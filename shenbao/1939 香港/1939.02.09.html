<p>社評</p>
<h3>迎擊日×的政略進攻</h3>
<p>本侵略我國，因在軍事進展下遇到困難，便不得不運用政治陰謀以策動和平，企圖分化我國抗日陣綫，削弱抗戰的實力，而在勝利的條件下結束戰事。這樣不僅可以消化已得的利益，而且足以瓦解我國的團結，使我國內部又囘復到抗戰前的紛爭狀態，於是可乘機從事更進一步的侵略。這種陰謀，雖屢爲我國堅强的抗日陣綫所粉碎，可是迄今不獨仍未絕跡，反和日本軍事進展困難程度的增高成正比例地熾烈起來了。</p>
<p>自抗戰轉入第二階段以後，日本對華的軍事不獨毫無進展，反益陷入困境。要進攻西北，則一敗於晉西，再敗於晉南，渡河企圖全成泡影；要打通粤漢路，則北旣頓拌於湘卾邊境，南又阻滯於花縣新街；要進襲西南，則又不能越北海三水。而各游擊區域，我軍游擊隊異常活躍，隨時隨地予以襲擊，以致窮於應付，進退維谷。不但如此，它自發動戰爭以來，國內財政已陷於山窮水盡之境，通貨膨脹，物價騰貴，民不聊生，反戰情緒日益高漲，很多大學敎授因反對戰爭而被捕，共產黨又大規模發動日本，朝鮮，台灣人民反戰運動。這些事實使日本統治者也痛感對華長期作戰的不利，於是便以策動和平的陰謀，爲其死裏求生的途徑。一面趁着英大使巡視華北的機會，假借華北民衆團體及在野名流的名義，發出通電，呼籲和平。一面利用德意軸心」，派貴族院議員松田，衆議院議員藏圓等來華，向意國駐華大使疏通，請他爲中日戰爭，出任調停。正在這個時候，德國因急切希望日本在華獲得勝利，便在重慶散佈「德蘇親善」，「反共協定」將成廢紙的烟幕，企圖藉此離間中蘇友誼，鬆懈我國的抗戰工作。</p>
<p>日本所以要趁英大使巡視華北的機會，假借名義，通電　和，目的除在分化我國的抗戰陣綫外，還想設法改變第三國對中國抗戰的觀感。因爲英國最近對我國的抗戰已有比較積極的認識；她不但和美法一致，對日本破壞國際條約，强佔外人在華權益提出抗議，且貸欵我國，作經濟的援助，予日本的侵華運動以相當的打擊。所以它不得不揑造事實，淆惑視聽，以冀减少英國對我國的同情與援助。可是華北人民已深知她的奸計，除通電全國，褐露她的陰謀外，又在英大使抵津的時候，投函聲明矢忠擁護國民政府抗戰到底，絕無呼籲和平的謬想，以闢邪說，而正視聽。至於她利用「德意路綫」引誘抗日陣綫中的少數不明大義，不顧事實的動搖份子，來分化我國的團結，因而使抗戰無法繼續的陰謀，也是心勞日拙，毫無效果。因爲自在精衞等××之後，主張走「德意路綫」的人，暫時消聲匿跡，不敢露面了。</p>
<p>十九個月以來，我國民衆艱苦犧牲的結果，已使全國民衆都澈底了解要完成民族解放，祗有全國團結抗戰到底，才能達到目的。我國根本是被壓迫，被侵略的國家，此次抗戰，完全是爲了受不過壓迫侵略，才起而自衞，也就是爲了民族生存，民族解放，才忍痛下了大决心，而走入抗戰的一途。戰是自衞，不戰便是投降，便是屈服，便是自趨滅亡！現在我國勝利的前途，日見光明，爲山九仞，怎甘功虧一簣？深望我中華全體國民，奮發堅苦卓絕的奮鬥精神，推進及協助政府，對內則加緊抗日各政黨團結合作的政治動員工作，加緊政治軍事黨務民運的改善與進步，加緊後方經濟建設及×人後方的戰鬥：對外則激底肅淸投降主義者的「德意路綫」，加緊中蘇兩大民族的親密合作，盡力爭取英美法各民主國家更切實更廣泛的援助。我們只有加倍努力運用這些對內對外的奮鬥原則，迎擊日×的政略進攻，才能最後也是最激底的戰勝×人！</p>
<h3>潮汕的青年救亡運動</h3>
<p>— 張問強</p>
<p>認識了民族危機的嚴重，不願做亡國奴的潮汕靑年，在七七以前就展開了潮汕民衆的救亡運動。因爲在政府的抗戰國策尙未决定以前，政治環境不容許民衆救亡運動的蓬勃開展，潮汕靑年的活動是以一種隱隱約約的姿態出現的。許多靑年的團體，如汕頭新文字硏究會，世界語學會，海潮話劇社，文藝座談會，各學校團體的時事討論會，都是以團結靑年，訓練靑年，敎育民衆，喚醒民衆，凖備偉大的時代到來的時候，担當起艱鉅的救國任務爲宗旨。當汕頭海潮話劇社籌備組織的時候，關於名稱的問題，就有人提出爲「國防話劇社」，當時大家都以爲國防兩字的意義，雖然最能表現工作的內容，是一個最好不過的名稱，但是，環境不容我們談國防，我們所　的正是人家過於知道我們是在幹救亡工作，所以大家同意採取一個比較灰色的名字。一個劇社的名稱之决定雖是小事情，却充分說明了當時的潮汕靑年，是在如何艱難的環境中，埋頭苦幹去推進救亡運動。經過了約莫一年的港滋暗長，潮汕靑年的救亡運動、已奠定了一個相當鞏固的基礎。</p>
<p>抗戰以前，潮汕靑年的救亡團體，都因爲不堪惡劣環境的壓迫，以致短命而死。但是潮汕靑年却不斷地花樣翻新，一個組織瓦解以後，另個新的組織又產生了。西安事變以後，中國政治已開始好轉，靑年的活動也比較自由了。所以，在一九三七年春天開始組織的文藝座談會，直至蘆溝橋事變發生的時候仍然存在，並且繼續發展。蘆溝橋事變發生以後，文藝座談會便在抗戰的高潮中立卽擴大並脫化爲汕頭靑年救亡同志會——後來改名爲靑年抗×同志會，成爲抗戰以來蓬蓬勃勃的潮汕靑年救亡運動之發屏的核心。</p>
<p>潮汕靑年救亡運動，在整個潮汕的民衆救亡運動中是骨幹，是精髓。潮汕靑年的活躍範圍，並不限於潮汕，西北東南各個戰塲，都有潮汕的英勇靑年在那裏學習，在那裏鬥爭。潮汕靑救運動是恤得注意的！</p>
<p>組織的普遍擴大和統一</p>
<p>汕頭靑救會成立在蘆溝橋事變發生不久之後，一般熱血靑年，自九一八以來在心裏醖醒了六年的民族仇恨的怒大，好像得了充分的養氣，立卽燃起了强烈的火燄，都集結在靑救的旗職之下，埋頭苦幹和大聲疾呼，掀起了汕頭靑救運動的高潮。</p>
<p>汕頭是潮汕經濟文化的中，一切社會運動發生於汕頭的，對於整個潮汕，都會起着領導及推動的作用。汕頭靑救運動的高潮，迅速地泛濫到全潮汕，靑年救亡同志會的組織，在短短的時間內各縣都建立起來了，如今，縣區鄕鎭都普遍地有了靑抗會的組織。潮汕靑年已經組繳起來了。</p>
<p>抗戰開始的時候，潮汕的育年抗敵團體只有少　政治認識比較高度，救國熱情比較濃厚的靑年參加，各縣市靑救會的會員，少的僅四五十人多的也不過二百人，全潮汕不滿三千人。雖然他們都是知識水凖相當高，工作能力相當　的靑年，成績的表現也相當好，相當地促進了民衆救亡運動；但是·還有許多的靑年，徘徊在救亡圈外，不能跟着前進靑年的隊伍，一齊朝着民族解放的大道邁進，未免埋沒了寶貞的靑年力量，是靑救運動中的一個缺點。塡補這一缺點是前進的救亡靑年之迫切的任務。</p>
<p>在抗戰的炮火響澈了全國的時候，在國防前綫的潮汕靑年爲什麽還不能一齊團結起來，準備仰擊迫在門前的×人？主觀上是因爲前進靑年的作風犯了錯誤，未注意到去吸引落後的靑年…在客觀上是因爲環境還未有極大的好轉，阻撓靑年活動的惡勢力還是存在。</p>
<p>自己的缺點經過事實的暴露以後，大家都感覺到應該立即把它克服。潮汕靑年過去有一個缺點，就是工作的態度表現得太前進了，不光是使農工靑年不能接近，就是大部份積極性稍爲薄弱的知識靑年，因爲未接受到吸引的力量，以爲自己跟不上人家，便不想去跟上人家，而停留在救亡圈外。一部份前進的富有熱情的靑年，好像脫了列車的火車頭，飛躍地前進，其行程雖速，其效果則微。然而也好像脫離了大隊的衝降隊，愈衝入×陣，愈覺得勢力的孤單，不能不稍爲慢進，配合了廣大的隊伍，才能克服當前的大×。潮汕各地靑抗會，在去年八一三舉行代表大會的時候，檢閱自己的隊伍的成員，都只是一部份前進的知識靑年，靑廣大的年羣衆，還未參加救亡的行列裏來，深切地感覺到自己在孤軍作戰的危險境地，遂立卽决定吸引廣大的靑年羣衆，擴大會的組織，作爲以後工作的重要課題。八一三後，潮汕各地靑抗會，都在努力擴大會的組織。客觀環境雖然僅有多少進步，阻撓靑年運動的勢力依舊存在，但是主觀的弱點相當地克服以後。救亡靑年的隊伍，已經有了迅速的擴大，汕頭靑抗會已由二百人發展到六百人，全潮汕靑抗會的會員已激增至一萬五千人以上。</p>
<p>在抗戰中，靑年的責任不僅是自身要熱烈地担負各部門的抗戰工作，尤須發動十千萬萬的農工羣衆，英勇地奔赴民族解放的戰場，潮汕救亡靑年的隊伍雖然在逐漸廣大强壯起來了，然而作爲持久抗戰之基本力量的　大的農　羣衆，還沒有動員起來，僅做到充實本身力量的工作，距離　救運動的眞正目標——喚起廣大的民衆——還是相當遙遠。所以，把組織　展到工廠田問去，使靑年和農工大　密切地聯系起來，已成爲目前潮汕　年擴大組織的工作方針。</p>
<p>潮汕靑年救亡團體的組織，當初是很散漫，沒有系統的。各縣市之上沒有一　統一的領導機關，一縣之中。縣靑抗會對於各區　抗會，區靑抗會對於各鄉靑抗會，也不相聯系，每一個靑抗會　是一個獨立的　　，僅在當地隸屬於民衆抗×後援會，緩受後援會的領導。所以各地靑　會同志都在孤軍奮鬥，彼此之間只有　　上的聯系，沒有組織上的聯系，也只有精神上的領導，沒有組織上的　導。汕頭靑抗會，工作的成績表現得比較好，也就無形中成爲潮　靑救運動的領導機關，然而，這個領導是不健全的。　（未完）</p>

<h3>日本下半年度預算案　陸海軍爭執甚烈　補充預算案月中提交議會　總額達六十萬萬日圓以上</h3>

<p>陸軍根據　兩強標準</p>
<p>本年之陸軍軍費總額爲五十四萬萬日圓、（卽二萬二千五百萬鎊）、明年之陸軍預算案、係基於一兩强標準』、使日本能同時應付中國與蘇聯、並維持在華日軍之力量、增　駐『滿洲國』之日軍、增强空軍實力及調整軍用品之供給等、此廣大之陸軍預算案、必將爲大藏省減少若干、但不致減至五十萬萬以下、</p>

<p>海軍省尚未將其要求發表、唯　相米內近日宣稱、日本必　實羅　　　計劃、控制　海、並與英美海軍造計劃用競爭、外間盛傳海陸兩者爭執甚烈、因陸省要求預算經費、極爲　大、致影響海軍方面之以展也、往年日本海陸兩有之預算經費、每作平衡之增加、但現時陸軍爲應　『中國事件』起見、必須要求鉅額經費、致海軍省經費蒙受影響、而必須减少若十、</p>
<p>特別豫算　數字驚人</p>
<p>下年度海軍經費預算案為六萬五千三百萬日圓、（三千八百英磅、）　本年度之海軍經費少二萬七千萬日圓、因在華海軍所　之經費、由特別預算撥付也、據悉海軍特別預算約爲十二萬萬日圓（郎七千萬）故下年度海軍預算總數達十八萬五千萬日圓（約一萬一千萬鎊）、依此各項數字推算、下年度日本海陸軍預算、總額達七十三萬萬　五千萬日圓（四萬萬另三千萬）、</p>
<p>海相米內　答覆質問</p>

<h3>光榮的胡鎮襲擊</h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>—返惠紀行之七—</p>
<p>到了胡鎭，會令記者想起胡鎮光榮的襲擊戰。於是立刻走訪那位協助作戰的胡祝南老英雄。幸　地在緝裏的一家店舖中會見了。胡老英雄年紀已有七十多歲，可是他炯炯的目光，斑白的鐵髯，仍不减靑年人的央氮。記者深致敬意後，便在熊熊的火爐旁邊　聽胡老英雄報吿這次光榮戰役的經過。</p>
<p>『是在十二月初旬，×人開始撤退了，車輛源源的通過』。胡老英雄爽快地開始了。</p>
<p>『當時駐防胡鎭附近担任游擊的一五七師連樹英營長，决意突擊，和我商量突擊的計劃。决定他們一營分爲三路，伏在蜆岡橋下二三里的山坳間，而由我殿後。』</p>
<p>『果然，我們埋伏了不久，×人的邋乒車已結隊而釆。我們待×車隊前頭的十餘輛過了，中路的立刻攔腰掃射，當場擊翻了四輛，其餘左右兩路也一齊動作起來。×人見有埋伏，卽把車輛完全停駛，排列在我們中路的射擊面內，總計百餘輛。在我們密集的火力下，又擊翻了八輛。車內的×兵像鳥獸的奔散，事後調査，擊斃約百名。我們左右兩路的部隊，見中路射擊的高興，竟把警戒的任務放棄了，也跑來中路射擊。×人便把前後頭車上的×兵約千人、分兩路包圍，我軍全部在不知不覺中陷人×人的包圍圈內。』</p>
<p>在這個形勢下，記者眞替我們英勇的隊伍揑了一把的大汗。但胡老英雄却很安閒地繼續的說：</p>
<p>「幸而我率領了八九十名子弟在山後瞭望，見着×兵漫山遍野分道合團，才從山後小路趕援，帶領了運營的隊伍冉從小路衝出×人的句園。」</p>
<p>「然則我們的隊伍沒有多大損失吧？」記者的心雖然寬鬆了許多，却仍免不了這個憂慮。</p>
<p>「損失？損失是很徵的，兩個弟兄經傷，一位姓陳的班長陣亡了！」</p>
<p>提起陳班長，老英雄的語調中有點嗚咽了。他說：陳班長，真是中華民族的壯士。最初，他在中路抱了一挺輕機關槍一馬當先，向着×車橫射，後來他覺得橫射殺傷的能力較直射爲小，便再扒向前方對着公路的土崗，將機槍朝着車頭射擊，使子彈從車頭直入，貫過車內，並入隣車。格格的槍聲中，眞不知取了多少×兵的生命。射擊約十分鐘，却給×人發現了位置，在×人幾挺機槍的集中回擊中。腿部受了幾處重傷，但這裏還不能表現出陳班長的偉大，還有更偉大的事跡在後面啊！</p>
<p>「當時連營長聽了他那挺機槍沒有聲響，知必受傷，呌了幾個弟兄冒險往救，扛回後方。他却對那幾位施救的兄弟說：「兄弟，我現在不濟了，扛囘也沒有用了。你們可把這挺機槍拿囘去，將兩個手溜彈揭開蓋交給我，待我將垂死的生命博回幾個×人！」那幾位的弟兄幾次的要求他囘去後方不肯，乃把兩個手溜彈交給了他，含淚而別。明天，×人退後，我們往尋他的屍骸，雖然他的屍骸破彈片炸後血肉糢糊，可是他屍骸的附近的草上，也消了兩塊很大的血蹟。先生，這偉大的事跡，還不是『驚天地，泣鬼神』的麽　所以我們便在那天於現岡橋邊的山上擇地公葬。」</p>
<p>「靑山有幸埋忠骨」，我想陳班長的英烈，不僅使靑山壯麗，也使山河壯麗。</p>

<h3>小評　漢奸與「日奸」</h3>
<p>中先社重慶六日電稱：『在僞組織任指導官及顧問之日人。近被發現同情我國抗戰者甚多。此輩日人被稱爲『日奸』，日軍特務部對僞組織中所有日籍職員，現已着手作總調査，凡有嫌疑者，立予解職，』又據東京七日電『外訊，日在現在發生「新間諜」恐佈，而此等『間諜』多係爲中國服務者』。「日奸」的出現，並且引起日本政府的張皇，足見日本侵華前途的危機，正在激劇的發展着，反轉來說，也足見我國團結抗戰前途的愈趨光明。</p>
<p>不過此種被稱爲『日奸』的，與我國的漢奸却不容『等紮齊觀』。爲什麽呢？先說漢奸，現在泛指一切遠背中華民族利益，甘供×人利用，破壞團結抗戰的中國人。他們或用『反共』「和平』煙幕，盡其挑撥離間陰謀，實行破壞團結抗戰；或用失敗主義投降理論，麻痺消磨我民族自尊心自信心；或爲×人作奸細，以消耗及毀滅我民族一切有生無生力量；這種人在中華民族是叛徒是奸細：同時因爲中國抗戰在國際意義上是保衞人類文明維護世界和平的戰爭，所以這種中國的叛徒與奸細，又爲世界人類的公敵。</p>
<p>反之，日本所發現的『日奸』在日本侵略陣營內執行失敗主義的策略，實行破壞戰爭的工作，以種種手段，在非常艱苦中，從日本國內以及侵華軍中，醖釀事變，增加日本侵略當局的困難，協助中國抗日戰爭的進展。這種人在日本侵略當局，固然要目爲奸細叛徒；在中國及國際意義上。則與中國戰士同爲保衛人類文明維護世界和平的英雄。卽從日本本國而言，因爲日本侵略外國的戰爭，只爲少數軍閥財閥爭取功利，不僅對於日本全國廣大人民毫無利益，並且將使日本人民在長期不斷的戰爭中喪失最低限度的生活條件，所以這些「日奸』的工作，完全適應日本人民自求解放的迫切需要的，不僅不能算是日奸，而且正是爲日本民族解放而鬥爭的英雄！</p>
<p>中國的失敗主義者和反戰運動者，是中華民族革命陣綫的敵人，也是日本民埃的敵人。同時，日本的失敗主義者和反戰運動者，是中華民族革命的友軍，也是日本民族的忠勇的戰士。我們要擴大宣傳，日本侵華戰事同時也是危害日本民族的戰事，中國抗日戰爭不僅自求民埃解放。同時也帮助日本民族解放。我們要歡迎與擁護日本共產黨及一切正義前進人士艱苦領導下的反戰運動，我們更要加緊肅淸中國潛伏的失敗主義者的反共反戰運動，爲了中日兩民族的解放，也爲了保衛世界和平與人類文明。</p>
<h3>德日的間諜同盟</h3>
<p>每天中午一位日本神士，驅車前往貝特勒路的德國軍部，穿過了敬禮的衞兵，走進一間莊嚴的辦公廳。廳內等待着的德國軍官，向他轉躬之後，便把手裏的一隻很重的箱子交給他。</p>
<p>日本紳士說一句『再會』，德國軍官也道聲「再會」，日本紳士，捧着箱子，彷彿母親抱着嬰兒似的，又走出大門，乘上汽車回到動物園路的一所莊嚴偉大的洋房裏去了。日本紳士就是駐德大使館武官大島大佐。從一九三六年一月廿六日起，他每天親自到德陸軍郁領取這隻箱子。</p>
<p>箱子裏面是裝着德國情報司派往外國的情報人員所獲得的報吿副本。照協約規定，德間諜搜羅的秘密情報所用的錢是日本負担。採獲的情報便交給駐柏林特務機關。這個奇特的協約是在德日防共協定同時簽訂了的。</p>
<p>大島大佐奉了日軍部荒木和著名日間諜土肥原的訓令，簽訂了這個協約，藉以減少日本間諜在外國活動所受的障礙。</p>
<p>日政府每年雖化了五百萬圓用在情報工作上面，當局認爲這筆費用，獲得材料不獨不够，且亦未必完全可靠。日本間諜因外表的關係，往往使他們在工作上發生很大的困難。世人看這些在外旅行的黄臉小子當作間諜，於是使得眞實從事探聽情報做間諜的人，往往被人們拒見。</p>
<p>土肥原看透這個缺憾遂不得不把目光注意到這些面貌並無顯者分別的國人來當充間諜。他派人在上海及新加坡的夜總會裏，羅致不少窮酸的白俄軍官，編成間諜隊伍。派一部份潛入俄境做傳遞的工作，寄囘長春報吿。用一百萬圓的經費設立這個組織，辦事人員，皆係在黑龍江鐵路做事的蘇俄職員，主扑事者係亞爾巴，他每週赴畏春報吿白俄間諜的工作。土肥原另有一批西洋間諜，假透　照派赴美洲活動，設法與海陸空軍軍官相接近。</p>
<p>許多時候，他們是和美軍官合作的。</p>
<p>一九三五年蘇聯的秘密警察探獲阿爾巴的陰謀，在他赴長春的途中把他拘獲，他供出日本間諜在蘇聯活動的名單，結果一無倖免，于一九三六年間全部明正典刑處决了。和他們合作的美軍官也在美國被捕，美國反間諜的陸軍部把整個在美的日本間諜，因此一網打盡。</p>
<p>這個間諜組絨的崩潰，自在意中，日政府幷不因此驚訝。和荒木寺內相接近的政客，認爲雇用沒有信用的白俄來做間諜，實係危險的政策。彼等主張成立一個可靠的間諜組織，這批人的首腦，便是法西斯主義組織的東方會社領袖中　正剛氏。</p>
<p>中野氏認爲日德須成立一個同盟，由兩國海陸軍部合資經營情報工作。他派了一位靑年二木喜多到柏林去試探合作的計劃，一九三二年他親自卦柏林直接接洽這件事。</p>
<p>他到柏林便把自己的計劃向德國軍部要人提出，已故上將史萊撤和情報司長潑利都上校表示無意合作。史氏的秘書瓦特感到很大的興奮，便把中野氏介紹給弋培爾和國社黨情報部的尼古拉上校，在國社黨內成立了日本情報處，開始交換情報工作了。</p>
<p>一九三三年希特勒登合，史萊撤退職，中野的建議由德軍部重新加以考慮後，得到了史萊撤氏勒敵的李乞奴的贊助，瓦特少校當時向當局提出報吿，爲政府採納，一九三四年便派他充駐日大使館武官，主持德日間諜的工作，一九三四年六月卅日史萊撤和潑利都便在國社簾政變中同時遭害了。</p>
<p>中野返日邀土肥原，荒木和陸相寺內等在家會談。瓦特也列席，發言甚多，宣稱德國頗願履行中野的策劃，同時幷成立一個反蘇共同協定的條約，他們坐在地氈上暍着綠茶，結紅這個日德間諜同盟，公推荒木大將負責拉攏海陸軍的保守份子贊助這項計劃。一九三五年果然海陸兩省當局一致贊成了中野的計劃了。</p>
<p>不久之後，便派了一位土肥原的爪牙大島氏　德主持事務，一九三六年他電吿中野說是這個協約在　已奏功効了（朱完）</p>

<h3>服務南潯前線</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>紅十字會南潯救護隊長吳文偉報告</p>
<p>敬禮—上前綫爲抗戰將士服務的朋友—你們的汗與將士的血，匯成有熱有力的民族解放急潮，寫成了璨爛偉大的民族解放歷史。你們，你們亦像抗戰將士一樣，是中華民挨優秀的子孫啊！</p>
<p>廣州紅十字會，於昨天下午三時假勝斯酒店招待記者，由該會南潯前綫救護隊隊長吳文偉報吿　綫救護情形及戰地見聞，記者聞訊，三步作二步　地準時踐約赴會。在會塲中，發　着黄色軍服，掛上紅十字徽章，滿有煥發精神的一位。料必就是從前綫南歸的吳隊長吧，記者急急地上前請問，搭着就叩詢記者所欲明瞭的幾個問題，吳隊長亦很熱誠地滔滔談着。正在談得出神的時候，賓客已經滿堂了，吳隊長就將談話吿一段落，正式開起會來。</p>
<p>家圍着長方形的桌子坐下。主席朱廣陶先報吿廣州紅十字會在內地工作的槪况，得悉他們的服務精神在炮　之下越是旺盛起來。此外，還有好幾位演說。下面的一叚，是綜合吳文偉隊長單獨對記者的談話及在席上公開報吿的速寫：</p>
<p>工作的動態</p>
<p>廣州紅十字會前線救護隊一行四十餘人帶了三輛救護車及一大批　物器材，在去年十月十七日就從廣州出發南潯綿服務，每月的費用約在二千元國幣，是由廣州紅十字會供給。在×機瘋在轟炸之下，前線盛傳這樣的一句話：「日間是×人的。夜間是我們的」。空襲讓它空襲，看看×人有多少　炸彈。可是從每天黄昏直到明天黎明，就是我們嚴肅地工作的時間了。</p>
<p>前方要　將士，後方要有民衆、中間呢？中間需要有聯絡者把前後方配合起來。該隊就是負起這樣的一個偉大的任務。好像從前方醫院　傷兵救護到後方去，又把後方醫院治療好了的將士護送到前線去。在南潯路上，以南昌爲中心，沿路設有很多救護站，除了救護傷兵，收界傷兵之外，還在救護站上供應茶水，帮助居民。再有女隊員到醫院看護，替傷兵修補衣服。當地各團體的衞生工作，亦由該隊盡力襄助。還設有救護訓練班培養新幹部。唱歌給傷兵聽，把車民拉任，起來開聯歡會……這種種亦都是他們工作的範圍。</p>
<p>最近，他們又奉命從南潯路到湘北了。現在，仍活躍在長沙一帶的地方。</p>
<p>可歌可感的事實</p>
<p>前綫帶花的士兵　然是性情有點暴燥，可是殺×的情緒却非常高漲。當有家屬到傷兵醫院探訪，不僅沒有表現悲喪的情態，而且很親切的互相慰勉，使人看了，不禁要掉下熱淚淚又在壯丁訓練　著成績的地方，當要出征的時候，老伯翁可　兒孫，妻子勗勉丈夫，都是以男子漢打倒×人爲最體面，無須有後顧之憂。使圍觀着的人羣，無不爲之感動。抗戰後的交通，亦是在突飛猛進中，從任何一方面看來，都顯示着我們是越打越强，最後勝利是絕對有把握的。所以當汪精衞發出屈服通電的時候，前線軍民無不憤怒異常，紛紛舉行座談會，發出聲討汪逆的通電。——從這裏，我們可以看出誰是背離了民衆的要求，誰就是被垂棄的落伍者了。</p>
<p>三點困難與展望</p>
<p>吳隊長還報吿三點工作的因難與展望：</p>
<p>第一，是人力的不够——像廣闊的戰區，幾十人的力量是不够分配的。如何使傷兵從前線迅速輸送到後方？如何使傷兵流少一滴血，減少一分痛苦？這只有希望後方的民衆踴躍上前線服務。</p>
<p>第二，是衛生藥物的缺乏——救傷兵要緊，救老兵更加要緊，因爲他有豐富的作戰經驗，有火山暴作一般的抗戰情緒。可是，最普遍的一爛　症一與「痢疾」…藥物就深深感到缺乏，這一點，很希望僑胞熱心捐助。</p>
<p>第三，是交通工具的缺乏——一輛救護車從前綫到後方，五六個鐘點才來囘一次，運送了幾個傷兵而已。交通工具實在是非常不够應用的。這亦是要希望僑胞的援手。</p>
<p>針對着這個人員與藥物需要補充的嚴重事實，所以，吳隊長不辭辛苦地從江西繞道浙江福建來港。將冉率領第二批隊員二十人於日間出發韶關，東江一帶在吳奇偉部隊服務。記者深願愛國的橋胞，瞻望着勝利，光榮的明天，對於這一羣英勇，苦幹的救護員，予以精神上，物質上的援助，抗戰一日未完，我們的責任亦一日未了啊！</p>

<p>交通旅行</p>
<h3>閩北游程</h3>
<p>— 王啓熙記</p>
<p>廿七年春，余與趙君志明附建陽汽車修理廠之材料車，由福州直往建陽，其間閩古路及甌古路兩段，當時尙未通車，（閩古路係由福州至占田至兮尙未通車；而　古路係由古田至建甌，最近始通車。）故路面甚瓖，加以雨中泥鬆，車行不易，同行二車中，一車半途相壞，抛錨路上者十餘日，余等亦　經艱險，始達建陽，已云幸矣！</p>
<p>旣至建陽，又北上至崇安，探武夷之勝，時正霉雨，時天公作美，放晴兩大，使得見名山霽日也。南歸之時，至南平附舟從劍溪回，得覽閩江上流之險，沿途所經，頗足談助，現福建省政府遷移內地，閩北地位更趨重要，則余等此次行程，當爲讀者諸君所樂聞也。</p>
<p>第一日　福州至古田</p>
<p>此次前往建陽之運貨氣車，兩輛，一爲『朋滋』牌柴油車，一爲『雲佛蘭』之汽油車，皆滿載材料。修理廠李主任，事前有信約余往遊，余則轉約趙君同行，余等與材料員王君皆搭於柴油車上，其他一車另由薛君壓送、兩車本伺時起程、但以速率不同、漸至分開、叩余等所乘者適前驅也</p>
<p>時細　濛濛、運貨汽車旣無坐位、又無車　、余等則有如貨物堆載車上、吾人深知行駛未通車之公路、其困難必多、則此行必苦、然苦中必更可樂也、</p>
<p>車由西門外出，公路多依山而築，工程已完成十之八九，所差者只路面與橋樑耳。故行駛者爲鬆而不實之路面，與臨時之橋樑，幸司機之技術甚佳，進行尙稱順利，下午車過雪峯，此地有一聞名之太寺，吾人可在車上望見之。</p>
<p>旣過雪峯，公路多盤山而上，工程可稱浩大，當車至山巔，如豋高凌空，稍有不愼，則粉身碎骨。間有山石滾落車前，則須設法栘去，始能前駛，然其困難尙有過於此者，路上所鋪之沙土，經雨後卽化成泥漿，載重汽車在泥漿中行駛，其結果如何，實不難想像，吾人但見車輪之滑動，而車身則不能寸　也。</p>
<p>然吾人，實不能讓汽車之拋錨，蓋在此公路上，縱拋錨至十天八大，亦無所補救。每次吾人必全體下車，親自道路，或塡以　土，或　以草皮，間有行走數里，雇鄉人助同推車。所幸此泥漿之路面，每段只三四丈，困離尙可克復。此種情形，一日之間何止五六次。</p>
<p>下午六時至古田，將車寄存公路工　處之古廟中。幷借其電話，探詢後車消息，方知尙水至羅橋。</p>
<p>古田爲閩北大縣，聞城外有大瀑布，名聞全國，可供兩省水電之用。是夜吾人宿城內某旅館，城內亦有電燈，其電壓未能乎均，致光暗不等，暗時僅兒紅絲，故須時時換用電壓不同之電燈泡，否則須加點蠟燭。</p>
<p>第二日　古田至建甌</p>
<p>早　時即冒雨出發，汽中沿甌古路前進，公路盤山而上，旋旋轉轉，更險於昨日者。中午經一峭峻之山路，雨中泥滑，卒無法前進，因下車築路，徒手工作，辛勞而無功，且車輪陷愈愈深，無法行駛，余等早上尙未進食，時腹中飢甚，乃至牛棚中稍息，并進乾糧，而期待意外之助，蓋除此別無辦　也。</p>
<p>果也大從人願，下午有工人七八個來，彼等負工具飯鍋等，似作長途旅行者。査詢之後，知彼等原係此段築路工人，因　工完竣，現將走　前往崇安。此去約須七八日，吾人因與其相商，中彼等代爲救車脫險後，允其附載車中搭往建陽，此種辦法，實爲雙方有利，因彼等若附載車中，則隨時可以造路，彼等本身之旅費及時間，亦節省數倍也。</p>
<p>此班工人，因有工具，故進行甚速，無異於開路之先鋒。且彼等與鄰近工人皆甚熟悉，經其尋集者共二十餘人，乃的車出諸泥中，繼續前進。</p>
<p>此後如路之障礙，或斜坡過峭者，此班工人則下車相推，以助馬力之不足。車至玉山，天已將晚，山高風冷，雲海茫茫，公路處人員勸在此過夜，吾人以種種不便，决繼續前進，乃開燈夜行。</p>
<p>此段路面稍平，且已計劃不久通車，故沿途有交通標誌。何處灣路，何處斜坡，何處橋樑，何處危險，可先得啓示，夜間有此，勝於南針，是夜八時車至建甌。</p>
<p>建甌爲閩北要縣，故當時有省政府遷移建甌之說，所產以米，紙，竹，筍，菇，及木料爲大宗。香菇係由人工造種，聞造菇工人皆爲浙江某縣人，已成世傳之特植職業，每年造菇季開始時，此項工人深入高山者，不下十餘萬人。</p>
<p>此外建甌尙出產方竹一種，可爲早煙管及手杖等之用。可供人雅玩，其價格亦頗貴，視雕工之粗細而定。</p>
<p>是夜宿建甌城內某旅館，談笑甚歡。因吾人已經過種種困難，明日卽可到建陽也。</p>
<p>第三日　建甌至建陽</p>
<p>建甌王建陽凡五十公里。此段公路早已通車，而司機者對于路上情形甚爲熟悉，吾人于早上八時許由建甌出發，十時許卽望見一塔，知己至建陽。車至修理廠，由李君沈君招待，兩君為余在上海時多年同事，相見甚歡，因將行李搬至廠旁宿舍中暫住。</p>
<p>是日爲星期日，因至李君家中午飯。李君新婚，住建陽城內，離廠甚近，其夫人招待甚殷，盛意可感。飯後聞鐘聲，知係空襲警報，但未見飛機。</p>
<p>下午天又陰雨，由李君領帶，乘坐小汽車，往城內參觀公路情形。此處公路，四通八達，南通延平凡一百十八公里。北達崇安凡六十一公里。西經邵武而至光澤，凡一百十公里，由光澤至江西之南昌計二百七十五公里。　至浦城凡一百十七公里，而浦城至浙江之江山凡一百十二公里。建陽爲諸路之中心點，故汽車修理爲閩北之冠，工作亦甚忙。李君謂每年山洪暴發時，各路溪流處之橋樑多有衝壞者，致車輛不能通行，而修理廠之工作亦暫時停頓，然吾人當時所見之溪流，橋樑離水尙二三丈，不料洪水來時，有如是氾濫也。</p>
<p>建　尙無　廠，故修理廠之機器皆自備發　機，工作管理皆有成績，聞不久將添設發電機。夜間因無路燈，故甚形黑暗，李君請余住其城內家中，余則謹辭，巧住車廠附近之職員宿舍中，與趙君同見一室，目王君沈君皆係友好，頗不寂寞。宿舍在樓上。其樓下爲聯保辦事處，天井中陳設蘭花多盆。憶余等日間所見之住家中，多亦陳設簡化，蓋福建亦產蘭之地，別有一種，稱爲「建蘭」，葉闊而勁，長二尺餘，秋初出花莖，莖之上部開數花。淡黄綠色，香氣幽雅，建陽之蘭，意必　地土產，因蘭住幽谷，此處又得山水之秀也。</p>
<p>第四日　建陽</p>
<p>早上醒來，不見陽光，而一夜淫雨尙未停也。預定武夷之遊，未能成行，乃與趙君同往城內遊覽，建陽城垣尙未拆毀，但範圍不大。吾人不及半日時間，已將縣政府，汽車站，四城門，及街起等處遊遍。</p>
<p>建陽土產，有杳菇，冬筍，芥菜　口蓮，茶葉，等。芥菜高可二尺，味甚豐美。口蓮爲無心之連子，其中苦心已由女工一一將其吮出，故名「口蓮」。茶葉皆採自武夷　，種類甚多，如茗種，白鷄冠，水仙種，大紅袍，鐵觀音等。以大紅袍最爲名貴，趙君購二兩裝者，價二元，如在他處，其價當倍於此也。</p>
<p>物品除土產外，有由浙江運來者，吾人曾向一商店購雨傘兩把，準備明天冒兩遊武夷。福州紙傘固甚有名，但台人購得者却爲杭州之傘，蓋自杭江鐵路通車後，閩浙之轉運甚爲利便也。</p>
<p>夜李君等宴余及趙君，席間談論建陽事頗多，知此處有朱子讀書處，吾人如有機會亦擬一遊。又聞建陽多瘧疾，廠中工人犯此疾甚多，故吾人所見廠中備用藥，而獨「愛斯匹靈」之藥瓶常空也。</p>
<p>第五日　建陽至武夷　（祟安）</p>
<p>今日大氣放晴，眞出吾人意料之外。因附車往遊武夷山。建陽至公館凡四十五公里，公館至赤石尙有八公里，其中因久雨致播樑爲水衝壞。汽車不能直達　安　須以竹筏渡溪，幷步行四五里，方至赤石，赤石為中國有　之茶市，惜久經兵燹，十室九空，皆呈不景氣之現象。吾人至赤石時，近中午，因稍進麵食，幷雇一鄕童爲嚮導，入武夷巖。</p>
<p>武夷在崇安縣南三十里（華里）。爲　霞山脈之起頂，相傳昔有神人武夷君居此，故名。全山綿亙百二十里有三十六峯三十七巖之勝。吾等沿途經蝦蟆石，三姑石，凉傘峯，而至天心之永樂禪寺。是爲全山　中心，遊覽者必先至此。由知客淸希和尙招待，乃住寺前客房中。</p>
<p>飯後游鷹嘴峯過大心嶺，至劉官寨，聞有名之大扛袍茶葉卽產此處，再經　焰峯，而至水簾洞，巖高百丈，望如掛幕，有泉從巖頂瀉下，激成水簾，如敎珠，如散玉，歎爲奇觀，其旁爲神通巖。</p>
<p>路過流香　，漬中多香草幽蘭，故有此名。至七星巖，有懸空樓閣，聞係從　修道者所居，現已寂無人，所謂樓閣，實懸空之小屋耳。然危岩高過百尺，其上無徑可通，此小屋　不知若何而建，若何而居也。</p>
<p>山中遍種茶樹，多高不盈尺，最高者　不過三四尺。茶園皆依巖石，堆以山土，因雲霧巖之美妙環境，故生此世界聞名之巖茶。當茶春一至，則滿山採茶人多，山歌相和，當另有一番氣象突。</p>
<p>歸寺後寺僧出奇種請品茶，知客淸希聞係出身軍界，但談吐甚風雅，與其對話，頗有禪機。</p>
<p>第六日　武夷山</p>
<p>武夷之巖景以天心天游最勝，水景則以九曲溪著名，天游現在建築中正公園，大於今日往游焉。</p>
<p>早上寺僧代爲顧一工人，領導遊覽，過磊石岩，有岩石三相依，故名，其旁有磊石精金。再行至馬頭巖，下爲凝雲道院，門前桃花流水，不同凡俗。有老道居之，蓋武夷爲道家三十六洞天之一，故山中頗多道院。</p>
<p>再經悟道澗，胡麽澗等處，中午至天游，此處古人題詠石刻甚多，本有禪寺，已毀於火，現在重建中。登高一望，可見曲曲溪流，其下有金雞洞諸勝。按其方向，當在六曲七曲之間。</p>
<p>遊罷天游，仍囘天心寺，途過三仰峯，爲全山最高峯，峯凡三起，有如筆架形，嚮導者謂其上有險洞，居修道道人，不易尋訪　此卽古詩所謂「只在此山中，雲深不知處」歟。</p>
<p>時有兒童十餘，鳴　打　持燈遊行者，山行有此遊伴，頗不寂寞，問之知係由星村來者，此行乃往天心寺進香。星村離此二十餘里。亦爲有名之茶市也。</p>
<p>傍晚有雨意，禾使出遊，連日寺僧招待甚慇，茶，點，　，飯，無不齊備。夜間大氣甚冷，竟下雪花。與趙君圍爐閒詀，幷聯吟一詩；</p>
<p>得覽名山亦壯哉，此行半爲品茶來。</p>
<p>水簾珠玉憑空瀉，巖石精華自古開。</p>
<p>綠樹採香春應鬧，×軍遺劫景堪哀。</p>
<p>明朝買筏辭僧去，九曲溪流一日囘。</p>
<p>第七日　武夷至建陽</p>
<p>早上天雨，因冒雨遊九曲溪。溪流甚淺，下有石卵，須泛以竹筏，如沿溪行，亦可領略　趣。考武夷山圖所繪，沿溪風景甚多，特錄之以供參考：</p>
<p>一曲——一曲畫院，止止庵，豋仙台武夷宮。</p>
<p>二曲——玉女峯，陵霄峯，宴仙巖。</p>
<p>三曲——五虎峯，大藏峯，小藏峯。</p>
<p>四曲——天柱峯，更衣台，李仙巖，御茶園，通仙　，下馬坑，大觀音，小觀昔，方印石，鏡台，輸墨石，二迴石，上城高，下城高。</p>
<p>五曲——宋文公祠，大穩屛，仙掌巖，伏虎洞，羅漢洞，小穩屛，</p>

<h3>消滅我蠶絲業之陰謀</h3>
<p>— 吳馬</p>
<p>總之、條件雖然僅僅是五條、已是十足道地的毒辣兇狼、足使中國原有的一點蠶絲基礎、摧毀無遺、戰區蠶種塲的經營者如果還有一點人心、如果還能把眼光放遠大些的語、應該斷然的拒絕、　三、今後的兩條路綫</p>
<p>聽說大有蠶種場在獲得這種優越的合作條件之後、當時並沒有毅然的接受、而凖備用吳縣蠶種業同業公會的名義、呈請偽江蘇省政府建設廳、表示反對、蠶場的不贊成與日方合作、當然是可喜的現象、但僅僅是請求偽政府援助、我們不管這種方法應用得得當與否、單就効果方面而言、也是絕對不够的、因爲漢奸們服從「他們主于」之不暇、那裏還再敢進什麽意見—這種認識上的錯誤、在全民挨總動員的全面抗戰的現在、似乎太不應該、然則、在這種惡辣的壓束之下、各種場應該如伺對付、這、我可以說除掉絕對的不合作主義外、無他途、但這裏的所謂不合作主義、却並不是消極的把蠶種塲停辦、就算完事、</p>

<h3>港菲埠際賽前奏曲　今天港隊練習賽　下午五時在海軍場舉行　與港聯對壘門票收二角</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】港菲埠　足球大戰之期、迫在眉睫、球國衆　、飽眼福之將辛、</p>
<p>港埠際隊代表、經於本星期一那天的晚上、在總會遴選委員們擇尤錄用的原則下產生出來、正選中華人六名、李惠堂則被舉爲隊畏、這是眞够體　的、</p>
<p>整個陣容、沒有什麽不滿人意的瑕疵、雖然許多人料不到右翼一職、早拉竟會入選、但記者對此、甚表贊同、據我所知、菲方球員的氣力最充足、動作最矯捷、守衛快打慢是其所畏、故港隊前綫必須用一二位擅於衝刺的人物、才是上策、阜拉所以入選、正因爲他衝刺够兇、遂爲遴選委員們所賞識、</p>
<p>前衞線海軍佔二人、一爲狄臣、一爲韓尼維路、這兩位良好的球藝、早已爲一般迷民所共悉了、惟有一點頗堪注意的、凡是海軍的前衛、多好盤球出擊、狄韓二氏、亦同此種作風、在足球戰略上　、如不是採用第三內衛法的隊伍、則那担任中堅的、爲推動已方前線之進展、使不能不出擊、但仍須見戡而行、據我聽聞菲隊的前線作戰頂快、最善突襲、故狄韓二氏、屆時須提防及此、</p>
<p>今天下午五時、埠際隊與港聯隊舉行練習賽於海軍球場、在理、埠際隊應以港聯爲假想敵、然其最大目標、須求全隊發揮一致的合作功夫、及明瞭各個職責上的聯繫、那才不失此次檢閱的意義、</p>
<p>這個羣英會、　出的定多悅目可觀、門票一律二角、尤是便宜、　兩陣如下、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>校際乒乓賽　明日頒獎　表演賽冠軍對選手</h3>

<h3>明年世運會全部項目　共計百四十七種　男女新節目增添多種　經費預算芬幣二萬萬</h3>
<p>（芬京一月三日訊）芬蘭當局自積極籌備下屆世運以來、進行極當迅速、議會爲充實籌備經費起見、業已通過特別預算、具總數　爲芬幣二萬萬馬克、（依目前匯率計算、約爲獎金一百萬鎊、美金五百萬元、）至經費不足之數、共爲一萬萬馬克、已由海爾斯基市政府、撥欵彌補、該市政當局現正興工建築奧林匹克村、地點位於近郊樹林茂盛之區、空氣淸新、交通便利、各國選手之宿舍共二十九所、皆係三層之新式建築物、其臥室總數則爲二千五百間、又全體代表之會食堂、亦將開始建造、至該村總辦事處則擬設於小學內、</p>
<p>上届世運在柏林舉行時、比賽節目共爲一百二十九項、但芬蘭此次舉行之大會節目、則將增加三項、總計田徑賽二十三項、室內運動八項、游　及水　等十六項、划船　項、游艇四項、小艇賽九項、角力十四項、舉重五項、拳擊　項、射擊五項、劍衛七項、騎術六項、足球一項、滑翔二項、及現代五項運動一種、査上屆世運會中曾有手　曲棍球、馬球籃球及女子室內運動等比賽、也一九四〇年之上二屆大會中、上述各賽均停止舉行而另以其他新節目替補之、此項新節目爲（一）萬米競走（二）女子鉛球（三）女子跳遠（四）女子二百米賽跑、此外更新增三百米及五十來之步槍打靶賽二項、至於滑翔比賽、亦係前所未有之節目、故全部項目、已達百三十二種之多、另加藝術比賽十五種、則共爲一百四十七種、</p>
<p>將來舉行比賽時、世界各大報館及通訊社、均將派遺記者蒞會、以每日比賽狀况、向外傳佈、鑒委會方面、爲優待『無　帝皇』起見、决於會塲內設座位六百個、記者席之分配、以各該國之選手人數爲比例、</p>
<h3>中國足球名裁判　加入英國裁判會</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】中國足球名裁判樂秀榮沈囘春二氏、由上海西人足球會介紹、加人英國足球裁判會爲會員、業經該會通過、一九三八—三九年會目證、已由郵寄到滬、此後樂沈兩氏於英國足球裁判會管轄下之任何比賽、均可執行職務、聞下届祖任西聯甲組賽之華裁判、亦將由該會介紹加入英國裁判會、按華裁判曾有數人由全國體育協進會介紹那入萬國足球裁判會爲會見、而華裁判爲英國裁判會員、實以樂沈兩氏爲嚆矢云、</p>
<h3>早操的效能</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）我自參加廣東省立體專留港同學會第二次座談會後、便引起了我對于香港體育、發生了種毬問題、這問題、時時也掛在心頭、一刻也不能按下去、『早操』、就是我最注意的一　、僑胞們、大家想想、寸金尺土的香港、　于空氣方面、當然要發生重大的問題、在過去的報吿、肺結核病而死亡的佔最多數、這就是一個最明顯的証明、我們要解決這個　　、當然不能以向外求的方法——食樂注射、必不是根本的可以解决、是必在內裏找尋、研究、才能得到最適當的辦法、這就是最重要　、每個人都應該實行的「淸晨運動、」</p>
<p>僑胞們、大家對于最重要的「早操」太輕視了、甚至很多學校也不能法意到、這是最可惜的事情、雖在香港方面、對于體育的環境不好—實行運動的場所太少、　不應該給環境的克服我們、更要充分的利用環境去實行運動。如天台　樓、甚至巷道等做我們的運動場、也無不可、祗看我們會不會用它吧、</p>
<p>我無論到那個校學團體去、對着學生們最喜歡說的一句話、就是、「天天依時去早　、萬事不怕糟」、懇望僑胞們、及體有的同志們、能够把我這似覺不合理的說話去實行實行、但你的確有勇氣去實行時、還須要遵守着「按時睡眠」「依時起床」的規律、（卓特）</p>
<h3>運動簡訊</h3>

<h3>對於兒童體格鍜鍊應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>在這個優勝劣敗、弱肉强食的世界中、殘暴的戰爭是不能避免的、我們如不願做奴隸的父母、唯有從今日起、積極鍛鍊我們兒童的體格、以備應付將來的遭刦、所以今日爲父母者、積極提倡體育、不僅爲國家謀生存、也是爲子孫媒最人的幸福、</p>
<p>強國須先強種、今日世界各國沒有不注重體育的、強種必須從兒童入手、</p>
<p>兒童的體格鍛煉法與成人不同、這並非完全是因為兒童沒有能力勝任成年人的運動、而是兒童在身與心上的需要不同的緣故、譬如、散步和騎自行車、對於成年人都是很好的運動、兒童的體力雖也足以勝任、但是這咱運動對於兒童却不很適宜、因為這各運動祗有益於身體的一部或　部、并不能使全身平均發展、所以對於兒童、就會構成身體發展不平均的弊害、此種弊害足以影響兒童身體正常之發育或生長、以及將來的體魄、</p>
<p>最適宜於兒童的運動　是有系統的徒手體操、這種體操也要因年齡與身體强弱不同而異、徒手體　對於兒童、在體格和倫理上的鍛鍊皆有很大的功效、並能訓練兒童的自信力、意志、適應環境的能力、友道、忠義品格等等</p>
<p>徒手體操對於「時」「地」「物」然雖都是最經濟的、但仍有不少兒童、因環境關係連這種機會也沒有、所以有人以為欲提倡這種運動、非由政府、公共團體、敎育當局如學校等切實施行不能收獲最大的效果、這雖不無理由、但最有效的方法就是一方面由上述各機關切實提倡、另一方面使這種空氣深入家庭之中、爲父母的人對於健康的重要和這種運動也要有深切的認識、</p>
<p>在中學和小學的學　中、體育雖爲必修的課程、實行以誘導和强迫的方法來提倡體育、但是結果並無顯著的成績、甚至、因此而受害者爲數亦不少、考其主要原因、不外指導無方、效員不能盡職、對于體育也沒有深切的認識、以及忽視運動、與年齡或各人身體需要不同的關係、例如、以表年或成年人時運動施于兒童、這就是一個重大的錯誤、其他方法上的錯誤實不勝枚舉、</p>
<p>體格鍛鍊對於兒童實較靑年與成年以及老年爲重要、童年時期不僅爲我們一生的基礎、我們在童年時期身體尙未成熟、體格鍛煉雖然很重要、但是如運動方法稍有錯誤、對於身體反而有重大的損害、對于將來也有很大的影響、</p>
<p>兒童多數是好動的、雄然也有極少數對於運動不感興趣、對於前者、我們當然要以適當方法來指導他們、最可惜的就是不知有多少愛好運動的兒童、因指導無方而把他們　大的將來葬送、對於後者、我們要啟發他們的興趣、硏究他們對於運動不感興趣的原因、</p>
<p>過則勿憚改、祗要我們决心改良、任何事皆不政太晚、對於健康或身體有關的要索必須切實注意、尤其是童年、在這個時期、如養成不良習慣、至成年時則不易破除、體格鍛鍊也是如此、並且在童年的時候、對於日常生活就應養成良好的習慣、先建立强健的基礎、準　應付將來劇重的負担或是惡劣的環境、</p>
<p>兒童運動的主要目的是增進健康、重于軀幹和內臟的鍛鍊、發達肌肉即尙屬次要、</p>
<p>至於肉體和精神上的發展、沒有兩個人是完全相同的、所以兒童的體格鍛煉並無一定的標準、當然也不可忽略各人不同的需要、或身心不同的發展、一律施以同樣的運動、（上）</p>
<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……夢裏情人</p>
<p>The　Shopworn　Angel</p>
<p>片中描寫兩個受着不同命運所播弄的靑年男女、一個是眞摯誠懇的農家子弟、將給無情的戰爭遣送到前綫去、另一個是靈魂上滿受創傷、命途多舛的掘金女伶、他們都在可怕的現實中、尋求『夢』的滿足、而夢一般的「愛」給他們不少的鼓勵和安慰的、</p>
<p>瑪格烈莎麗文、在本片中飾演一個飽經世故的掘金女伶、她犧牲了另一有錢男子對她所献的殷勤、而在特別的情境之下、接受另一個已經應徵入伍、眞摯誠懇的靑年男子的愛、雖則她充份明白、過慣了奢靡淫逸生活的自己、和這質樸靑年的愛、是絕對難成事實的、但却爲了玉成那靑年的美夢、而在他將臨出發之前一刻、和他結婚、</p>
<p>本片對於美國參加歐戰時動員的情形、和充滿着緊張戰爭氣氛的社會動態、有極活潑迫眞的描寫、瑪格烈莎麗文在「戰後三友」一片中優異的演出、留給我們一個難以磨滅的印象、在本片中也因性格的適台、而有令人極滿意的演作、傑姆史蒂華在片中的演技、也像他在「七重天」中同樣的優秀動人、餘如華爾特皮金也能稱　、</p>
<p>皇后平安　同映……春心綺念</p>
<p>Youth　Takes　A　Fling</p>
<p>片中描寫一個擬情女店員、追求她所夢想的人、而不幸那男千却有些獃氣、除了醉心航海事業之外、沒一件事物値得他的注意、女人當然也不能例外、就是多情嬌麗如那女店員、對他所献的慇勤、也絲毫得不到他的歡心、末了還决然的想遠避她的糾纏、但暈浪的痛苦、打破了他航海的迷夢、也醫好了他無情的毛病、</p>
<p>本片雖則儘可能的以各種場面、如時裝表演、公共游泳塲等鏡頭、來充實內容、但尙未能完全掩飾本片內容空虛的缺點、演員方面、安持麗烈絲尙有旖旎動人的演作、至於飾那醉心航海的靑年的佐麥克利、雖則他對於性格的表現、太爲跨張一點、但他却是片中自始至終趣味的中心人物、</p>
<p>東方……浪漫夫人</p>
<p>The　Divorce　of　Lady　X</p>
<p>英國亞歷山打柯達出品、故事寫一家倫敦的大飯店裏開宴會、恰遇迷天大霧、使一輩貴容不得回去、而就向飯店裏借房間、因人多房少、就有一位年輕的夫人、闖進一个單身男子的房裏、故事就這樣的展開、演出極爲風趣、頗有美國風味、曼兒奧白朗演出恰到好處、男主角是英國明星、演出平平、</p>
<p>大華……第八夫人</p>
<p>Bluebeard's　Elghth　Wffe</p>
<p>鼎鼎大名的大導演劉別謙、一向以他那種輕鬆優妙的手法、導演了許多愛情喜劇、出現在我們目前、這張片子、劇情止合他的特長、駕輕　熟、成績當然是相當優越、且以賈萊古柏和克勞黛考爾白分任劇中男女主角、如錦上添花般、湊成這張値得一觀的片子、本來賈萊古柏是以演西部牧竄着稱、在這兄似乎才非所用、雖則他已盡了他的力量、可是比起克勞黛老爾白來、似乎還差些、</p>
<p>新世界……摩登女招夫</p>
<p>粤語片</p>
<p>就是舞上的『摩登女招夫』所改編、劇情是叙述一個家產百萬的富翁、慳吝異常、對於一切公益事業、非但一毛不拔、反要想法來佔人家便宜、這時因爲各界發起籌欵建立難民工業廠、想請他帮忙、可是結果他非但沒有拿出一點錢來、反而在會議席上、揩油了幾件西點、於是衆人設法想出這『摩登女招夫』的辦法來、想他來上當、再用女色來誘騙他、</p>
<p>主處是舞　紅伶、馬師曾譚蘭卿、也是製片家的生意眼</p>
<p>關於導演的手法還相當靈活</p>
<p>中央……胡惠乾打機房</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>爲了「方世玉打擂台」一片的賣座成績特佳、聰明的製片商看准了生意眼、本片就是動機中產生的、</p>
<p>胡借乾軟弱不堪、被機房中人欺凌、父旣被害、尙欲佔其妻妹、胡惠乾爲環境所迫、决定離開機庚、赴少林寺學藝、以便將來報仇、經過了不少的困苦和危險、在某一天他果然回來、卒報父仇、本片劇情就是這樣簡單、導演無手法可言、鄺山笑改變作風飾胡惠乾、演來尙可、徐人心已久別銀壇、本片中馮婦再作、演出尙佳、全片佈景太簡單、幾塲打武亦不見緊張、</p>
<p>利舞臺高陞　同映……花木蘭</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個現代的女子、因爲曾經演出過舞台上的「花木蘭」、因此她時時想做一做現代的『花木蘭』、果然在國難嚴重的時候、她實現了她的志願、原因是她發現了一個組織很有規律的漢奸機關、於是就和她的情人鄺山笑、共同設法破此秘密機關、盜取文件、不知道經了多少的困難、他們總於達到了目的、連伶俐志昏的漢妤們、也被他們偉大的精神所感化了、共同出發到前線去、</p>
<p>我們不否認這劇情在華南是較好的一部、也是還相當牽强、導演不能利用電影的技巧、鄺山笑陳雲裳之演技甚　、</p>
<p>太平……兒女英雄傳</p>
<p>國片</p>
<p>因爲沒有神怪片那樣不合情理的地方、新華公司這張片子還算不怎麽壞、雖然也說不上是有怎麽好的成績、全劇中許多應當緊張些的地方、却平淡的放過去了、顧蘭君——這位戰後紅得發紫的女星——表演還錯不、</p>

<h3>是非之觀</h3>
<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>此亦一是非，彼亦一是非，是非本來難於一定，甚至有些人說，是就是非，非就是是，就因爲是於此者，也許非於彼，反之，非於彼者，也許是於此，女子白而頎長是大多數文明國家所認爲美的條件，在非洲，却以黑而肥矮爲美的極致，再要舉例，當然指不勝屈。</p>
<p>爲了各楚其是，各非其非，不能彼此是非相同的緣故，所以個人與個人之間，便發生了爭執，口角，以至鬥毆，國與國之間，便發生了抗議，絕交，以至相交戰，爭一些是非，便惹成了「是非」。</p>
<p>然而是非眞的絕對沒有標凖麽？不見得，標準到底是有的。就以美惡而論，愛美而惡惡，就是一致的，雖然美惡的標準不同。再說，古往今來，由中及外，也正有許多一成不變的眞理，確定了是非的範疇，有如人吃飯，狗吃屎，那樣的牢不可破。所謂一成不變的眞理，則有；仁愛，信義，和平，公正，……等項，誰也不敢說，不會說，這些德性是壞的，是「非」的，我們人類不應予以發展而予以剷除的。</p>
<p>然而「聰明人」——其實是無恥之徒，却另有歪曲事實，顚倒是非的本領。明明是侵略，却說是親善。明明是出賣民族，却說是求「民族生存」，明明是壟斷與獨覇，却說是維持共同利益，門戶開放。明明叫別人做他們的奴隸，供他們利用，却說做他們的朋友，共享榮華。……總之，他們明明知道何者爲是，何者爲非，却不惜將非作是，將是作非：並且要別人也和他們一般的是非不明，而盲從他們的是非。</p>
<p>我想，假如他們一直這樣胡鬧下去，也許竟有一天成了習慣，他們的良知就此冺滅，就此的確認是爲非，認非爲是起來，因此，我們要吃飯，也許他們要說，飯吃不得，還是吃屎，或者說，屎就是飯，更或者說，他們從來就是吃屎，此後也將一直吃屎。</p>
<p>最近，據說這班惹起「是非」之徒，正在處處鼓其如簧之舌，顚例黑白，格外宣傳着他們的邪說，要我們和他們「「合作」，以他們的是非爲是非。我想，「是非之心，人皆有之。」我們不見得便會上他們的當罷，「無是非之心，非人也！」，附和邪說者，也就成爲不吃飯的人，而成爲吃屎的狗了！</p>
<h3>小影</h3>
<p>— 瑾瑜</p>
<p>在凌亂的行囊中，我檢出一個方寸的小影。</p>
<p>對著這幅方寸的小影，脆弱心中，又掀起他美麗的，光榮的生命底前頁。</p>
<p>明亮的燈光下，不是現顯着他年靑的容貌麽？誰相信這麽一個英俊的，爲正義而鬥爭的戰士，仁慈的上帝會殘酷地搶奪了他的生命？</p>
<p>出雲艦上的轟炸，太湖上空的夜襲。</p>
<p>光是　　　傳誦？保衛武漢的空戰，遠跨東海的長征，又給祖國民衆爭回了多少光榮啊！他有良好的環境，他有美滿的家庭，靑春的華年，該是多麽的幸福，可是，爲了祖國民族的生存，他終于把寶食的生命，在滾滾東流的長江上跟×人的戰艦同歸于盡！</p>
<p>小影下不是淸晰地這樣寫着麼？「請纓早勵從軍志，不斬樓闌誓不還」！怎麽，題簽的墨跡尙那樣鮮明，而寶貴的生命就永遠離開了人間。</p>
<p>煩亂的檢閱，心欵上壓不着浮上了一層淡淡的哀愁。除了有着宛惜他華年短促的心情，就覺得生長在櫻花島國的人們，是一羣多未可咀咒的東西！</p>
<p>小影裏英勇的遺容，把我的心染上了悲哀和憤恨，抗戰的砲聲，彷彿在嘲笑我懦弱得是多末可憐。</p>
<h3>台灣外紀</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>……民族小說話</p>
<p>此書乃淸初江日昇所作。寫的是鄭成功及其子孫的始末，首列康熙甲申岷源陳祈永的序和「鄭氏世次」。有求無不獲齋原刊本，上海申報館排印本以及文明書局石印筆記小說大觀本，計三十卷。每卷都繫以七字聯，可見是以一卷當作一囘的。「筆記小說大觀」所收章囘小說，僅此一種，但嚴格說來，此書如果除去七字聯的回目，與普通的文言筆記「竊憤錄」之類就沒有什麽很大的分別了。</p>
<p>因爲這是淸初的作品，或者爲了不願落入文綱起見，寫序的人不免有偏袒異族之嫌：「成功以隆武賜姓，逃竄海外。奉閏運故朔三十有七年，仗義守節，庶幾田橫之選。然以我朝視之，則固勝國游魂。海隅窮魄，律以犯邊梗化，夫復何辭，敬惟我皇上神功聖烈，度越千古，而鄭氏叛則討之，服則撫之；又仰見皇仁浩蕩，格外矜宥，聿成中外一統之治、億萬年丕基定於此矣。」我以爲卽使在環境壓迫之下，像上面這樣的話究竟是逾越了容忍的範圍。好像這幾句話並非不得已纔說的，頗有阿諛討好的成分在內。這樣說來，我們即使爲陳祈永迴護，也無從說起了。</p>
<p>江日昇是福建人，以福建人來寫福建的事，當然有許多材料是他省人所不知道的。近日余宗信的「明延平王臺灣海國記」就曾採用本書作爲重要的材料之一。</p>
<p>此書以鄭成功及其子孫爲經，另外還以明末的動亂爲緯。著名的如卷四寫祟禎帝弔死煤山，卷五寫「黄道周南京盡節」之類。</p>
<p>鄭成功的部分僅卷六到卷十二。在這七卷中又只有卷十至十二是比較緊張的。因爲是用文言寫的，想像不豐富，所以頗少成功之處；描寫得比較出力的甘煇也不能顯示他的個性。但此書比之「七峯這編」，似乎還要好一點。</p>
<p>江日昇的態度和作序的人一樣。如卷六云：「成功統秣習山甘煇等犯同安」。「賊勢浩大」。稱鄭成功爲賊，成功想要恢復失地便算是寇兵犯境。卷十云：「梁化鳳因海寇直入瓜鎭，隨繞道至江南」。卽第三人稱的旁觀者的口氣也仍然稱鄭成功爲海寇，未免是一個遺憾。但作者對於鄭成功尙無過分侮蔑之處，有人還說作者「寓悲觀之微意」，這是稍足安慰的。</p>
<h3>檢閱</h3>
<p>— 蘇更</p>
<p>—後方散記之二—</p>
<p>昨天晚上，接到司令部的電話，說是某總指揮今天親臨C城，檢閱金縣的民裝隊伍，所以今天弟兄們起身得特別早。</p>
<p>剛吹過起身號，弟兄們就一鵑落的爬了起來。每個人都有一些睡意的揉揉着眼睛，穿上了衣服，打好了綳腿，之後，大家就忙亂的整理着內務，摺好軍氈，舖好蓆子，每個人都奔來奔去的，整個的部隊給圍在忙碌的氣氛中，每個人的臉上都浮現着一種稀有的嚴肅表情。</p>
<p>時鐘剛敲打過七下，全大隊的弟兄們就都武裝了起來，接着在檢査了一陣之後，就開到距離隊部有一二里路的公路上，全隊都排列在公路上。</p>
<p>在公路旁擺攤的小販王三子，被派出去維持秩序的乒士們轟走了，他把他的小販攤擺到遠遠的陳壯去的路口的空地上，呆呆的望着這邊的公路上的許多人，臉上露着奇怪的表情，是的，他還不知兵士們不肯讓他在公路旁擺攤，把他轟到這路口的原因，而且今天在公路上突然出現了這許多佩帶槍械的人的這件奇特的事，也使他感到莫明其妙，但是他憑着他的「聰明」和過去的經驗，他判定一定是什麽大官來了……</p>
<p>八點鐘還沒有到，一條長長的公路上已經站滿了武裝的兵士，噪囂的說話聲，時時盪漾在冬天早晨的太陽光下，初冬的陽光，透着金黄色的光絲，和煖的照着人們，人們在太陽金黄色的光絲下熱烈的蠢動着。</p>
<p>第二大隊全體的弟兄都集中在公路上，等候着某總指揮的檢閱，州是時間等得久了，弟兄們心裏也就焦燥起來了，嚴肅的氣氛開始變爲輕鬆的談話！</p>
<p>「喂，老胡。怎麽還沒有來呢」？是謝海山的問話，</p>
<p>「唔，快了吧，不要心焦，站在謝海山的前排的老胡望了前面的公路一下不經意，的答他。</p>
<p>公路上，人更多了，各種的武裝隊伍都集中在這裏，担架隊也全部出發。</p>
<p>一隊穿着便衣，每人都肩着一支鋤頭，鐵耙，洋鐵鍫的破壞隊，浩浩盪盪的開了過來，每個人都戴着一頂笠子，粗糙樸素的臉孔，帶着稍微有些慌張的表情，引得兄弟們哄然笑了起來。站在老胡背後的謝海山笑着說</p>
<p>「他們來幹嗎的呢？叫他們到前綫上去種田的嗎？」</p>
<p>「老百姓呵！老百姓的破…破壞隊呢！」</p>
<p>「破壞什麽呢？」謝海山望着他們的後影說。</p>
<p>「破……破壞公路呵！日本鬼子來了就破壞公路。」老胡是比較的明白的，他知道老百姓們力量，所以他不懷疑破壞隊的力量，但是他不明自破壞隊的作用，所以他只得拿前天吳隊長吿訴他的話囘答謝海山了。</p>
<p>突然的，前頭的炮串打起來了，接着軍樂聲也響起來了，隊伍中低低的傳送着總指揮來了的消息，於是兄弟們鬆懈了的心又緊張起來了，噪意的談話聲立時爲嚴肅的氣氛所代替了</p>
<p>總指揮到了車站，下了自備汽車，和歡迎的官員們慢慢的走過來，軍樂隨在他們的背後，悠然的吹奏着。弟兄們都挺直的站着，嚴肅的氣氛籠罩住整個的週遭，隊伍中死寂的，只是響着弟兄們心事的狂跳聲。</p>
<p>太陽正掛在天空，空際上正飄着太陽的金絲，總指揮被迎到司令部去了，檢閱也就結束了，弟兄們懷着興奮而疲懈了的心，走囘隊部來，那一隊破壞隊，也各各的載上了他們的笠子，肩看鋤頭，鐵把，洋鐵鍬，走回他們的老家去。</p>
<p>一九三九，一，十六，於八區司令部</p>
<h3>廢墟與砲煙</h3>
<p>— 尾崎士郞作　林煥平譯</p>
<p>一入鄱陽湖，水色就在看着看着之中變了。我們沒有看到澄淸的水色已過了多少天了呢。氣温又熱，只是看着呆然伸瀉的長江之流水，心頭苦極了。</p>
<p>但是，在這裏有映在水裏的雲影。我舉頭望着夭空。光輝的雲線。像今天這樣美，簡直沒有過。氣温也並非是突然下降，然而映入眼簾的自然之風物，却充滿着像是第一次看見似的新鮮豪爽，隨處都看到。我的胸懷洋溢起「剪不斷，理還亂」的鄕愁來了。在湖口，有海軍楊子江艦隊的司令部。如果說安慶是溯航戰的第一個立脚點，則湖口可以說是迫九江的第二個立脚點了。跟着港之次第地接近着來，市街的古色古香，也沁滲似地浮現起來了，深深的斷崖，城壁似地包圍着市街，岩蔭下看到的赤塔的顏色，在陽光之下眩目地輝耀着。不可思議的事情，恐怕就是比到如今通過的揚子江沿岸任何城都古舊，是任誰人一看以明都可白這件事情吧。我們一到碇泊地司令部，馬上就由井上大佐領導，去巡視了市街一週。聳立在左手邊的尖峭的岩山，是有名的石鐘山。國民政府似乎拚命的把它葬成軍事要地。從前中國海軍的司令部就在那裏。小小的港口堆滿着小船。穿着一件緊身衣的士兵，在上落着貨物，井上大佐指着他們說：</p>
<p>「那不是召集來的士兵，是應募而來的船夫。」</p>
<p>這樣說起來，全體之動不知不覺是自由地伸展着似的。動作上即或有不中用之處吧，心情上却是好的。自然地產生的統制，使一舉手一投足，都有生存之益處，我這樣感覺到了。日本軍登陸了的時候，市內的住民像各處一樣，都逃走光了，到過了快一個月的今日，也沒有看出將要囘來的樣子。剩下來的，只有石鐘山的廟主和一個帶着小孩子的老娣人。說什麽都是言語不通；弄東西給他也不肯吃。廟主虔誠地抱着小小的佛像，日夜地膜拜着。恐怕是吃草根之類的東西吧。怎機地交替着人員，交替着東西，企圖接近他們，他們也絲毫都不接受我們的好意，所以現在，索性不理他們了。</p>
<p>年紀已經過了五十，長着美麗的半白的口髭井上大佐這麽對我說？</p>
<p>「那麽，不是間諜嗎」？我問。</p>
<p>「——開始的時候也這樣警戒着：但是，也並沒有發見其間牒的樣子，我覺得，恐怕還是當長期間的信仰，（——指抗日的信仰——譯者）所堅固着他們的意志吧。」</p>
<p>這個老婦人住在廢墟似的市中，此外，只有牧師的家族，遺留在法國的敎會裏。除了担任警備的軍隊外，還有在軍隊裏使用的二百多人的苦力，雖以軍用票支付工錢，但因爲沒有住民，無法使用。至說到軍隊以外的日本人，只有一對四五天前才從內地來的經營照相業的夫婦。年靑的夫婦感情似乎非常好。一看有闊達野人似的相貌的浮田中尉哈哈地笑着這麽說：</p>
<p>「以軍隊爲對象，恐怕做不了什麽生意吧。總之，是煩惱的——看到朝寢着的，也是小心翼翼，在夜裏呢，是怎麽着呢？也是小心翼翼的。」　（未完）</p>

<h3>Repelling the Japanese ×'s Political Offensive</h3>
<p>Japan's invasion of our country has encountered difficulties in its military progress. Consequently, it has had to resort to political conspiracies to orchestrate peace, attempting to divide our country's anti-Japanese front and weaken our resistance. The goal is to end the war on conditions of victory. This would not only allow them to digest the benefits they have already gained, but also dismantle our country's unity, returning our internal affairs to the state of division before the war. This would then provide them the opportunity to engage in further aggression. Though this conspiracy has been repeatedly shattered by our country's strong anti-Japanese front, it has not only persisted to this day, but has intensified proportionally to the increasing difficulty of Japan's military progress.</p>
<p>Since the anti-Japanese war entered its second phase, Japan's military operations in China have not only made no progress, but have become increasingly bogged down. To attack the Northwest, they were defeated once in Western Shanxi and again in Southern Shanxi, their attempts to cross the river becoming mere pipe dreams. To open the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, they have been stalled in both the north on the border of Hunan and Hubei, and in the south at Huaxian Xin Street. To attack the Southwest, they have been unable to cross Beihai and Sanshui. Meanwhile, in various guerrilla zones, our guerrilla forces are exceptionally active, launching attacks at any time and any place, leaving them exhausted from responding and in a dilemma between advancing and retreating. Moreover, since the start of the war, Japan's domestic finances have been drained, with runaway inflation, soaring prices, and widespread suffering. Anti-war sentiment is rising, with many university professors arrested for opposing the war. The Communist Party has also launched large-scale anti-war movements among the people of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. These facts have made Japan's rulers acutely aware of the disadvantages of a protracted war with China. They have thus resorted to orchestrating peace as a way to survive in a dead end. On the one hand, they took advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of North China, using the names of North China mass organizations and non-official celebrities to issue telegrams calling for peace. On the other hand, they used the "Axis of Germany and Italy" to send Matsuda, a member of the House of Peers, and Kurazono, a member of the House of Representatives, to China to approach the Italian ambassador to China, asking him to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, Germany, eager for Japan to achieve victory in China, spread the smokescreen of "German-Soviet amity" and the impending demise of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" in Chongqing, attempting to sow discord between Chinese-Soviet friendship and relax our country's resistance efforts.</p>
<p>The reason Japan wants to take advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of North China, using fabricated names to telegraph for peace, is not only to divide our country's anti-Japanese front, but also to try to change the perceptions of third countries towards China's resistance. This is because Britain has recently taken a more active stance on our country's resistance. It has not only been consistent with the United States and France in protesting Japan's violation of international treaties and the forceful occupation of foreign interests in China, but has also provided loans to our country for economic assistance, dealing a considerable blow to Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, it has had to fabricate facts to confuse public opinion, hoping to reduce British sympathy and assistance to our country. However, the people of North China are well aware of its treacherous schemes. In addition to sending telegrams to the whole country to reveal its conspiracies, they also sent letters when the British ambassador arrived in Tianjin, declaring their unwavering support for the National Government's resistance to the end and that they have no absurd illusions of calling for peace, in order to dispel falsehoods and correct public perception. As for its conspiracy to use the "German-Italian route" to lure a few wavering elements in the anti-Japanese front who do not understand the great cause and disregard the facts to divide our country's unity, thereby making it impossible to continue the resistance, it is also a fruitless endeavor with no effect. This is because after Wang Jingwei and others ××, those who advocate the "German-Italian route" have temporarily disappeared from sight, not daring to show their faces.</p>
<p>For nineteen months, the hard sacrifices of our people have made it clear to the entire nation that to achieve national liberation, we can only achieve our goal by uniting and resisting until the end. Our country is fundamentally an oppressed and invaded nation. This resistance is entirely out of unbearable oppression and aggression, and we have risen up to defend ourselves. It is also for the sake of national survival and national liberation that we have made a great and painful decision and embarked on the path of resistance. War is self-defense, and not fighting is surrender, is submission, is leading oneself to destruction! Now, the prospect of our country's victory is becoming brighter day by day. Building a mountain requires nine trips filling baskets with dirt. How can we be willing to stop short of success? We deeply hope that all Chinese citizens will develop a spirit of hard and unyielding struggle, and promote and assist the government. Domestically, we must step up the political mobilization work of unity and cooperation among all anti-Japanese parties and groups, accelerate the improvement and progress of political, military, party affairs, and people's movements, and intensify economic construction in the rear and the rear's × combat force. Externally, we must thoroughly eliminate the "German-Italian route" of capitulationists, strengthen the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and strive to win more practical and extensive assistance from the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France. Only by doubling our efforts to apply these principles of internal and external struggle to repel the Japanese ×'s political offensive can we ultimately and most thoroughly defeat the × invaders!</p>
<h3>The Youth National Salvation Movement in Chaoshan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenqiang</p>
<p>Recognizing the severity of the national crisis and unwilling to be slaves of a fallen nation, the youth of Chaoshan launched a national salvation movement among the people of Chaoshan even before the July 7th Incident. Because the government's national policy of resistance had not yet been decided, the political environment did not allow the vigorous development of the people's national salvation movement. The activities of the youth in Chaoshan appeared in a vague and obscure manner. Many youth groups, such as the Shantou New Script Research Association, the Esperanto Society, the Hai Chao Drama Society, the Literary Symposium, and the current affairs discussion groups of various school groups, all aimed to unite youth, train youth, educate the people, awaken the people, and prepare them to shoulder the arduous task of saving the country when the great era arrived. When the Shantou Hai Chao Drama Society was preparing to organize, regarding the issue of the name, someone proposed "National Defense Drama Society." At that time, everyone thought that the meaning of the two words "national defense" could best express the content of the work and was the best possible name. However, the environment did not allow us to talk about national defense. What we feared was that people would know too much that we were doing national salvation work, so everyone agreed to adopt a more neutral name. The decision of a drama society's name may be a small matter, but it fully illustrates how the youth of Chaoshan at that time were working hard in a difficult environment to promote the national salvation movement. After about a year of silent growth, the national salvation movement of the youth of Chaoshan had laid a fairly solid foundation.</p>
<p>Before the war of resistance, the national salvation organizations of the youth of Chaoshan all died young due to the oppression of the harsh environment. However, the youth of Chaoshan constantly innovated, and after one organization disintegrated, another new organization emerged. After the Xi'an Incident, Chinese politics began to improve, and youth activities were relatively free. Therefore, the Literary Symposium, which began to be organized in the spring of 1937, still existed when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred and continued to develop. After the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the Literary Symposium immediately expanded and transformed into the Shantou Youth National Salvation Comrades Association—later renamed the Youth Anti-× Comrades Association—becoming the core of the vigorous youth national salvation movement in Chaoshan since the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The Chaoshan youth national salvation movement is the backbone and essence of the entire Chaoshan people's national salvation movement. The scope of activities of the youth of Chaoshan is not limited to Chaoshan. In the northwest, southeast, and various battlefields, there are heroic youth from Chaoshan studying and fighting. The Chaoshan Youth National Salvation Movement deserves attention!</p>
<p>Widespread Expansion and Unification of Organizations</p>
<p>The Shantou Youth National Salvation Association was established not long after the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred. The anger of national hatred that had been brewing in the hearts of general zealous youth since the September 18th Incident for six years seemed to have obtained sufficient nourishment. It immediately ignited a strong flame, and all gathered under the flag of the Youth National Salvation Association, working hard and loudly calling for action, setting off a climax of the Shantou Youth National Salvation Movement.</p>
<p>Shantou is the center of Chaoshan's economy and culture. Any social movement that occurs in Shantou will have a leading and driving effect on the entire Chaoshan region. The climax of the Shantou Youth National Salvation Movement quickly spread to the entire Chaoshan region. The organizations of the Youth National Salvation Comrades Association were established in various counties in a short period of time. Now, the organizations of the Youth Anti-× Association are widespread in counties, districts, townships, and towns. The youth of Chaoshan have already been organized.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war of resistance, only a small number of youth with a relatively high degree of political awareness and a relatively strong patriotic enthusiasm participated in the Chaoshan youth anti-enemy organizations. The members of the Youth National Salvation Associations in each county and city numbered only forty or fifty, and at most two hundred. The total number in Chaoshan was less than three thousand. Although they were all youth with a considerable level of knowledge and a considerable level of working ability, and their performance was also quite good, and they promoted the people's national salvation movement to a considerable extent; however, there were still many youth wandering outside the national salvation circle, unable to follow the ranks of advanced youth, and move together towards the great road of national liberation, which inevitably buried the precious youth power, and was a shortcoming in the Youth National Salvation Movement. Filling this shortcoming is the urgent task of the advancing national salvation youth.</p>
<p>When the flames of the war of resistance resounded throughout the country, why couldn't the youth of Chaoshan on the national defense front unite together to prepare to repel the approaching × invaders? Subjectively, it was because the style of the advanced youth made mistakes and did not pay attention to attracting backward youth... Objectively, it was because the environment had not yet improved greatly, and the evil forces hindering youth activities still existed.</p>
<p>After the shortcomings were exposed by the facts, everyone felt that they should be overcome immediately. The youth of Chaoshan had a shortcoming in the past, that is, their attitude to work was too advanced. Not only did it make it impossible for peasant and worker youth to approach, but also most of the intellectual youth with slightly weaker enthusiasm, because they did not receive the power of attraction, thought that they could not keep up with others, and did not want to keep up with others, and stayed outside the national salvation circle. A part of the advanced and enthusiastic youth, like a locomotive that had derailed from the train, moved forward by leaps and bounds. Although its speed was fast, its effect was small. However, it also seemed like a commando team that had broken away from the main force. The more it rushed into the × formation, the more it felt the isolation of its strength. It could not help but slow down slightly. Only by cooperating with the broad team can it overcome the current great ×. When the Youth Anti-× Associations in various places in Chaoshan held a representative conference last August 13th, reviewing the members of their own teams, they were only a part of the advanced intellectual youth. The vast majority of young people had not yet joined the ranks of national salvation, and they deeply felt that they were in a dangerous situation of fighting alone. Therefore, they immediately decided to attract the vast masses of youth and expand the organization of the association as an important task for future work. After August 13th, the Youth Anti-× Associations in various places in Chaoshan were working hard to expand the organization of the association. Although the objective environment had only made some progress, and the forces hindering the youth movement still existed, after the subjective weaknesses were considerably overcome. The ranks of national salvation youth have already been rapidly expanded. The Shantou Youth Anti-× Association has grown from 200 to 600 members, and the number of members of the Youth Anti-× Association in Chaoshan has surged to over 15,000.</p>
<p>In the war of resistance, the responsibility of the youth is not only to enthusiastically shoulder the anti-war work of various departments, but also to mobilize tens of millions of peasant and worker masses to bravely rush to the battlefield of national liberation. Although the ranks of the Chaoshan national salvation youth are gradually becoming broader and stronger, the vast peasant and worker masses, who are the basic force for protracted resistance, have not yet been mobilized. It has only done the work of enriching its own strength, and it is still quite far from the true goal of the national salvation movement—arousing the broad masses. Therefore, expanding the organization to factories and fields, and closely linking youth with the peasant and worker masses has become the current working policy of the Chaoshan youth to expand the organization.</p>
<p>The organization of the Chaoshan youth national salvation organizations was very scattered and unsystematic at the beginning. There was no unified leading agency above the counties and cities. Within a county. The County Youth Anti-× Association was not connected to the District Youth Anti-× Association, and the District Youth Anti-× Association was not connected to the Township Youth Anti-× Association. Each Youth Anti-× Association was an independent unit, only subordinate to the local People's Anti-× Support Association, and slowly under the leadership of the Support Association. Therefore, the comrades of the Youth Anti-× Associations in various places were fighting alone. There was only spiritual connection between each other, not organizational connection, and only spiritual leadership, not organizational leadership. The Shantou Youth Anti-× Association, whose work performance was relatively good, has invisibly become the leading agency of the Chaoshan Youth National Salvation Movement. However, this leadership is unsound. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Most of the Yarn Factories in the Occupied Areas Have Been Robbed by ×, and the Distribution and Sale of Yarn and Cloth in the Area Is Also Monopolized, Resulting in Huge Losses to the Coastal Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] Chinese yarn factories are mostly concentrated in a few coastal cities and have suffered the most from the impact of the war. The factories in the war zones have been robbed for refusing to cooperate, and machinery and equipment have been moved without permission. The goods produced by Chinese factories in the concessions rely entirely on consumption in the southwestern provinces. The sale of yarn in the Japanese-occupied areas is monopolized by the Japanese, and cotton is also subject to unified distribution and sale. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Thirty-Eight Yarn Factories in Operation</p>
<p>Yarn factories in operation in Shanghai: (1) Chinese: Shenxin No. 2 Textile Factory, Shenxin No. 9 Textile Factory, Xinyu No. 1 Factory, Xinyu No. 2 Factory, Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Factory, Yong'an No. 3 Factory, Tongyi Textile Company, Qinfeng Textile Factory, Datong Yarn Factory Limited Company, Heji Zhenye Yarn Factory, totaling 12 factories with 354,272 spindles, 31,360 thread spindles, and 1,700 cloth looms, accounting for 32.3% of the original yarn factories. (2) British: Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Yangshupu, Lun Chang, etc., 4 factories with 4,976 spindles, 3,640 thread spindles, and 3,265 cloth looms. (3) Japanese: Nichiwa, Shanghai, Naigaimen, Donghua, Tongxing, Gongda, Dakang, Toyota, Yufeng, etc., 24 factories with 1,114,316 spindles, 290,824 thread spindles, and 14,554 cloth looms.</p>
<p>Consumption of Chinese, British, and Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>The goods produced by Chinese, British, and Japanese factories are entirely dependent on consumption in the southwestern provinces for the Chinese factories. The British factories supply their own weaving factories in Shanghai. Japanese yarn is priced lower than Chinese and British yarn and is supplied to various weaving factories in Shanghai for sale in the occupied areas. The transaction volume of spot yarn in Shanghai in November last year was 2,050 bales to Yunnan, 1,994 bales to the inland, 1,586 bales to Shantou, 1,315 bales to Dalian, 219 bales to Ningbo, 350 bales to the Northern Gang, 394 bales to Fujian, 80 bales to Wenzhou, 52 bales to Quanzhou, 40 bales to Yantai, 40 bales to Sichuan, 85 bales to Jiangxi, 25 bales to Southeast Asia, 35 bales to Haiphong, 6,208 bales to the Four Banks, 10 bales to Luzhou, totaling 14,483 bales.</p>
<p>Raw Material Control and Soaring Prices</p>
<p>The raw material for yarn factories is cotton, which is usually purchased from the cotton-producing areas of Jiangbei and North China. Now, because the above-mentioned areas have fallen into enemy hands one after another, the puppet "North China Provisional Government" and the puppet "Central China Reformed Government" have been ordered by the Japanese to implement unified control over the distribution and sale of cotton. Therefore, the raw materials required by Chinese yarn factories are quite difficult to obtain. Although the cotton harvest in various places last year was abundant, it was all controlled by the Japanese and transported to Japan and the leased territories of Kwantung, Korea, and Taiwan, etc., with a total value of approximately 89,897,717 yuan in national currency. The price of cotton, such as the average price of Huoji cotton in November last year, was 52 yuan 89 cents, the average price of Lingbao cotton was 84 yuan 5 cents, and the average price of Tianjin American cotton was 88 yuan 11 cents. The prices of the above three types of cotton are the highest since 1932.</p>
<p>Robbery of Chinese Yarn Factories in the War Zone</p>
<p>The Japanese sought to seize the Chinese yarn factories in the occupied areas, and designated Japanese manufacturers such as Naigaimen, Shanghai, Nichiwa, Tongxing, and Gongda within the Textile Industry Association in Shanghai to take over the Chinese factories, nominally for cooperation, in an attempt to rob them. Because the terms were too harsh, the factories refused to cooperate unanimously. The Japanese plan failed and they simply robbed the machinery and equipment of the factories and moved them elsewhere as their own. For example, most of the Chinese factories in the war zone on the outskirts of Shanghai have been destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that have been spared have had their internal machinery and equipment removed, making it impossible to restore them for the time being. In total, 21 factories, including Hengfeng, Dafeng, Zhentai, Baoxing, and Shanghai, have 760,136 spindles, 91,306 thread spindles, and 24,919 looms, accounting for 67.7% of the original yarn factories.</p>

<h3>British Various Parties Consider Economic Aid to China Banking Circles Study Appropriate Methods Chinese Customs Guaranteed Bonds Rise</h3>
<p>【Reuters, London, Day】The news of China's payment of the March interest on the 1898 loan was greatly appreciated here. Customs loans have risen by more than half a point. It is generally believed that China will still agree to continue paying customs loans, but this issue is closely linked to further economic assistance. Currently, various parties have different observations on China's needs. Some advocate providing assistance to the construction of southwestern provinces in China through credit, while others advocate supporting China's gold through real loans. The difficulty of the latter is natural. It is reported that Mr. Rogers of the Bank of England is now responsible for considering appropriate methods. General sympathy towards China is a fact, so it is believed that the extent of economic aid to China will definitely be completed based on general intentions.</p>

After protests from the central government, the two ships were released separately last night and this morning. The ship's navigation licenses are currently being checked by the British consulate in Yantai.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Shanghai, 8th】At today's Japanese military press briefing here, reporter Gu asked about the detention of foreign ships, saying that if foreign ships have licenses from the National Government, such as Jardine Matheson's Minsheng and Taisheng, why should they still be checked? A Japanese naval spokesperson said that the Japanese military must check the licenses and other documents from the puppet affairs office, and as for whether this action is legal, the spokesperson actually said, "The actions of the Japanese military are to warn the Jiang government, and we will continue the war to the end and take all necessary actions to achieve the goal of overthrowing the Jiang government."</p>

<h3>Soviet Far East Army Actively Prepares for War Rumors of Siberian Railway Extending into Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>【Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th】The Japanese Diet decided to request the government to do its best to maintain the fishing rights of Japanese people in the Soviet territorial waters of the Far East under any circumstances. It is also heard that a military meeting was held in Vladivostok, presided over by the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Far East Fleet.

<h3>Japan's Second Half-Year Budget Plan Army and Navy Disputes Fiercely Supplementary Budget to be Submitted to the Diet Mid-Month Totaling Over 6 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>【Downing Street, Tokyo, 8th】Japan's next fiscal year will begin on April 1st. The supplementary budget bill for the army and navy this year will be submitted to the Diet in mid-month, totaling over 6 billion yen, equivalent to about 35 million pounds. The total army military expenditure is about 5.4 billion yen (i.e., 32 million pounds), including the army's regular expenses, special expenses, and emergency expenses. This figure was drafted by the Ministry of the Army and has recently been sent to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>Army Based on Two-Power Standard</p>
<p>This year's total army military expenditure is 5.4 billion yen (i.e., 22.5 million pounds). Next year's army budget plan is based on a "two-power standard" to enable Japan to simultaneously cope with China and the Soviet Union, maintain the strength of the Japanese army in China, increase the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo," strengthen the air force, and adjust the supply of military supplies. This large army budget plan will inevitably be reduced somewhat by the Ministry of Finance, but not below 5 billion.</p>
<p>Navy Aims to Compete with Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy has not yet released its request, but Navy Minister Yonai recently declared that Japan must implement a plan to control the seas and compete with the naval construction plans of Britain and the United States. It is rumored that the army and navy are in fierce dispute, because the army's request for budget funds is extremely large, which affects the navy's development. In previous years, the budget funds of the Japanese army and navy were increased in a balanced manner, but now the army must request huge funds to cope with the "China Incident," which has affected the navy's funds and must be reduced somewhat.</p>
<p>Special Budget Figures are Astonishing</p>
<p>The Navy's budget for the next fiscal year is 653 million yen (3.8 million British pounds), which is 270 million yen less than this year's naval expenditure, because the expenses incurred by the Navy in China are paid from the special budget. It is reported that the Navy's special budget is about 1.2 billion yen (70 million), so the total Navy budget for the next fiscal year will reach 1.85 billion yen (about 11 million pounds). Based on these figures, it is estimated that the total budget of the Japanese army and navy for the next fiscal year will reach 7.35 billion yen (400 million and 30 million).</p>
<p>Navy Minister Yonai Responds to Questions</p>
<p>【Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th】Navy Minister Yonai declared to the Diet that Japan does not need to establish naval bases on the coast of China again and the government is unwilling to do so. A member asked him whether Japan would sign a military agreement with China after the Sino-Japanese War. The Navy Minister replied that this is what Japan wants most and it will greatly help the establishment of a new order in East Asia. However, it is still impossible to predict how future events will develop.</p>

<h3>Last Year's National Tea Exports Broke Records Totaling Over 25 Million Expected to Increase Again This Year</h3>
<p>【Kunming Newsletter】Tea is a special product of our country, and foreign trade accounts for an important sales channel. In the past, Shanghai was the main export station, resold to various countries in Europe and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, tea-producing areas in eastern China have been ravaged by ×, and exports have been greatly affected. Therefore, the China Tea Company specially came to Yunnan to open another tea factory for large-scale production. According to what is known, the current tea export total has been transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Before the Guangzhou un-ceded guerrilla area, all the tea in central China, such as Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, was transferred to Hong Kong via the Yuehan Road for export. Since the retreat from Guangzhou, this road is impassable. Currently, most of the national tea is transported from various provinces in the mainland to Yunnan Province, then transported to Hong Kong via Hanoi, or directly to Yangon from this province. According to the survey, the production of national tea has not decreased in the past year. More than 590,000 boxes were transported from Guilin and Yunnan to Hong Kong for transshipment and export, which can be sold for more than 25 million national currency. Moreover, exports of green tea have also increased to 250,000 boxes, while in previous years it was only 200,000 boxes. In addition, 120,000 boxes of Qimen black tea have been shipped out in the past ten months, while in previous years it was only 70,000 to 80,000 boxes. In total, last year's export tea in our country has broken all previous records. It is expected that after Yunnan expands its tea factories this year, sales will definitely increase more than last year.</p>
<h3>Kunming Cultural Trends</h3>
<p>— Four Dreams</p>
<p>(IV) Theater Troupe, Punishment Object</p>
<p>Following the development of the War of Resistance, theater troupes in Kunming also sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The first one established was the Jinma Drama Society, which was organized by local youths who loved drama. The society's address was in the Public Education Center, and it has performed no less than a dozen times. The scripts were all highly inflammatory works, such as "Night Light Cup" and "Black Hell", which have won some good reviews. Not long ago, the Shanghai Film Troupe also came from Sichuan. People were shocked by the names of the stars, and the appeal was not small. They performed for more than a month, including "Night Light Cup", "Thunderstorm", and "Sunrise", all of which were progressive works. In addition, the performance was exquisite and realistic, which was really an invigorating agent for the culturally backward Kunming. In addition, many schools organized theater troupes, including the Southwest Associated University Drama Troupe and the Yunnan University Drama Troupe. Two months ago, they had a cold clothing performance to raise money for cold clothing and propaganda, and the results were very good. In the culturally backward Yunnan,</p>
<p>It is already very difficult to have these theater troupes working hard, and they are still growing, so the future achievements are unlimited.</p>
<p>There are many publications in Kunming, including New Trends, Today's Review, South, Wartime Knowledge, New Yunnan, Youth Public Opinion, Cultural Post, Southwest Frontier, etc. Some are dedicated to current affairs, and some are pure literature and art.</p>
<p>"Today's Review" and "New Yunnan" are the most recently published. The editor of "Today's Review" is Professor Qian Duansheng of Southwest Associated University. Most of the articles are written by professors from the Associated University, and the sales are quite good, a bit like the past "Independent Review". The creation issue of "New Yunnan" sold a lot of copies after publication, with articles by Mu Muda, Ma Zihua, etc. This publication has a lot of potential for development in the future.</p>
<p>From all aspects, Kunming's culture is indeed starting to leap forward.</p>

Now the traces of the × pseudo have disappeared in Xiao-Pei counties, and Fengxian city has been captured and abandoned several times. The × are trapped in the city and dare not leave the city. The suburbs of Xuzhou city are ten miles away from the activity area of ​​our guerrillas. Currently, the anti-Japanese forces in the counties are scattered in various villages, organizing farmers, and attacking the × from time to time. Puppet organizations automatically disband, traitors have turned against them, the rich donate food to help the army, and the poor are eager to serve.

<h3>Glorious Attack on Hu Town</h3>
<p>— By Bai Wei</p>
<p>— Travel Notes from Returning to Hui, Part Seven —</p>
<p>Arriving at Hu Town, the reporter couldn't help but think of the glorious attack on Hu Town. So, I immediately visited the old hero Hu Zhunan, who assisted in the battle. Fortunately, I met him at a shop in Jili. Old hero Hu is already over seventy years old, but his piercing eyes and grizzled iron beard still retain the spirit of a young man. After paying my respects, I sat beside the roaring fire and listened to old hero Hu recount the glorious battle.</p>
<p>"It was in early December, when the × people started to withdraw, with vehicles passing by continuously," old hero Hu began briskly.</p>
<p>"At the time, Battalion Commander Lian Shuying of the 157th Division, who was stationed near Hu Town and responsible for guerrilla warfare, decided to launch a surprise attack and discussed the plan with me. We decided that his battalion would be divided into three groups, ambushing in the mountain ravine two or three miles below Xiangang Bridge, while I would cover the rear."</p>
<p>"Sure enough, we hadn't been ambushed for long when the × people's vehicles came in formation. We waited until more than ten vehicles at the front of the × convoy had passed, and then the central group immediately launched a sweeping attack, overturning four vehicles on the spot. The left and right groups also sprang into action. When the × people saw the ambush, they immediately stopped all the vehicles and lined them up within the firing range of our central group, totaling over a hundred vehicles. Under our intensive fire, another eight vehicles were overturned. The × soldiers inside the vehicles scattered like birds and beasts. Later investigations revealed that about a hundred were killed. The troops on our left and right wings, seeing the central group firing so enthusiastically, actually abandoned their guard duties and ran to the central group to fire as well. The × people then dispatched about a thousand soldiers from the front and rear vehicles, dividing them into two groups to encircle us. Our entire army unknowingly fell into the × people's encirclement."</p>
<p>In this situation, the reporter couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat for our brave troops. But old hero Hu continued calmly:</p>
<p>"Fortunately, I led eighty or ninety local men to scout on the mountain behind. Seeing the × soldiers spreading across the mountains in separate groups, I rushed to the rescue from a small path behind the mountain, leading the troops that were in operation to break out of the × people's encirclement via a small path."</p>
<p>"Then our troops didn't suffer much loss, right?" Although the reporter's heart was much relieved, I couldn't help but worry.</p>
<p>"Loss? The loss was very small. Two brothers were injured, and a squad leader named Chen died in battle!"</p>
<p>Mentioning squad leader Chen, the old hero's tone became somewhat choked. He said, "Squad leader Chen was truly a great warrior of the Chinese nation. Initially, he was in the central group, holding a light machine gun and taking the lead, strafing the × vehicles. Later, he felt that strafing was less effective than direct fire, so he crawled forward and faced the embankment of the road, aiming the machine gun at the front of the vehicles, so that the bullets entered straight through the front, pierced through the interior, and entered the neighboring vehicle. In the cacophony of gunfire, I don't know how many × soldiers' lives were taken. After shooting for about ten minutes, the × people discovered his position. In the concentrated counterattack of several × machine guns, he suffered several serious injuries to his legs. But this still doesn't show the greatness of squad leader Chen; there was an even greater deed later!"</p>
<p>"At that time, Battalion Commander Lian heard that his machine gun was silent and knew he must be injured, so he called several brothers to risk their lives to rescue him and carry him to the rear. But he said to those who rescued him, 'Brothers, I'm finished now. Carrying me back is useless. You can take this machine gun back, uncover the lids of two hand grenades and give them to me, so that I can exchange my dying life for a few more × people!' Those brothers asked him several times to go back to the rear, but he refused. So, they gave him two hand grenades and left with tears in their eyes. The next day, after the × people retreated, we went to find his remains. Although his remains were bloody and unrecognizable after being blown apart by shrapnel, there were two large patches of blood on the grass near his body. Sir, isn't this great deed 'startling to heaven and earth, and moving to ghosts and gods'? So, we chose a site on the mountain beside Xianggong Bridge that day and buried him publicly."</p>
<p>"The green hills are fortunate to bury loyal bones." I think squad leader Chen's heroism not only makes the green hills magnificent but also makes the mountains and rivers magnificent.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister's Declaration Unanimously Approved by Parliament Adequate Response to US Stance Definite Warning to Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The British House of Commons adjourned early yesterday, and it was impossible to fully express opinions on Chamberlain's declaration of British-French solidarity in the National Assembly of Political Affairs. Today, the opinions of the members of the National Assembly have become clear. Judging from the speeches made by representatives of various parties, Chamberlain's declaration has been widely approved. Opinions from all parties are generally as follows: In view of the fact that some countries still have doubts about Britain's attitude towards France in the current situation, Chamberlain had no choice but to issue this declaration on Monday. Some people even believe that this declaration should have been issued months ago. The attitude of the United States has become increasingly clear recently. Members of parliament believe that Chamberlain's move is adequate to respond to it. The opposition Labor Party even asked the government to take further steps to promote cooperation between all democratic countries, especially the United States. All parties expressed satisfaction with the UK's current guarantee. Strengthening relations with France is considered an inevitable result. Members of parliament opposed to the government had previously severely criticized government policies, but they unanimously approved this declaration. Furthermore, the most sufficient proof that the declaration has achieved good results in Congress is that the opposition has decided to temporarily cease opposition. They have also been working hard to promote the government's recent declarations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons, stating that Britain would assist France in the event of war in the future. U.S. diplomatic circles expressed deep satisfaction upon hearing this, and said that the British government authorities have never made such definite statements regarding the British-French alliance. Therefore, if France were to be attacked in the future, Britain's attitude is now clear. These people also believe that this is the most definite warning to German Head of State Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and it is sufficient to strengthen the similar warning issued by President Roosevelt last week. Generally speaking, the London side has already received reports that Germany is preparing to threaten Western Europe before advancing eastward. Chamberlain issued a firm statement in order to strike first, which, in short, greatly satisfies the alliance between Britain and France. It is believed that this move not only strengthens the power of the British and French governments, but also serves as the most important factor in maintaining peace in Europe.</p>
<h3>Bonnet's Speech France's International Relations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered a speech in the House of Representatives today on France's international relations, saying that in recent weeks, France has maintained close contact with the U.S. government, and the U.S. government understands France very well. He said, "The three major democratic countries are extremely clear about their material and spiritual strength. They know their position on Earth and in history and their economic power, and they also know that no country can force them into a certain political system. However, the friendship between these democratic countries does not harm anyone, nor does it want to harm anyone. What they demand is peace and development for these three major countries." "No country, large or small, needs to think that these three major countries will be their enemies." Referring to Hitler's speech on January 30, in which he said that Germany does not want to export National Socialism, Bonnet said, "We can also make the same guarantee. Democratic countries do not want to engage in external propaganda, let alone external aggression." Bonnet also said that he has worked hard to eliminate misunderstandings between France and Italy and believes that the goodwill between the peoples of the two countries is sufficient to arouse friendship between the two countries. "I cannot imagine that Italy will invade France. I really cannot imagine that France and Italy are connected by blood, language, and culture." He also solemnly stated that the French government will not allow any other government to endanger the integrity of Spain. Italy has assured Britain that it has no territorial ambitions in Spain. What France hopes for is the fulfillment of this promise. He then mentioned that in the past few weeks, rumors spread that the solidarity between Britain and France was not very strong, saying, "I have already had this question answered by Mr. Chamberlain, the most loyal and great friend of our country." Bonnet then quoted Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons amid enthusiastic applause from the audience and said, "Gentlemen, you must understand the full meaning of this declaration." After Bonnet finished his speech, members of parliament from all parties, except the Socialist Party, applauded unanimously.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] "The News Chronicle" wrote today, "Chamberlain's words are extremely important and clear, and it is unlikely that they will be misunderstood by any foreign country. The solidarity among democratic countries is gradually increasing, and President Roosevelt has provided good leadership."</p>

<h3>US Anti-War President Reber's Speech Opposes Fortifying Guam</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Dr. Reber, president of the National Anti-War Association, recently delivered a speech to the Faison Committee, criticizing the plan to expand the military on Guam as an unnecessary act of hostility towards Japan, which could have serious consequences. He said, There are twenty-nine places where members can serve as military bases. Why choose Guam alone? The conclusion stated, "If Japan establishes a base off the coast of Mexico for five million or only one million yuan, or Germany establishes a base on the Caribbean coast for 500,000 yuan, both will be the greatest threat to the national security of the United States."</p>
<h3>Italy's Neutral Military Law Revision Completed Mussolini's Report</h3>

<h3>British House of Commons Questions Loans to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Yesterday, a member of the British House of Commons questioned Overseas Trade Minister Hudson, "Regarding granting China credit loans to promote trade with China, can your minister report on this?

<h3>Zhang Pengchun's Lecture Our New War Strategy Future Indicates Japan's Strength is Declining Enthusiastic Applause in the British House of Commons</h3>

A large number of people attended the meeting. Dr. Zhang discussed the future of China's new strategy in great detail. He said that this new strategy is about to begin. China's past strategy was defensive. The Japanese army repeatedly tried to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army, but all attempts failed. There are now far more Chinese troops than at the beginning of the war. They have been fully trained during the war, so their combat effectiveness is stronger. After describing the nature of the upcoming anti-Japanese war plan in the coming months, he proceeded to discuss the international situation and pointed out that after Japan's war against China, its strength not only did not increase, but greatly weakened. His speech impressed the audience deeply and received enthusiastic applause after the speech.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Maintain Spanish Integrity Seek Peaceful Withdrawal of Italian Troops Geta Expresses Four Demands</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] The British and French governments are trying hard to prevent the overthrow of the Spanish government, because if the rebels win, Spain will become a base threatening British and French territories. Spanish government troops are retreating into French territory in a continuous stream. It is generally believed that the time to make demands on Italy is approaching. Germany will also assist Italy's demands in order to simultaneously raise its demands for colonies. Since the beginning of the Spanish War, Britain and France have long sought to prevent Italy from gaining a foothold in Spanish territory in order to avoid affecting its communication with its colonies. Therefore, Britain and France decided: 1. Britain and France will not recognize the rebel government or provide it with economic assistance until Franco has completely expelled German and Italian troops from Spanish territory. 2. Prevent Italian troops from occupying Menorca. 3. Jointly demand that the rebels not approach the French border. Britain and France are determined to seek peace and withdraw Italian troops from Spanish territory, but Franco's firm demand for unconditional surrender by the government army has dealt a major blow to this effort by Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th] An Italian evening newspaper published an article written by Geta yesterday, in which he listed four points that he believed must be implemented before Italian volunteers withdraw: (1) All Spanish Republican troops who retreat into French territory must be demobilized to avoid threatening the stability of the National Army. (2) Restrict the activities of Republican government leaders who fled to France. (3) All government troops inside and outside Spain must surrender unconditionally. (4) The Republican government must return all treasures and cash from the Spanish bank that it stole and transported to France. Secondly, regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain's official statement in the House of Lords yesterday that Britain and France have an alliance, it is requested that even if a war occurs, no one in Italy is unaware that Britain will assist France. However, what the Italians suspect is whether Britain will pay for France's tough policy under any circumstances, because this policy is the opposite of Chamberlain's policy and is likely to cause international disputes.</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Statement Continue the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] According to an official from the Spanish Embassy in Britain, "Spanish Prime Minister Negrin, accompanied by many cabinet members, has arrived in France and will return home soon to continue the war of resistance. He and his cabinet members will establish a government in Valencia to continue the war of resistance to the end. There are about 300,000 refugees who have arrived in France."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The Spanish government has now rejected the mediation of Britain and France and announced that it will return to Valencia soon to continue the war of resistance in southern Spain. The Spanish Embassy in London announced that Mr. Negrin has decided to fight to the end in the Madrid and Valencia regions with General Ugi's Central Army. The area includes nine provinces and about 47,000 square miles. The land is extremely fertile. It is understood that Mr. Negrin is currently planning to leave one or two cabinet members in Paris to manage refugee issues. General Magy has a well-trained army of about 400,000 men, currently stationed in Madrid, Valencia, Cartagena, and Alicante. At the same time, rebel personnel regard this statement as nonsense. They believe that Franco's army can resolve the Spanish government army in six or eight weeks.</p>
<h3>Rebel Army Officially Claims Determined to Advance South Again</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The Spanish rebel army officially announced that General Franco will send a large army of Spanish Moroccan troops and Italian troops, about 300,000 men, to advance south from Catalonia to attack Madrid and Valencia together with the Central Army. The official pointed out that Franco will adopt a flanking attack between Madrid and Valencia to cut off traffic between Madrid and the Mediterranean Sea. Now both Britain and France are willing to force Spain to compromise with each other, so there is a risk of being involved in international disputes. Therefore, while striving for peace, they are still trying to maintain their own security.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Perpignan, 8th] Spanish rebels have captured the towns of Figueras and Rosas.

<h3>Spanish Rebels Occupy Menorca</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 8th] According to news, the British government has sent personnel to hold unofficial talks with Franco's representative in London.

It is heard that the British government is willing to send a warship for Franco to dispatch and transport representatives to the island for consultation. Menorca is equipped with solid defense fortifications. Even if it is blockaded, it can resist for a long time. The rebel fleet is not easy to approach. If French merchant ships protected by French warships transport food to supply the island, the situation in the future will be even more difficult.</p>

<h3>Dutch National Policy Foreign Minister Announces in the Senate Maintaining Friendly Relations with Germany</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, The Hague, 6th] Foreign Minister Badtinh presented a memorandum to the Senate, emphasizing the need for the Netherlands to maintain good relations with Germany. Since the major powers have no determination to maintain international order in accordance with the law, the Dutch foreign policy is based on the League of Nations. As far as German-Dutch relations are concerned, German Head of State Hitler stated in his speech on the 30th of last month that his country is willing to maintain good relations with the Netherlands. The Dutch government should also avoid any actions that may hinder these good relations. At this time, ideological trends and political trends are intertwined and interacting with each other. If we want to restore normal relations among the various ethnic groups, we must adopt a moderate attitude. Since the European War, Germany has striven to improve and its national power has been greatly enhanced, which the Dutch nation admires very much.</p>

<h3>Palestine Conference: Negotiations Encounter Difficulties; Arab Delegations Refuse to Cooperate; British Government Hopes to Avoid Disputes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The Palestine Conference, convened by the British government and the Mufti party, showed signs of breakdown today. In protest against the National Defense Party's negotiations in London, a general strike occurred in Palestine, accompanied by acts of terror. The Arab delegation refused to cooperate with the National Defense Party to form a united front for discussions with the British government. It is reported that the Mufti party cannot represent Palestine; therefore, despite the British government's invitation, there is no need to come to London. The Mufti party also claimed to be the true representatives of the Palestinian Arabs. The National Defense Party stated that they only wished to have the right to express their views; therefore, in the event of a stalemate, they insisted that the formation of a separate delegation for them should not be opposed. The British government hopes, if possible, to avoid making the discussion situation complicated and fraught with disputes, and is even willing to transform the discussions into trilateral consultations. The main policies of the Mufti party and the National Defense Party differ only on the terrorist policies implemented by the National Defense Party against the Mufti party. On other points, both sides agree: 1. Stop Jewish immigration and prohibit the sale of Arab land to Jews; 2. The British must abandon the plan to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine; 3. The British must abandon the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate plan; 4. Establish an independent, self-reliant Arab government, with Italy and France guaranteeing the current Jewish minority.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the Jewish delegation attending the Palestine Conference, saying that during the extremely difficult situation in Palestine, the Jewish residents' spirit of self-restraint and strict adherence to order was admirable. The Jewish talks are expected to begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] At the opening of the Palestine Conference today, after Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a welcome speech, Prince Saif of the Hashemite family responded, expressing gratitude to the British government for its efforts for truth and peace. He said that Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent efforts to resolve international disputes are evident in his welcoming speech, which will be the greatest basis for resolving the Palestine issue, which has long been of concern to all Arabs and Muslims. We admire Chamberlain's spirit of resolving all disputes with humanitarian sincerity and truth, and hope that this enlightened policy will always be successful.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Talks on adjusting the opinions of the Arab Mufti Party and the National Defense Party continued today. Colonial Secretary MacDonald met with the National Defense Party for a very long time, with only one break from evening to night. It is believed that MacDonald visited the Prime Minister at that time.</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary: Traitors and "Japanese Traitors"</h3>
<p>The China Central News Agency (Chongqing, 6th) reports: "Many Japanese serving as guidance officials and advisors in puppet organizations have recently been found to sympathize with China's resistance against Japan. These Japanese are called 'Japanese traitors.' The Japanese military intelligence department has now begun a general investigation of all Japanese employees in the puppet organizations, and anyone suspected will be dismissed immediately." Furthermore, a Tokyo dispatch on the 7th stated: "According to foreign news, a 'new spy' panic is occurring in Japan, and these 'spies' are mostly serving China." The emergence of "Japanese traitors" and the resulting panic among the Japanese government are sufficient evidence of the crisis in Japan's invasion of China, which is intensifying. Conversely, it also shows that China's united resistance against Japan is becoming increasingly bright.</p>
<p>However, these so-called "Japanese traitors" cannot be viewed "equally" with China's traitors. Why? First, let's talk about Chinese traitors, which now generally refers to all Chinese who betray the interests of the Chinese nation, willingly serve as tools for the × people, and undermine the united resistance against Japan. They use the smokescreen of "anti-communism" and "peace" to carry out their conspiracies of sowing discord and undermining the united resistance; or they use defeatist and surrender theories to numb and erode our national self-esteem and confidence; or they act as spies for the × people to deplete and destroy all our nation's living and inanimate forces. Such people are traitors and spies to the Chinese nation; at the same time, because China's resistance against Japan is a war to defend human civilization and maintain world peace in the international sense, these Chinese traitors and spies are also public enemies of the world.</p>
<p>Conversely, the "Japanese traitors" discovered by Japan are implementing defeatist strategies within the Japanese invasion camp, carrying out sabotage of the war effort, and using various means, under very difficult circumstances, to instigate incidents from within Japan and the invading army, increasing the difficulties for the Japanese invading authorities and assisting the progress of China's anti-Japanese war. Such people are, of course, regarded as spies and traitors by the Japanese invading authorities; in the Chinese and international sense, they are heroes alongside Chinese soldiers in defending human civilization and maintaining world peace. Even from the perspective of Japan itself, because Japan's war of aggression against foreign countries is only for a small number of militarists and plutocrats to gain profit, not only is it of no benefit to the vast majority of the Japanese people, but it will also cause the Japanese people to lose their minimum living conditions in a long and continuous war. Therefore, the work of these "Japanese traitors" completely meets the urgent need of the Japanese people to seek liberation, and they should not only not be regarded as Japanese traitors, but are actually heroes fighting for the liberation of the Japanese nation!</p>
<p>China's defeatists and anti-war activists are enemies of the Chinese national revolutionary front and also enemies of the Japanese people. At the same time, Japan's defeatists and anti-war activists are friendly forces of the Chinese national revolution and also loyal and brave soldiers of the Japanese nation. We must expand propaganda to show that Japan's war of aggression against China is also a war that harms the Japanese nation, and that China's war of resistance against Japan is not only seeking its own national liberation but also helping the Japanese nation to liberate itself. We must welcome and support the anti-war movement under the difficult leadership of the Japanese Communist Party and all righteous and progressive people, and we must further eliminate the anti-communist and anti-war movement of defeatists lurking in China, for the liberation of the Chinese and Japanese nations, and for the sake of defending world peace and human civilization.</p>
<h3>The German-Japanese Espionage Alliance</h3>
<p>Every day at noon, a Japanese dignitary would drive to the German military headquarters on Betle Road, pass through the saluting guards, and enter a solemn office. Inside, a German officer would be waiting, and after bowing to him, would hand him a very heavy box.</p>
<p>The Japanese dignitary would say "Farewell," and the German officer would respond with "Farewell." The Japanese dignitary, carrying the box as if a mother holding a baby, would then walk out of the gate, get into his car, and return to a solemn and magnificent Western-style house on Zoo Road. The Japanese dignitary was none other than Colonel Oshima, the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Germany. From January 26, 1936, he personally collected this box from the German Army Headquarters every day.</p>
<p>The box contained copies of reports obtained by German intelligence agents sent to foreign countries. According to the agreement, the funds used by the German spies to collect secret intelligence were borne by Japan. The collected intelligence was then handed over to the special agency stationed in Berlin. This peculiar agreement was signed at the same time as the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>Colonel Oshima signed this agreement on the instructions of Araki of the Japanese military and the notorious Japanese spy Doihara, in order to reduce the obstacles faced by Japanese spies in their activities abroad.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese government spent five million yen annually on intelligence work, the authorities believed that the materials obtained were not only insufficient but also not necessarily entirely reliable. The appearance of Japanese spies often caused them great difficulties in their work. The world saw these yellow-faced youngsters traveling abroad as spies, which often made it difficult for those who were actually engaged in gathering intelligence to be seen.</p>
<p>Doihara, seeing through this shortcoming, had no choice but to turn his attention to those whose faces were not so easily distinguishable as spies. He sent people to recruit many impoverished White Russian officers in nightclubs in Shanghai and Singapore, forming espionage teams. He sent some of them to sneak into Russia to do transmission work, sending reports back to Changchun. He set up this organization with an expenditure of one million yen. The staff members were all Soviet Russian employees working on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The main person in charge was Arlbar, who went to Weichun every week to report on the work of the White Russian spies. Doihara also had a group of Western spies who, under the guise of tourism, traveled to the Americas, trying to get close to officers in the army, navy, and air force.</p>
<p>Many times, they cooperated with American officers.</p>
<p>In 1935, the Soviet Union's secret police uncovered Arlbar's conspiracy and arrested him on his way to Changchun. He provided a list of Japanese spies operating in the Soviet Union, and as a result, none escaped, and they were all executed in 1936. The American officers who cooperated with them were also arrested in the United States, and the US Army's counterintelligence department used this opportunity to completely wipe out the entire Japanese espionage network in the United States.</p>
<p>The collapse of this espionage organization was to be expected, and the Japanese government was not surprised by it. Politicians close to Araki and Terauchi believed that hiring untrustworthy White Russians as spies was a dangerous policy. They advocated the establishment of a reliable espionage organization, and the head of this group was Nakano Seigo, the leader of the fascist organization Toa Renmei.</p>
<p>Nakano believed that Japan and Germany should form an alliance, with the naval and military departments of both countries jointly funding intelligence work. He sent a young man, Futaki Kita, to Berlin to explore the possibility of cooperation. In 1932, he personally traveled to Berlin to directly negotiate this matter.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Berlin, he presented his plan to key figures in the German military, but the late General Schleicher and Colonel Plietzsch, the head of the intelligence department, expressed no interest in cooperation. Schleicher's secretary, Walter, was very enthusiastic and introduced Nakano to Goebbels and Colonel Nikolaus of the Nazi Party's intelligence department. A Japanese intelligence office was established within the Nazi Party, and the exchange of intelligence began.</p>
<p>In 1933, Hitler came to power, Schleicher was dismissed, and Nakano's proposal was reconsidered by the German military. It received the support of Lieutenant Colonel Lichner, a protégé of Schleicher. Walter, who was then a major, submitted a report to the authorities, which was adopted by the government. In 1934, he was sent to Japan as a military attaché at the embassy, ​​responsible for German-Japanese espionage work. On June 30, 1934, Schleicher and Plietzsch were killed during the Nazi Party's purge.</p>
<p>Nakano returned to Japan and invited Doihara, Araki, and Army Minister Terauchi to a meeting at his home. Walter also attended and spoke extensively, declaring that Germany was very willing to implement Nakano's plan and also establish a joint anti-Soviet treaty. They sat on the carpet, drinking green tea, and forged this German-Japanese espionage alliance, publicly recommending General Araki to be responsible for gaining the support of conservatives in the army and navy for this plan. In 1935, the authorities of both the army and navy agreed to Nakano's plan.</p>
<p>Soon after, Oshima, a henchman of Doihara, was sent to Germany to take charge of affairs. In 1936, he telegraphed Nakano, saying that this agreement had already been effective. (Zhu Wan)</p>

<h3>The Far East Situation is Urgent: Hong Kong's Military Expenditure is Increasing Daily; Reaching Over 52 Million Dollars in the Last Ten Years; Last Year's Increase was the Highest, Reaching Over 6.8 Million</h3>
<p>Due to the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, Hong Kong is actively carrying out all defensive works in preparation for any eventuality. The required military expenditure has also increased accordingly. According to investigations, in the ten years since 1929, Hong Kong's defense military expenditure has reached a total of 52,160,094 dollars. On average, each resident of Hong Kong, regardless of Chinese or Westerner, must bear more than 50 dollars. Among them, payments to the United Kingdom for imperial defense military expenditure account for 50,719,240 dollars. Furthermore, in these ten years, the increase in military expenditure was the highest last year, reaching 6.7 million dollars. During this period, the maintenance costs of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps also reached 1,255,550 dollars. The Hong Kong Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve was established later than the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, only four years ago, so the maintenance cost was only 143,304 dollars. The expenditure of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve is increasing year by year. Last year, the expenditure of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps was twice as high as in 1929, and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve also increased by 70 percent compared to its establishment four years ago. At the same time, the burden of imperial defense expenditure has also doubled compared to ten years ago. The Hong Kong authorities have now obtained the government's agreement to stipulate that the said burden will be fixed at 6 million dollars per year in the future. In the past, Hong Kong's burden exceeding 6 million dollars only occurred last year and in 1932. The following is a list of Hong Kong's annual military expenditure burden in the last ten years:</p>
<p>Volunteer Defence Corps Maintenance Fee　Imperial Military Expenditure Burden</p>

<h3>Overcrowding in Various Parts of Vietnam: Unemployed Overseas Chinese Wander and Suffer; Local Government Arrests and Repatriates Them in Large Numbers; A Message to Overseas Chinese: Do Not Rashly Emigrate to the South</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, compatriots in the country have been affected by the calamities of war and have flocked to overseas countries to make a living. In the past year, the number of people leaving the country through Hong Kong cannot be counted. However, the economies of various parts of Southeast Asia have not recovered, and commerce is still sluggish. As a result, there is a feeling of overcrowding. Recently, a large number of overseas Chinese in Singapore, Penang, and other places have been unemployed and forced to return to the country. According to investigations by reporters, more than a hundred overseas Chinese were also forced to return to the country from Vietnam yesterday due to unemployment. They spoke to reporters about the severe situation of unemployment among overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Wandering and Suffering; The Situation is Extremely Miserable</p>
<p>It is reported that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a large number of compatriots from Fujian and Guangdong have gone abroad to seek a living in Saigon. Among them, people from Chaozhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and other places are the most numerous. Overseas Chinese stores in the local area are all overcrowded. Those who can obtain a livelihood are few and far between. The unemployed are everywhere. Because they have no relatives, a large number of them are wandering the streets, and some have even become beggars, begging everywhere. The situation is extremely difficult and pitiful. This kind of situation is rare in Saigon.</p>
<p>Authorities Issue Orders; Arresting Poor Overseas Chinese in Large Numbers</p>
<p>Last year, the Western Saigon authorities, in view of the wandering of our overseas Chinese, ordered them to return to their country freely and promised to exempt those who returned to the country in early January from paying this year's tax papers. At that time, a large number of people returned to the country. However, because of the lack of travel expenses and the wandering on the streets, there were still many beggars. Most recently, the French authorities, seeing that our overseas Chinese beggars were found everywhere, which was detrimental to the view, specially ordered the arrest and repatriation of more than a hundred people on the sixteenth of last month. Arrests are still continuing one after another.</p>
<p>Local Overseas Chinese; Find Ways to Provide Relief</p>
<p>After our arrests, the shipping costs and living expenses are borne by the various clan associations. It costs 8.8 dollars per person to return to the country from Western Saigon, including food, which is three times more than before the War of Resistance. Now that the number of refugees returning to the country is increasing daily and the prices of boats have also increased, the various clan associations are struggling to cope with the payment of travel expenses. Currently, they are trying their best to solve this problem. It is heard that they will set up a job introduction center to introduce jobs to poor overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the × announced that the restriction on navigation in the Pearl River channel would be lifted on Friday. However, according to the × Consul in Hong Kong, speaking to a reporter from the German-language Hong Kong Telegraph, the so-called restriction is limited to warships of third countries, because he recently requested that warships of second countries temporarily stop navigating the Pearl River channel. As for commercial vessels, they are not yet able to resume navigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs on Jordan Road, Yau Ma Tei Yesterday; Three Thieves Enter a House Armed in Broad Daylight; The Sun Residence Loses Over 300 Dollars</h3>
<p>The residence of Sun Shechuan on the second floor of No. 5 Jordan Road, Kowloon, was robbed by three thieves yesterday afternoon, resulting in a loss of 360 dollars. The thieves disappeared without a trace after succeeding. The authorities have ordered police stations in various districts to pay close attention. The details of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>The residence that was robbed was the residence of Sun Shechuan on the first floor of No. 5 Jordan Road, Yau Ma Tei. The owner is Sun Zisheng, the housewife is Sun Zhangshi, and Sun has a son, Sun Yixing. In addition to these three, there are also three maids and two children in the house. Yixing is nine years old and is currently studying at the Yizhi Girls' Middle School branch, which is located in the Dongchang Bank in Kwan Chung. Yixing goes to school every morning at around 8:00 am and is dismissed at 12:00 pm for lunch, always accompanied by another maid, He Miaoyu, except on Sundays and public holidays. Sun Zisheng works in a large commercial firm and also leaves early and returns late every day, so the only people guarding the door at home are his housewife, Sun Zhangshi, and two maids. Yesterday at 12:00 pm, the maid He Miaoyu accompanied her young master Yixing home. When they reached the door, it was 12:15 pm. When ascending the stairs, Miaoyu went first, and Yixing followed behind. Unexpectedly, someone was following behind Yixing. That person pointed a small knife at Yixing's back and whispered, "Do not make a sound. If you dare to do anything, I will stab you in the back." Yixing, seeing the situation, was speechless and almost unable to take a step. When Miaoyu knocked on the door, she did not suspect that the person following Yixing had ulterior motives. When the door opened, Miaoyu entered, followed by Yixing, and then by the man. After the man, two more people rushed up. The door was already open, and there was no way to close it. The three men then rushed in together. After the three thieves entered the house, in addition to the first thief, who had a small knife, the other two thieves, one held a small sword and the other held a pistol. In addition to Yixing, who was a boy, everyone else in the house was a woman. Suddenly encountering this, they were all dumbfounded and unable to say a word. The one holding the pistol immediately drove everyone into a corner, and the one holding the knife cut the telephone line on the table. The one holding the sword then closed the door and stood in front of it as a lookout. After the one holding the knife cut the telephone line, he took out a bundle of thick rope and tied the women's hands behind their backs, and then stuffed their mouths with several gags to prevent them from calling the police. After everything was done, they then proceeded to search for valuables. As a result of the search, the thieves obtained a gold necklace, one foot and four inches long, worth 200 dollars; a pendant weighing seven mace, worth 70 dollars; a gold ring inlaid with a ruby, worth 30 dollars; a pair of almond-shaped gold earrings, worth 10 dollars; and two overcoats, worth 50 dollars, for a total value of 360 dollars. After the thieves succeeded, they still wanted to continue searching, but they heard footsteps on the stairs, fearing that the owner of the house had returned from outside, which would be bad, so they hurriedly collected the above-mentioned jewelry and left. After the thieves left, the women in the house, after struggling for some time, finally untied the ropes. Because the telephone line had been cut, there was no way to use the telephone to report the crime. They then ordered someone to report to Sun Zisheng and ordered the maid He Miaoyu to report the crime to the Yau Ma Tei Police Station. It was already 1:25 pm. The duty officer at the police station, after receiving the report, immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the house to investigate the robbery and notified the various medical stations to send police officers to patrol in various places, hoping to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Bandits Intercept and Rob Refugees; Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Committee Appeals for the Victims; Sends Letters to Various County Magistrates Urging Them to Strictly Arrest Bandits Who Intercept and Rob Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangdong's areas, refugees from various counties have been displaced and wandering, which is extremely pitiful. However, in some places, bandits and unlawful impostors rob refugees on their way to Hong Kong and Macao, which is inhumane. Yesterday, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, based on reports from various county chambers of commerce, sent letters to the county governments of Dongguan and Baoan, urging them to strictly arrest these unlawful thugs to appeal for the refugees.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong Eagerly Donate to Relieve Guangxi Refugees; Over Ten Thousand Dollars Have Already Been Received</h3>
<p>Since various organizations in Hong Kong initiated the fundraising campaign for Guangxi refugees, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have been donating very enthusiastically.

<h3>Crowd Injures People Outside Refugee Camp; Wen Hua Charged and Detained for Three Days</h3>
<p>At 11:25 am on the 6th, a fight occurred in a field near the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp. Iron worker Qu Ji (33 years old) was beaten by three people and injured. British police officer Luo Zha fired a warning shot to suppress the situation, and a stray bullet injured a passing woman, Lu Yu (22 years old). Details have been seen in previous reports. Further investigation by police detectives led to the arrest of a man named Wen Hua (26 years old), who is suspected of beating and injuring Qu Ji. Yesterday morning, he was charged in the Kowloon Magistracy with committing the crime on the 6th of this month, colluding with two men who are still at large, and using sharp weapons such as axes and awls to beat Qu Ji, intending to injure another person's body. The prosecuting officer requested that the case be adjourned for three days to allow sufficient time to gather evidence. The magistrate approved the request. It was also mistakenly believed that the incident occurred when Chinese soldiers in the refugee camp had once again attempted to escape, and that the guards had fired to stop them. The police authorities denied this.</p>
<h3>The Student Relief Association and the Eastern District Education Association jointly organize a barter fair in response to the One Dollar National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>The Wanchai section of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association and the Eastern District Teachers' Association are jointly organizing a barter fair to support the One Dollar National Salvation Movement. It is scheduled to take place for two consecutive days, the 21st and 22nd, at the Wanchai Southorn Playground. The tentative entertainment items include "Beat the Traitor," "Final Victory," "Present Flowers to the Leader," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," and "Storm the Fortress," totaling more than ten games. Each game will be the responsibility of the schools in the Eastern District. The principal of each school will also be responsible for the decoration of the stalls and the equipment for the games. Barter tickets are available in three denominations: one dime, two dimes, and five dimes. Game tickets are uniformly priced at two dimes.

<h3>× Warships converge on Weizhou Island, Imperial Airways planes reroute to avoid the fate of the Delia</h3>
<p>Recently, × warships have converged on Weizhou Island near Beihai, making threatening movements. Yesterday morning, Imperial Airways planes from Binjiang to Hong Kong, including the Dorada, the Danner Dallas, and the Delia, all rerouted to avoid that area, because the Delia was recently bombarded by × warships in the waters near that area. The first to arrive in Hong Kong was the Dorada, which arrived at 11:30 AM yesterday after circling south of the island. The other two planes, which were originally scheduled to arrive at 4:05 PM yesterday, also flew the same diverted route. The Dorada had not flown since its accident in Binjiang in November of last year. It was carrying 480 pounds of airmail from the UK to Hong Kong. This mail has been delayed for five days. The other two planes were also carrying a large amount of mail from the UK and Australia to Hong Kong. Also on the Dorada yesterday were Mr. and Mrs. Blandy of Jardine Matheson, who were returning from a trip to Calcutta, India. In addition, Mrs. Kerby came to Hong Kong to see her son, who is currently serving in the Navy. Mrs. Kerby will be staying in Hong Kong for several days.</p>
<h3>Great Sympathy: American doctor comes to China to serve, Frederick Hume arrives in Hong Kong, will go to the front lines for relief work</h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese people have suffered misfortune. Those who have died under the aircraft and artillery of the × people number in the millions. People of the world feel anger and indignation about this, and there are many who uphold justice and aid China. Dr. Frederick Hume, a famous American doctor, has also expressed sympathy for our war of resistance, so he has come to China from America to join the International Red Cross and go to the front lines to participate in the relief work for our wounded soldiers and refugees. Dr. Cao departed from America last month on the French postal ship "Asia No. 10" and arrived in Hong Kong on the 7th. The location where Dr. Cao will serve will be determined after discussions with the International Red Cross. (Jun)</p>
<p>Special Feature from This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Serving on the South Xun Frontline</h3>
<p>— Qizhuo</p>
<p>Report by Wu Wenwei, Leader of the South Xun Rescue Team of the Red Cross Society</p>
<p>Salute — to the friends who go to the front to serve the soldiers fighting the war — your sweat and the soldiers' blood merge into an enthusiastic and powerful tide of national liberation, writing a brilliant and great history of national liberation. You, like the soldiers fighting the war, are the excellent children of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Red Cross Society hosted reporters at the Swiss Hotel at 3 PM yesterday. Wu Wenwei, the leader of the South Xun Frontline Rescue Team of the Society, reported on the frontline rescue situation and war experiences. Upon hearing the news, the reporter took two steps forward as three steps and went to the meeting on time. In the meeting place, a man in a yellow military uniform with a Red Cross badge, full of vigor, was emitting light. It must be Captain Wu who has returned from the front line, the reporter hurriedly stepped forward to ask, and then asked several questions that the reporter wanted to know. Captain Wu also enthusiastically talked about it. Just as they were talking vividly, the guests were already full, and Captain Wu brought the conversation to a conclusion and formally opened the meeting.</p>
<p>Everyone sat around the rectangular table. Chairman Zhu Guangtao first reported on the general situation of the Guangzhou Red Cross Society's work in the inland areas. He learned that their spirit of service became more vigorous under the guns of artillery. In addition, several others gave speeches. The following paragraph is a quick summary of Captain Wu Wenwei's separate conversation with the reporter and the public report at the meeting:</p>
<p>Work Dynamics</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Red Cross Society's Frontline Rescue Team, consisting of more than 40 people, brought three ambulances and a large number of materials and equipment. They departed from Guangzhou on October 17 last year to serve on the South Xun route. The monthly cost is approximately 2,000 national currency, which is provided by the Guangzhou Red Cross Society. Under the crazy bombing of the × planes, the front line spread such a sentence: "The daytime is the × people's. The night is ours". Let the air raids be air raids, let us see how many bombs the × people have. However, from dusk to dawn the next day, it is time for our serious work.</p>
<p>The front needs soldiers, the rear needs the people, what about the middle? The middle needs liaisons to coordinate the front and rear. The team is responsible for such a great task. It is like rescuing wounded soldiers from front hospitals to the rear, and escorting soldiers who have been treated in rear hospitals to the front. On the South Xun route, with Nanchang as the center, there are many rescue stations along the road, in addition to rescuing wounded soldiers, and collecting wounded soldiers, they also supply tea and water at the rescue stations to help residents. Female team members also go to hospitals to take care of the wounded soldiers and repair their clothes. The local health work of various groups is also assisted by the team to the best of its ability. There are also rescue training courses to cultivate new cadres. Singing to the wounded soldiers and helping the people to organize joint parties… All of these are within the scope of their work.</p>
<p>Recently, they were ordered to go from the South Xun route to Xiangbei. Now, they are still active in the Changsha area.</p>
<p>Commendable and Touching Facts</p>
<p>The soldiers on the front line with flowers are, of course, a bit irritable, but their emotion of killing × is very high. When family members visit the wounded soldiers in the hospital, not only do they not show sadness, but they also comfort each other very kindly, which makes people unable to help but shed tears. In the Zhuang Ding training camp, when it is time to go to war, the old father encourages his grandchildren, and the wife encourages her husband. It is most decent for a man to defeat the × people, without any worries. Those who are watching are all moved by it. The transportation after the war of resistance is also making rapid progress. From any aspect, it shows that we are fighting stronger and stronger, and final victory is absolutely guaranteed. Therefore, when Wang Jingwei issued a surrender telegram, the soldiers and civilians on the front line were extremely angry and held forums to issue telegrams condemning Wang's treachery. — From this, we can see who is deviating from the demands of the people, and who is the one who is abandoned.</p>
<p>Three Difficulties and Prospects</p>
<p>Captain Wu also reported three difficulties and prospects of the work:</p>
<p>First, the lack of manpower — such a vast war zone, the strength of dozens of people is not enough to distribute. How to quickly transport the wounded soldiers from the front line to the rear? How to make the wounded soldiers shed less blood and reduce the pain? This only hopes that the people in the rear will actively go to the front line to serve.</p>
<p>Second, the lack of hygiene and medicine — it is important to save the wounded soldiers, and it is even more important to save the old soldiers, because they have rich combat experience and the emotions of resistance like the eruption of a volcano. However, the most common festering disease — and "dysentery"... the lack of medicine is deeply felt, and it is hoped that overseas Chinese will enthusiastically donate.</p>
<p>Third, the lack of transportation — an ambulance from the front line to the rear, it only takes five or six hours to go back and forth once, and only a few wounded soldiers are transported. The means of transportation is really not enough to apply. This also requires the help of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>In response to this serious fact that personnel and medicines need to be supplemented, Captain Wu does not hesitate to travel hard from Jiangxi via Zhejiang and Fujian to Hong Kong. He will lead the second batch of 20 team members to Shaoguan during the day, serving in the Wu Qiwei troops in the Dongjiang area. The reporter sincerely hopes that the patriotic bridge compatriots, looking forward to victory and the glorious tomorrow, will provide this group of brave and hardworking rescuers with spiritual and material assistance. If the war of resistance is not over for one day, our responsibility will not be over for one day!</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>A Journey to Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Wang Qixi</p>
<p>In the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic], I and Mr. Zhao Zhiming accompanied a materials vehicle from the Jianyang Automobile Repair Factory, traveling directly from Fuzhou to Jianyang. At that time, both the Min-Gu Road and the Ou-Gu Road sections were not yet open to traffic (the Min-Gu Road runs from Fuzhou to Zhatian to Xi, and was not yet open; while the Ou-Gu Road runs from Gutian to Jian'ou and only recently opened to traffic). Therefore, the road surface was very rough, and coupled with the mud softened by the rain, the journey was difficult. Of the two vehicles traveling together, one broke down halfway and was stranded on the road for more than ten days. We also experienced many hardships before finally reaching Jianyang, which was considered fortunate!</p>
<p>After arriving in Jianyang, we went north to Chong'an to explore the scenic beauty of Mount Wuyi. It was the plum rain season, but fortunately, the weather was kind, and there were two days of clear skies, allowing us to see the famous mountain in the sunshine. On the way back south, we took a boat from Nanping along the Jianxi River, and got to see the perils of the upper reaches of the Min River. The experiences along the way were quite worthy of discussion. Now that the Fujian Provincial Government has relocated to the interior, the status of northern Fujian has become even more important, so our trip should be of interest to readers.</p>
<p>Day 1: Fuzhou to Gutian</p>
<p>This time, two freight trucks went to Jianyang, one a 'Benz' diesel truck and the other a 'Chevrolet' gasoline truck, both fully loaded with materials. Director Li of the repair factory had previously sent a letter inviting me to travel, and I then invited Mr. Zhao to join me. Mr. Wang, the material handler, and I rode on the diesel truck. The other truck was driven by Mr. Xue. Both trucks were originally supposed to depart at the same time, but due to different speeds, they gradually separated. Our truck took the lead.</p>
<p>It was drizzling lightly. The freight trucks had no seats or canopies. We were like cargo piled on the truck. We knew that traveling on an unopened highway would be difficult, so this trip would be arduous, but the hardship would be all the more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The truck left through the West Gate. The highway was mostly built along the mountains, and the project was 80-90% complete. The only remaining work was the road surface and bridges. Therefore, we were driving on a loose and unstable road surface and temporary bridges. Fortunately, the driver's skills were excellent, and the journey was relatively smooth. In the afternoon, the truck passed Xuefeng, where there is a famous large temple that we could see from the truck.</p>
<p>After passing Xuefeng, the highway mostly winds up the mountains. The construction project can be described as massive. When the truck reached the mountain top, it felt like ascending to great heights, and a little carelessness could result in utter destruction. Occasionally, rocks would fall in front of the truck, and we had to find a way to remove them before we could proceed. However, there were even greater difficulties. The sand and soil laid on the road turned into mud after the rain. It is not difficult to imagine the result of a heavy truck driving in the mud. We could only see the wheels slipping, and the truck could not move an inch.</p>
<p>However, we really could not allow the truck to break down, because even if it was stranded for ten days or so on this highway, it would be of no use. Every time, we had to get out of the truck and work on the road ourselves, either filling it with dirt or covering it with turf. Sometimes, we walked for several miles and hired villagers to help push the truck. Fortunately, each section of muddy road was only three or four yards long, and the difficulties could still be overcome. This kind of situation happened no less than five or six times in one day.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., we arrived in Gutian and parked the truck in an ancient temple used by the highway construction team. We also borrowed their telephone to inquire about the other truck, and learned that it was still at Luoqiao.</p>
<p>Gutian is a major county in northern Fujian. It is said that there is a large waterfall outside the city, famous throughout the country, which can be used for hydropower in both provinces. That night, we stayed in a hotel in the city. The city also had electric lights, but the voltage was not uniform, resulting in varying brightness. When it was dim, it was only like a red thread, so we had to constantly switch to light bulbs with different voltages, or else add candles.</p>
<p>Day 2: Gutian to Jian'ou</p>
<p>We set off early in the morning in the rain, proceeding along the Ou-Gu Road. The highway wound up the mountains, turning and twisting, even more dangerous than the previous day. At noon, we passed a steep mountain road. The mud was slippery in the rain, and we could not move forward. We got out of the truck to build the road with our bare hands. The labor was hard but fruitless, and the wheels sank deeper and deeper, making it impossible to drive. We had not eaten since morning, and our stomachs were very hungry, so we rested in a cowshed and ate some dry rations, hoping for unexpected help, because there was no other way.</p>
<p>As expected, our wish came true. In the afternoon, seven or eight workers came, carrying tools and rice cookers, seemingly on a long journey. After inquiring, we learned that they were originally road construction workers on this section, and now that their work was completed, they were heading to Chong'an. This trip would take about seven or eight days. We discussed with them and agreed to let them ride in the truck to Jianyang after they helped us get the truck out of danger. This arrangement was mutually beneficial, because if they rode in the truck, they could build the road at any time, and their travel expenses and time would also be reduced several times.</p>
<p>This group of workers had tools, so they made rapid progress, like pioneers clearing the way. Moreover, they were very familiar with the nearby workers. Through their efforts, more than twenty people were gathered, and they pulled the truck out of the mud and continued forward.</p>
<p>After that, when there were road obstacles or excessively steep slopes, this group of workers would get out of the truck and push it to help overcome the lack of power. When the truck reached Yushan, it was getting late. The mountain was high and the wind was cold, and the sea of clouds was vast. The personnel at the highway office advised us to spend the night there, but we decided to continue forward due to various inconveniences, and drove at night with the lights on.</p>
<p>This section of the road was slightly flatter, and it was planned to open to traffic soon, so there were traffic signs along the way. Where there were curves, where there were slopes, where there were bridges, and where there were dangers, we could get advance notice. At night, this was better than a compass. That night, the truck arrived in Jian'ou at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Jian'ou is an important county in northern Fujian, so at that time there was talk of the provincial government moving to Jian'ou. Its main products are rice, paper, bamboo, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and wood. Shiitake mushrooms are cultivated artificially. It is said that the mushroom cultivation workers are all from a certain county in Zhejiang, and it has become a hereditary specialized occupation. Every year when the mushroom cultivation season begins, no less than tens of thousands of these workers go deep into the mountains.</p>
<p>In addition, Jian'ou also produces a kind of square bamboo, which can be used for making tobacco pipes and walking sticks. It can be used for elegant play, and its price is also quite expensive, depending on the fineness of the carving.</p>
<p>That night, we stayed in a hotel in Jian'ou and chatted and laughed happily, because we had already overcome all kinds of difficulties, and we would be able to reach Jianyang tomorrow.</p>
<p>Day 3: Jian'ou to Jianyang</p>
<p>Jian'ou to Jianyang is 50 kilometers. This section of the highway had already been opened to traffic, and the driver was very familiar with the road conditions. We departed from Jian'ou at about 8 a.m., and at about 10 a.m., we saw a pagoda, knowing that we had reached Jianyang. The truck arrived at the repair factory, where Mr. Li and Mr. Shen greeted us. The two gentlemen had been my colleagues in Shanghai for many years, and we were very happy to see each other. We moved our luggage to the dormitory next to the factory for a temporary stay.</p>
<p>That day was Sunday, so we went to Mr. Li's house for lunch. Mr. Li was newly married and lived in Jianyang, very close to the factory. His wife treated us very warmly, which was deeply appreciated. After the meal, we heard a bell, knowing that it was an air raid alarm, but we did not see any planes.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it was cloudy and rainy again. Led by Mr. Li, we took a car to see the road conditions in the city. The highways here are well-connected, running 118 kilometers south to Yanping and 61 kilometers north to Chong'an. To the west, it goes through Shaowu to Guangze, 110 kilometers. From Guangze to Nanchang in Jiangxi, it is 275 kilometers. To Pucheng, it is 117 kilometers, and from Pucheng to Jiangshan in Zhejiang, it is 112 kilometers. Jianyang is the center of all roads, so automobile repair is the best in northern Fujian, and the work is also very busy. Mr. Li said that every year during mountain floods, many bridges at the streams along the roads are washed away, causing vehicles to be unable to pass, and the work of the repair factory is temporarily suspended. However, the streams and bridges we saw at that time were still two or three yards away from the water, so we did not expect the floods to be so severe when they came.</p>
<p>Jianyang does not yet have a power plant, so the machines in the repair factory are all powered by their own generators. The work and management are successful, and it is said that another generator will be added soon. At night, it is very dark because there are no street lights. Mr. Li invited me to stay in his house in the city, but I politely declined, and stayed in the staff dormitory near the car factory, sharing a room with Mr. Zhao. Mr. Wang and Mr. Shen were both friends, so it was not lonely. The dormitory was upstairs. The joint security office was downstairs, and there were many pots of orchids in the courtyard. I remembered that the homes we had seen during the day also had simple decorations, because Fujian also produces orchids, of a special kind called "Jianlan," with broad and strong leaves, more than two feet long. In early autumn, flower stalks emerge, with several flowers on the upper part of the stem. They are light yellowish-green in color, and have a subtle fragrance. The orchids of Jianyang must be unique to the local soil, because orchids live in secluded valleys, and this place also benefits from the beauty of the mountains and waters.</p>
<p>Day 4: Jianyang</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, I did not see the sunlight, and the heavy rain of the night had not yet stopped. The planned trip to Wuyi could not be made, so Mr. Zhao and I went to visit the city. The city walls of Jianyang have not yet been demolished, but the area is not large. In less than half a day, we had visited the county government, the bus station, the four city gates, and the streets.</p>
<p>The local products of Jianyang include shiitake mushrooms, winter bamboo shoots, mustard greens, "kou lian" [lotus seeds], and tea. The mustard greens can grow to be two feet tall, and have a very rich flavor. "Kou lian" are lotus seeds without the bitter core, which has been sucked out one by one by female workers, hence the name "kou lian" [mouth lotus]. The tea is all picked from Mount Wuyi, and there are many varieties, such as Mingzhong, Baijiguan, Shuixianzhong, Dahongpao, and Tieguanyin. Dahongpao is the most famous and expensive. Mr. Zhao bought a two-ounce package for two yuan, which would be twice the price elsewhere.</p>
<p>In addition to local products, there are also goods transported from Zhejiang. We bought two umbrellas from a store, preparing to brave the rain to visit Mount Wuyi tomorrow. The paper umbrellas of Fuzhou are indeed very famous, but what we bought was an umbrella from Hangzhou, because since the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway opened to traffic, the transportation between Fujian and Zhejiang has become very convenient.</p>
<p>In the evening, Mr. Li and others hosted a banquet for me and Mr. Zhao. During the dinner, we talked a lot about Jianyang, and learned that there is a place where Zhu Xi [a famous Song dynasty scholar] studied, and we also planned to visit it if we had the opportunity. We also heard that Jianyang has a lot of malaria, and many workers in the factory suffer from this disease, so the factory always has medicine on hand, and the bottles of "aspirin" are always empty.</p>
<p>Day 5: Jianyang to Mount Wuyi (Chong'an)</p>
<p>Today, the weather cleared up, which was beyond our expectations. We took a truck to visit Mount Wuyi. Jianyang to Gongguan is 45 kilometers, and Gongguan to Chishi is another 8 kilometers. However, due to the long-term rain, the bridge at Chishi was washed away by the water. The truck could not reach Chong'an directly, and we had to cross the stream on a bamboo raft and walk four or five li to reach Chishi. Chishi is a famous tea market in China, but it has suffered from war, and nine out of ten houses are empty, showing a depressed scene. When we arrived in Chishi, it was almost noon, so we had some noodles and hired a local boy as a guide to enter the Wuyi Mountains.</p>
<p>Mount Wuyi is thirty li (Chinese miles) south of Chong'an County. It is the starting point of the Cathaysia Mountain Range. According to legend, there was a deity named Lord Wuyi who lived here, hence the name. The entire mountain range stretches for 120 li and has 36 peaks and 37 rocks. Along the way, we passed Toad Rock, Three Maidens Rock, and Umbrella Peak, and arrived at Yongle Chan Temple in Tianxin. This is the center of the entire mountain, and visitors must first come here. We were greeted by the guest master, Monk Qingxi, and stayed in a guest room in front of the temple.</p>
<p>After the meal, we toured Eagle Beak Peak, passed Daxin Ridge, and arrived at Liuguanzhai. We heard that the famous Dahongpao tea is produced here. Then we passed the Yanzhan Peak and arrived at the Water Curtain Cave. The rock is a hundred yards high, looking like a hanging curtain. A spring pours down from the top of the rock, creating a water curtain, like scattered pearls and jade, which is a wonder to behold. Next to it is Shentong Rock.</p>
<p>We passed Liuxiang Stream, which is full of fragrant grasses and secluded orchids, hence the name. We arrived at Seven Stars Rock, which has a suspended pavilion. It is said that it was once the residence of Taoists practicing here, but now it is deserted. The so-called pavilion is actually a small house suspended in the air. However, the dangerous rock is more than a hundred feet high, and there is no path to reach it. I don't know how this small house was built or how people lived in it.</p>
<p>Tea trees are planted all over the mountains, mostly less than a foot tall, and the tallest ones are only three or four feet tall. The tea gardens are all built on rocks, piled with mountain soil. Because of the beautiful environment of clouds and rocks, the world-famous rock tea grows here. When the tea season arrives in the spring, the mountains are full of tea pickers, singing mountain songs, which will be a completely different sight.</p>
<p>After returning to the temple, the monks offered us a rare variety of tea to taste. The guest master, Qingxi, was said to have come from the military, but his conversation was very elegant and zen-like.</p>
<p>Day 6: Mount Wuyi</p>
<p>The rock scenery of Mount Wuyi is best at Tianxin and Tianyou, and the water scenery is best at the Nine Bend Stream. Tianyou is currently building a central park, and we will visit it today.</p>
<p>In the morning, the monks hired a worker to guide us, and we passed Leishi Rock, which is named because three rocks lean against each other. Next to it is Leishi Jingjin. Then we went to Matou Rock, below which is Ningyun Taoist Temple. The peach blossoms and flowing water in front of the gate are extraordinary. An old Taoist lives there. Mount Wuyi is one of the thirty-six caves of Taoism, so there are many Taoist temples in the mountains.</p>
<p>Then we passed Wudao Stream, Huma Stream, and other places. At noon, we arrived at Tianyou, where there are many stone carvings with poems by ancient people. There was originally a Chan temple here, but it was destroyed by fire and is now being rebuilt. Climbing to the top, we could see the winding streams. Below were the scenic spots of Jinji Cave. According to its direction, it should be between the sixth and seventh bends.</p>
<p>After touring Tianyou, we returned to Tianxin Temple, passing Sanyang Peak on the way, which is the highest peak in the entire mountain. The peak rises three times, like the shape of a pen holder. The guide said that there is a dangerous cave on it, inhabited by Taoists practicing here, which is not easy to find. Is this the ancient poem that says, "Only in this mountain, but unknown where because of the deep clouds"?</p>
<p>At that time, there were more than ten children, playing drums and holding lanterns, traveling in the mountains. It was not lonely to have such companions on the mountain. Asking them, we learned that they were from Xingcun, and this trip was to offer incense at Tianxin Temple. Xingcun is more than twenty li away from here and is also a famous tea market.</p>
<p>In the evening, there was a sign of rain, and the mountain god came out for a tour. For several days, the monks of the temple had been very hospitable, providing tea, snacks, rice, and meals, all complete. At night, the atmosphere was very cold, and it even snowed. Mr. Zhao and I sat around the stove and chatted, and composed a poem together:</p>
<p>It is magnificent to see the famous mountains,</p>
<p>This trip is mainly to taste tea.</p>
<p>The water curtain of pearls and jade pours from the sky,</p>
<p>The essence of the rocks has been open since ancient times.</p>
<p>The green trees pick fragrance in the spring should be lively,</p>
<p>The legacy of the [Japanese] bandits makes the scenery sad.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will buy a raft and say goodbye to the monks,</p>
<p>The Nine Bend Stream will be returned in one day.</p>
<p>Day 7: Wuyi to Jianyang</p>
<p>In the morning, it rained, so we braved the rain to tour the Nine Bend Stream. The stream is very shallow, with pebbles underneath. We had to float on a bamboo raft, and we could also appreciate the fun of traveling along the stream. Examining the Mount Wuyi map, there are many scenic spots along the stream. I have specially recorded them for reference:</p>
<p>First Bend - First Bend Painting Academy, Zhizhi Hermitage, Dengxian Terrace, Wuyi Palace.</p>
<p>Second Bend - Jade Maiden Peak, Lingxiao Peak, Yanxian Rock.</p>
<p>Third Bend - Five Tiger Peak, Dazang Peak, Xiaozang Peak.</p>
<p>Fourth Bend - Heavenly Pillar Peak, Gengyi Terrace, Li Xian Rock, Royal Tea Garden, Tongxian Gorge, Xiamakeng, Great Guanyin, Small Guanyin, Fangyin Stone, Jingtai, Shumo Stone, Erhui Stone, Shangchenggao, Xiachenggao.</p>
<p>Fifth Bend - Song Wengong Temple, Da Wenping, Xianzhang Rock, Fuhudong, Luohan Cave, Xiao Wenping.</p>

<h3>A Conspiracy to Eliminate Our Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>In short, although the conditions are only five, they are truly venomous and ferocious, enough to completely destroy the little silk foundation China has. If the operators of the silkworm egg farms in the war zone still have any conscience, if they can take a longer view, they should resolutely refuse. 3. Two Lines of Approach in the Future</p>
<p>I heard that after obtaining such favorable cooperative conditions, Da You Silkworm Egg Farm did not immediately accept them, but prepared to use the name of the Wuxian Silkworm Egg Industry Guild to petition the Construction Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government to express its opposition. It is certainly gratifying that the silkworm egg farm does not agree to cooperate with the Japanese side, but merely requesting assistance from the puppet government is not enough, regardless of whether this method is appropriate or not, solely in terms of its effectiveness. Because the traitors are too busy obeying "their masters," how dare they offer any opinions—this error in understanding seems inappropriate now, during the total war of national mobilization. Therefore, under such harsh pressure, how should the various farms cope? I can say that there is no other way except for absolute non-cooperation, but the so-called non-cooperation here does not simply mean closing down the silkworm egg farm and considering the matter finished.</p>

<h3>Prelude to the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Game: Hong Kong Team Practice Match Today at 5 PM at the Navy Ground, Tickets Cost 20 Cents</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The date of the Hong Kong-Philippines interport football showdown is fast approaching, and the football fans will soon have a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The representatives of the Hong Kong Interport Team were selected on Monday evening based on the principle of choosing the best from the best by the selection committee of the General Association. Six Chinese players were chosen for the first team, and Lee Wai Tong was elected as the team captain. This is truly commendable.</p>
<p>The overall lineup has no unsatisfactory flaws. Although many people did not expect Zao La to be selected for the right-wing position, the reporter greatly agrees with this. As far as I know, the Filipino players are the most energetic and agile. They fear fast attacks and slow defense. Therefore, the Hong Kong team's front line must use one or two players who are good at sprinting to be the best strategy. Zao La was selected precisely because he is fierce in sprinting, and thus was appreciated by the selection committee.</p>
<p>The Navy team occupies two positions in the midfield, one is Dickson, and the other is Han Ni Wei Lu. The excellent skills of these two players have long been known to the general public. However, one point is worth noting: all of the Navy's midfielders prefer to dribble the ball and attack. Dickson and Han also share this style. In terms of football strategy, if the team does not use the third inside-forward method, then the center-back must attack to promote the advance of its own front line, but must still act cautiously. According to what I have heard, the Filipino team's front line is very fast and excels at surprise attacks. Therefore, Dickson and Han must be wary of this at the time.</p>
<p>At 5 PM today, the Interport Team will hold a practice match against the Hong Kong League Team at the Navy Stadium. In principle, the Interport Team should regard the Hong Kong League Team as its imaginary enemy, but its greatest goal should be to develop a consistent cooperative effort of the whole team and to understand the connections in each position's responsibilities. Only then will the meaning of this review not be lost.</p>
<p>This gathering of heroes will surely be pleasing to the eye. The ticket price is uniformly 20 cents, which is especially cheap. The lineups of the two teams are as follows: (Stadium Deity)</p>
<p>Interport Team</p>
<p>Tam Kwan Kan (South China Chinese)</p>
<p>Sze Hon (Middlesex), Lee Tin Sang (South China South)</p>
<p>Leung Wing Chiu (South China South), Dickson (Navy Team), Han Ni Wei Lu (Navy Team)</p>
<p>Hou Cheng Tao (Eastern Association), Go San Nu (St. Joseph's), Lee Wai Tong (South China Association Captain), Fung King Cheung (South China South), Zao La (Hong Kong Association)</p>
<p>(Reserves) Wu Lie Zhi, Liao Ya Chen (Kowloon Association), Bi Lu Du, Jin Shi (St. Joseph's)</p>
<p>Hong Kong League Team</p>

<h3>South China Athletic Association Presells Tickets</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Match has been scheduled for the first, second, and fourth days of the Lunar New Year at the Navy Stadium. To avoid overcrowding when purchasing tickets at that time, the General Association has started selling tickets in advance and reservations can be made for seats. The South China Association has obtained the tickets for the best seats for these matches. They will be sold today at the association's billiard room in the Chinese Merchant Association Building and at the General Affairs Office of the association's gymnasium in Jia Shan to meet the needs of the members.</p>
<h3>Wing Yip Brand Mini-Soccer Tournament: Han Ying Wins, 3-1 Against Chinese Police</h3>
<p>In the Wing Yip Brand mini-soccer tournament, the English team played against the police team at the Hutton Ground yesterday (8th) at 4 PM. After the start of the game, the Han Ying team's momentum was fierce, and they frequently attacked the Chinese Police team. Guo Yingqi and Zhang successively scored goals. In the first half, the Han Ying team took the lead with a score of 2-0. After the break, the teams switched sides and fought again. The Chinese Police, having already lost ground, tried to make up for their losses in the late stages of the game, advancing on two fronts. Eventually, Shi Shicai scored a goal. To secure the victory, the Han Ying team's morale was boosted, and Chen Bingtu added another goal, making it 3-1. After that, the two teams exchanged attacks, but neither had another chance to score. At the end of the game, the Han Ying team triumphed with a score of 3-1.</p>
<h3>Inter-School Table Tennis Competition: Awards Ceremony Tomorrow, Exhibition Match Champion vs. Players</h3>

To increase the number of referee talents, the association is inviting foreign basketball referees who are willing to serve the Hong Kong basketball community to submit a letter to the association with their resume. After the Referee Committee reviews and approves their qualifications, they can join as members.</p>
<h3>Next Year's World Games to Include 147 Events in Total, with Numerous New Events for Men and Women, Budget Estimated at 200 Million Finnish Marks</h3>
<p>(Helsinki, January 3rd Dispatch) Since Finland has been actively preparing for the next World Games, progress has been extremely rapid. The parliament has already passed a special budget to enrich the preparatory funds, with a total amount of 200 million Finnish marks (according to the current exchange rate, approximately £1 million or US$5 million). The remaining amount, totaling 100 million marks, has been supplemented by the Helsinki City Government. The municipal government is currently constructing the Olympic Village, located in a lush forest area in the suburbs, with fresh air and convenient transportation. The athletes' dormitories consist of 29 new three-story buildings with a total of 2,500 bedrooms. The dining hall for all representatives will also begin construction soon. The village's general office will be located in a primary school.</p>
<p>At the last World Games held in Berlin, there were 129 events. However, the program for the upcoming games in Finland will increase by three events. The total will include 23 track and field events, 8 indoor sports events, 16 swimming and water sports events, 4 rowing events, 4 yachting events, 9 small boat races, 14 wrestling events, 5 weightlifting events, 8 boxing events, 5 shooting events, 7 fencing events, 6 equestrian events, 1 soccer event, 2 gliding events, and 1 modern pentathlon event. At the previous World Games, there were competitions in handball, field hockey, polo, basketball, and women's indoor sports. In the upcoming games in 1940, the above events will be discontinued and replaced with other new events. These new events include: (1) 10,000-meter race walking, (2) women's shot put, (3) women's long jump, (4) women's 200-meter race. In addition, there will be two new rifle shooting events at 300 meters and 50 meters. The gliding competition is also a never-before-seen event. Therefore, the total number of events has reached 132. Adding 15 artistic competitions, the total is 147 events.</p>
<p>When the competitions are held in the future, major newspapers and news agencies around the world will send reporters to cover the event and report the daily competition status to the outside world. The organizing committee has decided to set up 600 seats in the stadium for the "uncrowned emperors" out of courtesy. The allocation of reporter seats will be based on the proportion of athletes from each country.</p>
<h3>Famous Chinese Soccer Referees Join the British Referees Association</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Two famous Chinese soccer referees, Yue Xiurong and Shen Huichun, were introduced by the Shanghai Westerners' Soccer Association and joined the British Soccer Referees Association as members. The association has approved their membership, and their 1938-39 membership certificates have been mailed to Shanghai. In the future, Yue and Shen can perform duties in any competition under the jurisdiction of the British Soccer Referees Association. It is said that the Chinese referees who will be officiating in the next Westerners' First Division Tournament will also be introduced by the association to join the British Referees Association. It is noted that several Chinese referees have been introduced by the National Sports Advancement Association to join the International Soccer Referees Association as members, but Yue and Shen are the pioneers of Chinese referees becoming members of the British Referees Association.</p>
<h3>The Effectiveness of Morning Exercises</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since participating in the second symposium of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Physical Education alumni association in Hong Kong, I have been pondering about the sports situation in Hong Kong. This problem has been on my mind at all times and cannot be suppressed. "Morning exercises" are one of the things I pay the most attention to. Compatriots, everyone think about it, Hong Kong is a place where every inch of land is precious, and there is definitely a major problem in terms of air quality. In the past reports, the number of deaths from tuberculosis accounted for the largest number, which is the most obvious proof. To solve this problem, we certainly cannot seek external solutions - eating medicine and injections are certainly not fundamental solutions, we must find and study internally to get the most appropriate method, which is the most important, and everyone should practice "morning exercise."</p>
<p>Compatriots, everyone underestimates the most important "morning exercises" too much, and even many schools cannot pay attention to it, which is the most regrettable thing. Although the environment for sports in Hong Kong is not good - there are too few places to practice sports - we should not be overcome by the environment, but rather make full use of the environment to practice sports. For example, rooftops and alleys can be used as our sports fields, which is not impossible, it just depends on whether we know how to use them.</p>
<p>Whenever I go to any school or group, the sentence I like to say to the students the most is, "Go to morning exercise on time every day, don't be afraid of things going wrong." I earnestly hope that compatriots and comrades in sports can put my seemingly unreasonable words into practice, but when you really have the courage to practice them, you must also follow the rules of "going to bed on time" and "getting up on time."

<h3>Understanding the Physical Training of Children</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>In this world where the fittest survive and the weak are prey to the strong, brutal wars are unavoidable. If we do not want to be the parents of slaves, we must, from today onwards, actively train the physique of our children to prepare them for future calamities. Therefore, parents today should actively promote sports, not only to seek survival for the country, but also to seek the greatest happiness for their descendants.</p>
<p>A strong country must first have a strong race. Today, all countries in the world attach importance to sports. Strengthening the race must start with children.</p>
<p>Physical training methods for children are different from those for adults. This is not entirely because children are not able to handle adult sports, but because children have different needs in terms of body and mind. For example, walking and cycling are good exercises for adults. Although children also have enough physical strength to handle them, these exercises are not very suitable for children, because these exercises only benefit a part or a small part of the body, and cannot make the whole body develop evenly. Therefore, for children, it will cause the harm of uneven physical development. This harm is enough to affect the normal development or growth of children's bodies, as well as their future physique.</p>
<p>The most suitable exercise for children is systematic freehand exercises. These exercises should also vary depending on age and physical strength. Freehand exercises have great effects on children in terms of physical and ethical training, and can train children's self-confidence, will, ability to adapt to the environment, friendship, loyalty, and other qualities.</p>
<p>Freehand exercises are the most economical in terms of "time," "place," and "things," but there are still many children who do not have this opportunity due to environmental factors. Therefore, some people think that to promote this exercise, the greatest effect cannot be achieved unless the government, public organizations, and educational authorities such as schools implement it effectively. Although this is not without reason, the most effective method is to promote it effectively by the above-mentioned organizations on the one hand, and to make this atmosphere permeate into the family on the other hand. Parents should also have a deep understanding of the importance of health and this exercise.</p>
<p>In the curricula of middle schools and primary schools, physical education is a compulsory course, and sports are promoted by means of guidance and compulsion. However, the results are not significant, and even the number of victims is not small. The main reasons are nothing more than improper guidance, staff members failing to perform their duties, lack of deep understanding of physical education, and neglect of the relationship between exercise and age or individual physical needs. For example, applying adult or adolescent sports to children is a major mistake. There are countless other mistakes in methods.</p>
<p>Physical training is more important for children than for young people, adults, and the elderly. Childhood is not only the foundation of our life, but also the time when our bodies are not yet mature. Although physical training is very important, if the exercise method is slightly wrong, it will have a major damage to the body, and it will also have a great impact on the future.</p>
<p>Most children are active, but there are also very few who are not interested in sports. For the former, we should of course guide them in appropriate ways. The most regrettable thing is that we do not know how many children who love sports have had their great futures buried due to improper guidance. For the latter, we should inspire their interest and study the reasons why they are not interested in sports.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to correct mistakes. As long as we are determined to improve, it is never too late for anything. We must pay close attention to the factors related to health or body, especially in childhood. In this period, if we develop bad habits, it will be difficult to get rid of them in adulthood. Physical training is also the same. Moreover, in childhood, we should develop good habits in daily life, first establish a strong foundation, and prepare to cope with future heavy burdens or harsh environments.</p>
<p>The main purpose of children's exercise is to improve health, with emphasis on the training of the trunk and internal organs. Muscle development is secondary.</p>
<p>As for the development of the physical and mental aspects, no two people are exactly the same. Therefore, there is no fixed standard for children's physical training, and of course, the different needs or different physical and mental development of each person cannot be ignored. The same exercise should not be applied to all of them. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Movies and Theater</h3>
<p>Entertainment……Dream Lover</p>
<p>The Shopworn Angel</p>
<p>The film depicts a young man and woman tossed about by different destinies. One is a sincere and honest farmer's son, about to be sent to the front lines of a ruthless war. The other is a gold-digging showgirl, her soul deeply scarred and her fate uncertain. Both seek fulfillment of their "dreams" amidst a frightening reality, and their dreamlike "love" provides them with much encouragement and comfort.</p>
<p>Margaret Sullavan plays a worldly gold-digging showgirl in this film. She sacrifices the attentions of a wealthy man who woos her and, under special circumstances, accepts the love of a sincere young man who has already enlisted. Although she fully understands that a love between herself, accustomed to a life of luxury and indulgence, and this simple young man is almost impossible, she marries him just before his departure to fulfill his dream.</p>
<p>The film vividly and realistically depicts the mobilization situation when the United States joined the European war and the social dynamics full of tense wartime atmosphere. Margaret Sullavan's excellent performance in "Three Comrades" left us with an indelible impression. In this film, her suitable character also results in a very satisfactory performance. James Stewart's acting in the film is as excellent and moving as in "Seventh Heaven." Walter Pidgeon's performance is also commendable.</p>
<p>Empress &amp; Peace Together……Youth Takes a Fling</p>
<p>Youth Takes a Fling</p>
<p>The film depicts a sentimental shop assistant pursuing the man of her dreams. Unfortunately, the man is somewhat dull and only interested in his nautical career, paying attention to nothing else. Women are no exception. No matter how affectionate and lovely the shop assistant is, she can't win his favor. Eventually, he decides to avoid her entanglements altogether. However, the pain of seasickness shatters his nautical dream and cures him of his heartlessness.</p>
<p>Although the film tries its best to enrich its content with various scenes, such as fashion shows and public swimming pools, it still fails to completely conceal the emptiness of its content. As for the actors, Andrea Leeds still has a charming performance. As for Joe McСrea, who plays the young man obsessed with sailing, although his portrayal of the character is a bit exaggerated, he is the central figure of interest throughout the film.</p>
<p>Oriental……The Divorce of Lady X</p>
<p>The Divorce of Lady X</p>
<p>Produced by Alexander Korda of England. The story takes place at a banquet in a large London hotel, where a heavy fog prevents the guests from returning home. They borrow rooms from the hotel, but because there are not enough rooms, a young woman breaks into a single man's room. This is how the story unfolds. The performance is very humorous and has an American flavor. Merle Oberon's performance is just right. The male lead is a British star and his performance is mediocre.</p>
<p>Great China……Bluebeard's Eighth Wife</p>
<p>Bluebeard's Eighth Wife</p>
<p>The famous director Ernst Lubitsch has always directed many romantic comedies with his light and wonderful style. This film, which appears before us, suits his special talents. He handles it with ease and skill, and the results are quite excellent. Furthermore, with Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert playing the male and female leads, it is like icing on the cake, making this film worth watching. Originally, Gary Cooper was known for playing Western cowboys. In this film, it seems that his talents are not fully utilized. Although he has tried his best, he still seems to be a bit inferior to Claudette Colbert.</p>
<p>New World……Modern Woman Seeking a Husband</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>Adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Seeking a Husband." The story tells of a millionaire with a million-dollar fortune who is extremely stingy. Not only does he refuse to contribute to any public welfare undertakings, but he also tries to take advantage of others. At this time, various circles initiate fundraising to establish a refugee industrial factory and want to ask him for help. However, as a result, he not only does not take out any money, but also helps himself to several pastries at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devises this "Modern Woman Seeking a Husband" plan to trick him and then use female charms to seduce him.</p>
<p>The main actors are the famous stage performers, Ma Sze-tsang and Tam Lan-hing. It also shows the producer's business acumen.</p>
<p>The directing technique is still quite flexible.</p>
<p>Central……Hu Huigan Fights in the Machine Room</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>Because of the extremely good box office results of "Fang Shiyu Fights on the Stage," smart producers saw the business opportunity. This film is produced from that motivation.</p>
<p>Hu Huigan is weak and incompetent and is bullied by the people in the machine room. After his father is killed, they even want to seize his wife and younger sister. Forced by circumstances, Hu Huigan decides to leave the machine room and go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts so that he can take revenge in the future. After many hardships and dangers, he finally returns one day and avenges his father's death. The plot of this film is that simple. The director has no technique to speak of. Kwong Shan-siu changes his style to play Hu Huigan, and his performance is still acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the screen for a long time. In this film, she makes a comeback, and her performance is good. The sets in the whole film are too simple, and the fight scenes are not tense enough.</p>
<p>Lee Theatre &amp; Ko Shing Theatre Together……Hua Mulan</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>The plot depicts a modern woman who, because she has performed the stage play "Hua Mulan," always wants to be a modern "Hua Mulan." Sure enough, when the national crisis is severe, she realizes her ambition. The reason is that she discovers a well-organized traitor organization. Therefore, she and her lover Kwong Shan-siu work together to break this secret organization and steal documents. No one knows how many difficulties they have gone through, but they finally achieved their goal. Even the clever and confused traitors are moved by their great spirit and set off to the front lines together.</p>
<p>We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot utilize film techniques. The acting skills of Kwong Shan-siu and Chan Wan-sheung are very poor.</p>
<p>Taiping……The Heroic Children</p>
<p>Mandarin Film</p>
<p>Because there are no irrational elements like in monster movies, this film by Xinhua Company is not too bad, although it can't be said to be very good either. Many places in the play that should have been tense were passed over blandly. Koo Lan-chun, the actress who became very popular after the war, performed fairly well.</p>

<h3>View of Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>— Mo Xie</p>
<p>This is right, and that is wrong. Right and wrong are inherently difficult to define. Some even say that right is wrong and wrong is right. What is right here may be wrong there, and vice versa. Women being fair-skinned and tall is considered beautiful in most civilized countries, but in Africa, black and short is the epitome of beauty. There are countless other examples.</p>
<p>Because each side insists on its own right and denies the other's, and because they cannot agree on what is right and wrong, disputes, quarrels, and even fights arise between individuals. Between countries, protests, severing ties, and even war break out over disputes about right and wrong, leading to "trouble."</p>
<p>But is there really no standard for right and wrong? Not necessarily. There is always a standard. As far as beauty is concerned, loving beauty and hating ugliness is universal, even though the standards of beauty and ugliness may differ. Furthermore, throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have always been many unchanging truths that define the scope of right and wrong, as unbreakable as the fact that humans eat food and dogs eat excrement. These unchanging truths include benevolence, righteousness, peace, justice, etc. No one dares to say, or will say, that these virtues are bad or "wrong," and that we should not develop but eliminate them.</p>
<p>However, "clever people"—who are actually shameless individuals—have the ability to distort facts and reverse right and wrong. They call aggression "friendship." They call selling out the nation "seeking national survival." They call monopoly and hegemony "maintaining common interests" and "open door policy." They call others their slaves, to be used by them, but say they are their friends, sharing glory and wealth. In short, they know clearly what is right and what is wrong, but they do not hesitate to make wrong into right and right into wrong. And they want others to be as ignorant of right and wrong as they are and blindly follow their version of right and wrong.</p>
<p>I think if they continue to act recklessly like this, perhaps one day it will become a habit. Their conscience will be extinguished, and they will genuinely recognize wrong as right and right as wrong. Therefore, when we want to eat food, they may say that food is inedible and that we should eat excrement instead, or that excrement is food, or even that they have always eaten excrement and will continue to eat it in the future.</p>
<p>Recently, it is said that this group of troublemakers is using their silver tongues everywhere, turning black and white upside down, and spreading their heresies, wanting us to "cooperate" with them and take their right and wrong as our own. I think, "The heart that knows right and wrong is in everyone." We are unlikely to be fooled by them. "Those who have no sense of right and wrong are not human!" Those who echo heresies become people who don't eat food, but dogs who eat excrement!</p>
<h3>Small Shadow</h3>
<p>— Jin Yu</p>
<p>In the messy luggage, I found a small photo.</p>
<p>Looking at this small photo, a wave of emotion surges in my fragile heart, bringing to mind the beautiful and glorious early chapters of his life.</p>
<p>Under the bright lights, doesn't his youthful face appear? Who would believe that such a handsome warrior, fighting for justice, would have his life cruelly snatched away by a merciful God?</p>
<p>The bombing on the Izumo warship, the night attack over Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Is that just a legend? The air battles to defend Wuhan, the long march across the East China Sea, how much glory did he win back for the people of his motherland! He had a good environment, he had a happy family, and his youthful years should have been so blissful. But for the survival of his country and people, he finally took his precious life and perished with the × enemy warships in the rolling Yangtze River!</p>
<p>Doesn't the inscription under the small photo clearly read: "I urged myself early to join the army, vowing not to return without beheading Loulan!" How is it that the ink of the inscription is still so fresh, while his precious life has left the world forever.</p>
<p>Amidst the cluttered review, a faint sadness inevitably surfaces in my heart. Besides regretting the brevity of his youthful years, I also feel that the people who live in the island country of cherry blossoms are a group of damnable things!</p>
<p>The heroic face in the small photo fills my heart with sorrow and hatred. The sounds of the anti-Japanese war seem to mock my weakness as pitiful.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>……Folk Novel</p>
<p>This book was written by Jiang Risheng in the early Qing Dynasty. It tells the story of Zheng Chenggong and his descendants. It begins with a preface by Chen Qiyong of Minyuan in Kangxi's Jia Shen year and a "Genealogy of the Zheng Family." There are editions published by the Qiu Wu Bu Huo Zhai, the Shanghai Shenbao Press, and the Wenming Bookstore's Stone-Printed Notes on Novels, totaling thirty volumes. Each volume is accompanied by a seven-character couplet, indicating that each volume is treated as a chapter. This is the only chapter-based novel included in the "Notes on Novels," but strictly speaking, if the seven-character couplet chapter titles are removed, this book is not very different from ordinary classical Chinese notes like "Stealing Anger Records."</p>
<p>Because this is a work from the early Qing Dynasty, perhaps to avoid falling foul of literary censorship, the person who wrote the preface inevitably shows bias towards the foreign race: "Chenggong was granted the surname of Longwu and fled overseas. For thirty-seven years, he upheld righteousness and maintained his integrity, almost the choice of Tian Heng. However, from the perspective of our dynasty, he was merely a surviving soul of the defeated kingdom, a desolate spirit in the corner of the sea. Judging him by the standards of resisting our rule, what more can be said? We respectfully observe our Emperor's divine achievements and sacred brilliance, surpassing all ages. Zheng was punished for rebelling and appeased when he submitted. We also look up to the Emperor's boundless benevolence and extraordinary grace, completing the unification of China and foreign lands, establishing the foundation for billions of years." I believe that even under the pressure of the environment, words like the above still exceeded the scope of tolerance. It seems that these few words were not said unwillingly, but rather with a flattering component. In this case, we have no way to defend Chen Qiyong.</p>
<p>Jiang Risheng is from Fujian, and writing about Fujian affairs from the perspective of a Fujianese, of course, there are many materials that people from other provinces would not know. Recently, Yu Zongxin's "Ming Yanping Prince's Taiwan Sea Kingdom Records" used this book as one of the important materials.</p>
<p>This book takes Zheng Chenggong and his descendants as the warp, and the turmoil at the end of the Ming Dynasty as the weft. Notable examples include Volume 4, which writes about Emperor Chongzhen hanging himself on Coal Hill, and Volume 5, which writes about "Huang Daozhou's Death in Nanjing."</p>
<p>Zheng Chenggong's part is only from Volume 6 to Volume 12. In these seven volumes, only Volumes 10 to 12 are relatively tense. Because it is written in classical Chinese and the imagination is not rich, there are few successes. Gan Hui, who is depicted with more effort, also cannot show his personality. But this book seems to be a little better than "Qifeng's Compilation."</p>
<p>Jiang Risheng's attitude is the same as the person who wrote the preface. For example, Volume 6 says: "Chenggong commanded Ma Xi, Gan Hui, etc., to attack Tong'an," "The power of the bandits was vast." Referring to Zheng Chenggong as a bandit, and considering Zheng Chenggong's desire to restore the lost land as invading troops crossing the border. Volume 10 says: "Liang Huafeng followed the sea bandits straight into Guazhen, then detoured to Jiangnan." Even in the tone of a third-person observer, Zheng Chenggong is still called a sea bandit, which is a regrettable thing. But the author does not have excessive insults towards Zheng Chenggong. Some people even say that the author "implies a subtle meaning of pessimism," which is somewhat comforting.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>— Su Geng</p>
<p>—Behind-the-Lines Notes, Part Two—</p>
<p>Last night, I received a phone call from headquarters, saying that a certain commander-in-chief would personally visit City C today to review the civilian-dressed troops of Jin County. Therefore, the brothers got up especially early today.</p>
<p>As soon as the reveille sounded, the brothers got up one by one. Each person rubbed their sleepy eyes, put on their clothes, and tied their leggings. After that, everyone was busy tidying up their bedding, folding their blankets, and laying out their mats. Everyone was running around, and the entire unit was shrouded in a busy atmosphere. A rare solemn expression appeared on everyone's face.</p>
<p>Just as the clock struck seven, all the brothers in the large team were armed. After an inspection, they set off on the highway one or two li away from the team headquarters. The entire team was lined up on the highway.</p>
<p>Wang Sanzi, a vendor who set up a stall by the highway, was driven away by the soldiers who were sent out to maintain order. He moved his vendor's stall to an open space at the intersection of Chen Zhuang Road, staring blankly at the many people on the highway here, with a strange expression on his face. Yes, he still didn't know why the soldiers wouldn't let him set up a stall by the highway and drove him to this intersection. Moreover, the strange thing that so many people with guns suddenly appeared on the highway today also made him feel confused. However, based on his "intelligence" and past experience, he judged that some high-ranking official must be coming...</p>
<p>Before eight o'clock arrived, a long highway was already filled with armed soldiers. The noisy voices of talking echoed in the sunlight of the winter morning. The early winter sunlight, with golden light threads, warmly shone on the people. The people were enthusiastically restless under the golden light threads of the sun.</p>
<p>All the brothers of the Second Large Team gathered on the highway, waiting for the review by a certain commander-in-chief. As the waiting time grew longer, the brothers became anxious. The solemn atmosphere began to turn into relaxed conversation!</p>
<p>"Hey, Lao Hu. Why hasn't he come yet?" This was Xie Haishan's question.</p>
<p>"Hmm, he'll be here soon, don't be anxious." Lao Hu, standing in the front row of Xie Haishan, glanced at the highway ahead and answered him casually.</p>
<p>There were more people on the highway. All kinds of armed troops were gathered here. The stretcher teams also all set off.</p>
<p>A team wearing plain clothes, each with a hoe, rake, and iron shovel on their shoulders, marched in a mighty manner. Everyone was wearing a straw hat, and their rough and simple faces had a slightly flustered expression, causing the brothers to burst into laughter. Xie Haishan, standing behind Lao Hu, said with a smile:</p>
<p>"What are they doing here? Are we calling them to the front lines to farm?"</p>
<p>"The common people! The common people's… destruction team!"</p>
<p>"Destroy what?" Xie Haishan said, looking at their retreating figures.</p>
<p>"Des…destroy the highway! When the Japanese devils come, they destroy the highway." Lao Hu was relatively clear-headed. He knew the strength of the common people, so he did not doubt the strength of the destruction team, but he did not understand the role of the destruction team, so he could only use the words that Captain Wu told him the day before yesterday to answer Xie Haishan.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the firecrackers in front went off, and then the military music also sounded. The news that the commander-in-chief was coming was quietly transmitted in the team. The relaxed minds of the brothers became tense again. The noisy conversation was immediately replaced by a solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief arrived at the station, got out of his private car, and slowly walked over with the welcoming officials. The military music followed behind them, playing leisurely. The brothers stood straight, and a solemn atmosphere enveloped the entire surroundings. The team was deathly silent, only the frantic beating of the brothers' hearts could be heard.</p>
<p>The sun was hanging in the sky, and golden threads of sunlight were floating in the sky. The commander-in-chief was welcomed to the headquarters, and the review ended. The brothers, with excited and weary hearts, walked back to the team headquarters. That team of destruction workers also each put on their straw hats, and carried their hoes, rakes, and iron shovels on their shoulders, and walked back to their old homes.</p>
<p>January 16, 1939, at the Eighth District Headquarters</p>
<h3>Ruins and Gunsmoke</h3>
<p>— By Shiro Ozaki, Translated by Huanping Lin</p>
<p>Upon entering Poyang Lake, the color of the water changed as we watched. How many days had it been since we had seen clear water? The temperature was also hot. Just watching the long flow of the Yangtze River in a daze, my heart was extremely bitter.</p>
<p>However, here there were cloud shadows reflected in the water. I looked up at the sky. Gleaming cloud lines. It had never been so beautiful as it was today. The temperature did not suddenly drop, but the natural scenery that came into view was full of freshness, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I saw it everywhere. My heart was filled with a melancholic homesickness that could not be cut off or sorted out. In Hukou, there was the headquarters of the Yangtze River Fleet of the Navy. If Anqing was the first foothold in the upstream battle, then Hukou could be said to be the second foothold in forcing Jiujiang. As the port gradually approached, the antique charm of the town also emerged like a penetrating dye. The deep cliffs surrounded the town like city walls, and the color of the red earth seen under the rocks shone dazzlingly in the sunlight. Perhaps the most unbelievable thing was that it was more ancient than any city along the Yangtze River we had passed through so far. Anyone could see this at a glance. As soon as we arrived at the docking station headquarters, we were immediately led by Colonel Inoue to inspect the town for a week. The steep rocky mountain standing on the left-hand side was the famous Shizhong Mountain (Stone Bell Mountain). The National Government seemed to be desperately burying it as a military stronghold. The headquarters of the former Chinese Navy was there. The small port was piled high with small boats. Soldiers wearing tight-fitting clothes were loading and unloading cargo. Colonel Inoue pointed at them and said:</p>
<p>"Those are not conscripted soldiers, they are boatmen who volunteered."</p>
<p>That being said, the movement of the whole was expanding freely without being aware of it. Even if there were unusable points in the movements, the mood was good. The naturally generated control made every gesture and movement beneficial to survival, or so it felt to me. When the Japanese army landed, the residents of the town, like everywhere else, had all fled. Almost a month had passed today, and there were no signs of them coming back. All that was left were the temple keeper of Shizhong Mountain and an old servant woman with a child. No matter what we said, we couldn't communicate with them. They wouldn't eat anything we gave them either. The temple keeper devoutly held the small Buddha statue and worshipped it day and night. He was probably eating grass roots or something similar. By changing personnel and things, we tried to approach them, but they did not accept our kindness at all, so now, we simply ignored them.</p>
<p>Colonel Inoue, who was over fifty and had a beautiful, half-white moustache, said to me like this?</p>
<p>"So, are they spies?" I asked.</p>
<p>"—At the beginning, we were also wary: but we did not discover any signs of them being spies. I think that perhaps their will is strengthened by a long-term belief (—referring to the belief in resisting Japan—Translator)."</p>
<p>Besides this old woman living in the ruined city, only the family of the pastor remained in the French church. In addition to the troops responsible for security, there were also more than two hundred coolies used by the army. Although they were paid with military scrip, they could not use it because there were no residents. As for Japanese people other than the military, there were only a couple who had come from the mainland four or five days ago to run a photography business. The young couple seemed to have a very good relationship. Lieutenant Furutaka, who looked like a generous savage, laughed and said this:</p>
<p>"It's unlikely that they can do much business with the army as their target. In short, it's troublesome—seeing them sleeping in in the morning, it's also cautious, and at night, what is it like? Also cautious." (To be continued)</p>
