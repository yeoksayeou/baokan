<p>社評</p>
<h3>阿爾巴尼亞戰雲與歐局</h3>
<p>歐洲時局，一波未平，一波又起，看到這幾　的電訊，阿爾巴尼亞又為戰雲所籠罩，形勢岌岌可危了</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞是巴爾幹六國之一，位居巴爾幹半島的西面，東北和南斯拉夫相連，東南與希臘交界，西面則瀕臨亞得里亞海而和意大利相望，形勢重要，夙有巴爾幹諸國之重心的盛譽。近年法西斯侵略勢力縱橫歐洲，希特勒得步進步，莫索里尼更自恕其相形見絀，近為索取援助希特勒的代價起見，急謀擴張其在地中海的勢力；而鞏固亞得里亞海上的軍威，尤為重要戰略月的之一。阿爾巴尼亞地處中歐南下孔道，適當莫索里尼進一步侵略的鋒刃，自屬毫無疑問；何况阿國還具有大量未開發的礦藏，還具有向為列强爭奪目標的石油產量呢！再則，當此英國政府漸有積極改變外交政策傾向之際，莫索里尼發動佔領阿國的軍事，則並可威脅阿國近隣的南斯拉夫和希臘兩國，使不敢採取反對德意侵畧軸心的步驟，進而控制全部巴爾幹諸國，更大地削弱與孤立英法兩國。</p>
<p>根據上面的分析，我們應該認淸下面幾點：卽第一，意大利侵略者進佔阿爾巴尼亞，在於爭取阿國的統治權，尤注意於刼取阿國的石油，同時藉以鞏固亞得里亞海，進而作控制及封鎖地中海英法交通的準備，此舉顯然是意大利對英法進一步攻勢的開始。第二，意大利侵略者進佔阿爾巴尼亞，同時威脅南斯拉夫希臘以至全巴爾幹半島諸國，加以最近意德侵略的魔影在巴力斯坦及伊拉克各地的亂舞，顯可證明英法兩國已任法西斯侵畧者進一步的包圍之中了。第三，意大利侵略者進佔阿爾巴尼亞，實獲德國侵畧者的積極支持，四月五日美聯社羅馬電卽稱，「意當局已秘密調動海陸空軍實力，並將亞爾斯的軍隊總部。由羅馬轉移托蘭陀，又一隊德車，已向意境進發」。同時德方進窺丹麥荷蘭的消息亦躍現於各報。由此更可見德意內部矛盾雖在發展，而在侵略行動上，軸心必更顯得强國」，聯系必更緊密，一切逾分誇大侵略陣綫分裂的論調，實屬毫無根據的。最後，我們看到歐局又轉緊張，而蘇偽邊境衝突，又有突發的消息，可以證明侵畧者正在力謀東西互相呼應，我們應該注意日本侵畧者籍此而發動其在遠東方面的軍事上和政治上的陰謀！</p>
<p>針對着這些嚴重的事態，我們應該强調指出：國際法西斯侵略者進一步的攻略，是整個的，全面的；受到威脅和損害的，是民主和平各國，而不僅若干小國，然而同時我們亦應該指出！法西斯侵略者進一步的攻峉，又為針對最近蘇聯和平外交的成功與民主和平陣綫强化的這一事實而來，這可顯現出他們的戰畧地位已有退化到被動的傾向，又可以證明他們的攻勢是可以克服的可以戰勝的！因此我們目前的任務，是要加緊團結一切愛護民主與和平的勢力，用實力來打擊侵略者這種新的進攻。據四月五日美聯社倫敦電，「英政府現正考慮增强和平陣綫計劃，聞該項計劃係謀建立一種各國軍事策畧協商之制度（建立國際軍事戰略局）」，這當然是適應當前進急需要的重要對策之一，我們除了原則上應予贊助之外，更應推進英法美蘇各國政府，迅速認眞建立應付法西斯侵略者的國際會議的形式，運用這一形式以圖解决國際爭端之時，首先要確認「和平不可分割的眞理，要確認法西斯侵畧威脅的國際性，要反對一切不澈底因而亦不生效的片面保證成局部解决，要反對一切專談歐局而漠視遠東侵略者之猖獗的主張。其次，要認眞切實地聯合一切愛謢民主與和平的國家，這裏不能僅以蘇聯參加為滿足，還要加緊團結一切小國，弱小民族，特別是還要切實認淸英勇抗戰二十餘月的中國對於世界的貢献，及其在目前國際的重要地位，任何解决國際爭端尤其是關於制裁法西斯侵略者的國際會商，如果沒有中國參加，並注意到中國今日所處的地位及其利益，則我們斷難想像其會有任何滿意的結果，這是我們所要特別指出，也是我們所要特別努力的地方。」</p>
<h3>中國之友在中國（一）</h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>李蒙先生是法國人民連綫政府時代全國兩個電台的台長之一，同時還兼國　屬內閣總　宣傳部的副秘書長，在與論上極有聲譽。這次是以巴　新歐羅巴雜誌和歐特日報的特派記者名義，經過我們駐巴黎大使顧維鈞　士的介紹而來中國。　士美女士　「世界之　」雜誌的電影計者。她是法國的歐戰時病死在前綫的郭士美將軍的女兒，她有兩個哥哥一個任駐北菲士尼斯一帶的海軍上校，另一個則為　政府裏的重要顧員。她能以一個出身於貴族的女子嫁由工人出身而還未進過止式大學的企蒙，從這點看，也　可以想見她的思想　精神的確都有值　讀佩的地方。他倆要　力以文字和照片，記錄日本軍　在中國××人道的××行為，和中國軍民一最抵抗兩略的英　戰　。並且，李蒙夫婦還以十二萬　的全誠深信中國必然取得最後的　利。海南島事件發生以後，李蒙　寫過一篇「海南島　　遠東的整個局勢。」在　篇論文裏，他明確地指出「祇有中國的勝利才是遠東和平與太平洋安全的保障。」是的，不單以中法兩國同為酷愛自由，和平獨立……等美德的民族性講同，就是以外交利害上，地　關聯上講，中法吻國是應當密切携手的。在歐洲，從法郎哥在西班牙得勢之後，法國已陷於法西斯勢方的　圍之中，東邊要受德意志的威脅，東南有希特拉的盟兄弟索墨尼　等待着機會，南面地中海更是密布着法西斯侵略者的勢力，西南則為德意的走狗法郎哥在　吠。在北菲的　蘭西莫洛哥，亦處處受德意勢力的打擊。地中海上的西西里亞島（Simlia　lland）私巴　拉里亞島（Pintellaria　lland）更給了土尼斯（Lnnig）無限的煩惱。在遠東，從日本撕毀了一九〇七年生日關於海南島问題的協定而實行武裝佔領以來，已摧毀了整個安南的安全保障。這是多麼使人驚訝的消忽，在日本佔領海南島後不到兩天的功夫，日本竟向法國提出索取海南島西北的巴爾西爾島（Panracels　Iennd）的新要求—同時，我們知道暹　與日本是有着　種的秘密臨定的。一旦有事，安　豈不服背受敵。故正如李輩所說一攤：『現在該是我們深切覺悟，　情眞正　實的時　了，他瞥我們希望自遠東建築多少海軍機空軍的根据地，但是能真正阻止日令侵略　南，菲列濱，香港，新加坡，而企圖操縱遠東和太平洋的唯一可靠力量還無過於中國的勝利和獨立。無疑地，中法兩國的結合是促進世界和平大動力之一。我相信，中法兩國的大多數民衆已有了這樣的深切信任。所剩下來的工作就是怎機加强宣傳據大影響，使每一個法蘭西人民都能深刻了解中國抗戰的兩途　是光明，祇有勝利！把日本帝國主義在巴黎的宣傳材料一概丟到馬桶裏去。所以，我們歡迎。中國之友』到中國來，他們必然會得到滿魚的？印象，懂得中華民族眞止偉大的力量！</p>
<p>中國的抗戰是長期的，是反侵略的，是以弱國　強兵的，是革命的，因此，我們須要全世界廣大愛好和平的人民羣衆的同情與援助。同時，我們更堅决相信，國際輿論必然是傾向我們的，不獨英美法蘇各大國裏的民衆如此，就是遠東和近東的許多小國吏在急切地期望着中國內勝付，把中國當做他們生存的救星，据最近回國的囘敎近東考察團的代表馬天英說：『印度，埃及，阿富汗，依關，以及近東的一切國家他們全少已舉行過七次『中國日』。他們渴望着關於中國抗戰的消息，他們等待着歡迎每一个到近東去的中國人。可是，我們到那邊去的人實在太少，供給關於　戰的消息實在多，而日本人却無孔不入地　做宣傳，在不衛地向囘敎人民討好……』是的。我要黨復說一句，我們已傳得了全世界人民的廣大同情。此地所　下來的工作，就是怎樣溝通　絡和增進他們對於中國實際狀况的了解就是了！所以，我們熱烈接　費全世界的『中國之　』到中國，　他們把中國抗戰的勇史　，散佈到全世界去，同時，我們不能忘記中日戰爭的世界性，日本軍閥的瘋狂行動，不，倒不如說是網際法西斯的侵略行為，决不單是和四萬萬伍千萬中國人民為敵，而是準備控制全世界的開端。故中日戰爭將有可能消變為人類最後的屠殺。在這戰爭過程中，整個世界政治，經濟文化，將步入空前的劇變，而接近於人類最後的　得光听。所以，中日戰爭决不是局限於東方的問題，而是深刻地必然會去牽動坐世界。因此，為了反應這大時　的環境須要，國際新聞從業目的團結運動應該汛速地開履和堅強底建立起來。然而，不可否認的，不但和國外，就是和在中國的外國記者，我們也還沒有一個密切的聯繋，還沒取得很好的合作。這一次記者和李　一起從華南到西北，幾乎定　了整個戰中國。為了提　國人對於這問題的注意，為了促進進運動的發展，所以，願把李　夫　在中國的情形，做個簡略的記錄。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>何以〔和〕為</h3>
<p>— 老訥</p>
<p>—難民的悲痛語—</p>
<p>我是華北的難民，向來從事教育工作多年。自因平津淪陷携眷南邊，難轉祇港，業經年餘，因為不通粵語，對於　友談心，稍爲困難，鎭日悶坐斗室，殊感寂寞，所藉以消遺者，惟賴閱報耳。不　日前　到，本港××日報。登載呆先生發表一篇論文，標題為，『舉一個例』，不勝詫異，私心甚為感動，且極惶惑。本想保存該報，以便詳細要求其用意功在，不意竞爲幼兒撕毀，無法冉行　譯原文。逐句研討。好在是。其原文的大意，料已傳遍令港，無待詳述。敝人原本愛敬某先生的愚忱，不揣冒昧，僅有所請敎。</p>
<p>查某先生誚，『主和爲我對於國事的主張了』。又曰，『我已經應該盡其最大的努力，以求主張　實限。』</p>
<p>敝人不知，和主與投降，有何區別，更與屈服，有何以異。若求和而不畏權辱國，且既和之後，而不名存實亡，仍復領土主權，依然完整。則和國　不可者。然面試問，某先生果能有把握辦得到否。</p>
<p>若和而領土主權不能完整，結果，喪樣辱國，名存而實亡。即主和者為利國耶，為鍋國耶。請某先生平心解氣，濟夜捫心。革命奮鬥數十年，為個人升官發財計耶。抑亦爲我先　無遺　所述，『致力國民革命凡一十年，其目的在求中國之自由平等』耶。</p>
<p>又查某先生曰，我所誠心誠意以求者，在為東亞自年長治久安大社，中日兩國，戰則兩敗　傷，和則共同生存。</p>
<p>噫嘻，中日兩戰國，戰則兩敗俱傷，此言誠是也。但試問戰端果由我啓耶？侵略無止境，我固應束手待斃，不加以抵抗耶？</p>
<p>又　人大惑不解者。『和則共同生存』。試問何謂國家，其定義非以領土，人民，主權，三個要件完整為嚴格的規定乎。假使祇有領土人民，而具主權不復完整。則為名存而實亡。朝鮮廣國矣，而具土地依然存在，人民依然生存。特主權喪失耳。和了之後，對方固能生存，而我仍能生存耶。所謂共同生存者，不知作何解釋。</p>
<p>吾揣料某先生的原意，大約以為，我國實力　池抵抗　的結果，恐更不利，不如暫時忍辱言和，姑且保存實力，等候機會，徐圖恢復。</p>
<p>此種看法，亦有一部份理由。然而試問，對方是否，舉國上下，盡皆　　，允許我養精銳，待時而勤，而不預加防範，置我死地乎耶耶。</p>
<p>又音具後段結論，頗負有先見之明。以爲當今之世，捨我具誰。查×强我弱，　　皆知。犧牲重大，早經預料。然而舉國上下，一致决心，抗戰到底，寗為玉碎，不求瓦全者。實以吾國數千年來，孔敢精神，『是知其不可而爲之者也』『所欲有甚於生者，所惡有甚於死者』若人皆效法　先生，預知戰亦必敬，不如首先求和。則是文犬祥，史可法誠誠為多串，愚不可及，而秦檜，及洪承疇，為識時　的俊　者矣。禮　廉恥。忠孝節發，八個大字，尙當保存異　。</p>
<p>因氣節二字，而連想及於　居北平之失勢軍人失某者，窘困無以爲生。×方日夜包圍。威迫利誘，千方百計，勸其出山。而吳某倔强不屈。以反革命著稱之窮厄軍人，而有當貴不能淫，貧踐不能移，威武不能屈之氣概。而以革命起家，位極權重之黨國偉人，而竟順風駛船，首先屈膝，此誠咄咄怪事，革命先革心，孔子曰，始吾於人也，聽聽其言而信其行，今吾於人也，聽其言樂觀其行，口是心非，言偽而辦，自古有之，於今爲烈。</p>
<p>又查某先生曰，共產黨好搗亂。</p>
<p>以敝人所聞，來自北方之難胞，均謂第八路軍，在淪陷內，作遊擊戰並紀律甚好，與人民合作，狄毫不犯。並月拋棄階級門　口號，對於本地之富商良紳，一律保護，不寧惟是，對于外國傳敎神甫牧師，亦均妥加保護，絕不似上年的反宗教大盟之精神，（反對神權宗敎）。則共產黨搗亂之說，不知竟何所　耶　倘以反對主和　主張抗戰，為搗亂，則欲加之罪，何患無詞，反對主和者，又豈僅共產黨耶。卽今年餘，毫無信息，生死莫卜，存亡不知，而二子從軍，半載無信，兩姪從軍，業經陣亡，悲慘之傷，　夜失眠，驪泊香　，借債　活，極欲戰事早日結束，冀得旋　耘田，免致　死異鄉。然而猶忍痛苦支，不欲聞屈聞之和聲，則知人同此心，心同此理，反對主和者，實不慬共產黨矣。抑敝人所謂物生　愚，不達是務者，深　國事端在人為。苟今日要人，多有幾個文天祥，陸秀夫，史可法，則前途尙有好轉的希望。宋明之亡，實由當時君！臣貪，民愚無嵌，不知亡國之慘，視改朝換帝常事。而今日則上有英明果斷，堅苦　絕，之天材領袖，而下有覺悟犧牲，視死如歸，之熱血　士，舉國一致，之民族意識，此與宋明末季，逈乎不同者，並且今世國際關係，錯綜複雜，雖　外援不可專事依賴，然而亦不無增加助力，就廿餘閱月之戰事經驗，我方將七勇的犧牲，勇氣不為不大，而所羞　者，似為武器　及人，茍我方軍艦，飛機，人炮，與對方較，不大懸殊者，則　後勝利，尤有把握，故目前要在加緊組織訓練，使軍事，政治，敎育，經濟建設，諸多方面，皆能進步到現代化　程度，卽是科學化的程度，則戰局好轉，對方知難而退，屆時雙方誠意誠心，圖謀東亞百年長治久安，或者易於　現要之能戰然後　和，若不能戰，絕不能和，某先生於廣州，武漢，兩繼淪陷之後，而唱和議，目言，兩國人士相與努力，則又可謂，識時務者爲俊傑矣？革命分烈犧牲者，前綫將士犧牲者，後方民衆犧牲者，假使死而有知，不知作何感想。</p>
<h3>救救香港的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 朱奇卓</p>
<p>假如說香港有一百萬人口，兒童是佔四分之一的話，那麼，香港的兒童就有二百五十萬這個偌大的數目。</p>
<p>這二百五古萬的兒童過着什麼生活呢？</p>
<p>——賣報，擦皮，做苦工，當奴役，流浪……在　餓線上跑　　痛的欺凌，過着黑無天日的生涯，讓黃金般的童年像　風，如泡影，無蹤無跡地幻痕過去，這是一個多麼　痛的現實！</p>
<p>所謂『幸福』的兒童又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>——托家庭所感　的，是『拜金』和『封建』的思想薰陶；還有的是「麻將教育一以及崎形家庭制度的習染。</p>
<p>在　牢式的學校校？有的是老帥的叱罵與挨打，還有一奪聽不懂，吃不消的『說敎』。</p>
<p>什麼「古文」！什麼「英文」！………把一串古人與大人的『東西』，裝進稚弱的腦袋，加上老帥『認眞的管敎』，今天要默寫，明天要背誦，使兒童純潔的靈魂蓋上一重黑影，偉大的創造力受釗嚴　的打擊而宣告夭折，「幸福」的兒童雖然幸免物質生活的威脅，精神上的虐殺，亦　够受了！</p>
<p>——這樣的兒童，就是我們未來的主人翁，就是希望能够接續我們這一代的脚步來建國的未來主人翁，這樣的主人翁怎不四人不塞而慄呢？</p>
<p>二十世紀是兒童的世紀；兒童的好壞决定了民族盛衰的命運。×人搶走了我們的兒童，我們越是要，受我們的兒童。『救救我們的小朋友』，亦該是當前的急務　。</p>
<p>在整個社會制度來得改變之前，我們當然亦不敢奢望兒童問題能明　圓滿的解決，可是，亦儘有很多搶救兒童的方法，在此時，在此地　能够做得到，動應該立卽發動起來的：</p>
<p>一　請老師放下鞭子</p>
<p>『體罰』說據是香港一般學校普遍的現象。老帥手上的「鞭子」從「敎具」變成「刑具」了。為什麼要毆打稚弱的孩子呢？除了「野　」「粗暴的發洩之外，是沒有自由可以自圓具說的。</p>
<p>執行體罰的遞詞或者說是「使好兒童加勉，壞兒童裝知戒」。事實上，真有「加勉」與「知戒一的效果否？這個，執行體罰者自己知道得最明白，稍有良心的敎師，或父母，體罰兒童之後，是無不深深懊悔的。「加勉」與「　戒」自有其他的敎育方法可以遵循，時至今日，絕不能再使用「體罰」的未策了。敎育部的　除體罰研究報告，是集合全國專家與進步學校，進步敎帥研究實驗的結晶，是無論任何一個敎育兒童　所應精讀而力行的鑒本，政府對於禁止體罰的三令五申蔆亦是每　學校，每個敎師應該絕對運從的法令。</p>
<p>固執成見面壞脾氣不能克服者或者板起臉孔，　出似是而非的理由來抗議：「理論是這麼說，却不知道事實困的難—有些小孩，有時候實在是非打不可」！可是，是筆者在兒童隊伍裏過活了好多年頭，事實上却並　如此感覺，能够實行人格感化，循　　誘的敎育先進亦不知道多少！筆者的為兒童請命，誠怨希　「體罰有用　」者虛心下氣，觀摩一下進步的教師是怎樣對待兒意。是怎樣得到精神上的慰　，再讀一讀敎育部的　止體罰研究報告，究研可不可以實行。那時候，一定會毅然决然，「放下鞭子，立刻成爲良帥的，如還是固執「非體罰不可的話，那麼，自己總得坦白承認：「是自己沒有辦法致小孩」，却不是「小孩非打不可」。</p>
<p>體罰兒童對於兒童生理心理的推　　實太淺　了！救救小孩　一先要滅絕兒童最大的敵人！鞭子，無知的父母或者未能普遍做得到，『請老帥放下鞭子』應該不成問題的吧？</p>
<p>二　別教那些小朋友聽不懂的東西</p>
<p>小朋友解脫了鞭子的刑罰之後，接着，就要希望老師們前敎那些小朋友聽不懂的東西。像「奧妙」的「古文」與「　文」……眞要敎小朋友越讀越糊涂。兒童本位教育是什麼意思？課程標準告訴我們　什麼？老師們是千萬不可懊人子弟，而動畏了民族　機的，敎授古文與英文說是「適　環境」　，這固然亦有其舌喪，但是，「遠應」應該有一個　度啊！而且，「適應瓊環境」並不是敎育最　的目的，而　。「改造環境」的手段，白可能殺人，粉　殺人不見血更是可怕刃，操粉　者應該怎樣　　將事才是！敎師亦好像手上操着一把刀，是把身邊的小孩殺死，還是被開一條生路　小孩前進，這是要敎師自己去决定的。深願我們的敎師救救我們的小朋友吧！</p>
<p>三　來一個兒童精神糧食運動</p>
<p>小朋友有的是好奇心與旺盛的求知慾。學校刻板無味的　科書一定是不能滿足兒童的要求的。要求沒有進步的敎師指導閣讀有益的兒童讀物，無疑　就會往「連環畫」鑽進去。中了「連環圖」之毒，在目前已是普遍的現象，亦是嚴重的問題，這個惡劣的影響，眞要叫有心人痛心疾首呢！</p>
<p>針對着這　嚴重的事實，很需要來一個兒童精神糧食運動，凡是進步的敎師，作家·畫家·報界·應該責無旁貨地聯合起來　這　　被人疏忍而包含着重大意義的運　，除將原有的兒童出版物　原見兒童指連圖體，以充質與强化之外，如兒童日報，兒童畫　，新連環圖，兒童定刊物，兒童　等等都應該有嶄新的姿態出現、使着大的兒童，得到了新鮮的，進步的精神食糧。</p>
<p>四　讓兒童在集體中生長起來</p>
<p>兒童不是父母的私　物，亦不是可以獨佔的玩偶，他該是屬於　會的，屬於國家民族的。因此，他需要在集體之中生長起來。</p>
<p>新安旅行團，上海孩子劇團，廈門兒童劇團……這些前進的兒童團體　然在集體的苦門中表現了驚人的成續，本港的兒童保育　，學賑曾的兒童團，未嘗不是兒童的大集團，要是强化起來，將小知曾發生多大的作用。深願各校敎師與學　會負責　不辭辛苦地使全港九的兒童都在兒童團統一領導之下。過　集體的生活、在集體之中　長，兒童團在過去已　了不少的兒童工作，有了光榮的歷史，今後除了應該再進一步展開集體主　的讀　運動，健康運動，救國運動……之外，還須進行小先　制度，使學校兒童負起應負的日務來敎育　坊的！苦兒童，並與本港英國兒童以及國內國外的兒童朋友聯絡起來，團結起來，這是一摟多麼饒有意　的運動呢！</p>
<p>本港的英國兒童朋友已經與兒童保育院兒童　友像　携手起來了；摧行小兒童制在組國亦是風行一時的運動；全國，全世界的兒童通訊，　國立中央大學實　學校倡導之下，亦有了先例，希望香港的兒童在　國抗戰的炮聲中亦警惕起來，趕上偉大　　前進，祖國亦　需要着這樣的主人翁。</p>
<p>救救小朋友的範圍　很廣乏的；上面　枝人　說的四點只不過是此時此地應該着手，可能着　的起碼　作　了。這點小小意見是很平凡的：亦　會因為「拋磚」而「引玉」吧。作者最不揣淺陋而　　出來者，動機只是任此。深顯我們小朋友在大時代的怒　中救了起來。</p>

<p>（二）×人在中國各方面的新攻勢、徒自破壞、其「長期戰爭計劃」必不能達其决戰之目的、結果將逼得使×人陷入泥渾之脚、愈陷　深、這是一、</p>
<p>（三）在財政經濟上、×人因爲時而採用短距離賽跑的原則、卽更中軍需品生產的原則、時而採　長　離的　　原則、卽一面　加　需生產一面增加一般生產原則、　得氣喘吁吁、資　日疲、「長斯建設」固不可能、集中軍需生產之部、亦難更施、公路滯銷、節約無法、結果只有走上極端的　通貨膨性的　路途、而使整個空前財政經濟、發半空前的大破綻、整個人民生計日益困苦、　　空氣日盛讒　、這是三、</p>
<p>（四）×人在外交軍　及財政經濟各方面、俱陷入絕境之時、這個時候、或者就在本年　天、那時、×人方面的革命的變化或　多數人所　像的那樣、發生於在華一大敗仗之後、或各國　攻之後、而竟意外的發生於在華前綫、因而呈現歷史十所未曾有的悲慘的末路、這是西、</p>
<p>以上便是將來×人在它的末路上大致難免的表演、（完）</p>
<h3>淪陷一年餘之太原</h3>
<p>— 忠口述　昇平筆記</p>
<p>【民革社　　通訊】我伴着一個義民，在　出發前的一個體拜，我　沒有洗臉和刷牙，當出發的那犬，我穿上了在鄉下借來的布衣，布鞋，布樣·頭上照樣的纒了一塊布，腰間也仍然緊　着一條布帶，我剛裝扮好，同志們都拍掌大笑，「眞像，眞像」，他們在爲我喝彩，有的同志又來和我握手說：「保險你沒有問題」，圍在同志的歡送中，我曾上了　牲口的鞭子，現着一隻毛　出發了。我在路上走了三天，才釗太原城郊，泣別快到一年的故鄉，今日又重現子眼前。此時我萬感父集，而又恐被識破。只好沉　氣不住的　着　向城而走。忽然一個沉車的東西打在我的臂上，把我吃了一驚，急忙掉轉頭去，「呀——」只見一個拖着一輛自行車的日本兵眼睛鷄蛋大，　　　在不斷的向着我吼，我明白　他的意思，急忙將驢住一邊趕，他才騎上車過去了。他　的，我根本就不知道地在後面，也沒有聽着　響，當時因了任務在身，只得忍氣吞聲。</p>
<p>到了城門口，見一個警察，和兩個日本兵正站任城的兩旁。餓狗似的眼睛，在不斷的向准城的人身掃射。我這時很沉着的走到了城門邊，照樣的給兩個日本兵做了一個鞠躬體（進城如果不給日本兵敬禮，不但不能進城，反而要遭受毒打），進了城，剛走了幾步，後面忽發出一種粗的聲音　叫「站住」，我以為在　我，急　轉頭去看，原來是在呌起我後面的一位靑年男子，這使我吃了一驚，當時走在中上，內心尙在忐怎的跳動。</p>
<p>到太原後，我住在一親戚家裏，他們告訴我去年日本××進太原後竟　整的搶掠四十天，城內城外殺死老百姓四千餘名，家裏比較好一些的器具，都被他們刦掠一空。</p>
<p>現在太原城內，除一些小買賣已開始營業外，其餘大的宇號仍沒有開門，至于各商店的經營，大半都有日本人參加。名義上雖稱中日合辦，實際上一切權利都操在日人手裏，中國人只敢怒而不敢言。</p>
<p>駐太原的日兵，隨時都在調動，時　來，時而去，最多的時候也不過三四千人，有時竟調走得所剩無幾。市面治安由日共和　警維持，表面上好像很淸凈，實際上却危機四伏，非常恐　，隔不多　，×人又在謂　戶口，其原因，不是　有共產黨擾亂，便是說有抗日份子，暗地活動，因此當有　辜良民，被拖去槍斃了！　原城內，有很多日本婦女，他們都是才從國內來的，一　份公開實淫，此餘　在市　上開設酒館茶館大烟店等買賣，這　舉動，一面無非想麻醉我同胞，另一面則進行其間諜工作。</p>
<p>城內的幾個娛樂場，均已更名營業，例如：柳巷的中華電影院，現已改爲中日電影院，×人的宣撫班，成天不斷的在各娛樂場或街上，大肆宣傳，利用各種漫藎樣語、進行其淆惑聽聞挑撥離間和侮辱我抗戰領袖，他這種無恥已極的舉動，實不堪一笑。</p>
<p>現在太原的偽省長，爲　綏遠財政廳長蘇體仁。陽曲縣縣長現為亨達利　錶店的老板姚伯璋，據說姚的璋的前任，是個賣古　的商人。他剛接任三天就自殺了。原因是日本××壓迫他，一定要他作陽曲縣長，他不願做×人的走狗，出賣組國，一冉推辭不掉，接任後請神七倍加痛苦，因　接什後第三日　服　自殺。各偽組織的內部，除少數是域官僚和軍閥外，其餘多半是些商人，這些商人中有少數是廿願做　奸，大多數則因被迫个得已才做的。</p>
<p>太原附近我游擊隊非常活躍，城郊時常有個別的日本兵和漢奸被我便衣隊解决，夫年十月十六日的那天，便發生兩件襲擊×人的事件。</p>
<p>×人所佔據的正太同蒲兩鐵路線，不斷的遭我游擊隊的破壞與襲擊，因此乘客寥　無幾，各軍站開車的時間，也時常　時，各公路線也是司機的情況，襲車破路，均使×人苦惱萬分，各鐵路統和公路綫，×人雖有鐵路隊往來保護，但是終因兵力有限，怎能處處防得周到？</p>
<p>近來×人在太原正施行其奴化敎育的機關，就是所謂新民小　，×人要每家的學齡兒童逃這學　裏去唸書，學費書藉費均不必　納。可是多數的同胞，都不願將自己小孩送去，但又怕×人强迫，因此將他們的孩子送　鄉下去。城內各偽機關與學校　頂，都挿　太陽旗和五色旗，我每次見　這些旗子，心中就發出無限的憤怒！</p>
<p>太原的同胞，在×人　蹄下，已一年多了。他們無時無刻不在盼　國　的到來。當他們問到我「國軍何時才能打回來」？我心　感到無　的酸痛，於是我將國軍在各戰場英勇抗×的情形，詳細　　他們他們每個人都被　動得流涕。有的咬着牙關，揑緊拳頭，幾乎要怒吼！要咆哮！當時有位同志低聲說：「我們耐心的幹下去，那個時候，已經不遠了！」</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>四邑救鄕運動</h3>
<p>江門戰　展開以夾、台，新，恩，開四邑及中山鶴　等邑，情勢突轉緊急，入港各邑商員，現已先後發起救運動，四邑商工總局，已於昨日成立賬　，中山商　亦足的今日會商救濟雌民，鶴山商會則派代表四人返邑急　，而新會　會。並已發電向　　華僑　籲救組！</p>
<p>目前救鄉運動最重要的任務，消權方面是募捎籌賑，精極方面是動同民眾保術家鄕。</p>
<p>首先關於　　籌賑，我們　意　獻蔥議者，第一是要有計劃有　織地；僚可成的統一進行；第二，主要之人，不僅浪對抗戰建國有緊強信心，並須有有高尙的人格與　潔的品性。為政　及地方民從及僑胞所　領；第三，捐得錢物。不會鉅　，均須有合法的公佈，且須存放於成實銀行：第四，欵　之運用，必須急其所急。而事務上所需，務求其　少。</p>
<p>其次，關於賑濟難民災童，我們認爲：除了消極的搶救以外，必须重注重於積極的救助，卽須實施難民談童的收容，組織，和教育，使廣大難民災童，能盡其心力以供獻給抗戰救鄉建國的偉大事業。</p>
<p>至於　員民眾保衛家鄉，更是目前階段最緊要的工作，第一，在內地，應該在政府當局領導之下，普遍實施國民精神動員綱領，儘可能的展開政治動員工作，以　在×人未來之時，得收軍民協力擊退×人之功；卽×人臨境之時，亦可從容佈置疏　及游擊工作，不致有紛亂逃難轉輾死亡的現象。不過要實現這一點就必須進民主政治的實現，地方民意機關　建立，動員機構和下層政治機構的改進，民衆生活之合出的改善等等。第二，在海外，各僑胞團體及各界熱心愛國份子，除了努力每捎籌賑　作以外，尤應加緊發動少壯有爲的僑胞，回國返鄉服務。要實現這一點，則僑民國統一陣綫，必須　使鞏固與發展，大家摒除畛域或成見，共信互信，互讓互助</p>
<p>國父中山生的故鄉，已在×人飛機兵　的威脅之下了，我們每一個廣東同鄉中國同胞，都應以十字　實行百年義　以保衛聖地　　神，來　　我們國父的故鄕，來保搧我軍自已的田園廬舍工廠商店和一切產業！</p>
<h3>阿爾巴尼亞一瞥</h3>
<p>— 董平</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>莫索里尼吞下了阿比西尼亞眼見，有點消化不良，得不償失，於是乎乃把目光了個四十五度，現在又想打阿爾巴尼亞的主義來了。自然，這原不是偶然的書，一切自有其歷史背景與當前環境的橷托。</p>
<p>軸心國家的陰謀；永遠是一拉一唱；在世界舞台上，迭成張弛不定的局勢。記得，當時大利侵略阿比西尼亞的時候，各國一致　擊，紛紛主張制成，逼莫索里尼不得不略爲斂跡，可是，這邊才歇，立刻；希特勒便乘時崛起進兵萊茵，撕毀凡劇壽的一串。這種情形相互演遞一直到今日，德國給民主國家的反德陣綫，圍困著不得不略　退讓的當兒，意大利又來了。最低的限度，迫得令張怕倫又忙上一陣。</p>
<p>局勢的前途，已漸漸展開：可兒我們願奪供給一點阿爾巴尼亞的資料，以爲展望前途參攷。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>阿爾已尼亞位在巴爾幹半　的西境。面積約廣一萬七千餘方哩，她東北面　南斯拉夫所圍抱，南隣希臘，西瀕亞得里亞　，與意大利隔海相望，相距只有八十五哩。</p>
<p>全國大部是崎嶇的山地，與深壑的溪流，不原很少，僅有沿濱的狹長一片。土地倒并不如想像的枮瘠只因為阿爾巴尼亞的向來不務耕種，才弄成遍　荒無。他們的傳統聯業是游牧，現在慢慢向手工業方面走。</p>
<p>阿爾馬尼亞是一個挺年輕的國家，在一九一三年第一巴爾幹戰爭之後，才建立起來的。遠在九世　的時候，那地力是比利時的勢力，至十五世紀，才　土耳其攫去統治。相沿四五百年以下，直到一九一三年的第一次巴兩幹戰爭，在奧匈帝國的聲援之下，得以宜佈獨立，正式國建，由德國的威廉親干担任國王。</p>
<p>大戰爆發，四隣紛紛侵人，國內陷於紛亂快態。英　三國且吋訂下秘密協定，瓜分阿國。至一九一七年，意國卽藉　派軍開人阿國，令阿人組織共和國，歸意大和保護。一九二〇年，往聖密會議，正式　認意大利的保護權，但到九二五年，各國又公認阿兩巴尼亞為獨立共和國；可是至一九二六年，又改成意大利的保　國　最後，到一九三八年，意法你改，改為王國，原任總統查格，改稱國王。同時、又　取消了意大利的保護權。</p>
<p>雖然這保護權，是變來變去的　個停，但實　上，阿國的一切，實與意人利保護國無異，國人的一切富源鑛機　都在意大利手裏。軍政大權都在箱顯願問的手裏。這樣，意國要有所舉動。阿國是很難有辦法的。所以，消　傳來，阿王原　預備投降的，但現在有英法的撐腰了，也許能有一點辦法，但倫敦能鞭畏得及嗎？　（未完）</p>

<h3>粉碎投降屈服的漢奸理論　新生的中國（下）</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>王瑩女士在女青年會演講</p>
<p>上面說的是前線與鄉間的情形、現在就說一段我們剛　經過的城市吧：</p>
<p>廣西已經動員五十多萬士兵上前線了；繼續還可以動員到二百多萬呢。女同胞在廣西非常活躍，開店子，做工夫，女壯丁訓練，一切看到的都是女子英勇苦幹的　態。</p>
<p>學生軍在廣西，亦是够偉大了，正當廣洲武，失守，悲觀，動搖　失敗主義情緒　漫一時的時候，廣西學生軍原來擬招收一千二百名的，可是報名應考者，一來就是一萬　千人。你要是對他或地說，「你年紀太小吧」！他會瞞著你，「不—我十八歲了—我二十歲了！」這樣一個堅決的答覆。</p>
<p>他們在受訓的時候　很切實地在寅習作戰，煞有其事地如臨大　。</p>
<p>公務員方面，亦是很　潔的。每人一套布衣服，薪水很薄，精神却非常可佩。</p>
<p>……痛恨漢奸的商人</p>
<p>商人之痛恨漢奸，說來更是有趣。有一次，我們有一位團員上店子買火藥去，準備表演「台兒莊之戰」當炮火用的。　知道這位商人叫我們這位同志稍候，他靜悄悄地去通知一羣警察來把他抓去了—說他要不是漢奸，幹麼要買火藥　經過冉三的解釋，被抓去的同志才釋放出來，可這位商人還是不信。用　不靈的火藥賣給我們。當在舞台上　不起火來的時候，眞把我們急死了！翌日再親身上門說個底細，請他來看肴戲，他才恍然知道這是爲着救國的，就連忙送來了很多眞的火藥了，這樣捅恨漢奸的愛國商人，多麼　人感動的—這種老百姓進步的事實，又何曾不是千千萬萬中之一呢！</p>
<p>被×人瘋狂的轟　，桂林是最慘酷的了。屋宇化爲瓦礫頺垣的，亦足足三分佔其二。可是，應西的民衆沉着應變，×機來的時候，就跑到山洞裏去。×機去了，便從一片焦土中，檢出一些可用的用具出來，蓋起蘆蓆的棚子來，二三天之後，又是恢復着營業，不僅不會動搖信念，沒有悲觀情緒。而且加强×愾同仇的怒火。至於商業，則是照常的繁榮，這種繁榮，不是都市的繁榮，而是象徵中國有着無限希望的繁榮。</p>
<p>……可歌可感的空軍將士</p>
<p>談到軍隊，最進步的就是空軍。我有很多朋友是當空軍的，亦時常在一起，所以，知道得很詳細。他們個個都健壯，個個都英男。在衡陽的時候，會經以一架飛機敵二十七架×機之衆，結果還打落×機二架，自己才受　降下來。</p>
<p>當到了最危險的時候，他不願跳傘逃生，却偏偏要和×機相碰，使之同歸於盡。當他們出發炸×艦的時候，是立好了遺囑，用自己的身軀，用自己的飛機，英勇地向×艦推毀，以壯烈的犧牲，給×人看看我們中華民族的靈魂。</p>
<p>在洛陽的時候，曾看到我航空人員將起　追擊×機的時候，他們個倘人沒有表情，只有沉默。這種沉　，不是悲哀的沉默，而是　决的沉默。他們不說話，內心已决定一去就不來了。</p>
<p>……將士的樂觀</p>
<p>從軍事的全局看來，我們軍隊的質量都有突飛的進步。</p>
<p>在前線的時候，時常看到士兵在空襲的時候，就躺在草堆裏睡一下，×　去了，又是抬着機關槍一面定，一面唱歌，有說有笑，顯出非常樂觀的神態。假如有人對我們前線的士兵與民衆說是要與×人講和的，他立刻就要遭到無情的打擊。只要有到前線的情形，講和的話一定就說不出來，中國的雄步，的的確確非親身看過，是不會柑信的。</p>
<p>……廣州武漢失守後的戰局</p>
<p>武漢廣州失守在表面上看來，我們是很困難的，其實，唯其失守，我們才從被動的地位轉變爲自動的地位：在失守前，我們要堵積着很多　力在一個中心點等候×人優勢的炮火來猛攻，現在呢，我們要攻　一點，×人就要在那一點來應戰，弄得他泥足深人，不知何以自；了×人佔領的城市，是絕對沒有辦法走出十里地或二十里地的地方，這是很多城市千眞萬確的事實。</p>
<p>有很多城市，我們全體軍民撤退了，就讓×人進入，然後四方八面把×人包圍起來，弄得×人深感困難，要是×軍援兵趕到的詁。　就形成了拉鋸的狀態。有一些人聽了失一城池就頺喪悲觀，這完全是不知實情的緣故，我們所爭的，不是點與綫，而是整個的面，爭取全面抗戰的勝利，必須不分男女老少，不分南北東西，軍事，政治，經濟，文化，都要全面抗戰。</p>
<p>……日暮途窮的×人</p>
<p>×人的迷夢最初是不戰而勝，經我戰而不屈之後，就改爲速戰速決了。經我堅持抗戰之後，就改爲速和速决了。再經找抗戰到底之嚴正打擊之後，就奢談什麼百年大戰，來撑撑面子。這就是×人精疲力竭的象徵。我們這一戰，不把×人　出領土，是絕對不會停止的。把×人趕出領土，亦是絕對有可能的。</p>
<p>……貢獻一切給祖國</p>
<p>最末，我要用一個故事來做結束：在法國，有一個玩把戲的跟傳道師到二個　處的禮拜堂去，這個玩把戲的就任禮堂拚命地　觔斗，玩戰法，傳道師問他何以要這樣幹？他很得意地說：我沒有別的本領貢献給上帝看，有的，只有我這本行的翻觔斗，玩把戲而已，藉以表現他對於上帝至誠至會的敬意。</p>
<p>像這個故事一樣，我自己就是以戲劇來獻給祖國。諸位亦同樣的，各人有各人的崗位，可以爲祖國效勞。</p>
<p>我們這次來到香港的時候，時常聽到一些朋友說：「我們在香港慚愧極了、眞是比不上你們在前綫服務」。其實，在香港工作亦是同樣的重要。苦幹的同志，我們亦是正常感佩的。再見。</p>
<p>——全體很感動地跟着「再見」而散會。可是還像依依不捨似的。這些例，是沽生生的例，不是汪精簡替近衛所舉的『例』。興奮，感動，佔領着個人的心情，積極支配着每個人今後的行爲。　（續完）</p>

<h3>婦女兵災會昨在京都酒店　歡迎中國救亡劇團　是同志的會面，工作的會面！</h3>
<p>— 夥兮</p>
<p>昨天下午三時，香港中國婦女乓災會茶會歡迎中國救亡劇團全團團員。他們二十四個人（還有幾位因事未到）有男，有女，有小孩，還有參加過抗戰的將官，個個都看了整潔而　素的新裝，精神飽滿地準時到會。</p>
<p>地點是在京都酒店六樓的大禮堂，亦是一個　精緻的舞廳，　士　的樂具還安置在中央的壇上呢。在來自前線的工作者的日象中這與前線生　慣了的破屋茅舍，簡而是另　個世界。但是，在主人的意念中，却滿以爲　　團的同志們舒適一下。休息一下，還不能略表慰勞的微忱呢。</p>
<p>婦女兵　會主人有十多位，劇團二十四位　歡迎佳賓外，還有文化界和電影戲劇界名流　楚生李建　等十多位來賓。大家圍着長方形的桌子。主席劉慶萱　士很誠地　致詞：</p>
<p>「自我們神聖××以來二十個月，無論前綫後方，凡　我們中華民族優秀的兒女，和不願做亡國奴的人們，都一致起來參加××，努力各種救亡工作，這說明我們中華民族是永不會滅亡，更說明我們××最後勝利終屬于我們的。這次中國滅亡劇團，爲擴大宣傳及爲前方將士呼籲起見，决意出國宣傳，道經香港，我們得接李宗仁白崇禧兩將軍來函介紹，更深認識該　和該團之止　團長：金山先十，王瑩女士，及廣　學生軍團長林樞先生，是最英勇的及　努力的一羣工作者。將來出　宣傳。更必有不可量的收效。我們除了欽佩感奮之外，更希望我們努力同心，一致團結起來，冗相合作，早日完成××建城的偉大任務。</p>
<p>主席致詞後，就請劇團團長金山先生演講，並請　浮光生繙譯爲廣州話：</p>
<p>「我們未到香港之前就久仰香港中國婦女兵　會愛國的熱忱了。李白二將軍　說過你們的努力。　發奎將軍這次派一架救護車，把我們從韶關運到潮安，這架大車，就是婦女兵災會的捐贈品。使我們又慚愧，又幸慰。在此應該表示謝意。</p>
<p>『我　這一次的會面，是同志的會面，工作的會面。我們這一次出國宣傅，是預定的一貫計劃，抗戰不勝利，我們的工作是不待停止的。這次逗留香港從事整理與準備的時間雖然只有一二個月，但是，在　裏　們亦不放棄我們的責任。如果婦女兵災會和　他的救亡團體要我們做，麼工作，我們一定盡力去做，因爲我們的任務是同一個日標的。</p>
<p>「我們此次出國的目的第一是要把一年多來的活生生經歷告訴友邦，說明中國絕對不會亡的：告訴僑胞，說明他們歷次的　於　錢出力，是絕對不會白費的，將來一定得到報酬的。</p>
<p>第二，是要發動更多的僑胞　躍輸將，　欵囘國辦理　兵病院，數護　等車業。所以我說與婦女兵　會同志會面是同志的會面，工作的會面，是很　當的，以後，我們願在工作上多多發生聯系。」</p>
<p>金山先生寅講的是林樞先生，他用　州話說：『我們在前　得到婦女團體贈送的棉背　與慰　袋，　得非常需要，非常感激。我受　時所乘的　架　，亦是你們婦女團體捐贈的。我深　感到前線的血，與後方的汗，匯流起來，一定會開中華民族的自由花」。——全體鼓掌表示贊同。沐先生　以×我作戰的情形說明最後勝利必屬再找。</p>
<p>王瑩女士演講的時　，再由　浮先生繙譯。王女士滔滔地說了一篇××與婦女的關係的動人講話。主　是說：現在我們女子和男子一起參加神聖的××工作了。五千多年來婦女受束縛，受壓迫的難題將可以解决了。抗戰勝利之後，我解們婦女就可　得到眞正的解放，澈底的解放。—這是很正確，精闢的論調，希望要求解放的女同胞牢牢記住。</p>
<p>蔡楚生先生亦是大家熱烈歡迎他發表高見的一位，他歸納前三位意見之後，就希望覺培的婦女要動員到各階層的婦女，喚醒沉溺於醉生夢死的一羣。並說我們要　中國救亡劇團習學，他們打前　，我們要做他的後盾，互相携手起』來。</p>
<p>李建　先生說電影明星　過去大多數是被人所輕視的，因他們過的是糜爛的生活：可是金　，王瑩二明星是不僅不會同流合汚，而且以前進的思想踢開了可以優裕可以舒適的生活，爲電影界殺出一條生路，爲挽救祖國的　亡而艱苦奮鬥，這種精神不僅是一般電影戲劇界　　　，亦是我們文化工作　應該深深表示感謝的。</p>
<p>之後，就是　亡劇團小朋友范政報告國內兒童運動的經過。他是東北人，今年才十三歲，在新安旅行　，已遊歷了很多地方，幹過很多工作。生得很天眞活潑，國語亦售確流科，這個　戰士的思想，態夏，精神，……無不使人床感興趣，深受感　。全場　氣亦活潑起來。温暖起來，這就是中華民族前途無限光明的象徵。</p>
<p>最末，　慶覽女七致答詢，表示謝意。並　願在工作上盡力幫助　國救亡劇團，與該劇團發生親密的聯系。</p>
<p>雖然是敵　，大家還有個　談着說的。彼　都　中華民挨優秀的兒女自勉。同志會面，工作會面，這是一個太難得的機會了。</p>

<h3>首輪新片介紹　浮生若夢</h3>
<p>— 云</p>
<p>佛蘭克凱勃拉導演的『盧宮秘史』和『富貴浮雲』、對干我們、該不很生疏吧、現在的『浮生若夢』、又是他的作品、全劇的人色很多、演出的機會、也很平均、劇情的大意是有這麼一個家庭、祖父温持荷（甲昂巴里摩亞飾）是個以前經商、而有　積裕的老人、因爲，他忽然感覺到、在終日上名利奔走的場中、太缺少了人生的眞趣、所以、便息影家園、與女兒、女婿、孫女們住在一起、以娛晚景、他的女兒　尼、是鎭日不停手的在打字他前打劇本、她似乎很忙碌、但是、她並不是希望成功一位名著　家、他之所以打字、只是因爲、在八年前、有人錯送了一架字機給她、而她　正是喜歡用它、她的丈夫保羅孜孜不倦的、研究焰火製造法、還有個同志　地平那（哈利威霍勃斯飾）兩人埋頭苦幹的原因、并非是可以拿出去賣了、也只因爲、這是他們的興趣所在、孫女兒變苗（恩密勒）、日常在家、跳舞鞋從不離足、她從來沒有、也沒有希望過去上舞台去表演、但是、他還請了一位以前擊拳的　國敎師（密夏奧亞飾）來指導跳舞、她的丈夫、也不出門做事、整天也只是研究研究印　、知打打洋琴、就度過去了、像這樣一個瘋瘋傻傻的家庭、只有一個是有職業的、就是另外的一個孫見雅麗絲（琴亞瑟飾）、妞是在一個大企業家安東尼（愛德華亞諾飾）的兒子湯尼（詹姆斯史蒂華飾）手下做書記、但是、這職業也做得不見認眞、她和湯尼愛上了、暗地專訂了婚、一天、雅麗絲約湯　和他的父母、到她家吃飯、湯尼却故意早一天、將父母領到她　、在她們一　沒有準備之下、倒看了了這個家庭的一種毫不矯帥的生活、但是、這自然、不會使湯尼的父母滿意的、當然、經過了一番曲折督劇之後、這對男女終於如願以慢、大告團圓了、全片映來充滿了笑聲、但是、我們若是將這張片子當作滑稽片行時、毋寧說它是一張諷刺片、大槪、這也是佛蘭凱勃拉演的特色、他總能使人在笑過了之後、還能咀嚼得出一種另外的滋味來、</p>
<p>全片的對白、十分精彩、尤其是里昂巴里摩所說的話、如他的批評風行的主義狂、向琴亞瑟訴說他早年的　愛史、和收所得稅人員的對話、那些、都是噱頭的引人發　、但却又都是極有深意的、</p>
<p>琴亞瑟在本片中、不見怎樣出色、大約是劇中人與她的個性不合之故、詹姆斯史蒂華、仍保有他只此一家、並無分出的窘相、愛德華門諾以一個大企業家的身份演出、當然再適合也沒有了、尤以後來、也加、温特荷一家人中、吹奏口琴時的神情、眞可謂　盡其妙、其他的人、個精彩、看了這張片子、使我們相信一張影片、不是兩三個掛頭牌的明星所能完功的、編劇導演以至於每個演員、都是不能疏忽的、</p>
<p>此外、全部畫面的角度異常好、也是佛蘭克凱勃拉的老門檻、</p>
<p>總而言之、這是張値得你去看的片子、他的獲得獎金、决不是偶然的、</p>
<h3>使幾位明星　抱憾的小事　一念之誤終身不忘</h3>
<p>人們最怕的是良心發現、因爲精磷上的打擊往往比肉體上的刑　更難受、所謂『一念之差、抱憾千古』者是也、我們行爲上最能速自已懺悔的往往不是那些有意的作惡、而倒是那一種無意中的疏忽、譬如說一個因開公　騙巨欵而　年坐牢監的軍犯、他並不痛悔地的用人錢財的過失、而却非常抱恨於他從前做大班的允許給一個小職員的俯恤金而沒有實踐的事、</p>
<p>好萊塢的大明星們也有同樣的事實、他們的生平大憾事、往不是一般影迷們所能想像得到、</p>
<p>某製片家請女明星紺爾潘德烈在星期日吃夜飯當他的女秘書打電詁紺給爾的時候，鉗爾問她　、「是不是正式宴會、要不要禮服、」女秘書回答說、『不是正式的宴會、不必穿』、於是到了該日、紺爾穿了便服去、但不曉得一到那邊才看見女客們、都是穿了禮服來的、而目確是止式宴會、她當然覺得非常受窘、她因此將她問過女秘書的事情向上人申明了一下、這位數片家立刻將她斥職、而向紺　道歉、紺爾事後想起這椿事情十分的反悔、因爲在她一時爲了挽囘自己面子的　係而說了一句眞情的話、並不想到便那女秘書會因此失業的、第二天她雖向某製片家爲那女秘書緩頰求情、但已無效、所以她至今想起了還非常的遺憾哩、她、「我所做的事情有許多地方雖然不免要受人們的嚴厲批評、但這一　因一看而售人失夫職位的罪惡、我自已亦不肯　恕自已呢」</p>
<p>蓓蒂台維絲和哈納爾邇約會同遊、但因爲大家霸於職務、許久日子不罪實踐他們的夢想、後來有一次他們不約而同的都不拍戲、於是她們喜出望外的整理了一些行李機一解汽車同去、當然　　鰈鰈一路　不盡的許多旖　風光、一直等到了目的地、在一家飯店中因為客滿一時找　不到座位她就和一個堂倌吵起來、納爾遜勸她不聽、結果不　而飲、敗與而歸、不過台維絲事後非常悔恨自己的意氣用事、將這樣一個快樂的郊游改爲終身抱憾的不快日像、未知他們分手後仍還、得起否</p>
<p>狄娜　萍生平也有一件恨事、據　還是遠在四五年之前、她有一天事校放學囘來、就和一個同學跑進一家電影去看戲、她當時以爲她的母親在　會中要到七時才囘家、不巧這天　的母親沒有到會中去着拱、所以過了四點時看見狄娜竇　還不回來、就打電話到四處去問、一方又派人到各處去尋、後來在散戲院的時候、她才由父親的口中曉得母親受的這　虛驚、她囘去後雖不受責駡，但終覺良心難過哩</p>
<h3>米高梅駐滬代表　談上海的觀眾</h3>
<p>米高梅駐　辨事處發言人最近曾向大陸報記者發表談話、述及上海電影觀家對於該公司影片及明星的個向、因爲所指不無相當的見地、筆者　把發言所述　種、譯在下面、以告游藝界讀者、</p>
<p>「一般中　的電影觀衆、對於美國的明星、最重視的一點、便是動作、也許唯一的　因、便是動作在影片之中、最容易　會、就是不懂英語對的白人、着了演員的動作、也可了解全片的情第、」發言人是這樣的說、</p>
<p>「如像音樂滑稽片中國的電影觀樂非常歡迎、」發言人接着說、『這種影片、通常故事的結構、是很簡單的、除了揷入音樂之外、佈景是相當的奇特和壯麗』</p>
<p>『然而你决不會知道這種影片在公映的時候一他說「有時觀的擁擠、竟會使你驚奇、舉個例子、」絕　鰪后』（Marie　Antoirette）就有這種傾向、</p>

<h3>今天特別銀牌決賽　南華南誓奪錦標　警察亦存野心決盡人事勝　乙組米軍對土葛甚難測勝負</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】特別銀牌足球賽、乃六大錦標中歷史最悠久的一項、一八九七年是第一屆、英艦山打倫隊得冠軍</p>
<p>最近十年中、南華走着銀牌紅運、先後得過七次錦標、尤以南華、連　三屆、最爲難得、</p>
<p>本屆南華南又獲得決賽權、看起來、連捷四屆的光榮紀錄、就在今天創出來了、</p>
<p>這囘决賽、敵隊　警察會、論實力、南華強得多、勝利有把握、然而、警察夠「運道」　、打到最後關頭、喜出望外、因而野心勃勃、決器其人事、與南華爭一日之雄長、</p>
<p>他們明知球　不比南華好、故早已打定主意、專心練夠氣力、希冀憑此一着、可以打坍南華、然南華已知一來老不善、」亦準備有加、</p>
<p>警察自「中西合譬一後、戰績日佳、此點足證那幾員華將、居功不少、但范貴才近患眼疾、還未痊可、今天或不曾上陣、如他缺席、將以磨士打中鋒、此立「禿頭將軍」、脚頭够力、冷然　放一記猛射、倒敎守門的會吃一驚、</p>
<p>前次聯賽、警察是堯幸勝南華、今次狹路相逢、又來算賬、南華記起一節之仇、必定趁此機會、殺固痛快、以求一雪前恥、</p>
<p>警察對此錦標、夢寐不忘、白獲决賽權後、一面苦練、又一面催促因事赴星的侯律退港、以應此役、聽說哥夫與布碌士二位宿將、也練習起來、雖然他　不一定出戰、但野心之大、可以慨見了、</p>
<p>侯律打內鋒、等於打前衛、好退後而動作又慢、不是危險份子、然他身高脚長偶然衝刺、運用頂上功夫、倒覺可怕、故他此舉、在南華守將切須提防、</p>
<p>范責才够矯捷、擅衝刺、惟中鋒非彼持長、且欠經驗、在　麥兩衛監視下、他　難活動、反之、如他因眼疾缺席、而調磨士任中鋒、恃着朋大身段、一衝一射、却會比老范來得兇些、</p>
<p>其實、警祭前線最足爲患的　還是花利亞那厮　他够活潑、傳盤也有相當功夫　故南華守將　最要緊　住此人　莫率他有　可乘、致種禍根、</p>
<p>竊以爲、南華守將對付警察　鋒的　策、首要避免力的刼持、以巧制敵、次要抵禦他們的衝刺、莫輸頂上一着、那未、他們射術非佳、便不會打破包家平的「閉關政策」了、</p>
<p>帕架、畢烈顚、挪夫三前衛、經驗　到、截擊有方、故我忠告南華前鋒、在中場决不可多用　傳、雖以馮　祥之智機、黎兆榮之伶巧、必有法賺過此楾、更進一步、但取勝掩徑、以兩翼抄擊馬上策、若多短傳、終　遲緩、</p>
<p>在星華對港華一役中、我看出陳光裕的演出、尙欠「路數」、鄧廣森　他跑得快、兆榮又够刁滑、信得過今天必會弄到老陳忙個不了</p>
<p>羅斗文必須利用捷疾的衝擊、才可攻破畢力般的最後防線、若然紆迴　擊、恐怕無效、因爲老羅對皮球管束不大可靠、容易被那富於經驗的畢氏所劫去、</p>
<p>郭英祺最好常走前一步、以衝擊從事、且有景祥從中供應、不　沒機分、</p>
<p>總之、南華已穩拿着九成勝利了、努力吧、四屆冠軍的光榮、有賴今天之勝也</p>
<p>乙組十葛對米杜息、實力半斤八兩、料劇戰情形、必不亞於甲組一役、至離得錦標、很難預斷、錄南華警察兩陣如下　（球場太歲）</p>

<p>本届第一戰、陸軍以一比二被海軍壓倒、第二戰則於本月十日（星期一）舉行、由南華對陸軍、如陸軍再敗、對錦標已絕望了、</p>
<p>陸電以大戰在卽、前天乃選出人馬、準備與南華交　、惟軍帖中却多是乙組材、尤令人詫異的、則前衛綫不取錄米杜息的三傑、而竟選用乙組球員、此點頗堪重視、</p>

<h3>南華征澳　來年可成事實　今年因猶太隊捷足先登</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】去年秋間　曾聽到南華體育會有遣派足球隊重遊澳洲的動議、若果這個成爲事實的話、今年夏季便可大軍啓行、先征南洋一帶、然後移帥澳洲、</p>
<p>此項消息傳出、迄今多月、而且已　夏天了、究竟南華這個動議、有沒有兌現的可能、抑終成空談呢、　我所知、刻下此事在擱淺中　信得過今年難以成行、然而二將來還有機會、等　曹　、</p>
<p>昨大我得識一位劉光福先生、他自澳洲歸國不久　也就是南華　釀重遊澳洲的「媒人」、據　告訴我、「今年南華未能征澳的原因、非爲別故阻梗、而是動議梢遲、被一純粹猶太人的足球隊捷足先登、所以南華今年去不成、說定來年可成事實」、</p>
<p>這位劉先生在澳洲方面交遊甚廣、他旣肯努力替南華向前球接治、或　事　於成、（東郎）</p>

<h3>中國鮮蛋輸出大受戰事影響</h3>

<h3>春光明媚中香港的清明時節</h3>
<p>— 蔡魯生</p>
<p>幾處墳場和義山的無言底訪問</p>
<p>時光箭一樣地溜去，轉瞬間，千百年相沿的「淸明佳節」又來到了人間。「緇衣莫起風　感，猶及淸明可到家，「我們誦　前人的詩句，連帶想起自己的家鄉，祖先的遺　、大家不免興及時思歸的心情；然而，許多從瓦礫堆中被炮火轟到「安樂窩」來「避難」的人們，還有多少少少人有着可歸的『家』？</p>
<p>全國皆　的淸明掃　的習俗，香港而亦沒有例外，在　天和昨天的節　中，那隱匿在雲層後多日未露過臉的太陽，居然亦肯脫穎而出，而在光芒的照　下，氣候因之由陰寒轉爲煥煖，大地也年添不少春光盪漾。在溝通數處墳場的香　道上。從大清早就來往青長　車似的　　不斷的　青人群。雖然增加了數倍班次的「巴士」。仍因乘客的過份擁擠而　次車都是高掛「免戰牌」，其他「的士」，私家車也不絕地絡繹於途。晌午，每個墳場都滿坑滿谷的　佈着了整千整萬掃墓的人們。</p>
<p>這裏，為了　明無數長眠在這異邦地下的同胞們的「生活」情形和和「淸明　節」的盛況，我雜在掃　的人群中，到幾處墳場和義山去做一次無言的訪問」。在掃墓者像潮水一樣湧流中，先後到過的有：新會，台山，增城，東莞，潮州八邑，惠州十屬，福建大口環，東華　院，鴨脷洲、幾處墳場和義山。在每個簡陋的墳墓前面，都　列着大同小男的祭品——　薦，糕　，飯，酒　燒肉，鷄鴨，魚……等已預備給鬼吃」的東西，並大燒其預備給「鬼一用的『錢」——紙錠，紙銀，「冥國銀行鈔票』，還有香燭，鞭炮，更化　得火煙繚繞，山嗚　響。最使我們這些「外　佬」詫異的是少數女人當墳而泣的哭聲，——　們好像都有絕大的悲傷地搶地呼天，起初聽起來頗　惻然，但聽淸楚了就知道她們原來是在「唱歌」——　有流淚的「乾哭」。</p>
<p>在每處墳場的附近，總有幾種應時的小營業——賣香獨其鏹的，　餛　麺的影快相的……許多大大小小的大　子。此外，因為一個墳場　是幾十幾萬的墳墓　在一塊。掃墓的人，每每因　不能尋獲墓址而需要墳場的看管人代　找尋，所以這般人亦能很順利地大做其近於　竹　的『生意』了，還有一種做二無本生涯』的在兜賣着鮮花——當來掃墓的人將鮮化供在墳則而去的時候，他們就將它重新拔起來，再賣給第二個人，這　循環着做買賣，也如能搒到一些「意外之財」。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，香港人口的遞增　，正和墳墓的增　成了個止比例。各處的義山，都因爲墳慕增加太多，致無容「棺」之地，而施行「推　出新』的辦法——而告檢遷。但在　外一個叫華人永遠墳場的，則可以始終固定葬在那裏。</p>
<p>永遠墳場的一切建　都非常華麗堂皇，較諸其他義山裏的尺　壞土，草草結穴，真有大淵之別，那裏不但有寬　敞的大禮堂——　掃慕的人們，帶　酒席來此開懷痛飲的，還有多處建築玲瓏的凉亭，以及在墳瑩　附建　的，精緻的墓　，這些墳墓的定穴，據說都是經堪與家們推敲過的，因此，在琢磨上分精細的碑碣上，就常常可以看見刻着，本山坐×向×　××等的『風水』術語。我眞想不通，爲什麼到現在還有這種痴心夢想的人——　靠「風水』來圖它個什麼「飛黃騰達」？　使萬一「風水」之說不謬，那麼世界將有弄到富的再富，窮的更窮的危險了，那是什麼話！</p>
<p>回顧狼烟高地，烽火漫天的祖國不知有多少馬革裹屍的戰士，和因奮起抗×而委屍講壑的同胞，正在融化於祖國的國土中，成爲中華民國的國　——　們難死猶生地活着，他們不需要「墳墓」。因此，看到這裏有一子兒』的人們，逐逐於爲壽終「正義」者經　華實的窀　，却不免使人感到人們是有太多的『閑情逸緻』了！</p>

<h3>論藝術的真實</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>人　藝術的任務，是在於反映和表現客觀的眞實，藝術的成功的基礎，藝術之所以能够吸引廣大的羣衆，就在乎它能够機敏地而又形象地反映出各觀的眞實，使客觀的眞實變成藝術上的真實，以一種鮮明的活躍的姿態呈現到廣大羣衆的面前，用藝術的眞實，去引誘羣衆哭與笑，鼓動羣衆喜與怒，讓舉眾在藝術中獲得了新的激刺，看見了一切過大與現在的眞實這些，就是藝術的力量，也就是藝術的任務。一部藝術作品之成功與否，就要看它所反影的客觀的眞　深度，高度和寬接來决定，所以一個藝術家在創作過和中底最重要的條件，同時也是他底成功的條件，就是把握客觀的眞實性，從客觀的眞實中，創造藝術的眞　中，創造藝術的眞實。</p>
<p>藝術的眞實，並不就是現實的眞實。有些人常常把現實的眞實和藝術的眞實混爲一談，以爲現實的真實　是藝術的眞實，藝術只要像攝影機一樣地把現實的眞實複攝到作品上去，但是　藝術　眞實』，甚至有些以爲客觀上的許多　事實」，一反映的藝術上便成爲　藝術的真實』，這些都是錯誤的。藝術的眞實，和現實的眞實不同　它是比較現　的眞實更高級，更明瞭，更迫眞的眞實，因爲它已經在客觀的基礎之上，把現實的眞實從其偶然性上淨化起來，它已經沒了那些現實中滋畏着的無籍的成分，已經汰除了一切的偶合的因子，把客觀的事實加以綜合，加以槪括，從而創造出另一種新的更進一步的東西，所以。藝術的眞實是全般的，是　的，它已經包含了客觀現實的各個的　面，而現實的眞實，却只是一面的，個別的，它只能代表整個客觀現實的一個側面，一個角落；藝術的眞實，因爲經過了藝術上的加工、因此　成了比現富的眞實　高級的東西。</p>
<p>術的眞實是把握了客觀現實的全般的整個的　程的，然而同　地也把握了客觀現實的全般過程的科畢的眞實，　也並不就是藝術的眞實，雖然科學的眞實與藝術的眞實，大家都是想從客觀的　然性的凈化上來把握客觀的『眞』和表現客觀的「眞」，　是藝術的眞實是客觀的眞實與　象的統一，而科學的眞實，却是一種客　眞實與抽象槪念的交融，換句話說，藝術是從感性的　體的形態下來把握『眞實』，從活生生的形象之中表現「眞實』，而科學，却是從論理的一般的形態上去把握「眞實」，用那些抽象化的槪怎和法則來表現「眞實」，這是兩者顯著不同的地方，是使得藝術與科學劃分開一條明助的界綫，把科學的眞實的藝術的眞實淸晣的區別開來，藝術的眞實，由於其本質的特殊規定性，它必須是客觀的眞實與形象的統一。</p>
<p>客觀的現度是發展的，作爲反映客觀現實的藝術的眞實，自然也必須是發展的，盧那卡爾斯基　經過說：「不認識發展的人，將永遠看不到眞實——因爲眞實並不酷似其原狀，並不　止前進，而是飛躍的；眞實是進展的，眞實是矛盾的，眞實是鬥爭的，真　——它是明日的，而且它必須要那樣去認識』，這幾句話，是明確的指出了眞實的明日性，未來性和發展性，藝術上的眞實，必須包　着這種未來性與明日性，才能算是把握了發展，把握了眞實。一部優秀的藝術的創　，它不偌需要反映出它當時的現實，而且需要反映到這　實　發展的未來，用明日與未來的光輝，指引羣衆底實踐的道路，這才能是創造了藝術的真實。</p>
<p>藝術的眞實是創造，乃是人類藝術的基本的任務，可是當現實有了急激的　化，比方如目前我們祖國現實中那偉人的民族革命鬥爭　場起來的時候，那藝術　家如果想要說出現實上的眞實，創造藝術的眞實，就投身於那巨大的激變之中不可，因爲只有從自身的生活實踐之中，我們才有可能體驗現實的一切變動，我們才能更親切的感覺到一切的轉化，才能　現實的原野中，發掘現實的眞實，把握現實的眞實，從　創造于現實的眞實！</p>
<h3>容身之處</h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>人生於世，按之常情，總是有一個容身之處的。然而有此人在哀號着說，甚至沒有立錐之地，這是什麼原故呢？聰明人便說，這種人會　到這樣的地步，實在是他們太蠢笨：何况天地本來是寬大的，那裏會有這樣的事呢。</p>
<p>聰明人的處世之道，的確妙不可言。約而言之他的第一步是吹，用他的嘴來吹。他的嘴賽過噓氣成雲的龍嘴，吹噓一下，大可　使天地變色，若是小小地應用一下，鼓動成風。一吹出去，雖然不必飛沙走石，拔樹倒峌，至烽也可以使他四週擁擠的人物，望風而靡，給他實廣的　面，由他　往　來，吹之爲用，不亦大乎。</p>
<p>第二步是拍，用他的手來拍，他知道吹是對付同一平面上的人物的，在他上面的人物，有時就非　所能奏效，若是一味吹，就不能呌他們不壓下來，這還須應用到拍，向上拍，好在上面的人物，都是吃這一功的，只要你　拍，他們便像皮球，條氣球，輕飄　地騰空而起，在你的頂上留出充份的空間，由你　出頭來。</p>
<p>普通的聽　人，到了吹拍皆所　長的地少，也就處境裕如，　遊自得，　再轉什麼別的今頭，就此適可而止了。獨有一般善心的聰明人，却還要更進一步，來擴充他的容身之處。這更進一步的第三步是用踏，他的脚來踏。</p>
<p>踏的妙用，似乎遠仕吹拍之上，講究立身處世者，不可不知。蓋踏也者，將其他人物踏在　底下之謂也。假使　　而四　已經　朗，因拍而頂上已經空鬆，現在脚下再有所踏，你就可以巍然高起，惟我獨尊了。甚至更進一步，你確實忙着，未　吹　，那末只要　會踏，用力的　，你脚下　得愈多，你的人也就可以抉搖直上，如方雨之木，高於岑樓起來。那時，你的向等地　者，固然望塵莫及，你的在上者，如果與你合作，你就　　地項　起來，否則乾　地就會給你頂　，他的實座，你就可以「取而代之」了。</p>
<p>為什么這種善　的聰明人。要在為善心的呢？沒有　的原故，不加利用，未免暴殄天物，有些　惜，於是大發慈悲，來一一用作　脚之物，化奧腐爲神奇，使他們各盡其力，各得其所，他簡直做了天大的好事，所以稱之爲善心的。</p>
<p>當令聰明人很多，而善心的聰明人　　多。所以人人都是大好老。而全於蠢笨的人，當然還有，不能　沒有，可是少得很。他們沒有容身之處，是活該的，誰呌他們不懂得吹拍蹈這三部曲呢！</p>
<p>蠢笨人簡直是世上的剩餘者，廢物。世上沒有了他們豈不更加地位寬宏，由得聽明人可以橫衝直撞。平心論之，聰明人是不應該給這些　笨人容身之處的，當烈，連立錐之地也　不應該留給他們的。有些聰明人還肯　他們一個脚底下的地　，使他們定以容身，這樣的聰明人，謂非善心的而何！</p>
<p>聰明人說大地是寬大的很不錯。不是他自己既有容身之處連蠢笨人也因他而有立錐之地麼！阿彌陀佛，聰明人旣聰明，又慈營，難得難得！</p>
<h3>戰時日本的姿態</h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>日軍自從在盧溝橋　放了把侵略　火後，到現在，已二十一憫月了。當戰事初起時，日本的軍人，滿望可以「旗開得勝，馬到功成」，用「少量的兵力」來悻取『大量　利益，』，他們以爲　飛機、大砲、兵　的新型戰具　再加上有計劃　政治陰謀，不難便我國「屈膝」。但在我軍堅强抗戰下去，「速戰速决」已成一塲春夢。這當然非黷武主義者始料所及。</p>
<p>那末，戰時的日本，究竟呈露着什麼　象呢？請看下面的消息，雖然都是些「琑碎」的社會動態，似乎「無關宏旨」，但以『小』喻『大』，從這裏不難想見侵略者所獲得的結果了。</p>
<p>教授饑荒</p>
<p>據日本文部省消息，最近全國各大學，因有大批教授助敎，參加人民陣綫集團，或涉有反戰思想，被人舉發，而遭受停職處分或速捕者，已很不少，於是，各大學　不痛感教授饑荒，弄得荒木文相應付爲難。現東京帝大等，六大學，合計教授不足一六九名，助敎還不足一六二名，眞是開日本教育界空前未有的現象。</p>
<p>無法出嫁　日本的女性，仍沒有脫離封建社會的束縛，「良妻賢母」是她　最高的道德指標，大多數女子是以「結婚」爲解决生活的捷徑，但最近，因對華戰事的延宕不决，年　的男子，紛紛被徵發到中國前綫來，而且傷亡數又那末的多，無形中，去奪了不少日本少女的丈夫，使已屆結婚年齡的少女，無法找得結婚的對象，據取近東京市社會局的調查，光是東京市內，就有二十萬名。這些妙齡的少女，因無法出嫁，祇得流浪　頭，找尋職業，但那有許多現成的位置來安揷這些待嫁女郎呢？</p>

<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『走吧，凍死鬼沒有温暖的墓穴！』然後，又偷偷地說：『我可以饒你不做一個凍死鬼，可是，我管不了偵樣捉你去做一個罪犯！』</p>
<p>於是，他感到有一種恐怖還甚過寒冷的威脅，他鎭靜地向四外探望，望到幾尺外的地方，便被模糊的夜色糢糊了視綫，他又在靜聽，彷彿聽見有鞋了磨　雪路的聲首，漸漸地　過來，在他注視遠處的時候，那白色的路上，並不見異色的行踪，但那聲首，仍在響着，近着，直是在他的身邊，有幾片枯葉被風所　動，互相磨擦而又磨擦着雪路旋轉，他爲了使自己放心，一脚　碎了那些臨到末運的枯葉。不久，又有一種新的響聲，來自遠處，他靜靜地一聽，他相信是一個　間巡邏的警長——在行走中，佩刀的皮鞘　綁着皮的裹腿的響聲，他急燥了，終于又開始問她：</p>
<p>『你不能隨我去嗎？』</p>
<p>『問你自己！」哼了一聲鼻聲：『我已經告訴過你啦！』</p>
<p>『我亦不能放你走，那你就站在這里嗎？』</p>
<p>『我寧願站在這里！』</p>
<p>『這裏，你想會有一個警長經過嗎？』</p>
<p>『什　緊張？』</p>
<p>『不是「緊張」，是警長。警長，也就是偵探，你想等一固偵探來，把我告密嗎？』</p>
<p>『不！我爲什麼要使別人受苦呢？我不願意別人因爲我發生不幸。可，是我也不能讓別人害我。現在，我最後一次告訴你，你再走的時候，祇有你一人！』</p>
<p>這時候，遠處　近處，聽不見任何的聲響。騷擾他的，祇有　邊的風雪——不是用一種力量扯動他的衣服，便是讓一種冰冷刺激他的臉面。但這在生於寒帶的人，自然慣於寒帶的生活，尤其是　——一個受寒者，每年祇盼待黃冬天，好像白熊一樣，每年從風雪中反得整年嬉遊的快樂。不過，他這次對於風雪，感覺厭煩。因爲這風雪不僅不給他往年的快樂，而且，使他不安。他時時要用手在耳邊擋着風，或是在眼前打着雪，不讓風雪擾亂了，糢糊了他的聽　和視線。這一切，他都是爲了監視她。他祖心她在自己一　的不經心中不顧一切而逃失。雖然，他相信自己仍有約束她的餘力，使她難於逃脫；但是，他怕由於逃脫而引起更意外的破裂和失敗。　（卅）</p>

<h3>Albanian War Clouds and the European Situation</h3>
<p>The European situation is such that one wave subsides only for another to rise. Seeing these few days of dispatches, Albania is again shrouded in war clouds, and the situation is precarious.</p>
<p>Albania is one of the six Balkan countries, located on the western side of the Balkan Peninsula, bordering Yugoslavia to the northeast and Greece to the southeast. To the west, it faces Italy across the Adriatic Sea. Its strategic location has long earned it the reputation of being the heart of the Balkan countries. In recent years, fascist aggression has swept across Europe. Hitler has made steady progress, and Mussolini is even more eager to avoid being overshadowed. Recently, to gain the price of seeking aid from Hitler, he is urgently seeking to expand his power in the Mediterranean. Consolidating military power on the Adriatic Sea is one of the most important strategic goals. Albania is located at a crucial passage for Central European advancement southward, making it undoubtedly the leading edge of Mussolini's further aggression. Moreover, Albania possesses large amounts of undeveloped mineral resources and has oil production that has always been a target for the great powers! Furthermore, as the British government is gradually showing a tendency to actively change its foreign policy, Mussolini's launch of a military occupation of Albania can threaten its neighboring countries, Yugoslavia and Greece, preventing them from taking steps against the German-Italian axis of aggression, thereby controlling all the Balkan countries and further weakening and isolating Britain and France.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we should recognize the following points: Firstly, the Italian aggressors' occupation of Albania aims to seize control of the country, with particular attention to plundering its oil, while also consolidating the Adriatic Sea, thereby preparing to control and blockade British and French transportation in the Mediterranean. This move is clearly the beginning of a further offensive by Italy against Britain and France. Secondly, the Italian aggressors' occupation of Albania simultaneously threatens Yugoslavia, Greece, and even all the Balkan Peninsula countries. Coupled with the recent chaotic dance of the shadows of Italian and German aggression in Palestine and Iraq, it clearly proves that Britain and France are already in the process of being further surrounded by fascist aggressors. Thirdly, the Italian aggressors' occupation of Albania has indeed received the active support of the German aggressors. An Associated Press dispatch from Rome on April 5 stated, "The Italian authorities have secretly mobilized naval, land, and air forces, and the army headquarters in Algiers has been transferred from Rome to Taranto. Also, a German vehicle team has been dispatched to Italian territory." At the same time, news of German reconnaissance into Denmark and the Netherlands has also appeared in various newspapers. From this, it is even more evident that although internal contradictions between Germany and Italy are developing, the axis will inevitably appear stronger and the connection will be closer in terms of aggressive actions. All arguments excessively exaggerating the division of the aggressive front are baseless. Finally, we see that the European situation has become tense again, and there is sudden news of a Soviet border conflict, which proves that the aggressors are trying to coordinate with each other from east to west. We should pay attention to the Japanese aggressors taking this opportunity to launch their military and political conspiracies in the Far East!</p>
<p>In response to these serious developments, we should emphasize that the international fascist aggressors' further offensives are comprehensive and total. Those threatened and harmed are all democratic and peace-loving countries, not just a few small countries. However, at the same time, we should also point out that the fascist aggressors' further offensives are aimed at the recent success of Soviet peaceful diplomacy and the strengthening of the democratic and peace-loving front. This shows that their strategic position has already degenerated to a passive tendency and proves that their offensives can be overcome and defeated! Therefore, our current task is to accelerate the unity of all forces that cherish democracy and peace and to use force to combat this new offensive by the aggressors. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on April 5, "The British government is currently considering a plan to strengthen the peace-loving front. It is reported that the plan seeks to establish a system of military strategic consultation among countries (establish an International Military Strategic Bureau)." This is certainly one of the important countermeasures to meet the current urgent needs. In addition to supporting it in principle, we should also promote the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to quickly and earnestly establish a form of international conference to deal with fascist aggressors. When using this form to resolve international disputes, we must first recognize the truth that "peace is indivisible," recognize the international nature of the fascist threat, oppose all incomplete and therefore ineffective unilateral guarantees or partial solutions, and oppose all claims that only talk about the European situation and ignore the rampant aggression of the aggressors in the Far East. Secondly, we must earnestly and practically unite all countries that cherish democracy and peace. Here, it is not enough to be satisfied with the participation of the Soviet Union alone. We must also strengthen the unity of all small countries and weak nations, and in particular, we must earnestly recognize the contribution of China, which has been bravely resisting for more than 20 months, to the world, and its important position in the current international situation. Any resolution of international disputes, especially international consultations on sanctioning fascist aggressors, if China does not participate and take into account China's current position and interests, then we can hardly imagine that there will be any satisfactory results. This is what we want to emphasize in particular, and this is what we want to make special efforts to achieve.</p>
<h3>Friends of China in China (I)</h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>Mr. Li Meng was one of the two directors of the national radio station during the People's Front government in France. At the same time, he also served as the deputy secretary-general of the propaganda department of the state-owned cabinet. He has an excellent reputation in public opinion. This time, he came to China as a special correspondent for the Paris "New Europe" magazine and the "Otto Daily" newspaper, introduced by our ambassador to Paris, Mr. Gu Weijun. Ms. Shi Meishi is a film reporter for "World's Eyes" magazine. She is the daughter of General Guo Shimei, who died on the front lines during the European War in France. She has two older brothers, one serving as a naval colonel stationed in the northern African Fenice area, and the other as an important consultant in the French government. She can marry Qi Meng, who comes from a working-class background and has not yet attended a formal university, as a woman from an aristocratic background. From this point of view, it can be imagined that her thoughts and spirit are indeed worthy of reading and admiring. They want to use words and photos to record the inhuman acts of the Japanese military in China and the heroic battles of the Chinese military and civilians against the two-way invasion. Moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng firmly believe with 120,000 points of sincerity that China will inevitably achieve final victory. After the Hainan Island Incident, Li Meng wrote an article, "Hainan Island Affects the Entire Situation in the Far East." In this paper, he clearly pointed out, "Only the victory of China is the guarantee of peace in the Far East and security in the Pacific." Yes, not only are China and France the same in terms of national character, both deeply loving freedom, peace, and independence, but also in terms of diplomatic interests and geographical connections, China and France should work closely together. In Europe, since Franco came to power in Spain, France has fallen into the encirclement of fascist forces. To the east, it is threatened by Germany; to the southeast, Somoni, Hitler's ally, is waiting for an opportunity; the Mediterranean Sea to the south is even more densely covered with the forces of fascist aggressors; and to the southwest, Franco, the running dog of Germany and Italy, is barking. In French Morocco in North Africa, it is also constantly attacked by German and Italian forces. The Sicilian Island (Simlia lland) and Pantellaria Island (Pintellaria lland) in the Mediterranean Sea have caused endless trouble for Tunis (Lnnig). In the Far East, since Japan tore up the 1907 agreement on the Hainan Island issue and carried out armed occupation, it has destroyed the entire security guarantee of Annam. This is such a shocking disappearance. Less than two days after Japan occupied Hainan Island, Japan actually made a new request to France for the Panracels Islands in the northwest of Hainan Island—at the same time, we know that Siam and Japan have a kind of secret provisional agreement. Once something happens, wouldn't Annam be attacked from both sides? Therefore, as Li Bei said, "Now is the time for us to be deeply aware and truly sincere. He glanced at the naval and air force bases that we hope to build in the Far East, but the only reliable force that can truly prevent Japan from invading the South, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and attempting to control the Far East and the Pacific is the victory and independence of China. Undoubtedly, the combination of China and France is one of the great driving forces for promoting world peace. I believe that the vast majority of people in China and France already have such a deep trust. The remaining task is how to strengthen publicity and increase influence, so that every French person can deeply understand the two paths of China's resistance war are bright, only victory! Throw all the propaganda materials of Japanese imperialism in Paris into the toilet. Therefore, we welcome 'Friends of China' to China, they will surely get a full understanding of the impressions, and understand the truly great power of the Chinese nation!"</p>
<p>China's War of Resistance is long-term, anti-aggression, the weak against the strong, and revolutionary. Therefore, we need the sympathy and assistance of the vast masses of peace-loving people around the world. At the same time, we firmly believe that international public opinion must be on our side. Not only are the people in major countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union like this, but also many small countries in the Far East and the Near East are eagerly expecting China to win the war, regarding China as their savior for survival. According to Ma Tianying, the representative of the Islamic Near East Study Group who recently returned to China, "India, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran, and all the countries in the Near East have held seven 'China Days'. They are eager for news about China's War of Resistance, and they are waiting to welcome every Chinese person who goes to the Near East. However, there are too few people from our country who go there, and there is too much news about the war, while the Japanese are doing propaganda everywhere, shamelessly trying to please the Islamic people..." Yes. I want to repeat a sentence: We have already gained the widespread sympathy of the people all over the world. The work left here is how to communicate, connect, and increase their understanding of the actual situation in China! Therefore, we warmly welcome the "Friends of China" all over the world to China, to spread the brave history of China's War of Resistance to the world. At the same time, we must not forget the world nature of the Sino-Japanese War. The mad actions of the Japanese warlords, or rather, the aggressive behavior of international fascism, are by no means simply enemies of the 450 million Chinese people, but rather the beginning of preparing to control the world. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War may transform into the last massacre of mankind. In the process of this war, the entire world's politics, economy, and culture will enter an unprecedented dramatic change, and approach the final result of mankind, victory and glory. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War is by no means a problem limited to the East, but will deeply and inevitably affect the world. Therefore, in order to respond to the environmental needs of this great era, the unity movement of international news practitioners should be rapidly developed and firmly established. However, it is undeniable that not only with foreign countries, but also with foreign reporters in China, we do not yet have a close connection and have not achieved good cooperation. This time, reporters and Li went from South China to Northwest China together, almost defining the entire war in China. In order to raise the attention of the people to this issue, and to promote the development of the movement, I would like to make a brief record of the situation of Mr. and Mrs. Li in China.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Why [Peace]</h3>
<p>— Lao Ne</p>
<p>—The Sorrowful Words of a Refugee—</p>
<p>I am a refugee from North China, and I have been engaged in education for many years. Since the fall of Tianjin and Peiping, I have taken my family to the south, struggling to survive in Hong Kong for over a year. Because I don't speak Cantonese, it is a bit difficult to communicate with friends. I feel lonely sitting in my small room all day. The only thing I rely on for entertainment is reading the newspaper. Not long ago, I saw that the Hong Kong ×× Daily published a paper by Mr. Dai, titled "Give an Example." I was surprised, deeply moved, and extremely bewildered. I wanted to keep the newspaper so that I could carefully examine his intention, but unexpectedly it was torn up by my young child, and I could not translate the original text again. I studied it sentence by sentence. Fortunately, the general idea of the original text has probably spread throughout Hong Kong, so there is no need to go into detail. I originally respected Mr. Mou's foolish sincerity, but I am boldly asking for guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Mou criticized, "Advocating peace is my view on national affairs." He also said, "I should do my best to advocate a realistic limit."</p>
<p>I do not know what is the difference between advocating peace and surrender, or what is different from submission. If seeking peace does not fear national humiliation, and after peace, it does not exist in name only but still retains territorial sovereignty and remains complete, then peace is not impossible. But may I ask, can Mr. Mou really be sure that he can do it?</p>
<p>If peace cannot maintain territorial sovereignty and results in losing the country and humiliating the nation, existing in name only, then is advocating peace beneficial to the country or harmful to the country? Please, Mr. Mou, calm down and think about it. Have you been fighting for the revolution for decades to get promoted and make a fortune for yourself? Or is it to fulfill what our predecessors left behind, "Devoting ourselves to the National Revolution for ten years, the goal of which is to seek freedom and equality for China"?</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Mou said, "What I sincerely and earnestly seek is the long-term stability of East Asia. If China and Japan fight, both will be defeated and injured. If they make peace, they will coexist."</p>
<p>Alas, if China and Japan fight, both will be defeated and injured. This is indeed true. But may I ask, did we start the war? Aggression has no end. Should we just sit and wait for death without resisting?</p>
<p>Another thing that perplexes people is "If they make peace, they will coexist." May I ask what is a country? Is its definition not a strict stipulation of the integrity of three essential elements: territory, people, and sovereignty? Suppose there is only territory and people, and sovereignty is no longer complete. Then it exists in name only. Korea is gone, but its land still exists and its people still survive. Only its sovereignty is lost. After making peace, the other side can survive, but can we still survive? What is the interpretation of the so-called coexistence?</p>
<p>I guess Mr. Mou's original intention is probably that he believes that continued resistance with our country's weak strength will be even more unfavorable. It is better to temporarily endure humiliation and seek peace, temporarily preserve strength, wait for an opportunity, and gradually recover.</p>
<p>There is some reason for this view. However, may I ask, will the other side allow us to nurture our elite forces, wait for the time to work hard, without taking precautions and putting us to death?</p>
<p>Also, the conclusion in the latter part is quite prescient. It is believed that in today's world, who else is there but me. Everyone knows that × is strong and we are weak. The heavy sacrifices have long been expected. However, the whole country is united in its determination to resist to the end, preferring to be shattered jade than to be complete tiles. This is because our country has had the spirit of Confucius for thousands of years, "Knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway," and "There are things that are more desirable than life, and there are things that are more detestable than death." If everyone imitates Mr. Mou, knowing that war will inevitably lead to defeat, it is better to seek peace first. Then Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa are really foolish and unachievable, while Qin Hui and Hong Chengchou are outstanding figures who know the times. Should etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and loyalty, filial piety, festival, and justice, the eight great characters, still be preserved?</p>
<p>Because of the word integrity, I thought of the former military officer, Mr. Wu, who lost power in Beiping and was so impoverished that he could not make a living. The × side surrounded him day and night, using coercion and inducement, trying every means to persuade him to come out of the mountains. But Mr. Wu was stubborn and unyielding. A poor and destitute military officer known for his counter-revolution had the spirit of being incorruptible in wealth, unshakable in poverty and humility, and unyielding in the face of power. But a party-state great man who started with revolution and reached the height of power actually sails with the wind and is the first to kneel. This is truly a strange thing. The revolution must first reform the heart. Confucius said, "At first, I listened to people's words and believed in their actions. Now I listen to their words and observe their actions." Hypocrisy and sophistry have existed since ancient times, and they are more prevalent today.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Mou said that the Communist Party likes to make trouble.</p>
<p>According to what I have heard from the refugees from the north, the Eighth Route Army conducts guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas and has very good discipline. They cooperate with the people and do not commit any crimes. Moreover, they abandoned class slogans and protected local wealthy merchants and gentlemen equally. Not only that, they also properly protected foreign missionaries and pastors, not at all like the spirit of the anti-religious alliance of the previous year (opposing theocracy). So the claim that the Communist Party is making trouble is completely unfounded. If opposing peace and advocating resistance is considered making trouble, then if one wants to condemn someone, there is no shortage of excuses. And is it only the Communist Party that opposes peace? Even though this year has been more than a year, with no information, no idea of life or death, and not knowing whether they are alive or dead, and two of my sons have joined the army, there has been no news for half a year, and two of my nephews have joined the army and have already died in battle. I am saddened and cannot sleep at night, selling my belongings and borrowing money to make a living, eager for the war to end soon, hoping to return home and farm the fields, to avoid dying in a foreign land. However, I still endure the pain and do not want to hear the voice of submission and peace. Then I know that people share the same heart and the same principle. It is not just the Communist Party that opposes peace. Or, as I call it, those who are ignorant and do not understand the affairs, deeply believe that the fate of the country lies in human effort. If today's important figures had a few more Wen Tianxiangs, Lu Xiufus, and Shi Kefas, then there would still be hope for a better future. The fall of the Song and Ming dynasties was really due to the greed of the emperors and ministers at that time, and the ignorance of the people, who did not know the misery of national subjugation and regarded changing dynasties as a common occurrence. But today, there is an enlightened, decisive, steadfast, and outstanding leader above, and patriotic youths who are aware of sacrifice and regard death as returning home below. The national consciousness is unified throughout the country. This is completely different from the end of the Song and Ming dynasties. Moreover, in today's world, international relations are complex and complicated. Although we cannot rely entirely on foreign aid, it can still increase our assistance. Based on the experience of more than 20 months of war, our sacrifices have been great, and our courage is not small. What is shameful is that our weapons and personnel are lagging behind. If our warships, airplanes, and artillery were not so far apart from the other side, then we would be even more confident of winning the final victory. Therefore, at present, we must step up organization and training so that military, political, educational, and economic construction can all progress to the level of modernization, which is the level of science. Then the war situation will improve, and the other side will know the difficulty and retreat. At that time, if both sides are sincere and wholeheartedly seek a long-term stability in East Asia, it may be easier to achieve. The important thing is to be able to fight before we can talk about peace. If we cannot fight, we can never talk about peace. After Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, Mr. Mou sang of peace and said that people from both countries should work together. Then can it be said that knowing the times makes one a hero? How would the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves, the front-line soldiers who sacrificed themselves, and the rear-area civilians who sacrificed themselves feel if they knew?</p>
<h3>Save Hong Kong's Children</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qizhuo</p>
<p>If Hong Kong has a million people, and children make up a quarter of that, then there are a huge 250,000 children in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>What kind of life are these 250,000 children living?</p>
<p>——Selling newspapers, shining shoes, doing hard labor, being enslaved, wandering...struggling on the edge of starvation, suffering painful bullying, living a dark and hopeless life, letting their golden childhood vanish like the wind, like bubbles, without a trace, what a painful reality!</p>
<p>What about the so-called "happy" children?</p>
<p>——Influenced by their families, they are instilled with "money worship" and "feudal" ideas; some are also infected by "mahjong education" and distorted family systems.</p>
<p>In prison-like schools, there are old teachers' scoldings and beatings, as well as tedious "sermons" that are difficult to understand and bear.</p>
<p>What "classical Chinese"! What "English"!… Stuffing a string of ancient people and adults' "things" into their weak minds, plus the old teacher's "serious discipline," today dictation, tomorrow recitation, covering the pure souls of children with a layer of darkness, the great creativity suffers stern blows and is declared aborted. The "happy" children, although spared the threat of material life, suffer enough spiritual abuse!</p>
<p>——Such children are our future masters, the future masters who we hope will continue our generation's steps to build the country. How can such masters not make people tremble with fear?</p>
<p>The twentieth century is the century of children; the quality of children determines the fate of a nation's rise and fall. If others snatch away our children, we must reclaim and nurture our children. "Save our children" should also be a pressing task.</p>
<p>Before the entire social system can be changed, we certainly do not dare to expect the children's problem to be completely and satisfactorily solved. However, there are still many ways to rescue children that can be done here and now, and action should be launched immediately:</p>
<p>1. Please Teachers Put Down the Whip</p>
<p>"Corporal punishment" is said to be a common phenomenon in Hong Kong schools. The "whip" in the old teacher's hand has changed from a "teaching tool" to an "instrument of torture." Why beat the weak children? Apart from "wildness" and "violent venting," there is no justification for it.</p>
<p>The excuse for implementing corporal punishment is that it "encourages good children to work harder and makes bad children aware of discipline." In fact, is there really an effect of "encouraging" and "making aware of discipline?" The executor of corporal punishment knows this best himself. Any teacher or parent with a little conscience will deeply regret it after administering corporal punishment to a child. "Encouragement" and "discipline" have other educational methods to follow. Today, the strategy of "corporal punishment" can no longer be used. The Ministry of Education's report on the abolition of corporal punishment is the crystallization of research and experimentation by national experts and progressive schools and teachers. It is a model that anyone educating children should carefully study and diligently practice. The government's repeated orders to ban corporal punishment are also laws that every school and every teacher should absolutely obey.</p>
<p>Those who stubbornly cling to their prejudices and cannot overcome their bad tempers may put on a stern face and come up with seemingly reasonable reasons to protest: "Theory says so, but you don't know the difficulties in reality—some children really have to be beaten sometimes!" However, the author has lived among children for many years and does not feel that way. I don't know how many educational pioneers have been able to practice character cultivation and gradual guidance! The author pleads for children and sincerely hopes that those who believe "corporal punishment is useful" will humbly observe how progressive teachers treat children and how they obtain spiritual comfort, and then read the Ministry of Education's report on the abolition of corporal punishment to study whether it can be implemented. At that time, they will definitely resolutely "put down the whip and immediately become a good teacher." If they still stubbornly insist that "corporal punishment is necessary," then they must frankly admit: "I have no way to teach children," not that "children must be beaten."</p>
<p>The harm that corporal punishment does to children's physiology and psychology is too shallow to be discussed! To save children, the first thing to do is to eliminate the greatest enemy of children! Ignorant parents may not be able to do this universally, but "please teachers put down the whip" should not be a problem, right?</p>
<p>2. Don't Teach Children Things They Can't Understand</p>
<p>After the children are freed from the torture of the whip, next, we hope that the teachers will not teach the children things they cannot understand. Like the "profound" "classical Chinese" and "English"… It really makes the children more and more confused as they read. What does child-centered education mean? What do curriculum standards tell us? Teachers must not ruin the future of their students, nor must they be afraid of the nation's crisis. Teaching classical Chinese and English is said to be "adapting to the environment," which certainly has its merits. However, "adaptation" should have a limit! Moreover, "adapting to the environment" is not the ultimate goal of education, but a means to "transform the environment." White powder can kill people, and killing people without shedding blood is even more terrible. How should the manipulator handle things carefully! Teachers are like wielding a knife in their hands. Are they killing the children around them, or opening a path for the children to move forward? This is something that teachers must decide for themselves. I sincerely hope that our teachers will save our children!</p>
<p>3. Launch a Spiritual Food Movement for Children</p>
<p>Children have curiosity and a strong desire for knowledge. The monotonous and boring textbooks in schools are certainly not enough to meet the children's needs. If there is no progressive teacher to guide the reading of beneficial children's books, they will undoubtedly drill into "comic books." Being addicted to "comic books" is already a common phenomenon and a serious problem. This bad influence really makes people with good intentions feel heartbroken!</p>
<p>In response to this serious fact, there is a great need to launch a spiritual food movement for children. All progressive teachers, writers, artists, and the press should unite to bear the responsibility for this long-neglected but significant movement. In addition to improving the quality and strengthening the existing children's publications (especially comic books), children's newspapers, children's paintings, new comic books, children's periodicals, children's plays, etc. should all appear with a brand-new look, so that the majority of children can obtain fresh and progressive spiritual food.</p>
<p>4. Let Children Grow Up in Collectives</p>
<p>Children are not the private property of their parents, nor are they toys that can be monopolized. They belong to society, to the nation. Therefore, they need to grow up in collectives.</p>
<p>The New An Travel Troupe, the Shanghai Children's Theater Troupe, the Xiamen Children's Theater Troupe… These progressive children's organizations have indeed shown amazing achievements in the crucible of the collective. The children's nurseries and student associations in Hong Kong are also large groups of children. If they are strengthened, how great a role will they play? I sincerely hope that the teachers and student associations of various schools will not hesitate to make every effort to bring all the children in Hong Kong and Kowloon under the unified leadership of children's organizations, to live a collective life and grow up in the collective. Children's organizations have already done a lot of work for children in the past and have a glorious history. In the future, in addition to further developing collective reading movements, health movements, and national salvation movements… It is also necessary to implement a Young Pioneer system, so that school children can take on the daily tasks they should bear, to educate children in the neighborhoods, and to connect and unite with British children in Hong Kong and children friends at home and abroad. What a meaningful movement this would be!</p>
<p>British children in Hong Kong have already joined hands with children from children's nurseries; the implementation of the Young Pioneer system is also a popular movement in the mainland; national and global children's correspondence, under the advocacy of the National Central University Experimental School, has also set a precedent. It is hoped that the children of Hong Kong will also be vigilant in the sound of the anti-Japanese war in the mainland and catch up with the great and progressive motherland, which also needs such masters.</p>
<p>The scope of saving children is very broad; the four points mentioned above are only the minimum actions that should be started and can be started at this time and in this place. These small opinions are very ordinary; I also hope that they can "draw jade" by "throwing a brick." The author, at his own risk, put them forward, and the motive is only this. I deeply hope that our children can be rescued from the anger of the great era.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Sihui, 7th Dispatch] Our troops counterattacking Jiangmen are making rapid progress. A vanguard of plainclothes soldiers charged into the city center at 8:00 AM on the 6th. The main force followed, and the enemy fled in panic to Tangxia. We pursued and killed more than 200 enemy soldiers, and countless were wounded. Many spoils of war were seized, and Jiangmen was officially recaptured by us. A small unit of the enemy attacking Xinhui was surrounded and annihilated by us due to their inability to retreat.</p>

In the evening, we once attacked Jiangcun, and the fighting with the enemy was very fierce. At night, because the enemy used many cannons to form a fire net and attacked us fiercely, we withdrew and held firm in the area north of Jiangcun.

This morning, we are besieging and annihilating the remaining enemy entrenched in Yushagang and the Overseas Chinese Memorial Hall.

The enemy in Longkou Village, after our fierce attack, stubbornly resisted with fierce artillery fire and sent troops to attack us from the flanks. At noon on the 6th, a unit of more than 400 enemy infantry and cavalry, under the cover of aircraft, entered the Shidong area (northeast of Huaxian) via Pingshan and Lianglong Huaxian City to contain our army in Xin'an Street.

The enemy was extremely panicked, and more than a thousand enemy merchants, women, children, and wounded soldiers in the urban area fled in disarray. Guangzhou is now under martial law. The enemy took the opportunity to search for military supplies and looted property, which was even worse than before, and people were in a state of panic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Sihui, 7th Dispatch] At 9:00 AM today, several squadrons of our air force suddenly appeared over Sanshui Nanhai and bombed the enemy positions fiercely.

<p>Jinjiang Across the River Confrontation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 6th Special Telegram] Banlin Telegram: The enemy in Jiangxi has been in a difficult situation due to our fierce counterattacks for days. Our counterattacking troops in Wuning once approached the county seat and are still engaged in fierce fighting in the vicinity.

<p>[Central News Agency Yushui, 7th Dispatch] The enemy, who had occupied Xi'an, was unable to stand firm due to our continuous attacks for days and retreated to Gaocheng on the 7th. When they left, they set fire to the city. Our army took the opportunity to attack and captured it successfully.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xinyang, 7th Dispatch] A certain vanguard unit of our army is now fiercely attacking Zhongjingguan. In order to secure the stronghold of Xinyang, the enemy yesterday dispatched a force of enemy soldiers to Zhugou. Fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>

<h3>The Military Affairs Commission Releases a Weekly War Report (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Henan Province</p>
<p>The battles in Henan Province are more intense in the Xinyang area. Our army surrounded the county seat on three sides last week, and the enemy's retreat route has been cut off. This week, the enemy increased reinforcements by one or two thousand, along with many cannons and aircraft, and launched a counterattack against us in separate routes. The two sides repeatedly engaged in unprecedented fierce battles near the county seat at Luotuodian, Shizipo, and Yugukou. After suffering losses, the enemy indiscriminately released poison gas, but all failed. Currently, the outposts in the four suburbs of the city are still in our hands, and all traffic in all directions has been completely cut off by us. The enemy, who stubbornly resisted in the city, is in a state of being trapped in a jar. As for the enemy in eastern Henan, this week, they once joined forces with the puppet army of Cao Wenchen to attack Shicao, west of Luyi. After our counterattack, we achieved a victory, killing more than 200 enemy and puppet soldiers. The puppet army leader Zhang Wenchen and more than a hundred others were captured. The enemy in Yuanwu, northern Henan, numbering four to five hundred, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the southwest on the morning of the 1st and engaged in fierce fighting with us. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the road that night. There has been no further movement as of yet. Also, at Sanzhongzhai, the enemy forcibly recruited civilians to block the mouths of the tunnels. On the morning of the 2nd, our army launched a courageous attack, and the workers bravely responded, attacking from both inside and outside, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy showed signs of fleeing east.</p>
<p>Other Areas</p>
<p>In addition, (1) In the Tongling Qingyang area of southern Anhui, the fierce battles between our and enemy armies are still very intense. The strongholds of Zengxing, Zhongpaifang Mountain, Chengjia, and Daxiaogang have all been recaptured in succession. The enemy retreated to the county seat to engage in stubborn resistance. Another unit of our army attacking Wanqi and Shuilishan has occupied the enemy's first line of defense and is now continuing to advance. (2) Our army in Jiangnan recently launched a multi-pronged attack on Yixing and has recaptured Shushan. They have now reached the suburbs of the city and are intensifying the siege. (3) In Suiyuan, on the dawn of the 31st, the enemy army launched a fierce three-pronged attack on our army in Daqingshan from Baotou, Sulaqi, and Guyang. Our army made use of the natural barriers and launched a timely counterattack, killing more than 500 enemy soldiers. They are currently still in a stalemate. (End)</p>
<h3>Enemy Casualties Increase Sharply After We Expand Mobile Warfare. Nineteen High-Ranking Enemy Officers Killed. We Will Surely Win in the War of Attrition. Important Statistics from the Jin-Sui War Zone.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Yuji, 6th Dispatch] The responsible agency of a certain war zone recently released various statistics since the start of the war.</p>
<p>In northern Shanxi and Suiyuan, at Yanmenguan, Datong, Tianzhen, Pingxingguan, Longjiaoling, Xinkou (including Yuanping), Niangziguan, Taiyuan, and Ganhuling, in eight positional battles, the ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 2.3 to 1.</p>
<p>In thirty-five city attacks, twenty-four were successful and fifteen were failures. In five counterattacks (in the area of Hanhouling Tanqu), in thirty-two fortified attacks, the ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 1.4 to 1.</p>
<p>In fighting against the enemy on the march, from March 27 to February of this year, there were twelve larger battles and twenty-nine smaller battles. The ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 3 to 5.</p>
<p>In mobile battles above the regiment level, there were a total of nine hundred and fifty-one from March 27 to March 18 of this year, and two thousand three hundred and twenty-two below the regiment level. In one hundred and thirty-two large-scale night raids, ninety-four were successful and thirty-eight were unsuccessful. The ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 1 to 4.</p>
<p>Nineteen enemy officers above the rank of major were killed, including Major General Miura Toshiji, commander of the 21st Regiment of the 5th Division (Xinkou), Major General Uemura Yoshio, commander of the 40th Brigade of the 20th Division (Quhou), a field marshal (title unknown, Zhongtiaoshan), Colonel Saeki, commander of the Engineers Regiment (Jun County), Colonel Shinzou Yu, commander of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Division (Qikou), Colonel Kaido Akira, commander of the 123rd Regiment of the 108th Division (Lingshi), Colonel Ishida Kin, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division (Liulin), Colonel, commander of the Field Artillery Regiment (name unknown, Wangwushan), Lieutenant Colonel Takeshima Hitoshi, commander of the Battalion of the 20th Division (Pindin), Lieutenant Colonel Okazaki Tsutanosuke, commander of the Battalion of the 105th Regiment of the 108th Division (Gaoping), Lieutenant Colonel Naruse Kotobuki, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division (location unknown), Lieutenant Colonel Tanimura Bunma, commander of the Battalion of the Field Artillery Regiment (Xinkou), Lieutenant Colonel Toshihayashi Heichiro, commander of the Battalion of the Field Artillery Regiment of the 108th Division (Niangziguan), Major Motoura, commander of the 18th Cavalry Regiment (Lushi), Major Fuji Kunitaro, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division (location unknown), Major Sata Ai, commander of the 78th Regiment of the 20th Division (Nankou), Major Yamade Taitsune, commander of the Battalion of the 14th Division (Lushi), Major Ozaku Heiga, commander of the Independent Machine Gun Unit of the 14th Division (Lushi), Major Takahashi Habun, commander of the 77th Regiment of the 20th Division (Nankou), totaling three generals, five colonels, five lieutenant colonels, and six majors. According to the above statistics, the most noteworthy is the dramatic change in the ratio of our casualties to the enemy's. Before March 27, in positional warfare, we sacrificed twenty-three people to kill one enemy soldier. After March, due to mobile warfare and fortified attacks, we sacrificed 1.4 people to kill one enemy soldier. In fighting on the march, we sacrificed three people to kill five enemy soldiers. In night raids, for every one person we sacrificed, the enemy suffered four casualties. We are constantly replenishing our strength and engaging in long-term warfare with the increasingly weakened enemy. The difference in these figures will continue to increase. It can be asserted that if we continue to support the war of attrition and deplete the enemy's strength, the enemy will inevitably fail.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Students of the Army University and Delivers a Personal Admonishment During the Meeting.</h3>

<h3>Anti-War Riots Within the Enemy Army. The Wife of a Captain Commits Suicide as a Result. A Japanese Newspaper Unintentionally Reveals the Truth.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] According to a foreigner who recently arrived from Tokyo, anti-war riots within the enemy army are frequently heard of and are indeed true. However, their scale is still small and lacks coordination, so they cannot become a powerful action. The enemy is extremely secretive and strictly prohibits newspapers from publishing such news, so few people know about it. However, there is evidence to prove that this statement is not fictitious. In a report in the Osaka Asahi Newspaper on February 10 concerning the suicide of the wife of Captain Hayashi Yuichi, it was said that the reason was that her husband was fighting on the front lines, and many of his subordinates were killed or wounded. Moreover, some of his subordinates had experienced a certain incident, for which her husband was responsible, and she felt deeply burdened by it, so she decided to encourage him with her death. The so-called "certain incident" refers to anti-war riots. This is a secret that the enemy newspaper unintentionally revealed.</p>
<p>[Civil Revolutionary Society Yuji, 7th Dispatch] It is reported that enemy youths, in opposition to the invasion of China, have secretly fled from Tsushima Island to the Soviet Union in large numbers every day. Professor Kawai of the Imperial University claimed that the anti-war alliance in the enemy country is a large organization, and the conflicts between the right-wing and the young officers are also fierce. According to his observation, in July and August of this year, the working masses of Japan may take action to overthrow the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>Japan Rejects French Protest Over Forcibly Occupying Storm Island. The French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Today.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] Tokyo Telegram: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that the French Ambassador to Japan visited the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in the third quarter of this year to protest against Japan's occupation of the Spratly Islands. The protest has been rejected. When asked by reporters whether Japan would submit the matter to arbitration, the Japanese spokesman said that since Japan has already occupied the islands, it is naturally impossible to arbitrate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] Shanghai News: French Ambassador Cosme, who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the French ship "D'Artagnan", is scheduled to arrive tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>Italy Commences Armed Invasion of Albania: Troops Land in Several Locations; Anti-Italian Demonstrations Continue Throughout the Day in Albania</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 7th] An official agency here issued a communique today stating that Italian land and naval forces have taken offensive action against Albania. Italian troops left Brindisi and Bari last night, heading directly for Albania. The First Naval Fleet has been patrolling the Albanian coast between Saseno, Quaranta, and Mantu since dawn yesterday. The air force has also been ordered to mobilize. Italian ships in Durazzo and Valona have transported hundreds of Italians, including many women and children, back to Italy. The communique explains the situation, stating, "In recent days, the Italian government has been negotiating with King Zog of Albania to conclude a new agreement, but armed demonstrations in Tirana and elsewhere have endangered the lives of Italian nationals in Albania." It is reported that the Italian forces participating in the invasion of Albania consist of three divisions, approximately 35,000 men, while the Albanian standing army consists of only 12,000 men, making resistance difficult. According to a semi-official source, Italian troops have landed in Valona, Durazzo, and Mantu. It is worth noting that Italian troops have begun penetrating the Albanian interior, supported by 400 aircraft. However, they have been ordered not to attack residential areas.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 7th] According to official reports from here, Italian troops landed in the port of Durazzo in Albania on Friday morning and have already occupied the city.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Speaking in the House of Commons this morning on the Albanian issue, Chamberlain said that according to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Italian interests have been threatened. To his knowledge, "an Italian cruiser and two warships arrived in Durazzo this morning. The government is closely monitoring the development of this situation. Although Britain does not have direct interests in Albania, it has a broad interest in world peace." Chamberlain stated that he had not yet learned the purpose of the Italian warships' mission. Regarding the Italian concentration of troops in Bari or Brindisi, he had not yet received any information. Chamberlain concluded by saying that he had not received detailed information from Albania regarding the purpose of the ongoing negotiations with Italy. He had received a communication from the Albanian side denying that it had accepted conditions that contradicted its sovereignty and national integrity.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] Authoritarian nations are now embarking on new adventures. Italian warships are positioned along the Albanian coast, prepared for action. Britain has taken the following resolute retaliatory measures to resist such threats: (1) Britain has concluded a military defense alliance with Poland; (2) Three Nazi officials threatened German refugees who had emigrated to Britain, forcing them to hand over their property. The British government has expelled the Nazi officials; (3) The British government is preparing to hold negotiations with Romania to conclude a counter-aggression agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tirana, 7th] Anti-Italian demonstrations continued throughout the day here. Parliament, in session, declared that Italy's demands were unacceptable. This afternoon, 29 Italian aircraft flew over the capital, immediately triggering a large-scale demonstration by people in front of the Parliament, the Royal Palace, and foreign embassies. Demonstrators declared that Italian troops could only occupy their country after their death. The government has mobilized 26,000 men.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] The Albanian Embassy here issued a communique today, reiterating its determination to oppose the violation of Albania's independence and the landing of troops on its territory. The communique stated that the 1927 Italo-Albanian defense alliance did not provide Italy with a pretext to interfere in Albania under the guise of maintaining order. Therefore, the assertion that Italy had changed its stance should not be believed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 6th] According to official sources here, after Albania indicated that if Italy infringed upon Albanian territory, the King would abdicate and the people would unanimously resist, a compromise between Italy and Albania may be possible. Sources indicate that an agreement may be reached that respects Albanian territory. However, it is generally pointed out that if negotiations are unduly prolonged, Mussolini is prepared to take swift action.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Chamberlain Goes Fishing in Scotland; Reported in the House of Commons the Day Before on Hudson's Success in Visiting Northeast Europe</h3>

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Debates Sino-Japanese Issue; Johnson Opposes Cash-and-Carry System; Stimson Urges Improvement of Far East Relations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today heatedly debated the Sino-Japanese war issue. Senator Borah said, "I am not entirely opposed to the 'cash-and-carry' system, but under this system, we are unfairly treating China and benefiting Japan." Senator Johnson stated, "I oppose the 'cash-and-carry' system because it would make us an ally of Japan in the Pacific and an ally of Britain in the Atlantic." Pittman urged the government to adopt the "cash-and-carry" system, stating that it would not change the current situation in the Sino-Japanese war. Baruch, responding to a question from Senator Hiram Johnson, said that cutting off the supply of iron ore to Japan would not be a practical form of aid.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] US economic expert Baruch said today in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, "One cannot hope to maintain peace for long with a country subjected to economic oppression, for the nature of economic sanctions is extremely dangerous. If it fails, it will inevitably provoke war. Moreover, if an aggressor is determined to invade, economic pressure will hardly prevent the outbreak of conflict. If other countries have already begun to fight and the United States remains neutral, the 'cash-and-carry' system is most appropriate, as it avoids affecting the principles of neutrality laws. To say that Americans do not wish to fight even if their interests in the Western Hemisphere are threatened is a gross misrepresentation. Germany has already made this mistake. I firmly believe that the United States and the Western Hemisphere can avoid being drawn into European conflicts without burying their heads in the sand while loudly protesting against breaches of faith and acts of brutality." Baruch, who previously served as Chairman of the War Industries Board under President Wilson in 1918 and is now an advisor to President Roosevelt, stated that since true neutrality has become an unattainable ideal, the best course of action for the United States is to avoid becoming embroiled in war, treat belligerents fairly, and prevent economic collapse. If the American people believe they can protect the Western Hemisphere, then the argument for economic warfare will disappear. Baruch concluded by saying that world commerce, which originally flourished for peace and development, has now declined due to constant restrictions, tariffs, and other barriers. Secretary of State Hull is seeking to promote the prosperity of world trade, but current neutrality laws threaten to hinder this progress.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 6th] The Non-Participation Committee, led by former Secretary of State Stimson, today attacked Senator Pittman's proposed amendment to the neutrality laws, for the following reasons: (1) Pittman's proposal would make the United States the primary supplier of essential military supplies to Japan, so the constraints of neutrality laws would be less than they are now; (2) This would weaken China's reliance on foreign aid to obtain supplies and would prevent the United States from providing loans to China; (3) This would gradually weaken American commercial and cultural interests in China and the Pacific. The committee sent a letter to Senator Pittman, urging him to take necessary steps to improve relations in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Soviet Deputy Defense Minister's Important Speech: Prepared to Deal with Any Eventuality; Not Concerned About External Threats</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 6th] Soviet Deputy Defense Minister, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, declared today that the Soviet Union is prepared to deal with any eventuality. The Soviet Union is not concerned about external threats and does not need to conclude alliances with any foreign countries.</p>

His passing completes the work of a great statesman and patriot. With the help of his virtuous wife, he led all of Australia in a successful recovery. His death today was due to overwork and is truly regrettable."</p>

The Xinhui Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed overseas Chinese calling for the establishment of relief organizations.</p>
<p>Currently, the most important tasks of the Save-Our-Homeland movement are fundraising to provide disaster relief and mobilizing the people to protect their hometowns.</p>
<p>First, regarding overseas fundraising, we offer the following suggestions: First, it must be done in a planned and organized manner; a unified approach is essential; second, key figures must not only have strong confidence in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction but also possess high moral character and integrity; they must be respected by the government, local people, and overseas compatriots; third, all donations, large and small, must be publicly announced in a legitimate manner and deposited in reputable banks; fourth, funds should be used where they are most urgently needed, and administrative expenses should be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Second, regarding disaster relief for refugees and orphaned children, we believe that in addition to passive rescue efforts, it is essential to focus on active assistance, namely, implementing the reception, organization, and education of refugees and orphaned children, so that the vast number of refugees and orphaned children can contribute their efforts to the great cause of the War of Resistance, saving their hometown, and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>As for mobilizing the people to defend their homeland, this is the most urgent task at the current stage. First, domestically, under the leadership of the government, the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline should be universally implemented, and political mobilization work should be carried out as much as possible so that military-civilian cooperation can repel the enemy before they arrive; even when the enemy is approaching, evacuation and guerrilla warfare can be arranged calmly, avoiding the phenomenon of chaotic escapes and deaths. However, to achieve this, the realization of democratic politics is essential, including the establishment of local public opinion organs, the improvement of mobilization agencies and lower-level political organizations, and the appropriate improvement of people's livelihoods. Second, overseas, in addition to working hard to raise funds, overseas Chinese organizations and patriotic individuals should intensify efforts to mobilize young and promising overseas Chinese to return home to serve. To achieve this, the United Front of Overseas Chinese must be strengthened and developed. Everyone must put aside their differences and prejudices, trust each other, and help each other.</p>
<p>The birthplace of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, is under the threat of enemy aircraft and soldiers. Every Guangdong compatriot and Chinese citizen should implement the century-old benevolence with all our heart to defend the sacred land, to protect the homeland of our Father of the Nation, and to safeguard our own fields, houses, factories, shops, and all our property!</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Albania</h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Mussolini swallowed Abyssinia and found it a bit indigestible, not worth the effort. So now he has turned his gaze 45 degrees and wants to seize Albania. Of course, this is not an accident; everything has its historical background and current circumstances.</p>
<p>The Axis powers' conspiracy is always a give-and-take, creating a fluctuating situation on the world stage. I remember that when Italy invaded Abyssinia, all countries condemned it unanimously and advocated for sanctions, forcing Mussolini to restrain himself somewhat. But as soon as that subsided, Hitler immediately seized the opportunity to rise up and march into the Rhineland, tearing up the Treaty of Versailles. This situation has been repeated until today. Just as Germany is surrounded by the anti-German front of democratic countries and forced to retreat slightly, Italy has stepped in again, at the very least forcing Chamberlain to busy himself again.</p>
<p>The future of the situation is gradually unfolding. We would like to provide some information on Albania as a reference for future prospects.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Albania is located on the western border of the Balkan Peninsula. It covers an area of ​​approximately 17,000 square miles. It is surrounded by Yugoslavia to the northeast, bordered by Greece to the south, and faces the Adriatic Sea to the west, separated from Italy by only 85 miles.</p>
<p>Most of the country is rugged mountains and deep ravines. Flat land is scarce, with only a narrow strip along the coast. The land is not as barren as imagined, but because the Albanians have historically neglected farming, much of it is desolate. Their traditional occupation is nomadic herding, and they are now gradually moving towards handicrafts.</p>
<p>Albania is a fairly young country, established in 1913 after the First Balkan War. As early as the 9th century, the area was under Bulgarian influence, and in the 15th century, it was seized and ruled by Turkey. This continued for four or five hundred years until the First Balkan War in 1913. With the support of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was able to declare independence and formally establish a country, with the German Prince William of Wied as king.</p>
<p>When the Great War broke out, neighboring countries invaded one after another, and the country fell into chaos. Britain, France, and Russia even signed a secret agreement to divide Albania. In 1917, Italy took the opportunity to send troops to Albania, ordering the Albanians to form a republic under Italian protection. In 1920, the League of Nations formally recognized Italy's protectorate, but in 1925, all countries recognized Albania as an independent republic. However, in 1926, it was changed back to an Italian protectorate. Finally, in 1938, Italy recognized Albania as a kingdom, with the former president, Zog, becoming king. At the same time, Italy's protectorate was abolished.</p>
<p>Although this protectorate changed back and forth, in reality, everything in Albania was no different from being an Italian protectorate. The country's resources and minerals were all in Italian hands. Military and political power was in the hands of those willing to be puppets. In this way, it is difficult for Albania to do anything if Italy wants to take action. Therefore, it is rumored that the Albanian king originally intended to surrender, but now with the support of Britain and France, perhaps there will be some way. But can London's reach be swift enough? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Who Has No Native Village? Hong Kong's Various District Chambers of Commerce Launch Rescue Hometown Movements One After Another; The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry Resolved Yesterday to Urgently Form a Relief Committee; The Heshan Chamber of Commerce Sent Four Representatives Back to the County to Handle Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>After the Jiangmen battle began, Kaiping, Xinhui, Enping, Taishan, Siyi, and Zhongshan, Heshan and other counties fell into a state of tension. Previously, they suffered from rice shortages and the poor were starving. Now, coupled with the disasters of war, the people in the war zones have been scattered and displaced. The situation is even more tragic. Overseas Chinese from various counties in Hong Kong, feeling deeply for the suffering of their hometowns, have now launched rescue hometown movements one after another. For this reason, the Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry convened a special meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday to discuss the implementation methods. They immediately established the Siyi Relief Committee. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to meet today to discuss relief methods. As for the Heshan overseas Chinese, they have also sent four representatives back to their hometown to handle emergency relief. The Xinhui Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to overseas Chinese in Zhouyi yesterday, appealing for help. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Siyi Chamber of Commerce Met Yesterday to Discuss Relief</p>
<p>The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry convened a meeting at 3 pm yesterday to discuss relief for their hometowns. More than 20 people attended, including Chairman Yu Zhuosheng, Directors Qu Sen, Zhang Lanzhou, Zhou Xingchi, and Lei Yin. After the meeting began, the chairman announced the reason for the meeting and then reported that the central government had allocated 20,000 yuan and discussed how to allocate it. Liu Yuyun, Zhang Lanzhou and others spoke successively, all saying that the disaster was serious, and 20,000 yuan was just a drop in the bucket. They should continue to find ways to raise more funds. On the one hand, they should send people back to investigate the detailed situation so as to plan, etc. According to the above opinions, Zhang Lanzhou and Liu Yuyun were sent to Macau to investigate. After the investigation, they would jointly form the Siyi Relief Committee in Hong Kong with overseas Chinese from Siyi, and report the Siyi disaster situation to Acting Chairman Shi Ying, requesting his assistance in handling it and begging him to allocate more relief funds to facilitate relief. On the one hand, the chairmen of the various county chambers of commerce sent telegrams to overseas Chinese groups in their respective counties, reporting the disaster situation and urging them to send money back to provide relief immediately. Regarding the organization of the relief committee, Lei Zisun was immediately appointed as the drafting committee member, and Zhang Lanzhou, Liu Yuyun, Wu Yaoyun, and Zhou Xingchi as the preparatory committee members. Then, Zhou Xingchi proposed that the Joint Relief Association had previously handled the economic difficulties of refugees in Shenzhen and still had some relief rice left. This relief rice is still stored in Hong Kong. Now, many refugees fleeing from Siyi are flowing to Macau, suffering from hunger and cold, and urgently need relief. Can we ask the Joint Relief Association to move this rice out for distribution? The public agreed, and it was decided to send a letter to the Joint Relief Association to request it.</p>
<p>Heshan Representatives Rush Back to County for Relief</p>
<p>With the Jiangmen stalemate, the counties of Siyi are under immediate tension. Heshan has become the front line of the South China war. Overseas Chinese from Heshan in Hong Kong are extremely concerned about the suffering of their hometown. The day before yesterday (6th), a special meeting was held at the Hong Kong Heshan Chamber of Commerce to discuss emergency relief measures. It was decided to send 10,000 yuan in national currency back to the county for emergency relief. Yesterday morning (7th), four representatives were sent back to Heshan via an indirect route to engage in relief work. The representatives will return to Hong Kong as soon as their work is completed. As for the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, it is currently raising funds for emergency relief. In addition to trying to settle refugees in Macau, it also sent a telegram to overseas Chinese in Fanshi, Canada, Asia, and other ports yesterday, asking them to quickly send money back to Hong Kong for relief. The telegram said: "Our county is in danger, the military and civilians are bravely resisting, and refugees are everywhere. Please send money for relief immediately." It is found that there are many overseas Chinese from the county in the United States. If they can work together and raise huge sums of money, it will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Holds Meeting to Discuss Further Plans</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Cuba have enthusiastically donated funds to return to the country. Currently, they have remitted funds for national salvation bonds, Guangdong national defense bonds, and relief for refugees. Recently, overseas Chinese from Zhongshan in Cuba raised more than 10,000 yuan to relieve refugees in their hometown and sent three representatives, Kuang He, Huang Shaoshen, and Mo Dashao, to Hong Kong to handle the matter. The representatives have arrived in Hong Kong for many days and have allocated 5,000 yuan to the Overseas Zhongshan Compatriots Relief Association in Hong Kong to handle relief. For this reason, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce believes that with the current war in Jiangmen and the tense situation in Zhongshan, relief work is urgent. It has specifically scheduled a meeting at 3 pm today at the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce to discuss further work and invite Kuang and other representatives to report on the fundraising situation in Cuba.</p>
<p>Thousands of Refugees Have Fled to Macau</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, many refugees from Siyi have fled to Macau after the fall of Jiangmen. A portion of them have relatives in Macau who can take them in. However, those who have nowhere to live or have relatives in Hong Kong but lack the travel expenses and the 20 yuan entry guarantee fee have no choice but to wander in Macau. It is found that many refugees are gathered in various ancestral halls and temples in Macau. According to unofficial statistics, at least 3,000 refugees from Siyi have fled to Macau. Also, since the start of the battle at Tingmen, the traffic between Jiangmen and Macau has been cut off. The supply of vegetables and food that Hong Kong residents rely on for transportation and sustenance has been interrupted for a time. However, vegetables and fresh meat are still being transported because towns near Jiangmen, such as Zhanzhen, Shiqi, Xiaolan, Shunde, Jiangwei, and Gulao, are still able to change transportation routes and use the smallest waterways to directly transport goods to Macau and then to Hong Kong by boat. Because there are not many goods coming in, the prices are very expensive, especially fresh meat.</p>
<p>Postal Service in Siyi Has Been Suspended</p>
<p>Jiangmen is the outlet for all counties in Siyi. Since the war broke out there, the situation in Siyi has become tense. People from the counties in Hong Kong want to get accurate news from their hometowns and have sent letters and telegrams home to inquire. Last week, the Hong Kong Post Office still accepted mail to Jiangmen and Siyi because it had not received confirmation of the fall of Jiangmen, but it was not responsible for whether and when they would arrive. Recently, the local war has become increasingly tense. According to a reporter's investigation, the Hong Kong Post Office has recently announced that it has stopped accepting mail and postal remittances to Jiangmen and Siyi. It is not known when the receipt and delivery will resume. As for the banks in Hong Kong, which previously had dealings and remittances with banks in Jiangmen, they have also temporarily suspended remittances.</p>

<h3>Overseas Vietnamese Boy Scout Service Corps Returns to the Country Again to Serve; More Than 70 Members Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday One After Another; Bringing Back a Large Amount of Medicines to Depart for the War Zone During the Day</h3>
<p>Overseas Vietnamese Chinese youth boy scouts, concerned about the national crisis, have specifically organized a battlefield service corps to return to the country to serve. More than 50 members of the first batch returned to the country the year before last to participate in the Battle of Huizhou in Dongjiang, moving in the hail of bullets. Because of the dangerous work, the losses were quite large. After returning to Vietnam for replenishment, the corps immediately gathered comrades from the youth league branches in various provinces in Vietnam, gave them considerable training, and selected 84 qualified male members and 6 female members. Deputy Corps Leader Zhang Lupeng led 15 members to Hong Kong a few days ago. Yesterday (7th), when the Pacific Wheel arrived, Corps Leader Lin Luying and Organization Director Wu Bingji led 60 male and female members to Hong Kong, stationed in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

<h3>Many People Traveled to Macau During the Four-Day Easter Holiday; Hong Kong Ferries Were Crowded and Macau Hotels Were Fully Booked; Happy Valley Used the Osmanthus Season for Two Days of Major Horse Racing</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the annual Easter holiday. Government offices and major commercial banks in Hong Kong all had a four-day holiday starting yesterday. Usually, people in Hong Kong who get several long vacations either return to their hometowns to worship the graves of their ancestors or go to the provinces and Macau for sightseeing. However, this year, Guangdong is being ravaged by Japanese troops. Those who have fallen cannot return, and those who are still in our army are either in war zones where the flames of war are raging, lamenting that they cannot travel. Therefore, those who do not dare to forget their ancestors can only wait for the recovery of the mountains and rivers before fulfilling their filial piety.</p>
<p>Many People Travel to Macau During the Holiday</p>
<p>However, it is not appropriate to waste the four-day holiday. Therefore, there is only one way to go to Macau. Macau is also known as the second Monte Carlo of the East. The singing, dancing, wine, and women are pleasant everywhere. Those who have been working hard physically and mentally all year round can get a moment of pleasure in this place of recreation. Therefore, many people who get a holiday go on trips in groups. Fearing that there would be more demand than supply for accommodation, many people had someone reserve rooms in advance a few days ago to avoid being rejected at the last minute. High-end hotels in Macau such as "Li Wei Fang", "Dongya", "Central", "Wuzhou" etc. had all their rooms fully booked before the 5th. The Xian and Jiaotong ships that departed for Macau on the afternoon of the 8th were already crowded to the point where there was no space.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Crowding on Hong Kong-Macau Ships</p>
<p>The Taishan and Haojiang ships that departed yesterday morning were even more crowded. Before 7 o'clock, the docks and the sides of the ships were already so crowded that it was impossible to squeeze through. Unless one had reserved a seat a few days ago, it was impossible to board the stern or the hold. The Xian and Jiaotong ships that departed in the afternoon were still just as crowded. Because there are many people from government offices and major commercial banks in Hong Kong on holiday, and no fewer than 10,000 to 20,000 people are going to Macau for leisure. In addition, those who have to travel between Hong Kong and Macau for business and private affairs are even more difficult to count.</p>
<p>Christian Union Commemoration</p>
<p>Christian groups in Hong Kong jointly held a service commemorating Jesus's martyrdom at 11:30 am yesterday in an open space opposite Peace Cinema on Nathan Road, Kowloon. Salvation Army Commander Da Bi preached. At 8:30 am on the morning of the 10th, a service commemorating Christ's resurrection will be held at the Jia Lulu Mountain Huaqiu Stadium, where Dr. Wen Yuan, Secretary-General of the National Association of Chinese Christians, will preach.</p>
<p>Happy Valley Horse Racing Today</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Jockey Club is taking advantage of the holiday to hold horse racing for two days. From today and next Sunday, horses will be running from 12 noon to 12:30 pm, with two races, followed by a lunch break, and then racing again at 2:30 pm. There will be a total of ten races each day. In addition to the spring horse racing, this one is larger in scale. Jockey Li Wen fell from his horse and was injured on the first day of horse racing. Fortunately, he was treated by a Chinese doctor and fully recovered in just five weeks, and he will resume his work on horseback today. There is also a Zunchen, the son of the old foreman of Jardine Matheson, who, although a junior jockey, has good skills and has won many times in Shanghai. He will also have an excellent performance today.</p>

<h3>Giant Fishing Boat Burned and Robbed on XXX Waters; Only the Boat Owner Escaped by Swimming</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese warships have frequently wreaked havoc outside Hong Kong. On the 3rd of this month, another large fishing boat was looted by a Japanese warship in the waters of XXX and then set on fire. Of the eight crew members, only the boat owner escaped. The rest were killed, with losses amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. It is learned that the victim, Zhang Lao (30 years old), was working in the waters of XXX at about 2 pm on the 3rd of this month when a Japanese warship suddenly came roaring forward. Zhang and others were shocked and hurriedly turned to escape. Seeing the boat leaving, the Japanese warship fired several warning shots and chased after it, ordering it to stop. Seeing the fierce approach of the Japanese warship, Zhang and others dared not disobey and surrendered. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese warship approached, it shot and killed Zhang's wife. Then, it sent XX sailors swarming over Zhang's boat. First, they tied everyone up, pushed them to the bottom of the boat, and carried all the fresh fish on the boat to the Japanese warship without leaving anything behind. Zhang was tied to the stern. After looting, the Japanese warship dragged the boat out of the waters of Dan Gan Shan and poured electric fluid on it, set it on fire, and sailed away. The whole boat caught fire in an instant, and XXX was buried in deep water. Zhang desperately untied the rope and swam to escape. He floated in the sea for several hours before being rescued by a cargo boat passing by and towed back to Hong Kong. The loss this time amounted to more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Special Report of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Shattering the Traitor Theory of Surrender and Subjugation: The Newborn China (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ying Speaking at the Young Women's Christian Association</p>
<p>The above describes the situation on the front lines and in the countryside. Now, let me talk about a city we just passed through:</p>
<p>Guangxi has mobilized more than 500,000 soldiers to the front lines; it can continue to mobilize up to 2 million more. Women compatriots are very active in Guangxi, opening shops, working, women's militia training, everything seen is the brave and hardworking attitude of women.</p>
<p>The student army in Guangxi is also great. When Guangzhou fell and pessimism, wavering, and defeatist sentiments spread for a while, the Guangxi student army originally planned to recruit 1,200 people, but 11,000 people applied. If you said to him or her, "You're too young!", he would lie to you, "No, I'm 18 years old - I'm 20 years old!" Such a firm answer.</p>
<p>When they are training, they are really practicing combat, as if they are facing a great enemy.</p>
<p>The civil servants are also very clean. Everyone wears a set of cloth clothes, and the salary is very low, but the spirit is very admirable.</p>
<p>...Merchants Who Hate Traitors</p>
<p>It is even more interesting to talk about the merchants' hatred of traitors. Once, one of our group members went to a shop to buy gunpowder, preparing to use it as artillery fire to perform the "Battle of Taierzhuang." The shopkeeper told our comrade to wait, and he quietly went to inform a group of policemen to arrest him - saying that if he was not a traitor, why would he buy gunpowder? After many explanations, the arrested comrade was released, but the shopkeeper still didn't believe it and sold us gunpowder that didn't work. When it didn't catch fire on stage, we were really anxious! The next day, we personally went to the shop to explain the details and invited him to watch the play. He realized that this was for saving the country, so he quickly sent a lot of real gunpowder. How touching is this patriotic merchant who hates traitors - is this progressive fact of the common people not one of thousands?</p>
<p>Guilin was the most tragic city after being crazily bombed by the Japanese. At least two-thirds of the houses were turned into rubble. However, the people of Guangxi calmly responded. When Japanese planes came, they ran to the caves. When the Japanese planes left, they picked out some usable utensils from a scorched earth and built reed mats. After two or three days, business was resumed. Not only did it not shake their faith, and there was no pessimism. And it strengthened the anger of common hatred. As for commerce, it is as prosperous as usual. This prosperity is not the prosperity of the city, but the prosperity that symbolizes that China has infinite hope.</p>
<p>...Admirable Air Force Soldiers</p>
<p>Speaking of the army, the most advanced is the air force. Many of my friends are in the air force, and we are often together, so I know it in detail. They are all strong and handsome. In Hengyang, they once used one plane to fight against twenty-seven Japanese planes, and as a result, they shot down two Japanese planes, and they themselves were injured and forced to land.</p>
<p>When it was most dangerous, he was unwilling to parachute to escape, but insisted on colliding with the Japanese plane, causing them to perish together. When they set off to bomb the Japanese warships, they had already written their wills, using their own bodies, using their own planes, and heroically destroying the Japanese warships, showing the Japanese our Chinese nation's soul with a heroic sacrifice.</p>
<p>In Luoyang, I saw that when our aviation personnel took off to chase Japanese planes, none of them had any expression, only silence. This silence is not a sad silence, but a resolute silence. They didn't speak, and they had already decided in their hearts that they would never come back.</p>
<p>...The Optimism of the Soldiers</p>
<p>From the overall military situation, the quality of our army has made rapid progress.</p>
<p>On the front lines, I often saw soldiers lying down in the haystack to sleep during air raids. When the Japanese planes left, they picked up their machine guns and marched while singing and laughing, showing a very optimistic state of mind. If anyone said to our soldiers and people on the front lines that they wanted to make peace with the Japanese, he would immediately be hit mercilessly. As long as you have been to the front lines, you will definitely not be able to say the word "peace." China's ambition can only be believed if you have seen it with your own eyes.</p>
<p>...The Battle Situation After the Fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems that we are very difficult after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou. In fact, only because of the fall, we have changed from a passive position to an active position: before the fall, we had to accumulate a lot of strength at a central point and wait for the Japanese to attack with superior artillery fire. Now, when we attack a point, the Japanese have to fight back at that point, making him stuck in the mud and not knowing what to do. The cities occupied by the Japanese have absolutely no way to walk ten or twenty miles. This is a true fact in many cities.</p>
<p>In many cities, our entire military and civilians withdrew and let the Japanese enter. Then, we surrounded the Japanese from all directions, making the Japanese feel deeply difficult. If the Japanese reinforcements arrive, it will form a stalemate. Some people become frustrated and pessimistic after hearing about the loss of a city. This is completely because they do not know the real situation. What we are fighting for is not points and lines, but the entire surface. To win the victory of the all-out war of resistance, we must not divide men and women, old and young, or divide north and south, east and west. Military, political, economic, and cultural must all be all-out war of resistance.</p>
<p>...The Japanese Are At The End Of Their Rope</p>
<p>The Japanese's dream was initially to win without fighting. After we fought without surrendering, it was changed to a quick battle and quick decision. After we insisted on the war of resistance, it was changed to a quick peace and quick decision. After the serious blow of our resistance to the end, they talked about a hundred-year war to prop up their faces. This is a symbol of the Japanese's exhaustion. We will never stop this war until we drive the Japanese out of our territory. It is also absolutely possible to drive the Japanese out of our territory.</p>
<p>...Contribute Everything To The Motherland</p>
<p>Finally, I want to end with a story: In France, a juggler and a preacher went to a small chapel. The juggler desperately somersaulted and played combat methods in the auditorium. The preacher asked him why he did this? He said proudly: I have no other ability to contribute to God, all I have is my profession of somersaulting and playing tricks, in order to express his sincere and reverence for God.</p>
<p>Like this story, I myself use drama to dedicate to the motherland. You are the same, everyone has his own position and can serve the motherland.</p>
<p>When we came to Hong Kong this time, we often heard some friends say: "We are very ashamed in Hong Kong. We are really not as good as you who serve on the front lines." In fact, working in Hong Kong is equally important. We also admire the hardworking comrades. Goodbye.</p>
<p>——Everyone was very moved and followed "Goodbye" to disperse. But they still seemed reluctant to leave. These examples are living examples, not the "examples" cited by Wang Jingwei for Konoe. Excitement and emotion occupy the individual's mood and actively dominate everyone's future behavior. (End of continuation)</p>

<h3>Women's Disaster Relief Association Holds Welcome Meeting for the China National Salvation Drama Troupe at the Kyoto Hotel Yesterday - A Meeting of Comrades, a Meeting for Work!</h3>
<p>— Huo Xi</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Hong Kong China Women's Disaster Relief Association held a tea party to welcome all the members of the China National Salvation Drama Troupe. All twenty-four of them (with a few absent due to other commitments), men, women, and children, including generals who had participated in the War of Resistance, all arrived punctually in neat and simple new attire, full of energy.</p>
<p>The venue was the grand ballroom on the sixth floor of the Kyoto Hotel, also a delicately decorated dance hall. The elegant musical instruments were still placed on the central platform. To the eyes of these workers from the front lines, accustomed to the broken houses and thatched huts of the front lines, this was simply another world. However, the hosts intended to make the comrades of the troupe feel comfortable and relaxed, as a small token of their appreciation.</p>
<p>More than ten hosts from the Women's Disaster Relief Association, the twenty-four members of the drama troupe, and over ten distinguished guests from the cultural, film, and drama circles, such as Cai Chusheng and Li Jianwu, attended the welcome. Everyone gathered around a rectangular table. Chairman Liu Qingxuan gave a sincere speech:</p>
<p>"Since our Sacred War of Resistance began twenty months ago, whether on the front lines or in the rear, all of our outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, and those who refuse to be slaves of a conquered nation, have united to participate in the War of Resistance and diligently engage in various salvation efforts. This demonstrates that our Chinese nation will never perish, and it further demonstrates that our War of Resistance will ultimately be victorious. This time, the China National Salvation Drama Troupe, to expand publicity and advocate for the soldiers on the front lines, has decided to go abroad for propaganda. Passing through Hong Kong, we received letters of introduction from Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, which allowed us to understand more deeply the efforts and dedication of the troupe and its leaders: Mr. Jin Shan, Ms. Wang Ying, and Mr. Lin Shu, the head of the Guangdong Student Army, are among the bravest and most dedicated workers. In the future, their overseas promotion will undoubtedly have immeasurable effects. Besides admiration and inspiration, we also hope that we will work together with one heart and unite to cooperate and complete the great task of building our nation as soon as possible."</p>
<p>After the chairman's speech, she invited the head of the drama troupe, Mr. Jin Shan, to speak, and Mr. Fu Guang was invited to translate it into Cantonese:</p>
<p>"Before we arrived in Hong Kong, we had long admired the patriotism of the Hong Kong China Women's Disaster Relief Association. Generals Li and Bai had spoken of your efforts. General Yu Hanmou sent a ambulance this time to transport us from Shaoguan to Chaoan. This large vehicle was a donation from the Women's Disaster Relief Association. We feel ashamed and fortunate. We should express our gratitude here.</p>
<p>"Our meeting this time is a meeting of comrades, a meeting for work. Our trip abroad for propaganda is a pre-planned and consistent effort. If the War of Resistance is not victorious, our work will not stop. Although our time to stay in Hong Kong for sorting and preparation is only one or two months, we will not give up our responsibility here. If the Women's Disaster Relief Association and other salvation groups need us to do any work, we will do our best, because our mission is the same goal.</p>
<p>"The first goal of our trip abroad is to tell our allies about our vivid experiences over the past year, explaining that China will absolutely not perish; to tell our overseas compatriots that their past efforts to contribute money and effort will absolutely not be in vain, and will surely be rewarded in the future.</p>
<p>"Secondly, we want to mobilize more overseas compatriots to actively transport supplies and donate funds back to the country to establish military hospitals and nurse vehicles. That's why I say that meeting with the comrades of the Women's Disaster Relief Association is a meeting of comrades, a meeting for work. It is very appropriate. In the future, we hope to have more contact in our work."</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Shan's speech was followed by Mr. Lin Shu, who spoke in Cantonese: "We received cotton vests and comfort bags donated by women's organizations at the front line, which were very much needed and greatly appreciated. The ambulance I took when I was wounded was also donated by your women's organizations. I deeply feel that the blood of the front lines and the sweat of the rear will converge and bloom into the flower of freedom for the Chinese nation." – The whole audience applauded in agreement. Mr. Mu used his experience in the War of Resistance to explain that final victory will surely be achieved.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ying also gave a speech, which was translated by Mr. Fu Guang. Ms. Wang gave an impassioned speech about the relationship between the War of Resistance and women. The main point was: Now our women and men are participating together in the sacred work of the War of Resistance. The problem of women being bound and oppressed for more than 5,000 years can be solved. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we women can achieve true liberation and complete liberation. This is a very correct and insightful point of view, and I hope that female compatriots who demand liberation will keep it firmly in mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Chusheng was also warmly welcomed to express his views. After summarizing the opinions of the previous three speakers, he hoped that enlightened women would mobilize women from all walks of life and awaken the group that is indulging in a life of pleasure and death. He also said that we should learn from the China National Salvation Drama Troupe. They are fighting on the front lines, and we must be their rearguard, working together hand in hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jianwu said that in the past, most movie stars were despised because they lived a decadent life. However, the two stars, Jin Shan and Wang Ying, not only did not go along with the tide, but also kicked away a comfortable life with progressive thinking, creating a path for the film industry and fighting hard to save the country from destruction. This spirit is not only worthy of admiration by the general film and drama industry, but also deserves deep gratitude from our cultural workers.</p>
<p>After that, Fan Zheng, a child from the Salvation Drama Troupe, reported on the progress of the children's movement in the country. He is from the Northeast and is only thirteen years old this year. He has traveled many places and done many jobs in the New An Travel Troupe. He looks very innocent and lively, and speaks accurate and fluent Mandarin. This young warrior's thoughts, attitude, spirit… all aroused people's interest and deeply moved them. The atmosphere of the whole venue also became lively and warm, which is a symbol of the unlimited bright future of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Finally, Ms. Liu Qingxuan gave a reply, expressing her gratitude and stating her willingness to do her best to help the National Salvation Drama Troupe and establish close ties with the troupe in their work.</p>
<p>Even if they were tired, everyone was still chatting and encouraging each other, calling themselves outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. A meeting of comrades, a meeting for work, this was a rare opportunity.</p>

<h3>War Situation in the Lower Reaches of the Xijiang River: Counter-Offensives Launched Everywhere; Hui City Recaptured on the 5th; Taishan Guanghai Gradually Tightening; Our Forces Pursue the Victory and Engage in Fierce Battles in Ningyang; Shaping Has Been Recaptured; Longkou Remains in Our Hands</h3>
<p>[Macau Special Dispatch] Since the enemy troops occupied Jiangmen and Xinhui, they have continued to transfer a large number of troops from the Guangzhou-Sanshui route to advance towards Taishan and Shaping, attempting to occupy Enping to control the southern route. They have also dispatched more than twenty large and small enemy warships to sail to Taishan Guanghai, and at the same time sent multiple aircraft to bombard Taishan wildly, attempting to force our military authorities into submission with the power of their naval, land, and air forces. Our military authorities, aware of the enemy's plot, have also actively dispatched various units to meet them on separate routes.</p>
<p>Recapturing Hui City When our troops withdrew from Hui City, they gathered in the suburban gentry lands to prepare for a counter-offensive. On the 4th, our reinforcements arrived and immediately joined forces with the Guangxi Army and the Fifth District Guerrilla Regiment to launch a counter-offensive against Hui City. At 2 PM that afternoon, they engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy at Gangguifeng Mountain. After a three-hour battle, many enemies were killed, and the enemy, unable to withstand the assault, retreated towards Hui City. Our troops simultaneously recaptured Yulesheng Dushan. On the 5th, our forces jointly besieged Hui City, with one route advancing eastward along the Ningyang Road and another route advancing southward along the Gangchuan Road, attacking Hui City from both front and rear. The enemy stubbornly resisted at the northeast railway station, resulting in a fierce battle. Our troops engaged in close combat, bravely charging forward. By 7 PM, we had captured the east station in one fell swoop. Because the enemy was unfamiliar with the terrain, their formation was in chaos. Our troops rushed into Hui City and engaged in street fighting throughout the night. The enemy retreated in confusion towards the Ningyang and Huazhan area. Hui City was then recaptured by our troops, who are still resisting in the north station area.</p>
<p>Chaos in Jiangmen In the vicinity of Jiangmen, our troops have engaged in fierce battles in Shuanglong, Jiaotou, Baolian Gang, Zini, Diaoyutai, and the Jiang-Foshan Road area for several days. The battles on the 4th and 5th were particularly intense, especially in Jiaotou. Many houses in these areas were destroyed by artillery fire, and corpses were scattered everywhere. It is estimated that the enemy has deployed more than a thousand vehicles and aircraft. According to refugees from Jiangmen seeking refuge in Hong Kong, who were hired by the enemy to move corpses, the number of enemy corpses left in Jiangmen was extremely large. The enemy troops were unable to clean them up, so they went around pulling in three to four hundred of our civilians to transport the corpses for them, transporting more than eight hundred bodies to Guangzhou for cremation. Fierce battles are still ongoing. The Jiaotou militia has always been known for their bravery. Previously, an enemy unit of about a hundred men, led by a lieutenant, detoured through Tangxia and Jiaotou to Jiangmen. Our Jiaotou team, stationed in both places, had more than six hundred men. They had set up ambushes in four directions in advance. When the enemy troops passed by, they did not make a sound. After the enemy troops had reached the appropriate location, they quickly launched an attack together. It was midnight, and the enemy was terrified. We then used hand grenades and bayonets to engage in close combat, capturing ninety-nine men on the spot. The rest were killed, and no one survived. In this battle, an estimated three hundred enemy soldiers were annihilated, and more than two hundred rifles, five machine guns, three small steel mortars, and countless bullets were captured. Japanese Ichiro, the captain of the Jinze team, was also killed.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Shaping Before the enemy entered Shaping, our villagers, filled with righteous indignation, rose up to resist the enemy and donated all the pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks in their homes to the defense forces to prevent them from being used by the enemy. Our troops were all extraordinarily motivated, vowing to fight the enemy to the death. They soon recaptured Shaping. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in Shaping and could not gain a foothold. Longkou has never been captured by the enemy.</p>
<p>Taishan is Becoming Tense The situation in Taishan is also tense. On the 5th, enemy warships in Guanghai agitated towards Chixi, Xinhui, and cruised and spied outside Hutiaomen and Anmenkou. However, because our authorities had tightly blockaded Yamen in advance, the warships could not sail up the river, and the enemy ships retreated, not daring to act rashly. The enemy's ambitions have not diminished, and they have transferred enemy warships back to Taishan. As of the 6th, there were more than twenty enemy warships, dozens of speedboats, and armed fishing boats nesting in the waters of Chikan, Taishan, patrolling and spying, looking for an opportunity to land. At around 4 PM on the 6th, more than ten enemy speedboats, carrying hundreds of enemy soldiers, used enemy warship artillery fire as cover to advance south along the Nanhai Shadi coast, attempting to cross our defense line and land. Our coastal guards and security teams used machine guns and artillery to form a human net and bravely counterattack, engaging in a fierce sea battle with the enemy. The enemy boats could not get closer, but their ambition to land did not diminish slightly, and the situation was extraordinarily serious.</p>
<h3>Our Guerrilla Team Attacks the Street Edge Station; Enemy Soldiers Wake Up in a Dream, But It's Too Late; Flames Soar, Enemy Camp Burned Down</h3>
<p>[Nanhai Quick News] The enemy troops entrenched along the Guangzhou-Sanshui line and the Foshan-Zhaoqing line, due to the tense war situation, continued to transfer to Dalang, Ronggui, Jiangmen, and other places to provide reinforcements. Therefore, the enemy's defenses there were extremely empty. Our guerrilla team nearby took the opportunity to actively contain the enemy. In recent days, they have been dispatched from their hidden locations to attack the teams, attacking the enemy. On the night of the 2nd of this month, the spring was full of atmosphere and the cold wind was bitter. More than 200 members of our guerrilla team, lurking near the streets and manning by the female captain Suo Qin (i.e. Blind Qin), stealthily approached the street edge station in the dark. When they arrived, each team placed dozens of loads of wood and grass soaked with large amounts of kerosene near the station. At a signal, they not only set the fire, but also used machine guns and hand grenades to sweep the dense enemy camp. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and the enemy soldiers woke up from their dreams in panic. Because the north wind was strong, the fire spread rapidly, and the enemy camp was burned down in an instant. The enemy soldiers fled in panic, and our ambush troops lurking nearby also rose up to engage in close combat with the enemy. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy troops stationed in Zhangcha heard the news and dispatched troops to reinforce them. When they arrived, our guerrilla team had already retreated calmly. In this battle, in addition to destroying the street edge station and an enemy camp, capturing several long and short guns and enemy flags, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed and burned. Our guerrilla team also made eight heroic sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Reclamation of Nanshan Has Achieved Results; Education and Agriculture Have Both Improved; Receiving Refugees is Underway</h3>
<p>[Shantou Quick News] Nanshan is a military reclamation area. Since Huang Duanru took over as the director of the administration, he has been actively rectifying idle reclamation, afforestation, animal husbandry, and mining, with remarkable results. Yesterday, the director came to Shantou on official business. When our reporter heard the news, he made a special visit to ask about the situation of managing the reclamation of Nanshan. Director Huang gave a detailed account, which is recorded as follows: Mr. Huang said that regarding the start of Nanshan, after I took office, the work I started can be roughly divided into three aspects: (1) reclamation and rectification of agriculture, (2) rectification of education, (3) receiving refugees. Regarding the reclamation business, after several industrialists went to inspect it recently, two companies have been formally established and started operations, reclaiming, afforestation, animal husbandry, and mining, with a capital of about 200,000 yuan each. The rectification of the agricultural industry is urged by the administration to increase the rice fields of farmers by more than a thousand acres. If the weather is favorable, the early rice harvest this year can increase by several thousand dans, which is a great help to the local food supply. In terms of education, many rural primary schools and short-term primary schools were closed in the past. After I took office, I considered education in the rear during the war to be very important, and urgently requested the provincial government to allocate funds. After the provincial government approved it, I started to rectify it, and all have been restored. At present, there are 42 rural primary schools, 16 short-term schools, and one middle school in the entire district. This middle school did not have dormitories in the past. After I took office, I was determined to build them. Now, I am designing and raising funds, and construction has already started, so as to accommodate refugees. Recently, I received an order from the provincial government to find ways to accommodate a number of refugees, but due to business relations, I can only accommodate one-third of them for the time being. Among those who are accommodated, I will set up jobs to make them engage in reclamation.</p>
<h3>After the Recapture of Shaping, the Traitors are Strictly Arrested; More Than One Hundred and Twenty People Captured</h3>
<p>[Shiki Quick News] After our army recaptured Shaping, in addition to actively deploying defenses, monitoring the threat from Jiujiang, and suppressing the enemy, we also hired workers to start to organize the town's appearance, and to comfort the displaced people. At the same time, because shameless traitors were hiding in the town, Commander Deng Jun was afraid that they would harm the country and the village again, so he ordered a strict arrest. As of the evening of the 5th, more than one hundred and twenty people were arrested, and they were escorted by the defense army to the headquarters of the XXX Army for interrogation and strict punishment.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Overseas Chinese Puppet Chamber of Commerce Forcibly Collects Security Donations; Citizens Angrily Riot and Destroy the Puppet Association</h3>
<p>[Panyu Quick News] After the Shiqiao puppet Chamber of Commerce was established, it was ordered by the enemy to pay five hundred yuan in military pay every day. The Chamber of Commerce then forced all stores in the city to pay two yuan in tax every day, euphemistically calling it "security donation." The people of Shiqiao were very frustrated because business was very sluggish and they were closing down one after another. For a time, 70-80% of the stores in Shiqiao closed. The puppet Chamber of Commerce could not collect security donations, and the enemy was pressing hard. He, the chairman of the puppet Chamber of Commerce, could not afford to let it go, so he convened a meeting of puppet committee members and business representatives on the 2nd of this month to discuss a solution. The merchants and people were angry. Huang and Dai, Hua merchants from the Xin Chang Copper and Iron Shop and the Xiang Ji Restaurant in the city, were particularly angry. They hid sharp weapons and went to the meeting. During the meeting, they pulled out the sharp weapons and stabbed the puppets who were present. The order was disrupted. Huang and Dai took the opportunity to escape from the back garden of the association. By the time the enemy soldiers arrived, they could not be captured. It is reported that four or five members of the puppet Chamber of Commerce were injured, including He and Li, and more than six hundred yuan was lost.</p>
<h3>Yuan Dai Talks About the Tranquility of Various Places in Zhongshan; The Fall of Xiaolan and the Landing at Dieshi are Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Xiaolan Quick News] Since the bloody battle in Xinhui began, the enemy has tried to contain us by harassing various places in the ninth district of Zhongshan, Dahuangpu in the third district, and Xiaolan. However, our defenses are very solid, preventing the enemy from succeeding. In recent days, all parts of the county have been very peaceful. Our reporter met Yuan Dai, the commander of the mobile team of the first district, yesterday. According to him, since Jiangmen fell, the ninth and third districts of Zhongshan have been adjacent to Xinhui and Shunde, so they have been slightly affected. However, the guerrilla defenses of Zhongshan are well-organized, so the enemy cannot take advantage of them. Every time the enemy raids, they are defeated by our teams and cannot succeed. The recent rumors that enemy shallow ships sailed from Wugui Hill to Dieshi, sent troops to land, and attempted to invade Shiqi are all false. They are actually rumors made by shameless traitors. At that time, because the enemy was attacking Jiangmen, enemy ships were cruising here for cover, and then they immediately sailed back to the Tianhe River. It is even more ridiculous to say that Xiaolan has fallen. Previously, the enemy troops stationed in Dongma Ning once sent troops to invade, but they were bravely blocked by our teams and immediately retreated, leaving countless corpses behind. At present, various places in Zhongshan, such as Dahuangpu, Huanggang, Xiaolan, Guzhen, and Dieshi, are very quiet, and the enemy does not dare to disturb them. There are also no enemy ships in the waters of Tangjiawan and Hongao. Water and land transportation in Xiaolan, Shiqi, and Qiguan Road is also as usual.</p>
<h3>Amidst the General Counter-Offensive of Guangdong, Our Eastern Route is Making Full Progress; The Three Routes of Counter-Offensive in Dongguan Cut Off the Connection Between Wan and Tai; Artillery Exerts its Power to Cover the Army's Advance to Zengcheng; Our Air Force Displays Great Power and Fiercely Bombs Enemy Positions and Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Quick News] The military counter-offensive in Guangdong Province, after five months of preparation, has matured. According to military sources, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui, with all military forces properly deployed, issued an order for a full-scale general counter-offensive yesterday evening, the 5th, directing all the major armies on the east, west, and north routes to advance towards Guangzhou, and ordering the Fifth Attack Detachment Commander to supervise the attack detachments, cooperate with the masses to launch widespread guerrilla warfare, and assist the regular army in the counter-offensive. The commanders of the north route, Yu Hanmou and Ye Zhao, the commander-in-chief of the west route, Xia Wei and Deng Longguang, and the commanders of the east route, Wu Qiwu and Ou Zhen, were ordered to lead their respective armies, with Guangzhou as their target, to attack the enemy entrenched in Huaxian, Conghua, Zengcheng, Sanshui, and Dongguan. On the north route, our army had captured important strongholds such as Xinjie in the county, Taipingchang in Conghua, Nan'an, Shijiao, and Yangcun by the evening of the 6th. On the west route, our army had also crossed the river on multiple routes on the morning of the 6th to counter-attack Sanshui, capturing Guanyao. All the above routes have made great progress. On the east route, our army, relying on Luofu Mountain, pounced on Zengcheng, with the force of bamboo, drumming bravely westward. The force is strong and the momentum is strong. The situation of the full-scale general offensive is changing rapidly, and there will be even greater performances in the near future to comfort our Guangdong people. Now, the report of the East Route Army is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Our Army Counter-Attacks Dongguan on Three Routes</p>
<p>Upon receiving the general offensive order, the commanders of the east route, Wu Qiwu and Ou Zhen, immediately supervised their troops and vehicles to advance towards Dongguan County. On the south bank of the Dongjiang River, the central army's Wu troops, the independent detachment of the Fourth District Guerrilla Team's Yuan troops, and the third battalion of the Second District Guerrilla Column's Luo troops were divided into three routes to attack the enemy in Dongguan, Shilong, and Taiping. Huo Rongji, the commander of the Dongjiang South Bank, Wang Ruozhou, the commander of the Third District Guerrilla Column, and Zhang Wodong had already mobilized and set off overnight on the 5th to supervise the battle on the front line. Another staff officer, Deng Xiang, was sent to be responsible for the liaison between the various military forces. It is now found that our army has obliquely exited the Ling Mountain and Xiashanmen, directly approaching Chiling, destroying the Tai-Gong highway, and cutting off the connection between Dongguan and Taiping in order to cut off the enemy's rear. The left wing exited Huangsonggang and Xiaobian, destroying the Bao-Tai highway and suppressing Taiping. The right wing occupied the west side of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and advanced towards the Nanshe and Chashan area. It has broken through the enemy's alert line. Another unit crossed the north bank of the Dongjiang River, crossed Masi, and went south to attack Youlong from both sides. At the same time, it also blocked the Qishi River in the lower reaches of Dongguan to prevent the enemy from using it to advance eastward, and sent hundreds of commando reconnaissance team members to mix into Shizhai, Taiping, and Dongguan to respond to our army's counter-attack. On the evening of the 4th and 5th, our commando team had carried out many activities, using large hand grenades to kill dozens of enemy soldiers and traitors. On the evening of the 6th, the vanguard of our army had reached the enemy's defense line and made contact, and a great battle was imminent.</p>
<p>Crossing the Zeng River and Assaulting Zengcheng</p>
<p>According to front-line military reports, the main force of Wu Qiwu's army on the east route had all joined the front line, and the foothills of Luofu Mountain were filled with our counter-attacking army, launching an offensive and advancing towards Zengcheng step by step. The commander of the Third Attack Column, Luo Fengxiang, and the commander of the Dongjiang Special Operations Team, Liang Xia, also dispatched Lin Junsheng's troops along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway, occupying the Zhuguling line, six miles northeast of Zengcheng, and carrying out active ambush attacks to respond to the attack on the enemy. On the 3rd, the enemy in the Hulong area attached to Zengcheng tried to break through our encirclement line, and sent more than 200 infantry and cavalry, with two cannons, to attack the Hulu Hill where our army was stationed. It was severely attacked by a regiment of the 12th Army Group guarding the area, and the remnant enemy retreated to Zengcheng. Now our army is sweeping forward, seeking to eliminate the stubborn enemy in one fell swoop. In recent days, plainclothes teams have been sent out to mix into the Snake Ridge and Guanyin Pavilion in the suburbs of Zengcheng to contain our army's counter-attack. On the 4th and 5th, the artillery positions of our army in the east of the Zeng River and the foothills of Luofu Mountain exerted their power, firing artillery towards the enemy in Zengcheng all day long, covering our army's crossing of the Zeng River and advancing towards Zengcheng. The enemy also fired artillery to resist stubbornly, so a fierce artillery battle broke out. Our army's spirit is strong and the battle is fierce. It is said that the enemy in Zengcheng has become panicked, concentrating its main force in the suburbs, preparing to defend stubbornly.</p>
<p>Our New Air Force Displays Great Power</p>
<p>The Air Force, which has come south to assist in the counter-offensive, has launched many attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and establishing miraculous achievements. After our general offensive order was issued on the 6th, it became even more active. On the 5th, ten of our aircraft flew to Dongguan, Taiping, Shilong, Shitan and other places, and with acute postures, fiercely bombed the enemy's positions at various points, dropping twenty or thirty bombs, destroying most of the enemy's positions. The greatest effect was achieved in Shitan and Shilong. Whenever our aircraft flew over Dongguan, the enemy troops in various places were frightened and fled in panic, not daring to resist. Our aircraft slowly circled and selected the target, accurately dropping bombs. On the morning of the 6th, another squadron of our aircraft went to the waters of Humen and Taiping to hunt down enemy ships. At that time, more than ten enemy ships and boats were gathering in the waters of Humen Dachan. As soon as they saw our aircraft, they fled and released smoke screens to cover their escape. Our pilots immediately observed clearly and flew low to drop bombs, continuing to drop more than a dozen bombs in about a minute, destroying an enemy ship and two enemy armed fishing boats, achieving great results. After our army completed its mission, it flew back to its position.</p>
<p>Film and Drama</p>
<h3>First Round New Movie Introduction - Floating Life Like a Dream</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Frank Capra's "Secrets of the Louvre" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," we shouldn't be unfamiliar with them, right? Now, "You Can't Take It With You" is another one of his works. There are many characters in the entire drama, and the acting opportunities are also very evenly distributed. The general idea of the plot is about a family. The grandfather, Wen Chihe (played by Lionel Barrymore), is an old man who used to do business and has accumulated wealth. Because he suddenly feels that he lacks the true meaning of life in the arena where he runs for fame and fortune all day long, he retires to his hometown and lives with his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughters to enjoy his old age. His daughter, Ni, is typing non-stop all day long. She seems very busy, but she does not aspire to be a famous writer. The reason why she types is simply because someone mistakenly sent her a typewriter eight years ago, and she just likes to use it. Her husband, Paul, tirelessly studies firework manufacturing methods, and his comrade, Di Pina (played by Halliwell Hobbes), both work hard, not because they can sell them, but simply because this is their interest. The granddaughter, Bian Miao (played by Ann Miller), stays at home every day, never taking off her dance shoes. She has never been and has no hope of performing on stage in the past, but she still hired a former boxing instructor (played by Mischa Auer) to guide her in dancing. Her husband also doesn't go out to work, and spends all day studying printing and playing the dulcimer. Among such a crazy and silly family, only one has a job, which is another granddaughter, Ya Lisi (played by Jean Arthur). Niu works as a secretary under Tony (played by James Stewart), the son of a big entrepreneur, Anthony (played by Edward Arnold), but she doesn't take this job seriously. She and Tony fall in love and secretly get engaged. One day, Ya Lisi invites Tang and his parents to her house for dinner, but Tony deliberately takes his parents to her house a day earlier, and when they are unprepared, they see this family's unpretentious life. However, this nature will naturally not satisfy Tony's parents. Of course, after a series of twists and turns, this couple finally gets what they want, and the whole family is reunited. The whole film is filled with laughter, but if we treat this film as a comedy, it is more like a satirical film. Perhaps this is also a characteristic of Frank Capra's films. He always makes people able to savor another kind of taste after laughing.</p>
<p>The dialogue of the whole film is very brilliant, especially the words spoken by Leon Barrymore, such as his criticism of the popular doctrine frenzy, telling Qin Yase about his early love history, and the conversation with the income tax collectors, those are all gimmicks that attract people to laugh, but they are all extremely meaningful.</p>
<p>Qin Yase is not very outstanding in this film, probably because the character in the play does not match her personality. James Stewart still retains his unique and undivided appearance. Edward Menno's performance as a big entrepreneur is of course the most suitable. Especially later, when he and the Wen Chihe family played the harmonica, the expression was truly perfect. The others were all wonderful. Watching this film makes us believe that a film cannot be completed by two or three headlining stars. The screenwriter, director, and even every actor cannot be neglected.</p>
<p>In addition, the angle of the entire screen is exceptionally good, which is also Frank Capra's old trick.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a film worth watching. His winning the award is by no means accidental.</p>
<h3>Trivial Matters That Make Several Stars Regretful: A Momentary Mistake Unforgettable for Life</h3>
<p>What people fear most is the discovery of conscience, because the spiritual impact is often more unbearable than physical punishment. This is what is meant by "a momentary mistake, regret for eternity." What can most easily make us repent of our behavior is often not the intentional evildoing, but rather the unintentional negligence. For example, a military criminal who went to jail for many years for embezzling huge sums of public funds does not regret the fault of using people's money, but he deeply regrets that he did not fulfill his promise to give a small employee a pension when he was a foreman.</p>
<p>The big stars of Hollywood also have the same facts. Their life's great regrets are often unimaginable to ordinary movie fans.</p>
<p>A certain producer asked the female star, Gan Er Pandelie, to have dinner on Sunday and asked his female secretary to call Gan Er. When the pliers were given to Er, Qian Er asked her, "Is it a formal banquet? Do I need a dress?" The female secretary replied, "It's not a formal banquet, you don't need to wear one." So when the day came, Gan Er went in casual clothes, but I didn't know that when I arrived there, I saw that the female guests were all wearing dresses, and my eyes were definitely formal banquets. Of course she felt very embarrassed. Therefore, she explained to Shangren about her questioning the female secretary. The number producer immediately dismissed her and apologized to Gan. After thinking about this matter, Gan Er regretted it very much, because she said a true word in order to save her own face, and did not think that the female secretary would lose her job because of this. The next day, although she interceded with a certain producer for the female secretary, it was in vain. Therefore, she still regrets it very much when she thinks about it. She said, "Although there are many things I have done that are inevitably subject to severe criticism, I will not forgive myself for the sin of selling people for a wife because of this."</p>
<p>Betty Davis and Hanna Er met and traveled together, but because everyone was burdened with their duties, they did not realize their dreams for a long time. Later, one time they both unexpectedly did not film, so they were overjoyed to pack some luggage, take a car and go together. Of course, there was endless beautiful scenery all the way until they reached their destination. In a hotel, because it was full, they couldn't find a seat for a while, so she quarreled with a waiter. Nelson persuaded her not to listen, but the result was drinking without drinking, defeated and returned. However, Davis later regretted her impulsiveness very much, turning such a happy outing into an unpleasant day of regret for life. I don't know if they can still afford it after they broke up.</p>
<p>Diana Ping also had a regret in her life. According to her, it was still four or five years ago. One day, she came back from school and ran into a movie theater with a classmate to watch a movie. She thought at the time that her mother was going to be in the association until 7 o'clock before returning home. Unfortunately, her mother did not go to the meeting that day. When she saw Diana Dou was still not back after 4 o'clock, she called around to ask, and on the one hand, she sent people to look around. Later, when the theater was over, she learned from her father's mouth that her mother had been frightened. Although she was not scolded when she went back, she still felt uneasy.</p>
<h3>MGM's Shanghai Representative Talks About Shanghai Audiences</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for MGM's office in Shanghai recently made a statement to reporters from the mainland, stating the Shanghai film audiences' inclinations towards the company's films and stars. Because what he said was not without considerable insight, the author has translated the spokesperson's statements below to inform readers in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>"The most important thing that general Chinese film audiences value about American stars is action. Perhaps the only reason is that action is the easiest to understand in a film. Even those who don't understand English dialogue can understand the plot of the whole film by watching the actors' actions," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"For example, Chinese moviegoers are very welcome to musical comedies," the spokesperson continued, "These kinds of films usually have a very simple story structure, and in addition to inserting music, the scenery is quite bizarre and magnificent."</p>
<p>"However, you will never know when these films are released," he said, "Sometimes the crowding of the audience will surprise you. To give an example, 'Marie Antoinette' has this tendency."</p>

<h3>Today's Special Silver Plate Final: South China and South Vow to Win the Championship; Police Also Harbor Ambition and Resolve to Do Everything to Win; The Outcome of the Group B American Military vs. Tugger is Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Special Silver Plate Football Tournament is the most historic of the six major championships. The first edition was in 1897, and the British warship Sunderland team won the championship.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, South China has had good luck with the Silver Plate, winning the championship seven times. In particular, South China has won three consecutive championships, which is the most commendable.</p>
<p>This year, South China South has once again won the final qualification. It seems that the glorious record of four consecutive victories will be created today.</p>
<p>This time in the final, the opposing team is the Police Association. In terms of strength, South China is much stronger and victory is guaranteed. However, the police have enough "luck" to reach the final stage unexpectedly, and therefore are ambitious and determined to use their personnel to compete with South China for the championship.</p>
<p>They know that their skills are not as good as South China, so they have already decided to concentrate on practicing their strength, hoping to use this trick to defeat South China. However, South China also knows that "the old ones who come are not good" and is also prepared.</p>
<p>Since the police "combined Chinese and Western", their performance has been getting better day by day. This proves that those few Chinese generals have contributed a lot. However, Fan Guicai has recently suffered from eye disease and has not yet recovered. He may not play today. If he is absent, Mo Shi will be the center forward. This "bald general" has enough power in his feet. If he suddenly unleashes a fierce shot, the goalkeeper will be surprised.</p>
<p>In the previous league, the police were lucky to win against South China. This time, when they meet on a narrow road, they are here to settle the score. South China remembers the revenge of the previous defeat and will definitely take this opportunity to kill them and wash away their shame.</p>
<p>The police have been dreaming about this championship. After obtaining the final qualification, they practiced hard and urged Hou Lu, who went to Singapore for business, to return to Hong Kong to respond to this battle. It is said that the two veterans, Goff and Brooks, have also started practicing. Although they are not necessarily going to play, their ambition can be seen.</p>
<p>Hou Lu plays the inside forward, which is the same as playing the midfielder. He retreats well and moves slowly, so he is not a dangerous person. However, because of his height and long legs, he occasionally sprints and uses his head skills, which is quite scary. Therefore, South China's defenders must be careful of this.</p>
<p>Fan Zeicai is agile and good at sprinting, but center forward is not his forte and he lacks experience. Under the surveillance of the Mai and Liang defenders, he will have difficulty moving. On the contrary, if he is absent due to eye disease and Mo Shi is transferred to center forward, relying on his big body, a rush and a shot will be fiercer than Lao Fan.</p>
<p>In fact, the most worrying thing about the police's front line is still that fellow Hualiya. He is lively enough and has considerable skills in passing and dribbling. Therefore, South China's defenders must be careful of this person and not let him have any loopholes to exploit, which may lead to trouble.</p>
<p>I believe that the most important strategy for South China's defenders to deal with the police's attack is to avoid being held by force, to control the enemy with skill, and to resist their sprints, not losing in the header. If that is the case, their shooting skills are not good, and they will not break Bao Jiaping's "closed-door policy."</p>
<p>The three midfielders, Pa Jia, Bi Lie Dian, and Nuo Fu, have enough experience and are good at interception. Therefore, I advise South China's forwards not to use too many short passes in the midfield. Even with Feng Jingxiang's wisdom and Li Zhaorong's agility, they will definitely have a way to get past this line. To go a step further, the quickest way to win is to use the strategy of flanking attacks on both wings. If there are too many short passes, it will eventually be slow.</p>
<p>In the match between Xinghua and Hong Kong, I saw that Chen Guangyu's performance was still lacking. Deng Guangsen ran fast and Zhaorong was cunning enough. I believe that Lao Chen will be very busy today.</p>
<p>Luo Douwen must use swift attacks to break through Bi Liban's final defense. If he attacks roundaboutly, I am afraid it will be ineffective, because Lao Luo's control of the ball is not very reliable and he can easily be intercepted by the experienced Bi.</p>
<p>Guo Yingqi should always move forward to attack, and with Jingxiang's supply from the middle, there is no lack of opportunities.</p>
<p>In short, South China has a 90% chance of winning. Work hard, the glory of four consecutive championships depends on today's victory.</p>
<p>The strength of Tugger and Middleton in Group B is about the same. It is expected that the fierce battle will be no less than the Group A match. It is difficult to predict who will win the championship. The lineups of South China and the Police are recorded as follows (Football Field God)</p>

<h3>Xinghua Team Left Hong Kong Yesterday to Go to Manila for Another Charity Match</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Singapore Chinese Football Team, which came to Hong Kong aggressively, had two losses and one win, leaving a so-so impression.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the team went to Macau for sightseeing. Originally, they had no intention of challenging the Macau army. However, when the news came out, the Macau General Association said that it was an opportunity to learn from each other since the guests were here. Therefore, they strongly invited the visiting team to play a performance. Xinghua agreed to the request because of the hospitality. They fought fiercely. However, the Xinghua players were half tired and did not perform well. Although they took the lead with a score of 2 to 1, the Han Lian team counterattacked and the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. They used the advantage of a penalty kick to tie the score. In the last minute, they scored another goal and defeated Xinghua with a score of 3 to 2.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Xinghua team returned to Hong Kong and immediately packed their luggage to prepare to return south. At 3:30 in the afternoon, the entire team took the Star Ferry across the sea and boarded the "Gan De Zui Di" ship.</p>
<p>Those who came to see them off included Mo Qing, Lin Shaohua, Zhou Runnian, and Bao Jiaping, Liang Rongzhao, Zhu Zhaohang and others from the South China Association. In the first-class hall, everyone sat around the table. Team leader Deng Yuehan asked the waiter for drinks and had a big drink.</p>
<p>They talked and laughed, and enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot to return. When the whistle sounded, the people who came to see them off shook hands with the Xinghua players and said goodbye.</p>
<p>According to team leader Deng, "We will go to Manila again and play a charity match with the All-Philippines United team. The income will be used to help the refugees in Cheng. Our initial intention was to play against the Sha Shua College team again, because last time in Manila, we defeated Sha Shua. If we fight again, we can hope to wash away our shame. However, Manila telegraphed, saying that Lasha was unwilling to fight again and specified that they wanted to play against the United team. This is also fine. Besides, it is a charity event, so why should we begrudge the effort? After the match in Manila, we will return to Singapore on the original ship."</p>

<h3>Open Baseball Tournament Registration Deadline is the 14th</h3>
<p>This year's football season can be completely concluded within this month. What follows is the Hong Kong Open Baseball League. It is learned that the registration for this league has begun and will close on the 14th of this month. Those who wish to register can contact Liu Guozhang, the honorary secretary of the Baseball Association (Tian Wei Yang Da Nei).</p>
<h3>The Next Week's Tennis Schedule is Rich</h3>
<p>The next week's schedule for the open singles and doubles tennis tournament is extremely rich. Strong players will meet each other, and hard players will collide. It is bound to be a fierce battle. On Monday, the 11th, the pair Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi will fight with Gao Shanshu and Remidi. One is good at attacking and the other is good at defending. There will definitely be good shots. On Wednesday, the 12th, the defending doubles champions, the Xu brothers, will meet Lin Huang or Gao Lei on a narrow road. A fierce battle is expected. On Thursday, the 13th, the match between Xu Weipei and Lin Zhen can be said to be one of the most exciting scenes in this tennis tournament. Little Lin Zhen has performed extremely well this week, almost surpassing his brother. And Xu is the dictator of the singles and doubles on the hard court last year. If he can get past this hurdle, then the future is smooth. Therefore, both sides will do their best. On the 14th (Friday), Da Linzhen will play against Lin Tiande. Its importance is not as great as the battle between Xiao Linzhen and Da Xu. Lin is a good player in Nanyang. When he first came to Hong Kong, he repeatedly defeated famous players and won praise. However, what is the highest peak of his skills? It has not been revealed to the audience yet. This time, he is facing Da Linzhen. He often has stubborn methods to control the enemy. At the same time, Da Linzhen will definitely work hard to assassinate in order to preserve his reputation and break through the difficulties. A fierce battle is expected at that time. The entire schedule for the next week is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Xuhuai Cup Second Competition: South China's Ideal Lineup; Li Huitang Again Serves as Frontline Commander</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Although the Xuhuai Cup Football Tournament is limited to the participation of the South China, Army, and Navy teams, all three teams are powerful and have always competed fiercely.</p>
<p>In the first battle of this year, the Army was defeated by the Navy with a score of 1 to 2. The second battle will be held on the 10th of this month (Monday), with South China playing against the Army. If the Army loses again, they will have no hope for the championship.</p>
<p>As the war is approaching, the Army selected its personnel the day before yesterday to prepare to play against South China. However, the list is mostly composed of Group B players. What is even more surprising is that the midfield line does not include the three outstanding players from Middleton, but instead uses Group B players. This point is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>South China's generals have not yet been decided. According to Mo Qing's intention, the lineup is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Li Guowei Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai</p>
<p>Luo Douwen Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang He Guangsen</p>
<p>This ideal lineup will definitely be more than enough to deal with the Army. However, the competition is based on a 90-minute system, and the soldiers have enough stamina, so precautions must be taken.</p>
<p>Li Huitang has been appearing and exerting his strength in all charity matches this season. This competition is precisely of a charitable nature, so he is also listed.</p>
<p>Among the eleven players in the Army lineup, we only know the skills of Su Shu and Mei. The rest have often been seen. The lineup is recorded as follows: (Huan Yu)</p>
<p>Deng Qin</p>
<p>Fei Sha Shi Han</p>
<p>Mei Shi Su Shu Li Shi</p>
<p>Da Feilu Su Shi Ge Lu Ge Ni Yan Bachen</p>
<p>Reinforcements: Mo Shi Xian, Bo Shi, Jia Shi, Fa Lan Da Shi, Wei Jian Chen, Mai Dang Nuo Ling Shi</p>
<p>Tonight's Basketball Schedule</p>
<p>6:30 PM (Group B) Chuncao vs. Guangzhong</p>
<p>7:30 PM (Group A) Xiangdao vs. Peiying</p>
<p>8:30 PM (Group B) Peiying vs. Qingzhi</p>
<h3>South China's Expedition to Australia May Become a Reality Next Year; This Year the Jewish Team Took the Lead</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Last autumn, I heard that the South China Athletic Association had a motion to send a football team to revisit Australia. If this becomes a reality, the army can set off this summer, first conquering the South Seas, and then moving to Australia.</p>
<p>This news has been circulating for many months, and it is already summer. Is there any possibility that South China's motion will be realized, or will it end up as empty talk? As far as I know, this matter is currently stranded and I believe it will be difficult to achieve this year. However, there will be opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met Mr. Liu Guangfu, who returned to China from Australia not long ago. He is the "matchmaker" for South China's plan to revisit Australia. According to him, "The reason why South China could not go to Australia this year is not because of other obstacles, but because the motion was a bit late and was taken the lead by a purely Jewish football team, so South China could not go this year. It is said that it may become a reality next year."</p>
<p>This Mr. Liu has extensive social connections in Australia. Since he is willing to work hard to help South China make contact with former players, the matter may be successful. (Dong Lang)</p>

<h3>Significant Impact of the War on China's Fresh Egg Exports</h3>
<p>Chicken eggs are a major export product of our country, sold in large quantities to various regions. Before the war, an average of 9,759,000 eggs were shipped from Guangdong to Hong Kong each month, valued at 215,690 yuan in national currency; 1,640,000 to Macau, valued at 37,701 yuan; 3,600,000 to the Philippines, valued at 35,763 yuan; and 1,782,000 to Singapore, valued at 43,917 yuan. In addition, significant quantities were transported from Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo to Hong Kong, Singapore, and even Germany. However, since the outbreak of the war, after Chinese egg-producing cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai fell one after another, China's egg exports plummeted. The exports from Guangdong alone have decreased to 9,619,000 eggs (valued at 247,803 yuan). Compared to February 1937, which saw 33,324,000 eggs (valued at 1,269,842 yuan), the difference is significant. In February of this year, only 5,260,000 Guangdong eggs were shipped to Hong Kong (valued at 118,264 yuan). At that time, the Hong Kong egg market was experiencing a situation where demand exceeded supply. Fortunately, shipments arrived from Shantou, Shanwei, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon farms were also producing eggs, so the market did not experience a serious egg shortage.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Qingming Festival Amidst the Bright Spring Scenery</h3>
<p>— Cai Lusheng</p>
<p>A Silent Visit to Several Cemeteries and Burial Grounds</p>
<p>Time slips away like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, the "Qingming Festival," a tradition passed down for thousands of years, has arrived once again. "Do not stir up feelings of melancholy with black clothes, still in time to go home for Qingming," we recite the poems of our predecessors, reminding us of our own hometowns and the legacy of our ancestors. Everyone inevitably feels a longing to return home. However, among the many people who have been bombed out of their homes and have come to "safe havens" to "seek refuge," how many still have a "home" to return to?</p>
<p>The custom of sweeping tombs during Qingming is practiced throughout the country, and Hong Kong is no exception. During the holiday yesterday and today, the sun, which had been hidden behind the clouds for many days, surprisingly emerged, and under its radiant light, the weather changed from cold and gloomy to warm and bright, adding a lot of vibrant spring scenery to the land. On the narrow paths leading to several cemeteries, an endless stream of people, like endless chariots, came and went from early morning. Although the number of "buses" has been increased several times, they are still overcrowded, and each bus displays a "no more passengers" sign. Other "taxis" and private cars also came and went continuously. By noon, every cemetery was filled with thousands upon thousands of people sweeping tombs.</p>
<p>Here, to understand the "living" conditions of the countless compatriots who are sleeping in this foreign land and the grand occasion of the "Qingming Festival," I mingled among the tomb sweepers and paid a silent visit to several cemeteries and burial grounds. Amidst the tide of tomb sweepers, I visited: Xinhui, Taishan, Zengcheng, Dongguan, Chaozhou Bayi, Huizhou Shishu, Fujian Dakouhuan, Tung Wah Coffin Home, Ap Lei Chau, and several cemeteries and burial grounds. In front of each simple tomb, there was a variety of offerings, both large and small—sacrifices, cakes, rice, wine, roasted meat, chicken, duck, fish...things prepared for the "ghosts" to eat. And they burned large amounts of "money" for the "ghosts" to use—paper ingots, paper silver, "Banknotes of the Netherworld," as well as incense and firecrackers, creating swirling smoke and echoing sounds. What surprised us "outsiders" the most was the crying of a few women in front of the tombs—they seemed to be in great sorrow, wailing and lamenting. At first, it sounded quite sad, but upon closer listening, we realized that they were actually "singing"—"dry crying" without tears.</p>
<p>Near every cemetery, there were always a few seasonal businesses—selling incense and candles, offering wonton noodles, taking quick photos...many stalls of various sizes. In addition, because a cemetery contains tens of thousands of graves, tomb sweepers often cannot find the exact location of the tomb and need the cemetery caretakers to help them find it. Therefore, these caretakers were able to make a very profitable "business" that was almost pure profit. There were also some who were engaged in "costless business"—selling fresh flowers. When tomb sweepers placed fresh flowers on the tomb and left, they would pick them up again and sell them to the next person, circulating the business in this way, and they were also able to earn some "windfall profits."</p>
<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, the increase in Hong Kong's population has been directly proportional to the increase in graves. All burial grounds have become so overcrowded due to the increasing number of graves that there is no room for "coffins," and the method of "demolish the old to build the new" is being implemented—by notifying them to relocate. However, in one place called the Chinese Permanent Cemetery, burial can remain fixed there forever.</p>
<p>The entire construction of the permanent cemetery is extremely luxurious and magnificent, a stark contrast to the cramped and dilapidated burial grounds in other cemeteries. There, not only is there a spacious grand hall—where tomb sweepers bring wine and food to feast and drink, but there are also many delicately built pavilions, as well as exquisite tomb chambers attached to the graves. The location of these graves, it is said, has been carefully considered by feng shui masters. Therefore, on the finely carved tombstones, one can often see inscribed "feng shui" terms such as "facing direction ×, sitting direction ×," etc. I really cannot understand why there are still people who harbor such wishful thinking—relying on "feng shui" to scheme for some kind of "success and prosperity"? If the theory of "feng shui" were true, then the world would be in danger of the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer. What nonsense!</p>
<p>Looking back at our motherland, where the smoke of war is rising and the flames of battle are raging, how many soldiers are wrapped in horsehide and returned to their homes, and how many compatriots who have died resisting × are lying in ditches and ravines, are melting into the soil of our motherland, becoming the soil of the Republic of China—they are living on in death, they do not need "graves." Therefore, seeing these "wealthy" people here, busily building luxurious tombs for those who died a "righteous" death, one cannot help but feel that people have too much "leisure and elegance"!</p>

<h3>On the Truth of Art</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>The task of art is to reflect and express objective truth. The basis of the success of art, and the reason why it can attract a wide audience, lies in its ability to keenly and vividly reflect objective truth, transforming objective truth into artistic truth and presenting it to the broad masses in a clear and dynamic manner. Using artistic truth to incite the masses to cry and laugh, to stir up joy and anger, and allowing the masses to gain new stimulation and see all the truths of the past and present in art—these are the powers of art, and these are the tasks of art. The success or failure of a work of art depends on the depth, height, and breadth of the objective truth it reflects. Therefore, the most important condition for an artist in the creative process, and also the condition for their success, is to grasp objective truth and create artistic truth from objective truth.</p>
<p>The truth of art is not the same as the truth of reality. Some people often confuse the truth of reality with the truth of art, believing that the truth of reality is the truth of art, and that art only needs to replicate the truth of reality onto a work like a camera. But there is no such thing as "artistic truth." Some even believe that many "facts" in reality become "artistic truth" when reflected in art. These are all mistakes. The truth of art is different from the truth of reality. It is a truth that is more advanced, clearer, and more compelling than the truth of reality. Because it is based on an objective foundation, it purifies the truth of reality from its randomness. It has removed the unwarranted elements that breed in reality, and eliminated all accidental factors. It synthesizes and generalizes objective facts, thereby creating something new and more advanced. Therefore, the truth of art is comprehensive and complete. It already contains all aspects of objective reality, while the truth of reality is only one-sided and individual. It can only represent one side or one corner of the entire objective reality. The truth of art, because it has undergone artistic processing, has become something more advanced than the truth of reality.</p>
<p>The truth of art is the grasping of the comprehensive and entire process of objective reality, but at the same time, the scientific truth of grasping the comprehensive process of objective reality is not the same as the truth of art. Although both scientific truth and artistic truth seek to grasp the "truth" of the objective and express the "truth" of the objective by purifying the randomness of the objective, the truth of art is the unity of objective truth and image, while scientific truth is a fusion of objective truth and abstract concepts. In other words, art grasps "truth" from the form of sensory entity and expresses "truth" from vivid images, while science grasps "truth" from the logical and general form and expresses "truth" with abstract concepts and laws. This is the significant difference between the two, and the distinguishing line between art and science, clearly differentiating artistic truth from scientific truth. Artistic truth, due to its inherently specific nature, must be the unity of objective truth and image.</p>
<p>Objective reality is developing, and the truth of art, as a reflection of objective reality, must naturally also be developing. As Lunacharsky once said: "He who does not recognize development will never see the truth—because the truth does not resemble its original state, does not stop moving forward, but leaps forward; the truth is progressing, the truth is contradictory, the truth is struggling, the truth—it is of tomorrow, and it must be recognized as such." These words clearly point out the tomorrow-ness, future-ness, and developmental-ness of truth. The truth in art must include this future-ness and tomorrow-ness in order to grasp development and grasp truth. An excellent artistic creation not only needs to reflect the reality of its time, but also needs to reflect the future development of this reality, using the brilliance of tomorrow and the future to guide the practical path of the masses. This is to create the truth of art.</p>
<p>The truth of art is creation, and it is the basic task of human art. However, when reality undergoes drastic changes, such as the great national revolutionary struggle that is currently taking place in our motherland, if an artist wants to speak of the truth of reality and create the truth of art, they must throw themselves into that great upheaval. Because only from our own life practice can we experience all the changes in reality, can we more intimately feel all the transformations, and can we, in the wilderness of reality, discover the truth of reality, grasp the truth of reality, and thereby create the truth of reality!</p>
<h3>A Place to Stand</h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>A person born into this world, according to common sense, should always have a place to stand. However, there are people who are crying out that they don't even have a place to stand. What is the reason for this? Clever people say that such people have reached this point because they are too stupid. Besides, heaven and earth are inherently vast, how could such a thing happen?</p>
<p>The way of the world for clever people is indeed wonderfully indescribable. In short, the first step is to blow, to blow with their mouths. Their mouths are better than the dragon's mouth that blows breath into clouds. With a blow, they can cause heaven and earth to change color. If they apply it in a small way, stirring it into a breeze, they can make the people around them scatter in the wind, giving them space to move around. Isn't the use of blowing great?</p>
<p>The second step is to pat, to pat with their hands. They know that blowing is for dealing with people on the same level as them, but for people above them, blowing is sometimes ineffective. If they only blow, they cannot stop them from pressing down. This requires the use of patting, patting upwards. Fortunately, the people above all enjoy this flattery. As long as you pat, they will rise lightly like a rubber ball or a balloon, leaving ample space above you for you to stand out.</p>
<p>Ordinary clever people, having mastered the arts of blowing and patting, will find themselves in a comfortable position and can enjoy themselves without seeking other skills and stopping there. However, there are also some kind-hearted clever people who want to take it a step further to expand their space. This further third step is to use stepping, to step with their feet.</p>
<p>The wonderful use of stepping seems to surpass blowing and patting. Those who are particular about establishing themselves in the world should not be unaware of this. Stepping means placing other people under one's feet. Suppose the area around you has already been cleared by blowing, and the space above you has already been loosened by patting, now if you step on something under your feet, you can stand tall and be the only one to be respected. Even further, if you are indeed busy and have not yet mastered blowing and patting, then as long as you know how to step, and step forcefully, the more you step under your feet, the higher you can rise, like a tree that has just been rained on, towering above the loft. At that time, those who look up to you from below will certainly be unable to catch up, and those above you, if they cooperate with you, you will naturally rise higher and higher. Otherwise, sooner or later they will be pushed down by you, and you can "take their place."</p>
<p>Why are these clever people with good skills also kind-hearted? There is no other reason; it would be a waste of resources not to make use of it, which is a bit of a pity. So they have great compassion and use everything as a stepping stone, turning rottenness into magic, enabling them to do their best and get what they deserve. They have simply done a great good deed, so they are called kind-hearted.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are many clever people, but kind-hearted clever people are even more numerous. So everyone is a great philanthropist. And those who are completely stupid are of course still there, it is impossible not to have them, but there are very few. They have no place to stand, which is what they deserve. Who told them not to understand the three movements of blowing, patting, and stepping?</p>
<p>Stupid people are simply the leftovers and waste of the world. Wouldn't the world be even more spacious without them, allowing clever people to run rampant? In all fairness, clever people should not give these stupid people a place to stand, much less a place to stand. Some clever people are still willing to give them a space under their feet so that they can settle down. Aren't these clever people kind-hearted!</p>
<p>It is very good that clever people say that the earth is very vast. Isn't it because they themselves have a place to stand and even stupid people have a place to stand because of them! Amitabha, clever people are both clever and kind, how rare, how rare!</p>
<h3>Japan's Stance During the War</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>It has been twenty-one months since the Japanese army lit the flames of aggression at the Lugou Bridge. When the war first started, the Japanese military expected to "win quickly" and "succeed immediately," using "small forces" to seize "large benefits." They believed that with their new-style weapons such as airplanes, artillery, and tanks, coupled with planned political conspiracies, it would not be difficult to make our country "kneel." But as our army continued to fight strongly, the "quick victory" has become a pipe dream. This was of course beyond the expectations of the warmongers.</p>
<p>So, what is Japan's stance during the war actually showing? Please see the following news, although they are all "trivial" social dynamics, seemingly "unimportant," but using the "small" to illustrate the "big," it is not difficult to imagine the results obtained by the aggressors from here.</p>
<p>Professor Famine</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, recently, in universities across the country, many professors and assistant teachers have been arrested for participating in people's front groups or being suspected of anti-war thoughts, and have been suspended or arrested. As a result, universities are feeling the pinch of a professor shortage. The Minister of Education, Araki, is having a difficult time coping with this. Currently, six universities, including Tokyo Imperial University, have a total shortage of 169 professors and 162 assistant teachers. This is truly an unprecedented phenomenon in the Japanese education world.</p>
<p>Unable to Marry. Japanese women have not yet escaped the shackles of feudal society. "Good wife, wise mother" is their highest moral indicator. Most women take "marriage" as a shortcut to solve their lives. However, recently, due to the prolonged and unresolved war against China, young men have been conscripted to the front lines in China, and the number of casualties is so high that it has invisibly deprived many Japanese girls of their husbands, making it impossible for girls who have reached marriageable age to find a marriage partner. According to a recent survey by the Tokyo City Social Affairs Bureau, there are 200,000 such young women in Tokyo alone. These young women, unable to marry, have to wander around looking for jobs, but where are there so many ready-made positions to place these unmarried women?</p>
<p>Horse-Drawn Carriages Reappear. Gasoline is an important fuel during wartime, and resource-poor Japan naturally regards it as a treasure and is unwilling to waste even a drop of it. Therefore, the number of cars appearing in Tokyo recently is very small, and most of them use charcoal as a substitute. And the horse-drawn carriages, which had disappeared from Tokyo for decades, have reappeared, used to replace cars and trucks, as if returning to the early Meiji era. If the war does not stop, horse-drawn carriages will inevitably flood Japan.</p>
<p>Cutting off Collars and Sleeves. The result of the shortage of textiles will bring about a change in Japanese clothing. Soon, the new clothes for Japanese women must be shortened uniformly. This is a government order. In the future, Japanese girls will wear fashionable clothes without "collars" and "sleeves." Their underwear will be cut short to a shocking degree. This "unique" dress is a special embellishment on the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p>Decreasing Infant Population. In the Japanese House of Representatives, Ito Iwao, a member of the Seiyukai, asked Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose about the declining birth rate in Japan, expressing concern and asking the government to explain its countermeasures. According to Hirose's reply, in this war of aggression, the birth rate of children has indeed decreased "considerably." The normal "annual production of nearly two million" has probably decreased by 300,000 to 400,000. This is still the so-called official report. The actual number is certainly more than this. Moreover, due to the difficult lives of the people, the mortality rate of infants and young children is also higher than usual. This is a serious social problem.</p>
<p>"The happy, flower-like Japan has disappeared, and a shadow of sadness covers every inch of land, with drops of melancholy tears falling on everyone's heart!" These words of Sano Keisaku are an accurate description.</p>
<h3>Tomb</h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>Everyone has such a day...</p>
<p>Carrying traces of disillusionment</p>
<p>Entering the final palace of life.</p>
<p>At that time, what is left behind</p>
<p>Is only the memories shining in the hearts of descendants,</p>
<p>And the sins and glories imprinted on the tombstone.</p>
<p>You must remember:</p>
<p>After Yue Fei's death,</p>
<p>People built temples for him,</p>
<p>And reverently worship him every year and every season.</p>
<p>You must remember,</p>
<p>Although Qin Hui has turned to dust,</p>
<p>But people have made a kneeling statue of him,</p>
<p>Striking his head fiercely every day,</p>
<p>Punishing his wickedness in life!</p>
<p>You bandits of the nation,</p>
<p>Why not deeply, deeply repent</p>
<p>Before you enter your graves?</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Go, frozen ghosts have no warm graves!" Then, he secretly said again: "I can spare you from becoming a frozen ghost, but I can't stop them from arresting you and making you a criminal!"</p>
<p>So, he felt a terror that was even more threatening than the cold. He calmly looked around, but his vision was blurred by the dim night after only a few feet. He listened again, as if he heard the sound of shoes grinding against the snowy road, gradually getting closer. As he stared into the distance, he did not see any differently colored figures on the white road, but the sound was still ringing, getting closer, right beside him. A few dead leaves were stirred by the wind, rubbing against each other and swirling on the snowy road. To reassure himself, he crushed those dead leaves that were nearing their end. Soon, there was a new sound coming from afar. He listened quietly, and he believed it was the sound of a patrolling police chief—the sound of the leather sheath of his saber rubbing against the leather leggings tied to his legs as he walked. He became anxious and finally began to ask her again:</p>
<p>"Can't you come with me?"</p>
<p>"Ask yourself!" she snorted. "I've already told you!"</p>
<p>"I can't let you go either, so are you just going to stand here?"</p>
<p>"I'd rather stand here!"</p>
<p>"Here, do you think a police chief will pass by?"</p>
<p>"What are you so nervous about?"</p>
<p>"It's not 'nervous,' it's a police chief. A police chief, that is, a detective. Do you want to wait for a detective to come and inform on me?"</p>
<p>"No! Why would I want to make others suffer? I don't want others to be unlucky because of me. But, I can't let others harm me either. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, when you leave, you'll be alone!"</p>
<p>At this time, there was no sound to be heard, far or near. What was bothering him was only the wind and snow around him—sometimes pulling at his clothes with force, sometimes stimulating his face with cold. But this was natural for someone who was born in the frigid zone, accustomed to living in the frigid zone. Especially him—a sufferer of cold, who looked forward to winter every year, like a polar bear, finding joy in frolicking in the wind and snow every year. However, this time he felt annoyed by the wind and snow. Because this wind and snow not only did not give him the joy of previous years, but also made him uneasy. He had to constantly shield his ears with his hands or brush away the snow in front of his eyes, not letting the wind and snow disturb or blur his hearing and vision. He was doing all this to watch her. He was worried that in a moment of inattentiveness, she would disregard everything and escape. Although he believed that he still had the strength to restrain her, making it difficult for her to escape, he was afraid that the escape would lead to even more unexpected ruptures and failures.
