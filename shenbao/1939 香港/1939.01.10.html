<p>【路透社倫敦九日電】本社記者訪某當局、據稱、英國擬卽對日實施壓力、使其尊軍中國門戶開放之說、不可相信、過去英國曾考盧如何保護在華之利益、尤以揚子江航行爲最重要、雖然、英美同能表示同一之趨勢、但因全部許多問題之複雜性、故政府對于每一步　未實施前、必須加以詳細之考慮</p>
<h3>希特勒手下的匈牙利</h3>
<p>匈牙利的老政治家愛克哈爾特博士、是前貝斯蘭內閣時代的農黨首領、他是匈牙利國內反法西反希特勒最激烈的份子、他曾說過、『匈牙利在國社黨活動陰謀之下、將被國社黨化而遭遇一五二六年亡國的覆轍、司時他又發言警告國內的國社黨說、『匈牙利人民决不做國社主義糟下的犧牲者』、不過匈牙利國內的國社運動、非特不因此而匿跡、反而與波助浪、在國內大事煽動着、尤可令人注意的、就是在今年四月匈牙利國內的阿爾伯德地方竟有將被希特勒佔領的俾說、</p>
<p>現在匈牙利的內閣總理音賴特、是個鎭行家、同時又是個老練的東事家、因參加戰爭有功、曾得到過許多動章、他認爲匈牙利的貧弱不振、很容易受到外强的掠奪、同時他更認爲國內國社黨所以敢明目張胆的活動、也是由於國勢不强所致、因此他一上台就頒佈五項改造新計劃、對內發展國家財政、謀積極開設國營工廠、訓練勞動工人、保陣農工生活安定、使國內失業工人得以减？、勞動者生活得以改良、對外則謀擴充軍備、以增强國威、雖然他的外交政策仍與德國友好合作、可是他對德國的態度、比前幾任內閣要强硬得多、他决不願自己的國家法西期化、因此對國內的國止運動、也是出極嚴厲的辦法、加以製裁及阻止、</p>
<p>今年八月小協約國在南斯拉夫所舉行的會機上、允許匈牙利擴充軍備、這一點不可不算是音賴特總理上台後的勝利收穫、小協約國之所以改變從前反對匈牙利修約的態度、固然是因爲他們見到柏林、羅馬軸心新近在歐洲的勢力日見增加、小協約集團本身的地位自顧小暇、沒有力量再去與匈牙利爲難、但是在另一方面說、也未警不是匈牙利所派均代表向小協約集團積極疏通的結果、</p>
<p>不過我們要知道、匈牙利當局决不因此而自足固然、在這火藥氣息充滿歐洲的今日、　備可以防禦外强的侵略、在匈牙利的反法北斯派如愛克哈爾特之流、多認爲單靠軍備是不足挽救國家的危機、因爲在匈牙利的邊境地帶、有着許多縣田可耕的貧農、他們多住在半封建式的窮鄕僻地、過着貧苦生活、國社黨曾利用這個弱點、從中挑撥、煽動農農起來反抗政府、故在這些貧是中、最邊已有有幾千人參加國社運動、愛克哈爾特博士看穿了這個弱點、他認爲是威家心情之患、政積極從事策劃、建職政府從速開發邊區、使農民得前安居樂業、使成社份子在該處的陰謀無法下手、結果匈牙利國會就通過愛克哈蘭特博士的建議、頒佈邊區士地改良法、到九月四日音領特曾在卡波斯伐爾地方、對土地改良法的施行計劃、發表重要　說、表示該計劃限七年內完成、每年平均可以墾殖出十萬英畝良出、供給貧農耕種、此外幷表示政府願借欵給農民、作爲耕權資金、由於這槿土地改良法的成立、我們就可想像出、反法西斯派在匈牙利國內已有絕大勢力、愛克哈爾特博士也繼之發表談話稱、「現在匈牙利的內政已逐漸革新、向前邁推、雖然有許多政策在實施上常遭到反動份子的陰謀破壞、而發生陰碍、但我們决不因此而灰心、札信在不久將來、國內總會有比現在更自由、更革新的政治、經濟及外交制度產生」。</p>
<p>這個土地改良法的實現、十足表現出匈牙利的政府巳逐漸轉入反法西派、同時這個計劃、完全是針對着匈牙利國內國社黨徒而發、自然、匈牙利國內的法西匪徒、决不願意它很順利的發展下去、他們也在策劃各種陰謀毒計、對這憫計劃加以阻止及破壞、據我最近得到的情報、知道希特動手下的一般小　和走狗們、巳在邊區一帶從事遊說、以允許立刻分　良田予節農爲餌、　動他們反對政府、而參加　們的威社組織、柴賴蘇少校、是匈境內國社組織重要　領之一、新近因參加該項活動、巳被政府論捕、判處三年徒刑、但這種陰謀决不因此而中止、其他法西斯領袖、仍在繼續活動員、現在匈境邊區的斯德封縣、已被國社黨活勒得完全法西化、一切政治、輕濟也完全被國社黨操縱、匈牙利當局能　從速實行這個土地改良、去擊破破社黨的陰謀呢、我對這鄉題很爲匈牙利担愁、</p>
<p>自明異會議把捷克事件解决　、德匈間的外交、也改變了以前的親善態度、在明興會議尚未舉行之前、匈牙利是一向巴結德國而做希特勒的帮兇、她想趨火打刦、分割樓克領土、故當局曾數次訪問德國、希特勒都表示贊助收回隨境內的失刊、可是到明與會　後、　克反與德國振手曾歡、要求希特勒帮助肆克反抗匈牙利、同時德國對於匈牙和之要求割讓處森尼亞、以與波蘭領上連接一點、竟加以反對、選使匈牙利對德國的態縣、不得不因區轉駝、而改變其一貫親德政策、在過去匈牙利是主張波匈聯合、共同防御聯、但到親在、她却反高呼組織波匈軸心來阻止希特勒樓取羅馬尼亞的油田、與烏克蘭的農產了、</p>
<p>希特勒之所以不贊成以擔克的盧森　亞劃議給匈牙利的原因、一方面固然由於對他摟取烏克蘭的野心有所陰碭、但其最大的原因、却是因爲他對盧森尼亞也有侵略企圖、我們知道、在希森尼亞省內居有一白萬波蘭及蘇聯少數民族、希特勒可在該處佈置戰社勢力、再連用各種陰謀、使這般人投到息己的抱懷襄來、作爲成社黨在這一帶區域活動的根據地、使他侵略大烏克蘭的野心易於　現、假如盧森尼亞被匈牙利佔區、則希特勒的侵略計劃、就成空中樓閣、可望面不可得了、雖然盧森尼亞是多高山的下毛盆能、文化亦不先進、但在希特勒的以侵略爲出發點的眼光看來、盧森尼亞却是軍事方面股險要的區域、今年十一月二日、德意兩國外長把擾匈兩國糾紛仲裁判决後、匈牙利雖然從掩克方面得到兩個益要市鎭、可是爲森尼亞始終沒有歸還匈牙利、希特勒的野心、也就於此可鑒、</p>
<p>現在希特勒的黨徒們在匈牙利國內更形活關、國內若干民衆巳深染國社黨的奉素、阿拍德（Arpd）的日爾曼民族、也在a激發種族情緒、起來暴動、要求麟囘祖國、總之、希特勒安圖東進的今日、匈牙利這個障礙物、他是諰爲必須除去的、因亂它是進攻烏克蘭及蘇聯的交通孔道之一、同時匈牙利的農產品及牲洛、也被希特勒者中、不過有一點不要忽視、匈牙利的反法西派、在愛克哈爾特博士領導之下、也在大事活動、他們早巳同悉法西斯派的隊課毒計、故已有充份學備、顯爲國家誼門到底、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>菲律賓僑胞的榮譽</h3>
<p>今天港聞版有一條值得注意的消息，據菲律賓確訊，自全面抗戰開展以來，我菲律賓僑胞援助祖國抗戰的捐欵，到現在爲止，已經超過一千萬九，平均起來，每一個菲律賓僑胞，都已爲祖國爭取獨立自由幸幅的抗戰而捐助出一百多元。這個數字雖不算　得驚人，但是以本港過去成績比較起來，却不能不使人發生「後勝於此多多矣』的感想，若再一考究兩地胞僑的生活狀况，則尤不能不使人發生異樣的感覺。</p>
<p>本港僑胞，尤其是中產小產階層的僑胞，及所謂『勞動大衆』如小販等等，過去對於祖國出錢出力，其熱烈忠實，眞是令人見而感泣，但無庸諱言的，尚有許多僑胞，未能經常地熱烈地爲國捐輸，我們布望大家看看菲島僑胞今日的榮譽，興奮起來，展開光榮的競賽，對於抗戰建國的提前實現，一定有非常巨大的實效，現在各界對於一元還債運動的熱烈，也許可以不敢再使中外人士失望吧！</p>
<h3>停止×軍的進攻！</h3>
<p>歐洲大戰德軍進攻凡爾登的時候，法國軍隊中自然流行一句口號，『不許放他過來』！一時成爲戰爭中的號令一般，萬衆一心，終於殺敗德軍。</p>
<p>『停止×人的進攻！』這是目前階發我們抗戰的緊急任務！也可用作流行於我們全民族中的一個號令。</p>
<p>據士幾西報說：『自中日開戰後，近日實臻』最驚奇的階段。除　軍灣擊隊向成立之日軍作小接輪外，日軍顯然已完全停止進攻。南昌長沙兩要鎭，初曾認爲廿七年杪之前必陷入日軍之手，低迄至今日，此兩要鎭之安穩，猶爲武漢淪陷前之情境也』。這裏可以看出『×軍困難日趨嚴重，我軍愈戰急强』這句話，絕對不只是一部份人的樂觀見解，而是必然的事實。</p>
<p>當然，如果認定目地戰爭的普遍沉寂，就說×軍已無進攻力量，顯然是一種錯誤，因為×軍事實上還有悉索敝賦孤注一擲的可能；不通，很如我們前綫的戰臨力能够日益加強，×後的戰團日益發展，後方反攻的準備積極完成，全國的政治加速進步，與人民加緊輸發輸力需助前綫，則不僅戰局可以繼續定下去，而目×軍亦將始終不能發動或推進其『最後的進攻』，直到我們最後婁逐日×出中國爲止，</p>
<p>情勢正在一天天於我有利，大家要加培興當，加倍努力，不惜一切犧牲，來實說『停止×軍的遣政！』</p>

<h3>近衛內閣瓦解與　平沼內閣的展望　（續昨第七版）</h3>
<p>— 李萬居</p>
<p>新內閣的展望</p>
<p>平沼麒一郎爲法西斯運動的領袖之一，此次出任首相，他的作風固與近衛無甚差別，但是他的蠻幹必定還要『百尺竿頭，更進一步。』未來的舉措頗值得我們的注意。</p>
<p>一·國民冉組織邇動。日本雖是個讀武好戰的民俟，但這次對我國的侵略戰，它的國民凡是頭腦較爲淸醒的都知道帥出無名，加以戰。爆發後其所動員的大量異額除選回的死灰之外，均是有去無返，國民遂由善悶而陷於悲觀，精神日益不振，使日本黨政者驚惶不知所措，而氣焰不世此軍閥全此也機到束手無策了。去年五月下旬近衛內閣改組，荒木上合之後，卽加緊推進所謂「團民再租織」運動，以冀振作其國民的頹廢精神。現在國民冉組繳運動的三巨頭之一的木戶旣就內相之職，精神運動舊事重提。積極世動。白屬意中事，至於內容也將有重大變更，惟變化到某種程度，此時尚戰逆料。</p>
<p>二·戰費無限制的支出。一年半的戰爭，日本消耗之觀，不特日本人自己沒有夢想到，而且也出乎世界人士的意料之外，自七七至去年底止，除它愛年所僑備的軍火大部份消耗外，僅戰費一項卽連八十四萬萬元，中日戰事旣無法做到依照日軍閱所夢想的「速戰速决」，就目前的情勢而觀，戰事延長至何時結束，誰也不敢而且也不能斷定。戰事旣延長，戰費自然　非源源支出不可，但是如何籌措，頗成問題。發行鉅額的公債嗎？就過去的經騐看來，日本的胃腸並不健全，消化力有限得很；對外借款嗎？一年多的戰爭過程中，日軍在中國的懷炸殘殺，排斥外人事業，限制外人的行動，企圖獨勒東亞，已爲全世界的善良人士所痛心族首，近來英吳與論乃至政界方面其態度巳漸轉變强硬，大舉外價。巳感一此路不通』，實無疑問；處於山窮水盡的日本軍閥必逼迫其政府把全國總動員法付衛實施，以供業費的無限制支出，若察則企業家的投資，一班財閥必威裏足不前，戰濟界糨果必屬陷於美總不搌的地步。</p>
<p>三，內政與外交，平沼旣爲法西期領袖，平素主張革新運動最力，二·二六事變之後，他一躣而爲樞密院議畏，乃以重臣的地位關係，一切行動自然非愼重不可。鋒芒稍斂一時，惟腫的初衷並未改變，今旣身任首相，所謂「庶政革新」。勢在必行，其推行的結果，不特德內政無法潑淸，而且曾使之使加混亂，發展如何，不久卽可呈現於我們的眼前。不過未次及其他軍閥雖力主解散國會，平沼爲愼重計，諒可暫時設法避免，在外交方面，反英反蘇本爲日本法西斯主義者的一貫政策，媚美呢，因美國的政策日趨强硬，本月四日　期福總統在第七十六屆議與攻擊獨裁國家，措詞　常激烈，甚至主張民主國家應該聯合起來，給與侵略者以嚴厲制裁，所以對美外交政策似巳跑到絕境，至於對德意外交必更加積極，本月五日駐意日大使白鳥敏夫與駐德大使大島在意人利桑利摩城進行重要談話，並將與其駐歐洲各國外交人昌會談，由此即可知平沼上台後的日本，無論如何掩飾法西斯化，今後更將與其奧味相投的德意謀義密切的關係，如强反共節定，推動德意日三國，略的軍事同盟，這是可斷，的。　（釆完）</p>
<h3>一個建議　桂林山洞教育</h3>
<p>— 陶行知</p>
<p>（一）根據幾件事實</p>
<p>甲，桂林山洞天下，這些山洞不但是天然壕，而且是天然的民衆校舍。</p>
<p>乙，十一月三十日空襲警報一發，老百姓都到這些山洞裏去避空襲。我所到的地方叫做稚山岩，老百姓是人山人海的集中在三個比較大的洞裏，聽人說像這樣的地方，在桂林有百數以上，不知是否正確。自從幾次大轟炸以後，人民進洞躱避的自必愈加踴躍。</p>
<p>丙，我們在何事等到緊急警報來時，足足有半個熾頭，大家邵無事做，轟炸後，飛機去了，又等了許久時候，才解賒警報。在這時間內，老百姓也無辜做。</p>
<p>丁，我早晨是在國際反侵略運動中國分會演謂，中途得警報，只好陪同會中執事到稚岩，繼綫演講，老百姓也感覺興趣，臨時陶便聽。</p>
<p>戊，出發到稚山岩去，在一路所見，有應注意的幾件　似宜用教育來幫助解决：（一）走路很沒有秩序；（二）婦人家抱一個小孩，攜一個小孩的很多，沒有人幫忙；在狹路及洞口所見，小孩有被擠倒及踐壞之危險。</p>
<p>己，沒有空襲警報的時候，老百姓也到山洞裏去躱避，一直到兩三點鐘才囘家，不過人數少些。</p>
<p>庚，桂林本地及外省來的知識份子估計有一萬人，可以動員一二千人從事普及教育，以為老百姓服從，受傷醫好了的官兵，可以選拔英勇優秀者演講抗戰故事。</p>
<p>（二）提出幾條辦法</p>
<p>甲，每一個大山洞爲一戰時民衆學校，其包含之每一小山洞寫一課室，山飼內外應有教育　難之佈置及處理。</p>
<p>乙。組織桂林戰時普及教育團</p>
<p>一，依據山洞數，組織教育團，旬一個大山洞應有一個普及教育團負責。</p>

<h3>新形勢下的五中全會</h3>
<p>國民黨第五屆中央全體會議，現已定期於月內開會。當此民族抗戰進入嶄新階段，內外情勢煥然一新之際，這次全會，對於中華民族前途，對於世界和平前途，都有非常重大的意義，都會發生非常重大的影響，不能不加以烈熱的擁護與重大的注視。</p>
<p>國民黨是今日領導中華民族抗戰建國的最大的政黨，也是領導着全世界六分之一的人口的國家爲獨立自由幸福而鬥爭的政黨。這個政黨具有光榮偉大的革命歷史，自從全面抗戰展開以後，它在全國民衆和國際人士中的威信，更在逐日增加之中。然而無庸諱言，這個政黨的前途還存在不少障碍，汪兆銘的叛變，×人漢好的離間分化，算可是缺點與障礙的反映，爲了中華民族解放和世界和平前途，我們必須力謀國民黨的更團結，更健全，更進步，更革命化。這次五中全會的第一個任務，也就是要達到這個目的而已。特別是從汪兆銘叛變以後，一方面是在國民黨面前展開了更團結更健全更進步更革命的前途，另一方面則遇到了民族×人，漢奸×探以及黨內敗類的肆意離間毀謗破壞；因此我們希望五中全會特別注意及此，粉碎×奸的陰謀，健全黨的組織與振肅黨的紀律，力爭光明的前途。現居國外的中委，希望他們儘可能的趕囘重慶踴躍參加全會，而平日和汪氏接近的中委，則更應乘此機會，對黨盡其忠誠，明白表示擁護中央，反對分裂，以正中外視聽，而破×奸毒計！</p>
<p>中華民族爭取勝利的主要條件，就是全民族的團結一致，也就是抗日統一戰線的鞏固與擴展。抗戰十八個月以來國民黨威信的所以提高，也在於黨的領袖善於團結各黨各派及無黨派的民衆，執行民族統一戰線政策。然而×人漢奸民族敗類則千方百計，思所以離間之破壞之而後快，過去如此，今後亦莫不然。我們欽佩國民黨領袖過去能在艱險之中克服一切阻難，但爲澈底防止與淸掃前途阻難計，今日卽應確定業固及發展全國長期團結的辦法，樹立抗戰建國的民族聯盟，使各黨各派各族各界長期團結在國民黨統一領導之下，共同爲完成抗戰建國的神聖任務而奮鬥。電訊傳來，此次五中全會將對去年中共六中全會所提建立長期合作辦法愼重考慮付諸實施，這是值得全國民衆歡欣的消息，因爲這種考慮可以永遠粉碎×奸挑撥離間的陰謀，而開拓中華民族光明勝利的前途。</p>
<p>政治制度的進步與政治機構的改善，是保證抗戰必勝建國必成的基本條件，這是全面抗戰開展以來舉國一致的輿論，也是我中央政府所日夕謀求實現的國策。然而過去或因地域關係，或因人事關係，以致中央盡善盡美的政策與法令，而恰獲得絕對相反的結果，此種現象，平時已足妨礙中央政令的推行，妨礙政呀與人民的互相信精誠賴合作，而在抗戰建國時期，其影響更不堪設想！最近軍委會政治部長發表「關於政治部今後工作之討論與决議」一文，說明政治部根據一年半以來抗戰中血的經騐與教訓，對新階段政治工作作非常進步的决議，其中卽特別指出「政治重於軍事」，這是例證之一；而如何積極的扶植及發展民意機關，推進戰時民主政治，實行必要的民生改善，以至消極的肅淸貪汙土劣，改革保甲制度等等，都是加緊集中全民力量推進抗戰建國工作，到勝利之途的先决條件，亦當作爲此次全會的主要議題。</p>
<p>目前抗戰，已由消耗×軍的戰略防禦時期，進入全面游擊反攻的戰略第二期。這個時期的主要任務，是如何的制止×軍的進攻，是如何廣大地發動及完成反攻備準的新生力量，以便順利地進入戰略的第三期，達到驅逐日×出中國和建立獨立自由幸福新中國的目的。爲了忠實執行與完成這个時期的重大任務，我們必須加倍努力於前綫各部隊戰鬭力的增强，加倍努力於戰區及×軍後方戰鬭的增强與發展，加倍努力於淪陷地區抗日民主政權的建立，鞏固及擴大，加倍努力於後方軍事工業交通建設生產事業的更廣大更猛烈的發展：這些要求，有的已在實施，有的正在計劃，但爲迅速切實普遍的實現計，這次五中全會自當進一步確定具體的辦法。</p>
<p>此外如新的財政經濟政策的實施，抗戰的全面教育的普遍實施，三民主義靑年團的更廣泛大量地吸收全國靑年，健全組織發展工作，民衆動員機構的統一與改善，以至外交政策的改進與其機構的調整充實，在目前新形勢下，亦必須用突擊方法力謀實現。關於這些問題，我們已在今年元旦献詞」中詳陳所見，謹敢再行提出，向五中全會爲芹芻之献，希望中委諸公引爲參玫資料。</p>

<h3>在雲南訓練中之專門人材　是建國的一支牛力軍</h3>
<p>【本報昆明通訊】在不久的將來、筆南將成為中國的大學區、現在、在雲南的大事有最近改爲國立的雲南大學、由淸華、北京、南開組成的西南聯合大學、這些大學現在採用的課程還是戰前的、許多人要求採用非常時期教育、要求廢除戰前的制度、但是一些專家們却要保持從前的制　、只增加或改變一些課　、他們的理由是、要抗戰同時要建國、所以現在的大學教育的責任是要一方面培養目前適應需要的人材、同時還要不斷的產生將來建國的份子、　爲要抗戰並不是空就行、我們得有桂當的舉問盒出來、我們得有茶情、技能來應付我們的責任、對於一個受完高中教育的靑年、國家不止希望他能盡一個『兵』所應盡的力、他　史貢献多一點力量給國家、所以國家希望一部份靑年動員到前線去、一部份留在後方求取智識、然將他所得的還給國家、這是論戰的一個結論、</p>
<p>據現在看來、這種主張確也有他的好處、好像現在與建的　緬鐵路、叙昆鐵路、這是抗戰而又是建國的一種工作、而這兩條鐵路所需要的人材全是由一九三八年畢業的大學生中供給、貴州廣西的埋頭建設也是以這班靑年爲骨幹、他們每月只有四五十斤的報酬、而他們的工作却是繁重而籌專門訓練的、假如、大學教育廢除了、我們如何能不戰的灌輸這此基本的以至專門的智織於這班建議幹部呢、還有一件事值得報告的就是淸華大學在重慶設立的無線電研究所、他是每年由昆明聯大派出淸華電機系的畢業生到那邊去工作而直接受昆明的聯大中的淸華教授指揮、現在全國軍隊中用的無線電些空管、都是由這研究所供給、而這些眞空管裏、每一個釘一條銅絲都是由這班年靑的大學生、用手工做出來的、他們靠他們一些經驗用手來代替　器、雖然他們所做的出品、不比舶來品便宜、但是至少我們可以省了許多外匯、不用向外國去買！</p>
<p>這裏的西南聯合大學現正在想法使學生們獲得抗戰中的特殊技能、而又同時有基本的訓練、但比他們的電機工程系四年級生、除了必修無綫原理外、還要談實用無線管、這包括電碼收發機的製成、而注重的是訓練手工、原理大可不理、這樣當他讀完這課程時他們將會製造架設三四百里的通訊　、他們自己更要兼收發員、而他們還可以將這種手工傳給一個中　靑年使他們也有這種技　、即是說在一個游擊支隊、或任何一個小部隊有了一位曾受過這種訓練的人、他們就可以和其他的地方通訊自如了、但我們知道一架三四百里的通訊機、　由一個人甲手工製成、但一架和歐美諸國通訊的無線電機、就非一個人的能力所能架設管理、他歸要更專門的智識、單就電機工程也還不够、他還要天文學家、機械工程師來帮忙、所、非常時期的速成訓練、决不能代替了科學的基本訓練、這是現在昆明的所能見到的大學教育的原則、在不久以後、浙江同濟大學中正錯學院都要以到寰南來、他們的教管方　當然也？出這個原則叩、　民革社、</p>

<h3>向青年提出四個要點</h3>
<p>— 沈鈞儒</p>
<p>從前線農村生活說起　本報特稿</p>
<p>最近同郵韜奮先生等到前綿去了一　、我去的是第九戰區，詳細情形以時間關係不暇盡告，祇略談感想兩點，這便感想也可以說是最近到了前線去了，才轉發到的。</p>
<p>這兩點感想是：（一）對於最前線士兵的生活；（二）對於國內最大多數人的生活，就是農村生活。</p>
<p>先說前線士兵的生活。常有人問：「俞線士氣旺否？「我以爲這是不須問的，因爲對于我們的士兵和將領的勞苦和忠勇，還有什麼沽可說呢。事蹟舉不勝舉，我現在主要要談的還是他們的生活。他們的生活怎樣呢？他們的生活，可以說：沒有了所謂飲食起居，也沒有了所謂文化生活等等，不談十兵，就是將領，也往往一月半月看不到張報紙，那里談得到什麼精神糧食呢。至於另一種糧食，那麼，他們是常常一天半天不吃東西的。遭也並不定是食糧缺乏，而是沒有時間管到飢餓，也沒有時間燒飯。　起東西來，總有烟，總有火光，而這足以引起敵人注意，要發生問題的。往往在燒飯的時候，一有風吹草動，便只得作罷了。飲食（尤其是飲一實在不易解决。在前線。吃不到榮蔬。老百姓是跑開了，田里沒有東西，這樣，維他命自然缺少，而體力上受了影響了。關於這菜蔬問題，我在南昌時，聽人說：輸送很困難。因爲交通工具缺乏，而就是輸送起來，比菜蔬更重要的東西正多着，自然不能先送　蔬。前線的吃實在很成問題，譬如食鹽等等，也非常缺乏。</p>
<p>前線無所謂『起居』，往往到需要睡時，不能睡，沒有定時。又比如　衣之類，實在不祇是天冷了才需要；士兵的睡覺，總常常睡在露天有，往往淸晨醒來，胸前盡濕，極易受病。俏使的了棉背心，那就比較好了。</p>
<p>還有生病的問題，這使士兵更痛苦。不祇士兵而　，就是那在所謂『前線的後方』的較高軍事機關中的職員，也有很多生病的。痢疾和瘧疾最多，金鷄納霜幷非沒有，但是分配太不够了，芷仕發冷發熱的時候，自然只有休息，但是些徵好一點就得起來擎槍準。他們是邊病邊打的，自大病着，一到晚上，就又打起仗來了。這一種的情形，實在　人感動。前線行路都在晚上，我們在沉寂中黑暗中，聽到　兵和病兵的呻黔之聲，我們只有感動，只有慚愧興不安。</p>
<p>在此抗戰時代，他們是眞巳盡了最僚大最神聖的任務，但是他們的生活却是如此！這是可以而且應當改善的，只要前後方聯繫得好，後方多出些力，多出些錢，總可以比較好一點的吧。我們後方的人實在對不起前方將士！</p>
<p>再如所謂義神食糧，現在後方的人都說要輪送書報到前線去。事實上這還是空話。因為那些書報，事實上只能送到副官處以及司令部等等地方爲止，决不能送到最前線的士兵手裏。而且，這書報是否能安慰他們，還是問題，就從容積方面說：我們平常看的大幅的報紙，他們在壞溝里是不便看的。他們只能看小一點的紙張。我希望文化界今後注書這一點。讀物要小型的，而內容不能浪費筆墨，因爲他們需要經濟精力和時間。寫信方法應　簡潔，扼要，明快，……使他們一看就朋白是寫的什麼才好，但是這樣的刊物，在後方在實還少得很，文化界倘眞心要改善最前線將士的生活，一點也非做　不可！</p>
<p>其次，再談鄉村生活。</p>
<p>中國的農村裏的生活，是可以推想得到的。在鄉村里，無論男女老少，都是面黃肌瘦，不活潑，不偷快，他們所吃的苦，决非城里人所可忍受，他們住的房子，很簡陋，破敗。非常的不衛生，臥房多不是透一點光的，因爲沒有窗築戶實夜黑漆漆，脚底下還是爛尼地，鄕寸的建，。書在非根本予以改浩不可。至於他們的飲食，便得很，他們所吃的，喝的東西，對他們的身體壞簡值是不能想像的壤。自從農村破產以後，中國的農村里，是處處表現着生活之窮苦的。還有，鄕　里不識字的文盲多極了。他們不能像我們置聯得到識字之樂，他們不能獄得智識，以影響其生活。他們常常終年不難開一塊地方，這是他門沒有智識的一個原因。抗戰已經一年多，但農村里，却還有好多問了他茫然不知所對的人。</p>
<p>看了前綫十兵和鄉村農民的生活以後，我想到「青年應該刻苦』這句話，是有因的。今日之下，我們的生活，實在應以最前綫的生活爲鏢準。靑年人和文化人的責任，是改革社會，使那種種使人看了石安的地方，得以改變。因此，我們應該對我們的生活有所决定；我們的生活到底應該怎樣？現任各方面都在希望靑年，各方面都希望靑年負起改革的實任來，前綫的將領，血下正在熱切希望靑年們去做下敵軍官，希望靑年們受軍事教育。在行政方面，大家又希望靑年去做下級行政官員，目下往　有許多地方的縣長，不能與車隊好好聯繫，好的配合，不知道負責任，×人來了也不管。所以，現在砟地都需要好縣長，需要有智識，有能力，身體强，對抗戰熱誠，面甚至渝陷後還能領導民衆打游羣的好縣長。而這，大家都屬望於靑年，目下各方所　望於靑年者，幷不是空空洞洞而是希望實際負責，但是，在我們靑年方面應該怎樣呢？我們還覺得自己要學習，靑年們還需要努力改造自己，培譽自己。面工作，一面在工作中學習。根據一般的經驗，靑年做事力量總要强些，但靑年也有缺點，如經騐不够等，都不能巡視。</p>
<p>現在我想出四點，希望靑年朋友們加以攷慮：</p>
<p>第一點：要切實。——靑年往往太偏於理想，因此眞正有辦事之才的靑年幹部很缺乏，所以，要切實。一切要有具體的辦法。儘管眼光看得很還，却不能徒有幻想，比如一個人眼睛可以咖到很速的地方，脚底下却沒有辦法。不能一跨就跨到那里，必須一步一步的走。無論碰到什麼事，都要當機立斷。</p>
<p>第二點：要偉大——我覺得，目下中國青年的團結，還不够得很。往往是把自己看得太重，不能容人。却造成了種種的分別，種種的隔閔，已經到了必須一致團結外禦其侮的時候了，却還不肯團結起來。這是很不好的。我們應該把心胸懷抱偉大起來。</p>
<p>第三點：要堅强——凡事判斷明確後，便應堅强地做去，不能動搖。——是意志的堅强。另外身體也要鍊得堅强，只有身體堅强的人才能担當艱巨的事業。就此如我，雖則老了，但因身體還强還能耐苦，所以還能勉强做得一些事情。</p>
<p>第四點：要寧靜——「寧靜以致遠」，是諸葛武侯的教訓。這兩個字是極好的，很不容易闡明，我想把開車子作例子來解釋。開汽車的時候，第一要心思專一，開的時候不能想到別的事情，否則就要發生問題了。說一句笑話，開汽車的哲學就是『心無二念』。這是寧靜的根本。第二是前進。開汽車的時候，只有前進，沒有倒退。第三要檢查自己，開汽車的時候，人與汽車是合爲一體，我就是汽車，汽車也灶是我，汽車臨開，務必把自己汽車上的機件，水匣等一一檢查淸楚。看有無毛病，足爲進行阻礙，寧靜工夫最重要的也就是自己檢查自己。第四，注意滿街行動。開汽車時，須注意前後左右一切人和物的行動，注意是否有人走過來，必如此寧靜方不是個死體。第五，避免正面衛突，因爲衝突，幷不能一定達到排除障礙目的，而是必致於連自己（汽車）也不保，應止卽止。非走曲線不可的時候，就必走曲線，應下車則下車，說服了城取去了阻礙，再向前行，如此寧靜方有作用。</p>
<p>我的話應該結束了。總之，我到前線去看到了前線戰士們的生活，和鄉村里農民的生活以後，便想到我們的責任，應該是去改善他們的生活，以增强抗戰力量，而靑年尤其應該負起責任來，但是，改善多教人的生活這一件事，是要不雌艱苦的人，能力强的人，才能做得起來的，所以我向靑年提出這四個要點，切實，偉大，堅强，寧靜。</p>

<h3>陶行知先生談　香港的教育問題</h3>
<p>— 卓奇</p>
<p>辦學應該有宗旨，不可以賺錢為目的</p>
<p>陶行知先生縱談戰時的一般教育問題，記者嘗有特寫發表於元旦的本報。陶先生對於香港的教育又有什麼感想與指示呢？這個更逼近在身邊的問題，更是有心人所關切的重要問題。現在，就讓記者將訪問陶先生所得的結論擇要爲讀者報道，尤其要請各校當局與文化教育界加以重視。</p>
<p>一座樓，一塊招牌學生繳着昂貴的學費，老師『照書念書』，交易而退，各得其所，什麼人格感化，什麼民族意識，就讓它是教育學上的死名詞。這樣的教育，實在使我們感到頭痛。劈頭第一個要請教陶先生的問題，當然是這個教育商業化的問題。</p>
<p>陶先生的答案是這樣的『我們不能苛實香港一般學校收費的勗貴，因爲學校沒有基金，教員餓着肚皮怎樣辦學？在資本主義社會之下，知識亦變成商品，買與賣的形式亦是免不了的，問題的結是學校除了收實之外，還應該有一個辦學的宗旨。循着辦學的宗旨努力苦幹下去，這還是未可厚非。要是收了費就萬事俱休，糊里糊塗地什麼亦不管，純粹的以賺錢爲目的，那就無可寬恕了，至於教育的實施，最低限度每週應該有一次時事解譯。在明白時事之後，膏年人一定會警覺到祖國對他的希望，一定會覺悟對只是曉得英文還是不够用的。』</p>
<p>陶先生的答案雖然很簡單，意思卻十分扼要。第一是不苛貴資本主義社會下教育之商業化，『第二是應該有辦學的宗旨，最低限度每週應該有一次時事解釋。</p>
<p>第二個問題是香港一部份學生的思想問題，記者以一個靑年朋友的遭遇作體爲具的例子：她是本港某中學的學生，在戲院看到銀幕上映出英勇的八百將士和飄揚的國旗的時候，就很敏感地站立致敬。可是全院只有她一個人站立着，使卑視與駭異的視綫還集中在她的身上，她覺得非常難爲情。他對于愚昧的一羣是予以原諒的。可是悻悻然却不服同學亦如此糊塗。囘到學校辯論的時候，同學們還用似是而非的話來澆她一把冷水</p>
<p>陶先生笑着說：『這是她的技術還不够。她應該簡單的說明致敬的理由，喊大家一齊站立起來，那時候，必定有一部份受感動亦響應起來，就是沒有站立的亦不敢恥笑人家，是嗎？她很熱心愛國，可是，勇氣還不够！……』記者跟着陶先生亦笑了起來。</p>
<p>第三個問題是文化人逃難到香港的苦悶問題。</p>
<p>隨着淪陷區城的擴大，文化人亦被迫而洮難到香港來。數量之多，博士就佔一百二十人以上。其他教職員，學生，作家，記者……竟不計其數。這一大批知識份子敏感的亦不少、閒散在香港備嘗種種難堪的刺激，意志稍爲不堅定的就立即呈現動搖悲觀，頹廢……的領向。在全國總動員的呼聲高唱入雲，內地缺乏幹起的恐慌之中，一方是有人沒事做一面是有事沒人做，遭是多歷矛盾的現象！</p>
<p>陶先生的答案是：『在香港沒有工作做的要回到國內去工作。博士要幾百元的差事在這個年頭當然不易找得。其實，要做事隨處部有工作做，趙老太太只曉得『趙洪文國』四個字，怎麼她就有事情幹？怎麼她到處受人歡迎？應該人去找事，不可等事來找人。……』</p>
<p>聽到遭裏，記者挿着嘴的說：『的確亦有很多靑年願苦幹爲國效努，奈何請樓無路！』</p>
<p>陶先生接着就說：『動員工作現在鄒有淮步了；囘到國內找工作做，在目前是不怎樣成問題的』。</p>
<h3>大觀影片公司賭案判決　趙樹燊陳誠嘉開賭有罪　婦慰會代表蒞庭否認知情　趙陳均判罰十元其餘警戒</h3>

<h3>香港住客聯合會</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>和負責人的一席談話</p>
<p>爲着逃避×人的摧殘，幾十萬同胞，匯注到這個安樂窩般的香港來。於是昔日無人過向的空樓，都搶租一空，一部份業主又乘火打劫，增加租值。無量數的同胞，因之而迫遷，無量數的同胞，因之而露宿，整個香港都曾爲之沸動。時到令日，迫遷的風潮，表面上似巳靜止，可是在暗中波湧的還是指不勝屈。於是籌備巳久的港九住客聯合會，便趕速成立，於昨天的下午，假座勝斯酒店，舉行成立典禮，招待記者，報告敘備經過。在無量數住客阢隍不寧的今天，這個會誕生的意義是非常重大的。</p>
<p>未屆開會，各方來賓已紛紛蒞臨，這時三五成羣，聚到火爐旁邊；或圍坐桌子裏，談談笑笑。熊熊的烈火映到各人的臉上，泛作胭脂顏色，談到無良的業主逼遷，各人均咬牙切齒，遍體滾熱；不知是火暖融融呢，抑是怒潮的高湧。左邊脫，『安居然後樂業』；右邊說，『業主的迫遷實無異擾亂社會秩序的安寧』。坐在一旁的『伯父』嘆口氣說：『有些住客受着屋主和二房東雙重的壓迫，這不更凄凉嗎？』各人聽到了，都默然無語！</p>
<p>談到會員的資格問題，裏面的籌備委員說，『照會章不獨凡是件客可以加入，就是案主也歡迎他來婦的，因爲會章規定有調解會員糾紛的條例　』，旁邊的一位客人挿語道：『業主和住客是風馬牛不相及的，旣因對抗迫選業主面成立這個會，而希望業主加入住客的陣線，這不是一回滑稽事嗎？』負責人聽了沉吟片嚮道：這個問題頗值研究呀！</p>
<p>跟着又談到中下階唇，受壓迫最慘，所以特別歡迎住床位的客人入會，假如他能够按章繳費的話；不過床位住客大多數是些貧的苦中下階級，每日租值不過一塊至兩塊錢，他能依照章程一次繳納參塊四亳錢的入會年費和基本金嗎？負責人也沉吟片嚮道：『這個問題也頗值研究呀！』</p>
<p>業主無理的迫遷，自然會惹起訴訟，住客會自然是帮助會員的，那末一切吃官司訴訟的費用，當然是會內担當的哪？負責人也沉吟片時道：『這也值得研究呀』！</p>
<p>所謂業主無理的逼屬，但究竟如何才是無理，拿甚麼來做標準呢？『當然是依照是拿政府規定業主加租，不能超過百分之廿五這例爲根據哪，』負責人肯定的說，不過，屋客如果受了業主的壓迫，一經訴訟當局自然會引用這一條例，而用不着住客聯合會去操心的。</p>
<p>續談到當局所須佈的保障住客的條例，內中有很多還未盡善之點，如住客所受損失還不及業所受損失之重大者，業主得要求住客遷出』。『這例予業主很多迫濕的機會，關於這一類的問題，我們很想完全拿來彙集呈給政府，呼籲予以改善呀！一在這位負責人所談這許多話掌中，這該是一句比較如人意的談話吧！</p>

<h3>巴黎香柔麗色大街巡禮記</h3>
<p>香柔麗色（Champs　Elysees）是亡黎最美麗動人的一條大街、也是全世界設計最佳的通衛、凡是初到巴黎的遊客、第一個勝境、而爲巴黎所能供獻的、便是香柔麗色、我到了巴黎之後、所要觀光的地方雖然很多、但杳柔麗色却是一個重要目的地、是一個晴和的早晨、雨綫住了、街道上還是很潮濕、我披了雨衣、匆匆的走到國立美術阮（Louvre）出了美術院的方場、驟然地晚離了都市的塵囂、而到了另一個淸幽絕谷的境界、繞着我的四週的、祗是些碧由油的草地、　彩色紛披、鮮艷欲流的奇葩、前面是一個圓場、中間也種行不少的花草、設計成各種不同的圖案、追便是卡羅賽爾場、汽車可以從美術院的左門進來、德道這圓場、再從美術院的右門出去、戰過圓塲、矗立在面前的、是卡　賽爾凱旋門（Are　de　Trfomp-he　duCarrouscl）這座凱旋門、比較星場（Place　de　Letofee）的大凱旋門小多了、它全高僅四十八尺、闊六十三尺、深二十一尺、是拿破崙一世時興建紀念他一八〇五年和一八〇六年兩次戰勝的、這座凱旋門雖速不及星場的那座壯闊、可是設計得也異常精雅、原設計大是名美術家Fontaine和Percier兩氐、係以羅馬凱旋門爲藍本的、上面刻着有關戰爭的許多浮彫、都是當時各大藝術家精心結構炎作、比較有趣柴的、有上層的一種四馬拖曳的戰軍、這輛戰車已不是當年原物了、在拿破崙建築這座凱旋鬥時、戰車原是從大利威尼斯奪來的戰利品、當然、這是拿翁拿來代表他們戰勝紀念的、一八一四年法國戰收、這輛戰車大爲意國的要求、　得從凱旋門的頂上拆下來、歸還意大利、後來法王路易十八、另行配製了一輛安上、那便是留存在現在的原物了、這座凱旋門的歷史快二百年了、它親看到法國歷朝的興亡盛衰、現在它也飽　風　、剝落不堪、無復當年的雄姿了、</p>
<p>由這座凱旋門向前走去、不久便到了緞勞梨花園、(Jardin　de　Tuilerise)花園的上間、有一條寬大的走道、可是車輛是不能通過的、座花園、面積不過五十畝左邊、　樹木花卉、她台　榭、佈置劉楚楚有致、點綴在紛紅駭綠的中間的、則有、噴泉和美術彫刻、　一帶原　以往的宮禁、貧破侖一世在位時也駐蹕於此、不幸後求去國發生了幾次革命、這座宮殿、也一再的遭受了破壞、最後、是一八七一年吧、共黨佔據巴黎、這所巍峨的緞勞梨王宮、也付諸一炬、現在的花園便是當年的宮址、滄海桑田、眞是不堪囘首了、</p>
<p>走上了醉人的緞勞梨花園、湧現在眼前的、就是馳名全球的『和諧廣場』（Place　de　la　Concorde）、就我個人的估　、這廣　的週圍、至少總有半英里、北邊是海軍部、南邊鄰聖因河、東邊接緞勞梨花園、西面就是柔麗色大街了、記得蘇東坡有句名言、他說、　凡物皆有可觀、苟有可觀、皆有可喜」、我覺得在遊覽名勝的時候、如果時時懷着一種欣賞憑吊的情緒、那裏、自然是『凡物皆可觀」、非但可親、並且可喜了、同一樣東西、在善於考據的人看來、愛不忍釋、在另一人看來、也許覺得平凡而不值一顧、我認爲遊覽而沒有欣賞憑吊的能力、實在是一件最可惜的事、我爲什麼忽然談到這些呢、因爲和諧廣場、在普通人看來、祗是一個車水馬龍的熱鬧地方、匆匆走過就完了、豈知這所廣場、却句含着不少有趣味的史料、而在法國歷史上佔着很重要的一頁呢、</p>
<p>廣塲的中央、矗立着一塊碑石、組粗一看、似乎十分平凡、如果考據一下、、那麼、這塊石碑、却有它的來歷、碑名Obe　isk　of　Lnxor高七十六尺、重二百四十噸、是一八三一年埃及王送給法干路易腓力勃的、我們想一想、道樣碩大無朋的巨石、在當時如何能從埃及運到巴黎的呢、似乎是一個啞謎了、根據史籍、這座巨碑到一八三六年繼安放在『和諧廣塲」、由此推算、它在中途搬運所耗的時間、總近五年了、在當時爲了一方巨石、也不知耗却多少人力物力、專制時代帝王的淫威、往往可以造成一種不可造成的事物、中國的萬里長城、埃及的金字塔、不是很顯著的例子嗎、</p>
<p>巨碑兩勞各有一大噴水池、分爲幾會形如燭臺、噴射高度、約達三十尺、正中一管、直向上空噴去、下面四週還有若干小管、向中間噴去、濺珠飛玉、煞是好看、在巴黎的許多噴泉裏、也許以言兩座爲最偉大最美麗了、我們望着這座廣大的圓塲、以及熙熙攘攘往來不絕的軍馬行人、似乎這個地方只有愉快及和諧了、然而如果我們回想到法國的歷史那麼、這『愉快」及『和諧」會得立卽消逝、『變而爲一嚴　』與『恐怖』了、原來在十八世紀的末年、法國戰亂紛乘、自一七九三年正月赴、到一七九四年七月止、巴黎是陷在極度恐佈的氛圍裏、這塊『和諧廣場』、正是那時殺人的刑塲、法王路易十八、王后瑪麗安多納的被殺、就是在這裏執行的、其餘王室貴青、以及後來的革命黨人、時而殺人、時而被殺、種種慘劇、都在這裏的斷頭台上演出的、想到這裏、似平路易十六上斷頭台的情形、又浮現在面前、多麼可怖呀、</p>
<p>「和諧廣塲』的汽車往來如梭、行人們要穿過馬路、却不是一件容易事、我繞道海軍部門前、守候了十餘分鐘、方機到達香柔體色的入口、香柔麗色大街的入口有兩座石像、上圍雕刻着一匹怒馬、正在縱糧奔馳、勞邊一個人持着一綫、顯示着很焦急的模樣、神態飛逸、確是美術名機、香柔豐色的本身、可分爲兩大部分、一部分自東端和諧廣塲人口起到圓點（Rond　Point）止、這一段約摸半里之遙、完全是一個公園、大街就在很大的公園中穿過、街道的旁邊、是兩排很整齊的梧桐樹、樹旁則爲人行道、人行道的旁邊、各有四排的樹木、修剪整齊、蔚然深秀、樹旁再有若干地段、那便是花園了、所以這一段香柔麗色街是在樹林花園的中間、花園裏面、有亭榭、有噴泉、有燦爛的花卉、有美麗的池塘、一到下午、這一帶的座椅上、便逗留着不少的遊客、兒童的樂園、也設在園裏、裏面有各棰新奇的科學玩意見來灌輸孩子們的智識、</p>
<h3>成都的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 徐爾音</p>
<p>衣　在廣東和廣西、我們所看到的都是短裝、長衫難得有人着、但是任成都、我們所看到的都是長衫、穿短裝是稀有的、恰巧相反、成都還通行馬褂、而且不但中老人才用、年靑人也省不了、我的一個同學、過去在上海時西裝呢帽、囘到成都四年、　輕綢袍、黑馬袍、頭戴瓜皮小帽子了、公務人員自然是着中山裝的、但因爲大半公務人員都有點弓背形、胸部永遠挺不出來、所以穿　中山裝還是打不起精神、學生、自然是一律的灰色芝蔴布學生裝、　許多四川的學生時常進茶店、打開項頸上的扣子、把皮帶按在茶几上、像心縱意地坐不像坐、睡不像睡般倒在竹　子裏、這樣子可比長衫馬褂的遺少更不上限、</p>
<p>女人的衣服則和各處一樣、從古代起到歐化、都可以看到、</p>
<p>在街上、特別引起初來者的注目的是喇嘛們、暗紅色的長袍、普通回族的衣、跟他們的食住行一樣、是完全跟我們相同的、</p>
<p>食　說起成都的食這一門來、眞是一紙難書、川菜是有名的、不用說、更使人念念不忘的、却是要到了成都才能嘗到的許多小吃、</p>
<p>到成都第一晚、我就被我的同學遠進一家小吃店、招牌上寫着『吳抄手』、我心裏想、大槪由出色的姓吳的廚司得名的吧、一聽同學叫『抄手兩份』、才知道抄手是一種食品、問同學、原來抄手者、蝕餛也、廣東店裏的雲吞是作、除了吳抄手還有矮子抄手葉得貴、都是幹凈的、但是小小的門面、却都是刻刻客滿、自然名不虛傳、小小的一碗、管教尔討添、那味道是說不出的、總之、跟成都所有的小吃、有幾個共同的好處、價廉是其一、物美是其二、吃不飽是其三、</p>
<p>荔枝巷的水餌子、可惜一定要加大量的『紅』、不會吃辣的吃起來、美味就議辣味趕走了、</p>
<p>蒸　子一客十隻、只可抵他處的一隻至兩隻、全部放在嘴裏、也不嫌多、賴湯圓和廿四春、湯圓之佳、無出具右、</p>
<p>總而言之、成都是一個古香古色的城市、而成都有的是不傷脾胄的「頹廢的點心」、如周作人先生所說、惜乎周先生竟不想到北平之外還有這樣一個好地方、</p>
<p>住　自然、成都也有貧民窘、那是在城外和還處、</p>
<p>在城內、截然不同、歐化的是春熙路、商業塲上的商店、古風猶存的則是少城、這一邊的住宅區的大中小公館、</p>
<p>公館無論大中小、第一、門斗一定很像樣、第二、門口一定懸一盞紅燈、第三、在頭門與二門之間、一定坐一個白髪的門頭、這門頭也許是半身不遂的、也許是雙目失明的、而且十個有九個愛打瞌睡、所以進出的人是不致於每次都受阻擋的、據說、這僅僅是爲了要使『公館像個公館能了』、</p>
<p>進得二門、你可以看見一兩株枯樹、三四枝細竹、五六盆菊花、一個寬大的容堂、一個死氣沉沉的院子、</p>
<p>成都人的住、大槪和他們的行一樣、也是保持着十足的官僚氣的、</p>
<p>行　成都人少出門、成都九里三分、他們說他們自巳就在這九里三分內打一生團團、一出牛市口、便變成了不得了、到上海也叫留學、　省府裏就可以領到留學費、留學回來　不爭聘、在外面擊了些什麼在所不問、</p>
<p>但成都人還是不愛行動、他們捨不得安安逸逸閒閒散散的成邵、</p>
<p>成都人走在街上、大半是沒有什麼事的、也許是剛　茶店裏出來、也許是要到什麼『得意　』『頤和園』『不如蹄』去品茗、他們總是走得非常之慢、所以、連人力車也只好慢慢的走、因爲人行道和馬路、除有要人經過的汽車是不得不讓外馬路中央一樣有悠然的散步者</p>
<p>成都汽車少、人力車多而賤、幾可爲全國冠、有馬有騾有公車、有轎、有滑竿、有木船、有木炭公路車、蜀道不難、難在缺少現代交通工具而已、但得也還行、</p>

<h3>日軍鏟除「青年帳」　東北農產連年衰減</h3>
<p>東北義勇車常利用高梁麥出爲蔽身之處、從事游擊戰、神出鬼沒、頗使日軍應付爲難、故近年極力限制種植高粱、提倡改種大豆棉花、假振與特產之名、行屠識戰爭之實、然豆園花地、義勇軍尚能藏身、故每一戰起、農產物卽被剷掘洩憤、在此情形之下、東北之農產收獲量、當然已較九一八前激減矣、加以各地戰亂迄無休止、農民時作時輟、盧案發生以來、東北子弟又被迫人伍、開拔入關與同胞目相格殺、影響所及、農產收成當然更糟、試據山崎經濟研究之調查統計、一九三四至三六年間東北農產平均收穫量、巳較一九二七至三一年間平均穫量減少百份之十六點五、本年農產收穫估計、二次又較初次估計爲少、試列表比較如次：</p>

<h3>昨宵女子籃球賽　港大西南均得勝</h3>
<p>【本報特訊】萬家燈火齊明後、籃球房內動干戈、按照秩、宵來本有三幕女子籃球賽舉行子建身室、首塲雪花對港大、次塲西南對聖保羅、末塲梅芳對思想、後來因為思思棄欄、祇有兩塲而巳、</p>
<p>對迷們心中有數、知道昨夕的演出必無甚可觀、因此臨出觀客、除了啦啦隊和球員外、正眞球迷、少之又少、</p>
<p>首場來打還比較緊張有趣些、至于次塲、則不足稱道了、</p>
<p>六時半屆、戰幔即啓、港大有文華在前線、極爲活軌、頻向霉花陣地戰踏、但這時　出各將、還見努力、曼虹、俏、演出却還可以、直至第一節終、六比五零花佔先一點、</p>
<p>再戰　、文蘭演出很妙、擲　亦殊準備、而鄒德範也爲　文華供球機會特多的緣故、　芒　露、所以這節終港大以反十二比十一成的績、形勢好轉、</p>
<p>下半塲　花陣脚搖動、守多於攻、反視港大、文華、德範、極爲活躍、經過一番劇爭後、廿一比十八、霉花更爲落後、</p>
<p>末節　　雖極力掙扎、亦不能打破僵局、且各求勝心切、射籃多欠準繼、粘果、十九比廿七見敗、</p>
<p>（總分廿七）</p>
<p>（總分十九）</p>
<p>第一幕戰事旣完、第二塲競爭卽起、接屬後、瑞心先開、錄、氣餤迫人、但一瞬眼、保羅敬回一隻、打　平手、此後保護還想努力、怎奈技不如人、祇限見西南績分繼續增多、自己却是兩袖清風、一節旣完、二比十六、</p>
<p>第二節開始、西南以勝利在握、不爲已甚、調出配枝、瑞心等、以月嫦、湘浣替代、但是雖然經過　番人事更動、實力依然比保羅優勝多多、所以完了上半場、保羅仍不免以五比二十屈居人下、</p>
<p>下半場雙方都有進展、但保　在先損失已多、一時未易打回打平手、其實保護所以有得分機會、純然是由于西　各將寬大之故、否則恐怕不易有所獲、是節元、廿七比十西南遙遙領先、</p>
<p>末節西南演中固　、保護方面、也有不少擲籃機會、但因婉蓮、曼娥擲球欠準、所獲無多、此後西南氣勢更盛、頻有建樹、瑞心、配枝、幾有每投之中之妙、直至全塲結東、三十三比十二、西南姐　高呼勝利而趣、（籃底人）</p>
<p>（總分卅三）</p>
<p>（總分十三）</p>

<p>南華會足球健將楊水益、前被具妻梁秀英、票控上案、謂其一九三七年十一月、至去年六月之間、在大抗施弼街十五號樓下、將其虐待、要求分居、及給與會餐費、此案經由中央巡理府畢司判令將控票註銷、告人　秀英不服、特延劉瑞麟律師、轉請利榮根人律師、上訴於高級法庭、昨晨十時油正副按察司麥基利基礎及連業會審、開庭後、被告楊朮益因往西貢賽球、未有到堂、劉瑞驥律師樓通爭李更生登臺供述日前派交通知書與被告經過、證明被告知悉此車、供　、</p>

<p>髪妻填房　意旨明顯</p>
<p>該條例所指髪妻與塡房、在立法上之意旨、至爲明顯、余以爲不過文字上之修辭。其所指者唯有一義、而不須援引巳經廢止之條、泛混解釋也、該條例中并無雙字制限其適用于某特　期開、所採行之特定儀式、亦無排除立法當年所存在之婚　顯示、其實上述結婚儀式、爲中國、法上所規定之唯一力式也、裁判官竟擬對該條例之解　、予以限制之規定、基立于錯誤之假定、曲解其字義、本律師認爲此實錯誤、蓋立執意旨對『妻』或『結婿婦』宇樣之解、并無加以限制也、抑該條例幷非實作婚姻上之規定、則　造之天　關係、自屬存在、本案唯一果戰、厥爲兩造之結婚、是否係依照中國法律、及習慣所規定是耳、倘其答案、係肯定的、則本條例所定之要件、巳完全具備云、　後利大律師謂兩造員經遵行中國法律成習惜所定之方式結婚、興該條例所規定者、自愿　用、裁判官所判决、係屬鐵誤云</p>

<h3>田徑運動訓練法</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>身體發靑不平衡、或一部份肌肉過於發達、皆爲下正常的現象、田徑運動家應與香樂家無異、其各部動作必須互相和合；不僅在身體上、卽在動作上介不可獨自一部而忽視其他。例如、有許多田賽運動家以爲　鐵餅或擲鐵球時最好的方法或最美妙的姿勢就是當鐵餅或鐵球適擲出時、那隻在擲前用來支持身體重量的脚、卽後脚、應同已跨至另一隻脚之前。這種錯誤求見解的弊害、就是使　些田賽運動家因過於注重這部動作、在運動時急於將修脚跨至前脚之前、以致在鐵餅或戰球尚未離手之前、兩脚巳同時跳起、雄開地面、於是身體懸空、身體和手臂皆不受兩腿支持；須知臂部欲有强大的推　或拋擲的能力、　須依靠肩背各部之外、尚須積臀腿各部、　身體支撑於地上、否則雖有强人的臂力、亦不能有優良的成績、</p>
<p>在擲鐵球等時、兩腳交換位置的動作實際上就是牛頓運動第三定律、「每個動作皆有與具相等的反作用」；國脚交換位置的動作也是因爲身體重心轉移之故</p>
<p>又如跳高和撑竿跳高、肖許多運動家在練習跳高時祇注重身體扭轉、和身體伸展姿勢、在練習撑竿跳高時亦祇注重將身體起動作、他們以爲是成功的要訣、於是那些跳高運動家忽視了正確而有力倒剌和跳躍的動作、有時亦會因身體扭轉過早、以致妨　跳躍的動作、而不能盡力跳躍、　樣那些撑竿跳高運動家也　視了奔　或衝刺跳躍以及身體向上燈題的動作、而獨重機身指撑　的動作、其實如奔跑、衝刺、跳躍等動作得法、在跳高架上不難有正確和美妙的姿勢、將身體據起的動作也能正確而有力、如未及時而先將身體撐起、不僅能使身體　轉、亦能影響腹部的力量、</p>
<p>構成這種觀念的主因就是那些拍攝著名運動家奔跑、跳高、挪鐵球等姿勢的照片。那些照片實葬送了不少很有希望的靑年運動家、許多以為這就是正確的姿勢、或是成功的要訣、例如賽跑。普遍的照片多拍攝到羅終點時的情形。須知當我們到達終點時已費去大量的氣力。身體也必很　乏、並目還要出盡全力來作最後的掙扎、於是便不能保持正確的姿勢、就是最著名的運動家也不免如此。他們獲得勝利並不在這一刹那之間、我們在照片上見到的大多數並不是在他們成功的訣要。又如一　高的動家在打破了紀錄之後、常有些攝影記者等請他將　高的姿勢再去　一次。但所跳的高度遠在打破紀錄時的高度之下、拍攝了照片之後、一般人看了就以爲這便是那个打破記錄的運動家成功的要訣、於是都　做傚這个姿勢、須知不但　个跳高運動家的成功的要訣不在這一剎那之間、況且他表演時的姿勢並不完全和他打破記錄時的姿勢相同、至於低欄、高欄、跳遠、以及擾亂球、擲標槍等、當一今運動家在跳起或　剌的時候、多數滿影記者邵喜歡蹲下來打攝他的姿勢、曾樣的攝出來的照片也不能作爲一種參考的材料、以為在這種照片中、單　身體的角度、我們看到的並不是那个運動家在跳高或衝刺時身體原有角度、一方面因爲常那些攝影記者拍攝的時饒、身體是蹲下來的、一方面攝影機的也常常歪斜、（上）</p>
<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……海角遊魂</p>
<p>Algfers</p>
<p>故事的背量是一個神秘寄怪得像「天方之談」中所描寫邊的地方、地名叫阿爾吉、雌則現在是法國的屬地、城市的一部份相當現代化、但另一在屬於土著居住的部份、却仍完全保留皆東方古代的神秘色　、在那里是無法無天、賊匪和亡命之徒會聚的所在、導演把這麼的一個背景、處押得極盡陰森書殺的能事、更襪着一段動人的故　、匪徒們陰險殘暴的行動、使每一寸照片、都充滿着神秘、恐怖、強烈的剌激力量、</p>
<p>故事敍述一個國際劇盜、亡命混跡右這地方、同黨的出賣、警探的團捕、都給他狡脫、獨獨屈龍在一個美預的法國女郎——而喪失了生命、</p>
<p>却爾斯鮑育在此片中對于匪的性格、有極深刻的表現、當演「慾燄」的女主角、希地拉瑪、演技也優秀、薛烈嘉利、她在第一部片、『馬可勃羅遊華記』中、飾忽必烈女兒的時候、留給我們一個極良好的印象、在此片中鋒一個盡情盡意、熱戀着那劇盜的土着女郎、那種出色的演技、是值得我們特別讚賞的、</p>
<p>皇后……鐵翼英雄</p>
<p>Men　Wfth　Wfngs</p>
<p>全片叙述三四十年來美國航空事業的與化中、也可說是人類征服太空的經過、作一頁系統的叙述、同時我們當承認、這也是有電影史以來、一部偉大而有價值的作品、</p>
<p>故事取材似乎太廣汎、因之情節沉長、令人略感劇力的不足、但是種種緊張驚險的塲面、完全掩飾了這個缺點、像飛行遇險、空中大血戰、出死人生的試驗飛行、第一次橫渡大西洋的壯舉、這些都是極刺激力的場面、同時担憂忍泣的女人、這些這些、都是富有操縱觀衆情緒的力量、</p>
<p>彩色的採用於此片是再適合沒有了、以至各種韻色鮮艷的飛機翱翔在滿佈彩雲的蓝色空際、畫面的美屬、增加觀衆不少的美感、</p>
<p>弗萊麥克茂萊、雷密勒的演按、皆極精鍊、女主角魯蘇絲康員爾、是一個新進的明星、沒受人家多大的注意、在此中、我們發見她是一個極可造就的人材、</p>
<p>平安……軍械間牒黨</p>
<p>The　Soy　Ring</p>
<p>一部沒甚可取的間碟影片、編導者對於間諜們的活動體及胃險陰謀等情節、旣未能儀量發揮、更加上馬球賽和一些詼諧場面的勉强穿櫥、雜凑成這一部个倫不　的影片、</p>
<p>故事是叙述一班中際聞諜、怎樣在美國活動、想倫新發明的防空利器的圖樣、但因發明者的英勇伶俐、逐破減了他們的狡計、各濱員演技、也皆極平凡、</p>
<p>東方……第二世界</p>
<p>Flash　Gordon</p>
<p>外國的神怪片、憑着科學上的理想、創造各種奇怪的東西、挿人一段英雄美人的故事、權術上毫無價值可言、祇是合抱着好奇心的人的胃口、</p>
<p>大華—封鎖西班牙</p>
<p>Blockade</p>
<p>是一張寫戰爭時漢奸活動的影片、但一面却是暴露了戰爭的殘酷、這是作者特別件重的一點、導演用很活潑的　頭、反轉出轟炸、封鎖種種毒辣手段、亨利方達、曼黛琳卡洛見、演出也不差、</p>
<p>景星……棠隸歌聲</p>
<p>Sing　Your　Sinners</p>
<p>一張穿挿滑稽的音樂片、笑料很豐富、內中賽馬一塌旣緊張而又發笑、主角萍克勞斯貝及佛來麥茂蘭主演</p>
<p>中央……女人</p>
<p>國語片</p>
<p>由三年前的默片改攝面成全片的意識很正確、編者完全是替幾千年的女人不大得人們情的痛苦伸訴、整個說來、不見得比默片時進步、但書面較爲活潑、新進女星路明及其餘幾位演員、都見出色、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「麥與兵隊」值得讀嗎？</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>在七日的「星座」上，讀到樓佐君介紹『麥與兵隊」的書評，頗引以當異；在八日的「自由談一上，又讀到林悠如先生的書評「麥與兵隊」，認爲「不失爲優秀的作品」。林君說：</p>
<p>『日本法西斯的文學「評論家」綫野晃會指摘年來日本『戰爭文學』的失敗，說：「從來日本文壇上認爲了不起的作品，經過中國報紙雜誌翻譯過去登刊後，中國的人讀來，簡直是一篇抗日，侮日的好材料』，不　，這部在日本國內還很流行的『麥與兵隊』，我們讀了亦有此感．（！）它不獨同樣是「抗日」『侮日』的好材料。而且，還替我們的抗戰做了好些宣傳工作！』</p>
<p>樓佐君先則說：</p>
<p>「……可是值得我們提起的，却還有二本比較可以入眼的著作。另一本是石川達三的『未死的兵』一本是本文所論的『麥與兵隊」。</p>
<p>再則說：</p>
<p>『然而，這書却仍不失有一種的個值，因爲書中對于作戰時的困難，旅程中的遭遇，中國華人的勇敢，和日軍的脆弱，在某個範圍中，他起客觀地將事實記載了下來。而因了這稱客視的敘述，至少我們對于爲中華民挨求生存的神聖抗戰，能有若干的進一步的認識。」</p>
<p>兩個人的觀點，兩偭人的語氣，如出一轍，對於這樣的意見，我却不敢恭維</p>
<p>不錯、「麥與兵隊」在「日本國內還很流行」，不，簡直是以中日戰爭的題材的小說中最流行的一本。也許我們的「翻譯家」被這一事實薰紅了眼睛，同時又看到書中有少數處所「到某範園中客觀地將事記戰了下來」吧，就忘記了好的方面與壞的方面的價值的對比之高低了。</p>
<p>「麥與兵隊」在日本軍閥絕對的言論統制之下。爲什麼那樣流行呢？不知道有沒有人相信。是因爲它暴　了「中國軍人的勇敢，和日本的脆弱」？不知道有沒有人相信：是因爲它「替我們的抗戰做了好些宜傳工作」？我自己是不在信。林悠如君說：</p>
<p>『作者火野葦平是被認爲『皇軍』中的典型人物。』</p>
<p>樓佐君也說：</p>
<p>『火野　平日君愛國的典型人物，為數十年來軍國民教育結晶。對于參戰摡不明瞭其目的，對于戰爭也認爲是必然的事實。』</p>
<p>火野葦平也在「作奢的話』中自白道：</p>
<p>『在這壯大的戰爭觀念中，一切都不知不覺那變成盲目了。』</p>
<p>以這樣的人能，寫出替「我們的抗戰做了好些宜傳工作』的作品嗎？</p>
<p>陸軍省情報部長佐藤大佐批評這作品道：</p>
<p>『……一般地，戰爭的悽慘與悲哀，使作者的感情高漲，理性盲目，其筆鋒之所趨，易成爲反戰的記述；但是『麥與兵隊』的作者却不然，感情高漲之時，仍能復蘇其反省的理性力……超越生死，直接分　戰爭勝自之責任的義務感，表現于其平易之作中，此其特色之一，再一特色，爲以廣澳無際的麥之原野爲背景的巧妙之描寫，極能以地形的實感，調和在夏天的戰　上奮戰的勇士，在不知道戰場實景，後方國民之前，多方面地展開第一綫的戰場模樣。』</p>
<p>日本軍　是盡最大的努力，把這作品宜傳，使之成爲國民精神動員的工具，它之流行。其主要原因，即在於此，而我們的『書許家』，却稱之爲「替我們的抗戰做了好些宜傳工作」，譽之爲與『未死的兵』並駕齊驅！我能够說什麼話呢？</p>
<h3>兩個時代的距離</h3>
<p>— 孟起</p>
<p>昨晚接得了父親逝世的消息，當時呆了半響，祇覺自頂至踵，神經好似麻痺了一般，說不出還是悲痛；還是辛酸！</p>
<p>父親的去世，說起來是有罪過的，在我理解上，並不『突然』。是在我奔馳於陜川道中的時候，就得知父親害病的消息，那時眞是不勝『一則以喜，一則以懼』之感，所喜的是鋒飾餘生，父親等到底還是安全人間。所懼的是父親向來體栩强健，即小不舒服，也往往强自支持，不願稱疾，現在肯以病訊傳來，足見其勢非輕。於是一面趕路，一而發一長信囘家詳詢究竟。等我費盡了勁到達城都時，家里的復信，己在轉信的友人處等待很久，一拆封便曉得情形不好，因爲我一上眼就看得出不是父親的筆跡。我的父親是個最健筆的人，無論我走到那里，祇要通訊處一確定，一週來一封信是從來不會缺數的，而且每次來信總是細大不遣，對於我訓論尤其週詳摯切。我深記得，在貴州的時候，因爲去信簡略了些，大遭父親的訶斥，說是不要看電報式的信。到底給父親寫信的勤劬感動了，寫家信不敢十分倫懶。父親呢，越高興便信來得越多；他來信的次數和長度幾乎成了他身心健康的測量表。現在大家隔得那麼遠，別得那麼久，反呌人代筆寫信因此我悚然地知道父親病勢之沈東。</p>
<p>到了重麼之後，以親友及代筆者斷斷續績的來信中，知道父親臥病已達兩月，起始是牽掛在外的我們太厲害，以致飲食失常，終致成了慢性的心臟表弱症。父親本來件在××的鄉間。請了當地的醫生診治，豪無效騐，後來母親看看病勞不對，費盡心思。搬進城里。　診時中西醫生已經表示束手無策，就價麼奄奄地輾轉休蘇，拖延了四个多月！</p>
<p>父親害的究竟是什麼病，我現在還不知道，我看見一次來信說，有幾天父親在壯上鬧差要找我，那个阻止，他便要打。以我的不孝而父親率掛得心神錯亂，這怎麼不叫我感到澈骨的痛楚，</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>移山與填海</h3>
<p>— 費織</p>
<p>中國古來有個故事，是和『愚公移山』同樣出名的，那不用說就是『精衛塡海」，文人常常引用這個故事，和引用『愚公移山』一樣，來勉人以堅忍不拔，來講述「有志事竟成」的道理。</p>
<p>其實這兩個故事畢竟有多少分別，愚公的目的在移開門前的山，靠的是連接不絕的人力，「我死有子，子又生孫，孫又生子，而由不增加，何患而不平？」的確，以無限的人力來移有限的山，是可能的，繼要能　久。</p>
<p>填海就不同了，荷蘭的工程師也有失敗的時候，可見那是一件非常艱難的工夫，一隻海邊小島，就算不分晝夜的把「西山木石』搬到海裏，但波動的海水總要把它的「木石」劃到別處去，它要塡的是「東海」，但「木石」也許全沒有放到「東海」裏，努力　管努力，白費工夫還是白費工夫的。持久也沒有用。</p>
<p>所以，『愚公移山』，『精衛斕海』，雖然是同樣的堅忍不拔；但前者是知其可而爲之的，後者却是知其不可而為之，『有志事竟城』這眞理也有一定的限度，難道我們要把天上的月亮奪下來，有忘，有忘，便司以『竟成』了麼？</p>
<p>自然，知其不可而爲之，這是大聖人的精神，是值得提倡，值得尊重的；不過這精神對於大聖人是救世的决心，所以織值得尊重，若果把這精神用之於另一處所，我們對他的評價，就兩樣了。</p>
<p>比如說吧，和×戰判『和平』，和×人勾勾并搭，出賣民族利益，出賣國家歷史，這是四萬萬五千萬在戰鬥中的中國人民誓死反對的，誰這樣做。誰就要受到中國人民的打殺，假如一個人剛想這樣去做，就覺得那是不可能的，因而　了手，這還不失爲一個好漢：反之，若果爲着個人『甜益』，知其不可而爲之，他便立刻受到民眾的嚴厲公判而無所逃遁！</p>
<h3>夜渡</h3>
<p>— 新丁</p>
<p>日間暖和的空氣已消失了，代替它的是寒冽的海風。穿着單衣的流浪客，載滿了整日奔波的疲勞，照例踏上廳然大物的過海備渡，別了燈火煇煌的南國之島，向着夜色蒼茫的對岸駛去。</p>
<p>狹長的三　船輪，活像販賣豬狗的鐵籠，人是黑黝黝的擠着。賣鹵味，賣柑，賣脆花生的小販們，在人叢中穿梭似的流轉，嘈雜地喊着賣：江湖賣藥的先生，在鼓吹着他獨帥的「百病特效』良藥，這一片包涵社會百態的交響樂，奏着。奏着，紊亂了想獲得片刻寧靜的流浪客的心，不時打斷這孤獨者的沉思。</p>
<p>寒冽的海風，以苛刻尖酸的姿態，鑽進了單衣的隙縫，回答它的，祇有船舷迎擊着浪花的音響。</p>
<p>同首遙望島上，行列的燈光，電管，在海濱層層的建築物中，吐露出燦然的光芒；然而隱藏在這光芒裏的。有作爲商品出賣的媚笑，也有靈海廢出了軀殼的頹廢與腐爛；有曾爲荒島開闢而努力的血與汗，也有反抗剝削在壓力的呼號潜職。哦，山頂上橫過而整齋的路燈，不正是抗×示威大巡行的火炬麼？這火炬將永遠不會熄滅，永遠照耀着四萬萬五千萬人羣，爲正義自由奮鬥到勝利的祖途。</p>
<p>在渡中，載着數百憫歸心似箭的客，他們縱然也負着沉重的倦意，或是焦慮一家數口明天的食糧，可是他們面部的表情，都是一致朝着他們底目的着地，而我—這個從戰區流浪到島上的單身客，不知今夜可有淡薄之交的友人，肯爲我留宿一宵？</p>
<p>明天……在黑暗中我想起了明天，明天是光明的，明天有我們萬千弟兄的怒吼，明天看妖魔在我們足下奔逃！我將整個的希望付托了明天吧，然而，夜渡在黑暗彌漫的海灣中，放出了沉着洪而亮的笛叫，它無情地擊破了我底遐想的泡影，催逼着我面對着嚴肅均現實……明天你回到祖國去吧，別要在這裏發癡呆！</p>
<p>島上明亮的光，在波濤洶湧中漸漸遠了，那些準備明天出海捕魚的帆船，在摘桅上正懸着一盞閃耀着的燈火呢！</p>

<p>有某影片公司，因爲開賭被控，昨在提審時，被告趙某供稱：「此次聚眾玩要，係應某慰勞曾之請，藉此籌欵賑濟難民」，所供是否實情，姑不具論。但開賭籌欵，究竟是一個不好的題目，這四個字連實在一起，實在有點不不倫類！</p>
<p>自然，開賭是違法的，而籌賑却是善舉。所以，兩仲事是絕對矛盾的，究竟爲了籌賑而開賭，是否法律所許可。那又是另外的一個問題了。不過，我們由這件事的啟示，可以知道不少人藉『籌賑』那個名目去發財的。</p>
<p>善於戈利的人，每會巧妙地利用不可多得的時機人抓住一倘動人的名目，大發其財，在這抗戰的過租中，產生了不少發國難財的凉血動物，而現在，又有人在發難民財了。</p>
<p>眞的，「籌賑」倘若可以用『開賭』去藝的話，將有更新的花樣，陸續演出，那是一定的，例如販毒籌眼，刦物籌賬……也不會是違法的吧？</p>
<p>話又說囘來了，我們對於熱心響應運動的人，是應予贊助的。但，我希望各人應爲籌眼而籌眼，不要爲發財而籌賑！同時，尤其是不要不擇手段的響賑。</p>
<h3>服務時代和環境</h3>
<p>— 陳適懷</p>
<p>現實是複雜和多方面的，而且也是嚴酷無情的。</p>
<p>的確，戰事把許多文藝工作者創作力睡生和激動起來了。在抗戰初期，不是有許多抱了一種前線主義見解的作家們，恨不能以鑰岸代替筆桿的嗎？誠然，他們不免有點浮躁。可是，在我們的文壇上有這麼一種稀有的現象，眞可算做一個大奇續哩。對于這次民埃解放戰爭，我們是作爲一個實踐者——不是旁觀者而參加進去的。我們生長在這個偉大的時代，又目擊到那些使人哭泣，使人鼓舞的英勇史蹟。我們的遭遇，可謂幸運之亞。從前鬧着『偉大作品爲什麼不能產生』的問題，現在總司以解次了吧，我想。擺在作家面前的，不是一大堆人類鬥爭史上最光榮最感人的血寫史詩嗎？我敢說現今的中國，該是產生像蘇聯的「鐵流」及『毀滅」一類的偉大作品的時代了。</p>
<p>高爾基說：『作爲一定的環境和時代的人的作家，不曾他的意忘和條件怎樣必須服務于他的時代和環境。一是的，我們的作家是應用筆米『發動民眾捍衛祖國』的。抗戰將士的如何央勇，與侵略者的如何卑劣，都可用我們的生花之筆描繪出來。問題是在于怎麼可避免為人所詬病的『公式化』，『唐俗化』，「口號式」，「實傳式」等吧了。只要你記得「文學是倘最嬪妬的醜歸」這句話，你就可以明白抱了一種盧榮心甚至子使倖心來從事文學工作的人，終必沒落。因此，「現實主羲的抗戰文學」遭個號召，似乎也並不是無意義的了。我們是這麼解釋的：『現實主義的主觀和客觀是統一着的。作家的世界觀和創作方法是不可分開的』。我們許多抱有正義感的作家，不論在前組或後方，都在運用着現實主義的創作方法了。我們續到許多作家在前線目擊的報台。不拘他們的形式，是通訊短間，民歌，或者是小調；只要那些是富有藝術性和形象化的作品。我們就司認爲是『現實主義的抗戰文學。』</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Seek Italy's Intentions: Main Discussions Will Focus on the Spanish War; Franco-Italian Relations Will Not Be Mediated for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Report from the 9th] When British Prime Minister Chamberlain travels to Rome tomorrow, he will carry a statement from the Spanish Republican government to discuss with the Italian authorities whether it is possible to change the Italian government's attitude toward the Spanish conflict. The statement contains two guarantees: (1) If the Spanish government forces are victorious, Spain will not become a communist state, but will continue to be a liberal parliamentary democracy; (2) The Spanish government will never adopt an anti-Italian policy. Although the Spanish people express resentment at Italy's interference in Spanish politics, if the Mediterranean agreement planned by the British government is successful, Spain will still be willing to sign the agreement with Italy.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] Yesterday, political circles cautiously pointed out that the visit of British cabinet members to Paris is entirely an expression of British friendship and has nothing to do with mediation in Rome. Rumors that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is prepared to reach a settlement with Mussolini can be dismissed as unfounded. Furthermore, it is said that given the current situation, if Italy does not stop the anti-French propaganda campaign in its newspapers, there will be no opportunity for negotiations between the two countries, let alone the possibility of reaching an understanding. Parisians generally believe that the current situation is entirely the responsibility of the Italian press. Even newspapers that usually advocate pro-Italian policies say that in the current situation, if the Italian press provokes disputes with France, even the most clever diplomats will find it difficult to mediate. The Rome conference will be purely for discussing Anglo-Italian affairs. People close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs say that the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary are coming to Paris entirely to discuss the Spanish issue. Since the Spanish rebels launched their offensive, the problem has become more serious, and there are concerns that undue foreign influence within the rebel camp will expand. French political circles have expressed that they would be pleased if Chamberlain could raise this issue at the meeting and obtain Italian guarantees to maintain the status quo in the western Mediterranean. At the same time, some say that the French government will request the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to raise the Spanish issue specifically when they go to Rome.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Send Message to Congress: Requesting to Strengthen the Army and Air Force; Number of Aircraft Must Be Quadrupled Next Year; New Air Force Bases to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] US President Roosevelt is scheduled to submit a defense message to Congress this week, the content of which is to request the strengthening of US defense capabilities, especially the air force. Well-informed sources predict that the President's message will state that Germany is superior to all other countries in terms of air power, and the United States cannot afford to lag behind. President Roosevelt's proposals will include: (1) The number of aircraft ordered by the Army and Navy next year must be increased fourfold; (2) 20,000 pilots and even more mechanics must be trained each year; (3) The number of Air Force personnel in the Army, currently 20,000, must be expanded to 60,000; (4) Infantry and artillery must be increased; (5) An additional £2,000 will be allocated to equip the US (first-line troops); (6) More munitions and educational supplies needed by the troops will be purchased; (7) New air force bases will be established. Government officials say that the President intends to propose that the number of Air Force personnel next year be increased by 5,000, with 2,000 for Army aviation personnel and 3,000 for Navy aviation personnel.</p>
<p>Relief Policies: Severely Criticized by Both Parties</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Roosevelt's relief policies are being severely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans today. This emergency relief bill will be reported to the Congressional Committee next week. The administration's proposal has now been submitted to a small organization committee for debate. The case will grant President Roosevelt $875 million for public works policies up to June 30 this year. The subcommittee will begin debating next week. New York Mayor LaGuardia will represent major cities in making demands. It is now very clear that the committee will specify the amount of funds, and some Democratic congressmen plan to propose amendments to prevent relief funds from being used for political purposes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] National Economic Executive Committee Chairman Angell issued a statement saying that the administration's continued wasteful policies will inevitably lead to unmanageable inflation. He said that Nanceford's budget is expected to reach 44 billion by 1940, which is enough to alarm millions of citizens concerned about taxes and the future value of gold dollars.</p>
<h3>Counter-offensive Progress of the Western Government Forces</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Barcelona, 8th] In the past three days, the Spanish government forces have suddenly launched a counter-offensive in the Estremadura region, advancing 25 miles westward. They have cleared out rebels in the Su Jia Shui area north of Fu Ante Obei Xiang Na, and occupied the intersection of the highways to the province of Badajos, Parari, and Darasi Zuo, only about 9,000 miles from the Portuguese border. Furthermore, the occupation of Fu Ante O Yuan In Na has cut off the highway and railway traffic of the rebels to the famous Ban Na Luo Ye mine, and the continuation of this injury is also half-encircled. The occupation of the two towns of Ge Lin Cha and Di Duo Li Xi Luo Sa in Badajos Province, and the four villages of La Gui Long Na Qu and Estremadura, is an important advance in the government forces' attack.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 8th] Today, various newspapers published a message about the alleged use of the Turkish government's name and forged signatures to purchase 50 aircraft from the United States and Canada for resale to the Spanish government. It is reported that a Turkish Foreign Ministry official was arrested in Ankara, and another Turkish official was detained in France.</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Congress to be Held Next Month</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 9th] It is announced here that the Fascist Party Administrative Congress will be held at 10:00 pm on February 4th at the Venice Palace. Furthermore, the recently established National Resources Self-Sufficiency Administrative Committee will meet at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Southern Prince Meets with Romanian King</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 8th] Prince Paul of Yugoslavia arrived in Trinsxi Wen Asia today to visit Romanian King Carol, who is vacationing there. Foreign diplomats believe that Carol and Paul are eager to exchange views in advance, given the imminent visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Yugoslavia. It is widely believed that Italy will act as a mediator or peacemaker between its allies (on the one hand, Hungary, and on the other hand, Yugoslavia and Romania) to prevent German advancement.</p>
<h3>Daladier Returns to Paris: People of the Territory Pledge Allegiance; He Expresses Great Satisfaction</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] French Prime Minister Daladier returned from North Africa yesterday afternoon and immediately reported to President Lebrun. According to the official gazette yesterday afternoon, President Lebrun expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Daladier for his service to France and its interests.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] Daladier issued a statement to the press, saying, "During my sea journey, I saw that the Tunisians and Algerians were extremely loyal to France, which was very gratifying. What I am even more satisfied with is their desire to see the French people unite to complete their current tasks."</p>
<h3>Palestine Border Closure: All External Traffic is Cut Off</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] The Palestine border has now been tightened. According to official announcements, all borders have been closed and external traffic has been temporarily suspended. When traffic can be restored will be announced later. According to military authorities, starting from January 12th, restrictions on the passage of non-Muslim and non-Jewish car drivers and passengers will be implemented. At the same time, Syria and Transjordan are not allowed to enter by car or horse-drawn carriage. The reason is that some people have used the previously issued permits to harm military security.</p>
<h3>No Results in Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Issue Negotiations: Red Army Newspaper Warns Japan; Soviet Rights Will Not Tolerate Infringement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 9th] Yesterday morning, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov resumed fisheries negotiations. The two sides argued for an hour and a half without reaching a conclusion. This was the eleventh negotiation between the two sides. The Red Star newspaper, the organ of the Soviet Red Army, recently commented on the Soviet-Japanese fisheries negotiations, saying that the Japanese government should know that the reason why the Japanese can fish in Soviet territorial waters is the result of the Soviet government's facilitation, not the strength of the Japanese government. In the last Zhanggufeng incident, the Japanese should know that the strength of the Red Army is completely different from that of the Tsarist Russian army. The Soviet Red Army has given the Japanese army a good lesson on the shores of Lake Hasan, because the Soviet people will never allow anyone to infringe on Soviet rights anywhere, etc. The tone of the newspaper is sufficient to represent the attitude of the Soviet government towards the fisheries issue.</p>
<h3>Hungary Issues an Ultimatum to Gabarso-Ukraine: Threatening to Cede the Basil Diocese; Constantly Provoking on the Czech Border</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 9th] It is reported that Hungarian Minister to Czechoslovakia Dr. Wilt Sheng has returned home. He will consult with the government before deciding whether to return to his post.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Czech Capital, 8th] It is reported that the Hungarian government has issued an ultimatum to the Gabarso-Ukraine government (translator's note: this state is an autonomous state in eastern Czech Republic), demanding that the latter's Basil Diocese be ceded to it. The deadline for responding to the ultimatum is the evening of the 9th, and military force will be used after the deadline.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Representatives of Hungary and Czech Republic negotiated all day yesterday on the Muka Sheva incident, and negotiations seem likely to continue today. The Czech representative has proposed a counterproposal to Hungary's proposal, advocating the establishment of a Hungarian territory in the western country.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Lou Capital, 8th] According to a semi-official message from the Ukrainian side, tonight the Hungarian mixed army crossed the border near Duhe and opened fire on the Czech border guards, resulting in a serious conflict near Engersuo. After firing at each other for thirty minutes at the front, the Hungarian army retreated from the Czech border. Czech envoy Lieutenant Novotny and Sergeant Hacha, with white cloths in their arms and white flags in their hands, went to Hungary, intending to meet with Hungarian officers to investigate the cause of the conflict. While traveling on the road to Duhe Village, the Hungarian army suddenly opened fire on them, and Hacha's chest was seriously injured. One bullet also pierced Novotny's clothes. In addition, several conflicts occurred on the border between Capasso, Ukraine and Hungary, but the nature was relatively less serious. According to Ukrainian reports, before these clashes occurred, the Hungarian army usually opened fire on the Czech border guards first.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 9th] The Hungarian official news agency recently published an account of the Czech-Hungarian border incident, saying that 200 Ukrainian terrorists first attacked the border of Naza Zhu, and the Hungarian guards immediately returned fire, repelling the attackers. The Hungarian border officer in charge started negotiations with the guards, but the Czech side still opened fire from time to time. There were no casualties on the Hungarian side.</p>
<p>Sudden Change in Attitude of German Newspapers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th] Regarding the repeated disputes on the Czech-Hungarian border, German political figures are still uneasy about the tendency of Czechs, especially Slovaks, to be their own masters. According to German sources, they are no longer adding green onions to the Slovaks. Recently, various newspapers have mostly reported that the Slovak Provincial Autonomous Government discriminates against Germans. The newspapers originally said that the Muka Xie Cheng incident should be the responsibility of Hungary, but now they have changed their tune and attributed the responsibility to the Czech government. Among them, the National Daily of Eisen City stated that the communist doctrine is still sliding within the Czech border. This situation is not in line with the spirit of reconciliation between Germany and the two countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 8th] The recent Hungarian-Hungarian border conflict has attracted the attention of Italian people, but the newspapers have not yet commented. Most of them are waiting for the report of the investigation committee.</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador to the Soviet Union to Depart for His Post Today</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 9th] Sir William Seeds, the Central Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will leave England for his post on Monday. The previous ambassador, Lord Joel Stondon, resigned due to his retirement age.</p>
<h3>Britain to Help Australia Expand Aircraft Production: Fact-Finding Mission to be Sent to Discuss and Draft Manufacturing Plans</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Official propaganda has recently stated that the British government, at the request of the Australian Federal Government, will send a fact-finding mission to Australia in the near future to jointly discuss the possibility of expanding Australian aircraft production and draft plans for consideration by both governments. The fact-finding mission includes Sir Lewa Dong, a member of the previous fact-finding mission to Canada, Bankes, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Air Ministry, and Sir Lang Moore, Air Force General, as well as experts. It is said that the purpose of the mission is to create a manufacturing plan similar to that of the Canadian factory, but the aircraft manufactured in Canada are to be supplied to the United Kingdom, while the manufacturing in Australia is to expand the local air force.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Members Discuss Far East Situation: Suggest Increasing Tariffs on Japanese Goods; US to Provide Currency Assistance to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] According to the Daily Mail's foreign affairs correspondent, before Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip to Rome, all cabinet members have today discussed the situation in the Far East. In the past few days, the government has considered using pressure to make Japan respect British interests and the open door in China. There have been many suggestions for oppressing Japan, which have been reviewed. Approximately, what is introduced to the Cabinet is to increase tariffs on Japanese goods and discriminate in favor of China. The United States is also reviewing this situation, and it is reported that it will also take helpful measure on currency for China, which is extremely harmful to Japan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] This agency's reporter visited an authority, who said that it is unbelievable that Britain intends to put pressure on Japan to force it to respect China's open door policy. In the past, Britain has considered how to protect its interests in China, especially the Yangtze River navigation, which is the most important. Although Britain and the United States can express the same trend, due to the complexity of all the many issues, the government must carefully consider each step before implementing it.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Hungary</h3>
<p>Dr. Eckhardt, an old Hungarian politician, was the leader of the Agricultural Party in the former Bethlan Cabinet. He was the most vocal anti-fascist and anti-Hitler figure in Hungary. He once said, "Under the conspiracy of National Socialist Party activities, Hungary will be National Socialistized and encounter the same fate as the loss of the country in 1526." At the same time, he warned the domestic National Socialist Party, saying, "The Hungarian people will never be sacrificed by the Nazi." However, the domestic National Socialist movement in Hungary not only did not disappear because of this, but instead fanned the flames and agitated within the country. What is particularly noteworthy is that in April of this year, there were rumors in the Hungarian region of Albert that it would be occupied by Hitler.</p>
<p>The current Prime Minister of Hungary, Yin Wright, is a soldier and an experienced businessman. He has received many medals for his contributions in the war. He believes that Hungary's weakness and decline make it vulnerable to plunder by foreign powers. At the same time, he believes that the reason why the domestic National Socialist Party dares to carry out activities openly is also due to the country's weak power. Therefore, as soon as he took office, he announced five new reconstruction plans: internally, developing national finance, actively opening state-owned factories, training laborers, ensuring stable agricultural and industrial life, reducing unemployment among domestic workers, and improving the lives of laborers; externally, expanding military preparations to enhance national prestige. Although his foreign policy remains friendly and cooperative with Germany, his attitude towards Germany is much tougher than that of previous cabinets. He is determined not to fascistize his country, so he also uses extremely strict methods to sanction and stop domestic Nazi movements.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Little Entente held in Yugoslavia in August of this year, Hungary was allowed to expand its military preparations. This cannot be regarded as a victorious harvest after Prime Minister Yin Wright took office. The reason why the Little Entente changed its previous attitude of opposing Hungary's revision of the treaty was of course because they saw the increasing power of the Berlin-Rome Axis in Europe recently. The Little Entente group itself was too busy to take care of itself and had no power to make things difficult for Hungary. However, on the other hand, it may not have been the result of the active communication of the Hungarian representatives with the Little Entente group.</p>
<p>However, we must know that the Hungarian authorities must not be satisfied with this. In today's Europe, which is full of the smell of gunpowder, preparation can defend against foreign aggression. Anti-fascists in Hungary, such as Eckhardt, mostly believe that relying solely on military preparations is not enough to save the country's crisis. Because in the border areas of Hungary, there are many poor farmers with arable land. They mostly live in semi-feudal poor rural areas, living in poverty. The National Socialist Party has used this weakness to provoke and agitate farmers to rebel against the government. Therefore, in these poverty areas, there are already several thousand people participating in the National Socialist movement. Dr. Eckhardt saw through this weakness. He believed that it was a domestic worry. He actively engaged in planning and advised the government to develop the border areas as soon as possible, so that farmers could live and work in peace, so that the schemes of the Nazi elements could not be implemented there. As a result, the Hungarian Congress passed Dr. Eckhardt's proposal and promulgated the Border Area Land Improvement Law. On September 4, Yin Lingte delivered an important speech in Caposvar on the implementation plan of the Land Improvement Law, stating that the plan is limited to be completed within seven years, and an average of 100,000 acres of good land can be reclaimed each year for poor farmers to cultivate. In addition, it also indicated that the government is willing to lend money to farmers as a farming fund. Due to the establishment of this kind of land improvement law, we can imagine that the anti-fascist faction has a great power in Hungary. Dr. Eckhardt also subsequently issued a statement saying, "Now Hungary's internal affairs have gradually reformed and moved forward. Although many policies are often subject to the conspiracies of reactionary elements during implementation, which causes obstacles, we will never be discouraged because of this. We believe that in the near future, there will always be more free and innovative political, economic, and diplomatic systems than the present."</p>
<p>The implementation of this land improvement law fully demonstrates that the Hungarian government has gradually turned to the anti-fascist faction. At the same time, this plan is completely aimed at the Nazi followers in Hungary. Naturally, the fascist bandits in Hungary will never want it to develop smoothly. They are also planning various conspiracies and evil schemes to stop and destroy this plan. According to the latest information I have received, the little followers and lackeys under Hitler's command have been lobbying in the border area, using the bait of allowing the immediate distribution of good land to farmers to instigate them to oppose the government and participate in their Nazi organization. Major General Chai Lai Su, one of the important leaders of the Nazi organization in Hungary, was recently arrested by the government for participating in this activity and sentenced to three years in prison. However, this kind of conspiracy will never be stopped because of this. Other fascist leaders are still continuing to carry out activities. Now, the Sderfen County in the border area of Hungary has been completely fascistized by the Nazi Party's activities. All politics and economy are also completely manipulated by the Nazi Party. Can the Hungarian authorities implement this land improvement as soon as possible to defeat the conspiracy of the broken society? I am very worried about this township issue for Hungary.</p>
<p>Since the Mingyi Conference resolved the Czech incident, the diplomacy between Germany and Hungary has also changed from its previous friendly attitude. Before the Mingxing Conference was held, Hungary had always catered to Germany and acted as Hitler's accomplice. She wanted to take advantage of the fire to rob and divide Louke's territory. Therefore, the authorities had visited Germany several times, and Hitler had expressed his support for the recovery of the lost territory within the territory. However, after the Ming and Congresses, Coke instead shook hands with Germany and asked Hitler to help curb resistance to Hungary. At the same time, Germany actually opposed Hungary's request to cede Chusennia to connect with Poland's territory, which made Hungary's attitude towards Germany had to turn around and change its consistent pro-German policy. In the past, Hungary advocated a Polish-Hungarian union to jointly defend the Union. But now, she is shouting high to organize the Polish-Hungarian axis to prevent Hitler from taking Romania's oil fields and Ukraine's agricultural products.</p>
<p>The reason why Hitler did not agree to give the Dillonian of Luxembourg to Hungary is partly because of his ambition to cover up and take over Ukraine, but the biggest reason is because he also has aggressive intentions towards Luxembourg. We know that there are a million Polish and Soviet minorities living in Chisenia province. Hitler can deploy war society forces there, and then use various conspiracies to make these people embrace his aspirations and serve as the base for the activities of the Nazi Party in this area, making it easier for him to realize his ambition to invade Greater Ukraine. If Luxembourg is occupied by Hungary, Hitler's invasion plan will become a castle in the air, which can be hoped for but cannot be obtained. Although Luxembourg is a mountainous lowland and its culture is not advanced, from Hitler's point of view, which is based on aggression, Luxembourg is a strategically important area. On November 2nd of this year, after the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy arbitrated the dispute between Hungary and Hungary, although Hungary obtained two important towns from Anke, the forest in the area was never returned to Hungary, and Hitler's ambition can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Now Hitler's followers are more active in Hungary, and some people in the country are deeply infected with the essential elements of the National Socialist Party. The German nation of Apad is also arousing ethnic emotions and rising up in rebellion, demanding to return to their homeland. In short, in today's Hitler's attempt to advance eastward, Hungary is regarded as an obstacle that must be removed, because it is one of the transportation hubs for attacking Ukraine and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Hungary's agricultural products and livestock are also being targeted by Hitler. However, one point should not be overlooked, that is, the anti-fascist faction in Hungary, under the leadership of Dr. Eckhardt, is also carrying out major activities. They have long known the poisonous tricks of the Fascist Party, so they are fully prepared and determined to be patriots to the end.</p>

<p>Brief comment</p>
<h3>The Honor of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</h3>
<p>There is a noteworthy piece of news in today's Hong Kong news section. According to confirmed reports from the Philippines, since the full-scale War of Resistance began, the donations from our overseas Chinese in the Philippines to support the motherland's war effort have exceeded 19 million, averaging over one hundred yuan donated by each overseas Chinese in the Philippines for the motherland's struggle for independence, freedom, and happiness. While this number may not be considered astounding, when compared to past achievements in Hong Kong, it cannot help but evoke the feeling that "the future surpasses the past by far." Furthermore, an examination of the living conditions of overseas Chinese in both places cannot help but create a different kind of feeling.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, especially those in the middle and lower-middle class, and the so-called "laboring masses" such as hawkers, have been ardent and sincere in contributing money and effort to the motherland in the past, truly moving people to tears. However, it is undeniable that many overseas Chinese have not consistently and enthusiastically donated to the country. We hope that everyone will look at the honor of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines today, become inspired, and engage in a glorious competition. This will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the early realization of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The current enthusiasm of all sectors for the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement may perhaps prevent disappointing people at home and abroad again!</p>
<h3>Stop the Japanese Army's Offensive!</h3>
<p>During the German army's offensive on Verdun in the European War, the French army naturally adopted the slogan, "They shall not pass!" It became like a command in the war, uniting everyone, and finally defeating the German army.</p>
<p>"Stop the Japanese army's offensive!" This is the urgent task currently inspiring our War of Resistance! It can also be used as a command circulating among our entire nation.</p>
<p>According to the 士幾西報, "Since the Sino-Japanese War began, it has recently reached the most surprising stage. Apart from the Japanese navy's bombing of our ships, the Japanese army has apparently completely stopped its offensive. Nanchang and Changsha, two important towns, were initially believed to be in Japanese hands before the end of the twenty-seventh year, but up to this day, the security of these two important towns remains the same as before the fall of Wuhan." From this, it can be seen that the statement "the Japanese army's difficulties are becoming increasingly serious, and our army is becoming stronger as it fights" is definitely not just an optimistic view of a few people, but an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>Of course, if we assume that the general lull in the war means that the Japanese army has no offensive power, it is clearly a mistake, because the Japanese army still has the possibility of exhausting all its resources in a desperate gamble. However, if our front-line combat strength can be increasingly strengthened, the battle groups behind enemy lines can be increasingly developed, the preparations for a counter-offensive in the rear can be actively completed, national politics can be accelerated, and the people can intensify their efforts to transport supplies and manpower to support the front lines, then not only can the war situation continue to stabilize, but the Japanese army will also ultimately be unable to launch or advance its "final offensive" until we finally drive the Japanese out of China.</p>
<p>The situation is becoming more favorable to us day by day. Everyone must redouble their excitement and redouble their efforts, sparing no sacrifice, to realize "Stop the Japanese army's offensive!"</p>

<h3>Our Guangdong Army Advances on All Fronts, Shilong and Shitan Can Be Recovered Soon, Japanese Plan to Retreat to Dongguan and Humen</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] Wu Qihui, Xia Wei, and Yu Hanmou's troops are encircling Guangzhou from the east, west, and north in part, while Li Hanhun's troops are also operating from the north in coordination. The Japanese in Guangzhou, Sanshui, Jiujiang, and Dongguan are extremely fearful, all shortening their lines in an attempt to resist stubbornly. At the same time, they plan to abandon Shilong and Shitan in order to concentrate their forces in Dongguan and Humen to guard the gateway to the Pearl River. Finally, when necessary, they will abandon the Dapeng Bay area and rely on naval power to preserve Guangzhou's sea route. Since Wang Jingwei's peace movement failed, the Japanese army in South China seems to have temporarily abandoned its attempt to invade Guangxi Province from the West River or land at Beihai.</p>
<p>[External Telegram, Shenzhen, Evening of the 9th] It is reported that Chinese troops coming from Huizhou have arrived in the outskirts of Shilong and are engaged in battles with Japanese forward units. The Chinese army has now recovered several small towns east of Shilong.</p>
<p>[Reuters, National Gate, 9th] Several Japanese planes bombed Shizhi with six bombs this morning, completely destroying the power plant.</p>
<p>Xue Yue Discusses the Situation in the Hunan-Jiangxi Theater</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Changsha, 9th] Xue Yue, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth War Area, told reporters: It is doubtful whether the Japanese can launch a large-scale offensive along the river in the Wuhan area. He believes that the Japanese will concentrate in the southwest and northwest to invade Guangxi and Shaanxi provinces because: (1) The Mufu Mountains lie between the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border regions, acting as a natural barrier. We have built strong fortifications along the mountains. To the east is Poyang Lake, and to the west is Dongting Lake. The water levels of both lakes are low in winter, making it impossible for Japanese warships to operate. Moreover, there is only one highway and one railway between Wuchang and Changsha, and only one highway and one railway between Jiujiang and Nanchang. (2) The Xinxiang River and Miluo River flow westward into Dongting Lake, while the Xiu River and Gan River flow eastward into Poyang Lake—creating a natural defense line for Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. (3) The Mufu Mountains are undulating and densely forested, which the Japanese regard as a difficult path. (4) It is estimated that the Japanese would need to increase their forces by four divisions to break through our Mufu Mountains defenses. Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue finally made an important suggestion: In the future, we should advance our military, political, and economic forces eastward to engage in a comprehensive struggle with the Japanese, not just build up the western provinces. In the process of advancing eastward, the tasks of nation-building and the long-term War of Resistance can be smoothly completed.</p>
<p>[External Telegram, Shanghai, 9th] According to sources in Longtong, Yamada, the commander of the Japanese army in Central China, will soon order a large-scale offensive on Changsha.</p>
<p>[External Telegram, Chongqing, 9th] The Sino-Japanese war has now reached the most unusual stage. Apart from sporadic small conflicts, the offensive has been almost completely abandoned. It was generally predicted that the Changsha and Nanchang areas would fall before the end of last year, but now they are as safe as they were before the fall of Hankou. Except for the Chinese guerrillas attacking the Japanese army, there is hardly any war. The fiercest battle yesterday took place near Qiujin, southwest of De'an. Also yesterday, the Japanese army in the Xiushui area was about to hold a review when they were fiercely shelled by the Chinese army across the river. The review could not be completed, and the Japanese army soon returned fire. This continued for two hours until the shelling stopped. The Japanese army in Jining and Fanxian along the Yellow River is on high alert and is forcing civilians to dig three trenches at several strategic points along the river, each protected by barbed wire. Jinli, a small town west of Sanshui in Guangdong, was heavily shelled by the Japanese army yesterday, but the Chinese army positions suffered little damage. Also yesterday, Japanese planes were active only in Hubei and Hunan provinces. Hengyang was subjected to heavy bombing, killing nine civilians. Ten Japanese planes attacked Xiangyang five times.</p>
<h3>We Wipe Out Fenglingdu, Fierce Fighting on the Northeast Bank of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 8th] (1) The Japanese in the Qinghua, Yongji, and Hanyang areas have been repeatedly attacked by Li Tuan and Zhang Guo, disrupting their transportation. They are very frightened and have made strict deployments in Huangjiajiao, Fengboguzhen, and other places to prevent our attacks. On the afternoon of the 6th, a part of our local brigade advanced towards the Liuguan Village area of Hanyang Town and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese for four hours. Our artillery on the right bank simultaneously fired to assist in the battle, killing forty or fifty Japanese infantrymen, seven artillerymen, and destroying one artillery piece. The remaining Japanese immediately moved northwest of the village. We sent the main forces of the Wang and Yang brigades to capture Dongzhuang and wipe out Fenglingdu. Fierce battles are expected to unfold within days. (2) Tu Huting, the puppet magistrate of Yongji, had been in office for less than a month.

<h3>After the Fifth Plenary Session, There Are Personnel Changes in the Central Government, The Session Dates of the National Political Council Are Undecided</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th] In order to enhance our strength and fight a long-term war, there will be some personnel changes in the central government after the Fifth Plenary Session on the 20th. The call for Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, to serve as Deputy Director-General is very high, but a decision must be made after the Fifth Plenary Session has added. However, it is rumored in official circles that Sun will be transferred to the position of President of the Executive Yuan, and Chen Cheng will serve as Minister of Military Administration. The above statements cannot be confirmed, but because the party continues to value the spirit of loyalty, the transfer of personnel in the Central Party Department is inevitable. The National Political Council was originally scheduled to convene once in March, but now, due to Wang's departure, the session dates are undecided. The speaker's seat will be announced after the meeting is convened.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River is Treacherous, Foreign Ships Downstream Must Fly False Flags, Foreign Ships Robbed Outside the Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 9th] It has been learned that the Japanese authorities in various parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have ordered that foreign ships will not be allowed to proceed unless they fly the Japanese flag and the Five-Colored Flag.

<h3>Japanese Threaten the Tianjin Concessions, Openly Making Demands</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 9th] A spokesman for the Japanese special military office today publicly stated for the first time that the Japanese side strongly desires the Tianjin concession authorities to reorganize the police force in order to deal with the Japanese riots. In view of the current situation, the spokesman stated that the Japanese side will take more severe methods than those of December 12 last year, especially for Chinese transport, which is already severe but is still considered tolerant. It is necessary to take more severe measures. Due to the Japanese unification of vehicles, the number of Chinese vehicles going to the concessions has decreased by 20 to 30 percent, but foreigners believe that the Japanese side no longer prohibits food from entering the concessions. There are also few encounters between foreigners and the Japanese. These encounters often occur when soldiers from the British, French, and American forces take shortcuts back to camp at night, passing through Japanese territory and causing misunderstandings. However, they can be resolved, such as the conflict between the Japanese and Americans and the detention of the British. They are all resolved immediately. When foreigners asked the Japanese spokesman whether the Japanese side would deal with the situation again if the attitude of the concession authorities remained unchanged, the Japanese spokesman asked that the concession authorities reorganize the police force and take other necessary reforms in order to eliminate all troublemakers. Otherwise, they will take appropriate measures to deal with the situation. When asked about the nature of these measures, the Japanese spokesman replied that the Japanese side would not take inhumane methods such as preventing food from entering the concessions, but the Japanese side cannot predict what actions will be taken.</p>
<h3>Liyang Recovered, Our Guerrillas Increase in the Suburbs of Shanghai, The Japanese "Mopping-Up" Plan Fails</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Shanghai News: The guerrillas in the Jingqian area have established close ties with each other and are actively operating, having recovered Shenyang. The Japanese have repeatedly gathered troops from Jurong, Yixing, and other places to attack, but they have all been fiercely resisted and have failed to succeed. Currently, the Shen-Ju highway has been completely destroyed by the guerrillas, who are also operating in the Jurong-Nanjing highway area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai News: Recently, for two months, the Japanese army has been mobilizing large forces in the western suburbs of Shanghai and in the Pudong and Puxi areas to carry out the so-called plan to mop up the Chinese guerrillas. The plan has now failed because the Japanese army cannot clear them out. When the Japanese army leaves, the guerrillas immediately return to their original defenses. The strength of the western suburbs of Shanghai has increased. The troops of Ding Xishan in Punan have even secretly crossed the river and entered the Qinghu Highway area. Currently, fighting has broken out again near Guanyintang on the Qinghu Highway. Japanese vehicles are now taking cover, and only a few small-caliber warships are patrolling the Huangpu River on alert.</p>
<p>Our Army in Northern Jiangsu Fights Bravely in the Snow</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 7th] Lianyungang has recently been experiencing continuous snow and rain, and the climate is severely cold. The mountain-ringed, sea-encircled war zone is swept by piercing north winds, yet our army continues to defend its positions in the ice and snow, and frequently launches surprise attacks. The Japanese stationed in Qishi, fearing our night attacks, burned down all the civilian houses in Qingzhuang to clear the line of fire. They attacked Daban jump, Climbing Hill Head, and other places, but were bravely repulsed by our forces. The Japanese also conscripted civilians to build aircraft in the port using coal as an air force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 7th] On the evening of the 1st, our army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese camp in the East Gate of Suyu during the Japanese celebration of New Year's Day, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers and then safely returning to its original defenses.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Meets with Sichuan Military and Political Leaders, Instructs on Military Reorganization and Development Opportunities, Wang Zanxu is Steadfast in his Confidence in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Yesterday, Sunday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with Deng Xihou and Wang Zanxu to discuss the reorganization of the Sichuan army. Today and tomorrow, they will discuss the progress of development in the southwestern provinces. According to external observations, after Wang Jingwei left Chongqing, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the National Government have gained greater support from the people, greatly increasing the strength of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Headquarters, Chongqing, 9th] Sichuan Chairman Wang Huanxu came to Chongqing to report on his work. According to him, "I have already made full preparations for a full-scale war with the Japanese. The Japanese can only occupy transportation lines and big cities, while we have a vast area beyond the points and lines. Our guerrillas make it impossible for the Japanese to advance further. The military operations of counterattacking Guangdong and Wuhan have already been arranged. Conghua, Huiyang, and Zengcheng will definitely be recovered. I have a strong division of troops stationed along the Yellow River. The Japanese are currently talking about attacking Lanzhou and Xi'an, which is just a pipe dream."</p>
<h3>Rumors that Wang Jingwei Met with Japanese Representatives in Hanoi, The Ugly Crowd in Nanjing Opposes Wang Serving as a Puppet, Wang Feels Distressed and Regretful</h3>
<p>[Rapid Telegram from This Newspaper, Hanoi, 9th] According to informed sources, Wang Jingwei is still in Hanoi, residing at Zhu Peide's residence. Today, he and Zeng Zhongming had their first important meeting with representatives from the Japanese side at Zhu's residence. The details of the talks are unknown. His wife, Chen Bijun, has arrived in Hong Kong. It is generally predicted that Wang will also go to Hong Kong soon. Wang's spokesman categorically denied that Wang had gone to Shanghai to participate in the Nanjing puppet organization.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] According to opinions in political circles here, Wang Jingwei has remained silent since resigning from the near cabinet. Furthermore, news has been obtained here that Wang had been in contact with the Chinese ugly crowd in Beiping before leaving the country, but had not contacted Liang Hongzhi and other rebels in Nanjing. As a result, the Liang rebels and others strongly opposed him becoming the president of a puppet central government. Japanese intelligence agencies urged Wang to organize a puppet government in Guangzhou, which Wang opposed. Therefore, Wang is extremely distressed and in a dilemma. Wang's whereabouts remain a mystery, and the news is conflicting. Some say Wang is in Hong Kong, others say Wang has left Hong Kong and gone to Shanghai to hide in the Hongkou area of Shanghai. As a result, the Japanese military police have imposed martial law in Hongkou. According to reliable sources, Wang is still in a villa six miles outside of Hanoi. Other news claims that Wang will go to the West soon and then to Europe because Wang is now disappointed and has encountered some difficulties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 9th] Political parties here are not criticizing Zhuang Jingwei's "suggestions." The declarations issued by the Central Propaganda and Political Departments have clearly expressed their opinions, so it is not yet known whether the official criticism will be issued.</p>

<h3>The Collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and Prospects for the Hiranuma Cabinet (Continued from Yesterday's Seventh Page)</h3>
<p>— Li Wanju</p>
<p>Prospects for the New Cabinet</p>
<p>Kiichirō Hiranuma is one of the leaders of the fascist movement. This time, taking office as prime minister, his style is certainly not much different from Konoe's. However, his reckless actions will inevitably "go further." His future actions are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>1.  Reorganizing the National Organization Movement. Although Japan is a country that reads martial arts and loves war, its people, who are relatively clear-headed, know that this invasion of our country is unjustified. Moreover, after the outbreak of the war, the large number of people mobilized, except for the ashes of the dead who were sent back, were never to return. The people fell from depression into pessimism, and their morale declined day by day, causing panic among Japanese party and government officials who did not know what to do. The arrogance of these warlords reached the point of helplessness. After the reorganization of the Konoe Cabinet in late May last year, with Araki joining, the so-called "National Reorganization" movement was accelerated in the hope of revitalizing the decadent spirit of the people. Now, one of the three giants of the National Reorganization movement, Kido, has taken the post of Home Minister, and the spiritual movement has been brought up again and actively promoted. This is naturally a matter of intention. As for the content, there will also be significant changes, but the extent of the changes is still unpredictable.</p>
<p>2.  Unlimited Spending on War Expenses. The amount of money Japan has spent in the year and a half of the war is not only unimaginable to the Japanese themselves but also beyond the expectations of people around the world. From July 7 to the end of last year, in addition to the consumption of most of the military supplies prepared by Japan in previous years, war expenses alone reached 8.4 billion yuan. Since the Sino-Japanese War could not be "resolved quickly" as envisioned by the Japanese military, no one dares or can determine when the war will end given the current situation. As the war is prolonged, war expenses will naturally have to be spent continuously, but how to raise funds has become a problem. Issuing huge amounts of public debt? Judging from past experience, Japan's stomach is not healthy, and its digestive capacity is very limited. Borrowing from abroad? During the year-long war, the Japanese military's bombing and killing in China, exclusion of foreign businesses, and restriction of foreign activities, in an attempt to dominate East Asia, have been deeply grieved by kind people all over the world. Recently, the attitude of British public opinion and even political circles has gradually become tougher, and large-scale foreign investment has become "impossible," without a doubt. The Japanese warlords, in a desperate situation, will force their government to implement the National Mobilization Law to allow for unlimited spending on industry expenses. If this is the case, entrepreneurs' investments and financial groups will inevitably stop moving forward, and the result for the war economy will inevitably be a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>3.  Domestic Affairs and Diplomacy. Hiranuma, as a leader of the fascist period, has always advocated the reform movement most vigorously. After the February 26th Incident, he became the chairman of the Privy Council. Due to his position as a senior official, all his actions were naturally cautious. He slightly concealed his edge for a while, but his original intention has not changed. Now that he has become prime minister, the so-called "administrative reform" is bound to be implemented. The results of its implementation will not only fail to clean up the domestic affairs but will also make them more chaotic. How it develops will soon be presented before our eyes. However, although Mikumo and other warlords strongly advocate dissolving the Diet, Hiranuma, for the sake of caution, is expected to temporarily find ways to avoid it. In terms of diplomacy, anti-British and anti-Soviet policies have always been the consistent policy of Japanese fascists. As for appeasing the United States, because the United States' policy is becoming increasingly tough, President Roosevelt, in his address to the 76th Congress on the 4th of this month, attacked dictatorial countries, using very strong language, and even advocated that democratic countries should unite to give aggressors severe sanctions. Therefore, the diplomatic policy towards the United States seems to have reached a dead end. As for diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, they will inevitably become more active. On the 5th of this month, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Ōshima held important talks in San Remo, Italy, and will also hold talks with their diplomatic personnel stationed in various European countries. From this, we can know that after Hiranuma takes office, Japan, no matter how it conceals its fascistization, will further establish close relations with Germany and Italy, which share similar interests. It is certain that it will strengthen the anti-Communist agreement and promote the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. (End of Collection)</p>
<h3>A Suggestion: Guilin Cave Education</h3>
<p>— Tao Xingzhi</p>
<p>(I) Based on Several Facts</p>
<p>A. Guilin caves are famous all over the world. These caves are not only natural trenches but also natural public school buildings.</p>
<p>B. When the air raid alarm sounded on November 30, the common people went to these caves to avoid the air raid. The place I went to is called Zhiyan Rock. The common people gathered in three relatively large caves in huge numbers. I heard that there are more than a hundred such places in Guilin. I don't know if this is correct. Since several major bombings, the people's enthusiasm for entering the caves to take shelter must have increased.</p>
<p>C. When we are waiting for the emergency alarm to sound, we have half an hour to do nothing. After the bombing, the planes left, and we waited for a long time before the alarm was lifted. During this time, the common people have nothing to do.</p>
<p>D. I was originally giving a speech at the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement. Halfway through, I received an alarm and had to accompany the executive members of the association to Zhiyan Rock to continue the speech. The common people also felt interested and listened casually.</p>
<p>E. On the way to Zhiyan Rock, I saw several things that deserve attention and seem to need education to help solve: (1) There is no order in walking; (2) Many women are carrying one child and carrying another, and no one is helping. In narrow roads and cave entrances, children are in danger of being knocked down and trampled.</p>
<p>F. When there is no air raid alarm, the common people also go to the caves to take shelter until two or three o'clock before returning home, but the number is smaller.</p>
<p>G. It is estimated that there are 10,000 intellectuals in Guilin from both local and other provinces, and 1,000 to 2,000 people can be mobilized to engage in popular education to serve the common people. Wounded and recovered officers and soldiers can be selected to give speeches on heroic war stories.</p>
<p>(II) Propose Several Measures</p>
<p>A. Each large cave should be a wartime public school, and each small cave it contains should be a classroom. Educational arrangements and management should be made inside and outside the cave.</p>
<p>B. Organize the Guilin Wartime Popular Education Corps</p>
<p>1.  Organize education corps according to the number of caves. Each large cave should have a popular education corps responsible for it.</p>
<p>2.  Solicit voluntary corps members.</p>
<p>A. Social organizations, government agencies, or schools that have the strength to independently organize a corps may establish a corps with the approval of the government, called a certain organization, agency, or school education corps, responsible for managing a large cave.</p>
<p>B. Individual voluntary corps members will be assigned to a certain corps for service by the government based on their address and proximity. Or they will be organized into one or several corps.</p>
<p>C. Corps members are purely voluntary.</p>
<p>3.  Each corps should have one corps leader, one deputy corps leader, and several branch corps leaders, who will be elected by each corps.</p>
<p>4.  Each corps may provide progressive teaching by teachers according to the needs of children, women, and young people.</p>
<p>C. Content of Cave Education</p>
<p>1.  First Grade - General Education Content Assembly:</p>
<p>(A) Military and political reports (national, provincial, Japanese), focusing on recent news and analysis;</p>
<p>(B) War stories;</p>
<p>(C) Air raid common sense;</p>
<p>(D) Teaching songs;</p>
<p>(E) Scientific common sense - including public health and increasing production;</p>
<p>(F) Preliminary civil rights and group life;</p>
<p>(G) Literacy training, starting from recognizing slogans;</p>
<p>(H) Children's games.</p>
<p>2.  Two lessons each time (air raid), half an hour each.</p>
<p>3.  Course materials should be prepared and instructed in general terms, experimented with, and revised.</p>
<p>D. Training of Popular Education Corps Members</p>
<p>1.  Preliminary centralized training for one week, two hours a day.</p>
<p>2.  After that, centralized training once or twice a week.</p>
<p>3.  Corps member training, based on general education content and the special needs of women, children, and young people.</p>
<p>4.  Establish demonstration areas, rotate to various caves to provide key guidance, so that the wisdom and education corps of each cave can learn better methods in practice.</p>
<p>E. Experimentation. Before general promotion, child drama troupes, the New Peace Travel Circle, the International Anti-Aggression Movement China Branch, and local organizations with rich experience in popular education may be selected to conduct experiments in a large cave, exchange results, and help solicit corps members during the experiment to facilitate the government's expansion of organization.</p>
<p>F. Organize a guidance committee, and the government will hire experts to be responsible for training corps members.</p>
<p>G. Organize an editing committee to produce materials for each corps to use.</p>
<p>H. Equipment. The minimum equipment is a map of China, a map of the world, and slogans that can be changed at any time. It is good to have a film projector, a radio, children's toys, and a simple medicine box, but it can be postponed if not.</p>
<p>I. Possible Achievements. The common people have ready-made time, intellectuals have ready-made contributions, and nature gives us ready-made classrooms. I think all three beauties are embodied. One thousand yuan can provide preliminary education to one hundred thousand or even two hundred thousand people, and the election can be extended to the same environment.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fifth Plenary Session under the New Situation</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee is now scheduled to be held within the month. As the national resistance war enters a new stage and the domestic and international situation is completely new, this plenary session has very important significance for the future of the Chinese nation and the future of world peace, and will have very important influence. We cannot but give it ardent support and close attention.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang is the largest political party leading the Chinese nation's resistance war and nation-building today, and it is also the party leading the country with one-sixth of the world's population to fight for independence, freedom, and happiness. This party has a glorious and great revolutionary history. Since the full-scale resistance war began, its prestige among the people of the country and international figures has been increasing day by day. However, it is undeniable that there are still many obstacles to the future of this party. Wang Jingwei's betrayal and the alienation and division of the Chinese people are reflections of shortcomings and obstacles. For the sake of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the future of world peace, we must strive for the Kuomintang to be more united, healthier, more advanced, and more revolutionary. The first task of this Fifth Plenary Session is to achieve this goal. Especially since Wang Jingwei's betrayal, on the one hand, a more united, healthier, more advanced, and more revolutionary future has been opened up before the Kuomintang. On the other hand, it has encountered the wanton alienation, slander, and destruction of national traitors, Chinese traitors, and corrupt elements within the party. Therefore, we hope that the Fifth Plenary Session will pay special attention to this, smash the traitors' conspiracy, improve the party's organization and discipline, and strive for a bright future. We hope that the Central Committee members currently abroad will rush back to Chongqing as much as possible to actively participate in the plenary session, while the Central Committee members who are usually close to Wang should take this opportunity to fulfill their loyalty to the party, clearly express their support for the central government, oppose division, and correct the views of China and foreign countries and break the poison of traitors!</p>
<p>The main condition for the Chinese nation to achieve victory is the unity of the entire nation, that is, the consolidation and expansion of the anti-Japanese united front. The reason why the Kuomintang's prestige has increased in the eighteen months of the resistance war lies in the fact that the party leaders are good at uniting people from all parties and factions and non-party people and implementing the national united front policy. However, the human traitors and national scum are doing everything possible to alienate and destroy it. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the same in the future. We admire the Kuomintang leaders for being able to overcome all obstacles in the past, but in order to thoroughly prevent and eliminate future obstacles, we should now determine the method of consolidating and developing long-term national unity, establish a national alliance for resistance and nation-building, and unite all parties, factions, ethnic groups, and sectors under the unified leadership of the Kuomintang for a long time, and work together to complete the sacred task of resistance and nation-building. News has come that the Fifth Plenary Session will seriously consider and implement the establishment of a long-term cooperation method proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China last year. This is good news for the people of the country, because this consideration can forever smash the traitors' conspiracy to provoke alienation and open up a bright and victorious future for the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The progress of the political system and the improvement of political institutions are the basic conditions for ensuring the victory of the resistance war and the success of nation-building. This is the unanimous public opinion of the country since the full-scale resistance war began, and it is also the national policy that our central government has been seeking to realize day and night. However, in the past, due to regional or personnel relations, the central government's perfect policies and laws have achieved absolutely opposite results. This phenomenon is usually enough to hinder the implementation of the central government's policies and hinder the mutual trust and sincere cooperation between the government and the people, but during the period of resistance and nation-building, its impact is even more unthinkable! Recently, the Political Department of the Military Commission published an article "Discussion and Resolution on the Future Work of the Political Department," which stated that the Political Department has made very progressive resolutions on the political work in the new stage based on the bloody experience and lessons learned in the resistance war for a year and a half, which specifically pointed out that "politics is more important than military affairs." This is one example. How to actively support and develop public opinion organs, promote wartime democratic politics, implement necessary people's livelihood improvements, and eliminate corruption and local bullies and reform the Baojia system, etc., are all prerequisites for accelerating the concentration of national power to promote the work of resistance and nation-building and reaching the road to victory, and should also be the main topics of this plenary session.</p>
<p>At present, the resistance war has entered the second strategic phase of full-scale guerrilla counter-offensive from the strategic defensive phase of consuming enemy forces. The main task of this period is how to stop the enemy's offensive, how to widely launch and complete the new forces for counter-offensive preparations, so as to smoothly enter the third strategic phase and achieve the goal of expelling Japanese forces from China and establishing an independent, free, and happy new China. In order to faithfully implement and complete the major tasks of this period, we must redouble our efforts to enhance the combat effectiveness of the front-line troops, redouble our efforts to enhance and develop combat in the war zone and behind enemy lines, redouble our efforts to establish, consolidate, and expand anti-Japanese democratic power in the occupied areas, and redouble our efforts to develop military, industrial, transportation, construction, and production undertakings in the rear in a wider and more vigorous manner. Some of these requirements have been implemented, and some are being planned, but in order to achieve them quickly, effectively, and universally, this Fifth Plenary Session should further determine specific methods.</p>
<p>In addition, such as the implementation of new financial and economic policies, the universal implementation of comprehensive education for the resistance war, the wider and larger absorption of national youth into the Three People's Principles Youth League, improving the organization and development work, unifying and improving the public mobilization mechanism, and improving the diplomatic policy and its mechanism adjustment and enrichment, under the current new situation, we must also strive to realize them by means of a blitz. Regarding these issues, we have detailed our views in the New Year's message this year. We dare to submit them again to the Fifth Plenary Session as a humble offering, hoping that the members of the Central Committee will use them as reference materials.</p>
<h3>Deputy Commander Xiang Ying Talks About the Current Situation of the New Fourth Army: All 20,000 People Belong to Four Detachments; More Than 2,000 Casualties in Six Months of Fighting</h3>
<p>[Reported from Shanghai by Our Newspaper] A foreign reporter sent a communication from the headquarters of the New Fourth Army south of Wuhu, describing the current situation of the army in great detail. He said that the area along the Yangtze River, from Nanxuan in the east to Anqing in the west and reaching the mountains, lakes, and rivers in the north and south, is where the New Fourth Army is active. At dusk and dawn, they suddenly attacked Japanese garrisons, sniped transport ships, overturned trucks, captured Japanese prisoners and returned to headquarters, and exploded Japanese storage areas, demolished bridges, and destroyed highways day after day, harassing Japanese sentries and occasionally attacking assembled regular Japanese troops. The New Fourth Army has about 20,000 people, divided into four detachments, two-thirds of whom are former Red Army soldiers, but they did not participate in the "Long March." At that time, they stayed in the rear, serving as conscripts to protect the Soviet area in preparation for the Anti-Japanese War. In 1934, when Zhu De and Mao Zedong led the main force of the Red Army on the Long March, a large number of Red Army troops led by Xiang Ying were also left behind to contain the attacks of the Central Army, and then they dispersed to various places. Xiang Ying is now the deputy commander of the New Fourth Army. According to reports, for the past three years, most of the Red Army has been living in the mountains, sleeping on the ground, often traveling more than a hundred miles a night, and carrying food for three days. Without the people, the Red Army would never be able to exist. When trapped, they relied on farmers and villagers to provide food and relied on their leadership to break through the encirclement. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the remnants of the Red Army in South China called on the government to transfer them to the front line to resist Japan. With the government's consent, in September, Xiang Ying went to Nanchang and held talks with He Yingqin, the representative of the Ministry of Military Affairs. In October, the Military Commission agreed to incorporate the former Red Army into the National Army. Ye Ting, the creator of the Chinese Red Army, was appointed commander, and each was designated as the New Fourth Army. Until December, they received an order to open the front line and summon the former Red Army scattered in various places. Each town and village left messengers to convey the message. The central government and the military did not fight. Since then, the Red Army's radio has also used this news to spread the news to middle-level commanders with radio. Officials used government trucks to go to Min, Zhejiang, Su, Wan, Yu, E, Yue, and Xiang provinces to spread Xiang's summons order. They then walked from these eight provinces to the meeting place. The shortest distance was 800 miles, and some people walked more than 2,000 miles. By the end of April, most of the army had gathered, accounting for 40% of the north bank of the Yangtze River and 60% of the south bank. Government personnel came to register the number of people and issue guns. Since the New Fourth Army fought with the Japanese army for the first time in Shucheng in early May, it has been fighting every day. According to their own records, the New Fourth Army fought for six months, and the Japanese army suffered more than 2,500 casualties, and about 500 rifles were captured. The New Fourth Army's base is in Anhui, and most of it is fighting on both banks of the Yangtze River in the province. A part of the army is active in Jurong and Jintan in the Nanjing area. Military supplies are supplied from the main base in Anhui. The New Fourth Army is commanded by the Third Theater Command and supplies military supplies. Its area of activity is roughly semi-circular, starting from the Nanjing area, extending 200 miles to the east and reaching Lu'an to the west. Its supply bases are within about 80 miles on both banks of the Yangtze River. The army on the north bank has 40% of its strength and is more suitable for guerrilla warfare than the south bank, because there are many steep mountains and forests, which can be easily hidden and ambushed, and there are also many large villages with sufficient food, and the mass movement is more popular. Therefore, when Japanese trucks drive into the area, the villagers are ready to help attack. According to the army, last summer, they overturned and destroyed as many as 60 Japanese trucks. The area of activity of the New Fourth Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River has two roads, which were used by the Japanese army to attack Hankou last summer. There is a mountain range between the two roads, so the area is also suitable for guerrilla warfare. According to the New Fourth Army, the highway from Hefei to Hanshan is now impassable, and the highway from Hefei to the south is often destroyed. When the Japanese army invaded Huangmei on the Hefei highway last year, although the New Fourth Army was not fully organized, it made full use of the terrain to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines, destroy highways, and destroy trees. At that time, the Japanese army had no surplus power and no intention of fighting with the guerrillas in the rear, and its invasion was therefore delayed. According to the army, when the Japanese army attacked Wuhan, they destroyed 150 Japanese trucks on the highway to Huangmei. Today, the New Fourth Army has captured Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Chaoxian. So far, the main bases of the Japanese army on the north bank are Hanshan and Anqing. The central bank is not as suitable for guerrilla warfare as the north bank, because there are many plains and crisscrossing rivers. The Japanese army can use small motorboats, and the river surface is about eight feet higher than the ground. The dikes are easy to break, causing floods, and there are almost no forests in the mountain range of Hejiang. The New Fourth Army is concerned about the people, so not only does it not break the dikes to trap the Japanese army, but it also prevents the Japanese army from doing so as much as it can. The Japanese army in the area, like the guerrilla areas in various places, only occupies the main traffic lines and large cities, and most of the area is still under Chinese rule. It is said that except for Jiangning County south of Nanjing, all other counties have county magistrates appointed by the government. To date, the Japanese army in the area has not dared to invade further, but has concentrated more to protect the traffic lines. The terrain behind the New Fourth Army on the south bank gradually rises, eventually reaching Huangshan, which is 1,400 meters above sea level. The area has beautiful scenery and a mild climate. Rice, wheat, and tea are the main products. The terrain is suitable for guerrilla warfare, and the products are abundant. The New Fourth Army in the area is expected to create a new record in its history.</p>
<h3>Specialized Personnel Trained in Yunnan: A Powerful Force for National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Kunming Correspondent for This Newspaper] In the near future, Yunnan will become a major university center in China. Currently, important educational institutions in Yunnan include the recently nationalized Yunnan University and the Southwest Associated University, formed by Tsinghua, Peking, and Nankai Universities. The courses currently used by these universities are still pre-war. Many people are demanding the adoption of education for the extraordinary period and the abolition of pre-war systems. However, some experts want to maintain the old system, only adding or changing some courses. Their reason is that we must resist the war and build the nation simultaneously. Therefore, the responsibility of university education now is to cultivate talent that is currently adapted to the needs and to continuously produce elements for future national construction. Resisting the war is not just an empty slogan; we must have competent individuals emerge and we must have the knowledge and skills to meet our responsibilities. For a young person who has completed high school education, the country hopes that he can contribute more than just the strength of a 'soldier' to the country. Therefore, the country hopes that some young people will be mobilized to the front lines and some will stay in the rear to acquire knowledge, and then return what they have gained to the country. This is one conclusion of the war.</p>
<p>From the current point of view, this proposition does have its advantages. For example, the Burma Railway and the Xukun Railway currently under construction are both war resistance and national construction projects. The talent required for these two railways is entirely supplied by university graduates from 1938. The quiet construction in Guizhou and Guangxi is also based on this group of young people as the backbone. They only receive a salary of forty or fifty catties of rice per month, but their work is heavy and requires specialized training. If university education were abolished, how could we instill this basic and even specialized knowledge into this group of construction cadres without war? Another thing worth reporting is the Radio Research Institute established by Tsinghua University in Chongqing. Every year, it sends graduates from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University from the Kunming United University to work there and directly under the command of Tsinghua professors in the Kunming United University. Now, the radio vacuum tubes used by the national army are all supplied by this research institute. Each copper wire in these vacuum tubes is handmade by these young college students. They rely on their experience to use their hands to replace instruments. Although their products are not cheaper than imported products, we can at least save a lot of foreign exchange and don't have to buy from foreign countries!</p>
<p>The Southwest Associated University here is currently trying to enable students to acquire special skills in the War of Resistance while also having basic training. For example, for their fourth-year students in the Department of Electrical Engineering, in addition to the required course in wireless principles, they also need to discuss practical wireless tubes. This includes the manufacture of code transceivers, with an emphasis on manual training. The principles can be largely ignored. In this way, when they finish the course, they will be able to manufacture and erect communication equipment for three or four hundred miles. They themselves will also serve as receiver-operators, and they can also pass on this skill to a youth with a middle-school education, so that they also have this skill. That is to say, if a guerrilla detachment or any small unit has someone who has received this training, they can communicate freely with other places. But we know that a communication device for three or four hundred miles can be made by one person manually. However, a radio device that communicates with European and American countries cannot be erected and managed by the ability of one person alone. It requires more specialized knowledge. Electrical engineering alone is not enough. It also requires astronomers and mechanical engineers to help. Therefore, crash courses for the extraordinary period cannot replace the basic training of science. This is the principle of university education that can be seen in Kunming now. In the near future, Zhejiang Tongji University and Zhongzheng Institute will also come to Yunnan. Their teaching methods will certainly also embody this principle. - Min Ge She</p>
<h3>"Front Gate" Brand Cigarette Tin Explodes; Jiaxing × Chief Injured; Our Guerrillas Active Near Taihu Lake; Escapees from Jiaxing Talk About the Local Situation</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent for This Newspaper] A certain businessman from Jingxing and Suzhou who recently went to the guerrilla area for business has recently returned to Shanghai. According to his interview with reporters, the guerrillas are becoming more active. Although × claims that the area has been pacified, this has not been achieved. In small villages less than five or six miles from Jiaxing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway line, there are guerrillas active. Those entering and leaving Jiaxing, unless they hang a "Good Citizen Card," are suspected of being the opposite. Those who offend × soldiers are abused. × troops explain their abuse of the people by saying that the person is a "Communist Party member." After Suzhou fell, only a small number of × troops remained stationed there. Recently, they have been harassed by guerrillas, and the × troops have no peace. Therefore, they are increasing their vigilance and reinforcing their forces. In the past, there were no military defenses in and around the city of Suzhou. However, in the past few weeks, bunkers and machine-gun nests have been built at the city gates. Every morning, gunshots from the × troops can be heard outside the city. The × troops say that they are practicing, but we know that they are fighting our guerrillas. Trains to Suzhou and Jiaxing run fairly on time. It is not possible to reserve or queue to buy train tickets, so people often gather at the station, waiting for the ticket windows to open. When × inspects the passengers' passes on the train, they collect a "small fee" for each item carried. One jiao for a bundle of fruit, two jiao for a package of clothes. Although there are no large-scale incidents of rape and looting now, at night, × soldiers still go to people's homes to rob valuables and harass women. Most of the rations needed by the Japanese army are forcibly supplied by the residents. × uses unscrupulous local ruffians as intermediaries to buy grain from farmers. Therefore, farmers and merchants can still buy and sell, but what they receive is the Japanese army's military currency. According to the current exchange rate, one yuan of Japanese military currency is worth one yuan of legal tender. However, in the past, the price of military currency was higher, with one yuan of Japanese currency being worth one yuan and two jiao of legal tender. The people have no trust in × troops due to the excessive issuance of military currency. They are also unwilling to accept Japanese paper money. Farmers often rely on homemade goods to survive, and they are still able to do so now. Therefore, the trade of Japanese merchants in the countryside has completely failed. Farmers try to exchange the Japanese currency they receive for legal tender, while merchants need Japanese currency because they are forced to use Japanese currency. The × army's efforts to prevent guerrillas from entering towns have also failed. A few days ago, a well-dressed Chinese man arrived at the military headquarters of Jingxing in a rickshaw. A servant came out to greet him. This person handed over two large tins of "Front Gate" brand cigarettes and a note, stating that they were to be delivered to the commander of the headquarters. "Front Gate" is the most popular cigarette brand in Jiaxing, so the × commander was very happy to see it. He opened the first tin and saw that the cigarette sticks were very neat. However, when he opened the second tin, a bomb exploded inside. The officer and many others were injured. When the Japanese army went out to arrest the person who sent the cigarettes, he had already disappeared. Although this person was able to enter, the local residents suffered a lot that night, as the × troops searched homes and arbitrarily arrested and punished suspicious people. The organization of the guerrillas behind the Japanese army's lines is clearly very strict. In addition to sniping at the × troops, there are also plainclothes teams active in towns and villages.</p>
<h3>Four Key Points for Young People</h3>
<p>- Shen Junru</p>
<p>Starting from the life in the rural frontlines - Special report by this newspaper</p>
<p>Recently, I went to the front lines with Mr. Zou Taofen and others. I went to the Ninth War Zone. Due to time constraints, I cannot tell you all the details, but I will briefly talk about two points of my feelings. These two points of my feelings can also be said to be what I realized after going to the front lines.</p>
<p>These two points of my feelings are: (1) regarding the life of the soldiers on the front lines; (2) regarding the life of the vast majority of people in the country, which is rural life.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the life of the soldiers on the front lines. People often ask: "Is the morale of the soldiers on the front lines strong?" I think this does not need to be asked, because what can we say about the hardship and loyalty of our soldiers and generals? The deeds are too numerous to mention. What I mainly want to talk about now is their lives. What is their life like? Their life can be said to have no so-called diet and daily life, nor so-called cultural life, etc. Not to mention the soldiers, even the generals often do not see a newspaper for half a month. How can we talk about spiritual food? As for another kind of food, they often don't eat anything for half a day. It is not necessarily because of a lack of food, but because they don't have time to worry about hunger, nor do they have time to cook. Cooking always has smoke and fire, which is enough to attract the enemy's attention and cause problems. Often, when cooking, if there is any disturbance, they have to give up. Food (especially drinking water) is really not easy to solve. On the front lines, there are no vegetables to eat. The people have run away, and there is nothing in the fields. In this way, vitamins are naturally lacking, and physical strength is affected. Regarding this vegetable problem, I heard someone say in Nanchang that transportation is very difficult. Because there is a lack of transportation, and even if it is transported, there are more important things than vegetables, so naturally vegetables cannot be sent first. Eating on the front lines is really a problem, such as salt, which is also very lacking.</p>
<p>There is no so-called "daily life" on the front lines. Often, when they need to sleep, they can't sleep, and there is no fixed time. Also, clothes are really not needed only when it is cold. Soldiers often sleep in the open air. Often, when they wake up in the morning, their chests are wet, which is very easy to get sick. It would be better if they had cotton vests.</p>
<p>There is also the problem of getting sick, which makes the soldiers even more painful. Not only the soldiers, but also the staff in the higher military organs in the so-called "rear of the front lines" also get sick a lot. Dysentery and malaria are the most common. Quinine is not absent, but the distribution is too insufficient. When they have chills and fever, they naturally have to rest, but they have to get up and hold a gun as soon as they feel a little better. They fight while sick. It is really touching. On the front lines, they walk at night. In the silence and darkness, we heard the moans of the soldiers and the sick soldiers. We only have emotion, only shame and uneasiness.</p>
<p>In this era of resistance, they have truly fulfilled the most arduous and sacred mission, but their lives are like this! This can and should be improved. As long as the front and rear are well connected, and the rear contributes more effort and more money, it can always be better. We people in the rear are really sorry for the soldiers on the front lines!</p>
<p>As for the so-called spiritual food, people in the rear now say that they want to send books and newspapers to the front lines. In fact, this is still empty talk. Because those books and newspapers can only be sent to the adjutant's office and the headquarters, etc., and cannot be sent to the soldiers on the front lines. Moreover, whether these books and newspapers can comfort them is still a question. From the point of view of volume, they cannot read our usual large newspapers in the trenches. They can only read smaller papers. I hope the cultural world will pay attention to this in the future. The reading materials should be small, and the content should not waste ink, because they need to save energy and time. The writing method should be concise, to the point, and clear, so that they can understand what is written at a glance. However, there are still very few such publications in the rear. If the cultural world sincerely wants to improve the lives of the soldiers on the front lines, they must do this!</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about rural life.</p>
<p>The life in the Chinese countryside can be imagined. In the countryside, regardless of men, women, old or young, they are all sallow and emaciated, not lively, not happy. The suffering they endure is by no means tolerable for people in the city. The houses they live in are very simple and dilapidated. They are very unsanitary. Most of the bedrooms are not lit by a little light, because there are no windows. It is pitch black at night, and there is still rotten mud under their feet. The construction of the countryside must be fundamentally changed. As for their diet, it is very bad. The things they eat and drink are simply unimaginable for their bodies. Since the bankruptcy of the countryside, the Chinese countryside is showing poverty everywhere. Also, there are too many illiterate people in the countryside. They cannot enjoy the pleasure of literacy like we do. They cannot obtain knowledge to influence their lives. They often cannot leave a place for the whole year. This is one reason why they have no knowledge. The War of Resistance has been going on for more than a year, but there are still many people in the countryside who are at a loss when asked about it.</p>
<p>After seeing the lives of the soldiers on the front lines and the farmers in the countryside, I thought that the sentence "young people should be hardworking" is for a reason. Today, our life should really take the life on the front lines as the standard. The responsibility of young people and cultural people is to reform society and change all the things that make people feel uneasy. Therefore, we should have a decision on our lives. What should our life be like? Currently, all parties are hoping for young people, and all parties are hoping that young people will take on the responsibility of reform. The generals on the front lines are eagerly hoping that young people will go to be lower-level enemy officers, hoping that young people will receive military education. In the administrative aspect, everyone also hopes that young people will go to be lower-level administrative officials. Currently, the county magistrates in many places cannot connect well with the troops, cannot cooperate well, do not know how to take responsibility, and do not care even when × people come. Therefore, good county magistrates are needed everywhere now, who are knowledgeable, capable, physically strong, enthusiastic about the War of Resistance, and even after being occupied, can still lead the people to fight as guerrillas. And this, everyone expects from young people. What all parties are hoping for from young people now is not empty talk, but hoping for actual responsibility. However, what should we young people do? We still feel that we need to learn, and young people still need to work hard to transform themselves and cultivate themselves. Working while learning in the work. According to general experience, young people are always stronger in doing things, but young people also have shortcomings, such as insufficient experience, etc.</p>
<p>Now I would like to suggest four points for young friends to consider:</p>
<p>First point: To be practical. - Young people are often too biased towards ideals, so there is a lack of young cadres who are truly capable of doing things. Therefore, to be practical. Everything must have concrete methods. Although the vision is very good, we cannot just have illusions. For example, a person's eyes can see a very far place, but there is no way under his feet. He cannot cross over there in one step, but must walk step by step. Whatever happens, you must act decisively.</p>
<p>Second point: To be great - I feel that the unity of Chinese youth is not enough at present. Often, they take themselves too seriously and cannot tolerate others. This has created all kinds of differences and all kinds of separations. It has already reached the point where we must unite to resist foreign aggression, but they are still unwilling to unite. This is very bad. We should make our minds and hearts great.</p>
<p>Third point: To be strong - After making a clear judgment on everything, we should do it strongly and not waver. - This is the strength of will. In addition, the body must also be trained to be strong. Only those with strong bodies can undertake arduous undertakings. For example, although I am old, I can still do some things because my body is still strong and can endure hardship.</p>
<p>Fourth point: To be tranquil - "Tranquility leads to far-reachingness" is the teaching of Zhuge Wuhou. These two words are excellent and not easy to explain. I would like to use driving a car as an example to explain it. When driving a car, the first thing is to concentrate. You must not think about other things when driving, otherwise problems will occur. To tell a joke, the philosophy of driving a car is "no two thoughts in mind." This is the root of tranquility. The second is to move forward. When driving a car, there is only forward, no backward. The third is to check yourself. When driving a car, the person and the car are one. I am the car, and the car is also me. Before driving the car, you must check the parts of your car, the water tank, etc., one by one. See if there are any problems that will hinder the journey. The most important part of tranquility is to check yourself. Fourth, pay attention to the actions on the street. When driving a car, you must pay attention to the actions of all people and things in front, behind, left and right. Pay attention to whether someone is walking over. Only in this way can tranquility be not a dead body. Fifth, avoid head-on collisions, because collisions do not necessarily achieve the purpose of eliminating obstacles, but will inevitably lead to the loss of yourself (the car). If you should stop, then stop. If you must take a detour, then you must take a detour. If you should get out of the car, then get out of the car. Persuade and take away the obstacles, and then move forward. Only in this way can tranquility have an effect.</p>
<p>My words should be over. In short, after I went to the front lines and saw the lives of the soldiers on the front lines and the lives of the farmers in the countryside, I thought of our responsibility, which should be to improve their lives in order to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance, and young people in particular should take responsibility. However, improving the lives of many people is something that only those who are hardworking and capable can do. Therefore, I suggest these four key points to young people: be practical, be great, be strong, be tranquil.</p>

<h3>Compatriots in Hong Kong Should Not Be Ashamed; Since the 15th Month of the War of Resistance, Compatriots in the Philippines Have Donated Over 10 Million; Calculated by Population, an Average of Over 100 Yuan per Person; The Boycott of Japanese Goods Has Spread Throughout the Philippines, and the Effects Are Becoming Increasingly Apparent</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese in various places launched a patriotic donation campaign like a storm. In the Philippines, there are about 100,000 overseas Chinese. They are very enthusiastic about the patriotic donation campaign. In the ten days after the July 7th Incident, the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various chambers of commerce and groups to concentrate manpower and financial resources and unify the steps for resisting Japan and saving the country. With the cooperation of the local consulate and the party headquarters, and the harmonious cooperation of the Min and Yue overseas Chinese, the Philippine Chinese Anti-Japanese Committee was established. After one year and three months of hard work, it has concentrated on raising war funds, mobilizing public bonds, saving the country's regular monthly donations, and boycotting Japanese goods. The results are very good. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce received a work report from the association yesterday for the past fifteen months, which is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>All Filipino Compatriots Are Mobilized</p>
<p>The Association is an organization spontaneously organized by the people. It is based on the spirit of automation and launches voluntary donations as the first step, calling on all compatriots, regardless of men, women, old or young, to mobilize together. On July 30, the Philippine Chinese Christian Youth Association invited wealthy merchants in the Chinese community to hold a discussion. In one night, more than 200,000 yuan was pledged. After the results were announced, the news spread like wildfire, and all parts of the island responded one after another. It is estimated that the association has remitted and directly remitted to the Ministry of Military Affairs and other government agencies successively up to 2,742,020.49 yuan. In September, Ning Hailing set up a fundraising committee for national salvation public bonds, a sub-committee in Hualvbin, and branches and fundraising agencies in various provinces. A total of 5,510,700 yuan was obtained for national salvation public bonds. After the fundraising for national salvation public bonds ended, in compliance with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, national salvation regular monthly donations were held. From the 27th of Ning Tuan Moon Scan to the end of September as the first phase, the amount collected and remitted was 2,378,798.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Donation Results Total Over 10 Million</p>
<p>The collection of war funds, national salvation public bonds, and national salvation regular monthly donations was at a time when business conditions were sluggish. Those who enthusiastically donated money often bear more than their own economic strength. This kind of rich spiritual sacrifice is admirable. However, there are also some who shirk their responsibilities and do not donate strongly, which is really regrettable. In the past fifteen months, the total amount of war funds, national salvation public bonds, and national salvation regular monthly donations amounted to 10,631,118.40 yuan. Calculated on the average of 100,000 people, each person has to bear 106 yuan. (The donations from the Aviation Construction Association, the Women's Comfort Association, the Guangdong Guild Hall, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Groups United Association, the Fujian Relief Association, etc. are not included). This result is really due to the sincere appeal of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the trust of the overseas Chinese, the efforts of the personnel of the Anti-Japanese Association in various places, the fundraising agencies, various national salvation organizations, various chambers of commerce, the efforts of various groups, and the cooperation of all members of the Association.</p>
<p>Mobilize the Whole Philippines to Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Under the decision of a long-term War of Resistance, boycotting Japanese goods to destroy the economic lifeline of the Japanese is a must. However, the overseas environment is different from the domestic one. How to avoid unnecessary sacrifices by overseas Chinese merchants, how to obtain the maximum price from the Japanese, how to take into account the neutral position of the resident government, and how to mobilize the efficiency of all the island's Chinese merchants must be planned in advance to be properly addressed. Therefore, before implementing the boycott, the Philippine Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce first convened various import merchants and trade associations, as well as relevant merchants, for detailed research. When the boycott was announced, a special committee was formed to carefully engage in the undertaking. The Boy Scout Corps was responsible for compulsory inspection and reconnaissance. Through the efforts of all parties, the gradual movement of resistance has now spread throughout the Philippines. The steps are gradually becoming more orderly, and the effects are becoming increasingly apparent. If our compatriots on the entire island can be united in good faith and maintain a unified will and steps, we will be able to achieve our established goals in the future.</p>
<p>Comforting Soldiers and Relieving Refugees</p>
<p>In addition to the above two points, the Association has also made joint efforts within the possible scope to promote a deeper understanding of the significance of our sacred War of Resistance to people of all countries, promote a deeper understanding, promote the sympathy of various countries, and connect the goodwill of friendly countries. In order to jointly unite the Chinese in the South Seas, the Association responded to the invitation of Mr. Chen Jiageng of Singapore and sent representatives Wang Quansheng, Chen Sanduo, and Xu Youchao to attend the General Assembly of Representatives of the Overseas Chinese in the South Seas for Fundraising for Refugees in the Motherland. In the future, our overseas Chinese in the Philippines should jointly promote the success of this great unity of the patriotic movement of the overseas Chinese in the South Seas. As for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees, its importance is no less than donating money to help the war. The Women's Group of the Association expanded its organization to form the Philippine Branch of the Chinese Women's Comforting and Self-Defense War of Resistance Soldiers Association, which is responsible for presiding over the event. The enthusiastic donations from the Chinese community have made its achievements very remarkable (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Restoration of Shipping Between Guangdong and Hong Kong? It is rumored that the Jinshan Ship Will Sail to Guangzhou Tomorrow; The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company Said it is Not True</h3>
<p>After Japan occupied Guangzhou, it imposed a blockade on the Pearl River waterway, exclusively monopolizing shipping rights. The call for a quick restoration of the Hong Kong shipping line has been repeatedly rumored. However, due to the above-mentioned reason, it has not been realized. According to yesterday's De Chen West News, the Pearl River opening issue has been successful. The Jinshan ship of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company is scheduled to sail from the Wing Lok Pier to Guangzhou at 8 am on Wednesday, but it only carries passengers to Shameen. The ship will only stay in Guangzhou for 48 hours before sailing back to Hong Kong. After this experiment, the Pearl River is expected to be fully opened, and the ships can run as usual. However, according to the news from the Chinese office of the shipping company, they said that they had not heard of the news. The Jinshan is still sailing the Hong Kong-Macau line and has not prepared to change its route to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Relief Federation of All Circles Urges All Relief Receiving Organizations to Report Relief Fund Income and Expenditures</h3>
<p>Deadline for Reporting to the Federation is the End of This Month; Report on Investigating Refugees Sent to Guangdong Chairman</p>
<p>The Joint Relief Federation of All Circles in Hong Kong for South China Refugees held a standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday.

It was resolved to send letters to each group and the various organizations receiving relief funds, requesting them to report. At the same time, regarding the telegram from Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, requesting an investigation of the disaster areas, it was limited to five days for the General Affairs, Investigation, Relief, and Propaganda groups to be responsible for the statistics. Five proposals from the Standing Committee were resolved, and the five resolved proposals are recorded as follows: (1) It is proposed to send letters to each group and the various organizations receiving relief funds from the Federation, requesting a report on income and expenditure before February 1st, in order to clarify procedures and facilitate public announcement. (2) It is proposed that future domestic relief efforts, to the extent that the Federation is capable, be handled directly or assisted by the Federation's relief group, with funds at the disposal of the relief group. If the Federation is incapable, it will entrust the requesting relief organization to distribute the relief on its behalf, but the details of the relief situation and the amount of income and expenditure must be reported to the Federation for investigation, and the funds will be signed off by the General Affairs Group. (3) It is proposed to allocate 1,000 national currency units to the Propaganda and Relief Association to relieve refugees. (4) It is proposed to entrust the General Affairs, Relief, Propaganda, and Investigation groups to investigate the disaster situation in South China and report in detail to Chairman Li Hanhun within five days.

<h3>In the Fourteen Months Since the Anti-Japanese War, Over 10,000 Hong Kong Fishermen Have Been Killed, Property Losses Totaling 8 Million Yuan, and 628 Vessels Have Been Burned</h3>
<p>Since Hong Kong fishing boats have been ravaged by × warships or armed fishing boats, the suffering of the population and the loss of silver have been incalculable. According to the investigation, from September 12, 1937, to November 30, 1938, the number of deaths reached 10,092, property losses amounted to 8 million yuan, and 628 vessels were destroyed. The figures for December to the present have not yet been calculated. It is now heard that the Fishermen's Association has petitioned the central government to find ways to provide relief. Mr. Xu Shiying of the China Relief Society has also reported to the central government to appeal on their behalf. After the central government investigates the matter thoroughly, there will certainly be legal measures to warn them in the future.</p>
<h3>A Builder in Shek Kip Mei Village, Sham Shui Po, Robbed Late at Night; Seven Armed Robbers Rushed in and Looted, Losses of Over 900 Yuan in Gold Jewelry and Clothing</h3>
<p>Zhu Yangwen, a 50-year-old builder, lives with his family in a certain house in Shek Kip Mei Village, Sham Shui Po, and employs a female servant, Ouyang Yue, to assist with housework. They have been living in peace for a long time. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhu and his family were fast asleep. Zhu woke up in the middle of the night and saw the servant Ouyang Yue in the hall. He asked her what was going on. According to her, she heard someone knocking on the door and suspected it was her sister returning home, so she got up to open the door. Zhu listened and allowed it. Unexpectedly, as the door opened, four unfamiliar men suddenly rushed in, one holding a pistol, two holding iron bars, and one empty-handed. They first intimidated the servant, then broke into the room and subdued Zhu and his family. Subsequently, three more men followed in and began to search and loot extensively. After several tens of minutes, clothing chests and valuables were all looted. Then they took a ladder and climbed over the wall to the neighboring house, escaping one by one from the rooftop. Afterwards, Zhu immediately blew a whistle to call the police, and after checking the belongings, estimated the loss to be approximately 973.04 yuan. Shortly after, the police arrived after hearing the news and accompanied Zhu to the police station to report the case.</p>
<h3>Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau Agrees to Allocate Railcars to Transport Refugees to Shenzhen; Rural Charity Society in Shenzhen Helps with Spring Ploughing; Guangdong Relief Society Establishes Mobile Hospital to Save Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the Relief Federation took over the Shenzhen Refugee Reception Center, it has been actively expanding the internal facilities. In recent days, the head of the Federation's Relief Group, Lin Peisheng, has been very busy going to the local area to plan all the work. According to Mr. Lin's return, two broadcasting stations will be built tomorrow. After completion, refugees can reach the British border in less than two minutes, which will provide greater safety for the refugees in the future. He also said that yesterday they continued to select and move refugees from Ping Shan. Those willing to go to Shenzhen reached more than 300 people, which was one of the best results since the relocation began. After the relocation of Ping Shan is completed, they will successively select and move refugees from Fanling Station and Tuen Mun San Hui. They have already obtained the consent of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau to transport Fanling refugees to Shenzhen free of charge with multiple railcars tomorrow. In Shenzhen, there will be an organization of rural charity societies, whose purpose is to carry out refugee relief work in the war zone from the British border to the Dongjiang River. The first team of ten service personnel has already started preparing work in Shenzhen, and two more teams will depart during the day to assist refugees returning to the recovered areas to engage in spring ploughing. The society is managed by Chen Pishi and cooperates with Wu Changyao of the Chinese Red Cross. Wu is responsible for organizing the hospital, which is sponsored by the Guangdong Relief Federation and has obtained the cooperation of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, which will send personnel to serve. The hospital is planned to be converted into a mobile one in the future to meet the needs of the rural environment, but a surgical operating room will still be set up. The Chinese Red Cross has already agreed to donate a full set of surgical instruments, and the Chinese Medical Association has also sent a surgeon to serve. Although the hospital has only been open for a week, many villagers in the nearby area with illnesses go to the hospital for treatment. The hospital has now admitted 150 patients. Since its establishment, five babies have been born in the hospital's maternity ward, including one boy and four girls. The mothers are all refugees. In addition, the society hopes to establish medical clinics in Nantou and Shatoujiao to expand its scope of work.</p>

<h3>Another Brave Man Shot and Wounded in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon; The Shooter is an Indian Soldier Stationed in the Camp; The Wounded Man Fainted on the Spot and Was Sent to the Hospital</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 PM yesterday, another shooting occurred in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon. As a result, a soldier in the camp was shot and wounded by an Indian soldier stationed in the camp. The wound was on the right shoulder near the kidney. The wounded man was about 30 years old. After being injured, he was unconscious and was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. According to the Indian soldier who fired the gun, he told the commanding officer that the wounded man intended to leave the camp. He ordered him to stop, but the wounded man continued to move forward, so he fired the gun. It has been found that since the arrival of the brave men stationed in Ma Tau Chung, on the eve of Christmas, Indian soldiers stationed in the camp shot and wounded two people. One person died the next day, and the other wounded person is still being treated in Kowloon Hospital. Now, a similar incident has occurred again. Perhaps the Indian soldiers stationed in the camp and the brave men cannot communicate with each other, resulting in conflicts. It is hoped that appropriate measures will be taken to handle the aftermath. According to a report in the South China Morning Post yesterday afternoon, a brave man in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon had left the camp and his whereabouts are still unknown. It has been found that the Indian soldier rifle team stationed in the camp is only equipped with concussion guns. When the on-duty soldier discovered it, he fired a shot at him, believing that he had hit him. Unfortunately, only a few small bullets had little effect. It is also said that after this incident, the soldiers guarding the area were issued live ammunition for their rifles.</p>
<h3>The National Hospital Maternity Ward is Lent to the Children's Welfare Association to Shelter Refugee Babies; Renovation Will Be Completed in Two Weeks; Up to Eighty Refugee Babies Can Be Sheltered</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong branch of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association has requested the government to lend out the maternity ward of the old National Hospital for the purpose of sheltering orphan babies. Now, with the government's permission to lend it out, the Association has started to renovate the interior of the maternity ward in order to be able to move the refugee babies in as soon as possible. The interior setup is expected to be ready in about two weeks, and up to eighty refugee babies can be sheltered. It has been found that the refugee baby shelter not only shelters refugee babies under one year old, but also shelters orphans of Hong Kong residents who have died of illness. Currently, charitable organizations are sending more than ten orphans from Tung Wah Hospitals, twelve from Po Leung Kuk, and more than twenty from private individuals to the shelter, totaling seventy, including refugee babies. However, there is a severe shortage of breastfeeding utensils, powdered milk, and clothing for these dozens of refugee babies. The Association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate milk, milk bottles, clothing, and other items.</p>
<h3>With a Sense of Justice, Indian Doctor Yadao Flies to Chongqing Today to Return to the Front Line, Carrying Three Sets of Amado's Laryngoscopes Worth a Fortune</h3>
<p>Indian doctor Yadao, who supports our country's War of Resistance with justice, led a team of five doctors to serve in China, traveling back and forth across the country, and his enthusiasm for treating wounded soldiers and refugees is commendable. It has been found that Dr. Yadao fell ill in late last month and came to Hong Kong for a long period of recuperation. He has recently recovered and is scheduled to fly back to Chongqing from Hong Kong by plane today to return to the front line to serve. This great spirit of fearlessness is worthy of our admiration. Dr. Yadao also mentioned that the equipment was prepared by the team itself.</p>
<h3>Guangdong New Chairman Li Hanhun Sends Telegram to Hong Kong to Console Overseas Chinese; Expresses Respect for Overseas Chinese' Concern for the Motherland; Hopes to Promote and Carry Forward the Responsibility of Every Citizen</h3>
<p>Chairman Li believes that the Hong Kong overseas Chinese, whether they have enthusiastically donated money or participated in the war effort, are showing justice, which is admirable. On the day of his inauguration, he sent a telegram to Li Xingchong, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, to convey his condolences to all overseas Chinese. The text of the telegram reads: "Hanhun has served in the army for a long time. When Guangzhou fell, he was ordered to return to the army. He was just about to repair my spears and eliminate the stubborn ×, but he was briefly ordered to govern Guangdong. With the rest of his military life, he bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining the border. At a time when the four suburbs are heavily fortified, there are those who abandon difficulties and leave great achievements. The military affairs are urgent, and I cannot refuse to shoulder the responsibility. Therefore, I took office today. Considering the affairs of the province, there are countless things to be managed. After the relocation, it is necessary to rectify them. Han accepts the order to overcome difficulties and dedicates himself to his hometown. He only has to use his wisdom and loyalty to revitalize the Party and the country. The sages have said that governing does not require many words. I secretly admire this meaning. I hope that the people and gentlemen of the country will not hesitate to supervise and urge me, so that I can take it as a guide and use it as a rule. Since the War of Resistance, the people of Guangdong have been able to deeply understand the great righteousness and endure hardships without complaint. Especially my overseas Chinese compatriots have cared for the motherland, either with their blood and sweat, enthusiastically donating money, or with men rushing to me, not avoiding dangers. The righteousness is shining, which is admirable. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. I hope that all of you will follow the precepts of not being proud when you hear of victory and not being discouraged when you hear of defeat, and even more carry forward and expand it. I respectfully send a telegram to express my condolences, and I cannot write them one by one. Li Hanhun (Four branches) Xu."</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Air Force Held a Large Bombing Exercise Yesterday; Dropped 500-Pound Large Bombs; Bombed Shek Ngau Wan in the New Territories</h3>
<p>In order to review the air defense capabilities, the Hong Kong military authorities have been continuously conducting live ammunition exercises of the air force and anti-aircraft guns for the past month, and have achieved very good results. Recently, in order to test the power of bombs, a large-scale bombing exercise was carried out. The Air Force Headquarters issued a notice a few days ago, scheduling the exercise to be held at Shek Ngau Wan in Ma Shi Wan, New Territories, on the next two days. It has been found that from 10:00 AM yesterday, the Air Force Department dispatched multiple bombers equipped with multiple 500-pound and 50-pound large bombs, flying out one after another.

<h3>Mr. Tao Xingzhi Talks About the Education Problems in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Qi</p>
<p>Running a school should have a purpose, not to make money</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi discussed the general education problems during the war, and the reporter once published a special article in this newspaper on New Year's Day. What are Mr. Tao's thoughts and instructions on education in Hong Kong? This problem, which is even closer to us, is an important problem that those who care about it are concerned about. Now, let the reporter report to the readers the conclusions drawn from the interview with Mr. Tao, and especially ask the school authorities and the cultural and educational circles to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>A building, a signboard, students paying expensive tuition fees, teachers "reading from the book," trading and leaving, each getting what they want. Let the personality edification and national consciousness be dead nouns in education. Such education really makes us feel a headache. The first question to ask Mr. Tao, of course, is this problem of commercialization of education.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao's answer is this: "We cannot be too harsh on the expensive tuition fees of general schools in Hong Kong, because the schools have no funds. How can teachers run schools on empty stomachs? Under a capitalist society, knowledge has also become a commodity, and the form of buying and selling is inevitable. The key is that schools should have a purpose in running the school in addition to charging tuition fees. It is still not blameworthy to work hard towards the purpose of running the school. If you collect the fees and then everything is over, and you do nothing in a muddled way, purely for the purpose of making money, then it is unforgivable. As for the implementation of education, there should be at least one current affairs interpretation per week. After understanding current affairs, young people will surely be aware of the hope that the motherland has for them, and will surely realize that it is not enough to just know English."</p>
<p>Although Mr. Tao's answer is very simple, the meaning is very concise. The first is not to be too harsh on the commercialization of education in a capitalist society, and the second is that there should be a purpose in running the school, and at least one current affairs interpretation should be given per week.</p>
<p>The second question is the ideological problem of some students in Hong Kong. The reporter uses the experience of a young friend as a concrete example: She is a student of a certain secondary school in Hong Kong. When she saw the heroic eight hundred warriors and the fluttering national flag on the screen in the theater, she sensitively stood up to pay tribute. However, she was the only one standing in the entire theater, and the contemptuous and horrified gazes were concentrated on her. She felt very embarrassed. She forgives the ignorant crowd. But she was indignantly dissatisfied that her classmates were also so confused. When she returned to school to debate, her classmates poured cold water on her with specious words.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao smiled and said: "This is because her skills are not enough. She should simply explain the reason for paying tribute and call on everyone to stand up together. At that time, some people will definitely be moved and respond, and even those who do not stand up will not dare to laugh at others, right? She is very enthusiastic and patriotic, but she doesn't have enough courage! ..." The reporter also laughed along with Mr. Tao.</p>
<p>The third question is the boredom of cultural people who have fled to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>With the expansion of the occupied areas, cultural people have also been forced to flee to Hong Kong. The number is so large that doctors alone account for more than 120 people. Other teachers, students, writers, reporters... are countless. Many of this large group of intellectuals are also sensitive. Lying idle in Hong Kong, they have tasted all kinds of embarrassing stimuli. Those with slightly less firm will immediately show signs of shaking, pessimism, and decadence.... In the midst of the high-pitched call for national mobilization, and the panic of the lack of cadres in the mainland, on the one hand, there are people who have nothing to do, and on the other hand, there are things that no one can do. What a contradictory phenomenon!</p>
<p>Mr. Tao's answer is: "Those who have no work to do in Hong Kong should return to the mainland to work. It is certainly not easy to find a job for a doctorate with several hundred yuan in this day and age. In fact, there is work to do everywhere. Zhao Laotai only knows the four characters 'Zhao Hongwenguo', how can she have something to do? Why is she welcomed everywhere? People should look for things to do, not wait for things to look for people...."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the reporter interrupted and said: "Indeed, there are also many young people who are willing to work hard and serve the country, but unfortunately there is no way to apply!"</p>
<p>Mr. Tao continued: "Mobilization work is now in progress; it is not a problem to find work in the mainland at present."</p>
<h3>The Gambling Case of Da Guan Film Company Adjudicated; Zhao Shushen and Chen Chengjia Guilty of Gambling; Representatives of the Women's Comfort Association Attend the Court to Deny Knowledge; Zhao and Chen Both Fined Ten Yuan, Others Reprimanded</h3>
<p>The case of Zhao Shushen, the manager of Da Guan Film Company, and Chen Chengjia, an employee, who were previously charged with gambling, has been reported in previous newspapers. The trial resumed at 11:30 AM yesterday, with Deputy Attorney General Wei Yi prosecuting and lawyer Mai Jialin defending the defendants. Because the testimony of Tang Shurong in the previous trial of this case involved the Women's Comfort Association, the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association specially sent several representatives and entrusted the Association's perennial legal advisor, lawyer Guan Zuyou, to attend the court to observe the trial. After the court session began, the ninth defendant, Li Jia, did not attend, and the judge ruled that the bail money be confiscated. The second defendant, Chen Chengjia, testified, stating that he was an employee of Da Guan Film Company and a member of the Da Guan Company Sports Association. On the evening of the 24th of last month, the Sports Association held a variety show, which included poker, pai gow, billiards, ring toss, etc., with commissions donated to refugees. Gambling was not done with cash, but with green, white, and red paper slips instead. Green ones were worth one yuan, red ones were worth one dime, and white ones were worth one cent. About 200 people came to play that night from 1:00 PM. He then answered the cross-examination of the chief prosecutor, lawyer Wei Yi, saying that when the police surrounded and arrested them, he was managing the pai gow commission box. He had never been a banker, and there was no fixed amount for the commission, but it depended on the person. Approximately three or four tenths of the winnings were taken as commission. He was only in charge of managing the commission affairs, and he did not know about the other arrangements. Lawyer Guan Zujing then made a statement on behalf of the Women's Comfort Association, stating that although the Women's Comfort Association had held celebrity football matches and other events to raise funds to relieve refugees in the past, they had not heard of Da Guan Company raising funds for the Association this time, so they did not know the methods they adopted. Lawyer Mai Jialin, the defendant's lawyer, and chief prosecutor, lawyer Wei Yi, then discussed the case in detail. At 1:30 PM, the judge finally ruled that the first defendant, Zhao Shushen, and the second defendant, Chen Chengjia, were guilty and fined ten yuan. The other defendants were warned not to commit the crime again in the future.</p>
<h3>One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Expands Promotion; Held Separately by Various Merchant Shops</h3>
<p>The Chaozhou Eight Counties Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong held a meeting yesterday afternoon to respond to the One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement. Chairman Lin Zican and other councilors jointly discussed and negotiated promotion methods. As a result, it was decided to expand the promotion, and the method was to be handled separately by various Chaozhou merchant shops, held by the east and west families separately. For example, if a merchant shop has 30 employees, the 30 employees will solicit from relatives and friends. Assuming that each person gets two people, then the employees of the shop can bear a minimum of 90 yuan in debt repayment money. The shop also repays 90 yuan from the east family. The number of employees in each shop is based on this method. In this way, the scope can be expanded.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Tenants' Association</h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>A Conversation with the Person in Charge</p>
<p>To escape the ravages of the × people, hundreds of thousands of compatriots have poured into this haven of Hong Kong. As a result, empty buildings that were once overlooked are now being snapped up for rent, and some landlords are taking advantage of the situation to increase rents. Countless compatriots are being forced to move, and countless compatriots are being left to sleep in the open. The whole of Hong Kong has been seething. Today, the tide of evictions seems to have subsided on the surface, but the undercurrents are still too numerous to count. Therefore, the long-planned Hong Kong and Kowloon Tenants' Association was quickly established. Yesterday afternoon, a ceremony was held at the Winsor Hotel to receive reporters and report on the preparations. In today's situation where countless tenants are restless, the birth of this association is of great significance.</p>
<p>Before the meeting started, guests from all sides arrived one after another. At this time, they gathered in groups of three or five by the fireplace; or sat around the table, talking and laughing. The roaring fire reflected on everyone's faces, giving them a rosy complexion. When the topic turned to the unscrupulous landlords forcing evictions, everyone gnashed their teeth, their bodies burning with heat; it was hard to tell whether it was the warmth of the fire or the high tide of anger. On the left, someone said, "Secure housing before prosperous business"; on the right, someone said, "The landlord's forced eviction is tantamount to disrupting social order and tranquility." A 'Uncle' sitting on the side sighed and said, "Some tenants are suffering from the double oppression of the landlord and the sub-landlord, isn't that even more miserable?" Everyone listened, and fell silent!</p>
<p>Talking about the issue of membership qualifications, a member of the preparatory committee said, "According to the articles of association, not only can all tenants join, but landlords are also welcome to join, because the articles of association stipulate provisions for mediating member disputes." A guest on the side interjected, "Landlords and tenants are as different as horses and cattle. Since this association was established to resist forced evictions by landlords, how can we expect landlords to join the tenants' camp? Isn't this a farce?" The person in charge listened and pondered for a moment, saying, "This question is worth studying!"</p>
<p>Then they talked about the fact that the lower and middle classes suffer the most oppression, so they especially welcome tenants of bed spaces to join the association, provided they can pay the fees according to the rules. However, most bed space tenants are poor lower and middle class people, whose daily rent is only one or two dollars. Can they pay the membership fee and basic fund of three dollars and forty cents at once? The person in charge also pondered for a moment, saying, "This question is also worth studying!"</p>
<p>The landlord's unreasonable eviction will naturally lead to litigation, and the tenants' association will naturally help its members. In that case, all the costs of lawsuits will of course be borne by the association? The person in charge also pondered for a moment, saying, "This is also worth studying!"</p>
<p>The so-called unreasonable eviction by the landlord, but how exactly is it unreasonable, and what is the standard to use? "Of course, we will base it on the government's regulations that landlords' rent increases cannot exceed 25%," the person in charge said affirmatively. However, if a tenant suffers from the landlord's oppression, once a lawsuit is filed, the authorities will naturally cite this regulation, without the need for the Tenants' Association to worry about it.</p>
<p>Continuing to talk about the regulations for protecting tenants that the authorities need to issue, there are many points that are not yet perfect, such as "if the tenant's losses are not as great as the landlord's losses, the landlord can demand that the tenant move out." "This clause gives landlords many opportunities for forced eviction. Regarding this type of issue, we would like to collect all of them and submit them to the government, calling for improvement!" Among the many words spoken by this person in charge, this should be a relatively satisfactory statement!</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Champs-Élysées in Paris</h3>
<p>The Champs-Élysées is the most beautiful and moving avenue in Paris, and also the best-designed thoroughfare in the world. It is the first scenic spot for tourists who come to Paris for the first time. What Paris can offer is the Champs-Élysées. After I arrived in Paris, although there were many places I wanted to visit, the Champs-Élysées was an important destination. It was a clear and sunny morning. The rain had stopped, and the streets were still very wet. I put on a raincoat and hurried to the Louvre Museum. Leaving the square of the museum, I suddenly left the hustle and bustle of the city and entered another quiet and secluded realm. Around me were only green meadows, colorful and vibrant exotic flowers. In front was a round square, also planted with many flowers and plants, designed into various patterns, which is the Place du Carrousel. Cars can enter from the left gate of the museum, pass through this round square, and then exit from the right gate of the museum. Passing the round square, standing in front is the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. This Arc de Triomphe is much smaller than the Arc de Triomphe at the Place de l'Étoile. It is only 48 feet high, 63 feet wide, and 21 feet deep. It was built by Napoleon I to commemorate his two victories in 1805 and 1806. Although this Arc de Triomphe is not as magnificent as the one at the Place de l'Étoile, it is also exceptionally elegant in design. The original design was by the famous artists Fontaine and Percier, based on the Roman Arc de Triomphe. The top is engraved with many war-related reliefs, all carefully crafted by the major artists of the time. More interesting is a chariot drawn by four horses on the upper level. This chariot is no longer the original from that year. When Napoleon built this Arc de Triomphe, the chariot was originally a trophy seized from Venice, Italy. Of course, this was used by Napoleon to represent their victory commemoration. In 1814, when France was defeated, this chariot was requested by Italy and had to be removed from the top of the Arc de Triomphe and returned to Italy. Later, King Louis XVIII of France re-made one and installed it, which is the original object that remains today. The history of this Arc de Triomphe is nearly two hundred years. It has personally witnessed the rise and fall of the French dynasties. Now it is also weathered and dilapidated, no longer with the heroic posture of the past.</p>
<p>Walking forward from this Arc de Triomphe, you will soon reach the Jardin des Tuileries. At the top of the garden, there is a wide walkway, but vehicles cannot pass through it. This garden has an area of only about fifty acres, with trees, flowers, pavilions, and terraces, arranged in a charming and orderly manner, punctuated in the midst of the colorful scenery by fountains and art sculptures. This area was once the imperial palace. Napoleon I also resided here during his reign. Unfortunately, after he went abroad, several revolutions occurred. This palace was also repeatedly destroyed. Finally, in 1871, the Communists occupied Paris. This magnificent Tuileries Palace was also burned to the ground. The current garden is the site of the former palace. The vicissitudes of life are truly unbearable to recall.</p>
<p>Walking into the intoxicating Tuileries Garden, what appears in front of you is the world-famous Place de la Concorde. In my personal estimate, the perimeter of this square is at least half a mile. To the north is the Ministry of the Navy, to the south is the Seine River, to the east is the Tuileries Garden, and to the west is the Champs-Élysées. I remember that Su Dongpo has a famous saying, "All things are observable, and if they are observable, they are all delightful." I feel that when visiting scenic spots, if you always have a mood of appreciation and remembrance, then naturally "all things are observable," not only approachable but also delightful. The same thing, in the eyes of someone who is good at textual research, is loved and cannot be released, while in the eyes of another person, it may seem ordinary and not worth a look. I think it is a pity that a visit without the ability to appreciate and remember is a most regrettable thing. Why am I suddenly talking about this? Because the Place de la Concorde, in the eyes of ordinary people, is just a bustling place with heavy traffic, and it is over after a hasty walk. How can you know that this square contains many interesting historical materials and occupies a very important page in French history?</p>
<p>In the center of the square stands a stone monument. At first glance, it seems very ordinary. If you study it, then this stone monument has its origins. The monument is named Obelisk of Luxor, 76 feet high and weighing 240 tons. It was given to King Louis Philippe of France by the King of Egypt in 1831. Let's think about it, how could such a huge stone be transported from Egypt to Paris at that time? It seems like a dumb riddle. According to historical records, this giant monument was placed in the Place de la Concorde in 1836. From this calculation, the time spent transporting it in transit was nearly five years. At that time, for the sake of a giant stone, I don't know how much manpower and material resources were spent. The tyranny of the emperors in the autocratic era often created things that could not be created. The Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Egypt are not obvious examples?</p>
<p>On each side of the giant monument there is a large fountain, divided into several shapes like candlesticks, spraying to a height of about 30 feet. The central pipe sprays straight into the sky, and there are several smaller pipes around it that spray towards the middle, splashing beads and flying jade, which is very beautiful. Among the many fountains in Paris, these two may be the greatest and most beautiful. Looking at this vast round square, and the bustling traffic of soldiers, horses, and pedestrians, it seems that this place is only full of joy and harmony. However, if we recall the history of France, then this "joy" and "harmony" will immediately disappear, "turning into solemnity" and "terror." Originally, at the end of the eighteenth century, France was plagued by wars. From January 1793 to July 1794, Paris was trapped in an atmosphere of extreme terror. This Place de la Concorde was the execution ground for killing people at that time. The killing of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette was carried out here. Other royal nobles, as well as later revolutionaries, killed people from time to time, and were killed from time to time. All kinds of tragic scenes were staged on the guillotine here. Thinking of this, the scene of Louis XVI ascending the guillotine seems to reappear in front of me, how terrible!</p>
<p>The cars on the Place de la Concorde come and go like shuttles. It is not easy for pedestrians to cross the road. I detoured in front of the Ministry of the Navy and waited for more than ten minutes before I had the opportunity to reach the entrance of the Champs-Élysées. There are two stone statues at the entrance of the Champs-Élysées, with a prancing horse carved on the top, galloping. A person on the side is holding a rein, showing a very anxious look. The expression is flying and free, and it is indeed a famous work of art. The Champs-Élysées itself can be divided into two parts. One part starts from the Place de la Concorde entrance at the east end and ends at the Rond-Point. This section is about half a mile long and is entirely a park. The avenue passes through the large park. On the side of the street are two rows of very neat plane trees, and next to the trees is a sidewalk. On the side of the sidewalk, there are four rows of trees, trimmed neatly, lush and beautiful. Next to the trees, there are several sections, which are the gardens. Therefore, this section of the Champs-Élysées is in the middle of the trees and gardens. Inside the gardens, there are pavilions, fountains, brilliant flowers, and beautiful ponds. In the afternoon, many tourists stay on the seats in this area. A children's playground is also set up in the garden, with various novel scientific toys to impart knowledge to the children.</p>
<h3>Chengdu's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Xu Eryin</p>
<p>Clothing In Guangdong and Guangxi, we see short outfits everywhere, and it's rare to see anyone wearing a long gown. But in Chengdu, we see long gowns everywhere, and wearing short outfits is rare. It's exactly the opposite. Chengdu also has a tradition of wearing mandarin jackets, and not only middle-aged and elderly people wear them, but young people can't do without them either. One of my classmates used to wear Western suits and hats in Shanghai, but after returning to Chengdu for four years, he now wears light silk robes, black mandarin jackets, and a melon-shaped skullcap. Civil servants naturally wear Zhongshan suits, but because most civil servants are a bit hunchbacked and can never stick their chests out, they still can't muster any spirit when wearing Zhongshan suits. Students, of course, all wear grey sesame cloth student uniforms. Many Sichuan students often go into tea shops, open the buttons on their necks, put their belts on the tea table, and sit like they're not sitting, sleep like they're not sleeping, sprawled in bamboo chairs. This is even more uncouth than the remnants of the long gown and mandarin jacket era.</p>
<p>Women's clothing is the same as everywhere else, from ancient times to Westernization, you can see it all.</p>
<p>On the street, what especially attracts the attention of newcomers are the lamas, in their dark red robes. The clothing of ordinary Hui people is exactly the same as ours, as are their food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Food Speaking of Chengdu's food, it's really hard to put it all in writing. Sichuan cuisine is famous, needless to say, but what makes people even more unforgettable are the many snacks that you can only taste when you get to Chengdu.</p>
<p>On my first night in Chengdu, I was taken by my classmate Yuan to a snack shop called "Wu Wonton." I thought to myself, it must be named after a talented chef named Wu. I heard my classmate order "two servings of wonton," and I realized that wonton is a kind of food. I asked my classmate, and he told me that wonton is called 'chaosho' here. Besides Wu wonton, there's also Dwarf Wonton and Ye Deguai, all of which are clean, but the small storefronts are always crowded. It's well-deservedly famous. A small bowl is enough to make you ask for more. The taste is indescribable. In short, Chengdu's snacks all have several things in common: they're cheap, delicious, and never filling.</p>
<p>The water rice cakes in Lychee Lane are a pity because they have to add a lot of chili. If you can't eat spicy food, the spiciness will drive away the deliciousness.</p>
<p>A serving of steamed dumplings has ten pieces, but it's only equivalent to one or two pieces elsewhere. You can put them all in your mouth without feeling like it's too much. Lai Tangyuan and Twenty-Four Spring, no one can surpass its glutinous rice balls.</p>
<p>In short, Chengdu is a quaint city, and Chengdu has a lot of "decadent snacks" that don't hurt the spleen and stomach. As Mr. Zhou Zuoren said, it's a pity that Mr. Zhou didn't think that there was such a good place outside of Beijing.</p>
<p>Housing Of course, Chengdu also has slums, which are located outside the city and in remote areas.</p>
<p>Inside the city, it's completely different. The Europeanized area is Chunxi Road, with its shops on the commercial field, while the ancient style still remains in Shaocheng, with its residences, large, medium, and small mansions.</p>
<p>Whether a mansion is large, medium, or small, first, the gatehouse must look presentable. Second, there must be a red lantern hanging at the gate. Third, there must be a white-haired gatekeeper sitting between the front gate and the second gate. This gatekeeper may be partially paralyzed, or may be blind, and nine out of ten love to doze off, so people coming in and out will not be stopped every time. It is said that this is only to make the "mansion look like a mansion."</p>
<p>Entering the second gate, you can see one or two withered trees, three or four thin bamboos, five or six pots of chrysanthemums, a wide hall, and a lifeless courtyard.</p>
<p>Chengdu people's housing is probably the same as their transportation, maintaining a full officialdom atmosphere.</p>
<p>Transportation Chengdu people rarely go out. Chengdu is nine and one-third li, and they say they just live their whole lives within these nine and one-third li. Going out of Niushikou is already a big deal. Going to Shanghai is also called studying abroad, and you can get a scholarship from the provincial government. After returning from studying abroad, you don't have to compete for a job, and no one cares what you've learned outside.</p>
<p>But Chengdu people still don't like to move. They can't bear to leave the comfortable, leisurely, and carefree Chengdu.</p>
<p>Chengdu people walking on the street are mostly doing nothing. Maybe they just came out of a tea shop, or maybe they're going to some "De Yi Fang," "Yi He Yuan," or "Bu Ru Ti" to taste tea. They always walk very slowly, so even rickshaws can only go slowly, because the sidewalk and the road, except for cars that have to give way when important people pass by, the center of the road has leisurely strollers.</p>
<p>Chengdu has few cars and many rickshaws, which are also cheap, making it the best in the country. There are horses, mules, buses, sedan chairs, sedan chairs, wooden boats, and charcoal road vehicles. The roads of Shu are not difficult, but the difficulty lies in the lack of modern means of transportation, but it's still okay.</p>

<h3>Plummeting Paper Industry in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The paper industry in Hong Kong has always been stable. Moreover, with the flourishing of the printing industry in China in recent years, the paper industry has also become increasingly developed. Investigations show that annual trade reached a massive sum of over ten million yuan. However, since the start of the Sino-Japanese war, the areas in China where the publishing industry was most prosperous have successively fallen. The railway transportation of Hong Kong's paper industry has been greatly affected. And with the subsequent fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, various places in North and Central China have stopped purchasing from Hong Kong due to difficulties in transportation. Therefore, paper prices have plummeted continuously, and the market has become increasingly bleak. Goods ordered some time ago remain stored in warehouses, unable to be released due to stagnant purchases. Furthermore, Western merchants are urging shipment as the deadline has passed. Consequently, paper merchants are generally at a loss for solutions. Many are losing as much as four or five hundred thousand yuan, or two or three hundred thousand yuan. Comparing the paper industry today with its former state, there is indeed a world of difference. Investigations show that most of Hong Kong's paper goods come from abroad, with Germany and Austria being the most prominent, followed by Italy, and Sweden and Czechoslovakia the least. Japanese goods are now completely absent.</p>
<p>There are countless varieties of paper, making it impossible to list them all. They can be roughly divided into the following categories: (1) newsprint in rolls, (2) flat newsprint, (3) glossy white paper, (4) glossy colored paper, (5) semi-glazed newsprint, (6) Shandu paper, and (7) cardboard, etc. Among these, newsprint in rolls is the most commonly used, with the majority coming from Germany and Austria. Shandu paper is made from the local clay paper in Foshan, Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>The annual sales of Hong Kong paper to Guangdong inland reached more than four million yuan, while Guangxi accounted for seventy to eighty million yuan annually. Since the fall of Guangzhou, sales in the two Guangs (Guangdong and Guangxi) have almost come to a standstill. Currently, the only markets are Shantou, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and overseas markets such as Siam (Thailand) and Annam (Vietnam).</p>
<h3>The Latest Paper Prices Are Listed Below</h3>
<p>50-gram newsprint in rolls: 6.4 cents per pound</p>
<p>48-gram newsprint in rolls: 6.8 cents per pound</p>
<p>Flat newsprint (500 sheets per ream): 3 yuan, 4 hao, 5 cents</p>
<p>Glossy white paper (14 pounds per ream): 1 yuan, 7 hao, 5 cents</p>
<p>Inferior glossy white paper (14 pounds per ream): 1 yuan, 7 hao</p>
<p>Glossy colored paper (500 sheets per ream): 2 yuan, 0 hao, 5 cents</p>
<p>Shandu paper (20 pounds per ream): 2 yuan, 4 hao, 5 cents</p>
<p>Shandu paper (22 pounds per ream): 2 yuan, 5 hao, 5 cents</p>
<p>Shandu paper (24 pounds per ream): 2 yuan, 7 hao, 5 cents</p>
<p>Cardboard: 1 hao to 1 hao, 2 cents per pound</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Eliminates "Youth Shelters," Northeast Agricultural Production Declines Year After Year</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army often utilizes sorghum and wheat fields as cover for guerrilla warfare, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, causing considerable difficulty for the Japanese army. Therefore, in recent years, they have vigorously restricted the planting of sorghum, advocating instead the planting of soybeans and cotton, under the guise of revitalizing specialty products, while in reality engaging in a war of attrition. However, the Volunteer Army can still hide in soybean fields and cotton fields. Therefore, with each battle, agricultural products are dug up and destroyed in retaliation. Under these circumstances, the harvest of agricultural products in the Northeast has, of course, sharply decreased compared to before the September 18th Incident. In addition, the war is ceaseless in various places, and farmers work intermittently. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, Northeast youths have been forced to join the army, sent to fight their compatriots, impacting agricultural production, which is naturally even worse. According to a survey by the Yamazaki Economic Research Institute, the average harvest of agricultural products in the Northeast from 1934 to 1936 was already 16.5% lower than the average harvest from 1927 to 1931. This year's estimated agricultural harvest is even lower than the second estimate. A comparative table is as follows:</p>

<h3>Li Hua Cup Football: Preliminary Round, Chinese United vs. Navy; Silver Shield Quarter-Final and Semi-Final Dates Also Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Telegram] Yesterday afternoon, the Football Association held its monthly meeting. Attendees included Hua Zhuan (Chairman), Jian Na, Huang Jiajun, Mai Jilufei, Gaodunbo (Secretary), etc.</p>
<p>The Secretary read out the minutes of the last meeting and discussed various important items.</p>
<p>(1) Discussion of the Special Silver Shield Quarter-Final and Semi-Final events. Regarding the competition dates, a draw determined the following: Quarter-finals will be held on February 4th and 5th; semi-finals will be held on February 11th and 12th. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Group A Quarter-Finals</p>
<p>February 4th: South China South vs. Kowloon Club + Jia Hui Lian Shan</p>
<p>February 5th: Eastern Club vs. South China Hua, Hong Kong Club Ground</p>
<p>Group A Semi-Finals</p>
<p>February 11th: South China South or Kowloon Club vs. Eastern Club or Hua Hua, So Kon Po Ground</p>
<p>February 12th: Police Club vs. St. Joseph's, Navy Stadium</p>
<p>Group B Semi-Finals</p>
<p>February 11th: Western Engineering vs. Midu Xi, Kowloon Tsang Ground</p>
<p>February 12th: Public Works Department vs. Shi Team, Hong Kong Club Ground</p>
<p>(2) Discussion of the Li Hua Cup preliminary round event. Investigations show that the competition for the championship has always been limited to four teams: Chinese United, Western Civil Servants Team, Navy Team, and Army United Team. The competition adopts an elimination system. The dates for this year's preliminary round have been set for the 21st and 22nd of this month. The order of matches, determined by draw, is as follows:</p>
<p>January 21st (Saturday): Western Civil Servants United Team vs. Army United Team, Kowloon Club Ground</p>
<p>January 22nd (Sunday): Chinese United Team vs. Navy United Team, Hong Kong Club Ground</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-Port Competition, a letter has been sent to the Philippines, inviting them to send a team to compete during the Lunar New Year period. However, the originally proposed competition dates may need to be changed in the future. This was brought up for discussion. It was decided that a reply from the Philippines should be received first, to see when their team will arrive in Hong Kong, and then a decision will be made. The originally proposed competition dates are as follows:</p>
<p>February 18th (Saturday, Lunar New Year's Eve): Philippines Inter-Port Team vs. Hong Kong Inter-Port Team, Navy Stadium</p>
<p>February 20th (Monday): Philippines Inter-Port Team vs. Chinese United Team, Navy Stadium</p>
<p>February 21st (Tuesday): Philippines Inter-Port Team vs. Hong Kong All-Star Team, Navy Stadium</p>
<p>(4) Discussion of the International Quarter-Finals. This competition will be between China and England. The winner will then play Portugal in the final. The committee members felt that since the South China football team, which is currently on tour in Saigon, has many Chinese national league representatives, it was decided to hand over the determination of the location and dates to the management sub-committee and the opposing team.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the item of 2,028 yuan and 7 cents from the Shao Zerong condolence match, the committee members felt that since Mr. Shao died from injuries, leaving behind an elderly mother and younger sister, whose situation is pitiable, it was unanimously agreed to transfer the full amount to Mr. Shao's family.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Games Last Night: Hong Kong University and Southwest Both Win</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch] After all the homes lit up, a battle unfolded in the basketball hall. According to the schedule, three women's basketball games were originally scheduled to be held last night at the Zijing Gymnasium. The first game was Snowflake vs. Hong Kong University, the second game was Southwest vs. St. Paul's, and the last game was Meifang vs. Sixiang. Later, because Sixiang withdrew from the competition, there were only two games.</p>
<p>Knowing that the performance last night would not be very exciting, fans were few, with the exception of cheerleaders and players, there were very few genuine basketball fans.</p>
<p>The first game was relatively tense and interesting, while the second game was not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>At 6:30, the battle began. Hong Kong University had Wenhua on the front line, who was very active, frequently attacking Snowflake's territory. But at this time, all the generals from Snowflake showed effort. Manhong and Qiao's performance was still acceptable. Until the end of the first quarter, Snowflake led by one point, 6 to 5.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Wenhua's performance was brilliant, and her throws were also very accurate. Moreover, because Zou Defan provided many opportunities for Wenhua, her brilliance was revealed. So, at the end of this quarter, Hong Kong University reversed the situation with a score of 12 to 11, and the situation improved.</p>
<p>In the second half, Snowflake's formation shook, focusing more on defense than offense. On the other hand, Hong Kong University's Wenhua and Defan were very active. After a period of intense competition, 21 to 18, Snowflake was even further behind.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, Snowflake tried desperately to struggle, but could not break the deadlock. Moreover, because everyone was eager to win, their shots were often inaccurate. As a result, they lost 19 to 27.</p>
<p>(Total score: 27)</p>
<p>(Total score: 19)</p>
<p>After the end of the first act, the second game began. After the opening, Ruixin scored first for Southwest, with aggressive momentum, but in a blink of an eye, St. Paul's returned a basket, tying the score. Thereafter, St. Paul's still wanted to work hard, but unfortunately their skills were inferior, and they could only watch Southwest's score continue to increase, while they themselves remained empty-handed. After one quarter, the score was 2 to 16.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second quarter, Southwest, with victory in hand, did not overextend themselves. They brought out Peizhi, Ruixin, etc., and replaced them with Yuechang and Xianghuan. But even after this personnel change, their strength was still much better than St. Paul's. So, after the end of the first half, St. Paul's still inevitably succumbed to a score of 5 to 20.</p>
<p>Both sides made progress in the second half, but St. Paul's had already lost too much ground in the first half, and it was not easy to equalize. In fact, the opportunities for St. Paul's to score were purely due to the generosity of Southwest's generals. Otherwise, it would probably not have been easy to gain anything. At the end of the quarter, 27 to 10, Southwest was far ahead.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, Southwest played solid defense. On the other hand, St. Paul's had many opportunities to throw the ball, but because Wanlian and Man'e's throws were inaccurate, they didn't score much. After that, Southwest's momentum was even stronger, and they frequently made contributions. Ruixin and Peizhi had the skill of hitting almost every shot. Until the end of the entire game, 33 to 12, Southwest cheered and celebrated their victory. (The person under the basket)</p>

<h3>Yang Shuiyi's Wife Abuse Case: Liang Xiuying's Appeal Succeeds; The Decision on Alimony and Separation is Remanded to the Central Magistracy</h3>
<p>Yang Shuiyi, a football star of the South China Athletic Association, was previously sued by his wife, Liang Xiuying, alleging that he had abused her at 15 Schooner Street between November 1937 and June of last year, seeking separation and alimony. The case was dismissed by Magistrate Bi Si of the Central Magistracy. The plaintiff, Liang Xiuying, dissatisfied, hired lawyer Liu Ruilin, who in turn asked lawyer Li Ronggen to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Justices MacKisack and Leong Yip-wing heard the case. After the court opened, the defendant, Yang Shuiyi, did not appear because he had gone to Saigon for a football match. Liu Ruilin's lawyer, Li Gengsheng, testified that he had sent a summons to the defendant and proved that the defendant was aware of this matter. The testimony was accepted.</p>
<p>Barrister Li Spoke on the Appeal</p>
<p>Barrister Li stood up and stated the grounds for the appeal, briefly saying that during the trial of the bill of complaint, it was learned that both parties had married in accordance with Chinese customary rites, which were consistent with the requirements of current Chinese law. This had also been proven by Chinese legal experts, leaving no doubt. Furthermore, the respondent, Yang Shuiyi, also admitted that the appellant was his wife. The judge's reasons for rejecting the request stated that, according to the interpretation of the ordinance, the appellant, Liang Xiuying, was not the respondent's wife. Regarding this point, it is very important for many women in Hong Kong. Because the type of marriage not recognized by the judge as being within the scope of the ordinance is not only practiced by the general Chinese people in Hong Kong, but is also very common in mainland China. The judge seems to have interpreted the 1935 Separation and Maintenance Ordinance as requiring reference to the conditions of 1905. The customary rite above was not practiced in 1905. Therefore, it was also said that it did not exist in 1935. If this is the correct interpretation of the ordinance, I fear that many wives will be deprived of the rights conferred by the ordinance. This seems to forget the original intention of the legislation.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Primary Wife and Concubine is Clear</p>
<p>The legislative intent of the ordinance regarding primary wife and concubine is very clear. I believe that it is merely a matter of rhetorical expression. It refers only to one meaning and does not need to invoke already repealed provisions for mixed interpretation. The ordinance does not limit its application to a specific period, nor does it exclude marriages existing in the year of legislation. In fact, the aforementioned marriage rite is the only rite prescribed by Chinese law. The judge intends to limit the interpretation of the ordinance, basing it on an erroneous assumption, distorting its meaning. This lawyer believes this is indeed wrong. The legislative intent does not limit the interpretation of the word "wife" or "married woman." Furthermore, the ordinance does not stipulate the regulations on marriage, then the relationship of husband and wife exists naturally. The only true test in this case is whether the marriage between the two parties complied with Chinese law and customs. If the answer is yes, then the requirements stipulated in the ordinance have been fully met. After that, Barrister Li said that both parties had married in accordance with the manner prescribed by Chinese law and customs. The judge's decision was erroneous.</p>
<p>Chief Justice's Original Judgment</p>
<p>At this point, Chief Justice MacKisack announced that the appellant's appeal was successful and ordered the respondent, Yang Shuiyi, to bear the costs of the appeal. The decision on alimony and separation was remanded to the Central Magistracy. His judgment briefly stated that since the establishment of the Republic of China, a new style of marriage has been adopted in China. This is recognized by the Chinese Civil Code. In this case, the respondent himself admitted that the appellant was his wife. The judge dismissed the bill of complaint. In his statement on the case, he continued that the two parties had, in fact, married in 1934, and their marital relationship was formed in accordance with the new style of marriage, except that it was not registered with the government. Despite the discovery of these facts, the judge believed that the interpretation of the 1935 Ordinance could not be sought from the Ordinance itself, but must refer to the already repealed 1905 Ordinance. As Barrister Li pointed out, the meaning of the 1935 Ordinance is very clear and unambiguous, and there is no need to cite other evidence. The second question is the matter of not being registered according to law. Although this point was not raised, the reason is quite simple: there is no such registration agency in Hong Kong. However, the judge believed that although there was no such agency, a similar procedure could be carried out at the Marriage Registry of the High Court. This view is obviously wrong, as the two parties could not register. Based on the above, the judge's judgment was legally flawed. According to the last section of his statement on the case, we should now allow the appellant's appeal to succeed. As for the request in this case, it is remanded to the magistracy for decision. The costs of the appeal trial are to be borne by the respondent.</p>

<h3>Training Methods for Track and Field</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuecheng</p>
<p>Imbalance in the development of the body, or excessive development of one part of the muscles, are abnormal phenomena. Track and field athletes should be no different from musicians; their various movements must be harmonious with each other. Not only in the body, but also in the movements, one part cannot be focused on while neglecting others. For example, many field event athletes believe that the best method or most wonderful posture when launching a discus or shot put is that the foot used to support the body weight before the throw, i.e., the rear foot, should cross in front of the other foot. The drawback of this erroneous view is that it causes some field event athletes to focus too much on this movement, and they are eager to move their rear foot in front of the other foot, so that both feet jump up at the same time before the discus or shot put leaves their hand, leaving the ground. Thus, the body is suspended in the air, and the body and arm are not supported by the legs. It should be noted that the powerful thrust or throwing ability of the arm must rely on the shoulders and back, as well as the hips and legs. The body must be supported on the ground; otherwise, even with a strong arm, excellent results cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>In throwing the shot put, etc., the action of exchanging the positions of the feet is actually Newton's Third Law of Motion: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." The action of exchanging the positions of the feet is also due to the shift of the body's center of gravity.</p>
<p>Also, such as in high jump and pole vault, many athletes only focus on the body twist and the body extension posture when practicing high jump, and also only focus on the action of pulling the body up when practicing pole vault. They think that this is the key to success. As a result, those high jump athletes neglect the correct and powerful stabbing and jumping action, and sometimes also twist their body too early, thus hindering the jumping action and not being able to jump with full force. Similarly, those pole vault athletes also disregard the running or sprinting, jumping, and body ascending actions, and only focus on the action of hoisting and supporting the body. In fact, if the running, sprinting, jumping, etc. actions are done correctly, it is not difficult to have a correct and wonderful posture on the high jump bar, and the action of pulling the body up can also be correct and powerful. If the body is hoisted up prematurely, it will not only make the body unable to turn properly but will also affect the strength of the abdomen.</p>
<p>The main reason for forming this concept is the photos taken of famous athletes' running, high jumping, and throwing shot put postures. Those photos have actually ruined many promising young athletes. Many think that this is the correct posture, or the key to success. For example, in racing, most photos are taken of the situation when crossing the finish line. It should be noted that when we reach the finish line, we have already spent a lot of energy. The body must be very tired, and we must also exert all our strength to make the final struggle. Therefore, we cannot maintain the correct posture, even the most famous athletes cannot avoid this. Their victory is not in that moment. Most of what we see in the photos is not the key to their success. For example, when a high jump athlete breaks a record, some photographers often ask him to perform the high jump posture again. But the height jumped is far below the height when he broke the record. After the photo is taken, the general public thinks that this is the key to the success of that record-breaking athlete, so they all imitate this posture. It should be noted that not only is the key to the success of that high jump athlete not in that moment, but also his posture when he performs is not exactly the same as his posture when he broke the record. As for low hurdles, high hurdles, long jump, and javelin throwing, when an athlete jumps up or sprints, most photographers like to squat down to photograph his posture. Such photos cannot be used as a reference material, because in such photos, we only see the angle of the body, and what we see is not the original angle of the body when the athlete is high jumping or sprinting. On the one hand, because those photographers often squat down when taking pictures, and on the other hand, the camera is often tilted. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment…The Corsair of Algfers</p>
<p>Algfers</p>
<p>The story's background is a mysterious and bizarre place, described as being like something out of "Arabian Nights." The place is called Algiers, which is now a territory of France. One part of the city is quite modern, but the other part, inhabited by indigenous people, still completely retains the mysterious colors of ancient East. There, lawlessness reigns, and thieves and desperados gather. The director handles this backdrop to the utmost of eerie and murderous ability, further embroidering it with a moving story. The treacherous and brutal actions of the bandits fill every inch of the photo with a mysterious, terrifying, and intensely stimulating power.</p>
<p>The story narrates how an international jewel thief, fleeing for his life, mixes in this place. Betrayal by his accomplices and encirclement by detectives are all cunningly evaded by him. However, he loses his life because of falling for a beautiful French girl.</p>
<p>Charles Boyer gives a very profound performance of the bandit's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, the female lead who acted in "Ecstasy", also delivers excellent acting. Xue Li Jiali, in her first film, "The Travels of Marco Polo," left us with an excellent impression when she played Kublai Khan's daughter. In this film, she fully and wholeheartedly embodies a native girl passionately in love with the jewel thief, and her outstanding acting deserves our special praise.</p>
<p>Queen…Wings of the Navy</p>
<p>Men Wfth Wfngs</p>
<p>The entire film narrates the evolution of American aviation over the past thirty to forty years, and can also be said to be a systematic narrative of humanity's conquest of space. At the same time, we must acknowledge that this is one of the greatest and most valuable works in film history.</p>
<p>The story seems to draw on too broad a range of material, resulting in a lengthy plot that feels somewhat lacking in dramatic power. However, various tense and thrilling scenes completely mask this shortcoming. For example, flight accidents, aerial dogfights, life-and-death test flights, and the daring feat of the first transatlantic crossing – these are all extremely stimulating scenes. At the same time, women who are worried and sobbing – these are all capable of manipulating the audience's emotions.</p>
<p>The use of color in this film could not be more appropriate. The various brightly colored airplanes soaring in the blue sky filled with colorful clouds enhance the audience's aesthetic appreciation.</p>
<p>The performances of Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland are both extremely refined. The female lead, Loretta Young, is a rising star who has not received much attention. In this film, we discover that she is a highly promising talent.</p>
<p>Ping An…The Spy Ring</p>
<p>The Soy Ring</p>
<p>A spy film with nothing much to recommend it. The writers and directors failed to adequately develop the spies' activities and dangerous conspiracies, and forcibly inserted polo matches and some humorous scenes, piecing together a disjointed film.</p>
<p>The story narrates how a group of international spies operate in the United States, attempting to steal the blueprints for a newly invented anti-aircraft weapon. However, due to the inventor's courage and cleverness, their cunning plan is thwarted. The acting of each cast member is also very mediocre.</p>
<p>Eastern…Flash Gordon</p>
<p>Flash Gordon</p>
<p>A foreign fantasy film, relying on scientific ideals to create various strange things and inserting a story of heroes and beauties, is of no practical value. It only caters to the appetites of those who harbor curiosity.</p>
<p>Dahua—Blockade</p>
<p>Blockade</p>
<p>This is a film depicting the activities of traitors during wartime, but on the other hand, it exposes the cruelty of war. This is a point that the author particularly emphasizes. The director uses very lively shots to reveal the various vicious methods of bombing and blockades. Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll also give decent performances.</p>
<p>Jingxing…Sing Your Sinners</p>
<p>Sing Your Sinners</p>
<p>A musical film interspersed with humor, with plenty of laughs. The horse racing scene is both tense and hilarious. Starring Bing Crosby and Fred MacMurray.</p>
<p>Central…Woman</p>
<p>Mandarin Film</p>
<p>The concept of adapting a silent film from three years ago into a full-fledged talkie is very correct. The screenwriter is entirely appealing for the pain that women have suffered for thousands of years, which people have not understood. Overall, it is not necessarily more advanced than the silent film version, but the dialogue is more lively. The new actress, Lu Ming, and the other actors all give outstanding performances.</p>
<p>New World…Good Daughter Marries Eighteen Times Sequel</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Is "Wheat and Soldiers" Worth Reading?</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>I read Lou Zuojun's book review of "Wheat and Soldiers" on the 7th in "Constellation" and was quite surprised. On the 8th, in "Free Talk," I read Mr. Lin Youru's book review of "Wheat and Soldiers" and found it to be "a good work." Mr. Lin said:</p>
<p>"Japanese fascist literary 'critics' such as Xianye Akira have pointed out the failure of Japanese 'war literature' in recent years, saying, 'Works that were considered remarkable in the Japanese literary world were translated and published in Chinese newspapers and magazines, and when Chinese people read them, they were simply good materials for anti-Japanese and insulting-Japan [sentiments].' Indeed, we also feel this way after reading "Wheat and Soldiers," which is still very popular in Japan. (!) It is not only good material for 'anti-Japanese' and 'insulting-Japan' sentiments, but also does a good job of publicizing our war of resistance!"</p>
<p>Lou Zuojun first said:</p>
<p>"...But what is worth mentioning is that there are two more noteworthy works. One is Ishikawa Tatsuzo's "Living Soldiers," and the other is "Wheat and Soldiers," which is the subject of this article."</p>
<p>Then said:</p>
<p>"However, this book still has a certain value, because it objectively records the difficulties of combat, the encounters during the journey, the bravery of the Chinese, and the fragility of the Japanese army, within a certain range. And because of this objective narrative, we can at least have a further understanding of the sacred war of resistance for the survival of the Chinese people."</p>
<p>The views of the two people, the tone of the two people, are exactly the same. I dare not compliment such opinions.</p>
<p>It is true that "Wheat and Soldiers" is "still very popular in Japan." No, it is simply the most popular novel with the theme of the Sino-Japanese War. Perhaps our "translators" were blinded by this fact, and at the same time, they saw a few places in the book that "objectively recorded the events of the war within a certain range," and forgot the comparative level of the value of the good and bad aspects.</p>
<p>"Wheat and Soldiers" is under the absolute control of speech by the Japanese warlords. Why is it so popular? I wonder if anyone believes it. Is it because it exposes "the bravery of the Chinese soldiers and the fragility of the Japanese"? I wonder if anyone believes it. Is it because it "did a good job of publicizing our war of resistance"? I myself do not believe it. Mr. Lin Youru said:</p>
<p>"The author, Hino Ashihei, is considered a typical figure in the 'Imperial Army.'"</p>
<p>Lou Zuojun also said:</p>
<p>"Hino Ashihei is a typical patriotic figure, the crystallization of decades of military-national education. He is unclear about the purpose of participating in the war, and also believes that war is an inevitable fact."</p>
<p>Hino Ashihei also confessed in "Author's Words":</p>
<p>"In this grand war concept, everything unknowingly becomes blind."</p>
<p>Can such a person write a work that "does a good job of publicizing our war of resistance"?</p>
<p>Colonel Sato, the director of the Army Ministry's Intelligence Department, criticized this work, saying:</p>
<p>"...Generally speaking, the misery and sorrow of war make the author's emotions run high and his rationality blind. His writing tends to become an anti-war narrative; but the author of "Wheat and Soldiers" is not like that. When emotions run high, he can still revive his rational power of reflection... Transcending life and death, he directly analyzes the sense of responsibility and obligation for victory in war, which is expressed in his simple work. This is one of its characteristics. Another characteristic is the skillful depiction of the vast and boundless wheat field as the background, which can skillfully reconcile the sense of reality of the terrain with the warriors fighting in the summer battlefields, and comprehensively unfold the appearance of the front line battlefield to the rear nationals who do not know the real scene of the battlefield."</p>
<p>The Japanese military is making its best efforts to publicize this work and make it a tool for national spiritual mobilization. Its popularity is mainly due to this, but our "book critics" call it "doing a good job of publicizing our war of resistance" and praise it as being on par with "Living Soldiers"! What can I say?</p>
<h3>The Distance Between Two Eras</h3>
<p>— Mengqi</p>
<p>Last night, I received the news of my father's death. At that time, I was stunned for a long time, and I felt as if my nerves were paralyzed from top to toe. I couldn't tell whether it was grief or bitterness!</p>
<p>Speaking of my father's death, it was my fault. In my understanding, it was not "sudden." When I was running around in the Shaanxi and Sichuan roads, I learned the news of my father's illness. At that time, I really felt "a mixture of joy and fear." What I was happy about was that father was finally safe in the human world. What I was afraid of was that my father had always been strong, and even if he felt a little uncomfortable, he would often force himself to endure it and would not admit to being sick. Now that he was willing to send the news of his illness, it showed that the situation was serious. So, on the one hand, I hurried on the road, and on the other hand, I sent a long letter home to inquire about the situation in detail. By the time I had exhausted myself to reach Chengdu, the reply from home had been waiting for a long time at the friend's place where the letter was being forwarded. As soon as I opened it, I knew that the situation was not good, because I could tell at a glance that it was not my father's handwriting. My father was the most prolific writer. No matter where I went, as long as the contact address was determined, he would never fail to send a letter a week, and each letter was always detailed and meticulous, and his instructions to me were particularly thorough and sincere. I remember deeply that when I was in Guizhou, because I wrote the letter a little too briefly, I was severely scolded by my father, who said not to write telegraphic letters. In the end, I was moved by my father's diligent writing, and I did not dare to be too lazy in writing letters home. My father, the happier he was, the more letters he sent. The frequency and length of his letters almost became a measure of his physical and mental health. Now that we are so far apart and have been separated for so long, he asked someone to write a letter for him, so I shuddered to know how serious my father's illness was.</p>
<p>After arriving in Chongqing, from the intermittent letters from relatives and friends and the person who wrote the letter for him, I learned that my father had been ill in bed for two months. At first, he was too worried about us who were away from home, which led to disordered eating, which eventually became chronic heart weakness. My father was originally in the countryside of ××. He asked the local doctor to diagnose and treat him, but it was of no avail. Later, my mother saw that the illness was not right and tried her best. Moved into the city. When Chinese and Western doctors were consulted, they had already expressed that they were helpless, so he lingered on, tossing and turning, and dragging on for more than four months!</p>
<p>I still don't know what kind of disease my father was suffering from. I saw in one letter that my father was delirious for a few days and wanted to find me. When someone stopped him, he wanted to hit them. Because of my unfilial conduct, my father was so worried that he became mentally disordered. How could this not make me feel bone-piercing pain?</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Moving Mountains and Filling the Sea</h3>
<p>— Fei Zhi</p>
<p>There is an ancient Chinese story that is as famous as "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains." Needless to say, that is "Jingwei Fills the Sea." Literati often cite this story, just like they cite "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," to encourage people to persevere and to talk about the principle of "where there's a will, there's a way."</p>
<p>In fact, these two stories are somewhat different after all. The purpose of the Foolish Old Man is to move the mountain in front of his door, relying on the continuous manpower, "When I die, I will have a son, and the son will have a grandson, and the grandson will have a son, and the manpower will not increase, so why worry that the mountain will not be leveled?" Indeed, it is possible to use unlimited manpower to move a limited mountain, and it is necessary to persist for a long time.</p>
<p>Filling the sea is different. Dutch engineers have also failed at times, which shows that it is a very difficult task. Even if a small island by the sea moves "the wood and stones of the Western Mountain" into the sea day and night, the fluctuating seawater will always move its "wood and stones" elsewhere. What it wants to fill is the "East Sea," but the "wood and stones" may not have been put into the "East Sea" at all. No matter how hard you work, it is still a waste of effort. Persistence is also useless.</p>
<p>Therefore, "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" and "Jingwei Fills the Sea," although both are equally persevering, the former is doing what is known to be possible, while the latter is doing what is known to be impossible. There is also a certain limit to the truth of "where there's a will, there's a way." Do we have to snatch the moon from the sky? If we have the will and the forgetfulness, then can we "succeed"?</p>
<p>Of course, doing what is known to be impossible is the spirit of the great sages, which is worth promoting and respecting. However, this spirit is the great sages' determination to save the world, so it is worth respecting. If we use this spirit in another place, our evaluation of him will be different.</p>
<p>For example, negotiating "peace" with ×, colluding with × people, selling out national interests, and selling out national history, this is what the 450 million Chinese people who are fighting will oppose to the death. Whoever does this will be beaten and killed by the Chinese people. If a person just wants to do this and feels that it is impossible, and therefore stops, he is still a good man. On the contrary, if he does what he knows to be impossible for the sake of personal "sweetness," he will immediately be severely judged by the public and will have nowhere to escape!</p>
<h3>Night Crossing</h3>
<p>— Xin Ding</p>
<p>The warm air of the day has disappeared, replaced by a cold sea breeze. The wanderer in thin clothes, filled with the fatigue of a day's work, as usual, stepped onto the huge ferry, bidding farewell to the brightly lit island of the South, and sailing towards the misty opposite shore in the night.</p>
<p>The narrow three-cabin ferry is like an iron cage selling pigs and dogs. People are crowded together, dark and black. Vendors selling marinated food, oranges, and crispy peanuts are flowing like shuttles through the crowd, shouting loudly. The doctor selling Jianghu medicine is touting his unique "effective for all diseases" medicine. This symphony of all aspects of society is playing. Playing, it disturbed the wanderer's heart who wanted to get a moment of peace, and interrupted the loner's meditation from time to time.</p>
<p>The cold sea breeze, in a harsh and尖酸manner, drilled into the gaps of the single clothes, and the only thing that answered it was the sound of the ship's side hitting the waves.</p>
<p>Looking at the island in the distance, the rows of lights and electric tubes emit brilliant light in the coastal buildings; however, hidden in this light are the charming smiles that are sold as commodities, and the decadence and decay of the soul that has been drained from the body; there are the blood and sweat that have been shed for the development of the barren island, and the hidden shouts of resistance to exploitation and pressure. Oh, isn't the line of street lights crossing the mountain top the torch of the anti-× demonstration parade? This torch will never be extinguished, and will forever illuminate the 450 million people, fighting for justice and freedom all the way to victory.</p>
<p>On the ferry, carrying hundreds of passengers who were eager to return home, even though they were also burdened with heavy fatigue, or worried about the food for their family of several people tomorrow, the expressions on their faces were all uniformly facing their destination. And I—this single guest who wandered from the war zone to the island, I don't know if there are any friends who have a light relationship with me tonight, who are willing to keep me for one night?</p>
<p>Tomorrow... I thought of tomorrow in the darkness. Tomorrow is bright. Tomorrow there is the roar of our thousands of brothers. Tomorrow we will see the demons running away at our feet! I will entrust all my hope to tomorrow. However, the night crossing released a calm, loud and bright whistle in the dark bay. It ruthlessly broke my reverie and forced me to face the serious reality... Go back to your motherland tomorrow, don't be foolish here!</p>
<p>The bright light on the island gradually faded away in the turbulent waves. Those sailing ships that are preparing to go out to sea to fish tomorrow are hanging a flashing light on the mast!</p>
<h3>Raising Funds by Gambling</h3>
<p>— Yan Lianyi</p>
<p>A certain film company was charged for gambling. When the defendant Zhao was interrogated yesterday, he confessed: "This gathering of people to play was at the request of a certain comfort group, in order to raise funds to relieve refugees." Whether the confession is true or not is not discussed for the time being. However, raising funds by gambling is not a good topic after all. These four words are really a bit absurd when they are put together!</p>
<p>Of course, gambling is illegal, while raising funds is a good deed. Therefore, the two things are absolutely contradictory. Whether it is permitted by law to gamble for the purpose of raising funds is another question. However, we can learn from the inspiration of this incident that many people are making a fortune under the name of "raising funds."</p>
<p>Those who are good at Ge Li often skillfully seize the rare opportunity to grab a moving name and make a fortune. In the process of this war of resistance, many cold-blooded animals that make a fortune from the national crisis have been produced, and now, some people are making a fortune from refugees.</p>
<p>Really, if "raising funds" can be achieved by "gambling," there will be newer tricks that will be staged one after another, that's for sure. For example, raising funds by selling drugs, raising funds by robbery... wouldn't that also be legal?</p>
<p>But then again, we should support those who enthusiastically respond to the movement. However, I hope that everyone should raise funds for the sake of raising funds, not for the sake of making a fortune! At the same time, especially do not use unscrupulous means to respond to the fundraising.</p>
<h3>Serving the Era and the Environment</h3>
<p>— Chen Shihhuai</p>
<p>Reality is complex and multifaceted, and it is also harsh and ruthless.</p>
<p>Indeed, the war has awakened and inspired the creative power of many literary and artistic workers. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, weren't there many writers who held a front-lineist view, wishing they could replace their pens with guns? It is true that they were a bit impetuous. However, there is such a rare phenomenon in our literary world, which can be regarded as a great continuation. For this war of national liberation, we are participating as a practitioner—not an observer. We grew up in this great era, and we have also witnessed those heroic historical events that make people cry and inspire people. Our encounters can be said to be the Asian luck. The question of "why great works cannot be produced" that was raging in the past can always be resolved now, I think. What is placed in front of writers is not a pile of bloody epics that are the most glorious and moving in the history of human struggle? I dare say that today's China should be an era that produces great works like the Soviet Union's "The Iron Flood" and "The Rout."</p>
<p>Gorky said: "As a writer who is a person of a certain environment and era, no matter what his intentions and conditions are, he must serve his era and environment." That's right, our writers should use their pens to "mobilize the people to defend the motherland." How courageous the anti-Japanese soldiers are, and how vile the invaders are, can all be depicted by our talented pens. The question is how to avoid the "formulaic," "vulgar," "slogan-like," and "propagandistic" aspects that are criticized by people. As long as you remember the saying "literature is the most jealous ugly woman," you can understand that those who engage in literary work with a mercenary heart or even a fluke heart will eventually decline. Therefore, the call for "realistic anti-Japanese war literature" does not seem meaningless. We explain it this way: "The subjective and objective aspects of realism are unified. The writer's worldview and creative method are inseparable." Many of our writers with a sense of justice, whether in the front line or the rear, are using realistic creative methods. We continue to receive many reports from writers who have witnessed the front line. Regardless of their form, whether they are short communications, folk songs, or ditties, as long as those are artistic and figurative works, we can consider them to be "realistic anti-Japanese war literature."</p>
