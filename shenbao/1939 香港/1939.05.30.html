<h3>歴史的教訓</h3>
<p>『前事不忘、後者之師』，人類歷史的最大意義，就在以我們祖先或前驅者的經驗與教訓，指示我們奮鬥前進，以達人生最理想的幸福之途。我們中國人民中華民族今日所追求的，主要的是驅逐正在脅迫我走上滅亡之途的臼本侵略者，是從日×的壓迫，刼掠，姦淫，××，屠殺，×××××之下，爭取全體中國人民中華民族的解放——獨文，自由，平等，幸福。</p>
<p>在我們的歷史上，不少這種求解放的鬥爭，並且留下了非常珍貴的勝利的先例，和非常珍貴的經騐與教訓。特別是在中山先生迎合着一『五四運動』的怒潮，而實現了國民黨的激底改組以後，在中山先生接受全部人類歷史所有解放運動的經騐教訓和針對國際與國內情勢及需要而手創了三民主義和决定了建國大綱以後，一九二五年的今天的中華民族解放運動，這次運動曾經使全世界一新耳目，以驚羨的眼光來看我東方的重光和中國的新生，而我們自己則至今囘想起來，還不禁心躍血沸，對於目前進行着的解放運動，增加了無限的勇氣和勝利信心。</p>
<p>一九二五年的今天的民族解放運動，這次奠定了中國革命建國事業之勝利基礎的運動，其最重要與偉大的意義，便是中華民族聯合戰綫之第一次在羣衆運動中具體地表現出來；並且在北伐的前夜，在沸騰全國的求解放的怒潮澎湃之時，每一城市的民族解放運動，不僅學生，工人農民以至民族資產者，都熱烈地參加了，而因工商學聯合會的正式成立與展開工作，更成爲第一次在中國出現的民衆的聯合戰綫的組織形式，由於這一民族聯合戰綫的偉大的力量，不僅表現了中國靑年學生特別是工人廣民在民族解放運動中的偉大的力量，而且也表現了民族資產者同樣是抗×救國的重要勢力。同時因有當時革命的政黨對於這一運動的堅持和正確的領導，才使這運動獲得廣泛的深入的開展。這是我們今日所要深刻自省的第一個歷史的教訓。</p>
<p>目前中華民族解放運動爭求獨立自由平等幸福的抗戰建國事業，正在進入一個新的嚴重階段，我們現在更應該鄭重認淸十四年前之今日的千萬人的熱血頭顱換來的勝利底經驗和挫敗底教訓：我們要學習勝利的經騐，第一是要更加鞏固中國各民族各階層各黨派的團結，擴大全中華民族抗戰建國的聯合戰線。但是目前我們的共同×人日本侵略者，正在走上他們在十四年前的「勝利之路』，正在改以政治的進攻爲主，配合惟軍事的進攻，而傾力於維持其與中國一切封建殘餘，腐欺勢力頑固份子的勾結，傾力於勾引中國的漢奸，叛徒，動搖與守舊份子，利用『反共」『和平』『日滿支協同體』『東亞新秩序』等烟幕與毒氣，來分裂我抗戰建國的民族聯合戰線，來強化其中國佔領區的統治，刦掠，和壓榨，用這些新攻略來解救其侵華戰爭所引起的內外困難與危機，而準備征服全中國與獨霸東亞的新步驟！因此我們還要接受十四年前挫敗的教訓，要和日×挑撥離間分裂分化我全民族各黨派團結的一切陰謀毒計，作堅持的戰鬥；要和漢好叛徒，動搖與守舊份子的一切違反中央抗戰建國政策的言論行動，作堅持的戰鬥。</p>
<p>當×人遭遇到不可挽救的打擊的前夕，當漢奸叛徒遭遇到不可躲閃的制裁的前夕，牠們是會運用一切不堪想象的殘酷與惡毒的陰謀的！目前也許就是這個時候了！讓我們用更大的决心與堅持去加以致命的打擊吧！最後勝利就要在這種打擊的完成之後降臨到我們面前！</p>
<h3>抗戰建國與國民道德的修養</h3>
<p>— 劉海鷗</p>
<p>一　中日戰爭爆發的原因</p>
<p>以一九一四至一八年聞的第一次世界大戰爲楔子，中日兩國的歷史便向着相反的方向發展。臼本利用歐戰的機會，把自己加速度推到了「最後階段」，從此內在的矛盾，就一天天地增加，她的命運只是在黑晤中模索，全沒有光明的前途了。</p>
<p>中國，相反地，利用歐戰的機會，奠定了薄弱的民族工業基礎。中國人民爲革命信念所驅使，緊隨着民挨資本的發展，而先後發生了一九一九年的反封建的「五四」運動，和一九二六年國民革命軍的『北伐』。那時，中國已得到了自力更生的機會，產生了中國歷史向上發展的原動力。</p>
<p>歐戰以後，日本帝國主義內在的危機漸次地增加，爲了解决這危機，便於一九三一年九月十八日，突然佔領了中國的遼寗，以至全部的東北四省的土地。由於冒險嘗試的成功，牠反映於日本政治上的：第二是政黨政治的沒落，和軍部的抬頭。第二是軍需工業佔主要成分的財閥們，羣起而爲軍部的後盾。臼本軍部從此就一變而爲時代的願兒，視中國爲無人。視中華民族爲　肉了。</p>
<p>然而，日本帝國主義的對華侵略愈是加緊，中國內部的團結也益發堅固，九一八以後「精誠團結，共赴國難」的口號，也就普及於全國，抗戰的力量也就集中了。但日本的侵略，漫無止境，自塘沽協定之後，中國仍持忍辱負重，和日本周旋，停止軍事行動，用和平的方法，先謀北方各省的保全，再進而謀東北四省問題的合理解决，在政治上以保持主權及行政的完整；在經濟上以互惠平等爲合作的原則。但日本帝國主義，昧於世界的時代潮流，在這「民族自决」和　「民族主義」怒潮澎湃的今日，妄想以七千萬人口的國家，要來吞滅我四萬萬五千萬人口的中國。終於　九三七年七月突然以武力進攻蘆溝橋，佔領我平津，中國生命所繫的一線生機，至此已到了絕續存亡的關頭，興其坐而待亡，不如起而抗戰，從死中求生存，　於是中國歷史上所未有的民族抗戰，便如火如荼地爆發了。</p>
<p>二　抗戰建國的意義</p>
<p>中國這次抗戰的目的，在於抵禦日本帝國主義的侵略，以救國家民挨的垂亡；同時於抗戰之中，加緊工作，以完成建國的任務，爲什麽要抗戰建國同時並進？在廿七年四月一日中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會宣言中，已有如此的昭示：</p>
<p>『吾人此次抗戰，固在救亡，尤在使建國大常不致中斷。且建國大業必非俟抗戰勝利之後，重行開始，乃在抗戰之中爲不斷之進行，吾人必須於抗戰之中，集合全國之人力物力，以同赴一的，深植建國之基礎，然後抗戰勝利之日，卽建國大業吿成之成之日，亦卽中國自由平等之日也。……蓋非抗戰，則民族之生存獨立且不可保，自無以遂建國大業之進行：而非建國則自力不能充實，將何以禦外侮，以求得最後之勝利』。</p>
<p>我們只要能究心於三民主義之最高指導原理，那麽抗戰建國二者之相資相輔以相底於成，是必然的道理。這次抗戰是全國心力物力的總動員，也是全國心力物力之總决賽，所以我們必須有如下之努力：</p>
<p>（一）集中民力——在這抗戰期間，吾人必須認識：惟有本於民埃主義，以發揚民族的固有道德，恢復民族的自信力，合四萬萬五千萬之心爲一心，堅如金石，這樣民力才可集中，抗戰力量始可充實。</p>
<p>（二）發展民力——抗戰的勝敗，不僅取决於兵力，尤其取决於民力，所以吾們必須組織民衆，訓練民衆。組織訓練的目的，在養成民衆自衛能力和自治能力，這兩樣有同一的重要性，沒有自衛能力，那麼自治無發揚滋長的餘地：沒有自治能力，那麽自衛必失卻憑籍了。在這抗戰期間，我們必須本民權主義的精神，來組訓民衆，然後民衆之自衛力和自治力才可發展，這也就是民力的發展了。</p>
<p>（三）充實民力——抗戰是心力物力的總動員，總决賽，前已言之。要發展物力，充實物力，我們對於農工商業，必須一面加以調節，一面加以發展，以奠定抗戰建國的經濟基礎，具體地說：一，全國民衆應當極端的節約，極端的刻苦，累積生產資本，振興實業。二，我們一切農業復興的計劃，都要以抗戰爲前提。三，經濟建設，政府根據民生主義的信條，施行計劃經濟。以上三點，政府和人民，如能統力合作，一一實行，抗戰的力量，便就充實了。</p>
<p>我們以三民主義爲抗戰建國的最高指導原則，並且要身體而力行，克服困難，向前邁進，則抗戰必勝，建國必成，是勢所必然的。</p>
<p>三　抗戰建國與國民道德的修養</p>
<p>抗戰建國最後而最主要的决定條件，便是國民道德的問題了。國民道德所表現出來的，就是國民精神　，牠的重要性是怎樣？蔣委昌長說：「我們革命軍與反革命軍鬥爭，被侵略國與侵略國的軍隊作戰，一定要有特別的革命精神，來抵抗外敵橫暴武力與優裕的物質。」「蓋精神爲萬事成功之母，抗戰建國之原動力」。「而抗戰勝負，全在於精神」。</p>
<p>所謂革命精神，卽是「成亡」「成物」的精神。「成亡」是包含着：「好學」「自強」「謙虛」「創造」「進取」的精神「成物」是包含着：「創造」「服務」「進取」「犧牲」「奮鬥」的精神。以上的八種精神是從「智」「仁」「勇」三者發生出來的。『「智」「仁」「勇」三者，天下之達德也。』所以我們提出的所謂國民道德問題，顯然地也就是「智仁勇」三者的問題，現在分別加以探討：</p>
<p>（一）「智」的意義，是以天賦的聰（耳的靈敏）明（目的靈敏），容（意的靈敏）。知（心的靈敏）的機能，由三種途徑而得來的：第一是生而知之，這種知是由于「先天」而來的。第二是「學而知之」這種是由「學問」而來的，第三是「困而知之」，這種是由經驗而來的。但是「生而知之」的，究竟是極少數的人，這是所謂得天獨學的人了。大多數的人是需要學問而後知的，講到學問，並不是容易的，必須好學困學而後成功，所謂好學近乎智，便是說明求知必須好學，其次求知必謙虛，就是所謂「盧懷若谷」因謂「天下之至盧，天下之至誠也」，能誠方能虛心，能虛心才能求進步！</p>
<p>「智」的目的是什麼呢？第一依據客觀的條件，和主觀的認識，來判斷是非，所以說：「是非之心，智之端也」第二是知「仁」，就是明白做人的道理，這個做人的道理，就是以創造和服務的人生觀，來求事業的成功，也就是成物，所以說：「成物智也」。</p>
<p>我們對於「智」的修養若能善及同，更能深　。則對抗戰建國之認識即清，信念益篤，其必勝必成，絕無疑義。</p>
<p>（二）「仁」包含「創造精神」和「服務精神」，由「創造精神」而「愛物」，由「服務精神」而「仁民」，這就所謂：「仁民而愛物」。「惻隱之心，仁之端也」。又「仁」是一種積極的行動，所以說：「力行近乎仁」。這種積極的行動，目的在乎「威物」，即是求事業的成功，否則雖犧牲一切，亦在所不惜，所以　總理說：「不成功，即成仁」。文天祥說「孔曰成仁，孟曰取義，惟其義盡，所以仁至」。因爲要成物，就不得不犧牲小已，以爲大羣，所以「殺身以成仁」，現在　×當前，同胞之被屠殺，土地之被侵佔，主權之被侵奪，民族國家覆亡的慘痛，已如永深火熱，我們再不能須臾忍受，當此福禍開頭，我們爲求抗戰建國的成功（成物）。必須努力創造，努力服務，最後以至殺身以成仁（成已）。毋求生以害，仁。「國民若無此仁愛之心，則必流於殘忍，賣於自的　　，　則竉兵肢武，歸則偷生苟活。視口家民族之存亡，會不以動其念，個人人格已不存在，國家元氣因以喪失，何以抗戰，何以建國」（臨時代表大會官言）國民滅能以「仁」的條養，厚加之意，躬行實踐，則人心即振，風氣蔚成，抗戰建國，便有必成必勝的把握了。</p>
<p>（三）「勇」是包含着進取的精神，犧牲的精神，和奮鬥的精神。本着這三種精神而去做義（成巳成物）的事情，就是勇，故日「見義勇爲」。日本帝國主義的對華侵略，是我們的奇恥大辱，我們知道這恥辱，于是當起抗戰，這就是「勇」，故日：一知恥近乎勇一。又曰：「明恥教戰」。同胞們！起來本着進取，犧牲，奮鬥的精神，努力於雪恥抗戰，建國工作。</p>
<p>「智仁勇三者，天下之達德也，所以行之者一也，一者誠也。……誠之者，擇善而固執之者也。同胞們　劉此厚創之意，則全國心力物力，自可充實抗戰建國，自可操必勝必成之券了。</p>
<h3>當前青年的出路問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 馮文彬講</p>
<p>（二）　西安特約航信</p>
<p>這一點孫中山先生，在沒有去世以前就預先答覆了。他說：「在漢族沒有光復以前，一般黨人的心理。以爲漢族一經光復，便可據到國利民福的目的。到了今天，才知道是大大的不然。推究這個原因，就是出於當時同志僅僅知道在意民族主義，忽略了民權主義和民生主義的過錯，這個過錯，也正是本黨責任沒有終了的地方。要知道民　主義和民生主義不能貫澈，就是民族主義達到了目的，終久是不能穩固；何況民族主義在今日還沒有完全達到目的呢！」所以他肯定的說：「要解决民族問題，同時不能不解决民權問題；要解决民權問題，同時不能不解决民生問題。」</p>
<p>蔣委員長也曾經說過，「三民主義是整個的，不能雊支離割拆的；中國國民革命運動也不是一民主義的革命，是三民主義同時推進的革命。」</p>
<p>抗戰建國綱領所以規定保障民權，正是從三民主義的前提所廳該得到的結論。但是也有人曲解它，說它所規定的只是法令的權，不是人民的權，因爲它保障民權只在法令範圍內，而法令是可以伸縮自由的。這種意見也是錯誤的。如果各級政府不論人民的思想信仰是否違反三民主義的最高原則，愛保陣就保障，不愛保障就取締，這只是玩弄法令的城信和尊嚴。一切法令必需遵守三民主義的原則，才是正確的法令，要是各　政府可以隨時隨地隨意的制定法令，隨意的判定定人民的合法非法，那末我們要抗戰建國綱領還有什麼意義呢？</p>
<p>第三個條件，我們有富富的歷史教訓。我門的先聖者賢老早就吿訢我們：「兄弟閱於　，外禦其侮。」　蚌相爭，箕豆相煎，向來　我們看做最大的愚蠢。我們不但自幼就受這種優良的民族傳統的熏陶，並且　　自身的經驗中間證明了它的正確。</p>
<p>從五四以來，中國靑年已經有了二十年奮鬥歴史。二十年來的寶貴經驗證明了團結就是幸　，而分裂是災禍。勝利的記憶和痛苦的創傷對我們都還很新鮮，我們已經懂得了求得團結避免分裂的必要，我們也學習了不少求得團結避免分裂的實際辦法。</p>
<p>第四個條件，我們受到許多本國的長輩和國外的朋友的幇助，中央和各地的軍政長宜，各抗臼黨派的領袖，各界年高望重的先進人士，他們對我們靑年的提攜愛護指示誘導，是我們所終身銘感的。國際靑年統一戰絲在許多，面給一我們中國青年很好的榜樣。英、法、美等國的青年，都在反戰反法西斯蒂的共同目標下走向統一，各國的靑年，對於中國靑年統一戰綫是很關心的。兩次世界靑年大　力召集，世界事聯代表團的來華，對於我們的團結統一，都發生了顯著的推進作用。</p>
<p>第六，我們有矢忠于靑年統一戰線的靑年幹部。我們靑年團體中的這些幹部具有政治上的敏感和遠見，具有各種必要的才能和毅力。幾乎在無論什麼地方，我們的幹部都能走在一般靑年的前面，都能做一般靑年的益友。當一般靑年疲倦和苦悶的時候，我們的幹部就加以有力的鼓勵，一般靑年迷失方向的時候，我們的幹部就給以堅定明確的指示。他們的全部的精力都實獻到青年統一戰綫上來了。在我們　　專中閩，這樣的人的名字我們可以舉出　千　　，他們是先天下之憂而憂，　天下之　而　的人，只　對於青年團結抗戰的事業有　助，他們不怕任何　　和　　。這是我們青年隊伍事無上的光疑。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>最後，我們青年統一戰線　一一個優點，就是我們青年都很坦白復純潔，沒有什麼世故成見，我們　到什麼話應該說的就說，想到什麼　　　做的做，對於個人的利害看得很輕。我們對於教國救　的工作大家都很熱心的，這就使得我們復自然的團結起來。</p>

<h3>蘭州勝蹟（上）</h3>
<p>— 君邃</p>
<p>新疆紀行之五</p>
<p>石家灣觀桃林</p>
<p>我們承中國銀行鄭相臣君之約定，於十八日一早搭汽車往遊離城三十里的石家灣，那裏有蘭州有名的桃林，近千畝的農田上，中間種植了數十萬株的桃花，從遠處望過去，好似粉紅色的海，眞是好看。</p>
<p>黃河鐵橋</p>
<p>汽車出了門，經過一所關帝廟。南北兩座轅門，前面一座牌坊，廟容極爲壯嚴，現被機關佔用。過了古廟，就是有名的黃河鐵橋，橋建於民國紀元前三年，爲前淸光緒年間陝甘總督升允向美國橋樑公司訂造，此橋早巳超過保用年限，但當局沒有力量重建，所以仍舊讓載重七噸以下的汽車行駛，實在是太危險了。從橋上遠望北岸。白塔山高聳，山頂白塔巍然獨立，自山轉至山頂滿佈寺廟，並有十殿閻王，分築小廟以祀之，足見蘭洲人過去的迷信。</p>
<p>蘭造幣廠</p>
<p>北岸的馬路，本是從蘭州至靑海和新疆的公路，最近政府與蘇聯易貨，尤爲兩國運輸的要道。但是路面尚未修整，黃土鬆浮，深可沒陘。山石沉入灰土中間，行車非常困難，路與黃河並行，離黃河鐵橋不遠，兩個水軍並列，大煨鹵高峙，一聞鄭君說，這就是蘭州造幣廠，也是建於前淸。再往前去，見每隔半里路，就有一個堡，兩個　堡之間，多有泥城相接連。據鄭君說，是左宗棠平囘亂時所築的防城遺址，沿黃河的　田，多爲石田，因用水車灌溉，故土地極爲肥沃。兩岸白楊和綠柳，相映成趣。一片黃土上，增加了蒼翠的顏色，令人忘記了滿目荒涼的景色，足見人定勝天，開發西北不是沒有辦法的。</p>
<p>石灣桃林</p>
<p>車到石家灣，我們下車步行，在桃林繞了一個大圈子。在桃林密度最緊處，看去恰如一片桃色的浮雲，每枝桃樹的花，都開得密密層層，花蕊深紅色，花瓣粉紅色，眞是鮮艷極了。看過去與無錫梅園梅花盛開的時候相似，不過種植的方法，有些像靑島李村的李林，因爲　畝田上，不過種了幾株，不過種的畝數太多了，所以一望無際罷了。路的兩旁間植李樹，也已開放，紅白相間，益發點綴得幽雅，還有棗子樹，尚未着花，樹枝曲折，亦饒襯托之致。桃林的桃樹，多數樹枝不高，挺直少姿，也有數株，幹枝蒼老，又枝伸得蜿蜓多姿，直可與超山的老梅媲美。</p>
<p>農民困苦在桃林中間的路上，看見一輛大車，由一騾一驢拉行，路坡力竭，騾子不肯再向前了。趕車的騾夫，用鞭亂打，亦無效力，急得流眼淚。鄭君與之閒談，知車上碎石，到蘭州城內可換得國幣三元，倘今天到不了城，不特無從得食，即牲口的草，也無處去除嚴。所以急得哭。西北勞動家的苦處，也不是東南的人們所能想像的，大入先生好空談開發西北，大家沒有深入西北的民間，何從得西北老百姓的貧乏呢？前面見到一個　莊一，我們過去和村民談話，知道他們就是桃林的農民，每家都有幾十株桃樹，每株僅值一元左右，可知結了果，也是不大值錢的了。他們的女孩子尚從小纏足，我們勸做母親的不再替她們的女孩子纏足，他們中間也有表示同意的。</p>
<p>甘新公路</p>
<p>在那裏遇到通成公司建築甘新公路的工頭，知道近蘭州的一段公路，已着手　　石子，約有一二個月的時間，就可完工，以後重來石家灣時，當不致再吃崎嶇不平的原始時代道幣的苦頭了。我們常說西北公路是我們和蘇聯交通的國際路線，不料離蘭州二三十里的公路，還是原始時代的騾車路，可知一般高談建設的人們，一向注重開發東南，今日即要加緊建設西北，就有捉襟見肘的現象了。但是亡牟補牢，還未爲晚，倘然我們能够急起直追，併力先從交通下手做云，其他的建設事業，自然迎刃而解了。孫中山先生的建設計劃，本來定蘭州爲中國鐵路網的中心點，我們現在應該做到蘭州爲西北交通的交又點，並爲西南和東北運輸的聯絡站，也是中蘇國際交通的起訖站，第一步整理公路，第二步調整航空路綫，第三步才輪到建設鐵路，同時趕將隴海路修到蘭州，方繼有實行孫先生計劃的可能。</p>
<h3>河內視察</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>【民革社河內通訊】河內，安南的首都，除了和它有特殊利害的人外，在平時，熟知它的人似乎並不很多。但自汪精衛××××，出走河內案發生後，許多人的視綫便轉移到它身上去了。</p>
<p>河內的市街有法國風，除廣東街，和安南土人的幾條街道外，馬路都很寬大，兩傍密密保地種植着樹木，蔭鋵得像撑開一把大傘遮着在街道上活動的人；蟬兒和各種夏虫在枝蔭　合奏若淸脆的交響樂；洋房都不很大，間隔每每都很寬，留下空地作花園，這是天氣太熱的關係，有電軍。電車不是像香港的上下二層的那樣而是豫上海的一樣，兩個車廂，人口總共十五萬，以安南土人最多，法人次之，華僑只有四千左石，還不及西責和海防之多（西貢有數上萬，海防亦在八千以上）。汪案發生後，記者對河內亦頗感興趣，遂有此次內之遊。記者於抵河內後；即分訪我國駐河內總領事及各界華僑人士，詳詢僑胞生活現況，抗×救亡工作動態，汪派之活動及僑胞對汪×之態度等問題。總括歷訪之所得僑胞現在的生活狀況，一般地都還不壞；他們對于捐輪救國，非常熱心。他們有救國組織，有縮食會，每月將縮食之所得，彙交領事館匯寄香港轉呈中央；也有知識份子常常劇劇　，欵救濟難民。不過，一則因爲僑胞太少，以小商人和工人佔最多數，再則因爲僑胞的知識水準較低，一般地說來，這裏的僑胞教爲散漫，也是無可諱言的。實。汪逆不走到傍的地方，偏偏走到這裏來，這絕不是偶然的吧。也許是他佔計這裏的僑胞，頭腦白紙一樣的單純與潔白，容易把握得住，才作出走河內之計。然而，這是他的估計錯了。爲　生活，在殖民地××××的河內乃至全越南的僑胞熱愛祖國的心情，絕不下於其他各屬的僑胞的，他們捐輸救國的熱烈與救亡工作的蓬勃，鐵一樣的證明了這件裏。他們對于汪××××××××，一致的憤慨，一致的反對：他們對于中央政府，最高領袖及持久抗戰的某本國策，無條件的擁護；他們對于抗戰必勝，建國必成的信心像鐵一樣的豎牢。然而，這又並不是說，這裏的華僑中間，一個敗類都沒有，這是誰都不欲　證的。也許因爲上述讚種原因。汪×黨羽，才在這這非常活躍；且其活動範圍非止于此一隅，已蔓延于越南各地及暹誰了。記者偶獲閱五月十六日越南日報在越南　聞欄內有罔咯通訊一則，題爲一出賣祖國的漢奸小間隨處散發　，××××此間煽感僑胞的××活，記之間詳，特一字不改，照錄于次，以饗讀者：</p>

<p>一致贊同　在原則上、美國不應向交戰國家輸送戰爭物料、</p>
<p>致函兩院　外交委會</p>
<p>【中央社華盛頓廿八日電】鐵爾國務卿、昨爲中立法修正事、以同樣之公函、分致參、衆兩議院外交委員會主席後、政界人士頃加以評論云、政府方針至此已顯見重要轉變、嚇爾國務卿定于今晚發表演說、抨擊孤立政策、以爲公函作聲援、大抵此項攻勢、根據兩種理由、（一）在</p>
<p>外交方面、國際局勢表面上似頗安寧、但美國伊應以最賢明之方式、保持和平、即一面賡續嚴密局勢之發展、一面在精神上物質上動員一切力量、以防德、意兩國再有侵略情事、或有出人意外之舉動、美國之取此態度、似乎促使心理上發生良好影響、實則極關重要、此間一般人咸謂、歐洲各國反侵略精神、所由趨於堅定、希特勒元首前於四月初間所籌劃之舉動、所由展緩、或且終得避免者、揆其原因、羅斯福總統四月十五日一電（分致希特勒與莫索里尼）未必無功、（二）在</p>
<p>內政方面　一部份人士對於中立法修正問題、正與政府相抗衡、這種心理、雖不易檢模、卻極有徵象可尋、蓋參、衆兩院對于本案、不無厭倦之狀、時日磋跎、未能依照政府願望從事修正、子是孤立主義派與反對政府派乘機活動、其說乃謂一九四、年舉行大選時、羅斯福總統擬三次參加競選、但因內政上無人支持、欲在外交方面挽回已墮之聲譽、雖使美國牽入戰爭漩汜、亦所不惜云云、中立法修正問題、經此內政上之論辯影響、幾成喧賓奪主之勢、　　　　、以迄今　　　　　　　　　　已成</p>
<p>擊破　　　力量、於是赫爾國務卿先之以發出公函、繼之以發表演說、力闢孤立政策之謬、至以共和黨而論、在國會本屆會期內、旣未能確定一種政綱、以與政府相頡頏、即對于此後政策、亦復舉棋不定、該黨一度曾有與民洽黨溫和派議員相結合之說、亦未見詔事實、因此種反對派雖枰擊政府不遺餘力、而羅斯福總統此際之地位、以視本年初間反較強固、關于此層郵政局長華萊近向民主黨內部并向與論試探意見之後、業已證實、華萊曾謂、羅斯福總統倘願三次參加大選、則民主黨定必推之爲侯選人云、此乃國務院中人均深信羅期福總統之</p>
<p>外交政策　仍爲大部份與論所贊助、特因孤立主義派與反對派沆瀣一氣、廣事宣傳之故、應付不無周章、赫爾國務卿爰以澄淸局勢爲己任、務令中立法修正問題、不復爲內政觀念所混淆、政界一部份人士以爲、政府採取攻勢、雖嫌過遲、仍可促使興論爲之後盾、其他人土則謂、國會反對派深信外交政策、乃係政府弱點所在、或仍將以阻撓爲事、俾中立法修正問題、不及在國會本屆會期中提付討論云、</p>

<h3>用什麼方式爭取香港的讀者大衆？　「文協」座談會紀略</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>許地山先生獻議：訓練說書人材</p>
<p>『香港文藝工作者組織起來！』</p>
<p>『發揮舉桿的偉大作用！』</p>
<p>『加强文化反攻！』</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>客觀環境的要求是那樣迫切，各方面的呼籲又是那麽熱烈；因此，全香港文化人終於在全國文協週年紀念的那一天——三月廿七日——正式組織起來了。名稱叫中華全國文藝界抗×協會留港會員通訊處。簡稱就是「文協」。「文協」成立以來，經常的工作除在「大公」「珠江」「申報」「星島一等報副刊輪流出版周刊之外，還分：「雜誌文學」「西洋文化」「藝術文學」及「電影戲劇文學」四組，每週依次舉行座談會，精神的團結，工作的表現，比從前「各自爲戰」的狀態是進步得多了。</p>
<p>爲了集中研究起見，新近又將四組的座談會統一起來，第一次各組聯合座談會，已於日昨圓滿地舉行過了。</p>
<p>地址是在靑年記者學會。因忙于工作未克參加的固然很多，踴躍出席的還是不少。發表意見的有：許地山，陸丹林，吳景松，方與嚴，潘朗，王劍鳴，彭成慧，郭步陶，麥穗，蔡磊，杜文慧，陳拉特，朱奇卓等。座談的中心題目是：「用什麽方式爭取香港的讀者大衆」。動機不消說是針對着香港很多讀者把有甩的時閒與精力向「有毒讀物」與「低級趣味」方面發展的嚴重間題。</p>
<p>討論的情緒非常熱烈，供献的材料亦十分豐富。詳細情形請見下期「文協」，這裏　因篇福關係，只得介紹其重要結論之一斑：</p>
<p>爭取香港讀者大衆的方式應該：</p>
<p>二，文字力謀通俗化，使人人看得懂；</p>
<p>二，從與讓者有密切關係的問題，或爲讀者愛好的間題中去選取題材，用正確的方法去處理：</p>
<p>三，儘量利用舊形式，發揚新意職，但要勿做舊形式的奴隸；</p>
<p>四，從動員敎師及中學生愛好新文藝作品做起；</p>
<p>五，從娛樂方面及體育方面引起讀者興趣，轉變其錯悮觀念；</p>
<p>六，不要消極迎合低級趣味，要積極加以引導，提高文化水準；</p>
<p>七，報紙之新聞筆法要改良，標點要注意；</p>
<p>八，站在小報的崗位，創作舊形式新內容的作品，爭取小報讀者；與陳腐有毒的作品，作持久的鬥爭；</p>
<p>九，擴大推行拉丁化新文字運動，因爲識字的讀者大衆畢竟還是廣大大衆的一小部份。要加速普及敎育，提高水準，貫輸新意識，另一方面應該從新文字着手；</p>
<p>十，改善連環圖。</p>
<p>十一，……</p>
<p>這中閒，最引起興趣，最具體，最有意義的。是許地山先生所提供的意見。許先生說他時常在西營盤一帶的說書攤中細細觀察過，很多聽說書的，亦喜歡聽什麽義勇軍抗×經過，什麽時事趣聞等材料了。亦有很多說書者，現在不講劍俠那一套，而將『日本間諜』，『西行漫記』等新書，亦亂扯一頓，而且他有本事講得非常動聽，因爲有這般新的趨勢，所以許先生献議將說書者，盲人。賣橄欖者，賣藥品者……組織起來，加以訓練，給他們以新的內客，專僱他們分佈在各中心區宣講，牧效一定是非常宏大。——大家對於許先生的意見表示贊同，紛紛地補充意見，結果，决定交由理事會協同靑年記者學會辦理。我們希望『文協』。及『靑記』兩會負責當局，及早發動起來。負起這個偉大的任務。</p>
<p>最末，决定下次座談會的中心問題爲「在香港特別要寫什麽東西？」時間改在星期五下午六時，地點仍在靑年記者學會，希望文協會友以後準時出席參加。</p>
<h3>日本之無禮行爲</h3>
<p>— 南華早報評論</p>
<p>昨日本港南華早報評論、題爲「日本之無禮行爲」、痛斥×艦搜截外輪之非法、揭發××此種行爲之陰險、並謂××國內經濟形勢更趨惡劣、勝利已陷絕望、時至今日、××已徬徨無措矣、茲將其原文譯錄如后、日人對</p>
<p>攔截外輪之解說、倘其攔截所含之惡意、隱而不　、則誠令人齒冷也、据日本發言人稱、停截鐵行輪船「蘭浦拉」號、純爲例行之事、乃爲查驗其國籍耳、無如「蘭浦拉」號乃一馳名輪船、任可一戰艦艦長對其國籍、絕無何疑惑之可能、且其始終爲一英國輪船、高懸英國國旗、淸晰可見、至法郵船「亞林美士」號、所持之駁辯亦與此相同、關于「蘭浦拉」號之事件、日人之行動、乃爲無理獨斷之舉、此至爲明顯也、惟此種舉動、是否出于日本當局者、或海軍總司令、抑或出于日艦艦長則尙未知悉、一但事實上「蘭浦拉」號、駛距香港領海約一哩之遙他已將駛入香港、而又有何原因遭遇如此熟籌而又含有挑撥性之事件、惟其蓄意尙屬神秘也、至「蘭浦拉」號及「亞林美士」號之事件、適與其他產生騷亂事件之發展吻合、如日本宣佈封鎖整個中國海岸綫、至海外二百里此乃其一也、但日本對比點、</p>
<p>仍事掩飾至日本企圖據得各國在中國之租界、此其二也、而歐洲對日本之局勢、與及其國內經濟情形之惡劣、亦其中之一也、上述最後一項、或可解說一切矣、日本得獲勝利之望巳絕、正在徬徨無措也、凡此種種事實、有互相聯繫之關係在、如今德意兩國須要審愼其行動、或者此時輪至日本以事滋擾、公共租界及租界所生之事、欲使其有機可乘、以達其目的、並且企馴藉之以壓迫列强停止援華也、至鼓浪嶼事件、雖然堅持其條件、而在英美法軍登陸之前、日本卽　退其大部已登陸之部隊、日本對此認爲有損其尊嚴、至無疑義、日本海軍企圖挽囘「臉面』、實不足爲奇也、至日本現在所處之局政、則須最後選擇、</p>
<p>民主國家抑極權國家、惟其在中國之地位、及其與蘇聯之×對行爲、使其選擇不易進行也、際此階段、日本顯破壞英蘇之聯盟、與及促進其對英之地位矣、至攔截外輪之事件、亦乃列强在中日戰爭之始、所特之軟弱態度之自然結果也、日本宣佈實行封鎖、同時宣稱日本之所爲『乃依照一九三七年八九月之宣吿、此爲列强所勉承者也」、由此觀之、亟須否認日本有權封鎖、及列强有承認之事實、且最近日本所發出之宣佈、非爲日本政府所出者、而爲上海日「代理海關副稅務司』、繼卽由上海日海軍發言人所爲者、彼單均無正式官之資格、至一如日本當局所云、無戰爭則無交戰國之權利、卽使</p>
<p>封鎖中國海岸、仍須以合法手續知會各方、而且切實執行、不許任何船舶通過、惟不能將香港亦括入其內也、至列强所承認者、僅許日人據有懷疑船舶之國籍理由、始查檢船艘國籍、此種承認乃爲有限度者也、至列强任其擅爲、乃爲避免與日本磨擦耳、列强對日本之非法行爲、不能再事放棄其權利、除美國之外、列強均無準備武裝護送其本國輪船、而美籍輪舶未遭騷擾者、此誠可注意之事實也、無論如何列强如對日施以報復則首先宜扣留一日輪、以俟「沙忌利士」號輪之釋放中云、</p>

<p>我飛機隊　前綫奏功</p>
<p>又據前方軍訊、東江前綫一帶、旬日來我機極爲活躍、屢出偵襲×陣、查廿四日下午一時許、我神勇空軍一隊若干架、又從某地起飛、空襲增城×軍、在廣增公路沿線上空翱翔窺察、遭有×軍軍仕餘輛、滿儎軍品由廣州東開、駛至中新貝坑附近、我機睹狀、卽以敏捷姿態、從高空疾下、連續投擲重量炸彈多枚、均中標的、當將×軍車廿餘輛炸燬、斃×十餘、×損失軍用品甚多、我機投彈後、再飛增城石龍偵察、于任務完畢後安然返防、</p>

<h3>廣三綫×軍　運輸頻仍蠢蠢欲動　蘆苞戒備森嚴×無法偷渡　×艇不時偵察　被擊沉一艘</h3>
<p>【西江快訊】西江三水前縹×軍、最近頗有增加、廣三綫×運輸頻忘、但多屬糧食之運輸接濟、前綫×軍則無異動、惟×仍有西犯野心、積極作蠢動準備、</p>
<p>三水×軍　大結杉排</p>
<p>邇來三水、前綫之×、迭向各鄉搜集杉木、屯貯於河口倉庫內、凡數千根、廿日佛山×以軍車數輛、滿載繩索餘包竹篾鐵枝等、運到河口西南岡根馬口各地、翌（廿一）日起卽分向附近各鄕、大肆征集民工代其編造杉排木筏、現新壚、滘口、老鴉洲河面、結集×軍木排甚多、有不軌企圖、又據軍息、三水之×、對我扼小北江咽喉之蘆苞重鎭、亟圖吞併、以解除其側面威脅、月來×機時到該鎭偵炸、西江軍事當局、除加强該綫防務實力外、幷飭令蘆西路沿綫之稅警團及某師出擊隊、嚴密守禦、使×無法偷進、</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>好萊塢的黑暗面　乞丐特別多　女演員出賣肉體</h3>
<p>置界影都的好萊塢、在每一個電影觀衆的腦海中、投下了綺麗無比的幻想、使未曾去過影都的人們、以爲總是個黃金遍地的都市、以爲那裏只有光榮、沒有悲哀、只有財富、沒有貧困、於是迷巒神往、響慕不已、其實好萊塢這地方和世界上的其他城市一樣、那裏會像你所想像的那麽美好無缺呢、</p>
<p>在好萊塢、除了少數的明星之外、演員們底生活都是極平淡極淸苦的、每星期有三十元至四十元之薪給的、已經算是上上大吉、這種演員大都和影片公司訂有十星期至十五星期的合同、若無驚人成績、合同滿期後、便很少能在原公司中繼續得到聘書的、臨時演員的酬勞反而高一些、普通每天是八元至十元、這數目雖似不小、但每星期中、能有三天被僱、已是十分幸運了、臨時演員除向中央介紹所登記註冊外、每天還得到各公司去徘徊等待、因爲攝影場中　要臨時演員有時是臨時决定的、所以大家都東鑽西探、惟恐失掉了機會、</p>
<p>普通演員和臨時演員、差不多沒有分別、普通演員、合同滿期後、便爲臨時演員、演時臨員、只要一得到合同、也馬上變爲普通演員、他們底生活情形也大致相仿、自然、他們沒有力量在比佛萊山上造住宅、好萊塢郊外十英里左右的那些公寓、便是這些「未來明星」們底宿舍、他們底經濟力、通常只許他們居住一間一百方尺左右、只有一個小　、每天租金一元至一元半的小房間、每天搭着街車或竟徒步而至好萊塢、一日三餐、參數去光顧各公園及各攝影場附近的小咖啡館、有的就自已帶些廉價的夾肉麵包、坐在公園的長椅上大快朶頤、但若有三五天找不到工作時、就連這一點艱苦的生活、也要發生困難丁、</p>
<p>據今年六月底統計、好萊塢的普通演員和臨時演員共有十二萬四千餘人、每天各公司需要的演員、平均是二萬至二萬五千人、那就是說、每人平均要隔四五天纔能找到一天工作、這些演員中、男性佔百分之四十、女性佔百份之六十、雖然有不少演員、感到生活的不安定、紛紛改業他去、但是後至者依然紛至　來、長時保持着上述數字、</p>
<p>還有一件事、足以使人驚奇的、是好萊塢的乞丐之多、各攝影場門口不絕地有乞丐彿徊、等待着大明星和闊紳的參觀者的佈施、一出手就是一元、不算希罕、所以很有幾個乞丐的收入、竟比演員們來得豐厚、在小餐室裏出入、和未來明星們隔桌同坐、他們所點的菜或者竟比演員們講究、用以表明他們身份的、只是衣衫不得不穿得襤樓一些而巳、</p>
<p>一部份的臨時女演員因爲無法維持生活、不得不操副業、副業的種類甚多、最可慘的當然是肉體的　售、她們底主顧是攝影場工作人員和外來游客、代價和拍戲相仿、祗　你能出到十元以上、便給你享受一個通宵、好萊塢流行着一句俗語：『一個日工、一個夜工、一星期的食宿生活、』眞是慘酷到極點了、</p>

<h3>爲了拍片需要奇怪的東西　好萊塢的最奇怪織業　收集郵票　收集古錢　收集紐扣</h3>
<p>爲了好萊塢的導演、時常因爲拍攝影片、需要奇怪的東西、結果就造成了許多專家、在好萊塢有着奇怪的職業、</p>
<p>牧集郵票的人　有時把珍奇的郵票、供給影片公司、在銀幕上顯示一回、也有一個收集錢幣的人、專靠收集古錢供給攝片者需要、而維持生活、</p>
<p>下五萬枚鈕扣</p>
<p>最奇怪的、是收集鈕扣的一個專家、爲了鈕扣、他一年要賺不少錢、也原是影片公司的裁縫出身、　被發現了有時拍攝影片需要古怪的鈕扣、便開始去幹這收集的勾當、現在他所藏的扭扣、有十五萬枚以上、包括當初拿破崙衛兵所用的古鈕扣在內、</p>
<p>各種瓶子都有</p>
<p>瓶的收集、也可獲得厚利、不過所佔的地方較大、不久之前、有一張影片、需要斯于的那維亞半島的古瓶、另一張、需要奇珍的中國式醬油瓶、收集瓶的人、他們所收藏的、有香水瓶、實驗室小瓶、藥水瓶、和各種外國的瓶、</p>
<p>研究鬍鬚値錢</p>
<p>在影片之中、鬍鬚的收藏家、是不需要的、但好萊塢有一位研究鬍鬚的專家、他對於俄羅斯一個公爵夫人的鬍鬚、什麽都可吿訴你、條頓民埃的鬚、義大利人的鬚、斯拉夫人的鬚、如果有懷疑付了相當大的費鬚他都可吿訴你、</p>
<p>另外的奇怪職業、有一個收集肩章的專家、有一個婦人能够背誦任何菜餚、自古代中古到現在、最奇特的一種職業、一個人用手工織成蛛網、攝製地獄的鏡頭、他的蛛網就有銷路。索取代價限高、</p>

<h3>戲劇學校　米高梅公司出品　主演　露意絲納　阿侖馬賽爾　寶蓮高黛</h3>
<p>「好吧，你這一次來參加全級同學的晚餐嗎？」　都有一晚在收集每月宴會的經費時，這樣譏刺的問她。「或者歡依舊又要出錢不列席了吧？今晚是什麼推托呢？」</p>
<p>娜便挿嘴說道：「你不知道嗎，」曼都？她正要上暹邏的宮庭去呢，並且她的姑母要和印度王子結婚，好必須赴二個盛大喜筵，而且——」</p>
<p>可愛的娜娜老是這樣的——慣於挖苦人，他憎惡別人，她要創傷別人——整個世界，因爲她自己受到創傷。她要恣意得到可能得到的東西，因爲她所需求的一樣的東西——年靑的弗勞萊的愛情——已屬於別個婦人了。</p>
<p>現在她面對着露意絲，像貓兒看見耗子似的要等機會撲過去吞食它。在學校的大廳內，她們周圍擠着許多同學，一喜悅閒適的談着笑着。他們準備拿別人消費來自己作樂。有趣的事！</p>
<p>但是露意絲却說道：「如果你們要我出聚餐費，就拿去吧。」有誰管她的經濟非常困難呢！「不過你却猜中的的——我不能來，並不是我不願意來——」</p>
<p>娜娜發笑道：「我猜想你和什麽美少年亦幽會呢。你每晚幹些什麽啊？」</p>

<h3>舢舨駕駛法</h3>
<p>— 潘叢紹</p>
<p>一、不曉得橈在水中運動所經路線對于自身左右擺動的影響——假如不把這個最基本的駕舟原理弄个明白、斷不能獨駕舢舨的、二个初學者駕一葉的轉舟、左推右撥、自身却總在打圈轉、嘗過這種滋味的學習者、知道了橈與水抗所生推舟　進的力量對于舟行方向會因橈在水中運用的位置之不用而有左右小大的轉變、不禁覺得前此苦練盲習時白費氣力、也有其便捷的門徑了</p>
<p>二、不明白要想推舟前進、同時又能主持舟行方向的相互關係——推舟的動作最易做出、只消雙手執橈、一高一低、握着橈的柄部、坐在舟邊、把它從身前插進水中、向後拖去、然後在身後舟邊水中抽出、循環運動、便能使舟前進、殊不知在上述簡單的動作中、橈在水中運動所經過路線如何、這就是舟行方向之所繫、非加以研究不可的。</p>
<p>根據上述兩種原因、能够加意練習、事半功倍、</p>
<p>第一、司舵的主力發生于舟末、練習單駕舢舨者所乘的位置在舟尾、假如橈在水中轉動的位置盡在舟末之贛的、其能轉動舟行方向的力量愈大、初學者坐在這麽的一個位置駕舟、雖然開始就要感到舟行方向變動太强的困難，也就因爲由于舟行方同變動太强而更能察覺挖在水中運動路線所及于舟行方向是如何的，故在初學時坐在舟末的位置要在最末之處，其實爲求便于駕舟計，亦　保持上述駕舟位置的道理。</p>
<p>第二、身體坐在舟末左右任何一邊、這在學習與　用、全無關係、拿坐舟的駕舟方法來說吧、要想舟頭掉左的動作是怎樣的、舟　之所以能够轉其前進的方向、顯然在舟的一旁發生一種向其推移的力量、設想這種力量是由單橈在舟末下的水中發作的、一定要使舟後的水受着橈自前而後從右往左撥動的反抗力量、舟頭便要轉往左方去、這是力之應用、舉一可以聯想及于其餘、盡管動作會有不同、只要應用力的道理相同、其所能使舟方向的改變、不會異樣、</p>
<p>第三、身觀的坐位仍在右邊的，要想卅首轉右，原有兩種的方法。其一：把橈附在舟身，也即在舟右的末端，一手將之緊附，另一手將其還在水中的橈板向外頻頻撥動，方向自向右轉。不　，一方面想求舟行速度的維持，一方面又要前進方向的改變，那就是不合要求的動作，卽要求其次：這一個動作。比較　學，但須學會的，否則獨駕舢舨的技術，無由再進，把橈仍是自前而後，但不要再把橈板與舟同其正對的方向、換句話說、自前住後撥動的撓板要向舟邊靠過來斜向水中、從左往右、即自前而後同時也自左往右在水中撥過去的、舟首即往右轉、</p>
<p>第四、駕舟前進、從推舟前進的動作中、兼施舟行方向轉換的動作、根據第三和第四兩項的說明、除了須要向左或朝往轉、就要將鄱兩項的動作做出來外、舟行方向總要維持正向前方繼續前進的、這樣前進路線旣可免曲線的運動、徒然增加以前進的距離、又能避免由于舟身左右擺動而致前進力量的減少、怎樣持久不使前進方向改變、非在每次把橈撥水時留意方向與橈的動作保持正常的關係不可、一</p>
<p>依照上述四項的方法、動作舢舨駕駛的練習、所謂熟極生巧、在應用上不愁其劣拙的、（二）</p>

<h3>最近上海日圓跌價原因的分析</h3>
<p>— 史亦聞</p>
<p>自「華興銀行」於本月十六日開幕後、一般不明內情的人、都惶惶不安、以爲法幣的價値、將遭受重大的壓迫、上海的金融市場、亦將不免受其影響、但迄至目前、事實昭示吾人、法幣的價値、固未絲毫變動、上海的金融市場、亦未有任何不穩現象、證明了因『華興銀行』成立而憂慮的、正是庸人自擾、</p>
<p>其實、就目前上海金融市場的實際情形來看、因『華興銀行』的成立而受其影響的不是中國的法幣、倒是日圓自己、在『華興銀行』開幕前數日、（五月十三日）日圓與法幣黑市塲的比價、爲日圓一〇〇元、換法幣一〇二元强、但自十六日（華興銀行開幕日）起、日圓己跌與法幣等價、至今日、（五月二十日）竟跌至祗能換法幣九十五元了、（見昨日本報）在這一週以內、日圓對法幣、已跌價八元以上、而此種跌勢、今後尙有繼續發展的可能、</p>
<p>日圓的跌價、本不是今日始、憶在去年六七月間、日圓在公開市場的行市、要比法幣貴三〇％左右、（卽日圓一〇〇元、可換法幣一三〇元左右）至九月間卽降至二〇％、（卽日圓一〇〇元、可換法幣一二〇元）至今年一二月間又降至一〇％（卽日圓一〇〇元、可換法幣一一〇元）至最近、竟跌至與法幣的平價以下、如果用英匯來換算、在去年的九月間、日圓的匯値、已自其基準匯値（一先令二辦士）跌至十辦士、至今年一二月間巳跌至九辦士、至最近已跌至七辦士左右。日元這種不斷的跌勢、當然不是偶然的現象、而是有其客觀的原因。値得吾人研究的。</p>
<p>在去年九月間、日圓跌價正劇時、筆者曾爲文匯報撰文、（見九月二十日該報經濟特載）指出其跌價的原因、茲摘錄其中的一節、以爲參考、</p>
<p>『自一九三七年戰事爆發以後、日本紙幣流入中國者、不下二萬萬元、其中流入華北者約」萬萬五千萬元、（大部朝鮮銀行紙幣）流入江南戰區者、五千萬元、（大部爲日本銀行紙幣）此等紙幣之來源、一部爲日軍在戰區內措辦軍需之資金、大部則爲在華作戰日軍士兵的俸給、在二三月（去年）間、日圓流入上海的已有五千萬元之巨、至五六月問、復有一部投機商人、利用上海法幣、奪買華北日圓、因此華北日圓、滾滾南下、上海竟成日圓泛濫之所、上海的日圓、爲數旣增、要是可以自由購買外匯。則其價値自不成問題、但在日政府嚴格管理之下、欲購買百元以上的外匯、郎須呈請核准、條件非常苛刻、不特此也、上海的日商銀行、對於以日圓償付由日本輸出的貨價的交易（如押匯）也拒予接受、（其目的在限制無外匯的貨物的出口）上海日圓所處的環境旣如此、而上海市場對牠的實際需要又不大、因此成了半身不遂的通貨、而其價値的跌落、也自然是不可避免的了。』</p>
<p>上面是日圓在去年九月間跌價的一般原因、但是目前日圓的跌價、其情形怎樣呢、首先將日人方面自己的說法、加以介紹、</p>
<p>日人認爲目前上海日圓的跌價、其最大原因、有下述三點、第一、是因東北及華北方面限制大豆及豆油輸入華中的結果、過去、自東北及華北輸入上海方面大豆及豆油價値、每月約計二三百萬元、目前上海方面旣無此種物品的輸入、則上海每月就要多出二三百寓元的日圓頭寸、上海日圓頭寸的過剩、自使日圓的價値低落、</p>
<p>第二是因日本來華的人數激增、日圓也就大量隨帶而來、據四月份的統計、自日來滬的日人、共八千三百五十人、如每人平均携帶五百日元、則在一月中、流入上海的日圓、便有四百萬元一年中便成五千萬圓、在沒有日圓地位的上海金融市場中、要容納這樣巨額的頭寸、自然是很困難的、由此影響於匯値、也是免不了的事</p>
<p>第三、是因日本限制對華方面貨物的輸出、减少日圓的需要。因着佔領區日貨供給的减少、則佔領區的人民、自然要以日本所發行的軍用票、運至上海、掉渙日圓、復由日圓換成法幣、以法幣向外商或華商採辦所需的物資、因此、估領區人民對於法幣大量的需要的結果、自然會使日圓受壓迫太跌價、（參看五月十九日上海每日新聞）</p>
<p>以上三種情形、我們也承認確是目前日圓跌個的原因、但只是表面的原因、派生的原因、根本上是在日本國力問題、換言之、是在日圓的購買力問題、我們知道、日本自從發動對華戰爭後、其所消耗的軍費、巳總百萬萬元之鉅、軍事費的消耗、事實上就是物力的消耗、也就是國力的消耗、要是日本的生產力足以適應巨大的軍事消耗、則日政府欲通過財政的機構、來動員戰爭所需的物資、固不成問題、然而大家知道、日本的生產力是非常脆弱的、非特未能因戰事的大量消耗、補充其戰事所需的物資、而且反因戰事物力人力大量的消耗、益見其生產力的捉襟見肘、入於衰竭之途、現在日政府只靠竭澤而漁的辦法、增發紙幣、創造新購買力、去徵發民間的積蓄力、維持其對外戰爭、試看日圓紙幣的發行數額、已自一九三七年六是月的十五萬萬元增至目前的二十五萬萬元左右了、（去年底一度增至二十九萬萬元）在戰後二十個月中、新購買力（紙幣）的數額、竟較前增加幾近一倍、而其國內的物資（包積蓄力及生彥力）並未跟着偽造的購買力數量而遞增、（事實上是在减少中）因此購買力興物資間失却了相對的均衡、在其國內所表示的就是物價的飛漲、在國外所表爲的就是日圓匯値的跌落、</p>
<p>目前日圓在上海的跌價、也就是其購買力減低的證據、但日圓在上海的跌價、僅不是對法幣的跌價、（因爲法幣價値並未變動）而是對一切外幣的跌價、不過、上海日圓的跌價、除了上述的購買力减低的原因外、尙有下述二種原因、也不可忽視的、</p>
<p>第一、是因近來華北僞聯銀券的跌價、使日圓也跟着跌價、僞聯銀券的跌價、由於華北僞府及日軍在財政上的需要、因而濫事發行者一半、由於人民對偽聯銀券價値的慮懼、而以僞聯銀券掉換貨物（或法幣）者亦一半、因僞聯銀劵與日圓的等價關係、使日圓的價値也爲之拉低、於是復有一部投機者（包括日本人）以法幣套買華北日圓、復以日圓運至上海套買法幣、益使上海的日圓加甚對法幣的需要、而壓迫其價値的跌落、</p>
<p>第二、是因『華興銀行』紙幣的發行計劃、必無形减少日圓的實際需要、同時又因「華興銀行」的紙幣並　　　　　　　　　因濫發　　　　（一如華北僞　　券的情形）日本早知其此種後果、故宣佈「華興券」不奧日圓聯繫、無異反映日圓基礎的空虛、因之一般人民（包括日本人）多不敢收藏日圓、而寧掉換價値權定之法幣、（或購買貨物）因使法幣價値相對的增高、而使日圓價值步步下跌、</p>
<p>上述的二種原因、所以會有力的促使上海日圓的跌價、正因日購買力根本減低之故、也可說是通貨膨賬的結果、刖由此所表示的不僅是日圓對外的信用的動搖一、而且是號明日本在對華騙擊中、所受的損失之重大、要是對戰爭、仍無法結束、則今後日本國力的消耗、一定與日俱增、而日圓的購買力、也必日趙惡化、日圓購買力惡化的結果、不僅將使其維持戰爭發生種種困難、而且將促使其全體　民經濟的總崩潰、目前日圓不斷的跌價、巳可看出日本已在走向總崩潰的路、反之、目前法幣價値的穩定、與將日圓價値的相對的騰貴、正證明中國採取長期消耗戰戰略的正確、表示中國在軍事上已走向優勢的過程、最後勝利是不成問題的、</p>

<h3>華興銀行與上海市場</h3>
<p>— 辛亥</p>
<p>所謂「華興商業銀行」對於上海市場、影響是渺乎其小的、市面雜有流言蜚語、只要庸人不自擾、「華興」是奈何不得的、</p>
<p>但當「華興」成立的消息傳出後、法幣的外匯暗盤、遠期曾經一度緊縮、此蓋當初市場人心未能沉着、對於它認識不足所致、及認識了、它的性質、伎倆、故卽安定如恒、但當它在十六日開業之日、又不知從那裏散放出種種毫無根據的謠言、致使敏感的市場、又受了一度可笑的簸弄、公債暗盤、因之忽降、筆者所聽到的謠言、大概有四說、</p>
<p>一、說是國府爲抵禦「華興」的奪取法幣計、擬以劃頭代替五元以上的法幣流通、僅留一元以下的小額通貨在市場流通、以後只有劃頭可以購買外匯云、</p>
<p>二、說是國府對於公債的還本付息、此後將全部改在重慶付款、不再用在「重慶一次付給、對滬分六期付款」的辦法、以减少法幣頭寸流入上海云、</p>
<p>三、說是將逐漸收回中央、中國、交通的法幣、任令其餘八家合法的商業銀行所發紙幣及雜鈔流通、而此項非中、中、交鈔票、無購買外匯之資格云、</p>
<p>四、說是現有的法幣外匯平衡基金、將分攤給中、英、美三國、僅對中、英、美、三方面供給、對普通需要、則暫不以予供給云、</p>
<p>這種謠言竟使市場上一部份人爲之衝動、實在未免太缺乏判斷力了、先從第一點來說、賢明的當局、决不會出此减損法幣威信的下策、因為、如果只許劇頭購買外匯、那末法幣調劃頭必至貼水、法幣貼水、便與法幣跌價無異、而且法幣在付出貼水、調得劃頭後、仍能購買外匯、怎能因多出調劃頭一道手續、而防止僞「華興」藉吸牧法幣奪取外匯的企圖、大槪這一個謠言、是起因於洋商銀行的劃頭對法幣申水的、洋商銀行爲避免　幣計算的煩雜、喜收劃頭是實、但並不能因之而認爲劃頭的代法幣流通、彰　明甚、</p>
<p>第二點同樣可笑、卽使國府想收縮戰區內的法幣、也不必彈此老調、况政府維持債信、素具决心、自不會撤消前次的諾言、而且政府儘可從別方面制限法幣流到上海來、爲何一定要在這公債本息的付款上打算盤呢、</p>
<p>第三點、也是不可能的、如巢歡府收圓中中交三行鈔票、任令雜鈔　通、豈不是等於政府自己打自己的嘴巴、中中交鈔票是法幣、其他商業銀行所發的也是法幣、前者可以購買外匯、而後者不能購買外匯、這不是自己破壞業巳統一的幣　麽、卽在天津租界內也永不會有收囘法幣的事、且恰恰相反、當華北資金紛紛南逃時、天津的中國交通兩行、反限制申匯、維持法幣在華北原有的流通數量、因爲倘便收囘法幣、租界內便無可資流的通貨、那末、僞幣便可乘機而來、奪得法幣的流通區域、政府當局豈會如此發傻矚、</p>
<p>最後一點、誰都知道、法幣平衡基金的設立、是爲了安定法幣的對外價値、所以凡是持有法幣的人、倘有必要、不論其爲華商英商等等、均能購得外匯、法幣的持有人固有國籍的分別、但法幣决不是因持有人國籍的不同而異其價値的、所以攤派法幣平衡基金云云、不值識者一笑、要防禦流入僞「華興」的途徑多書呢、如不使內　物產落入日僞之手、不買日貨等均是、</p>
<p>其實、就是不經過上面的剖析　單憑今日市場的轉穩、統一各債的囘好、也可以證明這種種謠言的不足信了、</p>

<h3>由五卅想起</h3>
<p>— 季子</p>
<p>眼看五月卅日雙要來了，不由人想起上海，想起日本人的氣焰。八一三事變的前一年，我初到上海，住在北國川路的一個旅館裏，打算參加入學考試。每天傍晚在翻書之餘，總喜歡邀幾個朋友廷馬路。在東洋化的街道中穿揷着，偶然也看見一小隊日本兵　處巡　。步履自然。宛右在自己領土內行走一樣，看了教人生氣，在經過虹口日本海軍陸戰隊司令部的時侯，路人大都匆匆忙忙走過。似乎不敢往面多看一眼，省得日本站　無理取鬧。平空吃虧，對於靶子場附近的日本乓營也有着同樣情形，人們都不敢加以正視，　见了活閻羅似的，外處初來的人總覺不勝　異，我便是其中一個，當時不但日本軍人威風凜凛，便是一些　手杯閒的浪人，其横蠻也兇得很可以了，窮極無聊時便愛扮作醉鬼，到處毆打中国人，意欲藉端生事，不幸吃了耳光的人，祗是敢怒不敢言，含羞忍辱避开便算了，誰也不願因此引起是非，同樣的事　，我看過了幾囘，每囘都氣得說不出話來，以後我進了大夏念書，學校附近有家豐田紗廠，這是規模宏偉的日本紗廠，廠內常駐軍隊　護，這些軍隊不特保護紗廠，还不分畫夜遣隊監經過附近鐵道的京　列車，看有有沒有調運軍隊紗廠更築有高臺以資瞭望，神氣活現，儼然上海主人翁，冬天裏上海爆發了日本紗廠罷的風潮，由楊樹浦各廠曼延到梵　渡的　田紗廠來時，日本也調來許多海軍陸戰隊，唐克車鎭壓中国男女工，中山桥接近紗廠一端佈滿了陸戰隊，巡捕，另一端佈滿了許多中国警察，中間是罷工工人，形勢萬分緊張，祗要一星星火，便可惹起大衝突想不到日本軍隊竟在此時拋掷催淚彈驅散工人，一時秩序大亂，中山路一帶突然騷觔起來，我們手無寸铁的工人。終於很狽退走了。我在上海住不上一年，所見盡是一些日本人横衝直撞的暴行，而中国人格於環境關係，除了含淚忍受以外，一時又沒有其他更好方法對付，那時日本人的氣焰，高漲到了極點。</p>
<p>究竟忍受是有個限度的，七七事變發生不久，八一三抗战便隨之而起，我在外灘上看見中国飛機第一次日以继夜的轰炸出雲艦，而中國人一向俯首而過不敢芷視的日本兵營，也被炸得　无完膚，蘇州河南岸　田紗廠，往日裏曾有千百個中国工人被敲打虐待的魔窟，居然也印上了我們的開花　彈痕，這時，按檢横立怒目而視的「皇軍」，驕縱横蠻的浪人全不見了，我們極目窮眺所見的祗是四行倉庫的國旗和八百壯士雄姿，聽聞的祗是浦東我方砲擊的巨響，上海之驕子的日本人那裏去了？</p>
<p>五月卅日來臨的時候，上海租界內的警探人員又少不免忙碌一番，郤是今年的五卅，可就不是十四年前的五州了，那時我們的生命操在操人手裏。別人的剌刀壓住我們的胸膛，而今呢？由五卅引起的反抗精神，已彌　了一千多萬方公里。輸入四萬萬五千萬顆心裏，當年紗廠裏殺死了一個工人，今日已由七十萬萬的傷亡員兵，七十萬萬元的消耗去償還血債了。彥岐</p>
<h3>新詩的新</h3>
<p>— 彥岐</p>
<p>所謂『新詩』，在某一種觀點上看來，固然是有『新』的形式，『新』的格調，『新』的情緒，『新』的意義的詩；但是遺留在普通一般人心目中的所謂「新詩』，不過是『分行寫的白話文」而已。其實『新詩』的『新』，决不單就是分行離，或者用白話句宇而言；因爲『新詩』不但『新』，而且也是『詩』。</p>
<p>記得柯可先生寫旣一篇論詩的文章，裏面有一句話，現在還値得提出來，當新話來說。</p>
<p>他說：『一切見景，生情，感時，傷事，咏物，寄託，唱和，贈答等詩，卽使做出，也不能算新詩了』。</p>
<p>他的意思是，在舊圈子裏兜不出「新」的來而一新一的東西也决不會躱在舊圈子裏面，「新詩」是從「舊詩」的舊　子裏跳出來的；旣跳了出來，當然不必再回過頭，伸一隻　囘去，以致只有新的格式，而沒有　的性質。譬如說古人寫詩愛記山林幽境的生活，這全爲了他們的生　中是可以有山林幽境的生活。他們在泉旁茅亭裏坐着，濡筆吟咏，寫出來的當然是那樣幽閒的東西。這東西　在舊櫃子裏，自然就是「舊詩」但是如果現在的詩人，也寫起隱居的幽居詩來，一看便知道上了古人的當，落了古人的陳套了，現在我們還上那裏找隱居的山林幽境去？卽使找到了，能夠恬然幽居嗎？又能够悠然寫詩嗎？不幸的。今日的世界不允許有這種事了。</p>
<p>不過太現實的貨色，都是詩人目中的俗物，洋房，汽車，飛機，這些東西都被人認爲是「科學的」，不配入詩—於是，「新詩人們徬徨起來了，學古人旣不合式，搬出自己這些東西又嫌俗不可耐，於是只好在女人的　　上轉來轉去了。而所謂「新詩」呢？格式「新」了，題材「新」了，而「新」過之後，又落入另一個「舊」境地裏去了。</p>
<p>「新」與「舊」，是「前」與「後」的代表。當我看到分行寫的「唉—我的家　呢！」這流句子時，我眼前只有一片『舊』一堆「落後」。如果　也算一新詩—、那我眞要懷疑起來了。</p>
<p>反之，如果寫上一首進行曲，萬一「詩」意少了，可是「新的氣味倒也許可以多留些；那末還至少，給我一點一新」的感覺。</p>
<p>好像有人以為詩寫在外國格式上，便不新也新了。這眞使我　　！『新詩』好容易　出了「舊詩」的格調的樊籠，如果自冉鑽進外　樊籠，其不能澈底變「新」是意中事了。我個人覺得，『新詩一要套上外國枷鎖，其實還不如利用詞的格調。因為旣然怕沒有了枷鎖　出毛病，那末何不安分一點，不必跳出固有的形式的軌道，只要在性質，　　方面去找「新」好了。而同時，在舊的形式，舊的格　上，不但不必拋之不顧，甚至更應該多多注意。要能在一舊」中找出「舊」，然後才能創造新的靈魂。而一味見景，生情，感時，詠物，寄託，唱和，永遠玩來玩去　一套，雖人是「　」人，而詩　是「古」詩。現在，引　略特「　新與個人的才能」裏的幾句話來說淸楚吧：「詩人，任何藝術的藝術家，　也不能單獨的具有他完全的意義，他的重要以及我們對他的　賞就是找們對他與已往詩人及藝術家的關係的賞鑑，你得　他放在前人之間來　照比較，我認爲這一個批評的原理，美學的，不僅是歷史的，他之必須適應，必須一致，並不是一方面的；一種藝術作品之產生同時就是以前所有一切的藝術作品之變態的復生，這個已成的規模在新作品未來時本是完全的，爲的要在加添新奇的東西以後樓　保持完全的狀態，整個的規　多少總得改變一下；因此事件藝藝作品對於全體的關係，比例和價値又經過一番配合了。這就是「新」與「舊」的適應」。</p>
<h3>南京撤退的前夜</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>「你們這有新的使命。你們今天非渡江不可，軍長有點停泊在上新河，你們快去找尋。』某部主任鎭靜而嚴　地說。在他　副包公式的　上，很難測度出前綫的命運來。</p>
<p>「那末我們就走吧！」四正從主任芭蕉似的手掌中就接下一筆足够維持我們鍾一　半年的生活費。</p>
<p>毯子，乾糧袋，熱水瓶。全部武裝起來，像隻這征的駱駝。同志們的面上沒有喜悅，沒有悲傷，神情還是那麽恬靜，別了主任同另一部的工作人員，從這大怪物口中葉了出來。無力的太陽正掛在頭頂上，是中午了，但我們還沒有想到吃飯。</p>
<p>出挹江鬥，踏上滿是　　的塘沿；五六步之間就有一個深深的小坑。上面發現　爪，我們沒有躲避。</p>
<p>抵上新河已是傍晚的時候。它是一個臨江的小鎭，在這裏已不見有爿開著門的店舖，而老百姓却還疏落地發現在街上。</p>
<p>「今天離開了這裏不知什麽時候再得囘來？」在我們立着的對面，一爿豆腐店裏的老太婆，很費力地搬着變隻人缸；但她臉上却沒有悲傷的樣子。</p>
<p>「總有一天這地方還是我們的。等着吧！」一個靑年，大槪是她的兒子，很活躍地幫着搬取東西，精神極興奮。</p>
<p>他們望望我們。帶着誠樸的笑容；但沒有交談，他們太忙了。</p>
<p>經過兩小時的工夫，搜遍了附近的小港，沒有找到一隻船的影子。太陽全部給大地呑沒了，四周靜得可怕；點綴着的祇有迫近的密集的機槍聲，和斷續的小砲聲</p>
<p>「報吿官長！」　地奔來了一位滿身泥灰的兄弟，他額上的汗珠，滴滴滾下，胸前濕了一大堆，提着　，兀自氣喘喘地。</p>
<p>「什慶事？」</p>
<p>「請問我們的機槍連在什麽地方。某營長命令我來通知他們準備作戰，對方離開這　　有二里光景了……」他迅速地說着。</p>
<p>「這却不知道，我們是某部的，請你到前山問問，」我們表示十二分的歉意，不能給他一個答覆。</p>
<p>然而這突如其來的消息，可多麽剌激呢。我們等待嗎？還是囘城？兩個問題在每個同志的腦子中盤旋着。終於我們决定：假使中途接觸了，我們是要積極地發揮威力的。</p>
<p>遠處忽跑來了一位黑軍服的軍官：</p>
<p>「你們是××師嗎？師長是不是×××？」他瞧着我們的番號說，他挺年輕，是當地的警察局長：爲了職務關係，還在這黑暗裏搜索巡邏。</p>
<p>「是的！」我們同聲地回答。話雖然是那麽簡單，但誰都充滿了熱情，心　　懷着這樣一个共同的念　：</p>
<p>「如果接觸了，那我們就有這位富有軍事知識的軍官同我們相互聯絡了。」</p>
<p>我們圍着他拉雜的談起來，他很熟悉我們一師的情形。</p>
<p>「——你們還是囘城的好』話講得很慢。也許他恐怕我們遺沒有知道這裏的　境。</p>
<p>「囘城恐怕也是不能够的了！」帶眼鏡的同志我們叫他小開的說。</p>
<p>「這也不一定，從這裏到水西門有一條捷徑，祇須六七里路就可抵達！」他　着自己的手　，「呵——七點半，從時間上計算，在你們抵達械門之前，也許城　還沒有炸斷。」</p>
<p>他小心地吿訴我們普通和特別的口令：更　了一張簡明的地圖。</p>
<p>爲着我們的使命，我們就雕開了他。</p>

<h3>最後底勝利</h3>
<p>— 陳幸謀</p>
<p>趙家兄弟剛從李公館打完彈子歸來，疲倦地躺在軟綿綿的沙發上。</p>
<p>『老二，』大趙輕彈着那支三個五的灰　，嘲笑似地向他的兄弟說：『爲什麼你們的學校，這般的討厭，天天都要上課的？明天蜜斯朱和蜜斯何找我們去兜圈子，你是否還要到學校去？」</p>
<p>「不，還是和你們兜圈子去，」好幾天沒有返C大學的老二，本打算明天回去上上本系李敎授的憲法；但是，爲了避免做一個「弱者」，他就馬上打消原意了。</p>
<p>『聽說王愛妹已到了這里，我們今晚和老李去中華玩玩吧。』</p>
<p>『不過，……』</p>
<p>「不過什麽？老二，」大趙不耐煩地說。</p>
<p>『你那里還有幾多？我只剩着廿塊了」平素很樂觀的老二，這時也有點眉　。</p>
<p>「哈！哈！我以爲你爲着什麽着急！」他立卽按按喚人鈴，他底手　放下，卽有一個俟人進來。</p>
<p>『亞和，給我蓋個圖章，到公司徐司理處支二百洋，還有，今晚給教預備那套白色的新「沙土堅」。』</p>

<h3>Historical Lessons</h3>
<p>"Past events, if not forgotten, are a guide for the future." The greatest significance of human history lies in using the experiences and lessons of our ancestors or predecessors to guide our struggle forward, to achieve the most ideal path to happiness in life. What the Chinese people and the Chinese nation are pursuing today is mainly to drive out the Japanese aggressors who are coercing us towards extinction, and to strive for the liberation of all the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from the oppression, robbery, rape, [censored], massacre, [censored] of the Japanese, and to achieve independence, freedom, equality, and happiness.</p>
<p>In our history, there have been many such struggles for liberation, leaving behind very precious precedents for victory and very precious experiences and lessons. Especially after Dr. Sun Yat-sen met the upsurge of the May Fourth Movement and realized the radical reorganization of the Kuomintang, and after Dr. Sun accepted all the experiences and lessons of all liberation movements in human history and created the Three People's Principles and determined the Outline of National Reconstruction in response to the international and domestic situation and needs, the Chinese national liberation movement today in 1925 made a new impression on the world, looking at the revival of the East and the rebirth of China with admiring eyes, and we ourselves, even when we recall it today, cannot help but feel our hearts leap and our blood boil, increasing our infinite courage and confidence in the liberation movement currently underway.</p>
<p>The national liberation movement of today in 1925, the movement that laid the victorious foundation for China's revolution and nation-building, its most important and great significance was the first concrete manifestation of the Chinese national united front in the mass movement; and on the eve of the Northern Expedition, when the upsurge of seeking liberation was boiling throughout the country, the national liberation movement in every city was enthusiastically participated in not only by students, workers, and farmers, but also by national capitalists, and the formal establishment and development of the Federation of Industry, Commerce, and Education became the organizational form of the first mass united front in China. Due to the great power of this national united front, it not only demonstrated the great power of Chinese young students, especially workers and farmers, in the national liberation movement, but also demonstrated that national capitalists were also an important force in resisting [censored] and saving the country. At the same time, because of the persistence and correct leadership of the revolutionary party at that time for this movement, the movement was able to achieve extensive and in-depth development. This is the first historical lesson we need to deeply reflect on today.</p>
<p>The current War of Resistance and nation-building endeavor of the Chinese national liberation movement to strive for independence, freedom, equality, and happiness is entering a new and critical stage. We should now more solemnly recognize the experience of victory and the lessons of failure that millions of people's blood and heads exchanged for fourteen years ago: we must learn from the experience of victory, the first is to further consolidate the unity of all nationalities, all classes, and all parties in China, and expand the united front of the entire Chinese nation in the War of Resistance and nation-building. However, our common [censored] Japanese aggressors are following their "path to victory" fourteen years ago, and are changing to political offensives as the main focus, combined with military offensives, and are devoting their efforts to maintaining their collusion with all feudal remnants, corrupt forces, and stubborn elements in China, and are devoting their efforts to luring Chinese traitors, rebels, wavering and conservative elements, and using smoke screens and poison gas such as "anti-communism," "peace," "Japan-Manchuria-China cooperation," and "East Asia New Order" to divide our national united front for the War of Resistance and nation-building, to strengthen their rule, robbery, and exploitation in the occupied areas of China, and to use these new strategies to solve the internal and external difficulties and crises caused by their war of aggression against China, and to prepare for new steps to conquer all of China and dominate East Asia! Therefore, we must also accept the lessons of failure fourteen years ago, and wage a persistent struggle against all the conspiracies and poisons of the Japanese [censored] to sow discord, divide, and disintegrate the unity of our entire nation, all parties, and groups; and wage a persistent struggle against all the speeches and actions of Chinese [censored] traitors, rebels, wavering and conservative elements that violate the central government's policies for the War of Resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>On the eve of the invaders encountering an irreparable blow, on the eve of the traitors and rebels encountering an unavoidable sanction, they will use all unimaginable cruel and vicious conspiracies! Perhaps this is the moment! Let us use greater determination and persistence to deal them a fatal blow! Final victory will come to us after the completion of this blow!</p>
<h3>War of Resistance and Nation-Building and the Cultivation of National Morality</h3>
<p>— Liu Haiou</p>
<p>1. The Causes of the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Taking the First World War from 1914 to 1918 as a wedge, the histories of China and Japan developed in opposite directions. Japan took advantage of the opportunity of the European War to accelerate itself to the "final stage," and from then on, its internal contradictions increased day by day, and its fate was only groping in the dark, with no bright future.</p>
<p>China, on the contrary, took advantage of the opportunity of the European War to lay a weak foundation for national industry. Driven by revolutionary beliefs, the Chinese people closely followed the development of national capital, and successively launched the anti-feudal May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926. At that time, China had obtained the opportunity to become self-reliant, and the original driving force for the upward development of Chinese history was generated.</p>
<p>After the European War, the internal crisis of Japanese imperialism gradually increased. In order to solve this crisis, it suddenly occupied China's Liaoning Province, and even all of the four northeastern provinces on September 18, 1931. Due to the success of the adventurous attempt, it was reflected in Japanese politics: first, the decline of party politics and the rise of the military; second, the chaebols, whose main component was the military industry, rose up to become the backing of the military. From then on, the Japanese military became the darling of the times, regarding China as no man's land and the Chinese nation as [censored].</p>
<p>However, the more Japanese imperialism intensified its aggression against China, the more solid the internal unity of China became. After the September 18th Incident, the slogan "Sincere unity, going to the national crisis together" became popular throughout the country, and the strength of the War of Resistance was concentrated. However, the Japanese aggression was endless. After the Tanggu Truce, China still maintained its burden of humiliation and humiliation, and negotiated with Japan, stopped military action, and used peaceful methods to first seek the preservation of the northern provinces, and then seek a reasonable solution to the problem of the four northeastern provinces, politically maintaining the integrity of sovereignty and administration; and economically taking mutual benefit and equality as the principle of cooperation. However, Japanese imperialism, oblivious to the trend of the world, in this era of the surging tide of "national self-determination" and "nationalism," vainly attempted to swallow up China, which has a population of 450 million, with a country with a population of 70 million. Finally, in July 1937, it suddenly attacked Lugou Bridge with force and occupied my Tianjin. The lifeline of China's life was at stake, and it had reached the critical point of survival. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to rise up and resist the war and seek survival from death. Therefore, the unprecedented national war of resistance in Chinese history broke out like a raging fire.</p>
<p>2. The Significance of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building</p>
<p>The purpose of China's war of resistance this time is to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism in order to save the dying of the country and the people; at the same time, to intensify work in the war of resistance to complete the task of nation-building. Why do we want to advance the war of resistance and nation-building at the same time? In the declaration of the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang on April 1, 1938, there was such an indication:</p>
<p>"Our war of resistance this time is not only to save the country, but also to prevent the great cause of nation-building from being interrupted. Moreover, the great cause of nation-building must not wait until the victory of the war of resistance to start again, but is a constant process in the war of resistance. We must gather the manpower and material resources of the whole country in the war of resistance to go to the same goal and deeply plant the foundation of nation-building. Then the day of victory in the war of resistance will be the day when the great cause of nation-building is completed, and the day when China is free and equal.... For without war of resistance, the survival and independence of the nation cannot be guaranteed, and there will be no way to carry out the great cause of nation-building: and without nation-building, self-reliance cannot be fulfilled, how can we resist foreign aggression and seek final victory?"</p>
<p>As long as we can study the highest guiding principle of the Three People's Principles, then the mutual assistance and mutual assistance of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building to the bottom is a necessary principle. This war of resistance is a total mobilization of the nation's mind and material resources, and it is also the total final of the nation's mind and material resources, so we must make the following efforts:</p>
<p>(1) Concentrating People's Power - During this war of resistance, we must recognize that only by basing ourselves on the principle of nationalism, developing the inherent morality of the nation, restoring the nation's self-confidence, and uniting the minds of the 450 million people into one mind, as solid as gold and stone, can people's power be concentrated and the strength of the war of resistance be fulfilled.</p>
<p>(2) Developing People's Power - The victory or defeat of the War of Resistance depends not only on military strength, but also on people's power. Therefore, we must organize the people and train the people. The purpose of organization and training is to cultivate the people's self-defense ability and self-government ability. These two have the same importance. Without self-defense ability, then self-government will have no room for development and growth: without self-government ability, then self-defense will inevitably lose its reliance. During this war of resistance, we must organize and train the people in the spirit of the principle of people's rights, and then the people's self-defense and self-government power can be developed, which is also the development of people's power.</p>
<p>(3) Fulfilling People's Power - The War of Resistance is a total mobilization and final of mental and material resources, as mentioned earlier. To develop material resources and fulfill material resources, we must adjust and develop agriculture, industry, and commerce to lay the economic foundation for the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. Specifically: First, the people of the whole country should be extremely frugal and hardworking, accumulate production capital, and revitalize industry. Second, all our agricultural revitalization plans must be based on the premise of the War of Resistance. Third, in economic construction, the government implements planned economy according to the credo of the principle of people's livelihood. If the government and the people can cooperate in implementing the above three points, the strength of the war of resistance will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>We take the Three People's Principles as the highest guiding principle of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, and we must also practice it by ourselves, overcome difficulties, and move forward, then the War of Resistance will be victorious, and Nation-Building will be successful, which is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>3. War of Resistance and Nation-Building and the Cultivation of National Morality</p>
<p>The last and most important determining factor of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building is the issue of national morality. What national morality shows is national spirit, and how important is it? Chairman Chiang said: "Our revolutionary army must have a special revolutionary spirit to resist the tyrannical force and superior material resources of foreign enemies when fighting against the counter-revolutionary army and the army of the invaded country against the invading country." "The spirit is the mother of all successes and the driving force of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building." "And the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance lies entirely in the spirit."</p>
<p>The so-called revolutionary spirit is the spirit of "becoming extinct" and "becoming things." "Becoming extinct" contains the spirit of "being fond of learning," "self-improvement," "humility," "creation," and "progress." "Becoming things" contains the spirit of "creation," "service," "progress," "sacrifice," and "struggle." The above eight spirits are born from the three "wisdom," "benevolence," and "courage." "Wisdom," "benevolence," and "courage" are the virtues of the world. Therefore, the so-called national morality problem we have put forward is obviously also the problem of "wisdom, benevolence, and courage." Now, let's explore them separately:</p>
<p>(1) The meaning of "wisdom" is to use the functions of innate intelligence (sharpness of ears), brightness (sharpness of eyes), tolerance (sharpness of intention), and knowledge (sharpness of heart) to obtain it through three ways: The first is to know from birth, which is due to "innate." The second is "to know from learning," which is from "knowledge." The third is "to know from difficulties," which is from experience. However, those who "know from birth" are ultimately a very small number of people, which are the so-called people who have unique learning. Most people need to know after learning. Speaking of learning, it is not easy. You must be fond of learning and learn in difficulties before you can succeed. The so-called "being fond of learning is close to wisdom" means that seeking knowledge must be fond of learning. Secondly, seeking knowledge must be humble, which is the so-called "Lu Huai Ruo Gu," because "the most Lu in the world is the most sincere in the world." Only with sincerity can one be humble, and only with humility can one seek progress!</p>
<p>What is the purpose of "wisdom"? The first is to judge right and wrong based on objective conditions and subjective understanding, so it is said: "The heart of right and wrong is the beginning of wisdom." The second is to know "benevolence," that is, to understand the truth of being a human being. This truth of being a human being is to seek the success of a career with the view of life of creation and service, that is, becoming a thing, so it is said: "Becoming a thing is wisdom."</p>
<p>If we can improve and deepen our cultivation of "wisdom," then our understanding of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building will be clear, and our beliefs will be more resolute. There is no doubt that we will win and succeed.</p>
<p>(2) "Benevolence" includes "creative spirit" and "service spirit." From "creative spirit" to "love things," from "service spirit" to "benevolence to the people," this is the so-called "benevolence to the people and love things." "The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence." Also, "benevolence" is a kind of active action, so it is said: "Practice is close to benevolence." The purpose of this active action lies in "Wei Wu," that is, seeking the success of a career. Otherwise, even if you sacrifice everything, you will not hesitate, so [censored] said: "If you don't succeed, you will become benevolent." Wen Tianxiang said: "Confucius said becoming benevolent, Mencius said taking righteousness. Only when righteousness is exhausted can benevolence be reached." Because to become things, one has to sacrifice small things for the sake of the big group, so "killing oneself to become benevolent." Now that [censored] is in front of us, the tragedy of the massacre of compatriots, the occupation of land, the deprivation of sovereignty, and the destruction of the nation and the country are like the eternal depths of fire and heat. We can no longer endure it for a moment. At this turning point of fortune and misfortune, in order to seek the success of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building (becoming things), we must strive to create, strive to serve, and finally even kill ourselves to become benevolent (becoming oneself). Do not seek to live to harm [censored]. "If the people have no such heart of benevolence and love, they will inevitably fall into cruelty, sell themselves to selfishness, and then indulge in violence and laziness, and return to steal life and live in fear. They will not be moved by the survival of the family and the nation, their personal personality will no longer exist, and the vitality of the country will be lost. How can we resist the war? How can we build the country?" (Official words of the Provisional National Congress) If the people can cultivate the "benevolence" with great intention and put it into practice, then the people's hearts will be rejuvenated, and the atmosphere will be formed. The War of Resistance and Nation-Building will be sure to succeed.</p>
<p>(3) "Courage" includes the spirit of progress, the spirit of sacrifice, and the spirit of struggle. Doing righteous (becoming oneself and becoming things) things based on these three spirits is courage, so it is said: "Seeing righteousness and acting bravely." The Japanese imperialism's aggression against China is our great shame and humiliation. We know this shame, so we started the War of Resistance. This is "courage," so it is said: "Knowing shame is close to courage." It is also said: "Making shame clear and teaching war." Compatriots! Rise up with the spirit of progress, sacrifice, and struggle, and strive to wipe out shame and resist the war and build the country.</p>
<p>"Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the virtues of the world, and the one who practices them is one, and one is sincerity.... Sincerity is to choose goodness and hold on to it. Compatriots! Liu Ci's deep intention, then the nation's mind and material resources can be fulfilled, and the War of Resistance and Nation-Building can be surely won and surely achieved."</p>
<h3>The Current Youth's Way Out (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Feng Wenbin's Speech</p>
<p>(2) Special Airmail News from Xi'an</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen answered this point in advance before he passed away. He said: "Before the Han people regained their country, the general party members thought that once the Han people regained their country, they could achieve the goal of benefiting the country and the people. Today, we know that this is not the case. The reason for this is that the comrades at that time only knew about the principle of nationalism and ignored the mistakes of the principles of democracy and people's livelihood, and this mistake is also where the party's responsibility has not ended. We must know that if the principle of democracy and the principle of people's livelihood cannot be implemented, even if the principle of nationalism achieves its goal, it will not be stable in the end; not to mention that the principle of nationalism has not fully achieved its goal today!" So he affirmed: "To solve the national problem, we must also solve the problem of democracy; to solve the problem of democracy, we must also solve the problem of people's livelihood."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang also said, "The Three People's Principles are a whole, and cannot be split; the Chinese National Revolution is not a revolution of one principle, but a revolution of the Three People's Principles promoted at the same time."</p>
<p>The reason why the Outline of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building stipulates the protection of people's rights is the conclusion that should be reached from the premise of the Three People's Principles. However, some people misinterpret it, saying that what it stipulates is only the right of the law, not the right of the people, because it protects people's rights only within the scope of the law, and the law can be stretched freely. This view is also wrong. If governments at all levels protect the people's thoughts and beliefs regardless of whether they violate the highest principles of the Three People's Principles, and if they do not want to protect them, they will ban them. This is just playing with the integrity and dignity of the law. All laws must abide by the principles of the Three People's Principles to be correct laws. If governments at all levels can formulate laws at any time and place at will, and arbitrarily judge whether the people are legal or illegal, then what is the significance of our Outline of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building?</p>
<p>The third condition is that we have rich historical lessons. Our sages and elders have long told us: "Brothers read in the [censored], and resist their insults from the outside." The clams fight, and the beans are fried in the kettle, which has always been regarded as the greatest stupidity. We have not only been influenced by this excellent national tradition since childhood, but also proved its correctness in our own experience.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth have had twenty years of struggle history. The precious experience of the past twenty years has proved that unity is happiness, and division is disaster. The memory of victory and the painful wounds are still very fresh to us. We have understood the necessity of seeking unity and avoiding division, and we have also learned many practical ways to seek unity and avoid division.</p>
<p>The fourth condition is that we have received help from many domestic elders and foreign friends. The central and local military and political elders, the leaders of various anti-Japanese parties, and the advanced people of high reputation in all walks of life, their support, love, guidance, and guidance for our youth are what we will always be grateful for. The International Youth United Front has given us Chinese youth a very good example in many aspects. Young people in Britain, France, the United States, and other countries are moving towards unity under the common goal of anti-war and anti-fascism. Young people in all countries are very concerned about the unified front of Chinese youth. The two World Youth Conferences and the visit of the World Affairs Federation delegation to China have all had a significant role in promoting our unity and unity.</p>
<p>Sixth, we have young cadres who are loyal to the youth united front. These cadres in our youth organizations have political sensitivity and foresight, and have all kinds of necessary talents and perseverance. Almost everywhere, our cadres can walk in front of ordinary young people and can be good friends of ordinary young people. When ordinary young people are tired and depressed, our cadres will give them strong encouragement. When ordinary young people lose their way, our cadres will give them firm and clear instructions. All their energy is dedicated to the youth united front. In our [censored] special in Fujian, we can name such people by the thousands. They are the people who worry about the world before the world worries, and who are happy after the world is happy. As long as they are helpful to the cause of youth unity and resistance to the war, they are not afraid of any [censored] and [censored]. This is the unparalleled glory of our youth team. (Applause)</p>
<p>Finally, one advantage of our youth united front is that our youth are very frank, pure, and clean, without any worldly prejudices. We say what we think should be said, and we do what we think should be done. We take personal interests very lightly. We are all very enthusiastic about the work of teaching the country and saving the [censored], which makes us naturally unite.</p>
<p>With these superior conditions, who can stop the development of our united front? Even if someone dreams of stopping it, isn't it a waste of effort?</p>
<h3>New Internal Affairs Facilities in the War of Resistance and Nation-Building</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail News] For more than a year, although the government has been actively resisting the war, it has also been actively developing various internal affairs facilities in the rear, hoping to cooperate with the military. There are four aspects that are particularly emphasized: (1) Regarding hygiene, there is a special office to handle everything, and the progress is the fastest. The health [censored] of each province have been established one after another, as well as the health experimental offices. Recently, in view of the relatively backwardness of the border provinces, the Northwest Health Commissioner's Office has been established in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and 800,000 yuan of regular expenses have been approved for the use of eight months this year to facilitate implementation. A health institute has also been established in Xikang. Along the highways in the rear, health stations have also been set up, and medical teams have been set up to spread all over the road to relieve the lack of internal medical and epidemic prevention facilities. (2) Regarding opium suppression, planting has long been strictly prohibited, and it was stipulated that planting should be completely banned by the end of last year. Recently, it is still feared that there will be secret planting in various places, so special teams have been organized to investigate and survey planting in various places. Sichuan organized an investigation team by the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs provided guidance. Other provinces were inspected separately by personnel sent by the Opium Suppression Committee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Sichuan investigation team will be able to depart soon. This year, smoking must also be strictly prohibited. Selling and smoking places will be banned. Except for the elderly over 60 years old, smoking is now listed as a ban. (3) Regarding police administration, the work of unified command and uniform training is being carried out. All police training institutes in various provinces and cities are subsidized by the Ministry of Internal Affairs with funds ranging from 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per school per year. The directors of teaching affairs are also generally selected by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In this way, the training standards can be made more uniform. (4) Regarding civil affairs, the reform of the provincial and county administrative organs is now being carried out to make them sound. The reform measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and are still being submitted to the Central Political Committee for review. The reform principles are: First, to change the provincial government into a supervisory unit in administration. Second, to strengthen the power of the administrative supervisors, so that they are directly responsible to the central government for commanding local administration, and at the same time directly responsible to the provincial government's supervisory system for supervising the county governments. Third, to increase the power of the county magistrates and give them considerable protection. Those with a population of more than 500,000 are listed as special counties. Fourth, to change the district and township Baojia system to adapt to the new institutions. These new measures will be implemented around June of this year. As for the war zone administration, in addition to the provincial governments still leading and supervising each province, the central government has specially set up a Party and Government Committee. In case of war zone administrative matters, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will handle them together. The administrative districts in the occupied areas, such as Weihaiwei and Jiujiang, are still properly and directly handled. The original police in each war zone have been registered, relieved, trained, and reorganized to take on the local guerrilla work.</p>

<h3>The Hunan-Hubei Enemy Offensive Has Exhausted; Our Troops in Northern Jiangxi Launch a Successful Counterattack; The Occupied Areas of North China Are in a Frenzy of Mobilization</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Zhuangqing, 20th] Because of their failed offensives in Hubei and Hunan, the enemy is now almost entirely on the defensive on various battlefields. Therefore, the overall situation has been relatively quiet recently. However, the enemy is quite busy with mobilization in the occupied areas of North China. The majority of the enemy in central Hubei is concentrated in the Dabie Mountains, Zhongxiang, Xihe, Yingcheng, Jingshan, and Yingshan areas. We have completely controlled them, and there have been constant small-scale engagements. The Xiang River bank is extremely quiet. In this offensive in northern Hunan, the enemy suffered 1,300 casualties, and their offensive has been exhausted. There has been no major engagement in Jiangxi. East of Gao'an and Wuning, near Nanchang, we have constantly attacked the enemy, achieving considerable success.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 29th] Currently, there are four enemy gunboats, four transport ships, four submarines, and more than forty motorboats anchored on the Yueyang River. At 9:00 AM on the 29th, two enemy boats sailed from Yueyang to the border of Huarong for reconnaissance and then immediately retreated.</p>
<p>Frequent Reports of Victory from Hebei and Shandong</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] The enemy has recently claimed to "pacify" Jiaodong, but our guerrilla forces are strong and there is no cause for concern. Yesterday, our units attacked Muping and entered the city, burning down the puppet county government. The enemy fled in disarray to the east gate. They also used four aircraft to assist in the battle. Because our objective had been achieved, we safely withdrew. Furthermore, our security team completely annihilated the puppet army regiment of Zhao Yanhan in Shenzhuang and Zhuying Road, Dong'a County. Zhao was also killed in action. More than 700 enemy troops from Jining and Wenshang attacked Macun, Wenshang, but were repelled. Our troops in various parts of Hebei also have occasional engagements with the enemy. We control most counties. The enemy in Hebei and Shandong is forcibly collecting land taxes from the people and forcing villages to use puppet currency, causing extreme public resentment. Many Japanese and puppet soldiers have been killed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 28th] Yesterday, the enemy in southern Shanxi launched an offensive towards Xiaganquan and Wuziguanzhuang. After a fierce counterattack by our troops, the enemy was unable to withstand the assault and fled towards Shicun. Our troops attacked Zhoujialuo and the enemy immediately collapsed upon contact, fleeing westward and abandoning much heavy weaponry and military supplies. We have taken advantage of the victory to pursue them. At the same time, our troops advanced towards Yicheng Avenue, cutting off the enemy's retreat. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate the remaining enemy forces.</p>

Under the cover of twelve enemy aircraft, they fought with us for several days. The enemy suffered more than 100 casualties. Due to the enemy's intense artillery fire, to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, we shifted our positions to villages near Hanlin Longtang and continued to resist the enemy. Also, on the 16th, the enemy attacked Xinyu, Tunchang, engaging us in three days and nights of bloody combat. They are currently still in a stalemate with us in the Xinyu Tunchang area. Yesterday at 8:00 AM, the enemy from Penglai and Dingan split into two routes, using aircraft and more than ten tanks to cover their attack on Huangzhu (under Qiongdong).

<h3>The Tibetan People's Comfort Mission Sends a Telegram to Salute the Soldiers Across the Country, Donating Medical Supplies and Comfort Funds of 9,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] A mission from Tibet, consisting of monks and laypeople, traveled to Chongqing to express their condolences to the soldiers fighting the war of resistance.

<p>Shanghai Traitor Newspaper Attacks Britain</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 29th] Today's editorial in the "New Shen Bao," under Japanese control, claimed that Britain is now using its "traditional policy of killing two birds with one stone. At the same time as the Anglo-Soviet alliance has been completed, Britain has been urging the Soviet Union to go to war with Japan. The recent Outer Mongolian border incident is likely the result of British instigation. The Japanese authorities will certainly teach Britain a lesson." The newspaper concluded by saying, "If Britain's anti-Japanese plan succeeds, then several more countries will be sacrificed."</p>
<h3>Sino-British Relations Becoming Closer; Shanghai Residents Stop Commemorating the May 30th Incident to Express Sino-British Friendship</h3>

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Advertises the Opening of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 29th] According to the Japanese Domei News Agency, today's "Miyako Shimbun" stated that the Japanese government has decided to reopen the Yangtze River to allow shipping by third countries. Since the Japanese naval authorities closed the Yangtze River, various countries have been negotiating with Japan almost daily. The Japanese government has indeed decided to open the river, but the Japanese military officers in the "local area" still oppose implementing it at present. Therefore, the date of opening may be postponed until the autumn of this year. There are five important tasks for Japan before opening the river: (1) implementing a backing currency policy; (2) improving shipping and port facilities; (3) adjusting economic relations with the people in the Chinese hinterland (?); (4) maintaining public order; (5) restricting foreign shipping. The "Miyako Shimbun" also stated that the issue of opening the Yangtze River is closely related to the issue of concessions in China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Shanghai dispatch: British Ambassador Kerr, accompanied by Admiral Jubal, arrived in Shanghai on the British cruiser Birmingham at 9:00 AM on the 29th, sailing from Xiamen.

The commander of the American Asiatic Fleet also arrived here on the American cruiser Marblehead on the morning of the 29th. Now the ambassadors and army and navy commanders of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, have gathered in Shanghai.

It is rumored that the officials have already held an important meeting to discuss general issues related to Japan and to strengthen cooperation between the three countries. It is also heard that the heads of the three countries' consulates in Shanghai also participated in the talks.</p>
<h3>German Mail Ship Also Intercepted and Searched by the Japanese; German Consul in Shanghai Protests; Both Sides Attempt to Conceal the Matter; Truth Revealed After the Ship Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Local news] Recently, Japanese warships have been rampant along our country's coast, wantonly inspecting foreign merchant ships. In the past week alone, three ships have been searched by the Japanese. In addition to the news about the British mail ship "Rampurra" and the French mail ship "Aline Mesurier," which has already been reported, the incident involving the German mail ship "Sulten," which was also searched by a Japanese warship on the 24th of this month, has not yet been published. Relevant parties in this port have also not disclosed this information. According to a Western report from this port yesterday, the German mail ship that was searched by the Japanese warship was the "Sulten," weighing 7,087 tons, owned by the German Hamburg Shipping Company. On the 24th of this month, it was sailing about one mile outside this port when it encountered a Japanese destroyer coming head-on and signaled it to stop. The ship's captain immediately obeyed and stopped. Soon, a group of Japanese sailors, about ten in number, led by an officer, approached the ship in a motorboat, then climbed aboard to inspect the ship's cargo of paper goods and important documents, etc. They also asked where the ship was coming from, where it was going, and whether it was a German merchant ship. After about 20 minutes, the Japanese soldiers left the ship and returned to their warship, and the "Sulten" continued sailing to Shanghai. Regarding the ship's search incident, the Japanese and German authorities in this port and Shanghai have not reported it, but it is rumored that the German Consul General has protested to the Japanese side. However, this news has yet to be confirmed. Furthermore, it is found that the location of this German ship's search is the same as that of the French ship's search.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Shanghai dispatch: According to the English-language Continental Daily News, after the French mail ship Aline Mesurier was inspected by the Japanese on the 24th of this month, the German ship Sulten, which was sailing from Germany to Shanghai, was also intercepted by Japanese warships, and the Japanese boarded the ship to inspect documents. After 20 minutes, they left. The German Consul General in Shanghai has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities. Relevant parties attempted to conceal this matter, but it was eventually revealed. After the Sulten arrived in Shanghai, the full truth of the incident was revealed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Informally Express Cessation of Intercepting Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 29th] A Japanese naval spokesman, meeting with journalists tonight, guaranteed that there will be no more incidents like "Rampurra," "Aline Mesurier," and "Sulten." However, he said, "The Japanese naval authorities will still board and inspect the documents of any ship deemed suspicious." Furthermore, when answering questions, the spokesman pointed out that there is currently no blockade of the Chinese coast, saying that the Japanese navy only wants to stop Chinese ships from sailing, but third-country flags are often misused, so it is sometimes necessary to search them for verification. From June 1st, the Shanghai Customs will refuse to issue export sailing permits for ships sailing to Haimen, Qidong, Xingang, Zhangzhou, and Funing, etc. It is heard that the purpose is to cut off supplies to the Chinese guerrilla forces in these ports.</p>
<h3>Coastal Zhejiang Implements Blockade; Wenzhou-Taizhou Authorities Notify Shipping Merchants</h3>

They have notified all shipping merchants to prohibit any ship from sailing or passing within the blockade port's zone. Violators will be arrested and punished without leniency.</p>
<h3>Shaoguan Air Raid Destroys Dozens of Homes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Shaoguan, 29th] Starting at 9:00 AM on the 29th, seventeen enemy aircraft bombed Shaoguan. The first batch of eight aircraft dropped bombs in areas such as West River Road, Fengdu Road, Minsheng Road, Xindongmen, and North Straight Street. The second batch of nine aircraft bombed the Shako River waterfront. Dozens of bombs were dropped, destroying only dozens of homes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 29th] At 3:35 PM on the 28th, ten enemy aircraft, in three groups, attacked areas in northern Guangdong. They dropped several bombs in Yingde and three bombs in Xiachun Village near Sanjiangxu, Fogang, killing and wounding ten villagers and destroying two homes. Also, on the 20th, twelve enemy aircraft took off from Qionghai and dropped six bombs on Suixi Jiangjiaoluzhen, all landing in the fields.</p>
<h3>Central Memorial Week; Chairman Feng Yuxiang Reports</h3>

<h3>Soviet-Japanese Air Battle South of Manzhouli; The Enemy Repeatedly Loses in the Invasion of China and Falsely Reports Battle Results to Deceive the People</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 29th] A Japanese army spokesman claimed that this conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in Manchuria was far more intense than the Changkufeng Incident.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 29th] The Japanese officially announced that yesterday the Japanese Air Force and 100 Soviet Air Force military aircraft engaged in an air battle south of Manzhouli. As a result, 42 Soviet aircraft were shot down, while one Japanese aircraft was damaged.

<h3>Scenic Spots of Lanzhou (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jun Sui</p>
<p>Travels in Xinjiang, Episode 5</p>
<p>Visiting the Peach Blossom Forest in Shijiawan</p>
<p>As arranged by Mr. Zheng Xiangchen of the Bank of China, we took a car early in the morning of the 18th to visit Shijiawan, about 30 li from the city, where the famous peach blossom forest of Lanzhou is located. Tens of thousands of peach trees are planted in the middle of nearly a thousand mu of farmland. Looking at it from a distance, it looks like a pink sea, which is truly beautiful.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Iron Bridge</p>
<p>After the car left the city, it passed a Guandi Temple. With gates to the north and south and a paifang in front, the temple looks extremely majestic and is currently occupied by a government agency. After passing the ancient temple is the famous Yellow River Iron Bridge, built three years before the founding of the Republic of China. It was ordered from an American bridge company by Sheng Yun, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu during the Guangxu era of the late Qing Dynasty. This bridge has long exceeded its warranty period, but the authorities do not have the resources to rebuild it, so they still allow cars weighing less than seven tons to pass, which is really too dangerous. Looking north from the bridge, Baitashan (White Pagoda Mountain) stands tall, with the white pagoda towering independently on the top of the mountain. From the mountain's base to its peak, it is covered with temples, including the Ten Kings of Hell, worshiped in small temples. This shows the past superstition of the people of Lanzhou.</p>
<p>The Lanzhou Mint</p>
<p>The road on the north bank was originally the highway from Lanzhou to Qinghai and Xinjiang. Recently, with the government's barter trade with the Soviet Union, it has become an important route for transportation between the two countries. However, the road surface has not been repaired. The loose yellow soil is so deep that it can submerge the axle. Mountain stones sink into the gray soil, making driving very difficult. The road runs parallel to the Yellow River. Not far from the Yellow River Iron Bridge, two water mills stand side by side, with large stoves towering high. Mr. Zheng said that this is the Lanzhou Mint, also built during the late Qing Dynasty. Further ahead, every half li or so, there is a fort, and the forts are connected by mud walls. According to Mr. Zheng, these are the remnants of defensive walls built by Zuo Zongtang during the suppression of the Hui Rebellion. The farmland along the Yellow River is mostly stony, but because it is irrigated with waterwheels, the land is extremely fertile. White poplars and green willows on both banks add to the beauty of the scene. On the vast expanse of yellow soil, the addition of verdant colors makes one forget the desolate scenery, showing that human determination can overcome nature and that developing the Northwest is not impossible.</p>
<p>The Peach Blossom Forest in Shijiawan</p>
<p>When the car arrived at Shijiawan, we got out and walked, taking a large circle around the peach blossom forest. In the densest part of the peach forest, it looks like a pink cloud. Each peach tree has densely layered blossoms, with deep red stamens and pink petals, truly a vibrant sight. It looks similar to the blooming plum blossoms of Meiyuan in Wuxi, but the planting method is similar to the plum orchards of Licun in Qingdao, because only a few trees are planted on each mu of land. However, because the number of mu planted is too large, it appears endless. The roadsides are interspersed with plum trees, which have also blossomed, creating a red and white intermingling effect that adds to the elegance. There are also jujube trees, which have not yet bloomed, their branches twisted and turning, adding to the charm. Most of the peach trees in the peach forest have short trunks and lack grace, but there are also several trees with old trunks and winding branches, comparable to the old plum trees of Chaoshan.</p>
<p>The Hardships of the Farmers</p>
<p>On the road in the middle of the peach forest, we saw a large cart pulled by a mule and a donkey. The road was steep, and the mule was exhausted and refused to move forward. The cart driver whipped it repeatedly, but to no avail, and he was so anxious that he shed tears. Mr. Zheng chatted with him and learned that the cart was carrying crushed stone, which could be exchanged for three yuan in national currency in Lanzhou City. If he could not reach the city today, not only would he have nothing to eat, but also nowhere to get grass for the animals. That is why he was so anxious that he was crying. The hardships of the laborers in the Northwest are beyond the imagination of the people in the Southeast. People often talk emptily about developing the Northwest, but they have not delved into the lives of the people in the Northwest. How can they know the poverty of the people in the Northwest? Ahead, we saw a small village, and we went over to talk to the villagers, learning that they were the farmers of the peach forest. Each family has dozens of peach trees, each worth only about one yuan, indicating that even when the fruit ripens, it is not worth much. Their daughters still have their feet bound from a young age. We advised the mothers to stop binding their daughters' feet, and some of them agreed.</p>
<p>The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway</p>
<p>There we met the foreman of the Tongcheng Company, which is building the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, and learned that the section of the highway near Lanzhou has started to be paved with stones and will be completed in about one or two months. In the future, when we return to Shijiawan, we will no longer have to endure the hardship of traveling on a rugged and uneven road from the primitive era. We often say that the Northwest Highway is our international route for communication with the Soviet Union, but unexpectedly, the road 20 or 30 li from Lanzhou is still a mule cart road from the primitive era. This shows that those who talk about construction have always focused on developing the Southeast. If we now want to step up the construction of the Northwest, we will face a situation of stretching ourselves too thin. However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If we can catch up quickly and start by focusing on transportation, the other construction projects will naturally be solved easily. Sun Yat-sen's construction plan originally designated Lanzhou as the center of China's railway network. We should now make Lanzhou the intersection of Northwest transportation, as well as the liaison station for transportation in the Southwest and Northeast, and the starting and ending station for Sino-Soviet international transportation. The first step is to improve the highways, the second step is to adjust the air routes, and the third step is to build the railways. At the same time, we should rush to extend the Longhai Railway to Lanzhou before there is a possibility of implementing Sun Yat-sen's plan.</p>
<h3>河內視察</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent Report from the People's Revolutionary Society, Hanoi] Hanoi, the capital of Annam, is perhaps not well-known in ordinary times to many people, except for those with special interests there. But since the Wang Jingwei incident, where he fled to Hanoi, many people's attention has shifted to it.</p>
<p>The streets of Hanoi have a French flavor. Except for Guangdong Street and a few streets inhabited by the Annamese, the roads are wide, with trees densely planted on both sides, providing shade like a large umbrella over those moving on the streets. Cicadas and various summer insects chime in the shade, resembling a clear symphony. The Western-style houses are not very large, and are often widely spaced, leaving open spaces for gardens. This is due to the hot weather. There are streetcars, not like the double-decker ones in Hong Kong, but like those in Shanghai, with two carriages. The total population is 150,000, mostly Annamese, followed by the French. There are only about 4,000 overseas Chinese, less than in Saigon and Haiphong (Saigon has tens of thousands, and Haiphong has over 8,000). After the Wang incident, the reporter became quite interested in Hanoi, and thus made this trip there. After arriving in Hanoi, the reporter visited the Chinese Consul-General in Hanoi and various overseas Chinese figures, inquiring in detail about the current living conditions of the overseas Chinese, the dynamics of the anti-Japanese national salvation work, the activities of the Wang faction, and the attitudes of the overseas Chinese towards Wang, among other issues. To summarize what was learned from the visits, the current living conditions of the overseas Chinese are generally not bad. They are very enthusiastic about donating funds to save the country. They have national salvation organizations and frugal meal societies, donating their savings each month to the consulate for remittance to Hong Kong, to be forwarded to the central government. Intellectuals often hold fundraising performances to aid refugees. However, firstly, the overseas Chinese population is too small, with small merchants and workers making up the majority; and secondly, the educational level of the overseas Chinese is relatively low. Generally speaking, it is undeniable that the overseas Chinese here are quite scattered. Indeed, it is probably not accidental that Wang chose to come to this place of all places. Perhaps he calculated that the minds of the overseas Chinese here are as simple and pure as blank paper, easy to grasp, and then decided to flee to Hanoi. However, this was his miscalculation. For the sake of livelihood, the overseas Chinese in Hanoi and even throughout Vietnam, who are in a colonial situation, have a love for their motherland that is no less than that of the overseas Chinese in other regions. Their enthusiastic donations for national salvation and the vigorous development of national salvation work are ironclad proof of this. They are unanimously indignant and opposed to Wang. They unconditionally support the central government, the supreme leader, and the basic national policy of protracted resistance. Their confidence in the inevitable victory of the war of resistance and the inevitable success of national reconstruction is as solid as iron. However, this is not to say that there are no scoundrels among the overseas Chinese here, which no one wants to deny. Perhaps due to the above reasons, the Wang faction is very active here, and their scope of activities is not limited to this one corner, but has spread to various parts of Vietnam and Siam. The reporter happened to read a communication from Wangluo in the "Vietnam News" column of the May 16th Vietnam Daily, titled "Traitors Who Sell Out the Country Randomly Distribute Propaganda," the article detailed the seditious activities of the Wang faction to incite the overseas Chinese, the reporter has transcribed it in full, word for word, for the readers:</p>

<h3>Anti-Aggression Negotiations Proceeding Tortuously, Rumor of Soviet Union Presenting Counter-Proposals Again, Alliance Could Greatly Increase Strength</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] According to political circles here, Stalin personally studied the Anglo-French proposals. This news is enough to indicate that the negotiations have reached their final stage. Whether the tripartite alliance can be established depends on the Soviet Union's decision. However, according to another source, Stalin does not want to accept the current Anglo-French proposals, and wants to present counter-proposals again. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will return to London at the end of this week, and Foreign Secretary Halifax will return to London on Wednesday or Thursday, which is enough to indicate that the British government knows that the Soviet Union must study the Anglo-French documents for a long time before it can reply.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] As of last night, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, had not yet reported to the British government the results of the meetings on Saturday and Sunday with the French Chargé d'affaires to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Political circles here also do not know when Ambassador Seeds will report to the British government, only saying that Stalin personally studied the Anglo-French documents in detail on Saturday night.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] Yesterday's Paris noon newspapers reported that if Japan joins the military alliance, the clauses in the current Anglo-Soviet-French agreement that stipulate automatic military mutual assistance in Europe will also be extended to the Far East. All the evening newspapers in Paris said that the talks currently underway in Moscow are extremely satisfactory, that the British and French ambassadors and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are in agreement, and that Stalin also wishes to cooperate fully and closely with Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 29th] The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union delivered the British proposals to the Soviet government last Saturday and Sunday. Britain is now awaiting the Soviet response. Once the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is completed, the three countries will be stronger than they were in 1914. Although general experts believe that the danger of war still exists, they feel that after two months of diplomatic activity, the balance of power in the international arena has now shifted in favor of the anti-aggression group. No one dares to say that the Axis powers have abandoned their aggressive ambitions. Hitler's future actions will first expand the German-Italian military alliance, and then extend to Spain and Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday for one hour. British diplomatic circles believe that the Anglo-French-Soviet anti-aggression defense group can be completed within a few days. How the strength of the Soviet Union is has always been kept secret, but according to sources claiming to be well-informed, the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet defense alliance is equivalent to an increase in the military strength of the peace front, with 16 million people who can be mobilized, of which 10 million have been trained and are able to use the latest weapons and follow new combat methods. The Soviet Union currently has 5 million trained troops, serving in the regular army or in the reserve army. This reserve army was established in August 1923, and has now become a powerful force. In addition, the Soviet Union has a second reserve army, whose members are all those who have served in the regular army or reserve army. They are also subject to the military authorities until they are 40 years old. The Soviet Union also conscripts 75,000 people into the navy and air force each year. Conscripts must undergo military training for ten weeks each year during the period from 16 to 18 years old. After retiring from the regular army, they are incorporated into the reserve army until the age of 40, and then automatically returned to the supplementary service. The Soviet Union also intends to develop plans for wartime mobilization and transportation.</p>
<p>[London, 29th] According to reports arriving here from Paris, if the negotiations for the conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet three-nation alliance encounter further difficulties, the totalitarian countries may soon have new acts of aggression. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, influenced by some powerful quarters, is unwilling to conclude a formal alliance with the Soviet Union, which has delayed the Anglo-Soviet negotiations for two months without complete success. Pro-German Britons fear that once the Anglo-Soviet alliance is completed, Hitler's diplomatic failure may lead to the collapse of his regime and give rise to Bolshevism in Germany. The French side, led by Premier Daladier, has been warned by the French General Staff regarding the negotiations for the conclusion of the three-nation alliance. If an anti-aggression front is not established quickly, the General Staff will not be responsible for national defense, so they must do their utmost to win over Britain and the Soviet Union. Chamberlain had still believed that Italy could be won over, but after Germany and Italy signed a military alliance last month, he realized that it was hopeless. This was also a major blow to pro-German leaders in Britain, such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Home Secretary Hoare, and Chamberlain's advisor Wilson. A well-known weekly in London wrote last week, declaring that if the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations are successfully concluded and a three-nation mutual assistance alliance is signed, Germany's dream of dominating Europe will be shattered, the Axis powers will definitely be disappointed, and the peace front will be greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>[Hai Luo News Agency, Bucharest, 29th] According to well-informed sources, Romanian King Carol, who was reported to have gone to Ankara, has arrived in the province of Transylvania.

<h3>Fascist Party Members Incite Overseas Italians in France to Take the Opportunity to Disrupt the Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 28th] Former Secretary of the Italian Fascist Party, Farinacci, recently published an article in his organ newspaper "The Fascist Era," advising Italians living in France to take the opportunity to join French political parties, and then "wait for the right opportunity to create chaos and disrupt order in the heart of the enemy country. If a hundred people attack the enemy from behind, its effectiveness is far greater than a thousand soldiers fighting the enemy on the front line."</p>
<h3>British War Veterans Decide to Protect National Freedom, Will Rise Up and Fight If Attacked, Morris Speaks at Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] British veterans of the European War held their annual meeting today. Chairman Morris attended and addressed the meeting, saying that British veterans would be very willing to shake hands and make peace with German and Italian veterans if the German and Italian governments could allow them to do so. However, British veterans are still determined to rise up and fight to protect British freedom when their country is attacked. Morris continued that if the German and Italian press do not end their attacks on Britain, it will be difficult for British veterans to rebuild their friendly relations with them. He finally said, "Although we are willing to rebuild friendly relations with Germany and Italy, if our country is attacked, we will resist to the last man. If our freedom is threatened, we will fight for freedom, and if our allies are in trouble, we will also fight for them." After the speech, the thousand representatives gave him enthusiastic applause.</p>
<h3>Italy Currently Has No Intention of Provocation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 29th] According to Fascist sources close to Mussolini, Mussolini will not take excessive actions in order to endanger European peace. Although there are many clouds of war in Europe at present, Italy still hopes for lasting peace in Europe. This statement is enough to prove that Italy currently has no intention of provocation and hopes that Germany's actions towards Poland and Italy's actions towards France will not cause trouble. In addition, it also proves that Italy has no intention of abolishing the Anglo-Italian Agreement or signing another agreement to resist the Anglo-Turkish Agreement, and the rumor that Germany and Italy will soon put forward new demands on European issues is untrue.</p>
<h3>Many Shortcomings in Germany's Western Defense Line, Underground Forts Have Been Infiltrated by Water</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] German newspapers are currently boasting that the German-Italian Axis powers are strong and indestructible. The Berlin Börsen-Zeitung also claims that Germany's western Siegfried Line is impregnable, but according to news received by French newspapers, this defense line has many construction shortcomings. For example, the right-wing Paris Echo reported that a correspondent from The Hague called to say that according to reliable news, German leader Hitler recently inspected the Siegfried Line and discovered many shortcomings. For example, the underground forts have been infiltrated by water from the Rhine River, and the increased moisture and softness have caused the gun emplacements to sink. The cement used in the forts is of poor quality and cannot resist water, so the guards have had to withdraw. The experts led by Leader Hitler all believe that another defense line should be built three to five kilometers behind the first defense line. The Leader has dismissed the leaders of the National Defense Army engineering teams for this reason and ordered Air Minister Göring to conduct an investigation to determine where the responsibility lies. According to experts, if the Siegfried Line is to be rebuilt, it will take at least two or three years to complete.</p>
<h3>Discussion of British Commercial Interests in the Far East, Detailed Record of House of Commons Debate</h3>
<p>[London Air Express] Recently, British Members of Parliament Drummond-Hay and others raised questions about the issue of British commercial interests in the Far East, and Vice-Minister Butler answered on behalf of the government. The details are recorded as follows: (Drummond-Hay asked) If British merchants in China wish to travel freely between Shanghai and Hankou, I wonder if they can enjoy transportation conveniences. (Vice-Minister replied) On April 17 this year, about 20 passengers traveled from Shanghai to Hankou on a British ship, and on April 29, about 50 passengers traveled from Hankou to Shanghai. At that time, all British people going to Hankou traveled together, but it is currently difficult to restore a regular route. Negotiations on this matter are still ongoing with the Japanese authorities. (Drummond-Hay) Can I ask the government to raise this issue again with the Tokyo government and sternly urge them, saying that the closure of the Yangtze River has not only made British merchants feel very distressed, but their families have also suffered a lot. I also asked the government to contact the commander of the British fleet in China on March 13 regarding this matter. I wonder if discussions are still ongoing. (Vice-Minister replied) This type of contact has not stopped, and the government also understands the serious situation you mentioned. (Ealing Graham asked) The Japanese are launching organized anti-British propaganda in the occupied areas of China. I wonder if the government has paid attention to it. Is the information obtained by the government sufficient to prove that the aforementioned anti-British propaganda is incited by local Japanese officials? If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will harm the friendship between Japan and Britain. Has the government alerted the Japanese government to this?</p>
<p>(Vice-Minister replied) According to the recent report from the British Consul-General in Shanghai, he lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong at the beginning of last month, and the so-called anti-British propaganda has been somewhat relaxed. However, the government will continue to monitor this matter and will raise protests when necessary.</p>
<h3>British General Election Nears, Rumor That Chamberlain Will Resign, Ministers Will Also Be Replaced</h3>
<p>[Tonghai News Agency, London, 29th] The recent activities of the Conservative Party Executive Committee have caused great concern among political figures here. They believe that all the activities of the Committee are related to election affairs, indicating that the election period is not far away. It is generally believed that if Chamberlain believes that the political situation is advantageous to the Conservative Party in October, the election may be held in October. The "People's Newspaper" here declared that after the election, if the Conservative Party can still win a majority, Chamberlain will continue in office for about a month, but Chamberlain must submit his resignation to the King before Christmas, and the successor will be Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon. In addition to this rumor, there have been recent rumors of a possible cabinet reshuffle. According to Sunday's rumors, Chamberlain has planned to reshuffle the cabinet within four weeks, because the recent criticisms of some cabinet members in the newspapers have reduced the credibility of the cabinet, so Chamberlain wants to reshuffle the cabinet, although it is not out of his own will, but because of the pressure of public opinion, he has to do so. It is believed that Secretary of Commerce Stanley, Minister of Health Elliot, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Eastham are all on the list for replacement, and even Sir John Simon may also leave office. As for whether Churchill will join the cabinet, it is still difficult to say for sure. Well-informed sources declare that Churchill may join the cabinet in the near future, as First Lord of the Admiralty. British people believe that his appointment to this important position is most appropriate, and the personnel in the Admiralty are now actively welcoming Churchill to head the department.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister's Speech, Defending Peace, Living in Friendship with All Mankind, US Ambassador Says Cannot Submit</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] French Prime Minister Daladier, speaking today at the dedication ceremony of the monument to the European American Legion at the Neuville Cemetery, expressed France's desire to live in friendship with all mankind. He said that the French people never make false exaggerations, and do not regard themselves as a superior nation that is superior to everything and capable of enslaving other human beings. On the contrary, the greatest happiness for the French is to live equally with all the noblest and most peace-loving nations. Daladier continued, "France never 'sits on the fence.' When it advocates peace, it makes every effort to work for peace with sincerity. Although the current environment is fluctuating and unstable with the discovery of new threats, France has never given up hope of maintaining peace." US Ambassador to France Bullitt followed up by saying, "Whether the American people or the major nations of the West, accepting the horrors of war is lighter than accepting slavery."</p>
<h3>Rumor That US Ambassador to Japan Will Be Replaced, Grew Has Left Office and Returned Home</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Shanghai special dispatch, 29th] According to news transmitted here from Washington, US Ambassador to Japan Grew recently returned to his country on the Japanese Empress liner, and may not return to his post. Japanese newspapers such as "Japan Times" and the military organ newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" have expressed great fear that Grew will not return to his post and unanimously demanded that the US ambassador be able to return to his post as scheduled. Some quarters in Washington believe that Grew is too weak, especially in the "Panay" incident, he failed to take a firm stand, so they hope to replace him with someone stronger and tougher.</p>
<h3>British National Defense Party Members Accept Government White Paper, Discuss Palestine Issue</h3>

<p>Small Commentary</p>
<h3>×Forcibly Conscripting Our Villagers</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out that since the War of Resistance entered its second phase, or the transitional period into a stalemate, the × people have encountered significant difficulties and have adopted a strategy of "politics as the primary focus, with military as support." They attempt to exploit our land, population, and production, that is, to use our country's manpower and material resources to alleviate their current difficulties and increase our difficulties, in preparation for further conquering all of China and dominating the Far East.</p>
<p>According to foreign news from Hong Kong, the Japanese × in Yulin Port have forcibly conscripted 4,000 Chinese laborers, working day and night to expedite the construction of a submarine base, which is largely nearing completion, with the entire project scheduled to be finished within two months. This news further proves a part of the Japanese × new strategy of aggression against China today. This new strategy is being implemented in all occupied areas of China.</p>
<p>Upon seeing such news, one cannot help but feel extremely pained! Especially those of us who have been forced to leave our homeland and native villages by the gunfire of the × people! However, merely feeling heartbroken upon hearing the news is useless! If we still cherish our motherland, our hometowns, and our ancestral graves, fields, homes, and elders, brothers, and sisters, then, though our bodies are in foreign lands, our hearts are with our homeland. Those who still have assets should do their best to help the government develop the work behind the × people's lines and the production and construction in the safe zones. Those who have knowledge and physical strength should intensify efforts to encourage overseas Chinese to invest in and donate to the motherland, and to mobilize overseas Chinese to return to the country and serve their hometowns in an organized and planned manner. In short, we must exert all our strength to go to the occupied areas and behind the × lines to compete with the Japanese × for the people and for political power, to sabotage all Japanese × and traitorous political, economic, and military activities, to launch our establishment of × revolutionary government behind the lines, to launch our × guerrilla warfare behind the lines, and to arrange for the future general counter-offensive to recover lost territories.</p>
<h3>Hull Delivers Speech Severely Condemning Isolationist Policies Advocating International Cooperation and Resolutely Refusing to Submit to Provocative Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chicago, 28th] Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech at the "Starry Night" Club here, criticizing isolationist policies and defending international cooperation. He stated, "We are in turbulent times. Those who revere only violence either invade, or kidnap, seize by force, or take by trickery, all have become commonplace. To reject violence and prevent international relations from being dominated by it is indeed the normal and great path. However, those with power are doing the opposite. Politicians of certain countries have openly declared that they will not hesitate to use force to achieve their goals, without shirking responsibility. The tone of their remarks is so overbearing that threatened nations must either submit unwillingly or arm themselves for self-defense. Such a situation is truly tragic. However, if war does break out, the devastation would be unimaginable. Even as it stands now, countries around the world are suffering immense losses in spirit, energy, and material resources due to their competition to strengthen military preparedness. It is extremely painful to speak of. And in this environment, diplomatic policy must be adapted to the nation's economic development. For problems, whether internal or external, are all interconnected. Now, the United States urgently needs to address these interconnected domestic and foreign policy issues. To claim that someone fails to recognize this connection is a fundamental error. Isolationism arises from this. Those who believe that implementing isolationist policies can make it easier to resolve major domestic issues are not only indulging in fantasy but also potentially inviting great danger. It is essential to know that the consequences of pursuing isolationist policies will be contrary to what these people expect and will not guarantee that our country will not be drawn into the vortex of war. Truly, those who plan to provoke other nations and do not hesitate to wage war to obtain what they covet cannot maintain peace simply by professing peaceful wishes. The only way to maintain empty peace is to endure humiliation and declare submission to provocative nations. Is this what we are willing to do? Stepping back, if our country were to implement isolationist policies, we would inevitably have to change our economic structure. This would not be in our country's interest, and moreover, it would be unhelpful to our country's security for other nations to harbor resentment as a result. From this, it can be seen that the result of implementing isolationist policies would not only fail to reduce our need for defense but would also increase the necessity for it. It is also clear that our country should not live in isolation. On the contrary, only by cooperating with other countries can we find ways to solve our domestic economic problems. As for maintaining peace, there are two concepts: (1) To maintain world order based on international law. So-called order means that the relationships between countries should be based on certain principles of justice and fairness. For our part, if we can respect the independence and sovereignty of other countries, abide by international obligations, and resolve international disputes peacefully, we will undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of world order. (2) Countries should establish sound economic relations. In this regard, the reciprocal trade agreements advocated by the United States serve as a model. The current policy of the U.S. government aims at these two concepts. These two are mutually supportive and inseparable. If one is favored at the expense of the other, the result will not be as desired. Both must be pursued simultaneously to achieve complete success. Since we have this capability, we will certainly devote all our efforts to it."</p>
<p>Isolationist Policies in Flux</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 30th] According to news from Tianjin, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, is currently traveling with his family to Beiping and various parts of North China. He reportedly told reporters that the United States' isolationist policy is indeed in flux. McNutt is quite familiar with the situation in the Far East and plans to return to the U.S. soon to participate in next year's U.S. presidential election campaign. If he were to be elected, U.S. policy toward China would become more proactive.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The U.S. Senate and the Foreign Relations Committee both indicated today that Secretary of State Hull's proposal regarding the revision of the Neutrality Act</p>
<p>has a major impact. Several members of Congress stated that the result of this proposal would be to reintroduce the issue of revising the Neutrality Act in this session of Congress. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate at that time. Senator Byrns stated that Secretary of State's proposal contains many advantages, several of which should be approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Kepper agreed with this statement, saying that he knows for sure that the American Midwest strongly opposes the transportation of scrap iron and war materials to Japan. Senators Nye, Poindexter, Clark, and Borah also</p>
<p>unanimously agree in principle that the United States should not supply war materials to belligerent countries.</p>
<p>Letter Sent to Both Houses of the Foreign Relations Committee</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Hull yesterday sent the same official letter to the chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the Neutrality Act amendment. Political figures have commented that the government's policy has now undergone a significant shift. Secretary of State Hull is scheduled to deliver a speech tonight criticizing isolationist policies to support the official letter. This offensive is largely based on two reasons: (1) In</p>
<p>diplomatic terms, the international situation appears to be quite peaceful on the surface, but the United States should maintain peace in the wisest way, that is, by continuing to closely monitor developments while mobilizing all forces in spirit and material to prevent Germany and Italy from engaging in further acts of aggression or taking unexpected actions. The United States taking this attitude seems to have a positive psychological impact and is actually extremely important. It is generally believed here that the reason why the anti-aggression spirit of European countries has become firmer and why the actions planned by Hitler in early April were delayed or even avoided is that President Roosevelt's telegram of April 15 (addressed separately to Hitler and Mussolini) was not without merit. (2) In</p>
<p>domestic terms, a segment of people is opposing the government regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act. This mentality, although difficult to discern, has strong indications. The Senate and House of Representatives seem to be weary of this case, and time has been wasted without amending it according to the government's wishes. Therefore, the isolationist faction and the anti-government faction seized the opportunity to claim that when the general election is held in 1940, President Roosevelt intends to participate in the election for a third term, but because he has no support on domestic issues, he wants to restore his tarnished reputation in foreign affairs, even at the cost of dragging the United States into the vortex of war. The issue of amending the Neutrality Act has been influenced by this domestic debate and has almost become a case of the tail wagging the dog. To this day, it has become a</p>
<p>force to defeat. Therefore, Secretary of State Hull first issued an official letter, followed by a speech, strongly criticizing the fallacy of isolationist policies. As for the Republican Party, it failed to establish a political program to confront the government during the current session of Congress, and it is also indecisive about future policies. There was once talk of combining with moderate Democratic senators, but this has not materialized. Therefore, although this opposition faction spares no effort in criticizing the government, President Roosevelt's position is now stronger than it was at the beginning of the year. This has been confirmed by Postmaster General Farley after probing opinions within the Democratic Party and among public opinion. Farley said that if President Roosevelt is willing to participate in the election for a third term, the Democratic Party will definitely nominate him as a candidate. This is because people in the State Department firmly believe that President Roosevelt's</p>
<p>foreign policy is still supported by the majority of public opinion, but because the isolationist faction and the opposition faction have colluded and engaged in extensive propaganda, it is difficult to cope with. Secretary of State Hull has taken it as his responsibility to clarify the situation, ensuring that the issue of amending the Neutrality Act is no longer confused by domestic concepts. Some people in the political arena believe that although the government's offensive is somewhat late, it can still encourage public opinion to support it. Others say that the opposition faction in Congress firmly believes that foreign policy is the government's weakness and may continue to obstruct it, so that the issue of amending the Neutrality Act will not be submitted for discussion in the current session of Congress.</p>

<h3>Stalls in the New Central Market Jointly Petition for Rent Reduction Due to Sluggish Business and Unbearable Costs, or They Will Be Forced to Close</h3>
<p>Newspapers have also reported in recent days that meat and vegetable stalls in the New Central Market are facing high rents and limited business, leading some vendors to withdraw. The New Central Market opened on the first of this month and officially began operating on the third. In less than a month, such bad news has emerged, concerning many members of the public. A reporter specifically inquired about the reasons from a butcher in the Central Market, who stated that limited business and high rents were indeed unbearable for the vendors. Secondly, vendors in the Sheung Wan Market, fearing competition after the construction of the Central Market, have largely reduced prices to sell off goods, hoping to avoid being affected. Thirdly, the vegetable stalls are located on the third floor. Although the third floor is not very high, not all customers who come to buy vegetables are young and strong. Those who find it troublesome to climb the stairs will inevitably buy small quantities from the vegetable stalls around Gage Street. Furthermore, since the Central Market was rebuilt, during the construction period of more than ten months, those who purchased meat, fish, and vegetables have been going to the Sheung Wan Market. They are accustomed to the route and familiar with the transactions. Moreover, the prices are relatively cheaper, so many are unwilling to change and prefer to stick to the old ways. Although the vendors in the Central Market want to compete by lowering prices and seeking small profits, the rents are too high (some as high as $180 per month), and meat prices are also high (currently, the purchase price of beef is about $30 per picul, while the retail price is about 32 cents per catty, with limited profit). Additionally, the costs of hiring partners are not small. It is impossible to adhere to the principle of selling more for small profits. All of these are reasons for the poor business performance of vendors in the New Central Market. Therefore, some are now unable to bear the losses and want to stop immediately. Others have abandoned the rented stalls after having paid the deposits, letting their partners take over. Still others are secretly seeking someone to take over the stall, not wanting to be burdened further. More than a dozen have jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Health Bureau, requesting sympathy for their business difficulties and a reduction in rents. However, the Municipal Health Bureau has not yet responded. Currently, there are more vendors who are following suit. In short, if the authorities do not grant their request, it is expected that there will be repeated closures due to poor business.</p>

Chairman Lau Yuk-saap will continue to lead the team. Furthermore, since the start of our country's War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have been enthusiastically donating funds to return to the country. Some have sent letters requesting the association to handle the relief efforts on their behalf and directly remit the funds to the China Relief Association. To this end, the association specifically drafted a memorandum to Committee Member Xu Dai of the China Relief Association, requesting that funds remitted from foreign ports, specifying that the association handle the relief efforts, be approved for allocation. The memorandum can be issued shortly.</p>

<h3>The Bao Hing Steamer Still Dominates Guangdong</h3>
<p>Arrival in Hong Kong Next Week</p>
<p>The cargo ship Bao Hing, which sails on the West River line, has been trapped on the Guangzhou River for more than seven months. After several negotiations, the × side finally agreed to release it. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 36th of this month, along with the Dong An, Da Ming, and Da Li. However, the ship had a lot of cargo, and because the × side did not allow it to be transported to Hong Kong, it was forced to unload in Guangzhou. Therefore, the date of return to Hong Kong was delayed. As of yesterday, it had not yet arrived in Hong Kong. According to the Hong Kong manager of the ship, it is expected to depart on Saturday of this week.</p>
<h3>British Imperial Airways Flight Delayed Arrives Today</h3>

<h3>Austin Road An Eventful Time</h3>
<p>Fire</p>
<p>At 8:10 PM last night, thick smoke suddenly filled the building at No. 23 Austin Road, Yau Ma Tei, with flames shooting out. The people in the building, seeing this, feared that the fire would spread, so they tried to fetch water to extinguish it while sounding the alarm and calling the fire department to send vehicles to assist in the rescue. With the efforts of the team members, the fire was extinguished shortly after. The team members then returned to the station.</p>
<p>False Alarm</p>
<p>At midnight yesterday, the Mong Kok Fire Station received an alarm from a street fire alarm on Austin Road, Yau Ma Tei. The station thought a fire had broken out and immediately dispatched vehicles. However, upon arrival, there was nothing. It turned out that mischievous children had broken the glass of the alarm, falsely reporting a fire.</p>
<h3>The Typhoon is Blowing Southeast Hong Kong is not Affected The Observatory Issues a Report and Lowers the Gale Signal Maritime Traffic Resumes and Conditions are Good</h3>
<p>The weather in Hong Kong has been unpredictable in recent days, with alternating sunshine and rain, brewing a typhoon. The Observatory issued Gale Signal No. 1 as a warning at 10:15 AM on the 28th. At 4:30 PM that afternoon, as the typhoon approached Hong Kong, the Observatory changed the signal to Gale Signal No. 7. The entire Hong Kong Island was under the control of the typhoon, and the situation became even more tense. Fortunately, as the typhoon approached the sea near Hong Kong, it gradually dissipated, causing no damage. The Observatory lowered Gale Signal No. 7 at 10:50 AM yesterday morning. The tense situation on land and sea was lifted, and normalcy was restored.</p>
<p>Typhoon Movement</p>
<p>According to the Observatory's report, the movement of the typhoon was as follows: At 9:45 AM on the 28th, the typhoon was detected within 60 miles of 19 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude. The progress was quite slow. At 10:15 AM, Gale Signal No. 1 was raised. An anti-cyclone blew eastward in the Pacific, southeast of Japan. The typhoon was 200 miles southeast of Hong Kong, blowing northward slowly. At 3:15 PM, the typhoon had blown to between 20 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude, blowing northeastward. At 5:00 PM, it blew to 21 degrees North latitude and 115 degrees East longitude. At 5:45 PM, a mild anti-cyclone blew from the three northeastern provinces towards the Pacific, extending to the east of the Sea of Japan. Also, at 2:00 PM, the typhoon was 120 miles southeast of Hong Kong and threatened to hit Hong Kong. At 11:00 PM, the air pressure continued to gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Gale Signal Lowered</p>
<p>The Observatory issued another report yesterday morning, stating that from 1:00 PM yesterday to 6:00 AM today (29th), the typhoon remained between Shek Kok and Waglan Island, blowing northeastward. Its direction of movement was still towards Hong Kong, but the force of the wind had gradually weakened and was no longer a threat. Until 10:15 AM yesterday morning, the Gale Signal No. 7 raised by the Meteorological Office had been lowered. After the Gale Signal was lowered, the Observatory issued another report, stating that the typhoon was blowing southeastward, 100 miles from Hong Kong, but had turned mild and the wind force was stable. The weather in Hong Kong was blowing northeasterly, the temperature was 79 degrees, the humidity was 85 degrees, and the rainfall on the 28th was 3.5%. The total rainfall this year is 38.61 inches.</p>
<p>Restoration of Normalcy</p>
<p>Regarding the situation on land and sea in Hong Kong, since the Observatory changed the signal to Gale Signal No. 7, the situation on the sea suddenly became tense, and the waves gradually became turbulent. Ships and boats in the port rushed to the typhoon shelter to take refuge. The naval patrol boats were also ordered to patrol. After 6:00 PM, the sea was empty of small boats and ships, and the larger ships had also prepared to set fire to open the typhoon shelter. Each side of the sea presented a desolate scene. The situation on land was also quite tense. Shops in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon were preparing for the typhoon to strike, and the doors and signs of many shops were tightly secured. Shops and residents in coastal and low-lying areas set up floodgates in front of their doors to prepare for any eventuality. The tense situation was reminiscent of the tragic scene of the "92" typhoon. However, after the gale signal was lowered yesterday morning, the situation on land and sea completely eased, and maritime traffic returned to normal.</p>
<p>Postal Ship Encountered Typhoon</p>
<p>Fortunately, the typhoon did not cause a disaster in Hong Kong, and there were no major losses on land and sea. Among the ships at sea that encountered the typhoon were the Lanput Tanner of the Iron Line Mail Ship Company, and the President Coolidge and Maosheng Victoria of the American Mail Ship Company. What about the details of the last two ships Hong Kong has not received a report, according to Lanput Tanner's telegram to Hong Kong, when the typhoon occurred, the ship's route coincided with the wind's time when the typhoon had blown to 9 degrees, 5 East longitude 114 degrees, the ship was east of the wind direction, 60 miles from the center of the typhoon, the typhoon blew southwest to the west, and the wind force was 40 miles per hour, as for Coolidge, when the typhoon blew to 20 degrees 5 North latitude and 114 degrees 5 east, the ship was 50 miles from the center of the typhoon, encountering the wind force, Lanput Tanner was more violent, the ship telegram Hong Kong said, the wind blew southeast to the east, and the wind force was 60 miles per hour.</p>
<p>House Collapsed and Injured People</p>
<p>On land, no serious accidents have occurred after the wind and rain. Only a terrace in Wan Chai was blown down by the wind, injuring one person. The incident occurred on the roof of No. 375 Lockhart Road. At 11:20 AM yesterday, it suddenly collapsed due to days of wind and rain erosion. Hearing a loud noise, nearby residents knew that an accident had occurred and immediately called the police station to report it. After receiving the report, the fire department immediately dispatched vehicles to the scene to provide assistance. As a result, a porter was injured and sent to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. The collapsed terrace was an old-fashioned building made of wooden frames and tiles, which was a warehouse for a certain company. When it collapsed, several porters were carrying timber here. Fortunately, they escaped quickly and were not injured. Only one porter was slightly injured on the head by bricks and tiles.</p>
<p>Horse Race Rescheduled</p>
<p>The fifth special horse race of the Hong Kong Jockey Club was originally scheduled to continue for one day yesterday. However, as of 10:00 AM yesterday morning, because the gale signal had not yet been lowered and it was raining heavily, it was announced that the horse race on that day would be cancelled and it was decided to hold a makeup race on Saturday, June 3rd.</p>
<h3>The Tourist Guide Agency Guides But Does Not Tour: Police Station Conducts Thorough Investigation; 500 Agencies Operate Throughout Hong Kong, Employing Thousands: The Practice of "Selling Dog Meat Under a Sheep's Head" Must Be Stopped Immediately</h3>
<p>In the past two months, tourist guide agencies have sprung up in Hong Kong like bamboo shoots after rain. As of now, statistics show that there are over 500 tourist guide agencies in Hong Kong, employing up to a thousand tourist guides. Among them, the quality is mixed, and many engage in activities that disrupt public morals under the guise of tourist guiding, going beyond normal boundaries. The government authorities have long been aware of this situation and have been taking measures to crack down on it. However, due to the laws of Hong Kong and China, there are no explicit provisions prohibiting tourist guide agencies, so a complete ban cannot be immediately imposed. Nevertheless, the authorities consider public morals to be of utmost importance and will strictly crack down on those who overstep the line. According to reliable sources, the authorities have authorized the police to investigate all Hong Kong and Chinese tourist guide agencies at any time. If any tourist guide agency or tourist guide engages in activities that deviate from the proper path and violate the laws maintaining public morals, they can exercise their authority to arrest them and charge them with offenses against public decency, thereby preventing cunning individuals from engaging in illicit activities under the guise of tourist guiding. It is rumored that several tourist guide agencies in certain areas of Central are employing a "selling dog meat under a sheep's head" policy, where the facilities are specialized and have absolutely nothing to do with the tourist guide business. For example, a building is divided into several rooms, each with a bed. When customers visit the agency, they each occupy a room and freely choose a prostitute to engage in lewd behavior inside the room. This is what is called "indoor tourism," which is actually no different from a private brothel. The police have been closely monitoring these types of tourist guide agencies. Yesterday (the 28th), police detectives were dispatched to search a certain tourist guide agency in Central, but the results are unknown.</p>
<h3>City Tigers Collide</h3>
<p>Two Children Narrowly Sacrificed</p>
<p>Various car accidents causing injuries occurred in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories yesterday morning. Taxi number 777 departed from Tai Po for Kowloon at 4 a.m. When it reached Sha Tin Tai Tu Village, a private car of an unknown number suddenly chased after it, overtook the taxi, and sped ahead, knocking down two children by the roadside. After the accident, both vehicles stopped. The children were carried into the cars, intending to be taken to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, when the private car reversed, it crashed into the front of the taxi, damaging the vehicle and the fender, and then stopped again. At this time, the two children got out of the car and fled. Afterward, the taxi driver, Kwok Fung-keung, went to the police station to report the incident.</p>
<h3>The Lu-Wu Marriage</h3>
<p>Miss Wu Liyu, the third daughter of Mr. Wu Chaoshu, and Mr. Lu Ronggan held their wedding ceremony at St. John's Cathedral at 3 p.m. yesterday, officiated by Bishop Mow Shou-tseng and Reverend Li Qiu-en. A tea party was held at the Gloucester Hotel at 4:30 p.m., with hundreds of dignitaries from all walks of life attending to offer congratulations, including Soong Ching-ling, Soong Tzu-wen, Wu Tiecheng, Chow Shou-chen, Hu Mulan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and He Xiangning. The event was grand and unprecedented.</p>
<h3>YMCA Launches "Friends of Soldiers" Campaign: Expand Organization, Increase Service Personnel: Hope Everyone Does Their Duty as a Friend to Soldiers</h3>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, the national youth have been providing services to soldiers with remarkable results. Various services, such as consolation and reception, wound treatment and rescue, training and education, and recreation and entertainment, have been commended by military officers and welcomed by soldiers and civilians alike. In 1938 alone, no fewer than four million soldiers were served, and the service areas were spread across various war zones throughout the country. This work is a manifestation of military-civilian cooperation and represents the love and enthusiasm of the people in the rear for the soldiers at the front. Now that the war zone is expanding and the service work is becoming more urgent, the Soldiers Service Committee of the National YMCA has decided to expand its organization and increase service personnel to meet the current needs. It will also jointly organize the Soldiers Service Committee of the National YMCA, Guangdong and Hong Kong Branch with the Guangdong and Hong Kong YMCA Military Service Committee to strengthen its forces. The Hong Kong YMCA is responding to this matter by launching a major "Friends of Soldiers" campaign. A meeting of leaders of various small groups of the YMCA will be convened at 7:30 p.m. on June 6 at the YMCA Library on Bridges Street to discuss the implementation plan. This initiative is of great significance because soldiers sacrifice themselves for the country and their hard work is commendable. Being a friend to them is a great honor. If everyone joins as a friend of the soldiers and does their duty as a friend, deeply expressing the enthusiasm of the people in the rear, the soldiers at the front will be greatly consoled and will greatly enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. This initiative of the YMCA not only enhances the relationship between the people and the soldiers but also contributes to the future of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>The YWCA of Guangzhou will hold a reunion conference for members staying in Hong Kong tomorrow at the YMCA hall in Kowloon; all members and friends are welcome</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou YWCA has now moved to Hong Kong and Macao to carry out fundraising work. The Hong Kong office is located in the YMCA on Waterloo Road in Kowloon, and the Macao office is located on the second floor of No. 1, Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro in Macao. A members' reunion conference will be held at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 31, in the YMCA Hall on Waterloo Road, Kowloon. All those who have joined the Guangzhou YWCA and their relatives and friends are welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>The Kuala Lumpur Return-to-China Service Corps Arrives in Hong Kong: The 73-member group, led by Zhong Chun-sheng, will make preparations in Hong Kong before departing for Dongjiang</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have been concerned about their motherland, contributing money and organizing return-to-China service corps. Many patriotic overseas Chinese are willing to abandon their businesses and overcome difficulties to return to China to serve. Their spirit of loving their motherland is admirable. Recently, another compatriots' service corps organized by overseas Chinese in Kuala Lumpur has returned to China. The 73-member group arrived in Hong Kong on the "Fengqing" ship at around 10 a.m. yesterday and stayed in a hotel in Kowloon. They will transfer to the mainland to serve soon. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed a member of the corps and inquired about the destination of this return to China to serve and the situation of the overseas Chinese in the local national salvation movement. According to the reply, this time, the 73-member corps is led by Zhong Chun-sheng, and the staff includes Chief Executive Huang Yifang, Office Director Ye Jusheng, Finance Director Luo Yifan, Propaganda Director Ye Fusheng, Liaison Director Wen Dansheng, and 67 members, all of whom are male. The members all have specialized skills in first aid, mechanics, medicine, etc. Because most of the members are from Guangdong, the destination of the service will be Boluo, Huiyang, and Bao'an in Dongjiang, so as to achieve greater efficiency. The overseas Chinese in Kuala Lumpur are very enthusiastic about the national salvation work. The establishment of national salvation groups is like a storm. Under the leadership of the China Relief Association for Overseas Chinese, the local overseas Chinese are all patriotic, so the work is progressing smoothly. The amount of donations is the highest in Southeast Asia. After arriving in Hong Kong, our group will stay for a while to make preparations and then depart. The departure date has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>What Ways Should Be Used to Win Over the Hong Kong Reading Public? A Record of the "Literary Association" Symposium</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Dishan suggests: Training storytellers</p>
<p>"Hong Kong literary workers, organize!"</p>
<p>"Give play to the great role of raising the bar!"</p>
<p>"Strengthen the cultural counterattack!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The demands of the objective environment were so pressing, and the appeals from all sides were so enthusiastic; therefore, on the anniversary of the National Literary Association—March 27—the cultural figures of Hong Kong finally organized themselves. The name is the Correspondence Office of the Hong Kong Members of the National Literary and Art Circles Resistance Association. The abbreviation is "Literary Association." Since its establishment, in addition to publishing weekly supplements in rotation in the "Ta Kung Pao," "Zhujiang," "Shen Bao," and "Sing Tao Daily" newspapers, the "Literary Association" has also been divided into four groups: "Magazine Literature," "Western Culture," "Art Literature," and "Film and Drama Literature." Symposiums are held in order each week. Spiritual unity and work performance are much improved compared to the previous state of "fighting on their own."</p>
<p>For the sake of concentrated research, the symposiums of the four groups have recently been unified. The first joint symposium of the groups was successfully held the other day.</p>
<p>The address was at the Youth Journalists Association. Although many were unable to attend due to being busy with work, there were still many who attended enthusiastically. Those who expressed their opinions included: Xu Dishan, Lu Danlin, Wu Jingsong, Fang Yu, Pan Lang, Wang Jianming, Peng Chenghui, Guo Butao, Mai Sui, Cai Lei, Du Wenhui, Chen Latt, and Zhu Qizhuo. The central topic of the symposium was: "What ways should be used to win over the Hong Kong reading public." The motivation was, needless to say, aimed at the serious problem that many Hong Kong readers spend their time and energy on "poisonous publications" and "low-level tastes."</p>
<p>The discussion was very enthusiastic, and the materials contributed were also very rich. For detailed information, please see the next issue of "Literary Association." Due to space limitations, only the highlights of the important conclusions can be introduced here:</p>
<p>The ways to win over the Hong Kong reading public should be:</p>
<p>1. Strive to make the writing popular so that everyone can understand it;</p>
<p>2. Select topics that are closely related to the readers or topics that readers like, and handle them correctly;</p>
<p>3. Make full use of old forms and promote new ideas, but do not be slaves to old forms;</p>
<p>4. Start by mobilizing teachers and middle school students to love new literary works;</p>
<p>5. Arouse readers' interest from entertainment and sports, and change their wrong concepts;</p>
<p>6. Do not passively cater to low-level tastes, but actively guide and improve cultural standards;</p>
<p>7. The news writing style of newspapers should be improved, and attention should be paid to punctuation;</p>
<p>8. Stand on the position of small newspapers, create works with new content in old forms, win over small newspaper readers, and carry out a long-term struggle with decadent and poisonous works;</p>
<p>9. Expand the promotion of the Latinized New Writing Movement, because the literate reading public is only a small part of the vast masses. To accelerate the popularization of education, improve the level, and instill new consciousness, one should start with new writing;</p>
<p>10. Improve comic strips.</p>
<p>11. ...</p>
<p>Among these, the most interesting, concrete, and meaningful was the opinion provided by Mr. Xu Dishan. Mr. Xu said that he often carefully observed in the storytelling stalls in the Sai Ying Pun area. Many people who listen to storytellers also like to listen to materials such as the passing of the Volunteer Army's resistance against Japan and interesting current affairs news. Many storytellers are now not talking about the chivalrous set, but rather randomly talking about new books such as "Japanese Spies" and "Journey to the West," and he has the ability to tell them very pleasantly. Because of this new trend, Mr. Xu suggested organizing and training storytellers, the blind, those who sell olives, and those who sell medicines, giving them new content, and hiring them to distribute and preach in various central areas. The effect must be very grand. Everyone expressed agreement with Mr. Xu's opinion and added opinions one after another. As a result, it was decided to hand it over to the council to handle in conjunction with the Youth Journalists Association. We hope that the responsible authorities of the "Literary Association" and the "Youth Journalists Association" will launch it as soon as possible and take on this great task.</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided that the central issue of the next symposium would be "What should be written specifically in Hong Kong?" The time has been changed to 6 p.m. on Friday, and the location is still at the Youth Journalists Association. It is hoped that the members of the Literary Association will attend and participate on time in the future.</p>
<h3>Japan's Impertinent Behavior</h3>
<p>— South China Morning Post Commentary</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong South China Morning Post published a commentary entitled "Japan's Impertinent Behavior," denouncing the illegality of Japanese warships intercepting foreign ships, exposing the insidious nature of Japan's actions, and stating that Japan's domestic economic situation is deteriorating further and that victory is hopeless, and that Japan is at a loss as to what to do. The original text is translated as follows: The Japanese explanation for intercepting foreign ships is chilling if the malice contained in their interception is concealed. According to a Japanese spokesman, the interception of the Tieling shipping vessel "Lanpura" was purely a routine matter to verify its nationality. However, the "Lanpura" is a well-known ship, and any warship captain would have no doubt about its nationality. It has always been a British ship, and the British flag is clearly visible. The argument held by the French mail ship "Aramis" is the same. Regarding the "Lanpura" incident, the Japanese action was obviously an unreasonable and arbitrary act. However, it is not yet known whether this action was taken by the Japanese authorities, the commander-in-chief of the navy, or the captain of the Japanese warship. But in fact, the "Lanpura" was about one mile away from Hong Kong's territorial waters and was about to enter Hong Kong, so what reason did it have to encounter such a well-planned and provocative incident? Its intention is still mysterious. The "Lanpura" and "Aramis" incidents coincide with the development of other incidents that caused riots, such as Japan's declaration of a blockade of the entire Chinese coastline, two hundred miles offshore. But Japan still conceals the key points. Japan's attempt to seize the concessions of various countries in China is also one of them. And Europe's situation regarding Japan, and the deterioration of its domestic economic situation, are also among them. The last item above may explain everything. Japan's hope of winning has been dashed, and it is at a loss as to what to do. All these facts are interconnected. Now Germany and Italy need to be cautious in their actions, or it is now Japan's turn to cause trouble, and what happens to the public concessions and concessions, in order to make it have the opportunity to achieve its goals, and try to use it to oppress the powers to stop aiding China. Regarding the Gulangyu incident, although it insisted on its conditions, before the landing of British, American, and French troops, Japan withdrew most of the troops that had landed. Japan undoubtedly believes that this damages its dignity. It is not surprising that the Japanese navy is trying to regain face. As for the political situation in which Japan is now, it must make a final choice, a democratic country or a totalitarian country, but its position in China and its counter-behavior with the Soviet Union make its choice difficult. At this stage, Japan is clearly destroying the British-Soviet alliance and promoting its position against Britain. The interception of foreign ships is also a natural result of the weak attitude of the powers at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. Japan announced the implementation of the blockade, and at the same time claimed that Japan's actions "are in accordance with the announcements of August and September 1937, which were accepted by the powers." From this point of view, it is urgent to deny that Japan has the right to blockade, and that the powers have recognized the facts. Moreover, the recent announcements issued by Japan were not issued by the Japanese government, but by the "Deputy Commissioner of Customs" of the Japanese Shanghai, followed by the spokesman of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai. He has no formal official qualifications. As the Japanese authorities said, without war, there is no right of belligerent countries, even if China's coast is blockaded, it must notify all parties with legal procedures, and implement it effectively, not allowing any ships to pass through, but Hong Kong cannot be included in it. What the powers have recognized is only that the Japanese are allowed to check the nationality of ships only when they have reason to suspect the nationality of the ship. This recognition is limited. The powers' tolerance of their arbitrariness is to avoid friction with Japan. The powers cannot give up their rights to Japan's illegal acts again. Except for the United States, the powers are not prepared to arm and escort their own ships, and the fact that American ships have not been harassed is noteworthy. In any case, if the powers retaliate against Japan, they should first detain a Japanese ship to await the release of the "Shajilishi" ship.</p>

<h3>With Each Victory, the War Becomes More Optimistic: Our Strike Force Fiercely Attacks Shengang, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy: Loyal and Brave Air Force Launches Attacks, Bombarding Enemy Military Supplies</h3>
<p>(Urgent Report from Wengyuan) In the Zengcheng-Conghua battle, we have consistently maintained the initiative, making steady progress, and the battle results have become increasingly clear. The enemy is still trying to struggle, constantly harassing Luofu Mountain, Fuhe, and other places in Boluo to contain our army's offensive. However, each time they are dealt a severe blow and cannot succeed. Recently, our army has made rapid progress, and our brave air force has also launched attacks. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Attack on Conghua: Fierce Battles</p>
<p>On the Conghua front, the enemy in Shengang and Taipingchang have repeatedly crossed the river to conduct reconnaissance in force against our positions in Mayazhuang. They have also dispatched troops from Guizui to create a false impression. However, our army is well aware of the enemy's plan and firmly defends its positions, never wavering. On the morning of the 27th, a unit of the strike force of the Peng Division of our 12th Army Corps attacked the enemy in Shengang along the Guangcong Highway. A fierce encounter battle occurred with over 400 enemy infantry and cavalry at the North Dagang Ridge in Shengang. After three hours of fighting, over 50 enemy infantrymen, over 20 cavalrymen, and over 10 warhorses were annihilated. The enemy's morale was greatly weakened. The enemy army in Shengang urgently mobilized over 200 infantrymen and several tanks to reinforce them. However, the enemy was already routed, and their reinforcements quickly covered and collected the remnants of Dagang Ridge and retreated towards Shengang, holding firm and not going out. About 200 enemy infantry and cavalry crossed the river from Luogang Market and carried out a large-scale harassment in the area near Kapok. A unit of our Peng Division, upon receiving a report from a sentry, immediately dispatched a team to encircle and annihilate them, killing dozens of enemies. The remaining enemy soldiers retreated in panic towards Shengang. Now, we have established close contact with the strike force from Jiekou and the local guerrillas and have surrounded the enemy in Shengang and Taipingchang in an arc.</p>
<p>Our Army Once Rushed into Zhucun</p>
<p>On the Zengcheng front, because the enemy's flanks and rear were attacked and the transportation line on the Guangzeng Highway was in imminent danger of being cut off by us at any time, they sent troops to defend it tightly and strengthened fortifications in the suburbs. Our army attacked the enemy unexpectedly in Fule and He at night on the 26th and partly attacked Danqiu from the flank, causing the enemy to be unable to take care of both ends. According to the enemy in the two places, they were suddenly attacked and lost contact. They urgently telegraphed Zengcheng for reinforcements. Unexpectedly, our brave soldiers took advantage of the enemy's weakness and fiercely charged into the enemy's position, destroying a part of the enemy's fortifications. Our Luo unit's guerrilla team also mobilized to help in the battle and once rushed into Zhucun, killing 60-70 enemies and capturing two machine guns and over 30 rifles. By the time the enemy reinforcements arrived, our team had completed its mission and safely returned to its original defense.</p>
<p>Our Air Force Achieved Success on the Front Line</p>
<p>According to military news from the front line in Dongjiang, our aircraft have been extremely active in the past ten days, repeatedly launching reconnaissance attacks on enemy positions. On the afternoon of the 24th, at about 1:00 p.m., a team of our brave air force took off from a certain place and launched an air raid on the enemy army in Zengcheng. They soared and observed over the Guangzeng Highway. Over a dozen enemy military vehicles loaded with military supplies were seen driving from Guangzhou to the east, and when they reached the vicinity of Beikeng in Zhongxin, our aircraft immediately descended from high altitude with agile maneuvers and continuously dropped multiple heavy bombs, all hitting the target. Over 20 enemy military vehicles were destroyed, killing over a dozen enemies. The enemy lost a large number of military supplies. After dropping the bombs, our aircraft flew to Shilong in Zengcheng for reconnaissance and returned safely to the defense after completing the mission.</p>
<p>Zengcheng Exortion of Grain and Fuel</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy army in Dongjiang has recently been suffering from the "blockade policy" of the Dongguan-Huizhou area, and there is an extreme shortage of grain and fuel. According to intelligence from the Third District Guerrilla Column, the enemy in Zengcheng has been searching the villages for days and has ordered the puppet county magistrate Liu to force each village to supply grain and fuel daily, and stipulates that larger villages should be levied five dan of rice and two cans of kerosene per day, and smaller villages should pay three dan of rice and one can of kerosene. A deadline of five days was given to pay the money to the puppet association for counting. Those who violated it would be punished as bandits and burned and killed. The villagers in the area along the front line of Boluo-Zengcheng at the foot of Luofu Mountain are living in dire straits under the enemy's harsh levies and have fled to Longmen and Boluo. Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the Third District Column, has ordered the front-line troops to take strict precautions and devise methods to cut off the enemy army's supply.</p>
<p>The Enemy Army in Shilong Harasses the Villages for Days</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy army in Dongguan-Longchuan on the south bank of the Dongjiang has also repeatedly dispatched small groups to harass the villages in recent days. On the 26th, the enemy in Shilong sent dozens of soldiers to harass Nanshe, Xihu, and Jingshan villages and looted grain. On the 27th, they sent 300-400 infantry and cavalrymen to Shiwancailan and forced Dongbo and Tiechang in Boluo to pay 300 yuan in military pay and over ten bags of rice. Under the enemy's coercion, the villagers were forced to supply the required amount. In addition, the villages along the Dongjiang River, such as Shangxianhe, Laoliao, Fulong, Yanwo, and Shipai, have recently received threats from the enemy puppet and were forced to take over the order from the Shilong puppet maintenance association. The villagers are now gathering to discuss how to deal with it.</p>

<h3>Stability in the Jianghui Battle; Our Mechanized Units Launch a Two-Pronged Counteroffensive; Sanbu Stabilized, Market Gradually Recovering Prosperity; People from Five Counties Commemorate the Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Express News from Zhongshan] According to military dispatches, the Jianghui × army has suffered repeated setbacks and its strength has been depleted. At present, it can only hold its defensive positions and has no strength to launch further offensives. Our army continues to advance along the Xin'kai and Xin'he routes. Our mechanized units launched from the Jianghe Road on the 27th to assist frontline troops in attacking Jiangmen. On the morning of the 28th, large numbers of our tanks were spotted operating on the Jianghe Road. Our engineering corps also rushed to repair the damaged roads to facilitate the advance of our mechanized units. As a result, morale was greatly boosted, and there is confidence in the counteroffensive against Jianghui.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Jianghui</p>
<p>According to intelligence received yesterday from the Jianghui area by the local military authorities: [1] In Jiangmen, × forces are forcibly conscripting civilians, killing those who resist, and issuing large amounts of military scrip, forcing them to circulate in the market to collect our national currency and silver. Currently, all the silver and paper money of the residents of temples and households in the city have been looted. [2] Our guerrillas raided the city of Hui overnight, causing great panic among the × forces stationed there. Barbed wire has now been installed at each street entrance to prevent our forces from entering. [3] About ten or more × speedboats near the Basha Dyke Bridge suddenly sailed away on the morning of the 28th, their destination unknown. [4] Jiang Zhongyun, the village head of Wenxiang, Kaiping, was detained by Yang's regiment for failing to sabotage the highway effectively. [5] Our newly formed mechanized unit arrived at a certain location on the Jianghe Road on the morning of the 28th to assist our Dalang unit in attacking.</p>
<p>Recovery of Prosperity in Sanbu It has been observed that since our troops launched a counteroffensive recently, the Jianghui battle has become more stable in Xinchang, Dihai, Changsha and Sanbu. The public has gradually returned to their shops and businesses, and prosperity is gradually returning. In terms of transportation, all ferries are operating smoothly, and goods are flowing in steadily. The prices of grains in Sanbu are as follows: high-quality Simiao rice, 14.8 yuan per bag; medium rice, 13.6 yuan per bag; coarse rice, 11.1 yuan per bag; raw oil, 19 yuan per "shou"; kerosene, 12 yuan; live pigs, about 50 yuan per "zu"; pickled mustard greens, 10 yuan per "dan"; and loose pine firewood, 1.9 yuan per "zu." The First District Security Command of Wendi held a memorial service in Taicheng on the 27th for the fallen soldiers in the Jianghui battle. Representatives from all sectors of the people of the Five Counties and various organizations attended, and Commander Gu Dinghua presided over the ceremony. The ceremony was exceptionally solemn and magnificent.</p>
<h3>The × Army on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Line; Frequent Transportation, Showing Signs of Unrest; Tight Security in Luba; Unable to Cross Stealthily; × Speedboats Reconnoitering Constantly; One Sunk</h3>
<p>[Express News from Xijiang] The × army on the Sanshui front line of Xijiang has recently increased in number. Transportation along the Guangzhou-Sanshui line is frequent, mostly for the transport of food supplies. There is no change in the frontline × army, but the × army still harbors ambitions to invade the west and is actively preparing for unrest.</p>
<p>The × Army in Sanshui Is Massively Assembling Fir Rafts</p>
<p>Recently, the × forces on the Sanshui front line have repeatedly collected fir wood from various villages and stored it in warehouses in Hekou, totaling several thousand logs. On the 20th, several military vehicles of the × army from Foshan, fully loaded with ropes, bamboo mats, and iron bars, were transported to various places such as Hekou, Southwest Ganggen, and Makou. The next day (21st), they began to conscript laborers from nearby villages to build fir rafts and wooden rafts for them. At present, there are many × army wooden rafts gathered on the river surface of Xinlu, Jiaokou, and Laoyazhou, indicating a malicious intention. According to military intelligence, the × forces in Sanshui are eager to annex Luba, an important town that controls the throat of the North River, in order to remove the threat from their flank. For the past month, × aircraft have frequently arrived in the town for reconnaissance and bombing. In addition to strengthening the defense strength of the line, the Xijiang military authorities have also ordered the tax police corps and a certain division's commando team along the Luba West Road to guard it closely, preventing the × forces from entering stealthily.</p>
<p>× Speedboats Patrolling, One Sunk by Our Forces</p>
<p>In addition, about thirty or forty × speedboats and electric boats have been sailing to the sea area around Hekou and Xinxu in recent days, and have been actively patrolling around Zhuokou, Ganggen, Xinxu, and Fuchuangang, and have sent boats from time to time to patrol and spy along the coast of Qingqi, Jiusan, and Mujiaowei. On the morning of the 26th, several × electric boats sailed along the North River to the Wanjinsha River and patrolled, frequently using binoculars to observe our Chendi. Our artillery at Mafang observed the situation, knowing it was × reconnaissance in nature, and calmly defended. When the × forces reached a favorable terrain, they took advantage of the × forces' unpreparedness and bombarded the × forces fiercely, firing seven or eight rounds. One of the leading × electric boats was the first to be hit and sunk, and two others were damaged in the tail. The × forces fled in panic and scurried downwards. More than twenty × soldiers fell into the water and drowned. After this setback, although the × speedboats still patrolled everywhere on the 27th, they did not dare to approach our positions to spy on them.</p>
<h3>× Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombed; Shantou British Community Planning Coping Measures; Our Authorities Working Hard to Prevent × Massacre Policy; Actively Evacuating Population and Instilling Air Defense Knowledge</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shantou] Due to the indiscriminate bombing by × aircraft, residential and commercial areas and other prosperous areas in Shantou are filled with ruins and devastation. Currently, boat and car companies have generally switched to night shifts, and markets have switched to night markets. Starting from the 26th, the forced emigration of the elderly, weak, women, and children has further silenced the city. Last night, the British community in the city held a meeting at the British Consulate to discuss how to ensure their own safety and maintain and develop their businesses in the face of the urgent × threat to Chaoshan and the insane bombing by × aircraft. Several principles were determined and the meeting adjourned after 11:00 p.m. It was heard that the decision was made to emphasize to the × that British interests in Chaoshan could not be abandoned or destroyed, and to ask the British government to express its determination to protect those interests and make appropriate preparations to cope with the situation. The military authorities have taken practical measures to prevent the × people from carrying out a massacre policy. (1) Evacuation: Starting from the 26th, military police will go to each car and boat dock to check the entry of passengers each time the cars and boats arrive. Men and women who meet the evacuation standards will be registered and allowed to stay in the city for no more than five days. Violators will be arrested by the police and deported, and will never be allowed to return to the city. If men and women who should be evacuated are found in the city, they will be escorted by police to the branch bureau for disposal. At the same time, a census will be conducted to severely punish those who neglect their duties. Those who are poor and have no means to escape can apply for an evacuation certificate and receive a free boat and car certificate and expenses from the Women and Children Care Association (3 cents for adults and 2 cents for children). More than 1,000 people received certificates on the 25th night. It is estimated that the city's population will be reduced to 50,000 by the end of this month. (2) Propaganda: In order to provide the public with knowledge of air defense to reduce losses, the authorities published the proportion of air raid disasters in Qujiang and Shantou in the past, proving that the public should not be afraid of the ×'s crazy bombing, but of the public's lack of air defense knowledge. A. Qujiang was air-raided 60 times from August 31, 1937 to the end of April 1939, with 569 aircraft and 1,021 bombs, resulting in 283 deaths, 676 injuries, 770 stores destroyed, and 74 boats bombed. However, in the early stages, people did not seek shelter when they heard the alarm, and 27 bombs caused 751 casualties in five bombings. Later, with richer air defense knowledge, 994 bombs caused 208 casualties in 54 air raids. In the former case, each bomb caused 28 casualties, while in the latter case, each five bombs caused only one casualty. B. In Shantou, more than 60 bombs fell on the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th of this month, causing more than 150 casualties. After the authorities evacuated the population and provided air defense knowledge, more than 40 bombs on the 14th, 15th, 17th and 23rd caused only about 50 casualties.</p>
<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3>The Dark Side of Hollywood; Especially Many Beggars; Actresses Selling Their Bodies</h3>
<p>Hollywood, the capital of the film industry, has cast an unparalleled fantasy in the minds of every moviegoer, making people who have never been to the film capital believe that it is always a city of gold, that there is only glory and no sorrow, only wealth and no poverty, so they are fascinated and admire it endlessly. In fact, Hollywood is just like other cities in the world. How can it be as perfect as you imagine?</p>
<p>In Hollywood, except for a few stars, the lives of actors are very plain and hard. A salary of thirty to forty yuan a week is considered very lucky. These actors usually have contracts with film companies for ten to fifteen weeks. If there are no amazing achievements, after the contract expires, they can rarely continue to get a contract in the original company. The remuneration for extras is higher. Usually it is eight to ten yuan per day. Although this number seems small, it is very fortunate to be hired for three days a week. In addition to registering with the central introduction office, extras have to wander around the various companies every day waiting for the opportunity, because the need for extras in the shooting site is sometimes decided temporarily, so everyone is exploring and searching, for fear of missing the opportunity.</p>
<p>There is almost no difference between ordinary actors and extras. Ordinary actors become extras after the contract expires. As long as an extra gets a contract, they immediately become an ordinary actor. Their living conditions are also roughly similar. Of course, they do not have the power to build houses on Beverly Hills. Those apartments about ten miles outside Hollywood are the dormitories of these "future stars." Their economic strength usually only allows them to live in a small room of about one hundred square feet with only one window, with a daily rent of one yuan to one and a half yuan. They take the streetcar or even walk to Hollywood every day, and patronize the small cafes near various parks and shooting sites for three meals a day. Some bring their own cheap sandwiches and sit on the park benches to enjoy themselves. But if they cannot find a job for three or five days, even this hard life will become difficult.</p>
<p>According to statistics at the end of June this year, there were more than 124,000 ordinary actors and extras in Hollywood. The average number of actors needed by each company every day is 20,000 to 25,000, which means that each person can find a job for one day every four or five days on average. Among these actors, men account for 40% and women account for 60%. Although many actors feel unstable in their lives and have changed careers one after another, those who arrive later still come in droves, maintaining the above numbers for a long time.</p>
<p>Another thing that is enough to surprise people is the number of beggars in Hollywood. There are beggars constantly wandering in front of the gates of various shooting sites, waiting for the alms of big stars and wealthy visitors. It is not uncommon to give one yuan at a time, so the income of several beggars is even more abundant than that of the actors. They enter and exit small restaurants and sit at the same table with future stars. The only thing they use to show their identity is that they have to wear clothes that are a little more ragged.</p>
<p>Some of the extra actresses have to engage in side jobs because they cannot maintain their lives. There are many kinds of side jobs, and the most miserable one is of course the sale of their bodies. Their customers are shooting site staff and foreign tourists. The price is similar to filming. As long as you can pay more than ten yuan, you can enjoy a whole night. There is a popular saying in Hollywood: "One day job, one night job, a week's food and accommodation." It is really cruel to the extreme.</p>

<h3>Strange Things Needed for Filming; Hollywood's Strangest Occupations; Collecting Stamps; Collecting Ancient Coins; Collecting Buttons</h3>
<p>Because Hollywood directors often need strange things for filming, many experts have been created, and there are strange occupations in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Some people who collect stamps provide rare stamps to film companies to display them on the screen. There is also a person who collects coins and relies on collecting ancient coins to supply the needs of filmmakers to maintain a living.</p>
<p>Lower 50,000 Buttons</p>
<p>The strangest thing is a button collecting expert. He earns a lot of money every year for buttons. He was originally a tailor for a film company. When it was discovered that strange buttons were needed for filming, he began to do this collecting business. Now he has more than 150,000 buttons in his collection, including the ancient buttons used by Napoleon's guards in the beginning.</p>
<p>All Kinds of Bottles</p>
<p>Collecting bottles can also get a lot of profit, but it takes up more space. Not long ago, a film needed ancient bottles from the Scandinavian Peninsula, and another one needed rare Chinese soy sauce bottles. People who collect bottles collect perfume bottles, laboratory bottles, medicine bottles, and various foreign bottles.</p>
<p>Studying Beards Is Worth Money</p>
<p>In movies, beard collectors are not needed, but there is a beard expert in Hollywood. He can tell you anything about the beard of a Russian duchess, the Teutonic beard, the Italian beard, and the Slavic beard. If there is any doubt, he can tell you if you pay a considerable fee.</p>
<p>Another strange occupation is an expert who collects epaulettes. There is a woman who can recite any dish, from ancient times to the present. The strangest occupation is that a person weaves spider webs by hand to shoot scenes of hell. His spider webs have a market. The price limit is high.</p>

<p>"Well, are you coming to the dinner of the whole class this time?" Dodo asked her sarcastically while collecting the monthly banquet expenses one evening. "Or are you still going to pay but not attend? What's the excuse tonight?"</p>
<p>Nana interrupted and said, "Don't you know, Dodo? She's going to the Siamese court, and her aunt is getting married to an Indian prince, so she has to attend two grand wedding banquets, and-"</p>
<p>Lovely Nana is always like this-used to sarcasm, she hates others, she wants to hurt others-the whole world, because she herself has been hurt. She wants to recklessly get what she can get, because the one thing she needs-the love of young Flower-already belongs to another woman.</p>
<p>Now she faced Louise, like a cat seeing a mouse, waiting for the opportunity to pounce on it and devour it. In the school hall, they were surrounded by many classmates, chatting and laughing in joy and leisure. They were ready to use others' consumption to make themselves happy. Interesting thing!</p>
<p>But Louise said, "If you want me to pay for the dinner, take it." Who cares if her finances are very difficult! "But you guessed right-I can't come, it's not that I don't want to-"</p>
<p>Nana laughed, "I guess you're dating some handsome young man. What are you doing every night?"</p>

<h3>South China Expeditionary Football Team; The Main Force Decides to Depart Today; The List of Players Was Decided Yesterday, About Seventeen People Will Depart Today; Li Huitang Will Depart After the Team Arrives in Surabaya</h3>
<p>The South China Expeditionary Football Team has decided to depart on the 30th of this month for the expedition. Team Leader Mai conducted a meticulous selection process, and the list of team members was finally decided yesterday. The trip will consist of a group of twenty people, led by Mo Qing, with Zhou Runnian as the accompanying staff member. Yang Loubao has also been selected to accompany the team. Shan Shijin of the Guanghua Association has also been granted leave to join the team. However, Li Huitang is temporarily unable to accompany the team due to busy official duties. However, the Surabaya side has sent a letter stating that they must have Li participate before they are welcome to go. Li agreed to the mother association's plan, so he will depart after the expedition team arrives in Surabaya. Li Shuoyou had previously been requested by South China to reduce the penalty period from the Football Association, but the association did not approve it, only allowing him to play in the British territory during this southern tour. Therefore, Li will also be able to go. The expedition team is scheduled to depart today at 2:00 PM (Guangdong) and will first arrive in Haiphong, Hanoi, and Saigon, then take the route through Singapore, and then to the Dutch East Indies (Java), the Philippines, and Yangon. It will take about three months before returning to Hong Kong. The list of team members is recorded below:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Li Guowei Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai Liu Sheng Yang Genbao Guo Yingqi</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Luo Douwen Zhuo Shijin Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Chen Dehui Feng Xiang Deng Guangsen Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Team Leader Mo Qing Staff Zhou Runnian</p>
<p>Another report states that the Southern Expedition Team will gather at the Queen's Pier today at 2:00 PM, take a barge to the French postal ship Guangdong, and set sail south at 4:00 PM, traveling to Haiphong, Hanoi, and Saigon in Annam; Georgetown, Butterworth, Singapore, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Penang in the Federated Malay States; Yangon in Burma; Medan in Sumatra; Batavia, Semarang, and Surabaya in Java; and Manila on the way back. They are expected to return to Hong Kong around early September.</p>
<p>The South China players officially met yesterday. Center Li Huitang was temporarily unable to accompany the team due to leave issues, and will take a plane to join the team when the Southern Expedition Team reaches Java. Football associations in various places in Java have contracts with the association, requiring Huitang to participate in the competition. Mai Shaohan's foot injury has not fully recovered, and he may not be able to enlist tomorrow. Left winger Li Shuoyou, although the "wave ban" has not expired, playing in French and Dutch territories does not conflict with British football regulations, and the team leader has decided that he should participate in the war. Because of the urgent time and incomplete procedures, he was unable to travel with the team. It is rumored that if the Southern Expedition Team needs to replenish its troops in the future, they will be called to go by telegram. As of 6:30 PM yesterday, there were about seventeen people who could depart for the Southern Expedition tomorrow, but the number may increase or decrease at that time, which will still be decided by Team Leader Mo.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Cup Postponed Due to Basketball Court Being Decorated</h3>
<p>The long-awaited Shen Bao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Tournament, originally scheduled to begin last night at the Central Youth Association, was suddenly canceled at 5:30 PM yesterday when a message was received from the Association Secretary stating that the basketball court was being decorated, forcing the postponement of both the women's charity tournament and the men's Second Division League. As a result, the audience who went to the venue last night were all disappointed and had to return home. The date of the postponement will be determined by the Association.</p>
<h3>Jian Quan Cup Charity Tournament: Championship Finals Approaching, Seven Male and Female Long-Term Winners Each</h3>
<p>The All-Hong Kong Open Men's and Women's Jian Quan Cup Table Tennis Team Competition, with a total of 36 teams participating in the preliminary and semi-final rounds, has recently concluded with great success, setting a new record in the history of table tennis competitions in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau. The issue of the venue for the men's and women's team championship, runner-up, and third-place finals has been resolved by Mr. Zhu. The association's staff have been actively working to arrange it, and the date should be announced soon. To increase the competition's interest, the organizers have calculated the individual match scores for both men and women. There are 14 players in total, male and female, who have exceeded eight-tenths of the possible points without losing or forfeiting. Ms. Yang Wei-bin, a versatile athlete from Hong Kong, has stated that she is willing to relinquish her right to the individual long-term championship final, thereby allowing other female players the opportunity to advance, which is a true example of sportsmanship.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Rain and Wind Did Not Cease; Baseball Game Again Unable to be Held; South China Team Adds Three New Players to Ranks; Yesterday's Joint Practice at South China Field</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, a makeup baseball game was scheduled between the South China Athletic Association and the American warship Mindanao. However, due to the brewing hurricane in Hong Kong, the American warship personnel could not leave their posts. Therefore, the regular game was repeatedly postponed. All South China Athletic Association players arrived on time. Finally, due to the Mindanao team's absence, the game could not be held. Yesterday, the South China Athletic Association had three new players join the ranks. After the announcement that there would be no game, they jointly practiced at the South China Athletic Association field. The new players He Xian-cheng and Huang Yao practiced batting, and Zheng Kang-yong practiced pitching frequently. They may play this Sunday against the strong team.</p>
<h3>Sampan Driving Method</h3>
<p>— Pan Congshao</p>
<p>1.  Not understanding the influence of the oar's path in the water on the boat's left and right movements—if this most basic principle of boating is not understood, one cannot steer a sampan alone. When two beginners steer a boat, they push left and pull right, but the boat always circles. Learners who have experienced this know that the force generated by the oar resisting the water changes the boat's direction depending on the oar's position in the water, with different positions causing smaller or greater changes. They realize that their previous hard work of blindly practicing was a waste of energy, and that there is a more convenient path.</p>
<p>2.  Not understanding the relationship between pushing the boat forward and controlling its direction—the action of pushing the boat is the easiest to do. Simply hold the oars with both hands, one high and one low, grasp the oar handles, sit on the side of the boat, insert the oar into the water in front of you, and drag it backward. Then, pull it out of the water behind you and repeat the motion to move the boat forward. However, it is important to know the path that the oar takes in the water during this simple action, as this is what controls the boat's direction and must be studied.</p>
<p>Based on the two reasons above, with dedicated practice, you can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>First, the main force for steering comes from the stern of the boat. Those practicing driving a sampan alone sit in the stern. If the oar's movement in the water is entirely at the end of the boat, the force to change the boat's direction is greater. Although beginners sitting in this position will initially find it difficult due to the strong changes in the boat's direction, they will be better able to observe how the oar's path in the water affects the boat's direction. Therefore, when learning, sitting at the very end of the boat is actually a way to facilitate driving the boat, and it is important to maintain this position.</p>
<p>Second, whether the body sits on the left or right side of the stern is irrelevant to learning and application. Take the method of turning the boat as an example: to turn the bow to the left, how is this done? The reason why the boat can change its direction of travel is that a force is exerted on one side of the boat to push it. Imagine that this force is generated by a single oar in the water at the stern. The water behind the boat must be subjected to the opposing force of the oar pushing from front to back and from right to left, and the bow will turn to the left. This is the application of force; one example can be applied to others. Although the actions may be different, as long as the principle of applying force is the same, the change in the boat's direction will be the same.</p>
<p>Third, if the seated position is still on the right side, there are two ways to turn the bow to the right. First, attach the oar to the side of the boat, that is, at the stern on the right side, holding it firmly with one hand, and frequently push the oar blade that is still in the water outward with the other hand. The direction will turn to the right. However, wanting to maintain the boat's speed while changing its direction of travel is an undesirable action. So, the second method is: this action is more difficult to learn, but must be mastered, otherwise the technique of driving a sampan alone cannot be further improved. The oar is still moved from front to back, but do not align the oar blade with the boat's direction. In other words, the oar blade that is pushing from front to back should be slanted toward the side of the boat, diagonally into the water, pushing from left to right. The bow will turn to the right.</p>
<p>Fourth, when driving the boat forward, combine the action of changing the boat's direction with the action of pushing the boat forward. Based on the explanations in the third and fourth points, in addition to needing to turn left or towards a turn, the actions of the previous two points must be performed. The boat's direction of travel must always be maintained straight ahead. This way, the route of travel can avoid curved movements, needlessly increasing the distance to be traveled, and can also avoid reducing the forward force due to the boat's swaying from side to side. How to maintain a constant direction of travel requires paying attention to maintaining the normal relationship between the direction and the oar's actions each time the oar is used to push the water.</p>
<p>Practice driving a sampan according to the four methods described above. With practice, you will become skilled, and there is no need to worry about being clumsy in application. (2)</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Recent Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shi Yiwu</p>
<p>Since the opening of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" on the 16th of this month, those unfamiliar with the situation have been anxious, believing that the value of the legal tender would suffer significant pressure and that the Shanghai financial market would inevitably be affected. However, as of now, the facts show that the value of the legal tender has not changed in the slightest, and the Shanghai financial market has not experienced any instability, proving that the worries caused by the establishment of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" were unfounded.</p>
<p>In fact, looking at the actual situation in the current Shanghai financial market, what has been affected by the establishment of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" is not China's legal tender, but the Japanese yen itself. Several days before the opening of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" (May 13), the black market exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the legal tender was 102 yuan of legal tender for 100 Japanese yen. However, since the 16th (the opening day of the Hwa Hsing Bank), the Japanese yen has fallen to be equivalent to the legal tender. To this day (May 20), it has fallen to only 95 yuan of legal tender for 100 Japanese yen (see yesterday's newspaper). Within this week, the Japanese yen has depreciated by more than eight yuan against the legal tender, and this downward trend may continue to develop in the future.</p>
<p>The depreciation of the Japanese yen did not start today. I recall that in June and July of last year, the market price of the Japanese yen in the open market was about 30% higher than that of the legal tender (i.e., 100 Japanese yen could be exchanged for about 130 yuan of legal tender). By September, it had dropped to 20% (i.e., 100 Japanese yen could be exchanged for 120 yuan of legal tender). By January and February of this year, it had fallen to 10% (i.e., 100 Japanese yen could be exchanged for 110 yuan of legal tender). Recently, it has even fallen below parity with the legal tender. If British currency is used for conversion, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen had already fallen from its benchmark exchange rate (one shilling and two pence) to ten pence in September of last year. By January and February of this year, it had fallen to nine pence, and recently it has fallen to about seven pence. This continuous downward trend of the Japanese yen is certainly not an accidental phenomenon, but has its objective reasons. It is worthy of our study.</p>
<p>In September of last year, when the Japanese yen's depreciation was at its most dramatic, I wrote an article for the Wenhui News (see the Economic Supplement of that newspaper on September 20), pointing out the reasons for its depreciation. Here is an excerpt from it for reference:</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the war in 1937, the amount of Japanese currency flowing into China has been no less than 200 million yuan, of which about 150 million yuan flowed into North China (mostly Bank of Chosen currency) and 50 million yuan flowed into the Jiangnan war zone (mostly Bank of Japan currency). The sources of these currencies were partly funds used by the Japanese army in the war zone for military supplies, and mostly the salaries of Japanese soldiers fighting in China. In February and March (last year), 50 million yuan of Japanese yen had already flowed into Shanghai. In May and June, some speculators used Shanghai's legal tender to buy up Japanese yen in North China, so Japanese yen in North China poured southward, and Shanghai became a place where Japanese yen were rampant. Since the number of Japanese yen in Shanghai had increased, if foreign exchange could be freely purchased, then its value would not be a problem. However, under the strict management of the Japanese government, applying for permission was required to purchase more than 100 yuan of foreign exchange, and the conditions were very harsh. Not only that, but Japanese banks in Shanghai also refused to accept transactions (such as export bills) that used Japanese yen to pay for goods exported from Japan (the purpose was to limit the export of goods without foreign exchange). Given the environment in which Japanese yen were located in Shanghai, and the Shanghai market's limited actual need for them, they became a currency that was half-paralyzed, and its drop in value was naturally inevitable."</p>
<p>The above is the general reason for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in September of last year. But what is the situation of the current depreciation of the Japanese yen? First, let's introduce the Japanese side's own explanation.</p>
<p>The Japanese believe that the biggest reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai are the following three points: First, it is the result of the restriction of the import of soybeans and soybean oil from the Northeast and North China into Central China. In the past, the value of soybeans and soybean oil imported into Shanghai from the Northeast and North China was about 2 to 3 million yuan per month. Now that Shanghai has no imports of these goods, Shanghai will have an excess of 2 to 3 million yuan of Japanese yen every month. The excess of Japanese yen in Shanghai naturally reduces the value of the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Second, it is due to the surge in the number of Japanese people coming to China, and Japanese yen are also brought in large quantities. According to the statistics for April, a total of 8,350 Japanese people came to Shanghai from Japan. If each person carries an average of 500 Japanese yen, then 4 million Japanese yen will flow into Shanghai in one month, and 50 million yen in one year. In the Shanghai financial market, where the Japanese yen has no established position, it is naturally difficult to accommodate such a huge amount of money. This will inevitably affect the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Third, it is due to Japan's restrictions on the export of goods to China, reducing the need for Japanese yen. As the supply of Japanese goods in the occupied areas decreases, the people in the occupied areas will naturally use the military currency issued by Japan, transport it to Shanghai, exchange it for Japanese yen, and then exchange the Japanese yen for legal tender, and use the legal tender to purchase the necessary materials from foreign or Chinese merchants. Therefore, as a result of the large demand for legal tender by the people in the occupied areas, the Japanese yen will naturally be under pressure and depreciate (see the Shanghai Daily News on May 19).</p>
<p>We also admit that the above three situations are indeed the reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen, but they are only superficial reasons, derived reasons. The fundamental reason lies in the national strength of Japan, in other words, in the purchasing power of the Japanese yen. We know that since Japan launched the war against China, the military expenses it has consumed have totaled hundreds of millions of yuan. The consumption of military expenses is in fact the consumption of material resources, which is also the consumption of national strength. If Japan's productivity is sufficient to adapt to the huge military consumption, then it would not be a problem for the Japanese government to mobilize the materials needed for the war through the financial system. However, everyone knows that Japan's productivity is very fragile. Not only has it failed to supplement the materials needed for the war due to the large consumption of the war, but it has also become increasingly evident that its productivity is strained and heading towards exhaustion due to the large consumption of material resources and manpower by the war. Now the Japanese government is only relying on the method of draining the pond to catch all the fish, issuing more banknotes and creating new purchasing power to conscript the savings of the people and maintain its foreign war. Just look at the amount of Japanese yen banknotes issued, which has increased from 150 million yuan in June 1937 to about 250 million yuan at present (it once increased to 290 million yuan at the end of last year). In the 20 months after the war, the amount of new purchasing power (banknotes) has increased by nearly one time compared to before, while its domestic materials (including savings and productivity) have not increased in proportion to the amount of counterfeit purchasing power (in fact, it is decreasing). Therefore, the relative balance between purchasing power and materials is lost. What is expressed domestically is the soaring prices, and what is expressed abroad is the drop in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>The current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is also evidence of its reduced purchasing power. However, the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is not only a depreciation against legal tender (because the value of legal tender has not changed), but also a depreciation against all foreign currencies. However, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons for the reduction in purchasing power, there are two other reasons for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai that cannot be ignored:</p>
<p>First, the recent depreciation of the puppet Federal Reserve Notes in North China has caused the Japanese yen to depreciate as well. The depreciation of the puppet Federal Reserve Notes is due to the financial needs of the puppet government in North China and the Japanese army, which have led to indiscriminate issuance on the one hand, and due to the people's fear of the value of the puppet Federal Reserve Notes, who have exchanged the puppet Federal Reserve Notes for goods (or legal tender) on the other hand. Due to the equivalent relationship between the puppet Federal Reserve Notes and the Japanese yen, the value of the Japanese yen has also been lowered. Therefore, some speculators (including Japanese) bought Japanese yen in North China with legal tender, and then transported the Japanese yen to Shanghai to buy legal tender, which made the need for Japanese yen in Shanghai even greater and put pressure on its value to depreciate.</p>
<p>Second, the issuance plan of "Hwa Hsing Bank" banknotes will inevitably reduce the actual need for Japanese yen invisibly. At the same time, because the "Hwa Hsing Bank" banknotes are not issued indiscriminately (like the situation of the puppet banknotes in North China), Japan has long known this consequence, so it announced that the "Hwa Hsing Notes" are not linked to the Japanese yen, which is tantamount to reflecting the emptiness of the Japanese yen's foundation. Therefore, most people (including Japanese) dare not collect Japanese yen, and would rather exchange it for legal tender with a more certain value (or purchase goods), thus relatively increasing the value of legal tender and causing the value of the Japanese yen to decline step by step.</p>
<p>The above two reasons can powerfully promote the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai, precisely because the fundamental purchasing power of the Japanese yen has been reduced, which can also be said to be the result of currency inflation. What this shows is not only the shaking of the external credit of the Japanese yen, but also the serious losses suffered by Japan in the war against China. If the war cannot be ended, then the consumption of Japan's national strength will definitely increase with each passing day, and the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will inevitably deteriorate day by day. The deterioration of the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will not only make it difficult for it to maintain the war, but also promote the total collapse of its entire national economy. The continuous depreciation of the Japanese yen at present shows that Japan is already on the road to total collapse. On the contrary, the current stability of the value of legal tender and the relative appreciation of the value of the Japanese yen are proof of the correctness of China's long-term war of attrition strategy, indicating that China is on the road to a military advantage. Final victory is no problem.</p>

<h3>Hua Hing Bank and the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>— Xin Hai</p>
<p>The so-called "Hua Hing Commercial Bank" has a very small impact on the Shanghai market. There are various rumors circulating, but as long as ordinary people don't disturb themselves, "Hua Hing" can't do anything.</p>
<p>However, when the news of the establishment of "Hua Hing" came out, the black market exchange rate for legal tender (fabi), especially for forward contracts, tightened for a while. This was probably because the market was not calm at first and lacked understanding of it. Once its nature and tricks were understood, things immediately became stable as usual. But when it opened on the sixteenth, all kinds of unfounded rumors were spread again, causing the sensitive market to be ridiculously tossed around again. The black market price of public bonds suddenly dropped. The rumors I heard were roughly of four types:</p>
<p>1.  It was said that the National Government, in order to resist "Hua Hing's" attempt to seize fabi, planned to replace fabi over five yuan with "drawing rights" (huatou) in circulation, leaving only small denominations of less than one yuan in circulation. In the future, only drawing rights could be used to purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<p>2.  It was said that the National Government would henceforth pay all principal and interest on public bonds in Chongqing, no longer using the method of "paying once in Chongqing and paying in six installments in Shanghai," in order to reduce the inflow of fabi into Shanghai.</p>
<p>3.  It was said that the legal tender issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be gradually withdrawn, allowing the banknotes and miscellaneous notes issued by the remaining eight legal commercial banks to circulate, and that these non-Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications banknotes would not be eligible to purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<p>4.  It was said that the existing fabi foreign exchange stabilization fund would be divided among China, Britain, and the United States, and would only be supplied to China, Britain, and the United States. Ordinary needs would not be supplied for the time being.</p>
<p>These rumors actually caused some people in the market to become impulsive, which is really a lack of judgment. First, regarding the first point, the wise authorities would never take such a measure to reduce the prestige of fabi. Because if only drawing rights are allowed to purchase foreign exchange, then fabi converted to drawing rights will inevitably be at a discount. A discount on fabi is the same as a depreciation of fabi. Moreover, fabi can still purchase foreign exchange after paying the discount and converting to drawing rights. How can the attempt to prevent the fake "Hua Hing" from seizing foreign exchange by sucking up fabi be prevented by simply adding a procedure for converting to drawing rights? It is likely that this rumor originated from the fact that foreign banks' drawing rights are quoted at a premium against fabi. It is true that foreign banks prefer to receive drawing rights to avoid the complexity of fabi calculations, but this does not mean that drawing rights will replace fabi in circulation. This is very clear.</p>
<p>The second point is equally ridiculous. Even if the National Government wants to contract the fabi in the war zone, it does not need to harp on this old tune. Moreover, the government is determined to maintain its credit and will not rescind its previous promises. Furthermore, the government can restrict the flow of fabi to Shanghai in other ways. Why must it plan on the payment of principal and interest on public bonds?</p>
<p>The third point is also impossible. If the National Government withdraws the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications and allows miscellaneous notes to circulate, wouldn't that be like the government slapping itself in the face? The banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are fabi, and those issued by other commercial banks are also fabi. The former can purchase foreign exchange, while the latter cannot. Wouldn't this be destroying the already unified currency system itself? Even in the Tianjin Concession, there will never be a withdrawal of fabi. On the contrary, when funds from North China fled south, the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Tianjin restricted outward remittances and maintained the original circulation of fabi in North China. Because if fabi were withdrawn, there would be no currency available for circulation in the concession. Then, counterfeit currency could take the opportunity to seize the area where fabi circulates. Would the government authorities be so foolish?</p>
<p>Finally, everyone knows that the establishment of the fabi stabilization fund is to stabilize the external value of fabi. Therefore, anyone who holds fabi, whether they are Chinese or British merchants, can purchase foreign exchange if necessary. Fabi holders have different nationalities, but the value of fabi does not differ depending on the nationality of the holder. Therefore, the idea of dividing up the fabi stabilization fund is not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. There are many ways to prevent the inflow of funds to the fake "Hua Hing," such as not allowing domestic products to fall into the hands of the Japanese puppets and not buying Japanese goods.</p>
<p>In fact, even without the above analysis, the stabilization of the market today and the recovery of various bonds can prove the unreliability of these rumors.</p>

<h3>Reminiscences of May Thirtieth</h3>
<p>— Ji Zi</p>
<p>As the 30th of May approaches, one cannot help but think of Shanghai and the arrogance of the Japanese. The year before the August 13th Incident, I first arrived in Shanghai and stayed in a hotel on North Sichuan Road, intending to take the entrance exam. Every evening, after studying, I always liked to invite a few friends to walk along Avenue Edward VII. Wandering through the Westernized streets, I would occasionally see a small squad of Japanese soldiers patrolling everywhere. They walked naturally, as if they were walking on their own territory, which made one angry. When passing the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps in Hongkou, most passersby would hurry past, seemingly afraid to look at it, lest the Japanese soldiers cause trouble for no reason and suffer a loss. The same was true for the Japanese barracks near the shooting range. People dared not look directly at it, as if they had seen a living Yama. Newcomers always felt extremely surprised, and I was one of them. At that time, not only were the Japanese soldiers awe-inspiring, but even some idle vagrants with knives were very fierce and savage. When extremely bored, they loved to pretend to be drunk and beat Chinese people everywhere, intending to start trouble. Those who were unfortunately slapped dared not speak out, enduring the humiliation and avoiding the situation. No one wanted to cause trouble because of this. I saw the same thing several times, and each time I was so angry that I couldn't speak. Later, I went to Great China University. Near the school was the Toyota Cotton Mill, a large-scale Japanese cotton mill. Troops were stationed in the factory to protect it. These troops not only protected the cotton mill, but also sent teams day and night to guard the Jinghu Railway passing nearby, checking whether there were troop movements. The cotton mill also built a high platform for observation, looking very imposing, as if they were the masters of Shanghai. In winter, a strike broke out at the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai. When it spread from the factories in Yangshupu to the Toyota Cotton Mill in Fanduatu, the Japanese also sent many marines and tanks to suppress the Chinese male and female workers. The end of Zhongshan Bridge near the cotton mill was full of marines and police, while the other end was full of Chinese police. In the middle were the striking workers. The situation was extremely tense. A single spark could cause a major conflict. Unexpectedly, the Japanese troops threw tear gas to disperse the workers. The order was suddenly disrupted, and the Zhongshan Road area suddenly became riotous. We, the unarmed workers, finally retreated in a very sorry state. I lived in Shanghai for less than a year, and all I saw were the violent acts of the Japanese rushing around, and the Chinese, due to the circumstances, had no better way to deal with it except to endure with tears. At that time, the arrogance of the Japanese was at its peak.</p>
<p>But there is a limit to endurance. Shortly after the July 7th Incident, the August 13th Resistance began. On the Bund, I saw Chinese planes bombing the Izumo warship day and night for the first time. The Japanese barracks, which the Chinese had always bowed their heads and dared not look at, were also completely destroyed. The Toyota Cotton Mill on the south bank of Suzhou Creek, a den of demons where thousands of Chinese workers had been beaten and abused in the past, was also marked with our artillery shell scars. At this time, the "Imperial Army" that used to stand guard with angry eyes and the arrogant vagrants were all gone. All we could see was the national flag on the Four Banks Warehouse and the heroic posture of the Eight Hundred Warriors, and all we could hear was the roar of our artillery fire in Pudong. Where had the Japanese, the "proud sons of Shanghai," gone?</p>
<p>As the 30th of May approaches, the police in the Shanghai Concessions will inevitably be busy again. But this year's May Thirtieth is not the May Thirtieth of fourteen years ago. At that time, our lives were in the hands of others. Other people's bayonets were pressing against our chests. But what about now? The spirit of resistance sparked by May Thirtieth has permeated over ten million square kilometers and been implanted in the hearts of four hundred and fifty million people. The death of a worker in a cotton mill in those days has now been repaid with the casualties of seven million soldiers and the expenditure of seven million yuan. Yan Qi.</p>
<h3>The Newness of New Poetry</h3>
<p>— Yan Qi</p>
<p>So-called "new poetry," from a certain point of view, certainly has "new" forms, "new" styles, "new" emotions, and "new" meanings; but what remains in the minds of ordinary people as "new poetry" is nothing more than "vernacular written in separate lines." In fact, the "newness" of "new poetry" is definitely not just about separating lines or using vernacular sentences; because "new poetry" is not only "new," but also "poetry."</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Ke Ke wrote an article on poetry, in which there is a sentence that is still worth mentioning now, taking it as a new saying.</p>
<p>He said: "All poems that describe scenery, generate feelings, lament the times, mourn events, praise objects, express sentiments, respond to poems, and give gifts, even if they are created, cannot be considered new poetry."</p>
<p>His meaning is that you cannot find "newness" in the old circle, and something new will never hide in the old circle. "New poetry" jumps out of the old circle of "old poetry"; having jumped out, of course, there is no need to turn back and reach a hand back, resulting in only new formats and no new qualities. For example, ancient people liked to write poems about the secluded life of mountains and forests, all because their lives could have the secluded life of mountains and forests. They sat by the spring in thatched pavilions, dipping their brushes and composing poems, and of course, what they wrote was that kind of leisurely thing. This thing is in the old cabinet and is naturally "old poetry." But if today's poets also write reclusive, secluded poems, one can tell at a glance that they have fallen for the ancients' tricks and old clichés. Where can we find reclusive mountains and forests now? Even if we find them, can we live in seclusion peacefully? Can we write poems leisurely? Unfortunately, today's world does not allow for such things.</p>
<p>However, too realistic commodities are all vulgar things in the eyes of poets. Western-style houses, cars, and airplanes are all considered "scientific" and not worthy of being included in poetry—therefore, "new poets" are in a dilemma. Learning from the ancients is not suitable, and taking out their own things is too vulgar, so they can only revolve around women's legs. And what about the so-called "new poetry"? The format is "new," the subject matter is "new," but after being "new," it falls into another "old" realm.</p>
<p>"New" and "old" are representatives of "before" and "after." When I see the line written in separate lines, "Alas—where is my home!" all I see is a piece of "old" and a pile of "backwardness." If "this" is also considered a new poem—then I really have to wonder.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you write a march, even if there is less "poetic" meaning, perhaps more "new" flavor can be retained; then at least give me a little "new" feeling.</p>
<p>It seems that some people think that writing poetry in a foreign format makes it new even if it is not new. This really makes me laugh! It was not easy for "new poetry" to get out of the shackles of the "old poetry" style. If it then voluntarily drills into foreign shackles, it is predictable that it cannot completely become "new." I personally feel that it is better to use the style of lyrics than to put a foreign shackle on "new poetry." Because since you are afraid of something going wrong without shackles, then why not be more content and not jump out of the inherent formal track, just look for "newness" in terms of quality and nature. At the same time, on the old forms and old styles, not only should we not ignore them, but we should even pay more attention to them. We must be able to find "oldness" in the "old" before we can create a new soul. But blindly describing scenery, generating feelings, lamenting the times, praising objects, expressing sentiments, and responding to poems, always playing around with the same old set, even if the person is "new," the poem is "old." Now, let me quote a few words from T.S. Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent" to make it clear: "No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not one-sided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new."</p>
<h3>The Eve of the Retreat from Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>"You have a new mission. You must cross the river today. The army commander is somewhere moored in Shangxinhe. Go and find him quickly." A certain department director said calmly and sternly. From his usual bureaucratic expression, it was difficult to gauge the fate of the front line.</p>
<p>"Then let's go!" The four of us accepted from the director's plantain-like palm a sum of money sufficient to support us for half a year.</p>
<p>Blanket, food bag, thermos. Fully armed, like a traveling camel. There was no joy or sorrow on the faces of the comrades. Their expressions were still so tranquil. We said goodbye to the director and the staff of another department and left the mouth of this great monster. The weak sun was hanging overhead. It was noon, but we hadn't thought about eating.</p>
<p>We left Yijiang Gate and stepped onto the embankment full of potholes; every five or six steps there was a deep pit. We found shell fragments, but we didn't dodge.</p>
<p>It was evening when we reached Shangxinhe. It was a small town by the river. Here, there were no shops open, but the people were still scattered on the streets.</p>
<p>"I don't know when we'll be able to come back here after leaving today?" Across from where we were standing, an old woman in a tofu shop was laboriously moving a large vat; but there was no sadness on her face.</p>
<p>"One day this place will be ours again. Just wait!" A young man, probably her son, was actively helping to move things, his spirit extremely excited.</p>
<p>They looked at us with sincere smiles; but there was no conversation. They were too busy.</p>
<p>After two hours of searching through the nearby small ports, we didn't find a single ship. The sun had been completely swallowed by the earth. The surroundings were eerily quiet; punctuated only by the approaching dense machine gun fire and intermittent small cannon fire.</p>
<p>"Report, officer!" A brother covered in mud and ash ran over hurriedly. The sweat on his forehead dripped down, a large patch was wet on his chest, and he was panting hard.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"May I ask where our machine gun company is? Battalion Commander so-and-so ordered me to inform them to prepare for battle. The enemy is about two miles away from here..." he said quickly.</p>
<p>"We don't know. We are from such-and-such unit. Please ask on the front hill," we expressed our deep regret that we couldn't give him an answer.</p>
<p>But how stimulating was this sudden news? Should we wait? Or return to the city? These two questions swirled in the minds of each comrade. Finally, we decided: if we made contact, we would actively display our power.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an officer in a black military uniform ran over from the distance:</p>
<p>"Are you from the ×× Division? Is the division commander ×××?" he said, looking at our unit number. He was quite young, the local police chief, still searching and patrolling in the darkness for duty reasons.</p>
<p>"Yes!" we answered in unison. Although the words were so simple, everyone was full of enthusiasm, with a common thought in their hearts:</p>
<p>"If we make contact, then we will have this military officer with military knowledge to contact each other with us."</p>
<p>We started chatting with him, and he was very familiar with the situation of our division.</p>
<p>"—You'd better go back to the city," he said slowly. Perhaps he was afraid that we didn't know the situation here.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's impossible to return to the city!" A comrade with glasses, whom we called Little Kai, said.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true. There's a shortcut from here to Shuixi Gate. It's only six or seven miles!" He looked at his watch. "Ah—7:30. Judging from the time, the city gate may not have been blown up before you reach the gate."</p>
<p>He carefully told us the ordinary and special passwords and drew a simple map.</p>
<p>For the sake of our mission, we parted ways with him.</p>
<p>On the broken, uneven brick road flowed crowds of refugees and armed comrades.</p>
<p>Dense machine gun fire, mixed with small mortars; children's cries, accompanied by dog barks; the whistling of bullets and the playing of whistles, the sky was even darker. But the surrounding of the city was burning with wildfire, and the red light shone in the sky.</p>
<p>We passed through it with hurried breathing and quick steps.</p>
<p>The outline of the city could only be distinguished in the firelight, and we breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The city bridge was full of explosives and wires. It would complete its mission in a very short time and destroy itself.</p>
<p>Led by an officer from a friendly army, we crossed the fully armed city bridge.</p>
<p>We threw ourselves back into the arms of the ancient city, and our pace slowed down a lot. Chen Xingmou</p>
<h3>The Final Victory</h3>
<p>— Chen Xingmou</p>
<p>The Zhao brothers had just returned from playing billiards at Mr. Li's mansion and were lying tired on the soft sofas.</p>
<p>"Second brother," the elder Zhao said, flicking the ash of his Three Fives cigarette and teasing his brother, "Why is your school so annoying, with classes every day? Miss Zhu and Miss He are looking for us to go for a drive tomorrow. Are you still going to school?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll go for a drive with you," said the second brother, who hadn't returned to C University for several days and had originally planned to go back to attend Professor Li's constitutional law class tomorrow. However, in order to avoid being a "weakling," he immediately dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>"I heard that Wang Aimei has arrived here. Let's go to Zhonghua with Lao Li tonight."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>"But what, second brother?" said the elder Zhao impatiently.</p>
<p>"How much do you have left? I only have twenty yuan left." The second brother, who was usually very optimistic, was a little worried at this moment.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! I thought you were worried about something!" He immediately pressed the call bell. As soon as he put his hand down, a servant came in.</p>
<p>"Ah He, get me a seal and withdraw two hundred yuan from Manager Xu at the company. Also, get the new white 'sand-proof' suit ready for tonight."</p>
<p>"Yes, young master," Ah He retreated respectfully and quickly. The elder Zhao smiled at the second brother, as if mocking him for not being as smart as he was.</p>
<p>Darkness gradually enveloped the ground, but in this "city that never sleeps," they did not feel how dark it was, because the city was decorated with red and green neon tubes and firework-like lights. A 1939 Lincoln, carrying three young men in white, quickly passed through the crowded crowd. Although it gradually became smaller, smaller and disappeared; however, in the middle of the crowd, they could still smell a burst of perfume.</p>
<p>Hou Ou, dressed in a smart and tidy uniform, bent over and bowed a ninety-degree bow to welcome their three patrons to their seats, opening champagne, buying tickets, they were all busy.</p>
<p>"Chen, ce; Chen, ce..." The latest entertainment theme song began to play, and pairs of dancers followed the dance. The elder Zhao hurried up to find his intended dance partner, but when he went to her, she had already been taken away by another man. He, who had come in high spirits, was now disappointed and angry, replacing the joy that existed in his mind.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Zhao—are you getting a return ticket?" "Bobo" Sun saw his flushed face and seemed to already know the general situation.</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" He added a lot of courage after seeing Bobo, and when the second piece of music started, he opened to her front at the highest speed, this time, he no longer failed, the beauty was in his arms, however, the anger still not disappeared.</p>
<p>In the center of the smooth dance floor, a dancer hugging a dance girl who was not fat or thin wanted to swim elsewhere, but forward, backward, left, or right, he was fail, he was surrounded, eager, trying to break through, but still being besieged.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Do you know Mr. Zhao now? Huh—you dare to compete with me?" Having endured for a long time, the elder Zhao erupted.</p>
<p>"Boy! Do whatever you want. Say it, if you have the guts!" Bobo was in the form of a bulletin of beauty like a book. The words and attitudes of the seven or eight besiegers made the man feel greatly threatened.</p>
<p>A burst of applause drowned out the tail of this jazz music. The elder Zhao glared at him fiercely, then used his right hand to tightly hug her slender waist, and walked back to their table with a triumphant mood. He conquered his enemy; conquered the beautiful sheep, and conquered everything!</p>
