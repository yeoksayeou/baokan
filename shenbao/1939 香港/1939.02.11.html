<p>社評</p>
<h3>日軍在海南島登陸</h3>
<p>日本××部隊已於昨日破曉前在海南島作大規模的登陸，登陸地點，規尙未得確實情報，但料我瓊崖守軍，與當地民衆，已在英勇迎擊。我高級軍事當局對此雖未有所發表，第就一般觀察，對於華南戰局的趨向，表示重視其前途。</p>
<p>日×在海南島登陸，决不是一伴無足輕重的事。不僅對於華南戰局，對於中國抗戰局面，將有極重大的影響，而且對於遠東國際形勢，對於當前世界大戰——兩條陣綫戰爭的前途，都有極重大的影響。我們願就平日觀察所得，伸述下列各點，以喚起國人與友邦之注意。</p>
<p>海南島是我國南部國防第一綫的重要據點，是我西南抗戰根據地最重要的屏藩，也是英法等國維護其遠東權益的重要門戶；同時又是日本法西斯侵略者完成大陸政策展開海洋攻略時期必須首先佔領的要地。因此日本××對於侵略海南島，更是處心積慮，已非一朝一夕。自從我國抗×戰爭全面開展以後，日本少壯派軍事領袖，尤其是海軍方面的領袖，更曾一再倡議「要征服中國必先實行華南攻略，要完善遂行華南攻略，必先佔領廣州尤其是海南島」。去年廣州尙未失陷以前，日×卽曾一面發動所謂『進攻蘇聯』的張鼓峯的挑釁，以轉移世人的視綫，一面偷襲海南島，企圖一舉佔領。當時幸得我方嚴密注意，喚起國際注意，並得蘇聯嚴正英勇粉碎日軍挑釁計劃，揭破日方煙幕毒計，而法國當局亦能迅作強硬表示，使日方冒險計劃全部失敗。然日×陰謀，則曾無一日不在進行之中。</p>
<p>廣州淪陷以後，日×封鎖我國海岸切斷我與外國交通輸運貿易的計劃，瀕於全部完成，日本軍事當局認爲唯一遺憾的，就是海南島的未獲佔領，使我國在南方戰場上依舊保持相當主動優勢地位，而英法對遠東關係亦依舊保持相當主動優勢地位，阻碍了日本××西侵南犯計劃的遂行。所以日×目前對華南攻略，除了極力鞏固廣州的佔領以外，便傾全力佈置海南島的佔奪，及對南路的窺伺。關於此點，我們曾在「世界動向一週間」中一再指出，以期喚起各方的警備。</p>
<p>日×蓄謀旣久而猶未敢發動對海南島的軍事行動者，一方面由於本身兵力的不足，軍事首腦對於強佔海南島以後的步驟，簡直毫無把握。另一方面則由於窺伺英法當局對於遠東的態度。但是，現在日×終於發動了強佔海南島的軍事了，是不是日×方面這兩個疑難問題已經獲得解决了呢？我們可分兩點囘答：第一，最近英法兩國對於意大利侵略西班牙事件的繼續妥協，意大利侵略者在西班牙的「勝利」及其所引起的歐洲嚴重局勢，首先壯丁太了日本××在遠東特是向西南實行冒險的胆量；第二，日本軍費困竭是當前嚴重問題，將於四月一日開始的下年度龐大軍事費七十三萬萬日圓預算案，就要在這幾天向議會提請核准，日本海陸軍當局必須趕製嚴重事態，俾使龐大軍費預算獲得順利通過。觀乎這幾天日僞蘇邊境的日×對蘇挑釁，繼之卽有昨天日×在海南島的登陸事件發生，當可明瞭其動機與其企圖。</p>
<p>海南島與我國南部抗戰關係的重要，固爲盡人皆知的事實，海南島對於英美法國維護遠東權益關係的重要，亦爲舉世識者所共見，如果海南島一旦爲日軍强佔，則不僅可以作爲進攻廣西，西則截我華南唯一國際通路，北則迂迴湘桂打通粵漢全綫，同時並可爲日本法西斯依據海洋攻略實行西侵南犯的根據地，如此則不僅將影響法屬安南全部海岸綫，且將威脅英國美國及其他國家在新嘉坡以東的航運，與一切貿易權益。猶憶去年三月，法國政府曾因日軍企圖窺伺海南島而向日方提送照會，聲明法國與中國訂有條約，在此條約中法國有禁止外國人在海南島登陸的義務，其後英國負責當局亦曾表示贊同法國此種態度，而對日本有所警吿。所以日×現在竟在海南島登陸，實屬×××××××××，實屬××××××及其他遠東有關係國家××××，我們所以應該特別指出日×在海南島登陸爲一嚴重的國際事件，理由亦在於此。</p>
<p>日×在海南島登陸事態的嚴重性，是我們所必須指出而喚起國人與友邦注視的，但是我們對于日×此舉，不僅不感到絲毫恐懼，而且使我們更加振奮堅持團結抗戰的勇氣。因爲第一，從軍事上講，我們過去在海南　的部署雖然未能完全滿意，駐軍數量亦大戚不足，尤其是關於民衆動員方面，政冶宣傳方面，均嫌不够，但是該島已有經驗豐富組織嚴密的遊擊隊，其富於愛國心與民族意識的民衆，更將在由紅軍改編的革命軍隊領導之下，展開保鄉衛國的戰鬥，而予日×以重大打擊。其次在地形上言，海南島爲山嶺層叠之區，日×活動異常困難，高達五千尺又加物產豐富的五指山，夙爲紅軍强固的根據地，必將成爲抗日根據，使日×不能有較長時期的立足。最後我們還不應忽視日×兵力不足的困難，依然沒有解决辦法，也許日軍這次登陸，又會演出×××××醜劇。不過我們仍就不能不要求國人與友邦人士注意的：第一，是日×此次在海南島的登陸，不問其用意爲對內威脅與對××挑釁試探，抑或兩者兼具，日×今後西侵南犯的冒險，今後必隨意德在歐洲的進展而更趨猖狂；因此我們不僅必須加強西南國防，並須促督英法兩國採取更積極的政策，用進一步援華制日的行動，來同答日×這種無理的挑釁。第二，是日×頗有利用一部份英法統治者妥協政策的陰謀，他們將以強佔海南島作爲舉行國際會議時爭取優利條件的地步，他們將藉以要脅英法統治者出而調停『中日衝突』，他們將藉以要脅法國封鎖對華交通運輸國際路綫，而便利其西南攻略的遂行。英法統治者相據不甚正確的觀察，彼等固不願我國亡於日本，更不顧中國在蘇聯援助之下戰勝日×實現解放，因此調停『中日衝突』的準備，可說從未放鬆一步。現在我們應該更明白的忠告懷有這種謬誤觀念的友邦人士，指出英法與中國利害一致的新形勢，要求勿受日本陰謀毒計所中，共爲維護遠東安全而切實制裁日×。</p>
<h3>世界向一週間</h3>
<p>— 朗潘</p>
<p>從廿八年二月四日至十日</p>
<p>是春天了！雖然國際風雲是那麽險惡，雖然祖國的烽火是那麽飛舞，但是，反抗的血旗，已在全世界被侵略被壓迫大衆中高揚起來！勝利的號昔，已在鼓勵着每一個求自由的見女，更英勇地奪鬥前進！</p>
<p>春節第一週的時事，吿訴我們：法西斯侵略者，日德意三國的統治者，是更加猖狂地準備着對內壓迫，向外發展；英法等民主國家，已經喊出了反抗優略的吼聲，但是他們還是幻想多於决心；只有社會主義祖國的蘇聯，在歐洲，在遠東，再一次地表現了以實力保衛和平與各民埃獨立的决心。回頭來看我們祖國，依舊在×人的炮火彌漫之下，然而×人的聲勢已漸衰落，×人的危機愈趨嚴重，反之，我們的聲勢則日趨浩大，我們的危機正在急轉。因此，我們認定：不問是世界或是中國，法西斯侵略者正在準備其最後的一逞，而我們反抗的力量還待加倍努力，去增畏去發展！</p>
<p>趁此春天新到、大家振作精神，爲民族求解放，爲人類求自由，而多多出點力吧！</p>
<p>一週間戰局鳥瞰</p>
<p>雖然各地×軍開始更大規模的蠢動，這一週的戰局，依然保持相當的穩定。窺測×軍目的，主要的顯圖以各綫亂動來迷惑我軍，一面加緊佔領地區統治的鞏固，游擊隊的『淸掃』，一面調集相當大兵團的部隊，準備大規模的進攻，先說華北，×方近來擴大宣傳大舉進攻西北，華中華北各地的×軍，亦確有若干旅團向豫習西調，同時一路北由察綏謀犯寧夏甘肅，一路東由豫晉再度强渡黃河。因此本週內綏遠山西各地激戰展開，風陵渡及晉東戰事尤烈。結果是兩路×軍先後在我陸空大軍聯合作戰下潰退，五日我空軍轟炸運城×機場，×機西十餘架，悉遭炸燬。又晋南中條山區，兩星期來即已殲×七八千人。而我軍在冀中豫東，及冀察晉邊猛烈反攻，又予應援之×以重大打擊。現在西北各族軍民關係愈趨融洽，×軍內部鬨鬥劇烈，所謂總攻西北，一時决難實現。再說華南，×司令安藤於二日在廣州召開陸海空軍事會議，對於打通粵漢路的戰事，結果毫無把握，乃决定首先大舉西侵，業由台灣增調戰艦廿四艘，協同空陸軍，以洲島爲根據，以北海爲門戶，第一步圖佔海南島，積極推進西犯南侵計劃。故一週來東江北江×軍僅屬虛張聲勢，西江南路則愈趨緊張，現我廣東軍事，已有新的佈置，北路由余漢謀負實，實行攻勢防禦；東路路由吳奇偉指揮，展開游擊攻勢；西路由夏威負責。日來北路我軍三路反攻，太平塲赤白坭兩處戰事激烈，反攻東江準備亦大致就緒，東莞，寶安，惠陽，博雜，河源，增城各地游擊部隊已在積極充實，西江我陸空密切聯絡，將分三路挺進，右翼以鶴山爲根據，奪取九江，沿江佛公路向兩龍佛山掃蕩，左翼以蘆苞爲根據，切斷廣雲禪炭兩路，配合右翼，包圍廣三路，截斷廣州與西江前綫×軍聯絡，南路方面立由精銳增防，西南情勢雖緊，大局尙無足慮。（寫稿至此，得悉今天十日晨，×軍一部在海南島登陸，當另撰社評，請參閱。）至於華中×軍，雖在鄂中及湘贛邊活動，但無任何進展。我軍自二日南昌軍事會議後，對於制止×軍進窺長沙南昌，已有充分把握。此外，針對×軍『淸播』游擊隊的計劃，一週來北戰塲東戰塲的游擊戰鬥，亦有更重大的發展，東戰場上我軍克復羅店寶山，而新四軍則吸引五萬×兵於京杭路上；北戰場上，冀察交界魯東北各地均有激戰，在平綏平漢平瀋津浦各綫牽制了大量的×軍。使南北各戰場正面我軍獲得更大發展的機會。</p>
<p>我軍政外交情勢</p>
<p>這一星期以來我國軍政外交後方建設及淪陷區的戰門與建設工作，都有相當重大的進展。首先是我軍戰鬥力的日益壯大。</p>
<p>兵力壯大</p>
<p>馮玉祥將軍於本月四日在重慶報吿，曾特別强調此點。並列舉以下事實：（一）目前華北僅河北一省，我方即擁有兵力二十萬，統治八十餘縣，平均每日殺×三四百人，（二）東北游擊工作政治工作將有更進一步之進展。白崇禧將軍於本月六日在昆明演講，亦以抗戰十九月經過証明我軍戰們力愈戰愈壯大，我在軍事上政治上經濟上國際上絕對有利。全塲萬餘聽衆熱烈鼓掌歡呼。本月七日蘇聯眞理報更用『新中國在長成中」的大標題，論述我國兵力壯大與國共合作進步，抗戰前途樂觀。路透計記者沙遜自越南經桂滇入川，亦有重要電報拍出，指出我國勝利前途。</p>
<p>軍政統一</p>
<p>最高國防委員會的組織，於本月七日發表，由國民黨總裁蔣先生兼任委員長。常委十一人，亦由各部院長等兼任，並以張羣爲秘書長，其組織及使命，雖與以前外電所傳頗有出入，但第一，這個會必然將使全國軍事政治黨務民運諸端，獲得統一領導，對於抗戰，助益自屬不小。其次，在這抗戰新階段，只有使政治更加進步，使各黨各界團結更加鞏固，才能保証抗戰建國的順利進行，爭取最後勝利。我們相信政府對此方面的努力，一定將有事實昭示。</p>
<p>國際援助</p>
<p>國際方面對我援助，本週內亦有很多表現。特別値得報吿的：第一是四日華盛頓電稱，中國銀幽代表陳光甫又與某財團進行信用貸欵談判，結果成立一千五白萬美金的信用借欵，用以增强我國貨幣。第二，是八日倫敦電稱，英金融界對我國維持債信，反響良佳，對華進一步財政援助，已在愼重考慮中，同時與討論中國需要問題最有直接關係的英政府官員，亦在商討予我國以信用貸欵，以開發西南經濟，並擬用實際借欵以支持我國幣制。第三是中英航空作　進一步的合作，港滇緬新空綫即將成立。此外，如本港英文南華早報七日刊載美政府各領袖一致熱烈援華，如路透社倫敦八日電稱英下院議員軍促英政府對日多加壓力，都可證明國際形勢繼續對我有利。</p>
<p>危機四發的日本</p>
<p>恰恰與我國內部團結國外多助的情勢相反，日本法西斯侵略者的內外危機則已進到更大的爆發的階段。僅從本週各報公開發表的消息，就可有到×方侵華軍事固然毫無勝利把握，所謂大舉總攻未能立卽實行，所謂政略進攻，亦以汪精衛的逃亡和吳佩孚的知守晚節而再度失敗。日本國內及國際危機，則愈趨嚴重。這裏可以特別舉出幾個証據：</p>
<p>兵源桔竭</p>
<p>自全面戰爭爆發，迄今年一月底止，×軍死傷至少已逾七十萬，在中國之×約有一百零二萬，計東北四十萬，華北中南共六十二萬，如×軍要繼續侵華，或對蘇聯作戰，則現在兵力顯屬不够，而國內所能調出的最多只有四十萬，且將使×有國內空虛之懼！</p>
<p>經濟危機</p>
<p>又自戰事發生到今年一月止，綜合各方統計，日軍費用至少已達八十八萬萬日圓，我軍則爲二十萬萬圓，我方費用僅等於日方的四分之一。今後戰事如果繼續，則我國消耗縱將增加，×方所增更將加倍，定於四月一日開始的日本下年度海陸軍費特別預算案，這幾天就要呈交議會核准。總計數額約達七十三萬萬日圓，其中陸軍軍費巳將由三十八萬二千一百萬增達五十四萬萬元，因此發生海陸軍爭奪軍費的衝突，而且這筆龍大預算，日本全國已無力量負担，破產危機，迫於眉睫。</p>
<p>反戰怒潮</p>
<p>日本人民，不備痛感此次戰爭僅爲少數獨占資本領袖及軍閱利益的戰爭，而且已在戰爭重負下瀕於絕境，因此反戰怒潮，奔騰澎湃，×軍大聲譁變，僞軍紛紛反正，僅據本週電訊卽可舉出無數例證：（一）中央社五日重慶電，上月廿一二日×軍三千在大沽譁變，結果被分兩批運往晉綏前綫。（二）同上六日屯溪電，日前江陰×兵五百餘反戰譁變，×司令被殺。（三）同上六日滬訊滬江南船所日籍工友百餘人反戰被捕。（四）同上七日淮陰電，江蘇僞軍徐衍昆率部千餘反正，北路李冠英南路劉福龍等僞部相率反正。（五）同上重慶九日電，漢口×軍成立廳大的反戰組織，實行大暴動，與日前天津暴動之×呼應，惜被偵悉，被捕爲首憲兵陸軍官兵等百餘名。（六）同上又電：×在華軍左傾思想日益高漲，各種秘密組織發甚速，日本某黨虹口支部已將反戰宣傳推進爲實際行動。（七）同上又電，日本國內反戰思想普遍發展，陸軍省亦有大批職員秘密參加，現已暴露的有軍部職員町尻與女明星田中氏之偷竊情報事件等多起。</p>
<p>革命運動</p>
<p>反戰反法西斯人民陣綫運動，在勢力微弱但工作緊張的日本共產黨領導之下，最近在日本國內已有激劇的發展，上面所舉，不過其中一二實例而已。爲日本人民自求解放，爲各民族的解放和世界和乎，日本人民大衆這種英勇鬥爭，和他們所遭過的艱險困苦，是値得大家感動與反省的！現在他們這種鬥爭並已展開到合灣朝鮮，和東北各地，中央社重慶三日電稱：合灣××志士潛回家鄉工作，及朝鮮全州工人一月廿八日起義，就是最新鮮的例子。</p>
<p>侵略陰謀</p>
<p>由此可知日×之不能再戰無力再戰！由此可知日×爲什麽要更加瘋狂實行轟炸屠殺，由此可知日×爲什麽要不惜威脅利誘的，在中國在國際收買叛黨匪徒，宣傳反共宣傳和平進行調解！事實已再明白不過：中國只有堅持團結抗戰到底，才能亦必能戰勝日×，獲得眞正和平，自由，與幸福。今日如果實行反共，實行議和，則不問此種運動是由漢奸親日份予發起，或由國內少數官僚政客主張，或有外國方面的誘脅，結果只會救濟了日本侵略者，只會寃枉了我們十九個月來的英勇鬥爭及慘重的犧牲，只會使中華民族日本民族永遠淪亡。只會使世界戰禍更加蔓延擴大！路透社九日重慶電所傳中國「政界人士」談述中國重申抗戰决心，而其中竟全宣稱「唯有召集類似二次華盛頓會議之遠東國際會議，方能解决現有中日圍突，一如果此訊果確。亦不能認爲我國當局的態度，更為中國人民所不能容認的！</p>
<p>加泰隆那的陷落</p>
<p>西班牙的巴薩龍納失陷以後，加泰隆那已經瀕於整個陷落的形勢了！加泰隆的陷落，不是由於西班牙政府軍的不能抗戰無力抗戰，不是由於西班牙全國人民不能抗戰無力抗戰，而是由於意德侵略者的肆無忌憚的援助叛軍大舉進攻，特別是由於英法統治者「不干涉」政策之一面縱容意德瘋狂進攻，一面阻止西班牙政府依法從外國購買軍需取得接濟，加泰隆那陷落以後，西班牙政府的處境固然更加困難，而法英兩國所受威脅則尤爲重大。因爲現在意德侵略者者可以在西班牙沿岸建立空軍根據地，用以截斷英法到菲洲殖民地的交通綫，並使英國的直布羅陀完全失去軍事價値。而且現在法國已處於意德侵略者的三面包圍之下，進而地中海的科西嘉固然形成意大利囊中之物，墨索里尼並已準備提出新的殖民地要求及控　蘇彝士運河。今後意德分道合作進一步威脅英法分割殖民地已屬無可避免！世界大戰總爆</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十日電】滬外訊、中立方面人士覜察、日軍佔領海南島、對於菲律賓將有重大之反響、因菲島原擬於實行獨立後、造成中立國之地位、海南島亦係由日法協定中保證其中立之地位者、今日軍竟大舉登岸、若日軍在海南島設海空軍根據地、則該地去菲島僅五百英里、對於菲律賓之安全、將爲一極大之威脅云、</p>
<p>【中央社重慶十日電】滬外訊、現在還東之各國海軍界人士、對於海南島問題之發展、正密切注硯中、此間各方認爲海南島有爲遠東一瑪育加島」之可能、（按瑪育加島爲地中海西班牙屬巴利牙爾羣島之一、與米諾加島同爲巴利牙爾羣島之重心、現在西叛軍手中、其爲意大利所控制、已非一日）、海軍界人士稱、海南島爲遠東軍事上極重要之海島、此非僅因該島距法國租借地廣州灣僅七十哩、距法屬安南僮一百六十哩、且因該島適置於星加披香港航綫之間、該島與台灣及日本委任統治地加羅林羣島、適成爲一半圓形、環繞菲列賓羣島之東西北三方、海南島有海口楡林港兩深水港、海口在海南島之北端、楡林港在海南島之南端、該島雖尙未完全開發、但將來可成爲極重要之海軍根據地、前一八九五年日俄戰爭時、帝俄波羅的海艦除調至日本海作戰、中途卽曾全部寄泊於海南海、峽、</p>

<p>【美聯社重慶十日電】此間官方、對日軍在海南島登陸事、幷不表示驚異、唯對此事在華南海面所引起之國際意義、則頗爲注意、中外一般人士認爲、（一）日軍佔領海南島、實爲對英美法華南利益之侵害、而並不直接有損於中國、因自廣州失陷後、該島之重要性已大減也、（二）因海南島位於安南東京灣附近、日軍之佔領該島、不論自海或空均爲對法國之威脅、（三）隔離法軍港廣州灣與安南之連繫、（四）造成日軍處於進攻巴賽島之有利地位、（五）危害菲島之前途、（六）遠反日法去年之協定云、</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十日電】東京外訊、據法學專家稱、在一八九七年三月間、中法政府會換正式文件、聲明中國政府、不將海南島讓與他國、一九〇七年日法代表又在巴黎簽訂協定、規定兩國應尊重中國之獨立與領土完整、同時對于中國領土與兩國鄰近之部份、兩國應互相保障該地之安全與和平、文中雖未明言海南、但其意卽係指明該地云、</p>
<p>英方將採堅決行動</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十日電】英官方對日軍在海南島登陸事、靜候續報、未加批評、（一）般以爲日方自去年六月間聲稱欲在該島登陸、此後已屢屢暗示、謂爲適應軍事需要、隨時均有登陸之可能此次固不足奇、唯日方雖屢言幷無久佔之意、但下院對之勢必反對、據信星期一議院質詢之結果、將令政府採取堅决行動、以履行去年六日間英法之共同警告云、</p>
<p>×外務省　欺人之談</p>
<p>【路透社東京十日電】日外務省發言人本日於招待記者席上宣稱、日本進攻海南島、完全屬軍事須要、决無意侵犯法日一九〇七年之協定云、</p>

<h3>世界動向一週間　（接第二版）</h3>
<p>發的危機已由英法僞善妥協的政策而更逼近了！至於西班牙政府軍雖然遭遇更大的危急，抗戰前途更加艱苦，但是他們還有其最後戰勝×人的可能。第一是因爲西班牙這次是戰略的撤退，它仍擁有五十萬精銳大軍，可以繼續抗戰。第二是西班牙仍擁有全國三分之一以上的廣大土地，可以做繼續抗戰的根據。第三是全西班牙人民，包括法西斯匪軍强佔地區的民衆，依然擁護民主政府。决心爲反對法西斯侵略而奮鬥。第四是全世界保衛和平民主的勢力，在蘇聯，在美國，在英法，以至在意德，正在用各種不同方式的鬥爭來實現「援助西班牙！」西政府並且斷然拒絕英法調停妥協，政府遷至華倫西亞繼續抗戰，打破了不久以前侵略者對於西國政府人民的無恥謠言，使英法亦不得不對意稍示强硬。我們倘使能够記憶從前貧乏的中國紅軍，苦守江西窮鄉，卒能抵抗不斷的大軍圍剿，就可相信：西班牙决非捷克，西班牙在以共產黨爲基幹的人民陣綫領導之下，一定會戰勝×人的。</p>
<p>英法美蘇的動態</p>
<p>英法</p>
<p>西班牙問題已經推進世界大戰危機到總爆發的著火點，歐洲菲洲美洲以至中日戰事，都不能不受到重大的影響。現在先看直接受到不利影響的英法兩國。依照過去西班牙抗戰發生後三十個月以來的事實，我們可以證明，英法統治階級，是一向同情西叛軍的，他們甚至還同情於意德侵略者在西班牙的暴行。他們根據本身金融資本的階級利益，一面實行不干涉政策，以爲旣可置身於戰過之外，並可阻止蘇聯援助西班牙政府，避免歐洲革命浪潮的高漲；一面縱容意德侵略者在西班牙的軍事行動，以爲意德征服西班牙以後，由於經濟困竭，勢必仰仗英法之力去實行建設，大可乘機獲利。現在英法急於調解西戰，便是想早點獲利。但是這將如何威脅到英法本身在歐洲的地位，甚至將脅使英國的歐亞交通不得不重繞好望角，這是每一個英法愛國人士所共見的。因此最近兩國人民大衆反對妥協外交反對法西斯的運動，已經如火如茶，一天熾烈一天，勢將成爲改變英法政策的主要力量。</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>其次，意德在西班牙的勝利，同時也威脅到南美各國的安全和美國的利益，因此這幾天美國朝野一致高呼着『援助西班牙』！『廢止中立法』！羅斯福總統公開號召援助民主國家，抵抗法西斯侵略，獲得蘇聯政府以對匈絕交作打擊侵略者的事實的響應，又獲得英首相法外長的先後響應，甚至侵略頭目墨索里尼在四日的演詞，亦秘不公佈了。美國這種反對侵略維護和平的政策，顯然是日德意侵略者瘋狂×行危害美國的結果，固然是美國民衆尤其是廣大努動大衆反法西斯反侵略運動的初步成功。</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>這種結果同時又帮助了和平的民主勢力的團結，特別是蘇聯政府得以順利推行維護和平及保陣民族獨立的政策。歐洲方面，蘇聯正在準備發起締結黑海公約，以黑海沿岸國家羅馬尼亞，土耳其，蘇聯等三國爲基礎，並邀約希臘參加，樹立集體安全制度，阻止德國再行東進。在遠東方面，蘇聯對日本侵略者的態度亦更趨强硬，一方面斷然拒絕日方關於海約的無理要求，一方面積極增强遠東戰備，特別値得注意的是本月六日七日，日軍進攻蘇聯黑龍江上游額爾古納河的二二七號島，卒遭蘇軍擊退，蘇聯已向日方嚴重抗議，日僞蘇邊形勢又趨緊張。蘇聯在遠東威力的發揚，不僅爲我國率制了濘延數千里的日本防軍，同時也將爲英法美國打舉。本南進西犯的計劃，可見『截聯爲世界和平柱石』，絕非一句口號！不能實現的幻想。</p>

<h3>如何克服目前的困難</h3>
<p>……對旅外僑胞的期望……</p>
<p>【救亡社稿】在五屆五中全會開會的那一天，我們的最高領袖，在開會詞中對于抗戰的全般局勢，對我們作了一個極精當的分析。領袖昭示我們，要「認識自己，認淸×人，認識環境與事物發展之必然性，卽可曉然于成敗勝負之數」。×之必敗，與我之必勝，這情勢已經是確定了；但是我們要爭取光榮的最後勝利，這過程中也還橫亙着許多的困難。所以領袖說：「一，以我們的統一，團結，對付×人的驕妄，凌亂，以下尅上；二，發揮我們農業國家之特畏節約，堅持加深×人工業國家的弱點；三，利用我們天時地利的優點，加緊戰時一切建設，促起×國社會崩潰的危機；四，眞實力行三民主義，打倒×人黷武主義」。</p>
<p>一年以來，國內的團結，達到了××夢想不到的程度，×人的一切挑撥離間，都失敗了，全國軍民在蔣委員長的領導之下，精誠團結，爲實現三民主義的新中國而鬥爭，這團結因戰爭的轉入新的階段，而更加强化，這是祗要一看最近軍事，政治，經濟，文化各方面的力量的急速的强化，就可以知到的了。光榮的勝利，就在明天，這是我們可以以歡愉振奮的心情報吿給旅居海外艱苦奮鬥的同胞們的。</p>
<p>但是我們一方面固然要認淸×人的困難，來堅定我們必勝的信心，但同時，也要認淸自己還存在着困難，用一切可能的努力來克服。</p>
<p>×人目前所有的困難，正如領袖在五中全曾開會詞中所說，是無法可以克服的了。而我們的困難呢，都完全繫于我們是否有抗戰必勝的信念，和是否肯犧牲個人來克服這些困難的一念。因爲我們的困難，都是享受上的困難，而且是一時性的。委員長對這一點指示得非常淸楚，說我們要「發揮我們農業國家的特長節約，來加深×人工業國家的弱點。」他並曾更具體地說過，我們前方的人，要以士兵的生活爲標準，後方的人，要以老百姓的生活的標準，這是在個人生活上每個愛國同胞，都該奉行唯謹的信條。</p>
<p>我們是產業後進的國家，抗戰以來，我們把好些重要海口和城市失掉了，也失掉了好些交通路線，在人民生沽上，自然感覺許多不便。但是這些個人生活上的不便，正是促進國家進步的原因，海口失掉，我們可以脫離外來貨物的羈絆，而使內地的新舊產業，處在無競爭的保護狀態之下，中國目前正是脫掉××經濟的一個千載難逢的機會。</p>
<p>在國內，爲着抗戰的勝利，不論在前方在後方，都在厲行着節約運動，都已經切實地執行了降低生活的信條。對于不奉行這種信條，恣肆放縱的人，也定下了嚴厲處置的規律。我們相信在這聖戰的鐵火鍛鍊中間，一定能够把我們民族從來所有的一切不良習性，完全燒毀！</p>
<p>現在，我們不禁想起了在海外爲國奮鬥着的僑胞，我國僑胞的刻苦耐勞，撙節好義。那是世界周知的事情，所以在降低生活，實行節約之點，僑胞們是我們國內同胞的先覺。但是在最近上自從抗戰以來，在香港，在上海租界，在別一些地方，據說也變相地出現了一種奢糜的風氣，對這一點，我們在此傳達一下國內的消息。希望大多數艱苦奮鬥的同肥，能够喚起居留地的少數習于享受生活的僑胞們的注意，自肅自檢一下，把有用的金和物品節約下來，以供持久××及增加生產之用。委員長所說的「利用我們天時地利的優點，加緊戰時一切建設』，我們希望僑胞見義勇爲地，把這責任担負起來。</p>
<p>這篇短文和海外僑胞相見的時候，也許正是廢曆的新年，我們謹將祖國欣欣向榮，愈戰愈强的實况傳達給大家，作爲新年的喜訊，同時，我們希望備胞們在困難的新年中。儘可能地節約，用于無謂的金錢省下來，慰勞前線將士，後方把的傷兵，作爲你們對于他們的新年的禮品。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>愛護人材！</h3>
<p>爲爭中華民族澈底解放，沒有一個中華兒女應該被遺棄在抗戰建國事業以外的！更沒有一個專門人材應該被遺棄在抗戰建國事業以外的，本報重慶十日專電稱政治部長陳誠函敎部轉令全國專科以上學校，對畢業生如尙無職業，可准其投考國民軍訓敎官，並免一切手續云云。陳將軍此令，可爲當局愛護人材的重大表示，我們應該雙手擁護。</p>
<p>但我們仍舊不能指出：抗戰十九個月以來，我國政治雖有長足進步，各方專門人才亦迭蒙政府給予發揮所長的機會，最高領袖對此之努力倡導、尤屬令人感動，然而中層下層領袖，則仍有未能忠實執行者。因此，腐敗無能之輩，守舊頑固份子，以及夤緣時會的投機者，仍得濫竽當道，而富於愛國心責任心及民族意議的靑年，具有豐富經驗學識及高尙人格的專家，對抗戰有决心在羣衆有威信的人才，仍多閒散棄置，甚或顚沛流離，思盡其國民天職而不可得：其他長材埋沒於瑣細工作，壢垂紳于廟堂之上等不平現衆，尤屬所在皆有。在此民族運命轉捩時期，誠望當局百尺竿頭，更進一步，芟盡封建殘壘，嚴禁黨派成見，務使全國人才，各得所事而盡其能，同時並望感喟於懷材不遇之士，勿冉孤傲自賞，遺世尤人，使有爲國家民挨献身機會，而能發揮所長者，尤當踴躍以赴，爲衆表率。</p>
<p>最後我們應知民族解放事業，至今方露一綫曙色，前途艱險困苦，或有非我們意計所及；盡集全國人才，尤慮不足應付未來艱巨事業；故對於若干地方以黨派成見而迫害有爲肯年，及少數人士依個人偏見而動以反共爲詞以啓內部分裂的，尤常及時妥爲禁絕，否則就大遠當局愛護人材共卦國難以救國族的偉大意旨了！</p>
<h3>「最精彩節目」</h3>
<p>本港ZKW播音台，前夜接播倫敦傳來的西班牙「內戰一消息，步伐兵車，隱約可聞，據稱居民由收音機得聆此消息的，都認爲本港有電台以來最精彩的節目。我們希望今後聽到這種最精彩節目的人士，應該抽出幾分鐘的時間來：</p>
<p>（一）想一想：西班牙民主政府及其人民，是怎樣在爲祖國自由與世界和平而戰？他們是會樣的在意德侵略魔軍的蹂躪屠殺，與在懦弱的民主國家偽善出賣之下，爲我們抵抗並削弱日本侵略的帮助者？</p>
<p>（二）聽到千萬里外的西戰播音，更應該想一想：近在我們身邊數十百里地方，正演出着日本××其侵略我祖國的戰爭，被蹂躪被殺害的，正是我們的田園廬舍，正是我們的父老親友！</p>
<p>舊曆的新年快又到了，不要讓炮竹嬉笑淫褻的聲浪，掩蓋了這些精彩的節目！不要議自己喪失去一個最好的祝福的機會！我們要用献金，用捐輸，甩參加一元還債運動，用參加救濟傷兵難民運動，來祝福我們祖國與西方戰友們的康健與勝利！</p>

<h3>節約獻金集體旅行　用新方式過舊歷年　華商總會業餘聯誼社等紛紛倡導</h3>
<p>— 寄卓</p>
<p>臘鼓頻催，舊曆新年轉瞬卽屆。雖然這「　曆」巳經不是我們的「國暦」，可是，根深蒂固的風俗習慣，却不是一朝一夕所能遽爾變其舊觀。——這是不容否認的事實。</p>
<p>舊曆新年在香港，據說風俗習慣的繁文縟節，勞民傷財是登峯造極，爲各地所不能與之比美。假如天下太平，社會景氣，勞碌了一年，來一次狂歡，這個倒是人情之常，未可厚非。可是，今次的元旦，却是在烽火漫天，哀鴻遍地中降臨人間，我們仍忍心因襲風尙，白白燒了整個除夕的爆竹，任意糟蹋寶貴的財物否？這個是十分値得我們仔細反省的嚴重間題。</p>
<p>假如不是盲子的話，當可以看見香港突增的八十萬同胞是怎樣來的；假如不是聾子的話，當可以聽到祖國半壁河山淪陷之後，我們的同胞是過着怎麼樣的一種生活；假如有思想的話，亦當可以明瞭我們的痛苦是誰賜的了。在目前這個嚴重的厄運中，看看遭難的同胞，想想自己的禾來，誰能忍心，縱情逸樂，一如往昔呢？</p>
<p>照例，在舊曆年中要驅除「邪鬼」的糾纏，禱祝「神明」的保佑。血一般的敎訓，我們已經警覺到最大的邪鬼就是日本軍閥；眞正能够保佑我們的，就只有國家！這個觀念化的理論，自從廣州失陷之後，香港的僑胞是十二萬分親切的體驗到了。在元旦吉日所互相祝福的吉利話，亦絕對只有等到抗戰勝利才能俗兌現，而絲　不能有所僥悻。</p>
<p>針對着這個事實，本港華商總會發動推行農曆新年節約運動，分明是十二分有意義的當前急務。聞該會已擬就小啓及辦法，以請帖形式印就，分送各行各商號一致推行。其要點爲：夏曆新年節約運動日期由戊寅年十二月二十日起至己卯年元月十六日止。節省欵項用途完全用於救濟兵災難民，交款日期至元月十六日止。該種簡帖，用粉紅色印刷，除刊小啓及辦法外，並開列節約種類，由節約者自行塡寫。</p>
<p>凡是稍具血性的同胞，聽了這個消息之後，無不深表欣慰之忱，而禱祝其如火如茶地擴大起來。</p>
<p>這是一個可喜可慰的情報，昨天記者晤見杳港業餘聯誼社王君恒先生的時候，得悉業餘聯誼社亦嚮應這個節約運動，並提出辦法，貢献給華商總會採納。爲使這個運動普遍於香港的每一個角落起見，該社還進行與記者公會，靑年記者學會，靑年會。婦女會等團體共同負起推動的任務。該社對於此事的意見，日間將有文吿發表。這自然是誰亦樂於舉手贊成，齊聲叫好而無懷裝的。</p>
<p>王先生還很熱情地語記者：在舊曆年中，大家都是休假而沒有正當的消遣，不是無聊，納悶，就要爲不正當的娛樂所引誘。因此，該社擬在舊曆年中，舉行集體旅行。一方面可以在美麗的大自然中享受游目騁懷的樂趣，亦可以藉此難得機會，聯絡社員的　情。還有一個更重要的任務，就是發　討論如何節約献金的座談。——活潑而嚴肅，自然是今日所需要的集體生活。</p>
<p>該社是本港各行職業份子所組織的健全團體，與該社同性質之姊妹組織一—香港銀行界業餘聯誼會亦有同樣的行動。將來的影嚮，料必有良好的効果可以預期。</p>
<p>又聞記者公會亦擬於舊曆元旦舉行集體旅行，過過有意義而需要提倡的集體生活。</p>
<p>再聞集木，疋頭，洋貨等商行，亦響應華商總會之建議，决首先將春茗貨省却，本港婦女乒災籌賑會庶務主任梁培夫人，最近又將其夫梁培先生壽辰費用節省，捐出國幣一千元，匯交兵災會散賑，又該會昨又收到太古西倉職工預節新春費用國幣一百元，陳新義賣溢利港幣卅元，華安辦館麵粉十九包，節約救國，頗有風起雲湧之勢。</p>
<p>來吧！放大眼光來推進這個運動吧！只須我們本着良心，量力節約，傷兵，難民，國家民族，就得到不少的實利了！從此轉變國際友人的觀感，亦是增加我們生活在香港的一點體面。來吧！推進這個運動是香港的僑胞責無旁貸的任務。我們都是中國人，別再昏迷！起來吧！親愛的同胞！</p>

<h3>救濟流亡學生　全國青年協會幹事黃秀璣女士會見記</h3>
<p>— 喬人</p>
<p>毒燄侵到每一塊地方，老百姓飽嘗了顚沛流離之苦，吃的沒有，住的沒有，甚而每一個人的事業都遭受破壞，開始了他們流浪逃亡的生活。但是祖國正爲了抗拒，無理的侵略而鬥爭着，已堅决的準備，只要達到自由解放的目的，不避任何艱難困苦，也要支持長久的抗戰，流亡的人們流浪到什麼時候呢，逃亡到什麼地方呢？我們實在不能再流浪，我們實在不能再逃亡，我們每一個人，祖國需要我們！尤其是無數由戰區流亡到各地的學生，荒棄了他們的學業，對於國家的基礎簡直是一大損失！</p>
<p>全國基督敎男女靑年協會學生部，爲救濟這輩失學的靑年，特別組織了全國學生救濟會，得學生互助會及遠東學生救濟會的熱烈同情，把這些救濟的事務，推行到各地，經費方面，也得國內外的熱心人士捐助，得順利進行；在各地成立地方委員會。香港方面，由全國基督敎靑年會特派學生部幹事黃秀譏女士担任。黃女士抵港，已經許久，對於救濟流亡學生的工作，也已辦得有相當成績。記者聽得黃女士快要離開香港了，昨天特地訪謁她一次，同時群詢她關於救濟流亡學生進行的近况。</p>
<p>記者在女靑年會的客堂會見了黃女士，她的樸素無華的衣裳，和靄可親的態度，給予我的印象是大時代女性的典型。道達了來意後，黃女士給我詳述救濟流亡學生的進行。</p>
<p>「自從華南戰事發生，廣州不幸失守後，內地的學生逃亡到香港來的很多，因此救濟流亡學生在杳港也就是急不容緩的工作。總會對於這種工作的推行，已遍及上海，北平，武漢，西安，長沙，成都，重慶，昆明，貴陽等地，都已設立地方委員會。我是奉總會的委滇，到香港來，聯同男女靑年會，和熱心學生事業的領袖，組織香港救濟學生委員會，專事辦理這種工作。很多謝報界先生的帮忙，對於這事很努力宣傳，使工作的推行，非常順利。目前在香港，救濟流亡學生事務，可說已有了意外的成功。現在已登記的學生，已經有二百多名，第一批請求津貼路費入內地求學的申請書，審核通過的有百二十餘人，陸續登記的尚多。</p>
<p>「對于這些流亡的生的救濟辦法，大槪有六項：（一）貸欵，（二）學費津貼，（三）設學生寄宿金，（四）路費津貼，（五）特殊訓練班，（六）工作介紹，看他們的環境情形怎樣，才决定採取什麼方法救濟，大概在香港登記的學生，大部願意囘到內地求學的，所以請求第四項救濟辦法的最多，許世英先生說得好：歷史吿訴我們，每當亂世之中，常有大思想家，或文學家出現。只要我們能够在艱難困苦中，更努力去尋求學問，前途終是光明的。所以我們要把許多流亡的學生帶回祖國去，使他們對祖國更親切，更容易得到報國的機會」。</p>
<p>最後黃女士吿訴記者，她已决定今天（卽昨天）下午離開香港到內地去繼續辦理救濟工作。她的行程是乘廣東輪先到海防，然後轉到桂林。昆顯，，陽各地，同時對於由港囘到內地的流亡學生的安置問題，也將和當地的敎育當局加以詳細的洽商。因爲黃女士忙於旅程的準備，記者也就跟她吿別了。</p>

<p>交通旅行</p>
<h3>從汕頭到西貢（一）</h3>
<p>— 華游</p>
<p>客行的黑幕</p>
<p>假如你曾留心看過汕頭報的話，那末你就明瞭到近一年來汕頭各客行如何操縱新加坡船票了。到安南的船票，在中日戰事未發生之前，每名只須十幾元（大艙票）汕幣就可以買得到。戰事勃發之後，潮屬各地富家和無知壯丁多規避徵召，所以到南洋受外國人糟場的人特別多起來。往新加坡暹羅等地非三四百元不來，普通的家庭，那裏籌得出這麼多的路費　？無已，只有跑到安南去。安南雖然有入口稅，人頭稅，合起來不過三四十元越幣，連路費也不能超出八十元（一國幣）。當然要比往新加坡暹羅等地便宜得多呵　因此往越南的三隻輪船！太平洋，鯉門，大中華，每次總是像運猪（據鯉門輪一位買辦吿訴我，每當輪船靠近西貢河岸時，××××局的××××總免不了向船主發問：「此次運來多少猪」？）一般裝得飽載而去。汕頭各客棧（吳順興客行除外）平時想在往新加坡那些旅客身上攫取一筆厚利的，至此不得不轉移了方針，在這些往安南的人們的身上敲剝起來。現在就把我當時親受剝削的經過寫在這裏，以供潮汕一般前往該地者，知所趨避。</p>
<p>我因爲六年來未嘗再到安南去，所以一切感到生疏來。尤其是抗戰後前往安南的船票如何昇漲，都是覺得異常陌生的。這次去安南，是在潮安城猷巷某某號（姑隱其名）購買船票，初時去問他們，據說每名國幣二十七元，但隔天却看他手裏拿來一封由汕頭榮隆街某某客行（他們的聯號）打來的電報，說什麼客多呀，船票漲至三十元呀！自已雖不是什麼奸商市儈，倒也明白到商場間有所謂「早晚市價不同」的事情，所以也就誤認他們有所謂早晚票價，不假思索地向他們定了兩張船票。</p>
<p>潮汕自七月二日同時受了×機轟炸之後，潮汕鐵路火車也把行車的時間表改爲早晚兩次。我們是在七月十七日乘夜車到汕頭去，因爲當天黃昏時候汕頭發出空襲警報，我們在彩塘車站，足足等了一個多鐘頭才能俗往南開。到了汕頭車站在幾盞大光燈輝映之下，看到月初受×機摧殘後遺留的頹垣殘壁，不禁爲之吁然長嘆！當坐人力車趨入市區時，看見整個汕市葬入黑曙的夜神的　口裏，不禁令人回憶到未蒙×機摧殘之前的汕頭，萬炬的電燈光。映照得整個汕頭市如何美麗可愛呵！又想到今夜我們夫婦踏上黑暗之鄉，準備流亡到海外去，更痛恨到×人之慘無人道來！</p>
<p>進了客棧之後，一切都給人以不愉快—他們的房間與他們的舖床，都和他們的人格一般骯髒，令人作三日嘔！我們只好把行李暫時屈寄在那裏，乘車到華僑旅店　開房間去。</p>
<p>旅館的生意蕭條得十分可憐！這樣眞使我們感到很難得的淸幽，因爲沒有電燈，房間只有一技三寸來長筆　般穴的白洋濁和一盞豆般光的煤油燈，所幸的是地方幽靜和床褥的整潔，這給與我們這行將流亡到　外的一對行旅者不少的慰安，說到代價，房租連小費在內，只是一塊多錢，這就不能不說格外便宜呵！</p>
<p>一早起來，兩輛人力車在旅館門口等着我們了——這是昨夜預先吿訴他們的。洋車過處，一切的商店門戶是緊閉着，當你細心注視時，這才發現許多舖門是請了鐵將軍把守着。沿　站崗的警察，不時地對着洋車夫盤問：「你們爲什麼不到中山公園受訓？」洋車夫的回答是：「我們拉完了這生意就去。」據洋車夫的話訴才知道今天是汕市訓練洋車夫的第一天。聽完他們的說話，方慶幸到昨夜預呌他們來旅館門口等候，不然的話，今晨起來正不知如何到達了得合興的客棧，像自己對於汕市的街道是如此的陌生。</p>
<p>到客棧之後就開始辦理出國的手續。所謂手續就是塡寫出國志願書。這種手續，我不敢說它不對，不過辦理不妥善時，就變成擾害僑民。如志願書上所貼的半身四寸像片，我們本來可以自由到無論那一家攝影館照去，只要面貌相符就好。然而汕頭各客棧　規定攝影費由他們收，隨便帶我們在十字街頭那種隨攝隨晒的快鏡照出一幅像片來，收費竟是六毫國幣。此外如種痘費，汕頭海關險疫所是收二元汕幣，合國幣八毫多錢，（從前是免費）客棧不知憑什麼加收兩毛叫做什麼手續費來。出國志願書塡完後一，照例客棧專的夥計會勸你不要到僑務局問話，他們說只花兩塊錢就可以省却這種麻煩的手續，可惜自家不是販賣人口的歹人，用不着掏出這兩塊錢。寫到這裏實在敎人痛心！僑務局之設立，本來是杜防歹徒販賣人口或者拐逃人家婦女而設立的，其意至善！不意竟也成爲給人利用賺綫的門徑。有了兩塊錢就可以帶一個婦女出口，這眞連一隻猪　的價格也不及了！</p>
<p>我們堅持到僑務局去問話，客棧裏的人總是想出種種的話來騙你，不是說泊在嶼外×艦的水上機已起飛，就是說澄海那事已發出空襲警報，務必騙你　出兩塊錢交給他們而後已。無奈，們抱着寧可給×機炸死不寃花這兩塊錢的决心，前往市政府，這樣客棧裏才派一個夥計尾追我們而來。他們所以派出這個夥計，並不是前來帮你的忙，而是來囑咐你：「當過堂時問話官如問你們的船票買多少錢時，請你們吿訴他二十四元。」我聽完他這稀囑咐之後，眞是憤恨之至！因爲船票給他們代理，每名國幣三十元（有的竟給他們敲到將近四十元）。巳給他們拿去了，要待吿發，這樣自然要誤了行期。一方面也是問話者只問你多少歲就叫你出去，這樣也就給客棧佔了便宜。當天下船之後，探問太平洋的買辦，才知道他們的公司規定每票售二十元，市府明令各客棧代售票價不能超過二十四元。他們乃竟任意敲剝，實屬罪無可逭經—船起錯之後，多方探問，住汕市吳順興客行的旅客却是一律售二十四元，遭眞是令人感到那家客行的主事人難能可貴！一般客行皆抱「乘火打刧」，他們却能够拿出良心來，這父何怪乎他們生意佔汕市各客棧百分分之六十呢！</p>
<p>我雖未嘗住過吳順興客行，但我却替他們盡了不少次的義務宣傳，凡有旅客來　西買越南之間，我一定介紹他們到吳順興買船票去！這意思就是「得道者多助」！你「乘火打刦」的一般客棧老板呀，你們也知道到「失道者寡助」的道理嗎？</p>
<p>從汕頭到西買，航行九十六小時，二十二日午後五時在細雨濛濛中船就靠在八號碼頭。（一共十二個碼頭）但是不能上岸，因爲海關的辦事人員已經停止辦公了，這樣大家又得在船裏多睡一夜。黃昏的時候，岸上的人不斷地在那裏攢動，看看是否有了他們的親朋南來，有的買了麵包臘腸往船裏投，（因爲在警察嚴密監視之下，前來探詢親朋的人，都不能站近船邊。）看見人家吃着麵包，自己眞有幾分垂涎起來，可惜自己事前並未來信通知家人，不然的話，在岸上攢動着的人，也有自家的弟妹雜在其間呵！</p>

<h3>閩北游程（三）</h3>
<p>— 王啓熙記</p>
<p>延平舊爲府名，唐置軍，宋改南劍州南浦郡，元改延平路，明爲府，屬福建，淸因之，民國廢，今南平其舊治也。境極險固，與邵武府相倚，諺稱一銅延平，鐵邵武縣謂可堅守也。南平傍山臨溪，更有天險，現民泉多在山壁上開築防空壕，頗似古代穴居民族。此間有名勝爲翠閣，中奉佛像建築甚精　，有石溪幾百步，豋高可望見劍溪，風景甚佳。</p>
<p>第九日　南平至福州</p>
<p>早七時即附小輪沿劍溪下，南平距福州約四百二十華里下水順流十小時　達，上水須二十餘小時，溪中多暗礁，夜間不能行駛，故上水需時兩日。</p>
<p>是　天雨溪流如滾，兩岸多山，而溪中又多灘，回首見逆水上駛之民船，水深處則張帆慢行，　急處則拔纜而上，聞一天只行五六十里，舟子　衣竹笠涉水泛舟，間有礁石從溪中突出如　　成羣，冒雨尋魚，風景天然，富有畫意。</p>
<p>沿途經下道，吉溪，斜溪，胡蘆山，岳溪，太平，尤溪口，樟湖坂而至三都口。此處爲一小村，住民百餘戶，村上駐有水警隊，故上流輪船，皆在此過夜，而下水輪船，則停留後卽開。</p>
<p>再過經黃田而至谷口，是爲古田縣管轄，福州到此，有小火輪直達。再下則爲彎口。又二十里爲水口，達二重鎭，有住戶及商店數百家，蓋上流運下之木材多先泊此處再行轉蓮福州也。</p>
<p>水口以下爲大仁，宏鎮溪，大若，小若，而　閩淸口往閩淸者由此分路。此去灘流漸平，經上溪口，觀音歧，下岐，源口，金鐘閣，白沙，竹崎，而至候官市，兩岸多橄欖龍眼荔枝等果樹。雨中靑翠，更見美觀時近黃昏，遠望兩岸人家，已炊烟四縷矣。</p>
<p>夜七時至洪山橋，已萬家燈火，所謂「洪橋夜泊」者，吾人己親歷其境。此處設有關卡水警，檢查之後，城內遊客皆由此上岸。小火輪繼續前駛，經三縣而停於籠潭角對江之南台島。吾與趙君於是時雇車回橋南之倉山，旬日遊程，於此結束矣。</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>埠際賽之重要情報　華聯隊昨已選出　菲隊中不少名將實力相當強勁　港選隊下星期三與軍聯再練賽</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）最近本港一輩足球迷、莫不注意於港菲埠際賽之事、星期四日參觀選隊與聯隊對賽練習之爭先恐後情形、以及昨日中西人士分向强華體育用具公司與謀得利琴行預購入塲券之擠擁、在在均可證足球入人之深爲何許也、筆者昨費一日奔走之力向各方面調查、知港菲雙方對此重要賽會之籌備、截至昨日止、已算功德圓滿、茲分別記各種情報如次、</p>
<p>華聯昨已選出</p>
<p>若照我輩華人心理而論、則對華聯隊之人選如何、實與選手隊之能滿人意否同其重視、莫不渴欲早知其陣容者也、茲査悉各會代表、昨曾在羅文錦律師寫字樓開會討論、結果選出之人物、大滿人意、堪稱今港中之標準華聯隊伍、名單如下、</p>
<p>譚均幹（南華華）</p>
<p>李天生（南華南）　麥紹漢（南華南）</p>
<p>許竟成（東方會）　梁榮照（南華南）　宋靈聖（東方會）</p>
<p>侯澄滔（東方會）　黎兆榮（南華華）　李惠堂（南華會）　馮景祥（南華南）　鄧廣森（南華南）</p>
<p>（後備員）侯榕生（光華）劉慶才（南華南）陳德輝（南華華）楊水益（南華華）</p>
<p>菲隊不少能員</p>
<p>昨據菲律濱方面致本港足球總會電文、稱此次菲島球迷、因聞港方有名將李惠堂吿山奴復出、已有殷商多人準備合租一輪船、專意來港觀熱鬧、幷請足球總會爲彼輩預留頭等座位一百五十個、同時幷聲明昨巳决選　五人、由義務敎練嘉爾禾率領來港、準十四號早乘俄國皇后輪鉛抵步、球員名單如下</p>
<p>堯俄（喇沙學院）　韋蘭奴華（烈地倫隊）</p>
<p>M摩蘭打（喇沙學院）　香那他斯（湯馬斯大學）　巴威髙（烈地倫隊）</p>
<p>華理斯（喇沙學院）　姚吉地（喇沙學院）　嘉巴拉斯（YCO隊）　臬都（YCO隊）</p>
<p>必治（YCL隊）　鮑賽利（YCL隊）　丁摩蘭（全菲代表）　望狹斯（烈地倫隊）　夏利地亞（喇沙學院）　利也斯（喇沙學院）</p>
<p>査此十五員大漢、俱爲菲島之著各球員、守門員堯俄、身高五尺十寸半、四年來均被選爲全菲代表、有鐵門之稱、左內衞E摩蘭打少年英俊、步武敏捷、云爲菲島自有足球史以來之最佳內衛、止前衞姚吉地善作第三內衛戰術、左前衛華理斯有氣袋之稱、左內鋒鮑賽利係法國人、前本上海法商隊健將、每被選作埠際代表、善盤　、藝甚老到、其他更不少爲曾出席遠東運動會之名將、聞菲島方面、視今之人激、爲數年來代表隊之最佳者云、</p>
<p>選隊二次練習</p>
<p>自星期四日一度試賽、正選隊竟因缺乏聯絡力而卒不能勝拉集成軍之港聯隊後、一時輿論吿表示不滿、卽足球總會中人亦深恐該隊如不從聯絡上着想、當難有勝一希望、昨遂議定决使正選隊於下星期三日再作一次練習賽、並約定海陸軍方面派强有力之聯隊與賽、藉以檢閱實力、聞海陸軍方面已答應到時派隊出塲、比賽地點仍在鉚鑼灣海軍球塲、準下午五時開賽、入塲券仍一律僅收二毫、理事者因鑒於前日觀衆之擁擠情形、已决定到時準下午四點鐘即開始開放四個門戶賣票云、（球塲舊侶）</p>
<h3>特別艮牌糊塗賬　南華南三打九龍　乙丙組亦各有一幕重要戰事</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】大好春節、球事特多、居在這個「世外桃源』裏的一般迷民、寧可理亂不知、黜陟不聞、但對於球事、則特別關懷、</p>
<p>今犬足球、又是一個好節目、特別銀牌和聯賽、都有舉行、而其中最顚倒球國衆生的一幕、則爲南華南三打九龍會、此乃銀牌複賽、兩隊前經兩次苦戰、猶未分髙下、遂有今天第三次算賬、以决雌雄、</p>
<p>九能會　心勃勃、實想打倒南華、前大埠際練習賽、　隊球員　烈之、佐芝、　亞臣三人、）原港聯代表、但他們自私心　、竟不出爲港聯効力，祇準備與南華决戰、想來此種自私行爲、有玷體育道德、然其對今天一投之　勝心切、則昭然若揭了、</p>
<p>該隊又鑑於第二次交鋒、培爾任中鋒、演出不佳、領導無方、今天特調申都氏替代厥職、加以其全體球員有充份準備、立下不勝不休之心、希望南華諸子、好自振作、切莫使宵小得志、</p>
<p>聽說南華的陣綫、亦有變動、守門一職、决用張榮才、榮才在征貢時、有極好的表演、南華中人、對他深具信任心、故今天用他以代包家平、絕不成問題、惟有一個很令人覺得詫異的消息、則是前綫方面、將捨羅斗文、而用那位因足部受傷久未參與戊行之張滿榮、出任左翼、若此說是眞、確買莫測髙深了、</p>
<p>記者從別方而探悉、南蘇打算捨羅用張、乃出諸足球部某委員意思、因此公不滿斗文邇來演出退化、又以他很懶練習、而對於郭英祺、亦有同樣的不滿、或用李恩樑代充左內鋒、</p>
<p>臨大戰而內部多變、定不是好兆、望足球部諸公、在此生死關頭的重要賽中、不可操諸過當、</p>
<p>多數人的推測、南華勝利希望較髙、記者亦云然、不過、我總不愁南華防衛不堅、祇愁進攻不力、因爲前線祗有『獨沽一味』的短傳術、若發揮得好、定可取勝、否則恐難收效、而且九龍會諸守將、對南華此種戰略、能作有效的擊破、竊以爲、用華前線的短傳、固不能不用、最好復多利用兩翼抽來、若此則準决賽權當爲南華听有了、</p>
<p>乙組銀牌則爲準决賽、西工程對米杜息、亦够刺激的一幕、且看誰勝、便得决賽權、</p>
<p>丙想决賽、去週士葛已勝飛機一次、如今天士葛冉勝、便獲錦　、</p>
<p>甲組聯軍土葛對香港會、勝負不關大局、亦料士葛可奪二分而歸、錄南華及九龍會兩陣如下、（球塲太歲）</p>

<p>內容是叙述一個鄉下女郞到大城市、找尋未婚夫、大鬧笑話、後來還怎樣的和一個作家及此作家著作的發行人、在特殃的形境之下、發生了一段癲狂胡鬧的戀愛故事，</p>
<p>本片抓住了現代市生都活之一片段加以發揮、表現得非常明快、導演RichardThorpe對於喜劇的處理、有極豐富的經驗、不但把全片勾劃了一個諧趣無比的風格、同時每一鏡頭、也都充滿濃厚的　諧的情趣、每一寸膠片的放映、都使觀衆沒有停笑的機會、珍納姬娜在片中演飾村姑、表現出一種極可愛的性格、她把一個鄉下女子純潔和平的衷懷、和對都市朋友不甚信任的態度、刻割得維妙維肖、是片中最出色的人物、餘如分飾作家與發行家之羅拔孟甘穆利和法蘭曹通、也有極美妙優秀的演作、此部影片、可說是他們三星第一次的合作與成功的作品、</p>
<p>皇后平安　同映……春心綺念</p>
<p>Youth　Takes　A　Fling</p>
<p>片中描寫一個癡情女店員、追求她所夢想的人、而不幸那男子却有些獃氣、除了醉心航海事業之外、沒一件事物値得他的注意、女人當然也不能例外、就是多情嬌麗如那女店員、對他所献的慇勤、也絲毫得不到他的歡心、末了還决然的想遠避她的糾纏、但暈浪的痛苦、打破了他航海的迷夢、也醫好了他無情的毛病、</p>
<p>本片雖則儘可能的以各種場面、如時裝表演、公共游泳塲等鏡頭、來充實內容、但尙未能完全掩飾本片內容空虛的缺點，演員方面、安特麗烈絲尙有旖旎動人的演作、至於飾那醉心航海的靑年的佐麥克利、雖則他對性於格的表現、太爲路張一點、但他却是片中自始至終趣味的中心人物、</p>

<p>故事如此、一望而知是一個喜劇、傑美杜侖、瓊黛維斯是招笑的中心人物、播昔明星佛萊特亞倫也很冷雋有趣、</p>
<p>新世界　續七朶鮮玫</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>上集七朶鮮玫瑰中說到馬陋芬與林妹妹結婚爲止、這裏從林產子以至馬林二人、感情不佳、同時再述馮峯與許曼麗結合後、以因感情不佳而致發生衝突、各走極端、再述馬陋芬巧遇許曼麗、兩人發生戀愛、爲老夫婦發覺、述明馬許原爲未婚夫妻、於是雙方覺悟、馬更遠遁、結果爲子所感、仍回家中、與林愛好如初、</p>
<p>爲了迎合低級觀衆、劇情牽强不堪、演技亦不佳、陳舊的作法使觀衆們討厭、</p>
<p>中央……夢遊仙境瑰</p>

<p>全劇自始至終、散漫異常、劇情全無中心點、我相信進步的觀衆、必不會歡迎這樣的片子，唱的曲還是幾支舊曲、</p>
<p>利舞臺高陞　同映…花木蘭</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個現代的女子、因爲曾經演出過舞台上的「花木蘭』、因此她時時想做一做現代的「花木蘭』、果然在國難嚴重的時候、她實現了她的志願、原因是她發現了一個組織很有規律的漢奸機關、於是就和她的情人鄺山笑、共同設法破此秘密機關、盜取文件、不知道經了多少的困難、他們總於達到了目的、連伶俐志昏的漢奸們、也被他們偉大的精神所感化了、共同出發到前線去、</p>

<h3>對於兒童體格鍜錬應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>對於兒童嚴格的鍛錬為父母者應負最大的責任。父母　不僅須負指導的責任、也要以身作則、對于健康和這種運動須有深切研究、並須細心觀察這種運動對於兒童身體的影嚮和各人不同的反應。在家庭中、對於兒童的鍛鍊、無論如何不能應用強迫的方法、最有效的方法就是誘導和以身作則。倘若爲父母者能以身作則、此種思想不難深入他們兒童的腦海中、於是就能啓發他們的好奇心和興趣、</p>
<p>凡從事任何事業、始的時候最感困難、在啓發了與趣之後、我們還要注意怎樣使他們渡過困難、維持他們的與趣、從事徒手體操和器械運動、在開始時雖也有同樣的感覺、但熱習之後不　不覺因苦、反而感覺舒適、</p>
<p>在多兒童的家庭中施行這種運動必更為有效、因為能有比較和競爭的機會、</p>
<p>運動時的精神與遝動的成績有密切的關係、運動時如缺乏『精神的力量』、不僅無益、往往反而有害、　所以當兒童對於這種運動感覺厭倦、或暫時失去與趣點、勿使其勉强繼續運動、其實這種運動與兒童日常的衛生習慣無異、他們對於運動如有相當的認識、就不致遽爾中斷、或數衍從事、所以兒童運動的精神往往隨年齡而增進、則年齡愈大、精神愈佳、這雖不無例外、伹爲數實寥寥無幾、</p>
<p>前面巳說過兒童運動的目的是在使身體平均發展和促進健康、發達肌肉則尙屬次要、以發達肌肉爲主的運動、對於成年人雖甚適宜、但對於兒童、其功效却遠在以使身體平均發展爲主的運動之下、</p>
<p>若以發達肌肉爲主的運動施於兒童、目前也許不見有何弊害、甚至反而有很好的我績、　祗須過了若干時日、不　進步頓形遲慢或完全停止、各種弊害也層出不窮、各種最適合於兒童的運動、在目前也許沒有顯著的成績、但是不久就司見到驚人的進步、最後的成績必遠在任何運動之上、</p>
<p>體育的範圍甚廣、運動祗可說是其中的一小部分、營養、眠、沐浴、身體姿勢等都是體育的要素、如忽峪了這些要素、運動不僅無、反而有害、習慣成自然、在童年的時期、對於這種要素、就要養成良好的習慣、否則及至成年、就難於糾正、所以爲父母者、不僅要指導兒童運動、對於這種要素、與衛生當常識亦須切實注意、</p>
<p>最適宜於兒童的運動時間就是在淸早起林之後、沐浴或洗漱之前、淸早運動、不僅新鮮空氣、並能使兒童養成早眠早起的習慣、運動之後必須沐浴，冷水浴對於見童是不適宜的、但是在温水浴後、以冷水潑洗身體、則不可視爲冷水浴、這種方法、對於身體健全的兒童、不僅沒有弊害、並且是很有益的、鍛鍊兒童體格的方法為數烊不勝枚舉、但並不是都適合於每个兒童、也須因人而施、</p>
<p>兒童與成年人無異、在淸早起牀之後、如神志尚未完全清醒、也不可運舉行、運戰時穿衣愈少愈好、但注意切勿因此而受寒、如在室內舉行、須把動、須待至完全淸醒之後、方可窗戶儘行開放、</p>
<p>下午可以再稍行有益於身心的遊戲或球類等運動、藉以增加與　、使兒童對於運動不致因感覺枯燥或單調、而起厭倦之心、但須注意下午所行的運動或遊戲不可過於劇烈、球類等運動、對於兒童往往過於劇烈、輕重的程度亦難於調節、尤其是身體不甚健全的兒童、更沒有能力勝任這種運動過度對於成年人已有很大的損害　對於兒童當更不堪設想、</p>
<p>最後、普通對於兒童的解釋、所說不一、但本文所謂兒童乃指年齡在七歲至十六歲之間者而言、（中）</p>

<h3>集體創作與現實</h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>在現階段中國底千變萬化的抗戰現實中，作家們所能把握的，往往只是抗戰現實的一個斷片，一個側面，只有作家們在集體創作中組織起來，共同在一個主題下面，各自開展他對抗戰現實的一個角落，一個側面，一個斷片的把握共同容納每人作品之中，方才能够在一部作品之中，攝取和反映了客觀抗戰現實之全部豐富的內容：一個作家在單獨進行創作的時候，總難於把現實的本質全盤地汲取與表現，通常多數都祗能汲取和表現它的一少部分，或一個片面，但是在集體創作中，由於各个作家各自向現實的一側面發揮他的認識能力與表現能力，共同認識，共同表現，往往就容易汲取和表現出現實本質之全部豐富的多方面的內容，所以抗戰文藝爲獲取最完全精密的創作方法，自然需要特別强調特別着重集體創作。</p>
<p>我們知道抗戰文藝是作家們參加民族革命抗戰的最熟習的武罷，而抗戰文藹的集體創作，就是作家們使用他們的武器之最科學的方法，從寨集體創作的抗戰文藝作家，等於一個人拿了一柄利刃之外又學得了最精純的劍法，對於打擊×人，他能够發揮更偉大的作甩。並且抗戰文藝的集體創作，不僅能成爲中國作家們參加抗戰底集體鬥爭的武器，它更能成爲改進作家們的寫作技術與主觀意識的契機，因爲在集體創作的過中，一定要經過許多反覆不斷的集體討論，硏究，批判和修改的程序，作家們互相間一定發生了密切的糾正，批判和影響，在這種集體創作過稈之不斷的影嚮訓練之下，第一，可以提髙作家的寫作技術，把作家引導到正確　識現實，巧妙處理現實的題材，圓熟表現現實的更高的寫作技術上去，第二，可以矯止作家的主觀認識，把許多作家統一於一個共同的認識——正確世界觀上，改進他的主觀意識，所以抗戰文藝的集體創作，一方面也可以作爲作家改進自己的契機。</p>
<p>抗戰文藝的集體創作，根本是動的現實主義的創作方法之一範疇，它底實踐的過程，和具體的現實的實踐是不可分離地統一着的，作家從集體創作的一切活動中，必然地要與現實的實踐結合起來，不能像傳統的寫作方式那樣關在房子裏瞎寫，所以抗戰文化的集加創作，不單只是組織作家來從事抗戰的實踐（抗戰的實踐，就是現階段的現實實踐底最主要的形態），抗戰文藝底集體創作和集體主義的民族革命抗戰，有着無以復加的密切關係，作家投身於抗戰的集體鬥爭的激流中，這是集體創作所帶有的技術的組織性所使然的。</p>
<p>集體創作方法雖然是一　動的現實主義創作方法的範疇，我們固然需要要求一切現實主義的文藝工作者廣泛應用這一創作的實踐方式，但是抗戰文藝的集體創作，却不應局限在現實主義的文藝工作者之間，它可能而且應該在各種流派的文藝工作者底抗戰文藝創作實踐中廣泛開展，使成爲他們運用文藝武器的壹個最犀利的方式，更有力的執行自身戰鬥的任務。</p>
<p>集體創作是抗戰文藝跟抗戰現質結合的一條繫帶，是使作家跟大衆的抗戰生活接觸的一所橋樑，一切站在抗戰現實的激流中的文藝作家，要反　目前這壹劃時代的歷史巨變，要表達自己和自己的一羣在這抗戰現實中的戰鬥行動與現實生活，推動抗戰現實走上光榮勝利的前途，應該立刻普遍實踐這新型的集體創作，來配合自已抗戰實踐，表現抗戰現，實的眞實。</p>
<h3>單相思</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>兩性間的戀愛，是要建立在相互的關係上的。能互戀，然後纔能互愛。也惟有能生互戀，然後纔能生互愛。否則，任你拚命追逐，結果却逃避不了那悲慘的失敗的命運，落得一個『單相思』的　評。</p>
<p>相思的滋味最苦，單相思的情况則更尶尬。紅樓夢裏的賈瑞的死於王熙鳳之手，則是單相思朋友最悽慘的結局。有人說：王熙鳳的戲弄賈瑞，手段未免太毒辣。這句話似是而實非。他們祗看到王熙鳳毒設相思局，而忽略了賈瑞的『癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉』的意念和行爲，是招致死的因素。</p>
<p>單相思的朋友因爲色迷了心，理智也泯滅了。對於客觀的事實，主觀條件，忘記得乾凈凈，甚至得不到對方的反應，還『自說自話』，自得其樂。</p>
<p>單相思的故事，不僅兩性間時有新聞；而今國際間的陰謀，也有單相思事件的演出。譬如說：我們東隣的『友邦』，它們轉吳佩孚的念頭，在一年前已經動過腦筋了。最近更閙得有聲有色，像煞有介事。誰知據美聯社的消息：吳佩字的積極參預所謂『和平』運動之說，實屬某一方面之單田思。</p>
<p>其實，吳佩孚的參預不參預所謂『和平』運動，根本於中國的抗戰前途，沒什麼重大影響：理由是：吳佩孚到今日還能博得一部份中國同胞當作偶像般崇拜，因爲他具有一身傲骨；倘然靦　事仇，那麽便消失了被人崇拜的條件，也發生不出果隣『友邦』所要發生的作用了。但是威武不能屈，富貴不能淫，自比岳武穆的吳佩孚將軍，他豈肯晚節不香，上東隣『友邦』的圈套，傀侷登塲　關於這一點，東隣『友邦』何嘗不曉得，奈因在軍事無法進展，國際形勢孤立，國內怨聲載道，和對舉政治陰謀屢道失敗的苦惱情况之下，饞出此下策，　知又撲了個空，依舊是個單相思。</p>
<p>單相思的演進，是會成功『花痴』的，花痴有文武之別：文的，痴痴呆呆，不知人事：武的，瘋瘋癲癲，胡作胡爲。結果，不爲廢物，必致死亡。聽說東鄰『友邦』因爲匃搭吳傳孚不成，想轉變方法，採用硬的手段，那麼單相思的朋友將成功武花痴了。悲夫。</p>
<h3>宣傳技巧</h3>
<p>— 拉特</p>
<p>在抗敵救國的事業上，誰都已經深切地了解宣傅工作的重要。同樣說一句，在今天大家都已經感釗了加緊瓦解×人宣傳是一件萬分追切的工作。然而宣傳工作，究竟怎樣才能够收到積極的效果？此中固然有了不少愛國志士加以嚴密的探討與正確的發揮。但我們有時也看到自命爲明白之士，在發揮其瓦解×人的宣傅的主張時，却往往因爲對事題的認識不淸與個人成見太深的緣故，而弄出反作用的可悲現象，這是値得大家警惕的。</p>
<p>現在爲着加緊淪陷區的黨政工作，對於×軍兵士進行宣傳，以瓦解他們的力量，或降低他們的戰鬥情絡，這自然是重要的一面，其實我們對×人的宣傳的目的也是這一點。爲要達到這一目的，我們此際應該用種種方法，或以文字，或由直接，和×人的前方兵士接觸，煽動他們反戰的决心，激發他們明白中國抗戰的立塲，明白他們本國政　的侵略目的，以及中國必勝，日本必敗的前途。因爲近來×軍　戰反戰的思想，已經普遍的發展，假和我們不正確的把握這點，而還爲了一黨一派的成見，標明自己那種不正確的宣傳話題），那不但是失了瓦解×人的宣傳的任務，反而弄出與宣傳的目的背道而馳的笑話出來。這是不可不注意的。</p>
<p>日軍閥對着到中國來的士乓的宣傳，主要的還是說要來征服非文明的，未開化的，仇日的，排日的中國而且還是說，要來開發東亞的廣大富源，永久奠定日本國强民富，雄視世界的唯一基礎。假如我們不從這方面去理解，而堅持黨派成見，造出對×軍士兵的反戰心理不相配各的宣傳資料，這只有會惑亂×軍視聽，而沒有適應着×軍士的心理上的要求，這樣的宣傳方法是最要不得的事，也是我們不應該固執的事。</p>
<h3>廢墟與砲煙</h3>
<p>— 尾崎士郞作　林煥平譯</p>
<p>在游擊隊出沒的江岸地帶，完成偵察的任務被認爲是極度的困難。緋威伍長雖終得無事歸還本部，但做探子，出去了卽永不歸來的勇士却相當地多似的。最初守備湖口的，是某某部隊在這裏有部隊本部，爲着防備游擊隊，三分兵力，在離市　若于米突的山蔭間佈防着。然而，精悍的游擊隊之一部，感覺到日本軍的部隊本部的兵力單薄，於是在白書裏潛伏在山蔭裏待機，到了黎明，四百多人就巧妙地　越過步哨線，逼近部隊本部來了。發見的時候已經太遲了，被×人乘着不備的部隊本部，那時只有不足百人的兵力，也沒有辨法，只好卽刻整備武裝，準備戰鬥。這時候，從山谷之間的坡路激流似地衝下來的×人步伐，突然地停止了。僅僅是四五分鐘時間，但是，沒有像這四力分鐘一樣，對于日軍是占有這樣重要的。是幽閱的深夜，不能看得出對方的形態，這是比什都麽僥倖的，佈下有利的陣勢的日本軍，積極地開始攻擊了。被制了機先的×人，有點狼狽的時候，在前線山　地帶的大部隊日本軍趕來威脅着×人的背後。×人不知不覺成腹背受夾擊的形勢，于是戰鬥不足一小時，便結束了。但是，一氣衝激過來的敵人的步武，何以會在通到部隊本部的隘路的入口，突然停止了呢？——這始終是一個重大的疑問。日子過去了，後來才發見一個事實。最初知道×人來襲的，是一個爲着換班站崗，從反對方面走着同一道路來的上等兵。偷偷地走近來的，走在敵人部隊之光頭的男子，和他碰到了。不用說，有這樣的大部隊來偷襲，地是沒有想像到似的，當時他的認識，認爲是華軍的探子迷了路吧。上等兵某君立刻舉起槍，大聲一喝：</p>
<p>『淺草的勘乓衞你知道嗎？』</p>
<p>淺草的勘兵衞——這樣奇怪的話，當然是爲中國乒所聽不進去的聲昔，如果上等兵某君開槍，或者是用刺刀刺殺對方，則必不會發生這樣的結果了吧。　了「淺草的勘兵衛』，舉起了槍，這樣在他心理上以爲是潛藏着退敵的理山了。在市的後方山谷間，看到紅瓦屋頂的人家。</p>
<p>『那是什麽呢？』我這樣問。</p>
<p>『啊，那是成問題的啦』。井上大佐囘答，『總是有人住在那裏似的，但是，忙得要命，還沒有到過那樣的地方去。今日是說去吧，明日又說去吧，但斷定了恐不會有什麼大不了的傢伙在那裏，便就那樣的放置着，沒有去了。』</p>
<p>我種種色色地想像着遺留下來在那山谷間生活着的人的姿態。那個時候，突然，從牆柱墻壁都全被破壞了的民家的奧堂之幽暗裏，有剝落地動起來了的東西，恐縮地恐縮地窺伺着，沿着古壁一個影子漸漸地處近來了。是六十開外的——恐怕是唯一的遺留在這城市的老太婆。她用隱着一半哀願，一半經侮的眼睛，死死的釘着我們。井上大佐對她說話，她就在油汗閃閃地光耀着的臉上，浮起自嘲的蹈媚的笑。</p>
<p>『聽說這是這個女人的老家呀。』　（未完）</p>
<h3>圍剿</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>塘裏泊着千百千艘小船，密密層層，遠遠望過去，像魚鱗一般。外邊海口也泊有百來　大船漁，那些帆影，像一片美麗豐茂的竹林。</p>
<p>太陽爬出海面，掀起洶湧的巨浪，向塘裏打來，千餘艘漁船不停地晃盪着，驚動了那批年靑結實的漁民。他們一骨碌地跳起身，抹了抹眼睛，收起錨繩，快活地唱着：「……組宗留下的基業，靠它過夏也過冬。黄花魚勝，黄金；長帶魚，比玉環……那怕强盜多，我們齊心不怕他兇，我們是勇敢的漁民！……」他們那樣哼着，他們便開始他們底工作。</p>
<p>前面先走的大漁船，長長的一列，眞像一長串帶魚。雄壯的歌聲，充滿了整個的海。在海　裏，帶來了遠處的空虛的囘聲。</p>
<p>出了海口，船隻四面分散，各自去綱魚，拋下了大漁網，靜悄悄地。</p>
<p>港面非常平靜，像睡去了一般。</p>
<p>在海的一角，突然出現一艘懸有膏藥旂的小兵船，逕向大漁船這邊駛來。</p>
<p>『啊；强盜來了？咱們等死嗎？……不！不！先下手爲强，小三，你吹號，讓他們同來相帮：海根，你們準備砲，快！快！』船老大與奮地叫着。自巳也跑到士砲邊，帮着上火藥。</p>
<p>『的大……的的大……』號角響了。</p>
<p>『蓬！』老大親自放出了第一砲，砲彈飛過去，打在鬼子船的即部，船頭略略向前震了一震。</p>
<p>『蓬！』强盜船也回了一炮，炮彈飛過來，離開一隻漁船沒有多遠，激起了幾丈高的浪花。</p>
<p>『咯咯咯……』强盜船放機關槍了，</p>
<p>『夥計，放槍呀，快快，呆甚麼呀，糟糕，放槍，放槍呀，快，快，』，老大拉直了喉囉，大聲地呼喊，自己從身　的一個夥計手中，奪過來一把土炮，瞄準就放。</p>
<p>『蓬……蓬……』强盜的炮及土炮。</p>
<p>『咯……咯咯……』機開槍。</p>
<p>「拍—劈拍—……劈拍……！」土槍。</p>
<p>不久，另外許多大漁船，循着號音駛來了。他們發覺了這裏的危急，便立刻東一艘，西一艘地都向那强盜船包圍過來，像許多餓透了的魚兒，競爭着一塊大麵包</p>
<p>『蓬！蓬！……』砲彈像雨點般地飛向强盜船，它受着猛然的攻擊，開始有些傾斜了。</p>
<p>「呀！』一顆子彈。打中了老大底髙舉着的手臂，殷紅的血在衣袖裏冒着，他不由地喊了一聲。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦？老大？你？你？』，夥計們都圍了過來。</p>
<p>「瘋了嗎？別管我？放砲？放槍？快放？快？快…」老大突出了眼珠子，咬緊牙齒。</p>
<p>『蓬—蓬蓬—……拍—劈拍—劈—……』</p>
<p>强盜船受不住了，尾部先沒到水裏，接着中部……，最末是頭部，濃烈的白烟，冒在水面上，逐灘散開，最後，强盜船旂杆上的膏藥旂，也一同消滅在水裏了。</p>
<p>『蓬…蓬蓬蓬—』向强盜船沉沒的水面，放了最後幾下送葬的禮砲。</p>
<p>老大舉起血淋淋的手臂，大家都與奮地和着唱道…『……那怕强盜多，我們齊心不怕兇—我們是　敢的漁民！……』</p>
<p>受傷者底臉上映着榮譽的光輝，早忘却了創痛。他們終於把侵略的强盜殲滅，報了海天大仇！</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Land on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Japanese ×× troops landed on Hainan Island in large numbers before dawn yesterday. The exact landing location is still unknown, but it is expected that our troops stationed in Qiongya and the local people are bravely resisting. Although our senior military authorities have not made any announcements regarding this matter, general observations indicate that they are paying close attention to the future trend of the South China war situation.</p>
<p>The Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island is by no means a trivial matter. It will have a very significant impact not only on the South China war situation but also on the overall situation of China's war of resistance, as well as on the international situation in the Far East and the future of the current world war—the two-front war. We would like to express the following points based on our usual observations to draw the attention of our countrymen and friendly nations.</p>
<p>Hainan Island is an important stronghold on the front line of our national defense in southern China, the most important shield for our southwestern anti-Japanese base, and an important gateway for countries such as Britain and France to maintain their interests in the Far East. At the same time, it is also a key area that Japanese fascists must occupy first in order to complete their continental policy and launch their maritime strategy. Therefore, the Japanese ×× have been plotting to invade Hainan Island for a long time. Since the full-scale outbreak of our country's anti-Japanese war, young military leaders in Japan, especially naval leaders, have repeatedly advocated that "to conquer China, we must first implement the South China strategy, and to perfectly execute the South China strategy, we must first occupy Guangzhou, especially Hainan Island." Before Guangzhou fell last year, the Japanese × launched the so-called 'attack on the Soviet Union' at Zhanggufeng to divert the world's attention, while secretly attacking Hainan Island in an attempt to occupy it in one fell swoop. At that time, fortunately, our side paid close attention, aroused international attention, and the Soviet Union resolutely and bravely crushed the Japanese military's provocative plan, exposed the Japanese smoke screen plot, and the French authorities were also able to quickly make strong representations, causing the Japanese adventurous plan to fail completely. However, the Japanese ×'s conspiracy has been going on every day since.</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese ×'s plan to blockade our country's coast and cut off our transportation, trade, and commerce with foreign countries was nearing completion. The Japanese military authorities believed that the only regret was the failure to occupy Hainan Island, which allowed our country to maintain a considerable degree of initiative and advantage in the southern battlefield, and also allowed Britain and France to maintain a considerable degree of initiative and advantage in their Far Eastern relations, hindering the implementation of the Japanese ××'s westward and southward invasion plans. Therefore, the Japanese ×'s current strategy for South China, in addition to trying to consolidate the occupation of Guangzhou, is to devote all its efforts to arranging the seizure of Hainan Island and the spying on the southern route. Regarding this point, we have repeatedly pointed out in "World Trends in a Week" in order to arouse the vigilance of all parties.</p>
<p>The Japanese × had been planning for a long time but still did not dare to launch a military operation against Hainan Island, partly due to the lack of their own troops, and the military leaders had no confidence in the steps to be taken after forcibly occupying Hainan Island. On the other hand, it was due to spying on the attitude of the British and French authorities towards the Far East. However, now the Japanese × have finally launched a military operation to forcibly occupy Hainan Island. Have the Japanese × side's two difficult problems been resolved? We can answer in two points: First, the recent continued compromise between Britain and France on the Italian invasion of Spain, the "victory" of the Italian invaders in Spain, and the serious situation in Europe it caused, first emboldened the Japanese ×× to take risks in the Far East, especially towards the southwest; second, the exhaustion of Japanese military spending is a serious problem at present. The huge military budget of 730 million yen for the next fiscal year, which will begin on April 1, will be submitted to the parliament for approval in the next few days. The Japanese army and navy authorities must rush to create a serious situation in order to ensure the smooth passage of the huge military budget. Judging from the Japanese ×'s provocations against the Soviet Union on the Japanese-Manchukuo-Soviet border in the past few days, followed by the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island yesterday, we can clearly understand their motives and intentions.</p>
<p>The importance of Hainan Island to our country's southern anti-Japanese war is a well-known fact. The importance of Hainan Island to Britain, the United States, and France in maintaining their interests in the Far East is also recognized by all discerning people in the world. If Hainan Island is forcibly occupied by the Japanese army, it can not only be used as a base to attack Guangxi, cut off our only international passage in South China to the west, and bypass Xianggui in the north to open up the entire Yuehan line, but also serve as a base for Japanese fascists to implement their westward and southward invasion strategy based on the maritime strategy. In this way, it will not only affect the entire coastline of French Indochina, but also threaten the shipping and all trade interests of Britain, the United States, and other countries east of Singapore. I still remember that in March last year, the French government sent a note to the Japanese side because the Japanese army attempted to spy on Hainan Island, stating that France had a treaty with China, in which France had the obligation to prohibit foreigners from landing on Hainan Island. Later, the British authorities also expressed their agreement with this attitude of France and warned Japan. Therefore, the Japanese ×'s current landing on Hainan Island is actually ×××××××××, actually ×××××× and other countries related to the Far East ××××. The reason why we should especially point out that the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island is a serious international event is also because of this.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island is what we must point out and arouse the attention of our countrymen and friendly nations. However, we not only do not feel the slightest fear about the Japanese ×'s move, but also make us more excited to persevere in the courage of unity and resistance. Because first, from a military point of view, although our past deployment in Hainan Island was not completely satisfactory, and the number of troops stationed there was greatly insufficient, especially in terms of popular mobilization and political propaganda, it was not enough. However, the island already has experienced and well-organized guerrillas, and the people who are full of patriotism and national consciousness will, under the leadership of the revolutionary army reorganized from the Red Army, launch a battle to defend their homeland and country, and give the Japanese × a heavy blow. Secondly, in terms of terrain, Hainan Island is an area of ​​overlapping mountains, and the Japanese ×'s activities are extremely difficult. The Wuzhi Mountain, which is up to 5,000 feet high and rich in products, has always been a strong base for the Red Army, and will surely become an anti-Japanese base, making it impossible for the Japanese × to have a foothold for a long time. Finally, we should not ignore the difficulty of the Japanese ×'s insufficient troops, which still has not been resolved. Perhaps this landing by the Japanese army will once again stage ××××× a farce. However, we still cannot but ask our countrymen and friendly people to pay attention: First, the Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island this time, regardless of whether its intention is to threaten internally and provoke or test ××, or both, the Japanese ×'s adventure of invading westward and southward in the future will inevitably become more rampant as the German progress in Europe; therefore, we must not only strengthen the national defense of the southwest, but also urge Britain and France to adopt a more active policy, using further action to aid China and contain Japan to respond to the Japanese ×'s unreasonable provocation. Second, the Japanese × have a conspiracy to take advantage of the appeasement policy of some British and French rulers. They will use the forcible occupation of Hainan Island as a condition to strive for favorable terms when holding international conferences. They will use it to coerce British and French rulers to come forward to mediate the "Sino-Japanese conflict." They will use it to coerce France to block international routes for transportation to China, and facilitate the implementation of their southwest strategy. The British and French rulers, based on not very accurate observations, do not want our country to be destroyed by Japan, and even more do not want China to defeat the Japanese × and achieve liberation with the help of the Soviet Union. Therefore, preparations for mediating the "Sino-Japanese conflict" have never been relaxed. Now we should more clearly advise friendly people who hold this erroneous view, point out the new situation in which the interests of Britain, France, and China are consistent, and demand that they not be deceived by the Japanese conspiracy and jointly and effectively sanction the Japanese × in order to maintain Far Eastern security.</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week</h3>
<p>— Lang Pan</p>
<p>From February 4th to 10th, 28th Year</p>
<p>It's springtime! Although the international situation is so dangerous, and the flames of war in the motherland are so rampant, the blood flag of resistance has been raised high among the masses who have been invaded and oppressed all over the world! The victorious horn is encouraging every daughter who seeks freedom to fight more bravely and move forward!</p>
<p>The current events of the first week of the Spring Festival tell us: The fascist invaders, the rulers of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, are preparing even more frantically for internal repression and external expansion; democratic countries such as Britain and France have shouted out the roar of resistance to hegemony, but they still have more illusions than determination; only the Soviet Union, the socialist motherland, has once again demonstrated in Europe and the Far East the determination to defend peace and the independence of all people with strength. Looking back at our motherland, it is still under the haze of × people's artillery fire, but the × people's power has gradually declined, and the × people's crisis is becoming more and more serious. On the contrary, our power is becoming more and more vast, and our crisis is turning sharply. Therefore, we believe that whether it is the world or China, the fascist invaders are preparing for their final show of strength, and our forces of resistance still need to redouble their efforts to increase fear and develop!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the arrival of spring and everyone's spirit, let's put in more effort for the liberation of the nation and the freedom of mankind!</p>
<p>A Bird's-Eye View of the War Situation in a Week</p>
<p>Although the × troops in various places have begun to move on a larger scale, the war situation this week has remained relatively stable. The main plan for spying on the × troops is to confuse our army with chaotic movements on various lines, while stepping up the consolidation of the rule in the occupied areas, 'cleaning up' the guerrillas, and at the same time mobilizing considerable troops to prepare for a large-scale offensive. First, let's talk about North China. The × side has recently expanded its propaganda to launch a large-scale offensive against the Northwest. The × troops in various places in Central China and North China have also indeed transferred some brigades to Yuxi. At the same time, one route in the north is plotting to invade Ningxia and Gansu from Chahar and Suiyuan, and one route in the east is once again forcibly crossing the Yellow River from Yu and Jin. Therefore, fierce battles broke out in various places in Suiyuan and Shanxi this week, especially in Fenglingdu and eastern Jin. The result was that the two routes of × troops collapsed one after another under the joint operations of our army and air force. On the 5th, our air force bombed the Yuncheng × airport, and more than a dozen × aircraft were destroyed. In addition, in the Zhongtiao Mountain area in southern Jin, 7,000 to 8,000 × people have been wiped out in the past two weeks. Our army in central Hebei, eastern Henan, and the border between Hebei, Chahar, and Jin launched a fierce counteroffensive, and also gave a major blow to the × who came to support. Now the relationship between the military and civilians of all ethnic groups in the Northwest is becoming more and more harmonious, and the internal conflicts of the × army are fierce, so the so-called general offensive against the Northwest is difficult to achieve for a while. As for South China, × Commander Ando held a military conference of the army, navy, and air force in Guangzhou on the 2nd. As a result, he had no confidence in the battle to open up the Yuehan Road, so he decided to first launch a large-scale westward invasion. He has transferred 24 warships from Taiwan to cooperate with the air and land forces, using the island as a base and Beihai as a gateway, and the first step is to occupy Hainan Island and actively promote the westward and southward invasion plan. Therefore, in the past week, the × troops in Dongjiang and Beijiang have only been making a show of strength, while the situation in the Xijiang Southern Route has become increasingly tense. Now our Guangdong military has a new deployment. Yu Hanmou is responsible for the northern route and implements offensive defense; Wu Qiwai commands the eastern route and launches guerrilla offensives; Xia Wei is responsible for the western route. In recent days, our army in the northern route has launched a three-way counteroffensive, and fierce battles have taken place in Taipingchang and Chibaini. The preparation for the counteroffensive in Dongjiang is also largely in place. Guerrilla troops in Dongguan, Baoan, Huiyang, Boza, Heyuan, and Zengcheng are actively strengthening. The Xijiang, with close coordination between our army and air force, will advance in three routes. The right wing will take Heshan as a base, seize Jiujiang, and sweep along the Jiangfo Highway towards Lianglong and Foshan. The left wing will take Lubao as a base, cut off the Guangyun Chantan Road, and cooperate with the right wing to surround the Guangsan Road and cut off the connection between Guangzhou and the front-line × troops in Xijiang. The southern route has been reinforced by elite troops. Although the situation in the southwest is tight, there is no need to worry about the overall situation. (While writing this draft, I learned that this morning, the 10th, a part of the × army landed on Hainan Island, and I will write another editorial for this, please refer to it.) As for the × army in Central China, although it is active in central Hubei and the border between Hunan and Jiangxi, it has made no progress. Since the Nanchang military conference on the 2nd, our army has been fully confident in preventing the × army from peeping into Changsha and Nanchang. In addition, in response to the × army's plan to 'clean up' the guerrillas, the guerrilla battles in the northern and eastern battlefields have also made greater progress in the past week. On the eastern battlefield, our army recovered Luodian and Baoshan, while the New Fourth Army attracted 50,000 × troops on the Jinghang Road; on the northern battlefield, fierce battles took place in various places on the border between Hebei and Chahar and northeastern Shandong, which contained a large number of × troops on the PingSui, PingHan, PingShen, and JinPu lines, giving our army on the front lines of the north and south battlefields a greater opportunity for development.</p>
<p>Our Military, Political, and Diplomatic Situation</p>
<p>In the past week, our country's military, political, diplomatic, rear-area construction, and the combat and construction work in the occupied areas have made considerable progress. First of all, our army's combat power is growing stronger.</p>
<p>Growing Strength</p>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang emphasized this point in his report in Chongqing on the 4th of this month, and listed the following facts: (1) Currently, in Hebei Province alone in North China, our side has 200,000 troops, ruling more than 80 counties, and killing an average of 300 to 400 × people every day. (2) The guerrilla work and political work in the Northeast will have further progress. General Bai Chongxi also gave a speech in Kunming on the 6th of this month, proving with the experience of 19 months of the war of resistance that our army's combat power is becoming stronger and stronger. We are absolutely advantageous militarily, politically, economically, and internationally. More than 10,000 listeners at the entire venue applauded and cheered enthusiastically. On the 7th of this month, the Soviet Union's Pravda even used the headline "New China is Growing Up" to discuss the strengthening of our country's military strength, the progress of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the optimistic prospects for the war of resistance. Reuters reporter Sassoon also sent out an important telegram after entering Sichuan from Vietnam via Guizhou and Yunnan, pointing out the prospects for our country's victory.</p>
<p>Military and Political Unity</p>
<p>The organization of the Supreme National Defense Council was announced on the 7th of this month, with Mr. Chiang, the president of the Kuomintang, concurrently serving as the chairman. The 11 standing committee members are also concurrently served by the ministers of various ministries and other positions, and Zhang Qun is the secretary-general. Although its organization and mission are quite different from what was reported by foreign media before, first, this meeting will inevitably unify the national military, political, party affairs, and mass movement, which will greatly benefit the war of resistance. Second, in this new stage of the war of resistance, only by making politics more progressive and consolidating the unity of all parties and all sectors of society can we guarantee the smooth progress of the war of resistance and national construction and strive for final victory. We believe that the government's efforts in this regard will certainly be demonstrated by facts.</p>
<p>International Assistance</p>
<p>There have also been many expressions of international assistance to our country this week. What is particularly worth reporting is: First, a telegram from Washington on the 4th stated that Chen Guangfu, the representative of the Chinese Silver Group, was in negotiations with a certain consortium for a credit loan, and as a result, a credit loan of 15 million US dollars was established to enhance our country's currency. Second, a telegram from London on the 8th stated that the British financial community had a good response to our country's maintenance of creditworthiness, and that further financial assistance to China was being carefully considered. At the same time, British government officials who are most directly related to discussing China's needs are also discussing granting our country a credit loan to develop the southwestern economy, and plan to use actual loans to support our country's currency system. Third, there is further cooperation in Sino-British aviation, and the Hong Kong-Yunnan-Burma-New Air Line is about to be established. In addition, such as the Hong Kong English South China Morning Post on the 7th published that the leaders of the US government unanimously warmly assisted China, such as Reuters London's 8th telegram stating that the British House of Commons urged the British government to put more pressure on Japan, which can prove that the international situation continues to be favorable to us.</p>
<p>Japan in the Midst of Four Crises</p>
<p>In contrast to the situation of internal unity and external assistance in our country, the internal and external crises of the Japanese fascist invaders have entered a greater stage of outbreak. Just from the publicly published news in various newspapers this week, we can see that the ×'s invasion of China is certainly not sure of victory, the so-called large-scale general offensive has not been implemented immediately, and the so-called political offensive has also failed again due to Wang Jingwei's escape and Wu Peifu's decision to maintain his integrity in his later years. The domestic and international crises in Japan are becoming more and more serious. Here are a few pieces of evidence:</p>
<p>Exhausted Source of Troops</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the all-out war, up to the end of January this year, the × army has suffered at least 700,000 casualties. There are about 1,020,000 × in China, including 400,000 in the Northeast and 620,000 in North China and Central China. If the × army wants to continue to invade China or fight against the Soviet Union, the current force is obviously not enough, and the most that can be transferred from the country is only 400,000, which will make the × afraid of being empty in the country!</p>
<p>Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Also, from the outbreak of the war to January this year, according to various statistics, the Japanese military expenditure has reached at least 8.8 billion yen, while our military expenditure is 2 billion yuan, and our expenditure is only a quarter of that of the Japanese. If the war continues in the future, our country's consumption will increase, and the increase in the ×'s expenditure will be doubled. The special budget for the Japanese navy and army expenditures for the next year, which is scheduled to begin on April 1, will be submitted to the parliament for approval in the next few days. The total amount is about 730 million yen, of which the army's military expenditure has increased from 382.1 million to 540 million yen, which has led to a conflict between the navy and the army over military expenditure, and this huge budget is too much for the entire Japanese country to bear, and the bankruptcy crisis is imminent.</p>
<p>Anti-War Rage</p>
<p>The Japanese people deeply feel that this war is only a war for the interests of a few monopolistic capital leaders and military figures, and they are on the verge of despair under the heavy burden of the war. Therefore, the anti-war rage is surging, and the × army is mutinying loudly, and the puppet troops are defecting one after another. Just based on this week's telegraphic news, countless examples can be cited: (1) Central News Agency Chongqing telegram on the 5th, on the 21st and 22nd of last month, 3,000 × troops mutinied in Dagu, and as a result, they were transported to the front line of Jin and Sui in two batches. (2) The same telegram from Tunxi on the 6th, a few days ago, more than 500 × soldiers in Jiangyin mutinied against the war, and the × commander was killed. (3) The same telegram from Shanghai on the 6th, more than 100 Japanese workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai were arrested for anti-war activities. (4) The same telegram from Huaiyin on the 7th, Xu Yankun, a puppet army general in Jiangsu, led more than 1,000 of his troops to defect, and the puppet troops of Li Guanying in the north and Liu Fulong in the south also defected. (5) The same telegram from Chongqing on the 9th, the × army in Hankou established a large anti-war organization and carried out a major riot, echoing the × army's riot in Tianjin a few days ago. Unfortunately, it was detected, and more than 100 leaders, including military police officers and army officers, were arrested. (6) The same telegram also stated: The left-leaning ideology of the × army in China is increasing, and various secret organizations are developing very quickly. A certain party's Hongkou branch in Japan has advanced anti-war propaganda to actual actions. (7) The same telegram also stated that anti-war sentiment is widespread in Japan, and a large number of officials from the Ministry of the Army have secretly participated. Currently, there have been many cases of exposure, such as the theft of information by Machijiri, an official from the military department, and the actress Ms. Tanaka.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Movement</p>
<p>The anti-war and anti-fascist people's front movement, under the leadership of the weak but hardworking Japanese Communist Party, has recently seen dramatic development in Japan. The above examples are just a few. For the Japanese people to seek their own liberation, for the liberation of all nations and for world peace, this heroic struggle of the Japanese people and the hardships they have suffered are worthy of everyone's emotion and reflection! Now this struggle has spread to Taiwan, Korea, and various parts of the Northeast. Central News Agency Chongqing telegram on the 3rd stated: Taiwan ×× patriots sneaked back to their hometowns to work, and Korean Jeonju workers revolted on January 28th, which are the latest examples.</p>
<p>Aggression Conspiracy</p>
<p>From this we can know that the Japanese × cannot fight again and has no strength to fight again! From this we can know why the Japanese × is carrying out bombings and massacres more frantically, and from this we can know why the Japanese × is trying to buy off rebel parties and bandits in China and internationally by threatening and enticing, and propagating anti-communism, propagating peace, and mediating! The facts are already clear: China can and must defeat the Japanese × and obtain true peace, freedom, and happiness only by persisting in united resistance to the end. If anti-communism and peace negotiations are implemented today, regardless of whether this movement is initiated by traitors and pro-Japanese elements, or advocated by a few bureaucrats and politicians in the country, or if there is coercion from foreign countries, the result will only save the Japanese invaders, only wrong our heroic struggles and heavy sacrifices over the past 19 months, only make the Chinese nation and the Japanese nation perish forever, and only make the world war spread even more! The Reuters telegram from Chongqing on the 9th reported that Chinese "political figures" discussed China's reiteration of its determination to resist the war, and among them, they all claimed that "only by convening a Far East international conference similar to the Second Washington Conference can the existing Sino-Japanese conflict be resolved." If this news is true, it cannot be considered as the attitude of our authorities, and it is even more unacceptable to the Chinese people!</p>
<p>The Fall of Catalonia</p>
<p>After the fall of Barcelona, ​​Catalonia is already on the verge of falling as a whole! The fall of Catalonia is not because the Spanish government army cannot resist the war and has no strength to resist the war, nor is it because the Spanish people cannot resist the war and has no strength to resist the war, but because of the unscrupulous assistance of the Italian and German invaders to the rebel army and the large-scale offensive, especially because of the British and French rulers' "non-intervention" policy, which on the one hand condoned the Italian and German crazy offensive, and on the other hand prevented the Spanish government from legally purchasing military supplies from foreign countries and obtaining assistance. After the fall of Catalonia, the Spanish government's situation is certainly more difficult, and the threat to France and Britain is even greater. Because now the Italian and German invaders can establish air force bases on the Spanish coast to cut off the transportation lines from Britain and France to African colonies, and make the British Gibraltar completely lose its military value. Moreover, France is now under the three-sided encirclement of the Italian and German invaders. Furthermore, Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea has become a thing in Italy's pocket, and Mussolini is already preparing to make new colonial demands and control the Suez Canal. In the future, it is inevitable that Italy and Germany will cooperate to further threaten Britain and France to divide the colonies! The total outbreak of world war</p>

<h3>× Landing on Hainan Island: All Nations Feel a Grave Threat; France Will Lodge a Serious Protest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tokyo dispatch: According to Japanese official sources, Japanese troops have landed on Hainan Island. It is claimed that elite Japanese naval and army units launched a sudden landing on Hainan Island this morning and are now jointly advancing inland.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tokyo dispatch: Japanese troops attacked Hainan Island this morning. France regards Hainan Island as a shield for protecting Annam. The western end of the island is only 140 miles from the Annam coast. The Japanese General Headquarters issued a communiqué this morning stating that Japanese troops suddenly attacked Hainan Island at dawn and landed on the island. Elite Japanese naval and army units are now jointly advancing inland. Details are unknown. (Note: Some factions within the Japanese military have long advocated occupying Hainan Island. One faction advocates occupying the island as a base for Japan to advance towards the Annam border, so as to prevent military supplies from being transported from Annam to our inland areas.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch: According to neutral observers, the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island will have a significant impact on the Philippines. This is because the Philippines originally intended to create a neutral status after achieving independence. Hainan Island was also guaranteed neutrality by the Franco-Japanese agreement. Today, the Japanese army has launched a large-scale landing. If the Japanese army establishes naval and air bases on Hainan Island, then the area is only 500 miles from the Philippines, which will pose a great threat to the safety of the Philippines.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch: Naval figures from various countries returning to the East are closely watching the development of the Hainan Island issue. Various parties here believe that Hainan Island has the potential to become the "Mallorca Island" of the Far East. (Note: Mallorca Island is one of the Balearic Islands belonging to Spain in the Mediterranean Sea. Together with Minorca, it is the center of the Balearic Islands and is now in the hands of the Spanish rebel army, controlled by Italy for some time). Naval figures state that Hainan Island is a militarily important island in the Far East. This is not only because the island is only 70 miles from the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay and 160 miles from French Annam, but also because the island is conveniently located between the Singapore-Hong Kong shipping route. The island, along with Taiwan and the Japanese mandated territory of the Caroline Islands, forms a semi-circle surrounding the Philippines on its east, west, and north sides. Hainan Island has two deep-water ports, Haikou and Yulin. Haikou is at the northern end of Hainan Island, and Yulin Port is at the southern end of Hainan Island. Although the island has not yet been fully developed, it can become a very important naval base in the future. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1895, the entire Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet, after being transferred to the Sea of Japan for combat, once anchored in the Hainan Strait.</p>
<p>Our Government Is Not Surprised</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] Various parties in Chongqing have learned of the landing of × on Hainan Island and generally believe that it includes the intention to demonstrate to France. According to Gui telegrams, ×'s deployment in South China seems to be complete, attempting to launch another invasion. Fierce battles on various fronts will begin shortly. We have long prepared heavy troops on all fronts, waiting in strict formation. The eastern disturbance of × will surely suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 10th] Official sources here do not express surprise at the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, but they pay close attention to the international implications of this matter in the South China Sea. Chinese and foreign figures generally believe that: (1) The Japanese occupation of Hainan Island is actually an infringement on the interests of Britain, the United States, France, and China in South China, and does not directly harm China, because the importance of the island has been greatly reduced since the fall of Guangzhou. (2) Because Hainan Island is located near Annam's Tonkin Gulf, the Japanese occupation of the island poses a threat to France, whether from the sea or the air. (3) Isolating the connection between the French port of Guangzhou Bay and Annam. (4) Placing the Japanese army in an advantageous position to attack Bataan Island. (5) Endangering the future of the Philippines. (6) Directly violating the Franco-Japanese agreement of last year.</p>
<p>× Has Violated the Franco-Japanese Agreement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch: According to neutral observers, France will lodge a very strong protest against the Japanese army's attack on Hainan, because the Japanese army's actions are actually violating the provisions of the Franco-Japanese agreement, which designated Hainan as a neutral zone. Britain is also very concerned because this move by the Japanese army will threaten the traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore. Moreover, neutral parties state that the Japanese occupation of Hainan poses a great threat to the Philippines because the Japanese side has not indicated that it will withdraw from Hainan in the future. In addition to being an important strategic location, the island is also the largest producer of raw materials in South China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Tokyo dispatch: According to legal experts, in March 1897, the Chinese and French governments exchanged official documents, declaring that the Chinese government would not cede Hainan Island to other countries. In 1907, Japanese and French representatives signed an agreement in Paris, stipulating that the two countries should respect China's independence and territorial integrity. At the same time, regarding the Chinese territory and the parts adjacent to the two countries, the two countries should mutually guarantee the safety and peace of the area. Although Hainan was not explicitly mentioned in the text, it was intended to refer to the area.</p>
<p>The British Side Will Take Decisive Action</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] British officials are awaiting further reports on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island and have not commented. It is generally believed that since the Japanese side claimed in June of last year that it wanted to land on the island, it has repeatedly hinted that it may land at any time to meet military needs, so this is not surprising. However, although the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of occupying the island for a long time, the House of Commons will inevitably oppose it. It is believed that as a result of parliamentary inquiries on Monday, the government will be ordered to take decisive action to fulfill the joint warning of Britain and France in June of last year.</p>
<p>× Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Deceptive Talk</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] The spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared at a reception for reporters today that the Japanese attack on Hainan Island is entirely a military necessity and that there is absolutely no intention to violate the Franco-Japanese agreement of 1907.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th] The Japanese government spokesman did not answer the question of whether the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island was intended to prevent military supplies from Annam from being transported to China. The Japanese government has not notified the French authorities of the purpose of this move. It is generally believed that the purpose of the Japanese army is to cut off the traffic of military supplies to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th] A Japanese naval spokesman stated that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island has two purposes: (1) to prevent military supplies from being transported to China; (2) to quickly defeat the "Chiang regime," end the war, and improve Japan's relations with third countries. The spokesman also said, "The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is a 'military necessity.' It is hoped that foreign countries will not misunderstand, because the island has a base for transporting military supplies to China, enabling General Chiang Kai-shek to wage a long-term resistance."</p>

<h3>Our Army Counterattacks in Eastern Jin: Over 7,000 × Soldiers Fall into Disarray; Our Army Captures the Puppet Chief of Staff in Yongcheng</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] Our army counterattacks Heshun, taking Xiyang on the north road. Over 7,000 × soldiers have fallen into disarray. The battle situation in Hanwang Village is very fierce, and it has not stopped as of the 9th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The war situation in North China: Shandong is still fierce. Our army is launching large-scale guerrilla warfare from various places in the east, west, south, and north. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are sometimes cut off by us. It is reported that Feixian has been recovered. Linqing × is under our control and attack. We attacked Huimin, killing over a hundred × soldiers. The Ji-Cha × has been replaced and moved in many ways. There are still local fierce battles from time to time in various places in southwestern Shanxi. The river defense is consolidated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 10th] There are no changes on the front lines of Jingzao. Our army is still taking a monitoring posture. × has recently been continuously reinforcing Jingmen. Yesterday, 500 × soldiers from Songhe escorted over a hundred laborers to Jingmen. Seven to eight hundred × soldiers from Yingcheng also passed through Zaoshi to Jingmen yesterday, along with a artillery company. Currently, there are over a thousand × soldiers in Yongxing Village, southwest of Jingmen, forcibly recruiting laborers to rush to repair the Zaoshi to Tianmen highway, claiming that a large army will arrive soon to invade the west.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zaoyang, 10th] The × army in Yingshan and Anlu has recently withdrawn a portion back to Wuhan. As a result, the × army in the Yihe area has been constantly patrolling with tanks in recent days and firing artillery at us, making a show of force and feigning an attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 10th] After the puppet army Li Ying's troops opened from Shuiye to Anyang, they divided into three routes to attack Chuwang Town, Liuyuan, and other places in the east. They are currently being blocked and suppressed by our army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th] Military News: On the night of the 6th, a unit of our army launched a night attack on Shuangqiao Village, 18 miles southwest of Yongcheng (eastern Henan), the base of the puppet army Wang Fulai's troops. After a fierce battle of three hours, they were annihilated, and the puppet Chief of Staff Liu Fangong, battalion commanders Pang Yide and Wei Liangmin, and Wang Fulai's father, Wang Chaoshan, were captured alive.</p>
<p>Our Army Recovers Renqiu</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 10th] The × in Renqiu, after being constantly attacked by a certain division of our army for several days, were unable to support themselves and fled to Hejian on the 2nd. Our army immediately recovered Renqiu and attacked the × in Hejian at the same time. Until the 3rd, over three hundred × soldiers who had fled from Xianxian met with the × in Hejian, totaling over a thousand people, with more than ten artillery pieces. Together, they advanced towards our Dacaocun (west of Hejian) position, and released a large amount of poison gas. Although our officers and soldiers were poisoned, they continued to fight fiercely, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the × four or five times. After a fierce battle all morning on the 5th, they finally recaptured all the × positions. The remaining × retreated west to Hejian. In this battle, over three hundred × soldiers were killed, and over four hundred rifles, three light and heavy machine guns, and many military supplies were captured. We also suffered over a hundred casualties.</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week (Continued from the Second Edition)</h3>
<p>The crisis that is developing has been brought closer by the hypocritical compromising policies of Britain and France! As for the Spanish government forces, although they are encountering even greater dangers and the future of the war of resistance is even more difficult, they still have the possibility of a final victory over the × people. The first is because Spain is currently engaged in a strategic retreat, and it still has 500,000 elite troops who can continue to resist. The second is that Spain still possesses more than one-third of the country's vast territory, which can be used as a base for continuing resistance. The third is that all the Spanish people, including the people in the areas forcibly occupied by the fascist bandits, still support the democratic government. They are determined to fight against fascist aggression. The fourth is that the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world, in the Soviet Union, in the United States, in Britain and France, and even in Italy and Germany, are using various different forms of struggle to realize "Aid Spain!" The Western government also resolutely rejected British and French mediation and compromise, and the government moved to Valencia to continue the war, breaking the shameless rumors of the aggressors about the Western government and people not long ago, forcing Britain and France to show a little toughness towards Italy. If we can remember the poor Chinese Red Army of the past, who guarded the poor countryside of Jiangxi and were finally able to resist the continuous encirclement and suppression of large armies, we can believe that Spain is definitely not the Czech Republic, and Spain will definitely defeat the × people under the leadership of the People's Front with the Communist Party as the base.</p>
<p>The Trends of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Britain and France</p>
<p>The Spanish question has already pushed the world war crisis to the ignition point of total explosion. Europe, Africa, the Americas, and even the Sino-Japanese war cannot but be greatly affected. Now let's first look at Britain and France, the two countries directly affected. According to the facts of the past thirty months since the outbreak of the Spanish War of Resistance, we can prove that the ruling classes of Britain and France have always sympathized with the Western rebel army, and they even sympathize with the atrocities of the Italian and German aggressors in Spain. Based on the class interests of their own financial capital, they implemented a non-interference policy on the one hand, believing that they could stay out of the war, and could prevent the Soviet Union from aiding the Spanish government, and avoid the rise of the revolutionary wave in Europe; on the other hand, they condoned the military actions of the Italian and German aggressors in Spain, believing that after Italy and Germany conquered Spain, they would inevitably rely on the strength of Britain and France to carry out construction due to economic exhaustion, which would be a great opportunity to profit. Now Britain and France are eager to mediate the Spanish War, because they want to profit sooner. But how this will threaten Britain and France's own position in Europe, and even force Britain's Eurasian transportation to have to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope, is something that every British and French patriot sees in common. Therefore, the recent movement of the masses of people in the two countries against compromise diplomacy and against fascism has been raging like wildfire, becoming more and more intense day by day, and it is bound to become the main force in changing the policies of Britain and France.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Secondly, the victory of Italy and Germany in Spain also threatens the safety of South American countries and the interests of the United States. Therefore, in recent days, the United States has been chanting "Aid Spain!" and "Abolish the Neutrality Act!" President Roosevelt openly called for aiding democratic countries and resisting fascist aggression, winning the response of the Soviet government's severance of relations with Hungary as a fact of striking aggressors, and also winning the response of the British Prime Minister and the French Foreign Minister one after another. Even the speech of the aggression ringleader Mussolini on the 4th was kept secret and not published. This policy of the United States against aggression and upholding peace is obviously the result of the mad actions of the Japanese, German, and Italian aggressors harming the United States, and it is certainly the preliminary success of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement of the American people, especially the vast number of working masses.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>This result also helped the unity of the forces of peace and democracy, especially the Soviet government was able to smoothly promote its policy of maintaining peace and protecting national independence. In Europe, the Soviet Union is preparing to launch a treaty on the Black Sea, based on the three countries of the Black Sea coast, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, and invite Greece to participate, to establish a collective security system and prevent Germany from advancing eastward again. In the Far East, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japanese aggressors has also become tougher. On the one hand, it resolutely rejected Japan's unreasonable demands regarding the maritime treaty, and on the other hand, it actively strengthened its Far Eastern preparedness. It is particularly noteworthy that on the 6th and 7th of this month, Japanese troops attacked Island No. 227 on the Erguna River in the upper reaches of the Soviet Union's Heilongjiang River and were eventually repelled by Soviet troops. The Soviet Union has lodged a serious protest with Japan, and the situation on the Soviet border has become tense again. The manifestation of the Soviet Union's power in the Far East not only restrained the Japanese defense forces that had been lingering for thousands of miles in our country, but also attacked the Southward and Westward plans of Britain, France, and the United States. It can be seen that "The Soviet Union is a pillar of world peace" is by no means a slogan! An impossible fantasy.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Youths in Our Country Demonstrate in Western Shanghai; Distribute Leaflets and Shout Slogans; Open Fire and Attack the Puppet Police Station</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai Dispatch: At about 9:00 a.m. on the 10th, five young men from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Assassination Group suddenly appeared near the triangle of Caojiadu in Western Shanghai, each holding a Mauser pistol and hand grenades, parading and demonstrating, and shouting slogans such as "Kill all traitors and recover lost land." Then they went to the front of the puppet police station and opened fire more than ten times with Mauser pistols, and threw a hand grenade. At that time, the puppet police guarding the station all fled in panic and did not dare to go out. The doors and windows of the station were broken. After completing their mission, the five young men dispersed to other places.</p>
<h3>College Graduates: An Opportunity to Devote Themselves to Serving the Country; Take the National Military Training Instructor Exam; Chen Cheng Sends a Letter to the Ministry of Education Ordering All Schools</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] The Education Department of the Hubei Provincial Government stated that the number of primary and secondary school teachers from the war zones inside and outside the province scattered in various counties of the province is increasing day by day, and work supervision is quite difficult. It is specially organizing a "Wartime Education Personnel Hubei Service Group." All teachers from middle schools in the war zone, teachers from primary schools in the war zone who have not been assigned work, surplus teachers hired in the province, and teachers from the war zone who have withdrawn from the province who have been registered and qualified should report and participate. A number of teams will be formed according to the actual number of people, and the service group measures promulgated by the Ministry will be followed, and the actual situation in the province will be considered.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Newspapers: Promote Xenophobia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, August 8th] Tokyo Dispatch: Local newspapers have recently published a lot of xenophobic texts. This type of text opposes Japan's intentions towards the great powers. All newspapers believe that the recent speech by Navy Minister Yonai in the Diet to expand the navy explained that Japan is also able to compete with the military preparations of Britain, the United States, and other great powers. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that US President Roosevelt is currently conspiring to aid the Soviet Union against Japan. The Mainichi Shimbun criticized Britain and France for aiding China, saying that the opposition between the British and French lines and the Italian and German lines is natural, but the United States should not intervene. The Asahi Shimbun advocated a tough stance against the Soviet Union on the fishing issue.</p>
<h3>× Side × Forges Central Bank Banknotes; Transported to Occupied Areas; Forcing the Public to Use Them</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The Japanese side has recently forged Central Bank banknotes, transported them to the occupied areas, and forced the public to use them. The central government has recently ordered local authorities and chambers of commerce to strictly prevent this, so as to avoid the public being deceived.</p>
<h3>Kunming Elementary School Students: Charity Sale Achieves Satisfactory Results; Over 20,000 Yuan Raised</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Issues a Circular to the Whole Country: Unifying the Standard for Foreign Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance has unified the standard for foreign exchange settlement and issued a circular to the whole country, stating that foreign exchange will be calculated at the legal price from now on. Yunnan has also set a date to implement it next month.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Clothing for New Recruits: Regulations Stipulated by the Ministry of Military Administration</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th, Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Military Administration has been ordered to stipulate supplementary clothing regulations for recruits and new recruits in each province, and has telegraphed to all military districts, setting a deadline to complete the supplies by mid-February. Those who fail to implement this will be punished for deducting military pay and mistreating soldiers.</p>
<h3>How to Overcome the Current Difficulties</h3>
<p>……Expectations for Overseas Chinese……</p>
<p>[Manuscript from the National Salvation Society] On the day when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee was held, our supreme leader gave us a very precise analysis of the overall situation of the War of Resistance in his opening remarks. The leader revealed to us that "If we recognize ourselves, recognize the × people, and recognize the inevitability of the development of the environment and things, then we can understand the number of successes and failures." The inevitable defeat of × and the inevitable victory of our country, this situation has already been determined; but if we want to strive for the glorious final victory, there are still many difficulties along the way. Therefore, the leader said: "First, we should use our unity and solidarity to deal with the arrogance and disorder of the × people, and to overcome the enemy from below; second, we should give full play to the special characteristic of our agricultural country of being thrifty and persevering, and deepen the weakness of the × people's industrial country; third, we should use our advantages of favorable climate and geographical location, step up all wartime construction, and promote the crisis of the collapse of ×'s society; fourth, we should truly practice the Three Principles of the People and overthrow the militarism of the × people."</p>
<p>In the past year, the unity within the country has reached a degree that ×× could not have imagined. All of the × people's provocations and discord have failed. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the army and civilians across the country are united in good faith and fighting to realize the new China of the Three Principles of the People. This unity has been further strengthened as the war enters a new stage. This can be known by simply looking at the rapid strengthening of forces in the military, political, economic, and cultural fields. Glorious victory is just around the corner, and this is what we can report to our compatriots who live abroad and are struggling hard with joyful and inspiring hearts.</p>
<p>But on the one hand, we must recognize the difficulties of the × people to strengthen our confidence in victory, but at the same time, we must also recognize that there are still difficulties existing in ourselves, and use all possible efforts to overcome them.</p>
<p>The difficulties currently faced by the × people, as the leader said in his opening remarks at the Fifth Plenary Session, cannot be overcome. But our difficulties are entirely dependent on whether we have the belief that we will win the War of Resistance, and whether we are willing to sacrifice ourselves to overcome these difficulties. Because our difficulties are all difficulties in terms of enjoyment, and they are temporary. The Chairman has given very clear instructions on this point, saying that those in front should take the lives of soldiers as the standard, and those in the rear should take the lives of ordinary people as the standard. This is a creed that every patriotic compatriot should follow very carefully in their personal lives.</p>
<p>We are a country with backward industries. Since the War of Resistance, we have lost some important seaports and cities, and we have also lost some transportation routes. Naturally, people feel a lot of inconvenience in their lives. But these inconveniences in personal life are precisely the reason for promoting national progress. When the seaports are lost, we can get rid of the shackles of foreign goods and put the old and new industries in the interior in a state of protection without competition. China is currently in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rid of ××'s economy.</p>
<p>In the country, for the victory of the War of Resistance, whether in the front or in the rear, a thrift campaign is being vigorously carried out, and the creed of reducing living standards has been earnestly implemented. Strict rules have also been set for those who do not follow this creed and are indulgent and unrestrained. We believe that in the iron fire training of this holy war, we will definitely be able to completely burn away all the bad habits that our nation has always had!</p>
<p>Now, we can't help but think of the compatriots fighting for the country overseas. The hard work, perseverance, thrift, and generosity of our overseas compatriots are well known to the world. Therefore, overseas compatriots are the pioneers of our domestic compatriots in reducing living standards and practicing thrift. However, recently, since the War of Resistance, a decadent atmosphere has emerged in Hong Kong, the Shanghai Concession, and some other places. Regarding this point, we are here to convey the news from the country. We hope that the vast majority of struggling compatriots can arouse the attention of the few compatriots who are accustomed to enjoying life in the place of residence, exercise self-restraint, and save useful gold and goods for long-term ×× and increased production. The Chairman's words, "Using our advantages of favorable climate and geographical location, stepping up all wartime construction," we hope that overseas compatriots will bravely take on this responsibility.</p>
<p>When this short article meets our overseas compatriots, it may be the lunar New Year. We would like to convey to you the news that the motherland is thriving and getting stronger in the war, as a happy New Year's message. At the same time, we hope that our compatriots will be as thrifty as possible in the difficult New Year, and use the money saved from unnecessary expenses to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and the wounded soldiers in the rear, as your New Year's gifts to them.</p>

<h3>Italy Announces Accelerated Military Preparations Supreme National Defense Council Holds Meeting France Also Discusses North African Defenses</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] The Italian Supreme National Defense Council held its fourth regular meeting of the season yesterday at the Palazzo Venezia.</p>
<p>Presided over by Prime Minister Mussolini, the meeting discussed various construction plans that began on the 6th of this month. It is reported that the content includes revisions to various laws and regulations on national military organization, civilian and industrial, and economic mobilization.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] With the existence of a true Anglo-French military alliance, Italy has announced accelerated defense preparations. It is reported that the authorities have ordered reserve officers to enlist. The Diplomatic and Political Correspondence published an article today in response to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement, stating that although the Anglo-French alliance is for self-defense, Italy should not be confused by the word "self-defense." It is widely rumored that Italy, due to French troop movements in Tunisia, has also concentrated 50,000 to 80,000 troops in certain areas. Prime Minister Mussolini will hold a third meeting with the Defense Committee this Tuesday and has scheduled a National Defense Conference for Friday, lasting three days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] The Italian political and diplomatic newspaper Corriere della Sera today disclosed various news items regarding Italy's accelerated military preparations. According to the newspaper's correspondent in London, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement is not enough to change Italy's established policy. Foreign Minister Ciano's newspaper, Il Telegrafo, stated, "We acknowledge that the Anglo-French military alliance was promoted by various fascist circles, and we also acknowledge that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States intend to end the Axis. However, we can already discern the final outcome of the current crisis. This outcome will lead to a major restructuring of the world."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] The French Senate Defense Committee held a closed-door meeting yesterday. It is reported that the meeting discussed issues related to the defense of the North African coast. Naval Minister Campinchi declared that the execution of the naval plan has been very successful and is progressing rapidly, and that the situation of the navy has improved compared to last year.

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 9th] Today, the government issued a notice to the whole country, summoning reservists of the 1906 and 1907 classes for training. The official announcement claimed that this summons has no special significance and is "proceeding as usual." These two classes of reservists had previously not received training due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. This treaty has now been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th] A large number of young men here are being conscripted into the army or engaged in labor, resulting in a considerable shortage of labor. As a result, laundries have decided to implement austerity measures, switching to washing once a week for regular customers and generally refusing new customers.</p>
<h3>Rebel Troops Reach French Border Completely Occupy Le Perthus Rebel Troops Also Land on Minorca</h3>
<p>Major Powers Begin to Compete for Position in Spain</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] As the Spanish government forces debate whether to surrender or continue the war, European powers are beginning to compete for positions in Spain. Governments are attempting to gain advantages through words, coercion, intimidation, and persuasion. The recent secret mission of the British warship "Devonshire" to Minorca was intended to negotiate the handover of the island as a basis for diplomatic mediation in the war. In Paris, the French parliament also secretly convened to discuss strengthening national defense. The Italian authorities convened the third National Defense Conference, and Germany mobilized reserves. The Soviet Union also intends to sign a Black Sea agreement with related countries to obtain guarantees for its sphere of influence. These are all forms of power struggles among the major powers. The United Kingdom and France have intensified negotiations on the Spanish war in an attempt to achieve a diplomatic victory. It is understood that the British warship "Devonshire" is now hurrying to Marseille. It is reported that the ship has not returned to Mallorca, which proves that Mr. Sanluis, the governor of Mallorca, who took a warship to Marseille for a meeting, has now arrived in Mallorca. It is generally believed that Mr. Sanluis declared that Minorca should only be garrisoned by Spanish troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Le Perthus, 9th] Spanish rebel troops arrived here at 10:45 this morning and raised the rebel flag. Government ministers and other leaders had left beforehand, including Prime Minister Negrín, Foreign Minister Del Vayo, Chief of Staff General Rojo, and many other staff officers.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Toulouse, 9th] It is reported that Spanish Prime Minister Negrín arrived here at 6 PM via private plane from Pamiers. His whereabouts are extremely secret, and confirmation is impossible. However, the airport in this town was indeed under heavy police guard for a time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Le Perthus, 9th] The occupation of the Spanish part of Le Perthus by Spanish rebel troops has shocked the military authorities here, as government troops were still passing through the town safely in trucks just ten minutes earlier. The town is now completely occupied by rebel troops, without a shot fired. Three rebel flags are flying on the Franco-Spanish border, and the original government flags have been torn down. Three rebel generals are walking slowly on the streets, and citizens are hanging rebel flags from their windows and cheering. The rebel generals shook hands with the French commander defending the French border. The rebel troops shouted "Long live France!" and "France and Spain are brothers!" The rebel advance has plunged the citizens here into great confusion. The houses within the Spanish border are uninhabited, as the armed personnel crowded inside have all fled into the French border. Afterwards, the streets were quiet, with French troops guarding every fifty yards.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 9th] Spanish rebel troops have occupied San Juan de las Abadesas, an industrial town fifteen miles from the border.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 9th] It has just been announced here that Spanish rebel troops landed today in Ciudadela on the west coast of Minorca and joined up with local guards who support the rebellion. Many government military leaders have fled, and the island is almost entirely in the hands of the rebels. The landing force consisted of two infantry battalions, one artillery company, and their support units. The rebels have also redeployed a division from Barcelona to the island.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Reuters' foreign affairs correspondent, discussing the Spanish rebels' demand to control Minorca (one of the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean), pointed out that France is particularly concerned about the future of the island, as its occupation by an enemy would greatly threaten communication between France and its North African territories. Both the United Kingdom and France demand that the occupation of the island be managed solely by Spain. The British government's dispatch of an envoy aboard the cruiser "Devonshire" to discuss the peaceful surrender of the island with General Franco aims to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The cruiser "Devonshire" left Minorca yesterday, carrying 450 refugees. It has been learned here that Colonel Sanluis, the rebel commander of Mallorca, arrived in Minorca yesterday aboard the "Devonshire." British officials stated that the British government dispatched the "Devonshire" at the request of the rebel authorities to transport Colonel Sanluis. It is still unknown whether Colonel Sanluis has left the island again.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] According to newspapers here, General Miaja, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish government forces, is consulting with General Franco in central Spain on the issue of a ceasefire. "Le Matin" also reported that, according to reliable sources, General Miaja has decided to abandon continued resistance. It is said that this decision was encouraged by the British and French governments, who intend to recognize the Franco government and are therefore advocating for reconciliation with Miaja. "Le Journal" stated that the Spanish Republican government has begun negotiations with the Franco government on the surrender of Madrid and the cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The Spanish Embassy in France has denied that France and Spain are currently holding talks to discuss ending the Spanish war and signing a ceasefire agreement.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet to Recognize Rebel Government in Spain Italy Also Discusses Spanish Affairs</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] The French cabinet meeting, originally scheduled for the 11th, has been postponed to the 14th due to new developments in the Spanish situation. It is generally believed that the French government hopes to resolve the current diplomatic dilemma in which the country finds itself, and hopes that by the 14th, it will be able to remove the last obstacles preventing the dispatch of a French envoy to the Spanish rebel zone. Furthermore, sources close to the French Foreign Ministry have refused to discuss the possibility of joint Anglo-French mediation in the Spanish conflict.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Well-informed political circles believe that the French government will decide to recognize the Franco government at the cabinet meeting, but certain conditions must be met, the most important of which is the withdrawal of the Italian army from Spain. Left-wing figures believe that the French government is preparing to recognize the rebel government based on Franco's agreement to withdraw Italian troops, without demanding any guarantees. At the same time, the British and French governments are maintaining close contact and coordination on this issue.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] Yesterday afternoon, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Ambassador Coulondre, the ambassador to Berlin. It is reported that the French ambassador conveyed to Bonnet the conversation he had with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and special information from the German Foreign Minister. It is generally believed that this meeting was related to the Spanish issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Responsible sources have stated that the US government has no intention of recognizing the Franco government in Spain at this time. The issue of recognition will not be considered until Franco has control over the majority of Spanish territory and the Republican government has completely surrendered. It is generally believed that the end of the Spanish war is still far off and has only reached its most critical stage.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 9th] The Italian Fascist Grand Council will hold its second meeting tomorrow. It is expected that not much discussion will be devoted to foreign affairs, as the previous meeting discussed them extensively. However, the Spanish issue, especially Minorca, will be discussed. It is anticipated that no sensational communiqué will be issued.</p>
<h3>Schacht to Tour the World</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 10th] It is reported that Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, the former president of the German Reichsbank, will embark on a private world tour during the day.</p>
<h3>Jones Praises China's Credit in US House of Representatives $25 Million Loan Stipulated Not to Purchase Arms</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), reported today to the House Banking and Currency Committee on the situation of the RFC, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the Export-Import Bank. He stated that he is confident that China will be able to repay the $25 million it borrowed from the United States. Jones said, "I know China is willing to pay off its debts, and I also express my trust in the integrity and honesty of the Chinese people." Members of the House Banking and Currency Committee then inquired whether the $25 million loan was or would be used to purchase arms. Jones replied in the negative, stating that the agreement stipulates that this loan cannot be used to purchase arms. Jones further stated that he has no intention of providing loans to China at present. According to the law, he cannot do so. This loan is guaranteed by China, and as the bank is semi-governmental, the United States has loaned money to the Chinese government, and China will certainly be able to pay on time. China's repayment of debts is very creditworthy, and my view of the Chinese people is also very good.</p>
<h3>Britain Boycotts Japanese Goods Passes Additional Import Duty Act Retaliating Against Japan's Disregard of Far Eastern Interests</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The British House of Commons passed an additional import duty act yesterday, targeting Japanese steel products. Opposition Labour MP Mr. Baker said that the government's claim that this measure would reduce the sale of Japanese goods is the least credible reason. Mr. Cross, who proposed the bill, said that the reason we want to exclude Japanese goods is because Japanese goods are manufactured by exploited labor, and that this action is to retaliate against Japan's disregard of British general interests in the Far East. We should be even more sympathetic to this bill and said that we previously advocated a united international exclusion of Japanese goods and hope that the government will also support this move.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the quantity of frozen eggs produced in China and exported has fluctuated from time to time, and the impact has been that the market price is extremely unstable.

<h3>Pope Pius XI of Rome Dies of Heart Attack Testament States There Is Still Work to Be Completed Successor to the Pope is Bishop of Chieti</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] Pope Pius XI of Rome died at 4:31 AM (Greenwich Mean Time) this morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] Pope Pius XI suffered a sudden heart attack yesterday, with his heart beating rapidly twice in one day. His condition worsened in the evening. When his heart failed for the second time at 8 PM, he was unable to speak. His attendants were quite worried. Although no official report on his condition was released, it is understood that the Pope suffered from cardiac asthma and inflammation of the bronchial tubes. After each heart failure, he was unconscious for more than half an hour. The Pope has now been moved to a bed, and his condition is extremely dangerous. The successor to the Pope, Bishop Chieti of Milan, arrived here last night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The serious illness of the Pope of Rome has caused concern in all quarters. The Pope's attendants said that the Pope deeply hoped to deliver an address to 200 Italian bishops this Saturday. His strong desire to do so may prolong his life. The Pope has been seriously ill for several years and has repeatedly given up hope of recovery.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] According to semi-official sources, the last words of Pope Pius XI were, "We still have some work that needs to be completed." Those standing by the Pope's bedside said, "The Pope was still conscious at the time of his death and automatically tilted his head on the pillow."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] After the death of Pope Pius XI of Rome, the publication of newspapers here was advanced by four hours compared to normal, with three or four pages of mourning texts. People everywhere are discussing the Pope's death. Thousands of people went to the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. All government agencies and public buildings are flying flags at half-mast to express mourning. This Sunday, St. Peter's Basilica will hold a 10th-anniversary celebration of the agreement between the Pope and the King. King Emmanuel and Prime Minister Mussolini will send representatives to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] After the death of Pope Pius XI, people across Italy expressed grief. Pius was born on May 31, 1857, with the childhood name of Achille Ratti. His father, Francesco Ratti, was the manager of a silk factory. After graduating from the St. Charles College in Milan, Achille was guided by the Bishop of Milan and sent to the Lombard College in Rome for further study. He was ordained as a priest on December 20, 1879, and three years later became a professor of theology at a university. In 1912, he was summoned to Rome as the Deputy Director of the Vatican Library. In 1919, he was promoted to Papal Nuncio to Poland and Archbishop of Lepanto. When the Communist uprising in Poland occurred, he remained in Warsaw. On January 22, 1922, after the death of Pope Benedict XV, Achille Ratti was elected as Pope, taking the name Pius XI. Since then, he has devoted himself to Church affairs, eliminating various obstacles between the Church and the government, and signing Church agreements with Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, and Germany.</p>
<p>Note: Pope Pius XI of Rome, aged 82, was born in 1857 in a rural village in the territory of Milan, Italy. After growing up, he worked as a manager in the Vatican Library. Because of his intelligence and fluency in more than 20 languages, he spoke in English with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax during a meeting last month. During the Great War, he was the Papal Nuncio to Warsaw. In 1919, he was promoted to Archbishop of Lepanto, and the following year he was appointed Archbishop of Milan. In 1922, after the death of the previous Pope, he was elected to succeed as Pope. During his pontificate, his greatest achievement was resolving the Roman Question with the Italian government. He was a staunch anti-communist and therefore strongly supported the rebels in the Spanish Civil War. He was also very concerned about the Sino-Japanese War, as it greatly affected the affairs of the Shinto Church in Liaodong. Pius XI was the 260th Pope of the Holy Roman Catholic Church and currently has 400 million followers.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Cherishing Talent!</h3>
<p>In order to strive for the complete liberation of the Chinese nation, no Chinese sons and daughters should be abandoned outside the cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction! Furthermore, no specialized talents should be abandoned outside the cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This newspaper's special dispatch from Chongqing on the 10th states that Minister of Political Affairs Chen Cheng sent a letter to the Ministry of Education, which was then forwarded to all specialized schools above the college level, stating that graduates who do not yet have employment may be permitted to apply to become military training instructors in the National Army, and that all procedures will be waived, etc. General Chen's order can be seen as a major indication of the authorities' cherishing of talent, and we should support it with both hands.</p>
<p>However, we still cannot fail to point out that in the nineteen months since the War of Resistance, although our country's politics has made considerable progress, and specialized talents from all fields have repeatedly been given opportunities by the government to display their strengths, the efforts and advocacy of the highest leaders in this regard are especially moving, but mid-level and lower-level leaders still fail to faithfully implement them. As a result, corrupt and incompetent individuals, conservative and stubborn elements, and opportunists who take advantage of the times are still able to muddle along in positions of authority, while patriotic, responsible, and nationally conscious youth, experts with rich experience, knowledge, and noble character, and talented individuals with the determination to resist the war and prestige among the masses are still mostly idle and discarded, or even destitute and displaced, unable to fulfill their national duty even if they desire to do so. Other instances of talent being buried in trivial tasks, and incompetent officials holding high positions, are particularly common everywhere. At this turning point in the nation's destiny, we sincerely hope that the authorities will build on their achievements and take a further step, eradicating the remnants of feudalism, strictly prohibiting partisan prejudices, and ensuring that all talents in the country are given opportunities to apply their skills and abilities to the fullest. At the same time, we also hope that those who are lamenting their misfortune of not being recognized for their talents will not remain aloof and self-admiring, blaming others and the world. Those who have the opportunity to dedicate themselves to the country and the people and can display their talents should step forward enthusiastically and set an example for the masses.</p>
<p>Finally, we should be aware that the cause of national liberation has only just begun to show a glimmer of light, and the future is fraught with difficulties and hardships that may be beyond our imagination. Even with the full mobilization of national talents, there may not be enough to cope with the arduous tasks ahead. Therefore, we must promptly and properly prohibit certain localities from persecuting capable youth due to partisan prejudices, and a small number of individuals from inciting internal divisions under the pretext of anti-communism based on personal biases. Otherwise, it would be a great disservice to the authorities' great intention of cherishing talent, sharing national difficulties, and saving the nation!</p>
<h3>"The Most Wonderful Program"</h3>
<p>The local ZKW broadcasting station broadcast last night a piece of news from London about the Spanish "Civil War." The sound of marching soldiers and vehicles could be faintly heard. It is said that residents who heard this news on the radio considered it the most wonderful program since the establishment of radio stations in Hong Kong. We hope that those who hear this kind of wonderful program in the future should take a few minutes to:</p>
<p>(1) Think about how the Spanish democratic government and its people are fighting for their country's freedom and world peace. How are they, under the ravages and massacres of the German and Italian aggressor armies, and under the hypocritical betrayal of weak democratic countries, helping us to resist and weaken Japanese aggression?</p>
<p>(2) Hearing the broadcasting of the Spanish war from thousands of miles away should make us think even more about how, just dozens or hundreds of miles away from us, the war of Japanese ×× and their aggression against our motherland is being staged. What is being ravaged and massacred is our farmland and homes, and our elders, relatives, and friends!</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is approaching soon. Do not let the sounds of firecrackers, laughter, and lewdness cover up these wonderful programs! Do not deprive yourselves of a chance for the best blessing! We must use donations, participation in the "One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement," and participation in the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees to bless the health and victory of our motherland and our Western comrades!</p>

<h3>Smuggling Across the Sino-British Border Becomes Increasingly Active; Kowloon Customs Expands Armed Anti-Smuggling Team; Large Quantities of Tungsten Ore, Silver, and Copper Coins from Occupied Areas are Smuggled into Hong Kong; Tungsten Ore Exported East Reaches Over 1,500 Tons in the Past Ten Days Alone</h3>
<p>Since the change in the situation in South China, smugglers who only see profit have become very active, colluding with × people to search for military raw materials, mainly tungsten, and scrap copper and iron in the countryside, smuggling them into Hong Kong in large quantities, selling them to × merchants, concentrating them for export to the East. For more than three months, these smuggled goods have been arriving continuously. Recently, it has become even more rampant, and under the instigation of × people, they have even started to collect silver and copper coins, hoping to disrupt our country's financial structure. After the anti-smuggling network on the Sino-British border in Kowloon and Shenzhen resumed its work, the authorities, seeing the increasing rampancy of smugglers, planned to expand the anti-smuggling force to take meticulous preventative measures on both land and water along the Sino-British border. However, smugglers are cunning and have the protection of × people, so they have not been deterred in the slightest, and continue to smuggle rampantly. Large quantities of tungsten ore, silver, copper coins, and scrap copper and iron are still being smuggled out.</p>
<p>Strengthening Forces, Intensifying Anti-Smuggling Efforts</p>
<p>According to news from Kowloon Customs yesterday, the authorities are aware of the increasing activity of smugglers, so they have decided to make a large-scale expansion of the anti-smuggling force on the Sino-British border in Shenzhen. After careful planning, a detailed plan has been completed and submitted to the Central Ministry of Finance and the Inspector General of Customs for approval, and implementation has begun in sequence. The main focus is to increase the number of personnel in the anti-smuggling team. Currently, two special anti-smuggling teams and three bicycle anti-smuggling teams have been organized. The members of each team are also equipped with new weapons to give them sufficient ability to deal with smugglers at any time. Recently, it is planned to organize several machine gun teams to join the anti-smuggling efforts. Currently, the Customs authorities have ordered border anti-smuggling detectives to intensify their work, in addition to constant day and night patrols, and to cooperate with village self-defense groups and the people along the border to investigate smuggling. In late last month, with the help of villagers, more than 20 smuggling cases were uncovered, and several hundred tons of tungsten ore were intercepted. At the same time, in order to achieve quick results, the Hong Kong Customs anti-smuggling officers will also cooperate to find clues and indirectly uncover the Chinese border agencies and routes.</p>
<p>Smugglers Advance on Land and Sea</p>
<p>According to those who know the inside story of smuggling, the most common routes for smugglers to export are the land and water routes on the Sino-British border. They have many accomplices and are exceptionally well-informed, often making it difficult for customs officers to cope. They have fixed goods storage agencies in villages near the Sino-British border, where they first transport the goods collected from the countryside in the mainland to the Chinese border village agencies, and then take the opportunity to transport them into the British border for storage, and then hire trucks or local people to transport them to Hong Kong. This is the situation of land smuggling. As for water smuggling, it is mostly carried out by cargo boats, which take the opportunity to cross the British border from the Chinese border and transport them directly to Hong Kong. The most active areas for smugglers are the seas bordering Castle Peak and Baoan, and the Dapeng area is also their lair. The Customs anti-smuggling force's scope of influence only extends to the Chinese border, so once smugglers' goods are transferred to the British border, there is nothing that can be done, and they can calmly transport them to their destination.</p>
<p>The Amount of Tungsten Ore Exported is Astounding</p>
<p>According to investigations, the largest category of goods smuggled into Hong Kong is tungsten ore, and the profits are also the highest. Every 100 catties can often earn dozens of dollars in profit. The next largest category is silver and copper coins, which also have significant profits to be made. Although the central government has been buying silver, there is still a huge amount of silver used and collected by the people in the countryside. Copper coins are even more commonly used as auxiliary currency. They are now urgently seeking to absorb our silver and copper coins to disrupt our financial economy. They are intensifying their efforts in the occupied areas and are enticing smugglers to collect silver from the countryside in our mainland. After collecting the silver, they melt it into ingots of various sizes before smuggling it into Hong Kong. Copper coins are stored in wooden boxes and straw bags for smuggling. Once they arrive at their destination, they are bought by × merchants at high prices, and then exported to the East in batches. According to investigations by reporters, in the past ten days, three batches of sand, totaling more than 1,500 tons, have been moved from a certain ×× street and ×× store to a certain ship anchored on the ×× sea, and over 300 bags of copper coins have been hired to be transported to the seaside at night and transferred to a ship, approximately every four or five days, a batch is transported to a certain ship for export to the East, and this has been uninterrupted for the past two or three months.</p>
<h3>Hai Long Sailing Ship Returns to Port After Encountering a Hurricane Immediately After Leaving Port; Will Cross the Ocean Again in Ten Days</h3>
<p>Boatswain Harry Bolton and eleven companions recently sailed from Hong Kong in the Chinese sailing ship Hai Long, intending to make the grand journey across the Pacific to America. However, after sailing for several days, not far from Keelung, a storm suddenly arose. The ship's engine was not suitable for long-distance navigation, and because crew member Potter was seriously ill, they decided to return to port. They arrived at 11:10 pm last night (the 11th) and immediately sent Potter to the European War Memorial Hospital for treatment. According to Bolton's statement to reporters, although his companions have suffered setbacks, their ambitions have not been extinguished and they will continue their second voyage. The ship is currently being repaired and should be able to cross the ocean again in ten days. Potter has decided to stay in Hong Kong for treatment and will no longer depart with the group.</p>
<h3>Chen Lianbo Promotes Guangxi Mining Industry; Personally Supervises Workers After the War of Resistance to Work Hard; Rumors of Returning to Hong Kong for Medical Treatment a Month Ago are Untrue</h3>
<p>Chen Lianbo has been managing gold mines in Guangxi in recent years and has achieved considerable success. Several months ago, he contracted malignant malaria in Guangxi and returned to Hong Kong to be treated by doctors Ye Dazhen and Hu Huide. He was bedridden for several months and has only recently recovered. Evil people have taken this opportunity to spread various rumors in an attempt to undermine and divide the unity of the War of Resistance. Those with discernment know that their plan will not succeed. Yesterday, reporters met with Mr. Chen and asked about the industrial situation in Guangxi Province. According to him, since the War of Resistance, the mining industry in Guangxi Province has continued to advance as usual. The only difficulty is that the implementation of conscription in Guangxi Province has made it slightly difficult to recruit workers. At present, our country has decided to persist in the War of Resistance and especially to develop agriculture as soon as possible to increase production and strengthen the War of Resistance, which can also be used to settle refugees, achieving two goals at once. Therefore, the Guangxi Provincial Government pays special attention to promoting the agricultural and mining industries in the province. Since the War of Resistance, I have personally gone to the mines to supervise the workers, encouraging them to work bravely and normally to increase national income and fulfill a citizen's duty. Mr. Chen also stated that during the "January 28th" Nineteenth Route Army's War of Resistance in Shanghai, he raised funds in Hong Kong to support the Nineteenth Route Army, and as chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, he worked hard to provide relief to refugees. Last year, his friend Chen Jintao was used by × people to act as a puppet in the Nanjing puppet organization. Mr. Lianbo once sent a telegram to severely rebuke him. This letter was published in the newspapers at the time, which shows his character.</p>
<h3>Two Major Armed Robberies Occur in Kowloon and the New Territories; Robbery in a House in Ho Sheung Heung Results in Loss of Over Two Thousand Yuan; Revenue Collectors Robbed on the Road in Yau Ma Tei</h3>
<p>The rampancy of bandits has been shocking and horrifying. Those responsible for maintaining law and order have paid attention, but it is impossible to prevent everything. Yesterday morning, between 12:45 AM and 1:00 AM, two robbery cases occurred in succession in the New Territories and Yau Ma Tei, resulting in significant losses. The details of the robberies are recorded below:</p>
<p>Breaking in Through the Roof</p>
<p>In an unnumbered house in Ho Sheung Heung, New Territories, a young woman named Hou Jinsheng and her husband, Mr. Liu, lived together. The Liu couple made a living by farming and had some savings, which made them the target of bandits. At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Madam Hou was fast asleep when she heard the sound of tiles being removed. She quickly got out of bed and listened quietly, and lit a lamp to see what was happening. Before long, she saw a hole open and heard someone jumping down. She then saw seven bandits come down from the attic, one holding a sharp sword and one holding a pistol, and they began to threaten Madam Hou.</p>
<p>Entering in the Dark, Exiting in the Light</p>
<p>One bandit kept watch over her, while the rest searched the house thoroughly. About an hour later, they left shouting and hurriedly. When the bandits left, they exited through the front door and locked it from the outside to prevent Madam Hou from reporting the crime. Afterwards, Madam Hou managed to open the door and arrived at the police station at 3:00 AM to report the crime. According to Madam Hou, the bandits robbed her of HK$1,100, CN$900, six gold rings worth $48, three gold butterflies and 344 pieces of coral pearl jewelry worth $175, and one gold-inlaid jade bracelet worth $40, one pair of rattan bracelets worth $25.</p>
<p>Robbing Revenue Collectors</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Qiu Rong, the owner of Yiu Kwong Mirror Shop, went to Sham Shui Po the day before yesterday to collect old debts from customers, totaling $280. Mr. Qiu returned home late at night. When he passed near Pak Street and Jordan Road in Yau Ma Tei, he was suddenly rushed out of a building by three bandits. One bandit pointed a gun at him and ordered him to hand over the money, otherwise he would be killed. Under the threat, Mr. Qiu was forced to obey, as the night was late and quiet and he was afraid of being harmed if he shouted. The bandits fled after getting their hands on the money. Mr. Qiu then went to the police station to report the crime.</p>
<h3>Flying Hotel Scheduled to Arrive in Hong Kong on March 1; No Passengers on the Initial Round Trip</h3>

<h3>Saving Money for Donations and Group Travel; Spending the Lunar New Year in a New Way; Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Amateur Social Club and Others Advocate</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhuo</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, the custom of celebrating "Lunar New Year" is still deeply rooted, and habits cannot be changed overnight. ——This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>It is said that in Hong Kong, the customs and habits of the Lunar New Year are extremely elaborate, labor-intensive, and costly, and cannot be compared with those of other places. If the world were peaceful and the economy were prosperous, it would be forgivable to have a carnival after a year of hard work. However, this New Year's Day is descending upon the world amidst the flames of war and the wails of refugees. Can we still bear to follow the old customs, burn the firecrackers of New Year's Eve in vain, and waste valuable wealth at will? This is a serious question that is worth our careful reflection.</p>
<p>If we are not blind, we can see how the 800,000 newly arrived compatriots in Hong Kong came to be; if we are not deaf, we can hear what kind of life our compatriots are living after half of our motherland has fallen; if we have thoughts, we can also understand who gave us our suffering. In the face of this serious misfortune, looking at the afflicted compatriots and thinking about our future, who can bear to indulge in pleasure as in the past?</p>
<p>According to custom, we must drive away the entanglement of "evil spirits" and pray for the blessing of "gods" during the Lunar New Year. From the blood-like lessons, we have realized that the greatest evil spirit is the Japanese warlords; the only thing that can truly protect us is the nation! Since the fall of Guangzhou, the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have experienced this conceptualized theory with 120,000 points of sincerity. The auspicious words that are mutually blessed on New Year's Day can only be realized when the War of Resistance is won, and there can be no luck.</p>
<p>In response to this fact, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has launched a campaign to promote a thrift movement for the Lunar New Year, which is clearly a very meaningful and urgent task at present. It is reported that the association has drafted a small notice and measures, printed in the form of invitations, and distributed to all trades and businesses for unified implementation. The main points are: The dates of the Lunar New Year thrift movement are from December 20th of the year of Wuyin to January 16th of the year of Jimao. The funds saved will be used entirely for the relief of war refugees and will be paid by January 16th. This simple invitation is printed in pink and lists the types of savings in addition to the small notice and measures, which are to be filled in by the savers themselves.</p>
<p>Any compatriot with a little bit of blood will feel deeply gratified after hearing this news, and pray that it will expand like wildfire.</p>
<p>This is a gratifying and comforting piece of information. Yesterday, when reporters met with Mr. Wang Junheng of the Hong Kong Amateur Social Club, they learned that the Amateur Social Club also responded to this thrift movement and proposed measures to contribute to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce for adoption. In order to spread this movement to every corner of Hong Kong, the club is also working with the Reporters Association, the Youth Reporters Association, the YMCA, the Women's Association, and other groups to jointly undertake the task of promoting it. The club's views on this matter will be published in a statement during the day. This is naturally something that everyone is happy to raise their hands in support of and cheer for without reservations.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also enthusiastically told reporters that during the Lunar New Year, everyone is on vacation and there is no proper recreation. Therefore, they are either bored or distressed, or they are tempted by improper entertainment. Therefore, the club plans to hold group travel during the Lunar New Year. On the one hand, they can enjoy the pleasure of sightseeing in the beautiful nature, and they can also take this rare opportunity to connect with the members of the society. There is also a more important task, which is to launch a discussion on how to save money for donations. ——Lively and serious, it is naturally the group life that is needed today.</p>
<p>The association is a healthy group organized by professionals from all walks of life in Hong Kong, and its sister organization of the same nature, the Hong Kong Bankers' Amateur Social Club, also has similar actions. The future impact is expected to have good effects.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Reporters Association also plans to hold group travel on the Lunar New Year's Day to live a meaningful and collective life that needs to be promoted.</p>
<p>It is further reported that timber, cloth, foreign goods, and other business houses are also responding to the suggestions of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and have decided to first forgo the Spring Festival banquet. Mrs. Liang Pei, director of general affairs of the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association, recently saved the expenses for her husband Liang Pei's birthday and donated CN$1,000, which was remitted to the War Relief Association for distribution. The association also received CN$100 from the workers of the Taikoo Western Warehouse, surplus profits from Chen Xin's charity sale of HK$30, and 19 bags of flour from the Huaan Guesthouse. The movement to save money to save the country is gaining momentum.</p>

<h3>Governor of Hong Kong to Build a Beautiful Yacht; Allocation of $400,000 Proposed; To be Discussed at the Next Legislative Council Meeting</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the authorities will submit a request to the Legislative Council to approve an appropriation of $400,000 to build a small 120-foot-long launch, the uses of which will be (1) the Governor's yacht, (2) a training ship for the Naval Volunteer Force (which will be renamed the British Naval Reserve), and (3) a supply ship for lighthouses. Since the sinking of the rescue launch Jiuxing in the typhoon disaster of last year, Hong Kong has lacked the equipment for a rescue launch. Therefore, it is the opinion of the general public that the launch should be equipped with rescue equipment to replace Jiuxing. However, the design of the launch has already been drafted, and although its equipment can withstand hurricanes, rescue equipment such as towing boats is still lacking. The launch is very luxuriously decorated, in preparation for the Governor to sail out to sea for leisure during his spare time, so the equipment is very complete. When the plan is submitted to the Legislative Council for a vote in the future, if it is considered necessary to add rescue equipment, it will be necessary to make major changes. The old Jiuxing launch is no longer suitable for rescue work, and it is extremely difficult to fire up the launch. During the typhoon season, it is necessary to keep the fire burning all day in preparation for departure, so the annual cost of maintaining the launch is very high, and its use is limited and cannot be used to supply lighthouses, so it is equivalent to being abandoned. Now, if the new launch plan is approved by the Legislative Council, a tender will be invited immediately. In addition, the authorities may build two more launches for general purposes.</p>
<h3>One Page of Brilliant Broadcasts in Hong Kong: Broadcasting Station Received Western War News Yesterday; Sound of Military Footsteps and Vehicles Faintly Audible</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's ZBW broadcasting station yesterday (10th) received news from London regarding the Spanish Civil War. The news was relayed by a BBC war correspondent, who connected from Li Bao-de, on the Spanish border, via telephone to England, and then rebroadcast it globally. Wireless radio users in Hong Kong all received the news, which was very clear. When it was announced that Franco's troops were only three miles from the border, the sound of advancing military footsteps was faintly audible. At that time, the government troops had already entered French territory, and the rumbling of military vehicles vibrated in the ears. According to the correspondent, these were Russian troops, heavily laden with military equipment, and the Spanish government's prime minister and foreign minister were holding an emergency meeting a few yards from the correspondent. Hong Kong residents who listened to this news on the radio all agreed that it was the most brilliant program since the establishment of radio stations in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Overseas Filipino-Cantonese Chinese Donate Two Thousand Dollars to Relief Efforts for Distressed Fishermen in Hong Kong; Fishermen's Association Sends Letter of Thanks Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Philippine Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association, recognizing that our country's fishing boats have been repeatedly robbed and killed by × ships, leaving tens of thousands of fishermen displaced and destitute, and that assisting those in distress is a shared responsibility, raised one thousand dollars and remitted it to the Hong Kong Relief Federation, requesting it to be transferred to the Fishermen's Association for use in relieving distressed fishermen. The Fishermen's Association deeply appreciates the Philippine Association's assistance and yesterday entrusted the Relief Federation to send a letter of thanks. The letter is recorded below: "To the esteemed members of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association, We, the Fishermen's Association, received a letter from Mr. Cai Chusheng on the 4th of this month, along with an official letter from the Hong Kong Joint Relief Committee for South China, stating that the Philippine Cantonese Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association has donated two thousand national currency dollars to the Fishermen's Advancement Association for the relief of fishermen, and entrusting Mr. Cai with the responsibility, and requesting a detailed plan for distributing the relief funds. We immediately drafted a plan for industrial relief cooperation and construction, emphasizing collective economics to promote both charity and production, and replied to Mr. Cai, who agreed. Yesterday (7th), our association issued a receipt and received the two thousand national currency dollars. Now, we can only ask the Hong Kong Relief Federation to convey our sincere gratitude to the Philippine Cantonese Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association, and express our association's willingness to do its utmost to serve the fishermen. If our strength is insufficient, we will rely on the assistance and encouragement of enthusiastic members of society. If you do not forsake us, we implore you to provide guidance. We thank you in advance and will report further on our progress. Sincerely, we extend our best wishes to the esteemed members of the Philippine Cantonese Overseas Chinese Joint Relief Association."</p>

<h3>Ample Supply of Firewood Arrives From Various Ports; Firewood Shortage Crisis Over; Firewood Prices Will Gradually Decline; No Possibility of Skyrocketing; Over 100,000 Piculs of Singapore Firewood to Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>The supply of firewood to Hong Kong has been cut off for many days, and firewood prices have soared. As of last month, the supply was still scarce, and the situation of expensive firewood had not improved. During this difficult time, with the Lunar New Year drawing to a close, firewood consumption is expected to increase by 500,000 to 600,000 piculs compared to usual. Housewives generally worried that firewood prices would continue to rise. The reporter specially visited Mr. Fang Meiquan, chairman of the Firewood Industry and Commerce Association, to inquire about the source of firewood from various rivers and whether the firewood shortage issue had been resolved. He said that with the shipping routes from various rivers now somewhat open, Hong Kong merchants are competing to purchase from other ports, and the difficult situation has been overcome. The supply of firewood from various places is continuous, and firewood prices will only gradually decline, with no possibility of rising. Judging from the current situation, the amount of firewood stockpiled in Hong Kong is even greater than in the same period last year. Since last week, firewood prices have decreased by about ten catties per dollar compared to before. Singapore, Sandakan, Shantou, and Guangzhou Bay firewood is priced at 80 catties per dollar, Haikou firewood at 90 catties per dollar, and Annam Haiphong firewood averages 150 catties per dollar (all wholesale prices), but there are few buyers, because the goods are not dry and difficult to burn. The American West America is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow, carrying about 100,000 piculs of Kuala Lumpur firewood, with a wholesale price of about 115 catties per dollar, so it is expected that firewood prices will fall even further.</p>
<h3>Governor to Hold a Festive Banquet for Hong Kong Justices of the Peace and Members of the Legislative and Executive Councils</h3>

<h3>Anti-Japanese War University Resumes Publication; Re-launch Issue Arrives in Hong Kong Via Guilin</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese War University bi-monthly, formerly published in Guangzhou, had correct views and progressive content, and was an authority in South China's public opinion, and was much loved by a wide readership. After the abandonment of Guangzhou, the publication moved to Guilin to prepare for resumption of publication. The current re-launch issue has arrived in Hong Kong, with an article by Liao Bingzhi refuting Wang Jingwei and his followers' traitorous theories after Wang's departure, which is worth discussing. Other articles include Pu Te's "Current Issues in Defending Dongjiang" and Pan Lang's "Calling on Overseas Chinese to Develop Western Economic Construction," all of which are quite excellent.</p>

<h3>A Meeting with Ms. Huang Xiuji, Executive of the National YMCA, Regarding Relief for Refugee Students</h3>
<p>— Qiao Ren</p>
<p>The flames of invasion have reached every corner of the land, and the people have tasted the bitterness of displacement and hardship. They have nothing to eat, nowhere to live, and even everyone's career has been ruined, starting their lives of wandering and fleeing. But the motherland is fighting to resist unreasonable aggression, and is firmly prepared to endure any difficulties and hardships to support the long-term war of resistance, as long as the goal of freedom and liberation is achieved. When will the refugees stop wandering, and where will they flee to? We really cannot continue to wander, and we really cannot continue to flee. Each of us is needed by the motherland! Especially the countless students who have fled from the war zones to various places, abandoning their studies, is simply a great loss to the foundation of the country!</p>
<p>The Student Department of the National YMCA, in order to provide relief to these out-of-school youths, has specially organized the National Student Relief Association. It has received enthusiastic sympathy from the Student Mutual Aid Association and the Far Eastern Student Relief Association, and has promoted these relief affairs to various places. With the financial support from enthusiastic people at home and abroad, the work has been carried out smoothly, and local committees have been established in various places. In Hong Kong, Ms. Huang Xiuji, an executive of the Student Department specially dispatched by the National YMCA, is in charge. Ms. Huang has been in Hong Kong for a long time and has achieved considerable success in her work of providing relief to refugee students. The reporter heard that Ms. Huang was about to leave Hong Kong, so yesterday I specially visited her to inquire about the recent progress of the relief effort for refugee students.</p>
<p>The reporter met Ms. Huang in the reception room of the YWCA. Her simple and unadorned clothes and kind attitude gave me the impression of a typical woman of the era. After explaining my purpose, Ms. Huang gave me a detailed account of the progress of the relief effort for refugee students.</p>
<p>"Since the war in South China broke out and Guangzhou unfortunately fell, many students from the mainland have fled to Hong Kong. Therefore, providing relief to refugee students in Hong Kong is an urgent task. The headquarters has extended this work to Shanghai, Beiping, Wuhan, Xi'an, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places, where local committees have been established. I was commissioned by the headquarters to come to Hong Kong and, together with the YMCA and YWCA, and leaders enthusiastic about student affairs, to organize the Hong Kong Student Relief Committee, which specializes in handling this work. I am very grateful for the help of the gentlemen of the press, who have worked hard to publicize this matter, making the promotion of the work very smooth. At present, the relief work for refugee students in Hong Kong can be said to have achieved unexpected success. There are already more than 200 students registered, and the first batch of applications for subsidies for travel expenses to go to school in the mainland, more than 120 have been approved, and many more are being registered.</p>
<p>"The relief measures for these refugee students generally include six items: (1) loans, (2) tuition subsidies, (3) student dormitories, (4) travel expense subsidies, (5) special training classes, and (6) job placement. The method of relief will be decided based on their individual circumstances. Most of the students registered in Hong Kong are willing to return to the mainland to study, so requests for the fourth type of relief measure are the most numerous. As Mr. Xu Shiying said well: History tells us that there are often great thinkers or writers in times of turmoil. As long as we can work harder to seek knowledge in the midst of difficulties and hardships, the future will be bright. Therefore, we must bring many refugee students back to the motherland, so that they will feel closer to the motherland and have easier access to opportunities to serve the country."</p>
<p>Finally, Ms. Huang told the reporter that she had decided to leave Hong Kong for the mainland this afternoon (i.e., yesterday) to continue the relief work. Her itinerary is to take the Guangdong steamer to Haiphong first, and then transfer to Guilin, Kunming, and Guiyang, and at the same time, she will discuss the resettlement of refugee students returning to the mainland from Hong Kong in detail with the local education authorities. Because Ms. Huang was busy preparing for her trip, the reporter bid her farewell.</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>From Shantou to Saigon (1)</h3>
<p>— Hua You</p>
<p>The Dark Side of the Passenger Trade</p>
<p>If you have ever paid attention to the Shantou newspapers, then you will understand how the Shantou passenger agencies have manipulated Singapore ship tickets in the past year. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, a ticket to Annam (first-class cabin) could be bought for just over ten yuan in Shantou currency. After the war broke out, many wealthy families and ignorant young men from all over the Chaozhou region avoided conscription, so there was a particularly large increase in the number of people going to Southeast Asia to be exploited by foreigners. Tickets to Singapore, Siam, and other places cost no less than three or four hundred yuan. How could ordinary families raise so much money for travel? They had no choice but to go to Annam. Although Annam has import taxes and head taxes, they total only thirty or forty yuan in Vietnamese currency, and even with travel expenses, it should not exceed eighty yuan (in national currency). Of course, it is much cheaper than going to Singapore, Siam, and other places! Therefore, the three steamers going to Vietnam—the Pacific, the Li Men, and the Great China—were always packed like pig transporters (according to a purser on the Li Men, whenever the steamer approached the Saigon River, the ×××× Bureau's ×××× could not help but ask the ship owner, "How many pigs have you brought this time?"). The Shantou inns (except for Wu Shunxing Inn) usually wanted to extract a large profit from passengers going to Singapore, and at this point had to shift their focus, extorting from those going to Annam. Now I will write about my personal experience of being exploited at the time, so that those from the Chaozhou region going there will know what to avoid.</p>
<p>Because I had not been to Annam for six years, everything felt unfamiliar to me. In particular, I found it very strange how the price of ship tickets to Annam had risen after the war of resistance. This time, I bought tickets to Annam at a certain address in Chaoan City (I will conceal the name for now). When I first asked them, they said it was 27 yuan in national currency per ticket, but the next day, I saw them holding a telegram from a certain passenger agency on Ronglong Street in Shantou (their affiliated company), saying that there were many passengers and the ticket price had risen to 30 yuan! Although I am not a cunning merchant, I also understand that there is such a thing as "prices fluctuating from morning to night" in the business world, so I mistakenly assumed that they had so-called morning and evening prices, and without thinking, I booked two tickets.</p>
<p>Since Chaozhou and Shantou were bombed by × planes at the same time on July 2, the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway also changed its train timetable to twice a day, morning and evening. We took the night train to Shantou on July 17. Because an air raid alert was issued in Shantou that evening, we waited at the Caitang station for a full hour before we could rush south. When we arrived at the Shantou station, illuminated by several large floodlights, we could not help but sigh at the ruins left behind by the × aircraft at the beginning of the month! When we took a rickshaw into the city, we saw the entire Shantou city buried in the black dawn of the night god, which could not help but remind us of Shantou before being destroyed by × aircraft, when the myriad electric lights illuminated the entire Shantou city, making it so beautiful and lovely! And thinking that tonight, my wife and I were embarking on a journey to a dark land, preparing to flee overseas, made us hate the inhumanity of the × people even more!</p>
<p>After entering the inn, everything was unpleasant—their rooms and their bedding were as dirty as their personalities, making me want to vomit for three days! We had no choice but to temporarily leave our luggage there and take a car to the Overseas Chinese Hotel to open a room.</p>
<p>The inn's business was terribly bleak! This made us feel very lucky to have such a quiet place, because there were no electric lights. The room had only a bean-sized kerosene lamp and a three-inch-long, pen-like hole of white light. Fortunately, the place was quiet and the bedding was clean, which gave us, a couple about to flee overseas, a lot of comfort. Speaking of the price, the rent, including tips, was only a little more than one dollar, which was exceptionally cheap!</p>
<p>Early in the morning, two rickshaws were waiting for us at the door of the hotel—we had told them in advance last night. Everywhere the rickshaw passed, the shops were tightly closed. When you looked closely, you could see that many shops were guarded by iron generals. The police patrolling along the way constantly questioned the rickshaw drivers, "Why haven't you gone to Zhongshan Park for training?" The rickshaw drivers replied, "We'll go after we finish this business." According to the rickshaw drivers, today was the first day of training for rickshaw drivers in Shantou. After hearing their words, I was glad that I had called them to wait at the door of the hotel last night, otherwise, I don't know how I would have reached the Dehexing Inn this morning, as I am so unfamiliar with the streets of Shantou.</p>
<p>After arriving at the inn, we began to go through the formalities for leaving the country. The so-called formalities involved filling out an emigration application. I dare not say that this procedure is wrong, but when it is not handled properly, it becomes a nuisance to overseas Chinese. For example, the four-inch headshot photo affixed to the application form could have been taken freely at any photography studio, as long as the face matched. However, the Shantou inns stipulated that the photography fee was collected by them, and they casually took us to a quick-shot studio on the street to take a photo, charging six dimes in national currency. In addition, the vaccination fee at the Shantou Customs Epidemic Prevention Center was two yuan in Shantou currency, equivalent to more than eight dimes in national currency (it used to be free), but the inn charged an additional two dimes for some kind of handling fee. After the emigration application was filled out, the inn's clerk would usually advise you not to go to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau for questioning, saying that it would save you the trouble of this procedure for just two dollars. Unfortunately, I am not a trafficker of people and do not need to pay the two dollars. Writing this makes me very sad! The establishment of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau was originally intended to prevent criminals from trafficking in people or abducting women, and its intention was very good! Unexpectedly, it has also become a way for people to make money. With two dollars, you can take a woman out of the country, which is not even the price of a pig!</p>
<p>We insisted on going to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau for questioning, and the people in the inn always tried to deceive you with all kinds of words, saying that the seaplane of the × warship parked outside the island had already taken off, or that an air raid alert had been issued in Chenghai, and they would definitely deceive you into paying them two dollars. Helpless, we were determined to be bombed to death by × planes rather than spend the two dollars unjustly, and went to the city government. In this way, the inn sent a clerk to follow us. The reason why they sent this clerk was not to help you, but to instruct you, "When the interrogating officer asks you how much you bought your ticket for, please tell him twenty-four yuan." After hearing this rare instruction, I was extremely angry! Because the inn acted as an agent for the ticket, charging 30 yuan in national currency per ticket (some even extorted nearly 40 yuan). It has already been taken by them, and to report it would naturally delay the trip. On the one hand, the questioner only asks you how old you are and then tells you to leave, which gives the inn an advantage. After getting off the boat that day, I inquired of the purser of the Pacific, and learned that their company stipulated that each ticket should be sold for 20 yuan, and the city government explicitly ordered that the ticket price sold by each inn should not exceed 24 yuan. They are actually extorting at will, which is inexcusable—After the boat had set off, I inquired around and learned that the passengers staying at the Wu Shunxing Inn in Shantou were all sold tickets for 24 yuan, which really made me feel that the person in charge of that inn was commendable! While other inns are "taking advantage of the fire to rob," they are able to show conscience. Is it any wonder that their business accounts for 60% of all Shantou inns!</p>
<p>Although I have never stayed at the Wu Shunxing Inn, I have done a lot of voluntary publicity for them. Whenever there are travelers coming to the West to buy tickets to Vietnam, I always introduce them to Wu Shunxing to buy tickets! This means "those who have the Tao are helped by many"! You innkeepers who "take advantage of the fire to rob," do you also know the principle that "those who have lost the Tao are helped by few"?</p>
<p>From Shantou to Saigon, the journey takes 96 hours. At 5 p.m. on the 22nd, the boat docked at Pier No. 8 in the drizzling rain (there were a total of 12 piers). But we could not go ashore, because the customs officers had already stopped working, so everyone had to sleep on the boat for another night. In the evening, people on the shore were constantly swarming, looking to see if their relatives and friends had come from the south. Some bought bread and sausages and threw them into the boat (because people coming to inquire about their relatives and friends could not stand close to the edge of the boat under the strict surveillance of the police). Seeing others eating bread, I really felt a bit envious. Unfortunately, I had not informed my family in advance, otherwise, my younger siblings would have been among the people swarming on the shore!</p>

<h3>A Journey in Northern Fujian (3)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Wang Qixi</p>
<p>Yanping was formerly the name of a prefecture. It was established as a military post in the Tang Dynasty, changed to Nan Jian Prefecture, Nanpu County in the Song Dynasty, Yanping Circuit in the Yuan Dynasty, and a prefecture in the Ming Dynasty, belonging to Fujian. The Qing Dynasty followed this system. It was abolished in the Republic of China. Today, Nanping is its former seat. The area is extremely rugged and adjoins Shaowu Prefecture. It is said that "One Copper Yanping, Iron Shaowu County" means that it can be defended. Nanping is located by mountains and streams, and has natural defenses. Currently, many of the residents have built air-raid shelters on the mountain walls, which is similar to the ancient cave-dwelling people. A famous scenic spot here is Cuige, which houses a very exquisite Buddhist temple. There is a stone stream that is several hundred steps long. From a high vantage point, you can see the Jianxi River, and the scenery is very beautiful.</p>
<p>Day Nine: Nanping to Fuzhou</p>
<p>At 7:00 a.m., we boarded a small boat along the Jianxi River. Nanping is about 420 li from Fuzhou. It takes 10 hours to reach Fuzhou downstream, and more than 20 hours upstream. There are many hidden reefs in the stream, so it is not possible to travel at night. Therefore, it takes two days upstream.</p>
<p>It rained heavily that day, and the stream flowed like a torrent. There were many mountains on both sides, and many beaches in the stream. Looking back, we saw the folk boats sailing upstream. In deep water, they sailed slowly with their sails up. In rapids, they pulled the cables to climb. It was said that they could only travel fifty or sixty li a day. The boatmen wore straw raincoats and bamboo hats and waded through the water to row the boat. Occasionally, reefs protruded from the stream like mushrooms. They braved the rain to look for fish. The scenery was natural and picturesque.</p>
<p>Along the way, we passed Xiadao, Jixi, Xiexie, Hulushan, Yuexi, Taiping, Youxikou, Zhanghuban, and arrived at Sandukou. This is a small village with more than 100 households. A water police team is stationed in the village, so upstream ships all spend the night here, while downstream ships stop and then leave immediately.</p>
<p>We then passed Huangtian and arrived at Gukou, which is under the jurisdiction of Gutian County. Small steamers from Fuzhou go directly here. Further down is Wankou. Another 20 li is Shuikou, which reaches the town of Erzhong, with hundreds of households and shops. Most of the timber transported downstream is first parked here and then transferred to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Below Shuikou are Daren, Hongzhenxi, Daruo, and Xiaoruo, and the road to Minqing from Minqingkou diverges here. From here, the beaches and currents gradually become gentler. After passing Shangxikou, Guanyinqi, Xiaqi, Yuankou, Jinzhongge, Baisha, and Zhuqi, we arrived at Houguan City. There are many olive, longan, and lychee trees on both sides. The greenness in the rain made it even more beautiful. As dusk approached, we looked at the houses on both sides and saw wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys.</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m., we arrived at Hongshan Bridge, which was already lit up with thousands of lights. We had personally experienced the so-called "Night Mooring at Hong Bridge." There is a customs and water police checkpoint here. After inspection, tourists from the city all go ashore from here. The small steamer continued to sail forward, passing through Sanxian and stopping at Longtan Jiao, opposite Nantai Island. Zhao and I then hired a car back to Cangshan, south of the bridge, and our ten-day journey came to an end.</p>

<h3>Answering Chen Tianru in Singapore</h3>
<p>Question: I, your humble brother, am going to Singapore to do business, but have some questions about the procedures for obtaining a permit and travel expenses, which I list below:</p>
<p>(1) Does the Singaporean authorities' restriction on the entry of Chinese laborers refer to un-passported steerage passengers?</p>
<p>(2) Ship tickets have risen to almost three hundred dollars. Does this refer to the price of a steerage ticket without a passport? If so, how much would the fare be for someone who has already obtained a passport? (Calculate the cheapest possible.)</p>
<p>(3) I have heard that traveling by postal ship does not cost much. Is this true?</p>
<p>(4) If a passport has already been obtained, which company's ship is the cheapest to travel on, approximately how much would it cost, and what class of accommodation?</p>
<p>(5) What are the entry procedures for passport holders when they arrive in Singapore, and what are the procedures for those without?</p>
<p>(6) What are the procedures for obtaining a passport, and how much does it cost?</p>
<p>Answer: To go to Singapore, you must obtain an exit passport in advance and have it endorsed at the Hong Kong government passport office. Each ship is limited to only twenty-five new passengers. Steerage tickets without a passport are sold by hotels, and the selling price is doubled. If, upon arrival in Singapore, one is unable to disembark, the return fare to Hong Kong has already been collected. Please follow the procedures for going to Singapore, and do not attempt it rashly.</p>
<p>(2, 3, 4) If you have already obtained a passport, take a second-class seat on a Great Britain Company or Duck House Company ship, which costs seven pounds. However, it is quite difficult for new passengers to book a seat because old passengers' seats must be reserved first.</p>
<p>(5) Passport holders have no other procedures to follow when arriving in Singapore.</p>
<p>(6) The cost of an exit passport is a total of twenty-one Hong Kong dollars.</p>

<h3>Important Information on the Interport Game: The Chinese Select Team Was Selected Yesterday. There Are Many Famous Players in the Philippine Team, and Their Strength Is Quite Strong. The Hong Kong Select Team Will Have Another Practice Match with the Army League Next Wednesday.</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Recently, Hong Kong's football fans have been paying close attention to the Hong Kong-Philippines interport game. The scene of scrambling to watch the practice match between the select team and the league team on Thursday, and the congestion of Chinese and Western people rushing to Qianghua Sporting Goods Company and Moutrie Piano Company yesterday to pre-purchase tickets, all prove how deeply football has penetrated people's hearts. The writer spent a day yesterday running around to various parties to investigate, and learned that the preparations for this important match by both Hong Kong and the Philippines, as of yesterday, can be considered a complete success. Various pieces of information are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese Team Was Selected Yesterday</p>
<p>According to our Chinese mentality, the selection of the Chinese team is as important as whether the players are satisfactory. Everyone is eager to know its lineup as soon as possible. It is now known that representatives from various associations held a meeting in the office of lawyer Luo Wenjin yesterday to discuss the matter. The result of the selection was satisfactory and can be called the standard Chinese team lineup in Hong Kong today. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian (South China Chinese)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South China South) Mai Shaohan (South China South)</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Liang Rongzhao (South China South) Song Lingsheng (Oriental Club)</p>
<p>Hou Chengtuo (Oriental Club) Li Zhaorong (South China Chinese) Li Huitang (South China Club) Feng Jingxiang (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)</p>
<p>(Reserves) Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua) Liu Qingcai (South China South) Chen Dehui (South China Chinese) Yang Shuiyi (South China Chinese)</p>
<p>Many Capable Players in the Philippine Team</p>
<p>According to a telegram sent by the Philippines to the Hong Kong Football Association yesterday, many wealthy businessmen in the Philippines, upon hearing that Hong Kong's famous player Li Huitang had been invited out of retirement, were preparing to jointly charter a ship specifically to come to Hong Kong to watch the excitement, and requested that the Football Association reserve 150 first-class seats for them. At the same time, it was also stated that 15 players have been selected, led by volunteer coach Jia Erwo, to come to Hong Kong, and will arrive early on the 14th on the Russian Empress. The list of players is as follows:</p>
<p>Yao E (La Salle College) Wei Lannuohua (Lie Dilun Team)</p>
<p>M. Molanda (La Salle College) Xiang Nanatas (Thomas University) Ba Weigao (Lie Dilun Team)</p>
<p>Hua Lisi (La Salle College) Yao Jidi (La Salle College) Jia Balas (YCO Team) Nie Du (YCO Team)</p>
<p>Bi Zhi (YCL Team) Bao Seli (YCL Team) Ding Molan (All-Philippines Representative) Wang Xias (Lie Dilun Team) Xia Lidia (La Salle College) Li Yesi (La Salle College)</p>
<p>It is found that these fifteen strong men are all famous players in the Philippines. Goalkeeper Yao E is five feet ten and a half inches tall and has been selected as an All-Philippines representative for four years, with the nickname "Iron Gate." Left inside E. Molanda is a handsome young man with agile movements, and is said to be the best inside forward in the history of Philippine football. Defensive midfielder Yao Jidi is good at the third inside forward tactic. Left forward Hua Lisi is known as the "airbag." Left inside forward Bao Seli is a Frenchman, a former star player of the Shanghai French Concession team, who has been selected as an interport representative many times, is good at passing, and is very skilled. Many others are famous players who have attended the Far Eastern Games. It is said that the Philippines considers today's team to be the best representative team in recent years.</p>
<p>Select Team's Second Practice</p>
<p>Since the first trial match on Thursday, the first team failed to defeat the Hong Kong League team, which was hastily assembled due to a lack of coordination, public opinion has expressed dissatisfaction. People in the Football Association are also deeply worried that if the team does not focus on coordination, it will be difficult to win. Therefore, it was decided yesterday that the first team will have another practice match next Wednesday, and it was agreed that the army and navy would send a strong league team to compete in order to review their strength. It is said that the army and navy have agreed to send a team to the match at that time. The competition venue is still the Navy Stadium in Liuluowan, and it is scheduled to start at 5:00 pm. The entrance tickets are still only 2 hao each. The directors, in view of the congestion of the audience the day before, have decided to start opening the four gates at 4:00 pm to sell tickets.

<h3>Special Silver Plate Muddled Account: South China South vs. Kowloon. There Are Also Important Battles in the Second and Third Divisions.</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] During the great Spring Festival, there are many football events. The general public living in this "Shangri-La" would rather ignore the chaos and not hear about promotions and demotions, but they are particularly concerned about football.</p>
<p>Today's football is another good program. Special Silver Plate and League matches will be held, and the most upsetting scene for the football kingdom is the third match between South China South and Kowloon. This is the Silver Plate quarter-final. The two teams have gone through two bitter battles without determining the winner. Therefore, today is the third time to settle the score to determine the winner.</p>
<p>The Kowloon Association is full of ambition and really wants to defeat South China. In the previous big interport practice match, the team's players (Lie Zhi, Zuo Zhi, and Yachen) were originally Hong Kong League representatives, but they selfishly refused to play for the Hong Kong League and only prepared to fight South China. It seems that this selfish behavior has stained sportsmanship, but their determination to win today's match is obvious.</p>
<p>The team also realized that Peel, who played as center forward in the second match, performed poorly and lacked leadership. Today, Shen Dushi has been specially transferred to replace him. In addition, all the players are fully prepared and determined not to stop until they win. It is hoped that the South China players will cheer up and not let the villains succeed.</p>
<p>It is heard that there have also been changes in the South China lineup. Zhang Rongcai will be used as the goalkeeper. Rongcai had a very good performance during the expedition. The South China people have great confidence in him, so it is absolutely no problem to use him today to replace Bao Jiaping. However, there is a very surprising news that Zhang Manrong, who has not participated in the Xing Xing due to a foot injury for a long time, will be used as the left wing instead of Luo Douwen. If this is true, it is really unpredictable.</p>
<p>The reporter learned from other sources that Nan Su's plan to abandon Luo and use Zhang was based on the opinion of a committee member of the Football Department. This official was dissatisfied with Douwen's recent deteriorating performance, and also thought he was too lazy to practice. He also had the same dissatisfaction with Guo Yingqi, and may use Li Enliang to replace the left inside forward.</p>
<p>Many changes internally before the war are definitely not a good sign. It is hoped that the officials of the Football Department will not overdo things in this important match of life and death.</p>
<p>Most people predict that South China has a higher chance of winning, and the reporter also thinks so. However, I am not worried about South China's defense, but only about their weak offense, because the front line only has the "single-taste" short pass technique. If it is played well, it can definitely win, otherwise it may be difficult to achieve results. Moreover, the Kowloon Association's defenders can effectively break South China's strategy. I think that while the short passes of the Chinese front line cannot be dispensed with, it is best to also make more use of the crosses from both wings. If so, then the semi-final right should be considered South China's.</p>
<p>The second division Silver Plate is the semi-final. The match between West Engineering and Midu West is also a stimulating scene. Let's see who wins and gets the final right.</p>
<p>In the third division final, Skat has already defeated the plane once last week. If Skat wins again today, they will win the championship.</p>
<p>In the first division league match between the Tukat Army League and the Hong Kong Club, the victory or defeat does not affect the overall situation. It is expected that Skat can win two points and return. The lineups of South China and Kowloon are recorded as follows. (Stadium Taizui)</p>

<h3>YMCA Fitness Group Performs Gymnastics</h3>
<p>Gymnastics is gradually attracting the attention of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong because its various movements are very suitable for military purposes. The YMCA Fitness Group has been established for more than ten years. Recently, the group believes that during this period of resistance against Japan, front-line soldiers often lack medicine. It is the duty of the people to hold a gymnastics performance in the group's gymnasium at 7:00 tonight to raise money to buy medicine. Tickets are 2 jiao each and have already started selling. Buyers are very enthusiastic. All the proceeds will be used to buy medicine and hand it over to the Guangdong-Hong Kong YMCA's Anti-Japanese Service Group to take to the front line for use.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Game: Date to be Held After the Lunar New Year; Men's Open Tournament Registration Starts Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 1938 Women's Basketball Tournament ended a long time ago. The champion was Mei Fang Team and the runner-up was Pui To Middle School. However, the date of the award ceremony has not been decided yet. After the re-election of the committee members of the Basketball League this year, the league has been selecting important items for various measures, so this event could not be realized in a short time. The association is now seeking to complete the procedures as soon as possible. The award ceremony can be held on a suitable date approximately after the Lunar New Year. As for the Shenbao Cup charity game, a meeting was held a few days ago to discuss its organization. However, since the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the league committee members have just been selected, there are still many association affairs to be handled. Therefore, the date of the Shenbao Cup will have to be decided at a meeting after the Lunar New Year. In the future, women's basketball teams participating in the competition will be selected by the league from the stronger teams as the main force. The competition will adopt an elimination system. In addition, registration for the men's open tournament started yesterday and will end on the 28th. As for the charity game to be held at the YMCA at 7 pm on the 13th of this month, the first game is scheduled to be between the women's team Zhi Xing and Pui To Middle School, and the second game is between the men's team Xing Huang and Oriental. All the ticket revenue will be allocated to the YMCA Agricultural College. The league has sent a letter to Zhi Xing, asking them to send a team to help with the charity event at that time. The team expressed great sympathy for this and agreed to send a team to compete at that time. However, the Pui To Middle School team is on winter vacation, and many players have gone elsewhere, making it difficult to gather them. Moreover, this matter is being carried out hastily, making it difficult to do. The league wanted to ask the Chinese Overseas team to participate, but they also declined for this reason. Therefore, the women's game at that time will be cancelled. The match between Xing Dao and Dongfang will be held as scheduled. Xing Dao does have many strong players, and their strength is exceptionally strong. The Oriental team also has many talents, such as Xu Xiang, Huang Dingfen, and Huang Jiliang, who are all basketball experts. The competition between the two teams will definitely be wonderful. The selected players from both teams are listed below:</p>
<p>(Oriental Association) Feng Nianhua, Xu Heng, Wu Huaxiong, Qiu Yongheng, Huang Dingfen, Lao Xiong, Luo Ji'an, Sun Zeqing, Zhong Guoneng, Chen Xianglin, Wu Guoxiang, Hu Bi, Wu Huaying, Huang Jiliang, Zheng Zaichun,</p>
<p>(Sing Tao Team) Li Peiyan, Li Pei Chi, Li Shijie, Dai Fucheng, Xin Yalang, Liang Guojing, Pan Yaojun, Lu Zhenxuan, Xiao Dianqing, Chen Shihong,</p>
<h3>Inter-School Table Tennis Tournament: Awards Ceremony Last Night</h3>
<p>The inter-school table tennis league organized by Huaxiong Association has been completed after a month of fierce battles. The champion was Kowloon College, the runner-up was Fanglin Middle School, and the third place was Guangda Association. The association held an awards ceremony at the Confucius Society yesterday afternoon at 7:00. At the same time, the Anti-Japanese Resistance to the End Cup donated by the reporter was also awarded. The attendance that evening was extremely enthusiastic, and the awards ceremony was extremely grand. After the awards were presented, the champion team played a demonstration match against the select team. Both sides had wonderful performances. As of press time, the winner had not yet been determined. Details will be reported later.</p>
<h3>Football Briefs</h3>
<p>In the Rongxing brand small football match, Huaxiong played against Datong at Shaudon Stadium yesterday afternoon at 4:00. Huaxiong won the game by a score of 1-0. There was also a final in Japan, but it was postponed due to stadium issues.</p>
<p>The Sing Tao basketball team held a friendly match with the South China team at the Youth Basketball Hall yesterday (10th) at 6 pm. After the start of the match, the two sides were evenly matched. Xu Heng, Luo Ji'an, Huang Dingfen, and Feng Nianhua of the Sing Tao team all made contributions, while Chen Xinqiu, Shi Zhen, Shi Zhenda, Qian Jinghui, and Xiao Jiemin of South China were not to be outdone, and made progress in separate attacks, also with repeated gains. However, the three armies of the Sing Tao team were brave and fierce, and South China finally lost due to its slightly weaker defense, giving Sing Tao an opportunity to take advantage. At the end of the game, the South China team lost to Sing Tao by a score of 48 to 49.</p>
<p>All matches of the Dasheng Cup volleyball tournament today and tomorrow have been postponed.</p>

<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment...Triangle Love</p>
<p>Three Loves Has Nancy</p>
<p>This is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. The film features witty and lively dialogue, plenty of laughs, vivid and lively performances by the actors, plus a very interesting love quadrangle, making this film a perfect and extremely entertaining comedy.</p>
<p>The story tells of a country girl who goes to the big city in search of her fiancé, causing a series of farcical events. Later, under special circumstances, she becomes involved in a crazy and hilarious love affair with a writer and the publisher of the writer's works.</p>
<p>The film captures and develops a fragment of modern urban life, presenting it in a very brisk manner. Director Richard Thorpe has a wealth of experience in handling comedies. He not only outlines a hilarious style for the entire film, but also fills every shot with a strong sense of humor. Every inch of film shown gives the audience no chance to stop laughing.  Janet Gaynor, playing the village girl in the film, displays a very lovely personality. She vividly portrays the pure and peaceful heart of a country girl and her distrust of urban friends, making her the most outstanding character in the film. Robert Montgomery and Franchot Tone, who play the writer and publisher respectively, also give wonderful and excellent performances. This film can be said to be their first collaboration and a successful work for the three stars.</p>
<p>Queen's Peace, shown with...Youth Takes a Fling</p>
<p>Youth Takes A Fling</p>
<p>The film depicts a lovelorn female clerk who pursues the man of her dreams. Unfortunately, the man is a bit dull-witted and is only interested in nautical pursuits, with nothing else worthy of his attention. Naturally, women are no exception. Even the tender affections offered by the female clerk fail to win his favor. In the end, he is determined to avoid her entanglement. However, the pain of seasickness shatters his nautical dreams and cures his heartlessness.</p>
<p>Although the film tries its best to enrich the content with various scenes, such as fashion shows and public swimming pools, it still fails to completely conceal the emptiness of the plot. As for the actors, Andrea Leeds gives a charming and touching performance. As for Joe McMichael, who plays the young man obsessed with sailing, although his portrayal of the character is a bit exaggerated, he is the central source of humor throughout the film.</p>
<p>Oriental...You're A Sweetheart</p>
<p>You're A Sweetheart</p>
<p>Produced by Universal Pictures, starring two singing stars, George Murphy and Alice Faye, and several comedy stars, the old rogue Charles Winninger and the silly Andy Devine. There are plenty of laughs and the songs are also very pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>Great China...Three Sisters</p>
<p>Sally, Irene, and Marg</p>
<p>Alice Faye, Joan Davis, and Marjorie Weaver, here are like three close sisters. Because of the economic depression, they have worked as manicurists and cigarette girls in dance halls. As a result, they meet the singing star Tommy – Tony Martin – and Sally – Alice Faye – falls in love with him at first sight. After several twists and turns, they acquire a dilapidated yacht. To renovate it into a floating nightclub, they need a large sum of money. Sally and Tony are both determined to sacrifice their happiness and are willing to marry two wealthy people who love them, as long as they can provide the money. The floating nightclub opens, and by a stroke of luck, the two male and female investors fall in love with each other. Everyone is happy, Sally and Tony get married immediately, and even the cleaner Jimmy Durante and Irene – Joan Davis! – are overjoyed.</p>
<p>The story is obviously a comedy. Jimmy Durante and Joan Davis are the central figures of the laughter. The former star Fred Allen is also coldly humorous and interesting.</p>

<p>The previous episode of "Seven Fresh Roses" ended with Ma Loufen marrying Lin Meimei. This episode begins with Lin giving birth to a child, and the relationship between Ma and Lin deteriorates. At the same time, it also recounts that Feng Feng and Xu Manli's marriage leads to conflicts due to their poor relationship, and they go to extremes. It further narrates that Ma Loufen accidentally encounters Xu Manli, and the two fall in love. The old couple discovers this, revealing that Ma and Xu were originally engaged. As a result, both sides realize their mistakes, and Ma flees far away. Eventually, he is moved by his son and returns home, where he and Lin are as loving as before.</p>
<p>To cater to a lowbrow audience, the plot is far-fetched and the acting is poor. The outdated approach makes the audience dislike it.</p>
<p>Central...Dreaming of Wonderland</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>"Alice in Wonderland"</p>
<p>Adapted from "Jing Yuan" (Tales from the Flowers in the Mirror), but it goes a step further. The entire play starts with New Ma Sze-tsang as the main character. He plays a waiter at a tea shop. One night, in a dream, he meets the God of Longevity, who takes him to various places, such as the South Heaven Gate, the North Heaven Gate, the Land of Giants, and the Land of Little People, where he sees all sorts of miracles he has never seen before. Watching this film is really like being in a dream.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the entire play is exceptionally scattered, and the plot has no central point. I believe that progressive audiences will not welcome such a film. The songs sung are still a few old tunes.</p>
<p>Lee Theatre and Ko Shing Theatre, showing with...Hua Mulan</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>The plot depicts a modern woman who, because she once performed in the stage play "Hua Mulan", always wants to be a modern "Hua Mulan". Sure enough, when the country is in serious trouble, she realizes her ambition. The reason is that she discovers a well-organized traitor organization, so she and her lover Kwong Shan-siu jointly try to crack this secret organization and steal documents. After countless difficulties, they finally achieve their goal. Even the clever and foolish traitors are moved by their great spirit and set off to the front lines together.</p>
<p>We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot utilize film techniques. The acting skills of Kwong Shan-siu and Chan Wan-sheung are mediocre.</p>
<p>Tai Ping...The Four Knights of the Wang Family</p>
<p>National film</p>
<p>Converted from a silent film to a sound film and colored from monochrome, the film has made a lot of progress in terms of material. The male lead is Wang Yin, but the female lead is a newcomer, Zhang Cuihong. The grandeur of the scenes is its improvement.</p>

<h3>Understanding Physical Training for Children</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>Parents should bear the greatest responsibility for the strict physical training of children. Parents must not only bear the responsibility of guidance, but also lead by example. They must have a deep understanding of health and exercise, and carefully observe the impact of exercise on children's bodies and their different reactions. In the family, the training of children should never be forced. The most effective methods are guidance and leading by example. If parents can lead by example, this idea will easily penetrate the minds of their children, thus stimulating their curiosity and interest.</p>
<p>It is always most difficult to start any undertaking. After stimulating interest, we must also pay attention to how to help them overcome difficulties and maintain their interest. Engaging in freehand gymnastics and apparatus exercises also has the same feeling at the beginning, but after practice, one does not feel bitter and instead feels comfortable.</p>
<p>Implementing this kind of exercise is even more effective in families with many children, because there are opportunities for comparison and competition.</p>
<p>The spirit during exercise is closely related to the results of the exercise. If "spiritual strength" is lacking during exercise, it is not only useless but often harmful. Therefore, when children feel tired of this kind of exercise or temporarily lose interest, do not force them to continue. In fact, this kind of exercise is no different from children's daily hygiene habits. If they have a sufficient understanding of exercise, they will not suddenly interrupt or engage in it perfunctorily. Therefore, the spirit of children's exercise often increases with age, so the older the age, the better the spirit. Although there are exceptions, they are very few.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the purpose of children's exercise is to make the body develop evenly and promote health. Developing muscles is secondary. Exercises that focus on developing muscles are very suitable for adults, but for children, their effectiveness is far below exercises that focus on making the body develop evenly.</p>
<p>If exercises that focus on developing muscles are applied to children, there may be no harm at present, and there may even be very good results. After a certain period of time, progress will suddenly slow down or stop completely, and various drawbacks will emerge in an endless stream. Various exercises that are most suitable for children may not have significant results at present, but amazing progress will be seen soon. The final results will definitely be far above any other exercise.</p>
<p>The scope of physical education is very broad. Exercise can only be said to be a small part of it. Nutrition, sleep, bathing, and body posture are all essential elements of physical education. If these elements are ignored, exercise will not only be useless but harmful. Habits become natural. During childhood, good habits should be developed for these elements. Otherwise, it will be difficult to correct them when they reach adulthood. Therefore, parents should not only guide children in exercise, but also pay close attention to these elements and common sense of hygiene.</p>
<p>The most suitable time for children's exercise is after getting up early in the morning and before bathing or washing up. Exercising early in the morning not only provides fresh air but also enables children to develop the habit of going to bed early and getting up early. You must bathe after exercise. Cold water baths are not suitable for children, but splashing the body with cold water after a warm water bath should not be regarded as a cold water bath. This method is not only harmless for children with sound bodies, but also very beneficial. There are countless methods of training children's physique, but not all of them are suitable for every child. They must also be implemented according to the individual.</p>
<p>Children are no different from adults. If they are not fully awake after getting up early in the morning, they should not exercise. The less clothing worn during exercise, the better, but be careful not to catch a cold because of this. If exercising indoors, the windows must be fully opened, after they are fully awake.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, you can do some more beneficial physical and mental games or ball games to increase interest, so that children do not feel bored or monotonous with exercise and become tired of it. But it should be noted that the exercises or games done in the afternoon should not be too strenuous. Ball games are often too strenuous for children, and it is difficult to adjust the degree of intensity. Especially for children who are not very healthy, they are even less able to cope with this kind of excessive exercise, which has already caused great damage to adults, and it is even more unthinkable for children.</p>
<p>Finally, there are different interpretations of the word "child" in general, but the children referred to in this article are those between the ages of seven and sixteen. (Central)</p>

<h3>Collective Creation and Reality</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>In the ever-changing reality of China's War of Resistance at this stage, what writers can grasp is often only a fragment, a side of the reality of the War of Resistance. Only when writers are organized in collective creation, jointly under a theme, each developing his grasp of a corner, a side, a fragment of the reality of the War of Resistance, and collectively incorporating each person's work, can they capture and reflect the entire rich content of the objective reality of the War of Resistance in a work. When a writer is creating alone, it is always difficult to absorb and express the essence of reality in its entirety. Usually, they can only absorb and express a small part of it, or one aspect of it. However, in collective creation, because each writer brings his cognitive and expressive abilities to bear on one side of reality, recognizing and expressing it together, it is often easier to absorb and express all the rich and multifaceted content of the essence of reality. Therefore, the literature of the War of Resistance needs to especially emphasize and focus on collective creation in order to obtain the most complete and precise creative method.</p>
<p>We know that the literature of the War of Resistance is the most familiar weapon for writers to participate in the national revolutionary War of Resistance, and the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance is the most scientific method for writers to use their weapons. A writer of the literature of the War of Resistance who participates in collective creation is like a person who, in addition to having a sharp blade, has also learned the purest swordsmanship. He can exert a greater effect on striking the enemy. Moreover, the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance can not only become a weapon for Chinese writers to participate in the collective struggle of the War of Resistance, but it can also become an opportunity to improve the writing skills and subjective consciousness of writers, because in the process of collective creation, it is necessary to go through many repeated collective discussions, research, criticism, and modification procedures. Writers inevitably have close corrections, criticisms, and influences on each other. Under the constant influence and training of this collective creation process, firstly, the writer's writing skills can be improved, guiding the writer to a higher level of writing skills that can correctly understand reality, skillfully handle the subject matter of reality, and maturely express reality. Secondly, the subjective understanding of the writer can be corrected, unifying many writers on a common understanding—a correct worldview, and improving his subjective consciousness. Therefore, the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance can also be regarded as an opportunity for writers to improve themselves.</p>
<p>The collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance is fundamentally a category of the creative method of moving realism. Its practical process is inseparably unified with the practice of concrete reality. From all the activities of collective creation, the writer must inevitably combine with the practice of reality, and cannot just shut himself up in a house and write blindly as in the traditional writing method. Therefore, the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance is not only to organize writers to engage in the practice of the War of Resistance (the practice of the War of Resistance is the most important form of practical practice at this stage). The collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance and the collectiveist national revolutionary War of Resistance have an inseparable and close relationship. Writers throwing themselves into the torrent of the collective struggle of the War of Resistance is caused by the technical organization of collective creation.</p>
<p>Although the collective creation method is a category of the creative method of a kind of moving realism, we certainly need to require all realistic literary workers to widely apply this practical way of creation, but the collective creation of the literature of the War of Resistance should not be limited to realistic literary workers. It can and should be widely developed in the practice of the War of Resistance literary creation of literary workers of various schools, so that it becomes one of the sharpest ways for them to use literary weapons, and more powerfully carry out their own combat tasks.</p>
<p>Collective creation is a tie that connects the literature of the War of Resistance with the War of Resistance, and a bridge that connects writers with the mass life of the War of Resistance. All literary writers standing in the torrent of the War of Resistance reality must reflect on this epoch-making historical change, express their own and their group's combat actions and real life in this War of Resistance reality, and promote the War of Resistance reality to a glorious and victorious future. They should immediately and universally practice this new type of collective creation to match their own War of Resistance practice and express the truth of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Unrequited Love</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>Love between two sexes must be based on mutual relationships.  Mutual love can only come from mutual attraction.  And only through mutual attraction can mutual love arise.  Otherwise, no matter how desperately you pursue, you cannot escape the tragic fate of failure, and you will end up with a "single-sided love" reputation.</p>
<p>The taste of longing is the bitterest, and the situation of unrequited love is even more awkward.  The death of Jia Rui in "Dream of the Red Chamber" at the hands of Wang Xifeng is the most tragic ending for a friend who is in unrequited love.  Some say: Wang Xifeng's teasing of Jia Rui was too vicious.  This statement seems right but is actually wrong.  They only see Wang Xifeng's poisonous trap of love, but they ignore the fact that Jia Rui's "toad wanting to eat swan meat" idea and behavior are the factors that led to his death.</p>
<p>A friend in unrequited love is blinded by lust, and his reason is also obliterated. He forgets objective facts and subjective conditions completely. Even if he doesn't get a response from the other party, he still "talks to himself" and is pleased with himself.</p>
<p>Stories of unrequited love are not only common between the sexes; even international conspiracies now feature unrequited love events. For example, our "friendly nation" to the east had the idea of turning to Wu Peifu a year ago. Recently, it has become even more lively and seems to be a serious matter. However, according to the Associated Press: The claim that Wu Peifu is actively participating in the so-called "peace" movement is actually a single-sided affair by one party.</p>
<p>In fact, Wu Peifu's participation or non-participation in the so-called "peace" movement has no major impact on China's future in the war of resistance. The reason is: Wu Peifu can still be worshiped as an idol by some Chinese compatriots today because he has an aura of integrity. If he were to brazenly serve the enemy, then he would lose the conditions for being worshiped, and he would not be able to produce the effect that the neighboring "friendly nation" wants to produce. But General Wu Peifu, who prides himself on being Yue Wumu, will not give in to power, wealth, or persuasion. How could he ruin his reputation in his later years and fall into the trap of the neighboring "friendly nation", making himself a puppet on the stage? The "friendly nation" to the east knows this, but because it cannot make military progress, is isolated in the international situation, and its people are full of complaints, and it has repeatedly failed in its political conspiracies, it comes up with this inferior strategy. To its dismay, it hits a blank again, and it is still a single-sided love.</p>
<p>The evolution of unrequited love can lead to "flower madness". Flower madness can be divided into literary and martial types: the literary type is foolish and ignorant of human affairs; the martial type is crazy and reckless. As a result, they either become useless or die. It is said that the neighboring "friendly nation" wants to change its methods and adopt tough measures because it failed to befriend Wu Peifu. Then the friend in unrequited love will succeed in becoming a martial flower madman. How sad.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Techniques</h3>
<p>— Latt</p>
<p>In the cause of resisting the enemy and saving the country, everyone has deeply understood the importance of propaganda work. Similarly, everyone today has felt that stepping up the disintegration of the enemy's propaganda is an extremely urgent task. However, how can propaganda work achieve positive results? Many patriotic people have already conducted rigorous explorations and correct displays of this. But sometimes we also see self-proclaimed enlightened people, when expressing their views on dismantling the enemy's propaganda, often cause regrettable phenomena of counter-effect because of their unclear understanding of the issue and their personal prejudices being too deep. This is something that should be alerted.</p>
<p>Now, in order to intensify the work of the party and government in the occupied areas and to carry out propaganda to the enemy soldiers to disintegrate their strength or reduce their fighting morale, this is naturally an important aspect. In fact, the purpose of our propaganda to the enemy is also this. To achieve this goal, we should use various methods, either with words or directly, to contact the enemy's front-line soldiers, inciting their determination to oppose the war, and inspiring them to understand China's position in the war of resistance, to understand the aggressive purpose of their country's government, and the future of China's victory and Japan's defeat. Because in recent times, anti-war thinking has become widespread among the enemy soldiers. If we do not grasp this point correctly, but still mark out our own kind of incorrect propaganda topics for the sake of factional prejudices), that will not only lose the task of disintegrating the enemy's propaganda, but will produce a joke that runs counter to the purpose of propaganda. This is something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The main propaganda used by the Japanese militarists for the soldiers coming to China is still to say that they are coming to conquer uncivilized, uncultured, anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese China, and that they are coming to develop the vast resources of East Asia and permanently lay the only foundation for Japan's strong country and rich people to dominate the world. If we do not understand from this aspect, but insist on factional prejudices and create propaganda materials that do not match the anti-war psychology of the enemy soldiers, this will only confuse the enemy's views and will not meet the psychological needs of the enemy soldiers. Such a propaganda method is the most undesirable thing and should not be insisted on.</p>
<h3>Ruins and Gunsmoke</h3>
<p>— Written by Shiro Ozaki, Translated by Huanping Lin</p>
<p>It is considered extremely difficult to complete reconnaissance missions in the guerrilla-infested riverbank areas. Although Corporal Hiwei eventually returned safely to headquarters, it seemed that quite a few brave men who went out as scouts never returned. Initially, the defense of Hukou was the responsibility of a certain unit, which had its headquarters there. To defend against guerrillas, they deployed one-third of their forces in the mountain shadows a few meters from the city. However, a crack guerrilla unit sensed that the Japanese army's headquarters was lightly defended. So, under cover of darkness, more than four hundred men waited in the mountain shadows. At dawn, they skillfully crossed the sentry lines and approached the headquarters. By the time they were discovered, it was too late. The headquarters, caught off guard by the × people, had fewer than a hundred men and had no choice but to immediately prepare weapons and prepare for battle. At this moment, the × people's footsteps, rushing down the slopes between the valleys like rapids, suddenly stopped. It was only four or five minutes, but these four minutes were of paramount importance to the Japanese army. In the dim darkness of the night, it was impossible to see the enemy's form, which was fortunate. The Japanese army, having established a favorable position, began a vigorous attack. The × people, caught off guard, were somewhat flustered when a large unit of the Japanese army rushed from the front-line mountainous area, threatening their rear. The × people, unknowingly caught in a pincer movement, ended the battle in less than an hour. But why did the enemy's advance, rushing in one breath, suddenly stop at the entrance to the narrow road leading to the headquarters? — This remained a major question. As time passed, a fact was later discovered. The first person to know of the × people's attack was a private first class who was walking the same road from the opposite direction to relieve the sentry. The man, the bald-headed man walking at the front of the enemy unit, approached stealthily and bumped into him. Needless to say, he didn't seem to imagine that such a large unit would launch a sneak attack. At the time, he thought it was a Chinese scout who had lost his way. Private First Class so-and-so immediately raised his gun and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Do you know Kanbei of Asakusa?"</p>
<p>Kanbei of Asakusa—such strange words, of course, could not be understood by the Chinese soldiers. If Private First Class so-and-so had fired a shot or stabbed the opponent with a bayonet, such a result would certainly not have occurred. By saying "Kanbei of Asakusa" and raising his gun, he psychologically believed that he had a magic spell to ward off the enemy. In the valley behind the city, I saw houses with red-tiled roofs.</p>
<p>"What are those?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's the problem." Colonel Inoue replied, "It seems that someone always lives there, but we're too busy and haven't been to that place yet. We say we'll go today, then we say we'll go tomorrow, but we've decided that there probably aren't any big shots there, so we've just left it at that, and haven't gone."</p>
<p>I imagined in various ways the figures of the people who were left behind to live in that valley. At that moment, suddenly, from the darkness of the inner hall of a civilian house where the pillars and walls were all destroyed, something that was peeling and shaking moved. Peering out timidly, a shadow gradually approached along the ancient wall. It was a woman in her sixties—probably the only old woman left in this city. She fixed her eyes on us, with a gaze that was half pleading and half contemptuous. Colonel Inoue spoke to her, and a self-deprecating and ingratiating smile appeared on her oily, glistening face.</p>
<p>"I heard that this is the old woman's home." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Encirclement</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Thousands of small boats were moored in the pond, densely packed, looking like fish scales from a distance. Hundreds of large fishing boats were also moored outside the harbor, their sails resembling a beautiful and lush bamboo forest.</p>
<p>The sun climbed out of the sea, stirring up surging waves that crashed into the pond, causing the thousands of fishing boats to sway non-stop, alarming the young, strong fishermen. They jumped up in one motion, rubbed their eyes, reeled in the anchor ropes, and sang cheerfully: "...The foundation left by our ancestors, we rely on it to survive the summer and the winter. Yellow croaker is better than gold; ribbonfish, like jade rings... We're not afraid of many bandits, we're not afraid of their fierceness if we're of one mind, we are brave fishermen!..." They hummed like that, and they began their work.</p>
<p>The large fishing boats that went ahead formed a long line, truly like a long string of ribbonfish. The majestic singing filled the entire sea. In the sea, it brought back empty echoes from afar.</p>
<p>After leaving the harbor, the boats dispersed in all directions, each going to net fish, casting their large fishing nets, quietly.</p>
<p>The harbor surface was very calm, as if it had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>In a corner of the sea, a small warship with a poultice flag suddenly appeared, heading straight for the large fishing boats.</p>
<p>"Ah; bandits are coming? Are we waiting to die?... No! No! Strike first, Little San, blow the horn, let them come to help: Hai Gen, you guys prepare the cannons, quick! Quick!" the boat boss called out excitedly. He himself also ran to the cannon side, helping to load gunpowder.</p>
<p>"Dada... dada..." the horn sounded.</p>
<p>"Boom!" The boss personally fired the first cannon, the shell flying over and hitting the stern of the Japanese devil's ship, the bow slightly shaking forward.</p>
<p>"Boom!" The bandit ship also returned fire, the shell flying over, not far from a fishing boat, stirring up waves several feet high.</p>
<p>"Rat-a-tat-tat..." The bandit ship fired a machine gun.</p>
<p>"Guys, fire the guns, quickly, quickly, what are you dawdling for, damn it, fire the guns, fire the guns, quick, quick," the boss stretched his throat and shouted loudly, snatching a clay cannon from the hands of a crew member, aiming and firing.</p>
<p>"Boom... boom..." The bandit's cannons and the clay cannons.</p>
<p>"Rat... rat-a-tat-tat..." Machine gun.</p>
<p>"Bang—crack-bang—... crack-bang...!" Clay guns.</p>
<p>Soon, many other large fishing boats sailed in following the sound of the horn. Discovering the danger here, they immediately surrounded the bandit ship from the east and the west, like many starving fish competing for a large piece of bread.</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom!..." Shells flew towards the bandit ship like raindrops, it was under fierce attack and began to tilt slightly.</p>
<p>"Ah!" A bullet. Hit the boss's raised arm, bright red blood oozing from his sleeve, he couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Boss? You? You?" the crew gathered around.</p>
<p>"Are you crazy? Never mind me? Fire the cannon? Fire the gun? Fire quickly? Quick? Quick..." the boss's eyes bulged, clenching his teeth.</p>
<p>"Boom—boom boom—... Bang—crack-bang—crack—..."</p>
<p>The bandit ship couldn't stand it anymore, the stern sank into the water first, then the middle..., and finally the bow, thick white smoke rising on the water surface, gradually dissipating, and finally, the poultice flag on the bandit ship's mast also disappeared into the water.</p>
<p>"Boom... boom boom boom—" The last few funeral salutes were fired at the water where the bandit ship sank.</p>
<p>The boss raised his blood-soaked arm, and everyone sang together excitedly... "...We're not afraid of many bandits, we're not afraid of their fierceness if we're of one mind—we are brave fishermen!..."</p>
<p>The faces of the wounded were reflected with the glory of honor, having long forgotten the pain. They finally annihilated the invading bandits and avenged the great hatred of the sea and sky!</p>
