<h3>英法如何答復日本</h3>
<p>日軍旣在我國海南島登陸，英法兩國駐東京大使，相繼向日本外務大臣有田；提出質問，要求說明。英法質問之内容，未經刊布，我人無自獲知其詳；但純就外交範圍內吉之，所可根據之條約協定與聲明以及日本迭次所作諾言，不但資料豐富，抑且論據充盈，有非對方遁辭所得委蛇者；顧證之以日本政府所發外相有田答復英法兩大使之公報，似兩大使固亦未嘗就外交範圍據理力爭。意者，洞鑒於外交無靈，未欲辭費；僅以國際常例，姑且質問，但就外交範圍内之晟低限度，聊盡人事而巳。雖然，揆之常情恒理，迫使對方以不得不欺罔周旋，夫豈不如其巳？然則何爲多此一舉？抑明知對方之必以欺罔周旋，旣不振折之以正義嚴辭，而惟鞠躬以進之，我國逢豪奪，英法逢巧取，所遭遇之方式不同：故我國迫而悲壯，××××××，顧皆當世最可同情之國家也。我國抗戰旣逾十八個月。安得英法朝野，××××××××××××，亟於外交範圍之外，奮發有爲耶？</p>
<p>英法繼質問之後者，將何所爲？謂外交無靈，安知不將謂外交之技未窮。是則不但此次有田答復之辭，爲稍歷世故所能逆覩，蓋虛僞欺妄至於斯極，初非意外；即使再行抗議，亦必不出意料中之無結果．彼有田非謂日本對海南島無領土野心乎？夫何謂領土，東北乃我國之領士，而日本在我國東北之壓迫與搾取以及種種專制與運用，恣所欲爲，遠過於彼軍閥所得施之於彼三島之内者；日本固猶口口聲聲曰彼滿洲國也，日本無領土野心也；以彼例此，日本固不必曰將攫海南島爲領士也。彼有田又非謂佔領海南島之時期與性質，不超越　事需要乎？夫日本對華作戰無關一島，顧猶藉口於軍事需要而圖佔領之；則以今日國際競擴軍備之無涯，豈有日曰無需此島；以他日國際關係之愈趨尖銳，豈不可謂爲所謂『帝國生命線』，所謂『東亞新秩序『，爲所謂『太平洋之太平』，故在軍事上更需此島。質問百次，抗議百次，將如此答復者二百次。推彼之意，將有一焉，無須若此答復，卽對華略成功矣，經營至於根深蒂固矣，四千萬方里之沃壤，四萬五千萬之人民，與我國之資力物力人力，盡爲彼擴軍爭霸之用，無所忌憚於當世，歐美各國忍氣吞聲，以極自由之精神，極和平之方法，而自甘退出東亞矣：英法自將不復質問海南矣！推彼之意，期不在遠；祇待全能國家羽毛稍豐之日，便是民治國家××××之時；安南，婆羅洲，緬甸，菲律賓，××××，海南島其始而巳。</p>
<p>抑有田答復之中，亦有値得注意之暗示焉。彼謂日軍在海南島登陸，將以『削弱蔣上將之抗戰力量而促之傾覆』，是又欺人之談，蓋削弱者，乃日本之分兵旁騭，而削弱其自身之侵略力量：顧可明白反證者，乃爲海南島之遭遇，非爾外交質問所可變更，而海南島之。命，實决於蔣委員長領導之抗戰。惟此暗示，英法而不安於日　之將佔領海南島者，其惟有以最大之决心，最強之毅力，最敏捷之方法，對我國抗戰，盡所可能之極度而援助之。法國嘗虞日本佔領海南　以威脅安南，於是不顧我國根據中法滇越鐵道條約所應享運輸之權利，不顧國際聯盟儘量援助中國，毋使削弱中國抗戰力量之决議，不顧安南經濟上因此繁榮之機會，不顧滇越鐵道渾輸所得之利潤，不顧中法最友善之睦誼，而接受日本所提不運我國軍火之要挾，曾幾何時，日本以事實答復法國曰，日軍在海南島豋陸矣。英國嘗以目前微利而阻止中國破壞漢口，與日妥協關稅問題；曾幾何時，日本以事實答復英國曰，是皆吾所俘獲，爾不得染指也。夫在當時，乃至於現在，甚可原諒英法答復之委曲求全；今旣有種種事實說明委曲之無可求全，則除以有效行動答復日本之外，詎復有他道，抑鉅復有他望！云何有效行動，不勝列舉；就事論事，先以滇越鐵道儘量予我國以運輸軍火之便利，以爲日軍悍然在海南島登陸之答復；更自他方力助抗戰，以爲日本昌言消滅我國抗戰力景之答復；此其一二端而巳、</p>
<h3>春節中的世界動態　—自二月十六日至廿二日止—</h3>
<p>舊曆新年，本報依照本港報界决議，自二月十六日至廿二日，停工七天。在這七天之中，本報主辦「香港報界聯合刊」，繼續努力報導，以盡報紙天職。但是篇幅有限，未能盡如所期，且長期訂閱讀者，依例未獲按戶派送，對於最近一週中外時事，恐多隔膜。茲特擇要分折報告，敬希讀者注意。</p>
<p>一、最近七天的戰況</p>
<p>春節七天內，全面戰局尙無重大變化，日×在海南島登陸一舉，不但毫未影響到我們的抗戰大局，而且更加堅定我們持久抗戰的决心和最後勝利提前實現的信念。華南戰區，×人派遣一部份精銳在海南島强行登陸，一面極力縮短廣東戰綫，集中力量鞏固廣州乃及控制北江西江的交通，一面抽調部隊增援　南，進一步造成西犯桂　的形勢，而其主要企圖，則在響意德任歐洲的　的冒險，而試探英法兩的態度。作征服太平洋的準備；同時利用親日反共主義的漢奸，一面誇人日×勢力，一面宣傳日×在粤的『政治』，企圖惑亂人心，便利　作新的進攻準備。但我洞燭其好，一面明白暴露日×進佔海南島威脅英荷法美的野心，使英法各國採取較爲强硬的態度；一面愼重與英勇地實　新的戰略，在東江北江採取攻勢，使×人的兵力續被牽制與削弱，而西江南路的防務，最近亦巳達到完善程度，準備隨時實行反攻，以打破×人的進攻計劃。海南島上，我地方駐軍及由紅軍改編的英勇部隊，殲殺×人近萬，僅—七日反攻定安一役，卽殺傷×軍達一千以上。現全島民衆巳動員準備作殊死戰，他們盼望着國內國外精神上物質上的援助。華北戰場，戰事重心將在黄河沿綫，連日陝豫晋省夾岸砲戰不巳；×軍還在不斷向綏晉三省增援。但査目前風陵渡永濟間×人不足五千，晉南晉東×軍不足兩萬，並不斷遭我太行中條兩區游擊部隊的襲擊殺傷。此外綏察兩省民軍，亦與晉　冀邊區及陝甘寗邊區取得聯終，積極發動反攻，使增援之×遭受阻截削弱。魯東魯北，連日亦有血戰，×第五師團受創極重，現在西北軍事經濟建設激劇進展，國際援助亦頗樂觀，×軍雖然揚言春節後大舉進攻，但我巳有備無應。華中戰區，鄂豫皖三省戰綫對峙無變化，蘇浙×軍與皖贛之×聯合，前者謀分由海陸犯浙東，截斷浙贛鐵路，後者謀南犯南昌，但均遭我截擊，迄未獲逞，同時我軍積極反攻武昌，岳陽及南潯路兩側，使×軍進攻計劃不克實現。此外特別値得注意的，是我國新空軍，在春節中建立奇功，皖東習南×艦×陣，連日遭我轟炸，十五日長沙空戰，擊落×轟炸機七架，廿日蘭州空戰，又擊落×機達九架之多。總之全面戰局，巳日漸趨向於我×勢均力×的第二階段，深信只要我們能够加緊團結，堅持抗戰，力爭政治進步外援進步，則勝利是會提前到來的！</p>
<p>二　參政會三屆大會</p>
<p>國民參政會第三屆大會，於二月十二日開幕，至廿一日閉會，其間除第一二三三次會議，由各長官分別報吿內政外交軍事財政經濟敎育以外，一共舉行了九次會議，先後通過關於內政經濟財政敎育文化軍事國防各部要案數十件，都是適應抗戰建國　階段新需要的决議，其中特別値得注意的：第一是通過了褚輔成等廿四人，王卓然等廿五人，林祖涵等廿一人分提的『擁護抗戰國策案』，並在决議文中鄭重官言：『抗戰旣定方針，必須支持到底，我全國國民，應竭誠擁護政府，執行第二期抗戰國策，我政府應通令全國軍民，服膺將委員長在去年十二月廿六日宣言由所宣示之大義，堅决其意　徹始徹終，以復我領土，主權與行政之完整，而完成抗戰建國之大業』，這决議是全國人民共同要求的再度表示，同時也是全國人民擁護國民黨五中全會與共產黨六中全會全部决議的表示，對于×人漢奸親日反共主和份子，當然是很有力的打擊。第二，關於內政方面，通過了『實行選賢與能澄淸吏治』『加强民權主義的實施，發揮民氣以利抗戰』等案；關於經濟財政方面，通過了『樹立戰時經濟政策以利抗戰而維民生』等案；關於敎育文化方面，通過了『急救淪陷區靑年』『剷除漢奸文字』『培植邊務人才』『溝通各民族間情感建設蒙囘藏特殊敎育』『動員全國知識份子掃除文盲』等案。關於軍事國防方面通過了『擴大空軍設設』等案，不僅與五中全會决議基本方針相合，而且補充了五中令會所未曾討論或未决議的，對於抗戰建國前途自有重大意義。弟三如組織特種委員會以檢討該會一二兩　會議决議各案實施情形之表示該會匪代表全國民意，及政府交　『第一期戰時行政計劃』及『兵役法修正案』之表示政府尊重該會，在我國民主政治史上實佔最光榮的一頁，使人感到莫大的興奮。</p>
<p>三　兩條陣線的鬥爭</p>
<p>我們從這次參政會的議决案，可以看到中國政治巳經怎樣地踏上急速進步的大路了！然而中國巳是世界的中國，今日的抗戰建國的中國的統一戰綫，是世界反法西斯反侵略的民主和平陣綫上的一支主力軍，他的進步，固然將立即影響到世界，而世界的動態，也要直接間接影響我們的抗動建國大業。</p>
<p>國際上民主和平陣綫與法西斯侵略陣綫的鬥爭，在這一週來也有更明顯的發展，首先說我們共同的×人法西斯侵略陣綫，他們正在英法統治者的妥協外交政策下展開更驚人的冒險挑戰。意大利侵略者，巳經非正式的傳出了他們的新要求，卽（一）意大利人口激增，有在法國保護國突尼斯殖民的必要；（二）意大利以大帝國的地位，應『參加』蘇彝士運河的管理權；（三）吉波的應爲意屬北非的一部份。德國侵略者，則更準備新的冒險，『新要求』的宣傳品，巳經遍佈全世界。東方强盜的日本法西斯，則在力謀强化日德意反共集團，上週派出密使赴歐，他們在歐洲的間謀機關外交人員亦正在暗中活躍締結反共反蘇軍事同盟。並且繼進攻海南島之後，又進而大舉轟炸中英邊界的深羅湖；又以本月十九日僞維新政府外交部長陳籙在滬租界被刺斃命，竟又準備武裝奪佔上海租界；顯為日本侵略者實行遠東大冒險的徵兆。民主和平國家方面，英法統治者的態度雖無軍大變化，而且對于西班牙問題，竟巳準備正式承認西仍軍及僞國民軍政府，企圖獲取意德侵略者若干讓步，暫時延緩歐洲大戰的爆發；然而英法反要協政策反法西斯侵略的運動已有更大的發展，到了實際行動的階段，廣大的勞動大衆和各進步政黨及前進正義人士，並在統治階層內展開反法西斯反妥協的鬥爭。這種鬥爭，正在推動英法兩國趨向親密合作之路，趨向鞏固民主和平各國聯合陣綫之路。美國方面反羅斯福份子繼續遭受全美攻擊，反動與論亦未發生效力，十八日晨羅斯福還在金門博覽會上大聲攻擊法西斯侵略者，並號召民主和平勢力聯合起來，制裁共同的×人。蘇聯國防軍事，繼續在飛躍發展之中，外交上又有對立陶宛對波蘭新商約的成立，蘇聯對英新商約，亦在進行談判了。今天（二月廿三日），是蘇聯紅軍廿一週年紀念日，各處都將宣傳紅軍和　聯海空軍的英勇事蹟及其所有力量，各工廠各學校各集體農塲，都將成立練習射擊等技術團體，他們將宣誓：爲保衛社會主義組國　聯，保衛世界各民族解放，及反對法西斯侵略而作殊死戰！這是我們友邦的光榮與偉大，將使我們在抗戰建國的大業進程中感到巨大的興奪與勝利的信念—現在侵略陣線雖然正在準備更大的冒險，大戰勢將有更廣泛更殘酷的演出，然而民主和平陣線亦巳在淮展了，我們要加緊鞭策自己，加緊推動和實現全世界勞苦大衆的反法西斯統一陣綫，向勝利之途邁進。</p>
<h3>對參政會的兩點希望　第三次參政會開幕禮　蔣議長致詞原文</h3>
<p>【重慶航訊】國民參政會，今天舉行第三次大會，中正謹承政府之命，來担任本會議長職務，在全國賢達和老成碩德之前，自問淺陋，殊覺惶恐萬分。但是國家艱危至此，諸位先生披瀝精誠，不遠千里而來，共赴國家民族大難的精神，實在使中正非常感動。諸位旣本着負責盡職，安共仗的精神而來，中正更不敢不以一心一德，必信必忠自勉—希望在本屆會議之中，多多傾聽各位的偉論，願與諸位先生共同努力，以完成抗戰建國的使命。</p>
<p>本會雖然成立不過八個月，對於國家巳經有很人的貢献。在兩次大會期間，諸位對於當前許多內政外交問題，均巳揚出不　的富有建設性的建議。其中有兩件事，尤爲中正所不能忘者：</p>
<p>第一，是本會兩次大會所通過的維護國策的决議，本會在第一次大會中通過了擁護『抗戰建國納領』的决　案，在第二次大會中通過了「維護持久抗戰的國策案」這兩件决議，不只統一了全國人心，團結了全國意志，增强了政府和人民的力量，並且無形中澄淸了國際視聽，消滅了×人的一切造謠離間，以精神壓迫我們的陰謀與毒計，這是最可欣慰的。第二件，是本會參政員除努力參加會議外，還有許多位在會外從事於抗戰建國的實際工作，不論在戰區，在後方，都有我們參政員冒險犯難苦卓絕的努力的成績，使全國國民，得到有力的啓示，知道我們不僅貢獻意見，而且勇於力行尤其是有好多位參政員至不辭辛勞，親赴前方視察軍風紀，慰勞作戰將士，身體雄然受傷，精神始終不懈，更覺可以欽佩。</p>
<p>現在抗戰已經轉入第二期了，我們全國政府人民的責任，格外艱鉅；本會的責任，也就格外的加重。第一期的抗戰奠定了勝利的基礎；第二期抗戰的任務，就要集中發揮我們後方乃至被佔地區內的一切力量，爭取最後的勝利與建國的成功。第一期抗戰，是精神與物質並重；第二期抗戰中、精神的重要，更過於物質。要發揮抗戰的力量，不僅要振作精神，集中精神而且要以精神爲主，物質爲用。必先提高全國國民堅强奮發的精神，然後方能克服艱難，打破×人，完成抗戰的使命。抗戰轉入第二期以後。×人在軍事上，已經是進退維谷，一天天的窘迫，一天天的徬徨了。最近×人側重政治的舞弄，揑造事實，離間國人，無非先要制服我們的精神，分解我們的精神，然後來征服我們整個民族。要打破這種陰謀：我們除了經常注重軍事和物質以外，更要特別注重精神的抵抗力；不條應該動員國內的一切物質和人力，而且要動員全國的精神和意志；不僅發動全國的精神，而且要組織起巳經發動的精神。以有組織的精神，發揮有組織的人力，利用有組織的物質，然後可以　蕩侵略的暴×，樹立戰後建國的永久基礎。這種在務，這種使命，無疑的是中國有史以來　艱　最偉大的。去年臨時全國代表大會决議，召集國民參政會，目的是在集中全國的力量，以排除空前的國難，集合全國的意志，以樹立建　的基礎。我們可以說：國民參政會對國家最大的貢献，就在於發揚我們全國一致的民族精神，提高我們固有的民族道德，這種精神和道德的感應力，直達到各省各縣，直達到文化經濟，每一職業，每一部門的國民，就可以鼓舞起同仇敵愾，不屈不撓的精神，啓示全國國民對于國家民族光明前途的自信，臨到這個抗戰淮入第二期的時候，我以爲強化精神，集中精神，以我們的言論行動，領導全國精神總動員，應該是本屆大會的工作中心所在。</p>
<p>我們要集中國民的精神，就必須使全國國民，對于自身都確立共同的道德同，對于國家民族，堅定共同的信仰。而每一份子能够根據這個共同道德觀念，共同的建國信仰而努力，而奮鬥，而犧牲。這個共同的道德是什麽？就是「捨小我爲大我」。我們的共同信仰是什麽？就是三民主義。根據這個信仰。去實現的目的是什麽？就是我們中國政治最高理想，大同世界。禮運說：</p>
<p>「大道之行也，天下為公，選賢與能，講信修睦。故人不獨親其親，不獨子其子。使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，矜寡孤獨廢疾者，皆有所養，男有分女有歸。貨惡其棄干地也，不必藏于己…力惡其不出於身也，不爲爲已，是故謀閉而不興，盜竊亂賊而不作」。</p>
<p>這是我們建國的目的，達到了這個目的，才是全國人民同享到了幸福，才是三民主義眞正的實現。諸位先生—我們今天一方面是流血流汁在抗戰，一方面是殫精竭智　建國。我們總理孫先生所要建立的新國家，就是要做到禮運所說的大同之治，這一次五中全會宣言中所說的三點，（一）眞誠純一，加强幽結；（二）貢献能力，自由生命于國家積極　鬥；（三）集中一切時間精力，以實行心理建設，政治建設與經濟建設。——這固然爲抗戰，同時也爲建國。我們所着眼的，不僅在目前，更在久遠的將來。我們中國建國的理想，旣然是「人人不私其力，不私其身，勤勞互助和平康樂」的境界，因此我們的出發點必然要真誠純一，聲氣相通，利害相共，眞止做到天下爲公，我們的努力必須是積極的，而不是消極的。同時我們爲增強力量，更必須加緊實行一切有關建國的建設。五中全會的宣言，不僅希望全黨黨員如此做，尤其希望全國同胞，特別是全國社會領袖，一致接受來實行。我們參政員各位先生，都是富有學問經驗的社會領袖，政府一方面以一選賢與能」的誠意，集中全國才智，來共負國家的責任，同時更希望以「講信修睦』四個字，作　團結全國力量的基準。因此我們所誠懇希望于各位參政員同人的，家是人家首先確立互信與共信，一切都開誠相與，盰　相見，這成了和諧親睦，有如一家兄弟手足的態度，無事不可直言，無時不可共諒。一方面要各位盡量的徵取民意，切實的代表民意，充分的發揚民意，知無不言，言無不盡，使政府社會之間，完全相互諒解，融洽貫通，沒一絲一毫的　滯，一方面更希望各位以宏博悲憫之胸懷，實行我們先哲所謂「不獨親其親，不獨子其子」的敎條將一人，一家，一鄉，一地方的利益，融匯到全國與整個民族的利益。我們要　親親之心，以及于敬老恤貧扶助痛苦的同胞，解救國家的危難，我們要推慈愛自家子弟之心，來愛護全國靑年，保育國靑年，給他們以良好的模範，導引他們到眞誠純一共同爲國奮鬥的途徑，以鞏固我民族久遠的生命。我們參政員同人，能以此精神領導全國，我敢說：「抗戰必勝，建國必成一三民主義，最終目的大同世界，也必能實現。</p>
<p>爲要具體說明我個人的希望，我不憚反復的再要提出兩點的意見：我以爲這兩點完全做到了以後，我們參政會對于目前抗戰建國的貢献，將更偉大；我們共赴國難的精神，將更顯著而光明，我們全國賢者能者，領袖人士的精神，能提振起來。打通政府和人民的意志，集中政府和人民的力量，這一種效力較之提高前綫上官兵男敢犧牲的精神，還要大過十倍。我所說的兩站希望是什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，本屆大會。要充分表現積極的精神，我們參政會的產生，不同于通常國家的議會。我們的組織精神我們成立的環境和經過，都是在世界政治史上沒有先例的。而我們過去兩届大會，的成績，盡量避免了普通　會的積習，更是我們足以自豪於世界的。現在抗戰建國的工作，更是迫切，爲節省時間，增進效能起見，我以爲我們要史進一步盡量減少不重要的提案，而多多致力於積極的富有建設性的實際的建議與討論，記得上屆大會爲了原稿審査辦法一案討論許久，消耗了抗戰時期的寶貴光陰。到今天諸位一定很明白我們政府是革命的政府，是具有責任心的政府，而且完全　以民意與公理爲依歸的政府，祗要不違反抗戰建國的利益，政府决沒有理由限制人民的權利，因之我們參政員同人也不必過份爲個人的便利與自由着想，反致忽略了國家整個的利害。我們到了今天，必須盡量發揚我們的積極性，而避免我們過去幾千年來習染很深的消極性，我們過去的國民性，例如懷疑，磨擦，防止，對抗，都是偏於消極方面的，不但不能促進一切的事業，反而消耗了許多有用的精力，阻礙不少的進步，甚至耽誤了國家的大事，我們祗看宋明兩　的滅亡，並不是由軍事的無辦法，也不是絕對沒有我國　民的賢者，只是大家互矜意氣，各立鬥戶，私心自用，主張分歧，遂使精神不能統一，意志力量因此分散，看局部的利益，高于國家的和益，爲個人的自由，犧牲了國家的自由，所以最後造成了「議論未竟</p>

<h3>蔣議長領導下　參政會圓滿開幕　決議各案提交政府採行　國防委會工作緊張</h3>
<p>【本報重慶廿二日專電】最高國防委員會成立後、對抗戰建國大計、及黨、政、軍各事務、積極商討、分交各關係方面執行、現我前後方一切工作、均極緊張、國家將來希望極大、聞參政會决議各案、亦交國　會參考採行、刻各戰塲陣容益固、軍隊之訓練、補充、正依旣定計劃、努力進行、軍事前途大可樂觀、</p>
<p>【中央社重慶廿一日電】國民參政會第二屆會議、於十二日行開會式、共舉行大會九次、通過議决案八十餘　、經過情形良好、結果極爲圓滿、廿一日十時九次會議後　開閉會式、到有居予兩院長、張羣副院長等、中委葉　傖吳鐵　等、及參政員鐘榮光、胡兀談、等一三三八、蔣議長領導行如、後致休會詞、詞畢、全場熱烈鼓掌、次由張副議長、暨參政員代表張、麐致計、衆均鼓掌歡迎、旋卽散會、議節　穆降重、茲將蔣議畏休會式詞錄次、</p>
<h3>蔣議長致休會詞</h3>
<p>張副議長，參政員各位同人：國民參政會第三次，會，舉行於第二期抗戰開始的時候，國内國外，都非常注意我們會議的進行。這，天以來，我們人家本着積極精神，共同　論國家民族的大計，中正在開參時，對於本屆會議所致懇切的期望，幸蒙各位接納。本屆會議中精神團結和衷共濟的精神，唯有用一濟濟一堂一與一雍雍穆穆一兩句成語，可以　示其大槪。中正覩此景象，更增加了對于我民族　途與抗戰必勝的信心，實覺氣限欣慰。</p>
<p>大會雖告閉幕　工作永無休止</p>
<p>這次會議中，一方面政府，院部負責當局，都能坦直許盡的報吿施政情况，得了我們的信賴；同時我們對于一切决議和建議，都能注意到抗戰第二期切實的需要，集中到幾個具體而有建設性的要點，議案的數量不多，而内容很是充實。尤其是許多同人，本於實際參加抗戰工作的經驗，貢獻許多親歷所得的甘苦，提出許多切合實際的意見，足以裨益政府的實施。我們政府與本會之間，如此聲息相通，患難相共，自信必能負起抗戰建國的責任，完成我們抗戰建國的使命</p>
<p>現在第三屆大會閉會了。大會雖然閉幕，我們同人爲國盡瘁的工作，是不會一天休止的。我相信：只要本會能　發　此種積極的互助精神，開誠布公的輔助政府，踏踏實實的去做我們做的事。不但政府可以獲得不少的助力。同時亦必能使全國同胞，接受了這種的慼動，</p>
<p>一致起來努力奮鬥，使我們克×致勝的力量，格外加强，戰後建團的基礎，由此樹立。</p>
<p>參會歷史使命　建立民主政治</p>
<p>在中國的政治制度史上。本會一定可以佔得很重要的光榮的魄位，本會的歷史的使命，是要充實三民主義政治的基礎，尤其是建立永久的眞正的民主政治基礎，這點中正在第一次開會的演詞中，巳經提到了。總理倡導三民主義，其民權主義的最終目的，就是民主政治。一國的人民，如果不能關切他們自身的幸福，管理他們自己共同的　務，就是說，如果人民不能積極參加政治的話他們就不能造成强固的國家。所以世界上最有力最鞏固的政治，一定是建築在民意之上，一定是以人民之利害爲利害，人民的視聽爲視聽。總理的民權理想，是造成一個民有民冶民享的國家，古今中外，理無二致。</p>
<p>抗戰建國成功　端賴全民動員</p>
<p>我們現在一面抗戰，一面建國，要得到抗戰勝利建國成功，絕不能專賴兵力，必須動員民衆的精神，組織民衆已發動的精神，以全國的精神意志力量的總和，來傲前方將士的後盾，來做後方開發的原動力，所以充實軍力以外，得動員民力，更必須適合民意。去年臨時代表人會，所以决議召集國民參政會，就是一方面希望全國的眞正民意，能够籍我們參政員而具體表現，使政府可以了解人民的痛苦，知道人民的希望，作爲施政的依據，同時也希望我們參政員以其　位　望，經代表人民參與抗戰建國的大計，積極的貢献我們才力和經驗，來輔助政府，來振導人民。然後，政府的一舉一動。都能應乎民心；人民的一言一行，都能襄贊政府政府的成敗榮辱，就是人民的成敗榮辱，政府人民打成一片通力合作，抗戰乃有力量，慰城愿乃　實效。由于本會產生的經過，就可以知道我們中國能不能　破×人。求得國家的獨立自由，固然是本會同人的責任，而在這一方面，我們中國能不能在這一個抗戰艱苦的時　。造成眞正的民主政府的規模，爲國家奠立長治久安的基礎，更是我們參政員同人的責任</p>

<h3>對參政會的兩點希望　積第二版</h3>
<p>，兵巳渡河」的慘象。我們今日要爲全國國民與千秋後世立一個好榜樣，就必須以積極性來代替消極性，以醒設性來代替破堪性，以互助團結來代替懷疑和排拒，所以我們這一屆的工作，要多多集中于抗戰後期一切實際方案辦法的建議，要特別提高公忠體國共禦外侮的精神，一切討論和建議，都要貫注以積極　。</p>
<p>第二，本屆大會要充分發揚眞誠純一，互信共信的精神，國家到今大這樣地步，我們坐視不救。將待誰來救？國家民族的利益，我們不愛　擁護，將待誰來愛護？我們必須使個人和國家融合為一。個人的力量，要使成爲國家力量，個人的意志，要服從國家的意志，必先國家獲得自由而後，個人才算能享有自由。我們每個人都以國家民族的利益放在第一位，親要推己及人，相信中華民國的國民，都有愛國的良知，有了共信，就必有互信。我們要怎樣做到真誠純一呢？能爲國家民挨和益而犧牲，纔是真誠；鐵家民族以外，無其他雜念，纔　純一。我們爲了國家死且不惜，遑論其他；我們全體一致站在國家民挨的利益上，官傳要爲國家民族而宣傳，行動要爲國家民族而行動，乃至思想也要爲國家民族而思想。我們在已固要竭誠努力，然而是要締粹的爲國努力，對人對事。要絕對的彼此相信，然後　能發生共同的力量來對付共同的×人，完成我們共同的志願。現在政府中負責人員，如果不是爲了國家民族的前途，决不會這樣任勞任怨的魚實下去，諸位如果不爲了國家民埃的前途，也　這樣辛辛苦苦來共負國難。所以政府和我們參政　的認識，是一致的，目標也是一致的，彼此對國家民族的前遠，抱有共信，彼此之間，抱有互信，這就可以打破一切的隔閡，屛絕一切的成見觀　精誠，實事求是，做到和衷共濟，　危相扶的程度。只要憑這一段精　，任何困難，都可克服，任何事　，必能成功。</p>
<p>以上所貢獻的兩點意思，很平凡，但希望却甚眞摯，中正自抗戰以來，身負重托，精神黨志無時無刻不興我全體同人相感通，現在担任了本會議長，和諸位接　的　會更多，彼此之間，更可以進一步的同心戮力，互相切磋，在這　抗戰建國的重大使命中，得與諸位共同負責，實在覺得感奮而欣辛，祗是自問愚拙，恐不足以副同人之望。以後中正個人如有見不到的地方，或有什麽差誤過失，或言行不一，或有不誠不實，不能盡忠職守之時，務望諸位不吝敎益，隨時糾正，以　毋貨斯職。中正只遷着這一片爲國民之愚忠與赤忱，願與各位思難與同，榮辱與共，一心一德，貫澈始終，以盡我們對　戰建國所負的使命，以答政府和全國同胞的期望。</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>從株州搭粤漢東北上、白天氣候還暖　、入夜便　爲奇寒、竟冷得人　假寐一會都辦不到、但關想到前方將士、不分晝夜雨雪、不計寒冷飢餓、都要躺在戰壕裏浴而苦戰的情景、於是心裏　的似發起燒來、燒得滿體生温、汗流　背、</p>
<p>長沙、火之　、距今快要一個月了、但是車中人仍　絮談論不休、　也許是創巨痛　的一種反映、一會兒車抵長沙、北上須冉換車、夜來天氣奇寒、沒　多少時候、可是長沙站上的軍篷、石、　頂、以及遠的破牆頽　、平原大地等等、都披上一層晶　閃爍的白雪之衣了、</p>
<p>從若干破牆頽垣中、偶爾忽亮忽暗的閃出來幾　火光、我們知道、準是寒雪朔風侵擾　醒的人們、拿他們的樑體餘燼、或扯出他們蜷伏而臥的稻草、正在燒火取暖喲、另有從那茫茫火海的殘骸上、被寒風吹來的一股股煙氣和腥味、倘子不知不覺間鑽進　的鼻孔、好也不理不地讓他呼作罷、若品評其味、追究因、那决定會令你感到萬分的難過、</p>
<p>火車希望明天一早開到汨羅、它早已吃飽了煤飲够了水、等乘客于雪夜中約略憑吊長沙災區之後、彷佛他想將寃頭債主指証出來、便立刻大呼長鳴了幾聲、而將我們朝着×人方向拉去了、</p>
<p>火車準時到了目的地、下車向××部　絡站詢　我　去找的部隊和路向、始悉我第一個要找的人羅卓英將軍、可惜機緣不巧、　天他到××地方去了、當時倒引起我一個念頭、「他到××地力去、長沙條傳他將兼任××省主席、概只是時間問題了吧、」其次離這兒不很遠的××地方、××集團軍長關××民尙駐節該處、關氏前在長城古北口抗戰時、我　在黄樹村訪晤過　、而今又得在戰塲上相見、眞令我十二令興奮！</p>
<p>先打電話給他、承他派一位副官來引路；所過溝渠縱横、田地肥美、麥葉豆花、靑白　　、這副官閒談地說、他從　牆河前綫回來才三天、那里仗火還打得不辨、×人先　把我們壓迫過河南來、但我們還向北推進數十里、而且節　遍着攏它們所死守着的據點去、它們兵力單薄、鬥志喪失、惟知潛伏堡壘、濫放槍砲、縮着頭的烏　一樣、想找他們來殺個痛快的機會也沒有、照這樣看來、粤漢北段的戰況、顯然巳成爲我方稍佔邊勢的相持局面了、不錯、後來看見關軍團長時、他也認為目前是這樣的一個局面、</p>
<p>關氏自抗戰以來、雖在南北各　戰役、屢建寄助、飽經風霜、但他飽滿的精神、發胖的體軀、仍與當年相見時風　無改、他先和靄　答記者關于戰局的問題、站起指着牆上掛着的軍用　圖、從洞庭湖東邊新牆、麻塘等地反攻戰講起、我們是怎樣的順利進展、怎樣的奪還許多戰利、嗣移動手指、經岳陽、臨湘、通城等地、向右下方畫　弧形、然後指着平江說、『×軍從岳陽止面南下受創、復由這路進、企圖迂週我後、可是平江這路、我們亦早有堅强佈置、使它們同樣遭受嚴重打擊、它們現雖對我西北西南、大舉進犯、但兵力不敷、顧此失彼、以致華中戰事漸趨沉寂、並授我以乘虛搗弱之議會、這是×人　二期侵略戰爭中莫可補救的綻、同時、也是我們第一期抗戰中所必有若干優勝條件中之一條件、』</p>
<p>『我們從第一期（戰略）第三皆段（戰役）抗戰經過中、所得血的敎訓、和鋼鐵般的戰果、都在玉成我們第二期——卽自　抗戰向勝利之途邁淮、』他像是登在講台上的大演說家、講題一經宣示、博得如雷家聲、他便滔滔不絕地往下說了、</p>
<p>『我們要認識第一期第三階段所收獲的戰果是什麽、即是、主動的誘×進入更大範圍的至面戰、更長期的持久戰、×人遭受不可避免之失敗、具體說、×人速戰速　的戰略方針、先被我拳破、繼則所施各殲滅戰企圖、又被我一一擊破、旦今後地理形勢特殊、欲求殲滅戰更完全不可能、最近×人又屢次放出速和速結的空氣、其內心之焦急、巳然情見于詞、可是仍被我最高領袖駁斥得體無槪　、完行置諸不經、它自己先顢預地燃燒着戰爭之火、眼見大勢不利、要燒斷自己的生命線，誘致對方　解不成、它當然只可打腫　吧裝胖子，再從軍事上來挺而　臉、</p>

<h3>春節以後如何</h3>
<p>春節，舊曆新年。本報與讀者諸君小別七日，今日　見，覺得有許多話要說。</p>
<p>舊歷新年在本港，炮竹暄天，絃歌週市，歌台　榭戲　酒　，莫不擁擠萬分，真是昇平景象，形容不盡，反省一下吧！我們是不是忘却了：我們的祖國，正在×人無情的蹂躪轟炸之下。我們是不是忘却了；我們的故鄕，我們的父老姊妹，正在×人的鐵蹄與炮火之下掙扎搏鬥　我們是不是忘却了；我們整個民族和自身命運，還沒有脫離萬刦不復的危機！</p>
<p>我們聽到和看到少數同胞在舊曆新年裏的荒淫無恥的行爲。固然感到無比的恥辱和憤懣，但是我們應該同時看到多　僑胞　許多靑年愛國團體在舊曆新年裏截正的工作，如小朋友　利市運動，如國貨展覽，華商國會的年宵　運動，以至如潮州商會在各商家門口揭貼「國難期間停止拜年」公約等等，都能使我們從腥汙黑　中看到純潔與光明，看到中華民族精神與其遠大的前途，因而感到無限的興奮與期待。</p>
<p>春節以後如何？我們就希望大家實行自我批判和集體批判，檢點過去，策勵將來。我們要盡最大的力量，去制栽一般　淫無恥的行爲，我們更要盡最大的力量，去　勵與發展愛國救亡運動的光榮的競賽，我們要集中一切力量，去爲祖國獨立去爲民埃解放去爲大衆幸福而奮鬥！</p>
<p>祖國的同胞自政府當局直至人民大衆，都在空　艱苦危險之中奮鬥前淮着，無論前綫和後方，都在迫急的呼籲援助。願大家趕快嚴肅起來，緊張起來，担負起各目的天職，舞負祖國的期望，無負世界和平正義人士的期望。</p>
<h3>日機狂炸深圳</h3>
<p>二十一日，也就是舊曆的『年初三』，日本飛機成羣狂炸深圳羅湖，造成中英邊境空前慘劇。</p>
<p>日機此次乘舊曆新年狂炸中英邊界，使深圳全墟變成瓦礫之塲，使　百難民慘遭屠殺，這幕慘劇，吿訴我們一些什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，日×此舉。暴露了他們××中國人民與××廣東同胞的眞面目，暴露了×人　奸和親日反共主和份子最近宣傳『日軍實行中日親善』和『廣州情形昇平安樂』等等，完全是無恥的歇詐，完全是惡毒的陰謀。日×的懷柔政策的眞内容已經自己暴露。華南同胞不僅不會受欺，當然更不會××××××××之下屈服</p>
<p>第二，日×此舉，顯　與上週派遣重兵在海南島　陸一事，具有相同的意義　。而且此種企圖是與　法在西班牙問題上對意德繼續讓步的政策互相關聯的　現在英政府已爲×機矗炸英界而提抗議，但是這種抗議需要實力的後援，一種是各國援華　日連動的進展，另一種是我國團結抗戰的堅持。</p>
<h3>關島建根據地案　美衆院激烈辯論　文生要求通過預算　以同樣方式回答獨裁者</h3>
<p>【路透社華盛頓廿二日電】衆院昨激烈辯論關島建立海軍航空根據地案、衆院海軍委會主席文生、要求通過建設海空軍根據地預算五千四百萬美元、并發表演說謂、「美國以同樣方式回答獨裁者、此其時矣、美國若在關島建設海軍根據地、世界當能涸知美國非如其他無準備之國家、終日束手待斃者」、議員費許則竭力反對關島設防、謂此計劃無疑置「刺力於日本喉間」云、</p>
<p>【海通社華盛頓廿二日電】昨星期二日眾議院開會時、太平洋中部之關島設防問題、再經一度劇烈辯論、一議員用白宮名義解釋謂、關島之計劃設防、并非用作目前之堡壘、查此種建築、實為應付將來遠東政局更趨嚴重時期所需、</p>
<p>【路透社華盛頓廿一日電】此間人士觀察、認為意德報紙劇烈　擊羅斯福總統、實欲映托張伯倫為和平人物、而誣羅斯福為黷武人物、</p>
<h3>一九三八年　歐局的教訓</h3>
<p>— 世長譯　M　Osipov原著　節譯自一月號Mosco　W　News</p>
<p>一九三八年的春天,德國用强暴武力的威脅，奪佔了奧大利，使一個七百年來獨立的國家，變爲喪失了獨立的殖民地，同年的秋天，我們看到捷克的分裂，千餘年來努力爭求獨立的一個國家，現在是　鼻息於德國了，雖然張伯倫從慕尼黑回來以後宣佈他巳『獲得今世代的和平』，但是我們所看到的『和平』是：各國瘋狂的擴軍，法西斯領袖的嚴厲抨擊英國，法意關係的交惡，意大利對於突尼斯，科西嘉，吉波的，尼斯等地的要求，德國軍隊集中於波蘭邊境，並且準備完全佔有丹澤和美宏爾，英法在慕尼黑向法西斯國家妥協以後，繼續採取退讓的妥協政策，上年十二月六日的法德宣言，是一個顯清的證明，意大利向法國的挑戰式語調，是法國莫大的恥辱，這是妥協政策直接的結果，侵略者已予法國以打擊，使法國喪失了一個强國應有的尊嚴，但是，法國自己的舉動對於打擊法國於强國之外，是有更大的影響的。至於英國，它也沒有改變態度和政策。它企圖和德國成立關於殖民地問題的說解，可　希特勒要求歸還以前德國所有的一切殖民地，這要使英國與讓祖干尼加因而失去了歐洲大戰後英國最大收獲之一，所以殖氏地問題是很難獲得解决的，南非聯邦總理兼國防部長比魯氏訪問倫敦和柏林顯然是失敗的，雖然英國對於他的任務抱着很人的希望，據法國『時　報』的記戰，比魯氏在訪問英德後，曾經發表談話如：『歐洲現在是趨向於戰爭的道路中，雖然沒有一個國家願意發生戰爭，但是人人都在準備戰爭，國際間嚴，的情勢如果不能够在一二個月内轉變，一九三九年春天有爆發戰爭的可能』。</p>
<p>這是我們『一世代的和平』！侵略者是食得無饜的，他們把巳經在他們控制之下的人民關禁於軍事監獄和集中營，由於内部的不安精形，法西斯國家地位是非常搖動而不穩的。</p>
<p>上年九月德國人民一致表示反對戰爭，公止的觀察家，都認爲當時德國的情形好像是一種非官方的『全民投票』，民衆對於法西斯的戰爭政策，予以有力的『否决』，德國政府對於這個『全民投票』的答覆是排斥猶太人運動，使猶太人遭受種種殘酷的待遇，於是歐洲重新回到野蠻時代和中古時代的黑暗時期了。</p>
<p>今年世界大勢的展望是很陰暗的，中國現在有戰爭，它的殘忍和野蠻是無可比喩的：西班牙的戰爭仍在繼續進行中，而阿比西尼亞的戰爭也沒有完全終了：中歐弱小國家遭受法西斯侵略的嚴重威脅；世界各地又聽到刀劍的摩擦聲，機關槍的發射聲，大砲的轟　聲和炸彈的爆裂聲，雖然歐洲大戰終止以來祗有二十年，現在，巳經又有一萬萬人陷入新帝國主義戰爭的大戮中了。囘想二十年以前，歐洲的人民都狂熱的慶祝大戰的終了，以爲可以享受長時期的和平了。不料二十年後的現在，資本主義的世界又將陷於第二次的大戰，日本破壞九國公約，德國撕毀凡爾賽和約和羅加諾條約，意大利擾亂了地中海和紅海上的均勢，新戰爭的種子巳經散播到世界各處，事實上這種戰爭巳經開始，一日一日的擴大，將成爲較十次大戰還要野蠻的世界大戰！</p>
<p>歷史的演進常常是重複的，慕尼黑替代了凡爾賽，在併呑奧大利和分裂捷克以後，目前的德國正凝視英法的懦怯行動，和沒有防禦能力的和小國家，雖然它對於擴展到『全歐洲的四分之三』的企圖，還沒有成功，可是它巳經　放毒氣，漫佈各地，準備實行侵略工作了。一九三八年的歐局明白的顯出德國是威脅世界和平，挑動戰爭的國家，　然希特助口口聲聲的說是爲和平而努力，近來美國輿論社在美國和英國舉行一種測騐，提出『希特勒　示在歐洲沒有攫取領土的野心，你們相信嗎？』的問題，結果回答『不相信』的佔到百分之九十二。全世界的人們都知道法西斯蒂對於人　的嚴重危險，法西斯侵略者沒有消除以前。是不能獲得眞正的和平的。</p>
<p>德國藉口於『德意志人的自决』，施行奴化歐洲的弱小民族，然而，倂呑奏大利，分割捷克斯拉安是爲的民族自決嗎？同樣的，日本藉口於『自白色帝國中義的束縛中拯救中國』，向中國進行殘酷的侵略戰爭，殺戮平民，强佔土地，這是拯救中國嗎？有識的人士是很能明白的，所以英勇的中國人民團結一致，擁護抗戰，反對日本帝國主義的侵略，以求國家的獨立和自由。西班牙的戰爭也巳進行到第三年了，爲了祖國的獨立，西班牙人民是不惜任何犧牲繼續抗戰到底的。</p>
<p>一九三八年是過去了，併呑奧大利和分割捷克的慘劇，都在那年發生，這固然是法西斯國家的罪惡，但是號　民主國家領袖的英法，也應該負相當的責任的，這是一個　貴的敎訓，希望民主國家及其賢明的領袖們，切記這個敎訓，劃除法西斯的禍患，共謀人類的和平，文化的發展，和世界的進步。</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>〔新年〕前後（一）</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>有些人歡笑，有些人愁苦</p>
<p>士別三日，當刮目相看。本報和讀者小別七天，自不免有很　令人感與興奮的消息急砍爲讀者諸君報道。這裏所要速寫的，就是停刊期內一新年」前後的一般動態：</p>
<p>大動脈跳動的都市港僑胞唯一的狂歡節，畢竟還是舊曆香過年。</p>
<p>「過年」在香港，就像都市的大動脈在加速度地跳動。跳動—跳動—封建社會與資本主義社會的特徵都赤裸裸地暴露出來；「富貴」與「貧賤」兩個極端亦尖銳化地對立着。</p>
<p>交通工具是都市的神經系統；在新年的前後亦急劇地　環着。統一碼頭的「人潮」是一批湧來又一批湧去。輪渡是一往一來地穿梭着。「除夕」的尾渡，還到了深夜三時哩！</p>
<p>電車，巴士，亦像輪渡一樣擠擁不堪。除非能够掏出多幾個銅板，坐上一級，倒還可以少受些擠擁的苦頭。</p>
<p>售年貨的市塲像被攪亂的蜂窩一樣，個個、都是提着大籃小簍的各種貨色在人　中鑽動着。很顯明的，有的是擁着鮮花玩物在兜風，有的忙着的是浊鑒醬醋。</p>
<p>市情鳥敝</p>
<p>「除夕」花市港九熱閙情形是突歷破史的紀錄，但是，這原來是廣大的逃難者在凑趣，主顧畢竟是寥若晨星。吊鐘花，桃花，水仙花，……都是初索高價，直到除夕二時許因其看者多而買者少而賤價求沽了。元旦之晨，記者還在磅巷大安台地方，親見有二大株昨夜未常被邀入高樓大廈的梅花，顏衰色頹地躺臥在一大堆馬桶旁邊好像深深地在嘆息。他們不遠千里而來，亦有幸與不幸哩！</p>
<p>花販的獲利固然甚微，生意之靠述輸至內地亦是因戰事　係而十分冷淡。按一般例俗年初二老板宴請夥計們痛飲一塲。當中必須有鷄，吃過之後，就宣佈新年誰去誰留。今年呢，因戰　影響，內地生意宣吿破產而「得不緊縮辭退店員。『無情鷄』眞的是無情了，可是，包袱打了之後往何處去呢？瞻望烽火漫天的家鄕，香港又多一羣苦人了。</p>
<p>香港的人口是從三十萬突增至一百一十萬，販賣食物與日用品者，當然是利市三倍。食物在過年，　價超過一倍以上者比比皆是。如雞平時每斤是六七來錢，過年可就貴至一元一二角了。又因爲高等難民多了起來，奢華主顧亦增加一羣，因此。百貨公司，酒樓，舞場老板都笑逐顏開。除此之外的生意，的則因戰事而愁眉苦臉。深願僑胞苦撐下去抗戰勝利之好後就讓一切納入正軌中正常發展，而不致於有人歡笑有人愁。</p>
<p>爆竹的世界</p>
<p>從『除夕』起，密集的爆竹聲不斷地擊動人們的耳膜，直至初二日下午，才吿稀疏些兒。昨天初四開市，又是熱鬧起來。在這幾天日夜的騷擾中，眞是氣煞了睡覺不着的人們。</p>
<p>各商家店戶說是爲了「謝神」亦是爲了「撐撑門面」有的是一長串電光炮，有的是一樹烟花，　容易將一　羣行人集中赴來。於是乎，汽車就　笨猪一樣欲進不前，維持秩希的警察先生亦就喊東叱西，大忙特忙。</p>
<p>在路上走，不是『乓』的一聲，使你嚇了一跳，就是爆竹的紙片與火花不客氣地撲上來，有如鑽身于槍林彈雨之中，逃難的同胞不免要聯想到在炸彈爆炸與機關槍掃射之下的滋味。那眞是不寒而慄的囘憶。可是，祖國的懷胞，仍在轟炸之下過活的，仍不知多少呢！</p>
<p>據說往年燃放爆竹還加狂熱，今年這樣還算是因爲戰事的影響而稍減些兒，但是，如此這樣的無謂浪費，有心入還引以爲憾事！</p>
<p>過年的一般習俗</p>
<p>騎樓下的「大燈籠」輝煌着與「霓紅燈」相照映。有善男，有信女，跪在地上向「門口地主接引財神」「梯口土地護佑財神」的紅紙條　香叩頭。還貼了「新春大吉」「和氣生財」……一類的春聯。</p>
<p>「除夕」拜過神，燒了爆竹之後，就在字畫鮮花佈置一新的商店，住家痛一塲飲，而繼之以叉叉麻將。</p>
<p>「元旦」起來，一見面就是互相叩頭作揖說些吉利話。咭片紛飛，廣貼賀年廣吿，自是應有文章在互送禮物，互相拜訪中，『利市』禮尙往來，這正是小孩與僕役的一年中最大的企望。</p>
<p>拜神祭祖繁簡各有作風，玩弄訣術亦各有方　。雖然是生活在『進步』的都市，世世相傳的封建習俗，牢不可破的仍是很多，很多。</p>
<p>勞苦大衆的〔新年〕</p>
<p>以　樓爲家庭，爲睡舖的勞苦大衆在過年是參上加慘的。老板在驅逐行人在騷擾，還有炮竹向他進攻，迫害。人家是艷裝麗服，　苦大衆的衣履儀表，在「元旦』還是一如平日的平來面目。可憐的小乞兒，充滿着無限的希望，以爲將幾句吉利話綴，一首短歌，討錢的牛乳罐或破匣子貼上重紅紙條，就可以博得『富人們』的靑睞，那知道，富人們認定：『眞討厭—給了一個又來一個！消極的給一個銅枚亦是　濟於事！』令他的然望澆了冷水。一次失望，又是一次失望！</p>
<p>擦皮鞋的小孩因爲能够給人家一點「光榮』，元旦的生意就特別好了起來。多　幾雙鞋，多賺幾個銅枚，就是一大羣臉上悽愴的小朋友對於新年的希望。</p>
<p>短衣　褲的一羣，不是在汚穢的地上賭銅　，就是三五成羣，堆在一起賭低牌。還有的是將四方的麻將台擺在店裏或　位之中。以便一面打牌一面做生意，做工夫的亦比之皆是，他們雖比不上安居在高樓大　者那般「寫意」，但是自樂其樂。亦是盡情在「過年」。</p>
<p>「過年」之後將怎樣？夫業的，逃難的，……又是茫茫不知何處是歸宿！</p>

<h3>深圳的血跡</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>舊曆新年的初三在淸晨早上、正當港爆竹喧天、歡聲盈耳的當兒、深圳墟上空、飛來了×機九架、　狂屠殺居民、結下了本年度×我最大的血債、猶復竄越英領空——羅湖、上水、肆意投彈、亂槍殺人、這種瘋狂的無人道主義的行爲、又再諸於第一十一國了、我們暫不語他，且把這筆血債記錄起來、</p>
<p>搭着正午開赴羅湖的火車、到達了羅湖站、一間用紅磚砌成的高大建築物、——站房首先矗人眼簾、房裏面的窗眼　的玻璃、統統都脫掉了、剩下一些半橛的窗、迎風擺動、這是×人機關槍的兇績啊—許多人的性命、都是在這裏斷送了的、</p>
<p>再過幾丈路、用水門汀建築的警察分駐所、也倒坍了、一面巨大而毀了的旗、掛在隔壁的墻上，標幟着這裏的屬士、也落了幾枚炸彈、是×機認不淸楚嗎、那末上水守衞駐兵駐營對開的河面、也落了兩枚炸彈啊、還可以抵賴嗎、</p>
<p>深圳車站的月台、也落了一個彈、沿路給×人用機關槍掃死的也不知多少、車路邊的新沙一堆一堆的墳起、同行的難民所的辦事人告訴我們這就是掩埋遇難同胞、臨時的地方來啊！</p>
<p>沿着路向前跑、一路上、除了我們幾個同業外、祗有琉疏落落往後逃的人、到達了深圳墟、　目都是些頹垣敗瓦、拜×機所賜的、計南慶街落了五枚炸彈、允升　十枚、鴨仔街、東新街、上大街、西興正等街更不計其數了、蘇杭街還給炸斷了交通、警察派出所附近、　彈最多、所裏尾座也給炸場了、新東方旅店、還落了燃燒彈一枚、僥倖教火瞬速、不致釀成大禍、</p>
<p>小小的墟鎮落下了幾十枚炸彈、還會了一寸是乾凈土的嗎？在街上但見拆斷有的電綫縱橫錯綜、屋樑磚瓦、雜亂歪倒、僥倖沒有遭炸的商店、都閉着雙扉、行人寥落、一些餓狗嗅着血腥、亂舐亂跑、蒼蠅一堆一堆、滿佈在道上染滿了血漬的衣服、鞋襪、發出的聲音，一口一口的簇新的棺木、盛音剛殮了不久的死人、橫七豎八的擺在路上一陣腥陣臭的氣味、鑽人人們的心肺裏、</p>
<p>沙深公路道旁的塘邊、擺着一團肉餅、一雙手和一隻脚、已不知飛向何處去、露在地面的腸　、給猛烈的日光，照得昏黑了、還有些零碎的衣服、道旁也仆着一個十七八歲的孩子、側邊放着一個竹籮、湊近一看、唉育、原來是一具給炸得四肢解裂的少女屍身、面目非常可怖、她橫死在×人的炸彈下、在九泉裏也是切齒含恨的、</p>
<p>在警察派出所附近一條橫巷裏、一個老婦坐在　那塌了的屋子哀號着、一面哭一面鎚着心口、還亂挖着凌亂的磚頭、三番四次的嚷着要死、還虧和她同來的極力把她婉勸纔勉强担着從瓦推裏挖出來的東西、一顚一踣的走着、還哭哭啼啼、嚷着他的丈夫、和他的愛兒啊、情象凄酸極了，</p>
<p>在街上碰到了游擊隊中隊長闕明光、他拍着胸脯說、這裏的治安很好、現在沒有一個人敢搶竊一個銅板的、談到×機的轟炸、他咬牙切齒說、×機眞狠毒、一到便拋擲炸彈、連半秒的停留、功夫也沒有、大家都不及逃避的、所以炸死的人員、纔這麽多、</p>
<p>亂瓦堆中、還不知埋藏着若干未挖掘的死屍、二百多條性命、又犧牲在×人的魔手裏了、誰無父母兄弟、誰無妻子兒女、我們忍心看濟、我們的親族白白的給人屠殺了馮、不、我們要立下了最大的决心、跟×人計算這筆鉅大的血債啊、</p>
<p>歸途中碰到了剛從香港歸來的梁費仁縣長、握手寒喧後、我們因爲　趕搭火車、不及和他詢問今後善法的辦法、便匆匆的吿別了、</p>

<h3>從汕頭到西貢　（續）</h3>
<p>— 華游</p>
<p>領取行李去！</p>
<p>上了西貢岸、第一重難關就是走入新客衙料理入口　的手續、已如上面所說、第二重難關就是到衣箱亭領取行李、從前船一靠岸、所有的行李給搬往海關裏去、近來已由七府的僑胞合資（這裏所謂合資是如此的、無論那個中國人一到安南、他們就會在你的入口稅上加抽兩毛錢所謂建築新衣亭費、）建築一座衣箱亭、亭的位置是在海關的後面、你要到那裏領取行李時、須先向他們領取入門證、依照號碼的先後進去、可惜一般華僑都不能按照着那種次序而做、大家都爭先恐後地隮在一起、往往挨受法國人的當頭棒、他們這樣的不守秩序、照我的意思想來、有了下面兩個原因、、不識了——像衣箱亭門口的木栅分了兩個小門、門旁各貼着紙條寫明男女界的路線、　女界的門口、往往混着許多的甲人、這樣就可以證明他們犯了不識字的錯誤。二、缺乏訓練——當他們披此互相擠擁時、你如果站在旁邊的話、往往會使你聽到一些沒有意識的說話、什麼　『如果怕自然不會跑來出外』、當你問他何必這樣的亂擠時、他會不假思索地回答你、「你要快、難道我不可快嗎？一言以蔽之、這種人是無理可喩的、他們旣然不按照次序、自然會挨打的、孟子常說、「夫人必自侮、然後人侮之」、我謂許多華僑之頭顱、常常挨受人家的棍棒、實在咎由自取、</p>
<p>作者的第一故鄉是在西貢員、所以隔不幾年總得回家省親一次、故關於領取行李的手續、知之頗熟、二十五日一早就叫了一個兄弟前往帮忙、當天到衣箱亭門口領取行李證、僥大之幸、入門證的號數是廿一號。因爲行李多、一個人實在拿不來、因此就向衣箱亭裏的一位「媽」（衣箱亭裏的「媽臻」、與新客衙裏的「媽臻」、性質完全不同、蓋一則是辦理華嬌的入口紙、一則是照顧華僑領取行李的事宜。）商量、由了他的帮忙、這才得到那位守門的阿拉伯人的許可、讓我的兄弟跑進去幫忙、（因他沒有人門證、得私下請求、）在裏面找了半天、才能够找到那七件行李、皮箱多已損壞不堪、被包却盡塗着汙泥、幸喜東西不會失落、衣箱亭裏的管理法實在太糟了、那些苦力把行李從輪船上搬到衣箱亭裏、眞如報父仇一般把東西存亂擲亂臥、這是就那班搬運行李而言、東西存在衣　亭裏、並非妥善的地方、如果是網籃一類行李、東西丟得特別多、蓋爲其沒鎖易於被盜也、他如一呷　」等、也往往遭人毀　鎖鑰偷盜一空、甚至整個的皮箱也會不翼而飛、據我的見解、東西的失落、那些司守的人、固然是不無可疑、一般先進去領取行李的人、也難辭了偷竊的嫌疑、蓋東西存在行李房中、任你隨意翻取、守門的人只憑你入門証與行李上面所結的布條（或用紙寫）的姓名一對而已、試問如此辦法、人家是否可隨身多帶幾條布條去結在別人的行李上、多備些鑰匙開啓給關員撿査呢、所以我說、衣箱亭行李的損失、是受多方面的人盜取的、</p>
<p>東西從行李房搬出來　、還須大待些時間、方能過另外一個界綫、這個界綫是由一個安南人用着一枝木棍擋住的、五人一行、過　這個數目、你就得規規矩矩地待他把木棍拖開時方能過去、在這時候、竟讓我發現了一個海關裏的職員（按此人係安南人、）鼻樑上架着一架黑眼　、他竟在行李房的門口把東西亂起來、用手之不足、還假之以脚、他竟「權把海關作操場、戲將箱　做球踢、幸得箱囊器量好、不然的話、也得屁滾尿流呵、他的神氣的確有點不可一時、（不是一世）可惜哩、究竟他是狐假虎威呢、這倒有點美中不足、他的輪郭、明明是一副安南人的典型、但是當你用安南話和他辦交涉時、他却吱哩咕囉地運用着法蘭西的語言、這才使我有點後悔起來、我不該學習他們經鄙棄了的語言、現在再來談談海關裏的檢查員呢、在那裏工作的人員、以蘭西的「馬丹」佔多　、每一個檢杳員旁邊必有一個安南人爲虎作、倀我此次是給一個男性的法蘭西先生檢查、他的行爲可以說法蘭西先生在安南最標準的人物、現在就把他介紹出來、</p>
<p>當我把行李搬到他的面前時、他很神氣地坐在一隻籐椅上一個爲虎作倀的安南人却坐在他身邊翻箱倒篋地把所有的衣服、書籍、字書逐件拆開、給那位法蘭西先生看、稍爲好看的東西、他可以隨意留下來、我所謂留下來、在這裏該下兩個註脚、一、佔爲己有、二、拿去納稅、現在再舉幾個例略述下吧、上次我由北平回西貢省親、就給一位『馬丹』强取去」本像簿、因爲她認那本像簿太可愛了、他說應該讓她拿去、（請參閱禹貢半月刊第七卷第十期拙著西員印象記、）當時竟沒奈她何、有一華僑在香港買了一精緻的小提箱、因爲太精緻了的緣故、也給法蘭西先生看上眼扣留而去、總之、他如果認爲合意的時候、不管用物或是食品、你就得割　讓給她、至於衣服及其他的東西、稍爲完整的差不多都要拿去納稅、我此次到西貢、本擬前付辦學、所以帶了不少的用物而　、像一個已用了兩年多的小座鐘、個洗過多年的瑞典臉盆、一枝手電筒、一領床幔、兩領　被、都得拿去納稅、甚至內子歷年裁做旗袍的縐布碎、也給拿去衡其輕重而徵稅、這實在有點骸人聽聞、當時如果不是爲了其他附帶的物品、那　縐布粹、我眞送給他們拿去補綴破衣、</p>
<p>他們向來慣於强取華僑的行李已如上面所述、此次他們杳到我帶去預備送人的兩隻玉手環、那法蘭西先生竟强取了一隻、那時我　裏獨自思量着行李帶來這樣多、而且當他們開始檢査時嘗對自己說這些東西非納一百元不可、他現在旣然强奪這件玉環、自己雖然有了充份的理由向他索討、但是太費力氣了、因爲過去有許多經驗吿訴我、要想和那些類　　　的關員講情　、那就是大傻瓜、同時又想到這雙玉環從老遠的祖國跟自己跑到這裏、現在就分散了、未免感到有些　伊、當自己這樣思量時、那玉環已恥到他的褲袋裏了、但我一定下主意、等東西完稅後再和他辦　涉、</p>
<p>當我把遍　凌亂的東西往箱裏裝時、竟發現　外的一隻玉環也失踪了、那法蘭西先生因事往別地力去了、所以就向那個爲虎作倀的安南人質問、他總是問非所答地說「把東西拿去納稅呵、」我已　白到他這句話的意義了、於是就把他拉起來、他竟偷竊了那　座鐘置在他的屁股之後、　（未完）</p>

<h3>埠際賽觀後總評</h3>
<p>第一戰</p>
<p>菲律賓足球隊來港作埠際　、於農曆元旦第一次出戰港埠際隊、經九十分鐘的競爭、結果、港隊技勝一籌、獲得四比一的巨人勝利、</p>
<p>在開賽後的十分鐘內、菲隊「高速率」的演出、的是可怕、所以其時的局、尙覺平均、十五分鐘過後、港隊各員發揮已恰到好處、漸成傾於一面的爭奪戰、然菲隊於努力之下、祗失一球而終半場、下半時開　不久、會戰成二比一的緊張局面、自此以後、港隊控制全場、頻取攻勢、終以四比一吿捷、</p>
<p>射球紀錄表</p>
<p>（上半時）</p>
<p>第一球　李惠堂（港）</p>
<p>（下半時）</p>
<p>第二球　李惠堂（港）</p>
<p>第三球　利　斯（菲）</p>
<p>第四球　李惠堂（港）</p>
<p>第五球　阜拉（港）</p>
<p>此役上半時菲隊所得攻門機會、祗有利也斯一次、顯見其前線攻力、殊覺平凡、下半，所得攻門機會亦祗有五次、又俱不命中、反之、港隊所得近門而射之球、達二十次過外、但僅獲十分之四之成功，如此成績、尙非　滿、亦顯見其失機固不少了、</p>
<p>依我看來、港隊得勝、球藝優良固鐵般的事實、但應付高速率的菲、而使他們卒不得逞、似多得力於「攻勢防禦」、蓋前衛線三人、供應掩護、在在得宜、逐於攻勢防禦中策應　後、造成不少可捲之機、、　惠堂的中央突擊、乃因此而收奇效、</p>
<p>港隊各員的球藝、已爲我們所習見、當時觀戰者亦一覽無遺、可毋庸贅述、惟對於菲隊的表、我看出有下列各點、</p>
<p>（一）三位前鋒、進則同時，則同退、傳得多年前港　球隊採用「一字形』的戰略，故此他們進展時，必須短傳近攻、而無遠交突擊、</p>
<p>（二）兩翼常視三鋒之進展爲進展、無旁敲突襲的　人作風、</p>
<p>（三）三前衛擅於盤球出擊、又恃氣力充沛而奔前跑後、　助攻則有餘、助守則不足、</p>
<p>（四）兩內　雖矯建兇憚、但無球來即撞的爽脆脚頭、所站位置亦非得　、</p>
<p>總之、菲隊各員唯一長處是快捷够氣、多數經驗尙淺、惟頂上功夫頗不錯、</p>
<p>此戰兩陣挑成如下</p>
<p>（港隊）</p>
<p>譚均幹</p>
<p>施漢　李天生</p>
<p>梁榮照　狄臣　韓尼維路</p>
<p>侯澄滔　吿山奴　李惠　　馮景祥　阜拉</p>
<p>（菲隊）</p>
<p>堯俄</p>
<p>巴戚高　摩蘭打</p>
<p>華理　　姚吉地　香那地斯</p>
<p>必治　　賽利　喇拉沙拜　夏利地亞　利也斯</p>
<p>第二戰</p>
<p>菲隊在此間三戰、以二十日　二次出戰華　一場演最佳、蓋菲隊在埠際賽時嘗透李惠堂中央突擊的滋味、故對華聯乃改變戰略、採用第三內衛法、姚吉地　責監視惠堂、不理　、彼步亦步彼趨亦趨、因而　堂那種中央突擊的可怕作風、沒法得　、然而惠堂老於戎行、經驗豐富、也能見機行事、在下半時他乃採用墮後戰略、引姚吉地遠出、而由黎兆榮陳德輝雙管齊下、以側擊而克敵、卒以五比三得勝、</p>
<p>上半時三比一戰成平手、但華聯三球之失、至少有兩球譚均幹應負錯失之咎、三前衞初亦未見出色、下半時惠堂改　墮後戰略、攻勢驟盛、弄到菲隊門前、一刻數驚、此亦足見華聯前綫之　有　了、</p>
<p>射球紀錄裘</p>
<p>（上半時）</p>
<p>第一球　喇拉沙拜（菲）</p>
<p>第二球十二碼　李惠堂（華）</p>
<p>第三球　侯　滔（華）</p>
<p>第四球　侯澄滔（華）</p>
<p>第五球　喇拉沙拜（菲）</p>
<p>第六球　喇拉沙拜（菲）</p>
<p>（下半時）</p>
<p>第七球　黎兆榮（華）</p>
<p>第八球　黎兆榮（華）</p>
<p>此役菲隊運用戰略、華聯　能見機行事而　用戰略、遂成爲一　鬥智的球戰、演出乃比較埠際　更覺精彩可。，、</p>
<p>在此役中、我又看出菲隊演出有下列幾點、</p>
<p>（一）守衛各員乃用密集防衞、惟前正衛受惠堂所　制、左右兩前衛又不敢輕身遠出，故其前線所得供應絕少、</p>
<p>（二）前線的打法、仍與埠際賽大同小異、　　衝比第一次更兇、故上半時乃能戰成和局、</p>
<p>此戰兩陣如下</p>
<p>華聯</p>
<p>譚均幹</p>

<p>此戰於昨天舉行、北風極大、球隨風勢、官東狠難，故影嚮各員技術上的發揮極大、</p>

<p>下半時菲隊加勝一球、聲勢極盛、多數觀客、都以爲此　非隊必勝、可爭回一點體面、詎後來港聯形勢好轉、力攻不已、發彈如矢、韋蘭奴華雖極力應付、終以被困過久、　難保守、遂被港聯一氣呵成，連破三關、反以四比一得勝、非隊三次喪師、此恨綿綿、且待四月閒港隊赴非報聘、然後設法雪恥　、</p>

<h3>體格鍜錬應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>（一）雖然多數的運動能同時有發達肌肉、鍛鍋內臟和氣力的功效、列如因肌肉過於落後而欲專門發肌肉或欲使肌肉發達至最完善的地步、則須從事以發達肌肉爲主的運動這種運動與以鍛錬肉臟和氣力的運動梢（差別、　發達肌肉爲主的運動須出全力的百分之六十至八十五、運動次數在上至十五次之間、欲集中於內臟的鍛鍊、則須　重於軀　的運動、祗須出全力的百分之三十至五十、運動次數在十次左右、鍛鍊氣和鍛鍊力的方法不同、鍛鍊氣鍛錬則須習長跑、跳繩等類的運動、時間要長、這種運動本身很較易、但如繼續運動過久、其困難或身體所　的反應不在劇烈的運動之下、　鍛鍊力爲主的運動、則須出盡全力或全力的百分之八十五以上、運動次數在一至三次之間</p>
<p>（二）關於發達肌肉、一般人多注重上身的肌肉、尤其是兩臂和腹部、但是欲使身體肌肉發達至最完善的地步，非先發達腿部的肌肉不可、腿部可以說身體最强健的部份、也是最難鍛錬的一部、　便身聚肌肉發達至最完善的地步、必雖習劇　的運動、如腿部肌肉過於衰弱、就算能勝任劇重的運動、也　受傷的危險、見鍛錬腿的運動、多數能促進全身　環作用、對於心、肺兩部也特爲有益、腿部也是我們身體的基、礎　所　固的建築物　須有堅强的基礎、我們的身體亦如是、欲發達腿部肌肉、雖　測重於劇重的運動、但也不可忽視各種輕易的腿部運動、</p>
<p>（三）我們運動之所以要極重兼施、就是因爲一方面要進代謝作用利血液循環、一方面使肌肉纖維長大、發建肌肉、　種運動也可以說是「內」「外」並進、最適合於體力在中等以上的人、</p>
<p>（四）徒于體　、和器械運動的種類多、我們不能斷定那一種是最好的運務、運動有時也要「對症下藥」或因人而異適合於甲的運動並不一定適合於乙、運動的程序也沒有一定的標準、</p>
<p>（五）動作要澈底、姿勢要正確、運務是要使肌肉一方面有激底俾展的機會、一方面有澈底收縮的機會、</p>
<p>（六）呼吸的方法要正確、無論如何不可停止呼吸、否則　環等統統將受很大的損害、並能引起心臟等嚴重的病症、</p>
<p>（七）運動要常有變化、單就上臂雙　肌一部、鍛鍊的方法已不上數十種、欲使其發達至最完善地的步、　輪流行所有鍛鍊該部的運動、但每次運動時、身體每部的運動不可過三種、此外運動也要有進步、運動的進步一勻面是器械重量的增加、一勻面是重動方式的進步，在那入手運動的時候須內輕而重、　（下）</p>

<h3>拉斷為止</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>是威廉士女士的輕妙諷刺吧。她說法西斯的政治家軍事家應該知道一點地理，或至少一點點幾何，知道兩點之間的最近的距離是直線。照例，政治家對諷刺　能老起　孔來不理，　諷刺當然是也引不起什麽回響的。但似乎他們對於受到諷刺，也有點不甘，無意或有意，往往爲表示其對於有了解，任意發揮具書線的能力。</p>
<p>也許根本有那麼一種地理敎育，對於土地的計算，不是用面積而是用線的。那麽這就使我們無需奇怪怎麽會在地圖上看見有一個線之國。含糊地說起來，其國境北至南，西至東，都約長一萬里，但我們决不要希望從這長與寬約略估計出其土地的面積來，如果我們覺得凡實際的線必有面積，那未這面積的闊，只有長的一百五十分之一，若把這　在四千萬一的世界地圖上，那末西比利亞鐵道的形狀，正是這長闊之比了。</p>
<p>我們知這，有時一條擬想的線，廿足以使世界政治起變動。上次的世界大戰，頗有人認爲由於德國的企圖切斷三S線，而現在地中海畔的風波，也是以打擊三S線爲目的，意大利也是在想另造一由西西里，經蘇丹到索馬里蘭的斜貫北菲的三S綫吧，三S　自然常算作一極重要的線看。可是三S决不僅僅純依賴一條線爲　絡，線的兩旁，實有旗大的背景映照，而線之國是全部只能形成一條細細的線的，不知他們爲什麽好用生命線那一名詞，也許自知只有一條脆弱的線生命　。</p>
<p>線生命的維持是依賴那被批評爲頭重脚輕的海軍，能够把一線生命保持，己自不易，可是做着大陸迷夢的，却要把線去扣繫炸彈。已經把綫　本身脆弱，全置不顧了，却還嫌線不够長。延長線的夢想，原來也是有的，但忽然在這個時候突想延長，　還是互相埋怨的結果。大勢上，這只有帮助扣繫炸彈的作用，可是能否把這延長的弱線，繫牢在一顆小炸彈上，又要看那牽東補西的兵力，能不能拚凑出一點，到叢山之間，去尋覓葬所。這與大陸戰局，無多大關係的一島，就牽制兵力的作用說，還是要在十萬以上的，無久佔之意的說法，出之狡詐之口，雖毫不足信，但也未嘗不是爲無進佔之力預留的退步。</p>
<p>侵佔海南島一舉，對於太平洋形勢的其嚴重的意義影響，這點自然是我們所應明瞭與信服的，但我們同時也得明白那决不能『輕於侵領』所能與的影響。到因非退不可而撤兵時，我們是不能相信其任何　口的　上海譯報週刊的小言中，有一段議論，我們　得是値得介紹的。文中說：『過去日本速戰速伏的政策，是內以聯結汪精衞，外以聯結德國，一起一伏的時時散放和乎空氣。現在他祗有以海南島的進攻，作　他最後的速結的一種企圖。而這一項意見，據英國外次賈德幹的說明，是意國慫恿的，但我甚至懷疑還有汪精衞的意見在內。』目前雖然聽不到汪精　的意見，但若日本撤兵，恐會有汪精衛之流出來說話。不過不一定是和平論，或者簡直是傀儡戲。</p>
<p>汪精　曾做過云廣州做傀儡的夢，那時就曾要求過一个撤兵的騙局。但其連手不高興，大概是認爲這傀儡還不够那麽大。至於『對其本身並無利益』的海南島，又不能『輕於佔領』則也許是會作爲換傀　之用的。然而也只『也許』而已，魄儡若竟抱此希望，却又不免要幻滅。一條線旣然延長了，自然曾引起自以爲　長的錯覺，所以結果也可以是硬拖到拉斷爲止。</p>
<h3>老人</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>老人逗留在岡子上巳經好半天了。當他蹣跚地爬上這面岡子來的時候，太陽晒着還沒正頂，浮蕩着一兩塊浮雲的大空是那麽的湛藍，那麽的高遠；但如今，太陽已西斜到滾流着渾濁河水的松江那岸的旗山嶂的頂上去了，一片美麗的晚霞正幽靜地在金黃的夕照中反射了出來。老人却還儿自坐在岡子上茫然地啜吸着旱煙，讓破碎的沉重的心，盡在翻騰着無休止的悲哀浪潮。</p>
<p>老人，……老人的一生是貫織了無盡數的辛酸和苦難的緯絡的，……</p>
<p>從幼小的時候，老人就一直在貧困裏受着磨難，他起初就和早寡的母親艱辛地耕種着人家的田地，好些年後的有一天，母親在工作時候　然倒下田裏死了，他從此就一個人耕種了五六個人工作的田地，那樣，千斤的石　壓得他幾乎透不過氣來，但他却祗是用藥酒擦擦周身，一直低頭嗅息着坭土的氣味，到差不多四十歲，他才娶來了妻子作帮手，他由是逐日變得更加老邁了，却幸那唯一的兒子長大起來而目也像他當年一樣客忍地不發怨言地握緊了鋤須。這樣，在受盡了一切辛酸的苦難之後，老人稍爲感到小小的安慰了。因此，在有時不寢的夜裏，在工作偷閑中支起鋤柄矚望着兒子了結實的臂膊者在日光下揮動的時候，一陣笑痕輕輕從老人乾枯的嘴角邊浮綻出來了。</p>
<p>然而，意外地……那眞是橫暴的意外喲：就像一陣急雨狂風的打碎了艱難地剛從棘叢中伸頭出來的小花，老人的一綫安慰也忽然的被摧毀得粉碎了。</p>
<p>今天早上的事，是老人想着也得從背脊骨裏緩流過一道戰慄的寒流的，……</p>
<p>兒子天沒亮就爬起來，朝水缸裏　了些水隨便擦了擦臉，就拿起昨夜乘黑磨起的鐮刀到出裏除草去了，早飯後才泥手泥脚的走回來，却又提着魚網走到屋後的大塘裏撈魚去了了。</p>
<p>就是那麽時分，鄕公所裏四支『木殼』指着了老人的家。</p>
<p>這是要兒子征兵去的。</p>
<p>可　這怎麽能够呢？</p>
<p>『我　有這個兒子呀！</p>
<p>沒有他！我們就得活活餓翔了』。老人哀哀申辯着。</p>
<p>而且，這麽的村子裏，有　三四個兒子的人家不正是多着嗎？</p>
<p>然而，鄉公所是不管這些的……</p>
<p>「去不去？不去……抓，」</p>
<p>兇騰騰地拍着桌子，四支鎗這麽一指，隨你是單醒獨子也得跟　走了。</p>
<p>是綁架？是掠奪？</p>
<p>老人頽然地跌坐在桌上，眼前浮起了一片烏黑，一片亮靑，一團竄亂的金光。</p>
<p>老妻沙聲地號哭着，扯去了頭巾，將頭撞着壁咯咯的作響。</p>
<p>一團極其混亂的思潮交織着在老人頭腦裏急劇旋轉——老人突地圓睜起了怕人的眼睛，一語不發地搶出了大門，蹌蹌踉踉的踏上了曲折的村路跑到鄕公所裏去了。……</p>
<p>然而，鄉長却是巍然地坐在椅子上，「錢」！他脫。沒有錢，他是壯嚴得難以動說的。老人就這麽的被拖扯出了鄉公所的大門，而且「木殼」的柄還那麽的在他頭上敲擊了下。</p>
<p>一股憤怒挾雜着一股辛酸，然而老人流不出眼淚了，他祗是默默地呑下了難以報償的仇恨，那麽的茫然地踏上了歸程。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>由對聯說起</h3>
<p>— 丙辛</p>
<p>×人的心思魔力，眞是像水銀　地似的無孔不入了。在淪陷區，不止在物貫生活方面都要受狄人的宰割，甚至宗敎信仰，×人也無孔不入的鑽營，藉思毒化，據前日報載：</p>
<p>「上海特訊，僞市府以民間送灶明近，彩印灶神像十萬張，送四郊住戶，上嵌日華滿合作九族協和之標語，及敬竈舒誠長慶三餐果腹，睦鄰有道正祝五福臨門對聯……」</p>
<p>這是奴才們一貫的諂媚主子的作風，毫不足奇。</p>
<p>本來通常的送灶對聯，在北方多是寫着：「上大言好事，下界保平安」，似乎在敬鬼事神之餘，還沒有速離開天下國家等想念，但是　兩句話在×人的奴才和走狗之前，確留有諂媚丰子。孝敬主子的好機會，當然在目前的淪陷區，×僞勢力之下，毫無「平安」可言，那麽當二十三晚送灶神的時候，說不定由于事鬼敬神而　引到國家之思上去，于是聰明媚主的奴才，就想出了這一條好計，使淪陷區的同胞依舊在甚麽「日華　合作」或「睦鄰有道」上打轉想，暫時麻醉。</p>
<p>像這樣的事，是不乏先例的，記得「九一八」事變的那年冬天歲慕，日本人也曾强迫全東北住戶，黏貼日本警察特製的春聯寫甚麽「融和東亞民族一心一德，建設新興國家共存共榮」，橫聯是「皇恩浩蕩」。其實出計劃策的依舊是做狗的奴才們，寫字出來手筆的仍然是中之人。漢奸走狗之該殺，於此更得一可靠之理據了。</p>
<p>近來有一派人常是不惜筆墨與心血的諍辯　「主和卽漢好」的幾　字，在文字表面上，雖然是口口聲聲否認有奸之嫌，不過從「愈辯愈有鬼」的俗話看來，他們心虛胆怯之態，已經完全披露無遺。其實「主和即漢奸」的幾個字還是一句待解釋可引伸的一句話，假使眞的像大風雜誌第廿七期的停戰條件，我們是絕不會閉上談判之門的，不過可注意的却是明明我們沒有戰敗，而一幫奴才們却一口咬定說我們戰敗了，明明是不能妥協求和的，但他們却先期在×人處講好了條件，做好了鬼計，硬回四萬萬七十萬國民額上打亡國奴的印號，這才却是百分之百的奴才作風。</p>
<p>×人的技倆在今日似乎都用窮了，因爲無論是硬的，軟的，他們都用遍了，極可注意的却是爲虎做倀的奴才們，他們有用不窮使不盡的獻媚劃策毒害中國的方法，他們能興風作浪，但也會抓題目做引伸附會之言，迷惑羣衆，麻醉羣衆。不過若從上海一市府的獻媚印灶神像和對聯說起，也可以推得奴才們的居心同獻媚中作風，舉一反三，其他的　才們的今後行動，大槪也可以測知一二了。</p>
<h3>小小的意見</h3>
<p>— 友狄</p>
<p>地無分南北，人無分老幼，都要爲抗戰而努力，因而本港文化界也一樣的需要站在自己的岡位展開工作。在這裏的文化工　課題，也是需要集中力量于掃蕩漢奸和爭取落後者一致向上，推進和配台另外部門的工作，在打倒民族×人，完成民族解放的目標下發揚自己的武噐的威力！</p>
<p>以前，一切的工作課題還沒有作爲課題去觸動，工作散漫而凌亂。尤其是在「汪事」發生之後，更加顯得工作的不够和力量的貧困！所以，在當前提起的　築文化界統一戰線問題，應該吸引住全港文化工作　的靦線和力量，關於這個重大的問題，實在有廣汛討　的必要。在這裏，我想發表一點小小的意見。我的意見是：組織要廣大，工作要細分；以團結來展開工作，以工作來鞏固　結。</p>
<p>第一：從字面看來，「文化統一戰線」就非是文化界廣大的結合不可。假如組織範圍　，只配　做『戰點』，它之　還有不少的點，這不成—積點成線，要的是一切點的攏集起來，站成一個橫排，每人桿槍向着前方×人瞞準，無分前後，一齊發彈，這就是戰線了。不但有主腦，重要的還是要有部隊，不但一切進步的有活氣的新人都集　戰綫上，還要打　門戶，把落後者也吸引進來，把他們轉變過來，因爲他們的脚是站穩在另一羣體之中的，假如他們也好好的幹，收穫也就很不少了。不如此。便不成爲『統一戰綫』。但「統一戰線」不是「一品窩」，戰綫內有了頽唐和叛變分子，有了轉變不來的分子，却要　不姑息地淘汰去；否則連『戰綫』也够不上的。這是組織要廣大的軍要注脚。</p>
<p>第二：有了組織有工作，工作的原則需要大家共同確定，定立了綱領；但工作的具體却非分工不成了。世界上並沒有一個「通大曉』，所每一個人只好擇其所熟習的而爲之。在戰　之內，分工不妨分得最細，成立許多特殊的研究和工作部門，工作者可以有他的經常努力的地方。然而一切部門需要有緊密的繫，地可使一切的工作爲了同一的目的。在現在，華威先生型的工作者，最好不給他以估動的機會，工作是一便能「穩穩紥好」，「通大曉」們不但幹而不精，實在是幹而不能。所以，工作要　分。</p>
<p>第三：組織旣然廣大，內部團結就成了重大問題，戰線內要　縱的系統，更要有　的聯絡每個成員是一便個鐵環，連絡而成一條鐵練，一條　的綫，這才能够鬥爭，不但每一個部門之內要有團結才能工作，各個部門，換言是整條戰錢，更要有最大的團結才能使工作有計劃的進展，就現存的團體而言，唯一的缺點就是拉雜成軍，參加者還沒有認識誰是同志，散沙般的情况，是無法工作的，同時，我們更作進一步的考察，還可知道團結起一個廣大的戰綫只靠集會的方式是很不够的，要每一個成員都參加了工作，都能　工作中獲得　鬥的眞正意義。而在工作的過程中，使各人都　獲得集體的檢討，批判，和指導，在這種每個人迫切的需求下，必然產出了最緊密的團結，反之，沒有工作，便無從把各式各樣的人，把相瞰不相識　人團結一起，這時候，戰綫內的成員，在集會便是同志，散會後便是相團體無關的個人。而團體也剩下了招牌吧了—所以，團結和工作有着密切的關連，不能團結便沒法工作，沒有工作也團結不來，唯一的口號是：以團結來展開工作；以工作來鞏固團結。</p>
<h3>知識青年的出路</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>本來，我國壯丁很多，兵源根本不成問題，用不着知識靑年荷槍加入行伍，所以宋美齡女士最近會發表一文，說學生在戰時只要直接或間接去喚醒國人的抗戰意識，並且改進民衆生活，也就够了。</p>
<p>然而這話。是宋女士愛護知識靑年之意，也就是說，知識靑年報國之途，有更甚於當兵的地方，並不是說他們絕對不須當兵。所以我們假使將她的說話，和蔣委員長前日勸黨政人員子弟踴躍從軍的通令，合而觀之，就可以發見他們的用意，正復相同：每一個知識靑年，都應該負起救國的責任，或上前線打仗，或在後方從事救國運動。黨政人員子弟，當然都是知識靑年。抗戰以來，雖然像蔣經國的領兵打仗，馮副委員長的大公子戰死南苑，足以爲這些子弟表率，而其他醉生夢死，或者燕居享樂的，一定還是多數。蔣委員長要他們一槪入伍，非但爲人民樹立榜樣，也因此而增强抗戰的實力，實在爲知識靑年淸楚地指定了報國的另一途徑。我們維護這一主張。</p>
<p>我想，每一個知識靑年，能上前綫打仗的，就上前綫打仗，能在後方活動的，就在後方活動，實是他們現在應走的兩條路。讀書，用功讀書，在踝外極盡可能之力，從事救國，當然也可以歸入後方活動的範圍內。知識靑年珍重着吧，不要放棄了自己的責任。</p>
<p>不過我個人的意見，知識靑年與其在後方盡力，還不如上前綫盡力。因爲躲在後方，總不免有規避的嫌疑，要發生放棄責任的流弊。他們一上前線我想他們的影響，不論在前綫或後方，一定很大。蔣委員長的通令，也許正有些慨乎言之的意味在內吧！</p>

<h3>How England and France Responded to Japan</h3>
<p>Since Japanese troops have already landed on Hainan Island in our country, the British and French ambassadors to Tokyo successively questioned Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, requesting an explanation. The content of the British and French questions has not been published, and we have no way of knowing the details; however, purely within the scope of diplomacy, the treaties, agreements, and declarations that can be relied upon, as well as the promises repeatedly made by Japan, are not only rich in data but also full of arguments, which cannot be evaded by the other party through sophistry. However, judging from the Japanese government's public statement of Foreign Minister Arita's response to the British and French ambassadors, it seems that the two ambassadors did not make every effort to argue based on diplomatic principles. Perhaps, being keenly aware that diplomacy is ineffective, they did not want to waste words; they only questioned as a matter of international practice, barely fulfilling their duties to the minimum extent within the scope of diplomacy. However, judging from common sense and reason, is it not better to force the other party to engage in deception and prevarication than to do nothing? If so, why bother to do this? Or, knowing that the other party will inevitably engage in deception and prevarication, instead of confronting them with righteous and stern words, they only bow and offer their questions. Our country encounters outright plunder, while England and France encounter subtle extortion. The methods of what they encounter are different, so our country is forced into悲壯, ××××××, but both are the most sympathetic countries in the world today. Our War of Resistance has lasted for more than eighteen months. How can we get the British and French governments and peoples, ××××××××××××, to actively engage outside the scope of diplomacy?</p>
<p>After questioning, what will England and France do next? Saying that diplomacy is ineffective, how do we know that diplomatic skills will not be exhausted? Thus, not only is Arita's reply predictable to anyone with a little experience, but the extreme of hypocrisy and deception is not unexpected; even if further protests are made, they will inevitably be as fruitless as expected. Did Arita not say that Japan has no territorial ambitions for Hainan Island? What is territory? The Northeast is our country's territory, but Japan's oppression, exploitation, and various forms of autocracy and manipulation in our Northeast are far greater than what their warlords can impose within their three islands. Japan still keeps saying that it is the "Manchukuo," and Japan has no territorial ambitions. By analogy, Japan does not necessarily have to say that it will seize Hainan Island as territory. Did Arita not also say that the timing and nature of the occupation of Hainan Island do not exceed military needs? Japan's war against China has nothing to do with one island, yet it uses military needs as an excuse to occupy it. With the endless arms race in the international community today, how can there be a day when this island is not needed? As international relations become increasingly tense in the future, can it not be said that it is needed for the so-called "lifeline of the empire," the so-called "New Order in East Asia," and the so-called "Peace in the Pacific"? Questioning a hundred times, protesting a hundred times, will result in two hundred such replies. One of their intentions will be that there is no need for such replies; Japan will have achieved slight success in China, and its operations will have taken deep root. The fertile land of forty million square miles, the forty-five million people, and our country's resources, materials, and manpower will all be used for their expansionist ambitions without any regard for the world. The European and American countries will swallow their anger and, with the utmost spirit of freedom and the most peaceful methods, willingly withdraw from East Asia. England and France will no longer question Hainan! Their intention is not far off; the day when the totalitarian countries have grown their wings will be the time when democratic countries ××××. Annam, Borneo, Burma, the Philippines, ××××, Hainan Island is just the beginning.</p>
<p>In Arita's reply, there is also a noteworthy hint. He said that the Japanese troops landed on Hainan Island to "weaken General Chiang's resistance force and hasten its downfall." This is another deceptive talk. The weakening is Japan's diversionary tactic, weakening its own forces of aggression. But what can be clearly proven is that the fate of Hainan Island cannot be changed by your diplomatic questions, and the fate of Hainan Island is determined by the War of Resistance led by Chairman Chiang. With this hint, if England and France are not comfortable with Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, the only way is to use the greatest determination, the strongest perseverance, and the quickest method to assist our country's War of Resistance to the greatest possible extent. France once worried that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island would threaten Annam. Therefore, disregarding our country's right to transport goods according to the Sino-French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Treaty, disregarding the resolution of the League of Nations to provide as much assistance as possible to China to prevent the weakening of China's resistance force, disregarding the opportunity for economic prosperity in Annam, disregarding the profits from the transport of goods on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and disregarding the most friendly relations between China and France, France accepted Japan's demand not to transport our country's military supplies. How long has it been? Japan replied to France with the fact that Japanese troops had landed on Hainan Island. England once hindered China's destruction of Hankou for immediate petty profits and compromised with Japan on tariff issues. How long has it been? Japan replied to England with the fact that these are all our spoils, and you cannot interfere. At that time, and even now, England and France's compromise and appeasement are very understandable. Now that various facts have shown that compromise cannot achieve peace, there is no other way than to respond to Japan with effective action. What effective action? There are too many to list. Focusing on the matter at hand, first, use the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to provide our country with the convenience of transporting military supplies as much as possible, as a response to the Japanese troops' brazen landing on Hainan Island; furthermore, vigorously assist the War of Resistance from other aspects as a response to Japan's claim to eliminate our country's resistance force. These are just two examples.</p>
<h3>World Dynamics During the Spring Festival—From February 16th to 22nd—</h3>
<p>For the Lunar New Year, this newspaper, in accordance with the resolution of the Hong Kong press, will cease publication for seven days from February 16th to 22nd. During these seven days, the "Hong Kong Press Joint Publication," organized by this newspaper, will continue to work hard to report news in order to fulfill its duty as a newspaper. However, due to limited space, it may not be able to meet expectations, and long-term subscribers may not receive home delivery as usual. There may be much unfamiliarity with recent Chinese and foreign affairs in the past week. Therefore, we will selectively analyze and report, hoping that readers will pay attention.</p>
<p>1.  Recent Seven-Day Battle Situation</p>
<p>During the seven days of the Spring Festival, there were no major changes in the overall war situation. The Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island not only did not affect our overall War of Resistance but also further strengthened our determination to persevere in the War of Resistance and the belief that final victory will be achieved sooner. In the South China theater, × people dispatched a part of their elite to forcibly land on Hainan Island, striving to shorten the Guangdong front, concentrating their strength to consolidate Guangzhou and control the traffic of the North River and West River, and dispatching troops to support×南, further creating a situation of westward invasion of Guangxi and ×南. Their main attempt is to echo the adventure of the German × in Europe and to test the attitudes of England and France, preparing for the conquest of the Pacific; at the same time, they are using pro-Japanese and anti-communist traitors to exaggerate the power of the Japanese × and promote the "politics" of the Japanese × in Guangdong, attempting to confuse people's minds and facilitate ×'s new offensive preparations. But we have insight into its good intentions, exposing the ambition of the Japanese × to occupy Hainan Island to threaten England, Holland, France, and the United States, so that England and France have adopted a tougher attitude; at the same time, we carefully and bravely implement a new strategy, taking the offensive in the East River and North River to continue to contain and weaken the × people's forces, and the defense of the West River South Road has recently reached a perfect level, ready to implement a counteroffensive at any time to break the × people's offensive plan. On Hainan Island, our local garrison and the brave troops reorganized from the Red Army have annihilated nearly ten thousand × people. In the counterattack on Ding'an on the seventh day alone, more than one thousand × troops were killed or wounded. Currently, the entire island's population has been mobilized to prepare for a desperate battle, and they are looking forward to spiritual and material assistance from home and abroad. On the North China battlefield, the center of the war will be along the Yellow River, and continuous artillery battles have been fought on both sides of the river in Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces; the × army is still constantly reinforcing the three provinces of Sui, Jin, and Jin. However, it is found that there are less than five thousand × people between Fenglingdu and Yongji, and less than twenty thousand × troops in southern Jin and eastern Jin, and they are constantly attacked and injured by our Taihang and Zhongtiao guerrilla troops. In addition, the militia in the two provinces of Sui and Chahar have also established contact with the Jin × Hebei border area and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, actively launching counterattacks, causing the reinforcements × to be intercepted and weakened. In eastern and northern Shandong, there have also been bloody battles in recent days, and the × 5th Division has been severely damaged. Now, the military and economic construction in the northwest is progressing rapidly, and international assistance is also quite optimistic. Although the × army has claimed to launch a large-scale offensive after the Spring Festival, we have prepared for it. In the Central China theater, the front lines of the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui are unchanged, and the Soviet-Zhejiang × army and the Anhui-Jiangxi × are united. The former intends to attack eastern Zhejiang from sea and land to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the latter intends to attack Nanchang from the south, but both have been intercepted by us and have not succeeded. At the same time, our army is actively counterattacking Wuchang, Yueyang, and both sides of the Nanchang-Xunyang Road, so that the × army's offensive plan cannot be realized. In addition, what is particularly noteworthy is that our new air force has established a remarkable feat during the Spring Festival. The ×艦×陣 in eastern Anhui and southern习 has been bombed by us for days. In the Changsha air battle on the 15th, seven × bombers were shot down, and in the Lanzhou air battle on the 20th, as many as nine × aircraft were shot down. In short, the overall war situation has gradually trended towards the second stage of our × strength equilibrium×, and we firmly believe that as long as we can strengthen unity, persist in the War of Resistance, and strive for political progress and foreign aid progress, victory will come sooner!</p>
<p>2.  The Third Session of the National参政会</p>
<p>The third session of the National参政会 opened on February 12th and closed on the 21st. In addition to the first, second, and third meetings, in which the heads of various departments reported on internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, finance, economy, education, etc., a total of nine meetings were held. Dozens of important bills on internal affairs, economy, finance, education, culture, military affairs, and national defense were passed successively, all of which are resolutions that meet the new needs of the stage of the War of Resistance and nation-building. Among them, what is particularly noteworthy is that the first is the passage of the "Supporting the National Policy of War of Resistance" proposed by Chu Fucheng and other 24 people, Wang Zhuoran and other 25 people, and Lin Zuhan and other 21 people, and the resolution solemnly stated: "The established policy of War of Resistance must be supported to the end. All the people of the country should sincerely support the government and implement the second phase of the National Policy of War of Resistance. The government should order the military and civilians of the country to follow the great righteousness declared by Chairman Chiang in his declaration on December 26th last year, resolutely and thoroughly to recover our territorial, sovereign, and administrative integrity, and to complete the great cause of War of Resistance and nation-building." This resolution is a re-expression of the common demand of the people of the country, and it is also an expression of the support of the people of the country for all the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party, which is certainly a powerful blow to the × people, traitors, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and peace-seeking elements. Second, regarding internal affairs, the "Implementing Selection of the Wise and Able and Purifying Officialdom" and "Strengthening the Implementation of the Three Principles of the People, Giving Full Play to Public Opinion to Benefit the War of Resistance" were passed; regarding economy and finance, the "Establishing Wartime Economic Policies to Benefit the War of Resistance and Maintain the People's Livelihood" was passed; regarding education and culture, the "Emergency Rescue of Youth in the Occupied Areas," "Eradicating Traitorous Writings," "Cultivating Border Affairs Talents," "Communicating Emotions Among Ethnic Groups and Building Special Education for Mongolia, Hui, and Tibet," and "Mobilizing Intellectuals Across the Country to Eradicate Illiteracy" were passed. Regarding military affairs and national defense, the "Expanding Air Force Establishment" was passed, which not only conforms to the basic principles of the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session but also supplements what the Fifth Plenary Session had not discussed or resolved, which has great significance for the future of the War of Resistance and nation-building. Third, the organization of a special committee to review the implementation of the resolutions of the first and second meetings shows that the association represents the national will, and the government's submission of the "First Phase of Wartime Administrative Plan" and the "Amendment to the Military Service Law" shows that the government respects the association, which occupies the most glorious page in the history of democratic politics in our country, making people feel great excitement.</p>
<p>3.  The Struggle Between Two Fronts</p>
<p>From the resolutions of this参政会, we can see how Chinese politics has embarked on a path of rapid progress! However, China is China of the world, and today's united front of the War of Resistance and nation-building in China is a main force on the world's anti-fascist and anti-aggression democratic peace front. Its progress will immediately affect the world, and the world's dynamics will directly and indirectly affect our great cause of anti-resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>The struggle between the international democratic peace front and the fascist aggression front has also become more evident this week. First, let us talk about our common × people's fascist aggression front. They are launching more astonishing adventures and challenges under the compromise diplomatic policies of the British and French rulers. The Italian aggressors have already unofficially announced their new demands, namely: (1) The Italian population is increasing sharply, and it is necessary to colonize the French protectorate of Tunisia; (2) Italy, as a great empire, should "participate" in the management of the Suez Canal; (3) Gibraltar should be part of Italian North Africa. The German aggressors are preparing for new adventures, and propaganda for "new demands" has spread all over the world. The Eastern robber Japan's fascists are trying to strengthen the Japan-Germany-Italy anti-communist group, and sent secret envoys to Europe last week. Their spy agencies and diplomats in Europe are also secretly active in concluding anti-communist and anti-Soviet military alliances. In addition to attacking Hainan Island, they have further bombed Shenluo Lake on the Sino-British border; and with the assassination of Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the puppet维新 government, in the Shanghai concession on the 19th of this month, they are preparing to seize the Shanghai concession by force, which is a sign that the Japanese aggressors are carrying out a Far East adventure. On the democratic peace countries' side, although there has been no major change in the attitude of the British and French rulers, and they are even preparing to formally recognize the Spanish army and the pseudo-national army government in order to obtain some concessions from the Italian and German aggressors and temporarily delay the outbreak of the European war; however, the anti-appeasement policy and anti-fascist aggression movement in England and France have developed further and reached the stage of practical action. The broad masses of workers and various progressive parties and progressive justice figures are also launching a struggle against fascism and anti-compromise within the ruling class. This struggle is promoting England and France to move towards closer cooperation and to consolidate the united front of democratic peace countries. In the United States, anti-Roosevelt elements continue to be attacked throughout the United States, and reactionary theories have not been effective. On the morning of the 18th, Roosevelt loudly attacked fascist aggressors at the Golden Gate Exposition, calling on democratic peace forces to unite and sanction common × people. The Soviet Union's national defense and military affairs continue to develop rapidly, and new commercial treaties have been concluded with Lithuania and Poland in diplomacy. A new Soviet-British commercial treaty is also under negotiation. Today (February 23), the 21st anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, will be publicized everywhere, showcasing the heroic deeds and all the strength of the Red Army and the Soviet Union's naval and air forces. Factories, schools, and collective farms will establish technical groups for practicing shooting and other skills, and they will swear: to defend the socialist ancestral homeland of the Soviet Union, to defend the liberation of all nations in the world, and to fight to the death against fascist aggression! This is the glory and greatness of our friendly country, which will make us feel a huge thrill and the belief in victory in the process of our great cause of War of Resistance and nation-building. Although the aggression front is preparing for greater adventures, and the war will inevitably have a wider and more brutal performance, the democratic peace front has also been expanded. We must intensify our own efforts, accelerate the promotion and realization of the anti-fascist united front of the working people of the world, and move towards the path of victory.</p>
<h3>Two Hopes for the National Political Council; Opening Ceremony of the Third National Political Council; Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Dispatch] The National Political Council held its third general assembly today. I, Zhongzheng, acting under the government's mandate, have come to assume the chairmanship of this council. Before all the wise and experienced leaders of the nation, I feel deeply inadequate and apprehensive. However, with the nation in such dire straits, and with all of you gentlemen exhibiting such sincerity and traveling great distances to address the national crisis together, I am truly moved. Since you have all come with a spirit of responsibility and dedication, I dare not but encourage myself to be single-minded in purpose, and faithful in action. I hope that in this session, I will have the opportunity to listen to your profound insights, and I am willing to work with all of you to fulfill the mission of resisting the war and building the nation.</p>
<p>Although this council has only been established for eight months, it has already made significant contributions to the nation. During the two previous sessions, you have all put forward many constructive suggestions on a variety of current domestic and foreign affairs issues. Two things, in particular, I cannot forget:</p>
<p>First, it is the resolutions passed by the council in its previous two sessions to uphold national policy. In the first session, the council passed a resolution supporting the "Guiding Principles for Resisting the War and Building the Nation," and in the second session, it passed the "Resolution on Upholding the National Policy of Sustained Resistance." These two resolutions not only unified the hearts of the people across the country, united the national will, and strengthened the government and the people, but also clarified international perceptions and eliminated the enemy's attempts at spreading rumors and sowing discord, and their schemes and machinations to oppress us spiritually. This is most gratifying. Second, besides actively participating in the meetings, many councilors have also engaged in practical work for resisting the war and building the nation outside the council. Whether in the war zones or in the rear, our councilors have achieved admirable results through their courageous and arduous efforts, inspiring the people nationwide to know that we not only contribute opinions, but also dare to put them into practice. In particular, many councilors have taken great pains to personally inspect military discipline in the front lines and to comfort the soldiers fighting at the front, enduring injuries but never losing spirit, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Now the war of resistance has entered its second phase, and the responsibilities of our national government and people are even greater; the responsibilities of this council are also correspondingly increased. The first phase of the war of resistance laid the foundation for victory; the task of the second phase of the war of resistance is to concentrate and unleash all our strength in the rear and even in the occupied areas, to strive for the final victory and the success of nation-building. In the first phase of the war of resistance, both spiritual and material aspects were emphasized; in the second phase, the importance of the spirit is even greater than that of material. To unleash the power of resistance, we must not only boost our spirits and concentrate our minds, but also prioritize the spirit and use material resources accordingly. We must first enhance the strong and striving spirit of the people nationwide, and then we can overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and complete the mission of resisting the war. After the war of resistance entered its second phase, the enemy has become bogged down in a military quagmire, becoming more and more desperate and at a loss day by day. Recently, the enemy has emphasized political maneuvering, fabricating facts, and sowing discord among our people, all in an attempt to subdue our spirits first, break down our morale, and then conquer our entire nation. To break this conspiracy, in addition to constantly focusing on military and material resources, we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance; we should not only mobilize all domestic material and human resources, but also mobilize the nation's spirit and will; not only ignite the nation's spirit, but also organize the already ignited spirit. By using organized spirit to unleash organized manpower and utilize organized material resources, we can then eradicate the aggressive tyranny and establish a permanent foundation for nation-building after the war. This task, this mission, is undoubtedly the most arduous and greatest in Chinese history. The Provisional National Congress resolved last year to convene the National Political Council, aiming to concentrate the nation's strength to overcome the unprecedented national crisis and gather the national will to establish a foundation for nation-building. We can say that the greatest contribution of the National Political Council to the nation lies in promoting our nationally unified spirit and enhancing our inherent national morality. The resonance of this spirit and morality reaches directly to every province and county, directly to the cultural economy, every profession, and every sector of the population, which can inspire a spirit of shared hatred and unwavering determination, and inspire the national people's confidence in the bright future of the nation. As this war of resistance enters its second phase, I believe that strengthening the spirit and concentrating the spirit, using our words and actions to lead a national spiritual mobilization, should be the central focus of this session.</p>
<p>To concentrate the spirit of the people, we must enable the people nationwide to establish a common moral standard for themselves and to firmly believe in a common belief in the nation. And every member can strive, struggle, and sacrifice based on this common moral concept and common national belief. What is this common morality? It is "sacrificing the individual for the greater good." What is our common belief? It is the Three Principles of the People. What is the goal we are trying to achieve based on this belief? It is our Chinese political ideal, the world of Great Harmony. The Book of Rites says:</p>
<p>"When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. The virtuous and capable are selected, and sincerity is cultivated, and harmony is promoted. Therefore, people do not only care for their own parents, nor do they only cherish their own children. The elderly are provided for, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widows, orphans, the disabled, and the sick are all cared for. Men have their proper roles, and women have their homes. People detest wasting resources, but do not necessarily hoard them for themselves... They detest not using their strength, but only for their own benefit. Therefore, conspiracies are suppressed and do not arise, and thieves and rebels do not appear."</p>
<p>This is our goal for nation-building. Only when we achieve this goal can the people nationwide enjoy true happiness, and only then can the Three Principles of the People be truly realized. Gentlemen, today we are fighting the war, shedding blood and sweat, and at the same time, we are exhausting our ingenuity to build the nation. The new nation that our leader Sun Yat-sen wanted to build is to achieve the Great Harmony described in the Book of Rites. The three points mentioned in the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session (1) Sincerity and purity, strengthening unity; (2) Contributing abilities and free lives to the nation's active struggle; (3) Concentrating all time and energy to carry out psychological construction, political construction, and economic construction - this is of course for the war of resistance, but also for nation-building. What we focus on is not only the present, but also the distant future. Since our Chinese ideal for nation-building is "everyone not being selfish with their strength, not being selfish with themselves, working hard together, and living in peace and happiness," our starting point must be sincerity and purity, being on the same wavelength, sharing interests, and truly achieving the world as one community. Our efforts must be proactive, not passive. At the same time, to increase our strength, we must accelerate the implementation of all construction related to nation-building. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session not only hopes that all party members will do so, but especially hopes that all compatriots, especially national social leaders, will unanimously accept and implement it. All of you councilors are social leaders with knowledge and experience. On the one hand, the government is using the sincerity of "selecting the virtuous and capable" to concentrate national talent to jointly shoulder the responsibility of the nation. At the same time, it hopes to use the four words "cultivate sincerity and harmony" as the basis for uniting national strength. Therefore, what we sincerely hope from all councilors is that we first establish mutual trust and shared faith, be open and honest with each other, and treat each other with harmony and kinship, as if we were brothers. There is nothing that cannot be said directly, and there is no time when we cannot understand each other. On the one hand, we want you to gather public opinion as much as possible, truly represent public opinion, and fully express public opinion, knowing everything and saying everything, so that the government and society can fully understand each other, be in harmony, and have no stagnation. On the other hand, we hope that you will use your broad and compassionate minds to implement what our ancestors called "not only caring for their own parents, not only cherishing their own children," integrating the interests of one person, one family, one village, and one locality into the interests of the whole nation and the entire nation. We must extend the heart of loving our own family to respecting the elderly, caring for the poor, and helping our suffering compatriots, solving the national crisis. We must extend the heart of loving our own children to caring for the youth of the whole country, protecting the youth of the country, giving them good role models, and guiding them to the path of sincerity, purity, and common struggle for the country, to consolidate the long-term life of our nation. If our councilors can lead the nation with this spirit, I dare say, "The war of resistance will surely be victorious, the nation-building will surely be successful, and the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the world of Great Harmony, will surely be realized."</p>
<p>To specifically explain my personal hopes, I will not hesitate to reiterate two points of view: I believe that after these two points are fully achieved, the contribution of our National Political Council to the current war of resistance and nation-building will be even greater; our spirit of jointly overcoming national difficulties will be even more prominent and bright, and the spirit of our national sages, capable people, and leaders will be uplifted. By opening up the will of the government and the people, and concentrating the strength of the government and the people, this kind of effect is more than ten times greater than improving the spirit of officers and soldiers on the front lines to dare to sacrifice. What are the two hopes I am talking about?</p>
<p>First, this session must fully demonstrate an active spirit. The emergence of our National Political Council is different from the parliament of a normal country. Our organizational spirit, the environment in which we were established, and the process we went through are all unprecedented in the political history of the world. And the achievements of our past two sessions, which have tried our best to avoid the accumulated habits of ordinary parliaments, are even more something we can be proud of in the world. Now the work of resisting the war and building the nation is even more urgent. In order to save time and increase efficiency, I believe that we must further reduce unimportant proposals as much as possible and devote ourselves more to active, constructive, and practical suggestions and discussions. I remember that in the last session, we discussed the draft review method for a long time, wasting precious time during the war of resistance. Today, you must all understand very well that our government is a revolutionary government, a responsible government, and a government that fully relies on public opinion and justice. As long as it does not violate the interests of resisting the war and building the nation, the government has no reason to restrict the rights of the people. Therefore, our councilors do not need to think too much about personal convenience and freedom, which may lead to neglecting the overall interests of the country. Today, we must maximize our proactivity and avoid the passivity that we have been deeply influenced by for thousands of years. Our past national characteristics, such as suspicion, friction, prevention, and confrontation, are all biased towards passivity, which not only cannot promote all undertakings, but also consumes a lot of useful energy, hinders a lot of progress, and even delays national affairs. We only see the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties, which was not due to the helplessness of the military, nor was it absolutely devoid of sages among our people, but simply because everyone cherished their own opinions, established their own factions, was selfish, and had different opinions, which made it impossible to unify the spirit and thus dispersed the will and strength. Looking at the partial interests, it was higher than the national interests. For personal freedom, the freedom of the country was sacrificed, so in the end, it caused the "discussion to be unfinished</p>

<h3>Under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang, the National Political Council Successfully Opened; Resolutions Submitted to the Government for Adoption; National Defense Committee Works Intensely</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, Our Newspaper, 22nd] After the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, it actively discussed the overall plans for resisting the war and building the nation, as well as the affairs of the Party, government, and military, and distributed them to the relevant parties for implementation. Currently, all our work in the front and rear is extremely intense, and the hope for the future of the country is extremely high. It is reported that the resolutions passed by the National Political Council have also been submitted to the National Defense Council for reference and adoption. At the moment, the formations of each battlefield are becoming more solid, and the training and replenishment of the troops are being carried out diligently according to the established plan. The military future is very optimistic.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Second Session of the National Political Council was held on the 12th. A total of nine general assemblies were held, and more than eighty resolutions were passed. The process was good, and the results were very satisfactory. The closing ceremony was held at 10:00 am on the 21st after the ninth meeting. The presidents of the two houses, Mr. Ju and Mr. Yu, the vice president, Zhang Qun, etc., Central Committee members Ye Chu-cang and Wu Tie-cheng, etc., and councilors Zhong Rongguang, Hu Wotan, etc., totaled one hundred thirty-eight people. Chairman Chiang led the ceremony as usual, and then delivered a closing speech. After the speech, the audience applauded enthusiastically. Then Vice Chairman Zhang and Councilor Representative Zhang Lin gave speeches, which were welcomed with applause. The meeting then adjourned. The proceedings were solemn and important. The closing speech of Chairman Chiang is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Closing Speech by Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Vice Chairman Zhang, fellow councilors: The third session of the National Political Council is held at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. Both at home and abroad, people are paying close attention to the progress of our meeting. In the past few days, we have all discussed the major plans for the nation with an active spirit. I was fortunate to have my sincere expectations for this session accepted by everyone. The spirit of unity and harmony in this session can only be described by the idioms "gathering together" and "harmonious and respectful." Seeing this scene, I have even more confidence in the future of our nation and the victory of the war of resistance. I am truly gratified.</p>
<p>Although the General Assembly is Closed, Work Never Stops</p>
<p>During this meeting, on the one hand, the government and the responsible authorities of the ministries were able to frankly and fully report on the government's situation and gained our trust. At the same time, we were able to pay attention to the practical needs of the second phase of the war of resistance for all resolutions and suggestions, and concentrate on a few specific and constructive key points. The number of proposals is not large, but the content is very substantial. In particular, many colleagues, based on their experience in participating in the war of resistance, contributed many experiences they had gained, and put forward many practical opinions, which can benefit the implementation of the government. There is such good communication between our government and this council, sharing weal and woe, and I am confident that we will be able to shoulder the responsibility of resisting the war and building the nation, and fulfill our mission of resisting the war and building the nation.</p>
<p>Now the Third General Assembly has closed. Although the General Assembly is closed, the work of our colleagues to serve the country will not stop for a day. I believe that as long as this council can continue to promote this active spirit of mutual assistance, openly and honestly assist the government, and do what we do in a down-to-earth manner, not only will the government be able to obtain a lot of help, but it will also be able to make the people of the whole country accept this kind of emotion.</p>
<p>Unite and strive together to strengthen our power to defeat the enemy, and to establish the foundation for nation-building after the war.</p>
<p>Historical Mission of the Council: Establishing a Democratic Politics</p>
<p>In the history of China's political system, this council will certainly occupy a very important and glorious position. The historical mission of this council is to enrich the foundation of the Three People's Principles, especially to establish a permanent and true democratic political foundation. I already mentioned this point in my opening speech. The ultimate goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of the Three People's Principles, in particular the Principle of Democracy, is a democratic politics. If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, then they cannot create a strong country. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on public opinion, and must be based on the interests of the people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of democracy is to create a country that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. There is no difference between ancient and modern times, and between China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>Success in the War of Resistance and Nation-Building Depends on National Mobilization</p>
<p>We are now resisting the war and building the nation at the same time. To achieve victory in the war of resistance and success in nation-building, we must never rely solely on military force, but must mobilize the spirit of the people, organize the spirit of the people that has already been mobilized, and use the sum of the national spiritual will and strength as the backing of the soldiers on the front lines, and as the driving force for the development of the rear. Therefore, in addition to enriching military strength, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the people, and it is even more necessary to conform to public opinion. The reason why the Provisional National Congress resolved to convene the National Political Council last year was that on the one hand, it hoped that the true public opinion of the country could be specifically expressed by our councilors, so that the government could understand the suffering of the people and know the hopes of the people, as a basis for implementing policies. At the same time, it also hoped that our councilors could use their status and prestige to participate in the major plans for resisting the war and building the nation on behalf of the people, and actively contribute our talents and experience to assist the government and guide the people. Then, every move of the government can be in line with the hearts of the people; every word and deed of the people can assist the government. The success or failure of the government is the success or failure of the people. The government and the people work together to cooperate. The war of resistance has the strength, and the wishes for comfort become effective. From the process of the formation of this council, we can know that whether China can defeat the enemy and achieve national independence and freedom is, of course, the responsibility of the colleagues of this council. In this aspect, whether China can be in this difficult time of the war of resistance. Creating a true democratic government model for the country and laying the foundation for long-term stability is even more the responsibility of our councilors.</p>

<h3>Using Terrorist Incidents as an Excuse, the Enemy Makes Demands on the Shanghai Concessions; Joint Conference of the Enemy's Navy and Army in Shanghai; Advisor to the Enemy's Embassy Flies to Tokyo for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The "Hochi Shimbun" claimed today that the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Army held a meeting last night, instructing the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to demand that the concession authorities immediately arrest the murderers who assassinated Chen Lu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Puppet Restoration Government. The newspaper also said, "The Japanese authorities in Shanghai will also arrest other terrorists and take necessary steps to prevent future terrorist incidents from happening. If terrorist incidents continue to occur and the terrorists are still not arrested, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai will notify the concession authorities that the Japanese government believes that the concession authorities cannot maintain order, and Japan will take appropriate steps within the concessions to maintain order, and if necessary, will even use force to defend itself."</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Shanghai, 22nd] According to a message from the Japanese news agency Domei, Japanese naval and army officers and diplomats in Shanghai gathered at the Izumo warship yesterday afternoon to discuss the overall situation in Shanghai in detail. After three hours of consultation, they agreed to adopt a "tough stance" and "effective methods to deal with any emergency," and claimed that "in order to maintain the safety and order of the concessions, they will do their best to eliminate anti-Japanese elements."</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] A Japanese spokesman said that the heads of the Japanese army and navy and the consuls visited Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, and the commanders of the British and French garrisons today to make demands, but the content was not announced.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] After the news that the Japanese side will make tough demands due to the continuous occurrence of terrorist incidents, US Navy Commander MacLeans has ordered the suspension of routine exercises to prevent any emergencies.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 20th] Mr. Mori Shigeru, an advisor to the Japanese Embassy, flew to Tokyo by plane this morning to ask the government for instructions on how to deal with the overall situation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Searching Western Shanghai; Puppet Police Shot</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] This morning, more than 800 British, Italian, and Japanese troops and inspectors from the Public Works Department conducted a strict search for terrorists in areas adjacent to the Japanese-occupied areas, but found nothing.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 20th] A joint search team of public concession inspectors and puppet Dadao police officers searched the Nissho Gongda cotton mill today and arrested five suspected terrorists. The two sides exchanged fire, and one Dadao puppet policeman and one Chinese inspector were wounded. All five terrorists escaped.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's House of Representatives; Emergency Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Foreign Dispatch from Tokyo, 22nd] Due to the proposal of an emergency interrogation regarding the Shanghai terrorist incidents, the House of Representatives meeting on the 21st was extremely tense before the meeting. All cabinet members from Hiranuma onwards, as well as all members of the Seiyukai and other parties, attended. The visitors' seats were also full. After the meeting was opened at 1:02 pm, the agenda was changed. First, Mr. Koyama Tani (Minseito) raised an emergency question regarding the maintenance of security in Shanghai. Prime Minister Hiranuma promised a fundamental solution. Then, Foreign Minister Arita explained in detail the negotiations with the Public Works Department. It is not easy to increase the number of Japanese police officers in the concessions. Although negotiations are still underway, local officials have been instructed to take appropriate measures. In any case, it seems that it is necessary to fundamentally reconsider the methods of maintaining security in the concessions due to the continuous occurrence of terrorist incidents. Regarding the activation of the right of self-defense, I am confident that it will not be obstructed by any party. Next, Navy Minister Yonai answered the questions, and Army Minister Itagaki also said, "Although the concession authorities have made various excuses for the terrorist incidents, in my opinion, it is not so much that they lack the ability to maintain security, but rather that they lack the sincerity to maintain security. If the concession authorities do not think of improving the current situation, and this continues in the long run, we will have to consider appropriate and effective measures for self-defense." After the major officials expressed the Empire's "resolute determination" and direction, the emergency interrogation was concluded.</p>

<h3>Two Hopes for the Political Participation Council – Continued from the Second Edition</h3>
<p>, the tragic scene of "the enemy has crossed the river." Today, we must set a good example for all the people of the country and for future generations. We must replace negativity with positivity, destructive criticism with constructive proposals, and suspicion and rejection with mutual assistance and unity. Therefore, the work of this session should focus on suggesting practical plans and methods for the later stages of the war of resistance, and should especially promote the spirit of loyalty to the country and joint resistance against foreign aggression. All discussions and suggestions should be infused with a positive spirit.</p>
<p>Second, this session of the conference must fully promote the spirit of sincerity, purity, mutual trust, and shared belief. The country has reached such a state, and we sit idly by without saving it. Who will save it if we don't? The interests of the nation, if we do not love and support them, who will? We must integrate the individual and the nation into one. The strength of the individual must become the strength of the nation, and the will of the individual must submit to the will of the nation. Only when the nation gains freedom can the individual truly enjoy freedom. We must all put the interests of the nation first, and extend this to others, believing that the citizens of the Republic of China all have a patriotic conscience. With shared belief, there will be mutual trust. How can we achieve sincerity and purity? Sacrificing for the sake of the nation is sincerity; having no other distractions besides the nation is purity. We would not hesitate to die for the nation, let alone other things; we all stand united in the interests of the nation, officials should propagate for the nation, actions should be for the nation, and even thoughts should be for the nation. We must make sincere efforts, but we must strive purely for the sake of the nation, towards people and towards things. We must absolutely trust each other, and then we can generate a common force to deal with the common enemy, and accomplish our common aspirations. Responsible personnel in the government now would not work so hard and endure so much hardship if it were not for the future of the nation. You would not be working so hard to share the national crisis if it were not for the future of the nation. Therefore, the government and our Political Participation Council have a consistent understanding and a consistent goal. We have a shared belief in the future of the nation, and we have mutual trust in each other. This can break down all barriers, eliminate all prejudices, and achieve sincerity, seeking truth from facts, working together in harmony, and helping each other in times of crisis. As long as we rely on this spirit, any difficulty can be overcome, and anything can be achieved.</p>
<p>The two points I have contributed above are very ordinary, but the hopes are very sincere. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, I, Zhongzheng, have shouldered a heavy responsibility, and my spirit and determination have been connected with all my colleagues. Now that I have assumed the position of Chairman of this Council, I will have more opportunities to interact with you all, and we can further work together with one heart and one mind, and learn from each other. I feel inspired and honored to be jointly responsible with you in this great mission of resisting the enemy and building the nation. I only worry about my own foolishness and clumsiness, and fear that I will not be able to live up to the expectations of my colleagues. In the future, if I, Zhongzheng, have any shortcomings, or any errors or mistakes, or if my words and deeds are inconsistent, or if I am not sincere or truthful, and cannot fulfill my duties, I hope that you will not hesitate to teach me and correct me at any time, so as not to fail in my duties. I, Zhongzheng, only have this piece of foolish loyalty and sincere devotion to the nation, and I am willing to share difficulties and honors with everyone, with one heart and one mind, from beginning to end, to fulfill our mission of resisting the enemy and building the nation, and to meet the expectations of the government and the people of the whole country.</p>

<h3>A General by Dongting Lake</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Taking the Yuehan Railway northeastward from Zhuzhou, the weather was still warm during the day, but it became surprisingly cold at night, so cold that it was impossible to doze off for even a moment. But when I thought of the soldiers at the front, who, regardless of day or night, rain or snow, cold or hunger, had to lie in the trenches and fight bitterly, a fire seemed to start in my heart, burning so that my whole body became warm and sweat flowed down my back.</p>
<p>Changsha, the city of fire, is almost a month ago now, but the people in the car are still chattering about it endlessly, perhaps as a reflection of the great trauma and pain. After a while, the car arrived in Changsha. To go north, we had to change cars again. The weather was surprisingly cold at night. In not much time, the military tents, stones, rooftops, and distant broken walls, ruins, plains, etc. at Changsha Station were all covered with a layer of crystal-clear, shimmering white snow.</p>
<p>From some broken walls and ruins, a few flashes of fire occasionally appeared, dimly lit. We knew that it must be people awakened by the cold snow and the piercing wind, taking their remaining beams and rafters or pulling out the rice straw they were curled up on and burning a fire to keep warm. In addition, from the wreckage of that vast sea of fire, gusts of smoke and stench were blown by the cold wind, quietly and unconsciously entering my nostrils. It was best to ignore it and let it pass. If you were to evaluate the taste and trace the cause, it would definitely make you feel extremely sad.</p>
<p>The train hoped to arrive in Miluo early tomorrow morning. It had already eaten its fill of coal and drank its fill of water. After the passengers had roughly mourned the disaster area of Changsha in the snowy night, as if it wanted to identify the culprit, it immediately shouted loudly a few times and pulled us towards the * direction.</p>
<p>The train arrived at its destination on time. After getting off the train, I inquired at the ×× Department Liaison Station about the troops and the route I was going to find. Only then did I learn that General Luo Zhuoying, the first person I wanted to find, had unfortunately gone to ×× place that day. At that time, it gave me an idea: "He went to ×× place. The rumor in Changsha that he will concurrently serve as the Chairman of ×× Province is probably only a matter of time, right?" Secondly, not far from here in ×× place, General Guan ××min, commander of the ×× Army Group, was still stationed there. I had interviewed Guan when he was fighting at Gubeikou of the Great Wall in the past. Now I will meet him again on the battlefield, which really makes me very excited!</p>
<p>I called him first, and he agreed to send an adjutant to lead the way. The ditches were crisscrossed, the fields were fertile, and the wheat leaves and bean flowers were green and white. The adjutant said casually that he had only returned from the front line of * qiang River three days ago. The battle there was still raging. The * people first oppressed us across the Henan, but we also pushed dozens of miles north, and took the points they were stubbornly holding one by one. Their troops are weak, and their fighting spirit is lost. They only know how to lurk in bunkers and fire guns and cannons indiscriminately, like turtles shrinking their heads, and there is no chance to find them to kill them happily. From this point of view, the battle situation in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has obviously become a stalemate in which we have a slight advantage. That's right, when I saw Commander Guan later, he also believed that the current situation was like this.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war of resistance, Guan has repeatedly made contributions in various battles in the north and south and has endured many hardships. However, his full spirit and fat body are still the same as when we met in the past. He first answered the reporter's questions about the battle situation amicably, then stood up, pointed to the military map hanging on the wall, and started talking about the counterattack battles from Xinqiang, Matang, and other places east of Dongting Lake. How smoothly we advanced, how we regained many trophies. Then he moved his finger, drew an arc downwards to the right through Yueyang, Linxiang, Tongcheng and other places, and then pointed to Pingjiang and said, "* The army suffered a setback when it went south from the north of Yueyang, and then tried to detour around us through this route. However, we also had a strong deployment on the Pingjiang route, causing them to suffer a serious blow. Although they are now launching large-scale offensives against our northwest and southwest, their troops are insufficient and they cannot take care of everything, so the war in central China is gradually becoming silent, and we are given the opportunity to take advantage of the weakness. This is an irreparable flaw in the second phase of the * people's war of aggression, and at the same time, it is one of the many superior conditions that we must have in the first phase of the war of resistance."</p>
<p>"The bloody lessons and the iron-like results we have obtained from the third stage (battle) of the first phase (strategy) of the war of resistance are all contributing to our second phase—that is, moving towards victory from the war of resistance." He was like a great orator standing on the podium. Once the topic was announced, he won thunderous applause, and he talked endlessly.</p>
<p>"We must recognize what the results of the third stage of the first phase have achieved. That is, actively luring * into a wider range of comprehensive battles and longer-term protracted wars. * people suffer inevitable defeat. Specifically, the * people's strategic policy of quick battles and quick decisions was first broken by our fists, and then their attempts to carry out annihilation battles were broken one by one. Once the geographical situation is special in the future, it is even more impossible to seek annihilation battles completely. Recently, the * people have repeatedly released the atmosphere of quick peace and quick conclusion, and their inner anxiety has already been seen in their words, but they have still been refuted by our highest leader without any integrity and completely rejected. It burned the flames of war in advance, and seeing that the general situation was unfavorable, it wanted to cut off its own lifeline and induce the other party to dissolve it. Of course, it can only pretend to be fat by swelling its face and defend its face from a military point of view.</p>
<p>"It came from afar across the ocean. In the first phase of the operation, it had a hundred times more difficulties than us in terms of major advantages and various living habits. Now the war zone is even more expanded, and its difficulties will inevitably increase, forcing it to take risks and not know its own death?"</p>
<p>"As for our war affairs and tactics, there have been significant improvements. Now we are doing our best to exploit our strengths and attack the * people's weaknesses, firmly establish the belief that we will win, and promote the spirit of deep entry into the * people's camp. The people's hearts are becoming more and more energetic, the morale is becoming more and more heroic, there is no worry about replenishing soldiers, there should be no lack of military resources, and the international situation is increasingly favorable to us. These many subjective and objective conditions are all to promote our progress towards victory."</p>
<p>——In Guan's conversation, his observations on the future situation between * and us were purely based on facts and the insightful arguments of accurate analysis. Let us try to think calmly, in the first phase of the war of resistance, why were there so many traitors captured in the front and rear, like cattle hair? Why are the front-line generals who violate their duties innumerable? However, in the current second phase of the war of resistance, such heartbreaking leaks have visibly decreased, and it can even be hoped that they will continue to decrease. This is the example of "a nation's awareness of the war is becoming more and more progressive, and the soldiers are becoming more and more heroic" that Guan pointed out. Guan bravely fought in northern Hunan this time, preventing the * from advancing southward. A gentleman intends to give a poem with the line, "Do not teach * * * to pasture in the south, a general by Dongting Lake," which can truly be a portrait of Guan's brilliant achievements.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Reports: Military Expansion Will Not Be Relaxed; National Defense Work Has Been Effective; Britain and France Discuss Wartime Missions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The British House of Commons today continued the debate on national defense. Prime Minister Chamberlain said, "I have seen the strong feeling of controversy disappear. Members of the entire House have deeply understood the realistic situation and the necessity of the armament plan, as well as the method of financial management. Recalling that the Labor Party insisted on the policy of collective security and international basis last year, they now rely on the power of the League of Nations. Under the current circumstances, it is ineffective. Therefore, we are now taking other methods to maintain peace and the security of our country. The Labor Party's opinion that destroying the Union is inappropriate. Future historians will be able to understand that the sacrifices made by Britain for international efforts are greater than the sacrifices of any country. The League of Nations cannot implement the policy of sanctions, which is not Britain's fault, nor is it the fault of other countries. The real reason is that the work we have given it is beyond its ability." Referring to yesterday's speech by Finance Minister Simon, Chamberlain said, "Sir Simon said that national defense expenses can be borne separately by the country's income and borrowing, so the implementation of national defense is obviously vigorous. After a long period of effort, preparation, and organization, the national defense plan has begun to produce visible results. We all know that in the past few months, the production of various munitions and machinery has increased significantly. Our labor will soon get the rewards it deserves." Chamberlain then discussed domestic defense, saying, "Although the progress of domestic defense is slightly slow, under the guidance of Sir Anderson, various measures have been completed one after another, and soon there will be results as we hoped." Chamberlain praised Lord Chatfield extremely, saying that he is very suitable for the work of talent and defense adjustment. "Mr. Morrison was appointed as Lord Chatfield's representative in the House of Commons. This move does not mean that Morrison is a minister of the supply department. The production of munitions, especially aircraft and other aviation department items, has greatly increased, which shows the wisdom of the government not appointing a minister of supply. As for finance, I don't know if this hospital has realized the importance of the national expenditure that should be investigated here. If our military expansion plan is finally completed, then we need to take further actions, not only for our loans, we need to pay interest, but also for the increased troops, we need to have annual maintenance fees. According to the Ministry of Finance's budget, next year's military expansion expenses are expected to be allocated 230 million pounds from the national income, which is a serious phenomenon that no one can ignore. I do not intend to mention how to solve this problem. If we allow this phenomenon to continue to develop without thinking about ways to stop it, it is no different from committing a crime. Yesterday, someone gave a speech advocating convening a world military accommodation meeting. If I believe that this conference can produce effective results, I will not hesitate to convene it immediately. Unfortunately, the time is not yet ripe, and it is difficult to hold this meeting at present. I have never believed that my political enemies have the intention of carrying out war, but I believe that the policies they are pursuing may cause war. Although our military equipment is huge, this is the military equipment for national defense. If other countries are as unaggressive as our country, then our promotion of military equipment is due to mutual misunderstanding. I believe that we cannot relax on the matter of military expansion, but if all countries are willing to implement disarmament, we are also willing to follow suit. If all countries continue to expand their military, then a total collapse will be inevitable." Labor Party leader Attlee replied to this speech, accusing the Prime Minister of shameful gains, saying, "Chamberlain should have shown his enthusiasm for appeasement and disarmament seven years ago. We really need a true Minister of National Defense. Last year's events have destroyed the balance of power, and Britain has fallen from collective security to isolation. Have the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union on stabilizing the world situation already been held? The feeling in all circles is very dark, because the people believe that the Prime Minister has sacrificed the most important moral principles. This does not mean that the Prime Minister will cause war, but that the Prime Minister should advance with freedom, democracy, and the law. The general feeling is that the Prime Minister is in league with illegal aggression and totalitarianism." Churchill continued Attlee's speech, saying, "The current time is a period of bloodless war. The British people hope that this war will never be bloody, and that true peace will be achieved in the end. The current transitional period is unprecedented in British history. In order to realize the hopes of the British people, it is important that all the strength of Britain should be used as much as possible, so it is right to use British credit as a powerful weapon. Britain does not want to exaggerate, but in fact, whether it is in finance or other aspects, Britain's strength is very strong. Next year will be a year of great increase in national defense strength, and Britain's aircraft factories will produce a large number of aircraft that only Germany can achieve." Morrison, the House of Commons spokesman for Defense Adjustment Minister Lord Chatfield, replied on behalf of the government, "We are taking huge national defense steps, not because we think there is an unavoidable war. We know that the government cannot implement the principle of limited liability once a war occurs. Our resources are all related to the war. What we should be concerned about now is the preparation for the early stages of the war. The government is willing to assure the people that the British and French staff departments have begun talking about the two countries' tasks in the event of a future war. Our plan should be practical and complete, and manpower, munitions, and all military supplies should be linked to each other, and each should have an appropriate place."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] According to inquiries, the French authorities, in view of Italy's increasing troops in Libya to 65,000, are preparing for contingencies and have increased troops by 5,000 in Gibraltar, and proposed to hold a military meeting with the British to discuss the European situation. If the British agree, it is expected to be held on Saturday or Sunday. According to the Gibraltar police report, foreign spies have been found to be active everywhere recently.</p>
<h3>United States and Brazil Discuss Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The content of the economic agreement between the United States and Brazil, originally scheduled to be announced today (Wednesday), has been extended indefinitely. It is heard that difficulties have arisen in the negotiations with the other party, but the State Department and the Brazilian government both refuse to make any announcements. According to the Brazilian side, Foreign Minister Aranha has proposed the Brazilian opinion to all parties concerned and is waiting for a reply, but political circles here say that the State Department and the Ministry of Agriculture have differences over the amount of loans to Brazil, and it is expected that this matter will have to wait until President Roosevelt returns to Washington before a decision can be made. In addition, Brazil's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Souza, will arrive in New York on Saturday or Sunday, and the Brazilian chargé d'affaires in Washington will go to New York to meet him. The new ambassador also received instructions from Foreign Minister Aranha to proceed to Washington immediately after arriving in New York to consult with the US authorities on the economic agreement.</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Message to Christians Around the World</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek recently met with Dr. Tuck, Chairman of the North American Missionary Federation, and issued a message to Christians around the world, the content of which roughly stated that the material and spiritual assistance of Christians to our country's people has been obvious, and the missionaries are willing to sacrifice themselves to help those who are suffering. I believe that the struggle of our people in this suffering has made them gain a spiritual victory, laying the foundation for the victory of the war of resistance. Such facts can far prove that justice is stronger than power.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Netherlands Discussed Far East Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 22nd] The Dutch authorities replied to the members of parliament in the parliament that the exchange of opinions between the British and Dutch governments on Far East defense was only of an ordinary technical nature. The broadcast of Russian and German news to the Dutch East Indies was also heatedly discussed in parliament. According to Dutch Governor-General Yi, the government is considering prohibiting the reception of foreign news.</p>
<h3>US Warships Conduct Exercises; Japanese Fishing Boats Follow and Spy; Secret Agents Are Studying How to Deal with It</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 22nd] Federal government secret agents are now studying how to deal with the report that Japanese fishing boats have been secretly following the US fleet from Los Angeles to San Diego to the Caribbean exercise area. District Attorney Harrison announced that he had received information that a number of these fishing boats had appeared at the exercise site at the same time as the fleet. These fishing boats have never fished near that area before, and this is the first time, so it is especially worthy of attention. At the same time, it has been found that there are many Japanese fishing boats spying on the fleet's activities with telescopes.</p>
<h3>Spanish President, Rumors of Fatigue, Spanish Embassy in France Denies</h3>
<p>[Halian Press, Paris, 22nd] Recently, rumors have been spreading that President Azaña is tired of his duties. The Spanish embassy here denies this, saying, according to Martín, that news of the Spanish president's resignation will soon be announced within 48 hours. France's recognition of the Franco government will become easy. Spanish Prime Minister Negrín will be forced to surrender. Also, the French government, due to the large expenses required to provide food to Spanish refugees, has requested that England, the United States, and the Soviet Union share the responsibility, as there are currently 400,000 refugees residing in French territory, costing approximately 3 million francs per day. The British and American governments have already agreed to provide assistance, but there has been no response from the Soviet Union. Furthermore, according to recent reports from Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín suddenly clashed with Member of Parliament Besteiro. Besteiro is very active in parliament and has recently advocated for unconditional surrender to General Franco, and it is rumored that he will send a nationwide telegram advocating for peace. It is also rumored that many Spanish political figures are preparing to elect Communist leader José Díaz Ramos as president to succeed Azaña, but one account states that Ramos has been "missing" since the fall of Catalonia. It is also rumored that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Spain is discussing surrender with Negrín and General Miaja to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. The Spanish Embassy in Paris issued a public statement denying that any Spanish leaders have such intentions. Also, French parliamentarian Bérard has not arrived in Spain, and meetings cannot be held for discussion. Most newspapers still advocate for the prompt recognition of the Franco government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 23rd] The four countries of the Balkan Entente, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, have all agreed to legally recognize the Franco government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] The French representative to the Franco government, Mr. Bérard, carrying new government instructions, has departed for Burgos to negotiate the exchange of diplomatic representatives with the rebels. The condition for France's legal recognition of the Franco government will not be a written guarantee, but only the rebels' verbal promise to permanently pursue an independent foreign policy and not to ally with totalitarian states. At the same time, Prime Minister Daladier will hold a cabinet meeting before the end of the week to decide on simultaneously announcing legal recognition of the Franco government with England and France.</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Economic Negotiations Scheduled for Mid-March</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen, an advisor to the British Foreign Office, arrived here from London on the 20th, presumably to begin Anglo-German economic negotiations. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received him. Yesterday morning, Knatchbull-Hugessen had a long meeting with Dr. Wiehl, head of the German Foreign Office's economic department. It is reported that both sides are soliciting opinions from German industrialists and representatives of the British Industrial Federation, preparing to convene a meeting on March 25th. The German side will be represented by Dr. Poensgen, Chairman of the United Steel Works, representing the four major industries.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Knatchbull-Hugessen of the British Foreign Office will remain in Berlin until Friday or Saturday. It is reported that in addition to meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, he may also visit German Economics Minister Funk and General Göring, and hold talks with representatives of major industries, German banks, and private banks. At that time, German banks will host a luncheon in his honor.</p>
<h3>Siamese Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] According to the "Manchester Guardian's" Singapore correspondent, "People returning from Bangkok say that the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas, received a warm welcome during his visit to Siam, which is a manifestation of the friendly relations between Britain and Siam. In the past few years, Japan has made every effort to cultivate friendly relations with Siam. There have been no fewer than six or seven Japanese goodwill missions to Siam." Regarding Japan's desire to build a canal in Siam, the correspondent believes that it is practically impossible because the cost is enormous and far beyond Japan's capacity. The correspondent added that Siam's foreign policy is precisely to maintain an equal balance of power between England and France, and the power of Japan.</p>
<h3>New British Battleship, HMS King George V Launched, The King and Queen Attend in Person</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The new British battleship "King George V" was launched this afternoon at the Walker Naval Yard here. The King and Queen attended in person. According to the Admiralty, the ship is 35,000 tons and will be the fastest in the British fleet, equipped with ten 14-inch guns and sixteen 5.25-inch guns. The ship also carries aircraft, and a crew and officers of approximately 1,500, and will serve as a flagship. The King was very pleased during the event and expressed satisfaction with the ship.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] According to the "Daily Mail's" naval correspondent, contracts for the two battleships, "Lion" and "Temeraire," from the British 1938 naval program, have now been approved. Both ships are 40,000 tons and carry multiple 16-inch guns.</p>
<h3>Japan Experiencing a Severe Shortage of Military Supplies, Parliament Issues an Order Prohibiting Statistics, and Forbids the Publication of Meteorological Information</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 22nd] According to a report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the Japanese Diet has recently issued the strictest prohibitions, forbidding the following statistics and information: 1. Prohibition of statistics on the transportation of military supplies to the Three Eastern Provinces and mandated territories; 2. Prohibition of statistics on the manufacture of military weapons; 3. Prohibition of statistics on the manufacture of military supplies; 4. Prohibition of disseminating statistics on military supply stockpiles; 5. Prohibition of statistics on the import of military supplies; 6. Prohibition of statistics on the number of military transports; 7. Prohibition of statistics on the tonnage of military transports; 8. Prohibition of statistics on military transport equipment; 9. Prohibition of compiling statistics on behalf of army and navy personnel; 10. Prohibition of meteorological information. From the above series of prohibitions, we can draw the following conclusions: 1. Japan's stockpile of military weapons and supplies is about to be exhausted; 2. The import of Japanese military weapons and supplies has sharply decreased; 3. The production of military weapons and supplies is dwindling; 4. Transport infrastructure is in disarray. In other words, Japan's predicament can be imagined.</p>
<h3>British Aid to China Fund Continues Fundraising, Swedish Doctor Hultman Will Come to China to Assist in Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] The British Aid to China Fund continues to collect donations from all walks of life to be remitted to China for the construction of an International Peace Hospital. The daily amount donated averages £400, with an additional special donation of over £1,000 received from abroad.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Stockholm, 21st] The Aid to China Committee has dispatched Dr. Hultman to China to assist the International Red Cross in relief efforts. Dr. Hultman is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on the 25th of this month, and then proceed to China. He is carrying medical equipment worth 10,000 kronor (Swedish currency). The Swedish Parliament donated 128,500 kronor last year for Chinese refugee relief.</p>
<h3>Inflation Occurring in Japanese Currency</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Japan is currently implementing a thrift campaign, and the people are being forced to cut back on food and clothing to cope with the current difficulties. The phenomenon of inflation has gradually occurred, but the extent is not yet deep. The price of charcoal has more than doubled, the price of rice has increased by 10%, and the price of fish has also increased by 7%.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prepares to Order New Ships from the United States, Poland Also Negotiates to Purchase Aircraft, American Legislators All Express Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] According to a report from Moscow, Soviet Deputy Naval Commissar Rear Admiral Isakov, along with several naval technicians, will come to the United States in the near future to investigate the possibility of the Soviet Union ordering two capital ships from American shipyards. Also, the Dutch government has sent an air force delegation to the United States to negotiate the purchase of aircraft. Members of Congress have all expressed their approval.</p>
<h3>American President Actively Assists Democratic Countries, Strives to Save World Peace, Prevents Terrorist Control by Authoritarian Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] People here have recently had differing opinions regarding American foreign policy. Isolationists and Republicans believe that the United States does not need to be involved in European disputes, so it should not comment on the policies of European countries. The President and those who support his new policies advocate actively assisting democratic countries. Both sides still express agreement with Chamberlain's policies, but those who support the President's policies further believe that if Chamberlain can have strength as a backing, the results will be better. They acknowledge that the world does need peace, but peace under terrorist control risks submerging Western democratic countries in the totalitarian misery of Europe, which is far from what America wants. They point out that President Roosevelt is working to save this kind of peace. Although Roosevelt's policies are currently met with both praise and criticism, the President's constitutional powers are extremely broad, and the opposing forces are far inferior to them.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Still Adopt a Compromise Approach, Mediate the Arab-Jewish Dispute</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] According to sources familiar with Jewish affairs, the meeting between British and Jewish representatives ended yesterday, but not all negotiations have come to a standstill. It is said that the British government has obtained all the opinions of the Jewish representatives, and there is no need for further discussions for now, pending careful consideration by the British government. At the same time, the British government's talks with the Arab representatives have also come to an end. The government intends to adopt a compromise approach for mediation after consideration. If that is not possible, the British government will handle it.</p>
<h3>Fishery Treaty Issue, Soviet Union Does Not Pay Attention, Only a Chargé d'Affaires and a Secretary are Sent to Deal with It</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Soviet government has recalled Mr. Kimen-Babaev, the Second Secretary of its embassy in Japan. Therefore, the Soviet embassy in Japan currently only has Chargé d'Affaires Smirnov and another Second Secretary, Mr. Arutunov, to deal with the fishery treaty negotiations.</p>
<h3>College of Cardinals Meeting to be Held on the First of Next Month</h3>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>What After the Spring Festival?</h3>
<p>The Spring Festival is the Lunar New Year. This newspaper has been away from its readers for seven days. Seeing you all again today, I feel that there are many things to say.</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year in Hong Kong, firecrackers filled the sky, music resounded throughout the city, and theaters, pavilions, and taverns were all packed. It was truly a scene of peace and prosperity, beyond description. But let's reflect for a moment! Have we forgotten that our motherland is being ruthlessly ravaged and bombed by the enemy? Have we forgotten that our homeland, our elders, brothers, and sisters, are struggling and fighting under the enemy's iron hooves and artillery fire? Have we forgotten that the fate of our entire nation and ourselves has not yet escaped the crisis of utter destruction!</p>
<p>We have heard and seen the licentious and shameless behavior of a small number of compatriots during the Lunar New Year. Of course, we feel boundless shame and indignation, but we should also see the positive work of the many overseas Chinese and many patriotic youth groups during the Lunar New Year, such as the children's Lai See campaign, the National Products Exhibition, the Chinese Merchants' National Assembly's Lunar New Year Bazaar campaign, and even the Chaozhou Merchants Association posting "No New Year Visits During National Crisis" covenants at the doors of various businesses. All of these can allow us to see purity and light from the tainted darkness, to see the spirit of the Chinese nation and its bright future, and thus feel boundless excitement and anticipation.</p>
<p>What after the Spring Festival? We hope that everyone will carry out self-criticism and collective criticism, reviewing the past and planning for the future. We must do our utmost to curb the licentious and shameless behavior, and we must do our utmost to encourage and develop the glorious competition of patriotic salvation movements. We must concentrate all our efforts to fight for the independence of our motherland, for the liberation of the people, and for the happiness of the masses!</p>
<p>The compatriots of our motherland, from government authorities to the general public, are all fighting and moving forward in extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances in the war-torn areas. Both the front lines and the rear are urgently calling for assistance. We hope that everyone will quickly become serious, become vigilant, take on their respective responsibilities, and live up to the expectations of the motherland and the expectations of people of peace and justice around the world.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Shenzhen Wildly</h3>
<p>On the 21st, which was the third day of the Lunar New Year, Japanese planes in formation wildly bombed Shenzhen Luohu, causing an unprecedented tragedy on the Sino-British border.</p>
<p>This time, the Japanese planes took advantage of the Lunar New Year to wildly bomb the Sino-British border, turning the entire market town of Shenzhen into ruins and slaughtering hundreds of refugees. What does this tragedy tell us?</p>
<p>First, this action by the Japanese enemy exposes their true colors of massacring the Chinese people and murdering the Guangdong compatriots. It exposes that the recent propaganda by enemy traitors and pro-Japanese, anti-Communist advocates of peace, such as "the Japanese army is implementing Sino-Japanese friendship" and "the situation in Guangzhou is peaceful and happy," are completely shameless lies and completely malicious plots. The true content of the Japanese enemy's appeasement policy has already been exposed. The Guangdong compatriots will not only not be deceived, but they will certainly not surrender under the Japanese enemy's .</p>
<p>Second, this action by the Japanese enemy, together with the dispatch of heavy troops to Hainan Island last week, has the same meaning. Moreover, this attempt is intertwined with the French policy of continuing to concede to Italy and Germany on the Spanish issue. Now, the British government has protested the bombing of the British boundary by the enemy planes, but this protest requires the support of strength, one being the progress of the global movement to aid China and jointly boycott Japan, and the other being our country's persistence in united resistance.</p>
<h3>Guam Base Construction Case, Fierce Debate in the US House of Representatives, Vinson Demands Passage of the Budget, To Answer Dictators in the Same Way</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The House of Representatives yesterday fiercely debated the Guam naval aviation base construction case. Chairman Vinson of the House Naval Committee demanded the passage of the US$54 million budget for the construction of the naval and air force base and delivered a speech, saying, "It is time for the United States to answer dictators in the same way. If the United States builds a naval base in Guam, the world will know that the United States is not like other unprepared countries that await death all day long." Representative Fish vigorously opposed the fortification of Guam, saying that this plan undoubtedly places "a thorn in Japan's throat."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 22nd] During yesterday's Tuesday session of the House of Representatives, the issue of fortifying Guam in the central Pacific was once again intensely debated. A representative, speaking on behalf of the White House, explained that the plan to fortify Guam is not to be used as a current fortress. This construction is actually needed to cope with the more severe situation in the Far East in the future.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Observers here believe that the intense attacks on President Roosevelt by the Italian and German newspapers are actually intended to portray Chamberlain as a man of peace and falsely accuse Roosevelt as a warmonger.</p>
<h3>Lessons of the European Situation in 1938</h3>
<p>--Translated by Shizhang, Original by M. Osipov, Abridged from the January Issue of Moscow News</p>
<p>In the spring of 1938, Germany, using the threat of violent force, seized Austria, turning a country that had been independent for seven hundred years into a colony that had lost its independence. In the autumn of the same year, we saw the partition of Czechoslovakia. A country that had strived for independence for over a thousand years was now at the mercy of Germany. Although Chamberlain announced after returning from Munich that he had "obtained peace for our time," what we saw as "peace" was: the frantic expansion of armaments by various countries, the harsh criticism of Britain by Fascist leaders, the deterioration of Franco-Italian relations, Italy's demands for Tunisia, Corsica, Gibraltar, Nice, etc., German troops concentrated on the Polish border, and preparations to completely occupy Danzig and Memel. After Munich, Britain and France continued to adopt a policy of retreat and compromise with Fascist countries. The Franco-German Declaration of December 6 of last year is a clear proof of this. Italy's challenging tone towards France is a great humiliation for France. This is a direct result of the policy of compromise. The aggressors have dealt France a blow, causing France to lose the dignity it should have as a strong nation. However, France's own actions have had an even greater impact on striking France out of the ranks of strong nations. As for Britain, it has not changed its attitude and policy. It is trying to reach an understanding with Germany on the colonial issue. However, Hitler's demand for the return of all former German colonies means that Britain and Tanganyika will lose one of Britain's biggest gains after the European War. Therefore, the colonial issue is very difficult to resolve. South African Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Jan Smuts's visit to London and Berlin was clearly a failure, although Britain had high hopes for his mission. According to a report in the French "Le Temps," Smuts made a statement after visiting Britain and Germany: "Europe is now heading towards the path of war. Although no country wants to go to war, everyone is preparing for war. If the severe international situation cannot be reversed within one or two months, there is a possibility of war breaking out in the spring of 1939."</p>
<p>This is our "peace for our time"! Aggressors are insatiable. They confine the people already under their control in military prisons and concentration camps. Due to internal unrest, the position of Fascist countries is very shaky and unstable.</p>
<p>Last September, the German people unanimously expressed their opposition to war. Impartial observers all believed that the situation in Germany at that time was like an unofficial "national referendum." The masses gave a strong "veto" to the Fascist war policy. The German government's response to this "national referendum" was the expulsion of Jews, subjecting them to all kinds of cruel treatment. Thus, Europe returned to the barbaric era and the dark ages of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The outlook for the world situation this year is very bleak. China is currently at war, and its cruelty and barbarity are unparalleled. The war in Spain is still continuing, and the war in Abyssinia has not completely ended. Weak countries in Central Europe are facing serious threats from Fascist aggression. The sound of swords rubbing against each other, the sound of machine guns firing, the sound of cannons booming, and the sound of bombs exploding are heard all over the world. Although only twenty years have passed since the end of the European War, now, another hundred million people have been plunged into the new imperialist war. Recalling what happened twenty years ago, the people of Europe were all celebrating the end of the Great War with frenzy, thinking that they could enjoy a long period of peace. Unexpectedly, twenty years later, the capitalist world will once again fall into the Second World War. Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, Germany has torn up the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno, and Italy has disturbed the balance of power in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The seeds of a new war have already been sown all over the world. In fact, this war has already begun, and it is expanding day by day, becoming a world war more barbaric than ten great wars combined!</p>
<p>The evolution of history is often repetitive. Munich has replaced Versailles. After annexing Austria and partitioning Czechoslovakia, the current Germany is gazing at the cowardly actions of Britain and France, and the defenseless small countries. Although its attempt to expand to "three-quarters of the entire Europe" has not yet succeeded, it has already released poison gas, spreading it everywhere, preparing to carry out aggression. The European situation in 1938 clearly shows that Germany is a country that threatens world peace and provokes war. However, Hitler repeatedly says that he is working for peace. Recently, the American Opinion Research Corporation conducted a test in the United States and Britain, asking the question, "Do you believe Hitler's statement that he has no ambition to seize territory in Europe?" As a result, 92 percent of the respondents answered "No." People all over the world know the serious danger that Fascists pose to humanity. True peace cannot be achieved unless the Fascist aggressors are eliminated.</p>
<p>Germany, under the pretext of "the self-determination of the German people," enslaves the weak nations of Europe. However, is the annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia for the sake of national self-determination? Similarly, Japan, under the pretext of "saving China from the shackles of the white empires," is carrying out a cruel war of aggression against China, killing civilians, seizing land, is this saving China? People with understanding are very clear about this, so the heroic Chinese people are united, supporting the war of resistance, and opposing the aggression of Japanese imperialism in order to seek national independence and freedom. The war in Spain has also entered its third year. For the sake of national independence, the Spanish people are continuing the war of resistance to the end, regardless of any sacrifice.</p>
<p>1938 has passed. The tragedies of annexing Austria and partitioning Czechoslovakia all happened that year. This is certainly the crime of the Fascist countries, but Britain and France, who are called the leaders of democratic countries, should also bear considerable responsibility. This is a precious lesson. It is hoped that democratic countries and their wise leaders will remember this lesson, eliminate the scourge of Fascism, and work together for human peace, cultural development, and world progress.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Area Was Bombed, Then the British Area Was Bombed Too! × Planes Madly Bomb Shenzhen Luohu - Details - Japan's Protest to the British Government Has Not Yet Been Answered - Japanese Military Announces It Was a Mistake and Dropped Bombs into the British Area</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 22nd) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail," "After the British government protested to Japan about the bombing of Hong Kong, Japan's attitude has not yet been ascertained. According to British cabinet ministers' observations, Japan currently has no intention of provoking disputes with British and American interests in the Far East, because Japan is deeply aware of the many difficulties in the war with China, and is also afraid that the Soviet Union may take action next spring," it is said.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd) Yesterday, Wednesday afternoon, the Japanese military announced the incident of Japanese planes dropping bombs on the British area on Tuesday morning, stating that Japanese planes bombed Shenzhen on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway in the Chinese area at 11:00 a.m., and one plane mistakenly dropped bombs on the British area. It also said that the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong has expressed regret to the British side.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong News) At 9:00 a.m. on the third day of the Lunar New Year, × planes launched another large-scale attack on Shenzhen, dropping dozens of bombs in Shenzhen Market, killing more than a hundred innocent civilians. They then ravaged the refugee camps, bombing and then strafing with machine guns, causing a terrible tragedy. Finally, they flew over the British area of Luohu and Sheung Shui, dropping six bombs, killing more than twenty people, including one Indian constable stationed in Luohu. After this incident, the border situation became tense again. When the × planes bombed Luohu, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote happened to be watching from the roof of his villa in Fanling. He witnessed × planes dropping many bombs on the British area. Also, when the × planes bombed the 24th passenger and freight train, the landing point of the bombs was only two miles from the Governor's villa, and the sound of the explosion was clearly audible. After Sir Geoffry returned to Hong Kong, he immediately reported the × army's ×× to the British court, and at noon, the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, notified the acting Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Mr. Ohta Tokifusa, to meet with him. The Governor ××××××××××××× the Japanese plane bombing of the British area. The Governor and the Japanese Consul-General had a lengthy conversation. Mr. Ohta has submitted ××××× to his superiors. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, also lodged a protest with the Japanese government yesterday. Currently, all Chinese and foreign people in Hong Kong are paying close attention to the progress of this matter. After the incident occurred, the reporter rushed to investigate, and the detailed process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>× Nine Planes Suddenly Arrived</p>
<p>The tragedy occurred at 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. At that time, nine × planes flew in from the direction of Nantou, seven of which were bombers and two were fighter planes. They flew very low. As soon as they arrived over Shenzhen, four of them bombed Shenzhen Market, while the other five ravaged the refugee camps and the radio station. That day was the third day of the Lunar New Year. Most of the merchants in the market had opened their businesses early that morning. It was also breakfast time. The × planes arrived suddenly, and all the merchants in the market were unprepared. As soon as the × planes arrived over Shenzhen Market, they immediately circled and dropped bombs. The first bomb landed on the Xinxin Dongfang Hotel in Dongmen, which was the headquarters of the political police team. The kitchen in the rear collapsed and burned after being hit. Then, the county government office was also hit. Bombs fell one after another on the streets throughout the market. The loud sounds echoed through the valleys. After the political police team leader, Que Mingguang, stationed at the Xinxin Dongfang Hotel escaped, he immediately led his team members to extinguish the burning part to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<p>Dozens of Bombs Dropped, More Than a Hundred Killed or Injured</p>
<p>Statistics show that dozens of bombs fell on the streets throughout the market, and the number of collapsed houses was difficult to count at that time. During the bombing, men, women, old, and young in the market fled in panic. The situation was extremely chaotic. Because the incident was sudden, many did not have time to escape, and more than a hundred people were killed or injured. Many of the victims were buried under the rubble. Cries and lamentations filled the air. The situation was extremely tragic. After the × planes dropped dozens of bombs, they did not fly away. When the refugees in the market were desperately fleeing, they flew low and circled, strafing with machine guns, firing dozens of rounds. Many refugees were shot and killed on the spot while fleeing. The × planes ravaged the market for half an hour before flying towards the Chinese-British border. After Shenzhen Market was plundered, the situation was very chaotic. The bodies of the dead were left on the roadside, the injured groaned and cried, and those who were not injured had already fled.</p>
<p>Five Planes Bomb Refugee Hospital</p>
<p>In addition, five × planes ravaged the Yousheng Theater and the refugee camp. They first dropped several bombs on the main hall of the Yousheng Theater, but fortunately, they did not hit. The bombs landed on the riverbank and the nearby Dongru Tea House, injuring several people. At that time, the refugees in the camp heard the loud sound of bombs and knew that the situation was urgent. They fled the camp one after another. The refugee camp supervisor, He Mengxuan, led the staff to maintain order and, seeing that the × planes were dropping bombs more and more densely and targeting the refugee camp, ordered the newly built bamboo bridge to be opened to allow the refugees to cross into the British area. All the refugees in the camp then crossed into the British area amidst the bombing and strafing by the × planes. Because of the overcrowding, several people rushed to be the first and jumped into the river to swim across into the British area. At that time, the × planes saw the refugees moving in the air and flew low over the bridge, strafing the refugee crowd with machine guns, injuring several more people on the spot.</p>
<p>Invading the British Territory and Bombing Trains</p>
<p>After these two groups of × planes attacked the refugee camp and Shenzhen Market, they gathered to bomb the radio station. They circled and dropped more than twenty bombs near the radio station, injuring customs officers and civilians. At about 9:40, ten minutes later, Japanese planes suddenly flew diagonally into the British area from over Shenzhen. Five planes flew first, and four planes followed behind, farther away. Two of the five planes flew to the area between Luohu and Sheung Shui stations. The 24th passenger and freight train happened to be approaching Bridge No. 47. Duan Zhang Pan Zhifen was on the train and quickly ordered the train to stop and the passengers to escape. The Japanese planes first dropped a bomb, which landed in the fields between the Middlesex military camp and the railway. They continued to drop a bomb, which hit the left side of the railway. Shrapnel flew, destroying the windpipe and fire bucket of the third locomotive. The steel rails on the side of the bomb crater were only slightly damaged. The Japanese planes continued to strafe the passengers who were running away with machine guns. Two people were hit near Bridge No. 48. None of the train crew members were injured. Duan Zhang Pan was knocked into the water by the force of the explosion.</p>
<p>Bombing Luohu Station, Twenty Casualties</p>
<p>The remaining Japanese planes flew to the sky above Bridge No. 49 at Luohu Station. The purpose of the bombing seemed to be the car depot inside the station. A total of four bombs were dropped, and machine guns were used to strafe. An investigation found that the bombs landed on the old British soldier posts on the side of the station, killing on the spot one Indian constable, No. 750, Suda Xing, one Dragon Customs private, Hua _, No. 8, and six Chinese, including one child. Next to the posts were parked two or three passenger cars, Nos. 7-4 and 80, which were used as accommodations for Indian constables. The glass windows of the cards had been destroyed. The station chief and residents were taking refuge in the car depot at the time, and fortunately, they were not injured, but many of the glass windows were shattered. Part of the telephone line between Luohu and Sheung Shui was severed by the explosion. The station was covered in blood for a time. As of 1:30 p.m., the bodies had not yet been cleared. Statistics showed that a total of six bombs were dropped by the Japanese in the British area, all of which were light bombs with a wide spread. Twelve people were killed and about fifteen people were injured in the British area. At that time, four planes were in the Chinese area, and they together flew and dropped two bombs near the railway bridge at the border between Luohu and Sheung Shui, intending to destroy the railway bridge, but they missed. The bombing in the British area lasted for about ten minutes before they flew towards Nantou. After the × planes left, the Hong Kong authorities received the news and immediately issued an emergency order from the Governor. The military and police were mobilized to go to the border to defend. The chief of staff also went to inspect the scene with the police chief, Henry, at noon that day. The border situation became tense again. The railway gate was still open, allowing the refugees who fled to the British area to cross.</p>
<p>Three Thousand Refugees Moved Back to Fanling</p>
<p>As for the more than three thousand refugees in the United Relief Association's unified reception center, they had completely retreated into the British area two hours after the incident. The relief team of the Relief Association and the person in charge of Huiyang Association rushed to the New Territories to take care of the situation. They discussed with Bishop Hall and Father Lai Yien, who were in charge of the Emergency Relief Association, and decided to temporarily move the refugees back to Fanling. They were accommodated in the original day-shift train carriages and persuaded by the police authorities to return to Fanling. The police have sent personnel to guard the strategic points in the New Territories to prevent the refugees from dispersing. It was not until after 1:00 a.m. that things were finally settled. The refugees spent the night in the Fanling, and some were in Sheung Shui, and they were not gradually accepted into the Fanling carriages until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ruins After the Robbery, A Scene of Desolation</p>
<p>The reporter inspected the bombed Shenzhen Market in the afternoon of that day. Bullet marks could still be seen on the ruined walls and vehicles near the Weihu Station. Blood stains of the dead remained on the ground. Crossing the Chinese border, the blood stains and bullet marks were shocking. Along the road, refugees from the market were fleeing to the British area, turning into the market. All that could be seen were collapsed walls and broken tiles. The once prosperous market town had suddenly become a field of rubble. In the market, dozens of houses were collapsed on South Qing Street, Yunsheng Street, Yazi Street, Dongxin Street, Shangda Street, and Xixing Street. Even those that were not destroyed had been deserted in nine out of ten rooms. The scene was extremely desolate. From time to time, mutilated limbs or bloody corpses were found in the disaster area, and the tragic scene was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>The British Side Lodges a Serious Protest to Japan</p>
<p>Furthermore, at 4:45 p.m. yesterday, a × plane flew to Shenzhen at a high altitude of more than 1,000 feet for reconnaissance, but did not drop any bombs, and then flew away. Also, the Hong Kong Air Force Command dispatched two planes at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday to fly over Luohu and Shenzhen, circling for as long as two hours. As for the incident of the × planes dropping bombs in the border area, killing and injuring the people. Currently, the Hong Kong authorities have stated that the British court has protested to Japan. Regarding this matter, the "Hong Kong Telegraph" published the following news: 1. The Hong Kong Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, visited the acting Japanese Consul in Hong Kong yesterday to discuss the matter of Japanese planes dropping bombs in the British area for a long time. The British Ambassador, Sir Robert Clive, has lodged a serious protest with the Tokyo authorities. 2. When the Japanese planes dropped bombs in the British area, Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote happened to be with his wife, son, and Major Beatty, and witnessed the situation clearly. The place where the Japanese planes dropped bombs was only two miles away from the villa, and the sound of the explosion was clearly audible. 3. According to the opinion of the Hong Kong Army authorities, there is currently no need to increase the garrison on the border, nor to order the defense forces to use anti-aircraft guns when necessary.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Service Corps in Vietnam Returns to the Country to Save the Nation - Expected to Arrive in Hong Kong by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The first batch of the Overseas Chinese Youth Battlefield Service Corps in Vietnam previously worked with the army in the Huizhou area and made great sacrifices. The corps returned to Vietnam at the end of last year for replenishment. Currently, the training has been completed and they will soon pass through Hong Kong to serve the country. Yesterday, the corps leader, Lu Yiang, Zhang Lupeng, etc., wrote to Mr. Du Qizhang, a gentry and businessman in Hong Kong, briefly stating that, "When our corps was previously in Hong Kong, we were honored to receive your kind treatment in everything, and we are very grateful. Now the first batch of corps members returning to Vietnam has completed replenishment training and is scheduled to return to the country for service at the beginning of the Lunar New Year and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong by the end of the month," and so on.</p>

<h3>Before and After [New Year] (I)</h3>
<p>-- Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Some People Laugh, Some People Suffer</p>
<p>"A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes." This newspaper and its readers have been apart for seven days, and it is inevitable that there will be very many exciting and exciting news that needs to be reported to the readers as quickly as possible. What I want to sketch here is the general trend "Before and After the New Year" during the suspension period:</p>
<p>The only carnival festival for the Hong Kong compatriots in the metropolis, the pulsating artery, is still the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>"New Year" in Hong Kong is like the metropolis's artery throbbing, throbbing at an accelerating pace. Throb – Throb – The characteristics of feudal and capitalist societies are nakedly exposed; the two extremes of "rich" and "poor" are also sharply opposed.</p>
<p>Transportation is the nervous system of a city; it is also frantically circling around New Year's. The "human tide" at the United Pier is surging in one batch after another. The ferries are shuttling back and forth. The last ferry on "New Year's Eve" was not until 3:00 am!</p>
<p>Trams and buses are just as crowded as ferries. Unless you can cough up a few more cents to sit on a higher grade, you can suffer less from the crowding.</p>
<p>The market for selling New Year's goods is like a disturbed hornet's nest, with everyone carrying large baskets and small baskets of various goods weaving through the crowd. Clearly, some are driving around enjoying the breeze with flowers and toys, while others are busy buying soy sauce and vinegar.</p>
<p>Market Conditions</p>
<p>The bustling situation in the flower markets in Hong Kong and Kowloon on "New Year's Eve" broke all historical records, but this was originally because a large number of refugees were joining in the fun, and the customers were as rare as morning stars. Hanging bells, peach blossoms, daffodils... all started at high prices, and until about two o'clock on New Year's Eve, they were sold cheaply because there were many viewers and few buyers. On the morning of New Year's Day, this reporter personally saw two large plum blossoms that had not been invited into tall buildings the night before, lying decadently next to a pile of chamber pots, as if sighing deeply in Pang Lane, Daan Terrace. They came from afar, and they were both lucky and unlucky!</p>
<p>The flower vendors' profits were indeed very meager, and the business of relying on transportation to the mainland was also very bleak due to the war. According to general custom, on the second day of the New Year, the boss treats the staff to a hearty drink. There must be chicken in the middle. After eating it, they announce who will stay and who will leave in the New Year. This year, due to the impact of the war, inland business was declared bankrupt, and "inevitably shrinking and dismissing employees." "Ruthless chicken" is really ruthless, but where to go after the baggage is packed? Looking at the war-torn homeland, Hong Kong has another group of bitter people.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's population has suddenly increased from 300,000 to 1.1 million. Those who sell food and daily necessities are of course making three times the profit. During the New Year, the price of food more than doubled, which is common. For example, chicken usually costs six or seven cents per catty, but it can cost as much as one dollar and two cents during the New Year. Also, because there are more high-class refugees, the number of extravagant customers has also increased. Therefore, the owners of department stores, restaurants, and dance halls are all smiling. The business of those other than these is frowning because of the war. I sincerely hope that the overseas Chinese will persevere and support the victory of the war, so that everything can be brought back to normal and developed normally, so that not some people laugh and some people suffer.</p>
<p>The World of Firecrackers</p>
<p>From "New Year's Eve" onwards, the dense sound of firecrackers constantly struck people's eardrums, and it was not until the afternoon of the second day of the Lunar New Year that it thinned out a little. Yesterday, the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, when the market reopened, it was lively again. In these days and nights of harassment, it really irritated people who could not sleep.</p>
<p>Merchants and shops said that it was for "thanking the gods" and "supporting the facade." Some are a long string of electric light firecrackers, and some are a tree of fireworks, which easily attract a group of pedestrians. As a result, the car is as clumsy as a pig and cannot move forward, and the police officers who maintain order are shouting east and west, very busy.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, either a "bang" startles you, or the paper and sparks of firecrackers unceremoniously pounce on you, as if you are drilling through a forest of guns and bullets. The fleeing compatriots cannot help but think of the taste of being under bombs and machine gun fire. That is a chilling memory. However, how many compatriots in the homeland are still living under bombing!</p>
<p>It is said that in previous years, the burning of firecrackers was even more狂熱. This year, it is considered to be slightly reduced due to the impact of the war. However, such unwarranted waste is still considered a regrettable thing by those who care!</p>
<p>General Customs of the New Year</p>
<p>The "big lanterns" under the arcade are shining, reflecting the "neon lights". There are good men and women of faith kneeling on the ground and 向 香 bowing their heads to the red paper strips of "Welcoming the God of Wealth at the Doorway Landlord" and "Protecting the God of Wealth with the Land at the Staircase". They also posted Spring Festival couplets such as "Happy New Year" and "Harmony Brings Wealth."</p>
<p>After worshiping the gods and burning firecrackers on "New Year's Eve," they have a drink in the newly decorated shops and homes with calligraphy and paintings, and then play mahjong.</p>
<p>When you get up on "New Year's Day," you bow to each other and say auspicious words when you meet. Business cards are flying, widely posting New Year's advertisements. There must be articles in exchanging gifts and visiting each other. "Lucky money" is a courtesy of reciprocity, which is the greatest hope of children and servants in a year.</p>
<p>The ways of worshiping gods and ancestors vary in complexity, and the ways of playing tricks vary. Although they live in a "progressive" city, there are still many, many unbreakable feudal customs that have been passed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p>The "New Year" of the Working Class</p>
<p>The working class, who take the building as their home and as their bed, have an even more miserable New Year. The boss is driving them away, the pedestrians are harassing them, and the firecrackers are attacking and persecuting them. People are dressed in beautiful clothes, but the clothes and appearance of the poor are still the same as usual on "New Year's Day." The poor little beggars are full of infinite hope, thinking that by stringing together a few auspicious words, a short song, and pasting red paper strips on the money-collecting milk cans or broken boxes, they can win the favor of the "rich people". Who knew that the rich people would think: "How annoying – if you give one, another one comes! Giving a copper coin passively is of no help!" Their hopes were dashed with cold water. One disappointment after another!</p>
<p>The children who shine shoes have particularly good business on New Year's Day because they can give people a little "glory." Shining a few more pairs of shoes and earning a few more copper coins is the New Year's hope for a large group of sad-faced children.</p>
<p>A group in short clothes and pants is either gambling copper coins on the dirty ground, or grouping together in groups of three or five to gamble low cards. Some also place square mahjong tables in the store or in a seat in order to play cards while doing business. Those who do work are all the same. Although they cannot be as "comfortable" as those who live in tall buildings, they enjoy themselves. They are also enjoying the "New Year" to the fullest.</p>
<p>What will happen after the "New Year"? Those who are unemployed, those who are fleeing... are still at a loss as to where to return!</p>
<h3>Five Robberies in a Week of Spring Vacation - The Submarine "Hankou" Also Visited - Two Men and Women Work Together to Resist the Thieves and Seize Their Weapons</h3>
<p>During the spring vacation, a total of five robbery cases occurred in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The details are as follows: (1) On the second floor of No. 8 Shan Village Road, Happy Valley, at 3:30 p.m. on the 15th of this month, three robbers used the pretext of delivering gifts to commit robbery. However, they were discovered by the owner, who blew the whistle to alert the police. The thieves fled in panic. Police detectives arrived at the scene to investigate and found two small knives at the stairs, which were taken back to the police station for filing. (2) On the 15th of this month, at 6:00 p.m., a man, Liu Zhigen, and his girlfriend were out for a walk when a man approached them for alms at Six Mile Stone on Tai Po Road. However, he was refused. The man then tried to draw a gun. Mr. Liu immediately resisted. At that time, Mr. Liu's girlfriend took the gun from the thief from behind. The two sides fought into a group. As a result, the bandit could not resist and fled. Mr. Liu then took the gun to the police station to report the case. (3) On the 16th of this month, at about 5:00 a.m., in a building at a certain number on Bute Street, Yau Ma Tei, three armed bandits broke into the house to commit robbery. The owner, Mrs. Zhang _, and her family were all tied up by the thieves. As a result, jewelry and silver worth more than 400 yuan were robbed. (4) On the 17th of this month, at 11:00 p.m., a man, Ye Fang, was on the submarine "Hankou" opposite Tsim Sha Tsui when six robbers boarded the ship in a sampan and robbed more than a hundred yuan in cash. (5) On the 17th of this month, a man, Pan Quan, went to the police station to report that at _ o'clock that afternoon, when he was passing through Beihe Street, Sham Shui Po, he was intercepted by three robbers, two with swords and one with a pistol, who robbed him of 95 yuan. After receiving the report, the police authorities were quite suspicious of the case and are currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Spring Holiday Supplement: Hong Kong News - National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Second Chinese Products Exhibition, organized by the Chinese Manufacturers' Union, was held at the South China Middle School in Kowloon on the 19th of this month. The exhibition lasted for four days and concluded successfully at 10 pm last night. 128 manufacturers participated, showcasing over a thousand kinds of products. Over the four days, the exhibition was extremely crowded with an estimated 200,000 visitors. According to Mr. Xie Bochang, the association's affairs director, the manufacturers participating in this exhibition were specially permitted by the association to freely sell goods, with 5% of the proceeds to be handed over to the association. After deducting expenses, all remaining funds will be used for charitable purposes. The total sales for the four days were approximately $8,000.</p>
<p>Increased Heavy Oil Tax</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities, seeking new sources of revenue, appointed a New Tax Research Committee to handle the matter. It was announced in the Gazette last Saturday, the 6th, regarding the imposition of a tax on heavy oil for land use (commonly known as kerosene). The Attorney General will present it for discussion at the upcoming Legislative Council meeting. If there are no objections, it will be passed and implemented. Once implemented, each gallon of heavy oil will be taxed at 30 cents, equivalent to the tax on light gasoline used in ordinary motors. With the implementation of this tax, the Hong Kong government's monthly tax revenue is expected to increase by approximately $20,000, amounting to about $240,000 to $250,000 annually.</p>
<p>Serious Truck Accident</p>
<p>At around 3 pm on February 20th (the second day of the Lunar New Year), a truck accident occurred near Wuhu Street, Hung Hom, resulting in one death and three injuries. The truck involved was vehicle number 519 of the Luen Tai Transportation Company. On that day, Chen Huo, an employee of the company, his wife Fang Huiqing, and their daughter Chen Weiqiang (4 years old) were visiting relatives in Hung Hom. They, along with Chen Hai and Su Sheng, were riding on the truck. At around 3 pm, while driving near Wuhu Street in Hung Hom, the truck suddenly crashed into the nearby hillside, causing it to overturn. Chen Huo's wife and daughter, who were sitting in the back of the truck, were thrown out onto the ground about ten feet away, sustaining injuries all over their bodies. Chen Hai was unharmed. After the accident, Chen Hai fled the scene. The girl, Chen Weiqiang, died in the hospital shortly after admission due to severe injuries.</p>
<p>Factory Fire</p>
<p>The Sun Cheung Automobile Body Manufacturing Factory near Kowloon Hospital on Argyle Street, Mong Kok, caught fire at 6:30 pm on the 18th of this month (Lunar New Year's Eve). Because the factory's building materials, such as bamboo, wood, and palm, were all flammable, once ignited, the fire spread rapidly. It took over an hour to extinguish the fire, by which time the entire factory had been reduced to ashes. Several Studebaker trucks inside the factory were also partially burned, with losses estimated at around $80,000.</p>
<p>Xu Jian Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xu Jian, a clerk at the Hong Kong office of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, was accused of embezzlement by stealing official letters. Barrister Wen Jin represented the Ministry of Finance in the prosecution, while lawyer Xi Bingxi represented the defendant. After multiple interrogations by the judge, the defendant completed his testimony yesterday afternoon. After arguments from both lawyers, the judge ruled that the evidence was conclusive, and the charges were established. The defendant was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Raffle for Charity</p>

<h3>Shenzhen's Bloodstains</h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>On the third day of the Lunar New Year, as Hong Kong was filled with the sound of firecrackers and joyful cheers, nine × planes flew over Shenzhen Market in the early morning, wantonly slaughtering residents and creating the biggest blood debt of this year. They even crossed into British airspace – Luohu and Sheung Shui – indiscriminately dropping bombs and killing people with machine guns. This insane and inhumane act has been inflicted on the eleventh country. We will not dwell on it for now, but will record this blood debt.</p>
<p>Taking the train to Luohu at noon, the first thing that catches the eye is the tall building made of red bricks – the station building. The glass in the windows of the building has all been shattered, leaving only some broken frames swaying in the wind. This is the vicious result of the × planes' machine guns – many lives were lost here.</p>
<p>A few yards further on, the police substation built with cement has also collapsed. A huge and tattered flag hangs on the adjacent wall, marking that this territory was also hit by several bombs. Were the × planes unable to see clearly? Then why were two bombs dropped on the river opposite the Sheung Shui garrison camp? Can this still be denied?</p>
<p>A bomb also fell on the Shenzhen railway station platform. Countless people were killed along the road by × people's machine guns. Mounds of new sand, one pile after another, line the side of the road. An official from the refugee camp traveling with us told us that this is the temporary place to bury the compatriots who died in the disaster!</p>
<p>Running forward along the road, apart from a few of us in the same profession, there were only scattered people fleeing backward. Arriving at Shenzhen Market, all that could be seen were ruined walls and broken tiles, courtesy of the × planes. Five bombs fell on Nanqing Street, ten on Yun Sheng, and countless more on Yazi Street, Dongxin Street, Shangda Street, and Xixing Zheng Street. Suhang Street was also cut off from traffic by the bombing. The area near the police station was hit by the most bombs, and the back of the station was also blown up. A fire bomb also fell on the New Oriental Hotel, but fortunately, the fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a major disaster.</p>
<p>Dozens of bombs fell on the small market town. Can an inch of it be considered clean? On the street, all that could be seen were tangled electrical wires, roof beams, bricks, and tiles scattered everywhere. Stores that had miraculously escaped the bombing were all closed. Pedestrians were few and far between. Some hungry dogs sniffed the stench of blood, running around and licking. Piles of flies covered the bloodstained clothes, shoes, and socks on the road. The sound of new coffins filled with the newly deceased resonated in the air, and the stench of blood and decay permeated the air, piercing people's hearts and lungs.</p>
<p>Beside the pond along the Sha-Shen highway, there was a pile of minced meat, and a pair of hands and a foot had flown off to who knows where. The exposed intestines were blackened by the intense sunlight. A child of seventeen or eighteen was lying face down on the side of the road, with a bamboo basket beside him. On closer inspection, alas, it turned out to be the corpse of a girl torn apart by bombs, her face terribly gruesome. She died tragically under the bombs of the × people, and she will surely gnash her teeth in hatred in the afterlife.</p>
<p>In a side alley near the police station, an old woman sat on the ruins of her collapsed house, wailing, beating her chest and frantically digging through the rubble. She repeatedly cried out that she wanted to die. Fortunately, the people who came with her were able to persuade her to carry the things she had dug out of the rubble. Stumbling and sobbing, she cried out for her husband and her beloved son. The scene was extremely heartbreaking.</p>
<p>On the street, we met the guerrilla company commander, Que Mingguang. He patted his chest and said that the security here was very good and that no one would dare to steal a single coin. Speaking of the × planes' bombing, he gnashed his teeth and said that the × planes were really vicious. As soon as they arrived, they dropped bombs without even pausing for half a second, so everyone was unable to escape, which is why so many people were killed.</p>
<p>Amidst the rubble, there are still unknown numbers of unexcavated corpses buried. More than two hundred lives have been sacrificed at the hands of the × people. Who doesn't have parents, siblings, wives, and children? Can we bear to watch our relatives be slaughtered for nothing? No, we must make the greatest determination to settle this huge blood debt with the × people.</p>
<p>On the way back, we met County Magistrate Liang Feiren, who had just returned from Hong Kong. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings, we hurried to catch the train and did not have time to inquire about future relief measures. We bid him farewell in haste.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Committee Members to Inspect Counties Across the Province - Chairman Li Personally Inspects Northern Guangdong - Civil Affairs and Education Departments to Dispatch Inspectors Separately</h3>
<p>Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Li Jianhun believes that with the War of Resistance against Japan in South China in full swing, reforms of county administration in various regions during wartime urgently require the personal supervision and direction of himself and committee members, to meet the needs. Therefore, Committee Member Zhu Huiri has been specially assigned to inspect various counties in Xijiang, Committee Member Lin Yousong to inspect various counties in Nanlu, Committee Member He Tong to inspect various counties in Dongjiang, and Chairman Li himself to supervise various counties in Beijiang. In order to assist in examining the administrative situation of each county and assess its political achievements, the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education have been instructed to select senior officials to depart separately for inspection. Preparations are currently underway, and they are expected to depart for their respective areas soon. It has been decided that Committee Member Lin Yousong will be in charge of the Civil Affairs Department's affairs, acting on behalf of the department for daily administration. A large number of inspectors have also been dispatched to various regions to inspect the prohibition of opium in various counties. The original opium prohibition personnel in various counties will be dismissed to save expenses. It has been stipulated that all opium prohibition matters in the province will be handled by the Civil Affairs Department. The adjustment of county magistrate personnel in occupied or semi-occupied areas is actively underway. In addition to ordering the dismissal of Nanhai County Magistrate Zeng Zesheng for his lack of effort in the War of Resistance, and replacing the county magistrates of Conghua and Huiyang, the selection of qualified military leaders with strong military experience and knowledge to fill the positions of county magistrates in Sanshui, Shunde, Zengcheng, Huaxian, Qingyuan, Bao'an, Dongguan, and Longmen is also underway, in order to promote civilian resistance during the War of Resistance and strictly investigate local administrative personnel. Those found guilty of corruption, bribery, or protecting opium dens and gambling dens will be immediately detained and dealt with severely according to military law, in order to rectify officialdom. Furthermore, Education Department Director Xu has dispatched section chiefs, section members, clerks, and others to various temporary middle schools in the east, west, north, and south to manage everything, in order to plan for education during the War of Resistance. All middle and upper schools in the province have been ordered to practice economy, and funds for provincial middle schools, normal schools, and compulsory education in various counties are remitted on schedule. Zhang Zimo has been assigned to Xijiang, Zhou Siming to Nanlu, Han Guoqing to Qiongya, and Li Baihua to Beijiang, to inspect education in various counties, in order to cultivate talent and fulfill the responsibility of resisting the war and building the nation.

<h3>Yu Hanmou Inspects Defense</h3>
<p>As our army is actively reorganizing for a counteroffensive, Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Army Group, accompanied by his deputy commander and staff, inspected the garrison troops at a certain frontline location on the 15th of this month to inspect the defenses. In addition to receiving instructions from the officials, he gathered the officers and soldiers of the area to give a speech, stating that the War of Resistance had entered a new stage, and that combat strategies should be proactively sought to eliminate the Japanese invaders and recover lost territory. He then spoke of the eight military precepts: 1. Implement the Three Principles of the People; 2. Support the supreme leader; 3. Obey the orders of superiors; 4. Practice the New Life Movement; 5. Obey discipline; 6. Be loyal to one's duty; 7. Strive for learning; 8. Resist the war to the end. These are the highest guidelines for all actions of all officers and soldiers of this army group. Officers and soldiers must thoroughly implement them. Finally, he stated that the Japanese warlords invaded our country and were not only enemies of our country but also enemies of the good Japanese people. If the Japanese army surrenders to us, they will be treated preferentially. The puppet troops in the Japanese army are also our compatriots who are forced to fight. He hopes that they can automatically return to our revolutionary front. Those who kill enemies and return will be generously rewarded. He hopes that everyone will pay attention to and comply with this. After the speech, the officers and soldiers shouted slogans such as "Resist the war to the end!", "Down with the Japanese warlords!", and "Long live the Chinese nation!", their spirit high and their determination to swallow up the barbarians strong. Then, the officers and soldiers gathered for a meal to show their sincere unity and share the hardships. (Continental News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Occupation of Nantou - Withdrawing After Six Hours</h3>
<p>The Japanese invaded Shian County once on the 17th of the month, occupying it for only six hours before withdrawing. Yesterday, a staff member from the Shian County government office in Shenzhen informed the reporter of the details of what happened. According to reports, at 6 am on the 17th, the Japanese invaded from the direction of Taiping. He Ni ×jie, the head of the Taiping puppet maintenance association, also came with the Japanese. By that time, most of the residents of Nantou City had already evacuated, with only a few remaining. The Japanese troops entering the city numbered more than 200, but they belonged to the reconnaissance unit, stationed inside and outside the city. The Japanese army captain searched door-to-door for the person in charge to maintain order in the urban area. Later, he found a certain monk and forced him to take him to see Lei Xingmin, the county official remaining in the county government. Lei was only in the washroom. After seeing Lei, the Japanese captain immediately ordered him to provide the Japanese army with adequate tea and water. Lei said that the residents had all fled, making it difficult to supply. Later, he learned that there were still a few farmers who had not evacuated to the east of the county seat, so he ordered the farmers to be responsible for the supply. The Japanese captain then accompanied Lei and his party back to Da San Yuan Restaurant on Da Xin Street, forcing Lei to prepare meals for 300 Japanese soldiers within half an hour. Just as Lei was struggling to cope, the Japanese suddenly received a telegram and immediately withdrew without even having time to eat. They retreated in a hurry around noon, leaving by boat from Xixiang. The Japanese invasion of Nantou lasted no more than six hours. Before leaving, they threatened Lei again, saying that a puppet maintenance association meeting would be held in Taiping on the first, second, and third days of the Lunar New Year, and forcing Nantou and Xixiang to send representatives to participate, otherwise, they would carry out a large-scale bombing. This is the general situation of the fall of Bao'an County. Lei has already sent a long letter to the Shenzhen office reporting everything, saying that he will come to Shenzhen as soon as possible to report everything to the county magistrate in person.</p>

<h3>From Shantou to Saigon (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hua You</p>
<p>Claiming Luggage!</p>
<p>After arriving in Saigon, the first hurdle is going through the import procedures at the New Guest Office, as described above. The second hurdle is claiming luggage at the Luggage Pavilion. Previously, as soon as a ship docked, all the luggage would be moved into customs. Recently, overseas Chinese from the Seven Prefectures jointly invested (the so-called joint investment here is such that every Chinese person arriving in Annam has two cents added to their import tax, supposedly for building a new luggage pavilion) to build a Luggage Pavilion. The pavilion is located behind the customs. When you go there to claim your luggage, you must first obtain an entry permit and enter according to the order of the numbers. Unfortunately, most overseas Chinese do not follow this order. Everyone rushes to get in first, often enduring beatings from the French. In my opinion, their lack of orderliness stems from two reasons: 1. Illiteracy - The wooden fence at the entrance of the Luggage Pavilion is divided into two small doors, with signs posted beside each door indicating the male and female sections. The female entrance is often mixed with many "甲人" (unidentified people). This proves their illiteracy. 2. Lack of training - When they are pushing and shoving each other, if you stand nearby, you will often hear some unconscious remarks, such as "If you're afraid, you wouldn't have come abroad." When you ask them why they are crowding like this, they will answer without thinking, "You want to be fast, can't I be fast?" In short, it is impossible to reason with these people. Since they do not follow the order, they will naturally be beaten. Mencius often said, "People must insult themselves before others insult them." I say that the heads of many overseas Chinese are often beaten by others, and it is entirely their own fault.</p>
<p>The author's first hometown is in Saigon, so I always have to go home to visit my family every few years. Therefore, I am quite familiar with the procedures for claiming luggage. On the 25th, I called a brother early in the morning to help. That day, I went to the entrance of the Luggage Pavilion to get a luggage permit. Fortunately, the number on the entry permit was number 21. Because there was a lot of luggage, one person couldn't carry it all. Therefore, I negotiated with a "Mama" in the Luggage Pavilion (the "Mama" in the Luggage Pavilion is completely different from the "Mama" in the New Guest Office. One is responsible for handling the import documents for overseas Chinese, and the other is responsible for taking care of overseas Chinese claiming luggage.) With her help, I obtained the permission of the Arab guard to allow my brother to run in to help (because he did not have an entry permit, he had to ask privately). After searching for a long time inside, we were finally able to find the seven pieces of luggage. Many of the suitcases were badly damaged, and the bundles were covered in mud. Fortunately, nothing was lost. The management of the Luggage Pavilion is really terrible. The coolies carried the luggage from the ship to the Luggage Pavilion, throwing things around as if they were avenging their father's death. This is what I mean by those porters. Things stored in the Luggage Pavilion are not safe. If it is luggage like mesh baskets, things are lost particularly easily because they are not locked and are easily stolen. Other things, such as "一呷 (unidentified items)", are often damaged, locks are broken, and they are stolen clean. Even entire suitcases can disappear. In my opinion, the loss of things is not only suspicious of the guards, but also of those who go in to claim their luggage first, as they are also suspected of theft. Things are stored in the luggage room, allowing you to rummage through them at will. The guards only check your entry permit against the name written on the cloth strip (or paper) attached to the luggage. I ask, with such a method, can't people bring a few more cloth strips to tie to other people's luggage and prepare some keys to open them for the customs officers to inspect? Therefore, I say that the loss of luggage in the Luggage Pavilion is caused by theft from multiple parties.</p>
<p>After the things are moved out of the luggage room, it takes some time before you can cross another boundary. This boundary is blocked by an Annamese person using a wooden stick. Five people can pass at a time. If you exceed this number, you must wait patiently for him to move the stick before you can pass. At this time, I discovered a customs officer (this person is Annamese) with black glasses on his nose, who was messing around with things at the entrance of the luggage room, using his hands and even his feet. He actually "treated the customs as a playground and kicked the suitcases as if they were balls. Fortunately, the suitcases were strong, otherwise, they would have been in a mess." His expression was indeed a bit unbearable (not for a lifetime). Unfortunately, in the end, he was just a fox exploiting the tiger's might. His features were clearly typical of an Annamese person, but when you tried to deal with him in Annamese, he babbled in French. This made me regret a little that I shouldn't have learned their despised language. Now let's talk about the inspectors in customs. Most of the people working there are French "Madames". Each inspector must have an Annamese person acting as their accomplice. This time, I was inspected by a male French gentleman. His behavior can be said to be the most standard of French gentlemen in Annam. Now let me introduce him.</p>
<p>When I moved the luggage in front of him, he sat very imposingly on a rattan chair. An Annamese person acting as his accomplice sat beside him, rummaging through the suitcases and opening all the clothes, books, and dictionaries one by one for the French gentleman to see. If there was anything slightly good-looking, he could keep it at will. What I mean by "keep it" here should be explained in two ways: 1. Take it for himself, 2. Take it for taxation. Now let me give a few examples. Last time I returned to Saigon from Beiping to visit my family, a "Madame" forcibly took my photo album because she thought it was too cute. She said she should take it. (Please refer to my article "Impressions of the West Bank" in the 7th volume, 10th issue of the "Yu Gong" Semi-Monthly). At the time, there was nothing I could do about it. An overseas Chinese bought an exquisite small suitcase in Hong Kong, and because it was too exquisite, the French gentleman took a fancy to it and confiscated it. In short, if he thinks something is to his liking, whether it is an object or food, you have to give it up to him. As for clothes and other things, almost anything slightly intact has to be taxed. This time I came to Saigon, I originally intended to raise funds for schooling, so I brought a lot of supplies. Like a small alarm clock that has been used for more than two years, a Swedish washbasin that has been washed for many years, a flashlight, a bed curtain, and two blankets, all had to be taxed. Even the crepe scraps that my wife had used to make cheongsams over the years were weighed and taxed. This is really a bit shocking. At the time, if it wasn't for other incidental items, I would have really given those crepe scraps to them to patch up their torn clothes.</p>
<p>They have always been accustomed to seizing the luggage of overseas Chinese as described above. This time, when they inspected my luggage, they found two jade bracelets that I had brought to give as gifts. The French gentleman forcibly took one of them. At that time, I was thinking to myself that I had brought so much luggage, and when they started inspecting, I had already told myself that these things would have to be taxed at least one hundred yuan. Since he has now forcibly taken this jade bracelet, although I have sufficient reason to ask him for it, it would be too much trouble. Because many past experiences have told me that trying to reason with those kind of customs officers is foolish. At the same time, I also thought that this pair of jade bracelets had followed me from the distant motherland to this place, and now they are separated, which made me feel a little sad. While I was thinking this, the jade bracelet had already been stuffed into his pocket. But I was determined to deal with him after the taxes were paid.</p>
<p>When I was packing the scattered things back into the suitcase, I found that the other jade bracelet was also missing. The French gentleman had gone to another place for something, so I questioned the Annamese person who was acting as his accomplice. He always answered irrelevantly, saying "Take the things to pay the tax." I already understood the meaning of his words. So I pulled him up, and he had secretly placed the alarm clock behind his butt. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Good Football Show This Sunday: South China vs. Hong Kong League Charity Match. Both Lineups Are Set, Strengths Are Comparable, Worth Watching.</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's special report] The English Relief Association sympathizes with us. Since setting up a branch in Hong Kong, it has made remarkable achievements in providing relief to Chinese refugees.

<h3>General Review After Watching the Inter-City Matches</h3>
<p>First Battle</p>
<p>The Philippine football team came to Hong Kong for inter-city matches. In their first match against the Hong Kong inter-city team on the first day of the Lunar New Year, after ninety minutes of competition, the Hong Kong team proved to be superior in skill and achieved a resounding victory of four to one.</p>
<p>In the first ten minutes of the match, the Philippine team's "high-speed" performance was indeed formidable, and at that time, the situation seemed balanced. However, after fifteen minutes, the Hong Kong team's players performed at their best, gradually turning the match into a one-sided contest. Nevertheless, the Philippine team, with their efforts, only conceded one goal and finished the first half. Not long after the start of the second half, the battle became a tense situation with a score of two to one. From then on, the Hong Kong team controlled the entire field, frequently launching attacks, and finally won with a score of four to one.</p>
<p>Shooting Record</p>
<p>(First Half)</p>
<p>First goal: Lee Wai-tong (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>(Second Half)</p>
<p>Second goal: Lee Wai-tong (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Third goal: Lees (Philippines)</p>
<p>Fourth goal: Lee Wai-tong (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Fifth goal: Fu La (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>In this match, the Philippine team only had one scoring opportunity in the first half, which was Lees's shot, indicating that their forward line's offensive power was quite ordinary. In the second half, they also had only five scoring opportunities, and none of them were on target. On the other hand, the Hong Kong team had more than twenty shots close to the goal, but only achieved a success rate of four out of ten. This result is not satisfactory, and it also shows that they missed many opportunities.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Hong Kong team's victory is undoubtedly due to their superior football skills. However, the reason why they were able to cope with the high-speed Philippine team and prevent them from succeeding seems to be largely due to their "offensive defense." The three midfielders provided excellent cover, effectively supporting the defense during attacks, creating many opportunities to score. Lee Wai-tong's central breakthroughs were therefore particularly effective.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's players' skills are already familiar to us, and the spectators at the time also saw them clearly, so there is no need to repeat them. However, regarding the Philippine team's performance, I noticed the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The three forwards advanced and retreated simultaneously, resembling the "single-line" strategy used by Hong Kong football teams many years ago. Therefore, when they advanced, they had to rely on short passes and close attacks, without long-range breakthroughs.</p>
<p>(2) The two wingers always followed the progress of the three forwards, lacking individual styles of flanking attacks.</p>
<p>(3) The three midfielders were good at dribbling and attacking, and relied on their ample energy to run back and forth. They were more than sufficient in assisting the attack, but insufficient in assisting the defense.</p>
<p>(4) Although the two inside forwards were agile and fearless, they lacked crisp footwork to strike the ball directly, and their positioning was not ideal.</p>
<p>In summary, the only strength of the Philippine team's players was their speed and stamina. Most of them lacked experience, but their heading skills were quite good.</p>
<p>The lineups for both teams in this match were as follows:</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Team)</p>
<p>Tam Kwan-kan</p>
<p>Sze Hon, Lee Tin-sang</p>
<p>Leung Wing-chiu, Tik Chun, Hon Nei-wai-lo</p>
<p>Hau Ching-to, Ko Shan-nu, Lee Wai-tong, Fung King-cheung, Fu La</p>
<p>(Philippine Team)</p>
<p>Yao Ngor</p>
<p>Ba Chik-ko, Mo Lan-da</p>
<p>Wa Lee, Yao Kat-ti, Heung Na-ti-si</p>
<p>Pit Chi, Choi Lee, La La-sa-pai, Ha Lee-ti-a, Lee Yay-si</p>
<p>Second Battle</p>
<p>Of the three matches the Philippine team played here, their second match against the Chinese team on the 20th was their best performance. Having tasted Lee Wai-tong's central breakthroughs in the inter-city match, the Philippine team changed their strategy against the Chinese team and adopted the third inside defender method. Yao Kat-ti was responsible for monitoring Lee Wai-tong, ignoring everything else, following his every step. As a result, Lee Wai-tong's terrifying central breakthroughs could not be realized. However, Lee Wai-tong was an experienced veteran who could adapt to the situation. In the second half, he adopted a falling-back strategy, luring Yao Kat-ti far out, and then Lee Siu-wing and Chan Tak-fai attacked from the flanks, defeating the enemy and winning with a score of five to three.</p>
<p>The first half ended in a three-to-one draw. However, for at least two of the three goals conceded by the Chinese team, Tam Kwan-kan should be blamed for his mistakes. The three forwards also did not perform well initially. In the second half, Lee Wai-tong changed to a falling-back strategy, and the attacks suddenly intensified, causing constant scares in front of the Philippine team's goal. This also shows that the Chinese team's forward line had some advantages.</p>
<p>Shooting Record</p>
<p>(First Half)</p>
<p>First goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)</p>
<p>Second goal (penalty): Lee Wai-tong (Chinese team)</p>
<p>Third goal: Hau Ching-to (Chinese team)</p>
<p>Fourth goal: Hau Ching-to (Chinese team)</p>
<p>Fifth goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)</p>
<p>Sixth goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)</p>
<p>(Second Half)</p>
<p>Seventh goal: Lee Siu-wing (Chinese team)</p>
<p>Eighth goal: Lee Siu-wing (Chinese team)</p>
<p>In this match, the Philippine team used strategies, and the Chinese team was able to adapt to the situation and use strategies accordingly, making it a battle of wits. The performance was more exciting than the inter-city match.</p>
<p>In this match, I also noticed the following points in the Philippine team's performance:</p>
<p>(1) The defenders used a dense defense, but the central defender was restrained by Lee Wai-tong, and the two left and right defenders did not dare to venture far out, so their forward line received very little support.</p>
<p>(2) The forward line's style of play was largely the same as in the inter-city match, but their attacks were fiercer than in the first match, so they were able to achieve a draw in the first half.</p>
<p>The lineups for both teams in this match were as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Tam Kwan-kan</p>
<p>Lee Tin-sang, Mak Siu-hon</p>
<p>Hui King-sing, Leung Wing-chiu, Sung Ling-sang</p>
<p>Hau Ching-to, Lee Siu-wing, Lee Wai-tong, Chan Tak-fai, Tang Kwong-sam</p>
<p>Philippine Team</p>
<p>Wai Lan-nu-wa</p>
<p>Mo Lan-da, Heung Na-ti-si</p>
<p>Wa Lee-si, Yao Kat-ti, Tu</p>
<p>Pit Chi, Pao Choi-lee, La La-sa-pai, Ha Lee-ti-a, Lee Yay-si</p>
<p>Third Battle</p>
<p>This match was held yesterday. The north wind was extremely strong, and the ball was difficult to control due to the wind, which greatly affected the players' technical performance.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong United team initially faced a headwind, making it difficult to play. Although Liao Ya-chen initially scored a goal, the Philippine team soon equalized. The Philippine team then led 2-1 at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Philippine team scored another goal, and their momentum was at its peak. Most spectators thought that the Philippine team would definitely win this match and regain some face. However, the Hong Kong United team's situation later improved, and they relentlessly attacked, firing shots like arrows. Although Wai Lan-nu-wa tried his best to cope, he was eventually overwhelmed and unable to defend, so the Hong Kong United team scored three consecutive goals, winning 4-1. The Philippine team lost three times, and this hatred will linger. They will have to wait until the Hong Kong team visits the Philippines in April to seek revenge.</p>
<p>Shooting Record</p>
<p>(First Half)</p>
<p>First goal: Liao Ya-chen (Philippines)</p>
<p>Second goal: Pao Choi (Philippines)</p>
<p>Third goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)</p>
<p>(Second Half)</p>
<p>Fourth goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)</p>
<p>Fifth goal: Free kick Tang Kwong-sam (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Sixth goal: Chan Tak-fai (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Seventh goal: Chan Tak (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Overall, in the Philippine team's two performances, the goals scored by their forwards were all achieved by going deep into the defense, indicating that their skills were very poor. In summary, the Philippine team's technical level is far behind Hong Kong's, and they cannot compete with Hong Kong for supremacy for the time being.</p>
<p>This morning, the Philippine team took a ship to Macau to play a match. In the afternoon, they rushed back and will take the Italian postal ship Conte Biancamano back to the Philippines. (Football Field Deity)</p>
<p>The lineups for the two teams in yesterday's match were as follows:</p>

<p>Wa Lee-si, Yao Kat-ti-si, Heung Na-yay-ti</p>
<p>Pit Chi, Pao Choi-lee, La La-sa-pai, Tu, Lee Yay-si</p>
<p>(Hong Kong United Team)</p>

<h3>Knowledge of Physical Training Should Be</h3>
<p>-- Wang Xue Zheng</p>
<p>(1) Although most exercises can simultaneously develop muscles, strengthen internal organs, and build strength, if the muscles are too underdeveloped and you want to specifically develop muscles or make muscles as perfect as possible, you must engage in exercises that focus on muscle development. This type of exercise is slightly different from exercises that strengthen internal organs and build strength. Exercises that focus on muscle development require 60% to 85% of your full effort. The number of repetitions should be between 1 and 15 times. If you want to focus on strengthening internal organs, you must focus on torso exercises, requiring only 30% to 50% of your full effort. The number of repetitions should be around 10 times. The methods for building stamina and strength are different. To build stamina, you must practice exercises such as long-distance running and rope skipping, with a long duration. This type of exercise itself is relatively easy, but if you continue exercising for too long, the difficulty or the body's response is no less than strenuous exercise. Exercises that focus on building strength require you to exert full effort or more than 85% of your full effort. The number of repetitions should be between 1 and 3 times.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding muscle development, most people focus on the muscles of the upper body, especially the arms and abdomen. However, to make the body's muscles as perfect as possible, you must first develop the muscles of the legs. The legs can be said to be the strongest part of the body, and also the most difficult to train. In order for the body's muscles to develop to the most perfect level, you must practice strenuous exercises. If the leg muscles are too weak, even if you can handle strenuous exercises, you are at risk of injury. Seeing that leg training exercises can promote systemic circulation and are particularly beneficial to the heart and lungs. The legs are also the foundation of our body. Solid buildings must have a strong foundation. Our bodies are the same. To develop leg muscles, you must focus on strenuous exercises, but you must not ignore various easy leg exercises.</p>
<p>(3) The reason why our exercise needs to be both strenuous and light is because on the one hand, it wants to promote metabolism and blood circulation, and on the other hand, it makes muscle fibers grow and develop muscles. This kind of exercise can also be said to be "internal" and "external" development, most suitable for people with moderate or above physical strength.</p>
<p>(4) There are many types of freehand and equipment exercises. We cannot determine which is the best exercise. Sometimes exercise also needs to be "prescribed according to the symptoms" or vary from person to person. Exercises that are suitable for A are not necessarily suitable for B. There is no fixed standard for the exercise procedure.</p>
<p>(5) The movements must be thorough, and the posture must be correct. The exercise is to give the muscles the opportunity to stretch thoroughly on the one hand, and to contract thoroughly on the other hand.</p>
<p>(6) The breathing method must be correct. Under no circumstances should you stop breathing, otherwise the circulation and other systems will suffer great damage and can cause serious diseases such as the heart.</p>
<p>(7) Exercise should always have changes. Just for one muscle in the upper arm, the biceps, there are already dozens of training methods. If you want to make it develop to the most perfect place, you must take turns practicing all the exercises that train that part. However, during each exercise, the exercise of each part of the body should not exceed three types. In addition, exercise must also have progress. The progress of exercise is to increase the weight of the equipment and to improve the mode of exercise. When you start to exercise, you must start light and heavy. (Below)</p>

<h3>Pull Until It Breaks</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Perhaps it is Ms. Williams' subtle irony. She says that fascist politicians and military leaders should know a little geography, or at least a little geometry, and know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. As usual, politicians are able to pretend not to understand irony and ignore it, and irony naturally does not cause any repercussions. But it seems that they are also a little unwilling to be ridiculed, and unintentionally or intentionally, often to show their understanding, arbitrarily display their ability to draw lines.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a kind of geography education that calculates land not by area but by lines. Then it should not surprise us how we see a country of lines on the map. Vaguely speaking, its borders extend about 10,000 li from north to south and west to east, but we should never hope to estimate the area of its land from these approximate lengths and widths. If we feel that all real lines must have an area, then the width of this area is only one-one hundred and fiftieth of the length. If we put this on a map of the world with a scale of 1:40,000,000, then the shape of the Siberian Railway is exactly this length-to-width ratio.</p>
<p>We know that sometimes an imaginary line is enough to cause changes in world politics. Many people believe that the last World War was due to Germany's attempt to cut the three S lines, and the current turmoil around the Mediterranean is also aimed at attacking the three S lines. Italy is also thinking of creating another oblique three S line across North Africa from Sicily, through Sudan, to Somaliland. The three S lines are naturally often regarded as a very important line. However, the three S lines do not solely rely on a single line for connection. Both sides of the line are reflected by a vast background, while the country of lines can only form a thin line in its entirety. I don't know why they like to use the term lifeline. Perhaps they are self-aware that they only have a fragile line for life.</p>
<p>The maintenance of a line's life depends on the navy, which is criticized for being top-heavy. Being able to maintain a lifeline is already not easy, but those who are dreaming of a continental empire want to tie bombs to the line. They have already disregarded the fragility of the line itself, but still complain that the line is not long enough. The dream of extending the line originally existed, but the sudden desire to extend it at this time is still the result of mutual recrimination. On the whole, this only helps the function of tying bombs, but whether this extended weak line can be firmly tied to a small bomb depends on whether the troops pieced together by patching things up can scrape together something to find a burial place among the mountains. This island, which has little relationship with the continental war situation, still needs more than 100,000 troops in terms of restraining forces. The saying that there is no intention to occupy it for a long time, coming from the mouths of cunning people, although not credible at all, is not necessarily a retreat reserved for the lack of invading power.</p>
<p>The severe significance and impact of the invasion of Hainan Island on the Pacific situation is something we should naturally understand and believe, but we must also understand that it can by no means provide the impact that can be afforded by "easily occupying". When the troops are withdrawn because they cannot but retreat, we cannot believe any of their explanations. There is a passage in a short commentary in the Shanghai Translation News Weekly that we feel is worth introducing. The article says: "In the past, Japan's policy of quick war and quick surrender was to unite Wang Jingwei internally and to unite Germany externally, releasing harmonious air from time to time with ups and downs. Now he only uses the invasion of Hainan Island as an attempt to make his last quick knot. And this opinion, according to British Foreign Minister Cadogan, was instigated by Italy, but I even suspect that Wang Jingwei's opinion is also inside." Although we cannot hear Wang Jingwei's opinion at present, if Japan withdraws its troops, there will be people like Wang Jingwei who come out to speak. However, it is not necessarily a peace theory, or it is simply a puppet show.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei once dreamed of being a puppet in Guangzhou, and at that time he had requested a withdrawal hoax. But his partners were not happy, probably because they felt that the puppet was not big enough. As for Hainan Island, which is "of no benefit to itself" and cannot be "easily occupied," it may be used to exchange puppets. However, it is only "perhaps," and if the puppet harbors this hope, it will inevitably be disillusioned. Since a line has been extended, it has naturally caused the illusion of thinking it is longer, so the result may be to drag it hard until it breaks.</p>
<h3>Old Man</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>The old man had been lingering on the ridge for quite some time. When he stumbled up this ridge, the sun was not yet directly overhead, and the vast sky with one or two drifting clouds was so blue and so high. But now, the sun had already slanted to the west, towards the peak of Banner Mountain on the other bank of the Songjiang River, where the turbid waters flowed, and a beautiful sunset glow quietly reflected in the golden rays of the evening. The old man, however, sat alone on the ridge, blankly puffing on his dry tobacco pipe, allowing his shattered and heavy heart to churn with endless waves of sorrow.</p>
<p>The old man… the old man’s life was woven with countless threads of hardship and suffering…</p>
<p>From a young age, the old man had been suffering in poverty. Initially, he and his early widowed mother painstakingly cultivated other people's fields. Years later, one day, his mother suddenly collapsed and died in the field while working. From then on, he cultivated the fields that five or six people used to work alone. The weight of a thousand pounds of stone pressed down on him, almost suffocating him, but he simply rubbed his body with medicated wine and kept his head down, inhaling the scent of the soil. It was not until he was nearly forty that he married a wife to help him. From then on, he became increasingly old and frail, but fortunately, his only son grew up and, like him in his younger days, endured hardships without complaint, tightly gripping the hoe. Thus, after enduring all kinds of hardships and suffering, the old man felt a little comfort. Therefore, during sleepless nights, when he took a break from work and leaned on the handle of his hoe, watching his son’s sturdy arms swing under the sunlight, a faint smile would gently bloom from the corners of the old man’s parched lips.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly… it was truly a violent accident: like a sudden storm breaking a small flower that had just struggled to emerge from the thorns, the old man’s ray of comfort was suddenly shattered to pieces.</p>
<p>The events of this morning sent a chilling shiver down the old man’s spine as he thought about them…</p>
<p>His son had gotten up before dawn, splashed some water from the water tank and casually washed his face. Then, he picked up the sickle he had sharpened the night before and went to the fields to weed. After breakfast, he returned with muddy hands and feet, and then, carrying a fishing net, went to the big pond behind the house to catch fish.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that four “wooden shells” (gunmen) from the township office pointed to the old man’s house.</p>
<p>They were there to conscript his son.</p>
<p>But how could this be?</p>
<p>“I only have this one son! Without him, we would starve to death!” The old man pleaded mournfully.</p>
<p>Moreover, weren’t there many families in the village with three or four sons?</p>
<p>However, the township office did not care about these things…</p>
<p>"Will he go or not? If he doesn’t go… we’ll seize him."</p>
<p>Banging the table fiercely, the four guns pointed at him, and even if you were the only son, you had to go with them.</p>
<p>Was it kidnapping? Was it robbery?</p>
<p>The old man slumped weakly onto the table. A dark cloud, a flash of bright green, and a swirling mass of golden light appeared before his eyes.</p>
<p>His old wife wailed in a hoarse voice, tore off her headscarf, and banged her head against the wall with a thudding sound.</p>
<p>A chaotic jumble of thoughts swirled rapidly in the old man's mind—the old man suddenly widened his frightening eyes, and without saying a word, he rushed out of the gate, stumbling along the winding village path to the township office…</p>
<p>However, the township head sat majestically in his chair, "Money!" he spat. Without money, he was stern and unapproachable. The old man was thus dragged out of the township office gate, and the butt of the “wooden shell” even struck him on the head.</p>
<p>A mixture of anger and sorrow welled up, but the old man could not shed tears. He simply silently swallowed the unpayable hatred, and then, blankly, he set out on his journey home.</p>

<h3>Starting with Couplets</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>× People’s minds are magical, truly like mercury seeping into every crevice. In the occupied areas, not only must we be subjected to the tyranny of the enemy in terms of material life, but × people also drill in everywhere, even in religious beliefs, taking the opportunity to poison our minds. According to a newspaper report from the other day:</p>
<p>"Shanghai Special Dispatch, the puppet city government is approaching the time for the people to send off the Kitchen God. It has printed 100,000 images of the Kitchen God in color and sent them to residents in the four suburban areas. The images are embedded with slogans such as 'Japan-China-Manchukuo Cooperation, Nine Clans Harmonious' and couplets such as 'Respect the Kitchen God and sincerely pray for lasting celebrations and three meals a day, Cultivate Good Neighborliness and properly pray for the arrival of the Five Blessings...'"</p>
<p>This is the consistent style of slaves flattering their masters, and it is not at all surprising.</p>
<p>Originally, the usual couplets for sending off the Kitchen God in the north mostly wrote, "Report great words and good deeds above, protect peace and security in the world below." It seems that in addition to respecting ghosts and serving spirits, there was still no thought of quickly leaving the world and the country. However, these two sentences certainly left room for flattery in front of the × people’s slaves and lackeys. Naturally, in the current occupied areas, under the power of the × puppet regime, there is no "peace" to speak of. Then, when sending off the Kitchen God on the twenty-third evening, perhaps worshipping ghosts and respecting gods would evoke thoughts of the country. Therefore, clever slaves who flattered their masters came up with this good idea, so that the compatriots in the occupied areas would continue to revolve and think about things like "Japan-China-Manchukuo Cooperation" or "Cultivating Good Neighborliness," temporarily anesthetizing themselves.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of precedents for such things. I remember in the winter of the year of the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese also forced all households in the Northeast to paste New Year couplets specially made by the Japanese police, writing things like "Fuse East Asian Ethnicities, One Heart, One Mind, Build a New Country Together, Coexist and Prosper," with the horizontal inscription being "Imperial Grace is Vast." In fact, the people who came up with the plan were still slaves doing the work of dogs, and the handwriting was still from the hands of the Chinese. The reason for killing traitors and running dogs is even more reliably justified here.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a group of people who constantly spare no ink or effort in arguing over the few words "Advocating Peace Means Being a Traitor." On the surface of the words, although they repeatedly deny having any suspicion of being a traitor, judging from the saying "The more one argues, the more guilty one seems," their guilty and timid state has been completely exposed. In fact, the few words "Advocating Peace Means Being a Traitor" are still a sentence that needs to be explained and can be extended. If it were truly like the armistice conditions in the 27th issue of the Da Feng magazine, we would never close the door to negotiations. However, what is noteworthy is that it is clear that we have not been defeated, but a group of slaves insist that we have been defeated. It is clear that we cannot compromise and seek peace, but they have first agreed on the conditions with the × people, made their treacherous plans, and forcibly stamped the foreheads of the four hundred seventy million citizens with the mark of a conquered slave. This, then, is a 100% slave style.</p>
<p>The × people's tricks seem to have been exhausted today, because they have used them all, both hard and soft. What is extremely noteworthy are the slaves who act as accomplices to the tigers, who have endless methods of flattery, scheming, and poisoning China. They can stir up trouble, but they can also seize topics to make extended and far-fetched remarks, confusing the masses and anesthetizing the masses. However, if we start with the Shanghai municipal government's flattery in printing images of the Kitchen God and couplets, we can also infer the intentions and flattering style of the slaves. By understanding one thing, we can understand three things, and the future actions of the other × slaves can probably be predicted to some extent.</p>
<h3>A Small Opinion</h3>
<p>— You Di</p>
<p>Regardless of north or south, regardless of old or young, everyone must strive for the War of Resistance. Therefore, the cultural circles in this port also need to stand in their own positions and start working. The task of cultural workers here is also to concentrate their efforts on eliminating traitors and striving for unity and upward mobility among the backward, promoting and coordinating the work of other departments, and developing the power of their weapons under the goal of defeating national × people and completing national liberation!</p>
<p>In the past, all work tasks had not been touched as tasks, and the work was scattered and disorganized. Especially after the "Wang incident" occurred, the inadequacy of the work and the poverty of power became even more apparent! Therefore, the issue of building a united front in the cultural world, which is currently being raised, should attract the attention and strength of all cultural workers in the port. Regarding this important issue, there is indeed a need for extensive discussion. Here, I would like to express a small opinion. My opinion is: the organization should be broad, and the work should be subdivided; use unity to develop work, and use work to consolidate unity.</p>
<p>First: From the literal meaning, the "Cultural United Front" must be a broad combination of the cultural circles. If the scope of the organization is small, it can only be called a "battle point." There are still many points besides it. This does not mean accumulating points into a line. What is needed is the collection of all points, standing in a horizontal row, each person holding a gun and aiming at the front × people, regardless of front or back, firing bullets together. This is the battle line. Not only is there a main brain, but more importantly, there must be troops. Not only must all progressive and energetic new people gather on the front line, but also the doors must be opened to attract the backward and transform them, because their feet are firmly planted in another group. If they do a good job, the harvest will be quite considerable. Otherwise, it will not become a "United Front." But the "United Front" is not a "den of complacency." If there are decadent and rebellious elements within the front line, or elements that cannot be transformed, they must be eliminated without leniency; otherwise, it will not even qualify as a "front line." This is the military annotation to the need for a broad organization.</p>
<p>Second: With an organization and work, the principles of the work need to be determined together by everyone, and a program should be established; but the specifics of the work cannot be done without division of labor. There is no "jack-of-all-trades" in the world, so everyone can only choose what they are familiar with and do it. Within the battle line, the division of labor can be as detailed as possible, establishing many special research and work departments, where workers can have their regular places of effort. However, all departments need to have close ties, so that all work can be for the same purpose. At present, it is best not to give Mr. Hua Wei-style workers the opportunity to estimate things. Work is something that can be "firmly and steadily established." "Jack-of-all-trades" not only do not do things well, but they are truly unable to do them. Therefore, the work must be subdivided.</p>
<p>Third: Since the organization is broad, internal unity becomes a major issue. There must be a vertical system within the battle line, and there must also be horizontal connections. Each member is a single iron ring, connected to form an iron chain, a tight line. Only in this way can there be struggle. Not only must there be unity within each department in order to work, but each department, in other words, the entire battle line, must have the greatest unity in order to make the work progress according to plan. In terms of existing groups, the only shortcoming is that they are a ragtag army. The participants have not yet recognized who their comrades are. The situation is like scattered sand, which makes it impossible to work. At the same time, we can make further observations and know that it is not enough to rely on gatherings to unite a broad battle line. Every member must participate in the work and be able to obtain the true meaning of the struggle in the work. And in the process of work, make everyone get collective review, criticism, and guidance. Under this urgent need of everyone, the closest unity will inevitably be produced. Conversely, without work, there is no way to unite all kinds of people, people who know each other and people who do not know each other. At this time, the members within the battle line are comrades in the meeting, and after the meeting, they are individuals who have nothing to do with the organization. And the organization is left with a sign—therefore, unity and work are closely related. Without unity, there is no way to work, and without work, there is no way to unite. The only slogan is: Use unity to develop work; use work to consolidate unity.</p>
<h3>The Way Out for Educated Youth</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Originally, our country has many strong men, and the source of soldiers is not a problem at all. There is no need for educated youth to join the military with guns. Therefore, Ms. Song Meiling recently published an article saying that students only need to directly or indirectly awaken the anti-Japanese consciousness of the people during the war and improve the lives of the people, which is enough.</p>
<p>However, these words are Ms. Song's intention to care for educated youth, that is, the path of educated youth to serve the country is even better than being a soldier, not that they absolutely do not need to be soldiers. Therefore, if we combine her words with Chairman Chiang's order the other day urging the children of party and government personnel to join the army enthusiastically, we can discover that their intentions are exactly the same: every educated youth should shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, either going to the front line to fight or engaging in national salvation movements in the rear. The children of party and government personnel are of course all educated youth. Since the War of Resistance, although Chiang Ching-kuo's leading troops and fighting and the death of Vice Chairman Feng's eldest son in Nanyuan are enough to set an example for these children, there must still be a majority who are living in a drunken stupor or living in leisure. Chairman Chiang wants them all to enlist in the army, not only to set an example for the people, but also to strengthen the strength of the War of Resistance. In fact, he has clearly designated another way for educated youth to serve the country. We maintain this position.</p>
<p>I think that every educated youth who can go to the front line to fight should go to the front line to fight, and those who can be active in the rear should be active in the rear. These are the two paths they should take now. Reading, studying hard, and doing everything possible to engage in national salvation, of course, can also be included in the scope of rear activities. Educated youth, cherish this opportunity, do not give up your responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in my personal opinion, it is better for educated youth to do their best on the front line than to do their best in the rear. Because hiding in the rear, it is inevitable to have the suspicion of avoiding responsibility, and there will be abuses of abandoning responsibility. I think their influence will be very great, whether on the front line or in the rear, once they go to the front line. Chairman Chiang's order may have some meaning in this regard!</p>
