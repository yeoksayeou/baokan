<p>社評</p>
<h3>日軍進犯海南島的政治作用</h3>
<p>近幾個月來，社會上盛傳日本間牒開始潛入海南島方面活動，注意中日戰局的人，卽斷言日×不久將有進犯該島的企圖，蓋日×每於軍事行動之前，就預先佈置間牒網，同時間牒工作也必格外活躍果然×軍於十日晨黎明在海南島登陸了。日本軍閥企圖進攻海南島，去年六月間曾經一度嘗試過，乃以英法政府聯合提出嚴重抗饑，同時法　以相當雄厚的艦隊，嚴障以待，×因鑒於國際形勢對已不利，故暫時知難而退。迨至去年九月間德捷危機最嚴重的時期，它也曾集中艦隊，企圖乘機進犯，卒以慕尼黑協定成立，歐戰於無形中『消弭』，它的陰謀因而沒有實現。但是這次它爲什麽敢於貿然進犯呢？　我們的觀察。其作用和原因尙有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，　武漢和廣州失守後，×軍一面因兵力薄弱，一面則忙于補充少調整，這三個多月來軍事行動差不多等於停頓。最近雖在進攻西北截斷中蘇國際路線，以及進攻北海，侵入南寧，隔斷桂越交通的企圖，然以我方預有週密的佈置，其狡計卒未得逞。現在正值×議會第七十四屆開會之期，十九個月來×軍侵華無功，財政已瀕於破產境地而外交則陷於四面楚歌之中，戰爭結束，遙遙無期，目前實在是「戰不能，欲罷不得」，而其國民則感到萬分恐惶和焦急，逐漸由厭戰階段而踏入反戰的階段，革命危機的激化，一天深似一天，如最近各戰場上日軍反戰行動已漸趨積極，本屆議會中，政友會議員河野等對於平沼內閣加以激烈的抨難，竟公然批評軍部法西斯支持下的「平沼內閣，爲日本有史以來，最不孚人望之內閣」，凡此種種，均為日人對戰事失了信心，軍事政活行將崩潰的暗示。在這種情勢之下，日軍都擬欲提出的本年度軍費七十二萬五千萬元的龐大預算，在國會中必將引起激烈的爭辯，實難，實無疑問。因此日軍閥不得不乘此時機，製造一新事件，一則藉以刺激其萎靡不振的國民精神，一則使軍費預算得在國會中容易通過。這就是他們進攻海南島的原因之一。特別是海軍方面，自七七事件浚，因欲旗陸軍　功，屢次力主南侵，加以本年度海軍預算僅及陸軍的三分之一，爲圖增加預算，所以進侵海南島，海軍比較陸軍尤爲急進，積極。</p>
<p>第二，在戰略上，×軍佔領海南島，卽可控制香港，威脅法屬越南，星加坡非律演，截斷英美法與遠東的交通，所以進犯海南島的企圖，在×大本營處心積慮，已非一日。過去雖曾數度嘗試，而尙未見其有積極行動者，因爲戰時的日本對英美所取的外交策略，乃是所謂媚美排英，一旦佔領海南島，不但可引起英法很大的反響，且可因菲律賓受到威脅，而激起美國的惡感。這是他一年多以來，躊躇不敢貿然冒險的一個大原因。去年十二月四日羅斯福總統在第十七六屆議會發表演說，主張民主國家應聯合制裁侵略國，繼之主張修改中立法，設防關島；美商且拒絕售賣飛機與日本，世人認爲難以實現的英美合作，巳隨着國際形勢的變遷而日漸具體化了。民主國家的聯合行動似巳到成熟的階段。由此可見日本媚美外交的失敗，加以英美貸欵援華，益加積極，日軍閥處此進退失據的境地，索性硬着頭皮，冒一絕大的危險，夢想萬一能達到它們的威脅目的，使英美法或能有所讓步，斷絕對我援助，這也是它們進攻海南島的一個原因。</p>
<p>第三，自巴薩龍納陷入意德支持下的叛軍之手以後，意大利在地中海的地位日佔優勢，墨索里尼對法的領士要求，所採取的手段，日益強硬，觀於近日意軍增防北菲里比亞，卽知其用意何在。至於德國索同殖民地的運動迄未放鬆，推行東進政策，仍甚積極。日本爲欲執行德意日軸心的國際侵略政策，與德意東西相呼應，故也不得不進行佔領海南島的企圖。由日軍進犯海南島這一點看來，也許不久歐洲會爆發比較去年九月間更加嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>十日日海軍發言人稱：『日本佔據海南島，目的有二：（一）增强軍火之封鎖，（二）早日擊破中國，了結戰爭』，這只是自欺欺人的把戲，並非其眞實的用意。我國對外交通，除滇越，桂越之外，尙有中蘇和滇緬兩條路線，若說佔據海南島，即能封鎖中國軍火輸入，早日擊破中國，那簡直是痴人說夢！</p>
<h3>潮汕的青年救亡運動</h3>
<p>— 張問強</p>
<p>鄕村的土豪劣紳，　藉着封建勢力，横行鄕曲，敲民衆，抗戰發生以來，並不稍爲歛跡，土劣的横行直接　民衆以沉重的壓迫，使在後方尙未給　×這接摧殘的民衆，覺得　紳權長的可惡更甚於×人，不覺悟的土　　　之行爲，在鄉村中　是動員民　的一　障碍．</p>
<p>西的靑年爲了鞏固和擴大抗日民族統一戰綫，反封建的鬥爭，也只能在破　統一戰綫的限度內進行，對於森紳鄕晨之　，極力避免不要的　際，經常忍讓與之周旋，希望能够提髙他們的政治警覺性，運用他們的優越地位號召民衆向××漢奸作生死的鬥爭。但是，避免摩擦也應該有一個限度，不應該因　避免磨擦就連救亡運動也讓人去破壞。假使有人要破壞救亡運勳，救亡工作者就應該以適合環境的鬥爭精神對付他。對於未覺悟的豪紳們之敲榨壓迫的行爲，救亡靑年爲了發揮民衆的抗×力量，不能不予以消極或種極的阻止，因此，靑救運動，封建勢力難免要起衝突。在鄕村間還相當雄　的對建勢力遂成爲靑救運動的阻障。</p>
<p>派的成見，在潮汕，至今還未消除，由於宣傳不普　，國共合作的眞相，潮汕民衆尚多沒有淸楚的認識。說到共產黨還有人要談虎色變，所以豪紳之輩常把『紅帽子』加在救亡靑年的頭上，作爲破瓊靑救運動的手段。靑救運動被人指爲是某一個政黨的活動，這種誣蔑的確使它的發展遲侵了許多。幸而封建勢力的阻得，已隨統一戰綫的擴大和××進攻的加緊而在逐漸減少了。</p>
<p>動員民衆，是一個多麽醒鉅的工作。這種工作，在潮汕，大部分是要靑年負担的。因爲工作太繁重，　覺得自己的力量太薄弱，尤其感覺到幹部的缺乏。</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，因爲政治環境不容許救亡運動的公開發展，潮汕靑年參加救亡運動的也有極少數的積極份子，在偉大的時代裏，担當得起幹部工作的也只有少數有工作歷史的靑年，所以在廣泛的靑救運動中處處都感覺到幹部的缺乏。抗戰發生以後，雖然已經在實際的鬥爭培養了不少堅强的幹部。但是，救亡工作也跟着抗戰的進行而益增艱鉅了，工作範圍也益加擴入和深入了。幹部缺乏的困難依</p>
<p>經費支細也是一個不小的困難，阻止了潮汕靑救運動的進展。各地靑抗會的會員多是失業失學的知識靑年，他們不重視個人的利益，把全部精力都貢献給救亡工作，自己的生活都不能維持，只能繳納極輕的會　。各地靑抗會除少數外交工作的得比較好的經費稍爲充裕外，大多數是經費支絀阻止了工作的進行。比方，各地靑　會想要開辦夜學，敎育民衆，但是運買　水紙張的錢都籌不到，沒有辦法進行。許許多多的工作，往往因爲沒有錢而停頓起來。經費支細，在潮汕靑救運動甲確是一個相當因難的問題。</p>
<p>現階段的中心任務</p>
<p>潮汕是國防前綫，廣州失陷以後，也可說是×人的後方了。抗戰一開始，在×人海軍威脅下的潮汕巳露出了嚴重的危機，跟着抗戰形勢的開展，潮汕愈益迫近戰爭的危機了。</p>
<p>第　階段的抗戰，我軍事當局已决定實施全面　術，卽發動廣泛的游　戰與運動戰，保持擴大的面積，不和×人作點與綫的爭奪，潮汕方面無重要城市，亦無重要的軍事據點，叚如×人來攻，我們當不和×人作陣地戰與正規戰，而將以游擊戰未疲困×人，消滅漢姦，保衞潮汕</p>
<p>抗戰再擴展下去，潮汕將成爲埋葬×人之游擊區。潮汕的民衆救亡運動當以準備游擊戰爲中心的任務，爲民衆救亡運動之中心力量的靑救運動也應該為著凖備游擊戰而斗爭。基于這一認識，潮汕青年已積極凖備發動游擊戰爭，作爲現階　的中心任務。</p>
<p>×人到來　攻的時候，假如民衆沒有充分的准備，必然會呈現一種異常慌張的紊亂狀態。在紊亂的狀態中要立卽發動武裝民衆的游擊戰是可能的。目　的準備工作實有着迫切的需要，其成就如何足以次定將來游擊</p>
<p>潮汕有幾個形勢極佳的游擊隊根據地，如潮　惠一縣之間的南山，安　　三縣之間的鳳凰山。綿亘安揭二絲之桑浦山，　順的桐子洋等都是內戰時代的紅軍根據地，可作爲未來潮汕抗日戰爭游擊隊之大本營，潮汕靑年對于上回幾個未來游擊隊的根據地巳經進行佈置的工作。目　民運工作就特別注重于各個根據地附近的民衆之訓練與組織，以鞏固各個根據地的外圍，汕頭靑抗會已派出了三個工作隊到桑浦山的附近。進行民運工作。各地青抗會亦按照同樣的方針開展其</p>
<p>潮汕靑年的救亡工作愈深入民衆，所遭退到的困難亦愈益增加其程度；幹部更加缺乏了，封建勢力的阻碍更加增多了，經費也更加覺得支絀了，潮池靑年目前正在爲着克服上逮的困難而爲鬥。第一，加緊培養幹部。一個　强的幹部的養成雖然必須經過工作的鍛鍊，而基本學識之修養也是必要的，嶺靑通訊處和汕頭靑抗會爲造就幹部，曾經開辦一個短期訓練班，講　游擊戰術。國際政治，三民主義的三種科目，增幼受訓練者的基本學識，能使担當起史多的工作，接受更多的鍛鍊，更快成爲精明的幹部。第二，促或統一戰　之擴大與鞏固。經過隆降的炮聲與軋軋的機聲警吿，以潮汕民　必更能認識同舟共　的意義，潮汕靑年正好趁此機會，消滅內部的一切摩　；使　得更順利進行。促成統一戰綫的擴大和鞏固的工作有了成績之後，經費困難問題也就容易解決了。假使靑年的工作熱情得到了整個社會的同情，社會人士都能認識靑年工作的値價，那末，要籌備多少工作的費用是不會困難的。</p>
<p>潮汕靑年正在以最大的努力，準備游擊戰爭，未來潮汕的命運，大部份决定於今日靑年之凖備工作。潮汕靑年加倍努力，加緊奮鬥！</p>

<h3>蔣委員長談話　揭發乂控制太平洋野心　指出海南島軍事重要性</h3>
<p>【重慶十一日中央社電】蔣委員長十一日晨應外國新聞記者之請，對於日軍在海南島登陸問題發表其意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）問：日本此次進窺海南島，其真意究竟何在？答：海南島日軍登陸問題、吾人應就遠東海洋整個局勢上觀察，乃可認識其意義與影影響之重大。蓋海南島在東亞爲太平洋印度洋　戰略上主要之重心，×軍若佔領該島，不僅能完全阻　香港與新加坡間之交通，切斷新加坡與澳洲間之聯絡，而且使菲律賓亦受其控　，此不僅直接威脅法屬安南，實爲完全控制太平洋海權之發軔。該島若歸日軍掌握，則日本海軍向西可由印度洋以窺地中海，在東面卽可以斷絕新加坡·夏威夷島·珠港·英美海軍根據地之聯絡。故日軍此舉，顯係對於去年美艦訪　新加坡之一種答復。</p>
<p>（二）問：何以日本此舉爲控制太平洋海權之發軔？答：吾人皆知日本在太平洋上有三個最重要之戰略據點，在北爲樺太島，在西爲海南島，在東爲關島，日本欲取得整個制海權，對此三地皆不能忘懷，如三者皆落日本之手，則菲律賓與夏威夷卽等於爲日本所佔領。現在樺太島日本已據有其半，今又企圖占領海南島，以截斷英國海軍向東與美國取得聯絡。苟此種計劃不受阻止，則日本進一步勢將更謀控制關島。如此不僅可阻止美國海軍之向西，且將隔絕與菲律賓之聯絡綫。日本爲遂行其南進政策，且獨霸太平洋，其欲造成此三大據點之聯絡綫，處心積慮，已有三十年之久。當民國二十五年（一九三六）日本搜造所謂北海事件時，其用意卽在作爲進窺每南島之藉口，終因顧忌各國，不敢發動。今竟毅然不顧一切，而公然進犯海南島，若非有意挑起世界戰爭，即爲其侵華軍事最後冒險之一着。以數十年遲遲不敢輕發者，一旦决然實行，此不僅爲中日戰爭開始以來第一件最大事件，實爲三十年來太平洋局勢改變之惟一關鍵。日本旣不惜揭破其野心，則凡與遠東關係最深切之國家，自不能任此種危險的企圖之　行無阻。要知道在日本整個海軍影勢上說來，海南島是日本在太平洋西面第二道門戶，而關島則是其在太平洋東面之第二道門戶。</p>
<p>（三）問：然則日本在東面之第一道門戶卽最前衞何在？蔣委員長對此笑而答日：此在歐美人士，皆巳明瞭者，美國人士必知之要審，無待　言。</p>
<p>（四）問：日本佔領海南島，將影響遠東和平至何利程度？答：要解答此題，須知日軍今年（一九三九）二月十日之淮窈海南島，即等於一九三一年九月十八日之佔領潘陽。換言之，日本之進攻海南島，無　造成太平洋上之『九一八』。地區容有海陸之分，影響却完全相同。回憶瀋陽事變發生時，除美國當時國務卿史汀生以外，其餘各國當局，均不予措爲，日本乃得繼續擴大　侵略。迄今八年，竟造成其悍然獨覇東亞之形勢，增長其征服世界之氣焰。今日本又進攻海南島，如任其佔領　據，吾料其不及八年，其設計中之海空軍根據地，即可初步完成。於是太平洋上之形勢，必將突然大變，法國　欲在安南設置海軍根據地，美國縱欲從事關島之設防，亦將時不及待。故日本之决然南進，並非欲藉此以求中日戰事之結束，而　證明其不惜今後之冒險以造成太平洋戰局之開始也。</p>
<p>（五）問：中國對於海南島方面有何佈置？答：中國因　海軍，故不能專守海岸線，但早巳凖備一切陸上之佈置，在島上必與×軍盡力週旋，决不使其輕易佔領，至對於日軍淮犯北海一層，我方早有周密佈置與戒備，必予以堅强之打擊。且此舉在×人侵華戰事之本身上，無若何意義，紙有陷入於更大之不利地位，此在一般軍事觀察家均所洞悉也。</p>
<p>（六）問：日軍在海南島登陸，對於中日戰事有何影嚮？答：日軍在海南島登陸，對於我國抗戰，並無多大影嚮，因中日戰爭之勝敗，必取决於陸上軍事之行動，一島之佔領與否，根本無關重要云。</p>

<h3>轟炸中過株州</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>湘潭舊地重『逢』，倍覺親切有趣一入城便滿懷着希望，跑到縣府去找熟人，可是他們都改行到前方服務去了；但我幷不感覺失望，反覺可喜司賀！看縣府門前佈告，新任縣長王季輝氏，接事還沒有幾天呢。王氏是該縣頗負公正聲望的士紳，他以本地人做本地官，很有一番抱負，計劃將該縣一百一十萬人口中所有的壯丁提調出來，加以嚴格訓練，全副武裝，以作保國衛鄉人力上的大貢献。這不是臨時抱佛脚的事，因該縣壯丁過去受過訓的，計達××萬人，實力巳屬可觀，不過他們的年齡是廿五歲至卅五歲，今後則擬增加其年齡限制，成爲十八歲至四十五歲，如是則全縣可多動員壯丁××萬人，民衆抗×情緒，非常的高漲，如輸捐財物，慰努傷兵，供給軍運佚子，莫不一唱百和，踴躍參加，一般人民生活，大體能維持小康狀態。苦力因工作機會多，工資收入亦增加，如人力車夫每日可得二元左右，船夫及肩挑可得一元餘，軍運佚子，照例至少亦得五角，故生活都反較平時顯出舒適的現象。</p>
<p>——上述這段樸實無文的資料，是縣府一位老於世故的科員吿訴我的，這科員的談吐，雖然有些木鈉，但熊度非常謹愼，不失爲老成謀『縣』的人物。這次晤談，雖卑無髙論，但給我的印象，却極其深刻。我候在縣府的一個　式大客應中，這科員穿着皮袍，昂然定入，先遠立向我一鞠躬，旋　道姓氏而坐下，接着跟進來一个身材髙大的壯丁，科員好像要介紹人似的先望望我，後望望他，但實際上幷不介紹，而是從容不迫地站起身來，伸手入衣襟裏去掏，掏了一會掏出大洋一番，叫壯丁買得紙烟一盒，檳榔數口來招待——這都非我口福所及，尤其其辣無比（因用石灰及辛辣藥料黨製而成）的檳榔，前來湘時曾有一食而破口脣牙的經驗（但當地好食如烟酒，據可助消化），謹心領而辭謝。俟開始談詁，到了緊要關節，科員便以先禮後兵的態度，向我提出嚴重質問，說我到縣府去採訪，驟府并不曾奉到什麼公文。於是我連忙把『護身法寶』——不是「千人縫」而是軍用證明書——取給他看，才算撥開暗雲，得繼續談話。同時他一揮手間，壯丁也失望地退了出去。</p>
<p>這也難怪他要這樣過分的小心；因爲在前一個月，有人假冒申報推銷員名義，在湘潭，湘鄉，邵陽一帶推銷申報，說上海申報是怎樣維持固有精神復刊，香港申報是怎樣艱苦奮鬥擴充篇幅，爲使內地讀者訂，起見。故特派人前來推銷云云。理由說的相當動聽，所以有些機關學校，便向彼直接訂閱，俟久不見報，才知受騙。記者當即擬一廣告，說明本報向不派人在外單獨推銷等情由，送請當地報館發表，以杜後患。</p>
<p>夜宿旅館，竟有『不速之客』的賣唱妓。相繼直入旅客房間，藉口生計困難，各出戲目，堅請買唱調劑。一旅客拒絕不了，竟發脾氣說：『什麽生計困難不困難？這簡直和在精衛乞和通電一樣，自欺欺人，誰理你們這一套！』此公快人快語，罵妓竟拉汪精衞奉陪，可謂妙想天開；然我爲汗精衞痛惜！</p>
<p>從湘潭赴長沙，水陸交通均便。我想先去汨　視察，特搭東開湘黔車至株州，轉　漢車北上。湘黔路通到株州，卽與浙贛路啣接，兩路每日互開直接通車一次，東可暢通浙江金華，西則將達黔邊××。株州旣是華中縱横兩幹線的中心站，當然逃不過×人的轟炸騷擾，車站巳炸成敗垣頹牆，修車廠亦巳喬遷他處，附近數十家旅館商店更被燒炸得祗殘餘着一片瓦礫及灰爐。此間商店民居，建築多用木料，一被投彈燃燒，災禍極爲慘烈！然×機雖不斷在株州肆虐，但投彈漫無標的，對兩路運輸交通，從未受其阻得。且我一般鐵路員工（不僅株州站），均能勤奮　事，富有犧牲精神，一知何處路軌橋樑或路基被炸，卽運隨壞隨修之原則，於極快時間，趕往修復，火車上還裝備無線電收音機，可隨時聽取警報，以便將車停駛（若近山洞，則退入其內），令乘客敬避山野田間。是以×機十八个月來威脅兩路之結果，對雙方軍事上幷無若何影響，不過徒暴露其殘暴之行，激發我敵愾之心而巳。</p>
<p>在站上候車，無意間遇着剛從上海來的三位榮譽傷兵。於是我們向着午前微弱的陽光，便攀談起來。他們是胡眾南的部下，在淞滬戰時帶了重傷，直到最近才痊愈，承××救濟委員會照料，把他們化裝乘輪先送温州，後由他們自已乘汽車赴金華，轉搭浙贛火車安全抵此，决往××省歸隊，以繼續抗戰，他們說：『前年冬上，我軍自淞滬西栘後，遺留在上海和界上的傷兵，計有二萬左右，除了最少數失踪或病亡者外，其餘都已先後醫愈，分批遣送各戰區去了。但自動設法，就近加入京滬游擊隊的，爲數亦極可觀．常然囉，他們既在那一帶作戰掛彩，地形自特別熟習，今再加入原巳聲勢浩大的游擊隊去，不是吹牛的話，實是「爲虎添翼』，無怪把一般×軍和漢奸們弄得　然睡到半夜裏，還要常去摸摸腦袋是否搬了家？』</p>
<p>我們正說得津津有味的時候，突聞悠長宏曉的警報，這好像一隻警覺慈愛的母鷄，發現上空飛來兇殘無比的鷙鳥，便趕快呼叫庇護她天眞無邪的羣雛以的，把我們散在各處的人都一個個　進堅固的防空壕裏去了！</p>
<p>在　裏居然聽見「砰砰砰」的聲音六七吓，但解除警報出來看時，不過僅僅炸着月台上的一點鹽堆，和　外兩二間空民房，此外却把舊彈坑翻平了幾個，誠如鐵路上一個監工去査看時，操着河南口音說的：「×他姐！成天來炸株州算個啥！』意思是說，連勞駕來査看一下都是多餘的事了。</p>

<h3>日本的危險性</h3>
<p>— 保仁譯</p>
<p>紐約TNTERNATiONALPRESS</p>
<p>作者　J.H.ROBiNSON</p>
<p>要是我們少許能觀祭的話，誰都會知道中日整個生死對立的形勢已發生急烈的轉變。廣州，漢口相繼被日軍侵佔後，中國抗戰態度較前更爲堅决，這次血的戰爭，已引起中國民衆的怒吼；全國都能萬衆一心去愛護他們的國家，成千百萬的農民及靑年學生，在中國的指揮部指導之下，進行着行動戰及側面戰，這種藝術，他們已經有着大規模的訓練與組織，弄得日本在中國所佔領的土地內，失掉一切重要的意義，所以新土地的佔領，只更增加了日本在前方和後方的困難，使他對中國的侵略步驟，愈演愈慌，愈戰愈亂。在這裏我們且將日本的危險性及弱點，揭露出來。</p>
<p>日本戰時的危險性最大的莫若經濟方面，而在經濟方面最昭彰明顯的現象，就是日本國內輕工業和重工業間的矛盾，因受戰事關係而日益深刻化，這裏所調輕工業，即紡織，造紙，罐頭食品等等，其大部份可稱爲民需工業。所謂重工業，卽槍砲，水睦飛機等等，其大部份在日本國內，可稱爲軍需工業，日本近十年來，爲欲與列强國家競賽，實現其大陸政策的野心，故不能不加速發展其重工業，前次以武力侵佔華北之主要原因，也在於想奪取軍需製造原料。自一九三七年中日戰事發生後，日本需要該項原料更形急迫，不得不化大量的黃金，向外購買，輕工業因國內重工業之畸形發展而驟受打擊，一蹶不振，成江河日下之勢。</p>
<p>在林內閣時代，政府就積極　展軍需工業，故在這個時期，可稱爲備戰時期，到中日戰事發生後，漸漸改爲全戰時期，直到板垣陸相上台後，卽宣稱中日戰事恐須延長到十年，而東條次官多依據十二月二十日東京御前會議之意旨，更明言說日本急欲準備對付蘇聯，由以上諸點事實，我們可以知道，日本目前的局面實含有全戰和備戰二重性，因爲有這種原因，所以新近日×們的「國防軍需一口號，較前史加喧嘩，而其重工業之畸形發展，亦宛如盲人瞎馬，隨時有着崩潰的危險。從前廣田內閣時代，日本欲執行民生，軍備兩全的政策，竟遭失敗，林內閣抹殺民生而注重軍備，不過敷衍於一時，近衛內閣時雖能够藉口戰事關係，土繼續抹殺民生，但這個辦法絕非長久治安之計，新近近衛內閣及池田藏相辭職的主要原因，無非是反映日本經濟難關而已。</p>
<p>自瀋陽事變到　溝橋事件，短短六年內，日本民需工業之資本增加額由百份之六十五降至百份之三十八，同時期內日本軍需工業資本增加額反而由百份之三十五升爲百份之六十二，戰事發生後，日本當局更積極獎勵重工業之投資，一九三七年九月對重工業指定二十一億日金之私人投資，而在此項數額中，去年年底巳有　份之六十二投放在純粹軍需工業，至於日政府所撥用之戰費中，消耗於重工業原料的，至少有百分之三十，現政府規定戰費之額定數如下：一九三七年…二·五三〇：一九三八年…四·八五〇；一九三九年…五·〇〇〇（以百萬日金元作單位）</p>
<p>戰費額定以外，還有佔日政府預算百分之五十至六十的陸海軍兩省經常費、此項經常費之一部份。也投于純粹軍需工業中·</p>
<p>因爲軍需工業受政府鼓勵，同時被戰事所摧促，日本國內軍需工業之利潤總値也有着驚人的增加，據「日本評論』一九三八年十二月號所載之統計，一九三八年上半期較一九三七年上半期，各項軍需工業之利潤總値有百份之三十八之增加，其中製蔴業利潤額提高百份之四十八，製鞋業提高百分之四十三，金屬工業百分之四十二，化學工業百分之四十一，礦業利潤及機械業利潤各增加百分之三十四。</p>
<p>因為日本重工業畸形膨脹及輕工業逐漸沒落，弄得國內民不聊生，怨聲載道，人民鑒到軍×的侵略的暴行，及因戰事而受的苦痛，均厭惡戰爭，下面兩個表，就可以表現出日本戰時民衆生活的槪况、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>加強空戰力量</h3>
<p>我國沒有强大海軍，造成了數千里海岸悉遭封鎖的悲劇。然而我國經濟社會的特性，却能不受海岸悉被封鎖的威脅，而繼續支　畏期戰爭·</p>
<p>我國沒有巨大的大空戰鬥力，所以在抗戰十九個月以來，　然我們的少年空軍已經　建　驚世界的奇功，但是由於物質條件限制了空軍的充實與發展，不僅未能充分逹到協助陸軍擊退×軍，並且未能使後方民衆更少受些損失與犧牲，所以抗戰新階段，怎樣積極鞏固與增强天空戰鬥力，實在是全民族重大任務之一，</p>
<p>今據本報十二日重慶電，我國現正洽商增關中蘇中法直通航線，中英通航則至遲可於下月初實現。又據本港消息，我爲充實空軍，在美所購新式戰鬥機，短期內卽可運到。又傅法國朝野近日援華制日運動益　　烈，第一批航空人才十八名已在東來途中。這是多麽使人興奮的消息！</p>
<p>我國抗戰是與國際反法西反侵略運動是分不開的，特別是和英法美蘇各國當前的利害是完全一致的，現在×攻海南島事件爆發，更可證明此點。我們今日不僅要加緊保衞西南及西北大陸的國際交通綫，而且要趕快實現及增關與英法美蘇各民主國家的空中聯絡綫。而反對侵略的天空軍　互助工作，亦應　推進。我們希望國人　烈雜護政府增強空中戰鬥力的政策，而且要用行動來推進這種政策，</p>
<h3>斥承認西叛軍</h3>
<p>英法統治承認西班牙叛軍及其偽國民軍政府，據傅將成事實。</p>
<p>西班牙人民陣綫的民主共和政府，是全世界公認合法的政府；西叛軍及偽國民軍政府，是違反西班才全民公意及違反世界民主各國公意的德意侵略國家的工具。我們不知道這些準備承認西叛軍與偽國民軍政府的統治者，究將自處於何地？</p>
<p>不過這些統治者以其金融資本領袖的階級利益出發，本來已難責以公理正義！我們所要鄭重指出的，這些統治者在意德勢力下保持西班牙開發權益與轉移侵略者路向的幻想，只是一個惡夢，這个惡夢將使英法兩國陷於歐洲法西斯直接進攻之下，這个惡夢將使東方侵略者乘機推行其「遠東新秩序』與「太平洋爭覇戰』！這个惡夢更將使英法國內的反對運動日益普遍激化，而使這些統治者自食其果！</p>
<p>我們的任務，全世界正義前進人士與勞動大衆的任務，不是坐看這些統治者的自食其果，而是要加緊團結，統一，鞏固，發展我們自己的力景，用行動來喚醒這危害世界人類的惡夢，用行動來防制個這惡果的結成、</p>

<h3>建立「作者座談會」　文工作者聯合起來</h3>
<p>— 鐵光</p>
<p>本港文藝工作者現在已經像是雨後春筍蓬勃起來了·這些文藝工作者一方是由中國內地移植來的，一方又是本地所新生長成起來的·於內地的移植與本地所長成的文藝花菓的互相輝映底下，使本港的新文藝運動將獲得更結實的前途。」但這需要文藝工作者艱苦的努力。</p>
<p>最近，香港一部份前進的文藝工作者響應着重慶「文協」總會關於文化工作者團結的建議以來，隨着又有許多同志提供了許多切實的意見·於是本港文藝工作的團結問題，便從每個文藝工作者的心泉奔鳴起來了，不僅是心泉的奔鳴，而且有不少積極的，熱心的份子正在分頭活動着。活動的情形如何，現在雖然還沒有得到具體的報導，但是進行的步驟已順利的開展。客觀的條件既在成熟中，則這一文藝工作者的團結事業，沒有不成功的·</p>
<p>現在首先有一件値得向文藝工作者報導的事，就是一部份積極的文藝工作者經已着手　備組織「作者座談會」·這一「作者座談會」，將是推展新文藝運動的一個有力機構，將是在這文藝荒凉的孤島上開出一朶戰鬥的藝術之花·一希望大家集攏到這裏來，圍　在它的周遭·</p>
<p>『作者座談會』的組織職員，只要他是一個擁護抗戰，擁護團結的能够寫作的人，就可以够資格。無分有名無名，也無分老年靑年，更無分黨分派的作家。</p>
<p>『作者座談會』的中心任務，是研究寫作　論和技術，研究新形勢，新問題，充實每個作者的修養。同時嚴格批判及指摘一切有害抗戰的文化工作，認識及執行每一個新形勢，新問題的新任務，加緊各人的工作和自我批評，監視××　的文化陰謀，爭取本港的落後文人和讀者。此外，更和國內的文藝組織取得密切的　繋。而堅决的淸除「暍喝茶，談談大一的不正確的作風。</p>
<p>和祖國文藝抗戰　氣息要流通起來了，不久將會看到一作者座談會」表演出它所應盡的工作。</p>

<h3>舊陰謀的新花樣</h3>
<p>— 陳紹禹</p>
<p>在延安各界民眾抗日　　大會的演講</p>
<p>（一）汪精　是近　的傅聲筒</p>
<p>同志們！各界同胞們！</p>
<p>今天延安的五六千同胞　這裏開抗日　　大會！爲什麽我們大家把抗日和　　聯在一塊呢？因爲過去以親日派領袖　名的汪精　，現在公開的去根據最近中外各種通訊社的消息，在精衛瞞着國民黨中央執行委員會，瞞看國民政府，從重慶私自開小差逃走了·先逃到昆明，然後再從昆明逃到河內·在他初　走的幾天，恐怕中途被人拿獲，於是還裝腔作　地說什麽出國養病等等騙人的假話。但是，到了去年十二月三十日在省港發表了他十二月二十九致國民黨中央黨部電以後，汪精衞的　　、—完全暴露了！汪精衛在他致國民黨中央黨部的電報裏說些什麽呢？他就是把×相近衛去年十二月二十二日發表的所謂關於「中日兩國　整關係之基本政策』的謦明，　　　　　一樣重復了一遍；同時，他並公然無恥地說：國民政府應即以近衛聲明的原則作根據，與日本政府交換誠意，以期恢復和平·近衛聲明所講的中日兩國調整關係之基本政策的內容是什麽呢？就是所謂「本中日滿三國將來將以建立東亞　秩序，睦隣親善，共同反共及經濟台作爲共同目標』。而汪精衛向國民黨中央黨部的提議，却恰恰就是以」害隣，好，共同防共，經濟提携』二條原則作爲十日談判的根據。因爲汪精衛不過是近衛的傳聲商和應聲蟲，所以我們只要駁斥近衛聲明的狂妄，同時，也就完全駁　了汪精衛通電的　　，而駁斥近衛聲明的最完全最有力的文件，就是將委員長去年十二月廿六日在重慶總理紀念週上的訓話，蔣委員長這篇有歷史意義的訓詞，不僅將日×滅亡中國的各種陰謀揭露得體無完膚，而月也就預先把汪精　廿九日通電宣判了死刑。</p>
<p>（二）所謂東亞新秩序就是滅亡中國</p>
<p>請聽蔣委員長怎樣駁斥近衛關於所謂『建立東亞新秩序」的狂吠吧；蔣委員畏說：</p>
<p>「建立「東亞新秩序」，這是日本人最自命得意的口號和作法，照他的外相有出十二月十九日的解釋，「東亞新秩序云者，卽在一日，滿，支三國』政治，經濟，文化各方面之密切聯絡與互助，以阻止赤禍，擁護東洋文明，撤除經濟壁壘，而使中國說離半殖民地，以期東亞之安定』。而近衛在十四日之談話，亦謂：「中國事件之最終目的，不僅在軍事勝利，乃在於中國之新生與東亞之新秩序之確立、此項新秩序，係以中國新生後·日、滿，支三方面合作爲基礎。」大家要注意他所謂新生中國，是要消滅獨立的中國，外另生產一個奴隸的中國，世世受其支配；而　項新秩序，則是根據於中國巳變爲奴隷國家後，與日本及其造成之「滿洲僞國一緊密聯絡而成的。目的是什麽呢？以防止　禍的名義，控制中國的軍事，以擁　東洋文明的名義，消滅中國的民挨文化。以撤除經濟壁壘的名義，排斥歐笑勢力獨霸太平洋。再以一滿，日，支經濟單元』或「經濟集團」的工其、扼制中國經濟的命。大家試想，「建立束亞新秩序』那七個字之下包藏着怎樣的禍心。簡單一句話，這是推翻東亞的國際秩序，造成奴隷的中國，以遂其獨霸太平洋，宰割世界的企圖的總名稱」。</p>
<p>蔣委員長這段話完全對的。日×口裏講的和心裏想的所謂「東亞新秩序一，首先就是在滅亡中國，奴役中國基礎上　立起來的新秩序。</p>
<p>日×近衛所講的所謂「睦隣親善」和汪精衞所講的所謂『善隣友好』的內容是—麼呢？這就是汪精衞通電中所，特別得意洋洋地說的那一段：「日本對於中國無領土之要求，無賠償　費之要求，日本不但尊重中國之主權，且將仿明治維新前例，以允許內地居住營業之自由條件，交還租界，廢除治外法權，俾中國　完全其　立』。××的遭種騙人的陰謀和汪精衞的這　爲×巧辯的技倆，蔣委員長在其訓　中曾作了義正辭嚴的揭露。請聽蔣委員長怎樣駁斥××漢奸所謂日×對中　無領土要求，無事事賠償要求及交還租界和廢除治外法權等甘言狡計吧！蔣委員長說：</p>
<p>『在他的（即××的——作者附註）心目中，所謂領士，當然是他所支配的領土；資源也就是他義中的資源·旣然席捲以去，還要求什麽枝節的割地和始欵，他所要求的，旣在整個士地和人民，大欲在前，自然樂得以此不要領土，不要賠償的狡言欺世了·實際在我們中國的立場說，要　戰費賠　等等，當然首先要弄淸楚戰爭的責任所歸，這次明明　他發動兵力來到我們的領土內作戰，侵略責任灼然在人耳目·他這種說法，當然不値一顧·至於治外法　，如果　他掌握了，中國整個的主權，那更是皮毛上之皮毛。所調交還租界，也等於外　之奇，不但對其他國家的租界，他的與論已經鼓吹代爲管理，要收囘中國的租界，成爲日本獨有的大租界；而且實際說來中國若承認了他的「東亞新秩序』和「日，滿，支」協同關　，就是將中國全部領土，變成日本所有的大租界·這樣一來，中國若个是變成他的奴隷國，也要降爲保護國，而且實際上就是合併於日本，他說要使中國爲完全獨立國家，豈非就等於馬關條約中的朝鮮麽？」</p>
<p>（三）蔣委員長駁斥的　直氣壯</p>
<p>蔣委員長這段話完全對的·日×明明派乒佔領全中國領土，還無恥地說無領土野心！日×明明想佔領全中國資財，當然用不着談什麽賠欵！同時，的確蔣委員長說得對，如果講到賠欽的話，我們是要日×向我們賠償一切戰爭損失的，因爲　　×開，×人應負戰爭禍首的實任　　×旣然志在滅亡中國，把中國變成日本的殖民地，那裏還用得着什麽治外法權和什麼租界呢！對於××漢奸要求允許日人在中國內地有居住營業目由問題，蔣委員長允其駁斥得理直氣壯和精誠感人。蔣委員長說：</p>
<p>「此外，他更提出中國應　予日本臣民以內地居住營業之目由權，這一點看去似乎是很平凡，可　他沒有知道中國人對日本過去在華所造的罪惡，是留有怎樣一個深刻普遍的印象，老實說，中國老百姓一提到日本，就會聯想到它的特務機關和爲非作惡的浪人；就會　想到販鴉片，賣嗎啡，製造白麵，銷售海洛英，句賭包娼，私販軍械，接濟土匪，豢養流氓，製造漢奸，一切擾我秩序，收我民德·毒什匪化的陰謀，所以開放內地的居住和營業自由，在中國將來法政完全獨立以後，對其他國家不是不可以討論的；而對於日本，除非我國願意受其毒害和擾亂，除非我國願意放棄維待治安的權利，除非我們願意將我國的善良風紀　其敗壞，將我們的經濟膏血受其吮吸，就沒有人會應允的，日本人應該不會健忘，所謂內地居住營業自由，不就是和當年所誚東北商租權有同樣的性質嗎了當民國十八年的時候，它現在的外務大臣有田，以東亞局長的資格，奉它內閣總理　中之命來南京交涉，當時我們就堅决拒絕，不肯答應這個商租權的要求，寧使它拿軍事來　領我們的東北，而决不肯與它訂立這種禍國喪權的不平等的條約。爲甚麽？就爲的日本給我們的　象太可怕了，其居住所到之地，警察權，經濟權部要隨之喪失·日本人如果有居住營業自由，同地的中國人就要沒有自由，甚至不能立足，當時的商租權問題，猶不過是東北一隅局部的事情，我們尙且不能應允，現在它更擴而大之，及于我們的全領土，而且在所謂「東亞新秩序」的口號之下，試問我國民尙能有攷慮之餘地嗎？」</p>
<p>（四）所謂中日共同防共實際就是减華</p>
<p>日×和汪精衞所講的「共同防共』的內容是什麽呢！蔣委員長在他的訓詞中也作明白的掲露·請聽蔣委員長怎樣揭露××漢奸的所謂「共同防共』的陰　吧！蔣委員長說：</p>
<p>「我們可以說，它不過是要以共同防共的名義·首先控制我國的軍事，進而控制我國政治文化以至於外交·這一點便是七七抗戰以前，它歷次要求不遂而懷恨的一個主因·我們因爲不願上他的圈套，寧使忍受着十辛萬苦，到了最後關頭，寧可以舉國犧性來抗戰，如果遭個共同防共的要求可以應允，還待今日嗎？世上一般與論，或者以爲日本之所謂防共，其眞意在防蘇俄；實際日本所謂　結協定共同防共者，目的　在防共，也不在防　，而實在於作此名義以亡華，卽使有對俄的意　在內，也只佔一小部的成分，而其大部成分，則在於滅華。不然，它如果爲了國防或眞是對俄關係，那末，今年七八月間，當張　峯軍事衝突時，何以它的駐蘇大使重光葵，向　俄外長如此卑鄙却步而　後終於屈服，就可見它之對我國提出所謂防共云云，只不過外欺世論，內欺國民，而要向中國求得華北，內蒙駐兵的一個幌子罷了·老實說，如果華北駐兵可以允許，內蒙可以劃爲特區。我們也小會有七七的抗戰·』</p>
<p>蔣委員長這段話完全對的。日×漢奸的所謂中日共同防共，實際上就是要滅華，就是要把中國的軍事，政治，經濟，文化和外交完全拿在日×的控制之下，就是要使中國變成日本的奴隸國。同時，蔣委員長指出日×漢奸所謂防共的目的，『卽使有對俄的意味在內·也只佔一小部的成分，而具大部成分則在於滅華·」蔣委員長這一指示，不僅澈底掲破了日×共同防共的假面具，而且也給了那些狂呼亂叫一中國抗戰是替蘇聯打仗」的糊塗　或別有心肝的搗亂抗戰的份子以當頭的棒喝。</p>
<p>（五）所謂中日經濟提擕就是日滿</p>
<p>經濟合作的重演</p>
<p>最後，日×和汪精衛所講的「經濟提　』或「經濟合作』的內容是什麽呢？蔣委員長在他的訓詞中也作了明白的　露。請聽蔣委員長怎樣掲露××漢奸的所謂「經濟　携』或「經濟合作」的　謀吧！蔣委員長說：</p>
<p>「所謂一經濟單元』和『經濟集團』，遭在日本倡導多年了，最近此　依然　行，而且也猛力進行，這是」東亞協回體』中間的主要環節·他們隨時改　着口號，有時稱經濟提携，有時稱經濟合作，而其政府十一月四日宣言，則　爲「經濟聯系」·十一月底的×國報紙，載　「日滿支將成立；濟單位，今後將禍福與共』；接着十二月十九日，有田說話中有這樣一句話：『日本决定開經濟會議，以謀日滿支經　密切的結合，而强化「經濟單元一·此類經濟關係，世人稱謂「經濟集團』，在事實上，他們作爲經濟吞倂工具的「華北開發』和「華中振與』兩公司，早巳成立了。日滿支經濟懇談，開了不止一次了·其所謂企劃院，也於近　發　聲明之第二天，作成「日滿支生產力理擴充計劃案』了。他遭個所謂經濟集團，不僅是要操縱我中國關稅金融，壟斷我全國生產和貿易，獨佔　亞的霸權，逐漸推演下去，勢必至於限制我們中國個　人民的衣食住行都得不到一些自由，生殺予奪，唯其所欲，整個的使中國民族做奴隷，做牛馬，在鞭笞　吮之下整個消滅我們民族的生存·』</p>
<p>蔣委員長這段話完全對的。日×漢奸所謂中日的『經濟提携」或「經濟合作」的實際內容，就是日×巳　實行的所謂「日　經濟合作」和『日滿經濟合作』的重演。土地，森林，礦山，銀行，鐵路，海關，稅收，工廠爲日×所佔有和受日×所支配·內外商業受日×所壟斷，人民生活陷於水深人熱和牛馬奴隸的慘狀，這就是日×口裏　的，心裏想的和在朝鮮，台灣以及我東北　省及一切淪陷區域裏手裏做的眞實情形。</p>
<p>（六）在抗戰緊急之際傅播　背國</p>
<p>策之谬論</p>
<p>正因為近衛　明，真實內容是這樣陰險惡毒，所以蔣委員長在他的訓詞中把近衛聲明估計成「是×人整個的吞滅中國獨霸東亞進而企圖征服世界的一切狂妄陰謀的　自白，也是×人整個亡我國家滅我民族的一切計劃內容的暴露』。而汪精衞在開小差以後，居然把近衞聲明一部分直抄，一部分改裝巧扮，作爲自己向國民黨中央黨部的建　。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　·國民黨中央執監委員會因此决定永還開除汪兆銘的黨籍亞撤除具一切職務，這是絕對正確的·請聽中國國民黨開除汪精衛黨籍决議全文中的重要的一段：</p>
<p>『汪兆鉻承本黨付託之重，値抗戰緊急之際，擅離戰守，匿跡異地，傳播遠背國策之謬論。　日來電，竟主張以×相近衛根本滅亡我國之狂悍聲明爲根據，而向×求和·一面騰之報章廣爲散發，以建議中央爲名，逞搖惑人心之技·而其電文內容，尤處處爲×要求曲意文飾，不惜顚倒是非，爲×張目，更復變本加厲，助其欺蒙　，就此行爲而言，純爲通×求降，充其影響所及，直欲撼　國本·我國爲救亡圖存，而發動抗戰，百餘萬將十之死傷，數百萬同陶之犧牲，慘痛深切，無非欲根本消滅×人侵略之毒計，以永保我國家民族世代永久之生命，年餘以來，國民則精誠團結，將士則踴躍用命，萬衆一心，咸集中於本黨總裁蔣委員長領導之下，堅毅　屈，有必可勝利之自信，今×人謀我之野心益彰，技倆益毒，卽吾全國之敵愾愈切，决心愈　·汪之所言，不僅爲中央所痛絕，實亦爲全國民衆所不容。查戰爭期間，任何國民絕對不得遠反戰時國策之决定而自定主張，本黨記律，更絕對不允許逾　黨的正式决議，違反黨的規則，而以個人發表其意見。汪兆銘此種行動·其爲違反紀律·危害黨國，實已昭然若揭，大義所在，斷難姑息，即予以永遠開除黨籟，並撤除一切職務，藉肅黨紀，以正視聽。……』</p>
<p>我可以完全有把握的說：不僅今天到會的幾千民衆，不僅全延安的各界同胞，不僅全陜甘寧邊區的將近百萬的民衆，而且不　全中國四萬萬同胞，就是全世界一切主張正義的人士，那熱烈擁　將委員長駁斥近衛聲明的演講，部一致擁護中國國民黨永遠開除汪精衛黨籍的　議，從去年十二月二十九日的通電發表以後，汪精衛從親日派領袖的地位、衛不僅永遠沒有資格作國民黨黨員，而且永遠沒有資格作中華民國的國民！因此，我們不僅激烈地擁護國民黨開除汪精衛黨籍的决議，而且願意看到國民政　開除汪精衛國籍的明令。因此，陳誠，李宗仁，白崇禧，稈潘，衛立煌，張發奎，余漢謀，薜岳，李漢魂，鄧錫侯，潘文華，龍靈等前綫將領要求明令通緝汪精衛的通電，各地方政府和國內外國民黨黨部要求以國法懲處汪精衛的提議，一定能得到今天到會同胞和全國人民的響應和擁護·</p>
<p>（七）汪精衛媚×投降的行為不是</p>
<p>偶然的</p>
<p>同志們；各界固們！</p>
<p>經濟欄</p>
<h3>英鎊革命及其影響</h3>
<p>倫敦是世界金市場的首都、又是國際金融的中心、這種優　地位、在平昔、固然造成了英鎊在世界貨幣市塲上的領袖資格、現在可變成踐踏英鎊的主要因素之一、因爲世界金價、旣因各國備戰的激漲、英鎊却被匯傘拉住而不能跟起、這不啻就變成英鎊對內價値的跌落、加以英國國庫、近年巳由盈餘變成虧空、對外留易和國際收支、又都發主逆差、英鎊對外價　、本身也軟弱得利害、怎再經得起金價漲風給他的這種壓迫、</p>
<p>最近英國財長西門、已向國會要求、實行重估英格蘭銀行的　備價値、並决定每週依市價估定一次、由估價而發生的收益、用作外匯基金，至於該行的紙幣發打額、則要求由四萬萬鎊减至三萬萬　、並以此爲定數、不予增减、</p>
<p>這個辦法、在英國幣制上實是一次很大的革命、英格蘭銀行的準備金、向依法定價每盎斯八十五先令計算、且巳有二百多年的歷史、從未變更、現在非特放棄這法定價、而且每週依市價估定一次、因此金價愈漲、也就是英國凖備金或外匯基金的價値愈大、常然可使英鎊的地位、更堅固起來、倫敦泰晤士報稱此辦法為「市價金本位」、勢將成爲現代貨幣學上的一個簇新的名詞、</p>
<p>再者、英格蘭銀行的紙幣發行額、向跟現金準　的多少而增　、如果依市價估定凖備金額、在金價續漲的今日、紙幣發行　必有增大可能、紙幣增大，金價當然會受通貨增加的影響而上昇、所以現在决定紙幣發行總額、不得超過二萬萬鎊、於是發行總額巳成定數、而發行凖備額、、反因　價而視紙幣發行額爲轉移、與前適得其反，這眞是英鎊的新革命、</p>
<p>這次革命、對於今後的金價和　匯、將起什麽影響、以我們的見解、大致可使飛漲中　金價、和軟弱中的鎊匯、都得站穏一時、</p>
<p>因爲英　蘭銀行的紙幣發行現减至三萬萬、首先可得收縮通貨之利、使英　為堅、金價被東、又因重估而直接加强外匯基金、間接增强英國的財政信　、英鎊地位、自然可望提高、於是可使懷疑英鎊而爭購黃金的人因以减少、那末令市的投機熱度、當然也可下减、因而倫敦　金市場、其勢當可暫穩時定了、</p>

<h3>聖約瑟此綿綿　被警察淘汰出局　四比三警察勝得銀牌決賽權　乙組葛以七比二淘汰工務局</h3>
<p>【本　專訊】昨天球城與、甲組足球祗有警察會對聖約瑟那齣特別銀牌獨幕　、乃在海軍塲開演、中西看客數百、塲面還不算冷寂、兩軍經九十分鐘　競爭、尙成三比三之局、勝負未判、那戰神乃延長二十分鐘的逗留、給個最後機會、由兩軍算淸這　球賬、結果、警察憑賴　六分幸運、四分人事、在加時比賽而將完場的煞那間、竟由那位原是表演最壞的磨士、出人意料地開來　有價値的一脚、踢斷約瑟的壽命、以四比三完成此次勝利、奪得决賽權、一般有客、初都以爲約瑟不會失敗的、豈知事實適得其反、乃有如此收塲、</p>
<p>約瑟　敗原因、非關個人技術、其中有什麽缺點比不上警察而致應該吃　、最致命傷則在下半峙其佔三比二優勢的時候、夏　足　受創、退出而復入、行動不靈、勉强應戰、迫得　中堅之職、改充石翼、思馬葵士調　右內錄　於那位被警察視為最危險　子的大吿山奴、　時　支持己方的重要據點、乃很作中堅、替代夏仙、然　前線的進攻力、　巳因此調動而削弱了、比路度因病缺席、亦是憾事、如其參戰、或不致迺此變故、惟成敗之數、那關係不單在　人參戰與否的身上、加　敗於那實力原不及　方的警察、則具中原因、當然複雜、而警察各員愈戰愈勇、允足使損兵折將的約瑟陷於苦戰中、士氣受相當打擊、不得不棄城而走、</p>
<p>約　在前次複賽、得大吿山奴、比路度、雷米迪等　力、陣容一新、乃將不可一世的海軍淘汰出局、晉陞一級、氣吞斗牛、滿以為到準决賽時一鼓而擒警察、他日可望染指錦標了、怎曉得人算不如天算、竟遭警察所敗、中途而廢、前功盡棄、此恨綿綿、向　訴說、抑亦足見此項錦標、有非盡靠人　便可奪得的、人力以外、還須視運道如何、</p>
<p>警察所勝四　、半是機會造成、如第二球是十二碼自由踢、第四球是磨　射時因馬葵士視綫　而得以中鵠、故其刻下半個錦標到手的是幸運、蓋以其實力而論、甚是平凡、昨天得以渡過難關、已不知幾住修到、惟非冠軍福相、望之不似、他日與　華南對東方之得勝者爭標、敢斷盟主一席、非其所有、</p>
<p>在比役中、警察陣　三位華員、都有很好的貢獻、與西員比較、出色多多、左內衞陳光格、脚頭够勁、防禦　、大吿山奴幾次碰着他、趦趄不前、黃文　在下半時至多　作、帕尼拉與蘇沙、屢次受　脅威、頗覺頭痛、范貴才亦不錯、西員中以帕架、舉力　爲好、侯律磨士　無善足陳、但二氏均有所獲、　功固不可歿、總之、警察能够得　、幸運成份居　、</p>
<p>乙組銀牌　决賽、士葛以七比五淘汰工務局、士葛　與米杜　同得决　權、甲組一役情形、貉紀如下、</p>

<p>亞路域士　金氏　李安納　大吿山奴　思馬矣士</p>
<p>戰端一啓、警察即取攻勢、范貴才侯律先後逞威、均　麥哈地接出、然約瑟隨之兩次犯門、雖未能破關、警察守將已吃驚不少了、</p>
<p>戰後十分鐘、黃文貴得球沿邊疾進、深入腹地、再交范　才、池一射　入、先開紀錄、嗣後警察因左翼磨士表演失常、屢失應勝機會</p>
<p>已而約瑟前鋒、大肆活動、金氏帶球追攻、被麥哈　　出、負一角球、思馬葵士開來落點極佳、大吿山奴以頭迎球、疾如流矢、遂以一對一反敗爲和、</p>
<p>約瑟自勝囘一球後、聲勢煊赫一時、大吿山奴李安納如蝶穿花、屢千警察以威脅、而雷米迪鞏固後方、有若金湯、反觀警察中綫、巳露軟弱、左翼　士、更爲失色、侯律、范貴才、黃文貴、又無用武之機、巳而、警察兩衞糾纏李安納、令不防亞路域士斜來一射、應聲入網、約瑟遂以二比一反勝、再戰片時、上半場終吿、</p>
<p>易地而戰、警察之黃文貴、　芒　露、兼以侯雜强　　刺、約瑟門前、又吿多事、還　雷米迪守土有方、不爲所算、有頃　律迎頭頂球、雷米迪趕上爭取、侯律被阻仆地、約瑟遂被罰—二碼自由　、由摩士主踢、一舉而入、　此雙方又以二比二再造和局、</p>
<p>七分鐘後、約瑟得角球之利、思馬葵士吊交中點、金氏就近射進、約瑟又以三比一勝、警察負後、冉接冉勵、黃文貴單人匹馬、不迭衝過對方　後防線、可惜范貴才侯律被纏、沒人接應、正在此時、夏仙足部受傷、出而復入、陣綫略爲　動、一攻一守、因而感受影響、不久、黃文言又逼退蘇沙、把球切中、侯律乘勢踢進、又以三比三　、此後、　瑟前　、咸抱破斧沉舟之念、李安納、大吿山奴、亞路域士、明攻　　、弄到警察腹地、險象環生、幸陳光裕大刀闊斧、力戰來將、化險爲夷、直至塲終、勝負仍未分、裁判員乃延長比賽時間二十分、</p>
<p>再戰後、夏仙與思馬葵士曾兩度迫門、但均爲麥哈地救出、迫至最後兩分鐘、侯律帶對球疾進、雷米迪竟然失足、侯律冉傳中綫、磨士近射、馬思葵士視綫被阻、看不準球的來勢、撲一個空、挽救不及、而約瑟的不幸命運、由此注定了、結果警察以四比三高唱凱旋歌、</p>

<p>內容是叙述一個鄉下女郎到大城市、找　未婚夫、大鬧笑話、後來還怎樣的和一個作家及此作家莠作的　行人、在特　的形境之　、發生了一段　狂胡閙的戀愛故事、</p>
<p>本片抓住了現代都市生活之一片段加以發揮、表現得非常明快、導演RichardThorpe對於喜劇的處　理、極豐富的經驗、不但把全片勾劇了一個諧極無比的風格、同時　一鏡頭、也都充滿濃厚的詼諧的情趣、每一寸膠片的放映、都使觀衆沒有停笑的機會、　納姬娜在片中演飾村姑、表現出一種極可愛的性格、她把一　　下女子純潔　平的衷　、和對都市朋友　甚信任的態度、刻劃得維妙維肖、是片中最出色的人物、餘如分　作家與發行家之雜拔孟甘穆利和法蘭曹通、也有極美妙優秀的　作、此部影片、可說是他們三星第一次的合作與成功的作品、</p>
<p>皇后……良醫　愛</p>
<p>A　Man　To　Remnerber</p>
<p>對於喜歡有優美故事的影片的　衆、本片是最合理想的作品、片中　寫一個鄕村醫生的一生失敗與成功的哀榮史、利用追述的方式、開展各個塲面、叙述那醫生怎樣廿年如一日的、一本犧牲的精神爲社會爲貧苦的大衆服務、同時片中也毫不含糊的暴露社會上小人之輩自私自和的醜態、</p>
<p>愛華愛和士在片中　一位無學位而却抱有極大的能耐、優秀的大才的醫生、懷着爲人　般務的心同志、携幼子囘到家鄕、可是敢信任他的只是一些貧苦的農民、他所得的報酬、也只是一些農產品、在某一次出診的收獲、却是他剛代人家接生下來的女嬰兒、他就這樣毫不灰心的奮鬥下去、敎育兄子得到很高的學位、可是令他失望的是這兒子只追求着虛譽與金錢、幸虧有那養女作他唯一帮助與安慰、　了還本他先見之明、拯救了全村孩子脫離一種危險的傳染症、才得到全村熱誠的敬仰與愛戴、</p>

<p>片子很長、但是因？導演的手法高妙、調子始終輕快流利、使人並不覺得其中有鬆懈之處、文舉作品改　爲電影、這一片可算上上之作、</p>
<p>有飾祖母的梅維勃遜、也是　得一提的、雖則戲少很、</p>

<p>全劇自始至終、散漫異常、劇情全無中心點、我相信進步的觀衆、必不會歡迎這樣的片子、唱的曲還是幾支舊曲、</p>
<p>太平……王氏四俠</p>
<p>國片</p>
<p>由　片改成聲片、由單色染上彩色、物質上這張重攝的片于是進步多多了、男主　是王引、女主角却是個新　張　　、塲面偉大、是其進步處、</p>

<h3>幻術家</h3>
<p>— 璇冰</p>
<p>記得在戲院裏，或在某一個會塲上，看見過不少在舞台上穿上奇異的服裝，親上一副詼諧的面孔，在拿着一塊布，一套『撲克』牌的人，向一般人表演他的幻術的玩弄，從一塊布變出紙煙，從這套『撲克』牌的這一張變成別一張；千變萬化的層出不窮，似乎他就是一個萬能的神仙似的，要這個，就有這個，要那個，就有那個。</p>
<p>但是有些幻術家們大槪因台下的觀衆明知他所表演的是假的吧，在未表演他的『神通』之前說幾句開場白，謂「看得見，你眼快。看不見，我手快。」這類自認他的幻變是假的，是騙人的，自然聽了這幾句話的觀衆，就是最愚魯不過的人，也知他所玩弄的非眞乃幻，但有些幻術家他偏要賣弄「神通」似的，不但不說他所要弄演的是假，就連包含他所要表演的技術的意義的名稱—幻術—這個幻字也故神其說的來一套騙人的解釋。</p>
<p>這自然騙不了有自信力，意識堅强的人，然對一般意識搖動不定，信仰脆弱的入就會上其大當了。</p>
<p>當我在遇到這個塲合的時候，他的解釋自然騙不了我，但，我看看前後左右的人，『上當』的也不少，而且「上當』的人不一定是婦孺，就是衣冠楚楚，外表看來似是名流學者的也領首默許其說，在他的表演後，還大加贊嘆不已，說，這樣表演那裏還會是假的。這件東西，從那裏來的呢，這塊布能躱藏這麼多東西嗎？』這一類自欺欺人，　信這些表演，一定是眞的的話。</p>
<p>座位接近這些被騙還不自知的我，接受了這麼多發笑的資枓，除了與友人相視發一個會心的微笑外，而且看完這場劇的歸途中，在無聊的時候，還會引爲談話的資料，大發議論！</p>
<p>但，當我靜坐無聊，偶然想起這事情時，除了覺得一羣傻子被騙得可憐外，還會再更進一步；覺得人生世上，所接觸到一切事物大多是，『近乎此』，小如個人生活所接觸得到的社會之一角，大如國際政治上的錯綜變化，莫不皆然，不過的他們所表演的手段高明一點，面孔上做作莊重一點而已。</p>
<p>如現在這年個年頭，就是幻術家緊鑼密鼓大顯神通的時候，有些在這座高樓大廈中今天幻出一張協定的約文，明天又幻出一套廢協的勾當，得了便宜就笑臉迎人，要求不遂，便拍案為人，這些做作不外是鈎心鬥角賺利營私的手叚，也就是幻術在表演着而已。</p>
<p>遠的不說，別的也暫置不談，拿我們的東鄰前數月表演過一齣『拿手好戲』來講，首相親自登台變手拿着一張太陽旗，一搖一揚，就笑容可鞠的幻出一張寫了和平幸福字眼的宣言，引得敝國衣冠楚楚的名人之流的一羣拍手稱奇，信以爲眞，來一個響應，鬧得風雨滿城。然而環境一轉，時日一遷，當時的表演者下台了，換來一個又是和以前的他位一樣的主和者；他說以前這位主演和平宣言的先生是舞台上的玩弄而已，舞台上的東西，下了台就會不存在的了，說了這幾句開場白後，他又要開始主演她的「拿手』好戲了。</p>
<p>這一來，只把給人騙了還說是眞的，意志不堅，信仰薄弱的人一個最大打撃而巳。</p>
<h3>年關</h3>
<p>— 震楓</p>
<p>爬呀爬。跟隨着日子拚命地爬，爬呀爬，爬到了年關，啊，年關難道就是一個難關？</p>
<p>年關就是一萬條鐵鞭，出盡了「法寶』莫說容易捱過！艱難苦痛的事情永速緊纏着無吿的寫人老婆嚷着嘴向丈夫討錢，不曉事的孩子扭着爸爸要做新衫怎知道爲難了做男人的不講情的房東因爲一到年關，不體諒人家還加了人家的房租，並惡狠狠地索着舊欠！</p>
<p>爬呀爬，吃够了苦頭還得爬，爬呀爬，爬來爬去仍然是山脚下，爬到了年關，不，爬到了難關，啊爬到了難關啦！</p>
<h3>戰爭與和平</h3>
<p>— 友狄</p>
<p>和平，和平，現在有人蒙着　和平的外衣，遮掩他們叛變的眞臉——然而他們終不能汚損了和平這聖潔的花朶的。</p>
<p>漢奸主和論者開口便說：『難道有不和的戰嗎？』不錯的，和平就是戰爭的終結。戰爭是流血的政治，政治是不流血的戰爭。戰爭了結，和平重現。可以說和平是戰爭的否定；而戰爭的「量變』到「質變」，也就是戰爭到和平的全過程。但是和平却並非漢奸主和論者之隨便尋求的！</p>
<p>戰爭達到一定的階段，和平必然地來臨的。這個時候，就是交戰集團的一面巳經以武力把它的政治目的完全達成，而另一面是失敗了，理由是：戰爭是兩隻團的政治的（　經濟的）矛盾的尖說衝突，這矛盾表現于特殊的政治形式（武力）來課它的解消，這矛盾的解消便是和平的到臨。</p>
<p>我們此次抗戰的政治目的，在于驅逐民族敵人，爭取民族解放，建立一民主共和國」。而×人進行侵略戰的政治目的在于獨佔，奴役中國，使中國完全殖民地化，這政治上（經濟上）的矛盾引惹了戰爭，這戰爭的展望是：我們以全民族的力量驅敵全鴨綠江邊，達到了這政治的目的之後，和平便來臨！但若是需要的話，我們打算援助朝鮮的革命運動，而戰爭的結果必引起日本民衆的革命，那麽中國抗戰是爭取眞正和平。</p>
<p>明白了這個和平的　釋，一切漢奸主和論的說法是無法存在了！漢奸主和論者是無選擇的求和平，他在現在就要求和平，請問我們可能達成我們的政治目的嗎！不！一萬個不，他們不但以爲恢復七七事變前的狀態便可以和乎，而且還以這是徒然的高調，但他們的說法是替×人計劃的，因爲敵人的政治目的便可以通過這些漢奸主和論者的手，能够順利的達到了！</p>
<p>因此，假如有人問，『戰爭幾時才了結呢，和平幾時才降臨呢，』我們應該立即回答他，我們停止戰爭只要達到民族解放，建立「民主共和國」這政治目的，具體地說，是把敵人驅到鴨綠江邊，漢奸主和論者說，『要打到東京去才是和平』這是騙孩子也騙不來的屁話！</p>
<h3>牛欄之夜</h3>
<p>— 彭成慧</p>
<p>夜靜着，什麽也靜着。</p>
<p>在這窮鄉僻壤的小村落裏，只要天空一黑，家家戶戶就閉門了。田圍曠野之間，什麽也靜悄悄地在夜中休息着。現在是冬天，日子很短，天空特別容易黑，因爲沒有月亮和星光，天氣又塞，外面就格外顯得荒凉了。</p>
<p>村舍外邊有許多燒着牛糞，垃圾，以及禾　之類的火堆，吐着難聞的氣息，冒起濃密的黑烟，火光時時在暗中閃耀，有時還夾着一二聲尖銳的，輕微的爆炸。</p>
<p>對面山脚的鄰村。不時傳來幾聲沉沉的狗吠。茅舍櫛比的窗　裏，時明時滅地漏着　小的燈光。時間雖則還早，却到處都是一片沉靜和荒眞。自從惠州失陷以後，土匪乘掛出沒，這裏的人家更早關門，炊烟一起，路上就很少行人了。</p>
<p>在這小村的邊緣，有着一間泥磚結的小屋，頂面全是用茅草蓋的，門前矗立着一株古老的龍眼樹，下面零亂地擺着幾條石枝凳。這小屋是座水牛歇宿的牛欄，此時正有三個看牛的小孩，擁着一張黑硬的破被，共一頭的躺在一張占舊的床上。二條高大的水牛，躺在黑暗的角落，索案吃着乾草。</p>
<p>他們此時很興奮，做着美麗的夢，幻想着飛鵝嶺上的世界。明天，是的明天。他們就可以參加他們的活動了。大惡從前線歸來，曾經吿訴過他們，游擊隊是多麼的有趣。在山嶺重疊中，畫伏夜出，迂廻側擊，神出鬼沒，時時可以搶到×人許多軍用的東西：有望遠競，皮大衣，還有銅帽，皮靴和槍枝。黑夜裏荷着實彈，叱着口令，是多麼的雄壯。早晚吹着軍號閒時唱着救亡歌曲又是多麽的高興。他們也曾聽過學堂裏的先生講述過趙老太太部下有許多年輕戰士的故事。『小英雄』的影子，不時在他們腦中閃動。他們是鄉中三個最頑皮的小孩，平時就很喜歡玩土打毛瑟，現在有機會弄機關槍，盒子敵，你想他們怎不神往！</p>
<p>「明天道個時候，我們豈不是睡在飛鵝嶺的山　事』！較小的一個老是憧憬着明晚的情景。</p>
<p>「這麽好！你以爲還是跟上山看牛時一樣瀟灑嗎？當兵就時時都得打仗啦」！到底較大的一個想得細心一點。</p>
<p>『你們宅是做着這樣的夢，他們肯不肯收留我們，還是一個問題哩』！還是那個最大的想事最爲周到。</p>
<p>『不收留，沒有這個道理吧』！較小的懷着自信。</p>
<p>『對啦！學堂裏的先生不是對我們說過去做游擊一大小都收留麽』！較大的隊個也覺得很有把握。</p>
<p>『哈哈，盒子砲，機關槍，明晚就有得玩了』。較小的幾乎快樂得忘形，伸手在在邊較大的大腿上捏了一下。</p>
<p>『玩，玩，玩，恐怕一聽見×人的大砲聲，會嚇得你屎尿直流哩』！較大的向他訕美了一聲。</p>
<p>『人細胞不細，將來你看我殺鬼子時，你就曉得小弟的本領了』。他還是很得意誇耀着自己。</p>
<p>「喂，還是早點睡吧，明天一早我們須得趕路哩！」較大的正經地提出這個意見。</p>
<p>「好睡覺！」較小的很贊成。用力把被頭一拉，三個頭就縮在被頭裏面。</p>
<p>他們雖則决意睡覺，可是在被窩裏，還是你一句我一句的傾談着。睡神似乎到處逃避他們，而美麗的幻夢，也老是在他們的腦膜上跳躍。外面的夜更靜了，連斷續的狗吠聲也沒有。世界的一切，彷彿都在黑夜的甜睡中。最後，他們終於溜進了甜蜜的睡鄉。</p>
<p>第二天早上，陽光很燦爛的照耀着這個小小的村落。當三個看牛小孩，荷着包袱，向前往飛鵝嶺的山徑上邁進時，這個小村落正發生着孩子失踪的騷動。</p>
<h3>「成都的詩作者座談會」</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>成都文壇動態之一</p>
<p>那大約是去年七月間的事情了。</p>
<p>自從抗戰爆發後，降續來到成都的詩作者，巳經有了好幾個，再加上本來就住在當地的比較有寫作歷史的幾位，就全少也有了二十人以上。</p>
<p>不過，人儘管不少；但，直到那時候爲止，彼此是不大來柱的，組織什麼團體更談不到。</p>
<p>然而，這種情形能够讓它繼續下去嗎？回答當然是否定的。于是，由於幾個朋友的發動和奔走的結果，此間唯一的詩作者團體——新詩歌社——終於在七月間正式宣吿成立。</p>
<p>接着，我們就連續地開了幾次會，討論了許多詩歌上的問題，還定下了不少的工作計劃。</p>
<p>對於現階段詩歌的諸問題，雖然在同人之間，在過去，甚至有好些人的作風和見解是完全不同的；但，在目前，在使詩歌服務于抗戰的總目標之下，大家的意見可以說巳經沒有什麽衝突和矛盾的地方。</p>
<p>但，說到工作方面，則眞是說來也使人慚愧，我們不但沒有把預定要做的工作做起來，而且，不久，甚至於團體本身也陷進了　常鬆懈和渙散的狀態，</p>
<p>這原因，從現在囘顧起來，大槪有兩種：</p>
<p>第一，最初，我們是打算出版一種詩刊的，但，由於種種原因，終未實現，這，很減低了許多同人的與趣和對于團體的關心。</p>
<p>第二，有一部分的同人走散了。如下之琳，何其芳等之赴陜北，都在有形無形中影響到團體活動的主觀力量。</p>
<p>然而，這種情况，能够讓它永遠持續下去嗎？囘答仍然是否定的。</p>
<p>于是，在不久之前，這團體終于又把旗鼓重振起來了。——實行改組，幷由于種種原因，把團體的名稱改成了『詩作者座談會』。</p>
<p>目前，還一座談會，巳經以嶄新的姿態和作風出現在此間文藝界，開始了突擊的工作。</p>
<p>首先，我們就開始廣泛地徽求會員，廣泛地把組織發展到各階層的大衆裏面去。將沐，成名詩人不過是我們的團體組成之一小部份，而最主要的組成份子，將是一般才開始寫詩不久，或正在開始，甚至子祗是關于詩歌具着異常濃厚興趣的年輕人。因爲我們認爲：這種做法，在「此時此地」，乃是完全必要的；而且，也祗有這樣，　得眞正使新詩運動廣泛地展開，而打下大衆化的基礎。</p>
<p>關于工作方面，目前正在進行着的，計有下列數項：</p>
<p>第一，舉行詩歌晚會或朗誦會……巳决定于最短期間舉行一次。</p>
<p>第二，出刊物…座談會巳着手替此間的跋涉書店，編一種單行本化的詩刊物（有類于戰前在上海出版的『開拓者』）。這刊物，將于廢曆元旦後出版。第一本，除當地詩作者的作品外，還包括着昆明，重慶及其他地方的作者的作品，除此以外外還準備在當地的報紙上附出副刊一種（大約是週刊性質）。</p>
<p>第三，我們還準備經常派人到各學校，各團體，各種集會，去作詩歌有關的演講。</p>
<p>現刻，最努力爲團體工作的，計有鄧均吾，曹葆華，方敬，葉菲洛，…諸人。</p>
<p>總之，這一詩歌團體，雖然目前還很小，而且，還止在開始工作；但，它對于後方的詩歌運動，對于抗戰詩歌的建設工作，都將要祖負起它所待担負的任務來！</p>
<p>（一九三九，二月于成都）</p>

<h3>The Political Implications of the Japanese Invasion of Hainan Island</h3>
<p>In recent months, rumors have spread in society that Japanese spies have begun infiltrating the Hainan Island area. Those who are paying attention to the Sino-Japanese war situation have asserted that Japan will soon attempt to invade the island. It is generally understood that before any military action, Japan first establishes a network of spies, and at the same time, espionage work becomes particularly active. Sure enough, the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island at dawn on the tenth. Japanese militarists attempted to invade Hainan Island once before in June of last year, but the British and French governments jointly issued a serious protest. At the same time, France deployed a substantial fleet to stand guard. Japan, recognizing that the international situation was unfavorable to it, temporarily retreated in the face of difficulties. When the German-Czech crisis was at its most severe last September, it also concentrated its fleet, attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to invade. However, with the conclusion of the Munich Agreement, the European war was 'quelled' invisibly, and its conspiracy was therefore not realized. But why did it dare to rashly invade this time? Our observations suggest that its functions and reasons include the following points:</p>
<p>First, after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese army, on the one hand, was weakened by its troop strength, and on the other hand, was busy replenishing and reorganizing. For these past three months, military operations have been almost at a standstill. Recently, although there have been attempts to attack the Northwest to cut off the Sino-Soviet international route, and to attack Beihai, invading Nanning, and severing the Guangxi-Vietnam transportation lines, our side had made thorough arrangements in advance, and their cunning plan ultimately failed. Now is the time for the opening of the 74th session of the Japanese Diet. For nineteen months, the Japanese army's invasion of China has been unsuccessful, its finances are on the verge of bankruptcy, and its diplomacy is trapped in a situation of being besieged on all sides. The end of the war is nowhere in sight, and at present, it is truly a case of "unable to fight on, but unable to stop." The Japanese people feel extremely frightened and anxious, gradually moving from the stage of war-weariness to the stage of anti-war sentiment. The intensification of the revolutionary crisis deepens day by day. For example, recently, anti-war actions by Japanese soldiers on various battlefields have gradually become more active. In this session of the Diet, Seiyukai party member Kono and others have launched fierce attacks against the Hiranuma Cabinet, even openly criticizing the "Hiranuma Cabinet supported by military fascism as the most unpopular cabinet in Japanese history." All of this indicates that the Japanese people have lost confidence in the war, and the military government is on the verge of collapse. Under these circumstances, the Japanese military's proposed huge budget of 725 million yen for this year will inevitably provoke fierce debate in the Diet, which is difficult, there is no doubt. Therefore, the Japanese militarists had to seize this opportunity to create a new incident, on the one hand, to stimulate their demoralized national spirit, and on the other hand, to make it easier for the military budget to be passed in the Diet. This is one of the reasons why they invaded Hainan Island. In particular, the navy, since the July 7th Incident, has repeatedly advocated southward invasion in order to overshadow the army's achievements. In addition, this year's naval budget is only one-third of the army's. In order to increase the budget, the navy is even more impatient and proactive than the army in invading Hainan Island.</p>
<p>Second, strategically, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island can control Hong Kong, threaten French Indochina, Singapore, and the Philippines, and cut off the communication lines between Britain, the United States, and France with the Far East. Therefore, the attempt to invade Hainan Island has been carefully considered by the Japanese headquarters for more than a day. In the past, although there have been several attempts, no active actions have been seen because the diplomatic strategy adopted by Japan towards Britain and the United States during the war was the so-called appeasement of the United States and rejection of Britain. Once Hainan Island is occupied, it will not only cause a great backlash from Britain and France but may also arouse the antipathy of the United States because the Philippines is threatened. This is a major reason why they have hesitated to take risks for more than a year. On December 4th of last year, President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the 76th session of Congress, advocating that democratic countries should jointly sanction aggressor countries, followed by advocating the amendment of the Neutrality Act and the establishment of a defense of Guam. American merchants also refused to sell airplanes to Japan. The cooperation between Britain and the United States, which was considered difficult to achieve, has gradually become more concrete with the changes in the international situation. The joint action of democratic countries seems to have reached a mature stage. It can be seen that Japan's appeasement diplomacy has failed. In addition, British and American loans to China have become more active. The Japanese militarists, finding themselves in this situation of being unable to advance or retreat, simply hardened their hearts and took a great risk, dreaming that if they could achieve their threatening goal, Britain, the United States, and France might make concessions and cut off assistance to us. This is also one of the reasons why they invaded Hainan Island.</p>
<p>Third, since Barcelona fell into the hands of the rebel army supported by Italy and Germany, Italy's position in the Mediterranean has become increasingly dominant. Mussolini's demands for French territory have become increasingly tough. Observing the recent Italian military buildup in northern Libya, one knows what its intention is. As for Germany's movement for the return of its colonies, it has not been relaxed, and the promotion of the eastward expansion policy is still very active. In order to implement the international aggression policy of the German-Italian-Japanese axis, echoing Germany and Italy in the East and West, Japan had no choice but to carry out the attempt to occupy Hainan Island. From the Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island, it may be that a more serious crisis than that of last September will soon break out in Europe.</p>
<p>On the tenth, a Japanese naval spokesman said: "Japan's occupation of Hainan Island has two purposes: (1) to strengthen the blockade of military supplies, and (2) to defeat China as soon as possible and end the war." This is just a self-deceiving trick and not its true intention. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam and Guangxi-Vietnam routes, our country has two other routes for foreign communication, namely the Sino-Soviet and Yunnan-Burma routes. If it is said that occupying Hainan Island can block China's import of military supplies and defeat China as soon as possible, then that is simply a daydream!</p>
<h3>The Youth Salvation Movement in Chaoshan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenqiang</p>
<p>The local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside, relying on feudal forces, run rampant in the countryside, extorting from the people. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, they have not restrained themselves in the slightest. The tyranny of the local bullies directly oppresses the people, so that the people in the rear who have not yet been devastated by Japan feel that the abhorrence of the gentry power is even greater than that of the Japanese. The unconscious behavior of the local bullies in the countryside is an obstacle to mobilizing the people.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese national united front, the youth of the west, the struggle against feudalism, can only be carried out within the limits of destroying the united front. For the gentlemen in the countryside, try to avoid unnecessary occasions, often endure and deal with them, hoping to improve their political awareness and use their superior position to call on the people to fight to the death against Japanese traitors. However, avoiding friction should also have a limit, and the salvation movement should not be allowed to be destroyed in order to avoid friction. If someone wants to destroy the salvation movement, the salvation workers should deal with him with a spirit of struggle that is suitable for the environment. For the extortion and oppression of the unconscious squires, the salvation youth, in order to exert the anti-Japanese strength of the people, cannot but prevent it passively or actively. Therefore, the Qing Dynasty Movement, the feudal forces, it is inevitable to conflict. In the countryside, the considerable strong opposing forces have become an obstacle to the Qing Dynasty Movement.</p>
<p>Factional prejudices have not yet been eliminated in Chaoshan. Due to the lack of propaganda, the truth of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is still not clearly understood by many people in Chaoshan. When it comes to the Communist Party, some people still want to talk about tigers changing color, so the squires often put the "red hat" on the heads of the salvation youth as a means to destroy the Qing Dynasty Movement. The Qing Dynasty Movement is referred to as the activity of a certain political party. This kind of slander has indeed delayed its development a lot. Fortunately, the obstruction of feudal forces has gradually decreased with the expansion of the united front and the intensification of Japanese attacks.</p>
<p>Mobilizing the people is such a gigantic task. This kind of work, in Chaoshan, is mostly to be borne by the youth. Because the work is too heavy, I feel that my strength is too weak, especially the lack of cadres.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, because the political environment did not allow the open development of the salvation movement, very few active elements in Chaoshan youth participated in the salvation movement. In the great era, only a few youths with a history of work can afford the cadre work, so the lack of cadres is felt everywhere in the broad Qing Dynasty Movement. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, although many strong cadres have been cultivated in the actual struggle. However, the salvation work has also become more difficult with the progress of the War of Resistance, and the scope of work has become wider and deeper. The difficulty of the lack of cadres still exists.</p>
<p>Financial constraints are also a not small difficulty, which has prevented the progress of the Chaoshan Qing Dynasty Movement. Most of the members of the Qing Dynasty Resistance Association in various places are unemployed and out-of-school educated youths. They do not attach importance to personal interests and contribute all their energy to the salvation work. They cannot maintain their own lives and can only pay extremely light membership fees. Except for a few foreign affairs work that have achieved relatively good financial success, most of the Qing Dynasty Resistance Associations in various places have financial difficulties that have prevented the progress of the work. For example, the Qing Dynasty Resistance Association in various places wants to open night schools to educate the people, but they cannot raise money to buy ink, water, and paper, so there is no way to proceed. Many, many jobs often stagnate because there is no money. Financial difficulties are indeed a considerable difficult problem in the Chaoshan Qing Dynasty Movement.</p>
<p>The Central Task of the Present Stage</p>
<p>Chaoshan is the front line of national defense. After the fall of Guangzhou, it can also be said to be the rear of the Japanese. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Chaoshan, under the threat of the Japanese Navy, has revealed a serious crisis. Following the development of the situation of the War of Resistance, Chaoshan is increasingly approaching the crisis of war.</p>
<p>In the first stage of the War of Resistance, our military authorities have decided to implement a comprehensive strategy, that is, to launch extensive guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, maintain an enlarged area, and not fight with the Japanese for points and lines. There are no important cities or important military strongholds in Chaoshan. If the Japanese come to attack, we should not fight with the Japanese in positional warfare and regular warfare, but use guerrilla warfare to exhaust the Japanese, eliminate traitors, and defend Chaoshan.</p>
<p>As the War of Resistance expands further, Chaoshan will become a guerrilla area for burying the Japanese. The people's salvation movement in Chaoshan should take the preparation for guerrilla warfare as the central task, and the Qing Dynasty Movement, which is the central force of the people's salvation movement, should also fight for the preparation for guerrilla warfare. Based on this understanding, the Chaoshan Youth has actively prepared to launch guerrilla warfare, as the central task of the current stage.</p>
<p>When the Japanese come to attack, if the people are not fully prepared, they will inevitably present an abnormally flustered and chaotic state. In the chaotic state, it is possible to immediately launch the armed people's guerrilla warfare. The current preparatory work has an urgent need, and its achievements are sufficient to determine the future guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Chaoshan has several excellent guerrilla bases, such as Nanshan between Chaozhou and Huiyang counties, Fenghuang Mountain between Anxi and Jieyang counties. The Sangpu Mountain, which stretches between Anxi and Jiexi counties, and Tongziyang in Raohe County, are all Red Army bases during the civil war, which can be used as the general camp of the guerrilla team in the future Anti-Japanese War in Chaoshan. The Chaoshan Youth has already carried out the work of arranging the above-mentioned several future guerrilla team bases. The current people's movement work especially focuses on the training and organization of the people near the various bases, in order to consolidate the periphery of the various bases. The Shantou Qing Dynasty Resistance Association has sent out three working teams to the vicinity of Sangpu Mountain to carry out the people's movement work. The Qing Dynasty Resistance Association in various places also carries out its work according to the same policy.</p>
<p>The more deeply the salvation work of the Chaoshan Youth goes into the people, the more difficulties it encounters increase in degree; cadres are more lacking, the obstruction of feudal forces is more increasing, and the funds are also more difficult. The Chaoshan Youth is currently fighting to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties. First, intensify the training of cadres. Although the training of a strong cadre must go through work training, the cultivation of basic knowledge is also necessary. The Qing Dynasty Liaison Office and the Shantou Qing Dynasty Resistance Association once opened a short-term training class to train cadres, giving lectures on guerrilla tactics. The three subjects of international politics and the Three Principles of the People, increasing the basic knowledge of the trainees, can enable them to take on more work, receive more training, and become shrewd cadres more quickly. Second, promote the expansion and consolidation of the united front. After the warning of the rumbling artillery and the rattling machine, the Chaoshan people will definitely be able to recognize the meaning of being in the same boat even more. The Chaoshan Youth can take this opportunity to eliminate all internal friction; to make it more smooth. After the work of promoting the expansion and consolidation of the united front has achieved results, the problem of financial difficulties will be easily solved. If the enthusiasm of the youth's work has won the sympathy of the entire society, and people from all walks of life can recognize the value of the youth's work, then it will not be difficult to raise funds for how much work to prepare.</p>
<p>The Chaoshan Youth is making the greatest efforts to prepare for guerrilla warfare. The future fate of Chaoshan is largely determined by the preparatory work of the youth today. The Chaoshan Youth is making double efforts to intensify the struggle!</p>

<h3>Foreign Merchants Arrive in Hong Kong to Talk About the Recent Situation in the Old Capital. Toxic Substances Fill the City and Food Prices Soar. The Printing of Paper Money Is Rampant, and Its Use Is Forced.</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] A foreign merchant from the Old Capital said yesterday that the recent situation there, according to the report, is that the puppet provincial government is actually a mere shell, and the Japanese army's power cannot go half a step outside the city gate. All the power in the city is in the hands of the Japanese army, and the soldiers are at odds with each other, seemingly united but actually divided, fighting openly and secretly, and not giving way to each other. The most intense competition among them is among the four giants, namely, the North China Garrison, the Japanese Military Special Forces, the Military Police, and the South Manchuria Railway Garrison. Personnel of the puppet organizations are in the middle, and they are often blamed no matter what they do. The Chinese army guerrillas ambush on the four outskirts of Peiping, attacking secretly from time to time, which is difficult to defend against. The Japanese army only dares to lie dormant in the city to seek safety, using the Japanese army, which calls itself new and scientific, to defend this ancient city for thousands of years, which is ridiculous and pitiful. The Japanese army is also worried that the guerrillas will attack the city, so it has stationed heavy troops at the four gates of the city. Once it is dark, the city gates are tightly closed, and there are times when they dare not open them during the day, such as Deshengmen. Since the Japanese army occupied Peiping, it has not been opened. Martial law can be declared at any time and anywhere. Whenever important Japanese military officials come to the city, the traffic in the city must be cut off for four or five hours. Military police search people's homes and have almost become a daily routine. Even in the middle of the night, they still push open the door and search. Moreover, the Japanese military police often do not enter through the front door when searching houses, but climb over the wall when people are unprepared. As for searching pedestrians, it is all-encompassing. They often use the excuse of inspection and . In November of last year, the Japanese army's military warehouse was burned. Afterwards, anyone nearby who had matches was suspected of arson and was arrested and interrogated severely. The Japanese-established puppet Federation in North China is preparing to , and the amount of paper money issued is difficult to estimate. There is no guarantee at all. Citizens are forced to use it painfully under their guns and swords. Prices on the market are extremely expensive, especially sugar. The price of chicken eggs is soaring, because the Japanese army has captured and killed almost all the chickens inside and outside the city, and the Japanese goods that fill the market, the citizens hate, most do not want to buy. All the large-scale businesses in Peiping have been confiscated by the Japanese. Opium dens are everywhere, and such toxic substances as heroin and white powder are even more readily available. The Japanese have also established Japanese residential areas around the city. All houses and shops within the scope must be sold to the Japanese, and the price is freely estimated by them. The news media are as silent as cicadas under their iron hooves. The news published all comes from the Japanese side. The telephone company has become a Japanese military espionage station. Any telephone conversation that is slightly suspicious will be traced and arrested. Therefore, the citizens are all afraid of suffering unwarranted disasters, and most have had their telephones cut off.</p>

<h3>Intense War in Northern Qionghai, Large Force × Flanking from Mountain Side, × Commander Kondo Arrives at Haikou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 12th] The war north of Qiongshan is fierce, our troops are fighting valiantly, and reinforcements continue to land on the 12th, flanking Qiongshan from the side. Furthermore, Commander Kondo, Commander of the 3rd Destroyer Fleet, has arrived at Haikou.</p>
<p>Xinjiang Steamer Arrives in Hong Kong from Haikou, Shipowner Discusses × Invasion Situation</p>
<p>[Local News] Fierce battles continue to erupt on Hainan Island. Yesterday, the 10th and 11th, over twenty × warships gathered north of Qiongzhou, engaging in intense artillery battles with our Xiuying Fort. From morning till dusk, the sound of cannons roared without interruption. This news was brought by the Taizhan Shipping Company's Xinjiang vessel. The ship departed from Haikou at 1:00 PM on the 11th and arrived in Hong Kong at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Our reporter boarded the vessel to inquire about the situation in Haikou. According to the shipowner, the vessel arrived in Haikou from the sea at 7:00 AM on the 10th and anchored in the port. There were about twenty Japanese warships present. After 8:00 AM, they began an artillery battle with the Chinese military's fort. Simultaneously, over ten aircraft soared through the sky, and the sounds of bombing could be heard in Haikou. However, detailed information must be reported to the naval authorities before it can be disclosed. He redirected the reporter to inquire with the crew for more detailed information. However, he denied rumors about other ships, stating that the Xinjiang vessel was never questioned by × warships via radio in Haikou, and that it was communicating with the navy. The reason why cargo could not be loaded and unloaded was not due to any obstructive actions by Japanese warships, but rather because of the danger of artillery fire. Furthermore, the ship's clerk, Chen Xufang, told the reporter that the Xinjiang vessel arrived in Haikou early on the 10th. Haikou originally had no pier, so the vessel anchored in the port, which was very close to Xiuying Fort. There were over twenty × warships, among which about seven or eight were transport vessels with three smokestacks, each carrying around 500 × soldiers. The Xinjiang vessel arrived at 7:00 AM, and after 8:00 AM, the × warships began bombarding the Xiuying Fort. Our fort also returned fire. Simultaneously, × aircraft flew in to assist in the battle and bombed Haikou City. Until 11:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), the sound of cannons could still be heard. The × warships fired approximately over a hundred rounds. The Xinjiang vessel's initial anchoring point was very close to the × warships. Later, after the × warships began bombarding the land, they notified our vessel to move away, but our vessel ignored them. A × destroyer then sailed around the Xinjiang vessel's side before leaving. Our vessel used the radio to contact the Hong Kong office for instructions. It stayed overnight in Haikou and left for Hong Kong at 1:00 PM on the 11th. Due to the intense artillery fire, it was impossible to approach Haikou, so cargo could not be loaded and unloaded, and passengers could not disembark. According to another crew member, when the artillery fire stopped on the morning of the 11th, it was believed that × troops had already landed near the fort. Furthermore, the Xinjiang vessel arrived in Beihai from × Jiapo on the 8th and departed on the afternoon of the 9th. During these two days, × aircraft had been bombing the urban area of Beihai in shifts, several times a day, and the people there had already fled. It is reported that the Xiuying Fort in Haikou was built by Zhang Zhidong. The fort occupies a large area and has tunnels carved through the mountain as fortifications, with seven large cannons. In recent years, it has been greatly renovated and is quite strong. The fort is located in the fourth district of Haikou City and remotely controls the entrance to the Haikou port.</p>
<h3>Another Assassination in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] In Shanghai, at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Yuping Road in western Shanghai, another shooting occurred on the 11th. The victim was Luo Yi, the owner of a certain coal company. In addition to being shot twice, his head was also violently hacked several times, so he died before he could be sent to the hospital. The government requested an explanation from Japan regarding the purpose of the Japanese military occupying Hainan Island and the time frame for occupying the island. Currently, the British and French governments are continuing to exchange opinions on whether to issue a joint protest, which will depend on Japan's response. If the response is the same as that of the French side, Japan's purpose in occupying the island is to cut off the flow of military supplies into China. Japan is only using this as an excuse. Continued attacks on France, but French officials two previously declared that no military supplies from Annam border, imported into the Chinese mainland,</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Comment: Japanese Military Invades Hainan Island, British and French Attitudes Will Change</h3>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Paris, 11th] Last night, all evening newspapers vigorously stated that the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island has further complicated the situation in the Far East. "Times" stated, "Now, the question increasingly hinges on whether Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is temporary or permanent. If Japan attempts to permanently occupy the island, its violation of the spirit of the 1907 Franco-Japanese Agreement will be clearly evident. The Japanese military's occupation of the island has drastically changed the situation in the Far East, damaging France's interests, which cannot be ignored. France will naturally seek to address this. We greatly desire that Japan's intentions be clearly expressed as soon as possible, otherwise the British and French governments will inevitably be forced to change their attitudes towards the Sino-Japanese War."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Paris, 10th] After news of Japan's landing on Hainan Island in China reached here, French newspapers immediately engaged in discussions. This move by the Japanese military is sufficient to create new problems in Franco-Japanese relations, because in the future, the Chinese government will be willing to maintain Hainan Island's status quo and never cede it to a third country. If the Japanese military occupies the island, the situation will inevitably change. Although Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy, provided assurances, stating that his country has no aggressive intentions towards French territories, French Vietnam feels threatened by the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island. To verify the actual situation, or regarding Hainan Island, Japan previously used the excuse that the French and Japanese governments did not establish any agreement, but in reality, the island belongs neither to France nor to Japan, so how could either side enter into an agreement regarding it? However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly exchanged opinions, and the Japanese authorities have repeatedly provided assurances, declaring that they have no intention of occupying the island. Now that the Japanese military has landed on the island, it has broken this promise and violated the diplomatic policy announced by the Japanese authorities, which aimed to preserve the interests of all countries in the Far East. After the French punishment, trust in Japanese actions has been greatly diminished. In light of this, Japan's request to send a new ambassador to France will inevitably become more difficult.</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Comment: Hainan Island's Position is Important, Territories of All Countries are Controlled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Rome, 11th] The matter of the Japanese military landing on Hainan Island is currently being discussed by Italian newspapers. They assert that this move is sufficient to affect the interests held by major powers in the Far East. The official newspaper "Italian Daily" stated that after the Japanese military occupies Hainan Island, the territories of Hong Kong Island and the French-leased territories of Guangzhou Bay will be rendered useless. "Jiang Zeng News" stated that the Japanese government is calmly and resolutely awaiting any diplomatic actions by major powers. According to "News" (the newspaper of Foreign Minister Ciano), the nature of the Japanese military occupying Hainan Island is more significant than the capture of Dalian and Guangzhou City. The fall of Tianjin and Guangzhou only affects the economic interests of major powers, while the occupation of Hainan Island can alter the entire situation.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Remarks: Exposes ×'s Ambition to Control the Pacific, Points Out Hainan Island's Military Importance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the request of foreign journalists on the morning of the 11th, expressed his views on the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Question: What is Japan's true intention in invading Hainan Island this time? Answer: Regarding the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island, we should observe it from the perspective of the entire Far East maritime situation in order to recognize its significance and the magnitude of its impact. Hainan Island is a major strategic center in East Asia for the Pacific and Indian Oceans. If the × military occupies the island, it will not only completely block traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore, cut off communication between Singapore and Australia, but also subject the Philippines to its control. This not only directly threatens French Annam, but is actually the beginning of completely controlling maritime power in the Pacific. If the island falls into the hands of the Japanese military, the Japanese navy can look to the Mediterranean Sea westward through the Indian Ocean, and cut off communication between Singapore, Hawaii, Pearl Harbor, and British and American naval bases to the east. Therefore, this move by the Japanese military is clearly a response to the US naval vessel's visit to Singapore last year.</p>
<p>(2) Question: Why is Japan's move the beginning of controlling maritime power in the Pacific? Answer: We all know that Japan has three most important strategic locations in the Pacific. In the north is Sakhalin Island, in the west is Hainan Island, and in the east is Guam. If Japan wants to obtain complete control of the sea, it cannot forget any of these three places. If all three fall into Japan's hands, the Philippines and Hawaii will be equivalent to being occupied by Japan. Now Japan already occupies half of Sakhalin Island, and now it is attempting to occupy Hainan Island to cut off the British navy's contact with the United States to the east. If this plan is not stopped, Japan will further seek to control Guam. This will not only prevent the US navy from moving westward, but also cut off communication with the Philippines. Japan has been plotting for thirty years to create a communication line between these three major bases in order to carry out its southward policy and dominate the Pacific. When Japan fabricated the so-called North Sea Incident in 1936, its intention was to use it as an excuse to invade Hainan Island. However, due to concerns about other countries, it did not dare to launch an attack. Now it has resolutely disregarded everything and openly invaded Hainan Island. If it is not intentionally provoking a world war, it is the last risky move in its military aggression against China. It has been delayed for decades, but once it is decisively implemented, it is not only the first and greatest event since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, but also the sole key to changing the Pacific situation in the last thirty years. Since Japan does not hesitate to reveal its ambition, countries that have the deepest ties with the Far East cannot allow this dangerous scheme to proceed unimpeded. It should be understood that in the entire naval force of Japan, Hainan Island is the second gateway for Japan in the western Pacific, while Guam is its second gateway in the eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>(3) Question: Then what is Japan's first gateway, that is, its most forward position, in the east? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek smiled and replied: This is already clear to Europeans and Americans. Americans must know it, so there is no need for me to say more.</p>
<p>(4) Question: How will Japan's occupation of Hainan Island affect peace in the Far East? Answer: To answer this question, it must be known that Japan's invasion of Hainan Island on February 10 of this year (1939) is equivalent to the occupation of PanYang on September 18, 1931. In other words, Japan's attack on Hainan Island has created a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific. The regions may differ between land and sea, but the impact is exactly the same. Recalling the Shenyang Incident, except for the then US Secretary of State Stimson, the authorities of other countries did not take any measures, so Japan was able to continue to expand its aggression. Up to now, eight years later, it has created a situation in which it brazenly dominates East Asia, increasing its arrogance in conquering the world. Now Japan is attacking Hainan Island again. If it is allowed to occupy and control it, I predict that in less than eight years, the naval and air force bases in its design will be initially completed. Then the situation in the Pacific will suddenly change drastically. France wants to establish a naval base in Annam, and even if the United States wants to engage in fortification on Guam, it will not be able to wait. Therefore, Japan's resolute southward advance is not intended to end the Sino-Japanese War, but to prove that it will not hesitate to take risks in the future to create the beginning of the Pacific War.</p>
<p>(5) Question: What arrangements does China have for Hainan Island? Answer: China lacks naval power, so it cannot exclusively defend the coastline, but it has long prepared all land arrangements, and will do its best to fight the × military on the island and will never allow it to easily occupy it. As for the Japanese military's invasion of Beihai, we have long had thorough arrangements and precautions, and will give it a strong blow. Furthermore, this move has no significance in the ×'s own war of aggression against China, and will only put it in a more unfavorable position, as is understood by general military observers.</p>
<p>(6) Question: How will the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island affect the Sino-Japanese War? Answer: The Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island will not have much impact on our country's resistance war, because the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War will depend on land military operations. The occupation of an island or not is fundamentally unimportant.</p>
<h3>China Orders New Fighter Planes from the United States: Extremely Fast Speed and Combat Power, the Best of Modern Fighter Planes</h3>
<p>[Local News] Yesterday, the English weekly newspaper stated that according to reliable sources, the Chinese government has ordered a large batch of the latest "rocket-type" fighter planes from the United States. This new aircraft is the latest invention of scientists. The aviation industry calls it the "Bullet Plane" because of its bullet-like shape. It is produced by the famous Curtiss-Wright company. The speed and combat power of the new aircraft are the best of the fighter planes of various countries. Even the US Air Force has not adopted this type of fighter plane. With the Chinese Air Force obtaining this, its strength will be increased and it will be enough to control the × aircraft. Upon investigation, the structure of this new aircraft is based on the advantages of rockets and destroyers. The engine reaches 1,000 horsepower, the wings are 35 feet, and the total combat weight is only 4,000 pounds. The combat length is 26 and a half feet. The pilot's seat is inlaid with bulletproof steel plates. Its climbing power is very fast. If × aircraft attack, it can fly into the air within three minutes and fight with the ×. Within the first one minute and two seconds, it rises 5,000 feet, within two minutes and eight seconds, it rises to 10,000 feet, within four minutes and two seconds, 15,000 feet, and within six minutes, 20,000 feet. According to past experiences in China and Spain, aircraft usually drop bombs from an altitude of 7,000 feet, and rarely reach 20,000 feet, so the new aircraft's ability is sufficient to control and eliminate bombers. As for its speed, it can reach 300 mph at an altitude of 17,500 feet. However, this record is only based on official reports. Its maximum speed is definitely more than this. However, the US aviation authorities strictly maintain secrecy. The fuel storage capacity is 96 gallons, and it can support a flight of 600 miles at normal speed.</p>
<h3>Bombing in Transit Through Zhuzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Re-meeting the old place of Xiangtan, I felt particularly cordial and interesting. As soon as I entered the city, I was full of hope and ran to the county government to find acquaintances, but they had all changed careers to serve at the front; but I didn't feel disappointed, but rather happy and congratulatory! Looking at the notices in front of the county government, the newly appointed County Magistrate Wang Jihui had only taken office for a few days. Mr. Wang is a respected local gentleman with a reputation for fairness. He has great aspirations to have a local person serve as a local official, and plans to mobilize all the able-bodied men among the county's 1.1 million people, give them strict training, and fully arm them to make a great contribution to protecting the country and defending their hometown. This is not a matter of temporary expedience, because the county's able-bodied men have been trained in the past, totaling × × tens of thousands of people, and their strength is already considerable. However, their age is 25 to 35 years old. In the future, it is planned to increase the age limit to 18 to 45 years old. In this way, the county can mobilize more than × × tens of thousands of able-bodied men. The public's anti-× sentiments are very high. Things like donating money and goods, comforting wounded soldiers, and supplying military orphans are all met with unanimous response and enthusiastic participation. The general public's life can generally maintain a petty bourgeois state. Laborers have increased job opportunities and increased wage income. For example, rickshaw pullers can earn about two yuan per day, and boatmen and porters can earn more than one yuan. Military orphans can get at least five jiao, so their lives are more comfortable than usual.</p>
<p>——The above piece of simple and unpretentious information was told to me by a county government clerk who was experienced in the ways of the world. Although this clerk's speech was a bit clumsy, his manner was very cautious, and he was a mature and prudent person who knew how to "manage a county." This conversation, although without any high-level discussion, gave me a very deep impression. I was waiting in a hall-style reception room in the county government. The clerk, wearing a leather robe, strode in confidently, first bowing deeply to me from a distance, then introducing himself by his surname and sitting down. A tall, strong man then followed in. The clerk seemed to want to introduce him, first looking at me, then looking at him, but in fact he did not introduce him. Instead, he calmly stood up, reached into his clothes, and after fumbling for a while, took out a foreign dollar, and asked the strong man to buy a box of cigarettes and several betel nuts to entertain me—none of which I was lucky enough to enjoy, especially the extremely spicy betel nuts (made with lime and spicy medicinal materials). I had the experience of eating one and breaking my lips and teeth when I came to Hunan before (but the locals like to eat them like tobacco and alcohol, and they can help digestion). I politely declined. When the conversation began, at a crucial point, the clerk, with an attitude of "courtesy first, then force," asked me serious questions, saying that the county government had not received any official documents when I went to the county government to interview. So I quickly took out my "protective charm"—not a "thousand-person seam" but a military certificate—to show him, which cleared the clouds and allowed me to continue the conversation. At the same time, he waved his hand, and the strong man also disappointedly retreated.</p>
<p>It's no wonder he had to be so overly cautious; because in the previous month, someone impersonated a Shen Bao salesman, promoting Shen Bao in Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Shaoyang, saying how the Shanghai Shen Bao maintained its inherent spirit and resumed publication, and how the Hong Kong Shen Bao struggled to expand its content. In order to make it easier for readers in the mainland to subscribe, they specifically sent people to promote it, and so on. The reason was quite convincing, so some institutions and schools directly subscribed to it. Only after not receiving the newspaper for a long time did they realize they had been deceived. The reporter immediately drafted an advertisement, explaining that this newspaper never sent people to sell it alone, and sent it to the local newspaper for publication to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>I stayed in a hotel overnight, and there were actually "uninvited guests," singing prostitutes, who successively entered the rooms of travelers, using the excuse of livelihood difficulties, and asked to sing to cheer them up. One traveler couldn't refuse and lost his temper, saying: "What livelihood difficulties or no difficulties? This is simply like Wang Jingwei's plea for peace, deceiving yourself and others, who cares about your tricks!" This gentleman was quick-witted and cursed the prostitute, even dragging Wang Jingwei along with him. It can be described as ingenious; however, I feel sorry for the sweat of Wang Jingwei!</p>
<p>It is convenient to travel from Xiangtan to Changsha by water and land. I wanted to go to Miluo to inspect first, so I took the train east to Xiangqian to Zhuzhou, and then transferred to the Han train north. The Xiangqian Road to Zhuzhou is connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road. The two roads have one direct train to each other every day, which can smoothly pass through Jinhua, Zhejiang to the east, and will reach the Qianbian × × to the west. Zhuzhou is the central station of the north-south and east-west main lines in central China, so it is naturally inevitable to be bombed and harassed by the × people. The station has been bombed into ruins and walls, and the repair shop has also moved elsewhere. Dozens of nearby hotels and shops have been burned and bombed, leaving only a pile of rubble and ashes. The shops and residential buildings here are mostly built of wood. Once they are bombed and burned, the disaster is extremely tragic! However, although × aircraft are constantly wreaking havoc in Zhuzhou, the bombing is aimless and has never hindered the transportation on the two roads. Moreover, our general railway employees (not only Zhuzhou Station) are able to work diligently and have a spirit of sacrifice. As soon as they learn that the track, bridge, or roadbed has been bombed, they immediately transport and repair it according to the principle of repairing it as soon as it is damaged, and rush to repair it in a very short time. The train is also equipped with a radio to listen to the alarm at any time, so that the train can be stopped (if it is near a cave, it will retreat into it), so that passengers can take refuge in the mountains and fields. Therefore, the result of the × aircraft's threat to the two roads for 18 months has no impact on the military on both sides, but it only exposes its brutal behavior and inspires our hatred of the enemy.</p>
<p>While waiting for the train at the station, I unexpectedly met three wounded soldiers who had just arrived from Shanghai. So we chatted under the weak morning sunlight. They were subordinates of Hu Zongnan who were severely injured during the Battle of Shanghai and only recently recovered. They were taken care of by the × × Relief Committee, who disguised them and sent them to Wenzhou by boat, and then they took a car to Jinhua and transferred to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train to safely arrive here. They were determined to return to their team in × × Province to continue the war of resistance. They said: "After our army moved west from Shanghai in the winter of the year before last, there were about 20,000 wounded soldiers left in Shanghai and the concession. Except for the very few who went missing or died of illness, the rest have been treated and sent to various war zones in batches. However, the number of people who took the initiative to find ways to join the Jinghu guerrillas nearby is also very considerable. Of course, they were injured in the battle in that area, so they are particularly familiar with the terrain. Now they have joined the already powerful guerrillas, and it is not a boast, it is really 'adding wings to a tiger.' No wonder the general × army and traitors are so frightened that they still have to touch their heads in the middle of the night to see if their heads have moved!"</p>
<p>Just as we were talking with great interest, we suddenly heard a long and majestic alarm. This seemed like an alert and loving hen, discovering that a fierce and incomparably ferocious bird of prey had flown into the sky, and quickly called to protect her innocent chicks, and sent all of us scattered people into the solid air-raid shelters!</p>
<p>Inside the shelter, we actually heard "bang bang bang" sounds six or seven times, but when we came out after the all-clear, we only saw that a pile of salt on the platform had been bombed a little, and two or two empty civilian houses outside. In addition, a few old bomb craters were leveled. As a railway supervisor said when he went to check, speaking in a Henan accent: "× his sister! What's the point of bombing Zhuzhou all day long!" The implication was that it was superfluous to even bother to come and check.</p>

<h3>Germany Invites French Foreign Minister to Negotiate European Issues; Spanish Cabinet Continues to Discuss the War Situation; Rebel Forces Advance Towards Valencia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] The German government has once again invited French Foreign Minister Bonnet to visit Germany in the near future for discussions with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on general European issues, particularly Central European issues, the Spanish issue, and Italy's natural desires. The French government previously dispatched Coulondre to Germany last week for talks with Ribbentrop. Coulondre has now returned, and regarding the report on the discussions, it is said that the German Foreign Minister stated that he had previously come to France to sign the Franco-German non-aggression declaration, and Bonnet's visit should therefore be a natural consequence.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Perpignan, 11th] The Spanish government cabinet convened a meeting in Valencia to discuss the ongoing war situation and other important issues, and to strive for aid from Britain and France, as well as international sympathy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Madrid, 12th] Various responsible authorities of the Republican government have already returned here, and Spanish officials have expressed a warm welcome. The residents here are extremely calm.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 12th] The Spanish cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon, but what was discussed is unknown. Foreign Minister Del Vayo estimates that approximately 400,000 Catalan refugees have now fled into France.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 12th] The political situation in Spain has now been replaced by military developments. The recent major victories of the rebel forces have created the main reason for their establishment of power. A spokesperson for the rebel side told a Reuters reporter: "Everything will continue to be proven by facts. As in Catalonia, we will treat the enemy fairly, without bias. Sooner or later, when the people of Madrid and Valencia thoroughly understand our wishes, the war will naturally end." Declarations by important Spanish government figures vowing to fight to the end are met with skepticism here, but the rebel side also seems unwilling to compromise. The rebels express satisfaction with the legal recognition of the Franco government by Britain and France. They say that this recognition is most appropriate at the present time, without waiting for the complete annihilation of the government forces and the complete withdrawal of Italian and German volunteers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Barcelona, 11th] The Spanish rebel authorities have announced that the port of Barcelona is open, and the sunken ships in the port (bombed by rebel aircraft) have been cleared. They also stated that the Argentine government has decided that the Negrín government no longer exists.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Perpignan, 11th] Franco is currently commanding a large army to advance towards Valencia, hoping to crush the last resistance of the government forces in one fell swoop, and has sent heavy troops to attack the Gaohan area to cut off the traffic lines between Valencia and the central areas. The rebel forces have also dispatched aircraft to continuously bomb, causing much damage to houses. The British ship "Fortune" was also hit. Although the government forces are determined to resist to the end, the general public believes that the future situation is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 12th] According to unconfirmed reports from Madrid yesterday afternoon, the British ship "Fortune," with a deadweight of 1,250 tons, was hit and sunk during a rebel air raid on Valencia.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 12th] Approximately 300,000 Spanish Republican government soldiers and civilians fled to France last week, including over 160,000 militiamen, who are currently detained in concentration camps in Argelès-sur-Mer, Saint-Cyprien, and Villegailles. There are also 18,000 in the Bram camp. Another 15,000 militiamen are currently crossing the mountain roads of Arles and Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste and will arrive in French territory. The additional motorcycle guards and gendarmes dispatched by France have gradually begun to withdraw since Saturday and have been transferred to various concentration camps to take responsibility for surveillance.</p>
<h3>US Navy Begins Exercises Today; New Battleships to Participate; Situation More Comprehensive Than Last Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The largest naval exercise in American history will begin on the 13th to test America's defense capabilities against an attack on America from Europe and Africa. The exercise area extends from the Caribbean Sea to the Amaxon River estuary in South America. 140 warships and 600 aircraft will participate. The ships and aircraft are concentrated in Guantanamo and are scheduled to depart for designated locations tomorrow morning. A portion of the fleet will attack the Panama Canal and other strategic locations. All countries passed by the American fleet are presumed to be either friendly, neutral, or enemies. How they are designated has not been announced. The results of this exercise attacking Panama will serve as the basis for strengthening Panama's military fortifications. A naval authority stated that the difference between this exercise and the previous large-scale Atlantic exercise is that everything has been improved. In the large-scale exercise held in 1934, because America's new shipbuilding plan had just begun to be implemented, very few new battleships participated. Now, America has added 435 new warships, so the situation has completely changed.</p>
<h3>Public Memorial for the Pope Begins Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 12th] The grand ceremony for the enshrinement of Pope Pius XI was held here yesterday. The sacred remains were placed next to Pius X.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Vatican City, 11th] The remains of Pope Pius XI are currently lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica. All Catholics are permitted to enter to pay their respects. The Pope's remains are covered with a deep red sleeveless cloak, dressed in a white woolen bishop's robe, draped with a white and gold papal stole, wearing a gold mitre, and with a bishop's ring on his finger. When the Pope's remains are moved, diplomatic personnel from various countries and important officials will line up in the shape of a cross to lead the procession. The period for paying respects has been set for nine days, starting today. 50,000 people are waiting outside the basilica to enter and pay their respects.

<h3>Dutch Defense Minister Drafts Military Expansion Plan; Strengthen Border Garrison Units; Construct Fortresses and Build Ships Extensively</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, The Hague, 12th] According to an official report yesterday, Dutch Defense Minister Van Dijk has drafted a memorandum on a military expansion plan, which has been submitted to the Upper House. According to its contents, the units of the Dutch border garrison must be strengthened. New defense line projects and fortress construction will continue. Its form will not imitate the heavy artillery fortresses of the Maginot Line. However, due to the nature of the land, the construction of local airports has been realized. Regarding the defense issues of the Dutch East Indies, the Netherlands has decided to follow the major naval powers such as Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, Japan, and Russia, and build ships on the largest scale. Efforts will be made to expand and modernize the naval air force. The light fleet will also be greatly enhanced, and civilian merchant ships will be increased, as in wartime preparations, so that they can be converted into auxiliary cruisers. The government is also striving to support industrial development for military equipment production. Small-caliber guns and artillery will be manufactured domestically. Storage depots for food and military supplies will be protected from air raid damage.</p>

<h3>The Danger of Japan</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bao Ren</p>
<p>New York INTERNATIONAL PRESS</p>
<p>Author J.H.ROBiNSON</p>
<p>If we can observe even a little, anyone would know that the situation of life-and-death opposition between China and Japan has undergone drastic changes. After Guangzhou and Hankou were successively occupied by the Japanese army, China's attitude towards resistance became even more resolute than before. This bloody war has aroused the roar of the Chinese people; the whole country can unite as one to protect their country. Millions of farmers and young students, under the guidance of the Chinese command, are carrying out mobile warfare and flanking warfare. They have already received large-scale training and organization in this art, which makes Japan lose all important meaning in the land it occupies in China. Therefore, the occupation of new land only increases Japan's difficulties at the front and in the rear, making its aggressive steps against China more and more frantic and chaotic. Here, we will expose the dangers and weaknesses of Japan.</p>
<p>The greatest danger of Japan during wartime lies in the economic aspect, and the most obvious phenomenon in the economic aspect is the contradiction between Japan's domestic light industry and heavy industry, which is becoming increasingly acute due to the war. The so-called light industry here refers to textiles, papermaking, canned food, etc., most of which can be called civilian-needed industries. The so-called heavy industry refers to guns, artillery, airplanes, etc., most of which in Japan can be called military-needed industries. In the past ten years, in order to compete with the great powers and realize its ambition of continental policy, Japan had to accelerate the development of its heavy industry. The main reason for the previous armed occupation of North China was also to seize raw materials for military manufacturing. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan's need for these raw materials has become even more urgent, and it has had to spend a large amount of gold to purchase them from abroad. Light industry has been hit hard by the abnormal development of domestic heavy industry, and it has declined sharply, like a river flowing downhill.</p>
<p>During the Hayashi Cabinet era, the government actively developed the military-needed industry, so this period can be called the preparation-for-war period. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it gradually changed to the all-out-war period. Until the appointment of Itagaki as Minister of the Army, he declared that the Sino-Japanese War might have to be extended to ten years, and Vice-Minister Tojo, based on the instructions of the Tokyo Imperial Conference on December 20, stated even more clearly that Japan was eager to prepare to deal with the Soviet Union. From the above facts, we can know that Japan's current situation actually contains the dual nature of all-out-war and preparation-for-war. Because of this reason, the new slogan of "national defense and military needs" of the Japanese is more clamorous than before, and the abnormal development of its heavy industry is like a blind man riding a blind horse, with the danger of collapse at any time. In the past, during the Hirota Cabinet era, Japan wanted to implement the policy of both people's livelihood and military preparations, but it failed. The Hayashi Cabinet obliterated people's livelihood and focused on military preparations, but it was only a temporary solution. Although the Konoe Cabinet was able to continue to obliterate people's livelihood under the pretext of war, this method is by no means a long-term solution for stability. The main reason for the recent resignation of the Konoe Cabinet and Finance Minister Ikeda is nothing more than a reflection of Japan's economic difficulties.</p>
<p>From the Mukden Incident to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, in the short span of six years, the increase in capital of Japan's civilian-needed industries decreased from 65% to 38%. During the same period, the increase in capital of Japan's military-needed industries increased from 35% to 62%. After the outbreak of the war, the Japanese authorities more actively encouraged investment in heavy industry. In September 1937, 2.1 billion yen of private investment was designated for heavy industry, and of this amount, 62% had been invested in purely military-needed industries by the end of last year. As for the war expenditure allocated by the Japanese government, at least 30% was consumed on raw materials for heavy industry. The current government has set the following amounts for war expenditure: 1937...2,530; 1938...4,850; 1939...5,000 (in millions of Japanese yen).</p>
<p>In addition to the war expenditure, there are also the regular expenses of the Army and Navy Ministries, which account for 50% to 60% of the Japanese government's budget. A portion of these regular expenses is also invested in purely military-needed industries.</p>
<p>Because the military-needed industry is encouraged by the government and at the same time promoted by the war, the total value of profits of Japan's domestic military-needed industry has also increased dramatically. According to the statistics published in the December 1938 issue of "Japan Review," the total value of profits of various military-needed industries in the first half of 1938 increased by 38% compared with the first half of 1937. Among them, the profit margin of the hemp industry increased by 48%, the shoe industry increased by 43%, the metal industry increased by 42%, the chemical industry increased by 41%, and the profits of the mining and machinery industries each increased by 34%.</p>
<p>Because Japan's heavy industry is abnormally expanding and light industry is gradually declining, the people's livelihood in the country is deteriorating, and complaints are rife. The people, seeing the military's aggressive atrocities and the suffering caused by the war, all hate war. The following two tables can show the general situation of the Japanese people's lives during wartime.</p>
<p>National Expenditures</p>
<p>1930-1932 1,588,800,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>1937-1938 2,870,000,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>Military Expenses</p>
<p>1930-1932 470,000,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>1937-1938 2,400,000,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>National Tax Revenue</p>
<p>1930-1932 805,000,000 Japanese yen</p>

<p>1930-1931 6,000,000,000 Japanese yen</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Strengthening Air Combat Capabilities</h3>
<p>Our country does not have a strong navy, which has created the tragedy of thousands of miles of coastline being completely blockaded. However, the characteristics of our country's economy and society enable us to continue to support the war of resistance without being threatened by the complete blockade of the coastline.</p>
<p>Our country does not have huge air combat power, so in the nineteen months since the war of resistance, although our young air force has built world-shattering feats, due to the limitations of material conditions on the replenishment and development of the air force, it has not only failed to fully achieve the goal of assisting the army in repelling the Japanese army, but also failed to reduce the losses and sacrifices of the people in the rear, so in the new stage of the war of resistance, how to actively consolidate and enhance the air combat power is really one of the major tasks of the entire nation.</p>
<p>According to a Chongqing telegram from this newspaper on the 12th, our country is currently negotiating to increase the direct air routes between China, the Soviet Union, and France, and the air route between China and Britain will be realized at the latest by the beginning of next month. According to Hong Kong news, in order to replenish the air force, the new-style fighter planes purchased in the United States will be shipped here in the near future. It is also said that the anti-Japanese movement in France has been increasingly fierce recently, and the first batch of 18 aviation talents is already on their way east. What exciting news this is!</p>
<p>Our country's war of resistance is inseparable from the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement, especially with the current interests of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are completely consistent, and the outbreak of the Japanese attack on Hainan Island can further prove this point. Today, we must not only intensify the protection of the international transport lines on the southwest and northwest mainland, but also quickly realize and increase the air contact lines with democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. And the mutual aid work of the anti-aggression air forces should also be promoted. We hope that the people will warmly support the government's policy of strengthening air combat power, and use action to promote this policy.</p>
<h3>Denouncing Recognition of Spanish Rebels</h3>
<p>It is reported that the rulers of the United Kingdom and France are about to recognize the Spanish rebels and their puppet National Army government, and this will become a reality.</p>
<p>The democratic Republican government of the Spanish Popular Front is the universally recognized legitimate government; the Spanish rebels and the puppet National Army government are tools of the German and Italian aggressive countries that violate the general will of Spain and the will of the democratic countries of the world. We don't know where these rulers who are preparing to recognize the Spanish rebels and the puppet National Army government will place themselves?</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to blame these rulers for reason and justice, given that they proceed from the class interests of their financial capital leaders! What we want to solemnly point out is that the illusion of these rulers maintaining Spanish development rights and transferring the direction of the aggressors under the influence of Italy and Germany is just a nightmare. This nightmare will put Britain and France under the direct attack of European fascism. This nightmare will allow the oriental aggressors to take the opportunity to promote their "New Order in the Far East" and "Pacific Hegemony War"! This nightmare will further intensify the anti-movement within Britain and France, and make these rulers reap the consequences!</p>
<p>Our task, the task of all the world's righteous progressive people and the working masses, is not to sit back and watch these rulers reap the consequences, but to intensify our unity, unification, consolidation, and development of our own strengths, to use action to awaken this nightmare that endangers the world and mankind, and to use action to prevent the formation of these evil consequences.</p>

<h3>Shantou Has Become the Only Import and Export Port in Southwest China: Trade Between Hong Kong and Shantou Has Increased Greatly; Cargo from Jiangxi Via Guangdong Is Completely Concentrated in Shantou; Trade with Hong Kong Has Increased More Than Fivefold</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since the outbreak of the war in South China, Xiamen in Fujian and Guangzhou in Guangdong have unfortunately fallen successively, and the transportation and trade between the Southwest and the international community have been greatly affected. The only direct transportation lines between Hong Kong and the mainland are Fuzhou and Shantou. In terms of location, Shantou is closer to Hong Kong and has more frequent ship schedules. Therefore, trade between Hong Kong and Shantou has made great progress after the war. According to a prominent Shantou merchant in Hong Kong, Shantou has now become the economic hub of the three provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Fujian. All imports and exports of goods from the three provinces must be transshipped through this port. All the trade that used to be in Xiamen and Guangzhou is also concentrated in Shantou. Therefore, Shantou is concentrating the trade of three places in one place. Due to the impact of Shantou's economic prosperity, trade between Hong Kong and Shantou has also increased. The total trade volume has increased more than five times. In the past three months, goods transported from Hong Kong to Jiangxi via Shantou have reached more than 10 million yuan. The numbers for Shantou itself and various places in northern Guangdong are similar. Although Fujian is slightly less, the development of trade can be seen from this. Therefore, in the four months since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou's turnover has exceeded the total number of the previous year. Most of the goods transported from Hong Kong to Shantou and then to various places are daily necessities and foreign goods. At the same time, many local products from the mainland are also gathered in Shantou for shipment to Hong Kong. In recent months, all foreign goods in Jiangxi Province have been in short supply. Merchants in the province have rushed to Shantou to purchase goods to meet the demand. Since the fall of Xiamen, merchants in southwestern Fujian have also asked Shantou to replenish their goods. Therefore, Shantou's commerce is also booming. During the intense bombing of Shantou, the population once dropped to 40,000 to 50,000. At present, it has returned to its original state, and even increased. The current population of the city is about 130,000, and more than 10,000 passengers travel to and from the city every day.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents Association Requests Authorities to Protect Businesses and Schools, Restrict Landlords from Forcing Evictions and Avoid Unreasonable Oppression</h3>
<p>Since the Hong Kong authorities promulgated the regulations to protect tenants and prevent landlords from forcing evictions, the trend of forced evictions has been slightly curbed, and ordinary people do not have to suffer from displacement. However, the regulations only apply to people's residences. If businesses, schools, and offices are forced to relocate, the suffering is very serious, and some even lose their homes because of this. For this reason, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents Association held a standing council meeting last night and decided to petition the government to promulgate special chapters to protect schools, businesses, and offices. The matters discussed included (1) reporting matters, (A) announcing the previous resolution, (B) regarding the association's address, as the one found is not applicable, and it is necessary to choose another one, and (C) the petition to the government to protect businesses, schools, offices, and social groups. It was resolved that the association's general affairs director, Liao Bingquan, would consult with the association's legal advisor to submit the petition. (2) Proposed items (A) organize member publications to make members aware of relevant laws in Hong Kong, (B) discuss the number of members solicited for the first time and the extent of the association's constitution and budget, (C) association matters, roughly to petition the government, and it was resolved that the association's general affairs director, Liao Bingquan, would consult with the association's legal advisor to submit the petition.</p>

Frederick de Leuth was elected president, and Hou Weilong served as manager. Thomson Auditors served as voluntary accountants. Several famous commercial firms have expressed their willingness to set up booths at the association to advertise and sell goods, and several enthusiastic people and shops have donated silver dollars as prizes. Other matters, such as the responsibilities of various departments, have also been roughly decided. The Hong Kong veterinary officer and Frank Krueger will be responsible for inspecting the dogs participating in the exhibition. The list of judges is currently being selected.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Association Submits to Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Requesting Permission for Employed Fishermen to Return to Hong Kong Freely: Those with Badges May Be Exempt from Showing HK$20</h3>
<p>Most of the Hong Kong fishermen are from the mainland. It is natural for them to miss their families at the end of the year. However, they mostly go to the mainland via Macau. Now there are many fishermen who are worried that they will not be allowed to land when they return due to Hong Kong regulations unless they have HK$20. Yesterday, they jointly complained to the local Fisheries Association and requested a solution so that they would not be refused entry when they returned to Hong Kong after returning home. The Fisheries Association submitted a report to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, requesting that from the 19th to the 26th of this month, all fishermen coming to Hong Kong from Macau who have a Fisheries Association card with a photo that matches their identity or wear a Fisheries Association badge be exempt from showing HK$20 and be allowed to land. The approval of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs is still pending.</p>

<h3>A Letter from Home Is Worth a Fortune! Mail Delivery to the Northern Guangdong Area Has Resumed: Transported to Shantou and Hong Kong Via the Shao-Mei Highway; All Areas in Western Guangdong Can Also Be Reached</h3>
<p>Since Guangzhou fell into enemy hands, mail delivery between Hong Kong and the mainland, which passed through Guangzhou, has been interrupted. The two sides are cut off from each other, and those who miss their hometowns are saddened. According to a reporter's investigation, mail delivery between Hong Kong and the mainland, which could not be reached, has now been restored through the efforts of our postal authorities and the Hong Kong authorities. Areas in eastern and western Guangdong that have not fallen can now be reached. As for the northern Guangdong area, mail delivery was also interrupted due to the fall of Guangzhou, and news was completely cut off. Now the central postal authorities are making every effort to make it accessible, using the Mei-Shao route to transport mail. A trial run has been successful. After that, mail to the northern Guangdong area, such as Yingde, Qingyuan, Qujiang, Wengyuan, Qiannan, Xinfeng, Ruyuan, Yangshan, Lechang, Shixing, Renhua, and Lianxian, can be transported to Shantou and then to Hong Kong via the Shao-Mei Highway. Hong Kong mail can also reach northern Guangdong via this route. In order to ensure that mail arrives safely, our authorities have specially dispatched military postal officers to inspect and manage everything. From now on, news between Hong Kong and northern Guangdong will not be completely cut off.</p>

<h3>Four Pirates on Jiao Xi Sea Area: Disguised as Passengers, Hijacking Hong Kong-Sai Kung Ferry: Brandished Guns Mid-Journey, Threatening the Owner to Change Course to Ma Shi Wan: Stolen Cash and Goods Worth Over Three Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>The unrest on the river is now even worse. There have been repeated reports of cargo boats and fishing boats being robbed at sea. It was thought that the banditry had subsided, but during this Lunar New Year, there was an even more shocking incident. Four people dared to hijack a ferry traveling between Hong Kong and Sai Kung. Although the crew and passengers were safe, the value of the cash and goods stolen was over three thousand eight hundred yuan. The details of the hijacking are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Sai Kung Ferry Threatened Daily</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Sai Kung ferry travels between Hong Kong Island and Sai Kung in the New Territories. The ferry's berth in Hong Kong is in Sai Wan. It departs at 10 a.m. every day, arrives in, drops off passengers and cargo, sails out of Lei Yue Mun, and goes straight to Sai Kung. After arriving in Sai Kung, it returns to Hong Kong at 2:30 p.m. There are a total of eleven crew members on the ferry. The owner's name is Zheng Hanzhou (28 years old). The ferry carries about 30-40 passengers every day. The cargo coming to Hong Kong is daily food items such as live pigs, firewood, and vegetables. It has always been safe.</p>
<p>Disguised as Passengers, Brandishing Guns to Threaten</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (11th), the ferry sailed as usual. After unloading cargo in Sai Kung, it loaded passengers and cargo and returned to. In addition to 31 passengers, there were also a lot of salted fish, firewood, conch, live pigs, and other miscellaneous goods. After departing from Sai Kung, at around 3 p.m., it arrived at. Suddenly, on the Jiao Xi sea area, a middle-aged man wearing black shirt and trousers walked into the wheelhouse and immediately pulled out a short-barreled revolver, threatening the owner Zheng Hanzhou and his assistants, forcing them to ring the bell and turn the boat northeast. Mr. dared not resist and had to obey. At the same time, there were also three robbers on the deck. Two of them pulled out short-barreled revolvers, threatening the passengers and sailors in the boat. The other robber seized the kitchen knife on the boat to assist. These four robbers spoke with Cantonese accents and were extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Arrives to Pick Up the Thieves</p>
<p>Before long, it arrived at Huoshi Island in Ma Shi Wan. The robbers ordered the boat to stop and immediately drove all 42 passengers and crew members into the hold, searching them one by one. All the cash, gold, and silver jewelry were looted. Passengers were also forced to hand over their slightly more valuable clothes. At this time, a fishing boat sailed over and docked next to the ferry. The people on the fishing boat then helped the robbers to move all the cargo and other stolen goods on the ferry onto the fishing boat. They immediately set sail towards Ma Shi Wan.</p>
<p>Loss of Money and Goods Reaches Over Three Thousand</p>
<p>Before leaving, the robbers fired shots into the air to demonstrate, claiming that they must not be chased, otherwise they would sink the ferry. After the robbers left, everyone dared to return to the deck. The ferry then sailed back to Hong Kong. It was already 10 p.m. It was still a long way from Hong Kong. Before long, when it sailed to the sea near Xie Po Chau, it saw police boat No. 1 sailing towards it. It signaled the Sai Kung ferry to stop. The detectives in the boat immediately boarded the Sai Kung ferry to investigate. The owner Zheng Hanzhou reported that they were robbed by pirates on the way. They then continued to sail back to Hong Kong. At around 11 p.m., it sailed to the Hong Kong sea area and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Marine Police Station. The total loss from this hijacking, including cash and ornaments such as bracelets and gold rings, was estimated at 3,000 yuan. The goods were worth about 800 yuan. The total was about 3,877.20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Exhibition to Be Held in Peninsula</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Air Defense Authority held an air defense exhibition in August last year to raise awareness of air defense knowledge among people from all walks of life. It is heard that the bureau is planning to hold a larger exhibition in the Peninsula during the day and has appointed several committee members to be responsible for organizing everything. The date, location, etc. will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Book and Painting Charity Exhibition to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by celebrities organized by the International Art Academy has been prepared and will be held tomorrow on the seventh floor of the China Department Store. It is hoped that the calligraphy and painting circles will participate as soon as possible, and an impromptu calligraphy and painting section will be added to increase revenue.

<h3>Establishing a "Writers' Symposium" - Literary Workers Unite</h3>
<p>— Tie Guang</p>
<p>Hong Kong's literary and art workers are now flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain. These literary and art workers are partly transplanted from mainland China and partly newly grown locally. Under the mutual reflection of the literary fruits transplanted from the mainland and those grown locally, Hong Kong's new literary movement will have a more solid future. But this requires the arduous efforts of literary and art workers.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of progressive literary and art workers in Hong Kong responded to the Chongqing "Literary Association's" general call for unity among cultural workers, and many comrades have since provided many practical suggestions. As a result, the issue of unity among Hong Kong's literary workers has sprung from the hearts of every literary worker. It is not only springing from their hearts, but also many active and enthusiastic individuals are working separately. Although there are no concrete reports on the progress of these activities, the steps are proceeding smoothly. As objective conditions mature, this undertaking of unity among literary workers will inevitably succeed.</p>
<p>Now, the first thing worth reporting to literary workers is that a group of active literary workers have begun preparations to organize a "Writers' Symposium." This "Writers' Symposium" will be a powerful institution for promoting the new literary movement and will bloom as a fighting flower of art on this desolate literary island. It is hoped that everyone will gather here and surround it.</p>
<p>The organizational staff of the "Writers' Symposium" only require that a person is able to write, and supports the War of Resistance and unity. It does not matter whether they are famous or unknown, old or young, or belong to any party or faction.</p>
<p>The central tasks of the "Writers' Symposium" are to study writing theory and techniques, study the new situation and new problems, and enrich the cultivation of each author. At the same time, it will strictly criticize and denounce all cultural work that is harmful to the War of Resistance, recognize and implement the new tasks of each new situation and new problem, intensify individual work and self-criticism, monitor cultural conspiracies, and strive to win over backward literati and readers in Hong Kong. In addition, it will establish close ties with domestic literary and art organizations. And resolutely eliminate the incorrect style of "drinking tea and talking idly."</p>
<p>The atmosphere of literary resistance from the motherland is about to circulate. Soon, the "Writers' Symposium" will be seen performing its due work.</p>

<h3>Old Conspiracy in New Guise</h3>
<p>— Chen Shaoyu</p>
<p>Speech at the Yan'an People's Anti-Japanese Rally</p>
<p>(I) Wang Jingwei is a Loudspeaker of the Enemy</p>
<p>Comrades! Fellow compatriots from all walks of life!</p>
<p>Today, five or six thousand compatriots in Yan'an are holding an Anti-Japanese Rally here! Why do we link anti-Japanese with betraying the country? Because Wang Jingwei, who was previously known as the leader of the pro-Japanese faction, has now openly, according to recent news from various domestic and foreign news agencies, escaped from Chongqing privately, hiding from the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Government. He first fled to Kunming, and then from Kunming to Hanoi. In the first few days of his departure, fearing capture en route, he feigned illness and uttered deceptive lies. However, after publishing his telegram to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters on December 29 in Hong Kong and Guangzhou last year, Wang Jingwei's betrayal was completely exposed! What did Wang Jingwei say in his telegram to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters? He simply repeated the so-called "Basic Policy for Adjusting Relations between China and Japan" issued by the enemy Konoe on December 22 last year; at the same time, he shamelessly and openly stated that the National Government should immediately use the principles of the Konoe statement as a basis to exchange sincerity with the Japanese government in order to restore peace. What is the content of the "Basic Policy for Adjusting Relations between China and Japan" mentioned in the Konoe statement? It is the so-called "China, Japan, and Manchukuo will establish a new order in East Asia, mutual neighborliness, common anti-communism, and economic cooperation as common goals in the future." Wang Jingwei's proposal to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters is precisely to use the two principles of "harming neighbors, being friendly to Japan, jointly fighting communism, and economic cooperation" as the basis for peace talks. Because Wang Jingwei is merely a loudspeaker and echo of Konoe, as long as we refute the arrogance of the Konoe statement, we will completely refute the fallacies of Wang Jingwei's circular telegram. The most complete and powerful document refuting the Konoe statement is Chairman Chiang's instruction at the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Chongqing on December 26 last year. Chairman Chiang's historically significant instruction not only exposed all the enemy's conspiracies to destroy China thoroughly but also sentenced Wang Jingwei's December 29 circular telegram to death in advance.</p>
<p>(II) The So-Called New Order in East Asia Means the Destruction of China</p>
<p>Please listen to how Chairman Chiang refuted Konoe's ranting about the so-called "Establishment of a New Order in East Asia":</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said:</p>
<p>"The establishment of a 'New Order in East Asia' is the slogan and practice that the Japanese pride themselves on the most. According to the explanation of their Foreign Minister Arita on December 19, 'The New Order in East Asia means the close connection and mutual assistance of Japan, Manchukuo, and China in politics, economy, and culture to prevent the Red Menace, uphold Eastern civilization, remove economic barriers, and liberate China from a semi-colonial status to achieve stability in East Asia.' Konoe also said in his conversation on the 14th: 'The ultimate goal of the China Incident is not only military victory but also the rebirth of China and the establishment of a new order in East Asia. This new order is based on the cooperation of Japan, Manchukuo, and China after the rebirth of China.' Everyone should pay attention to the fact that the so-called reborn China is to eliminate independent China and create another enslaved China to be dominated by them for generations to come; and this new order is based on China becoming a slave state, closely linked with Japan and the 'puppet state of Manchukuo' created by them. What is the purpose? In the name of preventing the Red Menace, they control China's military; in the name of upholding Eastern civilization, they eliminate China's national culture; in the name of removing economic barriers, they exclude European and American forces and dominate the Pacific. Furthermore, with the tool of an 'economic unit' or 'economic group' of Japan, Manchukuo, and China, they control China's economic lifeline. Everyone, think about what kind of sinister intentions are hidden beneath the seven characters of 'Establishing a New Order in East Asia.' In simple terms, this is a general name for overthrowing the international order in East Asia, creating a slave China, and thus realizing their attempt to dominate the Pacific and control the world."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The so-called "New Order in East Asia" that the enemy talks about and thinks about is, first and foremost, a new order established on the basis of destroying and enslaving China.</p>
<p>What is the content of the so-called "neighborly friendship" that the enemy Konoe talks about and the so-called "good neighborly friendship" that Wang Jingwei talks about? This is the paragraph in Wang Jingwei's circular telegram that he particularly proudly says: "Japan has no territorial demands on China, no demands for war reparations. Japan not only respects China's sovereignty but will also, following the precedents of the Meiji Restoration, return concessions and abolish extraterritoriality under the condition of allowing freedom of residence and business in the mainland, so that China can fully achieve its independence." Chairman Chiang made a righteous and solemn exposure of the enemy's deceptive conspiracies and Wang Jingwei's clever sophistry in his instructions. Please listen to how Chairman Chiang refuted the enemy and the traitor's sweet words and cunning schemes that Japan has no territorial demands on China, no demands for war reparations, and will return concessions and abolish extraterritoriality! Chairman Chiang said:</p>
<p>"In his (i.e., the enemy's - author's note) mind, the so-called territory is naturally the territory he controls; resources are also the resources in his meaning. Since he has swept them away, why should he ask for any trivial territorial cessions and indemnities? What he asks for is the entire land and people. With great desires in front, he is naturally happy to use the cunning words of not wanting territory and not wanting compensation to deceive the world. In fact, from China's point of view, to talk about war compensation, we must first clarify the responsibility for the war. This time, it is clear that he launched troops to fight on our territory, and the responsibility for aggression is obvious to everyone. His statement is naturally not worth considering. As for extraterritoriality, if he controls China's entire sovereignty, then it is even the skin of the skin. The so-called returning concessions is like a rare commodity. Not only has his public opinion advocated managing the concessions of other countries on his behalf, but he wants to take back China's concessions and make them Japan's exclusive large concessions; and in fact, if China recognizes his 'New Order in East Asia' and the 'cooperation of Japan, Manchukuo, and China,' it will turn the entire territory of China into a large concession owned by Japan. In this way, if China does not become his slave state, it will also be reduced to a protectorate, and in fact, it will be merged into Japan. He says he wants to make China a completely independent country, isn't that just like Korea in the Treaty of Shimonoseki?"</p>
<p>(III) Chairman Chiang's Refutation is Righteous and Forceful</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The enemy obviously sent troops to occupy the entire Chinese territory, yet shamelessly says he has no territorial ambitions! The enemy obviously wants to occupy all of China's resources, so of course he doesn't need to talk about any compensation! At the same time, it is indeed true that Chairman Chiang said that if we talk about compensation, we want the enemy to compensate us for all war losses because the enemy started the war and the enemy should bear the actual responsibility for the war. Since the enemy is determined to destroy China and turn China into a Japanese colony, then what use is there for extraterritoriality and concessions! Chairman Chiang's refutation of the enemy and the traitor's request to allow the Japanese to have freedom of residence and business in the Chinese mainland is righteous, forceful, and sincere. Chairman Chiang said:</p>
<p>"In addition, he further proposes that China should grant Japanese citizens the right to freedom of residence and business in the mainland. This seems to be very ordinary, but he does not know what a deep and widespread impression the Chinese people have of the crimes committed by Japan in China in the past. To be honest, as soon as the Chinese people mention Japan, they will think of its intelligence agencies and the Japanese adventurers who do evil; they will think of selling opium, morphine, manufacturing heroin, selling heroin, gambling, prostitution, private arms trafficking, aiding bandits, raising hooligans, creating traitors, and all conspiracies to disrupt our order, corrupt our people's morals, poison us, and turn us into bandits. Therefore, opening up the mainland for freedom of residence and business can be discussed with other countries after China's legal and political systems are completely independent; but for Japan, unless our country is willing to be poisoned and disrupted by it, unless our country is willing to abandon the right to maintain law and order, unless we are willing to have our good customs corrupted by it, and our economic cream and blood sucked by it, no one will agree to it. The Japanese should not be forgetful. Isn't the so-called freedom of residence and business in the mainland the same as the so-called commercial and rental rights in the Northeast back then? When the current Foreign Minister Arita, in his capacity as the Director of the East Asia Bureau, came to Nanjing to negotiate at the behest of his cabinet Prime Minister Tanaka in the 18th year of the Republic of China, we resolutely refused and were unwilling to agree to this commercial and rental rights request. We would rather have them use military force to occupy our Northeast than sign this unequal treaty that would harm the country and betray its sovereignty. Why? Because the impression that Japan has given us is too terrible. Wherever they reside, the police power and economic power will be lost along with it. If the Japanese have freedom of residence and business, the Chinese in the same place will have no freedom, even to the point of not being able to stand their ground. The commercial and rental rights issue at that time was only a local matter in the corner of the Northeast, and we were still unwilling to agree to it. Now they have expanded it and extended it to our entire territory, and under the slogan of the so-called 'New Order in East Asia,' I ask my people if there is still any room for consideration?"</p>
<p>(IV) The So-Called Sino-Japanese Joint Anti-Communism is Actually Reducing China</p>
<p>What is the content of the "joint anti-communism" that the enemy and Wang Jingwei talk about? Chairman Chiang also made a clear exposure in his instructions. Please listen to how Chairman Chiang exposed the enemy and the traitor's conspiracy of the so-called "joint anti-communism"! Chairman Chiang said:</p>
<p>"We can say that it is only in the name of joint anti-communism that they first control our country's military, and then control our country's politics, culture, and even diplomacy. This is a major reason why they have been resentful for not succeeding in their previous requests before the July 7th Incident. Because we were unwilling to fall into their trap, we would rather endure all kinds of hardships, and at the final juncture, we would rather sacrifice the entire country to resist the war. If this joint anti-communism request could be agreed to, would we have to wait until today? The general opinion in the world may be that the so-called anti-communism by Japan is actually meant to prevent Soviet Russia; in fact, the purpose of Japan's so-called signing of an agreement for joint anti-communism is neither to prevent communism nor to prevent Russia, but to use this name to destroy China. Even if there is a meaning against Russia in it, it only accounts for a small part, and the greater part is to destroy China. Otherwise, if it were for national defense or truly for relations with Russia, then why did its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu Aoi, act so contemptibly and yield during the military conflict at Zhanggufeng in July and August this year? This shows that its so-called anti-communism to our country is just a cover to deceive the world and the people, and to seek a pretext to station troops in North China and Inner Mongolia from China. To be honest, if the stationing of troops in North China could be allowed and Inner Mongolia could be designated as a special zone, we would not have had the July 7th Incident."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The enemy and the traitor's so-called Sino-Japanese joint anti-communism is actually to destroy China, to completely place China's military, politics, economy, culture, and diplomacy under the control of the enemy, and to make China a Japanese slave state. At the same time, Chairman Chiang pointed out that the enemy and the traitor's purpose of so-called anti-communism, "even if there is a meaning against Russia in it, it only accounts for a small part, and the greater part is to destroy China." Chairman Chiang's instruction not only thoroughly exposed the enemy's false mask of joint anti-communism, but also gave a head-on blow to those confused people or those with ulterior motives who shouted wildly that "China's resistance is fighting for the Soviet Union" and disrupted the war effort.</p>
<p>(V) The So-Called Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation is Just a Replay of Japanese-Manchukuo Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>Finally, what is the content of the "economic cooperation" or "economic partnership" that the enemy and Wang Jingwei talk about? Chairman Chiang also made a clear exposure in his instructions. Please listen to how Chairman Chiang exposed the enemy and the traitor's conspiracy of the so-called "economic partnership" or "economic cooperation"! Chairman Chiang said:</p>
<p>"The so-called 'economic unit' and 'economic group' have been advocated by Japan for many years. Recently, this conspiracy is still being carried out vigorously. This is the main link in the 'East Asian Cooperative Body.' They are constantly changing slogans, sometimes calling it economic partnership, sometimes calling it economic cooperation, and their government's declaration on November 4 refers to it as 'economic ties.' At the end of November, Japanese newspapers published 'Japan, Manchukuo, and China will establish an economic unit and share weal and woe in the future'; then, on December 19, Arita said in a speech: 'Japan has decided to hold an economic conference to seek close integration of the Japanese, Manchukuoan, and Chinese economies and to strengthen the 'economic unit.'' This type of economic relationship is called an 'economic group' by the world. In fact, the 'North China Development' and 'Central China Revitalization' companies, which serve as tools for economic annexation, have already been established. Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic talks have been held more than once. Their so-called Planning Agency also formulated a 'Plan for Expanding the Productive Capacity of Japan, Manchukuo, and China' on the second day after the recent statement. This so-called economic group not only wants to control our country's customs and finance, monopolize our country's production and trade, and monopolize Asian hegemony, but gradually extend it to the point where they restrict our Chinese people's freedom in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and kill or spare us as they please, making the entire Chinese nation slaves, beasts of burden, and wiping out our nation's survival under their whips and sucking."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's words are completely correct. The actual content of the enemy and the traitor's so-called Sino-Japanese "economic partnership" or "economic cooperation" is the replay of the so-called "Japanese-Manchukuo economic cooperation" that the enemy has already implemented. Land, forests, mines, banks, railways, customs, taxes, and factories are occupied and controlled by the enemy. Internal and external commerce is monopolized by the enemy. The people's lives are plunged into deep water and hot fire and the miserable state of beasts of burden and slaves. This is the true situation that the enemy talks about, thinks about, and does in Korea, Taiwan, our Northeast provinces, and all occupied areas.</p>
<p>(VI) Spreading the Fallacy of Betraying National Policy at a Time of Urgent Resistance</p>
<p>Precisely because the true content of Konoe's statement is so sinister and vicious, Chairman Chiang estimated Konoe's statement in his instructions as "the enemy's entire self-confession of his arrogant conspiracy to annex China, dominate East Asia, and attempt to conquer the world, and also the exposure of the entire plan to destroy our country and exterminate our nation." After running away, Wang Jingwei actually copied a portion of Konoe's statement directly and disguised another portion cleverly as his own proposal to the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters. The Central Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang therefore decided to permanently expel Wang Zhaoming from the party and remove him from all positions. This is absolutely correct. Please listen to an important excerpt from the full text of the Chinese Kuomintang's resolution to expel Wang Jingwei from the party:</p>
<p>"Wang Zhaoming, bearing the heavy trust of this party, at a time of urgent resistance, left his post without authorization, hid in a foreign land, and spread the fallacy of betraying national policy. Recent telegrams even advocated using the enemy Prime Minister Konoe's fundamental and arrogant statement to destroy our country as a basis to seek peace with the enemy. On the one hand, he published it in newspapers for wide distribution, using the name of suggesting to the Central Government to show off his skills of swaying people's hearts. Moreover, the content of his telegram was everywhere artfully decorated for the enemy's demands, not hesitating to reverse right and wrong to speak for the enemy, and even going further to help them deceive the world. In terms of this action alone, it is purely seeking surrender by colluding with the enemy, and its impact is directly intended to shake the foundation of the country. Our country launched the War of Resistance for national salvation and survival. The deaths and injuries of more than a million soldiers and the sacrifices of millions of compatriots are all intended to fundamentally eliminate the enemy's poisonous plan of aggression and to permanently preserve the lives of our nation and generations to come. For more than a year, the people have united with sincerity, and the soldiers have bravely risked their lives. All people are united under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek of this party, determined and unyielding, with the confidence of certain victory. Now, the enemy's ambition to plot against us is becoming more apparent, and their tricks are becoming more vicious, which makes our national indignation even more intense and our determination even firmer. What Wang said is not only abhorred by the Central Government but also intolerable to the people of the whole country. It is found that during the war, any citizen must absolutely not violate the decision of the wartime national policy and determine his own position. The party's discipline absolutely does not allow exceeding the official resolutions of the party, violating the party's rules, and publishing his opinions as an individual. Wang Zhaoming's actions of violating discipline and endangering the party and the country are already obvious. Where righteousness lies, there can be no leniency. He is hereby permanently expelled from the party and removed from all positions to rectify party discipline and correct public opinion..."</p>
<p>I can say with complete certainty that not only the thousands of people attending the meeting today, not only the people from all walks of life in Yan'an, not only the nearly one million people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, but also the 400 million compatriots in the whole of China and all just people in the world warmly support President Chiang Kai-shek's speech refuting Konoe's statement and unanimously support the Chinese Kuomintang's resolution to permanently expel Wang Jingwei from the party. Since the publication of the circular telegram on December 29 last year, Wang Jingwei, from the position of leader of the pro-Japanese faction, is not only forever unqualified to be a member of the Kuomintang but also forever unqualified to be a citizen of the Republic of China! Therefore, we not only vehemently support the Kuomintang's resolution to expel Wang Jingwei from the party but also wish to see the National Government issue a decree to strip Wang Jingwei of his citizenship. Therefore, the telegram from front-line generals Chen Cheng, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, He Pan, Wei Lihuang, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Li Hanhun, Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua, and Long Ling calling for a public arrest warrant for Wang Jingwei, and the proposals from local governments and Kuomintang party headquarters at home and abroad calling for punishing Wang Jingwei with national law will surely be responded to and supported by the compatriots attending the meeting today and the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>(VII) Wang Jingwei's Behavior of Flattering the Enemy and Surrendering is Not Accidental</p>
<p>Comrades! People from all walks of life!</p>
<p>Economic Column</p>
<h3>The Sterling Revolution and Its Impact</h3>
<p>London is the capital of the world's gold market and the center of international finance. This superior position has historically given the pound sterling its leading status in the world currency market. However, this status may now become one of the major factors trampling on the pound. Because world gold prices have soared due to the war preparations of various countries, the pound, held back by the exchange rate umbrella, has been unable to keep pace. This is tantamount to a fall in the domestic value of the pound. In addition, the British Treasury has turned from surplus to deficit in recent years, and foreign trade and international balance of payments have all shown deficits. The external value of the pound itself is also severely weakened. How can it withstand this kind of pressure from the rising gold prices?</p>
<p>Recently, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Simon, has requested the Parliament to revalue the reserve value of the Bank of England and decided to estimate it once a week according to the market price. The income generated from the valuation will be used as a foreign exchange fund. As for the bank's banknote issuance quota, he requested it to be reduced from 400 million pounds to 300 million pounds, and this would be fixed without increase or decrease.</p>
<p>This approach is indeed a major revolution in the British monetary system. The Bank of England's reserves have been calculated according to a statutory price of 85 shillings per ounce, and this has never changed in more than 200 years. Now, not only is this statutory price abandoned, but it is also estimated once a week according to the market price. Therefore, the higher the gold price, the greater the value of British reserves or foreign exchange funds, which can naturally make the position of the pound more solid. The London Times called this approach the "market price gold standard," which is poised to become a brand-new term in modern currency science.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bank of England's banknote issuance has always increased or decreased according to the amount of cash reserves. If the reserve amount is estimated according to the market price, and the gold price continues to rise today, the banknote issuance is bound to increase. With increased banknote issuance, gold prices will naturally be affected by the increased currency supply and rise. Therefore, now it has been decided that the total amount of banknote issuance should not exceed 200 million pounds. Thus, the total amount of issuance has become fixed, while the issuance reserve amount, conversely, is shifted by the price of gold to determine the amount of banknote issuance, which is the opposite of before. This is truly a new revolution for the pound.</p>
<p>What impact will this revolution have on gold prices and exchange rates in the future? In our view, it can generally stabilize the soaring gold prices and the weakening pound exchange rate for a while.</p>
<p>Because the Bank of England's banknote issuance has now been reduced to 300 million, it can first benefit from contracting the currency supply, strengthening the pound and suppressing gold prices. Moreover, the revaluation directly strengthens the foreign exchange fund and indirectly enhances Britain's financial credibility. The position of the pound can naturally be expected to improve. As a result, those who doubt the pound and rush to buy gold can be reduced, and the speculative fever in the gold market can naturally be reduced. Therefore, the London gold market should be able to stabilize temporarily.</p>

<h3>St. Joseph's Relentless Attack, Eliminated by Police, 4-3 Police Win Silver Shield Final Right, Group B Scots Eliminate Public Works Bureau 7-2</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Special] Yesterday, the only Senior Division football match in the city was the special Silver Shield single act between the Police and St. Joseph's, which was staged at the Navy Ground. Hundreds of Chinese and Western spectators attended, and the scene was not too deserted. After ninety minutes of competition between the two teams, the score was still tied at 3-3, and the winner was not decided. The war god then extended his stay for another twenty minutes, giving a final opportunity for the two teams to settle this football account. As a result, the Police, relying on six points of luck and four points of personnel, unexpectedly had the originally worst-performing Moore score a valuable goal at the moment the overtime match was about to end, ending Joseph's life and completing this victory with a score of 4-3, winning the final right. Most spectators initially thought Joseph's would not fail, but the facts were the opposite, and thus there was such an ending.</p>
<p>The reason for Joseph's defeat was not related to individual skills. What shortcomings were not as good as the Police that led to them deserving to lose? The most fatal blow was that in the second half, when they held a 3-2 advantage, Ha Xian suffered a foot injury and withdrew and then re-entered, his movements were not agile, and he reluctantly played, forcing the central defender to change to the stone wing, and Si Ma Kwei Shi was transferred to the right inner midfielder to support the team's important stronghold at that time, namely Da Gao Shan Nu, and acted as the central defender, replacing Ha Xian. However, the attacking power of the front line was weakened due to this adjustment. The absence of Bi Lu Du due to illness was also a pity. If he had participated, this change might not have occurred. However, the number of successes or failures is not only related to the participation of the players. Moreover, to be defeated by the Police, whose strength was originally not as good as their own, the reasons must be complicated. However, the Police players became more and more courageous as they fought, which was enough to put the injured and defeated Joseph's in a bitter battle, and their morale was greatly affected, and they had to abandon the city and flee.</p>
<p>Joseph's, in the previous replay, had Da Gao Shan Nu, Bi Lu Du, Lei Mi Di and other players exert their strength, and the lineup was renewed, eliminating the invincible Navy and being promoted to a higher level, with great ambition. They were confident that they would capture the Police in one fell swoop in the semi-final, and hoped to win the championship one day. How did they know that man's plans are not as good as Heaven's plans, and they were defeated by the Police, and their efforts were abandoned halfway, and all previous efforts were in vain. This unending hatred, to whom to tell? It also shows that this championship cannot be won entirely by relying on people, and in addition to manpower, it also depends on luck.</p>
<p>The four goals won by the Police were half created by chance. For example, the second goal was a penalty kick, and the fourth goal was scored by Moore because Ma Kwei Shi's vision was blocked. Therefore, their current half-championship is due to luck. In terms of their actual strength, they are very ordinary. They have overcome the difficulties yesterday, and they don't know how many lives they have cultivated. However, they do not have the appearance of a champion, and they do not seem to be one. When they compete with the winner of South China against Eastern for the championship, it is敢 to be concluded that the champion seat does not belong to them.</p>
<p>In this match, the three Chinese players in the Police lineup all made very good contributions. Compared with the Western players, they were much more outstanding. Left inner midfielder Chen Guang Ge had enough power in his feet and defended tightly. Da Gao Shan Nu stumbled forward several times when he encountered him. Huang Wen Gui played the most brilliantly in the second half, and Pa Ni La and Su Sha were repeatedly threatened and felt quite a headache. Fan Gui Cai was also good. Among the Western players, Pa Jia was considered good at exerting his strength. Although Hou Lu Moore did not have any good points to show, both of them gained something, and their merits cannot be ignored. In short, the Police's ability to win was mostly due to luck.</p>
<p>In the Group B Silver Shield semi-final, Scots eliminated the Public Works Bureau 7-5. Scots and Mi Du both won the right to the final. The situation of the Group A match is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Police)</p>
<p>Mai Ha Di</p>
<p>Chen Guangyu Bi Li Ban</p>
<p>Nuo Fu Bi Li Dun Pa Jia</p>
<p>Moore Hou Lu Fan He Hua He Ya Huang Wen Gui</p>
<p>(St. Joseph's)</p>
<p>Ma Kwei Shi</p>
<p>Su Sha Lei Mi Di</p>
<p>Pa Ni La Ha Xian Jia Shi Di Lu</p>
<p>Ya Lu Yu Shi Jin Shi Li An Na Da Gao Shan Nu Si Ma Yi Shi</p>
<p>As soon as the war started, the Police took the offensive. Fan Gui Cai and Hou Lu showed their power one after another, and Mai Ha Di received them all. However, Joseph's then attacked the goal twice. Although they failed to break through, the Police defenders were already quite surprised.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after the start of the game, Huang Wen Gui got the ball and advanced rapidly along the side, deep into the hinterland, and then passed it to Fan Gui Cai, who shot it into the goal, scoring the first point. Afterwards, the Police lost several winning opportunities due to the abnormal performance of left winger Moore.</p>
<p>Soon, Joseph's forwards became active. Jin Shi dribbled the ball and chased after the attack, but was released by Mai Ha Di, resulting in a corner kick. Si Ma Kwei Shi opened the kick with an excellent landing point, and Da Gao Shan Nu greeted the ball with his head, as fast as a shooting star, and thus tied the score at 1-1.</p>
<p>After Joseph's won back a goal, his momentum was overwhelming for a while. Da Gao Shan Nu and Li An Na were like butterflies穿花, repeatedly threatening the Police. Lei Mi Di consolidated the rear, as solid as a golden soup. On the other hand, the Police's center line was weak, and the left wing士was even more overshadowed. Hou Lu, Fan Gui Cai, and Huang Wen Gui had no chance to use their skills. Soon, the Police's two defenders entangled Li An Na, causing Ya Lu Yu Shi to shoot diagonally without defense, and the ball went into the net, and Joseph's took the lead with a 2-1 victory. After another short battle, the first half ended.</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting, Huang Wen Gui of the Police showed his brilliance, and with Hou Yu's strong assaults, the area in front of Joseph's goal was in trouble again. Still, Lei Mi Di defended his territory well and was not calculated. After a while, 律迎頭頂球, Lei Mi Di rushed to grab it, Hou Lu was blocked and fell to the ground, and Joseph's was fined a penalty kick, which was kicked by Moore and entered the goal in one fell swoop. At this point, both sides tied the score again at 2-2.</p>
<p>Seven minutes later, Joseph's gained the advantage of a corner kick. Si Ma Kwei Shi passed the ball to the center point, and Jin Shi shot it in nearby, and Joseph's won again with a 3-2 lead. After the Police lost, they tried harder. Huang Wen Gui single-handedly rushed past the opponent's rear defense line, but unfortunately Fan Gui Cai and Hou Lu were entangled, and no one responded. At this time, Ha Xian injured his foot, went out and then re-entered, and the formation was slightly changed. One attack and one defense were thus affected. Soon, Huang Wen Gui forced Su Sha back again and cut the ball in. Hou Lu took advantage of the situation and kicked it in, and tied the score again at 3-3. After that, the Joseph's forwards all held the idea of breaking the boat. Li An Na, Da Gao Shan Nu, and Ya Lu Yu Shi attacked blatantly, causing danger in the Police's hinterland. Fortunately, Chen Guangyu slashed and fought bravely against the incoming generals, turning danger into safety. Until the end of the game, the winner was still not decided, and the referee extended the game time by twenty minutes.</p>
<p>After the restart, Ha Xian and Si Ma Kwei Shi had twice forced the goal, but both were saved by Mai Ha Di.迫至最後兩分鐘, Hou Lu dribbled the ball quickly, and Lei Mi Di accidentally lost his footing. Hou Lu passed the ball to the center line again, and Moore shot from close range. Ma Si Kwei Shi's vision was blocked and he could not accurately see the direction of the ball, and he扑一個空, too late to save it, and Joseph's unfortunate fate was thus doomed. As a result, the Police sang a triumphant song with a score of 4-3.</p>

<h3>Movies During Wartime</h3>
<p>Entertainment...Triangle Love</p>
<p>Three Loves Has Nancy</p>
<p>This is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. The film features witty and humorous dialogue, a lot of laughter, vivid performances by the actors, and a very interesting love story with four corners, making the film a very perfect and entertaining comedy.</p>
<p>The content tells the story of a country girl who goes to a big city to find her fiancé, causing a lot of jokes. Later, how did she and a writer and a publisher of this writer's work, in a special situation, have a crazy and闹鬧love story?</p>
<p>This film captures a segment of modern urban life and develops it very brightly. The director, Richard Thorpe, has very rich experience in handling comedies. Not only does he create an extremely humorous style for the whole film, but also every shot is full of a strong humorous interest, and every inch of film makes the audience have no chance to stop laughing. Nancy, who plays the country girl in the film, shows a very lovely personality. She vividly portrays the pure, naive heart of a rural girl and her trusting attitude towards urban friends. She is the most outstanding character in the film. The performances of Gary Cooper as the writer and Frank Morgan as the publisher are also wonderful and excellent. This film can be said to be their first collaboration and a successful work.</p>
<p>Queen...Good Doctor Love</p>
<p>A Man To Remember</p>
<p>For audiences who like movies with beautiful stories, this film is the most ideal work. The film depicts the life of a country doctor, a history of failures, successes, sorrows, and honors. It uses a retrospective way to develop various scenes, and tells how the doctor served the society and the poor masses with a spirit of sacrifice for twenty years as if it were one day. At the same time, the film also unambiguously exposes the selfish and shameful state of the villains in society.</p>
<p>Edward Arnold plays a doctor with no degree but with great talent and ability in the film. With a selfless spirit of serving the people, he takes his young son back to his hometown. However, those who dare to trust him are only some poor farmers. The reward he gets is only some agricultural products. In one medical consultation, the harvest he gets is the baby girl he just delivered. He continues to struggle without discouragement, and educates his son to get a very high degree. But what disappoints him is that this son only pursues false reputation and money. Fortunately, he has the adopted daughter as his only help and comfort. In the end, he uses his foresight to save the children of the whole village from a dangerous infectious disease, and only then does he receive the warm respect and love of the whole village.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple, who plays the doctor's adopted daughter, also gives an excellent performance.</p>
<p>At the same time, the latest "March of Time" newsreel will be shown. The film has a very detailed narration and incisive analysis of the internal and external causes and effects of Hitler's seizure of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Ping An...Saving the Tide</p>
<p>The Storm</p>
<p>This film writes about the unrestrained life of some seafarers. The director handles several tense scenes and climaxes in the film quite movingly. Charles Farrell plays a ship radio operator who causes trouble everywhere. How does he fight bravely for his beloved brother, and in the end, in the storm, help his sister-in-law save his brother's life. This film vividly depicts how the life of the crew on board, how they play the occasion, and how they perform their duties conscientiously. The performances of the actors show a kind of irritable and barbaric character, and their fighting, making trouble, getting drunk, flirting, and gambling are all vivid and energetic.</p>
<p>Eastern...The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</p>
<p>Tfhe Adventures o Tom Sawyer</p>
<p>This popular masterpiece by the great American writer Mark Twain has been produced once before. Perhaps some people can still remember the excellent acting skills of the child star Missy Green. This version, dyed in color, makes the scenery of the countryside extraordinarily vivid. The performances of the two child stars, Tommy Kelly and Ann Gillis, are also very moving. Tommy Kelly fully demonstrates that he is a promising actor--as long as he has a suitable script.</p>
<p>The movie is very long, but because of the director's superb skills, the tone is always light and smooth, and people do not feel that there is any slackness in it. This film can be regarded as a top-notch work for turning a literary work into a movie.</p>
<p>May Robson, who plays the grandmother, is also worth mentioning, although she has few scenes.</p>
<p>Da Hua...Double Wedding</p>
<p>Donble Wedding</p>
<p>William Powell and Myrna Loy have been paired for a long time, and they have always given us a very good impression. Of course, many people like their movies, and this film is also very successful, although the plot is not particularly outstanding.</p>

<p>Central...Dream Tour Wonderland</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>Adapted from "Mirror緣", but further than "金花緣", the whole drama is based on Xin Ma Shuizeng as the starting point, describing Xin Ma, who is originally a tea shop waiter, one night in a dream he saw the Star of Longevity, so the Star of Longevity took him to various places to play, such as Nantianmen, Beitianmen, 大人國, Lilliput, etc., so that he had a strange miracle that he had never seen before, watching this film, really just think that you are dreaming,</p>
<p>The whole play from beginning to end, scattered and abnormal, the plot has no central point, I believe that progressive audiences, will not welcome such a film, the songs sung are still a few old songs,</p>
<p>Taiping...Four King Brothers</p>
<p>Mandarin Film</p>
<p>From silent film to sound film, from monochrome to color, materially this remake of the film is much more advanced, the male lead is Wang Yin, the female lead is a new comer Zhang Cui Fen, the scene is great, is its progress,</p>

<h3>The Illusionist</h3>
<p>— Xuan Bing</p>
<p>I remember seeing many people in theaters or at some meeting places, dressed in bizarre costumes, wearing humorous faces, holding a piece of cloth and a deck of playing cards, performing their illusions to the public, turning cigarettes out of a cloth, changing one card from the deck to another; with all kinds of endless variations, they seem like omnipotent gods, wanting this, they have this, wanting that, they have that.</p>
<p>But some illusionists probably know that the audience knows that what they are performing is fake, so before performing their "magic powers," they say a few opening remarks, saying "If you can see it, your eyes are fast. If you can't see it, my hands are fast." This kind of self-acknowledged illusion is fake, is deceptive, naturally, the audience who hears these words, even the most foolish people, know that what he is playing with is not real but illusory, but some illusionists insist on showing off their "magic powers," not only do they not say that what they are going to perform is fake, but even the name that contains the meaning of the technique they are going to perform—illusion—this "illusion" character is deliberately mysteriously explained in a set of deceptive explanations.</p>
<p>This naturally cannot deceive people with self-confidence and strong consciousness, but it will greatly deceive people with unstable consciousness and weak faith.</p>
<p>When I encountered this situation, his explanation naturally could not deceive me, but, I looked at the people around me, and there were many people who were "deceived," and the "deceived" people were not necessarily women and children, even those who were neatly dressed and looked like celebrities and scholars nodded and acquiesced to his explanation, and after his performance, they greatly praised it, saying, "How can such a performance be fake. Where did this thing come from, can this cloth hide so many things?" This kind of self-deception, believing that these performances must be real.</p>
<p>Sitting close to these people who were deceived and still did not know it, I received so much laughing material, besides exchanging a knowing smile with my friend, and on the way home after watching this play, when I was bored, I would also use it as talking material and make a lot of discussions!</p>
<p>But, when I sat quietly and bored, and accidentally thought of this matter, besides feeling that a group of fools were being deceived pitifully, I would go a step further; I felt that everything I came into contact with in life was mostly "close to this," as small as a corner of society that I came into contact with in my personal life, as large as the complex changes in international politics, none were not like this, but their means of performance were more sophisticated and their faces were more solemn.</p>
<p>Like these years, it is the time when illusionists are in full swing to show off their magical powers, some are today in this tall building, magically creating an agreement document, and tomorrow they are magically creating a deal to abolish the agreement, if they get a bargain, they will greet people with a smile, if their demands are not met, they will slap the table and scold people, these pretenses are nothing more than means of fighting for profit, that is, illusion is performing.</p>
<p>Not to mention the distant ones, and not to mention other things for the time being, let's take our eastern neighbor's "signature play" performed a few months ago, the prime minister personally came on stage, holding a sun flag, waving it up and down, and then smiling and magically creating a declaration written with the words "peace and happiness," which led a group of celebrities from our country to applaud and marvel, believing it to be true, and responding to it, causing a storm in the city. However, as the environment changed and the days passed, the performer at that time stepped down, and another one was replaced who was the same advocate of peace as his predecessor; he said that the previous Mr. Peace Declaration was just playing on the stage, and the things on the stage will no longer exist after stepping down, after saying these opening remarks, he is going to start starring in her "signature" play.</p>
<p>This only gave the people who were deceived and still said it was true, and whose will was not firm and whose faith was weak, the greatest blow.</p>
<h3>Year-End</h3>

<p>Climb, climb. Desperately climbing along with the days, climb, climb, climb to the year-end, ah, is the year-end a difficult hurdle?</p>
<p>The year-end is ten thousand iron whips, exhausting all the "magic weapons" is not easy to get through! Difficult and painful things are always tightly entangled with the desperate. The wife shouts at her husband for money, the ignorant child twists his father to make new clothes. How do they know the difficulties of being a man? The unfeeling landlord, because it is the year-end, does not understand people's difficulties, and even increases their rent, and fiercely demands the old debts!</p>
<p>Climb, climb, after suffering enough, you still have to climb, climb, climb, climb, climb to the foot of the mountain, climb to the year-end, no, climb to the difficult hurdle, ah, climb to the difficult hurdle!</p>
<h3>War and Peace</h3>
<p>— You Di</p>
<p>Peace, peace, now some people are wearing the cloak of peace, covering up their true faces of betrayal—however, they will never be able to tarnish the sacred flower of peace.</p>
<p>The pro-Japanese traitors who advocate peace open their mouths and say: "Is there any war that doesn't want peace?" It is true that peace is the end of war. War is bloody politics, and politics is bloodless war. War ends and peace reappears. It can be said that peace is the negation of war; and the "quantitative change" to "qualitative change" of war is the whole process from war to peace. But peace is not something that pro-Japanese traitors who advocate peace can seek casually!</p>
<p>When war reaches a certain stage, peace will inevitably come. At this time, one side of the belligerent group has completely achieved its political goals by force, and the other side has failed, the reason is: war is a sharp conflict of political (economic) contradictions between two groups, this contradiction is expressed in a special political form (force) to resolve it, and the resolution of this contradiction is the arrival of peace.</p>
<p>The political purpose of our anti-Japanese war is to drive out the national enemy, fight for national liberation, and establish a democratic republic." The political purpose of the Japanese invaders is to monopolize and enslave China, and to completely colonize China. This political (economic) contradiction led to the war. The prospect of this war is: we will use the power of the entire nation to drive the enemy to the Yalu River, and after achieving this political goal, peace will come! But if necessary, we plan to assist the revolutionary movement in Korea, and the result of the war will inevitably lead to a revolution among the Japanese people, then China's anti-Japanese war is to strive for true peace.</p>
<p>Understanding this explanation of peace, all the pro-Japanese traitors' arguments for peace cannot exist! The pro-Japanese traitors' arguments for peace is to seek peace without choice, he demands peace now, may I ask if we can achieve our political goals! No! Ten thousand times no, they not only think that restoring the state before the July 7th Incident can bring peace, but also think that this is a futile high-profile, but their arguments are planned for the Japanese, because the enemy's political goals can be smoothly achieved through the hands of these pro-Japanese traitors!</p>
<p>Therefore, if someone asks, "When will the war end, when will peace come," we should immediately answer him, we will stop the war only after achieving the political goal of national liberation and establishing a "democratic republic", specifically speaking, is to drive the enemy to the Yalu River, the pro-Japanese traitors' arguments for peace say, "Going to Tokyo to fight is peace" This is nonsense that cannot even deceive children!</p>
<h3>Night in the Cattle Shed</h3>
<p>— Peng Chenghui</p>
<p>The night is quiet, everything is quiet.</p>
<p>In this remote village, as soon as the sky turns dark, every household closes its doors. Between the fields and the wilderness, everything is quietly resting in the night. It is winter now, the days are short, the sky turns dark especially easily, because there is no moon or starlight, and the weather is cold, it seems particularly desolate outside.</p>
<p>Outside the village houses, there are many bonfires burning cow dung, garbage, and rice stalks, emitting an unpleasant smell, rising thick black smoke, and the firelight flickers in the dark from time to time, sometimes accompanied by one or two sharp, slight explosions.</p>
<p>From the neighboring village at the foot of the opposite mountain. There are occasional deep barks of dogs. In the windows of the thatched houses, small lights leak out, flickering on and off. Although it is still early, everywhere is a scene of silence and desolation. Since the fall of Huizhou, bandits have been rampant, and the people here close their doors even earlier. As soon as the smoke rises from the kitchen, there are very few pedestrians on the road.</p>
<p>On the edge of this small village, there is a small house made of mud bricks, the roof is all covered with thatch, and in front of the door stands an old longan tree, with a few stone benches scattered underneath. This small house is a cattle shed for water buffalo to rest in, and at this time there are three cowherds, embracing a black hard broken quilt, lying on an old bed together. Two tall water buffalo are lying in the dark corner, munching on dry grass.</p>
<p>They are very excited at this time, having beautiful dreams, fantasizing about the world on Feie Ridge. Tomorrow, yes, tomorrow. They can participate in their activities. Da Hei, who returned from the front line, once told them how interesting the guerrillas are. In the overlapping mountains, they ambush at night, detour and attack, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and can often rob many military supplies from the Japanese: telescopes, leather coats, and copper helmets, leather boots and guns. Holding live ammunition in the dark night, shouting orders, is so majestic. Blowing military bugles in the morning and evening and singing patriotic songs in their spare time is so happy. They have also heard the teacher in the school tell stories about many young soldiers under Zhao Lao Tai Tai. The shadow of the "little hero" flashes in their minds from time to time. They are the three most mischievous children in the countryside, and they usually like to play with dirt and fight Mauser guns. Now that they have the opportunity to play with machine guns and box cannons, you can imagine how fascinated they are!</p>
<p>"At this time tomorrow, aren't we sleeping on Feie Ridge?" The smallest one is always looking forward to the scene tomorrow night.</p>
<p>"That's great! Do you think it's as carefree as when you go up the mountain to herd cattle? When you're a soldier, you have to fight all the time!" After all, the bigger one thinks more carefully.</p>
<p>"Even if you're having such dreams, whether they're willing to take us in is still a problem!" The biggest one thinks the most thoroughly.</p>
<p>"If they don't take us in, there's no reason for that!" The smaller one is confident.</p>
<p>"That's right! Didn't the teacher in the school tell us that in the past, the guerrillas accepted both big and small!" The bigger one also feels very confident.</p>
<p>"Haha, box cannons, machine guns, we'll have them to play with tomorrow night." The smaller one is almost ecstatic, reaching out and pinching the bigger one's thigh.</p>
<p>"Play, play, play, I'm afraid that when you hear the Japanese artillery, you'll be so scared that you'll shit your pants!" The bigger one taunts him.</p>
<p>"People's cells are not small, in the future you will know my ability when you see me killing Japanese devils." He is still very proud of himself.</p>
<p>"Hey, let's go to bed early, we have to hurry tomorrow morning!" The bigger one seriously makes this suggestion.</p>
<p>"Good, let's sleep!" The smaller one agrees very much. With a forceful pull on the quilt, all three heads shrink inside the quilt.</p>
<p>Although they are determined to sleep, they are still chatting with each other in the quilt. The god of sleep seems to be avoiding them everywhere, and beautiful dreams are always jumping on their meninges. The night outside is even quieter, and even the intermittent barking of dogs is gone. Everything in the world seems to be in a sweet sleep in the dark night. Finally, they finally slipped into the sweet land of sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, the sun shone brightly on this small village. As the three cowherds, carrying their bags, marched towards the mountain path leading to Feie Ridge, a commotion of children disappearing was taking place in this small village.</p>
<h3>"Chengdu Poet Symposium"</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>One of the trends in the Chengdu literary world</p>
<p>That was around July last year.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, several poets have come to Chengdu one after another, plus a few who originally lived in the local area and had a longer writing history, there are at least twenty people.</p>
<p>However, although there are quite a few people; but, until then, they did not interact with each other much, let alone organize any groups.</p>
<p>However, can this situation be allowed to continue? The answer is of course no. Therefore, as a result of the initiation and efforts of several friends, the only poetry group here - the New Poetry Society - was finally officially announced in July.</p>
<p>Then, we held several meetings in succession, discussed many poetry issues, and also set a lot of work plans.</p>
<p>Regarding the various problems of poetry at the present stage, although among the colleagues, in the past, even the styles and opinions of some people were completely different; but, at present, under the general goal of making poetry serve the War of Resistance, it can be said that everyone's opinions no longer have any conflicts and contradictions.</p>
<p>But, speaking of work, it is really embarrassing to say, not only did we not do the work we had planned to do, but, soon, even the group itself fell into a state of unusual slack and dispersion.</p>
<p>Looking back now, there are probably two reasons for this:</p>
<p>First, initially, we planned to publish a poetry journal, but, due to various reasons, it was never realized, which greatly reduced the interest of many colleagues and their concern for the group.</p>
<p>Second, some of the colleagues scattered. For example, Xia Zhi Lin, He Qifang, etc. going to northern Shaanxi, all affected the subjective strength of the group's activities in a tangible and intangible way.</p>
<p>However, can this situation be allowed to continue forever? The answer is still no.</p>
<p>Therefore, not long ago, this group finally reorganized and revived. - Implemented reorganization, and for various reasons, changed the name of the group to "Poet Symposium."</p>
<p>Currently, still a symposium, has appeared in the literary and art circles here in a brand-new posture and style, and has begun a blitzkrieg of work.</p>
<p>First of all, we started to widely solicit members, and widely develop the organization to the masses of all classes. In the future, famous poets will only be a small part of our group's composition, and the most important component will be young people who have only just started writing poetry, or are in the process of starting, or even just have an unusually strong interest in poetry. Because we believe that: this approach, in "this time and this place", is completely necessary; and, only in this way, can we truly make the new poetry movement widely unfold, and lay a mass foundation.</p>
<p>Regarding the work, the following items are currently in progress:</p>
<p>First, hold poetry evenings or recitals... It has been decided to hold one in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Second, publish publications... The symposium has started to compile a single-volume poetry publication for the Basha Bookstore here (similar to the "Pioneer" published in Shanghai before the war). This publication will be published after the lunar New Year. The first book, in addition to the works of local poets, also includes the works of authors from Kunming, Chongqing and other places, in addition to this, we are also preparing to attach a supplement (approximately weekly in nature) to the local newspaper.</p>
<p>Third, we are also preparing to regularly send people to various schools, groups, and gatherings to give lectures related to poetry.</p>
<p>Currently, those who are working most diligently for the group include Deng Junwu, Cao Baohua, Fang Jing, Ye Filuo,... and others.</p>
<p>In short, although this poetry group is still very small at present, and is still just starting to work; but, it will assume the tasks it should assume for the poetry movement in the rear and for the construction of anti-Japanese poetry!</p>
