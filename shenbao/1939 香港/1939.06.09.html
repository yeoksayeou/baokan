<h3 id="c1">襄樊前綫訪李司令長官 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>在襄樊的時候，第五戰區政治部主任韋承成先生領我們去參觀該地軍民俱樂部，一切民衆敎育，軍事常識的圖解說明，民衆　樂……等等都佈置得有條有理。其設備之週全，管整之完美，决非後方人士想像中近接火線地　所可能有的，第九戰區的文化工作的確有燦爛的特彩。可是有一點還須要我們後方朋友們多多　他以協助，那就是文化食糧問題。他們所有的善籍雜誌，報紙多半皆是幾。以前的東西，所以盼切地，望各地文化界收集一點比較優秀的書報郵寄軍郵第三十二局轉政治部韋先生收可也。前線與後方文化工作的對比，的確太不平衛了，我們時常高呼武裝頭腦和精神動員。可是這一切都是須要精神的糧食培養的。</p>
<p>在襄樊一共勾留了三夜，這位馳聘於漢水湖畔的百勝將軍李司令長官精神十分興奮煥發，他對於零個警局以及漢水流域一線的戰事，抱著萬二分的樂親。這先生的談吐十分有趣，任何嚴重的問題，經過了他的口，立即便可成為輕鬆明白，而易　解的『隨便談談』了。他認為退出武漢後的五六個月中，×人用了極大的犧牲了九牛二虎之力，求得不上百　的進展，共戰略上的原因是×人自主力進入武漢之後，皖鄂贛邊境幾　為我軍克復，　漢三　廣陷於四面包圍的苦境中，李先生舉例來說『好比一個自己陷於泥途的人，等到深及胸口的時候，當然會感到呼吸不易，極度危難的樣子，因此便想竭力推開前面的威脅，可是，那裏知道，他還不及鬆手，新的壓迫己更重更密地加之於身上了』。現在兩隻大（蟹的兩隻大腿）儘管稍有伸進，然其身體則格外受壓迫而陷於更深的死境，李司令長官對於日本軍　的前途很堅决地深信祇有所謂多行不義必自斃，日本帝國主義必然步一九一四年世界大戰的覆　自取滅亡而已。</p>
<p>談話中講到安南問題，李先生有義十分深遠超越的　解這是一般政論家和國際問團專家們所從未指出過的。他覺得安南的安危要關係到法國的　個戰略和政略，因為在軍事上一旦安南失守則法國在遠東沒有了據點，在政治上講，×人（日本）佔　安南必然會利用安南人出來組織政府，並假之以獨立的美名，這　一來自然是給其他許多殖民地一個刺激的榜樣。所以，從日本帝國主義佔領海南島之後，安南所處的地位實是危急非凡。至於轉危為安的辦法倒並不價難。而所需要的，祇是中法兩國在遠東有極密切的結合就是了。中國並無取心安南的野心，這一點是法國當局所可價信的。有了價個基本的信念之後，中法在安南的合作自然易辦了。李先生以為法國如果希望在戰爭中從歐洲以軍需品接濟安南那是十分靠不住的，而妥善的準備：第一，在安南須設立能製造輕武器及彈藥等工廠，第二，一切食粮與壯丁問題皆可先和中國有某種口頭上或文字十的默約，因為這是中法兩國在實際上合作的最好辦法，中國對於壯丁和食粮頗不成問題，法國對於十萬八萬軍火自然也不是難事，所以目前只要法國能眞正感覺到保障安南的必要，而給中國一種示意的話，我們當然可以於一旦必要的時候帮他們的忙。李司令長官談話生動的地方就在於能舉例，打　倣，在這裏他同樣地舉了一個例子：『中國人好像一個窮人，有時卽使是好意而走近富人，然而有　的法國總存實深怕措油或借債，其實這個窮人倒的確不是等閒之輩，有骨氣，有辦法非但不想揩人家的油，並且還打算盡量設法以濟人之急。雖然我們懷著滿腔熱情的好意，可是門第不當，又無自吿奮勇能幹的媒人。所以這場婚事終未成就，遠東太平洋上的風雲却已日趨惡劣矣。』同時，我們中國的民　性是世界上最講信義的·朋友間的銀錢，以及許多商業上的來往除了口頭上的所謂「一言為定」之外很少需要合同條約的，對方亦决不會因　訂合同或無書面的證件而謂約，因此，如果法國果有誠意並且能深切了解這位窮人的話，那末卽使沒有什麽正式外交上的條約，就是有了一句較為明朗懇切的話，我們也作點準備。李蒙則以為法國政府對安南尙為許多的顧忌，第一，工廠開得太多了，工人必然增加，因此便怕引起社會問題。第二，與中國過親近，又怕安南人學中國人的樣，而發動自由獨立的運動，以至釀成民族問題。對於這兩點，如果眞正是法政府的顧忌的話，我認為法國自己還不了解安南，諸位的意見怎樣？</p>
<p>次日，往隆中，這是『我本是臥龍崩散淡的人』諸葛亮的茅　古蹟·劉玄德曾三　茅廬請出這位羽扇綸巾一輪車，似仙似神的朋友來。現在成為靑年學生集訓地，以培養促進湖北政治和戰區民衆運動新力量的洪爐，願此地再有千百個諸葛亮在內。</p>
<p>四月七日晨離襄樊囘宣昌，一路皆為三國時代的名戰場，常陽橋，長坂坡，關墳——。可惜我的筆太粗太拙，否則眞想為篇畏坂坡憤趙子龍，雖然是否有多大的意義却很難說，可是他當年七進七出　兵的重圍，單槍匹馬，雄武英偉，那種不可一世的氣魄是極討人歡喜的。</p>
<p>由宜昌而沙市，橫渡洞庭潤到長沙，因交通困難，加以陪四位外國朋友，走來競為疲困，到長沙後，就得立卽展開陣地當夜十二時才眠，次晨　來，才知道熱度己高至四〇度了，蒙各位的福，我現在已恢復了健康！</p>
<p>今天離長沙赴南嶽。</p>
<h3 id="c2">艱苦戰鬥中的東江 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 饒秋美</p>
<p>×人雖然退出了惠博，但東莞，石龍，增城一帶邊盤據着×人，這部分×人仍不時騷擾惠博邊界：樟木頭，福和墟，　和墟，龍筆墟等地，仍一次再次遭受×人的焚燒刦役，這說明了，東江仍在戰爭中，同時，當×人價置與實行對廣東新進攻的時候，東江又是在這新進攻的威脅中。</p>
<p>因為東江是在戰爭的前面，是在戰爭中，東江的民衆，已經在開始甩『鬥爭』去迎接這價環境，這便是　東江推向前進的原動力。</p>
<p>這　我們可以看到：</p>
<p>一　游擊戰爭的開展</p>
<p>當×人在沾據惠博時，惠博的民衆已部分的打擊了×人，從博羅出龍門小路企圖給出從化之首側的二百餘×軍，全部被博羅龍門的民衆所消滅，×人退出寡博時，博羅之福和墟一帶山地中，便一鼓而殲滅了×人二百餘人，（這一役我方只傷一人）福和墟的自衛團還　落了×戶型轟炸機一架，死機師六人，及後，圍繞在羅浮山脚之正果輻和，聯和各墟場，巳不斷的開晨游擊戰爭，並且產生各種各樣形式的鬥爭，有六十餘歲老婦偷槍誘×：有黑夜摸入×營偷機關槍囘家時變成了電單車的笑話；有二十餘人假裝婦女在田中工作誘殺×人數，次戰鬥，有三五成羣混入×佔領區之　館睹場中舉行種種色色的小為動，最汕得誇耀的是增城游擊隊單容沛部百餘人，深入廣九鐵路，屢次　擊×人的交通線，並曾利用地形與×軍三百餘人作過一個上午的戰　，　羅游擊隊陳潔部，曾經在陳名頭兒親自領導之下，與×人作過大小十餘次的戰羅，（陳老頭兒，七十歲左右，　　皆自，是老國民黨員，身體康健）聯和鄉賴鄉長，親自領導該鄉民衆，不但嚴重打擊了×人每次的進犯，還幾次夜襲×營，使×人受到很大的損失，結果，在×人一深惡痛絕」之下，受到了該鄉漢奸的吿密，在一個深夜，全家十數口被慘殺，妻女被×××××，而賴鄉長本人，被綁至×人區域內，釘在十字架上，一塊肉一塊肉的割了三天才死，×人固然用盡一切殘酷無人道的手段來對付我們的游擊隊中的領袖人物及一切戰鬥員，但這只有加深了我們民衆對×人的憎恨與仇視，使東江前線，×人後方的游擊戰爭更廣泛的開展起來！</p>
<p>二　動員中的東江青年</p>
<p>東江各縣的靑年雖在種種困難的環境下，却己經動員起來了，首先講到兩個年靑的富有戰鬥性的隊伍</p>
<p>一，　東靑年抗日先算隊東江區隊，簡稱『抗先』他們一隊約七十人，從廣州退出後，就接受第四戰區民衆動員委員會的指導出發東江工作，當時×人仍在惠博，這一個隊伍便已集中河源，並向惠博邊境之埔前，石壩，古竹，觀昔閣一帶工作，積極訓練自衛團，帮助當地辦自衛團　部訓練班，在工作地區，組織「抗先」地方隊部，計在惠，柴，河，龍川，新豐，各縣，組織「抗先」在一千人以上，這些「抗先」隊員，差不多都能對當地救亡工作起相當大的推動與模範的作用。</p>
<p>二，東江華僑囘鄉服務團，她是直屬於南洋惠州十屬華僑敦鄉總會的，成立一個總團部，在各縣建立一個分團，目的在協功當地政府做抗戰動員的工作，及一切可能做到的戰時服務的工作，現在己成立而且己在積極工作的有惠州的第一團，團員約一百餘人，是最强有力的一圈，　　的第二團，有四十餘人，傅羅的第三團，有四十餘人，在近戰區一帶工作；柴會之第四團，有二十餘人，河源的第五團與龍川的第六團，　十餘人，其他和平連平降　等縣，仍未建立服務團的工作。此外，還有一救護隊二十餘人以及一個流動劇團二十餘人，價三四百個靑年幹部，如果都能有計劃的積極的在各方而去開展工作，他們對于東江將有寳貴的献。</p>
<p>其次，再說到各縣的奇年組織狀况；海豐，陸豐，五華，河源，均有縣靑年抗×同志會，組織人數以海豐為最多有二千餘人，五華也有千餘人，龍川有全縣靑年抗日先鋒錄的統一組織，和平的靑年，最大部份是在農抗會的組織中，據說，和平農抗會會員約有五千餘人，那末，最出限度有四千人應當屬於靑年，這是毫無疑問的，惠陽，博羅的發展是不平衡的，也還沒有全縣的統一組織，但組織起來的靑年總有一二千人，博羅縣政府的戰時工作隊二十餘人，河源縣抗×後援會的戰時工作隊西十餘人，都是優秀的，能獨立工作的，能刻苦耐勞與能深入羣衆的戰鬥隊伍。</p>
<p>三　前綫，心臟與後方</p>
<p>價據目前東江的地理條件與×我力量的配　上來說，東江的前綫是惠博，心臟是河源，龍川，連平，和平是後方，（當然不是大後方）而其中幾個中心點，政治環境是開明與進步的。</p>
<p>前綫的最中心地區當然是在博羅，博羅的黃　長仲榆是一個賢明的縣長，不貪汚是他的最大的優點，也能相當積極的注意開展民衆組織的工作，如縣政府的組織，戰時工作隊，舉薦陳潔做游擊　指揮，開辦自衛團幹部敎導塚，改博羅縣中為戰　中學，自兼校長，如果政府的工作能更信任靑年，大批的起用靑年，更切實的做下去，游擊戰爭必更廣泛開展，博羅的光明前途是無提的。</p>
<p>成為東江心臟的河源，是一天一天走上光明的道路，新縣長吳式鈞到任不久，工作表現當然還談不到，但為人據設是很　直，亦少官僚架子，至於縣黨部方面，却很能積極工作，在東江各縣的縣黨部，牠可以起模範作用，領導下有經常的工作除入鄉工作，在他領導下成立了全縣統一的靑年抗×同志會，縣婦女會，縣少抗×同志會，同時，在他領導下，建立了經常的各救亡團體的座談會，這座談會的組織單位，有青抗，靑年　，婦女會，少抗，抗先服務團等組織，發出共同工作綱領，由　座談會决定了許多經常工作，出版刊物，每晚必須舉行街頭歌詠，話　與演講，各團體輪流担任，靑年幹部的訓練班也在進行中。</p>
<p>後方各縣中，龍川是最中心的一縣，在交通上，經濟上，牠成為中心，在朝善戰爭的方向來說，牠比較上是接近前線的，在龍川，政治上，民運上都表現出異常的進步。全縣靑年統一組織大會在舊歷新年後召開了，　立了統一組織的『龍川靑年抗日先鋒隊』，由鄧縣長鴻芹自兼隊長，在縣長領導卜開辦過五十個年幹部的自我敎育班，最近又已開過全縣小學敎師大會，成立了全縣小學敎帥聯合會，龍川的救亡運動，不但得到了上層縣政府，縣黨部及一般紳士們的領導奧支持，還得到各地的團鄉會同學會熱烈的擁護與幫助。</p>
<p>博羅，河源，龍川這三偭中心縣政治上的繼續進步與民衆運動之猛烈開展，必然能够影響與推動整個東江形勢，從基本上轉變過來，生長新的力量，戰勝黑暗的魍鬼，東江的民衆，必須而且止在朝着個這方向邁進！</p>
<h3 id="c3">怎樣動員農村婦女？　戰時鄕村服務隊工作經驗 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>記者和陳逸雲先生作了一次長談。陳先生受蔣夫人委任新運總會婦女指導委員會戰時鄉村服務大隊長，率領女同志百餘人，輾轉湖南各鄉工作，獲得許多寳貴的作工經騐。這兒不妨拿來介紹給諸位鄕村工作同　們。</p>
<p>（一）農村工作需下最大决心中國的農村，是患着種種疾病的，旣有頑固的封建意識，又貧苦不堪，要他健康起來，參加抗戰，是需要經過相當時間的治療，然後他能供獻最大的力量。蔣委員長指示我們中國無窮盡的力量確是蘊藏在廣大的農村裏。</p>
<p>要鄉村民衆了解抗戰，必須提高他們知識水準，必需出擊報，創辦婦女識字班，兒童識字班，要婦女們充分發揮生產力量，必須設托兒所，解除他們的拖累·要鄉民注意衛生，必需領導舉行大掃除，宣傳注意家庭衛生，為維持地方治安，增强民衆抗戰情緒，必需協助除奸工作，用勸導及密報方式克服地方上的舞弊現象，鼓勵當乓和民衆協助傷兵。這些工作陳先生領導的百餘隊員都在努力進行着，馮着她們耐勞，勇敢，和堅强的决心。</p>
<p>（二）開始工作的時候</p>
<p>隊員百餘人，分作七中隊，每中隊有三小隊·每小隊有隊員四五人，各小隊就獨立散佈在各鄉鎮工作，鄉間封建意識深國，非用種種方法不能在那兒開展工作，首先在該地演戲和出　報，引起地方上的注意，然後作家庭訪問，隨身會有樂包，從服務中獲得鄉民好感，並且作自我介紹來釋除鄉民對隊員的疑盧。</p>
<p>先要獲得地方政府，地方元老紳士和知識羣衆的了解和帮助，然後處處惜他們力量的帮助來開展工作。</p>
<p>（三）怎樣鼓勵當兵</p>
<p>每當一個壯丁被征的時候，隊員就帶一點錢，帶一些爆竹·肉類，走到被征者的家裏，錢是給出征軍人家屬的·爆竹就在他家門口燃放，好奇的梅民都　　來，這時隊員乘機就向他們演說，講述自動去當兵是人人的賣任，是怎樣光榮。這樣往往會收很大效果。</p>
<p>（四）軍民合作的故事</p>
<p>××一帶，傷兵很多，但往往和民衆發生衝突，倘用適當方法，協助傷兵和民衆合作，能收很大效果。</p>
<p>有一次，一個隊員吿訴一個鄉婦，燒些開水給過路的傷兵喝，而鄉婦堅持不肯，於是隊昌拿出錢向她買，並且解說傷兵是怎樣為民衆而受傷的，民衆應該怎樣　助他，於是這鄉婦被感動了，地不但願意不要錢的供給開水，並且還燒蕃聽慰勞傷兵。</p>
<p>（五）怎樣辦托兒所</p>
<p>隊員所到的地方，凡當地婦女有很多參加勞作的，就在該地設立托兒所。收容從一歲到六七歲的兒童。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c4">如果封鎖中國海？ <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>這幾天，日方大聲申言要封鎖中國海。照理，這是一種斷然的手段，一開戰，便該實行。當日本　　對華戰爭初，中外人士等著他這一資。可是到開戰近兩年，而且連只在大聲　。如果當作威脅英美　助成他奪取租界；甚至於策應歐陸上的德意，離間蘇英法間的接近等作用看，實在也看不出有威脅的力量，只是一種被擊而狂　的行動罷了。</p>
<p>實屬　麼意思？我們毋須顧問，不過現在有人提出：如果把中國海封鎖了，對於中國的經濟將發生什麼變化？一般人最擔心的：在封鎖之後　中國便不肥　外購買軍火；中國人民的生活用品也就無法進口；中國的土產也就無法出口。</p>
<p>關於這幾個問題，確然値得考慮。但答復是「顯然無妨一。</p>
<p>第一：自從西南各口淪陷後，中國政府的軍需品，都取道某某幾條國際路綫，都不須通過中國海。所以日本如要載斷海外軍火濟準，應該請日本海軍突破新加坡軍港；應該請日本降軍打府新疆。否則是沒有用的。</p>
<p>第二個問題，在地域上應該分淪陷區和後方兩　來答復，在生活方式上又該分節約和祟奢兩陣人來說。後方民需品，果然不少都從中國海上運去的。但中國海沒有截斷的今日，重慶每令報紙還是要　到八十元多，上海現在的市價不七元五角左右。重慶的紙價這聲貴，但當地的出版事業並未停止過，因為他們已都採用士紙了。他如內地　缺約紗布之類，情形由一樣。由此可見未封鎖的現在，事實上已和封鎖了的一　，目前內地的人民活非特維持有方，而且反因手工業發達，增進了他們的所得。洋貨市埸的上海，封鎖之後，當然要發生大問題，但最到霉的還只是歐　商人，日商是不甘放棄這磯會的，可是當華人也跟現在的內地一樣節約和採用土產品時，那末日商又要自食其果了。</p>
<p>上面的這些答復，也適用於第三個問題，事實上旣不能打擊中國政府取得出口外匯，結果反打碎日本自己現有取得出口外匯的辦法了。</p>
<p>日本經濟力完全依存世界商品市場，他取中國原料，加工後以之輸出。然當日本封鎖中國洧防的時候。他的海外重現也必同時完全被人封銷了。雖則他可　佔中國市場，甚至日貨在中國　或有顧客，但那時中國的一股購買力，必跟出口或少而激減。何況他現在的出口，專為換取軍火。中國旣無軍火可供給，歐美呢，現在已在禁止軍火　日，到那時必更　底進行。有人說：日本對華戰爭　將兩年，所以不敢正式宣戰，不敢眞正封鎖中國海口，主要理由之　　就在這兒，不錯，這就是最大理由之、而且現在依然存在。所以誰都認為日方這次的狂吼，不外是外交上的恫嚇作用而巳。</p>
<h3 id="c5">從日圓跌價推論「華興劵」 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 張宗濤</p>
<p>中日戰爭，已近兩載，日本己不得不被迫作長期之戰爭。長期戰爭最主要之戰略，不外乎消耗×國之經濟力量經濟力之消耗程度如何，雖表現於一般經濟現象中，而其集合之表現；恐在兩國貨幣價値之變化。故日本無日不謀攫取中國外匯基金；以為藉此可以直接影響法幣信用，間接影響人民抗戰心理；同時使中國對外購買軍需品之力量减低。在華北發行「聯銀券」者蓋此。但法幣堅　如恒，日人之陰謀不但未能如願，且已自食其果，日圓之一再跌價，足以表示日本經濟力之　趨崩潰，同時反證中國抗戰前途之樂觀。</p>
<p>日圓之　價，非自今日始：遠在去年之六七月間；然當日之跌勢不若今日之烈。五月初，暗市上之日圓，尙居法幣之上，但五月十六日以「華興商業銀行』擴脹開幕，開始　跌，至於今日，可以法幣八十八元買進日圓百元。此何以故？可分遠因近因論之：</p>
<p>遠因：（一）通貨擴脹——蓋自中日戰爭開始以來，日本經濟漸見困頓，端賴發行赤字公債，印行紙幣，籍以維持對華戰爭。早年日本財政家以為，日本公債發行額如達百價圓，卽為危險。但今日之非常支出，已使公債額超過百九十憶元強；此猶不論，最　困難者，當為其所發行之公債，大部未經民問吸收；而存於日本銀行，郵局及大財閥之保　庫中。公債無法消化，而軍需殷亟；則政府惟有諸紙幣之發行；以淸償賬目。紙　發行，超出限額，當使通貸擴賬；亦卽種下日圓下跌之因也。</p>
<p>（二）金準備不足——密勒氏評論週報云，據可為之報吿，自中日戰起後，日本銀行之庫存黃金，已有三五二百萬元運往美國；用以償什棉，鐵，油及其他戰爭設備。因此今日之日圓紙幣，已與無準務無異。除　每年生產黃金二五白萬元外，別無來源。但紙幣發行，反在激增；是不能維持其信用矣。</p>
<p>（三）軍用　之流行——日本在華作戰，軍餉之發給多用「軍用券」，其目的不外一方而救外匯之缺乏，一方擾亂法幣；然比種不現之「軍用券」：流于民間，猶如廢紙；持有此券者無不想早日　手；調換法幣。「軍用券」與日圓不無聯繫；日圓乃大受「軍用券」之跌價而跌價。</p>
<p>（四）日本與法西斯國之聯合——日圓本為正式運繫於英鎊者，始得民主國家之信仰，而自戰爭爆發後，日與德意串通一氣，因而使民主國家對日圓殊為猜疑。</p>
<p>近因（一）「聯銀券」之跌價——最近華北「聯銀券」節節跌價，相與聯繫之日圓自亦隨之跌價。更有投機者，利用機會，以華北之日圓套換上海之法幣，因之滬地日圓頭寸堆多；益使日圓下跌。</p>
<p>（二）法幣信用之堅穩——法幣之基礎，原極堅穩，自英借款成立，外匯基金增加後；法幣之對外信用　益見增强；因之淪陷區內中外人民被迫接受之日圓，紛紛換取價値穩定之法幣；日圓於是慘跌不止。</p>
<p>（三）限制對華貨物輸出——日本鑒於華中日圓之跌價；恐影響其國內計，故忽有限制對華中貿易之舉；因而使留於滬地之大量日圓，一時無法吸收；同時內地所有之『軍用劵』，因無法購日貨，故均運至上海換成法幣。因此滬地日圓供過於求，勢必跌價。</p>
<p>（四）日本統制偽『滿』及華北華中之之出口——偽『滿』華北每年輸滬之大豆，豆油，小麥，棉花等貨，華中則以米，絲等貨運滬，為數皆極巨大；今日方壟斷此種士產，限制其運滬，滬地日圓籌碼，以致過剩，價値自然下跌。</p>
<p>（五）移民激增——我軍西移後，日人移民於華中之數激增，故携來之日圓為數定甚可觀。汜濫於上海金股市場上，當然大大影響日圓之價値。</p>
<p>在此日圓　價聲中正當華興商業銀行成立之時；可知其間亦小無相互之因，在。</p>
<p>蓋「華興銀行」之成立，乃由日人化而出；計釗發行「華興券」，吸收法幣一套取外匯。華興與「聯銀券」出之一貫作風·但「聯準銀行」為參加「日圓集團」者，故其發行之「聯銀券」與日圓等値；「華興銀行」聞以法幣準備，割斷與日圓關係，因此而反映日圓能力之　弱。黑市場因之而拋售日圓，爭購法幣矣。</p>
<p>至於「華興券」，價値必更不如日圓。因日圓猶不願担保復有為之保障其信用？彰彰明甚。旦以華北『聯銀券』失敗為澄，「華興劵」之前途，更為黯淡，因華北之環境優于華中多多：（一）華北對外貿易入超不如華中之大。（二）華北之市埸不如華中之複錄。（三）日本在華北之政治經濟勢力，較華中根深蒂固·雖然：「聯銀券」尙不免節節跌價，處境更難之「華興券」當然更無辦法，不言可喻（轉載上海申報）</p>

<p>— 本報山西戰地特約記者　金在镕</p>
<p>在晉南前線，是常常聽到『紅學會』（卽紅槍會）的消息的，這樣的團體，在我們眼中眞是神秘極了。我總想去探訪他們一次，若究竟是怎樣的一囘事。恰巧，平陸北部約二個「紅學」聯絡員來了，他們旣沒有義和團的派頭而又帶有農民應有的恭謹態度，我商得他們的同意，决定和他們一同囘去。</p>
<p>一個徵風細雨的早晨，我和兩個一紅學」的聯絡員出發了。由我們所住的地方到「紅學」的鄉村，一共六十多里。晉南冲積層是最多山溝的，下過雨後的坭路，是滑到了不得，我們經過一個五百尺高的山溝時，不是走下去而是滾下去的。在中條山脚，那里巳相當接近前綫，是川軍的防地。在這里山　的道路，一部份是被破壞了，那更討厭，我們倒變或爬虫了。一直走到下午五時，才到「紅學」的鄉村——××溝。</p>
<p>××溝是一個不深的山濤，開了很多的窰洞，在溝的東西頭，都有雄糾糾的壯健農夫站崗，他們都拿若紅纓矛子，沉着的注視前方，因為離這里兩里路，便是×人的陣地了，在不遠的土山之上，更有×人的炮兵陣地，所以這村子天天挨大炮！</p>
<p>「紅學」的會所是在一所天地廟內，我進了廟內以後，許多壯健的農夫和小孩早聚攏來了，他們先不問「客從何處來』，却把我們帶來的兩杆步槍拿走了（槍是帶來送給他們的），在外面把槍機扳得格格的響，由此可知他們愛槍的程度了。招待我們的是當地的閭長，因為不知我們的來意，所以露出相當的困態，後來經我們把來意說明，他才放下一會重担。接着，我見到那「紅學』的會長，據說晉南中條山脉兩側，由陽城縣到運城止，共有「紅學」八萬餘人，分乾門，一心堂（又名黑道門，坎門），白善堂，乾順會等四個道門，每一個道門都有一個總會；總會之下有分會。現在分佈於平陸北部的是乾順會，總會在中條山以北夏縣屬的××村，共有會員七百多人。</p>
<p>至於平陸北部的『紅學」會，是農民的自發組織，他們大都是住在×人的前方或側後方的村子，不願逃離自己的本鄉同時也不願做順民，在×人蹂躪之後，乃連合起來保護家鄉。這些組織成立以後，曾和×人作戰過，因此×人現在不敢小看這里的民衆了，非得大隊人馬，不敢再下鄉來。現在他們分佈在安家溝，蘇韓村，勺堡，風口，古城，窰頭等六個地方，會員約二百多人，對×人成大包圍的形勢。</p>
<p>有些人傳說『紅學』會受×人利用，消息的來源是這樣的：『中條山以北，夏縣，安邑縣境，雖然失陷了。×人是無法完全統治的，民衆就在這種情形之下。成立保護家鄉的紅槍會，但因為羽毛未豐，也不敢和×人作戰，只求×人不來便算了事。而×人也進行民衆運動的工作，常和他們來往，幷且時時召集他們開會，借牲口給他們耕作，公買公賣。他們帶了『紅學』的臂章和符帶（該會神物之一，是三英寸寬的藍布條，事面藏着神符，斜掛在身上，可以保護身體），可以進城（×人統治的，而受不到麻煩。為着爭取他們存在，因此祇好和×人敷衍，這就是『紅學』受×人利用的消息之由來』。至于在山南的『紅學』，則和山北的完全不相同了，他跟×人對峙，幷且常去破壞×人的電信交通。</p>

<p>名稱——『華興商業銀行』（英文名HuaHaingCommerceialBank）。</p>
<p>行址——『總行』上海賽樂安路二號，南京分行設領康路朱省路角，以上總分行聞已謚五月十五日『開』，復業計劃在蘇州，杭州等地增設「分行」。</p>
<p>資本——五千萬元（觀其對於「華與券」欲與法幣平價之企圖，比五千萬元之資本價値，似與五千萬元之法幣相等）。</p>
<p>投資者——偽『維新政府』二千五百萬元</p>
<p>日本方面二千五百萬元</p>
<p>（內）與業銀行五百萬元</p>
<p>朝鮮銀行豪灣銀行三幷銀行三菱銀行住友銀行各四百萬元</p>
<p>人物——『總裁』陳錦濤（偽「維新政府財政部長」）</p>
<p>「副總裁」尾磯一（偽「滿洲中央銀行理事」）</p>
<p>『理事』岡崎嘉平太（前日本銀行調查主任）海老原竹之助（前正金銀行檢查人）沈汝昌（前大陸銀行董事）戴遜廬（前中國銀行大阪分行經理，一說戴兼任偽行經理云。）</p>
<p>『監察』陳日平（偽『偽維新政府財政部次長』）</p>
<p>業務——（一）貼現（二）押匯（三）買賣外匯（四）買賣金銀與外幣（五）存款（六）斡旋票據（七）保管（八）儲蓄</p>
<p>特樣——發行『華興銀行劵』，開業時由『維新政府』存入無利存欵一千萬元，並理『維新政府國庫事務』。</p>
<p>期限——『營業期限三十年』。</p>
<p>從該行組織上，卽可知其决無前途。牠顯然是南京一維新政府一頭兒們，和日本的財閥資本與軍閱靑本的合夥打劫機關，掛「商業銀行」幌子，以與帶「國家銀行」的「聯合準備銀行」有別，與其說為了想樹立「自然信用」（卽非武力造成的信用），毋寧說是與北派頭兒　分贓所得的結果。南北兩偽組織間之爭權奪利的劇烈，由此可見。</p>
<p>設立「華奧銀行」和發行偽鈔的動機，日商日軍與偽組織各異。日商的動機在原料荒和外匯荒，他們希望從中國戰區內充份得到原料和外匯資源，但希望有個控制中國貿易的金融機關，並有一種能以貫澈上項目的而可自由使用的通貨。</p>
<p>日軍的動機在軍需荒和戰略荒。因為沒有外匯，便不能買外國軍火：沒有充分的經費去向龐大的部隊發給軍餉等等，便是他們感覺最苦的軍需荒。游擊隊的活躍，使日軍最感頭痛，在前綫始終吃緊，後方又擾擾不休，戰略上他着實感到沒有辦法，所以很想從貨幣金融上，摧毀我軍財力基礎。</p>
<p>至於禽獸　組織方面的動機，一言以蔽之，便在計劃充分的發財，這批東西之出任『新貴』，無非想撈幾個錢。若不能造錢，卽難達飽慾之望；旣不能馭下，更不能大量牧買朋黨和爪牙。</p>
<p>所以他們對於發行『華與劵』，對於破壞法幣，原則上是一致的，但辦法上就各有其是·據說以法幣作『華券』準備，是日本財閥和偽組織的主張勝利。他們果然希望法幣崩潰，但明知無望，因此想，叨法幣的光，使杜造的「華券」値錢，於是日商可以搜括戰區內的原料，減少他對華的外匯需要。偽組織可以發薪，易於使朋黨和爪牙們馴服。但日本軍部的意見就絕對茅盾，旣希望叨法略的光，使『華券』具外匯價値發餉容易，但又望在『華券』和法幣聯繫下，以『華券』的信破產，而使法幣的信用也跟着一同破產自從我平準委會宣佈暫停申請外匯並抑低法幣暗市價格後，無疑這企圖已失敗了。</p>
<p>該行主要任務，類在發行偽鈔，但具有日本國家銀行性質的日本銀行，及匯兌銀行性質的正金銀行並不參加，可知其早有不維持偽鈔的决，同時亦係日本的官僚金融資本與日本的軍部金融資本（如朝鮮及臺　二行）對此不合作的反映。</p>
<p>「聯銀」和『聯鈔』的失敗，使他們己覺悟到槍刺不能辦理金融工作，武力不能樹立貨幣信用，但是要樹立自然信用，談何容易？何况所謂五千萬元資本，雖說是「實收」，實際誰會相信？試看前述的所謂『特權』裏，列有「維新政府」在該行開市時，存入無利存款一千萬元，並經理「國庫業務」云云，可知他內幕的空虛。我敢相信：這種資本。大部份都用日本軍用票抵充，因為事實上他們决無這筆有餘的資金。</p>
<p>再看「華興銀行」的主要業務在「統制貿易匯兌」不辦普通商業金融放款。但是統制進口，必使「國際糾紛」益形惡化。統制出口，技衛困難將决定他整個陰謀的失敗。因為他唯一可能的辦法是：半路攔截，和强制收買，且非以槍刺為其後盾不可。這就根本不能替「華券」樹立自然信用，結果必重蹈「聯鈔」的失敗覆轍。而且要使攔截成功，非有周密的緝「私」網不可。但在中國的農村社會和老販經濟裏，這羅網必是千漏百洞了。何况又是秩序混亂的戰時，游擊隊到處活躍的時代，最多只能攔到少數的出口貨罷了。而且這可以攔到的出口外匯，大部份必定被目前担任這種攔貨詐財的小嘍啰及日本浪人們所中飽，或得賄放走，或全部吞沒。這樣的結果，日本財閥和官僚早己洞悉，所以這堂堂的日本六大銀行，僅肯合出資本二千五百萬元，那就是開眼吃老鼠藥的表示。</p>
<p>要使「强制收買」有效，以「華券」確有價値為條件。但「華券一的推銷，勢所必然的僅靠槍刺為後盾的一强制收買」。郎末「華券」就根本沒有信用，根本不能自然發生他的價値，組還是廢組而已。</p>
<p>要使法幣跟『華券』的失敗而崩潰，這是一個要想，，姑不談法幣本身有準備，有國際信用，有政治的經濟的所交織成的自然信用，僅就以法幣為「華券一的準備一點而言，結果反善法幣的信用做宣傳，反使人民愛護法幣，而因此乃至拒用「華券」。因為法幣有實力，有信用，才會被人硬拉作保，這個道理，三歲小孩子也懂得。何况法幣根本沒有作保，除了日偽之外，也沒有人會相信法幣是「華券」的保人，這個「拖人落水」的陰謀，自然是絲毫沒有實現希望的。</p>

<h3 id="c20">爭取金融戰的最後勝利 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>奧國名將莫德古古里氏曾經說過，『作戰的第一要素是金錢，第二要素是金錢，第三要素亦是金錢。』而第一次歐洲大戰，英法等國如果沒有美國的借欵和供給軍需品，則未及美國宣佈參戰而已有失敗的句虞。時至今日，則任何戰爭，都與金融有不可分割的關係。所以我們今日一面要從戰場上爭取長後勝利，同時還要在金融戰爭中爭取勝利，來保障與提前全面抗戰的勝利。</p>
<p>抗戰廿三個月以來，我國在賢明當局的領導之下，在全國金融界及民族資本的忠誠愛國擁護中央國策之下，在國際友邦的同情贊助之下，卽在金融戰鬥中，也始終佔有優勝的地位。相反的，日本金融界則已遭遇嚴重的困難與危機，惡性通貨膨脹的事實，不僅正在摧毀其國民經濟結構，並且還在加重侵華軍事的困難；而最近華北偽幣政策的慘敗，更證明了日×一切解救其困難的辦法亦屬無路可通。截止昨日電訊，我國法幣雖巳計劃地跌至折合港幣僅値五成，但較諸連日狂跌莫可換救的日幣價格則尙高出陸分！</p>
<p>日×目前的金融戰略，主要的也是憑籍政治的攻勢，扶植汪精衛等××的政權，強化佔領區的統治，企圖利用我國民力物力，一面解救其本身的困難，一面來加增我國的困難。而為華興銀行之活動，利用日幣為幣狂跌來換取法幣，更藉法幣以套取外滙，就是他們這種戰略之第一步的實施，這種金融上的進攻，更有繼續瘋狂發展的可能。</p>
<p>我們為了適時的加以重大打擊，就有這次暫時抑低法幣價格。即運用平衝委會的權力，加以必要的控制。這樣一來，第一可以打破日×漢奸以日幣為幣吸收外匯威脅法幣的計劃；第二可以制止無限制的資助對上海的入超的現象，亦可說是加強外匯統制的効力；（按上海最近兩日內大量入超，每日吸收去外匯二百萬鎊。）第三，從全面觀察，則更可調整匯價與匯兌情形，旣可防制投機商人，又可平衡全國出入口貿易。因此可知法幣跌價後種種謠言顯屬毫無根據，與不可動搖的法幣信用無關。</p>
<p>不過我們為要爭取金融戰的更大的勝利，覺得還有幾點要努力：第一，中央從上年三月十二日實施限制購買外匯以後，中外孚信大增，法幣信用穩固，軍事經濟各端都獲助益。但是一面有』般昧於天良之徒的千方百計進行其資金逃亡，尙待加以法律的制止，一面關於限制外匯，依據抗戰建國需要，何者允許何者拒絕，亦須有更具體明確的規定。卽是說對於外匯，應作更進一步的統制，並且根據抗戰建國需要，同時加強對外貿易的統制。第二，今後×人頗有傾力刧掠佔領區與排除歐美列強灌益之勢，而濫發紙幣，取我物產，輸出海外，換得軍火等以作進一步的進攻，亦是必然趨勢，所以我們還要一面加緊外交工作，推進援華制日運動，一面擴大淪陷區的游擊戰鬥，號召淪陷區同胞拒用偽鈔，反對及打擊汪×漢奸傀儡偽組織。第三，我們消極的要設法阻絕日偽方面施行外匯口岸與上海外匯市場的關係，同時積極的要設法使上海資金大量內移，推進內地生產經濟建設。而所有這一切，一面固有賴於政府統制力量的增强，廉潔與人才政治的普遍，一面有恃於全中華民族對政府的信賴，和對於戰時金融財政政策的忠誠擁護。</p>

<h3 id="c26">英政府頒佈律例　指示英屬各地防空　詳細規定避彈室建築法　本港亦將依照此項方法進行 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>世界戰雲密佈、侵略國家時欲胃險一試、兩年來歐洲局勢、無日不在動盪不寧中、英國政府爲維持世界和平、防止野心國家暴動、實行整軍經武、充實國防實力、以備應付萬一、英國國內各地及各屬殖民地之安全防衛、莫不積極準備、防空工作尤爲其中之最重要者、觀乎本港近數年來防空工作之緊張、可見一班、蓋在未來大戰中、空中戰爭、將必成爲最慘酷之一種、英國政府對此不能不作禾雨綢繆也、</p>
<p>頒佈律例　指示防空</p>
<p>英政府對于國內各地及各地殖民地之防空工作計劃、前經迭有公佈、最近又頒般白皮書一種、該書內詳細揭載對于工廠商店及屋宇之防空律例、指示在戰時各工廠商店及屋宇之防空方法、以保護其職員或工人之安全、並現定凡僱有五十名以上職員或工人之商店工廠、其所在地又爲貼近危險地帶者、則一律須遵照此項辦法辦理、書中所載對于室內室外之避彈室避彈壕或隧道之建築方法、採用之原料及面積位置等、俱有指定、該項律例將在英國國內各地及英屬各殖民地租借地施行、本港方面亦將依照該白皮書所指示之方法、進行防空工作、</p>
<p>保護安全　兩種方法</p>
<p>據探悉該律例中最重要之一節、卽爲工廠屋宇商店避彈地方之設備、其中雖未有規定避彈室內必須有防避毒氣之設置、但規定必須具有上述之準備、以便在急　時可以隨時應付、此點對於英國政府最初之防毒計劃巳略有改變、該律例指出避彈室之建設、其地點應極力使其與避彈者所處之地位接近、使無論在白晝或夜間、避難者在得聆警報聲五分鐘內卽可抵達、關于保護商店職員安全之方法約有兩點、第一、在屋宇外之地面或地底設置避彈室避彈壕或避彈隧道、第二、建設室內避彈室、</p>
<p>避彈壕室　建築規定</p>
<p>此種戶內避彈室、種類約可分爲四種、甲、在工廠內之地下建築避彈壕或隧道、乙、利用工廠內之地窖作爲避彈室、丙、選擇適當之房屋或走廊、盡量加亞其鞏固力、以作爲避彈室、丁、在工廠屋宇內專闢一避彈室、各避彈室其一部份、或全部份在地下者、每一人所佔有之面積不得少過六方尺、高度不得少過二十五方尺、爲减低遭受直接轟炸之損失起見、每一避彈室限容留五十人、倘該室面積較廣、可以容留多過五十人以上者、則每五十人須隔以堅固之墻壁、但總額不能超過二百人、各避彈室之距離亦不得少過二十五英尺、倘有可能、則須距離至三十尺、</p>
<p>注意衛護　工廠人員</p>
<p>又爲避免出路被封閉之危險起見、每室應設有出路　兩處、該兩處出路之距離越遠越佳、至於戶內避彈室、應設在該屋宇之樓下、或地牢、如因特別情形、或無地牢之屋宇、則可以二樓爲避彈室、工廠內之人員、其負實看管機器或其他重要工作、而又具有相當防空常識者、應供其得到妥善之避彈地方、戶外避彈室之地點、則須極力找尋最適宜之地方、避彈隧道則應建　在屋宇之附近、使一且有事、避彈者可從容入內、不致因秩序混亂而發生不幸事件、面積方而、規定每一英畝容留一千二百人、具有重要性之工廠、其避彈地方應設在工廠之附近、以免因避難虛耗時間而妨礙其工作、此外尤應注意老則爲工廠內各種化學原料危險品之存放、應注意將之遷移、以避免發生意外云云、上述乃該律例中之較爲重要者、其他對于避彈室建築之原料等、亦有指定云、</p>

<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>昨天，才過了上午七時吧，一向靜寂的快活谷已經給幾千羣衆包園得水洩不通。人聲如沸，打破了靜寂，變作熱鬧非常，到跑馬地來的電車，巴士還擠擁不堪地把爲看英王壽辰閱操的人，一批批的載來。</p>
<p>跑馬廳裏，也給幾百外國紳士和太太站滿，他們大部份在看台後的酒排間裏吃着一早茶一，安閒地：等候閱兵禮的開始。廳外的羣衆，沒有這般亨受了，好得小販們投機，把許多糕餅搬出來賣給觀衆充饑。</p>
<p>七貼半，參加閱操的海陸空軍隊伍陸續到齊，人數一共有二千五百多人，給中西官紳和領事團專設的來賓席A，也坐滿了；其餘，官佐家屬，童軍，學生，記者等席也都坐滿了人。</p>
<p>七時四十五分，指揮官駐華陸軍總司令　乃錫少將，偕同參　長及　官抵步，全體受檢官兵都肅立致敬。</p>
<p>賈少將戎裝打扮，乘駿馬，往來馳騁，先把隊伍檢閱一番。</p>
<p>上午八時正，港督羅富國爵士，偕同副官巴地史美上尉，乘了汽車，由義勇軍電單車隊護衛到場，指揮官喝令隊伍立正，行軍禮致敬，時英國國旗亦緩緩上升，飄揚在司令台前之旗杆頂。</p>
<p>港督穿白色金肩章的總司令禮服，胸懸章，冠飄白翎，佩劍。副官亦穿自禮服，冠飄紅翎，很堂皇的樣子，他給隊伍囘禮後，卽出場檢閱，這時雖然下着大雨，檢閱禮就在雨中舉行。</p>
<p>檢　畢，港督步上司令台，新任香港海軍司令畢達士，空軍司令白朗，海軍義勇軍司令比提利斯，陸軍義勇軍總指揮羅斯等高級長官早在台恭候。</p>
<p>港督在司令台站定後，指揮官一聲號令，隊伍都作分列式，準備操過司令台。香港警衛軍軍樂隊卽行到台前，開始奏着進行曲。</p>
<p>在軍樂柔揚聲中，指揮官賈少將二馬當先，領導着：海軍，海軍義勇軍，第八重炮團，第五高射炮團，港星炮兵香港團，工兵團，蘇格蘭皇軍第二營，米杜息陸軍第一營，蘭普丹尼印兵第五營，高望印兵第一營，騾車隊，空軍，及香港義勇軍隊等部隊，繞場操過。</p>
<p>當隊伍經司令台前時，官佐舉劍，與士兵同向台上長官行注目體，台上港督以次諸長官都舉手還禮。</p>
<p>操畢，又列隊如前。港督及各長官均下司令台，到旗杆前站立。號兵業號後，旗杆上的英國國旗徐徐降下，改升英王王旗，樂隊高奏英國國歌，全體肅立，表示英王駕臨。</p>
<p>王旗作深紅，黃。藍三色；上左方和下右方都是深紅色，每方綉有金　三，上右方是黃色，綉有紅獅和紅邊沿；下左方長藍色，綉金獅。</p>
<p>國歌奏完，全體官　士兵，都脫帽，歡呼三聲，旋又嗚號，將王旗降下，改升英國旗，表示英王離去，全體又行舉手禮歡送，每次行禮都由港督代表英王接受。</p>
<p>典禮告成，港督先行離場；仍由義勇軍電單車隊護送離去。會操的海陸空軍各部隊和觀眾也相繼散去，時候已是九時半了。</p>

<h3 id="c39">服務文化，輔助青年，本報發起　學生壹元讀報運動　各校深表同情，紛紛予以合作 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>要是一個有爲的靑年學生，報紙——進步的報紙——就是他的精神食粮。精神食粮有所間斷，很空虛地就覺得若有所失。精神食粮要是不够充實，立刻就有不滿足之感。這是很多朋友——特別是求知慾亢進的靑年學生——共同的體驗。說明報紙的價值，這是第一點。</p>
<p>學　的課本，是學生求知的源泉。一個忠於學問的學生，不能不忠於課本，但是，世界的知識，千頭萬緒。文化的進步，亦日新月異；要是以爲課本就是學問的全貌，那無異是井蛙之見。那麽，什麽是最好的補充材料？，什麽是最現實最生動的課本呢？無疑的，報紙就是最重要的一種，一個忠於學問的學生，是不能不忠於報紙的。說明報紙的價值，這是第二點。</p>
<p>個人的生存，决定於整個社會。一個健全的國民，不可不明瞭國家的動態。中國是世界的一環，明瞭國際現狀，是作爲現代人的起碼條件。因此，了解時事，研究時事，是靑年學生生活課題之一。在香港要提高靑年學生的民族意識，報紙更是重要的工具。尤其是在偉大神聖的抗戰建國運動的時候。說明報紙的價值，這是第三點。</p>
<p>以上所述，還只是犖大者而已，其實報紙的利益何止於此。</p>
<p>一個賢明的敎師，指準學生開報就成爲重要敎育方法之一；指導學生剪報貼報，就成爲主要的一種課外作業。在香港能够生意及此的賢明敎師畢竟大有人在。不過，問題跟着發生了：</p>
<p>一，報紙太貴，很多學生買不起；</p>
<p>二，如何剪報？如何貼報？才算合理化？</p>
<p>這是各校在指導學生閱報中所感到的難題。本報荷蒙本港敎育界先進的愛護，慶次向我們提供很多寶貴的意見，使我們非常感奮。</p>
<p>本報以爲敎育是國家的命脉，而報紙又爲推動教官的利器。在這國家民族生死存亡關頭，敎育界和新聞界當然更有加緊携手合作的必要。因此發起了『學生一元讀報運動』。關於這個運動的內容，已見本報敎師節『告本港敎育界書』，大意就是：</p>
<p>一，盡景介紹有益於靑年學生「德智體美」等四育，而又富於感情及趣味言論文字；並鼓勵學生發表其作品或意見——故（甲）除原有之評論，特寫，國內外新聞，「自由談」體育，遊藝，電影戲劇等　外，擬增闢一「學生惘」，專爲歡迎學生投稿，並酬稿費，（乙）以每一學校爲單位，經學校當局同意，舉行學生時事論文競會，常識測驗，及時事演講會，辯論會，座談會等，務使其讀報之所得完全化爲活的智識，及現實的學問。</p>
<p>二，指導靑年學生讀報之方法，促成其讀報之習慣，故擬選擇每晨敝報發表之重要公文若干篇，鼓勵讀報之學生一一加以剪黏，根據每篇文字之性質，代爲分類，俾於剪黏後可以立卽分析歸類，所有黏報之紙張，類目卞片及分類表等，皆由敝報預先製就分發學生應用，學生每隔若干時日卽可將所剪黏之報紙，分訂成冊，成爲最親切最現實的參攷資料，一方面增加其了解時事之能力，一方面訓鍊其一般的治　及辦事之方法。以上所述之時事論文競賽，及時事測驗，時事演講辯論競賽會等，其題材卽取給於剪報而得之參考資料，凡有優異成績表現者，皆當特予獎勵。</p>
<p>三，減低報紙之售價使學生人人能讀報而其家長不覺負担之沈　——故擬將報紙售價竭力減低，至每三個月港幣一元，每日讀報兩大張，僅合港幣一仙，可謂開本港新聞界空前未有之　錄！至於黏報之紙張，及類目卡片及分類表，亦由本報代辦，紙上印有學生姓名及其所屬學校之名稱，僅收極低謙之代價而已。</p>
<p>學生訂報，應請所屬學校證明，並塡妥學生住址。本報於每晨學校開始授課前，派員將當日的報紙連同重要文字分類表送到各校，請各校按級轉派各學生，但逢星期日及例假日則由本報直接派至通學生之住址。</p>
<p>有人說：這個運動，在本報不僅是虧本錢，而且是我麻煩。可是，我們自認對于年靑學生讀者負有重大的義務，所以殺然决然地幹起來了。</p>
<p>日來，熱心與我們合作推行這個運動的，有知用中學，華僑中學，華南中學，廣大附中，磐光中學，業餘學校，海南職業學校，眞光中學，領英中學等學校。我們誠懇要求其他各校亦迅速和我們携手起來。並希望學生家長予以充分的同情。我們另有詳細辦法，歡迎敎育界和靑年學生讀者們索閱，地址是中環砵甸乍街二號，本報當業部，電話；二八七五〇號。</p>

<p>上海因地理上之優勢，早爲外商所注意。當淸乾隆時代，英商東印度公司中人卽獻議於公司當局，稱上海爲一有望之商港。嘉慶中以申禁雅片之故，本在粵東經商之英人，頗不耐煩，圖闢粵東以外商埠甚亟，道光十二年派員至滬考察，要求在扈通商，爲道台吳其泰所拒絕，未有結果而去。越三年，林則徐在粵焚雅片，英人卽與我國開戰。道光二十年六月英軍陷定海，二十二年四月佔乍浦；五月初八日佔吳淞，十一日佔上海。十五日英軍離上海，溯江而上，進攻鎭江南京，七月初四日英國攻擊南京。我國以不堪新式武　　　　，卽宣佈議和。七月二十四日欽差大臣伊里布及耆英與英國全權代表璞鼎香簽訂講和條約十三款，卽所謂南京條約。該約第二款規定五口通商云：</p>
<p>「（一）自今以後大皇帝恩准英國人民帶同所屬家眷，寄居沿海之廣州，福州，厦門，寗波，上海等五處港口貿易，通商無　，英國君宇派設領事管事等處，住該五處城邑，專理商　事官，與各該地方公文往來，令英人按照下條開叙之例，淸楚交納貨稅鈔晌等費。』</p>
<p>道光二十三年所訂通商善後條約第六款云：</p>
<p>『廣東等五港口，英商或長川居住，或不時來往均不可妄到鄉間任意遊行，更不可遠入內地貿易。中華地方官應與英國管事官，各就地方民情地勢議定界址，不許踰越，以期永久彼此相安。凡係水手及船上人等，俟管事官與地方官先行立定禁約之後方進上岸。倘有英人違背此條禁約，　到內地遠遊者；不論係何品級，卽聽該地方民人捉拿交英國管事官依情處罪，但該民人等不得擅自毆打傷害，致傷和好。』</p>
<p>又第七款云：</p>
<p>『在萬年和約內，言明允准英人携眷赴廣州，福州，廈門，寧波，上海五港口居住不相欺侮，不加拘制。但中華地方官必須與英國管事官，各就地方民情，議定於何地方，用何房屋或基地，係准英人租賃。其價備必照五港口之現在所　高低爲準，務求平允。華民不許勒索，英商不許强租。英國管事官每年以英人或建屋若干間，或租屋若干所，通知地方官轉報立案。惟房屋之增减，　乎商人之多寡，視乎貿易之衰肚，難於預定額數』。</p>
<p>上列數款均與上海有關，亦卽上海開埠之基本條約，道光二十三年九月十七日第一任英領巴爾輻（G，Balfour）挾其翻譯麥華陀（Med　hurst）從舟山至上海，越一星期，卽宣告上海正式開埠。</p>
<p>英國旣打開中國門戶，法美乃亦追　而至。道光二十四年九月，法與華訂立黃埔條約三十六欵。美國於同年五月與華訂立望　條約。兩種條約均爲五口通商之條約也。</p>
<p>上海開埠後，外人陸續來滬居留，設置居留地，卽所謂租界也。最初爲英租界，租界有章程，稱地皮章程，或稱地產章程。俗稱洋涇濱章程，英租界第一次章程在道光二十五年，由滬道宮慕久所公佈，計二十三款，後又增加一款共二十四款，規定邊界，租地手續及外僑應遵守事宜，其後外僑屢次自行改訂修正，形成今日公共租界市政法之實質，本來面目全非矣。第一次所訂地皮章程，中文本已不可得；一八五二年一月十七日英文字林西報上載有英文全文，譯文載上海市通志館期刊第一期，學者可取以研究者也。</p>
<p>同治二年以前，上海無所謂公共租界，蓋其時英美兩租界各各獨立也·美租界之成立，係在道光二十八年，發動創立美租界者，爲「文監師」，卽文監師路之文惠廉（Wm．I．Boone）牧師，後美租界中治安發生問題，美人提議以美租界合併於英租界，於是公共租界始告成立。最初英租界面積僅一百三十八畝，光緒廿五年時，公共租界面　爲五千五百八十三英畝，換算中國畝數，則爲三萬三千餘畝然越界築路四萬七千餘畝，尙不在內，上列面　數，卽今日之面積勢。</p>
<p>上海法租界之起源，係在道光二十七年。第一任領事爲敏體尼蔭今大世界前自北往南之路稱　體尼蔭路者，卽紀念此領事也。法人最初租得之地極小，僅有兩畝三分八厘五毫，至道光二十九年春，法租界始正式成立，其面積約五十六公頃左右，其界限如下：南至城河，北至洋涇濱，西至關帝廟褚家橋，東至潮洲會館，沿河至洋涇濱東角。法租界協定中，並訂明「倘若以後地方不够，再議別地，隨至　議」。法租界旋於咸豐十一年擴充一次，其面積約增加三公頃之譜，於光緒二十六年又二次擴充，其面積又增一千一百十二畝，連前共一百四十四公頃，民國三年又第三次擴充，租界面積達一千零二公頃，較諸初起時，擴大至二十倍矣。</p>
<p>公共租界的行政，爲工部局所治理。工部局之組織系統，上有納稅外人會，由該會產生董事會，由董事會組織各種事業委員會。武事會下，設一總裁，主持總辦間，總辦間所屬事務爲商團，爲警務處，爲火政處。爲衛生處，爲工務處，爲學務處，爲財務處，爲情報處等。</p>
<p>工部局董事現爲十四人，華五，英五，美二，日二。設總董副總董各一人。華董之設置，係　經奮鬥，于民國十九年時始告實現者也。董事會决定工部局之重要行政，並有聘任或辭退局中職員之　。每二週或三週舉行會議一次，平時如遇重要公文，均分送各董事批注意見</p>
<p>法租界之行政機關爲公董局，局董初由法領所任命後依同治五年及七年公董局之組織法，而改爲選舉制；民國十六年一月，又公布新組織法，以臨時委員會代替董事會。委員會中有華董五人，華委三人。華董五人之參加，亦係民國十六年國民革命勝利後，公董局章程修改後之决定。</p>
<p>公董局內部之組織，約分五部：（一）總營理部，（二）市政總理部內分一，政務秘書處，二，財務訟事處，三，地產處，四，分類營業處，五，鹽務處，六，衛生救濟處，七，宰牲場，八，敎育處，（三）技政總管部：（一）一般技術研究處，（二）無綫電台，信號台，天文台，（三）消防隊，（四）種　培養處，（五）公共工稈處，（四）司法顧問部，【五】警務總監部。</p>
<p>上海租界法院有三種：一爲領事法庭，二爲領事公堂，三爲特區法院。領事法庭係根據領事裁判權而設立·領事公堂則係由若干國領事所組織，係根據同治八年之地皮章程而設立者，特區法院前身爲會審公堂，權力均操諸外人之手，民國十六年經江蘇省政府交涉而收囘設臨時法院，民國十九年，更由國民政府外交部代表與英，美，荷蘭，挪戚，巴西五國代表，在南京簽立關於上海公共租界內中國法院之協定，法國代表旋亦補行簽字。上海公共租界之臨時法院取消，而於四月一日成立江蘇上海特區地方法院及江蘇高　法院第二分院。民國二十年七月二十八日，中國政府與法國簽訂法租界內中國法院恊定四條附件七條，隨卽依據協定·在法租界設立江蘇上海第二特區地方法院曁江蘇高等法院第三分院各一所。</p>
<h3 id="c41">上海的博物院 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>書籍所紀載之事事物物，車載斗量，設無實物以資證明，則人　之活動痕跡，只成爲紙上之空文，因是而有博物館之制度，所以輔圖書之缺也。上海博物館之創始·當推天主敎法國神甫韓德於淸同治六年　所創立之徐家匯博物院，其次爲皇家亞洲文會北中國支會於同治十三年所創設之上海博物院。上海市政府　於博物館之重要於民國二十二年秋，動議建設博物館於市中心，二十六年正式開幕，上海始有國人市立博物館焉。茲將上海之三大博物館分別述其經過如次。</p>
<p>（一）韓德博物院（震旦博物院）</p>
<p>德神甫爲一生物學家·於同治六年十二月至滬，見徐家匯天主堂中已略略收藏生物樹本，决定加以　充而成立一博物館。韓神甫蒞滬未久，卽　中國內地考察·而於長江流域，尤加注意，每次返　必有大量奇異標　　　。爲搜集麋鹿，特往西北各地，所得成績，極爲巨大，其「說鹿」一書，已成爲世界生物學著名之一矣·光緒九年，始建院舍於徐家　耶穌會總院之南，貯藏標本，每日午後，准人參觀不取遊資。當時樓下貯獸類及魚鳥骨骼，樓上貯甲蟲，貝介，獸類之剝製。禽鳥及蛇類。韓神甫主持此院凡三十年，嗣後由柏永年神甫主任後爲　松材神甫主任，今爲鄭璧爾利甫所主持，惟松神甫仍在院中任研究員。</p>
<p>日積月累，標本愈集愈多·舊舍不敷應用，乃於民國十九年與工建築大規模之院舍於震旦大學地址內。院凡三層，每層總長度約爲八十公尺，內分陳列三，以及研究室，試驗室，圖書室，攝影室等。院舍之南，另闢柿物園一所，培植花木，以供研究。民國二十二年冬開放，規定每星期日·一·三·四·五·六各日之下午二時至五時爲　觀時間，門券二角·今所公開展覽者，爲第一第二陳列室。第一陳列室中所陳列者爲中國古物。此種古物係土山　育嬰堂葛修士所蒐集。古物分金屬類，玉器類，陶瓦類·及刺　等物。室之北端陳列崇明謝家鎭黃泉口之遺形，最爲引人注意。泉口係淸順治舉人，卒於康熙十六年。民國六年時其後裔掘其墳，屍未杇，衣表如新，夫人林氏亦然。柩爲　修士所得，以木塑泉口像，穿以原有之殮衣，撈置柩中各物。所陳列之刺　一件，爲上海名物顧繡之一種，所謂空繡是也。第二陳列窒爲生物，如犀熊彘鹿之哺　類·鳥類·爬蟲類·兩棲類·魚類·軟體動物類·昆蟲·均具備。鳥類標本，裝置精美，栩栩欲活，昆蟲標本亦極考究，蓋該館近正注意昆蟲之工作也。植物標本另闢植物專室，共有標本五萬件。又該館所出之各種書籍，極其充實，頗得世界專門學者所欽佩。</p>
<p>（二）上海博物院</p>
<p>上海博物院在公共租界博物院路二十號亞洲文會北中國支會四樓及五樓。該院創立於同治十三年，迄今己六十餘年。歷任名譽監院，多係博物學家與生物學家，現任名譽血皖沙韋佩尤爲巨擘。故院中陳列品多爲生物標本，雖美術品與古物亦屬不少。物品來源及地域，物多屬中國，蓋該院係以研究中國爲對象者也。該院第一任名譽監院爲朴來阿。光緒元年十月初七日申報曾有新聞紀這該院云：</p>
<p>「泰西各大城池夙有成例，凡在該地方人，必公建一院，將飛禽走獸以及各物並列於內，以便博物者隨時賞玩。如在府城，則將國郡之物實之；如在都城，則將天下之物實之，名曰博物院。現在旅居上海之西商亦倣效泰西規　，在本埠設立一院，將中國與東洋各物齊集院中，事雖創始，而所羅列者已不少。計屬毛蟲者，有震澤湖旁之野猪；羽族者，有鷹鵲麻雀等；又有水埃中各物，不能殫述。餘如　螳，蚱，蝴蝶之類亦各分其種，各標其名。每一物件係從何處得來，何人相增，必書明懸貼於上。中外人有往觀者，俱不取值也。珍藏羽毛各類，西國向有妙法，雖皮己乾枯，而毛可不落。現在此法，華人已得之；且又從外國購到玻璃眼睛，故無論是何異獸珍禽。一經裝點，便栩栩然大有生氣。凡院內一切，俱係博物之西人所供給。其總理斯事者，卽元芳祥行朴萊阿君也。」</p>
<p>博物院路，原名係圓明園路，租界市政當局以重視該院之故，乃卽改今名。自光緒二年起，工部局并按年捐款補助該院。</p>
<p>（三）上海市博物館</p>
<p>上海市博物館之建議，時在民國二十二年之秋。其經費係出自公債中，劃定該館建築費爲三十萬元。其建築外觀與圖書館相倣，位于圖書館之對面。兩館遙遙相對。適成市政府之左右兩翼。二十四年春，該館籌備會推定一臨時董事會管理之。董事長爲葉恭綽氏。葉氏素愛好藝術，且善于治理事務，故主持該館、遊刃有餘。董事會中决定該館性質。以藝術歷史爲主，而歷史尤須以上海爲中心。</p>
<p>該館建築工程於二十四年雙十節告竣。其內部佈置，大略如次。（一）地面層，中央入口處爲門廳，寬約十七公尺半，長約十四公尺，登樓之梯級及衣帽售品等室附焉。由此向內爲大廳，實約十一公尺半，長約十八公尺。廳中陳列鄉賢陸深石刻四大方，壁間懸上海名物顧織掛幅十二幅，復置二鐘，鐘能指示上海時間與世界各國時間對照。大廳內爲　一陳列室。廳兩旁爲廊。兩廊均陳列上海各種之文献。廊邊前部左右兩翼之辦公室。左實突出處爲　書館，右　突出處爲演講。（二）第二層，中央分兩部；前爲藝術部置一大傀儡戲台，後部爲歷史部陳列服飾，用具，音樂，刺　，而歷代髮結模形，尤引人注意，兩廊亦爲歷史部陳列物。兩翼光綫最好，則陳列書　磁噐鋼器陶器，爲藝術部集中點。（三），中央二層：前面陳列廳之上有夾層，地面與後半部平屋頂相齊，由此循露天梯級達第四層之門樓·門樓四週亦設平台，以便遠眺·大廳之下有地室，爲設　鍋爐等之用。民國二十五年四月間，該館以中國建築展覽會揭幕，參觀者人山人海，成極佩嘆·二十六年一月，該館正式公開，滬上中外人士前往參觀者日數千，市中心　車馬不絕於　·七月七日爲上海市紀念日，市政府所屬機關協力舉行各種展覽會，以爲慶祝。該館所舉行者，爲上海文獻展覽會，出品精良，且有系統，最爲各界所讚美，不圖是日卽爲倭寇製造蘆溝橋事變，發動侵華戰爭之時。不久·八一三上海戰事發生，該館陳列品雖先事遷出若干，然大件如石　以及各種模形，例如陳列於地面層後廳之老上海三大產業（漁·棉·鹽）標本模形等，以搬運不便，悉留置館內，今則想早己成爲刻灰矣。</p>

<h3 id="c48">上海的錢荘業 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>上海的錢莊業，在中國的金融界中，是佔有極重要的位置的。它具有悠久的歷史。在海通以前，己有錢莊產生，原來百年以前的上海。已經是南北航運的要　，舉凡江浙兩省米的北運，東北雜粮的南來，都以上海爲集合的中心，帆檣如林，貿易頻繁，債款的收解，資金的運用，自然需要第三者出來務服，於是錢莊的組織。便應運而生，迨後它緊跟上海的進展，也便日趨發展，而今則已隨眘時代的演進，而與銀行業同居金融的重心了。</p>
<p>上海的錢，有『匯劃』，『跳打』，『錢兌』的分別，匯劃錢莊便是上海市錢業同業公會的會員錢莊，「跳打」錢莊是沒有資格加入公會的，雖則他們業務和　劃莊相著得極有限。「跳打』錢莊復有元亨利貞四種，是以其資本地位的差異來分別的。至於『錢兌』錢莊則是錢莊業中資本最少，範圍最小的組縐，與匯劃，跳打根本兩樣。</p>
<p>上海的錢莊業的重心，是寄訐在匯劃莊身上的，所以要談錢莊業，便該說匯劃莊。</p>
<p>匯劃莊的費本額，在早期有二萬兩三萬兩，已可算得是規模宏大的了。而今則不然，十萬，二十萬，不足爲奇，五十萬，一百萬的也有好幾家。它的組織，都屬合夥性質。在開始營業前，須得先入公會。加入公會的時候，照例須將資本總額，股東姓名，所佔股份，呈送公會，經全體會員代表審查合格，投票表决，方得通過，限制甚嚴，不是身家設　的股東，信譽卓著的阿大先生，是難望通過的。而錢莊本身有形資本的多或寡，　是次要不足重視的問題。不過近年來各錢莊爲　基礎更形鞏固起見，其資本額比較往昔，已經增加倍蓰了。</p>
<p>銀莊的所在，過去南市多在裏馬路一帶，北市則在後馬路一帶（寗波路），因爲他們營業的對象，和莊與莊間的交往便利之故。不過晚近則多廠集在北市，南市方面則興年俱少了，原因是：商業多在北市。</p>
<p>錢莊的任務，當然是繁榮市面和扶植商務，所以他們與各業商人　的關係很深切，而往來信用放款，則爲錢莊的早期主要營業課目，現在錢莊的業務，因爲有過專營信用放欵失敗的經驗，已不復固於舊時，範　，換句話說：過去錢莊之偏重商業一隅，所有放貸款項，全　經理（阿大先生）和跑街的調查和經驗，客戶內容的良　，信用的優劣，經營的得失，都可以隨人與人間感情上而　　爲良，轉劣為優，轉失爲得的，這　營業方針，誰也感覺到，在現代的社會是行不得的，是具有危　性的。所以他們也便轉變方針，進而兼爲社會服務了，如活期存款的收受，保險業務的設置，信託事業的舉辦，和倉　業務的經營，也有相當的歷史了。</p>
<p>上海市錢業同業公會，便是過去的錢業公會所親化而成的，它組織的宗旨是在增進社會的福利，和維護同業利益。但在早期也和其他公所組織一樣，祗不過　作同業春秋祭祀的聚集場所之用，迨後，因有時代的鞭策，　成功是同業中的謀利益的組織，和匯劃柝放的所在（二）八時候，　應付那時動盪的局而，他們纔于同業公會之下，設立錢業準備庫。錢業準備庫除保管同業聚集的財產外，兼爲同業理收解，通柝放。錢　準備　的組織，不但挽救了當時錢莊業的危險，而且也安定了當時整個金總市場的人心。在錢莊業歷史中，是有不可磨滅的功續和寶貴的記錄的。</p>
<p>上海錢莊業的同人在八一三事變之後，對於抗戰工作，也曾提供不少勞力。然而因錢業中人，個性差不多都好靜，不好動，所以直接的表現却甚有限，以此而竟爲人所遺忘，這是很可憾的</p>
<p>法西斯巨　帶來的戰神，已將舊中國的一切，燬壞無遺，上海的錢莊業，當然不能例外，而能逃免這被侵略的巨幼。所以現在他們也正遭着需要艱苦困難的命運。同時過去上海的錢莊業的基礎是建立在江浙兩省的，而今江浙兩省的富庶之區，却化成廢墟，他們已深深的感覺到本身的寄託已經失去。將來的命運頗爲可怕，所以準備根據這血的敎訓，圓謀開發內地的工作，藉求本身的昭　，事業的新生了。</p>

<p>— 丁勞</p>
<p>——　報珍貴的体育史——</p>
<p>斯巴達</p>
<p>斯巴達本族的八口、僅僅祗有九千人、比校下一級的平民倒有十二萬人、更下級的奴隸、竟達二十二萬人之多。這樣少數的人要駕御多數、故有特別提倡尙武敎育的必要了。在紀元前七百六七十年的期間、斯巴達底土族裏、出了一個偉人名　Lycvrgus、他爲斯巴達規定憲法、呌作Khcru、憲法的唯一目的、就是提倡國防、使國民好勇善戰、說死如歸、所向無敵的精神、其中關於兒童的取捨法、實在是能令人起奇異的感想、</p>
<p>（一）兒童的鑑定、憲法對於兒童有取捨法之規定、市民生了子女、須先呈報於國立試騐場、場中舉市民之年長而且公正者爲撿查官、對於嬰兒施以嚴格的檢查、如若檢查官認爲身體强健、將來可作國家干城者、則命其父母去養育、若認爲羸弱不堪造就的、則棄諸Laygctosi麓山的Apostns洞中、雅典市民生子女、也要受撿查官的檢查、惟檢查身體認爲贏弱時、須與其父母商量得其同意、然後棄之、並不如斯巴達絕對要守國家的法令、</p>
<p>雕刻在古玩器皿上之古代五項運動</p>
<p>（二）兒童的養育、國家所許可養育的兒童、六歲以前、在家庭由父母養育、注重他身體的鍛練、一到七歲時、就要離開家庭、入共同的敎育所、受奴隸身分的敎師、Padapog的訓練、養成恤守規律的習慣、於一羣兒童中、每羣分組、每組以最勇敢最有氣慨者爲組長、組內許多兒童要絕對的服從他、這時敎育完全是養成守紀律、尙協同柔順、服從、等德性、自十五歲後、把這羣兒童都遷移到別的敎育所裏去、敎育的方法、與前相同、十八歲以上的靑年、體操以外、受特殊的軍事訓練、直到三十議、始能結婚、但也不能隨意出入敎育所、</p>
<p>（三）敎科、斯巴達的敎科、無論是讀書、算術、各部都不及體操的重要、卽如昔樂、也單單唱宗敎的愛國的民謠、或追懷古代英雄的事蹟都是鼓舞國民底志氣的、那種靡靡動聽的音樂、是絕對葉止的、體操以外、其他如賽跑、跳遠、跳高、角力、投鐵餅標槍等、也很注重、尤以賽跑爲最普遍、而賽跑又分爲武裝與徒手兩種、至於使用武器偵察敵情、爲敎科中必要科目、總之、一切敎科以　鍊强頑的身體、養所峻嚴的自尊心、能够忍耐戰時困苦爲目的、可稱軍事訓練爲中心的敎育法、是一種意志主義敎育、不是注重智識的敎育、因此、什麽事情、務要簡潔明略、那使人愉快的音樂、淫　動人的文字、都棄之如遺、後世稱他們寫出來的文字、號爲Lacnoia體是一種乾燥得毫無趣味的文體、最詫異的、就是對於靑年學生的考查忍痛的試騐法其法在祭日的壇上敎師可以隨意鞭撻學生、若打時　一聲痛、大家便認爲沒也息的傢伙、如果打得流血滿地、口不呼痛、面不改色、大可博得羣衆的讚賞、就是被打的父母在旁、也覺得十分光榮、决不會起憐憫心的、卽使因此打死、敎師也不會犯罪的、</p>
<p>（四）衣食斯巴達的人短髮跣足、絕不修飾、體操的時候、又多裸體、卽平日所穿衣服不論冬夏、　許穿上下衣服一件、入浴不許塗油　眼也不擇地方、取河邊極粗劣的遭荻的穗作被、至於食呢、限制得竟不能一鮑、如忍不住飢餓時、不妨盜竊、如果手段拙劣、被人發覺時要受很嚴重的責罰、我且舉兩個故事、可窺見斯已達對於食物的不堪、</p>
<p>（1）有一天國王與靑年會食、食物之壞、至不能下咽、或嘆食物無味、國王就說、你要食物有味道、須要加兩種東西進去、兩種什　呢、疲勞和飢渴、（2）Plutasch記一偭少年竊狐的故事、被狐破肚皮、連陽子都流出來了、他始終不肯出聲而死、</p>
<p>（五）女子敎育斯巴逢底法律、女子是沒有戶主資格的、不過是國家的所有物、同男子一樣地施以軍事敎育、但他們很自由且受國人底尊重、不分尊卑貪富的、因爲她們能產生强健的國民負國家唯一責任的緣故、至二十歲以後、始行結婚、男女之間的界線、雖不甚嚴格、但比諸雅典不許出門的婦女的品性反爲純潔、注意國事、比自己的生命都還要重、他們送夫或子出征的送別辭、竟成了一句很普遍的格言「你携盾（木旁）而歸、否則乘盾（木旁）而歸」、這句當時的口頭禪遂成爲千古的格言、　（二）</p>

<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>本屆全國敎育會議、對於體育敎育的改進、揭示着十七個原則、凡體育行政的確立、體育經費的支給、學校體育的改進、社會體育的推行、體育師資的培養等等、都有著明確的製定、行見在此十七原則下製定的體育方案、必能一改以往各自爲政、貴放化、選手化的體育、而為一脈相承、大衆化、普遍化的體育、使任何民衆、都能獲得體育敎育的效益、鞏固抗戰建國的基礎、是可以預卜的、不過筆者以爲原則中禾曾明白規定而爲編訂方案時必須顧到的、尙有數事、筆而出之、質諸我體盲界的先知腎達、</p>
<p>一、改進學校體育必須規定中心敎材的進度——案中關於學校體育、小學以發　活潑自然的天性樹立健全公民的基礎爲目標、中學以培養應用的技術、完成自衛衛國的任務爲目標、大學以保持運動興趣、信守良好習慣爲目標、　言明論、從事體育敎育者應當奉爲金科玉律、今後體育的實施、必須針對目標、採用　切的材料和方法、是無疑義的、</p>
<p>我國學校體育、推行了幾十年、仍無成效可言、原因雖多、但敎者各自爲政、敢巧省事是佔大部分、過云體育敎材、大都依敎者的好尚、敎者擅足球的就敎足球、擅籃球的就敎籃球、推而至於一切、都是如此、敎材的支配、更無所謂難易、無所謂進展、不論學校的等次、學級的高低、都是千篇一律、因此學生認爲天下事最簡單的、莫過於體育、才生出輕視的心理、造成玩忽的風尙、效果也無從說起了、</p>
<p>任何科學、莫不有一定的進度、敎材時時　換新環境、學者自然不覺無味、敎材有易亦有難、學者自然不覺玩忽、體育敎育、要免除過去的弊病、也必須要由全國最高體育行政機關、選擇適合於當前環境的材料、作爲中心敎村、分析它的動作、按各級學校班次的高低、編訂有系統的進度大綱通令全國學校運照施行、全國學校再斟酌情形、按照大網、褊訂各學級的敎材進度細目、依次敎學、除了中心敎材而外、其餘一切敎材、都作爲輔助敎材、學生最低限度、必須按照進度、學會中心敎材的動作、倘能力充裕、中心敎材的勁作容易學會的、就可以盡量採用輔助敎材、</p>
<p>要規定中心敎材的意思、一則因爲運動的種類太多、沒有一個中心敎材、要學生樣樣都學會、能力不够的、勢力不能、一則因爲旣有進度、動作必須具體、有許多運動、往往只有成績可分高下、動作無法別難易的倘求進度而僅僅更換項目、就失了進度的眞義、具備具體動作的運動、莫過於國術和活潑器械操——雙　、單　、木馬、跳箱、墊上運動等——兩類、它們的動作、不但難易分明、眞實可以規定具體的進度、並且能養成應用的技術、冒險的習慣、勇敢的精神、適應抗戰環境、</p>
<p>我國今日的學生、能够自動注意體育訓練的、還是少數、要使它們個個能獲得體育訓練的實益、督促工夫是不能少、校的學倘有這了</p>

<p>主人譪客的時候、最無趣的事情、就怕是入席禾到半途、客人巳現出意興欄珊的模樣吧、</p>
<p>主人在無可奈何惰形之下、只好拿出古董式的電影雜誌來、這種書的日子、還是印着一九一四——一九一八年出版幾個字的模樣、在這種書裏、還可看到葛蘿莉史璜生投在她丈夫華蕾斯皮萊的懷抱裏、和曼麗璧克馥緊拉着一個逃犯不放的照片、來這結果也能使客人們僅地有些啼笑皆非的樣子、</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥做請客東道的時候、每喜在宴席散後、來講一張她請客看她自己造的一個小型花園戲院的電影、講完了再來奏一個昔樂的挿曲、然後讓客人們自己隨意去談笑遊玩、</p>
<p>近來一般男人們都想探問他們女朋友在廚房裏工作的情形、</p>
<p>葛蘭貸弗蕾兒有一個全用電氣的廚房、設在她的演戲室裏、所用燙牛奶、洗碟子的器皿都是　當來推動的、有一次、葛蘭黛淸客人們在星期日宴會裏聚餐、她敎他們烹飪的方法、並且當場剝大蒜給他們瞧、</p>
<p>桃樂賽拉　也是個歡喜帶他的客人去參觀廚房的一個女人、她尤其高興給他們瞧太妃糖、軟糖、和玉蜀黍糖的製造法、</p>
<p>史都歐文請客的時候、總歡喜拿出留聲機和二十年　的唱片來一張一張的唱給他客人聽、</p>
<p>奧托克勞淦則歡喜用鋼琴奏出幾只現代流行的歌曲來娛賓客、瓊斐納每有客人在家裏的時候、總要叫他們選出古代十個艷后來、讓他們自由的對每個皇后評　和比較、喬治彭斯和葛萊西亞倫在朋友面前、簡直要化掉許許多多的錢來成功一個偉大的表演節目、</p>
<h3 id="c59">蘇聯的兒童電影 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯電彩在形式與內容上的進前、巳爲世界所公認、最近蘇聯又以十二分的努力、注意到「兒童電影』、並且已經有了很好的表現、根據婦女與兒童的新五年計劃、一九三八年的出品、兒童影片佔百分之二十五、</p>
<p>蘇聯的兒童影片、不僅完全映給兒童看、並且完全是兒童所演成的、</p>
<p>然而、在蘇聯的好萊塢、正像成人影片　視明星制度一樣、兒童影片中也沒有兒童、不需要秀蘭鄧波兒那樣號召觀衆、蘇聯的兒童演員在完成了第一張片子後、便須脫離演員的生活、不得續演第二張、因爲蘇聯的當局不願意有個別的兒童得享盛名、大出風頭、</p>
<p>蘇聯的兒童演員、雖然不能够續演第二部片子、他們在銀幕上的期間雖然很短促、可是做兒童演員的條件却十二分嚴格、不是隨隨便便的、大導演愛森斯坦爲了一個演員、曾經測騐過三千農村兒童、方才選到一個、</p>
<p>所謂兒童影片、原是一個總稱、兒童影片還按照着兒童的年齡、而各異其形式與內容、譬如說、給年齡最幼的兒童們所看的影片、往往是故事類、配以特殊的音樂、給八歲到十二歲兒童所看的影片、又往往是以無線電控制船艘的新發明等、給十二歲以上兒童所看的影片、則都有劇本的說明書、不但兒童電影的攝製、要適合年齡不同的兒童們的需要、是兒童電影院的構造、也要配合他們的條件、莫斯科現在巳經有八家專供兒童觀看的電影院、所設的座椅、其高度都隨着年齡而不同、</p>
<p>在　　兒童電影的邊　中、最革命的一點是、沒有一個兒童演員知道鏡頭在甚麽地方、換一句話說、他們在做戲的時候、却不知道自己是在做戲、這樣的表演、真使一個天眞兒童的心理和個性的表現、一揮無餘了、當然要比秀蘭鄧波兒的　腔作勢、逈然不同啦、</p>

<p>— 灝</p>
<p>魯迅先生名著阿Q正傳、內容係描寫中國國民性、十分透澈、以前曾有不少劇團試排、但皆因演員過多和主角難覓而流產、</p>
<p>現在上海話劇界聯合十餘劇學、共同舉行義賣公演、由工華劇團主持、共排名劇六種、阿Q範圍最大、所以由工華、精武、益友、保聯、四劇團聯合排演、公演後票價所得、將悉數捐助難胞、地點或假蘭心大戲院、或租璇宮舞廳、演期定六月十五日左右、雖然以前曾因問題難以解决而流產、但是他們爲了顧全難胞生活、寗願献自己的精神和物力、爲難胞請命、此種精神殊爲可嘉、且此次出演人員——連工作人員在內　約百餘人、內中正不乏優秀者、所以演出成績、定可預卜精彩、</p>

<p>平均每日費百六十六鎊　爲瑙門逮轉船上賓之一</p>
<p>『瑙門遠』郵船（LinerNormandie）自紐約啓椗出發、這次是個奢豪的航行、據聞出於預料之外、因爲船上計有旅客七百四十三人、類皆富商之輩、其中大半、都係百萬以上之財主、全船旅客、合計付出旅費、共有二十萬鎊之鉅、銀幕溜冰明岸宋雅海妮、亦爲旅客之一、船抵英屬西印度「勃哈茂」羣島Bahamas之『納賽』Nassau城時、她與她的扈從一行、卽在該處登陸、她所包定的艙價、需費一千五百鎊、</p>
<p>宋雅海妮一行六人、內有她的母親兄弟及二　人、　以尼從的旅費而論、亦需一千八百鎊、至於宋雅海妮個人所費三千三百鎊的帳單中、對於對外費用、尙不包括在內、</p>
<p>『瑙門逮』準備駛往南美及西印度一帶、這次二十萬磅的航行、爲期僅有廿四天、</p>
<p>這次船上所耗的香權酒、以及各式名貴的美酒、爲數不知幾百加侖、這有許多山珍海味、精美餐食、均由極負盛譽的庖丁、隨船烹調、因爲這次登程的豪客佳賓、是爲歷來旅客名單上、所不常見的人物、</p>
<p>宋雅海尼、飲食　腴、舉止豪華、不愧爲一個標率的富女、現年廿六歲、每星期可得薪金一千磅、這次個人的演出、在美國的游程上需費八萬鎊、</p>
<p>在她這次的游稈中、單是絲襪一項、須化五百鎊、在她溜冰時所穿的絲綢緊身衣、每套價須七餅、但她每天須換穿五次、</p>
<p>這個奢豪的旅費、宋雅海平均每天須化一百六十六鎊、但照她每日的進益而論、這個支出的數額、並不算是出超哩、</p>

<h3 id="c64">沒本錢生意 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>一起沒本錢生意，人們腦筋裏便會聯想到搶劫，因為只要拳頭大，臂膊相，或者手裏有刀槍，你就可以變為我的，這生意的不需要本錢，是大家都知道的。</p>
<p>然而搶刦畢竟是犯重法的，捉到了輕則幾年徒刑，重則請你過你十八年再做一個小夥子，因些這生意起初雖然不要本錢，後來所付的利錢，却太爲可觀了。有些聰明人，於是便想出另外一種方法，比校輕易不冒大險的方法，偷竊。</p>
<p>街頭剪綹摸袋，是小焉者也；挪用公款，私造賬目，是大焉者也，這些，破了案並沒有性命之憂，而出息的好，却遠在搶刦之上，大爲一般避電就輕的小小冒險家所歡迎。和偷竊一樣沒本錢，而其結果有異同曲工之妙的，則爲開賭。</p>
<p>開了賭固然可以袖頭，更可以憑着巧妙的手殷，做莊家擺出有名無實的本錢，大有所得。並且輸錢的。不，送錢來的，都是自願的，雖然也是犯法的舉動，至少就少了告發的人，可以省去不少麻煩，比了搶刦不必說，比了偷竊似乎又進一步的便利了。開賭之外，其他一切掉槍花，弄手段，用騙術以取財物的，也都可以作爲沒本錢生意，最顯著的。例如道士和尙，巫覡之流，或則口中念念有詞，或則危詞聳聽，使你乖乖地拿出錢來給他化用；拆字算命，信口雌黃，敎你如何趨吉避凶，如何脫運交運，也可以作如是觀。</p>
<p>這種生意，差不多完全不犯法，穩妥的稈度，比了開賭又進一層。俗話說，騙殺人不償命，就是這個意思，不過被騙者一旦憬然覺悟，那也不免就要起糾紛，而增加麻煩。爲了百分之百的穩妥而絕無後患起見，還該另想別法。別法惟何？曰，哀求。有的沿門乞討；有的『告地狀』，有納『捍豬仔』，……只要伸出手來，或者磕下頭去，銅板幾會續續而來。銅板收入叫化袋中，卽是自己的所有品，要如何用便如何用、光明正大，絕無後患。做了三年叫化子不肯做官，此之謂也。沒本錢生意而至於求乞，似乎可謂至矣盡矣，蔑以加矣。</p>
<p>然而，求乞所得者、到底只是銅板：額外福星高照，才見角子，至於洋錢鈔票，到底是沒有的。生意雖然穩妥，而發財則太緩慢，茫無把握，假使有種生意、其穩妥與求乞相等，其發財之易則與搶劫等差不多，那就眞正是無等等咒，無上上福，一經實行，從此天下太平了。思之思之，鬼神通之，皇天不負苦心人，這種生意到底被想着了：發鈔票，發沒有準備金的鈔票。鈔票每張起碼一元，其他五元十元，以至百元千元，隨使可以印上幾個字發出，所費幾等於無，所值如此其大，在沒本錢生意佔盡風光，是確然不容懷疑的。</p>
<p>一元值一元當然是自賺的是卽使一元僅幾角，甚至值幾分，只要不跳到紙張和印刷費之下，到底還是賺的，這是沒本錢生意中的大成。不是嗎？從前俄國就發過這樣的盧布，德國也發過這模的馬克，現在雖然一文不值，在當時却救了她們的雞關。</p>
<p>不過沒本錢生意到發沒有準備金的鈔票，實在可以嘆觀止矣，那來想發財者，爲什麽又不大家都來這一手呢？原來有些天才所限，只能做做强盜或小偷，却不能做這種「理財家」，有的則雖有這種「理財家」的天才，經驗未到，還只好停在强盜或小偷的途徑上學習着。</p>
<p>並且要發財，也不能專攻一途，所謂江海之大還當不擇細流。所以一個幹大事成大業者，也往往做着小事小業，而一團體中人，要想團體的前程無限，也尤其要有人分工合作，殊途同歸，因此各種沒本錢生意，至今在爲一個人或一團體中人並行不悖着。</p>
<p>我想世界上人眞能從事於此，也許世界果然就會文明進步吧。懿歟休哉，沒本錢生意！</p>
<h3 id="c65">五分鐘　（四） <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 羅烽</p>
<p>賀靜同答這句話時，已走到敵軍司令官切近，他迎着光已經　出對方模糊的面影：那是一副兇狠的塑像，他對着那塑像發一個沈默的冷笑……</p>
<p>敵軍司令官突然把手電筒關閉了。</p>
<p>一時的沈默，便立刻陷入可怕的黑暗中。這一霎那間，他們好像互以粗暴的呼吸代替問答，馬在一旁也參加這個談話似的。</p>
<p>爲了投向死，賀錚服從敵軍司令的命令，開始單獨地向着死的路上踏去。同時，手電筒又張開它龐大的光圈，從賀錚的背後，探照到很遠的前面——前面彷彿是一條新關的小徑越往前走，路越立陡起來了。</p>
<p>雖然賀錚每邁出一步，就發一次死的懷疑，而他的决心却不斷在向死的目的邁進。他的眼請注視着光明，也留神監視着死神究竟是從哪一方面飛來。</p>
<p>他吃力地向高處爬去。現在除開脚鐐的音響有些騷亂的異動而外，一切都還是照常靜默着，賀錚心里報怨道：</p>
<p>『讓我走到哪里去呢」？死也是這樣困難的呵』！</p>
<p>然而他發覺已經走近懸崖的邊緣了。</p>
<p>「跳下去」！</p>
<p>賀錚毫不猶豫地跳出那慘白的光圈，當他的身體已經離開的懸崖的剎那，他還聽見通　員重復着喊着：</p>
<p>「跳下去」！</p>
<p>在一分鐘以後，黑暗仍然擁抱着這座險峻的荒山，彷彿一切的生物，全讓這更沉悶的夜　所窒息了……　（完）</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記—</p>
<p>第×戰區司令部，在武漢沒有放棄之前，是駐在麻城首鎭宋埠的，這里，北通商城，西扼孝感，東蔽立煌，南控武昌，恰當豫鄂皖三省的中樞；而東南跟廣濟，蘄春，武穴沿江戰區，也可以遙相呼應。在武澳外蘭戰緊張的時期，宋埠是相當的重要。我們參加一團風的火炬游行，原想由羅田入山，忍然聽到武漢文化界將往信陽勞軍的消息，並且平漢綫戰事，又正在　公山的北部進行，便決計從公路先去宋埠；如果時間允許的話，還打算到信陽，光山一行，然後取道商城囘皖。</p>
<p>當夜，就繼　踏了上征送。公路早已自動破壞了，只得借重一等脚，在朦朧月底下迅速地前行；經騐告訴我們，白天的時間，多半會浪費在躱避飛機的盲目下蛋」。倒不如晚上爽快些。「祗有五十里路。挺多六個鐘頭跑到了！」大家滿不在乎地說，「然而比長征還差遠！」有人在　　着老姚，因爲他曾經批評過西北經濟考　泰團，對杜重遠的坐車子表示不滿，所以大家時常把這句話來取笑他。</p>
<p>月亮慢慢地西沉了，黑暗吞沒了大地；但不一會，那血紅的太陽，就從山坳襄探出頭來，遠望大別山的支脉——禮山，起先是躱在白　　的離霧中，這時，已經露出了眞面目來，我們在鎭上巡禮了一囘，這才順着曲折的小路走去。</p>
<p>展開在面前的一度古廟，周圍全是高大的揚柳樹，那麽靜靜地襲動者，一羣羣的戰馬，都在嚙着地上的靑革。在廟門旁邊，就看了陳東早參議。</p>
<p>「你們剛才到的？」陳參議問。</p>
<p>「是呀！」我說。</p>
<p>「那麼，裏面去長談吧！」</p>
<p>古廟是屈姓的家祠，自沉於汨羅江的三閭大夫，就是他們的老祖宗。陳參議告訴我：政訓處全部出發了，勞軍代表幾時才到，他還沒有接到駐漢辦事處的電報，如果要往信陽去，他可以想方法弄一輛卡車來。</p>
<p>晚上，我們便寄宿在司令部，成羣結隊的蚊子，好像不肯錯過機會似的，在總動員令之下，一齊進攻了。</p>
<p>爲了不能入睡，還是哼幾句歪詩吧，詩曰：</p>
<p>聲傳刁斗　嚴阿，</p>
<p>多少健兒齊枕戈；</p>
<p>此處群又掩浩月，</p>

<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>自覺英藐小，一個人便多絕望。</p>
<p>像一個侏儒，立在「巨無霸一的前面，恭謹，拘泥，且多胆怯，侮辱像火烙過的印痕，深得使你無法自信可以洗刷。</p>
<p>百代的深仇，刻骨鉻心，傳自千萬年前的祖先，也雕鐫下許多刀瘢在每個人心的深處。侮辱的鞭痕，年年來，血凝乾了生疤，疤再淋漓化成膿腐，痛苦換來許多囘憶，像一串繩索，貫穿着侮辱的念珠。</p>
<p>侮辱不能忘記，若干年月來，堆得高而又厚，想起過往吧，那往往是一個辛酸的夢。</p>
<p>破了巢，毀了心血的一生，你的家人也許不幸會客死於異鄉，葬身於虎穴，一切的破敗與厄運，壓迫着你，使你不能喘息，沒有原諒與姑息時，切身的利害乃更甚於同情，於是你將泣血，椎心，免冠，衝髮。</p>
<p>「百代的深仇！百代的深仇！我淚如洗，我心傷悲，我懷鬱鬰。」</p>
<p>於是人人給悲愁咬嚙，眉乃緊蹙，心乃飄浮，跑乃隱痛。憤怒鼓動筯脈，但不高張；悲哀成水流，但不崩潰；火山吐露微燄，但不爆發。婦人啜泣嚶嚶，酒徒一醉千日，詩人寫成『離騷』，瞌睡蟲長眠欲死。</p>
<p>你說吧，公正的先生，這也是視顏昏瞆嗎？』</p>
<p>我不禁戚然，望着一群人如弊如癡，不曾忘記深仇，他們抑痛苦，我悲憫，默然良久。</p>
<p>恍然我領悟，於是我乃啓問：</p>
<p>「你們能否强化！化抑鬱爲咆哮：使筋脈高張，水流潰決，火山爆發，不僅鼓動，潺潺，吐燄。」</p>
<p>廣大的人羣乃試一咆哮。空氣如死，大荒如墳墓，口舌如受箝，每人皆如是想。曙光之劍或可劃破長夜，古木無人的深山中，嘹亮的長歌，亦許使楚天盡碧。於是人人各各響起歌聲，正義的歌聲。埋伏心坎中，多年懦怯的忍藏，潺弱的瘖啞，歌聲起不甚自然，有點沙沙，也有點抖索。長久的荒疎，技術稍嫌拙劣，力弱，聲低，音亂。不高亢，也不巍峨。</p>
<p>遠處有豺狼竊笑，混和着發威聲有犬吠與狼嗥。</p>
<p>豺狼竊笑稍稍終止，乃換來狂奔馳突聲，漸向咆哮之處。野蠻的騷沸，掩蓋了咆哮，人人黯然無色。『我們咆哮乃招致危機了。』膽小如鼠者面如死灰。</p>
<p>漸漸咆哮聲由低轉高，柔弱轉爲雄健，窄小轉爲寬大，織細轉爲沈雄。無邊落木端蕭，魚龍潛心細聽，江波戰慄，林獸無聲。</p>
<p>「不此昔時咆哮了。」豺狼皆驚駭不己，各各刮目相看。沒有囑笑，沒有譏訕，有的是正視與俯首。</p>
<p>奮臂而起，從此你可無虞力量的不敵，沒有仇恨，你須吞咽，沒有砂粒，你須咀嚼，沒有榛刺，你須埋藏。是仇恨，但不是無語的陰雲，微風的息息，零雨的凄其。須狂風，須暴雨，須烈火，須奔泉。一切我們須使之强化。內須開拓，靜須生動，柔使須剛，淺須能深，短須延長，暫須持久，疎須緻密。</p>
<p>一場戰門的成功，人人皆學會一種技能，鍛冶抑鬱爲咆哮：由情緒鍊成動作，長歡鍊爲戰歌。</p>
<p>像白熱的鐵鍊成純鋼：過往悲哀的人，　冶成一枝復仇的隊伍。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Visit to Commander-in-Chief Li at the Xiangfan Front <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>While in Xiangfan, Mr. Wei Chengcheng, Director of the Political Department of the Fifth War Area, led us to visit the local military-civilian club. Everything from public education to illustrated explanations of military knowledge, public entertainment, etc., was arranged in an orderly manner. The comprehensiveness of the facilities and the perfection of the management were by no means what people in the rear would imagine possible so close to the front line. The cultural work of the Ninth War Area is indeed brilliantly unique. However, there is one thing that still requires more assistance from our friends in the rear, and that is the issue of cultural sustenance. Most of their good books, magazines, and newspapers are old. Therefore, they eagerly hope that cultural circles in various places can collect some relatively excellent books and newspapers and mail them to the 32nd Postal Bureau, addressed to Mr. Wei of the Political Department. The contrast between cultural work at the front and in the rear is indeed too unequal. We often loudly advocate arming the mind and spiritual mobilization. But all of this requires spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>I stayed in Xiangfan for a total of three nights. Commander-in-Chief Li, the victorious general who gallops along the banks of the Han River, was in high spirits. He held an optimistic attitude towards the situation in the Lingge Police Bureau and the battle line along the Han River basin. This gentleman's conversation is very interesting. Any serious problem, after passing through his mouth, can immediately become a relaxed and clear "casual chat" that is easy to understand. He believes that in the five or six months after the withdrawal from Wuhan, the enemy expended great sacrifice and effort, only to achieve less than a hundred miles of progress. The strategic reason is that after the enemy's main force entered Wuhan, the border area between Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi was almost completely recovered by our army, and Wuhan was in a bitter situation of being surrounded on all sides. Mr. Li gave an example, saying, "It's like a person who is trapped in the mud. When it reaches chest height, he will naturally feel difficulty breathing and be in extreme danger. Therefore, he will try his best to push away the threats in front of him. But, little does he know, before he can let go, new pressures are being added to him even heavier and more densely." Now, although the two large pincers (of a crab) have slightly stretched in, the body is even more pressured and trapped in a deeper dead end. Commander-in-Chief Li firmly believes in the future of the Japanese military, believing that "those who commit many injustices will inevitably destroy themselves," and that Japanese imperialism will inevitably follow the same path as the World War of 1914, bringing about its own demise.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Annam issue, Mr. Li has a very profound and far-reaching understanding that general political commentators and international affairs experts have never pointed out. He feels that the safety of Annam is crucial to France's strategy and tactics. Militarily, once Annam is lost, France will no longer have a base in the Far East. Politically, the Japanese, after occupying Annam, will inevitably use the Annamese to form a government and falsely give it the beautiful name of independence. This would naturally provide a stimulating example to many other colonies. Therefore, since the Japanese imperialists occupied Hainan Island, Annam has been in an extremely critical situation. As for the method of turning danger into safety, it is not difficult. What is needed is only a very close alliance between China and France in the Far East. China has no ambition to seize Annam, a point that the French authorities can trust. With this basic belief, Sino-French cooperation in Annam will naturally be easier to achieve. Mr. Li believes that if France hopes to supply Annam with military supplies from Europe during the war, it is very unreliable. Proper preparations should be made: first, factories capable of manufacturing light weapons and ammunition should be established in Annam; second, all food and manpower issues can first have some verbal or written tacit agreement with China, because this is the best way for China and France to cooperate in practice. China has no problem with manpower and food, and France will certainly not have difficulty with one hundred to two hundred thousand pieces of military equipment. Therefore, currently, as long as France can truly feel the necessity of protecting Annam and give China a hint, we can certainly help them when necessary. The vividness of Commander-in-Chief Li's conversation lies in his ability to give examples and use analogies. Here, he similarly gave an example: "The Chinese are like a poor man. Sometimes, even if he approaches a rich man with good intentions, the French are always afraid of being touched for oil or borrowing money. In fact, this poor man is indeed not an ordinary person. He has backbone and methods. Not only does he not want to take advantage of others, but he also intends to try his best to help others in times of need. Although we have good intentions and are full of enthusiasm, the social status is not appropriate, and there is no self-recommending and capable matchmaker. Therefore, this marriage has never been consummated, and the situation in the Far East and the Pacific is deteriorating." At the same time, the Chinese national character is the most trustworthy in the world. Among friends, money and many commercial transactions rarely require contracts or agreements other than the verbal "one word is final." The other party will never breach the agreement because there is no contract or written evidence. Therefore, if France is sincere and can deeply understand this poor man, then even without any formal diplomatic treaty, just a clearer and more sincere word, we will make preparations. Mr. Li Meng believes that the French government still has many concerns about Annam. First, if too many factories are opened, the number of workers will inevitably increase, and they are afraid of causing social problems. Second, if they get too close to China, they are afraid that the Annamese will learn from the Chinese and launch a movement for freedom and independence, leading to national problems. Regarding these two points, if they are truly the French government's concerns, I think France itself does not understand Annam. What do you think?</p>
<p>The next day, I went to Longzhong, the ancient site of Zhuge Liang's thatched cottage, where he said, "I am originally a recluse in Wolong." Liu Xuande had visited the thatched cottage three times to invite this fan-wielding, turban-wearing, cart-riding friend who seemed like a celestial being. Now it has become a training ground for young students to cultivate new forces to promote Hubei's politics and war area public movements, I hope that there will be hundreds and thousands more Zhuge Liangs here.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 7th, I left Xiangfan and returned to Xuan Chang. The entire route was a famous battlefield during the Three Kingdoms period: Changyang Bridge, Changban Slope, Guan Tomb. Unfortunately, my pen is too clumsy and unskilled, otherwise I would really like to write an essay lamenting Zhao Zilong's bravery on Changban Slope. Although it is difficult to say whether it has much significance, his seven entries and seven exits from the enemy's encirclement, alone and single-handedly, with his heroic and majestic spirit, were extremely pleasing.</p>
<p>From Yichang to Shashi, crossing Dongting Lake to Changsha. Due to transportation difficulties and accompanying four foreign friends, I became quite exhausted. After arriving in Changsha, I had to immediately set up camp and only slept at twelve o'clock that night. When I woke up the next morning, I realized that my temperature had risen to 40 degrees Celsius. Thanks to everyone's blessings, I have now recovered my health!</p>
<p>Today I am leaving Changsha for Mount Heng.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Eastern River in Arduous Battle <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Rao Qiumei</p>
<p>Although the enemy has withdrawn from Huibo, they are still entrenched in the Dongguan, Shilong, and Zengcheng areas. This part of the enemy still harasses the Huibo border from time to time: Zhangmutou, Fuhexu, Lianhexu, and Longbizhen and other places are burned and plundered by the enemy time and again. This shows that the Eastern River is still at war, and at the same time, when the enemy plans and implements a new offensive against Guangdong, the Eastern River is again under the threat of this new offensive.</p>
<p>Because the Eastern River is at the front of the war, is in the war, the people of the Eastern River have already begun to use "struggle" to meet this environment, which is the driving force to push the Eastern River forward.</p>
<p>Here we can see:</p>
<p>1.  The Development of Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>When the enemy occupied Huibo, the people of Huibo had already partially attacked the enemy. More than 200 enemy troops attempting to flank Conghua from the small road from Boluo to Longmen were completely annihilated by the people of Boluo and Longmen. When the enemy withdrew from Huibo, more than 200 enemy troops were wiped out in one fell swoop in the mountainous area around Fuhexu in Boluo (our side only suffered one injury in this battle). The Fuhexu Self-Defense Corps also shot down an enemy bomber, killing six pilots. Subsequently, guerrilla warfare was constantly being launched around Zhengguo, Lianhe, and other market towns at the foot of Luofu Mountain, and various forms of struggle emerged. There are stories of elderly women in their sixties stealing guns to lure the enemy, jokes about sneaking into enemy camps at night to steal machine guns and accidentally bringing home motorcycles, and more than 20 people pretending to be women working in the fields to lure and kill enemies. In small-scale battles, groups of three or five infiltrated enemy-occupied casinos to carry out various small-scale activities. Most praiseworthy is the Zengcheng guerrilla team of more than 100 people under Shan Rongpei, who penetrated deep into the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, repeatedly attacking the enemy's transportation lines, and once used the terrain to engage in a battle with more than 300 enemy troops for an entire morning. The Boluo guerrilla team under Chen Jie has fought more than ten battles, large and small, against the enemy under the personal leadership of Chen Mingtou (Chen Laotou, around 70 years old, is a self-made man and an old Kuomintang member in good health). Lianhe Township Chief Lai personally led the people of the township, not only severely cracking down on the enemy's invasions, but also repeatedly attacked enemy camps at night, causing great losses to the enemy. As a result, under the enemy's "deep hatred," he was betrayed by a traitor from the township. One night, more than ten members of his family were brutally murdered, and his wife and daughter were sexually assaulted. Chief Lai himself was tied to a cross in the enemy area and had pieces of his flesh cut off for three days before he died. The enemy used all cruel and inhuman means to deal with the leading figures and all combatants in our guerrilla teams, but this only deepened the hatred and animosity of our people towards the enemy, making guerrilla warfare on the Eastern River front and behind enemy lines more widespread!</p>
<p>2.  Mobilizing Eastern River Youth</p>
<p>Although the youth of various counties in the Eastern River are in a difficult environment, they have already been mobilized. First, let's talk about two young and combative teams:</p>
<p>I. The Eastern River District Team of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard of Eastern Youth, referred to as "Anti-Vanguard." This team of about 70 people, after withdrawing from Guangzhou, accepted the guidance of the Mass Mobilization Committee of the Fourth War Area and set out to work in the Eastern River. At that time, the enemy was still in Huibo. This team had already gathered in Heyuan and worked in the areas of Puqian, Shiba, Guzhu, and Guansige on the Huibo border, actively training self-defense groups and helping local people run self-defense group training classes. In the work areas, local teams of "Anti-Vanguard" were organized. It is estimated that more than 1,000 "Anti-Vanguard" members were organized in the counties of Hui, Chai, He, Longchuan, and Xinfeng. These "Anti-Vanguard" members can almost all play a considerable role in promoting and setting an example for the local national salvation work.</p>
<p>II. The Eastern River Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps is directly subordinate to the Nanyang Huizhou Ten-Prefecture Overseas Chinese Association. A general headquarters was established, and a branch was established in each county, with the purpose of assisting local governments in doing anti-war mobilization work and all possible wartime service work. Currently, the first regiment in Huizhou, with more than 100 members, is the most powerful, the second regiment in Huaiyuan, with more than 40 members, and the third regiment in Fu Luo, with more than 40 members, are working in the vicinity of the war zone. The fourth regiment in Chaihui, with more than 20 members, the fifth regiment in Heyuan, and the sixth regiment in Longchuan, with more than 10 members. Other counties such as Heping, Lianping, and Jiangxi have not yet established service corps. In addition, there is a rescue team of more than 20 people and a mobile drama troupe of more than 20 people. If these three to four hundred young cadres can all be actively deployed in a planned way to carry out work in various fields, they will make valuable contributions to the Eastern River.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the organizational status of the youth in various counties. Haifeng, Lufeng, Wuhua, and Heyuan all have County Youth Anti-Japanese Comrades Associations. Haifeng has the largest number of organized members, with more than 2,000 people. Wuhua also has more than 1,000 people. Longchuan has a unified organization of the County Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard. The youth of Heping are mostly organized in the Farmers' Resistance Association. It is said that the Heping Farmers' Resistance Association has about 5,000 members. Then, there is no doubt that the maximum number of 4,000 members should belong to the youth. The development of Huiyang and Boluo is uneven, and there is still no unified organization in the county, but the organized youth always number one to two thousand. The wartime work team of the Boluo County Government with more than 20 people and the wartime work team of the Heyuan County Anti-Japanese Support Association with more than 70 people are both excellent fighting teams that can work independently, endure hardship, and go deep into the masses.</p>
<p>3.  Front Line, Heart, and Rear</p>
<p>According to the current geographical conditions of the Eastern River and the distribution of enemy and our forces, the front line of the Eastern River is Huibo, the heart is Heyuan, Longchuan, Lianping, and Heping is the rear (of course, not the great rear), and several central points among them have an enlightened and progressive political environment.</p>
<p>The most central area of the front line is of course in Boluo. Huang Chang, the county magistrate of Boluo, is a wise county magistrate. Not being corrupt is his greatest advantage. He can also pay considerable attention to developing mass organizations, such as the county government's organization, the wartime work team, recommending Chen Jie as the commander of the guerrillas, running a cadre training school for the self-defense regiment, and changing Boluo County Middle School into a wartime middle school, serving as the principal himself. If the government can trust young people more, employ a large number of young people, and do things more effectively, guerrilla warfare will inevitably develop more widely, and Boluo's bright future is unquestionable.</p>
<p>Heyuan, which has become the heart of the Eastern River, is moving towards a bright road day by day. The new county magistrate, Wu Shijun, has not been in office for long, so it is of course too early to talk about work performance, but it is said that he is very straightforward and has few bureaucratic airs. As for the county party headquarters, it can work very actively. It can play an exemplary role in the county party headquarters of various counties in the Eastern River. Under his leadership, there is regular work in addition to working in the countryside. Under his leadership, a unified county youth anti-Japanese comrades association, a county women's association, and a county youth anti-Japanese comrades association were established. At the same time, under his leadership, a regular symposium of various national salvation organizations was established. The organizational units of this symposium include youth resistance, youth corps, women's associations, youth resistance, anti-vanguard service corps, etc. A common work program was issued, and the symposium decided on many regular tasks, publishing publications, and holding street singing, talks, and speeches every night, with each group taking turns to take charge. Training classes for young cadres are also underway.</p>
<p>Among the rear counties, Longchuan is the most central county. In terms of transportation and economy, it has become the center. In terms of the direction of the Korean War, it is relatively close to the front line. In Longchuan, both politics and mass movements have shown unusual progress. The county's unified youth congress was held after the Lunar New Year, and the "Longchuan Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard," a unified organization, was established, with County Magistrate Deng Hongqin serving as the captain himself. Under the leadership of the county magistrate, fifty self-education classes for young cadres have been held. Recently, a county primary school teacher conference has also been held, and a county primary school teacher union has been established. Longchuan's national salvation movement has not only received the leadership and support of the upper-level county government, the county party headquarters, and the general gentry, but also the enthusiastic support and help of local village associations and alumni associations.</p>
<p>The continued political progress and the vigorous development of the mass movement in the three central counties of Boluo, Heyuan, and Longchuan will inevitably be able to influence and promote the entire Eastern River situation, fundamentally transform it, grow new strength, and defeat the dark monsters. The people of the Eastern River must and are moving in this direction!</p>
<h3 id="e3">How to Mobilize Rural Women? Experience from Wartime Rural Service Team Work <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The reporter had a long talk with Mr. Chen Yiyun. Entrusted by Madame Chiang, Mr. Chen is the captain of the wartime rural service brigade of the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement Headquarters, leading more than a hundred female comrades to work in various rural areas of Hunan, and has gained a lot of valuable work experience. It may be useful to introduce them to fellow rural workers here.</p>
<p>(1) Rural work requires the greatest determination. China's countryside suffers from various diseases, not only having stubborn feudal consciousness, but also being extremely poor. For it to become healthy and participate in the war of resistance, it needs to undergo a considerable period of treatment before it can contribute the greatest strength. President Chiang instructed us that China's inexhaustible strength is indeed hidden in the vast countryside.</p>
<p>To make rural people understand the war of resistance, it is necessary to improve their level of knowledge, publish newspapers, and run women's literacy classes and children's literacy classes. To enable women to fully exert their productive power, it is necessary to set up nurseries to relieve their burden. To make villagers pay attention to hygiene, it is necessary to lead them in carrying out a major cleanup and publicize attention to family hygiene. To maintain local security and enhance the people's anti-war sentiment, it is necessary to assist in the work of eliminating traitors, using persuasion and secret reporting to overcome local corruption and encourage the people to join the army and assist the wounded soldiers. The hundred or so team members led by Mr. Chen are working hard to carry out these tasks, relying on their hard work, courage, and firm determination.</p>
<p>(2) When starting work</p>
<p>The team members, more than a hundred in number, are divided into seven squadrons, each with three platoons, each with four or five team members. Each platoon is independently scattered in various towns and townships to work. Feudal consciousness is deeply rooted in the countryside, and it is impossible to carry out work there without using various methods. First, plays and newspapers are staged in the local area to attract local attention, and then home visits are made. A service bag is carried along to gain the goodwill of the villagers through service, and self-introductions are made to dispel the villagers' suspicions about the team members.</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to gain the understanding and help of the local government, local elders, gentry, and intellectuals, and then rely on their strength to help them develop their work everywhere.</p>
<p>(3) How to encourage joining the army</p>
<p>Whenever a young man is drafted, the team members take some money, firecrackers, and meat to the draftee's home. The money is for the families of the soldiers who are going to war. The firecrackers are set off at the door of his house. Curious villagers all come to watch. At this time, the team members take the opportunity to speak to them, telling them that it is everyone's duty to voluntarily join the army and how glorious it is. This often has a great effect.</p>
<p>(4) Story of military-civilian cooperation</p>
<p>In the XX area, there are many wounded soldiers, but conflicts often occur with the people. If appropriate methods are used to help the wounded soldiers and the people cooperate, great results can be achieved.</p>
<p>Once, a team member told a rural woman to burn some boiling water for the wounded soldiers passing by, but the rural woman refused. So the team leader took out money to buy it from her and explained how the wounded soldiers were injured for the sake of the people and how the people should help them. So the rural woman was moved and willing to provide boiling water without asking for money, and also burned sweet potatoes to comfort the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>(5) How to run a nursery</p>
<p>Wherever the team members go, if there are many local women participating in labor, they will set up a nursery in the local area. It accepts children from one to six or seven years old. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e4">If the Chinese Sea is Blockaded? <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Ledi</p>
<p>These days, the Japanese side has been loudly declaring its intention to blockade the Chinese sea. Logically, this is a decisive measure that should be implemented as soon as the war starts. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, Chinese and foreign people were waiting for this move. However, almost two years into the war, they are only making loud noises. If it is regarded as a threat to Britain and the United States to help them seize concessions, or even to coordinate with Germany and Italy in Europe and alienate the rapprochement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, it is difficult to see any threatening power. It is just a frantic action after being attacked.</p>
<p>What does it really mean? We don't need to consult, but now someone has raised the question: If the Chinese sea is blockaded, what changes will occur in China's economy? What most people worry about is that after the blockade, China will not be able to buy military supplies from abroad; the daily necessities of the Chinese people will not be able to be imported; and China's native products will not be able to be exported.</p>
<p>These questions are indeed worth considering. But the answer is "obviously it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>First: Since the fall of the southwestern ports, the Chinese government's military supplies have been routed through certain international routes, and do not need to pass through the Chinese sea. Therefore, if Japan wants to cut off overseas military supplies, it should ask the Japanese navy to break through the Singapore military port; it should ask the Japanese army to attack Xinjiang. Otherwise, it is useless.</p>
<p>The second question should be answered in two parts: the occupied area and the rear area. In terms of lifestyle, it should also be answered by two groups of people: those who are thrifty and those who are extravagant. Indeed, many of the daily necessities in the rear were transported from the Chinese sea. However, even without the Chinese sea being cut off today, the Chongqing newspapers still cost more than eighty yuan each, and the market price in Shanghai is now about seven yuan and five jiao. The price of paper in Chongqing is so expensive, but the local publishing industry has not stopped, because they have all adopted local paper. The same is true for the shortage of cotton cloth in the mainland. It can be seen that even without the blockade, it is already the same as being blockaded. At present, the people of the mainland not only maintain their livelihoods, but also increase their income due to the development of handicrafts. Shanghai, a market for foreign goods, will of course face major problems after the blockade, but the most affected will be European merchants. Japanese merchants will not be willing to give up this opportunity, but when the Chinese people are as thrifty as the current mainland people and use local products, then Japanese merchants will have to suffer the consequences themselves.</p>
<p>These answers above also apply to the third question. In fact, it cannot打击 the Chinese government from obtaining export foreign exchange. The result is that it will smash Japan's existing method of obtaining export foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Japan's economic power completely depends on the world commodity market. It takes Chinese raw materials, processes them, and exports them. However, when Japan blockades China, its overseas profits will also be completely blockaded by others at the same time. Although it can occupy the Chinese market, or even have customers for Japanese goods in China, the Chinese purchasing power will inevitably decrease sharply with the decrease in exports. Moreover, its current exports are only for exchanging military supplies. Since China has no military supplies to supply, and Europe and the United States are now prohibiting military supplies from Japan, they will certainly proceed more thoroughly at that time. Some people say that Japan has been waging war against China for nearly two years, but it does not dare to formally declare war and does not dare to truly blockade the Chinese seaports. The main reason is here. That's right, this is the biggest reason, and it still exists now. Therefore, everyone believes that the Japanese side's roar this time is nothing more than a diplomatic intimidation tactic.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Deduction of "Huaxing Notes" from the Depreciation of the Japanese Yen <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zongtao</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War has been going on for nearly two years, and Japan has been forced to wage a long-term war. The most important strategy of a long-term war is to consume the enemy's economic power. Although the degree of consumption of economic power is manifested in general economic phenomena, its collective manifestation is probably in the changes in the value of the currencies of the two countries. Therefore, Japan is constantly trying to seize China's foreign exchange reserves in order to directly affect the credibility of the legal tender and indirectly affect the people's psychological resistance, and at the same time reduce China's ability to purchase military supplies from abroad. This is why "United Reserve Bank Notes" were issued in North China. However, the stability of the legal tender has thwarted the Japanese conspiracy, and they have suffered the consequences themselves. The repeated depreciation of the Japanese yen is enough to indicate the trend of the collapse of Japan's economic power, while also proving the optimism of China's anti-war future.</p>
<p>The depreciation of the Japanese yen did not start today: as far back as June and July of last year, the depreciation was not as severe as it is today. In early May, the Japanese yen on the black market was still above the legal tender, but it began to depreciate when the "Huaxing Commercial Bank" expanded and opened on May 16. As of today, 88 yuan of legal tender can buy 100 yuan of Japanese yen. Why is this? It can be discussed in terms of remote and recent causes:</p>
<p>Remote causes: (1) Currency inflation - Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's economy has gradually become difficult, relying entirely on the issuance of deficit bonds and the printing of banknotes to maintain the war against China. In the early years, Japanese financiers believed that the issuance of Japanese government bonds reaching 100 million yuan would be dangerous. However, today's extraordinary expenditures have caused the amount of government bonds to exceed 19 billion yuan. What's more, the most difficult thing is that most of the government bonds issued have not been absorbed by the people, but are stored in the Japanese bank, post office, and the vaults of large chaebols. Government bonds cannot be digested, and military needs are urgent; therefore, the government has no choice but to issue banknotes to clear the accounts. The issuance of banknotes exceeds the limit, which will inevitably cause currency inflation; that is, planting the seeds for the decline of the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>(2) Insufficient gold reserves - The Millard's Review weekly reported that, according to reliable reports, since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the gold reserves in the Bank of Japan's treasury have been transferred to the United States by 3.5 to 2 million yuan to pay for cotton, iron, oil and other war equipment. Therefore, today's Japanese yen banknotes are virtually without reserves. Apart from the annual production of 2.5 million yuan of gold, there is no other source. However, the issuance of banknotes is increasing sharply; it cannot maintain its credit.</p>
<p>(3) The circulation of military currency - Japan uses "military currency" for military pay in China. The purpose is nothing more than to save the lack of foreign exchange on the one hand and to disrupt the legal tender on the other. However, this kind of non-cash "military currency" is like waste paper when it flows into the hands of the people; those who hold this currency want to get rid of it as soon as possible and exchange it for legal tender. "Military currency" is not unrelated to the Japanese yen; the Japanese yen is greatly depreciated due to the depreciation of "military currency."</p>
<p>(4) The alliance between Japan and fascist countries - The Japanese yen was originally formally linked to the pound, which gained the trust of democratic countries, but since the outbreak of the war, Japan has colluded with Germany and Italy, which has made democratic countries very suspicious of the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Recent causes: (1) Depreciation of "United Reserve Bank Notes" - Recently, the "United Reserve Bank Notes" in North China have been depreciating, and the Japanese yen, which is related to it, has also depreciated. Moreover, speculators took advantage of the opportunity to exchange Japanese yen in North China for legal tender in Shanghai, resulting in a large amount of Japanese yen positions in Shanghai; which made the Japanese yen fall further.</p>
<p>(2) The stability of the legal tender - The foundation of the legal tender was extremely stable. After the establishment of the British loan and the increase of foreign exchange reserves, the external credibility of the legal tender has been enhanced. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign people in the occupied areas who were forced to accept the Japanese yen have exchanged it for the stable legal tender; the Japanese yen has fallen miserably.</p>
<p>(3) Restrictions on the export of goods to China - Japan, seeing the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Central China; feared that it would affect its domestic plans, so it suddenly restricted trade with Central China; thus, a large amount of Japanese yen left in Shanghai could not be absorbed for a while; at the same time, all the "military currency" in the inland areas could not buy Japanese goods, so they were all transported to Shanghai and exchanged for legal tender. Therefore, the supply of Japanese yen in Shanghai exceeded demand, and it was bound to depreciate.</p>
<p>(4) Japan's control over the export of pseudo "Manchukuo" and North and Central China - The soybeans, soybean oil, wheat, cotton and other goods that pseudo "Manchukuo" and North China transport to Shanghai every year, and the rice, silk and other goods that Central China transport to Shanghai are all extremely large in quantity; today, it monopolizes this kind of local products and restricts their transport to Shanghai, resulting in a surplus of Japanese yen chips in Shanghai, and the value naturally declines.</p>
<p>(5) The surge in immigrants - After our army moved west, the number of Japanese immigrants to Central China increased sharply, so the number of Japanese yen brought in must have been considerable. Flooding the Shanghai gold and stock market, it certainly greatly affects the value of the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>At the time when the Huaxing Commercial Bank was established amidst the depreciation of the Japanese yen, it can be seen that there is also a small mutual cause in between.</p>
<p>The establishment of "Huaxing Bank" was initiated by the Japanese; the plan was to issue "Huaxing Notes" to absorb legal tender and seize foreign exchange. Huaxing and "United Reserve Bank Notes" have the same style. However, the "United Reserve Bank" is a participant in the "Japanese Yen Group," so the "United Reserve Bank Notes" it issues are equal in value to the Japanese yen; the "Huaxing Bank" is prepared with legal tender and cuts off its relationship with the Japanese yen, thus reflecting the weakness of the Japanese yen. The black market therefore sold Japanese yen and rushed to buy legal tender.</p>
<p>As for "Huaxing Notes," its value must be even worse than the Japanese yen. Because the Japanese yen is still unwilling to guarantee, who will guarantee its credit? It is very clear. Given the failure of the "United Reserve Bank Notes" in North China, the future of "Huaxing Notes" is even more bleak, because the environment in North China is much better than that in Central China: (1) North China's foreign trade deficit is not as large as Central China's. (2) North China's market is not as complex as Central China's. (3) Japan's political and economic power in North China is more deeply rooted than in Central China. Even though the "United Reserve Bank Notes" are still depreciating, the "Huaxing Notes," which are in a more difficult situation, are naturally helpless, which is self-evident (reprinted from Shanghai Shen Bao).</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, This Newspaper, 7th] The enemy concentrated its main force in Western Shanxi and Southern Shanxi this time to invade westward, attempting to peek at the Yellow River and disturb the border of Shaanxi. However, after our army's separate counterattacks, as of the 7th, its offensive has been exhausted, and we have completely moved to the offensive. The invaders from Lishi and Zhongyang have suffered 2,000 casualties in the past week, and several mid-level officers have been killed. The invaders from the vicinity of Yuncheng, Jiexian, and Anyi have also suffered 1,000 casualties in the past three days. On the east bank of the Yellow River, we are excellently expanding our advance and engaging in bloody battles with the enemy. One of our units has advanced to the enemy's rear, posing a great threat to them. Our guerrillas along the Tongpu Railway have been active for days, constantly cutting off transportation. The area around Zhongtiao Mountain is also completely under our control.</p>
<p>The Shanxi Battle is Unprecedentedly Fierce; The Enemy at Zhangdian Flees South</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tanqu, 8th] Since the enemy launched a three-pronged offensive in Southern Shanxi on the 6th, the battle has been fierce and unprecedented. The enemy at Zhangdian who fled south occupied Ling Village and Qiaoxia Niu Village (south of Zhangdian), and then divided their troops to attack Shangjian Village (southeast of Ling Bridge), Dachen Village, and Shuntou Village (south of Ling Bridge), with a force of about 1,500. Another force of about 500 attacked Hanyao Village (west of Shangjian), attempting to directly attack Maojin. One of our units advanced to meet them, and another unit bypassed the enemy's flank and attacked them from both sides. The enemy was defeated and fled to Dachen Village. We took advantage of the situation to pursue them and recovered places such as Dong Dachen Gou in the morning of the 8th. Only the remnant enemy is still entrenched in West Dachen. The enemy increased their forces by 400 on the 8th, and we are thoroughly wiping them out. One of our units is actively pressing towards Xia Niu Village (south of Ling Bridge). The enemy is showing signs of retreating. The enemy at Shuntou Village was also repelled by one of our units on the 7th. Subsequently, the enemy reinforced and counterattacked. Our troops are fighting in the southwest area of Shuntou. After our brave counterattack and the successive recovery of places such as Shangjian, Hanyao Village, and Dachen, our morale has been greatly boosted. The enemy fleeing south will not be difficult to annihilate. As for the Jiexian front, the enemy with 3,000 troops also launched a two-pronged offensive on the 6th. One route with 1,200 to 1,300 troops harassed Huanggao Long Cen (southeast of Jiexian), and a small group of 500 to 600 harassed Longquan Village, reaching Xingju (northwest of Pinglu). Another route with 1,000 troops fled east from Monan Town to Daxia Gou Nan. The vanguard of 500 to 600 troops had already passed Che Village (southeast of Xiaojuan) on the 7th. At about 3:00 AM on the 8th, several hundred enemy troops attacked Pinglu from Dongping Tou (directly north of Pinglu), Xingdian (northwest of Pinglu), and Che Village in three routes. One of our units is intercepting and attacking them separately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 7th] According to military intelligence, after our army recovered Luoluo Town on the 3rd, it immediately took advantage of the victory to pursue the defeated enemy.

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] 'Financial News' commented on the issue of the devaluation of the national currency today, saying, 'The attempt to maintain the Chinese legal tender at eight pence or eight and a half pence has been abandoned. The Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee decided yesterday to let it rise and fall naturally so as to obtain a natural level and then maintain it again. This decision is intended to balance China's import and export trade and prevent the escape of large amounts of funds. It is reported that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has spent 5 million pounds. However, it is inaccurate to say that the source of funds is about to run out.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Our Foreign Exchange Administration previously announced the suspension of the sale of foreign exchange. The financial community here attaches great importance to it. This morning, a reporter specifically interviewed Zhong Daching, the chairman of the Gold and Silver Exchange, and asked about this matter. According to him, our Foreign Exchange Administration previously stopped selling foreign exchange. My brother also received a telegram this morning saying that the Huaxing Bank has issued a large number of military tickets in the past month, attempting to absorb our national dollars and transfer them to foreign exchange, intending to disrupt our country's finances. However, our Foreign Exchange Administration has already anticipated this and taken this measure to deal with it. This matter has no real impact on our country's finances. The price of national dollars fell slightly this morning because there were fewer buyers. This is a temporary matter, and it is expected to return to its original state in one or two days. Also, it was learned that the price of national dollars was slightly lower this afternoon than the previous day. The lowest price in the morning was 455, and then it rose to 467. The provincial milli-coupons were 370.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] The Japanese yen continued to fall today, with 100 yuan worth 91.1 yuan of national currency, which is even lower than the previous week's 94.5 yuan of national currency. Later, because our national currency fell slightly against the British pound, 100 Japanese yen rose to 94 yuan of national currency again.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] A spokesman for the Navy Department announced today that famous mail ships will not be subject to Japanese restrictions and inspections.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The National Government ordered on the 8th that Wang Zhaoming violated national policy and disregarded righteousness. At a time when the whole country was united in the War of Resistance, he deserted his post,妄主和議, and echoed the enemy's absurd arguments, hoping to incite people's hearts and obstruct the overall plan. After being punished by the central government, he still did not wake up, and went against the tide, secretly going to Shanghai last month, not hesitating to attach himself to the ranks of traitors, colluding with the enemy, and plotting wrongdoing. He is ashamed to collude with the enemy, and his actions to harm the country clearly violate the provisions of Article 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Recently, people at home and abroad have expressed their deep indignation and have submitted more than a thousand requests for arrest and severe punishment. If the government still shows tolerance, how can it uphold national law and comfort our soldiers and civilians? All military and political organs across the country should immediately arrest him and punish him according to law in order to maintain discipline. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Red Society on the Jinan Front (Part 1) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Shanxi War Zone, Jin Zairong</p>
<p>On the Jinan front, news of the "Red Society" (i.e., the Red Spear Society) is often heard. Such groups are truly mysterious in our eyes. I always wanted to visit them once to see what it was all about. Coincidentally, two "Red Society" liaisons from northern Pinglu came. They didn't have the airs of the Boxers but had the proper respectful attitude of farmers. I obtained their consent and decided to go back with them.</p>
<p>One morning with a light drizzle, I set off with the two "Red Society" liaisons. It was more than sixty li from where we lived to the "Red Society" village. The Jinan alluvial plain has the most ravines. After the rain, the mud roads were incredibly slippery. When we passed a five-hundred-foot-high ravine, we didn't walk down but rolled down. At the foot of Zhongtiao Mountain, where it was quite close to the front line, was the defense area of the Sichuan Army. Here, some of the mountain roads were damaged, which was even more annoying. We became snakes or reptiles. We didn't arrive at the "Red Society" village—××gou—until five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>××gou is a not-so-deep mountain valley with many cave dwellings. At the east and west ends of the valley, stalwart and robust farmers stood guard. They all held red-tasseled spears, calmly watching the front, because the ×'s (enemy) positions were only two li away. On the not-too-distant earthen hill, there were even the ×'s artillery positions, so the village was bombarded by cannons every day!</p>
<p>The "Red Society" meeting place was in a Temple of Heaven and Earth. After I entered the temple, many strong farmers and children had already gathered. They didn't ask "Where does the guest come from," but took away the two rifles we brought (the guns were brought to give to them). They cocked the guns outside, making clacking sounds, which shows how much they loved guns. We were received by the local village head. Because he didn't know our purpose, he showed considerable embarrassment. After we explained our intentions, he finally relaxed. Then, I met the "Red Society" leader. It is said that on both sides of the Zhongtiao Mountain Range in Jinan, from Yangcheng County to Yuncheng, there are more than 80,000 members of the "Red Society," divided into four branches: Qianmen, Yixintang (also known as Heidaomen, Kanmen), Baishentang, and Qianshunhui. Each branch has a general headquarters; under the general headquarters are branch headquarters. Now distributed in northern Pinglu is Qianshunhui. The general headquarters is in ×× village, which belongs to Xia County north of Zhongtiao Mountain. It has more than 700 members.</p>
<p>As for the "Red Society" in northern Pinglu, it is a spontaneous organization of farmers. Most of them live in villages in front of or to the side and rear of the ×'s (enemy). They are unwilling to flee their homeland and unwilling to be obedient subjects. After being trampled by the ×'s, they united to protect their homes. After these organizations were established, they fought against the ×'s. Therefore, the ×'s now dare not underestimate the local people. They dare not come to the countryside again without a large force. Now they are distributed in six places: Anjiagou, Suhancun, Shaobao, Fengkou, Gucheng, and Yaotou, with about 200 members, forming a large encirclement against the ×'s.</p>
<p>Some people rumored that the "Red Society" was being used by the ×'s. The source of the news is this: "Although Xia County and Anyi County north of Zhongtiao Mountain have fallen, the ×'s cannot completely rule them. The people established the Red Spear Society to protect their homes under such circumstances, but because they were not strong enough, they dared not fight against the ×'s. They only wanted the ×'s not to come and considered it done. The ×'s also carried out mass movement work, often interacting with them, and often summoning them to meetings, lending them livestock for farming, and engaging in public buying and selling. They wore the 'Red Society' armband and amulet belt (one of the society's sacred objects, a three-inch-wide blue cloth strip with a talisman hidden inside, worn diagonally across the body, which can protect the body) and could enter the city (ruled by the ×'s) without trouble. In order to strive for their existence, they had to perfunctorily deal with the ×'s. This is the origin of the news that the 'Red Society' is being used by the ×'s." As for the "Red Society" in the south of the mountain, it is completely different from the north of the mountain. It confronts the ×'s and often destroys the ×'s telecommunications.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Revealing the Secrets of the Pseudo-Huaxing Bank from its Organization, Business, and Motives <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Baorong</p>
<p>Regarding the role and impact of the pseudo-"Huaxing Bank," the author attempts to study the content and future of this monstrous creation from the bank's organizational structure and planned business policies.</p>
<p>According to the latest issue of the "International Economic News" published in Tokyo, the organization of the bank is as follows:</p>
<p>Name – "Huaxing Commercial Bank" (English name: HuaHaingCommerceialBank).</p>
<p>Location – "Head Office": No. 2, Route Sayle An, Shanghai; Nanjing Branch: Corner of Lingkang Road and Zhu Shen Road. The above head office and branch are said to have "opened" on May 15. There are plans to add "branches" in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places.</p>
<p>Capital – 50 million yuan (considering its attempt to make "Huaxing notes" equal in value to legal tender, the value of the capital of 50 million yuan seems to be equal to 50 million yuan of legal tender).</p>
<p>Investors – Pseudo "Reformed Government": 25 million yuan</p>
<p>Japanese side: 25 million yuan</p>
<p>(Including) Industrial Bank of Japan: 5 million yuan</p>
<p>Bank of Korea, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Sumitomo Bank: 4 million yuan each</p>
<p>Personnel – "President": Chen Jintao (pseudo "Minister of Finance of the Reformed Government")</p>
<p>"Vice President": Oiso Ichi (pseudo "Director of the Central Bank of Manchuria")</p>
<p>"Directors": Okazaki Kaheita (former head of research at the Bank of Japan), Ebara Takenosuke (former auditor of the Yokohama Specie Bank), Shen Ruchang (former director of the Continental Bank), Dai Xunlu (former manager of the Osaka branch of the Bank of China; it is said that Dai also serves as the manager of the pseudo-bank).</p>
<p>"Supervisors": Chen Riping (pseudo "Vice Minister of Finance of the Reformed Government")</p>
<p>Business – (1) Discounting, (2) Documentary Bills, (3) Buying and selling foreign exchange, (4) Buying and selling gold, silver, and foreign currency, (5) Deposits, (6) Arranging negotiable instruments, (7) Safe keeping, (8) Savings</p>
<p>Special Features – Issuing "Huaxing Bank Notes." At the time of opening, the "Reformed Government" will deposit 10 million yuan of interest-free deposits and manage "state treasury affairs of the Reformed Government."</p>
<p>Term – "Business term: 30 years."</p>
<p>From the organization of the bank, it can be seen that it has no future. It is clearly a plundering mechanism formed by the heads of the Nanjing pseudo-"Reformed Government" and the Japanese financial conglomerates and military authorities. It hangs the signboard of "Commercial Bank" to distinguish it from the "Joint Reserve Bank," which carries the name of "National Bank." Rather than wanting to establish "natural credit" (i.e., credit not created by force), it is more like a result of the distribution of spoils among the heads of the Northern faction. The fierce struggle for power and profit between the two pseudo-organizations in the North and South can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The motives for establishing the "Huaxing Bank" and issuing counterfeit banknotes differ between Japanese merchants, the Japanese military, and the pseudo-organizations. The Japanese merchants' motives lie in the shortage of raw materials and foreign exchange. They hope to fully obtain raw materials and foreign exchange resources from within the Chinese war zone. However, they want a financial institution that can control Chinese trade and a currency that can be freely used to achieve the above objectives.</p>
<p>The Japanese military's motives lie in the shortage of military supplies and strategic concerns. Because they have no foreign exchange, they cannot buy foreign weapons. Not having enough funds to pay the huge troops is their most painful shortage of military supplies. The activity of guerrillas causes the Japanese military the most headache. The front line is always strained, and the rear is restless. Strategically, they really feel helpless, so they want to destroy the financial foundation of our army from a monetary and financial perspective.</p>
<p>As for the motives of the beastly pseudo-organizations, in a nutshell, they plan to get rich fully. These people take on the roles of "new nobles" simply to make some money. If they cannot create money, it is difficult to satisfy their desires. If they cannot control their subordinates, it is even more difficult to buy a large number of cronies and henchmen.</p>
<p>Therefore, they agree in principle on issuing "Huaxing notes" and destroying legal tender, but they have their own ideas on how to do it. It is said that using legal tender as a reserve for "Huaxing notes" is the victory of the Japanese financial conglomerates and pseudo-organizations. They really hope that legal tender will collapse, but knowing that it is hopeless, they think that by relying on the light of legal tender, the counterfeit "Huaxing notes" will become valuable. Then, Japanese merchants can plunder raw materials in the war zone, reducing their need for foreign exchange for China. The pseudo-organizations can pay salaries, making it easier to tame cronies and henchmen. However, the opinion of the Japanese military department is absolutely contradictory. While hoping to rely on the light of legal tender to give "Huaxing notes" foreign exchange value and make it easy to pay salaries, they also hope that under the connection between "Huaxing notes" and legal tender, the credit of "Huaxing notes" will go bankrupt, and the credit of legal tender will also go bankrupt along with it. Since our Exchange Stabilization Committee announced the suspension of applications for foreign exchange and lowered the black market price of legal tender, this attempt has undoubtedly failed.</p>
<p>The main task of the bank seems to be issuing counterfeit banknotes, but the Bank of Japan, which has the nature of a Japanese national bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, which has the nature of an exchange bank, do not participate. This shows that they have already decided not to maintain the counterfeit banknotes. It also reflects the non-cooperation of Japan's bureaucratic financial capital and Japan's military financial capital (such as the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan) in this regard.</p>
<p>The failure of the "Joint Bank" and the "Joint Notes" has made them realize that bayonets cannot handle financial work, and force cannot establish monetary credit. But how easy is it to establish natural credit? Moreover, although the so-called capital of 50 million yuan is said to be "actually paid-in," who would actually believe it? Looking at the aforementioned so-called "privileges," it is listed that the "Reformed Government" will deposit 10 million yuan of interest-free deposits in the bank at the time of its opening and manage "state treasury affairs," which shows its internal emptiness. I dare to believe that most of this capital is offset by Japanese military scrip, because in fact they have no surplus funds.</p>
<p>Looking at the "Huaxing Bank's" main business, it is "controlling trade exchange," not handling ordinary commercial financial loans. But controlling imports will only worsen "international disputes." Controlling exports is technically difficult and will determine the failure of his entire conspiracy. Because his only possible method is: intercepting halfway and compulsory buying and selling, and it must be backed by bayonets. This fundamentally cannot establish natural credit for "Huaxing notes." The result will inevitably repeat the failure of "Joint Notes." Moreover, to make the interception successful, there must be a close-knit "smuggling" network. But in China's rural society and old peddling economy, this net will inevitably be full of holes. Moreover, it is a time of chaotic war, an era when guerrillas are active everywhere, and at most only a small number of exports can be intercepted. Moreover, most of the export foreign exchange that can be intercepted must be embezzled by the small fries and Japanese ruffians who are currently responsible for this kind of interception and fraud, or they will be bribed and released, or swallowed up entirely. Japanese financial groups and bureaucrats have long seen through this result, so the six major Japanese banks are only willing to contribute 25 million yuan of capital, which is a sign of eating rat poison with their eyes open.</p>
<p>To make "compulsory buying and selling" effective, the condition is that "Huaxing notes" must have value. But the promotion of "Huaxing notes" will inevitably rely solely on "compulsory buying and selling backed by bayonets." The "Huaxing notes" simply have no credit and cannot naturally generate their value at all, so they are still abolished.</p>
<p>To make legal tender collapse with the failure of "Huaxing notes" is a thought. Let alone the fact that legal tender itself has reserves, international credit, and natural credit woven from political and economic factors, just taking legal tender as the "reserve for Huaxing notes" will instead promote the credit of legal tender and make people love legal tender, and even refuse to use "Huaxing notes" because of this. Because legal tender has strength and credit, it will be forcibly pulled to guarantee it. Even a three-year-old child understands this principle. Moreover, legal tender is not guaranteeing it at all. Besides the Japanese and puppets, no one will believe that legal tender is the guarantor of "Huaxing notes." This conspiracy to "drag people into the water" will naturally have no hope of success.</p>

<h3 id="e17">If the Soviet Union is Drawn into the War, Britain and France Will Provide Assistance. Chamberlain Declared in the House of Commons that Mutual Assistance Negotiations are Proceeding Smoothly. <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 8th) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday that if the Soviet Union becomes involved in war with any European country due to the aggressive actions of another country, Britain and France will provide full military assistance. The provisions of the Anglo-French-Soviet pact are not limited to direct attacks on Soviet territory.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 8th) It is reported that the authorities have decided to send Sterling, the director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, who is currently on vacation in Poland, to Moscow to ensure the smooth progress of mutual assistance pact negotiations.</p>
<p>Britain Sends Central European Director as Special Envoy to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 7th) Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Sterling, the director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, will be appointed as the British special envoy to the Soviet Union. Sterling recently went to Bojing in a private capacity to visit the British Minister to Poland and has now returned home. It is reported that Sterling has participated in the entire process and evolution of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, so he is very suitable for the task of conveying instructions to Ambassador Seeds on behalf of the government and can be expected to enable the early conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement. It has recently been learned from diplomatic circles that a draft agreement that can satisfy the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, has generally been established. The general basis of this agreement includes the condition of mutually guaranteeing each other's "important benefits" if they are threatened with infringement. In the future, individual declarations can be used to express their "important rights and interests." If the Soviet Union declares that the territorial integrity and political independence of the Baltic countries are its important rights and interests, the problem of guaranteeing these countries can be avoided, and in practice, a guarantee can still be obtained. According to the general official psychology, now that the principle of absolute mutual assistance advocated by the Soviet Union has been agreed upon, it does not seem difficult to find a way to resolve all differences of opinion. Sterling is scheduled to depart from London by plane on Friday and arrive in Moscow around Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, it is generally speculated that there is full hope for the establishment of a thorough agreement next week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Report to the House of Commons on the Latest Situation of Anglo-Soviet Negotiations</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 7th) Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, saying: "Given the reasons that Parliament can appreciate, the government authorities cannot report on the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations every day. However, the current has reached another stage, which is enough for me to supplement the report of May 24. As a result of recent exchanges of views between Britain and the Soviet Union, the two countries have reached unanimous agreement on major issues. I believe that the British government has satisfied the Soviet Union's hope and is ready to conclude an agreement based on complete mutual relations. At the same time, it will clearly express its readiness to unite with France without reservation and provide full military assistance if the Soviet Union encounters aggression. The so-called full military assistance is not limited to the invasion of the territory of any of the three countries, but to be carried out in certain circumstances when any government of the three countries feels that its security has been indirectly threatened by the actions of other European countries. The above-mentioned certain circumstances have been reviewed at length. Regarding this point, I hope to obtain a method that can be accepted by the three countries, which can take into account the interests of other countries and obtain the cooperation of these countries to jointly resist aggression. At present, there are still one or two difficult problems to be resolved, especially the status of certain countries, which are unwilling to accept guarantees from other countries on the grounds of deliberately maintaining absolute neutrality. Since these countries are unwilling to accept guarantees from other countries, there is no way to force them to accept them. However, I hope to find some ways to prevent the above-mentioned difficulties and other unresolved issues from becoming an obstacle to the principle of mutual assistance and resistance to aggression. In order to promote Anglo-Soviet negotiations, it has been decided that the Foreign Office will send a representative to Moscow to explain to the local British ambassador the British government's views on all unresolved issues. I hope that this will enable the negotiations to be completed as soon as possible, so that the opinions of the three governments can converge and a "final agreement" can be established.</p>
<p>Regular Contact Between the Staff Departments of Britain, the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 7th) At a meeting of the House of Commons today, Chamberlain made a general statement on the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, and said that the governments of Finland, Latvia, and Estonia had recently notified the British government that they were willing to strictly maintain neutrality, so the guarantee being negotiated by the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union was unwilling to accept it. A member then asked the Prime Minister whether the British Staff Department had held talks with the Staff Departments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, or whether there were any plans to do so. The Prime Minister immediately replied, "The staff departments of the countries concerned maintain contact, which is a regular way of contacting the military authorities of the resident country through the military attachés of the embassies. In recent months, in order to develop this method, certain countries have been supplemented, and in the future, we should try to supplement them uniformly, but for the sake of national interests, it is not convenient to disclose the details."</p>
<p>Chamberlain Still Believes that the Agreement with Italy is Successful</p>
<p>Chamberlain made a lengthy discussion on the situation in Spain, saying, "All situations are under the government's consideration. The British government does not intend to submit any notes to the Italian government at this time. It will determine the next steps when the situation changes, there are substantial changes and new developments." Chamberlain replied to subsidiary questions, saying, "The Anglo-Italian agreement has not been broken. 20,000 Italian troops and 6,000 German troops are enough to show that most of the foreign troops have now withdrawn from Spain. The Italian Air Force stationed in Majorca has been reduced, and many pilots have also left. It is expected that the Italian Air Force personnel currently stationed in Spain will also return home soon. Only two German Air Force personnel remain at the Majorca air base, and the rest have returned home. The United Kingdom and Italy exchanged telegrams in the past to exchange views. The main purpose was to avoid Italy managing war materials in certain Spanish bases. According to current information, the Italian army in Spain has now withdrawn, and our main purpose has also been achieved."</p>
<p>French and Turkish Military Representatives are Active in Britain</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, 8th) General Aubby, the head of the French military delegation, and Holbury-Shaw, the British Minister of War, and General Gort, the Chief of the General Staff, held talks for a long time yesterday. At the same time, the negotiations between British military experts and the Turkish military delegation were also proceeding smoothly, but the results are unknown.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Paris, 8th) Yesterday afternoon, General Gamelin, the Chief of Staff of the French Army, accompanied by General Gort, the Chief of Staff of the British Army, inspected the British troops in Yaleso. It is reported that General Gort also explained the structure of the new British tanks to General Gamelin. According to reports, this type of tank is one of Britain's secret new weapons.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Niagara Falls, USA, 8th) The British King and Queen arrived at the US border at 2:40 this morning (standard time). Twenty minutes later, they set off for Washington.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Niagara Falls, 8th) US Secretary of State Hull welcomed the British King and Queen to the United States today, saying, "On behalf of the American people, I extend a warm welcome to Their Majesties. It is a great honor and pleasure. We are extremely happy that Their Majesties have come to the United States. We are willing to treat each other with a spirit of harmony and friendship, and we deeply hope that Their Majesties will have an extremely pleasant stay in the United States." The King smiled and thanked them. Mrs. Hull then took the stage and said, "I feel honored to welcome Their Majesties now." When the King's special train arrived at the station, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie was the first to jump off and wait in front of the King's carriage for the King to get off. Also disembarking were Lord Alton and Mr. Allieber, who were accompanying the King. They went to the King's location, but were stopped by the guards. Even after explaining, it was ineffective."</p>
<p>(Reuters, Niagara Falls, 7th) After holding the customary farewell ceremony in front of the Great Falls in Canada today, the British King and Queen drove to Table Rock, where they were led through the winding tunnels of the falls. When they arrived at the US border, US Secretary of State Hull introduced the welcoming personnel to the British King and Queen. Among them was a naval adjutant who would accompany the King and Queen at all times during their stay in the United States.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Niagara Falls, 7th) Canadians warmly welcomed the British King and Queen to the United States tonight beside the Great Falls in Canada, because crossing the falls is the US border. Americans there are already waiting to welcome the second British monarch and Queen to set foot on American soil. Nearly 500,000 people from Canada and the United States gathered here all day to watch this historically famous border crossing. US Secretary of State Hull came from Washington and will welcome the British King and Queen within the US border at the border. Hull told reporters that this kind of international visit is an example for some countries in the world that specialize in making trouble. There have never been two countries in the world that have as many similarities as the United Kingdom and the United States. The British King and Queen still had two and a half hours in the Canadian Falls Park before re-boarding the train at 1:30 AM (standard time) and crossing the international bridge to the US border. As soon as they crossed the international bridge to the US border, British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, will introduce US Secretary of State Hull to pay his respects. Hull, like all members of the welcoming committee, is wearing a lead-west suit. There are currently 10,000 schoolchildren gathered outside the hotel where the British King and Queen are dining, hoping that the British King and Queen will appear on the terrace to overlook the scenery of the falls. After the British King and Queen arrive at the US border and meet the welcomers, they will return to the train and go directly to Washington. US President Roosevelt will personally greet them at 3:00 PM tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Striving for the Final Victory in the Financial War <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The famous Austrian general Montecuccoli once said, "The first element of war is money, the second element is money, and the third element is also money." In the First European War, if Britain, France, and other countries had not received loans from the United States and the supply of military goods, they would have been defeated before the United States declared war. Today, any war is inextricably linked to finance. Therefore, while striving for ultimate victory on the battlefield, we must also strive for victory in the financial war to safeguard and accelerate the victory of the all-out war of resistance.</p>
<p>In the twenty-three months since the start of the war of resistance, under the wise leadership of our authorities, and with the loyal patriotic support of the national financial community and national capital for the central government's policies, and with the sympathetic support of international friends, we have consistently maintained a dominant position in the financial battles as well. Conversely, the Japanese financial community has encountered serious difficulties and crises. The reality of malignant inflation is not only destroying its national economic structure, but also increasing the difficulties of its military invasion of China. The recent disastrous defeat of the puppet currency policy in North China further proves that all Japanese attempts to solve its difficulties are dead ends. According to yesterday's telegraphic news, although our legal tender has been deliberately devalued to only 50% of the value of the Hong Kong dollar, it is still higher than the Japanese currency, which has been falling wildly and irretrievably, by 60 points!</p>
<p>The current Japanese financial strategy is mainly based on political offensives: supporting the puppet regime of Wang Jingwei and other traitors, strengthening the control of occupied areas, and attempting to use our national manpower and resources to solve their own difficulties and increase our difficulties. The activities of the China Development Bank, using the plummeting Japanese currency to exchange for legal tender, and then using legal tender to obtain foreign exchange, are the first step in implementing this strategy. This kind of financial offensive is likely to continue to develop frantically.</p>
<p>In order to deal a heavy blow in a timely manner, we have temporarily suppressed the price of legal tender this time. The power of the Stabilization Committee is used to carry out necessary control. In this way, first, it can break the Japanese and traitorous plan to absorb foreign exchange with Japanese currency to threaten the legal tender; second, it can stop the unlimited subsidization of over-importing from Shanghai, which can also be said to strengthen the effectiveness of foreign exchange control (it is said Shanghai has large over-imports in the recent two days, and absorbs 2 million pounds of foreign exchange every day). Third, from an overall perspective, it can adjust exchange rates and foreign exchange situations, prevent speculative merchants, and balance national import and export trade. Therefore, it can be seen that the various rumors after the devaluation of legal tender are obviously unfounded and have nothing to do with the unshakable credit of legal tender.</p>
<p>However, in order to win a greater victory in the financial war, we feel that there are several points to work on: First, since the central government implemented restrictions on the purchase of foreign exchange on March 12 last year, domestic and foreign trust has greatly increased, the credit of legal tender has been stable, and military and economic aspects have benefited. However, on the one hand, there are people who are ignorant of conscience who are doing their best to carry out their capital flight, which still needs to be stopped by law. On the other hand, regarding the restriction of foreign exchange, there should be more specific and clear regulations on what is allowed and what is rejected based on the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. That is to say, foreign exchange should be subject to further control, and trade with foreign countries should also be strengthened based on the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. Second, in the future, the Japanese are likely to devote themselves to looting the occupied areas and excluding the interests of European and American powers. Issuing paper money indiscriminately, taking our products, and exporting them overseas to exchange for munitions for further offensives is also an inevitable trend. Therefore, we must also intensify diplomatic efforts to promote the anti-Japanese movement to aid China, and expand guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, calling on compatriots in the occupied areas to refuse to use counterfeit money, and oppose and strike against the Wang Jingwei and traitorous puppet organizations. Third, we must negatively try to block the relationship between the foreign exchange ports of the Japanese puppet regime and the Shanghai foreign exchange market, and at the same time, actively try to move a large amount of Shanghai funds inland and promote local production and economic construction. All of this depends on the enhancement of the government's control, integrity and the prevalence of talented politicians, and on the trust of the entire Chinese nation in the government and the loyal support for the wartime financial and fiscal policies.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] Undersecretary Butler gave a written reply yesterday to the question raised by Sir Milner, a Conservative member of the House of Commons, stating that the British government does not consider it necessary for British merchant ships sailing from Shanghai to inland ports to hold special permits issued by the Japanese army. Ambassador Craigie to Japan has been instructed to make representations to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] Conservative Member of Parliament Suttermann asked in the House of Commons yesterday whether the government had acquiesced to the Japanese requirement that British citizens intending to travel to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River must hold passports issued by the Japanese military authorities. Undersecretary Butler replied that the government had acquiesced to the Japanese request to facilitate British citizens traveling to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, although the government did not recognize, in principle, Japan's right to restrict and control the actions of British citizens. Ambassador Craigie to Japan had been instructed to formally make reservations to the Japanese side. The situation on the Yangtze River had not yet returned to normal, so the government, on the one hand, made reservations in principle, and on the other hand, acquiesced to the Japanese regulations in order to obtain some convenience.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Undersecretary Butler said in the British House of Commons today, "The British government has temporarily followed the method of carrying Japanese military passes to allow its citizens to go up the Yangtze River, but the British government does not recognize, in principle, Japan's right to restrict the actions of British citizens. The government has instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to formally declare a reservation of this right." He also explained that the government temporarily complied because the situation on the Yangtze River had not yet returned to normal. "We believe it is better to declare a reservation of rights on the one hand, and temporarily comply with the method to gain convenience in going up the river." Chamberlain also replied in writing to a question from Conservative Member of Parliament Ward Low, stating that the government's policy on the situation in the Far East was reflected in the note sent by Japan to the Japanese government on January 14 of that year. "There is no time for a special debate on the matters raised by this issue. I am very sorry, but I also know the importance of this issue and will find an opportunity to debate diplomatic events." Regarding the "Sigrist case," Hua asked Chamberlain to give him a full opportunity when he held a debate on foreign policy on an appropriate day, so that Japan's conspiracy against the foreign concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Gulangyu, as well as Japan's detention of British merchant ships, blockade of the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, could be specially discussed. The Undersecretary replied to the "Sigrist incident" that the government wanted to make detailed demands and must first obtain a full report. It will still take some time before, and said that Prime Minister Chamberlain had stated on May 24 that the government reserved all rights to claim compensation. The Undersecretary said in a written reply to Ward Low's question, "The government does not recognize that British citizens traveling from Shanghai to the interior need to obtain permits from the Japanese military, and stated that the government has received reports." It is said that the Nanjing puppet Provisional Government had stated that after June 1, foreign ships wanting to unload goods at the Jiujiang shore must first obtain a permit from the Japanese military authorities. The government has instructed Ambassador Craigie to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government and ask the Japanese government to immediately instruct the relevant authorities not to insist on Japanese military permits, because the British government has not recognized this necessity. Mr. Butler then reported on the incident at Tongji Hospital in Hongkou on April 24. When British police officer Sampson was investigating the death of Dr. Li Li after being hit, he was suddenly beaten by a Japanese military officer. The British Consul General in Shanghai has protested to the Japanese Consul, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has also protested to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The government will do everything in its power to protect the lives of British citizens.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] At a meeting of the British House of Commons today, Colonial Secretary MacDonald reported on the British Malaya's contribution to the British Empire's defense expenditure, which was greatly cheered by the members of the House. He said that in the past thirty years, Malaya had contributed a total of more than 7.25 million pounds to the British Empire's defense construction. In addition to this amount, the Malayan government bore the cost of local defense forces, including the British garrison, amounting to 15 million pounds.</p>

<h3 id="e26">British Government Promulgates Regulations; Instructs Air Defense in British Territories; Detailed Regulations for the Construction of Air Raid Shelters; Hong Kong Will Also Proceed According to These Methods <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The clouds of war are gathering, and the invading countries are trying to take risks. For two years, the situation in Europe has been turbulent. In order to maintain world peace and prevent riots by ambitious countries, the British government is implementing military preparedness, strengthening national defense strength, and preparing for contingencies. The safety and defense of the British mainland and its colonies are actively preparing, and air defense work is the most important. Looking at the tension of Hong Kong's air defense work in recent years, it can be seen that in the future war, aerial warfare will inevitably become one of the most tragic. The British government cannot help but prepare for this.</p>
<p>Promulgates Regulations; Instructs Air Defense</p>
<p>The British government has repeatedly announced air defense plans for its domestic regions and colonies. Recently, it published a white paper detailing air defense regulations for factories, shops, and houses, instructing air defense methods for factories, shops, and houses in wartime to protect the safety of their employees or workers, and stipulating that all shops and factories employing more than 50 employees or workers, located close to dangerous areas, must comply with these methods. The book specifies the construction methods, raw materials, area, and location of indoor and outdoor air raid shelters, trenches, or tunnels. The regulations will be implemented in various parts of the United Kingdom and in British colonies and leased territories. Hong Kong will also carry out air defense work according to the methods instructed in the white paper.</p>
<p>Protecting Safety; Two Methods</p>
<p>It has been learned that one of the most important sections of the regulations is the equipment of air raid shelters in factories, houses, and shops. Although there are no provisions requiring air raid shelters to have defenses against poison gas, the regulations stipulate that they must have the above-mentioned preparations so that they can be dealt with at any time in an emergency. This point has slightly changed from the British government's initial poison gas defense plan. The regulations state that the location of the air raid shelter should be as close as possible to the position of the people taking shelter, so that whether during the day or at night, the evacuees can arrive within five minutes of hearing the alarm. There are approximately two methods for protecting the safety of shop employees. First, set up air raid shelters, trenches, or air raid tunnels on the ground or underground outside the building. Second, build indoor air raid shelters.</p>
<p>Regulations for the Construction of Air Raid Trenches and Shelters</p>
<p>Indoor air raid shelters can be divided into approximately four types: A. Building air raid trenches or tunnels underground in the factory; B. Using the factory's basement as an air raid shelter; C. Selecting suitable houses or corridors and strengthening their consolidation as much as possible to serve as air raid shelters; D. Specially opening up an air raid shelter in the factory building. For air raid shelters, part or all of which are underground, the area occupied by each person shall not be less than six square feet, and the height shall not be less than twenty-five square feet. In order to reduce the loss of direct bombing, each air raid shelter is limited to 50 people. If the area of the room is larger and can accommodate more than 50 people, then every 50 people must be separated by a solid wall, but the total cannot exceed 200 people. The distance between each air raid shelter should also not be less than 25 feet, and if possible, it should be 30 feet.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Protecting Factory Personnel</p>
<p>Also, in order to avoid the danger of the exit being blocked, each room should have two exits, the further apart the two exits are, the better. As for indoor air raid shelters, they should be located on the ground floor or basement of the building. If due to special circumstances, or in buildings without a basement, the second floor can be used as an air raid shelter. Personnel in the factory who are responsible for guarding machinery or other important work and have considerable air defense knowledge should be provided with proper air raid shelters. The location of outdoor air raid shelters must try to find the most suitable place, and air raid tunnels should be built near the building so that evacuees can enter them calmly in case of an emergency, so as not to cause unfortunate events due to chaotic order. In terms of area, it is stipulated that 1,200 people can be accommodated per acre. For important factories, their air raid shelters should be located near the factory to avoid wasting time for evacuation and hindering their work. In addition, attention should also be paid to the storage of various chemical raw materials and dangerous goods in the factory, and attention should be paid to moving them to avoid accidents, etc. The above is the more important content of the regulations, and there are also specifications for the raw materials used in the construction of air raid shelters, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Tiger Disease More Ferocious Than Tiger; Beware of Cholera; Do Not Import Uncooked Food; Immediate Injections are the Best Policy <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Epidemic diseases are prevalent in Hong Kong, especially cholera. More than fifty cases have occurred since the beginning of summer, and more than half of those infected have died. In addition to holding free immunization injections in various districts, notices have been posted on the main roads in recent days, detailing the dangers of cholera and advising residents to be cautious about their diet to prevent it. The original text of the notice is copied as follows: "Cholera in Hong Kong." Cholera is a very contagious disease. Its symptoms are severe diarrhea and vomiting, muscle cramps, followed by exhaustion, often leading to death. The source of the disease is actually caused by a microbe that contaminates the food and drink (especially the drinking water, milk, fruits, vegetables) that enters the body. This microbe can be eliminated by heat. Preventive measures are as follows: (1) Milk and drinking water must be boiled before drinking; (2) Fish, shellfish, vegetables, and opened fruits, as well as raw food, should not be eaten uncooked; (3) Ice cream, jelly, and soda, etc., should not be eaten unless you know their origin; (4) Try to prevent flies from landing on food; (5) Do not add raw ice to drinks; (6) If you suffer from diarrhea, no matter what, seek medical treatment immediately; (7) Human excrement and the clothes and bedding of patients are all media for transmission, so they must be soaked in disinfectant. Preventive injections can protect against cholera for five months. People from all walks of life can go to the hospitals or medical bureaus set up by the government to receive preventive injections without paying a penny. If you can afford it, please ask your doctor for injections.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Enthusiastic Registration of Health Personnel: Preparing to Apply for Service Back Home; Over 100 Registration Forms Issued in Three Days <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Holding weapons to defend the country is, of course, the duty of every citizen, but coping with modern warfare relies on national mobilization. Anyone with a skill must contribute to the country. This is not only true for those who bear arms. Among the most urgent and numerous needs are health and transportation. Regarding transportation personnel, active recruitment is already underway in the Nanyang Islands, Siam, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Macau, with enthusiastic responses from overseas Chinese. However, in the area of health, only overseas Chinese groups have spontaneously organized medical teams to return home for service. The scale of these organizations is far from meeting the needs of the battlefield.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of long-term resistance, the Guangdong Provincial Government has launched a registration program for wartime health personnel, printing forms and distributing them to various counties for completion. This is because many of these talents usually gathered in Guangzhou, but after the invasion of Guangzhou, many fled to Hong Kong and Macau, representing nearly half of the province's doctors. Therefore, registration is also being conducted simultaneously in Hong Kong and Macau. In Hong Kong, the registration is handled by the China Youth Relief Office, which began on the 5th of this month. Nurses, midwives, and others must register on time, or their licenses will be revoked.</p>
<p>According to Huang Rongyu Zhi, the director of the office, since the beginning of registration, overseas Chinese health personnel in Hong Kong have registered very enthusiastically. In just three days, over 100 registration forms have been issued. The office has only received 300 forms, and based on the current situation, it is feared that this will not be enough. A letter has been sent to the Provincial Health Department requesting additional forms to meet the need.</p>
<p>The purpose of this registration is to allow the authorities to easily recruit health personnel when needed. As for the recruitment process, the registration office may temporarily act as an agent in the future. The regulations and methods for recruitment have not yet been discussed. The registration of wartime health personnel still needs to be reviewed or examined by the responsible authorities, and those who pass will be given certificates, ready for recruitment at any time. It is not yet known whether this work will be handled by the Guangdong Health Department or the Military and Political Health Department.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been found that the current voluntary registration of Chinese residents in Hong Kong does not conflict with the talent registration of the Provincial Health Department. Even if each health worker participates in both registrations, there is no conflict. If our country recruits first, doctors originally from the mainland will naturally return home to serve. If our country recruits later, transportation will be cut off, making it impossible to apply. Moreover, most of the existing doctors in Hong Kong are British citizens and must participate in Hong Kong talent registration to meet the needs of emergencies. Therefore, the two can proceed without conflict.</p>

<p>Since the westward movement, the Guangdong China War Relief Team has expanded its operations and actively trained a large number of personnel to meet the needs of various war zones. Now that our army is about to launch a counter-offensive, the front line urgently needs relief personnel. Hua Zhenzhong, the garrison commander of Chaozhou and Shantou, recognizing this, telegraphed Wu Zemin, the chief of the team, to send a team to Shantou to serve with the army. After receiving the order, Wu decided to send the cadre training class, which had completed its training in Hong Kong, as the third team. It is reported that the team is scheduled to hold a departure flag-giving ceremony at the Tsz Chi Middle School on Nathan Road, Kowloon, at 3:00 PM on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Pan Siwei (40 years old), a teacher at the YMCA, took advantage of the holiday to lead 12 students on a trip to Butterfly Valley in Sham Shui Po. Upon reaching their destination, Pan and student Liang Qiguang walked ahead, about a few feet away from the other students. Suddenly, three thieves, armed with knives, rushed out from the hillside and blocked the path of Pan and Liang, brandishing their weapons and threatening them. Pan, seeing the ferocity of the thieves, dared not resist and allowed them to search him. As a result, a wallet containing $10.50, a gold ring, a dart, and a pen were stolen from Pan. Liang was robbed of $0.45. The three thieves then searched the 11 students following behind, stealing about $4. After succeeding, they calmly fled towards the hillside. In total, silver and goods worth $34 were stolen. Later, Pan and the others returned to the Sham Shui Po police station to report the incident.</p>

<p>The cargo boat No. T929H, fully loaded with 300 cans of kerosene, 100 bags of fertilizer, 20 packages of native cloth, and other miscellaneous goods, set sail from Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong, on the morning of the 17th of last month, bound for Haifeng County. There were six crew members on board, including Liu Pei (44 years old). It was about 4:00 PM that afternoon, when they sailed to the Chinese waters six nautical miles southwest of the Henglan Lighthouse, when four of the crew members, including Liu San (25 years old), conspired to tie up Liu Pei and Zhou Liuyi (29 years old), and threw them into the sea, stealing the boat and its cargo. Later, Liu was rescued by another boat, while Zhou was taken by the sea. Liu Zeng only returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday to report the incident to the Tsim Sha Tsui police station. It was found that the kerosene on board was worth $600, the fertilizer was worth $40, the cloth was worth $120, and other miscellaneous goods were worth $20, totaling $780. It was also found that the boat was recovered by the water police patrol boat.</p>

<p>Some Hong Kong residents are dissatisfied with the slow delivery of "First Class Airmail." According to the schedule of the Imperial Airways flights last week, the flights were originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at noon on Monday, but due to the delay of the Imperial Airways plane, the flights were delayed by 24 hours and only arrived in Hong Kong at 5:45 PM on Tuesday. What residents are dissatisfied with is that the Hong Kong post office stamped the letters at 6:30 PM, but the letters were not delivered to the addresses until 9:00 AM the next morning. When "First Class Airmail" was first implemented, the Hong Kong post office delivered the mail arriving at noon every day on the same evening, but now this method of delivery has been improved.</p>

<p>The Chinese Amateur Alumni Association has recently been actively and intensively carrying out its work. After sending off the second batch of alumni, including Zhang Chu, from eight schools to return home to join the army, the association recently responded to the campaign to collect underwear and trousers. As a result of the efforts of the alumni, HK$201.50 was raised and handed over to the Guangdong All-Circles Committee for Comforting Soldiers Bleeding in Battle through the Ta Kung Pao, which can be used to make about 300 sets of underwear. Recently, to strengthen relief work, the association held its second general alumni meeting at the Chinese Amateur School yesterday to discuss various activities. The meeting was enthusiastic, and the second session of the board of directors was re-elected on the spot. It is reported that the association will also hold a variety show in the near future to raise funds for the elementary school for refugee children.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Insufficient Capacity of Filtration Plants: Water Restrictions May Be Imposed Again This Summer; Water Affairs Officer Mr. Wood Speaks; Lenient Restriction Method Planned <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>As a result of the sharp increase in Hong Kong's population, water consumption has been huge, resulting in insufficient supply from the existing filtration plants. Water restrictions may be imposed again. Since the cancellation of water restrictions, water consumption has been extremely high, but the water storage in the various reservoirs in Hong Kong and the central area has not been lacking. There is indeed a lot of unfiltered water, but the filtration plants are not sufficient to meet the demand. Mr. Wood, the water affairs officer, said in a statement that the experience gained from announcing the all-day water supply in Hong Kong on May 23rd shows that it will not be possible to maintain an all-day water supply this summer, especially when there are several days of hot weather. Due to the rapid increase in population at the end of last year, the capacity of the existing filtration plants is difficult to accommodate the large amount of water required. At present, the expansion of the filtration plants has been approved, and the situation is expected to improve by the summer of 1940. If the Bureau deems it necessary, water restrictions will be re-implemented, using a lenient restriction method, that is, supplying water all day on one day and then supplying water for 15 hours the next day. Restrictions will be applied to both Hong Kong and Kowloon. For example, if Hong Kong has an all-day water supply today, Kowloon will only have a 15-hour supply, and if Kowloon has an all-day water supply today, Hong Kong will only have a 15-hour supply.</p>
<h3 id="e37">A Quick Sketch of the King's Birthday Parade <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Yesterday, just past seven in the morning, the usually quiet Happy Valley was already surrounded by thousands of people, packed like sardines. The noise was deafening, breaking the silence and turning it into a lively scene. The trams and buses to Happy Valley were still packed, carrying people to watch the King's Birthday parade in batches.</p>
<p>The racetrack was also filled with hundreds of foreign gentlemen and ladies, most of whom were eating an early tea in the bars behind the stands, leisurely waiting for the start of the parade. The crowd outside the hall did not have such enjoyment, but fortunately, the vendors speculated and brought out many pastries to sell to the audience to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>At seven-thirty, the army, navy, and air force teams participating in the parade arrived one after another. There were more than 2,500 people in total. The guest seats A specially set up for Chinese and Western officials and the consular corps were also full; the remaining seats for officers' families, scouts, students, reporters, etc. were also full.</p>
<p>At 7:45 AM, Major General Nash, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China, arrived with his chief of staff and aides. All the officers and soldiers under inspection stood at attention to pay their respects.</p>
<p>Major General Jia, dressed in military uniform, rode his horse back and forth, inspecting the team first.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM sharp, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, accompanied by his aide-de-camp Captain Bate Smith, arrived in a car, escorted by a volunteer motorcycle team. The commander ordered the team to stand at attention and salute. At the same time, the British national flag slowly rose and fluttered at the top of the flagpole in front of the podium.</p>
<p>The Governor, wearing a white gold-epauletted Commander-in-Chief dress uniform, with a badge hanging on his chest, a white plume on his hat, and a sword, was very majestic. The aide-de-camp was also wearing his dress uniform, with a red plume on his hat, looking very dignified. After he returned the salute to the team, he came out to inspect. Although it was raining heavily at this time, the inspection ceremony was held in the rain.</p>
<p>After the inspection, the Governor walked onto the podium. The newly appointed Hong Kong Naval Commander Pitt, Air Force Commander Brown, Naval Volunteer Commander Beatilis, and Army Volunteer Commander Ross and other senior officers were already waiting on the podium.</p>
<p>After the Governor stood still on the podium, the commander gave an order, and the team made a divisional formation, preparing to march past the podium. The Hong Kong Garrison Army band immediately went to the front of the podium and began playing a march.</p>
<p>In the soft sound of military music, Commander Major General Jia led the way, leading the Navy, Naval Volunteers, 8th Heavy Artillery Regiment, 5th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, Hong Kong and Singapore Artillery Hong Kong Regiment, Engineer Regiment, 2nd Battalion of the Scottish Royal Army, 1st Battalion of the Middlesex Army, 5th Battalion of the Lam Put Danny Indian Army, 1st Battalion of the Gao Wang Indian Army, mule team, Air Force, and Hong Kong Volunteer Force and other units, marching around the field.</p>
<p>When the team passed in front of the podium, the officers raised their swords, and the soldiers looked at the officers on the podium. The Governor and other officers on the podium raised their hands to return the salute.</p>
<p>After the parade, the team lined up as before. The Governor and all the officers left the podium and stood in front of the flagpole. After the bugler sounded the horn, the British national flag on the flagpole slowly lowered, and the King's flag was raised instead. The band played the British national anthem, and everyone stood at attention, indicating the King's arrival.</p>
<p>The King's flag is deep red, yellow, and blue. The upper left and lower right are both deep red, and each side is embroidered with a golden harp. The upper right is yellow, embroidered with a red lion and a red border. The lower left is blue, embroidered with a golden lion.</p>
<p>After the national anthem was played, all the officers and soldiers took off their hats and cheered three times, and then sounded the horn again, lowered the King's flag, and raised the British flag instead, indicating the King's departure. Everyone saluted again to see him off. Each time, the Governor represented the King in accepting the salute.</p>
<p>With the ceremony completed, the Governor left first, still escorted by the volunteer motorcycle team. The army, navy, and air force units and the audience also dispersed one after another. It was already 9:30 AM.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Serving Culture, Helping Youth: This Newspaper Launches Student One Dollar Newspaper Reading Campaign; Deep Sympathy from Various Schools, Who Cooperate One After Another <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>For a promising young student, the newspaper—a progressive newspaper—is their spiritual food. If spiritual food is interrupted, they feel empty and lost. If spiritual food is not sufficient, they immediately feel dissatisfied. This is a common experience for many friends—especially young students with a strong desire for knowledge. This explains the value of newspapers, which is the first point.</p>
<p>School textbooks are the source of knowledge for students. A student loyal to learning cannot be disloyal to textbooks. However, the world's knowledge is vast and complex. Cultural progress is also changing rapidly. To think that textbooks are the whole picture of learning is like a frog in a well. So, what is the best supplementary material? What is the most realistic and vivid textbook? Undoubtedly, the newspaper is one of the most important. A student loyal to learning cannot be disloyal to newspapers. This explains the value of newspapers, which is the second point.</p>
<p>Individual survival depends on the entire society. A healthy citizen cannot be ignorant of the dynamics of the country. China is a link in the world, and understanding the international situation is a basic requirement for being a modern person. Therefore, understanding current events and studying current events is one of the life tasks of young students. In Hong Kong, newspapers are an even more important tool for raising the national consciousness of young students. Especially during the great and sacred war of resistance and nation-building movement. This explains the value of newspapers, which is the third point.</p>
<p>The above is only the broad outline. In fact, the benefits of newspapers are far more than this.</p>
<p>A wise teacher makes guiding students to read newspapers one of the important educational methods; guiding students to cut out and paste newspaper clippings becomes a major extracurricular activity. There are indeed many wise teachers in Hong Kong who can understand this. However, the problem then arises:</p>
<p>1. Newspapers are too expensive, and many students cannot afford them;</p>
<p>2. How to cut out and paste newspaper clippings in a rational way?</p>
<p>These are the difficulties that various schools feel in guiding students to read newspapers. This newspaper is honored to be loved by the advanced members of the Hong Kong education community, and we are very encouraged to receive many valuable opinions from them.</p>
<p>This newspaper believes that education is the lifeblood of the country, and newspapers are a sharp tool for promoting education. At this critical moment for the survival of the country and the nation, the education community and the press must strengthen cooperation even more. Therefore, we have launched the "Student One Dollar Newspaper Reading Campaign." The content of this campaign has been seen in this newspaper's "Letter to the Hong Kong Education Community" on Teachers' Day. The general idea is:</p>
<p>1. To introduce as much as possible beneficial to young students in the "moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic" education, and also rich in emotion and interesting opinions and writings; and encourage students to publish their works or opinions—therefore (A) in addition to the original commentaries, special articles, domestic and foreign news, "Free Talk" sports, entertainment, film and drama, etc., we plan to open a "Student Net," specially to welcome student contributions, and pay for contributions, (B) with each school as a unit, with the consent of the school authorities, to hold student current affairs essay competitions, common sense quizzes, and current affairs speech contests, debates, symposiums, etc., so as to make the gains from reading newspapers completely transformed into living knowledge and realistic learning.</p>
<p>2. To guide young students on how to read newspapers, and promote their habit of reading newspapers, we plan to select several important official documents published in our newspaper every morning, encourage students who read newspapers to cut and paste them one by one, classify them according to the nature of each text, so that they can be immediately analyzed and classified after cutting and pasting. All the paper for pasting newspapers, category cards, and classification tables will be pre-made and distributed by our newspaper for students to use. Students can divide and bind the clipped newspapers into volumes every few days, becoming the most intimate and realistic reference materials, on the one hand increasing their ability to understand current affairs, and on the other hand training their general management and office methods. The topics for the current affairs essay competition, current affairs quiz, and current affairs speech debate competition mentioned above are taken from the reference materials obtained from cutting out newspapers, and those who have outstanding achievements will be specially rewarded.</p>
<p>3. To reduce the price of newspapers so that every student can read newspapers without feeling the burden on their parents—therefore, we plan to reduce the price of newspapers as much as possible to one Hong Kong dollar every three months, reading two large sheets of newspapers every day, which is only one Hong Kong cent, which can be said to be an unprecedented record in the Hong Kong press! As for the paper for pasting newspapers, category cards, and classification tables, our newspaper will also handle it on behalf of the students. The paper will be printed with the student's name and the name of the school they belong to, and only a very low price will be charged.</p>
<p>Students who subscribe to newspapers should ask their schools to certify their subscription and fill in their address. Before school starts every morning, our newspaper will send staff to send the day's newspapers along with the important text classification table to each school, and ask each school to distribute them to each student according to their grade. However, on Sundays and public holidays, our newspaper will send them directly to the address of the commuting students.</p>
<p>Some people say: This campaign not only loses money for this newspaper, but also causes us trouble. However, we believe that we have a major obligation to our young student readers, so we are determined to do it.</p>
<p>In recent days, schools that have enthusiastically cooperated with us in promoting this campaign include Zhi Yong Middle School, Overseas Chinese Middle School, South China Middle School, Guangda Affiliated Middle School, Pangguang Middle School, Amateur School, Hainan Vocational School, Zhenguang Middle School, and Ling Ying Middle School. We sincerely request that other schools also quickly join hands with us. And we hope that students' parents will give their full sympathy. We have other detailed methods, and we welcome the education community and young student readers to ask for them. The address is 2 Pottinger Street, Central, the business department of this newspaper, telephone number: 28750.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shanghai's Opening as a Port <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Bai</p>
<p>Shanghai's geographical advantages drew early attention from foreign merchants. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, members of the British East India Company suggested to their superiors that Shanghai held promise as a commercial port. During the Jiaqing reign, due to strict prohibitions on opium, British merchants trading in Guangdong grew impatient and sought to open other ports besides Guangdong. In the twelfth year of Daoguang (1832), envoys were sent to Shanghai to investigate and request trade, but were refused by Daotai Wu Qitai, and left without success. Three years later, Lin Zexu burned opium in Guangdong, and the British then initiated war with China. In June of the twentieth year of Daoguang (1840), British forces captured Dinghai; in April of the twenty-second year (1842), they occupied Zhaopu; on May 8th, they seized Wusong, and on the 11th, they seized Shanghai. On the 15th, British forces left Shanghai, sailed up the Yangtze River, and attacked Zhenjiang and Nanjing. On July 4th, the British attacked Nanjing. Unable to withstand modern weaponry, China declared negotiations for peace. On July 24th, Imperial Commissioner Ilibu and Qiying signed a peace treaty of thirteen articles, known as the Treaty of Nanjing, with British Plenipotentiary Sir Henry Pottinger. Article Two of the treaty stipulated the opening of five ports:</p>
<p>"(1) Henceforth, His Majesty the Emperor graciously permits British subjects, along with their families, to reside and trade in the five coastal ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, without hindrance. The British monarch may appoint consuls to reside in these five cities, managing commercial affairs and corresponding with local officials. British subjects shall clearly pay duties and taxes according to the regulations outlined below."</p>
<p>Article Six of the Supplementary Treaty of Commerce signed in the twenty-third year of Daoguang (1843) stated:</p>
<p>"In the five ports of Guangdong, etc., British merchants, whether residing permanently or traveling occasionally, must not venture into the countryside to wander freely, nor may they enter the interior to trade. Chinese local officials should, in consultation with the British consuls, determine boundaries based on local customs and terrain, which must not be crossed, to ensure lasting peace between the parties. Sailors and crew members may only come ashore after the consul and local officials have established binding rules. Should any British subject violate these rules and venture far into the interior, regardless of their rank, local civilians may apprehend them and hand them over to the British consul for punishment, but these civilians must not assault or injure them, to preserve good relations."</p>
<p>Article Seven further stated:</p>
<p>"The perpetual treaty stipulates that British subjects may bring their families to reside in the five ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, without molestation or coercion. However, Chinese local officials must, in consultation with the British consul, determine which locations, what types of houses, or land may be leased by British subjects based on local customs. The price must be based on the current market rates in the five ports, ensuring fairness. Chinese citizens must not extort, and British merchants must not forcefully lease. The British consul shall annually notify the local officials of the number of houses built or leased by British subjects, who will then report to the authorities for record. However, the increase or decrease in housing depends on the number of merchants and the prosperity or decline of trade, making it difficult to set a fixed number."</p>
<p>The above clauses all pertain to Shanghai and constitute the fundamental treaty for the opening of Shanghai as a port. On September 17th of the twenty-third year of Daoguang (1843), the first British Consul, George Balfour, accompanied by his translator Walter Henry Medhurst, arrived in Shanghai from Zhoushan. A week later, he declared Shanghai officially open as a port.</p>
<p>With Britain having opened the door to China, France and the United States followed suit. In September of the twenty-fourth year of Daoguang (1844), France and China signed the Treaty of Whampoa, comprising thirty-six articles. In May of the same year, the United States signed the Treaty of Wanghia with China. Both treaties were agreements for the opening of the five ports to trade.</p>
<p>After Shanghai's opening, foreigners gradually arrived to reside and establish settlements, which became known as concessions. The first was the British concession, which had regulations known as the Land Regulations or Property Regulations, commonly called the Yangjingbang Regulations. The first set of British Land Regulations, consisting of twenty-three articles, was promulgated by Shanghai Daotai Gong Muji in the twenty-fifth year of Daoguang (1845), later increased by one article to a total of twenty-four. These regulations stipulated boundaries, procedures for leasing land, and matters to be observed by foreign residents. Subsequently, foreigners repeatedly revised these regulations on their own, forming the basis of today's municipal laws of the International Settlement, unrecognizable from their original form. The original Chinese text of the first set of Land Regulations is no longer available. The English text was published in the North China Herald on January 17, 1852, and a translation is published in the first issue of the Shanghai Municipal History Museum Journal, which scholars can consult for research.</p>
<p>Before the second year of Tongzhi (1863), there was no so-called International Settlement in Shanghai, as the British and American settlements were independent. The establishment of the American Settlement occurred in the twenty-eighth year of Daoguang (1848), initiated by "Wen Jianshi," namely Rev. William Jones Boone of Wen Jianshi Road. Later, due to security issues in the American Settlement, Americans proposed merging the American Settlement with the British Settlement, thus the International Settlement was established. Initially, the British Settlement covered only 138 mu. By the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu (1899), the area of the International Settlement had expanded to 5,583 acres, equivalent to over 33,000 Chinese mu. However, the 47,000 mu of roads built beyond the boundaries were not included. The above figure represents the current area.</p>
<p>The origin of the French Concession in Shanghai dates back to the twenty-seventh year of Daoguang (1847). The first consul was M. de Montigny. The road in front of the Great World (Dashijie) running south from the north, known as Rue Montigny, commemorates this consul. The land initially leased by the French was very small, only two mu, three fen, eight li, and five hao. In the spring of the twenty-ninth year of Daoguang (1849), the French Concession was formally established, covering an area of approximately 56 hectares, with the following boundaries: south to the city moat, north to the Yangjingbang Creek, west to Guandi Temple and Chu Family Bridge, and east to the Chaozhou Guildhall, along the river to the eastern corner of the Yangjingbang Creek. The agreement for the French Concession also stipulated that "if the area is insufficient in the future, other land will be discussed separately." The French Concession expanded once in the eleventh year of Xianfeng (1861), increasing its area by approximately three hectares. It expanded again in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900), increasing its area by another 1,112 mu, totaling 144 hectares. In the third year of the Republic (1914), it expanded a third time, reaching an area of 1,002 hectares, twenty times larger than its initial size.</p>
<p>The administration of the International Settlement was managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局). The organizational structure of the SMC consisted of a meeting of foreign taxpayers, which elected a board of directors. The board then established various committees for different departments. Under the military affairs committee was a director-general, who oversaw the general office. The general office's subordinate departments included the Volunteer Corps, the Police Department, the Fire Department, the Health Department, the Works Department, the Education Department, the Finance Department, and the Intelligence Department.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council currently has fourteen directors: five Chinese, five British, two American, and two Japanese. There is a chairman and vice-chairman. The inclusion of Chinese directors was achieved after a struggle and was realized in the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930). The Board of Directors decides on important administrative matters of the Municipal Council and has the power to appoint or dismiss officials within the bureau. Meetings are held every two or three weeks, and important documents are distributed to the directors for their opinions.</p>
<p>The administrative body of the French Concession was the Conseil d'Administration Municipale (公董局). Initially, the directors were appointed by the French Consul, but were later elected according to the organizational laws of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale of the fifth and seventh years of Tongzhi. In January of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), a new organizational law was promulgated, replacing the board of directors with a temporary committee. The committee included five Chinese directors and three Chinese committee members. The participation of five Chinese directors was decided after the victory of the National Revolution in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), following amendments to the regulations of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale was divided into five departments: (1) the General Administration Department; (2) the Municipal Administration Department, which was further divided into: (i) the Political Affairs Secretariat, (ii) the Finance and Legal Affairs Office, (iii) the Land Office, (iv) the Classified Business Office, (v) the Salt Affairs Office, (vi) the Health and Relief Office, (vii) the Slaughterhouse, and (viii) the Education Office; (3) the Technical Administration Department, which included: (i) the General Technical Research Office, (ii) the Radio Station, Signal Station, and Observatory, (iii) the Fire Brigade, (iv) the Planting and Cultivation Office, and (v) the Public Works Office; (4) the Legal Advisory Department; and (5) the Police Department.</p>
<p>There were three types of courts in the Shanghai concessions: (1) Consular Courts, (2) Mixed Courts, and (3) Special District Courts. Consular Courts were established based on consular jurisdiction. Mixed Courts were organized by consuls from several countries and were established based on the Land Regulations of the eighth year of Tongzhi. The power of the Special District Courts, formerly known as the Mixed Court (会审公堂), was controlled by foreigners. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the Jiangsu Provincial Government negotiated its return and established a Temporary Court. In the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), representatives of the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representatives of five countries—Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil—signed an agreement in Nanjing regarding the Chinese Court in the Shanghai International Settlement. The French representative subsequently signed the agreement as well. The Temporary Court in the Shanghai International Settlement was abolished, and the Jiangsu Shanghai Special District District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court were established on April 1st. On July 28th of the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), the Chinese government and France signed a Sino-French Agreement regarding the Chinese Court within the French Concession, consisting of four articles and seven appendices. Following this agreement, the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District District Court and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court were established in the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Shanghai's Museums <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Events and objects recorded in books, no matter how numerous, become mere empty words on paper without real objects to prove them. Hence, the institution of museums exists to supplement the deficiencies of books. The creation of Shanghai's museums can be attributed to Father Heude, a French Catholic priest, who founded the Xujiahui Museum in the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867). The second was the Shanghai Museum, founded by the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (1874). The Shanghai Municipal Government recognized the importance of museums in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933) and proposed building a museum in the city center. It officially opened in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937), and Shanghai finally had a municipal museum for Chinese people. The history of Shanghai's three major museums is described below.</p>
<p>(1) Heude Museum (Aurora Museum)</p>
<p>Father Heude was a biologist who arrived in Shanghai in December of the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867). Seeing that the Xujiahui Catholic Church already had a small collection of biological specimens, he decided to expand it and establish a museum. Soon after arriving in Shanghai, Father Heude began to investigate the interior of China, paying particular attention to the Yangtze River basin. Each return brought a large number of unique specimens. He went to the northwest regions to collect Père David's deer, and his achievements were enormous. His book "On the Deer" has become one of the world's most famous works in biology. In the ninth year of Guangxu (1883), he built a museum south of the Xujiahui Jesuit Generalate to store specimens. It was open to the public every afternoon, free of charge. At that time, the downstairs stored animals, fish, bird skeletons, and the upstairs stored beetles, shells, crustaceans, and taxidermied animals, birds, and snakes. Father Heude presided over this museum for thirty years. Afterwards, it was directed by Father Pierre Marie Le Bourgeois, then by Father Licent Émile, and now by Father Teilhard de Chardin. However, Father Licent Émile is still in the museum as a researcher.</p>
<p>Over time, the collection of specimens grew. The old building was not enough, so in the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), a large-scale museum was built within the Aurora University campus. The museum has three floors, each about 80 meters long, divided into three display halls, as well as research rooms, laboratories, libraries, photography rooms, etc. To the south of the museum is a botanical garden for cultivating flowers and trees for research. It opened in the winter of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), with visiting hours set from 2:00 to 5:00 PM on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Admission was two jiao. Currently, the first and second exhibition halls are open to the public. The first exhibition hall displays Chinese antiques collected by Brother Gilles of the Tushan Orphanage. The antiques are divided into metals, jade, pottery, and embroidery. At the north end of the hall is the remains of Huang Quan, a juren from Chongming Xie Jia Town during the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, who died in the sixteenth year of Kangxi. In the sixth year of the Republic (1917), his descendants exhumed his grave. The body was not decayed, and his clothes were as new, as was his wife, Madam Lin. The coffin was obtained by Brother Gilles, who sculpted an image of Huang Quan in wood, dressed it in the original burial clothes, and placed it in the coffin along with other items. One of the exhibited embroideries is a type of Gu embroidery, a famous Shanghai product, known as hollow embroidery. The second exhibition hall features biology, such as mammals like rhinoceroses, bears, boars, deer, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, mollusks, and insects. The bird specimens are beautifully arranged and lifelike. The insect specimens are also very elaborate, as the museum is currently focusing on entomology. There is a separate plant room with 50,000 specimens. Furthermore, the various books published by the museum are very substantial and highly admired by experts around the world.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Museum</p>
<p>The Shanghai Museum is located on the fourth and fifth floors of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at No. 20 Museum Road in the International Settlement. The museum was founded in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (1874) and has been in existence for over sixty years. The honorary curators have mostly been naturalists and biologists, and the current honorary curator, Sha Weipeiyu (沙韋佩尤), is a giant in the field. Therefore, the museum's exhibits are mostly biological specimens, although there are also many works of art and antiquities. The objects come from China, as the museum focuses on the study of China. The first honorary curator of the museum was Park Lai-a (朴來阿). On the seventh day of the tenth month of the first year of Guangxu (1875), Shen Bao (申報) published a news report about the museum:</p>
<p>"It is a long-standing practice in major cities in the West for residents to build a museum to display birds, animals, and various objects for the enjoyment of those interested in natural history. In prefectural cities, they display items from the state and county; in capital cities, they display items from around the world, calling it a museum. Western merchants residing in Shanghai are now imitating the Western practice and establishing a museum in this port, gathering objects from China and the East. Although the project is just beginning, there are already many items on display. Among the insects are wild boars from the shores of Lake Tai; among the birds are eagles, magpies, sparrows, etc. There are also various objects from the waters, too numerous to mention. Others, such as mantises, grasshoppers, and butterflies, are also divided by species, each labeled with its name. Each object is marked with its origin and the name of the person who donated it. Chinese and foreigners are welcome to visit without charge. The West has a wonderful method for preserving feathers of all kinds, so that even when the skin is dry, the feathers do not fall out. This method has now been obtained by the Chinese, and glass eyes have been purchased from abroad, so that no matter what exotic beasts or rare birds are decorated, they seem to come alive. Everything in the museum is provided by Westerners interested in natural history. The person in charge of this matter is Mr. Park Lai-a of Yuanfangxiang Firm."</p>
<p>Museum Road was originally named Yuanmingyuan Road. The municipal authorities of the settlement, valuing the museum, renamed it. From the second year of Guangxu (1876), the Municipal Council began to donate funds to support the museum annually.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Municipal Museum</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Museum was proposed in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933). The funding came from public bonds, with 300,000 yuan allocated for the museum's construction. The exterior of the building was similar to that of the library and located opposite the library. The two buildings faced each other, forming the left and right wings of the municipal government. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), the museum's preparatory committee appointed a temporary board of directors. The chairman was Mr. Ye Gongchuo. Mr. Ye was a lover of art and skilled in managing affairs, so he was well-suited to lead the museum. The board of directors decided that the museum's focus would be on art and history, with a particular emphasis on Shanghai's history.</p>
<p>The museum's construction was completed on Double Tenth Day in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935). The internal layout was roughly as follows: (1) Ground floor: The central entrance is a lobby, approximately 17.5 meters wide and 14 meters long, with stairs to the upper floors and cloakrooms and sales rooms attached. From here, one enters the great hall, approximately 11.5 meters wide and 18 meters long. The hall displays the Four Great Square Stele of Lu Shen, a worthy son of Shanghai, and twelve Gu embroidery tapestries, a specialty of Shanghai, are hung on the walls. Two clocks are placed, which can indicate the Shanghai time and the corresponding time in various countries around the world. Inside the great hall is a first exhibition room. The corridors on both sides of the hall display various documents related to Shanghai. The left and right wings of the front part of the corridor are offices. The protruding part on the left is the library, and the protruding part on the right is a lecture hall. (2) Second floor: The central part is divided into two sections; the front is the art section, with a large puppet stage, and the rear is the history section, displaying clothing, utensils, music, embroidery, and models of hairstyles from different eras, which are particularly eye-catching. The corridors also display historical objects. The wings with the best lighting display calligraphy, paintings, porcelain, and pottery, which are the focal points of the art section. (3) Central second floor: Above the front display hall is a mezzanine floor, level with the flat roof of the rear half. From here, open-air stairs lead to the gate tower on the fourth floor. The gate tower also has a platform for panoramic views. There is a basement under the great hall for boilers. In April of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic (1936), the museum opened with a Chinese architecture exhibition, attracting a large number of visitors who expressed great admiration. In January of the twenty-sixth year (1937), the museum was officially opened to the public, with thousands of Chinese and foreign visitors coming to see it every day. The city center was bustling with traffic. July 7th was Shanghai's memorial day, and various exhibitions were held by the municipal government's affiliated organizations to celebrate. The museum held an exhibition of Shanghai documents, which was praised by all for its excellent and systematic presentation. Unexpectedly, on that day, the Japanese invaders created the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, launching their war of aggression against China. Soon after, the August 13th Incident occurred in Shanghai. Although some of the museum's exhibits were evacuated in advance, large items such as stone steles and various models, such as the models of Shanghai's three major industries (fishing, cotton, and salt) displayed in the rear hall on the ground floor, were left in the museum due to the difficulty of moving them, and are now likely reduced to ashes.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Our North Jiangsu Guerrillas Forbid Japanese Ships from Transporting Pigs <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Residents May Have No Pork to Eat</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported on the 31st that in two or three days, Shanghai may have no pork for sale. Currently, the pork supply is only enough to last for about two days. If the North Jiangsu guerrillas rigorously enforce their order prohibiting Japanese ships from transporting piglets, then farmers in that area will no longer be able to transport their piglets to Shanghai. Currently, ships transporting pigs to Shanghai must be designated by the "Shanghai Livestock Market" in Hongkou. Since this market is an organization under Japanese protection, the designated ships are all Japanese. The North Jiangsu guerrillas, upon learning of this monopoly, prohibited farmers from using boats to transport pigs to Japanese ships. In severe cases, they not only confiscated the pigs but also burned the boats. Pig dealers on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek refused to register with the new market, causing pigs from the interior to be detained by the market authorities. Over the past two weeks, the supply of pork to Shanghai has decreased due to this non-cooperation movement. Now, the guerrillas are prohibiting livestock farmers from transporting pigs to Shanghai, dealing a fatal blow to this industry. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is said that the new market is now controlling the transportation of other livestock, which is part of Japan's economic invasion of Asia. However, the authorities have not yet made any announcement on this matter.</p>

<p>Assistant Police Chief to be Appointed by Japanese</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-owned Continental News reported on the 31st, the Shanghai Municipal Police is expected to announce the establishment of a new police district on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek in mid-June, headed by a newly appointed Japanese assistant police chief. The district will be named "E" District and will include the extra-settlement roads where many Japanese reside. Hongkou and Yangshupu, currently included in "C" and "D" Districts respectively, will be separated. The assistant police chief will be a Japanese police officer currently serving in a department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The Japanese side has been demanding the establishment of a new police district including areas where many Japanese reside, with patrolmen under the command of a Japanese assistant police chief. The action of the Shanghai Municipal Police suggests that the long standing negotiations have yielded a "satisfactory" outcome.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese Commissioner of Customs announced that from June 1st, ships sailing to Funing, Qidong, Haimen, Xinghua, Quanzhou, Hanjiang, Xinyang Port, and Haimen in Zhejiang must first obtain permission from the Japanese naval authorities before being allowed to clear customs and set sail, shipping companies sailing to Xinghua, Quanzhou, and the Beisha lines believe that the Japanese have no right to interfere with foreign ships. Therefore, before the Japanese obstruction becomes a reality, they are determined to continue to dispatch ships as usual. The foreign ships cleared for Beisha from the Jianghai Customs on the 31st were Wantung, belonging to a British firm, and Parade, belonging to an Italian firm. The foreign ships cleared for Beisha from the Jianghai Customs on the 1st were Yihe, belonging to a British firm, and Deyao, belonging to a Portuguese firm.</p>

<p>On May 30th, the Shanghai Municipal Police (工部局警務處) heard that a gambling den would be established at No. 864 Yu Yuan Road. On Sunday evening, they placed obstacles at the gate of the residence and at Lane 839. All those entering were questioned, and a final notice was delivered to the owner of the residence (said to be Chinese), demanding a guarantee that the residence would not be used as a gambling den. However, no response was received within the time specified by the police. Chinese and foreign personnel from the police department have been stationed at the two entrances of the residence all day. As of the 31st, the situation has not changed. This is the second time in recent weeks that a private residence has been surrounded by obstacles. The first time occurred several weeks ago when a residence on Haig Road was also sealed off for being converted into a gambling den.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Impossible to Confirm</p>
<p>According to the Japanese side yesterday, recently, cadres of the First Brigade of the Zhongyang Salvation Army (忠養救國軍第一大隊) entered the settlement to engage in anti-Japanese activities. Their base was located at ×× Bridge. The Japanese side, due to the special nature of the settlement, was unable to arrest them directly. Therefore, they used methods of enticement and, after a day, achieved their goal. The members of the group were lured to ×口 to buy weapons on May 28th. When they crossed the Sichuan Road Bridge to ×口, they were quickly arrested by members of the Japanese Kempeitai. Eight people were arrested. The Japanese side also claimed that they had repeatedly fought with the Japanese army around Shanghai. They were ordered by the Chongqing government to infiltrate the settlement and contact various parties in an attempt to carry out terrorism. However, according to inquiries made by reporters to foreign sources, the above news could not be confirmed.</p>

<p>The English-language Greater American Soldier’s Paper reported that Jewish immigrants have opened many shops in the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, displaying goods which are quite attractive. There are already 9,000 refugees from Germany and Austria. Their numbers may exceed 20,000 this year. These people are not merely weeping and lamenting their fate. Instead, they will expand their activities. Japan's plans will be disrupted. The influx of Jewish immigrants to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek has become a serious problem for the Japanese community. The rights and interests of Chinese and foreigners in Hongkou have already been mostly eliminated. The area is still under strict Japanese control. Foreigners outside of Shanghai have suffered great losses due to the Japanese army's tyrannical actions. Now, the rights and interests of the Japanese in Shanghai are also threatened.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Shanghai's Native Banks <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's native banking industry occupies an extremely important position in China's financial world. It has a long history. Native banks existed before the opening of Shanghai as a treaty port. Originally, Shanghai, a hundred years ago, was an important hub for north-south shipping. The northward transport of rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the southward transport of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast all used Shanghai as a central point of convergence. With countless sails filling the harbor, trade was frequent. The collection and disbursement of debts and the operation of capital naturally required a third party to provide services, and thus the organization of native banks came into being. Subsequently, it closely followed Shanghai's progress and gradually developed. Today, it has evolved with the times and shares the financial center stage with the banking industry.</p>
<p>Shanghai's native banks are divided into "exchange settlement (huihua)," "clearing house (tiaoda)," and "coin exchange (qiandui)." "Exchange settlement" native banks are members of the Shanghai Native Bankers' Association. "Clearing house" native banks are not qualified to join the association, although their business is very similar to that of "exchange settlement" banks. "Clearing house" native banks are further divided into four types: Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen, based on the difference in their capital standing. As for "coin exchange" native banks, they are the smallest organization in the native banking industry with the least capital and the smallest scope, and are fundamentally different from "exchange settlement" and "clearing house" banks.</p>
<p>The focus of Shanghai's native banking industry rests on the "exchange settlement" banks, so when discussing the native banking industry, one should talk about "exchange settlement" banks.</p>
<p>In the early days, a capital of 20,000 or 30,000 taels of silver was considered a large scale for an "exchange settlement" bank. But that is not the case now. 100,000, 200,000 is not uncommon, and there are several with 500,000 or 1,000,000. Their organizations are all partnerships. Before starting business, they must first join the association. When joining the association, they must submit the total amount of capital, the names of the shareholders, and the shares held to the association. After examination by the representatives of all members and a vote, it can be approved. The restrictions are very strict. It is difficult to pass unless the shareholders have a solid financial background and the "Ah Da" manager has an outstanding reputation. The amount of tangible capital of the native bank itself is a secondary issue that is not worth paying attention to. However, in recent years, in order to further consolidate the foundation of each native bank, its capital amount has increased several times compared to the past.</p>
<p>In the past, the location of native banks in the Nanshi (southern city) area was mostly in Limahu (inside the moat) area, and in the Beishi (northern city) area, it was mostly in Houmalu (back road) area (Ningbo Road), because of the convenience of their business targets and the interaction between the banks. However, in recent times, they have mostly gathered in the Beishi area, and there are fewer and fewer in the Nanshi area. The reason is that most of the commercial activities are in the Beishi area.</p>
<p>The task of native banks is, of course, to prosper the market and support commerce, so they have a deep relationship with merchants in various industries. Extending credit and loans was the main business of native banks in the early days. Now, because of the experience of failure in specializing in credit and loans, the current business of native banks is no longer limited to the old model. In other words: in the past, native banks focused on the commercial sector. All loans were based on the investigation and experience of the manager ("Ah Da" manager) and the runners. The quality of the clients, the quality of credit, and the gains and losses of operations could all be judged based on personal relationships and emotions, turning bad into good, and turning loss into gain. Everyone feels that this kind of business approach is not feasible in modern society and is dangerous. Therefore, they have also changed their approach and have begun to serve society, such as accepting current deposits, setting up insurance businesses, running trust businesses, and operating warehousing businesses, which also have a considerable history.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Native Bankers' Association is the evolved form of the past Native Bankers' Guild. The purpose of its organization is to enhance social welfare and safeguard the interests of the industry. However, in the early days, like other guild organizations, it was only used as a gathering place for industry sacrifices in spring and autumn. Later, due to the encouragement of the times, it successfully became an organization for seeking the interests of the industry and a place for exchange settlement and short-term lending. During the "January 28th Incident," in order to cope with the turbulent situation at that time, they established a Native Banking Reserve under the Native Bankers' Association. In addition to keeping the assets gathered by the industry, the Native Banking Reserve also served as a clearing house and facilitated short-term lending for the industry. The organization of the Native Banking Reserve not only saved the native banking industry from danger at that time, but also stabilized the hearts of the people in the entire financial market at that time. It has indelible achievements and valuable records in the history of the native banking industry.</p>
<p>After the "August 13th Incident," the colleagues of the Shanghai native banking industry also provided a lot of labor for the anti-Japanese war effort. However, because most people in the native banking industry are quiet and do not like to move around, their direct performance was very limited. As a result, they were forgotten, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>The war brought by the fascist juggernaut has destroyed everything in old China, and Shanghai's native banking industry is certainly no exception and cannot escape this huge aggression. Therefore, they are now facing a difficult and arduous fate. At the same time, the foundation of Shanghai's native banking industry in the past was built on the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but now the wealthy areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have turned into ruins, and they have deeply felt that their own reliance has been lost. The future destiny is quite terrifying, so they are prepared to learn from this bloody lesson, and plan to develop inland areas in order to seek their own revitalization and the rebirth of their business.</p>

<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The summer is scorching, the land is like fire, and people in Hong Kong naturally have many places to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>In the North Point swimming pool, couples often float and sink on the water surface, enjoying themselves. I say that this scene only envies mandarin ducks playing in the water, and does not envy the gods in the Guanghan Palace.</p>
<p>But during the national crisis, without the necessary spirit of shared hatred against the enemy, we live in this "Shangri-La," and we cannot ignore the rise and fall of the country.</p>
<p>The soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, what a magnificent sight. We are far away from the flames of war, living in a peaceful land. Try closing your eyes and thinking about the soldiers' loyalty, courage, and their tragic sacrifices, how can we not be moved?</p>
<p>Therefore, in this difficult and struggling period, our enjoyment should not forget the need to save the country. If we can transform useful money into the work of saving the country, it will be meaningful.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the basketball players in Hong Kong have often initiated charity matches to raise funds for disaster relief. This kind of work is very valuable.</p>
<p>The Basketball Association has always been willing to put in effort for good deeds. Since accepting a silver cup donated by this newspaper as a prize for holding a women's charity match, it has immediately actively prepared and received help from all sides. The competition will begin on schedule tomorrow night in the YMCA gymnasium to plead for the refugees.</p>
<p>Although there are only four teams participating in this charity match, namely Zhi Xing, China, Southwest, and Hua Xiong, there are many good players in each team, and their strengths are strong. Zhi Xing and China are especially valued by the general public.</p>
<p>The order of the competition has been re-edited due to the postponement of the event a few days ago. It will be held over three nights, two games each night, using a single round-robin system.</p>
<p>The battles on the first night (i.e. tomorrow night) will start with Southwest vs. Zhi Xing at 7:00 p.m., followed by China vs. Hua Xiong at 8:00 p.m. At that time, the good show will begin. The female soldiers, one by one, with fragrant powder and lotus arms, jade-like faces, will dance gracefully, swirling like flying. Their skills must be extraordinary.</p>
<p>In general, people expect that in the first game, Zhi Xing will be brave enough to defeat Southwest, and in the second game, China will be fierce enough that Hua Xiong will not be their opponent. But in any case, there will be fierce competition.</p>
<p>Tickets for the first two nights are divided into two types: 50 cents and 20 cents. Such a good show at such a cheap price. I urge the general public not to miss it.</p>
<p>The third night is the final, and the ticket price will be slightly higher, one dollar for the lower level and fifty cents for the upper level.</p>
<p>Basketball players contribute their strength, and spectators contribute their money, to jointly support the good cause. What could be better? The scene will definitely be very lively at that time, and the full schedule is recorded as follows (from the Basketball Field Marshal):</p>
<p>June 10th</p>
<p>7:00 p.m. Southwest vs. Zhi Xing</p>
<p>8:00 p.m. China vs. Hua Xiong</p>
<p>June 12th</p>

<p>— Ding Lao</p>
<p>——Precious Report of Sports History——</p>
<p>Sparta</p>
<p>The native Spartan population consisted of only nine thousand people, while the next lower class of commoners numbered one hundred and twenty thousand, and the lowest class of slaves reached as many as two hundred and twenty thousand. In order for such a small number of people to control the majority, it was especially necessary to promote martial education. During the period of 776-760 BC, a great man named Lycurgus emerged from the Spartan Dorians. He established a constitution for Sparta called Khcru. The sole purpose of the constitution was to promote national defense, to make the people brave and good at fighting, to have a spirit of regarding death as returning home, and to be invincible. Among them, the method of selecting and rejecting children is indeed able to evoke strange feelings.</p>
<p>(1) Identification of Children: The constitution has provisions for the selection and rejection of children. When citizens give birth to children, they must first report them to the national testing ground. In the field, older and more impartial citizens are appointed as inspectors to conduct strict examinations of the infants. If the inspectors believe that the body is strong and can be a pillar of the country in the future, they will order their parents to raise them. If they believe that the infants are weak and cannot be trained, they will be discarded in the Apostns cave in Mount Laygetosi. When the citizens of Athens gave birth to children, they also had to be examined by inspectors. However, if the body was found to be weak, they had to consult with the parents and obtain their consent before discarding them, unlike Sparta, which absolutely had to abide by the laws of the country.</p>
<p>Ancient Five-Sport Games Carved on Ancient Utensils</p>
<p>(2) Child Rearing: Children allowed to be raised by the state are raised by their parents at home before the age of six, focusing on physical training. At the age of seven, they must leave home and enter a common educational institution, where they are trained by teachers with slave status, Padapog, to develop habits of obedience to rules. Among a group of children, each group is divided into subgroups, with the bravest and most courageous as the leader. Many children in the group must absolutely obey him. At this time, education is entirely about cultivating discipline, valuing cooperation, gentleness, obedience, and other virtues. After the age of fifteen, these groups of children are transferred to other educational institutions. The method of education is the same as before. Young people over the age of eighteen receive special military training in addition to gymnastics until the age of thirty before they can marry, but they cannot freely enter and leave educational institutions.</p>
<p>(3) Curriculum: In Sparta's curriculum, whether it is reading, arithmetic, all departments are not as important as gymnastics. Even music is only singing religious and patriotic folk songs, or reminiscing about the deeds of ancient heroes, all of which are to inspire the spirit of the people. That kind of sweet-sounding music is absolutely prohibited. In addition to gymnastics, other sports such as running, long jump, high jump, wrestling, discus throwing, and javelin throwing are also highly valued, especially running, which is the most common. Running is divided into armed and unarmed. As for using weapons to scout enemy intelligence, it is a necessary subject in the curriculum. In short, the purpose of all curricula is to forge a strong and tenacious body, cultivate a strict sense of self-esteem, and be able to endure the hardships of war. It can be called a military training-centered education method, which is a kind of voluntarism education, not an education that focuses on knowledge. Therefore, everything must be concise and clear. Music that makes people happy and obscene and moving words are discarded like relics. Later generations called the texts they wrote the Lacnoia style, which is a dry and uninteresting style. The most surprising thing is the test method for examining the tolerance of pain of young students. During the festival day, the teacher can arbitrarily flog the students on the altar. If he says a word of pain when he is beaten, everyone will think that he is a useless fellow. If he is beaten until blood is all over the ground, does not cry out in pain, and does not change his expression, he can win the praise of the crowd. Even the parents who are being beaten feel very honored and will never feel pity. Even if he is beaten to death because of this, the teacher will not commit a crime.</p>
<p>(4) Clothing and Food: Spartans have short hair and bare feet, and never decorate themselves. They often wear no clothes when doing gymnastics. Even the clothes they wear on weekdays, regardless of winter or summer, are only allowed to wear one piece of upper and lower clothing. They are not allowed to apply oil when bathing, and they do not choose a place to sleep, but take the very rough spike of the reed by the river as a quilt. As for food, it is restricted to the point that one cannot be full. If one cannot bear the hunger, one may steal. If the means are clumsy and one is discovered, one will be severely punished. I will give two stories to show the Spartans' unbearable attitude towards food.</p>
<p>(1) One day, the king ate with the young people. The food was so bad that it was impossible to swallow. When someone sighed that the food was tasteless, the king said, "If you want the food to be tasty, you must add two things." What are the two things? Fatigue and hunger. (2) Plutasch recorded the story of a young man stealing a fox. His belly was broken by the fox, and even his genitals flowed out. He never made a sound and died.</p>
<p>(5) Women's Education: According to Spartan law, women do not have the qualifications of a household head, but are the property of the country. They are given military education in the same way as men, but they are very free and respected by the people, regardless of high or low, rich or poor, because they can produce strong citizens who are solely responsible for the country. They only marry after the age of twenty. Although the boundary between men and women is not very strict, the character of women who are not allowed to go out in Athens is more pure. They pay more attention to national affairs than their own lives. Their farewell speeches when they send their husbands or sons to war have become a very common saying: "Return with your shield, or return on your shield." This catchphrase at the time has become a timeless maxim. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[New York Electric] American tennis star Budge has been awarded the "Golden Crown" of the World's Fair as the best athlete in the United States for 1938. At the official presentation ceremony in the Sports Hall of the Fair, Major Rickinbach, Chairman of the Fair's Sports Advisory Committee, personally placed the Golden Crown on Budge's head.</p>
<p>Sports reporters and writers across the United States and responsible personnel in the sports world all recognize Budge as the most appropriate recipient of the award. Budge won four major tennis championships last year, namely the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the French Open, and the Australian Open.</p>
<p>In addition to Budge, the second-place winner was baseball pitcher Mill, the third-place winner was soccer star O'Brien, the fourth-place winner was track and field star Cunningham, the fifth-place winner was world lightweight boxing champion Armstrong, the sixth-place winners were world heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis and golf star Snead.</p>
<h3 id="e57">After Reading "The Proposal for Improving Physical Education" <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>This National Education Conference has outlined seventeen principles for the improvement of physical education, encompassing the establishment of physical education administration, the allocation of physical education funding, the improvement of school physical education, the promotion of social physical education, the training of physical education teachers, and so on. There are clear stipulations for all of these. It is foreseeable that the physical education program formulated under these seventeen principles will surely transform the past practices of independent action, emphasis on relaxation, and the focus on athletic prowess, into a coherent, mass-oriented, and universal physical education system. This will enable all people to benefit from physical education, thereby strengthening the foundation for resistance and national reconstruction. However, in my opinion, there are several matters that were not explicitly stipulated in the principles but must be considered when drafting the program. I am writing them down to consult with the enlightened pioneers in the field of physical education.</p>
<p>I. Improving School Physical Education Requires Specifying a Central Curriculum Progress — The proposal states regarding school physical education: elementary schools should aim to develop lively and natural instincts and establish the foundation for sound citizenship; secondary schools should aim to cultivate practical skills and complete the task of self-defense and national defense; and universities should aim to maintain interest in sports and adhere to good habits. These are clearly stated goals that those engaged in physical education should regard as golden rules. In the future, the implementation of physical education must target these goals and adopt appropriate materials and methods without a doubt.</p>
<p>School physical education in our country has been promoted for decades, yet no effective results have been achieved. Although there are many reasons for this, teachers acting independently and seeking convenience account for the majority. In the past, physical education materials were mostly based on the teachers' preferences. Teachers who were skilled in soccer taught soccer, and those who were skilled in basketball taught basketball. This extended to everything. The distribution of teaching materials did not consider difficulty or progression. Regardless of the level of the school or the grade, everything was the same. As a result, students believe that the simplest thing in the world is physical education, which gives rise to a sense of contempt and creates a culture of negligence. The effects are, therefore, impossible to mention.</p>
<p>Any science has a certain progression. When the teaching materials are constantly updated, students naturally do not find it boring. When the teaching materials are both easy and difficult, students naturally do not become negligent. To eliminate the past drawbacks of physical education, the highest national physical education administrative organ must select materials suitable for the current environment as a central curriculum. Analyze its movements, and according to the level of each school grade, compile a systematic progress outline to be circulated to schools nationwide for implementation. Schools nationwide should then consider the situation and, according to the outline, compile detailed curriculum progress items for each grade and teach them accordingly. In addition to the central curriculum, all other teaching materials should be used as supplementary teaching materials. At a minimum, students must learn the movements of the central curriculum according to the progress. If their abilities are sufficient and the central curriculum is easy to learn, they can use supplementary teaching materials as much as possible.</p>
<p>The meaning of specifying a central curriculum is, first, because there are too many types of sports. Without a central curriculum, students cannot learn everything due to insufficient abilities. Second, because there is a progress, the movements must be concrete. In many sports, only the results can be used to distinguish between high and low, and the difficulty of the movements cannot be differentiated. If only the items are changed in pursuit of progress, the true meaning of progress is lost. The sports with concrete movements are none other than national martial arts and lively apparatus exercises—parallel bars, horizontal bars, pommel horses, vaulting horses, mat exercises, etc.—two categories. Their movements are not only clearly differentiated in difficulty and can be used to specify concrete progress, but they can also cultivate practical skills, a habit of risk-taking, and a courageous spirit, adapting to the environment of resistance.</p>
<p>Today, only a few students in our country can automatically pay attention to physical training. To enable them to individually obtain the practical benefits of physical training, supervision is essential. If the school has this...</p>

<h3 id="e58">Hollywood Hosts—Amusements During Dinner Parties <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>When a host entertains guests, the most boring thing is probably when the guests start to look uninterested halfway through the meal.</p>
<p>Under such helpless circumstances, the host has no choice but to take out antique movie magazines. These books are still printed with the years 1914-1918. In these books, you can still see Gloria Swanson in the arms of her husband Wallace Beery, and Mary Pickford tightly holding onto an escaped convict. This result can only make the guests laugh and cry.</p>
<p>When Joan Crawford hosts a dinner party, she often shows a film of her own miniature garden theater after the meal. After showing the film, she plays a piece of nostalgic music, and then lets the guests chat and play as they please.</p>
<p>Recently, men have generally wanted to inquire about their girlfriends' work in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert has an all-electric kitchen in her acting studio. The equipment used for heating milk and washing dishes is all driven by electricity. Once, Claudette invited guests to a Sunday brunch. She taught them how to cook and peeled garlic for them to see.</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour is also a woman who likes to take her guests to visit the kitchen. She is especially happy to show them how to make toffee, fudge, and corn candy.</p>
<p>When Stuart Erwin hosts a party, he always likes to take out a phonograph and records from twenty years ago and play them for his guests one by one.</p>
<p>Otto Kruger likes to play a few popular modern songs on the piano to entertain his guests. Joan Fontaine always asks her guests to choose ten ancient queens when they are at home and let them freely comment and compare each queen. George Burns and Gracie Allen simply spend a lot of money to create a great performance program in front of their friends.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Soviet Children's Films <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The progress of Soviet films in form and content has been recognized by the world. Recently, the Soviet Union has also put in twelve points of effort to focus on "children's films" and has already had good performances. According to the new five-year plan for women and children, children's films accounted for 25% of the productions in 1938.</p>
<p>Soviet children's films are not only completely shown to children, but also completely acted by children.</p>
<p>However, in the Soviet Hollywood, just like the star system for adult films, there are no children in children's films. There is no need for a Shirley Temple to attract audiences. Soviet child actors must leave the life of an actor after completing their first film and cannot continue to act in a second film, because the Soviet authorities do not want individual children to enjoy great fame and be in the limelight.</p>
<p>Although Soviet child actors cannot continue to act in a second film, and their time on the screen is very short, the conditions for being a child actor are very strict, not casual. The great director Eisenstein once tested three thousand rural children for an actor before selecting one.</p>
<p>The so-called children's film is a general term. Children's films also vary in form and content according to the age of the children. For example, films for the youngest children are often story-based and accompanied by special music. Films for children aged eight to twelve are often about new inventions such as radio-controlled ships. Films for children over the age of twelve all have scripts. Not only must the production of children's films meet the needs of children of different ages, but the construction of children's cinemas must also meet their conditions. Moscow now has eight cinemas dedicated to children, and the height of the seats varies with age.</p>
<p>The most revolutionary thing in Soviet children's films is that no child actor knows where the camera is. In other words, they don't know they are acting when they are acting. Such a performance truly expresses the psychology and personality of an innocent child without reservation. Of course, it is very different from Shirley Temple's affectation.</p>

<h3 id="e60">"The True Story of Ah Q" Brought to the Stage <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun's famous work, "The True Story of Ah Q," describes the Chinese national character very thoroughly. In the past, many theater groups tried to rehearse it, but all failed due to the excessive number of actors and the difficulty of finding the protagonist.</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai theater community is jointly holding a charity performance with more than a dozen theater schools. Hosted by the Gonghua Theater Troupe, a total of six famous plays are being staged. "Ah Q" has the largest scope, so it is jointly rehearsed by the Gonghua, Jingwu, Yiyou, and Baolian theater troupes. After the performance, all proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to refugees. The venue will be either the Lyceum Theatre or the Xuan Palace Ballroom. The performance period is set for around June 15th. Although it had previously failed due to problems that were difficult to solve, they are willing to dedicate their spirit and material resources to speak up for the refugees in order to take care of the refugees' lives. This spirit is commendable. Moreover, the performers in this performance—including the staff—number about one hundred people, among whom there are many excellent ones. Therefore, the performance results can be predicted to be wonderful.</p>

<p>Average Daily Cost of £166, One of the Distinguished Guests on the Normandie</p>
<p>The liner "Normandie" set sail from New York. This was an unexpectedly luxurious voyage, as there were 743 passengers on board, all wealthy merchants. Most of them were millionaires. The total cost of the trip for all passengers was £200,000. Sonja Henie, the ice-skating star, was also one of the passengers. When the ship arrived at Nassau in the Bahamas in the British West Indies, she and her entourage disembarked there. The price of the cabin she booked cost £1,500.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie's party consisted of six people, including her mother, brother, and two attendants. The travel expenses for those followers alone also cost £1,800. As for Sonja Henie's personal bill of £3,300, it did not include the cost of external expenses.</p>
<p>The "Normandie" is preparing to sail to South America and the West Indies. This voyage of £200,000 will last only 24 days.</p>
<p>The amount of champagne and various precious wines consumed on board is unknown. Many delicacies and exquisite meals are cooked by highly reputable chefs on board, because the distinguished guests embarking on this trip are figures rarely seen on passenger lists.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie's diet is rich, and her behavior is luxurious, worthy of being a model wealthy woman. She is currently 26 years old and earns £1,000 a week. Her personal performances cost £80,000 on her tour in America.</p>
<p>During this trip, she spends £500 on stockings alone. The silk tights she wears while skating cost seven dollars a pair, but she has to change them five times a day.</p>
<p>On average, Sonja Henie spends £166 a day on this luxurious trip, but given her daily income, this amount of expenditure is not considered an overdraft.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Business with No Capital <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>When people think of a business with no capital, they immediately think of robbery, because as long as your fists are big and your arms are strong, or you have knives and guns in your hands, you can turn what is mine into yours. Everyone knows that this business requires no capital.</p>
<p>However, robbery is, after all, a serious crime. If caught, you will be sentenced to several years in prison at best, and you will be asked to wait eighteen years to be a young man again at worst. Therefore, although this business does not require capital at first, the interest paid later is too considerable. Some smart people, therefore, came up with another method, a method that is easier and does not involve great risks: theft.</p>
<p>Picking pockets on the street is a small thing; embezzling public funds and creating false accounts is a big thing. These things, if the case is solved, do not pose a threat to life, and the benefits are far above robbery. This is welcomed by small adventurers who avoid the heavy and take the light. Similar to theft in that it requires no capital, but with different results, the wonderful thing is gambling.</p>
<p>Opening a gambling den can certainly make money, and you can even rely on clever tricks to be the dealer and show off capital that exists in name only, gaining a lot. Moreover, those who lose money, no, those who send money, are all willing. Although it is also an illegal act, at least there are fewer people who will report it, which can save a lot of trouble. Compared to robbery, not to mention, compared to theft, it seems to be a further step of convenience. Apart from gambling, all other tricks, methods, and deceptions used to obtain property can also be regarded as businesses with no capital. The most obvious examples are Taoist priests and monks, shamans and sorcerers, who either chant incantations or make alarming statements to make you obediently take out money for them to use. Fortune-telling by character analysis, making reckless statements, teaching you how to seek good fortune and avoid misfortune, and how to get out of bad luck, can also be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>This kind of business is almost completely legal, and the degree of security is even greater than opening a gambling den. As the saying goes, deceiving someone to death does not require compensation, which is what this means. However, once the deceived person becomes aware, there will inevitably be disputes and increased trouble. For the sake of 100% security and to avoid any future troubles, one should think of other methods. What other methods? Begging. Some beg from door to door; some "file a complaint with the land," some "adopt piglets"... As long as you reach out your hand or kowtow, coins will continue to come. The coins that go into the beggar's bag are his own property, and he can use them however he wants, openly and honestly, with no future troubles. This is what it means to be unwilling to become an official after being a beggar for three years. Begging seems to be the ultimate business with no capital.</p>
<p>However, what is obtained by begging is only coins: if you are blessed, you may see silver coins, but you will never see paper money. Although the business is safe, making money is too slow and uncertain. If there is a business that is as safe as begging and as easy to make money as robbery, then it is truly an unparalleled mantra and supreme blessing. Once implemented, the world will be at peace. Thinking about it, the ghosts and gods understand it, and heaven does not disappoint those who work hard. This kind of business has finally been thought of: issuing banknotes, issuing banknotes without reserve funds. Each banknote is at least one yuan, and others are five yuan, ten yuan, and even hundreds or thousands of yuan. As long as you print a few words on it and issue it, the cost is almost zero, but the value is so great. Occupying the most promising position in the business with no capital is undoubtedly beyond doubt.</p>
<p>If one yuan is worth one yuan, of course, you are earning it yourself. Even if one yuan is only worth a few dimes, or even a few cents, as long as it does not fall below the cost of paper and printing, you are still earning money after all. This is the ultimate achievement in the business with no capital. Is it not? In the past, Russia issued such rubles, and Germany also issued such marks. Although they are now worthless, they saved their institutions at the time.</p>
<p>However, the business with no capital that issues banknotes without reserve funds is truly amazing. Why don't all those who want to get rich do this? It turns out that some are limited by their talents and can only be robbers or thieves, but cannot be "financiers." Others, although they have the talent of such a "financier," have not yet reached the level of experience and can only continue to learn on the path of robbers or thieves.</p>
<p>Moreover, to get rich, you cannot specialize in one way. As the saying goes, the vastness of the rivers and seas also comes from not rejecting small streams. Therefore, a person who does great things and achieves great success often also does small things and small businesses. In order for the future of a group to be limitless, it is especially necessary for people to divide the labor and cooperate, and follow different paths to reach the same goal. Therefore, various businesses with no capital are still being carried out by individuals or groups at the same time.</p>
<p>I think if people in the world can truly engage in this, perhaps the world will indeed become civilized and progressive. Oh, what a great business with no capital!</p>
<h3 id="e65">Five Minutes (4) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Feng</p>
<p>As He Jing replied to this sentence, he had already walked close to the enemy commander. Facing the light, he had distinguished the vague face of the other party: it was a fierce statue. He gave a silent cold laugh at that statue...</p>
<p>The enemy commander suddenly turned off the flashlight.</p>
<p>A moment of silence immediately plunged into terrifying darkness. In that instant, they seemed to be replacing questions and answers with rough breathing. The horse seemed to be participating in this conversation as well.</p>
<p>In order to surrender to death, He Zheng obeyed the enemy commander's order and began to step onto the road to death alone. At the same time, the flashlight again opened its huge circle of light, shining from He Zheng's back to the distant front—the front seemed to be a small path of a new pass. The further he walked, the steeper the road became.</p>
<p>Although He Zheng had doubts about death with every step he took, his determination was constantly advancing towards the goal of death. His eyes were fixed on the light, and he was also carefully monitoring which direction death would fly from.</p>
<p>He struggled to climb upwards. Now, except for the slight disturbances of the shackles, everything was still as silent as usual. He Zheng complained in his heart:</p>
<p>'Where are you letting me go?' Is death so difficult?'</p>
<p>However, he realized that he had approached the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>"Jump down!"</p>
<p>He Zheng jumped out of the pale circle of light without hesitation. At the moment when his body had left the cliff, he still heard the communications officer repeating:</p>
<p>"Jump down!"</p>
<p>A minute later, darkness still embraced this steep and desolate mountain, as if all living things were suffocated by this more depressing night... (The End)</p>

<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>—War Zone Report—</p>
<p>Before Wuhan was abandoned, the headquarters of the ×th War Zone was stationed in Songbu, the first town of Macheng. Here, it connects Shangcheng to the north, controls Xiaogan to the west, shields Lihuang to the east, and controls Wuchang to the south, appropriately located in the central hub of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui; the southeastern war zones along the river in Guangji, Qichun, and Wuxue can also echo each other remotely. During the tense period of the Wuhan peripheral battles, Songbu was quite important. We originally wanted to enter the mountains from Luotian to join a torch parade like a group of wind, but suddenly heard the news that the cultural circles of Wuhan were going to Xinyang to comfort the troops. Moreover, the war on the Pinghan Railway was proceeding in the northern part of Jigong Mountain, so we decided to go to Songbu from the highway first. If time allowed, we also planned to go to Xinyang and Guangshan, and then return to Anhui via Shangcheng.</p>
<p>That night, we continued on our journey. The highway had already been automatically destroyed, so we had to rely on first-class feet and proceed quickly under the hazy moonlight. Experience told us that most of the time during the day would be wasted on hiding from the indiscriminate "egg-laying" of airplanes. It's better to be quick at night. "Only fifty miles. It takes at most six hours to run!" Everyone said nonchalantly, "However, it's still far from the Long March!" Someone was mocking Lao Yao, because he had criticized the Northwest Economic Investigation Group and expressed dissatisfaction with Du Chongyuan's riding in a car, so everyone often used this sentence to laugh at him.</p>
<p>The moon slowly set in the west, and darkness engulfed the earth; but before long, the blood-red sun poked its head out of the mountain hollow. Looking into the distance, the branch veins of Dabie Mountain—Lishan—were initially hiding in the misty dawn, but at this time, they had already revealed their true faces. We patrolled the town once, and then walked along the winding path.</p>
<p>In front of us was an ancient temple, surrounded by tall willow trees, so quietly moving, and groups of war horses were gnawing on the green grass on the ground. Beside the temple gate, we saw Councilor Chen Dongzao.</p>
<p>"Did you just arrive?" Councilor Chen asked.</p>
<p>"Yes!" I said.</p>
<p>"Then, let's go inside to talk!"</p>
<p>The ancient temple is the ancestral shrine of the Qu family. The Grand Tutor Qu Yuan, who drowned in the Miluo River, was their ancestor. Councilor Chen told me: the entire Political Training Office had set off. He had not yet received a telegram from the Wuhan Office about when the troop-comforting delegation would arrive. If we wanted to go to Xinyang, he could find a way to get a truck.</p>
<p>In the evening, we stayed overnight at the headquarters. Swarms of mosquitoes, as if unwilling to miss the opportunity, attacked together under a general mobilization order.</p>
<p>Unable to fall asleep, let's hum a few crooked poems, the poem says:</p>
<p>The sound spreads through the battle signals,</p>
<p>How many brave men sleep with their spears as pillows;</p>
<p>Here, the crowd conceals the vast moon,</p>
<p>What is the night scene like in Jiangnan?</p>

<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Feeling oneself small and insignificant, one becomes more despairing.</p>
<p>Like a dwarf standing before a "giant," respectful, constrained, and full of timidity. Humiliation is like a brand burned into the skin, so deep that you cannot confidently wash it away.</p>
<p>Centuries of deep hatred, engraved in the bones and imprinted on the heart, passed down from ancestors tens of thousands of years ago, have also carved many scars in the depths of everyone's heart. The welts of humiliation come year after year, blood congeals and forms scabs, and the scabs fester and turn into pus. Pain brings back many memories, like a string of beads, threaded with the rosary of humiliation.</p>
<p>Humiliation cannot be forgotten; over the years, it has piled up high and thick. Thinking of the past is often a bitter dream.</p>
<p>With the nest broken and a lifetime of painstaking effort ruined, your family may unfortunately die as strangers in a foreign land, buried in a tiger's den. All the ruin and misfortune oppress you, leaving you unable to breathe. When there is no forgiveness or leniency, one's own interests outweigh sympathy. Thus, you will weep blood, tear your heart, remove your hat, and dishevel your hair.</p>
<p>"Centuries of deep hatred! Centuries of deep hatred! My tears wash, my heart grieves, my breast is filled with sorrow."</p>
<p>Thus, everyone is gnawed by sorrow, brows are furrowed, hearts float, and legs ache with hidden pain. Anger stirs the muscles, but does not swell them; sorrow becomes a flowing stream, but does not collapse; the volcano emits a faint flame, but does not erupt. Women sob softly, drunkards remain drunk for a thousand days, poets write "Li Sao," and sleepyheads sleep forever, wanting to die.</p>
<p>You say, just sir, is this also being blind to the situation?'</p>
<p>I cannot help but feel sad, watching a group of people, broken and foolish, not forgetting their deep hatred. I suppress my pain, I pity them, and remain silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I understand, so I ask:</p>
<p>"Can you strengthen yourselves! Transform suppression into roaring: make muscles swell, streams collapse, volcanoes erupt, not just stir, trickle, and emit flames."</p>
<p>The vast crowd tries to roar. The air is like death, the wilderness like a tomb, mouths and tongues seem restrained; everyone thinks the same. The sword of dawn may be able to cut through the long night, and a loud, long song in the deep mountains where no one dwells may make the Chu sky entirely blue. So everyone starts to sing, a song of justice. Buried in their hearts for many years, cowardly forbearance, weak muteness. The song does not rise naturally, a bit hoarse, a bit trembling. Long neglect makes the technique somewhat clumsy, weak, the sound low, the tone chaotic. Not high-pitched, not majestic.</p>
<p>In the distance, jackals chuckle, mixed with the sounds of dogs barking and wolves howling threateningly.</p>
<p>The chuckling of the jackals gradually ceases, replaced by the sound of frantic running and charging, gradually approaching the source of the roaring. Savage commotion covers the roaring, everyone is dull. "Our roaring has invited danger." The timid are pale as death.</p>
<p>Gradually, the roaring sound changes from low to high, from weak to strong, from narrow to wide, from delicate to powerful. The boundless falling leaves tremble, fish and dragons listen intently, the river waves shudder, and the forest beasts are silent.</p>
<p>"This is not the roaring of the past." The jackals are all terrified, each looking at each other with new eyes. No more chuckling, no more ridicule, only serious attention and bowing of heads.</p>
<p>Rise up with clenched fists, and from now on you need not worry about being overpowered. If there is no hatred, you must swallow it; if there is no grit, you must chew it; if there are no thorns, you must bury them. There is hatred, but not silent dark clouds, the breath of a gentle breeze, the sadness of light rain. There must be violent winds, torrential rain, raging fire, and rushing springs. We must strengthen everything. Inwardly, we must open up; stillness must become dynamic; softness must become strong; shallowness must become deep; shortness must be lengthened; transience must become lasting; sparsity must become dense.</p>
<p>After a successful battle, everyone learns a skill: forging suppression into roaring: transforming emotion into action, and transforming long sighs into war songs.</p>
<p>Like white-hot iron forged into pure steel: those who were sad in the past are forged into a vengeful army.</p>
