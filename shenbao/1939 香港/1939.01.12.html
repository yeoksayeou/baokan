<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國中立法的修正問題</h3>
<p>美總統羅斯福在七十六屆國會席上宣讀咨文，於擁護民主。抨擊獨裁之外，又主張修改中立法。他說：「中立法在現行形式之下，足以便利侵略國，而不利於被侵略國，必須予以修正」。的確，美國現行中立法，在目前的國際情勢之下，實是一個贅疣，它既不足以保障美國不捲入戰爭的漩渦，而且消極地助長了侵略者的暴行，使自己的合法利益，也屢被侵佔。美總統有鑒及此，乃於本屆國會中，重又提出了修改的主張；這不但是被侵略者所渴望，而且是維護美國一切合法利益的必要措置。</p>
<p>美國現行中立法是一九三五年制定，一九三七年修正的。一九三五年秋間，正在意阿戰爭行將爆發的時候，美國的孤立派份子爲防止美國重蹈一九一七年的覆轍，捲入戰爭漩渦起見，就在國會中草草地通過了這中立法案。其要點是：（一）國際戰爭爆發，美國要禁止輸運軍噐軍火至交戰國；（二）禁止差國船舶輸運此種物件；（三）禁止美國人民搭乘交戰國的船舶；（四）取締在美國海上或領水中的交戰國的潜艇；（五）限制美國船舶由美國口岸供應交戰國的戰艦。這樣內容，流弊很多。就其大者而言，第一對於交戰國家，不分侵略者與被侵略者，而一律禁止軍火輸出，是無異削弱了被侵略者的抵抗力，同時消極地助長了浸略者的暴行。其次所謂軍火，涵義廣泛，實施起來，頗費周章。第三，借欵與交戰國，是上次美國捲入戰爭渦漩的主要原因，而在中立法中却並沒有加以規定。所以這中立法是擋不住戰爭的侵襲美國的</p>
<p>所謂國際戰爭，就法理上講，是一定要經過宣戰的過程的。意阿戰爭雖未經過宣戰的過程，但終不能否認它是國際戰爭，所以這個法案、還可以勉强運用。可是現在世事變幻，常出人意料之外。繼意阿戰爭之後，而有寓國際戰爭於內戰的西班牙戰爭。在這種戰爭形態之下，這個法案就失其作用了。因此美國便於一九三七年一月加以修正，禁運軍火到西班牙的交戰雙方，理由是西班牙的戰禍足以蔓延到西班牙的國境之外。又如一九三七年七月七日開始的日本的侵華戰爭也是不宣而戰的，美國政府雖以中日兩國，未經正式宣戰，始終未施行中立法，但是華爾街的金融鉅頭，却違背了美國大多數人民的意旨，破壞了美國在遠東的傳統政策，資助日本的侵略。其結果，是反而增長了日本獨佔中國的野心，攘奪了美國的在華利益。</p>
<p>具有遠大目光的美國政治家，早已大聲疾呼，指出美國政府必須採用有效的方法，制止侵略者的暴行。羅斯福總統的要求修改中立法，便是制裁侵略者的初步辦法。</p>
<p>太平洋與大西洋的洪流，巳抵不住侵略者的暴行，美國的孤立派還要想置身於一切戰爭之外是不可能的了。祗有積極起來，對侵略者採取有效的制止方法，纔可維持世界和平，保持自己的合法利益。現在國會開慕伊始，吾人深望參眾兩院都能接受總統的意見，把中立法澈底修改一下，將不利於被侵略國，有利於侵略國的原素，剷除凈盡，更積極地進而制止侵略者的暴行！（編者註：關於今後中美關係及太平洋之大勢，另有本報專訪之我國某著名外交家談話，見今日本報第三版，請讀者注意。）</p>
<h3>所謂「三原則」與「新秩序」</h3>
<p>— 朱家驊</p>
<p>當日本瞬將發動大規模侵略中國戰爭的前夕，其首相廣田在議會演說，提出了的興謂對華「三原則」，卽是：（一）承認偽滿洲國；（二）中日經濟提携；（三）共同防共。後來有田大使挾此原則來到南京，儘管怎樣威脅恫嚇，中國不爲所動。因爲中國不但要堅守自己的立塲，維持其領土主權的完整，而且斷難遷就侵略者的狂妄要求，以致影響友邦的地位，陣礙東亞合理的進步。</p>
<p>大家還不應該忘記，在廣田演說之先，即一九三四年四月十七日，日本外務省情報司長天羽英二，曾經發表聲明：（一）日本在中國有特殊關係，故對中國態度與各國單不同；（二）日本爲保持東亞安定，故對中國不採得不取獨行動；（三）日本反對中國利用他國勢力以抗拒日本任何舉動；（四）凡外中國給予國技術上或金融上之援叻而議成「共管之局勢」者，日本决然反對之。我們拿「天羽聲明」和「三原則」對照去看，很醒目的是日本一面要淪中國爲其保護國，一面要把各國在東亞的權益和優勢排除凈盡。</p>
<p>—八閱月來的中國英勇抗戰，負起了兩重使命：保衛國土和維護人類正義。中國並日矢志不渝。蓋日本的陰謀，中國單燭無遺，不論日本軍閥或其代言人怎樣掩飾。中國絲亳不爲所惑。正因如此，日本首相方衛十二月二十二日的聲明，要建立什麼「東亞新秩序」，——「所謂東亞新秩序云者，卽在日「滿」支三國政治經濟文化各方面之密切連絡與互助，以阻止赤禍，擁護東洋文明，撤除經濟壁壘，才使中國脫離半殖民地以期東亞之安定」——這種白欺欺人的老調，司空見慣，中國人並不引驚異、這不過是「三原則」和「天羽響明」的重複說明，並且只是田中滿蒙大陸積極政策的一部份詮釋。</p>
<p>所可驚者，當田中滿蒙大陸積極政策公表之後，有些友邦人士甚至將信將疑，以爲日本的侵略計劃不見若是廣泛。然事實逐步演進到今日，日本軍閥的猙獰面目，全貌畢露。日本要滅亡中國，日本尤要獨勒東亞，是不能否認的了。</p>
<p>毫不置疑的，誠如出中奏摺嘉所說：「欲征服全世界，必先征服中國。」征服中國不遇是日本軍閥向全世界進攻的手段。而現在他們已開始向西方國家桃戰了。</p>
<p>日本容在中國淪陷區域內，排除了友邦由條約取得之權益，同時屢再聲明，「門戶開放」，不復適用，九國公約，應予修改，而對於美國之抗議，故意閃爍其詞，不爲正面之答覆，其蔑視一切，昭然若褐，無庸推論。</p>
<p>侵略橫流、無一倖免，中國察覺了，所以不惜單獨抗戰，友邦於今亦已察覺了，縱嫌稍晚，仍不過晚。故英美平行行動的發軔，己使日本着急，捉襟見肘然荀欲收制裁的實效，非及時的予以打擊不爲功。過去議日本坐大其勢，今後再不應有片刻的姑息。否則玉石俱焚，莫由追悔。當中國處×人加緊抗戰的新階段，譁以此互勉之意獻貢於我友邦人土。</p>
<h3>四川第一大鹽塲　抗戰熱潮中的自流井</h3>
<p>— 吳雪</p>
<p>四川有二十六個產鹽塲、自流井是全川最大的一個產鹽區、「太平天國」以後、便開始了它的繁榮、最初是用水牛推滷（孵水）、現在已進展到用機器推鹵了，東西兩場共有機推井八上七口、在將要走近口流井時、便遠遠的看到凉膏山大坟堡的聳人雲霄的天車、煙霧漫天、機聲軋戰、這裏已經具備了一個大工場的外貌、比起尙停留在原始工業時期的爲五通橋的鹽場、已是進步相偉大多了、此地燒鹽、通是引用地心的瓦斯氣、這裏的鹽井、把水推完了便出火、也有出火（瓦斯）同時也有水的、不過出火的井、水淡此、鹽質較少、瓦斯的火美極了、用管子把它引出地面、用火去一點便燃起像酒精一樣的火燄、熱度很高、看來只有一尺多長的火舌、一畫夜可以燒出四五百斤鹽來、一個井眼最多有可撥出八九百個水頭來的、便可燒八九百口鍋、</p>
<p>自流井在三年前、我曾經來過、那時交通並沒有現在方便、井內（內江到自井公路）和自流到威遠到榮縣、到鄧井關的公路、都是近一兩年才完成的、此地產鹽區分東西兩塲、東場（自流并）南鹽地帶以大坟堡凉膏出爲最、西場（貢井）以長土艾葉難扇子嘴爲最、自流井隔貢井十餘里、有公路、深夜可行車、聞將於明年元日、正式設立自貢市、現己有市政籌備處的設立、</p>
<p>自抗戰開始、蘆鹽被侵、兩淮淪、自流并在鹽務的地位上、便更形重要起來、許多省外的實業家、都想在此地來投資和從事開發、如范旭東的久大精鹽公司的遷川、現在巳經在自流井設立了一個大規模的精孵造廠</p>
<p>目前爲了適應抗戰的要求和後方的需要、不能不大量的增加生產、從去年九月起、巳由每月產二八〇、一五八、四一市擔（約數）增至每月產四二七、七一七、〇七中擔（約數）、這對國家的豐收、確是一個不小的帮助、只是自武漢撤退後楚岸（湖北）的銷場、多少受了些影響、因之他們在大量增產之下，現在到是大大心感銷路的苦悶了、</p>
<p>自流井並不是有怎樣大的一個都市、熱鬧的只有一條街、原先也是、只是一個鄉鎮的樣子、只是這裏却是具備了，都市的一切條件、有銀行、有旅館、有浴室、有戲園，有漂亮的理髪店和也有荒淫與奢侈、有個川戲院、票價五角、大天客滿、經常演出新南華堂白蛇傳等、有些的太太小姐們需要看南華堂田氏思春、白蛇傳的白娘娘船舟上情、抗戰對她們、好像仍然沒有多大關係、</p>
<h3>各國記者的中日戰爭觀</h3>
<p>— 陳盛智譯</p>
<p>自我第二期繼續抗戰以來，日×已大感其國勢已漸消頹，倘不早設停戰，即無以自拔；因之四出奔呼和平，7　　　　7一。最近日當局為要求教於各國「中日通」記者，特於去冬在上海華懋飯店召開所謂「國際記者現地座談會」．被邀到會者有英，美，法，德，瑞士等國人。日×原想從各國記者口中，得到宜揚其武功，不料反遭各國記者嚴詞指摘，大討沒趣，其難兄難弟之德國記者亦以日本之變幹相爲難。可見公道自在人心，正義不因侵略者之欺騙而氓滅。原文載「中央公論』十二月號，特爲譯出，以饗讀者。——譯者</p>
<p>日本記者中央公論社特派員小森田一（以下簡稱小森）：今天蒙各位於百忙中到這裏來，非常感謝。由於此次武漢的陷落，中日戰爭的情勢已展開至新的階段。在這個機會，很希望各國記者對於中日事變的當前問題及今後的透視能盡量地以「客觀的眼光」發表些公正的意見。星克先生是剛從陷落後不久的武漢來此的，不知道對於中日事變有何見教？</p>
<p>德國人民觀察報漢口特派員星克氏（以下簡稱星克）：中國方商的第四期抗戰能繼續到何時是另一問題。事實上，抗戰是依然既定方針繼續而行，且非無繼續之可能。武漢失陷後不久在重慶所開國民參政會第二次會議，在蔣介石報告書中曾謂：中國軍應於誘致日軍深入西部諸省·佔得地理上的優越條件時，實行决戰。此種戰略是否得當，是一問題。不過相信中國軍於誘致日軍深入腹地時能如意地達到消耗戰的目的。日軍的重砲軍器及其他近代式裝備，雖發揮過相當威力：但若深入腹地山區地帶，則不僅重砲及新式機械化部隊無用武之地對粉碎中國陣師之大型軍艦艦砲的攻擊亦將不能。他們（註：指我國當局。）認爲日軍一且深入內地，則中日兩軍的裝備，除飛機外，大體是沒有差異的。况且中國方面不僅有壓倒日本的豐富的人的來源可以作戰。還企圖以全面的游擊戰攪亂日軍的後方。目前從表面上看，中國很有賴於蘇聯的援助，但在蔣介石心中未必希望與蘇聯作百分百的合作。就共產黨方面，例如周恩來等較之一部分國民黨要人還要來得現實的。</p>
<p>小森：請武德先生發表些關於廣東，武漢陷落後，中國政權的去處。</p>
<p>英國東方時報主編武德里德氏（以下簡稱武德）：廣東，漢口，漢陽，武昌四大重要都市於數日之間相繼渝亡，這在蔣介石確是一大打擊，不過，到了今天還不能證明這是致命的打擊。中國對於抗戰的力量，還未抱疑念；蔣氏也仍舊保持着國民的信頓和支持。不用說，「蔣政權」事實上所及的範圍，巳經縮小，而且目下對外交通中斷，已陷入事實上的孤立狀態，運輸機關也非常薄弱。但是，這却不能說是「蔣政權，崩潰的兆頭。不，他不能容認無條件的和平，不是沒有理由的。我們應該說，在蔣介石失去的地方，不僅他的威信，而且仍舊是權力所及的地方。</p>
<p>最近的將來會發生什麼變化，現在沒有時間詳述。假設國民政府果眞是衰弱的，我想第一須有國共兩黨分裂的徵象。卽共產黨向西北移動，依頓蘇聯為唯一軍火供給國而繼續抗戰；一方面，蔣氏及其一黨則以貴州或廣西爲根據地，通過雲南。而保持對外連絡，仍舊是抗戰到底罷。</p>
<p>日本政府之决定絕對地不以蔣氏爲對手，無非意在指蔣氏的敗北，實際上反而使和平交涉陷入困難地步。大部份的外國人對這種决定是否得策實都抱疑問。去蔣决不是中國國民的要求，反而是以蔣爲中心，加强團結。在此時或不久將來，蔣若下野，其政治上的混亂，必甚於目前者無疑。提出一特定們人做對敵的對象，自然，不是日本獨具的政策。歐戰當時的凱蕯爾如此，最近希特勒對待捷克總統貝奈斯氏亦是採取類似的方策。不過這種方策，須以某特定個人具有實際以上的勢力與權力爲前提。萬一蔣氏下野，中國的抗日陣綫未必瓦解，國民政府亦未必倒台。</p>
<p>小森：對於同一問題，霍斯氏以爲如何？</p>
<p>英國華北日報副編輯霍斯氏（以下簡稱霍斯）：雖然他們認爲「蔣政權」既成一地方政權，但在獨立的外國觀察者看來，都未必盡然。「蔣政權」在軍事上朴繼退却，經濟上的重鎮不斷淪失是甫實，而現在蔣氏所有軍事勢力，財力以及一般國民所支持的地域的縮小亦是事實，但是，他的背後仍受民族抗日情緒的高潮所支撐。財政上，由海外華僑的捐輸得到意想以上的鞏固。華僑都相信現在的蔣政權即呈防衛中國的主權與設立的唯一政府。因爲華僑對於政府要人——如蔣介石等——的信賴，在精神上，財政上都能予以繼續援助無疑。華僑的富翁甚多，他們當然以最惡的看法去解釋日本的大陸運動。</p>
<p>据說，蔣政權接受着英、法、蘇、德、捷克等國的援助、但是任何一國的援助不如以華僑方面的爲有力較爲確實。對蔣氏今後政策的决定，這些事實的不能忽視也是確實的事。</p>
<p>但是在何種情勢之下，最容易使華僑的援助斷絕呢？第一當蔣權屈服日本。被認爲屆弱者的時候；第二，當過於急激左傾，與共產黨及蘇聯發生公然的同盟關係的時候。</p>
<p>小森：戰事發生後的中國民埃運動如何？</p>
<p>美國上海晚報主筆古蘭德氏（以下簡稱古爾德）：關於中國民族主義的强化，任何其他外力的作用，都不若日本的對華作戰來得有効力。自一九二六—七年的革命時期，中國國民爲反抗軍閥政治開始統一政權以來，已經强化起來了。</p>
<p>依我所知，日本人對於中國民族精神的發達程度的看法是犯了很大的錯誤，日本人總以爲中國人的性格是個人主義的，不以國家民族之利益爲前提，而着重於一家一族，即是不能視國家如家庭的民族。也許國民黨曾犯渦不少誤謬但他實際上較舊軍閥政治具有進步性的事實，却爲大部份的日本人所未能認識，以爲中國仍然是軍閥支配下的國家。這種誤解，實在不能帮助中日兩國的互相理解。</p>
<p>許多人知道中國處於多年的軍事上混亂狀態的事實，但他們同時忽略了中國人自已在爲改善此種狀態，而努力善而進步着。我相信在民族復興的堝程中，不單是日本，就是英美或其他列强，都有排斥外來壓迫的傾向，中國亦未能例外。多數的中國人不但因這囘戰爭而强化了民族運動，向左的傾向也很濃烈。如果今後戰爭繼續不斷，則中國的將來必定發生一種重要的傾向無疑。</p>
<p>小森：中國的智識階級目下採取着怎樣的立場呢？</p>
<p>克爾得：目下的中國知識階級採取着怎樣的立塲？這已經不是問題了。（中略）他們現在是處於國難時期，他們只有一個希望。我想，這點是日本人很少了解的。中日兩國政治理解的相違，只有基於正義的基礎才能得到解决，假使日本，如現在的軍事局面，欲以武力决勝一切。欲以生命的血去奪取中國，可以說，中國的知識階級將全勢力地傾倒於共產主義。這巳成爲必然的趨勢了，假使日本的知識分子站立在今日中國知識分子的地位，是否能採取別種的態度呢？</p>
<p>小森：這豐不是武漢失陷後共產黨的志向的表白嗎？</p>
<p>德國報界代表康明氏：共產黨的思想和行動的最好培養所是混亂時代。現在的中國軍隊多游擊化了。中國共產黨即利用此種時機，灌輪共產主義思想，傳授赤色戰術；而且盡可能地普及於一般大眾之間。此種徵候已開始發展。共產黨已掌据了一部分游擊隊的指揮機。游擊隊員的志向與决意亦鄰受此種共黨中央機關的影響。將來必然完全附屬於陝西的所謂紅軍司令部的麾下無疑。甚至在日軍佔領地域內，亦秘密地設立了中國共黨的新根據地。着手於坤方人民的爭取。不過，此等中國紅軍，共黨勢力是否從此擴大强化。頗難下肯定的答覆，它的成功與否，一方面要看地方人民的態度，一方面要看所策應的政治的與軍事的能力如何爲定。中國農民，假若不從背後予以强有力的組織力量，必無自動起來對抗赤色勢力的可能。</p>

<p>小森：最後，各位站在第三者立塲，爲了「東羊和平」的復興，對于中日兩國有何種期望呢？</p>
<p>英國「財政興商業」雜誌代理編輯依凡：如何達到中日間的永久和平呢？這是最重要的問題。鄙人自一九零五年以來，卽來往于中日兩國之間，對于兩國國民都抱着極好感情。我以爲中日應以最友誼的態度共存共榮，而且我想這並不是不可能。過失不能單指任何一方。現在沒有餘容詳細中日關係，亦不提及過去的狀態以及未來所認爲的問題。</p>
<p>我想，永久的和平，只有當作協力的賜物才可以得到。此種協力不生，自友誼的理解外面，亦非武以屆服，壓迫，服從所可得到。所謂「協力」就是要向着共通的目的，自動地共同努力。</p>
<p>鄙人多年在遠東生活，至今不忘的是距今約三十年前，中日的眞正協力。那時中國大企業家，特別是煙草製業者，印刷業者之招聘日本技術顧問，容許日本的投資具有靑雲之志的中國靑年，一批一批往日本留學，中日協力是在無形中自然進展着。我們在三十年前親眼看到如此情形。後來，中國國民革命發生，繼之世界大戰，其時日本的行動，在我所看到的，已到中日協力的最後，而沓入了統治的時代。中國的所謂排日，也就發生於此時。諸君該知道一九一五年的二十一條件問題，遭遇到損傷最厲害的中日關係，已經得不到調整的機會了。雖然當時曾盡了最大的努力。想用外交手段來改善中日關係的破綻。但提，結果已爲除武力之外亳不相信的人們所妨碍，而趨於不能成功。</p>
<p>近衛，川越，有田，故有吉，本多態太郎，佐藤尙武，結城豐衣郎，吉田政治，演田，尾崎行雄諸氏等在今日事變爆許久以前，曾經發出警告，强調對華的再認識；但是「兩重外交」帶來了非常的不幸。中國的反日情緒益因日本的態度而普及而激然起來。在一九三七年二月譯會上，尾崎曾作如是演說：「假若日本眞要中國的友誼，應當坦白表示。」</p>
<p>如果質問我中日間的永久和平應該如何確立，我的答覆是先請日本實行上述指導者的忠告。中日兩國沒有相棄的理由，有許多共通點的隣邦同志當然應有親善關係，我想這也必定是大多數國民的希望。然而阻害這兩國之密切麗係者誰乎？過去數年來，特別在一九三一年以來，中國的反日情緒是最高潮是何故乎？要先看出磨擦的原因，除去磨擦的原因，然後可俟永久和平的到來，日本政府如能容納先覺者的忠告，向最善的方向努力；我相信中國方面也必定以眞正的協議來報答她。</p>
<p>小森：霍斯先生的意見如何？</p>
<p>霍斯：以武力實現遠東的和平，在此數年之間或有可能。歷史的証明，以恐怖觀念爲基礎的和平是沒有永久性的。徹底的鞭打，中國或許屈服於一時，但是日本不能使中國人忘記了他們的「飯碗被打破了。」（中略）大亞東亞主義的理想巳爲最近的事變所紛碎了。許多觀察者看到：「東亞人的東亞」這句口號已不能冉施之於中國人了，因爲中國人正在遭受着同是東亞人的侵略旗屠殺。站在中國人的立場，恐怕第一要喊的口號是「中國人的中國！」</p>
<p>小森：各位似乎還沒有理解「聖戰」的眞意羲。古爾德先生的意見怎樣？</p>
<p>古爾德：不管在連東，在在何地方，永久的和平除止義的和平而外是得不到的。當然，正義二字的想法，因各國而異，但是事實相同。比方日本人對中國自以爲採取公正的態度，但中國人並不認爲公正。解决這個正確性的唯一方法，就是交換立塲，設身處地相想，把是否「已所不欲勿施於人」反省一下便對。照我看來，日本是把中國及其他國家的挑戰，攻擊想像得太過火了；反而不認識要領他國領土，破壞他國卽使和平，也不會是永久的和平。日本雖然聲明已作和平的準備，但軍部的勢力是否能同意並實行協約却是疑問。日本或認爲列强在盡力的支援中國，事實未必盡然，我想列強所望於中國者爲中國能成爲一自由獨立的國家，而能開放門戶，應許列强的通知貿易，列强所不安者是日本獨占中國的產業，資源與市塲而排斥其封華貿易與在華貿易。曾聽過許多有責任有地位的日本人說，這不過是中國人和外國人的杞憂，甚願邊種不安是杞憂，所以我們敢期待着眞正和平的到來。可是事（未完）</p>

<h3>名外交家自美回國　談太平洋大勢　對中美關係有重要揭示　就國際形勢斥主和誤國</h3>
<p>（本報專訪）我國某著名外交家，新近由美囘國，本報記者特往訪於其港寓，叩以中美關係及太平洋之大勢，承發表談話如下下：</p>
<p>「自八一三中日戰爭爆發後，美政府人員，自羅斯福總統以下，莫不對我表示同情，惟美國民間之輿論，則多以爲在道羲上儘可深切同情，而在方式上，仍反對對日制裁，惟一之例外，則爲一部分之知識階級及勞工階級，蓋彼等自始卽主强硬對日也。</p>
<p>勞工階級與資產階級之關係，有如轎夫與坐轎者，轎夫雖強硬欲走某一倏路，而坐轎者不贊同，仍愛莫能助。今則坐轎者亦在開始採取強硬態度，蓋有兩大原因：（一）美國對華商業幾被日本排斥凈盡。在華之美商向來不敢批評日本，今乃不能不以商會名羲明白要求政府出而援助矣。吾人須知在華美商，多爲其國內大企業公司之代理人，故在國內有極大勢力。（二）日本自對華作戰以來，現金準備流出不下四分之三，故美商認爲日本已非一最好的主顧，不妨稍爲強硬，今日所以尙有若千顧慮者，實因日本有剩餘之若千規金準備，不能不「虛與委蛇」。</p>
<p>美國爲一民主國，而非獨裁國，美總統决定一重大政策以前，必先審視輿論之向背。但美總統雖無強迫輿論之權，而有感化與論之力。羅斯福在支加哥之「淸疫」演說，乃一試探國內輿論之工具。（其主張召開比京九國會議，則爲試探國際輿論之工具）繼覺民眾反對者約居十分之七，故不敢燥切從事。然仍派戰艦二艘，乘赴澳參加某項典禮之便，駛往英國遠東海軍根據地之新加坡，隱示英美海軍合作之可能性，予日本以重大刺激。但當時美國與論仍多表示反對，不過未有如「淸疫」演說發表後反響之激烈耳。</p>
<p>因日本對華之暴行，及壟斷各國在華商業之結果，美國輿論遂漸擁護政府，自爲事實。在此種輿論演變期中，如美日關係突然發生一重大事端，如潘南號之被炸，則極易引起嚴重之衛突，甚至戰爭，猶憶「潘南」號被炸消息傳到美國後，美國民氣激昂，達于極點，而政府亦確有不惜一戰之决心。如日政府不迅卽道歉，并承認賠償，則戰事殆無可避免。</p>
<p>論及太平洋上之國際形勢，有一重要關鍵，卽英美合作是也。依余觀察，今後英美二國之邦交，必更親密；蓋一則英美商約已簽字，經濟關係大爲改良，二則戰債問題最近必有一解决辦法，可以斷言。以前英美對於遠東戰爭，皆不欲有所創議，而甯觀望形勢見機而動，今則己有變化，即兩國採取並行政策，互相携手，决不彼此推諉，此觀於最近英美對華借欵，已可見其一斑；而就兩國之海軍合作言，尤可深信不疑。大概英國海軍在太平洋上所担任之防線，係自新加坡起，向東南行經澳洲紐西蘭，而至南美極端之Cape　Horn，而美國防線則自加省之Pedo　San向西南行，經檀香山關島，而至馬尼拉。同時，英國擬編成一太平洋艦隊，常駐新加坡，而美國則組織一獨立太平洋艦隊，以預防日本。吾人須知，英國迄今祇喃北海與地中海二艦隊，用以分別防備德意，而遠東艦隊，則僅具雛型，美國海軍分駐太平洋與大西洋，專恃巴拿馬運河以爲溝通之孔道，一旦發生戰事，亦甚難彼此相顧，再就美國海軍力量言，美日艦艇之噸數相差，雖爲五與三之比，而言其戰鬥力，則近在二年前，尙爲五與六之比。換言之，日艦之噸位雖不如美，而戰鬥力則有過之。蓋通常一戰艦之靑春期爲十八歲，過此即老朽，美國自華盛頓會議後未有大規模之造艦計劃，而日本則看着進行，故戰鬥力不如日本，直至二年前美國始積極擴充海軍，去年度共費十五萬萬金元，本年度尙將加倍，此外，再加以英國之海軍力，自足以應付日本。</p>
<p>一艦隊之編成，殊非易事，建造戰艦一艘須費時兩年，用欵數千萬，而一正式艦隊之組織，須包括大小各級戰艦及補充船艇一百二十五艘，至一百三十六艘（大抵戰艦七艘，重巡洋艦八艘，輕巡洋艦十二艘，餘爲驅逐艦，魚雷艦及運輸等艦。）今英美二國之計劃，皆在積極進行，二三年內當可完全峻事。屆時對于日本，自可任意處置，可見今日太平洋上國際形勢，確在好轉，吾人何必亟亟與×言和，使英美縱欲助我，亦苦時間不够乎？」紀者最後又問：「然美海軍力，既在日益擴張，且有英國之助，日本果不敢旗美開戰乎？」答稱：「此爲不然，盡日本乃一瘋狂者當權之國家，狂人秉政，何所不爲」云。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>全國行政改進</h3>
<p>我國這次抗戰，是民族革命的戰爭，是進步的戰爭，因此隨着戰爭的堅持與發展，首先是促進了空前的全民族大團結，接着就是全國政治的進步。自從汪兆銘叛國陰謀敗露，我國再一次克服了和平妥協的逆潮，因此全國團結與政治進步。前途是更加光明了！</p>
<p>據十一日本報重慶電，中央負資方面現正商討改進全國行政，主要的是（一）戰區各省主席兼理軍政，地位提高，這是使政治和抗戰更密切配合的重要步驟，足以彌補過去政治趕不上軍事的缺點。（二）各縣長提高待遇，這也是十八個月抗戰經騐敎訓已爲政府所接受的表現，而是改善下層政治機構的重要步縣，但還應進一步普遍提高下級文官的待遇，嚴定懲獎黜涉辦法，澈底肅淸貪汚，轉移社會風氣。（三）各省臨時參議會，一律限於三月二日成立，也是非常値得注意的事，過去中央對此項初步民意機關的建立，確是十分重視，而各省未能依限呈報名單者，固然由於若干戰區省份有所困難，然大多由於地方當局及輿論界漠視其軍要性，政府與各抗日各黨團的解釋宣傳工作尤嫌不够。今後各方均應明瞭扶植民意機關，推進民主政治，是完成抗戰建國事業的重要步驟，我們要求抗戰建國快點變成，便得首先要求民主政治精神的普遍實現。</p>
<h3>英美制裁日本</h3>
<p>英美兩國如能聯合制裁日本，則僅經濟一端，亦足使日本侵略者迅速崩潰，或不得不放棄侵略政策，共謀正常的發展。問題就在於英美聯合制日是否可能？</p>
<p>英美在遠東的權益不同，英美本身及對日關係不同，英美相互間利害亦復不同，這是幾年來日本侵略者所以敢在東亞橫行無忌的重要原因之一。然而日本侵略勢力發展到今日，其所引起的對央美的矛盾，早已超過英美間的矛盾，因此英美聯合制日的條目已經經在，而且日益成熟，特別是直接受到日本侵略者威脅與危害的英美兩國對遠象工商業者，不斷呼籲英美聯台制裁日本，加以兩國與論與正義人士的督促，英美政府對遠東政策亦已日趨積極，這幾天華盛頓倫敦發來的電訊，並稱英美當局已在協商聯合對日，討論範圍還不限於經濟一端。再看今日本報所刊新由美國囘來的是著名外交家談話，更可證明英美制裁日本，决不是一句空洞的口號了！</p>
<p>不過我們要使英美制日早點實現和澈底實現，則不僅必須加緊一切改進交外工作的步驟，還必須盡一切可能，以加深日本的困難，使日本在國際地位愈加削立；同時盡一切力量，保障我國的進步，提高我國政府在國際的威信；這不僅有望於政府的努力，更有望於國人的奮勉。</p>
<h3>反侵略中國分會　一年來工作的檢討</h3>
<p>— 羽盲</p>
<p>對日抗戰的一切工作都是反侵略工作，這裏面包含着軍事，政治·經濟，文化……的諸部門，要是拿「反停略運動」做主題來作文章，就恐怕不是這麼小小的篇幅所能勝任了。我們今天要向讀者報道的。祇楚就國際反侵略運動大會中國分會一年來底工作的經過，來一次從頭的檢討，一來可向該會提供一點促進的意見，二來也可希望這個運動更加擴大和加强。</p>
<p>一個星期以前，筆者曾會過中國分會執行部的主任鄭彥棻先生，承他底好意舍訴我關於該會今後工作的開展；末了他還給筆者許些參攷資料。故此，鄭先生底好意，我是應該附帶致謝的！</p>
<p>歷史的回顧</p>
<p>中國分會底組織，實在是從去年一月起，才開始粗具規模，到而今，恰好活動了一年了。晚起它底名稱，很似乎有點杜撰，因爲日內瓦總會底原名，翻譯過來，該是「國際和平運動」的意思，然而，我們改爲「國際反侵略運動大會」，那不是很有點杜撰之嫌嗎？豈知「我們在抗戰很艱苦的過程中，畢抱定日本侵略一日不止，中國抗戰一日不休的决心；雖然我們最終的目的仍在和平，但我們所求的和平，必須是符合於公理正義的永久的和平」。（見組織須知。）那麼，這的樣一改，不是更有它底特殊的意義，和適合實際環境的需嬰？橫豎我們底抗戰工作，澈頭澈尾就是一種反侵略工作的。</p>
<p>說到分會底性質和工作範園，無疑的，它是一個「以反對侵略戰爭，保陣世界和平爲職志」的國際民衆團體。這個「不是軍事團體，不是學術組織，也不是政治集團」，所以，各黨各派。或是無黨無派，祇要他（或她）不是漢好，熱心于世界和平的保衛，努力於反侵略工作的，不論個人或團體，這分會，都是兼收幷蓄的</p>
<p>分會底建立；它是有着下面底四大原則的：</p>
<p>一，確認條約業務之尊嚴；二，運用國際協定，以減縮及限制軍備，幷取締軍火製造及販賣之牟利；三，邇用集體安全及互助的組織。增强國際聯盟之力量，以避免及制止戰爭；四，就國聯組織內建立有效的機構，以調整足以引起戰爭之國際事態。</p>
<p>我們上面說過，祇要不是漢好，便可爲中國分會底會員；這麼說來，它底組織的龐大和廣泛，那就不言而喻的。分會裏面底份子，分析起來，屬於個人的，有中國國民黨黨員，中國共產黨黨員，自由主義者。無政府主義者……；屬於團體的有國內的許多民衆團體。</p>
<p>分會和總會組織一樣，都是採取會畏制，由宋子文氏肩負了這個重大任務。在代表大會之下，有由一百五十人組織而成的理事會，另由理事會互選二十三人組織常務理事會，在理事會閉會期間，代行它底職備的。</p>
<p>分會是屬全國的。分會之下第一級地方組織是支會，以省爲組織單位。會址所在地設於省會；第二級地方組織是區會，以各省的縣市爲組織單位，那些會員人數過少，而却不能不有一個中心，以互相聯絡的地方，則設通訊處，隸屬於各地的支會或區會，——也許直接隷屬分會，現在，統計全國各省的支會，已有湖北，湖南，廣東，廣西西（這是最近成立的）的幾個，至於海外僑胞集中的城市，如香港，澳門，星嘉坡，菲列濱……等，都還沒有支的會組織；而以縣市爲單位的區會，現在更未談得到。</p>

<h3>游擊戰將有新的開展　趙侗先生的一封來信</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>委座對抗戰信心堅决，汪走是好現象</p>
<p>趙侗先生是游擊隊之母親——趙老太太的公子，亦是領導華北游擊隊的一員健將。他是愛國的同胞所景仰的二位實幹靑年，這裏，可用不着記者喋喋多所介紹。</p>
<p>趙侗先生是最近才離別香港的。當他過港的時候，頗引起各方面的注意與歡迎。他曾經在靑年會公開演講，亦曾經爲中央製片廠拍製時事影片。這些，這些，在讀者的印象中一定是不會忘記的。他離開香港之後到什麼地方去？近來的感想怎樣？將如何開展工作，這些，這些，必是愛國的僑胞所關懷的，下面這一封信，就是趙侗先生從重慶寄給本港××先生的，原信的內容就是這樣：</p>
<p>××老兄：我們已於廿七日抵渝。是日晚卽被新聞記者探悉，到住所訪問者，此去彼來，大有應接不暇之勢。我此來的目的本是宣傳抗戰。加强國人抗戰信心，行動公開自屬必要，已擬定於明日（一日）下午招待新聞界，公開講演後，再晉謁中樞當局。</p>
<p>我們回華北或參加華南發展游擊戰爭，須待晉謁最高當局後，才能决定。</p>
<p>委座對抗戰信心，異常堅决。最近曾决定幾個重要的口號：「政治重於軍事；民衆重於土兵；後方重於前方；××××××：游擊戰重於正規戰」這是計對目前抗戰的需要。對於軍事調整、政治機構的改善，均有莫大關係。「汪走非徒無碍於抗戰，亦會加强了抗戰的力量。這點使我們興奮極了！（下略）此致抗戰勝利之禮</p>
<p>小弟趙侗王明軒仝啓</p>
<p>讀了這封信之後，我們就發生了這樣的感想與希望：</p>
<p>第一，趙先生晉謁最高當局之後，對于游擊隊之策動定必有更妥善的佈置今後游擊隊之開展，必定有新的成績可以預明，這是足使我們無限興奮的。</p>
<p>目前的游擊隊，精明幹練的固然很多，可是，因爲種種的關係，流弊亦頗不少。美中不足原是在所不免。可是，若不及早克服缺點，澄淸弊害，很界易爲×人與漢奸利用爲口實，攻擊游擊隊之眞正價値，而上其挑撥離間之大當，所以，我們希望趙先生首謁最高當局時，能够盡量將下情上達，俾便最高當局之設施與佈置，能够切中時弊。</p>
<p>第二，「政治重於軍事，民衆重於士兵，後方重於前方，游擊隊重於正規戰」這原是衡山軍事會議時所决定的一般新國策，陶行知先生曾將此意向馬相伯老人報吿·馬先生拍手叫好，高喊中國得救了。現在得到趙先生同樣的報道，足證衡山軍事會議所通過的國策是已經吏普遍地爲各方所重視了。這實在是從血腥的敎訓中得到的進步。可是，讀者千萬不可以詞害意，以爲軍事，士兵，前方，正規戰就可以疏忽了，不足重輕了，從這個錯悮的看法，亦將發生很大的危險。我們要了解：照道理言：政治應與軍事並重；民衆應與士兵並重；後方應與前方並重；游擊戰應與正規戰並重。因爲過去的抗戰對于這幾個問題是有所偏視了，只是顧了一面而忽略了另一面，所以現在的矯枉是「針對目前的需要」。「矯枉」是必要的，可是萬不可「過正」。所以，亟布望讀者要特別重視信中「針對目前的需要」七個字。</p>
<p>第三，「汪走，眞使我們高與極了」是實在的話，因爲汪精衛之叛變，是不免的，他不能跟着時代進步，而硬要保持他的政治地位，所以只好不顧民族的利益，而拍扁自己的人格，以圖幻滅之前的「掙扎」。這個小小的波浪必定爲偉大的怒潮所捲沒是毫無疑義的。淘汰腐敗份子，使政治明朗化，這是進步的好現象。</p>

<h3>肺癆！肺癆！</h3>
<p>— 雋人</p>
<p>香港特多的產品</p>
<p>肺癆，可驚的肺癆—當我一聽到冬天人們受了傷寒而發出的咳嗽聲，就馬上使我憶起那可怖·殺人的肺癆來。世界上直到現在還沒有醫治肺病的特效藥，而中國人患肺癆病的是那麼多；尤其是在香港，每個星期據衛生局的報吿、害了肺癆而死的、總在一百人以上。每次看到這個統計表，便使我不寒而慄；香港，似乎是特別產生肺癆病的地方！</p>
<p>窖肺癆病的原因，除了遺傳或傳染的以外，是（一）工作過勞；（二）滋養不足：（三）空氣惡劣。住在香港的中國人，恰恰是配上這三個條件，患肺癆的，自然是特別的普遍了，貧困的中國大衆，只要有飯吃，也不計較到工作的過勞與不，每犬十二小時甚而十六小時的工作，把一切精神體力都戕賊光了，過勞不要緊，還要提防老板不滿意、打破了飯碗、工作的效率是最高，酹報的效率是最低，你想，在米珠薪桂，生活程度那麼昂高的香港，盡這一筆菲薄的酧報的享受，挺多也不過是吃得飽飯，每頓一磅牛肉，蛋或許鷄的高貴食料，不是面孔黃的人所能想到。結果，變成了一個生活素甲乙丙丁同時缺乏的人。</p>
<p>說到空氣，更不消提起，記得法國某大學敎授曾把都市中的空氣一立方米達加以分析，結果晨早七時有微菌六〇〇，到十一時增至一八〇〇，十二時二三〇〇〇，下午二時七二〇〇〇，晚上八時八八〇〇〇。照這樣看，都市中的空氣直是密佈微菌的，根本住不得，何况香港人口的稠密，是超乎任何一個繁盛那市的，幸而沒有人把這裏的空氣分折一下，否則，微菌數目必更驚人了，但是雖然住不得，却有無數的人在這惡劣空氣的氛圍中生活着，他們不是不怕微菌，他們不是不怕肺癆，却是爲着生活，不能不冒險，冒險的人越多，肺癆的傳播越廣，死於肺癆的統計的數字，只有每個星期的增加。</p>
<p>不久以前，有人發覺香港肺癆的嚴重是由於人口過密所致了。不錯，一層狹窄不堪的樓子，通常是三四十人居留的地方，對於衛生影嚮很大，原因發覺了，於是他們要設計改善；最直截的辦法，無如限制居住人數了，但是這是有錢人不切實祭的想法，住客却恨不得它能多住得幾個人呢！</p>
<p>我常地肺癆問題向一位醫生請敎過，他說：「如果仔細檢驗一下，香港人患肺癆病的總在半數以上。患這病的，往往連自己也不知道，等到發作了，却就無可救治了。我最近診治過）個小姑娘，她以前是很活潑天眞的，不像一個患病的人。後來因爲咳了幾個星期的嗽，吃咳嗽藥水沒有好吃，經用X光一照，發現她的肺部已有三個洞，肺癆已至第三期了。療治肺癆的方法，沒有什麼特效的樂物，目前最靠得住的，還是打空氣針。空氣針是俗稱，實在是叫做人工氣胸。肺臟經結核菌的侵蝕而變成了空洞以後，服藥固然不會有效，更是實行長期休養，也只好使體重增加而對於這個肺上邊的空洞還是有辦法讓它長好。人工氣胸，便是把氣體想法注入胸膜腔內，使空懸在胸膜腔內的肺臟，因爲受了注入的空氣壓迫而萎縮，肺臟上的空洞，因肺臟的萎縮而合口，口一合起來，久而久之，便長上了，痊愈了。對於氣體的注射，因爲任胸膜腔內是會消失的，所以要注射許多次，開始時兩三天一次，遂漸延至一星期一次。這種方法，有百分之八十可以痊愈，但有許多患肺癆者却不適用這種方法的。不過，我們對於肺癆還是防預勝於療治。」</p>
<p>這位醫生說完後，要替我義務檢騐一下，照一照X光鏡，看看沒有肺癆病。但是我終沒有這樣勇氣給他檢驗，我自家想：「倘然發覺我患了很重的肺癆病，那就糟糕了。我要吃飯，長明休養不得，我是個窮光蛋，療治了有錢。知道了還是自家受痛苦。現在究竟自家有沒有肺癆病，自家雖然不知道，但是工作如常，反而安樂得多了。橫豎香港是特產肺癆病的，有了，也不算是特殊人物啊！</p>

<h3>福州鼓山（二）</h3>
<p>— 邵晏清</p>
<p>走完這條廊、迎面又是一間大客堂、曰「星聚堂」、這兒我們遇到了一位執事的僧人、承他極力代我們設法在堂的左麻弄到一間僧房、原來在堂的右邊、本來有一座新建的樓房、叫做「明月樓」、這樓是該寺施主捐建、以供來客住宿用的、恰巧這天來了某校的學生三四百人、把這樓整座的佔據了、我們只好屈居僧房、嘗嘗一下出家人的風味、這間房子倒還寬大、排着三只床、只是四面沒有一扇能通陽光的窻戶、幸虧天花板上開了一扇小天窻、總算光綫勉强有了着落、空氣當然是談不到、剛進來的待候、迎鼻還送一陣陣臭的氣味、坐一會、便不覺得了、</p>
<p>我們在房中把隨帶的衣件安頓淸楚後、就匆匆跑出來參觀寺中的「香積廚」、最使我驚異的、是灶臺裝着的四只大鍋、每鍋直徑各長七八尺、鍋蓋因了太重的緣故、是用繩子吊着、用時只須以手摧動一柄、那繩子便在鍋中徐徐鼓動、我們進去時、鍋中正煮着滿鍋子的小米粥、熱氣騰騰、灶的背後、地面略低、一個燒火的齊公正在那裏把山中拾來的稻柴一把一把地往灶口裏塞、聽說這些齊公多係福建連江、興化等縣農民、因農村破產而離鄉求生、他們在寺中每年工資僅五六十元、惟膳宿則由寺中供給、所以比在農田中終年耘耕而不得一飽、尙勝一籌、</p>
<p>晚飯畢、信步至明月樓一游、此樓建築宛似學生宿舍，兩排房間聯在一起、一排一面南、一排面北、每排前面有一條長廊、我隨意地循着朝北的廊道走上去、從每間房子窻口望進去、小學生、中學生、三三兩兩的聚着談天、有的吹口琴、也有的園起來聽先生故講事、在長廊的另一角、一羣男女小學生正圍着一個穿中山裝的靑年、——大槪是他們的先生、——唱着愛國歌調、那靑年手中拿了一根尺來長的竹捧、不住地上下左右揮舞、歌聲也跟着抑揚頓挫、在這週圍都是消沉而頹廢的環境中、竟然也透着這一點積極的痕跡、這不能不令人感到相當的欣慰、</p>
<p>回到陰晴的「僧房」裏、談了一會兒、大家都感到累了、各進入被窩裏睡覺、翌晨黎明、卽起身盥洗、準備攀登絕頂峯、（按卽鼓山的最高峯）、原來我們住的湧泉寺、是在山的半腰、從該寺門前的廣場望上去、這座峯是在寺的背後、峯頂不偏不倚、恰對住大雄寳殿的殿頂、</p>
<p>七時許、我們開始從該寺後門出發、並僱了、乘轎、以備輪流乘坐及搭載隨身零件、最初一段我們是循着黃士山坡蜿蜓而上、穿過不少低矮的松林、愈往高上去、土坡漸不見了、只剩下光滑的山岩、上面鑿着淺淺一級一級的窟、幸虧大家都着膠底或布底鞋、所以尙不至滑跌、太陽漸次高升、熱度便隨着增加、我的衣服也跟着逐件地脫下來、走到佛手巖、身上只剩下一件內衣和一件襯衫、這時路程已走了一大半、仰觀絕頂峯、赫然如在眼前，峯巓看過去有一點像禿着髮的頭頃、光得連一根樹木也見不到、山頂將要釗達的時候、有石亭一、亭中供觀音大十香位、此外一無他物、亭右殘垣頹壁、野草亂石、饒有荒凉的古意、</p>
<p>過了石亭向前、便開始在山頭週圍盤、將近峯巓的時候、有一塊石碑、上書「通霄路」、石碑的附沂、有一條岔路、可通鼓嶺、（閩人避暑之處）、過此碑、山徑盤曲、風勢漸猛蓋絕頂即在眼前、這時我興奮極了、用手按住帽子、一鼓作氣奔到山頂、山頂倒還平坦、約一畝大小、近中間放着一只五六尺長的石凳、石凳週圍長滿了枯黃的野草、風是不停地狂吹、吹得根根草在狂舞、在這上面幾乎找不出一件東西是靜止的、我們的頭髮衣巾——一切都隨着狂風的旋律而飄舞、</p>
<p>從峯頂北望、一座座的高山靜默地起伏在週圍、淸晨的陽光、斜照到對山的山脈上、把一起一伏的峯巒、照得光暗分明、這種偉大自然的啓示、不由你心頭不湧起一陣愉快的感覺、最有趣的、便是名聞中外的福建古嶺、從這裏望下去、簡直像小丘一樣、只見一幢幢精緻的洋房、稀鬆地點綴在滿山頭、</p>
<p>峯頂上的岩石、多刻有前人的字句、類皆明淸年間題的、其中關於山峯方面的、有「無山與齊」、「半天山」、「登峯浩極」、「振衣」、「鼓頂」等、爲了風勢過大、我也無心細看、正待下山、忽聽轎夫道、那邊還有石亭哩、於是大家都不約而同地走到山峯的南坡、說也奇怪、這裏的氣候和剛才那邊完全相反、一切顯得溫和而恬和、近東南角有一座破毀的石高、翼然擱在一面大岩石上、亭上面的頂蓋已不知去向、只剩下兩根亭柱、一根豎立着、另一根幾乎斜得快倒下來、於此亦可見山風的威力、石亭附近、有一面六尺許高的石頭、上面鐫有「衆山一覽」四字、又有「海天一覽亭」「天峯海濤亭」等字、諒是亭的題名、由此再進數武、便到絕頂峯的盡頭、下面儘是些猙獰突兀的怪巖、於此環顧五虎諸山、但見雲海蒼茫、羣山隱現、那毬浩瀚洋溢的氣槪、令人爲之心曠神怡、俯瞰閩江、水路蜿蜓、如虹如如帶、西首銜接上游、把福州城和南台劃分開來、東首繫連爲尾和羅星塔、在這一條銀帶般的閩江、只有片片的風帆點綴在上面、間有幾艘小汽輪在江面徐徐地蠕動、要是不定晴注視、幾乎不覺得它們在行駛、沿江而築的福馬公路、在秋天的陽光下、像一條狹長的金黃帶、可惜來往的車馬太少、不免有冷落之感、此外便是一片茫無限際的田野、一架水上飛機、輕盈地從江西飛起、在對岸稻田上面打幾個盤旋、像一只小蜻蜓、機聲漸遠、機身也逐漸在糢糊中消失了、——這一切簡直是一幅美麗的秋日圖畫、使人流連不忍邇去、我攝了好幾幀山景的照片、到近午，大家才循原路下峯、想趕到白雲洞午飯、（未完）</p>

<h3>由長沙歸來（二）</h3>
<p>— 呂洞仁</p>
<p>我們以爲到長沙後、一定能够到漢口去、心裏終在希冀着、可是一抵長沙、車長就向我們說、「長沙到漢口的一段路、因被×機毀炸了、現在不能再開行了」、我們聽了這、不覺心裏頭酸痛了一回、這無情的×機、就會把我們這樣地阻斷了前進、這的確給予我們一個莫大的打擊啊、我們的前進、竟在此阻斷了襲、火車旣不能開行、那麼、只好於第二天到車站退票就是了、那晚是九點位鐘抵長沙下車時即見車站一帶地方、都是令人一見悲憐的烟火、這是×機所給的惠賜、我們下了車、兩人只儸了一輛人力車、在那電光徹微的街上、慢慢地走過了好幾條街口、才找到一間旅店、這旅店招呼很不鍋、裏而的設備也很周到、店夥都是湖南人、我們和他說國語，可以互相達意、因兩畫夜坐車的疲倦、在這一夜的睡鄕裏、才把我們的精神恢復了過來、第二天早晨、用了膳、×機來空襲了、旅店的主人很和藹的、他的名字叫做游金海、親帶着我們到一個鄕村裏去躱避、我們一跨出店門口、看見好多樓屋已成瓦礫、血肉遍地、一片凄凉情、實令人目不忍睹、這種慘象、祇有增加人民抗×的决心、畏沙雖天天給×機的騷擾、但市塲依然繁盛、路道相當寬大、游君帶我們這一家農人的家裏坐下了、但於緊急警報時、還須要走到森林裏去、這樣一直到下午四點鐘才解除了警報，畏沙可說是天天那有敵機來襲、我們因在這地情形下、只好回到衡陽、取道到廣西桂林、打算到了那裏、找點救亡的工作做、或有什麼可以學習學習的地方、警報解除後、我們還請諸君帶我們到車站去退蔡、幷購了到衡陽去的車票、在車站、最令人注目的、就是列車載滿着由前方運回來的受傷勇士、他們有的傷了脚、有的傷了手和頭部、下車後擺動着行走的苦况、實令人爲之起敬而憐惜、還有那些傷勢較重的、都橫臥在車站、有個連長傷勢很重、他的受傷處旣沒有藥敷着、當着那寒氣骨的夜裏、一時呻吟、一時吼痛、聽那悲慘的聲音、幾令人要落下淚來、你想、他又是凍、又是痛、可是他是多麼偉大、他是盡了國民的職任了、但不知留連在都市裏的公子小姐們、聽到了要起什麼感想呢、受傷的連長如此、下級的士兵吏不待言了、就可以看到我們這次的抗戰、對救護一層、是極需我們在後方的努力補助、那晚天氣冷得很、我幾乎被凍得要跳起來、一直等候了幾個鐘頭直到深夜方才有一輛車開行、在途中、×機還數次來偷襲、但我們很安全的於二十一日的下午抵達了衡陽、</p>
<p>長沙來衡時，同車有兩位姓李的廣東人，他倆是我們在車站候車時認識的，是衡陽的大米商家，抵至時由他倆介紹我們到一間廣東酒店投宿、衡陽防空設備比較完備、故心裏比較鎮定了好多、衡陽的商業頗爲繁盛、但有點特殊的就是理發生意、它幾乎全操於女人的之手、爲了搭車的方便、連我們兩個皮篋、也通通賣去了、我們把一切衣物打成一個大包裹、背起來、儼然是個旅行家、在這裏作一天的逗留、二天下午乘火車到桂林、由衡到桂州車費、不過是五塊半大洋、在售票處有汽車送我們到西站去上火車、</p>
<p>這是廿三日的下午到桂林、我們很是與奮、因爲這裏是我們久仰的省會、下了火車、有汽車來接送我們入城去、在將要進城時、到一所行李檢查處登記姓名和檢核行李、我們經過好多個城門、然後才進入市內去、下了汽車、即僱兩輛人力車到湘鄂旅店投宿，「桂林山水秀天下」的確不負此名、山勢的奇偉、從未見過、它是散立着的一個個尖峯、高出雲霄，一眼望去、令人別有天地之感，廣西的靑年男女學生、穿的是樸素的軍衣、精神奮發、實爲他日衛國殺×的戰士、還有農人工人商人、普通地都受有相當軍從事訓練、市內時時有防空的演習、人民秩序井然不亂、步步都依着政府的條規去實幹、廣西大學原在柳州、桂林只有中小學、中學對於車事訓練極爲注重、我們滿以爲一定在那裏可以參加到某一救廣團體去、但終不能如我們的願望、因爲我們自愧、旣未受到雌格的軍訓、又無救護學識、祗憑一股熱血心有餘而力不足、我們旣不能往前方去拚命、那還不如跑囘後方去努力、同時在白物昂貴的桂林、生活也將成問題、因爲我們剩餘的旅資快要用完了、桂林住了兩天、想再往南寧去、那時因一切汽車已作爲軍用了、僅偶有一二輛汽車能抵達柳州、這實恰巧得很、在汽車公司購票時、我們因想在桂拍電到安南求寄欵來、但不知當地有什麼銀行可以匯寄、我們一問就問着一位河南人、他也來車站購票到柳州去、他要取道釗安南河內後、轉抵雲南聯合大學讀書的，我們以爲在這里住下去旣不是善策、是最好能到安南去、臂位河南人非常誠懇、在我們談活中知首他姓楊、我們於是寫了一封懇的信給他、請他帮助與我們到河內去的旅費、他接着了我們底信後、便答應了我們的要求、我們得了楊君的帮助、心裏實在感激得很、而覺得是幸運了、於是我們一行三個人、於廿九早乘公共汽車向柳州馳去、由桂到柳的車費是七塊半錢、坐位很不錯、但在車上、若不帶起眼鏡、鼻口縛上手巾、你將會被汽車揚起迎面撲來的泥沙、弄盲了眼、塞滿了口和鼻、我們很快的於那尺的下午四點就抵達了柳州、</p>
<p>柳州，我們一到就聽見時時這×機的轟炸、那里極令×人注目的就是「廣西大學」、我們只住了一晚、第二天的晨早、因爲沒有客車、故只好再找加二人、僱一小汽車前進、這設到南寧的路道、很是平坦、又很少有×機去轟炸、沿途都是高出雲渶一個個尖峯的山、我們渡過兩條小河、經過好多個小市墟、整整一天的旅程、把我們又送到這新的境地來——南寗、</p>

<h3>本港粵桂閩土紙市况　粵桂來源斷絕　價格高漲一半</h3>
<p>我國粵閩桂各省出產土紙、最爲大宗、常年輸出頗佔重要地位、嗣因洋紙傾銷、土紙市塲遂蒙極大之影響、本港原爲土紙集散地、近來因戰事影響、故市塲更爲不振、茲將本港各省產品市情分述如下、</p>
<p>粵產：（一）長江玉扣紙、爲北江始興所產、向由韶關經粵垣來港、每年入口約計三萬把（每把五十斤）、以前每把價値六元、目前市價則爲每把九元、表面價格、比原日較賤、但以港粵匯價而言、前後相差遠甚、故現時價格無異比前、漲許多、（二）東莊玉扣紙、產自南雄及附近贛南一帶、每年入口約計五萬把、前價每把五元、現價把六元、上述兩欄、土紙運銷南洋羣島居大宗、佔全額百分之六十餘、百分四十則化消本市、（三）經文紙、此種爲學童字課所用、每把七十五刀、（四）重桶紙、爲製信竿之用、每把五十刀、兩種均爲扶漢百順等地所產、每年運港約計各二萬把、每把値二元半、查本港粵產土紙、每年留易達五六十萬元、</p>
<p>圃產：該省紙產以玉扣紙爲最大宗、爲製造帳簿及信紙之原料、品質優良、價亦較昂、國內外銷塲殊不弱、具外輸路線、向由汕輪運港、自去歲廈門失陷後、內地產新區亦呈緊張狀態、各紙廠出品極少、故港市來源隨之枯渴、查閩產玉扣分爲四刀莊、四刀半莊、五刀莊、及六刀莊、前兩欄最台本港中胃、每年澳港共五六萬把、上貨每刀（約十斤）五元、中貨四元、下貨三元、每年貿易約達二十萬元左右</p>
<p>桂產：（一）萬金紙爲桂林所產、此種紙爲鞭炮竹之原料、轉運澳門最多因該地多砲竹廠設立、每年入口約十萬把、每把値一元七角至一元八角、（二）玉扣紙，此種紙質甚粗、俗名草紙、每年入口約一萬八千把、每把値二元本地化消佔百分之八十、（三）紗紙、爲桂省紙產最人宗者、每年入口計七八萬把、每把値二三元不等、桂紙在港、每年貿易達（連運銷澳門）六十餘萬三、查目前午港粵桂產士紙、來源幾載、而閩日亦少、故紙價格比原日高漲、百分之五十、</p>

<h3>昨宵女子籃球　各塲竸爭頗可觀　培道，華僑，南華得勝</h3>
<p>【本報特訊】昨晚女子籃球賽、共有三塲舉行、因爲不是勁旅碰頭、情形不算熱、說到戰情、港大和西南兩隊勝出還可以、華僑戰港大、也頗緊張、塲面不錯、</p>
<p>六時半屆、戰神駕臨健身室裏、培道對西南、開球後、少西先藉罰球之使、直下兩關、打開紀錄、混戰些時、少西再取一隻、以三對〇佔先、西南各將以損失尙微、沉着應戰、很久、瑞心才替已隊奪回一隻、四比二完一節、</p>
<p>再戰後、奕隱乘着蟬聯犯規、加上一點、這時西南配枝趕到、替出翠容、士氣大振、惟奕隱投籃有如神助、頻有建樹、西兩各將祇有徒呼負負、戰至十一比六時、休憩時間又到了、</p>
<p>下半塲西南在培道控制下剛由瑞心配枝建下三次汗馬功勞之後、卽無所獲、但蟬卿紊貞打來很落力、因此培道雖能以二十比十一結束這節戰勝、但求免太吃力了</p>
<p>最後一節、西南還希望着把失地漸次收復、但培道各將也不敢有着輕敵的心理、因此績分依然扶搖直上、直至全塲終結、培道卒以廿八比十六的成績，氣走了西南、</p>
<p>第一場戰爭旣成過去、次塲角逐跟着開始、這一場是華僑對港大、本來、華僑的實力、比諸港大、實在優勝許多、然而為着榮棠缺塲、守光失了老搭擋的緣故、影響很大、加以港大自得文華重爲馬婦，指揮若干，守衛方面、調黎宗如暹後、又能施以人纏人的政策、實力不無增進許多、所以第一節終、港大在努力之下、竟能以七比四的成績、佔先一陣、</p>
<p>二節華僑演出比較上節落力、但因失去三分、收復需時、而且文華也曾幾度得手、所以戰至半塲終結、華僑祇不過以十六比十四佔先兩點而已、</p>
<p>三節華僑士氣更盛、守光左穿右挿、叫人很難捉摸、真是爐火純靑極了、這節港大祗是爭得罰球三點、因此績分漸漸落後、已不像初時的威風了、</p>
<p>尾節港人曾由文華連絡幾關」績分有逐漸趕上之勢、殊料五分鐘後、盛勢卽成過去、而且這、又距完場不遠、眼見才由文華罰中兩球之後、完塲之笛即鳴、二十七比三十二、華僑奏凱而返</p>
<p>末塲南華對懷雜、保羅多是新材、實力荏弱、勝理南華本可大勝特勝、却是爲了若梅煜分夫機屢屢、故比數還未相差太遠、說到戰情、有趣得很、然而爲着篇幅關係、恕我不多說了、續分如后、（籃底人）</p>
<h3>校際乒乓賽　九龍獲勝</h3>
<p>乒兵校隊聯賽、昨晚於仁對九龍、在東方會舉行、九龍棋高一着、以五比零擊敗皇仁、</p>
<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……冒牌小貴族</p>
<p>Lord　Jelf</p>
<p>是一部富有敎齊意義、同時會使每一爲人父母的、和一般孩童靑年們、感覺到絕大興趣的片子、</p>
<p>弗萊第巴塞羅繆、嘗在「塊肉餘生記」中、感動過每一個觀衆的童星、在這里他飾一個給敎養壞了的孤兒、受一對狡黜的騙棍的利用、訓練他胃稱某一貴族的兒子、四出行騙、後被捕、送入一所犯罪頑實學校、在那里被迫鍊習一些航海的技術、故事就是叙述他和一班與他同類的同學們的生活、同學之一、是由粗率輕快的童星麥蓋郎尼扮演，他在學校中已做到下級軍官、那冒牌小貴族、在一次私逃的時候、給他捕回、後來却成好友</p>
<p>我們還記得這兩個童星、嘗在「怒海餘生」一度合作、雖則他們所表現的性格迥然不同、但是很有相形益彰的功效是一對極好的搭當、現在他們的年齡已足稍徽長大、而演技也跟着更爲成熟、特別是對於年輕人的性格這一點，史是表現得活神活現、加上一個有趣的故事、和孩童們眞摯熱誠勇敢的演作、吏充實了本片的內容</p>
<p>皇后……大口女追海軍</p>
<p>Give　Me　A　Saflor</p>
<p>環莎蕾視鮑勃霍潑以前的幾度合作、成績皆極美滿、在本片中、更有優異的演作，証明他們還是一對極適合的搭當，片中有的是層出不窮的笑料、對於爲尋娛樂而看電影的觀眾們、是一部合乎理想的作品、</p>

<h3>田徑運動訓練法</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>總之、我們不應把那些照片完全作爲我們的根據、也應獨重一種或數種動作、應將一種運動所包含的各種動作加以精密的和有系統的研究、我們要追隨於著名的運動家之後、但如祇學上了他們的皮毛、不但沒有進展、往往反而後退、</p>
<p>對於田徑運勸家最重要的是各部動作的和合、欲使各部動作和合，必須同時施以發達肌肉的運動、田徑迎勁家的訓練應按步就班、先樹立堅強的基礎、欲有正確的方法和美妙的姿勢，頃從最基本的訓練入手，發達肌肉亦因各種運動不同的需要而異、例如擲鐵球則須特別注重肩、背、臂、胸、腿、臀各部、我們練習這種運動一方面要從最基本的方法入手、一方面要使肩、背各部的肌肉發達至最强健的地步、</p>
<p>一個田徑運動家的造就、最重要的就是基本的訓練、訓練一個初入手的人已很困難、因為初入手的人不僅各部動作不能和合、身體也不能平衡、但欲訓練一</p>
<p>個曾受錯誤的訓練的運動家則更爲函難、這種運動家當然也沒有登峯造極的希望、所以一個運動家如欲成名、在開始的時候就要受正常的訓練、</p>
<p>其實祇要動作和合、並能保持身體的平衡、田徑運動並不是一件困難的事、但欲有和合的動作與平衡的身體、必須先有健全的體格、</p>
<p>除須使在運動時最需要的肌肉發達到最强健的地步之外、身體上其他各部亦不可完全忽略、例如、有許多長跑或短跑軍用祇重退部的鍛鍊而忽視其他各部、其實最重要的部份就是軀幹、須知身器的重心就在軀幹之內、我們的力量和各種動作皆與驅幹有密切的關係、</p>
<p>例如、長跑或短跑家、他們腿部的動作完全依靠身體的基礎、卽是下腹和臀部等、又在跳欄或跳高的時候、控制腿部伸縮的動作的肌肉就是下腹肌肉、腰部肌肉、和直脊肌、在拋擲或推動的時候、如同時利用鋸形肌（位於正胸肌之下）和闊背肌（位於腋下）使身體扭轉的力量、所得到的成績必遠在祇是應用上臂雙頭肌和上臂三頭肌的力量之上、雖是有許多長跑或短跑家就把不少的時間浪廢在那些好將兩腿交替盡量向前和向後衆起等一類的運動上、他們以為這樣可以使他們有寬闊的步伐、更壞的就是他們過於注重小腿的肌肉、並不充分的利用大腿前面的四頭伸肌、也幾完全忽略了臂部相背部的肌肉、這幾部肉肌能控制腿部在奔跑時的動作、例如、雙脚和腿向後提起的時候不致過高等、在奔時都是要切實注意的、短跑家如集中於小腿的鍛練、雖然也能增進奔跑的速度、但不能達到最高的速度、並且到了相當的地步之後、進步幾完全停止、因為他們祇集中於小腿的鍛練、結果小腿肌肉雖甚發達，但其他各部必要的肌肉則過於落後、</p>
<p>許多田賽運動家也是如此、他們在拋擲的時候、祗靠臂部的力量、不會利用身體伸展和轉扭的力量、於是當他們拋擲的時候、身體後縮、兩脚交換位置的時候也過早、又有些敎練以為對於拋擲力最重要的份子紙是腿部、為這種運動中腿部的確是很重要的份子、且並不是最重要的份子、實際上、冽如用左手來擲鐵球或鐵餅、這種力量大部份來自身向左扭轉的動作、</p>
<p>所以、不僅是運動家、甚至敎練，對於這種運動皆須有深切和有系統的認識、田徑運動家的訓練，最重要的是基本的訓練、所謂基本就是指發達肌肉、身體的乎衡、以及和合的動作、關於發達肌肉、一方面要側重於那些必需的肌肉、一方面也要使身體平均發展、欲樹立堅强的基礎、必須按步就班、不可操之過急也需要恆心和堅强的意志、有抒多運動家在每次練習的時候、都想打破自己原有的紀錄、他們以爲這樣才能有急速的進步、目前他們的見解也許不見有任何錯誤、但是這樣練習的結果、必無登峯造極的希望、</p>
<p>現在因限於篇幅、不能將各種專爲鍛鍊田徑運動家的體格而設計的運動介紹給各位讀者、日後如有機會、常按次討論之、這毬運動的功效有三、（一）發達肌肉、適應各種運動不同的需要、（二）使動作和合、身體平衡、（三）使我們切實了解拋擲、奔跑、跳躍等作用的原理、（下）</p>

<h3>讀書有用嗎？</h3>
<p>— 方與嚴</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>「靑年只要讀書，讀書卽救國」，這是一般讀書至上論者的說法。</p>
<p>「靑年只要救國，不必讀書」，這是一般讀書無用論者的說法。</p>
<p>其實這兩種說法，都是一偏之見，都是不對的，「讀書卽救國」的讀書至上論者，即是引導靑年坐待亡國的亡國論者，我們必須負起淸除這種亡國論的毒素。「一殺國不必讀書」的讀書無用論者，卽是引導靑年走上盲行盲動盲幹的誤國論者，我們必須羣起，糾正這種錯誤的論調。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我們的主張，是用書，不是讀死書，死讀書，讀書死。書，是一種有用的工具——使人接受人類文化經驗，人人腦筋明白，思想正確。引導自己前進，引導大衆前進的工具。我們必須做什麼事用什麼書。爲解决問題而用書，爲創造事業面用靑，在現階段說，必須爲抗戰建國而用書。換句話說，書定我們的大助手和指導，它能够帮助指導我們對於每種問題，看得更明白，知道得吏正確，而得出更正確的解决；它能帮助和指導我們對於每一種事業，得到更多更好的方法，而能够精益求精的把所做的事所開創的事業做得更好些，更有進步的前途，更有光明的前途；它能帮助和指導我們對於抗戰建國的大計，知道得更詳細，把握得切實更正確，刖取得最後勝利的信念愈堅，使最後勝利更能够早日到來，因此，我們用的是：指導生活長進的書，指導創造事業的書，指導抗戰建國的書指導解决問題的書，實用得愈多，則生活愈有長進，解决問題愈有把握，創造事業愈有進步，抗戰建國更能够發生偉大的力量，以達到抗戰必勝，建國必成的目的。來，大家來用書，用有用的書，反對讀死書。反對贖無用的此書，大家在用有用之書上活躍起來！</p>

<p>因此，圖書館。是現代知識的寳庫，是指引現代青年立身修學處世的燈塔。是發動現代社會文化進步的大源泉，我們必須用全社會士女的力量來豐富這寳庫，光明這燈塔，增長增大這源泉，使之日加豐富，日加光明，日加增長增大，而成爲社會進化的一大動力。這當然是社會樂善士女所願增加培養的一大動力。</p>
<p>你能够買我們二毫的五毫的一張券，或一元，二元，五元的一張券，都是我們圖書館的助力，都是我們所歡迎所感謝。你們能捐贈我們—元二十元五十元百元以上的書籍，我們更所感謝與歡迎，當恭贈「名譽券」入座。捐贈書籍至百元以上者，當在圖書館題名，以留永久紀念。</p>
<p>我們全校師生作事的熱誠，作事的忠實與坦白，當爲社會士女所共見。而我們的作事能力與經驗都很有限，深望社會士女先進，不吝指敎，給予我們以更多更好的指導和贊助，那我們就榮幸萬分了。（本文爲中華業餘學校，舉行戲劇歌詠響欵大會，建立公開圖書館而作。）</p>
<h3>讀史偶得</h3>
<p>— 香菲</p>
<p>歷史上借外力平內亂的先例並不少，最著名的莫過於吳三桂的引淸兵入關。其動機雖然不過是「簡冠一怒爲紅顏」，但後世的人都不惜給他一頂「漢奸」帽子。</p>
<p>當李自成殺進北京，逼死宗幀，正是舉國囂囂的時候；淸人因緣時會、爲明帝后發喪，令臣民服喪三日，在當時也頗有人「感恩戴德」的吧。後來鳳陽總督馬土英擁戴福王由崧卽位於南京，史可法還受到淸將的一頓申斥：什麼「春秋之法：有賊不討，則新君不得書即位」。弄到史可法要從歷史上搬出中興史實來解目立之嫌；且還善爲辭說：「謹於八月，薄治筐篚，遣使犒師；兼欲請命鴻裁，連兵西討：是以王師旣發，復次江淮」。當時史可法並下願提「和平方案」，只以大義責之：「貴國驅除亂逆，兵以義動；若規此幅員，爲德不卒：是以義始而以利終，將爲賊人所竊笑」！</p>
<p>其實，說淸兵是「義師」，原是無可奈何：清兵的最後目的，在乎搶奪「國器」。所誚義師討賊，不過是一個幌子而已。史可法何嘗不明白？</p>
<p>難道歷史眞是循環的麼？到了現在，居然還有人想做吳三桂，「內蒙駐兵」，「共同防共」，又在師滿淸亡明的故智了。</p>
<p>現在國內根本就沒有李自成的「亂逆」，——隨便抓住一黨，拿來當做「亂逆」不是瞎了眼睛，便是別有心腸。×人頗熟悉中國歷史，知道要欺騙現代的「吳三桂」，非先造成「亂逆」的空氣不可。「共同防共呀」，不過是×人的詭辭，司奇怪的是：還居然有妄人去上钩！</p>
<p>吳三桂的請淸兵，是「衝冠一怒爲紅顏」。爲了呻醋而做漢奸，雖然可殺，但推究其動機，只是一時胡塗。現代的「吳三桂」呢？連牀頭的黃臉婆也出來給他策劃了。呻醋的理由不成立，那就只爲了「官癥」。</p>
<p>吳三桂不也是做過平西王的麼？結果，鬧了一場三藩之亂，不得善終——現代的「吳三桂」其鑒諸別要再做覆重鬼！</p>
<h3>言之成理</h3>
<p>— 子由</p>
<p>這理是人人會說，只要你的口才好點，道理便成篇。幼時上作文課，先生說：「各人的意見不同，只要文宇流利，能言之成理，便是佳作。」；後來在大學念書，敎授們也說：「學問無他，只要能自圓其說，便成一家言。」。細細想來，實在也是道理。要不然，光怪陸離的學說；議論，就不會存在。</p>
<p>伊里奇說過：「在極複雜的社會生活現象中，我們隨時都可以找得任何數量的例千或事實，以証實任何的論見」。証之抗戰以來的失敗論，速勝論，妥協論，及一切民族敗類的書籍和刊物，實在再好不過。</p>
<p>汪某的叛變黨國，妄發謬論，通×求降，已成定論。但自己戴着有色眼鏡，反看成人家有顏色的汪某私家報。却今天一個「我們的嚴重抗議」，明天一個「我們的立塲」，翻翻覆覆的替汪某辯護，這樣的一番大道理，也許在香港會有些人覺得他們「說來亦有道理」吧！漢奸理論常是「言之成理」，猶如包上糖衣的毒藥。我們要提高對漢奸理論的警惕性；經常的廣泛的，駁斥不正確的理論。</p>
<p>言之所以能够成理，當然和被惑者的認識不足有關，但主要的還是「言」在作怪。由於只求「言」之能成「理」，不顧事實；只言問題的一面，而不及其全面，這就是不正確理論的根源。但無論如何，它是逃不出現實先生的手掌。只要拿事實來對証，汪某的「忠誠謀國，光明磊洛，向政府公開建曦。」原來是陰謀叛國，向我們的民族×人公開乞憐，所謂「以國家民族之獨立生存，領土主權之獨立完整爲進行和議原則」，就是准許×人在我國自由居住，駐軍，把東北四省給了×人，把民族的生命線——經濟權放在×人的掌握；乾脆點購就是在亡國的條件下投降。放開了許多擊來擊去的游擊隊不談，專談一小部游來游去的「流寇」（大部份還是×人收買了的），當然只能得到游擊隊沒用的繆論，不談抗戰的進步，先在壞處兜圈子，抗戰當然是百害帶一利。可是善辯的先生，假如照尊意而行，事實上就是把中國拱手送本給日本。我們要的不是圓美的言語文字啦！</p>
<p>我想，不談道理則已，要談就得找出整個客觀形勢的發展和要點，抓住事實來說話。</p>
<h3>兩個時代的距離</h3>
<p>— 孟起</p>
<p>直到我學校畢業出來做事，爲此事曾問過父親一次，父親說：</p>
<p>「孩子們有孩子們應作的事，也有他們作不了的事。你作不了的事使你知曉而憂慮，這會躭擱了你應作的事。」</p>
<p>聽時還不解這幾句話的好處，到自己做了父親，才深深地領會了這幾句話準確地說明了爲人父的基本態度</p>
<p>我也不必諱飾，父親有很多的缺點。在思想和行動上，父規是屬於舊世界裏的人物。他的個人主義氣分很濃厚，個性又很强，對於兒子的訓練，一味地存着「類我類我」的想頭。由於敎育與時代感覺的不同，我和父親在想思上漸漸發生了許多裂痕。發生了不輕微的衝突，有一個時期，父親簡直連理都不理我，我心中也充滿了對父親的蔑視和恨憤，要不是仗着母親的眼淚潤顯着大家的感情，一時是很有决裂的可能的。恰巧，在家庭的低氣壓下，我有事到一個很偏遠的地方，別情和遺忘解鬆了我們間的糾紛。首先老人耐不住寂寞，寫了充滿情感的長信，這使我怨尤父親的心情一轉而爲對自己責備。以後我們間從沒有提過已往的一段事情，直到我在外面弁走幾年而又回家鄕的時候。這時大家已經平心靜氣，有一天，祇是把以往這一回事作「研究」資料似的談着。父親摯切地說：</p>
<p>「那一囘是我不對。我只看到自己的世界，沒有看到你的世界。我的世界已是陳舊的了，我雖不懂得你的世界是怎樣的，但覺得應該是以舊的就新的。……」</p>
<p>父親的爽朗和歡欣逼出了我悔疚的眼淚。</p>
<p>去年我有事到廣東去。父親興高烈采地帮我整理行裝，那時天氣很熱。父親身體肥大，動作實在費勁，母親勸他不要動手，他幾乎發怒起來，說只要是他歡喜做的事，儘熱些也不妨，母親沒有辦法，只有跟前跟後替他打扇。父親揮着黃豆般的汗珠，把我的衣服依着時序一件一件摺疊好，一面關照我那件衣服在底層，那件衣服在面上，在南方什麼時季適宜於穿着那幾套衣服。我那時只出神地凝視他額上的汗珠，他說的話，倒並不十分注意。一切部署定妥後，父親又堅持着要送我上船，他說我做事不精細，非要他親自照料不可——其實以前我「出門」已經有好幾囘。到了上海，因爲輪船誤期，經我再三勸吿，父親才答應先回家去。眞奇怪，我一向東奔西走很少在家，獨有這次，父親在瀕行之前，十分依依難捨，關於飲食起居等瑣事，叮囑了又可囑。快要上車的一刻，簡直是老淚縱橫，泣不可仰；要不是爲了「矜持」，我當時風想和他老人家熱烈地擁抱一下。（未完）</p>
<h3>文明和野蠻的分野</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>據一個日本的軍人誇口說，以中日兩國的兵士相比較，日本兵士的知識水準要遠比中國兵爲高。於是一位「銃後」文人馬上就來做文章，斷定中國是文化低的野蠻國，並引証了一位名人的話，說自古名將不出於野蠻人之間。而是出於文化人之間的。</p>
<p>接着爲表示他「文人」的「公正」態度起見，又說我們不能以否定野性的强健性，而証明文明人的强處。因爲古代歷史常有不少文明的國家，曾受過野蠻人的征服或威脅。如古代具有高度文明的波斯常受野蠻人的侵略。中國中原文化地帶的常受夷狄侵擾，甚至被幾度征服，而且因此斷定無產階級的企圖「征服」資產階級一，也不外出於文化水準較低的野性勝利妄想。</p>
<p>但野蠻和文明交戰的最後勝利，必然仍歸於文明，就連這位「後」文人也承認了的。據說古代斯巴達和雅典的搏鬥，就是最好的例宇。因斯巴達的武力雖强盛一時，結果，斯巴達究竟滅亡了，而雅典的文明，則至今日尙垂存于世。</p>
<p>若說今日的日本是「文明」的雅典，而中國乃是「野蠻」的斯巴達，不曉得這位「文人」有沒有勇氣承認？他提起筆來時雖想打別人的耳光，可是却每一次都打在自家的巴掌上！</p>
<p>侵略是野蠻的行爲，連希脫勒和莫索里尼都這樣說，我們的「銃後」文人，旣是柏林！羅馬軸心的支持者。自然不敢有所創新。其實一條早爲舉世公認的眞理，那怕你怎樣的狡猾，也是不便否認的。但侵略者的野心，决不會僅備因爲有這樣的眞理存在，便停止他的侵略的行動。于是便只好張冠李戴掉個槍花，硬說侵略者是被侵略者，而被侵略者倒是侵略者。這樣顚倒是非的戰略雖是消極的戰略，但畢竟因爲是「野蠻」的關係，再也想不出「文明』的戰略。</p>
<p>到今日還來爭論中日兩國誰是侵略者簡直是白痴說鬼話，聚世界文明國於一堂的國際聯盟，早已爲我們判定了誰是侵略者，全世界的與論也早一致把侵略者的眞面目揭露無遺，可是因爲「野蠻」的武器尙在侵略者的手裏，所以是非的定理雖分，我們却還得以自已的血和肉來證實這定理的眞實。</p>
<p>就常識觀的知識言，也許日本兵士的軍事技術知識要比中國强些，這是因爲日本有着這毬軍事技術設備，如果中國也有這種高度技術設備，那麼中國士乓的此方面知識，决不會輸於日本。至於就眞理觀的知識言，則日本兵士的「文化性」，在南京暴行及它處暴行上，表現得最明白不過了。再看一看Amejels　Veapa的一個間諜，更可曉得日本軍人口中的「文化性」和野蠻人的「默性」究竟有幾多區別。</p>
<p>名將出于文化人間，是不錯的，如現在中國的最高統帥及其僚屬，就是一例。至於目本在中日戰事十六個月來統帥更調，（現在又在大調動）足見他們的手忙脚亂。所謂「名將」的醜態，業已暴露無遺。像士肥原那樣的陰謀家，就是日本「名將」的典型，殘忍橫暴，貪狠，缺乏理性，這一切就是日本軍人的本性！</p>
<p>一個民族的文明和野蠻的分野，是决定在一民族的正義觀感及其實踐。對于此次中日戰爭的文明和野豐的分野，也同樣適用這一解釋，一切的歪曲和掩飾决逃不過眞理的照妖鏡。</p>

        <h1>1939.01.12</h1>
<h3>The Question of Revising the American Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>In his address to the 76th Congress, President Roosevelt, while advocating for democracy and criticizing dictatorship, also proposed revising the Neutrality Act. He said, "The Neutrality Act, in its current form, is sufficient to facilitate aggressor nations and disadvantage those who are being invaded, and must be revised." Indeed, the current American Neutrality Act, under the present international circumstances, is truly a redundant burden. It is insufficient to protect the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, and it passively encourages the atrocities of aggressors, causing its own legitimate interests to be repeatedly encroached upon. Recognizing this, the President has once again put forward the proposal for revision in this session of Congress. This is not only desired by those who are being invaded, but also a necessary measure to safeguard all the legitimate interests of the United States.</p>
<p>The current American Neutrality Act was formulated in 1935 and revised in 1937. In the autumn of 1935, when the Italian-Ethiopian War was about to break out, American isolationists, in order to prevent the United States from repeating the mistakes of 1917 and being drawn into the vortex of war, hastily passed this Neutrality Act in Congress. Its main points are: (1) When an international war breaks out, the United States should prohibit the transport of weapons and ammunition to belligerent countries; (2) Prohibit foreign ships from transporting such goods; (3) Prohibit American citizens from traveling on belligerent ships; (4) Crack down on belligerent submarines in American waters or territorial waters; (5) Restrict American ships from supplying belligerent warships from American ports. Such content has many drawbacks. In terms of the most significant ones, firstly, prohibiting the export of munitions to all belligerent countries, regardless of whether they are aggressors or being invaded, is tantamount to weakening the resistance of those who are being invaded, while passively encouraging the atrocities of aggressors. Secondly, the term "munitions" has a broad meaning, making implementation quite complicated. Thirdly, lending money to belligerent countries was the main reason why the United States was drawn into the vortex of war last time, but this is not regulated in the Neutrality Act. Therefore, this Neutrality Act cannot prevent the invasion of the United States by war.</p>
<p>In legal terms, an international war must go through the process of a declaration of war. Although the Italian-Ethiopian War did not go through the process of a declaration of war, it cannot be denied that it was an international war, so this law could still be applied reluctantly. However, now the world is changing, and things often happen unexpectedly. Following the Italian-Ethiopian War, there was the Spanish Civil War, which contained an international war within a civil war. Under this form of war, this law lost its effect. Therefore, the United States revised it in January 1937, prohibiting the shipment of munitions to both sides of the conflict in Spain, on the grounds that the war in Spain was sufficient to spread beyond the borders of Spain. Furthermore, the Japanese invasion of China, which began on July 7, 1937, was also an undeclared war. Although the American government did not implement the Neutrality Act because the two countries, China and Japan, had not formally declared war, Wall Street financial giants violated the wishes of the majority of the American people, undermined the traditional American policy in the Far East, and subsidized the Japanese invasion. As a result, it increased Japan's ambition to monopolize China and seized American interests in China.</p>
<p>American politicians with foresight have long been calling loudly, pointing out that the American government must adopt effective methods to stop the atrocities of aggressors. President Roosevelt's request to revise the Neutrality Act is a preliminary way to sanction aggressors.</p>
<p>The floods of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans can no longer withstand the atrocities of aggressors. It is impossible for American isolationists to want to stay out of all wars. Only by actively taking effective methods to stop aggressors can world peace be maintained and their own legitimate interests be preserved. Now that Congress has just begun, we deeply hope that both the Senate and the House of Representatives can accept the President's opinion, thoroughly revise the Neutrality Act, eliminate all elements that are unfavorable to those who are being invaded and favorable to aggressors, and more actively proceed to stop the atrocities of aggressors! (Editor's note: Regarding future Sino-American relations and the general trend of the Pacific, there is another interview in this newspaper with a well-known Chinese diplomat, see page 3 of today's newspaper, please pay attention.)</p>
<h3>The So-Called "Three Principles" and "New Order"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiahua</p>
<p>On the eve of Japan's imminent launch of a large-scale war of aggression against China, its Prime Minister Hirota, in a speech to the parliament, put forward the so-called "Three Principles" toward China, namely: (1) Recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria; (2) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation; (3) Joint anti-communism. Later, Ambassador Arita came to Nanjing with these principles. No matter how much he threatened and intimidated, China remained unmoved. Because China not only had to firmly defend its own position and maintain the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, but also could not accommodate the arrogant demands of the aggressors, so as not to affect the status of friendly countries and hinder the rational progress of East Asia.</p>
<p>Everyone should not forget that before Hirota's speech, on April 17, 1934, the Director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eiji Amau, issued a statement: (1) Japan has a special relationship with China, so its attitude toward China is different from that of other countries; (2) In order to maintain stability in East Asia, Japan has no choice but to take independent action toward China; (3) Japan opposes China's use of the power of other countries to resist any actions by Japan; (4) Japan resolutely opposes any foreign country that gives China technical or financial assistance and forms a "co-management situation." If we compare the "Amau Statement" with the "Three Principles," what is very striking is that Japan wants to reduce China to its protectorate, while at the same time wanting to eliminate all the rights and advantages of other countries in East Asia.</p>
<p>The eight months of China's heroic resistance has shouldered two missions: defending the country and safeguarding human justice. China is unswervingly committed to this. China has discerned Japan's conspiracy without any doubt, no matter how the Japanese warlords or their spokespersons try to cover it up. China is not confused by it at all. It is precisely because of this that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statement on December 22, that he wants to establish a "New Order in East Asia"—"The so-called New Order in East Asia means close contact and mutual assistance in politics, economy, and culture among Japan, 'Manchukuo,' and China to prevent the Red Peril, uphold Oriental civilization, and remove economic barriers, so that China can break away from its semi-colonial status in order to achieve stability in East Asia"—this kind of self-deceiving old tune is commonplace, and the Chinese people are not surprised by it. This is nothing more than a repeated explanation of the "Three Principles" and the "Amau Statement," and is only part of the interpretation of Tanaka's Positive Policy for Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>What is surprising is that after Tanaka's Positive Policy for Manchuria and Mongolia was announced, some friendly people were even dubious, thinking that Japan's aggression plan was not so extensive. However, as the facts have gradually evolved to this day, the ferocious face of the Japanese warlords has been fully revealed. It cannot be denied that Japan wants to destroy China, and Japan especially wants to dominate East Asia.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, as Chu Chung-tsou said in his memorial to the throne: "To conquer the whole world, one must first conquer China." Conquering China is merely the means by which Japanese warlords launch attacks on the whole world. And now they have begun to challenge Western countries.</p>
<p>Japan has excluded the rights and interests obtained by friendly countries through treaties in the occupied areas of China, and at the same time has repeatedly stated that "Open Door" no longer applies and the Nine-Power Treaty should be revised. As for the protests from the United States, it deliberately equivocates and does not give a direct reply. Its contempt for everything is obvious and needs no speculation.</p>
<p>Aggression is rampant, and no one is spared. China has realized this, so it does not hesitate to fight alone. Friendly countries have also realized this now. Even if it is a little late, it is still not too late. Therefore, the beginning of the parallel actions of Britain and the United States has made Japan anxious. If we want to achieve the actual effect of sanctions, it will not be effective if we do not strike them in time. In the past, we have allowed Japan to grow in power. From now on, we should not have a moment of appeasement. Otherwise, everything will be destroyed, and there will be no way to repent. As China enters a new stage of intensified resistance against aggression, let us offer this intention of mutual encouragement to our friendly people.</p>
<h3>The Largest Salt Field in Sichuan - Zigong in the Tide of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Wu Xue</p>
<p>Sichuan has twenty-six salt fields. Zigong is the largest salt producing area in the entire province. It began to prosper after the Taiping Rebellion. At first, water buffaloes were used to push brine (incubate water), but now it has progressed to using machines to push brine. The East and West fields have a total of eight or seventy machine-driven wells. When approaching Zigong, you can see the towering derricks of the Lianggao Mountain tombs in the distance, with smoke filling the sky and the sound of machines roaring. This already has the appearance of a large factory. Compared with the Wutongqiao salt field, which is still in the stage of primitive industry, it has made great progress. Here, salt is burned by using the earth's core gas. The salt wells here produce fire after the water is pushed out. Some wells produce fire (gas) at the same time as water, but the water in the wells that produce fire is less salty and has less salt content. The gas fire is extremely beautiful. It is led out of the ground through pipes, and when it is lit, it burns with a flame like alcohol. The heat is very high. A tongue of flame that looks only a foot long can burn four or five hundred catties of salt in a day and night. At most, one well can produce eight or nine hundred heads of water, which can burn eight or nine hundred pots.</p>
<p>I had been to Zigong three years ago. At that time, transportation was not as convenient as it is now. The roads from Jingnei (Neijiang to Zigong) and from Zigong to Weiyuan, Rongxian, and Dengjingguan were only completed in the last year or two. The salt producing area here is divided into East and West fields. In the East field (Zigong), the salt area south of the Dafengbao Lianggao is the most abundant. In the West field (Gongjing), the areas of Changtu Aiye Nanshanzizui are the most abundant. Zigong is more than ten miles away from Gongjing, and there is a highway where cars can travel at night. It is said that Zigong City will be officially established on New Year's Day next year, and a municipal preparatory office has already been established.</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, the reed salt has been invaded, and the two Huai areas have fallen. Zigong's position in the salt industry has become even more important. Many industrialists from other provinces want to invest and develop here, such as Fan Xudong's Jiuda Refined Salt Company's relocation to Sichuan. A large-scale refined incubation plant has already been established in Zigong.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to meet the requirements of the War of Resistance and the needs of the rear, production must be greatly increased. Since September of last year, production has increased from approximately 280,158.41 dan (approximately) per month to approximately 427,717.07 dan (approximately) per month. This is indeed a small help to the country's harvest. However, after the retreat from Wuhan, the sales market on the Chu shore (Hubei) has been somewhat affected. Therefore, under the large-scale increase in production, they are now greatly feeling the distress of sales channels.</p>
<p>Zigong is not a very large city. There is only one bustling street. Originally, it was only a township. However, it has all the conditions of a city. There are banks, hotels, bathhouses, theaters, beautiful barbershops, and also debauchery and luxury. There is a Sichuan opera house, where tickets cost five jiao and are often sold out. New plays such as Nanhua Hall's "Legend of the White Snake" are often performed. Some ladies need to see Tian's "Spring Thoughts" and the boat scene of the White Snake Fairy in "Legend of the White Snake." The War of Resistance does not seem to have much to do with them.</p>
<h3>The Views of Foreign Correspondents on the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Shengzhi</p>
<p>Since the second phase of our continued resistance, the Japanese have deeply felt their national power gradually declining. If they do not seek an armistice soon, they will be unable to extricate themselves. Consequently, they are running around everywhere clamoring for peace. Recently, the Japanese authorities, seeking instruction from foreign "China expert" journalists, specially convened a so-called "International Correspondents' Field Symposium" at the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai last winter. Those invited to the meeting included people from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland, and other countries. The Japanese originally hoped to obtain praise for their military achievements from the mouths of foreign reporters, but unexpectedly they were severely criticized by the reporters from various countries, greatly embarrassing them. Even the German reporters, their fellow sufferers, found it difficult to defend Japan's actions. This shows that justice resides in the hearts of the people, and righteousness will not be extinguished by the deception of aggressors. The original article was published in the December issue of "Chuo Koron," and is specially translated here for the enjoyment of our readers. --Translator</p>
<p>Japanese Reporter, Special Correspondent of Chuo Koron, Koichi Komorita (hereinafter referred to as Komorita): Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedules to come here today. Due to the fall of Wuhan, the situation of the Sino-Japanese War has entered a new stage. On this occasion, I sincerely hope that foreign correspondents can express some fair opinions from an "objective perspective" on the current issues and future prospects of the Sino-Japanese Incident as much as possible. Mr. Steuck is here, having just arrived from Wuhan not long after its fall, I wonder what insights you have on the Sino-Japanese Incident?</p>
<p>Mr. Steuck, Hankou Special Correspondent for the German People's Observer (hereinafter referred to as Steuck): How long the fourth phase of resistance of the Chinese side can continue is another question. In fact, the resistance is still proceeding according to the established policy, and it is not impossible to continue it. At the second meeting of the National Political Council held in Chongqing shortly after the fall of Wuhan, Chiang Kai-shek stated in his report that the Chinese army should induce the Japanese army to penetrate deep into the western provinces and implement a decisive battle when it occupies geographically superior conditions. Whether this strategy is appropriate is a question. However, I believe that the Chinese army can satisfactorily achieve the goal of attrition warfare by inducing the Japanese army to penetrate deep into the interior. Although the Japanese army's heavy artillery and other modern equipment have exerted considerable power, if they penetrate deep into the mountainous areas of the interior, not only will heavy artillery and new mechanized units be useless, but also the attacks of large warships on the Chinese formations will be impossible. They (Note: referring to our authorities) believe that once the Japanese army penetrates inland, the equipment of the Chinese and Japanese armies will be largely the same, except for airplanes. Moreover, the Chinese side not only has an overwhelming abundance of human resources that can be used for combat, but also attempts to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army with a comprehensive guerrilla warfare. Currently, on the surface, China relies heavily on Soviet aid, but Chiang Kai-shek may not want 100% cooperation with the Soviet Union in his heart. As for the Communist Party, figures such as Zhou Enlai are more realistic than some of the key figures of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Komorita: Please Mr. Woodhead, comment on the whereabouts of the Chinese government after the fall of Guangdong and Wuhan.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodhead, Editor of the British Oriental Times (hereinafter referred to as Woodhead): The successive loss of the four major cities of Guangzhou, Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang in a matter of days is indeed a major blow to Chiang Kai-shek, but to this day, it cannot be proven to be a fatal blow. China has not doubted its strength to resist Japan; Chiang also retains the trust and support of the people. Needless to say, the scope actually covered by the "Chiang regime" has shrunk, and it is currently isolated due to the interruption of foreign transportation, and the transportation agencies are also very weak. However, this cannot be said to be a "sign of the collapse of the Chiang regime." No, he cannot tolerate unconditional peace, and there is a reason for that. We should say that in the places Chiang Kai-shek has lost, not only his prestige but also the area where his power still reaches.</p>
<p>What changes will happen in the near future, there is no time to elaborate now. Assuming that the National Government is truly weak, I think the first thing that must happen is signs of a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. That is, the Communist Party moves to the northwest, relying on the Soviet Union as the only supplier of military supplies and continues to resist Japan; on the one hand, Chiang and his party take Guizhou or Guangxi as their base, and maintain contact with the outside world through Yunnan, and still resist Japan to the end.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's decision not to take Chiang as the opponent at all, is nothing more than intending to point to Chiang's defeat, but in fact makes peace negotiations difficult. Most foreigners doubt whether this decision is a good strategy. Removing Chiang is by no means the demand of the Chinese people, but rather strengthens unity with Chiang as the center. At this time or in the near future, if Chiang resigns, the political chaos will undoubtedly be worse than it is now. It is naturally not a policy unique to Japan to propose a specific person as the target of the enemy. Kaiser during the European War was like this, and recently Hitler also adopted a similar tactic towards Czech President Benes. However, this tactic must be premised on the fact that a certain individual has more power and power than he actually has. In the event that Chiang resigns, China's anti-Japanese front may not collapse, nor will the National Government necessarily fall.</p>
<p>Komorita: What does Mr. Hoster think about the same issue?</p>
<p>Mr. Hoster, Deputy Editor of the British North China Daily News (hereinafter referred to as Hoster): Although they believe that the "Chiang regime" has become a local regime, in the eyes of independent foreign observers, this may not be the case. The "Chiang regime" is still retreating militarily, and the continuous loss of economic centers is a fact, and it is also a fact that the area where Chiang now has military power, financial resources, and general national support is shrinking, but his back is still supported by the high tide of national anti-Japanese sentiment. Financially, it is consolidated beyond expectations by donations from overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese all believe that the current Chiang regime is the only government that presents the defense of China's sovereignty and establishment. Because overseas Chinese trust government officials - such as Chiang Kai-shek - they will undoubtedly continue to provide spiritual and financial assistance. There are many rich overseas Chinese, and they certainly interpret Japan's continental movement in the worst possible way.</p>
<p>It is said that the Chiang regime is receiving assistance from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries, but it is more certain that the assistance from any country is not as powerful as that from overseas Chinese. It is also a fact that these facts cannot be ignored in the decision of Chiang's future policies.</p>
<p>But under what circumstances is it easiest to cut off the assistance of overseas Chinese? First, when Chiang yields to Japan. When he is considered a weakling; second, when he is too radically left-leaning and enters into an open alliance with the Communist Party and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Komorita: What about the Chinese national movement after the outbreak of the war?</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Rand, Chief Writer of the American Shanghai Evening Post (hereinafter referred to as Gould): Regarding the strengthening of Chinese nationalism, no other external force is as effective as Japan's war against China. Since the revolutionary period of 1926-27, the Chinese people have begun to unify the regime to resist warlord politics, and it has been strengthened.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the Japanese have made a big mistake in their view of the degree of development of the Chinese national spirit. The Japanese always think that the character of the Chinese is individualistic, not based on the interests of the country and the nation, but focusing on one family and one clan, that is, a nation that cannot regard the country as a family. Perhaps the Kuomintang has made many mistakes, but the fact that it is actually more progressive than the old warlord politics has not been recognized by most Japanese people, who think that China is still a country dominated by warlords. This misunderstanding really cannot help the mutual understanding between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Many people know the fact that China has been in a state of military chaos for many years, but at the same time, they ignore the fact that the Chinese themselves are working hard to improve this state and are progressing well. I believe that in the process of national rejuvenation, not only Japan, but also Britain, the United States, and other powers, have a tendency to exclude foreign oppression, and China is no exception. The majority of Chinese people have not only strengthened the national movement because of this war, but also have a strong tendency to the left. If the war continues in the future, there is no doubt that a major trend will occur in China's future.</p>
<p>Komorita: What position do the Chinese intellectuals take now?</p>
<p>Gould: What position do the Chinese intellectuals take now? This is no longer a question. (Omission) They are now in a period of national crisis, and they only have one hope. I think this is something that the Japanese rarely understand. The divergence of political understanding between China and Japan can only be resolved on the basis of justice. If Japan, as in the current military situation, wants to win everything by force, and wants to seize China with the blood of life, it can be said that the Chinese intellectuals will devote all their strength to communism. This has become an inevitable trend. If the Japanese intellectuals stood in the position of today's Chinese intellectuals, would they be able to take a different attitude?</p>
<p>Komorita: Isn't this a declaration of the Communist Party's ambition after the fall of Wuhan?</p>
<p>Mr. Cumming, Representative of the German Press: The best breeding ground for the Communist Party's thoughts and actions is a chaotic era. The current Chinese army is mostly guerrillaized. The Chinese Communist Party takes advantage of this opportunity to instill communist ideas, teach red tactics, and popularize them among the general public as much as possible. This sign has begun to develop. The Communist Party has already taken command of some of the guerrilla forces. The aspirations and determination of the guerrillas are also influenced by this Communist Party central organization. In the future, it will undoubtedly be completely subordinate to the so-called Red Army headquarters in Shaanxi. Even in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, new bases of the Chinese Communist Party have been secretly established, starting to win over the people in the rear. However, whether the strength of these Chinese Red Army and the Communist Party will expand and strengthen from now on is difficult to answer affirmatively. Whether it succeeds or not depends on the attitude of the local people on the one hand, and on the political and military capabilities of the response on the other hand. Chinese farmers, if they are not given a strong organizational force from behind, will never rise up automatically to resist the red forces.</p>
<p>I think the only way to prevent the spread of this chaotic state and to prevent the expansion of the Red Army and the Communist Party is to stop the hostile acts as soon as possible and seek a just solution between the two major nations of East Asia.</p>
<p>(A section on economic issues is omitted. Translator)</p>
<p>Komorita: Finally, standing in a third party position, what kind of expectations do you have for China and Japan for the restoration of "East Asian Peace"?</p>
<p>Mr. Ivant, Acting Editor of the British "Finance and Commerce" magazine: How to achieve lasting peace between China and Japan? This is the most important issue. I have been traveling between China and Japan since 1905, and I have very good feelings for the people of both countries. I believe that China and Japan should coexist and prosper with the most friendly attitude, and I think this is not impossible. The fault cannot be pointed to any one party alone. There is no room now to detail the Sino-Japanese relationship, nor to mention the past state and the problems that are considered in the future.</p>
<p>I think permanent peace can only be obtained as a gift of cooperation. This kind of cooperation is not born, not from friendly understanding, nor from force, oppression, or obedience. "Cooperation" means to work together automatically towards a common goal.</p>
<p>What I will never forget after living in the Far East for many years is the real cooperation between China and Japan about thirty years ago. At that time, Chinese entrepreneurs, especially tobacco manufacturers and printing operators, recruited Japanese technical consultants, allowing Japanese investment. Groups of Chinese youths with lofty aspirations went to study in Japan, and Sino-Japanese cooperation was progressing naturally and invisibly. We saw such a situation with our own eyes thirty years ago. Later, the Chinese National Revolution occurred, followed by the World War. At that time, Japan's actions, as I saw them, had reached the end of Sino-Japanese cooperation and entered the era of rule. China's so-called anti-Japanese sentiment also occurred at this time. You should know that the issue of the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, which encountered the most severe damage to Sino-Japanese relations, has not had the opportunity to be adjusted. Although the greatest efforts were made at that time, trying to use diplomatic means to improve the cracks in Sino-Japanese relations. However, the results were hindered by people who did not believe in anything but force, and tended to fail.</p>
<p>Konoe, Kawagoe, Arita, the late Yoshi, Honda Tai Taro, Sato Naotake, Yuki Toyoiro, Yoshida Seiji, Enda, Ozaki Yukio and other people issued warnings long before the outbreak of the current incident, emphasizing the re-understanding of China; however, "double diplomacy" brought very unfortunate results. China's anti-Japanese sentiment became more popular and激ran due to Japan's attitude. At the translation meeting in February 1937, Ozaki gave a speech saying: "If Japan really wants China's friendship, it should frankly express it."</p>
<p>If you ask me how to establish a permanent peace between China and Japan, my answer is to first ask Japan to implement the advice of the above-mentioned leaders. There is no reason for China and Japan to abandon each other. Neighboring comrades with many common points should of course have friendly relations. I think this must also be the hope of the majority of the people. However, who is hindering the close relationship between these two countries? Why has China's anti-Japanese sentiment been at its highest in the past few years, especially since 1931? First, we must see the cause of the friction, remove the cause of the friction, and then we can wait for the arrival of permanent peace. If the Japanese government can accommodate the advice of the enlightened people and work hard in the best direction, I believe that the Chinese side will definitely repay her with a real agreement.</p>
<p>Komorita: What is Mr. Hoster's opinion?</p>
<p>Hoster: Achieving peace in the Far East by force may be possible in these few years. Historical proof shows that peace based on the concept of terror is not permanent. After a thorough whipping, China may yield temporarily, but Japan cannot make the Chinese forget that their "rice bowl has been broken." (Omission) The ideal of Greater East Asia has been shattered by recent events. Many observers have seen: "East Asia for East Asians" This slogan can no longer be applied to the Chinese, because the Chinese are suffering from the aggression and slaughter of fellow East Asians. Standing in China's position, I am afraid that the first slogan to be shouted is "China for the Chinese!"</p>
<p>Komorita: You don't seem to understand the true meaning of the "holy war." What is Mr. Gould's opinion?</p>
<p>Gould: No matter in the Far East or anywhere else, permanent peace cannot be obtained except for the peace of justice. Of course, the idea of the word justice varies from country to country, but the facts are the same. For example, the Japanese think that they have adopted a fair attitude towards China, but the Chinese do not think it is fair. The only way to solve this correctness is to exchange positions, think from the other side's perspective, and reflect on whether "do not do to others what you do not want to be done to yourself." In my opinion, Japan imagines the challenges and attacks from China and other countries too much; on the contrary, it does not recognize that seizing the territory of other countries and destroying other countries, even if it is peace, will not be permanent peace. Although Japan has stated that it is ready for peace, it is questionable whether the power of the military can agree to and implement the covenant. Japan may think that the great powers are doing their best to support China, but the fact is not necessarily so. I think what the great powers hope for China is that China can become a free and independent country, and can open its doors and allow the great powers to trade in notice. What the great powers are uneasy about is Japan's monopoly of China's industries, resources, and markets, and excluding its trade with China and its trade in China. I have heard many responsible and high-ranking Japanese say that this is just the worry of the Chinese and foreigners, and I hope that the uneasiness of the border is a worry, so we dare to look forward to the arrival of real peace. But the matter (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Japanese Plot in the Northwest Becomes More Urgent, Japanese Troops in Northern Shanxi Increase Sharply, Conspiring to Exploit Complex Ethnic Relations, Risking a Lone Army to Invade Shaanxi and Gansu</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 11th] The Japanese attempt to invade the Northwest is becoming more active. In the northern Shanxi area, the transport of Japanese troops is endless. Judging from the situation, they plan to invade Hequ and Pianguan, risking a lone army to invade Shaanxi and Gansu, and also plan to exploit the complex ethnic relations in the Northwest to achieve a successful gamble. We have already seen through the Japanese intentions and are making strict preparations.</p>
<p>[Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 10th] (Late) According to reliable information from the front, after our army withdrew from Guaji County on the same day, it relied on the new tactics and strategies of "He hits west, I hit east," and separately detoured, flanked, and surrounded the Japanese, so the Japanese were never able to settle in Guaji County. Our army took the opportunity to counterattack and indeed recaptured the county seat after a fierce street battle on the evening of the 8th. Another part of our army counterattacked Daning, responding to the counterattack on Guaji County, and also completely recaptured the county on the evening of the 7th and the morning of the 8th, and then took advantage of the situation to advance towards Xiangning and Puxian. The Japanese army abandoned the city and fled upon hearing the news, and our army is still pursuing them in victory. This is the recent victory of our army in Shanxi Province.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in a Certain Area of Shandong Province on the 11th] For days, Japanese reinforcements have been arriving from their home country and South China. Their purpose is either to conduct a large-scale "suppression" of the guerrillas in Shandong Province, or to resume the offensive to the west, in order to occupy the un-occupied part of the Longhai Railway, and then invade Xi'an to cut off the Sino-Soviet transportation line. At the same time, the Japanese also plan to invade Tongguan from southern Shanxi, and have been continuously shelling across the river from the Fenglingdu area for days, as if waiting to be ready to invade Shaanxi in two directions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in a Certain Area of Shandong Province on the 11th] According to a telegram from Qingdao, since the 1st of this month until now, a total of fifteen transport ships have arrived in the port from Japan, carrying at least 6,000 Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Shipped to Shanghai, Taiwanese Sugar Imports Increase Tenfold</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 11th] A certain Japanese newspaper here claimed that the import of Taiwanese goods into Shanghai has been increasing continuously. Some goods are similar to those made in foreign countries. An investigation shows that Taiwan's imports in 1937 were only 5,000 tons, but last year they reached 50,000 tons, ranking first among all imports and threatening the controlled market. It is said that Taiwanese sugar has lower costs and is easier to import, making it a strong rival to Java's exports. It is also said that Taiwanese fruits and vegetables now have a large export prospect and will be able to occupy the position of Singapore's products. Osaka Shosen Kaisha is reportedly planning to increase passenger and cargo traffic between Shanghai and Taiwan to make it easier for products from both places to be imported.</p>

<h3>US Ambassador Discusses Construction of Chongqing-Burma Road in England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Before returning to the United States on the liner "France," US Ambassador to China, Johnson, had a frank discussion with our reporter about the Chongqing-Burma Road. He stated that it only takes twelve days to travel from [China] to Burma. The driving time is short, the road surface is excellent, and the gradient is not steep. It can accommodate two cars traveling side by side, and it is currently being widened. Some sections of the road surface were washed away by mountain floods and are being urgently repaired, making them more solid than before. All wooden bridges have now been replaced with stone bridges. According to the US Ambassador, the road can already supply the necessary transport. When this road was built, 150,000 laborers were used, making the greatest possible use of local materials and animal power. The US Ambassador and his military staff had to bring their own camp beds during their travels, but European-style guest houses are gradually being added along the way. All road signs have been installed. The US Ambassador traveled from Rangoon to Magha by Imperial Airways plane and then came to England. He did not talk much about political issues, but expressed surprise at Wang Jingwei's peace movement, because when he was in Chongqing, he did not perceive this trend at all.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations; We Will Receive Much Soviet Assistance After the War; The Soviet Union May Intervene in the War</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan and current Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, today made a statement regarding Sino-Soviet relations, saying that Soviet troops may intervene in the Sino-Japanese War under three circumstances: first, if the League of Nations implements unanimous sanctions against Japan; second, if Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union can reach a compromise; and third, if Soviet territory is invaded by the Japanese army. He also said that although the Soviet Union has not yet been able to display its military power in the Far East, China has received much moral and material assistance from the Soviet Union in the eighteen months since the start of the war of resistance. Sino-Soviet relations are becoming closer.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council to Hold Meeting Soon to Discuss Sino-Japanese Dispute; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables Instructions to Representatives; Puppet Regime Denies Anglo-American Loans to China</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Chongqing, 11th] The League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet on the 15th of this month. It is reported that the appeal we submitted regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute has been included in the main agenda of this session. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cabled our government's policy to Representative Gu and others, instructing them to report to the Council when the time comes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 11th] Today, the Provisional Government issued a communiqué stating that the puppet Provisional Government refuses to bear any responsibility for previous Anglo-American loans to the Nationalist Government.</p>
<p>Britain Takes Active Measures to Protect Interests in China</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The British government is preparing to take active measures in the near future to protect British trade and aid China. British newspapers are widely reporting on this news. The "Birmingham Post" stated that "The British government will announce measures to protect British interests in the Far East after Parliament reconvenes." Informed sources believe that this move is highly likely in practice. The "Financial News" stated that the government is currently seriously considering two actions: one is to directly provide financial assistance to the Chinese government, and the other is to take various steps to directly strike at Japanese trade and finance. However, the newspaper learned that part of the difficulty in Britain's adoption of commercial retaliation lies in the opposition of certain interested parties in the autonomous regions, because they have huge interests in trading metals and wool with Japan. It has also been learned that the United States cannot take commercial retaliation against Japan because of the interests of maintaining the trade of gasoline, cotton, scrap iron, and machinery. However, the British government's attitude is becoming increasingly tough and knows that diplomatic protests will be fruitless. This is undoubtedly the case. Legally, Japan cannot prevent Britain from assisting China. However, in view of the fact that Britain wants to directly protect its interests in the Far East, it is believed that the British government will issue Japan a note identical to the one issued by the United States to Japan on December 31st of last year. This is the last protest before Britain takes truly severe measures.</p>
<p>US Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees Discuss Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 11th] US Ambassador to China, Johnson, arrived here yesterday. Although he claims it is entirely a private trip, the government believes he is related to the Anglo-American economic sanctions against Japan. It is reported that before going to the United States, he will meet with business leaders involved in trade with China, and if possible, he will also exchange views with political figures. Upon his return to the United States, the US Ambassador will report on the situation in the Far East to the US President.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees are scheduled to hold separate meetings in the coming days to discuss economic sanctions and amendments to the Neutrality Act. Regarding the former, some members of Congress are now advocating economic sanctions against Japan. Democratic Senator Pittman is one of them, declaring that "If there is someone who can be forced to respect your rights by means of starvation, why must you necessarily execute him?" Republican Senator Borah expressed his opposition, saying, "Economic sanctions are by no means a peaceful measure, but a preliminary step to war. If I am not prepared to fight, I do not want to implement sanctions." Which faction's position will prevail will be revealed when the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees begin their discussions.</p>
<h3>Military, Political, and Diplomatic Developments Before the Outbreak of the Second Stage of the War; Completion of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Scheduled Within Nine Years; Relations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Now Increasingly Harmonious</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Chongqing] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that the war of resistance against Japan has entered its second stage, from the Marco Polo Bridge Incident to the fall of Huangzhou and the abandonment of Wuhan, which was the first stage of the war. Although the fighting on all fronts is currently quiet, our various military units are all engaged in replenishment and preparation, transferring troops and generals. The second stage of the war is about to begin. At this critical juncture, the situation in various aspects is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Current Situation: Recently, the situation in the Sino-Japanese War has converged from all fronts into two major centers: South China and the Northwest. In South China, the Japanese army occupies Guangzhou, blocking transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, in order to cut off our foreign aid. They are also attempting to invade Guangxi along the West River and attempt to land at Beihai, going straight to Nanning and Longzhou, seizing Zhennanguan, and cutting off our border transportation to achieve their blockade purpose. In total, the Japanese army now has a strength of 240,000 troops in the Southwest. The Japanese claim to have 300,000 troops. However, due to strategic considerations, the Japanese army is eager to engage our army in a major decisive battle in South China, in order to avoid being heavily surrounded. Recently, Ando, the Japanese commander in South China, broadcast a challenge to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Our army was unmoved and continued to steadily advance along all lines according to the original strategy, avoiding a direct conflict with the Japanese army, and gradually pushing forward, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop and prolong the duration of the war to wear down the Japanese army. However, a major war in South China will be inevitable in the short term. The Japanese army will be driven out of Guangdong and Guangxi. As for the Northwest, the Japanese army's original plan was to invade with a large force during the winter when the Yellow River froze, attacking Xi'an and reaching Lanzhou to cut off the international route from China to the Soviet Union. In total, the Japanese army concentrated 160,000 troops in various strongholds in the Northwest. However, before the Japanese army launches a large-scale offensive in the Northwest, it must first eliminate the guerrilla forces in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, in order to avoid being threatened and endangering their retreat. Therefore, five divisions were surrounded by guerrilla forces in Shanxi, and their military function was almost annihilated by our army. Although the Yellow River has frozen, the Japanese army has not dared to rashly invade the Northwest due to various reasons. As for Central China, the Japanese army has found progress difficult, and their forces have been frequently transferred. The Japanese army is actively working to recover Wuhan.</p>
<p>Military Deployment: After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek held a military conference in Nanyue, he made new decisions on the overall strategy in Chongqing. In order to facilitate the issuing of orders, the Military Affairs Commission was moved to Chongqing to oversee the military affairs of the South China and Northwest theaters of war. A Southwest Headquarters was established in Guilin, with Bai Chongxi appointed as director, responsible for all military affairs in South China. [To be continued]</p>
<h3>Famous Diplomat Returns Home From the United States; Discusses the Situation in the Pacific; Makes Important Revelations About Sino-US Relations; Criticizes Advocates of Peace for Betraying the Nation Based on the International Situation</h3>
<p>(Exclusive Interview by Our Newspaper) A certain famous Chinese diplomat recently returned home from the United States. Our reporter made a special visit to his residence in Hong Kong to inquire about Sino-US relations and the situation in the Pacific. He provided the following remarks:</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the August 13th Sino-Japanese War, US government officials, from President Roosevelt downwards, have expressed sympathy for us. However, American public opinion mostly believes that while deep sympathy is permissible on a moral level, they still oppose sanctions against Japan in terms of action. The only exceptions are a segment of the intellectual class and the labor class, as they have advocated a tough stance against Japan from the beginning.</p>
<p>The relationship between the labor class and the capitalist class is like that between sedan carriers and the person sitting in the sedan. Even if the sedan carriers strongly want to take a certain route, they are powerless if the person in the sedan does not agree. Now, even the person in the sedan is starting to adopt a tough attitude, for two major reasons: (1) American commerce in China has been almost completely squeezed out by Japan. American merchants in China have never dared to criticize Japan, but now they have to explicitly demand government assistance in the name of the Chamber of Commerce. We must know that many of the American merchants in China are agents of large companies in their home country, and therefore have great influence domestically. (2) Since Japan began its war against China, it has drained no less than three-quarters of its cash reserves. Therefore, American merchants believe that Japan is no longer a prime customer, and they might as well be a little tougher. The reason they still have some reservations is that Japan still has some surplus gold reserves, and they cannot help but "play along."</p>
<p>The United States is a democratic country, not a dictatorship. Before the US President makes a major policy decision, he must first examine the support or opposition of public opinion. But while the US President does not have the power to force public opinion, he does have the power to influence it. Roosevelt's "Quarantine" speech in Chicago was a tool to test domestic public opinion. (His advocacy of convening a nine-nation conference in Beijing was a tool to test international public opinion.) He then realized that about seven out of ten people opposed it, so he did not dare to act rashly. However, he still sent two battleships, taking advantage of their trip to Australia to participate in a ceremony, to Singapore, the British naval base in the Far East, implicitly indicating the possibility of Anglo-American naval cooperation, giving Japan a significant jolt. But at that time, American opinion still largely expressed opposition, but there was no such intense reaction as after the "Quarantine" speech was delivered.</p>
<p>As a result of Japan's atrocities against China and its monopolization of commerce in China, American public opinion gradually supported the government, which became a fact. During this period of evolution of public opinion, if a major incident suddenly occurred in US-Japan relations, such as the bombing of the Panay, it could easily trigger a serious conflict, even war. I still remember that after the news of the bombing of the Panay reached the United States, American public sentiment was extremely high, and the government was determined to fight at all costs. If the Japanese government had not quickly apologized and acknowledged compensation, war would have been unavoidable.</p>
<p>Speaking of the international situation in the Pacific, there is one important key, which is Anglo-American cooperation. In my observation, the relationship between Britain and the United States will become even closer in the future. First, the Anglo-American commercial treaty has been signed, and economic relations have greatly improved. Second, the war debt problem will inevitably be resolved soon. It can be asserted that previously, Britain and the United States were unwilling to initiate anything regarding the Far East war, preferring to observe the situation and act when the opportunity arose. Now there has been a change, that is, the two countries are adopting parallel policies, working hand in hand, and will never shirk responsibility from each other. This can already be seen from the recent Anglo-American loans to China. As for naval cooperation between the two countries, it is even more believable. Generally speaking, the defense line undertaken by the British navy in the Pacific starts from Singapore, goes southeast through Australia and New Zealand, and ends at Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America, while the American defense line starts from San Pedro in California, goes southwest through Hawaii and Guam, and ends at Manila. At the same time, Britain plans to form a Pacific Fleet to be permanently stationed in Singapore, while the United States will organize an independent Pacific Fleet to prevent Japan. We must know that Britain has so far only the North Sea and Mediterranean Fleets, which are used to defend against Germany and Italy respectively, while the Far East Fleet is only in its infancy. The US Navy is stationed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, relying solely on the Panama Canal as a channel of communication. Once war breaks out, it is also difficult to take care of each other. Furthermore, in terms of the strength of the US Navy, although the tonnage of US and Japanese ships differs by a ratio of five to three, in terms of combat power, it was close to a ratio of five to six just two years ago. In other words, although the tonnage of Japanese ships is not as good as that of the US, their combat power is greater. Generally, the prime of a warship is 18 years. After that, it becomes old and worn. The United States did not have a large-scale shipbuilding plan after the Washington Naval Conference, while Japan was actively carrying it out, so its combat power was not as good as Japan's. It was not until two years ago that the United States began to actively expand its navy, spending a total of 1.5 billion yuan last year, and this year it will be doubled. In addition, with the naval power of Britain, it will be sufficient to deal with Japan.</p>
<p>The formation of a fleet is no easy task. Building a warship takes two years and costs tens of millions, and the organization of a formal fleet must include 125 to 136 warships of all sizes and supplementary ships (generally seven battleships, eight heavy cruisers, twelve light cruisers, and the rest destroyers, torpedo boats, and transport ships). The plans of Britain and the United States are both actively underway, and they should be completed within two or three years. At that time, Japan can be dealt with at will. It can be seen that the international situation in the Pacific today is indeed improving. Why should we be so eager to make peace with Japan, so that even if Britain and the United States want to help us, there is not enough time?" The reporter finally asked, "Since the US naval power is expanding day by day, and there is British assistance, would Japan really dare to start a war with the United States?" He replied, "That is not necessarily the case. After all, Japan is a country ruled by madmen. When madmen are in power, what is impossible?"</p>

<h3>Anglo-Italian Talks Begin; Chamberlain and Others Arrive in Rome Yesterday; Mussolini Hosts a Grand Banquet to Welcome Them</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Genoa, 11th] Before 8:00 this morning, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived in Turin, and transferred to a special train decorated with flowers directly to Genoa. They arrived at 10:00. The Italian government delegation and Genoa city officials all went to welcome them. Large numbers of people from Riviera came to cheer Chamberlain. The British Prime Minister got out of the car for ten minutes to review the honor guard lined up on the platform. The special train will arrive in Rome at 4:30 this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 11th] On the eve of the arrival of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the Italian capital, preparations for the welcome were rushed everywhere, and work was very busy. The central station was full of British and Italian flags and flowers. The rest of the surrounding area was also decorated with flags. A special platform was built in front of the station for British expatriates to welcome the British Prime Minister. At 4:30 this afternoon, the British Prime Minister and others will arrive and take a car to the Villa Madama for lodging. At 5:45, Chamberlain and Halifax will go to the Quirinal Palace for their first meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. At 9:00, the Italian Prime Minister will host a grand banquet in the Palazzo Venezia to welcome them. It is also noteworthy that a group of fifty British reporters arrived yesterday, and reporters from various countries have also rushed to investigate the news.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The preparations here to welcome British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are not as noisy as the previous welcome of Hitler, but the atmosphere is very harmonious and sincere. There has been no official announcement about the issues to be discussed at this meeting. Although London has said that this meeting is of a general nature, people here believe that special issues will be discussed, such as the Spanish war, Franco-Italian relations, Italian colonial demands, the administration of the Suez Canal, the Jewish question, and Anglo-Italian trade. All of these will be discussed. Chamberlain and his party will be welcomed by the Italian government for the first time tomorrow morning at Darling, and will then take a special train to Genoa, arriving at 10:00, where they will be welcomed by the local military and political authorities. Chamberlain and others will arrive in Rome at 4:20 in the afternoon. Foreign Minister Ciano, other cabinet members, and British Embassy personnel will all go to the platform to welcome them. The station will be decorated with flowers and British and Italian flags. After arriving at the station, Chamberlain and his party will travel in seven cars, led by Chamberlain and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, passing through streets lined with troops to Villa Madama, where they will stay.</p>
<p>British and French Governments Reach Unified Views</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and personnel from the French Embassy went to the Gare du Nord to welcome Chamberlain and his party. Flags were fluttering inside the station, and red carpets were laid. Outside the station, crowds were surging. Daladier and Chamberlain, Bonnet and Halifax, took cars to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the crowds cheered and waved to them. The two sides held political talks for seventy minutes. Chamberlain and Halifax, accompanied by the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, took a car to the Gare de Lyon. At 7:30 in the afternoon, the British Prime Minister and his party took a train to Rome. Afterwards, the two sides issued a communiqué saying, "The largely consistent views previously agreed upon by the two governments have now been finalized." It is generally believed that Daladier and Bonnet first presented France's views on Italy's demands, and the British side expressed its full agreement. The two sides then reviewed the overall situation based on previous resolutions. The British side made a general outline of the opinions it wanted to put forward in Rome. The French side also fully agreed. According to information obtained from political circles in Paris, Chamberlain's trip to Rome is not intended to make any special statements, but to listen to the Italian side's views, which are still kept strictly secret. However, if the Italian side seeks the opinions of Chamberlain and Halifax, the two will suggest that the Italian side take the following effective steps: (1) In order to ease the situation in the Mediterranean, Italy is very willing to withdraw its troops from Spain; (2) If Italy wants to resolve all disputes with France, it should negotiate directly with the French government and no longer engage in provocations and incitement in newspapers. If this can be achieved, it will be easier for Italy to achieve its goals vis-à-vis France (such as making Djibouti a free port).</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Today's French Cabinet meeting stated that French Foreign Minister Bonnet had recently sent a note to the French Ambassador to Britain, asking the British government to report exactly what its views were on Italy's demands. It is said that after Bonnet read the note, the French Cabinet unanimously agreed to this firm stance.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] Yesterday morning, all the newspapers in Paris printed the results of last night's meeting between British cabinet members and the French government in large headlines. An Anglo-French agreement was reached on the Mediterranean issue. At the same time, it was confirmed that the British government had sent a note to the French government, stating that the British position had been determined and that France's attitude was in full agreement. The French press is very conservative about Chamberlain's trip to Rome, but believes that the outcome of the meeting depends entirely on whether Mussolini can cooperate.</p>
<h3>Germany's Policy Towards Eastern Europe; Will Extend Political and Economic Influence to the Soviet Border Without Going Through Poland; Ribbentrop Prepares to Visit Poland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] According to the Warsaw correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, after Foreign Minister Beck's talks in Berchtesgaden and Munich, he obtained Hitler's assurance that Germany's policy towards Eastern Europe will not directly attack Poland. In other words, Germany will not provoke Poland in the initial stages. If the results obtained by Chamberlain at the Rome conference do not change the current situation, Hitler will extend Germany's political and economic influence to the borders of the Soviet Union, such as Latvia, Estonia, and Romania, but all routes will not pass through Poland. In the discussions in Berchtesgaden, the means used by Germany in its policy towards Eastern Europe seem to be a combination of tough diplomacy and propaganda. [Reuters, Berlin, 10th] According to well-informed sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, plans to visit Warsaw in the near future, but Ribbentrop will be able to determine the date of the visit only after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visits Germany.</p>
<h3>Eden's Speech; Praises Roosevelt</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in London today that "President Roosevelt's determination of the attitude he holds towards modern world problems on behalf of the United States will surely be permanently recorded in history in the future. The President's speech itself is clear and impartial and can be described as a masterpiece, but its significance does not stop there. President Roosevelt's speech is no less than a signpost, pointing out a path for freedom-loving countries in the world to follow. Therefore, I say that the speech has a 'tonic' effect on the British people and should not be lightly dismissed. I believe my British friends will agree."</p>
<h3>HSBC Bank; Profits Last Year; British Newspapers Unanimously Congratulate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The financial columns of British newspapers unanimously congratulated HSBC Bank today on its profits for last year. The "Times" said, "This proves the financial strength of HSBC Bank and the importance of trade with China." The "Manchester Guardian" said, "Japan has occupied every port in China. HSBC Bank has been able to profit under these circumstances, which is a real success." The "Financial Times" said, "It is not surprising that HSBC Bank's dividends decreased last year." The "Daily Telegraph" said, "This is a great success."</p>
<h3>Extremely Hot Weather; Forest Spontaneous Combustion; Several Factories Destroyed in Victoria, Australia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Melbourne, 11th] Due to the extremely hot weather in Victoria, the forests are spontaneously catching fire everywhere and are still burning. Several homes and factories have been destroyed. The temperature here reached 112.5 degrees yesterday, and other places reached 121 degrees. Rescue workers from all over have been mobilized, but some villages such as Erica are still at risk. Many people are missing. Fire trucks are driving through the disaster area, sounding their sirens as a warning.</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval and Air Force to Conduct Large-Scale Exercises; 66 Aircraft Participating; Flight Distance of 3,000 Miles</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Diego, 10th] The U.S. Navy will begin large-scale aviation exercises. Sixty-six aircraft will participate, including 48 fighter planes that will fly non-stop to the Coco Solo airbase in the Canal Zone. Eighteen seaplanes will fly to the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, with brief stops en route. The number of aircraft participating in this exercise is greater than in previous naval exercises. The flight distance is 3,000 miles. Six warships will be stationed along the route to provide assistance if necessary. The flight of these aircraft will coincide with the southward advance of 100 warships. U.S. authorities are keeping this flight secret. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the U.S. government will issue a report on the flight's progress before this batch of aircraft arrives at the Coco Solo airbase.</p>
<h3>Schacht Returns to Berlin; To Negotiate with Refugee Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] The Governor of the German Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, will return here from Basel tonight and begin negotiations with the Refugee Committee tomorrow. The committee, consisting of several members led by Mr. Rublee, arrived here today. It is reported that these negotiations will be based on the plan Schacht brought to London. However, it has recently been learned that Schacht has indicated that this plan is not Germany's final word. Germany apparently believes that Jews around the world are prepared to stop the anti-German movement in order to help the Jews in Germany. The Germans have good reason to believe that the ability of foreign Jews to help German Jews has been exhausted. It is also learned that Schacht has made a firm guarantee that Germany will not take any more anti-Jewish measures if the negotiations for a resettlement loan do not break down.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congressional Subcommittee Reduces Relief Funds; Roosevelt Suffers First Setback; Woodrum Says It's Temporary</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] A U.S. Congressional subcommittee has decided to reduce President Roosevelt's requested relief funds of $875,000,000 to $725,000,000 and has stipulated certain restrictions. This is President Roosevelt's first setback in Congress. The subcommittee has a Democratic majority and is chaired by Republican Clifton Woodrum. Woodrum declared that the allocation of relief funds would be distributed in mid-May. However, President Roosevelt's setback may only be temporary, as the full Appropriations Committee will meet on Wednesday and has the power to reject the subcommittee's decision.</p>
<h3>Hungarian-Czech Negotiations Break Down Again</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Budapest, 11th] Negotiations between the Hungarian government and Czechoslovakia have broken down again due to the final decision on border demarcation. Unless Czechoslovakia apologizes to Hungary and compensates for the losses, negotiations cannot continue. It is reported that the Hungarian government has requested the British and Italian governments to discuss the Hungarian-Czech dispute at the Rome conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 10th] Hungary protested to Czechoslovakia over the "Mukachevo" incident. Czechoslovakia today issued a reply, suggesting to Hungary the establishment of a "neutral zone" along the entire border between Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. It also pointed out that the "Mukachevo" incident occurred because the Hungarian side fired first. The incident and the incident that occurred in Dusz on Sunday should be handled together by the Hungarian-Czech mixed commission, which should have the final right of judgment.</p>
<h3>Belgium Expresses Attitude Towards the Non-Intervention Committee; Belgium May Withdraw if Resolutions Cannot Be Implemented</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] Today, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak issued a statement to the press after attending a meeting of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that Belgium may withdraw from the "Non-Intervention Committee" if it cannot implement its resolutions, especially the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain. "Belgium has strictly adhered to its principle of non-intervention, but if the Committee is not sufficient to guarantee the implementation of its resolutions, then Belgium, morally speaking, has the obligation to reconsider its position."</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Naval Negotiations; Content Revised and to Be Announced Next Week; Submarine Ratio Permitted to Increase for Germany</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 11th] According to well-informed sources, the Anglo-German naval talks, originally scheduled to be announced this week, have been postponed to next week. It is reported that the content will increase the 45% limitation on German submarine construction stipulated in the 1935 and 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement and proceed with the fourth and fifth 10,000-ton heavy cruisers.</p>
<h3>Selling Naval Secrets; French Destroyer Captain; Jeannotte Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Toulon, France, 11th] French destroyer "Vauquelin" Captain Jeannotte was sentenced to death by the French military court for selling French naval secrets to a foreign country last year during the Czech crisis. An accomplice, a female offender, was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>
<h3>If Germany and Italy Become Warmongers; A Major War Will Erupt; Reports from U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France; European Situation Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] According to a member of the U.S. Military Committee, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy reported to the Committee on the European situation, saying, "A world war may break out this spring." U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt also believes this to be the case. Kennedy believes that if Germany invades Ukraine or Italy seizes Tunisia, a major war will immediately begin. It is reported that Kennedy submitted to the Committee information on the strength of the German Air Force, which was compiled by Colonel Lindbergh, indicating that Germany has 10,000 first-line aircraft and a monthly aircraft production of 1,200. Therefore, the United States must actively prepare.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The Senate and House Armed Services Committees held a joint secret meeting today. U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France both attended to report on the European situation. A congressman who attended stated that the two ambassadors "described the gradual development of the European situation since the Munich Agreement and pointed out the direction of the situation" and said that this should be a "grim picture of peace." Another committee member stated that Ambassadors Kennedy and Bullitt briefly discussed the diplomatic policies of Britain and France and the opportunity for the two countries to appease Hitler and Mussolini, saying that "the two countries do not have much hope for this future of appeasement." The two ambassadors attended the committee for nearly two hours. According to reliable sources, they did not suggest to the authorities that the United States strengthen its national defense strength, but only described the chaotic situation in Europe. Senator Reynolds, who attended the meeting, stood up at the end of the meeting and said that he would report to the Senate in detail on the secret meeting in Japan in the near future, which greatly surprised the audience. According to several committee reports, the committee discussed Colonel Lindbergh's report on the strength of the German Air Force. It is said that the two ambassadors said that this statement would be welcomed by Germany. However, Colonel Lindbergh's report has largely confirmed the views of several military observers. When the committee members left the meeting, they all looked serious. Some committee members no longer concealed the serious situation revealed by the two ambassadors. One committee member said, "Britain and France are both encountering the most significant crisis." If listening to the report this time, as many people here imagine, is to facilitate President Roosevelt's plan to expand the military, then it seems to have been very successful.</p>
<h3>Sino-Estonian Treaty of Friendship Officially Takes Effect; Notes Exchanged in London the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] The Sino-Estonian Treaty of Friendship was signed in London on December 21, 1937, by Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, and the Estonian Minister to Britain. It was approved by the National Government on May 10, 1938, and Quo was appointed as the plenipotentiary representative for the exchange of ratification documents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today received a telegram from Quo stating that the representatives of both parties exchanged ratification documents in London on the 10th of this month. According to Article 8 of the treaty, it officially came into effect from that day.</p>
<h3>International Wheat Conference Held in England the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 11th] The Wheat Committee, composed of 22 wheat-producing countries in the world, held a meeting at the Ministry of Commerce yesterday. U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy has returned to the U.S., so the U.S. Minister to Bulgaria attended. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how to avoid the unfortunate consequences caused by overproduction in several countries, and to use statistical indicators as a reference. At the first meeting, the U.S. representative stated that the United States does not intend to serve as chairman, but this does not mean that the U.S. disregards the rights of the meeting. Therefore, it has not yet been decided which country will chair the next meeting.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet; To Undergo Some Changes</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 11th] It is learned that after Chamberlain returns from Rome, the British Cabinet will undergo some changes. However, there is currently no reliable information on what kind of changes will occur. Since the death of Dominion Secretary Stanley in the autumn of last year, Colonial Secretary MacDonald has also served as Dominion Secretary. It is generally believed that the British government will appoint a Dominion Secretary because MacDonald is currently very busy as the head of the Colonial Office, especially regarding the Palestine issue. Therefore, this is particularly likely.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>National Administrative Improvement</h3>
<p>Our country's war of resistance this time is a war of national revolution, a war of progress. Therefore, with the persistence and development of the war, it has first promoted an unprecedented national unity, followed by the progress of national politics. Since Wang Jingwei's treasonous conspiracy was exposed, our country has once again overcome the adverse tide of peaceful compromise. Therefore, national unity and political progress have an even brighter future!</p>
<p>According to this newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 11th, the central authorities are currently discussing improving national administration. The main points are: (1) The chairmen of various provinces in the war zones concurrently manage military and political affairs, and their status is elevated. This is an important step to make politics and the war of resistance more closely coordinated, which is sufficient to make up for the shortcomings of the past where politics could not keep up with military affairs. (2) Increasing the salaries of county magistrates is also a manifestation that the government has accepted the lessons learned from the 18 months of war resistance, and it is an important step to improve the lower-level political structure. However, the salaries of lower-level civil servants should be further increased universally, and strict measures for punishment and reward should be established to thoroughly eliminate corruption and change social customs. (3) The establishment of temporary provincial councils in all provinces, limited to March 2, is also very noteworthy. In the past, the central government did attach great importance to the establishment of this preliminary public opinion organ, but the failure of various provinces to submit lists on time was due to difficulties in some war zone provinces, but mostly due to the local authorities and public opinion circles ignoring its importance. The government's explanation and propaganda work with various anti-Japanese parties and groups was also insufficient. In the future, all parties should understand that supporting public opinion organs and promoting democratic politics are important steps to complete the cause of the war of resistance and nation-building. If we want the war of resistance and nation-building to be realized quickly, we must first demand the universal realization of the spirit of democratic politics.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>If the United Kingdom and the United States can jointly sanction Japan, then the economic aspect alone will be enough to quickly collapse the Japanese aggressors, or they will have to abandon their policy of aggression and jointly seek normal development. The question is whether Anglo-American joint sanctions against Japan are possible.</p>
<p>The interests of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East are different. The relationships between the United Kingdom and the United States themselves and with Japan are different. The interests of the United Kingdom and the United States are also different. This is one of the important reasons why the Japanese aggressors have dared to run rampant in East Asia for several years. However, as the Japanese aggression forces have developed to this day, the contradictions they have caused with the United States have long exceeded the contradictions between the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the conditions for Anglo-American joint sanctions against Japan have already existed and are becoming increasingly mature. In particular, the Far East industrialists and merchants of the United Kingdom and the United States, who are directly threatened and harmed by the Japanese aggressors, are constantly calling on the United Kingdom and the United States to jointly sanction Japan, and with the urging of public opinion and righteous people in the two countries, the Far East policies of the British and American governments have also become increasingly active. The dispatches from Washington and London in the past few days have stated that British and American authorities are negotiating jointly against Japan, and the scope of discussion is not limited to the economic aspect. Furthermore, the remarks made by the famous diplomat who just returned from the United States, published in today's newspaper, further prove that Anglo-American sanctions against Japan are by no means an empty slogan!</p>
<p>However, if we want Anglo-American sanctions against Japan to be realized earlier and more thoroughly, we must not only step up all steps to improve foreign affairs work, but also do everything possible to deepen Japan's difficulties and make Japan's international status even more isolated. At the same time, we must do everything possible to ensure our country's progress and enhance the international prestige of our government. This is not only hopeful for the government's efforts, but even more hopeful for the national people's endeavors.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Work of the Chinese Branch of the Anti-Aggression League Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Yu Mang</p>
<p>All work in the war of resistance against Japan is anti-aggression work. This includes military, political, economic, cultural... and other departments. If we take the "anti-aggression movement" as the theme to write an article, I am afraid that such a small space cannot handle it. What we want to report to readers today is a review of the work of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League over the past year, from beginning to end, firstly to provide the association with some suggestions for promotion, and secondly to hope that this movement will be further expanded and strengthened.</p>
<p>A week ago, I met Mr. Zheng Yanfen, the director of the executive department of the Chinese branch, and I am grateful to him for telling me about the future development of the association's work. At the end, he also gave me some reference materials. Therefore, I should take this opportunity to thank Mr. Zheng for his kindness!</p>
<p>Historical Review</p>
<p>The organization of the Chinese branch really only began to take shape from January last year, and it has been active for exactly one year now. Speaking of its name, it seems a bit contrived, because the original name of the Geneva General Assembly, translated, should mean "International Peace Movement." However, we changed it to "International Anti-Aggression League." Isn't that a bit contrived? But "we are firmly determined that the Japanese aggression will not stop for a day, and China's war of resistance will not stop for a day; although our ultimate goal is still peace, the peace we seek must be a permanent peace that conforms to public reason and justice." (See Organizational Guidelines.) Then, doesn't this change have its own special significance and meet the needs of the actual environment? Anyway, our war of resistance work is thoroughly an anti-aggression work.</p>
<p>Speaking of the nature and scope of work of the branch, undoubtedly, it is an international mass organization "dedicated to opposing aggressive wars and ensuring world peace." This "is not a military organization, not an academic organization, nor a political group." Therefore, all parties and factions, or those who are non-partisan, as long as they (or she) are not traitors and are enthusiastic about defending world peace and working hard on anti-aggression work, whether individuals or groups, the branch accepts them all.</p>
<p>The establishment of the branch is based on the following four principles:</p>
<p>1. Affirming the dignity of treaty affairs; 2. Utilizing international agreements to reduce and limit armaments, and cracking down on profiteering from the manufacture and sale of armaments; 3. Utilizing collective security and mutual assistance organizations to enhance the strength of the League of Nations to avoid and stop wars; 4. Establishing effective institutions within the League of Nations to adjust international situations that may cause wars.</p>
<p>We said above that as long as they are not traitors, they can be members of the Chinese branch. In this case, it goes without saying that its organization is huge and extensive. The members of the branch, analyzed, belong to individuals, including members of the Chinese Kuomintang, members of the Chinese Communist Party, liberals, anarchists...; and groups include many domestic mass organizations.</p>
<p>The branch and the General Assembly organization are the same, and both adopt a membership system. Mr. Song Ziwen assumed this important task. Under the representative assembly, there is a board of directors composed of 150 people, and another standing committee of 23 people is mutually elected by the board of directors to act on its behalf during the recess of the board of directors.</p>
<p>The branch belongs to the whole country. The first-level local organization under the branch is the sub-branch, with the province as the organizational unit. The address of the association is located in the provincial capital; the second-level local organization is the district association, with the counties and cities of each province as the organizational unit. Those places where the number of members is too small, but must have a center for mutual contact, are provided with communication offices, which are subordinate to the sub-branches or district associations in various places - perhaps directly subordinate to the branch. At present, according to statistics, there are several sub-branches in provinces across the country, including Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi (this was recently established). As for the cities where overseas Chinese are concentrated, such as Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Philippines...etc., there is no sub-branch organization yet; and the district association with the county and city as the unit is even more impossible to talk about now.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] After the fall of various counties in Dongjiang last year, they have been subjected to *enemy* trampling, resulting in vast disaster areas and widespread misery. Huizhou compatriots in the British and Dutch colonies of Nanyang, in order to save the country and their hometowns, specifically organized the Nanyang Huizhou Overseas Chinese Relief Association, and sent a delegation of three people, including Zhong Chunsheng, back to China to be responsible for investigation and relief. The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. After the delegation arrived in Hong Kong, in order to provide widespread relief and benefit refugees, it convened people from various counties of Huizhou in Hong Kong to establish a Hong Kong-based relief office. Since its establishment, after the election of Huang Darong, Chen Chengkuan, and Ke Xiaotang as directors, it has been actively engaged in inland relief work. The office recently received a telegram reporting on the disaster situation after investigation. Just in the disaster area of Huizhou and Boluo, the number of compatriots directly affected by the disaster, without clothes, food, or shelter, is no less than 300,000. After the disaster, the wailing of the victims is everywhere. They have already suffered from exposure to the elements and displacement. Recently, due to the cold weather and piercing wind, the suffering of the refugees is unbearable. Therefore, the office immediately convened a standing committee meeting last night, the 11th, to discuss practical relief matters. More than 20 celebrities from various counties of Huizhou attended, chaired by Huang Darong. It was decided to first produce 10,000 cotton clothes and transport them to the inland to distribute to the refugees in various counties, and it was also decided to first investigate the actual number of refugees in need of relief in Huiyang, Boluo, and Hailufeng and other four counties, as well as the severity of the disaster, and telegram the Huizhou Overseas Chinese Relief Associations in the British and Dutch colonies of Malaya to remit HKD 185,000 to Hong Kong for use.

<h3>Will the Guangdong-Hong Kong Route Be Restored? Jinshan Vessel Sailed to Guangzhou Yesterday: Carrying Only Forty Western Passengers; Absolutely No Chinese Passengers or Cargo</h3>
<p>The Jinshan vessel of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company sailed to Guangzhou yesterday morning. It departed from the Triangle Wharf at 8:00 AM, carrying forty Western passengers and a batch of Singapore firewood, coal ash, and canned food for residents staying in Shamian. There were absolutely no Chinese passengers and no cargo was carried. The scene was extremely desolate and quiet. The waterway between Guangdong and Hong Kong, which had been suspended for nearly three months, was thus declared "reopened."</p>
<p>Negotiation Process Not Publicized</p>
<p>It is known that the Pearl River waterway was sealed off by the 	× after landing in Daya Bay on October 12th last year. The Humen forts declared martial law on the evening of the 14th. Subsequently, after 	× captured Guangzhou, it attempted to monopolize the Pearl River shipping rights, forcibly blockading it and preventing foreign vessels from entering. Although the British government repeatedly protested, there was no result. During the 	× blockade, only the Taikoo vessel Wuchang once carried relief supplies to the province, and British and American warships passed through unhindered several times. Commercial vessels were completely absent. Guangzhou and Hong Kong were cut off for nearly three months. Regarding the recent ability of the Jinshan vessel to sail, the negotiation process has not been officially publicized by the Hong Kong government or the shipping company. However, according to reliable sources, the British and Japanese sides had previously reached an agreement and hoped that there would be two sailings per week in the future. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company had also reached an agreement with the Japanese side not to carry Chinese passengers, cargo, or mail during the company's resumed sailings. Therefore, only Westerners took the vessel to the province yesterday. They were returning to Shamian to manage their businesses in Guangzhou. The attached passenger seats were all Western-style dining rooms, with each passenger ticket costing HK$12. Other rear楼, large cabin and other passenger seats were not carrying passengers.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Macau Route Also Restored</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to the Guangdong-Hong Kong waterway traffic having its initial test voyage restored yesterday, 	×, in an attempt to restore transportation between Guangzhou and other places, sent armed vessels and transport ships to travel between Macau and Guangzhou before reaching an agreement with the British side. Therefore, one sailing per period, has been going on for several sailings. To attract overseas Chinese to return to Guangzhou, all Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese people are allowed to ride in Macau. A special flight allows 30 passengers, but Chinese people attached to 	× must submit two photos and obtain permission from the 	× Consul in Guangzhou, Hong Kong and the Guangzhou 	× military commander before they can take the ride.</p>
<h3>In the Past Week, Tuberculosis Has Claimed Another 112 Lives; Many Also Died from Dysentery</h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the Hong Kong Health Authority yesterday, one case of diphtheria, four cases of typhoid fever, six cases of measles, three cases of chickenpox, two cases of meningitis, and five cases of dysentery occurred in Hong Kong in a single day this week. In the past week, there were four cases of cholera, with one death, six cases of smallpox, with five deaths, ten cases of diphtheria, with seven deaths, one case of scarlet fever, seven cases of typhoid fever, with two deaths, twenty-two cases of dysentery, with eight deaths, two cases of chickenpox, three cases of meningitis, with one death, eighteen cases of dysentery, with eight deaths, and two cases of puerperal fever. In addition, 112 people died from tuberculosis in one week.</p>
<h3>Li Fulin's Proposal: Another Group of Central Committee Members Remaining in Hong Kong Departed for Chongqing Yesterday; Launching Guangdong Guerrilla Forces; Li Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday from a Certain Place and Was Unable to Go to Chongqing Due to Official Business; The Proposal Was Entrusted to the Central Committee Members Going to Chongqing to Be Discussed at the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been rescheduled to be held in Chongqing on the 20th of this month. Central Committee members Chen Fengyuan, You Lugang, Zhan Jusi, and Li Qian, who remained in Hong Kong, had already departed for Chongqing the day before yesterday. The remaining Chen Ce, Hu Jiaocan, Luo Yiqun, Huang Linshu, Chen Qingyun, and Ou Fangpu also took planes or ships to Hanoi yesterday to transfer to Chongqing, in order to attend the meeting on the 20th and discuss national affairs.</p>
<p>Li Fulin Bids Farewell to Central Committee Members Remaining in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Central Committee member Li Fulin rushed to Hong Kong from a certain place the day before yesterday. Reports stated that he would be going to Chongqing, but this news is not factual. According to Li's confidants, Commander Li is responsible for directing guerrilla forces in various locations to kill 	×, and is unable to leave his position for an extended period to attend the meeting in Chongqing. This trip from a certain place to Hong Kong was solely to discuss proposals with the Central Committee members remaining in Hong Kong. Commander Li has an important proposal on the Guangdong guerrilla forces issue, which he entrusted to the Central Committee members attending the meeting in Chongqing to present to the conference for discussion. Furthermore, on the 9th of this month, Commander Li hosted a banquet for the Central Committee members at the Angleterre Hotel in Hong Kong, with Chen Ce, Luo Yiqun, and Li Qian, among others, attending.</p>
<p>Yuan Dai Has Been Promoted to Commander of the Special Operations Unit</p>
<p>Li's confidants further discussed the loyalty and bravery of the people in various places to 重祋 	×. According to reports, Yuan Qi, the original counselor of the Japanese General Headquarters, gathered anti- 	× people in the Zhongshan area after Guangzhou fell, and killed 	× with weapons. In the past two months, he has repeatedly defeated 	×, and is valued by Commander Li. He had previously travelled to a certain place to report to Commander Li on the killing of 	× and to ask for instructions. Commander Li, recognizing his contributions to killing 	×, promoted him to Commander of the Special Operations Unit to inspire him.</p>
<p>Green Forest with Pigtails: Killing 	× Achieved Initial Success</p>
<p>The leader of the Self-Defense Corps, Lu Ling (Yuan Qingzhou), also known as "Pigtail Leader," was ordered by General Li Fulin to lead more than a thousand members of the Shunde Nanhai Self-Defense Corps and strong men to resist the tyrannical 	× after Guangzhou fell. He killed over a thousand 	× in the Battle of Rongqi, Shunde, and seized many war trophies. In the Battle of Longjiang 塡甲, he killed 200 	× and seized three machine guns and two small cannons. A few days ago, when 	× forces attacked Chencun again, Lu Ling led Li Yingri, Huang Chen, and others from Daliang, together with Liang Menghu's unit, to charge three times with hand grenades, eventually sinking six 	× boats, killing more than 200 	×, and seizing many guns and cannons. Later, when a large force of 	× reinforcements arrived, the numbers were too disparate, and since our side had already gained a considerable advantage, they moved to a new position to plan a counterattack. Commander Li, recognizing Lu Ling's repeated contributions to killing 	×, promoted him to Deputy Commander of the First District yesterday.</p>

<h3>British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China: Nobel to Visit Saigon in Mid-Month; Will Meet with French Military Authorities and Transfer to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Due to the confrontation between the fascist and democratic camps, Britain and France demonstrate their close cooperation on the world political stage. This is true in Europe and also in the Far East without the slightest divergence. Recently, there have been frequent reports in newspapers about British and French naval cooperation to protect Far Eastern interests. As a result, the relationship between the British and French military authorities in the Far East, who are responsible for defense, has become increasingly close. Some time ago, the commander of the French Far East Fleet visited Hong Kong aboard the flagship 平傑 to visit the British naval authorities, and later went to Little Luzon for a similar visit. According to investigations by reporters, Vice Admiral Nobel, the British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, is now scheduled to visit Little Luzon and Saigon aboard the flagship Kent on the 15th of this month (Sunday). The ship 花茂 is also traveling. It is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on February 2nd. When arriving in Saigon, they will visit the French military authorities and transfer to Manila.</p>
<h3>Unpredictable Weather: Drastic Temperature Changes; 20 Degrees Difference Compared to Four Days Ago</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather in Hong Kong has been quite volatile. In the past few days, the thermometer suddenly dropped, but it rose sharply again in the past two days. The highest temperature in Hong Kong yesterday reached 72 degrees Fahrenheit, a difference of 16 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the lowest temperature of the previous day, and a difference of 22 degrees compared to the lowest temperature four days ago. The difference between the highest and lowest temperatures that day also reached 11 degrees. Yesterday, the temperature continued to rise. At 10:00 AM, the temperature in Hong Kong was 58 degrees Fahrenheit, and from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the temperature in Hong Kong ranged from 51 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h3>At Bai Shi Tou Zhou Waters: Pirates Rob Another Cargo Boat; Crew Refuses to Surrender and Is Shot and Injured; Stolen Potatoes, Rice, etc. Valued at $170</h3>
<p>In the British-controlled waters of Bai Shi Tou Zhou, another case of a cargo boat being intercepted by three pirates and a crew member being shot occurred at 7:00 AM on the 10th of this month. The victim was the boat 臬號實, owned by Zheng Guicheng, 31 years old. Along with three crew members, he was transporting 30 bags of potatoes and 20 bags of red rice from Shantou to Hong Kong on the 7th of this month. At 7:00 AM on the 10th, when sailing near Bai Shi Tou in Wu territory, a pirate boat carrying three pirates, two of whom were armed with guns, suddenly appeared and chased after them, shouting to stop. However, Zheng, knowing it was a pirate boat, did not answer and continued sailing forward. The pirates, seeing that the boat was still moving forward, fired three shots as a warning. The boat owner, Zheng, fearing that the pirates would become more violent and cause an accident, had no choice but to stop. Shortly after, the pirate boat approached the cargo boat, and the three pirates came to the cargo boat, with the two armed pirates pointing their weapons at everyone. On the cargo boat side, one crew member, Zheng Rongji, 35 years old, refused to surrender and struggled with the pirates. The pirates then fired a gun at Zheng, hitting his right side, causing severe injuries. He immediately fainted in the boat. The others, seeing this, surrendered. The pirates, after subduing everyone, moved the aforementioned cargo to the pirate boat and fled. Afterwards, Zheng Guicheng and the others dared to come out on deck, and seeing that the pirates had fled far away, they set sail towards Hong Kong. They arrived at Shau Kei Wan yesterday morning. The boat owner went to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station to report the incident. The officer on duty, upon hearing the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the boat and called a Red Cross vehicle to the scene to send the injured man to the Mary Hospital for treatment. He also contacted the Marine Police Station to send police boats to search for the pirates in the waters. It is known that the 30 bags of potatoes were worth $120, and the 20 bags of red rice were worth $50, for a total loss of $170.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Will Have a New Development: A Letter from Mr. Zhao Dong</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Committee Has Firm Faith in the War of Resistance, Wang's Departure is a Good Phenomenon</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Dong is the son of the mother of the guerrilla隊, Ms. Zhao, and also a strong general leading the North China guerrilla隊. He is one of the two practical youths admired by patriotic compatriots. Here, there is no need for reporters to introduce him in detail.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Dong only recently left Hong Kong. When he passed through Hong Kong, it attracted attention and welcome from all sides. He once gave a public speech at the Youth Association and also filmed a current affairs film for the Central Film Studio. These, these, readers will surely not forget in their impressions. Where did he go after leaving Hong Kong? What are his recent impressions? How will he develop his work? These, these, must be what patriotic overseas Chinese care about. The following letter is from Mr. Zhao Dong to Mr. ×× in Hong Kong from Chongqing. The content of the original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Brother ××: We arrived in Chongqing on the 27th. That night, we were discovered by newspaper reporters. Visitors came and went to the residence, making it difficult to cope with. My purpose here is to promote the war of resistance and strengthen the confidence of the Chinese people in the war of resistance. Open action is necessary. I have decided to host the press tomorrow (1st) afternoon. After giving a public lecture, I will pay a visit to the central authorities.</p>
<p>Whether we return to North China or participate in the development of guerrilla warfare in South China must be decided after visiting the highest authorities.</p>
<p>Committee Has extraordinary firm confidence in the war of resistance. Recently, it has decided on several important slogans: "Politics is more important than military affairs; the people are more important than soldiers; the rear is more important than the front; ××××××: Guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare." This is based on the current needs of the war of resistance. It is of great importance to the military adjustment and improvement of political institutions. "Wang's departure will not only not hinder the war of resistance, but will also strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. This makes us extremely excited! (Omitted below) Sincerely, The Ceremony of Victory in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Your younger brother, Zhao Dong Wang Mingxuan, together</p>
<p>After reading this letter, we have the following feelings and hopes:</p>
<p>First, after Mr. Zhao visits the highest authorities, there must be a more appropriate arrangement for the mobilization of the guerrilla隊. The development of the guerrilla隊 in the future will definitely have new achievements that can be predicted. This is enough to make us infinitely excited.</p>
<p>The current guerrilla隊 has many shrewd and capable ones, but due to various relationships, there are quite a few drawbacks. Imperfection is unavoidable. However, if shortcomings are not overcome and abuses are not clarified as soon as possible, it is very easy for 	× people and traitors to use it as an excuse to attack the true value of the guerrilla隊 and fall into their tricks of instigating dissension. Therefore, we hope that Mr. Zhao will be able to convey the situation to the top as much as possible when he first visits the highest authorities, so that the measures and arrangements of the highest authorities can be relevant to the current abuses.</p>
<p>Second, "Politics is more important than military affairs, the people are more important than soldiers, the rear is more important than the front, guerrilla隊 is more important than regular warfare." This was originally the general new national policy decided at the Hengshan Military Conference. Mr. Tao Xingzhi once reported this intention to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, who clapped his hands and shouted that China was saved. Now that we have received the same report from Mr. Zhao, it is enough to prove that the national policy passed by the Hengshan Military Conference has been widely valued by all parties. This is indeed a progress gained from bloody lessons. However, readers must not harm the meaning of the words and think that military affairs, soldiers, the front, and regular warfare can be neglected and are not important. A great danger will arise from this misunderstanding. We must understand: In theory, politics should be as important as military affairs; the people should be as important as soldiers; the rear should be as important as the front; guerrilla warfare should be as important as regular warfare. Because the past war of resistance was biased towards these issues, only one aspect was considered while neglecting the other, so the current rectification is "for the current needs." "Rectification" is necessary, but it must not be "overcorrected". Therefore, I hope that readers will pay special attention to the seven words in the letter, "针对目前的需要".</p>
<p>Third, "Wang's departure makes us extremely happy" is the truth, because Wang Jingwei's betrayal is inevitable. He cannot keep up with the progress of the times, and insists on maintaining his political status. Therefore, he has no choice but to disregard the interests of the nation, and pat himself with his personality, in order to "struggle" before the illusion disappears. There is no doubt that this small wave will be submerged by the great tide. Eliminating corrupt elements and clarifying politics is a good sign of progress.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis! Tuberculosis!</h3>
<p>— A Talented Writer</p>
<p>A Special Product of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Tuberculosis, the terrifying tuberculosis—the moment I hear the sound of coughing from people suffering from colds in winter, it immediately reminds me of that dreadful, deadly tuberculosis. To this day, the world still lacks an effective cure for tuberculosis, and so many Chinese people suffer from it; especially in Hong Kong, according to the Health Bureau's reports, the number of deaths from tuberculosis every week is always over a hundred. Every time I see this statistical table, it sends chills down my spine; Hong Kong seems to be a place that specially produces tuberculosis!</p>
<p>The causes of tuberculosis, besides heredity or contagion, are (1) overwork; (2) insufficient nutrition; (3) poor air quality. The Chinese people living in Hong Kong happen to fulfill these three conditions, so it is natural that tuberculosis is particularly prevalent among them. The impoverished Chinese masses, as long as they have food to eat, do not care about whether they are overworked or not. Every day they work twelve or even sixteen hours, exhausting all their mental and physical strength. Overwork is not the only concern, they must also guard against the boss's dissatisfaction and losing their jobs. Work efficiency is at its highest, while pay efficiency is at its lowest. Think about it, in Hong Kong, where rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, and the cost of living is so high, the meager pay they receive is barely enough to fill their stomachs. Expensive foods like a pound of beef, eggs, or even chicken for every meal are unimaginable for those with sallow complexions. As a result, they become people who lack all the essential nutrients simultaneously.</p>
<p>When it comes to air quality, there's no need to even mention it. I remember a professor from a French university once analyzed a cubic meter of air in a city and found that at 7 a.m. there were 600 microbes, which increased to 1,800 by 11 a.m., 23,000 by 12 p.m., 72,000 by 2 p.m., and 88,000 by 8 p.m. Based on this, the air in the city is practically teeming with microbes, making it uninhabitable. Moreover, the population density of Hong Kong surpasses that of any other prosperous city. Fortunately, no one has analyzed the air here, otherwise, the number of microbes would surely be even more alarming. But even though it is uninhabitable, countless people live in this environment of poor air quality. It's not that they aren't afraid of microbes, it's not that they aren't afraid of tuberculosis, but for the sake of survival, they have no choice but to take the risk. The more people who take the risk, the wider the spread of tuberculosis, and the statistics of deaths from tuberculosis only increase every week.</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone discovered that the severity of tuberculosis in Hong Kong was due to overpopulation. Indeed, a narrow and cramped apartment, usually housing thirty or forty people, has a significant impact on hygiene. The cause has been discovered, so they want to design improvements. The most direct method would be to limit the number of residents, but this is an impractical idea for the wealthy, while the tenants wish they could squeeze in even more people!</p>
<p>I often consult a doctor about the problem of tuberculosis, and he said: "If you were to carefully examine them, more than half of the people in Hong Kong have tuberculosis. Those who have it often don't even know it themselves, and by the time it manifests, it's beyond cure. I recently treated a young girl who used to be very lively and innocent, not like someone who was sick. Later, because she coughed for several weeks and cough syrup didn't help, an X-ray revealed that she already had three cavities in her lungs, and tuberculosis had reached the third stage. There is no effective medicine for treating tuberculosis. The most reliable method at present is still injecting air. 'Air injection' is a common term; in reality, it is called artificial pneumothorax. After the lungs have been eroded by tuberculosis bacteria and become cavities, taking medicine will not be effective. Even prolonged rest can only increase body weight, but it won't help the cavities in the lungs heal. Artificial pneumothorax involves injecting gas into the pleural cavity to cause the lungs suspended in the pleural cavity to shrink due to the pressure of the injected air. The cavities in the lungs close up as the lungs shrink, and after a long time, they heal. Because the gas injected into the pleural cavity disappears, many injections are needed, starting with once every two or three days, then gradually extending to once a week. This method can cure 80 percent of cases, but it is not suitable for many tuberculosis patients. However, we still believe that prevention is better than cure when it comes to tuberculosis."</p>
<p>After this doctor finished speaking, he offered to give me a free examination, to take an X-ray to see if I had tuberculosis. But I ultimately didn't have the courage to be examined. I thought to myself: "If I were to find out that I have a severe case of tuberculosis, that would be terrible. I need to eat, I can't afford to rest for a long time, and I am penniless, I don't have the money to treat it. Knowing it would only cause me pain. Right now, I don't know whether I have tuberculosis or not, but I am working as usual, and I am much happier. Anyway, Hong Kong is known for producing tuberculosis, so having it wouldn't make me a special person!"</p>

<p>Transportation and Implementation</p>
<h3>Gushan in Fuzhou (2)</h3>
<p>— Shao Yanqing</p>
<p>After walking through this corridor, we were greeted by a large reception hall called "Xingju Hall." Here, we met a monk in charge, who went to great lengths to help us find a monk's room on the left side of the hall. Originally, on the right side of the hall, there was a newly built building called "Mingyue Building." This building was donated by patrons of the temple to provide accommodation for visitors. However, on this particular day, three or four hundred students from a certain school had arrived, occupying the entire building. We had no choice but to settle in the monk's room, experiencing the flavor of monastic life. This room was quite spacious, with three beds arranged in it. However, there wasn't a single window that allowed sunlight to enter. Fortunately, there was a small skylight in the ceiling, which at least provided some light. Of course, there was no mention of fresh air. When we first entered, we were greeted by a foul odor, but after sitting for a while, we didn't notice it anymore.</p>
<p>After arranging our belongings in the room, we hurriedly went out to visit the temple's "kitchen." What surprised me most were the four large woks installed on the stove, each with a diameter of seven or eight feet. Because the pot lids were too heavy, they were suspended by ropes. When needed, one only had to push a handle, and the rope would slowly move the pot. When we entered, the woks were full of millet porridge, steaming hot. Behind the stove, the ground was slightly lower, and a fire-tender was diligently stuffing the firewood gathered from the mountain into the stove. It is said that these fire-tenders were mostly farmers from Lianjiang and Xinghua counties in Fujian. Due to rural bankruptcy, they left their hometowns to seek a living. Their annual wages in the temple were only fifty or sixty yuan, but the temple provided food and lodging, so it was better than toiling in the fields all year round without getting enough to eat.</p>
<p>After dinner, we strolled to Mingyue Building. The building was built like a student dormitory, with two rows of rooms connected together, one row facing south and the other facing north. Each row had a long corridor in front of it. I casually walked along the northbound corridor, looking into each room through the window. Small students and middle school students were chatting in twos and threes. Some were playing the harmonica, while others were gathered around listening to the teacher tell stories. In another corner of the corridor, a group of boys and girls were surrounding a young man in a Zhongshan suit—probably their teacher—singing patriotic songs. The young man was holding a ruler-long bamboo stick, waving it up and down, left and right, and the singing followed the rising and falling rhythm. In this environment of despondency and decadence, there was actually a trace of positive energy, which could not help but make one feel quite gratified.</p>
<p>Back in the dark and damp "monk's room," we talked for a while, and everyone felt tired. We went into our quilts and fell asleep. The next morning, at dawn, we got up to wash and prepare to climb the highest peak (that is, the highest peak of Gushan). It turned out that the Yongquan Temple where we were staying was located halfway up the mountain. Looking up from the square in front of the temple, this peak was behind the temple, and the top of the peak was directly above the main hall of the Daxiong Palace.</p>
<p>At about seven o'clock, we started from the back door of the temple and hired sedan chairs for taking turns and carrying our belongings. In the beginning, we meandered up the yellow soil slopes, passing through many low pine forests. The higher we went, the soil slopes gradually disappeared, leaving only smooth mountain rocks. Shallow steps were carved on the rocks. Fortunately, everyone was wearing rubber-soled or cloth-soled shoes, so we didn't slip. As the sun gradually rose higher, the heat increased accordingly, and I took off my clothes one by one. By the time we reached the Buddha's Hand Rock, I was only wearing an undershirt and a shirt. At this time, we had already walked more than half of the journey. Looking up at the highest peak, it seemed to be right in front of us. The peak looked a bit like a bald head, so bare that not even a single tree could be seen. When we were about to reach the top of the mountain, there was a stone pavilion. In the pavilion, there were incense burners to the bodhisattva. There was nothing else. To the right of the pavilion, there were broken walls and ruins, weeds and rocks, full of desolate antiquity.</p>
<p>After passing the stone pavilion and moving forward, we began to circle around the top of the mountain. Near the peak, there was a stone stele inscribed with "Tongxiao Road." Attached to the stele was a fork in the road that led to Guling (a summer resort for the people of Fujian). After passing this stele, the mountain path twisted and the wind gradually increased, indicating that the peak was right in front of us. At this time, I was extremely excited. I held my hat and ran to the top of the mountain in one breath. The top of the mountain was still flat, about one acre in size. Near the center, there was a stone bench five or six feet long. The stone bench was covered with dry yellow weeds. The wind was constantly blowing, causing every blade of grass to dance wildly. Almost nothing on top of the mountain was still. Our hair, scarves—everything danced with the rhythm of the strong wind.</p>
<p>Looking north from the peak, one mountain after another rose and fell silently around us. The morning sunlight shone obliquely on the mountain ranges on the opposite side, illuminating the undulating peaks with light and shadow. The revelation of this magnificent nature could not help but fill one's heart with a pleasant feeling. The most interesting thing was the famous Guling of Fujian, which looked like a small hill from here. One could only see exquisite Western-style houses sparsely dotted on the mountainside.</p>
<p>Many inscriptions from previous people were carved on the rocks on the peak, mostly dating from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Among them, those related to the mountain peaks included "No Mountain Can Compare," "Half-Sky Mountain," "Climbing the Peak to the Utmost," "Shaking Out Clothes," and "Drum Top." Because the wind was too strong, I didn't feel like looking closely. Just as I was about to descend the mountain, I suddenly heard the sedan chair carriers say that there was another stone pavilion over there. So everyone walked to the south slope of the mountain peak. Strangely enough, the climate here was completely opposite to that on the other side. Everything seemed gentle and peaceful. Near the southeast corner, there was a dilapidated stone pavilion, perched on a large rock. The roof of the pavilion was gone, leaving only two pillars. One pillar was standing, and the other was almost toppled over. From this, one could also see the power of the mountain wind. Near the stone pavilion, there was a stone about six feet high, with the four characters "A Panoramic View of the Mountains" engraved on it, as well as "Sea and Sky View Pavilion" and "Heavenly Peak Sea Wave Pavilion," presumably the names of the pavilions. From here, after a few more steps, one reached the end of the highest peak. Below were grotesque rocks. From here, looking around the Five Tiger Mountains, one could only see a vast sea of clouds and the mountains looming. The vastness of the ocean was breathtaking. Looking down at the Min River, the waterway was winding like a rainbow. The west end was connected to the upper reaches, dividing Fuzhou City and Nantai, and the east end was connected to Weiba and Luoxing Pagoda. On this silver ribbon-like Min River, only patches of sails were dotted on it, with a few small steamships slowly crawling on the river surface. Unless one stared intently, one would hardly notice them moving. The Fuma Highway built along the river looked like a long, narrow golden belt under the autumn sun. Unfortunately, there were too few vehicles coming and going, so it was inevitable that there was a sense of desolation. In addition, there was an endless expanse of fields. A seaplane, lightly taking off from Jiangxi, circled a few times over the rice fields on the opposite bank, like a small dragonfly. The sound of the plane gradually faded, and the body of the plane gradually disappeared in the blur—all of this was simply a beautiful autumn picture, making people reluctant to leave. I took several photos of the mountain scenery. It was almost noon when everyone followed the original path down the peak, wanting to rush to Baiyun Cave for lunch. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Returning from Changsha (2)</h3>
<p>— Lu Dongren</p>
<p>We thought that after arriving in Changsha, we would definitely be able to go to Hankou. We were always hoping for it, but as soon as we arrived in Changsha, the train conductor told us, "The section of the road from Changsha to Hankou has been destroyed by × airplanes and cannot be reopened." When we heard this, we felt a pain in our hearts. The ruthless × airplanes had blocked our progress like this. This was indeed a great blow to us. Our progress was blocked here. Since the train could not run, we had no choice but to go to the station to refund the ticket the next day. That night, when we got off the train in Changsha at nine o'clock, we saw that the area around the station was a scene of smoke and fire that made people sad to see. This was the gift given by the × airplanes. After getting off the train, the two of us only hired a rickshaw. We slowly walked through several street intersections on the dimly lit street before finding a hotel. The service in this hotel was not very good, and the facilities inside were also not very complete. The staff were all from Hunan. We spoke Mandarin to them, and we could understand each other. Because we were tired from two days and nights of traveling, we were able to recover our spirits in the sleep of that night. The next morning, after eating breakfast, × airplanes came to bomb us. The owner of the hotel was very kind. His name was You Jinhai. He personally took us to a village to hide. As soon as we stepped out of the hotel door, we saw that many buildings had become rubble and flesh and blood were everywhere. The scene was so tragic that it was unbearable to look at. This kind of tragedy only increased the people's determination to resist ×. Although Changsha was harassed by × airplanes every day, the market was still prosperous and the roads were quite wide. Mr. You took us to sit in the home of a farmer, but during emergency alerts, we still had to go to the forest to hide. This continued until four o'clock in the afternoon when the alert was lifted. Changsha can be said to be attacked by enemy planes every day. Because of this situation, we had no choice but to return to Hengyang and take the road to Guilin, Guangxi, intending to find some work to save the country or find something to learn. After the alarm was lifted, we also asked the gentlemen to take us to the station to refund Cai, and purchased tickets to Hengyang. At the station, the most eye-catching thing was the train loaded with wounded soldiers transported back from the front. Some of them had injured their feet, and some had injured their hands and heads. The plight of hobbling along after getting off the train was truly admirable and pity. There were also those who were more seriously injured, lying on the station. A company commander was seriously injured, and his wound was not covered with medicine. In the cold night, he groaned and screamed in pain. Listening to the tragic sound, it was almost impossible not to shed tears. Think about it, he was both frozen and in pain, but how great he was. He had fulfilled his duty as a citizen. But I don't know what the young masters and young ladies who linger in the cities would feel when they heard this. The wounded company commander was like this, and the lower-ranking soldiers go without saying. It can be seen that in this war of resistance, the level of care and protection requires our efforts and assistance in the rear. The weather was very cold that night, and I was almost frozen to the point of jumping up. We waited for several hours until late at night before a train finally departed. During the journey, × airplanes came to attack several times, but we safely arrived in Hengyang on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>
<p>When coming to Hengyang from Changsha, there were two Cantonese people with the surname Li in the same car. They were rice merchants from Hengyang whom we met while waiting for the train at the station. Upon arrival, they introduced us to a Cantonese hotel to stay. The air defense facilities in Hengyang were relatively complete, so we felt much calmer. The commerce in Hengyang was quite prosperous, but one thing that was a bit special was the barber shop business. It was almost entirely in the hands of women. For the convenience of taking the train, even our two leather suitcases were all sold. We packed all our clothes into a large package and carried it on our backs, looking like travelers. We stayed here for one day. The next day, we took the train to Guilin in the afternoon. The fare from Heng to Guizhou was only five and a half dollars. There was a car at the ticket office to send us to the West Station to get on the train.</p>
<p>This was in Guilin on the afternoon of the 23rd. We were very excited because this was the provincial capital we had admired for a long time. After getting off the train, there was a car to pick us up into the city. When we were about to enter the city, we registered our names and checked our luggage at a luggage inspection office. We passed through many city gates before entering the city. After getting off the car, we hired two rickshaws to stay at the Xiang E Hotel. "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world" truly lives up to its name. The majesty of the mountains has never been seen before. They are scattered, pointed peaks, rising into the clouds. At a glance, they give people a different feeling. The young men and women students in Guangxi wear simple military uniforms and are full of energy. They are truly soldiers who will defend the country and kill × in the future. There are also farmers, workers, and merchants who have generally received considerable military training. There are air defense exercises in the city from time to time, and the people are orderly and not chaotic. They are doing practical work step by step in accordance with the government's regulations. Guangxi University was originally in Liuzhou. Guilin only has primary and secondary schools. Secondary schools pay great attention to car training. We fully thought that we would be able to join a certain organization to save Guangxi there, but it did not meet our wishes because we are ashamed that we have not received rigorous military training, nor do we have rescue knowledge. We only have a passion, but our strength is not enough. Since we cannot go to the front to fight, it is better to run back to the rear and work hard. At the same time, in Guilin, where white goods are expensive, living will also become a problem because our remaining travel expenses are about to run out. We stayed in Guilin for two days and wanted to go to Nanning again. At that time, all the cars were used for military purposes, and only one or two cars could reach Liuzhou. This was really a coincidence. When buying tickets at the car company, we wanted to send a telegram to Annam asking for remittance, but we didn't know what banks in the area could remit money. We asked a Henan person, who also came to the station to buy tickets to Liuzhou. He was going to take the road to Annan Hanoi and then transfer to Yunnan United University to study. We thought that staying here was not a good strategy, and it would be best to go to Annam. This Henan man was very sincere. During our conversation, we learned that his surname was Yang. So we wrote a sincere letter to him, asking him to help with the travel expenses to Hanoi. After receiving our letter, he agreed to our request. We were really grateful and felt lucky to have Mr. Yang's help. So the three of us set off on the 29th, taking a public bus to Liuzhou. The fare from Gui to Liu was seven and a half dollars. The seats were very good, but on the car, if you don't wear glasses and tie a handkerchief on your nose and mouth, you will be blinded by the mud and sand that the car kicks up in your face and your mouth and nose will be filled. We quickly arrived in Liuzhou at four o'clock that foot.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived in Liuzhou, we heard the bombing of × airplanes all the time. The most eye-catching thing there was "Guangxi University". We only stayed for one night. The next morning, because there were no passenger cars, we had to find two more people and hire a small car to move forward. This road to Nanning was very flat and rarely bombed by × airplanes. Along the way, there were sharp peaks that towered high above the clouds. We crossed two small rivers and passed through many small market towns. The journey of a whole day sent us to this new place again - Nanning.</p>

<h3>Local Market Conditions for Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Native Paper: Supply from Guangdong and Guangxi Severed, Prices Rise by Half</h3>
<p>Native paper produced in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi in our country is a major commodity. Exports account for a significant proportion annually. However, due to the dumping of foreign paper, the native paper market has been greatly affected. Hong Kong was originally a distribution center for native paper, but recently the market has become even more depressed due to the impact of the war. The market conditions for products from various provinces in Hong Kong are described below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Products: (1) Changjiang Yu Kou Paper, produced in Shixing, Beijiang, is usually shipped to Hong Kong via Shaoguan and Guangzhou. Annual imports are approximately 30,000 bundles (50 catties per bundle). Previously, each bundle was valued at six yuan, but the current market price is nine yuan per bundle. Superficially, the price is lower than before, but in terms of the Hong Kong-Guangdong exchange rate, the difference is significant. Therefore, the current price is virtually much higher than before. (2) Dongzhuang Yu Kou Paper, produced in Nanxiong and the surrounding areas of southern Jiangxi, with annual imports of approximately 50,000 bundles. The former price was five yuan per bundle, and the current price is six yuan per bundle. The above two types of native paper are mainly sold to the South Seas Islands, accounting for more than 60% of the total, while 40% is consumed locally in Hong Kong. (3) Scripture Paper, used by students for writing exercises, is 75 knives per bundle. (4) Heavy Barrel Paper, used for making firecrackers, is 50 knives per bundle. Both types are produced in Fuhan, Baishun, and other places, with annual shipments to Hong Kong estimated at 20,000 bundles each, valued at two and a half yuan per bundle. It is estimated that the annual trade volume of Guangdong native paper in Hong Kong reaches 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fujian Products: Yu Kou paper is the largest product of the province, used as raw material for manufacturing ledgers and stationery. It is of excellent quality and more expensive. The domestic and foreign sales markets are not weak, with export routes usually shipping through Shantou to Hong Kong. Since the fall of Xiamen last year, the new production areas in the interior have also become tense, and paper mills have produced very little. Therefore, the supply to the Hong Kong market has dried up. Fujian Yu Kou paper is divided into Four-Knife Zhuang, Four-and-a-Half-Knife Zhuang, Five-Knife Zhuang, and Six-Knife Zhuang. The first two types are most suitable for the Hong Kong market, with a total of 50,000 to 60,000 bundles imported to Macau and Hong Kong annually. The best quality is five yuan per knife (approximately ten catties), medium quality is four yuan, and low quality is three yuan. The annual trade volume is approximately 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Guangxi Products: (1) Wan Jin Paper, produced in Guilin, is used as raw material for firecrackers. The largest amount is transshipped to Macau because many firecracker factories are established there. Annual imports are approximately 100,000 bundles, valued at one yuan and seven to eight jiao per bundle. (2) Yu Kou Paper, a very coarse paper, commonly known as grass paper, with annual imports of approximately 18,000 bundles, valued at two yuan per bundle. Local consumption accounts for 80%. (3) Gauze Paper, the most common paper produced in Guangxi, with annual imports estimated at 70,000 to 80,000 bundles, valued at two to three yuan per bundle. The annual trade volume of Guangxi paper in Hong Kong (including shipments to Macau) reaches more than 600,000 yuan. It is estimated that the supply of Guangdong and Guangxi native paper to Hong Kong is almost non-existent, and the supply from Fujian is also low. Therefore, the price of paper has risen by 50% compared to before.</p>

<h3>British Relief Fund Hong Kong Branch Plans to Hold Charity Football Match; Football Association Pre-Determines Li Huitang as Center Forward for Hong Kong Interport Team; Shanghai Footballer Bei Lu Comes to Hong Kong to Play for Kowloon Club</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] Out of sympathy for the British Relief Fund Hong Kong Branch, it plans to hold a charity football match in the near future to raise funds for the relief of Chinese refugees. It is heard that the Chairman of the Fund, Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote, has sent a letter to the Football Association proposing this idea, requesting the Association to find a way to make the event successful.

<p>A member of the Football Association's representative selection committee for the Hong Kong Interport team, visited Li Huitang yesterday to inquire about his opinion on whether he would be willing to be a representative, because all the selection committee members believe that he is also the ideal center forward for the Hong Kong team.

However, because he has been invited by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and may go to Shanghai at that time, he has not yet given a definite answer to the committee member.</p>
<p>Bei Lu is a footballer from Shanghai, but the team he played for in Shanghai has not yet been verified. After arriving in Hong Kong, he was recruited by the Kowloon Club. It is heard that his defensive midfielder skills are very good. This Saturday and Sunday, Kowloon Club will play against Eastern in the First Division League.

<h3>Women's Basketball Last Night: Each Game Was Quite Competitive; Pui To, Overseas Chinese, and South China Win</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] Last night, three women's basketball games were held. Because it was not a clash between strong teams, the atmosphere was not very heated. Speaking of the battles, it was okay for Hong Kong University and Southwest to win, and the game between Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong University was also quite tense, with a good atmosphere.</p>
<p>At half past six, the god of war arrived at the gym. Pui To played against Southwest. After the tip-off, Southwest first scored two points directly from a free throw, opening the scoring. After a while of chaotic play, Southwest scored another point, taking a 3-0 lead. The Southwest players, seeing that the loss was still small, calmly responded. After a long time, Ruixin finally won a point back for their team, ending the first quarter at 4-2.</p>
<p>After the restart, Yiyin took advantage of the continuous fouls to add one point. At this time, Southwest assigned Zhi to replace Cui Rong, greatly boosting morale. However, Yiyin's shooting was divinely assisted, and she frequently scored points. The Southwest players could only sigh helplessly. When the score reached 11-6, the break time arrived again.</p>
<p>In the second half, under the control of Pui To, Southwest could only score three points thanks to the efforts of Ruixin and Zhi, and then gained nothing. However, Chan Hing and Wan Zhen played very hard. Therefore, although Pui To was able to end this quarter with a 20-11 victory, they sought to avoid being too strenuous.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, Southwest still hoped to gradually recover their lost ground, but the Pui To players did not dare to underestimate the enemy. Therefore, the score continued to rise until the end of the whole game. Pui To finally defeated Southwest with a score of 28-16.</p>
<p>With the first game over, the next match began. This game was between Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong University. Originally, the strength of Overseas Chinese was much better than that of Hong Kong University. However, due to the absence of Rongtang and the loss of an old partner by Shougong, the impact was great. In addition, since Hong Kong University got Wenhua to direct them again, and after adjusting Li Zongru to Siam to guard, they were able to implement a man-to-man defense policy, greatly improving their strength. Therefore, at the end of the first quarter, Hong Kong University, with their efforts, was able to take the lead with a score of 7-4.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Overseas Chinese performed more vigorously than in the previous quarter, but because they lost three points, it took time to recover. Moreover, Wenhua also scored several times, so at the end of the first half, Overseas Chinese only took the lead by two points with a score of 16-14.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, the morale of Overseas Chinese was even higher. Shougong weaved through the defense, making him very difficult to catch. He was truly skilled. Hong Kong University only scored three free throws in this quarter. Therefore, their score gradually fell behind, and they were no longer as majestic as at the beginning.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, Hong Kong University once connected through Wenhua, and the score gradually caught up. Unexpectedly, after five minutes, the momentum was gone. Moreover, the end of the game was not far away. Just as Wenhua scored two penalty shots, the whistle blew, and Overseas Chinese returned triumphantly with a score of 32-27.</p>
<p>In the last game, South China played against Huai Za. Paulo was mostly new material, and their strength was weak. South China should have won by a large margin, but because Ruomei and Yu divided the opportunities repeatedly, the scores were not too far apart. Speaking of the battle, it was very interesting. However, due to space limitations, I will not say more. The final score is as follows. (Man Under the Basket)</p>
<h3>Inter-School Table Tennis Tournament: Kowloon Wins</h3>
<p>The table tennis school team league match between Ren and Kowloon was held at the Eastern Club last night. Kowloon was one step ahead and defeated Queen's College with a score of 5-0.</p>
<h3>Movies and Theatre</h3>
<p>Entertainment... The Little Lord Fauntleroy</p>
<p>Lord Jelf</p>
<p>It is a film with educational significance, and will be of great interest to every parent and general child and youth.</p>
<p>Freddie Bartholomew, the child star who moved every audience in "David Copperfield," here plays an orphaned boy who has been spoiled by education, exploited by a pair of cunning con men, and trained to claim to be the son of a certain nobleman, traveling around to swindle people. He is later arrested and sent to a criminal school, where he is forced to learn some nautical skills. The story tells of his life and that of his classmates of his type. One of his classmates is played by the boisterous and lively child star Mickey Rooney, who has already become a junior officer at the school. The counterfeit little aristocrat is captured after escaping once, but later becomes a friend.</p>
<p>We still remember that these two child stars once worked together in "Captains Courageous." Although the personalities they portrayed were very different, they had a very complementary effect and were a very good pair of partners. Now their ages have grown slightly, and their acting skills have become more mature, especially with regard to the nature of young people. Adding an interesting story, and the children's sincere, enthusiastic and courageous performances, enriches the content of this film.</p>
<p>Empress... Give Me a Sailor</p>
<p>Give Me A Saflor</p>
<p>The previous collaborations between Huan Sharei and Bob Hope have all been extremely successful. In this film, there is a more outstanding performance, proving that they are still a very suitable partner. The film is full of endless jokes, and is an ideal work for audiences who watch movies for entertainment.</p>
<p>The story depicts the crazy and dissolute lives of some American sailors on vacation. Among them, a pair of brothers on the same ship made a lot of jokes because they pursued the wrong love object.</p>
<p>Marais is the central figure of the film. She plays a girl who is lonely and infatuated. From beginning to end, she maintains an excellent performance. Bob's embarrassing facial expressions and his humorous and witty lines can be called unparalleled.</p>
<p>Also starring Betty Grable, a beautiful and lively star, she also has a clear and melodious singing voice. The film has a total of four new songs, all recent works by famous musicians, sung by the two of them, adding a lot of entertainment value to the film.</p>
<p>Ping An... The Spy Ring</p>
<p>The Spy Rfng</p>
<p>A spy color film with nothing commendable. The director failed to give full play to the activities and adventurous plots of the spies. In addition, he forced the insertion of polo matches and some humorous scenes, piecing together this mismatched film.</p>
<p>The story tells how a group of international spies operate in the United States, trying to steal the drawings of a newly invented air defense weapon, but because of the inventor's heroic and cleverness, their cunning scheme is finally shattered. The acting skills of all the actors are also very mediocre.</p>
<p>Eastern... I Cover The War</p>
<p>I Cover The War</p>
<p>An early war film depicting the rebellion in Mesopotamia, while inserting a romance. If you look at it with today's eyes, then the few war scenes inside are no longer successful. The protagonist is John.</p>
<p>Dahua... You're Only Young Once</p>
<p>You’re Only Youug Once</p>
<p>It is a very beneficial social film for young people, giving young men and women a powerful inspiration in the area of love.</p>
<p>The story tells of a happy family. The master is a fair and wise judge. He has one son and one daughter. When his whole family travels in California, his children each embark on the wrong path of complex love. He painstakingly rescued his children.</p>
<p>Although it is a very ordinary story, because the director's technique is not weak, it develops very clearly and lively. In terms of actors, because they are properly allocated, there are good performances, especially Louis Dayton, who plays the judge, portrays the performance of understanding the psychology of young people in love.</p>
<p>Jing Xing... To Mary - With Love</p>
<p>To Mary Wfth Love</p>
<p>A social romance film starring Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy.</p>

<h3>Charity Volleyball Match: Lingnan University and St. Paul's Agree; Date of Event Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's War Relief Association is sparing no effort in aiding refugees. Recently, they initiated a charity volleyball match, and sent a letter to Lingnan University and St. Paul's, requesting that each team send a team to compete, with the proceeds going to refugee relief. Lingnan and St. Paul's, considering this a righteous cause, have both agreed. Lingnan University has already given its permission and replied to the Women's War Relief Association. St. Paul's is also willing to participate, but the venue and date of the match have not yet been determined and will be announced once preparations are complete.</p>
<h3>Training Methods for Track and Field</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should not take those photos as our sole basis, nor should we overemphasize one or a few movements. We should conduct a precise and systematic study of the various movements involved in a sport. We should follow in the footsteps of famous athletes, but merely copying their superficial aspects will not only lead to no progress but often to regression.</p>
<p>For track and field athletes, the most important thing is the coordination of all body movements. To achieve coordination, exercises to develop muscles must be performed simultaneously. The training of track and field athletes should be step-by-step, establishing a solid foundation first. To have correct methods and beautiful posture, one should start with the most basic training. Muscle development also varies according to the different needs of each sport. For example, in shot put, special attention should be paid to the shoulders, back, arms, chest, legs, and buttocks. When practicing this sport, we should start with the most basic methods and develop the muscles of the shoulders and back to the strongest possible level.</p>
<p>The most important thing in developing a track and field athlete is basic training. Training a beginner is already difficult because the beginner's movements are not coordinated, and their body is not balanced. However, training an athlete who has received incorrect training is even more difficult. Such an athlete naturally has no hope of reaching the peak. Therefore, an athlete who wants to become famous must receive proper training from the beginning.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as the movements are coordinated and the body is balanced, track and field is not a difficult thing. But to have coordinated movements and a balanced body, one must first have a healthy physique.</p>
<p>In addition to developing the muscles that are most needed during exercise to the strongest possible degree, other parts of the body should not be completely neglected. For example, many long-distance or short-distance runners only focus on training their legs and neglect other parts. In fact, the most important part is the torso, as the body's center of gravity is within the torso. Our strength and various movements are closely related to the torso.</p>
<p>For example, long-distance or short-distance runners rely entirely on the foundation of their body for their leg movements, that is, the lower abdomen and buttocks. Also, when hurdling or high jumping, the muscles that control the extension and contraction of the legs are the lower abdominal muscles, waist muscles, and erector spinae muscles. When throwing or pushing, if the serratus anterior (located under the pectoralis major) and latissimus dorsi (located under the armpit) are used simultaneously to twist the body, the results will be far better than just using the biceps and triceps of the upper arm. However, many long-distance or short-distance runners waste a lot of time on exercises such as alternately swinging their legs forward and backward as far as possible. They think that this will give them a wide stride. Even worse, they overemphasize the muscles of the lower leg and do not fully utilize the quadriceps femoris on the front of the thigh, and almost completely neglect the muscles of the buttocks and back. These muscles control the movement of the legs when running, such as ensuring that the feet and legs are not raised too high when lifted backward. All of these points must be carefully considered when running. Short-distance runners who focus on training the lower leg can increase their running speed, but they cannot reach the highest speed, and progress almost completely stops after a certain point. This is because they only focus on training the lower leg, and as a result, the lower leg muscles are very developed, but other necessary muscles are too far behind.</p>
<p>Many field event athletes are also like this. When throwing, they only rely on the strength of their arms and do not use the power of body extension and twisting. As a result, when they throw, their body retracts, and their feet change position too early. Some coaches also think that the most important component for throwing power is the legs. While the legs are indeed a very important component in this sport, they are not the most important component. In fact, when throwing a shot put or discus with the left hand, most of the power comes from the body's twisting motion to the left.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only athletes but even coaches must have a deep and systematic understanding of this sport. The most important thing in training track and field athletes is basic training. The so-called basic refers to muscle development, body balance, and coordinated movements. Regarding muscle development, one should focus on the necessary muscles and also ensure the body's average development. To establish a solid foundation, one must proceed step-by-step and not be impatient. It also requires perseverance and a strong will. Many athletes try to break their existing records every time they practice, believing that this is the only way to make rapid progress. At present, their views may not seem to have any flaws, but the result of practicing this way will be no hope of reaching the peak.</p>
<p>Due to limited space, I cannot introduce to all readers various exercises designed specifically to train the physique of track and field athletes. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will discuss them one by one. The effects of these exercises are threefold: (1) to develop muscles, adapting to the different needs of various sports; (2) to coordinate movements and balance the body; (3) to enable us to truly understand the principles of throwing, running, jumping, and other actions.

<h3>Is Studying Useful?</h3>
<p>— Fang Yu Yan</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>"As long as young people study, studying is saving the country," is the saying of those who advocate studying above all else.</p>
<p>"As long as young people save the country, there is no need to study," is the saying of those who generally believe that studying is useless.</p>
<p>In fact, both of these statements are biased and incorrect. Those who advocate studying above all else and say "studying is saving the country" are actually advocating national subjugation by encouraging young people to sit idly by and wait for the country to be conquered. We must take on the responsibility of eliminating the poison of this kind of national subjugation theory. Those who believe that studying is useless and say "saving the country requires no studying" are actually leading young people down the path of blind action and reckless behavior, which would harm the country. We must rise up as a group and correct this erroneous argument.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Our argument is to USE books, not to read books to death, to die while reading books, or to read dead books. Books are a useful tool—they enable people to receive the cultural experience of humanity, making people's minds clear and their thinking correct. They are a tool for guiding oneself forward and for guiding the masses forward. We must use whatever books are needed for whatever tasks we are doing. We use books to solve problems, and we use books to create undertakings. In the current stage, we must use books to resist the war and build the country. In other words, books are our great assistants and guides. They can help and guide us to see every problem more clearly, to know more correctly, and to arrive at a more correct solution. They can help and guide us to obtain more and better methods for every undertaking, and to be able to improve the things we are doing and the undertakings we are creating to be even better, with a more progressive future and a more promising future. They can help and guide us to know more details about the grand plan of resisting the war and building the country, to grasp it more firmly and correctly, and to make our belief in the final victory more firm, so that the final victory can come sooner. Therefore, what we use are: books that guide the advancement of life, books that guide the creation of undertakings, books that guide the resistance war and the building of the country, and books that guide the solution of problems. The more we use them in a practical way, the more progress our lives will make, the more confident we will be in solving problems, the more progress our undertakings will make, and the more powerful the resistance war and the building of the country will be able to generate in order to achieve the goal of resisting the war and winning for sure, and of building the country for sure. Come, let's all use books, let's use useful books, and let's oppose reading dead books. Let's oppose reading useless books. Let's all become active in using useful books!</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Therefore, libraries are the treasure house of modern knowledge, the lighthouse that guides modern youth in establishing themselves, cultivating themselves, and conducting themselves in the world. They are the great source that drives the progress of modern social culture. We must use the strength of all the men and women of society to enrich this treasure house, illuminate this lighthouse, and increase and expand this source, so that it becomes increasingly rich, increasingly bright, and increasingly increased and expanded, and becomes a great driving force for social evolution. This is of course a great driving force that charitable people in society are willing to increase and cultivate.</p>
<p>If you can buy us a two-cent or five-cent ticket, or a one-yuan, two-yuan, or five-yuan ticket, it will be a contribution to our library, and we will welcome and thank you. If you can donate books worth more than one, twenty, fifty, or one hundred yuan to us, we will be even more grateful and welcome you, and will respectfully present you with a "Honorary Ticket" for a seat. Donors of books worth more than one hundred yuan will have their names inscribed in the library to leave a permanent memorial.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm and loyalty of our teachers and students in doing things, and our honesty, will be seen by the people of society. However, our ability to do things and our experience are very limited, and we sincerely hope that advanced people in society will not hesitate to give us guidance and give us more and better guidance and support, then we will be extremely honored. (This article was written for the Chinese Amateur School, which held a drama and song gathering to establish a public library.)</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Reading History</h3>
<p>— Xiangfei</p>
<p>There are many precedents in history of borrowing foreign force to quell internal strife. The most famous is probably Wu Sangui's leading the Qing troops into the pass. Although his motive was nothing more than "angering over a beauty with a simple crown," later generations did not hesitate to give him the label of "traitor."</p>
<p>When Li Zicheng invaded Beijing and forced Emperor Chongzhen to his death, it was a time of national chaos. The Qing people took advantage of the opportunity to hold a funeral for the Ming emperor and empress, ordering officials and civilians to mourn for three days, which at the time was quite "grateful and virtuous" for some people, right? Later, Ma Shiying, the governor of Fengyang, supported Prince Fu Zhu Yujian to ascend the throne in Nanjing, and Shi Kefa even received a reprimand from a Qing general: something like "The law of the Spring and Autumn Annals: If there are bandits who are not punished, then the new emperor cannot be written as having ascended the throne." This led Shi Kefa to dig out historical facts of revival from history to resolve the suspicion of establishing himself; and he also skillfully explained: "We respectfully treated the troops in August, and sent envoys to reward the army; and also wanted to ask for orders, and join forces to attack the west: therefore, the royal army has already set out, and then proceeded to the Jianghuai area." At that time, Shi Kefa did not want to propose a "peace plan," but only blamed him with righteousness: "Your country drove out the rebellious bandits, and the army moved with righteousness; if you plan this territory, it would be an incomplete virtue: therefore, if righteousness begins and ends with profit, it will be laughed at by the bandits!"</p>
<p>In fact, saying that the Qing soldiers were a "righteous army" was originally a helpless act: the ultimate goal of the Qing soldiers was to seize the "national treasures." The so-called righteous army punishing bandits was just a facade. How could Shi Kefa not understand?</p>
<p>Is history really cyclical? Now, there are still people who want to be Wu Sangui, "stationing troops in Inner Mongolia," "jointly preventing communism," again using the old trick of the Manchus destroying the Ming.</p>
<p>Now there is no "rebellious banditry" of Li Zicheng in the country at all—randomly grabbing a party and taking it as "rebellious banditry" is either blind or has ulterior motives. The × people are quite familiar with Chinese history, and know that to deceive modern "Wu Sanguis," it is necessary to first create an atmosphere of "rebellious banditry." "Jointly preventing communism" is just the deceptive rhetoric of the × people. What is strange is that there are actually fools who take the bait!</p>
<p>Wu Sangui's plea for Qing soldiers was "angering over a beauty with a simple crown." Although it is killable to be a traitor for such a trivial matter, tracing his motive, it was only a temporary confusion. What about the modern "Wu Sangui"? Even the yellow-faced woman by the bedside came out to plan for him. The reason for such a trivial matter is untenable, so it is only for "official addiction."</p>
<p>Wasn't Wu Sangui also the Prince of Pingxi? As a result, there was a rebellion of the Three Feudatories, and he did not die well—the modern "Wu Sangui" should learn from others not to repeat history!</p>
<h3>Words That Make Sense</h3>
<p>— Ziyou</p>
<p>Everyone can say this reasoning, as long as your eloquence is a bit better, the reasoning will become an article. When I was taking composition class in childhood, the teacher said, "Everyone's opinions are different, as long as the writing is fluent and can make sense, it is a good work."; Later, when I was studying in university, the professors also said, "Learning is nothing else, as long as you can justify yourself, you can become an independent thinker." Thinking about it carefully, it is indeed reasonable. Otherwise, strange and bizarre theories and arguments would not exist.</p>
<p>Ilich once said, "In the extremely complex phenomena of social life, we can always find any number of examples or facts to prove any point of view." Proof of the defeatist theory, quick victory theory, compromise theory, and all the books and publications of national traitors since the War of Resistance are the best examples.</p>
<p>Wang's betrayal of the party and the country, absurd statements, and begging for surrender through × have become a foregone conclusion. But he wears colored glasses himself, and looks at Wang's private newspaper as someone with color. But today a "our serious protest," tomorrow a "our position," repeatedly defending Wang, such a great reasoning, perhaps some people in Hong Kong think they "make sense!" Traitor theory is often "words that make sense," like poison coated with sugar. We must raise our vigilance against traitor theories; constantly, extensively, refute incorrect theories.</p>
<p>The reason why words can make sense is of course related to the lack of understanding of those who are confused, but the main thing is that the "words" are creating trouble. Because only "words" are required to be "reasonable," facts are disregarded; only one side of the issue is mentioned, and not its entirety. This is the root cause of incorrect theories. But in any case, it cannot escape the palm of Mr. Reality. As long as you use facts to verify, Wang's "loyalty to the country, bright and upright, openly building a building to the government" turns out to be secretly betraying the country and openly begging for mercy from our nation's × people. The so-called "taking the independent survival of the country and nation and the independent integrity of territorial sovereignty as the principle of conducting peace talks" is to allow × people to live and station troops freely in our country, to give the four northeastern provinces to the × people, to put the lifeblood of the nation - economic power in the hands of the × people; to put it bluntly, it is to surrender under the conditions of national subjugation. Leaving aside the many guerrilla teams that are attacking back and forth, only talking about a small part of the "bandits" who are wandering around (most of whom were bought by the × people), of course, can only get the absurd theory that the guerrillas are useless. Not talking about the progress of the War of Resistance, first circling around the bad things, the War of Resistance is of course one benefit with a hundred harms. But the eloquent Mr., if you act according to your wishes, the fact is that you are handing over China to Japan with both hands. What we want is not beautiful words and writing!</p>
<p>I think, if we don't talk about reasoning, then that's it, but if we want to talk about it, we have to find out the development and key points of the entire objective situation, and seize the facts to speak.</p>
<h3>The Distance Between Two Eras</h3>
<p>— Mengqi</p>
<p>Until I graduated from school and went to work, I asked my father about this matter once. Father said:</p>
<p>"Children have things they should do, and things they cannot do. If things you cannot do make you aware and worry, it will delay the things you should do."</p>
<p>At the time, I didn't understand the benefits of these words. It wasn't until I became a father myself that I deeply realized that these words accurately explained the basic attitude of being a father.</p>
<p>I don't need to hide it. Father has many shortcomings. In thought and action, Father Gui is a figure from the old world. His individualism is very strong, and his personality is also very strong. In the training of his son, he always had the idea of "like me, like me." Due to the different education and sense of the times, many cracks gradually appeared in my thoughts and those of my father. Not insignificant conflicts occurred. For a time, my father simply ignored me, and my heart was also filled with contempt and resentment towards my father. If it hadn't been for my mother's tears moistening everyone's feelings, a break-up would have been very possible for a time. Coincidentally, under the low pressure in the family, I had something to do in a very remote place. Parting and forgetting eased the dispute between us. First, the old man couldn't stand the loneliness and wrote a long letter full of emotion, which turned my resentment against my father into self-blame. After that, we never mentioned the past again, until I had been away for several years and returned to my hometown. At this time, everyone was calm, and one day, we just talked about the past as if it were "research" data. Father said earnestly:</p>
<p>"I was wrong that time. I only saw my own world and didn't see your world. My world is already old. Although I don't understand what your world is like, I think it should be to replace the old with the new..."</p>
<p>Father's cheerfulness and joy forced out my remorseful tears.</p>
<p>Last year, I had something to do in Guangdong. Father helped me pack my luggage with great excitement. It was very hot at that time. Father's body was fat and his movements were really difficult. Mother advised him not to do it, and he almost got angry, saying that as long as it was something he liked to do, it wouldn't matter if it was hot. Mother had no choice but to follow him and fan him. Father wiped off the soybean-sized sweat beads and folded my clothes one by one according to the time of year, telling me which clothes were on the bottom layer and which clothes were on the top layer, and which suits were suitable for wearing in the south at what time of year. At that time, I was only staring at the sweat beads on his forehead in a daze, and I didn't pay much attention to what he said. After everything was arranged, Father insisted on taking me to the boat, saying that I was not careful in doing things and that he had to take care of it himself—in fact, I had already "gone out" several times before. When I arrived in Shanghai, because the ship was delayed, after my repeated persuasion, Father agreed to go home first. It's really strange. I've been running around and rarely at home, but only this time, before I left, my father was very reluctant to leave, and he repeatedly told me about trivial matters such as diet and daily life. At the moment when I was about to get on the car, he was simply crying and couldn't look up; if it hadn't been for "self-restraint," I would have wanted to hug the old man warmly at that time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Division Between Civilization and Savagery</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>According to a boast by a Japanese soldier, the level of knowledge of Japanese soldiers is far higher than that of Chinese soldiers when comparing the soldiers of the two countries, China and Japan. Thereupon, a "rear-area" writer immediately wrote an article, asserting that China is a barbaric country with low culture and citing the words of a celebrity, saying that famous generals have never come from among barbarians, but from among cultured people.</p>
<p>Next, in order to show his "writer's" "fair" attitude, he also said that we cannot deny the robustness of wildness while proving the strength of civilized people. Because ancient history often shows that many civilized countries have been conquered or threatened by barbarians. For example, ancient Persia, with its high degree of civilization, was often invaded by barbarians. The central plains cultural area of China was often harassed by the Yi and Di tribes, and was even conquered several times. Moreover, he determined that the proletariat's attempt to "conquer" the bourgeoisie is nothing more than a delusional hope for victory from a lower level of culture.</p>
<p>However, the final victory in the battle between barbarism and civilization will inevitably still belong to civilization, even this "rear-area" writer admits. It is said that the struggle between ancient Sparta and Athens is the best example. Although Sparta's military power was strong for a time, in the end, Sparta was destroyed, while the civilization of Athens still exists in the world today.</p>
<p>If today's Japan is the "civilized" Athens, and China is the "barbaric" Sparta, I wonder if this "writer" has the courage to admit it? When he picks up his pen, he wants to slap others in the face, but every time he slaps his own!</p>
<p>Aggression is a barbaric act, even Hitler and Mussolini said so. Our "rear-area" writer is a supporter of the Berlin-Rome Axis. Naturally, he does not dare to be innovative. In fact, a truth that has long been universally recognized, no matter how cunning you are, is inconvenient to deny. However, the ambition of the aggressor will never stop his aggressive actions simply because such a truth exists. Therefore, he can only make a misattribution and play a trick, insisting that the aggressor is the aggressed, and that the aggressed is the aggressor. Although this strategy of inverting right and wrong is a passive strategy, after all, because of its "barbarism," it can no longer think of a "civilized" strategy.</p>
<p>To argue today about who is the aggressor between China and Japan is simply idiotic nonsense. The League of Nations, which brings together the world's civilized countries, has already determined who is the aggressor for us, and world opinion has long unanimously exposed the true face of the aggressor without any concealment. However, because the "barbaric" weapons are still in the hands of the aggressor, although the theorem of right and wrong has been separated, we still have to use our own blood and flesh to prove the truth of this theorem.</p>
<p>In terms of common-sense knowledge, perhaps the military technical knowledge of Japanese soldiers is stronger than that of Chinese soldiers. This is because Japan has this kind of military technical equipment. If China also had this kind of highly technical equipment, then the knowledge of Chinese soldiers in this area would certainly not be inferior to that of Japan. As for knowledge from the perspective of truth, the "cultural nature" of Japanese soldiers is most clearly expressed in the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities. Take a look at Amejels Veapa, a spy, to see how much difference there is between the "cultural nature" in the mouths of Japanese soldiers and the "tacit nature" of barbarians.</p>
<p>It is true that famous generals come from among cultured people, such as the current supreme commander of China and his subordinates. As for the fact that the commanders of Japan have been changed and transferred during the sixteen months of the Sino-Japanese War (and are now undergoing major changes), this is enough to show their fluster. The ugly state of so-called "famous generals" has been completely exposed. A schemer like Doihara is the epitome of a Japanese "famous general," cruel and tyrannical, greedy, lacking rationality, all of which is the nature of Japanese soldiers!</p>
<p>The division between the civilization and savagery of a nation is determined by its sense of justice and its practice. This interpretation also applies to the division between the civilization and wildness of the Sino-Japanese War. All distortions and concealments will never escape the demon-revealing mirror of truth.</p>
