<p>社評</p>
<h3>揭破誘降的黑幕　中國不是捷克西班牙！</h3>
<p>抗戰轉向第二階段以來，五個月之間，×人對華政策，時而運用政治的和平誘降，時而又作軍事的冒險，大有『舉棋不定』之勢，一般昧於大勢的人，亦多爲之迷惑。其實×人所以加此，原因很簡單，即是中日戰爭二十個月以來，我國內外形勢日趨進步，日趨好轉，日本內外形勢則恰恰相反，速戰速决旣不可能，速和速决陰謀亦告失敗，於是其行動乃狼狽周章，似乎不堪究詰。但我們如果能够平心靜氣地加以觀察，則可知×之困難雖在加深，而尙未加深到使侵略營壘整個崩潰的程度，而尙未加深到喪失繼續進攻的力量；我方力量確有進步，亦尙未進步到足以完全制止×人進攻達到收同失地的程度。因此，×人目前一面用軍事冒險來作政治陰謀的後盾，一面用和平誘降來補助軍事力量的不足，所以，他的「戰固然是冒險，他的「和」亦毫無誠意，他的目的厥在阻止我國政治進步，消滅我國抗戰的力量，實現整個的「降服中國」！「和平」「妥協」「國際調解」等等烟慕，就在日×這種形勢之下爲上述征服中國的企圖而不斷的散放出來。這幾天×人漢奸又在連放這種煙慕，目的亦在乎此。這是我們應有的基本內認識。</p>
<p>「和平」『妥協『國際調解』等等誘降毒計，顯然是脫胎於德意兩國滅亡捷克與『征服』西班牙最新事實的。因此；一般人雖巳明知×人漢奸的陰謀毒計，但亦深慮中國今後恐難免不幸而蹈捷克或西班牙的覆轍，於是『新的慕尼黑！』和『遠東的慕尼黑！』的警號，便不斷的呼喊出來。我們今日的確應該提髙警惕性，防制慕尼黑的人類醜劇之在遠東搬演出來。但同時我們仍應明瞭，任何一種要淪中國爲捷克或西班牙第二的陰謀，都是不可能的，都是徒勞的。爲什麽呢？我　可以略加解說如次：</p>
<p>首先，我們知道捷克原無滅亡之理的，因爲他們在政治上有偉大的民主傳統，全國人民擁護政府反抗侵略，他在軍事上又有相當雄厚的軍隊和鞏固國防建設。然而捷克爲何終於滅亡呢？這是由於捷克內部的團結不够，保衞民主的力量互相猜忌，並且有一部份公然親敵（德），敵人又在捷克境內扶植漢倫等叛黨，從內部搗亂；同時國際關係上，雖有法蘇互助公約，但法國旣受英國牽制，放棄援捷，英國且派任錫曼壓迫捷克屈服，蘇聯亦以捷克中途進行妥協，終於未加抗戰，因而無從援助。這是捷克滅亡的因素。現在中國巳經具備比捷克更多的不會滅亡的條件，但是沒有捷克所以亡國的任何因素，主要的：是我們內部的團結日趨鞏固，猜忌磨擦的現象己近消滅，一部份親×（日）的份子己經淸除，潛伏的親×的份子稍一蠢動卽遭舉國一致的打擊，漢倫等叛黨亦從未產生，而國際關係上，則不僅沒有公然壓迫我國屈服的強國，並且具有堅决援華抗日的蘇聯，以至英美法各國，和全世界廣大的和平正義人士！</p>
<p>其次，我們來看西班牙看西班牙是比捷克更無被征服的理由的。因爲西班牙巳經抗戰了三十個月以上，全國人民一致擁護共和政府抗戰到底，全國各黨派亦巳樹立鞏固團結的統一戰綫，並且獲得全世界人民的同情援助。然而西班牙抗戰爲何又終於慘遭破壞？而全西班牙竟至「被征服」在德意侵略者的鷹犬佛朗哥政權之下呢？這是由於西班牙的敵人，不祗是叛徒佛朗哥的軍隊，而有德意兩大侵略國家合力的進攻，且佛朗哥的乒力一開始卽已奪去政府正規軍的十份之七八，怎禁得又加上數十萬的德意精銳的部隊和最新式的武器！同時，英法統治者很早就已以不干涉政策壓迫共和軍，阻絕共和軍的外援，而德意則可陸續援助佛朗哥，最後還竭力破壤西班牙的人民陣綫，不斷挑撥政變以破壞共和政府。最後終因國際壓迫力量過大，共和政府少數領袖是加沙陀米亞加的叛變，實行反共議和，才有最近「被征服」的慘劇出現。反之在我國，從國內情勢說，我們地大，物博，人衆，實爲遠勝于捷西兩國，而爲我决不能滅亡的主要條件，其次，我國抗戰廿多個月以來，國內團結日益鞏固，政治日益進步，經濟日益發展，軍隊繼續保持二百多萬，而且日益壯大，新軍又在大量培植起來！我們的統一戰綫，包括全國各黨派各少數民族，尢其是包括各階層，領導統一戰綫的黨又以十年的經騐而確定了長期的親密合作，這些勝利條件不僅優於捷克，並且優於西班牙。從國際形勢說，一方面因爲英法從切身利害着想，不僅不能加我以如對捷西的壓迫，並且採取積極援助的方針，另一方面則蘇聯援華，亦以地理與政治關係而大爲便利，且有持久的保障，這也，捷西兩國所未備的勝利條件。此外我們×人的力量，還不及德意兩國合作進攻捷西兩國的力量，中國的叛徒漢奸亦莫能望漢倫的項背，更遠不及佛朗哥力量的萬一；這些都是我們决不會作克或西班牙的主要條件。</p>
<p>我們從上面種種具體條件的對比中，已經明瞭，縱使×奸加緊種種誘降的陰謀步驟，企圖變我國爲捷克或西班牙第二，事實上將爲絕不可能。然而我　不是說，我們因此就可放任×好這種誘降的陰謀毒計的横行，不！我們如果放任，如果不予以澈底的致命的打擊，則我們抗戰前途，民族解放運動前途，必將遭遇種種意外的障礙旗苦痛！特別是有如本文首段所述，我們軍事上政治上的進攻還不够制止×人的進攻的必要程度，因此我們縱使已經可以斷言堅持團結抗戰結果終必勝利，而我們在這過程中所受的苦難的廣大嚴重與慘酷，將是我們所不忍想像！我們今日果將如何予×奸誘降陰謀以澈底他致命的打擊呢？這是我們一再祈望的，我們在軍事上要增強前綫戰鬥力擴大×後游擊戰，而最重要的則是在政治上實現民主政治，改善民衆生活，以便切實實現全民族精神與物質力量的總動員。</p>
<h3>社會主義國家的兒童　——為紀念今年的兒童節而作——</h3>
<p>— 梅眞</p>
<p>抗戰建國已經進入新的階段，我們在這新階段中紀念『兒童節』，覺得具有異常重要的新的意義，我們必須努力救　戰區及流浪各地的受難兒童，我們必須努力保育我們全國各地的兒棄，保育未來新中國的主人。本報經於四月一日提前發表淑芬君的『保育新中國的主人』一文，解决我們要怎樣紀念今年的兒童節的問題。今天特再發表梅眞君此文，描寫兒童在社會主義革命成功後的蘇聯的生活情形，及其政府對于兒童婦女生活的保障辦法，一方面可以作爲我們今日注意兒童問題者的參效，另一方面大可增加我們革命鬥爭的勇氣與决心，特爲讀者介紹。</p>
<p>一　革命成功後的蘇聯兒童</p>
<p>『十月的社會主義革命』的成功，奠定了消滅人剝削人階級壓迫階級的社會制度的基礎，也奠定了婦婦完全的和最後的解放的基礎。接着第一第二兩個五年計劃順利完全，便完全實以人剝削人的針會制度的消滅，便完全實現了無階級的社會生活。　聯社會主義建設完全成功了！革命成功以後出世的蘇聯的兒童，今日蘇聯的少年，他們　已完全在幸福的社會主滿社會中滋生壯大，一切人壓迫人與人剝削人的制度，以及我們生活在資本主義和半封建件半殖民地性的社會裏所常　身受的欺　侮辱，壓榨殘殺，階級鬥爭的現象，在蘇聯的兒童與少年，是祗能從報紙上看到，因而幻想其殘酷，因而義憤塡膺，以表示其爲勤勞大衆大嗚不平而已！</p>
<p>蘇聯的兒童，幸福地滋長在社會主義社會中的兒童，他們幸福的生活，簡直不是資本主義國家所能想象二更不是半封建的半殖民地的中國兒黨所能夢想得的。他們還在母親　內之時，就巳享受社會主義的蘇維埃政府的法律的保護，受到和資本主義與封建國家性買完全不同的禁止打胎法令的保護。當他們一離母胎，不僅早已獲得男女在一切政冶上社會上和家庭生活上完全平等的法律的保護，並目立即獲得蘇維埃政府獎勵兒童撫養補助條例的保護。這種政府法律的保護，不僅對於兒童，而且實際地惠及兒童的父母尤其是母親。她們可以護得政府特別的優待。</p>
<p>蘇聯兒童從出娘胎　後，立刻可以享受托兒所，淮而幼稚園。進而各級學校，一切政府專門設備的優待，不用費兒童的父母的心。同時他們依然享受家庭的幸福，他們在晚上在假日，依然享受着家庭的温暖。不過他們除了家庭幸福以外，更可誇耀的是集體的更大範圍的幸福，此外，他們還享受着爲資本主義與封建邦國的意想不到的種種娛樂。形式內容都是革命化的充滿未來之理想而又絕非幻想的各種舞蹈，戲劇，電影，以至全世界第一位的體育，和潸翔，降落傘等游戲，這種游戲幾乎是資本主義靑年所渴幕不到，更爲我們中國靑年以至軍官們所渴慕不到的，然而在蘇聯己經成爲一般兒童的游戲了！</p>
<p>蘇聯兒童是那麽幸福的生活着，一直到他們進入成人時期，同時，他們絕對不是當做小鳥兒小蝴蝶兒那麽玩具樣的愛護，不，他們同時又是具備着其他資本主義及一切國家所求前見的獨立的人格，他們雖然被社會主翁的敎育誘導着走向爲保衞社會主義爲保衛人類文化進步大路，但是他們同時獲得人性的自然的發展，無論在日常生活中在游戲娛樂中以至一切社會服務中，他們有充分的機會發揮其自動性積極性和削造性。</p>
<p>直到他們進入成人期，他們都能繼績發　其對於人生對於政治對於社會的自動性積極性和創造性。不過那時他們除了獲得政府賦予的政治民主等自由以外，更換得資本主義國家和具他國家人民所享受不到的，眞正男女平等的，沒有階級的，物質生活條件的一律改善，工作時間的減少，醫務的發速和文化娛樂的增加！</p>
<p>特別是他們從幼兒時代起，就被敎育着而且凖備着，爲保衞社會主義祖國，為保衛全世界被壓迫大衆的利益，為保衛弱小民族的解放，爲保衛世界和平與人類文化淮步而鬥爭。</p>
<p>（二）蘇聯保護婦女與兒童的法律</p>
<p>蘇聯保護婦女與兒童的法律，首先要說到的是禁止墮胎的法律。</p>
<p>在內戰和國際武裝干涉以後的幾年裏面，蘇聯國內經　崩潰，婦女由革命以前時　承襲來的不充分的文化水準，使她們不能立時充分地利用法律所給與她們的權利，也使她們不能毫不担心般來地，立時負起生產和教育子女的，做公民和做母親的任務。當時只要符合衛生興司法人民委員會一九二〇年十一月十八日决讓所指「過去的道德遺產和現在的困難的經濟狀况仍舊迫令一部份婦女訴　這個手術」的情形，就准許婦女的墮胎行爲。</p>
<p>蘇聯的革命領袖是堅决反對墮胎行爲的列寧曾於一九一三年答文，述及有階級意識的工人『爲新馬爾薩斯主義的無疑的×人。這個主義見怯懦自却的愚夫愚婦的意向，他們悚然獸禮着：「但願上帝使我們的肉體和心靈常在一起。至於子女，最好是沒有。』不過外寧雖把墮胎行爲當作社會的罪惡，同時却說明：任何立法禁止墮胎，顯然不會生效。他還指出：在資本主義的情形之下，禁止墮胎的法律僅反映出「統治階級的僞善」，因爲這些法律「並不能盤治資本主義的膿瘡，却反使它變成特殊的惡性，變成　壓迫階級的特殊的創痛」。只有在社會主義的情形之下，剝削人的現象己不存在，婦女巳成爲社會的平等人員，同時答動者物質福利的改善已經構成了社會發展的法律——以法律或其他手段來嚴正地組織反對墮胎的鬥爭，才有可能。</p>
<p>衞生司法兩人民委會一九二〇年十一月十八日准許墮胎的决議案終被修正了。而且進一步，一方面實現了婦女和她們子女的必要物質貯備，實現了對大家庭的補助，產室網托兒所網和幼稚園網的極度發展，以及夫婦分居後父親所必須付的最低限額的子女撫養贊的明令規定，另一方面，實行禁止墮胎，加重故意不付法庭所判定的子女撫養費的刑律，以及提出在離婚時的立法上的某幾種修正案，他們這樣　决地反對那些以家庭及家庭義務爲兒戲的態度！這些，都是有關全人口的軍要問題所必浪遵行的道路。蘇維埃政府　應了許多勤勞婦女所提出的籲願。</p>
<p>首先，關於禁止墮胎，蘇聯中執委會和人民委員會於一九三六年六日廿七日决定了如下的法案：（一）於已被證實的危害，兩委會决定嚴禁墮胎的行爲，無論在醫院中和特種衞生機關中，或在醫生的家中和孕婦的私宇中。惟在身孕危及生命或有傷及孕婦健康之慮時，以及在父母的重病能這傳給胎兒時，墮胎行爲可激特許，但必須在醫院或產室中執行。（二）若在　院外或醫院人有違犯以上的墮胎行爲，執行墮胎的醫生當受一年以上二年以下的徒刑，若墮胎的行爲在不合衛生的情形下毫無特種醫藥敎育的人執行，當處以三年以上的徒刑。（三）若强迫婦女墮胎，當處以二年的徒刑。（四）對於遂禁墮胎的孕婦，兩委員會規定的社會的非難代替刑律，如有再犯，當科以三百膚布以下的罰金。</p>
<p>其次關於保護產婦將勵生育，兩委員會決定了如下的法案：（一）爲要改善那些在社會保險機關中保險的婦女（女工和女僱員）的物質地位，兩委會决定把那個從國家的社會保險基金中支出準備育嬰必需的津貼，從三二盧布增至四五盧布。（二）兩委會决定把發給母親的哺乳津貼從每月五盧布增加到一〇盧布。（三）關於未保險的勞動婦女（合作組合和合作企業的會員）規定上述津點由合作互助基會在同等的基礎上發給。（四）取消勞動法典所加於女僱員的限制，使她們在產前產後假期的長短上和勞動婦女一律平等（產前五十六天，產後五，六天，（五）制定拒絕僱用孕婦和减低孕婦工資的刑律，幷在法律規定，在調爭婦做輕便工作之時，價主有　持她最近六個月內工作所得的原有工資的義務。（六）制定對于大家庭的母親的國家津貼，巳有六個孩子的母親，以後每生一個孩子，得每年領受二千　布的津貼，至孩子生後五年爲止。巳有十個孩子的母親，以後每生一個孩子，得一次領受五千盧布的國家津貼，再每年領受三千盧布的津貼，至孩子生後四年爲止，（一盧布台港幣一元左右）</p>
<p>三　蘇聯怎樣愛護小孩子們</p>
<p>蘇聯的孩子們從出娘胎時起除了父母哥哥姐姊的愛撫以外，就受到政府法律的愛護。如遍佈全國的產室網啦，託兒所網啦，幼稚園網啦，莫不由政府接受人民的要求而週到地佈置好了。</p>
<p>前述的兩個委員會，同時訓令全聯邦各共和國的衞生人民委員會執行下列工作：（一）爲供給一切在都市中　業中心和地方中心的婦女，以特種產室中的醫夢扶助。各衞生人民委會應於一九三九年一月一日以前。設一萬　千個新的產牀。（二）爲擴充對員村產婦的醫藥服務，各漸生人民香會應設置並啟用三萬二千個產牀（三）爲供給那些不進產科醫院的婦女以在家中的助產服務，各衛生人民委會應於一九三八年一月一日以前，開辦一萬四千所新的接生醫生站。以上是關於柑廣產室網的。其次關於推廣託兒所的，（一）兩委會决于一九三九年一月一日以前，把城市中，國營農塲中，工人區中，以及鐵道上的現有的育嬰牀網擴充到兩倍，牀位總數增達八十萬個。（二）同上日期前，把農村中經產集體農場託兒所和時令集體農場託兒所中現有的育嬰牀網擴充兩倍，使經常託兒所中的牀位增加五十萬個，時令託兒所中牀位增加四十萬個。（三）在都市和工業中心區，自一九三七年元旦起，託兒所學校的工作由兩班人員輪值。（四）在中間性的　　人員的訓練費外再撥一千五百萬盧布，訓令聯邦各共和國的衛生人民委會爲新設的機關造就適當的人材。（五）各共和以衛委會於一九三九年元旦前，在都市中，產業中心和地方中心中，添設八百所新的奶廚，以哺育一百五十萬三歲以下的兒童。再次關於擴充幼稚園的，蘇聯在一三六至三八年，完成了以下計劃：（一）把都市中，工廠區中。和鐵道上的現有的經常幼惟園網擴充達三倍，在一九三八年元旦前增加到二百十萬個學額；在鄕區的國營農場和國營機關中，增達三十萬个學額（二）一九三六年之元旦前，於舊有四十萬个學額外，冉在集體農場上添設有七十萬個畢額的幼稚園，並在同時間內爲集體場上一切未屆入學年齡的兒童設立時令運動場。建立了二千三百萬個地位。各共和國敎　委會，於一九三六年下半年，即爲那些將開辦的幼稚園訓練了五萬个教師，僅這半年，又額外撥給三千五百萬盧布以充作新幼稚園訓練幹部的經費。</p>
<p>又蘇聯為減輕兒女衆多的母親的負担，曾給與這些母親以大量津貼，到一九三七午四月一日止，巳領到津貼的母親有二十十萬人，共計五萬萬六千六百萬盧布。此外婦科兒科醫室及嬰兒幼童保護室，革命前至一九一一年，尙祇有九所，可是到一九三五年，前者已有三千九百四十五所，受診者三千四百。萬人，後者七百九十四所，受診者亦達一千七百萬人！這些機　內都具備精美　騐室，愛克司光和其他進步的醫療器械。</p>
<p>四　蘇聯兒童的文化局生活與娛樂</p>
<p>蘇聯兒童的文化生活和娛樂生活，都是可以向資本主義的世界誇耀的。蘇聯專爲兒童辦的學校數量，就值得注意。在革命前，初級學　僅有十萬三千所，學生為七百萬，不完全中學一千六百所，學生二十萬人，中學一千八百所，學生六十萬人。以上數年後，在一九三五至三六年，初級學校已有十二萬六千六百所，學生有一千一百萬人，不完全中學三萬一千五百所，學生一千萬人，中學六千所寧生四百五十萬人。此外還有七百多所工人講習院，授以中等敎育，內有學生二十五萬人，而在一九三六至三七年中小學校學生　增至二千八百八十四萬二千人。現在第二個五年計劃完成，第三個五年計劃開始，更注力於物質及文化生活水準的提髙，數量又當增數倍。蘇聯各學校學生入學是完全免費，學校槪由國家設立，有些中小學校學生還由學校津貼午飯，專門畢校及大學的學生都不付學費，還領津貼。而女子受敎育的機會也已到了平等地位，例如一九三　年中各中小學校女生上佔總數的百分之四十八了。</p>
<p>俄國向付貧乏之名，但蘇俄的文化出版事業之發達，則成爲世人所不能置信。關於兒童方　也，少他們爲對兒童施行正確適當的敎育，專爲，童出版了各種文字的兒童書籍，雜誌電報等。兒童文學書在一九三四年就有一千零五十萬册，一九三五年爲一千六百四十萬册，一九三六年爲三千二百十萬册，兒童雜誌一三五年爲一千九百萬冊，一九三六年爲三千七萬册，兒童少年雜誌更有數百種。至於兒童新　紙，則幾於每一鎭，鄉，村，坊，以至小學校幼稚園，都有一種！</p>
<p>說到蘇聯兒童的娛樂生活，那是更有趣味了，蘇聯對下兒童，設有專門戲院及電影院馬戲院等。爲在戲劇方面於兒童以正確的敎育，普通成戲院，多數不接受兒童也，在一九三六年底就有了一百個普通戲院和馬院是專屬於兒童及靑年。此外在街市及有森林的地方，設有兒童花園，公園內都有兒童設備，如游玩具圖書館動物園等。特別是冬季，兒童參加滑冰滑。簡直是每個兒童的日　娛樂。在莫斯科列寧城哈亦可夫城等，還設有兒軍宮，設備特爲完善，以啟發兒童硏究本國及國際各種科，的興趣，羅致天才兒童以發揮其天才，這種兒童宮目　正在各都市各集體　場普遍增闢中。至於夏天，兒童有二个月的休假　絕大多數的兒童，在夏季要離開城市到郊外去居住，受大自然的鍛鍊，有。全國學習　的兒童。（突擊隊員）還有　選去，俄海邊奧爾特克地方的兒童營休養兩月，這　兒童集體修養　所規模較大設備完善的場所之一，一切兒重，連往來旅費，衣服等都是不　自備，那裏每天七時升旗，每天三次正餐，三次茶點，午飯後規定　眠　小時，每日須作游泳，日光浴，其餘時間則就各個兒童有興趣的科學專門研究，採取各種動植物製成標本，研究作飛機，架坦克，或作旅行中短途旅行　，　有的兒童還作出　關機器的發明。他們有各種專門指導員在指導他們，當個人持　是團　去他們那裏去參觀時，他們莫不殷勤招待，茶點之後，他羣集起來作歌詠，舞蹈等表演。他們在休義中，還互相競賽增如體重。休養成　好的也得獎。</p>
<p>（五）外國兒童在蘇聯生活</p>
<p>『你也想到蘇聯去嗎？』母一國家的兒童，當說到蘇聯兒童生活之時，沒有不想到這紅色的蘇聯去的。事實上，全世界也沒有冉像蘇聯這樣歡仰外國兒童去旅行的了！何况蘇聯本國，也就是七個社會主義共和國和其他許多自由邦的聯合，他們令國也有幾百種民埃呢！</p>
<p>西班牙共和國自從德　侵略者的鷹犬佛郞哥發種戰爭以來，兒童所遭德盧飛機轟炸刀槍殺戮的，正條我們中國今日所受的一樣，其他飢寒。流浪，死亡的更是千千萬萬！各民主和平國家，於前年發起救濟西國難童，社會主義國家的蘇聯，自然更加努力贊助，現在有十多萬的在西班牙受難兒童，已安然被接送到蘇，甚至有把整個學校都搬到蘇聯的，學校一切敎職員都是該校原來在西班牙聘就的，用西班牙語言文字進行西班牙原來的敎育，這種學校還很受蘇聯政府的特別優待。其餘的難童，蘇聯政府把他們組織起來，爲他們設立學校，大多數敎員也是西班牙人，敎材書籍也完全用西班牙語言的。蘇聯發給他們一色的　制服，又整齊，又美麗，還供給他們一切用品。有些兒童的父出還在西班牙鬥爭，他們可以用無綫電與父母接談，和他們的家庭聯絡如在國內一樣</p>
<p>此外，各國革命者留在蘇聯的兒童，也和蘇聯兒童一樣享受着各種權利，那裏還有中國　多革命家的兒童呢！他們都在國際革命者　濟　所設立的國際兒童托兒所和學校裏他們容顏雖有黑白棕黄紅的不同，然而他們　非　融洽和藹　相處。他們在　幸　的樂園裏畏得康健，活潑聰明，而撫養地們的機關，不僅切實注意他們的起居飲食學習娛樂，還盡使他們不忘祖國，經常敎育他們愛祖國，愛　他們祖國廣大的同胞與全世界的受難者。</p>
<p>我　抗戰以後，日本侵略者用飛機大砲的我們造成成千成萬的嬰屍童屍和成千成萬的孤兒，我們有廣大的後方，西南尤具是西北，我們的兒童不需要逃難的蘇聯去，然而蘇聯巳曾從精神上和醫藥募捐上，盡了他們的力量我們還有成百成千的優秀兒童和靑年，已經保送到蘇，學習專　的科學和飛機製造與駕駛等，我們在這要遙觀他們偉大的成功吧！</p>
<h3>成都揭開了建軍之幕（一）</h3>
<p>— 字飛</p>
<p>【成都特約航訊】三月五日的天氣，特別淸朗；很多天看不見太陽的成都人們，份外欣喜；尤其是在元宵佳節的一天。</p>
<p>金水河（成都市內之河）由浣花溪（金水河發源處）帶來了無數的微波，在城內緩緩的步着，潺潺的游着；逗引得那兩岸的踵柳，也睜開了倦眼，穿上一身柔綠色的新裝，迎人欲笑。『快樂呵！』『好玩極了！』吧，到處都有男女們喊着。的確，以『編犬吠日』的天氣，忽然萬里無雲的淸明，眞是有說不出的快樂。况且遭天又是元宵佳節，又是星期日，又是中華史上未曾寫過的『成都文化界建軍連動會傳週』呢。</p>
<p>當闊太太們，闊小姐們。避難的紳士和坐着求勝利快到的大佬們。還在追求甜夢的時候，街上有不住的鑼聲；隨着　聲傳到：『衆位街鄰，諸位街房！警察局命令，今天是　連宣傳周開幕的一天，家家戶戶，都要懸掛國旗，』語聲止後，又是</p>
<p>的網聲。</p>
<p>國旗　碭在每家的門口。笑顔　上各個人的窩。今天的成都市上與在日逈乎不同。通衢要路，都有横掛的各色布標語；不是寫：『建設陸軍一千萬，恢復河山』，便是寫『動員我們所有的力，供献國家』，，『人人當兵，抗戰必勝』，『個個出力，建國必成』，和『……』一切記不勝記的抗戰金句。人們爭先恐後的　向少城公園。國旗在春風怡蕩中，爭到了十分的自由。</p>
<p>建軍宣傳大會。是在少城公園舉行。</p>
<p>當人們走到祠當街口時，便看見一個極大的人形燈彩，張着血紅的口，他伸出一隻兩丈多長的胳臂，緊掃着拳頭。拳下沿着胳臂寫：『起來！不願做奴隸的人們。』令你看着，心中總要問問自已：「我是否在抗戰中起來？還是不起來？」横在率頭下邊有過街的紅色白字標語，寫着一建設飛機五千架，絮固國防』。正門是一點白布寫着黑字，「四川地　人多。出兵出糧，爲全國模範」的橫眉。右邊是空委政治部所繪的中華大地圖，上邊繪有各省各民族抗戰　力和動態，觀衆數百人昂首企足的瞻望着。　（未兜）</p>

<h3>綏遠×偽窘態</h3>
<p>— 高魯</p>
<p>【緩遠通訊】綏遠由于在西北國際地位的特殊，早爲日×覬覦，利用內蒙之于公及土匪做他侵略的工其和爪牙，從事政治分化，一九三六年×寇對綏遠侵略之加緊，我們的解放史上，才有傅作義將軍綏東抗戰之光榮一頁。我蘆溝橋烽烟燃後，除伊克昭盟及綏西一部，到現在還能成為國防上森嚴的壁壘而外，綏遠大部城市和交通綫——平漢路均爲×人魔手所控制，而演此幕殘酷的魔手戲的主角，是被人利誘和強制着的偽蒙軍，眞正的日本×子，不過在軍隊中居着監視地位的少數。</p>
<p>演至最近，巳成強弩之末，窘態百也了！</p>
<p>由於我在綏各正規軍游擊隊自衛軍的堅持抗戰和英勇搏戰，×人一年來都是困居危城，死守鉄路幹線，不敢越雷池一步。每出外活動，輙爲我游擊隊所擊。據包頭來人談，×偽軍在綏遠現在的分佈如下：</p>
<p>第一師——包頭麻池一帶，包括×偽軍岩田中隊和偽軍丁其昌部。</p>
<p>第二師第三師——分駐於陶林武川一帶。</p>
<p>第四師飽貴麻部——分岐于大雪灣，沙縣一帶</p>
<p>第五師色本部——分駐于固陽一帶。</p>
<p>第六師第七師——分駐於平地泉，豐鎮一帶。</p>
<p>第八師——分駐于淸水河一瀣。</p>
<p>第九師——駐于托縣。</p>
<p>防共自治軍于志謙部——駐于固陽一帶。</p>
<p>蒙偽軍曾一度盤据準格國旗，被挺進軍驅逐渡河，杭錦旗的偽蒙軍，也被綏遠的國民兵驅逐而去，當森蓋部進攻東勝時，我乘勝將偽義軍盡擊逐出達拉持旗，因而伊克昭盟各旗得無×偽軍的擾亂蹂躪和剝削。</p>
<p>×偽軍駐綏之部隊，號稱龐大之一師，實際均僅只有九六百人（日人和偽蒙軍都算起來）或三四百人，像包頭名義爲第一師，實際只有一個岩田中隊和丁其昌的四百多人。</p>
<p>尤于日×的深入內地，戰線愈延長，兵力不够分配。在綏遠的×軍對兵力分配，尤惑痛苦；每週激烈戰鬥，咸感顧首不能顧尾之概。因而存窘蹙的情况下，近將河東各零散匪隊，改編為西北自治軍。李逆兆興任師長，現駐于包蕯間之沙爾沁鄂爾遜，海岱，土合氣，把拉蓋，油房葱子等地。然而偽軍終究是中國人，時時刻刻在懷念着他的祖國，暗中醞釀反正，據跟從日本囘國來到榆的一個蒙占靑年談，偽軍中的靑年，都熱切地擊念祖國，德王部下問德王：「我怎樣辦呢？」而德王也白髮蒼蒼，受不住日人的壓迫。在这種情况下：日×異常相憂×人懷疑漢人軍官。除大量遺散外，井將各團軍官時相互調，遺缺以偽總司令部軍官教導團蒙人代替，然猶恐不可靠，平日監視極嚴。</p>
<p>日×自到綏後，一年來亳無進展，而且時受慘痛創傷，同時，×國內紛亂不堪，軍部勞燄高漲，據自包頭來人談：「×兵厭戰之心，日甚一日，日前包括市有×兵相聚飲酒，酒後放聲大哭，并相語云：「咱們不能囘國，非死干中國不可，盼望政府快快求和」又據蒙旗宣撫使署之×參事談，×軍四五名係大學畢業，在特務機關工作，到包頭高參事家強佔房屋，某參事妻無法曰：「我等亡國奴，祗有把房子讓給人家住。」×兵甚爲感動曰：「我等才是眞正亡國奴。」</p>
<p>自從新城諸戰役後，包頭偽軍更形恐慌，同時他處無兵可來助援，乃想了幾種奇妙的辦法，譬如製造許多木頭人，立于駐紮之院內，或在各街，字路口，高堆麻土袋，以備負隅据守，到了晚上，則穿着我回民衣服，準備游擊隊，遇襲時可以逃掉，由此觀之，綏遠的×偽軍，窘熊畢露，瓦解之期，已不正遠了。　（民革社）</p>
<p>【民革社榆林二日電】偽西北自治軍某某某部兩師反正、現已開抵某城、我軍於廿七日派某司令前往整理、並發賞金、以資鼓勵云、</p>

<h3>希特勒演說　廢棄英德海約　以挑釁態度答覆英國　藉口被壓迫繼續擴軍</h3>
<p>【路透社威希姆賽文港一日電】希特勒今日在此間發表演說、謂英國無權干涉德國內政、「巴力斯州居民、保衛其家邦時、英人究竟根據何種權限而槍擊之，吾人在中歐、并未傷殘以千計之人命、吾人之所爲、皆爲和平者」、論及英德海軍協定時、希特勒謂、「如英無意固守和平、則條約中之一切實際前提、皆已失其效用」、彼又言及「火中取栗者流」、適足以自焚其手耳、「吾人有一強大國家、足爲其權利之後盾、吾人並不須依靠別國或外國政治家之好感」、希特勒之演說、歷時凡一句鐘、演說當中、每爲「可恥」之呼聲所間斷、當其言及英國時、聽衆咸露鄱屑之聲、演說中並更引起哄堂大笑、希特勒後又言及德國對捷克之領土要求、彼謂、「黨英國仍極渺小之時、德國第一個帝王已在捷京加冕、苟捷克並未壓迫德人、及成為共產主義之工具、吾人對於捷克之獨立、並不存敵對之心」、論及併捷之舉時，希特勒曰、吾人乃用德國原有權利、加上歷史的指示、及吾人地理的位置、而有此舉、吾人絕無壓抑捷八之心、捷克人民將享受比其他所謂「純粹民族」所享受者更爲充分自由、余敢曾此舉已爲和平作極大之貢獻、蓋德捷台併、無形中已消滅中歐極大之危機、德國從無進攻別國之迷夢、我人祗求發展自身之經濟利益而已、德國正如貨物之大買主、實爲最理想之經濟合作國、至於軍械一層、他他國一日不放棄其壓迫德國之政策、則德國之擴軍一日不止、余深信本國之進步可較其他各國爲速、至於外交上之軸心關係、不論任何塲合、任何時間之下、均將、永遠保持、此爲世界最自然之政治工具、外間報載軸心决裂、實屬荒謬、若謂英蘇間無理或心理的想矛盾者、余向當作此語者慶賀、希特勒旋論及西班牙佛朗哥軍之權利、謂爲一國晚共產主義束縛之勝利、而對德靑年此次援助西內戰之功績、深引爲榮、希特勒引述德國戰前歷史、稱爲爭取太陽中之一隅地位、旣而復日，德國雖僅追隨其和平之步驟、而他國竟以嫌怨及執責之態度出而反對、卒至肇成戰禍、至是元首歷述他國對德所取之殘酷政策、繼且謂英方曾聲言、「降服德國自可給予英人以絕大之希望」、希特勒並聲言任何人不足自承已戰敗英雄的德意志、至是復追述威爾遜總統之「十四點」、略謂當時德國滿望能在無勝利者與戰敗者之條件下締結和約、無賠償損失之責任、不掠奪殖民地、並須共同縮軍、德方首先淮行裁軍、而他國亦卽當追隨、所有問題均須自由公開討論、而最重要者德國有自動决斷之權、德國對此保證固深信不疑、豈料各國今已背約負信、造成空前未有之紀錄，歐洲遂成罪惡之地、壓迫掠奪、無所不爲矣、</p>
<p>【路透社威希姆賽文港一日電】希特勒演說當中、聲稱廢除英德海軍協定、謂締約之目的、已不復存在、彼對於德國之中歐政策、加以辯護、謂截至此時爲止，德國政策、係爲維護和平者、德國現已在警衛中、而英國之包圍德國政策、實與歐洲之最高利益、互相矛盾、英陰謀推倒德國、此舉亦永遠不能成功、彼又言及上次之歐載、謂德國並未失敗、此後亦將無人能擊敗德國、有若干捎息謂希特勒演說時、神色躁急、狀極不安、與其平時之聲音、逈然有異、</p>
<p>【美聯社威希姆賽文港一日電】希特勒以挑釁之態度、答覆英國、謂、如英欲戰爭、彼已準備週旋、並宣稱、張伯倫現時之態度、將破壞英德之海軍協定、及慕尼黑四強協定、希特勒復稱、「若英國之政治家謂此次之問題、應由談判之方式解决之、余敢謂、前此固有十五年之時間供諸君努力也」、詞中之政治家、蓋指張伯倫而言也、關於各國競相擴軍之問題、希特勒稱、「如他國欲重整軍備、他人絕不能阻吾人同不樣爲之」、嗣宣稱、本年九月在紐倫堡召開之國社黨大會、將命名曰「和平大會」、最後謂、「今日試驗吾人實力之時機已屆、全德人民業已準備隨時動員矣」云、</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦一日電】英國官方、對於希特勒之演說、至今尚未有所表示、諒須將其全文、細加研究、然後方加以此評也、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦二日電】希特勒之演說、竟公然接受英國反浸略之挑戰、希特勒逐點駁斥英國、並以取消英德海軍協定爲要挾、此乃希特勒認爲恐嚇英國之最好辦法、希特勒此次演說、似已將歐洲兩大×對之壁壘顯然劃分、此乃英國屢欲避免而不可得者，英德關係自連戰結束以來、誠無如現時之緊張者也、</p>
<p>【路透社華監頓二日電】參議員畢特門本日宣稱、張伯倫保證援波、已展開歐洲和平之途徑、渠并稱、美國官方最近表示、當戰爭之時、美國頗有擁護民主國家之意、或能制止希特勒之以後土地攫奪、</p>

<p>直接控制　至於比利時以及北演波蘭的海域家、六月以來、曾不斷飽受政治上之壓迫、將來亦勢必被迫、而滿足德國之大慾也、西方民主國家態度之突趨強硬、使德國有與西方民主國家作戰之憂、而德國之欲波蘭保持軍事中立之意亦至切、以東進政策而言、波蘭之地位、其影響亦至大者也、故德國期待於波蘭之第一保證、爲立卽將上西利西亞之鐵鑛、交付德國、法方巳感覺此事之嚴車而認爲一旦有事、德國將佔領斯洛伐克邊境北部之</p>

<p>清楚堅定　之協定、否則蘇聯將袖手旁觀、蘇聯並不因德國之威脅而有切實之感、德國對蘇之目的、固在經濟上、而仍欲與蘇維持友好也、英法兩國、雖得蘇聯以爲援、惟對付德意時、亦將感覺相當困難、如更加蘇聯置身度外、則歐局將更無望矣、</p>

<h3>捷克對英人　負債問題　英嚴重應付中</h3>
<p>【路透社倫敦二日電】英政府頃嚴重應付捷克斯洛伐克對英國人民所負之債務問題、英格蘭銀行、循財部之託、現正徵求投資捷克政府或公司之公債、商行之股票、銀行之存款、及其他一切債務詳細報吿、唯商業債務及蘇台德區內之債務、則不在徵求之列、</p>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>侵略陣線的狼狽周章</h3>
<p>自從捷克淪亡的痛苦經驗，證明了英法妥協外交的誤人自誤之後，蘇聯在全世界的聲威愈加提高，民主和平陣線開始走上鞏固與擴大的大路，於是法西斯侵略軍團的德意日各國的行動，就顯得狼狽周章起來。一方面是隨着侵略勢力的發展，侵略集團內部矛盾更形尖銳化，另一方面則因各國內外危機的嚴重，又不得不以強化「軸心」來加以支持。於是道幾天的報紙上發現了許多關於侵略國家的矛盾滑稽的消息。</p>
<p>同時，觀乎最近日本方面之擴大反蘇尤其是反英運動，德國亦巳開始大規模的反英，如希特動四月一日演說公然撕毀英德海約，對英漫罵，日德此種行動，顯爲英國最近親近蘇聯及英法較強硬熊度的反響，可為侵略陣綫之第一次的陷於被動地位。</p>
<p>不過我們要認淸，就目前而論，法西斯侵略陣綫不僅不會瓦解，而且還會強化。三月下旬墨索里尼演說，特別強調堅持德意軸心，四月一日希特勒演說更稱「德意軸心在一切情勢及時間中均將繼積。」日德商務協定固然正在進行，而德國再度爲日送行對華誘降陰謀亦在醖釀。因而我們今日強調侵略陣綫分裂，不能不算是錯誤，若因而鬆懈我警防侵略者的勢力，以及對侵略陣綫中某一國家存何幻想，那就不能不算是罪惡了。</p>

<h3>英澳政府協定　澳洲供給港軍用飛機　澳機廠月可製六十架戰時達二百餘架　本港陸軍當局將繼續徵募華人工程兵</h3>

<h3>聯絡友誼，提倡正當娛樂　業餘交誼會記</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>業餘聯誼社昨擴大舉行歡迎薪社友</p>
<p>活力總得要發展的；業餘幹嚒？這一個問題，有很多人，他們覺司到不該在打牌，跳舞，上茶樓，看電影——放毒的電影——這些方面糜爛下去。在這些方面，亦並不會得釗眞正的快樂。因此，他們遠離「荒淫與無恥」的一面，而朝着「嚴肅與活潑」的一面邁進。</p>
<p>每當夜慕張開，「霓紅」燈富有誘惑力的夜的都市的時候，你可以看到穿中裝的，着西裝的，男的，女的，一個個離開辦公室，吃飽了飯，陸陸續續地集中到干諾道二十三號的處所去。登上沒有電梯的四層樓雖然是很吃力，興奮的步伐却使他們三步作二步跨地登上去。這裏，就是香港業餘聯誼社的社址。海風一陳陣吹拂過來，眺望雲天，還得投進大自然的懷抱，雖然這兒是瀰漫着「黑烟」的香港。</p>
<p>閱書報，玩乒乓、學習國語，學習粵語提高子學歌詠，裝腔作勢排劇，一還有讀書會，時事座談會……凡是可以讓生活力在有益方面發展的，應有盡有，你喜歡什麽，就玩什麽。有說有笑。旣嚴肅，又活動。這眞是業餘的一圖好去處。該會在孔聖堂正式成立的時候，一即是今年一月八日，那時不過只有社員一百八十餘人，最近徵求社員的結果，現在新會社員四百八十餘人了。昨天該社在孔聖堂舉行歡迎新社友擴大交誼會，盛況彌加熱烈，各方面的進步出賽，亦越是使人刮目相看，無限感奮。</p>
<p>雖然老天不做情，密佈了陰的天氣，可是到了三句半的時候，天靑日白了，孔聖堂立刻裝滿了該社的新舊社友，以及家屬，來賓，足足擁有七八百人的一個頗有可觀的數目。</p>
<p>大人的笑聲，小孩的叫聲，呼來喊去，整個會塲洋溢着融融樂樂的氣氛。</p>
<p>行禮如儀後，主席姚建侯致開會詞，除了熱烈地申述該社最近社務的進展外，特別指出他們該做的三點在務：（一）在集體生活中增長知識，（二）用芷當的娛樂來代替不正當的消遺；（三）；貢献我們所有的力量於祖國，爭取抗戰最後的勝利。</p>
<p>話說得很簡潔，很動聽．接着就是社務的報吿，「我們過去幹過的工作第一是設立圖書館；第二是響應各種愛國運動；弟三是成立劇團與歌詠隊；第四是學術方面的出版三期刊物，組織讀書會，時事座談會，演講會，國語班，粵語班……等。第五，聯誼方面角星期旅行，野餐……等，第六，爲社友服務方面，巳接洽了很多商店，公司，書局，報館，優待社友光顧。」</p>
<p>演講是事前預約本報，編輯郭步陶先生担任的。他老人家語重心長地說出業餘聯誼相自找教育的重要性，還引伸他老人家從事新聞事業的經過爲例，越講越起勁，滔滔不絕地，足足講了一個多鐘頭。</p>
<p>儀式行了「國民公約」的宣誓。全體虔誠地肅立地發誓。王君恒先生誠懇地勗勉大家切實遵行，才是宣誓的意義。爭取抗戰勝利，亦端賴我們全民振作起來。方與嚴元生給獎徵求社友成續最佳者五名之後，游藝從此開始了。</p>
<p>歌詠，口琴，歌舞…等節目；除該社表演外，還有中華業餘學校歌詠隊，商務書館歌詠隊、耀中幼稚園等團體參加。最精采的節目，是該社社友屠雲甫君的口技與方言的表演。各種禽獸的聲音，以及從北平到華中華南的幾十種方言與曲調。惟妙惟肖地表現出來。有聲有色，詼諧白出地使之捧腹，鼓掌。</p>
<p>最未是該社劇團表演反封建的話劇「別的苦女人」，頗爲動人。還有反×的一齣話劇「黑影」，因爲幕色蒼茫，宣吿下次再見。</p>

<h3>漫談花布街</h3>
<p>香港之有「花布街」，正和廣州之有「楊巷」一樣，彼此都是呢絨疋頭，和花布的大市場。講幽默一點，可以說是一對姊妹。然而今日廣州的楊巷，正不知被兇狼的×人摧殘蹂躍至怎樣的程度了，如果在楊巷，廣州，以至於我們每一寸的失土，未恢復它固有的美麗和繁榮，和我們的「民族之恨」未消除之前，那麽，我們的資任便一刻都不能够放鬆，而且更要加緊！</p>
<p>「花布街」的位置在中區，兩頭啣接替皇后道和德輔道的中部，距離號稱遠東唯一的中環新街市，不過一百數十碼。它的原名本來是水安街，正因爲富有詩意的「混名」成立之後，因受不了新陳代謝作用的影響，它的眞名反而漸漸的糢糊下去，而幾使人忘懷了。</p>
<p>「花布街」是這樣一個平凡的市場，本來沒有甚麽可記的地方，而且勺居香港的人，大體都能知到它的梗概。然而，事實的啟示，我們往任能够在平凡之中，找出不平凡的故事，這個故事就是我想向讀者介紹的。</p>
<p>「花布街」的疋頭商店連「擋口」在內，一共有五十七家，而店裏高懸着疋頭行公會所發給的「根絕劣貨憑證」的證書的、却只有二十一家，然則，沒有這張證書的，難道都是劣貨的銷場麽，我當時在這樣的想着，後來經過一度的調查之後、才恍然沒有証書的，只是還沒有加入疋頭行公會做會員而已，不過近本港報章，常常有關於×貨在港銷場激增的紀載，×貨的市場，爲甚麽又會由死寂而再變蓬勃呢；我們探本尋源，就不難得釗一個答了。</p>
<p>有很多由內地來香港的朋友，無論甚麼東西，都想買些囘去，因爲這裏的東西，在地們心目中，通通都要無捐稅的平貨」。他們祗怨恨目己腰包裏沒有這樣多的鈔票，否則大有非把整個香港市場的東西，買個清光不可之勢。」所以花布，也是他們然光類的市塲之一，</p>
<p>你一走進了「花布街」你會感覺到凶湧的人游，和紛然雜作的聲音，不斷的向你眼晴和耳朵理刺進，「買拉……平呀……一文六碼，大……姑」。倩皮的夥計，放出了貪婪的眼光，伸長了額子，提高了嗓子，向每一個女性願客發出那經挑而浮滑的聲音。這理的夥計似乎不大歡迎獨身的漢子，和有男姓偕行的女顧客，最受歡迎的還是三五成羣的「密斯」，她們到店理去，雖然不一定是有光顧，然而，夥計們却不據煩鎖一五一十的，把地們認爲是「靚」的布疋，搬得積如小坵的堆在貨幢的上面。要是你是個獨身漢，跑到那裏隨便的問問價錢，而沒有「交易」的話，最低限度，他們會暗暗的罵你一句「豆泥鬼」，（「豆泥鬼」是袋裏沒有鈔票的意思），說不定還要向你破口謾罵！</p>
<p>我不是有意詆燬他們，但事實還是事實，不容我來掩飾，然則那裏的夥計都是這樣的嘴，那又未必，十室之邑，必有忠信，眞能替顧客効勞，殷勤作業，目不邪視的，也很多很多。不過我們得明白，「害群之馬」，這個道理，所以，我希望他們能够念起互相策勵，來一淸潔運動，對優秀的獎動他，對腐化的的糾正他，甚而至施以適當的應有的懲，以持商業的道德，那麽，他們還不失爲識時務的俊傑，否則他們的前途祗有日漸向墮落那方頭消滅而已！（新）</p>

<p>（澳門快訊）×自　月廿七日突陷容桂後、江門石岐同時告急、當晚×即派海陸空分三路攻　攻江門、我團隊卽會合正規軍分頭截擊、血戰九日、×傷亡過千、後以×軍砲火過烈、我工事盡燬、且對×已索得相當代價、遂退出江門、集中會城附近繼續抗戰、一日晚在會城郊外夜激戰、殲×甚多、×軍不支、復向江門方面撤退、我承勝反攻江門、現仍在混戰中</p>
<p>新會防務鞏固</p>
<p>江門我軍經劇戰後、移轉陣地，向新會縣　結果、　綫置於峯山間、阻×進攻、棠下我軍，常江鬥失陷時、尚與×軍作戰、嗣以江門告陷、棠下一綫、遂形突出、已向沙坪方面後退、刻下我方在沙　至會縣城間、怖一橫直戰陣、鶴山與新會兩縣團隊、聯台握守、正規軍陳章楊鶴　等部，亦會同各地方團隊協力防守、會城防務、可併無虞、</p>

<h3>×貨傾銷　大量粵　×貨改裝混售</h3>
<p>【澳門快訊】×軍自佔廣州後，其隨軍商人班在粵力謀發展商業、實行其經濟侵略、近將其躉存黃埔貨倉商品、賤價傾銷、查其最大宗火油火柴生油等、幷在長堤先施對面舊日之南國推銷場、現×改爲軍經班推銷場、陳列化粧品罐頭食品等、僱用少年　子柑銷外、則由福大公司招請代理批發、據聞火油每箱僅沽軍票六元、比外貨之鷹牌低廉三份之一、生油每罐十六元、火柴則每箱一百二十包售十元、故一般漢奸、以有利　圖、竟改裝象人內地發售、連日西江一帶、火水生油大廉、無知鄉民、多和其價廉、爭相購用、現我當局已嚴爲　範云、</p>

<h3>廣州×畏我團隊潛伏　×司令部遷郊外　市內祇有消費絕無生產　×軍防空力量極為薄弱</h3>
<p>（沙面通訊）邇來廣州治安，每况愈　、其　因爲×軍風紀敗壞、偽自銜　隊本爲匪類變相，更因大部地痞無賴爲生活逼迫、挺而走險、故白日强掠、已成例行故事、×人雖多方吸誘各鄉及省、人囘市，希圖繁榮廣州、而　在情形、人早談虎色變、截至現在、據外記者調杳全市人口仍不能超過十二萬左右、且有趨于減少之勢、而繁榮可熊問題、因中內復業商店、全爲消費性質、生　廠號絕無一家、資本稍多者裏足不前、旣無生產、伺能繁榮、此又爲事實之明證</p>
<p>×軍機關　現駐調查</p>
<p>自正金銀行被我游擊隊襲擊而後益以鐵血國投函警告媚、酒　、×軍知我民眾武力　市內者不　、恐受襲擊、原駐西濠口新亞酒店之×南支派遺軍司令部、急遷出郊外，具×軍機關駐在地，亦有變更、調查如下、派貴軍司令部遷黃花　附近執信學校、憲兵司令部在原日警察局、警備司令部在警局對門舊保安總隊部、陸軍特務機關在財政廳、海里特務機關在文德路舊市立中山圖書館、所有軍實糧米馬四等則在東較場、</p>
<p>防空力薄　火器甚少</p>
<p>×在廣州修築近郊防禦工事甚力、白雲山附近、粵秀山後、以及廣增公路、廣花公路、均有加築、惟防空力量則極薄弱、×高射部隊、原設河南伍家祠、現已遷至近郊東沙　宅區內、伍家祠前、仍　有島射炮部隊司令部字樣以掩飾、續查現駐東沙住宅區內以掩護執　學校命令部之高、部隊火器、　以高射炮二門、高射機槍二挺、此外其　機關、均無此類火器、七月卅晚、黃花　曾發生槍聲，聞係我團隊夜襲×高射炮陣地、惟未證實、</p>
<h3>船務特訉</h3>
<p>法國　船公司之　輪　子號、前自滬抵港、查該　當航至距港二百里之海面、車葉之一部、突告下沉，故該輪抵港後、旋入太古船塢檢驗，並配囘原日之推動機，始開行赴海防、計內是項工程，已延　天航期云、</p>

<h3>從惠陽到潮安</h3>
<p>— 林廣進</p>
<p>一、走在危機未過的東江</p>
<p>我本是第×游擊區政治部裏　的一個工作人員、因爲政治部奉了上級命令由一月底起暫行停止活動、於是結束了我在　擊隊的工作、使我不能不離開思陵、另行找尋工作幹、</p>
<p>二月九日的早晨、我冒着凛烈的北風，僱了一隻小船、向東江上游進發、逆水逆風、船兒是蟻行一樣的俊、屈伏在船艙裏經過　天悠長的時間、始抵達　源縣城、又步行了三天崎嶇的羊腸小路、才到了東江上游的老　、</p>
<p>在這一段的行程中、我曾看見了許多被×人姦淫過的所在、無人理會地悲哀沉痛地在那兒悄然嘆息、滿身尚留　着斑斑的血痕、充份暴露出×人的兇狼與殘暴、我又會聽見淪陷區許多鋒鏑餘生的弱小老百姓在呻吟泣訴、已遭逢暴×的摧殘與　躪、復遭到後新興的苛捐　稅的袖削、及喪失天良的一土匪一肆意的搶掠、行將顚沛流離、無以自活、同時我更會看見許多民運工作者、鎭天的奔走呼號、惟得不到堂地政府對他們作袖極性的政洽領導及切實協助、工作無續展開、使他們　感到流的血、流的汗、是落在沙漢中、匯合不到抗戰洪流、異常苦悶，而且我又知道、從前惠淪陷時有少數政府公務人員、本來早已退出惠城、不是沒有吃，亦不是設有穿、而竟於×人未退出惠陽時、沒有一點理由的跑到城理做　民、甘心作×人的奴隸、願意做亡國奴、這種爲人共棄的民挨敗類，根本就要剷除、可是在惠陽克復後、她們不但沒受到政府的制栽，而且竟有些爬上高枝去了！</p>
<p>所有這些、無論任何一個到過東江的人、都可以看得見、聽得到的、這些現象的留存、充份反映出東江的危機木過、</p>
<p>本來×人此次退出惠博、是因其兵力的不敷，幷感於我漫山遍野的游擊隊，自衛團及國軍的威脅、在戰略上不得不得時的撤退、這當是×人力之不逮、實非　情之所甘、增城石龍一帶×兵最近對東江的那種撲人姿態、一方面雖則是響應具各線戰事的一種亂人耳目的動作、另一方面是防禦我軍的圍攻、作一種攻學的防禦、但是這不能說×人已完全的放棄了窺　東江的陰謀、據　近來×人派了許多漢奸到近東江一帶作政洽的活動，這證明×人的野心未死，時有捲土重來的可能、同時假如×人對於進攻各線軍事有所不利的時候，也許會在東江有所動作、響愈各方戰局，以資牽所制、這是×人的慣技及　手好戲、我們是應該特別警惕卹、</p>
<p>我們爲了粉　×人的陰謀、爲了東江不冉淪于手×、我們應該勇敢地克服所有的　點、積　地扶植及領導靑年運動、動員民衆起來衛國衛鄉、同時卹緊救濟難民及　除一切苛捐維稅、改善人民生活、幷澈底否明一切苛捐雜稅、改善人民生活、並澈低查明乘危搶刦的匪徒、嚴予懲辦、以維公安、尤須澈底查究公務人員中之甘作順民附×份子、肅淸民族敗類、　是一個急暹的呼籲、同時謹以禹二分的熱誠請當地政府迅速地予以接納、</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>從事交文化宣傳的　中國劇團在紐約　甚得彼邦人士之觀迎</h3>
<p>從事中國海外文華宣傳的劇團、在唐夫人領導之下，包括音樂家、戲劇家、　歌曲家、這次周游美國而於二月初在紐約Mercury大戲院　演中國戲劇五整夜、盛況空前、一時消息遍刊美國各地報章、</p>
<p>最後一夜、肇啓熊、由『中國之友』美國社會須袖威廉姆博士致詞、對中國的劇團這次旅行美國、作文化宣傳、致以莫大敬意、上演五個夜埸的結果、是博得美國劇評家的好評、是贏餘了約美金五千元、</p>
<p>此次徐劇、最後一夜、更由美國民衆援華會及美國醫樂助華會邀請、在紐約上演完畢，即往全美各大城市輸　公演、故紐約之上演、實爲該團在美演劇之第一聲，</p>
<p>紐約泰晤十報曾謂、「彼等若因籌慕捐欵、作醫藥上之救助、而來美演劇、則彼等將加倍獲得好評、蓋彼等確使一藝術淵源非常豐富之占國、在海外獲得不少友人也、中國之藝衛、實行遵守占典已幾千年矣、存在於理想之區域、乃純粹之藝術也』、</p>
<p>此次中國劇團團員中、最受美國人歡迎者、莫如飾「楊貴　』之張女士，渠之照片、在美國街　中、報紙及雜誌封面上發現、一連有幾星期之久、其盛譽亦可見一斑矣、</p>
<h3>首輪影片介紹　響導姑娘</h3>
<p>「嚮導姑娘」並不是一張了不起的影片、這是顯而易見的、因爲在題名上、你就可以想見、是怎樣一個東西，全片的故事、自首至尾和一切　愛片一樣、沉授在色情　諧的氣氛裏、這些劇作者是不想觀衆對這「敎育的武器」接受什麼啓示的、它最高的企圖只是使觀衆在開映的一偭半小時內轟聲大笑、這樣在營業上、這影片可以有白分之百的把握、而這些觀衆們，也在這　遊戲戀愛的圖片裏、忘記了世界、忘　了　會、美國片的麻醉性、在這些地方是有着具體的表現的，</p>
<p>這個影片的構成、正和前面所說、它很滑稽、同時也會人使失笑、劇作者在這個故事裏、一共佈置了五個塗了滑稽色彩的人物、一個工程帥、是一個富　、但他却　喜研究烹飪、第二個是他的女兒、是見了男人就戀愛的嬌養的小姐、第三、一個舊俄的貴族、一個王子、却到這工程師家裏當廚子、第四，一個事務代辦所的主持人，一個聰明能幹的姑娘第五、一個年靑的研究機械的少年、全劇就利用了這五個人、串演了這一齣錯綜的戀愛喜劇、在這裏、我們不能不承認這幾個人物的性格都是寫得生動血活潑的、那個工程帥的女兒，一看見少年鮑勃、就表現了一幅「一見傾心」的樣子、一直就來追求他、是一種挺可愛的手法、那個「王子」廚子、宣佈了他是售俄的王子以後、工嗅師女兒馬上又去追求他、並且很快的栩他結了婚、在這裏、把嬌貴而傾慕虛榮的女孩的心理、表現無遺、至於寫工程師之糊塗、事務代辦所姑娘的多情、少年鮑勃率直、都使全劇充滿了笑料、</p>
<p>演　蘭李對於人物個性、有很强固地抓取、寫事務代辦所姑娘（康絲登斐納）個性的倔强、當她接到工程帥電話請她預　少年鮑勃和工程帥女兒訂昏禮的時候，她氣得碎了電話筒、拉斷了電　機的總綫、然後異常憤怒的在辦公室室兜圈子、在一神快的動作的調子底下、不單現出女主人公憤怒的情緒、同時也表現了精明能幹好勝的女孩兒家倔强的性格、</p>
<p>對於那位見男人就生情的工程師女兒、在事務代辦所、那副失掉魂靈動作遲緩的樣了、不得不使你失笑、在地下室追求少年飽勃時、又是一副『小烏依人』嬌憨的樣子、在動作和地位上、都顯示了它的準確性，</p>
<p>論演員、　絲登斐納的事務代辦所主任很老練純熱、這個十足那　市型的演員、演這個角色是很適合的、男主角范休潑拉斯雖是新人、但却很沉着、其餘如密夏奧亞的俄國王子、却利羅吉斯的工程師等、都很滑稽可笑、總之、這是一支新款的喜劇、</p>
<h3>化粧新術</h3>
<p>美國軍影演員面部化装、現通用一種有塑形效用的質體、名「第六號」（No．6）、此種化裝物乃電影化裝師湯傑克所發明、其優點有三、（一）無論伺種面相，均可隨心所欲、卽時扮成、手續之簡使、遠非從前之化裝衛所能及、（二）此種化裝物塗於面部、成一薄面具、然面部種種衣情、如徽笑大笑　欠皺眉等、仍　照常表現，不爽毫、（三）此種化裝物爲質琉鬆血能吸汗、旣易塗敷、而採去時亦不致損及皮膚、</p>
<p>法宮「艷后」一片中飾路易十六之羅　　利、即由湯傑克用「第六號」爲之化裝、惟妙惟肖、巧奪天工、若以路易十六之　片與之對照、將不信其爲好萊塢之演員、而疑爲十八世紀末葉之法皇再世也、</p>
<h3>英意之播音戰　先後利用同一歌星</h3>
<p>無綫電在兮日，不僅爲供聽衆消　間的工具、世界各國政治家又把廣播當做政洽官傳的利器、如政黨競選、元首政見、政府態度等、都利用無綫電廣播、使民衆普遍聽到，效果之大、當非舉行一城一地的公開演講所及、不僅此也、最近各國竟進一步而又把它當做國際政治上宣傳戰的工具了、</p>
<p>這裏我們可舉例、意大、利不久之前、曾利用一個歌曲家、在近東各地（包括開羅、巴格達、　馬　加、耶路撤冷等地、（電台廣播、而目的是在作反英宣傳、這位歌曲　就是亞　杜華哈Adbul—Wahab、是一個半瞎眼的囘敎徐、在他帶有羅曼史的作曲中、他自己每是主唱人、意大利就役現阿刺伯人很歡喜聽他的歌曲、而把他利用了、</p>
<p>大約在一年之前、英國發覺了意國向阿刺伯人廣播的陰謀、於是也想利用廣　對付　國，亞　杜華哈在英意競作國際宣傳戰的情况上、却得到一個大好的獲利機會、最初他爲義國廣播、一個節目的報酬是不很多、但後來他要加到美金四百元、意國表示不能支付如此的價植，然而英國、對於　個在阿刺伯人中享啊盛名的歌曲家、却不惜出此一筆代、　冀可收　意官傳的效果、亞比杜華哈立刻給英國拉了過去、替英國作廣播官傳、血且短國着他播唱「莎士比亞的英歌』一曲、代價加到了美金六百二十五元、目的在這文支歌、官傳英國文化的背景、使以前津貼這歌星的法西斯蒂感到不安和難堪、</p>

<h3>真假李惠堂鬥法加山　港埠際隊克星華　生華表演比前天略好仍遭敗績</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】乍暖還輕冷、風雨晚來方定、斷魂最是近淸明、天涯遊子、近日偏多病、</p>
<p>昨午『天哭』、旣斷遊子之魂、亦掃球迷之興，雖則加山大戰、風雨不改、然而雨中打仗、不免手手毛腳、若「好齣頭」赤成「打泡戲」、有何趣味、</p>
<p>幸至午後、天忽放開「笑容」、這番足球好事、乃依卜吉時辰、展開戰局、惟加山經雨、革潤泥肥、球人　頭、略欠爽、</p>
<p>星華足隊隊、挾藝渡　洋、由菲來港、震動球城、爲的是這枝軍馬、名重天南、此　球迷、深致景仰、惟前天出帥、卽　敗仗、一般　民、添一個原來如此一的印象、</p>
<p>昨天冉動兵戎、出戰扯非項際隊、場面還算熱鬧、不過、比　前天、看客數目全少打個五折、准考原因、甚爲單闡、前大遭大敗、昨天一場雨、遂壓低了不少球迷的興趣、</p>
<p>埸衆注目的「新李惠堂」謝慶福，果然上陣、但地心廣體胖、軍量一百力十磅强、已很少很少輕巧精伶的作風、候機會冬於找機會、與最近在滬的孫　順依稀州似、然而他比較跳得高、頂上功夫很出色、傳球也有「路數」、　門則不一定有把握、惟因脚頭力勁、射出的球倒傷炮彈一般利害、星華不致吃「光蛋」、全靠他一腳、</p>
<p>港隊前綫指揮官「正貨」李惠堂、與「鼎膺」確不同、因地旣有高强本事、又有領導材能、置身軍中、一心一德、故單獨此點，已爲別人所不能、慶　豈得相提並論嗎、</p>
<p>告山奴自港菲埠際賽後、便不肯輕現色相、昨天參戰，乃視爲　習性員、準備不久赴菲報聘、</p>
<p>星華所排陣線、比前天的完整些、因爲前線另調兩各將加入、攻力增加許多、朱成貴則採第三內衛防守法、雖牧效甚微、然已不像　天集中防守之弊、故而全軍表渲起來、亦比前天起勁許多、失敗乃技術不如人罷、</p>
<p>察約翰演出、比前天遜色、溫關宗　盤、與慶福甚合作、　因足生毛疾、大致尚　得云佳、其他各員、都極努力，</p>
<p>港隊人馬、與原定有異、『大鐵剷』李天生、及一急先鋒一侯澄滔、雙雙休養、讓「硬漢」侯榕生及「小史」上場、整隊攻守、不無影響、衣史　蘭　、初充左翼、「冥頑不靈」、失機獨多、馮李兩國產先鋒、一則專事傳供、一則專找機會、相依爲命、不可分離、惟惠堂有幾次欲射而躊　、人謂其懶慢、我則謂「脚下留情」、</p>
<p>全賽過程、不甚大觀、情况冷淡、上半時港隊多佔優勞，惟因　華力抗、僅獲一球之微、下半時雙方機會　均，故港隊雖　勝兩球、星華亦報回一只、以三比一完了全埸二戰情紀下、（球場太歲）</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>兩分鐘、告山奴斬將奉旗、衣史杜蘭　邊防接應、進一門角、發彈攻門、其勢絕勁、衆爲紀錄可開、不圖利棠反身猛撲、皮球斜出門角、開萬回師救出、</p>
<p>七分鐘、成　與惠堂爭球、「球怪」到底厲害、奪綫鈎多立于無人阻止之景祥、景祥竟發空彈、將球射高而出、</p>
<p>十二分鐘、星華前鋒不甘受侮，拔隊總攻、海珠斜吊烈武銅頭頂射、可惜高些</p>
<p>十五分鐘、奄巴臣得比路度之接濟、在右路施其地傳、惠堂欲截來球、竟然失足滑去、告山適立于伏越位置、不顧一切、猛射建功、成（一比〇）之局、</p>
<p>廿八分鐘，星華一度進攻、海珠切中、約翰雖能接應過關、但最後一脚、伊失凖繩、旋慶祝又在港隊陣地頂一妙球、越楣少許而逝、</p>
<p>下半場</p>
<p>五分鐘、慶福在港陣邊陲追球，得手郎傳，彈落門左、約翰不審情形、來遲失機、未幾、約翰切中美妙、將功　罪、均幹見來勢不佳、于對方前鋒衝到之前、躍高搶救、姿勢玲瓏、</p>
<p>十二分鐘、港隊念攻不巳、關示囘帥救駕，欲保中原、惟惠堂已乘機　傳告山奴、他毫不　疑、又施毒　，柏棠離能仆　、以阻具　、但不能止球入網、（二比〇）</p>
<p>十七分鐘、港隊又攻、有如排山倒海、柏棠單騎離城、此時「小史」得中路之傳遞、進至門側、本　從容向空門一射、卽可得利、但結果斜出荒野、</p>
<p>廿分鐘二　武足場離場、大勢已去、然約翰仍從中活動、與慶福合作、偷渡血谷關、卒于紛　中、射球入網、打破光蛋（一比二）</p>
<p>廿二分鐘、恭祝星華勝球之掌聲甫止間、惠掌得小史之助、　過兩關、放出平地炮，飛入京城，成（三比一一之　、有頃、鳴金停戰港隊程捷、</p>

<h3>東方足球隊　昨日南征　職球員一行十五人</h3>
<p>東方體育　足球隊、因應越南體育會之約、於昨日下午四時　慶元輸啓程、貪　　球員十行十一人（領隊）　榆、（守門）　對顯漢、徐亨、（內　）萌華國、曾促雲、徐步雲、（　　）羅偉權、許竟成、李海清、（前線）陳吶土、吳祺祥、許廣文奎、李德祺、曹秋　、高美斯、雖東方原有等健將如侯　等內在港業榜　身、未能隨征、但已有　上名將許文奎、曹秋　　加入　戰、相成　必有可觀，又昨慶　踚開行　、天氣不大好、時下驟雨、因此送行者參寥無幾人，又　方會爲增加會員與趣起見，由今晚起、舉行會員「採寶哪」游戲、凡　會員均可報名參加云</p>
<h3>教部注意　小學體育　每日實行早操　決定實施方針</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）教育部以體育爲人之自衛基本要則、惟訓練又非加諸成人老年人可以、先奏必加之於　學兒童、始克有效、按人之健康與否、係由兒童時代餐成，小學體育之重要、當此抗戰熱烈之時期中、尤宜極力提倡、現教部令各省市公立或已立案之私立小學遵照部定積圈施行、每日上課前須實行早操、茲將小學體育實施方針錄誌如下，甲、根據畢校環境、（）場所、（二）用具、（三）經濟、乙、根據學生程度、（一）運動能力、（二）知識能力、丙、根據地方情形，（一）　　方面、（二）習慣方面、了、最據敎材之價值、（一）　時　地可以運動、（二）啓發兒童良好行為、（三）其他、</p>
<h3>南華徵求冠軍　今晚揭曉</h3>
<p>南華體育會、是屆徵求、各隊　異常踴躍、預料成續，當必可觀，查該會各徵求隊冠軍名次、定於今日下午八時捐曉、查該會是屆徵求隊、共達廿、隊之多、其中均屬努力份子、聞各隊成績相埒，收入銀數，異常接近、對於是屆冠軍，何隊獲得、尚難預測云、</p>
<h3>公開籃球賽　樂方克警察　乙組華南雄得勝　今夕祗有兩場舉行</h3>
<p>公開男子藍球賽、昨日首場乙組華南對國際、華南以三十七比三—六僅勝、</p>
<p>次場甲組東方對警察、以過去戰績而論、警察　非東方之×、　昨日警察努力頑抗之下、結果雖以四十七比五十二致勛、但一度曾以三十九比卅七佔先，在完埸前十五分鐘、又數度打成平手，查警察之能其此戰績、並非僥倖、因比賽過程、東方最大亦以一球佔先、警察若非在最後兩分鐘中、因後衛之被罰而連失三分、則勝負之數、尚難定誰屬也，然東方因徐亨、足球隊遠征、攻勢影響不少、而馮念華、黃鼎分等、演出亦未見精彩、僅陳宗祺較爲出色、挽囘不少險球、</p>
<p>警察則以三印稽球員居功最大，因三人身高手長、形勢七佔許多便宜、籃上爭奪、盡佔優勞、而在×籃推射、戰成日意、惜姿態不佳、失却應勝機會、全家聯絡之不能合拍，亦爲不操勝之　結、至傳球旣不能避免對方之截奪、接球亦每失于浮輕、故隊員雖具優勝之身材、但終爲雙方技術之所制、若假以相當之訓練、當成勤旋、</p>
<p>比賽過程，東方馮念華首開紀錄、羅志安隨之建功、故至警察拿連星連中二元、嗣後各有所獲、雙方先後造成十比十及十二比十二之平局、迨東方得黃鼎芬，馮念華許度中的、上半場完結、卽以廿一比十七佔先、</p>
<p>易地再戰、馮念華頗露鋒、東方又先後以廿九比廿六及卅五比卅二佔先、嗣後警察陳錦奎、拿　銳不可當、造成卅　比卅七及四十七比四十七之緊張局面、直至最後兩分鐘、東方乘馮念華之射罰、竟被連得二分、結果東方以五十二比四十七　勝、</p>
<p>末塲乙組華雄對海光，結果華雄以七十五比二十四大勝、</p>
<p>（國際）</p>
<p>（總分四十七分）</p>

<h3>沙發</h3>
<p>— 杜埃</p>
<p>『倘能說，沙發是作叫人坐下去不願起來的東西，」一位剛從內地出來的朋友，感嘆似的對我說，「那麼香港，就是一隻沙發　了，如果你在它上面坐久些，連站起的意念，也會消耗的呢！」</p>
<p>我是很明白這話的意思的。記得當他還沒有離開香港，前，常常要爲這個「沙發問題，而苦悶起來。</p>
<p>「實在的」他離開時十分惘惑的說。「住得久了，討厭得很。但一到决　走的時候，就覺得雄捨似的』。</p>
<p>我想，這在他是並不虛飾的。因爲比較的說來，他的生活是够得上「單純的安定」。選種生活的人，多少要覺得像坐沙發似的，然而像他這樣過着意味貧乏的都市的知識份子，一碰到大亞灣的硝烟，就開始不安，看見別的年靑人那麼熱的動員回鄉的情形，他就越覺這隻沙發的魅人力量了。是的，雖然他的生活使他像坐沙發似的，但他却還年靑，純潔而富於熱情，漸漸地感到他也應該如人們一樣的動起來了，一直到離開　的兩天，他告訴我决意從『沙發』上站起來，我這才相信，眞的，他要跟着年輕的戰士們囘國服務了，我緊緊地握上他的手：</p>
<p>「這是不錯的。」</p>
<p>當他離開了的那些日子，我在偶爾空隙的時候，常常要　念起他那個沉悶的影子來。我想：他在內地，那火一樣的生活會把他煆煉的，但我却也在想，說不定還要囘到沙發上的吧！</p>
<p>果然的，在三個月的一天深　，忽的他出現在我的家裏。而且坐下來我說了開首那旬話，我雖然很期白他的意思，但却一面在懷疑。</p>
<p>「怎麼？你打算倒在沙發裏了嗎？』</p>
<p>「不！」他氣勢凌人的說、像在抗拒侮辱似的。一</p>
<p>「那麼，有什麼必要的事情，非回來不可呢？」</p>
<p>他攏動着腦袋，準備着要說很多話的樣子，但結果却嚴重的　了短短的一話，</p>
<p>「我囘來要幹部的。內地發生幹部恐慌呵！』</p>
<p>「那麼，己向你的後方接洽了嗎？」</p>
<p>一接洽了。但是，我們的同鄕會，祗　供給我五個人，而且却是些亳無工作經驗的。怎樣了你們文化界的人，對於訓練幹部，和動員囘國的工作，好像是很不積極似的。」因爲他自覺態度於認眞，所以到最後就徵過笑起來。</p>
<p>我告訴他，差不多谷團體的好幹部，都已跟着各種各樣的服務團出發去了。這裏的靑年救亡團體，亦發生幹部恐慌哩！</p>
<p>這樣，我們就慢慢地談起了內地的情形來，他眞興奮栩了，他告訴我，淪陷區的工作是艱苦的，又像麻一樣的混亂。當地初到淪陷區的時候，人民逃光了，食糧也跟着人逃得一乾二凈，舉目所見的，是燒焦了的樓房，死寂的鄉村，蒼蠅和老鼠，統治了那些被敵人毀壞了的地區。被虐殺了的人民們的殘缺不全的屍體「隨處」爛着，野狗在舉行殘酷的歡　，血腥的氣味，夾在十二月凛冽的北風裏，更澈骨地直刺着，的腦神經，看見這種人間的慘劇，荒凉的原野過渡的激急和悲傷，政治工作人員心裏，即被深深的痛苦佔有了，經過了許多天的努力，工作人員才逐慚的把躱藏在山裏的農民們　囘來　，不斷的舉行鄕民大會，一條　一條村的幹着以民運工作者應具有的耐心幹着，才慢慢的有了民衆武裝的基礎，秩序漸漸恢復起來，並且有了很多的革新，人民開始自覺的擁護抗戰了，但是，有些地方却也很糟糕，軍民關係還沒開始新的建立人民害怕軍隊，也同樣害怕×人，漢好仍能公開活動，土匪的刧掠，走　的猖　，人民的失敗情緒，但　一方面，×人　卹了，人民就生了太平觀念，一旦「皇軍」掃蕩」了，就又極度的慌起來，人民沒有　織，比戰時還要散漫，他的結諭是，雖然情形是這樣，但，戰事確使許多東西有了改變，特別是最近，因爲×人又有舉行新「掃蕩」的消息，頑固的黑暗的歷史陳渣，也起了變化，人民在血的敎訓中慢慢懸醒了，整個的看來，一切都在開始變化，在開始新生……他說他也在開始新生。</p>
<p>「那麼，在工作中，你也憶戀這　濱的沙發嗎？」我問他。</p>
<p>「不，那巳經是過去了。我已經另找到一個沙發，那就是祖國的廣大的原野呀—當我初到內地時，我壹接觸那可愛的原野，一種從來未有的温暖而親切的感情，激劇地把我感動了。我第一次眞正感覺到祖國的偉大，我愛原野，雖然她正被×人蹂踐，敗　不堪，但她止用潛藏着的無限力量，在自己身上從事着自由的花朶的種植！』</p>
<p>「那麼，沙發這東西，，你離開後，從未有過眷戀嗎？』</p>
<p>「最初的時候，因爲生活轉換得太難於一下子適應起來，我是有過眷戀的。但不久，我便斷念了，我要向一切的人們宣告；回到內地去，在祖國的懷抱裏生活，戰鬥。她將使你感到無比的快樂，她將使你深感到自己是負祖光榮的創造世界的偉菐的。」他興奮得有點茫然了。恬靜而莊重的向窗外夜色，凝望着。自語般的說：「在這樣的大時代，沙發大概只有垂死的階層，才安心靜坐的吧。」</p>
<p>他走到案前倒了一杯茶，把它擎着，遐想似的選疑起來。說道：</p>
<p>「沙發在一定的場合，合理的埸合，把它當作瞬間的憩息，未嘗不可，』他一口把茶喝完，快活的嘆了一口氣：「但把它當作生活，就要消　人的意志的；而坐的人也會變成蠢狼一樣的東西了。』</p>
<p>我熱烈的贊成他的意見。我說：</p>
<p>「某種生活的人，把香港當作沙發，是確切的。但。這沙發的四週正瀰漫着硝煙哩！然而，不把她爲作沙發，沒有資格把她當作沙發的人，正多着，不爲沙發埋沒，切切實實的生活，是我們鬥爭的鉄則。只要人眞能那樣，這鐵則是到處鄱可引用……</p>
<p>看看錶，將近一點了。於是，我理快把床板拿來，給他安置一個睡覺的地方。</p>
<p>我指着那舗叠好的一塊板的床，向我的客人說：</p>
<p>「把它當作沙發吧！此刻你是應得憩息的』。</p>
<p>他抱着我，小孩子似的笑了。流風</p>
<h3>「沉默的凱旋」</h3>
<p>— 流風</p>
<p>帶着『沉　』而「凱旋』歸國，這似乎是世間並沒有的事。照理「凱旋一該是多麼的熱鬧呵——「舉國若狂』，「凱旋」將成爲不可思議的了。</p>
<p>然而，我們的友邦，却有着「沉默的凱旋」這一『玩意兒』，我把我們一友邦』的『沉默的凱旋』却叫做「玩　兒」的，倒並不是含有一絲一毫的諷嘲的意味在內，實在因爲這種「沉默的凱旋」是一種『首創』，而我的行文的措辭又是非常拙劣，一時找不到適當用辭，沒法，只得把『沉默的凱旋』當他作『玩意兒』了。</p>
<p>逼令女子學校里的姑娘們，拿着小小的紙國旗，婉轉着淸脆的歌喉，唱出勉强的愛國歌曲，激　着『出扯』的『軍人』，這在『友邦』的報紙上是渲染成爲一椿很是熱鬧的新聞。然而『出征』的『軍人』裝在瓶子里變作「骨灰」被帶囘來的時候，在「友邦」的「京都日日新聞」報紙上是稱做「沉默的凱旋」的！</p>
<p>「友邦」在我們中國國土七進行的「建設東亞新秩序」的戰爭，的確是在天天地勝利，這只要看他們自國內報章上天天有「沉默的凱旋」可見出來了。</p>
<p>「骨灰」當然不會『開口』，然而爲了完成『聖戰』而把自己的『生命』犧牲了，這旣然被報紙稱作「凱旋」，那末也當然是「沉默」的了。</p>
<p>不過『骨灰』旣已不會說話了，而與「骨灰」有關的至親好友，擴大之是「　灰』的「候補者』，與「眞理」的擁護者們他們却是會說話的。競是「京都日日新聞」上登載這一　沉　的　旋」中就是一段悲慘的「骨灰之語」。</p>
<p>那就是這位「沉默的凱旋者一的妻子，洗好澡，穿着整齊的衣服，到她這位「沉默的凱旋者」的丈夫的墓前去自殺。雖然后妻子的『自殺』，然而顯然是「骨灰」借了妻子的「自殺』而在作着一段「悲慘的控訴』向着全國的人民！</p>
<p>其外，東京街頭屢有發現的「反戰標語』，這也是一種「凱旋」的「沉默者』的『沉默之言』，至於大阪火藥　的爆炸，那是因天天「凱旋」而不忍「沉默』的一種「雷聲歡動一的表示了！</p>
<p>「凱旋」是永不會有『沉默』的，即使「京都日日新聞』上有，那也不過是『友邦』另一小部分人的「沉默的凱旋」吧？要不是，那就是一種因「三月』不能達到『目的』而在作着一種「自我安慰」了</p>
<p>「沉默的凱旋』，是日本法西斯軍閥所創舉，然而也是他們在中國唯一的所得！</p>
<h3>出發</h3>
<p>— 黃魯</p>
<p>爐火燃着枯葉</p>
<p>四壁闇味</p>
<p>因爲明天</p>
<p>我將到遠方去</p>
<p>母親呵！煩你</p>
<p>給我飼飽　匹馬</p>
<p>待隣里鷄啼時</p>
<p>我便要啓程</p>
<p>我將取下</p>
<p>祖父的馬刀</p>
<p>祖父的手槍</p>
<p>馳向黎明的遠方</p>
<h3>春煙</h3>
<p>— 何程江</p>
<p>春煙籠着海洋，春煙籠着靑山，春煙籠罩着大地，大地的人們，生活在春煙裏。</p>
<p>空際一片灰黯　漫的氣體，氳氤在海洋上，輸船減低了速率，慢吞吞的航行羞，燈塔之光，給氣體埋掩着，毫不淸晰。</p>
<p>人們抱着一顆『莫明其妙』心情，俯視着，仰望着，平看漪，一從這邊岸，看不見那邊岸，從這騎樓下的行人路，看過那邊行人路，便看不淸楚人們眞容。然而人海在橫流着。……</p>
<p>海，懶懶地躺着，毫無生氣地呼息着。……</p>
<p>我抱着一腔惆悵的心情在海邊，但我不會感到「陽春召我以煙景』的「可樂』；反之，我正悠得憤慨的是，祖國四野的狼煙！</p>
<p>—吁！</p>
<p>微微的太息了一下，我心充滿着祖國的懷念，我想窮我的目光，去翹望祖國的偉大底童容，但是，迷濛着海上的春煙，使我望祖國而不兒。</p>
<p>雖然，　多人樂得在這裏看不見祖國的烽火，聽不聞祖國的炮聲，昏沉沉的生活在　濛的春烟下，賞一簾烟雨，聽淸脆的賣花聲，徜徉於這世外桃源，然而我的心，正不在乎此。</p>
<p>祗渴望天中的白日，消滅了海上的春烟，否則一塲暴雨狂風，下個痛快，掀起了海洋的猛醒，掀起了海浪的怒吼，像燕趙壯士的悲歌，響震天宇之下，待雨止風停的時光，我們又重賭一輸白日滿天靑，也遠勝似悶沉沉籠在二層愁霧裏。</p>
<p>我惱春煙，我恨春煙，春天的煙景，迷惑了多少人，喪失了多少精神，消磨了幾許壯志？可惱的春煙！</p>
<p>呀！春煙我恨你，我惱你，迷漫在海上，迷漫在天空，使我看不見祖國，可是我底心，會穿過你的網羅，囘到祖國的胸膛裏去呢！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>他和她仍是站在原地。時間久了。他和她的肩上，巳經積起了雪層。幸而這路上他和她以外，不見第三個夜行者。他該感謝這雪夜死靜的路，代他隱藏着秘密。但誰敢保證長久的停留中而無意外發生？</p>
<p>自的雪地，黑的天空，非常單純而淸晰，彷彿正是他身心的兩面。他在這需白兩色的宇宙之閒，而感到自己的無能與渺小，他由於她不反抗的反抗，使自己深深地走上苦慮之境。殺死她嗎？她是無辜的，也不是原有的目的，而且，他工作的記錄，不仍是來時一樣的空白嗎？放走她嗎？固然是她的心願了，歡快地去了，那麼，他工作的成績，僅是一刀的傷痕嗎？永遠的停留嗎？停留是沒袖結果的吧？他沉默地搖起頭來。表示一切都給以否定。但是，肯定的呢？……</p>
<p>强者的嘆息，是珍貴的。最後，他輕輕地嘆息一聲，把低能的手槍不得不放進衣衾里，他知道它已經不能帮助自已，不如收起它而表示對於對方的重視。然後，他謹恤地走開兩步，盡量地收歛了怕怒和愁苦的臉色，而代以莫明的喜悅和謙順。</p>
<p>如果剛才他是最强者，那麼，他現在是最弱者了。前者，是自由飛走長空的天馬，他所見的，隨處部是坦途；後者，雖然是他，但是由於他一旦的不經心，被大雪，狂風，從天界打落，落後，又被縛了韁繩。他那强而無力的身體。在短短的距離間，不住地移來，移去。他直是被宗敎降服的信徒，帶着虔誠的心情，又走到她的面前，不住地說着好話：</p>
<p>「……我如果有冒犯你的地方，請你原諒我，原諒飢寒交迫的義勇軍吧……中國人是該帮助他們的，指導他們的……我這次來是請你去帮助他們，指導他們的……』</p>
<p>選好像在神像前的懺悔，乞求；這言語，是走向虛無中去的，結果是一無反響。</p>
<p>他爲了工作，而委屈了自己—但也有限度的。在超過這限度的時候，突然，他把她拖住，拖走她。　（廿六）</p>

<h3>Exposing the Darkness of Inducement to Surrender: China is Not Czechoslovakia or Spain!</h3>
<p>Since the war of resistance entered its second phase, in the past five months, the policy of the × people (Japanese) towards China has sometimes employed political peace inducement to surrender and sometimes military adventures, exhibiting a great sense of "indecision." Many who are ignorant of the general situation are also misled by this. In fact, the reason why the × people are acting in this way is very simple, that is, in the twenty months since the Sino-Japanese War, the situation at home and abroad in our country has been progressing and improving day by day, while the internal and external situation in Japan is just the opposite. A quick victory is impossible, and the conspiracy of a quick peace has also failed. Therefore, their actions are embarrassed and troubled, seeming unbearable to scrutinize. But if we can observe calmly, we can know that the difficulties of × are deepening, but have not deepened to the point of collapsing the entire aggressive camp, and have not deepened to the point of losing the power to continue the attack; our strength has indeed progressed, but has not progressed to the point of completely stopping the attack of the × people and recovering the lost land. Therefore, the × people are currently using military adventures as a backup for political conspiracies on the one hand, and using peace inducement to surrender to supplement the lack of military power on the other hand. Therefore, their "war" is indeed an adventure, and their "peace" is also without sincerity. Their purpose lies in preventing the political progress of our country, eliminating the strength of our resistance war, and realizing the complete "subjugation of China"! The smokescreens of "peace," "compromise," and "international mediation," etc., are constantly being released under this situation of the Japanese × people for the aforementioned attempt to conquer China. In the past few days, the × people's traitors have been releasing these smokescreens again, and the purpose also lies in this. This is our basic internal understanding that we should have.</p>
<p>The treacherous plans of "peace," "compromise," "international mediation," etc., which induce surrender, are obviously derived from the latest facts of the German and Italian annihilation of Czechoslovakia and the "conquest" of Spain. Therefore, although the general public already clearly knows the conspiracies and treacherous plans of the × people's traitors, they are also deeply concerned that China may unfortunately follow the footsteps of Czechoslovakia or Spain in the future. Therefore, the alarm bells of "a new Munich!" and "a Munich in the Far East!" are constantly being sounded. We should indeed raise our vigilance today to prevent the human tragedy of Munich from being staged in the Far East. But at the same time, we should still understand that any conspiracy to turn China into a second Czechoslovakia or Spain is impossible and futile. Why? We can briefly explain as follows:</p>
<p>First of all, we know that Czechoslovakia originally had no reason to be annihilated, because they had a great democratic tradition in politics, the people of the whole country supported the government in resisting aggression, and they also had a fairly strong army and solid national defense construction in the military. However, why did Czechoslovakia finally perish? This is because the internal unity of Czechoslovakia was insufficient, the forces protecting democracy were suspicious of each other, and a part of them openly befriended the enemy (Germany). The enemy also supported rebel parties such as Henlein in Czechoslovakia to create internal disruption. At the same time, in terms of international relations, although there was a Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, France was constrained by Britain and abandoned aid to Czechoslovakia. Britain even sent Runciman to pressure Czechoslovakia to yield. The Soviet Union also did not provide assistance because Czechoslovakia compromised midway and ultimately did not resist. These are the factors for the demise of Czechoslovakia. Now China already possesses more conditions than Czechoslovakia for not perishing, but does not have any of the factors for the fall of Czechoslovakia. The main thing is that our internal unity is becoming more and more consolidated, the phenomenon of suspicion and friction has almost disappeared, a part of the pro × (Japan) elements has been eliminated, and the lurking pro × elements are subject to unanimous national attack as soon as they make a move. Rebel parties such as Henlein have never been produced, and in terms of international relations, not only is there no strong country that openly pressures our country to yield, but also has a Soviet Union that resolutely aids China in resisting Japan, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the vast majority of peace-loving and just people in the world!</p>
<p>Secondly, let us look at Spain. Spain had even less reason to be conquered than Czechoslovakia. Because Spain has been resisting for more than thirty months, the people of the whole country unanimously support the Republican government to resist to the end, all parties in the country have also established a consolidated and united front, and have won the sympathy and assistance of the people all over the world. However, why was the Spanish resistance finally destroyed? And why was all of Spain actually "conquered" under the rule of the Franco regime, the hawk and dog of the German and Italian aggressors? This is because the enemies of Spain were not only the troops of the traitor Franco, but also the joint attack of the two major aggressive countries of Germany and Italy, and Franco's forces had already seized seven or eight tenths of the government's regular army from the beginning. How could they withstand the addition of hundreds of thousands of German and Italian elite troops and the latest weapons! At the same time, the British and French rulers had long pressed the Republican army with a policy of non-interference, blocking foreign aid to the Republican army, while Germany and Italy could continuously aid Franco, and finally even tried their best to undermine the Spanish People's Front and constantly provoke coups to destroy the Republican government. Finally, due to excessive international pressure, a few leaders of the Republican government, such as Casado and Miaja, betrayed and implemented anti-communist peace talks, which led to the recent tragic event of "being conquered." On the contrary, in our country, in terms of the domestic situation, we are large in land, rich in resources, and populous, which are far superior to Czechoslovakia and Spain, and are the main conditions for our resolute non-perishability. Secondly, in the twenty months since the start of our country's war of resistance, domestic unity has become increasingly consolidated, politics has become increasingly progressive, the economy has become increasingly developed, the army has continued to maintain more than two million soldiers, and has become increasingly strong, and new troops are being cultivated on a large scale! Our united front includes all parties, all ethnic minorities, especially all strata, and the party leading the united front has determined long-term close cooperation with ten years of experience. These conditions of victory are not only better than those of Czechoslovakia, but also better than those of Spain. In terms of the international situation, on the one hand, because the United Kingdom and France are considering their own interests, they not only cannot add pressure to us as they did to Czechoslovakia and Spain, but also adopt a positive approach to aid. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's aid to China is also greatly facilitated by geographical and political relations, and has a lasting guarantee. These are also the conditions of victory that Czechoslovakia and Spain did not have. In addition, the strength of our × people is not as strong as the combined forces of Germany and Italy attacking Czechoslovakia and Spain. The Chinese traitors and collaborators are also unable to match Henlein's shoulders, and are far from being one ten-thousandth of Franco's strength; these are the main conditions that we will never become Czechoslovakia or Spain.</p>
<p>From the comparison of the various concrete conditions above, we have already understood that even if the × traitors intensify their various steps of inducement to surrender, attempting to turn our country into a second Czechoslovakia or Spain, it will in fact be absolutely impossible. However, we are not saying that we can therefore allow the × people's conspiracies and treacherous plans of inducement to surrender to run rampant! No! If we allow it to run rampant, if we do not give it a thorough and fatal blow, then the future of our war of resistance and the future of the national liberation movement will inevitably encounter various unexpected obstacles and sufferings! Especially as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, our military and political offensive is not enough to stop the necessary degree of the × people's offensive. Therefore, even if we can already assert that the result of persevering in unity and resistance will be victory, the breadth, severity, and cruelty of the suffering we will suffer in this process will be unimaginable to us! How should we give the × traitors' conspiracy to induce surrender a thorough and fatal blow today? This is what we have repeatedly hoped for. We must strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front line and expand the guerrilla warfare behind the × people in the military. The most important thing is to realize democratic politics and improve the people's livelihood in politics, so as to effectively realize the total mobilization of the spirit and material strength of the whole nation.</p>
<h3>Children in Socialist Countries – Written in Commemoration of This Year's Children's Day –</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhen</p>
<p>The War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has entered a new stage. Commemorating "Children's Day" in this new stage feels exceptionally significant. We must strive to rescue suffering children in the war zones and those wandering throughout the country. We must strive to nurture children throughout the nation, nurturing the future masters of the new China. This newspaper published Ms. Shufen's article "Nurturing the Masters of the New China" on April 1st in advance, addressing how we should commemorate this year's Children's Day. Today, we are publishing this article by Mr. Mei Zhen, depicting the lives of children in the Soviet Union after the success of the socialist revolution and the government's measures to ensure the lives of children and women. On the one hand, it can serve as a reference for those who pay attention to children's issues today. On the other hand, it can greatly increase our courage and determination in the revolutionary struggle. We are specially introducing it to our readers.</p>
<p>I. Soviet Children After the Success of the Revolution</p>
<p>The success of the "October Socialist Revolution" laid the foundation for eliminating the social system of human exploitation and class oppression, and also laid the foundation for the complete and ultimate liberation of women. Following the smooth and complete completion of the first and second Five-Year Plans, the elimination of the exploitative social system was fully realized, and a classless social life was fully realized. Socialist construction in the Soviet Union was completely successful! Soviet children born after the success of the revolution, today's Soviet youth, have grown up entirely in a happy socialist society. All systems of human oppression and exploitation, as well as the deception, humiliation, exploitation, and slaughter, and the phenomena of class struggle that we often suffer in capitalist and semi-feudal, semi-colonial societies, Soviet children and youth can only see in newspapers. Consequently, they imagine its cruelty and are filled with righteous indignation, expressing their grievances for the working masses!</p>
<p>The happy lives of Soviet children, growing up happily in a socialist society, are simply unimaginable for capitalist countries, let alone for the children of semi-feudal, semi-colonial China. Even when they are still in their mothers' wombs, they enjoy the protection of the socialist Soviet government's laws, receiving protection from anti-abortion laws that are completely different from those in capitalist and feudal countries. As soon as they leave the womb, they not only gain the protection of laws ensuring complete equality between men and women in all political, social, and family life, but also immediately receive the protection of Soviet government regulations for rewarding child-rearing subsidies. This government legal protection not only benefits children but also practically benefits children's parents, especially mothers. They can receive special government treatment.</p>
<p>Soviet children, from the moment they are born, can immediately enjoy the preferential treatment of nurseries, kindergartens, and schools at all levels, all with specialized government facilities, without their parents having to worry. At the same time, they still enjoy family happiness; they still enjoy the warmth of the family in the evenings and on holidays. However, in addition to family happiness, what is even more commendable is collective, larger-scale happiness. Furthermore, they enjoy all sorts of entertainment unimaginable in capitalist and feudal countries. The forms and contents are revolutionary, full of future ideals, and by no means fantasies: various dances, dramas, movies, and even the world's leading sports, as well as gliding, parachuting, and other games. These games are almost unattainable for capitalist youth, and even more unattainable for Chinese youth and even military officers. However, in the Soviet Union, they have become common games for children!</p>
<p>Soviet children live such happy lives until they enter adulthood. At the same time, they are definitely not treated as toy-like little birds or butterflies. No, they also possess independent personalities that are unprecedented in other capitalist and all countries. Although they are guided by socialist education to embark on the path of defending socialism and defending the progress of human culture, they also gain natural human development. Whether in daily life, in games and entertainment, or in all social services, they have ample opportunities to exercise their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity.</p>
<p>Until they enter adulthood, they can continue to develop their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity towards life, politics, and society. However, at that time, in addition to obtaining the freedoms such as political democracy granted by the government, they also gain what people in capitalist countries and other countries do not enjoy: truly equal conditions of material life for men and women, without class distinctions, uniformly improved working conditions, reduced working hours, rapid medical progress, and increased cultural entertainment!</p>
<p>In particular, from early childhood, they are educated and prepared to fight for the defense of the socialist motherland, for the interests of the oppressed masses worldwide, for the liberation of small and weak nations, and for the defense of world peace and the progress of human culture.</p>
<p>(II) Soviet Laws Protecting Women and Children</p>
<p>When discussing Soviet laws protecting women and children, the first thing to mention is the law prohibiting abortion.</p>
<p>In the years following the civil war and international armed intervention, the Soviet domestic economy collapsed. The inadequate cultural level inherited by women from before the revolution prevented them from immediately fully utilizing the rights granted to them by law, and also prevented them from immediately assuming the tasks of producing and educating children, and of being citizens and mothers without worry. At that time, as long as the situation met the criteria specified in the resolution of the People's Committee for Health and Justice of November 18, 1920, which stated that "the moral legacy of the past and the difficult economic situation of the present still compel some women to resort to this operation," women were permitted to have abortions.</p>
<p>The revolutionary leaders of the Soviet Union firmly opposed abortion. Lenin, in a 1913 article, stated that class-conscious workers "are undoubtedly enemies of neo-Malthusianism. This doctrine caters to the desires of cowardly and self-abnegating philistines who shudderingly whisper: 'May God keep our bodies and souls always together. As for children, it is better to have none.'" However, while Lenin regarded abortion as a social evil, he also pointed out that any legislation prohibiting abortion would clearly be ineffective. He also pointed out that under capitalism, laws prohibiting abortion only reflect the "hypocrisy of the ruling class" because these laws "cannot heal the sores of capitalism, but instead turn them into a special malignancy, into a special wound for the oppressed class." Only under socialism, where the phenomenon of human exploitation no longer exists, where women have become equal members of society, and where the improvement of the material welfare of the working people has become the law of social development, is it possible to solemnly organize the struggle against abortion—by law or other means.</p>
<p>The resolution of the People's Committees for Health and Justice of November 18, 1920, which permitted abortion, was eventually revised. Furthermore, on the one hand, the necessary material reserves for women and their children were realized, subsidies for large families were realized, and the networks of maternity wards, nurseries, and kindergartens were greatly developed, as well as the explicit stipulation of the minimum amount of child support that fathers must pay after separation from their spouses. On the other hand, abortion was prohibited, the criminal law for deliberately failing to pay child support as determined by the court was aggravated, and certain legislative amendments were proposed during divorce. They resolutely opposed attitudes that trivialize family and family obligations! These are the paths that must be followed regarding the important issues of the entire population. The Soviet government responded to the appeals made by many working women.</p>
<p>First, regarding the prohibition of abortion, the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union decided on the following legal act on June 27, 1936: (1) Because of the proven harm, the two committees decided to strictly prohibit abortion, whether in hospitals and special health institutions, or in doctors' homes and pregnant women's private homes. However, abortion may be specifically permitted when pregnancy endangers life or there is a risk of harming the pregnant woman's health, as well as when serious parental illness can be transmitted to the fetus, but it must be performed in a hospital or maternity ward. (2) If abortion is performed outside of a hospital or if anyone in the hospital violates the above abortion behavior, the doctor performing the abortion shall be sentenced to imprisonment for one to two years. If the abortion behavior is performed by a person without special medical education under unhygienic conditions, they shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years. (3) If a woman is forced to have an abortion, she shall be sentenced to two years of imprisonment. (4) For pregnant women who violate the prohibition of abortion, the two committees stipulated social condemnation instead of criminal law. If there is a recurrence, a fine of no more than 300 rubles shall be imposed.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the protection of pregnant women and the encouragement of childbirth, the two committees decided on the following legal act: (1) In order to improve the material status of women (female workers and employees) insured by social insurance organizations, the two committees decided to increase the allowance prepared for necessary childcare from the state's social insurance fund from 32 rubles to 45 rubles. (2) The two committees decided to increase the breastfeeding allowance issued to mothers from 5 rubles per month to 10 rubles. (3) For uninsured working women (members of cooperative combinations and cooperative enterprises), it is stipulated that the above-mentioned allowances shall be issued by the cooperative mutual aid fund on an equal basis. (4) Abolish the restrictions imposed on female employees by the Labor Code, so that they are equal to working women in terms of the length of prenatal and postnatal leave (56 days before birth and 56 days after birth). (5) Formulate criminal laws for refusing to hire pregnant women and reducing pregnant women's wages, and stipulate in the law that when transferring a pregnant woman to lighter work, the employer has the obligation to maintain her original wage earned in the most recent six months. (6) Formulate state subsidies for mothers with large families. A mother who already has six children will receive an annual subsidy of 2,000 rubles for each additional child until the child is five years old. A mother who already has ten children will receive a one-time state subsidy of 5,000 rubles for each additional child, and then an annual subsidy of 3,000 rubles until the child is four years old. (One ruble is approximately one Taiwan or Hong Kong dollar.)</p>
<p>III. How the Soviet Union Loves Children</p>
<p>Soviet children, from the moment they are born, receive the love of government laws in addition to the affection of their parents, older brothers, and older sisters. For example, the networks of maternity wards, nurseries, and kindergartens all over the country are carefully arranged by the government in response to the needs of the people.</p>
<p>The aforementioned two committees simultaneously instructed the People's Committees for Health of all federal republics to carry out the following tasks: (1) In order to provide special medical assistance in special maternity wards to all women in urban industrial centers and local centers, each People's Committee for Health shall, before January 1, 1939, set up 110,000 new maternity beds. (2) In order to expand medical services for pregnant women in rural villages, each People's Committee for Health should set up and put into use 32,000 maternity beds. (3) In order to provide midwifery services at home for women who do not go to maternity hospitals, each People's Committee for Health should open 14,000 new midwife stations before January 1, 1938. The above is about expanding the maternity ward network. Secondly, regarding the promotion of nurseries, (1) the two committees decided to double the existing nursery bed network in cities, state-owned farms, workers' districts, and railways before January 1, 1939, with the total number of beds increasing to 800,000. (2) Before the same date, double the existing nursery bed network in rural collective farm nurseries and seasonal collective farm nurseries, so that the number of beds in regular nurseries increases by 500,000, and the number of beds in seasonal nurseries increases by 400,000. (3) In urban areas and industrial centers, from January 1, 1937, the work of nursery schools is rotated by two shifts of personnel. (4) In addition to the training expenses for intermediate personnel, another 15 million rubles will be allocated, instructing the People's Committees for Health of all federal republics to cultivate suitable talents for newly established institutions. (5) Before January 1, 1939, each Republican Health Committee will add 800 new milk kitchens in cities, industrial centers, and local centers to feed 1.5 million children under the age of three. Again, regarding the expansion of kindergartens, the Soviet Union completed the following plan from 1936 to 1938: (1) Expand the existing regular kindergarten network in cities, factory areas, and railways to three times its original size, increasing it to 2.1 million places before January 1, 1938; in state-owned farms and state-owned institutions in rural areas, increase it to 300,000 places. (2) Before the New Year of 1936, in addition to the existing 400,000 places, add 700,000 additional kindergarten places on collective farms, and at the same time establish seasonal playgrounds for all children of collective farms who have not reached school age. Established 23 million places. The education committees of each republic trained 50,000 teachers for those kindergartens that will be opened in the second half of 1936, and allocated an additional 35 million rubles to fund the training of cadres for new kindergartens in just this half year.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to reduce the burden on mothers with many children, the Soviet Union has given these mothers large amounts of subsidies. As of April 1, 1937, 260,000 mothers had received subsidies, totaling 566 million rubles. In addition, the number of gynecological and pediatric medical clinics and infant and child protection offices was only 9 before the revolution until 1911, but by 1935, there were 3,945 of the former, with 3.4 million people receiving treatment, and 794 of the latter, with 17 million people receiving treatment! These institutions are all equipped with exquisite laboratories, X-rays, and other advanced medical equipment.</p>
<p>IV. The Cultural Life and Entertainment of Soviet Children</p>
<p>The cultural life and entertainment life of Soviet children are worthy of boasting to the capitalist world. The number of schools specially run for children in the Soviet Union is noteworthy. Before the revolution, there were only 103,000 primary schools, with 7 million students, 1,600 incomplete secondary schools, with 200,000 students, and 1,800 secondary schools, with 600,000 students. Several years later, in 1935-1936, there were 126,600 primary schools, with 11 million students, 31,500 incomplete secondary schools, with 10 million students, and 6,000 secondary schools, with 4.5 million students. In addition, there are more than 700 workers' colleges, teaching secondary education, with 250,000 students. In 1936-1937, the number of students in primary and secondary schools increased to 28,842,000. Now that the second Five-Year Plan has been completed and the third Five-Year Plan has begun, more emphasis is placed on improving the standard of living and cultural life, and the quantity will increase several times. School enrollment for students in Soviet schools is completely free. Schools are generally established by the state. Some primary and secondary school students are also subsidized for lunch by the school. Students in specialized schools and universities do not pay tuition fees and also receive subsidies. And women's access to education has also reached an equal footing. For example, in 193_ each girls in primary and secondary schools accounted for 48 percent of the total number.</p>
<p>Russia was known for its poverty, but the development of Soviet Russia's cultural publishing industry has become incredible to the world. Regarding children, in order to implement correct and appropriate education for children, various languages of children's books, magazines, and telegrams are specially published for children. In 1934, there were 10.5 million copies of children's literature books, 16.4 million copies in 1935, and 32.1 million copies in 1936. There were 19 million copies of children's magazines in 1935 and 30.7 million copies in 1936. There are hundreds of kinds of children's and teenagers' magazines. As for children's newspapers, almost every town, township, village, neighborhood, and even primary school and kindergarten has one!</p>
<p>Speaking of the entertainment life of Soviet children, it is even more interesting. The Soviet Union has special theaters, cinemas, and circuses for children. In order to provide children with correct education in the field of drama, most ordinary adult theaters do not accept children. At the end of 1936, there were 100 ordinary theaters and circuses exclusively for children and young people. In addition, children's gardens are set up in streets and forests, and children's equipment such as遊toys, libraries, and zoos are available in the park. Especially in winter, children participate in ice skating. It is simply a daily entertainment for every child. In Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkiv, and other cities, there are also children's palaces, which are specially equipped to inspire children to study various domestic and international subjects, and to recruit talented children to develop their talents. These children's palaces are currently being built in various cities and collective farms. As for summer, children have two months of vacation. The vast majority of children leave the city to live in the suburbs in the summer and receive the tempering of nature. There are also children selected from all over the country who are studying well (shock troops) to spend two months at the children's camp in Ortek, by the Russian sea. This is one of the larger and better-equipped places for children to collectively recuperate. All expenses for children, including travel expenses, clothing, etc., are not borne by themselves. There, the flag is raised at 7:00 every day, there are three regular meals and three refreshments every day, and a one-hour nap is required after lunch. Every day, they must swim and sunbathe, and the rest of the time is spent on various scientific specialized research that each child is interested in, collecting various animals and plants to make specimens, researching how to make airplanes and build tanks, or taking short trips during travel. Some children have also made inventions related to machines. They have various specialized instructors guiding them. When individuals or groups go to visit them there, they are all hospitably received. After refreshments, they gather together to perform songs and dances. During the break, they also compete with each other to increase their weight. Those who have a good break are also rewarded.</p>
<p>(V) Foreign Children Living in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>"Do you also want to go to the Soviet Union?" Children of any country, when talking about the life of Soviet children, cannot help but think of going to this red Soviet Union. In fact, there is no country in the world that welcomes foreign children to travel as much as the Soviet Union! What's more, the Soviet Union itself is a union of seven socialist republics and many other free states. Their country also has hundreds of ethnic groups!</p>
<p>Since the German aggressor's henchman Franco launched a war in the Spanish Republic, the children have suffered the same bombings, knife and gun killings as we Chinese are suffering today. There are even more thousands of people who are hungry, wandering, and dying! Democratic and peaceful countries launched a campaign to rescue Spanish children in distress the year before last. The Soviet Union, a socialist country, naturally supports and assists even more vigorously. Now, more than 100,000 Spanish children in distress have been safely taken to the Soviet Union. Some have even moved entire schools to the Soviet Union. All the faculty and staff of the school were originally hired in Spain. The original Spanish education is carried out in Spanish language and script. This kind of school is especially favored by the Soviet government. For the rest of the children in distress, the Soviet government organized them and established schools for them. Most of the teachers are also Spanish, and the teaching materials and books are entirely in Spanish. The Soviet Union issued them uniform uniforms, which are neat and beautiful, and provided them with all supplies. Some of the children's fathers are still fighting in Spain. They can use the radio to talk to their parents and contact their families as if they were at home.</p>
<p>In addition, the children of revolutionaries from various countries who stayed in the Soviet Union also enjoy various rights like Soviet children. There are also many children of Chinese revolutionaries there! They are all in the international children's nurseries and schools established by the International Relief Organization for Revolutionaries. Although their faces are different in black, white, brown, yellow and red, they get along very harmoniously and kindly. They are healthy, lively, and intelligent in this happy paradise, and the institutions that nurture them not only pay close attention to their daily life, diet, learning, and entertainment, but also try their best to make them not forget their motherland and often educate them to love their motherland and love their vast compatriots and the sufferers of the world.</p>
<p>Since our war of resistance, the Japanese aggressors have used airplanes and artillery to create thousands of infant corpses and child corpses and thousands of orphans. We have a vast rear area, especially the southwest and northwest. Our children do not need to flee to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has done its best to help us spiritually and by raising medical donations. We also have hundreds and thousands of outstanding children and young people who have been sent to the Soviet Union to learn specialized sciences and aircraft manufacturing and piloting. Let us look forward to their great success here!</p>
<h3>Chengdu Unveils the Curtain on Military Build-up (1)</h3>
<p>— Zi Fei</p>
<p>[Special Chengdu Airmail Report] The weather on March 5th was particularly clear and bright; the people of Chengdu, who had not seen the sun for many days, were exceptionally delighted, especially on this day of the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>The Jinshui River (a river within Chengdu City) brought countless ripples from Huanhua Creek (where the Jinshui River originates), slowly pacing and gurgling through the city; enticing the weeping willows on both banks to open their weary eyes, dress in new, soft green attire, and greet people with smiles. "Happy!" "Extremely fun!" Everywhere, men and women were shouting. Indeed, after days of "dogs barking at the sun," the sudden clarity of ten thousand miles without a cloud was truly indescribable joy. Moreover, it was both the Lantern Festival and a Sunday, and the "Chengdu Cultural Circles Military Build-up Joint Movement Publicity Week," which had never been written in Chinese history before.</p>
<p>While wealthy wives, young ladies, gentlemen seeking refuge, and big shots hoping for a quick victory were still pursuing sweet dreams, there was a constant sound of gongs on the streets; following the sound came the announcement: "Fellow neighbors, everyone on the street! The Police Bureau orders that today is the opening day of the * Military Build-up Publicity Week, and every household must hang the national flag." After the voice stopped, there was again the sound of gongs.</p>
<p>National flags fluttered at the entrance of every house. Smiles appeared on everyone's faces. Chengdu today was completely different from usual. Banners of various colors were hung across the main roads; some read: "Build an army of ten million, restore our rivers and mountains," while others read "Mobilize all our strength, dedicate it to the country," "Everyone should be a soldier, victory in the war of resistance is certain," "Everyone should contribute, nation-building will surely succeed," and "...". Innumerable patriotic slogans were written. People rushed to Shaocheng Park. National flags fluttered freely in the pleasant spring breeze.</p>
<p>The Military Build-up Publicity Conference was held in Shaocheng Park.</p>
<p>When people walked to the entrance of Cishi Street, they saw a very large human-shaped lantern, with a blood-red mouth, extending an arm more than two zhang long, tightly clenching a fist. Below the fist, along the arm, was written: "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves." Looking at it, you would inevitably ask yourself: "Have I risen up in the war of resistance? Or not?" A red and white banner stretched across the street below the fist, reading "Build 5,000 airplanes to strengthen national defense." Above the main gate, in white cloth with black characters, was a horizontal inscription saying, "Sichuan has abundant land and people. Contribute troops and grain, be a model for the whole country." On the right was a map of China drawn by the Political Department of the Air Force Commission, depicting the resistance strength and dynamics of various provinces and ethnic groups, which hundreds of spectators looked up at with great interest.

<h3>National Muslim Compatriots Unanimously Support the War of Resistance; × Sends Traitors Impersonating Muslim Representatives to Mecca to Deceive Muslims from Various Countries</h3>

After they arrived in Mecca and learned about this, they strongly defended themselves to all parties, explaining the situation of our Muslim families in our country uniting as one, and announced the Japanese × killing and arson, in making Muslims and mosques, etc. After that, Zhao Weiyun, a Muslim youth studying in Egypt, also wrote a booklet in Arabic, strongly refuting their slander and shamelessness, and detailing the elimination of the situation where the country is united in one heart and bravely resisting the war.

<h3>The Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association is Established: Four Democratic Nations Cling Together Under Oppression, Aggression, Plunder, and Threat</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Dispatch] In the torrent of the War of Resistance, a truth about human survival has been revealed—that is, the indivisibility of freedom, peace, and war. Today, when the crisis in China and Europe, especially in Eastern Europe, is intensifying, this truth is further proven. The countries in Europe that love freedom, peace, and justice—France, Belgium, and Switzerland—have the same rational national character as our country and are also facing the same threats of oppression, aggression, and plunder as we are. It is in this situation that we have deepened our mutual understanding and strengthened our cooperation. Worthy of attention is the grand establishment of the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association on March 26.</p>
<p>Among those present were members of the presidium, including Weng Wenhao, Xie Guansheng, and Mao Qingxiang; Qiao Buke, the Counselor of the French Consulate; Xue Wen, the Chargé d'Affaires of Belgium; guests; Bishop Luo Dunwei; and members Bi Xiushao, Tong Mengsheng, Chen Zhonghao, and Yuan Yaoguo, totaling more than two hundred people.</p>
<p>Minister Weng Wenhao delivered the opening speech in fluent French. He said that no country in the world is isolated; they need the help of sympathy and friendship to stand firm. China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland are all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries. Now that we have the organization of this association, we naturally have high hopes for the promotion of future diplomatic relations. Yi Xihong briefly reported on the preparations, saying that the preparatory work went very smoothly, taking less than three months from initiation to establishment. Following him, a representative from the Central Department of Social Affairs spoke, emphasizing three points: First, to hope for the organization of society; second, to rationalize undertakings; and third, to introduce the unique national spirit of France, Belgium, and Switzerland to help the War of Resistance and promote its spiritual mobilization. The representative of the Ministry of Education expressed special gratitude to France, Belgium, and Switzerland for their assistance to China because their numbers in the Far East are dwindling. It is truly commendable that they can resist Japan with their spirit of freedom, peace, and justice, and with an attitude of doing what is right without seeking personal gain. The Ministry of Education is launching cultural lectures on various countries in major regions and systematically introducing famous works from various countries, expecting the support of the members present today. Dean Qin Zhen and representatives from the political circles also delivered very meaningful speeches, generally saying that freedom, equality, and fraternity are the highest cultures and thoughts of mankind. The "Decameron" of the West and China in the East were the first to have such cultural thoughts. Based on this ideological foundation, the four countries can unite and attack Japan, a barbaric country that destroys world peace.</p>
<p>Picquet, the Counselor of the French Embassy, first spoke amid applause that resounded throughout the hall. He said that Sino-French relations have always maintained friendly relations in the past. Now, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of those involved in the cultural work of various countries, a regular contact has been established, and future emotions will naturally be very good. Seven, the Counselor of the Belgian Embassy, said in a humorous tone that the four countries of China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland have a close relationship that complements each other, like water, fire, earth, and air. Their existence has created the world, and the cooperation of China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland is also an important factor in creating the world and promoting civilization. Madame Xia Ming, Li Meng, Havas News Agency, and Biyiait all delivered speeches, believing that the future cultural exchanges between the four countries of China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland will be beneficial to the creation of the world.</p>
<p>In the midst of laughter and applause, a clear symbol emerged, leaving a deep impression on me—the exchange of the great world's freedom, peace, and sense of justice!</p>
<p>After the speeches, the charter was adopted, and directors were elected. The venue was filled with a harmonious and friendly spirit. The honorary speakers of the association are Ma Xiangbo, Li Yuying, Zhang Renjie, Zhang Ji, Helio, and Qi Lan Mengda, among others. Wu Jingheng is the president, and the honorary directors are Wang Chonghui, the French Ambassador, Si Mo; the Belgian Ambassador, Ji Youmu; the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires, Dong Zinen; Zou Lu, Ye Shicang, Jun Lizi, Chen Lifu, Weng Wenhao, Wei Jingming, Li Shuhua, Gu Weijun, Qian Xun, Hu Shilu, Gao Lu, Xie Guansheng, Zhang Daohuai, Wei Huai, Chen Cheng, He Jian, Ma Chaojun, Dong Xianguang, Xie Choukang, Lu Zhengxiang, Yu Can, Lei Mingyuan, Wang Jingqi, Liu Wendao, Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Enlai, Bi Yuzhang, Li Qiong, Mai Huanzhang, Qin Huifang, Li Linyu, Xiong Guanglai, He Lu, Duan Tiaoyuan, Liao Pinzhuo, Hong Lanyou, and Mao Qingxiang, among others.

<h3>The Awkward Predicament of Puppet Suiyuan ×</h3>
<p>— Gao Lu</p>
<p>[Huan Yuan Dispatch] Due to Suiyuan's special international status in the Northwest, it has long been coveted by the Japanese ×. They use Inner Mongolia, Yu Gong, and bandits as their tools and pawns for aggression, engaging in political disintegration. In 1936, the × Kou intensified their aggression against Suiyuan, and only then did we have the glorious page in our history of liberation of General Fu Zuoyi's War of Resistance in eastern Suiyuan. After the flames of the Lugou Bridge Incident were ignited, except for the Yikezhao League and a part of western Suiyuan, which can still serve as a strict national defense barrier, most of Suiyuan's cities and transportation lines—the Pinghan Road—are controlled by the devilish hands of the × people. The protagonists who perform this cruel demonic play are the puppet Mongolian troops who are tempted and coerced. The real Japanese × are only a small number who occupy a supervisory position in the army.</p>
<p>Reaching the present, it has become an exhausted crossbow, full of awkwardness!</p>
<p>Due to the persistent resistance and heroic struggle of our regular army, guerrilla forces, and self-defense forces in Suiyuan, the × people have been trapped in dangerous cities for a year, desperately defending the main railway lines, not daring to cross the line. Every time they went out, they were attacked by our guerrillas. According to people from Baotou, the distribution of the × puppet army in Suiyuan is as follows:</p>
<p>First Division—Around Baotou Machi, including the × puppet army's Tanaka Detachment and the puppet army's Ding Qichang's unit.</p>
<p>Second Division and Third Division—Stationed in the Taolin Wuchuan area.</p>
<p>Fourth Division, Baoguima Unit—Branched out to the Daxue Bay, Shaxian area.</p>
<p>Fifth Division, Seben Unit—Stationed in the Guyang area.</p>
<p>Sixth Division and Seventh Division—Stationed in Pingdiquan, Fengzhen area.</p>
<p>Eighth Division—Stationed in the Qingshuihe area.</p>
<p>Ninth Division—Stationed in Tuoxian.</p>
<p>Yu Zhiqian's Anti-Communist Autonomous Army—Stationed in the Guyang area.</p>
<p>The Mongolian puppet army once occupied the Zhunge National Banner but was driven across the river by the advancing army. The puppet Mongolian army of Hangjin Banner was also driven away by the Suiyuan National Army. When the Senge unit attacked Dongsheng, we took advantage of the victory to drive all the puppet rebel army out of Dalate Banner, so that the flags of Yikezhao League were free from the harassment, ravaging, and exploitation of the × puppet army.</p>
<p>The troops stationed in Suiyuan by the × puppet army, nominally a large division, actually only have nine or six hundred people (including both Japanese and puppet Mongolian troops) or three or four hundred people. For example, Baotou, nominally the First Division, actually only has a Tanaka Detachment and Ding Qichang's four hundred-odd people.</p>
<p>Especially as the Japanese × deepen inland, the battle line becomes longer and longer, and the military strength is not enough to distribute. The × army in Suiyuan is particularly distressed by the distribution of military strength; in every fierce battle, they feel that they cannot take care of both ends. Therefore, in a predicament, they recently reorganized the scattered bandit teams in Hedong into the Northwest Autonomous Army. Li Ni Zhaoxing serves as the division commander and is currently stationed in Shaerqin, Eerxun, Haidai, Tuheqi, Balagai, Youfang Congzi, and other places between Baotou and Saer. However, the puppet army is ultimately Chinese, constantly remembering his motherland and secretly brewing a rebellion. According to a Mongolian youth who followed the Japanese back to China and arrived in Yu, the youth in the puppet army are eagerly missing their motherland. The subordinates of Prince De asked Prince De: "What should I do?" And Prince De is also gray-haired, unable to withstand the pressure of the Japanese. In this situation: the Japanese × are unusually worried, and the × people suspect the Han Chinese officers. In addition to a large number of deserters, the officers of each regiment are transferred to each other from time to time, and the vacancies are replaced by Mongolian people from the puppet headquarters' officer training corps. However, they are still afraid that they are unreliable, and the daily surveillance is extremely strict.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese × arrived in Suiyuan, they have made no progress in a year and have suffered painful wounds at the same time. At the same time, the × country is in turmoil, and the military's labor is high. According to people from Baotou: "The × soldiers' aversion to war is increasing day by day. A few days ago, × soldiers, including those in the city, gathered to drink alcohol. After drinking, they cried out loud and said to each other: "We cannot return to our country; we must die in China. We hope that the government will make peace quickly." According to the × counselor of the Mongolian Banner Pacification Envoy's Office, four or five × soldiers who graduated from university and worked in the special agency forcibly occupied the house of Gao, the counselor in Baotou. The wife of a certain counselor had no choice but to say: "We are slaves to a fallen country and have to let people live in the house." The × soldiers were very moved and said: "We are the real slaves of a fallen country."</p>
<p>Since the battles of Xincheng, the puppet army in Baotou has become more panicked. At the same time, there are no troops to come to aid from other places, so they have come up with several wonderful methods, such as making many wooden figures and standing them in the courtyards where they are stationed, or piling up sacks of hemp and soil at various street and road junctions to defend. At night, they wear the clothes of our Hui people to prepare for the guerrillas so that they can escape when attacked. From this point of view, the awkwardness of the × puppet army in Suiyuan is fully exposed, and the time of its disintegration is not far away. (Minge News Agency)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Speech: Abolishing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Responding to Britain with a Provocative Attitude, Using Oppression as an Excuse to Continue Expanding the Army</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] Hitler gave a speech here today, saying that Britain has no right to interfere in Germany's internal affairs. "When the residents of the state of Paris defend their homeland, on what basis do the British shoot them? We have not injured thousands of lives in Central Europe. What we have done is for the peace-loving people." Regarding the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Hitler said, "If Britain does not intend to adhere to peace, then all the practical prerequisites in the treaty have lost their effect." He also said that "those who take chestnuts from the fire" are only enough to burn their own hands. "We have a strong country to back up its rights. We do not have to rely on the goodwill of other countries or foreign politicians." Hitler's speech lasted for an hour, and it was interrupted by shouts of "shame" every time. When he mentioned Britain, the audience showed contempt. The speech also caused laughter. Hitler then spoke about Germany's territorial demands on Czechoslovakia, saying, "When Britain was still very small, the first German emperor was crowned in Prague. If Czechoslovakia has not oppressed the Germans and has not become a tool of communism, we have no hostility towards Czechoslovakia's independence." Regarding the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Hitler said, "We did this by using Germany's original rights, historical instructions, and our geographical location. We have no intention of suppressing the Czechs. The Czech people will enjoy more freedom than other so-called 'pure nations.' I dare say that this move has made a great contribution to peace, because the German-Czech annexation has invisibly eliminated a major crisis in Central Europe. Germany has never had the delusion of attacking other countries. We only seek to develop our own economic interests. Germany, like a large buyer of goods, is the most ideal economic partner. As for armaments, Germany will not stop expanding its army as long as other countries do not abandon their policy of oppressing Germany. I firmly believe that my country's progress can be faster than other countries. As for the Axis relationship in diplomacy, it will always be maintained under any circumstances and at any time. This is the most natural political tool in the world. Reports from the outside world that the Axis has broken up are absurd. If there are irreconcilable or psychological contradictions between Britain and the Soviet Union, I congratulate those who say this." Hitler then discussed the rights of Franco's army in Spain, saying that it was a victory for a country to be freed from the shackles of communism, and he was deeply proud of the German youth's contribution to the Spanish Civil War. Hitler cited Germany's pre-war history, calling it a struggle for a place in the sun. He then said that although Germany only followed its peaceful steps, other countries opposed it with resentment and accusations, which eventually led to war. Then, the head of state enumerated the cruel policies taken by other countries against Germany and continued to say that Britain had stated that "subjugating Germany would give the British great hope." Hitler also declared that no one could admit that he had defeated the heroic Germany. Then, he recounted President Wilson's "Fourteen Points," saying that Germany fully hoped to conclude a peace treaty under the conditions of no victors and no losers, no responsibility for compensation for losses, no plunder of colonies, and joint disarmament. Germany first implemented disarmament, and other countries should also follow. All issues must be discussed freely and openly, and most importantly, Germany has the right to make its own decisions. Germany firmly believed in this guarantee. Unexpectedly, all countries have now reneged on their promises, creating an unprecedented record. Europe has become a land of sin, where oppression and plunder are rampant.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] During Hitler's speech, he announced the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, saying that the purpose of the treaty no longer exists. He defended Germany's Central European policy, saying that Germany's policy has been to maintain peace until now. Germany is now on guard, and Britain's policy of encircling Germany is contradictory to the highest interests of Europe. Britain's conspiracy to overthrow Germany will never succeed. He also mentioned the last European war, saying that Germany was not defeated, and no one will be able to defeat Germany in the future. Some news said that Hitler's expression was impatient and extremely uneasy during his speech, which was very different from his usual voice.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] Hitler responded to Britain with a provocative attitude, saying that if Britain wants war, he is ready to deal with it, and declared that Chamberlain's current attitude will destroy the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Munich Four-Power Agreement. Hitler also said, "If British politicians say that this issue should be resolved through negotiations, I dare say that there have been fifteen years for you to work hard." The politician in the words refers to Chamberlain. Regarding the issue of countries competing to expand their armies, Hitler said, "If other countries want to rearm, others will never be able to stop us from doing the same." Then, he announced that the National Socialist Party Congress to be held in Nuremberg in September of this year will be named the "Peace Congress." Finally, he said, "Today, the time has come to test our strength. The entire German people are ready to mobilize at any time."</p>
<p>The United States Supports Democratic Countries in Wartime</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] According to those who listened to Hitler's shortwave broadcast here last night, the shortwave broadcast of the speech was interrupted for a short time shortly after Hitler began his speech.</p>
<p>[London, 1st] Foreign news: The response of Hitler to the declaration of Chamberlain is now being awaited here. It is reported that the original speech of Hitler was scheduled for only fifteen minutes, but it was extended to more than one hour. It was not completed until 5 o'clock (about 2:30 a.m. on the 2nd of this port's time), which shows the importance of Hitler's speech this time. The general public is prepared to give it a deep impression. News from Berlin said that although the reporters from various countries who participated in the launching ceremony in Wilhelmshaven were given a copy of Hitler's speech, they were required to leave the town hall only after Hitler's speech was completed. The spread of this news made the atmosphere here even more tense. Since the day before yesterday, the diplomatic contacts of European capitals have continued unabated, both on the democratic countries' side and on the Axis countries' side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British authorities have not yet made any statement on Hitler's speech. They will have to study the full text in detail before making a comment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Hitler's speech openly accepted Britain's challenge against aggression. Hitler refuted Britain point by point and threatened to cancel the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. This is the best way Hitler believes to threaten Britain. Hitler's speech has clearly divided the two major opposing camps in Europe. This is what Britain has repeatedly tried to avoid but could not achieve. The relationship between Britain and Germany has never been as tense as it is now since the end of the continuous war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] Senator Pittman declared today that Chamberlain's guarantee to Poland has opened the way to European peace. He also said that the U.S. government has recently indicated that in the event of war, the United States is very likely to support democratic countries, or to stop Hitler's future land grabs.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Senator Pittman declared that our government and most of the people are strongly opposed to Hitler's ambitions and his attempt to dominate Europe. Pittman refused to comment on Hitler's speech yesterday, saying only that "recent measures taken by European countries have kept the world's disaster far away."</p>
<h3>New Zealand Implements Social Security Law: Couples Over Sixty Receive Weekly Pension</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wellington, 1st] New Zealand implemented the Social Security Act today. Couples over the age of sixty can receive a pension of three pounds a week from the government. The act stipulates free treatment in hospitals, provision of medicines, and confinement, which is expected to be implemented soon. In addition, it also provides benefits to the disabled and the unemployed. New Zealand Prime Minister Savage told reporters that the act is the best of the social security programs around the world.</p>
<h3>Polish Minister of Commerce Roman Visits Italy to Conduct Commercial Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] Polish Minister of Commerce Roman left here today for Rome at the invitation of the Italian government to hold commercial negotiations with Italy.</p>
<h3>The Roman Pope Will Change His Relationship with Germany</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 2nd] The Italian International Echo newspaper published a report yesterday saying that Pope Pius XII will work to improve the relationship between the Vatican and Germany. Pius has been in Germany for many years and knows that most German Catholics pay close attention to the church, so he is expected to improve to meet the needs of German Catholics.</p>
<h3>German Naval Minister Raeder Receives Medal</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Wilhelmshaven, 2nd] Yesterday, Hitler presided over the launching ceremony of Germany's second large warship, "Tirpitz," here. Then, on the "Schloss," he awarded General Tonnde, the Minister of the Navy, a testimonial to commemorate his 45 years of service in the military.</p>
<h3>Goebbels' Speech Attacks Democratic Countries Again</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article entitled "Who Wants War," which said that the war mentality among Western European democratic countries is developing day by day. In recent weeks, London, Paris, and New York have been stirring up war. Goebbels again attacked the Jews, Marxists, and mutual aid members, saying that "they should be responsible for the increase in war feeling, while centralized countries are only defending their own interests. Enlightened people in Britain and France should not deny the centralized states this right, so enlightened people in all countries who love peace can achieve true peace only by meeting the legitimate and important demands of vigorous nations."</p>
<h3>Rumor has it that Italy will convene a seven-nation conference, and Mussolini's speech will once again demand land</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] It is rumored on the fascist side that Italy intends to convene a seven-nation conference in response to the European war crisis. Mussolini has now returned to Rome from southern Italy and is busy reviewing documents on the European situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Mussolini said in a speech in the city of Capua today that Italy has a large population, and the original land is not enough to develop. Other countries must give us land. We demand what is not prohibited by pen and ink. We are backed by a strong will and red blood.</p>
<h3>The Lithuanian Government Protests to Germany for Violating the Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaunas, Lithuania, 2nd] The Lithuanian government protested to Germany through the Lithuanian embassy in Germany, saying that Germany had not implemented the regulations of the Lithuanian-German treaty in the Memel region. It is reported that some Lithuanians in the Memel region have been arrested and have suffered economic oppression and damage.</p>
<h3>The British Chief of Staff Will Leave France and Return Home Today</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd] The British Chief of Staff returned here last night from Strasbourg after inspecting the Maginot Line. The French military and political circles attached great importance to his trip. It is said that he will return to London today.</p>
<h3>The German Ambassador to Argentina Denies Any Intention of Aggression</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2nd] The German ambassador formally denied today that Germany had any intention of aggression against Argentina. The aforementioned claim was made after Foreign Minister Otilis met with the German chargé d'affaires to discuss a certain document. The text of the document was written by Mora, the Nazi leader in Argentina, who has now been arrested. Officials are keeping silent, but it is generally believed that Mora's arrest is related to Nazi activities in Argentina.</p>
<h3>Eden's Speech Agrees with Chamberlain's Declaration and Asks the British People to Unite Further</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in New School that he fully agreed with Chamberlain's declaration on Poland and said that he was convinced that this move would be supported by the people of the whole country. He said, "It is unbearable and indignant that there have been rumors that my remarks have implied any difference of opinion among the responsible authorities regarding foreign policy." Eden finally asked the people of the country to unite even more.</p>
<h3>Slovakia is Forced to Cede Land, the Border Dispute with Hungary is Resolved, and Political Circles are Dissatisfied with Germany's Attitude</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bratislava, 1st] The dispute between Slovakia and Hungary over the border has been declared resolved because the country has agreed to cede land without any accompanying exchange conditions. The ceded land covers about 30 kilometers and has a population of 60,000, all of whom are said to be Ukrainian and Slovak. Political figures here are saying that Germany has signed a protection agreement with this country to guarantee territorial integrity for a period of 25 years. How can it be that today it is forcing this country to cede land to Hungary? What is the effect of the protection agreement? It is also impossible to understand.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister of Poland Departs for England; Expected to Arrive in London This Afternoon; Foreign Minister Meets with German and Polish Ambassadors</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Polish Capital, 2nd] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck (see right image) departed from here at 1:23 PM today for London. Accompanying Beck were Count Potocki, Director of the Western Department of the Polish Foreign Ministry, and two other members. Before his departure, Beck met with British Ambassador Kennard at the train station. He is expected to arrive in London on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>(Haitong Agency, London, 2nd) Yesterday afternoon, Polish Ambassador Raczyński visited the British Foreign Office for an hour-long meeting. The discussion centered on preparing the agenda for Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Diplomatic activities in Rome, Berlin, and Warsaw continued throughout the day. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had a long telephone conversation with Mussolini, who is currently in southern Italy, and then met with the German Ambassador to Italy and the Polish and German Ambassadors. Subsequently, he met with the German and Polish Ambassadors. After leaving the Italian Foreign Ministry, the Polish Ambassador spoke with Polish authorities by telephone. These diplomatic contacts have led to widespread speculation among Roman observers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] The newspaper "L'Oeuvre" reported that Germany is continuously intensifying its military preparations for an invasion of Poland. 65% of the German air force is concentrated near the Polish border, ready to launch a simultaneous invasion of Poland from four different locations. The newspaper concluded that Germany's plans have not alarmed Poland, and Poland is prepared to meet German aggression head-on.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] According to a dispatch from the Katowice News Agency, two officials from the German consulate in that city were seriously injured today after being beaten by Poles. The owner of a German printing company in Jaworzno was also reportedly injured by Poles for speaking German.</p>
<p>Italian Dissatisfaction; Germany Pressures Poland</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st] Diplomatic circles here say that Italian newspapers have recently declared that Italy is quite dissatisfied with Germany's pressure on Poland, resembling its disapproval of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Italy maintains sincere friendship with Hungary and also favors Poland, viewing this as an extension of its friendship with Hungary. At this critical moment, Italy will undoubtedly strive to prevent Germany from invading Poland. At the same time, it will also prevent Poland from establishing permanent ties with Britain. It is unlikely that Mussolini intends to mediate between Germany and Poland, as Hitler will certainly reject it outright.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 31st] Experienced observers here have recently commented on German policy, stating that while Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is about to visit England, Germany's main goal is to put pressure on Poland, satirizing the unreliability of British and French aid. However, Germany may not engage in conflict with Poland at this time due to two reasons: (1) Poland's resistance is quite strong, and (2) Italy is very concerned about Poland, as evidenced by Foreign Minister Ciano's recent visit to Warsaw. If a conflict were to occur between Germany and Poland under these circumstances, the Rome-Berlin Axis would inevitably be weakened. (3) If the German-Polish dispute were to lead to war, it would be even more disadvantageous than a war caused by Italy's colonial demands. Therefore, it can be asserted that Hitler will continue to expand his influence in Eastern Europe by peaceful means and avoid armed conflict at all costs.</p>
<p>French Diplomatic Circles Comment on the Polish Situation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 31st] Diplomatic circles here recently stated that since Germany occupied the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, peace-loving countries have considered forming a coalition to resist. Now that Germany is threatening Poland, this idea has become even more compelling. Germany's goals are: (1) to gain territory from Poland, and (2) to force Poland to remain neutral, allowing Germany to develop in other directions without worry. Since annexing Czechoslovakia and reclaiming the Memel region, Germany has surrounded Poland, which has already felt uneasy. In addition, during recent talks with Germany, Germany made three demands: (1) a certain area in Poland should be returned to Germany, (2) Germany should be allowed to build a highway through the Polish Corridor, and (3) new temporary measures should be established for the Free City of Danzig as a preliminary step to German annexation. Germany's desire to control Poland is evident here. However, Poland has also decided to resist, rejecting the first and second demands. Regarding the third, it only agreed to seriously consider it. It is rumored that Germany has delivered an ultimatum to Poland, but both the German and Polish governments have denied it. However, diplomatic circles here still say that it is true that German troops are on high alert near the Polish border. In light of this, the British government has decided to accept new constraints on Poland and provide guarantees. Poland, in addition to declaring that it would maintain ties with Romania if attacked by Germany, has not accepted any restrictions from Britain, lest Germany uses it as an excuse.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Tabouis Predicts the European Situation; Exposes German Ambitions; Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Should Unite to Resist</h3>
<p>[London, 1st] Mrs. Tabouis recently published an article in "L'Œuvre" predicting the European situation, stating that unless Britain and France form a common front and invite the Soviet Union to join, Hitler's ambitions will have no end. Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia will gradually come under Germany's direct control. As for Belgium and the countries along the northern Polish sea, which have been subjected to constant political pressure since June, they will inevitably be forced to satisfy Germany's great desires. The sudden hardening of the attitude of Western democratic countries has made Germany worry about going to war with them, and Germany's desire for Poland to maintain military neutrality is also very strong. In terms of the eastward advance policy, Poland's position has a very significant impact. Therefore, Germany expects the first guarantee from Poland to be the immediate delivery of the iron ore from Upper Silesia to Germany. The French side has sensed the seriousness of this matter and believes that if anything happens, Germany will occupy the northern Polish territory bordering Slovakia. Germany's offensive towards Romania is also very obvious. Hungarian Prime Minister Horthy has agreed to Germany's request to dissolve the parliament, hold elections, suppress domestic political parties, reorganize the Hungarian army, and allow German troops to pass through Hungary to occupy the Romanian oil fields, using Romania's occupation of the city of Ruthenia as an excuse. Germany has also instructed Italy to attack Albania if anything happens. At this time, Yugoslavia will be controlled by Germany and Italy and forced to submit. The Nordic countries were recently warned that if Germany goes to war with the West, they must supply all minerals and products to the totalitarian countries, otherwise their coasts will be blockaded by Germany. At noon on March 15, Hitler drafted a detailed plan to send ultimatums to the Baltic countries and Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, demanding that they strongly resist the Soviet Union's invasion of the Baltic Sea, otherwise they would be occupied by German troops. On the active side, a "Belgian Affairs Bureau" has been established to prepare for Belgium. If the Soviet military authorities and the British General Staff fail to immediately reach an agreement, Poland's resistance to Germany will be hopeless. The Soviet Union advocates for a</p>
<p>Clear and Firm Agreement, otherwise the Soviet Union will stand aside. The Soviet Union does not feel threatened by Germany, Germany's purpose is economic, but it still wants to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Although Britain and France have the Soviet Union as an ally, they will also feel quite difficult when dealing with Germany and Italy. If the Soviet Union is further sidelined, the European situation will be even more hopeless.</p>
<h3>After the Occupation of Spratly Island, France Protests to Japan; American Newspapers Say Its Importance Will Increase; Mocking Japan's Ambitions</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 2nd] According to newspapers here, the French government has protested to Tokyo about Japan's occupation of Spratly Island, declaring the island to be French territory in principle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] Today's "The Times" editorial said that six years ago, France already felt the importance of Spratly Island to French Indochina, but yesterday the Japanese flag was hoisted on the island without resistance. If the island was already important, its importance has suddenly increased since Japan occupied it. From Spratly to Hong Kong, Manila, Hainan Island, Saigon, Singapore, and Borneo, it only takes a few hours by plane, so if disputes occur in Europe in the future, Japan may take action in various places.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] The "New York Times" recently published an editorial on Japan's annexation of the Spratly Islands, titled "Japan's Old Habits Return," which stated that this group of islands has been incorporated into France. While Japan is committed to issues vital to its survival, it has brushed aside the Spratly Islands, which are extremely important to that country. A few months ago, it forcibly seized Hainan Island in China, and now it has raised its flag on a group of islands 700 miles south of that island. This is another example of Japan's usual tactics.</p>
<h3>The Spanish Civil War Completely Ends; The United States Decides to Recognize Franco; Cancels the Order Prohibiting the Shipment of Arms to Spain</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Madrid, 2nd] The Franco government issued a final military communiqué, stating that the Spanish Civil War has completely ended, that the Franco army has achieved its final goal, and that the Red Army has been completely disarmed.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Washington, 2nd] Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull announced that the United States had decided to recognize the Franco government in Burgos.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The American government has decided to legally recognize Franco as the leader of Spain. The government has cancelled its order prohibiting the export of weapons to Spain.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the United States has now recognized the Franco government of Spain. This decision is unconditional. The U.S. government has telegraphed the Franco government in Burgos, notifying them that the United States will restore normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. As for who the United States will send as ambassador to Spain, it has not yet been decided. At the same time, the U.S. President also signed a declaration in Warm Springs, cancelling the order prohibiting the shipment of weapons to Spain, and said that "there is no longer a civil war in Spain."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] U.S. Secretary of State Hull formally announced today when meeting with reporters that the United States has recognized the Spanish Nationalist government. According to news, the Nationalist government recognized by the United States does not violate its principle of denying aggressors. The United States denies "Manchukuo" and also denies Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and Germany's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia, but recognizes the Franco government because the actions of German and Italian troops in Spain have not been officially recognized.</p>
<h3>The Czech Republic's Debt to the British; England is Seriously Dealing With It</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British government is seriously dealing with the issue of Czechoslovakia's debt to the British people. The Bank of England, on behalf of the Treasury, is currently seeking detailed reports on bonds, commercial stocks, bank deposits, and all other debts invested in the Czech government or companies, except for commercial debts and debts in the Sudeten region.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Embarrassed Actions of the Aggression Front</h3>
<p>Since the painful experience of the fall of Czechoslovakia proved the mistake of the appeasement diplomacy of Britain and France, the prestige of the Soviet Union has increased in the world, and the democratic peace front has begun to embark on the road of consolidation and expansion. Therefore, the actions of the fascist aggressor group of Germany, Italy, and Japan have become embarrassed. On the one hand, as the power of aggression develops, the internal contradictions of the aggressive groups become more acute. On the other hand, due to the severity of the domestic and foreign crises of various countries, they have to strengthen the "axis" to support it. Thus, the newspapers in the past few days have found many contradictory and ridiculous news about the aggressor countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, observing the recent expansion of the anti-Soviet and especially anti-British movements on the Japanese side, Germany has also begun large-scale anti-British activities, such as Hitler's April 1 speech publicly tearing up the Anglo-German naval agreement and scolding Britain. These actions by Japan and Germany are clearly a reaction to Britain's recent closeness to the Soviet Union and the stronger attitudes of Britain and France. It can be said that the aggression front has been passively forced back for the first time.</p>
<p>However, we must recognize that, as far as the current situation is concerned, the fascist aggression front will not only not disintegrate, but will also be strengthened. Mussolini's speech in late March particularly emphasized adherence to the German-Italian axis, and Hitler's speech on April 1 further stated that "the German-Italian axis will continue in all situations and times." The Japan-Germany commercial agreement is indeed in progress, and Germany is once again brewing a plot to induce China to surrender. Therefore, we must say that it is a mistake to emphasize the division of the aggression front today. If we weaken our vigilance against the aggressors as a result, and if we harbor any illusions about a certain country in the aggression front, then it must be considered a crime.</p>

<h3>Agreement Between British and Australian Governments; Australia Supplies Military Aircraft to Hong Kong; Australian Aircraft Factory Can Manufacture 60 Aircraft Per Month, Reaching Over 200 During Wartime; Hong Kong Army Authorities Will Continue to Recruit Chinese Engineers</h3>
<p>The British government, in view of the approaching world war, is preparing its army with utmost urgency, allowing no slack. At the same time, it is strengthening the defenses of the colonies as actively as the island of Britain. According to Western reports from Hong Kong, the British government has reached an agreement with the Australian government to build several aircraft manufacturing plants of considerable scale in Australia to supply military aircraft to British Aden, Ceylon, India, Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, Fiji, New Zealand and Australian bases. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturing New Aircraft to Supply to British Territories</p>
<p>According to the plan, the Australian aircraft factory will produce 60 aircraft per month in peacetime, expanding its production to 200 to 210 aircraft during wartime. The type of aircraft has been agreed upon by the British and Australian governments, adopting the latest British models. In fact, these latest military aircraft are still being rushed by British aircraft factories and have not yet been delivered to the Air Force Department. These military aircraft are twin-engined, with the highest connection rate and can travel long distances, making them most suitable for defending Australia. Each aircraft is worth approximately 30,000 pounds. Based on this calculation, Australian aircraft production will be worth 20 million pounds in peacetime and can increase to 60 to 70 million pounds during wartime. The Australian government estimates that it can add 40 aircraft each year, costing approximately 1.2 million pounds. The British government hopes that the plan can start as soon as possible, and the British Air Force has recently sent many air force experts to inspect and plan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Army Authorities Continue to Recruit Chinese Engineers</p>
<p>In addition, the Hong Kong military authorities have spared no effort in constructing Hong Kong's defenses in recent years. Due to the vastness of the construction, the existing British troops are not enough to be deployed. Therefore, the army authorities have recruited Chinese engineers. Up to now, the seventh batch has been recruited, with the number of people reaching nearly 300. According to investigations by reporters, the Hong Kong Army Headquarters needs to use a large number of engineers to build fortifications, and now it wants to recruit again. It is expected that a formal notice will be issued soon. Chinese engineers are responsible for electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering, with electrical and mechanical being the most important. The initial salary for enlisted engineers is 75 cents per day, and they are promoted in five levels, depending on their intelligence or skills. Those who have studied engineering are relatively easy to be promoted. At the fifth level, the daily salary is approximately two dollars. In addition to the salary, a certain amount of pounds will be issued annually for uniform fees. Last year, the army authorities recruited Chinese to join the heavy artillery unit for training, which has been going on for several months. It is heard that the results are not very good, and the authorities currently have no intention of continuing to recruit. However, the current period is a trial period. If it is believed that the personnel are not sufficient for deployment in the future, another recruitment will be held, which is also unpredictable. In addition, a part of the Chinese engineers who have been trained will be assigned to various forts to be in charge of searchlights and anti-aircraft lights, and the results are quite good.</p>
<h3>× Country Summer Fabrics are Massively Transported to Hong Kong; The Amount Currently Arriving in Hong Kong Has Reached Tens of Thousands of Dollars; Disguised as Domestic Products and Other Trademarks for Sale</h3>
<p>Recently, the quantity of various goods produced in × country and transported to Hong Kong for sale has increased again. According to reliable sources, in the past one or two months, another large batch of textiles has arrived in Hong Kong, with a value of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In addition to a portion of these × country textiles being rayon, ready to be transshipped to various occupied areas in Guangdong Province, a portion is counterfeit products from other countries, taking advantage of the summer fabric market in Hong Kong for</p>
<p>Mass Sales in Hong Kong, and Some are even disguised as Chinese-made fabrics.</p>
<p>In recent months, many × goods falsely claiming to be Chinese products have been discovered in Hong Kong, transported from occupied areas such as Shanghai, and sold in Hong Kong or transshipped to various parts of the country. Therefore, in recent months, this kind of counterfeit × goods has been sold smoothly in the city. This kind of counterfeit domestic goods is mostly textile textiles. Since our coastal ports have been successively occupied, the domestic handicraft textile industry has become extremely developed. Because the raw materials produced in Europe and the United States are expensive, × has taken advantage of this weakness to</p>
<p>Disguise × goods as domestic products, trademarks, and transport them to the mainland for sale. Mainland merchants take advantage of their low prices to purchase in large quantities. ×</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Jiangmen and Chongqing; Yesterday's Hong Kong-Macau Vessels Carried 3,000 Refugees; Traffic Between Jiangmen and Macau Remains Severed; Hong Kong Merchants Temporarily Suspend Transporting Goods to the Mainland</h3>
<p>After the fall of Jiangmen, many Siyi refugees fled to Hong Kong and Macau to avoid innocent sacrifices. The vessels on the Hong Kong-Macau transportation line carried approximately 3,000 refugees yesterday, with very little cargo. According to a refugee who recently escaped from Jiangmen, the traffic between Jiangmen and Macau remains severed. Refugees from Lianhetang outside Jiangmen are taking Xiaohang Road to Shiqi to take the Qiguan car to Macau. Currently, the Qiguan Company is overwhelmed because the demand for vehicles exceeds the supply. Therefore, the black cars from Qi to Macau have raised their prices, charging 30 yuan per person for the fare. Rickshaws also charge 20 yuan, and those riding on the back of bicycles also charge 10 yuan, and there are still many people walking along the way. In addition, the vessels from Hong Kong merchants to Macau in the past two days have transported very few goods to the mainland, because the Jiangmen war has affected the merchants, and all merchants have stopped shipping goods for the time being. Even daily necessities and textiles have been temporarily suspended, fearing that they will be detained by × after being transported in.</p>

<h3>Not Forgetting Patriotism and Love for the Homeland in Distant Lands; Cuban Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Care About the National Crisis; The Disaster Relief Branch Sent Kwong Sau-wok Back Home with Funds; Investigating the Situation of Refugees and Conducting Relief Work</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of our country's war of resistance, the Cuban Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Disaster Relief Branch has been promoting donations and bond purchases among local overseas Chinese, sparing no effort, and the results have been extremely satisfactory. It has donated approximately 100,000 Hong Kong dollars to the National Government and more than 2 million yuan in national salvation bonds. The association has recently become increasingly concerned about the protection and relief of the homeland due to the increasingly tense war in South China. Therefore, last month, it specially sent representative Kwong Sau-wok back to China to investigate the recent situation of the county, and brought with him a donation of 11,800 Hong Kong dollars. Half of these funds were allocated by the association to the Hong Kong Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Association to provide relief to refugees, and the other half was entrusted to Guo Quan, Chairman of the Hong Kong Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Association, to handle, and handed over to Zhang Huichang, the county magistrate of the county, to purchase military equipment, strengthen forces, and protect the county.</p>

<h3>Police Detectives Departed in the Rain Yesterday to Search Various Villages in the New Territories; Determined to Strengthen Police Security in the New Territories to Advance the Pursuit and Arrest of Criminals; Link Up with New Territories Gentry and Residents to Eradicate Banditry</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Police authorities, in view of the recent rampant banditry on the Peninsula, with robbery cases occurring frequently almost every day, and the previously tranquil villages of the New Territories also becoming a world of bandits, with frequent reports of farmers being robbed and killed, have planned to strengthen the police detective forces in various districts such as Yaumatei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui, and Kowloon Tong Police Stations, to intensify vigilance and patrol the streets, and have strictly ordered detectives to conscientiously investigate opium dens, gambling houses, and the movements of residents in general buildings, residential areas, and boats on the sea. As for the New Territories side:</p>
<p>New Territories Aspect: The police authorities are also paying close attention. The situation in the New Territories is considered to be more complicated than that of Hong Kong Island because the land is vast, and villages are scattered everywhere. In addition to the original local farmers residing there, many people from the Mainland seeking refuge in Hong Kong have recently rented houses there. Good and bad people are mixed together, and it is easier to hide weapons in villages and mountain huts than in any other area. If not thoroughly and secretly investigated, it would be difficult to detect such activities. Therefore, to eradicate banditry in Hong Kong, the defense of the New Territories and the</p>
<p>Measures for Arresting Criminals cannot be neglected. Under the plan to strengthen the public security forces on the Peninsula, the police authorities have decided to increase the number of Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers and detectives in various districts of the New Territories in a short period. At the same time, they will maintain close contact with local gentry and villagers to assist each other and promote the efficiency of arrests. When necessary, they will take further steps to organize a community defense system based on the Mainland's "Baojia" system to prevent criminals from hiding. Yesterday afternoon, amid pouring rain, more than ten Chinese and Western police detectives from the Peninsula, led by Chinese Detective Chief Shi Dui and British Detective Assistant Superintendent, departed in several vehicles to the New Territories.</p>
<p>Searching Villages in many places, according to reports, prior intelligence suggested that undesirable elements were hiding in certain villages in the New Territories, which were related to the continuous occurrence of robberies in the New Territories. Detective Chief Shi immediately reported the situation to his superiors, who dispatched a team to search the area. They returned to Hong Kong at around 8 p.m. that night. However, after searching many places, they did not find any suspects or contraband. Nevertheless, the police authorities are determined to maintain law and order in the New Territories and will begin implementing various actions based on the newly decided steps, hoping to achieve rapid results.</p>
<h3>People's Travels</h3>

<h3>Overseas × Ships Run Amok Again; 16 of Our Fishing Boats Suffer; After Extensive Search and Robbery, They Seize All the Boats; Another Coal Boat is Burned, and Many Crew Members are Missing</h3>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, our coastal fishing boats have repeatedly suffered from the ravages of × ships. Yesterday, March 29, seventeen Yu boats and cargo boats in the waters outside Hong Kong, the North and South Ports, and Ma Yükou, were seized by ×. One of them was burned en route, which was extremely tragic. According to fishermen who narrowly escaped and arrived in Hong Kong, they were fishing in groups on the morning of the 29th of last month, scattering nets in the Chinese territories of Changbo opposite the South Port and Ma Yü, the North Port. Suddenly, a × destroyer, a armed fishing boat, and three speedboats came head-on. They were unable to escape and were captured. A total of three fishing boats were captured. At the same time, a armed submarine of the × Navy sailed from behind South Ao Mountain in the North Port sea area. Seven fishing boats fishing there were also captured. After the × ships seized the boats, they converged at the foot of South Ao Mountain, a total of ten ships, arranged in a row. At about 1 p.m. that afternoon, four more fishing boats and one large sailboat were sailing in the waters outside Ma Yükou and South Port. The × ships spotted them and dispatched three merchant ships to seize them. At the same time, two coal boats anchored near Da Sui were also seized by ×. On the way, × actually set one of them on fire. Of the more than ten crew members, only five managed to escape. The fate of the others is unknown. According to statistics, a total of sixteen fishing boats and cargo boats were seized, and one coal boat was burned.</p>

<h3>Connecting Friendship, Promoting Proper Entertainment: A Record of the Amateur Social Club</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>The Amateur Social Club Held an Enlarged Welcome Meeting for New Members Yesterday</p>
<p>Vitality must be developed; what about spare time? Many people feel that they should not indulge in cards, dancing, going to tea houses, and watching movies—poisonous movies. They will not find true happiness in these aspects. Therefore, they stay away from the "licentious and shameless" side and move towards the "serious and lively" side.</p>
<p>Every time the night falls, and the "neon" lights temptingly illuminate the night city, you can see people in Chinese clothes, in suits, men and women, leaving the office one by one, eating their fill, and gathering one after another at the premises at 23 Connaught Road. Although climbing the four-story building without an elevator is strenuous, their excited steps make them take two steps at a time. This is the address of the Hong Kong Amateur Social Club. The sea breeze blows in gusts, looking out at the clouds, they have to throw themselves into the embrace of nature, even though this is "black smoke"-filled Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Reading newspapers, playing ping pong, learning Mandarin, learning Cantonese, improving singing, acting in plays, and there are also reading groups, current affairs forums... Everything that can allow vitality to develop in beneficial ways is available. You can play whatever you like. There is laughter and talk. It is both serious and lively. This is truly a good place for leisure. When the club was officially established at the Confucius Hall, which was on January 8 this year, there were only more than 180 members. As a result of recent recruitment, there are now more than 480 new members. Yesterday, the club held an enlarged social gathering to welcome new members at the Confucius Hall. The grand occasion was even more enthusiastic, and the progress in all aspects was even more impressive and inspiring.</p>
<p>Although the weather was gloomy, with densely overcast skies, when it came to the three-and-a-half sentence skit, the sky was clear and the sun was shining. The Confucius Hall was immediately filled with new and old members of the club, as well as family members and guests, reaching a considerable number of seven or eight hundred people.</p>
<p>The laughter of adults and the shouts of children, calling to each other, filled the entire venue with a harmonious and joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Yao Jianhou delivered the opening speech. In addition to enthusiastically stating the recent progress of the club's affairs, he particularly pointed out the three points that they should do: (1) To increase knowledge in collective life, (2) To replace improper entertainment with proper entertainment; (3); To contribute all our strength to the motherland and strive for the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The words were concise and moving. Then came the report of the club's affairs, "The first thing we have done in the past is to establish a library; the second is to respond to various patriotic movements; the third is to establish a theater troupe and a singing team; the fourth is to publish three periodicals on academic aspects, organize reading groups, current affairs forums, lectures, Mandarin classes, Cantonese classes... etc. Fifth, in terms of social events, there are weekly trips, picnics... etc. Sixth, in terms of services for members, we have contacted many shops, companies, bookstores, and newspapers to offer preferential treatment to members."</p>
<p>The speech was given by Mr. Guo Butao, the editor of this newspaper, by prior appointment. He earnestly spoke about the importance of lifelong learning in amateur social groups. He also cited his own experience in the newspaper industry as an example. The more he spoke, the more vigorous he became, talking non-stop for more than an hour.</p>
<p>The "National Covenant" was sworn in a formal ceremony. Everyone stood reverently to take the oath. Mr. Wang Junheng sincerely encouraged everyone to strictly abide by the oath, which is the meaning of the oath. The victory of the Anti-Japanese War also depends on the revitalization of all our people. After Fang Yuansheng awarded prizes to the five members with the best performance in recruiting members, the entertainment began.</p>
<p>Singing, harmonica, dancing... etc. In addition to the club's performances, there were also groups such as the China Amateur School Choir, the Commercial Press Choir, and the Yau Chung Kindergarten participating. The most exciting program was the ventriloquism and dialect performance by Mr. Tu Yunfu, a member of the club. The sounds of various birds and animals, as well as dozens of dialects and tunes from Peiping to Central and Southern China, were vividly and humorously presented, causing everyone to laugh and applaud.</p>
<p>Finally, the club's theater troupe performed the anti-feudal drama "Other Bitter Women," which was quite moving. There was also an anti-× drama "Black Shadow," but because the light was dim, it was announced that it would be seen next time.</p>

<h3>A Casual Talk about Flower Cloth Street</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's "Flower Cloth Street" is just like Guangzhou's "Yang Lane." They are both big markets for woolen fabrics and flower cloths. To put it humorously, they can be said to be sisters. However, today's Yang Lane in Guangzhou, one does not know to what extent it has been ravaged and trampled by the ferocious wolf's × people. If Yang Lane, Guangzhou, and even every inch of our lost territory, have not been restored to its original beauty and prosperity, and if our "national hatred" has not been eliminated, then our responsibility cannot be relaxed for a moment, but must be intensified!</p>
<p>"Flower Cloth Street" is located in the Central District, with its two ends connecting the middle part of Queen's Road and Des Voeux Road, only one hundred and several tens of yards away from the Central Market, known as the only one in the Far East. Its original name was Shui On Street. Precisely because the poetic "nickname" was established, the real name gradually became blurred under the influence of metabolism, and almost made people forget it.</p>
<p>"Flower Cloth Street" is such an ordinary market that there is originally nothing worth recording, and people who live in Hong Kong can generally know its outline. However, the enlightenment of facts is that we can always find extraordinary stories in the ordinary. This story is what I want to introduce to the readers.</p>
<p>There are a total of 57 fabric shops and "stalls" on "Flower Cloth Street," but only 21 of them have the "Certificate of Eradicating Inferior Goods" issued by the Fabric Merchant Association hanging in their shops. So, does that mean that those without this certificate are all places selling inferior goods? That was what I was thinking at the time. Later, after some investigation, I realized that those without the certificate simply had not joined the Fabric Merchant Association as members. However, local newspapers in Hong Kong often have records of the surge in the sale of × goods in Hong Kong. Why has the market for × goods changed from dead to booming again? If we explore the root, we will not find it difficult to get an answer.</p>
<p>Many friends who come to Hong Kong from the Mainland want to buy some things to take back with them, because in their eyes, everything here is duty-free and cheap. They only hate that they do not have so much money in their pockets, otherwise they would buy the entire Hong Kong market clean." So flower cloth is also one of the markets that they want to buy.</p>
<p>As soon as you walk into "Flower Cloth Street," you will feel the surging crowds and the mixed sounds, constantly piercing your eyes and ears, "Buy it... it's cheap... one penny and six yards, big... aunt." The glib shop assistants cast greedy eyes, stretched out their necks, and raised their voices, uttering those frivolous and slippery sounds to every female guest. The shop assistants here do not seem to welcome single men or female customers accompanied by men. The most welcomed are still groups of three or five "misses." Although they do not necessarily patronize when they go to the shop, the shop assistants tirelessly pile the fabrics they consider to be "beautiful" on top of the goods. If you are a single man, go there and casually ask the price, and there is no "transaction," at the very least, they will secretly scold you "dou ni gui" ("dou ni gui" means no money in the bag), and may even curse you!</p>
<p>I do not intend to slander them, but the fact is still the fact, and I cannot hide it. But does that mean that all the shop assistants there are like that? Not necessarily. In a town of ten houses, there must be honest people. There are also many who can truly serve customers, work diligently, and keep their eyes on the task at hand. However, we must understand the principle of "a bad apple spoils the whole bunch." Therefore, I hope that they can encourage each other to carry out a cleaning movement, reward the outstanding ones, correct the corrupted ones, and even impose appropriate and due punishments, to maintain commercial ethics. Then, they can still be considered outstanding people who know the times, otherwise, their future will only be gradually heading towards the path of decline and destruction! (New)</p>

<h3>Situation in Northern Guangdong on the Eve of the Storm: Front Lines Have Had Daily Skirmishes; Our Army Is Steadily Advancing and Seizing Opportunities to Attack</h3>
<p>(Northern Guangdong Express News) In recent weeks, the situation on the front lines of Northern Guangdong has seen our × and the × still facing each other in their original positions. Although the × in Conghua and Huaxian are constantly violating our alert territories, they are only probing and do not have any major actions. Our Northern Route Counter-Offensive Military has been actively deploying and reorganizing in recent days and will soon be unveiled.</p>
<p>Our Army Monitors the × in Conghua</p>
<p>The × troops coming to Northern Guangdong, seeing that our large army on the northern route is moving south in a steady stream and that a counter-offensive is about to begin, have urgently increased troop deployments to Huaxian to resist stubbornly, attempting to act foolishly. Therefore, in the past ten days, the × troops on the front lines have frequently encroached on our positions. According to reports, the military command has telegraphed orders to our troops stationed in various parts of Northern Guangdong to advance gradually, closely monitor the ×, advance steadily, and seize opportunities to attack. Since our army closely monitors the × troops entrenched in Conghua and Huaxian, the × troops are afraid of our heavy blows and have been confined to a corner, daring not to offend us. Once the troops from each unit have reached their respective goals, they will launch a large-scale counter-offensive against the × in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Are Active on the Guangzhou-Huaxian Line</p>
<p>The × troops entrenched in Huaxian, Xinjie, Hengtan, Longkou, and other places have been causing trouble in the surrounding areas in recent days. Therefore, the local people have joined the guerrillas to kill ×. Villagers in Xinjie, Shizi Ridge, Zhanghua, and Changgang have organized commando teams. Therefore, the guerrillas are very active. On the morning of March 27, more than 100 × infantry and cavalry troops moved from Xinjie back to Changgang near the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway for a rotation of defenses. Our guerrilla team from a certain unit detected this and ambushed them at a narrow, strategically important location near Changgang. The × troops were caught off guard and were continuously shot and killed by our troops. The × troops then fired fiercely at our troops with artillery fire. Our team used the terrain to fight back and fought fiercely for a long time. The × troops could not withstand the attack and fled. In this battle, we seized several guns and ammunition, two × flags, and many documents. A field diary found on the body of Kishiyama, a × soldier who was killed, has been handed over to a certain local unit for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Military Dignitaries Complete Patrol of Defenses</p>
<p>According to military news, Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, seeing that the military operations to counter-attack Guangzhou are about to begin, has organized a tour of the defense lines to boost morale. He recently organized an inspection tour of the defense lines. Now that the defense of the northern route is important, he specially dispatched a certain military dignitary to patrol the front lines of the northern Guangdong route. It has been learned that the officer has arrived in a certain area of Guangdong and has separately met with the commanders of the defending armies to inquire about everything and give instructions on combat tactics. It is reported that the task has now been completed. It will return to Shaoguan during the day to report to Commander Zhang Fakui. Furthermore, it has been learned that since the tour of the defense lines by the dignitary, the morale of the armies on the front lines has been boosted, and the strength of the defenses has become more consolidated.</p>
<h3>Our Defenses in Xinhui Are Consolidated; Situation in Zhongshan Is Calm; × Ships Harass Chixi, Taishan; × Planes Bomb Xinhui and Kaiping Extensively</h3>
<p>(Macau Express News) Since the sudden capture of Ronggui by the × troops on the 27th, Jiangmen and Shiqi were simultaneously in a state of emergency. That night, the × troops dispatched naval, land, and air forces to attack Jiangmen in three routes. Our team joined forces with the regular army to intercept and engage the enemy. After nine days of bloody battles, the × troops suffered more than a thousand casualties. Later, because the × troops' artillery fire was too fierce, our fortifications were completely destroyed, and we had extracted a considerable price from the × troops, we withdrew from Jiangmen and concentrated near the county seat to continue the war. A fierce battle took place on one evening in the suburbs of the county seat, annihilating many × troops. The × troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Jiangmen. We seized the opportunity to counter-attack Jiangmen and are still engaged in a mixed battle.</p>
<p>The Defenses of Xinhui Are Consolidated</p>
<p>After the fierce battle in Jiangmen, our army shifted its positions and advanced to Xinhui County. The front lines were placed in the Fengshan mountains to block the × troops' advance. When Changjiangdou fell, our army in Tangxia was still fighting with the × troops. Later, with the fall of Jiangmen, the Tangxia line became prominent and has retreated towards Shaping. At present, we have laid out a horizontal and vertical battle formation between Shaping and Xinhui County. The local teams of Heshan and Xinhui counties are jointly holding the line. The regular army units of Chen Zhangyang He and others have also joined forces with the local teams to defend together. There is no concern for the defense of the county seat.</p>
<p>× Ships Harass Chixi, Taishan</p>
<p>When Jiangmen was in an emergency, many × ships sailed to the waters of Chixi, Taishan and constantly fired artillery shells at our coastal villages. There was also a × aircraft carrier in the Huanghai area, flying to the Baisha and Yueshan areas of Taishan to carry out atrocities. The city of Baisha was hit by several bombs, resulting in more than 100 casualties.</p>
<p>Situation in Zhongshan Is Calm</p>
<p>Currently, our guerrilla forces in the county are extremely active and are working with the regular army to surround the × troops attacking Huicheng. In order to save the situation, the × troops dispatched multiple planes to bomb Xinhui and Kaiping extensively. The people in Kaiping have been evacuating one after another, and few people remain. Because telegraphs and telephones are not working, the details are unknown. The × troops did not expect such fierce resistance when they attacked Jiangmen this time, resulting in heavy casualties. It is expected that they will not have the strength to penetrate deeply. Therefore, the situation in Zhongshan has become slightly calmer in recent days.</p>
<h3>Dumping of × Goods: Large Quantities of Guangdong × Goods Disguised and Mixed for Sale</h3>
<p>[Macau Express News] Since the × army occupied Guangzhou, their accompanying merchant group has been vigorously seeking to develop commerce in Guangdong and implement their economic aggression. They have recently been dumping goods stored in Huangpu warehouses at low prices. The largest items include kerosene, matches, and raw oil. Furthermore, in the old Nanguo Promotion Center opposite Sincere Department Store on Changdi, now renamed the Military Economic Class Promotion Center, cosmetics, canned goods, etc., are displayed, with young boys employed to sell them. Additionally, the Fuda Company is recruiting agents for wholesale distribution. It is rumored that each case of kerosene is sold for only six military notes, which is one-third cheaper than foreign Eagle brand. Each can of raw oil is sixteen yuan, and each case of matches (120 packets) is sold for ten yuan. Therefore, a group of traitors, seeking profit, are disguising the goods and selling them inland. In recent days, kerosene and raw oil along the West River have been very cheap. Ignorant villagers, attracted by the low price, are vying to buy and use them.

<p>[Huiyang Express News] Regarding the military affairs of the Eastern Route Counter-offensive, General Commander Wu Qiqing, in addition to ordering his troops to aggressively advance towards the × army strongholds in Dongguan and Zengcheng counties, is striving to enrich all deployments to obtain the most favorable combat results and ensure victory. The vanguard troops have already made contact with the × army and gained a favorable position. The latest military situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Chi and Zhai Inspect Hui and Dong Regions</p>
<p>Wu Qiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Army Group and Commander of the Eastern Route, in order to strengthen the defense capabilities on both sides of the Dong River and increase the chances of annihilating the × army, has appointed Chi Zhongkuan as the Commander of the South Bank of the Dong River and Zhai Rongji as the Deputy Commander, responsible for the operations of the local forces in Dongguan, Bao'an, Huizhou, and Boluo counties. Chi and Zhai, after receiving their orders, have officially taken office. Commander Chi arrived in Huizhou yesterday, the 31st, summoned the guerrilla commanders of the Third District, Luo Fengxiang, Liang Zhu, and Bu Zhiyang, Lin Junsheng, and other branch and team leaders, gave instructions on the offensive plan, consulted on all matters, and inspected the various local forces. Deputy Commander Zhai Rongji has also arrived in Dongguan and met with the guerrilla commanders of the Fourth District, Wang Ruozhou, Zhang Wodong, Yuan Huazhao, Luo Kun, etc., to make detailed plans for attacking Shilong, Dongguan City, and Taiping. On the 31st and the 1st, he inspected the front lines of the Huizhou-Dongguan Highway and the Kowloon Railway.</p>
<p>Third and Fourth Districts Closely Coordinate</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noted that after attending the provincial guerrilla conference and returning to their defense areas, the guerrilla commanders of the Third District, Luo Fengxiang, and the Fourth District, Wang Ruozhou, are earnestly following the resolutions of the conference and the various plans instructed by the highest military commanders, prioritizing them according to urgency and implementing them step by step. Considering that the strength of the various local forces in the past did not meet the expected standards, and coordination was somewhat disorganized, which greatly affected combat effectiveness, in addition to making major adjustments, they are now jointly discussing a coordination plan for the local forces of the two districts. They have decided to establish a clear defense line for the subordinate regiments and teams, establish a close communication organization, improve the intelligence network, and mutually dispatch officers, so that they can consult on all matters nearby, coordinate closely, and jointly defend, thereby enhancing combat capabilities.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Organization Emerges in Zengcheng: Liu ×× Dresses Up as an Official</h3>
<p>(Huiyang Express News) The invading × army, adhering to its consistent policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese," is actively establishing puppet regimes. Dongguan, Panyu, Nanhai, and Shunde counties have already been established. Those that have not yet been organized are in active preparation. It is now found that Zengcheng County, under the protection of the × army, also produced a pseudo-maintenance association on the 29th, with ×× as the pseudo-maintenance association chairman. After the traitor Liu dressed up as an official, he flattered the × army in a servile manner. In recent days, he has dispatched henchmen to various villages to search for dozens of young women, detain them and return them to the county town as tributes to the × army for ravaging.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou × Army Fears Our Guerrilla Team's Infiltration: × Headquarters Relocated to Suburbs. City Only Has Consumption, No Production. × Army's Air Defense Capabilities Extremely Weak.</h3>
<p>(Shamian Correspondence) The security situation in Guangzhou has been deteriorating day by day. This is partly due to the poor discipline of the × army, and the pseudo-self-defense teams are just a disguised form of bandits. Moreover, a large number of local ruffians are risking danger due to the pressure of life. Therefore, daytime robbery has become a routine occurrence. Although the × people have been trying to attract people from various villages and provinces back to the city in hopes of revitalizing Guangzhou, people are already terrified. As of now, according to investigations by foreign reporters, the city's population still cannot exceed approximately 120,000 and is tending to decrease. The issue of prosperity is unsustainable because all the shops resuming business in the city are consumer-oriented, and there is not a single production factory. Those with slightly more capital are hesitant to move forward. Without production, how can there be prosperity? This is clear evidence of the reality.</p>
<p>× Army Agencies Relocated for Investigation</p>
<p>Since the Zhengjin Bank was attacked by our guerrilla team and further warned by the Iron Blood National Salvation Letter, the × army knows that there are many of our people's armed forces in the city. Fearing attacks, the Southern Branch Dispatch Army Headquarters of the × army, originally stationed in the New Asia Hotel at Xihaokou, was urgently relocated to the suburbs. The locations of the × army agencies have also changed. Investigations are as follows: The Expeditionary Army Headquarters has moved to Zhixin School near Huanghuagang. The Military Police Headquarters is in the former Japanese Police Bureau. The Garrison Headquarters is in the old Security Corps Headquarters opposite the Police Bureau. The Army Special Service Agency is in the Finance Department. The Marine Special Service Agency is in the old Municipal Zhongshan Library on Wende Road. All military supplies, grain, rice, and horses are in the East Parade Ground.</p>
<p>Weak Air Defense, Few Weapons</p>
<p>× has been vigorously constructing defensive works in the suburbs of Guangzhou. There has been fortification near Baiyun Mountain, behind Yuexiu Mountain, and along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway and the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway. However, air defense capabilities are extremely weak. The × anti-aircraft unit, originally located in the Wujia Ancestral Hall in Henan, has now moved to a residential area in Dongsha in the suburbs. The words "Island Artillery Unit Headquarters" are still written in front of Wujia Ancestral Hall as a disguise. Continued investigations have revealed that the high-level units stationed in the Dongsha residential area to protect the command of Zhixin School have only two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns. Other agencies do not have such weapons. On the night of July 30th, gunshots were heard in Huanghuagang, reportedly due to our guerrilla team's night attack on the × anti-aircraft gun positions, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Special Maritime News</h3>
<p>The D'Artagnan of the French Far East Steamship Company, which arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai earlier, was found to have one of its propeller blades suddenly submerged in the sea about 200 miles from Hong Kong. Therefore, after the ship arrived in Hong Kong, it entered the Taikoo Dockyard for inspection and to refit the original engine before sailing to Haiphong. It is estimated that this project has delayed the voyage by ten days.</p>
<p>The Jinshan of the Hong Kong, Canton &amp; Macao Steamboat Co., Ltd., is currently unable to return to Hong Kong due to the steel cable of the submarine telegraph touching the engine in Macau. A tugboat has been dispatched from the Kowloon Dockyard to tow it back to the dock for repairs. It is reported that this repair project will take about ten days, and the ship will be able to sail between Hong Kong and Macau on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>From Huiyang to Chao'an</h3>
<p>— Lin Guangjin</p>
<p>1. Walking on the Eastern River Where the Crisis Has Not Passed</p>
<p>I was originally a staff member in the political department of the × guerrilla area. Because the political department received orders from above to temporarily cease activities from the end of January, I ended my work in the guerrilla team, forcing me to leave Si Ling and seek other work.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 9th, braving the piercing north wind, I hired a small boat and set off upstream along the East River. Against the current and the wind, the boat moved like an ant. Crouched in the cabin, after a long two days, I finally arrived at the county town of Xun Yuan. After walking for another three days along the rugged mountain paths, I finally reached the old residence upstream of the East River.</p>
<p>During this journey, I saw many places violated by the × people, sadly and painfully sighing there unattended, with spots of blood still remaining, fully exposing the ferocity and brutality of the × people. I also heard many weak and old people in the occupied areas, survivors of the war, groaning and weeping, having suffered the destruction and trampling of the violent × people, and then subjected to the exploitation of newly emerging exorbitant taxes and the wanton looting of conscienceless local bandits, about to be displaced and unable to survive. At the same time, I also saw many civil movement workers running and shouting all day long, but unable to obtain positive political leadership and practical assistance from the local government, so that work could not continue to be carried out, making them feel that the blood and sweat they shed were falling into the sand, unable to converge into the torrent of resistance, which was extremely depressing. Moreover, I also knew that when Huiyang fell before, there were a few government officials who had already withdrawn from Huizhou City. It was not that they had nothing to eat or wear, but they actually ran to the city to be "good citizens" before the × people had withdrawn from Huiyang, willing to be slaves of the × people, willing to be slaves of a fallen country. This kind of public enemy, despised by everyone, should be eradicated. However, after Huiyang was recovered, they were not only not subject to government sanctions, but some even climbed up the social ladder!</p>
<p>All of this, anyone who has been to the East River can see and hear. The survival of these phenomena fully reflects that the crisis on the East River has not passed.</p>
<p>Originally, the reason why the × people withdrew from Huibo this time was because of their insufficient troop strength, and they felt threatened by our guerrillas, self-defense teams, and the national army all over the mountains and plains. Strategically, they had to retreat temporarily. This was due to the × people's inability to do so, and not out of willingness. The kind of pouncing posture of the × soldiers in the Zengcheng Shilong area towards the East River recently, on the one hand, was a chaotic move to divert attention in response to the battles on various fronts, and on the other hand, it was to defend against our army's encirclement, and to carry out a defensive attack. However, this cannot be said that the × people have completely abandoned their conspiracy to spy on the East River. According to reports, the × people have recently sent many traitors to the area near the East River to carry out political activities, which proves that the × people's ambition has not died, and there is always the possibility of a comeback. At the same time, if the × people are at a disadvantage in their military attacks on various fronts, they may take action on the East River to echo the battle situation on all sides and to create containment, which is the × people's usual trick and good play. We should be especially vigilant.</p>
<p>In order to smash the × people's conspiracy, in order for the East River not to fall into the hands of the × people again, we should bravely overcome all shortcomings, actively foster and lead the youth movement, and mobilize the masses to rise up to defend the country and their hometowns. At the same time, we must earnestly relieve refugees and eliminate all kinds of exorbitant taxes and improve people's lives, and thoroughly investigate and punish bandits who take advantage of the crisis to rob and maintain public security. In particular, we must thoroughly investigate those civil servants who willingly act as submissive citizens and attach themselves to the × people, and eliminate national traitors. This is an urgent appeal, and at the same time, I would like to sincerely request the local government to quickly accept it.</p>

<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>The Chinese Drama Troupe Engaged in Cultural Propaganda in New York: Greatly Welcomed by the People There</h3>
<p>The drama troupe engaged in overseas Chinese cultural propaganda, under the leadership of Madame Tang, including musicians, dramatists, and singers, toured the United States this time and performed Chinese dramas for five full nights at the Mercury Theater in New York in early February, with unprecedented success. The news was widely published in newspapers across the United States.</p>
<p>On the last night, Zhao Qixiong. Dr. William, a leader of the American society "Friends of China," delivered a speech, expressing his great respect for the Chinese drama troupe's cultural propaganda tour of the United States. The result of the five-night performance was that it won praise from American drama critics and earned a surplus of approximately US$5,000.</p>
<p>For this performance, on the last night, the United China Relief Association and the American Medical Aid to China also invited the troupe to perform in New York, and then the troupe went on tour to major cities across the United States. Therefore, the performance in New York was actually the first sound of the troupe's performances in the United States.</p>
<p>The New York Times said, "If they come to the United States to perform in order to raise donations for medical assistance, they will receive even greater praise. They have indeed enabled a country with a very rich artistic source to gain many friends overseas. Chinese art has been adhering to Chinese classics for thousands of years. Existing in the realm of ideals, it is pure art."</p>
<p>Among the members of the Chinese drama troupe, the most popular with Americans was Ms. Zhang, who played "Yang Guifei." Her photo was found on American streets, on newspaper and magazine covers, for several weeks in a row. Her fame can also be seen.</p>
<h3>Introduction to First-Run Films: Guiding Girl</h3>
<p>"Guiding Girl" is not a great film. This is obvious, because from the title, you can imagine what it is. The story of the whole film, from beginning to end, is like all erotic films, immersed in an atmosphere of erotic and humorous fun. The writers do not want the audience to receive any inspiration from this "educational weapon." Its highest ambition is only to make the audience laugh loudly during the opening hour and a half. In this way, the film can be 100% guaranteed in terms of business, and these audiences, in this amusing love picture, forget the world and forget society. The anesthetic nature of American films is concretely expressed in these places.</p>
<p>The structure of this film is exactly as mentioned above. It is very funny and also makes people laugh. The playwright has arranged a total of five humorous characters in this story: an engineer who is rich but likes to study cooking; his daughter, a spoiled young lady who falls in love with men; a former Russian nobleman, a prince, who works as a cook in the engineer's home; the head of a business agency, a smart and capable girl; and a young man studying mechanics. The whole play uses these five people to play a complicated love comedy. Here, we must admit that the personalities of these characters are vividly and lively written. The engineer's daughter, as soon as she sees the young Bob, shows a "love at first sight" appearance and has been pursuing him, which is a very cute technique. After the "Prince" cook declares that he is the sold-out Russian prince, the engineer's daughter immediately goes to pursue him and quickly marries him. Here, the psychology of a delicate and vain girl is fully expressed. As for the engineer's confusion, the business agency girl's affection, and the young Bob's straightforwardness, they all make the whole play full of laughter.</p>
<p>The actress Lan Li has a strong grasp of the characters' personalities. The stubborn personality of the business agency girl (Kang Sidenfina) is written, and when she receives a call from the engineer asking her to prepare for the wedding of the young Bob and the engineer's daughter, she is so angry that she smashes the telephone receiver and cuts the power cord, then circles around the office in extreme anger. Underneath this quick movement, not only does the female protagonist's angry emotions appear, but it also reveals the stubborn personality of the smart, capable and competitive girl.</p>
<p>As for the engineer's daughter, who falls in love with every man she sees, her appearance of being lost and slow-moving in the business agency cannot help but make you laugh. When pursuing the young Bob in the basement, she is again a petite and charming "little bird relying on others." Her movements and position show its accuracy.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Ms. Sidenfina, the director of the business agency, is very experienced and pure. This complete urban type actor is very suitable for playing this role. The male lead, Fan Xiupolas, is a newcomer, but he is very calm. The others, such as Mi Xiaaoya's Russian prince and Qiluo Jiluo's engineer, are all humorous and funny. In short, this is a new-style comedy.</p>
<h3>New Makeup Technique</h3>
<p>American movie actors now use a plasticizing substance for facial makeup called "No. 6." This makeup material was invented by movie makeup artist Tom Jack. It has three advantages: (1) Regardless of the facial features, it can be transformed as desired. The simplicity of the procedure is far beyond that of previous makeup techniques. (2) This makeup material is applied to the face to form a thin mask, but various facial expressions, such as smiles, laughter, yawns, and frowns, are still expressed as usual, without the slightest discrepancy. (3) This makeup material is loose in texture and can absorb sweat. It is easy to apply, and when removed, it will not damage the skin.</p>
<p>Robin Lorry, who played Louis XVI in the film "Marie Antoinette," was made up by Tom Jack using "No. 6." It was so lifelike and ingenious that if you compared it with the photo of Louis XVI, you would not believe that he was a Hollywood actor, but would suspect that it was the reincarnation of the French emperor at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>
<h3>The Radio War Between England and Italy: The Same Singer Used One After the Other</h3>
<p>Radio is not only a tool for listeners to pass the time. Politicians in various countries around the world also regard radio as a powerful tool for political propaganda. For example, political parties' election campaigns, heads of state's political views, and government attitudes all use radio broadcasts to reach the general public, and the effect is far greater than holding public speeches in one city or one place. Not only this, but recently, countries have further regarded it as a tool for international political propaganda warfare.</p>
<p>Here, we can give an example. Italy, not long ago, used a singer to broadcast in various parts of the Near East (including Cairo, Baghdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, etc.), and the purpose was to carry out anti-British propaganda. This singer is Abdul-Wahab, a half-blind Muslim. In his romantic compositions, he himself is the main singer. Italy made use of him because the Arabs liked to listen to his songs.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Britain discovered Italy's conspiracy to broadcast to the Arabs, so it also wanted to use radio to counter Italy. Abdul-Wahab got a great opportunity to make a profit in the situation where Britain and Italy were competing in an international propaganda war. At first, his remuneration for broadcasting for Italy was not very high, but later he wanted to increase it to US$400. Italy said that it could not pay such a price, but Britain, for this singer who enjoyed a great reputation among the Arabs, did not hesitate to pay this sum, hoping to achieve the effect of countering Italian propaganda. Abdul-Wahab was immediately pulled over to the British side to do radio propaganda, and the British even had him broadcast the song "Shakespeare's English Song," and the price was increased to US$625, with the aim of publicizing the background of British culture through this song, making the fascists who previously subsidized this singer feel uneasy and embarrassed.</p>

<h3>The Real and Fake Li Huitang Battle, Jia Shan, the Nemesis of the Hong Kong Interport Team, Defeats Xinghua, Whose Performance Was Slightly Better Than the Day Before</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Report] It's warm and then slightly cold, the wind and rain finally settle in the evening. Parting is most heartbreaking near Qingming. Overseas travelers are often sick these days.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, "Heaven Cried," not only breaking the souls of travelers but also dampening the spirits of football fans. Although the Jia Shan match was not changed due to the wind and rain, fighting in the rain is inevitably clumsy. What's the fun in turning a "good show" into a "bubble play"?</p>
<p>Fortunately, by the afternoon, the sky suddenly "smiled," and this football event began at an auspicious time. However, Jia Shan was muddy and slippery after the rain, and the players' movements were slightly less smooth.</p>
<p>The Xinghua football team crossed the ocean with their skills, arriving in Hong Kong from the Philippines, shaking the football city. This team is famous throughout Southeast Asia, deeply admired by football fans. However, they suffered a defeat in their first match, giving the general public the impression that they were not as good as they seemed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they fought again, facing the Hong Kong Interport team, and the scene was quite lively. However, compared to the day before, the number of spectators was reduced by half. The reason is very simple: the crushing defeat the day before, plus yesterday's rain, reduced the interest of many fans.</p>
<p>The "New Li Huitang," Xie Qingfu, who attracted much attention, did indeed play. However, he is large and stout, weighing over 110 pounds, and lacks the agility and finesse of Li Huitang. He waits for opportunities like Sun Shun, who recently played in Shanghai, though he jumps higher and is excellent at heading. His passing also has a "method," but his shots are not always accurate. However, because of his powerful kicks, his shots are as dangerous as artillery shells. Xinghua avoided being "shut out" entirely thanks to his one goal.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's frontline commander, the "genuine" Li Huitang, is indeed different from the "substitute." Because he has great skills and leadership ability, he is united with the team. This alone sets him apart from others. How can Qingfu be compared to him?</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport match, Jia Shan had been reluctant to show his skills. Yesterday, he participated as a practice player, preparing for his upcoming trip to the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Xinghua lineup was more complete than the day before, as two new players were added to the front line, greatly increasing their attacking power. Zhu Chenggui adopted a third inner defender strategy, which was not very effective, but it avoided the concentrated defense of the previous day. Therefore, the team's overall performance was much more energetic than the day before. Their defeat was simply due to inferior skills.</p>
<p>Tsai Yuehan's performance was inferior to the day before. Wen Guanzong's passing and Xie Qingfu's coordination were good. Although Wen Guanzong had a minor foot injury, he performed quite well. All the other players worked very hard.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's lineup differed from the original plan. "Big Iron Shovel" Li Tiansheng and "Vanguard" Hou Chengtuo were both resting, allowing "Tough Guy" Hou Rongsheng and "Little Shi" to play. This affected the team's overall offense and defense. Yi Shi Dulan, who initially played as the left winger, was "stubborn" and missed many opportunities. Feng and Li, the two domestic forwards, one specialized in passing, and the other specialized in finding opportunities, were inseparable. However, Li Huitang hesitated to shoot several times. People said he was lazy, but I say he was "showing mercy."</p>
<p>The entire match was not very exciting, and the atmosphere was tepid. In the first half, the Hong Kong team had more advantages, but because of Xinghua's strong resistance, they only scored one goal. In the second half, both sides had equal opportunities. Therefore, although the Hong Kong team won by two goals, Xinghua also scored one, ending the match with a score of 3-1. (By the Football Field God)</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Two minutes: Jia Shan breaks through and passes the flag, Yi Shi Dulan receives on the wing, enters a corner, and launches a powerful shot. Everyone thought a goal was certain, but Li Bai-tang turned around and made a fierce save, deflecting the ball out of the corner.</p>
<p>Seven minutes: Cheng Zhen and Li Huitang compete for the ball. The "ball freak" is indeed fierce, snatching the line and hooking it to Jingxiang, who is left unguarded. Jingxiang shoots a blank, sending the ball high and out.</p>
<p>Twelve minutes: The Xinghua forwards, unwilling to be insulted, launch an all-out attack. Haizhu crosses to Lie Wu, who heads the ball, but it goes slightly high.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes: Anbashen gets a pass from Bi Ludo on the right wing. Huitang tries to intercept the ball but slips. Jia Shan happens to be in a perfect position and shoots without hesitation, scoring the first goal. (1-0)</p>
<p>Twenty-eight minutes: Xinghua attacks once. Haizhu cuts in, and although Yuehan manages to get past, his final kick is inaccurate. Then Qingfu heads a brilliant ball in the Hong Kong team's territory, passing slightly over the crossbar.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>Five minutes: Qingfu chases the ball on the edge of the Hong Kong defense, gets the ball, and passes it to the left of the goal. Yuehan misjudges the situation and misses the opportunity. Shortly after, Yuehan cuts in beautifully, redeeming himself. Jun Qian sees the unfavorable situation and jumps high to save before the opponent's forward arrives, making a graceful pose.</p>
<p>Twelve minutes: The Hong Kong team continues to attack relentlessly. Guan indicates the team to return and defend, wanting to protect the midfield. However, Huitang seizes the opportunity to pass to Jia Shan, who shoots decisively again. Bai Tang tries to dive and block the shot, but cannot prevent the ball from entering the net. (2-0)</p>
<p>Seventeen minutes: The Hong Kong team attacks again like an overwhelming force. Bai Tang rides alone from the city. At this time, "Little Shi" receives a pass from the middle, advances to the side of the goal, and should easily score into the open net. But the result is a shot wide into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes: Lie Wu leaves the field, the situation is gone, but Yuehan is still active, cooperating with Qingfu, sneaking across the blood valley pass, and finally shooting the ball into the net in the confusion, breaking the duck egg. (1-2)</p>
<p>Twenty-two minutes: As the applause for Xinghua's winning goal subsides, Huitang, assisted by Little Shi, dribbles past two defenders and fires a ground ball, flying into the capital, making it 3-1. A moment later, the final whistle blows, and the Hong Kong team wins.</p>

<h3>The Oriental Football Team Marches South Yesterday, a Group of Fifteen Players and Staff</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Elementary School Physical Education - Daily Morning Exercises to Be Implemented - Implementation Guidelines Decided</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education considers physical education to be a basic requirement for self-defense. However, training cannot be effectively applied to adults and the elderly. It must be applied to elementary school children first to be effective. Since a person's health is determined during childhood, the importance of physical education in elementary schools should be vigorously promoted, especially during this period of intense war. The Ministry of Education now orders all public and registered private elementary schools in each province and city to follow the Ministry's regulations and implement daily morning exercises before class. The implementation guidelines for elementary school physical education are recorded as follows: A. Based on the school's environment: (1) Location, (2) Equipment, (3) Economy, B. Based on the student's level: (1) Motor ability, (2) Knowledge ability, C. Based on local conditions: (1) Social aspects, (2) Habits, D. Based on the value of teaching materials: (1) Exercise can be done anytime, anywhere, (2) Inspire good behavior in children, (3) Other.</p>

<h3>Open Basketball Tournament - Lefang Defeats Police - South China Wins in Group B - Only Two Matches Tonight</h3>
<p>In the open men's basketball tournament, South China narrowly defeated International 37-36 in the first Group B match yesterday.</p>
<p>In the second Group A match, Oriental defeated Police. Based on past records, Police could not be dismissed as a pushover to Oriental. Yesterday, under the tenacious resistance of the Police, although they lost 47-52, they once led 39-37. They were tied several times in the 15 minutes before the end of the game. The Police's ability to achieve this result was not accidental. During the game, the Oriental team was at most one point ahead. If the Police had not lost three points in a row due to a defender's foul in the last two minutes, the outcome would have been hard to predict. However, the Oriental team was greatly affected by Xu Heng's absence due to the football team's expedition. Feng Nianhua and Huang Dingfen also did not perform well. Only Chen Zongqi was outstanding, saving many dangerous balls.</p>
<p>The Police were most indebted to the three Indian players. Because of their height and long arms, they had many advantages. They dominated the rebounding and had several opportunities to score on second chances. However, their shooting form was poor, and they missed scoring opportunities. Their lack of teamwork was also a reason for their failure. Their passing often failed to avoid interception by the opponent, and their receiving was often light and unstable. Therefore, although the players had superior height, they were ultimately restricted by the skills of both sides. With proper training, they would certainly improve quickly.</p>
<p>During the game, Feng Nianhua opened the scoring for Oriental, followed by Luo Zhian. Then Police Nalin scored two consecutive baskets. Afterward, both sides scored alternately, and the score was tied at 10-10 and 12-12. Then Oriental scored with baskets by Huang Dingfen, Feng Nianhua, and Xu Duzhong. At the end of the first half, Oriental led 21-17.</p>
<p>After the change of ends, Feng Nianhua showed his strength. Oriental led 29-26 and 35-32. Then Police Chen Jinkui and Nalin became unstoppable, creating a tense situation with the score tied at 37-37 and 47-47. Until the last two minutes, Oriental took advantage of Feng Nianhua's free throws and scored two consecutive points, resulting in a 52-47 victory for Oriental.</p>
<p>In the last Group B match, Wah Hung defeated Hoi Kwong 75-24.</p>

<h3>Morning Exercise Materials</h3>
<p>— Outstanding</p>
<p>Regarding the effectiveness of morning exercises, everyone has gained considerable understanding from this publication. I believe everyone will have developed the determination to practice. From determination comes a kind of restlessness. Although everyone has not spoken to me about this, I can predict it. That is the question of how to exercise. It seems that I have only told people the benefits of morning exercises without guiding them on how to do them. It is like presenting a plate of delicious food in front of everyone but failing to invite everyone to actually eat it, causing everyone to be longing. I am truly sorry. Please forgive me. Now I will introduce the teaching materials for a 20-minute morning exercise, so that everyone can know, can do, and after doing it, can benefit... Regarding the content of the teaching materials, they are based on flexibility exercises and medical exercises. The curriculum is arranged from shallow to deep, from easy to difficult, from simple to complex. Each teaching material is used for one week, that is, each issue is changed once a week. The order of each teaching material can be roughly divided into seven to eight sections. The main exercises are: (1) Head and neck exercises (2) Upper limb exercises (3) Lower limb exercises (4) Chest and back exercises (5) Waist and abdominal exercises (6) Combined limb exercises or combined limb and trunk exercises (7) Fast or jump exercises (8) Breathing exercises, etc. Complete them in 20 minutes. The number of times for each section varies depending on the level (physical fitness), roughly limited to eight to thirty-two times (one to four eight-beats). However, after each section is completed, there should be a considerable amount of rest or stepping (or walking) to prepare for the next section. Now I will describe the teaching materials for the first week in order. As for the second, third week... they will be published every Sunday.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Sofa</h3>
<p>— Du Ai</p>
<p>"If one could say that a sofa is something that makes people sit down and not want to get up," a friend who had just come from the mainland said to me with a sigh, "then Hong Kong is a sofa. If you sit on it for too long, even the desire to stand up will be consumed!"</p>
<p>I understand what he means. I remember that before he left Hong Kong, he was often tormented by this "sofa problem."</p>
<p>"Honestly," he said with a sense of loss when he left, "living here for a long time is annoying. But when it comes to deciding to leave, I feel reluctant."</p>
<p>I think he was not exaggerating. Relatively speaking, his life was "simply stable." People who choose this kind of life tend to feel like they are sitting on a sofa. However, an intellectual like him, living in a city with a sense of poverty, began to feel uneasy when he encountered the smoke of gunpowder at Daya Bay. Seeing other young people eagerly mobilizing to return to their hometowns, he felt even more the alluring power of this sofa. Yes, although his life made him feel like he was sitting on a sofa, he was still young, pure, and full of enthusiasm. Gradually, he felt that he should move like other people. Two days before he left, he told me that he had decided to stand up from the "sofa." Only then did I believe that he was really going to return to China with the young soldiers to serve the country. I shook his hand tightly:</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>In the days after he left, I often thought of his melancholy shadow in my spare time. I thought: the fiery life in the mainland would temper him, but I also thought that he might return to the sofa!</p>
<p>Indeed, one day three months later, he suddenly appeared at my house late at night. After sitting down, he said the opening sentence. Although I understood what he meant, I was still doubtful.</p>
<p>"What? Are you planning to fall back into the sofa?"</p>
<p>"No!" he said aggressively, as if resisting an insult.</p>
<p>"Then, what necessary things made it imperative for you to come back?"</p>
<p>He wriggled his head, preparing to say a lot, but in the end, he said only a short sentence seriously:</p>
<p>"I came back for cadres. There is a cadre panic in the mainland!"</p>
<p>"Then, have you contacted your rear support?"</p>
<p>"I have. However, our fellow villagers' association can only provide me with five people, and they are all without any work experience. Why is it that people in your cultural circles seem so unenthusiastic about training cadres and mobilizing people to return to the country?" Because he felt that his attitude was earnest, he finally smiled slightly.</p>
<p>I told him that almost all the good cadres of various groups had already set off with various service teams. There is also a cadre panic in the youth salvation groups here!</p>
<p>In this way, we slowly began to talk about the situation in the mainland. He was really excited. He told me that the work in the occupied areas was arduous and as chaotic as hemp. When they first arrived in the occupied areas, the people had fled, and the food had also been taken away. All that could be seen were burned buildings, dead villages, and flies and rats, ruling the areas destroyed by the enemy. The incomplete corpses of the people who had been murdered were rotting "everywhere." Wild dogs were holding cruel feasts. The bloody smell, mixed with the biting north wind of December, pierced his nerves even more deeply. Seeing this tragedy of human suffering, the desolate wilderness, the intense urgency and sadness, filled the hearts of political workers with deep pain. After many days of effort, the staff gradually brought back the farmers who were hiding in the mountains, constantly holding village meetings, working patiently village by village with the patience that people involved in popular movements should have. Slowly, the foundation of popular armed forces was established, order was gradually restored, and there were many innovations. The people began to consciously support the war of resistance. However, some places were also very bad. The relationship between the army and the people had not yet begun to be newly established. The people were afraid of the army and equally afraid of the bandits. Traitors could still operate openly. The looting of bandits, the rampant smuggling, and the defeatist emotions of the people were everywhere. However, on the one hand, the people were comforted by the enemy, and a sense of peace was born. Once the "Imperial Army" swept through, they became extremely panicked again. The people had no organization and were even more scattered than during the war. His conclusion was that although the situation was like this, the war did change many things. Especially recently, because there was news that the enemy was going to conduct a new "sweep," the stubborn and dark historical sediment also began to change. The people slowly awakened through the lessons of blood. On the whole, everything was beginning to change, beginning to be reborn... He said that he was also beginning to be reborn.</p>
<p>"Then, in your work, do you miss this seaside sofa?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"No, that is already in the past. I have already found another sofa, which is the vast wilderness of the motherland! When I first arrived in the mainland, as soon as I came into contact with that lovely wilderness, a kind of unprecedented warm and affectionate feeling intensely moved me. For the first time, I truly felt the greatness of the motherland. I love the wilderness, even though she is being trampled by the enemy and is in a state of defeat, she is using her hidden infinite power to cultivate the seeds of freedom on herself!"</p>
<p>"Then, after you left, have you never had any nostalgia for the sofa?"</p>
<p>"At first, because the change in life was too difficult to adapt to all at once, I was nostalgic. But soon, I gave up. I want to announce to everyone: return to the mainland, live and fight in the embrace of the motherland. She will make you feel unparalleled happiness, she will make you deeply feel that you are the creators of a world full of glory for your ancestors!" He was a little dazed with excitement. He gazed tranquilly and solemnly at the night outside the window, saying to himself, "In such a great era, only the dying class can sit comfortably on the sofa."</p>
<p>He walked to the table, poured a cup of tea, held it up, and began to ponder thoughtfully, saying:</p>
<p>"The sofa, in certain situations, reasonable situations, it is not impossible to treat it as a moment of rest." He finished the cup of tea in one gulp and sighed happily: "But treating it as a life will wear down people's will; and the person sitting on it will become like a stupid wolf."</p>
<p>I enthusiastically agreed with his opinion. I said:</p>
<p>"For some people, it is accurate to treat Hong Kong as a sofa. However, this sofa is surrounded by gunpowder! However, there are many people who do not treat her as a sofa, people who are not qualified to treat her as a sofa. Not being buried by the sofa, and living a truly solid life, is our iron rule of struggle. As long as people can really do that, this iron rule can be quoted everywhere..."</p>
<p>Looking at the watch, it was almost one o'clock. So, I quickly brought the bed board and arranged a place for him to sleep.</p>
<p>I pointed to the neatly stacked board bed and said to my guest:</p>
<p>"Treat it as a sofa! You deserve to rest now."</p>
<p>He hugged me and laughed like a child. Liu Feng</p>
<h3>"Silent Triumph"</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>Returning home with "silence" and "triumph" seems to be something that doesn't exist in the world. In theory, "triumph" should be so lively—"the whole country is ecstatic," "triumph" will become incredible.</p>
<p>However, our friendly nation has this "thing" called "silent triumph." The reason why I call our "friendly nation's" "silent triumph" a "thing" is not to imply any irony. It is really because this "silent triumph" is a "first creation," and my writing style is very clumsy, and I can't find a suitable term for a while. There is no way, I have to treat "silent triumph" as a "thing."</p>
<p>Forcing the girls in women's schools to hold small paper national flags, gently singing clear and crisp songs, and motivating the "soldiers" who are "going to war," this is touted as very lively news in the "friendly nation's" newspapers. However, when the "soldiers" who "went to war" were put in bottles and brought back as "ashes," the "Kyoto Daily News" in the "friendly nation" called it "silent triumph!"</p>
<p>The "friendly nation's" war to "build a new order in East Asia" on our Chinese territory is indeed victorious every day. This can be seen from the fact that their domestic newspapers have "silent triumph" every day.</p>
<p>"Ashes" will certainly not "speak," but sacrificing one's "life" to complete the "holy war" is called "triumph" by the newspapers, so it is certainly "silent."</p>
<p>However, since "ashes" will not speak, the closest relatives and friends related to "ashes," and by extension, the "candidates" for "ashes," and the supporters of "truth," they will speak. Even in this "silent triumph" published in the "Kyoto Daily News," there is a tragic "language of ashes."</p>
<p>That is, the wife of this "silent triumphant," after taking a bath and dressing neatly, went to the grave of her husband, this "silent triumphant," to commit suicide. Although the wife "committed suicide," it is clear that the "ashes" borrowed the wife's "suicide" to make a "tragic accusation" to the people of the whole country!</p>
<p>In addition, the "anti-war slogans" that are repeatedly found in the streets of Tokyo are also the "silent words" of the "silence" of a kind of "triumph." As for the explosion of the Osaka gunpowder factory, that is a kind of "thunderous joy" because it is "triumphing" every day and cannot bear to "remain silent!"</p>
<p>"Triumph" will never be "silent." Even if there is one in the "Kyoto Daily News," it is just the "silent triumph" of another small part of the "friendly nation," right? If not, it is a kind of "self-consolation" because the "purpose" cannot be achieved in "three months."</p>
<p>"Silent triumph" was created by Japanese fascist warlords, but it is also their only gain in China!</p>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p>— Huang Lu</p>
<p>The stove is burning dry leaves</p>
<p>The four walls are dark and damp</p>
<p>Because tomorrow</p>
<p>I will go far away</p>
<p>Mother! Please</p>
<p>Feed my horse well</p>
<p>When the neighbor's rooster crows</p>
<p>I will set off</p>
<p>I will take down</p>
<p>Grandfather's saber</p>
<p>Grandfather's pistol</p>
<p>And gallop towards the distant dawn</p>
<h3>Spring Mist</h3>
<p>— He Chengjiang</p>
<p>Spring mist covers the ocean, spring mist covers the green mountains, spring mist covers the earth, and the people of the earth live in the spring mist.</p>
<p>A gray and hazy mass of gas in the sky hovers over the ocean. Ships have reduced their speed and are sailing slowly. The light of the lighthouse is buried by the gas and is not clear at all.</p>
<p>People hold a "mysterious" mood, looking down, looking up, and looking straight. From this shore, you cannot see the other shore. From the sidewalk under this arcade, you cannot clearly see people's true faces across the sidewalk. However, the sea of people is flowing horizontally...</p>
<p>The sea lies lazily, breathing lifelessly...</p>
<p>I hold a mood of melancholy on the seashore, but I don't feel the "joy" of "the spring sun calling me with smoky scenery." On the contrary, what I am indignant about is the smoke of war everywhere in the motherland!</p>
<p>—Alas!</p>
<p>With a slight sigh, my heart is filled with longing for the motherland. I want to exhaust my vision to look forward to the great face of the motherland, but the misty spring mist on the sea prevents me from seeing the motherland.</p>
<p>Although many people are happy not to see the flames of war in the motherland here, not to hear the sound of cannons in the motherland, and to live in a dull and hazy spring mist, enjoying a curtain of misty rain, listening to the clear sound of flower sellers, and wandering in this paradise, my heart is not here.</p>
<p>I only long for the white sun in the sky to eliminate the spring mist on the sea, or for a heavy rain and strong wind to fall happily, arousing the ocean's awakening, arousing the sea waves' roar, like the tragic songs of the brave men of Yan and Zhao, echoing under the sky. When the rain stops and the wind calms down, we will once again bet that a sky full of white sun and blue is far better than being trapped in a dull and heavy mist.</p>
<p>I am annoyed by the spring mist, I hate the spring mist. The smoky scenery of spring has bewitched so many people, lost so much spirit, and worn away so many lofty ambitions. Annoying spring mist!</p>
<p>Ah! Spring mist, I hate you, I am annoyed by you, spreading on the sea, spreading in the sky, making me unable to see the motherland, but my heart will penetrate your net and return to the embrace of the motherland!</p>
<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>He and she are still standing in place. Time has passed. Snow has accumulated on his and her shoulders. Fortunately, there is no third night walker on this road besides him and her. He should be grateful for this dead and silent snowy night, which hides his secret for him. But who can guarantee that there will be no accidents during a long stay?</p>
<p>The white snow, the black sky, are very simple and clear, as if they are the two sides of his body and mind. He feels his own incompetence and insignificance in this universe of white and black. He is deeply troubled by her non-resistance. Kill her? She is innocent, and it is not the original purpose, and, is his work record still the same blank as when he came? Let her go? Of course, that is her wish, to go happily, so is the result of his work just a knife wound? Permanent stay? Staying is without results, right? He shook his head silently, negating everything. But what is affirmative?……</p>
<p>The sigh of the strong is precious. Finally, he sighed softly, and had to put the useless pistol back into his clothes. He knew that it could no longer help him, so he might as well put it away to show respect for the other party. Then, he cautiously walked away two steps, trying to restrain his angry and worried face, and replaced it with inexplicable joy and humility.</p>
<p>If he was the strongest just now, then he is the weakest now. The former is a heavenly horse flying freely in the sky, and everywhere he sees is a smooth road; the latter, although it is him, is because he was carelessly knocked down from the heavenly realm by heavy snow and strong winds. After falling, he was tied with reins. His strong and weak body kept moving back and forth in the short distance. He was like a believer conquered by religion, walking in front of her with a pious mood, and kept saying good things:</p>
<p>"...If I have offended you, please forgive me, forgive the starving and freezing volunteers... The Chinese should help them, guide them... I came this time to ask you to help them, guide them..."</p>
<p>It was like a confession in front of a god, begging; these words were going to nothingness, and the result was no response.</p>
<p>He wronged himself for the sake of work—but there was a limit to it. When it exceeded this limit, suddenly, he grabbed her and dragged her away. (Twenty-six)</p>
