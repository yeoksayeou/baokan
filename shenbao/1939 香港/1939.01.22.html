<h3 id="c1">英美對日之經濟報復 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 柏菴</p>
<p>自武漢廣州陷落以後，日本郎高唱建立「東亞新秩序」，在佔領區域實行經濟獨佔，排斥第三國利益。在華北實行貿易統制，在華中藉口私運軍火，航行危險，拒絕第三國船隻航行揚子江，故目前華北日貨已佔進口貨値半數以上。長江流域之日貨亦自第三位躍居第一位，所謂門戶開放機會均等原則，已根本打破，最近日本更公然聲稱九國公約之舊原則已不適用於新局勢，竟欲片面毀約。在此現狀之下，英美祗有决定退出遠東與否。英國在華數十年之慘淡經營，已具根蒂。近年對華貿易，雖見衰退，而投資仍佔第一位，美國投資雖少，而貿易則常居第一位。故英美自不甘恝置其以往苦心經營之事業，退出中國市塲。近因抗議之無效，已考慮經濟之報復。</p>
<p>經濟制裁之效力。</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭，國聯經濟制裁失敗以後，對於經濟制裁之效果，表示懷疑者頗不乏人。按意阿戰爭，在一九三五年十月初旬爆發，十一月間，國際聯盟會開會，决議對意施行經濟制裁，國聯五十八會員國中除意阿兩當事國及奧地利，匈牙利，阿爾巴尼，巴拉圭等國拒絕制裁外，參加制裁者計五十二國，制裁辦法爲（一）財政上斷絕往來（二）貿易上則禁止意貨輸入，禁止軍用品及鑛產品金屬品運往意國。自國聯制裁辦法實行以後，意大利亦以抵制參加制裁國貨物進口，爲報復手段，並施行金融，貿易，消費等項統制，以爲對抗。加以意國爲入超國家，近年入超常在二十萬萬里拉以上，對外貿易，以德美爲最大。進出口德國均佔第一位，進口佔百分之十七，出口佔百分之十六。美國居第二位。而該兩國皆爲非會員國，無履行國聯議案之義務，日本及巴西亦然，會員國中之瑞士，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫等國又藉口毘連意境，有密切之貿易關係，對于制裁辦法聲明保留。各國實行之步驟，旣不一致。辦法亦不澈底，如煤汽油始終未禁止輸意，故國聯之制裁辦法，未能使意國停止止侵略戰爭。一九三六年六月英國首倡對意撤銷制裁，各國相繼踵之，近世史上經濟制裁，一幕，由此告終。</p>
<p>經濟制裁對日之影響</p>
<p>在軍事上日本與意大利之情形不同，意阿戰爭，爲時僅半年餘，卽吿收東，經濟制裁之效力未見，而阿已亡。日本對華用兵一年有半，兩套本錢已盡（松岡洋右謂日本有三套本錢（一）政府準備金（二）社會上遊資（三）民間物力）而戰事結束遙遙無期。平沼組閣，意在强化法西斯統制，征發民間物力，以圖一逞；無如在華已陷泥淖，再遇外來震撼，必難支撐。</p>
<p>在國際貿易上，日意之情形亦迥然不同，對日經濟制裁爲英美所提倡，而日本對英美之貿易，約佔其全部貿易半數以上。一九三七年日貨運銷英國及英屬地達九萬萬日元，運美貨物，亦達六萬萬元，佔日本出口貿易之一半。同年英國及英屬地貨物，運入日本達十二萬萬元，美貨輸日亦達十二萬七千萬元。佔日本進口貿易額三分之一。日本對英美貿易關係如此鉅大，一朝英美施行經濟制裁，其影饗之嚴重，槪可想見。</p>
<p>就美日貿易貨品方面觀察，日本貨物運銷美國以絲爲大宗，年約三萬萬元，棉布次之·年約五千萬元，再次爲衣着用品及磁噐，陶器等。美貨運日以棉花爲最多，年約三萬萬元，煤汽油及金屬品次之，各約一萬萬元，再次爲軍械及機器等。自貿易數量言之，美國爲出超，日本爲入超，美佔優勢。自貨品性質言之，美國運往日本貨物，多爲必需品，如煤汽油，金屬品，機器等均爲日本國防上工業上所必需。卽棉花一項，因中國產量·尙不敷日本需要，亦爲不可或缺之原料。日本運往美國之貨物，則屬消耗品性質。如美國在商業上制裁日本，在國內不致發生惡劣影響，而日本則受重大損失，卽如　絲一項，若美國銷路斷絕，日本農村經濟，立受打擊。</p>
<p>英日貿易與美日情形相同，日貨運往英國本部，以海味食品爲大宗，年達三千萬元，生絲，棉布次之。英國本部貨物運日以機器，船艇爲大宗，年約二千萬元，金屬品次之。英貨爲必　品，日貨爲消耗品，日貨且居出　地位，故英日貿易，日本最佔優勢。至日本與英國屬地之貿易情形，幾爲製成品與原料品之交換性質。如日本每年輸入印度棉花約三萬萬元，而每年棉織品運往印度約二萬萬元。澳洲羊毛，每年運銷日本約一萬萬元，小麥約二千萬元，而日本棉織品運入澳洲年達五千萬元。設英國殖民地對日斷絕貿易往來，則日本製成品缺少市塲，原料　乏來源，工業爲之窒息。</p>
<p>最近日本與英美貿易統計（單位百萬日元）</p>
<p>英美何以尙不發動經濟制裁？</p>
<p>日本旣資源貧乏，依賴對外貿易，英美之經濟壓力，自爲日本之致命打擊，何以英美不採積極行動？在政治上之原因，非本人討論之範圍，在商業上之原因，爲一部份商人之阻撓。如印度之棉花，五金業者，澳洲之羊毛小麥商人，美國之棉花，機噐，煤、油等商行，皆以自身之利益關係，反對對日制裁。在英美政府方面又慮相互報復，引起嚴重糾紛，美國畢　門謂經濟制裁，可以使侵略者就範。而波拉則謂經濟制裁足以引起戰爭。按經濟制裁是否足以引起戰端，在理論上並無一定之結論，要視實際情彩如何，日本在經濟上軍事上能否反抗英美，爲問題之關鍵。吾人以爲英美果取聯合陣綫，决心遏止日人侵略行爲，日本軍閥未必卽挺而走險。特英美之畏戰心理，適足以長侵略國之氣燄，而施展其恫嚇之技。去年九月間國聯曾請各會員國個別的對華經濟援助及對制裁，日本政府發言人卽以如果列强改變中立，日本將攷慮對於在華外人租界之態度以爲恐嚇。按英美之在華利益，大部在上海，據萊末氏之統計，英國在華投資十一萬九千萬金，上海佔四分之三。美國在華投資一萬萬千萬美金，上海佔百分之六十四。此外英美在日本之投資，據英國「王家國際事務研究院」一九三七出版之「國際投資問題」之紀載，美國在日投資，至一九三三年底共達四萬四千萬美金。大部爲政府倩券，較在華投資約多一倍。英國在日投資，一九三零年估計爲六千三百萬鎊，與在華投資之十一萬萬美金相較，僅合四分之一，但據一九三七年十二月經濟新聞登載金德萊氏之估計，一九三六年底，英國在日本投資爲五千三百萬鎊（大部爲政府債券）。在中國投資爲四千一百萬鎊。是英國對日本投資較在華投資爲大，與萊末氏之估計結果相反。確實情形仍待玫證。要之無論在日在華之投資均處日人勢力之下，英美對日嚴厲的經濟制裁之實行，或存投鼠忌噐之心理歟？</p>
<p>英美報復之利害比較</p>
<p>英國在商業上，報復日本所遇之困難，是暫時的，且自英帝國全部經濟上言之，則無寗謂爲有利，如紡織業英國向感日貨競爭之痛苦，對日制裁以後，印度之棉花，澳洲之羊毛輸日雖減，而英國棉毛紡業，必見繁榮，則棉毛原料，卽可由英國本部消納。美國之棉花亦然，默戰以前，日本每年輸入國外棉花不過一百萬包，英國達四百萬包，後因日本紡織業興盛，英國衰落，及一九三五年日本輸入外棉增至三百六十萬包，英國減至二百餘包。數十年來之世界棉花貿易額，始終在一千二百萬包左右一每包毛重五百磅凈重四七八磅）無大漲落。故美棉銷路仍可囘至英國。其他美貨如煤，油，機噐等品均非依賴日本爲顧客。至於顧慮所謂日本之報復，則觀於英美對華貸欵時日本之動靜，可知其爲未必然之事也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">抗×戰術之研究 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<p>與改進部隊之要務（三）</p>
<p>第二，各部隊要注重機動力與協同心，我們無論運　何種戰術，要獲得戰鬥的成果，部隊的機動力和協同心，是必不可少的要件，現在各部隊的戰鬥編制，大衆都知這要有機動性，但是總不曾作到，一有行動，不能機敏也速達成任務！以後必須養成部隊的機動性，指揮部署，要適切，宜；行軍　能，要盡量提高；要注重夜間行動，利用交通用具，這些，都是增大機動力的緊要條件，部隊有了大的機　力，纔能够應付現代立體戰爭，纔能够發揮戰鬥力量，利用挫趣機會，打破×人，至於協同心，關係戰爭勝敗，尤爲重要，我　纔說過，×人對我軍慣行各個擊破的戰術，欲使我們部隊失却聯絡。我們就要養成官兵協同動作的習慣和按能，尤其我們要運用正面以攻爲守，而以主力預備隊　行側背攻　的戰術，必須全部官兵人人有協同動作的精神和本領，　能够獲得攻守成果。還有×人攻擊我軍，專擊我兵力單薄或陣地空隙處打進來，因此各個部隊鄰接的地方，我們要佈置預備隊，確實聯絡，如×人攻打我陣地一點，左右隣近部隊，必須協同動作，援助友軍，殲滅×人，要知道：大敵當前，我全國軍人，生死成敗是整　的，决沒有友軍敗亡，而我仍能存在—此際决沒有保存實力的餘地。如要保存實力，就必蹈僞滿軍隊的覆轍，陷於生不能生，死不能死的慘　悲　，要被×軍拿了機關槍趕赴戰場來殺自己的同胞，我們革命軍人，是非要辨別淸楚，利害要看得分明。今日只有大家同生死。共患難，爲殺×救國，協同抗戰，要根本劇除過去軍人講派　，分彼此，坐視友軍犧牲，保存自己實力的亡國心理—一定要全國軍人合爲一體，協同一致，纔能够完成抗戰救國的任務—</p>
<p>第三要力求主動·主動的要訣，就是我　定一個計劃，逐步實施、迫使×人　着我軍的計劃來活動。明白一點說，就是要「攻其所必救，取其所必爭」，使他們自守自救之不暇，處處陷於被動；×人成了被動，我們就可以發揮戰鬥力量來擊破他，現在×人深入我們內地，戰綫延長，戰區擴大，正是我們厲行主動攻戰　好機會，以後無論攻守，我們都要　於主動；要立於宅動，就要我們參謀長在定謀决計的時候，有敏銳的眼光，和堅决的魄力—根據詳　的敵情，决定一切的戰略，像我上面所說打破×人『錐形突擊』的側擊戰術，就是主動的以攻爲守的唯一妙訣—我們這個戰術定了下來，以後各位冉要就各戰塲中×我實際情　審機度勢，確切實施。惟事事制×於機先，時時能保持主動，才能够獲得戰術戰略的成功！</p>
<p>以上是講打破×人『錐形突擊』慣技的戰術和運用戰術的必要條件，現在再要講到今後作戰部隊亟應改進的幾件要務：</p>
<p>第一·要善待俘虜·並獎賞戰利品的繳獲和保存·這次作戰，已在半年以上，前方各部隊極少解送俘虜與戰利品上來，這就表示我們作戰部隊知或缺乏，程度不够，不知道有了俘虜，我們就可以審訊×情，而目優待俘　，是戰時軍人應有的道德，是瓦解×軍，要的方法。有了各種戰利品，就是研究×情最可寶的材料，現在前方官兵，捉了俘虜，隨便殺害，得了×人許多裝具文件！—作戰侖令計劃等都隨便散失或丟掉，有硏究的材料，不知呈上來，獲得有價値的戰利品，不知硏究保存。這都是我們平時部隊敎育不完善的結果！×人不然，得了我一鞋一帽，片紙隻字，都繳上去，作爲研究的參考，重要的東西，研究之後，還要整理登記，標明物件名稱，部隊番號，官兵姓名，獲得的時間和地點，彙存在歷　陳列館，作爲侵略的敎材—我們現在要硏究×情，缺乏材料，要爲神聖抗戰留　此次有價値的紀念，來安慰抗戰殉國的英靈，垂示後世子孫　的歷史敎訓，而前方的戰利品，沒有逐件呈繳上來，這是亟應改進的一件事，以後大家要特別吿戒部下官兵，第一不許殺害俘虜，並要限令解送上來；第二，無論繳獲×人大小東西，不論是一槍一刀，一衣一帽，一片紙，一行字，部要呈　指揮部，遞呈車事委員會研究，保管·我們高級指揮官和參謀長，要　種種方法敎　部下，並須依照前次所頒作戰獎　辦法所規定，實行賞，使他們知道拿獲俘虜和戰利品，是極有　勞，極榮譽的一件事，也是我們官乓在抗戰史中留下英名最難得的個機會要使各個官兵都有此知識，人人以善待俘虜　解戰利品爲榮，我們的教育如能　生這極效果，無形中就可以增加部隊很大的戰鬥力量！</p>
<p>第二，命令要求貫澈，對　執行命令　要嚴密　餐。大　要知道：軍隊的命令，就是全軍生侖所寄　的一個號令。命令能否執行執行能否貫澈，關係全軍生命的安危和存亡—故任何命令，不論授兩方，　要鄭重將事，澈底實行，决　好有絲毫輕易疏忽或執行　忠實的地方—各位還　知道：上官頒下一　　令，他就是指示我們生命的一條道路，我們服從命令，</p>

<p>【昆明特約通訊】雲南僻居邊遠、新聞事業、向以交通文化及其他種種關係、不甚發達、最早出版之報紙、於淸末光緒年間、耶與世人相見、惟當時民衆、因　氣閉塞，對報紙之認識、旣不如今日之人手一紙，視之如　神食糧，且對記者均如貌視、亦如昔日之上海，故言雲南報紙、雖有二十餘年之歷史·而推進社會改良風化之身，尙未易見也，茲將雲南現存各　情形、介紹如次·</p>
<p>（一）民國日報，爲省黨部所辦，社長汪頌魯，編輯晏祝候·社址在華山南路，　出二千六百餘號。每星期二，四，六有中央宣傳　所撰之社論，指示人民對　戰中應有之認識，有　刊「大觀」。前以抗戰縮減篇幅停刊，近目本年元旦起，鑒於同業益世報有年園地等專刊，朝報亦有副，故已遂日登散文小說等，恢復舊觀，銷路約七八千份。</p>
<p>（二）雲南日報，爲省政府之機關報。社長陳科，編輯張克誠。社址在文廟橫街·與省立昆華民　敎育館望　相對，銷路遍雲南全省各州縣廳，約在一萬三千上下，爲雲南各報銷略之最廣者。本地新聞頗爲詳盡，已出至一千零五十號，近除擴充社務·招添事務人員外。于去年十二月—二日起·又將因戰事改爲週刊之「南風」——附恢復，每大只能登「四千字，載小說，散文，詩歌，筆記等等，性質與民國日報之附刊「大觀」相同。蓋或鑒於硬性新聞之缺少伸縮性而有以　濟之也。該　之星　評論，係特約國內著名作家撰述，每篇酬金至少在國幣十元以上。</p>
<p>現在昆明出版之日報，除民國日報雲南日報二家外，尙有新商報（社長王漢聲，編　胡錚，）社會新報（社長龍子敏，編輯土秀　，）大無畏報（社長　仁輔，編輯馬仲靈，）義聲報（社長字鉅裁，編輯李筱邨，）均報（社長段全昌，編　趙雨生）等五家。惟比較進步銷路較廣者，在去年雙十節前，只此雲南及民國日報二家而已。</p>
<p>南京朝報，於前年冬隨首都淪陷，而被迫撤退，經理王公弘來導籌備多時，於廿七年雙十節在此恢復出版，每天一小張，版式人小與在南京時相同，第一版國內電報，第二版國際消息，第三版本埠新聞，第四版副刊，銷路約七八千。初出版時，早晨七時許，卽聞報販滿街叫賣，一般民衆，以其出版甚早，故多爲　閱，即比一來，，日出版　還之　南及民國日報，乃不得不相　競爭特別提早發行，此外來之影響，無形中使愛讀報紙者便利多多矣。</p>
<p>朝報而起者，有廿六年八月因抗戰被爆×壓迫　刊之天津益世　·——分卽中國公敎之宣傳機關報。該報由于斌主敎之領導，先于去年雙十節在此發　「益世週報一，旋于十二月八日又將日報恢復，每天出報一大張，除間有各地待約通信外，逐日並有宗敎與文化，邊疆，史學，敎育，讀書，婦女，靑年園地，　書等週刊。此爲昆明各報之所無，乃該報之特色，頗爲靑年學生所愛讀，惟該報本地新聞甚少，似未注意，有美中不足之嫌。</p>
<p>昆明雲南日報及民國日報報價，在記者初來時——二十七年七月，預訂每月僅國幣六角，零　每汾國幣二分，旋漲至七角，後以外匯高漲，紙價　增原因，民國雲南及朝　三家連合通吿，由二十七年十二月一日起，同齊漲　，民國益世及雲南日報訂價，一月國幣一元，半年國幣五元五角，全年國幣壹拾元零五角，零售　份四分。惟朝報獨以篇幅較小，訂價略爲公道，一月國幣七角五分，半年國幣三元八角，全年國幣七元五角，零售每份二分半，外　郵費照　。</p>
<p>至於通信社，本地僅有省黨部所辦之雲南通訊社一家，社址卽在華山南路省黨部內，社長陳廷璧，編輯甘汝棠。所　之稿，除供本地報館採用外，他省各報館，亦有多家訂閱。該社近來招考速記及記者，正謀社務之改進與擴充。走筆至此，忽見中央通信社昆明分社成立廣吿，是　游擊區內之採訪老將，當有不少來滇，雲南通信社記者，切磋問道，不患無所矣。（蕭文虎）</p>
<h3 id="c17">郭沫若講　戰時文化工作　在渝文化界座談會上 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>【重慶通訊】在文化界座談會會室內、擠滿了四五十人、欣欣然地來聽郭沫若先生的演講、</p>
<p>張申府先午主席、簡單地介紹了郭先生過去在文化界上的努力工作、郭先生使滿面笑容地靠近了講台、</p>
<p>幾　客氣話說完、正題便開始、郭先生說、</p>
<p>「文化是有進步性的、是隨着人類的進化而向前發展的、尤其是配合了爲着自由、和平的戰爭、其進步則更加迅連、我們現時的抗戰、誰都知道是爲　人類的正義而戰、也可以說正是防衛文化進步而戰、所以我們的文化、自抗戰以來、是突飛猛進了、在×人那方面呢、無疑地是退步的、因爲他不單以摧毀我國文化建設爲能事、他自己國內的文化、自「九一八」以來、就加　在退步；他們的思想不自由、言論不自由、可以說整個的文化都在白色恐怖之下、以前、他們標榜他們的「大學自由」、而現在「大學自由」已成爲歷史上的名詞了、自去年七月以來、強迫在軍閥鐵蹄之下做奴隸的文人、已將近一萬人了、』</p>
<p>說到這裏，郭先生嘆了一口長氣、深爲世界上有此　礙人類文化的惡魔而憤恨、然而、停了　停、又換了愉快的聲調、</p>
<p>在抗戰以前、我們的文化、彷彿還沒有脫離那一翻譯」狀態、即是　文化與一般實際要求不發生　麼關係、從國外歸來的人、因爲自己所學的東西、不是一般人需要的東西、因而就感到所用非所學的苦悶，文化工作者便一天一天和實際要求成了游離的狀態、可是、自抗戰爆發後、這種的游離已逐漸消滅了、由於實際的要求，許多多少年前就要舉辦的事業、却于人們不知不覺中就完成了、如湘桂路的通車、就是一個最好的例　、』</p>
<p>這種好現象使全室的人興奮起來、然後他便說到『戰時的文化工作者應該作些什麽』的問題、他鄭　地、慢慢地說、</p>
<p>「因　我們抗戰是防衛文化的戰爭、所以我們戰時的文化應該是：在國內方面，怎樣來增强人民抗戰的力量？怎樣使兵士富有同仇敵愾的稱神？在×人方面、怎樣去瓦解×人的兵力、在國際方面、怎樣去爭取　多的援助勢力？』</p>
<p>「在第一期抗戰中、這三方面、我們都獲得了相當的成功」郭先生一一舉出了如全民的團結、如兵士的勇　、如×兵的　戰、如國際對我的日趨好轉等等、這都是文化工作者的力量、</p>
<p>「可是、』郭先生接着　、「在第一期抗戰中、我們的文化還只是由這一個都市而栘到那一個都市、在東北戰場戰爭最激烈的時候、大家就提出「文化人向內移」的口號、一些人由於主觀的努力、　些人由於客　的過促、是做到了、文化人向　移、使戰時文化的開展上有莫人的功效、然而、至現階段爲止、文化人那只還在往都　移、還沒有向廣大的鄕村移動、在以前、文　人多半好高騖遠、不肯接近文化水準低下的老百姓、現在、文化人　然把昂到天外去的那個頭、低下來了、但所作的東西、還未能眞正的一大衆化」。</p>
<p>他很憤慨地說、到現時還有多少人認爲一切作品「大衆化一了、我們的文化就　破產，他認爲這是胡說、因爲不先把一般老百姓　文化水準提高、而只關在屋內叫「提高文化』是沒有用處的、他因此主張、「在第二期抗戰中、文化人要往鄉下移、作品嬰絕對的「大衆化、」接着他又舉出在砍治部第三廳的畫家們的作品、引不起一般民衆的注意、還有新　製的抗戰影片、也　能使老百姓了解、雖然電影和繪畫是取好的宣傳工具、「今後、一切的作品要對的簡明、因爲無識無知的最大多數的老百姓正是我們作戰　主力保衛祖國的壯丁也正是在他們當中去徵發哩、』</p>
<p>「除此以外、文化人還有一個最重要的動向、那就是「文化人要往×後移、」</p>
<p>『第二期的主要戰略是在×人的後方開闢廣大妁游擊區」、</p>
<p>他以五台作　、證明了游擊戰在×人後方的力量、他說如果我們能在×人後方建立和五台二樓的十個游擊區、×人就簡直沒有辦法、據彭德懷先生的報吿、在五台、不單牽制了х人三個帥團的兵力、簡直殲滅了三個師團的х人、」這樣的成功、「他高聲說、『單靠武力打嗎、不行的、除了武力之外、主要的還需要發動民衆、組織民衆、而做這　工作的、便是文化人的責任了、我們的文化人、在目前要實際幫助抗戰、就該多量地向×人後方移去、趕快去建立起强有力的　擊區來，』</p>
<p>他喝了一口茶、想了一想、又說、「我們整個的戰略　是『持久戰　、而「持久戰」要靠充實後力來維持、但如何來充實呢、那就需要大　的各生產種部「的工作人員、所以文化人在此時還有鼓勵靑年學習專門技衛的重要仕務、」</p>
<p>他很痛恨有許多自私自利的敎授、爲了滿足自己物質生活的要　、或怕空襲、便躱在安全區城、他認爲這些人與北平的漢奸相差只是一張紙、所以、他最後大聲呼喊、「我們要救國、先須自己學得救國的本領、不單自己要學習、還須敎一般靑年學　救國的本領、』</p>

<h3 id="c23">羅馬尼亞政治形勢（續） <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>法西斯蒂利用少數民族問題做干涉別國內政的工具和要求別國領土的藉口，照德國戈林所定侵略計劃，第一項就是「從捷克和羅馬尼亞進攻烏克蘭」。明興會議以後，捷克已經淪爲德國的附庸，現法西斯蒂的火焰依次燒到了羅馬尼亞。那面有豐富的物產，如煤油木材，牧羣食糧等，希特勒早就眼望欲穿。他想把羅馬尼亞作爲進攻蘇聯的犧牲品，所以希特勒儼然以羅國少數民挨的保護者自居，開始削弱羅馬尼亞的力量。而卡羅爾竟倒施逆行，不把國內各民族在乎等原則之下團結起來，去保護國家的利益，反而走入歧途，而與國內少數民族爲難，簡直是一種目殺政策。</p>
<p>羅政府的壓迫少數民族是從鎭壓國內工農大衆反對封建的革命怒潮而出發的。目的在乎移轉羣衆的鬥爭目標。戈格內閣成立以後就步德國後塵把猶太人開刀，想叫勞苦大衆之仇恨統治階級者移轉到少數民族身上。卡羅爾實行君主獨裁之後，竟變本加厲，頒布單行法限制他們的權利，并且任命鐵衛團份子法西斯暴徒特辣格魔，爲少數民族委負。</p>
<p>卡羅爾而且異想天開，把全國劃成十區，各置皇家監督一人。區內行政官吏槪由監督任免，任何團體多得向他註冊。監，並且有權把他們解散。白賽賴比亞區的監督就是一個著名的法西斯蒂主義者。其他各監督雖無黨派背景，也都非常反動。</p>
<p>排猶運動</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的土地大部屬於祖籍希臘的安產階級。整個農村在封建勢力籠罩之下。農民們爲了節省食鹽，把吃剩的菜湯留下來下次煮榮，不肯丟掉。生活苦况于此可見。文化水凖很低。文盲允塞。而且非常迷信，易於受騙。農民不堪政府苛捐什稅和地主的剝削，階級仇愼日益加深，統治者爲避免革命起見，於是提倡排猶運動去轉變農民的鬬爭方向。</p>
<p>猶太人在羅馬尼亞總計有八十五萬左右。占全國人口百分之五。歷史很久，遠在耶穌時代就有猶太移民，到十八世紀人數逐漸加多，特別在歐戰期中及歐戰以後大批猶太人都移居羅馬尼亞。他捫的生活習慣，語言，文字種種早已同化。特別是一四九四年從西班牙移殖來的簡直什麽都同化了。猶太人在羅馬尼亞的經濟發　上很有貢織，因此在蠱工商界占着重要地位。</p>
<p>照一九一九年十二月九日，英美法意日與羅馬尼亞所簽訂的「保障少數民族條約」第八條規定，『韓國人民不分種族語言或宗敎一律平等。』第七條規定「居住羅國之猶太人除已有其他國籍者外，一律應認爲羅國人民。」羅馬尼亞並答應，如果違背該約規定，國聯會員可以提出警吿。由國聯行政院加以適當處置。——可是戈格執政之後，就首倡排猶運動。</p>
<p>戈格政府規定凡一九二二年以後入籍的猶太人一律取銷公民權，不得保有土地或經售政府專利的商品，如酒，烟，火柴等物，並且不得担任報館編輯。</p>
<p>羅京的法西黨徒以豐色大廈爲大本營，結隊游行，招搖過市，　到貌似猶太人的就隨便侮辱，甚至綁進聲色大廈，私刑吊打。「狄明納泰」報的主筆勃魯孟菲道博士因爲主張公道，結果給法西期暴徒架走，就關在這所房于裏幾乎給他們打死。</p>

<p>— （本報上海特約通訊）　致平</p>
<p>協定成立後之情形</p>
<p>一，日貨輸入　登首位。自戰事發生以來，對外貿易，甚受影響，自後又逐漸恢復。以上海一埠而論，二十七年度六月份日貨輸入只値二十萬元，卑不足道，七月份躍至四百餘萬元，八月份爲三百餘萬元，九月份爲四百餘萬元，十月份爲五百餘萬元，躍登輸入首位矣。至在虹口出入之貨物，是否全行完稅，尙是疑問。</p>
<p>再就全國結論，輸入貨物，一月份美國第一，爲一一，五六九元，日本第八，爲二，四四〇元；二月份美國第一，爲一八，〇二四元，日本第五·爲六，〇二三元；三月份德國第一，爲一九，〇六二元，日本第五，爲一〇，二二七元；四月份美國第一，爲一三。二四五元，日本第二，爲一〇，二四〇元；五月份日本第一，爲一五，三六一元；六月份日本第一，爲一八，三七二元；七月份日本第一，爲一九，七〇一元；八月份日本第一，爲二三，八二五元；九月份日本爲一，爲二四，七五五元；十月份日本第一，爲二〇，六二五元（以上單位千元）。</p>
<p>二，私貨入口仍然充斥。自海關協定成立後，私貨愉漏，本可望其减少，然據報載，呢絨，嗶嘰，人造絲，豆餅，火柴，魚罐頭日用品等項，仍大量私運入口，因不納關稅，售價常較市價减三分之一以上，正當商業頗受影響云云，又據十月八日報載，江海關雖恢復滬東區緝私工作，但常受軍事性質之阻撓，致未能嚴厲執行，走私漏稅之風，迄仍猖獗，最近一星期內私貨進口以食米，白糖，鹽等日用食品爲大宗，深望各界商號，勿進來歷不明之貨云云。綜上所述，可知私貨入口，仍極充斥也，</p>
<p>三，海關被迫懸掛廢旗協定談判期間，縣幟問題爲一大結，關係方面曾一度表示海關此後將不懸掛任何旗幟爲一種消極的折衷辦法，乃至十一月四日，據云係受僞組織僞員之命令，五色旗廢幟，竟高懸於江海關大廈屋頂，及巡行黃浦江內之各海關船隻上，見者側目，輿論譁然，紛向海關負責當局質詢。斯後廢幟又數度懸掛，據總稅務司梅樂和向外界表示，對懸掛廢幟，未接報吿，（？）及已向中央方面呈報請示云。</p>
<p>與乂謀皮之失敗</p>
<p>關於海關協定，有以爲戰時期之一種不得已暫行辦法，苟不然者，武力刦奪之舉，恐或不免。整個關權，胥將墜入他人手中，予取予求，而藉關收爲担保之各項外債本息，亦將無撥付保障。故當海關協定成立之際。內外輿論，除對此表示扼腕，及申言中國將保留自由行動權外，他少論列。然有應注意者：協定成立之動機固爲防私，而迄後走私如故，迄未稍殺，此其一：英人原希望以協定緩和日本對英在華商業利益之壓迫，而無如長江開放仍然拒絕，在華利益反以處處忍讓、損害更甚，此其二：關收除撥付外債與賠欵外所餘甚鉅，存放於正金銀行，不無奪×以糧，爲日僞雙方所利用，外報肥者曾於前日叩問日方發言人，「維新政府」曾由關稅項下提欵或借用欵項，而以關稅爲抵，日方亦避不作答，此其三。抑有進者，外債之價付，所以維持我對外信用，但自津滬粤三關相繼淪陷，其權已不在我。外報記者亦以此詢諸日方發言人有無將存於正金銀行之關餘，付於以關稅作抵之外債，日人只以調劑相推託。凡此當爲英人始料所不及。然而事變之來，對於日商亦作萬分之讓步，滬海關允日本郵船會社之謂，得用日文提貨單，並塡發日文貨目單，此種增例，以一國之海關提單，准甩洋文，原非正常，而乃英日各國文字紛然雜作，此則更匪伊所思。重現實無遠謀之央政治家，與虎謀皮能望其遠東利益之能保持乎，</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3 id="c33">日外相有田演詞 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>日外相有田於昨日議會發表演說，說明日本今後外交政策，重要的是：（一）日本決貫澈具結成『日滿支集團』，樹立「東亞新秩序」的政策，他在這裏充分地說明了日本外交是日本軍閥的工具，今後政策也就是日本軍閥意旨的表現。所謂『希望中國迅速成立新中央政府』，也就是以外交陰謀爲輔，以促成軍閥意圖中的僞滿第二的新中國的出現。（二）他又聲明日本仍决開放中國鬥戶，但與國防有關事項，日本有施行相當限制之必要。這又說明了日本對英美等國的立意欺誘，但是所謂相當限制究無具體界限，而在日本特准下的『門戶開放』的狹窄更可想像，英美雖倦於反抗，但至少不會愚至甘心爲此誘餌而爲日本侵略者服務以助長其聲勢之理。（三）他又聲明：「日本對於蘇聯及法國之援華事實，不能默而息，對於安南之成爲中國從國外取得軍火之門戶一事，更將採取對策，以報復之。這更是對於法蘇兩國的無理恫嚇，而與德國的東進　國的反法，有桴鼓相應之意，可惜這種恫嚇已經太遲，蘇聯旣不畏懼恫嚇，中國更不同捷克！此外有田還不厭不倦的高呼赤化危機，大唱亞瀕反共，幾乎忘記了他們自己最近屈膝於張鼓峯紅旗之下這件騰笑天下的大事！總之，有田宣言外不足以使列强稍感興趣，內更徒增國人厭倦，我們無以名之，名之曰『自欺欺人』！</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>抗戰的全面敎育　在中華藝術協進會幹部訓練班</p>
<p>雖然是一個朔風凜冽的寒夜，求知若渴的一羣靑年的內心却像烈火燃燒一般，披上笨重的冬衣，踴踴躍躍地走過麥凄冷冷的馬路，踏進充滿着暖氣的中華藝術協進會幹部訓練班來恥敎陶行知先生的講演。</p>
<p>偌大的一個敎室已吿滿座，陶先生在掌聲雷動之後就很從容地，很安詳地開始他的說話：</p>
<p>『今天是香港中華藝術協進會幹部訓練班開學的日千；兄弟得來參加這個盛會是覺得十二分高興的。剛才看到你們所要探討的許多重要問題，亦使得找非常欣慰。現在，我所要講的題目，就是你們所約定的「戰時敎育」這一個問題。』</p>
<p>陶先生作了一個小引之後，就談到本題來了：</p>
<p>『抗戰發生以後，還有人是不承認「戰時敎育」的。當兄弟在海外的時侯，就聽到某大學校長大發其「高論」，說甚麽戰時敎育沒有念過，不知怎樣去辦。接着，就是拿「百年大計」的招牌出來掩護。</p>
<p>其實，這是淺而易見的：現在日本帝國主義已經將中國造成戰時的中國了。我們一切的生活與活動都應該適合戰時的需要，誰亦不能躱避，敎育亦當然不能例外。</p>
<p>某校長不辦戰時敎育，不研究戰時敎育，就得辭職，否則坐吃國家的薪俸。實在是很笑話的！</p>
<p>兄弟很不贊成他的意思，所以寫了一首詩來答復他：</p>
<p>『遍地發瘟，</p>
<p>媽媽病倒在床。</p>
<p>叫他倒口開水，他說功課忙。</p>
<p>叫他，請醫生，他說功課忙。</p>
<p>叫他去買一服藥，他說功課忙。</p>
<p>等到媽媽死了，</p>
<p>他寫訃文忙；</p>
<p>寫祭文忙；</p>
<p>做孤哀子忙。』</p>
<p>引得全場轟然大笑。陶先生嫉惡如仇地再說：</p>
<p>『時到現在，還有人是這樣爲敎育而敎育，敎員是敎死書，死敎齊，敎書死。學生是讀死書，死讀書，讀書死。</p>
<p>——又是一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>『他們幹着平時教育，就是在「百年大計」招牌之下過其超然的生活。我們大家的媽媽——中華民族是怎樣的創痛危殆，他是不管的。直至媽媽死了，他倒亦會忙於做訃文，忙於做　哀千。</p>
<p>陶先生痛斥反面的「平時敎育」之後，就掉上正面的本起來了：</p>
<p>『第二期的抗戰是全面抗戰，對于敎育的要求就是全面敎育。全面敎育的意思，就是說，要將敎育展開到我們的前方與×人的後方，以至於整個的世界，使全世界都覺醒起來擴大反侵略運動。這是就空間而論。就對象而言，敎育並不是少數少爺小姐們，有錢，有閒，有面子者的專利品。而是應該把敎育展開到全部的靑年去，全部的見童，全部的壯年，全部的老人，連全部的老太婆都在內。</p>
<p>亦許有人要說：小孩子與老太婆有什麽用呢？其實，小孩子要是像台兒莊的孩子唱歌團把那個姓黃的小漢奸變成小戰士一樣——那姓黃的小孩中了×人的　騙，做了小漢奸之後，因爲受兒童宣傳隊所感動就舉手懺悔做漢奸的經過。並向我軍報吿×情，結果，炸燬了×人的火藥庫，槍械等等，從小漢奸而變小戰士了——老太婆則能够像趙老太太二樣，抗戰的力量不知道要增加多少倍呢。所以，敎育要展開到小孩和老太婆的隊伍裏去，展開到整個民族去。</p>
<p>陶先生講到了這個段落，稍一停頓之後，接着還是很起勁地談全面敎育，應該一樣辦：</p>
<p>『凡是戰時所發生的集團，敎育就要展開到那裏去。</p>
<p>戰時有了傷兵，敎育就要到傷兵那裏去。有了五百個傷兵病院，就要當作五百個傷兵學校辦。傷兵沒得敎育，惡劣的影響是不堪設想的。傷兵得到了敎育，所發生的力量，是非常宏大的，他們在　方可以　響民氣，在前方可以影響士氣，這是淺而易見的這理。</p>
<p>戰時有了難民，敎育就要到難民那裏去，使得消耗的賑濟，成爲生產的力量。戰時要徵兵，敎育就要到壯丁的隊伍裏去。使所有的壯丁都踴躍服兵役，踴躍從軍，把我們的兵源弄成取之無盡用之無窮，這亦是很要　的問理。</p>
<p>不僅如此，我們還要把敎育開展到×人的後方。使僞政權不得成立，日本的反戰運動强化起來，展開到全世界去，使國際上的援助益趨積。』</p>

<p>— 譚友一</p>
<p>近來的電影市面好像民間故事快將絕跡；單是出一回浴與『刁刁眼角』的浪漫肉感片，以及「扮猪嚇　虎」似的恐怖作品都不見得風行，於是乎一部份像然。聰明的影人搔搔屁股，計上心來而以什麽「笑死人，無命棓」的喜劇爲號召了。其實一部影片之能否賣座，換句話說就是能否邀得多嗷觀衆，完全是屬於它的本質問題，而與它的形式無關的，內容空洞，粗報濫造的東西，無論你怎樣宣傳，最多只能欺騙觀衆一時，至於那些違背了時代精神，或是散播着削弱抗戰力的是毒素片，當然更要受人唾罵及摒棄！反之一部意識正確，技藝成熟的作，無論它是悲劇或是喜劇，無論是言情的或是偵探的，將同樣地被歡迎，决沒有『過了市面』的顧慮，戲院的座客是最和善的主顧，他們只需要好的東西，根本上幷沒有什麽時候應該有那一種戲的成見。若是你能够再進一步採取和他（她）們有切身關係的題材而且是通過了藝術和技巧的孕育，那便是『無往而不利』的「不二法門」，他，她）們絕對不會有指足要用那種戲劇方式來表現綫合意的苛求的。所謂「從前要那樣，現在看客要的見解簡直是『擁　頭打啐了鏡子』，看不見自己的短處而已。話應該說到題上來。我們姑且承認一目前的電影市塲將爲喜劇所佔有』這一個錯覺，來談談喜劇，藉爲製作者和愛好者增加一點子參考。</p>
<p>喜劇，照字面上的釋義是引人發笑的戲劇，然而因爲它是屬於戲劇的，是文學的一部門，尤其是電影　認爲綜合的藝術，則喜劇的成就回不應該「純以引人發笑為能事」那麽簡單，我們應該賦予以生命和更大的效果，使看戲的羣衆其情感幷不止於笑笑的限域。這里簡略地　列着喜劇的分　：</p>
<p>喜劇Slad—Stick　Comedy這是談不到有生命和更大效果的喜劇，是喜劇中最下乘的出品。情節可以瞎串，笑料可以便凑，無所謂意識，不必計內容，幾乎其唐，混哉也賬一聽尊便。只要你以爲『男人懷孕』，『烏龜生翼』是最朴的故祟，不防儘地取材！「裾拉褲」，「鬼五馬六」是空前笑料，只管大量穿挿，反正具作用只要故意強迫觀者看時發笑，無須合乎物理人情，不計較其有無回味或是印象怎樣：當然也不理會到有識者與較進步的觀衆的厭惡和唾罵，西片羅路哈地，麥氏兄弟等作品是這一流喜劇的正宗。國片的所謂「喜劇　」者多數走着這一條淺薄無聊的路綫。</p>
<p>輕鬆喜劇Light　Comedy是屬於中乘的喜劇。它需要一個較完整的故事，但常是空想的，也需要合理的笑料，糢糊地有一點生命的影子，效果也在笑笑之中還好像多了一些東西。編，導，演諸色人等對這一類製作必須極力賣弄其聰明，專從小地方發揮其幽默與機智，　以搔着觀衆的癢處使看時有　鬆愉快之感爲目的。美國出　最擅畏這種作風而魯必治允稱此道聖手。</p>
<p>諷刺喜劇Sat　ric　Cmedy這纔是上乘的喜劇，有骨有肉而且有着特　效果的喜劇。也許其情節的浮面上不一定近乎人情，但它必定針對着社會或人生某一種抑多種的行止而加以尖銳的，誇張的，毫不寬容的諷刺。其演出雖是用着喜劇的形式，但其效果却能予觀衆以意外的警　而留下深刻的印象，卽使被諷刺者在座也要爲之失笑，直到恍然大之後復感到如芒之在背。這一類喜劇　容易從頭到尾一氣呵成，差利卓別　在他的作品內常常滲納有一部分或大部份的諷刺材料，而法蘭卡勃拉Frank　Carra導演的『富貴浮雲』已做到十份之八的成功。完整的，筆者只看過一部蘇聯的出品『傀儡』The　Maionelte。</p>
<p>介乎中上乘之間我們還可以發現一種悲喜劇Tragic　Comedy。這定名似乎很矛盾，可是其成功爲中上或是上乘害劇的緣因就在它的矛盾。悲劇令你流淚不足爲奇，若是喜劇而令亦感戴那纔偉大。差利卓別靈之所以至今雄踞喜劇寶座，擁有最多衆者，就是因爲他多數的作品都是悲劇的內容而用喜劇演出。遠如默片　代之「從軍夢」，「尋子遇仙」，近如「城市之光」，「摩登時代』無一不是酸辛的，現實的故事而以詼諧表現出來。他讓你笑，仰天人笑，然而你若又是麻木不仁而在笑後能够囘味一吓的話，你沒有不憐憫那劇中窮漢的遭遇，甚至爲他一掬同情之淚的。如此其效果及印象當然比較直接的悲劇來得曲折而且有力，而其生命豈不是比較其他一些浮面由的喜劇更為潑刺活躍嗎？</p>
<p>這里所　提供關於喜劇的漫　只有這麽貧弱的一點，然而還勉强可算得『麻雀雖小五臟全俱下』希。望對喜劇發生興趣的影人及觀們從這一小點上加以擴視而决定其製作及欣想的態度，務求其無負於資力的運用及時間的磨。</p>
<p>「新官上任」的警察局長偷鷄　（時代劇團在澳演出）</p>
<p>「新官上任」精彩的一幕劉　：「老子要娶你」！</p>
<h3 id="c48">「新官上任」與「得意忘形」 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 范嘉</p>
<p>時代劇團與中華藝術劇團之演出</p>
<p>劇詊</p>
<p>在兩個月以前，有一個劇本被香港劇團所注意了，同時被排演了，就是中華藝術劇團的『得意忘形』，與時代劇團的『新官上任』。名字雖然不同。其實是同一劇本，中藝以國語演的，時代以粤語演的。中藝與時代同片香港劇運中心團體，同時又是由默陽予倩先生導演的，演出的成績，當然可以相信是靠得住的。</p>
<p>時代的『新官上任』，在本以中旬，赴澳義，中於十五日作首次演出，筆者已經着過了，中　的『得意忘形』又於本月十五日在香港中央戲院上演了，筆也者都看過。要是把兩個演出，拉攏在一塊談談，我想是很有意思的。</p>
<p>劇本是戲劇的靈魂，有了靈魂，再加上排列的手段（導演）才產生有血有肉的軀體。以同一的劇本，再經過同一的導演處理，該有同樣的東西出現，這是當然的吧。可是奇妙得很，我　過這兩個演出，却給我不同的感覺，不同樣的趣味。中藝的「得意忘形」是沉重的靜默的，時代的『新宣上任』是輕鬆的，流動的。前者較接近於　劇，後者是喜劇兩者的演出法相同，舞台面的構成，演員的位置，也無大的出入，而演出的作風有這樣的差別，大槪是中這兩個團體，有不同的風格吧。</p>
<p>本來，這劇是暴露一批流氓地痞之流偶然在某一個會機得志了的種種醜態，而同時又表現了在黑暗勢力下的老百姓家破人亡的慘痛，前半部是喜劇，後半部是悲劇、形成了很嚴重的對照。這對照越有力，効果越大。如果把喜劇的地方，演得沉重，把悲劇的演得輕浮。都是失敗的。『得意忘形』的</p>
<p>第一二兩幕，就是犯了沉重靜默的錯誤，演員們旣沒有充分的表現出『得意』的地方，也未表現出「忘形」的神態，　臺裝置方面，用線條整潔的布景，以黃色爲基調的燈光，彼此配部台起來。更加使前半部于和平寧靜的氣象裏，以這樣的姿態，來表演這醜類的一羣，無疑地是不够的。一新官上任」的前半都演得非常輕鬆熱閙，多用誇張的動作，加濃了喜劇的成份，使人感覺到這批新貴的人們之可笑亦復可憐。在兩個演出看來，「新上官任一比較成功了，觀衆的反應較大，而又能衷現出劇本的原意。</p>
<p>前半郎是喜劇，後半部是悲劇的戲，是最難　的。弄得不好，很容易　成兩段不聯接的東西，有經驗的演員，最懂得留神這地方，「得意忘　」的後半部是跟着前半部連續下去，保待了沉重靜默的空氣，因此第三幕的效果很好，不過略嫌冗長而已，這責任應由劇作者負之，與以出者無涉。中藝的演技，演穩定見長，第三慕這民的劇，最適合於表演的。可惜去小銀弟的童小姐，並未得見所長，這是美中不足的地方。『新官上任的後半部也是跟前半部　氣分發展下去的，因此略爲流動』不過這樣也有好處，我記得演到第三慕的時候，有不少觀衆被感動到流淚了，我動流淚了，也許是由於徐家父女的慘痛，　觸動教家人毀亡的　心吧。</p>
<p>這兩個演出的不同，固然是由於各個團體的風格不同，同時我覺得方言的同不也是個重要原因，廣東人不及外省人馴謹，而外省人不及廣東人的活潑，說通俗一點，就是沒有廣東人一樣『　惑『。演喜劇以廣東人較適宜，比如象『油漆未乾』之類的戲，北方人就不及　東人演得活。廣東人俗語的奧妙處，有許多是國語所沒有的，尤其是下層社會的，如這個戲的劇詞裏常用的『他媽的』這句話，就遠不及「×那媽」這樣爽快乾能，『新官上任』裏面常用下層社會的俗語很多，旣流利，又自然，正適合於那一批升官得意的地，的性格，新官上任之得到好的効應，這是很大的原因。</p>

<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>二　戲劇演出的組織者　一，導演者的任務</p>
<p>以前有張片子叫「四十二街」的，寫一個導演，辛辛苦苦地排練成一個戲，到演出之日，果然獲得了空前的成功：可是當地坐在門口，聽着觀衆們的批評，只是讚賞演員，却把導演完全忘掉了，他很悲哀！</p>
<p>對了，這就是導演的悲哀，當戲劇完成它的排練過程而在舞台演出的時候，藝術家與欣賞藝術的社會層之間所在的直接速絡，導演是沒有份的。</p>
<p>當戲劇藝術在舞台上進行最完整最具體的創作的時候，雖然導演者是被擯棄了，可是這一個完整的創作，可以說就是導演者的心血。</p>
<p>戲劇藝術是綜合的藝術，而把各部門獨立，藝術綜合，有機地統一組織起來的人，也就是導演的任務，所以說導　就是戲劇演出的組織者。</p>
<p>因此，作爲一個導演者，他不僅要有文學的修養，藉以理解劇本，同時他還曉得美術，舞台裝置，演技理論，音樂，舞踏……一切舞台技術；因爲導演不僅是個戲劇演出的組織者，同時又是個集團，作的指揮者，就跟一個樂隊的指揮一樣。</p>
<p>一個戲劇演出上的成功，最要緊的是整齊完美，所以戲劇藝術創作，應當統一在一個意志，一個目的之下來進行，而導演者的最大的任務，，就是站在劇作家和劇場的創作集團之間，來統一集團全體人員的創作意志。所謂導演技術，就是連結劇作家的藝術和演員的表演，而給與限制的；導演向演員及其他藝術家們解釋劇作家所給與的主題和形象的體系；導演的創作村料：是演員，作曲家，裝置家，……等的藝術，戲劇創作上整想的企圖，戲劇演出的的計劃和形式等，大部份是導演的力量。</p>
<p>由此看起來，戲劇藝術就好像只是導演一人的自我表現而已，不過這觀點是錯誤的。導演並非藉戲劇以表現一已創作的個性而是提出生活上的重要問題來解決——這就是戲劇的使命。而　問題的解決。個集團同樣負有責任，各演員，各部門的藝術家應當儘量發揮自己創作意志的獨立性。戲刺央不是導演拿來誇示聰明的工具，導演的藝術要是超出了戲劇之外，而壓迫着其他藝術家們的創作意志時，戲劇就不存在，我們就只接觸到戲劇的要素之一，孤立的導演底藝術而已。而且爲了要遷就導演一個人的私見而犧牲許多的意見，並且强迫其事的藝術家們從事幷自發的藝術創作，是違反了藝術創作的原則，使創作成爲不可能的。所以，導演者的工作，他的責任，不是强迫集團從屬於自己，使之成爲無生命，失掉了創作意志的工具，而是給劇場中一切創作方以靈感。把他們組織起來，鼓動他們之問最大的創作意志和熱情，以完成戲劇藝術之整個的完美的創作。</p>
<p>戲劇藝術可以說是多樣的統一而導者最大的任務，並不是使一切從屬於自己，而是把這多樣的各自具有獨立性的藝術部門，各藝術家的創作意志，集納起來，而以藝術的手段加以調整，批判。衡量，綜合組　起來，使成爲一個總的目標，一個統的意志，一個有機的整體，一個大的創作。導演的任務即在乎此，不得看出，亦不得不足。要能够做到這一步，則戲劇演出之整個完美的成功，是毫無疑問的。（未完）</p>

<p>始終維持　外匯法價</p>
<p>爲使外匯穩定起見、中中交三行始終維持法定價格、雖經日方一再企圖搗亂、如聯鈔之套取外匯、減低華北幣値等、結果一切計、均吿失敗、華化法幣發行、有增無减、得人民之信仰、　然流通、且有升水、　於公開市喝之匯價、迄今始終站　八辦士零、一般人對我國貨幣之信心、業已完全恢復、外匯之近遠差價、由此亦漸泯　、我國　資本、多有將其投於外匯之資金復收囘之、此半恐匯價總漲、失其圖利機會、半以投　資金、實有較外匯更有利之處所在、</p>

<h3 id="c56">今天足球大戰　麗華杯華聯出師　與海軍聯隊交鋒香港會場 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】足球好戲、本屆持多、今天是懷華杯初賽第二幕、華聯對海聯、兩班名角、技術超羣、屆時落力拍演、定然顚倒球國衆生、</p>
<p>華聯爲適應總會利的需求、一選再選而後决定陣綫、李惠堂亦應邀而出、勉强登出、很惠堂足部創處尙未全愈、又因受創後停止運動半月、體量加重、此囘爲和緩總會對南華爽約的不滿而効勞、是熱情作用、未暇他顧、所以在他本人亦未敢自信屆時的演出能否如意、</p>
<p>依我看來、華聯這個陣綫、以對付海聯、堪稱工力悉敵、必殺得難解難分、勝負未可預料、若　斷華聯必敗、未免滅自己威風、若必謂華聯得勝、又不能如此肯定、總而言之、戰後事實便分明、</p>
<p>聽說宋麗聖足傷還未痊可、將不登塲、若然眞的、應以劉始讀補上、至於羅偉權的職守、則無論何如、不可調動，同時希望那幾位初臨大戰的球人、放胆打去、切莫怯場、</p>
<p>又聽說侯澄滔　下亦有毛病、若然他也缺席、前線會受相當影響、那末不得已而求其次、黃景聰是個替補人材</p>
<p>兵法云、「懸　而動、先知迂直之計者勝、」足球之戲、與軍爭之法相同、尤其今天的華聯、對於戰略、更須講求、第一點宜細察對方之質實、出其所必趨、趨其所不意、此之謂權機先握也、第二點宜策應已軍之便利、審察而行動、見機而進退、此之謂量敵制勝也、</p>
<p>有惠堂担任中鋒、便須採用「錐形突擊」法、但必得左右兩內鋒、隨時給予惠堂以充份接濟、又能利用兩翼旁敲、引進對方守將、使他們不得再集合力量、而對此錐形突擊施以側擊、那才易於牧效、</p>
<p>陳炳土對於短切一道、須加注意、斷不是徒然把球傳中、便算了事、而短切及傳中亦須及時、否則徒勞無功、故我的主張、炳士方面、宜多乘勢急攻、澄滔方面、宜多誘敵智取、雖　戰略不是一定的、還須臨機應變、然爲使惠堂錐形突擊易於進展起見、不妨常以旁敲誘敵服制其對中側擊、乃是上策、</p>
<p>這次華聯加强前衞綫、乃係選拔委員們的獨到之見、而今天華聯的勝負問題、亦令視前衛三人表　如何而定、如果靈聖不缺席、此綫堅强、定然退進有據、然即使靈聖不出而　以始讚、亦無　大體、目信得過、此綫淮可發揮攻力、退可袖助後方、</p>
<p>侯容生與偉權、所負鞏銜責任、固然重大、但總要釘件海聯兩翼爲要緊、而三前衞互相　抄的聯繫、亦爲當然的責任、所以兼顧內衞、乃他們在此役最重要的工作、</p>
<p>海聯諸　擅短傳而快捷、兩冀尤兇，而其防守力　、亦屬不弱、故如何制勝、端在　聯健兒努力、</p>
<p>再寄語　迷，欲看好戲、請早到場、但敬吿一聲、莫携帶小意「楷　」、並不可在門外買受兜售圖利的門票、而每一看客亦不得購票逾三張以外、如座位吿滿、即停止售票、戰地是香港會塲、下午三時半開賽、兩軍陣線如下、（球場太歲）</p>

<p>【本報特訊】昨日足球比賽、因麗華杯西文員戰陸軍聯之影響、原定秩序多數改期、甲組聯賽僅得一場舉行、光華初戰聖約瑟、鏖戰結果、光華吿　、昨日之役、因兩隊對錦標均吿絕望、勝負不足以搖動大局、聖隊之敗、乃屬表演失常、該隊進攻力本在于兩翼、惟昨被光華後衞制肘、寸步難移、無機將球斬中、李安納　勇、未能得接濟、遂至英雄無用武之地、後防五　、打來頗肯賣力、惜聯絡欠嚴密、諸將舉動遲緩、故無法阻擋敵鋒、光華方面、文治石金演出作妙、居功最偉、前　重用兩翼、不輕將球滯留、遂使若瑟後衞難於應付、石金所勝兩球、是乘蘇沙錯誤乘機切入建功、後衛以容生演出較作、英明果斷、救險不少、國祺守關、球藝日進千里、將來可成大器、茲略紀戰情如后、</p>
<p>時屆開賽、安納中路領導兩翼推進、甫抵三閘、即爲輝林勾釦、順水推舟、再送一程、光華龍鬥被圍、初鳴警報、幸得容生勇冠三軍、突破重關、殺開血路、石金乘機反擊、錢鄒兩輸，左右扶持、短傳直進、蘇沙攔途擋駕、重門深餿、此路不通、景聰改從邊關進窺、略盤數步、將球斬送中場、皮球去勢低而急速、文治早已靜伏、絕不游疑、對門發矢、馬葵士面對紅日、視察不明、搶救不及、意外先遭失守、此球之作、距開場時間不過五分鐘、可謂神速之至、中圈再來、聖隊雖受暗算、幷不氣餒、竭力反襲、以圖雲恥、於是彼來此往、苦戰不休，子祥監視安納、未免鬆弛、中路屢被突破、弄成腹地滿城風雨、草木皆兵、無何安納遠傳、窩地閃進、迎門舉足猛蹴、斯　光華後路空、僅得國祺獨力鎭守、形勢已頻　境、球迷多料光華難洮刦數、幸國琪知機、棄勢搶險、出　時恰與來球撞　滿懷、反將皮球彈囘場中、逃過大難、此球不入、誠聖隊之不幸、以後光華佔儘優勢、卓鄒兩將三度發矢、惜操之過急、越門寸許落荒出野、失去必勝良機、上半塲終、光華僅以一比零佔先</p>
<p>易陣後、戰情漸趨劇烈、聖隊以出師無功、全軍奮起精神、勇往直前、中鋒李安納、自領一軍、直搗黃龍勢如破竹、光華陣地動搖、局勢垂　、侯子奮不顧身、以背擋去安納鐵彈。死裏逃生，光華危局旣解、前　再舉急攻、文治三刀兩斧、直撲對方、熾芬橫衝直撥、蹂躪敵營、夏仙祗顧左方、不防石金奇兵突出、從後掩至偃旗息鼓、搶去寶貝、送之網內、再建一功、聖隊連失兩城、　有不甘、奮力追擊加土地絡沿邊切入、輝林攔截、大意犯規、罰球由瑟若高送門前、落點美妙、金氏於人叢中急施冷矢、對門歸射、國祺卻來弗及、爲其打破光蛋紀綠、雙方繼續掙扎、中場混戰各有攻守、聖隊曾一度佔盡上風、惜前條射鬥之術、好作無的放矢間有機緣、又爲國祺拾去、久攻不逞、前線旣不能進、後防遂成多事之秋、腹地被圍、水洩不通、熾芬乘景聰交來妙球　迎門猛蹴、但　馬葵士擋出、金石眼明脚快、加上一脚、又中紅心、成三比一之局、以後光華攻勢更盛、石　虎虎迫人、德榮救球心切、與之打個照面、換撞傷其手筋、輾轉呻吟、離塲救治、片刻復出、直戰至終場、各無建樹、結果光華會以三比一勝聖約瑟、陣勢如下、</p>

<p>娛樂…郡主與侍者</p>
<p>Baroness　and　the　Buller</p>
<p>本是出名的舞台喜劇、現在改編電影、故事本身有着濃厚的喜劇趣味、更加上幽默明星威廉飽惠爾、和安娜蓓拉賣力的　作、使本片成爲一部極優秀極成功的作品、</p>
<p>威廉鮑惠爾飾一侍者、是某伯爵家中最能幹的僕人、對於家務各項、都處理得井井有條、伯爵全家對他皆極滿意、但事情出人意表的、這侍者竟暗中從事政治活動、而被選作議會議員、幷且是站在與主子敵對的黨派方面、在職業上他是一個矢忠主　的僕人、而在政治方面、却大發政論、無微不至的攻擊他的主子、那伯爵還算心胸寬闊、對他還有相的的諒解、最不服氣的還是伯爵的女公主、一個標準的貴族小姐（安娜蓓拉飾）、而在這糾紛矛盾的情形之下、鬧出了連篇的笑話、</p>
<p>片中有極美妙的對白、幽默詼諧中含有眞理、威廉飽惠爾的作風沒有改變、沉着鎭定之中、自有令人絕倒之處、安娜蓓拉在這部片中、還算是第一次在美國製的影片中出現、她也有極優秀的演出、</p>
<p>皇后……彩片精華</p>
<p>華脫狄斯奈、所監製的鋼筆畫片、是受每一個觀衆的讚實與歡迎的、特別是在他『雪姑七友』大胆嘗試的成功之後、更受一般愛好電影的觀衆們大大的注意、一場『彩片精華』的放映、都是選擇集合他最近的作品、片共十本、片名列下、</p>
<p>『獵狐記』、『怪鸚鵡』、『家畜交響曲』、「打球笑話」、『水晶宮王子』「銀星童詰」「捕鯨記」「幸運之日」『不鬬之牛』「巨人記」</p>
<p>各片的繪畫技術、以及色調音調的配合、皆是儘美　善、故事的取材簡短活潑、幷充滿着濃厚的趣味、除米基老鼠和唐納鴨之外、尙有新的創作、其中「不　之牛」、「水晶　王子、「銀　童話」、「巨人記」四部尤爲出色之作、</p>
<p>平安……摩登女探</p>
<p>The　Mad　Manton</p>
<p>一部融合着羅曼絲和神秘暗殺案、而以諧趣瘋狂的格調演出的影片、白蓓蘭史丹妃飾一壞透了的交際花、無意中發現一尸首、報吿警署、及到偵緝趕到、死尸已給兇手搬走了、因她平素的品行，人家以爲是她想出風頭而造出的一憫謊話、這分明是寃枉了她、更使她吃不消的還是一憫靑年的編輯（亨利方達飾）、在報上對她冷議熱嘲的　擊、於是糾合了一班姊妹、進行偵緝的工作、在發現第二死屍之後、人家才同情相信她、特別是那靑年編緝、給她大大的帮忙、那時候兇手想殺她以減口、虧得警探把兇手圍殲、方得幸免、片中情節略缺可能性、但因谷演員優秀的演作、遂使劇情的開展、自然輕鬆、暗殺案的編排也相當曲折但在片中幷未佔重要之地位、因爲本片藉以引人入勝者、不是緊張嚴重的偵探故事、而是濃厚的喜劇趣味、</p>
<p>東方……同共歌舞</p>
<p>Everybody　Sing</p>
<p>裘蒂珈倫主演、地的歌喉雖然不及狄安娜寶萍來得動人、可也新人中極出的人才了、寫一个戲劇狂的家庭所以、一切都是徧重在喜劇與歌舞方面、是一般好萊塢歌舞片的彩色、她不祗會出歌、而表情也不差、亞倫瓊斯沒有像「情韻動軍心」裏那樣出色、</p>
<p>大華……頑童小傳</p>
<p>The　Adventure　of　Tom　Sawyer</p>
<p>是一部很優容的文藝影片、就是根據馬克吐溫的厚著改編的、全片雖然很長、但導演處理得宜、那種輕快生動的稿子、使我們並不覺得沉悶、一部份　因爲一輩童角出色的表演、尤其是兩個主角、飾姑母的梅羅遜演出亦很好、彩色的攝製、更增加了本片的價値、</p>
<p>景星……西行記</p>
<p>Way　Out　West</p>
<p>新世界……正一多情種</p>
<p>許　麗、和鄺山笑主演</p>
<p>中央……珍珠衫</p>
<p>好萊塢的陳査禮逝世才不久，中國電影界便有凍査禮的產生、這種投機的手段、沈無須耗費宣傳之勞、而能坐收號之效、中國　片家的聰明、於此可見一班、但本片內容故事的編　未能盡音、同時各緊張塲面、也皆未能儘量發揮、對於盜匪輩的行爲動作的描寫、失敗多於成功、演員之支配也不甚適合、除劉瓊有相當成就之外、顧蘭君和洪警鈴沒甚戲做、徐莘園的陳査禮。面部化裝頗能近似、但動作方面的摹仿則尙未談得、</p>

<h3 id="c65">「澈底」的問 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 竟成</p>
<p>新近看到了一本托派的宣傳刊物，他們居然自認爲是最澈底抗日的了，在他們的描寫中，好像國民政府十八個月來，還沒有和日本帝國主義打過一個回合，國民黨和共產黨時時刻刻準備投降，而共產黨呢，那末就只有把全部力量來打擊他們這一夥一「托匪」，也沒有去抗日，眞正「澈底」抗日的，只有他們這一夥「托匪」，而他們目前的主要活動方針，却是「同國共兩黨的壓制政策作不調和的鬥爭」。</p>
<p>這就是這夥無恥的匪徒們，在新的政治形勢下的新任務，從這裏，也可以充份地證明他們的新陰謀和其兩面派的眞面目。這眞面目：就是他們現在是要惜「澈底抗日」之名，來進行同國共兩黨，同全國抗戰的政府，軍隊和人民，「作不調和的鬥爭」了。</p>
<p>然而，剛好，現在就讓我們抓着這狐狸的尾巴，來把他們的嘴巴打歪吧，這是最容易下手的。我們只要提出這樣的問題，要他們這些無恥的傢伙答覆：</p>
<p>第一，十八個月來，國民政府領導之下的軍隊，展開了幾千里的戰綫和×人浴血戰鬬，直接參加作戰的軍隊及武裝民衆超過一千萬，殺死殺傷×人七十萬，耗損×人國力三分之一，這些工作，究竟其中那一些是托派做的，如果沒有他們的份兒，那末他們就根本沒有參加抗日，更談不上澈底抗日。</p>
<p>第二，十八個月來，共產黨員在×人後方工作的有幾十萬，他們組織了幾十萬人民抗日武裝。在×人後方建立了抗日根據能和抗日政權，單單說第八路軍，在去年一年中，已繳獲×人步槍九千一百枝，擊燬×人飛機一百二十架，殺傷及俘虜×人無數，現在已派了兩旅部隊挺進僞滿洲國境活動，在東北的共產黨員楊靖宇趙尙志等，組織了幾十萬人民抗日武裝，在×人佔領地艱苦奮鬥已經八個年頭了。所有這些工作，有那一件是托派能够做得來的呢了如果不能那末他們不能抗日，更談不上比共產黨更澈底抗日。</p>
<p>第三，托派旣然要澈底抗日，同時又說敵人力量强大，我們非再增千百萬倍力量不足以制勝，他們却又要首先和有幾百萬黨員的兩個最大政黨「作不調和的鬥爭」，反對建立抗日民族統一戰線，試問托派究竟憑什麽力量去和敵人作「澈底」的抗戰，敵人侵入我們大部份的領土已經十八個月了，今後將更加緊與更殘酷的戰鬥，在這樣的危急存亡之秋，×人是否會停止總攻，讓這些托派老爺去消滅了國民黨和共產黨，再來「澈底抗日」？</p>
<p>第四，托派旣然自誇是最「澈底」抗日的，那末他們的黨徒在徐州參加了×人的列動隊。在廣西陰謀暴動，是否就算是他們的「澈底」抗日的行動表現，如果這些就是他們的澈底抗日的行動，這那末中國民衆依據十八個月的抗戰經驗，是懂得怎樣撲滅這些叛徒加日完全有把握來撲滅這些叛徒的任何活動的。</p>
<p>現在，任何人也可以看出這些無恥匪徒的陰謀了吧？他們企圖使人們離開那些眞正澈底抗日的路線——抗日民族統一戰線，而跟着他們的拆散抗日陣線的假「澈底」抗日的路線——漢奸路線走，這就是日帝國主義的政治分化的計劃，就是×人以華制華的毒計。誰看不出這是×人指使的奸細，就是戲子。</p>
<p>也許有人覺得這些好細們爲什麽偏偏也抬出抗日的招牌，是一件奇事，其實不知這剛剛是一切奸細們的特點，你看，那主和的汪精衛以前不是開口抗戰閉口犧牲到底的人物嗎？托派匪徒是尤其會玩這一套把戲的。</p>
<h3 id="c66">躭擱在星甸廟前後 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>前天下了雨，紅色的土坭路上，低陷的地方還是一片片泥漿，可是高亢的一邊，被西北風一吹，已是凍得比石塊都硬——獨輪車的鐵皮車輪，就在這一帶深淺不一的、滿佈轍痕的路上不停的跳躍着，雖則這種車子元自坐不慣，屁股儘管往下滑，可是在山路上默默的聽着車輪單調的嘶呌，看着滿眼衰草紅葉，（頭頂上有幾朶白雲在划過），心也就不禁鬆弛了下來，幾里長的兵士，匆徨的逃難人羣，飛奔的火車，擁擠的輪渡，彷彿是許久許久以前他事，而且眞確性，是大可疑惑的。</p>
<p>樵夫在砍山柴，一位鄕間的太太，橫坐在頸下掛滿銅鈴的馿子背上，響亮的走來，又走遠了，要不是耳朶仍舊可以淸晰聽到×機轟炸首都的沉悶聲響，眞會疑心祗是自己做了一个噩夢的。</p>
<p>到包圍在群山中間的星甸廟時，已是第三天的中午，這兒正在趕集，賣山貨的，賣年貨的，元宵担子，線粉担子，縛在樹上的馬，馿子，熱閙得什麽似的，難道火藥的氣味，和轟炸的聲響，都被四周的高山眞的擋住了嗎；這兒的老百姓是那麽快樂，謐靜與毫不關心。</p>
<p>晚餐過後，有許多强壯的鄕民，跑進漢吾的屋子來，一邊控聽外邊的戰事消息，一邊詢問「事情」預備得怎樣了，還是一副淡漠的神氣，連眉毛都不多掀一掀的。</p>
<p>就是在他們走後，漢吾才吿訴我星甸廟比南京都「討厭」要是×人侵佔了浦口滁縣，星甸廟便整个在封鎖狀態中，仝時十多年來沒敢露面的土匪，現在居然敢在茶館裏，糾衆商議收只槍支的事，所以星甸廟外邊有×人，內部還有土匪的威脅。</p>
<p>他隨後安慰我似的笑了笑，吿訴我他已經組織了幾百个人的游擊隊，他和一个堂兄弟，都是中央軍校的敎官，所以朋練與戰鬥方面都是不成問題的，他們的第一個步驟是肅淸土匪，然後　滅實進來的小股×人。我在星甸廟祗住了短短的三天，情形却愈來愈嚴重。敵機天天在轟炸南京，浦口。而且已經可以聽到砲聲了，我於是第二度帶了妻子從山裏出來踏上津流綫預備韓到廣東來。</p>
<p>紅色的山坭路上，不再是　寂無人的了。從浦口來的，從南京來的，挑箱籠的背包裹的，騎馿的，坐車的徒步的，老人，女人，小孩，叫着，閙着，哭着，組成一股難以形容的悲痛洪流，這組洪流就是衝向星旬廟去的。</p>
<p>在江浦縣城外，我們下車來吃了幾碗糖元宵，賣元宵的老頭兒吿訴我：</p>
<p>「這個年頭兒，活了眞此死了受罪啊！死了眼閉了，什麽都不知道了，可是活了，你却要受苦。昨天這兒路上就掉下六七個小孩子，哭得什慶似的」今天又是幾個，你說爲什麽要避鬼子呢？來了正好打啊！以前不是找都找不到嗎？活了要受罪。受氣，死了便什麽郁沒有了，爲什麽不打呢？」</p>
<p>我給他銅子的時候，他還是一逕在搖着頭，</p>

<p>— 羅昔</p>
<p>海在澎湃，風在呼號。岸邊山畔，漁人們的血液已流紅了茫茫的碧海，靑靑的野草。</p>
<p>海是漁人們的家，捕魚是漁人們的生涯；千代百代，沒有誰人會離開美麗的漁邨，這多魚的港汊。</p>
<p>由天邊浮來了巨大的艨艟，把漁人們的血液染得一片鮮紅。</p>
<p>誰敢出海，誰就不能歸來；誰敢回家，誰就死在刀下：漁人們的胸膛，漁人們的頸項，天天開着紅花。</p>
<p>這，這是什麽卅界哪！</p>
<p>刀口外的　人不敢出海，不敢回家。在荒僻的郊野，人們怒號，人們喧嘩：</p>
<p>「我們要回家，我們要港，我們不能餓死在荒野！」</p>
<p>『橫竪是死，不如和他拼去吧！』</p>
<p>於是，男人拿起魚叉，女人拿起石塊：爲了要漁邨，爲了要港汊，漁人們，已沒有一個會起害怕。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Economic Retaliation by Britain and America Against Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bo An</p>
<p>Since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese have been loudly advocating the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," implementing economic monopolies in occupied areas and excluding the interests of third countries. In North China, they have implemented trade controls, and in Central China, they have used the pretext of private arms smuggling and dangerous navigation to refuse third-country ships from navigating the Yangtze River. As a result, Japanese goods now account for more than half of the value of imports in North China. Japanese goods in the Yangtze River basin have also jumped from third to first place. The so-called principle of open door and equal opportunity has been fundamentally broken. Recently, Japan has even openly declared that the old principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are no longer applicable to the new situation, and it intends to unilaterally break the treaty. Under this current situation, Britain and the United States have only to decide whether or not to withdraw from the Far East. Britain's decades of hard work in China have already taken root. Although trade with China has declined in recent years, investment still ranks first. Although the United States has less investment, trade often ranks first. Therefore, Britain and the United States are unwilling to passively abandon their past hard-earned businesses and withdraw from the Chinese market. Recently, due to the ineffectiveness of protests, economic retaliation has been considered.</p>
<p>The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>Since the failure of the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy during the Italian-Abyssinian War, many people have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of economic sanctions. The Italian-Abyssinian War broke out in early October 1935. In November, the League of Nations held a meeting and decided to impose economic sanctions on Italy. Of the League of Nations' 58 member states, except for Italy, Abyssinia, Austria, Hungary, Albania, Paraguay, and other countries that refused to impose sanctions, 52 countries participated in the sanctions. The sanctions included: (1) Financial disconnection; (2) Trade sanctions, including prohibiting the import of Italian goods and prohibiting the transport of military supplies, mineral products, and metal products to Italy. After the implementation of the League of Nations' sanctions, Italy also used the means of boycotting imports from participating countries as retaliation, and implemented financial, trade, and consumption controls to resist. In addition, Italy is a country with an import surplus, and in recent years, the import surplus has often been more than 20 billion lire. In foreign trade, Germany and the United States are the largest. Imports and exports to Germany both rank first, accounting for 17% of imports and 16% of exports. The United States ranks second. However, both countries are non-member states and have no obligation to fulfill the League of Nations' resolutions. The same is true for Japan and Brazil. Switzerland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and other member states cited their close proximity to Italy and close trade relations as reasons for reserving their positions on the sanctions. The steps taken by various countries were inconsistent, and the methods were not thorough. For example, coal and gasoline were never prohibited from being exported to Italy. Therefore, the League of Nations' sanctions failed to stop Italy's war of aggression. In June 1936, Britain took the lead in advocating the lifting of sanctions against Italy, and other countries followed suit. This marked the end of the era of economic sanctions in modern history.</p>
<p>The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Japan</p>
<p>In military terms, Japan's situation is different from Italy's. The Italian-Abyssinian War lasted only more than half a year, and the effect of economic sanctions was not seen before Abyssinia was lost. Japan has been using troops against China for a year and a half, and both sets of capital have been exhausted (Yosuke Matsuoka said that Japan has three sets of capital: (1) government reserves; (2) idle social capital; (3) private material resources). The end of the war is nowhere in sight. The Hiranuma cabinet intended to strengthen fascist control and conscript private material resources to achieve its goals; however, it is already mired in China, and it will be difficult to support if it encounters external shocks again.</p>
<p>In terms of international trade, the situation in Japan and Italy is also very different. Economic sanctions against Japan were proposed by Britain and the United States, and Japan's trade with Britain and the United States accounts for more than half of its total trade. In 1937, Japanese goods sold to Britain and British territories reached 900 million yen, and goods shipped to the United States also reached 600 million yen, accounting for half of Japan's export trade. In the same year, goods from Britain and British territories shipped to Japan reached 1.2 billion yen, and US goods shipped to Japan also reached 1.27 billion yen, accounting for one-third of Japan's import trade. Japan's trade relations with Britain and the United States are so huge that the serious impact of economic sanctions by Britain and the United States can be imagined.</p>
<p>Looking at the goods traded between the United States and Japan, silk is the largest commodity shipped from Japan to the United States, with an annual value of about 300 million yen, followed by cotton cloth, with an annual value of about 50 million yen, followed by clothing and porcelain, pottery, etc. Cotton is the most goods shipped from the United States to Japan, with an annual value of about 300 million yen, followed by coal, gasoline, and metal products, each with an annual value of about 100 million yen, followed by military equipment and machinery, etc. In terms of trade volume, the United States has a trade surplus and Japan has a trade deficit, giving the United States an advantage. In terms of the nature of the goods, the goods shipped from the United States to Japan are mostly necessities, such as coal, gasoline, metal products, and machinery, which are all essential for Japan's national defense and industry. Even cotton is an indispensable raw material because China's production is not enough to meet Japan's needs. The goods shipped from Japan to the United States are consumer goods. If the United States imposes commercial sanctions on Japan, there will be no adverse effects domestically, while Japan will suffer significant losses. For example, if sales of silk in the United States are cut off, Japan's rural economy will be hit immediately.</p>
<p>British-Japanese trade is similar to US-Japanese trade. Seafood is the largest commodity shipped from Japan to Britain, with an annual value of 30 million yen, followed by raw silk and cotton cloth. Machinery and boats are the largest commodities shipped from Britain to Japan, with an annual value of about 20 million yen, followed by metal products. British goods are necessities, while Japanese goods are consumer goods. Japanese goods are also in a surplus position, so Japan has the greatest advantage in British-Japanese trade. As for the trade between Japan and British territories, it is almost an exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials. For example, Japan imports about 300 million yen of Indian cotton every year, while it ships about 200 million yen of cotton textiles to India every year. Australia ships about 100 million yen of wool and about 20 million yen of wheat to Japan every year, while Japan ships 50 million yen of cotton textiles to Australia every year. If British colonies cut off trade with Japan, Japanese manufactured goods will lack a market, and raw materials will lack a source, suffocating industry.</p>
<p>Recent trade statistics between Japan, Britain, and the United States (unit: million yen)</p>
<p>Why Haven't Britain and the United States Launched Economic Sanctions Yet?</p>
<p>Since Japan is poor in resources and relies on foreign trade, economic pressure from Britain and the United States would be a fatal blow to Japan. Why haven't Britain and the United States taken active action? The political reasons are beyond the scope of my discussion. The commercial reasons are the obstruction of some businessmen. For example, Indian cotton, metal traders, Australian wool and wheat merchants, and US cotton, machinery, coal, and oil merchants all oppose sanctions against Japan due to their own interests. The British and American governments are also worried about mutual retaliation, which could lead to serious disputes. President Biffman said that economic sanctions could bring aggressors to justice, while Bola said that economic sanctions could lead to war. Whether economic sanctions can lead to war does not have a definite conclusion in theory. It depends on the actual situation. The key question is whether Japan can resist Britain and the United States economically and militarily. I believe that if Britain and the United States take a united front and are determined to curb Japanese aggression, the Japanese warlords may not take the risk immediately. However, the fear of war in Britain and the United States is enough to increase the arrogance of aggressor countries and use their intimidation tactics. In September last year, when the League of Nations asked its member states to provide individual economic assistance to China and impose sanctions on Japan, the Japanese government spokesman threatened that if the powers changed their neutrality, Japan would consider its attitude towards foreign concessions in China. Britain and the United States have the largest interests in China, mostly in Shanghai. According to Lamer's statistics, British investment in China is 119 million gold, of which Shanghai accounts for three-quarters. US investment in China is 100 million US dollars, of which Shanghai accounts for 64%. In addition, according to the "International Investment Problems" published by the British "Royal Institute of International Affairs" in 1937, US investment in Japan totaled 440 million US dollars by the end of 1933, mostly government bonds, about twice as much as investment in China. British investment in Japan was estimated at 63 million pounds in 1930, which is only a quarter of the 110 million US dollars invested in China. However, according to Kindley's estimate published in the Economic News in December 1937, British investment in Japan at the end of 1936 was 53 million pounds (mostly government bonds). Investment in China was 41 million pounds. This means that British investment in Japan is greater than investment in China, which contradicts Lamer's estimate. The exact situation remains to be verified. In short, both investments in Japan and China are under Japanese control. Perhaps Britain and the United States have a fear of harming the cause when implementing severe economic sanctions against Japan?</p>
<p>Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Retaliation by Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The difficulties encountered by Britain in retaliating against Japan in commerce are temporary. From the perspective of the entire British economy, it may even be considered beneficial. For example, the British textile industry has always felt the pain of Japanese competition. After sanctions against Japan, although Indian cotton and Australian wool exports to Japan will decrease, the British cotton and wool textile industry will prosper, and the cotton and wool raw materials can be digested by the British mainland. The same is true for US cotton. Before the war, Japan only imported 1 million bales of cotton from abroad, while Britain imported 4 million bales. Later, due to the prosperity of the Japanese textile industry and the decline of Britain, Japan's imports of foreign cotton increased to 3.6 million bales in 1935, while Britain's imports decreased to just over 2 million bales. The world's cotton trade volume has always been around 12 million bales (each bale weighs 500 pounds gross and 478 pounds net) for decades, without major fluctuations. Therefore, US cotton sales can still return to Britain. Other US goods, such as coal, oil, and machinery, do not rely on Japan as a customer. As for the concern about Japan's so-called retaliation, the actions of Japan when Britain and the United States provided loans to China show that this is unlikely to happen.</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Study of Resistance Tactics Against [Enemy] <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>On the Important Tasks of Improving Troops (3)</p>
<p>Second, all troops must pay attention to mobility and teamwork. Regardless of what kind of tactics we use, mobility and teamwork are indispensable to achieving combat results. The current combat organization of each troop is known to everyone to have mobility, but it has never been achieved. Once there is action, it cannot be achieved quickly and nimbly! In the future, the mobility of the troops must be cultivated, the command deployment must be appropriate and suitable; the marching ability must be improved as much as possible; attention must be paid to nighttime actions and the use of transportation tools. These are all important conditions for increasing mobility. Only with great mobility can troops cope with modern three-dimensional warfare, exert combat power, seize opportunities, and defeat the [enemy]. As for teamwork, it is especially important in relation to the victory or defeat of war. As I said just now, the [enemy] is accustomed to using the tactic of defeating us individually to make our troops lose contact. We must cultivate the habit and ability of officers and soldiers to cooperate in action. In particular, we must use the front to attack and defend, and use the main reserve to carry out flank attacks. All officers and soldiers must have the spirit and ability to cooperate in action in order to achieve offensive and defensive results. Also, the [enemy] attacks our army, specializing in attacking our weak forces or gaps in the position to break in. Therefore, we must deploy reserves and establish firm contact in the adjacent areas of each unit. If the [enemy] attacks one point of our position, the surrounding neighboring units must cooperate in action, assist friendly forces, and annihilate the [enemy]. We must know that in the face of a great enemy, the life and death, success and failure of our entire national army are integrated. There is no possibility of a friendly army being defeated and we still being able to exist—there is no room for preserving strength at this time. If we want to preserve our strength, we will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the puppet Manchukuo army, falling into a miserable situation where we cannot live or die, and being forced by the [enemy] army to take machine guns to the battlefield to kill our compatriots. Our revolutionary soldiers must be able to distinguish clearly between right and wrong and see the advantages and disadvantages clearly. Today, we can only share life and death and share weal and woe. To kill the [enemy] and save the country and fight in coordination, we must fundamentally eliminate the past military mentality of talking about factions, distinguishing between each other, watching friendly forces sacrifice, and preserving one's own strength—the entire national army must be united as one and act in concert to complete the task of resisting the [enemy] and saving the country—</p>
<p>Third, we must strive for initiative. The key to initiative is that we must set a plan and implement it step by step, forcing the [enemy] to act according to our plan. To put it plainly, it is to "attack what they must save and take what they must fight for," so that they have no time to defend themselves and are everywhere in a passive position. When the [enemy] is passive, we can exert our combat power to defeat them. Now that the [enemy] has penetrated deep into our interior, the front line is extended, and the war zone is expanded. This is a good opportunity for us to vigorously carry out active offensive warfare. In the future, whether we are attacking or defending, we must act proactively. To be proactive, our chiefs of staff must have keen eyes and resolute courage when planning and deciding—based on detailed enemy intelligence, determine all strategies. The flanking tactics to break the [enemy]'s "cone-shaped突擊" that I mentioned above is the only secret to taking the initiative to attack and defend—once we have set this tactic, everyone must adapt to the actual situation of the [enemy] in each battlefield and implement it accurately. Only by controlling the [enemy] in everything and maintaining the initiative at all times can we achieve tactical and strategic success!</p>
<p>The above is about the tactics of breaking the [enemy]'s "cone-shaped 突擊" habit and the necessary conditions for using tactics. Now I will talk about several important tasks that the combat troops should improve in the future:</p>
<p>First, we must treat prisoners of war well and reward the capture and preservation of spoils of war. This operation has been going on for more than half a year, and very few prisoners of war and spoils of war have been sent up by the front-line troops. This shows that our combat troops lack knowledge or the level is insufficient, and they do not know that with prisoners of war, we can interrogate the [enemy]'s situation, and treating prisoners of war well is the morality that soldiers should have during wartime and an important method of disintegrating the [enemy] army. Various spoils of war are the most valuable materials for studying the [enemy]'s situation. Now the officers and soldiers at the front kill prisoners of war at will, and many [enemy] equipment documents!—operational orders and plans are casually lost or discarded. There are materials for research, but they do not know to submit them. Valuable spoils of war are obtained, but they do not know how to research and preserve them. These are all the results of our imperfect peacetime troop education! The [enemy] is not like this. They turn in everything, even a shoe, a hat, a piece of paper, a single word, and use it as a reference for research. Important things are studied, organized, registered, and labeled with the name of the item, unit number, officer and soldier's name, time and place of acquisition, and stored in the historical exhibition hall as educational materials for aggression—we now need to study the [enemy]'s situation, lack materials, and leave valuable memories for the sacred war of resistance to comfort the heroic spirits who died for the country and show future generations the historical lessons—and the spoils of war from the front have not been submitted piece by piece. This is a matter that urgently needs to be improved. In the future, everyone must especially warn their subordinates that, first, it is forbidden to kill prisoners of war and they must be ordered to send them up; second, no matter how big or small the things captured from the [enemy], whether it is a gun, a knife, a piece of clothing, a hat, a piece of paper, or a line of words, they must be submitted to the command and sent to the military committee for research and preservation. Our senior commanders and chiefs of staff must teach their subordinates in every way and must implement rewards in accordance with the war reward methods promulgated last time so that they know that capturing prisoners of war and spoils of war is extremely meritorious and honorable. It is also the most rare opportunity for our officers and men to leave a heroic name in the history of the war of resistance. Every officer and soldier must have this knowledge, and everyone must take pride in treating prisoners of war well and sending in spoils of war. If our education can produce this extremely effective result, we can invisibly increase the combat power of the troops a lot!</p>
<p>Second, orders must be implemented, and the supervision of the implementation of orders must be strict. Everyone must know that the orders of the army are the orders on which the life and death of the entire army depend. Whether the order can be executed and whether the execution can be implemented is related to the safety and survival of the entire army—therefore, any order, no matter who it is given to, must be taken seriously and implemented thoroughly, and there must be no slight ease, negligence, or disloyalty in the execution. Everyone must also know that the superior's order is a path that shows our lives. We obey the order,</p>

<h3 id="e3">Battles on All Fronts Intensify; We Fight Steadily and Seize the Initiative; [Enemy] Forces Suffer Setbacks Everywhere They Invade <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Our military forces on all fronts continue to fight steadily to adapt to the long-term war of resistance. Therefore, the [enemy]'s advance is difficult, and we can take the initiative and operate freely. We continue to do our best to maintain the traffic in the areas entirely controlled by our forces. For example, trains from Guilin can go directly to Jinhua. As for the railways in the areas occupied by the [enemy], we use guerrilla forces to destroy them at any time. Although the [enemy] has been constantly attacking us in Guangdong, Shanxi, Hubei, and eastern Henan recently, they have made little progress. Our situation in central Hubei is stable. Fierce local battles continue on all fronts in Guangdong. It is certain that a certain elite unit of ours has cut off the communication between Conghua, Zengcheng, and Dongguan, and the battle situation will develop within days.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] According to information, Chinese and Japanese troops engaged in fierce battles near the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province, from Quanzhoudian through Hua County to the Zhongshen area. On the South China front, the Japanese army attempted to cross the river near Sanshui and advance northward along the Yuehan Railway in separate columns, but they were blocked. Also, the Japanese army concentrated their forces near the northern coast and shelled the onshore forts, but the Japanese army was unable to land. It is also reported that when the Japanese army retreated from Sanshui, they were about to launch a major offensive in central China. The Japanese army is also attempting to advance along Hankou to Yichang, and fierce shelling has been reported.</p>
<p>The Situation in Guangdong is Tense</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 20th] The war in Guangdong has been showing a state of alternating weakness and tension. In recent days, they have suddenly launched fierce attacks on our positions everywhere. According to the situation on various telephone lines at the front, (1) five or six hundred [enemy] soldiers attacked a certain regiment's certain battalion's position at Daguan in Zengcheng the day before yesterday. Fierce fighting lasted all day, and the [enemy] suffered casualties amounting to a quarter of their force. The stalemate continued until last night, when the [enemy] fled back to Zengcheng. We suffered dozens of officer and soldier casualties. (2) The night before last, a certain [enemy] regiment launched an attack on a certain battalion of ours near Longgang Market. After fighting until the hour of Jia, we retreated to the vicinity of Huaxian to defend due to excessive losses. (3) More than four hundred soldiers of the Kōhashi unit launched a sneak attack on a certain regiment of a certain division of ours. A battle occurred in the vicinity of Gao and Dian. Last night, the [enemy] sent reinforcements of six or seven hundred men to attack us, and our army responded calmly. The battle situation is quite fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] The [enemy]'s 119th Division has arrived in the Yongxiu area from Taiwan. Currently, there are six [enemy] divisions in northern Jiangxi. In addition, there are 20,000 [enemy] soldiers who arrived in Tianjin a few days ago and then went to western Sui.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 21st] The [enemy] forces that successively departed from Sanshui to Henggang and Langgang were attacked along the way by our self-defense teams and retreated to Sanshui on the 17th. The [enemy] forces in Tanbu also withdrew to Wupin Market on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haikou, 21st] A total of eleven [enemy] ships, including one aircraft carrier, continued to arrive at Weizhou Island on the morning of the 17th, but there were no movements.</p>
<p>[Enemy] Troops in Southern Hebei Stir</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 20th] Military information indicates that the [enemy] in Hebei is attempting to invade southern Hebei again to eliminate our anti-Japanese armed forces. Currently, more than a thousand [enemy] soldiers have arrived in Jin County and are attacking Donglu, Huai, and Lingping. The [enemy] in Qijiawan is attacking Julu and is fighting with a certain unit of ours on the riverbank. There are more than a thousand [enemy] soldiers in Heping Township, and two thousand [enemy] soldiers have been added to Yongnian. Three hundred [enemy] soldiers have arrived in Feixiang, and more than a thousand [enemy] soldiers have arrived in Guangping, attempting to encircle us. The [enemy] in Quzhou and Dezhou are showing signs of advancing towards Wucheng and Zhengjiakou. Our Second Guerrilla Team and the People's White Team have been properly deployed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hequ, 18th] The puppet army under the command of Yu Ni Zhi, which attacked our position from Guyang a few days ago, has been defeated and fled back to the city. A certain unit of ours has now advanced to the area between Guyang and Anbei to carry out guerrilla warfare against the [enemy].</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] News reports that the traffic on the railways in North China is constantly being sabotaged by our army, completely breaking the [enemy]'s propaganda that "there are no guerrilla teams within 30 li of the railway line."

<h3 id="e4">Foreign War Correspondents Assert That China Will Win <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Local News] Recently, a famous American war correspondent observed the Chinese and Japanese sides on various battlefields in China and has now returned home via Hong Kong. He pointed out more than ten advantages of our army, proving that our army will win the final victory in the war of resistance. At the same time, he pointed out several weaknesses of the Japanese army, proving that the Japanese army will suffer a crushing defeat in China. (1) The more Chinese troops die, the more they fight, and the braver they become. (2) The fewer Japanese troops die, the less they fight, and the more discouraged they become. (3) The Japanese mechanized units completely lose their power after entering mountain warfare. (4) China has a large reserve of new-style firearms, which is sufficient for long-term war of resistance, and the small-scale ordnance factories in the Chinese rear can manufacture rifles and bullets themselves, which is sufficient for the needs of the army. (5) China's international routes in the north, south, and southwest are open, and the latest-style airplanes, artillery, and tanks are being transported to the Chinese rear, and the Japanese army's airplanes, ships, and vehicles cannot stop their transportation. (6) The Japanese army's rear forces are weak, making it extremely difficult to cope with Chinese guerrilla attacks. After a considerable period of time, the Japanese rear will become China's front. (7) The Japanese military expenditure is five times that of China, so they will not be able to support a long war. (8) China has rich resources in the southwest and north, and the economic power of the war of resistance is endless. (9) The Japanese army's forces have now become exhausted, and the time of their defeat is not far away. If China can continue the war of resistance, it will win the final victory.</p>

<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 21st] A foreign dispatch from Hankou states that the Japanese and French sides had originally agreed that starting from the 20th, the Japanese would supply tap water to the French Concession and the barriers of the French Concession would be completely open.

<p>[Hankou, Associated Press, 21st] Nakamura, Chairman of the Japan Oriental Culture Association, recently returned from the United States and told this agency's reporter that the so-called New Order in East Asia includes Annam and * countries, because the people of * countries do not enjoy the treatment they deserve today. He said, "Frankly speaking, the purpose of our building a New Order in East Asia is to make other countries deal with China through Japan."</p>
<p>[Washington, Associated Press, 21st] American figures welcome Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's renewed statement that Japan has no intention of closing the Open Door in China. However, because many private individuals and merchants in China have been discriminated against by the Japanese, and foreign businesses in the Three Eastern Provinces have been completely shut down by the puppet government's suppression, officials here fear that commercial activities in China will also receive similar treatment in the future. Therefore, they frankly express extreme skepticism about Arita's statement. Furthermore, Arita's threat to Annam to stop transporting military supplies to China, otherwise necessary measures will be taken to deal with it, is still considered by officials here to be trapped in the old ways of power politics, a tactic often used by spokespersons for Japan, Germany, and Italy in recent years. Therefore, some of the best-informed diplomats believe that the US's fortification of Guam is a means of resisting this kind of power politics.</p>

<p>[Tokyo, Reuters, 21st] The House of Peers reopened this morning at 10:00 AM after the New Year recess. Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita both delivered speeches. The two explained the current situation and plans, and stated the future policies of the Japanese government. They also hoped that the Chinese would cooperate with Japan and Taiwan without harboring any fear; otherwise, establishing a New Order in East Asia would be impossible. Hiranuma said in a 3,500-word speech that for the Chinese who do not understand this intention and still resist Japan, we have no other path to follow but to eliminate them, and so on. Contrary to expectations, Arita did not directly mention the recent notes from Britain, France, and the United States. Subsequently, the Ministers of the Army and Navy will provide reports on the war situation in China. The House of Representatives will meet at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and the members will also listen to speeches by the respective ministers.</p>
<p>Arita's Speech Attacks the World Situation, Revealing Aggressive Ambitions</p>
<p>[Tokyo, Associated Press, 21st] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita addressed the Parliament, asking Britain, the United States, and other major powers to jointly enjoy the prosperity of East Asia, but only on the condition of recognizing Japan's major position in East Asia. Arita also warned France and the Soviet Union, advising them not to aid China against Japan, otherwise retaliatory action would be taken. The main points of the speech are roughly as follows: (1) Japan must maintain its announced determination to build a New Order in East Asia through the cooperation of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo," so that the whole world will benefit in the future. (2) Japan intends to impose considerable restrictions on China and "Manchukuo," but this restriction is related to national defense and will be limited to the minimum extent. (3) Japan intends to link the East Asian economy with the world economy in order to increase the material prosperity of mankind. (4) If Chinese military supplies are still transported through Annam, then "appropriate steps" will be taken to deal with it. (5) Japan hopes that the new central government of China (?) will soon be organized and cooperate with "us to resolve the Sino-Japanese War." (6) Japan will continue to attack the Third International, because Japan believes that the purpose of the Third International is to make China and the whole world red. (7) Although the Zhanggufeng Incident has been resolved, Soviet-Japanese relations will continue to be tense, especially since the Russians in Northern Sakhalin are now interfering with Japan's oil, coal, and fishing rights.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, Reuters, 20th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita stated at the opening of the Japanese Diet that trade between Britain and the United States and "Manchukuo" is even better now than before "Manchukuo" was established. Under Japan's plan to create a "New Order in East Asia," China and "Manchukuo" will maintain their independence and actively cooperate. Japan believes that this can achieve true peace and world happiness. He repeatedly stated that Japan does not demand "China" to cede land or pay indemnities, and will fully respect "China's" sovereignty and consider abolishing extraterritoriality and concessions. Although Japan has repeatedly stated its position, there are still various misunderstandings from the outside world that Japan wants to close China's open door. In fact, some important areas have been restricted, but other areas are still wide open. Not only are the rights and interests of foreigners and their people not affected, but foreign participation is also welcome. He discussed the "China Incident," saying that Japan is working hard on construction and fiercely attacking the Third International, stating that the disruption of peace and order in Europe and Asia is due to the Third International's planning. The prolongation of the Chinese war and the guerrilla warfare strategy are all from the Third International, and asked that the main reason for the world's unrest today is due to striving to maintain the status quo, but maintaining it is not in accordance with justice, but in relying on selfishness to prevent the progress of emerging countries.</p>
<p>Party Politics Show Division at the Opening of Parliament</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 20th] On the eve of the opening of the new parliament, there are signs of a split in the Seiyukai, one of Japan's two major political parties. Fifty members of the party held a separate meeting today to express their distrust of the party's executives. In addition, various political parties also held general meetings today to determine their attitude towards the opening of the new parliament. For example, the Minseito, which ranks first, passed a declaration stating that the fate of Japan and the peace of East Asia depend on the outcome of this Sino-Japanese war. All the people should firmly unite and overcome all difficulties in order to achieve this goal. The declaration also urged the government to establish a "unified new government of China" and seek cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." The Seiyukai's declaration stated: "The Chiang regime" has retreated to the interior but is still continuing to resist Japan, and third countries are gradually indicating their intention to assist Chiang. It will take time for Japan to achieve its goals, so it should mobilize its spiritual, cultural, economic, political, and military forces to fulfill its mission.</p>
<p>Cabinet Meeting Decides on Measures for Parliament, Reviews General Budget</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 20th] Tokyo News: The Japanese Cabinet meeting was held at 10:30 AM on the 20th.

<p>[Central News Agency, ***, 21st] Tokyo News: Japan's military budget for 1939-1940 is estimated to be 549 million yen, of which 49 million will be paid from the ordinary budget, and the other 50 million will be allocated from the special budget. The ordinary budget can be submitted to parliament for discussion today, and opinions on the special budget will be exchanged on February 30th. This special budget is entirely for the cost of the war against China and the stationing of troops in "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Former Japanese Home Minister Suehiro Nobusada, former Finance Minister Yuki Toyotaro, and Seiyukai leader Shimada Toshio have all been appointed as advisors to the Hiranuma Cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The Newspaper Industry in Yunnan <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Kunming Special Correspondent] Yunnan is located in a remote border region, and the newspaper industry has not been very developed due to transportation, culture, and other factors. The earliest published newspapers appeared during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. However, at that time, the public was uninformed and lacked knowledge of newspapers, not like today when people have a paper in hand and regard it as spiritual food. Furthermore, reporters were looked down upon, just like in Shanghai in the past. Therefore, although Yunnan's newspapers have more than 20 years of history, it is not easy to see their role in promoting social reform and customs. The current situation of various newspapers in Yunnan is introduced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Minguo Daily," run by the provincial party headquarters, with Wang Songlu as the president and Yan Zhuhe as the editor. The office is located on Huashan South Road, with a circulation of over 2,600. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, there are editorials written by the Central Propaganda Institute, instructing people on their understanding of the war effort, and there is a supplement called "Daguan." It was previously suspended due to the reduction of pages due to the war. Recently, starting from New Year's Day this year, given that its fellow newspaper "Yishi Daily" has special supplements such as "Nian Yuan Di" and "Zhaobao" also has a supplement, it has been gradually publishing essays and novels to restore its old appearance, with a circulation of about 7,000 to 8,000 copies.</p>
<p>(2) "Yunnan Daily," the official newspaper of the provincial government, with Chen Ke as the president and Zhang Kecheng as the editor. The office is located on Wenmiao Heng Street, facing the Provincial Kunhua People's Education Museum. Its circulation covers all prefectures, counties, and towns in Yunnan Province, reaching about 13,000 copies, making it the most widely circulated newspaper in Yunnan. Local news is quite detailed, and it has been published to over 1,050 issues. In addition to expanding the office and recruiting staff, starting from December 12th last year, it has also restored the "Nanfeng" supplement, which was changed to a weekly due to the war. Each issue can only publish "4,000 words," containing novels, essays, poems, notes, etc., with a similar nature to the "Daguan" supplement of "Minguo Daily." This may be due to the lack of flexibility of hard news, and is intended to compensate for it. The newspaper's weekly reviews are written by specially invited famous domestic writers, with a fee of at least 10 yuan in national currency per article.</p>
<p>In addition to "Minguo Daily" and "Yunnan Daily," there are also "New Commercial Daily" (President Wang Hansheng, Editor Hu Zheng), "Social New Daily" (President Long Zimin, Editor Tu Xiu*), "Fearless Daily" (President * Renfu, Editor Ma Zhongling), "Righteous Voice Daily" (President Zi Jucai, Editor Li Xiaochun), and "Jun Daily" (President Duan Quanchang, Editor Zhao Yusheng). However, compared to the progressive and widely circulated newspapers, only "Yunnan Daily" and "Minguo Daily" were available before the Double Tenth Festival last year.</p>
<p>"Nanjing Zhaobao" was forced to withdraw in the winter of the previous year with the fall of the capital. Manager Wang Gonghong came to guide the preparations for a long time, and it resumed publication here on the Double Tenth Festival of the 27th year (1938). It is a small sheet every day, with the same format as it was in Nanjing. The first page has domestic telegrams, the second page has international news, the third page has local news, and the fourth page has a supplement, with a circulation of about 7,000 to 8,000. When it was first published, one could hear newspaper vendors selling it on the streets early in the morning at around 7:00 AM. The general public mostly read it because it was published very early. In comparison, "Yunnan Daily" and "Minguo Daily," which were published later, had to compete with each other by issuing their newspapers earlier. In addition, the influence of the * undoubtedly made it much more convenient for those who loved to read newspapers.</p>
<p>Following "Zhaobao," there is "Tianjin Yishi Daily," which was forced to suspend publication in August of the 26th year (1937) due to the pressure of the anti-Japanese war. It is the propaganda organ of the Chinese Catholic Church. Under the leadership of Bishop Yu Bin, it first launched "Yishi Weekly" here last year on the Double Tenth Festival, and then resumed the daily newspaper on December 8th. Every day, in addition to occasional communications from various places, there are also weekly supplements on religion and culture, border areas, history, education, reading, women, youth garden, and book reviews. This is unique to the newspapers in Kunming and is a characteristic of the newspaper, which is quite popular among young students. However, the newspaper has very little local news, which seems to have been overlooked, and is a bit of a shortcoming.</p>
<p>The prices of Kunming "Yunnan Daily" and "Minguo Daily" when the reporter first arrived - in July of the 27th year (1938), were only 6 jiao (cents) per month in national currency for subscription, and 2 fen (cents) per copy for single sales. Later, it rose to 7 jiao. Due to the rising exchange rates and increased paper prices, "Minguo Daily," "Yunnan Daily," and "Zhaobao" jointly announced that from December 1st of the 27th year (1938), the prices would be raised uniformly. The subscription prices for "Minguo Daily," "Yishi Daily," and "Yunnan Daily" were 1 yuan per month, 5 yuan and 5 jiao for half a year, and 10 yuan and 5 jiao for the whole year, with retail prices of 4 fen per copy. However, "Zhaobao" alone, due to its smaller size, had a slightly more reasonable price, with 7 jiao and 5 fen per month, 3 yuan and 8 jiao for half a year, and 7 yuan and 5 jiao for the whole year, with a retail price of 2 fen and a half per copy. Postage is charged separately.</p>
<p>As for news agencies, there is only one local news agency, the "Yunnan News Agency," run by the provincial party headquarters, with its office inside the provincial party headquarters on Huashan South Road, with Chen Tingbi as the president and Gan Rutang as the editor. In addition to being used by local newspapers, many newspapers in other provinces also subscribe to its manuscripts. The agency has recently recruited stenographers and reporters, and is planning to improve and expand its operations. As I write this, I suddenly saw an advertisement for the establishment of a Kunming branch of the Central News Agency. The veteran reporters in the guerrilla area will have many opportunities to come to Yunnan and discuss with the reporters of the Yunnan News Agency. There is nothing to worry about. (Xiao Wenhu)</p>
<h3 id="e17">Guo Moruo's Speech on Wartime Cultural Work at a Forum for Cultural Figures in Chongqing <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Correspondence] The meeting room for the cultural forum was crowded with forty or fifty people, happily coming to listen to Mr. Guo Moruo's speech.</p>
<p>Zhang Shenfu, the chairman, first briefly introduced Mr. Guo's past efforts in the cultural field. Mr. Guo approached the podium with a smiling face.</p>
<p>After a few polite words, the main topic began. Mr. Guo said:</p>
<p>"Culture is progressive and develops forward with the evolution of mankind. Especially when it is combined with the war for freedom and peace, its progress is even more rapid. We all know that our current war of resistance is for the justice of mankind and can also be said to be for defending the progress of culture. Therefore, our culture has made rapid progress since the War of Resistance. On the * side, there is undoubtedly regression, because not only can he destroy our country's cultural construction, but his own domestic culture has also been regressing since the "September 18th Incident." Their thoughts are not free, their speech is not free, and it can be said that the entire culture is under white terror. In the past, they flaunted their "university freedom," but now "university freedom" has become a historical term. Since last July, nearly 10,000 writers have been forced to be slaves under the iron hooves of warlords.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Mr. Guo sighed deeply, resenting the demons in the world who hindered human culture. However, after a pause, he changed to a pleasant tone.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, our culture seemed to have not yet broken away from that "translation" state, that is, culture had no connection with general practical requirements. People returning from abroad, because what they learned was not what the general public needed, felt the pain of not using what they had learned, and cultural workers became increasingly alienated from practical requirements. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, this alienation has gradually disappeared. Due to practical requirements, many undertakings that should have been held many years ago were completed without people realizing it. For example, the opening of the Xiang-Gui Railway is a good example.</p>
<p>This good phenomenon excited everyone in the room. Then he talked about the question of "what should wartime cultural workers do?" He solemnly and slowly said:</p>
<p>"Because our War of Resistance is a war to defend culture, our wartime culture should be: domestically, how to enhance the people's strength to resist Japan? How to make the soldiers have a sense of common hatred? On the * side, how to disintegrate the * army? Internationally, how to win more support?"</p>
<p>"In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we have achieved considerable success in these three aspects," Mr. Guo listed such as the unity of the whole people, the bravery of the soldiers, the *'s anti-war, and the increasingly good international attitude towards us. All of these are the power of cultural workers.</p>
<p>"However," Mr. Guo continued, "in the first phase of the War of Resistance, our culture only moved from this city to that city. When the war on the Northeast battlefield was most intense, everyone put forward the slogan "cultural people move inward." Some people did it due to subjective efforts, and some people did it due to objective pressure. The inward movement of cultural people has made a great contribution to the development of wartime culture. However, up to the present stage, the cultural people are only still moving to the cities, and have not yet moved to the vast countryside. In the past, cultural people were mostly ambitious and unwilling to approach the common people with low cultural levels. Now, cultural people have lowered their heads held high, but what they do has not yet been truly popular."</p>
<p>He said very angrily that there are still many people who believe that once all works are "popularized," our culture will go bankrupt. He believes that this is nonsense, because it is useless to only close yourself in a room and shout "improve culture" without first improving the cultural level of the general public. Therefore, he advocated that "in the second phase of the War of Resistance, cultural people should move to the countryside, and their works should be absolutely "popularized." Then he cited the works of the painters in the Third Department of the Political Department, which did not attract the attention of the general public, and the newly produced anti-Japanese films, which also failed to make the common people understand. Although movies and paintings are good propaganda tools, "in the future, all works should be simple and clear, because the largest number of ignorant and ignorant old people are precisely our main force in the war, and the strong men who defend the motherland are also being conscripted among them."</p>
<p>"In addition to this, cultural people have another most important trend, that is, "cultural people should move to the * rear."</p>
<p>"The main strategy in the second phase is to open up a vast guerrilla area in the * rear."</p>
<p>He used the example of Wutai Mountain to prove the strength of guerrilla warfare in the * rear. He said that if we can establish ten guerrilla areas in the * rear like the two buildings in Wutai Mountain, the * will simply have no way to deal with it. According to Mr. Peng Dehuai's report, in Wutai Mountain, not only were three * divisions tied down, but three * divisions were simply annihilated." Such success, "he said loudly, "Is it possible to fight with force alone? No, in addition to force, the main thing is to mobilize the people and organize the people, and the responsibility of doing this work lies with the cultural people. Our cultural people, in order to actually help the war of resistance at present, should move to the * rear in large quantities and quickly establish a strong guerrilla zone."</p>
<p>He took a sip of tea, thought for a moment, and then said, "Our entire strategy is "protracted war," and "protracted war" depends on enriching the rear to maintain it. But how to enrich it? Then we need a large number of staff from the various production departments, so cultural people at this time also have the important task of encouraging young people to learn specialized skills."</p>
<p>He hated the fact that many selfish professors, in order to satisfy their own material needs or fear air raids, hid in safe areas. He believed that these people were only a piece of paper away from the traitors in Beiping. Therefore, he finally shouted loudly, "If we want to save the country, we must first learn the ability to save the country ourselves. Not only must we learn ourselves, but we must also teach young people the ability to save the country."</p>

<p>[Geneva, Central News Agency, 21st] Before leaving here to return to France, Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun told a Reuters reporter that the Executive Yuan's resolution stated, "We hereby invite all member states, especially those with direct relations with the Far East, and other countries with direct relations with the Far East, to consult and consider the suggestions made by Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun to the Executive Yuan on the 17th of this month, in order to take effective measures to assist China."

The remarks made by British representative Butter on the Executive Yuan are enough to indicate that the British government is prepared to provide financial assistance to China, which is very gratifying. The requests I made to the Executive Yuan on January 17th, including a ban on transporting aircraft and gasoline to Japan, have been notified to all member states by the League of Nations."</p>
<p>[Geneva, Reuters, 21st] Before the League of Nations Executive Yuan passed the resolution on China yesterday, French representative Chevalier expressed France's sympathy for China, saying that the French government is prepared to participate in all efforts to restore peace to China. New Zealand representative Jordan pointed out that 30 million people in China are currently trapped in hunger and cold. The Soviet representative said that he is very willing to support China's requests. British representative Butter said that he believes that the governments of all countries that sent representatives to Geneva deeply sympathize with China's suffering, and said that the British government has considered some of China's proposals since the last Executive Yuan meeting, and has carefully reviewed them, hoping to fulfill the expectations of the Chinese people when the situation permits.</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent, Central News Agency, Geneva, 21st] Before the Executive Yuan passed the resolution on the Chinese application yesterday morning, New Zealand representative Cho Tsun stood up and said, "I support the resolution, but the content seems too weak." The French representative said, "The French people deeply sympathize with the Chinese nation in this war. The Chinese people have fully demonstrated their heroic patriotism in this unprecedented catastrophe, and their heroic resistance to protect the independence of their motherland should arouse the admiration of people all over the world." In addition, the British and Soviet representatives also stood up to express their deep sympathy for the Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Important Speech by the U.S. President Regarding Authorization to Use Significant Funds for Improving Defense in Guam, and the Army's Intention to Increase Garrison in the Canal Zone <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] President Roosevelt stated, "I approve of the proposal to authorize the government to use five million dollars to build a naval base in Guam. However, it should be noted that the proposal only mentions 'authorization' and not 'appropriation.' According to the content of this proposal, it is planned to dredge the port of Guam, improve aircraft landing facilities, and build a new naval camp. It would be beneficial to the nation if the American press could explain the difference between 'Congressional authorization' and 'Congressional appropriation.' The commencement of defense projects requires Congressional appropriation. Furthermore, 'approving appropriation' does not necessarily mean starting construction immediately. Neither this Congress nor subsequent Congresses are obligated to transform 'authorization' into 'approval for actual payment of funds.' In practical terms, 'authorization' only represents what Congress desires or its aspirations, much like an individual making a 'New Year's resolution.' In recent years, Congress has authorized the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars, but many projects have not been implemented. According to the report of the 'Special Naval Committee,' there are many other plans related to the construction of a port in Guam, totaling six hundred million dollars. Currently, my concern is the actual needs of the nation, not long-term plans. I do not want to restrict myself or make any decisions, as international situations may change next year, potentially rendering today's plans obsolete." Someone specifically questioned President Roosevelt about his approval of the five million dollars for defense construction in Guam. He replied, "According to the Navy Department's estimates, one million dollars is needed in the next fiscal year to begin dredging the port of Guam, which I approve of. Furthermore, there have been no talks between the United States and Japan regarding the defense construction in Guam." It is noted that the Japanese press strongly opposes this, claiming it is detrimental to Japan's national defense. Some members of the U.S. Congress have also made criticisms. At the same time, Congressional leaders plan to pass the Naval Air Base Act as soon as possible. Chairman Vincent of the Naval Committee stated that public opinions could be heard openly starting next week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to authoritative sources here, the U.S. Army authorities advocate that the strength of the garrison in the Panama Canal Zone should be doubled from its current 13,000 troops.</p>
<p>Daily Newspapers Continue to Criticize the United States</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese criticism of the U.S.'s defense construction in Guam has not diminished. For example, the "Japan Times" stated, "If the meaning of this action by the United States is not to interfere in Chinese politics or to seek a voice in the political arena of East Asia, or even to promote its trade through the power of cannons, then building a new naval base near the coast of Japan will only disturb the peaceful situation." "Asahi Shimbun" quoted Borah's words, "This defense plan is the most provocative plan in the last fifty years." The United States wants to gain a foothold in the Pacific, but on one hand, it calls Japan an aggressor, and on the other hand, it is carrying out aggressive actions to resist Japan. It is now believed that U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson must have reported inaccurate information to Washington authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Reasons for Schacht's Resignation: Germany Keeps Secrets Strict, Business Figures in Washington believe it will have no practical impact on German-American commerce. <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] Today, the entire city of Berlin is actively trying to find out the reasons for Dr. Schacht's resignation as President of the National Bank. The secret is kept closely. Hitler met with Schacht today, thanking him for his loyal service to the country. Judging from Schacht's expression and attitude yesterday, there was nothing to prove that he foresaw today's events. On the contrary, according to information from well-informed sources obtained by this agency, the reorganization announced today was discussed in a cabinet meeting where Schacht was also present. All parties now deny that there will be any changes in Germany's finances and economy after the change of the head of the National Bank. Official circles firmly stated that the reason for this change is that the government hopes to unify the control of national finances and economy. The impact of this change on the Berlin market was better than expected. By the close of the market, the market situation was generally firm. Furthermore, there will be no change in the German government's attitude towards foreign debt (including Dawes and Young loans). Regarding the issue of Jewish resettlement, according to usually reliable sources, Schacht may still be responsible for negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Dr. Funk has been appointed as President of the German National Bank. A senior official here said, "This move is tantamount to giving the United States a slap in the face." Other officials also stated that Funk is "notorious for his anti-Americanism." However, business figures believe that Dr. Schacht's "dismissal" will have no practical impact on German-American commerce, as Schacht was merely a puppet, and Germany's actions have already been more than enough to damage its trade with the United States. However, according to general predictions, although Germany is trying its best to reduce purchases of American goods, it still cannot help but rely on the United States for various necessities such as cotton, kerosene, copper, lead, and sulfur ore, as these items are urgently needed by Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Schacht's dismissal has caused various speculations in diplomatic circles. "Commentary" reported that Schacht's dismissal was the result of a conflict between the radical and moderate factions of the National Socialist Party. On the other hand, it is believed that Schacht's departure is Hitler's deliberate demonstration to Britain that the moderate faction of the National Socialist Party has lost power. Also, Schacht's dismissal will leave a bad impression on British financial circles.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Britain Will Increase the Construction of Warships to Counter German Submarine Construction <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] This agency's naval correspondent stated, "Since Germany has announced its intention to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain, Britain's shipbuilding plans will inevitably increase warships sufficient to counter submarines, such as escort ships and patrol ships, all of which are included. In addition, the addition of destroyers is also not impossible. Among today's main issues, there must be the issue of equal rates proposed by Germany, but what is known so far is that the 'National Observer' recently stated that 'Germany will only gradually expand its submarines to be equal to Britain's strength.'"</p>
<h3 id="e23">Political Situation in Romania (Continued) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Fascists use the issue of ethnic minorities as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and as an excuse to demand the territory of other countries. According to the invasion plan set by Germany's Goering, the first item is "to attack Ukraine from Czechoslovakia and Romania." After the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia has already become a vassal of Germany, and now the flames of Fascism have successively burned to Romania. That country has abundant resources, such as oil, timber, herds, and food, and Hitler has long been eager to possess them. He wants to use Romania as a sacrifice to attack the Soviet Union, so Hitler pretends to be the protector of ethnic minorities in Romania and begins to weaken Romania's power. However, Carol goes against the tide and does not unite the various ethnic groups in the country under the principle of equality to protect the interests of the country. Instead, he goes astray and makes things difficult for ethnic minorities in the country, which is simply a policy of suicide.</p>
<p>The Romanian government's oppression of ethnic minorities stems from the suppression of the revolutionary upsurge of the working class and peasants against feudalism. The purpose is to shift the target of the masses' struggle. After the Goga cabinet was established, it followed Germany's lead in targeting Jews, wanting to shift the hatred of the working class for the ruling class to ethnic minorities. After Carol implemented monarchical dictatorship, he intensified his efforts and promulgated unilateral laws restricting their rights. He also appointed Țepelea, a member of the Iron Guard and a Fascist thug, as Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities.</p>
<p>Carol also fantasized and divided the country into ten regions, each with a royal supervisor. All administrative officials in the region were appointed and dismissed by the supervisor. Any group had to register with him. The supervisor also had the right to dissolve them. The supervisor of the Bessarabia region was a famous Fascist. Although the other supervisors had no party affiliation, they were all very reactionary.</p>
<p>Anti-Jewish Movement</p>
<p>Most of the land in Romania belongs to the landed gentry of Greek origin. The entire countryside is shrouded in feudal power. In order to save salt, the peasants kept the leftover vegetable soup from their meals to cook with next time, unwilling to throw it away. The hardship of their lives can be seen from this. The cultural level is very low. Illiteracy is widespread. They are also very superstitious and easily deceived. The peasants cannot bear the government's heavy taxes and levies and the landlords' exploitation, and class hatred is deepening. In order to avoid revolution, the rulers promoted the anti-Jewish movement to shift the direction of the peasants' struggle.</p>
<p>There are approximately 850,000 Jews in Romania, accounting for 5% of the country's population. The history is very long. There were Jewish immigrants as early as the time of Jesus. The number gradually increased in the 18th century, especially during and after the European War, when a large number of Jews moved to Romania. Their living habits, language, and writing have all been assimilated. Especially those who migrated from Spain in 1494 have almost assimilated everything. Jews have made great contributions to Romania's economic development and therefore occupy an important position in the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>According to Article 8 of the "Treaty for the Protection of Ethnic Minorities" signed by Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and Romania on December 9, 1919, "All people of Korea shall be equal regardless of race, language, or religion." Article 7 stipulates, "Jews residing in Romania, except those who already have other nationalities, shall be considered Romanian citizens." Romania also promised that if it violated the provisions of the treaty, members of the League of Nations could issue warnings. The League of Nations Council would take appropriate action. However, after Goga came to power, he took the lead in advocating the anti-Jewish movement.</p>
<p>The Goga government stipulated that Jews who became citizens after 1922 would have their citizenship revoked and would not be allowed to own land or sell government-patented products such as alcohol, tobacco, and matches. They were also not allowed to serve as newspaper editors.</p>
<p>The Fascist thugs in Bucharest used the Funset Palace as their headquarters, parading in groups and swaggering through the streets. They would insult anyone who looked like a Jew at will, and even tie them up and take them to Funset Palace for private torture and beatings. Dr. Blumenfeld, the editor-in-chief of the "Dimineața" newspaper, was kidnapped by Fascist thugs for advocating justice. He was imprisoned in this house and almost beaten to death.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 21st] It was announced here this morning that the French Chief of Staff originally intended to travel to North Africa with Navy Chief of Staff Darlan on Saturday and Sunday to inspect the fortresses of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. However, this plan was suddenly cancelled, and the reason is unknown. According to several French newspapers, the French Chief of Staff's inspection tour has been postponed to the end of next week. According to sources in political circles, the postponement may be related to the recent situation in the Spanish Civil War.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 20th] The autonomous government of Carpatho-Ukraine has severed diplomatic relations with the central government of Czechoslovakia because the Czechoslovak central government appointed General Prchala as a member of the autonomous government's cabinet.

Appointing a Czech person as a cabinet member of the autonomous government is a violation of the constitution and an "unjustified action" by the central government, causing unrest in Carpatho-Ukraine.</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Circumstances of the Shanghai Customs Being Punished! (Continued to the end) <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Shanghai) Zhi Ping</p>
<p>The Situation After the Agreement Was Concluded</p>
<p>1. Japanese Goods Imports Take the Top Spot. Since the outbreak of the war, foreign trade has been greatly affected, but it has gradually recovered. Taking Shanghai as an example, the import value of Japanese goods in June of the 27th year was only 200,000 yuan, which was insignificant. In July, it jumped to more than 4 million yuan, in August to more than 3 million yuan, in September to more than 4 million yuan, and in October to more than 5 million yuan, taking the top spot in imports. As for whether all goods entering and leaving Hongkou are fully taxed, it is still questionable.</p>
<p>Looking at the national figures, in January, the United States ranked first in imports with 11,569,000 yuan, and Japan ranked eighth with 2,440,000 yuan; in February, the United States ranked first with 18,024,000 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth with 6,023,000 yuan; in March, Germany ranked first with 19,062,000 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth with 10,227,000 yuan; in April, the United States ranked first with 13,245,000 yuan, and Japan ranked second with 10,240,000 yuan; in May, Japan ranked first with 15,361,000 yuan; in June, Japan ranked first with 18,372,000 yuan; in July, Japan ranked first with 19,701,000 yuan; in August, Japan ranked first with 23,825,000 yuan; in September, Japan ranked first with 24,755,000 yuan; and in October, Japan ranked first with 20,625,000 yuan (all figures in thousands of yuan).</p>
<p>2. Smuggled Goods Still Flooding In. Since the customs agreement was concluded, it was hoped that smuggling would decrease. However, according to reports, items such as wool fabrics, serge, rayon, soybean cake, matches, and canned fish daily necessities are still being smuggled in large quantities. Because no tariffs are paid, the selling price is often one-third lower than the market price, which has a significant impact on legitimate businesses. Furthermore, according to a report on October 8, although the Jianghai Customs has resumed anti-smuggling work in the East Shanghai area, it is often obstructed by military forces, making it impossible to strictly enforce the law. The practice of smuggling to evade taxes is still rampant. In the past week, the import of smuggled goods has been dominated by daily food products such as rice, white sugar, and salt. It is hoped that businesses will not import goods of unknown origin. From the above, it can be seen that smuggled goods are still very abundant.</p>
<p>3. Customs Forced to Fly Defunct Flag. During the customs agreement negotiations, the flag issue was a major sticking point. Relevant parties once indicated that the customs would no longer fly any flags as a passive compromise. However, on November 4, it was said that under the orders of the puppet organization and puppet officials, the five-colored flag, a defunct banner, was raised high on the roof of the Jianghai Customs Building and on all customs ships patrolling the Huangpu River, causing onlookers to frown and public opinion to be in an uproar, with people questioning the customs authorities. Afterwards, the defunct flag was hoisted several times. According to Inspector General of Customs Maze, he had not received a report on the flying of the defunct flag and had reported to the central authorities for instructions.</p>
<p>Failure of Seeking Cooperation with a Tiger</p>
<p>Regarding the customs agreement, some believe that it is an unavoidable temporary measure during wartime. Otherwise, the act of armed robbery might be unavoidable. The entire customs authority would fall into the hands of others, with them taking whatever they wanted. The principal and interest on various foreign debts secured by customs revenues would also not be guaranteed. Therefore, when the customs agreement was concluded, domestic and foreign public opinion, in addition to expressing regret and stating that China would reserve the right to free action, had little else to say. However, there are points that should be noted: the motivation for the agreement was to prevent smuggling, but smuggling continued as before, without any reduction, this is the first point; the British originally hoped to use the agreement to alleviate Japan's oppression of British commercial interests in China, but the opening of the Yangtze River was still refused, and British interests in China were even more harmed by constant concessions and damage, this is the second point; the customs revenue, in addition to paying foreign debts and indemnities, has a large surplus, which is deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, which may be used as × by the Japanese and puppet sides, and foreign newspapers have questioned the Japanese spokesman the day before yesterday as to whether the "Reformed Government" had withdrawn or borrowed funds from customs duties, and used customs duties as collateral, and the Japanese side avoided answering, this is the third point. Furthermore, the payment of foreign debts is to maintain our foreign credit, but since Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangdong have fallen one after another, the authority is no longer in our hands. Foreign reporters also asked the Japanese spokesman whether the customs surplus deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank would be used to pay foreign debts secured by customs duties, and the Japanese only used adjustments as a pretext. All of this was unexpected by the British. However, with the arrival of the incident, the Japanese merchants have also made great concessions, and the Shanghai Customs has agreed to the Japanese Shipping Company's request to use Japanese bills of lading and fill out Japanese inventory lists. This kind of additional example, with the bill of lading of one country's customs allowing the use of foreign languages, was originally abnormal, but now the texts of various countries, British and Japanese, are mixed together, which is even more unexpected. Do short-sighted politicians who are focused on reality and seek cooperation with a tiger hope to maintain their interests in the Far East?</p>
<p>A Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e33">Speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Arita gave a speech in the Diet yesterday, explaining Japan's future diplomatic policies. The important points are: (1) Japan is determined to implement the policy of forming a "Japan-Manchukuo-China Group" and establishing a "New Order in East Asia." Here, he fully explained that Japanese diplomacy is a tool of the Japanese warlords, and future policies are a manifestation of the intentions of the Japanese warlords. The so-called "hope that China will quickly establish a new central government" is to use diplomatic conspiracies as an auxiliary to promote the emergence of a new China, a pseudo-Manchukuo II, in the warlords' intentions. (2) He also stated that Japan is still determined to open China's doors, but it is necessary for Japan to impose considerable restrictions on matters related to national defense. This again illustrates Japan's intention to deceive countries such as Britain and the United States. However, the so-called considerable restrictions have no specific boundaries, and the narrowness of the "open door" under Japan's special permission can be imagined. Although Britain and the United States are tired of resisting, they will at least not be so foolish as to willingly be baited by this lure and serve the Japanese aggressors to boost their power. (3) He also stated: "Japan cannot remain silent on the fact that the Soviet Union and France are aiding China, and will take countermeasures against Vietnam becoming a gateway for China to obtain military supplies from abroad in order to retaliate." This is even more unreasonable intimidation of France and the Soviet Union, and it is in line with Germany's eastward advance and anti-French intentions. Unfortunately, this kind of intimidation is already too late. The Soviet Union is not afraid of intimidation, and China is even less like Czechoslovakia! In addition, Arita tirelessly called out the crisis of communism and loudly sang the praises of Asian anti-communism, almost forgetting the great event that made the world laugh at them, their recent submission to the red flag of Zhanggufeng! In short, Arita's declaration is not enough to make the powers feel interested, and it only increases the boredom of the people of the country. We cannot name it, so we call it "self-deception"!</p>
<h3 id="e34">Mr. Bosman's Advice <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Former students of the "Great Library," the predecessor of the University of Hong Kong, the highest institution of learning in the territory, held a reunion party the night before last. More than twenty Chinese and foreign alumni attended, the youngest of whom was seventy-one years old. Mr. Bosman even returned from afar to participate. In his speech, he highly praised the doctrine of his former classmate, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, commended Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's policy of uniting all parties in the country to persist in the war of resistance, and praised the progress of our country in recent years in terms of ideology and material construction. Finally, he pointed out the close relationship between Hong Kong and China's war of resistance, and called on foreign residents in Hong Kong to urgently donate to the victims of war and refugees. He said, "For British nationals, whose wealth comes from Hong Kong, I ask whether we are being loyal? At the same time, do we recognize China as a loyal ally? If so, then we should do our best to save China from the ravages of war. You are all advanced in age and living comfortably, but within the realm of possibility, you should not indulge yourselves too much, and should spare a thought for the refugees." The reader should reflect on this: if foreigners are so concerned about our national affairs, how much more should our wealthy compatriots in Hong Kong be? If foreigners firmly believe that the Three Principles of the People and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to persist in the war of resistance are the only path to China's victory, how should our compatriots regard those who advocate a truce, oppose communism, and criticize the Three Principles of the People? If a white-haired foreign old man is so concerned about our war-stricken refugees and warns against excessive indulgence, how much more should our young compatriots with wealth and strength redouble their efforts to support the war of resistance and rescue the refugees?</p>

<p>The American Commission to Celebrate Countries Not Participating in Japanese Aggression has been established under the leadership of Mr. Stimson. In the future, it will strive to completely ban the import of military or auxiliary military equipment into Japan. The establishment of this commission fully demonstrates the pain and resentment of peace-loving and righteous people in the United States towards the expansion of the aggressor Japan's war and the harm to mankind, and fully expresses their pain and resentment towards the direct or indirect assistance of a small number of industrialists and businessmen in the United States to Japan's aggression. At the same time, it will be of considerable significance in helping our heroic war of resistance against Japanese fascist aggression. We should launch Chinese and foreign public opinion to enthusiastically support this action of international peace-loving and righteous people, which is in line with the requirements of the progress of human culture. We should call on other democratic countries and their peoples around the world who demand peace and freedom to quickly establish such mass organizations to oppose fascist aggression and stop the spread of the great war during this new era of imperialist war, universally develop the mass movement against fascist aggression war throughout the world, and at the same time strive to unite this movement to become an irresistible force.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, Points Out: Hong Kong's Relationship with China is Extremely Close; Hong Kong's Fortune is Closely Related to China's Fortune; Hoping for an Early End to the Conflict in the Pacific to Bring Peace to Hong Kong <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, recently published an article in the British "Imperial Colony" entitled "The Position of the Colony of Hong Kong in the Pacific." He gave a detailed account of the improvements and construction of Hong Kong's municipal administration. He stated that in the coming years, Hong Kong will undergo improvements in scale and magnificent construction. Regarding the issue of densely populated areas, the government is currently reviewing various administrative measures to seek improvements. A new agency has been added to handle labor affairs and protect the well-being of workers. The current efforts are to develop education and health administration, and there is also an urgent implementation to protect the well-being of women and children of a certain class. The article specifically mentioned that Hong Kong will hold its centenary celebration in 1941, hoping that by then, the conflicts in the Pacific will come to an end, allowing Hong Kong to live and work in peace with its friendly countries.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Close Relationship with China</p>
<p>The Governor pointed out that Hong Kong's fortune is closely related to the happiness of its great neighbor. China's relationship with Hong Kong is particularly close during this difficult and arduous time. Many goods are imported from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland, and at the same time, the number of people fleeing to Hong Kong has suddenly increased, causing difficulties for the original residents, especially the poor. Due to the soaring rents and rising prices, the cost of living is high, and the government has made it a matter of urgency to legislate to restrict this. Due to the sudden increase in population, the supply of housing cannot meet the demand, and every corner is crowded. However, there are still many people living on the streets, and the government has taken measures to resettle them.</p>
<p>The Aviation Development Has a Bright Future</p>
<p>Continuing on the development of Hong Kong's civil aviation industry, he briefly stated that due to the rapid development of Hong Kong's civil aviation industry, Hong Kong's commerce will have a promising future. Although affected by the war, the civil aviation traffic in the first seven months of 1938 exceeded the entire year of 1937, with 4,024 more passengers, 157 tons more cargo and mail, and 101 more flights. Its future is limitless.</p>
<p>T Industry Manufacturing is Well-Known in the Far East</p>
<p>Hong Kong, including the New Territories leased land, has an area of only 400 square miles. It is not possible to expect too much in terms of raw material production, but Hong Kong has become the base for many kinds of industries. Shipbuilding is famous in the Far East, and it is the most famous. Most of Hong Kong's industry manufactures low-priced goods that are suitable for consumption by the poor in various ports, especially in the dependencies under the empire. These goods can obtain preferential import duties in accordance with the imperial preferential tax regulations. Hong Kong has a pleasant climate and excellent scenery, making it a popular destination for escaping the cold. It has comfortable hotels, horse racing and other sports facilities, everything is available.</p>
<p>Economic Fluctuations are Frequently Affected</p>
<p>The world is rarely matched. Finally, the economic rise and fall of Hong Kong is discussed, which is often affected by external factors. As an import and export trading port, its prosperity follows the world's economic situation, and it is also subject to the destruction of nature. The two typhoons in 1936 and 1937 caused losses of 1.5 million to the Hong Kong government alone, and the losses of private property, shipping, and industry were even greater. On July 19, 1926, heavy rain of 21 inches fell within 24 hours, causing great damage to various buildings, and the repair costs reached several million dollars. Despite these setbacks, Hong Kong has completed various major projects in the past few years, and is still pushing forward. In the coming years, it is hoped that the various major buildings will be completed with income from the public treasury. However, Hong Kong's most difficult problem is that on the one hand, there is very little land for construction, and land needs to be reclaimed from the sea; on the other hand, the population is increasing rapidly, resulting in extreme population density and great difficulty in housing. Efforts are being made to solve this problem.</p>

<p>The Kowloon Motor Bus Company previously ordered a batch of double-decker buses from the United Kingdom, intending to use them to run on various lines in the Peninsula. After testing on Nathan Road, it was found that the trees and street lights on both sides of the road were obstructing the passage, so it was delayed. The company has now obtained the consent of the transportation authorities and the Director of Parks to cut down the trees on both sides of Nathan Road, raise the street lights crossing the sky, and order the removal of store signs that are too low, so as to ensure unobstructed passage. After testing on Nathan Road again, they were satisfied, so double-decker buses will be discovered in the Peninsula in the shortest possible time. It is reported that the company will temporarily use four buses to run on routes 1, 2, and 6, with separate first and second class fares.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong air defense authorities are paying close attention to the training of the public in wartime and have already implemented the wartime public air defense service plan, organizing air defense instructors, appointing area air defense committees, and training wartime service personnel. The organization plan is to prepare 6,000 instructors, of which 2,000 are planned to be filled by women. The recruitment of Chinese and Western women in Hong Kong has now begun. According to Air Defense Commissioner Steel Perkins, speaking to reporters yesterday, it has been proven in the World War that women do have the same courage and魄力 as men. We especially encourage women in Hong Kong to automatically participate in the service. Each of the 2,000 air defense stations in Hong Kong will have three instructors. We hope that one of the three will be a woman. Although there is no age limit for instructors, it is still most appropriate for those over 30 years old. There is absolutely no restriction on the nationality of the instructors. Twenty-two sub-district committees have now been established in Hong Kong, and the training of air defense instructors is also proceeding smoothly. 800 male and female instructors have already signed up to participate in the service, and there are 8 instructors in charge of training. It is believed that the air defense committees in each district will be able to recruit instructors in the short term, and it is believed that 6,000 people will be obtained. In addition, in order to enhance the sea defense in the Far East, the British naval authorities have not only increased the deployment of powerful cruisers to Hong Kong, but have also recently sent personnel to blockade engineering ships, one named the Balia, stationed in Singapore, and one named the Baran, stationed in Hong Kong. The former arrived in Singapore last year, and the latter also arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. After a brief trial, it was handed over to the Hong Kong Naval Department. It is reported that the sole mission of this warship is to lay iron wire nets and other blockade work, specializing in defense, and is called an interception defense ship. The equipment is quite new and is the first to be seen in Hong Kong. In addition, the new British naval transport ship, the Austria, will carry a batch of naval personnel to Hong Kong in March.</p>

<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Comprehensive Education in the War of Resistance at the Cadre Training Class of the China Arts Association</p>
<p>Although it was a cold night with a biting north wind, the hearts of a group of young people who were thirsty for knowledge were burning like a raging fire. They put on heavy winter clothes and walked eagerly across the cold and deserted roads, stepping into the Cadre Training Class of the China Arts Association, which was full of warmth, to listen to Mr. Tao Xingzhi's lecture.</p>
<p>A large classroom was already full. After a thunderous applause, Mr. Tao calmly and peacefully began his speech:</p>
<p>"Today is the opening day of the Cadre Training Class of the Hong Kong China Arts Association; I am very happy to be able to participate in this grand event. I was also very pleased to see the many important issues you want to explore. Now, the topic I want to talk about is the one you agreed upon, "Wartime Education"."</p>
<p>After a brief introduction, Mr. Tao began to talk about the topic:</p>
<p>"After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there are still people who do not recognize "Wartime Education". When I was overseas, I heard the president of a certain university express his "high opinion", saying that he had never studied wartime education and did not know how to do it. Then, he used the banner of "a century-old plan" to cover up.</p>
<p>In fact, this is obvious: now Japanese imperialism has already turned China into a wartime China. All our lives and activities should be suitable for the needs of wartime. No one can dodge, and education is of course no exception.</p>
<p>If the president of a certain school does not run wartime education and does not study wartime education, he should resign, otherwise he will sit and eat the country's salary. It's really a joke!</p>
<p>I strongly disagree with his opinion, so I wrote a poem to reply to him:</p>
<p>"Plague spreads everywhere,</p>
<p>Mom is lying in bed sick.</p>
<p>Asking him to pour a cup of water, he says he is busy with homework.</p>
<p>Asking him to call a doctor, he says he is busy with homework.</p>
<p>Asking him to buy a dose of medicine, he says he is busy with homework.</p>
<p>Until mom dies,</p>
<p>He is busy writing an obituary;</p>
<p>Busy writing a eulogy;</p>
<p>Busy being an orphan."</p>
<p>Causing the whole audience to burst into laughter. Mr. Tao said again with hatred for evil:</p>
<p>"Even now, there are still people who are educating for the sake of education, teachers are teaching dead books, teaching dead, and teaching books dead. Students are reading dead books, reading dead, and reading books dead.</p>
<p>——Another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>"They are doing peacetime education, living their detached lives under the banner of "a century-old plan". They don't care how painful and dangerous our mother - the Chinese nation - is. Until mom dies, he will be busy writing an obituary, busy being an orphan.</p>
<p>After Mr. Tao severely criticized the negative "peacetime education", he turned to the positive topic:</p>
<p>"The second phase of the War of Resistance is a comprehensive war of resistance, and the requirement for education is comprehensive education. The meaning of comprehensive education is to expand education to our front and the enemy's rear, and even to the entire world, so that the whole world can be awakened to expand the anti-aggression movement. This is in terms of space. In terms of object, education is not the patent of a few young masters and young ladies, those who have money, leisure, and face. It should be expanded to all young people, all children, all adults, all old people, and even all old women.</p>
<p>Maybe some people will say: What is the use of children and old women? In fact, if the children are like the children's singing troupe in Taierzhuang, turning the traitor surnamed Huang into a small soldier - the child surnamed Huang was deceived by the enemy and became a small traitor. Because he was moved by the children's propaganda team, he raised his hand to repent of his experience as a traitor. And he reported to our army about the enemy's situation, and as a result, he destroyed the enemy's arsenal, guns, etc., and changed from a small traitor to a small soldier - the power of the old women can increase many times if they are like Zhao's mother. Therefore, education should be expanded to the ranks of children and old women, and expanded to the entire nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao paused slightly after talking about this passage, and then continued to talk about how comprehensive education should be done with great enthusiasm:</p>
<p>"Wherever a group occurs in wartime, education should be expanded there.</p>
<p>When there are wounded soldiers in wartime, education should go to the wounded soldiers. If there are five hundred wounded soldiers' hospitals, they should be run as five hundred wounded soldiers' schools. The adverse effects of the wounded soldiers not being educated are unimaginable. The power generated by the wounded soldiers being educated is very grand. They can influence the public in the local area and affect the morale in the front. This is an obvious truth.</p>
<p>When there are refugees in wartime, education should go to the refugees, so that the consumed relief becomes a productive force. When troops are conscripted in wartime, education should go to the ranks of the strong men, so that all the strong men will enthusiastically serve as soldiers and enthusiastically join the army, making our source of soldiers inexhaustible and inexhaustible. This is also a very important question.</p>
<p>Not only that, we must also expand education to the enemy's rear, so that the puppet regime cannot be established, the anti-war movement in Japan is strengthened, and it is expanded to the whole world, so that international assistance will become increasingly accumulated.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Comedy Musings <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Youyi</p>
<p>Recently, the film market seems to be running out of folk tales. The release of erotic and sensual films like "A Bath" and "Teasing Eyes," as well as terrifying works resembling "playing the pig to scare the tiger," has not proven to be popular. Therefore, some clever filmmakers are scratching their heads and, with a plan in mind, are using comedies with titles like "Laugh to Death" as a selling point. In reality, whether a film is a box office success, in other words, whether it can attract a large audience, is entirely a matter of its intrinsic qualities, unrelated to its form. Empty content and poorly made works, no matter how you promote them, can only deceive the audience temporarily. As for those toxic films that violate the spirit of the times or spread messages that weaken the resistance against Japan, they will naturally be despised and rejected! On the contrary, a work with correct ideology and mature artistry, whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, a romance or a detective story, will be equally welcomed, and there is no need to worry about it "going out of style." Theatergoers are the most amiable customers; they only want good things and fundamentally have no preconceived notions about what kind of plays should be shown at any given time. If you can further adopt themes that are closely related to them and nurture them through art and skill, then that is the "infallible method" for "unfailing success." They will absolutely not make demanding requests to use a particular dramatic form to express a line of agreeable thought. The so-called "what they wanted in the past is not what viewers want now" perspective is simply "smashing a mirror with your head," unable to see one's own shortcomings. We should get to the point. Let us assume the "current film market will be dominated by comedies" is a misconception and discuss comedy to provide some reference for producers and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Comedy, according to its literal definition, is a drama that evokes laughter. However, because it belongs to drama, a branch of literature, and especially film, considered a comprehensive art, the achievement of comedy should not be as simple as "purely aiming to evoke laughter." We should imbue it with life and greater effect, so that the emotions of the audience are not limited to just laughter. Here is a brief list of the categories of comedy:</p>
<p>Slapstick Comedy: This is a type of comedy that cannot be said to have life or a greater effect and is the lowest quality of comedy. The plot can be strung together haphazardly, the jokes can be cobbled together, there is no need for ideology or to consider the content. It is almost a mess, a chaotic hodgepodge. As long as you think that "men getting pregnant" and "turtles growing wings" are the most hilarious storylines, feel free to use them as much as you like! "Torn pants" and "crazy antics" are unprecedentedly funny jokes; just insert them in large quantities. In any case, the only purpose is to deliberately force the audience to laugh while watching, without needing to conform to physics or human nature, not caring whether there is any aftertaste or impression. Of course, it also disregards the disgust and contempt of knowledgeable people and more progressive audiences. The works of Western actors like Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Brothers are the authentic representatives of this type of comedy. Most of the so-called "comedies" in Chinese films follow this shallow and boring path.</p>
<p>Light Comedy: This is a middle-grade comedy. It requires a more complete story, but it is often fantastical. It also needs reasonable jokes, vaguely has a shadow of life, and the effect seems to be more than just laughter. The screenwriter, director, actors, and all other personnel involved in this type of production must do their utmost to show off their cleverness, focusing on developing humor and wit from small details, with the aim of scratching the audience's itch and making them feel relaxed and happy while watching. American productions excel in this style, and Ernst Lubitsch is considered a master of this art.</p>
<p>Satirical Comedy: This is a high-grade comedy, with substance and a special effect. Perhaps the plot on the surface is not necessarily close to human nature, but it must target certain, or multiple, behaviors of society or life and subject them to sharp, exaggerated, and unforgiving satire. Although the performance uses the form of comedy, its effect can give the audience unexpected warnings and leave a deep impression. Even those being satirized in the audience will laugh at first, but after realizing the truth, they will feel as if they have thorns in their backs. This type of comedy is not easy to create from beginning to end in one go. Charlie Chaplin often incorporated some or a large portion of satirical material into his works, and Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" achieved 80% success. The only complete one the author has seen is the Soviet production "The Marionettes."</p>
<p>Between middle-grade and high-grade, we can also find a type of tragic comedy. This naming seems very contradictory, but the reason for its success as a middle-to-high or high-grade drama lies in its contradiction. It is not surprising for a tragedy to make you cry, but it is great if a comedy can also move you to tears. The reason why Charlie Chaplin still firmly occupies the throne of comedy and has the largest audience is that most of his works have tragic content but are performed as comedies. From silent films like "Shoulder Arms" and "The Kid" to more recent ones like "City Lights" and "Modern Times," they are all bitter and realistic stories expressed in a humorous way. He makes you laugh, laugh heartily, but if you are not numb and can reflect a bit after laughing, you cannot help but pity the fate of the poor man in the play, and even shed a tear of sympathy for him. In this way, its effect and impression are naturally more circuitous and powerful than a direct tragedy, and is its life not more vibrant and active than some other superficial comedies?</p>
<p>The musings about comedy provided here are only this meager, but they can勉强算得上 "the sparrow may be small but has all vital organs. " It is hoped that filmmakers and viewers who are interested in comedy will expand their vision from this small point and determine their attitude towards production and appreciation, striving to ensure that it is not a waste of resources and time.</p>

<h3 id="e48">"The Newly Appointed Magistrate" and "Beside Oneself" <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Jia</p>
<p>Performances by the Era Drama Troupe and the China Art Drama Troupe</p>
<p>Play Review</p>
<p>Two months ago, a script caught the attention of Hong Kong drama troupes and was simultaneously rehearsed: "Beside Oneself" by the China Art Drama Troupe and "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" by the Era Drama Troupe. Although the names are different, it is actually the same script. The China Art Drama Troupe performed it in Mandarin, while the Era Drama Troupe performed it in Cantonese. Both troupes belong to the Hong Kong Drama Movement Center and are directed by Mr. Mo Yang Yuqian, so the performance results can certainly be trusted.</p>
<p>The Era Drama Troupe's "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" went to Macau for a charity performance in mid-May and premiered on the 15th. The author has already seen it. The China Art Drama Troupe's "Beside Oneself" was also staged at the Central Theatre in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. The author has seen it as well. If we put these two performances together and talk about them, I think it would be very meaningful.</p>
<p>The script is the soul of the play. With a soul, plus the means of arrangement (director), a body with flesh and blood is produced. With the same script, and then processed by the same director, the same things should appear, right? But wonderfully, after seeing these two performances, they gave me different feelings and different interests. The China Art Drama Troupe's "Beside Oneself" is heavy and silent, while the Era Drama Troupe's "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" is light and flowing. The former is closer to tragedy, and the latter is a comedy. The performance methods are the same, the composition of the stage, and the position of the actors are also not very different, but the style of performance has such differences, probably because these two groups have different styles.</p>
<p>Originally, this play exposes the various ugly states of a group of rogue thugs who accidentally become successful at a certain opportunity, and at the same time shows the misery of the common people under the dark forces who are ruined and killed. The first half is comedy, and the second half is tragedy, forming a very serious contrast. The more powerful this contrast is, the greater the effect. If the comedic parts are performed heavily, and the tragic parts are performed frivolously, they are all failures. "Beside Oneself's"</p>
<p>The first two acts committed the mistake of being heavy and silent. The actors did not fully express the "得意 (beside oneself)" parts, nor did they express the "忘形 (forgetting one's place)" state. In terms of stage design, the use of clean-lined scenery and yellow-toned lighting made the first half of the play seem peaceful and quiet. Using such a posture to perform this group of ugly people is undoubtedly insufficient. "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" was performed very lightly and lively in the first half, using exaggerated movements to strengthen the comedic elements, making people feel that this group of nouveaux riches are both ridiculous and pitiful. Looking at the two performances, "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" was relatively more successful, with a greater audience response, and it was able to express the original meaning of the script.</p>
<p>A play with the first half being a comedy and the second half being a tragedy is the most difficult to act. If done poorly, it is easy to turn into two unconnected pieces. Experienced actors know to be careful in this area. The second half of "Beside Oneself" continues from the first half, maintaining the heavy and silent atmosphere, so the effect of the third act is very good, but it is slightly too long. This responsibility should be borne by the playwright and has nothing to do with those who acted it out. The China Art Drama Troupe's acting is strong in stability and is most suitable for performing the third act of this drama. It is a pity that Miss Tong, who plays Little Silver Brother, did not get to show her strengths, which is a fly in the ointment. "The Newly Appointed Magistrate's" second half also developed the atmosphere from the first half, so it was slightly more flowing. However, this also has its advantages. I remember that when it came to the third act, many audience members were moved to tears. I was moved to tears, perhaps because the tragedy of the Xu family touched my heart about the destruction of my family.</p>
<p>The difference between these two performances is certainly due to the different styles of the individual groups. At the same time, I feel that the difference in dialects is also an important reason. Cantonese people are not as compliant as people from other provinces, and people from other provinces are not as lively as Cantonese people. To put it bluntly, they are not as "slippery." Performing comedy is more suitable for Cantonese people. For example, for plays like "The Paint Isn't Dry," northerners are not as good as Cantonese people in performing it lively. There are many subtleties in Cantonese slang that Mandarin does not have, especially in the lower classes. For example, the phrase "他媽的 (his mother's)," which is often used in the play's lines, is far less direct and effective than "×那媽." "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" often uses a lot of slang from the lower classes, which is both fluent and natural, and is perfect for the personalities of those thugs who have risen to power and become successful. This is a big reason why "The Newly Appointed Magistrate" has a good effect.</p>

<p>2.  Organizers of Drama Performances A. The Director's Task</p>
<p>There used to be a film called "42nd Street" that wrote about a director who painstakingly rehearsed a play, and on the day of the performance, it was indeed a huge success. However, as he sat at the entrance, listening to the audience's criticisms, they only praised the actors, completely forgetting about the director. He was very sad!</p>
<p>That's right, this is the director's sadness. When the drama completes its rehearsal process and is performed on stage, the director is not involved in the direct connection between the artist and the art-appreciating social class.</p>
<p>When the art of drama is carried out on stage in its most complete and concrete creation, although the director is rejected, this complete creation can be said to be the director's hard work.</p>
<p>The art of drama is a comprehensive art, and the person who independently, artistically, organically unites and organizes the various departments is the director. Therefore, the director is the organizer of the drama performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a director, he must not only have literary accomplishment to understand the script, but he must also know art, stage design, acting theory, music, dance... all stage techniques; because the director is not only an organizer of the drama performance, but also a conductor of the group, just like a conductor of an orchestra.</p>
<p>The most important thing for the success of a drama performance is neatness and perfection, so the creation of the art of drama should be carried out under a unified will and a unified purpose, and the director's greatest task is to stand between the playwright and the creative group of the theater to unify the creative will of all the group members. The so-called directing technique is to connect the art of the playwright with the performance of the actors and give it limitations; the director explains to the actors and other artists the themes and image system given by the playwright; the director's creative materials are the art of the actors, composers, designers, etc., the creative intentions of the drama, the plans and forms of the drama performance, etc., which are mostly the power of the director.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the art of drama seems to be only the self-expression of the director, but this view is wrong. The director does not use drama to express his own creative personality, but to propose important issues in life to solve them—this is the mission of drama. And the solution of the problem. The group is equally responsible, and the artists of each actor and each department should maximize the independence of their own creative will. Drama is not a tool for the director to show off his cleverness. If the director's art goes beyond the drama and oppresses the creative will of other artists, the drama will not exist, and we will only come into contact with one of the elements of the drama, the isolated art of the director. Moreover, sacrificing many opinions in order to cater to the director's personal opinions and forcing the artists to engage in involuntary artistic creation violates the principles of artistic creation and makes creation impossible. Therefore, the director's work, his responsibility, is not to force the group to belong to himself, to make it a lifeless tool that has lost its creative will, but to give inspiration to all creative parties in the theater. To organize them and encourage them to ask the greatest creative will and enthusiasm to complete the entire perfect creation of the art of drama.</p>
<p>The art of drama can be said to be a diverse unity, and the greatest task of the director is not to make everything belong to himself, but to collect these diverse artistic departments, each with its own independence, and the creative will of each artist, and adjust, criticize, measure, and comprehensively organize them by artistic means, so that they become a general goal, a unified will, an organic whole, and a great creation. The director's task lies in this, neither too little nor too much. If you can achieve this step, then the entire perfect success of the drama performance is undoubtedly. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Economic Column</p>
<h3 id="e51">This Year, Finance Becomes More Stable, Developing the Economy of the Rear (Part 2), The International Balance of Payments Situation Sees Further Improvement, Funds Flow into the Mainland to Assist Development <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Encouraging Movement Inward, Funds Flowing In</p>
<p>After the war, funds flowed into cities, and with the regulation of public and private financial institutions, funds became more abundant. The interest rates in various places remained unchanged throughout the year. The interbank lending rate of the city's money industry association fell to 1.1 cents at the end of the year. Although wartime reduced the opportunities for capital utilization, it was also a reason for the constant interest rate to tend to fall. However, elsewhere, it was also a manifestation of financial stability and stable prices, and also a powerful testimony to the constant value of currency. However, the government has been working hard to make funds flow into the mainland to develop the economy of the rear and enrich national power, so it encourages the movement of banks inward. For example, the number of bank headquarters and branches in the six southwestern provinces has reached 120.</p>
<p>The International Balance of Payments Tends to Improve</p>
<p>After the Trade Commission made efforts to rectify my country's international trade, the months of June, July, August, and September of last year actually turned into a trade surplus. In the long term, the trade deficit for the first ten months of the 26th year was 117,750,125 yuan, while in the same period of the 27th year, the trade deficit was 111,101,442 yuan, which proves the success of my country's controlled trade. The increase in remittances from overseas Chinese is very large, and it is said that it totaled 600 million yuan last year, which is double the increase compared with previous years, which is enough to offset the trade deficit of goods and have a surplus. Recently, since the success of the British and American credit loans, the inflow of foreign capital into my country's international balance of payments has tended to improve.</p>
<p>Maintaining Legal Exchange Rates From Beginning to End</p>
<p>In order to stabilize foreign exchange, the Central Bank, China Bank, and Communications Bank have always maintained statutory prices. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly attempted to disrupt, such as taking foreign exchange from the United Notes and reducing the value of currency in North China, all plans have ultimately failed. The issuance of Chinese legal currency has increased unabated, and it has gained the trust of the people. It circulates naturally and has a premium rate. The exchange rate on the open market has always stood at 8 pence and zero. People's confidence in my country's currency has been completely restored. The near and far price differences of foreign exchange have also gradually disappeared. Many of my country's capital funds have recovered their funds invested in foreign exchange. Half of this is because they fear that the exchange rate will always rise and lose the opportunity to profit, and half is because the investment funds actually have more favorable places than foreign exchange.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Today's Big Soccer Match: Li Wah Cup, Chinese United Takes the Field, Clash with the Naval Combined Team at the Hong Kong Stadium <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Excellent soccer matches are numerous this season. Today is the second act of the Li Wah Cup preliminary round, with Chinese United facing Naval Combined. Both teams are renowned, with outstanding skills. They will put on a great show that will captivate soccer fans.</p>
<p>To meet the requirements of the Association, Chinese United selected and re-selected before determining their lineup. Li Huitang was also invited to participate and reluctantly agreed. Li Huitang's foot injury has not fully healed, and he has also gained weight due to stopping training for half a month after the injury. He is participating this time to alleviate the Association's dissatisfaction with South China's breach of contract. It is out of enthusiasm, without regard for other considerations. Therefore, he himself is not confident whether his performance will be satisfactory.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this lineup of Chinese United is evenly matched against Naval Combined. It is bound to be a difficult and closely contested match. The outcome is unpredictable. If we rashly conclude that Chinese United will lose, it would be demoralizing. If we insist that Chinese United will win, we cannot be so sure. In short, the facts after the match will be clear.</p>
<p>It is said that Song Lisheng's foot injury has not fully recovered and he will not be playing. If that is the case, Liu Shidu should replace him. As for Luo Weiquan's position, it should not be changed under any circumstances. At the same time, I hope that those players who are new to big matches will play boldly and not be timid.</p>
<p>It is also said that Hou Chengtou is also having problems, If he is also absent, the forward line will be significantly affected. In that case, as a last resort, Huang Jingcong is a suitable substitute.</p>
<p>The Art of War says, "Move after careful consideration; one who knows the plans of indirect and direct approach will win." Soccer matches are similar to the art of war. Especially today, Chinese United must pay attention to strategy. First, they should carefully observe the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, attack where they must go, and go where they do not expect it. This is called seizing the initiative. Second, they should take advantage of their own team's strengths, assess the situation and act, and advance and retreat according to the situation. This is called measuring the enemy to achieve victory.</p>
<p>With Li Huitang as the center forward, they must adopt the "conical attack" method. But the two inside forwards on the left and right must provide Huitang with sufficient support at all times. They can also use the wings to attack from the sides, drawing in the opponent's defenders so that they cannot gather their strength to counter the conical attack from the flanks, which will make it easier to achieve results.</p>
<p>Chen Bingtu should pay attention to short passes. It is not enough to simply cross the ball into the center and be done with it. Short passes and crosses must also be timely, otherwise it will be in vain. Therefore, my suggestion is that Bingshi should take advantage of the situation and attack quickly, while Chengtou should use his intelligence to lure the enemy. Although the strategy is not fixed, it must be adapted to the situation. However, to make it easier for Huitang's conical attack to progress, it is better to often use flank attacks to lure the enemy and control their counterattacks from the center.</p>
<p>This time, Chinese United strengthened its forward line, which is the unique insight of the selection committee. The question of whether Chinese United wins today depends on how the three forwards perform. If Lingsheng is not absent, this line will be strong and will have a solid foundation for advancing and retreating. But even if Lingsheng is replaced by Shizan, it will not affect the overall situation. I have faith in this line's ability to launch attacks and assist the defense.</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng and Weiquan have a heavy responsibility for defense, but the most important thing is to contain the two wings of Naval Combined. The interconnectedness of the three forwards is also their natural responsibility. Therefore, taking care of the inside defense is their most important task in this match.</p>
<p>The Naval Combined team excels in short passes and speed, especially on the wings, and their defensive strength is also not weak. Therefore, how to win depends on the efforts of the Chinese United players.</p>
<p>Finally, a word to the fans: if you want to see a good show, please arrive early. But please do not bring small "kai" (knives). Also, do not buy tickets sold outside the stadium for profit. Each spectator may purchase no more than three tickets. Once the seats are full, ticket sales will stop. The battleground is the Hong Kong Stadium. The match starts at 3:30 PM. The lineups of the two teams are as follows (Football Field God):</p>
<p>Chinese United</p>
<p>Tan Junqian, Luo Weiquan, Hou Rongsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liang Rongzhao, Song Lingsheng, Hou Chengtou, Luo Wenzhi, Li Huitang, Zhuo Shijin, Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>Substitutes: Li Deqi, Miao Huaguo, Liu Shizan, Liu Xianhan, Zeng Zhongyun, Wu Qixiang, Yang Zixiang, Zhong Lin, Huang Jingcong</p>

<h3 id="e56">Guanghua Courageously Defeats St. Joseph's <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's soccer matches, due to the influence of the Li Wah Cup Western Civil Servants vs. Army Combined match, most of the original schedule was changed. Only one match was held in the First Division League. Guanghua faced St. Joseph's in their first match. After a hard-fought battle, Guanghua won. Yesterday's match, because both teams had given up hope for the championship, the outcome was not enough to shake up the overall situation. St. Joseph's defeat was due to an abnormal performance. The team's offensive strength lies in the two wings, but yesterday they were restrained by Guanghua's defenders and could not move an inch. There was no opportunity to cross the ball into the center. Li An'na was brave, but could not get support, so he had no chance to show his skills. The five defenders in the back were quite willing to work hard, but their coordination was not tight and their movements were slow, so they could not stop the enemy forwards. On the Guanghua side, Wenzhi and Shijin performed wonderfully and deserve the most credit. The forwards made good use of the wings and did not easily hold onto the ball, making it difficult for Joseph's defenders to cope. The two goals scored by Shijin were due to taking advantage of Sousa's mistakes and cutting in to score. The defender Rongsheng performed better, being wise and decisive, and saving many dangerous situations. Guoqi's goalkeeping skills are improving rapidly and he will become a great player in the future. The battle situation is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At the start of the game, An'na led the two wings to advance in the center. As soon as they reached the 30-yard area, they were tackled by Huilin, who followed through and sent it further. Guanghua's dragon fight was surrounded, and the first alarm was sounded. Fortunately, Rongsheng was the bravest of the three armies, breaking through the heavy defenses and opening a path of blood. Shijin took the opportunity to counterattack. Qian and Zou lost twice, supporting each other from left and right, and advancing straight with short passes. Sousa blocked the way, heavy doors and deep soup, this route was impassable. Jingcong changed to infiltrating from the border pass, probing a few steps, and cutting the ball into the center field. The ball's trajectory was low and rapid. Wenzhi had already been lying in wait, without any hesitation, he shot at the goal. Ma Guishi faced the red sun, his vision was unclear, and he could not rescue it in time, unexpectedly suffering a loss first. The creation of this goal was no more than five minutes from the start of the game, which can be described as extremely fast. Starting from the center circle again, the St. Joseph's team was not discouraged despite being ambushed, and tried their best to counterattack in order to wash away their shame. So they came and went, fighting hard. Zixiang monitored An'na, inevitably becoming lax, and the center was repeatedly broken through, turning the hinterland into a city full of storms, where every blade of grass seemed an enemy soldier. Soon after, An'na sent a long pass, Wodi flashed in, and vigorously kicked it in front of the goal. At that time, Guanghua's rear was empty, and only Guoqi was guarding it alone. The situation had become very dangerous. Many fans expected Guanghua to be unable to escape this calamity. Fortunately, Guoqi was aware of the situation and abandoned his position to rescue the danger, and at the moment of impact, he collided with the incoming ball, bouncing the ball back into the field, escaping the great disaster. This ball did not go in, which was truly St. Joseph's misfortune. After that, Guanghua dominated the advantage. Zhuo and Zou shot three times, but unfortunately they were too hasty and went over the bar, losing a sure victory. At the end of the first half, Guanghua was only ahead by a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>After changing sides, the battle became more intense. The St. Joseph's team, having failed to score, roused their spirits and charged forward bravely. Center forward Li An'na led the team himself, and attacked the Yellow Dragon like a broken bamboo. Guanghua's position was shaken and the situation was critical. Hou Zifen disregarded his own safety and used his back to block An'na's iron bullet, narrowly escaping death. Guanghua's dangerous situation was resolved, and the forwards launched another quick attack. Wenzhi with three knives and two axes, rushed straight at the opponent, Zhifen charged horizontally, trampling on the enemy camp. Xia Xian only looked after the left, and did not guard against Shijin's surprise attack, who came from behind to capture the treasure and send it into the net, scoring another goal. St. Joseph's, having lost two cities in a row, was not reconciled, and tried hard to chase, adding more land along the edge to cut in. Huilin intercepted, carelessly committing a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Seruo sent the ball high in front of the goal, the landing point was beautiful, and Jin suddenly fired a cold arrow from the crowd, shooting it straight into the goal, Guoqi was too late to stop it, breaking their duck egg record. The two sides continued to struggle, with each side attacking and defending in the midfield melee. The St. Joseph's team once gained the upper hand, but their forward shooting skills were good at shooting aimlessly, and every opportunity was picked up by Guoqi. After a long time of attacking without success, the front line could not advance, and the rear became eventful. The hinterland was surrounded, and water could not pass through. Zhifen took advantage of the wonderful ball delivered by Jingcong and vigorously kicked it at the goal, but was blocked by Ma Guishi. Jin Shi's eyes were sharp and his feet were quick, adding another kick, hitting the bullseye again, making the score 3-1. After that, Guanghua's offensive became even stronger, and Shi's aura was awe-inspiring. De Rong was eager to save the ball, and collided with him face to face, injuring his hand tendons, groaning and leaving the field for treatment. He returned shortly after, and fought until the end of the game, without making any achievements. As a result, Guanghua won St. Joseph's by a score of 3-1. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Guanghua</p>
<p>Li Guoqi, Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng, Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui, Huang Jingcong, Zou Wenzhi, Zhuo Shijin, Qian Zhifen, Liang Bingjin</p>
<p>St. Joseph's</p>
<p>Ma Guishi, Sousa, Xia Xian, Paniella, Wu Derong, Si Ma Guishi, Ya Lieweishi, Jin Shi, Li An'na, Wodi, Jia Shidili</p>

<p>Li Wah Cup First Act: Western Civil Servants Eliminate Army Combined; No Exciting Results, 3-1</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the Army Combined and the Western Civil Servants competed for the Li Wah Cup final spot at the Kowloon Club stadium. The Army Combined's center forward was originally scheduled to be Wenton from the Army Service Corps, but at the time, Piason was appointed instead. The rest was consistent with the original, with a very neat lineup. Everyone thought that the weak Western Civil Servants would be beaten beyond recognition. Unexpectedly, as a result of the battle, the Army was miserably eliminated by 1-3. The two-time champion was put on the stage. The Army's defeat lay in the scattered forwards, the incompetent center backs, and the left winger Corulu, who often made useless interceptions and repeatedly missed opportunities. Could it be that Corogan and Watson, who are scheduled to return home tomorrow on a British transport ship, performed poorly because their hearts were already set on returning home? And the small venue was also one of the reasons. The Western side's defense was good, and the individual strength matched the opponent. The ordinary Cololus was able to safely defeat the enemy. The forwards Liao Yachen and Fula, and Zuo Zhi performed the best. The Zuo brothers saw through Haoli's path, (Haoli is the Kowloon Club goalkeeper in this league), and avoided the heavy and took the light. Haoli was not disturbed by them. Fula's horizontal charge and straight attack, scoring two goals alone, was also a miracle. The great war broke out on time. The military took the offensive first, and the civil servants tried their best to fight back. At ten o'clock, Dipaluo crossed from the baseline. Fula, who was standing in front of the goal, jumped high to head the ball, but hurriedly missed it. Zuo Zhi's sweep went over the bar, and both missed the opportunity. At 12 minutes, Zuo Zhi took a long shot, the ball was not strong, but the angle was very good. Haoli did not dare to delay, and flew to push it out of bounds, only conceding a corner kick, which was ineffective. At 15 minutes, Corulu forced a corner kick, which was in vain. At 20 minutes, Liao Yachen made a diagonal shot, Haoli went to save it out of bounds, conceding another corner kick. Dipaluo took the kick, but there was still no effect. At 28 minutes, in the melee, Liao Yachen made a diagonal pick, and the ball flew into the net. Haoli could not save it, and the Westerners won first with a score of 1-0. At 34 minutes, Nov threw a sideline ball, Hou Lu passed it to Fula, Fula dribbled twice, then shot, and again scored (2-0). The whistle for half-time sounded.</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, Corulu rebelled at the border defense, only got a corner kick, and returned without success. At 18 minutes, Watson left the field, and Guni _ defended the right flank, and Gan Wenbei rushed to the center. In the penalty area, he committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard free kick. Jia, the main player, fell to the wasteland diagonally, losing a sure-win opportunity. At 27 minutes, the military team launched a major counterattack, and the wind was howling, and the grass and trees were all soldiers. In the melee, Piason lifted his foot and swept it, and the ball went into the net (1-2), breaking the egg. After that, the military coalition's forwards were very sharp, and it seemed that they had the momentum to catch up with the draw, but in the last minute, Zuo Zhi passed it to Fula, and added another kick, winning another goal, eliminating the military coalition with a score of 3-1. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Entertainment... Princess and Attendant</p>
<p>Baroness and the Buller</p>
<p>Originally a famous stage comedy, now adapted into a movie. The story itself has a strong comedic appeal, coupled with the energetic performance of the humorous star William Powell and Annabella, making this film an extremely excellent and successful work.</p>
<p>William Powell plays an attendant, the most capable servant in an earl's household, handling all household matters in an orderly manner. The entire earl's family is extremely satisfied with him. Unexpectedly, this attendant is secretly engaged in political activities and is elected as a member of parliament, standing on the opposite side of his master's party. In his profession, he is a loyal servant, but in politics, he delivers political speeches, relentlessly attacking his master. The earl is quite broad-minded and has some understanding of him, but the most unconvinced is the earl's daughter, a standard aristocratic lady (played by Annabella). In this situation of conflict and contradiction, a series of jokes ensue.</p>
<p>The film has wonderful dialogue, containing truth within humor and wit. William Powell's style remains unchanged, calm and composed, naturally eliciting laughter. Annabella, in this film, makes her first appearance in an American-made movie, and she also delivers an excellent performance.</p>
<p>Queen... Color Film Highlights</p>
<p>The pen-and-ink animation produced by Walt Disney is praised and welcomed by every audience. Especially after the success of his bold attempt with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," it has received great attention from general movie enthusiasts. A screening of "Color Film Highlights" selects and assembles his recent works, totaling ten reels. The film titles are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e63">"The Fox Hunt," "The Strange Parrot," "Livestock Symphony," "Playing Ball Jokes," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairy Tales," "The Whale Hunt," "Lucky Day," "The Non-Fighting Bull," "Giants' Tale" <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The painting techniques, as well as the coordination of colors and tones, are all perfect. The stories are concise, lively, and full of rich interest. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations, among which "The Non-Fighting Bull," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairy Tales," and "Giants' Tale" are particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Safety... Modern Female Detective</p>
<p>The Mad Manton</p>
<p>A film that combines romance and mysterious murder cases, presented in a humorous and crazy style. Barbara Stanwyck plays a completely ruined socialite who accidentally discovers a corpse, reports it to the police, but by the time the detectives arrive, the corpse has been moved away by the murderer. Because of her usual behavior, people think she made up a lie to show off. This is clearly a false accusation against her. What she can't stand even more is that a young editor (Henry Fonda) satirizes her in the newspaper. So, she gathers a group of sisters and starts detective work. After discovering a second corpse, people sympathize with and believe her, especially the young editor, who helps her greatly. At that time, the murderer wants to kill her to silence her, but thanks to the police detectives encircling and annihilating the murderer, she is spared. The plot in the film lacks some possibility, but due to the excellent performances of the actors, the development of the story is natural and relaxed. The arrangement of the murder case is quite tortuous, but it does not occupy an important position in the film, because what makes this film captivating is not a tense and serious detective story, but a rich comedic interest.</p>
<p>East... Singing and Dancing Together</p>
<p>Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Starring Judy Garland, her singing voice, although not as moving as Deanna Durbin's, is still an extremely outstanding talent among newcomers. The family portrayed is drama-crazed, so everything is focused on comedy and song and dance. It is a typical Hollywood song and dance film in color. She not only sings well, but also has good expressions. Allan Jones is not as outstanding as he was in "A Day at the Races."</p>
<p>Great China... Adventures of a Boy</p>
<p>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</p>
<p>It is a very excellent literary film, adapted from Mark Twain's masterpiece. Although the entire film is very long, the director handles it well. The light and lively script makes us not feel bored. A part of it is due to the excellent performance of a group of child actors, especially the two main characters. Mildred Natwick, who plays the aunt, also performs very well. The color production further increases the value of this film.</p>
<p>Scenic Star... Go West</p>
<p>Way Out West</p>
<p>New World... A True Romantic</p>
<p>Starring Xu Li and Kuang Shanxiao</p>
<p>Central... Pearl Shirt</p>
<p>It hasn't been long since the death of Hollywood's Charlie Chan, and already a "Frozen Charlie" has been produced in the Chinese film industry. This speculative tactic does not require spending on publicity and can reap the benefits of the name. The cleverness of Chinese filmmakers can be seen from this. However, the script of this film failed to do its best, and at the same time, each tense scene also failed to be fully developed. The description of the behavior and actions of bandits is more of a failure than a success. The distribution of actors is also not very suitable. Apart from Liu Qiong, who has considerable achievements, Gu Lan Jun and Hong Jingling don't have much to do. Xu Xinyuan's Charlie Chan's facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of his actions is still not up to par.</p>

<h3 id="e65">A "Thorough" Question <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Cheng</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a Trotskyist propaganda publication. They actually consider themselves the most thorough in resisting Japan. In their descriptions, it seems that the National Government has not fought a single round with Japanese imperialism in the past eighteen months. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are constantly preparing to surrender. As for the Communist Party, they only use all their strength to attack their group of "Trotskyist bandits" and do not resist Japan. The only ones who truly "thoroughly" resist Japan are this group of "Trotskyist bandits," and their current main course of action is to "wage an irreconcilable struggle against the repressive policies of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party."</p>
<p>This is the new task of this group of shameless bandits under the new political situation. From this, we can fully prove their new conspiracy and their two-faced nature. This true face is that they are now using the name of "thoroughly resisting Japan" to conduct "irreconcilable struggles" against the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the national war of resistance government, the army, and the people.</p>
<p>However, just now, let us grab this fox's tail and knock their mouths awry. This is the easiest to do. We only need to raise such questions and ask these shameless fellows to answer:</p>
<p>First, in the past eighteen months, the army under the leadership of the National Government has launched a battlefield stretching thousands of miles and countless people fighting bloody battles. More than ten million soldiers and armed civilians have directly participated in the war, killing and wounding over 700,000 Japanese soldiers, and depleting one-third of Japan's national strength. Which of these tasks were done by the Trotskyists? If they did not participate, then they fundamentally did not participate in the resistance against Japan, let alone thoroughly resist Japan.</p>
<p>Second, in the past eighteen months, hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members have been working behind enemy lines. They have organized hundreds of thousands of people's anti-Japanese armed forces. In the enemy's rear, they have established anti-Japanese base areas and anti-Japanese regimes. Speaking only of the Eighth Route Army, in the past year alone, it has seized 9,100 Japanese rifles, destroyed 120 Japanese planes, and killed, wounded, and captured countless Japanese soldiers. Now, it has sent two brigades to advance into the territory of the puppet Manchurian state. In the Northeast, Communist Party members such as Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi have organized hundreds of thousands of people's anti-Japanese armed forces and have been fighting hard in the Japanese-occupied areas for eight years. Which of all these tasks can the Trotskyists do? If they cannot, then they cannot resist Japan, let alone resist Japan more thoroughly than the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Third, since the Trotskyists want to thoroughly resist Japan, and at the same time say that the enemy's strength is great, and we need to increase our strength by thousands of times to win, yet they want to first "wage an irreconcilable struggle" against the two largest political parties with millions of members, and oppose the establishment of an anti-Japanese national united front, may I ask what strength the Trotskyists rely on to wage a "thorough" war of resistance against the enemy? The enemy has invaded most of our territory for eighteen months, and in the future, there will be more intense and cruel battles. In such a critical time of survival, will the Japanese stop their general offensive and let these Trotskyist masters eliminate the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and then come to "thoroughly resist Japan"?</p>
<p>Fourth, since the Trotskyists boast that they are the most "thorough" in resisting Japan, then is it that their party members participating in the Japanese army's special operations team in Xuzhou and plotting riots in Guangxi are considered their "thorough" expressions of anti-Japanese action? If these are their thorough anti-Japanese actions, then the Chinese people, based on their eighteen months of anti-war experience, know how to put out these traitors and are fully confident in putting out any activities of these traitors.</p>
<p>Now, anyone can see the conspiracy of these shameless bandits, right? They attempt to lead people away from the true path of thoroughly resisting Japan—the anti-Japanese national united front—and follow their fake "thorough" path of resisting Japan, which is to dismantle the anti-Japanese front—the traitor's path. This is the Japanese imperialists' political disintegration plan, and the Japanese are using the Chinese to control the Chinese. Whoever cannot see that these are spies directed by the Japanese is a fool.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think it is strange that these good-for-nothings also put up the banner of resisting Japan, but in fact, this is precisely the characteristic of all spies. Look, wasn't Wang Jingwei, who advocated peace, the one who used to talk about resisting until the end and sacrificing everything? Trotskyist bandits are especially good at playing this trick.</p>

<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, it rained. On the red clay road, the low-lying areas were still patches of mud, but the high side, blown by the northwest wind, was frozen harder than rocks—the iron-rimmed wheels of the wheelbarrow were constantly jumping on this uneven road, full of ruts. Although I was not used to riding this kind of cart and my butt kept sliding down, listening to the monotonous hiss of the wheels on the mountain road and looking at the withered grass and red leaves everywhere (with a few white clouds drifting overhead), my heart couldn't help but relax. The soldiers stretching for miles, the crowds of fleeing refugees, the speeding trains, the crowded ferries, seemed to be things that happened a long, long time ago, and their authenticity was highly questionable.</p>
<p>A woodcutter was chopping firewood on the mountain. A country lady, sitting sideways on a donkey with copper bells hanging around its neck, came loudly, then walked away. If it weren't for the fact that my ears could still clearly hear the dull sound of Japanese planes bombing the capital, I would really suspect that I had just had a nightmare.</p>
<p>It was noon on the third day when I arrived at Xingdian Temple, surrounded by mountains. There was a market going on there. People selling mountain goods, selling New Year's goods, Lantern Festival vendors, vermicelli vendors, horses tied to trees, donkeys, it was so lively. Could it be that the smell of gunpowder and the sound of bombing were really blocked by the surrounding high mountains? The local people were so happy, quiet, and unconcerned.</p>
<p>After dinner, many strong villagers ran into Hanwu's house, listening to news of the war outside while asking how the "matter" was being prepared. They still had a indifferent expression, not even raising their eyebrows much.</p>
<p>It was only after they left that Hanwu told me that Xingdian Temple was even more "annoying" than Nanjing. If the Japanese occupied Pukou and Chuxian, Xingdian Temple would be completely under blockade. At the same time, bandits who hadn't dared to show their faces for more than ten years were now daring to discuss collecting weapons in tea houses. So, outside of Xingdian Temple were the Japanese, and inside there was the threat of bandits.</p>
<p>He then smiled, as if to comfort me, and told me that he had organized a guerrilla team of several hundred people. He and a cousin were both instructors at the Central Military Academy, so they had no problem with training and combat. Their first step was to eliminate the bandits and then annihilate small groups of intruding Japanese soldiers. I only stayed in Xingdian Temple for three short days, but the situation became increasingly serious. Enemy planes were bombing Nanjing and Pukou every day. Moreover, the sound of artillery could already be heard. So, I took my wife out of the mountains for the second time and embarked on the Jinpu Line, preparing to go to Guangdong.</p>
<p>The red clay road was no longer deserted. People from Pukou, from Nanjing, carrying chests, carrying bundles, riding donkeys, riding carts, walking, old people, women, children, shouting, clamoring, crying, formed an indescribable torrent of grief. This torrent was rushing towards Xingdian Temple.</p>
<p>Outside the city of Jiangpu County, we got off the bus and ate a few bowls of sweet dumplings. The old man selling dumplings told me:</p>
<p>"In this year, it's better to die than to live and suffer! When you die, your eyes are closed and you don't know anything, but when you live, you have to suffer. Yesterday, six or seven children fell on the road here, crying so miserably. There are even more today. Why do you say we should avoid the Japanese devils? It would be good if they came to fight! Wasn't it impossible to find them before? Living is to suffer, to be angry, and when you die, you have nothing, so why not fight?"</p>
<p>When I gave him the coins, he was still shaking his head.</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since I left Xingdian Temple. Recently, I received a letter from Hanwu, informing me that his plan has gradually been realized. The bandits were wiped out within a few months, and several small groups of Japanese soldiers have been annihilated. The guerrilla team has expanded to four or five thousand people. So far, no one has officially entered the city of Jiangpu County. He has been supported by the people of Jiangpu as the county magistrate since the fall of Pukou (formally appointed by General Li Zongren before the Battle of Huaihai), and it has been almost a year now.</p>
<p>I thought of that mountain city, that group of resolute mountain people. Although I didn't stay long in Xingdian Temple, their spirit of fearlessness is enough for me to remember and learn from for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>— Luo Xi</p>
<p>The sea is surging, the wind is howling. On the shore and mountainside, the blood of fishermen has dyed the vast blue sea and the green weeds red.</p>
<p>The sea is the home of fishermen, and fishing is the life of fishermen; for thousands of generations, no one would leave the beautiful fishing village, this fish-rich harbor.</p>
<p>Huge battleships floated from the horizon, dyeing the blood of fishermen a bright red.</p>
<p>Whoever dares to go to sea will not be able to return; whoever dares to go home will die under the knife: the chests and necks of the fishermen are blooming with red flowers every day.</p>
<p>What kind of world is this!</p>
<p>People outside the knife's edge dare not go to sea, dare not go home. In the remote wilderness, people roar, people clamor:</p>
<p>"We want to go home, we want a harbor, we cannot starve to death in the wilderness!"</p>
<p>"Since we are going to die anyway, let's fight him!"</p>
<p>So, the men picked up fishing spears, and the women picked up stones: for the fishing village, for the harbor, the fishermen are no longer afraid.</p>
<p>The sea is surging, the wind is howling, blood and blood are swirling, flesh and flesh are fighting, in the fishing village, at the head of the bay.</p>
<h3 id="e68">And Speaking of "Home" <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Nidi</p>
<p>Another year has begun, and there should be a new atmosphere in the literary world as usual. We have already seen articles such as "New Year's Writing" and "Welcoming the Republic Year XX." We have also seen many articles about "regretting the past" and "hoping for the future." Although they are similar to "embellishments," they are also in line with human nature: as long as they don't "beautify peace," that can also reduce a little "shameful" psychology.</p>
<p>Since I was a child, my concept of festivals has been pitifully weak. When I was older, I simply forgot about them completely, but this year I can't help but have some feelings. I think the first thing is probably related to the War of Resistance. And what I want to say is not some major party and national affairs, but something very small, a personal problem, that is, "home." When the Northeast fell, I was still a small chick sheltered under the maternal wings of "home." After listening to the teachers' beautiful reports at school, saying that countless compatriots there were displaced and suffered the disaster of being without "home," my fragile heart couldn't help but feel miserable. Who knew that since last year, I have also encountered the same "fate of having a home but being unable to return." Although I don't have to sleep on the streets now, and the place I live in has a roof above my head, my status is that of a freeloader. However, the one being freeloaded off is not some Lord Mengchang or the like, but a relative who is not a high-ranking official. Therefore, there is no help to be offered, and I should be idle enough. Indeed, there is idleness, but it is "enough" to be panicky. Children quarrel in groups, and the radio plays all day long, making it impossible to read and write freely. In addition to feeling emotional, I can't help but think of "home." However, please see: "Our mountain forest was burned down by Japanese soldiers this spring. Fourth brother and sixth brother's mountain forest, along with all the mountain forests near the village, were burned down. The reason is to prevent bandits from hiding in the summer. The villagers are all complaining. Where will we get firewood next spring?"</p>
<p>Indeed, where will we get it? The above is just a snapshot of a corner of the Northeast, from which we can also know one aspect of the Japanese army's virtuous governance. Although my hometown does not have mountain forests or nurseries, it does have quite a few chickens, ducks, and livestock. The newspapers a few months ago published a message about the Japanese army's wonderful method of catching chickens. Under their tyrannical power, even livestock are not at peace, let alone people?</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other virtuous policies. Shooting and beheading are their consistent practices, and I'm tired of hearing about them. However, I can't help but feel ashamed and live in peace on the prosperous foreign concessions, having the leisure to read some lewd entertainment texts. My happiness is not high enough.</p>
<p>But when I think of "home," I can't help but feel guilty.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Marching Notes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The more we talked, the more intimate we became. Even the situations of the battles between the two armies were revealed. I felt like I was in a myth, listening with vivid details. From this, we became new acquaintances and established friendship with each other.</p>
<p>Today, when he saw me, he acted like an old friend, asking questions about this and that. Then he said:</p>
<p>"The team was stationed so well, why is it moving out?"</p>
<p>"This is the order."</p>
<p>"Probably things are tight on that side."</p>
<p>"That's probably true."</p>
<p>"I hope you win every battle and succeed immediately!" He excitedly picked up a cup of tea. "Come, Comrade Li, have a drink!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, we'll see each other on the battlefield in the future." I couldn't talk to him too much, because I was too far away from the team, and I wouldn't be able to catch up. I said goodbye to him.</p>
<p>"Good! One day, you can see me ambushing and killing the little devils in the mountains around here! I won't keep you! Goodbye!"</p>
<p>Ancient Tomb Village—what a special name! The people of Ancient Tomb Village, how can people forget them!</p>
<p>It was a cloudy day, and a cool wind was blowing everywhere. This was the best day for marching, because if the sun came out, people would feel uncomfortable all over, and hot sweat would flow from their bodies and wet their clothes. When I got to the highway, I still couldn't catch up with the shadow of the main force. The short conversation delayed the journey quite a bit. "Walking is not afraid of being slow, but afraid of stopping. Stop for a while, and it's two and a half miles." This is absolutely true.</p>
<p>I didn't want to chase anymore; anyway, the team would rest at Linshan River after having lunch. There were always some soldiers coming and going on the highway, some with crutches, some limping, covered in a layer of dirt. There were very few cars, just like the common people on the road, you wouldn't see one for half a day.</p>
<p>This section of the highway was in terrible condition in some places. Some gathered people were doing repair work. The supervisor should be the Baojia head, sitting on the side so leisurely.</p>
<p>On the dilapidated temples, on the walls, on the bridges and tree trunks, there was no lack of red, white, and blue slogans everywhere. Everywhere were the same words. Who says this is not a good phenomenon? Slogans have penetrated into the people. But whether the people understand, I don't know.</p>
<p>It just so happened that on the wall of a house, the political department of the XX division had written a slogan of "Military-Civilian Cooperation" in large characters, but the house was empty with no one in it. The tables, chairs, and benches were still neatly placed there. What kind of feelings do the slogan and the house reflect with each other... (To be continued)</p>
