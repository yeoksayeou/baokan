<h2>Page 1</h2>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>悲壯的戰鬥的革命的五月，充滿着可歌可泣的歷史。這些歷史記載着壓迫和反抗，記載　　於全國人類的尤其是中國的未來命運的鬥爭。在這全人類的反法西斯反侵略陣綫激　開展的時候，在這全中國的抗日的戰爭臨到决定勝負的轉捩關頭的時侯，我們紀念五月，是具有特殊的意羲，是要認　而且負担當前更急迫的任務的！</p>
<h3>偉大的國際勞動節　—五月一日—</h3>
<p>五月一日，偉大的勞動節日，無論在全世界或中國，都有其　榮的英勇的　富的戰鬥的　史。</p>
<p>一八八四年美國工人在芝加哥召開美國勞動同盟第四次代表大會，决定要在一八八六年五月一日實現每日工作八小時制，否則採取直接革命鬥爭行動。</p>
<p>到了一八八六年五月一日，美國工人在「八小時工作日制」的口號下，展開了全國規模的大罷工，芝加哥等處還發生工人和警察流血的衝突，結果工人羣衆死傷相藉，著名領袖史庇士等被捕遭殺·激發了全美和全世界工人的敵愾和鬥志。</p>
<p>一八八九年，第二國際召集第一次代表大會，大會正式决定以五月一日爲國際勞動節，從這年起，全世界勞動大衆熱烈的紀念五一，在這天撿閱自己的戰鬥力，檢閱全世界的工人和其他勤勞　衆，要求改善待遇反對壓迫剝削爲社會主義而奮鬥的經騐和敎訓。他們要爲八小時工作制而鬥爭（一八八九年代表大會决定）他們要爲和平而鬥爭（一八九一年代表大會决定），他們更要爲社會主義而鬥爭（一八九三年代表大會决定）、</p>
<p>在外國，各國勞動大衆在五十三年以來，都有一年比一年更熱烈的五一紀念·而特別値得重視的是俄國的工人大衆，從一八九一年起，他們就熱烈參如五一的示威遊行，反對沙皇政府和　產階級·在歐洲大戰時代，歐洲廣大勞工被欺　而充帝　主　大戰的砲灰，而俄國勞工大衆則更熱烈地展開他們革命的鬥爭，從一九一八年起，五一節就在革命的蘇維埃政權下舉行了·隨着　聯社會主義建設的邁進，蘇聯勞動大衆每年熱烈舉行五一紀念，他們已經　現七小時以至七小時以下的勞動日制，他們的勞動已不是爲剝削奢勞動而爲自己勞動了！他們的成功，影響到全世界資本主義國家勞動運動的鞏固和擴大，這種影響現在更加增大着。在中國，隨着帝國主義資本的輸入；隨着現代工人的　生他們在一九一八年（民國七年）第一次紀念五一勞動節·到了一九二一年（民國十年），中國勞動大衆正式成立他們自己的先鋒部隊自己的政黨·負担起半殖民地中國的勞動運動的雙重任務——社會解放和民族解放的歷史任務·他們緊接着政黨的成　，在一九二三年（民國十二年），在革命策　地的廣州，轟轟烈烈地舉行了國際五一節的偉大示威運動，就在這一天，召集了第一次全國勞動代表大會，成立全國總工會，中國工人的最高領導機關·</p>
<p>五一勞動節，不僅是全世界勞動大衆團結的旗幟，而且是中國勞動大衆團結的旗幟·這　　不僅在資本主義國家引導工人向幸福之途邁進，並且在殖民地和半殖民地的國家引導勞動大衆向解　之路　進·</p>
<p>然而，在今年紀念偉大的五一勞動節，是有其特殊的更重大的意義與任務了　第一，從全世界說，法西斯侵略戰爭的火燄，威脅着工人和全人類，因此全世界勞動大衆紀念今年的五一，就要用反對法西斯侵略戰爭，展開保衛民主與和平的反侵略陣綫，建立歐美和遠東的集體安全制，作爲五一節的中心口號了·我們要全世界勞動大衆切實爲這個中心口號而奮鬥　要有效地反對法西斯侵略戰爭，第一個中心任務就是全世界工人階級勤勞大衆本身，在行動上從職工運動方面以至工人的政黨方面達到團結統一·祇有全世界工人階級與一切勤勞大衆團結的統一戰綫的力量，才能最後戰勝法西斯侵略者，保障世界和平與人類文化，也祇有戰勝了法西斯侵略戰爭對於全人類的威脅，工人和勤勞大衆才能實現其澈底的解放·</p>
<p>其次，從中國說，我們首先要認淸目前政治形勢的特點，卽（一）日本帝國主羲大舉侵華戰爭發動已有二十餘月，一面證明×人侵華勢力一日仔在，則中國勤勞大衆的解放一日不能實現，一面又澄明勤勞大衆一日不積　的參加抗戰建國，則中國抗日民挨戰爭卽一日不能獲得最後勝利·（二）抗　二十餘月以來，我們物質上的消耗已有驚人的數字，同時外國物質的接濟則已遭而且將遭更大的因難，於是　加生產的重要更爲增加了·（三）我們全國團結堅持抗戰，已經引起全世界工人階級勤勞大衆的同情與援助，尤其是工人階級自己建設成功的社會主義祖國的蘇聯，他們這種援華制日運動還在繼續擴大中·組織工人和勤勞大衆，儘可能及應必要，給廣大勤勞大衆以武裝，國民黨二全大會宣言說：「民族革命運動必須有廣大的民衆參加，而工農民衆尤爲必須』，該會决議案中又說：」工人在民衆中最爲重要，若含此不圖，則所謂民衆基礎，必無從鞏固』，最近最高領袖和國民精神總動員，對於工人力量，尤爲重視，希望能够切實發動。（二）要切實保隙動勞大衆參加抗日救國的自由，獎勵并優待僑工囘國服務，全國的和各地的工人或職工組織中儘量　行民主原則，發揮他們擁　政府領袖××××××加緊生產競　的自動性與積極性。（三）推進必要的手工業，鼓勵僑胞和友邦踴躍投資於此業種事，吸收廣大失業與流亡的勤勞大衆，并保障其精神與物質的生活·</p>
<h3>充滿×腥的個紀念　五三·五七·五九·××·</h3>
<p>悲壯的五月，在每一個中國人心目中永不泯忘的祭日，要算是充滿了×腥的幾個紀念——五三·五七，五九，×××××</p>
<p>這幾個紀念日，都是日本侵略者加給中華民族的　辱的烙印！</p>
<p>先說「五三」慘案，這是在一九二八年（民國十七年）發生的，也是「九一八』事變的序幕·當時我們國民革命的北伐軍克復臨城進取濟南　日本田中内閣就有出兵山東的决議：派兵艦五十艘，陸軍　萬人，以一八師團長福田爲指揮官，四月廿九日北伐軍進　濟南城，福田率　的干涉軍亦於這天趕到濟南，與北伐軍對時·到了五月三日，北伐軍的某營長要通通城內日軍警戒綫，突　槍殺，接着日軍就實行大規模的屠殺。牠們在濟南各重要路口及樓上，架有重砲及機關槍，每隔數分鐘卽猛烈掃射一次，每次都有無數的市民和士兵　成血團·當時山東外交特派員　公時，因爲拒絕日方無理强求，慘遭挖去目珠，　戮耳鼻而壯烈犧牲！而屈辱求和的親日官僚黃郛，則竟允諾日本參謀部一切要求，而且執行了北　軍立即離開濟南的命令。多數革命的士兵，雖曾聯合市內的工人和近郊　農民，繼續抵抗，終因彈絕，於十一日晨撤退·</p>
<p>五三濟南慘案，是日本利甩封建軍閥帮助反動腐敗　　，以大規　的武裝力量，阻截我民族革命努力發展的殘酷的一幕·由於九三濟南慘案　時之實行屈服妥協退讓，卒至造成了兩年以後九一八的　陽事變，造成了日本侵略者大舉進攻中國的慘禍　但同時我們也要認淸，廣大的革命的士兵，工人和農民，在當時已經展開直接的抗日戰爭，而其後學生與市民的抗日救國運動，就史激劇地開展到全國，如果不遭到政治上的阻力，日本侵略者在九一八以前就會遭遇嚴重的打擊·</p>
<p>其次，五七和五九，事實發生在歐洲大戰的時候·那時日本××乘着歐洲各國不暇東顧×爲首先奪取德國在華的殖民地，於一九一四年八月對德宣戰，在我國龍江，萊州及膠州　一帶，肆意蹂躪·三個月以後，佔領了膠州，控制膠濟鐵路，威脅我整個山東省·這時操縱北京政府的封建　孽袁世凱，正在想　心機，以圖消滅中山先生所領導的革命勢力，陰謀潛國稱帝。日本××認定只有帮助中國反動腐耽勢力，才能實現侵吞中國的野心，便以『扶袁稱帝』爲條件，在一九一五年（民國八年）一月十八日派駐華公使向袁世凱提出二十一條件。對山東的權利，對日本在南滿和東蒙的地位，對漢冶萍公司的權利，對中國沿海領土的特權，甚　對全中國的內政，提出苛刻的要求，這些要求無一不是滅亡中國的具體辦法·當時袁世　竟兩半推半就，和他議價還價，日×知道世　的皇帝　夢，便於五月七日提出最後通牒，除了第五號關於福建的經營協定以外，其餘的條件必須在五月九日以前答應·賣國求榮的袁世凱竟在威脅利誘下全部答應了　於是全國與情沸騰，反袁抗日情緒，震動國內海外，誓不承認「二十一條』</p>
<p>「五七」和「五九」，是日×滅華計劃的第一步實行，牠在當時利用國際混亂，利用吾國封建　孽，利用腐敗政權，利用賣國求榮的民族叛徒，帮助反動腐　勢力壓迫革命救國運動，牠們這種技倆，卽在今日，還在繼續運用，而且　巧妙更惡毒了，如像利用汪精術等「反共」「和平」的等言論行動，當我們進革命勢力抬頭之時，他們這種毒計陰　亦必更加猖狂橫行！表現了工人大衆由經濟鬥爭轉到政治鬥爭的偉大力量，雖然因爲當時日本××聯合陣綫力量顯佔優勢，我們又未能眞正的團結政府，軍隊和廣大的農民，爭取國際上的援助，進一步的展開鬥爭二造成了失敗；但是已經團結了工人階段，　識份子和民族資產階段，在不斷的頑強鬥爭中，收　經濟抵制的實効，並月展開了一九二五——一七年大，革命的勝利的前途·</p>
<p>五三·五七，五九×××等悲壯的歷史事實，和經騐與敎訓，指示我們，在目前爲抗　　國的成功而鬥爭的新的艱苦階段，我們必須更加認淸日本帝國主義是我們唯一的最大的×人，我們必須更加認淸工農大衆是民挨革命的主力軍，我們同時還要認淸，助政府軍隊力量與爭取的國際　情援助的重大的意義·因此，我們今年紀念五三，五七，五九×××的任務第一是擁護中央，　護將　員長，××××××。我們要推行國民精神總動員，提高民　自尊心與自信心，克服悲觀失望情緒，肅淸和平妥協的言論行動。第二是鞏固全國的團結。我們要密切國共兩黨的合作，鞏固及擴大國內各民族各黨派各　體各界民衆×××××××。第三是加緊政治的進步，我們要鞏固國黨和中央政府的領導，要發展國民經濟，要改善民××××，要推行民主政治，祇有在抗戰中力求政治的進步，才能激底實現三民主義，保證戰後建設三民主義新中國的成功·第四，要力爭國際同情援助。要從發展保衛民主與和平的反侵略陳綫運動，爭取國際援華制日　動的更多更大的實效·</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>保持與發展抗戰的勢</h3>
<p>蔣委員長于廿四日晚接見記者，發表關於軍事及政治的談話。</p>
<p>在軍事方面，委員長特別指出：「總反攻尚未開始，」粵漢平漢以東戰事，不能重視一地一城之得失進退，確信×人决難久持』這一談話，對於新近再度發現的速勝論者，給予嚴厲的矯正。我們要知道目前我們抗戰力量確已日趨進步，×人作戰確已日趨退化，但是日本原是優異的帝國主義國家，我們自不能以一朝一夕之間的反攻而予×以致命的打擊，我們目前的反攻，只在力爭主動，牽制×人的新的進攻。克服相待階段所遇到的困難，而便利未來總反攻的一切準備的進行。因此我們不僅對於×人的進攻　有輕忽，而　還要加倍努力支持我們力爭主動阻止×人之進攻的軍事行動，我們還要加緊增强抗戰力量，增速政治進步，增加×人內部和國際的困難，然後才能順利地展開總反攻。</p>
<p>在政治方面，蔣委員長注重政訓練，尤重視下級行政機構改革問題，希望藉以納地方黨政於新軌，確立民主集權自衞自治之基礎。這是與目前各戰場上的車事的反攻，有其同等重要意義的。因爲無論爲制止×軍的進攻，或爲準備未來的總反攻，都有賴於前淺戰鬥力的增强，×後游擊戰的發展和後方新生力量的培植，而所有這些，都有賴於廣大的民衆力量的動員。民衆動員的確切實現，則又有賴於政治的進步，主要的一方面要改善下級行政機構及黨的工作，第一步先要掃除民衆動員的障碍，另一方面儘可能地給民衆以充分的民主自由，發揮民衆參加一切抗戰建國工作的自動性與積極性，第一步就要各地民意機關的儘速成立，進而加緊民衆的組織與訓練，並儘可能的給農民工人以武裝。</p>
<p>目前各戰塲反攻的勝利，已經收得相當美滿的成果，第一是在政治上予汪精衞等××××的陰謀與抗戰失敗論調以無情的打擊，振作了人民對於抗戰勝利的信心，提高了前線將士的攻擊精　，更興奮了國際人士對於我國抗戰前途的樂觀同情與暖助的决心。其次是在軍事上實現了「攻勢防禦，實現了「制×機先，實現了阻止及打擊乂人的新進攻，現在全面抗戰形勢確已取得主動的優勝的地位了！</p>
<p>不過我們同時還要認淸。×人的優點還沒有完全喪失，×人的進攻力量還沒有遭受致命的打擊，他們還有力量配合政治上反共和平等陰謀，在軍事上策動新的進攻，而且目前已經發動了這種進攻，主要的是以打通平漢粵漢兩路鞏固華東及東南佔領區爲主眼的對於長沙的進攻和對於福州潮汕的威脅。因此我們不僅還要以加倍的努力，保持及發展目前各路前綫『攻勢防禦』的優勝地位，並月還要以加倍的努力在×軍後方發動大規模的游擊戰，牽制及削弱×車，使不能再前進再深入，同時還要準備新的更大的力量，如建立新軍，擴大空軍及發展機械化部隊等，準備將來的總反攻。</p>
<p>所有這些，根本就要求政治上更大的進步和外交上更大的成功。這一點在最高領　已有明確的認　與積極的努力，蔣委員長廿四日談話之重視改革下級政治機構，確立民主基礎等，眞是使人爲抗戰建國前途更堅信心更增欣慰的。我們希望全國一致擁護蔣委員長關於促使政治更大進步的這種偉大的計劃，我們要促使各黨派的合作更加密切，三民主義的民主政治之實施更加充分與普遍，促使反妥協反漢奸如反汪運動更加堅决與澈底，進而促使以國民精神總動員開始的民衆動員與組織工作更加廣　與更加持久，再配台着國防建設經濟建設與外交工作的推進，和對×軍工作的發動。我們如果能够加緊這些工作步驟，則我們必能縮短過度時期，並且克服相持階段的困難，增加×軍的困難，而提前全面總反攻的到臨。</p>
<h3>革命導師光榮紀念　—五月五日—</h3>
<p>五月，充滿着×腥的戰鬥的氣氛·五月五日，也給我們留下痛苦的記憶：第一是一九三二年（民國廿一年）『一二八」戰役不能支持到底所造成的五月五日的屈辱的『淞滬停戰協定』，第二是一九三四年長城抗戰不能支持到底所造成的五月五日的屈辱的塘沾協定·這些協定在今日已經失去効力，但在我們的痛苦的經驗與重大的敎訓，却還　新　的·</p>
<p>除了這些痛苦的記憶以外，我們對時五月五日，却要與奮鼓舞　提出　　革命　　　光　　　　　·第一·是一九二一年（民國　年）辛亥革命失　後的第十年的五月五日，中華民國第一任臨時大　　孫中山生先又在廣州就任非常大總統的職位，重新樹立起南方革命政權的基礎·第二，是在一百廿一年前　一八一八年五月五日、在歐洲　生了一個世界偉人，科學的社會主義的創造者，　產階級革命的導師，被壓迫民族解放運動的熱烈　　者——馬克思·</p>
<p>我們紀念中山先生在廣州就任非常大總統，在今日更有重大的意義，因　中山先生此舉，對於中華民埃革命是有非常重大的作用，一九一四年的五四運動以後，中山先生就在上海將中華革命黨改名爲『中國國民黨　，以「鞏固共和，實行三民主義』爲政綱，同時還著作「建國大綱』，創辦『建設』雜誌。到一九一二年五月五日在廣州就任非常大總統以後，×××××××××××××××××××中山先生一面親赴廣西準備北伐，一面在廣西接見　產國際的代表馬麟。接看蘇聯代表越飛於一九二二一年來華，訂立『孫文越飛恊定』，××××××××××國　黨開始了一九二三——四二年的澈底改組·這年秋天，中山先生又在上海召集前進的革命的份子（當時陳獨秀也在內）起草國民黨改組計劃，並於一九二三年一月一日，發表國民黨宣言，確定了此後革命的方針·主要的是（一）修改不平等條約，恢復中國在國際上自由平等的地位（二）實行普選制度，廢除以資產爲標準的階級選舉（三）確定人民有集會結社言論出版居住信仰之絕對自由權（四）制定工人保護法，以改良勞動者之生活狀况，改良農村組織，增進農民生活，確認婦女與男子地位之平等（五）由國家規定土地法，使用土地法及地價稅法。一九二三年，十月國民黨發表改組宣言，並開始實行改組動在廣州成立國民黨臨時中央執行委員會，並聘　羅廷爲顧問·緊接着國民黨又於一九二四年一月二十日在廣州舉行第一次全國　表大會，討論：（一）改組國民　，通過新政綱，新黨章及宣言；（二）通過組設國民政府案；（三）准共產黨及社會互文靑年團加入國民黨·大會結果，規定了國民黨明確的政綱，以××××××××軍閥爲　鬥爭的中心任務，以聯俄聯共及農工爲其政策。</p>
<p>在今日紀念中山先生就任非常大總統，我們囘首廣州，已成鬼域益不能不追念昔賢，我們要誠心誠意地接受中山先生留給我們的革命的三民主　，執行解决中國問題的中心任　——爭取民族獨立民權自由民生幸福的任務，我們要誠心誠意地　澈中山先生留給我們的三大政策，鞏固國共合作與全中國的團結，鞏固中蘇合作與全世界民主和平國家的團結，切實實施扶助農工動員農工力量支持抗戰建國大業·同時我們還要繼承中山先生與×人反革命勢力誓不兩立誓不妥協的精神、，對於中國人民反抗外國的侵略者，表示熱烈的同情·他還曾對中國的　外　易，對中國的社會經濟結　，作過科學　分拆和研究·從他的結論中，得出了警告侵咯者和指出中國人民鬥爭的目　——『中華民國——自由平等博愛」！（以上參　馬克思的「資本論」和馬克思恩克斯的　論中國　兩　）</p>
<p>關於馬克思的　大。列寧和孫中山先生　有明確的說明，列寧說：「馬克思主義的一切天才，正在於他把人類先進思想已經提出的問　給了囘答。他的學說是直接繼續着哲學，政治經濟學，以及社會主義偉大代表者們的畢說而產生　來的；「孫中　先生說。。「馬克思所著的　和所發明的學說，可說是集　千年人類思想的大成·』</p>
<p>馬克思遺留給我們的科學社會主義的　　的巨著，正如孫中山先生遺留給我們的三民主義和三大政策，在這全面抗戰轉向勝利前夜的艱苦與危險階段，我們必須以最大熱誠去接受，去研究，用以武裝我們的頭腦，求得正確的社會科學知　·我們目前必須加倍努力於爲克思主義的研究，從國際工人運動中取得經　和敎訓，配合××建國運動的實踐，爭取中華民族解放和「自由，平等，博愛——的中華民國」的建設·</p>

<p>法幣發行　政策</p>
<p>中、中、交、　、　行法幣之發行政策、特別　　發行　在二十六年六月、爲十四萬零、百萬元、二十七年六月、爲十七萬二千七百萬元、計　加三萬萬元、有人　此卽係通貨膨脹之例　、實則抗戰重心內栘以後、兩廣川滇等　改用法幣、商業信用收縮、而改用　　交易、淪陷區内僞券充斥、增大　幣之窖　熱度、以及因商品供需失調、致物價高漲、籌碼需要　增、皆爲法幣發行必　增加之理由、上海方面反感通貨　縮之現象、如匯劃　水之高漲、是以政府未曾濫發法幣、能使法幣價仙、維持於不　、</p>
<p>人　　　　準備充足</p>
<p>法幣政策　　以後、人民一致表示　　、抗戰發生、法幣之高低、卽　個人財力之消長、尤對之發生熱　情　、除極少數　、病狂之投機者外、莫　願法幣基礎鞏固、利國利己、皆以用法幣換外匯爲可恥、至於法幣之現金準備、始終在百分之六十以上、我國存美國之美金、至去年六月底止、估計尚有八千四百萬美金、此　　外　之準備、則法幣在外匯之價値、盤旋於目前　率之間、當不　有巨大之起跌、目下尚餘留國內之存銀數、能　用其半、其　力可以增　法　二萬萬元以外、同時且可權　維持現行外　　二年以上、</p>

<h3>游擊區宣傅綱要　（三）　軍委會政治部發</h3>
<p>（十六）普　宣　并解釋本部　訂　軍民合作公約的條文、務使×後軍民一致遵守、以　全我戰勝×人　一之要素」、</p>
<p>（乙）對　戰地部隊的宣傳要點、</p>
<p>（一）遵照委座「第二期抗戰、就是我們　守　　、轉敗爲勝的　　』的指示、以　發第二期戰略的特　、說明第二期作　、乃是在第一期　耗及困敝×人力　以後、在「我們爭取最後勝利戰略上一切布置的完成、』（委座語）」以後轉守　攻、以　成　毀×人侵略的迷夢、使他歸于失敗、』（委座語）獲取最後　利的時期、</p>
<p>（二）留駐×　的正規軍、必要時須派出若干小隊、去從事游擊戰爭、而在戰地的　擊隊擴大生長起來、亦可以集合若干　伍、編成止規軍隊、兩者中間、原無絕對的界限、故必須使兩者　瞭有互習彼此所必　的機能之必要、</p>
<p>（三）二期抗戰戰區更加　大、戰綫更加延畏、交通史加不　、而×人兵力更加不數、分配有顧此失彼之　、必須留給我們許多可乘的間　、因此我們在作戰上、必須加强各方作戰的配合與聯絡、必須努　養成部隊對于友軍親愛、與互助的精神、保障我們作戰的勝利、</p>
<p>（四）軍隊作戰沒有民衆的帮助、很少能够獲得勝利的、留在×後的部隊、尤其是游擊隊；須倚靠民衆的　戴、擁護和支持、所以在戰地的部隊、尤須有良好的　律、「就　一期抗戰各地經　而論、凡政府求民衆協作的事、只要有良好的辦法、民衆無不　　樂從、可見只有軍隊、對不起民　、沒有民衆對不起軍　的、』（部長語）所以在敵後的部隊政工人員、必須多宣　　解、無限的提高部隊的自動的政治　律、和軍事　律、</p>
<p>（甲）政治紀律、要做到部　在駐紥地方、（子）出入宣傳、（丑）打　淸潔、（貫）借物要　、（卯）損失要賠、（　）買賣要公平、（巳）講話要和氣、（午）嚴格遵守新生活邋動之一切規定、（未）尊重民間良好習慣、使民衆不討厭部隊、積　的努力實現「服務卽宣傳「的原則、切實幫助民衆解决困難、爲民衆服務、博得民衆的好感、</p>
<p>（乙）軍事紀律、要絕對服從長官、確實執行命令、」養成官兵視命令重于生命」的習慣、要　苦耐勞、隨時對于部下要管理愛護、對於友軍嬰親愛協助、自己要刻苦　勞、隨時學習研究、餋成一旦處　困難的環境、能發揮「人自爲戰」的能力、要愛惜子彈、槍械、　畜、用具等等、</p>
<p>（五）戰地部隊要負起建立和鞏固革命政　與組織革命民衆的任務、故須本「宣傳即敎育」的原則、培養　部、務使每一官兵、都能成爲民衆的宜傳者、與組織者、本着自己所學的知能、去宣傳民衆敎　、與組織民衆、才能擴大政工的效果、鞏固我們的政權、</p>
<p>（六）戰地部隊、尤其是　擊隊、經常活動　×人後方、×人一定要用盡種種方法、「掃蕩』我們、用挑撥離間威迫利誘的手段、來瓦解我們、所以每一個戰鬥、或其　工作人員、對于抗戰必勝、必須不斷的宣傳敎育他們、提高他們的文化水準、隨時糾正他們不正確的觀念與見　、隨時啓發他們、使他們　有正確的認識</p>
<p>（七）對于流落在戰地的散兵游勇、乃至流氓士匪等、必須設法收容、運用宣傳敎育方　、去說服他們、　育他們、使之走上正軌勿爲×人利用、</p>
<p>（八）與民衆協力肅淸漢奸×探、其能洗心革面、不再爲×人利用者、應依照政府所頒佈之漢奸自首辦法、許其自　、免予懲治、</p>
<p>（丙）對於戰地民衆的宣傳要點、除對於全國民衆的宣　綱要、及上述共通的宣傅要點所舉者外、對於戰地民衆的宣傳、必須注意下列　項、</p>
<p>（一）首先要隨時宣示×吏的欺騙行爲與陰謀的具體事實、以鼓動民衆　於×人的　恨、尤須隨時指明（最好用我們戰勝×人的實例來　明）人的危機與弱　、消除民衆對於×人的恐懼心　、鼔勵民衆起來幫同壤破×人之交通、　撓×人政　　濟文化之一切　施、以至參加　　隊、與×人作戰、務從實　工作中來　傳敎育民衆、</p>
<p>（二）必須喚　×後民衆、提高他的警惕性、勿受×人的欺　和麻醉、（子）不進×人和　奸所辦的學校、及各種訓練班、不　讀×人和漢奸所刊行的書報雜誌、及一切宣傳品、并動員各種敎帥、在戰地領導其　徒、對抗×偽的傳敎人、以粉碎×人與漢奸的奴化敎育策政（丑）不信×人　虛偽宜傳、明白了×人的欺騙宜　之後、應該轉告他人、勿使再上其　、以粉碎×人的麻　政策、（實）推行新生活運動、禁絕吸食毒品（如　啡白　等）嫖　等惡　、以粉碎×人的　化政策、</p>
<p>（三）宣傳民　、作空室　野的　練與準備、</p>
<p>（四）幫　民衆建設戰地的文化、卽是繁助駐在地民衆恢復和建　學校、設立識字班等、　提高戰地文化、掃除文盲、主要　　提高民　民族意識、培養服務習慣、鼓　犧　精神、完成國民　神總動員的使命、</p>
<p>（五）　　傳增加生產、長期改善民衆生活、增加長　抗戰的力量、政工人員　應　　部隊、于餘暇時幫助民衆生產勞動、澈　實　「服務卽宣傳」的原則、以擴大宣傳的影響、</p>
<p>（六）對于兵役宣傳、應該注意戰　的環與、戰地不易進行徵兵　、應鼓勵　衆志願應　、自動從軍、或加入游擊　、一　可以達到兵　宣傳的目的、（七）應該在宣傳敎　中培養　許多靑年熱血的　部、以補充和擴大我們在戰地的軍事和政治的力量、</p>

<h3>全港話劇團體空前大聯合　『黃花崗』將公演了　為賑聯會籌款撫恤抗戰陣亡將士家屬</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>「看—黃花崗上民族的先鋒，</p>
<p>把生命敲響革命的血鐘；</p>
<p>正春光明媚，楊柳依依，</p>
<p>誰忍水別父母與妻兒！</p>
<p>爭取民族的自由解放，</p>
<p>誓將白骨長埋　花崗，</p>
<p>黃花開，黃花落，</p>
<p>斯人一去不復回」</p>
<p>但願四萬萬五千萬同胞　起來，踏着我們先列奮鬥犧牲的血路，保衛中華—大中華永生！」</p>
<p>支吊黃花的悲壯歌曲，尤其是唱到「誰忍水別父母與妻兒』的時候熱淚汪汪，不由自主地掉了下來—爲了創造中華，黃花崗七士二烈士終於「忍心」「永別」父母與妻兒了！為了「踏着先烈的血路」再造中華，參加抗戰的無數將士亦終於「忍心」「永別」父母與妻兒了！惟有我們偷生着坐享其成的，惟有我們俯仰有父母與妻兒的，該如何慚愧！如何慚愧！</p>
<p>為了稍減內心的不安，為了　罪於萬一，公演「黃花崗」籌欵撫恤抗戰陣亡將士家屬，該是一　饒有意義的大事</p>
<p>黃花崗的革命，是中華民族最悲壯最偉大的史　；「黃花崗」劇本的完成，是前進戰劇家集體的創作，戲劇界空前的成就。在抗戰方酣的今日，公演「黃花崗」以歌頌捨身成仁流芳萬世的精神，籌欵撫恤抗戰陣亡將士的家屬，以慰先烈於九泉之下。這，實在是我們偷生者，後死者義不容辭的任務。因此，本港的戲劇界，本港各界賑聯會。都一齊起來，聯合献演「黃花崗」這偉大的革命中劇，實踐了空前未有的努力與團結。在香港寫成了一頁鮮明的歷史。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」原是定於黃花節公演的。可是因爲籥款不及與審慎安排，才决定五月三日起，一連三天在太平戲院演出。這更可以象徵黃花雖。而我們對於先烈的懐念與景仰却永遠榮繞於腦際中。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」這一個四幕六塲的偉大革命史劇，前後台須三百人始得演出，內容的生動，不言而喻。道具與服裝之偉大迫眞，自不消說。這次參加公演的劇團有新聲劇社，紅白劇團，中藝劇團，　烽劇社，旋風劇社，丁丑劇社，靑年團，中旅劇團，自强劇社，靭鬥劇圑，鐵流劇團，靑年同樂社，螞蟻劇團，先鋒劇團，時代劇團，香港靑年劇協等四十餘戲劇團體。</p>
<p>導演有歐陽予倩，胡春冰，鍾啟南，黃凝霖，盧敦，譚國恥等劇運先進，這二十幾天來，分別在華南中學與中藝劇團積極排練。工作進行，非常緊張。勇角盧敦飾黃興，女角區愛飾徐宗漢。姜明飾沒有說話，偏重　情之差役，其他一百多個角色，都是本港戲劇界之上選者，將來演出，料必有一番　人的成續表現可知。</p>
<p>邇來，賑聯會黃花崗演出特委會積極籌備，工作已有頭緒。（見連日本港新聞）現在的問題，就是要我們的僑胞牟牢記住。</p>
<p>五月三日起一連三天在太平戲院公演『黃花崗』的偉大革命史劇。爲了鑑賞最進步的戲劇藝術，接受最革命的洗禮，我們要立刻認銷入場券看「黃花崗」去！還要同情三百位熱心的演員，與翁備公演的熱心工作者，要帮忙他們推銷入場券，鼓勵家人，朋友，一齊看「一黃花崗」去。記住！記住！記住！這次義演所得的欵項，是爲賑聯會籌款撫恤抗戰陣亡將士的家屬！</p>
<h3>羅旭和對記者談　港府勸諭儲粮非實　當局對糧食已有適當措施　儲糧消息係月前某西人談</h3>
<p>昨廿六日本港各報、曾刊載港當局勸論居民儲備一個月糧食、以便非常時期來臨時、得免無所措手足、此消息刊布後、全港人土、均爲注及、而華人首席代表羅旭和爵士對此、尤爲關懷、記者昨特造訪羅　士于其辦公室、羅謂日來此間盛傳港當局勸論居民儲備糧食一月、且消息亦經見報載、兄弟于披閱之餘，殊覺詫異、兄弟事前毫無所聞，因此特往訪華民政務司嘉利君、叩以對此消息、曾否有所聞及、據華民司亦謂不知、兄弟乃隨卽往訪布政司史美、詢及此事、據史氏則答謂、港府并無下令或如何勸諭居民儲粮之事、惟杳該消息、乃先由一西報刊登出來，如欲知其來源、須俟向該西報詢問、方知原委、迨至今（昨）晨、布政司對兄弟答復、謂該西報所登載之消息、係于二三月前由該報記者與一西人談及去年九月因歐局嚴重、影響糧食問題時、傍及星洲糧食、而星洲報章、巳有刊載此種問題、但此乃屬星洲當地糧食關係而已、殊非番港政府肖若何表示也、至于香港之糧食大問題、政府嘗已有適當之措施、故兄弟敢鄭重對　港居民解釋、可安心無　云、</p>
<h3>預防霍亂運動　港府定五一開始　盼居民合作防疫</h3>
<p>屆入夏本港卽有霍亂流行症發生、苟不先事預防、則蔓延可虞、港府當局、將于五月一日、開始作預防霍亂運動、蓋有鑑于日昨本港已發現該症一宗、由澳門傳入也、且　南經兵　之後、流行症更易發生、去年各醫院及各區立醫局、曾厲行施注防疫針、收效甚宏、而居民亦悚于一九三七年霍亂流行死亡之重、亦不俟政府强迫而自　注射、故去年本港人口雖告增加，反獲平安渡過、醫藥當局、　盼居民能本去年合作精神、先事預防、除注射防疫針外、井須注意起居飲食云、</p>
<h3>「鳳凰城」，一齣熱烈的抗戰劇　龔家寶　……「中旅」今晚在「皇后」為婦聯會義演……</h3>
<p>寫一個劇本，原比寫其他的東西要難些、寫一個抗戰劇本，更比寫普通的劇本要難得多！</p>
<p>所以，當我們這民族自衛戰廣大地展開，戲劇工作的同志們風起雲湧地肩負了救亡宣傳的任務時，「劇本荒」便成普遍的現象，難以解决的問題。</p>
<p>香港婦女聯合會爲了慰勞前　將士，和中國旅行劇團合作義演已經决定今（廿八）晚九時在皇后戲院舉行—這次義演，「中旅」是犧牲全部演出費，義演的劇本雙方選定是吳祖光寫的一鳳凰城』，全劇的故事是描寫民族英雄苗可秀趙侗等在東北組織少年鐵血義勇軍、和×人作堅强的抵抗，直到　可秀在鳳凰城殉國，少年鐵血軍仍在他的勉勵之下繼績打　侵略者這一悲壯史　。穿揷了些夏婉冰—可秀的新婚夫人—由賢妻良母變爲堅强戰士；張生—可秀的忠傼—負傷救主光榮犧牲；夏川菊千—×人的女間諜—偷竊抗×計劃醫被捕；金瑛—朝鮮革命黨黨員—犠牲肉體和××中將結婚，候着機會行刺；以及小鳳姑娘立志投軍……等等有趣味的片段。</p>
<p>這劇本最好的優點就是熱烈緊凑，感情充足，描寫同胞們參加自衛戰的激昂悲壯，頗有「如火如荼」之氣勢，使演員很容易爲劇詞爲感動而使得整個的演出有情感，因而衆也就容易受感動！</p>
<p>全劇結構緊凑，情緒摯切，舞台效果也能相當的顧到；如果一定要吹毛求庇，那就可以說是寫得不够細膩，所謂「絞檸檬汁沒有能够絞到最後一滴」，然而這一點毛病，在整個劇本熱烈情感，氣勢磅的掩蔽下，也可以說是不足爲病了。</p>
<p>爲了救亡的宣傳，爲了籌款慰勞前線的將士，這個劇本在這地方演出，是有着特殊的意義的。希望大家出錢到這憂來賺得熱淚，賺得感奮，賺得我們對前方將士應盡的任務。</p>

<h3>閩西贛南沿綫上</h3>
<p>— 莫馮欄</p>
<p>鄱陽湖春水暴漲、×軍主力漸結集修河沿綫，贛北保衛戰、已臨山雨欲來前的緊急刹那、記者爲欲明瞭贛南戰時後方各種動態·决趁大戰的前夜、胃過連朝春雨、以　西長汀爲出發點、向贛南作烽火中的旅行、</p>
<p>車啓行時、是三月廿二日上午八時卅分、久經風霜的長途汽車像隻笨牛、不斷的喘氣拋錨、每每加足了油水、跑不了幾里路、又要停下來·雖是晴朋的天氣、多日累積下來的　水仍富於　射性、車飛過泥　時、兩旁像雨點急射的泥　、弄濕了每个旅客的外衣、明哲保身的旅客多低下頭來、再無心欣賞車廂外的佳景、</p>

<p>一入江西界、有一個特徵、滿山滿野栽遍了十字花科的綠肥、綠肥的花作白色、閒亦雜有紫綠、不甚明顯、一片白茫茫的花朵象一片雪、　遍公路的田蛙、據同車的長汀縣苗場江主任說、綠肥的　種在初春、二月初便把她！倒混入壤土，以增加土中的有機肥料、其功用和福建省普通所用的肥料略向、福建省和江西交界數縣、像長汀、寧化等那已開始試用、閩西贛北各地理區域上、同是武夷山的支脈、氣候、雨　又大抵相似、試用綠肥當無何困難，江先生又　及此行任務、在　買瑞金的良種黃牛、各種果樹苗及魚種、以改良長汀的　業、贛北今日　成爲戰區、贛南的農產品勢將全部供給前方、對于閩西不能再有所補益、針對這種可能、多山貧瘠的福建、一面提倡冬耕，一面提倡種旱稻、以造成本省的足兵足食、這種有遠大計劃的未雨　　，處處都可看出福建省當局對未來審變的有决心、有準備、</p>
<p>汀瑞公路是閩湘　綫的一小段，沿途處處都可見正在趕工建築的橋基、路面亦在舖料整理、路工忙碌得很、　瑞金四公里左右、公路跨綿江而過、橋梁被大水所冲、破壞了一段、眞　司機胆子大，用最高速度、涉水衝到對岸，浪花四　、蔚成奇觀、車到對岸，旅客驚魂甫定、都忍不住要下車看個究竟、旅客對急流斷橋、重溫一下驚悸的心、再看這　僑旁邊、另有一條用五十多個工人趕築的新式橋梁、那機雄偉　麗、象徵中華民族潛力的雄渾壯大、莫不相視作會心的微笑、</p>
<p>車抵瑞金車站、是下午一時二十分、四十二里竟駛五點多鐘，泥路破車、眞會挨延時間、記者剛下車、便又有一批旅客簇湧而上、要趁原車到長汀去、旅客中值得注意的是二個佩有紅色榮譽章的傷兵、傷左手的一個用右手扶着他的　疾夥伴、一跛一拐的靠近車廂、不是記者目擊、眞想不到後方民衆對傷兵這樣愛　、大家七乎八腳的把患　疾的那位傷兵扶持上車、讀出一塊空位、給他躺着、另讓出一個位子、給傷左手的那位傷兵坐、他硬不肯，老百姓更不肯、强擁着他坐下、記者爲這偉大的軍民合作場面感動得幾乎下淚了、含着眼淚重又跳上車廂、從袋子拿出一小包　　納霜，找一碗開水、教他服下、跟他們　談、才知道他　　是新　第六師的新兵、德安大戰後、補充第××師、轉戰修河前線、這次不幸受傷、躺在後方醫院　、不久戰區司令長官領卜榮譽狀、恩餉、遺教他們回鄉、而今、他們一個要囘寗化、另一個也囘泰寗去、他們對前方極關切，詢問前方戰况極迫切、及記者告訴他們贛北緊急、吳城鎮附近已發現×蹤時，他們都極抑鬱的遙望北方、像是悔恨這次的受傷，竟失去了一個大好的殺×機會、</p>
<p>瑞金環山抱水、魚池星佈、頗有江南風味、自從那次內戰後、三十多萬的人口、只剩下十九萬一千五百多巨　　厦、更多成爲瓦爍場。滿街滿壁寫各種各式的標語、這些就是歷史的遺跡、如果要多看些有歷史意義的建築物、城外八里有　庭公園，站有不少第十縱隊士兵爲紀念陣亡將士而建的紀念塔、紀念碑、城東十五里還遺留有　場和紅軍烈士紀念塔、靜靜的躺在那裏、</p>
<p>瑞金在昔為象湖鎮爲虔州管轄，到了南唐中葉才開始建縣、有綿江、墵溪穿流其中、所產米、豆、菸　、木材、准山芋、紙張、在亂前每年值二百多萬元、現在不過七十多萬元、抗戰後和　西之經濟關係、更是息息相通、瑞金的出產品靠汀江替他運輸、而瑞金所最需要的食　、也得靠長　替它轉運、閩西和贛南不但在地理形勢上同一區域、就是經濟關係也是不可分割的，</p>
<p>瑞金　有很好的自然賜與、而政治的機構仍使人失望、縣政還不如福建的健全、縣、區、保　間、組織極其　懈、每月一百二十一名的微兵額、東凑西就、人民竟有學昔日避亂　法、入山避役去、可見宣傳工作、　　方法不能臻於完　（未完）</p>

<h3>快樂天使　（十三）</h3>
<p>『哈立』外面又喊了、『快來』、</p>
<p>「來啦」、他無　無覺的答應着、</p>
<p>當哈立回來的時候，她止坐在鋼琴前彈着「一夕之歡」的調子、黃昏的　　使星裏昏暗、但是他仍能看見在她的睫毛上、閃耀着淚珠、當她發現哈立和她同在這空洞的房子時、她似乎并不　奇、</p>
<p>『你有了什麼困難、』</p>
<p>『沒有』他順手在一個桌子上拿了一瓶開過的香　酒、「這是誰的、」</p>
<p>「我的、你　點嗎？」</p>
<p>『謝謝，』他倒了一杯喝了、</p>
<p>『怎麼囘事？你過了墝界嗎？』</p>
<p>『那些女孩子都過去了，却乃先生答應照顧她們、』</p>
<p>「於是、你回到我這裏來了？」她的聲音温柔神秘、</p>
<p>『這是顯然的、』</p>
<p>愛琳望着他、忽然問、眼淚潤　了眼珠、『在你那快樂、音樂　的　魂利、有的是一個俠士的精神，你　着生命的危險、跑到這裏來、帮助和安慰一個在危難中的女人，這是事實嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的、這是明白而又簡單的事實</p>
<p>打開她的手袋、拿出一件東西、『看』她低低的說、『奧末黑的紀念品』、</p>
<p>哈立看着它覺得自已的眼簾發　、</p>
<p>『你記得　　——　　？』愛琳柔和的問、「我告訴你說、我不是每一個人、那是眞的、我不是任何人、我知道、一個人是用不着將眞的事告訴別人的、我想，我若能够撒極大的謊、我能使我自己偉大、但是、我不能向你謊、因爲你是　其餘的人不同的、你是一個誠實的人、』</p>
<p>毫不遲疑的、哈立用兩臂緊擁着她、他們吻着，</p>
<p>『我去設法弄護照、明天早晨我們九可以過境了、我們可以找到那六個女孩子、一塊去工作、我們可以合作了于。』</p>
<p>愛琳眼　發着光、她　形於色的說、「我會成一個偉大的　人丁了，」這時候、外面一陣巨大的破毀的聲音，有人　進房子來、</p>
<p>『炸彈、』這人叫喊著、『我們快到地窖裏去、』</p>
<p>『啊、不、』愛琳說、『我們一定要在這裏欣賞這個蔚然奇顴、』</p>
<p>『太太、我勸你不要太不在意、性命不是兒戲的、』那人說、</p>
<p>『不要担愛、死和我是老朋友、』</p>
<p>『關燈、熄減所有的燈，』外面又有人大呌、『每個人都到地窖裏去、』</p>
<p>『你要到窰裏去嗎？』愛琳問哈立。</p>
<p>『你要？』</p>

<p>游泳指南</p>
<h3>潛泳</h3>
<p>現在談談潛泳的話</p>
<p>假如練習游泳而車視呼吸的動作的、潛泳呼吸更是全部動作最主要的、呼吸量微細的、要想潛泳到五分鐘外、誠非易　、在水中、身體又得忍受惠大的壓力、困苦異常，初習潛泳的、潛在水中的身體跟水面的距離愈短急佳、因爲已到潛泳學習的階段、做到那樣、也很容易、另一方面來說、爲使身體感艾水壓習惯以增抵抗力計、也常　　相當深度的水中去、這時候、耳膜剌痛、胸部感受重壓、頭昏力港、遍體不安、習慣久了、比較易受、顯然進步的多、</p>
<p>許多胆怯的、深沉水中很覺實　、這也是莫、的缺點、妨碍練習、不過、關于潛泳環境是否安全、值得考慮、就在泳場中、跳台前那是危險的地方、池邊也是入水的好所在、一不留神、彼此受害、不堪設想、如在河海之中、危險更多、海面上的船艇、浮游着的東西、在在都威脅到潛　者的安全、潛泳中的眼睛睜着、初學者倒很不安、大多數的以此、閉起目來，至易吃虧、假如陽光照射着水面、潛泳者在水中並不覺得黯黑、原則上以開眼爲主、但在陰　的水中而又不詳其實况的、謹防　部給撞刺傷　了、還是以緩　速度潜進爲宜、</p>
<p>胸　的動作用爲潛泳的、最爲通宜、轉換上下左右的方向又怎樣呢（一）上下方向的變換、身體頓以前進的力量是由四肢與水相抵的動作發生、潛泳要想向下沈降、手掌就得向上推所謂向上推不是單以手掌推往水面的方向去、而是要在全部動作運用中的掌心上向、也就是頭能向下降去、這對下潛的助力很大、上升的手掌要朝水底壓下去、當然要頭部朝天配合運動起來的、（二）左右轉換方向：如向左轉、在手朝右推水的力量添增、右手的减少、就發主船舵轉換方向的作用了、要想右轉、應用同一的道理便得、</p>
<p>因爲通身都在水中、身體阻碍前進的積體此其他泳式更大、力求肢體的不傾斜和當四肢屈縮着的動作務求迅速、這是減少力量徒耗的方法、達到道个冀圖、先需具　正確優良的胸泳姿勢、否則在不易目睹而又更多困難的水中、要想潛泳的進步、不是善法、</p>
<p>潛冰應用起來、設所具此技太　、不大濟事，所以要把能够潛泳的距離增長、距離的長短可由時間和氣力來定、潛泳動作是　正確適宜、那亦有關、能够潛泳相當長久的時間和距離、自衛和應用更大把摧了、這得依照正確的方法努力練習下去、　（潘兆業）</p>

<h3>戰區工廠會計　決算問題的商榷</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>「千家野哭　焦土、萬姓　　何處歸、」在這抗戰的洪爐中、工、商企業的繁華、燬於烈燄、付之東流、尤以民埃輕工業的絲、紗、麵粉等廠、犧牲最鉅、或燬於火、或被霸佔、有的機器被攫、有的貨物被奪、「覆巢之下無完卵、」何况經濟生命綫的民族企業呢，筆者任職紗廠會計、十餘年、現在也因職業所在地、滬東、被封鎖着、被霸佔着、企業的生產機器、無法轉動、運帶我的　家庭生活、受到嚴酷的壓迫、我也陷於半失業的苦悶中了、史推想到大批的失衆職工們、大　突裏沒有烟霧、連帶成千成萬的小烟突、也斷炊了、這一切的一切、究是誰之所賜、這次歷史上空前中大刦大難、企業當局、誠然是剏鉅痛深、痛定思痛、然而茍有一絲復蘇企業的希望的、還是應該要繼續努力、和不斷的奮鬥、預播復與企　的未來的種子、從黑暗裏奮鬥出光明來、誠如奚玉書先生所說、「社會之安定、繫於企業的生機、生機不能維繫、任其借亡、則社會之騷　、將不堪聞問、故其能繼續進行業務者、應行設法保全爲上策……確是至理名言—（見前日本報、奚玉書先生「工商業辦理决算時、對於戰事損失之處理一一文）、</p>
<p>筆者茲就奚先生所提示之第二項、「資產」部份毀損、資本一部份受折、業務暫時無法經　因爲（一）交通阻梗、原料無法購置（二）戰區未開放、機器無法利用、（三）市面　條、卽有出貸亦無市銷、俟秩序稍復、業務猶可侍機而動……」這一節的事實、確然如此、筆者不　、爰就會計上决算問題一商榷之，</p>
<p>（甲）在實際上、未能確切明瞭、戰區　的房屋、機器、器具、貸物、等毀損程　之前、本年度會計决算、仍應列新科目、借方「戰區房屋」「　區機器」「戰區貨物』等以區別之、</p>
<p>（乙）如已明晰調査、確知燬損數字及實際損失情形應列一「戰事燬損費」科目、作爲「遞延資產一待復業後、逐年攤　之、</p>
<p>（丙）如戰區資產、已保有兵險，而尚未獲得　償之前、應以「借方」『戰區資產已保兵險」「貸方」「戰區　產兵險準備」嗣後獲得全部賠償時、或僅取得一部賠慣時、然後於「戰時財產損失費一科目中減除賠得之數、再列入「遲延資產」於逐年利益中攤銷之、</p>
<p>（丁）戰時特別費維持、（如酌留一部份員、役、及工廠看守人等開支）或由公債金項下撥付、或由螢運借款齪團維爲、戰事延長至今、已一年零四個多月丁—這項戰時特別開支、數殊可觀、鄙意可列入「戰時特別費」新科目中、同樣作爲「遞延資產」、將來逐年分難之，</p>
<p>（戊）「應付帳款」預先籌擬將來復業後分期拔付辦法、列入『戰　應付帳款科目』至於「應收帳欵』無法收得的可列入『戰時呆帳」科目、再往年决算時的各項資產「折舊準備」、仍當按帳面分別　提列入『資產損失費」中、待復業後逐年銷除之、質之高明、以爲然否、</p>

<h3>由放警報想起</h3>
<p>— 建彬</p>
<p>香港的空襲警報接連地試放過了，異樣的聲音，令人想起失陷的　州，那兒也有過空襲警報，不特天，有，並且每天的次數綫是很多。在市民的感覺上，已呈現個痲　狀態。就　那個時候，我每天早上還在床上打滾。初次警報就嗚鳴的　鳴了，接警又是緊急警報，震動不定的聲音，一起一落，似乎在預告日本創子手快要開工了。我照例匆匆滾下床來。連跳帶的溜上天台，用　糊的睡眼，看陸空砲戰。這時整個城市浸浴在朝陽的光　裏，全體市民的希望。都寄託在高射砲隊的身上了。這樣的經驗，可借沒有　被好久，大廣州便　，增城失落而淪陷了。在警報還能放得響的時候，高高在上的地方當局，還沒有好好地準備如何去保衛這革命策源地，如何去予打擊者以打擊，恰似今日的約翰牛一面在他的殖民地放着空襲餐報，一面又不願在歐洲聯成一條鐵的和平陣線，澈頭澈尾去打擊法西斯。</p>
<p>在廣州，緊急警報響了以後，空砲戰，隆！轟隆！響徹雲霄之際，電燈不亮了，無線電收音機不響了，自來水籠頭再也開不動了，意業入於半休止狀態，這種種經騐，早就由廣州的居民飽　過了，香港，這噢不着火藥氣味的天堂，今天試騐警報終於響了，我想，無恥的、淫的人們，應該知所警惕了吧？，可怕的經騐，不曉得在　一天就會降在他們的身上。嗚嗚幾聲警報，就是告誡這些忘記了祖國的人們，祖國正需要他們，再不要醉生夢死了。</p>
<p>今日，在國內放警報的職責，已由侵略者負担起來了，當我們的神鷹，飛臨廣州，漢口，南京，上海天空的時候，日軍的警報，不是悲感地響遍了嗎？高爾基作范訊譯</p>
<h3>孤獨的時候</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作　范訊譯</p>
<p>昨夜我在通過托洛寇橋時，看見一個年經的女人靜默地站着。這嬌小細的女人用她那戴着褐色手套臂勾搭在橋　上。我望了一會，心望了一會，心想她是姿跳到；面的尼伐河去。但是她祇伸出機靈的舌頭，惡意地向太空中的月亮裝模作樣。</p>
<p>月亮像一匹狡猾的老狐，在烟般朦　的雲間輕　地溜走，它　得又　又大，像一張酒鬼的醉臉。也汗這女人曾吃過它的　。她的動作是有報復性的。至少在我看來，他望着月作勢的舉止很冷酷的。</p>
<p>看到這件趣事後，我又想起另一些相似的小事，使我在囘憶裏放聲狂笑。照我看來，一個人孤伶伶地獨處時—至少他自已以爲旁邊並無他人的舉動是像一個有精神病的瘋人我也想不出別的字來稱呼這些做怪動作的人。</p>
<p>我初次看見人獨居時反常的動作，還是在幼年時代。在某次馬戲散場後，我看飾小　的英國呆子朗　爾獻技完畢，沿一條關無一人的走廊定着。當他走過一面大鏡時，突然脫下頭上的高帽子，恭恭敬敬地對自已的影丰鞠躬。這裏的確並沒第三個人，但我　就坐在他頭頂上的一條水槽裏。他不會發現我，然而我迎他的腿都看得淸淸楚楚，當他對自已　腰鞠躬時，我還探出頭來望他。這一天我悶悶地思索着，困感血不能解釋。可是現在我想起來，朗黛　不過是個　漢，是一個以做怪動作爲聯業的人，充其量不過是一個英國人器了。</p>
<p>許多年後的一天，我去訪安教托茶　夫君，人家告</p>
<p>我他在花園裏。當我走進園門時，我看到他獨自一人坐在那裏，他正想用帽子捉住太光陽來套在頭上，當然他的癡想是不會成功的。我能看出他怎樣因屢屢失敗而懊惱，他的臉愈漲愈紅，他迅速地把帽，擊着膝蓋，又匆匆地戴在頭上，最後無意于這个可能的玩意，一脚把身旁的小狗踢開，半閉着股向天上作了最後的一瞥，輕手輕足地走回自已的屋子。他在門口看到我了，他笑着對我說，「你念過白蒙特諧於節奏的詩嗎？哦！太陽在向小草微笑呢！好笨的傢伙，不是嗎？在羅西亞它對卡秦（洗衣人）的肥皂泡發笑，在這兒他對革達坦（草）的汗發笑。」</p>
<p>另一次我窺見他想甩一技粗大的紅鉛筆塞進一隻狹　的藥瓶，當然是無結果的舉動他大概知道他正在作打破一絛物理定律的大試驗，他用學者堅毅而忍耐的精神來榦這滑稽的把戲。</p>
<p>羅托爾斯泰現話般輕聲地向一個石龍說：「唔—你快樂嗎？」這小動物正伏在灌木業中的一塊石明上晒太陽。托爾斯泰靜解地站在它面前，依舊是他那老樣兒，把手挿在寬大的外衣袋內。最後，這偉大的文人拘謹地向四方望望，最後嘆口氣堅决地說：一假使我像你這樣，我是不會　到快樂的。」</p>
<p>大化學家鐵許温司基坐在自己的餐室裏，手裏執着的淺底茶盤，反眏出自已的而影。他向茶盤大聲地叫：「噲！老家伙，你一個人在做什麼？』但是影子冷冷地不駐會他。鐵許温司基長長地嘆一口氣，面色逐漸黯淡地起來。他對他自已的像蹙着額，痙學着鼻子，活像一隻老象的皺額和長鼻。</p>
<p>著名小說家李斯科文獨自坐在桌上，把棉花撕成小塊往碗裏一次次摔去。每次這小而軟的棉化碰擊碗底時，他豎起耳朵聽那棉塊在碗裏究竟會不會發出響聲。</p>
<p>伏爾迪斯基牧斯把一隻鞋放在他面前，嚴峻地命令　自己行走。『我知道你是不會走的。「他自滿而　傲地說　：「你看—沒有我你就不能到你所要到的地方。</p>
<p>「你在做什麽？老爸！」我出其不意地闖了進去。他望着我，解嘲似的說：「你問我鞋子的事情吧！這鞋子小得只穿到我的腳踵。現在他們老做這種惡劣的鞋子</p>
<p>女人獨自一個在裝飾或嬉笑時，常會自言自語。有一次我看到一個美麗而受過良好教育的女人，獨自人坐在窗下的安樂椅上吃糖果。當她每次用精巧的糖果鉗舉起她心裏的食物時，她　喃地說：「現在我要吃你啦—」當她吃完後，她又自言自語地說：「吃你的不是我嗎？」</p>
<p>某劇場的休息室棄祇有一個　來的黑　少婦。她在每面鏡子前都停留一囘。突然，我聽得她說：一不過—一個人總要死的。」</p>
<p>此地除了她和我以外，並沒有其他人。我也是和她一樣的來得太遲血不及進場。不過我眞來得太遲了，竟來不及看她所演怪劇的前半部。這室內是黑黝黝的，她决不想室內除她外還有別人。我想她　使看見我，她是决不　向一個生人提出這樣一個不俗的問題的。我想她也不曾知道，要興探我　這樣深奧的哲理。</p>
<h3>從新啟蒙運動到精神員</h3>
<p>— 同芳</p>
<p>新啟蒙運動是目前最迫切需要推進的一種文化和思想運動。中國的抗戰展到現階段無　的我們需要史强固的民族意議，以完成　國的　　，文化和思想雖屬觀念形態，但它却是社會發展不可缺少的動力，我們今日能够　成想樣强固堅　的民族　戰線，展開這樣偉大抗戰局面，完全由於全國有　一致的抗戰　侮的共同信念和思」。任何思想雖是出自實踐的。可是爲求實踐獲得　效，就應把各種思想加以精密的　討與批判，使與　踐吻合；在全國人民的思想自然的溶應以後，才可以充分地表現出劃一的意見，人力物力也才有完全發揮的可能，所以，在員前的中國基於實踐的發展　要求，從思想與文化上廣泛地　廣新啓蒙運動，統一各方的見解，以建立鞏固的思想陣線，來擊破抗戰期中的各種不傳全的思想掃蕩各種傳統的歪由理論，實在是再迫切沒有的。</p>
<p>從這點上，我們就得重視蔣委員爲昭示給我們的國民精神動員了。在目前抗戰進展到第二個階段，敵人正處於進退維谷，的時候精神動員綱領的提出，不僅可以强　我們的精神意識，貫澈抗戰禦侮的决心，以奠定全國一致的思想的基礎並且還指示出現階段中國思想的共同目標，作爲未來建設新中國的重要準備，我覺得這正和新啟家運動同爲促成國民精　武裝所必需的一運種動。</p>
<p>精神動員　領規定了今日中國國民應盡的任務，又　我們把民族國家視爲了提，集中思想與意志，爲爭取生存而奮鬥：更提出抗戰最後的目的在建立獨立自由平等，民有民治民　的三民主義共和國，革除自私自利的封建思想，建立抗戰期中所必需的新人生觀，可說是精神動員的骨幹，僅就改造國民精神，革除傳統惡習和積極的充　及集中國民意志幾站來說，巳可知精神動員不僅提供了中國今後思想運動所應走的途徑，同時還是民族團結對外的更高　段的發展。由各黨各派各階段的聯合，進而爲思　的統一和精神的集中，因此　是動搖抗戰，破壞國家統一與民族利益的漢奸思想，都應完全廊淸，使民主政治的理想得以實現。</p>
<p>但是我們爲要連到精神動員的各項共同目標，仍須努力堆進大衆的知職運動，亦卽是說，我們不能忽略展　思想上的新啓蒙運動，以完成抗戰建國的最後的任務。</p>
<p>在二期抗戰的過程中，固應注重軍事的發展，而動　整個民族的思想，也是不可忽視的；因此我們迫，地需要掃蕩一切不利抗戰的傳統思想，並　進建設新中國的精神基礎。如果我們承認新啟蒙運動劉於抗戰建國的重要，那麼我們就應接受精神動員綱領，以形成廣大的思想　綫，做實踐的主要依據！凡之</p>
<h3>挖壕溝</h3>
<p>— 凡之</p>
<p>現在我們的游擊隊，聲勢浩大起來了，×軍日夜都感着不安。進攻××的消息，不斷的　進了×人的陣營，他們都惶恐懼怕，只好滐溝高壘，加重防守工作，於是挖戰壕的需要，就刻不容緩了。</p>
<p>挖戰壕需要着大量的人工，他們便下鄉間去，四處强拉民伕，一到人家，看見是男子，無論老的，壯的，都用粗笨的麻繩，一個連一個縛着，一串又一串的牽着走。</p>
<p>在途中走的時候，不准呼叫，不准哭泣，犯了這兩「命令」，就給一頓飽打。若有人企圖脫逃那就會立刻檢斃。到了他們的目的地後，每人分發一柄鐵鋤，或鋤頭，又下令全體動手，開始在他們指定的地方，挖掘，挖掘，不停的挖掘—</p>
<p>晚間呢，是休息的時候了，睡眠的地方，就是自己勞力挖出來的　溝，上面有　氣寒風，不停的襲來，下面是水潦潮泥，冰冽着肌　，餓着肚子，倦着身子，一堆一堆的相　着，站坐，臥，都不安寧，全夜不會有一分鐘的睡眠。</p>
<p>天還未　的時候，又下令工作了：挖掘！挖掘！不停的挖掘！</p>
<p>吃飯呢，每天只有一餐，每人只有一碗飯，重量只有四兩。不但沒有　！而且沒有湯，甚至　子也沒有。　未用手如來吃吧？不！他們的『命令』，是不準用手抓的，只可學狗吃屎樣甩「嘴舐』！誰敢用手抓吃時，馬上就　一刺刀，這　是『薄　」，有時會遭　斃！</p>
<p>到了要大小便時，也不准離開壕溝一步，『命令』是「便」在溝中。</p>
<p>在工作時，不准談笑，就是哭泣也小准，「命令」是堅靜！一遇見監工的×軍來，誰見了誰得鞠躬，還要帶着笑臉的鞠躬，否則卽爲失禮，定會挨陶　耳九。</p>
<p>凡是因爲吃不過×苦飢塞而死的，或是犯了「命令」被打　被殺而死的，「命令』不准移葬，就把屍身充作泥士，堆在壕溝上面，算是加厚尺寸土壘。</p>
<p>總之被拉去的同胞，一切都犧牲在壕溝中：工作在壕溝中，睡眠在壕溝中，大小便在壕溝中，死了也埋在壕溝，—可憐還有一些未死的同胞，伊在敵人强迫之下爲他們挖掘！挖掘—不　的挖掘！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>「那你怎麼不打死我？」</p>
<p>「時間遲了，太遲了！」</p>
<p>「什麼時間？』</p>
<p>「該是昨天的晚上，不是今天。』</p>
<p>她是表示自己留　於今天的一度的友情的。</p>
<p>「你後悔吧？」</p>
<p>「——不！」</p>
<p>感情　波絞，是度限度的：突變的頂點，也祇有一刹那，久了，自然平常。她不哭了，漸漸地恢復了常態，刷牙，洗臉，又開始日常生活的習慣。最後，他安然地走開了。</p>
<p>他和他的同志共同决定一封信，給她的父—大意是　欵五千萬，限三日交到某地某人，這期間，如　意外發生而使送信人遭到不幸……一切都以她的生命担保。他派到一個同志把這信送到她家去。</p>
<p>然後，他又找一個同芯，給她買來兩個小面包和一瓶牛奶作爲早餐。她疑心那牛奶不是　毒的，連小面包也沒有吃，同時，她也因國感覺並不飢餓的緣故。</p>
<p>她為了排遣自已的的聊，無意地走進他們的房間。屋內變了，狼狽了，已經不是昨夜那般的美好。屋內的桌椅，以及一切的用具，都離開了適當的位置集中在一角；讓餘下的空地，曾代替他們過夜的床舖。他們無枕頭，無被褥，祇有一條　毡選摺　在地上。他們起身不久，不及整　，他們在押成一樓摺的衣服，還未舒展　來。他們的人　，比昨夜少了些，現在祇餘下三個人；有的　理着房間，似乎怕有人來看出億　寫的破綻，有的咬着好像　天以前的陳舊的饅頭，吃得格外香甜。那最廉價的　頭，如比之於他們整齊的服裝和富　的付所，的確是一　太不協和的想像的構　，而不近於一頁眞實的　面。因此，引起她一種莫明的與越。</p>

        <h1>1939.04.28</h1>
<h3>The Great International Labor Day — May 1st —</h3>
<p>May 1st, the great Labor Day, holds a glorious, heroic, rich, and combative history both worldwide and in China.</p>
<p>In 1884, American workers convened the Fourth Congress of the American Labor Federation in Chicago, resolving to implement an eight-hour workday by May 1, 1886, or else take direct revolutionary action.</p>
<p>By May 1, 1886, American workers, under the slogan of "Eight-Hour Workday," launched a nationwide strike. Bloody conflicts between workers and police occurred in Chicago and elsewhere, resulting in numerous worker casualties and deaths. Prominent leaders such as Spies were arrested and killed, igniting animosity and fighting spirit among workers throughout America and the world.</p>
<p>In 1889, the Second International convened its First Congress, formally designating May 1st as International Labor Day. From that year onward, the working masses worldwide fervently commemorated May Day, using this day to review their fighting strength, inspect workers and other toiling masses worldwide, demand improved treatment, oppose oppression and exploitation, and strive for socialism, drawing on past experiences and lessons. They fought for the eight-hour workday (as decided by the 1889 Congress), they fought for peace (as decided by the 1891 Congress), and they fought even more for socialism (as decided by the 1893 Congress).</p>
<p>Abroad, the working masses of various countries have commemorated May Day with increasing fervor over the past fifty-three years. Particularly noteworthy is the Russian working masses, who enthusiastically participated in May Day demonstrations and parades against the Tsarist government and the bourgeoisie since 1891. During the era of the European Great War, vast numbers of European laborers were deceived and used as cannon fodder in the imperialist war. Meanwhile, the Russian working masses even more vigorously launched their revolutionary struggle, holding May Day celebrations under the revolutionary Soviet regime from 1918 onward. With the advancement of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the Soviet working masses enthusiastically commemorate May Day every year. They have already realized a seven-hour or even shorter workday, and their labor is no longer for exploitation but for themselves! Their success has influenced the consolidation and expansion of the labor movement in capitalist countries worldwide, and this influence is now growing even greater. In China, with the influx of imperialist capital and the emergence of modern workers, they first commemorated May Day in 1918 (Year 7 of the Republic of China). By 1921 (Year 10 of the Republic of China), the Chinese working masses formally established their own vanguard force, their own political party, shouldering the dual task of the labor movement in semi-colonial China – the historical mission of social and national liberation. Immediately following the formation of the party, in 1923 (Year 12 of the Republic of China), a grand and vigorous May Day demonstration was held in Guangzhou, the base of the revolutionary strategy. On this very day, the First National Labor Congress was convened, establishing the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the highest leadership organ of Chinese workers.</p>
<p>May Day is not only a banner of solidarity for the working masses worldwide but also a banner of solidarity for the working masses of China. It not only guides workers towards the path of happiness in capitalist countries but also guides the working masses towards the path of liberation in colonial and semi-colonial countries.</p>
<p>However, commemorating the great May Day this year carries special and even greater significance and tasks. First, from a global perspective, the flames of fascist wars of aggression threaten workers and all of humanity. Therefore, the working masses worldwide commemorate this year's May Day by opposing fascist wars of aggression, launching an anti-aggression front to defend democracy and peace, and establishing collective security systems in Europe, America, and the Far East as the central slogan of May Day. We want the working masses worldwide to genuinely strive for this central slogan. To effectively oppose fascist wars of aggression, the first central task is for the working class and toiling masses worldwide to achieve unity in action, from trade union movements to workers' political parties. Only the power of the united front of the working class and all toiling masses worldwide can ultimately defeat the fascist aggressors, safeguard world peace and human civilization. Only by defeating the threat of fascist wars of aggression to all of humanity can workers and toiling masses achieve their thorough liberation.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of China, we must first recognize the characteristics of the current political situation, namely: (1) The large-scale war of aggression against China launched by Japanese imperialism has been underway for over twenty months. On one hand, this proves that the forces of the Japanese invasion are still present, and thus the liberation of China's toiling masses cannot be realized. On the other hand, it clarifies that if the toiling masses do not actively participate in the war of resistance and national reconstruction, then China's war of resistance against Japan cannot achieve final victory. (2) Over the past twenty months of resistance, our material consumption has reached alarming figures, while foreign material assistance has been hindered and will face even greater difficulties. Therefore, the importance of increasing production has become even more pronounced. (3) Our national unity in persisting in resistance has aroused sympathy and assistance from the working class and toiling masses worldwide, especially from the Soviet Union, the socialist homeland built by the working class themselves, and their movement to aid China and restrict Japan continues to expand. Organize workers and toiling masses, as much as possible and when necessary, arming the vast toiling masses. The declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang states: "The national revolutionary movement must have the participation of the broad masses, and the workers and peasants are particularly essential." The resolutions of the session also state: "Workers are the most important among the masses. If this is not considered, then the so-called mass base cannot be consolidated." Recently, the highest leader and the National Spiritual Mobilization have placed particular emphasis on the power of workers, hoping to effectively mobilize them. (2) It is necessary to effectively guarantee the freedom of the toiling masses to participate in the war of resistance and national salvation, encourage and give preferential treatment to overseas workers returning to the country to serve. The national and local worker or employee organizations should implement democratic principles as much as possible, and give full play to their enthusiasm and initiative in supporting the government leaders in intensifying production. (3) Promote necessary handicrafts, encourage overseas Chinese and friendly nations to actively invest in this industry, absorb a large number of unemployed and displaced toiling masses, and guarantee their spiritual and material life.</p>
<h3>Commemorations Filled with Bloodshed: May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ××</h3>
<p>The tragic month of May, a day of remembrance never to be forgotten in the hearts of every Chinese person, is marked by commemorations filled with bloodshed – May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ×××××.</p>
<p>These memorial days are all humiliating marks branded on the Chinese nation by Japanese invaders!</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the "May 3rd" Massacre. This occurred in 1928 (Year 17 of the Republic of China) and was a prelude to the "September 18th" Incident. At that time, our National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition had recovered Lincheng and was advancing on Jinan when the Japanese Tanaka Cabinet decided to send troops to Shandong, dispatching 50 warships and 10,000 soldiers, commanded by the 18th Division Commander Fukuda. On April 29th, the Northern Expeditionary Army entered the city of Jinan, and Fukuda's interventionist troops also arrived in Jinan on the same day, confronting the Northern Expeditionary Army. On May 3rd, a battalion commander of the Northern Expeditionary Army wanted to pass through the Japanese military cordon in the city when he was suddenly shot and killed. Following this, the Japanese army carried out a large-scale massacre. They set up heavy artillery and machine guns at important intersections and on buildings in Jinan, firing intensely every few minutes, each time turning countless civilians and soldiers into masses of blood. At that time, Shandong's Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Gong Shishi, was brutally sacrificed because he refused the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side, having his eyes gouged out and his ears and nose cut off! Huang Fu, a pro-Japanese bureaucrat who sought to appease through humiliation, actually agreed to all the demands of the Japanese General Staff and executed the order for the Northern Expeditionary Army to immediately leave Jinan. Although the majority of revolutionary soldiers had joined forces with workers in the city and farmers in the suburbs to continue resisting, they eventually ran out of ammunition and withdrew on the morning of the 11th.</p>
<p>The May 3rd Jinan Massacre was a cruel scene where Japan used feudal warlords to aid reactionary corruption, using large-scale armed forces to block the vigorous development of our national revolution. Due to the implementation of submission, compromise, and concession at the time of the Jinan Massacre, the September 18th Incident occurred two years later, causing the tragedy of Japanese aggressors launching a large-scale attack on China. But at the same time, we must also recognize that the broad revolutionary soldiers, workers, and peasants had already launched a direct war of resistance against Japan at that time, and the student and citizen anti-Japanese national salvation movement subsequently developed dramatically throughout the country. If it had not encountered political resistance, the Japanese aggressors would have suffered a severe blow before September 18th.</p>
<p>Secondly, May 7th and May 9th occurred during the First World War. At that time, Japan ×× took advantage of the European countries being unable to look eastward ×× to first seize Germany's colonies in China, declaring war on Germany in August 1914, wantonly ravaging areas around Longkou, Laizhou, and Jiaozhou in our country. Three months later, it occupied Jiaozhou, controlled the Jiaoji Railway, and threatened our entire Shandong Province. At this time, Yuan Shikai, a feudal remnant manipulating the Beijing government, was plotting to eliminate the revolutionary forces led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and conspiring to restore the monarchy. Japanese ××, believing that only by helping China's reactionary forces could they realize their ambition to annex China, used "supporting Yuan's enthronement" as a condition and sent its ambassador to China to propose the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai on January 18, 1915 (Year 8 of the Republic of China). The demands included Shandong's rights, Japan's position in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia, the rights of the Hanyeping Company, special privileges over China's coastal territories, and even harsh demands on China's internal affairs, all of which were concrete methods to destroy China. At that time, Yuan Shikai half-heartedly bargained, and Japan ××, knowing Yuan Shikai's imperial dream, issued an ultimatum on May 7th, stating that all conditions except Article 5 concerning the Fujian operation agreement must be answered by May 9th. Yuan Shikai, who sought glory by selling out the country, completely agreed under threat and enticement. As a result, the entire country was in uproar, and anti-Yuan and anti-Japanese sentiments shook the country and overseas, vowing not to recognize the "Twenty-One Demands."</p>
<p>"May 7th" and "May 9th" were the first step in Japan's plan to destroy China. At that time, it used international turmoil, our country's feudal remnants, corrupt regimes, and national traitors who sought glory by selling out the country to help reactionary forces suppress the revolutionary national salvation movement. These tactics are still being used today, and they are becoming more ingenious and vicious, such as using Wang Jingwei and others' "anti-communist" and "peace" remarks and actions. When our revolutionary forces rise, their poisonous schemes will become even more rampant! It showed the great power of the working masses transitioning from economic struggle to political struggle. Although the Japanese's united front power was clearly dominant at the time, and we failed to truly unite the government, the army, and the broad masses of peasants, and win international assistance to further develop the struggle, leading to failure; but it had already united the working class, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, and in the continuous tenacious struggle, achieved practical results in economic resistance, and developed the victorious prospect of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927.</p>
<p>The tragic historical facts of May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ×××, and the experiences and lessons learned, indicate to us that in the current new and arduous stage of struggling for the success of the war of resistance and national salvation, we must more clearly recognize that Japanese imperialism is our only and greatest enemy, we must more clearly recognize that the broad masses of workers and peasants are the main force of the national revolution, and at the same time, we must also recognize the great significance of assisting the government's military strength and winning international sympathy and assistance. Therefore, our task in commemorating May 3rd, May 7th, May 9th, ××× this year is first to support the central government, to protect Generalissimo Chiang, and ××××××××××. We must promote the National Spiritual Mobilization, raise national self-esteem and self-confidence, overcome pessimistic and disappointed emotions, and eliminate peaceful compromise rhetoric and actions. The second is to consolidate national unity. We must closely cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, consolidate and expand the unity of all ethnic groups, parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life in the country ××××××××××××××××. The third is to accelerate political progress. We must consolidate the leadership of the Kuomintang and the central government, develop the national economy, improve people's livelihoods ×××××, and promote democratic politics. Only by striving for political progress in the war of resistance can we thoroughly realize the Three Principles of the People and guarantee the success of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People after the war. Fourth, we must strive for international sympathy and assistance. We must strive for more and greater practical results from the anti-aggression front movement that develops and defends democracy and peace, and the international aid to China and restrict Japan movement.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Maintain and Develop the Momentum of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek received reporters on the evening of the 24th, making remarks on military and political matters.</p>
<p>In the military aspect, the Generalissimo specifically pointed out: "The overall counter-offensive has not yet begun." The battles east of the Yuehan and Pinghan Railways should not focus on the gains and losses of one place or one city. He firmly believes that the enemy will find it difficult to hold out for long." These remarks severely corrected those who recently rediscovered the theory of quick victory. We must know that our strength in the war of resistance is indeed progressing daily, and the enemy's operations are indeed deteriorating daily. However, Japan is originally a superior imperialist nation, and we cannot inflict a fatal blow on the enemy with a counter-offensive in a day or two. Our current counter-offensive only strives to take the initiative, contain the enemy's new offensives, overcome the difficulties encountered in the stalemate phase, and facilitate all the preparations for the future overall counter-offensive. Therefore, we must not be negligent about the enemy's offensives, but also redouble our efforts to support our military actions to strive for the initiative and prevent the enemy's offensives. We must also intensify efforts to enhance the strength of the war of resistance, accelerate political progress, and increase the internal and international difficulties for the enemy, and then we can smoothly launch the overall counter-offensive.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, Generalissimo Chiang focused on political training, especially the reform of lower-level administrative institutions, hoping to bring local party and government affairs into a new track, and establish a foundation for democratic centralism, self-defense, and autonomy. This has the same importance as the military counter-offensives on various battlefields. Because whether it is to stop the enemy's offensives or to prepare for the future overall counter-offensive, both rely on the enhancement of the combat effectiveness of the forward troops, the development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and the cultivation of new forces in the rear, and all of these rely on the mobilization of the broad masses. The precise realization of mass mobilization relies on political progress, mainly improving lower-level administrative institutions and the work of the Party. The first step is to remove obstacles to mass mobilization, and on the other hand, give the masses as much democracy and freedom as possible, and give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses to participate in all war of resistance and national reconstruction work. The first step is to establish local public opinion organs as soon as possible, and then intensify the organization and training of the masses, and arm the peasants and workers as much as possible.</p>
<p>The victories of the counter-offensives on various battlefields have already achieved considerable success. First, they have ruthlessly struck the conspiracies of Wang Jingwei and others and the arguments for the failure of the war of resistance politically, boosting the people's confidence in the victory of the war of resistance, raising the attacking spirit of the front-line soldiers, and further exciting international figures' optimistic sympathy and determination to help our country's war of resistance prospects. Secondly, militarily, they have realized "offensive defense," realized "seizing the initiative," realized the prevention and attack of the enemy's new offensives. The overall war of resistance situation has indeed achieved a dominant and advantageous position!</p>
<p>However, we must also recognize that the enemy's advantages have not been completely lost, the enemy's offensive power has not suffered a fatal blow, and they still have the power to coordinate political anti-communist and equalitarian conspiracies, and launch new offensives militarily. Moreover, they have already launched such offensives, mainly aimed at the offensive against Changsha and the threat to Fuzhou and Chaozhou, with the primary goal of opening up the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways and consolidating the occupied areas in East and Southeast China. Therefore, we must not only maintain and develop the dominant position of the current "offensive defense" on various front lines with redoubled efforts, but also launch large-scale guerrilla warfare in the rear of the enemy with redoubled efforts, contain and weaken the enemy, preventing them from advancing and penetrating further. At the same time, we must also prepare new and greater forces, such as establishing new armies, expanding the air force, and developing mechanized units, to prepare for the future overall counter-offensive.</p>
<p>All of these fundamentally require greater political progress and greater diplomatic success. The highest leader has a clear understanding and active effort on this point. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's talk on the 24th, which emphasizes the reform of lower-level political institutions and the establishment of a democratic foundation, truly makes people more confident and pleased with the future of war of resistance and national reconstruction. We hope that the whole country will unanimously support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's great plan to promote greater political progress. We must promote closer cooperation between the various parties, more full and universal implementation of the Three Principles of the People's democratic politics, more resolute and thorough anti-compromise and anti-traitor movements such as the anti-Wang movement, and then promote the mass mobilization and organization work, which began with the National Spiritual Mobilization, to be broader and more lasting, and coordinate it with the promotion of national defense construction, economic construction, and diplomatic work, and the launching of work against the enemy army. If we can intensify these work steps, then we will surely be able to shorten the transition period, and overcome the difficulties of the stalemate phase, increase the enemy's difficulties, and advance the arrival of the comprehensive overall counter-offensive.</p>
<h3>Glorious Commemoration of the Revolutionary Teacher - May 5th</h3>
<p>May is filled with a bloody atmosphere of battle. May 5th also leaves us with painful memories: The first is the humiliating "Shanghai Truce Agreement" of May 5th, 1932 (Year 21 of the Republic of China), caused by the failure to support the "January 28th" Battle to the end. The second is the humiliating Tanggu Truce Agreement of May 5th, 1934, caused by the failure to support the Great Wall Resistance to the end. These agreements have lost their validity today, but our painful experiences and important lessons are still fresh.</p>
<p>In addition to these painful memories, we should propose, with enthusiasm and encouragement: ×××××revolutionary×××××glory××××××. First, on May 5th, 1921 (Year ×× of the Republic), the tenth year after the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, the first Provisional President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen, again assumed the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou, re-establishing the foundation of the Southern Revolutionary Regime. Second, one hundred and twenty-one years ago, on May 5, 1818, a world-renowned figure was born in Europe, the creator of scientific socialism, the teacher of the proletarian revolution, and the ardent advocate of the liberation movement of oppressed nations—Karl Marx.</p>
<p>Our commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen assuming the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou is of great significance today, because Mr. Sun's action had a very important effect on the Chinese Revolution. After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Mr. Sun renamed the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Shanghai to the "Chinese Kuomintang," taking "Consolidating the Republic and Implementing the Three Principles of the People" as its political program, and also wrote the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" and founded the "Construction" magazine. After assuming the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou on May 5, 1921, ××××××××××××××××××××Mr. Sun personally went to Guangxi to prepare for the Northern Expedition, and in Guangxi, he met with M.I. Manuilsky, the representative of the Communist International. Next, in 1922, the Soviet representative Joffe came to China and signed the "Sun-Joffe Manifesto"××××××××××××××××××××. The Chinese Kuomintang began a thorough reorganization from 1923 to 1924. In the autumn of that year, Mr. Sun gathered progressive revolutionary figures (including Chen Duxiu) in Shanghai to draft a reorganization plan for the Kuomintang, and on January 1, 1923, he published the Kuomintang Declaration, defining the revolutionary direction for the future. The main points were: (1) revising unequal treaties to restore China's free and equal status in the international community; (2) implementing a universal suffrage system, abolishing class elections based on property standards; (3) affirming the people's absolute freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief; (4) formulating a workers' protection law to improve the living conditions of laborers, improving rural organizations, improving farmers' lives, and affirming the equality of women and men; and (5) the state formulates land law, the use of land law and land value tax law. In October 1923, the Kuomintang published a reorganization declaration and began to implement the reorganization movement. The Kuomintang Provisional Central Executive Committee was established in Guangzhou, and Borodin was hired as a consultant. Immediately afterwards, the Kuomintang held its First National Congress in Guangzhou on January 20, 1924, to discuss: (1) reorganizing the Kuomintang, passing the new political program, the new party constitution, and the declaration; (2) passing the plan to establish the National Government; (3) allowing the Communist Party and the Socialist Youth League to join the Kuomintang. As a result of the Congress, a clear political program was established for the Kuomintang, taking ××××××××××××××××warlords as the central task of the struggle, and taking alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for farmers and workers as its policies.</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen assuming the position of Extraordinary President, as we look back at Guangzhou, which has become a haunted region, we cannot but recall the wise men of the past. We must sincerely accept the Three Principles of the People left to us by Mr. Sun, and implement the central task of solving China's problems - the task of striving for national independence, civil rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness. We must sincerely follow the three major policies left to us by Mr. Sun, consolidating the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the unity of all China, consolidating Sino-Soviet cooperation and the unity of democratic and peaceful countries around the world, and earnestly implement the policy of supporting farmers and workers, mobilizing the power of farmers and workers to support the great cause of war of resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, we must inherit Mr. Sun's spirit of never reconciling and never compromising with the anti-revolutionary forces.</p>
<p>Regarding Marx's greatness, Lenin and Mr. Sun Yat-sen both gave clear explanations. Lenin said: "All the genius of Marxism lies in the fact that it answered the questions already raised by human progressive thought. His theory is the direct continuation of the philosophies, political economics, and the great representatives of socialism's theories." Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Marx's writings and the theories he invented can be said to be the culmination of thousands of years of human thought."</p>
<p>The great works of scientific socialism left to us by Marx are just like the Three Principles of the People and the three major policies left to us by Sun Yat-sen. In this difficult and dangerous stage of the eve of the transition to victory in the overall war of resistance, we must accept them with the greatest enthusiasm, study them, use them to arm our minds, and seek correct social science knowledge. At present, we must redouble our efforts in the study of Marxism, draw lessons and experience from the international workers' movement, cooperate with the practice of national reconstruction movement, and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the construction of the "Republic of China - Freedom, Equality, Fraternity."</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Money Continues to Depreciate; Legal Tender Rises Steadily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] News from Beiping reports that in recent days, the banknotes of the "North China Reserve Bank" have continued to depreciate, while at the same time, Chinese legal tender has risen uniformly.

<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] After the Ministry of Finance borrowed 10 million pounds from British banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chinese banks such as Bank of Communications and others, it established a Balance Fund Management Committee. The value of legal tender has become more stable, and foreign exchange reserves have become more abundant. The entire financial situation is becoming more stable, further strengthening the war of resistance, and benefiting trade with China from various countries. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Legal Tender Issuance Policy</p>
<p>The legal tender issuance policy of the four major banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, is particularly cautious. The total issuance in June 1937 was 1.4 billion yuan, and in June 1938, it was 1.727 billion yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan. Some people consider this an example of currency inflation. However, in reality, after the center of the war of resistance shifted inland, provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan switched to using legal tender. Commercial credit contracted and switched to cash transactions. The proliferation of counterfeit currency in the occupied areas increased the hoarding of legal tender. Commodity supply and demand imbalances led to rising prices, increasing the need for banknotes. These are all reasons for the necessary increase in legal tender issuance. Shanghai, on the other hand, has a sense of aversion to currency contraction, such as the increase in remittance rates. Therefore, the government has not excessively issued legal tender and has been able to maintain the value of legal tender at a stable level.</p>
<p>People's Confidence and Ample Reserves</p>
<p>After the legal tender policy was implemented, the people unanimously expressed their confidence. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the value of legal tender has been closely related to the increase or decrease of individual wealth, generating an especially enthusiastic atmosphere. Apart from a very small number of mad speculators, no one does not want the foundation of legal tender to be solid, benefiting both the country and themselves. Everyone considers it shameful to exchange legal tender for foreign currency. The cash reserves of legal tender have always been above 60%. Our US dollar reserves in the United States, as of the end of last June, were estimated to be 84 million US dollars. In addition to these foreign exchange reserves, the value of legal tender in foreign exchange will likely remain within the current exchange rate range without huge fluctuations. The remaining silver reserves in the country can be used to increase the legal tender reserves by 200 million yuan, while maintaining the current foreign exchange rate for more than two years.</p>
<p>Effective Management and Improved Trade</p>
<p>The Central Bank's management of foreign exchange affairs ensures that legitimate commercial needs are met, while those who attempt to evade foreign exchange controls are not approved. The gate for capital flight is closed. Foreign exchange earned from export trade is sold to government banks at the legal exchange rate, reducing imports of foreign goods and achieving trade balance. Coupled with the government's vigorous promotion of wartime frugality, there have been months with trade surpluses. At the same time, overseas Chinese, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have increased remittances, preventing drastic fluctuations in our international balance of payments. This has a powerful, although indirect, effect on maintaining the value of legal tender.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Banks Help Maintain Stability</p>
<p>In times of war, maintaining financial stability in our country is an indispensable strategy. The friendly foreign banks' joint efforts to maintain foreign exchange stability are also a well-known fact. Each time the foreign exchange market experiences fluctuations, Chinese and foreign banks immediately provide large amounts of foreign exchange, resulting in a renewed trend toward stability in the value of legal tender. In October of last year, when Guangzhou and Wuhan successively fell, the legal tender exchange market was not affected in the slightest. Furthermore, funds fleeing to Hong Kong flowed back to Shanghai, causing the legal tender exchange rate to rise instead. The Japanese and puppet regimes' attempts to destroy the legal tender plan ultimately failed. Legal tender still circulates within the occupied areas, and its value remains above that of counterfeit money.</p>
<h3>Outline of Propaganda for Guerrilla Areas (3) Issued by the Political Department of the Military Commission</h3>
<p>(Sixteen) Broadly publicize and explain the articles of the "Public Agreement on Military-Civilian Cooperation" formulated by this department, ensuring that the military and civilians abide by them consistently, so as to "fully establish the crucial element of our victory over the aggressors."</p>
<p>(B) Key Points for Propaganda Directed at Troops in the War Zone</p>
<p>(1) Abide by Chairman Chiang's instruction: "The second phase of the War of Resistance is when we shift from defense to offense, and turn defeat into victory." Highlight the characteristics of the second strategic phase, explaining that the second phase of operations follows the exhaustion and weakening of the enemy in the first phase, and is the period to "shift from defense to offense and realize the dream of destroying the aggressors and causing them to fail (Chairman Chiang's words)" after "the completion of all arrangements in our strategic plan to strive for final victory (Chairman Chiang's words)" to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>(2) Regular troops stationed behind enemy lines must dispatch small units when necessary to engage in guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla units that grow and expand in the war zone can also assemble several detachments to form regular troops. There is no absolute boundary between the two. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that both sides understand the need to mutually learn the functions necessary for each other.</p>
<p>(3) The war zone in the second phase of the War of Resistance is even larger, the front lines are even longer, transportation is even more difficult, and the enemy's forces are even more dispersed, inevitably leading to a situation where they cannot attend to everything. This provides us with many exploitable gaps. Therefore, in our operations, we must strengthen the coordination and communication of operations on all sides, and strive to cultivate a spirit of love and mutual assistance between troops and friendly forces to ensure the victory of our operations.</p>
<p>(4) Military operations without the help of the people rarely achieve victory. Troops remaining behind enemy lines, especially guerrilla units, must rely on the love, support, and backing of the people. Therefore, troops in the war zone must have good discipline. "Based on the experiences in various places during the first phase of the War of Resistance, as long as the government has good methods for seeking the cooperation of the people, the people invariably comply gladly. It is clear that only the troops can fail the people, not the people the troops (Minister's words)." Therefore, political workers in units behind enemy lines must publicize and explain more, and infinitely improve the troops' automatic political discipline and military discipline.</p>
<p>(A) Political Discipline: Ensure that the unit, when stationed in a locality, (1) publicizes during entries and exits, (2) cleans up after fighting, (3) returns borrowed items, (4) compensates for losses, (5) engages in fair trade, (6) speaks politely, (7) strictly observes all regulations of the New Life Movement, and (8) respects good folk customs, so that the people do not dislike the troops and strive to realize the principle of "service is propaganda," earnestly help the people solve difficulties, serve the people, and win the goodwill of the people.</p>
<p>(B) Military Discipline: Absolutely obey superiors and strictly execute orders. Cultivate the habit of "officers and soldiers valuing orders more than life." Endure hardship and be industrious, always manage and care for subordinates, be loving and helpful to friendly forces, be diligent and study at all times, and cultivate the ability to exert "everyone fighting on their own" in difficult circumstances. Cherish bullets, firearms, livestock, tools, and so on.</p>
<p>(5) Troops in the war zone should assume the task of establishing and consolidating revolutionary political power and organizing the revolutionary masses. Therefore, they must adhere to the principle of "propaganda is education," cultivate cadres, and ensure that every officer and soldier can become a propagandist and organizer of the masses. Based on their acquired knowledge and skills, they should publicize, educate, and organize the masses in order to expand the effect of political work and consolidate our political power.</p>
<p>(6) Troops in the war zone, especially guerrilla units, frequently operate behind enemy lines. The enemy will certainly use all sorts of methods to "suppress" us and use divisive, coercive, and enticing tactics to disintegrate us. Therefore, every combatant or other worker must be constantly educated about the certainty of victory in the War of Resistance, raising their cultural level, constantly correcting their incorrect concepts and views, and constantly enlightening them to have a correct understanding.</p>
<p>(7) For scattered soldiers and stragglers scattered in the war zone, and even vagrants and bandits, we must find ways to take them in and use propaganda and education methods to persuade and educate them, so that they get on the right track and are not exploited by the enemy.</p>
<p>(8) Cooperate with the people to eliminate traitors and enemy spies. Those who can turn over a new leaf and no longer work for the enemy should be allowed to surrender in accordance with the government's promulgated measures for traitors to surrender themselves, and be exempted from punishment.</p>
<p>(C) Key Points for Propaganda Directed at the People in the War Zone: In addition to the outline of propaganda for the people of the whole country and the common propaganda points mentioned above, the following items must be noted in the propaganda directed at the people in the war zone:</p>
<p>(1) First, always reveal the specific facts of the enemy officials' deceptive behavior and conspiracies to incite the people's hatred for the enemy. In particular, always point out (preferably using examples of our victory over the enemy) the enemy's crises and weaknesses, eliminate the people's fear of the enemy, and encourage the people to help destroy the enemy's transportation, disrupt all of the enemy's political, economic, and cultural measures, and even join guerrilla units to fight the enemy. We must educate the people through practical work.</p>
<p>(2) We must awaken the people behind enemy lines, raise their vigilance, and not be deceived or anesthetized by the enemy. (1) Do not attend schools or various training courses run by the enemy and traitors. Do not read newspapers, magazines, and all propaganda materials published by the enemy and traitors. And mobilize various teachers to lead their students in the war zone to resist the enemy's puppet missionaries, in order to crush the enemy and traitors' enslavement education policy. (2) Do not believe the enemy's false propaganda. After understanding the enemy's deceptive propaganda, you should tell others so that they will not be deceived again, in order to crush the enemy's 麻醉 policy. (3) Promote the New Life Movement and prohibit bad habits such as the use of drugs (such as morphine and white powder) and prostitution in order to crush the enemy's cultural policy.</p>
<p>(3) Publicize to the people the practice and preparation for the "empty city strategy."</p>
<p>(4) Helping the people build culture in the war zone means helping the people in the place of residence restore and build schools, establish literacy classes, etc., in order to improve the culture in the war zone and eliminate illiteracy. The main goal is to improve the people's national consciousness, cultivate service habits, encourage the spirit of sacrifice, and fulfill the mission of national spiritual mobilization.</p>
<p>(5) Vigorously promote increased production and long-term improvement of the people's lives to increase the strength of the long-term War of Resistance. Political workers should lead the troops to help the people with production labor in their spare time, thoroughly implementing the principle of "service is propaganda" in order to expand the impact of propaganda.</p>
<p>(6) For military service propaganda, attention should be paid to the environment of the war zone. Conscription is not easy to carry out in the war zone. We should encourage the people to volunteer and join the army or guerrilla units in order to achieve the purpose of military service propaganda. (7) We should cultivate many passionate young cadres in propaganda and education to supplement and expand our military and political strength in the war zone.</p>
<p>(D) Key Points for Propaganda Directed at the Enemy and Puppet Forces</p>
<p>(1) Propaganda work directed at the enemy is a direct attack on the enemy in political warfare. It attacks the enemy from the spiritual aspect, shaking their will to fight, disintegrating their morale, and promoting the trend that is beginning of anti-war mutinies and awakening to the truth. Its effect is sometimes three times greater than the effect of operations.</p>
<p>(2) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, propaganda directed at the enemy is not only more necessary, but also has a greater possibility of being carried out smoothly. First, the war of aggression is not for the benefit of the entire people, but for the benefit of a small number of privileged classes, that is, a small number of ambitious military leaders (the violent factions within the military), a small number of greedy financial groups (the capitalists of the military industry), and some bureaucratic politicians and shameless writers. Even within the military leaders and financial groups, there are often open and covert struggles due to uneven distribution of spoils. At the same time, the people of Japan also resent the tyranny of the military and are engaging in anti-war struggles. This provides us with space to carry out propaganda directed at the enemy. Second, because of China's heroic War of Resistance, the Japanese warlords' strategy of a "quick war and quick victory" and their conspiracy of a "quick end to the war" have failed. The indefinite extension of the war has made Japan internationally isolated, financially troubled, economically depressed, and the people's burden has become heavier and their lives have become more difficult. Therefore, the people's anti-war sentiment and the soldiers' war-weariness are increasing day by day. This facilitates our carrying out of propaganda directed at the enemy.</p>

<h3>British Conscription Bill Submitted to the House of Commons for Debate Chamberlain Explains Reasons for Implementation To Cope with Tense Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] The House of Commons will debate the government's proposal tomorrow, which is to implement compulsory military training to safeguard national security and cope with the situation in Europe. At the same time, the government is seeking new powers to limit the profits of arms factories and prevent individuals from amassing great wealth from the war. After holding a special meeting in the House of Commons, the Labor Party decided to propose the following amendment: "Although the British government has taken the necessary steps to seek national security and fulfill international obligations, the House of Commons expresses regret over the government's destruction of the principle of voluntary service, as this move is not unable to supply the manpower needed for national defense." The Liberal Party has also drafted a similar amendment.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent said that most members of the House of Commons expressed relief at the government's announcement of conscription. The opposition Liberal Party will minimize criticism of the government as much as possible. The Labor Party will remain silent except for the opinions expressed in the House of Commons, and wait for the government bill to be submitted tomorrow. As for the general political situation, the scope of national efforts has been expanded, so it is not surprising if Chamberlain expands the basis of the cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Chamberlain explained the decision to implement conscription in the House of Commons today, saying that national mobilization should be carried out during wartime, but the current situation is still extremely unstable, so it seems appropriate to take certain defensive steps, while avoiding causing major disturbances to the country due to the mobilization order. Therefore, the government authorities decided to propose a reserve and supplementary service bill, on the one hand, to simplify the procedure, and on the other hand, to enable the government to authorize various military agencies to summon reserves and supplementary service members of any year to enlist after receiving an order from the cabinet meeting. This bill is a temporary measure, and it is hoped that Congress will speedily pass it so that the government can implement it. European governments all have this power, and at the same time, some are using this power to partially mobilize. Chamberlain also said that the guarantees we recently provided to certain countries and the discussions with foreign governments that are still in progress are not to engage in war, but to prevent war. Since we keep this purpose in mind, we have to adopt the opinions of democratic countries, especially friendly European countries, and think that we should strive to expand our military. However, if Britain can accept the principle of compulsory military service, this is almost the normal situation on the European continent, then the determination to resist armed dictatorship can be made clear to the world. Is it not a major weakness of the voluntary service system if we see neighboring countries actively training and preparing for war, while we are still at peace? I also thought that compulsory conscription would not be implemented in peacetime, so I have repeatedly stated the promise made by Baldwin that compulsory conscription would not be proposed in peacetime during this parliamentary session. Although there is no war yet, all countries are exhausting their financial resources to prepare for war. Everyone knows that war is inevitable. The dividing line between so-called peacetime and wartime is getting closer. The government's conclusion is that in order to cope with the above-mentioned new and exceptional circumstances, the step of compulsory military training has become necessary for the time being. I say temporarily because I want to state that the government's recommendation in the military training bill will be temporary. The bill will designate three years, but it can be terminated by cabinet order. Conversely, if it is unanimously passed by the House of Commons after three years, it can be extended for another year. The bill will be submitted next week. The competent departments are currently secretly studying the prices of ordnance in order to determine the fairest profit. The government believes that private individuals should never profit from wartime when a major war breaks out. " Opposition Labor Party leader Attlee asked Chamberlain whether he was aware that the government's decision had broken its promise. Attlee said that this would not only increase expenditure, but also lead to class divisions and face fierce opposition. Attlee even had opposition members boo and shout "Chamberlain resign!" In response, the Prime Minister said that he felt clear in his conscience, and that he firmly believed that the people of the world, if they could put themselves in his shoes, would admit that we are not in a peaceful environment. Chamberlain also said that he would submit the issue tomorrow for open debate. Sinclair asked the Prime Minister why he did not consult with the opposition and labor unions before suddenly changing his promise. Chamberlain replied that the world had changed so rapidly that it was not intentional to ignore or disrespect the opposition.</p>
<h3>United States Relieved Believes Britain Prepared to Defend the Country Guarantee European Democracy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Diplomatic circles here are relieved by Britain's implementation of conscription, believing that it has supplemented its past verbal opposition to aggression. Senator King said, "Britain's implementation of conscription shows Hitler and the Nazi and Fascist sides that Britain is prepared to defend its country and guarantee democracy in Europe."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The official impression here of Britain's move to implement conscription is quite good, believing that it can prompt small countries to adhere to British and French policies. At the same time, any country that intends to launch an aggressive action against other countries can delay the action because of this. Diplomats said that this move is unprecedented in Britain, and it is different from the past when they merely exhorted authoritarian countries with empty words. Impartial observers believe that the European situation in general is slightly worse than before, as can be seen from Hitler's refusal to meet with the British ambassador. At the same time, Hitler's inquiries to various countries, most of which stated that they were not threatened, were favorable to Germany. Therefore, his speech tomorrow may be more firm. Democratic Senator King said that the European democratic forces should find ways to strengthen their determination to fight for democracy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] After Britain decided to implement conscription, people from all walks of life in the United States expressed dissatisfaction. Everyone is concerned that if the countries in Europe attempt to use force to change the situation in the future, Britain has decided to use all methods to resist it. This can be clearly demonstrated by the country's implementation of conscription. Moreover, this is a sign that Britain is determined to abandon its advisory policy. The security guarantees recently provided by Britain and France to small countries in Europe will be more trusted by the small countries because of this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Newspapers here have not yet criticized Britain's decision to implement conscription, and will probably wait until the British constituencies and self-governing colonies express any reaction before commenting. Prime Minister Chamberlain's reasons for adopting conscription at this time is that he believes that it is not a time of peace. This will undoubtedly cause his efforts to make all sectors of the country sacrifice for the country in the same way. American newspapers have recently paid close attention to the alleged discovery of improper profiteering in Britain's rearmament and air defense facilities. The US Congress is also planning to take various measures to take away the profits obtained by merchants from the war and to concentrate resources and personnel in the event of war. Many people speculate that the British people will also follow suit and demand the same measures from their government.</p>
<h3>French Comments A Diplomatic Victory for Daladier Polish Political Circles Unanimously Praise</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] The newspapers here regard Britain's adoption of conscription as a major diplomatic victory for Daladier. The whole country is delighted, believing that this is a true ultimatum to Hitler. Daladier has repeatedly urged Britain to adopt conscription and take responsibility since the middle of last month. At present, the union of Britain and France has increased its strength by 10 million people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The "Debate" newspaper here believes that Chamberlain's announcement of Britain's implementation of conscription is "an extremely important event." Also, "The Times" stated, "Britain's decision to conscript today and its budget speech yesterday both show that Britain is fulfilling its responsibilities to itself and the international community with all its spiritual and material strength. If Germany believes that Britain's adoption of conscription is a provocation, then it is a serious mistake."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] After Britain implemented conscription, French officials all expressed extreme satisfaction. This is an unprecedented move in British history. Through this move, all countries that uphold independence and territorial integrity and are threatened have automatically accepted Britain's guarantee of obligations. This decision to implement conscription will show its determination to fulfill its obligations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 26th] After the British cabinet decided to implement conscription, Polish politicians unanimously praised it, saying that this is the first sound of Britain's implementation of a new policy.</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Relations Germany Believes It Is More Difficult to Improve Italy Attaches Importance to British Conscription</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson visited the German Foreign Ministry today to inform the German authorities of the British government's determination to implement conscription.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] Newspapers here unanimously denounced Britain's decision to adopt conscription as absurd. The headline of the "Extraordinary Evening Post" was, "The British's New Language to Germany - Chamberlain's Ridiculous Threat - Britain Announces Limited Conscription."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Political circles here believe that the British government's decision to conscript is enough to increase the tension of the current situation, especially the Anglo-German relations, which are more difficult to improve. Hitler will give a speech on Friday, presenting Germany's response to the incident. Some believe that British conscription cannot be immediately regarded as having military significance, and should be regarded as a gesture. The German press described Britain's decision as a weak threat, which had no impact on Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 26th] The British chargé d'affaires visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon and formally informed him of Britain's decision to implement conscription. Political circles here commented that Britain's move had no practical effect, and that the country's army lacked staff and will remain insignificant for the next few years. If a war were to break out at this moment, the existing balance of power in Europe would not be changed by this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] Italy is deeply impressed by Britain's determination to implement conscription, confirming that this move indicates that Britain is prepared to adhere to its resolute attitude and will no longer yield. Newspapers mostly believe that the move is the result of France's urging.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 27th] Britain's decision to adopt conscription is taken very seriously here. People here admit that Britain is prepared to take a tough stance and no longer make concessions. Newspapers unanimously said that the British government's move was entirely due to pressure from France, not the public opinion of the British people.</p>
<h3>United States Expanding Air Force Secretary of War Signs Contract with Manufacturers Thompson Advocates Abolishing Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Roosevelt today requested Congress to allocate 32 million US dollars from the 66,800,000 US dollars in the naval aircraft base construction fee bill to start the construction of naval aircraft bases.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The Air Force Expansion Act has been signed into law by President Roosevelt. The main points stipulate the construction of 3,532 aircrafts with 372,000,000 US dollars, so as to increase the total number of army aircraft to 6,000. Assistant Secretary of War Johnson recently ordered 571 aircrafts from various aircraft factories in accordance with this law, requiring a total of 50,000,000 US dollars. According to the number of orders placed by the Department of the Army with various factories at one time over the years, this is the largest ever.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Secretary of War Johnson signed a contract with five aircraft manufacturers today to implement the plan to increase the number of army warplanes to 6,000. The value of the contract is 50 million US dollars. Johnson also said that the contract signed today is the largest in the history of the air force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Political commentator Thompson was invited yesterday to express his views on the Neutrality Act to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He advocated abolishing the Neutrality Act so that the United States could maintain the greatest freedom when adopting military legislation or diplomatic actions to deal with international issues. He also said that if we ignore the world situation, it is tantamount to inviting the scourge of aggression. The current Neutrality Act is not neutral.</p>
<p>American Ships Heading East Sailing into the Canal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] Most of the ships of the US fleet were transferred from the Atlantic to the military bases on the Pacific coast. Several of its advance destroyers have sailed near the Panama Canal. A large fleet of ships will arrive at the river later. The authorities have recently ordered merchant ships to suspend transit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Congressman Emerson stated yesterday at the House Foreign Affairs Committee that American sailors strongly advocated an embargo on goods to Japan, because if Western sailors wanted to transport scrap iron for cargo ships bound for Japan, there were often young Chinese children implementing pickets on the docks, appealing not to supply Japan with scrap iron. Their situation is pitiful.</p>
<h3>Part of the British Fleet Heading to Greece</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Athens, 26th] Part of the ships of the British Mediterranean Fleet arrived at Kalamata Port in Greece today. Another team of British warships is anchored in Navarino Port in Greece.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The battleship "Prince of Wales" has been completed and is scheduled to be launched on the 3rd of next month. The ship has a displacement of 35,000 tons, is equipped with ten 14-inch caliber cannons, and is equipped with aircraft. The entire ship can carry 1,500 soldiers, and its speed exceeds that of the battleship "Nelson."</p>
<h3>A German Fleet Sailing to Portuguese Waters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lisbon, 26th] A German fleet, which departed from Kiel Port on the 18th, arrived in Portuguese waters this morning. It includes one battleship, one cruiser, five destroyers, and three submarines. The warships will first visit various ports in Spain and then come to this port for visits before the 6th of next month.</p>
<h3>Soviet Diplomatic Activities Maisky Returns to London via France Potemkin Talks with Bulgarian Prime Minister Is Visiting Turkey and Heading to Southern Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] It is learned that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky is currently on his way back to London from Moscow. He will make a brief stop in Paris to inform the Soviet Ambassador to France of the progress of the Anglo-Soviet talks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bulgarian Capital, 26th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissioner Potemkin left this afternoon for the Turkish capital after conducting talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov this morning. He will return here for a short stay on the way back. People generally believe that the Soviet Union's sudden concern for Bulgaria is of profound significance and attach great importance to it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bulgarian Capital, 26th] The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister had extremely important talks with the Bulgarian Prime Minister in the Bulgarian capital. He will stay here for three or four days after visiting the Romanian capital. He said that he was very satisfied with Bulgaria's hospitality.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Romanian Capital, 26th] After Potemkin's visit to Turkey, he will come here again on his way back. By then, Foreign Minister Gafencu will have returned from Western Europe and will be able to hold talks with him.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech Today: Draft Completed, Strong Stance; Rejection of U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>Hitler</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] According to reliable sources, Hitler has notified Ribbentrop, Goebbels, and Goering that his speech in Parliament tomorrow will formally reject Roosevelt's proposal. It is understood that Hitler will also make a general response to the smaller countries that have replied to his questions. Hitler's speech will remain , without initiating any suggestions for negotiations. The speech may elaborate on previous plans and developments of the anti-communist front.</p>
<p>[Berlin, 27th] External news: Well-informed sources claim that Hitler's speech in Parliament tomorrow will condemn Roosevelt for unwarranted interference in German policy, and will indicate that his public proposal does not warrant a formal response. The draft of Hitler's speech has been completed and is now being translated into English, French, and Italian. The entire process will last an hour and a half. It is understood that Hitler will elaborate on the following key points in his speech: (1) That Nazi Germany's policies for the past six years have been entirely devoted to the struggle for world peace, and has repeatedly proposed disarmament, the signing of non-aggression pacts, and the protection of international borders; (2) That the Treaty of Versailles is an "enemy of world peace," and that the United States' persistent insistence on maintaining this treaty is inappropriate; (3) That Roosevelt's proposal is a degeneration of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, a product of the Washington Conference, and now merely "waste paper." Roosevelt's actions are "abnormal"; (4) That Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was in accordance with the wishes of the Czech people, and that only by annexing Czechoslovakia can peace in Europe be maintained; (5) To clarify that no foreigners may interfere with Germany's implementation of all domestic and foreign policies; (6) To urge Roosevelt, before interfering in German policy, to first address the internal disputes in the United States. "Stabilizing bandits and relieving unemployment" are the key tasks for the United States; (7) To condemn Roosevelt's proposal to guarantee the borders of 31 countries as "selfish" and disregarding Germany's "legitimate" demands for colonies and commercial development; (8) To reiterate that Germany has no intention of attacking others, but to express that Germany is prepared to resist any country that aids the Soviet Union or forms an alliance with the Soviet Union; (9) To claim that the United States has not contributed to world peace, and that it is Germany, not Roosevelt, that truly maintains world peace; (10) In conclusion, to state that Roosevelt's failure to weave a net against the scourge of communism makes him an "enemy of culture."</p>
<p>[Berlin, 26th] External news: The German government has announced that the content of Hitler's speech in Parliament tomorrow has been fully agreed upon. When Hitler drives to the opera house, there will be very few pedestrians on the road, as Goebbels has ordered all factory workers, shop employees, and students to gather and listen to the Fuhrer's broadcast speech. It is heard that Hitler has prepared to speak during the day so that newspapers around the world can publish his speech the next morning and hear the reactions of various countries. The draft of Mr. Hitler's speech has been completed. Reuters has learned that Hitler will respond to Britain's implementation of conscription in this speech. This parliamentary meeting will be the largest in German history, with 862 representatives participating, including five representatives from Bohemia and Moravia, and two representatives from Merville, attending the parliamentary meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] It is heard that well-informed sources say that if Hitler's speech tomorrow presents counter-demands, or completely rejects Roosevelt's call for a worldwide economic and disarmament conference, President Roosevelt may once again express concrete plans regarding opinions.</p>
<h3>European Situation Gradually Worsening: British Ambassador Not Received by German Foreign Minister; France Notifies Germany to Resist Threats</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Today in the British House of Commons, a member asked whether the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, will meet with the German Foreign Minister, Ribbentrop, before Hitler's speech. Chamberlain replied that a senior official from the German Foreign Office has already met with Henderson, but meeting with the German Foreign Minister is very difficult to arrange. However, Henderson is expected to meet with Ribbentrop. Labor member Berenjoe said that the German Foreign Minister cannot receive Henderson due to lack of time, is this to embarrass him? Chamberlain replied that he did not think so, as the German Foreign Minister is indeed very busy due to the visit of the Yugoslav Foreign Minister. When asked whether Henderson carried important documents to the German government, Chamberlain said that the government has not instructed Henderson to make any proposals to the German government. "We believe that the ambassador should return to his post and report the development of our diplomatic policy to the German government," he said.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] British Ambassador Henderson was recently forced to hand his diplomatic note to the Foreign Ministry Secretary, Mr. Huick, without being received by the German Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Opinions from observers in China indicate that the situation has slightly worsened today due to Hitler's refusal to meet with the British Ambassador.

<h3>U.S. Interior Secretary Speech</h3>
<p>Condemns Totalitarian States</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes stated in a speech to the American Culture Freedom Association today that we warmly welcome German scientists, artists, and writers who are now residing in the United States as deeply cultured and civilized figures. The United States is enriched by having approximately four hundred such refugees. They have personally witnessed the "ravages of destroying personality, destroying culture, destroying spirit, and even cruelly killing humanity" in their own countries. However, the light of freedom will surely enter, even in the totalitarian countries of Europe. Ickes also stated that "certain" European countries have obliterated the truth and demeaned the history of mankind. Official report claims agreement.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Anti-British Sentiment in Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>The Reuters dispatch from Peiping of the 27th states: "The anti-British movement in various parts of North China has not subsided. According to Japanese reports, even Inner Mongolia has anti-British rallies, and the main anti-British propagandists are Japanese. At the same time, foreign reporters who opened were also present yesterday to witness the acting governor of the puppet province appointed by the Japanese deliver a speech vehemently attacking Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Most noteworthy is that the Japanese did not invite British reporters to tour Kaifeng with the German reporters. According to eyewitnesses, the speech held by the acting governor was typed by a Japanese typewriter."</p>
<p>Japan's widespread instigation of anti-British movements in the militarily occupied areas did not begin today, but recently it has become increasingly intense. What we should pay attention to today are the following points: (1) This anti-British movement is purely planned by the Japanese and has nothing to do with China, even our compatriots in the occupied areas oppose it. (2) In addition to Japanese planning, although it also involves France and the Soviet Union, it only attacks Britain. This is undoubtedly to avoid friction with the United States in order to continue obtaining supplies of military materials from the United States for the Japanese military.</p>
<p>Japan's expansion of anti-British sentiment in the occupied areas has the following main purposes: (1) To undermine the friendship between China and the United States; (2) To undermine the solidarity of democratic and peaceful countries; (3) To threaten Britain and make it stop the aid-China movement; (4) To coerce and lure Britain to negotiate with Japan and mediate the Sino-Japanese war, pressuring China to yield.</p>
<p>In this regard, we should expand propaganda and mobilize public opinion to point out Japan's conspiracy, and point out that only by strengthening aid to China and only by China's victory in the war of resistance can we effectively guarantee Britain's interests in China and even the entire Far East; any policy of compromise will only help Japan to further recklessly threaten. Britain is currently launching an anti-aggression front movement in Europe, and we must call on all sectors in China and abroad to jointly launch this movement to extend to the Far East.</p>

<h3>International Situation Unpredictable: British Fleet Gathered in Hong Kong; Totalling 16 Warships and Submarine Squadron; Flagship HMS Kent to Return to Hong Kong Next Month</h3>
<p>Although the recent international situation has not reached an extremely tense stage, crises abound and the situation is unpredictable. Preparations should be made. The recent concentration of the British Fleet in Hong Kong, with British warships fully deployed in the sea off the naval dockyard, can also be seen as a preparatory measure. The British ships currently stationed in Hong Kong include three cruisers, nine destroyers, three shallow-water gunboats, one supply ship, a submarine tender, and the Fourth Submarine Squadron. The number of British ships concentrated in Hong Kong is unprecedented. At the same time, there are also four U.S. ships anchored in Hong Kong, in addition to the flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, USS Augusta, the other three are shallow-water gunboats, USS Mindanao, USS Tulsa, and USS Edsall. The current British ships registered in Hong Kong are as follows: (Cruisers) HMS Kent, HMS Birmingham, HMS Cardiff, (Supply Ship) HMS Resource, (Shallow-water Gunboats) HMS Robin, HMS Scarab, HMS Seamew, (Submarines) Submarine Tender HMS Medway, and the Fourth Submarine Squadron, (Destroyers) HMS Duncan, HMS Grimsby, HMS Dainty, HMS Decoy, HMS Electra, HMS Diamond, HMS Scout, HMS Whitshed, HMS Tenedos. According to Hong Kong naval sources yesterday, the former flagship cruiser HMS Kent, which had returned to the UK for refurbishment, recently set sail from the UK to rejoin the China Squadron and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. After the ship arrives in Hong Kong, the newly appointed Commander of the Fifth Cruiser Squadron, Rear Admiral Murray, will transfer to the ship. After HMS Kent joins the fleet, its sister ship, HMS Cumberland, will return to the UK for refurbishment. The cruiser HMS Cardiff has exceeded its 20-year service life and has recently been ordered to return home. It will leave Hong Kong this Saturday. The British Admiralty will send the newly built "Town Class" cruiser HMS Newcastle to replace the ship. HMS Suffolk, whose service life has expired, has recently set sail for the UK.</p>
<h3>Engineer Proposes to Hong Kong Government: To Build a Great Air Raid Tunnel; From Victoria Peak Directly to Aberdeen, 2,000 Feet; Estimated Budget of Over One Million Dollars; Can Accommodate 100,000 People in Wartime; Blackout Drill Next Mid-Month</h3>
<p>According to a report yesterday, the international situation is dangerous, and if war breaks out, air raids will be a terrible concern. To prepare for a rainy day, the Hong Kong authorities are stepping up air defense work. According to a proposal by an engineer, if a tunnel is dug on Victoria Peak, directly to Aberdeen, it can accommodate 100,000 people for shelter, with an estimated cost of approximately $1,166,300. According to his detailed plan, if the government agrees, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Can Be Used for Air Defense and Benefit Transportation</p>
<p>In the future, with this tunnel, it can not only be used for air defense in wartime, but also facilitate troops and benefit transportation in peacetime. Vehicles in the city can pass through this tunnel to Aberdeen in just five to ten minutes. Therefore, Aberdeen will be greatly developed as a residential area, solving part of the housing problem. The tunnel is approximately 12,000 feet long, 20 feet high, and 40 feet wide. The excavated soil can be used to fill the Connaught Road sea embankment, as the Hong Kong government is currently considering widening from the United Pier to the Naval Dockyard. The project is estimated to take ten months to complete. The cost of labor is approximately $193,500, the cost of equipment is approximately $193,000, and the cost of materials is approximately $779,800, totaling over one million dollars.</p>
<p>Blackout Drill in Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>The Hong Kong military authorities attach great importance to air defense matters. Blackout drills were conducted several times last year to ensure that Hong Kong residents are familiar with air defense knowledge and reduce the risk of air raids. The first blackout drill of this year will be held at the earliest possible time. It is reliably learned that the implementation of the drill this year can be realized in mid-next month. At that time, it is hoped that people everywhere will cooperate with the authorities. The blackout drill this time will be more or less serious than last year.</p>
<p>Population Evacuation to New Territories Mainland</p>
<p>Currently, the authorities believe that the population in the urban area of Hong Kong is too dense. To cope with emergencies, the population will be evacuated. The evacuation locations are planned to be in the New Territories mainland, Lantau Island, Lantau Island and other places. The authorities have also decided to train 100 volunteer air defense firefighters in the shortest possible time, with a four-month period for graduation. The age is from 25 to 45 years old, but only those who are physically strong and have no other bad habits can be selected.</p>
<h3>Within a Year: Fundraising Performance to be Held in Hong Kong; General Mobilization of Drama Actors Staying in Hong Kong to Participate</h3>

After arriving in Hong Kong, the playwright Xia Yan plans to personally call on the actors staying in Hong Kong to jointly perform once in Hong Kong. At 4:00 PM yesterday, he hosted famous directors and actors staying in Hong Kong at the Wins Hotel to discuss the performance. Those present included Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin, Cheng Bugao, Tang Jieqiu, Lin Shu, Su Yi, Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Huang Miaozi, Chen Shihui, and others, more than ten people. A performance committee was immediately established. In addition to connecting the feelings of the actors in Hong Kong, this performance in Hong Kong will also raise funds for cultural undertakings in China.</p>
<h3>American President Lines: Plans to Build Nine New President Liners; Three of Which Will Regularly Travel Between Hong Kong and the United States</h3>
<p>Since the restoration of American President Lines, it has gradually regained the position previously occupied by American liners. The highest authority of the company is the U.S. Maritime Commission. Yesterday, Senator McAdoo of the Commission stated in Washington that nine new President liners will be built to regularly travel between San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Little Luzon. Three of them will weigh 25,000 tons, approximately 3,000 tons heavier than the President Coolidge. The remaining six will weigh 15,000 tons each and will be used to travel on around-the-world routes. In the future, when the ships are completed, the strength of American merchant ships on the Pacific route will surpass that of merchant ships from other countries.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Grand Union of All Hong Kong Drama Groups: "Yellow Flower Mound" to be Performed; Fundraising for the Relief Federation to Comfort the Families of Soldiers Who Died in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>"Look—the pioneers of the nation on Yellow Flower Mound,</p>
<p>Ringing the blood bell of revolution with their lives;</p>
<p>The spring is bright and beautiful, the willows are swaying,</p>
<p>Who can bear to bid farewell to parents and wives!</p>
<p>Striving for national freedom and liberation,</p>
<p>Vowing to bury their bones on Yellow Flower Mound,</p>
<p>Yellow flowers bloom, yellow flowers fall,</p>
<p>These people are gone and will never return."</p>
<p>"May the 450 million compatriots rise up and follow the bloody path of struggle and sacrifice of our predecessors to defend China—Great China forever!"</p>
<p>The tragic song of mourning the yellow flowers, especially when singing "Who can bear to bid farewell to parents and wives," brought tears to my eyes uncontrollably. In order to create China, the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound finally "endured" and "bid farewell" to their parents and wives! In order to "follow the bloody path of the martyrs" to rebuild China, countless soldiers participating in the War of Resistance also finally "endured" and "bid farewell" to their parents and wives! Only we, who survive by stealing life and enjoy the fruits of their labor, only we, who have parents and wives, should feel ashamed! How ashamed!</p>
<p>In order to slightly reduce the unease in our hearts, in order to atone for our sins in the slightest, performing "Yellow Flower Mound" to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance is a very meaningful event.</p>
<p>The revolution of Yellow Flower Mound is the most tragic and greatest history of the Chinese nation; the completion of the "Yellow Flower Mound" script is the collective creation of progressive war playwrights and an unprecedented achievement in the drama world. In today's fierce War of Resistance, performing "Yellow Flower Mound" to praise the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness and raising funds to comfort the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance is to comfort the martyrs under the Nine Springs. This is indeed the inescapable task of those of us who steal life and die later. Therefore, the drama circles in Hong Kong and the Relief Federation of all circles in Hong Kong have all risen up to jointly perform this great revolutionary drama "Yellow Flower Mound," fulfilling an unprecedented effort and unity and writing a bright page in the history of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"Yellow Flower Mound" was originally scheduled to be performed on the Yellow Flower Festival. However, due to insufficient fundraising and careful arrangements, it was decided to perform at the Taiping Theater for three consecutive days starting on May 3rd. This can further symbolize the yellow flowers. And our remembrance and admiration for the martyrs will forever linger in our minds.</p>
<p>"Yellow Flower Mound," a great revolutionary historical drama in four acts and six scenes, requires 300 people to perform on and off stage. The vividness of the content is self-evident. The greatness and realism of the props and costumes go without saying. The drama groups participating in this performance include New Sound Drama Society, Red and White Drama Troupe, China Art Drama Troupe, Anti-War Drama Troupe, Whirlwind Drama Troupe, Ding Chou Drama Troupe, Youth League, China Travel Drama Troupe, Self-Strengthening Drama Troupe, Resilience Drama Troupe, Iron Flow Drama Troupe, Youth Recreation Club, Ant Drama Troupe, Vanguard Drama Troupe, Times Drama Troupe, Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and more than 40 drama groups.</p>
<p>The directors include Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi and other pioneers of the drama movement, who have been actively rehearsing at South China Middle School and China Art Drama Troupe for the past twenty days. The work is proceeding very tensely. The brave Lu Dun plays Huang Xing, the female actor Qu Ai plays Xu Zonghan. Jiang Ming plays a yamen runner who does not speak, focusing on the difference in emotions. More than a hundred other roles are all selected from the Hong Kong drama circle. It is expected that the performance will have a truly touching performance.</p>
<p>Recently, the Yellow Flower Mound Performance Special Committee of the Relief Federation has been actively preparing, and the work is already underway. (See the Hong Kong news of this newspaper). The problem now is that our overseas Chinese must remember.</p>
<p>The great revolutionary historical drama "Yellow Flower Mound" will be performed at the Taiping Theater for three consecutive days starting on May 3rd. In order to appreciate the most progressive theatrical art and receive the most revolutionary baptism, we must immediately recognize the sale of admission tickets to see "Yellow Flower Mound"! We must also sympathize with the 300 enthusiastic actors and the enthusiastic workers who are preparing for the performance, and help them promote the sale of admission tickets and encourage family and friends to watch "Yellow Flower Mound" together. Remember! Remember! Remember! The money raised from this charity performance will be used to raise funds for the Relief Federation to comfort the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance!</p>
<h3>Luo Xuhui Talks to Reporters: Government's Advice to Store Grain is Not True; Authorities Have Appropriate Measures for Food; Grain Storage News Was Talked About by a Westerner a Month Ago</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 26th, various newspapers in Hong Kong published that the Hong Kong authorities advised residents to store one month's worth of food in order to avoid being at a loss when an emergency occurs. After the news was published, all the people in Hong Kong were concerned, and Sir Luo Xuhui, the chief representative of the Chinese, was particularly concerned. The reporter made a special visit to Luo Xuhui at his office yesterday. Luo said that it has been rumored in Hong Kong recently that the Hong Kong authorities advised residents to store one month's worth of food, and the news has also been published in newspapers. After reading it, I felt very surprised. I had not heard of it beforehand, so I went to visit Mr. Kerry, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, to ask if he had heard of the news. According to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, he also said that he did not know. I then went to visit the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, and asked about this matter. According to Mr. Smith, the Hong Kong government did not order or advise residents to store grain. However, the news was first published by a Western newspaper. If you want to know the source, you must wait until you ask the Western newspaper to find out the truth. Until this morning (yesterday), the Colonial Secretary replied to me, saying that the news published by the Western newspaper was a conversation between the reporter of the newspaper and a Westerner two or three months ago about the food problem caused by the serious situation in Europe last September, and it also mentioned Singapore's food, and Singaporean newspapers had already published this problem. But this is only a local food relationship in Singapore, and it is not something that the Hong Kong government should show. As for the big food problem in Hong Kong, the government has already taken appropriate measures. Therefore, I dare to solemnly explain to the residents of Hong Kong that they can rest assured.</p>
<h3>Cholera Prevention Campaign: Hong Kong Government to Start on May 1st; Hopes Residents Will Cooperate in Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>As summer approaches, there is a possibility of cholera epidemics in Hong Kong. If prevention is not done in advance, the spread may be alarming. The Hong Kong government authorities will start a cholera prevention campaign on May 1st, in view of the fact that one case of the disease has been discovered in Hong Kong, which was transmitted from Macau. Moreover, after the war in South China, epidemics are more likely to occur. Last year, various hospitals and district health bureaus vigorously administered vaccinations, which were very effective. The residents were also afraid of the serious cholera epidemic and deaths in 1937, and they voluntarily injected vaccinations without the government's coercion. Therefore, although the population of Hong Kong increased last year, it was able to pass safely. The medical authorities hope that residents can maintain the spirit of cooperation from last year and prevent it in advance. In addition to injecting vaccinations, they must also pay attention to their daily life and diet.</p>
<h3>"Phoenix City," A Passionate Anti-Japanese War Drama　Gong Jiabao　… "China Travel" Charity Performance for the Women's Federation at the "Empress" Tonight…</h3>
<p>Writing a play is inherently more difficult than writing other things. Writing an anti-Japanese war drama is even more difficult than writing ordinary plays!</p>
<p>Therefore, when our national self-defense war unfolded on a vast scale, and comrades in theatrical work surged forward to shoulder the task of national salvation propaganda, a "script shortage" became a common phenomenon, a problem difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Women's Federation, in order to慰勞 front-line soldiers and generals, has decided to collaborate with the China Travel Drama Troupe for a charity performance tonight (28th) at 9 p.m. at the Empress Theatre. For this charity performance, "China Travel" is sacrificing all performance fees. The script chosen by both parties is Wu Zuguang's "Phoenix City." The entire story depicts national heroes Miao Kexiu, Zhao Dong, and others organizing the Young Iron-Blood Volunteer Army in the Northeast, putting up a strong resistance against the × people, until Kexiu dies a heroic death in Phoenix City. The Young Iron-Blood Army, under his encouragement, continues to fight the invaders. Interspersed are some interesting segments: Xia Wanbing—Kexiu's newlywed wife—transforming from a virtuous wife and loving mother into a strong warrior; Zhang Sheng—Kexiu's loyal aide—sacrificing himself gloriously to save his master after being wounded; Xia Chuan Jujian—a female spy of the × people—stealing the anti-× plan and being arrested; Jin Ying—a member of the Korean Revolutionary Party—sacrificing her body and marrying an ×× lieutenant general, waiting for an opportunity to assassinate him; and Little Feng, a girl who aspires to join the army...etc.</p>
<p>The best advantage of this script is that it is passionate, compact, and full of emotion, depicting the patriotic and tragic spirit of our compatriots participating in the self-defense war, with a "raging fire" momentum, making it easy for the actors to be moved by the lines, thus making the entire performance emotional, and therefore the audience is also easily moved!</p>
<p>The overall structure of the play is compact, the emotions are sincere, and the stage effects are also given considerable consideration. If one must nitpick, then it could be said that it is not written delicately enough, the so-called "squeezing the lemon juice without being able to squeeze it to the last drop." However, this little flaw, under the passionate emotions and majestic momentum of the entire script, can be said to be insignificant.</p>
<p>For the sake of national salvation propaganda, and for the sake of raising funds to慰勞 the front-line soldiers and generals, this script has a special significance in this place. I hope everyone will spend money to come to this worry to earn hot tears, to earn inspiration, and to earn the duties we should fulfill to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<h3>Two More Robberies Occurred on Land and Sea　Fifteen Thieves Armed and Robbed　A Whole Boat of Firewood on the South Toutou Sea Was Hijacked　Hundreds of Dollars Robbed from a He Surname Farmer in Sheung Shui</h3>
<p>The rampant state of banditry in Hong Kong is higher than it is today. Robberies occur on both land and sea every day, and residents are unable to defend themselves. Although the police detectives are rigorously pursuing the bandits, they ultimately do not know what the law is and act recklessly. Robberies are still frequent, especially in the New Territories. This morning, in a village in Sheung Shui, a farmer's residence was robbed by seven thieves, resulting in a loss of more than three hundred dollars. Also, on the 23rd of this month, in the South Toutou sea area near the British border, a cargo boat was hijacked by eight pirates who fired shots. The people on the boat were imprisoned in the cabin for two days. Later, near the cove, they were driven ashore, and the cargo boat was looted by the thieves, resulting in a loss of more than eight hundred dollars. The boat owner, Ou Wang, and his crewmate returned to Hong Kong yesterday and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. The details of the two robberies on land and sea are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Eight Pirates</p>
<p>Robbed a Cargo Boat</p>
<p>According to the report to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station by Ou Wang, the owner of the robbed cargo boat, number 632, he is a native of Taiping, Dongguan. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, he was commissioned by Chen Jinkui, the owner of a firewood shop in Xinwu Village, Nantou, Bao'an County, to transport 150 bundles of firewood to Hong Kong. When the boat was about to arrive at a certain sea area, suddenly two pirate boats flew over from the shore, each carrying four thieves, and ordered the boat to stop. We did not heed the order and continued to sail. The thieves, seeing that we did not obey the order to stop, fired several shots at our boat. Seeing this situation, we had to stop and lie down in the cabin to avoid the bullets. Before long, the two pirate boats drove and parked on either side of our boat. Six thieves carrying guns crossed over to our boat, threatening us and searching everyone's bodies, taking more than ten dollars in cash. Then they drove the four of us into the cabin, tightly closing the gun door. Since then, we have been in the cabin, not seeing the light of day, for two days. We also did not know where the thieves were driving our boat. On the morning of the 25th, the thieves released us and drove the five of us ashore. We then learned that the place was Chuanwan in China's territory. The thieves then drove our boat away. Since Chuanwan is not far from the British border, we walked back to Hong Kong. We only arrived yesterday morning. Our boat is worth three hundred dollars, and the firewood is worth five hundred dollars. We request an investigation and arrest, he said.</p>
<p>Seven Strong Thieves</p>
<p>Robbed a Farmer's Residence</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the residence of a Yan family in Sheung Shui Village, New Territories, which does not have a house number, the homeowner, surnamed He, named Bing, lives in the house with his family. At 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning, everyone had fallen into deep sleep. Suddenly, three thieves broke down the door and entered. He was awakened by the noise. Knowing that they were not good, He intended to wake up his family to resist the thieves. However, the thieves had already entered the house. The thieves immediately threatened He with a gun, telling him not to make any noise, otherwise they would be killed. Under these circumstances, He had to let them do as they pleased. Before long, four more thieves came in, for a total of seven thieves, all carrying long and short guns, with a fierce aura. After entering the house, the thieves subdued each member of the He family and then ransacked the house, turning it upside down. The thieves, finding little gain, were not satisfied and searched everyone's bodies, taking everything they could find. The whole process took about ten minutes. Finally, they fled towards the Chinese border with their stolen goods. The stolen items included 120 Hong Kong dollars in cash, 117 provincial dollars, as well as gold rings, gold earrings, gold watches, and expensive clothing, worth a total of $346.50. After the thieves had gone far away, He went to the police station to report the case, requesting a rigorous investigation to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice, he said.</p>
<h3>Tungsten Industry Develops　Miners in the New Territories　Large-Scale Mining</h3>

The tungsten mine in Shing Mun is progressing quite well, and can produce more than 100 loads of tungsten per month, it is said.</p>

<h3>Cutting Off Zengcong Road × Lost Contact　Our Army Takes Advantage of the Victory to Advance to Lapu　× Attacked from Left and Right, Retreating in Two Routes　Zengcheng × Trapped in a Large Encirclement by Our Army</h3>
<p>[Breaking News] The Zengcheng × army has been repeatedly attacked fiercely by our army and is exhausted from fighting. They are only desperately holding on to the county seat, Zhucun, Yongqiu Market, Fuhe, and other points, acting as mutual support. On one side, they drew a unit of about 3,000 men from Conghua, with eight cannons, and on the morning of the 25th, they launched a surprise attack on Paitan along the Zengcong Highway. When it was discovered by the Song unit of our ××× Division, they immediately met them head-on. After a fierce battle all day, our army bravely charged and fought, while one side launched a flanking attack from Pingcheng. At the same time, the Liang unit of our ××× Division, upon hearing the news, dispatched troops to reinforce Pingcheng and launched a pincer attack. × Was attacked from the left and right and collapsed. In this battle, more than 800 × were killed. × retreated to Gaohe and Lapu in two routes. On the 26th, our army took advantage of the victory and pursued, crossing Gaohe and cutting off the Zengcong Highway. They are now approaching Lapu and Gonghe, and × has lost contact and their morale has been shaken. There is a sign that they are preparing to withdraw to Liangtian and Fuhe Market. Our army continues to press on and will intercept the Fuchong Highway. Recently, the situation in Zengcheng is that × is in danger of falling into our large encirclement at any time.</p>
<h3>West River Front　Our Guerrillas Are Extremely Active　Sanshui × Increased Troops on Alert　Fengyong × Attempting to Defend to the Death</h3>
<p>[West River Breaking News] In the past ten days, there has been no major contact between our × and × on the Sanshui front. The Western Route counter-offensive troops received a telegraphic order from Commander-in-Chief Xia yesterday, adopting a mobile × control strategy, firmly establishing their positions, and waiting for an opportunity to strike, so the battle situation has been slightly quiet. However, the guerrillas are extremely active, constantly dispatching troops to attack the ×, making the × exhausted. The latest military intelligence is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Inspects　West River Front</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai, the newly appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sixteenth Army Group, arrived in Zhaoqing from Guizhou East the other day to take up his new position. He once summoned Deng Longguang, Commander of the Western Route Front, Chen Gongxia, Deputy Army Commander, Wang Dequan, Zhang Chi and others to hold a military meeting to discuss and instruct on all defense, × control, and counter-offensive plans. It is currently under investigation that in order to inspect the front-line defenses and review the fighting soldiers and local teams, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief has recently been accompanied by a large number of staff members on an inspection tour of Guangli, Yongan, and the front lines of Beishui and Mafang, summoning the commanders of various defense forces and the leaders of the self-defense teams, consulting and instructing on everything. It is reported that the inspection has now been completed and he has returned to a certain place to plan military affairs.</p>
<p>Sanshui × Army　Increased Troops on Alert</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, our army in the Western Route launched a counter-offensive against the × in Sanshui with a swift and decisive manner, crossing the river and capturing important strongholds one after another. The × entrenched in the Western Line, fearing being encircled and annihilated by us, concentrated in strongholds such as Hekou and Southwest in Sanshui, relying on their defenses and resisting stubbornly. In order to avoid going deep alone, our army closely surrounded and controlled the ×, and organized plainclothes guerrillas to launch a wide range of guerrilla warfare deep into the occupied areas. In recent days, they have repeatedly attacked the ×, gaining many victories. In order to respond to our guerrilla plan, the × commander in the West River, Zhongyuan, specially transferred a part of the × in Foshan to Hekou, Xipu and other places to strengthen security. From the 20th to the 24th, about 1,000 troops were deployed to the front line of Sanshui, distributed to guard the stations along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway.</p>
<p>Fengyong's ×　Building Defenses and Defending to the Death</p>
<p>Also, the × in Fengyong, a town on the Foshan-Shaoqing Highway north of Foshan, has been repeatedly attacked since our West River troops crossed the river to launch a counter-offensive. They are still being encircled and annihilated by our Li Division troops in coordination with the Tax Police Corps, so the × is greatly panicked. They have been constantly shelling Shengang and other places in recent days, and are rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs to resist our army's attack. On the 24th and 25th, a part of the × in Foshan, about four or five hundred people, reinforced the Fengyong garrison, capturing our strong young men and civilians along the way to help them transport barbed wire, wooden stones, sandbags, and military equipment and ammunition, with the intention of defending Fengyong to the death, it is said.</p>
<h3>Panyu Guerrillas　Two Successful Attacks　Seized a Batch of Firearms and Food</h3>
<p>[Panyu Breaking News] The Panyu guerrillas have been unusually active recently, launching fierce attacks on the × from time to time. On the 21st and 22nd of this month, they again ambushed and killed dozens of × soldiers at Fulian Mountain and Hekou Estuary, and sank multiple × boats. It is found that Fulian Mountain in the county is located on the west bank of the Pearl River, which is one of the transportation routes for the × people. Early in the morning of the 21st of this month, a × transport ship released six rubber boats and sailed along the Baihu Sea behind the mountain to unload and store firearms and grain. When three large wooden boats transported it back to the ship and returned to the river near the Wenmiao Temple on the mountain, they were discovered by the No. 5 Guerrilla Team lurking on the mountain. Unexpectedly, they fired machine guns at the × rubber boats from a high position. The × were caught by surprise and could not resist, so they had to abandon the towed wooden boats and fled in panic. The firearms and food on these boats all fell into our hands. The ×, unwilling to lose their supplies, dispatched more than 80 × soldiers on more than ten rubber boats the next day, patrolling the Baihu Sea multiple times and rotating into the Hekou Estuary in the north of the mountain, intending to land on the mountain to search. When they arrived at the end of the estuary, our guerrillas ambushed them again, using the embankment as cover for combat. Another unit, with the help of nearby boat people, took advantage of multiple speedboats to surround the rear of the ×. The × then collapsed. We sank three × rubber boats and killed more than 20 × soldiers, it is said.</p>
<h3>Various Places in Nanhai　Bandits Like Hair, Bandits Rob in Broad Daylight　Puppet Police Turn a Deaf Ear</h3>
<p>[Nanhai Breaking News] Since Nanhai fell, the local order has been extremely chaotic, and bandits have risen up. It has been even more rampant in the past ten days than before. The × army is unable to maintain order, and various places in Nanhai have almost become a bandit world. The most obvious are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guangzhou-Foshan Steamer Robbed</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month, the Dali steamer of the × Merchant Qianyi Company, traveling between Guangzhou and Foshan, set off from Foshan and arrived in the river off the Bian, when suddenly more than 20 bandits, divided into four long sampans, sailed towards the wheel head-on, firing shots at the wheel's helm house. One helmsman was shot dead on the spot. When they swarmed onto the wheel and reached the dining room, four puppet police officers resisted and three more were bombed to death. The remaining one was tied up in a corner by the bandits, who then began to plunder the passengers, for about an hour, before roaring away.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Rongzhou Zhaocun</p>
<p>Rongzhou is located south of Shishi. Although puppet police officers are stationed there after the Guangzhou × handover, their strength is weak and unable to maintain order. The Zhaocun there has always been prosperous, and the bandits have always coveted it. At 4:00 a.m. on the morning of the 20th of this month, a group of bandits, about a hundred people, robbed Zhao Village. When they arrived at the edge of the village, the villagers discovered them and immediately fired at the bandits. The bandits also returned fire. After a long time, the villagers were no match and were broken in by the bandits, who plundered property from house to house until dawn before leaving. Before leaving, in addition to kidnapping three men surnamed Zhao, they also set fire to more than ten houses in the village.</p>
<p>Robbing Pujun Market Pawnshop</p>
<p>At 11:00 a.m. on the 19th of this month, more than 20 bandits broke into the Yuanchang pawnshop on Tieyan Street in Pujun Market, detained the partners in a corner, and searched for valuables and 8,000 yuan in paper money. Then they entered the Delong Rice Shop next door and robbed it, seizing more than 4,000 yuan in paper money. The puppet police were in collusion with the bandits and turned a deaf ear. Later, the bandits calmly escaped to the suburbs of Datangyong.</p>
<h3>Guanghai × Boats　Commit Crimes at Haiyan, Failing and Drowning Completely　A Hull of an Empty Ship Moored at Leizhu Island</h3>
<p>(Taishan Breaking News) In order to contain our army's counter-offensive, the Jianghui × army sent out speedboats to harass the Single Water Estuary in Kaiping County on the 23rd. According to continued information from Taishan, the × warship moored near the Guanghai Shadi beach, which had been used for the ×'s offense at Shan Shui estuary, also sent seven search boats carrying 70-80 x soldiers to the Haiyan area of the 8th district in Taishan. They wanted to make a surprise attack. However, our guards noticed it and ambushed the coasts. When the × boats came near the fire line, they were greeted with a head-on hit. The × also put up with machine guns. The sides fought each other for an hour. Three x boats were sunk by our assistance. The remaining × soldiers began to save each other. The sunken x soldiers have all drowned. Seeing the sinking x soldiers, the × warship nearby fired back at the costs, covering other × boats to flee. Twelve x ships of school rank, and air-craft-carrier arrived the shore near and around. But only a hull moors the island of Leizhu, near to. Further, four battle destroyers patrol the beach and surround it, but no further attacks. The defense line is still quiet.</p>
<h3>After the Battle of Chaoshan, Changes Occurred in the Transportation of the Eastern Route. Waterways Will Be Centered on Meixian. Travel and Freight Can Still Maintain Normalcy</h3>
<p>[Chaoan Breaking News] The coastal area of Chaoshan is vulnerable to threats during wartime. The Yuezhong × has been counter-attacked by us recently, and is surrounded by enemies on all sides. However, it is still rumored that it will invade Shantou on the 29th of this month. The local military and civilian administrative officials have long been prepared. In addition to deploying military forces, manpower, and material resources in various coastal areas, they have also carried out the destruction of roads early on. The Eastern Provincial Highway is the most recent transportation route. The trunk road starts from Chaoan to Qujiang, passing through Jieyang, Fengshun, Xingning, Wuhua, Longchuan, Heyuan, Lianping, and Wengyuan. It is a total of 186 kilometers. At the beginning of this month, in order to meet the needs of wartime, the Chaoan-Jieyang section was destroyed for the first time, leaving only small paths for highway vehicles to travel temporarily. Now it has been decided to destroy it thoroughly, and continue the destruction work from Jieyang to the Monkey Ridge area of Fengshun. The Eastern Road traffic will only reach Fengshun. In the future, traffic between the provincial capital and the eastern regions will change accordingly. Fortunately, the impact is still small. Those entering the inland from the coast still have to change to waterways, taking a steamer from Chaoan to Songkou, and then transfer to a boat to Meixian, where there is a highway leading to Xingning. This route has been used for a long time. In Xingning, they still follow the highway to enter the inland. From then on, the Eastern Road traffic will take Meixian as its hub, and the travel of passengers and the transportation of goods can maintain normalcy.</p>
<h3>Three × Warships　Suddenly Sailed into Daya Bay　Patrolling Without Leaving, Coastal Tension　Planes Reconnoiter Huizhang Highway</h3>
<p>[Boluo Breaking News] According to a report from the local military agency, (1) On the 25th, three × giant warships suddenly sailed into the waters of Daya Bay, with unclear intentions. As of yesterday, the 26th, the three warships had not sailed elsewhere and were patrolling from time to time, their movements were suspicious, and the situation along the coast was tense. We have been closely monitoring them. (2) On the same day, a × plane flew from the west to the sky above Boluo, circling several times, and then flew to Huiyang, passing over Jiazipu and patrolling along Huizhang Road for a long time before flying away without dropping bombs.</p>
<h3>Along the Minxi and Southern Jiangxi Line</h3>
<p>— Mo Feng Lan</p>
<p>The spring water of Poyang Lake has risen sharply, and the main force of the × army is gradually gathering along the Xiu River. The defense of northern Jiangxi is at the urgent moment before the storm. In order to understand the various wartime rear dynamics of southern Jiangxi, the reporter decided to take advantage of the eve of the war. After days of spring rain, he took western Changting as the starting point and made a journey in the flames of war to southern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>The car departed at 8:30 am on March 22nd. The long-distance bus, weathered and worn, was like a clumsy ox, constantly panting and stalling. Every time it was filled with fuel and water, it could not run a few miles before it had to stop. Although the weather was clear, the accumulated mud and water from many days was still radioactive. When the car flew over the mud, the mud splashed like raindrops on both sides, wetting the outer clothes of every passenger. Passengers who knew how to protect themselves mostly lowered their heads, no longer in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery outside the carriage.</p>
<p>The treacherous and narrow mountain roads between Ting and Rui, Sanjiannao, and Jiuhei, took almost two hours. The driver, loyal to his duty, measured the road and feared accidents, repeatedly advised passengers to wade through a short section of muddy slope to reduce the weight of the car. After the car went down Jiuli Ridge, a plain unfolded in front. A few minutes later, it arrived at the large market town on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi—Gucheng. Gucheng is a town with 5,000 people under the jurisdiction of Changting County. The paper industry is quite developed, and the self-defense force is also strong. Watchtowers stand facing each other in the town, and they have repeatedly used force to repel the covetousness of nearby bandits.</p>
<p>Upon entering Jiangxi, there is a characteristic: cruciferous green manure is planted all over the mountains and fields. The flowers of the green manure are white, occasionally mixed with purple and green, not very obvious. A vast expanse of white flowers looks like a sheet of snow. The fields and frogs are all over the highway. According to Director Jiang of the Changting County Nursery on the same car, the seeds of green manure are planted in early spring. In early February, they are plowed and mixed into the soil to increase the organic fertilizer in the soil. Its function is slightly similar to the ordinary fertilizers used in Fujian Province. Several counties bordering Fujian Province and Jiangxi, such as Changting and Ninghua, have already begun to try it. The geographical areas of western Fujian and northern Jiangxi are both spurs of the Wuyi Mountains. The climate and rainfall are roughly similar. There should be no difficulty in trying green manure. Mr. Jiang also mentioned the task of this trip, which is to purchase high-quality yellow cattle, various fruit tree seedlings, and fish species from Ruijin to improve Changting's agriculture. Northern Jiangxi has now become a war zone, and the agricultural products of southern Jiangxi will be entirely supplied to the front line, and can no longer be of any benefit to western Fujian. In response to this possibility, Fujian, which is mountainous and barren, is promoting winter cultivation and the planting of upland rice, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in the province. This kind of far-sighted planning shows the Fujian provincial authorities' determination and preparation for future changes everywhere.</p>
<p>The Ting-Rui Highway is a small section of the Fujian-Hunan line. Bridge foundations under construction can be seen everywhere along the way, and the road surface is also being paved and tidied up. The road workers are very busy. About four kilometers from Ruijin, the highway crosses the Mian River. A section of the bridge was destroyed by the flood. The brave driver drove at the highest speed and rushed to the other side through the water. The waves splashed everywhere, forming a spectacular sight. When the car arrived on the other side, the passengers, who had just recovered from the shock, could not help but get out of the car to see what was happening. The passengers revisited their shock at the rapid flow and broken bridge. Next to the broken bridge, there is a new-style bridge being built by more than fifty workers. Its majestic and beautiful appearance symbolizes the potential and greatness of the Chinese nation. Everyone looked at each other and smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>The car arrived at Ruijin Station at 1:20 pm. Forty-two miles took more than five hours. Muddy roads and broken cars really delay time. As soon as the reporter got off the car, another group of passengers rushed up, wanting to take the same car to Changting. Noteworthy among the passengers were two wounded soldiers wearing red honor badges. One with an injured left hand supported his sick companion with his right hand, limping towards the carriage. If the reporter had not witnessed it, he would not have imagined that the people in the rear would be so loving and caring for the wounded soldiers. Everyone helped the sick wounded soldier into the car, found an empty space for him to lie down, and gave up another seat for the wounded soldier with the left hand injury to sit. He refused, but the people refused even more, forcibly pushing him to sit down. The reporter was so moved by this great scene of military-civilian cooperation that he almost shed tears. With tears in his eyes, he jumped back into the carriage, took out a small packet of Yunnan Baiyao from his bag, found a bowl of boiled water, and taught him to take it. Talking to them, he learned that they were new soldiers of the 6th Division of the New Fourth Army. After the Battle of De'an, they were transferred to the ×× Division and fought on the Xiu River front. This time they were unfortunately injured and were lying in a rear hospital for treatment. Not long ago, the commander-in-chief of the war zone received a letter of honor, military pay, and taught them to return to their hometowns. Now, one is going back to Ninghua, and the other is also going back to Tai'ning. They are extremely concerned about the front, and asked about the front line extremely eagerly. When the reporter told them that northern Jiangxi was in an emergency and that × troops had been discovered near Wucheng Town, they all looked north with extreme depression, as if regretting this injury, and losing a great opportunity to kill ×.</p>
<p>Ruijin is surrounded by mountains and water, with fish ponds scattered like stars, quite like the scenery of Jiangnan. Since the civil war, the population of more than 300,000 has been reduced to only 191,500. Many mansions have become rubble fields. Various slogans are written all over the streets and walls. These are the historical relics. If you want to see more buildings of historical significance, there is a Yuting Park eight miles outside the city, where there are memorial towers and monuments built by soldiers of the 10th Column in memory of the fallen soldiers. Fifteen miles east of the city, there are also the execution ground and the Red Army Martyrs' Memorial Tower, quietly lying there.</p>
<p>Ruijin was formerly Xianghu Town under the jurisdiction of Ganzhou. It was not until the middle of the Southern Tang Dynasty that the county was established. The Mian River and Tanxi River flow through it. The rice, beans, tobacco, timber, Chinese yams, and paper produced there were worth more than two million yuan each year before the war, but now it is only more than seven hundred thousand yuan. After the Anti-Japanese War, the economic relationship with western Fujian is even more closely linked. Ruijin's products rely on the Ting River for transportation, and the food that Ruijin needs most must also be transported by Changting. Western Fujian and southern Jiangxi are not only in the same geographical area, but also have an inseparable economic relationship.</p>
<p>Ruijin is richly endowed by nature, but the political institutions are still disappointing. The county administration is not as sound as that of Fujian. The organization among counties, districts, and baojia is extremely lax. The meager quota of 121 conscripted soldiers per month is scraped together from east and west. People are even learning the old methods of avoiding chaos and going into the mountains to avoid conscription. It can be seen that propaganda and conscription methods cannot be perfected (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Happy Angel (13)</h3>
<p>"Harry!" someone shouted outside, "Come quickly!"</p>
<p>"Coming!" he answered unconsciously.</p>
<p>When Harry came back, she was sitting in front of the piano playing the tune of "One Night of Joy." The twilight made the room dim, but he could still see the tears glistening on her eyelashes. When she discovered that Harry was with her in this empty house, she didn't seem surprised.</p>
<p>"What trouble are you having?"</p>
<p>"None." He casually picked up a bottle of opened champagne from a table. "Whose is this?"</p>
<p>"Mine. Would you like some?"</p>
<p>"Thank you." He poured himself a glass and drank it.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Have you crossed the boundary?"</p>
<p>"The girls have all gone over. Mr. Quenais has promised to take care of them."</p>
<p>"So, you've come back to me?" Her voice was soft and mysterious.</p>
<p>"Obviously."</p>
<p>Irene looked at him and suddenly asked, her eyes moist with tears, "In that happy, musical soul of yours, there is a spirit of chivalry. You risk your life and run here to help and comfort a woman in distress. Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is the plain and simple truth."</p>
<p>Opening her handbag, she took out something. "Look," she said softly, "A souvenir from Omar Black."</p>
<p>Harry looked at it and felt his eyelids twitch.</p>
<p>"Do you remember…?" Irene asked softly. "I told you that I'm not just anyone. That's true. I'm not just anyone. I know that one doesn't need to tell others the truth. I thought that if I could tell a huge lie, I could make myself great. But I can't lie to you, because you are different from all the others. You are an honest man."</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Harry held her tightly in his arms. They kissed.</p>
<p>"I'll try to get a passport. We can cross the border tomorrow morning. We can find those six girls and work together. We can work together."</p>
<p>Irene's eyes were shining. She said without disguise, "I will become a great person." At this moment, there was a huge crashing sound outside, and someone rushed into the house.</p>
<p>"Bomb!" the man shouted. "Let's get to the cellar quickly!"</p>
<p>"Ah, no," Irene said, "We must stay here and admire this magnificent spectacle."</p>
<p>"Madam, I advise you not to be so careless. Life is not a child's play," the man said.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, death and I are old friends."</p>
<p>"Turn off the lights, extinguish all the lights!" someone shouted outside again. "Everyone go to the cellar!"</p>
<p>"Do you want to go to the kiln?" Irene asked Harry.</p>
<p>"Do you want to?"</p>

<h3>Single Championship of the Lawn Tennis Tournament - Xu Brothers in Charge. Younger Xu Defeated Li Huitang Yesterday. Semifinal of Doubles Today</h3>
<p>...The All Hong Kong Open Tennis Singles Semifinal was held at 5 pm yesterday. Xu Jiasheng vs. Li Huitang. Xu Jiasheng did not play strongly, often having "double faults" in his serves. His strength was also not as good as before, deviating from his standard. Yesterday, he struggled, showing his shortcomings and rarely highlighting his strengths. Unless he practices hard, his future is not optimistic. Li Huitang, on the other hand, although his serves were strong, had the disadvantage of "double faults", totaling five times throughout the match, the same as Xu. Li's net play was not of a high standard, with frequent mistakes. Even when he encountered Xu at the net, he was helpless. This is the reason for Li's defeat.</p>
<p>...Yesterday's three-set battle spent eight-tenths of its time in dinking the ball, with nothing exciting. It was like chewing wax. In the first set, both sides fought with the spirit of calmness and step-by-step operation, resulting in scores of 2-2, 3-3, and 4-4, tied three times. Xu's net play was skilled, and he finally won the first set with a score of 6-4. In the second set, Xu took advantage of Huitang's mistakes to take the lead all the way, from 3-2, 4-2, to 6-2. Xu's performance in this set was better than the first set, with fewer mistakes and stable drop shots. In contrast, the balls hit by Huitang either hit the net or went out of bounds, losing a lot of valuable points, hence the defeat.</p>
<p>In the third set, both sides adopted the strategy of defensive shots. The ball soared above the scale of 10 feet. Xu's net play was clumsy, and Huitang tried his best to meet the attack. The ball went back and forth, but it had enough "toughness but lacked sharpness." Hui once threatened Xu with a lead of 5-3. Everyone thought that this set must be won by Huitang. But Xu bravely chased after him, tying the score at 5-5. Afterwards, when Huitang served, Huitang won, and when Xu served, Xu won. They fought to five ties, making it 10-10, and continued to struggle. Xu, in the calmness, finally won the victory with 12-10 and obtained the right to the final, creating a situation where the brothers monopolize the singles championship.</p>
<p>There is a doubles semi-final today, with the Lin brothers against Li Rurong and He Jialiu, which is sure to be worth watching. The latest situation of the singles is listed below.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Meitong Public School Physical Education Department Launches Women's Amusement Day Movement - Eliminating Championship Doctrinism Intense Sports - Inviting Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' Schools to Participate</h3>
<p>(Shanghai News) Recently, the American sports community has deeply felt that various championship doctrinism's intense sports are harmful to women's health. Due to the different physical organization of men and women, they advocate social and recreational sports. Therefore, "Amusement Day" (Play Day) has emerged. The activity is held on a sunny day, gathering female students from various schools in one field to hold various performances, games, ball games, etc., with the aim of cultivating body and mind, and connecting feelings. Victory or defeat is irrelevant to the overall situation, eliminating the psychological tension of taking winning as the sole goal. It is truly an activity worth promoting. The Meitong Public School in this city has also taken notice of this and will invite Chinese and Western girls' schools in Shanghai to hold the first "Amusement Day" in Shanghai at the school on May 27th. Invitation senders are: Western schools include the British, Western Girls', Northern Western Girls', Sacred Heart, Le Li, etc.; Chinese schools include Chinese and Western, Industrial Girls' High, Chongde, Qixiu, Qingxin, and Deer, etc. It is expected that it will be a sensation at that time.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bicycle Race: Seven Elderly Men Display Skill, Xu Ruifen and Kuai Shitai Win Men's and Women's Championships</h3>
<p>(Shanghai News on the 24th) The third Bicycle Race Meeting, organized by the Shanghai Cycling Association, was held in Jiaozhou Park at 9:00 am yesterday. There were over 600 spectators, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. The results of the competition were as follows: Xu Zhengzhi Shield one-mile champion for men was Kuai Shitai, with a time of two minutes, fifty-six and eight-tenths seconds; Xu Zhengzhi Shield one-mile championship for women was Xu Ruifen, with a time of three minutes, forty-six and eight-tenths seconds. Xu Zhengzhi Elementary Men's and Women's one-mile handicap race: the first place for boys was Ge Er, and the first place for girls was Wang Zumei. The last event was the half-mile handicap race for seniors, which was extremely exciting. As a result, Shi Geshi reached the finish line first with a time of one minute, forty-eight and four-tenths seconds, winning the Mike Nuodui Cup. It is said that Mr. Bie had won championships in England before, and his skills as a veteran are extraordinary. The second place was Guo Baoshu, the eldest son of Guo Biao, the former manager of Shui'an Company. The third place was Bai Sai, the director of the Donations Department of the Public Concession.

<p>Swimming Guide</p>
<h3>Diving</h3>
<p>Now let's talk about diving.</p>
<p>If you are practicing swimming and neglecting the breathing movements, then breathing is the most important part of diving. If the amount of breathing is small, it will not be easy to dive for more than five minutes. In the water, the body has to withstand great pressure, which is extremely difficult. For beginners, the distance between the body in the water and the surface of the water should be as short as possible. Since you have reached the stage of learning to dive, it is easy to do that. On the other hand, in order to make the body accustomed to water pressure and increase resistance, you should often go to deep water. At this time, the eardrums will sting, the chest will feel heavy pressure, the head will be dizzy, and the whole body will feel uneasy. If you get used to it for a long time, you will be more receptive and obviously make more progress.</p>
<p>Many timid people feel very uncomfortable in deep water, which is also a disadvantage that hinders practice. However, it is worth considering whether the diving environment is safe. In the swimming pool, the area in front of the diving platform is a dangerous place, and the side of the pool is also a good place to enter the water. If you are not careful, you may harm each other, which is unimaginable. There are even more dangers in rivers and seas. Boats and floating objects on the sea surface all threaten the safety of divers. It is very uneasy for beginners to keep their eyes open while diving. Most people close their eyes because of this, which makes it easy to suffer losses. If the sun is shining on the surface of the water, divers do not feel dark in the water. In principle, it is best to keep your eyes open. However, if the water is dark and you do not know the actual situation, be careful not to get your head bumped or injured. It is better to dive in slowly.</p>
<p>The breaststroke movement is the most suitable for diving. How about changing directions up, down, left, and right? (1) Changing directions up and down: The body's forward force is generated by the action of the limbs resisting the water. If you want to dive down, your palms must push upwards. The so-called upward push is not just pushing the palms towards the surface of the water, but also having the palms face upwards in all the movements, so that the head can descend. This is a great help for diving down. The hands that rise should press down towards the bottom of the water, and of course, the head should move upwards in coordination. (2) Changing directions left and right: If you want to turn left, increase the force of your hands pushing the water to the right, and reduce the force of your right hand, which will act as a rudder to change direction. If you want to turn right, you can use the same principle.</p>
<p>Because the whole body is in the water, the resistance to forward movement is greater than in other swimming styles. Strive to keep the limbs from tilting and make the movements of bending and contracting the limbs as quickly as possible. This is a way to reduce wasted effort. To achieve this goal, you must first have a correct and excellent breaststroke posture. Otherwise, it will not be easy to make progress in diving in water that is difficult to see and has more difficulties.</p>
<p>If diving is applied, it will not be very useful if you only have this skill. Therefore, you must increase the distance you can dive. The length of the distance can be determined by time and energy. The diving action is correct and appropriate, which is also relevant. Being able to dive for a considerable amount of time and distance will be more helpful for self-defense and application. This requires hard work and practice according to the correct methods.

<h3>Discussion on the Settlement of Accounts for Factories in War Zones</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>"Thousands of homes are wailing in the scorched earth, and where can the people return?" In this crucible of the War of Resistance, the prosperity of industrial and commercial enterprises has been destroyed in the flames and lost. In particular, the silk, yarn, and flour mills of the people's light industry have suffered the greatest sacrifices, either destroyed by fire or occupied. Some machines were seized, and some goods were looted. "No egg is left intact under a toppled nest," let alone the national enterprises that are the lifeline of the economy. I have been an accountant in a yarn factory for more than ten years. Now, because the location of my work, Pudong, is blockaded and occupied, the production machines of the enterprise cannot operate, and my family life is under severe pressure. I am also trapped in the depression of semi-unemployment. Thinking of the large number of unemployed workers, the large chimneys are no longer smoking, and even the thousands of small chimneys are no longer cooking. Who is responsible for all of this? In this unprecedented catastrophe in history, the enterprise authorities have suffered great pain. After the pain subsides, however, if there is a glimmer of hope for the recovery of the enterprise, they should continue to work hard and strive to sow the seeds for the future of the enterprise and struggle out of the darkness. As Mr. Xi Yushu said, "The stability of society depends on the vitality of enterprises. If vitality cannot be maintained and is allowed to die, the chaos of society will be unimaginable. Therefore, those who can continue to conduct business should try to preserve it as the best policy..." This is indeed a wise saying—(See Mr. Xi Yushu's article "Handling of Wartime Losses When Handling Settlement of Accounts for Industry and Commerce" in the previous newspaper).</p>
<p>I would like to discuss the issue of settlement of accounts from an accounting perspective, based on the second item suggested by Mr. Xi: "Assets" are damaged, part of the capital is depreciated, and business cannot be conducted temporarily because (1) transportation is blocked and raw materials cannot be purchased, (2) the war zone is not open and machines cannot be used, and (3) the market is depressed, even if there are loans, there is no market for sales, and business can still be done when order is restored..." This is indeed the case.</p>
<p>(A) Before it is actually possible to clearly understand the extent of the damage to houses, machines, equipment, and goods, etc. in the war zone, the accounting settlement for the current year should still list new subjects, debiting "War Zone Houses," "War Zone Machines," "War Zone Goods," etc. to distinguish them.</p>
<p>(B) If the figures for the damage and the actual losses are clearly investigated, a "Wartime Damage Fee" account should be listed as a "Deferred Asset" to be amortized annually after the resumption of business.</p>
<p>(C) If the war zone assets have been insured against war risks, but have not yet received compensation, the "Wartime Assets Insured Against War Risks" should be debited and the "Wartime Asset War Risk Reserve" should be credited. After receiving full compensation, or only receiving partial compensation, the amount of compensation should be deducted from the "Wartime Property Loss Fee" account and then included in the "Deferred Assets" to be amortized from the annual profits.</p>
<p>(D) Wartime special expenses are maintained (such as expenses for retaining some employees, and guards for factories) or paid from government bonds, or from borrowing for operation. The war has been prolonged to one year and four months—this wartime special expense is considerable. I think it can be included in the new account "Wartime Special Expenses" and also treated as a "Deferred Asset" to be amortized annually in the future.</p>
<p>(E) "Accounts Payable" should be planned in advance for phased payment after the resumption of business and listed in the "Wartime Accounts Payable" account. "Accounts Receivable" that cannot be recovered can be listed in the "Wartime Bad Debts" account. The various assets "Depreciation Reserves" from previous years' settlements should still be listed and included in the "Asset Loss Fee" according to the book value, and gradually eliminated after the resumption of business. I wonder if this is reasonable.</p>

<h3>Thinking of Air Raid Alarms</h3>
<p>— Jianbin</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been practicing air raid alarms one after another. The strange sound reminds people of Guangzhou, which has fallen. There were also air raid alarms there. Not only during the day, but also many times every day. The feeling of the citizens has shown a numb state. Even at that time, I was still rolling around in bed every morning. The first alarm wailed, and then the emergency alarm rang, the shaking sound, rising and falling, seemed to be foretelling that the Japanese invaders were about to start work. As usual, I hurriedly rolled out of bed, rushed to the rooftop, and watched the air and ground artillery battles with sleepy eyes. At this time, the entire city was bathed in the light of the morning sun, and the hope of all citizens was pinned on the anti-aircraft artillery team. Such experience did not last long, and then Greater Guangzhou fell, and Zengcheng was lost and fell. When the alarm could still sound, the local authorities on high had not properly prepared how to defend this birthplace of revolution, how to strike the strikers with strikes, just like John Bull today, who is sounding air raid alarms in his colony on the one hand, and unwilling to form an iron line of peace in Europe on the other, to thoroughly strike fascism.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou, after the emergency alarm sounded, the anti-aircraft artillery battle rumbled! With the sound reverberating through the sky, the lights went out, the radio stopped working, and the tap water could no longer be turned on. Industry entered a semi-suspended state. The residents of Guangzhou had long experienced this. Hong Kong, this paradise without the smell of gunpowder, finally sounded the alarm for the first time today. I think the shameless and lewd people should be vigilant, right? The terrible experience, I don't know which day it will fall on them. The few wails of the alarm are to warn these people who have forgotten their motherland that the motherland needs them, and that they should not continue to live in a drunken dream.</p>
<p>Today, the responsibility of sounding the alarm in the country has been shouldered by the invaders. When our divine eagles fly over the skies of Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai, wasn't the Japanese army's alarm sounding sadly everywhere? Gorky translated by Fan Xun</p>
<h3>When Lonely</h3>
<p>— Gorky, translated by Fan Xun</p>
<p>Last night, when I was passing through the Torokou Bridge, I saw a young woman standing silently. This petite woman hooked her arm, wearing brown gloves, on the railing of the bridge. I watched for a while, thinking she was going to jump into the Neva River. But she just stuck out her clever tongue and posed maliciously at the moon in space.</p>
<p>The moon was like a cunning old fox, slipping lightly between the smoky clouds. It was round and big, like a drunken face of a drunkard. Maybe this woman had eaten its loss. Her actions were retaliatory. At least as I saw it, his pose towards the moon was very cold.</p>
<p>After seeing this interesting thing, I remembered other similar small things, which made me laugh out loud in my memory. As I see it, when a person is lonely and alone—at least he thinks there is no one else beside him—his behavior is like that of a mentally ill madman. I can't think of any other word to call these people who make strange movements.</p>
<p>The first time I saw someone's abnormal behavior when living alone was in my childhood. After a certain circus show ended, I saw the English fool Lang Er, who played the clown, walking along a corridor with no one in it. When he walked past a large mirror, he suddenly took off the tall hat on his head and respectfully bowed to his own shadow. There was indeed no third person here, but I was sitting in a water trough right above his head. He wouldn't have discovered me, but I could see his legs clearly. When he bowed at the waist to himself, I even stuck my head out to look at him. On this day, I pondered silently, feeling confused and unable to explain. But now I think about it, Langdai was just a clown, a person who made strange movements for a living, at most just a British instrument.</p>
<p>Many years later, one day, I went to visit Anjiaotu Chafujun, and someone told me that he was in the garden. When I walked into the garden gate, I saw him sitting there alone, trying to catch the sunlight with his hat and put it on his head. Of course, his wishful thinking would not succeed. I could see how annoyed he was by his repeated failures. His face became redder and redder. He quickly hit his knees with the hat, hurriedly put it on his head again, and finally, uninterested in this possible game, he kicked away the puppy beside him and cast a final glance at the sky with half-closed eyes, and walked lightly back to his own house. He saw me at the door, and he smiled and said to me, "Have you read Bai Mengte Xie's poems about rhythm? Oh! The sun is smiling at the grass! What a stupid guy, isn't it? In Russia, it laughs at the soap bubbles of Kachin (washerwoman), and here it laughs at the sweat of Geda Tan (grass)."</p>
<p>Another time I spied on him trying to stuff a thick red pencil into a narrow medicine bottle, of course to no avail. He probably knew he was conducting a great experiment to break a physical law, and he used the perseverance and patience of a scholar to do this ridiculous trick.</p>
<p>Lottoerstay spoke softly to a stone dragon: "Um—are you happy?" This little animal was lying on a stone in the shrubbery, sunning itself. Tolstoy stood quietly in front of it, still in his old style, with his hands inserted in the pockets of his wide coat. Finally, this great writer looked around cautiously, and finally sighed and said firmly: "If I were like you, I would not find happiness."</p>
<p>The great chemist Tie Xu Wensi Ji was sitting in his own dining room, holding a shallow teacup in his hand, reflecting his own shadow. He shouted loudly to the teacup: "Hey! Old fellow, what are you doing alone?" But the shadow coldly did not respond to him. Tie Xu Wensi Ji sighed for a long time, and his face gradually darkened. He frowned at his own image, twitching his nose, looking like an old elephant's wrinkled forehead and long nose.</p>
<p>The famous novelist Li Skowen sat alone at the table, tearing the cotton into small pieces and throwing them into the bowl one by one. Each time this small and soft cotton touched the bottom of the bowl, he pricked up his ears to listen to whether the cotton would make a sound in the bowl.</p>
<p>Voltrudis Ji Mus put a shoe in front of him and sternly ordered himself to walk. "I know you won't walk." He said smugly and proudly: "Look—without me, you can't get to where you want to go."</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Dad!" I broke in unexpectedly. He looked at me and said in self-deprecation: "You ask me about the shoes! These shoes are so small that they only wear to my heels. Now they always make these bad shoes."</p>
<p>When women are alone decorating or joking, they often talk to themselves. Once I saw a beautiful and well-educated woman sitting alone in an armchair by the window eating candy. Each time she lifted the food in her heart with delicate candy tongs, she murmured, "Now I'm going to eat you—" When she finished eating, she said to herself, "Wasn't I the one who ate you?"</p>
<p>There was only a beautiful young black woman in the lounge of a certain theater. She stopped in front of every mirror for a while. Suddenly, I heard her say: "However—a person always has to die."</p>
<p>There was no one else here except her and me. I was also too late and didn't get into the venue. But I was really too late and didn't see the first half of the strange drama she was performing. The room was dark, and she never thought there was anyone else in the room besides her. I think she wouldn't have asked a stranger such an unconventional question if she saw me. I don't think she ever knew that I was exploring such a profound philosophy.</p>
<h3>From the New Enlightenment Movement to Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>— Tongfang</p>
<p>The New Enlightenment Movement is currently the most urgent cultural and intellectual movement that needs to be promoted. China's war of resistance has developed to the present stage, and we undoubtedly need a strong national consciousness to complete the salvaging of the nation. Although culture and thought belong to the realm of ideology, they are an indispensable driving force for social development. The reason we can today form such a strong and firm national united front and launch such a great war of resistance is entirely due to the nationwide unity, the common belief in resisting aggression and insulting the nation, and thinking. Although any thought originates from practice, in order to achieve effective practice, various thoughts should be carefully discussed and criticized to make them consistent with practice. After the thoughts of the people across the country naturally converge, a unified opinion can be fully expressed, and human and material resources can be fully utilized. Therefore, in the current China, based on the requirements of practical development, it is necessary to widely promote the New Enlightenment Movement in thought and culture, unify opinions from all sides, and establish a solid ideological front to defeat various incomplete thoughts during the war of resistance and sweep away various traditional fallacies and theories. This is of the utmost urgency.</p>
<p>From this point, we must pay attention to the national spiritual mobilization that Chairman Chiang has shown us. At present, as the war of resistance enters the second stage and the enemy is in a dilemma, the introduction of the spiritual mobilization program can not only strengthen our spiritual consciousness and implement our determination to resist aggression and defend the nation, thereby laying the foundation for a unified national thought, but also indicate the common goals of Chinese thought at the current stage, serving as an important preparation for building a new China in the future. I think this is exactly the same as the New Enlightenment Movement, both being movements necessary to promote national spiritual arming.</p>
<p>The spiritual mobilization program stipulates the tasks that Chinese citizens should fulfill today. It requires us to regard the nation-state as paramount, concentrate our thoughts and will, and strive for survival. It also proposes that the ultimate goal of the war of resistance is to establish an independent, free, equal, and people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed Three Principles of the People republic. It also aims to eliminate selfish and self-interested feudal ideas and establish a new outlook on life necessary during the war of resistance. It can be said to be the backbone of spiritual mobilization. Just from the aspects of transforming national spirit, eliminating traditional bad habits, actively enriching, and concentrating national will, it is already known that spiritual mobilization not only provides the path that China's future ideological movement should take, but also is a higher stage of development for national unity against foreign aggression. From the union of various parties, factions, and stages, it proceeds to the unification of thought and the concentration of spirit. Therefore, all traitorous thoughts that shake the war of resistance, undermine national unity, and harm national interests should be completely eliminated so that the ideal of democratic politics can be realized.</p>
<p>However, in order to achieve the various common goals of spiritual mobilization, we must still strive to promote the mass literacy movement, that is to say, we cannot ignore the development of the New Enlightenment Movement in thought to complete the final task of resisting aggression and building the nation.</p>
<p>In the process of the second phase of the war of resistance, we should focus on military development, but mobilizing the thoughts of the entire nation cannot be ignored. Therefore, we urgently need to sweep away all traditional thoughts that are unfavorable to the war of resistance and promote the spiritual foundation for building a new China. If we acknowledge the importance of the New Enlightenment Movement to resisting aggression and building the nation, then we should accept the spiritual mobilization program to form a broad ideological front as the main basis for practice! In short,</p>
<h3>Digging Trenches</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhi</p>
<p>Now our guerrillas have become a mighty force, and the × army feels uneasy day and night. News of attacks on ×× constantly pours into the × people's camp. They are all terrified and can only dig trenches and build high walls to strengthen their defense. Therefore, the need to dig trenches is now extremely urgent.</p>
<p>Digging trenches requires a large amount of manpower. They go to the countryside and forcibly conscript laborers everywhere. When they arrive at a house, they see a man, whether old or strong, and tie them up one by one with rough hemp ropes, leading them away in strings.</p>
<p>When walking along the way, they are not allowed to shout or cry. Violating these two "orders" will result in a severe beating. Anyone who attempts to escape will be immediately shot and killed. After arriving at their destination, each person is given an iron hoe or a shovel, and they are ordered to start digging, digging, and digging non-stop in the designated place—</p>
<p>At night, it is time to rest. The place to sleep is the trench that they have dug with their own labor. Bitterly cold wind keeps attacking from above, and the muddy ground is icy cold below. Hungry and exhausted, they huddle together in piles. Sitting, standing, or lying down, there is no peace, and there will not be a minute of sleep all night.</p>
<p>Before dawn, they are ordered to work again: Dig! Dig! Dig non-stop!</p>
<p>As for eating, there is only one meal a day, and each person only gets a bowl of rice, weighing only four taels. Not only is there no vegetables! But there is no soup, not even pickles. Haven't you learned to eat with your hands? No! Their "order" is that you are not allowed to grab it with your hands, you can only "lick" it up like a dog eating excrement! Anyone who dares to grab it with their hands will immediately be stabbed with a bayonet. This is "light punishment," and sometimes it will result in death!</p>
<p>When it is time to go to the toilet, they are not allowed to leave the trench a single step. The "order" is to "defecate" in the trench.</p>
<p>While working, they are not allowed to talk or laugh, and even crying is not allowed. The "order" is to be quiet! Whenever the supervising × army comes, whoever sees them must bow, and must bow with a smiling face. Otherwise, it will be considered impolite and they will definitely be slapped.</p>
<p>Anyone who dies because they cannot bear the bitterness of hunger and cold, or who is beaten to death or killed for violating the "order," the "order" does not allow them to be moved for burial. Instead, their corpses are used as mud and piled on top of the trench, to thicken the dirt parapet.</p>
<p>In short, the compatriots who are taken away all sacrifice themselves in the trenches: they work in the trenches, sleep in the trenches, defecate in the trenches, and are buried in the trenches when they die—it is pitiful that there are still some compatriots who are not dead, who are forced by the enemy to dig for them! Dig!—digging non-stop!</p>
<h3>The Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you kill me?"</p>
<p>"It's too late, too late!"</p>
<p>"What time?"</p>
<p>"It should have been last night, not today."</p>
<p>She was expressing her remaining one-time friendship for today.</p>
<p>"Do you regret it?"</p>
<p>"—No!"</p>
<p>Emotional turbulence is limited: the peak of sudden change is only a moment, and after a long time, it naturally becomes ordinary. She stopped crying, gradually returned to normal, brushed her teeth, washed her face, and began the habits of daily life again. Finally, she walked away peacefully.</p>
<p>He and his comrades jointly decided on a letter to her father—the general idea was to demand five million yuan, to be delivered to a certain person at a certain place within three days. During this period, if any accident occurred that caused misfortune to the messenger... everything was guaranteed with her life. He sent a comrade to send this letter to her house.</p>
<p>Then, he found another comrade and bought her two small breads and a bottle of milk for breakfast. She suspected that the milk was poisoned, and did not even eat the small breads. At the same time, she also did not feel hungry.</p>
<p>In order to dispel her boredom, she inadvertently walked into their room. The room had changed, it was a mess, it was no longer as beautiful as last night. The tables, chairs, and all the utensils in the room were moved away from their proper positions and concentrated in a corner; the remaining open space was used as a bed for them to spend the night. They had no pillows, no bedding, only a thin felt blanket folded on the ground. They had not been up for long, and had no time to tidy up. Their clothes, which had been pressed into a pile, had not yet been unfolded. There were fewer of them than last night, now there were only three people left; some were tidying up the room, seemingly afraid that someone would see through some kind of flaw, others were biting on old buns that seemed to be from yesterday, eating them especially sweetly. The cheapest buns, compared to their neat clothes and wealthy appearance, were indeed an extremely disharmonious imaginative construct, and not a page of true portrayal. Therefore, it aroused in her a kind of inexplicable strangeness.</p>
