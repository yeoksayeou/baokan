<h3>抗戰，經濟建設與土地問題　中國地政學會年會及其決議案全文</h3>
<p>（本報特稿）</p>
<p>中國地政學會第五屆年會，於四月廿三廿四兩日在川東師範禮堂舉行。</p>
<p>這次年會，正値枕戰將轉入新階段的時期。　開二十六年四月間在靑島舉行的四屆年會，巳經足足二年。二年內，中國有了新的進步，而且和那時相比，也絕對的不同。一個顯明的事實，就是開會的地址，今天在戰時的首都——重慶！</p>
<p>為因戰區的隔　，和交通的阻絕，影響到會　的參加困雞了，可是，事實上這次到會的人數，竟達八十餘人，超過四届年會，說　了地政學者對于土地問題的注視，自然大多教會員集中重麼，也是一個原因。</p>
<p>會場輪廓</p>
<p>大會於十三日上午，開幕，出席者八十二人。有實際辦理地政的人員，從國民政府立法院土地委員會，內政部土地司起，以至各省市地政局，懇區人員止，大半都參加。另外一部份是國民黨中央政治學校地政學院的院長，敎授，和硏究地政問題的學者。來賓中有內政部地政學院，降軍測　局，　東省地政局，貴州財政廳，陝西民政廳，四川土地局等代表，以及地政學院第八班的全體學員二十餘人。</p>
<p>會塲座位，行行地排列，會員按號入座。每人拿着油印的提案擇要，利議事日程，以及各地地政實施報吿，懇區狀况等文件，仔細的翻閱。前排幾行是坐着該會理事會及年會籌委會等人物。蔣委員長的「土地問題之解决為實行民生主義首要之急務』和「抗戰勝利之日更為澈底推行土地政策之良機」兩點指示，寫成一付對聯式的語錄，懸挂在禮堂中央。</p>
<p>一場熱辯</p>
<p>這次會議中討論最熱烈的一幕，是二十三日　午第一次大會，對于戰時和戰後地政問題的辯論，內政部土地司長鄭振做主席。討論的題目，是會前由理事會擬定的『中國戰後土地政策』。到會的人數，據秘書長報吿是五十九人。</p>
<p>當主席宣佈題目後，請大家自由發言，原先打算由理事會决定討論項目，給各會員一個討論的範疇。但內時間不及，只由黃通先生說明一番「戰後土地政策的提出，或許社會人士非黃；為何不討論戰時？而討論戰　呢」？接着黃先生解釋；「抗戰勝利　可預測，而國家經此大的劇變，將來社會狀　及制度，必然　亂，所以討論戰後土地政策，以備政府在將來的採擇的』。</p>
<p>這個問題提出，立刻引起對于「時間性』的討論，每個人起立發言，都向着題目爭辯。『戰爭時間多長』？「戰後的情形如何』？「戰後的情形不明，怎樣　定戰後的政策』？「更不能把戰後與戰前拿來比較。』不同意討論「戰後』的人們，接連提這些辯問。他們的積極主張是；一戰時』的土地問題是　實問題，不能　開現實討論空想的「戰後」，而且，今天的土地問題正急待解　。也有的把「戰後」　「抗戰以後」解釋，也有的提出：最低限度也須把「戰時」和「戰後』一齊討。主張討論「戰後」的，　以「準　戰後』為理由外，而且可以對「戰後」作「估計』的討論。主席的意見：是因為題目為理事會所决定，自當按着討論，而且討論時也可把「戰時』和「戰後一連擊起來。免得儘管在題目上爭議，不上正題，最後，　間差不多已過二時許，為此問題發表意見者有二十人之　，只好接着討論下去。——但是，以後每一個人發　中，還屢次有先提到題目，幷旦討論沒有得到總續。</p>
<p>西南建設中的土地問題</p>
<p>在仕四日天上午二次大會，到會者仍為五十九人。討論的是「西南經濟建設與土地問題。』這是在抗戰的後方，新發生的問題。其中最重要的，是『徵收』與「補償』的問題，因做公路　道等徵用土地怎　解决？徵用土地又怎樣補償？另外是土地利用問題，和勞力，賦稅，以及地價投機，缺乏社丁等問題。</p>
<p>但各人發表意見時多談到西南建設，對於土地問題，較少精密討論，所以，時間將到了，才由羅醒　先生提出一個槪括總結，大意是；對於西南建設與土地問題，另政府有統　計劃外，應當卽設中央電政機關，依照士地法令，以為促成和解决現在巳經發生和將發生的問題。</p>
<p>第三次大會中，通過各重要提案，及决議案，與通電等。</p>
<p>總結這次年會中，除第一次大會對於『戰時』『戰後』之熱列爭辯外，其他，少有具體深刻討論，只是輪廊的談到，便大體結束了。</p>
<p>中　地政學會第，屆年會，於四月廿四日晨八時舉行總理紀念週後，繼續舉行第二次會議，首宣讀孔院長致大會祝詞，後討論西經濟建設與土地問題，至十二時始畢。下午二時，仍繼續舉行第三次會議，首由提審委會報吿審査意見，並將提案五件提出討論：（一）政請建議政府積極實行「耕者有其田』政策，以增加生產安定農　充實國力案；（二）非常時期地政墾殖應由地政機關主辦案；（三）擬請建議中央從速成立地政機關，以期推行戰時及戰後土地政策案；（四）擬　建議中央劃陝北第二區為本黨平均地權實騐區案；（五）戰區减免土地租稅及補救拼地荒廢暫行辦法草案等五案，均分別依照審査意兒通過。　由會務審委員報吿對過去會務　行極滿意，次討論會章修改事宜。臨時動　以大會？義分電國民黨蔣總裁及前方將士致敬。最後選舉肅　，曾濟寬，鄭震宇，萬國鼎，祝半，　患蓀，黃通，李愛麐，張廷休飽德，高信，唐啟宇，劉岫靑，關吉玉，郭漢嗚等十五人為　五　理事，周之佐，羅霞天，林欽辰，王先强，朱宗良，蔣廉，馮紫崗，駱美興，李如漢　九人為候補理事，至七時許閉會，茲將該會通過之「中國戰後土地政策」「西南經濟建設與土地問題「兩項决議案　別誌次；</p>
<h3>中國戰後土地政策</h3>
<p>關於我國土地政策之指　原則及辦法綱領，總理遺敎早經昭示，本會歷屆年會，亦已有相當具體之決議案可　遵循，今茲為完成民族自由，國家獨立而抗戰，則三民主義國家之建設，自當急速進　，平均地權之特特，卽在於大破壞以後，新建設開始之祭，實施和平的社會革命。民十六國府成　時，因預籌未固，坐失良機，故在抗戰勝利之日，應立卽按照預定方案，實行總理遺敎所昭示之政策，以建立民生主義之新土地制度，其要　如下：</p>
<p>一·戰後國　應卽頒布緊急法令，整理地權，凡經戰事破壞之區域，尤應以迅速有效方法，調　人地之分配，恢復農村之繁榮。故（一）佃耕制度盛行區域，戰後應卽運用土地金融機構，調整地權，以實現　者有其田。（二）因戰事致人民流亡，土地荒蕪之處，凡無主地均應用以轉授耕者。（三）人口稠密地權碎　之沿海沿江各省縣，戰後應卽舉辨土地需要登記就人地多募，調劑寬狹之分配。（四）邊區汲人口咬稀之各省縣，戰後舉行大規機之移殖工作，並試行大農經營。（五）在積極建設之前，應卽實行累進地價稅及增値稅，以防止壟斷，而使建設之利歸公（六）因戰事徵用之人民土地，戰後應予充分補償，或以其他土地折算補償云（七）因戰事流亡人民之返歸故土者，所有在戰時未繳之地稅及佃農未繳之地，一律豁免。</p>
<p>二，戰後經濟建設開始之時，應積極推行土地整理工作於工業區域交通中心及海港都會等處，尤應先定地價並頒布漲價歸公之法令。故：（一）因戰事影響致土地及其定　物之原狀變更者，應依照建　　劃，禁止任意恢復原狀。（二）主要建設地區，應於　劃公布之前，預先徵收計劃中所需之土地。（三）因戰事破　及新興都市，應預定鄱市計劃及分區方法，並得於土地測量登　未完成前，舉行地價申報。</p>
<p>三，戰後士地利用，應求適合現代經濟發展之趨勢，重視的合理農業經營，尤以經×人破壞較劇處，應於收復之初，重耕地，創設標準自耕農揚，使流亡疾苦之農民，得充分之生活保證．故：（一）土地經營過於細分之區，應迅速實行重劃，並提　及合作經營。（二）自　農場太少者，戰後迅速調整，給予適量之土地，准給於理想之標準，（三）天然富源及含有獨　性之土地，戰後應由國家資本開發之，並應注重地方之保存。</p>
<p>四，戰後復員之際，凡為國出力，參加戰爭之將士，國家應優予酬庸，授田自耕，傷亡家屬及流亡災民，亦應予以適量之土地，以示撫恤，故：（一）徵收不在地主之土地，或儘先以公有土地分配於願意歸農之士兵。（二）因戰事死傷者之家屬及流　災民，縱無　作能力，亦宜予以土地，尤許在相當時期內出租或僱工耕工。（三）邊防重要地帶，宜移精銳軍隊及其家屬實行屯墾。</p>
<p>五，為實行以上四項，戰後地政機構之充實與建立，地籍整理之普遍推行及地政　員之訓練　均為當務之急，應卽先為準備。故（一）中央及各省縣應卽迅速擴大地政機關之職掌，充實其內容，淪陷省　於收復之初，應卽成立地政機關，實施土地管理。（二）淪陷各地方原無圖籍或圖籍散失者，應於收復之初，卽行着手整理，面後方各省尤應於經濟建設開始之前，施行地籍整理。（三）地政人人應分高中初三級，卽行分別大量訓線。</p>
<h3>西南經濟建設與土地問題</h3>
<p>當此抗戰順利進行之際，為充愛抗戰力量，樹立建國基礎起見，應由中央先定整個經濟建設之計劃，西南經濟建設為整個建設之初步，其建設計劃任全國經濟建設計劃中，應佔一極重要之地位。土地為凡百經濟建設之是本要素，故在實施　南經濟建設之時，對于土地問題先有縝密計劇，具體方法，以確立經濟建設之根基，俾建設工作順利進行，國民經濟健全發展，關　西南經濟建設進展中，所應注意之土地問題，解决辦法略列如次：</p>
<p>一，因施經濟建設而徵收之土地，應審度實情，分別予以補償。</p>
<p>二，凡經濟建設中心區域，及水陸交通沿綫之新巿　，應先規定地價，所有因經　建設之實施而增高之地價，應　充經　建設之資金。</p>
<p>三，在西南經濟　設區域中之荒　，宜於大規模之墾殖者，應由政　組織公營農場經營之：其他荒地應獎勵私人或團　分別承墾，以便增加抗戰之物質，充實抗戰之力量．</p>
<p>四，本區域內之農林牧礦等地，應依自然環境社會條件劃定區域，分別使用，以謀土地利用之調整，而免地力之喪失；至於因經濟建設之新興市鎭。應先詳密股計，俾土地有合　的利用，而　畸形之發展。</p>
<p>五，在墾區內租　制虔，應依照民生主義之原則，力謀改善，同時應積極創設自耕農場。</p>
<p>六，為充實經濟建設資力，活動經濟建設之金融起見應設立土地農業金融關機，俾建設工作易於　展</p>
<p>七，一切經濟建設，莫不以土地測量為基礎，所有本區內各項，建設土地測量工作，應由政府統籌計劃，續先　理。</p>
<p>八，為統西南經濟建設區域內地政工作之進行，應先設立專管　關，負責計劃切實施行。</p>
<h3>平衡物價問題</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>雖則現在誰都感覺到物價貴得利害，可是各人都以為這是戰　應有的現象。事實確然如此，而且中外一律，大家為了戰時應有的現象，便都咬緊牙關忍耐。這足以反映全體國民堅苦卓絕的犧牲精神；是値得向世人自　的。</p>
<p>不過我們决不能以其為勢所必然，便任其所之，因為有不少人，便在利用這種理由，操縱着物價，故意抬高，為了國家民族的整個利益，任何人固應　定犧牲一切的精神，但事實上我們也不能否認；物質生活上的忍耐，畢竟有一定的限度。同時更應考慮的；國民生活被高價物壓迫到不能維持的時候，對於抗戰是不會有什麽帮助的。</p>
<p>而且信問題，與其說，「目前已有切實解决的必要」母寧說「為了將來的安全，在巳非先籌「防微杜漸之計不可』，因為當前物價飛漲的主要原因，旣都知道與戰事有關，那末，在戰爭尙無結束希望的今後，也就在刺激物價飛漲的一切原因繼續存在的今後，勢必還有無限沸騰的危險，可是無疑義的，</p>
<p>（二）物價高漲的理由分析</p>
<p>戰爭的存在，為什麽足以刺激物價飛漲？這理由很簡單，就拿現在的事實來說吧，</p>
<p>（一）戰前國家的經費，最多不過八九億元左右，像民廿六年度的總　算開了空前的高紀錄，也不過十億元多些，但從戰事發生以來，因為軍費的急速增大，據說已超過仕五億元以上，這就是說：商品的需要量幾較平時超過二倍以上，需要增加，物價當然也要增加，像上海，又因人口驟增，需要也就大增，但這不是　要的因素，因為，</p>
<p>（二）如果需要增加的同時，生產也能同比率增加：那未物價的上升，還可　着曲線進行，不致越漲越高，可是我們的生產事業，平時已那麽落後，戰時又被破壞到不堪一親，不特是工業設備已殘破不堪，廣大的農民，在戰區裏也都輟耕。加以日軍的到處掠奪，更增大了物資的消耗，擴大了供需不平衡的闊度</p>
<p>（三）國內生產激減，外加日方的掠奪，我國的出口能力於是大减特减，出口减，便影饗少到國際收支平衡，加以我國的軍需品以　民需品，大都仰　海外，於是幣化的本身　　感受威脅，何况日方又竭力搗亂我國的外匯，自發生外匯　市場以來，幣値竟　去四折左右；幣値跌落，淮口物價勢必飛漲尤烈．因此政　與民間購用外貨的貨幣負担尤大．國內流通的通貨量，自然也非增加不可。</p>
<p>（四）通貨流動額增大時，如果商品的流通圓滑，那末通貨剌激物價的程度，還可在交易率的增大中消減下去。可是戰區的　通綫，又皆為日方控制，貨運就是依　外商，也不能應付裕如，因此供需失調的形勢更見嚴重，物價上升的勢力也就更雄健。</p>
<p>（五）在商品流通過程內，除了貨運困難之外，還有許多阻碍，日偽在戰區內沿途對物敲索，今旦進而推行其所　「貿易斜制」，此外運費，保險費，和內匯匯水增漲等等，也無不都在加强供需失調物價漲勢的程度。</p>
<p>這許多刺激物價的壓力，都是戰爭的產物，戰事存在一天，那末上昇的可能，也就有在一天。由戰爭造成的這些高物價的苦痛，我們固可以最使勝利的收穫來抵消，可是除了這些自然理由外，還有投機，錄　，　斷，居奇等等現象：而且這些現象於物價上的影響，來勢更兇，在各種貨物價格內　算出投機價格所佔的地位，果然不可能，但是也可隨便舉個例來證明，他在現在物價水準裏所佔何種程度？</p>
<p>（三）物價水準　的投機價格</p>
<p>譬如去年底至今年初，上海米的存倉數，實際並未减少。以米市季節來說，這是全年內米價最軟弱的時期，但這次却反乎常例，忽開始急漲，飛漲的理由：據說為了日軍收買，所以上海有米荒危險，大家競爭囤購，為防荒國購，固無不可，但可疑的何以米價　到十四元的限界，便不再上界？如何眞有米免危險，卽使有强有力的統制下也會發生暗市，像去年春發生米荒時的暗市一樣，而且米價漲到十四元，日軍何以不再繼　收買　如說貴了收買要吃虧，但日軍收買任何東西，都不照市價給錢。貴不貴　與收不收，根本不聯繫、後來聽說，這次米價的漲風，可當上海米商的一不平之嗚一看。因為現在除了米價一項還和戰前相等外，其他皆已大漲特漲。</p>
<p>現在高物價的內素之一是外匯關係，米價固不受遭種影　，因為他們是土產品之故。但棉花也是土產品，何以他個能像米價一樣穩定？如果說為了需要，那未花的需要不見得比米更大？如果說因為日偽統制和苛征，米也何曾不受同等待遇　但是現在棉花　市價，巳較戰前半年平均價漲起百分之五十以上，棉價的上漲除了供需等事實原因外，大半原　實在被飛漲的紗價帶起的，試看去年一至椒月，紗價是不斷上漲，棉價是漲跌互見，因此去年全年紗價平均較廿六年一至八月漲起三二·三％，而棉花價反跌二·一％，今年一月紗價，較戰前八個月平均漲五二，九％，棉價亦帶漲至四四·％，（見經濟統計月誌本年一月號第六　表</p>
<p>何以紗價會如是激漲了當然與前述的許多理由都有關，但投機成分更有關係。雖則　生產減少上，可以提出漢多關於生產設備被　的數字來證明，但上海畢竟是棉　的出產地，供給總比他地容易。在流通上並無使紗價大漲的理由，而且他是國產，也無通貨影響。上海紗價　有支配全國紗價的地位。如果他的　格確屬合理，那末不能利用內地的需要便任意高價待沽。但　在都因內地紗價奇昂，上海紗價也就盡　提高，所以弄成今日越漲越貴的情形。要知利用需要來高　待沽，這正就是投機操織的伎倆之一。</p>
<p>我們不妨再從別地上來比較，上海物的漲勢，較內地實在還要厲害。為了材料限制，姑以民廿六年七月及民廿七年八月比較一番，</p>
<p>上海與內地之物價指數比較（一九三七年全年平均物價為基期）</p>
<p>（註）上海廣州原係一九二六年為基準，改算以一九三七年全年平均為基期，俾與以一九三七年為　凖之重慶指數化較如上，材料參看中國國民經濟研究所出版中外經濟年報。</p>
<p>上海在廿六年巳發生戰爭，其時粵川居後方，把該年全年平均物價做基準，與以後的物價比較，照理上海應比內地的增加率為低，　竟適得其反；　已由方變為後方的民廿七年八月時的上海物價，反較內地漲得利害。以內地物價昂貴為影，上海物價的理由，顯然不能成立，且　證上海投機程度遠駁各地利害。</p>
<p>（四）高物價與戰時經濟</p>
<p>依一般的說來，物價和國民的購買力是互為因果的，物價漲，國民收人啦加，因之民購買力也隨之增加，如物價漲過國民購尚力水凖之上，國民消費必自然縮减：因之物價　必隨之下降。至國民購買力相等為止，但這以生產發達，秩序安定為條件，並且事實上還不能十足兌現，因為工資决無與物同比例上昇，所以高物價只有削弱　民購買力的事實，很少有增强國民購貿力的可能，試看下表，上海工廠工人的平均工資，二十七年僅較二十六年增加一，八％。但此時的工人生活費皆巳增加二九，四％，這便是明　的事實。</p>
<p>上海工人生活費及工資指數比較表</p>
<p>二十六年</p>
<p>二十七年</p>
<p>工人生活費指數（三）　一二四·一一　一六〇·六〇</p>
<p>工廠工人工資指數（二）　一〇〇·〇〇　一〇一·八〇</p>
<p>貨幣購買力（一）　八〇·五七　六二·二七</p>
<p>（註一）根　國際工局中國分局編製數字、</p>
<p>（二）工資指數，根據　濟統計研究所出版「經濟統計月誌」本年一月號「上海工廠工人每月平均工資表」核算而得，何况我國的生產，旣異常落後，現在又處於戰事破壞一切生產設備的時期，所以物價高漲，一方面是反映貨幣對外價値的鐵落，他方面是加强洋貨對我國民財富剝削力量，換　話說：足以促成我國財政金融，幣制，以及整個國民經濟於潰亡，</p>
<p>從表面上看：買辦資本（專營推銷外貨的商人之類）和凖買辦資本（如以洋　為原料的生產者，及其製品　販　者等等）的收益，或許也有部份的增加。從　造成銀行　款賬面上的景氣。但既各能補償　財富資本的貨幣　値之損失，更不能補價整個國民財富上的損失。那是　而易見的。</p>
<p>從事實上看：國內物　的高漲，現已使國民全體的生活感受酷辣的威會，這種威脅不消滅，甚至再擴大，結果便有動搖整個社會治安的危險，更危險的將使戰爭的經濟基礎直接受其搖撼，最近英國貸欵中國，協　平衡外匯，如果不談政治意義，而分　其經濟意義時，則誰都曉得一在維持他對華輸出的商品市場」。換句話說：只因中國的物價，業已超過一般　買力水凖　使他們在華的　品市場，在日方的暴力阻碍之外，復　立一大阻碍。平衡中國的匯率即所以防止中國的進口物價之續漲罷了。而且我們重視這個問題題　理由，與其說是由於現在的必要，母　說是為了未來，不能不先籌「防微杜漸　之。因為當前物價飛漲的主因，旣然由於戰事影響；那末在戰事尙無結束布望的今後，也就是在刺激物價飛漲的一切原因繼續存在的今後，勢必還有無限沸騰的危險。</p>
<p>（五）國府平衡物價的對策</p>
<p>國府對於戰時物價，早有統制决心；只因這種統制，在　濟組織極周密的歐美谷國，尙未稅　　試　段：德國一適正價格制度」，雖受世人贊道，但在經濟組織象一盤散沙的中國，實無模仿餘地，　事實上既已不容長此放任，而且若能把物價中的投機因素　除，就可平衡不少。只要各業都能放平良心。　可刃迎而解。所以最近終於分令各省市政府。分　組織平衡物價委員會，與各省銀行及地方銀行等　力合作，實行平衡人民日常必需品的價格，並規定平價標準三種：</p>
<p>（一）凡物品之生產及運銷成本，未受戰事影響或影響甚微者，以戰前一年或一年之平均價為凖</p>
<p>（二）凡物品之生產及運銷成本，受戰事影響者，以其在戰後之成本再加相當之利潤為標準</p>
<p>（二）凡物品之成本不計算者，以具經營所需之資本　額，再加相當之利潤為標準，並規定平衡物價之物品以日用必需品為限</p>
<p>平衡物價委員會的組織，係由地方政府及省銀行或地方銀行，曁商會同　公會等共同組織。安於工廠商號或私人，得依照農礦工商管理條例向法院檢舉之</p>
<p>（一）同業間互為買賣數量，不得超過存貨現量</p>
<p>（二）非經營日用必需品之同業，不得互為買賣市場上之期貨。</p>
<p>（三）買賣日用必需品，不得試立交易所市場</p>
<p>但在全國　濟上，迄今仍占重大地位的上海，又是投機最烈，物價飛漲最快的地方，却已不幸包圍在淪陷區裏，政治力量，己不能發生積極作用，要　是由民間出而自冶，簡直　無從進　。所以上海市民能否解除物價上的不當剝削和酷，的壓迫？只在看各業領袖能否用而支持和努　這　點了</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>波蘭的危局與英國</h3>
<p>東歐最近的變化又到捷克亡國前的情勢了。日前「每日郵報」傳希特勒巳向波蘭提出數項要求，限十四日內答復。其所要求的要點是（一）割讓但澤給德國，（二）准許許國由德邊境築一軍路通過波蘭走廓以達東普魯士；（三）沿途一帶劃為特區，德人可享受治外法權。這無異於準備一方面宰割波蘭的四肢，一方面又用一枝尖刀直刺波蘭的心臟。同時，這幾天，德國又一齊發動輿論拼命攻壑波蘭，並誣波蘭有兼併東普魯士的陰謀（漢堡某報）。德波邊境各大城市又都調動大軍，準備有所動作。德國吞併捷克當時，是採用了這個手勢，希特勒能不再温習一下舊夢，甜密的舊夢，誰都不敢相信。</p>
<p>歐美人士對於希特勒的積極東進，巳懷莫大的憂慮，在過去幾次暴行的推測，皆不幸而言中。最近美國的「智識雜誌』又推測五月中旬，軸心國家將有一番的動作，民主國家也被逼而以强硬的態度相同旋，其結果，非軸心國家向後撤退，就是世界大戰瀑發，這個五月中旬大動亂的測預，或者就是指着希待向波蘭的進攻。現在波蘭所處的情勢完全和被割裂乃至被吞併前的捷克沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>這種情勢在波蘭固然甚為緊張而又危險，但在英法民主國家，却也不能等閒相看，因為這次動亂的開始將不能如捷克亡國後當時得一個暫時的安定；或將連三接四地地發更大的事變。正如「格林維區時　　主筆威廉氏的論文所揭露：一德國參謀本部巳擬具計劃，將出其不意，派兵在英格蘭島南岸及威爾斯島登陸一；「希特拉並且認為德兵如果能在該兩島登陸，則不出四個月的作戰期間，便可把英國征服」。希特勒的砲口現在竟描準英國的胸口了。同時，波闌鑒於捷克亡國之痛已準備抵抗，波闌又與捷克不同，捷克當時只有英法的保證，而波蘭今日則與蘇聯締結密切的關係。東歐的和平陣線且率先有相當健全的發展。希特勒不發作則巳，發作則事勢之發展將不能止於局部的解决。</p>
<p>這裏，英法的態度與决心，就佔着極重要的地位了。英法始終向德意求妥協，貪圖新根基的和平，巳經不出我們連日社評的推測與指正，完全沒有結果了。今後的問題只是如何採用有効的方法制止侵略者了，英國本國的軍備與動員準備固甚積極，但其締造集體反侵略的努力則尙嫌不够，不但步驟　緩，態度亦極暖昧。英國在遠東方面又碰到德意帮兇的日本强硬的警告，英國所處的地位確實需要個一堅决而敏捷的措置。美國方面也因鑒於世界局勢之動蕩，危機日益深逼，準備修正動員計劃，俾使在三個月內能動員百萬人，以應付突變的時　局。這於英國對付遠東的局面，是種有利的條件。他方面，蘇聯對東歐諸小國援助的保證，也漸眞體化，這於英國處理歐洲的問題，是種有力的助力。聞歐洲將於最近期內儘先組十三國的聯合陣線。我們企望着英國積極促成這個有利的局面！</p>

<h3>現代的花木蘭—唐桂林</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>【江山通訊】湖南女子唐桂林易服從軍，過了八個年頭的戰場生活，佳話流傳，國人很多要想知道其中的底蘊。記者前次自皖南發電報吿時，唐還在浙東玉山，無緣訪晤，前特地從皖南來江山專訪，她又已離浙往皖，隨軍工作去了，人遐緣慳，悵惘得很。因遍訪××師××團舊部屬，搜集一些側面的材料，先作簡括的叙述。</p>
<p>『唐女士的設話，帶湘西的口音，她的家世，我們可不十分淸楚，她在××師，只有一個年頭。當我們這一師在湖南××整理的時候，她是和具他一部份屬于××師的士兵，一同撥過來的。她的大部份從軍生活，是在××師的前身——××××團。她的身軀很高大，皮膚也不怎樣白凈，這也許是在戰塲上過得太久，風塵吹薰的緣故。』</p>
<p>以上這幾節零零碎碎的答話，使記者約略構成一個女戰士的輪廓，記者又曾擬定幾個簡單的問題，作進一步的搜索。</p>
<p>記者：『也有人疑心地的動止沒有？』</p>
<p>陳君：『誰會想到女化男裝，那是小說上的事呀。打仗又不是好玩的事，她走路那麽大踏步，那麽走得快。體還會起什麽發心？』</p>
<p>徐君：『她的睛眼倒是很秀美的。』</p>
<p>陳君：『你知道她是一個女子，自然覺得她的秀美　。不過也奇怪，自從發見是女兒身，連她自己也羞澀起來，她不再當兵，當看護去了。』</p>
<p>記者：『這回又怎麽發見的呢？』</p>
<p>陳君：『和她同排的班長，定要邀她去洗澡，她老是不肯，和班長別扭了，一別扭，就露馬脚了。」</p>
<p>記者：『聽說她在東菇嶺戰役，還掛過彩呢。怎麼連醫生看護婦都看不出呢？』</p>
<p>陳君：「她傷的是脚踝，聽說她自幼是男裝的　她的父母只養她一個人，把她當作男孩子看待，她說她自己也早忘記是女兒身了。」</p>
<p>記者：「她眞是很勇敢呀！」</p>
<p>徐君：「他們說她打仗時候，很沉着，倒是一個很好的機關槍射手。東菇嶺那一仗，×人的炮火可眞利害，那幾個山頭奪來奪去，也不知幾多囘，唐女士她衝過好幾次鋒，直到掛了彩才下來，她這回要不是顯出了本來的面目，她要升班長了。」</p>
<p>間接的村料，只有這麽一些兒，再詳細的叙述，且等待記者直接去訪問來。　（中央社）</p>

<h3>國際現勢縱橫談</h3>
<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>著者廖　聖君，為前國立中山大學農學院及嶺南人學商學院敎授，廣西省府經　委會專門委員，撰此文之目的。乃自最近國際形勢之綜合分析，反映我國抗戰前途之樂觀，內容　實，關於美國經濟資源，外交通向，總統權力諸端之探討，尤為詳盡，用特介紹於左，以供研究國際關係者之參攷。</p>
<p>一，引言</p>
<p>捷克亡矣，國際秧序，條約尊嚴，於斯蕩然。是豈僅弱小民族之不幸；抑亦近代文明之奇恥！雖然，人羣進化，每由痛苦之經騐得來。捷克之犧牲固不乏相當之代價者。蓋此悲劇之導演且握歐局關鍵之英國當軸，遭斯棒喝，巳痛悟前非，毅然決然，亟圖與民主國家互相提携，力遏侵略　潮之再度蔓延也。茲者，波，羅，希諸國之獨立，旣獲英，法之宣言保證；英，法，蘇合作又在積極談判之中。一時西歐，尤其地中海之風雲反告緊急。此卽大戰之前夕　？抑獨裁者之迴光反照歟？舉足輕重之蘇，美其反應何若耶？我國當局，對此良機，究應如何運用耶？謹紓管見，一申論之。</p>
<p>二，美國實力及其外交動向之概括檢討</p>
<p>據訪問英自妯黨自領　克萊氏者，詢問關於對日作戰及實施經濟制裁諸問時，辛克萊氏一再以『視乎美國之態度為轉移』作答。其實，英國反侵略態度之急轉直下，美國輿論與實質之鼓勵，亦與有力焉。其影響初非限於遠東一隅也，遠隔重洋之美國，果何由而為世界政治舉足輕重之因素乎？謂就其實力與外交動向，一加檢討，而窮其究竟。</p>
<p>就國防之立場言，一國實力之强弱，恆視其若干重工業發展之程度及其經濟資源之盈虛以為斷。美國重工業規模之宏大。設備之台理，生產能力之高强，旣非歐洲列强得而望其項背，其經濟資源之充實尤非他國所可比擬，據一九三七年各國生產狀况之比較，美國　鐵鑄塊之生產能力，可年達七千二百萬噸，如環境需要，於兩年期內，更可擴充至年產一萬萬噸以上，其他列强，年來雖積極擴軍，其年產之總和要亦不過七千六百萬噸耳。摩托車之造製其差別尤足驚人，是年美國汽車工廠雖因工潮而關閉者再，其產額尙不下五百萬輛；而其餘世界各國產額合計亦僅一百三十萬輛耳。至若煤油之生產，列强更無比較之可言，蓋美國與南美洲合計，巳佔全球產量百分之七十七矣。此外全球金的硬幣操自該國之手者計佔全數百分之六十。夫鋼鐵為工業與軍備建設之基礎；汽車為機械化步隊之骨幹；媒油乃近代武噐之血液；現貨為左右金融巿場最有效之武器；今以一國之力，或則足與全球相埒，或更凌駕而上之，其為世界和平之關鍵，於斯概見矣。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，今之侵略國家，惟其力圖軍事上經濟自足，其仰賴於美國者益切。比年以來，美農產品之輸出，較諸一九二六至一九三〇年（美國商業全盛時代）之平均輸出額，低降百分之六十。第舉凡與擴軍有關之機械原料，其輸出則突飛猛進。例如，一九三七年其運貨汽車之輸出，三倍於疇昔之商業全盛時代（卽一九二六年至一九三〇年之乎均）；飛機則八倍有奇；原料石油則三倍，廢鐵則十六倍；鋼鐵製成品亦超過全盛時代百分之七十七。此外電器設備，化學工業用品曁其他一切工業機械，無一不較前激增。考其主要顧客則英，蘇而外，惟德，意，日三大侵略國家而巳。觀此，益見美國祇憑其經濟武噐，亦足制侵略者之死命而有餘矣。</p>
<p>美國輿情之於法西斯集團，因政治思想之根本背馳，又羅斯福總統遠大眼光之不斷鼓勵與薰陶，不獨始終與之對立，且其厭惡之心與日彌深。惟其行政當局，旣碍於孤立派之從中作梗，復苦於立法機關之諸多牽制，除言論之攻訏外，每乏積極或行動上之建樹，可堪吿慰者，此沉悶之局面。最近巳有逐漸打破之跡象。蓋仁智兼全之羅斯福總統，巳就其憲法上所賦予之權力範圍內，毅然决然，予侵略者以事實之打擊矣，</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>女子出路問題</h3>
<p>從一個徬徨的女子說起</p>
<p>今天本報港聞版刊登一篇奇卓君的「她，捐了綫，昏下去！』這篇紀錄裏包含着一個目前女子的出路問題。我們認為這是一個嚴重的社會問題，而和抗戰建國前途，有很重大的關係。</p>
<p>岑女士是一個有六位母親的富家的女兒，一向被禁閉在封建的樊籠裏面，而時代的潮流，民族解放的呼聲，終於把她鼓動起來，在廣州基督敎靑年會的戰時兒童學校，為國家社會服務。不過自從×人的鐵蹄踐踏到我們革命的聖城以後，她就失去了服務的機會，政府機關和救亡團體也沒有注意到她，於是就成為迷途的羔羊，四顧茫茫，找不到工作，看到的是使她痛憤的黑暗與罪惡！滿腔熱情無着落，竟至在憤激的演詞中昏倒在大衆面前。</p>
<p>其實，舉目四顧，空懷着熱情。不能為國家社會服務，不能為自身爭取自由的女子，眞是盈千累萬，又何止岑女士一人！知識婦女尙且如此，其他認識不及岑女士的家庭婦女以至勞動婦女，又不知多少！具有國家社會觀念充滿求解放的熱情的女子尙且如此，其他億萬渾渾噩噩地在苦難中掙扎的婦女又將如何？這是今日努力于民衆動員與抗戰建國事業的人士所不容忽略的問題。</p>
<p>大家都已知道，目前婦女只有參加抗戰建國，爭取了民族解放以後，婦女出路問題才有眞正解决的一天。而參加抗戰建國事業，第一就要英勇地堅决地參加集體生活，從集體生活中努力學習注意修養，增加婦女團結力量，爭取婦女服務抗戰建國的機會，增進婦女在社會上在政治上的地位。目前許多集團，雖然未能盡滿人意，甚至還存在許多令人悲憤的現象，然而求解放本來就是一種鬥爭，如果好人個個潔身引退，那麽社會集團就永遠沒有進步的希望了。這是我們要求岑女士和千千萬萬找不到出路的女子，深切認淸，控制情感，奮鬥前進的。</p>
<p>其次，目前抗戰建國事業，在在需要人才；婦女團體方面，更待充實力量，擴展陣綫；然而另一方面則仍有許多人士找不到工作而至於悲憤至於昏倒，這是社會領袖份子所不能不負責的！我們殷切期望各團體　互間能够泯除成見，互讓互助，切實工作，大家注意及擢引各方眞正人才，充實力量，增進效力。同時還要展開婦女動員工作到家庭婦女和等動婦女中間去，不僅可以使廣大散漫無力的婦女振作起來，成為抗戰建國的雄偉的生力軍，而且可以提拔出許多新的幹部，作為婦女解放運動的中堅，準備根本解决女子出路問題。這又是我們所誠懇祈望於婦女團體與社會各界領袖之努力的！</p>

<h3>抗戰必勝的實據</h3>
<p>— 亢直</p>
<p>觀抗戰特輯第六集之後</p>
<p>特寫　『抗六特輯第六集』昨天試演過了，無疑的。這是血的史實，中藥民族新生的紀錄。前綫英勇浴血的將士們，用熱血來　開民族自由之花。德安大捷與　山孤軍苦鬥，充分表現每個將士為了取爭勝利，視死如歸的大無畏精神。反映後方動態的每個鏡頭，是充分表現與前綫相配合，相呼應。同胞們不分老幼的踴躍輸將，歡送將士出征的熱烈，可看出軍民一條心，是空前的奇蹟。而慰勞負傷戰士及募衣運動之如火如荼，亦都是象徵着華民族抗戰勝利的先兆！</p>
<p>為了領袖肖像映上銀幕而使觀衆們噸立致欲，不禁使人回憶某淪陷區裏，×人強佔着　家未全毀的電影院，利用作　毒化我淪陷同胞的一種宣傳工具，×人憑着虛構造謠來離間我們的團結，沖傷我們的領袖，而那些電影的演出，使廣大觀眾更感動地對領袖的偉大加深認識，而亦肅立致敬，拍掌，×偽警亦弄得束手無法干涉。抗戰意志的統一是每個有血氣的同胞所具有的，無論在戰區抑或後方，除却一班別具心肝無血的漢奸外。最後我們希望僑胞們個個看到這抗戰特輯的影片，內地甚至於淪陷區同胞能看到這　戰特輯的影片。好讓我們加强自信力，更積極地以奮鬥來迎接勝利的明天！</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>千萬個苦悶女性中的一個　她，捐了錢，昏下去</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>以理智控制情感，參加進步的集體生活去吧！</p>
<p>前天午夜十二時，一黃花崗一演至『尾聲』的時候，在極度緊張空氣籠罩之下，突有一個靑年女性，突然登台，慷慨陳詞，全體為之愕然。她的說話，開始還說得很鎭定：『諸位，對不起，恕我失禮說幾句：我太興奮了，我太感動了！我們佔全人口半數的女子應該澈底覺悟起來，我現在量力捐出這五元錢，撫恤陣亡將士家屬。希望在座諸位鼓勵丈夫，鼓勵兒子，保衛我們的國家，這樣才對起總理和七十二烈士在天之靈……』可是，她因為興奮過度，措詞以後重複而凌亂了！這邊走來，那邊走去，頻頻向總理及黃花崗烈士遺像行禮，聲聲口口說對不起，「失禮」得很。</p>
<p>這究竟是事前導演先生先先暗示的有準備的觀衆呢？還是眞正的自發的觀衆呢？在座的觀衆弄得莫名其妙。</p>
<p>舞台上的主席趁着她說話稍為停頓的時候，很機敏地接下去，高呼了口號。始得圓滿閉幕。</p>
<p>很多人擁上去問究竟，才知道她是觸景傷情的眞正觀衆，從廣州逃難來港的，姓名岑××，住在太子道××號，因為興奮過度，終於暈倒下去，救護之後，精神才漸吿恢復。記者趕囘報館時，巳是深夜一時，因排板不及。只有一小段特訊於昨天和讀者見面而已。這不是一個單純的問題，記者昨天特地　往訪問岑女士的底細。</p>
<p>見了面，先對她的勇氣與熱情表示敬意，並慰問精神的健安。岑女士很誠懇地說：『謝謝，精神已經復原了！我很抱歉，昨晚理智控制不了感情，在檯上越講越不自然，觀衆有的在笑我失常，我是知道的。唉！我要說的話實在太多了！』——她很與奮地滔滔講下去</p>
<p>小康而又封建是她的家庭背景。住在廣州的西關。因為父親經商，思想又十分腐舊，終於在廣州協和女師肄業中途被迫停學。一年後，連家庭敎帥亦沒有了。喜歡電影，戲劇，音樂，却又不得發展。從此，她在家裏自修古文，埋頭苦幹了六個年頭、中間因為母親逝世，自己又不得讀書，不得自由，悶在家裏的激刺太難堪了，精神上就表現了消極悲觀的狀態。</p>
<p>直到抗戰爆發，她要献身為抗戰效勞的熱情更是火一般燃燒起來。幸得廣州靑年會總幹事的介紹，她就担任了靑年會戰時兒童學校的主任敎師了。她念過敎育，十分愛護兒童，無論怎樣頑皮的學生，她有興趣去使他變好，自己亦覺得很有意義。雖然只能領到幾元錢生活費的津貼，她却得意她的精神寄托在工作，兒童，團體，國家上面了。</p>
<p>可是，×人無情的炮火把她們的學校炸毀了，一時找不到新校址，這是給她工作上一個嚴重的打擊，她又開始空虛與徨徬了。</p>
<p>十月廿一日廣州失守，二十日她才跟家人在極度危險中離開廣州到老家九江去。在九江鄉下的遭遇很不好受，迫不得已，四十天前才千辛萬苦來到香港。她認為祖國在苦鬥中來此托人之蔭，內心覺得非常痛苦，可是，力量有限，不得不暫屈在此找尋工作。</p>
<p>可是，××的印象給她太壞了！荒淫無恥的縱樂簡直不知有國難！她想加進電影界去，腐化，落伍的環境又使她不敢領敎。敎育兒童是她的本份，她亦很感興　，可是，商業化的敎育印又使她痛心疾首，她的熱情沒得發展　要服務工作亦沒得機會，黑暗包圍着她的週身，又看不到光明的一面。得不到進步與嚴肅的朋友的鼓勵，受不住惡劣的刺激。她來港不上十天，就　然要冉胃險囘到內地去，終於又給她的親戚阻住。她有錢可以過活，可是沒有工作，精神無所寄托，　非常痛苦。這次　「黃花崗」深受感動，舞台上演講的鍾啟南先生又是她四年前的導演，百感交集，遂情不自禁地登檯演講獻金，而終於興奮過度，暈厥倒地。</p>
<p>在這個典型事態之下，我們得到不少的啟示：</p>
<p>封建家庭威脅下的警覺女子何止她一人？</p>
<p>精神沒得發展而沉鬱，苦悶的女子何止她一人？看到黑暗的一面，而有不到光明的一面，有壞朋友的激剌而沒有好朋友的慰勉又何止她一人？</p>
<p>理智不能控制感情又何止她一人？</p>
<p>在抗戰中這樣的逝遇又何止她一人？</p>
<p>受抗戰戲劇的生動內容所感動又何止她一人？</p>

<h3>全國生產會議開幕　粵省戰時農業計劃　（續昨）</h3>
<p>（五）澈底改革農村合作社</p>
<p>農村合作社之設立、原為抉助農民、舉辦農村事業、以　假手于人、致蒙損害、合作社以辦理一種或一種以上有連帶關係之事業為宗旨、故有一定限制、依其性質、可分為信用、供給、牛產、運銷、消費、公用、保險等數種、本省早有農村合作社之設、但究其實際、主　者固另有其人、實非農民本身、此中癥結所在、不待明言、苟不予以澈底改革、則益農民者反足以病農民、徒使別一階層多一剝削機會耳、</p>
<p>（六）迅速設立農村倉庫</p>
<p>粮食調節、在平時已極重要、在戰時更屬先務之急、為使產銷協調、供應得宜、亟須建築倉庫與推行倉庫業務、我粵當局應卽選擇距　戰區較遠、交通便利之適當地點、由省府或縣府設立倉庫、辦理運銷儲押業務、以期　劑產銷、糧食　蓄、旣有準備、則農民經濟、可資彌補、查經濟　於去年九月二十四日制盯非常時期飼易農倉　行辦法、並於去年九月二十日以部令公佈、俾各地方遵照舉辦、實儲押貸欵、吾粵自應迅速設立、不惟糧食恐慌問題、可以局部解决、而於農民生活、亦可逐漸改善</p>
<p>（七）開展移墾事業</p>
<p>墾荒為支持長期抗戰的增加生產救濟難民之最好辦法、據廣東省振濟會救濟難民　劃綱要草案、本省當局擬選東區之南山、北區之連山、西區之新與等　為移墾區、以一萬二千戶、每戶五人計算、約可墾地六十四萬畝、其經營方法、則採集體農塲制、以期工作之合理云云、竊以為處此事機急切之際、以言墾荒、自當以時間經濟費用節省為原則、過於理想、反難實行、移墾之首應注意者、　為地點問題、與　地之肥瘠問題、地點當以距離難民區較近、而又係屬於安全地帶者為佳、地土則以熱荒為好、否則亦須選舉其較為肥沃者、以免徒勞無功、欲求移墾事業之速於開展、必須由省督導各縣政府負責辦理、以收分工合作之效、</p>
<p>（八）推廣短期作物</p>
<p>本省食糧不敷、在平時尚可仰　舶來、在戰時則海口封鎖、運輸困難、洋米亦難供給、且廣州三角洲一帶、已成戰區、種植水稻之面積、由是大减、凡屬足供糧食之一切農作物、應有擴大種植之必要、在戰時一地一城之得失、實所難免、凡屬長期作物、須經過長期間之培　始有收穫者、均無種植之可能、故為適應環境需求起見、亟應積極提倡短期作物、旣可减少被×人蹂躪摧殘之憂慮、尤可於短期間得有收穫、以資供應、吾粤多賴洋米、惟產量不敷、尤應利用熟、及斜坡地帶、視當地之氣候土宜、廣植豆類及其他一切雜糧、以滅稻類之銷費、至於優良旱稻、亦可按當地境、酌量種　、如能達供求等量、固屬所望、否則相差之量、再事改進、亦可望相抵也、</p>
<p>（九）推行戰時農村教育</p>
<p>農村之發展、　於農村敎育之普及、抗戰第二期、實為完成建國民埃　與之序幕、一切農村敎育設施、都應針對戰時需要、利用自然環境、以　中力量、訓練民衆、使每一國民、皆為健全之生產分子、更應普遍設置低級農案職業學校、短期戰時農民學校、組織戰時農業推廣服務團、戰時農村敎育服務團等、訓練人才、巡迴服務、以求普及、并以一切生產計劃、為其具體敎材、務期生產與敎育打成一片、隨時利用經營有效之公私農掦、作　實施敎育之圍地、</p>
<p>（十）全國生產會議本省應有之貢獻</p>
<p>現代戰事為國與國間人力物力財力之决賽、其經濟物質能為持久之供給、卽能得最後之勝利、行政院孔院長對於推進全國生產工作、增强抗戰力量、至為重視與努力、除設立中國工業合作協會及農產促進委員會、以突擊之方式、協助各省、促進生產事業外、並恐此種工作、祇限於局部、未得平均發展、為求將全國生產事業作一總檢討、以使確立整個計劃而資策進起見、爰有全國生產會議之召開、關於該會之　備、孔院長經派富有經驗與資望之農工業專家穆　初先生、祖任大會秘書、主持一切、本省自應遵照中央規定多派代表出席、並作切合實際需要之建議、俾在中央技術的經濟的協助下、得以完成本省之農業大計、以上十項、固犖犖大者、特舉其綱要、以為改革之方針、至於推行方案細則、仍須詳細　定、粵省各區、均適宜於茶蔗之種植、倘能利用環境、盡量發展、則茶業糖業前途、實有無限之展望他如斜坡山地、亦可大事造林、毗連湖南邊境一帶、更可廣植桐油、在此抗戰時間、尤宜先多設苗圃、以免浪費人力物力、一俟抗戰勝利以後、然後廣為種植、自可節省時間經濟、凡此種種均當特別注意、茲附帝提及、以喚起一般人之重視也、　（完）</p>

<h3>好萊塢的新趨勢　傳記片非常盛行　新片源源都在攝製中</h3>
<p>最近傳記片非常盛行、大概是鑒於『萬古流方』『左拉傳』『維多利亞女皇烈史』『舞曲大王』等營業　術俱有超特成就的結果、統計有下列十一張、</p>
<p>泰羅飽華的美國大盜Jesse　James已經攝成、合演者為亨利方達、南姗凱萊、全部五彩、菲雷亞斯坦和琴述羅吉絲的TheCastles凱絲兒夫婦是二十幾年前美國最紅的舞侶、愛琳凱絲兒（妻）今年四十五歲、為該片的劇情顧問、她的丈夫是歐戰飛機肇事而喪身的、亞斯坦羅吉絲　歷史片、還是第一遭片已攝、</p>

<p>由此可看出、好萊場最近藝術水準顯然提高、此外尚有『萬世流芳』Bean　Geste　Knights　of　the　PonndTable，Union　Pacitic，Gone　Wind雖然不是傳記性質都是歷史戰事文藝的鉅片、影迷們、期待着吧、</p>

<h3>丈夫，妻子，朋友　（四）</h3>
<p>里奧拿倒希望他能叫人簽訂業務合同也能像售票這　容易。營業的　不佳。實際上是一點也沒有生意。他沒有告訴陶麗絲。他們只能靠銀行裏的存款過活。當然這樣下去，不能維持多久。</p>
<p>次日下午，他的寓所鬧得像瘋人院。音樂會定於兩點鐘便要開始的。陶麗絲在她房裏化妝。房間內擠滿了女孩子和朋友。還有白萊夫人。還有里奧拿自己手裏拿了一條禮服褲子團團轉，要想找地方更換。房間外面，許果坐在一架小鋼琴上等待陶麗絲的囘昔，偶然在琴上彈出一兩聲。</p>
<p>『咪咪咪……！』陶麗絲認眞地在嗎着。</p>
<p>人們喧鬧了好一會。陶麗絲說：『那是可怕的！他不能不來！我需要他比世界上任何人更需要！里奧拿！露意絲勃郎森叫路道夫赫次答允來給我一次糾正的！但她告訴他的日子弄錯了。』</p>
<p>『路道夫赫次是誰？』里奧拿這慶問。終於把褲子套上了。</p>
<p>密昔可白萊答道：『全國報紙上評判音樂的最有名的人。』</p>
<p>陶麗絲說：『能得到他的良好的批評比什麼都有價值！他的電話是私人的，我們不知道號碼，所以不能打電話去。里奧拿，你親自去見他好嗎？我們聽得他不在辦公處，是在他自己家內。里奧拿，請求你！』</p>
<p>『好，好，好，』里奧拿念速的同答。他一點也不讀成這主張。不過他當然希望這音樂會　成功。</p>
<p>他到了赫次家，見那位頑固的赫次同他的夫人在午餐，還有一位　麗的密司卡佛。他從談活中知道了她是位歌唱家。赫次推託說另有約會，不能到。但是那位密司卡佛對里奧拿注視着，很同情他的困難，就說她等一會也許可以到音樂會來。</p>
<p>里奧拿懊喪地回到市政廳，走進音樂會時，音樂已經開始。陶麗絲立在台上胆寒地緊握着拳。台下的座位倒沒有一張空的。『卡門』中的一段，她唱得成績煙不壞。好吧，讓她得到成功，她就會滿足了。他耐性地等待她最後的音唱完，最後的一只花籃送到台上，最後的鼓掌聲漸漸停止。然後他到她後台的化裝室去。</p>
<p>後台充滿了談話聲，笑聲，和讃美。頃奧拿擠了過去，看見陶麗絲便把　擁抱了。她高興的問，『怎樣？』</p>
<p>他說道：『孩子，你勝了，眞偉大。我們就這麼離開這裏，去慶賀一下怎樣？』</p>

<p>足球六大錦標、已五項拿到手、名已得、不知利如何、草地網球雙單打賽、眼看又是吾家的天下、</p>
<p>足球巳闌珊、網球又到最後關頭、那　運而生的棒球賽、今天便『開張大吉』、</p>
<p>有話則長、無話卽短、却說棒球在香港、雖比不上足球走紅運、然而、提倡的也不乏人、祇是棒球乃美國的產品、所以在香港不甚發達的原因、就是這個、有心人「曰一體育之道、也看顏色」、</p>
<p>足球看得膩了、今天棒球新上市、正好換一換口味、</p>
<p>開鑼戲、華隊健兒未露臉、而是西洋會打友啤隊、這兩枝兵馬、依我所知、也工力悉敵、</p>
<p>葡軍是去屆亞軍、擁有名將不少、像大告山奴、比路度、帕拉刺、阿路域士等、是足球良材、又是棒球好手、但大告、比路度、刻下南征未歸、旣然人馬不齊，出打頭仗、要仔細些才保得住亞軍聲威、</p>
<p>友碑是雜牌軍、卽去屆義勇軍的化身、有李安納兄弟、實雲等好手、實力相當好、休輕視他們、</p>
<p>會戰地點、在加路連山海軍場、（卽南華會場對下的場所）、棚座已建妥、可容五六百人、現在本港有閒階級多，信得過棒球市道亦旺、</p>
<p>別忘記今日開賽時間、是在下午二時半、明晨十時為去屆盟主中華隊戰美艦岷甸奴、這幕大戰、定多看頭、寄語一般棒球迷，到明晨別要誤卯、　（球場太歲）探悉今天兩隊出戰人馬如下</p>

<h3>草地網球決賽　秩序編定</h3>
<p>公開草地網球賽、經多時之角逐、巳到决賽關頭、得單打决賽權者為徐　培與徐潤培、此一幕乃難兄難弟之戰，但未悉哥哥是否手下留情、得雙打决賽權者、李汝榮何家流對徐氏兄弟，何李組本週與林珍兄弟週旋、以三盤直落、打出冷門、雄心甚熾、現香港木球會、業已編定决賽日時、茲將秩序如下、</p>

<p>張榮才　李國成　梁伯偉　阮樹　謝錦洪　林德譜　劉慶才　陸達鏗　郭英祺　葉北華　陳德　　張金海　揚水益　鄧廣森</p>
<h3>港足球征菲隊　最後勝利　四比一挫YGO隊</h3>
<p>【美聯社四日電】港隊昨夕與此間VGO隊比賽、觀衆八千人、開賽後梁榮照於十分鐘內打進一只，自此雙方各無所獲、上半時一比〇港勝、</p>
<p>下半時開始不久、告山奴打進一只、接着YCO敬還一記、十五分鐘後、告山奴再建功、最後一球、大告又於五分鐘後打進、結果港隊以四比一大勝、李惠堂未出場、（按此電於前晚二時半送到、惟本報因趕版付印、乃不及刊出、今日補登）、</p>
<h3>明日快活谷中演好戲　東方戰澳聯　澳隊明晨乘輪抵步</h3>
<p>值此球事闌珊、埠際隊又遠征未返、明日下午四時半、在香港會場中、却有一場值得欣賞的足球、那是甲組聯賽亞軍東方會迎戰全澳聯隊、</p>
<p>門票分一元、五角、三角、三種、下午三時開門、以免觀衆擁擠、</p>
<p>兩隊陣容、日前曾經公布、旗鼓相當、定是一場惡戰、全澳聯隊由澳門足球總會書記米羅氏親自率頷、準明晨十一時一刻抵步、東方會當予欵待、那上場的陣容是</p>
<p>嘉華路　羅巴度　何佐勝　柯陀華　亞羅殊　蘇沙　小羅比士　亞麥朗　告喇素　李古</p>
<p>後備：劉狄靑、霸打萊戈、</p>
<p>嘉華路有澳門攝鉄手之號、撲救跪接、均有獨　功夫、何佐勝身材好　頭健、脚下快、羅巴度埠際名將、去年來港已顯身手、中堅亞羅殊、亦是名將、有上海之『軋許』風度、踢來得心應手、兩翼衛則以勇猛見稱、前鋒線之告喇素、為最富有危險性、左翼羅比士刁鑽　活、右翼敏捷、中左兩　素有聯絡、蓋此隊進攻時能三角短傳兼施、遠傳兩翼、迅美可觀、近來練習稱勤、東方對之恐不易應付也、</p>
<p>東方會經連日之商榷、排定陣勢如下、</p>
<p>徐亨　劉顯漢　曾仲雲　江善敬　羅偉權　許竟成　劉始讚　於洽興　鄒文治　李德奇　吳祺祥　陳炳土</p>
<p>後備：徐步雲、苗華國、李炳　、</p>
<p>江善敬此番重來、與亨哥及阿牛（仲雲）之聯絡定更進一步、前衛三傑、天衣無縫、進能攻、退能守、而竟成之似攻非攻、不防而猛射的一着、在本場上定能更顯顏色、前鋒綫、右面之將、已搭配慣熱、知彼知已、鄒文治冉為東方效勞、輕車熟路、於洽興近來進步、亦可輔助建攻、胆子放大，會當刮目相視也、</p>
<p>竊以為東方進攻、應以前衛為輔、協助前驅、而退守時、兩內軕亦應　師防禦、突然間奇兵陡出、（此是東方所擅長）、則大功告成矣、</p>
<p>澳門球藝、年來猛進、埠際賽由乙組進而為甲組、而明日之賽亦是澳門球藝水準平衡之一也、</p>
<h3>申報杯籃球義賽　明日下午截止報名</h3>
<p>申報杯女子隊籃球義賽、日前聯會召開會議、决議從速舉辦、當經開始報名、杳日來參加者、極形踴躍、現聯會以屆截止報名時期、定于明（七）日下午六時截止、各隊未報名者、可往中環星島報營業部塡報、</p>
<h3>今夕籃球　甲組鐘聲戰警察　乙組嶺英抗晨光華南戰康元</h3>
<p>公開男子籃球賽、今晚秩序、略有更改、首塲六時半、乙組、嶺英對晨光、二場七時半甲組、鐘聲戰警察、三場八時半乙組、華南戰康元、甲組一役、鐘聲為本屆勁旅、實力異常雄厚、警察略遜一籌、當非其敵、乙組嶺英戰鬥力較晨光强、有取勝可能、南華則應勝康元、</p>

<p>四月廿八日浪苦</p>
<p>凌晨為舟中早餐召食鐘聲所醒、視腕表已指八時、眠雖未飽、亦勉力以興、挽梁君起共朝食、入餐室中、始知舟以卸質、稽時實延至令早六時、始解纜登程也、自小窗觀海、陰雲四佈、小波為虐、浪花拋濺、舟行顛伏、而榮熙均幹、二候、葛尼、比路度諸人、遂倒臥不起、及午、震盪尤甚、曾為平食之兆榮、大告、施漢、亦不能禦、相繼失踪、午晚兩食、惟見余與早如、景祥、天生、阿池、堅金等人、餘均潛　戶內、動彈不得、榮照、榕生且撫胸大吐、暈船之苦、慘逾大病、實則浪本不大、余往來此南中國海凡十四遭、此番實較安靜、惜諸友仍不免嘔吐呻吟之苦、航　之福、余自維得天獨厚、誠幸運兒也、晚食時、美籍役者為余談中國時局甚詳、使余驚訝其所識之深長超卓、自言中國抗戰以遝、最得彼邦勞工界之同情、彼本人除蔣總裁夫婦外、實最崇拜朱德將軍并謂如能堅持到底、最後勝利、屬我無疑、外人尚有此種信念、吾儕尚甘暴棄乎、公理未泯、彼兇殘侵略者、亦可以警矣、晚九時、舟中以有聲電影娛衆、吾隊能享眼福者、數不及半、亦憾事也、</p>
<p>四月廿九目的地</p>
<p>昨日諸人多困于浪、精神萎頓、眠食不足、竊念苟今日仍邋此厄、則明宵比賽『海足』Sea－legs未脫、能逃一敗者幾希、焦念於懷、縈諸夢寐、連余亦輾輾反側、轍宵張目、差幸今早陽光普照、海平如鏡、早起卽見諸友相　離戶、不濟如二侯、榮照、亦整襟共赴飱室、狼吞虎嚥、冀補前失、而領隊阿池、乃喜形于色、聲言飱後赴甲板為飲、以慶全隊之團聚、笑聲繁雜、不復如昨日之廢然無味矣、舟以升帆過　、原定上午抵目的地者、又不得不延至下午四時、接菲總會拍來飛電云、旣與關卡接洽、于舟進港時、卽檢查行李、以省在海關留滯之時刻、五時許、小呂宋已遙遙在望、醫生海關兩小輪、相繼傍舟、循例經過入口檢驗手續、靠岸時已萬家燈火矣、碼頭歡迎者、為數實衆、菲總會幹事依蘭能博士、菲領隊嘉兩禾、港球證奧馬、余好友體育熱心人林光君、菲足球員、中西報記者多人、握手道故、拍電光照多幀畢、乃相率登陸、竊思別後五年、桃花依舊、重來崖護、徒感白髮催人、自民十二年迄今、來岷已前後八遭矣、驅軍赴『淪諾他』酒店、Hatol　Luneta卽忽忽　換戒裝、轉赴球塲一試電燈滋味、場在『萊殺』紀念運動園中、Rizal　Staluim卽前遠運第十屆舉行處、其結構之宏麗、在遠東一帶、惟吾前市中心場可與比擬、塲左設電燈凡四十一、右僅十二、故左明右暗、光線殊不平均、然苟非短視、則球之往未跳躍、必可追隨如意也、練習一小時、卽轉往衰球酒店為食、久未啖中菜、至是腸胃大開、浴身就寢時、不覺籲報午夜矣、（二續</p>
<h3>普及學校體育　應該增設普及班</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（一）鼓勵學生受體育課時的努力、一般學生的過去惡習、對于體育課視為輕閒隨　的課程、體育髁的時間、都是偷懶的機會、因為在其他書本的受課、太拘束了、故此大家的心理、都想在體育課的時間、找一點談笑、自由活動的機會、故在當時的體育敎師、如能够在上課時、隨便的任學生自便的、那就能够投合學生的心理、就是學生最歡迎的一個、若認眞一點時、必給學生們討厭、在有學潮的學校、更要引起學生的風潮、給學生們驅逐一本人在初一離開學生的生活、而担任敎席於某地時、因初到某校、未知某校的風氣、只憑着一片體育革命的熱誠的心情去硬幹、實行强壓體育的手段、分亳也不任由學生自便、遂變成與學生們對頭的人、無論我怎樣的鼓吹、但學生的意氣、終未為我平息、而天天的惡化下去、卒至上書請求核長除本人之職、對本人能課、這件事情、幸而在校長的集會（校長把全校的學生集合於操場訓括、并請本人到場講話）以大無畏的精神、硬幹的手腕、正義的理論、把學生們說服了、事情立刻而平息、以後、上課都能够得到順利、本人經這次事變之後、得到了很多的經騐更把我一切的心理、加强硬化很多、由此而知道學生一般隨便偷懶的意志、必不能固定的、是可以溶化的、可以改正的、祇看為敎師的、自己能不能把自己有理智的見解堅决起來、所以在一般的擊校、如能增股體育普及班時、可以减少很多的麻煩、一方面可以消滅學生對于體育踝輕視的心理、一方面可以鼓勵他對于體育課的努力、——因為他在正課時不努力、可以把他編到普及班去訓練、這時的他、必有一個反應、感覺到自己的體格不及于人、而生出應該以後努力的思想、故此、普及班實在可以勉勵學生努力于受課、同時亦可以消除以往所有一切的惡習、改正過去不良的心理</p>
<p>（二）提高學生家長對于兒童體育訓練之意志、向來中國重文輕武的習慣、文弱之風氣、深入了一般人的　海裏、雖經數十年來之提倡體育、惟至今仍有很多人對于體育是輕視、以讀書人應該要　默靜處、不應該去東跳西跑、常常也會引着『三年不窺園圃』來訓戒子弟、這種的情形、在香港方面更甚、何以見得到呢、這不是我說謊、因為本人自到香港以來、常常接到學生家長寫來的請假信、明明他的兒童是可以受體育訓練、但他偏要借小小的事情來告假、免受體育訓練、以保自己的孩子不必恰日光團着、或其他的　傷等、這邸是杞人憂天、小見而失大的舉動、而中國體育事業之所以會落後、這莫不是一個很大的原因、我們要使他們的心理改正、引導他、而提高他對于體育訓練的意志的話、除了其他的方法之外、而最令他注意的、必是普及班、因為普及班是專為他兒童健康的特殊訓練、正面的表示、是最適合于他兒童所需要的、但側面就可以晤示他說他的兒童　欠缺體育訓練、而致體格太弱了、所以要入該班的訓練、故此、種種部是令他注意的、會給他一個大的刺激、與深刻之反應的、到訓練結果之後、他兒童的體魄都比未受訓時的好了、更可以給他一個徹底的認識、這機的下去漸漸便可以把他們輕視個育訓練的心　轉過來。　（二）</p>

<h3>侵略者的煩惱</h3>
<p>— 澤冽淸著　蔡雲騰譯</p>
<p>日人自認的兩重困難</p>
<p>自中日戰爭陷入長期狀態中，我人（指日本人）心頭卽懸着兩重的不安，第一是國內的經濟問題，第二是國際的關係，而目下英，美，法的聯台壓迫日本，旣成明顯的事實了。</p>
<p>首先試談國內的經濟問題，此問題比任何問題重要，我人僅觀察龐大的國家預算，就能明瞭戰爭是需要如何大量的金錢！</p>
<p>平時日本原料旣非常缺乏，戰爭所使用多量的物質，非更多數仰給外國不可。如汽油，棉花，鐵幾乎要全部依賴外國的輸入。而對外輸入，又非支付現金不可，但日本國庫基金有限，當然要依賴輸出的所得以為輸入的消費，此種辦法對於國家經濟，個人經濟原則上雖說是對的，但這由日貨輸出的所得，却完全是人民勞動的血汗哩。</p>
<p>此次戰爭，不得不向外國購買種種貨物，但是輪出的日貨却很少數，這個理由是因為日貨昂貴，輸出品價格太高，并且外國人多憎惡日本而不購日貨，若以專賴輸出日貨所得的現金來購買外國貨物，不消說是杯水車薪。戰爭拖延下去，無論各種東西非向外購入不可，然後則將繼續支付現金呢？對外借款呢？或是完全不買外貨呢？過去的戰爭，日本尚可向外國借債，這囘此路却不走通了，唯有繼續支付現金一途而已，但支付現金，依今日日本的經濟力看，已經弄到山窮水盡的地步。</p>
<p>一到外邊，隨處都可看到物品的缺乏，公共汽車，野鷄汽車胥被限制，這是汽油缺乏的緣故。因為鐵的飢饉，連街頭的郵筒也改用小型的。綿製品，脫脂綿亦因輸入斷絕而告不足。戰爭意延長，物資是越發枯竭了。</p>
<p>其次——關於國際問題極難樂觀。目前日本助注意的有六個國家，卽德，義。英，法，美，蘇聯等是。這六個國家間，德義兩國是日本的難兄難弟，這是大家所知道的；而英，美，法·蘇聯對日本却採取攻擊，尤其英。美，法三國始終商議對日本制裁的步驟。</p>
<p>日本與蘇聯的漁業問題，蘇聯不答應日本的要求，如果日本眞是硬欲自由出漁，但那邊有潛水艇和飛機，那可不是好玩的。現在日本不信任蘇聯，而蘇聯也不信任日本，所以兩國的感情巳投下一重暗影。但是國際問題是要以事件本質的大小，來加以判斷和解决的。</p>
<p>邇來日本在中國的行動有二點要注意的，第一是日本佔據海南島，海南島距台灣一衣帶水。居香港與新加坡之間，島上物資豐富，將來日本進攻南洋，從戰略上觀察是一個重要的軍事根據地、因此引起了英美法的不安，使他們對于中日戰爭倍加關懷。</p>
<p>第二，是上海租界內暗殺事件不斷發生的問題，上海有兩個租界，一個是公共租界，這租界和四十年前神戶，橫濱的外人居留地相同，一個是法租界，這兩個租界是中國人在滬抗日的大本營。二月間暗殺的事件頻發，二月十九日『維新政府』的傀儡的外長陳籙，二十一日親日派的李國杰等被暗殺在租界裏，中國人這種抗日的現象，無疑的是英美法等國對日惡感的反映，對於此事，日本曾集外務，陸軍，海軍的最高幹部會議，結果向租界要求增加日本警察。</p>
<p>現在最可痛恨的是美國，美國拒絕賣飛機給日本，却肯賣給法，英和蘇聯，并且禁止出賣石油鐵屑給日本的運動也風起雲湧，在太平洋方面擴充軍備尤其是空軍的預算也公佈了。由是觀之，美國對日本的進攻是日益激烈。</p>
<p>英法因遭遇歐洲多事的時候，對日直接壓迫似有困難，轉而以經濟援助中國，美國八千萬圓，英國一千萬圓貸與中國，并且該國飛行員以個人資格來華參加抗戰</p>
<p>究竟英，美，法何以會利害一致呢？他們認為日本獨佔中國，是驅逐他們在華的權益。從前九國公約規定專重中國主權獨立，領土完整，門戶開放，於華盛頓會議時日本亦簽字國之一。但是去年近衛首相，有田外相發表聲明：『遠東的事態，到今日已完全不同，現在日本不能遵守條約』。所以英美法感認日本為破壞條約，相繼提出抗議，抗議的內容大致相同，可見該三國步驟是一致的。</p>
<p>綜上所述，國際對日本的關係已經非常惡劣，但這並非日本一國的問題，而一方面是日本與德意的聯合，一方面是英美法的聯合，為考慮將來第二次世界大戰爆發的問題吧。</p>
<p>所以以中日為中心的世界問題，當需以極冷靜的態度去研究和解决。</p>
<p>春日氤氳着大地，樹梢萌了靑翠以嫩芽，世界人類尚過着違背自然的生活。</p>

<h3>學拉</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>往而不來，非禮也；於是：推而不拉，非利也。而且推，都是防息於未然，去患於既然的消極作用，不像拉，凡是於己有利的都拉，才是十足道地的積極作用。所以拉的對於推。本來等於狼的對於狽，不可分離，而且還有獨立的價值，尤其不可不學！</p>
<p>拉中第一手，自然要算拉人。例知想做官，就要學拉攏，拉攏的子目如：請吃，請逛，請玩，拜老師；攀親家，攀乾親家；認同鄉，認同學，認世誼；送東西；上轅門請安；大老婆，小老婆，姊妹，或任何女人，走內線……每項仔細研究起來，足可成一專書：天下無難事，只怕有心人，此處表過不提。</p>
<p>想發財，就要學拉董事。因為發財之道，最便捷的，除了做官，就要算打公司，開商店，組織工廠，這些門路，只要你能够拉得到有財有聲望的第一等董事，有財無聲望的第二等董事，無財有聲望的第三等董事，他們舉你做經理，開了分公司，分店，分廠，做總經理，你就可以大發其財了，公司等發達，確有贏利，當然你可以大發財；不發達，甚至蝕本，更甚至倒閉，你一樣可以大發達，藍渾水裏撈魚，由來是薪傳秘法、而股東倒完，經理或總經理吃飽，亦一定之公式也。</p>
<p>拉董事之外，自然拉股東也要緊，但是有了上面足以號召的董事，股東也就會聞風響應，不成問題。</p>
<p>如果你說，董事是由股東選舉出來的，如何可以拉，則我要對你說：蠢哉孺子不可敎也，還須力學才是！蓋選舉是具文，拉是實！</p>
<p>最近，發財之道，除了開公司等以外，有種人異想天開，以為開學校的出息也很不差，因此關於開學校的拉，也不能不努力一學。</p>
<p>第一，也要會拉董事；董事的資格正和公司等有的一樣。第二，要會拉敎員：能够叫座，吸得牢學生的紅敎員要拉，能够苦刻耐勞，惠而不費，帮我發財而又潔己奉公，不思染指的黑敎員尤其要拉。第三，要會拉學生；來者不拒，多多益善為宗旨；敝校三十六門，門門俱全，適應學生種種需要為號召；或登報或貼招子，或發傳單，甚至或請跑街，或用掮客為手段</p>
<p>據說，校長是文化界領袖，在我們這個右文之國，名譽比了經理或總經理要好總些，發財則全少和經理或總經理差不多，似乎在名利雙收這一點上，校長之拉，比了經理或總經理之拉，尤其要學得精明才是。</p>
<p>拉中第二手，也許要算拉功了吧。這一拉，正和推相反。</p>
<p>小而言之：和人家　足球，贏了回來，嚣嚣然號於衆日：幸虧我那一脚，奠定了江山：老兄撒屎不帶草紙，若非我身有廢紙，方便為門，賙濟於你，你就立不起身來——　至燒湯的保兒，也會來上一齣『丑表功』，大而言之：下級小職員，以及工人出身，辛苦奮鬥，不遺餘力，一朝發財，分起紅利來，按十七股開拆，所得為一股的幾分之幾，而經理或總經理，則得獨幾股；白袍小將火頭軍，攻城略地，新將奉旗，一概由張士貫上在狗壻何宗憲的賬上；……甚全堂堂一國的元首，以壓榨國民為常事，以欺侮弱小為能事，而發表演說時，則自稱為國民的救主，和平的保護神。總之，『一切倒霉，吃虧，受損失的壞事，都推在別人身上，』而一切順利，繁華，增高名譽，地位，以及收入的好事，都拉在自己身上。</p>
<p>一拉再拉，似乎還須『三拉』才會『團圓。』然而要學三拉，實在還太多，旣不止三拉，也就越出了團圓的圈兒外，現在只好略提畿種以成蛇足。</p>
<p>有村稿當編輯的人，不能不學會這一手：稿荒會有稿，稿劣會有佳稿。大概沒有錢時，只有打躬作揖，巧取豪奪；有錢時，則挹彼注此，或薄彼厚此。彼者，後生小子，美其名曰新進作家；此者，老　文匠，美名曰文壇先進。</p>
<p>有拉檯子，在上海灘上走走的人，不能不學這一手；——</p>
<p>有拉客，常妓女的人——</p>
<p>罷了、再拉下去，就要拉得不成樣子了。就此打住，不再拉。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『我們現在對你不好嗎？』</p>
<p>『昨天晚上呢？』她抽搐着鼻尖，沉痛地問：『你對我怎樣，你忘了嗎？』</p>
<p>『我沒忘，一生都記得，一定肥得很牢。不過，我告訴你，你不該袒護你的父親，你不該以私情忘了公憤！昨天晚上的事情，我們一方面為了打擊你的父親，不是你，一方面也為了我們工作的必要，就是錢。你是無辜的，我們知道。我說的話，你明白嗎？』</p>
<p>『我明白，所以我現在站在我父親和你們二者的中間說話！』</p>
<p>『昨天的晚上呢？』</p>
<p>『昨天的晚上——已經過去啦！』</p>
<p>『明天呢？』</p>
<p>『明天還沒來，沒來的，我不知道！』她隨着誠意地要求他：『你說我明天呢？』</p>
<p>『我說你明天——』他想想以後，非常嚴肅地告訴她；『明天，你可以上天常，也可以下地獄！』</p>
<p>『天堂，地獄？』　（五八）</p>
<h3>蘆葦叢中</h3>
<p>— 思方</p>
<p>趙家渡一夜</p>
<p>趙家渡，黃浦江下一個荒凉的小渡口，隱伏在蘆葦叢裏，船隻很少在這裏碇泊，鎭日的靜寂得可怕，風吹着蘆葦，蕭　地在響。</p>
<p>現在是晚上了，黃浦江的夕潮，拍擊着　岸，呼嘛聲像凄厲的哀哭。蘆葦叢給埋葬在濃濃的夜色裏，灣着牠們的頭，夜風打着嗚咽的調子吹過來，那些頭向左向右的擺動着。</p>
<p>在黝黑的天空裏，掛着像死人面孔一樣慘白的月亮，灑下來的淡白的光，更慘愁而哀怨。</p>
<p>突然，蘆葦叢中發出着悉素的聲響，還有脚步在淺水喪移動的孔孔的水聲，同時輕微的低語聲，混和着鳴咽的風聲，高一陣低一陣的聽不淸楚。</p>
<p>半個鐘頭以後，什麼聲音都沒有了，祇有江水壓着沈重的嗓音在吶喊着，一大團一大團的泡沫。打着漩渦。衝到　邊。滾入蘆葦叢中。</p>
<p>月亮給一團烏雲遮住了，沒有一絲微光，四下裏完全像漆一般的黑。</p>
<p>蘆葦叢中，有非常輕微的，但是很急促的呼吸聲透露出來。</p>
<p>黃浦江的吶喊的夕湖聲中，有木槳潑水的聲音，曄啦嘩啦的響着。</p>
<p>有一隻小船從對岸很迅捷的搖過來。</p>
<p>從墨黑的夜色中，可以隱約地看到船上坐着五六個穿着黃衣服的人，身上全背着槍，睜大着如鷹隼一般的眼睛，貧婪地看着漆黑的夜空。有幾個在愉快地打着口哨，有時候發出高聲的笑語。</p>
<p>——搖得快一點！</p>
<p>一陣么喝聲像急雷一般的在寂靜的夜空裏爆散開來，於是木槳的潑水聲更急促，船也行得更快了。</p>
<p>蘆葦叢中，輕輕的有一陳騷動，有脚步在水聲喪栘動。</p>
<p>——快！預備好！赤老的船搖近了。</p>
<p>有一聲低沈的命令，繼着是相亙間的低語聲之後，又什麼都靜靜的了，只有夜風的嗚咽聲，潮水的拍岸聲，和中流木槳打水的聲音，像合奏着抑鬱的交響樂。</p>
<p>——砰——</p>
<p>第一響聲從蘆葦叢中響了出來，繼着一連串的槍聲響起來了。彈流朝着小船的方向射過來，像疾雨裏夾帶着堅硬的冰雹，一股子濃烟從蘆葦叢中湧了出來，火光閃耀在黑暗的夜空裏。</p>
<p>等黃衣人從鷩愕中跳起來，提起槍對準的時候，倒在船頭上了，鮮紅的從血船頭上汨汨地流到江中。不盡的彈述從蘆葦叢中射出來，船上的扮彈也無目地向蘆葦霧中射進去。</p>
<p>靜寂的趙家渡現在是熱鬧了，子彈像瘋狂一般的在空中的飛　着，蘆華叢中的喊聲，像從幾千支喉嚨裏發出來的怒吼聲：火光紅了半個天。</p>
<p>一個鐘頭以後，狂暴的槍聲過去了，火光亦消滅了，火藥臭血腥氣，混雜着　浮在寗靜的空氣中。</p>
<p>黃浦江上一隻小船翻了身，幾個屍體隨了波浪翻滾着，黃濁的流水中混着鮮紅的血。</p>
<p>蘆葦叢中也有鮮紅的血流到江中，有幾個人在發出協痛的呻吟聲，可是給雄壯的叫喊聲和歡歌聲遮沒了。</p>
<p>這時候天已黎明了，晨光射到茂密的蘆葦叢中。</p>
<h3>世紀底新生</h3>
<p>— 石風</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>末日</p>
<p>來臨吧；</p>

<h3>Resistance War, Economic Construction, and Land Problems: Full Text of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society and Its Resolutions</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society was held at the Chuandong Normal School Auditorium on April 23rd and 24th.</p>
<p>This annual meeting coincided with the period when the war of resistance was about to enter a new stage. It had been a full two years since the Fourth Annual Meeting held in Qingdao in April of the 26th year of the Republic. In these two years, China had made new progress and was absolutely different compared to then. An obvious fact is that the meeting address today is in the wartime capital – Chongqing!</p>
<p>Due to the separation of the war zones and the interruption of transportation, the participation of the members was affected, but in fact, the number of people attending this time reached more than eighty, exceeding the Fourth Annual Meeting. This shows the attention of land administration scholars to land issues. Naturally, the concentration of most members in Chongqing is also a reason.</p>
<p>Outline of the Venue</p>
<p>The conference opened on the 23rd morning with 82 attendees. There were personnel actually handling land administration, from the Land Committee of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, the Land Department of the Ministry of the Interior, to the land administration bureaus of various provinces and cities, and reclamation zone personnel. Most of them participated. Another part was the president, professors, and scholars studying land administration issues from the Land Administration College of the Central Political School of the Kuomintang. Guests included representatives from the Land Administration Academy of the Ministry of the Interior, the Survey Bureau of the Ordnance General Headquarters, the Shandong Provincial Land Administration Bureau, the Guizhou Finance Department, the Shaanxi Civil Affairs Department, and the Sichuan Land Bureau, as well as all 20+ students of the eighth class of the Land Administration College.</p>
<p>The seats in the venue were arranged in rows, and members were seated according to their numbers. Each person carefully read the mimeographed proposal summary, the agenda, and documents such as local land administration implementation reports and reclamation zone status. The front rows were occupied by figures such as the council of the association and the annual meeting organizing committee. Two points from Chairman Chiang's instructions, "The solution of the land problem is the primary urgent task of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood" and "The day of victory in the War of Resistance will be a good opportunity to thoroughly promote land policy," were written into a couplet-style quotation and hung in the center of the auditorium.</p>
<p>A Heated Debate</p>
<p>The most heated scene of this meeting was the debate on land administration issues during and after the war at the first general meeting on the 23rd afternoon, chaired by Zheng Zhen, Director of the Land Department of the Ministry of the Interior. The topic of discussion was "China's Post-War Land Policy," which was formulated by the council before the meeting. According to the Secretary-General's report, the number of attendees was 59.</p>
<p>After the chairman announced the topic, he invited everyone to speak freely. Originally, it was planned that the council would decide on the discussion items to give the members a scope for discussion. But due to time constraints, only Mr. Huang Tong explained, "The proposal of the post-war land policy may be questioned by the public; why not discuss the wartime but discuss the post-war?" Then Mr. Huang explained, "The victory of the War of Resistance is predictable, and the state will undergo such a major change. The future social situation and system will inevitably be chaotic, so we discuss the post-war land policy in preparation for the government's adoption in the future."</p>
<p>The proposal of this question immediately aroused a discussion on "timing." Everyone stood up to speak, arguing about the topic. "How long will the war last?" "What will the situation be after the war?" "The situation after the war is unclear, how can we determine the post-war policy?" "Moreover, we cannot compare the post-war with the pre-war." Those who disagreed with discussing "post-war" repeatedly raised these questions. Their active advocacy was that "wartime" land problems are practical problems, and we cannot avoid reality to discuss the idealistic "post-war," and today's land problems are urgently awaiting solutions. Some interpreted "post-war" as "after the War of Resistance," and some proposed that at the very least, "wartime" and "post-war" should be discussed together. Those who advocated discussing "post-war" used "preparing for post-war" as a reason, and could also make "estimated" discussions on "post-war." The chairman's opinion was that because the topic was decided by the council, it should be discussed accordingly, and the discussion could also link "wartime" and "post-war" together to avoid only arguing about the topic without getting to the point. Finally, as the time was almost past 2 o'clock, and more than twenty people had expressed their opinions on this issue, they had to continue the discussion. However, in everyone's subsequent speeches, they repeatedly mentioned the topic first, and the discussion did not reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>Land Problems in Southwest Construction</p>
<p>At the second general meeting on the 24th morning, the attendees were still 59 people. What was discussed was "Southwest Economic Construction and Land Problems." This is a newly emerging problem in the rear of the War of Resistance. The most important issues were "requisition" and "compensation." How to solve the requisition of land for roads and the like? How to compensate for the requisition of land? The other issues were land use, labor, taxation, land price speculation, and lack of social stability.</p>
<p>However, when each person expressed their opinions, they mostly talked about Southwest construction, and there was less precise discussion about land problems. Therefore, when the time was almost up, Mr. Luo Xingjian gave a general summary, which mainly meant that in addition to the government having a unified plan for Southwest construction and land problems, a central land administration agency should be set up immediately to promote and solve the problems that have already occurred and will occur in accordance with land laws and regulations.</p>
<p>At the third general meeting, important proposals and resolutions, as well as telegrams, were passed.</p>
<p>In summary, in this annual meeting, apart from the heated debate on "wartime" and "post-war" at the first general meeting, there was little concrete and in-depth discussion, only a general outline was discussed, and it was largely concluded.</p>
<p>The Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society was held at 8:00 AM on April 24th after the Premier's Memorial Week, and continued to hold the second meeting. First, President Kong's congratulatory speech to the General Assembly was read out, and then the Western Economic Construction and Land Issues were discussed until 12:00. At 2:00 p.m., the third meeting continued to be held, and the Proposals Committee first reported the results of the review, and five proposals were put forward for discussion: (1) Suggest that the government actively implement the "land to the tiller" policy to increase production, stabilize agriculture, and enrich national strength; (2) Land reclamation during extraordinary periods should be organized by land administration agencies; (3) Propose that the central government promptly establish land administration agencies in order to promote wartime and post-war land policies; (4) Propose that the central government delineate the second district of northern Shaanxi as the experimental zone for the Party's equalization of land rights; (5) Draft temporary measures for reducing and exempting land rent in war zones and remedying land abandonment and land abandonment, etc. All five proposals were passed in accordance with the results of the review. The Committee on Membership Review reported that they were extremely satisfied with the past work of the Association, and then discussed the revision of the Constitution. A temporary motion was passed by the General Assembly to send a telegram to the Kuomintang President Chiang and the front-line soldiers to pay tribute. Finally, Su Gan, Zeng Ji-kuan, Zheng Zhen-yu, Wan Guoding, Zhu Ban, Huai Fansun, Huang Tong, Li Ailing, Zhang Tingxiu Baode, Gao Xin, Tang Qiyu, Liu Xiuqing, Guan Jiyu, Guo Hanming and other fifteen people were elected as council members, Zhou Zhizuo, Luo Xiatian, Lin Qinchen, Wang Xianqiang, Zhu Zongliang, Jiang Lian, Feng Zigang, Luo Meixing, Li Ruhan and nine others were elected as alternate directors. The meeting closed at about 7:00, and the two resolutions passed by the association on "China's Post-War Land Policy" and "Southwest Economic Construction and Land Problems" are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>China's Post-War Land Policy</h3>
<p>Regarding the guiding principles and program guidelines of our country's land policy, the Premier's legacy has long been proclaimed, and the past annual meetings of this association have also had considerable concrete resolutions to follow. Now, in order to complete national freedom and national independence, we are fighting the war, and the construction of a Three People's Principles country should be accelerated, and the essence of equalizing land rights lies in implementing a peaceful social revolution at the time of the new construction after the great destruction. When the national government was established in the 16th year of the Republic, because the advance planning was not solid, we missed the opportunity, so on the day of victory in the war, we should immediately implement the policies proclaimed in the Premier's legacy in accordance with the pre-determined plan to establish a new land system based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and its essentials are as follows:</p>
<p>1. After the war, the country should immediately promulgate emergency laws to reorganize land rights. In areas destroyed by the war, in particular, effective methods should be used to adjust the distribution of people and land and restore the prosperity of rural areas. Therefore, (1) in areas where the tenant farming system is prevalent, land financial institutions should be used after the war to adjust land rights in order to realize that the tiller owns the land. (2) In places where people have been displaced due to the war and the land is barren, all ownerless land should be used to transfer it to the tiller. (3) In coastal and riverside provinces and counties with dense populations and fragmented land rights, a land needs registry should be established after the war to determine the amount of people and land and adjust the distribution of width and narrowness. (4) In provinces and counties in border areas with a sparse population, large-scale relocation work should be carried out after the war, and large-scale farming should be tried. (5) Before active construction, progressive land value tax and value-added tax should be implemented immediately to prevent monopoly and to make the benefits of construction public. (6) Land requisitioned from the people due to the war should be fully compensated after the war, or compensated with other land. (7) For people who have been displaced by the war and have returned to their homeland, all land taxes not paid during the war and land not paid by tenant farmers shall be exempted.</p>
<p>2. At the beginning of post-war economic construction, land consolidation work should be actively promoted in industrial areas, transportation centers, and seaports and cities. In particular, land prices should be determined first and laws on the return of price increases to the public should be promulgated. Therefore, (1) If the original state of land and its fixed objects has changed due to the war, arbitrarily restoring the original state should be prohibited in accordance with construction plans. (2) In major construction areas, the land required in the plan should be requisitioned in advance before the plan is announced. (3) For war-torn and emerging cities, urban plans and zoning methods should be predetermined, and land price declarations should be held before land surveying and registration are completed.</p>
<p>3. Post-war land use should seek to suit the trend of modern economic development, and pay attention to rational agricultural management. Especially in areas where the destruction by the invaders is more serious, the cultivated land should be rebuilt at the beginning of the recovery, and standard self-cultivating farmers should be established to ensure that the displaced and suffering farmers have sufficient livelihood guarantees. Therefore, (1) in areas where land management is too subdivided, reorganization should be carried out quickly and cooperative management should be promoted. (2) If there are too few self-cultivating farms, they should be quickly adjusted after the war to give them an appropriate amount of land and allow them to meet ideal standards. (3) Natural resources and land with unique properties should be developed by national capital after the war, and attention should be paid to local preservation.</p>
<p>4. At the time of post-war demobilization, the state should give preferential compensation to all officers and soldiers who have contributed to the country and participated in the war, and grant them land for self-cultivation. Families of the wounded and killed and displaced victims should also be given an appropriate amount of land to show condolences. Therefore, (1) requisition the land of absentee landlords, or give priority to allocating public land to soldiers who are willing to return to agriculture. (2) Families of those killed or injured in the war and displaced victims, even if they have no farming ability, should also be given land, especially allowing them to rent it out or hire workers for a certain period of time. (3) In important border defense areas, elite troops and their families should be relocated to carry out military reclamation.</p>
<p>5. In order to implement the above four items, the improvement and establishment of post-war land administration institutions, the widespread promotion of land registration, and the training of land administration personnel are all urgent matters that should be prepared in advance. Therefore, (1) the central government and the provinces and counties should quickly expand the functions of land administration agencies, enrich their content, and establish land administration agencies in the occupied provinces at the beginning of the recovery to implement land management. (2) If there are no maps or the maps have been lost in the occupied areas, they should be reorganized at the beginning of the recovery, and land registration should be carried out in the rear provinces before economic construction begins. (3) Land administration personnel should be divided into three levels: high, middle, and junior, and separate and large-scale training should be carried out immediately.</p>
<h3>Southwest Economic Construction and Land Problems</h3>
<p>At this time when the War of Resistance is proceeding smoothly, in order to increase the strength of the War of Resistance and establish a foundation for national construction, the central government should first determine the entire plan for economic construction. Southwest economic construction is the initial stage of the entire construction, and its construction plan should occupy an extremely important position in the national economic construction plan. Land is the basic element of all economic construction. Therefore, when implementing South Economic Construction, we should have a meticulous plan and concrete methods for land issues in advance to establish the foundation of economic construction, so that the construction work can proceed smoothly and the national economy can develop in a healthy manner. The following are the land issues that should be paid attention to and the solutions in the progress of South Economic Construction:</p>
<p>1. Land requisitioned for economic construction should be carefully considered and compensated separately according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>2. In the central area of economic construction and the new cities and towns along the land and water transportation lines, land prices should be determined first. All land price increases due to the implementation of economic construction should be used to replenish the funds for economic construction.</p>
<p>3. In the wasteland in the southwestern economic construction area, those suitable for large-scale reclamation should be operated by public farms organized by the government; other wasteland should be encouraged to be reclaimed separately by private individuals or groups in order to increase the material resources for the War of Resistance and enrich the strength of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>4. The agricultural, forestry, pastoral, and mining lands in this area should be zoned according to the natural environment and social conditions, and used separately in order to seek the adjustment of land use and avoid the loss of land fertility; as for the emerging cities and towns of economic construction. Detailed estimates should be made in advance so that the land can be used appropriately and the deformed development can be avoided.</p>
<p>5. In the land system in the reclamation area, efforts should be made to improve it in accordance with the principles of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and self-cultivating farms should be actively established at the same time.</p>
<p>6. In order to enrich the economic construction resources and activate the financial resources of economic construction, land and agricultural financial institutions should be established so that the construction work can be easily developed</p>
<p>7. All economic construction is based on land surveying. The government should plan and continue to manage all construction land surveying work in this area.</p>
<p>8. In order to unify the progress of land administration work in the southwestern economic construction area, a special management department should be established first to be responsible for planning and implementing it effectively.</p>
<h3>Balancing Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>Although everyone feels that prices are terribly high, everyone thinks this is a normal phenomenon of war. Indeed, this is the case, and it is the same both in China and abroad. Everyone grits their teeth and endures this as a normal phenomenon of wartime. This is sufficient to reflect the firm and unyielding spirit of sacrifice of the entire nation, which is worthy of pride to the world.</p>
<p>However, we must not let it go unchecked simply because it is an inevitable trend, because many people are using this reason to manipulate prices and deliberately raise them. For the overall benefit of the nation and the people, everyone should have the spirit of sacrificing everything. However, in fact, we cannot deny that there is a limit to the endurance of material life. At the same time, it should be considered that when the people's lives are oppressed by high prices to the point where they cannot sustain themselves, it will not help the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding this issue, rather than saying that "there is an urgent need for a practical solution at present," it is better to say that "for the sake of future safety, it is necessary to plan ahead to prevent problems before they arise." Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is known to be related to the war, then in the future when there is no hope of ending the war, and when all the causes that stimulate soaring prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited boiling. However, there is no doubt that:</p>
<p>(2) Analysis of the Reasons for High Prices</p>
<p>Why does the existence of war sufficiently stimulate soaring prices? The reason is very simple. Let's take the current situation as an example.</p>
<p>(1) Before the war, the country's expenses were at most about 800 to 900 million yuan. Even the total budget for the 26th year of the Republic of China, which set an unprecedented high record, was only a little over 1 billion yuan. But since the outbreak of the war, due to the rapid increase in military spending, it is said to have exceeded 1.5 billion yuan. This means that the demand for goods has almost more than doubled compared to peacetime. When demand increases, prices will naturally increase. Shanghai, for example, has also seen a sharp increase in population, which has greatly increased demand. However, this is not the main factor, because:</p>
<p>(2) If production can increase at the same rate as the increase in demand, then the rise in prices can still proceed along a gentle curve, and will not rise higher and higher. However, our production industry was already so backward in peacetime, and it has been damaged beyond recognition during the war. Not only is the industrial equipment dilapidated, but also the vast number of farmers in the war zones have stopped farming. In addition, the looting by the Japanese army everywhere has further increased the consumption of materials and expanded the imbalance between supply and demand.</p>
<p>(3) With the drastic reduction in domestic production, plus the looting by the Japanese, our country's export capacity has been greatly reduced. A decrease in exports affects the balance of international payments. In addition, most of our military and civilian supplies rely on overseas, so the value of the currency itself is threatened. Moreover, the Japanese are doing their best to disrupt our country's foreign exchange. Since the emergence of the foreign exchange market, the value of the currency has fallen by about 60-70%. When the value of the currency falls, the price of imported goods will inevitably rise even more sharply. Therefore, the monetary burden on the government and the people to purchase foreign goods is even greater. The amount of currency in circulation domestically must naturally increase.</p>
<p>(4) When the amount of currency in circulation increases, if the circulation of goods is smooth, then the extent to which the currency stimulates prices can still be reduced through the increase in the transaction rate. However, the transportation lines in the war zone are all controlled by the Japanese, and even if freight relies on foreign merchants, it cannot be handled with ease. Therefore, the situation of supply and demand imbalance is even more serious, and the force of price increases is even stronger.</p>
<p>(5) In the process of commodity circulation, in addition to the difficulty of freight transport, there are many other obstacles. The Japanese puppets extort money along the way in the war zone, and now they are promoting their so-called "trade system." In addition, increases in freight, insurance, and domestic remittance rates are all strengthening the extent of the supply and demand imbalance and price increases.</p>
<p>These many pressures that stimulate prices are all products of war. As long as the war exists for one day, there will be the possibility of rising for one day. We can offset the suffering of these high prices caused by the war with the harvest of ultimate victory. However, in addition to these natural reasons, there are also phenomena such as speculation, hoarding, monopolies, and cornering the market. Moreover, these phenomena have a more fierce impact on prices. It is indeed impossible to calculate the proportion of speculative prices in the prices of various goods. However, we can just give an example to prove the extent to which they occupy the current price level.</p>
<p>(3) Speculative Prices at Price Levels</p>
<p>For example, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of rice stored in warehouses in Shanghai did not actually decrease. In terms of the rice market season, this is the weakest period for rice prices throughout the year. However, this time it was contrary to the usual practice, and it suddenly began to rise sharply. The reason for the soaring prices was said to be that the Japanese army was buying up rice, so there was a risk of rice shortage in Shanghai, and everyone competed to hoard and purchase rice. It is certainly permissible to purchase rice to prevent shortages, but it is questionable why the rice price stopped rising after reaching the limit of 14 yuan. If there is really a risk of rice shortage, even under strong control, there will be a black market, just like the black market that occurred during the rice shortage last spring. Moreover, after the rice price rose to 14 yuan, why did the Japanese army no longer continue to buy it? If they said it was too expensive and would be at a loss to buy it, the Japanese army does not pay market prices when buying anything. Whether it is expensive or not is not related to whether or not they buy it. Later, it was heard that this rice price boom can be regarded as a grievance of the Shanghai rice merchants. Because now, except for the price of rice, which is still the same as before the war, other commodities have risen sharply.</p>
<p>One of the internal factors of the current high prices is the foreign exchange relationship. The price of rice is not affected by this, because it is a local product. However, cotton is also a local product. Why can't it be as stable as the price of rice? If it is said that it is for need, then the need for cotton is not necessarily greater than that for rice. If it is said that it is because of the control and harsh taxes of the Japanese puppets, rice has also been treated the same way. However, the current market price of cotton has risen by more than 50% compared to the average price in the six months before the war. The main reason for the rise in cotton prices, in addition to the actual reasons such as supply and demand, is that it is actually driven by the soaring yarn prices. Looking at January to April last year, yarn prices were constantly rising, while cotton prices showed alternating ups and downs. Therefore, the average yarn price for the whole year last year increased by 32.3% compared to January to August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, while the cotton price fell by 2.1%. In January of this year, the yarn price increased by 52.9% compared to the average of the eight months before the war, and the cotton price also rose to 44%. (See Table 6 of the January issue of the Economic Statistics Monthly)</p>
<p>Why did yarn prices rise so sharply? Of course, it is related to the many reasons mentioned above, but the speculative component is even more relevant. Although many figures can be presented to prove the reduction in production and the destruction of production equipment, Shanghai is, after all, the place of origin of cotton yarn, and the supply is always easier than in other places. There is no reason in circulation for yarn prices to rise sharply. Moreover, it is a domestic product, and there is no currency impact. Shanghai yarn prices have a dominant position in national yarn prices. If its prices are indeed reasonable, then it cannot arbitrarily set high prices for sale by taking advantage of the needs of the interior. But it is because yarn prices in the interior are surprisingly high, that yarn prices in Shanghai are also raised as much as possible, so that the situation of getting more and more expensive has been created today. It should be known that taking advantage of needs to set high prices for sale is precisely one of the tricks of speculative manipulation.</p>
<p>We may as well compare it from other places. The rise in prices in Shanghai is actually more severe than in the interior. Due to material limitations, let's compare July of the 26th year of the Republic of China and August of the 27th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Comparison of Price Indices between Shanghai and the Interior (Average price for the whole year of 1937 as the base period)</p>
<p>(Note) The base period for Shanghai and Guangzhou was originally 1926. It has been recalculated to use the average price for the whole year of 1937 as the base period, so that it can be compared with the Chongqing index, which is based on 1937. For materials, see the China and Foreign Economic Yearbook published by the China National Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>Shanghai had already experienced war in the 26th year of the Republic of China. At that time, Guangdong and Sichuan were in the rear. Taking the average price for the whole year as the base period, the increase rate in Shanghai should theoretically be lower than that in the interior when comparing it with subsequent prices, but it is actually the opposite. The price of Shanghai in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China, when it had changed from the front line to the rear, rose more sharply than that in the interior. The reason that Shanghai prices are based on the high prices in the interior is obviously untenable, and it proves that the degree of speculation in Shanghai is far more harmful than in other places.</p>
<p>(4) High Prices and Wartime Economy</p>
<p>Generally speaking, prices and the people's purchasing power are mutually causal. When prices rise, the people's income increases, and therefore the people's purchasing power also increases. If prices rise above the level of the people's purchasing power, the people's consumption will naturally decrease, and therefore prices will inevitably fall accordingly until they are equal to the people's purchasing power. However, this is conditional on developed production and stable order, and in fact it cannot be fully realized, because wages will never rise in the same proportion as prices. Therefore, high prices only weaken the people's purchasing power, and there is very little possibility of enhancing the people's purchasing power. Looking at the table below, the average wage of factory workers in Shanghai increased by only 1.8% in the 27th year compared to the 26th year. However, the living expenses of workers at this time had already increased by 29.4%. This is an obvious fact.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Living Expenses and Wage Indices of Shanghai Workers</p>
<p>26th Year</p>
<p>27th Year</p>
<p>Living Expenses Index of Workers (3) 124.11 160.60</p>
<p>Wage Index of Factory Workers (2) 100.00 101.80</p>
<p>Purchasing Power of Currency (1) 80.57 62.27</p>
<p>(Note 1) Figures are based on the figures compiled by the China Branch of the International Labour Office.</p>
<p>(2) The wage index is calculated based on the "Monthly Average Wage Table of Shanghai Factory Workers" in the "Economic Statistics Monthly" published by the Economic Statistics Research Institute, January issue of this year. Moreover, our country's production is extremely backward, and now it is in a period of war that is destroying all production equipment. Therefore, the rise in prices on the one hand reflects the sharp decline in the external value of the currency, and on the other hand strengthens the power of foreign goods to exploit our national wealth. In other words, it is sufficient to promote the collapse of our country's finances, currency system, and the entire national economy.</p>
<p>On the surface, the income of comprador capital (merchants who specialize in selling foreign goods) and quasi-comprador capital (such as producers who use foreign raw materials and their product distributors, etc.) may also increase to some extent. From this, it creates a superficial prosperity in bank loan accounts. However, it can neither compensate for the loss of the monetary value of wealth and capital, nor can it compensate for the loss of the entire national wealth. That is obvious.</p>
<p>In fact, the rise in domestic prices has now made the entire nation feel the harsh threat to their lives. If this threat is not eliminated, or even expands, the result will be a danger of shaking the entire social order. What is even more dangerous is that it will directly shake the economic foundation of the war. Recently, the British loan to China to help balance foreign exchange, if we do not talk about political significance and analyze its economic significance, then everyone knows that it is "to maintain its commodity market for exports to China." In other words, it is only because China's prices have already exceeded the purchasing power level of the general public, making their commodity market in China face another major obstacle in addition to the violent obstruction of the Japanese. Balancing China's exchange rate is to prevent the continued rise in import prices in China. Moreover, the reason why we attach importance to this issue is not so much because of the current necessity, but rather because of the future, and we must plan ahead to prevent problems before they arise. Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is the impact of the war. Then, in the future when there is no hope of ending the war, that is, in the future when all the causes that stimulate soaring prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited boiling.</p>
<p>(5) The National Government's Countermeasures to Balance Prices</p>
<p>The National Government has long had the determination to control wartime prices. However, such control has not yet been successfully tested in European countries with highly organized economies. Germany's "appropriate price system," although praised by the world, has no room for imitation in China, whose economic organization is like a plate of loose sand. However, in fact, it is no longer allowed to let it go on like this for a long time, and if the speculative factors in prices can be eliminated, it can balance a lot. As long as all industries can have a clear conscience, the problem can be solved easily. Therefore, recently, it finally ordered the provincial and municipal governments to organize price-balancing committees in cooperation with provincial banks and local banks to implement balancing the prices of daily necessities for the people, and stipulated three standards for fair prices:</p>
<p>(1) For goods whose production and transportation costs have not been affected by the war or have been affected very little, the average price of one year or one year before the war shall be used as the standard.</p>
<p>(2) For goods whose production and transportation costs have been affected by the war, their costs after the war plus a considerable profit shall be used as the standard.</p>
<p>(3) For goods whose costs cannot be calculated, the total amount of capital required for their operation, plus a considerable profit, shall be used as the standard. It is also stipulated that the goods for balancing prices shall be limited to daily necessities.</p>
<p>The price-balancing committee is organized jointly by the local government, the provincial bank or local bank, and the commercial associations and guilds. Any factory, merchant, or private individual may report it to the court in accordance with the regulations on the administration of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce.</p>
<p>(1) The quantity of mutual buying and selling between the same industry shall not exceed the current quantity of inventory.</p>
<p>(2) Industries that do not operate daily necessities shall not buy and sell futures on the market with each other.</p>
<p>(3) The buying and selling of daily necessities shall not attempt to establish an exchange market.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai, which still occupies an important position in the national economy and is the place where speculation is the most rampant and prices are rising the fastest, has unfortunately been surrounded in the occupied area. Political power cannot play an active role. It is simply impossible to proceed if the people come out for self-government. Therefore, whether the citizens of Shanghai can be relieved of undue exploitation and harsh oppression in prices depends only on whether the leaders of all industries can use their efforts to support this point.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Poland's Precarious Situation and England</h3>
<p>Recent changes in Eastern Europe have brought us back to the situation before the fall of Czechoslovakia. The "Daily Mail" recently reported that Hitler had made several demands on Poland, with a deadline of fourteen days for a response. The main points of his demands are (1) ceding Danzig to Germany, (2) allowing Germany to build a military road from the German border through the Polish Corridor to reach East Prussia; (3) designating the area along the way as a special zone where Germans can enjoy extraterritoriality. This is tantamount to preparing to dismember Poland on the one hand, and stabbing Poland's heart with a sharp knife on the other. At the same time, in the past few days, Germany has also launched a propaganda campaign to desperately attack Poland, and falsely accused Poland of conspiring to annex East Prussia (a certain newspaper in Hamburg). Major cities on the German-Polish border have also mobilized large numbers of troops, preparing for action. When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, it used this tactic. No one dares to believe that Hitler will not relive his old dream, his sweet old dream.</p>
<p>People in Europe and the United States are very worried about Hitler's active advance into Eastern Europe. The speculations about his past atrocities have unfortunately been confirmed. Recently, the American "Intelligence Magazine" also speculated that the Axis countries will have a series of actions in mid-May. Democratic countries are also forced to respond with a tough attitude. The result is either the Axis countries retreat, or a world war breaks out. This prediction of a major turmoil in mid-May may refer to Hitler's attack on Poland. The situation Poland is in now is exactly the same as that of Czechoslovakia before it was dismembered and even annexed.</p>
<p>This situation is certainly tense and dangerous in Poland, but the democratic countries of England and France cannot take it lightly, because the beginning of this turmoil will not be able to achieve a temporary stability as it did after the fall of Czechoslovakia; or it will lead to even bigger incidents one after another. As revealed in an essay by William, a writer for "Greenwich Times": "The German General Staff has prepared a plan to send troops to land on the south coast of England and Wales Island unexpectedly." "Hitler also believes that if German troops can land on these two islands, they can conquer England in no more than four months of combat." Hitler's artillery is now aimed at England's chest. At the same time, Poland has learned from the pain of the fall of Czechoslovakia and is prepared to resist. Poland is also different from Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia only had the guarantees of England and France at the time, while Poland today has close relations with the Soviet Union. The peace front in Eastern Europe has also taken the lead in developing a fairly sound foundation. If Hitler does not act, it is fine, but if he acts, the development of the situation will not be limited to a local solution.</p>
<p>Here, the attitude and determination of England and France are extremely important. England and France have always sought compromise with Germany and Italy, coveting a shaky peace. As we have speculated and pointed out in our daily editorials, it has completely failed. The question now is how to use effective methods to stop the aggressor. England's own military preparations and mobilization are very active, but its efforts to create a collective anti-aggression effort are still insufficient. Not only are the steps slow, but the attitude is also extremely ambiguous. England is also facing a stern warning from Japan, a henchman of Germany and Italy, in the Far East. England's position really requires a resolute and swift measure. The United States, also in view of the turbulence of the world situation and the deepening crisis, is preparing to revise its mobilization plan so that it can mobilize one million people within three months to deal with sudden changes in the situation. This is a favorable condition for England to deal with the situation in the Far East. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's guarantee of assistance to small countries in Eastern Europe is also gradually becoming a reality, which is a powerful help for England to deal with the problems in Europe. It is reported that Europe will prioritize the formation of a joint front of thirteen countries in the near future. We hope that England will actively promote this favorable situation!</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Bombing: Chongqing Devastated, Chiang Kai-shek Inspects Disaster Area, Public and Private Vehicles Requisitioned for Urgent Evacuation, Rescue Efforts Remain Intense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The city has been subjected to relentless bombing by enemy aircraft in recent days, resulting in casualties and displacement of citizens. The President [Chiang Kai-shek] has expressed deep concern and took the opportunity of yesterday's (5th) Fifth-Fifth Anniversary Commemoration to encourage all Party, government, and military personnel to diligently engage in the evacuation and relief of refugees. After the commemoration, he convened a meeting with leaders of Party, government, and military organs to discuss mobilizing manpower and resources to implement emergency measures. It was decided that: (1) firebreaks should be opened and implemented promptly; (2) all public and private vehicles and ships should be concentrated to transport refugees; (3) the government should quickly allocate substantial funds to handle all rescue and relief matters; (4) all staff members of Party, government, and military organs above the rank of recommendation and appointment, and military officers above the rank of school officer, should donate at least one month's salary to aid refugees; (5) all city personnel, members of the Three People's Principles Youth League, civil servants, and various soldiers should be mobilized to assist in protection and relief work. The President designated Chief of Staff He Yingqin to be fully responsible for directing all matters. Chief of Staff He then conferred with relevant heads of organs and decided on multiple measures, with particular urgency placed on transporting the elderly, weak, women, and children out of the city. It was decided to control all public and private ships and vehicles for free transport. All related cars were mobilized. Personnel were dispatched to take care of refugee gathering points.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] After yesterday's intense bombing by Japanese aircraft, densely populated areas were reduced to ashes. Two hundred thousand city residents fled the urban area overnight, seeking refuge in the countryside. The city, which had been vibrant just days ago, has now become a wasteland of rubble, sparsely populated and filled with desolation. Water, electricity, lights, and telephones in the city have been cut off. This morning, newspapers only managed to publish small-sized extras twice. The Central News Agency headquarters was completely destroyed. Director Li Heyuan suffered serious injuries and Business Director Li Yaoqing was also severely injured and in critical condition. President of Central News Agency, Xiao Tongzi, and Editor-in-Chief, Chen Bosheng, were working in the office during the bombing but fortunately escaped unharmed. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife inspected the bombed areas twice last night and this morning. After his inspection last night, Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered the requisition of public and private cars and trucks to quickly transport people to the countryside. All city vehicles were gathered at designated locations this morning. Madame Chiang Kai-shek personally supervised the evacuation of child refugees. The evacuation of women and children from the city continued throughout the day and will continue until everyone is safely relocated. Those carrying out relief efforts were extremely busy today, distributing water and food along the evacuation routes to the countryside and making arrangements for housing. The Generalissimo ordered all city newspapers to cease publication last night, concentrating efforts on publishing a joint publication. A Reuters reporter personally inspected the bombed areas last night. Most streets were congested with evacuees, corpse carriers, firefighters, and civil defense volunteers, making passage difficult. The German Embassy was threatened by fire twice, but was fortunately extinguished and escaped damage. German Embassy officials told reporters that they witnessed over a hundred women and children being burned to death. The fire spread, forcing these women and children against the high walls of the German Embassy. As the fire approached, they were terrified but unable to escape and were eventually engulfed by the flames. The fires in the main streets of Chongqing, which started last night, were still burning this afternoon. The Central News Agency headquarters was in great danger. Due to the extensive fires and inconvenient water supply, firefighters faced extreme difficulties. It is reported that the British diplomatic mission and the British Consulate are considering relocating to the south bank of the Yangtze River because the consulate has been severely damaged. Semi-official sources have not confirmed this information. At the same time, unconfirmed reports indicate that the French Consulate was also bombed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] Thirty-six Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing yesterday, causing approximately 800 to 1,000 casualties. One Japanese aircraft was shot down. The Japanese planes attacked in two groups of eighteen each, focusing their bombing on military organs. However, the military organs had already been relocated, and the bombs hit surrounding civilian residences, causing hundreds of casualties. Half of Chongqing's urban area has lost its electricity supply, and telephone services are also disrupted. Thousands of homeless refugees are sleeping on the streets. The other half of the city still has lights and is living normally. The British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, witnessed the air raid yesterday.</p>
<p>British Ambassador's Remarks</p>
<p>Expresses Deep Sympathy for Our Civilian Casualties, Greatly Surprised by Bombing of British Consulate</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] It has been learned that Chongqing's only radio station has been destroyed, and the Central News Agency has also been hit and suffered significant damage. It is generally estimated that 25 Chinese sheltering in the grounds of the British Consulate were killed and 50 were injured. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's secretary, Hatherly, was slightly injured by falling debris while assisting in the rescue of the injured. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr told a "New York Times" reporter in Chongqing that he was shocked by the bombing of the British Consulate grounds and said, "The Chinese who died on the Consulate's lawn as a result of the bombing will forever remain in my heart. Yesterday afternoon, they requested refuge on the grounds, and I ordered the gates to be opened to accommodate them."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] According to reliable sources in Chongqing, British Ambassador’s Secretary Hatherly was injured by falling debris during yesterday's Japanese air raid and has been sent to the British warship "Eagle" for treatment. The situation in Chongqing is chaotic after yesterday's bombing. This information has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 5th] The British Embassy here has just received a message from Chongqing stating that the British Consulate in Chongqing and the nearby residence of the British Vice-Consul were bombed by Japanese aircraft yesterday, causing significant damage. British Ambassador's Secretary Hatherly was also slightly injured.</p>
<p>Preposterous Statement</p>
<p>Attempts to Shirk Responsibility for Bombing British and French Consulates, Foreign Properties Will No Longer Be Respected in the Future</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 5th] A Japanese spokesperson announced today that from now on, Japan will not be responsible for any damage to foreign properties and embassies during bombings in various parts of China. They stated that Japanese pilots have been ordered to bomb any location in China without regard for foreign properties and therefore hope that foreigners will stay away from Chinese territory. They expressed regret for the damage to various consulates during the bombing of Chongqing yesterday but claimed that the pilots had seen anti-aircraft guns near the consulates.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] Japanese officials issued a statement regarding yesterday's air raid on Chongqing, stating that "During the Japanese bombing, fifty anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns near the British, French, and German consulates in western Chongqing fiercely attacked, causing the Japanese aircraft to change their original targets and bomb the locations where anti-aircraft guns were installed. These locations were very close to the foreign consulates, so some bombs may have fallen near the consulates." A Japanese spokesperson met with reporters this afternoon and, in response to questions, said that Japanese air force pilots had been ordered to avoid "unnecessary" damage to foreign property, but in necessary situations, pilots could independently decide to act. For self-defense, the risk of damaging foreign property was unavoidable. For example, foreign property was damaged during yesterday's air raid on Chongqing, and the Japanese pilots were unaware of it, which is deeply regrettable. However, given that Japanese aircraft were attacked near foreign consulates, this was unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Chongqing After the Bombing: Black Smoke Fills the Sky, Flames Everywhere, Corpses Litter the Ground, a Grim Sight - Eyewitness Account by Associated Press Reporter</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 5th] China's wartime capital has now become a slaughterhouse for three thousand innocent people. The ferocity of yesterday's brutal Japanese bombing was unprecedented. The city's wooden buildings were engulfed in seven major fires, mostly reduced to ashes. Compared to the fires in Guangzhou and Wuhan, this is far more severe. Although Chinese warplanes densely intercepted in the sky, and the mountains around the city were filled with anti-aircraft gun positions, with intense artillery fire, thirty-two of the thirty-eight Japanese aircraft that attacked from Hankou still managed to penetrate the city's airspace and carry out a second major massacre within forty-eight hours. Within a short time, the enemy aircraft dropped more than a hundred bombs, with light and heavy incendiary bombs raining down on densely populated areas. Roads and buildings throughout the city immediately caught fire and spread. Cluster bombs, five hundred times the weight of incendiary bombs, were then dropped in rapid succession. The sound of explosions was continuous, shaking the earth. The dead, wounded, and buried alive numbered in the hundreds and thousands. After the Japanese planes left, the remaining survivors rose up and made every effort to assist in rescue efforts. There were seven major fires in the city, with black smoke rising into the sky and flames spreading in all directions. There was no running water here, and no pumps to draw water from the Yangtze River for rescue. Fortunately, the people were able to volunteer, each carrying buckets of water and passing them along to carry out the extinguishing. Although it was a drop in the bucket, it was still a great help. The American Church Hospital, Canadian Church, and schools were all destroyed by the fire. Fortunately, foreign missionaries escaped safely. As the reporter walked through the streets, he saw the fire blazing in the sky, and the cries shaking the wilderness. Among them, the fire in the central district was the most intense, spreading and expanding day and night, and it still hadn't been extinguished by this morning. Unofficial estimates put the number of victims at three thousand, which is the highest casualty toll in the history of bombing. The deaths and injuries of children were particularly tragic. The reporter saw one family with eight children, all of whom had died. Fortunately, all foreigners were safe, with only the representative of China National Aviation Corporation, Mr. Fan Qu, slightly injured. Mr. Fan lived in a Chinese hotel, which was hit by a bomb and then burned down. Foreign pilots of CNAC also lived there, but had been evacuated in advance. The reporter visited the hospital at night and saw bloodstains everywhere. Chinese and foreign doctors were competing to carry out rescue work, not stopping all night, but the dead were still carried out one after another, incalculable. The number of deaths in the commercial area was even more horrific. In an area one and a half miles long and five hundred yards wide, corpses were laid out, a sight too tragic to bear. Thanks to the heroic rescue efforts of firefighters and volunteers, most of the fires were contained, with only two fires remaining, still posing a threat, but they were also gradually being brought under control. Thousands of coolies were demolishing houses around the fires to prevent them from spreading. The Chinese side announced that one Japanese aircraft had been shot down. Part of the Central News Agency's headquarters was also bombed. The British and French consulates were both bombed. The British Ambassador was in the consulate and was fortunately safe. The German Embassy was once threatened by fire, but was rescued by firefighters and not affected.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Scheme Encompasses Resources in Central China, Disregarding British Railway Investment, Issuing Counterfeit Currency to Disrupt Our Finances</h3>
<p>Railway Company</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] According to the "China Press," the two major transportation and financial enterprises jointly operated by "China and Japan," namely the Central China Railway Company and the Huaxing Commercial Bank, are scheduled to be established in Shanghai on the 30th and 1st of this month. Each has a capital of 50 million yuan. The Railway Company is an affiliated organ of the Central China Development Company, which will manage 800 kilometers of railways in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River on behalf of the "Reformed Government," including the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, Beijing-Wuhu, and Songhu lines. These Chinese state-owned railways have now been handed over to the "Reformed Government." The company will also manage public car lines between various cities. Regarding the foreign debt problem of the various railway lines in which Britain has made significant investments, it will not be involved with the company because it is only an agent for managing the railways. The Central China Development Company will invest 25 million yuan in kind, with the first payment of 7.64 million yuan. Of the 25 million yuan in cash, the "Reformed Government" will contribute 10 million yuan, the Central China Development Company 6.5 million yuan, and the public 8.5 million yuan. A quarter of the cash will be paid when the company is established. The manager of the various railway lines is currently the Japanese Army Railway Department, but the company will take over management from tomorrow. The current fee rates will not be changed.</p>
<p>Huaxing Bank</p>
<p>The Huaxing Bank, initiated by the Japanese side, has been brewing for some time and is reportedly about to be established. The authorized capital is said to be 50 million yuan. The puppet "Reformed Government" and Japanese banks jointly invest in the bank, with the puppet "Reformed Government" contributing 25 million yuan and six Japanese banks (Industrial Bank of Japan, Bank of Chosen, Mitsubishi, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui, and Sumitomo) contributing 25 million yuan. The founding meeting is scheduled for 11:00 AM on May 1st at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. It is internally decided that Chen Jintao will concurrently serve as chairman of the board, and there will be an equal number of Japanese and Chinese standing directors. It is said that Shen Erchang, Zhou Wenrui, and others will be Chinese standing directors. The position of general manager is still being contested. The head office will be located in Shanghai, north of Suzhou Creek. It is said that No. 2 Baole'an Road has been selected. The collection and disbursement south of Suzhou Creek will be handled by Yokohama Specie Bank. The bank's goal is to disrupt Chinese finances, so it will also issue counterfeit currency, reportedly in denominations of ten yuan, five yuan, two jiao, and one jiao, and actively promote it within its controlled areas. On the one hand, it will set the price for exchanging the counterfeit currency for foreign exchange in an attempt to compete with legal tender, but in fact, because of the strong belief in legal tender by the Chinese and foreign people, this counterfeit currency will only become worthless paper after the "North China Joint Reserve Bank notes."</p>
<h3>Johnson's Broadcast Speech in America</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] The American Ambassador to China, Nelson T. Johnson, is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech at 10:00 PM (Shanghai time) tonight at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Central National Government Commemorates May Fifth</h3>

It is said that stores that make national flags have tripled their profits. At the same time, a Japanese spokesperson said that the Japanese side will protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding today's flag display.</p>
<h3>Shanghai International Settlement Inspects News, Our Press Faces Increasingly Difficult Environment Under Enemy Military Pressure</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] The Shanghai International Settlement Police Department has informed all Chinese newspapers that certain types of news must be submitted for inspection and can only be published after approval. If this is not followed, the newspaper's registration will be revoked, and its publication will be suspended. The news that must be inspected includes any speeches or declarations regarding the current war.</p>
<h3>Modern Mulan - Tang Guilin</h3>
<p>By Cao Juren</p>
<p>[Jiangshan Correspondence] The story of Tang Guilin, a woman from Hunan who disguised herself as a man to join the army and spent eight years on the battlefield, has been widely circulated. Many people want to know the details. When I sent a telegram from southern Anhui last time, Tang was still in Yushan, eastern Zhejiang, and I missed the opportunity to interview her. I came to Jiangshan from southern Anhui specifically to interview her, but she had already left Zhejiang and gone to Anhui to work with the army. The person was far away, and I was very disappointed. So I visited former subordinates of the ×× Division and ×× Regiment and collected some side materials to make a brief description first.</p>
<p>"Ms. Tang's speech has a Xiangxi accent. We are not very clear about her family background. She was only in the ×× Division for one year. When our division was being reorganized in Hunan ××, she and some other soldiers belonging to the ×× Division were transferred together. Most of her military life was in the predecessor of the ×× Division - the ×××× Regiment. She is very tall, and her skin is not very fair, which may be because she has been on the battlefield for too long, and the wind and dust have blown her."</p>
<p>The above fragments of answers gave the reporter a rough outline of a female soldier. The reporter also formulated several simple questions for further search.</p>
<p>Reporter: "Did anyone suspect her behavior?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen: "Who would have thought that a woman would dress as a man? That's something in novels. War is not a joke. She walks so big strides, so fast. Who would have had any other thoughts?"</p>
<p>Mr. Xu: "Her eyes are very beautiful."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen: "You know she is a woman, so naturally you think she is beautiful. But it's also strange, since she was discovered to be a woman, she has become shy. She no longer serves as a soldier but has gone to be a nurse."</p>
<p>Reporter: "How was she discovered this time?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen: "The squad leader in her platoon insisted on inviting her to take a bath. She always refused and quarreled with the squad leader. With a quarrel, she revealed her secret."</p>
<p>Reporter: "I heard that she was wounded in the battle of Dongguling. How could even the doctors and nurses not see it?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen: "She was injured in the ankle. I heard that she was dressed as a boy since she was a child. Her parents only raised her alone and treated her as a boy. She said that she herself had long forgotten that she was a woman."</p>
<p>Reporter: "She is really brave!"</p>
<p>Mr. Xu: "They say that she is very calm when fighting and is a very good machine gun shooter. In the battle of Dongguling, the enemy's artillery fire was really fierce. Those hills were fought over and over again, I don't know how many times. Ms. Tang charged several times until she was wounded and came down. If she hadn't revealed her true identity this time, she would have been promoted to squad leader."</p>
<p>These are just indirect materials. A more detailed description will have to wait for the reporter to visit directly. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Tongpu Railway Intercepted by Our Forces, Our Army Achieves Repeated Victories in Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 4th] The enemy is rushing to repair the highway from Heshun to Xiren Village (southwest of the city). On the 28th, about 300 enemies harassed Dongxiya near Heshun. Our forces divided and repelled them.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 4th] At dawn on the 2nd, the enemy artillery in Houwang Duancun (east of Anyi) fiercely bombarded our positions.

The two sides fought hand-to-hand several times. In this battle, more than 200 enemies were killed, and we only suffered dozens of casualties.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 5th] On the 30th of last month, a unit of our guerrilla team, taking advantage of the strong wind, cooperated with the local self-defense team to thoroughly excavate more than ten miles of the Chelu Road between Sengnian Baiyinmen in Fenxi and Sengnian in Fenxi. The telephone poles along the road were also knocked down. Our armed scouts rushed into Sengnian Village, destroyed the puppet maintenance committee, and seized many enemy puppet documents.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 5th] Enemy aircraft have been wantonly wreaking havoc in various counties in southeastern Shanxi in recent days.

<p>[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 5th] In the previous battle of Zikou in central Shanxi, the residents within a radius of tens of miles of the town all strictly implemented clearing the fields, practiced thrift, hid all utensils, filled all the wells, and the old and young, men and women, all moved far away. The enemy arrived as if entering a desert wasteland, and food and lodging were extremely difficult. The enemy who invaded southeastern Shanxi was defeated by our army in one fell swoop. At the moment, the remnant enemies entrenched in Zikou are also wavering. Our various units are stepping up their siege and can be completely eliminated in the short term.</p>

<h3>波外長演說表明談判原則　正式答覆德備忘錄　但澤地位不容改易</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] Polish Foreign Minister Beck delivered a speech to the parliament this morning that the world had been eagerly awaiting, in response to Hitler's speech. He stated, "The weakening of international organizations has, in recent months, affected Poland's borders, leading to extremely serious events. First, regarding the agreement between Poland and Britain, neither country has any intention of aggression, but is determined to uphold certain fundamental international principles. Hitler has used the British-Polish agreement as an excuse to abolish the German-Polish non-aggression pact. Germany did not consult with Britain or Poland beforehand and arbitrarily abandoned the treaty. Since my return from London, I have invited the German ambassador to meet, but he has not yet accepted the invitation. If Germany interprets the German-Polish pact as a means to isolate Poland, then Poland must reject such an interpretation. As for Danzig, although there is a large German population, its prosperity relies on Poland. We are determined to protect our rights and Danzig's overseas trade and tariff policies. Regarding the Polish Corridor, we have proposed expanding existing road transport facilities, but we have no reason to restrict our sovereignty within our own territory. Hitler's recent speech regarding a fifteen-year non-aggression treaty was not submitted to Poland in any concrete way. True peace must have two conditions: (1) the intention for peace, and (2) methods for peaceful action. If Germany adheres to these two principles, then the issues I have raised can be negotiated. Once negotiations begin, Poland will not lack sincerity. As for peace at any price, we do not know it. Politicians in London are familiar with European political issues and have shown a good attitude towards Poland, enabling me to present various important issues for frank discussion. I hope the public understands this point. Poland's response to the German memorandum will be delivered to Germany today. I would like to further clarify the status of the Free City of Danzig. It was not invented by the Treaty of Versailles. German merchants in Danzig are guaranteed to develop and prosper in the city. Poland's overseas trade allows Danzig to thrive. Danzig is located at the mouth of Poland's only major river. Its current position is a key waterway and railway line connecting Poland to the Baltic Sea. This is a definite fact that cannot be changed by any agreement. Poland has never attempted to implement any liberal, idealistic, or cultural development to influence the Germans in the Free City of Danzig. We want to ask whether the current issue is about the freedom of the Germans in Danzig or about isolating Poland from the Baltic Sea. We will never allow ourselves to be isolated."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 4th] The Polish Parliament will convene tomorrow at 11:00 AM to hear Foreign Minister Beck's response to Hitler's speech. Beck is scheduled to begin his speech at 11:15 AM, which will be broadcast nationwide in Poland and re-broadcast to the United States. It will also be broadcast in English, French, and German.</p>
<p>France Decides to Act Consistently with Poland, German Troops Head North</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Europe awaits Beck's speech tomorrow with the same eagerness as they usually await speeches from Chamberlain or Hitler. Authoritative sources in Paris and Berlin have commented on it in advance. France has emphasized that it has decided to act consistently with Poland, and Poland will be the sole judge of whether its major interests have been affected. The French cabinet will meet on the morning of the 6th. Berlin's "People's Observer" published an article by Goebbels, stating that Poland's demands are intolerable and criticizing Britain's support for Poland. It is believed that Ribbentrop will discuss Beck's speech with Hitler before visiting Ciano tomorrow evening.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Official sources say that there is no concrete resolution or development resulting from German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy, but discussions between Germany and Italy on the status of Danzig, Poland, and Yugoslavia are of great importance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] German stormtroopers, army units, assault tank units, and several heavy artillery units are all departing from Munich and heading north. Only a very small number of troops remain in the town. Officials claim that this military action has no special significance.</p>
<h3>美擴充海軍　李海要求加速完成建主力艦對抗日本</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] U.S. Navy tactical director Admiral Leahy solemnly declared before the House Appropriations Committee today that, given the possibility of an imminent international turmoil, the U.S. Navy's expansion program must be completed at an accelerated pace. He paid particular attention to the future plans of Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is said that Japan has already begun building three 42,000 to 46,000-ton battleships, so the United States, to maintain balance, must immediately begin building the proposed 45,000-ton battleships this year. The construction costs of the U.S. battleships are included in the Navy's budget of $770 million, which includes the construction of two 45,000-ton battleships and 21 other warships, as well as 500 aircraft. The new battleships are scheduled to be launched in 1943, costing $93 million each, and will be equipped with 16-inch heavy guns. The Appropriations Committee passed the budget, but decided to reject the request for funds to begin building U.S. naval air bases on Pacific islands (Wake, Midway, Palmyra, Johnston), but approved funds for building air and naval bases in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Florida, and Oregon.</p>
<h3>日本缺鋼　造艦受阻礙</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The Department of Commerce recently announced that Japan is currently lacking steel and other metals, greatly hindering its shipbuilding plans. Kobe U.S. Vice Consul Affeld stated that, according to general estimates, Japan needs 7.5 million tons of iron ore this year, while its domestic production is only 2.6 million tons.</p>
<h3>英向日抗議　要求釋放英輪</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Regarding the case of the British "Saygel" being detained by the Japanese on April 8, British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that Britain has protested to the Japanese naval authorities in China and the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, demanding the release of the ship.</p>
<h3>德意日締結　軍事同盟說　德万巳予否認　日本拒絕批評</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th] Rumors are circulating that Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently negotiating a military alliance treaty. Responsible officials here have denied this. According to sources in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita did meet with the German and Italian ambassadors to discuss the European situation, intending to obtain accurate information from the most reliable sources. Japan's concern about the European situation is natural.</p>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Discusses European Situation</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita reported on the European situation at the cabinet meeting this morning. When a Foreign Ministry spokesman was asked by Japanese reporters this morning to explain the policies Japan is adopting regarding the European situation, the spokesman refused to comment on the rumors of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and stated that Japan has its own independent foreign policy. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have repeatedly stated that this policy is not hostile to democratic countries or totalitarian groups, and its sole purpose is to maintain and promote friendly relations with all foreign countries.</p>
<h3>蘇駐美大使　內定奧曼斯基</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] It has been learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Union will submit a nomination for Oumansky as the Ambassador to the United States this week and seek the consent of the United States.</p>
<h3>僑德英婦　漢門女士被逐</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] The German government has ordered Miss Hammon, the secretary of the Berlin office of the British "Daily Telegraph," to leave Germany within fourteen days, without announcing a reason. Miss Hammon is the first British woman residing in Germany to be expelled.</p>
<h3>直布羅陀總督　訪法屬摩洛哥司令</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 4th] The Governor of Gibraltar, General Arun Se, is currently visiting the commander of French Morocco. The commander-in-chief of the British forces in Gibraltar has been appointed as the acting governor.</p>
<h3>蘇聯將回復　孤立政策　以自力迎擊打擊者　易外長係對英警告</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] Officials here still refuse to comment on Litvinov's resignation. Foreign officials are also tight-lipped. The announcement of Litvinov's resignation was only published in a very small space on the back page of the newspaper, while Molotov's succession was published prominently on the front page as a government order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] The sudden resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister has caused shock in diplomatic circles here. Their first impression is that this is a victory for Soviet isolationists, who have always opposed Litvinov's policy of cooperation with Western European countries. When reporters asked the Soviet Ambassador to Britain about this news at a dinner hosted by the China Association, he refused to comment. Other Soviet sources also declined to explain. However, it was speculated by Soviet sources a few days ago that if Britain and France refused to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would suspend these negotiations. Therefore, it is generally believed that these Soviet isolationists, including military commissioners, believe that if Britain and France do not support anti-aggression actions in Europe, the Soviet Union should retreat within the Soviet borders to prepare to strike directly at those who attack the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Newspapers here are still constantly speculating on the reasons for Litvinov's resignation, but "The Times," "News Chronicle," and "Daily Herald" all stated that British-Soviet negotiations and Soviet foreign policy will not be affected.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 4th] Observers in political circles here believe that Litvinov's resignation is due to his constant compromising attitude with Britain. They believe that since the military mutual assistance agreement between France, Poland, and the Soviet Union failed to materialize, the Soviet authorities have decided to change their diplomatic stance and return to their original isolation policy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] The "Times" here announced today that Litvinov was pro-British. This time, the Soviet government dismissed him as a warning to Britain for its hesitation to sign a British-Soviet alliance. This move can be seen as a diplomatic strategy, not necessarily a change in policy. "News" stated that Molotov's replacement of Litvinov indicates that Stalin will personally take charge of foreign policy.</p>
<h3>德與拉達維亞　同意訂不侵約　與愛沙尼亞談判中</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] It was officially announced that Germany and Latvia have agreed to conclude a non-aggression treaty. Germany and Estonia are also conducting negotiations of the same nature.</p>
<h3>歐局發展　美密切注意</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] There are widespread rumors that President Roosevelt may have new diplomatic initiatives after Hitler rejected his peace telegram, and may make another speech. However, according to people close to the President, the President believes that the current international situation has become slightly more stable, so he does not intend to take further action. However, the U.S. government is closely monitoring the development of the situation.</p>
<h3>英徵兵法案　提出下院二讀　張伯倫聲明政府決心　艾登演說贊成新兵制</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Chamberlain presented the Military Training Bill for its second reading in the House of Commons today and gave a general explanation, stating that, according to the bill, 200,000 people can be obtained this year, and approximately 800,000 people within three years. After reviewing the evidence presented throughout the country, the government's carefully considered proposal to eliminate the public's fear and suspicion of conscription has been successful. There is no doubt that the British people's resolute determination to fulfill their responsibilities has gained great admiration from European countries. Even for those who oppose it, this measure is very different from the previous Great War. This conscription method does not involve sending recruits to serve abroad or dig trenches for combat, but is limited to a short period of compulsory military training. The government is willing to respect the doubts expressed by individual consciences and will not punish them even if such psychology exists. During the initial six-month period of service, each person will receive a salary of one shilling per day, regardless of position or team type, which will be the same across the board, without increase or decrease, and will be paid on time. Their salary will be determined separately after entering the supplementary service. As for those who are absolutely responsible for their families, they will receive seventeen shillings per week; those who are partially responsible will receive twelve shillings per week; their wives will receive seventeen shillings per week, and children will receive additional grants. The government has specifically reduced the minimum age for receiving this treatment to 20 years old. The bill does not apply to Northern Ireland, and the government will amend it before implementation. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has entrusted the right of decision to the British government to avoid misunderstandings. To show appreciation for Northern Ireland's patriotism, a light tank team of armored vehicles will be established as a supplementary reserve system. Chamberlain concluded by saying, "The sooner this bill is passed, the sooner the country's security can be guaranteed, and the greater the impact it will have on European countries." Opposition Labor Party member Smith proposed an amendment, the main reason being "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut," meaning that there is no need to carry out such a major action. Opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair also expressed support for the voluntary conscription system. Eden also stood up and spoke, stating amid applause from the entire house that although the voluntary conscription system has not been completely abandoned, the government has now adopted another new principle, which is a matter of fact, but no one dares to deprive the freedom of national service. It is absurd to say that the implementation of the conscription system is the first step towards Britain's slide into totalitarianism. Even if the government has such a tendency, the House of Commons can immediately stop it. In short, without the strong support of the people, Britain will never have any form of compulsory military service. Labor Minister Brown stated that it is incorrect to say that voluntary registration for service will end after the conscription bill is introduced. He cited statistics to show that the number of people voluntarily registering for service in the weeks since the conscription bill was introduced has not decreased, and said that the impact of the bill on the European situation is more profound than any other event in recent weeks.</p>

<h3>國際現勢縱橫談</h3>
<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Liao Chongsheng, is a former professor at the National Sun Yat-sen University's College of Agriculture and the Lingnan University's College of Commerce, and a specialist member of the Guangxi Provincial Government's Economic Commission. The purpose of writing this article is to reflect the optimism of our country's prospects for the War of Resistance through a comprehensive analysis of the recent international situation. The content is substantial, and the exploration of the United States' economic resources, foreign diplomatic trends, and presidential powers is particularly detailed. It is specially introduced here for reference by those who study international relations.</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia is gone, and international order and treaty dignity have been swept away. Is this only the misfortune of small and weak nations? Or is it a strange shame of modern civilization! However, the evolution of human groups always comes from painful experiences. The sacrifice of Czechoslovakia is not without considerable cost. The director of this tragedy, and the key to the European situation, the British authorities, have suffered this blow and have painfully realized their past mistakes. They are determined to work together with democratic countries to curb the further spread of the tide of aggression. Now, the independence of Poland, Romania, and Greece has been guaranteed by declarations from Britain and France, and cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is under active negotiation. For a time, the situation in Western Europe, especially in the Mediterranean, has become more urgent. Is this the eve of a great war? Or is it the dying light of dictators? What are the reactions of the Soviet Union and the United States, which are of paramount importance? How should our country make use of this opportunity? I would like to offer my humble opinion.</p>
<p>II. A General Review of the United States' Strength and Diplomatic Trends</p>
<p>When interviewing Mr. Sinclair, a member of the British Labor Party, about questions regarding war against Japan and the implementation of economic sanctions, Mr. Sinclair repeatedly answered "it depends on the attitude of the United States." In fact, the sudden shift in Britain's anti-aggression attitude is also strongly influenced by the encouragement of American public opinion and substance. Its impact is not limited to a corner of the Far East. How can the United States, far across the ocean, be a factor of paramount importance in world politics? Let us examine its strength and diplomatic trends to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of national defense, the strength of a country is always judged by the degree of development of its heavy industries and the abundance of its economic resources. The scale of the United States' heavy industry is huge, the equipment is reasonable, and the production capacity is high. Not only can European powers not hope to reach its level, but its economic resources are also unmatched by other countries. According to a comparison of the production status of various countries in 1937, the production capacity of American pig iron can reach 72 million tons per year, and if the environment requires it, it can be expanded to more than 100 million tons per year within two years. Although other powers have actively expanded their military in recent years, their total annual production is only 76 million tons. The difference in the manufacture of motorcycles is even more astonishing. Although American automobile factories were closed due to labor unrest this year, their output was still no less than 5 million vehicles; while the combined output of all other countries in the world was only 1.3 million vehicles. As for the production of kerosene, the powers have no comparison. The United States and South America combined account for 77% of global production. In addition, it is estimated that 60% of the world's gold coins are controlled by the country. Steel is the foundation of industry and military construction; automobiles are the backbone of mechanized infantry; kerosene is the blood of modern weapons; spot goods are the most effective weapon to control the financial market. Now, with the power of one country, either equal to the world, or even superior to it, its role as the key to world peace is obvious.</p>
<p>What's more, the aggressive countries of today rely more and more on the United States as they strive for military and economic self-sufficiency. In recent years, the export of American agricultural products has decreased by 60% compared with the average export volume from 1926 to 1930 (the golden age of American commerce). However, the export of mechanical raw materials related to military expansion has increased dramatically. For example, in 1937, the export of its trucks was three times that of the golden age of commerce in the past (that is, the average from 1926 to 1930); aircraft were more than eight times; raw oil was three times, scrap iron was sixteen times; and steel products also exceeded the golden age by 77%. In addition, electrical equipment, chemical industrial products, and all other industrial machinery have increased sharply compared to before. The main customers are Britain, the Soviet Union, and the three major aggressive countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan. From this, we can see that the United States, with its economic weapons alone, is enough to control the fate of the aggressors with ease.</p>
<p>American public opinion on the fascist group has always been opposed to it due to the fundamental divergence in political ideology, and the constant encouragement and cultivation of President Roosevelt's far-sighted vision. Not only has it always been opposed to it, but its aversion has grown deeper. However, the executive authorities are hindered by the obstruction of the isolationist faction, and also suffer from the many constraints of the legislative branch. In addition to verbal attacks, there is a lack of positive or actionable achievements. What is gratifying is that this dull situation has recently shown signs of gradually breaking down. President Roosevelt, who is both wise and intelligent, has resolutely decided, within the scope of the powers conferred on him by the Constitution, to give the aggressors a de facto blow.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Women's Pathways</h3>
<p>Starting from a Perplexed Woman</p>
<p>Today, our newspaper's Hong Kong news section published an article by Qi Zhuo titled "She Donated Blood, and Fainted!" This record contains a current issue regarding women's pathways. We believe this is a serious social problem, and it is very important to the future of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Ms. Cen is the daughter of a wealthy family with six mothers. She has always been confined within the feudal cage. However, the tide of the times and the call for national liberation have finally stirred her up. She serves the country and society at the wartime children's school of the Guangzhou YMCA. However, since the iron hooves of the invaders trampled on our sacred revolutionary city, she lost the opportunity to serve. Government agencies and national salvation organizations did not pay attention to her, so she became a lost lamb, looking around blankly, unable to find a job, seeing only the darkness and sin that made her feel painful and angry! Her enthusiasm had nowhere to go, and she fainted in front of the public during an impassioned speech.</p>
<p>In fact, looking around, there are countless women who are filled with enthusiasm but cannot serve the country and society or fight for their own freedom. It's not just Ms. Cen alone! If knowledgeable women are like this, how many other housewives and working women who are not as aware as Ms. Cen are there? If women with a sense of national society and full of enthusiasm for liberation are like this, what about the hundreds of millions of other women who are struggling in misery? This is a problem that people who are working hard on mass mobilization and the cause of resistance and nation-building today cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Everyone already knows that women can only truly solve the problem of their pathways by participating in the resistance and nation-building, and striving for national liberation. To participate in the cause of resistance and nation-building, the first thing to do is to bravely and resolutely participate in collective life, work hard to study, pay attention to self-cultivation, increase the strength of women's unity, strive for opportunities for women to serve in the resistance and nation-building, and enhance women's social and political status. At present, many groups, although unable to fully satisfy everyone, and even still have many sad and angry phenomena, but seeking liberation is originally a kind of struggle. If all good people retreat cleanly, then the social groups will never have hope of progress. This is what we ask Ms. Cen and the thousands of women who cannot find a way out to deeply recognize, control their emotions, and strive forward.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current cause of resistance and nation-building needs talents everywhere; women's organizations are even more in need of enriching their strength and expanding their front lines. However, on the other hand, there are still many people who cannot find work and are reduced to sadness and fainting. This is a responsibility that social leaders cannot shirk! We earnestly hope that various groups can eliminate prejudices, help each other, work practically, pay attention to and promote truly talented people from all sides, enrich their strength, and increase their effectiveness. At the same time, it is also necessary to launch women's mobilization work among housewives and working women, which can not only invigorate the vast and scattered powerless women and make them a majestic new force in the resistance and nation-building, but also can promote many new cadres to serve as the backbone of the women's liberation movement, preparing to fundamentally solve the problem of women's pathways. This is also what we sincerely hope that women's organizations and leaders from all walks of life will strive for!</p>

<h3>Philippine Customs Strictly Crack Down on Hong Kong Repackaged Bolts of Cloth Sold in the Philippines; Philippine Industrialists Form a Large-Scale Rayon Factory; Hong Kong Textile Sales to the Philippines Will Face a Major Blow in the Future</h3>
<p>For several years, it has been extremely active for bolts of cloth of * origin that are repackaged in Hong Kong and shipped to the Philippines for sale. Every year, regardless of winter or summer, there are huge numbers of these bolts of cloth. Since the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan began, this kind of repackaged bolts of cloth shipped from Hong Kong to the Philippines has become even more prevalent. This is because our overseas Chinese compatriots in the Philippines and local American and Filipino people all unanimously refuse to buy * goods. * merchants have no choice but to resort to various tricks, transporting a large number of wool, cotton textiles, and rayon to Hong Kong, and then repackaging them as products from Chinese factories and European and American factories, before attaching them to ships from Hong Kong to the Philippines, in order to pass fish eyes for pearls and carry out their conspiracy of selling at low prices to seize the market. However, the Philippine authorities have long since begun to pay special attention to this. Two commissioners were dispatched by the Customs from Hong Kong some months ago, to investigate the truth of the matter. After returning to the Philippines, they have submitted a detailed report on their findings.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection to Prevent Imports</p>
<p>According to sources from the Hong Kong-Philippines Merchants' Bank yesterday, the Philippine government, after receiving the report from the two commissioners who investigated in Hong Kong, determined that this kind of repackaged * goods shipped from Hong Kong to the Philippines not only directly dealt a considerable blow to the American and Filipino textile industries, but also had a significant impact on the sales of bolts of cloth produced by other countries in the Philippines, invisibly creating a major obstacle to the Philippine market economy. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly crack down on and prevent it. The government is now carefully considering countermeasures, strictly instructing Philippine customs officials to earnestly implement the various steps that have been decided upon. Since the beginning of the month or so, it has been quite effective. During this period, many cases of this kind of repackaged bolts of cloth have been discovered and all have been refused entry, being returned to Hong Kong on the original ship. Because of this strict inspection, the number of * bolts of cloth that are repackaged in Hong Kong and shipped to the Philippines is now decreasing day by day. At the same time, the sales of Hong Kong-made textiles to the Philippines are increasing day by day, which is of great benefit to the Hong Kong weaving industry.</p>
<p>The Philippines Will Establish a Rayon Factory</p>
<p>However, the Philippine government and industrialists, in view of the huge amount of * rayon and Chinese silk that have been sold to the Philippines in recent years, especially * rayon, which accounts for nearly 70 percent, and because the climate of the Philippine Islands is mild and the hot season is long, and the people of the island prefer to use silk bolts of cloth to make clothes, which is a great loss to the Philippines' own interests, are striving to reverse this huge drain. Recently, the National Enterprises Corporation, which is operated by the Philippine government, has planned to organize a large-scale rayon factory to engage in the production of rayon. The estimated capital is about US$2 million, and it can produce 3.5 tons of rayon per day. The hemp, bamboo, grass, and cork in the Philippines can be used as raw materials. The establishment of this factory will certainly completely reject * rayon from the Philippine market, and at the same time, the sales of textile products produced by Hong Kong factories in the Philippines will also face a major blow in the future. It is reported that the Hong Kong factory products that are sold to the Philippines are mainly cotton silk undershirts, cotton silk socks, and summer local cloth.</p>
<h3>The Joint Relief Association's Research Committee Begins Investigating Mistreated Refugees; Will Appeal to Representatives to Convey to the Hong Kong Government; First Committee Meeting to Be Held Next Week to Discuss Implementation</h3>
<p>The recent incidents of refugees being mistreated in the New Territories refugee camps have aroused attention from all parties and have been reported in the newspapers. The Hong Kong Joint Relief Association has also received a letter from the Yikeng Jinka refugees in Fanling, stating that in addition to being mistreated, they also requested that the association follow the previous method and ask to set up sheds in Shenzhen to accommodate them. The person in charge of the association paid great attention to this matter. After passing the standing committee meeting, the Women's War Disaster Association, the Journalists' Association, the Manufacturers' Association, and the Kwongtung Chamber of Commerce were selected to form a committee to study the mistreatment of refugees, and to investigate the whole story of the mistreatment of refugees. The investigation committee has scheduled its first meeting within this week to jointly discuss the implementation. However, before the meeting is held, it is necessary to obtain considerable evidence. At present, the investigation team has dispatched personnel to various refugee camps in the New Territories to investigate. If evidence is obtained, it will definitely appeal to the representatives to convey it to the Hong Kong government for effective improvement, in order to conform to the purpose of relief.</p>
<h3>Youth Journalists Association Held National Covenant Oath Movement Yesterday; More Than 200 Participants, Simple and Solemn; Xu Shiying and Wang Xiaolai Attended as Witnesses</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association held the Hong Kong News Reporter Spiritual Mobilization and National Covenant Oath Movement at Kong Saint Hall on Carlow Lane yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, Wang Xiaolai, a member of the Central Committee, and more than 200 reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and local newspapers in Hong Kong, attended. The oath ceremony was simple and solemn. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>News Reporters Are in a Leading Position</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Guo Butao gave an opening speech, saying that the National Covenant promulgated by the highest leader, all citizens should take an oath to abide by it without fail. News reporters are in a leading position in the society and should do their best to promote it. On the active side, it can enhance the strength of the war of resistance, and in terms of news, it can also eliminate the activities of traitors.</p>
<p>Oath Ceremony is Simple and Solemn</p>
<p>After the chairman's speech, the oath was taken, with Xu Shiying, the Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, and Wang Xiaolai, a member of the Central Committee, as witnesses. All the reporters present who participated in the oath raised their right hands, stood solemnly, and silently read the 16 articles of the covenant (plus four additional articles). Then, under the leadership of the chairman, they recited the oath, saying, "We swear in good conscience to abide by the National Covenant, absolutely support the National Government, obey the leadership of the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek, do our best, and serve the country. If there is any breach of oath, we are willing to be punished by the government. We solemnly swear." Thus, this simple and solemn oath ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying's Heartfelt Words</p>
<p>Then, Xu Shiying, the witness, delivered a speech, roughly saying, "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of everyone. The national crisis has reached the most serious stage. All the people of the country should actively take on their due responsibilities, step up our spiritual mobilization, and win the victory of the war of resistance. Therefore, the promotion of the National Covenant and oath is of great significance. However, the oath of this covenant can be divided into two types: formal and spiritual. If you don't swear in good conscience, but only do superficial formal work, it is useless. However, many people are unwilling to even hold this kind of form. Today, the Hong Kong Branch of the Youth Journalists Association is holding the Hong Kong News Reporter Signature Oath Ceremony. Although the ceremony is simple, the significance is very significant. I hope that everyone will work harder in the future to win the victory of the war of resistance and the success of nation-building." Finally, Wang Xiaolai and other members of the Central Committee gave speeches respectively, and then the Chinese Chorus sang patriotic songs, the singing was majestic and resounded through the sky, receiving no small amount of praise. After taking pictures, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Phoenix City: China Travel Troupe Re-performs; 12th Night at the Queen's Theatre</h3>
<p>The new famous play "Phoenix City" by the "China Travel Troupe" was performed for the Women's Federation last time at the Queen's Theatre. That night, it rained heavily, but there were still many viewers. However, there were also many people who were turned away. Because the play has attracted the attention of people in Hong Kong, it has been specially decided to perform one more show at the Queen's Theatre on the 12th of this month. The ticket price is lower than the charity performance, in order to provide a universal contribution to the appreciation of all sectors. The members of the "China Travel Troupe" not only have skilled acting skills for this play, but also are putting in their greatest efforts for the troupe's first performance after its reconstruction, hoping to lay its foundation in the theatrical world, and the results are more impressive than before.</p>
<h3>Ending of Huanghuagang Charity Performance; China Arts Troupe Schedules Another Performance; 9th to 14th for Six Consecutive Days at the Popular Celebration Theatre; The Program Includes Seven Famous Plays Such As "In the Green Gauze Tent"</h3>
<p>The grand alliance of the Hong Kong theatrical community is raising funds for the Joint Relief Association for all sectors to relieve the refugees in South China and comfort the families of the soldiers who died in front, and performed the historical drama of the Civil Revolution, "Huanghuagang", at the Taiping Theatre on the memorial days of May 3, May 4, and May 5. The results were very good. The Huanghuagang Performance Committee has scheduled a closing meeting at the China Children's College on Shandong Street, Mong Kok, at 1:00 PM tomorrow. Because the ticket price was too high this time, the Joint Relief Association specifically requested the performance committee to perform again, with the ticket price being popular in order to be universal. The most sound drama group in Hong Kong, the China Art Troupe, has fully participated in the performance work of Huanghuagang. Because of the language relationship, the actors of China Art Troupe have not been able to fully exert their talents, and the pillars of China Art Troupe, such as Jiang Ming, Qiu Xinghai, etc., Dong Yue and others also joined in to play non-speaking roles, while others participated in backstage work. Since its establishment, in addition to cooperating with the Wu Huan Chorus, performing charity performances at the Entertainment Theatre, and raising funds for the Hong Kong Youth Relief Association at the Gaosheng Theatre, and also holding巡迴charity performances in various community schools, the China Art Troupe itself has performed three times at the Central Theatre and once at the Puqing Theatre. The work situation is extremely tense and strenuous. Now that the Huanghuagang charity performance is over, it has been decided to perform at the Kowloon Puqing Theatre for six consecutive days from the 9th to the 14th of this month. The plays include In the Green Gauze Tent, Dawn, Chinese Men, Losing Your Head, The Song of Righteousness, Di Si Niang, The Hypocrite, etc. The content is very rich, starting at 8:00 PM every night, and on Saturdays and Sundays, there will also be a day show.</p>

<h3>Evidence of the Inevitable Victory of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Kang Zhi</p>
<p>After Watching the Sixth Collection of Special Editions on the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Special Feature: "The Sixth Collection of Special Editions on the War of Resistance" was test-screened yesterday, undoubtedly. This is the bloody truth, a record of the rebirth of the Chinese nation. The brave and bloody soldiers on the front lines are using their hot blood to open the flowers of national freedom. The great victory of De'an and the bitter struggle of the lone army on the Lushan Mountain fully demonstrate the fearless spirit of every soldier who regards death as home in order to win the victory. Each shot reflecting the dynamics of the rear is a full expression of coordination and response with the front line. The enthusiastic donations of compatriots, regardless of old or young, and the warm farewells to the soldiers going to war, show that the unity of the army and the people is an unprecedented miracle. And the enthusiastic consolation of wounded soldiers and the clothing donation movement are all symbols of the harbinger of the Chinese nation's victory in the war of resistance!</p>
<p>The fact that the audience stood up to pay tribute to the leader's portrait being shown on the screen cannot help but remind people of a certain occupied area, where the * people forcibly occupied the movie theater that was not completely destroyed and used it as a propaganda tool to poison our compatriots in the occupied area. The * people relied on fabricated rumors to alienate our unity and injure our leaders, but the performance of those films made the vast audience more deeply aware of the greatness of the leaders, and they also stood up to pay tribute and applaud, and the * pseudo-police were also at a loss and unable to interfere. The unity of the will to resist is possessed by every compatriot with blood, whether in the war zone or in the rear, except for a group of traitors with ulterior motives and no blood. Finally, we hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will see this film of special editions on the war of resistance, and that even compatriots in the mainland and even in the occupied areas can see this film of special editions on the war. Let us strengthen our self-confidence and more actively meet the victorious tomorrow with struggle!</p>
<p>(Due to space constraints, please refer to this newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly tomorrow for information about the special edition on the War of Resistance.)</p>
<h3>A Hollywood Movie Circle Couple Honeymooning in Hong Kong; Movie Fans Welcome at Tea Dance in Grand Hotel; Again Fly South by Plane Before Dawn This Morning</h3>
<p>American movie star Jenny Hephtobin and her husband, Gan Linjili, came to East Asia to travel. They arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning on the Japanese Queen. After landing, they went to the reserved room at the Hong Kong Grand Hotel to rest. At 10:45, they drove to tour the famous scenic spots of the island, and they were very interested in the western district of Hong Kong. After visiting the top of the mountain, they drove to Repulse Bay and had lunch there. At 5:00 PM, Hong Kong movie fans held a tea dance at the Hong Kong Grand Hotel to welcome them. The famous couple in the film industry arrived on time, and the situation was enthusiastic. Until 8:15, they went to the broadcasting station to do a dialogue broadcast, and then at the invitation of the Entertainment Theatre, they participated in a dinner party set up at the English Capital Restaurant.

<h3>A Million Anguished Women: She Donated Money and Fainted</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Control emotions with reason and participate in progressive collective life!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, at midnight, when the "Yellow Flower Mound" performance reached its 'finale,' under an extremely tense atmosphere, a young woman suddenly went on stage and gave a generous speech, startling everyone. She began speaking calmly, "Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me for saying a few words. I am too excited, too moved! We women, who make up half of the population, should be thoroughly awakened. I now donate these five dollars, according to my ability, to comfort the families of the fallen soldiers. I hope that all of you present will encourage your husbands, encourage your sons, to defend our country. Only then can we live up to the spirits of the Premier and the seventy-two martyrs in heaven..." However, because she was too excited, her wording became repetitive and chaotic! She walked back and forth, repeatedly saluting the Premier and the portraits of the Yellow Flower Mound martyrs, repeatedly saying sorry and being very "impolite."</p>
<p>Was this a pre-arranged audience hinted at by the director, or a truly spontaneous audience? The audience present was confused.</p>
<p>The chairman on stage, taking advantage of a slight pause in her speech, very cleverly continued, shouting slogans. Only then did the curtain close successfully.</p>
<p>Many people rushed forward to ask what was going on. They learned that she was a genuine audience member who was moved by the scene, a refugee from Guangzhou named Cen ××, living at ×× Prince Road. Because she was too excited, she finally fainted. After first aid, her spirit gradually recovered. When the reporter rushed back to the newspaper office, it was already one o'clock in the morning, too late for typesetting. Only a small special report was published yesterday to meet the readers. This is not a simple matter, so the reporter went to interview Ms. Cen in detail yesterday.</p>
<p>Upon meeting her, he first expressed his respect for her courage and enthusiasm and inquired about her mental well-being. Ms. Cen said very sincerely, "Thank you, my spirit has recovered! I am very sorry. Last night, reason could not control emotion. The more I spoke on the stage, the more unnatural I became. I knew that some of the audience were laughing at my abnormality. Alas! There was just too much I wanted to say!" She then continued to speak enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Her family background was petit-bourgeois and feudal. She lived in Xiguan, Guangzhou. Because her father was a businessman and his thinking was very outdated, she was forced to drop out of Guangzhou Union Women's Normal School midway. A year later, even the family tutor was gone. She liked movies, dramas, and music, but she was not allowed to develop her interests. From then on, she studied classical Chinese at home and worked hard for six years. In the meantime, because of her mother's death, and because she was not allowed to study or have freedom, the stimulation of being cooped up at home was too unbearable, and she showed a state of negative pessimism.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, her passion to dedicate herself to serving the war effort burned like fire. Fortunately, through the introduction of the executive director of the Guangzhou Youth Association, she took on the role of head teacher at the Youth Association's wartime children's school. She had studied education and loved children very much. No matter how naughty the students were, she was interested in making them better, and she felt it was very meaningful. Although she could only receive a few dollars of living expenses as a stipend, she was proud that her spirit was entrusted to work, children, the organization, and the country.</p>
<p>However, the ruthless artillery fire of the × people destroyed their school. For a while, they couldn't find a new school site, which was a serious blow to her work, and she began to feel empty and lost again.</p>
<p>On October 21, Guangzhou fell. On the 20th, she and her family left Guangzhou for their old home in Jiujiang in extreme danger. The experience in the countryside of Jiujiang was very unpleasant. Out of desperation, they came to Hong Kong with great difficulty forty days ago. She felt very painful inside that the motherland was struggling while she was relying on the favor of others here. However, her strength was limited, so she had no choice but to temporarily stay here and look for work.</p>
<p>However, the impression of ×× was too bad for her! The licentious and shameless indulgence simply ignored the national crisis! She wanted to join the film industry, but the corrupt and outdated environment made her afraid to accept. Educating children was her duty, and she was very interested in it, but the commercialized education industry also made her heartbroken. Her enthusiasm could not be developed, and she had no opportunity to serve. Darkness surrounded her, and she could not see a bright side. Without the encouragement of progressive and serious friends, she could not withstand the bad stimulation. Less than ten days after she arrived in Hong Kong, she suddenly wanted to risk returning to the mainland, but her relatives stopped her again. She had money to live on, but without work, her spirit had nowhere to rest, which was very painful. This time, she was deeply moved by "Yellow Flower Mound." Mr. Zhong Qinan, who gave the speech on stage, was also her director four years ago. With mixed feelings, she could not help but go on stage to speak and donate money, and finally fainted from excessive excitement.</p>
<p>From this typical situation, we gain a lot of inspiration:</p>
<p>How many awakened women are threatened by feudal families, not just her alone?</p>
<p>How many women are depressed and anguished because their spirits cannot be developed, not just her alone? How many people see the dark side but not the bright side, are stimulated by bad friends but not comforted by good friends, not just her alone?</p>
<p>How many people cannot control their emotions with reason, not just her alone?</p>
<p>How many people have such encounters in the Anti-Japanese War, not just her alone?</p>
<p>How many people are moved by the vivid content of Anti-Japanese war dramas, not just her alone?</p>

<h3>The Situation in Eastern Guangdong is Tense Again: × Aircraft Bomb Shantou City Madly for Days, More Than a Hundred Houses Destroyed in the Wubridge Area, a Terrible Disaster, Yesterday Morning the City Center Was Madly Bombed Again, Many Dead and Wounded</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 5th] Japanese planes attacked Shantou again this morning, bombing the city center wildly and strafing with machine guns, causing many civilian casualties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 5th] Many Japanese planes continued to bomb Shantou today. Shrapnel flew in front of the British and French churches, causing many civilian casualties. The people of Shantou are now evacuating in large numbers every day.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shantou] At 8:00 a.m. on the 4th, eight × planes flying from Minxia passed over Chenghai North and South Ports and invaded Shantou City at 8:30. First, they strafed the city center with dense machine gun fire, and then they threw large bombs randomly at Wubridge. The rumbling sounds, coupled with the gunfire, plunged the city into a state of terror. Rescue teams and ambulances bravely ventured into the rain of bombs to carry out rescue operations. The reporter also went to the disaster area to inspect amidst the air raid alarm. He witnessed 27 bombs falling on Wubridge. Imposing buildings instantly became ruined walls and broken tiles, and the shacks of the poor were also reduced to ashes, leaving them nowhere to turn. Among them, many wives died and children were killed. The scene was so tragic that it was heartbreaking. The × planes did not leave Shantou until after 11:00 a.m., and they spied on Chaoan, Jieyang, and Chaoyang in batches, and strafed the Ancheung Electric Ship at Longdu, Raoping, killing and injuring more than 20 passengers. In Jieyang, they strafed the Jie Shantou Electric Ship, injuring one crew member. As for the disaster sites in Shantou, it is estimated that more than a hundred buildings, including Wubridge Tongji Straight Road Lower Section, Tongji Third Road Upper Section, Beiti Road Tongji Second Heng Lane entire lane, machine storage houses, and civilian houses, were destroyed. More than 20 civilians were killed and injured. After the × planes bombed wildly, Shantou and Chaoan, Jieyang, Chaoyang and other counties stepped up the evacuation of the population and set up refugee reception stations in various places to urge the people to evacuate. Shantou's various circles also established shelters for poor children and female workers to accommodate those who are unable to escape and the homeless, providing food and lodging. When a considerable number of people are accommodated, they will be escorted to the Shaosheng Women's Production Work Group and the Provincial Children's Training Corps for upbringing. At 12:30 p.m., the batch of × planes, consisting of several planes, came again in formation to attack, flying low and strafing wantonly. Our air defense forces met them head-on with a heavy blow. Until after 1:00 p.m., they threw more than ten bombs in the Island Bridge area again, destroying dozens of houses and killing and injuring more than 20 civilians again. A bomb was also dropped at the intersection of Shengping Road, but it fell into the sea. After wreaking havoc, they turned to attack Chaoyang Chenghai. At the same time, two × warships, one destroyer, and several motorboats suddenly appeared in Linghai. We are closely monitoring them.</p>
<h3>Xinhe × Changed from Attack to Defense, Our Army Advanced and Forced the Meeting City, Peeking at Danshuikou × Has Been Repelled, The Situation Has Eased, The Four Districts Blockhouses Decided to Demolish and Prepare for Resolute Resistance</h3>
<p>[Express News from Zhongshan] In the Xin (Hui) He (Shan) battle, our army has been fighting fiercely in recent days in the areas of Jinggen Nanzhuang Road on the Xinhe Road, Pingdiling, and Fenshui River, Da Xiaomei on the Xinkai Road. Our army's teams are advancing very quickly. × Attempted to launch a pincer attack on Kaiping Danshuikou from He City and Hui City, but the treacherous plot has been foiled. The various situations are as follows:</p>
<p>Our Army Launches Three-Pronged Attack</p>
<p>After our army launched a counterattack on He Shan × from Kaiping and Gaoming, × retreated to the areas of Shapogubu and Haikou. One route of our army is now advancing towards Shaping from Yangmei Jinggangxu. The Xinhe Road our army is advancing from Ziwu. The fighting at Nanzhuang Station and Pingdiling has been very fierce in recent days, and our army has made considerable progress, killing many. The Xinkai Road our army has also advanced to Fenshui River, approaching Hui City, and the fighting is quite fierce. × Has a look of abandoning Da Xiaomei. × In Hui City is extremely panicked because our Guifeng Mountain team is in control.</p>
<p>Danshuikou Has Been Lifted from Martial Law</p>
<p>× Boats once harassed Xinkai border roads a few days ago and landed once in Danshuikou, but were repelled by our garrison team. Recently, they still peek at the same time and use small-caliber cannons and machine guns to strafe the shore. Danshuikou was extremely tense. After He City was lost, × There was a trend of invading along Kaihe. Now, because the teams from all directions are effectively blocking ×, the tense situation in Danshuikou has eased. On the 3rd of this month, Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First District, ordered the Danshuikou team to lift martial law.</p>
<p>The First District Supervises the Demolition of Blockhouses</p>
<p>Gu Dinghua, the administrative inspector of the First District, was ordered by Zhang Fakui, the commander of the ×th war zone, and Li Hanhun, the chairman of the provincial government, to strictly supervise the demolition of blockhouses in various villages in the Four Districts and to step up war preparations. It was found that the public in the Four Districts had previously petitioned to exempt them from demolition, but after Bai Chongxi, the director of the Southwest Headquarters, telegraphed an explanation of the intention of the demolition, the authorities specifically ordered the First District to supervise the demolition to show their determination to resist the war and not to be used by the enemy.</p>
<p>Xinhe × Changed to Defensive Stance</p>
<p>According to the electric report from the Guerrilla Headquarters of the ×th District of Xin Hui, the × at the strongholds of Shaping Jiangmen He City in Xin Zeng He Shan were afraid of our counterattack and actively built defensive fortifications on the foreign line. According to the electric telephone report from the Guerrilla Headquarters of the ×th District of Xin Hui, the × in Hui City erected artillery positions in the Dongmen Shizi Market Shatiqiao area. More than 300 × in Shaping also have a look of preparing to retreat.</p>
<h3>The Provincial Party Headquarters Adjusted the Organization, and the Organizational Content of Each Department Was Revised</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Shaoguan) Since the reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, Chairman Li Hanhun has been actively engaged in rectification. In addition to telegraphing the Central Committee to urge the new members who have not yet reported to the department and those who have not yet taken office to report to the department as soon as possible, he also revised the previous rules of procedure and followed the regulations of the Central Committee, abolishing the original inspection system to avoid duplication of work with the district supervision. The departments under the Organization, Civil Training, Propaganda, and General Affairs Departments were divided into groups. Under the General Affairs Department, there are four groups: Documents, Affairs, Accounting, and Cashier. Under the Organization Department, there are three groups: Guidance, Investigation, and Party Membership. Under the Propaganda Department, there are three groups: Guidance, Compilation, and Review. Under the Civil Training Department, there are three groups: Review, Guidance, and Social Affairs. In addition, because the original personnel were insufficient for distribution, personnel are being adjusted and enriched to increase work efficiency.</p>
<h3>The National Production Conference Opened, Guangdong Province's Wartime Agricultural Plan (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(5) Thoroughly Reform Rural Cooperatives</p>
<p>The establishment of rural cooperatives was originally intended to help farmers and run rural undertakings to avoid being manipulated by others and suffering losses. Cooperatives aim to manage one or more related businesses, so there are certain restrictions. According to their nature, they can be divided into credit, supply, production, transportation and sales, consumption, public utilities, insurance, and other types. Rural cooperatives have long been established in this province, but in reality, the masters are indeed others, not the farmers themselves. The crux of the problem is obvious. If it is not thoroughly reformed, what benefits the farmers may actually harm them, and only give another class an opportunity to exploit them.</p>
<p>(6) Rapidly Establish Rural Warehouses</p>
<p>Grain regulation is extremely important in peacetime, and even more urgent in wartime. In order to coordinate production and sales and ensure proper supply, it is urgent to build warehouses and promote warehouse operations. The Guangdong authorities should immediately select suitable locations that are farther from the war zone and have convenient transportation. The provincial government or county government should establish warehouses to handle transportation, sales, storage, and mortgage business, in order to regulate production and sales and store grain. With preparations, the farmer economy can be compensated. The Ministry of Economic Affairs formulated the "Emergency Period Feed and Grain Storage Implementation Measures" on September 24 last year, and promulgated them by ministerial order on September 20 last year for local governments to follow. In order to implement storage, mortgage loans, Guangdong should be established quickly, so that not only can the problem of grain panic be partially solved, but also the farmer's life can be gradually improved.</p>
<p>(7) Develop Immigration and Reclamation Undertakings</p>
<p>Reclamation is the best way to support the long-term war of resistance, increase production, and provide relief to refugees. According to the draft outline of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association's plan for refugee relief, the provincial authorities plan to select Nanshan in the Eastern District, Lianshan in the Northern District, and Xinyu in the Western District as immigration and reclamation areas. Based on 12,000 households, with five people per household, approximately 640,000 mu of land can be reclaimed. The management method will adopt a collective farm system in order to make the work reasonable, etc. I believe that in this urgent situation, when it comes to reclamation, the principles of time, economy, and cost savings should be followed. Being too idealistic will make it difficult to implement. The first thing to pay attention to in immigration and reclamation is the location and the fertility of the land. The location should be closer to the refugee area and belong to a safe zone. The soil should be hot wasteland, otherwise it is necessary to select the more fertile soil to avoid futile efforts. In order to accelerate the development of immigration and reclamation undertakings, the provincial government must supervise the county governments to be responsible for handling them to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>(8) Promote Short-Term Crops</p>
<p>The province's food supply is insufficient. In peacetime, it can still rely on imported goods, but in wartime, the seaports are blocked, transportation is difficult, and foreign rice is difficult to supply. Moreover, the Guangzhou Pearl River Delta area has become a war zone, and the area for planting rice has been greatly reduced. All crops that can provide food should be expanded. In wartime, the gains and losses of a place or a city are inevitable. All long-term crops that require a long period of cultivation before harvest are unlikely to be planted. Therefore, in order to adapt to environmental needs, short-term crops should be actively promoted. Not only can it reduce the worry of being ravaged and destroyed by the × people, but also it can be harvested in a short period of time for supply. Guangdong mostly relies on foreign rice, but the output is insufficient. Therefore, it should use mature and sloping land to widely plant beans and other miscellaneous grains according to the local climate and soil to reduce the consumption of rice. As for excellent dry rice, it can also be planted in moderation according to the local environment. If the supply and demand can be equal, it is desirable. Otherwise, the amount of difference can be improved again, and it can be hoped to be offset.</p>
<p>(9) Promote Wartime Rural Education</p>
<p>The development of rural areas depends on the popularization of rural education. The second phase of the war of resistance is the prelude to completing the building of a national defense. All rural education facilities should be aimed at wartime needs, using the natural environment to concentrate forces and train the people, so that every citizen is a sound production element. We should also universally set up lower-level agricultural vocational schools, short-term wartime peasant schools, and organize wartime agricultural extension service groups, wartime rural education service groups, etc., to train talents and provide mobile services to seek popularization, and use all production plans as their concrete teaching materials to ensure that production and education are integrated. At any time, use the effectively managed public and private farms as the base for implementing education.</p>
<p>(10) The Contribution of the National Production Conference to the Province</p>
<p>Modern warfare is a final between countries' human, material and financial resources. Its economic and material capabilities can provide lasting supply and ultimately win the victory. President Kong of the Executive Yuan attaches great importance to and strives to promote national production work and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. In addition to establishing the China Industrial Cooperative Association and the Agricultural Products Promotion Committee to assist the provinces and promote production undertakings in a blitzkrieg manner, he is also afraid that this kind of work is limited to the local area and has not been developed evenly. In order to conduct a general review of the national production undertaking, in order to establish a whole plan and facilitate progress, the National Production Conference was convened. Regarding the preparations for the conference, President Kong sent Mr. Mu Ouchu, a well-experienced and prestigious agricultural and industrial expert, to serve as the secretary of the conference and preside over everything. The province should follow the regulations of the Central Committee and send more representatives to attend and make practical suggestions so that, with the technical and economic assistance of the Central Committee, the province's agricultural plan can be completed. The above ten items are the main points, and they are listed to be the guidelines for reform. As for the implementation plan details, it is still necessary to carefully stipulate that all regions of Guangdong Province are suitable for the planting of tea and sugarcane. If the environment can be used to the full extent, the prospects for the tea and sugar industries are infinitely promising. For example, sloping mountains can also be afforested on a large scale, and tung oil can be planted extensively in the areas bordering Hunan Province. During this time of war of resistance, nurseries should be set up first to avoid wasting human and material resources. After the victory of the war of resistance, planting them widely can save time and money. All of these should be given special attention. Attached is an imperial and to wake up the attention of the general public. (End)</p>
<h3>Acting Commander Zhang Returned to Northern Guangdong Yesterday, Summoned Party, Government, and Military Commanders for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] Zhang Fakui, the acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, returned to Northern Guangdong yesterday (5th) after inspecting various places in Northeast Jiang.

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Relief Association Handles Ping Tiao in Xijiang, Allocates 20,000 Yuan to Be Supervised by the Commissioner</h3>
<p>(Express News from Qujiang) Since the × Kou invaded the south, the rice-producing areas of this province, such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zengcheng, have been successively ravaged, resulting in extreme shortages of food in the mainland, extremely high prices, and great suffering for the people, especially in the counties of Xijiang. The Guangdong Provincial Relief Association has successively received telegrams from Director Bai of the Gui Xingying and Acting Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee, instructing them to quickly find ways to provide relief. The relief association believes that the shortage of food in the counties of Xijiang during this time of shortage is a serious problem, and the method of relief should be to immediately organize Ping Tiao to stabilize rice prices and enrich the people's livelihood. It has already prepared several measures and submitted them to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday, the 27th, it allocated 20,000 yuan to Commissioner Li of the Third District to supervise the implementation of Ping Tiao in the food-deficient counties together with Commander Deng, and ordered them to report the amount of food shortage in each county, the current rice prices, and the methods of organizing Ping Tiao for review. As for the method of allocating and transporting food, it will be ordered after proper consultation.</p>

<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>Hollywood's New Trend: Biographies are Very Popular, New Films are Being Made One After Another</h3>
<p>Recently, biographical films have become very popular, probably due to the outstanding success of films such as "The Life of Emile Zola," "Juarez," "Victoria the Great," and "The Great Waltz." The following eleven films have been statistically compiled:</p>
<p>Tyrone Power's "Jesse James," an American outlaw, has already been filmed, co-starring Henry Fonda and Nancy Kelly, in full color. The Castles, a couple, Frayre Stan and Qin Shulojis, were the most popular dance partners in the United States twenty years ago. Irene Castle (the wife) is forty-five years old this year and serves as the storyline consultant for the film. Her husband died in a plane crash during the European War. This is Astan Rogis' first historical film, and it has already been filmed.</p>
<p>Paul Muni's "Juarez," a Mexican hero, is a historical war film, co-starring Bette Davis, handsome young man Byron Anaheim, character actor John Garfield, Claude Rains, and others. The cast is very strong and is currently in production.</p>
<p>"Stanley and Livingstone," two people's African adventures, triggered the great powers' invasion of Africa.

<h3>Husband, Wife, Friend (4)</h3>
<p>Leopold hoped he could get people to sign business contracts as easily as he could sell tickets. Business was not good. In fact, there was no business at all. He didn't tell Doris. They could only live off the savings in the bank. Of course, this couldn't last long.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, his apartment was like a madhouse. The concert was scheduled to begin at two o'clock. Doris was putting on makeup in her room. The room was crowded with girls and friends. There was also Mrs. White. Leopold himself was holding a pair of tuxedo pants and spinning around, trying to find a place to change. Outside the room, Xu Guo was sitting on a small piano waiting for Doris's reply, occasionally playing a note or two on the piano.</p>
<p>"Mi Mi Mi…!" Doris was earnestly applying makeup.</p>
<p>People made a lot of noise for a while. Doris said, "That's terrible! He has to come! I need him more than anyone in the world! Leopold! Louise Bronson got Rudolf Hertz to agree to give me a review! But she told him the wrong date."</p>
<p>"Who is Rudolf Hertz?" Leopold asked in celebration. He finally put on his pants.</p>
<p>Miss White replied, "The most famous music critic in the national newspapers."</p>
<p>Doris said, "Getting a good review from him is more valuable than anything! His phone is private, we don't know the number, so we can't call him. Leopold, can you go see him in person? We heard he's not at the office, he's at his own home. Leopold, I beg you!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, okay," Leopold replied quickly. He didn't agree with this suggestion at all. But of course he hoped the concert would be a success.</p>
<p>He arrived at Hertz's house and found the stubborn Hertz having lunch with his wife and a beautiful Miss Carver. He learned from the conversation that she was a singer. Hertz declined, saying that he had another appointment and couldn't come. But Miss Carver looked at Leopold with sympathy for his difficulties and said that she might be able to come to the concert in a while.</p>
<p>Leopold returned dejectedly to the Town Hall. When he entered the concert hall, the music had already begun. Doris was standing on stage, clenching her fists in fear. There wasn't an empty seat in the audience. She sang a section from "Carmen" reasonably well. Well, let her succeed, and she'll be satisfied. He patiently waited for her to sing the last note, for the last basket of flowers to be sent to the stage, and for the last applause to gradually stop. Then he went to her dressing room backstage.</p>
<p>The backstage was full of talk, laughter, and praise. Leopold squeezed through and embraced Doris when he saw her. She asked happily, "How was it?"</p>
<p>He said, "Honey, you won, it was great. How about we leave here and celebrate?"</p>

<h3>Public Baseball Opening Game Today, Friends Beer vs. Portuguese Army, Held at Caroline Hill at 2:30 PM</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Recently, in all kinds of ball games on the island, the Chinese have been winning and reporting great news. Fans are happy to spend money.</p>
<p>Five of the six major football championships have been won. The name has been obtained, but it is unknown how the benefits are. In the lawn tennis singles and doubles matches, it looks like it will be our world again.</p>
<p>Football has waned, and tennis is at the final stage. The baseball game, which was born in this environment, will "open grandly" today.</p>
<p>If there is something to say, it is long; if there is nothing to say, it is short. Speaking of baseball in Hong Kong, although it is not as popular as football, there are still many people who promote it. However, the reason why baseball is not very developed in Hong Kong is that baseball is an American product. Some people with ulterior motives say, "Sports also look at color."</p>
<p>Tired of watching football, today baseball is newly launched, just right to change the taste.</p>
<p>The opening game, the Chinese team has not yet shown its face, but it is the Westerners playing the Friends Beer team. As far as I know, these two teams are also evenly matched.</p>
<p>The Portuguese army was the runner-up in the last session and has many famous players, such as Da Gaoshanu, Biludu, Palala, A Luwiki, etc., who are good materials for football and good baseball players. However, Da Gao and Biludu are currently on a southern expedition and have not returned. Since the team is incomplete, they must be careful to maintain the runner-up prestige when playing the first battle.</p>
<p>The Friends Beer team is a mixed army, that is, the incarnation of the Volunteer Army of the previous session, with good players such as the Li Anna brothers and Shi Yun. The strength is quite good, so don't underestimate them.</p>
<p>The battle location is at the Caroline Hill Naval Ground (ie, the place below the South China Association Ground). The stands have been built and can accommodate five or six hundred people. There are now many idle classes in Hong Kong. It is believed that the baseball market will also be booming.</p>
<p>Don't forget that the opening game time today is at 2:30 PM. Tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM, the defending champion Chinese team will play the US ship Mindanao. This big battle will definitely have more to watch. Tell the general baseball fans not to miss the time tomorrow morning. (The Ground God of Baseball) has learned that the lineups of the two teams playing today are as follows:</p>
<p>Western Association</p>
<p>(Pitcher) Palala, (Catcher) A Aluchengshi, (First Base) Balos, (Second Base) Mentusha, (Shortstop) Bright, (Third Base) Aluvic, (Left Field) L Aluvic, (Center Field) Ma Kishi, (Right Field) Fiba Lido, (Reserves) Budiro, Gavilo,</p>
<p>Friends Beer Team</p>
<p>(Pitcher) Xia Gaoli, (Catcher) Rongli, (First Base) — Li Annana, (Second Base) Susha, (Shortstop) Li Anna, (Third Base) Bonio, (Left Field) Xia Xian, (Center Field) Ao Xia Gaoli, (Right Field) Bao Yun, (Reserves) Ali, Duck Abbas, A Linzhen,</p>

<p>[Associated Press, 4th] The Hong Kong team played against the local VGO team last night. There were 8,000 spectators. Liang Rongzhao scored a goal within ten minutes of the start of the game. Since then, both sides have gained nothing. Hong Kong won 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Not long after the start of the second half, Gao Shanu scored a goal. Then YCO returned a goal. Fifteen minutes later, Gao Shanu scored again. In the end, Da Gao scored again five minutes later. As a result, the Hong Kong team won 4-1. Li Huitang did not play. (Note: This telegram was sent at 2:30 AM the night before, but this newspaper was unable to publish it due to rushing to print. It is supplemented today.)</p>
<h3>Good Show at Happy Valley Tomorrow, Eastern vs. Australian League, Australian Team Arrives by Ship Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>At this time, when the ball game is dwindling and the inter-port team has not returned from the expedition, there will be a football game worth watching at the Hong Kong venue tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM. That is the Eastern Association, the runner-up of the First Division League, will face the All-Australian League team.</p>
<p>Tickets are divided into three types: one yuan, five jiao, and three jiao. The door will open at 3:00 PM to avoid crowding.</p>
<p>The lineups of the two teams have been announced before, and the strengths are equal. It will definitely be a fierce battle. The All-Australian League team is personally led by Mr. Miro, the secretary of the Macau Football Association. They will arrive at 11:15 AM tomorrow morning. The Eastern Association will treat them courteously. The lineup on the field is:</p>
<p>Jia Hualu, Luo Bardo, He Zuosheng, Ke Tuohua, Ya Luoshi, Susha, Xiao Luobishi, Ya Mailang, Gao Lasu, Li Gu</p>
<p>Reserves: Liu Diqing, Ba Dalaigo,</p>
<p>Jia Hualu is known as the Iron Hand of Macau. His skills in saving and kneeling are unique. He Zuosheng is well-built, has strong headers, and is fast on his feet. Luo Bardo is a famous inter-port player. He has shown his skills when he came to Hong Kong last year. Center-back Ya Luoshi is also a famous player with the style of "Ga Xu" in Shanghai. He plays smoothly. The two full-backs are known for their bravery. The forward line, Gao Lasu, is the most dangerous. The left winger Luo Bishi is cunning and lively, and the right winger is agile. The left and right centers have always had contact. This team can use triangular short passes and long passes to the two wings when attacking. They are fast and beautiful to watch. They have been practicing hard recently, and the Eastern team may not be able to cope with them easily.</p>
<p>After several days of consultation, the Eastern Association has arranged the lineup as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Liu Xianhan, Zeng Zhongyun, Jiang Shanjing, Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizan, Yu Qiaxing, Zou Wenzhi, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtujian</p>
<p>Reserves: Xu Buyun, Miao Huaguo, Li Bingzhu</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing has returned this time, and the connection with Brother Heng and Ah Niu (Zhongyun) will definitely be further improved. The three midfielders are seamless. They can attack and defend. Jingcheng's seemingly attacking but not attacking, and suddenly shooting fiercely, will definitely show more color on this field. The right side of the forward line has been matched and is familiar with each other. They know themselves and their opponents. Zou Wenzhi is serving the Eastern Association again, and he is familiar with the road. Yu Qiaxing has improved recently and can also assist in building attacks. If he is brave enough, he will be looked at with new eyes.</p>
<p>I believe that the Eastern attack should be assisted by the midfielders, assisting the forward. When defending, the two inside axles should also be organized to defend. Suddenly, a surprise soldier suddenly appeared (this is what the Eastern team is good at), and the great work will be accomplished.</p>
<p>Macau's football skills have improved rapidly in recent years. The inter-port competition has advanced from Group B to Group A, and tomorrow's competition is also one of the balances of Macau's football skills.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Competition Registration Deadline Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Federation held a meeting a few days ago on the Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Competition, and it was decided to hold it as soon as possible. Registration has begun, and the participants have been very enthusiastic recently. Now the Federation has set the registration deadline for 6:00 PM tomorrow (7th). Teams that have not registered can go to the business department of Sing Tao Newspaper in Central to fill out the registration form.</p>
<h3>Basketball Tonight, Group A Zhong Sheng vs. Police, Group B Ling Ying vs. Chen Guang, Hua Nan vs. Kang Yuan</h3>
<p>The schedule for the Public Men's Basketball Tournament tonight has been slightly changed. The first game is at 6:30 PM, Group B, Ling Ying vs. Chen Guang. The second game is at 7:30 PM, Group A, Zhong Sheng vs. Police. The third game is at 8:30 PM, Group B, Hua Nan vs. Kang Yuan. In the Group A match, Zhong Sheng is a strong team in this tournament and is unusually strong. The police are slightly inferior and should not be their opponent. In Group B, Ling Ying has stronger combat power than Chen Guang and may win. South China should beat Kang Yuan.</p>
<h3>Philippine Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— —Huitang—</p>
<p>April 28, Rough Waves</p>
<p>I was awakened by the bell for breakfast on the boat in the early morning. I looked at my watch and it was already 8:00. Although I hadn't slept enough, I勉力 to get up. I asked Mr. Liang to get up and have breakfast together. When I entered the dining room, I learned that the boat was unloading cargo and had actually been delayed until 6:00 this morning before setting sail. Looking at the sea from the small window, dark clouds were everywhere, and small waves were raging. The waves were splashing, and the boat was pitching up and down. Rongxi, Jun Gan, Er Hou, Kenny, and Biludu all fell ill and couldn't get up. By noon, the tremors were even worse, and even the Zhaorong, Da Gao, and Shi Han, who had been eating peacefully, couldn't resist and disappeared one after another. Only I, Zao Ru, Jing Xiang, Tiansheng, A Chi, and Jian Jin were seen eating both lunch and dinner. Everyone else was hiding in their cabins, unable to move. Rongzhao and Rongsheng even clutched their chests and vomited, suffering from seasickness more than a major illness. In fact, the waves were not big at all. I have traveled back and forth across the South China Sea fourteen times, and this time was actually quieter. It is a pity that my friends still could not avoid the pain of vomiting and groaning. Sailing is a blessing, and I consider myself to be blessed and lucky. During dinner, an American clerk told me in great detail about the Chinese situation, which surprised me with his deep and outstanding knowledge. He said that since the beginning of China's resistance against Japan, it has gained the sympathy of the labor community in his country. He himself admires General Zhu De the most, in addition to President Chiang and his wife, and said that if we can persevere to the end, the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. Even foreigners have this kind of belief, so how can we be willing to give up? Justice has not been extinguished, and those cruel invaders can also be alerted! At 9:00 PM, the boat entertained the public with sound movies. Less than half of our team was able to enjoy the visual feast, which is also a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>April 29, Destination</p>
<p>Yesterday, most people were troubled by the waves, their spirits were sluggish, and they did not have enough sleep. I thought to myself, if we still suffer this misfortune today, then we can hardly escape a defeat in tomorrow night's competition. I was anxiously thinking about it, and it lingered in my dreams. Even I tossed and turned, keeping my eyes open all night. Fortunately, the sun shone brightly this morning, and the sea was as flat as a mirror. When I got up early, I saw my friends leaving their cabins one after another. Even Er Hou and Rongzhao, who were not well, also tidied up their clothes and went to the dining room to eat ravenously, hoping to make up for their previous losses. Team leader A Chi had a happy expression on his face and announced that he would go to the deck for a drink after breakfast to celebrate the reunion of the entire team. The laughter was mixed and no longer as boring as yesterday. The boat was raising its sails to cross the strait. The original plan to arrive at the destination in the morning had to be postponed to 4:00 PM. The Philippine Federation sent a telegram saying that they had contacted the customs and would inspect the luggage when the boat entered the port to save time at the customs. At around 5:00 PM, Little Luzon was already faintly visible. Two small boats, the doctor and the customs, successively approached the boat and went through the entry inspection procedures as usual. By the time we docked, it was already evening. There were many people welcoming us at the pier. Dr. Yilan Neng, the secretary of the Philippine Federation, Philippine team leader Jia Lianghe, Hong Kong referee Omar, my friend Mr. Lin Guang, a sports enthusiast, Philippine football players, and many Chinese and Western newspaper reporters. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings and taking many flash photos, we went ashore together. I thought to myself, after five years of separation, the peach blossoms are still the same, and I feel sad that white hair is urging people on. I have been to 岷 before and after eight times since the 12th year of the Republic of China. I took a car to the Hatol Luneta Hotel and hurriedly changed my clothes. Then I went to the football field to try the taste of electric lights. The field is located in the Rizal Staluim, the venue for the 10th Far Eastern Games. Its magnificent structure is comparable only to our former city center field in the Far East. There are 41 electric lights on the left side of the field and only 12 on the right side, so the left side is bright and the right side is dark, and the light is not evenly distributed. However, if you are not short-sighted, you can follow the ball as you wish. After practicing for an hour, I went to the Ai Qiu Hotel for food. I hadn't had Chinese food for a long time, so my stomach was wide open. When I took a bath and went to bed, I unconsciously reported midnight. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Popularize School Physical Education - Popular Classes Should Be Added</h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(I) Encouraging students' efforts in physical education classes, addressing the past bad habits of general students, viewing physical education as a casual and leisurely course, and the time spent in physical education classes as opportunities for laziness. Because regular classes are too restrictive, everyone wants to find opportunities for laughter and free activities during physical education. Therefore, physical education teachers who casually let students do as they please in class are the most popular among students. If a teacher is too serious, students will dislike them, and in schools with student unrest, it will incite student movements and lead to teachers being expelled. When I first left student life and took a teaching position, I was unaware of the school's atmosphere. Relying on a passionate desire for physical education reform, I implemented strict and forceful physical education methods, not allowing students any freedom. This turned me into an adversary of the students. No matter how I encouraged them, the students' resentment never subsided and worsened daily, until they petitioned the headmaster to dismiss me. Fortunately, the principal convened a school assembly (the principal gathered all the students on the playground for instruction and invited me to speak) where, with unwavering spirit, forceful tactics, and righteous arguments, I persuaded the students, and the matter was immediately resolved. Afterward, classes proceeded smoothly. After this incident, I gained a lot of experience and my resolve strengthened. From this, I learned that the general tendency of students towards casualness and laziness is not fixed, but can be changed and corrected. It depends on whether the teacher can firmly uphold their rational views. Therefore, in general schools, adding physical education popular classes can reduce a lot of trouble. On the one hand, it can eliminate students' disregard for physical education, and on the other hand, it can encourage their efforts in physical education classes—because if they don't work hard in regular classes, they can be assigned to popular classes for training. This will elicit a response from them, making them realize that their physique is inferior to others, and prompting them to think about working harder in the future. Therefore, popular classes can indeed encourage students to work hard in class and eliminate all past bad habits and correct past negative attitudes.</p>
<p>(II) Enhancing the willingness of students' parents to provide physical training for their children. The traditional Chinese emphasis on literature and disdain for martial arts, the weak literary atmosphere, have deeply influenced people's minds. Despite decades of promoting physical education, many still look down on it, believing that scholars should be quiet and studious, not jumping and running around. They often quote "not peeking into the garden for three years" to admonish their children. This situation is even more pronounced in Hong Kong. How do I know this? It's not a lie. Since arriving in Hong Kong, I have often received leave requests from students' parents. Even though their children are capable of physical training, they make up trivial excuses to avoid it, to ensure their children don't get tanned or injured, which is needless worrying and a short-sighted approach. This is a major reason why China's physical education has lagged behind. To correct their thinking, guide them, and increase their willingness to provide physical training for their children, besides other methods, the most effective is popular classes. Because popular classes are specialized training for their children's health, a direct demonstration that is most suitable for their children's needs. Indirectly, it shows that their children lack physical training and are physically weak, so they need to join the class. Therefore, all of this will catch their attention, give them a big stimulus and a profound response. After the training, their children's physique will be better than before, giving them a thorough understanding. Gradually, this can change their disregard for physical training. (End of Part Two)</p>

<h3>The Troubles of the Aggressor</h3>
<p>— Written by Ze Lieqing, Translated by Cai Yunteng</p>
<p>The Twofold Difficulties Recognized by the Japanese</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War has fallen into a prolonged state, two anxieties have been hanging over our (Japanese) hearts. The first is the domestic economic problem, and the second is international relations. Currently, the joint pressure exerted on Japan by Britain, the United States, and France has become an obvious fact.</p>
<p>First, let us discuss the domestic economic problem. This problem is more important than any other. We can understand how much money the war requires simply by observing the huge national budget!</p>
<p>Normally, Japan is already very short of raw materials. The large quantities of materials used in the war must rely even more on foreign countries. Gasoline, cotton, and iron almost all depend on foreign imports. Moreover, foreign imports must be paid for in cash. However, Japan's national treasury funds are limited, and of course, it must rely on export earnings to pay for imports. Although this method is correct in principle for the national economy and personal economy, the income from Japanese exports is entirely the blood and sweat of the people.</p>
<p>In this war, we have no choice but to buy all kinds of goods from foreign countries, but the number of Japanese goods exported is very small. The reason for this is that Japanese goods are expensive, the prices of exports are too high, and foreigners mostly hate Japan and do not buy Japanese goods. If we rely solely on the cash earned from exporting Japanese goods to buy foreign goods, it goes without saying that it is a drop in the bucket. As the war drags on, we must buy all kinds of things from abroad. What will happen then? Will we continue to pay in cash? Will we borrow from abroad? Or will we not buy foreign goods at all? In past wars, Japan could still borrow from foreign countries, but this time that path is blocked. We only have the option of continuing to pay in cash, but paying in cash, given Japan's economic strength today, has already reached a point of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Once outside, one can see the lack of goods everywhere. Buses and jitney cars are restricted, which is due to the shortage of gasoline. Because of the iron shortage, even the street mailboxes have been replaced with smaller ones. Cotton products and absorbent cotton are also insufficient due to the interruption of imports. As the war continues, materials will become increasingly depleted.</p>
<p>Secondly—regarding international problems, it is extremely difficult to be optimistic. Currently, Japan is paying attention to six countries: Germany, Italy, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Among these six countries, Germany and Italy are Japan's fellow sufferers, which everyone knows. However, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have taken an offensive stance against Japan, especially the three countries Britain, the United States, and France, which have been constantly discussing steps to sanction Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's fishery problem with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union did not agree to Japan's request. If Japan really wants to fish freely, there are submarines and airplanes over there, which is not a game. Now Japan does not trust the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union does not trust Japan, so a shadow has been cast over the feelings of the two countries. However, international issues must be judged and resolved based on the magnitude of the event itself.</p>
<p>Recently, there are two actions of Japan in China that need to be noted. The first is Japan's occupation of Hainan Island. Hainan Island is separated from Taiwan by a narrow strip of water. It is located between Hong Kong and Singapore, and the island is rich in resources. In the future, Japan will advance into Southeast Asia. From a strategic point of view, it is an important military base. This has caused anxiety to Britain, the United States, and France, making them more concerned about the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The second is the continuous assassinations in the Shanghai concession. There are two concessions in Shanghai, one is the International Settlement, which is the same as the foreign settlements in Kobe and Yokohama forty years ago, and the other is the French Concession. These two concessions are the main bases for Chinese people in Shanghai to resist Japan. In February, assassinations occurred frequently. On February 19, Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the puppet "Reformed Government," and on the 21st, Li Guojie, a pro-Japanese figure, were assassinated in the concession. This anti-Japanese phenomenon among the Chinese is undoubtedly a reflection of the anti-Japanese sentiment of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Regarding this matter, Japan convened a meeting of the highest-ranking officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy. As a result, they demanded that the concession increase the number of Japanese police officers.</p>
<p>The most hateful country now is the United States. The United States refuses to sell airplanes to Japan, but is willing to sell them to France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the movement to prohibit the sale of oil and iron scrap to Japan is also surging. The budget for expanding armaments, especially the air force, in the Pacific region has also been announced. From this, it can be seen that the United States' offensive against Japan is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Because Britain and France are encountering many events in Europe, it seems difficult to directly pressure Japan. Instead, they have turned to providing economic aid to China. The United States has lent 80 million yuan to China, and Britain has lent 10 million yuan. Furthermore, pilots from these countries have come to China in their individual capacities to participate in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Why do Britain, the United States, and France have consistent interests? They believe that Japan's exclusive occupation of China is driving out their rights and interests in China. Previously, the Nine-Power Treaty stipulated respect for China's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and the open door policy. Japan was also one of the signatory countries at the Washington Conference. However, last year, Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Arita issued a statement: "The situation in the Far East is completely different today. Japan cannot abide by the treaty now." Therefore, Britain, the United States, and France felt that Japan was breaking the treaty and successively lodged protests. The content of the protests was roughly the same, indicating that the three countries were taking consistent steps.</p>
<p>In summary, international relations with Japan have become very bad, but this is not just a problem for Japan alone. On one hand, it is the alliance between Japan and Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, it is the alliance between Britain, the United States, and France, considering the outbreak of a future Second World War.</p>
<p>Therefore, the world problem centered on China and Japan should be studied and resolved with an extremely calm attitude.</p>
<p>Spring is spreading warmth across the earth, and green buds are sprouting on the treetops. However, the people of the world are still living a life that goes against nature.</p>

<h3>The Art of Pulling</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>To give without return is impolite; thus: to push without pulling is unprofitable. Moreover, pushing is a passive action that prevents problems before they happen and removes troubles after they occur, unlike pulling, which pulls everything that is beneficial to oneself, a truly thorough active action. Therefore, pulling is to pushing as the wolf is to the lame wolf, inseparable, and also has independent value, especially that one must learn!</p>
<p>The primary skill in pulling is naturally pulling people. For example, if you want to become an official, you must learn to pull strings. The items for pulling strings include: inviting people to eat, go sightseeing, play, worshiping as a teacher; climbing in-laws, recognizing a godfather; recognizing fellow villagers, classmates, recognizing old friendships; sending gifts; paying respects at the yamen; taking the inner line through the senior wife, junior wife, sisters, or any woman... Each item, when studied carefully, can become a dedicated book: nothing is difficult in the world for a willing mind. I will not mention it here.</p>
<p>If you want to make a fortune, you must learn to pull directors. Because the quickest way to make a fortune, apart from becoming an official, is to run a company, open a store, or organize a factory. These avenues, as long as you can pull the first-class directors who are wealthy and reputable, the second-class directors who are wealthy but have no reputation, and the third-class directors who have no wealth but have a reputation, they will elect you as manager, open a branch company, a branch store, or a branch factory, and make you general manager, and you can make a fortune. If the company develops and is profitable, of course, you can make a fortune. Even if it doesn't develop, or even loses money or goes bankrupt, you can still make a fortune. Fishing in troubled waters has always been a secret skill passed down, and it is a fixed formula for shareholders to go bankrupt and managers or general managers to eat their fill.</p>
<p>Besides pulling directors, pulling shareholders is also important, but if you have directors above to rally, shareholders will respond to the news, and there will be no problem.</p>
<p>If you say that directors are elected by shareholders, how can they be pulled? Then I want to say to you: Foolish child, you cannot be taught! You must study hard! Because elections are just a formality, pulling is reality!</p>
<p>Recently, besides opening companies, etc., as a way to make a fortune, some people have the unconventional idea that running a school is also a good way to make money. Therefore, you must work hard to learn the art of pulling in running a school.</p>
<p>First, you must also know how to pull directors. The qualifications of the directors are the same as those of companies, etc. Second, you must know how to pull teachers: you must pull red teachers who are able to attract students, and you must especially pull black teachers who are able to work hard and be thrifty, help me make a fortune, be selfless and devoted to public service, and do not think of laying their hands on it. Third, you must know how to pull students: the principle is to accept all comers, the more the better; our school has thirty-six subjects, all of which are available, catering to students' various needs as a slogan; or advertise in the newspaper or put up posters, or distribute leaflets, or even hire runners or brokers as a means.</p>
<p>It is said that the principal is a leader in the cultural world. In our country, which values literature, the reputation is slightly better than that of a manager or general manager. Making a fortune is almost the same as that of a manager or general manager. It seems that in terms of fame and fortune, the principal's pulling is especially more important to learn cleverly than the manager's or general manager's pulling.</p>
<p>The second skill in pulling may be pulling credit. This pulling is the opposite of pushing.</p>
<p>To put it on a small scale: when playing soccer with someone, if you win, you shout to the crowd: Fortunately, I made that kick that secured the victory: if your brother shits and doesn't have toilet paper, if I didn't have waste paper to help you out of your difficulty, you wouldn't be able to stand up. Even the water-boiling boy can come up with a performance of "ugly boasting." To put it on a large scale: low-level junior staff, and workers who have worked hard, spared no effort, and made a fortune one day, when sharing dividends, are paid according to splitting seventeen shares, and get a fraction of one share, while the manager or general manager gets several shares alone; the white-robed young general and the cook, when seizing cities and territories, and the new general carrying the flag, are all credited to Zhang Shiguan and his son-in-law He Zongxian... Even the head of a whole country, who often oppresses the people and bullies the weak, calls himself the savior of the people and the protector of peace when giving speeches. In short, "all the unlucky, suffering, and loss-making bad things are pushed onto others," while all the smooth, prosperous, reputation-enhancing, status-enhancing, and income-generating good things are pulled onto oneself.</p>
<p>One pull after another, it seems that "three pulls" are needed to "reunite." However, there are really too many to learn for three pulls, and it is no longer just three pulls, which also goes beyond the circle of reunification. Now, I can only briefly mention a few to form a snake's feet.</p>
<p>People who write drafts and work as editors cannot help but learn this skill: there will be manuscripts when there is a shortage of manuscripts, and there will be good manuscripts when there are bad manuscripts. Generally, when there is no money, one can only bow, curry favor, and seize by trickery; when there is money, one can take from one to add to the other, or be thin to one and thick to the other. The former is a young newcomer, who is praised as an up-and-coming writer; the latter is an old writer, who is praised as an advanced figure in the literary world.</p>
<p>People who run booths and walk around on the Bund in Shanghai cannot help but learn this skill—</p>
<p>People who pull customers and frequent prostitutes—</p>
<p>Stop, if I keep pulling, it will become a mess. Let's stop here and not pull anymore.</p>
<h3>The Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Aren't we treating you well now?"</p>
<p>"What about last night?" She twitched her nose and asked painfully, "How did you treat me? Have you forgotten?"</p>
<p>"I haven't forgotten. I'll always remember it. I'll remember it very clearly. However, I'm telling you, you shouldn't protect your father. You shouldn't let private feelings make you forget public anger! What happened last night, on the one hand, was to strike at your father, not you, and on the other hand, was for the necessity of our work, which is money. You are innocent, we know. Do you understand what I'm saying?"</p>
<p>"I understand, so I am now standing between my father and you to speak!"</p>
<p>"What about last night?"</p>
<p>"Last night—is already over!"</p>
<p>"What about tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow hasn't come yet. I don't know about what hasn't come!" She sincerely asked him, "What do you say about me tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"What do I say about you tomorrow—" He thought about it and told her very seriously, "Tomorrow, you can go to heaven, or you can go to hell!"</p>
<p>"Heaven, hell?" (58)</p>
<h3>In the Reed Thicket</h3>
<p>— Si Fang</p>
<p>A Night at Zhaojiadu</p>
<p>Zhaojiadu, a desolate little ferry crossing downstream on the Huangpu River, is hidden in the reed thickets. Few boats dock here, and the silence throughout the day is terrifying. The wind blows through the reeds, rustling mournfully.</p>
<p>It is now evening. The evening tide of the Huangpu River crashes against the shore, the sound like a desolate lament. The reed thickets are buried in the thick darkness of the night, bowing their heads as the night wind whistles a weeping tune, causing them to sway left and right.</p>
<p>In the dark sky, a pale moon, like the face of a dead man, hangs, casting a faint, mournful, and sorrowful light.</p>
<p>Suddenly, rustling sounds emerge from the reed thickets, along with the sounds of footsteps moving in the shallow water. At the same time, faint whispers, mixed with the sobbing of the wind, rise and fall, indistinct and unclear.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, all sounds cease. Only the river, with a heavy voice, shouts, large clumps of foam swirling and crashing against the shore, rolling into the reed thickets.</p>
<p>The moon is obscured by a dark cloud, without a trace of light, and everything around is as black as lacquer.</p>
<p>In the reed thickets, a very faint, but rapid, breathing sound is revealed.</p>
<p>Amidst the shouting and roaring of the Huangpu River, the sound of wooden oars splashing water can be heard, making a "hua-la hua-la" sound.</p>
<p>A small boat quickly rows over from the opposite shore.</p>
<p>From the inky blackness of the night, one can vaguely see five or six people in yellow clothes sitting on the boat, all carrying guns on their backs, their eyes wide open like those of eagles, greedily looking at the dark night sky. Some are cheerfully whistling, sometimes bursting into loud laughter.</p>
<p>——Row faster!</p>
<p>A shout like a thunderbolt erupts in the silent night sky, and the sound of the wooden oars splashing water becomes more rapid, and the boat moves faster.</p>
<p>In the reed thickets, there is a slight commotion, and footsteps move through the water.</p>
<p>——Quick! Get ready! Chi Lao's boat is approaching.</p>
<p>A low command is given, followed by whispers among each other. Then, everything is silent again, except for the sobbing of the night wind, the lapping of the tide against the shore, and the sound of wooden oars striking the water in the middle of the river, like a depressing symphony playing in unison.</p>
<p>——Bang——</p>
<p>The first shot rings out from the reed thickets, followed by a series of gunshots. Bullets stream towards the small boat, like a driving rain mixed with hard hailstones. A cloud of thick smoke rises from the reed thickets, and firelight flashes in the dark night sky.</p>
<p>By the time the yellow-clothed men jump up in shock, raise their guns, and aim, they fall on the bow of the boat, fresh blood flowing gurglingly from the bow into the river. Endless bullets are shot from the reed thickets, and the bullets on the boat are also fired aimlessly into the reed mist.</p>
<p>The quiet Zhaojiadu is now lively. Bullets fly wildly in the air, and the shouts from the reed thickets are like roars from thousands of throats. The firelight reddens half the sky.</p>
<p>An hour later, the violent gunfire subsides, the firelight also disappears, and the smell of gunpowder and blood, mixed together, floats in the still air.</p>
<p>On the Huangpu River, a small boat is overturned, and several corpses roll with the waves, the yellow and turbid water mixed with fresh red blood.</p>
<p>In the reed thickets, fresh red blood also flows into the river. Several people emit painful moans, but they are drowned out by the majestic shouts and songs of triumph.</p>
<p>At this time, dawn has broken, and the morning light shines into the dense reed thickets.</p>
<h3>New Life at the End of the Century</h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>The end</p>
<p>is coming;</p>
<p>the decayed</p>
<p>corpse of the old world</p>
<p>is beckoning you!</p>
<p>Two In Asia,</p>
<p>a hesitant giant</p>
<p>has stood up!</p>
<p>Standing firmly on the summit of the high mountain,</p>
<p>like an ancient sage,</p>
<p>lonely</p>
<p>and standing upright!</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Wild winds are swirling!</p>
<p>Morning rain is pouring!</p>
<p>Nurtured in the interplay of light and heat,</p>
<p>the century has been given new life again.</p>
