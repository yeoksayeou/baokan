<h3>外匯黑牌的前途</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>自動掛縮非被迫暴縮</p>
<p>現在再也沒有比外匯黑牌的劇變，令人更驚心動魄的事了。但從這次劇變的經過看：起因顯然純由匯賣銀行自動掛縮匯價，乃至自動停止給售外匯。與被迫暴縮的情形，有主客之分，絕對不同。匯豐難是英商銀行，因爲他是中英匯兌平準基金管理委員會的主要角色，所以　形中儼然做了中國財政部在外匯黑市場上的代表人。他的這種舉動，是出于財部的授意，奉令而行。天下决無自己打擊自己之理。只憑普通常識來判斷，便知這次匯市激落，乃是我國政府對於管　外匯上的政策之變更，與法幣本身的安全絲毫無涉。</p>
<p>市場下幾種可笑的猜測</p>
<p>但當匯豐於七日晨初次掛縮對英匯價從八便士到七便七五後，市場上便謠諑紛紜，流言四起。有的從政治上穿　附會，惡意中傷，甚至謂這是歐美開始强制調停中日戰事的一種手段。有的從平進基金上妄加猜測，造謠破壞，甚至謂中國的外匯基金，經長期的貿易人超，與日僞的套買，已損失過半云云。有的放言我國政府已决定變更統制外匯的政策，實行貶抑幣値，甚至將供給外匯的機關，從上海搬到香港。又因爲各方亟待財政部發表這次匯市劇變的善後辦法，而財部方面始終沉默，在過去二天半內並木透露絲毫意見，所以更令人疑神疑鬼，擔愁着法幣的本身是否將發生問題。外加上海流通界的銅輔幣積漸收縮，公用軍輛公司方面又明白透露銅幣短少的消息。加强了各方窖藏銅幣的心理，甚而使用到各種代用貨以至用郵　印花找兌。更使人對於法幣的前途，不勝其杞憂。發行劃條，收縮五元十元法幣的風聲，又乘機復起。</p>
<p>八便士與進出口貿易</p>
<p>外匯平準基金管理委員會×××××××××××黑市場上，穩定於八便士的水準，已達九個多月。當時並無平衡機關的存在，當然沒有平衡的操作關係，這八使士的黑市率之出現，及其穩定，完全出於偶然之間，理論上是絲毫沒有任何根據的。</p>
<p>外匯平準基金管理委員會成立，並就這八便士的黑匯率，當做平衡換作的標準，除了假定其與貨幣購買力平價之外，也根本沒有絲毫理由的。但如前所述：外匯平準基金管理委員會的使命，除了杜絕投機活動減免不獲中央核準的次要的進口匯兌損失之外，還有籍以限制種種不必要的進口，促進士產的出口。</p>
<p>可是依最近進口貿易激增的趨勢來說：這個低於法定匯率的八便士黑牌匯價，顯已無力拘束一般的進口貿易，尤其像上海地：本年首四個月的進口値達一億八千五百七十萬元。較去年同時的六千八百七十萬元，幾增二倍，而佔全國進口總値四六。八％之鉅。</p>
<p>然　與貶值又完全不同</p>
<p>當去歲統制外匯以後，黑市場上之匯率，激劇的距離了法價而下落的時期，以至於黑牌匯價自然穩定於對英八便士的水準之後；在國內學術界方面，頗有主張把法價也相當貶低的人。主張眨低法價的理由：不外乎限制進口，與保護內地的出口，以至於促進出口，甚至於吸引華僑的匯欵歸國爲最有力。然政府當局，除了堅决維持法幣的對外信用，絕不願對此有所舉動之外，同時在其他方面，事實上也已進行着種種達成上述目的的手段，並已取得了非常的成效。比如進口商　買外匯，只有極少數能够照法定價購，大部份皆在黑　場上以高價購致，無形中已限制了進口。同時內地的運輸工具，大部分操於國家的手中，國家對於進口貨，自然巳依需要與否及具需要程度，而加以選擇。欠要的以至不必要的進口貨，在運輸下也巳受到嚴格的限制。至於從海外購買軍火，　大部份已實行以貨易貨的手段。彼此貨物價格的决定，用不若再用貶價政策來操縱。從而也　不再會影響到出口貿　的發展。至於華僑的匯款歸國，僅就具愛國心的發揚上已頗有收穫，而暗盤的存在事實上也够　僑的選擇了。</p>
<p>在這種種事實之前，政府旣沒有貶抑法價的必要，那末這次　　匯豐銀行　縮黑牌匯價，當然和貶值的政策，完全不同。並且我們從上錄的豺政部發言人的聲明之中第二條的內容來看：還可以獲得一個相反的明證。</p>
<p>如前所述：目前因爲季節關係，听以進口頗多，尤其非必需品的進口增加更甚。所以有根據有　於中國經濟的標準上，來　整外匯市價，維持國際的收支平衡，這裏　然透露出今後平準黑牌價的水準，在方注上和過去已有相當的不同。</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行始終維持着一先令二　　的法價，固然决不變更。但外匯平準委員會對於　市場上的平準操作，將放棄過去凍結於某一點（像釘住八便士者然）的政策，而將依有　於中國經濟的標準，並參酌進出口的季節關係，而隨機應變，因事制宜了。</p>
<p>（二）平準的標準，雖將因事制宣，他必以是否有利於中國經濟？作為選擇標準的原則、這顯和過去釘住政策、完全不同、因此今後出現的新水準、非一成不變的水準、能　比八便士小、也能够比八便士大。</p>
<p>粉碎日偽套買的陰謀</p>
<p>誰都知道：日本靠　發不兌現紙幣來掠取中國淪陷區內的原料　土產，除了把一部份運赴本國供給他工廠消費之外，同時也把不必要的另一部份，轉售於上海及其他各地，從而吸收法幣，以資套買外匯，不消說：他的這種計謀，必需以黑市場的無限制供給爲先决條件，同時又必需有穩定着的黑牌匯率時才可獲得充分的利益。尤其在近月來日圓對法幣激急　値的場合，同時法幣的黑牌匯率又長期穩定之中，他套買法幣外匯的必要及其利益，更來得鉅大。據最近報載：他現正用這種手段，在上海代他工廢向海外購買大宗棉麥：但因此次外匯暗市的掛縮以致無法進口。由此可知這次的劇變，實與「抗戰　策」上完全配合着的。</p>
<p>不過，僅僅從仲縮若黑牌匯率、來打擊日偽套買法幣外匯的陰謀，事實上是絕對不够。除非同時也能設法限制暗市場上　外匯供給才行。雖則在匯市劇變之中，也曾一度宣傳有將外匯供給的地點，從上海移至香港之說，但從財部發言人的聲明裏，絕無這種表示。這雖是一大遺憾，但適足以反映政府當局體念在滬中外商人的方便，以及于反映中國外匯基金的實力之雄厚。</p>
<h3>一個模範師的政治教育工作　（三）</h3>
<p>— 向榮</p>
<p>五，應發楊啓發式的講授方式，如預設想定，叫戰士來辦理；或者將一個問題，提出三個答案，叫戰士去想一想，那一個才對；或者遇到一個不易了解的問題時，把它打一個　當的比方等等。</p>
<p>六，購授　畢之後，最好能領導戰士照課文讀幾遍、難然不是去死讀書，但讀的方式也可以帮助戰士的了解和記憶，特別是不認得字，不能自巳看書的戰士。</p>
<p>七、課堂紀律的嚴肅，與提高戰士上課之興趣，是不相衝突的，這就是說，不要因爲要嚴肅課堂之紀律，便忽視了提高戰士，在課堂上的興趣，怎樣提高戰士的興趣呢？比方在講授中，挿上一些適當的笑話（興趣與課本有關的）；某些可用手勢做出來的，便做一些手勢，或者常戰士感覺疲勞時，叫大家起來唱唱歌等等，這些都是提高興趣之辦法。</p>
<p>（七）課外討論</p>
<p>一，每次上課之後，應舉行課外之討論，以班爲單位，在自習時間舉行之。班爲單行舉行討論之好處。在於能做到個個人都發言，又可以節省時間，且方式上也比較排連之討論要活躍得多。</p>
<p>二，因此，每研應設學習組長一人，以政治文化水平較高者任之，以領導各班之討論會。</p>
<p>三，討論會上如遇有不能解決之問題，則臨時請排以上之幹部來做結論，或留交次日複習時解决之。</p>
<p>四，指導員及敎員，應召集各班學　組長，於討論會之前開準備會，指示其如何進行討論，以提高學習組長之能力。</p>
<p>（八）複習：</p>
<p>爲使敎育的深入，除敎授方式之改善，課外討論之舉行外，在敎育進度上，　不要規定大快，我們的規定是；一天上課，一天複習，複習仍以連爲單位舉行，複習昨天所講的課。怎樣複習呢？</p>
<p>（九）輔助敎育：</p>
<p>一，連隊救亡室的佈置，應適合日常敎育之內容，以便做到輔助軍事政治文代敎育的作用。</p>
<p>二，政治機關須按照敎育之內容，經常製定一些輔助敎材的材料（如掛圖，歌曲，及劇本等等）。供給連隊採用。</p>
<p>（十）測驗：</p>
<p>一，個別的臨時的口頭測驗，由連排幹部隨時舉行，以便及時了解戰士之了解　度。</p>
<p>二，定期的測驗，可於一周或二周舉行一次，每連輪流以一個建制班受測。</p>
<p>（十一）行軍作戰環境中的敎育</p>
<p>行軍作戰環境，應繼續保持平時之敎育制度，不應停止。如行軍在六十里以內，仍可上一次課（一天上軍事，一天上政治），上課時間，可減至半點鐘左右，內容可以酌量減少。</p>
<p>二，行軍作戰之教育內容，應以解釋行軍作戰之任務與應注意之事項爲中心。如行軍期間較長，則於臨時敎材完畢之後，仍繼續進行經常的敎材。</p>
<p>三，在行軍作戰環境中，應注意閒隙時間（如行軍中之大小休息，作戰中待機或守備時機）之利用，但原則上應注意不致影嚮戰鬥任務，不致增加戰士之疲勞，而採用更麋活活躍的方式，（如以班　爲單位舉行，在戰場上的位置就地舉行，在哨所中舉行，及採用唱歌，講故事，猜迷語等等方式）。</p>
<p>（十二）雜務人員之敎育：</p>
<p>雜務人員在連隊中卽炊事員而言。爲什麼要特別提出他們來呢？因當他們由於本身勤務的關係，不可能參加一般戰土的上課，所以要有單獨的計劃。</p>
<p>雜務人員以營或以連爲單位上課呢？我們選擇了以連爲單位的辦法。什麼時間舉行呢？晚飯後最適宜。進度怎樣呢？每天上一次課（每周二次政治，二次軍事，一次衛生）每次半小時左右，內容可減少至一般戰士的一半。</p>
<p>（十三）敎育準備會</p>
<p>敎育準備會是爲講授人在上課以前而召集的。以營爲單位，各連之指導員及敎員均出席，由營敎導員主持之。準備會每周舉行一次，先總結上週的敎育，再準備本週內的敎育。須準備的事項，有下列各點；</p>
<p>一，本周內政治敎育內容之統一的解釋；</p>
<p>二，本周內政治敎育之補助材料的擬定與供給。</p>
<p>（十四）課外的政治敎育</p>
<p>以上所說的，大都關於上政治　的各項具體問題，政治課在部隊中，是作爲課內的敎育來看待的，此外，尙有課外的政治敎育，課外的政治敎育，有些什麼內容與採用何種方式進行呢？</p>
<p>一，軍人大會，以連，以營，或以團爲單位舉行的軍人大會，全體均須到會，這個會是爲傳達某項重要的政治問題，或解釋本部隊的其體任務，或討論連隊日常工作與生活，在連的軍人大會上）而召集的。連爲單位的軍人大會大的二周內舉行一次，營爲單位及團爲單位的則不定期，但每月至少總有一次。</p>
<p>二，問答晚會以連爲單位，全連戰十參加、採用比較活躍的方式，來深入某項要政治問題的敎育而舉行的。這種晚會上，先擬定好一些問題，提出來發問，指定人答要；並規定答對的有賞，如花生瓜子之類），答錯的要罰（罰唱歌，罰做口技等等）。連隊問答晚會不定期舉行但每月必有一次。</p>
<p>三，同藥晚會：以營或團爲單位進行，主要內容爲歌舞戲劇的表演。這種晚會雖然帶娛樂性質，但同時也有很大的敎育意義。部隊中每團均沒有宣傳隊（同時並兼劇社），所以連隊戰士每隔一周能看到一次戲。</p>
<p>四，紀念會：在紀念日舉行，按當時戰爭情况及紀念日的意義，分別以團營，或連爲單位進行。</p>
<p>五，讀報：師政治部出版一種定期的報紙，每周一期：報紙的內容，一方而是將本周內抗戰的形勢國內國際的重要時事，給以簡要的概達；一方面是部隊通訊，關於部隊工作的實際經驗與意見。</p>
<p>六，課外講話：關於時事問　，部隊日常的實際問題，需要在戰士中進行敎育的，由師　政治機關編成講話材料，利用課外時間或早晚點名時間講述之。這種講話不定期舉行，隨時决定，則隨時進行之不規定在整　敎育計劃之內。</p>
<p>乙，幹剖的政治敎育</p>
<p>幹部的政治敎育，按照各級幹部政治文化水平的差別，分爲連排一級，營團一級，及師旅一級，同時因爲各級幹部工作的繁簡不同，自習能力也有强弱，所以進行方式也有差別。</p>
<p>（一）連排幹部的政治敎育：</p>
<p>一，連排幹部的政治教育，每周舉行一次（另有一次軍事敎育），以營爲單位集合上課敎授人爲各營之敎　員，</p>
<p>二，敎育材料，在上面已經說過了，這裏要說的是，根據已有的村料，要　成簡明通俗的提綱，使講授的人才能抓住中心，使受敎育的人才便於了解，因爲現在之連排幹部的政治文化水平，對於看書的能力還是不高。</p>
<p>三，敎育方式，首先由講授人講解，然後以連爲單位進行討論。</p>
<p>四，測騐可以二周舉行一次、不必每周舉行、因爲幹部遇到測驗的時候、往往整天連夜去找材料、寫答案、因而妨礙了許多工作、同時　題也要出得靈活些：要出一些把理論聯系到實際的具體問題、以免一方面專門把書本照抄、一方面則死記條文、而不得活的運用、</p>
<p>（二）營閣幹部的政治敎育：</p>
<p>營團幹部的敎育，一般的問題與連排幹部差不多，特別的則是內容要深些，進度要快些，但上課次數到要少些，自習要多些，爲甚麼呢？因爲營團榦部政治文化水平較高，實際經騐較豐富，看到的問題也廣泛些，所以內容上必須比連排幹部深一點，進度上要快一點，同時營團幹部的敎育是以團爲單位進行的，因駐地關係，往往相隔較遠，多往餐時，所以次數則要少些，自習要多些，照我們的規定，營團幹部的敎育，一周上軍事，一周上政治，就是說二周內進行一次正治敎育，</p>
<p>營團幹部除上課以外，還應着軍於自習，要怎樣來帮助其自習呢？，第一要指定自習的適當的書籍；第二要根據這些書籍擬定一些問題；第三要組織他們集體的討論；第四要經常檢查督促並解答他們一些疑問及難題。</p>
<p>關於時事問題，我們還採用了這樣的辨法，師政治部將每天所收得的廣播新聞，印發到團營（連上則不要），團一級的幹部，每周舉行一次時事座談會，把本周內的抗戰形勢，國內國際的重要事件，總結一下，大家交換意見，這樣一方面可以推動幹部去研究時事問題，同時又可以供拾對下級做報吿的準備？</p>
<p>（三）師旅幹部的政治敎育：</p>
<p>照我們現在的情形來說，恐怕越高級的政治敎育，困難就越多些，爲什麼呢？第一就是因爲越高級的幹部，需要了解的問題越多，要求更大；第二正因爲上述原因，所以指導的人就比較困難，第三也由於前方的同志對於敎育經驗比較缺乏。</p>
<p>根據目前的情形，師旅政治的幹部敎育，主要的是採用座談和自習這兩種方式，上課的方式是比較困難。</p>
<p>座談會則採用輪琉做報吿方式，報吿人的報吿之後，由到會的同　補充，座談會最少二周舉行一次，如有臨時性質的問題（如團內及國際上比較重大的時事問題等），則可臨時召集。</p>
<p>（四）其他</p>
<p>以上所說到的各級幹部的政治敎育，都是關於不脫離職務，在工作中進行的，此外，爲塔養幹部起見，還有脫離職務，專門訓練性質的敎導及訓練班等。</p>
<p>訓練班又有二種，一種是爲製做幹部而開辦的，時閒須有四個月至六個月，一種是爲加强現職幹部的能力而臨時開辦的，時間可由一個月至二個月。</p>
<p>丙，戰時文化敎育，</p>
<p>（一）教育時間，每周文化教育時間為五次，以三次上識字課，一次上算術課，一次上自然常識課，</p>
<p>（二）分組，因爲戰士文化水平不一，所以識字課應分甲乙丙三種，算術課可分二組，自然常識則不分組，甲組，能記日記，能看普通文件的：</p>
<p>乙組：能識五十個字以上的：</p>
<p>丙組：識五十個字以下的。</p>
<p>（三）敎授人：</p>
<p>一，自然常識由敎員負責；</p>

<h3>魯西北通訊　北渡黃河記</h3>
<p>七、堤上夜會</p>
<p>在××——那依傍着黃河的美麗的小村鎭，我們愉快而有規律的度過兩整天了，早晨，當狄天的陽光照着河水發出金色的光波的時候眺秘書和我們常常爬到停在岸邊的大木船齊聲高歌。傍晚，又是我們一羣，在探伸到河中很長的××上。討論問題，檢討工作。這使我們忘記了白天跑到附近的村落裏工作的　累。我們只感覺到休閒　情趣和友情的溫暖。是暮夜的時候，月亮經昇起了照得燈水一片很白。我和姚秘書坐在河邊的士洲上等着所有的同志來，爲的是開座談會，</p>
<p>「姚秘書：今天看你好像有些不高　似的，爲什麼？」</p>
<p>「沒有不高與，」他否認着。</p>
<p>我又追問他，「那你爲什麼老呆呆的發楞呢　」</p>
<p>「我在想我們是不是遵命撤退。」</p>
<p>「撤退，」我爲他低憂　的聲昔驚住了，一爲甚麼，</p>
<p>「爲什麼？——爲命令！據說是××失陷了，××非常危急，而且這幾天城裏已經情況不明，土匪把城都搶空了，×處長剛才有電話來，說上面有命令讓我們卽刻撤退河南！」他氣憤的說，並且　恨搖了頭。</p>
<p>『我們就服從命令撤退嗎？』</p>
<p>『我想，　可以徵求大家的意見，』……</p>
<p>座談會上對於這問題起了激烈的爭辯，但，大多數的同志都是主張繼續前進的，理由是：每個人早知道過河來的工作是艱苦的，怕艱苦就不應該來，旣然來了，就是不怕艱苦就不應該中途囘去，並且，大家都爲　秘書的話激動了</p>
<p>「首先，大家都要知道，×城是我們的，正因爲×城危急，所以才更需要我們去，把善良的百姓們喚醒，組織起來，使他們參加保衛自己鄉土的鬥爭，這是有重大意義的工作……假設日本兵已經把×城佔去了的話，我們還必須設法把它奪囘來，何况，現在製造出×城的緊張空氣的是土匪，我想，土匪總是中國人，不是不可說服的野獸，而說服他們，爭取他們參加進抗日的陣　里來，正是我們政　工作人員的責任。……」</p>
<p>夜晚河水流盪得特別的響，伴合着我們激奮的呼喊，成功了一支絕妙的交響樂。</p>
<p>「我們要到×城去！」——嘩！嘩！嘩！</p>
<p>「我們不退守河南呵！」——嘩！嘩！嘈我們不退守河南呵！」——嘩！</p>
<p>水流像懂得人意似的，大聲的幫助我們喊着。</p>
<p>在銀色的月光底下，我們看見姚秘書有力的揮動着他的手。這很可以表示出他的果斷</p>
<p>同志們！旣然你們贊司到×城去，那些，我們就決定明天出發。但是，大家一定要有意志堅决，有與×城共存亡的决心。假設有毅力不够，不敢前去的人，可以在今晚自動的向我報告。我會發給他必需的路費，打發他囘濟南去再受訓，無論如何　不要偷跑……」</p>
<p>到×城去</p>
<p>第二天，我們勇敢果决的踏上了去×城的路，沒有個人要求囘河南的，隊伍中僅有的五位女同志，更精　，更興奮，同志們人踏着步子，唱着有力的歌。</p>
<p>到×城去罷，</p>
<p>走向民族解放的戰場！……</p>

<h3>再論天津變局與英國</h3>
<p>『我英國政府，何時可以振作英國威望歟』？</p>
<p>此英國議員彭斯密司氏　前在國會，質問英國當局之辭也。我人遠距英倫萬里，不獲身臨其境；然在紳士國家　中，模範議政之地，舉世矚目之時，荘嚴空氣之下，竟有此問；何難想見問者之情緒如何抑鬱，如何惶惑，如何血脈奮張，如何聲淚俱下。此在英國人乃至英國之友人，凡愛英國者，殆無不如是憂疑，無不同情於此一問。當時代表政府出席國會者　外務次官巴特勒氏，嘿然無　報之。嗚呼靜默霎那，是何景象？是何朕兆？×××××××××××××××××××憂疑，嫉英國者亦冷觀樓運；　聞德國海通社十四日倫敦電報所傳乎？彼述天津變局，謂『大不列顚帝國之威望如何，即於此　之成敗卜之！』謂彼德人對今日之英國，乃於其徬徨苦悶而揶揄之，刺激之，喚醒之，以促英國對日强硬，是必無之理，必無之事也愛之者，嫉之者，異口同聲作如是說，如是觀，蓋猶天　賴也，必眞理也。</p>
<p>天津變局，莫得而逆覩其結果，茲在演進之中，至記者握管時爲正非但絕無趨嚮緩和之端倪，且傳日本於實行封鎖英法租界之餘，一且準備以日僑五萬人，後備兵二千人，以掃墓爲由，整隊入英租界；彼邦朝野所示意，意義尤過之。如彼軍部發言人曰，要求英國承認日本所擬創建之東亞新秩序。彼外務省發言人曰，須英國保證不再千涉日本之遠東政策。彼報紙論調曰，外人在華租界業已證實其爲日本建立東亞新秩序之最大障碍。故應全部撤廢之。凡是云云，我人不必析言其涵義，不必闡明其影響，雖在下愚，亦得就其言辭，直接理解其願望；我人僅欲爲贅一言者，此皆數日來各國通訊社發自東京之報道，必遍載連日世界各報，蓋確訊也。故曰非但絕無緩和端倪，日趨嚴重乃至於極端，是意中事。</p>
<p>世界輿情，各國朝野，罔不爲津局表示焦慮；亦有故示矜持，微露樂觀者。反而在英國，彼於日本公然提示之欲念，以及仲裁辦法之拒絕，皆視若無覩：而曰，事　由外交途徑解决也；又曰，日本不願在遠東引起新糾紛，英國方努力於應付歐洲事件，故亦願避免糾紛　。作此說者，姑不必疑其報之資本何自，其人之血統何屬，亦不必稱其雅量逾恒，要不足以代表英國輿情，更未可視此爲　實　乃有緩和端倪。蓋據昨日倫敦方面之最後消息，英國政府固已因津變而擬議及於對日實施經濟報復焉，對華加強實力援助焉，邀約美聯合符動焉，議員奔走，當局緊張，其事其人，詳如本日報端所載，確乎其有山雨欲來風滿樓之槪矣。循是推進，東海之濱或且不免需要一時之慘痛犧牲，然有關遠東之各種現行條約必因此保全，相持二年之戰事必因此較易結束，國際公道與人類正氣必因此復蘇，而英國之威望尤必因此而　其萬丈光輝。</p>
<p>雖然所傳英國政府之所擬議者如彼，循是推進之必然成　如此，事實結果殊不可知也；何也，行必而議未必行也。其間蓋數魔日本實行封鎖天津租界，特別示惠美僑，而美國孤立派企圖封鎖總統羅斯福：影響所及，使英國政策趦趄，勇氣損弱此魔之在遠者一。英蘇兩國相需至殷在歐陸然，在遠來亦然，由來旣然，至津變而證明其尤然；然英國聯蘇，懷有患得患失之鬼胎；××××××××××××；於是最足贊助遠東趨於穩定之因素，爲雙，鬥法而湮沒；此魔之在近者二。英國昨今宣傳對日之各種擬議，若能實拖，必奏實效，但英人之傳統觀念以爲卽此說說，已足使日本知所忌憚，故不以實施爲必要之　動，而以宣傳爲有效之法門；蓋英人雖爲世界最尙實際之民族雖鄙薄徒說不行之政治家與宣傳家，然彼爲傳統之自尊心所蔽，估量自己太高，輒以所作宣傳乃因具有實力後盾而不同凡響聞者必知忌憚，忌憚卽是收效；詎知整個日本所以估量英國者，不若英國自估之高；而日本當權之軍人所以估量英國者，又不若日本穩健派估量英國之高，因此懸殊，英國所欲收效於『擬議」者，日本以</p>

<p>在過去的二十多月中，大上海市三百萬居民對于抗戰建國的堅决擁護，對于漢奸政權的無情打擊，不能不歸功於同志們的艱苦套鬥工作作風與堅定準確的政治路綫領導所致，同志們光輝的歷史，已在中華民挨解放戰爭的行程中，記上不可磨滅的二頁，同志們優越的作風，已在新中國的新聞工作羣中，樹下最模範的典型，我們謹代表全中國一千餘會友並號召一切進步的新聞記者，向你們致以最崇高的敬禮與衷切的慰問</p>
<p>自然，自汪逆抵滬以後，利用着他過去的地位，以及包圍在汪逆週圍的一大批大小漢奸，如周佛海，陳璧君，陶××，高宗武，褚××之流的活動興鑽營，同志們的工作會遭到更大的艱苦與困難，同志們的環境會陷於更大的危險與不測之中，我們對于同志們的安全與生活，無日無時不在懷念之中，但是，爲民族解放戰爭奮鬥而犧牲，是今天中國人民至高的道德，最低限度的信念，爲了打擊×寇的無恥　言與荒謬宣傳，爲了制止一切漢奸理論的抬頭，我們必須克服任何困難，踏過任何艱苦，向前進軍！在中華民族的解放戰爭的課目下面，在爭取世界永久和平人類永久幸福的課目下面，我們不惜任伺犧牲，不惜償付任何血肉的代價，必須與×寇漢奸奮　到底！</p>

<h3>旅美僑胞歸國談　反日運動在美國</h3>
<p>美人</p>
<p>【民革社通訊】美國人是百分之九十九同情中國抗戰的，平常，他們聽到『中國勝利』的消息，就歡天喜地，否則，縱使是小小的失利，他們也會和中國人同樣感到懊惱。</p>
<p>然而，中國抗戰開始以後，日本的軍用原料依舊有百分之五十四强是取給于美國的。這不是和美國人的本意矛盾而做了侵略者帮兇嗎？所以『援華會』和『中國人民之友社』這兩個經常推動援助中國工作的團體，積極從事於抵制日貨運動。同時，組織了一個『抵制日貨運動委員會』担負這項工作。</p>
<p>這會的幹事是從前「今日中國」的編者羅勃諾登。在他的熱心與能幹的領導之下，一年來的收穫很多。但還沒有達到如期的目的。在檢討之下，發覺到了過去工作路綫的錯誤：</p>
<p>因爲「抵制日貨」，許多美國朋友在信奉這口號下多購了德意侵略者的貨物。這固然有違于他們「和平運動」的本旨，又爲猶太人所反對。所以，從第二年開始這會的工作路綫變爲更積極，巳由「抵制日貨」進展至抵制侵略國貨　了。</p>
<p>据去年十二月政府的報吿，十二家飛機廠中只有一家有對日輸出飛機的嫌疑，今年春，這一家廠主又自動公佈早已　止對日輸出飛機了（這裏，去年七月美國務卿赫爾警吿廠商是一個直接的原因）；而輪出日本原料也大大減少了（這裏，去年夏季美國商務部警吿商人說日本準備金空虛，須接現欵方可付貨，是一個直接的原因）。這一切證明了這一運動的效果在不斷的增大中。</p>
<p>美國不能作進一步的援華制日，是因為有「中立法」在那裏作梗。所以修改「中立法」已成了大多數美國人的一致意見。今年春，迎着這一要求，在前任國務卿史汀生氏的領導之下，組了一個「美國不參加日本侵略者運動委員會」，以致力這一運動。</p>
<p>這會，今年通過了一個具體的方案：倘若他們的工作在今年七月國會閉幕前不能用政治方式修改「中立法」，則將以民衆力量實行禁運一切軍用品與原料給侵略者。用這一方式，經過相當時間，相信也能達到目的的。今年三月六日美西北亞可脫利亞市的市長，自動下令：自後一切工業原料及軍用品不能經此港運往日本。這一個例，昭示着這運動前途的光明。其他許多海港的羣衆。也在積極進行着這種運動。</p>
<p>華僑</p>
<p>華僑是堅决主張抗戰與支持抗戰的。他們雖然都非常忠實，但也們的觀察和做作即非常正確的。譬如　逆這個政治上的「妓女」，看來就沒有得到美國僑胞的喜愛與同情。說來眞要替汪逆可憐，他從前在外國辦下的報紙，現在不但已不是他的喉舌。而且是「村汪」的先鋒隊了。舉一個例來說：紐約「民氣日報」從前是他做後台老板創辦的，但在「豔電」之前汪逆暗中幹旋「和平」的時候，對正汪逆放第一砲的就是這「民氣日報」。「豔電」發表後，「民氣日報」更站在民族國家的立場上，攻得汪逆「體無完膚」。這「民氣日報」的照牌本來是汪逆的題字，但從今春起已拆毀了。</p>
<p>華僑的救國組織最初是很散漫的，但隨善抗戰的進展，組織也日漸進步和鞏固起來。從一九三七年末（抗戰後四五個月）起，全美華僑建立了三個最高的抗日救國的組織：</p>
<p>（一）全體華僑抗日救國籌餉總會：會址在紐約，所有美東華僑的抗日救國工作，由這團體領導指揮。</p>
<p>（二）義捐　會：會址在三蕃市爲美西華僑抗日救國之最高組織。</p>
<p>（三）抗日救國籌餉會：會址在芝城，爲美中華僑抗日激國工作之總機關。</p>
<p>除此而外，每個有華僑足跡的小埠，都有「抗日救國後援會」一類的組織，經常地担負着抗日教國的責任。</p>
<p>日僑</p>
<p>這次日本軍閥發動的侵華戰爭，不但對日本人民沒有絲亳利益，反而增加了他們無限的苦痛。這種情形在國內如此。在國外也如此。所以在美國的日僑，反戰情緒也很高漲。領導這反戰運動的是一日本勞動協會」。這會統有了二百多名會員。</p>
<p>從「九·一八」以後，他們的中堅份子都加入了「中國人民之友社」，他們經常地做着宣傳反對侵略中國的工作。他們常常相帝着會員和一些眞正愛日本的日本人到日本領事館去請願和示威。那時他們所用的名義是一日人愛國會」。</p>
<p>有一次，這會的領袖□□□在街頭演講反日援華，一位美國的老婆婆問他說：「你是日本人爲什麼宣傳反日呢？」他回答說：『我愛國。』跟着作了一個動聽的演說，說侵華戰爭是斷送了日本的國運，只有反對戰爭，帮助中國抗戰，日本人民大衆才有出路。</p>
<p>在這工作上最勇敢的是日本女作家松井女士，地參加了所有的反對侵略戰爭的工作，常常到各會場各街頭演說；說至熱烈處，必聲淚　下、聽衆無不感動。因此收效亦最大。每次演說完後，必捐得一筆款項來帮助中國，日本政府已下令捕殺她了，但在正義的維護下，她還在不斷地努力工作着。</p>
<p>韓人</p>
<p>韓人數十年來受着×人種種酷辣的壓迫統治，無時不在盼望解放中，只有中國民族解放成功，他們與台灣人才能得到解放。他們瞭解了這眞理，所以劉我們的抗戰是十分同情與帮助的。</p>
<p>爲了帮助中國抗戰，以求自己民埃的出路，韓人合併了許多小團體而組織「韓國援華聯合會」。</p>
<p>兩年來他們已帮助中國抗戰做了許多事，尤其在捐款方面的表現最好。他們正在繼續努力着，我們相信，所有韓人將來都會投到中國的懷抱來！【以上爲林玲君所記旅美僑胞朱耀渠君談話】</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>「傷病之友」</h3>
<p>蔣夫人宋美齡女士，爲使受傷將士減少痛苦，最近由慰勞總會撥出二萬元，組織「傷兵之友」團，分赴各戰區服務。我們認爲此舉極爲重要。因爲消極的减輕傷兵的痛苦，就含有振奮士氣與密切軍民協作關係的積極的偉大的意義。</p>
<p>抗戰快要兩年，我們已經依賴前綫數百萬將士的浴血苦戰而渡過亡國滅種的危險關頭，我們已經依靠前綫將士的慷慨捐軀斷折腿臂而獲見未來獨立自由的勝利之光，我們對於陣亡將士家屬，應當擴大濟助，我們對於負傷將士，自更應該崇敬愛護。何况，抗戰建國前途，艱苦尙多！</p>
<p>我們雖然苟免於×人的炮火殺戮與刦掠　但是我們囘首袓國，總不能無動於衷吧！我們希望華僑各界，一致奮起，擁護將夫人此舉，在各地組織『傷兵之友』團，因一面尤望有資望與有資產的僑界男女先進，慷慨捐助，以建事功！</p>
<h3>重要統計</h3>
<p>據某軍事專家研究最近×淸結果，有如下値得注意的結果：</p>
<p>（一）×動員侵華兵力已達二百萬；</p>
<p>（二）×死傷共一百萬以上，內死亡三十萬；</p>
<p>（三）現在華作戰×兵共卅一師團分佈華北華中華南（偽軍不計在內）；</p>
<p>（四）×侵華戰費計：</p>
<p>一九三七年二十五萬四千萬圓；</p>
<p>一九三八年四十八萬五千萬圓；</p>
<p>一九三九年五十二萬七千萬圓。</p>
<p>這個統計，大多根據兩國軍政當局公開數字，雖不能說絕對正確，但其尙無誇大或過意少算，大致可以相信。我們從這裏可以看到：×軍已受到如何的重大損失，特別是日益遞增的軍費負祖的困苦！同時叉可看到我們南北各戰場將士抗戰對於日×的威脅，我們的抗戰多支持一天，對於日×卽多一天損害！更可以看到今日之和平妥協論者，是怎樣在帮助日×挽救危亡，帮助日×補充力量滅亡全華！</p>
<h3>波羅地海爭奪戰</h3>
<p>— 世長譯</p>
<p>「未來歐洲大戰的輪廓</p>
<p>近日來，我們時常聽到波羅的海各國的地位和德國『前進』政策的關係，但是，一般論述都集中於政治行動，對於這些國家在戰略上的重要，似乎還沒有透澈的討論。</p>
<p>如果，一日歐洲發生戰爭——侵略國家與反侵略國家間的戰爭——，那末，立陶宛，拉達維亞和愛沙尼亞的軍事上地位，就顯得絕對的重要，很顯明的，如果德國進軍波羅的海，蘇聯决不能漠然無覩，而定必實行保衛波羅的海各國，因爲，這些國家，在地勢上，是蘇聯的天然堡壘。</p>
<p>在大戰中，蘇聯艦隊必將佔據很重要的部分，關於蘇聯海軍的實力，沒有人能够知道，這是絕對保守秘密的，但是，無疑的，蘇聯艦隊是够强大的，較之上次大戰時的實力，是不可相提並論了，除開黑海和遠東艦隊不計外，蘇聯在芬蘭灣一帶的海軍實力如下：兩萬三千噸戰艦兩艘，配有十吋口徑的大砲；配置精良的最新式巡洋艦六艘；驅逐艦約十五艘，精銳潜艇六十餘艘：和大汽艇十二艘。這樣的海軍。由能幹的司令帶領，是極有威力的；卽使對付德國艦隊，也可有良好的成績，而且，德國艦隊，在北海方面　更要維持相當雄厚的實力。</p>
<p>柏林誇言，北海沿岸巳經是决不會遭受侵犯了，因爲，在過去兩年，北自西爾特，南至飽肯，巳築有堅不可破的堡壘，但是，現代有識的海軍戰略家，都一致公認，沿海各地，雖有非常堅强的防務。也不能絕對避免外來的突擊，所以，德國的西岸防務雖然堅强，也是有被擊的危險的，而且，德國要想維持戰爭的進行，必須維持和斯坎的納維亞國家的貿易，尤其是瑞典。</p>
<p>在上次世界大戰中，德國能够支持四年之久，其主要的因素是：（一）德國經常的從瑞典運到大批磁鐵，以製造軍械彈藥，（二）猶太敎授哈培氏的新發明，從空氣中提鍊阿摩尼亞，如果，當時協約國方面能夠控制波羅的海交通，切斷德國和瑞典的運輸，大戰早可提早結束了，英國潛艇隊曾有一時期，稱雄彼羅的海，阻礙德國和瑞典的交通，使德國深感不安，但是，由於俄國艦隊的呆滯，未和英國潛艇合作，造成了德國的幸運，繼續向瑞典運進磁鐵，而支持了歐洲大戰，達四年之久。</p>
<p>現在的地位，巳根本不同了，靈捷的蘇聯艦隊已能活躍波羅的海，對於德國和瑞典的海上交通，實是嚴重的打擊，這些，德海軍當局也知道得很淸楚，所以它的戰略是增强芬蘭灣的海防，牽制蘇聯艦隊，尤其是不議潛艇隊有活動的機會，但是，目前的德國尙不能執行這種偉大的任務，因爲，芬蘭灣四週的根據地，並不在德國掌握中；而但澤和美米爾又距芬蘭灣太遠，無能為力，德國唯一可以利用的，是拉達維亞的里格，愛沙尼亞的德林和波羅的海上的達哥羣島，這都是海軍要地。德國如能加以控制，便足以對付蘇聯的艦隊，而波羅的海也就是希特勒的天下了。所以，一旦戰爭爆發，德國仍願尊重波羅的海各國的中立，是决難令人相信的。</p>
<p>蘇聯巳準確的認定，在戰爭發生的時候、德國必定攫取拉達維亞和愛沙尼亞的沿海各地，如果蘇聯嚴守海上防禦政策，就可以避免襲擊，而保持其艦隊的實力；而敵方的空中襲擊，必須嚴加預防。總之，蘇聯波羅的海艦隊究將採取怎樣的政策，除了莫斯科海軍當局外，是沒有人能够知道的，最近蘇聯有許多高級海軍官員竭力主張「進攻」的海軍政策，所以，在一旦有事的時候，蘇聯艦隊必有積極的行動。</p>
<p>波羅的海各國，在地勢上，是抗拒德國進取芬蘭灣的天然堡壘，如果，希特勒能够控制這個重要的海灣，則在海軍戰略上而言，蘇聯艦隊就等於盧設，毫不足用；而除了白海以外，蘇聯的一切出海道路，也全被切斷了。</p>
<p>波羅的海各國是目前國際政局的中心，也將爲未來德蘇大戰的决勝場。（節譯廿二日本港德臣西報）</p>

<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>英國約克大主敎發起全世界基督敎徒于七月九日，一致爲中國祈祷。我们除了深致謝意之外，別无他說。但望在爲中國祈祷之餘，更能爲全世界祈禱，把太野蠻的人種，感化到合理的地步，再把太文　的人種，感化到挺硬起腰子來。</p>
<p>英蘇談判，輾轉迄令，已經三個月了。仍然未趨一致。公說公有理，婆說婆不錯。我們怎麽說呢？千鄉底事？何必左右得罪人。</p>
<p>有個什麽慈善社，主辦了什麼港九超　中華殉難軍民萬人緣大會。定什麽　歷七日二十日舉行，又由什麽活佛主持。我們封這件事，根本不大明白，不知道是否又是「時輪金剛法會」之流。這就是：救國人人皆會，各有巧妙不同。</p>
<p>今天本版的「小掌故」，介紹了冰淇淋的小史。冰湛淋在香港呌雪糕。一個朋友說，雪糕是香港的譯名中最　麗的了；另一個朋友提出抗議，說，名字雅則雅矣，可是不大通，冰淇淋實在是冰做的，不是雪。據說，香港地方對冰和雪的區別，很漠然的，因香港根本沒有雪。這，是否的確，我們尙在保留。如果　者中，那位老香港知道，而且高興予以指敎，倒頗所歡迎。</p>
<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>馬君武</p>
<p>從前做過中國公學，廣西大學校長的馬君武博士，是一位苦幹，硬幹的敎育家。</p>
<p>馬博士自奉極儉，衣履飲食，都是最起碼的。應酧送體，請客糜費，自然更不可爲。</p>
<p>那是在廣州的時候，一天，馬博士忽然接到了一張請柬：謹詹于月之某日下午六，時假座大三元，略備菲酌，敬請光臨。下面署名的，是兩個熟朋友。</p>
<p>爲什麽請客？馬博士有點莫明其妙。但是，請而不往，非禮也。於是，决定準時而到。</p>
<p>那天晚上，大三元好不熱閙，車水馬龍，羣賢畢至。人又多，菜又好，馬博士吃得很對勁。酒醉飯飽之餘，馬博士準備去找主人道謝吿辭，可是，那兩個請的客伙全不見了。所有的客人，却都圍將上來。說：「謝謝馬先生，今天叨光了。」一個個揚長而去。</p>
<p>馬博士，可眞丈二和尙摸不着腦袋，趕緊，跑到櫃台上一看，水牌上明明寫着着：五號——馬君武先生　客。這才知道中了人家的惡作劇</p>
<h3>我是希特勒的囚犯</h3>
<p>死亡綫上</p>
<p>德國『天主敎週報』的發行人，裘里區傳士，因爲他常常把納粹的暴行，向讀者作忠實的報道，結果，便被希特勒請進了集中營。下面是他在營中日記的一頁：</p>
<p>五月十六　日記得我是在三月九日那天，到這地方來的，算起來，已經兩個多月了。住在三層樓上，這間小而黑暗的房間里面，雖然，不很舒服，我到也不在乎，似乎日子過得也還安靜，獄卒們也和我很能談談。</p>
<p>但是，終於來了；晚上將近一點鐘的時候，來了兩個人，說是秘密偵探，要帶我去審問，獄卒們也沒有來得及看他們的命令，我就被帶着走了。他們押着我，經過走廊，到管理處，就拿出繃帶來，紥沒了我的兩眼，然後，他們將我拉到束，扯到西，上樓，下檔，許多次，無非想使我迷失方向，然後，才將我領到一間房間。</p>
<p>眼上的綳帶解去了，眼睛被燈光逼射得發眩，我模糊地見到，那是一個頗寬敞的房間，在我面前，有許多通明的電燈向我照耀着，燈光後面的黑暗處，坐若好多人，但是，因爲黑暗，我看不淸楚他們。總之，還里就像一座戲台，我是演戲的，在燈光下，他們是觀衆，都在黑暗中。</p>
<p>「裘里區博士！」黑暗里，像一隻牛鳴，這時，也能模糊看得出，有幾個黑影子在移動。</p>
<p>『關於褐色屋的消息，是誰吿訴你的？』</p>
<p>「我的報紙上，刊登過的任何文字，都由我本人負責；沒有其他的人。』我冷然的囘答。</p>
<p>『看起來，你是不願意洩露你那些同謀，是不是？』又是一個粗暴的聲音。</p>
<p>『我不願意。』我乾脆一下子，把他頂囘去了。</p>
<p>一秒鐘，房里死寂，於是，我被按在一張桌子上，橡皮棍兒，雨點般的打下來，打了二十五下。</p>
<p>我不做理會。</p>
<p>我又被按在一張椅子上，再受盤問。</p>
<p>我死不開口。</p>
<p>「你這條老狗，我們馬上要叫你開口。」</p>
<p>於是，我又被打了，大約又是二十五下罷。我幾乎俘過去，蹒跚的囘到椅子上，呼吸都很困難。</p>
<p>『現在你肯直招了嗎？』</p>
<p>我爲甚麼要直招？</p>
<p>拍，一聲，一支手槍拋在桌子上，有人咆哮地發出命令，「槍在那兒，你拿了自殺吧！你，你這個惡棍！」</p>
<p>我開口了，『我才不自殺呢，我是天主敎的信徒啊。』我跪下祈禱，我只一心虔念着上帝，任從他們將我怎麽辦！</p>
<p>大約他們也害怕上帝的譴責吧，他們互相商量了半天，倒真也不敢來殺害我。</p>
<p>審問就這樣算終止了的我仍舊由兩個秘密偵探帶出房外，剛到樓梯口，有人將我使勁一推，我一下子就栽到樓下，躺在樓板上，正想摸着欄杆，起來的當兒，又有人用　重的皮鞋，搶若在我手上踷下來。</p>
<p>我躺着不動了，還有穿着騎馬靴的脚，在我身上踢，有人大聲的喊着：</p>
<p>『你情願說嗎？你這條老狗！』</p>
<p>我囘到這小而黑暗的房里來時，週身都流着血，我又向上帝祈禱，我感謝他，因爲我雖然遭了毒手，到底還是活着；終有一天我還能繼續去做我的工作。</p>
<h3>小掌故</h3>
<p>— 冰淇淋</p>
<p>寒暑表跳到了九十幾度，汗流如雨；你又得呷冰其淋了——香港是叫雪糕。但是，你知道，冰淇淋的掌故和史實嗎？，現在吿訴你一點。</p>
<p>冰洪淋的發源，根本沒法稽攷。只　說，亞歷山大女王很歡喜呷冰水和冷的飲品，特派下屬去敲冰歸來，採鮮菓凍蔽，滋味旣好，又凉入心脾。於是使變成了一種聖品。，這或許就是一些根源。</p>
<p>十七世紀初葉，法王路易十四參加一次宮宴之後，在日記上寫着：『宴會將終的時候，每個賓客面前，都端上來一個銀杯，杯裏盛若一個鷄蛋般的東西，許多人都奇怪這件新玩意，在嘗了一口之後，才發覺是一團非常美味的冰凍奶油。』</p>
<p>直到一六六〇年，巴黎才有出售冰凁奶油的咖啡店。英國及其它各國也爭相仿製，但在這個時期之前，一切凍飲都沒有甜味的；之後，冰淇淋的製造法，編成了專書，裏面吿訴人可以放糖，放各種鮮菓子汁，於是有了進步。</p>
<p>同時，冰淇淋製造法傳到了美洲，美國一個叫菲律倫的廚師加以精心研究，皇皇然在報紙上發表意見。他　力於餐肴之改良，當時極有聲名，所以這一下子更紅了起來，在美國提起菲律倫的大名，響亮非凡，實在，他的一切，也是從倫敦去學來的。一七八九年喬治華盛頓舉行歷史上的名宴，席上用的冰淇淋，就是由他一手包辦。</p>
<p>日新月異，冰淇淋的方式，自然愈來愈進步了。現在，最進步的，在美國街道上，你可以把一個角子，丟進一個籍子，立刻，你可以拿到一杯冰淇淋。</p>
<p>「法官審問你的時候，你先這樣地笑一笑好了。</p>

<h3>海上風雲</h3>
<p>— 三十　勞頓上慰著　楊譬譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，德輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着八百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯　公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上接着個消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來　不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息，幸虧冰山不久便滑過去了，但是旅客却受驚得失常，閙了一場事，傑克和一個德敎授起了衝突……</p>
<p>「結寃家！怎麽會？」傑克不服的說，「這傢伙只是個窮兇極惡的懦夫。他——」</p>
<p>「唉，話是不錯，不過，他是德國敎——」</p>
<p>「算了吧！你也將這些擺在心上嗎？」</p>
<p>「不錯，他是德國軍專學校的敎授，這位拉維基大敎投，在德國是位挺了不得的人物呢。」鮑佛很忠厚的吿訴他。</p>
<p>「好　，老長鷄先生，不管地叫些甚　鬼省字，或者地是如你所說的那麽一個大人物，但是他總是一個懦夫。若照他晚的，要到船長那兒去找我的麻煩，我一點也不會着急，第一，我現在的地位，不過是個義務職員，第二，我可以和你賭一客煎餅，或者賭一只你喜歡的那　大蘋菓，那老長　先生正來不及想將昨晚上做的事遮蓋　呢，還能再枓出來嗎？」</p>
<p>這個傑克却看錯了，將來，他就會知道拉維基敎授并不怎麽輕。鬆容易的放過他呢。</p>
<p>六　兵艦來了</p>
<p>這天下午，傑克聽見，一些受不了刺激的旅客，又驚心動魄的叫起來了。他趕快跑到中板上，看見北面的天際，有一團濃烟，並且，看得出是一只船，在望遠鏡裏面，已看出了，那是一條兵艦？但是，屬於那一國的，一時還認不出來。</p>
<p>傑克連忙跑進無線電室，鮑佛說并沒有收到任何電訊，也沒有聽到與這條怪船有關的消息。在架樑上，船員們驚詫的計議着，這條兵艦，每分鐘都在移近，她是一條黑色，寬而短的船，有兩個很粗的烟窻，那裏面，正捲出很濃，很多的黑烟，在她船頭的前面，濺起大堆白沬，顯出她正在望前急速的推動</p>
<p>等了一會，鮑佛叫起來，『啊，現在來啦　』他飛快的寫下來，將它交給傑克，傑克看上面寫的是：</p>
<p>皇上命令，立刻停止進行。</p>
<p>勃維克號</p>
<p>「我馬力將它送上去」，傑克嚷着，「海斯，你用耳朶拚命聽着，看還有什麼消息沒有。」</p>
<p>「我祖保不會錯過，傑克，你想，他們會開炮打我們嗎？』</p>
<p>『我不知道，我猜想，若是我們不停船，他們就會的。』傑克說着，趕快跑了。</p>
<p>船長看過字條之後，他說，『正是我想到的。』</p>
<p>『要我去吿訴海斯，回話過去，說我們停船了嗎？』傑克問。</p>
<p>『停！我不能服從英國痗軍來停船。』船長暴燥地說。</p>
<p>他立刻拿起電話，下令到機器間，吩咐儘可能的增加熱力，使船『加速前進』，於是，這船就　離了弦的箭，樣、向前往竄，烟突裏成堆的黑烟向外滾，煤灰下雨般的落到甲板上。</p>

<p>撥欵千萬促進生產</p>
<p>自行政院通令各省促進生產、並飭主管機關籌撥的款後、决定由主管機關撥一千萬元、以供發展內地生產事業之用、指定廣西、四卅、西康、貴州、陜西、甘肅、江西、雲南八省、於農業則改良種子、獎進副業、防治害蟲、講求水利、開墾荒地、於工業則改良技術、提倡國貨、獎進小工業及手工業、發展礦治事業及活潑鄕村金融、健全各業組織等、</p>
<p>集中輸出　易取外匯</p>
<p>自貿易委員會實行管理輸出之後、前後經其協助輸出者、不下數千萬元、集中出口外匯、將近數萬萬元、如漢口之存茶、存油、存絲、以及江浙之絲茶、皆頓該會之疏通搶運、而後到達香港易取外匯、其他對各省物資之協運收購亦頗有成績、最近又增加辦理對某國易貨事宜、業務因此更形發展、預料今年內管理輸出之價値、較去前兩年益見增加、</p>
<p>闢新路線　促進貿易</p>
<p>自上海我軍撤退後　對外貿易遂集中粵漢、自粵漢撤退後、對外輸出之得以經海防外運、皆爲中央鼓勵協助所致　而後方各關貿易數額之激增、以及若干商品輸出價値之續有增加、如無貿易委員會居間斡旋、必難獲得良好之結果　最近中央趕建滇緬鐵路、新設某某公司、對於促進貿易更進一步　使主要土貨得由新交通綫源源輸出　實爲抗戰建國中之良好現象、</p>

<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 識屺</p>
<p>聽　故鄉侖陷的消息，巳經是深夜上時許了，</p>
<p>抓起一支破舊的禿了頭的筆，在紙上亂點，想將它按在紙上留下些痕跡。</p>
<p>微弱的煤油燈的光放散着，不時的震蕩，向菁上面昇，昇，搖　着，發出細微的噓噓的聲音。筆尖在紙上只按下了些圈，直線，石頭般的無意識的東西，只有這些東西，才是我心中惆悵的惰緒所遺棄下的。</p>
<p>窻外是一片黑越越，隱匿着秘密與不祥，天空沒有星星，沒有月亮，沒有雲，也沒有霧，看去只是一片的黑暗的板着的冷酷的臉孔，建築物的尖頂之輪廓挿入黑色的迷濛中。</p>
<p>驟然，一片疾風捲來的響聲　滴滴打打的接續不斷的聲饗，在我的充塞滿惆悵與無舊念的心情中，只是一片哭號的慘聲與憤怒的交集。雨聲繼續若，窻外依簿是一片黑色茫茫，由遠處建築物的窻格子中射出來的一條微弱的光輝反映出幾滴雨點的晶瑩，我的眼眶也滴出幾粒血淚的晶瑩。</p>
<p>像剛才驟雨將至前的黑雲，一切的囘憶，都緊緊的擠住了整個的心，似乎是吃得飽了，將要發嘔。</p>
<p>韓江平靜的江水，江畔，爸爸望着滯了的江水向我說：「生活將是會和江水一樣的平靜嗎？」發出了這樣的感慨，他的臉上泛起了難看的笑容，就這樣的別離了，在那汽笛聲的慘啼中。</p>
<p>繼着，江水染上了血紅的時候，人們也就各自飄蕩一方！啊，至今，兩年了，整整的兩年了，在這兩年流亡的生活中，我總想不透爸爸所說的那句，生活將是會和江水一樣的平靜嗎！」的嘆息　不錯的嗎？或許是的，挨過了這段。流的時間生活也將就會和江水一樣的平靜了吧？</p>
<p>雨聲漸漸的低了下去，只下時的聽見一兩聲跌落着觸着地面的聲音衝破了深夜的沉寂。煤油燈的火焰也不定的越跳越高，我知道：他將要熄滅了。禿頭的筆依舊是　在紙上，依舊是那些圈，直線，石頭樣的東西。</p>
<p>燈光突然的熄了，猛然仿佛看見所憶念的人都變成一支反抗的火　衝破了像江水一樣平靜的生活向着無邊無際的高空中去了。</p>
<h3>我默認了</h3>
<p>— 靑木</p>
<p>到了薄暮時分，淡淡的天幕上掛着淡淡的彎月，我喜歡在這個時候坐上木柵窗邊一隻方桌，我眺望那些靑樓的山，古懌的彎起了腰背的參樹，有一天的傍晚，牧童牽着經過木柵窻，他看到了我。</p>
<p>——病了麼？</p>
<p>——沒有。</p>
<p>——為什麼不山來走走呢？</p>
<p>——牽了牛囘去後，到我這裏來玩吧！</p>
<p>——好的，不過你得等很久</p>
<p>他拉起了花格布的衣服抹去了臉上的十珠。那個油光光的額頭，是給太陽晒得多黝黑啊。他睜着一對圓靈靈的黑眼珠。好奇地望着我。他好像要對我說一僩什麼秘密以的。</p>
<p>扁薄的　唇在動着，可是沒有說出什麼來。草蕪一樣不齊截的頭髮，向前倒下來的兩隻細軟的耳朶都像是期望着什么。</p>
<p>——怎樣呢？</p>
<p>——我又看到一對掛彩的。你說，子彈穿進了腿肚還可以出水麼？</p>
<p>——當然……</p>
<p>——那末我們不是可以拾起來……再打進日本鬼子的腦壳去！</p>
<p>他對於我的笑，奇突的笑，是不解的吧。</p>
<p>——你囘去吧。等一會我們來談談這些好麼？</p>
<p>他又拉起了衣角，抹着汗：</p>
<p>——……好吧……</p>
<p>走開去了。繼着是黑夜。黑夜——那靜穆有着濃重的恐怖的黑夜：每一根樹枝都變成了一隻隻足以扼斷人們底喉管的魔手，我望着天空漸漸黑下來，終於　較乏　到在木板床上。我感到了有些衰疲　但是，祗要心的跳動不中止，無論怎樣是非得工作不可的呵。</p>
<p>我有點寒冷的樣于，不能不從木板床上支持起來，在黑暗中摸索着火柴，燃亮了油燈，我望　了桌上那麼多的『人員武器統計報吿表』還得擊理。我興奮了、我意識到剛才是一個夢——一個挺壞的惡夢！</p>
<p>「那是一種恥辱！」</p>
<p>默認了，我默認了。油燈芯的火光在跳躍，我記下剛才那一刻……每一個細節都寫下了。是一面鏡子吧，或者將成爲一面鏡子。</p>

<h3>細菌及麻醉劑戰爭（上）</h3>
<p>— JMurray作　天任譯</p>
<p>晚近一個比國科學家宣佈說，細菌將於下次火戰被用爲殺人的利器，這使得億萬人士家不寒而慄，同時引起了無數專們家熱烈地討論。</p>
<p>法國報上曾傳說，德國化零實驗室，正日夜從事培養億兆具有不同毒性的各類細菌，掃　×國人民。許多法國化學專家還莊重地將這些致人死命的毒菌分門別類，並指明每種細菌所能引起的病害，一些英國的科學家。雖未置信這些傳說，但對於細菌會被用於下次大戰的一問題，都嚴肅地點頭！很難預吿。</p>
<p>這些　出現於下次大戰的致死武器的秘密尙木洩露時，人們一提到它就戰慄不巳，大家都厭惡談論這種會絕滅億萬人類的細菌戰。但歐洲許多報章，現在深感過去太忽略這一問題的錯誤。因謂一開始討論這問題後，（雖無略覺　遲）就得到可信的結論。認爲細菌作爲武器，所能招致的損失極有限。</p>
<p>（一）施用細菌極受限制。</p>
<p>英法兩國的專家們，都堅信施行細菌戰，較諸使用別的武器，受限制更甚，巳發現的細菌，各國的科學家都知道了。他們的習性特性都曾深刻地研究過，並且分類記錄下來。毒氣是能在試騐室中製造的，但細菌—卽使能培養出可以掃　人類的新種—却難大量地培養。卽使有某國的軍部企圖利用巳知的細菌作戰，仍然有許多困難存在。</p>
<p>傳佈疾病方法有二種：</p>
<p>第一個方法，由於個人間的直接接觸而傳遞疾病。因此如要將疾病廣佈×國，使他屈　，則首先須犧牲無數本國軍隊，使他們感染疾病再秘密派往×國。用這種方法去打擊×人，犧牲顯然太重。因爲這種　媒介一卽使能完成其使命，但×人能隔離病人並設法撲滅這種流行病害。</p>
<p>第二種方法是，用蚤，鼠等爲媒介將疾病注入×國。用這種方法，則軍中須携帶數百萬蚤，鼠而行。且須是感染桿狀菌性的肺病或黑死症。</p>
<p>（二）鼠輩不能完成使命</p>
<p>當我將蚤，鼠是否能用以傳播疾病於×國一問題，向一個瑞士化學家提出時，他對我說不可能。因爲蚤鼠並無國族意識。經騐過第一次大戰的人，當能證明他們是不會分淸×友的。因此蚤鼠不分界線的傳散疾病，將令雙方戰線上都盛行傳染病。</p>
<p>一位英國的細二學者約翰華哂（John　Fawcet　）說如無下述原因，則以上二種方法都能絕滅×人。</p>
<p>他說：一每種疾病的細　，只要知道了，都能用一種血淸去抵抗他。這種血淸是感染這種疾病的動物血液製成的，具有避疫的効能。因而巳知的各種傳染病發生時，或發生之前，可以迅速大量出血消以減除病害。</p>
<p>「只有一些未知其種類的細菌，才眞能絕滅人種族，如果有那一國的細菌　究部能秘密地培養一種未知名的疫病細菌，並能製出血淸以注射本國人民，則那個國家就眞能用這種不能防制的疫病去滅亡×人，然而這種可能性，似乎仍　渺茫。</p>
<p>（三）以麻醉擊爲武器的戰爭。</p>
<p>那些討論及下次戰爭中所用的武器的專家們，都堅信麻醉藥將得優勝，一位英國作家卡兵特（John　Carpenter）是專門研究戰爭武器的，曾在他的一篇文章上說，麻醉劑可以大規模地用作戰爭武器，而且使用簡便，他叙述使用麻醉劑的情形如下：</p>
<p>「大戰爆發時，百萬戰士集於前線，忽然×方礟火，向他們猛烈轟擊。落在他們中間的礮彈可有點異樣，都炸裂而成粉碎的塵士，陣陣「彈塵」降到戰士身上，立刻整千整萬的倒臥地下，失去知覺，轉瞬之間，百萬雄師都麻醉而倒地。於是大礟停止轟擊，跟着就有大批×人，如潮地湧來。百萬失了知覺的人，被解除了武裝。並被×人團團圍住，在要緊的據點上，還安置着許多機關鎗。不久，他們才漸漸蘚醒，當他們恢復意識時，四面八力安置好的揚聲器，就吿訴他們，若不投降。就會被殲滅。他們自然是覺得犧牲無益，而無條件的投降了。戰事也就如此結束。</p>
<p>（四）蕭伯納寧取麻醉劑或毒氣戰爭</p>
<p>英國大文豪蕭伯納，在他最近評論戰爭武器的文中，曾宣稱：他寧願被麻醉而失去知覺，或竟中毒氣而窒死，而不願被十六寸口徑大礟轟成碎片。</p>
<h3>從成都到西安</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>八、漢寶路上懷往事</p>
<p>「力拔山前氣蓋世，</p>
<p>時不利兮　不逝；</p>
<p>不逝兮可奈何，</p>
<p>虞兮虞兮奈若何？」</p>
<p>而拔劍自殺了，英雄氣短，自古驕兵必敗，橫行霸道者必敗。非獨項羽爲然，卽霸及歐洲的無匹英雄拿破侖，最後也不能不從莫斯科　必　地而潰走，永不能再起。我們眼見日本軍閥蠻橫霸道的侵略暴行、在最近的將來，必將得到如項羽，拿破崙一樣的後果。</p>
<p>過棧道，經留霸，卽爲廟台子。地極幽靜，風景美麗。有「漢張留侯祠」，卽張良廟。劉邦籍韓信，張良，蕭何之力得天下，號曰漢，自立爲漢高祖。之後，卽對韓，張，蕭三人，懷抱猜忌之心。最後，竟將立國功臣韓信，置于死地。蕭何下獄，聰明絕頂的張良，把這些看得淸淸楚楚，對于他未來的命運（假如他不走開的話）也看得淸淸楚楚，于是他便决然韜　，相傳到這恬靜的地方來作寓公了。失了這三傑的漢高祖劉邦，其後的功業也便開始　　了。可知人材對于國家民族的重要性；可知一個領袖若無容人之量，必不能在政冶上有爲。　這也是古今中外無不皆然的眞理了。</p>
<p>出柴關嶺，入雙石鋪；爲小鎮，分兩路，一赴寶鷄，一赴甘肅省之天水，經新疆，通蘇聯之西北國道，卽經于此。由此可知×人最近在鄂中的活動，妄圖波漢水，攻襄陽，威脅漢中，不是毫無原因的。</p>
<p>過變石舖，即漸入秦嶺，懸崖絕壁，高聳雲霄，石壁坑谷間，積雪盈尺。據云飛機過此，因氣壓過高，機中人多口鼻流血，且如非十分熱練的機師，不敢輕飛這山嶺，車費二小時，爬上嶺頂；下山，拐灣凡二十七，才下到山脚，出山地，便是渭水半原，目的地的寶鷄，巳萬家燈火，閃耀目前矣。</p>
<p>寶鷄亦爲小城，但因地處隴海鐵路之西都終點，東通西安轉陝，晉，像冀，察各省，南入漢中轉蓉渝，如抗戰轉入第二期，一切鐵路線都失掉了以後，這地方為連貫華西華北的公路線樞紐，車馬不絕。正因爲這個原故，抗戰以後，一天一天繁榮；馬路開闢日多，間有一二參層洋樓房式的樓宇；電燈裝置起來了，人行道上沒有了火油氣味；抗戰使寶鷄走上了資本主義都市的道路，雖然現在還才在開始。</p>
<p>晚九時，再坐着了祖國剩下來的唯一火車——隴海車，向歷代每定爲國都的長安，民族復與發祥地的長安，進發了。</p>

<h3>The Future of the Black Market Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>Automatic Contraction, Not Forced Collapse</p>
<p>Nothing is more alarming than the sudden changes in the black market exchange rate. But looking at the process of this change: the cause is clearly the banks selling foreign exchange automatically contracting the exchange rate, and even automatically stopping the sale of foreign exchange. This is different from a forced collapse, with a clear distinction between subject and object. HSBC is a British bank, but because it is a major player in the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, it implicitly acted as the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Finance in the black market for foreign exchange. Its actions were based on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, acting under orders. There is no reason to strike oneself. Based on common sense, it is clear that this sharp drop in the exchange rate is a change in our government's policy on foreign exchange controls, and has nothing to do with the safety of the legal tender itself.</p>
<p>Several Ridiculous Speculations in the Market</p>
<p>But when HSBC first contracted the exchange rate against the British pound from eight pence to seven pence seventy-five on the morning of the 7th, rumors abounded and gossip spread in the market. Some people maliciously slandered and attached political interpretations, even saying that this was a means for Europe and the United States to forcibly mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Some people made wild guesses about the equalization fund, creating rumors and undermining it, even saying that China's foreign exchange reserves had lost more than half due to long-term trade surpluses and speculative purchases by the Japanese puppet regime. Some people speculated that our government had decided to change its policy of controlling foreign exchange, implementing currency devaluation, and even moving the agency supplying foreign exchange from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Furthermore, because all parties were eagerly awaiting the Ministry of Finance to announce the aftermath of this sharp change in the exchange rate, and the Ministry of Finance remained silent, not revealing any opinion in the past two and a half days, it made people even more suspicious, worried about whether there would be problems with the legal tender itself. In addition, the circulation of copper coins in Shanghai gradually contracted, and the public utility vehicle company explicitly revealed news of a shortage of copper coins. This strengthened the psychological hoarding of copper coins by all parties, and even led to the use of various substitutes, even using postal stamps for redemption. This made people worry about the future of the legal tender. Rumors of issuing banknotes and contracting five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender banknotes resurfaced.</p>
<p>Eight Pence and Import-Export Trade</p>
<p>The Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee ××××××××××× stabilized in the black market at the level of eight pence for more than nine months. At that time, there was no balance mechanism, so there was no balance operation relationship. The emergence and stability of this eight-pence black market rate was purely accidental, and there was no theoretical basis.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, and the use of this eight-pence black exchange rate as the standard for balanced conversion, had no basis other than assuming that it was equal to the purchasing power parity of the currency. But as mentioned earlier: The mission of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, in addition to eliminating speculative activities and reducing the losses of minor import exchanges not approved by the central government, was also to restrict various unnecessary imports and promote the export of local products.</p>
<p>However, according to the recent trend of sharp increase in import trade: This eight-pence black market exchange rate, which is lower than the official exchange rate, is obviously unable to restrain general import trade, especially in Shanghai: The import value in the first four months of this year reached 185.7 million yuan, nearly doubling from 68.7 million yuan in the same period last year, accounting for 46.8% of the total import value of the country.</p>
<p>But Completely Different from Devaluation</p>
<p>When the exchange rate in the black market drastically deviated from the official price after the implementation of foreign exchange controls last year, until the black market exchange rate naturally stabilized at the level of eight pence against the British pound; in the domestic academic community, there were many people who advocated appropriately lowering the official price. The reasons for advocating lowering the official price were nothing more than restricting imports and protecting domestic exports, so as to promote exports, and even attract remittances from overseas Chinese to return to the country as the most powerful measure. However, in addition to resolutely maintaining the external credit of the legal tender and never wanting to take any action on this, the government authorities have also been carrying out various means to achieve the above-mentioned goals in other aspects, and have achieved remarkable results. For example, very few importers can purchase foreign exchange at the official price, and most of them purchase it at a high price in the black market, which has invisibly restricted imports. At the same time, most of the domestic transportation tools are in the hands of the state, and the state naturally selects import goods according to their needs and the degree of need. Unnecessary and even unnecessary imported goods have also been strictly restricted in transportation. As for the purchase of military supplies from overseas, most of them have been implemented by means of barter. The determination of the prices of goods from each other does not require manipulation by devaluation policy. Therefore, it will no longer affect the development of export trade. As for the remittances of overseas Chinese returning to the country, there have been considerable gains in the development of patriotism alone, and the existence of the gray market is indeed enough for overseas Chinese to choose from.</p>
<p>In the face of these facts, since the government has no need to devalue the official price, then this contraction of the black market exchange rate by HSBC Bank is of course completely different from the devaluation policy. And we can obtain an opposite clear proof from the content of the second item in the statement of the Ministry of Finance spokesperson recorded above.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: At present, due to seasonal reasons, imports are quite large, especially the increase in imports of non-essential goods. Therefore, there is a basis for adjusting foreign exchange market prices on the basis of Chinese economic standards to maintain the balance of international payments. This clearly reveals that the future level of the stabilized black market price is quite different from the past in terms of policy.</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank has always maintained the official price of one shilling and two pence and will never change it. However, the Exchange Equalization Committee will abandon the past policy of freezing at a certain point (like pegging to eight pence) for equalization operations in the black market, and will adapt to circumstances according to the standards favorable to the Chinese economy and with reference to the seasonal relationship between imports and exports.</p>
<p>(2) Although the standard of equalization will be determined according to circumstances, it must be based on whether it is beneficial to the Chinese economy as the principle of selection. This is obviously completely different from the past pinning policy. Therefore, the new level that will appear in the future is not an unchangeable level. It can be smaller than eight pence, and it can also be larger than eight pence.</p>
<p>Crushing the Conspiracy of Japanese Puppet Regime's Speculative Purchases</p>
<p>Everyone knows: Japan relies on issuing non-convertible banknotes to plunder raw materials and local products from the occupied areas of China. In addition to transporting a part of them to Japan for consumption by its factories, it also resells another unnecessary part to Shanghai and other places, thereby absorbing legal tender to speculate on foreign exchange. Needless to say: This scheme of his must have the unlimited supply of the black market as a prerequisite, and at the same time, it must have a stable black market exchange rate to obtain full benefits. Especially in recent months, when the Japanese yen has sharply appreciated against the legal tender, and at the same time, the black market exchange rate of the legal tender has been stable for a long time, his necessity and profit of speculating on the legal tender foreign exchange have become even greater. According to recent reports: He is currently using this method to purchase large quantities of cotton and wheat from overseas on behalf of his factories in Shanghai: However, due to the contraction of the foreign exchange black market this time, it is impossible to import. From this, it can be seen that this sudden change is completely in line with the "anti-Japanese strategy."</p>
<p>However, merely contracting the black market exchange rate is absolutely not enough to combat the Japanese puppet regime's conspiracy to speculate on the legal tender foreign exchange. Unless we can also find ways to restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market at the same time. Although during the sharp changes in the exchange rate market, there was once a rumor that the location of foreign exchange supply would be moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong, there is no such indication in the statement of the Ministry of Finance spokesperson. Although this is a major regret, it is sufficient to reflect the government authorities' consideration of the convenience of Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, as well as to reflect the strength of China's foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<h3>The Political Education Work of a Model Teacher (3)</h3>
<p>— Xiang Rong</p>
<p>5. We should develop a heuristic teaching method, such as pre-setting assumptions and asking soldiers to handle them; or proposing three answers to a question and asking soldiers to think about which one is correct; or, when encountering a problem that is not easy to understand, making an appropriate analogy, etc.</p>
<p>6. After the purchase and teaching are completed, it is best to lead the soldiers to read the textbook several times. Although it is not rote learning, the way of reading can also help the soldiers understand and remember, especially the soldiers who do not know the words and cannot read by themselves.</p>
<p>7. The seriousness of classroom discipline and the improvement of soldiers' interest in class are not contradictory. That is to say, do not neglect to improve soldiers' interest in class because of the need to strictly enforce classroom discipline. How to improve soldiers' interest? For example, inserting some appropriate jokes in the teaching (jokes related to the course); making some gestures for some things that can be done with gestures, or calling everyone to stand up and sing when the soldiers feel tired, etc. These are all ways to improve interest.</p>
<p>(7) Extracurricular Discussion</p>
<p>1. After each class, extracurricular discussions should be held in units of squads during self-study time. The advantage of holding discussions in units of squads is that everyone can speak, time can be saved, and the method is much more active than platoon discussions.</p>
<p>2. Therefore, each research group should have one study group leader, who should be appointed by someone with a high level of political and cultural knowledge to lead the discussion meetings of each squad.</p>
<p>3. If there are problems that cannot be solved at the discussion meeting, then temporarily ask cadres above the platoon to make a conclusion, or leave it to be solved during the review the next day.</p>
<p>4. Instructors and teachers should convene the study group leaders of each squad before the discussion meeting to hold a preparation meeting, instructing them on how to conduct the discussion in order to improve the ability of the study group leaders.</p>
<p>(8) Review:</p>
<p>In order to deepen education, in addition to improving teaching methods and holding extracurricular discussions, the education progress should not be too fast. Our rule is: one day of class, one day of review. The review is still held in units of companies, reviewing the class taught yesterday. How to review?</p>
<p>(9) Auxiliary Education:</p>
<p>1. The layout of the salvation room of the company should be suitable for the content of daily education, so as to achieve the role of assisting military, political and cultural education.</p>
<p>2. Political organs must regularly produce some auxiliary teaching materials (such as wall charts, songs, and scripts, etc.) according to the content of education for use by companies.</p>
<p>(10) Testing:</p>
<p>1. Individual temporary oral tests are held by company and platoon cadres at any time in order to understand the degree of understanding of the soldiers in a timely manner.</p>
<p>2. Regular tests can be held once a week or every two weeks. Each company takes turns to test one established squad.</p>
<p>(11) Education in the Environment of Marching and Combat</p>
<p>The peacetime education system should be maintained in the environment of marching and combat, and should not be stopped. If the marching distance is within 60 li, one class can still be held (one day for military and one day for politics). The class time can be reduced to about half an hour, and the content can be reduced appropriately.</p>
<p>2. The content of education in the environment of marching and combat should focus on explaining the tasks and precautions of marching and combat. If the marching period is longer, then after the temporary teaching materials are completed, continue to carry out the regular teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. In the environment of marching and combat, attention should be paid to the use of free time (such as rest during marching, waiting for opportunities or defending during combat), but in principle, attention should be paid to not affecting combat tasks, not increasing the fatigue of soldiers, and adopting more flexible and active methods (such as holding in units of squads, holding on the spot at the position on the battlefield, holding in the sentry post, and using singing, storytelling, guessing riddles, etc.).</p>
<p>(12) Education of Miscellaneous Personnel:</p>
<p>Miscellaneous personnel in the company refer to cooks. Why should they be specifically mentioned? Because they cannot participate in the classes of ordinary soldiers due to their own duties, so there must be a separate plan.</p>
<p>Should miscellaneous personnel take classes in units of battalions or companies? We chose the method of taking classes in units of companies. What time should it be held? After dinner is the most suitable. What is the progress? One class per day (two political, two military, one health per week), about half an hour each time, and the content can be reduced to half of that of ordinary soldiers.</p>
<p>(13) Education Preparation Meeting</p>
<p>The education preparation meeting is convened for the lecturers before class. It is held in units of battalions, and the instructors and teachers of each company attend. It is presided over by the battalion instructor. The preparation meeting is held once a week, first summarizing the education of the previous week, and then preparing the education for this week. The matters to be prepared are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Unified interpretation of the content of political education this week;</p>
<p>2. Formulation and supply of auxiliary materials for political education this week.</p>
<p>(14) Extracurricular Political Education</p>
<p>What has been said above is mostly about the specific problems of attending political classes. Political class is regarded as in-class education in the troops. In addition, there is extracurricular political education. What are the contents of extracurricular political education and what methods are used to carry it out?</p>
<p>1. Soldiers' Congress, held in units of companies, battalions, or regiments. All members must attend. This meeting is convened to convey a certain important political issue, or to explain the specific tasks of the unit, or to discuss the daily work and life of the company (in the soldiers' congress of the company). The soldiers' congress in the company unit is held once every two weeks. The ones in the battalion unit and regiment unit are irregular, but there is at least one every month.</p>
<p>2. Question and Answer Evening Party, held in units of companies. All company soldiers participate. A more active way is adopted to deepen the education of a certain important political issue. At this kind of party, some questions are formulated in advance, asked, and designated to answer. Rewards are stipulated for correct answers (such as peanuts and melon seeds), and punishments are imposed for wrong answers (punishments for singing, punishments for doing ventriloquism, etc.). The company question and answer evening party is held irregularly, but there must be one every month.</p>
<p>3. Evening Party: Conducted in units of battalions or regiments, the main content is the performance of songs, dances, and dramas. Although this kind of party is entertaining, it also has great educational significance. There is no propaganda team (and theater company) in each regiment in the troops, so the company soldiers can see a play once every other week.</p>
<p>4. Commemorative Meeting: Held on commemorative days, in units of regiments, battalions, or companies, depending on the war situation at the time and the significance of the commemorative day.</p>
<p>5. Reading Newspapers: The division political department publishes a regular newspaper, once a week: The content of the newspaper, on the one hand, is to give a brief overview of the anti-Japanese situation, important domestic and international current affairs of the week; on the other hand, it is troop communications, about the practical experience and opinions of troop work.</p>
<p>6. Extracurricular Speeches: Regarding current affairs questions and the actual problems of the troops on a daily basis, which need to be educated among the soldiers, the division political organs compile speech materials and use extracurricular time or morning and evening roll call time to give speeches. This kind of speech is held irregularly, decided at any time, and then carried out at any time. It is not stipulated within the entire education plan.</p>
<p>B. Political Education of Cadres</p>
<p>The political education of cadres is divided into company and platoon levels, battalion and regiment levels, and division and brigade levels according to the differences in the political and cultural levels of cadres at all levels. At the same time, because the work of cadres at all levels is different in complexity, and the ability of self-study is also strong and weak, the methods of implementation are also different.</p>
<p>(1) Political Education of Company and Platoon Cadres:</p>
<p>1. The political education of company and platoon cadres is held once a week (with another military education), gathering in battalion units for class. The lecturers are the teachers of each battalion.</p>
<p>2. The educational materials have been said above. What needs to be said here is that, based on the existing materials, a concise and popular outline should be drawn up so that the lecturers can grasp the center and those who receive the education can easily understand, because the political and cultural level of the current company and platoon cadres is still not high in terms of reading ability.</p>
<p>3. The education method is to first explain by the lecturer, and then discuss in company units.</p>
<p>4. Testing can be held once every two weeks, not every week, because when cadres encounter testing, they often spend the whole day and night looking for materials and writing answers, thus hindering a lot of work. At the same time, the questions should also be more flexible: Some specific questions that connect theory to practice should be asked to avoid copying the textbooks on the one hand and rote memorizing the articles on the other hand without being able to apply them flexibly.</p>
<p>(2) Political Education of Battalion Cadres:</p>
<p>The general problems of the education of battalion cadres are similar to those of company and platoon cadres. The special ones are that the content should be deeper, the progress should be faster, but the number of classes should be less, and self-study should be more. Why? Because the political and cultural level of battalion cadres is higher, the practical experience is richer, and the problems seen are also more extensive, so the content must be deeper than that of company and platoon cadres, and the progress must be faster. At the same time, the education of battalion cadres is carried out in regiment units. Due to the relationship between stationing, they are often far apart, so the number of times should be less and self-study should be more. According to our regulations, battalion cadres have one week of military education and one week of political education, that is to say, political education is carried out once in two weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to attending classes, battalion cadres should also focus on self-study. How can they be helped to self-study? First, designate appropriate books for self-study; second, formulate some questions based on these books; third, organize them to collectively discuss; fourth, regularly check and supervise and answer some of their questions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding current affairs questions, we also adopted this method: the division political department printed and distributed the radio news received every day to the regiment and battalion (not to the company). The cadres at the regiment level held a current affairs forum once a week, summarizing the anti-Japanese situation, important domestic and international events of the week, and exchanging opinions. In this way, on the one hand, the cadres can be promoted to study current affairs questions, and at the same time, they can provide preparations for reporting to the lower levels.</p>
<p>(3) Political Education of Division and Brigade Cadres:</p>
<p>According to our current situation, I am afraid that the higher the political education, the more difficulties there will be. Why? The first is because the more senior the cadres, the more questions they need to understand and the greater the requirements; the second is precisely because of the above reasons, so it is more difficult for the instructors; and the third is also because the comrades in the front lack educational experience.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, the political cadre education of the division and brigade mainly adopts the two methods of forum and self-study. The method of attending classes is more difficult.</p>
<p>The forum adopts the method of rotating reports. After the reporter's report, the comrades attending the meeting will supplement it. The forum is held at least once every two weeks. If there are temporary problems (such as relatively major current affairs problems in the group and internationally, etc.), it can be convened temporarily.</p>
<p>(4) Other</p>
<p>The political education of cadres at all levels mentioned above is all about carrying out work without leaving their posts. In addition, in order to train cadres, there are also educational and training classes that leave their posts and are specialized in training.</p>
<p>There are two types of training classes, one is opened for manufacturing cadres, and the time must be four months to six months, and the other is temporarily opened to strengthen the ability of current cadres, and the time can be from one month to two months.</p>
<p>C. Wartime Cultural Education</p>
<p>(1) Education Time: The weekly cultural education time is five times, with three literacy classes, one arithmetic class, and one natural knowledge class.</p>
<p>(2) Grouping: Because the cultural level of the soldiers is different, the literacy class should be divided into three types: A, B, and C. The arithmetic class can be divided into two groups, and the natural knowledge is not grouped. Group A: Can keep a diary and can read ordinary documents:</p>
<p>Group B: Can recognize more than 50 words:</p>
<p>Group C: Knows less than 50 words.</p>
<p>(3) Lecturer:</p>
<p>1. The instructor is responsible for natural knowledge;</p>
<p>2. The teacher and the clerk share the arithmetic;</p>
<p>3. The literacy classes of Group A and B are combined and the instructor is responsible. The clerk is responsible for Group C.</p>
<p>(4) Requirements: The literacy class of Group A focuses on solving the writing of lessons and teaching the methods of writing essays, diaries, and letters. Gradually teach them to fill in sentences, write essays, write letters, etc. When teaching new words, they must go through these three stages: first teach reading, first teach explanation, and third teach writing.</p>
<p>(5) Extracurricular Self-study: After class, soldiers should be mobilized to carry out extracurricular self-study. The self-study methods for literacy are practicing writing, playing literacy cards, keeping diaries, reading books, writing communications, etc., and the self-study methods for arithmetic can be mobilized to do arithmetic games.</p>
<p>D. Cultural Education of Cadres:</p>
<p>The cultural education of cadres does not use the method of attending classes, but uses the method of self-study. How to carry out self-study? The main ones are reading books, keeping diaries, etc. The self-study of company and platoon cadres is stipulated to be carried out during the political class and cultural class time of the soldiers, but it must be gathered in the company headquarters and guided by the instructor. The diary of the platoon-level cadres is the responsibility of the teacher of the company for revision, once every three days, and the diary of the company-level cadres is revised by the battalion instructor or a designated person, once a week.</p>
<p>Regarding the extracurricular work and entertainment work in the troops, as well as the organizational problems of leading the political education work in the troops, I will not talk about it here. Because these need to be discussed in a separate article.</p>
<p>To say one more thing, the above simple and shallow experience on the political education work in the troops is for the reference of the leading comrades in the anti-Japanese troops and the comrades who actually bear the political education work. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that everyone will exchange experiences so that the political education in the troops can be further improved.</p>
<h3>Lu Northwest Correspondence: A Record of Crossing the Yellow River Northward</h3>
<p>Seven: Night Meeting on the Embankment</p>
<p>In ××—that beautiful small town nestled against the Yellow River, we happily and systematically spent two full days. In the morning, when the sunlight of Di Tian shone on the river, emitting golden light waves, Secretary Tiao and we often climbed onto the large wooden boat moored on the shore and sang in unison. In the evening, again, our group would gather on the ×× that stretched far into the river to discuss issues and review our work. This made us forget the fatigue of running around to nearby villages during the day. We only felt the warmth of leisure, interest, and friendship. As night fell, the moon rose, shining a bright white light on the river. Secretary Yao and I sat on the earthen shoal by the river, waiting for all the comrades to come for a discussion meeting.</p>
<p>"Secretary Yao: You seem a bit down today. Why?"</p>
<p>"I'm not down," he denied.</p>
<p>I pressed him again, "Then why are you staring blankly into space?"</p>
<p>"I'm wondering if we should obey orders to retreat."</p>
<p>"Retreat?" I was shocked by his low voice. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Why? Because of orders! It's said that ×× has fallen, and ×× is in grave danger. Moreover, the situation in the city has been unclear for the past few days, and bandits have looted the city. Chief × just called, saying that there are orders from above for us to retreat to Henan immediately!" He said angrily, shaking his head with resentment.</p>
<p>"Are we just going to obey the orders and retreat?"</p>
<p>"I think we can solicit everyone's opinion…"</p>
<p>A fierce debate arose at the discussion meeting regarding this issue, but the majority of comrades advocated continuing forward. The reasons were: everyone knew from the beginning that the work of crossing the river would be difficult; if they were afraid of hardship, they shouldn't have come. Since they came, they were not afraid of hardship and shouldn't turn back halfway. Moreover, everyone was stirred by the secretary's words.</p>
<p>"First of all, everyone must know that × City is ours. Precisely because × City is in danger, we are even more needed to awaken and organize the good people and enable them to participate in the struggle to defend their homeland. This is a work of great significance… Assuming that Japanese soldiers have already occupied × City, we must still find a way to recapture it. Besides, it is now the bandits who are creating the tense atmosphere in × City. I think bandits are always Chinese people, not untamable beasts. And persuading them and winning them over to join the anti-Japanese front is the responsibility of our political workers…"</p>
<p>The sound of the river flowing at night was especially loud, accompanied by our impassioned shouts, creating a wonderful symphony.</p>
<p>"We want to go to × City!"—Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</p>
<p>"We will not retreat to Henan!"—Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! We will not retreat to Henan!"—Hooray!</p>
<p>The river seemed to understand human intentions, shouting loudly with us.</p>
<p>Under the silvery moonlight, we saw Secretary Yao waving his hand forcefully. This clearly showed his decisiveness.</p>
<p>"Comrades! Since you all agree to go to × City, then we will decide to leave tomorrow. However, everyone must have a firm will and the determination to live and die with × City. If anyone lacks the perseverance and doesn't dare to go, he can voluntarily report to me tonight. I will give him the necessary travel expenses and send him back to Jinan for retraining. In any case, don't sneak away…"</p>
<p>To × City!</p>
<p>The next day, we bravely and decisively embarked on the road to × City. Not a single person asked to return to Henan. The only five female comrades in the team were even more energetic and excited. The comrades marched in step, singing powerful songs.</p>
<p>Let's go to × City,</p>
<p>Toward the battlefield of national liberation!…</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Tianjin Crisis and Britain</h3>
<p>"When can the British government revitalize Britain's prestige?"</p>
<p>This was a question posed in Parliament by British Member of Parliament Ponsonby to the British authorities. We are thousands of miles away from Britain and unable to witness the scene firsthand. However, in a gentleman's country, a model of political deliberation, at a time when the world is watching, under a solemn atmosphere, there was actually such a question. How can one not imagine the questioner's emotions, how depressed, how bewildered, how blood surging, how tearful. For the British people and even friends of Britain, all who love Britain, there is probably no one who does not have such doubts, no one who does not sympathize with this question. At that time, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, who represented the government at Parliament, remained silent and did not report. Alas, what a scene, what an omen, in that moment of silence? ××××××××××××××××××× Those who love Britain are filled with doubt, and those who envy Britain coldly watch its decline. Have you heard what the German Sea News Agency reported from London on the 14th? It described the Tianjin crisis, saying, "The prestige of the Great British Empire depends on the success or failure of this matter!" It said that the Germans today are mocking, stimulating, and awakening the British in their bewilderment and distress in order to urge Britain to be tougher on Japan. There is no reason, no event, to force them to do so. Those who love and those who envy speak in unison, observe in unison. This is heaven's law and absolute truth.</p>
<p>The outcome of the Tianjin crisis is unpredictable. It is in the process of evolving. As of the time this reporter is holding his pen, there are not only no signs of easing, but it is also reported that Japan, in addition to implementing a blockade of the British and French concessions, is even preparing to use 50,000 Japanese residents and 2,000 reserve soldiers to enter the British concession as a pretext for sweeping graves. The intentions shown by the authorities there are even more extreme. As the military spokesman said, Britain is required to recognize the East Asian New Order proposed by Japan. As the Foreign Ministry spokesman said, Britain must guarantee not to interfere in Japan's Far East policy anymore. As newspaper editorials said, foreign concessions in China have proven to be the biggest obstacle to Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia. Therefore, they should all be abolished. In all these statements, we don't need to analyze their meaning or clarify their impact. Even the most foolish person can directly understand their desires from their words. We only want to add one more word: these are all reports from various international news agencies in Tokyo in recent days. They must have been widely published in newspapers around the world in recent days. They are confirmed news. Therefore, it is said that not only are there no signs of easing, but the situation is becoming increasingly serious and even extreme. This is to be expected.</p>
<p>World public opinion, the governments and the public of various countries, are all expressing anxiety about the Tianjin situation. Some are deliberately showing restraint and slightly optimistic. On the contrary, in Britain, the desires publicly stated by Japan and the rejection of arbitration methods are all ignored. It is said that the matter will be resolved through diplomatic channels. It is also said that Japan does not want to cause new disputes in the Far East, and Britain is working hard to deal with European events, so it also wants to avoid disputes. Those who make this statement, need not be doubted for the source of their news or their nationality, nor need be praised for their extraordinary generosity, are insufficient to represent British public opinion, and even less can this be seen as a sign of easing. According to yesterday's final news from London, the British government has indeed considered implementing economic retaliation against Japan, strengthening practical assistance to China, and inviting the United States to join forces because of the Tianjin crisis. Members of Parliament are running around, and the authorities are nervous. The details of the events and people involved are as detailed as they are in today's newspapers. Indeed, there is a sense of a storm coming. If this is promoted, the coast of the East Sea may not be spared a temporary and painful sacrifice, but the various existing treaties related to the Far East will therefore be preserved, the two-year war will therefore be easier to end, international justice and human righteousness will therefore be restored, and Britain's prestige will therefore shine with its full glory.</p>
<p>Although the British government's proposed plans are as described above, and the inevitable outcome of promoting them is so, the actual outcome is still unknown. Why? Because action will depend upon deliberation, but deliberation may not lead to action. During this period, the devil, Japan, implemented a blockade of the Tianjin concession, especially favoring American expatriates, while the isolationist faction in America attempted to blockade President Roosevelt. As a result of the influence, the British policy was hesitant and courage was weakened. This is one devil far away. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union desperately need each other, both in Europe and in the Far East. Since this has been the case, the Tianjin crisis proves it even more so. However, the United Kingdom has a haunted heart when it comes to allying with the Soviet Union. ××××××××××××. As a result, the most helpful factor for the stability of the Far East is weakened by this mutual distrust. This is the second devil nearby. The United Kingdom has been publicizing various proposals against Japan recently. If they can be implemented, they will definitely be effective. However, the traditional British idea is that simply talking about them is enough to make Japan know what to fear. Therefore, implementation is not considered a necessary action, and publicity is considered an effective method. Although the British are the most practical nation in the world and despise politicians and propagandists who only talk and do not act, they are blinded by their traditional self-esteem, overestimating themselves, and always believe that the publicity they make is different from others because it has the backing of strength. The audience must know what to fear, and fear is effectiveness. How could the entire nation of Japan, in evaluating the United Kingdom, not be as high as the United Kingdom evaluates itself? Moreover, the military in power in Japan, in evaluating the United Kingdom, is not as high as the steady faction in Japan evaluates the United Kingdom. Because of this discrepancy, what the United Kingdom wants to achieve with its "proposals" is what Japan uses to...</p>

<h3>Prelude to the Major Battle in Southern Shanxi: Over ×10,000 Troops Converge on Yuanqu in Seven Routes; Hebei-× Feigns Movement to Restrain Our Troops in Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] According to reports, × troops, under the cover of aircraft and warships, forcibly landed near Shantou on the morning of the day before yesterday and surrounded the city, pushing forward. The garrison troops resisted bravely. The fierce battle is still in progress. To understand the battle situation and the intentions of the × people, the reporter visited the military authorities and asked about everything. According to a spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission, the attack on Shantou by the × troops was expected. Our troops in the area had already made preparations and deployed strictly. Therefore, in addition to giving an unexpected blow to the landed × troops, they are still concentrating their forces and fighting fiercely with them near Shantou, striving to achieve our predetermined goal of consuming the × troops. As for the occupation of Shantou by the × troops, from a military point of view, it has no value. Shantou has long been a dead port. Everyone knows that the × side's claim to cut off our country's import of military equipment is nothing more than self-deception. Therefore, the occupation of the area by the × people is the same as the occupation of other coastal commercial ports. Their main attempt is not military, but economic. It is their main purpose to invade the rights and interests of various countries along the Pacific coast and drive out European and American forces in China, in order to realize their ambition to dominate East Asia and establish the so-called "New Order in East Asia." Since the × troops occupied Hainan Island, their active restlessness towards our coastal ports, such as Gulangyu, Shanghai, and Tianjin, shows that the invasion and occupation of Shantou also has no small international significance. In short, the recent major commotion of the × troops is just enough to prove that they are struggling in dire straits. Our troops will give × a severe blow in accordance with the pre-determined plan and promote the early collapse of the government.</p>
<p>× Offensive in Southeast Shanxi</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 21st] In the southern Shanxi area, □□15,000 troops and many aircraft have launched seven offensives against Zhongtiao Mountain in four routes since the 20th, attempting to converge on Yuanqu. The battle is fierce and unprecedented. It is estimated that 2,230,000 troops from Jiangxian County are invading Suicun and Dongjing Village in the east. Our troops are meeting them in battle. It is reported that 4,500 troops from Wenxi are invading Dianshang and Shangxia Yin (both southwest of Hengling Pass). Another force of 1,000 troops is joining forces with 1,000 troops from the south of Hengling Pass and harassing Yanjia Mountain. Our troops are bravely meeting them in battle, engaging in hand-to-hand combat several times, killing many × troops. They are currently engaged in a fierce battle with × troops in a certain area northwest of Gaoluo Town. 5,600 troops from Yanzhang, Xiaxian County, invaded the Yamaguchi area in separate routes on the morning of the 21st and engaged in fierce battles with our garrison troops on Tangwang Mountain, Heights 1526, Shengcheng Ridge, Fanjia Cha, Shangjia Bu, Fanjia Yao, and Shangxia Jiao Miao. This battle was the most intense. In the Tangwang Mountain Haocheng Ridge area, × troops relied on aircraft and artillery fire to launch a fierce attack on us. A senior military commander of our army personally went to the front line to supervise the battle, charging back and forth. Corpses piled up like mountains. The casualties of both sides were heavy after a day of battle. At the moment, we are firmly defending the area south of □□ and continuing the fierce battle. A certain unit of our army has divided and bypassed the flanks of the × army and will launch a large-scale encirclement and annihilation of the × army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun told reporters today that Japan's occupation of Shantou has no impact on the war situation. However, one point is noteworthy: the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou is a prelude to an operation against Hong Kong. Because Japan will definitely take action against Hong Kong when the time is right.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 23rd] The × troops who launched a four-pronged attack on Yuanqu have had fierce battles on each front since the 20th. The enemy who invaded southward from Yanjia Mountain has gradually increased to 6,700. In order to avoid unnecessary losses in positional warfare, our army made a planned transfer. Gaoluo Town (north of Yuanqu) was captured on the night of the 20th. Yuanqu was captured on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 23rd] A certain military observer said that the purpose of the × troops' attack on Yuanqu is still to "sweep away" our strength in Zhongtiao Mountain and shake our guerrilla base in order to achieve their goal of opening up the Baicheng-Jin Highway and stabilizing the southeastern Shanxi border. Yuanqu has been captured several times, but it was forced to retreat in no more than half a month. Judging from past facts, it is expected that the army there will suffer another defeat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 23rd] Approximately 10,000 troops from Wutai, Mengxian, Pinging, and Jingjing and Yangshan in western Hebei launched six attacks on our eastern Shanxi border starting on the 18th. On the 19th, 2-3,000 troops from Wutai, carrying several cannons and under the cover of three aircraft, attacked the areas of Yaotou Jiaochang, Chenjiazhuang, and Bailan Town (south of Wutai). Our troops fought bravely and the battle was extremely fierce. After holding out until evening, the × troops still failed to succeed. Until noon on the 20th, the × troops, because of the difficulty of advancing from the front, copied and attacked us from the left and right wings, attempting to encircle our army. At the same time, four aircraft wantonly bombed our villages and towns. At 3:00 p.m., they transferred to the highlands northeast of Bailan. The × troops then invaded Bailan and Wangcheng Village. Currently, × and we are engaged in a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Battles Reported on Shantou Periphery</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shantou, 23rd] Japanese troops completed their occupation of Shantou this morning. The retreating Chinese troops, in accordance with the scorched earth policy, set fires and destroyed the city walls. The flames blazed fiercely, and the sky was red for several miles. Countless warehouses and houses have been burned down and are still burning. The water plant has also been burned down and cut off.</p>
<p>[Dalu News Agency, Xingen Urgent News] After our army withdrew from Shantou, it is now guarding the defense line from Anbu to Jinsha City, and the Yixi line and Chaoyang form an outer ring surrounding Shantou. Japanese transport ships brought more than a thousand cavalrymen and many armored vehicles, preparing to break through our defense line and cut off the eastern trunk line. Our military and political authorities have now retreated to a certain place to command. The Japanese army, led by Iijima, launched a fierce attack on Anbu yesterday morning. Our defending troops stood their ground, dying to defend their position. The × troops suffered considerable casualties. A small number of × troops are now emerging northeast of Anbu. We are prepared and will definitely not let them succeed. According to reliable news, a certain army of ours has dispatched a large army in three routes to provide assistance. The vanguard troops arrived yesterday and adopted an arc-shaped encirclement line against the × troops in Shantou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chaoan, 23rd] The × troops who invaded Shantou launched a four-pronged attack on the 23rd: (1) They invaded Dahao from Donghu. After our fierce resistance, many × troops were killed. The × troops then reinforced several hundred and bombarded us with dense artillery fire. Due to terrain constraints, our army transferred to the west bank of Dahao in the evening and is engaged in a fierce battle with × troops. (2) More than 600 × troops invaded from Sijiwei and are currently engaged in a fierce battle with us in Xincun Yangcun (about four or five li northwest of Sijiwei). (3) In the Qilu Airport area in the eastern district of Shantou, the × troops used a combined attack by land, sea, and air, but our army still held the position and the × troops could not advance an inch. Shantou was still in our hands at 8:00 p.m. (4) The × infantry and cavalry who repeatedly circled and invaded Anbu were defeated and fled after our head-on attack. They then used more than 20 small motorboats at about 11:00 p.m. on the 22nd to carry several hundred × soldiers and attacked along the river. They were intercepted by our army in Yangxi (east of Guangbu). A mixed battle broke out between the two sides.</p>
<h3>Foreign Observers Talk About Guerilla Warfare in Shanxi: Japanese Like Fish in a Net, Wanting to Escape but Unable to; Our Armories Densely Distributed in Remote Areas</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chengdu Correspondence] A foreign neutral observer, after touring the northwest guerrilla area, returned to Chengdu. According to his words, "The Japanese army in Shanxi is like a big fish in a net. Although it can jump around, it cannot escape in the end. The railway in Shanxi is in the hands of the Japanese, but nothing is gained on both sides of the railway line. The east and west sides of the Japanese army are all guerrilla worlds. The combat experience of the guerrillas is becoming richer and their tactics are becoming more effective. They oppress the Japanese army whenever they have a chance. The Japanese army's combat has no important goals, so morale is low. The guerrillas often attack in small groups, luring the Japanese army away from its nest, and then destroying its fortifications and taking away military equipment. Sometimes, large groups of people sneak into the rear of the Japanese army, ambush secretly, and send someone to shout and challenge the Japanese army. When the Japanese army goes out to search, the challengers avoid entering the mountains, and the ambush troops rise up and annihilate the Japanese army. The guerrilla leaders know that they cannot drive out the × troops by relying solely on guerrilla tactics, but they are still confident that, over time, an industrialized country like Japan will perish. The guerrillas' supplies are quite abundant. Before I arrived in a certain place in Shanxi, the guerrillas suddenly removed about fourteen miles of railway tracks controlled by the Japanese and recast them into bullets and weapons in their small armories. These small armories are distributed throughout Shanxi and are numerous. After the Japanese army's armored vehicles and tanks are captured by the guerrillas, they are also used in the same way. The terrain in the guerrilla area is not suitable for armored vehicles. There are no national currencies in the front line of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces for fear of falling into the hands of the Japanese. The soldiers use provincial banknotes, which cannot be exchanged for foreign exchange even if they are obtained by the Japanese. Everything is very active in the 8th Route Army defense area. Road construction projects are being carried out in all directions, and the expenses are provided by the central government. There are no Soviet advisers in the 8th Route Army. This is one interesting fact I discovered.</p>
<h3>Soviet Aircraft Bomb Puppet Territory: Kwantung Army Communiqué</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd] A Kwantung Army communiqué received here today stated that Outer Mongolian and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly challenged the Japanese and "Manchukuo" forces. Since Monday, more than a dozen Soviet aircraft have repeatedly crossed the border and bombed various places in "Manchukuo". The "Manchukuo" government lodged a protest on Monday.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Japanese Consul Rejects: Three-Nation Protest: The Gulangyu Food Problem Has Not Been Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd] The consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Gulangyu recently jointly sent a note to the Japanese authorities, stating the serious situation of the lack of food in the concession. The Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen replied to this note in writing yesterday, saying that this situation is "unavoidable".</p>
<h3>British and American Warships Sail to Shantou: British Nationals Ordered to Stop Evacuation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Shanghai Foreign News: British and American warships berthed in Shantou have not agreed to Japan's request to leave the port. All foreign nationals have not evacuated. The American destroyer USS Pillsbury arrived in Shantou, while the American warship USS Pope and the British warship HMS Scout arrived this afternoon. In addition, the American destroyer USS Asheville is heading to Shantou from Hong Kong. According to sources in Shantou, the Japanese side has announced that warships and other ships of various countries and nationals of various countries must leave Shantou today. The United Kingdom had evacuated some women and children, but stopped slightly after receiving instructions from Shanghai, because the British authorities firmly believe that once they evacuate, it will cause difficulties when returning to Shantou in the future, as in other places in China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Shanghai News: British Consul General Philip recently sent a note to the Japanese authorities on the matter of the Japanese side's request for British nationals and British warships in Shantou to withdraw before 1:00 p.m. today, submitting a reply, the general meaning of which is the same as the reply from U.S. Commander of Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, briefly stating that British nationals in Shantou have the full right to remain there, Shantou is a commercial port, and British ships also have the right to sail there to engage in trade. The Japanese side's request is difficult to accept.</p>
<h3>Situation of Foreign Nationals in Tianjin Increasingly Difficult: British Nationals Forced to Strip Naked; Soviet Women Suffer the Most Insults</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Tianjin News: The Japanese side continues to discriminate against British nationals and has imposed particularly brutal behavior on British nationals yesterday. Yesterday morning, three British nationals, one was Dan Wesi, one was Muse, and the other was Laut, planned to enter Special District One. When Dan Wesi arrived at the blockade line, the Japanese side approved his passage without obstruction. However, when Muse and Laut stepped forward to wait for inspection, the Japanese army immediately asked, "Are you British?" The two immediately replied, "Yes." The Japanese army immediately ordered them to take off their clothes in front of the wooden fence in front of a large group of Chinese women and children, stark naked. The search of the two men's clothes was especially thorough. The Japanese soldiers also ordered Laut to open his mouth, and Laut immediately did so. The Japanese soldiers ordered him to open it wider. Laut, having already opened it to the maximum extent, feared that it would be difficult to obey. The Japanese sentry immediately placed Laut's pass in his mouth, forcing him to open it wider. Laut's hair was also pulled off by Japanese soldiers. After the Japanese soldiers checked the clothes of the two men, they also ordered each of them to spread their legs and searched back and forth for a quarter of an hour before allowing them to pass. British Consul Jameson has protested to the Japanese side about this. According to reliable news, there was another incident of Japanese soldiers brutally insulting British nationals yesterday. Five British engineers and workers from the Beining Railway, including Chief Engineer Willis and Accounting Director Burton, planned to go to the office in the public service room yesterday via the International Bridge. Those traveling with them were French nationals. When they arrived at the blockade line, the Japanese soldiers immediately approved the French nationals to pass, but the five British nationals were all ordered to take off their clothes by the Japanese soldiers and were thoroughly searched. A large number of Chinese people were also present at the time. Also, a British worker from Magalli, yesterday while walking through the Ma Baodao blockade line, was ordered by Japanese sentries to take off his clothes and searched naked before being allowed to pass. Two five-yuan French banknotes beside him were also taken away by Japanese soldiers. Also, Ms. Duan Tesheng, a British national, planned to pass through the blockade line from the British Concession to her residence outside the concession yesterday. After being searched by a Chinese female police officer, Duan Tesheng planned to return home. Unexpectedly, the Japanese sentry ordered her to take off her clothes. Upon hearing this, Duan Tesheng ran wildly back to the British Concession.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 23rd] According to eyewitnesses, approximately 200 Soviet citizens residing in Dagu were subjected to even more unbearable insults when the Japanese army inspected them, especially Soviet women.</p>
<h3>×Anti-British Rally: The British Concession on Alert</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A foreign dispatch from Tianjin reports that an anti-British rally will be held in the occupied area this afternoon. The authorities of the British Concession are apprehensive that this may lead to violent acts of assault on the Concession. Therefore, since this morning, they have intensified security within the Concession. At the same time, special forces have been dispatched to the vegetable market to protect the merchants and residents there, because the vegetable vendors in the market have been intimidated by Japanese and Korean individuals, who have threatened that if they continue to supply vegetables to foreigners, harm will come to them and their families. They have reported this situation to the British authorities, so special personnel have been sent to protect them today. No beef is sold in the British Concession today, and chicken, fish, and other fresh vegetables are also lacking. The sausage workshops in the Concession have decided to temporarily suspend business due to a shortage of raw materials. According to foreigners entering the Concession today, inspections have become stricter, and all identification documents are being closely examined. Several German residents were also checked by the Japanese army today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the Japanese anti-British propaganda is intensifying, even to the point of personally attacking the leaders of the British community here. Moreover, those engaged in this propaganda are not limited to Chinese newspapers; Russian newspapers are also involved. Anti-British propaganda can be seen everywhere within the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and the Japanese and their employed Chinese henchmen are sparing no effort in promoting it. The Japanese government-controlled Chinese newspapers publish lengthy articles every day, depicting how Britain has committed all kinds of evils in China, thereby urging the Chinese people to oppose Britain unanimously. The newspapers also demand that the British hand over the British Concession and state that all Chinese should immediately cease trading with British merchants.</p>
<h3>Female Guerrilla Leader, Cai Jinhua, Rumored to Have Married a Military Doctor</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shanghai, 20th Dispatch] According to foreign news, Ms. Cai Jinhua, famous throughout the country for commanding guerrilla forces in the Taihu area, is rumored to have recently married a military doctor surnamed Wu. It is said that Cai and her female comrade, Ms. Zhang, disguised themselves as peasant women and infiltrated the city of Wuxing in Zhejiang to post slogans. They did this for three days and, thanks to local farmers hiding them, they did not encounter any accidents. Before they left, they used four hand grenades to "treat" the camp of the * army. The * pursued them out of the camp, and Cai was unfortunately shot in the leg, but still managed to escape. She sought medical treatment at a rear hospital in Ningguo, Anhui, where she developed feelings for Dr. Wu and eventually married him. It is said that Cai's former husband was also a guerrilla leader who was killed by the *. It is said that Wu and she share the same aspirations and will work together to drive out the * invaders.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the increasing number of Japanese residents in the International Settlement, is offering cash rewards to British and other foreign employees in the police force to learn Japanese.

<h3>British Financial Expert Discusses Chinese and Japanese Finance: The Steps Taken by China Show Great Foresight; Japan's Cash and Foreign Exchange Are About to Be Exhausted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Today, financial writers have made detailed discussions on the currency system of the Far East. All writers agree that China's strict measures to escape the legal tender are necessary. At the same time, the bankers completely deny the rumors that the "equalization fund" has consumed too much. Some bankers believe that the Equalization Fund Committee has great foresight and that the strategy it has adopted is sufficient to reject speculators. The Times said, "Under the current situation, managing China's foreign exchange and currency system is more difficult than in any other country in the world. It is amazing that China can maintain its currency system and foreign exchange without taking more strict restrictions!" The Financial News said: "Japan is stepping up its currency control, which is not surprising, according to Far Eastern people in London. Japan's cash and foreign exchange are being consumed very quickly, and they are about to run out."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 23rd] The Japanese yen continues to fall. Buyers can now purchase one Japanese yen for only 97 cents in Chinese national currency.</p>
<h3>General Association of Young Journalists Sends Condolences to Shanghai Press</h3>
<p>[National Salvation Society, Chongqing Dispatch] The General Association of Young Journalists of China, in view of the efforts and unwavering spirit of Shanghai friends and journalists struggling under the terror policies of * puppets, is inspiring the whole country. A telegram of condolence and encouragement was sent from Chongqing the other day. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Branch and All Unyielding News Colleagues in Shanghai:</p>
<p>In the past twenty-odd months, the resolute support for resistance and national construction and the relentless attacks on the traitorous regime by the three million residents of Greater Shanghai are due to the hard work style and the firm and accurate political leadership of the comrades. The glorious history of the comrades has been recorded on the indelible two pages in the course of the Chinese people's war of liberation. The excellent style of the comrades has set the most exemplary model among the new Chinese journalists. We would like to represent more than a thousand friends across China and call on all progressive journalists to pay our highest respect and sincere condolences to you.</p>
<p>Naturally, since Wang Ni arrived in Shanghai, using his past position and a large number of big and small traitors surrounding Wang Ni, such as Zhou Fohai, Chen Bijun, Tao**, Gao Zongwu, Chu**, etc., the comrades' work will encounter greater hardships and difficulties, and the comrades' environment will fall into greater dangers and uncertainties. We are always in remembrance of the safety and lives of the comrades, but sacrificing for the national liberation war is the highest morality and the minimum belief of the Chinese people today. In order to combat the shameless words and absurd propaganda of the * bandits and to stop the rise of all traitorous theories, we must overcome any difficulties, step over any hardships, and advance forward! Under the subject of the Chinese nation's liberation war, under the subject of striving for world peace and human happiness, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and pay any price of blood and flesh. We must fight to the end with * bandits and traitors!</p>
<p>Comrades! The heavier the oppression of us by the * bandits and traitors, the more it proves the glory and merits of our past history that cannot be buried. Today, on the eve of approaching dawn, we ask the comrades in Shanghai's press to grit their teeth, make persistent efforts, and consolidate our southeastern news fortress. We must not hesitate to strike at the rise of traitorous theories at any cost. We call on all progressive journalists in China and peace-loving press colleagues all over the world to be the support behind the comrades. From today, we must first call on the journalists under the banner of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association to do everything possible to support the comrades!</p>
<p>Comrades, the slogan we shout is: Do everything possible to consolidate Shanghai's anti-Japanese and national salvation press fortress, and do not hesitate to strike at the rise of traitors at any sacrifice. We respectfully pay tribute to the victory of the War of Resistance and National Construction!</p>

<h3>Returned Overseas Chinese from the United States Talk About the Anti-Japanese Movement in the United States</h3>
<p>Americans</p>
<p>[Min Ge She Dispatch] Ninety-nine percent of Americans sympathize with China's resistance against Japan. Usually, when they hear the news of "China's victory," they are overjoyed. Otherwise, even if it is a small defeat, they will feel as frustrated as the Chinese.</p>
<p>However, since the beginning of China's resistance against Japan, 54% of Japan's military raw materials are still supplied by the United States. Isn't this contradicting the original intentions of the Americans and helping the aggressors? Therefore, the "China Aid Council" and the "Friends of the Chinese People," two groups that regularly promote aid to China, are actively engaged in the movement to boycott Japanese goods. At the same time, they organized a "Committee to Boycott Japanese Goods" to undertake this work.</p>
<p>The director of this association is Robert Norton, the former editor of "Today China." Under his enthusiastic and capable leadership, much has been gained over the past year, but the intended purpose has not been achieved. Upon review, it was found that the previous work line was wrong:</p>
<p>Because of "boycotting Japanese goods", many American friends bought more goods from German and Italian aggressors under the belief of this slogan. This is indeed contrary to their "peace movement" and is opposed by the Jews. Therefore, from the second year onwards, the work line of this association became more active and has progressed from "boycotting Japanese goods" to boycotting the goods of aggressor countries.</p>
<p>According to the government report last December, only one of the twelve aircraft factories had a suspicion of exporting aircraft to Japan. This spring, the owner of this factory voluntarily announced that he had long stopped exporting aircraft to Japan (here, U.S. Secretary of State Hull's warning to manufacturers last July was a direct cause); and the export of raw materials to Japan has also been greatly reduced (here, the U.S. Department of Commerce's warning to merchants last summer that Japan's reserves are empty and that cash is required for delivery was a direct cause). All this proves that the effect of this movement is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>The United States cannot provide further assistance to China and suppress Japan because the "Neutrality Act" is in the way. Therefore, amending the "Neutrality Act" has become a consensus among most Americans. This spring, in response to this demand, under the leadership of former Secretary of State Stimson, a "Committee of Americans Who Do Not Participate in the Japanese Aggressor Movement" was formed to devote itself to this movement.</p>
<p>This association passed a concrete plan this year: if their work cannot use political means to amend the "Neutrality Act" before the congressional adjournment in July this year, they will implement an embargo on all military supplies and raw materials to the aggressors with the power of the masses. Using this method, after a considerable period of time, I believe that the purpose can also be achieved. On March 6 this year, the mayor of Akutoriya City in Northwest America automatically ordered that all industrial raw materials and military supplies could not be shipped to Japan through this port. This example shows the bright future of this movement. The masses of many other seaports are also actively carrying out this movement.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese resolutely advocate resistance and support resistance. Although they are all very loyal, their observations and actions are very correct. For example, Wang Ni, this political "prostitute", does not seem to be liked and sympathized by overseas Chinese in the United States. It is really pitiful for Wang Ni. The newspapers he used to run abroad are now not only not his mouthpieces, but also the vanguard of "villaging Wang". For example, the New York "Minqi Daily" used to be founded by him as the backstage boss, but before the "Yan Dian", when Wang Ni secretly interfered with "peace", it was the "Minqi Daily" that fired the first shot at Wang Ni. After the "Yan Dian" was published, the "Minqi Daily" stood on the position of the nation-state and attacked Wang Ni until he was "completely bruised". The sign of this "Minqi Daily" was originally Wang Ni's inscription, but it has been demolished since this spring.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese's national salvation organizations were initially very scattered, but with the progress of the war of resistance, the organizations have gradually become more advanced and consolidated. From the end of 1937 (four or five months after the start of the war), the entire U.S. Overseas Chinese established three supreme organizations for resisting Japan and saving the country:</p>
<p>(1) The All-American Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Fundraising General Association: The association's address is in New York. All anti-Japanese national salvation work of the East American Overseas Chinese is led and directed by this organization.</p>
<p>(2) Volunteer Donation Association: The association's address is in San Francisco, which is the highest organization for anti-Japanese national salvation of the West American Overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(3) Anti-Japanese National Salvation Fundraising Association: The association's address is in Chicago, which is the general agency for the anti-Japanese national salvation work of the Central American Overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>In addition to this, every small port with traces of overseas Chinese has organizations such as the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Support Association", which regularly undertakes the responsibility of resisting Japan and teaching the country.</p>
<p>Japanese Overseas</p>
<p>The invasion of China launched by the Japanese warlords this time not only did not benefit the Japanese people, but also increased their infinite suffering. This situation is the same at home and abroad. Therefore, the anti-war sentiment among Japanese overseas in the United States is also very high. The "Japanese Labor Association" leads this anti-war movement. This association has more than two hundred members.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident", their core members have joined the "Friends of the Chinese People", and they are constantly working to propagandize against the invasion of China. They often consult with members and some Japanese who truly love Japan to petition and demonstrate at the Japanese Consulate. At that time, the name they used was "Japanese Patriotic Association".</p>
<p>Once, the leader of this association,□□□, gave a street speech against Japan and in support of China. An American old woman asked him, "You are Japanese, why do you promote anti-Japan?" He replied, "I love the country." Then he gave a moving speech, saying that the invasion of China would ruin Japan's national fortune, and that only by opposing the war and helping China's resistance against Japan could the Japanese people have a way out.</p>
<p>The most courageous in this work is the Japanese female writer Ms. Matsui. She participated in all the work against the war of aggression and often gave speeches at various venues and streets; when she spoke passionately, she must have tears in her eyes, and the audience was moved. Therefore, the effect is also the greatest. After each speech, she must donate a sum of money to help China. The Japanese government has ordered her to be arrested and killed, but under the protection of justice, she is still working hard.</p>
<p>Koreans</p>
<p>For decades, Koreans have been subjected to cruel oppression and rule by * people and are always looking forward to liberation. Only when the Chinese nation is liberated can they and the Taiwanese be liberated. They understand this truth, so they are very sympathetic and helpful to our resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>In order to help China resist Japan in order to seek a way out for their own ethnic group, Koreans merged many small groups and organized the "Korean China Aid Federation."</p>
<p>In the past two years, they have done many things to help China resist Japan, especially in the performance of donations. They are continuing to work hard, and we believe that all Koreans will come into China's embrace in the future! [The above is a conversation between Mr. Zhu Yaoqu, an overseas Chinese living in the United States, recorded by Lin Lingjun]</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Expresses Patience While Awaiting Japanese Repentance; Members of the House of Commons Ask Questions One After Another, Unanimously Requesting Positive Action</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The British government previously inquired to the Japanese government about the Japanese side's final attitude towards the Tianjin incident, but has not yet received a reply from Tokyo. According to reliable sources, the British side is now planning to move the location of the negotiations on the Tianjin incident from Tianjin to Tokyo. At the same time, the British side plans to adopt various measures of economic sanctions against Japan, which have already been drafted. It is heard that the Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee will initiate a discussion on the Tianjin incident by member of parliament Molein, and then send a delegation to visit Prime Minister Chamberlain to petition. British people from all walks of life and members of various political parties have gradually felt that if the British government delays in taking resolute action, it is tantamount to encouraging the Japanese side to continue its atrocities. Not only will it not achieve satisfactory results, but it will also lead to aggressive acts elsewhere. Currently, British newspapers list the return of the British King and the events in Shantou and Swatow as equally important news. As for the matter of the Swatow Japanese naval authorities issuing an ultimatum to Britain and the United States, official reports have not yet been received here. The local authorities are currently handling the evacuation of British women and children from Swatow, but British officials believe that once the British expatriates withdraw from Swatow, it will be difficult to return in the future, because this is the situation elsewhere.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Today, in the British House of Commons, someone asked whether the Prime Minister would report on the situation of British expatriates in Tianjin. Chamberlain replied, "The perishable food supplies in the British concession in Tianjin are only about 10 percent of the normal supply. The British authorities are considering ways to remedy the lack of food. However, non-perishable foods, such as rice flour and wheat noodles, are still abundant. You must have all heard reports of the insults suffered by the British in Tianjin. Foreign Secretary Halifax has met with the Japanese Ambassador to present the negotiations on such incidents." Member of Parliament Adams asked whether the Prime Minister would notify Tokyo that this kind of action to insult the British would have a serious impact on Japanese expatriates in all British territories. Chamberlain replied, "Foreign Secretary Halifax will clearly express to the Japanese Ambassador the intolerable insults we have thought about." Then Henderson requested an explanation of the situation in Swatow after the Japanese side issued the ultimatum. The Prime Minister replied that he had not yet received official information, but according to news reports, the Japanese side seemed to have withdrawn its original intention and made some concessions. Bellington asked whether the Prime Minister was considering taking retaliatory steps immediately. Chamberlain replied, "No, I don't think it has reached such a serious stage." Halechi asked whether the Prime Minister knew that the British people were in high spirits and did their best to support the Prime Minister's words on dealing with the intolerable insults. Chamberlain did not respond to this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the situation in the Far East in the House of Commons today, saying, "The British government has made preparations to evacuate British women and children in Swatow. The necessary merchant ships have now gone to Swatow. The Japanese naval authorities have agreed to facilitate the evacuation of British expatriates in Swatow and will also respect British industries. As for the situation in Tianjin, it has not changed. Obstacles to the entry and exit of British people still require strict searches. Although the import of food into the concession has been delayed, it is still sufficient. Many British expatriates in Tianjin are now going to the beach to escape the summer heat. The British authorities have prepared everything for them, and the first batch of personnel have already set off. The British warship "Saint Weiji" arrived in Tianjin on the 20th, and the "Loweistodoff" ship, which was originally planned to go elsewhere, is still berthed there." Then, Labor Party member Greenwood asked whether the Prime Minister would take stronger action in view of the repeated occurrence of invasive acts to express the British government's disgust for this. In his reply, Chamberlain asked Greenwood to relieve his mind, saying that the British government is paying great attention to this matter. As far as the Tianjin issue is concerned, the situation is extremely serious, but the British government still hopes that it can be resolved locally. If negotiations fail, the British government will consider further measures. Conservative Party member Milner asked if the Prime Minister had seen the Japanese side's news that British Ambassador Craig had visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and asked him to show great mercy and suspend the Japanese side's actions. The Prime Minister replied that it could be seen as fabricated just from its appearance. Labor Party member Beck said that this kind of infringement on the rights and interests of foreigners is actually a prelude to the monopolization of the Far East. Chamberlain said that he hoped that the facts in the future would not be as Beck expected, otherwise the situation would be extremely serious.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported in the House of Commons yesterday the latest news on the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, generally meaning that there was no progress in the Japanese restrictions. Mr. Zhang also said that the Japanese army landed near Shantou on the morning of the 21st. The Japanese side has agreed to respect British property. The British warship "Scut" has just arrived in Shantou. Another ship, "Sloot," arrived there today. The food problem on Gulangyu is getting worse. The food source from Daman and the mainland has been cut off. However, third-country ships are currently having no difficulty buying food.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] The Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee held a non-opening conference this afternoon to discuss the Far East issue. They immediately listened to the report of Member of Parliament Molein and then discussed the Tianjin incident. The details of the process have not been published.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Times said in its editorial today, "The Japanese army's occupation of Swatow will not cause serious international problems, because there is a foreign concession there. The purpose of the Japanese army's move is very clear. Swatow is the only important port in China currently. The Japanese army's occupation of it is intended to cut off the region's foreign trade and the supply of military supplies from abroad." Then, Chamberlain's statement on the Tianjin incident was mentioned, saying, "If the negotiations on the Tianjin incident do not achieve satisfactory results, the government will consider further steps." The newspaper commented, "Public opinion is welcoming the government to provide assurances that it has been studying retaliatory steps in the nine days since Tianjin was blocked."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Famous political commentator Dunardi wrote in "Le Temps" today, "Recent events in the Far East will make the United States participate in the execution of the German and Italian instructions and destroy the honor of the American flag. It has made the United States participate in the defense of democratic interests in the Far East. The German and Italian sides may not be happy about this kind of action by Japan."</p>
<h3>France Endeavors to Improve Franco-Spanish Relations, Prepares to Return Spanish Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 23rd] According to well-informed sources here, the French Ambassador to Spain, Pétain, visited Finance Minister Reynaud on Thursday and held lengthy talks. It is heard that the main issue of the talks was to discuss the return of Spanish gold reserves in France and French loans to Spain. It is said that the French government has now decided to accelerate the return of the gold reserves to Spain and recognizes that loans to Spain are necessary. Therefore, it can restore initiative and urge the French government to accept the Franco-Spanish exchange. The general public recognizes that Spain's demands and the steps taken to improve Franco-Spanish relations, changed to Ambassador Pétain is the person in charge of the two issues.</p>
<h3>Shantou Situation: Hull Is Calm, No Plans to Negotiate With Tokyo for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference a few days ago that he maintains a calm attitude towards the situation in Swatow and that the State Department does not intend to negotiate with Tokyo on this matter for the time being.</p>
<h3>German Side Propaganda Large Quantities of Military Supplies Transported to Poland</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 23rd] According to reliable sources here, several ships have recently arrived at Gdynia Port, fully loaded with war materials. The Polish ship "Lublin" recently transported a large number of military weapons. The American ship "Momapu" also unloaded a large number of light tanks, aircraft, and aircraft engines on the 21st of this month. In addition, several British ships also arrived, carrying a large amount of goods. The ships unload their cargo at night. It is said that the goods are actually heavy and light artillery tanks.</p>
<h3>British King and Queen Return to London: Enthusiastic Welcome from the Public and Loyalty Oaths from Parliament</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The HMS Queen Mary arrived in Southampton yesterday. The two princesses boarded the destroyer HMS "Cope Thorne" to greet them, and dined with the King and Queen. This was the most enjoyable event of the entire trip for the royal couple. They chatted happily about their travels. After the meal, they released colorful balloons decorating the dining room to entertain the welcoming crowds. When the Queen Mary sailed into Southampton, the crowds cheered wildly. Notably, two thousand children, representing youth organizations in Southampton, greeted the King and Queen with cheers. As the King and Queen disembarked, the children led the cheers. There was a slight drizzle in Southampton, but by the time they arrived at Waterloo Station at 5:20 PM, the sun was shining brightly and the weather was excellent. Both houses of Parliament announced a recess minutes before the arrival of the King and Queen in London, so that all members could see the King pass through Parliament Square. The area and the streets along the route were extremely crowded. Several postal workers carrying heavy packages were unable to move through the crowd and had to be helped by the police. The ceremony upon the arrival of the King and Queen at Waterloo was simple. The King spoke with Prime Minister Chamberlain, and together with the Queen and Queen Mary, walked past the lined-up cabinet members and foreign diplomats. Special attention was given to Ambassador Kennedy of the United States. The King and Queen then rode in an open carriage, its top removed by Pippen, through the streets, heading towards Buckingham Palace. The crowds along the route waved British and American flags, as well as banners with the words "Welcome Home," and cheered enthusiastically. The King and Queen smiled and waved in acknowledgment. As they passed the members of Parliament, the parliamentarians cheered, waving top hats and handkerchiefs. Westminster Abbey also rang its bells in welcome, and ships on the Thames River sounded their sirens. As the royal party passed the monument, the King raised his hand in salute, and the Queen and princesses bowed. After leaving the monument, the King and his party entered the final stretch of their journey to Buckingham Palace, with the crowds cheering thunderously. Approximately 50,000 people were waiting in front of Buckingham Palace to welcome the King and Queen, some of whom had been there since 8:30 AM, when the two princesses went to the Queen Mary. After the King and his party entered the palace, the crowd shouted, "We want to see our King!" The King and Queen and the two princesses appeared on the balcony at 6:15 PM to thank the welcoming crowd. However, the crowd did not leave. The King and Queen reappeared on the balcony at 8:30 PM for five minutes. Prime Minister Chamberlain entered the palace at 9:20 PM to meet with the King, but the crowd was unaware, as they were all looking up at the balcony, hoping to see the King and Queen again.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain proposed in the House of Commons to present an address to the King, expressing the Lower House's unwavering loyalty to the King upon his return from his trip to America. He stated, "The King and Queen were warmly welcomed by the masses wherever they traveled, which indicates the people's love and affection, beyond all expectations. Thanks to newspapers, radios, and newsreels, we, although remaining in the country, were able to learn the details of our King's travels. The King's travels not only demonstrate the great significance of the monarchy to the empire, but also demonstrate the genuine emotions transformed from the abstract concept of the monarchy. When the King and Queen arrived in the United States, they received a grand welcome from the American president and people, the enthusiasm of which was unprecedented. We are deeply moved by the warmth of the American government and people, which is due to the King and Queen's own impressive virtues, as well as the deep sympathy and friendship of the American people towards the empire." Labor MP Greenwood seconded the proposal, saying, "If President Roosevelt were to break precedent and visit England or a British dominion, he would receive the same enthusiastic welcome." This remark was met with great applause. Greenwood stated that the King and Queen's visit to America has opened a new chapter in Anglo-American relations, proving the depth of blood ties and demonstrating the friendship of people under the banner of freedom and democracy. The Prime Minister's motion was then passed amidst enthusiastic applause. The Upper House also passed a similar motion.</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Signed in Tokyo</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] France will sign a trade agreement with Japan in Tokyo on Friday, rebuilding a trade balance favorable to France. The agreement adjusts the situation caused by Japan's recent sharp reduction in French imports and the French implementation of a licensing system for Japanese imports on May 23rd.</p>
<h3>Duke of Windsor to Visit Spain</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Barcelona, 23rd] According to local newspapers, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor will visit Spain in approximately July.</p>
<h3>Christians Worldwide to Pray for China; Anti-Aggression League in England Demands Government Take Immediate Action to Stop Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The Archbishop of York and twenty bishops have jointly issued a circular letter, asking Christians of all countries to pray for China on July 9th. The original text of the letter was published in the newspapers today. The British General Assembly of the International Anti-Aggression League also passed a resolution, requesting the government to take diplomatic and economic action immediately, without waiting for the expressions of other countries, to stop the aggressive actions of violent Japan. When Britain implements sanctions against Japan, it should act jointly with members of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty signatories.</p>
<h3>Japan's Public Debt Continues to Increase</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Japanese government has issued a total of ¥6,300,500,000 (approximately £370,000,000) in war bonds. Within this fiscal year (ending March 31 next year), ¥4,505,860,000 (approximately £265,000,000) in bonds remain to be issued.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 23rd] According to an official announcement here on Thursday evening, a meeting of ministers will be convened on Saturday, chaired by French President Lebrun. It is reported that the meeting is specifically to discuss various foreign policy issues.</p>
<h3>New Anglo-French Proposals Unacceptable to Soviet Union; Discrepancies in Information; Talks May Be Delayed Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Regarding the proposed agreement to discuss the Anglo-Franco-Soviet treaty, representatives of the three countries held another round of negotiations at the Kremlin today for half an hour. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin, British Envoy Strang, and the ambassadors of Britain and France were all in attendance. It is reported that Molotov has informed the British and French representatives, stating that the new proposals are still unacceptable. Unofficial sources believe that the new Anglo-French proposals still fail to satisfy the Soviet Union's insistence on concrete guarantees for the Baltic states. However, in the current situation, it cannot be said that the negotiations have broken down. The results of the talks have been separately reported to London and Paris. Before new instructions arrive, the trilateral talks may be temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, the message released from Moscow, saying the latest advice Britain had obtained did not make any progress to the Anglo-Soviet talks is not entirely thought of in the London diplomatic circles; The British proposal, to the Soviet proposal, had already made major concessions in principle, even if the wording had not been specified, it is believed that the Soviet Union is persisting with its attitude, or there are other internal reasons, rather than merely issues with the style, only the correct form of explanation is too early in coming; Anglo-Soviet talks had never been expected to progress quickly, and now its future will be extended; At the same time, London had not received any formal confirmation that Molotov had rejected the British proposals, in the current situation, the report from the British Ambassador Seeds must be waited for, before Britain can make any further proposals.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd] According to the "Daily Express," British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds, and Strang, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, will soon be instructed by the government to resolve the points opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov: (1) avoiding mentioning the names of the Baltic states in the agreement; (2) regarding countries with special important relationships to one of the contracting parties, the contracting parties should consult each other before providing assistance under the agreement.</p>
<p>German Industrial Delegation Prepares to Go to Moscow</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Several key German industrialists are now sending a delegation to Moscow, with the aim of restoring German-Soviet trade relations. It is reliably learned that the delegation is tasked with presenting a ten-year credit loan of 750,000,000 marks to the Soviet Union, to be used by the Soviet Union to purchase German goods. At the same time, Germany is also prepared to purchase large quantities of raw materials from the Soviet Union, mainly wood, leather, and oil. Foreign political circles believe that the purpose of this move is to undermine Britain's policy towards Moscow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] Germany has proposed establishing a ten-year credit purchase agreement with the Soviet Union. Observers here believe that Germany intends to resist Britain's alliance plan.</p>
<h3>Greek King to Visit Italy</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 23rd] This morning's local newspapers reported that King George of Greece will visit Italy next week and attend the wedding of Duke Spoleto and Princess Irene of Greece. The King will arrive in Venice on his yacht "Hellas" on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Naval Conference in Singapore: Both Countries Attach Great Importance; Close Liaison Achieved Among Britain, America, and France</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] British and French Far East naval and military commanders will hold a meeting in Singapore on the 22nd. Naval circles here comment that this meeting was decided to be held long ago and was not convened due to the Tianjin Incident. However, its importance has been increased by the Tianjin situation. Since the Tianjin Incident has become a question of naval balance between the Far East navies and the Japanese navy, the combined fleet strength of Britain and France in the Far East is not sufficient to cope with the Japanese navy. It must rely on the United States to compete with it. Although the United States has no representatives attending the meeting, there is no doubt that the Singapore naval base will be available for use by the U.S. fleet in the event of war. Furthermore, although Japan is making every effort to avoid offending the United States, the recent incidents have proved that a local resolution of the Tianjin case is not what Japan wants. Currently, its intention is actually directed at all foreigners, which is inconsistent with the assurances provided by the Tokyo government. If this view is given time, the United States will also agree. A glimpse can be seen in Hull's recent remarks. The Japanese naval authorities' request for foreign ships to leave Shantou has been rejected by Yarnell, which shows that the United States has now taken decisive steps to accommodate the wishes of Britain and France. Once Britain, France, and the United States fully maintain their joint relationship, the current situation should change. What the Singapore conference is discussing is how this joint relationship should be technically developed.</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference Concludes Discussion of Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Geneva, 22nd - The International Labor Conference concluded its discussion of the report submitted by the Director-General of the Labor Bureau this morning. Director-General of the Labor Bureau, Weintraub, in his speech, quoted Chinese representative Li Pingheng as saying, "The diligence of the general public should be used to promote human happiness, not to manufacture armaments and war. We must never forget the suffering of China's 59 million workers due to the war. We should do our best to relieve them."</p>
<p>Short Comments</p>
<h3>"Friends of the Wounded"</h3>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, in order to reduce the suffering of wounded soldiers, recently allocated 20,000 yuan from the慰勞總會 to organize "Friends of the Wounded" groups to serve in various war zones. We believe this move is extremely important because passively alleviating the suffering of wounded soldiers contains the positive and great significance of boosting morale and close cooperation between the military and civilians.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is nearly two years old, and we have relied on the bloody battles of millions of soldiers on the front lines to overcome the dangers of national subjugation. We have relied on the generous sacrifices, broken legs, and arms of the soldiers on the front lines to see the light of future independent and free victory. We should expand assistance to the families of fallen soldiers, and we should respect and cherish the wounded soldiers even more. Moreover, the road ahead for the War of Resistance and national construction is still arduous!</p>
<p>Although we have been spared from the killing and plundering of × people's artillery fire, can we turn a blind eye to our motherland? We hope that all overseas Chinese communities will rise up and support Madame Chiang's move, organizing "Friends of the Wounded" groups in various places. At the same time, we hope that experienced and wealthy leaders in the overseas Chinese community will generously donate to build a cause!</p>
<h3>Important Statistics</h3>
<p>According to a military expert's research on the recent × Qing results, there are the following noteworthy results:</p>
<p>(1) × has mobilized 2 million troops to invade China;</p>
<p>(2) × has suffered more than 1 million casualties, including 300,000 deaths;</p>
<p>(3) Currently, there are 31 × divisions operating in China, distributed in North China, Central China, and South China (excluding puppet troops);</p>
<p>(4) ×'s war expenses for invading China:</p>
<p>1937: 254 million yen;</p>
<p>1938: 485 million yen;</p>
<p>1939: 527 million yen.</p>
<p>These statistics are mostly based on public figures from the military and political authorities of both countries. Although they cannot be said to be absolutely accurate, they are generally credible, as they do not exaggerate or underestimate excessively. From this, we can see the significant losses the × army has suffered, especially the increasing burden of military spending! At the same time, we can also see the threat that our soldiers in the north and south battlefields pose to the anti-Japanese ×. The more days our War of Resistance lasts, the more damage it inflicts on the Japanese ×! Furthermore, we can see how today's advocates of peace and compromise are helping the Japanese × save themselves from danger, helping the Japanese × replenish their strength to destroy all of China!</p>
<h3>Battle for the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang</p>
<p>"Outline of the Future European War</p>
<p>Recently, we have often heard about the status of the Baltic countries and the relationship with Germany's 'advance' policy. However, general discussions have focused on political actions, and there does not seem to be a thorough discussion of the strategic importance of these countries.</p>
<p>If a war breaks out in Europe one day—a war between aggressor and anti-aggressor countries—then the military position of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia will be absolutely important. It is very clear that if Germany advances into the Baltic Sea, the Soviet Union will not remain indifferent and will definitely implement the defense of the Baltic countries, because these countries are the Soviet Union's natural fortress in terms of terrain.</p>
<p>In a major war, the Soviet fleet will occupy a very important part. No one can know the strength of the Soviet navy; it is an absolute secret. However, there is no doubt that the Soviet fleet is strong enough and cannot be compared with its strength in the last World War. Excluding the Black Sea and Far East fleets, the Soviet Union's naval strength in the Gulf of Finland area is as follows: two 23,000-ton battleships, equipped with 10-inch guns; six well-equipped, modern cruisers; about 15 destroyers; more than 60 elite submarines; and 12 large motorboats. Such a navy, led by capable commanders, is very powerful. Even when dealing with the German fleet, it can achieve good results. Moreover, the German fleet must maintain considerable strength in the North Sea.</p>
<p>Berlin boasts that the North Sea coast is already guaranteed not to be invaded, because in the past two years, from Sylt in the north to Boulogne in the south, unbreakable fortresses have been built. However, modern knowledgeable naval strategists all agree that even with very strong defenses along the coast, it is impossible to completely avoid external attacks. Therefore, although Germany's western defenses are strong, they are also at risk of being attacked. Moreover, in order to maintain the continuation of the war, Germany must maintain trade with the Scandinavian countries, especially Sweden.</p>
<p>In the last World War, Germany was able to sustain itself for four years. The main factors were: (1) Germany constantly transported large quantities of magnets from Sweden to manufacture military equipment and ammunition; (2) Jewish professor Haber's new invention, which extracts ammonia from the air. If the Allied forces had been able to control Baltic Sea traffic at that time and cut off Germany's transportation with Sweden, the war could have ended earlier. The British submarine fleet once dominated the Baltic Sea, hindering Germany's transportation with Sweden and causing Germany great unease. However, due to the stagnation of the Russian fleet, which did not cooperate with the British submarines, Germany was fortunate enough to continue transporting magnets from Sweden and sustain the European War for as long as four years.</p>
<p>The current situation is fundamentally different. The agile Soviet fleet can be active in the Baltic Sea, which is a serious blow to Germany and Sweden's maritime traffic. The German naval authorities are also very clear about this, so its strategy is to strengthen the naval defenses of the Gulf of Finland to contain the Soviet fleet, especially to prevent the submarine fleet from having opportunities to operate. However, Germany cannot currently execute this great task because the bases around the Gulf of Finland are not in Germany's hands; moreover, Danzig and Memel are too far from the Gulf of Finland to be of any help. The only things Germany can utilize are Riga in Latvia, Tallinn in Estonia, and the Dago Islands in the Baltic Sea, all of which are important naval locations. If Germany can control them, it will be enough to deal with the Soviet fleet, and the Baltic Sea will become Hitler's world. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that Germany will still respect the neutrality of the Baltic countries once war breaks out.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has accurately determined that when a war occurs, Germany will inevitably seize the coastal areas of Latvia and Estonia. If the Soviet Union strictly adheres to its maritime defense policy, it can avoid attacks and maintain the strength of its fleet. Enemy air strikes must be strictly guarded against. In short, no one can know what policy the Soviet Baltic fleet will adopt except for the Moscow naval authorities. Recently, many senior Soviet naval officers have strongly advocated an "offensive" naval policy, so the Soviet fleet will definitely take active action when something happens.</p>
<p>The Baltic countries are, in terms of terrain, a natural fortress against Germany's advance into the Gulf of Finland. If Hitler can control this important bay, then in naval strategy terms, the Soviet fleet will be equivalent to nothing and useless; and all of the Soviet Union's sea routes, except for the White Sea, will be cut off.</p>
<p>The Baltic countries are the center of the current international political situation and will also be the decisive battlefield for the future German-Soviet War. (Excerpted and translated from the Hong Kong Telegraph, 22nd)</p>

<p>The Archbishop of York in England has launched a global prayer for China on July 9th by Christians worldwide. We express our deep gratitude and have nothing else to say. But we hope that while praying for China, we can also pray for the whole world, to reform the too barbaric races to a reasonable state, and to reform the too civilized races to stand up straight.</p>
<p>Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been going on for three months, turning and turning, but they have not yet converged. Each has their own reasons, and each thinks they are right. What should we say? What do the thousands of villages matter? Why offend people on either side?</p>
<p>Some charitable society has organized a Hong Kong and Kowloon ultra-Chinese martyred soldiers and civilians ten thousand people's fate meeting. It is scheduled for the 20th, lasting seven days, and is presided over by some Living Buddha. We do not quite understand this matter at all and do not know if it is another "Kalachakra Tantra Assembly" of the kind. This is: everyone can save the country, and each has different clever ways.</p>
<p>Today's "Small Anecdotes" on this page introduces the little history of ice cream. Ice cream is called "snow cream" in Hong Kong. One friend said that "snow cream" is the most beautiful translation name in Hong Kong; another friend protested, saying that the name is elegant, but not very communicative, ice cream is really made of ice, not snow. It is said that the distinction between ice and snow in Hong Kong is very vague, because Hong Kong has no snow at all. Whether this is indeed the case, we are still reserving our opinion. If any old Hong Konger among the readers knows and is happy to instruct us, it would be quite welcome.</p>

<p>Dr. Ma Junwu, who used to be the principal of China Public School and Guangxi University, was a hardworking and determined educator.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma was extremely frugal in his personal life. His clothing, shoes, food, and drink were all of the most basic kind. It was naturally even more impossible for him to give gifts or entertain guests.</p>
<p>It was in Guangzhou when, one day, Dr. Ma suddenly received an invitation: "Respectfully inviting you to a modest feast at the Grand Three Yuan Restaurant on the afternoon of a certain month at 6 o'clock." Signed below were two familiar friends.</p>
<p>Why are they hosting a feast? Dr. Ma was a little confused. However, it is impolite to decline an invitation. So, he decided to arrive on time.</p>
<p>That night, the Grand Three Yuan was very lively, with a constant stream of cars and people. Many virtuous people had gathered. There were many people, and the food was good, so Dr. Ma ate very well. After getting his fill of wine and food, Dr. Ma was preparing to find the host to express his gratitude and say goodbye. However, the two hosts who had invited him were nowhere to be found. All the other guests, however, surrounded him and said, "Thank you, Mr. Ma, for today's treat." One by one, they left.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma was truly perplexed. He quickly ran to the counter to take a look, and on the menu board, it was clearly written: "Number Five - Mr. Ma Junwu's Treat." Only then did he realize that he had been the victim of a prank.</p>
<h3>I Am a Prisoner of Hitler</h3>
<p>On the Line of Death</p>
<p>Mr. Julecius, the publisher of the German "Catholic Weekly," was invited to a concentration camp by Hitler because he often faithfully reported the atrocities of the Nazis to his readers. The following is a page from his diary in the camp:</p>
<p>May 16th. The diary reminds me that I came to this place on March 9th. It's been more than two months. I live on the third floor, in this small, dark room. Although it's not very comfortable, I don't care. The days seem to pass quietly, and the jailers are quite willing to talk to me.</p>
<p>But finally, it came; around one o'clock at night, two people came, saying they were secret detectives and wanted to take me for interrogation. The jailers didn't even have time to look at their orders, and I was taken away. They escorted me through the corridor to the administration office, took out bandages, and blindfolded me. Then, they pulled me east, west, up the stairs, down the stairs, many times, just to disorient me. Then, they led me to a room.</p>
<p>The blindfold was removed, and my eyes were dazzled by the bright lights. I vaguely saw that it was a rather spacious room. In front of me, many bright electric lights were shining on me. In the darkness behind the lights, many people were sitting, but because of the darkness, I couldn't see them clearly. In short, it was like a stage, I was the actor, under the lights, and they were the audience, all in the dark.</p>
<p>"Dr. Julecius!" A voice like a cow's bellow came from the darkness. At this time, I could vaguely see a few dark shadows moving.</p>
<p>"Who told you about the Brown House news?"</p>
<p>"I am responsible for any text published in my newspaper; no one else." I replied coldly.</p>
<p>"It seems you are unwilling to reveal your accomplices, is that right?" Another harsh voice said.</p>
<p>"I am unwilling." I simply retorted.</p>
<p>For a second, the room was dead silent. Then, I was pressed onto a table, and rubber batons rained down on me, striking twenty-five times.</p>
<p>I ignored it.</p>
<p>I was pressed onto a chair again and interrogated again.</p>
<p>I refused to open my mouth.</p>
<p>"You old dog, we will make you speak immediately."</p>
<p>Then, I was beaten again, about twenty-five times again. I almost fainted, and staggered back to the chair, breathing with difficulty.</p>
<p>"Are you willing to confess now?"</p>
<p>Why should I confess?</p>
<p>With a bang, a pistol was thrown on the table. Someone roared an order, "The gun is there, take it and commit suicide! You, you villain!"</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, "I won't commit suicide, I am a Catholic." I knelt down and prayed, I was only focused on praying to God, and let them do whatever they wanted to me!</p>
<p>Perhaps they were afraid of God's condemnation. They discussed among themselves for a long time and didn't dare to kill me.</p>
<p>The interrogation ended like this. I was still led out of the room by two secret detectives. Just as I reached the staircase, someone pushed me hard, and I fell down the stairs, lying on the floor. Just as I was about to touch the railing to get up, someone stomped down on my hand with heavy leather shoes.</p>
<p>I lay still, and there were feet wearing riding boots kicking me. Someone shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Are you willing to talk? You old dog!"</p>
<p>When I returned to this small, dark room, I was covered in blood. I prayed to God again. I thanked Him, because although I suffered a brutal attack, I was still alive. One day I will be able to continue my work.</p>
<h3>Short Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Ice Cream</p>
<p>The thermometer has jumped to over ninety degrees, and you're sweating like rain; you have to have ice cream again—Hong Kong calls it snow cream. But, do you know the anecdotes and history of ice cream? I'll tell you a little bit now.</p>
<p>The origin of ice cream cannot be traced back at all. It is only said that Queen Alexander loved to drink ice water and cold drinks, and specially sent subordinates to knock ice to return, and to pick fresh fruits to freeze them. The taste was good and cool to the heart. Thus, it became a sacred product. Perhaps this is some of the origin.</p>
<p>In the early seventeenth century, King Louis XIV of France wrote in his diary after attending a court banquet: "At the end of the banquet, each guest was presented with a silver cup containing an egg-like thing. Many people were curious about this new thing. After tasting it, they found it was a very delicious frozen cream."</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1660 that there were cafes in Paris selling frozen cream. England and other countries also competed to imitate it, but before this period, all frozen drinks had no sweetness; later, the method of making ice cream was compiled into a special book, which told people that they could add sugar and various fresh fruit juices, and thus there was progress.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ice cream making method was introduced to the Americas. An American chef named Philen carefully studied it and published his opinions in the newspaper. He devoted himself to the improvement of food and was very famous at the time, so this immediately became even more popular. In the United States, the name of Philen was very well-known. In fact, everything he did was learned from London. In 1789, George Washington held a historical banquet, and the ice cream used at the banquet was handled entirely by him.</p>
<p>Changing with each passing day, the ways of ice cream are naturally becoming more and more advanced. Now, the most advanced way is in the streets of America, you can drop a coin into a box, and immediately, you can get a cup of ice cream.</p>
<p>"When the judge questions you, you should smile like this first."</p>

<p>B: How could you support yourself when you were only nine months old?</p>
<p>A: I crawled to a baby competition and won the first prize. That was the starting point of my success.</p>
<p>Host: I have something to do at five o'clock tomorrow morning, remember, come and wake me up then.</p>
<p>Servant: I know, at that time you just need to press the bell, and I will come and wake you up.</p>
<h3>Sea Storm</h3>
<p>— Thirty Knights by Lawton translated by Yang Pi</p>
<p>Excerpt from the previous article: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was carrying eight million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Cox Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel in Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship began to run wildly aimlessly. Soon, the radio transmitted news that there were icebergs nearby. Fortunately, the icebergs soon slid past, but the passengers were frightened and became abnormal, causing a commotion. Jack had a conflict with a German professor...</p>
<p>"Make enemies! How could that be?" Jack said unconvinced, "That guy is just a fierce and cowardly coward. He—"</p>
<p>"Well, that's true, but he is a German professor—"</p>
<p>"Forget it! Do you also take these things to heart?"</p>
<p>"That's right, he is a professor at the German Military Academy. This Professor Rawicki is a very important figure in Germany." Balfour told him sincerely.</p>
<p>"Okay, Mr. Long Chicken, no matter what strange words he calls, or whether he is such a big figure as you said, he is always a coward. If he follows his lead and goes to the captain to find trouble for me, I won't be worried at all. First, my current position is just a volunteer officer, and second, I can bet you a pancake, or bet you that big apple you like, that old Mr. Long doesn't even have time to cover up what he did last night, how can he reveal it again?"</p>
<p>This Jack was wrong. In the future, he would know that Professor Rawicki would not let him off so easily.</p>
<p>Six. Warships are coming</p>
<p>This afternoon, Jack heard some passengers who couldn't stand the stimulation shouting in horror again. He quickly ran to the middle deck and saw a thick cloud of smoke in the northern sky. Moreover, he could see that it was a ship. In the telescope, he could already see that it was a warship? But, it was not possible to identify which country it belonged to for a while.</p>
<p>Jack quickly ran into the radio room. Balfour said that he had not received any telegrams, nor had he heard any news related to this strange ship. On the beams, the crew members were discussing in surprise. This warship was moving closer every minute. It was a black, wide, and short ship with two very thick smokestacks, from which very thick and a lot of black smoke was billowing. In front of her bow, large piles of white foam splashed up, showing that she was rushing forward rapidly.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, Balfour shouted, "Ah, here it comes!" He quickly wrote it down and handed it to Jack. Jack saw that it was written on it:</p>
<p>By order of the Emperor, stop proceeding immediately.</p>
<p>HMS Berwick</p>
<p>"I'll send it up immediately," Jack shouted, "Hayes, listen hard, see if there is any more news."</p>
<p>"I don't think I'll miss it, Jack, do you think they will fire at us?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I guess they will if we don't stop." Jack said, and quickly ran away.</p>
<p>After the captain read the note, he said, "That's exactly what I thought."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to tell Hayes to reply that we have stopped?" Jack asked.</p>
<p>"Stop! I cannot obey the British warships to stop." The captain said irritably.</p>
<p>He immediately picked up the phone, ordered the engine room to increase the heat as much as possible, and make the ship 'accelerate forward'. Thus, the ship shot forward like an arrow, with piles of black smoke rolling out of the chimneys, and coal ash falling like rain on the deck.</p>
<p>Economic Column</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade: Barter Trade Effective; Tea Exports to the Soviet Union and Tung Oil Exports to the United States; Barter is the Main Export; New Transportation Lines Can be Utilized</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of barter trade for foreign trade, it has been quite effective. As a result, China's tea exports to the Soviet Union have increased sharply, and are concentrated in Hong Kong for export. For example, from January to April, tea exports from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union amounted to 19,903,258 pounds, with a total value of several hundred and twenty-two million seven hundred and seventy-four thousand Hong Kong dollars, accounting for more than 80% of the export value. In addition, the export volume of raw silk, tung oil, pig bristles, sheepskin, and fur has not decreased sharply due to the war. It is heard that the barter trade method will be gradually promoted. The current practice is to barter tea for goods from the Soviet Union and tung oil for goods from the United States.</p>
<p>Appropriate Millions to Promote Production</p>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan issued an order to all provinces to promote production and instructed the competent authorities to raise funds, it was decided that the competent authorities would allocate 10 million yuan to develop inland production enterprises. Guangxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces were designated to improve seeds, promote sideline occupations, prevent and control pests, pay attention to water conservancy, and reclaim wasteland for agriculture. For industry, they were to improve technology, promote domestic products, reward small industries and handicrafts, develop mining enterprises, and invigorate rural finance, improve the organization of various industries, etc.</p>
<p>Centralized Export to Obtain Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the Trade Commission implemented the management of exports, it has assisted in exporting no less than tens of millions of yuan. Centralized exports of foreign exchange have amounted to nearly tens of millions of yuan. For example, the tea, oil, and silk stored in Hankou, as well as the silk and tea from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, were transported to Hong Kong to obtain foreign exchange only after the Commission's dredging and rush transport. Other assistance in transporting and purchasing materials from various provinces has also been quite successful. Recently, it has also increased the handling of barter trade with a certain country, and its business has therefore developed further. It is expected that the value of managed exports this year will increase more than in the previous two years.</p>
<p>Open New Routes to Promote Trade</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of our troops from Shanghai, foreign trade has been concentrated in Guangdong and Hubei. Since the withdrawal from Guangdong and Hubei, the ability to export foreign goods through Haiphong has been due to the central government's encouragement and assistance. Afterwards, the sharp increase in the trade volume of various inland ports, and the continued increase in the export value of certain commodities, would have been difficult to achieve without the Trade Commission's mediation. Recently, the central government has expedited the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway and established a certain company, which will further promote trade, enabling major local products to be exported continuously through the new transportation lines. This is truly a good phenomenon in the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<h3>HSBC Continues to Supply Foreign Exchange, Rumors Subside and People are at Ease, Black Market Foreign Exchange Remains Stable as Ever, Cash Prices Fall Back from Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] Since the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee adjusted the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, the British-owned HSBC Bank has continued to provide as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries. As a result, the black market exchange rate has tended to stabilize, with the British pound at six and a half pence and the US dollar at 12.625 yuan, seemingly reaching the so-called new horizontal line. Last Saturday, the financial market spread rumors that HSBC had stopped selling black market foreign exchange, causing rumors to rise and cash to skyrocket, reaching a peak. The day before yesterday (18th) was Sunday, and the banks were closed. After the market opened yesterday on Monday, the facts proved that HSBC Bank had not stopped selling, so people were at ease, the rumors subsided, and cash prices had also fallen back. HSBC has not changed its temper.</p>

<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Shi Qi</p>
<p>Hearing the news of the fall of my hometown was already after midnight.</p>
<p>I grabbed an old, bald pen and scribbled on the paper, trying to press it on the paper to leave some traces.</p>
<p>The light of the weak kerosene lamp diffused, constantly shaking, rising above the lamp, shaking, making a slight hissing sound. The pen tip only pressed some circles, straight lines, stone-like unconscious things on the paper. Only these things were abandoned by the melancholy inertia in my heart.</p>
<p>Outside the window was a black expanse, hiding secrets and ominousness. There were no stars, no moon, no clouds, no fog in the sky. It looked like a black, stern, and cold face. The contours of the spires of the buildings were inserted into the black mist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sound of a gust of wind rolled in, the continuous sound of droplets hitting and hitting, in my mood filled with melancholy and old thoughts, it was just a collection of cries of misery and anger. The rain continued, and outside the window was still a black, vast expanse. A faint glow from the window lattices of distant buildings reflected the crystal clear raindrops, and my eyes also dripped crystal clear blood tears.</p>
<p>Like the black clouds before the sudden rain, all the memories squeezed tightly into the entire heart, as if it was too full and about to vomit.</p>
<p>On the calm river water of the Han River, by the riverbank, my father looked at the stagnant river water and said to me: "Will life be as calm as the river water?" He issued such a sigh, and an ugly smile appeared on his face. He just parted like that, in the miserable cries of the whistle.</p>
<p>Then, when the river water was dyed blood red, people drifted in all directions! Ah, until now, it has been two whole years. In these two years of exile, I have always been unable to figure out the sigh that my father said, "Will life be as calm as the river water!" Is it true? Perhaps it is, after enduring this period of refugee time, life will be as calm as the river water, right?</p>
<p>The sound of the rain gradually lowered, and only the sound of one or two drops falling and touching the ground broke the silence of the late night. The flame of the kerosene lamp also jumped higher and higher indefinitely. I knew: it was about to go out. The bald pen was still scribbling on the paper, still those circles, straight lines, stone-like things.</p>
<p>The light suddenly went out, and suddenly it seemed that the people I remembered had turned into a fire of resistance, breaking through the life as calm as the river water and going towards the boundless sky.</p>
<h3>I Acknowledged It Silently</h3>
<p>— Qing Mu</p>
<p>At dusk, a faint crescent moon hung on the pale sky. I like to sit at a square table by the wooden window at this time. I look at the green mountains, the ancient and bent-backed pine trees. One evening, a shepherd boy led his cattle past the wooden window. He saw me.</p>
<p>——Are you sick?</p>
<p>——No.</p>
<p>——Why don't you come out and take a walk in the mountains?</p>
<p>——After you lead the cattle back, come to my place to play!</p>
<p>——Okay, but you have to wait a long time.</p>
<p>He pulled up his calico clothes and wiped the sweat off his face. That oily forehead was so dark from the sun. He stared at me with a pair of round, bright, black eyes. He seemed to want to tell me a secret.</p>
<p>His thin lips were moving, but he didn't say anything. His uneven, grassy hair and two soft ears that fell forward seemed to be expecting something.</p>
<p>——What is it?</p>
<p>——I saw a pair of colored ones again. Do you say that bullets can still come out of the calf after they have entered?</p>
<p>——Of course…</p>
<p>——Then can't we pick them up… and shoot them into the heads of the Japanese devils!</p>
<p>He didn't understand my smile, the strange smile.</p>
<p>——Go back. Let's talk about these things later, okay?</p>
<p>He pulled up the corner of his clothes again, wiping his sweat:</p>
<p>——…Okay…</p>
<p>He walked away. Then came the night. Night—that still night with a heavy terror: every tree branch turned into a demonic hand that could strangle people's throats. I watched the sky gradually darken, and finally felt tired and lay down on the wooden bed. I felt a little weak, but as long as the heart was still beating, no matter what, I had to work.</p>
<p>I was a little cold, so I had to support myself from the wooden bed, groped for a match in the dark, and lit the oil lamp. I looked at so many "Personnel and Weapons Statistical Reports" on the table that I still had to process. I was excited, I realized that just now it was a dream—a very bad nightmare!</p>
<p>"That is a shame!"</p>
<p>I acknowledged it silently, I acknowledged it silently. The flame of the oil lamp was jumping. I recorded that moment just now… every detail was written down. It's a mirror, right? Or it will become a mirror.</p>

<h3>Bacterial and Anesthetic Warfare (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by JMurray, Translated by Tianren</p>
<p>Recently, a Belgian scientist announced that bacteria will be used as deadly weapons in the next war, which has sent chills down the spines of billions and sparked heated discussions among countless experts.</p>
<p>French newspapers have reported that German chemical laboratories are working day and night to cultivate billions of bacteria with various toxicities to decimate the × nation's people. Many French chemical experts have even solemnly classified these deadly bacteria and specified the diseases that each bacterium can cause. Some British scientists, while not believing these rumors, solemnly nodded in agreement regarding the question of whether bacteria would be used in the next major war! It is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>When the secrets of these deadly weapons that will appear in the next war are yet to be revealed, people tremble at the mere mention of them. Everyone is reluctant to discuss this bacterial warfare that could wipe out billions of human beings. However, many European newspapers now deeply regret the mistake of having neglected this issue in the past. Because after starting to discuss this issue (although feeling slightly late), they have reached a credible conclusion, believing that the damage that bacteria can inflict as weapons is extremely limited.</p>
<p>(1) The application of bacteria is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Experts in both Britain and France firmly believe that the implementation of bacterial warfare is even more restricted than the use of other weapons. The scientists of various countries know about all the bacteria that have been discovered. Their habits and characteristics have been deeply studied and classified and recorded. Poison gas can be manufactured in laboratories, but bacteria—even if new species that can devastate humankind can be cultivated—are difficult to cultivate in large quantities. Even if a country's military attempts to use known bacteria for warfare, there are still many difficulties.</p>
<p>There are two ways to spread diseases:</p>
<p>The first method is to transmit diseases through direct contact between individuals. Therefore, if the aim is to spread the disease widely in × country to force it to submit, countless own country's troops must first be sacrificed, allowing them to become infected with the disease and then secretly dispatching them to × country. Using this method to attack × people is obviously too great a sacrifice. Because even if this method manages to fulfill its mission, × people can isolate the patients and try to eliminate this epidemic.</p>
<p>The second method is to inject diseases into × country using fleas, rats, etc. as vectors. Using this method, the military must carry millions of fleas and rats. And they must be infected with pneumonic plague or bubonic plague.</p>
<p>(2) Rodents cannot complete the mission</p>
<p>When I raised the question of whether fleas and rats could be used to spread diseases to × country to a Swiss chemist, he said it was impossible. Because fleas and rats have no national consciousness. Those who experienced World War I can prove that they cannot distinguish between × allies and enemies. Therefore, fleas and rats will spread diseases indiscriminately across borders, causing infectious diseases to prevail on both sides of the front line.</p>
<p>A British microscopic scholar, John Fawcett, said that the above two methods could exterminate × people, unless the following occurs.</p>
<p>He said: Once the bacteria of each disease is known, it can be resisted with a serum. This serum is made from the blood of animals infected with the disease and has the effect of preventing epidemics. Therefore, when various known infectious diseases occur, or even before they occur, blood can be quickly and massively shed to reduce the harm of the disease.</p>
<p>"Only some unknown types of bacteria can truly exterminate human races. If a country's bacterial research department can secretly cultivate an unnamed epidemic bacterium and can produce a serum to inject into its own people, then that country can truly use this uncontrollable epidemic to destroy × people. However, this possibility still seems very remote.</p>
<p>(3) Warfare using anesthetics as weapons.</p>
<p>Those experts who discuss the weapons used in the next war firmly believe that anesthetics will prevail. A British writer, John Carpenter, who specializes in the study of weapons of war, once said in an article that anesthetics can be used on a large scale as weapons of war, and they are easy to use. He described the use of anesthetics as follows:</p>
<p>"When the war breaks out, millions of soldiers gather on the front line. Suddenly, × side artillery fires, bombarding them fiercely. The shells falling in their midst are a bit different, they all explode into shattered dust. Waves of "shell dust" fall on the soldiers, and immediately thousands upon thousands fall to the ground, losing consciousness. In an instant, millions of troops are anesthetized and fall to the ground. Then the artillery stops firing, followed by large numbers of × people surging in like a tide. Millions of unconscious people are disarmed. And they are surrounded by × people, with many machine guns placed in important strongholds. Soon, they gradually wake up. When they regain consciousness, loudspeakers placed all around tell them that if they do not surrender, they will be annihilated. Naturally, they feel that sacrifice is useless and surrender unconditionally. The war ends in this way.</p>
<p>(4) George Bernard Shaw would rather have anesthetic or gas warfare</p>
<p>The great British writer George Bernard Shaw, in his recent comments on weapons of war, declared that he would rather be anesthetized and lose consciousness, or even be suffocated by poison gas, than be blown to pieces by a sixteen-inch caliber cannon.</p>
<h3>From Chengdu to Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>8.  Reminiscences on the Hanbao Road</p>
<p>"Strength to uproot mountains, spirit overshadowing the world,</p>
<p>The time is unfavorable, and my horse will not run;</p>
<p>If my horse will not run, what is to be done?</p>
<p>Yu, oh Yu, what is to be done?"</p>
<p>And committed suicide by drawing his sword. Heroes often have short-sightedness, and arrogant soldiers are bound to fail. Those who are tyrannical and domineering are bound to fail. It is not only Xiang Yu who is like this, even Napoleon, the unparalleled hero who dominated Europe, eventually had to retreat from Moscow in defeat and could never rise again. We have seen the brutal and domineering aggressive atrocities of the Japanese warlords, and in the near future, they will inevitably suffer the same consequences as Xiang Yu and Napoleon.</p>
<p>Passing through the plank road and Liuba, we reach Miaotaizi. The place is extremely quiet and the scenery is beautiful. There is the "Han Zhang Liuhou Temple," also known as Zhang Liang Temple. Liu Bang gained the world with the help of Han Xin, Zhang Liang, and Xiao He, calling his dynasty Han, and establishing himself as Emperor Gaozu of Han. Afterwards, he became suspicious of Han, Zhang, and Xiao. Eventually, he put Han Xin, the founding hero, to death. Xiao He was imprisoned. The extremely intelligent Zhang Liang saw all this clearly and understood his future fate (if he did not leave). So he resolutely hid his talents and, according to legend, came to this tranquil place to live as a recluse. After losing these three heroes, Emperor Gaozu Liu Bang's accomplishments began to decline. This shows the importance of talent to the country and the nation; it shows that a leader without the capacity to tolerate others cannot achieve anything in politics. This is a universal truth throughout history and across the world.</p>
<p>Leaving Chaiguan Ridge and entering Shuangshipu, a small town that forks into two roads: one to Baoji, and the other to Tianshui in Gansu Province, passing through Xinjiang, and connecting to the Northwest National Highway of the Soviet Union, which passes through here. From this, we can understand that the recent activities of the devils in central Hubei, attempting to control the Han River, attack Xiangyang, and threaten Hanzhong, are not without reason.</p>
<p>Passing through Bianshipu, we gradually enter the Qinling Mountains. The cliffs are towering and majestic, and the snow in the stone walls and valleys is several feet deep. It is said that airplanes passing through here often cause people's mouths and noses to bleed due to the high air pressure, and inexperienced pilots dare not fly over these mountains lightly. The car spent two hours climbing to the top of the ridge; descending the mountain, we made twenty-seven turns before reaching the foot of the mountain. Leaving the mountainous area, we entered the Ban-Yuan (half-plain) of the Wei River, and Baoji, our destination, shone in the distance with ten thousand lights.</p>
<p>Baoji is also a small city, but because it is located at the western end of the Longhai Railway, connecting to Xi'an in the east and then to Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces, and entering Hanzhong in the south and then to Chengdu and Chongqing. If the War of Resistance enters the second stage and all the railway lines are lost, this place will be a hub for the highway lines connecting western and northern China, with constant traffic. It is precisely for this reason that Baoji has become increasingly prosperous since the War of Resistance; more and more roads have been built, and there are one or two two- or three-story Western-style buildings; electric lights have been installed, and the smell of kerosene is gone from the sidewalks; the War of Resistance has put Baoji on the road to a capitalist city, although it is still only beginning.</p>
<p>At 9 p.m., I boarded the only remaining train in the motherland—the Longhai train—heading towards Chang'an, the capital of every dynasty, and the birthplace of national revival.</p>

<h3>Local Naval Authorities Notify British Ships to Sail to Shantou as Usual. Ignore Unreasonable Demands. Firmly Deny the Right of × to Blockade Shantou. Britain and the United States Warn × Army to Ensure the Safety of Foreign Nationals. First Batch of Refugees from Shantou Arrives in Hong Kong on Norwegian Merchant Ship Yesterday</h3>
<p>After × people began to invade Shantou, they attempted to block the seaport under pretexts to exclude the interests of third countries. The × chief Kinteng has invaded Shantou. On the day of the invasion, he resorted to intimidation and made unreasonable demands on Britain and the United States to withdraw their warships. The momentum was fierce, and the situation was serious. British and American authorities have insight into the conspiracy of the × side and decided to ignore its illegal demands. The local naval authorities have notified British ships to sail to Shantou as usual. A US warship also arrived in Shantou from Gulangyu yesterday to cope with any unexpected events. Both Britain and the United States have warned × party to be responsible for protecting the safety of foreign nationals. It can be seen that the attempt of × party to blockade has been thwarted.</p>
<p>Local Naval Authorities Notify British Ships to Sail to Shantou</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign news reported that after the Japanese army invading Shantou notified foreign ships to leave Shantou, the local naval authorities yesterday notified various British shipping companies, ordering them to send ships to Shantou as usual, regardless of the Japanese warning, because Britain absolutely cannot recognize the Japanese right to blockade Shantou. After receiving the notice, Jardine Matheson, Swire, Jardine and other companies have made such preparations. Jardine Matheson's Fuso Wheel first set off for Shantou at 1 pm yesterday. Swire Shipping's Jiangsu Wheel is also scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Shantou on Sunday this week. In Shanghai, Jardine Matheson's Desheng and Zesheng also opened Shantou yesterday. After arriving in Shantou, the wheels will first moor outside the mouth of the Han River. Wait for the order of the British warship captain stationed in Shantou, and then drive into the port. At that time, the British warship will **** drive into Shantou Port. Jardine Matheson's Haicheng Wheel also left Hong Kong yesterday afternoon, but because there were no passengers and goods to Shantou, it will not stay when passing through Shantou and go straight to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Warn × to Ensure the Safety of Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>As for the foreign ships registered in Shantou, there were originally three British ships "Shan Ni Tu", "Scott" and the US ship "Bit Siba Cai". Although the Japanese side threatened to order them to leave Shantou on the 20th, all foreign ships decided to ignore them. Yesterday, the Japanese side's letter of mourning and atonement expired, and the result was beyond the Japanese side's expectations. Each ship is still stationed at the mouth of the Han River, and there is no change. The commander of the US Fleet in China, Shi Ge Luo Chen, drove the ship "Zun Di Bu Bi" from Hong Kong to Gulangyu on Tuesday of this week. Because the war in Shantou broke out, he returned to Shantou from Gulangyu yesterday. When entering Shantou Port, he passed through the Japanese fleet's line, and assisted the British ship "Scott" to monitor the mouth of the Han River. Both Britain and the United States have severely warned × chief Kinteng to be responsible for protecting the lives and properties of foreign nationals. There are more than two hundred British overseas Chinese in Shantou City, fifty-eight American overseas Chinese, and sixty people of other nationalities.</p>
<p>Norwegian Merchant Ship Carries More Than 100 Refugees to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Norwegian merchant ship Borin Merlin arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou at 7 am yesterday. This is the first foreign merchant ship to depart from the Shantou war zone after the Shantou war. The ship left Shanghai fully loaded with passengers and goods on the 18th of this month and went to Shantou. The Shantou war broke out on the 21st, and was trapped in the port. It was not until the 22nd that it was ordered to pick up foreign women and children from Shantou to Hong Kong. It set off from Shantou at 11 am on the 22nd and arrived in Hong Kong at 7:30 am yesterday. First, it entered the sea ban for quarantine, and then sailed to the sea off Sai Wan, where Chinese and foreign passengers took barges to land. In addition to carrying more than 150 Chinese and foreign passengers, there was also a large shipment of goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Shantou. The goods shipped to Shantou included flour, dried bean curd, bean cake, salted fish, matches, onions, gypsum, soap, medicinal materials, light bulbs, etc. After the goods were shipped to Shantou, they were waiting to be unloaded, but the war broke out suddenly and they had to be stored on the ship and shipped to Hong Kong. As for the goods shipped to Hong Kong from Shanghai, there are foreign fire, foreign fire paper, medicinal materials, onions, brassware, wood, yarn, canvas, lead powder, flashlights, foreign cloth, hawthorn, groceries, etc., a total of 2,820 pieces. After arriving in Hong Kong yesterday morning, all of the above goods were unloaded in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Seven Foreign Nationals Arrive in Hong Kong, Others Still Remain in Shantou</p>
<p>The reporter of the Minzhong Society boarded the ship for an interview. According to a statement issued by a senior Western staff member of the ship, when the Shantou war broke out, the ship was moored in the sea off the Shantou Port Customs, and there was also a Taikoo company Yinzhou Wheel moored at the pier in front of the Customs. At 4 am on the morning of the 11th, the Japanese aircraft first bombed Shantou City. At 8 am on the morning, five Japanese warships entered the port and began to attack Shantou City. The war then began at this time. In the afternoon of the same day, two Japanese officers drove a speedboat to the ship, and carried official documents, the contents of which sought the ship to leave Shantou before the 22nd. The ship was ordered to leave Shantou and set off for Hong Kong in the afternoon of the same day, and then set sail at 11 am on the 22nd. In addition to the goods, there were more than 150 passengers, most of whom were refugees from the war zone. Among them were seven foreign men and women (yesterday mistakenly thought to be seventy people), the British Embassy in China Commercial Secretary Ke Zhichen, American woman Mrs. Hoba and her two sons and one daughter, and Miss Tang Hua and Miss Bai Landi, etc. They were family members of American missionaries traveling in Shantou. In addition, there were five German Jewish men, women and children. There were 150 Chinese passengers, and other foreign nationals remained in Shantou.</p>
<p>Thirty Customs Officers of Chao Mei Customs Retreat to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Thirty customs officers from Chao Mei Customs also left Shantou for Hong Kong on the ship yesterday. According to the customs officers who came to Hong Kong, the first to occupy the customs was the devil at 5 am on the 22nd, as the devil's headquarters. The tax division is still stationed in the customs and has not left Shantou. In addition, there are five Jewish men and women among the foreign passengers, two of whom work as auto mechanics in our country. They have been serving in China for many years and have worked in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou and other places. Recently, they went to Shantou from Shanghai. They originally planned to transfer to Chongqing from Shantou, but the war broke out immediately after arriving in Shantou. They then took the ship to Hong Kong. Due to nationality issues, they failed to land yesterday and stayed on the ship. It is said that they have been trying to transfer to Chongqing from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers and Overseas Chinese Hold National Oath Tomorrow. 60 to 70 Labor Groups Participate. Overseas Fujianese in Hong Kong Also Hold Oath on the Same Day</h3>
<p>After our most beloved leader launched the National Covenant Spirit General Mobilization, compatriots at home and abroad have taken oaths one after another. There have been many cases of overseas Chinese groups and overseas Chinese schools in Hong Kong holding oaths. Hong Kong and Kowloon labor groups have also scheduled a joint National Covenant and Spirit General Mobilization oath at 9 am tomorrow at Yau Ma Tei Pu Qing Theatre. It is learned that there are as many as 60 to 70 labor groups participating in the joint Yi Cao this time. In addition to holding the oath at that time, they will also send a letter in the name of the Hong Kong labor community to express their condolences to the soldiers on the front line for their bloody and iron spirit in resisting the devils. Overseas Fujianese in Hong Kong will also hold a National Covenant oath tomorrow. It is scheduled to be held at the Confucian Church on Caroline Hill at 2 pm. Xu Shiying and Wu Tiecheng will be invited to supervise the oath and give a speech.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday. Appeal to Chaozhou Overseas Chinese in Nanyang to Relieve Their Homeland</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association for Disaster Refugees held a meeting at the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce at 8 pm yesterday. Those present were Chairman Lin Zifeng, Lin Zishi, Chen Rongzhai, Li Zhizhang, Lin Yide, Chen Zizhao, Xu Youmei, Ma Zemin, Huang Lansheng, Hong Heyou, Chen Junfu, Xi Ziting, Chen Eshi, etc. Dozens of people. After the meeting, the record Li Lianfa first announced that the previous cases were correct, and the chairman Lin Zifeng signed and sealed them as true. Then he stood up and announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that he invited representatives of various groups to the meeting this evening because the iron hooves of the devils have stepped on the homeland, and all Chaozhou overseas Chinese should urgently rise up to jointly seek the responsibility of relief. At the same time, for fear that the local relief force is weak, I intend to send a telegram to the overseas Nanyang ports to appeal, requesting overseas Chinese to carry out the movement to relieve their hometown. Tracing back to the past, Hong Kong Port, because it is adjacent to the motherland, is often the overseas Chaozhou overseas Chinese's transit voice machine. Now that the hometown is in danger, it is reasonable to inform the public, so as to jointly seek ways to provide relief facilities, and also ask everyone present to express their opinions, so as to collect ideas and broaden the benefits. Then Lin Zishi stood up and suggested: (1) First seek to select a location to accommodate refugees, so that refugees can be resettled at that time, (2) Expand the scope of work of the association, and collect all Hong Kong Chaozhou overseas Chinese from all walks of life such as business, industry, academia, and specialized technicians, and register them all to jointly handle the hometown relief work, (3) Set up a temporary council under the fundraising association to be solely responsible for this relief work in Chaoshan. Finally, he also proposed to collect Chaozhou sailing ships in Hong Kong for transportation when necessary, such as providing Chaoshan with food and transporting refugees, etc. Secondly, if there are Chaozhou refugees coming to Hong Kong, they will be entertained and comforted. Following Lin Zishi, Lin Yide, Chen Yongxu, Ma Zemin, Xu Youmei and others provided opinions. After discussion, it was resolved that (1) the news and its process of the fall of Shantou this time should be sent to all Chaozhou overseas Chinese in Nanyang, and they should be urgently requested to raise funds for relief and the authorities should be requested to provide relief quickly, (2) Lin Zifeng, Lin Zishi, Ma Zemin, Xu Youmei, Chen Yongzhai, Chen Zizhao, Hong Heyou and other seven people were elected to plan and investigate fundraising matters, and Lin Zishi was responsible for drafting all the details.</p>
<h3>Riding a Bicycle Without Holding the Handlebars. A Fine of Three Dollars as a Warning.</h3>
<p>Young Xiao Yi (22 years old) was arrested on the 22nd for riding a bicycle on Gloucester Road in Wan Chai without holding the handlebars and showing off his skills. Si Pan sentenced him to a fine of three dollars as a warning yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>National Currency Stabilizes and Rises. Prices Soar.</h3>
<p>The previous day, various Chinese-funded banks in Shanghai were ordered to restrict withdrawals. When the news first came out, it was mixed and uneven, and the national currency market also swayed. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the measures taken by Shanghai Bank were beneficial to the national currency, and people's hearts were greatly settled. The national currency stabilized and began to rise again. At the close of the market yesterday afternoon, the national currency rose to 4.4, and the Guangdong currency rose to 3.65, which is far from the lowest record of 3.95 (national currency). At the time of the rise and fall of our national currency, the Japanese yen has been consistently depressed. Yesterday, each Japanese yen was only worth 97 cents, and a large amount of foreign exchange had been dumped to maintain it. As for counterfeit money and the devil's military tickets, they are only worth 83 cents.</p>
<h3>After Hong Kong and Macao Reciprocate Quarantine, Travelers Feel Greatly Inconvenienced. The Number of People Going to Macao Has Decreased Sharply, Affecting Various Industries in the Market. Some People in Macao Sell Certificates for Profit.</h3>
<p>Since Hong Kong and Macao have reciprocally designated each other as epidemic transmission ports, passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Macao must hold a vaccination certificate before being allowed to land. This measure is to take care of the health of residents in both places and prevent the spread of the epidemic. However, due to the troublesome procedures, passengers feel greatly inconvenienced, and the number of people traveling between the two places has decreased greatly. According to passengers who took the Xi'an Wheel to Macao yesterday, passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Macao must hold a vaccination certificate issued by a Portuguese doctor or a Hong Kong government doctor before it can take effect. However, more than thousands of people go to Macao every day, so there are hundreds of people waiting in line at various Portuguese doctors and government doctors all day long to get vaccinations and issue certificates. Some people wait all day and still do not get their turn, and the procedures are extremely troublesome. The same situation has occurred in Macao, and cunning people have taken the opportunity to make profits. One person is vaccinated multiple times and obtains multiple certificates, and then sells them to passengers who want to take the ship to Hong Kong. The selling price is about one or two yuan per certificate. Most passengers, for the sake of convenience, also buy them from these people. The Macao government has now discovered this matter and is paying attention to prevent it. Anyone who brings an old certificate to the anti-epidemic office to apply for a new one must check whether their age and name match the information filled in at the office before allowing the replacement. After this method was implemented, the number of people secretly selling certificates has decreased. However, because the certificate for going to Macao from Hong Kong has a photo of the person affixed to it, it cannot be transferred to others, so there have been no cases of reselling certificates so far.</p>
<p>According to a visitor from Macao, since Macao implemented import quarantine, residents of Hong Kong, because of the troublesome procedures, do not take a step forward without important tasks. The number of passengers going to Macao from Hong Kong every day has decreased by 30% to 40% compared to before the implementation of import quarantine. Various shopping malls in Macao have been affected by this, and business has become sluggish. The biggest impact is on hotels, casinos, entertainment venues, and food stores.</p>
<h3>"Good Methods for Raising Children" Welcome All Circles to Obtain.</h3>

<p>Sixty Pounds of Rotten Pork. A Fine of One Hundred Dollars.</p>
<p>Coolie Ma Ping, 28 years old, was accused yesterday morning by the Kowloon Magistrate's Office in Qian Si Tang of carrying 60 pounds of rotten pork on the previous day, violating health regulations. The official sentenced him to a fine of one hundred yuan, or two months in prison in lieu.</p>
<h3>Affected by the Shantou War, Grain Market Prices Have Soared Daily; Hong Kong Government Pays Attention to Regulation; Original Prices Should Be Restored Soon</h3>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, the residents of Hong Kong relied heavily on Shantou for their food supply, especially vegetables. With the outbreak of war in Shantou, cargo transportation was also cut off. As a result, grain prices in Hong Kong have been affected for the past three days. The market price of various grains has even doubled. Pork, however, has not seen a major change in the market situation due to the ample supply from Guangzhou and Beihai. Similarly, eggs and other items have been continuously supplied from Wenzhou and Guangzhou Bay. The Hong Kong government is paying extraordinary attention to the food supply for residents. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has been closely monitoring changes in the sources of various grains. The authorities are also deeply concerned about the impact of the Shantou war on grain prices and are currently considering methods of regulation. According to observations by vegetable merchants, the recent increase in vegetable prices is due to the stimulation of the Shantou war, which is unavoidable. Judging from the current situation, the source of vegetables from Guangzhou Bay is expected to increase in the future, and vegetable prices are expected to return to normal soon.</p>

The expenses will be covered by donations from the students, with the school subsidizing any shortfall. Li Xianzhang, Ke Yaoyang, Chen Xingxiu, Huang Lijuan, and thirty others have been designated as civil school service personnel responsible for handling the matter, it is said.</p>
<h3>Another Impact of the Shantou War: War Risk Insurance Premiums Increase, Effective Next Month</h3>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war in South China, all goods entering and leaving China used Hong Kong as a hub. Hong Kong exporters are accustomed to insuring their goods with insurance companies based on the value of the goods. In the past, insurance types were limited to water damage and general safety. Since the outbreak of the war, war risk insurance has also been required. War risk insurance premiums are the highest. Previously, the war risk insurance premium was six dollars and twenty-five cents per thousand dollars of goods. Recently, due to the Shantou war, certain insurance companies have jointly discussed raising war risk insurance premiums. If they reach a unanimous agreement, it will be implemented next month, it is said. Furthermore, as × people repeatedly bomb undefended cities in China, goods arriving in China and entering warehouses, or being unloaded from ships, are often attacked. Foreign insurance companies are not responsible for this type of loss. Only a small number of insurance organizations with Chinese capital are willing to take on the greatest risks to encourage import and export trade. They will cover the loss if goods shipped to the mainland via Hong Kong are destroyed by × aircraft within seven days of storage. However, before the goods are transported to the ships, most are on vessels anchored midstream. Although the transfer distance is short, there are still various risks. Accidental events such as typhoons capsizing boats occur frequently in Hong Kong. If a boat is carrying goods, it will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, Hong Kong trading companies routinely purchase additional insurance from insurance companies when goods are loaded. If an accident occurs on the boat, the insurance company will compensate for the loss. There is no fixed term for this insurance, which merchants find convenient. However, these insurance companies have not been able to accommodate the Hong Kong insurance regulations. If insured goods are on a boat for more than 24 hours, they are not liable for compensation. Export ships are often delayed in arriving in Hong Kong for various reasons. Merchants find it difficult to unload the goods from the boat, which is very inconvenient, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Actress Glories Deu Leaves Hong Kong After Only a Few Hours: "Traveling in the Orient is Always Risky, With the Danger of Death at Any Moment"</h3>
<p>Hollywood movie star Glories Deu passed through Hong Kong on the French postal ship "Athos II" on the 22nd, accompanied by her husband, George Shimens. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at 6:40 PM yesterday, and continued sailing south to Saigon at 2:00 AM this morning. Therefore, the Deu couple only had a few hours to tour Hong Kong, and their visit was very hurried. She was surrounded by reporters upon landing, and her conversation was very "humorous." According to her, she had longed for the scenery of the Orient for a long time. When she announced her trip to the East in Hollywood, people there regarded her as mad and said that traveling in the East was a risky undertaking, with the danger of death at any moment, it is said.</p>
<h3>A Yacht Arrives in Hong Kong from Shanghai, The Entire Trip Takes 160 Hours</h3>
<p>Mr. Huadiya, a senior official of the former Shanghai French Concession Public Works Department, recently built a steel-hulled yacht in Shanghai. It weighs 65 tons and is 72 feet long, named "Gabrielle II". On the 12th of this month, Mr. Huadiya, along with his assistant Bang Sa and two Shanghai Meteorological Observatory staff members, Weiboao, and five sailors, one public servant, and one cook, set sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong. They arrived safely on Thursday last week and docked opposite the Army Club in Wan Chai. According to Mr. Dai Sa, who spoke to reporters, "When we left Shanghai, the wind was blowing from the southeast. The ship sailed using both sails and motors. Two days later, we arrived at Haitan Island at the mouth of the Taiwan Strait. Due to bad weather, we stayed there for two nights and then continued south. We encountered many merchant ships and steamers along the way. The weather was excellent at first, but then the waves became very large. The ship's speed was five nautical miles. The entire trip from Shanghai to Hong Kong took 160 hours," he said. It is reported that Huadiyas will stay in Hong Kong for a short time and will sail to Vietnam during the day. The yacht is well-equipped and beautiful, with radio, electric ice refrigerator, generators, etc. There are three bedrooms, a bathroom, a dining room, and a kitchen.

<h3>Official News: Old Nickel Coins to be Abolished from August 1st; Total Issue Amounted to 1.63 Million Dollars; After Active Recall, Only 210,000 Dollars Remain</h3>
<p>In order to unify the subsidiary currency and eliminate the harm caused by counterfeiters to merchants, the Hong Kong government issued new one-cent and five-cent coins some time ago to replace the old currency in circulation. At the same time, it actively recalled the old currency. To date, the old currency that has been recalled accounts for more than 60% of the total amount. The date for announcing the abolition of the old currency has been repeatedly extended and has not yet been determined. According to official news, the authorities, with the assistance of merchants, have achieved considerable results in recalling the old currency since announcing the recall. It is estimated that the total amount of one-cent and five-cent subsidiary coins issued by the Hong Kong government some time ago was 1.63 million dollars. As of now, nearly 1.4 million has been recalled. Approximately 250,000 dollars are still in circulation in the market. It is expected that another 100,000 dollars can be recalled this month. The remaining 150,000 dollars are expected to have flowed out of Hong Kong, and some may have been lost. The date for abolition has been repeatedly postponed and has not yet been announced. Recently, an instruction has been received from the British government to set August 1st of this year as the date for announcing the abolition. After the announcement, Hong Kong merchants should promptly collect and exchange the old currency to assist the government in completing the entire task of unifying the subsidiary currency, it is said.</p>
<h3>Conflict Erupts Again in the Isolated Army Camp; Two Attempts to Escape Are Prevented by Guards; Fortunately, No Fatalities Occur</h3>
<p>The Dongjiang garrison engaged in fierce fighting with the × army in Shenzhen, in the Sino-British border area, last winter. Due to straying off course, they mistakenly entered British territory and were escorted to the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp and detained. Over the course of several months, the isolated army was determined to resist × and dissatisfied with their daily living conditions. Therefore, they often thought of escaping the camp and returning to the country to serve. Three months ago, secret escapes occurred one after another, resulting in deaths from guard shootings, which caused a sensation for a time. Recently, it was discovered that conflicts between the isolated army in the camp and the guards occurred again last week. The authorities dispatched armed police to quell the situation, preventing a major disaster. The above news occurred several days ago, but it was not until yesterday afternoon that reporters obtained official confirmation. The occurrence of this conflict was the third time. When two incidents occurred in succession in a few weeks, the authorities felt that the matter was becoming serious and dispatched more armed police to guard the camp, so that they could stop any disputes at any time. It is heard that the date of the most recent incident was last Friday. A part of the isolated army attempted to secretly leave the camp again, thinking of digging a tunnel to escape, but was stopped by the guards. On Saturday, when the isolated army was exercising in the open space inside the camp, they refused to return to the dormitory and clashed with the guards, using stones as weapons to attack the guards. The situation was quite serious at the time. Fortunately, the armed police arrived quickly to suppress the situation, quickly sent the isolated army back to the dormitory, and added locks, and the matter subsided. On Sunday, a part of the isolated army outside the dormitory thought of escaping again, but was stopped by the armed police. After the repeated incidents, the situation in the camp did not return to calm until this week. The motive for the isolated army's repeated attempts to escape was purely dissatisfaction with the living conditions. The government is now considering moving the isolated army to a more secure location, but for some reason, it has not yet been implemented. However, judging from the repeated unfortunate incidents in the Ma Tau Chung camp, the relocation of the camp is a matter of urgency, it is said.</p>

Our army’s morale was high, and they immediately intercepted the × with dense broadswords. By 11:00 a.m., the × enemy had reinforced with over 100 troops and a small cavalry unit, continuing their offensive aggressively. At that time, a certain battalion of the 7th Security Regiment also arrived for reinforcements, and a fierce battle unfolded. By evening, the × enemy had increased their tanks by more than ten and their troops by more than two hundred. The 3rd and 10th Security Regiments, as well as a certain unit under Deng Longguang, continued to arrive.

In addition to ordering the various armies to vigorously advance, he is also transferring a certain Guangxi army commander and others to reinforce the Xinhe front line to participate in the battle.

The × enemy in Huicheng is in a state of great panic and quickly burned down villages outside the East Gate, extending for several miles. This action is to prevent our guerrilla forces from lying in ambush. The extent of the x enemy's panic is evident.</p>
<h3>Various Public Organizations Strictly Limited to Move to Shaoguan</h3>

There have been no major engagements in the past month, so the x army's defenses are lax and their morale is low. Our guerrilla detachment of more than 300 troops took advantage of the situation and attacked the × army camp on the night of the 19th, setting out in three routes from Machao, Zongli, and Liaobu.

<h3>Prohibit Opium Completely by the End of Next Year; Li Hanhun Telegraphs Commissioners and County Heads to Complete Smoker Registration by a Deadline</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Quick News) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun telegraphed each district commissioner's office and instructed the county mayors, stating, "The registration of opium smokers is a fundamental measure for banning opium. Before March of this year, the Civil Affairs Department telegraphed the commissioners to supervise the subordinate counties to earnestly handle the matter. Now, it has been almost two months since this telegram was sent, and the counties have not effectively implemented it, which is extremely lax. It must be understood that the central government's opium ban plan requires the completion of the ban by the end of 1929. Since taking office, I have made the greatest determination to follow the central government's instructions and intensify efforts. Now, the ban period is approaching. If the counties continue to procrastinate and fail to complete the task by the deadline, how can they answer to the central government and the people? You are urgently instructed to immediately supervise your subordinate counties, step up their work, and complete the registration on schedule without any omissions to facilitate implementation. You must also report the progress of compliance."</p>

<h3>Net Underneath the Pole Vault Bar Replaces Sandpit: Invention of an American Veteran Coach; Records May Reach Sixteen Feet</h3>
<p>[Los Angeles Dispatch] Mr. Monte Van Maer, a 70-year-old veteran coach of the Southern California Athletic Association, recently, considering that world pole vaulters often suffer injuries upon landing after clearing the bar, as well as the psychological impact on performance, has proposed using a rope net instead of the commonly used sandpit or wood shavings. It is said that after adopting this new method, not only will injuries be reduced, but the world pole vaulting record will likely be increased by several inches or even over a foot. In his decades of coaching experience, Mr. Monte has witnessed pole vaulters fall and get injured numerous times, such as the famous athlete Midu (pole vaulting record holder) of the University of Southern California. Therefore, Mr. Monte has come up with a unique idea, imitating the rope nets used by "trapeze artists" in circuses, and setting up a pole vault landing net. This net has an area of ​​six feet long and ten feet wide, installed on a steel frame with wheels, and rope nets are stretched on the steel frame. The net is about eight feet above the ground, so those who fail to clear the bar can still run through under the net without accidents. Mr. Monte believes that after the danger of falling from a high altitude is eliminated, the current world record of fourteen feet, eleven and three-fifths inches will undoubtedly be raised to sixteen feet.</p>

<h3>From Ancient Greek Negotiations to Various Aspects of the Olympic Movement</h3>
<p>— Ding Lao</p>
<p>—One of the Most Valuable Histories of Sports—</p>
<p>Thus, the ancient Greek Olympic Games were revived. This is the reason for the modern international games. We can say that the revival of the Olympic spirit is the most effective education policy in modern times. Therefore, the second half of the nineteenth century, known as the era of Physical Renaissance, stands in contrast to the literary Renaissance of the fifteenth century, and has equivalent value in the history of human evolution. In 1886, the world began to organize sports associations. Five years later, the Pan Achaean Athetic Assaciation was organized. When Coubertin held a meeting in Paris in 1894, Trikups, a politician who had served as Prime Minister of Greece three times, was worried about financial difficulties and abandoned the railway project from Athens to Salonika. However, he made every effort to advocate holding the first conference in Greece for the international competition. Coulerin prepared a budget of 35,000 Greek coins, intending to seek donations from Prince Constantine, but all failed. It was not until Triknpi resigned that the plan was realized. The venue was funded by the Greek tycoon Aucroff with 20,000 Greek coins and built entirely of marble. Thus, the festival of Atticus (a friend of Emperor Hadrian) in 121 BC was revived, which was from April 5th to 13th, 1896.</p>
<p>Biography of CupeaausN</p>
<p>In modern times, European sports are roughly formed in three core styles: German popular gymnastics associations Turuverein, Swedish school gymnastics, and British athletic sports. Later, due to the convenience of transportation, international contacts between countries gradually increased, and the isolated gymnastics have a tendency to merge into one. Therefore, in 1881, Rucolus isncuperus of Antwerp initiated the United Organization of National Gymnastics Associations of European Countries, that is, the preliminary meeting of the alliance was held on July 23 of that year. From the 14th to the 16th of August one thousand and nine hundred and ninety six, the conference was held again for three days to coordinate the five days starting from July 3rd, 1897. In the complete Gymnastics Alliance in Russces Fcdcratf On Ecl c c Bc Gzmn astipuc (Ecegi chc Turntud), Akcrus was elected as the chairman of the standing committee, agreeing on the main points of the gymnastics alliance, publishing gymnastics publications, exchanging documents with each other, and receiving gatherings of nationals from various countries, completely separating the religious and political meanings, only recognizing the participation of national institutions, without the rules of participation conditions. This association's attitude specifies the types of quality regarding competition. Regarding the purpose of the alliance, the signatories who agree are Pelgion Czoecbfrench Rditish [The natonal physical Kecration Society, Amateur gym a tic and Fencing association, irish amanteur gymnastic asociation scottish amsteugymnastic association andlater the welsh ama teurgymnnsuc association] Italian luxemeury swdish danish and other national groups. However, the gymnastics alliances of Germany and Switzerland, as well as other small organizations in the Balkan region, Russia, Finland, orlugal, etc., did not join. The alliance compiles and publishes a yearbook every year. Since 1897, the meeting place of the alliance conference has changed each time, and the occurrence of the International Olympic Games awaited Carpetin. (10)</p>
