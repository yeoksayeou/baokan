<p>社評</p>
<h3>論蘇聯出兵援華的前提</h3>
<p>前日本港各報登載重慶電訊稱，孫院長哲生在招待文化界席上演說，論及蘇　出兵援華的條件三種，非常正確而合乎科學的分析，是值得一般國民注意的。今日本報特將孫院長該項演詞全文報戴，並加以引申。記得去年五六月間，蘇聯出兵的問題曾因「抗戰三日刊」的記載掀動了武漢文化界的一大爭論，但在我們的見解，這一問題的核心在於世界的客觀倏件，而不在於蘇聯的主觀倏件，我們要決定蘇聯是否出兵援華，或何時出兵，應該考察蘇聯出兵的客觀情勢是否成熟。所以孫院長所提條件的論斷，是比前此武漢文化界爭論本問題的任何一派的論點，皆精確而合於理論。</p>
<p>說到蘇聯出兵援華的主觀條件是很成熟了，因為蘇聯社會主義國家根基的穩固，是和日本×國主義的發展，處於不能相容的情勢下。這不但是因為一般　說「蘇日世仇」的關係，其最主要的原因在於兩個體制的主導矛盾的存在。蘇日兩個體制的主導矛盾，不僅表現於蘇日兩國直接的鬥爭上，並且間接表現於對華的政策上。日本統治者不但在其國內嚴厲壓抑其所恐慌的所謂「由蘇聯傳來的共產思想」，並且在對華的侵略上裝上「防止共產思想傳染」的口實。日本帝國的侵略者不但要吞併中國全士，並且要再度「遠征」西比利亞。前幾年竟有一個日本武官批判日本陸軍當局不能在「九一八事變」當時乘蘇聯的東方軍事建設未完備的時候進佔西比利亞，結果坐大了蘇聯在遠東的勢力。這一批判竟然掀起了日本軍政界的大波，郎在現在還有許多日本侵略者演習着這一破碎的夢，可見日本侵略者不容蘇聯勢力在東方存在的偏見如　深刻。此點在蘇聯政府及人民也知之甚詳感覺最為深切。同時，中國之存亡對於蘇聯國力在東方的發展，具有舉足輕重的决定力，所以蘇聯出兵援華的主觀條件，是絕對不成問題的問題</p>
<p>蘇　出兵援華問題的中心在於客觀條件的是否具備，而在許多客觀條件當中，要推「英美法民主國家聯合蘇聯四國一致立諒解行動共同制裁暴×。」（正如孫院長所言）為首要。現在這種條件已日漸成熟，最重要的關鍵在於美國。美日的衝突不但因為日本在實際行動上破壞了「九國公約」的原則而演至肉搏的地步，最近更因德日陰謀攫奪中南美洲的權益，使美國感到切膚之痛。所以羅斯福總統之欲施行對日經濟制裁，已由對議會的希望而進至要求了。不但美國政府貸與中國以鉅額借欵，堅持維護中國抗戰强力一環的法幣穩固，美國議會且在討論修改中立法案的問題，以便實際參加世界特別是太平洋的鬥爭。美國能决心積極制裁日本，則英國與法國自可不成問題。因為英國在遠東的地位，隨日本進侵華南而已起了極大的變化，不但英國在華的權益，喪失殆盡，卽英法兩國的東方殖民地也皆大受威脅了。再者，日本在東方的得勢，又問接助長其帮兇的德意在歐洲對英法的壓迫。英法一般人民及輿論界又在積極要求政府制裁日本，則無論英法政府怎樣想和德意談判，求得一時的妥協，但其制止日本的兇焔必不致擱淺。到英美法的一致行動戍熟時，蘇聯將更增加這個一致行動的更大力量。</p>
<p>最近在日本方面逼使蘇聯對日更積極行動的條件，已因近衛肉閣瓦解平沼內閣成立，而於軍部與右翼法西斯的更進一步的勾結下，日漸擴大着。前此日本陸軍次官東條對軍火商人發表對中蘇同時作戰論，當時固然是恫嚇的手勢，但由手勢而變成實演，是有很大的可能性的。東條雖然因為財界的不滿而被調開，末次內相也因過於顯露鋒芒而與池田財相同時下台，但是平沼內閣此後將以更大的陰謀，欺騙日本人民，政黨，乃至一部分財閥，是可以預斷的。龐大的軍事預算案及總動員法的實施法案，勢須通過議會，其斯騙的方式將更花樣翻新，百出無窮的。日本×國主義內部的矛盾，只有轉移全國的注意於對外　問題上始有一時緩和的效果，日本統治者自「九一八」以來的作法，盡是這一套把戲。此後擴大事變再來温習張鼓峯的「玩火」，自然也是未來戲法之一種。日本侵略者不但積極謀向西北進攻，並更進一步和帮兇的德國勾結，取東西夾攻的作法。在這種情勢下，蘇聯自然更要積極防備，改守為攻，「準備對任何侵略者之打擊，還以兩倍或三倍以上的打擊」及「較張鼓峯更大的打擊」。蘇聯已决心收囘遠東四十個軍事漁區，在日本則堅持樸資茅斯條約的規定，那末，蘇日的糾紛將更深化，侵略者欲以武力解决糾紛，則孫院長所申論「日本進軍攻擊蘇聯領土」的條件成熟，而蘇聯出兵援華就完全實現了。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯出兵援華還有一個更重要的前提，就是中國自己　抗戰到底。蘇聯欲與中國切實合作以打倒共同敵人的日本帝國，是出於誠意，是無可　疑的。正如孫院長所言，蘇方早卽向中國提議訂立「互助協定」，其决心可見。在第一期抗戰最高潮的徐州會戰時期，蘇聯在張鼓峯打擊「玩火者」，後又為抗戰動搖份子在參政會提議什麽德意外交路綫而蘇日戰爭結束。這些都在證明我們抗戰與蘇聯出兵援華的關聯性了。抗戰轉入第二期以來幾次的最高將領會議，特別是蔣委員長最近在西北召集的將領會饑，决定了許多促進中蘇密切合作的議案，外傳什麽什麽委員會的成立，就是這種趨向的綜合表現，蘇聯出兵援華，只等侯客觀條件更具體的成熟罷了。我們主觀的努力，就是最主要的一環。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年一月七日到十三日</p>
<p>光明在向我們招手！</p>
<p>勝利在向我們招手！</p>
<p>這是我們述評新年的第一週時事所得的結論。現在是第　週了。這一個星期，無論從全世界看，從　中國看，都是更加熱鬧了。這種熱鬧的情形，還是告訴我們，全世界在向光明走，中國已經踏上勝利之途。雖然，我們前面的阻難還狠多，但巳不能嚇退我們。</p>
<p>肅奸運動的發展</p>
<p>首先要報告的，還是我們全國規模的奸運動的發展。因為過去抗戰十八個月、為了漢奸×探親日份子的存在，我們前綫將士和各地同胞，不知遭遇到多少驚人的冤枉的死亡與損害，今日如不澈底肅淸，將來更是不堪設想。汪兆銘通×投降叛黨賣國的陰謀敗講以後、大家認淸平素主張和平主張反共主張現日櫛德意的份子，完全投到漢奸的路上去了—從此以後，×人漢奸不能在我政府在我抗日戰綫裏找到伙伴，這是我們不幸中的大幸。然而×奸這次陰謀敗露以後，仍在最後掙扎，少數腐化的守舊的份子，對抗戰結果疑慮的盲目份子，和汪等親日分了所私辦的宣傳機關，便成為×奸最後掙扎的武器。因此這一星期裏·李宗仁·白禧李漢魂等一再電請緝汪正法之外，反汪肅奸運動，從前線將士到後方民衆，從滬港各界到海外僑胞，更熱烈地展開了—現在所應注意的，第一是罪大惡極的親日主和的漢好及其工具，不應再予寬容，因為對×奸寬容便是對民衆對國家的罪惡；第二是謹防株連無辜，從前接近漢奸的能够回頭向善，便是民族英雄；此外特別要認淸任何主張和平停戰反共反蔣分裂的，實際都已　成×奸的別動隊，我們要加意警衛！</p>
<p>政治軍事大進步</p>
<p>我國政冶上軍事上的重大進步，壓倒了並且粉碎了×人漢奸以及汪等一切的無恥謠言。</p>
<p>就以本週公開的消息而言，最近蔣委員長和中樞負責當局及各黨派黨政軍領袖如毛澤東周恩來彭德懷等數度會談，結果都極圓滿。如中樞機構的加强，地方行政機關的改善，各省　縣參議會的限期組織成立，抗戰建國綱領的切實推行等，可見政治上的進步，×奸謠傳注離渝後中樞動搖之說完全無稽，又如共產黨再三號召擁護蔣委員長，擁護國民政府，擁護懲　决議，以及八路軍新四軍的完全隸屬於軍委會指揮，陜甘寧邊區行政的完全隸屬　國民政府，這種國共密切合作事實，更證明空言反共反八路軍反邊區，只有為×好所快而已。此外蔣委員長親自主持了西南西北的兩次重要軍事會議，結果對於全盤抗戰軍事，有了新的措施，淪陷區的改名游擊區，綏察熱冀　魯　皖浙贛特別戰區司令部的建立與大量生力軍的挺進，是最明白的表現。又隨着為委派白崇禧朱紹良蔣鼎文分別專　指揮西南西北軍事之後，現又派定中央軍校敎育長陳機承為令國新兵訓練處處長，於川黔滇三省訓練兵二千二百萬，以作各軍補充及收復失地之用。依照新的戰略，决定全國兵力「，以三分之一深入×後，三分之一扼守正面要點，其餘準備訓練抽　。這種軍事進步，是×奸所不敢正視的！</p>
<p>兩個後方的門爭</p>
<p>配合着抗戰建國新階段的新需要，决定了我們當前加緊發展兩個後方的鬥爭。一方面是加緊建設我們自己的後方，迅速完成未來反攻與建國的一切準備，一面加緊爭取×軍後方的發展。「到×人那邊去爭主權爭士地去！』這不只是對付一般盲目的反共份子的當頭棒喝，而應該成為不移的戰　綱領的。中共領導下的八路重新四軍早在那麽幹，而且有很好的成績。據前幾天離重慶返防的彭德懷說，僅以八路軍言，過去一年內，在察冀晉三省，搶殺日軍共五分之一，奪獲步槍九千一百枝，大砲十九門，小鋼砲卅門，機關槍五百，並斃日旅團長聯隊長三員。而且現在『政治重於軍事，後方重於前方，民衆重於兵士，游擊戰重於陣　戰，宣傳重於組織」，不只為中共的戰略，並經中央最高軍事當局明令確定為今後基本戰　綱領，軍委會已成立特種機構，集中黨政軍三方面的力量，共同對付×軍政治力量的進攻，並用以摧毀有所濱妤及傀儡組織。至於自己後方鬥爭的發展，除了澄淸政治發動民衆趕練新兵以外，並在將委長與川滇黔軍政當局迭次會議，商决積極從事經濟開發與建設工作，如重工業的興建，交通網的發展，這種消息，像前綫　報一樣雪片飛來，象徵着未來新中國的光明幸福！</p>
<p>一週抗戰大勝利</p>
<p>隨着政治軍事的進步，兩個後方鬥爭的展，這一週抗戰形勢，開始了空前的好轉。特別值得重視的是山西　綫的大勝。從十二月下旬起，×人配合着近衛官言和汪兆銘叛愛，策動了大規模的『山西大掃蕩』的五路進攻，想藉口强調他們『反共』的宣傳，一面也想試我實力或乘我不備，展開進攻曲北的大戰。而然兩星明來，我們先機制×，奪回吉縣，大寗鄉寗，蒲縣等山西戰爭要地，×軍陣亡的十分一，受傷逃散與被俘的不計其數。這次勝利，証明了鞏固的統一戰綫領導下的西北抗戰力量的無敵，更證明了日奸所謂『反共』軍力的日趨薄弱—此外各游擊區的戰鬥，已逐漸發展。主要的是江北我軍收復溧陽，蘇北×軍巳逐漸肅淸，江南我軍圍攻杭州，東綫×軍因此狼狽萬狀。在這種戰鬥之中，我們正面戰事，不僅有湘贛鄂　的繼續穩定，並且有華南方面的　動總反攻，現在廣州仍在我軍大包圍之下，東江我軍並乘勝克復增城，衝入石龍，西江方面則開始反攻水的步驟，以攻止攻，已獲第　一步成功了。特別值得附帶報告的是我軍的機械化配備，正任普遍發展，而空軍方面，更有新的補充及擴編，一反觀×軍則一籌莫展，對於未來大戰，我們是極可樂觀的。</p>
<p>五中全會的展望</p>
<p>然而我們並不能過分的看重這些樂觀的因素，我們同時還應該警惕：我們光明勝利的前途，還有許多障礙和陷阱，我們要保陣上述各種令人樂觀的事實繼續發展，首先便要隨時提防和打擊×人漢奸的陰謀活動，我們更加團結，更加統一，更加爭取政治上軍事上經濟上外交上以及民衆運動上的進步。正在這個時候，領導全民挨抗戰建國的國民黨，快要召集五中全會了。本報已在本月十日社評，提供許多意見。特別為全民一致要求的，第一是國民黨本身組織應　健全，紀律應更嚴明，排斥守舊份子，力爭前進；第二是成立團結各黨領導全民抗戰建國的民族聯　。永遠粉碎×奸挑撥離間分離分裂的運動。第三是使三民主義靑年團向全國愛國年開門，健全並充實兵組織及工作，廣泛大量地　鍊抗戰建國的靑年幹部。第四是　大宣傳與切實推行抗戰建國綱領。我們深信這次全會一定能比去年的臨全大會產生史光榮更偉大的果實；我　敢請中委諸公特別努力，更望全國人民熱烈擁護。</p>
<p>日本困難的嚴重</p>
<p>現在、讓我們放開眼光·來看看×國日本吧！日本從上一星期成立了平沼新內閣以後，原想一新天下視聽，稍稍洗脫過去一年在中國所受的苦痛與恥辱。可是結果新內閣的誕生，不僅不能引起國際上任何較好的批評，英美法蘇各國固然一致指斥『日本政治的更加趨向法西斯侵略，必然會增加與和平正義各國的衝突』，連日本盟友的德意，除了幾句敷衍酬應詞語而外，甚至不瞅不；並且又引起全國人民對統治者更大的憂慮與怨恨。新內閣第一步就不能在暴力之外解决總動員法及龐大預算案的難關，而政黨財明軍閱等統治營壘內的鬥爭，却變本加厲地發展起來。至於對外緩和英美法蘇與日對立關係，更因法西斯侵略與遠東霸權的不可分性而絕無希望。八日倫敦電稱英國觀察報即曾就日本絆濟實况指出：「凡深悉日本國情者，當不致驚異其崩潰之即將發生了」！該報並提出：『日本工業之加緊生產，與工人痛苦之增重，影響人民之精力與出產品質。　術人材之衰落，大减日本急需之戰爭原約之輸入。日圓雖名值二先令，而國外市塲上祇值　辨士。日本大衆尤其農民，已臻無以為生之境！』至於在華戰事的困難更不待言。九日晨何應欽將軍報告亦稱：『我們的國軍是愈戰愈强，而×人則因難速戰速决，精神上已受極大打擊，而軍費消耗月需三萬萬日圓，兵員死傷迄今已達七十萬人，飛機損失二八五一架，軍艦受傷五百八十餘艘，其國內反戰空氣益澎脹，作戰部隊厭戰情緒日厚，國內久有百年戰爭宣傳』足見人已失戰勝信心，暴露其因難的嚴重。</p>
<p>侵略集團新姿態</p>
<p>不祗日本，其餘法西斯侵略者的實情形，也是這樣，他們的對外侵略戰爭，不僅不　解决他們國家與人民的經濟危機，（因為他們的戰爭提本不是眞為其國家民族人民謀利益的勝利），而且加深了他們國內的危機，成熟了革命的條件，因此法西斯戰魔更不能不加緊發動對外的戰爭，並且更加互相勾結起來擴大戰爭，新年這兩個星期來，日本平沼內閣固然明言，將進一步團結日德意『反共』侵略集團，德意外交當局財政當局戈林，里賓特洛甫，沙喊特，齊亞諾等更是東西南北，四處活動，軍事嚇詐，此息彼起，而意德成立征服歐洲的秘密協定，亦為外交界從各方面的　告而加以證實。本週內匈　衛突的起伏不息，德波交涉的連日進行，羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫的勸蕩，中歐東歐地中海以至小亞細亞各地法西斯侵略者魔手與蹄痕的亂舞，充分證明了德意法西侵略者擴大世界大戰的野心。如果各和平民主國家不再加以有力的抵統，這種野心必然將有更大的發展，美國駐英大使坎納第及駐法大使布力特兩氏的報告，更依據歐洲若干事實而指出這種傾向實在值得各方注視與警備的，然而侵略陣線同時亦不是不可抵抗的力量，離且恰恰相反，他們　困難是一天一天增重着，發展着；特別是在金融寡頭從它策動的戰爭中飽收盈利之時，留下了它的國家和人民的更嚴重的貧困，這種貧困將便侵略者發見其本身的懸空；另一方面則在聯聯和平的策動影響下，全世界廣大羣衆已漸覺悟，聯合準備起來走上他們解放自己的大路。本月九日法國西南部意大利農民百萬人的抗議意大利侵略大會，抗議法西斯侵略北菲洲，及進攻西班牙的運動，只是一個隨手招到的例子。</p>
<p>羅馬會談無結果</p>
<p>英意羅馬會談，是慕尼黑會議當時計劃中之一部份工作的實現。經過慕尼黑一會，法西斯侵略者的嚇詐獲得『合法』的『勝利』，英法在歐洲的地位大為降落，以至於日漸陷於孤立狀態。法西斯侵略者便思進一步征服歐洲，德意兩國分道揚，共同作戰。意大利更企圖利用英國一部份政治家在四强合作下重振英國歐洲霸權的空想，進一步削弱法國，征服西班牙，揚威地中海。這次羅馬會談，便是法西斯意大利實行這種野心的主要的工具，與實行進軍的第一步。那時預定談判的主要議案，一是如何調整英意關係，二是如何解决西班牙戰事，三是如何緩和與解决法意開的爭執；此外還包括有經濟問題以至建立四強政治軸心，歐洲新神聖同盟等等。可是一方面全世界特別是英法兩國愛護和平與民主的羣衆已經警悟，而自開始英勇反對與法西期侵略者合作運，動，另一方向法西斯侵略者在英法退讓後更大猖狂的事實，和美國政府進步的呼　與政策，也開始警告了英法的當局；因此英相在赴意前迭開閣議，並先徵求法國意圖，便有不能再　讓步的準備。十二日會談開始，革國進步政黨，新黨及法國當局，都弁國內羣衆熱烈運動下表示反對讓步，所以至十二日正式會談結束，法童問題始終不能提也。英意關係亦無切實談到，西班牙問題則因意大利無意中止侵路。亦無具體結果。　　　　的失敗，本在，中，但是英法仍　澈對法西斯便略者的妥協政策，則前途還不能『不了了之』。</p>
<p>和平陣線發展了</p>
<p>現在誰也明白，唯一有效的保衛和平弭息戰爭的辦法，是各和平民主國家密切聯合起來，以一切實際力量武裝力量，對法西斯侵略者實施制裁。希特勒登台後已經存在的第二次帝國主義大戰，雖然祗限於帝國主義國家中間的國家慘　侵略與覆滅，如阿比西尼亞，奧大利捷克等；但是慕尼黑會議以後，戰事的發展己經逼到帝國主義互相間的正面衝突了！侵略陣線與和平陣線更加分明地對立起來了—一切保衛民主與和平的國家，不能不斷然堅定其反法西斯侵略的立塲，並且互相聯合起來。而且準備的時機也快要過去，不迅作斷然表示，只有被捲入且犧牲於法西期戰大之中。美國便首先在這大戰危機的第一綫上扎起來，羅斯福幾統繼續上週反法西斯侵峪的大聲疾呼之後，本週又正式宣佈在大西洋長駐艦隊，並積極發展太平洋方面的海空戰備，接着選諮文國會，要求授權裁制日德等侵略國家，美國這種表示不能不使英國大受感動，這一週內英國當局已在全國進步人民與羣衆的督促下，開始表現積極起來。特別對於遠東，表示願與美國等合作，加緊援華制日的步驟。明天國聯行政院開會，討論中日問題時，至少將表現於我更趨有利的形勢。特別值得報告的是，在此英美態度逐　好轉之際，我國的國際地位亦將更為優利，蘇聯亦有更進一步援助的可能，本週內中菲協定中愛協定的成立，尤可顯見只有堅持團結抗戰，才有更光明更勝利的前途！我們的奮　，不僅關係着自己的命運，國　的命運甚且，還有推進世界于光　之途的　大意義！努力吧！自由之神已替我們燃起勝利的火炬！</p>

<h3>中辦關係　立法院長</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>——在招待重慶文化界席上演詞——</p>
<p>各位先生、今天這個第會、是前幾天邵先生有一點意見，覺得中蘇關係、我們沒有機會和大家談談、所以建議舉行今天這個集會、原來邵先生的意思、要兄弟藉現在道個機會、把中蘇關係、簡單向各位報告一下、也司以提起各位對於中蘇問題的興趣、同時希望對於各位中有懷疑的地方、來說明一下、</p>
<p>自從七七蘆溝橋戰事發生以來、在各人心理上、大槪都有一種希望、希望我們友邦能援助中國、打擊我們的×人、尤其是對于蘇聯方面這個希望更加懇切、所以一年半以來、很多朋友們談話、提起我國外交路綫及抗戰前途、總免不了的一個疑問、就是蘇聯為什麽不能再進一步作有效的行動、來援叻我們、這的確是領得我們研究的一件事、我們同志、天天鄱想得到一個答覆、這個問題、說起來很複　、不容易在狠短時間以內、　得消　、一般人以為日本是中國唯一的×人、同時日本在遠東方面、也是蘇聯唯一的×人、日本是中蘇共同的×人、日本這次發動侵略我們的戰爭、我們在最高領袖領導之下發動全面抗戰、在蘇聯來看、無論道義上利害上種種立塲、當然是站在中國一方面、希望中國能够澈底抗戰、得到最後勝利、但是日本旣是中蘇兩國共同的×人、似乎應該由兩國出來共同應付、為什麽中國現在在軍事上還是單獨應付呢、這是有很多關係在內的、因為蘇聯方面、在過去十年、都是以和平建國為國策的、惟有保持和平、他們的建設方能够成功、所以蘇聯在革命後最近上年以來、以和平為國策，同時知道這種和平、非聯合世界上愛護和平的國家、共同負起這個責任不可、所以幾年前蘇聯轉變國策、加入國聯、其最大動機、是要聯合英法美及其他和平國家、所謂民主政治的國家、共同努力，來維持世界和平、這是毫無疑義的、自九二八事　發生後、蘇聯當局見到和平工具的國聯、巳經沒有力量，恐怕維持不了、蘇聯就希望與中國</p>
<p>恢復邦交共同保障遠東和平、九一八以後、中蘇兩國就恢復邦交、復交以後、的確是中蘇兩國外交上的一大轉變、應該馬上建立　中蘇兩國友善關係的强固基礎、在這個時候、蘇聯當局很盼望和中國接近、我們一般注意國際情形的人、也覺得中蘇一定要接近才好、但是當時因為國內種種情形、有很多困難、所以中蘇關係、在七七事變前、沒有獲得更大進步、日本看淸中國對蘇聯雖然復交、决不會有更進一步的關係、中國抗戰力量、一定　弱、所以就先行發動向中國侵略、在戰事發生後、當時有很多人責備蘇聯、為甚麽不援助中國、但在蘇聯所以如此、亦有理由、因為中蘇關係、在九一八後、七七以觔、假使能更為接近、則日本决不敢輕易動手、日本所以敢向中國進攻、就是因為中蘇還沒有實際聯合起來、相當時間內、中國一定不　得到外援、所以×人希望速戰連决、戰事發生以後、中蘇兩國旣然沒有條約的義務、蘇聯當局、對於怎樣後助中國、是否應該出乒、當然要審　研究、根據　們的國策、不能把根本方針立刻變史、他們的國策是以和平立國的、關於出兵</p>
<p>共同對日問題、在也們看法、假使在戰　未發生以前、訂有軍事互助協定、則×人一旦進犯中國、蘇聯在條約上、自然負有應援出兵的義　、可惜在蘆溝橋事變前、沒有訂立這種條約、至於沒有訂約的責仟、應該誰負、現在不必研究、不過蘇聯對中國旣沒有條約上的義務、所以他們不出兵援我、是不負任何責任的、</p>
<p>其次、如果要蘇聯出兵、必須日本同時進攻蘇聯、而我們的×人却非　狡猾、覺得以一國的力量、同時對中蘇兩國作戰、難操勝算、尤其對於蘇聯、不敢冒險、所以在蘆溝橋事變以前、曾對蘇聯試探了一次、前年六月間、在偽滿和蘇聯邊境的松花江上、發生衝究、就楚在試探蘇聯是不是有决心和日本作戰、當時蘇聯覺得國防凖備未充、甩不着小題大做、所以對於　事件，表示讓步、結果和平解决、日本以為蘇聯不會動、所以决定先對付中國、希望在很短的時間內獲到結果，因而有七七事變發生、去年七月、×人又義動張　峯事件、我們知　張鼓峯、原係中國的地方、滿清末年、與帝俄劃界、始歸入俄國版圖、張　峯地形、非常險要、一面係高山、南面係圖們江、這個地方、假使建築防禦工事、成一要　、則對于日本在朝鮮圖們江的交通線、有很大的威脅、十年以來、日俄兩方面，對于這個地方都沒有動手、到去年七月初、蘇聯忽然派兵去張鼓峯設防、日本提出抗　、說這個地方是屬於偽滿的、日本大使在莫拗科抗議、蘇聯外交長拿出滿淸劃界地圖、證明該地不在偽滿境內、日本對此事件、非常担心、立志要搶這個地方、隨即派兵搶奪到手、以後蘇聯以飛機重炮轟擊日軍、結果日軍敗退、日本知道蘇聯有備、才屈膝妥協，以避免</p>
<p>日蘇戰爭、這就可以證明日本沒有力量同時來打擊蘇聯、紙能集中力量侵略我國假使、聯能够出兵、　戰事恐怕早已結束了、關於這個題、去年兄弟在莫斯科、蘇聯當局曾提出幾點解釋、在他們立塲來講、蘇聯的同情援助中國、是毫無問　的、就是中國沒有人來提起這個問題、蘇聯也央心援　中國、但是中國希望他們出兵、不是容易做得到的、知果要他們出乒、必須具月　個條件之一、一是國聯執行盟約决議、共同負責來制裁强暴、則蘇聯可負執行任務、假使不通過制裁案、至少也要英美法民主國家聯合蘇聯四國、一致成立說解行、共同制裁暴×、如界以上兩點都做不到、祇有等着日本進犯　聯邊境時、當然自銜抗×、予侵略者以打擊，所以</p>
<p>蘇聯出兵問題、一年前是這樣情形、現在依然還是一樣　、至於蘇聯出兵以外、還有沒有援助我們、援助我們的程度又怎樣，關於這點、我想各位一定很明白的，七七事變以前、蘇聯前任大使囘到中國來、向我們提出這個問題、對於我國有三個希望、一希望中國發起太平洋和平會、二希望中蘇兩國簽訂互不侵犯協定、最後冉簽訂互助協定、當時我們研究的結果、覺得太平洋會議、不易有效、因為日本一定反對、如日本不參加、則英美無法把日本在遠東重要關係置之不理、假使日示來出席　　、則討論太平洋問題時、日本代表一定從中搗亂、這會也不能有什麽效果、所以當時我們以此意見答覆蘇聯、不久蘆溝橋事件發生、所以關於太平洋會議問題、已成過去、不用提了、第二點、中蘇互不侵犯協定、前年八月間已給簽訂、但是互助協定還未進行、因為戰事發生以後、簽訂</p>
<p>互助協定與戰事未發　以前　質完全不同、這種協定目的、在項先防　戰爭、假使七七事變以前、我們與聯簽訂　助協定、則中日戰爭、也許今會發生、所以互助協定、在戰事未發前、是有這種作用的、但是戰事旣經發生、則意義使不一樣了、假使中蘇此時、簽訂互助協定、蘇聯非立刻出兵不可、去年一年間、歐洲局面、動　非常、各　當局、積極想法怎樣維持歐洲和平局面、怎樣來應付歐洲戰爭、存過去一年之中、蘇聯方面、也是從事擴充重備、假定歐戰發生、蘇聯不能袖手旁觀、一定被捲入漩渦、蘇聯在國防軍備上、同時要應付兩方面的敵人、也許很困難、尤其以英美法各國、旣然主張維護歐洲和平、如果蘇聯在遠東取積極行動、就分散了歐洲力量、英美法一定都不願　、朋以蘇聯對我國祗能在道義上外交上物質上來援助、十八　月以來，實際上確已不少、談釗這個地方、　我們</p>
<p>外交路線問題、在幾個月前、兄弟在海外時、聽到第一次國民參政會有人王張所謂　意外交路線、海外傳聞、覺得非常奇怪、我們為什麽這樣糊塗、我們知道標意是×人的與國、走這條路線、除非是預備誚他們介紹我國向日本投降安　、否則如果德意路線能走得通、我們駐　意的大使也不會回來了、這是　我國前仟駐德意大使可以曉得的、自抗戰以來、　意祗和罵中國、不是近代國家、不是開化的民族、是第二個阿比西尼亞、日本才是近代文明國家、以小事人、以弱事强、是天然公理、他們對我們是這樣、我們還希望走這條路終、豈非糊　、</p>
<p>現在我們外交路綫、非常公開、就是英美法蘇的路綫、是和平國家的路綫、我們既親善　聯、同時又和英美法發生密切關係、事實上並不衝突、就是在蘇聯方面、也是這樣希望我們的、在遠東方面、雖然軍備上要數蘇　、但時機未到、而同時蘇聯不願意單獨担負這個責任、蘇聯特別告訴我們、希望中國不要單獨希望</p>
<p>蘇聯援助對於遠東、蘇聯假使當仁不議、不待英美法三國的一致、使挺身而出、日本軍閥、一定對國內宣傳、說他們出兵中國、是為防共、而對國外官傳、也說是防共、並且要說蘇聯旣然帮忙中國、一定是企圖赤化中國，如是則無形增加他們很大的宣傳力量、在英美法方面、不免引起　誤的見解、尤其英國在中國商業上的利益最大、英國不希望日本打敗中國、但是同時又怕蘇聯在遠東出頭、所以在英美法沒有一致以前、假使蘇聯出兵打敗日本、事實上蘇聯成為遠東盟主、勢力澎大起來、則英國方面、一定發生懷疑、也許會聯合其他國家來對付蘇聯、實際上等於來對付中國了、日本侵略中國、中國為求生存而戰、是亳無疑　的、現代世界上的國家、無論民族大小、沒有民族精神、是不能存在的、我們四萬萬五千萬的民族、這種為民族生存而抗戰的精神、一定要有的、所以中國抗戰原因、本來是很單純的、假使因為蘇聯出兵而把情形變為複雜、日本一定說中國是被亦化了，反把中國的解放戰爭、性質弄模糊了、這種情形、在中國和蘇聯　都不好了，所以我們、（未完。請參閱本日社評）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>建立無敵的新空軍</h3>
<p>緊接着抗戰形勢的全面的好轉，這幾天報紙上又紛紛　出我國積極擴充空軍的消息。昨天紐約論壇報載我當局已與美國勃蘭克飛機製造廠簽訂三百五十萬美金的飛磯購　契約，第一批飛機將於三月間蓮華，計有巨型轟炸機二架。此外大批蘇聯飛機與空軍專門人員的陸續來華，更　旣見的事實。我們從×軍飛機轟炸下　出生命，或正在矗炸威脅縣同胞、聽到這個消息，一定感到無比的快慰。因為我們的空軍如果有更大的發展，則不僅可以止制×機的狂轟炸，而且還可以直接以反攻的行動去警告侵略者；而且過去十八個月空軍抗戰經騐，可以証明我們空軍的力量　僅不在×方之下、並且高强數倍，我們不必列舉武漢空戰大勝和義征三島等事實上只看一千八百五十一架×機的損失·（九日何應欽將軍報告）就可明白，在這里還應該明白指出：第一，我們必須堅定反侵略的立塲，力爭國際上更大的援助。國際這種援助不祗有功于中國，並且有助於人類文化；因為侵略者的飛　直到現在正加緊轟炸我廣大後方的無辜民衆，與破壞一切的經濟的建設！第二，我們必須益堅自力更生的信心，用加倍的力量，來擁護政府帮助政府，提高我國在國際的威信。我們要為建立無敵的新空軍而献出人力，献出金錢和擴大宣傳。</p>
<p>兩個大可注意的統計</p>
<p>九日軍政部長何應欽報告，一年來×軍平均每月消耗軍費三萬萬日圓，兵員死傷共達七十萬，飛機被擊毀六四九架，失事損壞二二〇二架。軍艦受傷五百八十餘艘。</p>
<p>同日八路軍副總指揮彭德懷離渝返防發表談話，謂過去一年八路軍在察冀晉三省搶殺日軍五分之一，奪獲步槍共九千一百枝，大砲十九門，小鋼砲三十門，機關槍五百挺，擊毀飛機一百二十四架，並斃×旅團長一聯長二，俘獲×官兵無算。這裏證明了×軍所謂『勝利』的內容，却是×軍最大的失敗所在，這種失敗現正開始，日益擴大，失敗投降主義者沒有　到這一點，同時更證明了八路軍雖在特別困難的環境中，同樣也從×人方面取回勝利，　種勝利絕對不是共產黨一黨，而是屬於全中國的；盲目附和反共的頑固份子，在這裏也失去了立論的根據了。</p>
<h3>英國人對中日戰爭的觀感　一年來的見聞錄　（本報倫敦特約通訊）</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>第一瞥</p>
<p>中國人還是日本人」？</p>
<p>這樣劈頭問着的，是走上火車來搬行李的一个脚夫。一等知道我是中國人，立刻，他就現出了笑容，一面不斷地擲過來許多關於中日戰爭的問題，一面把我一直送到車站外的「塔克些」上，舉起手來行了一个禮，接過錢，道了一聲「希望你好運氣」之後，就關上了車門。</p>
<p>——這一切裏，洋溢着深深的親切感。</p>
<p>「塔克些」在滑濕的路上，由維克多利亞車站，向目的　飛馳了去。坐在車裏的我，就禁不住有這樣的漫想浮上了心頭·原來·這就是我們在國內當為友邦而時時注視着的英吉利的首都。</p>
<p>這是一九三八年一月十三號的晚上十一點鐘，</p>
<p>英國輿論界的態度</p>
<p>構成英國輿論界最重要部份的，當然是報紙。而其中，公然自標著『世界最大銷散』的，是『每日快報』，據說；每天的銷數，是三百萬份以上，和它不同，在英國一般市民層裏，盡着精神食糧任務的，還有『每日郵報』，這兩家，比起任何其他的報紙來，對於英國一般市民層的觀感，都有着較為重大的影響，是道地的『英國報紙』，對於中日一戰的見解，從一年來它們所不時刊戰的社論和文章上分析，同情中國是非常明顯的·然而對實際形勢，似乎有着許多隔膜。所以那結要，就多多少少，要　着戰事演變的限制而表現它們的態度。據記者記憶所及　台兒莊大捷的前後，是我們中國地位在這兩家報紙上的黃金的代；而廣州武漢放秦後的約略十多天內，它們幾乎有意地少載這一方面的新聞。屬於同一類而勢力略次一點的還有兩家，一是『每日見聞報』，一是「反映日報」。</p>
<p>一年來，立場最堅决，態度始終如一的報紙，在英國紙有兩家，一是許多年來向代表英國政府說話的「泰晤士報」二是代表英國共產黨說話的「工人日報」，前者是世界性的報紙，後者是英國工人層的報紙，直到目前，那經費的來源，還大部　讀者們捐助，然而，前者以英國政府的情報為根據，以英國政府的政策為依歸，後者，以第三國際遍佈世界勞力的報告為根據以維護世界社會主義的祖國打倒法西斯為目標，所以無論實際的戰爭演變心樣，在旨趣　，泰晤綫」始終立論的要點是：（一）日本無論如何，戰不勝中國，（二）蔣委員長是中國的偉大領袖，（三）中國的「共產黨」，是不再「缸色」了。而「工人日報」立諭的旨趣，則是：（一）中國一定戰勝日本，問題不過是時間的遲早；（二）「聯合陣綫」是中國這一次戰爭中最有力的武器，（三）推重蔣委員長的領導力，讚揚中國共產黨的政策。他們的立場和熊度始終如一，台兒莊大捷，徐州會戰，以至廣州武漢放棄，這其間，他們絲亳也沒有露過動搖的痕跡。</p>

<h3>郭沫若談　日本政潮　西園寺最後一張牌失敗　侵略政業已山窮水盡</h3>
<p>【本報重慶特約航訊】中國靑年新聞記者　會重慶分會的伙伴們，在昨天下午的警報聲中，開會歡迎他們的名譽理事，新近由　綫回川的政治部第三廳廳長郭沬若先生。</p>
<p>在記者座談會會址，一間小小屋子裏已給裝飾得够精緻的，一張長條的桌子上，滿陳着各種點心，這是他們對於郭先生所表示的一番小小心意！</p>
<p>二十多個靑年伙子，圍若桌子團團坐定，郭先生坐在當中，大家隨隨便便地談，沒有絲毫的顧忌和俗套。</p>
<p>郭先生一開口，就對這一羣靑年人，獎勵了一番，他說：『我們為服務的關係，與靑年記者們比較最接近，知道的也比較多，在第一期抗戰當中，你們的確已辦了最大的責任，對於國家巳有著不可磨滅的貢獻，這是應當向你們表示敬意的！』他的話，使在座的靑年人感到兩頰發熱。</p>
<p>接着郭先生開始購到日本政局轉變的各種問題上來了：</p>
<p>他首先闡述，自維新以來的日本政局，一向是在穩健與少壯兩派手中，翻來復去，兩派都是主張侵華原則是相同的，所不同　　是侵略的手段與態度的差異而已，穩健派以財閥，政黨，元老，重臣為代表，主張採用緩進，從經濟或政治方面，對中國作慢性的侵略，而少壯派以軍部中急進軍人為代表，主張用强便的武力政策，進攻中華，由於這兩派侵華的態度上的差異，使日本政局，終無寧日，過去驚動一時的「五一五』「二二六」等事件，都是由這種差異，所造成的惡果。</p>
<p>在野軍人大鬧京部，大殺國家元首，這都有造成內亂的可能，但事實上，兩次事變都在一個短切間內宣告平息，不曾擴大，這應當全部歸功於西園寺公爵政治手腕的巧妙。</p>
<p>西園寺是目前日本元老重臣幫中所僅存的　果，他是財閥資本家的代言人，對於少壯軍人的橫行政策當然看不過去，因此他利用歷史傳　所給予他的權威，以及他天賦靈活的政治手腕，把少壯軍人，玩弄於掌上，使他們彼此間的磨擦對立的現象，永無消減的一日。</p>
<p>西園寺這種對於少壯派的牽制政策也隨着環境的轉移，而有所變易，在「二二六」事變以前，西園寺每推舉海軍之首出而組閣（如簫　岡田等）目的在藉海軍力量，來毫制陸軍，「二二六」事變之所以禾曾擴大，正是這政策成功的具體表現——關於這一點，郭先生特別引出他當時在東京某地所耳聞的一件事：當『二二六』之日，陸軍橫行於京都，氣燄萬丈，後因海軍的第一二兩大隊在十小時內集中東京灣，威脅陸軍撤退這才平息了這次大亂——而『二二六」以後，西園寺又改變了他過去的方針，推薦陸軍中人物入閣（如宇垣林，以至於近衛等），用以藉陸軍中某一派的力量，來牽制另一派，使其互相傾軋面起分化！然而西園寺的政治手腕，雖萬分高明，終敵不過少壯軍人的瘋狂氣焰，近衛內閣的登台，可說是西園寺的最後一張牌，以為可藉這「面面光「的「政界明星」來給少壯軍人最後打，但結果　歸於失敗，只　眼巴巴　望若一個完好的國家，走向目身毀滅的戰爭道路上去，日本大政治家尾崎幸雄，曾說過讓少壯軍人去碰頭吧，吾則他們的瘋狂氣焰，將永無消止之日，這最能代表穩健派的衷心意見。</p>
<p>現在，日本法西魔王的平沼一郎已經登台了，他是西園寺的死對頭，日本每次新閣未發生前，無不有他組閣的呼聲，但每次都被西園寺所控制，而不能如願，這一次平沼內閣，得在空前記錄的十八小時短期間成立，這反證出西園寺一派緩行政策的愈　沒落！</p>
<p>平沼的上台，在表面上，似乎對中國有更惡劣的影響，而實際上，實是×人侵略政策水盡山窮的表現，最近板垣所　出的七項條件，其內容充　矛盾，平沼且自認日本已到有史以來未有的困難關頭，目前在軍事上旣陷困境國內的政治經濟也日趨崩潰，可知其已距敗亡時期不遠，而反觀教國，抗戰一年半以來，物質損失　重大，而新生力量日益增加，最後勝利之期，當在眼前。</p>
<p>最後，郭先生并提出最低後方生活水準與供應前線文化糧食兩點，希望新聞界人士努力推動。（一，八，經冶。）</p>

<h3>出錢。出力，出性命搶救祖國！　越南華僑服務圑　奇卓　第一批回越補充，第二批昨天抵港</h3>
<p>華僑是酷愛祖國的，尤其是華僑靑年更具有高度的警覺性與火一般的熱情。如捐款　金與回國服務的熱烈，踴躍，簡直像「狂」一般，像潮水洶湧一樣。記者在這裏　要報道的、是昨天剛從越南來到香港的又一枝生力軍。</p>
<p>本來，越南華僑靑年童軍戰地服務　在前年十月間就一行五十餘人、抱着滿腔的熱情回到祖國來服務。嗣奉政府的命令派赴惠州工作，對於防護，救護，宣傳、以及促華軍民合作，都表現了卓著的成績，當記者在惠州時、亦頗敬愛其熱心與努力的赤忱。直至惠陽失陷，該團仍在炮火下勇敢工作，以致遭着巨人的損失。據確實的報告。在戰塲上壯烈犧牲的有四名、失踪未明的有五六名。後來該隊輾轉經　羅增城從化各地而至英德，在傷兵收容所中服務至相當時期，繼後在河源工作，因水土不服，團　多患病、同時各種物質亦須補允，故請准返越南整理補充，都于日前從汕頭抵港，備受此間僑胞之關切與慰勞，該國已决定明天乘輪囘越整理補充，再行回國服務。</p>
<p>昨日下午四時，本港書畫文學社，港　各團社眼災聯台會，中華藝術協進會，印刷業工會，酒　茶室總工，　十餘團體，就假座大東酒店，舉行勸送會，籍表敬意，而勵來　。剛剛在他們這第一批明天暫別祖國的當兒，第二批的靑年，服務員就在昨天抵港投進祖國的懷抱了。</p>
<p>據該隊隊長林隱之君語記者：『第一批囘國服務團雖然在東江遭着莫大的損失，可是安南華僑與靑年仍是以再接再厲的精神復在安南集合團員四中隊共一百名，并募集救　藥品多種·以便救護傷兵難民之用』。記者聽到　裏，內心深深地受其感動。華僑搶救祖國不但是出錢，而且出力，并且犧牲其性命。中華民族有了這樣的子孫，未始不是充分象徵着光明的前途，這是誰亦不能否認的。</p>
<p>林隊長接着再說：這次從西貢乘鯉門輪抵港，是第二大隊第四五兩中隊共四十名，第五中隊係應學年君率領，現暫住本港，將受短時期之救護訓練，聽候該團第六七兩中隊及各種救護藥品抵港之後，即全體出發某戰區服務，經巳電某戰區長官請示，並函本港總商會及各僑　予以指導，協助。』這　自然是僑胞所樂聞的消息。</p>
<p>記者詢及第一批有一部份在東江殉難為國犧牲，對于第二批此次再來祖國服務有何影嚮？林隊長謂：『殉難的團昌當然引起僑胞的敬忡，行將舉行追悼會以慰忠魂。但是，華僑並不怕死，靑年回國服務者仍然是一片赤誠無所顧慮，家長亦允其為國爭光』。記者聽到這裏，又幾乎被感動得掉下眼淚。</p>
<p>記者冉詢　僑胞最近對祖國的感想如何？林隊長答謂：『對于失職之軍政長官與汪精衛之叛變，當然是無限憤慨，　是擁護蔣委員長抗戰到底的信心，則愈加堅决與積極』。這寥寥數語實在是海外廣大僑胞一致的呼聲　未知汪精衛以及一般不忠於抗戰，不忠於國家民族的敗家子，有何面目見諸僑胞！</p>
<p>林隊長因行裝甫卸，萬分忽忙，記者不敢多所煩擾，約定下次談話時間之後，就輿之辭別了。</p>
<h3>難民救星　饒神甫昨日赴滬　深信我國必得最後勝利</h3>
<p>被譽為「難民救星」之饒神甫、自渝飛港後、迄今已有多日、所辦各事、均已就緒、經於昨日趁乘意郵船維多利亞返滬、到輪送行者極衆、饒神甫在輪上接見記者、告以此次赴渝會見我國當局經過、對我民氣之盛、及軍士之勇敢、深表敬慕、并深信我國必得最後勝利云、</p>
<h3>中華業餘學校　兩個藝術新產兒　鐘明　中華業餘劇團和合唱團</h3>
<p>【特寫】最近的兩個月，本港的敎育圈裏，突起了一枝異軍，把歷來商業化而沉寂刻版得令人窒息的港九敎育事業，帶領到光明璀璨的新的一面。這枝異軍便是最近產生在本港文化界的中華業餘學校。它對於許多在職士女的業餘進修，在現在已成為許多有志長進者感到沒得人而向隅了。這固然是這間學校地方小的限制，但也可想見社會人士對于這間學校之感到需要了。</p>
<p>業餘學校開辨了一個多月的成績，在辦事人提倡『集體追求長進』底原則下，舉員們很快的已組織了幾個研究單位，實行集體研究，集體　造文化工作，如文學研究社，新聞學研究會，科學研究會，政治經濟研究會等，這些都在很積極地加緊工作，除這以外，值得介紹給讀者知道的，還有兩個「新產兒」—兩個藝術組織。這兩個組織，一個是中華業餘劇團，一個是中華業餘合唱團。它們組織成立，只有一個多月的時前是有相當經騐的，也許有些正開始研日，現已快要演出。雖然成績不一定能够達到理想，盡如人　，但以這樣　少的組織時間而敢定期公開演唱，總算是驚人的一個舉動。</p>
<p>關於他們的劇團，團員也許有些從究戲劇的，但在他們的講師歐陽予倩，盧敦，李晨　等劇界先進指導之下，最近又請得「中旅」先進唐槐秋先生指導表演，成績將必有可觀，想不是偶然的</p>
<p>關於他們的合唱團，則由前在廣州跟現任國立音專敎務主任陳洪氏組織「三重奏一提倡新音樂運動，而表演活動多年的蔡自新先生担任指揮與訓練，又得後起之秀的女聲家陳專怡女士等幫忙，所以成績也是甚為卓越的，我參觀他們訓練，比之訓練很久的許多合唱團體，實不多讓。前武漢合唱團過港演唱時，不大注重男低音，據蔡君說，尤之乎建屋基礎不穩。因此，他們的男低音是很强固的。他們全團的團員有四十多人，只有三分之二是業餘學校的學員，其他則是外面對音樂有素養的同志，所以實力是頗不弱的。他們如能繼續努力下去，是有很大希望的。</p>
<p>最近，因為業餘學校同人感到沒有一間適合大衆的公共圖書館，認為有急速籌建的必要。因此，這兩個藝術工作的新產兒，負起了前驅的使命，决定於本月十五日（星期日）上午十時在九龍彌敦道平安戲院作處女的演出。有志為社會與僑胞謀福利的士女們，應多踴躍贊助；同時更可一觀這兩個新產兒的登台的藝術如何？</p>
<h3>港督昨舉行　檢閱義勇隊　並頒發功牌</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時半日香港義勇隊、在總部操　舉行檢閱、及頒發功牌典禮、中西士女到觀禮者百餘人、五時半列隊齊集五時四十五分總督夫婦偕同隨從武官駕至，由該隊司令上前歡迎、隨至操塲檢閱、頒發十　人之功牌、并演說、對各得獎者備極嘉勉、同時對義勇隊表達殷切之期望、而對新成立之華人隊更為讀揚備　、　望　壯之華人踴躍入　、總督　謂去年底該隊宿營演習、成續甚佳、殊堪慶　云云、最後舉行雜菓酒會、</p>

<h3>福州鼓山　（四）</h3>
<p>— 邵晏淸</p>
<p>從白雲洞下去、可達鼓山的北麓、名勝中如天梯、龍脊道等、形勢險峻、此外、如佛頭岩、雲屏　、吼雷狄、日月潭、三天門等勝蹟，曁凡聖積翠諸庵，　須可觀、一般善於山行的人、由鼓山南麓登山者、多從這裏下山、惜我們的衣件等、都寄存在山南力湧泉寺裏、只好囘寺一行、因此遺漏了這一段富有刺激性的路徑和峻險的山景、未免感到美中不足、</p>
<p>囘到湧泉寺的歸途、那是一條充滿嵐光黛色的山間小道、和　才巍峨縱闊的山景比起、彷彿　換一境地、其間一草一木、紅葉靑山、似乎都輝映入畫、一路上、各種景像更配台非常緊凑、使　沒有一刻感到乏味的、　的山丘、成林的松柏、到處點綴着、有特轉幾個　、忽然到了懸崖的上　、看那個下深谷　、　伏着一塊的巖石、使你　識到自然的偉大和沉默、有時峯迴路轉、眼前忽然展開了一幅幽倩如畫的景地、那在山坡底下的是一方一方碧綠的田地、沿坡而築的、是通流到湧泉寺的水渠、渠裏面常年流着巖層裏分泌出來的水泉、在這麥駐足一下、傾聽那錚琮的水　、注視一會水波鱗鱗的流泉、也足以消却萬千的俗慮、</p>
<p>抵湧泉寺、日已西斜、大殿裏百來個和尙、正在上晚課、個個都披上了灰色的法衣、寬袍大　、娑婆叩拜、他們的動作、遲純而紆緩、口中喃　地不知道念着什麼經卷、　調低慢而嚴肅、這時兩　魚磬的聲音、此起彼落地相應着、更增加了不少靜穆的意味、我們駐立在門外直看到他們環佛後、才在一陣沉長的「阿——彌陀——佛——」聲中離開了大殿、</p>
<p>在寺中又住一晚、整天的辛勞、經過一夜的酣睡、身子便恢復了、翌晨起來遊覽寺內各虎、原來這座寺的規模非常宏大、　面共有山門三道、那第三道山門上、有已故省府主席方聲濤氏所題之「海天砥柱」四字、寺的正座共有三淮、第一進為天王殿、第二進大排寶殿、第三進法堂、除前面的天王殿外、後面兩進的殿宇、均軒昂寬敞、每進前面有白石鋪砌的廣塲一方、正座的右邊有　樓、寶　倉，戒堂一、禪堂、方丈室、延壽堂、佛學院、佛敎醫院等、左　有鐘　、地藏殿、藏經殿、祖師堂、香積廣、齊堂、庫房、造米所等、冉加上幾座招待吝人住宿的房屋、組織方面、似乎比一個小村落還來得完備、</p>
<p>寺的前面、尙有廣大的菜圃和花園、深綠色的放生池、以及兩幢並立着的新式建築物、一間是紅綠色的房屋、高建在堆砌二丈多高的石塊上、從下面望去、富有宮堡的意味、據說這就是前海軍部長楊樹莊的私人別墅、另一宅名叫「迴龍閣」、那是一座寬闊得像校舍一般的建　物、不知道是誰家施主建的、這兩個新式建築物、替這古老的廟宇、平添上一番蓬勃的生氣、此外第一進前面的廣塲　、還有一方小水潭、正對着寺的正座、潭曰「羅漢泉」潭內泉水湧溢、終年不息、『湧泉寺』的名稱、即由此而　、</p>
<p>從寺東南隅的一扇小石穿出去、再下了幾十層的門階、便進入了一處兩巖夾峙間的隙地、在這塊地的盡頭、有一間木板建的僧　、樓前橫着一條小石橋、橋下直通靈源　、相傳興晏國師在此說道時、因嫌橋下的水流響聲、曾喝一聲、登時泉水乾涸、所以後人沿稱為『喝水巖』當然這不過是一種妄　、不足憑信也、從這裏往高、有一條滿地落　的山巖、夾道可以通到朱子祠，在未到朱子祠的中途、須經過一間廟堂、這裏邊有一方水潭、潭泉下而裝着轆轤似的水輪、隔數分鐘、輪週圍的水甄流　時、水輪　　動一點、因而牽動鐵錘、把鐘『鐺』的打了下、據說喝水巖的泉　、　興晏國師喝乾了以　、卽改流於此、　實喝水　最幽勝的所在、還在下面、只須下行石磴數十級、那呈現在眼前的、是兩旁壁立的高巖和重重的密林、靠着中間枝葉掩庇之、有一艘石頭做的畫舫、離畫舫不遠、還有一只噴水機、在不斷地噴出那匹鍊似的水珠、站在這裏、聽一會枯靜滴瀝的水聲、無異置身在一個世外的洞天裏、</p>
<p>遊完了喝水巖、接着便順道去看放生園、化身窰、羅漢台、海會塔、羅漢　、太乙洞等　脚剛踏到放生園的門口、一陣牲畜的臭味、直往鼻子裏薰、薰得幾乎氣都透不過來、這園是一間周園二層建築物、中間是一塊長方形的天　、樓底全用木　圍着、用以豢養被放生的禽畜、從木格縫裏望進去、　不多沒有一　是　凈的、食料和屎尿都滿　滿了地面、那邊白猪的圍欄裏更是滿地狼藉、白毛幾乎發黑色、依我看來、這裏禽畜雖然免了死刑、却無異換了一個無期徒刑，我想、『有緣時』、僧人無妨去參觀各地的動物園、學點管理的方法、不然的話、豈不失了放生的眞正意義、</p>
<p>羅漢台，化身　、和海會塔三處都沒有什麼可觀、騙漢台好像一塊基地、　是羅漢說法之處、化身客宛似一只警察的站崗亭、窰前有廣　一方、預備給人站在此看火葬的、焚化後的屍灰、便埋存在海會塔、該塔據脫是宋大觀三年　建的、距今已歷八百餘年、估計其中埋存僧尼等的屍灰、當不下萬具、</p>
<p>從海會塔到羅漢跡、僅跨過一條大路、走不遠再穿過一處滿長莠草的農道、便見幾株錯縱的矮樹、臨風　曳着、婆娑的樹影、正橫射在一塊灰黯色的山巖上、這裏便深深印着三個比常人稍大的足跡、也和普陀山『觀音跳』那裏的足印比較、彷彿又小一些、　豈羅漢不如觀音來得高大、可見這都是後人社造來迷惑無知人民的、隨着脚跡的方向躍　而上、可見到另一塊廣巖、巖頂平坦、長寬各三四丈、可容酒宴數席、</p>

<h3>女子籃球爭霸戰　今宵梅芳遇培道　勝則穩得錦標且看誰家女兒好福氣　好戲難得幾回看請早到塲</h3>
<p>（本專訊）憲開　魄冷、室狹熱潮高、在今脊、如到靑年會去、定然會看到如此這般的詩情畫意、</p>
<p>多事化為無事的女子籃球聯賽、今夕便是解决錦標的最後關頭、什梅芳固想重圓好夢（去届冠軍為梅芳所得）、在培道亦想締結良綠、故值此擇主佳期、且看誰家女兒好福氣、</p>
<p>梅芳、培道、在比賽經過、均未嘗失敗、白璧無瑕、端的是彼此玉　功績多、</p>
<p>這番相逢、乃爭第一、有卿無我、何等重要、寄語迷民、切莫辜負今宵、</p>
<p>梅芳三鋒、最得人愛的演出是三角輪週進攻法、够快　、够聯絡，任何守將、遇之頭痛、加以葉美蓮的反手投籃、盧慧嫻的側身吊射、都獨具一種卓絕作風、未悉培道三衛、如何應付、</p>
<p>培道的許英華、劉突隱、亦是前線女傑、妙手天成、相信也會攬得梅芳後方、滿城風雨、</p>
<p>說到全隊的合作工夫、梅芳似好一點、不過、在一幕極重要的比賽　、尙須看各員演出的態度是否反常、而後可以定其成敗、因為、有時過於興奮，反為累事、</p>
<p>劉倩影是梅芳舊人、是培道後方台柱、故雖久離娘家、　然孰悉內情、莫謂香火緣深、他便讓個情面、須知道、今乃各事其主也、</p>
<p>梅芳的伍煥英、亦够兇够辣、雖然巾幗、不讓鬚眉、坐鎭禁城、素誇猿捷、如此好戲、難得　回看、請早到場、免致閉門不納、還有自場思思對港大、是個小節目、沒什麽可說、依我看來、港大定然贏仗、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>李碩友有翼難飛　昨被判本年內取銷賽足球資格　至明年一月一日始能重着戎衣</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）本年元旦、曾有一幕國人互爭特別別銀牌準决賽權之足球惡戰、　後殊令人興不快之感、想曾目擊其事者、尙能約略憶及之也、在當日該慕劇賽之中、南華華先獲兩球後、林德譜與許竟成相觸而德譜右足受重塲、雖仍勉强應戰、然終全場乃跑步不籃矣、其後雙方均有傾跌微創之事、及賽成二對二和局、照例加賽二十分鐘再决雌雄後、各球員因　賽過步、又多有患抽蓄者、至最不幸之事、厥為李碩友與對始瓚爭球時、李突跳躍飛踢、情形緊張、裁判　九皋秉正足球規律賦予權、判令李氏出塲、不許再賽、</p>
<p>按諸足球定律、則球塲之事、當裁判者例應詳細向該管機關報告、凡有糾紛、俱撥交非常事宜小組委員判斷曲直者也、故事後葉裁判卽將判令李碩友離　之理由、向足球總會報告、理由為「危險之踢出」總會據　後、卽撥交非常事宜小組委員會辦理、查該小組委員會曾於前星期五提訊一次、但其時　因裁判葉　皋抱採薪之憂，未能出　指證、故令押候、直至昨日、乃再傳李碩友到訊，側聞當時李雖不認為有意故犯、但小組委員認為李確有危險踢出之行為、且細查紀錄册，則李於前届曾受警告、今為冉犯、故重判由犯規之日起、取銷比賽資格一年、直至明年一月一日、而後能再報册請重行出賽、</p>
<p>香本港每届足球賽會、類多球員被判離塲之糾紛而糾紛之多、尤以一九三六年至三七年之一屆為甚、但前屆（一九三七至三八）則甲組球員、絕未有被判停止賽球者、人均視為本港足球轉好之一種佳　、不謂一入本屆、先則有士葛隊之法蘭明、在九龍球場因揮拳被判離塲而被罰、次又有米杜息右內鋒確尼、因揮拳毆李國威亦被利離塲而卒停賽兩星期、然　二人之　　尙　、朱有如今第三個被判離塲者被罰之舉也、李碩　脚法疾捷　辣，為今不可多得之左萬才，尙望其經此次之敎訓後、必更發　為雄、不獨多研球　、戒除多盤、尤須習作惟踢球是務之賽球法、則後此不難獲美譽而有光明之前途、對此事　毋灰進取之心也、（球場舊侶）</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……冒牌小貴族</p>
<p>Lord　Jeff</p>
<p>是一部富有敎育意味、同時曾使每一為人父母的、和一般孩童靑年們、感覺到絕大興趣的片子、</p>
<p>弗萊第巴塞　繆、嘗在「塊肉餘生記」中、感動過每一個　衆的童星、在這里他　一個給教養壞了的孤兒、受一對狡黜的騙棍的利用、訓練他胃稱某一貴族的兒子、四出行騙、後被捕、送入一所犯罪頭童學校、在那里被迫鍊習一些航海的技術、故事就是叙述他和一班與他問類的同學們的生活、同學之一，是由粗率輕快的童星麥蓋郎尼扮演、他在學校中已做　下級軍官、　冒牌小　族、在一次私逃的時候、給他捕回、後來却成好友</p>
<p>我們還記得這兩個星童，嘗。「怒海　生」一度合作、雖則他們所表現的性格迥然不同、但是很有相形益彰的功效是一對極好的搭當、現在他們的年齡已足稍徽長大、而演技也跟着更為成熟、特別是對於年輕人的性格這一點、更是表現得活神活現、加上一個有趣的故事、和孩童們眞摯熱誠敢的　演作、更充實了本片的內容</p>
<p>皇后平安……漁船戰血</p>
<p>Soawu　of　North</p>
<p>一部由文學名著改編的電影、描寫美國北部邊境、北冰洋上阿拉士加半島、島上　民的生活、那裏大量「三文魚」的出產地、但以捕魚謀生的漁民們、却須以絕大的努力去戰勝一切天然為人　的困難、像飄浮海面的冰山、漁賊的猖狂等、來維持他們的利益、在他們充滿着悲歡憎愛的生活中、有着不少動人心腸的故事了</p>
<p>本片就是叙述兩個好友、因為漁利的衝突、一個與漁賊合作、一個站在漁民自衛團方面、好友變成了仇家、同時在他們背後有着深愛他們的女子、束手無策的、眼看他們互相鬥　、及後那跟海賊台作的、終於受傷而悔悟、故意把賊船撞沉在冰山之下、與漁賊同歸於盡、犧牲自己、玉成愛友、作為本片的高潮點、</p>
<p>本片的攝影技術、活潑巧妙、還有幾個印第安人祭儀典禮的鏡頭、在我們看來、是充滿着神秘的意味的、同時本片擁有五個　星、主演的有喬治賴甫晚、亨利方　、和桃露珊拉摩、并由愛金譚密洛天，約翰巴里穆亞等合　、情節的編排、使每人都有儘量發揮藝術天才的機會、導演亨利夏桑活、嘗導演過「松嶺恩仇記」和「抗敵英魂」等片、對於本片的情節與及高潮點的處理、很有　縱親衆情緒的力量、</p>
<p>東方……小霸王</p>
<p>Lfttle　Tough　Guy</p>
<p>就是一窮　陋巷」裏的一輩小明星、本片內容與前者異曲同工、是一張很好的敎育影片、　出都很努力、</p>
<p>大華……泰山復仇</p>
<p>Tarzan's　Revenge</p>
<p>故事半庸、述一泣探險家欲捕白　深入蠻夷、蠻王串通土人、欲擄白種女人、幸泰山力救、後白女竟因熱戀泰山、不復返去、</p>
<p>淀出絕無驚人之處、遠不及　之「泰山情侶」主角格蘭馬立斯及依蓮諾霍姆、</p>
<p>景星……風流世家</p>
<p>Anthony　Adverse</p>
<p>弗立特馬區主　、</p>
<p>中央……情大血淚</p>
<p>國語片</p>
<p>是以　琛的原著改編、記得聯華公司打著「復興國產電影」旗幟的時候、曾攝成默片名一戀愛與義務一、這次由新華公司　成聲片、仍出下萬蒼導演、口以說是駕輕就　、男主角仍由金燄担任，福女主角及　餘的配角是　外由袁美雲及梅熹等替代了、</p>
<p>故事簡單一句話說來、就是　寫個在封建社會裏屢　掙日而最後終以自我犧牲為了結一生的女性、在演出上、可以說是滿　的作品了、楊乃凡和李祖　戀愛的許多戲、是　簡潔風　，楊私奔後、李到處碰壁、而最後死亡、　步步進逼的情緒、把握得很強固、就是那　『可愛的母親』歌劇、內為太長而破壞了全劇的情緒、金燄、袁美雲、海熹　出都不差、</p>
<p>新世界……春情烈火</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>此片叙述一大飯店內之黑幕、千奇百怪的社會動想、表露社會的畸形發展、看了有莫大之感觸、此片為正義公司之第一次出。由　星鄺山笑及陳雲裳主演、</p>

<h3>怎樣選擇題材</h3>
<p>— 子淸</p>
<p>一般說來，我們喜歡寫寫文章的人們，每逢提起筆來的時候，總感覺得沒有故專寫，不知從何處下筆的好：　句話說，也就是找不着相當能　的『題材』。</p>
<p>是的，一篇著作的有價值與否，對于描寫的對象——題材——是有密切的關係的，它可以使人看了或描寫了後，有一種深刻的共鳴，好　所寫的故事，完全是讀者自身的故事那般親切，這種功能，就是　『題材』的如何選擇了。那未，『怎樣棟擇選題材』，這個問題，就應該而且必須要　在每個作者之前了，</p>
<p>「選擇題材」這個問題的提出，首先我認為要了解的，就是要知道時代與環壞的變韌性。比如在目前的抗戰時　、我們要寫的題材，就不能脫離對「抗戰」有利益的各種生活描寫，否則就是把它登載出來，給讀者有起來，就等于一堆廢紙，使讀者不能深刻的意味到，甚至叫人討厭，假使描寫點對抗戰有關係的故事，如前線軍人的生活，愛國青年男女活躍於各地的救護與宣傳工作，或後方及淪咯區域的難是的遭遇，和×人各種毒辣的殘殺掠奪的寫眞。這些生生的題材，我們只要好好的把它應用起來，就能使一般讀者得到「眞實感」並深刻的同情的同鳴，甚至於振奮讀者，使之參加各項對「抗戰』有利的工作，所以說，一篇要使人深刻意味到的著作，首先我們就要注意到它的題是否合乎時代性。</p>
<p>其次我們要想到的，就是不忘記故事的「眞實性」。因為僅僅只在合乎時代這個抽象的意識下：假使不好好地來測量一下題材的眞實性與否，這也不能增加　作品的價值，比如要描寫難民所裏的難民，如果沒有體驗到難民生活的眞實性，僅僅從第三者或各方面得來的片段的消息，而自己提起筆來七拚八湊　寫成一篇，這簡直是笑話，對事實就沒有絲毫影響。所以說，要選擇題材，也不得不汪意到它的眞實性，</p>
<p>最後，就要注意怎樣去組織這個題材。因為的客觀事實，反映到主觀的意識上來，還是一片片的零碎的故事，要把它聯成一個有系統的故事，這不得不法組織它們一下，使它們合乎科學化，使讀者看了能得到深刻的印象，而又不多費時間。</p>
<p>敬愛的寫作者們，我提出　個問題，希望會成你們寫作時的參考。</p>
<h3>「繁榮政策」</h3>
<p>— 桑子</p>
<p>據各方報道：「　　」早期帶給我們的文化，是：　　掠，××，××；其目的在求「新秩序」之建立，所以纔拿這種大和魂的精神，來儘量的破壞我們的「舊」的一切，然而結果，他們却大失所望，「瘦滿目，腥羶遍地」的「新秩序」果眞給他們造成了，但同時也喪失了大量　　　　及的對象，這是遠反他們原來所要求的現象，他們當然不甘願有這現象的存在，於是而有次期的「剛柔並施」政葉的實行。</p>
<p>所謂「剛」的政策，依舊是那舊的一套：燒，刦，×，×：不過為要顧到『柔』的方面，施展的手段較前似乎稍會『文明』此罷了。至於所謂『柔』的政策，那簡直是在那裏出把戲，自騙騙人：但是在他們卵翼下的一般『新賣』，却拿來作為宣傳『王道樂土』的根據。當然，剛柔並施的結果，他們曾經收相當的成效，但不多時，他們顯然又失敗了，不僅那班所謂『莠民』未嘗上鈞，即連一班所謂『良民』，也漸漸的明白他們的作用了。他們也自知所施的懷政策內容的不充實，所以不能得『民心』收實利，於是便又花樣翻新，以『繁榮政策』來輔助懷柔政策的推進。</p>
<p>繁榮政策的方針，是廣設「士膏店」，『俱樂郎」和「妓院」他們以繁榮市面，增加稅收的理由來唆使他們的爪牙　事推行，那般「新貴」因有「抽水」可撈，當然拼命工作，所以這一政策，已有滿　的『成績』，他們因此很快樂，認為這不但可以獲得鉅量的財貨，挽救他們的貧困，而且還可以造成『繁榮』的『新秩序」，誇　世人。</p>
<p>上海租界人丁興旺，財源茂盛，他們看着分外眼紅，然而因為情形特殊，未便挿足，於是　得在滬西一角施展他　的繁榮政策，引誘一般居民，每日向他們繳納「繁榮』費，而最近又蔓延到虹口和浦東了。</p>
<p>上海的四周，現在已被這損　我們民族的體力，消沉我們民族的意志，和毀滅我們民埃的通德的繫榮政策所包圍了，一般居住上海的人應該認淸瓖境，節持氣脈，如果死在繁榮政策下，豈獨對不起組宗，也對不起自身。</p>
<h3>誘惑</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>在　了色的心靈上，是不容易冉生出光彩來的；如果會，那就是別人染上去的顏色：黑的，紅的，黃的…</p>
<p>染色的筆　就是誘惑。握住染色筆桿的是一羣長髮的魔鬼。</p>
<p>第一位，誘惑的魔鬼，也就是誘惑的天使，出現了。　波特蘭爾（C.　Baudelaire）脫的那樣：「他身　的曲線具有古代伯考斯的那種柔美；他大而惺忪的眼睛，帶着黑而離迷的光澤，如同　雨的紫　蘭；他半啓的嘴唇，如同一架發出濃　的熱爐』。他來了，來到人間，解開腰裏的一根帶，一條燦爛的蛇，放在人們的腦究上，他，又輕輕的呼出一口　氣，好像說：「我是色情的鬼，你們快在我吐出的香霧中睡下來吧」——於是，許多人仆在地上。</p>
<p>接着，一道金色的光亮，先在遠處　了一閃，慢慢的滾過來。呀，是一個肥胖的魔鬼，他用堅硬的拳頭，敲着大肚子，發出一聲悠長的，鏗鏘的聲音；這聲音　開去，消滅在無數人隱約的呻呤中；他又　出了尖牙，　瘋狂的，大笑起來，像酒醉後發出的痴笑一樣；忽然，他冉敲着大肚子，讓擊出的聲音告訴人們：「我的金錢，能够給你們任可東西，你們要嗎？請跪在我的脚下吧。」——於是，許多人仆在地上。</p>
<p>最後，又是一位妖精來臨了。</p>
<p>他有一具大的號筒，他能把你的名字放在號筒裏呌喊，讓全世界每一個角落裏都聽得見。他有魁　的身體，高傲的眼珠，和看不見摸不着的嘴：他有迷人的魅力會把你薰得你玻璃鏡子那樣平祖。可是，這面玻璃鏡却要另外一盞燈的照射纔能發亮；這另外一盞燈呢，正在他手中。</p>
<p>地球面積不小。是的。不過他手裏的燈只有一道光。他高高的托它　起，搖着幌着，逗着你的心，撥着你的　骨，　道：「你要名譽嗎？如果要，那末把　子橫在我面前，整個的身體倒在玻璃上吧——於是　多人仆在地上。</p>
<p>誘惑的魔鬼，也就是誘惑的天使，在每一塊地方跨着步子。他那　着的衣襟拂着人們靈魂，他更有甜的唾沐，灑在人們臉上：那是　，是醉人的酒。人醉了，還硬　作淸醒的模樣，强　着：「我沒有醉—」是嗎，魔鬼笑了，哈哈，人們中計了。色情的鬼　着腰帶：金錢的鬼魔敲着肚子；名譽的鬼閃着燈光；人們都服貼的跪着。</p>
<p>一陣風；一道光，吹不散迷霧，照不亮黑暗。人間是充滿着誘惑的，永遠，永遠……</p>
<h3>未價的血債</h3>
<p>— 杜文慧</p>
<p>這是仲夏之尾時六月。荔枝鮮紅的臉正閃耀在枝頭的季節，在這南國的古城！廣州正在×機不斷的大轟炸之下變成一個死寂之都了。</p>
<p>不論是黎明還是黃昏，不論是白天還是黑夜，恐怖悽厲的警報　遠在哀鳴着。人們的心情也跟着一陣陣的嗚嗚的聲在顫抖着驚惶着，四面八方　奔跑着，然而警報一解除的時候，人們還是很擁擠地跑在路上，商店還開着店門做生意。人們似乎在幾個月　矗炸生活中獲得了一　鎭靜堅貞的經驗似的。我常在警報的時候，無目的地走在角上，或是站在街頭看有那些過路的人的面色　着那些過路人的話語，他們都有一顆交感共鳴的對×人憤恨的心，他們都有一個嚴肅忍耐的臉色，有些時也聽見「丢那媽，又來了，死日本仔」底粗俗的內心洩露出來的咒語，人們很多都逃了，剩下來的人都是凖備着一死而不忍離開的。</p>
<p>一個早晨，天空沒有一絲陽光，祗有那陰鬱的灰蒼色的雲塊，密密的塞滿了天際。這悲愁色調彷彿是象徵着這都市的命運，彷　是一件喪衣似的披在那白雲山頭，披在混黃滔滔的珠江流水，披在那一望無際塗着防空色的房子，披在每個有經驗市民底心眼裏，這又是×機要來光顧的王道吉日了，</p>
<p>在第一次警報之後，我便穿了衣服在永漢路上走着。街道上的人們正在熙來擴往，東奔西突。一陣陣　的皮鞋履聲，好像這都市裏每個　難人的跳動的心情。尤其是那些女人們；拖老　幼，面如土色的叫喊着。</p>
<p>「阿猪這兒來呀—婆婆呢？唉！你快點來這兒啊」—她們成羣結隊，躱進哥倫布餐室騎樓下的沙包裏。人是擁擠的。我　到那兒時，沒有辦法走得過，那些人們都很自私地，不肯退讓一寸的地方。死是人們最害怕的呀！尤其是在這×機轟炸下的死；在這當兒，我充份看出人類底自私和怕死的天性。小孩子的哭聲在喧鬧著。人們在互相咒罵著。恐怖的氣息已經在這幫人們自己做號出來了。</p>
<p>當我走進文明路一間飯店時。×機已衝進市空了。它飛得很低，高射砲已不發主效力。高射機關槍也射不到。灰雲低壓着市空；×機摩托的軋軋和從遠處『轟轟」的爆炸聲，已振動着人們的耳鼓。警察壯丁隊和士兵們來馬路維持着秩序。</p>

<h3>納粹的電影也在宣傳和平了</h3>
<p>— 音員</p>
<p>自一九三三年起，德國的電影事業便陷入進退維谷的境地。在國內放映的影片不得不為第三德意志歌功頌德，傳佈國家社會主義的精神。影片公司要賺錢，非把影片推銷出國不可，但是許多國家都反對國社主義的觀念，一九三一年，德國輸出的影片總值五于九百馬克，到一九三七年，「消滅影業破壞份子」之後，輸出影片傳值七百二十萬馬克，國社主義的影業淸談，不用說，德國的影片的水準也低落了。</p>
<p>德國影片水準低落的主因之一，是因為最優秀的製片家，導演，創作家，和明星的遭驅逐出國，不可勝計，最前進的喜劇明星格倫蓬，以及其他幾個奧國的影片藝術家被押禁在集中營裏。</p>
<p>德國所攝　的並非全是民族主義和軍國主義的影片，數年前、德國創攝短歌劇影片，，自一力三三年起，便有攝　短歌舞影片之風，　人欣茲　把這種影片的水凖提高起來，德國在新政權統治下曾攝製可愛的音樂戲片是不能否認的，可是，欣茲爾現在也離開了德國而上好萊塢了，德國　片的不健全，第二個原因是政治檢查，官方的限制，越來超多，現在德國電影的命令和查禁之多，竟至沒有人完全知悉。</p>
<p>第三個原因實在是由於德國「納粹」黨人無理取　所造成的壞結果。德國影片首先創造以文學的，心理的和社會的材為製片的持質，然而現在這種影片也不能攝製了。第三德意志不得談及嚴重的社會問題，以心理上的題材，也只准在嚴格限制之內攝製。</p>
<p>今日德國的電影裏，以及許多小晚和短篇故事裏，都有殘忍的軍國主義的精神侵入了。但也並不是每部影片都有公開的政治宣傳，烏發，　　士，都拉，翻巴伐利亞各攝影場還拍攝偵探和冒險故事的影片，但可以觀察到一種奇怪的現象，便是這種影片的劇情都以他國為背景，暗殺，竊盜，暴虐，無憐憫心的惡棍，都是使人激動的劇情裏所不可缺少的。但官方法令說是德國不再有這種暗　等事情存在，總算幸遝。製片商可以用英法美或其他國家來做背景，而攝製這種影片例如預定一九三九年攝製的，就有用阿拉新加，智利，菲洲，挪威，和美國作背景的許多影片。只有日本和意大利，才不把它們用做為非作歹的背景和惡棍的集居地，關於影片一節，日和德國有密切的合作，由德人芬克博士導演的『武士道之女』一片，便是日德聯合攝製的第一片。德國到處都放映日本影片，例如勞斯魯　演的「日本之力量」，和德。聯合影片社攝製的「魔手」等等。</p>
<p>德政府且逐漸誘勸日本滅少外國影片的輸入，傳多映德意影片，德意亦合作攝製影片，預定明年將合攝巨片三部，國社主義的宣傳影片，在德國到處放映，還豫備拍攝一部名叫「和平之劍」的影片，內容是描寫「其他國家裏布　什維克的階級國爭導成流血的擾亂，「另一方面則描寫」德國為和平而努力，「這樣想一手掩盡天下人耳目的傑作，其　實興否，只有天知道了！</p>

<h3>On the Premise of Soviet Military Assistance to China</h3>
<p>The Japanese newspapers in Hong Kong have carried a Chongqing dispatch stating that President Sun Zhe-sheng, at a reception for cultural figures, discussed three conditions for Soviet military assistance to China. This analysis is very correct and scientifically sound, and deserves the attention of the general public. Today, this newspaper publishes the full text of President Sun's speech and elaborates on it. I remember that in May and June of last year, the issue of Soviet military intervention caused a major debate in Wuhan's cultural circles due to a record in the "Three-Day Anti-Japanese War Journal." However, in our view, the core of this issue lies in the objective conditions of the world, not in the subjective conditions of the Soviet Union. To determine whether the Soviet Union will send troops to aid China, or when it will send troops, we should examine whether the objective situation for Soviet military intervention has matured. Therefore, President Sun's judgment of the conditions is more precise and theoretically sound than any of the arguments made by any faction in the previous debate in Wuhan's cultural circles.</p>
<p>Speaking of the subjective conditions for Soviet military assistance to China, they are very mature, because the solid foundation of the Soviet socialist state and the development of Japanese aggression are in a situation of incompatibility. This is not only because of the general saying "Soviet-Japanese historical enmity," but the main reason lies in the existence of the dominant contradiction between the two systems. The dominant contradiction between the Soviet and Japanese systems is not only manifested in the direct struggle between the two countries, but also indirectly in their policies towards China. The Japanese rulers not only severely suppressed the so-called "communist ideas from the Soviet Union" that they feared within their own country, but also attached the excuse of "preventing the spread of communist ideas" to their aggression against China. The Japanese aggressors not only wanted to annex all of China, but also wanted to "expedition" Siberia again. A few years ago, a Japanese military officer criticized the Japanese army authorities for failing to occupy Siberia when the Soviet Union's eastern military construction was not completed during the "September 18th Incident," resulting in the growth of Soviet power in the Far East. This criticism caused a major wave in the Japanese military and political circles. Even now, many Japanese aggressors are still practicing this broken dream, which shows how deeply ingrained the prejudice of Japanese aggressors against the existence of Soviet power in the East is. The Soviet government and people are well aware of this and feel it most deeply. At the same time, the survival of China has a decisive impact on the development of Soviet power in the East, so the subjective conditions for Soviet military assistance to China are absolutely not a problem.</p>
<p>The center of the question of Soviet military assistance to China lies in whether the objective conditions are met, and among many objective conditions, the most important is "the joint understanding and action of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and the Soviet Union to jointly sanction violence." (as President Sun said) Now, this condition is gradually maturing, and the most important key lies in the United States. The conflict between the United States and Japan has not only escalated to hand-to-hand combat because Japan's actions have violated the principles of the "Nine-Power Treaty," but recently, the German-Japanese conspiracy to seize the interests of Central and South America has caused the United States to feel deeply threatened. Therefore, President Roosevelt's desire to implement economic sanctions against Japan has progressed from hoping for congressional support to demanding it. Not only has the United States government lent China huge loans and insisted on maintaining the stability of the legal currency, a strong link in the Chinese war of resistance, but the United States Congress is also discussing amending the Neutrality Act to practically participate in the world, especially the Pacific, struggle. If the United States can resolve to actively sanction Japan, then the United Kingdom and France will naturally not be a problem. Because the United Kingdom's position in the Far East has undergone tremendous changes with Japan's invasion of South China, not only have the United Kingdom's interests in China been completely lost, but also the Eastern colonies of both the United Kingdom and France have been greatly threatened. Furthermore, Japan's gaining power in the East indirectly helps its accomplices Germany and Italy to exert pressure on the United Kingdom and France in Europe. The general public and public opinion circles in the United Kingdom and France are also actively demanding that the government sanction Japan, so no matter how the British and French governments want to negotiate with Germany and Italy to seek temporary compromise, their efforts to stop Japan's rampant aggression will not be stranded. When the concerted action of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France matures, the Soviet Union will further increase the greater power of this concerted action.</p>
<p>Recently, the conditions for Japan to force the Soviet Union to take more active action against Japan have been gradually expanding due to the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet, with further collusion between the military and the right-wing fascists. Previously, the Japanese Vice Minister of the Army, Tojo, made a statement to munitions merchants about simultaneously fighting against China and the Soviet Union. Although it was a threatening gesture at the time, there is a great possibility that the gesture will turn into a real performance. Although Tojo was transferred away due to the dissatisfaction of the financial circles, and Internal Affairs Minister Matsuki also stepped down at the same time as Finance Minister Ikeda because he revealed his edge too much, it can be predicted that the Hiranuma Cabinet will use greater conspiracies to deceive the Japanese people, political parties, and even some financial magnates in the future. The huge military budget bill and the implementation bill of the General Mobilization Law must be passed by the parliament, and the methods of deception will be more innovative and endless. The internal contradictions of Japanese aggression can only be temporarily alleviated by shifting the attention of the whole country to foreign problems. The Japanese rulers have been using this trick since the "September 18th" incident. In the future, expanding the incident and reviewing the "playing with fire" incident at Changkufeng will naturally be one of the future tricks. Japanese aggressors are not only actively planning to attack the Northwest, but are also further colluding with their accomplice Germany to take the approach of pincer attacks from the East and West. In this situation, the Soviet Union will naturally have to actively defend itself, change from defense to offense, "prepare to strike any aggressor with two or three times more force," and "a greater blow than Changkufeng." The Soviet Union has resolved to recover forty military fishing zones in the Far East, while Japan insists on the provisions of the Treaty of Portsmouth. Then, the conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan will deepen. If the aggressors want to resolve the conflict by force, then the condition of "Japan advancing to attack Soviet territory" as stated by President Sun will mature, and Soviet military assistance to China will be fully realized.</p>
<p>However, there is an even more important premise for Soviet military assistance to China, which is that China itself must resist to the end. The Soviet Union's desire to cooperate with China to defeat the common enemy, Japanese aggression, is sincere and unquestionable. As President Sun said, the Soviet side had already proposed to China to sign a "Mutual Assistance Agreement," which shows its determination. During the highest tide of the first phase of the war of resistance, the Xuzhou campaign, the Soviet Union struck the "fire players" at Changkufeng, and then the Soviet-Japanese war ended because wavering elements in the war of resistance proposed some German-Italian diplomatic routes at the People's Political Council. These all prove the correlation between our war of resistance and Soviet military assistance to China. Since the war of resistance entered the second phase, several top-level meetings of senior generals, especially the generals' meeting recently convened by Chairman Chiang in the Northwest, have decided on many proposals to promote closer cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The establishment of some kind of committee rumored outside is a comprehensive manifestation of this trend. Soviet military assistance to China is only waiting for the objective conditions to mature more concretely. Our subjective efforts are the most important link.</p>
<h3>A Week in World Trends</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From January 7th to 13th, Year 28</p>
<p>Light beckons us!</p>
<p>Victory beckons us!</p>
<p>This is the conclusion we reached in our review of the first week of current events in the New Year. Now it is the second week. This week, whether viewed from a global perspective or from the perspective of China, has been even more lively. This liveliness still tells us that the whole world is moving towards the light, and China has already embarked on the road to victory. Although there are still many obstacles ahead of us, they cannot scare us away.</p>
<p>The Development of the Eradication of Traitors Movement</p>
<p>The first thing to report is the development of our nationwide traitor eradication movement. Because in the past 18 months of the War of Resistance, due to the existence of Chinese traitors and spies of Japan, our front-line soldiers and compatriots in various places have encountered countless shocking unjust deaths and damages. If we do not thoroughly cleanse them today, the future will be even more unthinkable. After Wang Zhaoming's collusion with the enemy, surrender, and betrayal of the country was exposed, everyone recognized that those who usually advocated peace, opposed communism, and admired Germany were completely on the path of becoming traitors. From then on, Japanese spies and traitors could not find partners in our government or on our anti-Japanese front lines. This is great fortune within our misfortune. However, after the exposure of this plot by the traitors, they are still struggling in their last throes. A small number of corrupt and conservative elements, blind elements who doubt the outcome of the war, and the propaganda organs privately run by Wang and other pro-Japanese elements have become the weapons of the traitors' last struggle. Therefore, this week, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Li Hanhun, and others repeatedly telegraphed to demand the arrest of Wang for justice. The anti-Wang and traitor eradication movement, from the front-line soldiers to the people in the rear, from all sectors of Shanghai and Hong Kong to overseas Chinese, has unfolded even more enthusiastically. What should be noted now is that first, the pro-Japanese and pro-peace traitors and their tools who have committed heinous crimes should no longer be tolerated, because tolerance of traitors is a crime against the people and the country; second, we must be careful to avoid implicating the innocent. Those who were previously close to the traitors but can turn back to good are national heroes. In addition, we must especially recognize that anyone who advocates peace, truce, anti-communism, anti-Chiang, or division has actually become a special operations team for the traitors. We must be especially vigilant!</p>
<p>Great Political and Military Progress</p>
<p>The major political and military progress in our country has overwhelmed and shattered the shameless rumors of the Japanese spies, traitors, and Wang and others.</p>
<p>Taking the publicly disclosed news this week as an example, Chairman Chiang, the central responsible authorities, and leaders of various parties, political and military factions, such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Peng Dehuai, have recently held several talks, and the results have been extremely satisfactory. Such as the strengthening of central institutions, the improvement of local administrative organs, the establishment of provincial and county councils within a time limit, and the earnest implementation of the program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. This shows political progress. The rumors spread by traitors that the central government was shaken after its move from Chongqing are completely unfounded. Furthermore, the Communist Party has repeatedly called for support for Chairman Chiang, support for the National Government, support for the punitive resolutions, and the complete subordination of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to the command of the Military Commission, and the complete subordination of the administrative affairs of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to the National Government. This fact of close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party further proves that empty talk about anti-communism, anti-Eighth Route Army, and anti-Border Region only pleases the traitors. In addition, Chairman Chiang personally presided over two important military conferences in the Southwest and Northwest, and the results have led to new measures for the overall War of Resistance military affairs. The renaming of the occupied areas as guerrilla areas and the establishment and advancement of a large number of fresh troops to the Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi special war zones are the most obvious manifestations. Following the appointment of Bai Chongxi, Zhu Shaoliang, and Jiang Dingwen to respectively command the military affairs in the Southwest and Northwest, Chen Jicheng, the education director of the Central Military Academy, has now been appointed as the director of the New Soldier Training Office to train 2.2 million soldiers in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces for the purpose of replenishing various armies and recovering lost territory. According to the new strategy, it is decided to deploy the national military force so that "one-third goes deep behind enemy lines, one-third guards key positions on the front lines, and the rest is prepared for training and drawing troops." This military progress is something that the traitors dare not face squarely!</p>
<p>The Struggle for Two Rear Areas</p>
<p>In line with the new needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, it has been decided that we should intensify the struggle to develop two rear areas. On the one hand, we must accelerate the construction of our own rear area and quickly complete all preparations for the future counter-offensive and national reconstruction. On the other hand, we must intensify the struggle for the development of the rear area behind enemy lines. "Go to the enemy's side to fight for sovereignty and land!" This is not only a head-on blow to the generally blind anti-communist elements, but should also become an unshakable strategic guideline. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have been doing this for a long time and have achieved good results. According to Peng Dehuai, who left Chongqing a few days ago to return to his defense zone, the Eighth Route Army alone killed one-fifth of the Japanese troops in the three provinces of Chahar, Hebei, and Shanxi in the past year, captured 9,100 rifles, 19 artillery pieces, 30 small mortars, and 500 machine guns, and killed three Japanese brigade and regimental commanders. Moreover, now "politics is more important than military affairs, the rear area is more important than the front line, the people are more important than the soldiers, guerrilla warfare is more important than positional warfare, and propaganda is more important than organization." This is not only the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party, but also has been clearly determined by the central supreme military authorities as the basic strategic guideline for the future. The Military Commission has established a special agency to concentrate the strength of the party, government, and military to jointly deal with the political offensive of the Japanese army and use it to destroy the organizations of Wang Jingwei and puppets. As for the development of the struggle in our own rear area, in addition to clarifying politics, mobilizing the people, and training new soldiers, Chairman Chiang and the military and political authorities of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou have repeatedly held meetings to discuss and decide to actively engage in economic development and construction work, such as the construction of heavy industry and the development of transportation networks. This kind of news, like reports from the front line, is flying in like snowflakes, symbolizing the bright and happy future of the new China!</p>
<p>A Week of Great Victories in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Along with the political and military progress and the development of the struggle in the two rear areas, the situation of the War of Resistance this week has begun to improve unprecedentedly. What is particularly noteworthy is the great victory on the Shanxi front. Since the end of December, the Japanese army, in coordination with the Near Guards and Wang Zhaoming's betrayal, launched a large-scale five-pronged offensive in the "Shanxi Great Sweep," hoping to take the opportunity to strengthen their "anti-communist" propaganda, and also to test our strength or take advantage of our unpreparedness to launch a major battle in northern Shanxi. However, in the past two weeks, we first seized the opportunity to defeat the Japanese army and recaptured Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, Puxian, and other important places in the Shanxi war zone. One-tenth of the Japanese army was killed in action, and countless others were wounded, scattered, and captured. This victory proves the invincibility of the Northwest Anti-Japanese forces under the leadership of the consolidated united front, and further proves that the so-called "anti-communist" military force of the Japanese traitors is becoming increasingly weak. In addition, the battles in various guerrilla areas have gradually developed. The main ones are: our army in Jiangbei recovered Liyang, the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu has been gradually cleared, our army in Jiangnan besieged Hangzhou, and the Japanese army on the eastern front is therefore in a very embarrassed situation. In this kind of battle, not only is the front-line warfare continuing to stabilize in Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, etc., but also there is a general counter-offensive in South China. Guangzhou is still under our army's encirclement, and our army in Dongjiang has taken advantage of the victory to recapture Zengcheng and rushed into Shilong. On the Xijiang front, the first step has been taken to counter-attack Zhaoqing by attacking to stop the attacks, and the first step has been successful. What is particularly worth reporting in passing is that the mechanization equipment of our army is developing universally, and the air force has new supplements and expansions. On the other hand, the Japanese army is at a loss. We are extremely optimistic about the future war.</p>
<p>Prospects for the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>However, we must not overemphasize these optimistic factors. We should also be vigilant at the same time: there are still many obstacles and traps in the future of our bright victory. To ensure that the above-mentioned optimistic facts continue to develop, the first thing is to be vigilant and crack down on the conspiracies of the Japanese spies and traitors at any time. We must be more united, more unified, and strive for greater progress in politics, military affairs, economy, diplomacy, and the people's movement. At this moment, the Kuomintang, which is leading the whole nation in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, is about to convene the Fifth Plenary Session. This newspaper has already provided many opinions in its editorial on the tenth of this month. In particular, what the people unanimously demand is that first, the organization of the Kuomintang itself should be sound, the discipline should be more strict, and conservative elements should be rejected, and strive for progress; second, a national united front should be established to unite all parties to lead the whole nation in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and forever shatter the Japanese traitors' movement to sow discord, separate, and divide; third, the Three Principles of the People Youth League should open its doors to patriotic youth across the country, improve and enrich the organization and work of the military, and extensively and massively train youth cadres for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; fourth, greatly promote and earnestly implement the program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We firmly believe that this plenary session will definitely produce more glorious and greater results than the extraordinary plenary session last year. We dare to ask the members of the Central Committee to make special efforts, and we hope that the people of the whole country will warmly support it.</p>
<p>Japan's Serious Difficulties</p>
<p>Now, let us broaden our horizons and take a look at Japan, the enemy country! After the establishment of the Hiranuma cabinet in Japan last week, it originally wanted to renew the world's vision and slightly wash away the pain and humiliation it had suffered in China in the past year. However, the result is that the birth of the new cabinet not only failed to elicit any better criticism internationally, but the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union unanimously denounced "Japan's politics as increasingly trending towards fascist aggression, which will inevitably increase conflicts with countries of peace and justice." Even Germany and Italy, Japan's allies, not only uttered a few perfunctory words of response, but even ignored it; and it also aroused greater worries and resentment among the people of the whole country towards the rulers. The first step of the new cabinet was unable to resolve the difficulties of the General Mobilization Law and the huge budget outside of violence, and the struggle within the ruling camp of political parties, financial magnates, and military inspectors intensified. As for externally easing the opposition between the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and Japan, it is hopeless due to the inseparability of fascist aggression and Far East hegemony. A London dispatch on the 8th stated that The Observer of the United Kingdom pointed out with regard to the actual economic situation in Japan: "Anyone who knows the actual situation in Japan will not be surprised that its collapse is about to occur!" The newspaper also pointed out: "The intensified production of Japanese industry and the increased suffering of workers affect the people's energy and the quality of production. The decline of technical talents greatly reduces Japan's urgently needed import of war materials. Although the Japanese yen is nominally worth two shillings, it is only worth a few pence on the foreign market. The Japanese masses, especially the farmers, have reached a state where they cannot make a living!" As for the difficulties of the war in China, it goes without saying. General He Yingqin's report on the morning of the 9th also stated: "Our national army is getting stronger and stronger in battle, while the Japanese army is finding it difficult to quickly resolve the war, and its morale has been greatly hit. The military expenditure consumes 300 million yen per month, and the number of soldiers killed and wounded has reached 700,000 to date. The number of aircraft lost is 2,851, and the number of warships damaged is more than 580. The anti-war atmosphere in the country is expanding, and the anti-war sentiment of the combat troops is growing stronger every day." It can be seen that the Japanese army has lost confidence in victory, exposing the seriousness of its difficulties.</p>
<p>New Posture of the Aggression Group</p>
<p>Not only Japan, but also the actual situation of other fascist aggressors is the same. Their external wars of aggression not only fail to solve the economic crisis of their countries and people (because their wars are not really for the benefit of their countries, nations, and people), but also deepen the crisis in their countries and mature the conditions for revolution. Therefore, the fascist war demons cannot but intensify the launching of external wars and further collude with each other to expand the war. In the past two weeks of the New Year, the Hiranuma cabinet in Japan has clearly stated that it will further unite the "anti-communist" aggression group of Japan, Germany, and Italy. The diplomatic and financial authorities of Germany and Italy, Goering, Ribbentrop, Schacht, and Ciano, have been active everywhere, both east and west, north and south, and military intimidation has been occurring one after another. The secret agreement between Italy and Germany to conquer Europe has also been confirmed by the diplomatic community through various reports. The constant ups and downs in Hungary this week, the continuous negotiations between Germany and Poland, the unrest in Romania and Yugoslavia, and the wild dance of the claws and hooves of fascist aggressors in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and even Asia Minor fully prove the ambition of German and Italian fascist aggressors to expand the world war. If the peaceful and democratic countries do not take strong measures to resist, this ambition will inevitably develop further. The reports of the US ambassadors to the UK, Kennedy, and the US ambassador to France, Bullitt, based on certain facts in Europe, point out that this trend really deserves the attention and vigilance of all parties. However, the aggression front is not an irresistible force at the same time. On the contrary, their difficulties are increasing day by day and developing. Especially when financial oligarchs reap profits from the wars they instigate, leaving their countries and people in more serious poverty, this poverty will make the aggressors find their own precariousness; on the other hand, under the influence of the League of Nations' peaceful instigation, the broad masses of the world have gradually become aware, united, and prepared to embark on the road to their own liberation. The protest of millions of Italian farmers in southwestern France on the 9th of this month against Italy's aggression against North Africa and the movement to attack Spain is just one example that can be cited at random.</p>
<p>The Rome Talks Failed</p>
<p>The Anglo-Italian Rome talks were the implementation of a part of the plan made at the Munich Conference. After the Munich Conference, the fascist aggressors' intimidation gained "legitimate" "victory," and the position of Britain and France in Europe was greatly reduced, to the point of gradually falling into isolation. The fascist aggressors then thought of further conquering Europe, and Germany and Italy went their separate ways and fought together. Italy even attempted to use the fantasy of some British politicians to revitalize British European hegemony under the four-power cooperation, further weaken France, conquer Spain, and flex its muscles in the Mediterranean. The Rome talks were the main tool for fascist Italy to implement this ambition and the first step in its implementation. At that time, the main proposals planned for negotiation were: first, how to adjust Anglo-Italian relations; second, how to resolve the Spanish war; and third, how to ease and resolve the disputes between France and Italy; in addition, it also included economic issues and even the establishment of a four-power political axis, a new European Holy Alliance, and so on. However, on the one hand, the world, especially the people of Britain and France who love peace and democracy, have become aware, and since then, they have bravely opposed cooperation with the fascist aggressors, and on the other hand, the fact that the fascist aggressors have become more rampant after the concessions of Britain and France, and the progress calls and policies of the US government have also begun to warn the authorities of Britain and France. Therefore, the British Prime Minister held repeated cabinet meetings before going to Italy, and first sought France's intentions, and prepared not to make any more concessions. The talks began on the 12th, and the revolutionary political parties of Britain, the New Party, and the French authorities expressed their opposition to concessions under the enthusiastic movement of the domestic masses, so that the problem of France was never raised until the formal end of the talks on the 12th. Anglo-Italian relations were not really discussed, and the Spanish issue did not have any concrete results because Italy had no intention of ending its aggression. The failure of the meeting was inevitable, but Britain and France are still not thoroughly adopting a policy of compromise toward the fascist aggressors, so the future cannot be "left unresolved."</p>
<p>The Peace Front Has Developed</p>
<p>Now everyone understands that the only effective way to defend peace and eliminate war is for all peaceful and democratic countries to unite closely and implement sanctions against fascist aggressors with all their actual power and armed forces. The Second Imperialist War that existed after Hitler came to power, although limited to the national aggression and annihilation among the imperialist countries, such as Abyssinia, Austria, and Czechoslovakia; however, after the Munich Conference, the development of the war has been forced into a direct conflict between the imperialists! The aggression front and the peace front have become more clearly opposed to each other—all countries that defend democracy and peace must resolutely and firmly stand against fascist aggression and unite with each other. Moreover, the time for preparation is about to pass, and without a swift and decisive expression, they will only be swept into and sacrificed in the great fascist war. The United States was the first to stand on the front line of this great war crisis. After Roosevelt continued his great outcry against fascist aggression last week, this week he officially announced that he would station a fleet permanently in the Atlantic Ocean and actively develop naval and air combat readiness in the Pacific. Then he chose a consultative message to Congress and asked for authorization to sanction aggressive countries such as Japan and Germany. This expression from the United States could not but greatly impress Britain. Within this week, the British authorities, under the urging of progressive people and the masses across the country, began to show a more active attitude. Especially with regard to the Far East, they expressed their willingness to cooperate with the United States and other countries to intensify the steps to aid China and sanction Japan. When the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations meets tomorrow to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue, it will at least show a situation that is more favorable to us. What is particularly worth reporting is that, as the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States gradually improves, China's international position will also be more advantageous, and the Soviet Union may also provide further assistance. The conclusion of the Sino-Philippine Agreement and the Sino-Egyptian Agreement this week clearly shows that only by adhering to unity and the War of Resistance can we have a brighter and more victorious future! Our efforts are not only related to our own destiny and the destiny of the country, but even more so to the great significance of pushing the world towards the path of light! Work hard! The God of Freedom has lit the torch of victory for us!</p>

<h3>War Re-ignites in Northern Guangdong, Taiping Village Repeatedly and Fiercely Attacked, Military and Political Adjustments Lead to Brighter Prospects</h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 13th] Reliable sources confirm that our Anti-Japanese Army has been strengthened in recent months. Furthermore, with appropriate adjustments in military, political and personnel matters, the future of the War of Resistance is definitely very promising.</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 13th] Shanghai news: Yamada, the newly appointed commander of the Japanese Central China Army, originally planned to go directly from Nanjing to Hankou. However, due to the renewed tension in the eastern battlefield, he secretly inspected Shanghai and Hangzhou before proceeding to Hankou. According to Yamada's statement, he is determined to lead sixteen divisions to attack a certain key point in central China, but this is generally laughed at as insane bragging. It is already extremely difficult for the Japanese army in central China to concentrate, and the mobilization of sixteen divisions is far from easy. Moreover, in our strategic warfare, even if the Japanese have a total attack of sixteen divisions, they will only invite defeat. Even if they double their strength, we will not be afraid of them. It is reported that Yamada is a backbone member of the young officers of the Japanese army, but he lacks intelligence and military experience.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lin, 13th, 8 AM] After a lull of more than ten days, the war in Northern Guangdong has recently intensified again. It has been found that the Japanese army launched an attack on our Dakang area from Taiping Village on the 1st. The Japanese army suddenly attacked us again from Taiping Village yesterday. As of the time of the telegram, both sides are in a stalemate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th] A military authority on the Chinese side declared to the correspondent that our Supreme Commander has established two special war zones: one is the Hebei-Chahar Special War Zone, appointing Lu Zhonglin as the commander and the newly appointed chairman of the Chahar provincial government, Shi Yousan, as the deputy commander; the other is the Shandong Special War Zone, appointing the chairman of the Shandong provincial government, Kuang Honglie, as the commander. (Editor's note: This telegram is largely the same as our newspaper's special telegram on the 8th. However, according to our newspaper's special telegram, the so-called Shandong area in this telegram is actually the Lu-nan Special War Zone, and its commander and deputy commander are Qian Xuezhong and Shen Honglie, respectively.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] Military intelligence: since the 23rd of last month, three thousand Japanese troops jointly attacked Zhongyang, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi. The Japanese army in Zhongyang advanced through our Guanshang toward Shuiyou. The Japanese army in Fenyang invaded Maijiao through Duifang Jiugu. On the 3rd, they reached the Shuikou Nuanyong area. In order to lure the enemy in deeper, our army withdrew to both sides. On the evening of the 3rd, taking the Japanese by surprise, they broke into Shuikou, surrounded Nuanyong, and completely defeated the Japanese army. The remnants of the Japanese army fled north. We recovered Nuanyong Shuikou and are still gradually pursuing the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 12th] (1) Our Wang Brigade's Gao Battalion attacked the Japanese army in Qinghua Town on the night of the 9th. Arriving near the village at Zi time (11 PM-1 AM), they immediately advanced with the main force toward Nanzhuang. Our officers and soldiers bravely rushed to the Japanese positions, destroying obstacles. The Japanese were caught off guard. We used hand grenades to kill more than fifty Japanese troops and destroyed seventy or eighty utility poles and more than three hundred meters of wires. Our platoon leader, Lu Laohan, and three soldiers suffered minor injuries. (2) More than two hundred Japanese infantrymen advanced toward Mazhengtou and Congdi on the afternoon of the 9th. A detachment of our Yan Detachment engaged them and detoured to attack the flanks of the Japanese army near Wucun. The Japanese army could not withstand the attack and fled north in disarray. We killed more than a dozen Japanese troops.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Jing Le, 13th] Recently, our guerrillas have been very active near Shuoxian. A few days ago, our troops encountered more than three hundred Japanese troops near Majiazhuang. After four hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops abandoned more than fifty bodies and fled in a panic to Shuoxian. In addition, another unit of ours sabotaged eight li (approximately 2.5 miles) of the railway near the south of Shahe near Shuoxian on the evening of the 1st and destroyed the bridge. At the same time, another unit of ours damaged about seven li of the railway south of Ningwu. At present, traffic between Shuoxian and Yuanping is completely cut off.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Jing Le, 13th] The Japanese army in Taiyuan is very panicked recently. Most of the families of military and government personnel have been transported to Datong. Sandbags are piled up at the city gates and streets in preparation for an attack by our army. The Japanese army along the Datong-Puzhou railway north of Taiyuan, except for those who are necessary to guard the area, have all withdrawn south. Because the people refuse to use the puppet banknotes in northern Shanxi, the price is falling day by day, and each yuan is only worth six jiao of our border region and national currency.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 13th] After the failure of the Japanese army's attack on the Lvliang Mountains this time, they regrouped their forces in Hejin, attempting to force their way through from there. Japanese troops have continued to increase in Hejin in the past two days. Dong Yumen is still in our hands. Our army, which recovered Xiangning, has left the mountains from there and is attacking the flanks of the Japanese army, who are very panicked.</p>

The Chairman greatly encouraged him. Mr. Peng returned north by plane on the 9th and telegraphed back here, saying that he had safely arrived at a certain location on the front lines on the 12th. Just as a victory celebration rally was being held in Shanxi, Mr. Peng conveyed the Central Government's concern for the people of North China and its commendation of their dedication to resisting Japan. Morale on the front lines was greatly boosted. He also said that rallies had been held in various places in recent days, with soldiers and civilians supporting Chairman Chiang, defending the Central Government, calling for opposition to compromise, eliminating traitors, and strengthening the united front against Japan. Moreover, Peng said when he was in Chongqing that in the past year, the Group Army had eliminated one-fifth of the enemy forces in the provinces of Chahar, Hebei, and Shanxi, seizing a total of 1,900 rifles, 19 artillery pieces, 30 small mortars, and 500 machine guns, as well as a large quantity of military supplies. Enemy aircraft destroyed by burning and shot down by rifles and other means amounted to as many as 125. In addition, one enemy brigade commander and two regimental commanders were killed, and countless enemy officers and soldiers were captured, who were treated with leniency.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 13th] Railway traffic between Beiping and Tianjin resumed yesterday, but the section where the train derailed has not yet been repaired, so passengers must walk several hundred yards. Regarding the train derailment, a Japanese spokesman said it was because visibility was poor. However, foreign travelers said that the section of railway was clearly destroyed by explosives, and the collapsed bridge was also damaged, but has been repaired.</p>
<p>[Min Ge Dian Hequ, 12th] According to reliable sources from the front, after Ying Zhonglin, the commander of a certain district of ours, went deep into the enemy's rear to restore political power and launch guerrilla warfare, the number of young men and women of Yan and Zhao who have formed regular guerrilla units has exceeded 500,000. Currently, they are mostly engaged in attacking, separately assaulting Lugou Bridge and Wanping, where the Sino-Japanese War broke out, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. After completing their tasks, they calmly returned to a certain place. Since this attack, the enemy in Beiping and Tianjin has become increasingly uneasy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Tianjin news: A train from Beiping directly to Busan was derailed on the evening of the 11th in an area north of Zhang, on the Beiping-Tianjin section, due to the track being destroyed by our guerrillas. The entire train was overturned. This train was a recently organized connection by the enemy, coming from Busan, and was mostly carrying Japanese people, as well as ten enemy soldiers. No one in the entire train was spared from hardship. Railway traffic between Beiping and Tianjin has been completely cut off since the 12th, and has not been restored by evening. Trains in Beiping and Tianjin currently only run to Zhangzhuang, requiring a 20-li walk to change trains. On the morning of the 12th, several enemy troop trains went north from Tianjin and engaged in fierce battles with guerrillas in Langfang and other places. Enemy aircraft also flew to assist in the battle. The Jinpu Railway was also not open to traffic on the 11th, and guerrillas along the line have repeatedly attacked enemy garrisons in recent days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] The first advancing detachment of the first route of the pseudo-suppression bandit army, numbering about 3,000, launched a general attack on Haozhou City in three directions on the 10th. The second battalion of our forces, which advanced to the north of Haozhou, approached Lujia Temple, 25 li northeast of Haozhou, on the evening of the 9th. Cui Huaishan's pseudo-suppression communist army, numbering over 700, stubbornly resisted in the village. Our artillery fire stormed into the village under the cover of darkness. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was routed, with over 30 killed and 7 of our men killed.

Now that the enemy's rear has been cut off by us, reinforcements are difficult. The remnant enemy in the Liulinji area has been surrounded by us. An enemy plane flew to Liulinji as the enemy attempted to break out, leading to a fierce battle. Our brave soldiers charged and killed, finally retaking the area at about 5:00 PM. Over 50 or 60 enemy soldiers were killed on the spot, and 10 enemy vehicles and many other military supplies were captured. And since the enemy's rear has indeed been cut off by us, it will not be difficult to annihilate the remnant enemy in that unit.</p>

<h3>Many Arrested by Enemy in French Concession of Hankou, Under Enemy Blockade and Threat, French Concession Softens Attitude</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Hankou, 13th] Japanese sources say that of the twenty-seven Chinese prisoners transferred yesterday, most have been released. Their fates are unknown. According to Wuhan newspapers, the Japanese military authorities inspected the French Concession yesterday for communists and undesirable elements. The French Concession authorities, in a reversal of their usual attitude, cooperated with the Japanese military. The Japanese military arrested twenty-seven Chinese in hotels, including two important figures who have long been under Japanese surveillance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Hankou news: Of the ten Chinese suspected of being anti-Japanese elements who were arrested by the French Concession authorities and have not yet been released, the Japanese authorities demanded that they be handed over to the Japanese for disposal. However, the authorities stated that sufficient evidence must be presented before extradition. As of yesterday afternoon, the Japanese had not yet been able to present evidence, but the authorities were due to submit it today. The French authorities have also released two people, but the French Concession authorities have now begun to abolish this system, after people could only enter and exit the French Concession with a pass. As a result, no less than several thousand people enter and exit the concession, making it almost impossible for the Japanese guards outside the concession to check whether those entering and exiting hold passes issued by the Japanese. The Japanese said that anti-Japanese elements were hiding in the French Concession, so they continued to blockade the French Concession.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Hankou external news: According to foreigners in the Hankou special zone, only Germans and Japanese are allowed to use electric lights in the zone. According to reliable sources, the Japanese are attempting to cut off the energy supply to the concession.</p>

<h3>Military Supplies Steadily Shipped to China, 60,000 Tons Imported by Ship in Two Months, Czechoslovakia Supplies Us with Large Quantities of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] Japanese reports say that after Britain's loan to China of 10 million, military supplies shipped to China from Burma have increased sharply. In November and December, those supplied by Britain totaled 66,000 tons, and now there are another 60,000 tons still in transit.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The Berlin Daily News carries a report from Prague stating that the Chinese government, through an intermediary, has contacted the Czech government regarding the Bulun and South Bohemian munitions and arms factories. According to this source, the Czech government had sold a majority of the shares of the Bulun arms factory to a private banking consortium. Once this transaction was completed, Chairman Chiang's delegation had already arrived in Prague and began discussing cooperation with the Bulun and South Bohemian arms factories. Furthermore, the Chinese delegation declared that the Chinese government had purchased a large amount of shares in an attempt to strengthen its war effort. According to the intermediary, once the Chinese capital is paid, the two arms factories will be reorganized immediately so that they can deliver goods to China as soon as possible. Although they had received orders from various places beforehand, they would prioritize delivery to China. However, there were whispers that the Czech government was not happy about this.</p>
<h3>Central Office Relations: Speaker of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>——Speech at a Reception for Chongqing Cultural Figures——</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this gathering today came about because Mr. Shao had some thoughts a few days ago. He felt we hadn't had a chance to discuss Sino-Soviet relations with everyone. Therefore, he suggested holding this meeting today. Mr. Shao's original intention was for me to take this opportunity to briefly report to you on Sino-Soviet relations. I also wanted to pique your interest in the Sino-Soviet issue and, at the same time, clarify any doubts you may have.</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, everyone has harbored a hope that our friendly nations could assist China in combating our enemies. This hope was especially fervent regarding the Soviet Union. Therefore, for the past year and a half, many friends, when discussing our country's diplomatic course and the prospects for the War of Resistance, inevitably raised the question: why can't the Soviet Union take further effective action to assist us? This is indeed something that requires our study. We comrades are constantly seeking an answer. This question is very complex and cannot be easily resolved in a short time. Many people believe that Japan is China's only enemy. At the same time, Japan is also the Soviet Union's only enemy in the Far East. Japan is the common enemy of China and the Soviet Union. This time, Japan launched a war of aggression against us. Under the leadership of our supreme leader, we launched a full-scale War of Resistance. From the Soviet Union's perspective, whether from the standpoint of morality or self-interest, it should naturally stand on China's side, hoping that China can thoroughly resist and achieve final victory. However, since Japan is the common enemy of China and the Soviet Union, it seems that the two countries should come out together to deal with it. Why is China still fighting alone militarily? There are many factors involved. Because the Soviet Union, for the past decade, has pursued a national policy of peaceful nation-building. Only by maintaining peace can their construction succeed. Therefore, since the revolution, the Soviet Union has adopted peace as its national policy for the past decade. At the same time, it knew that this peace could not be maintained without uniting with peace-loving countries around the world to jointly shoulder this responsibility. Therefore, a few years ago, the Soviet Union changed its national policy and joined the League of Nations. Its biggest motivation was to unite with Britain, France, the United States, and other peace-loving countries, the so-called democratic countries, to work together to maintain world peace. This is beyond doubt. Since the September 28th Incident, the Soviet authorities, seeing that the League of Nations, a tool for peace, was already powerless and probably unable to maintain peace, hoped to restore diplomatic relations with China and jointly safeguard peace in the Far East. After the September 18th Incident, China and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations. The resumption of diplomatic relations was indeed a major turning point in Sino-Soviet diplomacy. A strong foundation for friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union should have been immediately established. At this time, the Soviet authorities were very eager to get closer to China. People who paid attention to the international situation also felt that China and the Soviet Union must get closer. However, due to various domestic circumstances at the time, there were many difficulties. Therefore, Sino-Soviet relations did not make greater progress before the July 7th Incident. Japan saw clearly that although China had resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, it would not have further relations. China's resistance power must be weak. Therefore, it took the initiative to launch an invasion of China. After the war broke out, many people blamed the Soviet Union for not helping China. But the Soviet Union had its reasons for doing so. Because Sino-Soviet relations, after the September 18th Incident and before the July 7th Incident, if they could have been closer, then Japan would not have dared to act rashly. The reason why Japan dared to attack China was because China and the Soviet Union had not actually united. For a considerable period, China would not receive foreign aid. Therefore, the enemy hoped for a quick victory. Since China and the Soviet Union had no treaty obligations after the war broke out, the Soviet authorities naturally had to carefully study how to help China and whether to send troops. According to their national policy, they could not immediately change their fundamental policy. Their national policy was to build the country through peace. Regarding the issue of sending troops to jointly confront Japan, in their view, if a military mutual assistance agreement had been signed before the war broke out, then once the enemy invaded China, the Soviet Union would naturally have the treaty obligation to send troops to support it. Unfortunately, this kind of treaty was not signed before the Lugouqiao Incident. As for who should be responsible for not signing the treaty, there is no need to study it now. However, since the Soviet Union had no treaty obligations to China, it was not responsible for not sending troops to help us.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to send troops, Japan would have to attack the Soviet Union at the same time. But our enemy is very cunning. It felt that with the strength of one country, fighting against China and the Soviet Union at the same time would be difficult to win. Especially towards the Soviet Union, it dared not take risks. Therefore, before the Lugouqiao Incident, it tested the Soviet Union once. In June of the previous year, a conflict occurred on the Songhua River on the border between the puppet Manchuria and the Soviet Union. This was to test whether the Soviet Union was determined to fight Japan. At that time, the Soviet Union felt that its national defense preparations were not sufficient and that there was no need to make a fuss. Therefore, it showed concession to the incident, and the result was a peaceful resolution. Japan thought that the Soviet Union would not act, so it decided to deal with China first, hoping to achieve results in a short time, and thus the July 7th Incident occurred. In July of last year, the enemy again provoked the Zhanggufeng Incident. We know that Zhanggufeng was originally a Chinese territory. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the boundary was demarcated with Tsarist Russia, and it was included in Russian territory. The terrain of Zhanggufeng is very dangerous, with high mountains on one side and the Tumen River on the south. If defensive fortifications are built in this area to form a fortress, it would pose a great threat to Japan's transportation line in the Tumen River area of Korea. For ten years, neither Japan nor Russia had taken action in this area. But in early July of last year, the Soviet Union suddenly sent troops to Zhanggufeng to set up defenses. Japan protested, saying that this area belonged to the puppet Manchuria. The Japanese ambassador protested in Moscow. The Soviet foreign minister took out the Qing Dynasty boundary map to prove that the area was not within the puppet Manchuria. Japan was very worried about this incident and was determined to seize this place. It immediately sent troops to seize it. Later, the Soviet Union used airplanes and heavy artillery to bombard the Japanese army, and as a result, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. Japan knew that the Soviet Union was prepared and only then did it compromise to avoid a Japanese-Soviet war. This proves that Japan does not have the strength to strike at the Soviet Union at the same time and can only concentrate its forces to invade our country. If the Soviet Union were able to send troops, I am afraid that the war would have ended long ago. Regarding this issue, when I was in Moscow last year, the Soviet authorities put forward several explanations. From their standpoint, the Soviet Union's sympathy and assistance to China are beyond question. Even if no one in China raised this issue, the Soviet Union would sincerely help China. But it is not easy for China to hope that they will send troops. If they are to send troops, one of the following conditions must be met: First, the League of Nations must implement the resolutions of the covenant and jointly assume responsibility for punishing the aggressor, in which case the Soviet Union can assume the task of implementation. If the sanctions resolution is not passed, at least the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France must unite with the Soviet Union to form a united front and jointly sanction the aggressor. If neither of the above two points can be achieved, then we can only wait for Japan to invade the Soviet border, in which case the Soviet Union will naturally defend itself and strike at the aggressor. So</p>
<p>The issue of Soviet troops, a year ago was like this, now is still the same. As for whether the Soviet Union, in addition to sending troops, has provided us with assistance, and to what extent, I think you must all be very clear. Before the July 7th Incident, the former Soviet ambassador returned to China and raised this issue with us, expressing three hopes for our country: first, that China would initiate a Pacific Peace Conference; second, that China and the Soviet Union would sign a non-aggression pact; and finally, that they would sign a mutual assistance agreement. After our research at the time, we felt that the Pacific Conference would not be effective because Japan would definitely oppose it. If Japan did not participate, then Britain and the United States could not ignore Japan's important relations in the Far East. If Japan did send representatives to attend, the Japanese representatives would definitely disrupt the discussion of Pacific issues, and the conference would not be effective. So, at that time, we replied to the Soviet Union with this opinion. Soon after, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, so the issue of the Pacific Conference has become a thing of the past and does not need to be mentioned. Secondly, the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was signed in August of the previous year. However, the mutual assistance agreement has not yet been implemented because the signing of a</p>
<p>Mutual assistance agreement after the war has broken out is completely different in nature from signing it before the war has broken out. The purpose of this kind of agreement is to prevent war in advance. If we had signed a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union before the July 7th Incident, then the Sino-Japanese war might not have happened. So, a mutual assistance agreement has this kind of effect before the war breaks out. But once the war has broken out, the meaning is different. If China and the Soviet Union sign a mutual assistance agreement at this time, the Soviet Union would have to send troops immediately. In the past year, the situation in Europe has been very volatile. Various authorities are actively thinking about how to maintain the peaceful situation in Europe and how to deal with the European war. In the past year, the Soviet Union has also been engaged in expanding its preparations. Assuming that a European war breaks out, the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by and will definitely be drawn into the vortex. The Soviet Union may find it difficult to cope with enemies on both sides in terms of national defense and military preparations. Especially since Britain, the United States, and France advocate maintaining peace in Europe, if the Soviet Union takes active action in the Far East, it would divert the strength of Europe, which Britain, the United States, and France would not want. Therefore, the Soviet Union can only provide moral, diplomatic, and material assistance to our country, and in the past eighteen months, it has actually provided quite a bit. Talking about this, let us</p>
<p>Regarding our diplomatic route, a few months ago, when I was overseas, I heard that someone at the first National Political Council mentioned the so-called "German-Italian diplomatic route." Rumors overseas made me feel very strange. Why are we so confused? We know that joining the German-Italian route is the same as joining the enemy's camp. Taking this route is only possible if we are prepared to have them introduce our country to surrender to Japan and ask for peace. Otherwise, if the German-Italian route could work, our ambassador to Italy would not have returned. This is something that our former ambassador to Germany and Italy can understand. Since the War of Resistance, Germany and Italy have only scolded China as an uncivilized country, not an enlightened nation, the second Abyssinia, while Japan is a modern civilized country. The strong bullying the weak is a natural law, and they treat us like this, yet we still hope to take this route? Isn't that confused?</p>
<p>Our current diplomatic route is very open: it is the route of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, the route of peaceful countries. We are friendly with the Soviet Union and also have close relations with Britain, the United States, and France. In fact, there is no conflict. The Soviet Union also hopes that we will do this. Although the Soviet Union is the strongest in military preparations in the Far East, the time has not yet come. At the same time, the Soviet Union does not want to bear this responsibility alone. The Soviet Union specifically told us that it hopes that China will not solely rely</p>
<p>On Soviet aid. Regarding the Far East, if the Soviet Union were to act without hesitation, without waiting for the unanimous agreement of Britain, the United States, and France, and bravely stepped forward, the Japanese warlords would definitely propagandize domestically, saying that they sent troops to China to prevent communism. They would also propagandize abroad, saying that they were preventing communism. Furthermore, they would say that since the Soviet Union is helping China, it must be trying to communize China. If this were the case, it would invisibly increase their propaganda power greatly. Britain, the United States, and France would inevitably have misunderstandings. Especially Britain, whose commercial interests in China are the greatest. Britain does not want Japan to defeat China, but at the same time, it is afraid of the Soviet Union taking the lead in the Far East. Therefore, if the Soviet Union were to send troops to defeat Japan before Britain, the United States, and France reached a consensus, the Soviet Union would become the leader of the Far East, and its power would greatly increase. Then Britain would definitely become suspicious and might unite with other countries to deal with the Soviet Union, which would actually be the same as dealing with China. Japan's invasion of China, China's fight for survival, is beyond doubt. In the modern world, no matter the size of the nation, without national spirit, it cannot exist. We, a nation of 450 million people, must have this spirit of resisting for national survival. Therefore, the reason for China's War of Resistance is originally very simple. If the situation becomes complicated because the Soviet Union sends troops, Japan will definitely say that China has been communized, which would obscure the nature of China's war of liberation. This situation would not be good for either China or the Soviet Union. Therefore, we... (To be continued. Please see today's editorial)</p>

<h3>Rome Talks End: Italy Doesn't Abandon Ambition to Invade, British PM Reveals Weariness</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Chamberlain and Halifax, together with Mussolini, this afternoon drove to the sports ground to watch the gymnastics performance of Fascist young men and women (from six to sixteen years old), receiving enthusiastic cheers from 20,000 people. During the performance, Mr. Zhang stood on the stage and frequently expressed praise for the skill of the 5,000 performers. After the performance, before leaving the field with Mussolini and Halifax, they again received cheers from the crowd. From 5:35 PM to 6:50 PM this afternoon, Chamberlain, Mussolini, Halifax, and Ciano held formal talks. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Zhang declined to make a statement. He was slightly affected by a cold and showed weariness. Halifax, on the other hand, was smiling and shook hands with many acquaintances. It is believed that during today's meeting, Mussolini made a lengthy narrative about Spain, requesting that Franco be granted the rights of a belligerent group, saying that this step is extremely important for appeasing the general situation, especially the Mediterranean. It is heard that Mr. Mo said that if Franco is granted the rights of a belligerent group, Italy will consider withdrawing its volunteer soldiers. Formal negotiations between the two countries have now lasted for two days. It is generally believed that, in terms of diplomacy, Mr. Zhang's visit to Italy will have no results. Today's talks do not seem to be as harmonious as last night. It is difficult to hope that the Zhang-Mo talks will become a prelude to close cooperation between the two countries on a wide range of issues to seek peace. It is heard that Mr. Mo did not clearly define his demands on France, and still did not reduce his so-called "natural desire" in the slightest, and was unwilling to modify his policy of assisting Franco. He originally hoped that Chamberlain would urge France to make concessions in order to appease the situation. He now knows the true attitude of Britain. It is believed that if the French-Italian dispute is resolved in accordance with proper negotiation procedures, Britain will be willing to mediate to achieve the goal. In the talks, both Mr. Zhang and Mr. Mo expressed their desire for peace, and stated that differences in political systems are not enough to hinder the friendship between the two countries. It is believed that Mr. Mo will also reiterate that he is willing to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean and does not seek any special interests in Spain. Although the true intention of Italy has not yet been determined, it is believed that Italy will rely on the support of the Axis powers (Germany) to realize its desires, regardless of how Britain and France are connected. The impression that this meeting will have no results has been reflected in the general public, and they do not deny their sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 13th] The British side here expressed pessimism about the obvious failure of the British-Italian talks on Thursday evening. The most promising issues of the Mediterranean and Spain could not be resolved in a practical way in the one-hour talk between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, and the two-hour frank talk between Mussolini and Chamberlain. British-Italian relations are extremely obvious and need no further clarification, and the Italian side is optimistic about this point. Therefore, the British side does not understand why the negotiations are delayed again when British and Italian political leaders meet. From this point of view, it can be shown that the opinions of both sides are still far apart. As for the Spanish issue, both sides seem to be strong. The Italian side is convinced that the rebels will win, so it is unwilling to make concessions on the withdrawal of volunteer troops from the west. However, both sides are clearly preparing to make preliminary compromises. According to those with inside information, the opinion of the semi-official report on Thursday is that Mussolini will withdraw the territorial demands for the sake of maintaining friendly relations with France, but the French government must give Italians better treatment in Tunisia. Regarding the Suez Canal and the Djibouti Railway, both sides seem to have agreed that the Italian side will exercise part of the management rights, but no documents of agreement have been established, and the negotiations are still in progress. The Italian government is extremely silent on the meeting, but it has great hopes, and at the same time, it is very possible that Mussolini will meet with the British political leaders again before leaving Rome.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 12th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, at 5:35 PM today, went to the Venice Palace and held the second round of talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, which lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. According to reliable sources, during today's talks, the British and Italian prime ministers spoke very little, and only the two foreign ministers explained their views. The general atmosphere at that time can be seen from this. Diplomatic sources said that the British-Italian talks are practically over, and neither side has accepted any constraints. The two sides have had serious discussions on certain specific issues, and it is still unknown whether a decision has been made. Insiders said that the British-Italian talks did not achieve concrete results and that a final communiqué will be issued to explain the situation in a very harmonious manner. Both sides are willing to promote friendly relations. It also said that the talks touched on various political issues, and although the British and Italian views were not completely consistent, they have understood each other. British political figures said that the British-Italian talks did not establish an agreement, but only explained the positions of both sides on important issues in Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 12th] Ciano met with the representative of the Spanish National Military Government in Italy today and told him about the talks between the British and Italian cabinet members. British Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to talk with the French Ambassador to Italy tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 13th] The British press is greatly disappointed with the official report issued by the British side in Rome, saying that its content only reports that the British cabinet members went to see a play, while the important documents allowed to be published were not mentioned. They believe that the official silence is due to the frank attitude of both sides during the meeting, which failed to achieve a concrete result. It is reported that Mussolini showed Chamberlain a table containing the situation and facts that Italy cannot fight, and Mr. Zhang was satisfied after reading it. At the meeting on Thursday, Chamberlain and Mussolini discussed the issue of Abyssinia and raised the issue of the settlement of Jews in the Italian Empire. According to reports, because many extremely important European issues have not yet been resolved, these secondary issues will not be raised for the time being. According to reports from Rome, this meeting discussed not only the Mediterranean and Spanish issues, but also other issues, such as maintaining trade in Central Europe and Southern Europe and guaranteeing the borders of Czechoslovakia, which all need to be resolved. Therefore, all secondary issues will be resolved through ordinary diplomatic channels.</p>
<h3>Carrying Out International Adventures: Germany to Have Important Military Action on the Dutch Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] The famous political commentator Madame Tabouis wrote in "Work Report" today, "Hitler has notified Mussolini that from next Tuesday, there will be important military actions on the Dutch border. The purpose of this action is to make democratic countries understand that German generals believe that now is the right time to carry out international adventures."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 12th] Here today, a new anti-Jewish movement suddenly began, and the Netherlands was asked to suppress its Jewish propaganda. According to yesterday, a shooting incident occurred, which the Germans believed was done by Jews. National Socialists said that if Germans are shot and injured, Germany will take retaliatory measures against Jews again.</p>
<h3>Memelland Nazi-ized: Parliament Already Controlled</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Kaunas, 12th] Memelland Governor Gilius allowed the appointment of the National Socialist Party member Bertuleit as the director of the Memelland Supervisory Authority. The rest of the staff of the authority are all National Socialists. The parliament after the re-election is almost entirely controlled by the National Socialists and will meet at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Increases Budget: Develops Military Industry</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] The Soviet authorities, in order to accelerate the production of the country's defense industry, have completely reorganized the National Defense Industry Committee and established four committees, namely Aviation, Shipbuilding, Ammunition, and Armaments. This step reflects the expansion of the country's defense industry after the increase in the budget for the army and navy. Last year's budget increased by 35% compared to the previous year, totaling more than 100 million pounds, of which 400 million pounds were for the development of military industry.</p>
<h3>Atlantic: Britain and the United States Fortify, Navy Department Extremely Concerned</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 12th] Today, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy Department said that the Japanese Navy Department is "extremely concerned" about the fortification of the Atlantic by Britain and the United States. He mentioned the strengthening of defenses by the United States in Guam, saying that the United States has no such necessity.</p>
<h3>American Espionage Case: Two Have Been Convicted, Two Others Will Be Tried</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Panama, 12th] Four Germans accused of espionage in the Panama Canal Zone, one of them, Eugen Grulich, was convicted today. The jurors deliberated repeatedly for up to seven hours beforehand. The other two, Robert Grosse and Ingeborg Gutmann (female), will be tried separately in a few days. Another person named Hans Schachtkau was convicted last month.</p>
<h3>Mexican Rebel Leader Cedillo Killed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mexico City, 12th] The famous rebel leader General Cedillo was killed in battle with government forces in the mountains of San Luis Potosi today. Cedillo had been in open rebellion against the Cardenas government since May of last year. From now on, rebels who disagree with the government have been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Visited the Pope Yesterday, Halifax Accompanied</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 13th] Chamberlain watched a play late last night and caught a slight cold. After a short rest this morning, he drove to the Vatican at 11 o'clock to visit the Pope. Due to the urgency of time, the Pope specially changed the etiquette and allowed him to wear morning clothes instead of formal dress. Those who accompanied Mr. Zhang included Halifax, the British Special Envoy to the Holy See, Osborne, and Bishop Hinfray. Thousands of British expatriates in Rome cheered along the way, and the scene was very enthusiastic. When Mr. Zhang and others arrived at the Vatican, many guards in strange medieval-style yellow and green uniforms offered salutes to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang later visited the Secretary of State of the Holy See, who will return the visit to the British Special Envoy to the Holy See.</p>
<h3>Frankfurter Appointed to US Supreme Court Judge, Approved by Legal Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] President Roosevelt proposed to the Senate to appoint Felix Frankfurter, a Jewish professor of law at Harvard University, as a judge of the Supreme Court. A subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved it and handed it over to the full committee for passage before submitting it to the Senate. It is likely that someone in the Senate will object to it.</p>
<h3>Actively Strengthening National Defense: US President Submits Special Message, Urging Congress to Pass Immediately, Especially Emphasizing Protection of the Panama Canal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] US President Roosevelt submitted a special message on national defense to Congress today, stating that the nation should not suffer from hysteria. He pointed out that the US entered the war on April 6, 1917, but did not participate in any major battles until the end of May 1918. Even by the autumn of 1918, American troops on the front lines were almost entirely dependent on the heavy artillery and aircraft of Britain and France. This indicates that the US did not conduct large-scale land and air force operations in 1917. "Comparatively speaking, our preparations today are not much greater than they were then. We cannot guarantee a long period free from attack to allow us to prepare. Our most pressing need today compels me to state in this session of Congress that $525,000,000 should be appropriated as quickly as possible, of which $120,000,000 should be allocated by the Treasury Department before the end of June 1940. These funds will allocate $450,000,000 to the Army, $65,000,000 to the Navy, and $10,000,000 for training pilots. Regarding the Army, information obtained from various countries necessitates a thorough revision of our air force estimates. Responsible officials have consistently proposed that our air force must expand in both quantity and production capacity to be competitive with certain nations. We are only concerned with necessary defense, but our current defensive strength is not sufficient and needs to be strengthened immediately. The Army needs various types of aircraft, costing a total of $300,000,000. The minimum number of aircraft should be 3,000. It is hoped that ordering such a large quantity of aircraft at once will greatly reduce the unit price, thereby allowing for the purchase of more aircraft in practice. In addition, several plans have been proposed to greatly strengthen the air defense of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Panama Canal Zone. Congress can quickly pass an 'Appropriations Bill.' I dare suggest that $50,000,000 be drawn from the aforementioned $300,000,000 to meet urgent needs, as the current delays in the delivery of aircraft from several factories have created deficiencies that can be immediately rectified." Roosevelt also stated that within the $65,000,000 naval appropriations budget, it should be divided into: (1) $44,000,000 to build or strengthen naval bases on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides; (2) $21,000,000 to replenish naval aircraft and aviation materials and for experimentation. Finally, to strengthen national defense, a certain number of new air force pilots must be trained each year. It is believed that by cooperating with the government and various educational institutions, $10,000,000 annually can provide preliminary training for approximately 20,000 new pilots. As for the Panama Canal, it is a critical hub, but the defensive forces within the canal zone during peacetime are insufficient. Therefore, the minimum number of anti-aircraft artillery units and coastal defense personnel should be increased to protect the canal. Thus, Roosevelt suggested allocating $27,000,000 to strengthen peacetime defenses and provide adequate housing for the defensive forces. Roosevelt stated that the government's peaceful intentions are evident to all, and the world knows that we have no intention of aggression, nor will we seek to expand territory. However, as head of state, I must address the facts. While the quality of our people is excellent, without modern weapons or sufficient training, they will be unable to defend themselves if attacked. We should not force our young people to go to the battlefield with old weapons. Therefore, I hope Congress will immediately pass the emergency bill to strengthen US defense."</p>
<p>Defense Proposal to be Approved</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The content of President Roosevelt's defense proposal has deeply moved Congress. Therefore, his recommendations are likely to be approved by Congress without significant opposition. This point seems beyond doubt. In fact, only Congressman Hamilton Fish opposes the proposal, claiming that "this proposal is nothing more than a red, white, and blue ribbon wrapped around a leaky tire." Republican leader Vandenberg stated that while the severity of the external threats mentioned by President Roosevelt may be questionable, they should be given careful attention, as they come from the commander-in-chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Senator Wagner stated that while it is regrettable that we must spend such a large sum on military expenditures, President Roosevelt's requests are considered moderate given the global situation. Furthermore, it was expected that Senator Nye would advocate opposition, but Nye did not criticize it. The front-page news from Europe today will undoubtedly aid President Roosevelt's recommendations. The German "Foreign Communications Report" advocated for pressure on Dutch neutrality. All newspapers unanimously published this news, second only to the news of Chamberlain's negotiations in Rome. Congressmen in the lounge also expressed dissatisfaction with the German newspaper's arguments. One congressman told our correspondent, "Anyone who does not want interference from fascist countries must have military preparations, as their second step will be to imprison American Jews in concentration camps. The only way to deal with fascist countries... is to use Theodore Roosevelt's (translator's note: referring to former US President Theodore Roosevelt) big stick."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Announces Statement</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Following President Roosevelt's national defense message, the local Chamber of Commerce announced a statement, stating that the US aircraft manufacturing industry manufactured 1,800 aircraft in 1918 and can manufacture 5,500 aircraft in 1939. While some believe that the US aircraft manufacturing industry has almost reached its production capacity limit, several key military aircraft factories are not yet fully operational. It is heard that the US Army and Navy Departments have drafted plans to accelerate the production of certain types of aircraft. Manufacturing plants that are too busy can transfer manufacturing tasks to other, less busy factories.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Senator Reynolds stated today that the Pacific coast is most vulnerable to attack, urging the government to strengthen defenses from California to Alaska, as Japan is very close to the Aleutian Islands. He also stated, "If the United States is invaded, this invasion will undoubtedly come from the Pacific. Very few Americans know that aircraft from Japan can reach American soil in just a few minutes." Finally, Reynolds suggested building a military highway from Seattle through Columbia to Vancouver.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Comment on American Plans</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] "The Times" stated today, "The prominent feature of President Roosevelt's defense plan is the emphasis on the need to protect the Panama Canal. President Roosevelt detailed the urgency and imperative need for national defense, fulfilling his promise from last week. Americans do not believe that any part of American territory faces a real danger of being directly or suddenly attacked. Only the South American and Pacific regions may face perilous situations that affect American interests. These are paramount interests that the United States considers very important and will protect at any cost. Once America prepares its defenses and implements strong defenses, its views and interests will receive due consideration from all nations of the world."</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Establishing an Invincible New Air Force</h3>
<p>Following the overall improvement of the war situation, newspapers have been reporting on China's active expansion of its air force. Yesterday, the New York Tribune reported that our government has signed a $3.5 million USD contract with the American Blanc Aircraft Manufacturing Plant to purchase aircraft. The first batch of aircraft, including two large bombers, will be delivered in March. In addition, the continuous arrival of large numbers of Soviet aircraft and aviation specialists in China is an established fact. We, who have escaped death from the bombings by Japanese military aircraft, or are currently threatened by Japanese bombings, must feel incomparable joy upon hearing this news. Because if our air force has greater development, it can not only stop the indiscriminate bombings by Japanese aircraft, but also directly warn the invaders with counter-offensive actions. Furthermore, the past eighteen months of air force resistance have proven that our air force's strength is not only not inferior to the Japanese, but also several times stronger. We need not list the great victory in the Wuhan air battle and the punitive expedition to the three islands. Looking at the loss of 1,851 Japanese aircraft (reported by General He Yingqin on the 9th) is enough to understand. It should be clearly pointed out here: First, we must firmly adhere to the anti-aggression stance and strive for greater international assistance. This international assistance not only benefits China but also helps human civilization because the invaders' aircraft are now intensifying the bombing of innocent civilians in our vast rear areas and destroying all economic construction! Second, we must strengthen our confidence in self-reliance, use double the effort to support the government and help the government, and enhance our country's international prestige. We must dedicate manpower and money and expand propaganda to establish an invincible new air force.</p>
<p>Two Notable Statistics</p>
<p>On the 9th, Military Administration Minister He Yingqin reported that in the past year, the Japanese army has spent an average of 300 million Japanese yen per month on military expenses, with a total of 700,000 casualties, 649 aircraft shot down, and 2,202 aircraft damaged in accidents. More than 580 warships were injured.</p>
<p>On the same day, the Eighth Route Army's Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, upon returning from Chongqing to his defense area, stated that in the past year, the Eighth Route Army had seized one-fifth of the Japanese troops in the provinces of Chahar, Hebei, and Shanxi, seizing a total of 9,100 rifles, 19 artillery pieces, 30 small mortars, and 500 machine guns, destroying 124 aircraft, and killing a Japanese brigade commander and two regimental commanders, capturing countless Japanese officers and soldiers. This proves that the content of the Japanese army's so-called "victory" is actually the Japanese army's greatest failure. This failure has now begun and is expanding day by day. Those who advocate defeat and surrender have not seen this point. At the same time, it also proves that although the Eighth Route Army is in a particularly difficult environment, it has also won victories from the Japanese. This kind of victory absolutely does not belong to the Communist Party alone, but to all of China. Those stubborn elements who blindly echo anti-communism have lost their basis for argument here.</p>
<h3>British People's Views on the Sino-Japanese War: A Year's Worth of Observations (Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in London)</h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>First Glimpse</p>
<p>"Chinese or Japanese?"</p>
<p>This was the first question asked by a porter who came to carry luggage onto the train. As soon as he learned that I was Chinese, he immediately showed a smile, constantly throwing out many questions about the Sino-Japanese War, and escorted me all the way to a "Taxi" outside the station. He raised his hand in salute, took the money, said "I hope you have good luck," and then closed the car door.</p>
<p>——Everything was filled with a deep sense of kinship.</p>
<p>The "Taxi" sped towards its destination on the slippery road from Victoria Station. Sitting in the car, I couldn't help but have such thoughts floating in my heart. So, this is the capital of England, which we in our country are constantly watching as a friendly nation.</p>
<p>This was at eleven o'clock in the evening on January 13, 1938.</p>
<p>Attitude of British Public Opinion</p>
<p>The most important part of British public opinion, of course, is the newspapers. Among them, the one that openly labels itself as "the world's largest circulation" is the "Daily Express." It is said that its daily circulation is more than three million copies. Different from it, the "Daily Mail" fulfills the task of providing spiritual nourishment to the general public in Britain. Compared with any other newspaper, these two have a greater impact on the perceptions of the general public in Britain. They are truly "British newspapers." From the editorials and articles they have published from time to time in the past year, their sympathy for China is very obvious. However, they seem to have many misunderstandings about the actual situation. Therefore, they more or less express their attitude by being restricted by the evolution of the war situation. According to the reporter's memory, the period around the Taierzhuang victory was the golden age of our China's status in these two newspapers; and in the roughly ten days after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, they almost intentionally carried less news on this aspect. There are two more newspapers belonging to the same category but with slightly less influence, one is the "Daily News," and the other is the "Reflection Daily."</p>
<p>In the past year, the newspapers with the most resolute stance and consistent attitude in Britain were only two: one is the "Times," which has represented the British government for many years, and the other is the "Workers' Daily," which represents the British Communist Party. The former is a world-class newspaper, and the latter is a newspaper for the British working class. Until now, most of its funding still comes from readers' donations. However, the former is based on the British government's intelligence and follows the British government's policies, while the latter is based on the reports of the Third International spread throughout the world's labor force, aiming to maintain the socialist homeland of the world and overthrow fascism. Therefore, no matter how the actual war evolves, the main points of the "Times's" argument have always been: (1) No matter what, Japan cannot defeat China, (2) Chairman Chiang is the great leader of China, (3) China's "Communist Party" is no longer "red." The "Workers' Daily's" argument is: (1) China will definitely defeat Japan, the question is only sooner or later; (2) The "United Front" is the most powerful weapon in this war in China, (3) Respect Chairman Chiang's leadership and praise the policies of the Chinese Communist Party. Their positions and attitudes have always been consistent. From the Taierzhuang victory to the Xuzhou Campaign to the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, they have not shown any signs of wavering.</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
<h3>Guo Moruo Talks about Japanese Political Turmoil: Saionji's Last Card Fails; the Aggression is at its End</h3>
<p>[Special correspondent from Chongqing for this newspaper] The partners of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association held a meeting in the air raid shelter yesterday afternoon to welcome their honorary director, Mr. Guo Moruo, the director of the Third Department of the Political Department, who recently returned to Sichuan from the front line.</p>
<p>In the reporters' meeting venue, a small room was decorated delicately enough. A long table was covered with various snacks. This was a small expression of their gratitude to Mr. Guo!</p>
<p>More than twenty young people sat around the table. Mr. Guo sat in the middle, and everyone chatted casually, without any scruples or conventions.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo opened his speech by rewarding this group of young people, saying: "Because of our service, we are relatively close to young reporters, and we know relatively more. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, you have indeed done the greatest responsibility, and you have made indelible contributions to the country. This should be a respect for you!" His words made the young people present feel their cheeks flushing.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Guo began to purchase various questions about the changes in the Japanese political situation:</p>
<p>He first elaborated that since the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese political situation has always been in the hands of the steady and the young factions, turning back and forth. The two factions have the same principle of advocating aggression against China. The difference is only in the means and attitudes of aggression. The steady faction is represented by financial groups, political parties, elders, and senior officials. They advocate adopting a gradual approach and carrying out chronic aggression against China from the economic or political aspect, while the young faction is represented by radical soldiers in the military. They advocate using a strong and convenient military policy to attack China. Due to the difference in the attitudes of these two factions towards the invasion of China, the Japanese political situation has never been peaceful. The "May 15th" and "February 26th" incidents, which shocked the world in the past, were all evil results caused by this difference.</p>
<p>The field army soldiers made a big fuss in the capital and killed the heads of state, which may have caused civil strife. But in fact, both incidents were declared to be quelled within a short period of time and did not expand. This should all be attributed to the subtle political skills of Duke Saionji.</p>
<p>Saionji is the only surviving fruit among the current Japanese veterans and senior officials. He is the spokesperson for financial capitalists. Of course, he can't stand the rampant policies of young soldiers. Therefore, he uses the authority given to him by historical tradition and his natural flexible political skills to play with young soldiers in his hands, so that the phenomenon of friction and opposition between them will never be reduced.</p>
<p>Saionji's policy of containing the young faction also changes with the changes of the environment. Before the "February 26th" incident, Saionji would nominate the head of the navy to form a cabinet (such as Xiao Okada, etc.) to use the power of the navy to contain the army. The fact that the "February 26th" incident was not expanded is a concrete manifestation of the success of this policy. ——On this point, Mr. Guo specially cited something he heard in Tokyo at the time: On the day of "February 26," the army was rampant in Kyoto, and its arrogance was boundless. Later, the first and second navy brigades concentrated in Tokyo Bay within ten hours, threatening the army to withdraw, and only then was the great chaos quelled—— After "February 26," Saionji changed his past policy and recommended figures from the army to join the cabinet (such as Ugaki Hayashi, and even Konoe, etc.) to use the power of one faction in the army to contain another faction, so that they would fight against each other and start differentiation! However, Saionji's political skills, although extremely brilliant, are no match for the crazy arrogance of the young soldiers. The advent of the Konoe Cabinet can be said to be Saionji's last card, thinking that this "all-round" "political star" can be used to give the young soldiers the final blow, but the result is to fail, only watching a complete country go to the road of self-destruction in the war. The great Japanese politician Ozaki Yukio once said, "Let the young soldiers run into each other. Otherwise, their crazy arrogance will never stop." This best represents the heartfelt opinions of the steady faction.</p>
<p>Now, Japan's fascist demon king Hiranuma Kiichirō has taken the stage. He is Saionji's nemesis. Before each new cabinet in Japan was formed, there was a call for him to form a cabinet, but each time he was controlled by Saionji and could not get his wish. This time, the Hiranuma cabinet was established in a short period of eighteen hours, which is an unprecedented record. This proves that the steady faction of Saionji is becoming more and more declining!</p>
<p>Hiranuma's taking the stage seems to have a more negative impact on China on the surface. In fact, it is a manifestation of the exhaustion of Japanese aggression. The seven conditions put forward by Itagaki recently are full of contradictions. Hiranuma also admitted that Japan has reached a difficult juncture unprecedented in history. The domestic political economy is also collapsing day by day in the current military predicament, which shows that it is not far from the time of defeat. On the other hand, since the teaching country has been resisting the war for a year and a half, the material losses are significant, and the new forces are increasing day by day. The day of final victory is in sight.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Guo also put forward two points: the lowest standard of living in the rear and the supply of cultural food to the front line, hoping that people in the press will work hard to promote them. (1, 8, Jingye.)</p>

<h3>Relief Federation Writes to All Hong Kong Overseas Groups, Requesting Efforts to Donate and Relieve Disaster Victims. Special Standing Committee Meeting to be Held Today to Discuss Relief of Victims in Bolo. Relocation of all Refugee Stations in the New Territories Completed.</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Community Relief for South China Refugees will hold a special extraordinary meeting at 11:00 AM today for the purpose of discussing the issue of allocating funds to provide aid to refugees from Bolo. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to various overseas groups, requesting an enthusiastic outpouring of aid to concentrate financial resources to expand the relief of disaster victims. The original letter is as follows: It is respectfully stated that since our country has entered the second phase of the War of Resistance, the disaster areas are vast, and the number of disaster-stricken compatriots awaiting relief is countless. Although this association has actively distributed aid separately, the disaster situation is enormous, and the donations are not large, which ultimately causes us to feel that it is like using a dipper of water to extinguish a cartload of burning firewood. Hong Kong has always been known as a prosperous area, and various groups, since joining this association, have been selfless in their donations, but there are still many who have not yet shown any effort. For this reason, this letter is sent to you in the hope that, for the sake of the country's future revival, it is truly necessary for the entire nation to contribute money and effort. To those who have already donated, this association expresses its deep gratitude, but still hopes that they will continue their efforts to assist. To those who have not yet donated, please do your best to donate. More is certainly a great merit, but even a little is enough to contribute to the whole, so that this association can concentrate its financial resources and expand the relief of disaster victims. It is greatly hoped that you will reply at your convenience.</p>
<p>In addition, the Relief Group of the Relief Federation held a meeting at Tung Wah Hospital yesterday. Attendees included Lin Peisheng, Xie Yaoxiang, Liang Xizhi, and Lin Tieleng, etc. Chairman Lin Peisheng reported on the follow-up situation of the relocation of various stations, stating that all refugee stations in the New Territories have been relocated. Today is the day after the relocation of the Yuen Long station. However, the number of refugees moving to the New Territories is very small. The Shenzhen Reception Center is actively arranging and proceeding, and can accommodate 4,000 refugees. The large dining hall is now under construction, and the bamboo bridge has also begun construction. Medical services have also begun providing medicine and treatment. Immediately after, discussions began on: (1) Regarding future relief work, it can be carried out uniformly and systematically. The group's weekly Friday meeting can be temporarily cancelled. If there are special events, it can be convened at any time. Two days' notice will be given in advance for each meeting. (2) The China Youth Relief Team will send personnel to Shenzhen to serve within days. The meeting only adjourned at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Refugee Camp Incident: Unfortunate Event Involving Isolated Troops - One Killed and Several Injured by Indian Soldiers. Authorities Investigated the Cause and Sought Remedies Yesterday.</h3>
<p>A month ago, during fierce fighting between our and other troops in Shenzhen, as the war approached the Sino-British border area, over a thousand of our troops stationed there fought valiantly in isolation. Later, they mistakenly entered British territory due to being lost, and were taken care of by the British authorities in their capacity as a neutral nation. Initially, they were placed on the "Li Hang" ship, anchored off the coast of Sham Shui Po, isolated from the land. After a considerable period, with the completion of the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp, the Hong Kong authorities moved these isolated troops into the refugee camp, surrounded by barbed wire. This relocation happened nearly two months ago. During this period, a series of unfortunate incidents occurred in the camp, with the isolated troops being guarded.</p>
<p>One person was shot and killed by Indian soldiers, and several others were injured. The authorities have not provided a detailed report on the cause of the incident. Although newspapers have made brief mentions, they were fragmentary and did not reveal the full truth of the matter. However, according to information obtained from outsiders, the isolated troops attempted to escape from the camp and were discovered by the Indian soldiers, who opened fire to stop them, resulting in accidental injuries and death. Another version suggests that communication barriers between Chinese and Indian soldiers led to misunderstandings, causing disputes. Regarding the most recent tragic incident, Western newspapers reported that:</p>
<p>The cause of the incident was that the Chinese soldiers in the camp were playing football for recreation. They repeatedly kicked the ball near the barbed wire fence. The players often went near the gate to retrieve the ball. This happened many times, and the guarding Indian soldiers were accustomed to it and paid no attention. However, on that day, the Indian soldiers noticed that someone who was picking up the ball had not returned for a long time, arousing suspicion. They went out to investigate and found someone crossing the iron fence, intending to escape. Upon seeing this, the Indian soldiers fired two shots and ordered him to stop, intending to deter him. The second bullet seemed to have hit the person trying to cross the fence, but he still managed to escape while injured. Afterwards, they summoned all the Indian soldiers and chased after him, but he escaped. During the chase, the Indian troop leader ordered the best shooter to fire at the fleeing soldier, resulting in a hit in the shoulder. The Hong Kong government authorities have recently paid attention to the repeated incidents in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp. The military authorities also believe that they should try to avoid shooting as much as possible within their capabilities, to prevent unfortunate bloodshed. To this end, the authorities convened a meeting yesterday with all relevant parties to discuss the causes of the incidents and find ways to prevent the imprisoned isolated troops from thinking of escaping, while also trying to avoid opening fire. What were the results of the research is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Beware of Pickpockets! - Pickpockets Active on Trams and Buses - Police Undercover and Disguised for a Large-Scale Arrest</h3>
<p>In the past week or two, pickpockets have been very active in Hong Kong. Thieves have infiltrated trams and buses. These pickpockets often wear Western suits, appearing quite respectable and unlike pickpockets. Some wear suits from Hong Kong's second-hand clothing stores that don't fit well, and they often have shifty eyes, looking around nervously. With careful observation, one can tell that they are about to do something suspicious. They often lurk at bus stops, waiting for people boarding. If they see an opportunity, they will board the vehicle with the passenger and use their nimble hands in the crowd. After succeeding, they get off at the next stop. Tram and bus passengers are often unable to defend themselves due to the crowding. After realizing they have been pickpocketed, they can only sigh helplessly. Pickpockets are active on trams and buses because it is easy to operate, so more thieves are turning to this new approach, resulting in more theft cases on trams and buses. This has attracted the attention of the police authorities, who have dispatched many plainclothes detectives disguised as tram and bus passengers to arrest pickpockets on the vehicles in order to maintain social order. They have already made many arrests in recent days. Tram and bus conductors are also assisting the police in making arrests. There have also been several cases of pickpockets being discovered by conductors and handed over to the police. Under the strict arrest of the detectives, pickpockets on trams and buses are no longer as active as before. It is expected that after a considerable period of time, they will disappear.</p>
<h3>Soong Ching-ling Inspects Disaster Areas in Zhongshan</h3>
<p>Madam Soong Ching-ling, along with Madam Wu Chao-chu, Madam He Bao-fang, and others, recently went to inspect the disaster areas in Zhongshan, Macau. She frequently met with County Magistrate Zhang (Huichang) and other local authorities. Madam Soong repeatedly inquired about the situation of the disaster victims in various districts of Zhongshan, and gave many instructions on relief work. Madam Soong personally visited the disaster victims in various districts, expressing her condolences and deep concern. The disaster victims were all deeply grateful. During this trip, Madam Soong visited Cuiheng, returned to Sun Yat-sen's former residence to pay respects, and inspected the Sun Yat-sen Memorial School, giving detailed instructions on the school's reforms.</p>
<h3>Tang Sai's Songstress Competition - Queen Competition Scheduled for Tonight</h3>
<p>The China Youth Ambulance Corps, in order to raise funds to aid wounded soldiers and refugees, had previously obtained the consent of the Tang Sai songstresses to hold a charity performance on the 21st of this month. The Corps also decided to hold a competition for the charity singers, with the highest achiever to be crowned as the "Queen of the Singers". This matter has been reported in the newspapers. The competition will now be held tonight (the 14th). The award ceremony is scheduled to be held next Saturday and Sunday at Tao Yuan in Shek Tong Tsui. Madam He Xiangning, wife of Liao Zhongkai, has been invited to give a speech of encouragement, and Madam He Bao-fang, wife of Wu Chao-chu, will present the awards.</p>
<h3>Philippine Authorities Deny Quarantine Certificates from Hong Kong and Shanghai Doctors - Due to Bad Apples in Shanghai Issuing False Certificates - Rumors of False Certificates in Hong Kong Under Investigation</h3>
<p>The Philippine authorities recently announced that Shanghai and Hong Kong were plague and cholera infected ports. Passengers from Hong Kong and Shanghai arriving at the Philippine Islands were required to present a doctor's certificate, proving that they had been vaccinated against smallpox and cholera. However, the Manila authorities suddenly refused to recognize doctors' certificates. It turned out that thirteen bad doctors in Shanghai were discovered by the Shanghai Municipal Council for issuing false certificates, and their licenses were revoked. At the same time, according to reports, similar cases were also occurring in Hong Kong. Therefore, the Philippine authorities recently refused to recognize certificates from doctors in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The reporter, concerned about the reputation of the medical community, interviewed Mr. Situ Yongjue, the Director of Medical and Health Services of Hong Kong, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to him, the authorities have decided to investigate the matter of registered doctors in Hong Kong issuing false certificates. The cholera epidemic in Hong Kong has been eradicated. It is expected that the Philippine authorities will also lift the ban. Regarding the Shanghai doctors' issuing of false certificates, Hong Kong is also somewhat aware of it, so the certificates recognized in Hong Kong are limited to those issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council or the French Concession authorities. The reporter also visited Mr. Shi Daheng, the secretary of the Hong Kong branch of the British Medical Association, who said that he had not heard of any Hong Kong doctors issuing false certificates.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Department Tested Incendiary Bomb Effectiveness Yesterday - Only Three of Ten Bombs Exploded</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong Air Defense Department tested incendiary bombs at the Volunteer Defense Corps Headquarters. Mr. Steel and Parker, the Director of Air Defense, gave instructions on how to extinguish them to members of the Women's Air Raid Precautions. A total of ten incendiary bombs were thrown, but only three exploded, achieving an effectiveness rate of only 17%. The degree of danger was not as deep as we imagined. When the first bomb exploded, the gardener tried to put it out with a hose, but it was ineffective. It was like adding fuel to the fire, making the flames even fiercer. Later, they switched to spraying with chemicals, and the flames gradually weakened. Finally, Parker managed to detonate the remaining seven bombs, but only one was successful. They were later extinguished with sandbags.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Spreads - Residents Should Get Vaccinated Immediately</h3>
<p>Last year, there was a smallpox epidemic in Hong Kong, with as many as 2,327 cases, and 1,811 deaths, meaning that the fatality rate was over three-quarters. Infants and children were particularly affected, accounting for about three-fifths of the cases. Those who survived often lost their sight or had pockmarked faces. Yesterday morning, Mr. Situ Yongjue, the Director of Medical and Health Services, issued a notice urging residents to get vaccinated immediately. Given that many refugees coming to Hong Kong are from areas where smallpox is prevalent, and that there have been many cases of smallpox in Shanghai, if it spreads to Hong Kong, with its current dense population, the consequences would be disastrous. Although vaccinations have been actively carried out in the past few months, there are still occasional cases, and it has not been eradicated. Therefore, for their own health, residents who have not been vaccinated in the past three years should get vaccinated immediately, especially children. All public hospitals and clinics offer free vaccinations. In addition, there are also free vaccination sites at the Port Health Office (11 Ice House Street) and the Marine Department (Connaught Road).</p>
<h3>Ye Duanren Murder Case - Chamber of Commerce Cables Guangdong Provincial Government - Strictly Punish the Culprits - Rectify Law and Order During the War of Resistance - Protect Service Personnel of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The case of Ye Duanren (Guobin), the leader of the Hong Kong Xijiang Seven Counties Association's Home Service Corps, who was looted and killed by the garrison security team during the first bombing of Xinxing City on November 26 last year, caused a sensation in Xinxing. It was widely known and deeply mourned by all sectors of Hong Kong society. However, due to the chaotic local situation at the time, the culprits were able to escape justice, leaving a major stain on the War of Resistance. Ye Duanren, originally named Guobin, was from Xinxing City West Street, 29 years old, and worked as an editor for the Dadao, Shenghuo, and Dazhong newspapers in Hong Kong for many years. He wrote extensively and devoted himself to various forms of literary propaganda after the July 7th Incident. In May last year, he organized the Xijiang Seven Counties Association's Home Service Corps and returned to Gaoyao, Yunfu, Luoding and other places to promote the War of Resistance and serve the local area. In September, the Yunfu County Command appointed him as a political instructor in the county's defense regiment. In mid-November last year, he returned to Xinxing on official business. During the bombing of the county seat by the Japanese aircraft, Ye fled to the outskirts and was robbed by the illegal security team of 113 unit. They took advantage of the chaos caused by the bombing to loot his property and then shot him to death to silence him, with two bullets hitting the back of his head. The case has been reported to the provincial government, the Pacification Headquarters, the military control zone and other authorities by the victim's wife, Ye Peng. It is said that the main culprit in the case was the squad leader of the security team, and he has been detained by the officer in charge and sentenced to imprisonment in the Xinxing County Prison. The Hong Kong Chinese Arts Association, the Seven Counties Association, the Xinxing Chamber of Commerce and other organizations recently held a memorial service to console the loyal soul. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also believes that this case, in which a service worker was killed by the national army during the War of Resistance, is a major issue concerning military discipline and the national interest during the War of Resistance, as well as the safety of service personnel in the future. Therefore, it sent a telegram to Chairman Li Hanhun of the Provincial Government, urging him to severely punish the culprits, provide compensation to the victim's family, and protect the safety of service personnel of overseas Chinese in the future. The original telegram from Li Xingqu, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to General Li Hanhun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and commander of the Provincial Security Headquarters, is as follows: "Chairman Li, the Guangdong Provincial Government, commander of the Provincial Security Headquarters, Xijiang Seven Counties Home Service Corps leader Ye Duanren (Guobin) was looted and killed by the illegal security team of 12 unit when Japanese aircraft bombed Xinxing City on November 26 last year. It is heard that the main culprit has been detained in the county prison. Please strictly punish the culprits, provide compensation, and protect the safety of service personnel of overseas Chinese. Li Xingqu, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. (13) Seal."</p>

<h3>Giving Money, Giving Strength, Giving Life to Rescue the Motherland! - The Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Service Group - The First Batch Returned to Vietnam for Replacements, the Second Batch Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese love their motherland deeply, especially the young overseas Chinese, who have a high degree of awareness and fiery enthusiasm. Their enthusiasm for donating money and returning to serve the country is simply like a "frenzy", like a surging tide. What the reporter wants to report here is another force that just arrived in Hong Kong from Vietnam yesterday.</p>
<p>Originally, the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Youth Scout Battlefield Service Group, more than 50 people, returned to the motherland with full enthusiasm to serve. Following the orders of the government, they were sent to work in Huizhou. They showed remarkable achievements in protection, rescue, propaganda, and promoting cooperation between the army and the people. When the reporter was in Huizhou, he admired their enthusiasm and efforts. Until the fall of Huiyang, the group continued to work bravely under fire, resulting in huge losses. According to reliable reports, four members bravely sacrificed themselves on the battlefield, and five or six are missing. Later, the team traveled through Luozengcheng and Conghua to Yingde, where they served in a wounded soldier reception center for a considerable period. Subsequently, they worked in Heyuan. Due to the unfamiliar environment, many members of the group fell ill. At the same time, various materials needed to be replenished, so they requested permission to return to Vietnam for reorganization and replenishment. They arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou a few days ago and received the concern and condolences of the local overseas Chinese. The country has decided to take a ship to Vietnam tomorrow for reorganization and replenishment, and then return to the country to serve.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 pm, the Hong Kong Calligraphy and Painting Literary Society, the Hong Kong Groups and Societies Eye Disaster Joint Assembly, the Chinese Arts Advancement Association, the Printing Industry Workers Union, the Winery and Teahouse General Union, and more than a dozen other groups held a farewell meeting at the Great Eastern Hotel to express their respect and encourage them to come. Just as their first batch was temporarily leaving the motherland tomorrow, the second batch of young service members arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and joined the embrace of the motherland.</p>
<p>According to the team leader, Mr. Lin Yin, "Although the first home service group suffered great losses in the East River, the overseas Chinese and youths in Annam are still reuniing in Annam with the spirit of perseverence, a total of 100 members in four squads, and raising a variety of rescue and medicines for the rescue of wounded soldiers and refugees." Hearing this, the reporter was deeply moved. Overseas Chinese are not only giving money to rescue the motherland, but also giving strength, and even sacrificing their lives. With such descendants, the Chinese nation has a symbol of a bright future, which no one can deny.</p>
<p>Team Leader Lin continued: "This time, we took the carp gate wheel from Saigon to Hong Kong, which is the fourth and fifth squadrons of the second brigade, a total of 40 people. The fifth squadron is led by Mr. Ying Xue Nian, and is currently staying in Hong Kong to receive a short period of rescue training. After the sixth and seventh squadrons of the group and various rescue drugs arrive in Hong Kong, the entire group will set off for a war zone to serve. The commander of a certain war zone has been telegraphed to request instructions, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and various overseas Chinese groups have been sent letters to provide guidance and assistance. This is naturally news that the overseas Chinese are happy to hear.</p>
<p>The reporter asked how the death of some members of the first batch of members in the East River, who were martyred for the country, had affected the second batch's arrival to serve the motherland this time. Team Leader Lin said: "The martyrdom of the troupe of Chang naturally aroused the respect of the overseas Chinese, and a memorial service will be held to comfort the loyal soul. However, the overseas Chinese are not afraid of death. The young people who return to the country to serve are still sincere and without concern, and their parents also allow them to win glory for the country. Hearing this, the reporter was almost moved to tears.</p>
<p>The reporter asked about the latest thoughts of the overseas Chinese on the motherland? Team Leader Lin replied: "We are of course infinitely indignant about the military and political leaders who have failed in their duties and the rebellion of Wang Jingwei, but we are increasingly determined and active in supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's resistance to the end. These few words are indeed the unanimous call of the vast number of overseas Chinese. I don't know what face Wang Jingwei and the other traitors who are disloyal to the War of Resistance and disloyal to the country and nation have to see the overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>Team Leader Lin was very busy because he had just unloaded his luggage, so the reporter did not dare to disturb him too much. After agreeing on a time for the next conversation, he said goodbye.</p>
<h3>Savior of Refugees - Father Rhawe Departs for Shanghai Yesterday - Deeply Convinced That Our Country Will Win the Final Victory</h3>
<p>Father Rhawe, known as the "Savior of Refugees", has been in Hong Kong for several days since flying from Chongqing. All the matters he handled have been arranged. He took the Italian postal ship Victoria to return to Shanghai yesterday. Many people went to the ship to see him off. Father Rhawe met with reporters on the ship and told them about his visit to Chongqing to meet with our country's authorities. He expressed his deep admiration for the vigor of our people and the bravery of our soldiers, and he was deeply convinced that our country would win the final victory.</p>
<h3>The Two New Artistic Creations of the Chinese Amateur School - Zhong Ming - The Chinese Amateur Drama Troupe and Choir</h3>
<p>【Special Report】 In the last two months, an extraordinary force has emerged in the Hong Kong education circle, leading the historically commercialized, silent, and stereotyped Hong Kong and Kowloon education to a bright and brilliant new direction. This extraordinary force is the Chinese Amateur School that has recently emerged in Hong Kong's cultural circles. It has become the first choice for many aspiring people who feel regret because there are no other options for those wanting to study part-time. This is naturally due to the small size of the school, but it can also be seen that the community feels the need for this school.</p>
<p>After more than a month of operation, the amateur school, under the principle of "collective pursuit of progress" promoted by the organizers, the members quickly organized several research units to carry out collective research and cultural creation work, such as the Literary Research Society, the Journalism Research Association, the Science Research Association, and the Political and Economic Research Association, which are all actively intensifying their work. In addition to these, there are also two "new creations" worth introducing to readers—two artistic organizations. These two organizations are the Chinese Amateur Drama Troupe and the Chinese Amateur Choir. They were established only a month ago and are about to perform. Although the results may not necessarily reach the ideal, as everyone likes, it is an amazing move to dare to schedule a public concert after such a short organization time.</p>
<p>Regarding their drama troupe, the members may have some experience in theater, but under the guidance of their instructors Ouyang Yuqian, Lu Dun, Li Chen and other theater seniors, they have recently invited Mr. Tang Huaiqiu, a pioneer of "China Tourism", to guide the performance, and the results will definitely be considerable, which is no accident.</p>
<p>Regarding their choir, it is directed and trained by Mr. Cai Zixin, who previously organized the "Trio" with Mr. Chen Hong, the current director of academic affairs of the National Conservatory of Music in Guangzhou, to promote the new music movement and has performed for many years. With the help of Ms. Chen Zhuanyi, a rising star in female vocals, the results are also very outstanding. When I visited their training, it was not much less than many choirs that had been training for a long time. When the Wuhan Choir performed in Hong Kong, they did not pay much attention to the male bass. According to Mr. Cai, it was like building a house with an unstable foundation. Therefore, their male bass is very strong. There are more than 40 members in their entire group, only two-thirds of whom are students of the amateur school, and the others are comrades outside who are knowledgeable in music, so their strength is quite strong. If they can continue to work hard, there is great hope.</p>
<p>Recently, because the members of the amateur school felt that there was no public library suitable for the public, they felt that it was necessary to build one quickly. Therefore, these two new creations of artistic work have taken on the mission of pioneer and decided to perform their debut on the morning of the 15th of this month (Sunday) at 10:00 am at the Ping An Theater on Nathan Road in Kowloon. Those who are interested in seeking welfare for the community and overseas Chinese should enthusiastically support them. At the same time, we can also see how these two new creations perform on stage?</p>
<h3>Governor of Hong Kong Held a Review of the Volunteer Defense Corps Yesterday - And Awarded Medals of Merit</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 pm, the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Corps held a review and award ceremony at the headquarters parade ground. More than a hundred Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen attended to watch the ceremony. The troops gathered in formation at 5:30 pm. At 5:45 pm, the Governor and his wife, accompanied by the military attaché, arrived and were welcomed by the commander of the corps. They then went to the parade ground for the review, awarded medals of merit to ten people, and delivered a speech, praising the winners and expressing their earnest expectations for the Volunteer Defense Corps. The Governor particularly praised the newly established Chinese team and expressed the hope that more Chinese would enthusiastically join. The Governor said that the corps' camping exercise at the end of last year was very successful and worthy of celebration. Finally, a cocktail party was held.</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>The Drum Mountain of Fuzhou (4)</h3>
<p>— Shao Yanqing</p>
<p>Descending from White Cloud Cave, one can reach the northern foot of Drum Mountain. Scenic spots such as Heavenly Ladder and Dragon's Backbone Path are precariously steep. In addition, there are scenic sites such as Buddha Head Rock, Cloud Screen, Roaring Thunder Gorge, Sun and Moon Lake, and Three Heavenly Gates, as well as the various monasteries of Buddhist and Taoist sanctuaries nestled among verdant scenery, all worth seeing. Generally, those skilled in mountain climbing who ascend from the southern foot of Drum Mountain often descend from here. Unfortunately, our clothing and belongings were deposited at Yongquan Temple on the southern side, so we had to return to the temple, thus missing this exciting path and the precipitous mountain scenery, which was somewhat regrettable.</p>
<p>The return journey to Yongquan Temple was a mountain path filled with hazy light and azure hues. Compared to the towering and expansive mountain scenery just now, it felt like entering a different realm altogether. Every grass, every tree, the red leaves, the green mountains, all seemed to reflect into a painting. Along the way, the various scenes were very closely matched, so that one did not feel bored for a moment. Rolling hills and groves of pine and cypress were scattered everywhere. After a few turns, one suddenly arrived at the top of a cliff, looking down into the deep valley below, where a large rock lay prostrate, making one aware of the greatness and silence of nature. Sometimes, as the path wound around, a secluded and picturesque scene suddenly unfolded before one's eyes. Below on the hillside were plots of emerald green fields, terraced along the slope, and a water channel flowing to Yongquan Temple. The channel was constantly filled with spring water secreted from the rock strata. It was enough to pause here, listen to the tinkling water sounds, and gaze at the rippling stream for a while to dispel myriad worldly worries.</p>
<p>Arriving at Yongquan Temple, the sun was already setting. In the main hall, a hundred or so monks were conducting their evening service, each draped in a gray monastic robe, with wide sleeves and large cuffs, prostrating and bowing. Their movements were slow, deliberate, and unhurried, mumbling scriptures that were unintelligible, the tone low, slow, and solemn. At this time, the sounds of the wooden fish and chimes rose and fell in response, adding to the sense of stillness and reverence. We stood outside the door, watching until they circled behind the Buddha, before leaving the main hall in a long and drawn-out "Ah – Mi – Tuo – Fo –" sound.</p>
<p>Staying in the temple for another night, the fatigue of the whole day was restored after a night of sound sleep. The next morning, we got up to tour the various halls and buildings within the temple. It turned out that the scale of this temple was very grand. There were three mountain gates in total. On the third mountain gate was inscribed the four characters "Sea Heaven Supporting Pillar" by the late provincial government chairman Fang Shengtao. The main complex of the temple had three courtyards. The first courtyard was the Hall of Heavenly Kings, the second was the Great Hero Hall, and the third was the Dharma Hall. Except for the Hall of Heavenly Kings in the front, the halls in the two rear courtyards were all tall and spacious. In front of each courtyard was a square paved with white stones. To the right of the main complex were the Sutra Repository Tower, the Precious Seal Granary, the Precept Hall, a meditation hall, the abbot's room, the Hall of Longevity, the Buddhist Academy, and the Buddhist Hospital, etc. To the left were the Bell Tower, the Ksitigarbha Hall, the Sutra Storage Hall, the Hall of the Ancestral Masters, the Incense Accumulation Hall, the Dining Hall, the storeroom, and the rice milling place, etc. Adding a few houses for accommodating visiting laypersons, the organizational aspect seemed even more complete than a small village.</p>
<p>In front of the temple, there were also large vegetable gardens and flower gardens, a deep green release pond, and two newly built structures standing side by side. One was a red and green building, built high on a pile of stones more than two zhang tall. Viewed from below, it had the feeling of a fortress. It was said that this was the private villa of the former Minister of the Navy, Yang Shuzhuang. The other residence was called "Returning Dragon Pavilion," which was a building as spacious as a school building. It was unknown which benefactor built it. These two new buildings added a touch of vibrant vitality to this ancient temple. In addition, in front of the first courtyard, there was also a small pool of water, directly facing the main complex of the temple. The pool was called "Arhat Spring." Spring water welled up in the pool, never ceasing throughout the year. The name "Yongquan Temple" (Gushing Spring Temple) originated from this.</p>
<p>Going out through a small stone door in the southeast corner of the temple, and then descending dozens of stone steps, one entered a narrow space between two cliffs. At the end of this area, there was a monk's abode built of wooden planks. A small stone bridge spanned in front of the building, leading directly to the Lingyuan Spring. It was said that when National Master Xingyan preached here, he disliked the sound of the water flowing under the bridge and shouted at it, whereupon the spring water immediately dried up. Therefore, later generations called it "Drinking Water Rock." Of course, this was just a baseless fabrication, not to be trusted. Going higher from here, there was a rocky mountain path covered with fallen leaves, and the path could lead to the Zhu Xi Shrine. Before reaching the Zhu Xi Shrine, one had to pass through a temple. Inside was a pool of water, with a waterwheel like a winch installed below the pool. Every few minutes, when the water in the compartments around the wheel flowed out, the waterwheel would move a little, thus pulling a iron hammer to strike the bell with a "clang." It was said that after the spring water at Drinking Water Rock was drunk dry by National Master Xingyan, it was diverted to here. In fact, the most secluded and beautiful place of Drinking Water Rock was still below. One only needed to descend dozens of stone steps to see the towering cliffs on both sides and the dense forest. Supported by the branches and leaves in the middle, there was a stone houseboat. Not far from the houseboat, there was also a water sprayer, constantly spraying out beads of water like a white silk. Standing here, listening to the lonely and dripping sound of water for a while, it was no different from being in a secluded paradise.</p>
<p>After visiting Drinking Water Rock, we went on to see the Release Garden, the Transformation Kiln, the Arhat Terrace, the Sea Assembly Pagoda, the Arhat Footprint, and the Taiyi Cave. As soon as our feet stepped to the entrance of the Release Garden, a stench of livestock assaulted our noses, almost making it impossible to breathe. This garden was a two-story building enclosing a rectangular courtyard. The bottom floor was surrounded by wooden bars, used to raise the released birds and animals. Looking in through the wooden bars, there was hardly a clean spot. Feed and manure were piled all over the ground. The pigsty for white pigs was even more of a mess, with the white hair almost turning black. In my opinion, although the birds and animals here were spared the death penalty, it was no different from being sentenced to life imprisonment. I thought, "When the opportunity arises," the monks might as well visit zoos in various places to learn some management methods. Otherwise, wouldn't they lose the true meaning of releasing life?</p>
<p>The Arhat Terrace, the Transformation Kiln, and the Sea Assembly Pagoda were not particularly interesting. The Arhat Terrace looked like a base where the Arhats gave sermons. The Transformation Kiln resembled a police sentry box, with a square in front where people stood to watch cremations. The ashes of the cremated bodies were buried in the Sea Assembly Pagoda. It was said that the pagoda was built in the third year of the Daguan era of the Song Dynasty, more than 800 years ago. It was estimated that the ashes of monks and nuns buried in it numbered no less than ten thousand.</p>
<p>The distance from the Sea Assembly Pagoda to the Arhat Footprint was only across a main road. After walking not far, one passed through a farm path full of tall weeds, and saw a few scattered low trees, swaying in the wind. The dancing shadows of the trees were projected onto a gray and dim rock. Here, three footprints slightly larger than ordinary people's were deeply imprinted. Compared with the footprints at "Guanyin Jump" on Mount Putuo, they seemed even smaller. Could it be that the Arhat was not as tall as Guanyin? It can be seen that these were all creations of later generations to deceive the ignorant people. Jumping up along the direction of the footprints, one could see another large rock. The top of the rock was flat, about three or four zhang long and wide, enough to accommodate several tables for a banquet.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Create the China Aviation Company, exclusively controlling China's civil aviation rights, and excluding Chinese and foreign joint ventures in the aviation industry.</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] According to reliable sources from the Chinese side, the "China Aviation Company" to be created by the Japanese intends to implement passenger and postal services in various occupied areas. Their intentions are threefold: (1) to monopolize China's private aviation rights, (2) to attempt to exclude Chinese and foreign joint ventures in civil aviation, and (3) The total capital is 50 million Japanese yen, with 6 million yen allocated for start-up costs. The Japan Air Transport Society plans to invest 25 million Japanese yen, and the puppet governments of Beijing and Nanjing will each invest 10 million Japanese yen. The Mengjiang "Autonomous Government" will invest one million yen, and the remaining four million yen will be raised separately. The Japanese Army and Navy, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, and pro-Japanese elements are currently discussing this matter with the Asia Development Board in Tokyo. Progress is smooth, and once formally approved by the "Asia Development Board," it will soon open.</p>

<h3>Brief News from Ningbo</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Gambling and Opium in Fishing Areas; Jinhua-Ningbo Through Traffic Opens</p>
<p>Ningbo Dispatch: Xu Zhen, commissioner and security commander of the Sixth District of Zhejiang Province, considers the Zhoushan Islands to be the leading of China's four major fishing areas. However, every fishing season, when fishermen gather, there are often loafers and ruffians who run brothels, set up gambling dens, and sell opium and drugs, tempting fishermen. This kind of evil wind causes great harm to the people. Now that the fishing season has arrived and the war of resistance is in full swing, it is imperative to strictly investigate and prohibit these activities. A special order has been issued to the magistrate of Dinghai County to strictly order his subordinates to investigate and prohibit them, either by personally suppressing them or by sending personnel to be stationed for defense, in order to eliminate the bad elements and pacify the good people, and to eradicate the decadent customs. The commissioner's office will also send personnel to inspect and investigate at any time.</p>
<p>Jinhua and Ningbo through-traffic buses: The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation has planned and decided that the Provincial Highway Bureau and the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company will jointly operate the service. All preparations have been completed, and the service will officially commence on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Returning from Changsha (4)</h3>
<p>— Lü Dongren</p>
<p>Hanoi is a prosperous metropolis in Annam. The local construction and commercial prosperity are no less than Saigon, where we had been. There are very few overseas Chinese here, so many businesses are occupied by the local natives. The local natives have gradually learned to do business over the long years. We believe that in the near future, overseas Chinese in various foreign countries will have no foothold. Mr. Yang, who had been helping us, was about to part ways with us to go to Yunnan. When we arrived in Hanoi, we were about to repay him for the loans he had given us, so we wired Saigon as soon as we arrived to have the money remitted. We returned the money borrowed from Mr. Yang and thanked him. Mr. Yang said goodbye to us on the morning of the third day and left. We thought back to the generous assistance Mr. Yang had given us, but now we were far apart, which not only made us feel very lonely in spirit, but also made me wonder when we would be able to repay him. Because there were no ships going to Hong Kong yet, we stayed for several days. During these days, we happened to encounter the opening of a commodity exhibition. We strolled there for two nights, and the displays inside were dazzling, and the visitors did not decrease day or night. It was an annual grand event for the major commercial ports of Annam. On the evening of the sixth day, we took the train to Haiphong, and that night we boarded the Duobao ship. We set sail at 9:00 PM. We were in third class, which cost ten national currency, including meals. Haiphong is adjacent to the sea, hence the name "Haiphong." The place is not very big, but it is quiet and pleasant to live in. There are very few overseas Chinese. Before disembarking, we had to take our passports to the police for signature and also get a certificate of vaccination from the hospital. There were many Annamese people on the ship going to Guangzhou Bay to seek employment. To avoid seasickness, we dared not put any food in our stomachs, only ate a little bread. Because I rarely traveled by boat, when the wind and waves were big, I vomited several times, but Mr. Li did not vomit once. On the evening of the second day, we arrived at Guangzhou Bay. The ship was docked not far from the shore, but this was only a stay of a few hours. Because we wanted to see what Guangzhou Bay was like, we hired a small boat for four cents of Hong Kong currency to go ashore for a stroll. It was only a very small city, with only three or four prosperous streets. Because we were very hungry, we went to a coffee shop, drank two cups of milk, and ate a few biscuits before we perked up a bit. The cheapest fruit here was oranges. We ate several of them. Guangzhou Bay is a French concession, so all government affairs are handled by the French, but business is controlled by the Chinese. The currencies used here include national currency, Hong Kong currency, and Vietnamese currency. Because we were only staying for a few hours and it was at night, we did not know much about the other scenery and circumstances. Many passengers boarded the ship from Guangzhou Bay to go to Hong Kong. Most of the people coming from here were refugees fleeing from the war zone. There was a revolutionary comrade named Zhang, and it so happened that his berth was not far from us, so we started talking. We learned that he was a staff member of the Army's ×× Division's office in Hengyang. This time, he had rushed from Hankou to Hong Kong to find his family. Since the abandonment of Guangzhou, he did not know where his parents and wife had fled to or if they had died under the enemy's swords. Alas, I believe that the pain in Mr. Zhang's heart was something we could not express. Mr. Zhang resolutely told us that if his family had really met with misfortune, he would definitely join the air force and fight to the death with ×× to die for his country. In this vast sea, we were tossed for four days before safely arriving in Hong Kong at noon on the 20th.</p>
<p>The duration of our trip was a full thirty-seven days. We are ashamed of our lack of military rescue and other talents to do our bit for the country. Although we may not be able to reach our destination today, we vow to redouble our efforts from today onwards to fulfill our responsibilities as young people of this great era. (The End)</p>
<h3>The Pain of National Subjugation! Two Hundred and Fifty Jews Take the Victoria Ship Passing Through Hong Kong to Shanghai; Anxious about life after arriving in Shanghai, shouldn't we also be sensitive to this?</h3>
<p>(Exclusive Interview) With the daily escalation of Jewish persecution in Germany, the Jews in Germany are enduring the pain of exile. Several batches have already gone to Shanghai in previous months. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Italian mail ship Victoria arrived in Hong Kong from Europe. This reporter boarded the ship to investigate and learned that this time it carried 250 Jews, who will continue to Shanghai. These people were all haggard and their condition was very pitiful. The reporter asked a Jew what they would do after arriving in Shanghai. The Jew sighed and replied, "In this oppressive environment, I have nothing to say. Even if we arrive in Shanghai, the problem of livelihood will still be very worrying." He then wept under his breath. Later, I saw three or four Jewish women and children with tears in their eyes. The pain of national subjugation is such. The ship then left Hong Kong at 2:00 PM to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Stock Market Lacks Vitality in the Past Week; Trading Volume Insignificant; No Improvement Yesterday</h3>
<p>As of yesterday (3:30 PM), the Hong Kong stock market has lacked vitality over the past week. Although the market was generally stable, the total trading volume was insignificant. Due to the influence of the volatile global political situation in recent days, buyers have generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude, while sellers have also remained calm and unwilling to sell. With both sides taking a cautious approach to the market, it is no wonder that the market is so sluggish. After HSBC announced a dividend of three pounds, buying surged on that day (the 11th), and the price rose by thirty dollars compared to the previous day. However, the trading volume was small, and the price had already fallen back by twenty dollars the next day, further dropping back to one thousand four hundred dollars yesterday. Yesterday, the performance of various stocks was even more stagnant. Although the selling was active, buyers showed no intention to absorb it. The following is a record of the highest and lowest prices of various stocks in the past week, as well as the closing bids and offers yesterday:</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Championship Battle: Tonight, Mei Fong Meets Pui To; Victory Secures the Title. Whose Daughter Will Have Good Fortune? A Rare Spectacle, Come Early.</h3>
<p>(Our Special Correspondent) A constitutional opening, a spirit cooled, a narrow room with high heat. Tonight, if you go to the YMCA, you will surely see such poetic beauty.</p>
<p>The Women's Basketball League, which has turned many troubles into nothing, reaches its final stage to decide the championship tonight. Mei Fong hopes to realize their dream again (Mei Fong won the previous championship), while Pui To also wants to forge a good bond. Therefore, at this auspicious time to choose a champion, let's see which daughter will have good fortune.</p>
<p>Mei Fong and Pui To have not tasted defeat in their past matches, remaining flawless. They have both accumulated many achievements.</p>
<p>This meeting is to compete for first place, a winner-takes-all situation, how important! Tell the fans, do not miss tonight.</p>
<p>Mei Fong's three forwards are most loved for their triangular rotating offense, which is fast and well-coordinated. Any defender will have a headache when facing it. In addition, Ye Meilian's reverse layup and Lu Huixian's side shot are unique. It is unknown how Pui To's three guards will cope.</p>
<p>Pui To's Xu Yinghua and Liu Tuyin are also outstanding frontline players, with naturally skilled hands. It is believed that they will also cause a storm in Mei Fong's defense.</p>
<p>Speaking of the team's overall cooperation, Mei Fong seems to be slightly better. However, in such an important match, it still depends on whether the players' performance attitude is abnormal before their success or failure can be determined. Because sometimes being too excited can be detrimental.</p>
<p>Liu Qianying is a former Mei Fong player and is now a pillar of Pui To's defense. Therefore, although she has been away from her former team for a long time, she is still familiar with the inside story. Do not think that because of her deep connection, she will give them a break. You must know that today everyone serves their own master.</p>
<p>Mei Fong's Wu Huan Ying is also fierce enough. Although a woman, she does not yield to men. Sitting in the forbidden city, she boasts of her ape-like agility. Such a good show is rare to see. Please arrive early to avoid being turned away. Also, there is a small program between Si Si and the University of Hong Kong before the main event, but there is nothing much to say. In my opinion, the University of Hong Kong will definitely win. (Courtside Old Friend)</p>
<p>Match Schedule</p>
<p>First Match 6:30 PM Si Si vs. University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Second Match 7:30 PM Mei Fong vs. Pui To</p>
<p>Four Teams of Female Players</p>
<p>(Mei Fong Team) Chen Huiqing, Wu Huan Ying, Ye Meilian, Huang Baozhen, Wu Xiaoying, Chen Yuemei, Lu Huixian, Liang Yemei, Xu Fengyi, Sun Yuming, Liang Yufang, Qiu Bingtang.</p>
<p>(Pui To Team) Pan Xiaoshao, Xu Yinghua, Liu Qianying, Zhang Huazheng, Luo Shaoxi, Zhao Mingzheng, Liu Yiji, Liu Meiyue, Guan Shuzhen, Liang Muzhen, Huang Fengzhen, Mai Renzeng.</p>
<p>(Si Si Team) Wang Huixian, Deng Huixin, Huang Lihe, Liang Hui, Wei Juan, Gao Shufen, Li Xiaoying, Huang Yan, Huang Qin芳, Li Yumei, Liang Shengwen, Wei Bao.</p>
<p>(University of Hong Kong Team) Li Huijuan, Huang Xiuxian, Shi Zongjie, You, Wang Zhaoxi, Hong Qizong, Huang Zhen, Zou Defan, Li Zongyu, Liang Wenhua, Yuan Wanxian, Jialian.</p>
<h3>School Basketball Awards Ceremony Yesterday; Paul's College Forfeits; Wah Nam College Wins Championship</h3>
<p>The inter-school basketball competition has concluded. The awards ceremony was held at the Lower Government Ground yesterday, the 13th, at 4:30 PM. The senior division was originally scheduled for a rematch between Paul's College and Wah Nam College due to their equal scores. This decision was made by the federation before the awards ceremony yesterday to determine the championship. Many spectators came, expecting a dramatic battle between the two teams for the championship. About a thousand people attended. However, when 4:30 PM arrived, referee Liu Deyi blew the whistle to gather the players from both sides to prepare for the game, but the players from Paul's College were nowhere to be seen. Only Wah Nam College was present. The referee then declared that Paul's College had forfeited, and Wah Nam College had won. However, to satisfy the audience's excitement, a team composed of junior Wah Yan College players was hastily assembled for an exhibition match. Subsequently, the Hong Kong-Guangdong Youth Military Service Corps, led by Deng Jin, arrived and sang several patriotic songs to boost the atmosphere. Afterwards, Zhao Ganlin, the deputy general secretary of the YMCA, briefly gave a speech before the awards ceremony. The Hong Kong champion Wah Nam team, the runner-up Paul's College team, the junior champion Wah Yan team, the Guangzhou champion Guangdong team, and the junior champion Culture team were each awarded a silver shield. Individual prizes can be collected at the YMCA today, the 14th.</p>
<h3>Cross-Country Race Officials Announced</h3>
<p>The alumni association of the Specialist School of Chinese Language in Shenzhen and the Chinese Language Training Section of China National Vocational School is organizing the first Hong Kong Chinese Open Cross-Country Race. The list of some officials was announced yesterday.

<h3>Lee Shek-yau Has Wings but Cannot Fly; Banned from Football Competition for the Rest of This Year; Can Only Re-Enlist on January 1st Next Year</h3>
<p>(Special Report) On New Year's Day this year, there was a scene of Chinese players competing for the special silver medal semi-final qualification, which left a particularly unpleasant impression. Those who witnessed it should still be able to vaguely recall it. In that dramatic match, after South China Football Club scored two goals first, Lam Tak-po and Hui King-shing collided, and Tak-po's right foot was seriously injured. Although he still勉强 continued to play, he could only run and not shoot for the rest of the game. Later, both sides had incidents of falling and minor injuries. When the match ended in a 2-2 draw, an extra 20 minutes was played to determine the winner. Because the players had been playing for too long, many suffered from cramps. The most unfortunate incident was when Lee Shek-yau and Toi Chi-tsan were competing for the ball, Lee suddenly jumped and kicked, the situation was tense. The referee, Ip Kau-ko, in accordance with the football regulations, exercised his power and ordered Lee to leave the field and not be allowed to play again.</p>
<p>According to football regulations, the referee should report the details of the incident to the relevant authority. Any disputes should be referred to the Special Affairs Committee for judgment. Therefore, after the match, referee Ip reported the reason for ordering Lee Shek-yau off the field to the Football Association, stating "dangerous kicking". After reviewing the report, the Football Association referred it to the Special Affairs Committee for handling. The committee held a hearing on the previous Friday, but because referee Ip Kau-ko was on leave, he was unable to appear to testify. Therefore, the hearing was postponed until yesterday, when Lee Shek-yau was summoned again. It was rumored that although Lee did not admit to intentionally committing the foul, the committee members believed that Lee did have a dangerous kicking act. After examining the records, they found that Lee had been warned in the previous season and was now a repeat offender. Therefore, he was severely punished with a one-year ban from competition from the date of the foul, until January 1st next year, after which he can re-register and apply to compete again.</p>
<p>Hong Kong football competitions often have disputes over players being sent off. The 1936-37 season was particularly bad for such incidents. However, in the previous season (1937-38), no first division players were banned from playing football, which was seen as a good sign of improvement in Hong Kong football. Unfortunately, this season began with the Scot player, Fleming, being sent off for punching someone at the Kowloon Stadium and being fined. Next, Metrovick's right inside forward, Cooney, was also sent off for punching Lee Kwok-wai and was suspended for two weeks. However, the offenses of those two were minor. Now, there is a third person being banned from playing. Lee Shek-yau has quick and fierce footwork and is a rare left-sided player. It is hoped that after this lesson, he will become more outstanding, not only studying football tactics and reducing dribbling, but also focusing on kicking the ball. Then, he can easily earn a good reputation and have a bright future. Do not lose heart over this matter. (Courtside Old Friend)</p>

<h3>Football League Today: Eastern Faces Kowloon Club; Kwong Wah vs. St. Joseph Postponed</h3>
<p>(Our Special Correspondent) The sports scene on the island is always active. Today, the football league alone is worth watching.</p>
<p>In the first division, although the Kwong Wah vs. St. Joseph match is postponed, there are still three matches to watch, especially the Eastern vs. Kowloon Club match.</p>
<p>Tsang Chor-chi, who was the captain of South China three years ago, has returned from overseas for a month. He recently joined Eastern. Coincidentally, Tsang Chung-wan is slightly ill, so Chor-chi will be playing today. It is said that he played as a center back overseas, which is more versatile than his previous position. After being away for many years, he has changed his style. Let's see how he performs.</p>
<p>Today, Kowloon Club is playing away from home, losing their home advantage. They should not be too aggressive. As long as the Eastern players work hard and perform well, they can subdue the dragon.</p>
<p>Lau Hin-hon's hand injury has healed, and he has regained his form. He will guard the goal and prevent evil spirits from entering.</p>
<p>Metrovick will play the Police Club. Logically, Metrovick should win. This match is also a farewell performance for Watson and Logan. There should be many good plays.</p>
<p>The navy team changes its lineup frequently, so its recent performance has not been as good as before. This is the effect of frequent personnel changes. However, today they are launching a major attack against the Hong Kong Club. The two teams are evenly matched, and the navy is likely to win. The lineups of Eastern and Kowloon Club and the match schedule are as follows: (Eastern Lang)</p>

<h3>Basketball Referees Association Held Annual Meeting Yesterday; Many Proposals Resolved</h3>
<p>The Basketball Referees Association held its annual meeting at the Luk Hoi Tung Restaurant at 7:00 PM last night. Many people attended. After Chairman Chung Chi-keung delivered the opening remarks, Kwok Kwok-tok reported on last year's finances, and Yeung Ho-wang reported on last year's affairs. Then, the discussion of revising the constitution began. Opinions were expressed during the meeting, and the proposals were passed. Subsequently, the election of advisors and committee members began. It was resolved to appoint several advisors. Five committee members were elected on the spot: Chung Chi-keung, Kwok Muk-hoi, Chan Yu-ching, Poon Yiu-kwan, and Leung Kwok-tok. However, Kwok Muk-hoi resigned due to serving multiple terms. It was eventually passed that the alternate member Yau Chi-ching would succeed him. Various opinions were expressed on the association's affairs. The meeting was adjourned after 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Movies and Theater</h3>
<p>Entertainment... The Little Lord Fauntleroy</p>
<p>Lord Jeff</p>
<p>It is an educational film that has greatly interested every parent and general child and youth.</p>
<p>Freddie Bartholomew, the child star who moved every audience in "David Copperfield", plays an orphan who has been spoiled and used by a pair of cunning con artists. They train him to pretend to be the son of a nobleman and swindle people everywhere. Later, he is arrested and sent to a school for juvenile delinquents, where he is forced to learn nautical skills. The story tells the life of him and a group of classmates like him. One of the classmates is played by the rough and cheerful child star Mickey Rooney. He has become a non-commissioned officer in the school. "The Little Lord Fauntleroy" is captured during a private escape, but later they become friends.</p>
<p>We still remember that these two child stars once collaborated in "Captains Courageous". Although they portray very different personalities, they have a complementary effect and are a very good match. Now they are a little older, and their acting skills have also become more mature, especially in portraying the personality of young people, which is vividly portrayed. In addition to an interesting story, and the sincere and enthusiastic performances of the children, the content of the film is enriched.</p>
<p>Queen's Theatre... Spawn of the North</p>
<p>Spawn of North</p>
<p>A film adapted from a famous literary work, depicting the life of the indigenous people on the Alaskan Peninsula in the northern border of the United States, in the Arctic Ocean. It is a major salmon producing area, but the fishermen who make a living by fishing must make great efforts to overcome all natural and man-made difficulties, such as icebergs floating on the sea and the rampant fishing pirates, to maintain their interests. In their lives full of joys, sorrows, loves and hates, there are many touching stories.</p>
<p>This film tells the story of two good friends. Because of the conflict of fishing interests, one cooperates with the fishing pirates, and the other stands on the side of the fishermen's self-defense group. Good friends become enemies. At the same time, behind them are women who love them deeply, helplessly watching them fight each other. Later, the one who cooperated with the pirates was finally injured and repented, deliberately sinking the pirate ship under an iceberg, perishing with the fishing pirates, sacrificing himself, and fulfilling his love for his friends, as the climax of the film.</p>
<p>The cinematography of this film is lively and ingenious. There are also several shots of Indian sacrificial ceremonies, which, in our opinion, are full of mysterious meaning. At the same time, this film has five stars, starring George Raft, Henry Fonda, and Dorothy Lamour, and co-starring Akim Tamiroff, John Barrymore, etc. The arrangement of the plot allows everyone to give full play to their artistic talents. Director Henry Hathaway, who has directed films such as "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" and "The Lives of a Bengal Lancer", has a strong power to manipulate the emotions of the audience in handling the plot and climax of this film.</p>
<p>Eastern... Little Tough Guy</p>
<p>Little Tough Guy</p>
<p>It is a group of little stars from a poor alley. The content of this film is similar to the former, and it is a good educational film. The performances are very hard.</p>
<p>Dahua... Tarzan's Revenge</p>
<p>Tarzan's Revenge</p>
<p>The story is mediocre, telling the story of an explorer who wants to capture white people and go deep into the uncivilized areas. The barbarian king colludes with the aborigines and wants to capture white women. Fortunately, Tarzan saves them. Later, the white woman falls in love with Tarzan and never returns.</p>
<p>The performance is not surprising at all, far less than the "Tarzan and His Mate" starring Glenn Morris and Maureen O'Sullivan.</p>
<p>King Sing... Anthony Adverse</p>
<p>Anthony Adverse</p>
<p>Starring Fredric March.</p>
<p>Central... Love's Great Blood and Tears</p>
<p>Mandarin Film</p>
<p>It is adapted from Ba Jin's original work. I remember that when Lianhua Film Company was flying the banner of "Revitalizing Domestic Films", it was once made into a silent film named "Love and Duty". This time, it was made into a sound film by Xinhua Film Company, and it was still directed by Wan Cang. It can be said that it is easy to do. The male lead is still played by Jin Yan, and the female lead and the remaining supporting roles are replaced by Yuan Meiyun and Mei Xi, among others.</p>
<p>To put the story simply, it is about writing a woman who struggles repeatedly in a feudal society and finally ends her life with self-sacrifice. In terms of performance, it can be said to be a satisfactory work. Many scenes of Yang Naifan and Li Zuyu's love are concise and moving. The emotions of Li running into walls everywhere after Yang eloped and finally dying are very strong. It is the opera "Lovely Mother" that is too long and ruins the mood of the whole play. Jin Yan, Yuan Meiyun, and Hai Xi all performed well.</p>
<p>New World... Spring Fever</p>
<p>Cantonese Film</p>
<p>This film tells the story of the dark side of a large hotel. The bizarre social ideas reveal the畸形 development of society. Watching it is very touching. This film is the first production of Justice Company, starring Kuang Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang.</p>

<h3>South China Football Team Achieves Three Victories</h3>
<p>The South China Athletic Association received good news from the front yesterday. In their second match in Saigon, the football team played against the Southern Police Team and won 5-1. Goal scorers were Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong with two goals each, and Chen Dehui with one goal.</p>
<h3>University of Washington Alumni Basketball Team Passes Through Hong Kong Yesterday on Their Way to the Philippines. Two Matches Will Be Played During Their Return Trip.</h3>
<p>The University of Washington Alumni Basketball Team is touring during their annual holiday, passing through Shanghai via Japan and arriving in Hong Kong yesterday. Due to limited time, they did not stay and continued to the Philippines on the same ship. It is reported that after arriving in Hong Kong, they arranged to play two matches with the Basketball Federation on their return trip next month on the 8th. The Federation has agreed, and the Youth Association Team, Star Team, and the Basketball Federation Team will compete against them. One-third of the proceeds from the matches will be donated to disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Far East Tennis Championship: Hong Kong Players All Eliminated. Xu Chengji's Absence Reduces the Spectacle. The Tournament Uses Hard Courts and Is Held at Night.</h3>
<p>The Far East Tennis Championship has already started last Saturday in Saigon. All Hong Kong players have been eliminated. In singles, Cai Shuishan lost to Hong (Annam) with scores of 2-6, 1-6, 6-1, 1-6; Situ Bi lost to Petre (France) with scores of 0-6, 0-6, 1-6. In doubles, Situ Bi and Cai Shuishan lost to Sanbao Aidu and Lai Ren (Batavia) with scores of 4-6, 0-6, 1-6. Kees (Hong Kong) and Xu (Annam) lost to Petre (France) and Mauvedi (Belgian) with scores of 1-6, 0-6, 2-6.</p>
<p>It is reported that many skilled players participated in this competition. The most outstanding is Petre, who is not only the current French champion but also the champion of Batavia and Annam. He is skilled at using bomb-like serves to suppress opponents, and his hand shots and net play are particularly impressive. Mauvedi, the former Belgian second division champion, is also good. Unfortunately, his backhand seems a bit weak. His and Petre's hope for winning the doubles championship is very high.</p>
<p>Before the competition, it was rumored that Xu Chengji, a Chinese Davis Cup tennis player, would participate, but it did not materialize. Local fans believed this reduced the spectacle.</p>
<p>This competition uses hard courts and is held at night. The players must run and fight under the lights. Hong Kong players who are used to hard courts may have a better performance, but the strong lights that do not shine far are inconvenient.</p>
<p>Philippine players Javia and Sanza, who previously performed in Hong Kong once, did not get good results. But this time in Saigon, they are used to hard courts and have achieved initial success, defeating Annam's Koshali and Zhuan with scores of 8-6, 6-1, 6-1.</p>

<h3>How to Choose Subjects</h3>
<p>— Ziqing</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we people who like to write always feel that we don't have a specific subject to write about and don't know where to start when we pick up a pen. In other words, we can't find a suitable 'subject'.</p>
<p>Yes, whether a work is valuable or not is closely related to the object of description - the subject matter - it can make people have a deep resonance after reading or describing it, so that the story written is as intimate as the reader's own story. This function depends on how you choose the subject matter. So, the question of 'How to Choose a Subject' should and must be placed before every author.</p>
<p>The first thing I think we need to understand when raising the issue of "selecting subjects" is to understand the resilience of the times and the environment. For example, in the current time of the War of Resistance, the subject matter we write about cannot be separated from various life depictions that benefit the "War of Resistance", otherwise, publishing it will be like a pile of waste paper to the reader, making the reader unable to deeply appreciate it, and even make people disgusted. Suppose we describe a story that is related to the War of Resistance, such as the life of soldiers on the front line, the rescue and propaganda work of patriotic young men and women active in various places, or the experiences of refugees in the rear and occupied areas, and the real depiction of the various vicious massacres and plunders of the invaders. As long as we apply these vivid subjects well, we can enable the general readers to get a sense of "reality" and a deep sympathy, and even inspire the readers to participate in various works that benefit the "War of Resistance". Therefore, a work that can make people deeply meaningful, first of all, we must pay attention to whether its subject matter is in line with the times.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we need to think about is not forgetting the "authenticity" of the story. Because just under this abstract awareness of conforming to the times, if we don't carefully measure the authenticity of the subject matter, this will not increase the value of the work. For example, to describe the refugees in the refugee camp, if you have not experienced the authenticity of the refugees' life, and only get fragmented news from third parties or various aspects, and you just pick up a pen and patch it together, it is simply a joke, and it will not have any impact on the facts. Therefore, to choose a subject, we have to pay attention to its authenticity.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to pay attention to how to organize this subject matter. Because the objective facts are reflected in the subjective consciousness, they are still fragmented stories. To link them into a systematic story, we have to organize them so that they are scientific, so that readers can get a deep impression and not spend too much time.</p>
<p>Dear writers, I have raised a few questions, hoping to become your reference when writing.</p>
<h3>"Prosperity Policy"</h3>
<p>— Sangzi</p>
<p>According to various reports: The culture that "those people" brought to us in the early days was: Robbery, xx, xx; their purpose was to establish a "new order", so they used this spirit of the Great Japanese Empire to destroy our "old" things as much as possible. However, as a result, they were greatly disappointed. A "new order" with "withered eyes and a land filled with stinky carrion" was indeed created for them, but at the same time, a large number of objects of exploitation and suppression were lost. This is a phenomenon that is far from what they originally wanted. Of course, they were unwilling to have this phenomenon, so they implemented the "both hard and soft" policy in the next stage.</p>
<p>The so-called "hard" policy is still the old set of: burning, robbing, xx, xx: However, in order to take care of the "soft" aspect, the means used seem to be a little more "civilized" than before. As for the so-called "soft" policy, it is simply playing tricks and deceiving people: However, the general "new traitors" under their wings use it as a basis for promoting the "Royal Way Paradise". Of course, as a result of the combination of hard and soft, they have achieved considerable success, but before long, they have obviously failed again. Not only has the so-called "inferior people" not been hooked, but even the so-called "good people" have gradually understood their role. They also know that the content of the deceptive policy they have implemented is not substantial, so they cannot win "people's hearts" and gain practical benefits. Therefore, they have renewed their tricks and used the "prosperity policy" to assist in the promotion of the deceptive policy.</p>
<p>The direction of the prosperity policy is to widely establish "opium shops", "clubhouses" and "brothels". They use the reasons of prospering the market and increasing tax revenue to instigate their minions to carry out the promotion. Those "new nobles" are able to get "kickbacks", so of course they work hard, so this policy has already achieved "full" "achievements". They are therefore very happy, thinking that this can not only obtain huge amounts of wealth and save them from poverty, but also create a "prosperous" "new order" and boast to the world.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession has a thriving population and abundant financial resources, which they look at with great envy. However, because the situation is special, it is inconvenient to intervene. Therefore, they have to display their prosperity policy in a corner of Western Shanghai, luring the general residents to pay them "prosperity" fees every day, and recently it has spread to Hongkou and Pudong.</p>
<p>The area around Shanghai is now surrounded by this prosperity policy that damages the physical strength of our nation, undermines the will of our nation, and destroys the ethics of our nation. People living in Shanghai should recognize the environment and maintain their integrity. If they die under the prosperity policy, they will not only let down their ancestors, but also let down themselves.</p>
<h3>Temptation</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>It is not easy to regenerate splendor in a stained soul; if there is, it is the color dyed by others: black, red, yellow…</p>
<p>The coloring brush is temptation. The handles of the coloring brushes are held by a group of long-haired devils.</p>
<p>The first, tempting devil, that is, the tempting angel, appeared. Like what Baudelaire described: "The curves of his body have the softness of the ancient Bakkhos; his big, sleepy eyes have a dark and hazy luster, like purple orchids after rain; his half-opened lips are like a hot stove emitting thick smoke." He came, came to the world, untied a belt from his waist, a brilliant snake, placed it on people's brains, and he, lightly exhaled a breath, as if saying: "I am the ghost of eroticism, you quickly lie down in the fragrant mist I spit out"—so, many people fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Then, a golden light, first flashed in the distance, and slowly rolled over. Ah, it is a fat devil, he is knocking on his big belly with a hard fist, making a long, sonorous sound; the sound spread out and disappeared in the faint moans of countless people; he then showed his sharp teeth and laughed wildly, like a fool laughing after being drunk; suddenly, he knocked on his big belly again, letting the sound tell people: "My money can give you anything, do you want it? Please kneel at my feet."--So, many people fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Finally, another fairy came.</p>
<p>He has a big horn, he can put your name in the horn and shout, so that everyone in every corner of the world can hear it. He has a strong body, arrogant eyeballs, and an invisible and intangible mouth: He has a fascinating charm that will make you as smooth as a glass mirror. However, this glass mirror needs another lamp to shine; this other lamp is in his hand.</p>
<p>The area of the earth is not small. Yes. But the lamp in his hand only has one light. He raises it high, shakes it, teases your heart, and pulls your bones, saying: "Do you want fame? If so, then put your body horizontally in front of me, and fall entirely on the glass."--So many people fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The tempting devil, that is, the tempting angel, is striding in every place. His fluttering clothes brush people's souls, and he has sweet saliva, sprinkled on people's faces: That is poison, is intoxicating wine. People are drunk, but still pretending to be awake, insisting: "I am not drunk--" Is that so? The devil laughed, haha, people fell for it. The erotic ghost tightens his belt: The money ghost knocks on his belly; The reputation ghost flashes the light; People are all obediently kneeling.</p>
<p>A gust of wind; a ray of light, cannot blow away the fog, cannot illuminate the darkness. The world is full of temptation, forever, forever...</p>
<h3>Unpaid Blood Debt</h3>
<p>— Du Wenhui</p>
<p>This is the end of midsummer in June. It is the season when the bright red face of lychees is shining on the branches. In this ancient city in the South! Guangzhou is becoming a dead city under the constant bombing of enemy planes.</p>
<p>Whether it is dawn or dusk, whether it is day or night, the terrifying and mournful air raid alarm is wailing far away. People's hearts also tremble and panic with a series of whirring sounds, running in all directions. However, when the alarm is lifted, people still run crowded on the road, and shops still open their doors for business. It seems that people have gained a kind of calm and steadfast experience in the months of bombing life. I often walk aimlessly in the corner or stand on the street to see the complexion of those passers-by and listen to the words of those passers-by during the alarm. They all have a heart of empathetic resonance and hatred for the enemy, they all have a solemn and patient face, and sometimes I hear the vulgar curses from the bottom of my heart leaking out, "Damn it, here they come again, damn Japanese." Many people have fled, and those who are left are prepared to die but can't bear to leave.</p>
<p>One morning, there was not a trace of sunlight in the sky, only the gloomy gray and pale clouds densely filled the sky. This sorrowful tone seemed to symbolize the fate of this city, as if it were a mourning dress draped over the top of Baiyun Mountain, draped over the turbid and turbulent Pearl River water, draped over the endless air-raid shelter colored houses, and draped over the hearts of every experienced citizen. This is another auspicious day for the enemy planes to patronize.</p>
<p>After the first air raid alarm, I dressed and walked on Yonghan Road. People on the street were bustling, rushing east and west. A series of chaotic leather shoe sounds seemed to be the beating hearts of every disaster-stricken person in this city. Especially those women; dragging the old and the young, calling out with pale faces.</p>
<p>"A-zhu, come here--where is grandma? Alas! Come here quickly"--They huddled together in groups, hiding in the sandbags under the arcade of the Columbus Restaurant. People were crowded. When I arrived there, there was no way to pass through. Those people were very selfish and refused to give up an inch of space. Death is what people fear the most! Especially death under the bombing of enemy planes; at this moment, I fully saw the selfishness and fear of death of human nature. The cries of children were noisy. People were cursing each other. The atmosphere of terror had already been created by these people themselves.</p>
<p>When I walked into a restaurant on Wenming Road, enemy planes had rushed into the city sky. They were flying very low, and the anti-aircraft guns were no longer effective. Anti-aircraft machine guns could not reach them either. Gray clouds were pressing low on the city sky; the rumbling of the enemy planes and the "boom boom" explosions from afar were vibrating people's eardrums. Police, young men, and soldiers came to maintain order on the road.</p>
<p>The rumbling sound of the planes suddenly appeared nearby. I hurriedly hid under a wooden bed in an arcade, where seven or eight people had already hidden. Everyone had a pale face and a throbbing and anxious heart.</p>
<p>"Shh--Lili--Boom--Bububu, bubububububu" Two bombs fell on Yonghan North Road. There, leaving a cloud of black smoke, gravel mixed with machine gun bullets danced on the road. The sulfurous smell suffocated our nostrils. Everyone closed their eyelids and waited for the arrival of death. The enemy planes were still circling overhead. After a while, they disappeared. From afar, I faintly heard several "boom boom" explosions. Only then did we open our eyes wide and take a breath. We looked at each other silently here.</p>
<p>A woman holding an infant and an old lady of sixty or seventy years old came to us. They had escaped from the disaster area. When the old lady ran to the place where we were hiding, she could no longer move, and died with her eyes wide open. She died of excessive panic. The woman was holding her and crying loudly. The infant was also crying. At this time, the sound of enemy planes appeared overhead again. A policeman ran over to stop her.</p>
<p>I felt that this situation was a bit wrong. This noisy sound would easily give the enemy planes a target. I left their group and ran towards the Changdi side of Danan Road, running for my life. When I reached the intersection of Jiaoyu Road, I heard a loud bang behind me. The bomb fell where I had just run out of. I wiped a handful of sweat from my forehead, it was so dangerous.</p>
<p>I ran to the place where I came out of the building, only to see that the house had been bombed. There were ruins and ashes everywhere, the fire had been extinguished, and male and female rescue teams and firefighters were excavating corpses and rescuing the wounded in the pile of earth. The ground was splattered with blood and lying with charred corpses. Under the arcade opposite the house, there was also a scrap collector who died of fright from the bombing sound—(Note: garbage man), his tongue and anus were protruding, what a terrible way to die. Beside him was a load of bamboo baskets filled with broken cloth and old glass shards. People were densely surrounded, saying some regrettable sighs and angry words.</p>
<p>I dared not look at that tragic scene anymore. I cannot describe how sad and fortunate I felt at the time! I didn't know if it was tears or laughter! I just felt like I was in an endless abyss, spasming in a dreamlike haze! I went back to my room and threw myself on the bed.</p>
<p>Now Guangzhou is lost. The matter has passed for almost a year; however, the impression it gave me is still so deep and unforgettable. When I think about it, it seems to be dancing before my eyes. One day, we will repay this blood debt from the enemy.</p>

<h3>Nazi Films Also Promote Peace</h3>
<p>— Yin Yuan</p>
<p>Since 1933, the German film industry has been in a dilemma. Films shown in the country had to praise the Third Reich and spread the spirit of National Socialism. If film companies wanted to make money, they had to sell their films abroad, but many countries opposed the ideas of National Socialism. In 1931, the total value of German film exports was 5.9 million marks. By 1937, after "eliminating film industry saboteurs," the value of film exports was 7.2 million marks. Needless to say, the standards of German films also declined.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the decline in the quality of German films was the expulsion of the most outstanding producers, directors, creators, and stars. The most progressive comedy star, Glen Plum, and several other Austrian film artists were imprisoned in concentration camps.</p>
<p>Not all films made in Germany are nationalistic and militaristic. A few years ago, Germany created short operatic films. Since 1933, there has been a trend of making short song and dance films. Mr. Xinzier has raised the standards of such films. It cannot be denied that Germany has produced lovely musical plays under the new regime. However, Xinzier has now left Germany and gone to Hollywood. The second reason for the unsoundness of German films is political censorship. There are more and more official restrictions. Now, no one fully knows the number of orders and prohibitions on German films.</p>
<p>The third reason is really the bad result caused by the unreasonable behavior of the German "Nazi" Party. German films first created the quality of using literary, psychological, and social materials for film production. However, now such films cannot be produced. The Third Reich cannot talk about serious social problems, and psychological themes are only allowed to be produced within strict restrictions.</p>
<p>In today's German films, as well as in many short dramas and short stories, the spirit of cruel militarism has invaded. But not every film has open political propaganda. Ufa, Tobis, Deula, and Bavarian studios are still filming detective and adventure stories. However, a strange phenomenon can be observed, that is, the plots of these films are all set in other countries. Assassination, theft, tyranny, and merciless villains are indispensable in the exciting plots. But official orders say that there are no such dark things in Germany anymore, so it is fortunate. Producers can use Britain, France, the United States, or other countries as backgrounds and produce such films. For example, those scheduled to be produced in 1939 include many films using Alaska, Chile, Africa, Norway, and the United States as backgrounds. Only Japan and Italy do not use them as backgrounds for wrongdoing and gathering places for villains. Regarding films, Japan and Germany have close cooperation. "The Daughter of the Bushido," directed by German Dr. Fink, is the first film jointly produced by Japan and Germany. German is showing Japanese films everywhere, such as "The Power of Japan" starring Raushu, and "The Devil's Hand" produced by the German and United Film Company.</p>
<p>The German government is also gradually persuading Japan to reduce the import of foreign films and show more German and Italian films. Germany and Italy are also cooperating in filming. It is planned to jointly produce three giant films next year. National Socialist propaganda films are shown everywhere in Germany, and a film called "The Sword of Peace" is also being prepared. The content is to describe how "the Bolshevik class struggle in other countries leads to bloody disturbances," and "on the other hand, it describes how Germany is working for peace." Only Heaven knows whether this masterpiece, which tries to cover up the eyes and ears of the world, will succeed!</p>
