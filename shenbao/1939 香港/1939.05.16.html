<h3 id="c1">抗戰後方與國際通衢的　雲南西部的夷民生活 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 閔康（寄自芒市）</p>
<p>（特稿）跟者抗戰的持久與深入，素來少受人注意的雲南，已變了後方的政治，經濟，文化，以至網際交通的中心陣地。滇西邊地的廣大夷民區域，正就是我們西南的國際交通線的必經之地，它在抗戰中的重要性，是不言而知的。記者這次獲得不易得的機會去到漢西邊地走了一，眞是幸事；但總以時間侷促，不能作長期與深入的觀察，只能求其皮毛，不過顧到邊地在抗戰中的重要，所以就急急乎把滇邊的夷族同胞的一般生活狀况與社會情形介紹出來，無非想給一般關心邊地問題的同好，和一般注意少數民族問　的朋友們，聊作區區的參考。</p>
<p>夷民種別</p>
<p>滇西邊地散播着的夷民，大約有八種，棘夷（或作撰夷），山頭夷（俗稱野人），阿昌夷，粟樂夷，崩實夷卡瓦夷，卡拉夷和從內地遷來的漢人。這中間以棍夷人口最多，也是最接近漢化，生性懦弱，深於服從性，其次是山頭夷，他們有兩種，一種長住山上，很少下來，生性較　强，那種時常下山來趕巿集的山頭夷，就比較好些，在從前，他　也很習慣就在市集上打劫和殺戮，後經土司的兵實行在巿集彈壓，現在他們已經不敢了。粟粟夷也像山頭夷一樣，很喜歡喝酒，男性頑悍，恃酒傷人，這脾氣他和野人彷彿。阿昌夷本爲緬人之血族，最近已漸漢化，崩童夷本來也是居住在山上的，因爲受不了山頭夷的欺凌壓迫，現在大多已遷居平地。卡瓦有兩種，有生卡瓦，有熟卡瓦，熟的一種還好，生的一種簡直還有吃人的嗜好，不過他們却不自吃自，而歡喜吃異族，尤其是要吃洋人與漢人。不過這族人數不多，穴居在山上。卡拉夷人數很少，他們已多漢化，生活習慣與漢人相同。至於遷移到那裏去的澳人，爲數却很不少，只亞於夷，他們大鄒還保存着漢人本色，但也有少數因世代已久，變成夷化了的。</p>
<p>四季氣候</p>
<p>邊地多山，大部份區域是熱帶氣候，，早晚凉爽，中午悶熱。傳說那裏瘴氣之甚，簡直可怕，但其實，並不如此。我們未到茫市和遮解之前，在車子上早已諸倫紛紛，有的說怕，有的不怕，有的說雖然不必怕，也不可不信。於是乎「飯不要吃舘』，一睡要起早』之類的句子，已變成了我們的座右銘。幻霞瘴，緣霞瘴，據說是早上出現在山頂上的，黑水瘴，靑蛙瘴，則又是起自於地下的，再加上啞泉之類的傳說，簡直把人嚇得開不出口來，可是一到目的地，那邊的朋友，吿訴我們，却是每餐必飽，早上又要起早，因爲多睡他會反而頭强的。中午的磪有些悶熱，我坐在沙發椅上，總是頭暈暈的難過，遂笑爲那位朋友說：『若是那些瘴氣論家來坐在這椅子上，這又多了一種沙發　了』！那裏的四季氣候。春天和冬天比較睛爽和暖：什麽瘴氣也很少。聽人說起，到了夏秋之季，因爲多雨，加之街道和一切不講衛生，先是雨水一酒，再是太陽一晒，熱騰勝蒸發起這些汚濁氣來之後，沒有瘴氣自然也變成瘴氣了。許多漢人大都到了這兩季要搬家，回到內地，兩季過後，再去那裏。不從衛生設備上努力，而諉之於神秘古怪的瘴氣，這也是我國人偷懶的好方法之一。</p>
<p>十個土司</p>
<p>在滇西邊地，劉分着十個土司區域，各人做着各人的士皇帝，各自相安，這十個土司就是，千崖土司刀承銊，他們是早從明朝初年就開始世襲這個好位子的，區內有五千多戶，約兩萬人，以夷居多，南甸土司襲授，也是從明初世襲的，區內有八千戶，約三萬多人，以漢人居多，戶撤土司賴奉元，從明正統時世襲迄今，區内有五百戶，約一千五百人，以阿昌夷居多，盏遽土司思鴻陛，也是從明初世襲區內有三千戶，約一萬二千，以　夷居多，芒市士司方克勝，由明統正時世襲，區內有五千七百多戶，約二萬八千人，以棘夷居多。遮放土司多英培，由明正統時世襲至今，區內有一千多戶，約二千七百多人，以山頭夷和　夷居多。猛板土司蔣氏，由清光緒時世襲，區內有一百五十多戶，約六百二十多人，以漢人居多。隨川土司多永安，明正統時世襲土司職，區內有一千九百多戶，約七千三百多人，以　夷居多。猛卯土司刀保圖，由明初世襲，區內有一千四百戶，約二千七百多人，以士夷居多，　撤土司蓋炳銓，明正統時世襲。區內有五百五十戶，約一千六百五十人，以阿昌夷居多數。這些土司，大都是從明朝時代征夷；跟着大將軍出征的宜摐司之類，所以都是有四五百年世襲的歷史，他們大都是漢人，但今天也變或夷化。大都士實能說漢話，但文字多很勉强，能通爾地爲一些東西的，只有一個士司刀保圖。其他，代理小士可的方代辦裕之（芒巿），說話比較流利，也是比較獲得一些的一個。</p>
<p>社會制度</p>
<p>夷民區域的社會制度。一方面，是原始的農業　會和游獵社會，另方面。又是地司佔有一切土地，施行極厲害的封建剝削。說起士司，他是一個區域龑的執有生殺予奪之權的最高者，直到今天，夷民見了土司，都必須下跪，夷民自己沒有田地，他們只有替土司耕種。每年除了把百分之三十到五六十的收穫交給土司以外，還有許多支出必須用進貢的方式獻給土可。這些支出主要的是：土司家裏的生育費，娶嫁費，，小土司登位禮費，祝壽費，喪葬費，中秋端五之類的節費，過年禮費，洗犂耙費，霜降節祭費，土司家的柴薪費，邊界勘界會議費，趕擺費，保岡費等等。這些費用，多由所謂頭（現改稱鄉長）之類，代土司到每（卽每鄕）去分派。在夷民社會中，女的勞動比男的多，但它民經是男權針會。但是土司的權力只能及於棘夷和居留夷民區的漢人，山上的野人之類，他是管不到也剝削不到的。野人或栗粟之類，他們在山上有自已的寨長或山官，但山官封他們沒有土司這樣的生殺予奪之權，只有在對外（對異族或對另一區另一寨之類）作戰時，山官才有統領全寨民衆之權。此外，在夷民社會裏，和尙僧侶的地位很高，夷民都尊敬他們。土司行爲不對，夷民不敢也無權說話，能够的，只是和尙可以說幾句，自然也有限度。</p>
<p>夷民職業</p>
<p>在這裏，土司衙門裏的官吏，鄕長鄒長和閭長，學校裏四敎師，廟裏的和尚，這些已接近統治階級，人數不多，普通的夷民，是沒有樣利來担任的。夷民的一般職業，主要的是從農，替土司耕種，這是佔絶大的多數；其次是做些小買賣，這是比較有些少資產的一羣，他們靠着一點小本錢，從買賣中過活，在邊地的漢人，他們大都就是這一種。夷民區除了五天趕一次市集之外，平日毫無巿面，也無店鋪。但是茫市的漢人街，和各區漢人集中的街道，總有小小的一點巿面，如幾家吃食店，什貨店之類。但是夷民還不習慣，所以這些小店舖除了市集一天比較忙些之外，平日生意是很冷淡的。其他，還有一些小手工業和散工，如打鐵舖·木匠以及替人家春米之類·紡織工作，在夷民區域裏還不發達，只有很少數的人家，可以見到夷民子女在紡織，而且工具與藝術多很幼稚，出産景幾乎談不到。所以夷民的衣服問題還很嚴重，幾乎全仰給于外地。</p>
<p>出產物品</p>
<p>邊地氣候炎熱，雨量也多，所以很適宜於農作物，但是由於拼種方法不行，不懂得利用肥料，實行每年二種，還沒有做到地盡其和的地步，比　進步些的地方，廿已經做到　年一次　稻，一次雜糧，交互施種着，那裏主要出産的有，稻麥，鴉片，菜蔬，水菜，豆類，咖啡，和少許木棉，除了米的質量很好外（有些像江浙的常熱米，但有些人說這木不易消化，所以不好）其他的要算鴉片煙最繁盛，因爲許多山地，宜於種煙，但這種繁盛，自然是配不上好宇的，此外菜蔬的種類很少，主要原因他們只有相傳的老法子，也沒有其他的菜種去試權，水菓味道　好，與我們在其他熱帶各地吃到的味道完全不同，我先嘗了甘　，一點也不甜，後來買了一些香蕉嘗試，吃了兩隻只覺得酸和澀，毫無胃口，這一來使我見了波　；也怕得不敢嘗試，其他咖啡之類，也產有少許。至於木材竹料，除了平原較少外，在山地上，到處皆是。關於　在地下的　產，因爲至今還好好地藏在地下，無從說起，但據一般人觀察，說是很豐富的。</p>
<p>宗教信仰</p>
<p>夷民中以夷最信仰佛敎，其他諸夷。這是價仰多神拜物敎的。就是說，他們見了什麽都拜，以爲每搬東西裏都有一個神。在　夷集中的區域裏，供　　迦摩尼佛的廟就很多。只是芒市一區，據說有五十幾個廟。在一個叫菩提寺的廟賽。我從一個會說一些漢話的當家和尙那裏知道：他們最忙的有三個節，就是正月的年節，六月　的進窩，九月裏的出窩，這三節香火頂盛。爽民拜神的東西，是香燭和鮮花，不燒紙物。和尙的衣食，仰給於人民，送他什麽，吃用什麽，不衣靠廟産：據說，這廟是沒有廟產的。我問他每天吃幾頓，他說只吃一頓，我有些不大相信，因爲他太肥，和旁邊一個瘦弱的小和尙一比，這是可以置　的。芷在談話間，却看見一位夷女子挑了一些東西，直進內房去了，我先是驚奇。後來想起魯迅說過：『和尙沒有老婆二小和尙那　來？』遂爲釋然。在另二個家裏，我走進去，他們正在開飯，當家和沿一個人吃四樣菜，大和尚雨個人坐了一桌。也是四據：火腿炒白菜，淸燉火腿，豆芽菜，酸靑菜（是夷女人必須會做的一種菜。因爲她未嫁前，她的未婚夫曾間她會不會做這和菜）。和尙吃暈，固爲在此地是公開的。山頭夷是十分尊實諸葛孔明，因爲傳說七擒孟獲的征南　，就是征的他們。在遮放，我有一天想上山去看看野人生活，但必須要有護兵保護；我突然想起，由於來時不知，否則可以找件做戲用的八卦衣和鵝毛扇帶來，獨個人搖搖提　擺上山去，倒可以横行無阻的。</p>
<p>文化教育</p>
<p>說夷民沒有文化，這是寃狂的；少用文字和有文字而不用，這是砍實的。夷文字比較多被應用，山　夷的文字，是由美國傳敎師響他們創迭的。同時，每種夷民，有着一很或幾視自己的語言。此外，學漢文的也小少。最近幾年來，政府注意到邊地夷民的教育，撥出相當經費，委托土司就地辦理學校，大都是小學程度。在一個細夷家裏，我叫一個小學生拿出他的　本來給我看，一本是幼學　林，裏固除了漢文，却他印上一些英文，一本商務版的自然學，一本三民主義讀本，還有一本我毫不瞭解的　文。我問他在第幾班，囘答是第四班一共分六班，到第二班才讀英文。每年只有五六個月。是開學的，現在已陽歷四月，他們的年假還未放完。芒市是最憲庶最進步的一區，共有十八個學校·每校約四九十人，共計約有七八百個小學生。這還是據土司自己說的。還有，寺廟也牧學生，那只能學一些夷文的經典，學時也穿小迦裟，學好後出家或還便俗聽便。沒有學校之前，它就是唯一的求學聖地，夷文與續文甚接近，英國人卽利用緬文做楊標。設置山頭學堂等等。來傳播他們的文化。</p>
<p>風俗習慣</p>
<p>夷氏每年的最路節日，就是和他們的　節相關連的，盛節的唯一表現，就在男女靑年的歡騰。淸明節以後的七天裏。是他們的所謂潑水節，就是男女互相撥冷水爲戲，不管認職不認識，可隨使亂撥，這是他們相找對象的機會。還有進窩出窩兩個節，本來是四十歲以上的老年人條道拜佛的節氣，但是靑年男女在這兩個時期也特別熱鬧，互相調情。夷民的婚費，除了土司及其親屬外，比較簡短。從前娶親條件很苛刻，目前土司規定，例如在遮放，大致是一百五十羅比，八十碗酒（約五六十斤），八十塊肉（約二百斤）就可以娶一個老婆，若是連這一些都拿不出呢，那還有搶婚一法可以補激，就是男的帶女的逃走，丈母娘自然要追，但是你逃東，，她卻追西，本來是爲了敷衍面子，等到三四個星期過後，一對男女回家了，親戚們勸勸，稍微送些禮物，就算了事，目前，據說搶婚比球婚多了。有天我們去看嫁新娘，只聽到房裏幾十個女子哭聲震天，而且聲調一致，我疑心是走錯了人家，這裏或是喪家，來後知才道，這是和新娘哭別，凡是新娘的女友，都得同聲一哭。喪事比較更簡短，薄薄的棺材，幾個族人靜悄悄地抬往山上埋了就是，而且墳幕造得髙出地面不到一尺，土司規定，民墳不準刻碑留名，暹了不久，他的子孫也找不見他祖宗的墳墓所在了。但是我們看見，土司的坟墓却很髙大，刻上官銜。還有和尙的坟是造成塔形，有土司題碑，夷民送喪醴，大都是兩竹簡米和二三百個小錢（約三毛錢）。服飾方面，以夷最潔凈，野女人衣的衣黑，耳朶上掛大環。食物方面，有三句活可以表現：酸　夷。腥野人臭卡瓦。野人山居，這是大都游獵生活，耕種較少。吃食物時候，還可以看到無産制的象徵，就是不論大小主客，每人兩包飯，够不够不管。夷民喜食檳榔，吃得牙齒墨黑，嘴唇血紅，與安南人相仿。但進步的年靑女子，已懂得牙齒以白爲美了。夷民往往以這個土司不好，就搬到另一個土司區去求地耕種。因爲夷民身無長物，般家極易，有句俗話，『夷民搬家，不滿三挑』，所惟流動性極大。</p>
<p>男女關係</p>
<p>夷民靑年的男女社交，倒比較自由，非漢人所及。他們互相求愛，視爲公開的正大光明的舉動，毫無掩飾和虛僞。普通求愛的場所，有兩個地方，就是山上和打米的磨坊。求愛的方法，就是唱歌。男唱女答，互相言情。入晚，我們可以在每個米坊門前，看見蹲着一排靑年男子，因爲夜凉，都披上一張氈十，米坊裏工作的大都是靑年女子，男的依據每人歌唱技能的髙下，排爲前後，唱得最好的在第一位蹲着先唱，唱好後接下去是第二個，女子聽了在裏面也囘唱，同意時她可能也出來和他談一囘情再進去工作，最有趣的是在一羣靑年後面，還跟着一串小孩子，他們也蹲著，披着一條小氈子，低低地也畢着他們的哥哥們唱，他們並不拔對象，我叫他們爲『見習生』。在山上完全唱的是山歌，人數史多，我叫一個懂得一些漢文的夷翻譯給我聽，根據他不很流利的漢話，大槪可以譯成這樣：男的先唱；（未完）</p>

<p>廣東省務會議，最近通過了一個審省戰時施政綱要，尅日令飭所屬遵照實施。原案包括三大部門：第一，在革新政治方面，首先就用『扶植善良懲治士劣』『褒揚節義消弭奸邪』以發揚正氣，也可說是精神總動員運動的眞體化，當大有助於民族自尊心與自信心之提髙。箕次是『實行省府合署辦公』，『劃淸權責裁併駢技』，『健全鄉鎭保甲組織』『改善游擊區行政機構』，這更是久爲各方呼鑲的『調整行政機構』的基本步驟。再次是『羳除食汚』，『選用賢能』『厲行考績』『培養幹部』等，不僅是整飭吏治的主要辦法，也正是改進政治的先决條件。此外如整訓團隊警察，肅淸七劣漢奸以綏靖地方；如擴大抗戰建國宣傳，加緊民衆組　訓練，普及國民軍事訓練，策動民衆協助軍事以切實動員民衆；如改善兵役推行方法，優待出征軍人家屬，以獎進乓役運動支持持久抗戰；又如加緊救濟工作，推進戰時衛生，厲行禁絕烟賭，尤其是保障歸國僑胞，將勵僑胞開發實業，便利僑胞匯欵等，都是適應目前增進粤省政治力量最切要的辦法。第二，在經濟方面，關於整理財政的，决定了『整飭稅制』『廢除苛雜，禁止濫征』『整理縣市財政』『確定自治經費』『增設各地金庫』『維持債務信用』等辦法；關於活動金融的，决定了『推行省券穩定金融』，『嚴禁僞幣行使』，『發展省行業務』，『調整戰區金融』，『獎進節約儲蓄』，『推行農工放欵』等辦法；關於推進地政方面，决定了『指定地區實騐土地整理』。『繼續土地測量登記』，『改善領墾荒地手續』等辦法；關於開發實業的，决定了『整理發展省營事業』，『奬勵工業』，『促進農作事業』『開發重要礦產等』辦法；此外還決定了關於整飭交通，管理貿易，改良會計等具體辦法，這些辦法不僅完全適應廣東在抗戰中的迫急的需要，而且也可預先奠定將來建國事業的基礎。第三，在文化上，這個施政綱要上更明白規定：『施行戰時教程』，『推進義務敎育』，『充實戰時社會敎育設施』，『資助戰地退出教員學生』，『扒行搖黎民教育』，『保障教育經費』，『增進教育行政效率』等辦法，以發展抗戰建國的教育，同時還規定，『發揚固有文化』，『促進科學研究』，『發展戰時藝術』等項，更日　目前動員全民力量支持抗戰，與推進新啓蒙運動，以建立理想的民有民治民享的新中國的重要步驟。</p>
<p>廣東省務會議決定的這個戰時施政綱要之擬訂，是經國非常慎重的攷慮的，首由省府各廳高級職員，秉乘省府李主席與各廳長的意旨，斟酌廣東環境及財政力量，草成初稿，其後又頻頻開會討論，擬定草案，再由李主席約請視察粤省黨政的中委陸幼剛鄧靑陽曁各委員等逐項討論修正，然後提出五月初間第廿八次省務會議通過，公佈實施。其中所列項目辦法，都可視爲廣東省在抗戰二十二個月以來血淚的經騐及教訓的結晶，也都是目前廣東戰時環境與任務所急需，而又爲人力財力所能推行的；因此，不僅不同於過去任何閉門製造或代表某種片面需要而製造的施政需要，而且也不同於全憑理論與理想的政治綱領。我們對於這一可稱最爲完善的戰時施政網領的產生，謹當代表廣東與全國民衆，向粤省主席及各領袖，表示熱烈的崇高的敬愛！現據韶關通訊，關於這個綱領，已經按其性質，分由各主管機關集合專門人才訂定實施辦法，準備普遍切實地付諸實施，這又使我們對於廣東政治前途與全民　戰前途，發生無限的希望，增加無限的勝利信心！不過我們懲前　後，猶有不能已於言者，敢謹供献蒭議三點，以供參攷。卽第一，我們希望這個比較極爲完善的施政綱領，不再蹈過去不能兌現的覆轍，不要再是祇在筆墨之間而不能成爲事實。要達到這要求，首先誠懇祈望於粤省當局的認　督促各關係　關切實施行，其次是誠懇祈望各關係機關負責人能够深切認淸忠賓執行這一綱領的重要意義，盡力克復一切阻難，切實認眞的進行奮鬥，求其實現。而尤爲重要的是要加緊向全專民衆作普遍的深入的宣傳與解釋的工作，使全粤人民人人課淸這個施政綱領的實現與否，關係全粤與全國整個命運，使全粤人民人人認淸遵奉政府法令協助政府實施這個綱領，是大家目前的主要任務。同時我們要堅决認淸，這種廣泛與深入的宣傳工作的推進，不僅有賴於關係機關負責人員之努力，尤有賴於大胆地擢引一般對政治有正確爲識對抗戰有堅強信心對羣衆工作有豐富經騐並旦在廣東民衆中具威信的各黨派的靑年幹部人才。第二，我們爲求這一比較最爲完善的施政綱領的實現，還有一個重要的先决條件，就是必須普遍的切實的發揚中山先生平生倡導的民主的精神，以發揚全省人民擁護這一綱領之實施的自動性和積極性，首先是祈望於省參議會之予以熱烈的擁護，認眞發動民衆起來擁護；同時還要加緊切實促使各市縣以至鄕鎭參議會組織的建立，自下而上地輔助政府，認眞推行。第三，我們認爲這個施政綢領，不僅適合於粤省今日的迫急需要，同時大致也適合於其他各省的泊急需要，我們祈望各省以粵省府爲模範，爭先切實認眞地擬具與推行這種戰時施政綱領，以共謀動員全民力量，支持持久抗戰，奠定建國基礎。最後，我們更要認清，×人汗奸，是不希望我們這種施政綱領之完善施行的，他們勢必用一切方法進行阻礙與破壞，特別是用造謠挑撥離間分化等陰謀毒計，因此我們更必須和這種陰謀毒計鬥爭，而主要的是要鞏固我們的抗日民族统一戰線，鞏固各民族各黨派各階層各團體機關及人民與政府間的親密合作！</p>
<h3 id="c3">拉丁化新文字是一個最理想的　扒行生活教育運動的工具　……讀了陶行知先生的「告生活教育社同志書」之後 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 遲丹</p>
<p>第二，就是怎樣使全國的同胞能有二種共通的語言。現在雖然一有一種『普通話』（北方語），但是這種語言祇通行在少數的知識份子中間，大多數的同胞四採用着自己的方言；雖然抗戰也使中國的各種方言有五相接隧交溶的機會；若我們能加强它，使之神速地發展，促成中華民族的民族的統一語的形成；使方霄土語凈化，使中國的語文和文化　楊到更高的階叚。</p>
<p>無疑的，這兩個部題的解决是要依賴實施全面敎育生活教育的。陶先生說</p>
<p>『要把一個×××××封建的國家變成一個絕本是少數人所能辦得成功的。我們必須敎育大衆，一同起來，負担這個偉大的使命，但是要，百姓都獲得這種敎育必須有三個條件。</p>
<p>第一要省錢，使無錢的老百姓可以受敎育。</p>
<p>第二要省時間，使沒有空閒的老百姓也能求　。</p>
<p>第三要通俗，便沒有受通敎育的老百姓也能了解。</p>
<p>拉本化新文學的理論和實踐，可以說正是爲了這三個條件，而產生。換句話說能够成爲現代化的新文字，適應大衆的需要，要具備類似的三　條件；</p>
<p>第一，要容易學習和使用。因爲我們舊有的漢字的困難，要克記幾千個如萬花筒的變化一樣的，音義形的方塊，非得有五年以上的時間不成，</p>
<p>第二，要能充分地表現大衆的口頭話，如實地書寫出來。</p>
<p>第三，要能和現代技術生活配合起來，比如打字，印刷，打電報，編目，　語，翻譯接受國際進步的文化等等。</p>
<p>因爲：拉丁化新文字的本身正具備着這三個條件，來適應了敎育是大衆的要求的。</p>
<p>要街錢和省時閒，不浪費金錢和精力拉了化新文字便是一個最理想的推行生活敎育運動的工具。根據一九三六年，蔡元培，孫科，馮玉祥，柳亞子等六百餘人簽名的，我們對於推行新文字的意見書上，曾有一個小統計說：</p>
<p>根據上海話新文字方案實驗内結果，平常人每天費一小時，只須半個月的工夫，即可寫新文字的信，看新文字的報，讀新文子的書。笨一點的人只須一個月（卅個鐘頭），成績也就不錯了每人所花的。只要三分錢。義務敎育培養一個小孩　年平上要化九毫錢。民衆敎育培養一個成人一塊八毫錢。上海一帶運甩小先生去敎嘆字也得化三毫錢。三萬萬人的普及最組淺的漢字敎育至辦得九千萬……若推義起新文字來，時和間金錢方面看，新文字是普及大衆敎育的最經濟的文字工具』。</p>
<p>而且抗戰後，在上海公共租界工部局華人敎育處處長陳鶴琴先生支持之下的新文宇敎育的成續已經是非常可觀了</p>
<p>第三要通俗，使沒有受過敎育的老百姓也能了解。事實上要做到『通俗』，除了用拉丁化新文字外，用漢字是有限度的。因許多老百姓掛在嘴上說力話，多數是漢字　法表現和書寫的，相反的，若是要用新文字來寫『之乎也者』的文言文或『洋八股』，或所謂『語錄體』的，也是無法懂的。祇有用活先生的現代人的口語才能表現。這樣『通俗』在新文字已經不是『要求』或『口號』，而是『生命線』。『非這樣通俗不可』，否則，便不　懂。而且，用新文宇還可以使中國語和書寫合一合　化。記得先前胡愈之先生提倡漢字的詞兒連寫，但是結果漢字是無法連寫的。這是胡先生暴　漢字的不合理。比如抗戰，宣傳，三民主義，同是一個槪念，漢字却分了二塊或四塊，或肆塊以上連不起來，所以詞兒連寶，在老百姓用起是更加便當了。因爲他們知鋤頭，不是鋤和頭的。</p>
<p>現在，我應該結束這篇文字，我們知道拉丁化文字，祇是一種語文工具只是一種簡易的語文工具當然不能包括，敎育，或其他的全部，但是我們也不能否認，工具的優劣，是足以决定一件事物的成敗的，好像，社會内生產工具，竟能决定生産關係以至整個的社會制度一樣，同時，也正如「動員全國知　份子掃除文育普及民衆　識以　抗戰建國』的提案中說過，其實在識字訓　時，即可同時　輸關於抗戰建國的初步知　，那麽，希望全國每一個智　份子，鄒起來積　推行拉丁化新文字運動！</p>

<h3 id="c5">鄧龍光將軍訪問記 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 王河天</p>
<p>【本報特稿】沉寂了幾個月的西江前線、現在又緊張起來了、從力江偷渡的×寇正在沙坪江門一帶與我們爭奪着、江門得而復失的不下整十次，×人的海陸空協攻、戰况的激烈，是北汀戰事以來所罕見、這幾天來的斬獲、計擊斃×兩位大隊畏支松直木、傷亡的×兵不算、並生擒×僞軍兩百餘人、實是×人侵略以來一個嚴重的打擊、也是我們華南抗戰以來勝利的一頁、</p>
<p>可是、這回勝利的創造者、就是數次北上殺×的鄧龍光將軍、南潯綫殺×的威風、又呈現在西江前綫、大家聽到這種消息、自然是很歡喜的。本戰區戰地視　團，正在前線砲聲隆隆的時候、抵達××、　得很難得的機會、　者特走訪保衛西江的軍事首領鄧龍光將軍、</p>
<p>大家都曉得鄧將軍、是　軍（第四軍）的宿將、他有毅奮鬥的精神，他有深謀遠慮的膽略、一看到他那副精明果敢的眼光、百粤僥將的丰度、使我想起鐵軍創造者張發奎將軍精神的影響、大家有同樣的風格</p>
<p>鄧將軍住在一間新建的茅屋裏，佈置很簡單、客廳上排着幾張小櫈子與一張長檯外、就是　上掛着有整丈幾個的地圖，他正在屋裏與林主任　視察團主任）看地圖、商談我們軍隊如何佈防、敵人從那要進攻、怎樣去殲滅×人、談得津津有味、深覺勝利是很有把握的、但是他對這種問題很小心叫參謀長與林主任特別研究、筆者乘機請敎、鄧將軍也沒有什麽客氣好像老朋友般很痛快地說出他的觀感，</p>
<p>（一）囘粤後的感想他說、「自統一運動完成之後、廣東的軍事政治沒有什麽進步、所得的効果祗是力量統一了、但這力量的實質並未因此而堅强、而且一部份的量是龐大了、質的方面更加空虛、北上×殺各部隊之能稍有樹立，純係各該部的人的歷史淵源所積累得來、所以×人自愿淡登睦僅旬日卽陷廣州。這並不是什麼意外之事、我自南京突圍之後、即返湘南補整助部、後復調粤、隨解軍職、而一手編組成立多年之一五六師撥入六四軍、復北上參加武漢外圍戰，我本人於　州陷落二日前　粤，往返於湘贛桂各地月餘、即旋鄉小休，後奉令接長六十四軍、以病惡　月餘痊，久未接事、前月底始到肇、至今僅一個月時期、因此、所謂囘粵後的感想、就是一向的感恩、我一向的感想是、無論軍事政治及社會的一切、私心的惡病、一日不淸除、一切都無辦法、現在仍然是「事實的遷就」支配了整個局面、上間的人，時時會陷在「好人難做」的圈套裏、我個人自守的是有一分力盡一分力、所　督部亦懸此鵠而共赴、不爭長短、不計罪功、于人的歧視之下、于事事困難痛苦之中，献身于民族至上、國家至上、</p>
<p>（二）對第二期抗戰的意見他說「抗日戰爭、是民族存亡的最後關頭的戰爭、也是兩個國力的競賽的戰爭、應該發動全民族的力量起來爲保衞祖國而戰們、第二期抗戰的勝利把握在于發動民衆，欲發動民衆、又必須政治明朗化、以期實現孫子所云『這者、全民與上同意、可與之死、可與之生、而不長　、』我的意見就以政治明朗化、軍事紀律化—個字爲一切的基礎</p>
<p>（三）西江民衆動員的情形、「這個問題就事實來說、是無從談起廣州失陷後、粤人對政府的信仰已降至零度、所以做過順民豎白旗下意識、在一部的無知的近硯的限光內搖動得動十個起勁、本軍到後、軍隊的紀律稍予民衆一點好的印象、雖然不能愛民如子、然也絕沒有擾民、觀感上略改好了、然而生長已久之劣根性、不易馬上淸除、所以民心的收拾、是極費時費力，政治上的運用、現在因鄉政機構不健全，民衆還是推也推不動、第一步着手辦理淸查戶口　淸匪患從事組織、這種種工作都自是官兵親自動手，的　筆者這幾大視察　軍師團政治工作、都將民衆運動劃在工作日程裏、已工隊，各師都有三拾多名，整個負担這項工作、正從官傳而入組織、訓練、如文圍鄉、他們把民衆　密組織起來、各防軍的鄉村裏都是同樣的工作、尤是　西江抗日靑年團正篷勃地在　江各　發展着、這些難非該軍發動的，但鄧軍長極力指導鼔勵他們工作、予他們工作上各種的方便、這都是一種新現象，</p>
<p>「因爲戰地　軍民運沒有很好的規定、黨政軍合作、還未臻够密切、以致動員民衆方、沒有很好的配合、你做他跟着來已是最好現象了、你做他仍然袖手旁觀的、本軍現尙無政治部組織、發動民衆、組織民衆的主要工具不合、一切都吃力、實現發揮民衆力量打擊×人的時期還遙遠呢』、</p>
<p>（四）×人對華南的企圖如何？他說：「×人侵華的目的自然是出中奏摺所說：「奪取中國　爲稱覇世界的大本營、現在×人以華治華的計劃已經失敗、而　戰速决的企圖又落了空、廣州旣已以意外得之，自然更欲擴大戰果、所以×人對華南的企圖、第一是斷絕我外援的路綫、第二是聯緊華南的力量、故打通粤漢路與進攻廣西是×人寝寐難忘的、這次×人自九汀偷渡本是試探件質、與搶　掠糧食、但是一過河後就被我軍句圍在沙坪痛　，因此×失敗的羞怒、一二次的增兵由幾百而至三千人、以致江門的爭奪戰、現在尙在爭持中、不管×人是試棵抑是總攻、我們誓以軍人守土的天職將×人掃蕩出上發揮我們『廣東革命精神』的　拳給×人一個最後的打擊、』</p>
<p>他說到此、眼睛向着憤恨的火焰、戰場上指揮三軍的叱咤的氣慨、在他面龐上流露着就是胆小畏怯的人一看到這種　戰沙場的英勇鎮鎮的精神，都會興奮起來，一談又談了整个鐘頭，怕祖擱他的公事、辭別歸來、明月正在普照大地、疏稀的炮聲、從前線傳來、我想家正等候　明天捷音的傳來，</p>

<p>會長、副會長，各位先生、今天全國的農、工、鑛、交通、經濟各專家、相聚一堂、舉行生產會議、我能藉此機會。和各位見面、有無限的愉快、無限的希望、現在全國有兩大主要工作、</p>
<p>一、前方抗戰，一，是後方生產，今天在後方生産，是和前力將士抗戰、做了同樣神聖的事業二沒有前方將士流血、不能保護後方生産、沒有後方生產、也不能支持前方抗戰、我們在這裏、開生產會議、是和一個軍事會議同樣重要、</p>
<p>自從抗戰以來、×人除了殺戮我們同胞、强佔我們土地、焚燒我們財物以外，又封鎖我們的海口、刦掠我們的資源，轟炸我們的各個城巿、想來破　我們一切生產事業、在這種艱難困苦情形之下、我們企業家、都能竭力擁護政府抗戰、艱苦奮鬥、慘淡支持、這是我們企業家的光榮、現在這裏開會、各位好多不辭跋涉、從遠處到來、這種愛國精神、和自强不息、實在難能可貴、</p>
<p>同時、各位知道、我們的物質、不如×人、我們地大物博、何以物質不如×人呢、因爲我們的物力、雖然無限、可是多沒有經過一番人力創造的工夫、　句詁說、就是因爲貨棄於地、所以物質不如人、就是内爲我們過去忽視生産，和無計劃生産、所以物質不如人、旣不如人、就要拚命攻進、我們在軍事上、要整軍建軍、建立我們現代的國防軍備、在生産上、也要調整生產、造產、建產，建立我們現代的國防産　、在　次生產會　之中、希望各位　重討論、切實研究、來檢討過去、策勵　來、並將討論的辦法、立刻切實施行、　適應抗戰需要，這是這一次會議的重大意義、和重大任移、</p>
<p>我常常講、經濟軍事敎育、是國家三大生命力的源泉、亦是國家當前的三大要政、所謂現代　家、就是經濟自立的國家、就是有現代生産武裝的團家、我們的　難、雖是多方面的、但根本原因、寔在由於經濟落後、各位知道×人×野蠻的軍事進攻我國、　的最後目的、是經濟侵略。現在×人在華北正拚命淮行經濟侵略、雖然×人的毒計、决不能實現，但我們要深深認識×人吸血食肉的猙獰面目、一個民族精神，被人屈服、是亡國的開端、而經濟的破産、才是亡國的終結、我們今天姿動員精神、同時要以精神的動員逮到物質的總動員、如果我們在抗戰期間，不能同時發展生產、就不能支持長期抗戰、而且卽使抗戰勝利、如果全國經濟破産、這國家還是隨時可以亡的、這幾天各位目擊　無人性的×人濫炸重慶中區，這極毫無軍　價　轟炸的殺人放火、固然表現×人的卑鄙無恥、但我們還要認淸×人是妄想藉此威脅我們的精神，毀滅我們的生産、我們固然萬分悲憤、但找們更應該咬牙切齒、加緊工作、克服困難、在血光與火光之中、　　我們的精神武器、建設我們的物質武器、不獨要以長期的血戰苦鬥，驅逐　　的×人、而且要以授期的慘淡經營、建立富强的三民主義的新中國、</p>
<p>說到富强，是古今中外立國兩大根本方針、這是中國最古的立國方針、也是世界最新立國方針、可惜許多人還不了解這一點，但我們必須痛切覺悟，國家富强、才能生存、在今天的世界、要富要强、就要足食足兵、令天所謂足食，就是發展生產、所謂足兵、就是整軍建軍、必須足食足兵、才能長期抗戰、才能建設富强的三民主義國家、必須發展生產，才能改善人民生活才能使大家豐衣足食、必須發展生産、才能保障國家生存、現代戰爭、無論裝備給養、均須仰賴工業、所以生産是國計民生的中心問題、</p>
<p>我們物質旣不如人，要一面以精神補物質之不足、一面　嬰迎頭趕上、加速經濟建設、建設是抗戰的後盾、也是抗戰的目的、建設三民主義國家的根本工作，是生産建設，　理所說，『建設之首要在民生』、就是這個意思、總理一生的目的、就是要建設一個國家富强、民生安樂的國家。這也是本黨革命的目的、總理廿年前、就提出一個實業計劃、這偉大方案、還是我們今天經濟建設之根本政策、當時總理想利用歐戰後的國際資力、開發中國實業、今天雖然時過境遷、大規模的國際投資、一時也許不易、但仍要繼續努力、一面儘可能的招請外資，一面盡最大努力來自力建設、我　前提出的國民藉濟建設運動、就是要促進國民全體一致努力利用自己的力量，來開展生產、開發富源、充實現代國家的力量、我提倡有年、但必須吿訴大家、國民經濟建設運動，離完成之日　遠得很、這個運動、還要繼續下去、今天在抗戰時期、更要加倍努力、迅速完成這個運動、關於今天戰時國民經濟建設運動、我想提出幾點意見、供各位參攷、　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c13">全國生產會議孔院長開幕詞原文 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— （續昨）</p>
<p>（一）生産種類性質之選擇　大凡生産之業、多半於國家經濟有所裨補、但緩急先後之間，其效用互不相同、所以生產的　質種類、必須求其合乎目前的迫切需要、近來各地物價、一再上漲，其主要的原因。就是供求不能調　、人民生活必需品感覺缺乏，而奢侈品消耗品則仍充斥市面、這是一種很不合理的現象、今後不但輸入品應力求切合需要、就是國內的生産事業、也應竭力減少消耗品與奢移品的製造、集中一切資本勞力，從事於生活必需品、輸出貿易品與國防工業品的生産、生活必需品中，尤當注意於糧食産量的增加、與紡織工業的提倡、我國號號稱農業國家、但糧食的輸入　甚鉅、現在淪陷區域日廣、輸入路綫中斷、自非在内地努力增加產量、不足以應急　、紡織事業向多集中於沿海口岸、自戰事發生後、現在軍隊人民的衣着問題、均有待於內地紡織工業的建立、輸出貿易生產在目前也甚爲重要，卽抗戰以來所有外匯基金之充實、軍械之補充、各種必需品之購入、都是靠土貨的輸出以爲補償，如桐油、茶葉，皮毛等物品的生産、務宜提倡椎廣、至於國防工業的建設、不但關係抗戰前途、同時關係建國大計、更應統籌熟計、積極迆行、</p>
<p>（二）生産事業之地域分配，在此抗戰當中全國經濟生産重心、已由東南而轉移於西北，所以本人以爲、第一、應先將西北建省成功、始能發揮經濟力量、以爲全國復興繁榮的基礎，故對目前經濟建設應着重于西南西北各省、斟酌其原料的來源、勞力的供給、供求的狀况等、以確定何地宜於何種事業、何時宜於何種生産、通盤籌劃、以求其至當、第二、因爲事業之成功、不僅賴有詳密之計劃、尤貴於努力推進其工作、現在抗戰緊急之際、凡事必須坐言起行、創及腹及、以敏捷的手段、獲致最大的效果、此次生產會議之目的、乃産生而會議、不是爲會講而會議議、</p>
<p>故凡會議商决各事、務使立付實施，以應事機其關於推進工作應行生産的事項、亦有下列各點、</p>
<p>（一）生產機關組織織改進，組織應力求其健全、而組織與組織之間、尤貴互相協定，在過去各地生産機關、往往缺乏密切的聯緊、呈現一種偏枯的狀態、常有幾種組織祗着重於某一種事業、而使有若干種應行提倡的事業、及無人注意提倡、結果一方面特別發展、而另一方面因資本勞力的缺乏、許多事業不能充分發展、至於各機關的內部，也有組織龐大部門繁複、不但運用上有欠靈活，而事權上亦不甚分明，因而發生許多人事的磨擦、此類情形、恐怕在官辦事業中、更易　現、今後無論公私事業、其組織應力求商單合理、商業化，平民化、不可沾染舊日衙門陋習、誓不作事尙空談、而不務實際、</p>
<p>（二）生產經費之籌槽與支配、我國生産資本本來缺乏、在此抗戰明間、情形更當困難、國家經濟建設之最髙原則、在於自力更生、故除不得已而利用外資外、應一方努力發展國家資本、一方收集民間零散資金、集少成多、爲用自大、諸如推廣農村合作、獎勵人民儲　等、均應切實注意、至於生產經費、支配之是否合理、關係尤爲量大、提倡生產之目的、在於增加物賣、充實抗戰力量、必須以最低限度投資、獲致最大限度的生產，方能符合經濟原則、故各生產機關、對於經費之支配方法、是否妥善，有無浪費情事、能否更進一步的講求經濟辦法、均應根據報吿、切實研討、政府提倡節約、不僅希望在消費方面要節衣縮食、更要生產方面、力求經濟合理、尤望各位能在這一點上、切實注意、</p>
<p>（三）生産方法之改良、生產方法之應力求科學化、與現代化、爲國家建設過程中不易的鐵則、但戰時各種生產設備、或則遭受摧殘、或則因交通困難、動力設備缺乏、以及不易恢復、用　從新購置建立、亦非短時內可以急切收效、故不得不就原有生產方法、及生產機構、如手工業、家庭工業、農村副業等、參照現代學理、加以改民、以增進其效率、務使理論與方法相配合、事業與環境相滴應、新舊協調、相輔爲用、我國土廣人盛、現在壯丁雖有增調入伍的、但婦孺老幼儘有剩餘勞力、且婦女之　質、亦最宜於此種工作、若能設法利用、使從事於主產、於增强抗戰、力量必有很大的裨益、</p>
<p>（四）生産合作之訓練、語云，『十年樹木、百年樹人』、一切事業的發展、都有賴于人力的推動、所以訓練人才、是推進將來生產的發動機、生敎育、提倡不遺餘力、但近來學校敎育過於偏重理論、國家歲費鉅欵、創辦髙等敎育、造就出來的人才、多半不能從事于實際生產、實在是一種浪費，本人以爲目前高等技術人才、固甚需要、但需要的人數有限、尙　羅致、最惑缺乏的是技術工人、因這利人材、乃生産專業的中堅份子、各産業先進的國家、其經濟財富、無不以其大量的技術工人爲基礎、歐戰前德國的富源卽以此爲重要成份，戰後之加速復興、亦復如此、倘無熟紅酒之工人、則雖有完善之設備、亦因爲用不得其當，致耗指浪費、减少其效能、所以今後瞧就各生產部鬥、創設職業學校、除灌輸學理外、更要使之有實習機會、務使學校與事業打成一片、理論與實　互相聯貫、靑年無失業的恐慌，社會不感人材的缺乏、建設復興、始克有濟、</p>
<p>以上所說、不過略舉大槪、諸位均爲産機關的主管人員、或係國內知名專家、必能各本平時研究所知、體騐所得、綱舉條目，悉心研討、，貢献國家、蔣委員長說、抗戰勝利之貫澈、必從做到無廢人、廢物、廢地、廢時、四者以求之、而所以達到杜絕此四廢之目的、又必從發展經濟、增加農業生産、及積極扶助手工業做起、在此抗戰二期現階段中、固然注重於前方抗戰、而後方生産建設、亦爲最切要之工作、諸位今日所負之責任、實與前方抗戰將士同其　大、比次旣不辭勞苦而來此出席會議、其熱心與毅力、已充分表現、本人相信此次會　、必能有良好之成績、而於抗戰建國、當有重大貢獻也、　（完）</p>

<p>據今天報載消息，第一海租界的形勢愈趨嚴重，日×外相與滬領事舉行重要會議，傳已最後决定採取　幹的方策（見十五日路邊社東京電）。第二，鼓浪嶼形態益形恐怖，日×方面竟提出五項無理要求，如澈底鎭壓抗日份子，如由日人担任工部同董事長警察總監與秘書長職務等（十五日本港士　西報戰日方同盟社廈門訊）。</p>
<p>我們曾經指出，日軍在鼔很嶼登陸，是與攫奪上海及天津租界有密切關係的，也可說是武裝刦佔上海及天津租界的試探工作。因此，這兩件事可說是同一事件。日×方面的主要企圖，大致是以下幾點：卽第一，因爲天津上海及其他租界租借地與萬國居留民地，是中日戰爭以來列强在華權益與中國沿海民族資本的最後根據地，爲日×久已垂涎的肥羊，近更急謀　奪，以謀補益其侵華軍事的經濟力量，同時打擊國際及民族資本之支持我持久抗戰的力量。第二，也是更重要的，是在於開始排出歐美列强在華及在遠果的全部利益與勞力，而達成其所謂「東亞新秩序」；此種舉動之特別選於目前歐局嚴重之際，更含有間接支持其盟友德意侵略者在歐洲的××行爲的　義，因此這種舉動也就是　西斯侵略者聯合進攻英法獎等民主和平國家的進一步的表現。第三，也是我中們國同胞特別是華南同跑所不容過分忽視的，是日×威脅上海租界，同時還企圖藉以打華我們正在開始進行的×軍後方戰鬥的經濟的政治的根據，而日×之在鼔浪嶼登睦，同時也在企圖藉以便利正在積極準備中的事事上的南進政策，特別是正在部署中的潮汕攻略！</p>
<p>我們認淸了日×這種陰謀企圖之後，一方面要加緊國際宣傳，說明日×此種舉動對於歐矣列強特別是英法美各國的游重的威脅，喚起民主和平各國加緊蘇聯援華制日的運動，以便保障其遠東權益和保障世界的安全秩序，另一方面，我們遼要加緊喚起僑胞對於日×比種陰謀的注意，加緊運動，×回國服務運動，特別是用一切力量以援助中央政府，×××××××××××，增强潮汕，閩粤贛邊和南路西江的防衞力量！</p>

<p>— 林家旅</p>
<p>【民革社晉西通訊稿】在陝北綏德的東關，一到了下午，便有無數的老鄕，背着糧食羊毛織物草紙狐貍皮…等等土産，從四周的鄉村裏，　集到這條街上來，當　　終年的心血，換成寥寥幾張花紙—鈔票—時，總順便帶一點什麽紅紅綠綠的洋布綢緞線襪等或一些五光十色的鈕扣別針…囘去贈給他們倚　懷望的老婆或閨女，一點一滴但是每目每日無數地帶，而籠着雙袖蹲在街頭攤前或靠在櫃檺上的老板們，總是源源不罄的供給着，到義合頭（綏城東六十里）三日一集時，這情形更熱鬧，我去探問那些魔術師老板們，他們都異口同聲地指示着，『過門』在磧口。到了河東磧口，嚇，五里路的長街，一座座温暖的客店，四方人客，川流不息的來往着。當我偶然跑進一個石印局，有賽皮面的筆　簿四角一本，新星牌的油印機，五十餘元一架。眞正老牌的崛井蠟紙，六元一筒。還有各色眞空管的自來水筆鉛筆墨水小刀華麗奪目的（東）洋便箋，菕到漢的西北第一次見到這樣漂亮的文具店。詢問店夥，他平淡地說：『太原來的！』</p>
<p>到了河東的臨縣，當我每次進飯館，一坐在桌子上，那活潑的小夥計，便異常認眞的來問我：『你用甚票子？』我莫明其妙瞪着他，他急忙歉意而堅决的解釋。『十元的鈔票，我們找不出，前次有幾位吃了三元多，我們也沒法，只能讓他欠下……』牆頭上貼着石印大字佈吿，望老百姓信任新省鈔，但是軍政民人等都感覺着用鈔票始終在驚扭着。有人說是零鈔票太缺乏，有人說是太原方一面操縱。</p>
<p>今天我找着一個剛自太原歸來之客，他替我解釋了這些神秘的謎，他是臨縣城裏一個大商號××的掌櫃，常常到太原去購貨。這種與×區的貿易，在在年舊歷四月間便盛行起來，一直到現去，絡釋不絕，每月平均有百餘人（有些是小賣買的鄉下人）。從前可以將這邊的貨運到那邊售脫，然後購買那邊的貨帶回來，這邊輸出的貨，主要的是麻與麻繩，其次是鹽，棉花等（現在那邊的棉花比這邊的還低）。進來的貨則有白毛細布白洋布斜紋布線嗶嘰直貢　煤油洋　紙鞋襪肥皂手電電池西藥等及種種日用品。現在我方禁止運貨出去，於是只能帶錢去購買。可是個人在×區發行大量的僞鈔，對于新山西省鈔是禁止使用，却大量吸收法幣，舊省鈔也允許使用，但完全由他操縱。在平常時，天津字樣的法幣，一元可値九角七分，其餘各種則僅値七八角，舊省鈔以前一元可換偽聯合準備銀行九角，最近的佈吿謂，二月二十日以後，减爲六成（一元只作六角）在三月十日以後，便完全禁止使用。所以現在晉西北的市面上，十元的新省鈔。使甩非常艱疑。而十元的法幣，可以有人用十一元來換。</p>
<p>他最近一次去太原，是舊曆十二月二日由臨縣起程，帶着一個同伴一個縣夫與兩頭牲口，從方山縣經靜樂南的晏煩而到向陽。向陽在太原城北三十里，其西北的蘭村，便駐着×人的重兵。但是向陽卻常有我們的隊伍去巡視，也有日軍帶着宣撫班去講道。他於七日進太原北門，途中只費六日，太原城的北門與南門開着可以通行，東門和西門則封閉着。城門口有兩個日兵與兩個中國僞警守衞着，日軍着黄呢軍服，荷槍，僞警則着草緑色制服，關邊軍帽，相徽是前總　時代的五角銅星，持木棒，進城時須向日人敬　，由日人指揮僞警檢查。很馬虎。只要胸前掛着良民證便可無阻礙地出入。（他從懷裏提出良民證秴我看。就是本地發的，一塊長方形的白布條，中間良民證三字，左邊寫若歲數，右邊寫着地名，再蓋上一顆臨縣商會的鈴記便是，在我方通過，另有護照，到向陽時，便寄放在那兒。）進出城門的人頗多。他們進城之後，便寄居在一家熟識的字號裏，不敢歇店，因爲常要撿查。非常危險。進城雖然容易，也會出亂子。在不久以前，臨縣城某店的夥計，到太原購貨，他替×軍某兵士梢一封家信，在進城時前，被換出來。當時便帶到城門側小屋子裏探詢，他解釋着，這信是綏德某傷兵醫院送到他櫃上，然後櫃上叫他梢來，其他一切不知道。僞書一面責他自找麻煩，同時却有開釋他的意思。可是日兵却很嚴属地將他帶到警備司令部去，睡了幾日冷堆皮，後來找人，證明他確是臨縣的商人，於是毫無碍難地釋放了，出來的那天，日官長很和藹的問他：『臨縣一帶駐的那一部份軍隊？有多少人？十九軍駐在那兒？他們對老百姓怎樣？』這些問題他含糊的答過去了。（有一次，××軍的便衣偵探，在離石城內爲×人發覺被捕，也未加害。却向他宣傳一套『中國抗戰已無勝利的希望。』</p>
<p>運貨出城是唯一的困難關鍵。在我方禁止貨物輸×後，×人也下令封鎖輸出。凡出城每人布只准帶一疋，糖只准五斤。……其他軍用品如西藥洋　斜紋布煤油等，嚴格查禁運出。但是他們仍自由地偷運着。有兩種法們：一種是設法賄買日本汽車，裝載了貨物，一直便衝出了城鬥。（現在太原有三部份汽車公司，×軍用的與商辦的及華商辦的。汽車路在向陽北的才被破壞。）一汽車需五十元。這種方法危險很大。上月裏有一輛汽偶然被查，除了連車帶貨沒牧之外，那一個掌櫃拘去了，用煤油倒　口鼻、受盡了虐刑、結果花了了三千多元、勉强買的一條殘生。客人倒都跑掉了。另一種們路比較可靠，是串通了僞公安局之後，用大橡皮汽車輪的牌子車。裝上貨物，蓋着一層油布。出城時偽警略一翻看，便讓通過，什麽東西都出得來二日兵亦佯作未察，大槪亦有染指，每牌子軍戰約一千四百餘斤，需賄洋三十餘元，他這次運貨出城，三次始得通過，第二次幾乎被扣。大概因爲錢化少了，這種手續，都由城內商人代辦，貨到向陽才知這需要多少錢。他這次七百多斤。化去二十元車錢，一同出城的有四大車，共一萬四千餘元貨，大部份是磧口和三交的。他因爲貨出不了城、便返留半月之久。太原的市面，跟抗戰前一樣繁華，讀書人很少，但商人大都安然地作着生意。不大關心戰事，但實際上是有很大的艱難的，第一是營業完全的無保障。他敍述一個實例；（這是他在城內時，發生於他認識一個字號）。那家的掌櫃，在某日從　銀行換了九百元「金票」，囘店途中，尾隨着兩個日兵，向他要換取，他未應允，到該日晚間，那兩日兵引着幾個武裝同伴，打進他店裏，逼着他開了錢櫃，將那原封未動的九百元拿去，並脅迫他交出其餘的儲蓄，一共搜括二千餘元，揚長而去。結果，那掌櫃事後還不敢　張，暗自忍受下去。第二是×人在金融上完全操蹤着發行着大量的空頭僞鈔。第三在同蒲路的生產工廠，都被日人接辦，如楡次許多紡織廠，太原的火柴烟草公司兵工廠等，都以原招牌出貨，而實際上完全爲日人賺利，所以現在無論國貨或洋貨，一切都是日貨。譬如太原的火柴上，因爲有×人荒謬的宣傳（反共倒×），禁止在這裏通用，而以汾陽的代替，其實汾陽一樣是日貨。這邊運銷最大的白毛細布斜衫布線嗶嘰直買緞等，都是楡次來的。白毛細布比抗戰前每疋（十二元）漒了一元之多，因爲×人以大批布疋運到洪趙換取棉花，總之，中國的商人是在×人完全扼制中苟延殘喘着，在太原的各種公共建築，都被日人佔据着，　路銀行，便是×人特務機　的一大本營。日人在太原市開辦着許多飯館茶餾窰子，另外一種生意，便是收買木料破銅爛鐵。</p>
<p>談到臨縣這一帶的商情，他覺得抗戰以後，並沒產生什麽特殊困難，似乎反比從前活動些，在現在輸出是沒有什麽。輸入貨物的銷品—一般消耗品比必需品大二倍。尤其是軍界政界需要的斜紋布洋蠟及各種日用品等佔其大宗。這些都靠太原方面供結，自己尙無法解决。目前他們最大的難題，便是×區將禁止使甲舊省鈔與法幣。他最希望的是「能運貨到×區售賣。」</p>
<p>他是汾陽人。他的家尙留居份陽南關，有時自己囘去看看。有時托人帶些錢去，似乎沒有必要將家救出×區。他吿訴我兩個最近發生在汾陽的故事：一，×人在今年（舊曆）一年來，招收了六百多中國壯丁，在城裏受訓六個月，主要的是敎日語，不許講中國話，到期滿的那一天，日人拿出許多漂亮的日軍黄呢制服和中國布軍服，令大家自由挑選。結果有三分二（四百餘人）選穿了黄呢制服，其餘穿了布軍服。當天晚上，前一批用火軍運到不知道的地方去了。後一批便担負了『維持地方治安』的偽警淸鄉隊等職務。二，有一次汾陽的日軍，驅使大批的中國壯丁在前去『淸鄉』，在城郊某地遇着××軍的×××旅，壯丁們大呼『我們是中國人！』××軍的同志們回答：『中國人掉轉槍頭！』於是四百多日兵完全被『淸』除。</p>
<p>他對于×區各種情形，及中國的抗戰，很少意見或感想，他們平日是不大思索和討論這個的，他對現在整個的戰况很模糊，雖然在×區跑進跑出，却沒什麽激動，我指着地圖示以他現在的中日軍事形勢，吿訴他中國初期抗戰必敗的原因，這是不足爲奇的，但是×人有某些致命弱點，而且一日一日的增大，我說，在我們的後方西南，現在政府是在努力開發新的大工業商業，訓練比×人更利害的新軍，而在×人的後方，有我們無數的正規軍游擊軍和港百姓，糾纒着×人，這還不算眞正攻擊×人，到了×人困難更大，我們新的力量長成，而國際友人更能帮助我們時，那便是我們眞正反攻的日子，一下就會把×人打出中國去了，遭時間是無法定期的，要看大家努力的程度怎樣。但這時期遲早是一定要來到的！他與其他的店夥都圍上來，非常注意的傾聽着，如夢初醒似地同意着。</p>
<p>記者以爲要免除×人的經濟操縱，須要在政治方面實施有計劃而嚴格地各種封鎖興限制。在經濟方面積極提倡各種手工業興必要的工　，以達到能自紿自足的境地。非兩方面同時進行不可。</p>
<p>同時，×人的懷柔政策，雖然不能終于掩飾其强暴的本質，現其甜蜜欺人的現象，對那些只知重利的商界同胞與忠實的　民，尤其是對半封建的中國社會本身存在着許多的弱點，是有其相當效果的，應該加強對×區同胞的宣傳工作，對於來往×區的人們，應特別名與他們談話，一方面　詢×區的各種實際情形，一方面增高他們的認識，不僅可以敎他們不發生錯誤的行動，還能藉之深刻地影響他人。　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c39">閑話港九涼茶館 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 白瑩</p>
<p>普羅階級工餘流連的唯一地方</p>
<p>香港的警羅階級，据一般的估計，至少佔一百二十多萬的全人口八成以上。因為普羅階級之多，於是商人　爲他們的生活打算，便有專爲他們而設的飯店茶樓。而那有別於普通茶樓的「凉茶舘」。也在　樣的社會背境裏誕生，迎合小市民們的需要。</p>
<p>假如我們從凉茶舘的鬥前經過時，首先觸於你的眼　的，是木　上擺着的一個二尺來高的黄銅葫蘆，初到香港的外省人，許會不知道他們葫蘆裏　的是什末東西吧？其實葫后裏的是十多味「生草　」。像苦　　，鬼羽箭或者茅根，竹　之，煎熬而成的茶，因爲他們的藥性是「凉」的，廣東人就叫作「凉茶」。</p>
<p>十多年前，這些凉茶舘都是因陋就簡地在一間狹隘的或半邊的舖裏放着幾把木　櫈木　，就做生意，有些簡單得可以的，　　　　邊一個不攤，上面放着幾碗　　　　個沙煲，沒有椅子，僱客　在在　前胡亂地喝完了，擲下一個銅板更　，後來，那些工於營謀的老板，獨運匠心，把他的生意擴張起外，租一所較大的　子，中央放一張長形餐　，兩　排着整齊的木橈。上面懸　美　的紙　串，並且開起留聲機唱片，僱一兩個女員招待僱客，面目一新，似模似樣地開張起來。同時，因為凉茶類多是苦味的，所以新興的凉茶舘，　兼　些賤價的糖果。苦和甜配台起來。果然，小市民們都趨之若鶩。蓝天髙朗滿座。　客如　。這風氣一開，不到半　眼紅行家便都相率仿效；並且勾心鬥角，點綴輝趨，爭聘年　貌美的女侍，吸引　客。</p>
<p>自是而後，凉茶舘便成爲小市民們唯一的消遣之地，他們于工餘之暇，只要口袋裏有幾個銷板。便可以　到這裏流連整整一個晚上。在這裏旣可以領略中西的時曲，也可以玩賞招展的「茶花」。他們踞坐長桌的兩旁，看樣子是那末地　哉悠哉，很寫意的啜一口凉茶，咬一件糖果。意到時，逗一下侍女們的歡笑，或者胡裏胡塗地需　些的國事，這樣地他們就可以從晚上八時一直坐到十一時，待消散了白天的疲勞，滿足了下意識的興趣，才悠然歸去，</p>
<p>才有些別闢蹊徑的，他們僱一個　於說書的「烟客」髙坐中堂，慢　烟喉，口沬四濺，說一回『五虎平南』，『　通掃北』，另一些　僱一個普者唱揚州腔調，也一般的能够吸引伲客。</p>
<p>開設凉茶舘的地點，自然不是皇后道中，鳳　台　，而是那劳苦大衆，中下層小市民叢集之區二在香港，一條荷李活道。從鴨已旬街起全大　地口止，就已經十餘檔有奇了。灣仔的交加街，春園街？也是他們生財之地。九二方面，上海街和廟南街至少有三十檔以上理。</p>
<p>凉茶舘的命名，多數是『西樵公』，『　山公』，『耕田公』之類，這種命名的取義，表示他是地道的『民鄕』，而鄕民在鄕間採得　道的草　，捉　草藥煎成的凉茶是頂瓜瓜的之意。</p>
<p>凉茶舘除　凉茶之外，還兼賣『龜苓膏』，差不多家家如是，如出一轍。『龜苓膏』是用金錢龜和土茯苓烹成的，據說不特可以淸毒去濕，最大的效果是醫治風流暗疾，所以，他們是不愁沒有主顧的。</p>
<p>有些凉茶舘的老板是　得幾味草藥湯頭兼　奇難什症的大夫，他們　着幾味草藥和一條『　　』的獨步單方，便褂起招　來，並　張一間生草藥店，一面就　　材，把些草藥煎熬凉茶發賣。</p>
<p>你不要小　　們的生意　微，其實，那是頂好幹的生意。在夏天，頂行時的幾家，每天可以有一百八十塊錢的生意。以七分利錴計，他們每天就乾脆　利五六十元了。置良田，蓋房子的，据說不少。</p>
<p>涼茶館生意　　的原因，除上述外，是一些人不很理知的傳說，香港的地　硫磺多，喝香港的水很容易發熱，所以　月非喝幾次凉茶不可。這麽一來，凉茶舘生意怎不鼎盛？</p>

<h3 id="c52">賣花女 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Pygmalion　米高梅公司出口　原著　蕭伯納　主演　李思廉霍華　溫悌希拉</p>
<p>在某幾點上，亨利希金敎授很不像個敎授模樣、事實上、他有個高而寬廣的、蘊藏着智　的前額、瘦削的臉上、總是顯露着一股嚴肅、這股嚴肅的神氣、再加上了他偶然戴用的玳瑁邊的眼鏡、更顯得是個學究了、但是他眼中却有着慈祥的光彩、當他笑時、那股嚴　的神氣也就消失了，</p>
<p>他確是一位敎授、一位著名的語音學敎授、他的巨著「希金氏國際字母』、世界各處都知道、所以他成了標準英語的發音的權威、在他的唐　街的屋子　有個很完備的實驗室、有各種記錄和分析語音的機件、他曾敎授過某富翁的妻子和女兒的準確的發音、</p>
<p>他有一種有趣的嗜好、也是他的二種誇矜、他能從人家的說詁聲音上聽出　人是生在英國那一處的、錯誤不會出六英里之外、如果是倫敦人、那就準確、甚至於可指出他是生在那一條街上的、昨天晚上、他同畢克林將軍在柯文花關外面等候汽車時、他還有意無意的、指出一個年輕賣花者是生在那一條街的呢、</p>
<p>那個貧苦齷齪的賣花女郞、起先很是　奇地望了他不作　、一會兒她却羞得惱怒起來了、</p>
<p>因爲他那時不小心的對畢克林將軍這樣說：「哎呀、你聽這聲音—以爲她會　苦一生　、哼、在三個月內我可以敎會她講費族社會的言語、冒充了公爵夫人去見政府大使呢、』</p>
<p>他說了這話，自己並不留神、今天、他引領他的客人畢克林觀看自己的得音的實驗室時、也許早把昨天的事完全忘記了、兩人都用全副精神注意在　雜而有趣的實驗電機上、空氣中充滿了一種電機上發出來的單調的營營聲、</p>
<p>「怎樣、聽這樣的聲音便你厭倦了吧、」希金最後這樣問、</p>
<p>二人靜默了一會、畢克林燃點了紙烟、說道：「我實在聽辨不出那些聲音有什麽不同』、</p>
<p>『啊呀』、希金又窘又駭奇、他微笑了一笑、便指一架裝着喇叭的錄昔機給畢克林看、隨後又指指一個看來　是做　設的小佛像說：</p>
<p>『秘密的傳音筒』、話未說完。有人敲門、他就叫道：「誰、是密昔司彼　　」、</p>
<p>那個管家婦說：『先生、外面有個年輕的女子要見你、一個很平常的女郞、我本想囘絕她、只因爲——』她嘆了口氣——「你有時也接見奇怪的客人的呢」、</p>
<p>門首站　一個女郎，苗條的身子上穿着一件不合身的　價的黑色衣服、衣服太緊狹了些、倒益加　出她的靑春的</p>

<p>— 陳遂賢</p>
<p>許多體育的朋友、還是猶豫徘徊的態度、一方面是贊許德員的體育、另一方面贊揚蘇聯的體育，這種矛眉的現象、是沒有認　體育的本質、以爲德意的體育和蘇聯的體育一樣、就是過去的體育和社會科學沒有密切的聯系、德意的體育宣傳、是「體育國防」、蘇聯的體育宣傳、也是「體育國防』的、誰都知道有侵略的國家、然後產生國防的國家、實在誰是體育國防，事，勝於雄辯、亞比西尼亞和阿爾巴尼亞不是意大利的法西的侵略者所滅亡嗎，奧大利和捷克不是德意志的法西的侵略者所滅亡囑，所以體育和政治是有因果的關係、我們在這里還看不出誰是對的、如果我們盲目　進行、很容易做了法西的走狗的危險、因爲法西所提倡的體育、用來破壞人類的和平、一方面注重軍事體育、增强侵略的力量、另一方　去訓練貴族化的體育的選手、去爭國　的錦標、如最近意大利的網球選手集中訓練、就是一例，這些選手將來能够稱覇世界、就可以做　際的職業的網球家，去替國家有所出息、這就是法西的體育訓練的目的、反觀蘇聯的體育、普及全民　育、不論城市或農村、都有同樣的機會享受訓練、如全國用播音早操就是一個很好的例證，從來沒有見到蘇聯集中訓練選手夫參加國際的任何錦標賽、給那些不明體育本質的錦標主義者看來、確是莫名其妙、</p>
<p>凡是澈底認織體育的眞理，都知道體育訓練是人生一切的出發點、又是社會一切納出發點、也是人數征復自然的一切的出發點、××××××××××××××××××××××、一場網球或拳擊的　標賽、一次入場券的收人、達百數十萬元，凡能參加比赛的選手、就成一個脊產偕級了！這樣的體育、能够算是人生的出發點嗎？又能够算是社會有生產的份子囑？××××××××××××××××××××××××</p>
<p>我們要知道中國是農業的國冢、農衆的社會、×××××××××××××××××、也是敎育不普及的國家、一切貴族化的錦標主義的體育、絕對不適合的、不但在客觀環境所不能接納、、而且增加深一層的矛盾、××××××××××××××××、但我很相信讀者諸友中、一定也有不少是有同樣的見感，讓我們借着現實的火光奔向碧綠的友情的原野吧、世間上沒有那一種精神力量是能够　　現實而孤立的，『友情』也不能例外、但目前我們的友情决不同於『五四』所提倡體育的那種友情、因為我們口在所處的社會環境和以前所處的、是完全不同的、就是國爲不同、我們要把現實的體育的眞理、只有互相勉　、共同奮鬥、更要火速的把握體育去配合這偉大的民族解放的戰爭、同時要把體育的眞理向全國廣播、</p>
<p>正當我們民族在滅亡線的難苦的時候、我們要不分階級、也不分派別、在共同的利害共同的目標之下、締　鐵一般的堅固　比的友情的共同戰線、　（完）</p>

<p>上海為製粉業中心</p>
<p>麵粉為我國主要食糧之一、北方人民食之者尤衆、故需要甚爲普遍、機製粉廠、全國共有九十三家、遍佈各省市、然大量供給者、仍首推上海一地、全國機製麵粉出口經通商口岸者、自上海出口者、佔百份之九六、故上海不特爲長江流域製粉業之中心、實亦全國麵粉供給之策源地，上海麵粉廠共有十五家、全年產粉數量、爲一千萬公担、佔全國產量、二分之一以上、戰後淪陷區域、各廠被迫停歇、勉强開工者、爲福　、卑　、等數　、產粉數量、較戰前大减、</p>
<p>日粉輸入壟斷華北</p>

<h3 id="c63">談死 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>死，本來有重於泰山輕於鴻毛之分的，所謂重於泰山，不外乎「殺身成仁，舍生取義』：惟其能如此而死，則其名垂　册，可與日月爭光，天地同　，雖死猶生，此其所以謂重於泰山也。</p>
<p>但成仁取義，似乎也應有一過程。就是說：應殺身而殺身，棧可叫做成仁；應舍生而舍生，繼可呌做取義，若留貿然殺身舍生，這就未必可謂達到成仁取義的目的。孟子裏有兩個故事，說明這一件事，我先把他引　下面：</p>
<p>曾子居武城，有越寇，或曰：寇至，盍去諸！』曰：「無寓人於我室，毀傷其薪木。』寇退，則曰：「修我牆屋，我將反。」寇退，曾子反。左右曰：「待先生如此其忠日敬也，寇至，則先去，以爲民望；寇退則反，殆於不可。』　猶行曰：「是非爾所知也。昔沈猶言負芻之禍，從先生者七十人。未有與焉。』子思居於衛，有齊寇，或曰：一寇至。盡去諸！」子思曰；「如伋去，君誰與守？」孟子曰；「曾十子思同道。曾子，師也，父兄也；子思，臣也，微也。曾子子思，易地則皆然。」這是說，爲師與爲臣不同，所以寇至，則得去，一朋不得去，因爲曾子只爲人師，手無寸鐵，卽使殺身舍生，也未必可謂成仁取義。子思身爲大臣，自應爲國忘身，雖至殺身舍生，總能成爲成仁取義。所以孟子批評他們，以爲曾子子思，其道實同，如果變換環境。兩人都能如此。</p>
<p>或者要說：這樣說來，只有做大臣的殺身舍生，可以成仁取義；做細民的，即使殺身舍生，也未爲成仁取義了，但這話並非如是，諸葛亮在後出師表中有云：「鞠躬盡瘁死而後巳。」文天祥在自贊中有云：「惟其義盡，所以仁至。」這兩個一盡」字，實在値得我們注意。這盡字無異指示人以積極的意思，我們必須積極爲國努力，而至於竭盡其力之後，方才可以一死了之。在未竭盡其力以前，我們實不用死，也是不可死的。文天祥與元相博羅　答，有一段很可爲我們作注解，原文如此</p>
<p>博羅云：「且道古時曾有人臣，將宗廟城郭土地分付與別國人了，又逃走去，有此人否？』予（指天祥）曰，「奉國與人，是賣國之臣也，賣國者，有所利而爲之。我前日除宰相不拜，奉使伯顏軍前，尋被拘執，巳而有賊臣者獻國，國亡，我本當死，所以不死者，以度宗皇帝二子在浙東，老母在廣，故爲去之耳。」又曰，你立二王，做得甚功勞？』予曰：「國家不幸喪亡，予立君以存宗廟，存一日，則臣子盡一日之責，伺功勞之有？」曰：「旣知做不得，何必做？」曰：「人臣事君，如子事父，父不幸有疾雖明知不可爲，豈有不下藥之理，盡吾心焉。今日文天祥在此有死而巳，何必多言—」</p>
<p>所謂當死而所以不死，乃因尙可立君以存國家：所謂旣知做不得　必做，乃因國家存在一日，必盡爲臣一日之心，不能因國亡而卽消極之念，不能因事不可爲而卽失積極之心，必至心力供盡，然後一死，此所謂一當死不死，可爲即爲；眞不可爲，則惟死爾。」（元許有壬文丞相傳序語）這　的死，　是光明磊落，浩長氣存，重干泰山，而値得我們歌頌，</p>
<p>今日的中國，正處于堅苦抗戰的時代，也必須人人能存這樣積極的觀念，以國家民族爲至上，以軍事勝利爲第一，矢志　它，堅持到底，則抗戰自能必勝，建國自能必成。所謂當死不死，有爲卽爲，明知環境困難，工作非易，如伺跡出這個環境，去到有和場所，奮鬥工作，萬不能略存消極之念，以殺身爲勇敢，以舍生爲正義，此種得不償失，旣無補於自身，也無益於國族，徒作無謂的犧牲，只可認爲懦弱的表示，因有感於報上所載不願出賣　竣往往自盡的新聞，拉　書此，以爲留居孤島的人士作進一步言。</p>
<h3 id="c64">波瀾 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>

<p>小河裏，濱溝內。污　的死水，是大地上最吳惡的東四，那裏祇有細菌在跳躍，孑孑在歌唱，綠的浮萍，靑的盧葦，永還不會和他們作伴。</p>
<p>湖內，河裏，靜靜的流水，潺潺的微聲，似乎沒有多大的生氣，空間中，太寂寞了，太幽沉了！停留在那裏，起了無限的懶意。</p>
<p>最值得讀揚的，是江海中的波瀾，牠是多麽的浩蕩，在岸邊的　　的聲音，更是雄偉—</p>
<p>這象徵者人生，美的人生，該有着波瀾般的毅力，它不會那麽靜。毫無聲息的，被世人忘懷丁—</p>

<p>設想着獨步於桃源或邀遊上海；歸結茅屋在無人知曉之鄉，如　逸之士般。這片還熱常使我徜徉於迷　的道路中良久。</p>
<p>現實的鞭子却殘酷的從背後策過來，遂把我從夢幻中驚醒。抬起頭，我深自驚異，世界多遼闊？生活是什　？人生是夢？</p>
<p>問號底銳利的　鈞抓牢我的　子，於是　愼的找　着答案。我關始學習，學習怎樣活下去。</p>
<p>朋友說：「我企求着一個變，你來拿起我的斃杖吧！』但，我又朝　　　述呢？向人間伸出求助的手，誰頤把我領上生活的大道呢？</p>
<p>活在別人的憐憫與同情裏不是可恥的嗎？我又躇躇了。抽回手，却邁起腳，我要仗着自己的力去走，眞理的路上决不會缺乏同道的伙伴。但我們不該長節着，向別人伸出蒼白的手。倦了，就倒下了，算得什麽？我們巳　　最後一口氣，爲了開路。一滴血，在歷史上便是一個　跡，完整的一頁，是痕　累成的。</p>
<p>棄掉朝後者的灰色鏡片吧，不要牢記着昨天，過逝掉的伺必苦苦追悼，惋惜呢，幹麽老在昔日的庭院中徘徊，做一個留連光景的人</p>
<p>我們要學習揭棄過去還留下醜惡的遺產，握緊今天　不要在一聲太息中放過每個貢昏，到明天，就是新的日子，有歡悅，有幸福，有太陽的日子，是為誓。</p>
<h3 id="c66">爭之門 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 汪青</p>
<p>破曉時候，天上稀疏的還掛奢幾顯淡贡色的晨星，大地被一層　　籠罩住，四周只有不淸楚的房屋和街這的輪耶；人們尙在温暖的好夢　，等待一個巨大的　聲來把他們喚醒。</p>
<p>一個靑年沉着而帶有堅决的脚步聲，在空氣裏　漾開釆，面孔沉沒在霧氣裏，他在一個開着的大門前站住了，對牆上望了一眼，牆的兩面各有　色的「爭鬥」兩個大字，他毫不遲疑地想舉足跨進門去，突然門內出現了一個白　髮的老人，用手攔阻了他，明朗的宇句從老人口內吐了出來。</p>
<p>『喂！你來做什麼？』</p>
<p>「我要入這爭　之鬥。』聲音似無波的海一樣的平和，沉靑，一個字斷續的說着，『去爭鬥』！</p>
<p>老人的面目很莊嚴：「每天不知道有多少人到這裏來，但有很多的是進去了又回出來，……』</p>
<p>「不，我不會再回來，除非我得到了我所要求的東西以後：我是抱了最大的决心到這裏來的。』</p>
<p>「你經的是什麼呢？是不是像他們一樣要在這「爭國」裏得着生存和解放？」</p>
<p>「是的，我要的就這個。我們被人家欺侮得太够了，我們　要猛省，以牙還牙。他們以前的不承認我們，但如今有新的生命了，起來爭　了。」</p>
<p>「爭鬥，你要知道這不是隨口說的：你探頭進來看看，這眞。呵！這裏！這裏只有死亡。」說着老人便　開了身子。</p>
<p>他探頭進去一看。裏面地上全是鮮紅的以及紫黑的血，東一堆西一堆的是白骨。更有慘呼聲，詛咒聲，憤怒聲打成一片，很覺得陰慘怕人，而他却不怕，不，他巳望見這後面的光明了，他更堅决更沉着的說，</p>
<p>「死亡和流血並不使我心寒，為了求生存解放，死亡流血乃是必須的，我早把這丢開了。』</p>
<p>『死亡和流血不使你顧盧。但是你回過頭去看看。你家裏的母親，弟妹，愛人，他們在焦急的等你回去。給你撫慰，給你愛；還有那　人的音樂，　郁的葡萄酒，他們也在等你去享受呢。這一切又是多麽的可愛呢，還是囘到那寫去罷。」</p>
<p>「享受嗎？享受現在巳不是時候了，讓那些東西去　　罷，至於我的親人呢，我想他們不久也要到這爭　之門內來了，爲了他們的生存和解放。　一切的愛在　爭鬥之門內生長起來。』</p>
<p>「靑年，進來罷—我預祝你勝利，而且我永還的祝驅着你，願你成功。』</p>
<p>那靑年感　地跨進了爭鬥之門，向裏面望去，突然那陰慘的一切都化爲烏有了，遍地都開着血的花，似乎在點頭對他微笑。</p>
<p>他又抬頭：光明正在前面升起來了。</p>

<p>— Min Kang (Sent from Mangshi)</p>
<p>(Special Article) With the persistence and deepening of the War of Resistance, Yunnan, which has traditionally received little attention, has transformed into a central base for the political, economic, and cultural spheres, as well as for international transportation in the rear. The vast Yi ethnic region in western Yunnan's border area is precisely the essential route for our southwest's international transportation line, and its importance in the War of Resistance is self-evident. This time, the reporter was fortunate to have the rare opportunity to visit the border area of western Yunnan; however, given the limited time, I could not conduct long-term and in-depth observations, and could only seek a superficial understanding. Nevertheless, considering the importance of the border area in the War of Resistance, I am eager to introduce the general living conditions and social circumstances of the Yi ethnic compatriots on the Yunnan border, hoping to provide a modest reference for friends who are concerned about border area issues and those who pay attention to ethnic minority questions.</p>
<p>Types of Yi People</p>
<p>The Yi people scattered throughout the western Yunnan border area consist of approximately eight types: Spiny Yi (sometimes written as Zhuan Yi), Mountain Head Yi (commonly known as Savages), Achang Yi, Suluo Yi, Bengshi Yi, Kawa Yi, Kala Yi, and Han Chinese who have migrated from the interior. Among these, the Spiny Yi have the largest population and are the closest to being assimilated into Han culture. They are naturally timid and deeply submissive. Second are the Mountain Head Yi, who come in two types: one that lives permanently in the mountains and rarely comes down, with a relatively strong nature; and the type that frequently comes down the mountain to attend markets, which are somewhat better. In the past, they were accustomed to robbing and killing in the markets, but after the Tusi's (local chieftain) soldiers implemented suppression in the markets, they no longer dare to do so. The Suluo Yi, like the Mountain Head Yi, enjoy drinking very much. The men are fierce and injure people when drunk, a temperament similar to that of the Savages. The Achang Yi are originally of Burmese blood and have recently gradually assimilated into Han culture. The Bengdong Yi originally lived in the mountains, but due to the bullying and oppression of the Mountain Head Yi, most have now moved to the plains. There are two types of Kawa: raw Kawa and cooked Kawa. The cooked type is still acceptable, but the raw type simply still has a taste for cannibalism. However, they do not eat their own kind but prefer to eat people from other ethnic groups, especially foreigners and Han Chinese. However, this group is small in number and lives in caves in the mountains. The Kala Yi are very few in number, and they have mostly assimilated into Han culture, with living habits similar to those of Han Chinese. As for the Han Chinese who have migrated there, their numbers are quite large, second only to the Yi. The majority still retain the characteristics of Han Chinese, but a minority have become Yi-ized due to their long generations there.</p>
<p>Seasonal Climate</p>
<p>The border area is mostly mountainous, with most areas experiencing a tropical climate, cool in the mornings and evenings, and hot and humid at midday. It is said that the miasma there is extremely severe and terrifying, but in reality, it is not so. Before we arrived in Mangshi and Zhejie, there was much discussion and apprehension in the car. Some said they were afraid, some said they were not, and some said that even if one need not be afraid, one should not disbelieve. As a result, phrases like "Don't eat at the guest house" and "Wake up early when you sleep" became our motto. Illusory Xia miasma and Edge Xia miasma are said to appear on mountain tops in the morning, while Black Water miasma and Frog miasma arise from the ground. Coupled with legends like that of the Mute Spring, it was simply terrifying. However, upon arriving at our destination, our friends there told us that we must eat our fill at every meal and wake up early in the morning, because sleeping in too much would only cause headaches. The midday heat and humidity were indeed somewhat oppressive, and I always felt dizzy and uncomfortable sitting in the armchair, so I joked to that friend, "If those miasma theorists were to sit in this chair, they would have discovered a new type of 'armchair miasma'!" The seasonal climate there is such that spring and winter are relatively clear, refreshing, and warm; and there is very little miasma. I heard people say that in the summer and autumn seasons, due to the heavy rainfall, coupled with unsanitary conditions in the streets and everywhere else, the rainwater would accumulate and then be exposed to the sun, causing these foul vapors to evaporate. Even without miasma, it would naturally turn into miasma. Many Han Chinese move back to the interior during these two seasons and return there after the seasons have passed. Blaming it on mysterious and strange miasma instead of working hard on sanitation is one of the many ways in which Chinese people are lazy.</p>
<p>Ten Tusi</p>
<p>In the western Yunnan border area, there are ten Tusi regions, each with its own Tusi acting as a local emperor, living in peace with each other. These ten Tusi are: Dao Chengxuan of Qianya Tusi, whose family has been inheriting this good position since the early Ming Dynasty, with over 5,000 households in the area, totaling about 20,000 people, mostly Yi people; Nanjian Tusi, also inherited from the early Ming Dynasty, with 8,000 households in the area, totaling over 30,000 people, mostly Han Chinese; Lai Fengyuan of Husa Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty to the present, with 500 households in the area, totaling about 1,500 people, mostly Achang Yi; Si Hongbi of Zhanjie Tusi, also inherited from the early Ming Dynasty, with 3,000 households in the area, totaling about 12,000 people, mostly Zhuan Yi; Fang Kesheng of Mangshi Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty, with over 5,700 households in the area, totaling about 28,000 people, mostly Spiny Yi; Duo Yingpei of Zhaofang Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty to the present, with over 1,000 households in the area, totaling about 2,700 people, mostly Mountain Head Yi and Zhuan Yi; Jiang of Mengban Tusi, inherited from the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, with over 150 households in the area, totaling about 620 people, mostly Han Chinese; Duo Yong'an of Suichuan Tusi, inherited the Tusi position from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty, with over 1,900 households in the area, totaling about 7,300 people, mostly Zhuan Yi; Dao Baotu of Mengmao Tusi, inherited from the early Ming Dynasty, with 1,400 households in the area, totaling about 2,700 people, mostly Spiny Yi; Gai Bingquan of Husa Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty, with 550 households in the area, totaling about 1,650 people, mostly Achang Yi. These Tusi were mostly officers who followed the generals on expeditions to pacify the Yi people during the Ming Dynasty, such as the Yizhuangsi, so they have a history of hereditary rule of four to five hundred years. Most of them are Han Chinese, but today they have also become Yi-ized to varying degrees. Most of the Tusi can speak Chinese, but their literacy is often limited. Only Dao Baotu is proficient in writing. Among the others, Fang Yuzhi, the agent of the minor Tusi (Mangshi), speaks relatively fluently and is relatively more adept.</p>
<p>Social System</p>
<p>The social system of the Yi ethnic region is, on one hand, a primitive agricultural society and hunting society, and on the other hand, it is a feudal system where the Tusi occupies all the land and implements severe exploitation. Speaking of the Tusi, he is the highest authority in the region, possessing the power of life and death. Even today, when Yi people see the Tusi, they must kneel. The Yi people themselves do not own land; they only cultivate for the Tusi. Each year, in addition to handing over 30 to 60 percent of the harvest to the Tusi, there are many expenses that must be offered to the Tusi as tribute. These expenses mainly include: the Tusi family's birth expenses, marriage expenses, the Little Tusi's enthronement ceremony expenses, birthday celebration expenses, funeral expenses, expenses for festivals such as Mid-Autumn Festival and Dragon Boat Festival, New Year's gift expenses, ploughing expenses, Frost's Descent festival expenses, the Tusi family's firewood expenses, border demarcation conference expenses, market expenses, Bao Gang expenses, and so on. These expenses are mostly distributed by the so-called Tou (now renamed Township Chief), on behalf of the Tusi, to each village (i.e., each township). In Yi society, women work more than men, but it is a patriarchal society. However, the Tusi's power only extends to the Spiny Yi and the Han Chinese residing in the Yi ethnic region. He cannot control or exploit the Savages and Suluo in the mountains. The Savages or Suluo have their own village chiefs or mountain officials in the mountains, but these mountain officials do not have the same power of life and death as the Tusi. Only during wartime (against other ethnic groups or other villages) do the mountain officials have the power to command all the villagers. In addition, in Yi society, monks and clergy have a high status, and the Yi people respect them. If the Tusi's behavior is inappropriate, the Yi people dare not and have no right to speak up; only the monks can say a few words, but naturally, there are limits.</p>
<p>Yi People's Occupations</p>
<p>Here, the officials in the Tusi's yamen, the township chiefs, village chiefs, and neighborhood chiefs, the teachers in schools, and the monks in temples are already close to the ruling class, and they are few in number. Ordinary Yi people do not have the opportunity to assume these positions. The general occupation of the Yi people is mainly farming, cultivating for the Tusi, which accounts for the vast majority. The second is doing small business, which is for a group with some small assets. They rely on a small amount of capital to make a living through trading. The Han Chinese in the border area mostly belong to this category. In addition to holding a market fair every five days, the Yi ethnic region has no market activity or shops on weekdays. However, there is always a little market activity on Han Chinese Street in Mangshi and the streets where Han Chinese are concentrated in various regions, such as a few food shops and general stores. However, the Yi people are not yet accustomed to it, so these small shops are relatively busy only on market days, and their business is very slow on weekdays. Other occupations include small handicrafts and casual labor, such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and those who hull rice for others. The textile industry is not yet developed in the Yi ethnic region. Only a small number of families can be seen with Yi children weaving, and the tools and artistry are very primitive, so production is almost nonexistent. Therefore, the clothing problem of the Yi people is still very serious, relying almost entirely on outside sources.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>The border area has a hot climate and plenty of rainfall, making it very suitable for crops. However, due to poor planting methods and a lack of understanding of the use of fertilizers, and only practicing two crops per year, the land has not been fully utilized. In more progressive areas, they have already achieved one crop of rice and one crop of miscellaneous grains per year, alternating them. The main products there include rice, wheat, opium, vegetables, fruits, beans, coffee, and a small amount of kapok. Except for the excellent quality of the rice (some resemble the Changshu rice of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but some say that it is not easily digestible, so it is not good), opium is the most prosperous product, because many mountainous areas are suitable for growing it, but this prosperity is naturally not a good thing. In addition, there are few varieties of vegetables. The main reason is that they only have the old methods passed down, and they do not have other vegetable seeds to experiment with. The taste of the fruits is not good and is completely different from what we have tasted in other tropical regions. I first tried sugar cane, and it was not sweet at all. Later, I bought some bananas to try. After eating two, I only felt sour and astringent and had no appetite. This made me afraid to try the papaya. Other products such as coffee are also produced in small quantities. As for timber and bamboo, there are few in the plains, but they are everywhere in the mountains. As for the minerals underground, because they are still well hidden underground, there is no way to talk about them, but according to general observations, they are said to be very abundant.</p>
<p>Religious Beliefs</p>
<p>Among the Yi people, the Spiny Yi are the most devout Buddhists, while the other Yi generally worship polytheism and animism. That is to say, they worship everything they see, believing that there is a god in every object. In areas where the Spiny Yi are concentrated, there are many temples dedicated to Gautama Buddha. In the Mangshi area alone, there are said to be over fifty temples. At a temple called Bodhi Temple, I learned from a head monk who could speak some Chinese that their busiest festivals are the New Year's festival in January, the Jinwo festival in June, and the Chuwo festival in September, and these three festivals are the most prosperous. The offerings that the Yi people make to the gods are incense, candles, and fresh flowers, and they do not burn paper objects. The monks' food and clothing are provided by the people; they eat and use whatever is sent to them and do not rely on temple property. It is said that the temple has no property. I asked him how many meals he ate a day, and he said he only ate one meal. I did not quite believe it, because he was too fat. Compared to a thin little monk next to him, this was questionable. However, during the conversation, I saw an Yi woman carrying some things straight into the inner room. I was surprised at first, but then I remembered what Lu Xun said: "If monks don't have wives, where do the little monks come from?" and was relieved. In another family, I walked in, and they were having dinner. The head monk and another person were eating four dishes each: stir-fried ham with cabbage, stewed ham, bean sprouts, and pickled vegetables (a dish that Yi women must know how to make, because before she gets married, her fiancé will ask her if she knows how to make this dish). It is openly known that monks eat meat here. The Mountain Head Yi greatly respect Zhuge Kongming, because legend has it that the Southern Expedition of Seven Captures of Meng Huo was directed at them. In Zhaofang, one day I wanted to go up the mountain to see the life of the Savages, but I had to have armed escorts for protection. I suddenly thought that if I had known when I came, I could have brought a Bagua robe and a feather fan for acting, and I could have swaggered up the mountain alone and acted with impunity.</p>
<p>Culture and Education</p>
<p>It is a wrong to say that the Yi people have no culture; it is a fact that they use little writing or have writing but do not use it. Yi writing is more widely used. The writing of the Mountain Head Yi was created for them by American missionaries. At the same time, each type of Yi people has one or several of their own languages. In addition, there are also a few who study Chinese. In recent years, the government has paid attention to the education of the Yi people in the border area, allocating considerable funds and entrusting the Tusi to run schools locally, mostly at the primary school level. In a Spiny Yi's house, I asked a student to take out his books for me to see. One book was a Primer for Children, which, in addition to Chinese, had some English printed on it. One was a Commercial Press edition of natural science, one was a textbook on the Three Principles of the People, and one was a text written in a language I did not understand at all. I asked him what grade he was in, and he replied that he was in the fourth grade, which was divided into six grades. English was not read until the second grade. School is only in session for five or six months each year, and it is already April in the solar calendar, but their annual holiday has not yet ended. Mangshi is the most progressive area, with a total of eighteen schools, with approximately forty or ninety students per school, totaling approximately seven or eight hundred primary school students. This is still according to the Tusi himself. In addition, temples also accept students, but they can only learn some Yi classics, and they also wear small kasayas when studying. After they have learned well, they can become monks or return to secular life as they please. Before there were schools, it was the only holy place for learning. Yi writing is very close to Burmese, and the British used Burmese to spread their culture by setting up Mountain Head schools, etc.</p>
<p>Customs and Habits</p>
<p>The most important festival for the Yi people each year is related to their water festival. The only expression of the grand festival is the joy of the young men and women. The seven days after the Qingming Festival is their so-called Water Splashing Festival, which is when men and women splash cold water on each other for fun, regardless of whether they know each other or not, and they can splash water at will. This is an opportunity for them to find partners. There are also two festivals, Jinwo and Chuwo, which are originally festivals for people over the age of forty to go to the temple to worship Buddha, but young men and women are also particularly lively during these two periods and flirt with each other. Marriage expenses for the Yi people, except for the Tusi and his relatives, are relatively simple. In the past, the conditions for marriage were very harsh. Currently, the Tusi stipulates that, for example, in Zhaofang, roughly one hundred and fifty rupees, eighty bowls of wine (approximately five to six jin), and eighty pieces of meat (approximately two hundred jin) are enough to marry a wife. If even this cannot be produced, there is still a way to make up for it: abduction. That is, the man takes the woman away, and the mother-in-law will naturally chase after them, but you escape east, and she chases west. This is originally to save face. After three or four weeks, when the couple returns home, the relatives will persuade them and give a small gift, and that is the end of the matter. Currently, it is said that abduction is more common than arranged marriage. One day we went to see a bride, and all we heard was the deafening sound of dozens of women crying in the room, and the tone was the same. I suspected that we had gone to the wrong place, that this was a funeral home. Only after asking did I know that this was saying goodbye to the bride. All of the bride's female friends had to cry in unison. Funerals are relatively even simpler. A thin coffin is carried quietly to the mountains by a few clansmen and buried, and the tombs are built less than a foot above the ground. The Tusi stipulates that commoners' graves are not allowed to have tombstones or leave names. After a long time, their descendants will not be able to find the tombs of their ancestors. However, we saw that the Tusi's tombs were very large and had official titles engraved on them. The tombs of monks are made in the shape of pagodas, with inscriptions by the Tusi. The gifts that the Yi people send to funerals are mostly two bamboo tubes of rice and two to three hundred small coins (approximately three mao). In terms of clothing, the Spiny Yi are the cleanest. The clothes of the Savage women are black, and they wear large rings in their ears. In terms of food, three sentences can express it: sour Spiny Yi, fishy Savage, stinky Kawa. The Savages live in the mountains, and they mostly live by hunting and do less farming. When eating, one can still see the symbol of the absence of a production system, which is that regardless of size, host or guest, each person has two packets of rice, regardless of whether it is enough or not. The Yi people like to eat betel nuts, which turn their teeth black, their lips blood red, similar to the Annamese. But progressive young women have learned that white teeth are beautiful. The Yi people often move to another Tusi area to seek land to cultivate if they do not like this Tusi. Because the Yi people have nothing of value, it is extremely easy to move. There is a saying: "When Yi people move, they don't need more than three loads," so their mobility is extremely high.</p>
<p>Male-Female Relationships</p>
<p>The social interaction between young Yi men and women is relatively free, unlike that of the Han Chinese. They regard courtship as an open and aboveboard act, with no concealment or hypocrisy. There are two common places for courtship: the mountains and the rice mill. The method of courtship is singing. Men sing and women answer, expressing their love for each other. In the evening, we can see a row of young men squatting in front of each rice mill, because it is cool at night, and they are all draped in a blanket. The people working in the rice mill are mostly young women. The men are ranked in front and back according to their singing skills. The one who sings the best squats in the first position and sings first. After he sings well, the second one continues. The women listen inside and sing back. If she agrees, she may also come out and talk with him for a while before going back to work. The most interesting thing is that behind a group of young men, there is also a string of children following, squatting down, draped in a small blanket, and also humming along with their brothers. They are not seeking partners. I call them "trainees." In the mountains, they sing mountain songs completely. There are many people. I asked a Yi who understood some Chinese to translate for me. According to his not-very-fluent Chinese, it can be roughly translated like this: The men sing first; (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e3">On the Wartime Administrative Guidelines of Guangdong Province <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Affairs Council recently passed a set of Wartime Administrative Guidelines for Guangdong Province and ordered its subordinates to implement them as soon as possible. The original plan includes three major areas: First, in terms of reforming politics, it begins with "supporting the good and punishing the bad," and "praising loyalty and righteousness while eliminating traitors," to promote righteousness, which can also be said to be the embodiment of the spiritual mobilization movement, and will greatly help enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence. Second is "implementing joint office of the provincial government," "clarifying powers and responsibilities, streamlining redundant positions," "improving the organization of townships and Baojia," and "improving the administrative structure of guerrilla areas," which are the basic steps of "adjusting the administrative structure" that have long been echoed by all parties. The third is "eliminating corruption," "selecting the virtuous and capable," "strictly implementing performance appraisals," and "cultivating cadres," which are not only the main methods for rectifying officialdom but also the prerequisites for improving politics. In addition, such as training local militias and police, eliminating the seven types of bad elements and traitors to stabilize the local area; such as expanding anti-Japanese national construction propaganda, intensifying mass organization and training, popularizing national military training, and encouraging the masses to assist in military affairs to effectively mobilize the masses; such as improving conscription methods and providing preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on expeditions, to encourage military service and support the protracted war; and such as intensifying relief work, promoting wartime sanitation, strictly prohibiting opium and gambling, especially protecting returned overseas Chinese, encouraging overseas Chinese to develop industries, and facilitating remittances for overseas Chinese, are all essential measures to adapt to the current situation and enhance the political power of Guangdong Province. Second, in the economic field, regarding the rectification of finance, it was decided to implement measures such as "rectifying the tax system," "abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes, prohibiting arbitrary levies," "rectifying county and city finances," "determining autonomous funding," "establishing treasuries in various places," and "maintaining debt credit"; regarding the activation of finance, it was decided to implement measures such as "promoting provincial bonds to stabilize finance," "strictly prohibiting the circulation of counterfeit currency," "developing the business of provincial banks," "adjusting finance in war zones," "encouraging thrift and savings," and "promoting agricultural and industrial lending"; regarding the promotion of land administration, it was decided to implement measures such as "designating areas for land consolidation experiments," "continuing land surveying and registration," and "improving procedures for reclaiming wasteland"; regarding the development of industries, it was decided to implement measures such as "reorganizing and developing provincial enterprises," "encouraging industry," "promoting agricultural production," and "developing important mineral resources"; in addition, concrete measures were also decided regarding the rectification of transportation, management of trade, and improvement of accounting. These measures not only fully adapt to the urgent needs of Guangdong in the War of Resistance but also lay the foundation for future national construction. Third, in terms of culture, the administrative guidelines clearly stipulate: "implementing wartime curriculum," "promoting compulsory education," "enriching wartime social education facilities," "assisting teachers and students withdrawing from war zones," "promoting nomadic people's education," "ensuring educational funding," and "increasing the efficiency of educational administration" to develop education for the War of Resistance and national construction. At the same time, it also stipulates "promoting inherent culture," "promoting scientific research," and "developing wartime art," which are important steps to mobilize the strength of the whole nation to support the War of Resistance, and promote a new enlightenment movement to establish an ideal new China of the people, by the people, and for the people.</p>
<p>The formulation of these wartime administrative guidelines decided by the Guangdong Provincial Affairs Council was based on very careful consideration. First, senior officials of the various departments of the provincial government, following the instructions of Chairman Li of the provincial government and the heads of the various departments, deliberated on the environment and financial resources of Guangdong and drafted the initial draft. Later, they frequently held meetings to discuss and formulate the draft, and then Chairman Li invited members of the Central Committee, Lu Yougang and Deng Qingyang, and other members who were inspecting the party and government in Guangdong Province to discuss and revise each item, and then submitted it to the 28th Provincial Affairs Council meeting in early May for approval and implementation. The items and measures listed in it can be regarded as the crystallization of the experiences and lessons of Guangdong Province's bloody tears in the 22 months of the War of Resistance, and are also urgently needed by the current wartime environment and tasks of Guangdong, and can be promoted by human and financial resources; therefore, it is not only different from any past administrative needs that were made behind closed doors or represented a certain one-sided need, but also different from political programs that rely entirely on theory and ideals. We would like to express our warm and high respect to the Chairman of Guangdong Province and the leaders on behalf of the people of Guangdong and the whole country for the emergence of this most perfect wartime administrative program! According to the Shaoguan newsletter, regarding this program, it has been divided by the competent authorities according to its nature, and specialized talents have been gathered to formulate implementation measures, preparing for universal and effective implementation, which makes us have unlimited hope for the political future of Guangdong and the future of the people's war against Japan, and increase unlimited confidence in victory! However, learning from past mistakes, we still have something to say, and dare to offer three humble suggestions for reference. That is, first, we hope that this relatively perfect administrative program will not repeat the mistakes of the past that could not be fulfilled, and will no longer be just on paper and cannot become a reality. To achieve this requirement, first, we sincerely hope that the Guangdong authorities will carefully supervise and urge all relevant authorities to implement it effectively, and second, we sincerely hope that the persons in charge of all relevant agencies can deeply recognize the important significance of faithfully implementing this program, do their best to overcome all obstacles, and carry out the struggle effectively and conscientiously to achieve its realization. What is even more important is to intensify the work of universal and in-depth publicity and explanation to the whole people, so that all the people of Guangdong Province can understand whether the implementation of this administrative program is related to the entire fate of Guangdong and the whole country, so that all the people of Guangdong Province can recognize that complying with government laws and assisting the government in implementing this program is everyone's main task at present. At the same time, we must firmly recognize that the promotion of this extensive and in-depth publicity work not only depends on the efforts of the responsible personnel of the relevant agencies, but also depends on the bold promotion of young cadres and talents from various parties who have a correct understanding of politics, a strong confidence in the War of Resistance, rich experience in mass work, and prestige among the people of Guangdong. Second, in order to realize this relatively perfect administrative program, there is also an important prerequisite, that is, we must universally and effectively promote the spirit of democracy advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen throughout his life, in order to promote the initiative and enthusiasm of the people of the whole province to support the implementation of this program. First of all, we hope that the Provincial Assembly will give it enthusiastic support and earnestly mobilize the people to support it; at the same time, we must also step up and effectively promote the establishment of the organization of the township assemblies in various cities and counties, to assist the government from the bottom up and earnestly promote it. Third, we believe that this administrative program is not only suitable for the urgent needs of Guangdong Province today, but also roughly suitable for the urgent needs of other provinces. We hope that all provinces will take the Guangdong Provincial Government as a model, strive to formulate and promote this kind of wartime administrative program first, effectively, and conscientiously, in order to jointly mobilize the strength of the whole nation, support the protracted War of Resistance, and lay the foundation for national construction. Finally, we must also recognize that the × people and traitors do not want our perfect implementation of this administrative program, and they will inevitably use all methods to hinder and sabotage it, especially using rumors, provocation, alienation, and other conspiracies. Therefore, we must fight against this conspiracy, and the main thing is to consolidate our anti-Japanese national united front and consolidate the close cooperation between all ethnic groups, all parties, all classes, all groups, institutions, and the people and the government!</p>
<h3 id="e4">Latinized New Writing is the Most Ideal Tool for Promoting Life Education Movement...After Reading Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Letter to Comrades of the Life Education Society" <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Dan</p>
<p>Second, how to enable compatriots across the country to have two common languages. Although there is now a "Mandarin" (Northern language), this language is only popular among a small number of intellectuals, and most compatriots use their own dialects; although the War of Resistance also gives various Chinese dialects the opportunity to meet and merge; if we can strengthen it and make it develop rapidly, we can promote the formation of a unified language of the Chinese nation; purify the local dialects, and make China's language and culture reach a higher level.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the solution to these two issues depends on the implementation of comprehensive education and life education. Mr. Tao said:</p>
<p>"To turn a ××××× feudal country into a complete one is something that few people can do successfully. We must educate the masses and rise up together to shoulder this great mission, but to enable the people to receive this education, there must be three conditions.</p>
<p>First, it must save money so that the poor can receive education.</p>
<p>Second, it must save time so that the busy can also seek knowledge.</p>
<p>Third, it must be popular so that the uneducated can also understand.</p>
<p>The theory and practice of Latinized New Literature can be said to have been produced for these three conditions. In other words, to become a modernized new writing and meet the needs of the masses, it must have similar three conditions:</p>
<p>First, it must be easy to learn and use. Because of the difficulty of our old Chinese characters, to memorize thousands of sound, meaning, and form blocks that are like kaleidoscope changes, it takes more than five years,</p>
<p>Second, it must be able to fully express the spoken language of the masses and write it out truthfully.</p>
<p>Third, it must be able to cooperate with modern technology and life, such as typing, printing, telegraphing, cataloging,  language, translating and accepting international progressive culture, etc.</p>
<p>Because: Latinized New Writing itself has these three conditions to meet the requirements of education is the masses.</p>
<p>To save money and time, and not waste money and energy, Latinized New Writing is the most ideal tool for promoting the life education movement. According to a small statistic in the opinion letter signed by more than 600 people, including Cai Yuanpei, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, and Liu Yazi, in 1936:</p>
<p>According to the results of the New Writing Program experiment in Shanghai dialect, ordinary people spend one hour a day, and only need half a month to write New Writing letters, read New Writing newspapers, and read New Writing books. People who are a little stupid only need one month (30 hours), and the results are also good for each person. Only three cents are needed. It costs nine cents a year to train a child for compulsory education. It costs one dollar and eighty cents to train an adult for mass education. It costs three cents to use a small teacher to teach Tanzi in the Shanghai area. Popularizing the most basic Chinese character education for 300 million people costs 90 million... If we promote New Writing, from the perspective of time and money, New Writing is the most economical writing tool for popularizing mass education."</p>
<p>Moreover, after the War of Resistance, the results of New Writing education supported by Mr. Chen Heqin, director of the Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau, have been very considerable.</p>
<p>Third, it must be popular so that the uneducated can also understand. In fact, to achieve "popularity," using Chinese characters is limited, except for using Latinized New Writing. Because many of the things that the common people say, most of them cannot be expressed and written in Chinese characters. On the contrary, if you want to use New Writing to write "zhi hu ye zhe" classical Chinese or "foreign stereotypes," or the so-called "quotation style," it is also impossible to understand. Only the spoken language of modern people can be expressed. In this way, "popularity" in New Writing is no longer a "requirement" or "slogan," but a "lifeline." "It must be so popular," otherwise, it will not be understood. Moreover, using New Writing can also unite and integrate Chinese language and writing. I remember that Mr. Hu Yuzhi advocated writing Chinese characters together, but as a result, Chinese characters cannot be written together. This is Mr. Hu's exposure to the unreasonableness of Chinese characters. For example, the War of Resistance, propaganda, and the Three People's Principles are all the same concept, but Chinese characters are divided into two or four blocks, or four or more blocks that cannot be connected, so writing words together is more convenient for the common people to use. Because they know that a hoe is not a hoe and a head.</p>
<p>Now, I should end this article. We know that Latinized writing is just a language tool, just a simple language tool, and of course it cannot include education or everything else, but we cannot deny that the quality of the tool is enough to determine the success or failure of something, just like the means of production in society can determine the relations of production and even the entire social system. At the same time, just as the proposal of "mobilizing national intellectuals to eliminate illiteracy and popularize mass knowledge to resist Japan and build the country" said, in fact, in literacy training, we can simultaneously import preliminary knowledge about resisting Japan and building the country. Then, I hope that every intellectual in the country will rise up to actively promote the Latinized New Writing movement!</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Battle in Southern Henan is Unprecedentedly Tense; Our Army Pursues and Attacks the Enemy to Prevent Them from Invading Southward; The Situation in Tongbai and Xinye Turns Stable <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] The bloody battle on the border between Henan and Hubei is in full swing. The enemy's main force is in northern Hubei, but the focus of the current contention is in southern Henan. The enemy's advance on Tongbai and Xinye is very urgent, with the aim of pressing the flank and rear of our large army in the Tongbai Mountains and cutting off our retreat route. However, our troops attacking in southern Henan have captured Tanghe and are pursuing the enemy, so the situation is more stable than before.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 14th] The county seat of Tanghe was violently attacked by a certain battalion of our certain unit and two local self-defense units. On the 13th, they stormed into the city. A regiment of a certain division also engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the eastern suburbs of the city, capturing two enemy officers on the spot and killing more than a hundred enemy soldiers. On the 14th, they entered the city to appease the people.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] According to news from the front line last night, a fierce battle broke out between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Hubei Province recently. As a result, the Chinese army recaptured Huamiaoqian south of Jingshan, but Zhongxiang lost several small peaks to the Japanese army. It is estimated that the number of casualties of the enemy army from the 2nd to the 10th reached as many as 12,800, it is said.</p>
<p>The Entire Shanxi Border is in a Stalemate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 14th] Military affairs on the Shanxi front have been in a stalemate for the past week. The strongholds on the east side of the Tongpu Railway in the triangular area are still under our army's encirclement and surveillance. The 1st Division of the enemy's main force in Shanxi Province has suffered heavy losses, with some regiments having only 700 or 800 men left. It is said that Division Commander Ushijima, after being reprimanded by Sugiyama for misdirecting command, will be transferred back to Tianjin to take on training work. Most of the key points outside Anze and Fushan are under our control. The enemy is only holding on to the city gate. Since the beginning of the month, the enemy in Hongdong has attacked the central area between Anfu and Anfu to the east, but after being attacked separately by our army, the enemy suffered losses and retreated to the northern section of the Jinbai Highway. The enemy also has no ability to invade southward, building bunkers and repairing roads to prevent our attacks. There have been occasional contacts on both the north and south banks of the Yellow River. The highways in Xinjian, Jishan, Hejin, Wanquan, Ronghe, and other places are constantly being destroyed by us. In the Xinjian area, the enemy has repeatedly tried to divide its troops and harass the villages and towns in the southern pass of the Lüliang Mountains, but has not succeeded. The important high ground of Shangzhen Xipokou, north of Hejin, which controls the Yumen Ferry, is currently under attack by our army. There are no major changes in Tumen Heilongguan in western Shanxi. In addition to continuing to besiege, our army also frequently attacks the enemy in transit. The area west of Fenhua River in Zhaocheng and Huoxian has become the focus of the war in western Shanxi. After the enemy increased by more than a thousand in Wan'an on the 8th, it is expected that there will be a larger battle in the area. On the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, after repeated large-scale destruction by us, the enemy's mobilization and transportation have become extremely difficult. Currently, the rails north and south of the city have been destroyed by us for a total of seventy or eighty miles. The bridges in Cuiqu, south of the city, and Xinzhilinfen to the south, and Zhaoqu Chaizhuang have all been bombed. In the Zhongyang Dashi Dawu area, the enemy reinforced about a thousand men from the rear, and there is a pattern of attacking Liucun in the west. The key points near Pianguan in northwestern Shanxi have been recovered by us one after another. The remaining enemies have retreated to the city and are holding on to the Wutai area. The enemy has transferred about 10,000 men from northern Taiyuan, stationed along the line from Dongye Town to Doucun in the city, and began to attack eastward on the 7th, invading Dongru Village to expand the walls. The enemy's machine gun company has also been unusually active in the area in recent days. According to last autumn, the enemy mobilized 50,000 troops and besieged Wutai in ten routes, but it was inevitable that they would be defeated miserably. This time they are disturbing again, and it will undoubtedly be crushed by us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 14th] The puppet imperial collaborationist army in southern Jin deeply understood the great righteousness, and many of them have revolted one after another. Most of their forces have been disintegrated, and the remnants can be cleared up in a short period of time. It was found that on the 7th of this month, Xu Huapeng's troops revolted in Qizhi Town, south of Linjin. Following Xu, Shang Wujie's troops revolted in the Meili Town east of Linying on the 11th, and Su Xianbang's troops revolted in Guifeng Mountain east of Wenxi on the 13th. The revolting troops are now being reorganized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 14th] The enemy in Tonghua Town, west of Wanquan, was severely attacked by us and most of them were annihilated. The remaining enemies fled east, and we immediately recaptured the town. The enemy in Ronghe has only a few left, and we are searching for them.</p>
<p>Our Army Advances into Southern Suiyuan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 13th] On the 11th, a certain unit of our army advanced northward from southern Suiyuan to Houjia Yaozi, north of Liangcheng, and encountered 500-600 enemies. Another unit encountered more than 300 enemies in Zaohu Yaozi. A fierce battle broke out at the same time. Our army attacked bravely and fiercely, and defeated the enemy. Following up, they have now crossed the  road line and advanced to the Yulin area on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 13th] Two detachments of our certain unit and a certain unit fought fiercely with the enemy in Liangcheng near Xincheng for more than two hours on the 10th. The enemy could not support it and fled eastward. Our army advanced to the Bainao Ridge area and completely destroyed the highway from   to Liangcheng and from Yaohuodi to Dongzishan, cutting off traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e6">General Deng Longguang's Interview Record <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Hetian</p>
<p>【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】The Xijiang Front, which had been quiet for several months, is now tense again. X bandits who sneaked across from Lijiang are fighting with us in the area of Shaping and Jiangmen. Jiangmen has been gained and lost no less than ten times. The joint sea, land, and air attacks by the X people, and the intensity of the fighting, are rare since the battle of Beiting. The gains in the past few days include killing two X battalion commanders, Zhi Song Zhimu, and countless X soldiers wounded or killed. In addition, more than two hundred X puppet soldiers were captured alive. This is indeed a serious blow to the X people's invasion and a victorious page in our South China Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>However, the creator of this victory is General Deng Longguang, who has repeatedly gone north to kill X. The prestige of killing X on the Nanxun Line has reappeared on the Xijiang Front. Everyone is naturally very happy to hear this news. The war zone inspection group of this war zone arrived at ×× amidst the roaring artillery fire on the front line. The reporter took the rare opportunity to visit General Deng Longguang, the military leader who defended Xijiang.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that General Deng is a veteran of the Guangdong Army (Fourth Army). He has a spirit of perseverance and struggle, and he has far-sighted courage and insight. Seeing his shrewd and decisive eyes and the demeanor of a general of Guangdong, I am reminded of the influence of the spirit of General Zhang Fakui, the creator of the Iron Army. They have the same style.</p>
<p>General Deng lives in a newly built thatched house, which is simply furnished. In addition to a few small benches and a long table in the living room, there is a map of several feet hanging on the wall. He was in the house with Director Lin (Director of the Inspection Group) looking at the map, discussing how our troops should be deployed, where the enemy would attack from, and how to annihilate the X people. They were talking with great interest, deeply feeling that victory was very certain. However, he was very careful about this issue and asked the Chief of Staff and Director Lin to study it carefully. The reporter took the opportunity to ask for advice, and General Deng spoke out his views very frankly, as if he were an old friend.</p>
<p>(1) His thoughts after returning to Guangdong: He said, "Since the completion of the unification movement, there has been no progress in Guangdong's military and political affairs. The only effect is that the power has been unified, but the substance of this power has not been strengthened as a result. Moreover, a part of the quantity has become huge, and the quality has become even more empty. The ability of various troops to kill X in the north was slightly established, purely due to the historical origins accumulated by the people of each unit. Therefore, the X people voluntarily landed on Dan Dengmu and Guangzhou fell in only a few days. This is not an unexpected event. After I broke through in Nanjing, I returned to southern Hunan to reorganize and assist the troops. Later, I was transferred back to Guangdong and relieved of my military post. The 156th Division, which I had personally organized and established for many years, was assigned to the 64th Army and went north again to participate in the outer defense of Wuhan. I myself left Guangdong two days before the fall of Guangzhou and traveled back and forth to Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi for more than a month. Then I returned to my hometown for a short rest. Later, I was ordered to take charge of the 64th Army. I recovered from my illness for more than a month and had not taken over the matter for a long time. I only arrived in Zhaoqing at the end of last month, and it has only been a month since then. Therefore, the so-called thoughts after returning to Guangdong are always gratitude. My consistent feeling is that unless the evil disease of selfishness is eliminated from everything in the military, political, and social spheres, there is no way to do anything. Now it is still "expediency" that dominates the whole situation. People in high positions will often fall into the trap of "it is difficult to be a good person." I personally abide by doing my best. All the departments I supervise also hang this as their goal and go together, without arguing about merits or demerits, sacrificing ourselves for the nation above all else and the country above all else amidst discrimination and in the midst of all kinds of difficulties and pains."</p>
<p>(2) His opinion on the second phase of the War of Resistance: He said, "The War of Resistance against Japan is a war at the final juncture of national survival, and it is also a competition of two national strengths. We should mobilize the strength of the entire nation to fight to defend our motherland. The key to victory in the second phase of the War of Resistance lies in mobilizing the masses. To mobilize the masses, politics must be clarified in order to realize what Sun Tzu said, 'Those who lead, make the people agree with the ruler, they can die with him, they can live with him, and they will not fear danger.' My opinion is to take political clarification and military discipline as the foundation of everything."</p>
<p>(3) The situation of mobilizing the people in Xijiang: "In fact, this issue is impossible to discuss. After the fall of Guangzhou, the Guangdong people's faith in the government has dropped to zero. Therefore, the consciousness of being a docile subject and raising the white flag has been shaking vigorously within the narrow vision of some ignorant people. After our army arrived, the discipline of the troops gave the people a slightly better impression. Although we cannot love the people like our children, we will never disturb the people. The perception has improved slightly. However, the bad habits that have grown for a long time are not easy to eliminate immediately. Therefore, it takes a lot of time and effort to win over the hearts of the people. The use of politics is now hampered by the unsound local government structure, and the people are still unable to be moved. The first step is to start clearing household registration and eliminating bandits to engage in organization. All of these tasks are done by officers and soldiers personally. During these inspection visits, the political work of the army divisions and regiments has included mass movements in the work agenda. Each regiment has a work team of more than thirty people, who are fully responsible for this work, passing from the officials to organization and training. For example, in Wenwei Township, they have closely organized the people. The same work is being done in the villages of each defense army. In particular, the Xijiang Anti-Japanese Youth League is flourishing and developing in various parts of Xijiang. These are undoubtedly initiated by the army, but Commander Deng is doing his best to guide and encourage their work, providing them with various conveniences in their work. This is a new phenomenon."</p>
<p>"Because there are no good regulations for military-civilian transportation in the war zone, and the cooperation between the party, government, and military is not close enough, there is no good coordination in mobilizing the masses. It is already the best phenomenon if you do it and he follows. It is still the case that you do it and he still stands by. Our army currently does not have a political department organization, and the main tools for mobilizing and organizing the masses are not united. Everything is difficult, and the time to realize and unleash the power of the masses to strike at the X people is still far away."</p>
<p>(4) What are the X people's intentions for South China? He said: "The purpose of the X people's invasion of China is naturally what is said in the memorial to the throne: 'To seize China as a base for dominating the world.' Now the X people's plan to rule China with Chinese people has failed, and the attempt to fight a quick battle has also fallen through. Since Guangzhou has been unexpectedly obtained, they naturally want to expand their achievements. Therefore, the X people's intentions for South China are, first, to cut off our supply routes from the outside, and second, to unite the strength of South China. Therefore, opening up the Yuehan Railway and attacking Guangxi are unforgettable dreams for the X people. This time, the X people's sneaking across from Jiuting was a trial of strength and to rob food, but once they crossed the river, they were surrounded by our army in Shaping and severely beaten. Therefore, the X people, ashamed and angry at the failure, have increased their troops once or twice from several hundred to three thousand, resulting in the battle for Jiangmen, which is still being fought. Regardless of whether the X people are probing or launching a general offensive, we swear to fulfill our military duty to defend our territory and sweep the X people out of our land, giving full play to our "Guangdong revolutionary spirit" and giving the X people a final blow."</p>
<p>As he said this, his eyes were filled with angry flames, and the heroic spirit of commanding the three armies on the battlefield was revealed on his face. Even timid and fearful people would be excited when they saw this heroic and resolute spirit of fighting on the battlefield. We talked for a whole hour. Fearing that I would delay his official business, I said goodbye and returned. The bright moon was shining on the earth, and sparse artillery fire came from the front line. I thought that my family was waiting for the news of victory tomorrow.</p>

<p>【Xiamen, 15th Telegram】According to Japanese sources, Uchida, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, has made five demands to Mahoshinn, the Chief Director of the Gulangyu Public Concession: (1) Fundamentally control the anti-Japanese elements in the concession; (2) The Chief Director, Chief Supervisor, and Chief Secretary of the Public Works Bureau should be immediately replaced by Japanese people, and the number of Japanese police officers should also be increased; (3) Residents of He Guanji should have the right to participate in the election of the Public Works Bureau; (4) The three vacant seats for Chinese representatives in the Public Works Bureau should be filled; (5) The Japanese Consul is willing to cooperate with the Public Works Bureau police to stop "terrorist incidents."</p>

<p>【Haitong News Agency, London, 15th Telegram】It was announced this afternoon that Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Tokyo, has received instructions to protest to the Japanese government against the landing of Japanese troops on Gulangyu in the Xiamen Public Concession. According to Tongjie here, it would be a very serious incident if the Japanese army interfered with the administration of the authorities in the concession.</p>

<p>【Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th Telegram】According to sources here, it is said that Japan has decided to reject the protests of Britain, the United States, and France against the bombing of Chongqing. The Japanese side's reasons are three: (1) Chongqing is not an undefended city; (2) The damage to foreign consulates was actually caused by Japanese aircraft counterattacking Chinese artillery fire; (3) Foreign authorities should request the Chinese side to move the artillery positions away from foreign property.</p>

<p>【Reuters, London, 15th Telegram】All newspapers here today gave prominent coverage to the atrocities of the Japanese army on Gulangyu, without comment. Officials and business circles have acknowledged the seriousness of this attitude, believing that if the Japanese pressure on Gulangyu is not resisted, foreign concessions elsewhere are also in danger of suffering the same fate. The authorities are still awaiting reports from the original consular and naval officers, but have stated that while the Japanese dispatch of troops is not a violation of the treaty, the Japanese attempt to interfere with the administration of Gulangyu should not be ignored. Reuters reporters heard that the cabinet is closely watching the situation in the Far East, and the Gulangyu issue may be discussed at Wednesday's cabinet meeting. Members of Parliament and the China Committee are now hoping to raise this issue in the House of Commons and demand that the British Navy land on Gulangyu as soon as possible to prevent the Japanese army from completely controlling the concession before it is too late. At the same time, they also request the US naval authorities to take the same steps.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>(1) The war of resistance in the front and production in the rear are equally important; ...In military affairs, we must reorganize the army and build the army; in production, we must create production and build production. ...The production conference is as important as the military conference.</p>
<p>(2) A modern country is an economically independent country, and it is also a country with armed production. ...Under the inhuman atrocities of the X, we must use spiritual mobilization to achieve total material mobilization, and we must forge spiritual weapons to enrich material weapons.</p>
<p>(3) Production is the central issue of national economy and people's livelihood. We must follow the Premier's industrial plan and promote the national economic construction movement to achieve the purpose of our party's revolution.</p>
<p>(4) A few suggestions for this conference: (1) Concentrate capital and expand production; (2) In military affairs, all production must be centered on national defense; (3) Develop inherent production and maintain the national economic objectives; (4) Study science and technology to improve production quality; (5) Practice frugality and accumulate national construction funds; (6) Labor-management cooperation to improve production discipline.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion ...Prosperity and strength are the goals of our material construction: diligence is the foundation of our spiritual motivation. Spiritual and material aspects complement each other, and then we can win the victory of the War of Resistance and succeed in national construction to fulfill the mission of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Full text [Chongqing, Central News Agency, 15th Telegram] The full text of Generalissimo Chiang's instructions at the National Production Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, Vice Chairman, distinguished guests, today, experts in agriculture, industry, mining, transportation, and economy from all over the country have gathered together to hold a production conference. I am very happy and hopeful to have this opportunity to meet with you. At present, there are two major tasks in the country:</p>
<p>First, the war of resistance in the front, and second, production in the rear. Today, production in the rear is the same sacred undertaking as the war of resistance of the soldiers in the front. Without the bloodshed of the soldiers in the front, the production in the rear cannot be protected; without the production in the rear, the war of resistance in the front cannot be supported. We are holding a production conference here, which is as important as a military conference.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, in addition to killing our compatriots, forcibly occupying our land, and burning our property, the X people have also blockaded our seaports, plundered our resources, and bombed our cities in an attempt to sabotage all our production undertakings. Under these difficult and distressed circumstances, our entrepreneurs have been able to do their best to support the government's war of resistance, work hard, and support the situation miserably. This is the glory of our entrepreneurs. Now that we are holding a meeting here, many of you have come from afar regardless of the hardships. This patriotic spirit and self-improvement are really commendable.</p>
<p>At the same time, you know that our materials are not as good as those of the X people. Our land is vast and rich in resources, so why are our materials not as good as those of the X people? Because our material resources, although unlimited, have not been created by human labor. To put it bluntly, it is because goods are abandoned on the ground, so our materials are not as good as theirs. It is because we have neglected production and have unplanned production in the past, so our materials are not as good as theirs. If we are not as good as them, we must fight desperately to catch up. In military affairs, we must reorganize the army and build the army to establish our modern national defense equipment; in production, we must also adjust production, create production, and build production to establish our modern national defense production. In this production conference, I hope that you will seriously discuss and study to review the past, encourage the future, and immediately implement the discussed methods to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance. This is the great significance and great responsibility of this conference.</p>
<p>I often say that economy, military affairs, and education are the sources of the three major vitality of the country and also the three major important political tasks of the country at present. The so-called modern country is an economically independent country and a country with modern armed production. Our difficulties are multifaceted, but the root cause is due to economic backwardness. You know that the wild military aggression of the X people against our country has the ultimate goal of economic aggression. Now the X people are desperately carrying out economic aggression in North China. Although the X people's poisonous schemes will never be realized, we must deeply recognize the ugly face of the X people who suck blood and eat meat. A national spirit that is subdued by others is the beginning of national subjugation, and economic bankruptcy is the end of national subjugation. Today, we must mobilize the spirit, and at the same time, we must use the mobilization of the spirit to achieve the total mobilization of materials. If we cannot develop production at the same time during the War of Resistance, we cannot support the long-term War of Resistance. Moreover, even if the War of Resistance is won, if the national economy is bankrupt, this country can still be subjugated at any time. These days, you have witnessed the inhuman indiscriminate bombing of the central area of Chongqing by the X people. This kind of bombing and arson that is extremely devoid of military value certainly shows the X people's despicable shamelessness, but we must also recognize that the X people are vainly trying to threaten our spirit and destroy our production by this means. We are naturally extremely grieved, but we should grit our teeth, step up our work, and overcome difficulties. In the blood and fire, we should forge our spiritual weapons and build our material weapons, not only to drive out the inhuman X people with a long-term bloody battle, but also to establish a prosperous and strong new China based on the Three Principles of the People through long-term and arduous management.</p>
<p>Speaking of prosperity and strength, they are the two fundamental policies of establishing a country in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. This is the oldest policy of establishing a country in China and the newest policy of establishing a country in the world. Unfortunately, many people still do not understand this point, but we must realize profoundly that only when the country is prosperous and strong can it survive. In today's world, to be prosperous and strong, we must have sufficient food and troops. Today, so-called sufficient food means developing production, and so-called sufficient troops means reorganizing the army and building the army. Only with sufficient food and troops can we wage a long-term war of resistance and build a prosperous and strong country based on the Three Principles of the People. We must develop production to improve the people's lives and make everyone well-fed and well-clothed. We must develop production to ensure the survival of the country. Modern warfare, whether in equipment or supplies, must rely on industry, so production is the central issue of national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Since our materials are not as good as those of others, we must make up for the lack of materials with spirit and catch up head-on, accelerate economic construction. Construction is the backing of the War of Resistance and also the purpose of the War of Resistance. The fundamental work of building a country based on the Three Principles of the People is production construction. As Sun Yat-sen said, "The most important thing in construction is people's livelihood," which is what he meant. The Premier's lifelong goal was to build a country that is prosperous and strong and where the people live in peace and happiness. This is also the goal of our party's revolution. Twenty years ago, the Premier put forward an industrial plan. This great plan is still the fundamental policy of our economic construction today. At that time, the Premier wanted to use international capital after the European War to develop Chinese industries. Although times have changed today, and large-scale international investment may not be easy for a while, we must continue to work hard, try our best to attract foreign investment, and at the same time, do our best to build on our own. The National Economic Construction Movement that I put forward is to promote the national concerted effort to use its own strength to develop production, develop resources, and enrich the strength of modern countries. I have been promoting it for many years, but I must tell everyone that the National Economic Construction Movement is still far from completion. This movement must continue, and today, during the War of Resistance, we must make even greater efforts to quickly complete this movement. Regarding the wartime National Economic Construction Movement today, I would like to put forward a few suggestions for your reference. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e15">English Translation: Opening Speech by President Kong at the National Production Conference <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(1) Selection of Types and Nature of Production: Generally speaking, most production industries are beneficial to the national economy. However, their effects differ in terms of urgency and priority. Therefore, the nature and types of production must be suited to the current urgent needs. Recently, prices have been rising repeatedly in various regions. The main reason for this is the imbalance between supply and demand. People feel the lack of essential goods, while luxury and consumer goods still flood the market. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon. In the future, not only should imports be tailored to meet the needs, but domestic production should also strive to reduce the manufacture of consumer and luxury goods, concentrating all capital and labor on the production of essential goods, export trade goods, and national defense industrial goods. Among essential goods, special attention should be paid to increasing food production and promoting the textile industry. Our country is known as an agricultural country, but food imports are very large. Now that the occupied areas are expanding daily and import routes are interrupted, it is necessary to vigorously increase production in the inland areas to meet the emergency. The textile industry has mostly been concentrated in coastal ports. Since the outbreak of the war, the clothing problems of the military and the people all depend on the establishment of the inland textile industry. Export trade production is also very important at present. The replenishment of all foreign exchange funds since the war, the replenishment of military equipment, and the purchase of various necessities all rely on the export of local products as compensation. The production of items such as tung oil, tea, and fur should be promoted. As for the construction of the national defense industry, it is not only related to the future of the war, but also to the overall plan of national construction. It should be planned in a holistic and deliberate manner, and actively implemented.</p>
<p>(2) Regional Distribution of Production Industries: During this war, the center of the national economy and production has shifted from the southeast to the northwest. Therefore, I believe that, firstly, the establishment of provinces in the northwest should be successful first in order to unleash economic power as the foundation for national revival and prosperity. Therefore, current economic construction should focus on the southwest and northwest provinces, considering the source of raw materials, the supply of labor, the supply and demand situation, etc., to determine which area is suitable for which industry and when is suitable for which production. A comprehensive plan should be made to achieve the best results. Secondly, the success of an industry depends not only on detailed plans but also on striving to promote its work. Now, in this time of urgent war, everything must be put into practice, from planning to implementation, with swift means to achieve the greatest effect. The purpose of this production conference is to produce results through meetings, not to hold meetings for the sake of talking.</p>
<p>Therefore, all matters discussed and decided at the meeting must be implemented immediately to respond to the situation. The following points should also be taken into account in promoting production work:</p>
<p>(1) Improvement of the Organization of Production Agencies: The organization should strive to be sound, and it is especially important for organizations to coordinate with each other. In the past, production agencies in various regions often lacked close ties and presented a skewed state. Several organizations often focused on only one type of industry, while some industries that should be promoted were not noticed or promoted. As a result, one aspect developed particularly well, while many industries could not be fully developed due to a lack of capital and labor. As for the internal affairs of various agencies, there were also cases of bloated organizations with complex departments. Not only was the operation not flexible, but the authority was also not clear, resulting in many personnel frictions. Such situations are probably more likely to occur in government-run enterprises. In the future, regardless of public or private enterprises, their organization should strive to be simple, reasonable, commercialized, and civilianized, and should not be tainted with the old bureaucratic habits. They should vow not to engage in empty talk but to be practical.</p>
<p>(2) Raising and Allocating Production Funds: Our country originally lacked production capital, and the situation is even more difficult during this war. The highest principle of national economic construction is self-reliance. Therefore, in addition to using foreign capital when necessary, we should strive to develop national capital on the one hand and collect scattered funds from the people on the other hand, accumulating small amounts into large amounts for use. We should pay close attention to the promotion of rural cooperation and the encouragement of people's savings. As for the allocation of production funds, whether it is reasonable or not is even more important. The purpose of promoting production is to increase supplies and strengthen the war effort. It is necessary to achieve maximum production with a minimum amount of investment in order to comply with economic principles. Therefore, all production agencies should thoroughly study and discuss the methods of allocating funds, whether they are appropriate, whether there is any waste, and whether more economic methods can be sought based on reports. The government advocates thrift, not only hoping to save on consumption but also striving for economic rationality in production. I hope everyone can pay close attention to this point.</p>
<p>(3) Improvement of Production Methods: Striving for scientific and modern production methods is an unchanging iron rule in the process of national construction. However, during wartime, various production facilities have either been destroyed or are difficult to access due to traffic difficulties, lack of power equipment, and difficulty in restoring them. It is not possible to achieve immediate results in a short period of time by purchasing and establishing new ones. Therefore, we have no choice but to improve existing production methods and production institutions, such as handicrafts, home industries, and rural side businesses, by referring to modern theories in order to increase their efficiency. We must ensure that theory and method are matched, that industry and environment are adapted to each other, and that the old and the new are coordinated and used together. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. Although some young men have been drafted into the army, there is still surplus labor among women, children, and the elderly. Moreover, the nature of women is most suitable for this type of work. If we can find ways to utilize this, engaging them in production will greatly benefit the strengthening of the war effort.</p>
<p>(4) Training in Production Cooperation: As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person." The development of all undertakings depends on the promotion of human resources. Therefore, training talents is the engine for promoting future production. We have spared no effort in promoting vocational education. However, recently, school education has placed too much emphasis on theory. The state spends huge sums of money to establish higher education, but the talents cultivated are mostly unable to engage in actual production. This is a waste. I believe that at present, there is a great need for high-level technical talents, but the number of people needed is limited and they are still being recruited. What is most lacking is skilled workers, because these talents are the backbone of production professions. The economic wealth of all industrially advanced countries is based on their large number of skilled workers. Before the European War, Germany's wealth was an important component of this. The accelerated recovery after the war was also the same. Without skilled workers, even with perfect equipment, it would be used improperly, resulting in waste and reduced efficiency. Therefore, in the future, we should establish vocational schools in various production departments. In addition to imparting theories, we must also give them opportunities for practical training to ensure that schools and industries are integrated and that theory and practice are interconnected. Young people will not have the fear of unemployment, and society will not feel the lack of talent. Construction and restoration will be successful.</p>
<p>What I have said above is just a brief overview. All of you are in charge of production agencies or are well-known domestic experts. You will certainly be able to draw on what you have learned and experienced in your daily research, outline the main points, and carefully study them to contribute to the country. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said that the victory of the war must be achieved by eliminating the four wastes: wasted people, wasted materials, wasted land, and wasted time. And in order to achieve the goal of eliminating these four wastes, we must start by developing the economy, increasing agricultural production, and actively supporting handicrafts. In this second stage of the war, while we focus on the war in the front, production and construction in the rear are also the most important tasks. The responsibilities you bear today are as great as those of the soldiers fighting on the front lines. You have not hesitated to come here to attend the meeting despite your hard work. Your enthusiasm and perseverance have been fully demonstrated. I believe that this meeting will achieve good results and make a significant contribution to the war and national construction.

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today sent a note from the Soviet government to the British Ambassador here in reply to the British proposals for forwarding to London. However, the nature of the reply has not yet been disclosed. Molotov met with the British Ambassador for half an hour today, and the talks were very harmonious.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] The government newspaper expressed its approval of the British-Turkish agreement, stating that the "British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is a step towards creating a peace front. This is also the only effective way to stop the spread of aggression. Turkey, because of its military importance, has long been the target of aggression. Turkey also deeply feels this danger, which led to the satisfactory result of the British-Turkish negotiations."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] "Weekly News" reported that the British government will invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov or Deputy Foreign Minister to London to discuss the conclusion of a British-Soviet agreement. As for whether this trip will take place during or after the Geneva Conference, it is not yet known.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 15th] Yesterday, the Times here commented that the sole purpose of the British-Turkish agreement is Britain's attempt to control the two straits of the Dardanelles and Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. The Citizen's Newspaper also stated that it is not known whether Turkey was lured by British loans, as was the case with the treaties signed by Poland and Romania with Britain, which contained commercial implications. The newspaper also stated that in the past, when countries prepared for war, they purchased arms with cash, but now they use maintaining peace and opposing aggression as a pretext to prepare for expanding their armies.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] The "New York Times" reported today that, according to sources in Washington, if a new crisis situation occurs in Europe, President Roosevelt (pictured) is prepared to issue another appeal for peace at an appropriate time.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Italian Prime Minister Speaks Again, Some Issues Must Be Resolved First in the Tense International Situation, France Pays Close Attention to Italian Slogans <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Trapani, 15th] Mussolini delivered a brief speech today at the opening of the new Fiat factory workshop, stating, "I clearly described the pressing international situation yesterday. I now wish to reaffirm in the clearest terms the Italian desire for peace. I have also said that some issues must be resolved first to prevent dangers from arising over a long period of time." The other parts of Mussolini's speech concerned Italy's national social issues.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th] According to the Rome People's Newspaper on Sunday, the tension in the European situation is not due to issues such as Danzig, Tunisia, Djibouti, or Suez. Each issue can be easily resolved, but if the democratic countries have fairness and sincerity, everything can be solved easily. It also stated that although the Treaty of Versailles has collapsed, the democratic countries still want to undermine the rights and interests of Germany and Italy by another method. The Axis countries have always been concerned with peace. The premiers' speeches in Turin, meanwhile, the Axis countries are waiting patiently to see whether London and Paris will choose peace or war. It also stated that the encirclement policy will only result in a major war. If the democratic countries abandon this policy, it is believed that the masses will resolve all outstanding issues peacefully based on fair principles.</p>
<p>Britain Says Italian Prime Minister Will Act as Mediator</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th] Political and diplomatic circles here are surprised by the Italian Prime Minister's statement in his speech that none of the current European issues need to be resolved by force. They also stated that the Italian Prime Minister is now prepared to act as a mediator. Moreover, Mussolini's first speech since the establishment of the German-Italian military agreement, with its moderate tone, is worth noting. However, political circles stated that this is sufficient to indicate his determination to assist Germany in the German-Polish issue. Furthermore, the newspapers here this morning, while expressing satisfaction with the Italian Prime Minister's speech, still harbor doubts. Most still question the Italian Prime Minister's assertion that the democratic countries are harming the two Axis countries with economic policies. The Daily Express stated that the entire speech was moderate in tone and encouraged efforts to maintain European peace. The Daily Mail stated that this was a contradictory statement by Mussolini and questioned whether the Italian Prime Minister's statement that there is no need to resolve current issues with war refers to the Danzig issue or the conflict between his own country and France.</p>
<p>France Acknowledges Success of British and French Diplomacy</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Political circles here believe that Mussolini's speech has not changed the situation but has indeed eased it and is welcome internationally. The general opinion here is gradually feeling that the facts of the British-Turkish declaration and other successes of British and French diplomacy have had a great impact on the Axis countries, causing them to reflect on their future policies.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] After listening to Mussolini's speech, the Italian masses shouted slogans such as "Take back Nice, Tunisia, Corsica." The press here is paying more attention to this news than to Mussolini's speech. France still considers Mussolini's speech to be moderate and pays particular attention to Mussolini's statement that the severity of the European issue has not reached the point where it needs to be resolved by force. As everyone is on vacation and the Foreign Minister has gone to England and not yet returned, the government has not yet issued any criticism.</p>
<p>German Political Circles Express Welcome</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Today, German political circles warmly welcomed Mussolini's speech in Turin, considering it a direct response to Chamberlain (especially regarding the Danzig issue). A political critic claimed that some issues need to be resolved and do not necessarily require resolution by the sword, but the democratic countries must first prove their repeated statements that any change to the so-called "status quo" can be resolved through negotiation. It is feared that the arrogance of some people who insist on preventing the people of Danzig from using their democratic rights and self-determination to achieve their wishes will cause disputes. What the Axis countries expect in the future is the fact that Britain loves peace, not its empty words, because empty words are not enough.</p>
<p>Polish Newspaper Criticizes Italian Prime Minister's Speech</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 15th] The Polish official newspaper "Zes," was the first Polish newspaper to criticize Mussolini's speech yesterday morning. It expressed dissatisfaction with the Italian Prime Minister's attacks on democratic countries and the Treaty of Versailles, but considered Mussolini's statement that European issues do not need to be resolved by force to be extremely important. Official and semi-official circles are carefully scrutinizing the speech, but state that this speech cannot give the situation a chance to be resolved.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Shanghai Concessions and the Kulangsu Issue <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>According to today's newspapers, the situation in the First Shanghai Concession is becoming increasingly serious. The Japanese Foreign Minister and the Shanghai Consul held an important meeting and are rumored to have finally decided to adopt firm measures (see the Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 15th). Second, the situation on Kulangsu is becoming increasingly terrifying. The Japanese side has even made five unreasonable demands, such as thoroughly suppressing anti-Japanese elements and having Japanese people serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, the Police Chief, and the Secretary-General (Xiamen News from the Japanese-British Allied News Agency of this port on the 15th).</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the landing of Japanese troops on Kulangsu is closely related to the seizure of the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions and can be said to be a probing operation for the armed occupation of the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions. Therefore, these two events can be said to be the same event. The main intentions of the Japanese side are roughly as follows: First, because the Tianjin, Shanghai, and other concessions, leaseholds, and international settlements are the last strongholds of the powers' interests in China and the national capital along the Chinese coast since the Sino-Japanese War, they have long been coveted by the Japanese, who are now urgently seeking to seize them in order to supplement the economic strength of their military aggression in China and at the same time打击to打击the forces supporting our long-term resistance war by international and national capital. Second, and more importantly, is to begin to exclude all the interests and labor of the European and American powers in China and the Far East and to achieve their so-called "New Order in East Asia." This move, especially when the European situation is serious, contains the indirect support of the aggressive actions of its allies, the German and Italian aggressors, in Europe. Therefore, this move is a further expression of the joint offensive by the fascist aggressors against the democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France. Third, and what our Chinese compatriots, especially those in South China, cannot afford to ignore, is that the Japanese threat to the Shanghai concessions is also an attempt to undermine the economic and political base of our military rear battles that are beginning to take place, and the Japanese landing on Kulangsu is also an attempt to facilitate the Southward advance policy that is being actively prepared, especially the Chaozhou-Shantou strategy that is being planned!</p>
<p>After we understand these conspiracies and intentions of the Japanese, on the one hand, we must step up international propaganda to explain the serious threat of this move by the Japanese to the European powers, especially the British, French, and American countries, and arouse the democratic and peaceful countries to step up the movement of the Soviet Union to aid China and sanction Japan, so as to protect their Far East interests and protect the world's safe order. On the other hand, we must step up the awakening of overseas Chinese to the attention of such conspiracies by the Japanese, step up the movement to return to the country to serve, especially to use all our strength to assist the central government ××××××××××××, and strengthen the defense forces of Chaozhou-Shantou, the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi border, and the South Road and West River!</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] According to the Madrid correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," tens of thousands of Spanish, German, and Italian troops are concentrated in and around Madrid, preparing to hold a "victory parade" on Friday (the 19th). This military parade will be the largest in Spanish history. According to general estimates, General Franco will inspect 160,000 troops, including about 10,000 Italian troops under the command of General Gambara and about 4,500 German troops under the command of Colonel Liszten. The German and Italian troops will withdraw from Spain a few days after the military review. According to current plans, the German troops will leave Vigo on the 22nd of this month, while the Italian troops will leave Cadiz and Alicante.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Burgos, 14th] The German volunteer pilots, namely the Condor Legion, will return home on the 22nd of this month from the port of Vigo. The National Army authorities have scheduled a grand farewell celebration for them.</p>

<p>— Lin Jia Lv</p>
<p>[Minge Society Jinxi Correspondence] In Dongguan, Suide, northern Shaanxi, in the afternoon, countless villagers carry grain, wool fabrics, straw paper, fox furs, etc., local products, from the surrounding villages, gathering on this street. When the year-round hard work is exchanged for a few sheets of flowered paper—banknotes—they always bring back some red and green foreign cloth, silk, socks, or some colorful buttons and pins...to give to their longing wives or daughters. Little by little, but every day and countless times, they bring them, while the bosses, sleeves folded, squatting in front of street stalls or leaning on counters, always supply them inexhaustibly. When it is Yihetou (sixty li east of Suicheng)'s market day every three days, this situation is even more lively. I went to inquire with those magician bosses, and they all pointed in unison, "The 'gate' is at Qikou." Arriving at Qikou in Hedong, wow, a long street of five li, one warm inn after another, people from all directions, coming and going in a continuous stream. When I accidentally ran into a lithography bureau, there were four-cornered notebooks with Saipi covers, a New Star brand mimeograph machine, costing more than fifty yuan. Genuine old-brand Horii stencils, six yuan a tube. There were also all kinds of vacuum tube fountain pens, pencils, ink, small knives, and dazzling (Eastern) foreign stationery. It was the first time I saw such a beautiful stationery store in the northwest from Xian to Han. Asking the shop assistant, he said calmly: "From Taiyuan!"</p>
<p>Arriving at Lin County in Hedong, whenever I went into a restaurant, as soon as I sat down at the table, the lively young waiter would come to me very seriously and ask: "What kind of money do you use?" I stared at him blankly, not understanding. He hurriedly explained apologetically and firmly. "We can't make change for ten-yuan notes. Last time, a few people ate more than three yuan, and we couldn't make change either, so we could only let them owe it..." A large lithographed notice was posted on the wall, hoping that the people would trust the new Shanxi provincial currency, but everyone, military, government, and civilians, felt that using banknotes was always nerve-wracking. Some said that there was a shortage of small denominations, and some said that Taiyuan was manipulating it.</p>
<p>Today, I found a guest who had just returned from Taiyuan, and he explained these mysterious puzzles to me. He is the manager of a large merchant in Lin County, ××, and often goes to Taiyuan to purchase goods. This kind of trade with the × area has been popular since April of the lunar calendar year before last and has continued uninterrupted until now, with an average of over a hundred people per month (some are villagers engaged in small trade). In the past, it was possible to transport goods from this side to be sold on the other side, and then buy goods from that side to bring back. The main goods exported from this side are hemp and hemp ropes, followed by salt, cotton, etc. (now cotton is cheaper over there than here). The goods coming in include white coarse cloth, white foreign cloth, twill, thread serge, tribute satin, kerosene, foreign paper, shoes, socks, soap, flashlights, batteries, Western medicine, and various daily necessities. Now we are forbidden to transport goods out, so we can only bring money to buy them. However, individuals in the × area issue a large number of counterfeit banknotes, and the new Shanxi provincial currency is prohibited, but a large amount of legal tender is absorbed. Old provincial currency is also allowed, but it is completely manipulated by them. Normally, legal tender with the Tianjin imprint is worth nine jiao seven fen per yuan, while other types are only worth seven or eight jiao. In the past, one yuan of old provincial currency could be exchanged for nine jiao of the bogus United Reserve Bank, but the latest announcement said that after February 20th, it would be reduced to 60% (one yuan would only be worth six jiao), and after March 10th, it would be completely prohibited. Therefore, it is now very difficult to use the new ten-yuan provincial currency in the market in northwestern Shanxi. And a ten-yuan legal tender can be exchanged for eleven yuan.</p>
<p>His most recent trip to Taiyuan was on the second day of the twelfth lunar month when he set off from Lin County with a companion, a county servant, and two head of livestock, passing through Fangshan County, Yanfan south of Jingle, and reaching Xiangyang. Xiangyang is thirty li north of Taiyuan City, and the heavy troops of the × people are stationed in Lanchun to its northwest. However, our troops often go to Xiangyang for inspections, and Japanese soldiers also bring propaganda teams to give lectures. He entered the north gate of Taiyuan on the seventh, taking only six days en route. The north gate and south gate of Taiyuan City are open for passage, while the east gate and west gate are closed. Two Japanese soldiers and two Chinese puppet police guard the city gate. The Japanese soldiers wear yellow woolen uniforms and carry rifles, while the puppet police wear grass-green uniforms, peaked caps, and badges that are five-pointed copper stars from the former Generalissimo era, and carry wooden sticks. When entering the city, one must salute the Japanese and be inspected by the puppet police under the direction of the Japanese. It's very casual. As long as you have a "good citizen certificate" hanging on your chest, you can enter and exit without hindrance. (He took out a "good citizen certificate" from his pocket and showed it to me. It was issued locally, a rectangular white cloth strip with the three characters "good citizen certificate" in the middle, the age written on the left, the place name on the right, and stamped with the seal of the Lin County Chamber of Commerce. To pass through our side, you need a passport, which is deposited in Xiangyang.) There are quite a few people entering and leaving the city gate. After entering the city, they stayed at a familiar firm and dared not stay in an inn, because there were frequent inspections. It's very dangerous. Although it is easy to enter the city, things can still go wrong. Not long ago, a shop assistant from a certain shop in Lin County went to Taiyuan to purchase goods. He carried a family letter for a certain soldier of the × army, and it was discovered before entering the city. He was taken to a small house next to the city gate for questioning. He explained that the letter was sent to his shop by a certain wounded soldier hospital in Suide, and then the shop asked him to carry it, and he knew nothing else. The puppet police reproached him for making trouble for himself, but at the same time, they intended to release him. However, the Japanese soldiers took him very seriously to the garrison headquarters. After sleeping for a few days in the cold, he found someone to prove that he was indeed a merchant from Lin County, so he was released without any difficulty. On the day he came out, the Japanese officer asked him very kindly: "Which unit is stationed in the Lin County area? How many people are there? Where is the 19th Army stationed? How do they treat the people?" He answered these questions vaguely. (Once, a plainclothes detective from the ×× army was discovered and arrested by the × people in Lishi City, but he was not harmed. Instead, he was propagandized with a set of ideas that 'China's resistance has no hope of victory.')</p>
<p>Transporting goods out of the city is the only difficult key. After we forbade the export of goods to ×, the × people also ordered a blockade of exports. Everyone leaving the city is only allowed to carry one bolt of cloth and only five jin of sugar... Other military supplies such as Western medicine, foreign wax, twill, kerosene, etc., are strictly prohibited from being transported out. But they still smuggle freely. There are two ways: one is to try to bribe Japanese cars, load them with goods, and rush out of the city gate. (There are now three motor vehicle companies in Taiyuan, one for × army use, one run by merchants, and one run by Chinese merchants. The motor vehicle road north of Xiangyang was only recently destroyed.) One car requires fifty yuan. This method is very dangerous. Last month, one car was accidentally checked. In addition to the car and the goods being confiscated, the manager was detained, kerosene was poured into his mouth and nose, and he suffered all kinds of abuse. In the end, he spent more than three thousand yuan to barely buy a remnant of his life. The customers all ran away. Another way is more reliable, which is to collude with the puppet public security bureau and use large rubber-wheeled carts with license plates. Load the goods, cover them with a layer of tarpaulin. When leaving the city, the puppet police glance at it and let it pass. Everything can be taken out, and the Japanese soldiers also pretend not to notice, probably also having a hand in it. Each license plate can carry about 1,400 jin, and it costs more than thirty yuan in bribes. He had to go through three times to get his goods out of the city this time. The second time he was almost detained, probably because he spent less money. These procedures are all handled by merchants in the city. Only when the goods arrive in Xiangyang does one know how much money is needed. This time, he spent twenty yuan on shipping for more than 700 jin. There were four large carts traveling out together, with a total of more than 14,000 yuan worth of goods, most of which were from Qikou and Sanjiao. Because he couldn't get the goods out of the city, he stayed for half a month. The market in Taiyuan is as prosperous as before the war. There are few students, but most merchants are doing business peacefully. They don't care much about the war, but in reality, there are great difficulties. First, there is absolutely no guarantee for business. He described a real example (this happened in a firm he knew in the city). The manager of that firm exchanged nine hundred yuan of "gold notes" from a bank one day. On the way back to the store, two Japanese soldiers followed him and asked him to exchange them. He did not agree. That evening, the two Japanese soldiers led several armed companions into his store, forced him to open the cash register, took the original nine hundred yuan that had not been touched, and forced him to hand over the rest of his savings, looting a total of more than two thousand yuan, and then left. As a result, the manager did not dare to speak out afterward and endured it in silence. Second, the × people completely control the financial situation by issuing a large number of empty counterfeit banknotes. Third, the production factories along the Tongpu Railway have been taken over by the Japanese, such as many textile factories in Yuci and the match and tobacco companies and arsenals in Taiyuan. They all ship goods under the original brand names, but in reality, the Japanese are making all the profits. Therefore, now, whether it is domestic or foreign goods, everything is Japanese goods. For example, Taiyuan matches are banned here due to the absurd propaganda of the × people (anti-communist and against ×), and replaced with Fenyang matches. In fact, Fenyang matches are also Japanese goods. The white coarse cloth, twill, thread serge, tribute satin, etc. that are sold the most here all come from Yuci. White coarse cloth is more than one yuan more expensive per bolt (twelve yuan) than before the war because the × people transport large quantities of cloth to Hongzhao to exchange for cotton. In short, Chinese merchants are eking out a living under the complete control of the × people. Various public buildings in Taiyuan have been occupied by the Japanese. The Railway Bank is a major base of the × people's secret service. The Japanese have opened many restaurants, tea houses, and kilns in Taiyuan City. Another type of business is buying wood, scrap copper, and scrap iron.</p>
<p>Talking about the business situation in the Lin County area, he feels that there have been no special difficulties since the war, and it seems to be more active than before. There is no export now. The sales of imported goods—general consumer goods are twice as large as necessities. In particular, the twill, foreign wax, and various daily necessities needed by the military and political circles account for the majority. These all rely on the supply from Taiyuan and have not yet been resolved. Their biggest problem at present is that the × area will prohibit the use of old provincial currency and legal tender. What he hopes most is "to be able to transport goods to the × area for sale."</p>
<p>He is from Fenyang. His family still lives in Nanguan, Fenyang. Sometimes he goes back to see them himself. Sometimes he asks someone to take some money to them. It seems that there is no need to rescue his family from the × area. He told me two recent stories that happened in Fenyang: First, in the past year (lunar calendar) this year, the × people recruited more than 600 Chinese strong men, who were trained in the city for six months. The main thing was to teach Japanese and not allow them to speak Chinese. On the day of completion, the Japanese took out many beautiful Japanese military yellow woolen uniforms and Chinese cloth military uniforms, and let everyone choose freely. As a result, two-thirds (more than 400 people) chose to wear yellow woolen uniforms, and the rest wore cloth military uniforms. That night, the first group was transported by train to an unknown location. The second group took on the duties of "maintaining local security" such as puppet police and rural cleaning teams. Second, once, the Japanese army in Fenyang drove a large number of Chinese strong men to "clean the countryside." In a certain place in the suburbs, they encountered the ××× brigade of the ×× army. The strong men shouted, "We are Chinese!" The comrades of the ×× army replied: "Chinese, turn your guns around!" As a result, more than 400 Japanese soldiers were completely "cleaned" up.</p>
<p>He has few opinions or feelings about the various situations in the × area and China's resistance. They usually don't think or discuss this much. He is very vague about the current war situation. Although he runs in and out of the × area, he is not very excited. I pointed to the map to show him the current Sino-Japanese military situation, and told him that the reason why China's initial resistance was bound to fail was not surprising, but the × people had certain fatal weaknesses, and they were increasing day by day. I said that in our rear in the southwest, the government is now working hard to develop new large industries and commerce, and training new troops that are more powerful than the × people. In the rear of the × people, we have countless regular troops, guerrilla troops, and the common people, entangled with the × people. This is not even considered a real attack on the × people. When the × people have even greater difficulties, our new strength has grown, and international friends can help us even more, that will be the day when we truly counterattack, and we will drive the × people out of China in one fell swoop. The time cannot be determined, it depends on the extent of everyone's efforts. But this period will definitely come sooner or later! He and the other shop assistants gathered around, listening very attentively, and agreeing as if waking up from a dream.</p>
<p>The reporter believes that to eliminate the economic manipulation of the × people, it is necessary to implement planned and strict blockades and restrictions in the political sphere. In the economic field, we must actively promote various handicrafts and necessary industries to achieve a state of self-sufficiency. The two aspects must be carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>At the same time, although the appeasement policy of the × people cannot ultimately conceal their violent nature, the current sweet and deceptive phenomenon has a considerable effect on those compatriots in the business community who only know how to value profit and the honest people, especially on the many weaknesses that exist in the semi-feudal Chinese society itself. We should strengthen the propaganda work among the compatriots in the × area, and we should talk to those who come and go to the × area in particular, on the one hand, to inquire about the various actual situations in the × area, and on the other hand, to increase their awareness. This can not only teach them not to make erroneous actions but also deeply influence others. (End)</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 14th] A Reuters reporter on the Queen of Australia reports: "Passengers woke up this morning and immediately felt renewed excitement. The weather is clear, but everything in sight is large ice floes. The ship is traveling very slowly, only four nautical miles per hour. The ice floes are crashing left and right, and the paint on the side of the ship is sometimes wiped off. Looking back, a black sea divides the white ice, and black snow petrels are seen floating on the ice floes, while the escorting destroyer is closely following behind. The captain has changed course to the south to avoid thicker ice blocks. Although dense fog is gradually descending at this time, the ship is still able to slowly advance. In the evening, the ship's speed is only five miles. Those familiar with the situation in Canada know that they must be extremely anxious about any changes in the itinerary, so they are very sympathetic to them. The most restful service was presided over by the first mate, and both second mates participated, singing hymns in unison. This simple gathering added a special feeling because the ship's whistle was heard frequently."</p>
<p>[Reuters Quebec, 14th] According to the opinions of the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for Welcoming the British King and Queen to Canada, it is expected that the British King and Queen will not be able to arrive here before Wednesday. The official has not yet issued a notice regarding the exact time of the Queen of Australia's arrival here. Mr. Coleman, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, stated that he had not received notification from Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King to change the King's tour itinerary again.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Trivial Matters Lead to Feud, Hong Kong Ap Lei Chau Yesterday Had a Bloody Brawl, More Than Forty Xiamen People Seek Revenge and Destroyed Ho Hing Shipyard <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>At around 2 pm yesterday, a bloody revenge brawl suddenly occurred at Ho Hing Shipyard in Haoking Street, Ap Lei Chau, resulting in one death and seven injuries. The incident involved Chan Choi, a woman in her forties from Ho Hing Shipyard. Due to poor income and expensive firewood in recent years, she often went out to pick up firewood branches and Miscanthus sinensis to supplement her family expenses during her free time. The day before yesterday (14th), Choi went to Tai Shu Wan</p>
<p>to pick up firewood branches. That area is a district where Xiamen people gather, many of whom are engaged in making rice noodles. On that day, several troublemakers, seeing Choi arriving, thought she intended to invade their sphere of influence, so they accused Chan Choi and punched her before letting her leave. Afterwards, Chan Choi returned to the shipyard, feeling aggrieved by being beaten and humiliated for no reason, so she complained to everyone in the shipyard. Those who heard this were greatly angered. Not long after, a Xiamen woman came from Tai Shu Wan to Ap Lei Chau to get rice water, and Chan Choi saw her and wrote that those Xiamen people should not unreasonably humiliate people. The woman who was written also returned to her room and cried about the situation. The Xiamen people there were also very angry. Thus, both parties had a deep hatred over some trivial matters,</p>
<p>causing a fatal and bloody tragedy. According to residents of Ap Lei Chau, the Xiamen people of Tai Shu Wan had come to Hong Kong to hire several instructors. At around 1 pm yesterday, they gathered more than forty people, divided them into four long dragon boats, and came from Tai Shu Wan. They arrived about an hour later, landed, and each held pointed wooden sticks and sharp blades. Shouting loudly, they rushed directly to Ho Hing Shipyard, went straight into the factory, smashed objects, and picked up stones at the same time, throwing them arbitrarily. A small wooden house next to the shipyard also suffered the same fate. At that time, it was still difficult to resolve the situation. The neighbors, fearing that the incident would escalate, blew whistles to call the police. The Aberdeen Police Station, hearing the news, immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western policemen to rush to the scene. At that time, two Xiamen people who participated in the brawl, fearing arrest by the police, jumped into the sea, intending to escape by swimming. One of them, dressed in a black shirt and black trousers, hit a reef in the sea with his head while jumping down, immediately dying. Seeing this, the police quickly rescued him and applied artificial respiration to try to save him, but due to the severity of his injuries and the excessive amount of water in his stomach, he</p>
<p>could not be resuscitated. Another person was arrested by the police. His head was also injured. In total, three people from Ho Hing Shipyard were injured in this incident, namely, Wong Kam Yau, a man over sixty years old, Chow Fo Tsai, over thirty years old, and Chan Choi, a woman. All three were injured in the head. On the Xiamen side, three people were also injured on the spot. The most unfortunate was Ching Do Fu Tin Choi, who stepped forward to mediate during the fierce fighting, but was hit in the abdomen with a wooden stick and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The final investigation revealed that the deceased was named Lau Chau (53 years old), who cultivated vegetable gardens in Sham Shui Po for a living and lived in a wooden house without a street number. As a result of this fight, police detectives arrested more than a dozen people. In addition to the death of Lau Chau, eight people were injured. They were all taken back to the police station for detention and investigation, and then sent to Mary Hospital for treatment. However, their injuries were very minor, so after the doctor treated them, they were handed over to the police for detention. At the same time, the police telegraphed a photographer to the scene to photograph the scene of the incident and the body of the deceased for preservation. In addition to charging the detainees, they telegraphed a hearse to the scene to transport the body to the morgue for autopsy. The deceased's fatal injuries were to the head and the inside of the body. The head was broken open and the brain matter was exposed, a very tragic death, it was said.</p>

<p>According to American shipping news, April 29th was the Japanese Emperor's birthday. Japanese people held a "Japan Day" at the Jinmen Expo, holding grand celebrations. The United Overseas Chinese Unified Charity Donation Association in the United States, in order to arouse Westerners' attention and break through Japanese false propaganda, specially obtained permission from the China Exhibition Company to hold a Refugee Relief Day at the China Exhibition site on the same day, named "A Bowl of Rice" campaign. It received enthusiastic support from various sectors and extensively publicized through newspapers and broadcasting stations. The effect was fully demonstrated. It is estimated that many Chinese and Westerners visited and donated to the "Chinese Rice Bowl." Our special correspondent, Ms. Zhang Kunyi, on that day, dressed in black, stood in front of the painting studio, using sales to aid refugees. The tourists were greatly moved and purchased over seven hundred rubbings. The People's Daily was sold by Zhang. Therefore, they requested Zhang to paint four paintings and write ten calligraphic works, worth five thousand US dollars, to be contributed to the motherland. Zhang has already agreed. Before this "A Bowl of Rice" campaign was held, Xiao Jishan, Deputy Minister of the Overseas Chinese Department of the Central Executive Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, happened to be in the United States. The San Francisco branch party members held a grand welcoming party. That evening, Ms. Zhang Kunyi generously displayed her adoptive father Mr. Gao Qifeng's works, and Ms. Zhang's recent masterpieces with anti-Japanese spirit, hanging on the four walls for public appreciation. For a time, the atmosphere of patriotism was extremely tense.</p>
<h3 id="e31">The Maiden Voyage of the "Flora Lammesch" Ship; New Aircraft for China National Aviation Corporation Arrives Yesterday <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The "Flora Lammesch," the newly fitted ship of the American President Lines, represented by the Jebsen &amp; Co. in Hong Kong, departed from New York on her maiden voyage to Hong Kong and arrived this morning, docking at the Holt's Wharf. Also arriving was a Douglas DC-3 aircraft ordered by the China National Aviation Corporation. After the crash of the Guilin aircraft, the China National Aviation Corporation deeply felt the shortage of aircraft. At the same time, due to the successive opening of the Chongqing-Hanoi and Chongqing-Burma routes, a special envoy was sent to New York to order two aircraft, each capable of carrying twenty passengers. After the aircraft arrives in Hong Kong, it will be assembled at Kai Tak Airport before it can be used. The other aircraft will arrive in Hong Kong in two months. Afterwards, these two aircraft will be deployed on the Chongqing-Burma and Chongqing-Vietnam routes respectively. Also, the "Guilin" aircraft that was shot down by enemy aircraft earlier is still being repaired and assembled at Kai Tak Airport. The "Flora Lammesch" has a deadweight of 6,598 tons and a speed of 17 nautical miles per hour. It uses oil instead of coal as fuel. The cargo holds and passenger cabins are very modern. The first-class cabins have double rooms for four people and are equipped with private bathrooms. The ship also has a tennis court and swimming pool. It is also reported that the ship will regularly travel between New York and the Far East, its route passing through the Panama Canal across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Patriotic Vendor Chen Xin: Long-Term Charity Sale <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>With the Anti-Japanese War authorities directing effectively, news of victories on various fronts is frequently reported. Various salvation and charitable organizations are becoming more excited and working harder. The enthusiasm for charity sales and donations on the island last year was remarkable, and it is believed that all sectors can still recall it. Vendor Chen Xin, since September 18th last year, has voluntarily donated 50 cents as capital for long-term charity sales. From then until May 13th of this year, during the eight months, he has worked hard without slacking off, and therefore has been able to earn hundreds of times the profit. Chen's sales methods are very clever. He sets aside 30 minutes of work every day from 12:30 to 1:00 PM. This time is the Tai Koo Shipyard workers' quitting time. He constantly hawks beef jerky to the workers, rain or shine. His patriotic spirit and arduous efforts are truly commendable. All his earnings from charity sales are donated to the Chinese Women's War Relief Association. As of yesterday (the 13th), the eighth installment of eight dollars was delivered, bringing the total to two hundred dollars. It is believed that future results will be even better. A record of the donations in each period is as follows: First period, October 14, 27th year, six dollars; Second period, October 28th, ten dollars; Third period, November 17th, eighteen dollars and thirty-three cents; Fourth period, January 6th, 28th year, forty-eight dollars and forty-five cents; Fifth period, February 11th, thirty dollars; Sixth period, March 24th, forty dollars; Seventh period, April 27th, twenty-six dollars and twenty cents; Eighth period, May 13th, eight dollars. In addition, public bonds were purchased for thirteen dollars and two cents, totaling two hundred dollars in charity sales profit.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Chinese Women's Association Donates Ambulance Yesterday; Wang Zhengting Receives on Behalf of the Red Cross <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association recently resolved to donate an ambulance to the Chinese Red Cross. It has now been prepared, and a donation ceremony was held at 3:30 PM yesterday in front of Queen's Building. Those attending the donation ceremony included Mrs. Lo Man Kam, Dr. Ho Ai Ling, and the association's chairwoman Mrs. Li Shu Pei, Cao Xiuqun, etc. Wang Zhengting, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Ruiheng, and Wu Changyao also personally attended the reception. The atmosphere was very lively. At 3:30 PM, Mrs. Lo Man Kam handed the donation certificate to Wang Zhengting, and gave a speech. After the speech, commemorative photos were taken and the ceremony was completed. Afterwards, the association set up tea and refreshments to entertain the guests. Cao Xiuqun, the chairwoman, gave a welcoming speech. After the speech, Dr. Wang Zhengting rose to give a speech, saying that he felt very honored and grateful to be able to attend this meeting. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, both men and women in our country have participated in the war effort. However, some elderly people, although eager to go to the front line, do not have the strength. We must know that there are many ways to help the country. The strong can go to the front line, while the old and weak can contribute manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the country in the rear. The association currently has seventeen or eighteen medical teams serving in the front, with a total of about a hundred people. However, the disaster areas are so vast that seventeen or eighteen teams are not enough. I hope that we can organize three or four hundred medical teams in the shortest possible time to rescue wounded soldiers on the front line. If soldiers on the front are injured in battle, then rescuing them will make their hearts even more courageous, which will greatly enhance the strength of the war effort. Victory in the war requires unity and organization. Although your association is donating one ambulance today, if each organization donates one, given the large number of organizations in Hong Kong, the number should reach over a hundred. Our association currently has one hundred and forty-two ambulances serving on the front lines, and we urgently hope to reach two to three hundred. If we can complete this task, foreign friends will see the strength and spirit of unity of our compatriots and will naturally increase their trust. The future of the war will be even more promising. After the speech, the tea party ended.</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Governor's Speech <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Governor praised the good achievements of the Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Brigade in the past year and especially commended the spirit of service of the ambulance brigade members. He said that the most commendable achievement of the St. John Ambulance Brigade in serving the community in the past year was its service to refugees in November last year. At that time, the Japanese army was active on the Sino-British border, and countless men, women, and children fled into the Hong Kong border, causing considerable disorder. The St. John Ambulance Brigade provided valuable assistance at that time, such as treating the sick, caring for refugees, and serving in the Shenzhen refugee camp. Even when the Shenzhen refugee camp was bombed by Japanese planes, the St. John Brigade members remained steadfast in their positions, assisting doctors in rescuing the wounded and sick. Their spirit is commendable. The brigade has also established a maternity clinic, benefiting pregnant women in the area. In addition to serving refugees, the St. John Ambulance Brigade also engages in social services in Hong Kong, such as vaccination, cholera prevention injections, and surveys of the homeless. Their work is commendable. The Governor believes that the St. John Ambulance Brigade needs to be expanded and said that the government has paid attention to this and will appoint a special person to be responsible for organizing a nursing team to cooperate with the Air Defense Controller so that in times of emergency, each district in Hong Kong will have its own rescue personnel, so as not to cause disorder. Finally, the Governor appealed to the community to provide financial assistance to the St. John Ambulance Brigade.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Chatting about Hong Kong and Kowloon Herbal Tea Shops <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>The Only Place for the Proletariat to Linger After Work</p>
<p>It is generally estimated that the proletariat in Hong Kong accounts for at least 80% of the total population of over 1.2 million. Because there are so many proletarians, merchants plan for their lives and have restaurants and teahouses specially designed for them. And that "herbal tea shop" which is different from ordinary teahouses was also born in such a social background to meet the needs of the small citizens.</p>
<p>If we pass by the front of a herbal tea shop, the first thing that catches your eye is a two-foot-high brass gourd placed on a wooden stand. A newcomer to Hong Kong may not know what is in the gourd, right? In fact, the gourd contains more than a dozen kinds of "fresh herbs." Like bitter herbs, devil's claws, or cogon grass, bamboo leaves, etc., boiled into tea. Because of their "cooling" medicinal properties, Cantonese people call them "herbal tea."</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, these herbal tea shops were all simple. In a narrow or half of a shop, a few wooden chairs and wooden stools were placed to do business. Some were so simple that they set up a stall on the side, with a few bowls and a few earthenware pots on top, without chairs. The customers stood in front of the stall, drank it haphazardly, dropped a copper plate, and left. Later, those bosses who were good at doing business, with unique ingenuity, expanded their business and rented a larger shop. A long dining table was placed in the center, and neat wooden stools were arranged on both sides. Beautiful paper lanterns were hung on top, and a gramophone was set up to play records. One or two female employees were hired to entertain customers. With a completely new look, they opened up in a decent manner. At the same time, because most herbal teas are bitter, the emerging herbal tea shops also sold some cheap candies. The combination of bitter and sweet really attracted the small citizens. The sky was clear and bright, and the seats were full. Customers were like clouds. Once this trend started, in less than half a year, jealous colleagues imitated each other and competed to decorate lavishly and hire young and beautiful waitresses to attract customers.</p>
<p>Since then, herbal tea shops have become the only place for small citizens to relax. During their leisure time after work, as long as they have a few dimes in their pockets, they can come here and linger for a whole evening. Here, they can enjoy both Chinese and Western popular songs and admire the charming "tea flowers." They sit on both sides of the long table, looking so carefree, sipping a mouthful of herbal tea and chewing on a piece of candy. When they feel like it, they tease the waitresses to make them laugh, or talk nonsense about national affairs. In this way, they can sit from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, until they have dissipated the fatigue of the day and satisfied their subconscious interests, before leisurely returning home.</p>
<p>Some have taken a different approach. They hire a storyteller to sit high in the middle of the hall, slowly smoking and talking about "Five Tigers Pacifying the South" or "Yue Fei Sweeping the North." Others hire a commoner to sing Yangzhou opera, which can also attract customers.</p>
<p>The location of herbal tea shops is naturally not on Queen's Road Central or in the luxury district, but in areas where the hard-working masses and lower-middle-class citizens gather. In Hong Kong, there are already more than a dozen along Hollywood Road, from the Yaumati Street to the Dajie. Wanchai's Cross Street and Spring Garden Lane are also places where they make money. In Kowloon, there are at least thirty or more along Shanghai Street and Temple Street.</p>
<p>The names of herbal tea shops are mostly "Master Xiqiao," "Master Luofu," or "Master Gengtian," etc. The meaning of such naming is to indicate that he is a genuine "countryman" and that the herbal teas made by the villagers who gather authentic herbs in the countryside are the best.</p>
<p>In addition to herbal tea, herbal tea shops also sell "turtle jelly," which is almost the case everywhere. "Turtle jelly" is made from golden coin turtles and Smilax glabra. It is said that it can not only clear toxins and remove dampness, but its greatest effect is to treat venereal diseases. Therefore, they do not have to worry about not having customers.</p>
<p>Some herbal tea shop owners are also doctors who know a few herbal remedies and treat rare and difficult diseases. They hang up signs with a few herbs and a "secret recipe," and also open a fresh herbal medicine shop, where they sell herbs and boil herbal tea.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate their small business, in fact, it is a very good business to run. In the summer, the top few shops can have a business of 180 dollars a day. Calculating at a profit of 70%, they can easily make a profit of fifty or sixty dollars a day. It is said that many have bought good land and built houses.</p>
<p>The reason why the herbal tea shop business is so prosperous, in addition to the above, is some irrational rumors. There is a lot of sulfur in Hong Kong's soil, and drinking Hong Kong's water can easily cause fever, so you must drink herbal tea several times a month. In this way, how can the herbal tea shop business not be prosperous?</p>

Compensation for [blank space] evacuation will be handled by the Women and Children Protection Association in conjunction with the police department.</p>
<p>Forcible Evacuation of Women and Children</p>
<p>The evacuation of women and children has shifted from persuasion to coercion. Starting today, all Shantou police officers will be mobilized to forcibly evacuate women and children from the city. The deadline for completing the evacuation of women and children remaining in the city is the 20th. The methods are as follows: (1) Regardless of gender, all individuals aged 60 or above and 15 or below, or regardless of gender or age, those without occupations or official duties, are designated as the standard for mandatory evacuation. (2) If elderly and weak individuals who meet the evacuation criteria are found not to have evacuated, they should be taken to the respective branch offices to inquire about the reasons and ordered to provide a written guarantee to evacuate within two days.

<p>The Hui-Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force was originally organized by patriotic elements in the maritime community. The organization, life, and combat achievements of this force have been reported in detail in this newspaper. Under the command of Wen Brigade of the 151st Division, the force drove out the [blank space] of the East River, recovered Danshui, Huizhou, and [blank space] achieved remarkable feats. When the Wen Brigade was transferred, Captain Zeng, with the encouragement and assistance of the maritime community and overseas Chinese, expanded and trained the troops. For months, they have been stationed in Pingshan, eliminating [blank space] bandits, defending the territory, and safeguarding the people, and their achievements have become increasingly outstanding, earning the trust of the masses in the East River and overseas. The matter was reported to Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang, the highest military commander of the Fourth War Zone, who recognized that local mass armed forces, with the promotion and assistance of overseas Chinese, are becoming increasingly strong, which is a positive phenomenon in the war of resistance. Based on Chairman Chiang's instructions at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance that "guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare, and the people are more important than soldiers," he attached great importance to the force. On the 29th of the previous month, he sent inspectors to Pingshan for review. The original name was changed to the newly organized brigade of the Third Guerrilla Column of the Fourth War Zone, and it was assigned to the command of Commander Luo Fengxiang. After receiving the order, Luo immediately submitted it to the superiors for approval and commissioned Captain Zeng to continue commanding the force. Captain Zeng then chose yesterday to hold an oath-taking ceremony in Pingshan. Commander Luo sent Counselor Fang to the scene to supervise the oath-taking. Hong Kong maritime overseas Chinese groups, the Nanhui Overseas Chinese Rescue Association, local merchants, the cultural sector, and local [blank space] mass organizations all sent representatives to participate in the celebration. There were approximately several thousand guests.

After the ceremony, anti-Japanese slogans were chanted, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. In the evening, a grand evening party was held, featuring various national defense dramas and songs to add to the celebration. This atmosphere of military-civilian cooperation is unprecedented in the East River, which is very beneficial to the anti-[blank space] spirit of the masses in various counties of the East River.</p>

<p>(Fast News from Wengyuan) The battle situation in the northern line is getting better and better. The troops of our 12th Army Group are advancing steadily, with Guangzhou as the goal. The troops under the Second Guerrilla Area are cooperating with the main force in combat, and have repeatedly made outstanding contributions. The Yu-Bei team, in particular, is able to penetrate deep into the enemy's key areas, implementing the strategy of making the enemy's rear the front line, launching surprise attacks, cutting off the enemy's transportation, and annihilating the enemy's bandits. On the 12th and 13th, our Yu-Bei plainclothes team even advanced to the Liuhua Bridge in the north of Guangzhou and captured [blank space], creating a glorious page in the history of guerrilla warfare in central Guangdong. It is investigated that the [blank space] army has suffered setbacks in the northern line, and the rear is often severely attacked by the guerrilla team, losing contact with the front line, and eventually becoming at a loss.

<p>(Shantou News) Shantou's 600,000 metric tons of tax-free rice have reached the full quota, but the severe rice shortage has not been slightly reduced. Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce sent telegrams to the layers of meaning, appealing to transfer the remaining 100,000 metric tons of the 700,000 metric tons that were previously reduced for tax-free import to enrich the people's food. The original telegram is as follows: Shaoguan separately presented it to Zhang, Commander-in-Chief of the 5th War Zone, Li, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Wu Junjian, Director of the Shantou Municipal Government of the 5th War Zone Wartime Grain Management Office. According to the submissions from the Shantou North and South Port Transportation and Sales Industry and the Grains Industry Association, Chaozhou and Shantou have always been short of food, and this year's rice shortage is especially [blank space] severe. Previously, the Ministry of Finance was requested to allocate 700,000 metric tons of tax-free imported foreign rice to the Chaozhou Customs, which was a small amount. Then, the Food [blank space] Management Office reduced it to 600,000 metric tons, which was even more insufficient. Now, more than 500,000 metric tons of foreign rice have been transported into Chaozhou and Shantou and sold to the mainland, and it will soon be sold out. At this critical time of the war of resistance, the local people's food must not be lacking. I respectfully request that the reduced 100,000 gongzu be transferred to the Chaozhou Customs for import to enrich the people's food and other situations. It has been verified [blank space] that it is true that it will take two months before the early rice harvest. The amount of rice stored is really difficult to use. I should report to the electric pole for identification and verification, and beg to allow the Chaozhou Customs to transport the 700,000 metric tons of import as originally scheduled to reassure the people.

<h3 id="e52">Satirizing Dictatorial Countries: A New Trend in Hollywood Cinema; Expanding from the Silver Screen to the Broadway Stage; RKO's Pioneering Work Already Released <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Hollywood's movie audiences will temporarily forget the youthful love stories on the screen, because a batch of new films from general film companies are focused on those who discriminate against those who are different, especially the encirclement of Hitler, which is particularly obvious. From Chaplin to Warner Bros., they will all put Hitler's madness on the screen and point out that he is despicable and ridiculous.</p>
<p>RKO's "They Made Me a Spy" has already been released in the United States as a pioneer, and the story of the film is about foreigners doing secret work in Washington, clearly targeting Germany.</p>
<p>Warner Bros.' "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" seems to be the most powerful blow in Hollywood's attack on privileged people, pointing out that Hitler sent people to the United States to spy on military secrets and organized the National Society [blank space] in major cities, and also pointed out that Hitler's henchmen were scattered on ships in various European countries and used German ships as communication. There is a "character" in this film who goes to Europe on a [blank space] German ship in New York, and as a result is detained in a Nazi concentration camp.</p>
<p>Van [blank space] S. Yang is a producer who [blank space] contributed to Christman Taylor's short story Address Unknown and is preparing to immediately [blank space] make a film. This novel was first published in magazines. After the single edition, it has sold a lot in the United States. The story depicts a German and a Jewish man who jointly run a business in art goods. The Jewish man is in charge of the branch in New York, while the German is in charge of the business in Berlin.</p>
<p>Chaplin's short beard in "The Dictator" undoubtedly symbolizes Hitler first.</p>
<p>In addition, there are more anti-Nazi films in the planning or production, and this atmosphere has expanded from the screen to the stage. The costume maker Wei [blank space] Michael is scheduled to stage the play "I Killed a Jew" in Vienna on Broadway this summer.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation in Europe has been very tense, which has resulted in the [blank space] production of Paramount's "Air Raid" film, which has had to be delayed.

<p>(Fast News from Shaoguan) In order to concentrate human and material resources to cooperate with military affairs, the Ministry of Military Affairs has separately telegraphed all provinces to promptly carry out the registration of wartime health personnel. This province has drafted seven provisional measures for registration through the Health Department, and has been approved for promulgation and instructed all counties and cities to follow the Health Department.

The provisional registration measures are recorded as follows: Article 1: This province is to adjust health personnel and meet the needs of wartime. For the sake of this, special health personnel registration is held, and this method is formulated for handling. Article 2: All those who have the qualifications of doctors, pharmacists, pharmaceutical students, dentists, dentists, nurses, and midwives are health personnel.

<p>— Pygmalion, an export from MGM Studios, original work by George Bernard Shaw, starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.</p>
<p>In certain aspects, Professor Henry Higgins didn't resemble a professor at all. In fact, he had a high and broad forehead, filled with intelligence. His thin face always showed a stern expression. This sternness, combined with the tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses he occasionally wore, made him look even more like a scholar. However, his eyes held a kind light, and when he smiled, the sternness vanished.</p>
<p>He was indeed a professor, a renowned professor of phonetics. His monumental work, "Higgins' International Alphabet," was known worldwide, making him an authority on standard English pronunciation. In his house on Wimpole Street, he had a comprehensive laboratory with various machines for recording and analyzing speech sounds. He had taught the accurate pronunciation to the wives and daughters of wealthy men.</p>
<p>He had an interesting hobby, also his second boast: he could tell where a person was born in England from their speech, with an error margin of no more than six miles. If it was a Londoner, he could pinpoint the exact street they were born on. Last night, while waiting for a taxi outside Covent Garden with Colonel Pickering, he inadvertently pointed out the street a young flower girl was born on.</p>
<p>The poor, dirty flower girl initially stared at him in surprise. After a while, she became embarrassedly angry.</p>
<p>Because he carelessly said to Colonel Pickering, "Oh, listen to that voice—thinking she'll suffer for life! Hmph, in three months I can teach her to speak like a member of polite society, pretending to be a duchess to meet government ambassadors!"</p>
<p>He said this without realizing the implication. Today, as he led his guest Pickering to view his sound laboratory, he may have completely forgotten about the events of yesterday. Both were focused on the complex and interesting experimental electrical equipment. The air was filled with a monotonous buzzing sound from the equipment.</p>
<p>"How is it? Are you tired of listening to these sounds?" Higgins finally asked.</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment. Pickering lit a cigarette and said, "I really can't distinguish any difference in those sounds."</p>
<p>"Oh my," Higgins exclaimed, both embarrassed and surprised. He smiled and pointed to a recording machine with a speaker for Pickering to see, then pointed to a small Buddha statue that appeared to be used for setting things up, saying:</p>
<p>"Secret speaking tube." Before he finished speaking, someone knocked on the door. He called out, "Who is it? Is it Mrs. Pearce?"</p>
<p>The housekeeper said, "Sir, there's a young woman outside who wants to see you, a very ordinary girl. I originally intended to refuse her, but because..." She sighed, "You sometimes receive strange guests."</p>
<p>Standing at the door was a girl, her slender figure dressed in an ill-fitting cheap black dress. The dress was too tight, which only highlighted her youth.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Charity Football Match This Saturday: Hong Kong Combined Team to Challenge South China Team, Famous Players Invited to Participate in Fundraising <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Special report from our newspaper) The South China Athletic Association football team is scheduled to depart at the end of this month for Singapore, Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and other locations, led by Mok Hing, to engage in friendly competition. The Hong Kong sports community, as well as the "Working Service Corps," believe that the South China team is gathering all its star players, making it extremely strong. Therefore, they have invited the team to play a charity match against a strong local Hong Kong team before its departure on the 20th of this month (Saturday) to raise funds. It is said that the South China team considers this a charity and cannot refuse. They have accepted the invitation and have consulted with the Football Association, which has agreed to select the Hong Kong Combined team to play against them in order to attract a large audience. It is also said that the South China team's trip will last about four months before returning to Hong Kong. Therefore, this charity match is a farewell contribution and is attracting a lot of attention. It is expected that star players like Li Wai Tong will be playing. Mr. Li is one of the members going for the tour.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Combined team selection has been decided by the Football Association. The South China Athletic Association has also invited players such as Tai Guk Shan Nu and players from the Navy to participate in the charity event. The team has been formed with the following complete lineup. The team has many inter-port representatives, coupled with experienced players. The frontline, except for the right winger, Ambassen, who is not a regular choice, the remaining four players are top-notch. In the midfield, Gu Ba's skills are no weaker than Dickson, with Hui Geng or Foo Sa as support. Hau Yung-sang and Shi Han will strengthen the defense, forming an unbreakable barrier. De Karchin is also a rare talented goalkeeper. The match with the South China team will surely be an exciting performance. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Combined Team</p>
<p>De Karchin (Navy), Shi Han (Middlesex), Hau Yung-sang (Kwong Wah), Hui Geng-cheng (Fang Society), Gu Ba (Navy), Fitzwater (Middlesex), Hau Tao (Eastern), Tai Guk Shan Nu (St. Joseph's), Morris (Navy), Drapani (Unknown team), Ambassen (Military Supplies).

<p>The public men's basketball games were held last night at the Youth Gym, with three Group B matches. In the first match, South China played against Chung Sing. After the initial exchanges, the two teams were evenly matched. Cheng Si-wing and Tang Yiu-ming of South China made several good plays. Lin Bo-shu, Chen Hai-fu, Tang Sik-hung, and Lau Bing-chan all made contributions. Yuan Bing-qiu of Chung Sing was able to break through and score, and Li Tak-ki, Li Lai-ming, Ho Kau-tim, and Li Shing-chi also supported the counterattacks. However, South China was more aggressive and eventually won 44-40. In the second match, Reporters played against Chun Fung. After the start, Chun Fung was aggressive. Chan Shu-fan, Yu Mau-wai, and But Wing-chiu scored with shots from both sides. Leung Chuk-cheung and Siu Tin-lim of Reporters counterattacked and scored, but at the end of the game, Reporters still lost 38-44. In the final match, International played against Tai Chung. International was stronger than Tai Chung. After the exchange, Chan Wing-fat of International was particularly active. Li Fook-ki, Cheung Kwong-chak, Li Pak-nin, and Yuen Sik-yan were able to provide support. Chan Pak-chung, Ho Kam-kwai, and Tung Ki-biu of Tai Chung also tried their best to strengthen the team and had some success. However, the International team attacked quickly as a whole and defeated Tai Chung 43-22.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were three interschool volleyball matches. In the Senior grade, Pui Ying played against St. Paul's. After the initial exchanges, Pui Ying's defense and attack were consistent. Chen Mok-kei, Kwan Chu-tung, Yu Ting-kwong, Lin Wing-lui, and Kung Chuk-wah were able to take advantage of openings. St. Paul's focused on defending the middle and back rows, but due to misunderstandings, they often gave Pui Ying opportunities to exploit. However, in the end, St. Paul's rallied and counterattacked fiercely. Pui Ying was threatened and surrounded. As their energy waned, they lost 2-3. The scores for each set were: 21-15 to Pui Ying in the first set, 21-12 to Pui Ying in the second set, 14-21 to St. Paul's in the third set, 21-23 to St. Paul's in the fourth set, and 19-21 to St. Paul's in the fifth set. In the Junior grade, King's College played against Wah Yan. King's College was stronger. The match turned into a one-sided affair. During the preliminary round, Wah Yan had already been completely defeated by King's College and lost 1-3. The scores for each set were: 17-21 to King's College in the first set, 21-9 to King's College in the second set, 21-2 to King's College in the third set, and 21-16 to King's College in the fourth set. In the Children's grade, Queen's College played against Im Lai. The match was quite intense, but Im Lai had a slight edge and won in three straight sets. The scores for each set were: 21-19 to Im Lai in the first set, 22-20 to Im Lai in the second set, and 21-19 to Im Lai in the third set.

<p>(Helsinki News) Finnish baseball (Posa Pallo) was invented by Mr. Pikkarainen. Its gameplay is similar to American baseball, but its rules are simpler. Currently, over 100,000 people in Finland enjoy this new game. It is said that the World Games Organizing Committee has included Finnish baseball as a demonstration event. Participants in the Finnish baseball demonstration game will be the top two teams from the Finnish league.</p>
<p>The long-distance cycling race for next year's World Games was originally set for 119 kilometers. After discussions between the International Cycling Union and the World Games Organizing Committee's cycling group, it has been decided to extend the race to 188 kilometers. The race route will still be on the roads near Helsinki. It is said that the route is a 94-kilometer loop, which needs to be completed twice to finish the entire race.</p>
<p>The nurses' school, which will serve as a dormitory for female athletes, has been under construction for some time, and the entire project is expected to be completed by April 1st next year. It has eight stories and is equipped with modern facilities, accommodating 550 female athletes and staff. During the games, a post office and telephone exchange will be set up in the dormitory to facilitate communication for athletes from various countries.</p>
<p>[Helsinki, Finland, New Fortune News] It is estimated that at least 300,000 spectators will attend the 1940 World Games. Therefore, the Finnish World Games Organizing Committee has expanded the grandstands around the venue. Temporary sales outlets have been set up under the grandstands. Currently, primary and secondary schools in Helsinki are actively training for the mass games, with an expected 10,000 students participating in the grand event.</p>

<p>— Chen Suixian</p>
<p>Many sports enthusiasts still hesitate and waver. On one hand, they admire the sports of Germany and Italy. On the other hand, they praise the sports of the Soviet Union. This contradictory phenomenon stems from a lack of understanding of the essence of sports, assuming that the sports of Germany and Italy are the same as the sports of the Soviet Union. This is because past sports were not closely linked to social sciences. The sports propaganda of Germany and Italy is "sports for national defense," and the sports propaganda of the Soviet Union is also "sports for national defense." Everyone knows that a country with aggression comes before a country with national defense. In reality, who is for sports for national defense speaks louder than words. Were Abyssinia and Albania not destroyed by the fascist aggressors of Italy? Were Austria and Czechoslovakia not destroyed by the fascist aggressors of Germany? Therefore, sports and politics have a cause-and-effect relationship. We cannot yet tell who is right here. If we proceed blindly, we risk becoming lackeys of fascism. This is because the sports promoted by fascism are used to destroy human peace, focusing on military sports to strengthen aggression, and training aristocratic sports athletes to compete for national championships. The recent centralized training of Italian tennis players is an example. If these athletes can dominate the world in the future, they can become international professional tennis players and bring glory to the country. This is the purpose of fascist sports training. In contrast, the sports of the Soviet Union are popular among all people. Whether in cities or rural areas, everyone has the same opportunity to enjoy training. The nationwide broadcast of morning exercises is a good example. The Soviet Union has never been seen to concentrate on training athletes to participate in any international championships. To those championship enthusiasts who do not understand the essence of sports, this is truly inexplicable.</p>
<p>Anyone who thoroughly understands the truth of sports knows that sports training is the starting point of all life, the starting point of all society, and the starting point of humanity's conquest of nature. ×××××××××××××××××××××× The income from a single tennis or boxing championship match reaches hundreds of thousands of dollars. Any athlete who can participate in the competition becomes a member of the property-owning class! Can such sports be considered the starting point of life? Can they be considered a productive element of society? ××××××××××××××××××××××××</p>
<p>We must know that China is an agricultural country, a society of farmers. ×××××××××××××××××× It is also a country where education is not widespread. Any aristocratic championship-oriented sports are absolutely unsuitable. Not only are they unacceptable in the objective environment, but they also deepen contradictions. ××××××××××××××××× However, I believe that many of my readers share the same sentiments. Let us, through the light of reality, rush to the verdant fields of friendship. No spiritual force in the world can be isolated from reality. "Friendship" is no exception. However, our current friendship is different from the kind of friendship that was promoted during the "May Fourth" Movement, because the social environment we are in is completely different from the past. Precisely because of this difference, we must encourage each other to grasp the truth of realistic sports and strive together. We must also quickly seize sports to cooperate with this great national liberation war, and at the same time, broadcast the truth of sports to the whole country.</p>
<p>At this difficult time when our nation is on the brink of extinction, we must, regardless of class or faction, forge a united front of ironclad friendship under common interests and common goals. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e61">New Teas From Various Regions Are On the Market, Concentrated in Hong Kong for Export, Implementing Inspection Standards and Penalties to Improve Quality and Enhance Reputation <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>After the Trade Commission took over the management of national tea sales, it promulgated inspection standards and penalties for the collection and inspection of export tea by the responsible authorities in order to improve quality, enhance reputation, and expand the market. New teas from various regions are now on the market. Inland teas are allowed to be transported internally after the foreign exchange is settled in accordance with the law. Export teas are concentrated in Hong Kong for export. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Teas On the Market, Implementation of Management</p>
<p>Pihong from Anhui, Ninghong from Jiangxi, Wenzhouhong from Zhejiang, Huhong from Hunan and Hubei, Jianhong from Fujian, as well as Pingshui green tea from Shaoxing, Anhui, Luzhuang green tea, Wulong and Longjing tea from Huzhou and Hangzhou have successively been put on the market. Tea farmers are picking and manufacturing them in groups. However, since the Trade Commission and other agencies have taken over the management of national tea, these agencies will continue to implement management this year. (1) Export tea is required to be concentrated for export in Hong Kong and is strictly prohibited from being transported to Shanghai. (2) Inland tea is allowed to be transported freely, but foreign exchange must be settled in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Improving Quality, Enhancing Reputation</p>
<p>The Tea Inspection Office issued a notice regarding the new tea on the market, stating that tea inspection is originally intended to improve quality, enhance reputation, and expand the market. Tea merchants understand this well and process and manufacture tea meticulously. Many teas meet the inspection standards. However, there are also many who seek immediate private gain and produce substandard products. Such tea merchants are clearly destroying regulations and hindering the sales of Chinese tea as a whole, which will have a significant impact on the future of Chinese tea if not strictly prohibited. Therefore, this is a serious warning. Those who do not comply will be punished according to the law without leniency. All tea merchants must comply without fail. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>Penalties for Violating Inspection</p>
<p>Penalties for violating tea inspection standards: (1) Inland tea is absolutely not allowed to be colored. If export tea uses colorants, light and non-toxic colorants should be used. Those that are heavily colored or contain toxic substances will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (2) Tea that is insufficiently roasted or becomes damp during transportation, has been stored for too long and become moldy, has no aroma, or is cloudy and detrimental to health will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (3) Tea that contains fake leaves or other impurities that are detrimental to health will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (4) Tea that is over-roasted and has a strong burnt taste will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (5) Tea with excessive moisture, exceeding the specified limit, will be ordered to be re-processed. (6) Tea with excessive powder (excluding tea dust), exceeding the specified limit, will be ordered to be re-processed. (7) Tea with excessive stems (excluding tea stems), exceeding the specified limit, will be ordered to be re-sorted. (8) Packaging that does not meet the regulations will be ordered to be re-made.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Massive Import of Japanese Flour Affects Shanghai Flour Industry, Monopolizes Wheat in Occupied Areas, Shanghai Flour Mills Forced to Order Foreign Wheat <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News) Shanghai has always been the center of the flour industry in the country. After the war, the massive import and dumping of Japanese flour led to the loss of the flour market in North China. At the same time, the monopoly of wheat in the occupied areas forced Shanghai flour mills to order foreign wheat to be transported to Shanghai for supply. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai is the Center of the Flour Industry</p>
<p>Flour is one of the main food crops in our country, especially for the people in the north, so the demand is very high. There are a total of 93 mechanized flour mills in the country, spread across various provinces and cities. However, the largest supplier is still Shanghai. Of the national mechanized flour exports through trading ports, those exported from Shanghai account for 96%. Therefore, Shanghai is not only the center of the flour industry in the Yangtze River basin, but also the source of supply for flour nationwide. There are a total of 15 flour mills in Shanghai. The annual flour production is 10 million quintals, accounting for more than half of the national production. After the war, factories in the occupied areas were forced to shut down. Those that managed to continue operating were Fuxing, Beixin, and a few others. The flour production was greatly reduced compared to before the war.</p>
<p>Japanese Flour Import Monopolizes North China</p>
<p>After the war, foreign flour took the opportunity to import and dump. In 1938, 2,547,783 quintals were imported, valued at 52,985,269 yuan. In the first quarter of this year, 413,543 quintals were imported, valued at 7,820,964 yuan. Japan accounted for the most, followed by the United States, Australia, and Canada. North China, such as Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Qingdao, was originally a sales area for Shanghai flour. After the war, the import and dumping of Japanese flour affected the area, and North China was occupied by the Japanese flour market. As a result, the northern sales of Shanghai flour decreased, and the North China market was flooded with Japanese flour, such as Green Real Ship and Green Bamboo brands.</p>
<p>Shanghai Factories Forced to Order Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Shanghai flour mills used to rely on Hebei, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and the surrounding areas of Shanghai for their raw material wheat. Today, affected by the Japanese monopoly, they have no choice but to order foreign wheat to be transported to Shanghai for supply. Imports have been made in installments since January of this year. According to customs reports, imports in the first quarter of this year were 1,014,650 quintals, valued at 8,120,464 yuan, all from the United States and Australia. As for the import of wheat in 1938, it only totaled 27 quintals, valued at 611 yuan. The sharp increase this year is due to the Japanese monopoly of wheat in the producing areas. Shanghai flour mills have been actively purchasing foreign wheat.</p>

<h3 id="e65">A Literary Controversy: Basketball Community Requests League to Sanction Lo Chun-hsuen; Evening Championship Game May Not Be Held <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In this year's Open Men's Basketball Tournament, during last week's match between Sing Tao and South China, Sing Tao won 31-29. However, South China appealed, claiming that Sing Tao's two points were due to a premature whistle blow. The Basketball League Council decided and both sides agreed to replay the game tonight at 8:30 PM, with the original staff officiating the game to determine the championship winner. This was the proposal decided on the evening of the 12th. However, after Lo Chun-hsuen's "strange article" was published on the 13th, questions arose regarding Lo Chun-hsuen's amateur status, raising doubts about whether he would participate in tonight's game. Strictly speaking, in addition to Lo Chun-hsuen's article being untruthful, the entire Sing Tao team is suspected of "making false reports," which could result in the loss of their amateur status. (Article 19 of the Amateur Sports Regulations clearly stipulates that "Athletes who make false reports regarding their qualifications, abilities, and achievements will lose their amateur status." The first paragraph of Lo Chun-hsuen's article states that "The championship naturally belongs to our Sing Tao team." In fact, the championship is pending determination tonight.) Therefore, whether tonight's game can proceed as scheduled depends on the League's actions.</p>
<p>Although the basketball community presented a letter to the League yesterday, the first point stated that Lo Chun-hsuen is a member of the Sing Tao team (but not the captain or any official). Although the article contains the phrase "we," it should not be regarded as representing the opinions of the entire Sing Tao team. In this regard, the basketball community only requests the League to sanction Mr. Lo personally and not the entire Sing Tao team. However, until the other team members of the team declare that they are not responsible for this article, they also have joint liability. Therefore, the League should act impartially and not only focus on Mr. Lo personally but also discuss the entire Sing Tao team. The basketball community's request is the public's will, and the League's execution is the law. Since there are existing laws, the scope of people and events, this situation may be excusable, but the precedent should not be abandoned. Enclosed is the basketball community's letter to the League:</p>
<p>Basketball Community's Request to the League to Sanction Lo Chun-hsuen</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>On the 13th of this month, the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily published an article written by Lo Chun-hsuen titled "Thoughts on This Year's Basketball League," which contains many sentences that insult the entire Hong Kong basketball community and contradict the identity of an amateur athlete. Our teams are shocked and, for the sake of rectifying the discipline, hereby submit a letter requesting a committee to resolve this matter. Our opinions are stated as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Lo Chun-hsuen is a member of the Sing Tao team (but not the captain or any official). Although the article contains the phrase "we," it should not be regarded as representing the opinions of the entire Sing Tao team. Therefore, our request for sanctions is directed at Lo Chun-hsuen personally and not the Sing Tao team as a whole. We request that the League consider this.</p>
<p>2.  The article written by Lo Chun-hsuen contains the following: "This year's basketball league has come to an end. Although the championship belongs to our Sing Tao team, we don't feel much interest because for the past five years, our group has occupied the top spot in the Hong Kong basketball scene."</p>
<p>As of today, this year's league has not yet concluded, and the championship is still in question. However, Lo Chun-hsuen claims that it already belongs to "us" and says that he "doesn't feel interested." His contempt for the entire Hong Kong basketball community is evident in his words. The last paragraph of the article states, "As for the International (the character 'international' ['際'] should be a mistake for 'local' ['貨'], but the original is 'international') Cup, we have decided not to participate in the competition, so let's give this trophy to others for some comfort." It is as if no team besides those that he added to the teams are participating in the competition could win the championship. Moreover, the implication is that those who are comforted are so because of the trophy, which he already regards as worthless. These words are inconsistent with his actions (the joy and jumping at the sound of the final whistle in the games against Eastern and South China are still fresh in everyone's minds) and show contempt for any basketball team in Hong Kong. The purpose of sports is to strengthen the body, and the goal of competitions is to increase competitive interest. If it were as Mr. Lo says, then the other teams in the basketball community would only participate in the cup competition with the championship as the goal, and without the championship, they would not be "comforted." The Sing Tao team members are the only ones who are "moved by the enthusiasm of Mr. Hu Hao, the manager of the Sing Tao Daily." Furthermore, there are also the following: "We don't find the term 'champion' strange at all," and "Therefore, this year's league, we originally wanted to hand over this four-year-old child to others to manage, just like sending him to kindergarten." Treating the championship term as not "strange" and regarding other teams as "childish" are self-aggrandizing, boastful, and disparaging to any team in Hong Kong. These are "arrogant words" never seen in the basketball community and shameless words. Therefore, Lo Chun-hsuen's deliberate insult to the entire Hong Kong basketball community should be sanctioned by your committee.</p>
<p>3.  According to Article 21 of the Amateur Sports Regulations promulgated by the China National Sports Association in 1931, "Amateur athletes may not concurrently serve as reporters for newspapers and receive money from them in the sports competitions they participate in (or in a part of the competition)." The Sing Tao Daily on the 13th clearly stated, "Special Writer of this Newspaper—Lo Chun-hsuen." According to journalistic practice, special writers must receive monetary compensation. Lo Chun-hsuen, as a special writer for the Sing Tao Daily, must be receiving salary or compensation and also serves as a reporter for the newspaper in the public basketball game he participated in (i.e., writing this article). Furthermore, Article 19 of the Amateur Regulations stipulates that "Athletes who make false reports regarding their qualifications, abilities, and achievements will lose their amateur status." Lo Chun-hsuen, claiming to have won the championship before the championship is resolved, is in clear contradiction with the Amateur Regulations. Your committee should immediately revoke his amateur status to prevent others from following suit and rectify the discipline. We request that the League consider this.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we hereby submit this letter requesting that your committee sanction Lo Chun-hsuen, revoke his amateur status, and we ask for your consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by the Hong Kong Basketball League, South China Athletic Association, Eastern Athletic Association, Chung Sing, Pui Ying, Sing Tao, and Hong Yuen.</p>

<h3 id="e66">On Death <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Zeff</p>
<p>Death, originally, can be divided into heavier than Mount Tai and lighter than a feather. What is meant by heavier than Mount Tai is nothing more than "sacrificing one's life for righteousness, giving up life for justice." Only by being able to die in this way can one's name be recorded in the history books, shine with the sun and moon, and coexist with heaven and earth. Although dead, it is like living, hence the saying "heavier than Mount Tai."</p>
<p>But achieving benevolence and taking righteousness also seem to have a process. That is to say: one should sacrifice one's life when it should be sacrificed, then it can be called achieving benevolence; one should give up one's life when it should be given up, then it can be called taking righteousness. If one rashly sacrifices one's life, it may not be possible to achieve the goal of achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. There are two stories in Mencius that illustrate this point, I will first quote them below:</p>
<p>"When Zengzi was living in Wucheng, there was a raid by the Yue bandits. Someone said, 'The bandits are coming, why not leave?' Zengzi said, 'Do not house people in my house, or damage their firewood.' When the bandits retreated, Zengzi said, 'Repair my walls and houses, and I will return.' When the bandits retreated, Zengzi returned. The people around him said, 'We treat you, sir, with such loyalty and respect. When the bandits came, you were the first to leave, to be a role model for the people. When the bandits retreated, you returned, which is almost impossible.' Zengzi still did it and said, 'This is not what you know. In the past, Shen Yu once said of the disaster of Fu Chu, "Those who followed the teacher were seventy people, and none of them were involved."'"</p>
<p>"When Zisi was living in Wei, there was a raid by the Qi bandits. Someone said, 'The bandits are coming. Why not all leave?' Zisi said, 'If I, Ji, leave, who will guard the ruler?'"</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Zengzi and Zisi follow the same path. Zengzi is a teacher, a father, and a brother; Zisi is a minister, and is humble. Zengzi and Zisi, if they were in each other's place, would all be the same." This is to say that being a teacher and being a minister are different. So when the bandits come, one can leave, but the other cannot leave, because Zengzi is only a teacher, without any weapons. Even if he sacrifices his life, it cannot be called achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. Zisi, as a minister, should forget himself for the sake of the country. Even if it comes to sacrificing one's life, he can still achieve benevolence and take righteousness. Therefore, Mencius criticized them, believing that Zengzi and Zisi's paths were actually the same, and if the environment changed, both of them could do the same.</p>
<p>Someone might say: In this case, only ministers sacrificing their lives can achieve benevolence and take righteousness; commoners, even if they sacrifice their lives, are not achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. But this is not the case. Zhuge Liang said in the Later List to the Emperor: "I will exhaust my efforts and die thereafter." Wen Tianxiang said in his self-eulogy: "Only when righteousness is exhausted can benevolence be achieved." These two "exhaust" characters are really worth our attention. The word "exhaust" is tantamount to indicating to people a positive meaning. We must actively work hard for the country, and only after exhausting our efforts can we die. Before exhausting our efforts, we really do not need to die, and we cannot die. Wen Tianxiang and the Yuan minister Boluo argued, and there is a paragraph that can be annotated for us. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Boluo said: "And tell me, did any minister in ancient times hand over the ancestral temple, city, and land to another country, and then run away? Is there such a person?" I (referring to Wen Tianxiang) said, "Those who offer the country to others are treacherous ministers. Those who sell the country do so for profit. I resigned as prime minister the other day and did not accept the position. I was sent to Boyan's army front and was detained. Then, a treacherous minister offered the country, and the country was destroyed. I should have died. The reason why I did not die was because Emperor Duzong's two sons were in eastern Zhejiang and my old mother was in Guangdong, so I went there." Boluo also said, "What功勞did you do when you established two kings?" I said: "The country was unfortunately lost. I established a ruler to preserve the ancestral temple. To preserve it for one day, then the ministers will do their duty for one day. Where is the merit?" Boluo said, "If you know you can't do it, why do it?" I said: "Ministers serve the ruler as sons serve their fathers. If the father unfortunately falls ill, even if it is clear that it cannot be done, how can there be no reason to prescribe medicine? I have done my best. Today, Wen Tianxiang is here and will die. Why say more—"</p>
<p>The so-called "should die but did not die" is because a ruler can still be established to preserve the country: the so-called "know you can't do it, so必做" is because as long as the country exists for one day, you must do your duty as a minister for one day. You cannot have negative thoughts because the country is destroyed, and you cannot lose your active heart because things cannot be done. Only when your heart and strength are exhausted, then you can die. This is the so-called "when you should die, you do not die, and you do it when you can do it; when it is really impossible to do it, then you die." (From Xu Youren's Preface to the Biography of Wen Chengxiang of the Yuan Dynasty) This kind of death is upright and honest, with a long-lasting spirit, heavier than Mount Tai, and worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>Today's China is in an era of arduous resistance. Everyone must be able to maintain this positive concept, putting the country and nation above all else, and making military victory the first priority. Swear to achieve it, persist to the end, then the resistance war will surely be won, and the nation-building will surely be achieved. The so-called "should die but not die, and do it when you can do it." Knowing that the environment is difficult and the work is not easy, if you try to get out of this environment and go to a place of harmony, and strive to work, you must not have negative thoughts. Taking death as bravery and giving up life as justice is a loss that does not outweigh the gain, which is neither beneficial to oneself nor to the country. It only makes a meaningless sacrifice, which can only be regarded as a sign of cowardice. Because I am moved by the news in the newspaper about those who are unwilling to sell out and often commit suicide, I wrote this to give further advice to those who stay on the isolated island.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Waves <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zheng</p>
<p>In small rivers, within ditches. The filthy, stagnant water is the most disgusting thing on earth. There, only bacteria are jumping, larvae are singing, and green duckweed and blue reeds will never accompany them.</p>
<p>In lakes, in rivers, the quiet flow of water, the murmuring sound, seem to have little vitality. The space is too lonely, too deep! Staying there, aroused infinite laziness.</p>
<p>What is most worthy of praise is the wave in the river and the sea. It is so vast, and the sound of waves hitting the shore is even more magnificent—</p>
<p>This symbolizes life, a beautiful life, which should have the perseverance of waves. It will not be so quiet, without sound, and forgotten by the world—</p>
<p>In the sea woven by waves, the aquatic creatures that live there all have strong strength!</p>
<p>Waves after waves are rolling on the water surface, and the beautiful spray will not be stopped by any force.</p>
<p>Waves are the rare miracle in the world!</p>
<h3 id="e68">Oath <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Imagining myself walking alone in Peach Blossom Spring or inviting myself to travel in Shanghai; concluding my thatched cottage in an unknown place, like a reclusive scholar. This often makes me wander in the confusing road for a long time.</p>
<p>But the whip of reality cruelly strikes from behind, startling me from my dream. Raising my head, I am deeply amazed. How vast is the world? What is life? Is life a dream?</p>
<p>The sharp hook at the bottom of the question mark grabs my mind, so I carefully look for the answer. I start to learn, to learn how to live.</p>
<p>A friend said, "I am seeking a change. Come and take my crutch!" But, where should I 朝述述? Extending a helping hand to the world, who will lead me onto the avenue of life?</p>
<p>Isn't it shameful to live in the pity and sympathy of others? I hesitated again. I withdrew my hand, but I started to walk. I want to rely on my own strength to walk. The road to truth will never lack like-minded partners. But we should not always stretch out our pale hands to others. If we are tired, we will fall. What does it matter? We have already exhausted our last breath for opening the way. One drop of blood is a mark in history. A complete page is made up of accumulated traces.</p>
<p>Discard the gray lenses of those who look backward. Do not remember yesterday. Do not bitterly mourn and regret the passing of what. Why always wander in the old courtyard, being someone who lingers on the scenery of the past?</p>
<p>We must learn to discard the ugly legacy left by the past, grasp today, and not let go of every moment in a sigh. Tomorrow will be a new day, with joy, with happiness, with a sunny day, which is an oath.</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Gate of Struggle <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qing</p>
<p>At dawn, a few sparse, light-colored morning stars still hung in the sky. The earth was shrouded in a layer of mist. Around me, there were only unclear houses and the outlines of streets. People were still in warm dreams, waiting for a loud sound to wake them up.</p>
<p>The steady and resolute footsteps of a young man echoed in the air. His face was submerged in the mist. He stopped in front of an open door and glanced at the wall. On both sides of the wall were the two large characters "Struggle." Without hesitation, he wanted to raise his foot and step into the door. Suddenly, an old man with white hair appeared in the door and stopped him with his hand. Clear words came from the old man's mouth.</p>
<p>"Hey! What are you here for?"</p>
<p>"I want to enter this gate of struggle." The voice was as calm as a waveless sea, deep and clear. One word was said intermittently, "To struggle"!</p>
<p>The old man's face was solemn: "Every day, I don't know how many people come here, but many of them go in and come back out... "</p>
<p>"No, I will not come back, unless I get what I want. I came here with the greatest determination."</p>
<p>"What are you going through? Is it like them, to gain survival and liberation in this 'struggle'?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I want. We have been bullied too much by others. We must wake up and give tit for tat. They did not recognize us before, but now there is new life, get up and struggle."</p>
<p>"Struggle, you have to know that this is not something you can just say. You look inside, this is true. Ah! Here! Here there is only death." As he spoke, the old man opened his body.</p>
<p>He poked his head in and took a look. Inside, the ground was covered with bright red and purplish-black blood, and piles of white bones were scattered around. Even more so, cries of agony, curses, and angry voices were mixed together, making it feel very gloomy and frightening. But he was not afraid. No, he had already seen the light behind it. He said even more resolutely and calmly,</p>
<p>"Death and bloodshed do not make me feel cold. In order to seek survival and liberation, death and bloodshed are necessary. I have long abandoned this."</p>
<p>"Death and bloodshed do not make you wary. But you turn around and look. Your mother, brothers and sisters, and lover at home are anxiously waiting for you to return, to give you comfort, to give you love; and the beautiful music, the fragrant wine, they are also waiting for you to enjoy. All this is so lovely, why not go back there?"</p>
<p>"Enjoy? Enjoying is not the time now. Let those things go to 　　. As for my relatives, I think they will soon come to this gate of struggle, for their survival and liberation. All love grows in the gate of struggle."</p>
<p>"Young man, come in—I wish you victory, and I will always bless you, may you succeed."</p>
<p>The young man gratefully stepped into the gate of struggle. Looking inside, suddenly all the gloomy things disappeared, and blood-red flowers were blooming everywhere, seemingly nodding and smiling at him.</p>
<p>He looked up again: light was rising in front of him.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>The sounds of footsteps in the corridor constantly disturbed their uneasy hearts; it was as if any detective or gendarme could walk into every room in the city for a case, and now, they were about to be inspected. If they were caught an instant before they left, how would they answer the armed comrades in the field? Therefore, Yuwen paced back and forth anxiously, just like when she first arrived at his home, finally, he went to hold her hand – this was the second time. Before he could speak, she asked:</p>
<p>"Do you want to shoot me again?"</p>
<p>"Ah, Zhulin, don't be like this! Listen to me—"</p>
<p>"I won't listen, I won't listen, not at all—" She was extremely angry. Hitting his chest, she also shouted: "You forced me here with a gun, force me back with a gun again!..."</p>
<p>"When you came, it was because you were an outsider. When you leave, you are already our comrade; our guns are not prepared for our comrades."</p>
<p>"I don't care!..."</p>
<p>"Zhulin, listen! Listen to me, the reason for you to go home is, for example, if you don't go back this time, it doesn't matter, we also hope you can work with us immediately. However, you should consider that your father will definitely think we have harmed you and taken his money—"</p>
<p>"Then I can write a letter to tell him!"</p>
<p>"No matter what, he can't get you, and his money is wasted, isn't that right?" She nodded, indicating she accepted his opinion.</p>
<p>"If we need to do the same thing again for money in the future, because of your influence, which family would be willing to spend money to hire people again? Isn't that right?"</p>
<p>She didn't want to nod again to indicate agreement, but the logic of his words prevented her from denying him.</p>
<p>"You are a smart sister, you should understand our difficulties. You are a good comrade, you should help our work, shouldn't you?"</p>
<p>She nodded again, indicating that she agreed with his opinion.</p>
<p>"Then, you go home now!"</p>
<p>However, she cried bitterly. Because she had obeyed everyone else's reasons in everything, and violated her own wishes.</p>
<p>Finally, she had no choice but to leave, she said:</p>
<p>"Alright, I believe you—"</p>
<p>So, he cheered up and hurried to wipe the tears from her face, and helped her put on her coat. She couldn't bear to leave the room and stopped for a long time. She asked him:</p>
<p>"Can't I stay one more night?"</p>
<p>"No. Go on."</p>
<p>"But I hope to see you again in the future!"</p>
