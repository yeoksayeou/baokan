<h3 id="c1">遠東國際形勢的新階段 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>天津日×已於本月十四日晨起，封鎖英法租界，要挾英法當局，接受其無理要求。事態之嚴重，不祇可視爲鼓浪嶼豋陸事件的「再版」，並且關係歐美列强整個在遠東的生命。如果英法此次再行對日表示屈服，接受無理要求，則日×侵犯列强遠東權益的兇燄必更猖狂飛騰，不僅中國的門戶將爲其完全關閉，整個亞洲亦將成爲日本××獨霸的範圍，進而實現田中義一奏則中的「征服世界」了！</p>
<p>然而日本××最近此種兇暴行爲，與其視爲對歐美列强的「挑釁」，毋寧視爲政治的外交的攻勢，陰謀解救其侵華軍事且前所遭遇的困難而已。誠如十四日倫敦每日電訊報所稱：「日本屢次造成事件，似有一固定之目的。考其原因，實由於日本征服中國之企圖，進行遲緩。此事不但日本知之。中國人亦知之。日本爲挽囘其面子，乃不惜以任意破壞第三國之利益爲手段。此事與其謂爲日本之强橫，毋寧應視作日本之微弱無能」。</p>
<p>正因爲日人此種暴行之建文於本身「微弱無能」的基礎之上，所以卽在此種投機，取巧，胃險，嚇詐的行動中，亦隨時隨處表現其避實攻虛避强擊弱的戰略：它們對外蒙挑釁，但當蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在其外交演說中一述及「蘇聯保衛外蒙之决心無異於蘇聯邊境」之後，日×卽掩旗息鼓，悄然遁去；它們對歐美列强挑釁，如鼓浪嶼事件以至封鎖天津租界，但其目標則集中於　　　　的最易妥協的英國，而對美國則表示並無敵意。</p>
<p>雖然，日×此種陰謀，已將爲舉世共見的事實。目前英國人民及全國與論，已經熱烈一致要求對臼强硬，美法兩國，亦有切實合作對付遠東事件的明白表示，蘇聯固最早即已呼籲英美法蘇聯合援華，並在英蘇談判中堅持反侵略陣綫應包括遠東在內，我們中國，則更已從事實上表現了不僅能够保衛本國之生存與獨立而抗戰，並且正在爲英美法各國抵抗共同的×人已經快到兩年了！目前問題就在：英美法各國願意在日×這種投機取巧冒險嚇詐之下屈服，而相率退出中國退出遠東？還是　　採取集體行動予日×以適當必要的教訓，而獲得榮譽的眞正的和平？前者是　　，後者則是唯一的生路。</p>
<p>目前中國及蘇聯固不待說，美法等國亦在努力爲促使各國走上援華制臼的生路而奮鬥。據十四日電訊，美國眾院外委會已全體通過局部修改中立法，取消禁運軍火案，國務院於檢討遠東政策時並一致主張積極推進反侵略行動。同日電訊又稱英法合作卽將擴展到遠東，兩國遠東軍要已於今日起前赴新加坡進行軍事會議，討論實行遠東軍事合作了，此外蘇聯艦隊，據傳亦有於日內舉行太平洋大演習的消息。</p>
<p>中國兩年來的英勇抗戰，已經暴露了日本侵略者的「微弱無能」，已經大大改變了國際的形勢，而反侵略行動，亦已在事實上有如上述的逐漸擴展到遠東來了！讓天津事件根本粉碎民主國家的妥協政策吧！讓天津事件作爲建立遠東反侵略陣線的端由吧！讓日本侵略者用封鎖天津租界的行動來掘深它自己的墳墓吧！</p>
<h3 id="c2">戰時教育的訓導法 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 澤民</p>
<p>（一）培養學生的新道德</p>
<p>我們所說的新道德，就是抗日戰士應具有的各種良好品性及三民主義的新中國建設者應具有的各種良、好品性；抗日戰士及新中國的建設者，必須具有健全的民族意識及集團的精神，只有了這種意識及精神還不够，還必須具有爲民族利益及集團利益蕾鬥，不怕犧牲以及互助自動的各種品性。</p>
<p>舊的道德教育，可分兩方面來說；一方面是忽視了政治，也可說是脫離了政治，單單從道穗上着想；以爲單是道德教靑，就是把每個人的公德私德倍養得很好，就可以使中國復興起來。另一方面是這種「道德教育　實在是代表樑統治者的政治思想，不過是故意掩蔽起自己的政治面目，不　別人知道自己的眞正目的；譬如在日本帝國主義指使下開辦的許多學校（在淪陷區），讀什麼五經四書，這明明是製造奴隸，以達到其長期統治中國的目的，但是它還在宣揚什麼「爲中國人民謀幸福」呢？還在宣揚自己「沒有任何政治目的」呢？</p>
<p>對於這些舊的道德教育，我們要亳不容情的揭露它的眞面目，廣佈它的罪惡，予以致命的打擊，使它不能繼續存在。抗戰教靑的新道德底培養，不但不掩蔽自己的政治面目，而且擇取最正確的政治要求作爲自己的訓導，目僄。</p>
<p>（二）過去的道德教育只注重到書本上口頭上的訓導</p>
<p>紙上談道德，講得有條有理，可惜只是談談說說而已。說的人自己不肯去做，聽的人也不過聽聽而已。過去的校長教授先生們，對學生總是愛說「光明，正大，堂皇，美麗」的話，但自己却在作着各種不芷當的事情；過去的官員老爺們，總是滿口的「淸廉，公正，愛民，負責」等的好聽的漂亮話，但他却貧贓賣法，勾結土劣欺壓良民。這種的言行背馳，如何能叫人去跟着做呢？因此，過去的道德教育，只不過是不賣行的老生常談。</p>
<p>目前所需要的新道德，不是空談而是實踐的表現，新的道德也只存在於實踐行動中。民族意識如果不表現在直接間接的抗戰行動上，集團精神如果不表現在集團精神上，犧牲，勇敢如果不表現在拚棄小我，爲爭取民族各益及集團幸福的奮鬥上，則所謂民族意識，集團精神，犧牲奮鬥……等都是空的；新道德只有表現在實踐行爲中，也只有在行爲中才能看出你的品性。抗戰教育所訓導的培養的新道德就是這樣的。</p>
<p>三　過去學校的訓導方式與抗戰教育誤導方式的區別</p>
<p>過去學校訓導學生是採取高壓政策，使學生不動，不敢動：學校當局定出了很嚴格的校規，以嚴厲的懲罰爲手段，强迫學生服從，以養成學生的盲從習慣及奴隸性，這正像帝國主義强迫殖民地的人民服從殖民地政府所頒佈的法律一樣。</p>
<p>抗戰教育要反對高壓政策的訓導法，因爲我們不願意當亡國奴，所以也反對訓練綿羊似的順民；我們現在需要的是富有積極性及自動性的戰士，只有這樣的戰士，才能戰勝日×，才能建設新中國。這樣的戰士，絕不是採用高壓政策的訓導方式所能培養出來的</p>
<p>有人說：「抗戰教育反對高壓政策，就是不要學生遵守紀律。」恰恰相反，我們要求學生的生活各方面都紀律化，生活的紀律絕對必要，但維持紀律的方法，是由學生自己制定生活公約，自己去執行。自己開會討論；務使這個公約爲每個同學所了解，使每個同學都覺得這個公約是合乎自己要求的，大家都自覺自願的遵守這個公約，這樣便能培養學生的自覺自動的習慣及能力。</p>
<p>有了生活公約，但是還不能保證就沒有一個人去違犯生活公約，個別的落後份子有時會遠犯的，對於違反生活公約的份子，要予以制裁，但這種制裁，並不是由某個人或學校當局去制裁，而是個集團的制裁。這樣的制裁與過去制裁也不同，過去的制裁只是消極的懲罰，輕則記過，重則開除，學生受了這樣重大的處罰，還不知道爲什麼，抗戰教育主張積極的服從，使犯過的人，明瞭自己的錯誤，承認自己的錯誤，並且下决心改正錯誤；我們主張的集體制裁，不是大家來打擊他而是幫助他，幫助他改正錯誤，使成為一個更積極更健全的抗戰幹部。</p>
<p>（四）集團競賽是促進學生生活紀律化的有效方法</p>
<p>怎樣集團競賽呢？就是在一定的期間，克服某一顯著的共同弱點爲競賽的目標，譬如現在一般學生的生活較散漫，那麼我們應當集中力量爲克服這一弱點而突擊。訂立競賽公約時，應對準每一時期的共同弱點，舉行級與級組與組的競賽，由每個競賽單位，定出自己的競賽計劃，經過參加競賽的人廣泛深刻的討論，大家都認爲很恰當了，然後决定，决定之後，大家便應爲完成計劃，超過計劃爭取優勝而努力。</p>
<p>集團競賽有兩種好處，因爲競賽是集團的不是個人的，所以要想取得優勝，必須是這一集團的每個份子都很健全，這樣先進的份子便必須幫助落後的份子，落後的必須很快的趕上前進的，因此便大大的發揚了互助精神。這是一。競賽公約是學生自己制定，又是學生自己執行，爲了爭取優勝，必須自已管理自己，這樣便能鍛練學生的自治能力，這是二。</p>
<p>（五）自我批評是求進步的武器</p>
<p>無論團體或個人，在工作過程中，都免不了要發生些缺點，一個人或一個團體要想沒有缺點，除非它不工作。問題不在乎有沒有缺點而在乎肯不肯克服缺點。不怕有缺點，只怕不肯克服缺點。有了缺點肯祖白的承認並下决心克服缺點，這樣便能慢慢克服缺點使自己進步，假使一個人有了缺點就克服，那麼這個人便能不斷的進步。自己的缺點，自己往往看不出來，就需要別人批評，別人指導，因此便需要經常的開生活檢討會，生活檢討會應當規定一定的開食時間，在開會時，對於各個人的工作或生活，都要詳細檢討。首先應該是自己對自己的批評，再由別人互相批評，批評一定要其體，指出缺點，這些缺點表現什麼地方，這些缺點對工作有什麼害處，怎樣克服。在討論的時候，每個人都要盡量發表自已的意見。</p>
<p>生活檢討會一方面能够幫助一個人克服那些缺點，又可以在這個會上得到教訓，就有人犯過的錯誤，每個人便能明白這些缺點，不致再重犯這些缺點。</p>
<p>怎樣保證批評過的缺點能够克服呢？必須成立嚴格的檢查制度，就是在每次會議上嚴格檢奎上次議决案執行的程度，每個人對於自己承認的缺點是否已經糾正，如果沒有糾正。是不是有什麼困難，如果有困難，就要討論出解决困雖的具體辦法，同時每個人要在日常生活中注意幫助他克服缺點。</p>
<p>自我批評，不僅要批評缺點，而且要發楊優點，一個人或一個團體的優良成績，生活中工作中的模範作風，也應該發揚廣大，這一方面是爲了鼓勵優點繼續發揚，同時又讓別人學習各種優點。</p>
<p>總之，時刻開檢討會，檢討工作執行程度，批評缺點發揚優點，這樣便能促進個人或團體的進步，使工作很快的完成。</p>
<p>六　師生關係要親密要敬愛</p>
<p>還去學校對學生採取高壓政策，因此過去學生對教師是表面恭敬，暗中對立，甚至公開反對。抗戰教育的教師不應該使學生怕而應該使學生敬，不應該使學生恨而應該使學生愛，學生的錯誤，帮助他糾正；學生的優點，也要帮助他發揚。這并不是放任主義，包辦主義，也不是代替學生做工作，而是與學生生活在一起，學習在一起，工作在一起，在實踐工作中共同克服困難，發揚優點，使師生間互相了解，五相進步，互相敬愛。</p>
<h3 id="c3">民革社記者李莊：請看今日之平津　黑暗和光明交相映輝　—下— <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>二、如此北平</p>
<p>北平因係傀儡政俯的所在地，所以表面上還似乎很安定，在城內幾乎看不出什廠戰時氣象來，可是這種安定究竟是假的，在晚間時常聽到近郊淸晣的槍聲</p>
<p>一般商人莫不叫苦連天，因爲苛捐雜稅和生意蕭條的關係，販賣一天比一天賠錢，可是殘暴無理的×軍，又壓迫樑不許你隨便歇業。在以前，×軍滿街的亂揮亂跑，買東西不給錢，亨得利鐘鏢店就曾經因之而受極大損失，這不是許多事件當中的一個例子而已。爲了實施其欺騙』麻醉掛羊頭賣狗肉的政治陰謀，×在北平『警備司令』曾藉口有碍國際觀瞻，而下令嚴禁此種不法行爲。滿街胡撞的浪當『皇軍』，現在比較少了點了，並且他們買東西也還給些錢，可是他們給的錢都是偽鈔，并且值一元的至多只給八毫。</p>
<p>北平城內並不常發生投擲炸彈的事情，這主要是由於進城時檢查太嚴的緣故，城門口經常的站着三個日本兵，他們都是全副武裝，一價中國警察，只拿着一口鐵片刀，進城門時，須要經過一番嚴格的檢查，住在旅館中更不知一夜檢查多少次，一般的說起來大旅能中檢查的比較鬆，小旅館中檢查的比較嚴。</p>
<p>無論×人如何誇大的鼓吹繁榮恢復，可是實際上商業是一天比一天衰落了，×人有組織有計劃的把皮，毛，麻等三種與軍事有關的商業，壟斷起來了，但因爲四郊游擊隊活躍的緣故，他們也並不能獲得利益，而中國經營此種商業的商店也不得不因而關門大吉了，其他的商店也門堪羅雀，蕭條到使人見了難過的程度。</p>
<p>不過一般的現象當中也有反常的轉殊現象，可以表現在旅館與飯店的畸形發達上，一般行將就木的封建餘孽與喪心病狂的漢奸紛紛一進京求官一，他們以搜括所及的民脂民膏，無吝惜的花天酒地。</p>
<p>政府的要人們輕易都下敢出來，成天假自作禁關一樣的躱在狹小房子裏保險箱裏。他們自己也知道漢奸是人民的公×，人人均可得而誅之。</p>
<p>不少的中學及小學在×人的刺刀下開了學、課程的內容盡是些『皇軍』的神威與一王道樂土」……較高的學校如北京大學，×人恢復了並翁辦了漢奸製造機關的新民學院，但是×人無論怎樣的鼓吹和獎勵，求學者仍然是寥寥無幾，教會學校如燕京大學等仍然勉强開學，雖然有外國旗子，但仍不能避免×人的壓迫與摧殘，學生的數目也一天比一天减少了。</p>
<p>漢奸的報帋，有好幾種，鎭日××「皇軍」英勇與黨軍潰滅之類，但是被×人蒙住眼晴的民眾們，如果注意推敲的話，也仍然從他們那沒有注意到或無從避免的字裏行間看出一點眞實的情况來，一個漢奸的報帋上登載着這樣一段消忠，遼縣民眾受行將潰滅的抗日政府和共產軍之指揮，將城內什牧搬運一空，皇軍飲食，至感困難，且道路多被破瓖行軍也極感不便。</p>
<p>一般的物價較戰前增了三分之一，有若干東西根本買不到——比如與軍需品有關的東西，西洋貨價格較高，日本貨價格較低，這主要是因爲進口的日本貨幾乎等于沒有稅的緣故。</p>
<p>一般民眾們都是敢怒而不敢言，他們的救亡情緒，一般的說起來都很高，他們整天的希望樑國軍能早一點打到北平，雖然遭受着嚴重的迫害與禁止，可是他們仍舊要在教育機關中，收到一些抗戰的眞實消息許多人有收音機，和沒有收普機的人常常交換「情報」，他們已經完全淸楚明白了×人的統治，無論如何不能超過大砲的射程以外，並且他們都相信最後的勝利一定是我們的。在咫尺還近的西郊，就有我們游擊隊經常的活動樑，離北平較遠的縣份，×人的統制，當然更是薄弱，以至等於零，偽「值隸省長」高逆凌霄，就曾經無恥的而發過一無省可長」的哀嗚。</p>
<p>三、「皇協軍」也帮助我們</p>
<p>×人因兵力非常簿弱，所以大部份還利用皇協軍的力量來統治，不過這種隊伍是靠不住的，這種情形，×人自己似乎也知道，所以自始至終只趕把他們放在不很重要的地方，來担任「警戒」。在離北平不遠的×××駐紮若一國皇協軍，這一團皇協軍，曾經和我們的××軍訂了「互不侵犯的條件」，他們每天要供給××軍兩箱子彈，並且在××軍破壞道路或電桿時，他們還不能出來干涉。</p>
<p>事情大概是出于×人意料之外的，許多皇協軍經常的給我們很多的幣助，如子彈的供給，和重要軍用品代爲購買之類，有一次我們十九個××軍的便衣隊被皇軍的哨兵排扣住了，但是我們這十九個英勇的××軍却毫不畏懼的給他們諱了一片做人的大道理，也許這些皇協軍在那時候發現了一點天良，絲毫沒有損害地把他們這十幾個人放去了。</p>
<p>四、罪惡的天津</p>
<p>從北平到天津。一畫夜經當有三次客車，白天兩次，夜間一次不過夜間那一次幾乎全是空軍，因爲沒有人敢冒險，『十次行車，九次出軌』的意料中的危險。</p>
<p>×人在天津比在北平更加荒淫與無恥，可是我們在天津也有比在北平更大的潛勢力。</p>
<p>首先，天津的物價與北平相仿，比事變前上漲了百分之三十，歐美貨少而昂貴，日本貨却充斥着而又便宣。</p>
<p>無論誰看見現在的天津，都會說「一天不如一天了」，的確，一般較大的商業完全被×人壟斷起來，大多數的日本貨。都是經了日本洋行的手，直接運送到外縣去，中國商店一方面因了生意蕭條，一方面有苛捐和重稅的高壓，那能不一天比一天的衰落下去？可是爲了「整飾市容」又不允許你隨隨便便地「關門大吉」。</p>
<p>×軍在天津和在北平不同胡鬧的，成都要比較大一點，大部份要路口全都佈置了砂包，由武裝整齊的日本兵把守樑，但是盡管×的警戒再森嚴一點，我們的游擊隊仍然不時的衝入×人的警戒綫裏，市區中炸彈案是屢見不鮮的，在去年陰歷十一月廿三日，日租界中一電影院公開放映侮辱　蔣委員長的影片，但開映不久，卽有人拋入一顆炸彈，結果死傷了十四個人，投炸彈的勇士，却安然躱避了。在中原公司，在電車上……都不時發生炸彈的案子。</p>
<p>×人千方百計的圖謀，破瓖法幣，所以屢屢下令或尅日把法幣換成偽鈔，或尅日每人携帶法幣不得過一百元，可是這種狗屁的命令，只有鬼子遵照實行呢，法幣的信用反而因了×人的圖謀破壞而相反的德定鞏固起來，在英法租界中依然存在着我們的法幣銀行，人們可以隨時掉換破爛了的法幣，法幣在英法租界中與偽鈔成九與十之比——偽鈔在租界中根本不甚通行，在日租界中相反的都成十與九之比，在河北——中國地——成十與十之比，不過一般較大的商號全部把法幣藏起來，把偽鈔儘先　出去，所以爲數並不太多的偽鈔現在弄得到處遭白眼飛來飛去，誰拿到誰頭痛，賣際上一塊法幣比一塊偽鈔要買的很多的東西。</p>
<p>在天津可以見到的偽票非常多，偽『中國聯合準備銀行』，朝鮮銀行，滿洲銀行，都有鈔票在天津流通着，但其通漪的範圍與信用，則遠不及我法幣及何北省鈔，×因見我法幣的信用不可動搖的鞏固，所以最近就大批僞　起來，以卅元真法幣，換一百元假法幣的比例換給漢奸由漢奸拿到市去，以澈底的擾亂。</p>
<p>漢奸的報糾非常多，較大的有庸報，新天津報，滿洲報，朝鮮臼報等。這種報紙的編緝簡直不是人他們甘膽稱我們的軍隊爲「×軍」，看這種報紙的人非常少。如果有的話，也不過是一些爲少數得可憐的商人，但是他們看這種報紙並不在於千篇一律的「皇軍進攻××」或「××黨軍全部消滅」而見藉此以搶取些「對於他們有切身利害的商業行情，這種報既也「所謂「副刊，他們的『副刊』充滿了『怎樣模突兒有『怎樣性交』之類。</p>
<p>英法租界中流行着我們的報紙，常常一個人在租界中看了以後，囘來傳誦給許多人，×對於去英租界的人，檢查得非常嚴厲：他們沿河布置上密密層層的電網，於是去租界的人非由法國橋經過不可了，有許多調霉的人有時候從早等到日中，仍舊不能通過去，圖謀這樣行爲，×人自己的解釋，是××租界中藏有大批的口口軍，並且某某軍時刻在圖謀擾亂秩序。</p>
<p>天津的民氣非常激昂。這種現象，可以從　夕發生的炸彈案件上看出來。他們肹望着自己的軍隊，自己的飛機，但是天空中却常常有漆着膏藥標誌的使他們見了頭痛的法西鐵島飛過去，但是在夜　更深的時修，常常聽到我游擊隊的槍聲，這却是最使人興奮　。</p>
<p>在天津時常有很多好人，不知爲什麼緣故不淸不白的失蹤被捕。</p>
<p>京戲與「綁子」大部份是完全恢復了，他們那精采的節目是「三娘教子」「遵龍偷鳳」與「烈女傳」之類，電影院也恢復了好幾家，他們的內容不外一緣軍消滅」「大腿」等，不過電影院似乎還沒有京戲院的生意興隆，原因是大概因爲電影院中常常發生炸彈案。</p>
<p>日租界活生生的變成了一座魔窟，傍曉時家家收音梯都播送　僅人肉的的淫聲浪調，鴉片館，睹陣場，妓院跳舞廳，按摩院……以外是白面，偽鈔，和平空氣漢奸等的製造機關，街上貼滿了「性病治療」「壯陽丸」「淋病一日愈」令人見了作嘔的廣告，妓院賭博場大多數爲韓人所經營，由日本人加以保護與　助，漢奸偽幣等的製造機關，則全部由日本持務機關來經營。</p>
<p>在天津談話的時候，非常困難、因爲不知道那一個人究竟是漢奸，許多漢奸常常偽裝成×愾同仇的樣子，以騙你說出中國人應該說的話，然後袖出手槍來把你擄到日本租界去。</p>
<p>×人的統治非常薄弱，我們的游擊隊隊了在四郊活動外，還不時的派便衣隊到市區內去活動，常常弄得×人驚慌失措，窘熊百出，有一次在河北一個十字路，突然饗了一排手檢，於是弄得津市×軍，全體紛紛出動，日本租界馬上戒嚴，重機關槍，小砲都架上了，可是放槍的便衣隊，却隨隨便便的退出去了，幾顆子彈，弄得成千的×人一夜沒能睡好覺。</p>
<p>不只×人對於我們無法統治，就是×人自己的內部也常常發出嚴重的裂痕，去年陰曆十月間，發生了這樣的一件事情：</p>
<p>駐津×海軍奉命返國休息，但遇到駐津×陸軍的熱烈反對，固此輩陸軍均係自關外調來，出國數載曾未返國休息，海陸待遇，似太不平等，結果雙方竟武裝衝突，激戰一畫夜，年方的死傷，共計二百餘人，後來經各國的領事調停奔走與海陸軍雙方當局的斥責，戰事始告平息，還有在不久以前發生的大沽口日軍譁變的事件，亦可視爲×軍內部分裂的一個好例子。</p>
<p>五、尾聲</p>
<p>平津這兩個華北的大城，現在的確充滿了血腥齷促，慘殺與恐怖，不過在我們堅持持久抗戰不得到最後勝利决不中止的形勢下，在國際情勢日益好轉的場合下，在×寇國內反戰運動日益彭湃的條件下，我們相信——堅决地相信，在不久的將來，他們——平津——一定會重新挿遍靑天白日旗，重新見天日。</p>

<p>【民革社通訊稿】晉冀察邊區主任胡梅亭教育處長劉定庵于前月廿二日來到　嵐，除在廿三日發動了一個熱烈的歡迎晚會，廿四日晚上戰動總會又召開了一個茶話會，在這個會上胡劉二同志詳細的講述了邊區的金融貿易政策，以及最近一次怎樣粉碎×人圍攻的經過，茲錄其後者如下：</p>
<p>「晉冀察邊區無論在軍事上政治上經濟上都給了×人以嚴重的打擊，使×人懷恨在心，時欲一舉而「剿滅」，去年八月，×人打算抽調四個師國圍攻邊區，後來因兵力不足，只抽調了兩個師團約五萬人。未舉動館卽派大批訓練過的漢奸混入邊區。邊區政府阜已覺察。十月初間，×人開始了十路圍攻，定襄代縣繁峙靈邱蔚縣　源保定各一路，此外又由石莊攻我平上，由正太路攻我孟縣，×人此次進攻兵力，糧秼俱足，所以估計到×人將會据守幾個据點，同時便將這些據點聯絡起來，五台山將會變爲游撃區，根据這個估計，便實行堅號淸野，將主要機關轉移地區。那時我軍以兵力不佔優勢，四面應戰，必定吃虧，乃决定放鬆南北，集中火力對付東西。×人軍事上的弱點是『死守命令缺少機動』奉命會師五台山，我們抓×以人這個弱點，在通五台山的路上，便澈底堅壁淸野住困×人，我軍先打由曲陽到阜平的主力，×兵千餘，卽殲五百，後×人增兵三千，我軍遂放棄阜平，經過一番堅壁淸野的工作，阜平城內只剩滿街滿巷的×爲軍標語而已，結果×雖佔據阜平城，但粮秣須仰給後方。我軍乃專打×人給養，使×人不得不因給養困難撤退。我軍估計到大×將退，乃實行測擊尾擊，×人損失奇重。彼時阜平只留數百×人固守，經我軍予以奇襲。乃突圍而竄，我軍與民眾呼喊追逐，打死×人一半以上，西路方面，我軍事先隱避于五台山周圍，×人進至五台山後，大部又撤囘城內，×數百人曾出截襲我駐河口之部隊，得相當便宜得意而返，路經險要地區石盆口，遭我伏擊全部消滅。只逃出數人，南北兩路之×本爲呼應，北路×早經擊黃，南路×由孟縣開來，一支孤軍約千餘人，到五台山後被我包圍，此股全是日兵，因武器優良，未能全部消滅，圍一星期多，自動撤退，死數百人及司令官一人，×人這一次圍攷，在我游擊戰術的正確運用和堅壁淸野的配合下，遭到憾敗了！現在只有五台，河邊，東冶等地，尙殘留着少數人！」</p>
<p>這一段事實告訴了我們，只要正確的運用游擊戰術，配合以民眾的力量，兇惡的×人是不難消滅的。我們應該學習這一寶責的經驗教訓！</p>

<p>此次學潮起因，是爲學生反對日籍學生彭某爲總班長，××××××××××××××××××××××××××××。平心而論，學生而果欲干涉學校行政，决不肯僅以消極的出走了某而且學生以求學爲天職，課餘有暇，亦亟待有正當的娛樂，何苦—又何必—干涉學校行政？身爲學生而至於拋棄學業，與其平臼所親近之學校當局相持不下，××××××××××××××××，所以我們認爲這次拔萃學潮的發生；學生方面忍痛出走，實近於古人所說的「直諫」决不可　亦不忍—加以「干涉學校行政」的大罪名。</p>
<p>據拔萃當局變再表示，對於中國抗戰、向表同情，以一興國籍人尙有如此伺情的感覺，×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××；我們只要承認拔萃學生的出走，並不是干涉學校行政而只是愛國心的自然流露，便可斷定這事解决的辦法極爲簡單，就是由該校當局和出走學生，本平日師生之誼，赤誠一談，一方面由學校方面自動以更換總班長，一方面卽由出走學生自動的復課。×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××，我們要取「快刀斬亂蔴」的手段，一了百了，眼見風潮平靜以後，拔萃師生的感情，還要比過去更深一層!</p>

<p>— 流螢</p>
<p>龍華的雨夜</p>
<p>雨天的黃昏，鄉村間總有凝着一簇簇的炊烟在屋頂上，但，龍華墟却沒有這種現象。我們到太和墟遠望龍華，那聚有百多間華罷的店戶，顯示出它的魚頭爛額，不比往常能像鵪鶉羣般蟄居實了，趁壞的人們，做生意的人們都你肩我背，向東西南北散開去，丟下了一個灰燼的破殘的市鎭，伴着這個雨後的慘談的黃昏。</p>
<p>我們對了龍華，經過的市街是斷墻殘瓦，嗅着那焦燥的氣味，這味道在燒焦了的土墻上面遇了雨濕蒸騰得更厲害，一陣陣撲到鼻腔，我們更領略到「皇軍」的「火力」——這味道是會起化學作用，增高我們的熱度的啊！</p>
<p>經過福昌官面前，有許多茅草蓋搭的小亭式的攤位，地上是給足踏踐得　爛，而且蔗渣，果皮，和都市市場收市後給淸道佚掃除時所應該發現的　西都有．不過人是早已散盡了．我們意識到，這就是我們戰時民眾的臨時市場．同時更使我囘憶到童年時聽教師說的「日中爲市」的故事。</p>
<p>我們跑過了全市，沒有一家完整的屋子，除了發現幾處在燒餘的簽下有衣衫　褸的老婦人或中年婦女携了小孩，在那臨時把磚片砌成的火爐上炊煮外，其他到處寂無人影。這個給×人燒殺後的市鎭的情景，我實在沒有法子來形容她的蕭條和慘狀，只有心裏增加悲痛。</p>
<p>我們到了鄉公所，會見了李鄉長郁　，脫下了邊透的衣服，大家都感覺些冷了，幸得這獲發給難民的棉衣還未發完，每個人都惜一件來披上去，男女都穿上這樣的衣，恰像難民羣。我們要求解决肚子問題，叫姚庶務（我們臨時指定的）去籌辦，他飛也似地跑出了去，一剎那間跑囘來，囘答是：「什麼都買不到，連米也成問題」。我們有些樑急，特別是十多個挑夫，後來向鄉長討論，請他設法，結果已有了辦法。睡呢？這問題又擺在目前了，宇宙用了黝黑來催促我們解决這問題，然而也不困難，「各人自掃鬥前雪」，纘神　的，借門板的，……在各種形式之下也解决了。</p>
<p>衣，食，住三問題解决後，我們就要解决「行一的問題了，這裏宣傳工作應該怎樣做？明天要如何跑完到長寧至福田這一段路，沿途要怎樣做宣傳工作？淤是乎　我們來了一個晚會。會中各人報告了在龍華剛才的工作，「靑抗會那邊沒有一個人在，沒有法子接洽。」「告民眾書已貼完了。」一口頭宣傳沒有法子進行，只有向幾個老太婆訪問。」……檢討結果是：「估計不够，佈置不好。」</p>
<p>會中决定明天行程及工作後，還唱了幾支歌，來喊起這個沉寂的死市。可不是麼，整整一個晚上，什麼聲普都沒有，遠處的狗呋聲都沒有聽見，</p>

<p>『黑地獄』的作者平諾克氏　曾經隨着這位偷運專家，沿着那邊境山隘一帶作了次約二百哩旅程的視察，現在他來告訴你些他的見聞。在荷蘭吉德蘭省一間屋子里，他見到了五十件精緻的長方形的包裹。鞋盒般大小，標誌在黃色的包皮紙外面的字，說是飼養畜類用的油餅，其實呢，每件包裹裏面却不折不扣的藏着五十份「旗報」那是一份八版的報紙，紙張是眞小得可以，只有七寸寬和五字長，小號的鉛字印在印度的薄紙上，却十足具有着跟大型報一般的精華。他說：「在德國的時候，曾經有人告訴我，「　報」會令希特勒和他的手下頭疼，比英法的大砲還盤。」那些熱心偷運工作的人。可全是些業餘的反納粹同志，在德國，他們偷偷地潛到邊界地方，接受了那些秘密包裹，再偷偷地帶囘來。許多雇用的黨徒，便專門做望風和保鏢工作。有時候它們要是被偵騎追得太急的話，還得躱藏在山麓的洞里或森杯的深處，那些地方都僻靜得簡直沒法去找。等到運到德國內部之後，都分別地藏在秘密的地窖里。然後再一份一份地折得只比郵票大一點兒，秘密地帶到市上去分發。</p>
<p>在德比交界的另一段地帶，平民又見到幾千份的『新觀察報』——一種勃拉格的前進週刊，和許多巴黎出版的『新陣綫報』和『社會黨燈塔報』堆集如山，自費利斯蘭到　安頓蘭斯這三百哩地帶，差不多將成了世界偷運事業的一個大本營。直接和間接依靠這門行業生活的，不下二十五萬人。</p>
<p>意大利和瑞士的交界處，也有著同樣的偷運事業：三種反法西斯的新聞紙，『黃口報』，『正義與自由報』和『自由報』，多半是自阿爾卑斯山道中偷題過去的，這些新聞紙，都是先照着普通的四版報紙一樣印出，再用攝影的方法複攝在極薄的米紙上，然後折成個巧小玲瓏的方塊，還不到紙牌的一半大；但是裏面却淸晰地印着幾萬字的驚人消息。此外，又曾經有兩個偷運者，把一千份的『正義與自由報』分藏在皮帶的夾層裏偷進了意大利，在度那重重的山隘時，報紙却是被藏在挖空了的雪撬以及長靴的厚底層獲的，</p>
<p>去年六月十一日，『黃口報』巴黎總部主筆羅滋教授在巴崗遭人狙殺，一般人都相信那是法西斯的爪牙們幹的。法國警務當局雖然查到不少事實，證明那是個含有政治意味的暗殺案，但兇手終究給逃之夭夭了。</p>
<p>『黃口報』偷進意大利，一向是用胃充商品的辦法。不久以前，約有一萬份光景夾在一批肥皂中，由法國搭樑普通車運過來。那肥皂是意大利家庭中最通用的一種貨色，一份一份的報紙便藏在『肥皂用法』的仿單底下，用肥皂的人，一打開包皮紙，便見到那折得小小的報紙。上面載着許許多多阿比西尼亞和西班牙的眞實消息，及其他從未想到的新聞，都是法西斯黨徒們想一手掩盡的。</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年，歐局己緊張時，德美航綿的『凱隆齊柏號』，載樑六百萬金條，到德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去游歷歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅，同時，傑克又興船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛交起朋友來，傑克在代鮑工作，接樑個怪消息……</p>
<p>「現在，且別先顧到那些，」傑克搶着說，「把這報告立刻去送給船長洛克，自己送去，不要經旁人的手，若是給旅客們知道了，他們卽刻就會慌張起來。」</p>
<p>鮑福，仍舊張大着眼睛和嘴巴，飛快的去幹他的差事去了。</p>
<p>「船長洛克大約就要出來了」，魯蒙加羅說。「他會將我們全叫出給去，我們最好現在就出去，但是在事前，我們不能聲張，這船上有二千多乘客，若是他們知道有二條戰艦在追捕我們，那還了得！」</p>
<p>三　無目的的狂奔</p>
<p>一刻鐘之後，傑克正躺在甲權上的椅子上，腦子裏仍舊在研究方才聽得的驚人消息。一名侍役走到了他面前，很謹愼的俯近他說：「船長洛克在無綫電室裏，立刻要見你，請你就去！」</p>
<p>「現在有甚麼事來了？」傑克奇怪起來，他一面向無綫電室走去，一面揣測着，「我想，一定是因爲多事代管了無綫電機，可隣的飽佛，我總得想法子，使他不受責難。我現在是乘客，船主是不能怎樣我的。」</p>
<p>他一面想着，跨進了無綫電室。船長洛克，是個高大的人，樣子很精明，有一大把很好看的鬍子。同在房裏的還有一個船員，海斯鮑佛也在裏面，他很驚恐，看上去已經受了責備了，當傑克走進來的當兒，船長又高又大的身體還正在他面前搖擺着。</p>
<p>「你就是替這個飯桶代管無綫電，讓他去嚼鹹餅約人，是嗎？」他十分威嚴的問傑克，但是，在他眼裏却閃着些異樣的光輝。</p>
<p>傑克從容地點樑頭，承認在鮑佛走出去舒一舒氣的時候，他曾代替管理機器。他準備接受這德國人對他大肆咆哮。但是，出乎意外，船長用手拍着他的背。『不錯！　』他喊着；『你做得很好，否則，這個飯桶沒曾這機器，那英國巡洋艦就會來檢查我們了。現在，我要和你商量，你是个無線電收發員。我們的另一名收發員病了，現在，又必須時刻有个人坐在瓊房裏，你肯就這個職務嗎？」</p>
<p>傑克簡直說不出話來，這個提議是太突如其來了，他一時很難决定。</p>
<p>「你是要我帮忙，一直做到歡洲嗎？」他問。</p>

<p>— 潘叢紹</p>
<p>【本報特訊】駕舟原非雞事、能够操縱自如的、這倒非費若干練習的時間不可、怎樣以橈、以櫓、以竿推舟前進、又如何把持其前進的方向、凡此兩點、雖然駕舟方法非一、而學者所習、不外乎此、</p>
<p>爲着便于理解與實踐、駕舟鍊習就以單橈推舟前行的舢舨駕駛爲開端、這在本欄經已刊出、茲篇所紀、進而爲雙橈運用的練習、</p>
<p>雙橈發水推舟前進的力量當比單橈的爲大、因爲推舟力愈大、其與水相抵的阻力也更大、并且同時按次兼顧着雙橈的運用、初習者所感困難又爲在單橈的練習過程中所未體騐得到的、其次、運用雙橈、撥水使舟前進中、兼施舟行方向的動作、卽不因利用雙橈爲施舵而致舟行速度大減、這不容易辦到</p>
<p>雙橈駕駛洋舨、假如並非單人動作的、當有專司舵者、初學時就利用這個機會、使臂力的運用和手部握舟漸趨熟練、至於多人雙橈駕舟、當因其中駕駛的不得其法、致使舟行速率失其持久的均勻、</p>
<p>一人操兩橈、兩橈撥水的方向同時一樣、駕駛者坐在舟中、面向和舟行方向相反、當身體彎前、雙手向前遽出、所握雙橈已自水中翻出來了、路逾水面往後推去、等到雙手往後拖、雙橈復入水裏、爲了要使橈與水抗的阻力增大、在變橈給撥往前的水途中、身體要　樑往後傾的、給撥往前的雙橈拖出水面上來時、身體復從傾轉爲前向了、這樣雙手握着橈柄、向前推送、卽雙橈跨逾水面往後推去、往後拖去、在水中的變橈卽往前撥、舟行的力量自是發自橈向前撥、與水相抗的動作中、</p>
<p>不久習握橈的掌皮、由於運用擊橈頗覺吃力、至易損破、這個苦頭不難挨下去的、倒是氣力本小的初習者、不惟未及數十橈的撥動、臂膊便倦、且使雙橈在水中、在水面的進退位置不能保持同時同樣的、紛亂起來、</p>
<p>運用變橈、其支點當爲撓與舟舷接觸的一處、手握橈端的爲力點、橈板與水相抵部份爲重點、當重點發生推舟前進的作用時、可留意板面與水相抵的方向、不要斜樑、當然也不能與水正向樑的、雙橈由後撥前的每一進程中、都不要沈的太深、橈板與垂直線所成角度總得維持在三十度下、但在橈板出水與入水之初、務求角度的增大、蓋此能够減少橈水相抵的阻力、亦卽免使多耗手力的辦法、用求兩弊的避免、值得注意、</p>
<p>舟行中改變方向、以雙橈撥水力量之大、事至易爲、例如、要想向左轉、右邊橈與水抵、卽其重力稍爲加强、倘須急轉方向、或大轉灣的、左橈完全停止、右橈重力來得特大、便能達到、雙橈駕舟兼顧方向的動作本無甚難、獨難在到維持一線直行的前進方向、這就必須做到、運用雙橈的重力、在舟行的進程中、都能均勻、一般人、左右手的力量本有多少的差異、復以雙橈在水中或水面的位置未能一致、重力相差更大、亦卽使舟的前進方面不能維持直駛的、</p>
<p>雙橈駕舟的利弊旣明、只消多加練習、自有可觀的成續、</p>

<h3 id="c52">所望於副刊投稿者的 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 尚卿</p>
<p>副刊編者所負的責任重大，我們已經知道了。但是一個副刊的成立，决不能單靠編者一個人，還須投稿者給他稿子，並且編者的主張，他往往要爲投稿者所左右，編者到底不能一意孤行，剛愎自用，光桿的編者，包辦一個副刊，或者至多約二三知己，自己敵鑼自己唱戲，原也有的，但是這是不正當者，並且也不是常見之事，當然不足爲訓。</p>
<p>於此，可見對於一個副刊，投稿者的重要，似乎在編者之上，而我旣已有所希望於編者了，也就不能不有所希望於這些投稿者。</p>
<p>我希望他們會選擇要投的副刊，勿亂投。副刊是多的，彼此的內容和性質，當然也有相差無幾的，然而相差很遠，或和你的主張不合的，却也不少，你就不能不留心。如果因亂投而投錯了路，尤其投到落伍的，退化的，甚至反動的副刊上，雖然給你登出來，有優越的稿費，我想你一定也不見得開心吧！此外，如果你因稿費而投稿，只求其能够出來，那末，我還希望你要謹愼你的署名，不要用同一的署名，使別人猜不透你究竟是一個怎樣的作家</p>
<p>我希望他們勿跟在別人的背後跑。別人在討論甲事，你不要也去討論甲事：別人在描寫乙物，你不要也去描寫乙物。你的題材總要憂憂獨造，簇簇生新，切勿人云亦云。作些老生常談。</p>
<p>我相信宇宙之大，人間事物之衆，可以作爲文章的題材，供我筆頭驅遣的，正也不知有多少，所謂取之不盡，用之不竭，正可以作這個解釋。只要你肯隨時隨地留心，養成敏銳的觀察力，我保證你，新穎的題材，可以俯拾卽是。（不過又不可好奇太過，走入牛角尖裏去。）</p>
<p>我希望他們勿迎合編者的心理。投稿者迎合編者的心理，恐怕是最普遍的現象吧。有些投稿者，似乎並不去研究自身稿子的精進，却一味在研究編者的嗜好。這是不對的。方才我已經說過，投稿者是可以左右編者的主張的，只要你的稿子好，內容及外表都好，雖然你沒有恰恰迎合着編者的嗜好，我相信一個存心公芷，而又事理明達的編者、决不會埋沒你的苦心的，那時你反可以一鳴驚人。不過編者的主張確乎是對的，當然投稿者，也不能就此不問，還該用種種巧妙的文筆，予以發揚光大才是。</p>
<p>我希望他們會顧到環境。我說這話自然只適用於目前本地的投稿者，因爲本地有種種限制，投稿者就有顧到的必要，否則不但勞無而功，並且要碍及報紙。然而我的所謂顧到，用意却並不如此消極，適得其反，我是說要積極的顧到。我們總不要忘記目前的重任，抗戰建國，我們要盡我們文人的職責，在各種題目上，用各種手法，寫出一致的文章，推動抗戰建國的運動。我深信文人之筆的確是無所不能的，特殊惡劣的環境的壓迫，决不能阻止特殊積極的文章的產生！</p>
<p>除了這些希望以外，當然我還希望每一個投稿者，勿寫無聊的文字，攻訐的文字，以及任何損人而不利己或者竟也損己的文字。這些我想正當的投稿者，一定是十分知道的，用不着我的辭費。</p>
<p>可是我以上的話，是對於一個已經成熟的投稿者說的，所謂已成熟者，就是他的思想見解，以及寫作技術都已經在水平線以上的意思，如果對於一個未成熱的投稿者，換言之就是思想，見解，或寫作技術，還有一項很幼稚的投稿者，我却另有我的希望。</p>
<p>我希這樣的投稿者，馬上就會停止投稿！我當然知道他們的興趣，或者他們的自負。然而在這全國同胞救國不遑的時候，據我看，量好人人能夠用得其長，直接致力於救國事業上。你在投稿上旣無把握，何必浪費精神與物力呢？你的興趣與自負，也儘可以留待到勝利之後，天下太平了，來慢慢地予以滿足。至於有些未成熱的投稿者，爲了稿子不登，或者怨天尤人，怪編者的瞎眼，私心，或者輾轉請託，以求在報端漏一漏臉，我認爲尤其要不得，希望他們在馬上停止以外，還肯痛自懺悔！</p>
<p>我這樣的希望，也許一般的投稿者要覺得不滿意，說我有意對不起他們呢。我希望他們會鑒納我的誠心：我除了希望他們有正當的，卓越的發展以外，沒有別的用意。况且我自己也就是一個投稿者，我正在將這些希望來勉勵我自己！</p>

<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事——</p>
<p>『呀，好久不見你了；你怎麼今天又會來的？』茶樓上的李金根，一看見老奶奶就這樣喊了出來。</p>
<p>老奶奶還是那一個樣子，臂灣裏換着淺沿的籃子，在賣豆。</p>
<p>『上次豆賣完了，就囘到家裏去取；不料正要再來時，便聽說鎭上有些不太平，一直嚇着不敢來，直到現在，打聽得已經沒有什麼了，所以才再來做生意。』</p>
<p>『不但不太平，差不多迎我的命都送了！』李金根慨然說，</p>
<p>他有着一般鄕下農人的共同習氣，喜歡將自己所遇到的事情，尤其危險事情，形容得過份些。據他說，那天晚上攻進公大　行來時，他從後門溜出來，在像雨點一般的槍彈下，爬了許多路，才算逃得了性命，不過，他說，他的大腿上，却已吃了一粒槍彈，到如今走路還不大便當。</p>
<p>他說着，就將彈管拉起了指給老奶奶看，果然，在他的左腿上，還有綳帶綁着，不過到底不曉得是受的什麼傷。</p>
<p>『要不是「他們」明天趕緊給我醫治，恐怕我這條腿已經不中用了。「他們」待人到底是好的。』</p>
<p>老奶奶笑笑說，『是的竟會這樣的。』</p>
<p>這時，茶樓上的茶客，有些早已知道李金根的故事，聽了李金根的話，他沒有什麼表示。但有些是今天第一次來這裏喝茶的，聽見了就不免過來看看，各自發着一些言論。</p>
<p>李金根還在滔滔不絕地談着那天晚上的事情，不但說得有如茶如火之觀，使人好像目擊其事，還夾着許多「他們」好，「他們」怎樣怎樣的話。</p>
<p>『請你吃些黃沙豆補補吧』老奶奶看見他說得不停，就從籃子裏撈了一把放到桌子上。「這是叫化子蓮心，是補受傷的人，」</p>
<p>「呀，我倒忘了，我還欠你豆錢呢？」李金根一看見是豆就說。『該多少。今天一總給你。』</p>
<p>『哈哈，』老奶奶大笑說，『你忘了豆錢，我還忘了你的鞋子呢！』</p>
<p>『前幾天我到李家橋去過的，到了你的家裏。你的妻子說，你帶囘去的錢她收到的，她知道我還要到這裏來賣豆。看得見你，所以叫我帶了一雙鞋子給你。』</p>
<p>『那末鞋子呢？』</p>
<h3 id="c54">「地獄之門」 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 曾兆筠</p>
<p>金正氣沒有「官」做，屈指算來又是十八年了。這一大段悠長難過的行程，使他底又凹又毛的肚子脹飽了『懷才不遇』的憤慨—他時常拿了蒲扇，坐到金家祠的大門，右足蹺在左足上，口沬橫飛的大罵不重斯文的政府如何稽糕；如何沒用。或者——用蒲扇柄痛擊大地的肚皮，高唱『才高庸主棄，節挺故人疏！』一類的戲文。</p>
<p>自從本年二月，金正氣的故鄉——唐縣淪陷以後，他因時勢變遷交上官運，他已不再到祠堂門口唱京調了，從廿二那天起，更每日到一間被炮火轟去了一角的平房辦公，這個地方正是從前縣政府的舊址。</p>
<p>眞有有點得意忘形了，幾天來的快活情緒，替代了十多年的鬱抑，他笑迷迷的坐在靠手椅上，左脚仍是蹺緊右脚很適意地顫動，黑漆漆的桌子面前貼上一張他親筆繕寫尺來長的大紅紙條，端端正正嵌上『庶務主任席』五個黑得發紫的字，下面還加上一個挺大的『感嘆符號』。</p>
<p>但，快樂是不會長久的，跟住來的煩惱多著哩。</p>
<p>一天，一個相貌威嚴的武裝軍官，到維持會來了，他摸著小鬍子，輕輕地問：</p>
<p>『那個是金庶務？』</p>
<p>『就是在下。』一個九十度的鞠躬，他的『節』並不怎樣『挺』。</p>
<p>『就是你？』軍官對他翻一翻白眼。聲音放粗一點，『聽着！明兒上午八時以前，送五十個花姑娘到軍部去『用』！都要上等貨色，明白了沒有？』</p>
<p>『報吿官長，敝縣的花姑娘差不多都跑光了，五十個斷定是找不到的，而且——』</p>
<p>『放屁！』焦雷似的吼聲，截短了他的話，『眞是個沒用東西，明天若不準時送來，小心你的狗命！我是話是和鑽石一樣硬的！』那軍官一口氣說完！『刷』的一轉身，大踏步的走了，他的足音很重，一下一下打進金正氣的心坎。</p>
<p>『唉！沒官做難，但做起來更不易呀！』金正氣慢慢的走囘辦公室，四顧似乎沒有人，低低的嘆了一句。</p>
<p>『哈……哈！你旣曉得作『官』難，那末你來幹嗎？』放縱的笑聲把他嚇了一大跳，扭轉頭一看。說話的正是同室辦公的文牘員古木天。</p>
<p>『哈哈！那你又爲什麼來？』金正氣不自然地搭訕著。</p>
<p>『我？唉！你還不知道我，我是被槍口迫着幹的，不是我自己廿心情願的！不瞞你說，我是從上海逃來的雌民，跑到這裏滿以爲可以安心做事，想不到一星期過後，我們的軍隊便退却了。我遲走一步，被他們捉到這裏，寫這些抹煞良心的佈吿，爲了性侖叫做沒有法子，眞是『從人簷下過，那得不頭低』。</p>
<p>『喂！放低聲點，這些話給人聽去不是玩的，我和你商量商量，今天聯隊長吩咐我在明見上午八時送五十條女人到軍部，像這廢墟一樣的地方，一時那裏去找，古先生，你肯幫我點忙麼？』</p>
<p>『別的可以，這件事我對不起，記得前天晚上，我在福來品茗，竟混進十多個游擊隊，他們站起來演說，勸大家不要把自己親愛的姊妹，送給窮凶極惡的敵人！』古木天說完便說聲『再見』　了。</p>
<p>第二天，金正氣縛了十二個菜靑臉色的婦女到軍部交貨，出門的時候，兩頰還帶上紅一塊紮一塊的巴掌印，從此以後，他便很恨他的主人，覺到古木天的話很不錯，他倆便成爲很好的朋友。</p>
<p>一個晚上。</p>
<p>朔風怒擊林木，天空沒有月亮，也沒有星星，泥土的胸脯被黑暗壓着，周遭寂靜得怕人，只聽得一條河水，在低低地呻吟着。</p>
<p>唐縣的　角，一陣緊密的槍聲過後，便動盪起一股雄壯的歌聲——『起來！不願做奴隸的人們！』把黑暗的天幕都衝破了，</p>
<p>治安維持會旁邊，一條小胡同裏站立着兩個人影，手是互租握着，一個說：</p>
<p>『金大哥，時候已到，我要去歸隊了！希望你能早日來，我們便可重在一起。』另一個說：</p>
<p>『木大！你去吧，撲到自已人的懷抱裏去吧！那褽是天堂——有陽光；有春天。唉！我，我還敲着「地獄之門」哩！』</p>
<h3 id="c55">從成都到西安 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>四、蜀道難</p>
<p>車字像爬虫一樣，慢慢地在爬動着，每一個乘客都起着歇斯的里性的心理變態，沉湎在危險與安全的幻覺裏。我腦筋裏突如記起了是唐詩中的詩句：『蜀道難。難於上天靑！』</p>
<p>如今我自己走在這「難于上靑天」的蜀道上，才眞正體味到這幾句詩的實感。據說，現代科學發達，開闢公路，利用汽車行走，還可以在幾個鐘頭內爬過了它；從前步行，走半個月一個月都爬不過。那麼，這「蜀道難，蜀道難」的難路究竟是在那裏呢？不是別的，正是西秦第一關！</p>
<p>五、寕羌一宿</p>
<p>下午三時半車到了寧羗，因爲路不好走，趕漢中恐怕趕不到，遂决定停宿于此。</p>
<p>寧羌縣城較緜陽，廣元爲大，爲「繁榮」；我下了車，拖着一身的疲勞，和坐在車上不能伸屈而痳痺了的兩足，携着行李一拐一拐的往街上找旅館去。隨着雨後路上的泥濘，定了約五分鐘，在一家木造平房門口發見了「寧康旅社」的紅紙招牌。我的靈魂被它吸引住了，一徑往它那裏走去。我的腦子裏有了成見，反正在這樣的地方不會有好旅館，而自己又這麼的疲勞，只要找到一個地方歇歇是了。我踏進了大門，拐進了中廳，站在天井的石階上一看，倒是兩層樓的木造房子，很整齊，漆油得非常新　奪目，登時給我疲憊的心靈以無限的快感，我問茶房有沒有空房子，他說有，我便决意住在這裏了。他帶我爬上了二樓，穿過中廳的走廊，跨過一扇圓門，進了後廳，他開了兩邊的兩個房子的門謙恭地對我說道：</p>
<p>『先生！這是最好的房子了。』</p>
<p>我決定住右邊的一個。茶房給我把行李搬進去了。</p>
<p>房子約有一丈五尺見方的寬大，像私爲兩張木床，一張八仙桌，一張長方小桌、兩張圓凳子。一個衣架，床上的棉被，也還乾凈，又有兩個小窻通空氣，這與綿陽，廣元的像茅坑一樣的客棧相比較，那簡直可以說是有天淵之別了。</p>
<p>房子四邊爲板壁，油的白漆，過客們在板壁題了許多詩，茲　錄數首于後：</p>
<p>一成都到此路不平</p>
<p>千山萬壑起蒼窮；</p>
<p>神馳電掣無停住；</p>
<p>西蜀風雲一路中。」</p>
<p>這一首是描寫從成都到這裏這一段路上的風景，但不够具體和深刻。</p>
<p>「戎州來此里還千，</p>
<p>振興國魂赴長安；</p>
<p>掃盡倭跡方息恨，</p>
<p>否則寧死不生還！」</p>

<p>誰都知道戲劇在抗戰中的作用但這一定要依存於藝術形式充分的利用，用成熟的　　　　　　　正　的主　　在抗戰的現　　　，　　　　　　　　　　對　　　　　　　　　　的作用止是不容忽視的，我們熱誠的戲劇同　却正是不爲　視的一羣，他們把　治　　術融合，貫　，把它成一種不可屈撓的力量、到處激動民衆，　　民衆，充分表現了他們的戰門性，這在內地及香港各劇團的每次義演的成績，都可以看得到，今明十六·十七兩日由留港的中旅·中藝·中救三劇圑在利舞合的聯合義演「黎明之前」上更可以看得到，如果以前各劇團的義演是力的單位，　電次聯合　演　是　的　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　生　　　　，在這精神總動員加緊推行的現在，一定會起很大的作用，而收最大的效果的·我們在此誠懇預祝若</p>
<p>更有的，就是這三個劇團在義演後，便向內地或國外各上征途去負起自己的任務。這樣看來，他們自已——劇作者——正像一口銳利的針，穿上一條鋼戰般的線（戲劇）。走　天下的去把每</p>
<p>一個中國的心都給連結起來，爲祖國而奮鬥！所以，我們又可以說，這次聯合義演，是劇作者連結大衆，而把戲劇交給大衆，把精神交給祖國的一個力的組合的表　。我們謹向他們致敬！</p>
<p>這里必須提及的就是「黎明之前」，這個劇他內分四個優秀的獨立的戲，這四個戲，又是抗戰後二十多個月來最精粹最優秀的代表劇作、內容都是描寫黎明將要到來之前的可歌可泣的故事。這四個戲，雖然有不同的體裁，不同表演，但都有一個很明白的主題，就是用極藝術的手法，表現一個全國全民族的要求——『有錢出錢，有力出力』！</p>
<p>這四個戲中，有兩個戲的主題，是接觸到献金的，一個是中救上次公演時使許多人深深感動的「賊」字一個是新排的『贖罪』，勸人把死藏的不用的東西和財物獻給在苦鬥中的祖國，這兩個戲的主顯雖然差不多，但去埔寫手法上却有兩種不同的滋味，此外，歐陽予倩先生編導的「曙光」也是用一個「有力出力」的動人事實，來反襯出「有錢不出錢」的人物的　態，「賣藝者」則是以一個悲慘的遭遇來感動觀衆，使大家警惕猛省，立定脚跟來突破目前的因難</p>
<p>參加這次　合公演的人物，都是留港的——亦是全國的——最負盛譽的第一流戲劇工作者，導演是歐陽予倩先生金山先生，出演劇人（以姓氏筆劃多少爲序）有王瑩，李景波，李丹露，金山，金黎，姜，唐槐秋，唐若靑，唐若英，柯剛，范政，孫兆新，秦小竹，張立德，童毅，黃河，楊薇，鄧竹筠，葛鑫，　　梅，蕭子英，蘇繪等，這一批最優秀的劇人，在香港的觀衆面前當已不會陌生，是不待我們介紹的，至這次公演中，舞台裝置，燈光，服裝，道具，效果……担任的人，亦都各該團體經騐豐當的工作者，現在冶精萃於一爐是，其完善與偉大，自是不待言的。</p>
<p>我們相信，這一次的演出，一定能給香港的觀衆知道目前戲劇的最高峯頂的形態，一定能更進一步的算定話劇新階段基礎的，爲了　實現階段最高度的戲劇藝術，爲了領略在黎明將要到來的鬥爭形態，我們是千萬不要過這個機會的。而且，這次聯合公演，籌款所得，將全數撥捐國內文化事業的善舉，這更是愛祖國愛戲劇僑胞們，所更應該盡力贊助的。（幼綵）</p>

<h3 id="c71">星期日在上海 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 廷康</p>
<p>平日南京路在早上八九點鐘光景顯得是車水馬龍、每一輛東行的公共汽車或電車裏都擠滿了人，大小職員這時都匆地奔向自己的辦公處。然而星期日　上有點異樣，每輛車箱　都很空洞、通候在車站上　售晨報的報童、也喊得不大起勁、因爲星期日大家公認爲休息的一天，一週來的辛苦、希望在這天上得到調節的酬報。</p>
<p>然而休息在上海人的意義也就是「白相」，到禮拜六下了辦公室碰到同事，就會問：「明朝地方去白招？『可見星期日就成爲』白相」的日子，而各樣的上海人便有各式的白相地方。</p>
<p>第一我要說的，倒不是屬於『白相』方面，祗要看上海有這許多尖塔屋頂的黃色敎堂、就可知基督敎在上海的潜力，這些敎堂在星期日是極活躍的地方，那些善男信女、不顧天大的事情、那天一定要虔誠地到敎堂裏去做禱吿、聽牧師宣揚一番敎義、才放得下心、因爲這個儀式、也許是包括六天來的懺悔和改過。</p>
<p>美國駐滬第四海軍部，每星期日早上十點也假大上海戲院舉行禱吿禮拜，參加的極擁擠、有高等華人、學生，中級商人等等，其中大部份恐怕倒是『醉翁之意不在酒，』因爲海軍部在禱吿　完後、　有一個鐘點的音樂和歌唱、而玩意也着實不錯、這樣免費的享受、足使不信敎的也願進去坐二小時，除此以外、或許還有其他目的的恕我不知其詳了、</p>
<p>上海有五十家電影院，六家。　館，在星期日沒有不吿客滿的、這裏顧客是包含有紳士，學生以及小市民層：囘力球場跑狗場的人頭蠢動着，這裏沉　了不少熱中的人，中十幾個雙獨贏將比每天跑辦公處要來得舒服；邀　個朋友上茶室作淸談，自世界大勢張　倫在羅馬患傷風談至隔壁王家小貓失蹤，一面又可嚼那自己喜歡的各式點心，自然也是得其所哉的樂事；假使是個好天氣，那末很冬背個鏡箱上公園的雖然軟片價目已飛漲得可怕，而公園也成爲高等難民的收容所，可是公國　究竟是有　有木有草堆的去處。</p>
<p>文化街已是消沉得可憐，不過在這天也仍有人趁此餘暇立歡來往　覽瀏覽，同樣在作　覽工作的，是一些女太太和孩子，然而地點却是在幾家有名的百貨大公司，他們食婪地從這裏看到那裏，再從那裏看到這裏，恨不得把心愛的　統帶囘去才好，其實手裏的紙包已經是不能再多拿了。</p>
<p>舞場酒樓　這天總是擁擠得好像希望客人不要光顧了，但客人好像愈擁擠愈有味兒的源源而來，午餐　不到十二點鐘已在開始，而花彫卽使是一元錢一斤也還有人喝。</p>
<p>有的在消遣，有的在陶醉，然而也有人　所事事，我一眼就看到第二個：隔壁看門的王金標、他仍是蠢蠢的獃坐在門旁的長凳上，星期日他也無動于中；對過單開間門面雜貨舖子的那小伙子也仍是楞着一對眼珠子呆看馬路上的行人，車輛……</p>
<h3 id="c72">上海夜報漫談 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>雖然上海是世界上的第六大商埠，　有三百五十萬之衆的市民，而同時，更是處於全國經濟，文化等等中心的地位，然而說起來很慚愧，夜報在上海的歷史，却是還只有短短的十五年。</p>
<p>夜報與上海人相見的最早的一種，就我個人的記憶所及，似乎是在民國十三年在江浙二大軍閥所演出的所誚齊盧戰爭的爆發之後，那時的夜報，是叫做『東南晚報』。</p>
<p>本來上海人的看報，在那時：第一是看戲館的廣吿　就是刊登戲館廣吿的那一版所謂「戲報』。看完戲報，第二，挨到看本埠新聞。看本埠新聞之目的。是在夾縫之中，努力的尋找富有桃色風味的『社會新聞』。於是翻開鴛　胡蝶派的附刊來，讀讀滑稽文章，言情小說，最後方檢出正張來，瞧着國內外大事的標題，自然商人們對於經濟新聞版，是感着相當興味的，主婦們，或許是以一切商店的『大減價』廣吿爲興味之中心的。各種人，都有各種人愛讀的資料，但是對於國內大局，及國際大勢的漠不關心，十五年前，是上海一般讀報者中的再也普遍不過的現象。</p>
<p>以上所述的，是在十五年前一般早報在上海社會之間的地位。早報尙且如此，夜報的命運，自然更是可想而知。再加着上海人在那時，是沒有購讀夜報之習慣，而齊盧戰爭，又在上海的租界之外。旣沒有大砲的怒吼，更沒有飛機的高翔，「精彩」的報道，是沒有的，所以在經過了短短的一個過程之後，夜報是完全與上海絕緣了。</p>
<p>在那時，上海的一般兒童，對於東南報晚會有一個很遍普的童謠，在街頭巷尾歌唱……『東南夜報，夜飯吃飽，本錢不到，就要睡覺』。意謂叫賣夜報，是僅只能在晚飯之後撑點場面，撈上幾個大錢，晚飯一過，牧場大吉，睡覺去也。</p>
<p>之後，一直到民國二十年，在東北，發生了『九一八』之變，時局變化，瞬息萬變。而在那時，上海人旣歷過了一次革命的過程，也居然認識了國事與國民之間的關係，於是絕迹了六七年的所謂「夜報」，應一般市民的需求，而重行在上海作第二次出現。但是在那時的夜報，都是上海原有的幾家報紙所發　的，所以一般叫作「號外」。待到繼一九一八」而起的「一二八」戰事宣吿暫時的結束以後，一般的「號外」，　改組而爲「夜報」。但是時事旣沒有强大的刺激力，夜報上旣沒有可資號召的時事報道的資料，於是上海人對於夜報，又逐漸地問鼎者漸少，不過這一次，雖然一般的夜報，未能抓住，或是擁有廣大的讀者，可是夜報在上海，却總算奠定了一個相當的基礎。</p>
<p>民國二十六年，『七七」事件之勃發，接着「八一三」的全面抗戰是開始了，在這大時代的展開中，各種「夜報」在上海，是成了一個滿街飛。雖然一份夜報的批價，僅僅是十五文至二十五文，然而在風頭最健的日子，夜報一張，在買夜報的實子手中，竟可摻得到六分至一角的代價。自大上海完全淪陷之後，夜報是一天多似一天，而讀者的興味，却是成爲反比例的，在一天天的低降着。所以到了最近，雖是第一流的夜報，在晚上八時以後，是僅値一分大洋了。不過在刊登了『特別好消息』的日子，却還是很受上海人的飲迎，而競以先睹爲快。雖臨時漲價至每份三分，也還是很易脫手。</p>
<h3 id="c73">南京路在轉變中 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 洪濤</p>
<p>南京路本來是租界的中心可是現在是整個上海的中心了，孤島的上海現象可從南京路上推見她的全貌。南京路在這短短一年餘的時間中，有不少的遞變。八一三戰事初起時，南京路的凄凉，和今日底終日熙熙攘攘，眞是意想不到的兩個極端的情形，這遞變，是南京　的興衰史上最特殊的一頁。</p>
<p>南京路在戰前，固然也是最繁盛的所在，但這繁盛，僅僅是它所處地位上所有的一點浮貌，它的內在實也掩飾不了瀰漫着的不最氣、商店的無綫電以及大減價的旗幟和吹號打鼓，只是點級着生氣，上午中午黃昏三次上班散値的時間顯得有些喧　，其餘的時間，雖然路上行人不絕，但商店的營業並不是一槪都很興旺的，泰　，寗波實業銀行，大盛福，大滬銀行那幾幢模樣不錯的巨廈都空關着但現在的情形，絕端不同了，人是自晨至暮的擠攘不絕，並不長的一條馬路上，新的商店不知增設了多少家，上而說的幾處巨廈，現在都已另有新主，煥然改觀，泰豐原址，現在是裘天寳銀樓（南京路上現在有二爿裘天寳了，原在老九綸對過的一爿是支店，總店前在小東門。）甯波實業銀行原址，現爲大昌綢緞莊，大盛福原址今爲中華國貨公司，虹廟對過的一幢房子，戰前爲上海國貨公司。×××的各項事業倒掉，這幢房子也就空關起來，戰後闢作難民收容所，房屋更毀圯不堪，可是現在又變成了一所水泥門面的新廈了，它的新主就是重囘南京路的方九霞銀樓。大滬銀行的大滬大樓現已改爲新大祥大樓，信大祥那輝煌的門面，也爲南京路增添了無限熱鬧。</p>
<p>南京路上現在新開的店舖，以綢緞店銀樓，藥店，參燕號爲最多，其中藥店乃北地風光，店舖的餘者，十九是小東門轉移過來的。</p>
<p>現在南京路上四大公司中兩大公司，其門面都已改造過先改造者爲新新，時在前歲之末，那香港式的走廊改換了，就原地位改建櫉窗，舖面的開牆改爲乳黃大理石，但也許那建築不大考究，僅僅不久時間，那色澤望上去已有點黯然無光了，後改者爲先施，也把底層面牆改爲淡黃大理石，到現在似乎還未全部竣工，而先施全部玻璃遮廊，也都改爲水泥的，這諒因以前的鐵架，受炸彈炸戀的影嚮，不能全部改直，所以只能水泥來包掩了。</p>
<p>先施的炸彈傷痕，似乎完全沒有影蹤了，但筆者却發見一個永不能滅的破綻，就是先施二樓凉合上換去的二根盤龍鐵柱，其盤龍姿勢與原有的適相反，原有的是向上盤的，現換的是向下盤的，這也許是工人的一時疏忽，但這眞可爲這創傷留下一個娘跡，日後如有人修南京路的掌故，這倒是南京路的大事記之一。</p>
<p>據個中人說，現在上海依叫賣夜報爲生的苦孩子和失業者，約在一千至一千五百人之間，他們每天收入，自二角全半元不等。他們大半都是給砲火燬滅了家的人們，但是他們現在的生活，却還是靠若戰爭而維持。因爲若是一旦戰爭宜吿了結束，上海人又將忘却了夜報，到那時，賣夜報者，自然不容易在此尋求其生活了。但是莫瞧他們是僅僅叫賣夜報的苦人兒，他們却也都具有着普通的「抗戰勝利，乃有飯吃」的意識。</p>
<h3 id="c74">飯店弄堂 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>在十里洋場的上海，一般窮措大要解决衣食住行四大問題，的確是件難事，單以『食』一項而論，馬路上雖然開設着許多大酒館，可是『京菜』『粵食』的金字招牌只是允許有錢階級去幸受，在這迫切的需要下、飯店弄堂是應運而生了，而一直保持著他那昌盛熱鬧的情形。</p>
<p>許多人或者要疑惑『飯店弄堂』這名詞的來源，我亦曾問過一位七十多歲的『老上海」他吿我說，他初到上海時飯店弄堂巳經有點雛形了，這樣說來，飯店弄堂長久歷史是造成他今日的規模，而他的確已到了黃金時代。</p>
<p>飯店弄堂就是南京路慈昌里的通稱，這是一條舊式的弄堂，除通南京路之外西面亦通江西路，在東面的四川路亦有着兩個出口，因爲弄堂裏大部份都是開設小飯館小麵館，所以就給大家所熟悉，而靠着牠「價廉物美」的經營，吸引了無數的顧客，裏面有廣東菜的飯店，有本地的小酒店，囘敎的淸眞館，專售麵食的『排骨麵大王』，西洋風味的咖啡麵包店，露天的『平民果腹處』，一天到晚烘大餅油條，的麵舖，供人狼吞虎嚥的年糕攤子……無論那一種人到裏面都會找到他的嗜好飲食，無無論那一種人都會覺得到滿意低廉的代價換到足够的飲食，這眞是最「樂會』的事件了。</p>
<p>洋行的小職員、學生、工人、印度人、巡捕、窮困潦倒的白俄、討飯的乞丐，都是這裏的老主顧、這萬有皮大衣高跟鞋燙髪的大學女生、有西裝革履的「花花公子」，到中午的時候都不約而同的擁了進來，而一批批的吃完了就走，讓候補　坐下釆，解决這大問題。假使天晴的話，露天裏還設『雅座』，整個的弄堂擠滿了人，那一角還有許多席地而食的工人，白飯之外加三十鈿的靑菜解决了餓的問題，乞丐在飯店鬥口着花一個銅板買來的魚骨頭，剩飯，白俄在咖啡店裏用不純熟筷子吃菜，印度人在吃着硬麵包，大家爲着要『活』，都拚命把肚子塞滿。</p>
<p>普通花兩毛錢到裏面去已吃得很飽經濟飯是兩毛，陽春麵五分白飯六十文一碗、荳腐湯兩百六十文、貴族化一點花三毫錢已是吃得不亦樂乎、此外鬥口有賣橘子的攤子、花三分錢買一隻天合山蜜橘、一路走一路吃囘去、眞使人覺得有點陶陶然</p>
<p>飯店弄堂是給人歌頌，在這米珠薪桂的時代，他的確是窮人階級的好伴侶，雖然裏面是光綫暗淡，空氣汚濁，萬萬及不上大飯店的百尺高樓的風光，可是同樣給人以滿足的享受，他的成名，他的繁盛，當然不是偶然的了。</p>

<p>在上海馬路上行駛的汽車必須有一張『照會』，這是誰都知道的，到最近領出來的汽車『照會』，號碼一定超出一萬號以上，也就可知道，上海至少有一萬輛汽車，其中包括自備汽車和出租客車，以及自備運輸車和出租運輸車，自備汽車和出租客車的分別在『照會』上可以看出來，前者是黑底白宇，後者是白底黑字，至於運輸汽車的分別是自備者也係黑底白字，而出租者則爲黃底白宇。</p>
<p>我們每天在馬路上所見到的汽車的號碼，有十，百千，萬，以外或以內，但是掛一號碼『照會』的汽車，我們就從來沒有看見過，那末一號照會有沒有呢？有的！據說照會的主人姓周，這一張一號照會的發遠在民國初年，可知這家姓周的以前就很富有，當然這一張最早的一號照會祗有一張，决不會有第二張出來，所以它很可貴，它的主人也把它視同奇寳，以爲很有面子，可是掛這張一號照會的汽車巳經是一部老爺汽車』了，所以現在一直放在汽車間里不出來，這『老爺汽車』的主人翁為了要保有一號照會的緣故，月季捐從來沒有間斷過，否則，這張一號照會會被車務處吊銷的。</p>
<p>汽車不隨便什麼人可以駕駛的，開汽車的都有一張司機執照，這種司機執照必須經過二度嚴格的考試及格後，方能領出，現在司機執照已發到二萬多號，據說考得第一號司機執照的綽號叫小梅郞，姓名則無從探悉，小梅郞早已去世了，他生前曾在猶太富　哈同氏家里開汽車，其時，還有一段和一號汽車照會的故事：</p>
<p>哈同因爲僅有一號司機面無一號汽車，所以曾託人向周家說項，願出重資購買他家的一號汽車　會，姓周的很幽默的囘答說：「哈同要一號汽車照會，因爲他有一號車夫，預備有兩個一號；而我們有一號汽車照會，哈同那里旣然有一號車夫，那末我們情願出特別的工錢要一個一號司機……』結果當然使哈同氏遺恨地下。在上海，在汽車照會上打主意的，也是一般的現象了，如同樣字位，或聯號，這大概是所謂『裝飾美』吧？而同時，也確有一部份人以坐汽車作爲『裝飾美』的，實際却是『空心大佬官』。</p>

<h3 id="e1">A New Stage in the Far Eastern International Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Tianjin Japanese military police, beginning on the morning of the 14th of this month, blockaded the British and French concessions, coercing the British and French authorities to accept their unreasonable demands. The seriousness of this situation cannot simply be regarded as a "reproduction" of the Gulangyu landing incident, but it also concerns the entire existence of European and American powers in the Far East. If Britain and France once again show submission to Japan and accept unreasonable demands, then Japan's aggressive ambitions to encroach on the Far Eastern interests of the powers will become even more rampant, and not only will China's door be completely closed, but the entire Asia will also become Japan's sole sphere of dominance, thereby realizing the "conquest of the world" in Tanaka Giichi's memorial!</p>
<p>However, Japan's recent brutal behavior should not be seen as a "provocation" against the European and American powers, but rather as a political and diplomatic offensive, a conspiracy to rescue itself from the difficulties it has encountered in its military invasion of China. As the London Daily Telegraph stated on the 14th: "Japan has repeatedly created incidents, seemingly with a fixed purpose. The reason for this is that Japan's attempt to conquer China is progressing slowly. Not only does Japan know this, but the Chinese also know it. In order to save face, Japan does not hesitate to arbitrarily destroy the interests of third countries as a means. This should not be regarded as Japan's strength, but rather as Japan's weakness and incompetence."</p>
<p>It is precisely because the foundation of the Japanese's violence lies in its own "weakness and incompetence," that even in these speculative, opportunistic, risky, and intimidating actions, it constantly and everywhere demonstrates its strategy of avoiding strength and attacking weakness: It provokes Outer Mongolia, but when Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov mentioned in his diplomatic speech that "the Soviet Union's determination to defend Outer Mongolia is no different from the Soviet border," Japan immediately lowered its flag, silenced its drums, and quietly retreated; it provokes the European and American powers, such as the Gulangyu incident and the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, but its target is concentrated on the most easily compromised Britain, while expressing that it has no hostility toward the United States.</p>
<p>Although Japan's conspiracy has become a universally seen fact. At present, the British people and national public opinion have enthusiastically and unanimously demanded a tough stance against Japan, and the United States and France have also clearly expressed their willingness to cooperate effectively in dealing with the Far Eastern incident. The Soviet Union was the first to call on Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly aid China, and insisted in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations that the anti-aggression front should include the Far East. We Chinese, have also factually demonstrated that not only can we defend our country's survival and independence through resistance, but we have also been resisting the common enemy for the sake of Britain, the United States, and France for almost two years! The current question is: Are Britain, the United States, and France willing to succumb to Japan's speculative, opportunistic, risky, and intimidating actions, and withdraw from China and the Far East one after another? Or will they take collective action to give Japan an appropriate and necessary lesson, and obtain honorable and genuine peace? The former is destruction, while the latter is the only way out.</p>
<p>At present, China and the Soviet Union go without saying, the United States, France, and other countries are also striving to promote all countries to embark on the path of aiding China and containing Japan. According to a telegram on the 14th, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee has unanimously passed a partial amendment to the Neutrality Act, abolishing the arms embargo, and the State Department unanimously advocated actively promoting anti-aggression actions when reviewing its Far Eastern policy. The same day's telegram also stated that Anglo-French cooperation is about to extend to the Far East, and the two countries' Far Eastern military leaders have left for Singapore today to hold a military conference to discuss the implementation of Far Eastern military cooperation. In addition, it is rumored that the Soviet fleet will also hold a large-scale Pacific exercise within days.</p>
<p>China's heroic resistance over the past two years has exposed the Japanese aggressors' "weakness and incompetence" and has greatly changed the international situation, and anti-aggression actions have, in fact, gradually expanded to the Far East as mentioned above! Let the Tianjin incident completely shatter the democratic countries' policy of compromise! Let the Tianjin incident serve as the basis for establishing an anti-aggression front in the Far East! Let the Japanese aggressors use the action of blockading the Tianjin concessions to dig their own graves!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Guidance Methods for Wartime Education <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Zeming</p>
<p>(1) Cultivating New Morality in Students</p>
<p>The new morality we are talking about refers to the various good qualities that anti-Japanese warriors should possess and the various good qualities that builders of the Three Principles of the People's New China should possess. Anti-Japanese warriors and builders of the New China must have a sound national consciousness and a spirit of collectivism. It is not enough to have this consciousness and spirit; they must also have the various qualities of fighting for national and collective interests, not fearing sacrifice, and being mutually helpful and autonomous.</p>
<p>The old moral education can be divided into two aspects. One aspect is that it ignored politics, or it can be said that it was detached from politics, and only considered morality. It was believed that moral education alone, cultivating each person's public and private virtues very well, could make China revive. The other aspect is that this kind of "moral education" actually represented the political ideology of the ruling class, but it deliberately concealed its own political face, not letting others know its true purpose. For example, many schools (in the occupied areas) opened under the direction of Japanese imperialism, studying the Five Classics and Four Books, which was clearly manufacturing slaves in order to achieve its long-term rule over China, but it was still promoting "seeking happiness for the Chinese people"? It was still propagating that it "has no political purpose"?</p>
<p>For these old moral educations, we must mercilessly expose its true face, widely disseminate its sins, and give it a fatal blow so that it cannot continue to exist. The cultivation of the new morality of the anti-Japanese education does not conceal its own political face, but rather selects the most correct political requirements as its guidance goals.</p>
<p>(2) Past Moral Education Only Focused on Bookish and Verbal Guidance</p>
<p>Talking about morality on paper, explaining it logically and systematically, but unfortunately it was just talking and saying. The people who said it were unwilling to do it themselves, and the people who listened were just listening. In the past, principals, professors, and teachers always liked to say "brightness, uprightness, grandeur, and beauty" to students, but they themselves were doing all kinds of improper things; in the past, officials and masters always said good and beautiful words such as "honesty, impartiality, love for the people, and responsibility," but they were accepting bribes, selling the law, and colluding with local bullies to oppress good people. How can this kind of contradiction between words and deeds make people follow them? Therefore, the past moral education was just an old, unsalable cliché.</p>
<p>The new morality needed now is not empty talk but the expression of practice, and the new morality only exists in practical action. If national consciousness is not expressed in direct or indirect anti-Japanese actions, if the spirit of collectivism is not expressed in the spirit of collectivism, if sacrifice and courage are not expressed in giving up the ego and struggling to fight for national interests and collective happiness, then so-called national consciousness, spirit of collectivism, sacrifice and struggle...etc. are all empty; new morality is only expressed in practical behavior, and only in behavior can your character be seen. The new morality that anti-Japanese education guides and cultivates is like this.</p>
<p>3. The difference between the past school guidance methods and the anti-war education misleading methods</p>
<p>In the past, schools adopted a policy of high pressure to guide students, making students unable to move or dare to move: the school authorities formulated very strict school rules, using severe punishments as a means to force students to obey, in order to cultivate students' blind obedience habits and slavishness, just like imperialism forcing the people of colonies to obey the laws promulgated by the colonial government.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese education wants to oppose the guidance method of high-pressure policy, because we do not want to be slaves to a fallen country, so we also oppose training docile people like sheep; what we need now are soldiers with initiative and autonomy, only such soldiers can defeat Japan and build a new China. Such soldiers can never be cultivated by guidance methods that adopt a high-pressure policy.</p>
<p>Some people say: "Anti-Japanese education opposes high-pressure policies, which means that students are not required to obey discipline." On the contrary, we require all aspects of students' lives to be disciplined. The discipline of life is absolutely necessary, but the method of maintaining discipline is for students to formulate their own life covenants and implement them themselves. Hold meetings and discuss; try to make this covenant understood by every student, so that every student feels that this covenant meets their own requirements, and everyone consciously and voluntarily abides by this covenant, so that the students can cultivate the habit and ability of self-awareness and autonomy.</p>
<p>With a life covenant, it still cannot be guaranteed that no one will violate the life covenant. Individual backward elements will sometimes violate it. Violators of the life covenant should be sanctioned, but this sanction is not to be carried out by a certain person or the school authorities, but by a group. Such sanctions are also different from past sanctions. Past sanctions were only passive punishments. Minor offenses were recorded, and serious offenses were expelled. Students suffered such severe punishment and did not know why. Anti-Japanese education advocates active obedience, so that the offender understands his mistakes, admits his mistakes, and resolves to correct his mistakes. The collective sanctions we advocate are not for everyone to attack him but to help him, to help him correct his mistakes and become a more active and sound anti-Japanese cadre.</p>
<p>(4) Group Competition is an Effective Method to Promote Students' Disciplined Life</p>
<p>How to conduct group competition? That is, within a certain period, overcoming a certain obvious common weakness as the goal of the competition. For example, the lives of ordinary students are more scattered now, so we should concentrate our efforts to overcome this weakness. When formulating competition covenants, we should aim at the common weaknesses of each period and hold competitions between classes and groups. Each competition unit should formulate its own competition plan. After extensive and in-depth discussions by the people participating in the competition, everyone believes that it is very appropriate, and then make a decision. After the decision, everyone should strive to complete the plan, exceed the plan, and strive for victory.</p>
<p>Group competition has two benefits. Because the competition is collective, not individual, so to win, every member of this group must be very sound, so advanced members must help backward members, and backward members must quickly catch up with advanced members, so the spirit of mutual help is greatly promoted. This is one. The competition covenant is formulated by the students themselves and implemented by the students themselves. In order to win, they must manage themselves, so they can train students' autonomy ability. This is two.</p>
<p>(5) Self-Criticism is a Weapon for Seeking Progress</p>
<p>Whether it is a group or an individual, shortcomings are inevitable in the work process. A person or a group wants to have no shortcomings, unless it does not work. The question is not whether there are shortcomings, but whether you are willing to overcome shortcomings. Don't be afraid of having shortcomings, just be afraid of not being willing to overcome shortcomings. If you have shortcomings and are willing to honestly admit them and resolve to overcome them, then you can slowly overcome the shortcomings and make yourself progress. If a person has shortcomings and overcomes them, then this person can continue to progress. One's own shortcomings are often invisible to oneself, and others need to criticize and guide them, so it is necessary to hold regular life review meetings. Life review meetings should stipulate a certain time for eating, and the work or life of each person should be reviewed in detail at the meeting. First of all, it should be self-criticism, and then mutual criticism by others. Criticism must be specific, pointing out the shortcomings, where these shortcomings are expressed, what harm these shortcomings have on the work, and how to overcome them. During the discussion, everyone should try their best to express their opinions.</p>
<p>Life review meetings can not only help a person overcome those shortcomings, but also learn lessons at this meeting. Everyone can understand these shortcomings based on the mistakes made by others, so as not to repeat these shortcomings.</p>
<p>How to ensure that the shortcomings that have been criticized can be overcome? A strict inspection system must be established, that is, the degree of implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting should be strictly checked at each meeting, whether each person has corrected the shortcomings they have admitted, and if they have not been corrected, whether there are any difficulties. If there are difficulties, specific methods to solve the difficulties should be discussed. At the same time, everyone should pay attention to helping him overcome his shortcomings in daily life.</p>
<p>Self-criticism should not only criticize shortcomings, but also promote strengths. The excellent achievements of a person or a group, the exemplary style in life and work, should also be promoted, on the one hand, to encourage the continued promotion of strengths, and at the same time to allow others to learn various strengths.</p>
<p>In short, holding review meetings at all times, reviewing the degree of implementation of the work, criticizing shortcomings and promoting strengths, can promote the progress of individuals or groups and make the work completed quickly.</p>
<p>6. The Relationship Between Teachers and Students Should be Close and Respectful</p>
<p>In the past, schools adopted high-pressure policies towards students, so in the past, students were outwardly respectful to teachers but secretly opposed them, and even openly opposed them. Teachers of anti-Japanese education should not make students afraid but should make students respect, should not make students hate but should make students love, help him correct students' mistakes; also help him promote students' strengths. This is not a laissez-faire doctrine, a package-handling doctrine, nor is it doing work for students, but living with students, learning together, working together, and overcoming difficulties together in practical work, promoting strengths, so that teachers and students understand each other, make progress with each other, and respect and love each other.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Min Ge She Reporter, Li Zhuang: Please Look at Today's Tianjin and Beiping - A Contrast of Darkness and Light - Part 2 <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>2. Thus is Beiping</p>
<p>Because Beiping is the location of the puppet government, on the surface it still seems very stable. Inside the city, one can hardly see any wartime atmosphere. However, this stability is ultimately false, and at night, one can often hear the clear sound of gunfire from the nearby suburbs.</p>
<p>Merchants in general are constantly complaining, because of the exorbitant taxes and sluggish business. Selling goods becomes more of a loss-making venture each day, but the cruel and unreasonable [Japanese] army also oppressively doesn't allow you to simply close shop. In the past, [Japanese] soldiers ran wildly through the streets, grabbing things without paying. The Hengdeli Clock and Watch Shop once suffered a great loss because of this. This is just one example among many incidents. In order to implement their deceiving, anesthetizing, and hypocritical political conspiracy, the [Japanese] "Beiping Garrison Commander" used the excuse of preserving international image, and ordered a strict prohibition of such illegal behavior. The recklessly rampant "Imperial Army" roaming the streets are now somewhat fewer in number, and they do give some money when they buy things, but the money they give is counterfeit, and they give at most eighty cents for something worth one dollar.</p>
<p>Bombings do not occur frequently within Beiping, mainly because the inspections upon entering the city are too strict. At the city gates, there are always three Japanese soldiers stationed, fully armed. One Chinese policeman only carries a metal knife. When entering the city gate, one must undergo a rigorous inspection. Staying in a hotel involves being checked an unknown number of times a night. Generally speaking, checks are more lenient in large hotels and stricter in smaller ones.</p>
<p>No matter how much the [Japanese] exaggerate and tout prosperity and recovery, in reality, business declines every day. The [Japanese] have systematically and methodically monopolized the trade of leather, wool, and hemp – three commodities related to military affairs. However, because of the active guerrillas in the surrounding areas, they cannot profit from this, and Chinese stores dealing in these commodities have had to close down. Other stores also have few visitors, in a state of desolation that is distressing to witness.</p>
<p>However, there are also abnormal phenomena amid the general trends, as can be seen in the abnormal prosperity of hotels and restaurants. Generally, remnants of the dying feudal system and insane traitors flock to the capital to seek official positions. They squander the wealth plundered from the people, indulging in lavish extravagance.</p>
<p>Government officials do not easily dare to come out, and spend their days hiding in small houses and safes as if under house arrest. They themselves know that traitors are public enemies and anyone is entitled to kill them.</p>
<p>Many middle schools and elementary schools have opened under the bayonets of the [Japanese], and the curriculum is filled with things like the divine might of the "Imperial Army" and a "paradise under benevolent rule"... Higher education institutions, such as Peking University, have been restored by the [Japanese], and they have also established the New People's College, a traitor-manufacturing institution. However, no matter how much the [Japanese] promote and reward it, there are still very few students seeking admission. Missionary schools, such as Yenching University, are still barely operating, and although they have foreign flags, they still cannot avoid the oppression and destruction of the [Japanese]. The number of students is also decreasing day by day.</p>
<p>There are several types of traitor newspapers, which all day long trumpet things like the heroism of the "Imperial Army" and the annihilation of the Party's army. However, if the people whose eyes have been covered by the [Japanese] pay attention to deduction, they can still glean some truth from the lines of text that the [Japanese] have not noticed or could not avoid. A traitor newspaper published the following news item: "The people of Liaoxian, under the command of the about-to-be-defeated anti-Japanese government and the Communist army, emptied the city, carrying away all livestock, causing the Imperial Army great difficulty in obtaining food and drink, and the roads were mostly destroyed, making troop movements extremely inconvenient."</p>
<p>The general price level has increased by one-third compared to before the war. Some things are simply not available—such as items related to military supplies. Western goods are more expensive, while Japanese goods are cheaper, mainly because imported Japanese goods are almost tax-free.</p>
<p>The general populace is angry but dare not speak out. Their sentiments for national salvation are generally very high. They hope all day long that the National Army can strike Beiping soon. Although they suffer severe persecution and prohibition, they still receive some true news of the resistance against Japan in educational institutions. Many people have radios, and those who don't have radios often exchange "information." They are completely clear that the [Japanese] rule cannot extend beyond the range of artillery, and they all believe that the final victory will definitely be ours. In the nearby western suburbs, our guerrillas are constantly active. In counties farther from Beiping, the [Japanese] control is naturally even weaker, to the point of being non-existent. The puppet "Zhili Provincial Governor" Gao Lingxiao once shamelessly uttered the lament of "no province to govern."</p>
<p>3. The "Royal Collaboration Army" Also Helps Us</p>
<p>Because the [Japanese] have very few troops, they mostly rely on the strength of the Royal Collaboration Army to govern. However, this kind of force is unreliable. The [Japanese] themselves seem to know this, so from beginning to end, they only put them in less important places to be responsible for "guarding." In a certain place not far from Beiping, there is a Royal Collaboration Army stationed. This regiment of the Royal Collaboration Army once made a "non-aggression pact" with our certain army. They supply the certain army with two boxes of ammunition every day, and when the certain army destroys roads or telephone poles, they cannot come out to interfere.</p>
<p>The situation is probably beyond the [Japanese] expectations. Many Royal Collaboration Army soldiers often give us a lot of help, such as supplying ammunition and purchasing important military supplies on our behalf. Once, nineteen members of our certain army in plainclothes were stopped by sentries of the Imperial Army, but these nineteen brave members of the certain army, without any fear, lectured them at length on the great principles of being human. Perhaps these Royal Collaboration Army soldiers discovered a bit of conscience at that time, and let these dozen or so people go without harming them in the slightest.</p>
<p>4. The Sinful Tianjin</p>
<p>From Beiping to Tianjin, there are three passenger trains running day and night. Two during the day, and one at night, but that nighttime train is almost entirely empty, because no one dares to risk the expected danger of "nine derailments out of ten trips."</p>
<p>The [Japanese] are even more licentious and shameless in Tianjin than in Beiping, but we also have a greater hidden strength in Tianjin than in Beiping.</p>
<p>First of all, prices in Tianjin are similar to those in Beiping, up thirty percent from before the incident. European and American goods are scarce and expensive, while Japanese goods are plentiful and cheap.</p>
<p>Anyone who sees Tianjin now will say, "It's getting worse every day." Indeed, the larger businesses are completely monopolized by the [Japanese]. Most Japanese goods are directly shipped to other counties through Japanese trading houses. Chinese shops, on the one hand, are suffering from sluggish business, and on the other hand, are under the high pressure of exorbitant taxes and heavy levies. How can they not decline day by day? But in order to "beautify the city," you are not allowed to simply "close down."</p>
<p>The [Japanese] army in Tianjin is more reckless than in Beiping. Most of the major intersections are guarded by sandbags and well-armed Japanese soldiers. But despite the [Japanese] heightened vigilance, our guerrillas still break into the [Japanese] security lines from time to time. Bombing incidents in the city are common. On the twenty-third day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar last year, a movie theater in the Japanese concession publicly screened a film insulting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. But soon after the screening began, someone threw in a bomb, resulting in fourteen deaths and injuries. The brave man who threw the bomb safely escaped. At the Zhongyuan Company, on the streetcar... bomb cases occur from time to time.</p>
<p>The [Japanese] are trying every possible means to destroy the legal currency, so they have repeatedly ordered either to exchange the legal currency for counterfeit money by a certain date, or that no one may carry more than one hundred yuan of legal currency by a certain date. However, only the devils obey these ridiculous orders. The credibility of the legal currency has instead become more stable because of the [Japanese] attempts to undermine it. In the British and French concessions, our legal currency banks still exist, and people can exchange damaged legal currency at any time. The ratio of legal currency to counterfeit money in the British and French concessions is nine to ten—counterfeit money is not very common in the concessions. In the Japanese concession, the ratio is reversed, ten to nine. In Hebei—Chinese territory—the ratio is ten to ten. However, generally larger businesses hide all their legal currency and spend the counterfeit money first. Therefore, the counterfeit money, which is not very numerous, is now scorned and flies around everywhere. Whoever gets it has a headache. In reality, one unit of legal currency can buy much more than one unit of counterfeit money.</p>
<p>There are very many counterfeit banknotes that can be seen in Tianjin. Counterfeit banknotes from the "China United Reserve Bank," the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Manchuria are all circulating in Tianjin, but their scope of circulation and credibility are far inferior to our legal currency and the Hebei Provincial banknotes. Because the [Japanese] saw that the credibility of our legal currency was unshakably stable, they recently massively counterfeited it, exchanging it with traitors at a rate of thirty yuan of genuine legal currency for one hundred yuan of fake legal currency, and the traitors took it to the market to thoroughly disrupt it.</p>
<p>There are very many traitor newspapers, the larger ones being the Yong Bao, Xin Tianjin Bao, and Manchuria Bao and the Korean Daily Newspaper. The editors of these newspapers are simply not human; they shamelessly call our troops the "Bandit Army." Very few people read these newspapers. If there are any, they are just a few pitiful merchants, but they read these newspapers not for the monotonous "Imperial Army advances on somewhere" or "the Party's army is completely annihilated," but to glean some "commercial information that is closely related to their interests." These newspapers also have so-called "supplements." Their "supplements" are filled with things like "How such-and-such model has sex."</p>
<p>Our newspapers circulate in the British and French concessions. Often, one person reads it in the concession and then returns to recite it to many people. The [Japanese] check people going to the British concession very strictly: they have laid dense layers of electric wire along the river, so people going to the concession have to go through the French bridge. Many unlucky people sometimes wait from early morning until midday and still cannot get through. The [Japanese]' own explanation for this behavior is that a large number of such-and-such army are hiding in such-and-such concession, and that certain army is constantly plotting to disrupt order.</p>
<p>The morale of the people of Tianjin is very high. This phenomenon can be seen from the bombing incidents that occur from time to time. They long for their own troops, their own planes, but in the sky often fly the Fascist iron eagles painted with poultice marks that give them headaches. But in the deep of night, one often hears the gunfire of our guerrillas, which is the most exciting thing.</p>
<p>In Tianjin, many good people often disappear and are arrested for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Beijing opera and "Bangzi" have mostly been fully restored, and their wonderful programs are things like "San Niang Teaches Her Son," "Zun Long Steals the Phoenix," and "Biography of a Virtuous Woman." Several movie theaters have also reopened, and their content is nothing more than "Annihilation of such-and-such army" and "Thighs," etc. However, movie theaters do not seem to be as thriving as Beijing opera theaters, probably because bomb cases often occur in movie theaters.</p>
<p>The Japanese concession has vividly become a den of demons. At dusk, every household broadcasts lewd noises and lascivious melodies that are fit only to pollute one's ears. Opium dens, gambling arenas, brothels, dance halls, massage parlors... are in addition to the manufacturing facilities for white powder, counterfeit money, peaceful atmosphere, and traitors. The streets are plastered with advertisements for "Sex Disease Treatment," "Aphrodisiac Pills," "Gonorrhea Cured in One Day," that make one want to vomit. Most of the brothels and gambling dens are run by Koreans, protected and assisted by the Japanese. The manufacturing facilities for traitors and counterfeit currency are all operated by Japanese intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Talking is very difficult in Tianjin, because you don't know who is a traitor. Many traitors often pretend to be united against the common enemy in order to trick you into saying what Chinese people should say, and then pull out a pistol and kidnap you to the Japanese concession.</p>
<p>The [Japanese] rule is very weak. In addition to our guerrillas operating in the surrounding suburbs, they also send plainclothes teams to operate in the urban areas from time to time, often causing the [Japanese] to panic and make a fool of themselves. Once, at a crossroads in Hebei, a volley of handguns suddenly sounded, which caused the Tianjin [Japanese] army to mobilize in full force, the Japanese concession was immediately under martial law, and heavy machine guns and small cannons were set up. However, the plainclothes team that fired the shots casually withdrew. A few bullets caused thousands of [Japanese] people to not sleep well all night.</p>
<p>Not only are the [Japanese] unable to rule us, but serious cracks often appear within the [Japanese] themselves. In the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, such a thing happened:</p>
<p>The [Japanese] Navy stationed in Tianjin was ordered to return home for rest, but encountered strong opposition from the [Japanese] Army stationed in Tianjin, because these Army troops were all transferred from outside the customs, and had not returned home for several years. The treatment of the Navy and Army seemed too unequal. As a result, the two sides had an armed conflict, fighting fiercely for a day and night. The number of dead and wounded totaled more than two hundred people. Later, the war was quelled through the mediation and efforts of the consuls of various countries and the rebuke of the authorities on both sides of the Navy and Army. Also, the mutiny of the Japanese army at Dagu Port that occurred not long ago can also be seen as a good example of the internal division of the [Japanese] army.</p>
<p>5. Coda</p>
<p>These two major cities in North China, Beiping and Tianjin, are now indeed full of bloodshed and filth, massacre and terror. However, given our insistence on a protracted war of resistance and our determination not to stop until the final victory, given the increasingly favorable international situation, and given the increasingly surging anti-war movement within [Japanese] , we believe—firmly believe—that in the near future, they—Beiping and Tianjin—will surely once again be covered with the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, and see the light of day again.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region Shatters the [Japanese] Encirclement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Min Ge She Correspondent's Manuscript] The director of the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, Hu Meiting, and the director of the Department of Education, Liu Ding'an, came to Lan on the twenty-second day of the previous month. In addition to launching a warm welcome party on the twenty-third, the War Mobilization Association also held a tea party on the evening of the twenty-fourth. At this meeting, comrades Hu and Liu explained in detail the financial and trade policies of the border region, as well as the process of how they recently shattered the [Japanese] encirclement. The latter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"The Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region has given the [Japanese] a severe blow in terms of military, politics, and economy, causing the [Japanese] to harbor resentment and constantly want to 'annihilate' it in one fell swoop. Last August, the [Japanese] planned to transfer four divisions to encircle the border region, but later, due to insufficient troops, they only transferred two divisions, about 50,000 people. Before taking action, they sent a large number of trained traitors to infiltrate the border region. The border region government had already noticed this. In early October, the [Japanese] began a ten-pronged encirclement, with one prong each from Dingxiang, Daixian, Fanshi, Lingqiu, Weixian, Ziyuan, and Baoding. In addition, they attacked PingShang from Shijiazhuang, and Mengxian from the Zhengtai Railway. The [Japanese] had sufficient troops and supplies for this attack, so it was estimated that the [Japanese] would hold several strongholds and at the same time connect these strongholds. Wutai Mountain would become a guerrilla zone. Based on this estimate, they implemented a policy of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, and transferred the main organs to different areas. At that time, our army, being outnumbered, would definitely suffer if fighting on all sides, so it was decided to loosen the north and south and concentrate firepower to deal with the east and west. The [Japanese]' military weakness is 'rigid adherence to orders and lack of maneuverability.' They were ordered to converge on Wutai Mountain. We seized on this weakness of the [Japanese] and thoroughly strengthened the walls and cleared the fields on the road to Wutai Mountain, trapping the [Japanese]. Our army first attacked the main force from Quyang to Fuping. Of the thousand or so [Japanese] troops, five hundred were wiped out. Later, the [Japanese] reinforced with three thousand troops, so our army abandoned Fuping. After some work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, only [Japanese] military slogans remained in the streets and alleys of Fuping. As a result, although the [Japanese] occupied Fuping, supplies had to come from the rear. Our army then specialized in attacking the [Japanese] supplies, forcing the [Japanese] to retreat due to supply difficulties. Our army estimated that the vast [Japanese] army would retreat, so it implemented ambushes and tail attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the [Japanese]. At that time, only a few hundred [Japanese] were left to defend Fuping, and our army launched a surprise attack on them. They broke through and fled, and our army and the people shouted and chased after them, killing more than half of the [Japanese]. On the western front, our army was hiding around Wutai Mountain in advance. After the [Japanese] advanced to Wutai Mountain, most of them withdrew back to the city. Several hundred [Japanese] once came out to intercept and attack our troops stationed at Hekou, gaining considerable advantage and returning triumphantly. While passing through the strategic area of Shipenkou, they were ambushed by us and completely annihilated, with only a few people escaping. The [Japanese] on the north and south roads were originally meant to coordinate. The [Japanese] on the north road had already been defeated. The [Japanese] on the south road came from Mengxian, an isolated army of about a thousand people. After arriving at Wutai Mountain, they were surrounded by us. This entire force was made up of Japanese soldiers. Because of their superior weapons, they could not be completely wiped out. After being surrounded for more than a week, they automatically withdrew, with hundreds of deaths and the death of one commander. This time, the [Japanese] siege was defeated due to the correct use of our guerrilla tactics and the coordination of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields! Now, only a few people remain in Wutai, Hebian, Dongye, and other places!"</p>
<p>This piece of fact tells us that as long as we correctly use guerrilla tactics and coordinate with the strength of the people, the ferocious [Japanese] can be easily wiped out. We should learn this precious lesson!</p>
<h3 id="e5">Our Great Army Controls Southwestern Shanxi, Putting Us in an Advantageous Position in the Overall War Situation; Enemy Aircraft Losses Excessive, Morale Declining <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] Each battle strengthens our army's ability to resist the war. Therefore, the enemy's offensives in various places have failed. Currently, the overall situation is advantageous to us. Most of the enemy reinforcements in various places recently are Taiwanese, Koreans, and puppet troops. Moreover, they are patching up shortages, so the new additions are limited. Because of the difficulty in making military progress, the enemy is using aircraft to disrupt our rear areas. According to investigations of their main base in Hankou, enemy aircraft stationed there have been shot down by us in various places recently, resulting in heavy losses. Now, the enemy's morale is increasingly declining, and the period of our final victory is near.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to reports, fierce fighting continues in the southeastern part of Shandong. We are taking advantage of the terrain in the Mengyin and Yishui areas to continue attacking the enemy, launching large-scale guerrilla warfare. The enemy's rear outposts are frequently attacked by us, and railways and highways are frequently destroyed by us. Their invasion plan has completely failed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 14th Dispatch] The enemy troops that retreated from Jinxi to Lishi and Zhongyang are now under the control of our great army. There are no enemy traces near the Yellow River bank. Fighting remains fierce in southern Shanxi. The enemy's main force is concentrated in Ruicheng and Fenglingdu, seemingly attempting to cross the river. We are making efforts to drive them away.</p>
<p>Progress on All Fronts in Shanxi Province</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to reliable Chinese sources, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi, after recovering Pinglu Maojindu some days ago, is now advancing northward. Anyi on the Tongpu Railway is being defended by the Japanese army, which has suffered heavy losses and been forced to retreat there, attempting to maintain control of the town. Anyi is a key military location on the Tongpu Railway. As for Lishi on the western Shanxi front, it remains a target of the Chinese army's offensive. According to other sources, the southern Chinese army has advanced to Zhongyang, very close to the city, and within range of the Chinese army's artillery. Considering the overall situation, although the battles on this front are considered secondary, they are sufficient to crush any further attempts by the Japanese army to advance deeper. Moreover, by implementing mobile warfare strategies and surprise attacks, the Japanese side has suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army south of Yueyang in northern Hunan is also using these strategies, achieving similar results. As for the Qianjiang front, the fighting is calm, it is said.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 14th Dispatch] More than a thousand enemy troops from Lishi launched an offensive toward Anjiagou and Junjiacen on the morning of the 13th. A unit of our army has rushed to intercept them. On the same day, one to two thousand enemy troops from Hanqiaocun and Dakuancun (south of Zhangdian) also raided the line of Guanjialiang (northeast of Dakuancun) and Jushizhuang (south of Dakuancun). They encountered our army, and a fierce battle ensued for half a day. Subsequently, enemy reinforcements steadily increased. In the afternoon, we shifted to the line of Huashuping and Yushuao, continuing to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 14th Dispatch] Enemy troops at Yongji Station were attacked by a unit of our army on the morning of the 9th, killing dozens of enemy soldiers. At the same time, a unit of our army stormed into Yangcheng Temple in Hanyang Town, destroying the enemy's ammunition and supply depots. The enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 15th Dispatch] According to a telephone report from the front, the enemy west of Linfen is stirring again. Three to four hundred enemy troops from Heilongguan launched a fierce attack southward on Nanwanli (south of Heilongguan) on the morning of the 14th. At the same time, six to seven hundred enemy troops from Tumen invaded westward through Hongliangou (south of Tumen), and another unit of more than two hundred troops from Huadongsi (south of Tumen) attempted a large-scale westward offensive. Our forces on all fronts have engaged them, and in a confused battle that lasted until 2 p.m., we seized the opportunity to recover strongholds such as Nanwanli and Jianzipo. A unit of our army also launched a fierce attack on Jiantou (southeast of Tumen), attempting to cut off the enemy's rear and annihilate them. Six to seven hundred enemy troops from Jinxiang Town in Fenxi also launched an offensive westward on the morning of the 13th. We are engaging them on all fronts.</p>
<p>Our Army Launches Attacks in Hunan and Hubei</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 15th Dispatch] On the morning of the 14th, a unit of our army attacked the enemy camp at Tongpenling (one kilometer south of Nanlinqiao), capturing the high ground southwest of Tongpenling. Another unit of our army had already recovered Tangpingpu and Shentangpu on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 15th Dispatch] The enemy troops at Yanziji near Qianjiang were driven away by us on the 14th, and we have dispatched troops to garrison the area south of Qianjiang. Our Dare-to-Die squads are posting slogans in Chinese and Japanese, damaging power lines, and carrying out guerrilla warfare against the enemy with great enthusiasm. Enemy troops in Suixian are constructing fortifications, attempting to hold on.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 14th Dispatch] More than two hundred enemy troops in Suixian, along with a small number of enemy cavalry, are constantly harassing the area. We frequently send teams to suppress them, and the enemy suffers losses from time to time.</p>
<p>Air Force Launches Surprise Attack on Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 14th Dispatch] According to people from Guangzhou, several squadrons of our air force launched a surprise attack on Guangzhou on the 10th, displaying great prowess. They dropped dozens of bombs in the suburbs of Guangzhou, destroying several enemy ammunition and food depots, as well as numerous defensive works.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 15th Dispatch] Thirteen enemy aircraft attacked Wengyuan, Lianping, and areas under Pajiang in three waves on the 14th, dropping eighteen bombs in Nanpu (under Wengyuan), Longqi, Hutoushi, and other places near Lianping, causing no major losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 14th Dispatch] On the 11th, more than two hundred enemy and puppet troops, aboard two shallow-draft vessels and six motorboats, launched an offensive toward Guzhen in Zhongshan, attempting to land. Our defending troops, together with local defense teams, met them head-on with fierce attacks. The enemy suffered heavy losses and fled back to Jiangmen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shantou, 14th Dispatch] The number of enemy warships off Shantou increased to six on the night of the 13th. Starting at 8 p.m., they dispatched more than twenty ships, first approaching Ma'yu and then spying on the lighthouse. Our defending troops met them head-on with fierce attacks. The enemy, failing in their attempt, fled at 12 a.m.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Briefly Entered</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th Dispatch] According to news from Shanghai, relayed by people from Hangzhou, our guerrillas and plainclothes teams recently attacked enemy troops in the Bijiaofang, Yunsihexia, and Gongchenqiao areas of Hangzhou City. This was the first brave act since Hangzhou fell. Residents of Hangzhou, although living in a dangerous city, were all pleasantly surprised. The enemy troops were thrown into a panic. The situation in Hangzhou is now extremely tense. A curfew is imposed every day at 5 p.m., and gunfire is frequent and dense throughout the night. There is constant artillery fire on both banks of the Jiantang River. Night trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have been suspended, and there have been many casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chong Liao, 14th Dispatch] According to news from Shanghai, the guerrillas near Yangxing completely destroyed all transportation on the night of the 11th into the early morning, and engaged in conflict with enemy troops. A fire broke out amongst the enemy troops, and casualties reached more than thirty. Traffic between Zhejiang and Shanghai has also been cut off. Currently, the enemy is arresting residents near Yangxing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuliang, 13th Dispatch] Our mobile artillery along the river once again displayed their skill at 9 a.m. on the 12th. At the time, three enemy transport ships were sailing upstream. We subjected them to heavy fire. One ship was hit seven times and sailed away wounded. Another ship was hit twenty-five times, and its stern immediately sank. The third ship, seeing the dangerous situation, turned downward and fled.</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Tingkeler Beating Death Case: The Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Japanese Side; Most of the Japanese Propaganda is Fabricated; Preliminary Hearing Results from the British Consular Court <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th Dispatch] Tingkeler, a British employee of the British-owned Lun Chang Company, was recently killed by Japanese soldiers. The British Consular Court here specially opened a trial this morning for this case. The result of the trial showed that when Tingkeler fired his gun, his target was neither Japanese nor Chinese. According to Franklin, a witness present at the time, when Tingkeler struggled with a Japanese sailor, he aimed his pistol at the ground and deliberately avoided the Japanese and Chinese people present. Three other British employees of Lun Chang Company, Carterwick, Prokos, and Scott, tried to persuade Tingkeler to take a more reasonable approach to the matter, but the Japanese soldiers still insulted and beat Tingkeler with wooden sticks, pistols, and bayonets. I witnessed Tingkeler being knocked to the ground, but the soldiers continued to humiliate and beat him, forcing him to drag forward for thirty yards, causing Tingkeler to bleed profusely. When Tingkeler fired his gun, he did not aim at the Japanese sailors. According to Dr. Konak, when I arrived in Pudong, I saw that Tingkeler's injuries were extremely serious, his hands were cold, and his pulse had almost stopped. However, if surgery could have been performed earlier, there would have been a great hope of recovery.</p>
<p>A Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e8">Diocesan Boys' School Student Unrest <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Diocesan Boys' School student unrest has been widely reported in various newspapers, and those concerned about education in Hong Kong are paying serious attention to it.</p>
<p>The cause of this student unrest was the students' opposition to a Japanese student named Peng being the head prefect. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××. To be fair, if students really want to interfere with school administration, they would never be willing to merely walk out passively. Moreover, students consider studying their primary duty, and if they have free time after class, they are eager to have proper entertainment. Why bother—and why is it necessary—to interfere with school administration? For students to abandon their studies and be in conflict with the school authorities they are close to, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××, therefore, we believe that the occurrence of this Diocesan Boys' School student unrest; the students' painful departure is close to what the ancients called "direct remonstrance." It is definitely not permissible—and we cannot bear—to add the great crime of "interfering with school administration."</p>
<p>According to repeated statements from the Diocesan Boys' School authorities, they have always expressed sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. Even a person of a hostile nationality has such sentiments, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××; as long as we acknowledge that the departure of the Diocesan Boys' School students is not an interference with school administration but simply a natural expression of patriotism, we can conclude that the solution to this matter is extremely simple: the school authorities and the departing students, based on their usual teacher-student relationship, should have a sincere discussion. On the one hand, the school should voluntarily replace the head prefect, and on the other hand, the departing students should voluntarily resume classes. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××, we should use the method of "cutting the Gordian knot quickly" to resolve the matter once and for all. We foresee that after the unrest subsides, the relationship between Diocesan Boys' School teachers and students will be even deeper than before!</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 15th Dispatch] On Thursday morning, Japanese troops were dispatched to occupy the premises of the British-owned Jardine Matheson Company. All employees, even Japanese, were not allowed to pass through the area, and the Japanese authorities refused to announce the reasons for this action. This company is the second largest British trading house in the Far East.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 15th Dispatch] On the second day of the blockade of the Tianjin Concession, several agitators gathered two thousand Chinese people at the end of Race Course Road on the edge of the Concession, attempting to break through the Concession's barriers. British troops, including the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, armed with machine guns, rushed to the scene and deployed police in front of the barriers. As a result, the crowd dispersed. Currently, the food situation here is very worrying. There is a lack of vegetables and daily necessities, but the supply of rice is still abundant.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 15th Dispatch] According to Japanese news, 50,000 Japanese are planning to carry out a "peaceful invasion" of the British Concession in Tianjin on Saturday. The participants are all local Japanese residents. They are determined to visit the Japanese military cemetery for the fallen in the Boxer Rebellion, and 2,000 Japanese reservists will participate in the parade. According to a Japanese newspaper report from Tianjin, as a result of yesterday's Japanese blockade, traffic between the Chinese area of the Japanese Concession and the British and French Concessions has decreased by one-fifth compared to normal. Of the 100,000 Chinese who normally need to go to the British and French Concessions for work every day, less than 2,000 were able to enter the Concessions by noon yesterday. The Japanese side made a perfunctory "apology," claiming that the current suppression of "communist" elements based in the Concessions is unavoidable, hence the delays.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch] According to a Japanese news agency in Tianjin, three Japanese tanks appeared outside the boundary of the British Concession this afternoon. It is said that the tanks were dispatched because British troops had set up a guard post with three machine guns facing a Japanese sentry post not far from a Japanese inspection team, which the Japanese news agency described as having a "mysterious challenging implication".</p>

<p>—Firefly</p>
<p>A Rainy Night in Longhua</p>
<p>On rainy evenings, rural villages always have clusters of smoke curling up from the roofs, but Longhua Market did not have this phenomenon. From Taihe Market, we looked into the distance at Longhua. That gathering of over a hundred Chinese shops showed signs of devastation, unlike its usual ability to huddle together like a covey of quails. Taking advantage of the bad situation, people doing business were scattering to the east, west, south, and north, leaving behind a ruined and desolate town to accompany this miserable evening after the rain.</p>
<p>We approached Longhua. The streets we passed were filled with broken walls and rubble. We smelled the burnt odor. This smell, after encountering the wet steam on the burnt soil walls, was even more intense, rushing into our nostrils in waves. We better understood the "firepower" of the "Imperial Army"—this smell can produce a chemical reaction and increase our body temperature!</p>
<p>Passing by Fuchang Temple, there were many small pavilion-style stalls covered with thatched grass. The ground was trodden into a muddy mess, and there were sugarcane dregs, fruit peels, and all sorts of things that should be found after the clearing of the markets in the city. However, the people had long dispersed. We realized that this was the temporary market for our wartime civilians. At the same time, it reminded me of the story of "setting up a market at noon" that my teacher told me in my childhood.</p>
<p>We ran through the entire town. There was not a single intact house. Besides discovering a few elderly or middle-aged women dressed in rags with children in the ruins of the burned-down buildings, cooking on makeshift stoves made of brick fragments, there were no other people anywhere. I really cannot describe the desolation and misery of this town after being burned and killed by the Japanese. It only increased the sorrow in my heart.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Township Office and met Township Head Li Yu. We took off our drenched clothes, and everyone felt a little cold. Fortunately, the cotton clothes distributed to the refugees had not been completely distributed yet. Everyone took one to put on. Men and women all wearing these clothes looked just like refugees. We requested a solution to the problem of hunger and asked Clerk Yao (whom we had temporarily designated) to take care of it. He ran out like a flash and came back a moment later with the answer: "I can't buy anything, even rice is a problem." We were a little anxious, especially the dozen or so porters. Later, we discussed it with the Township Head and asked him to find a way. In the end, a solution was found. What about sleeping? This problem was now before us. The universe used darkness to urge us to solve this problem, but it was not difficult. "Each sweeps the snow from in front of his own door." Borrowing doors and other things, it was solved in various ways.</p>
<p>After solving the three problems of clothing, food, and shelter, we had to solve the problem of "travel." How should the propaganda work be carried out here? How should we finish the section of the road from Longning to Futian tomorrow? How should we carry out the propaganda work along the way? So, we held an evening meeting. In the meeting, everyone reported on the work just done in Longhua. "There was no one from the Youth Resistance Association, and there was no way to contact them." "The proclamation to the people has been posted." "Oral propaganda could not be carried out, only visits to a few old women." The result of the review was: "The estimation was insufficient, and the arrangements were not good."</p>
<p>After deciding on the itinerary and work for tomorrow in the meeting, we also sang a few songs to wake up this silent, dead city. Wasn't that so? For the entire night, there was no sound at all. Even the barking of dogs in the distance could not be heard.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th Dispatch] A Havas Agency reporter learned that the British Cabinet discussed the situation in Tianjin, China, today and immediately decided to order the Department of Commerce to draft a report proposing various means of economic retaliation against Japan, so that they could be gradually implemented if the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin lasted too long. It is said that the retaliatory measures include the following: (1) Imposing special taxes on Japanese ships docking in British ports, or restricting the rights of Japanese ships to dock in those ports. (2) Imposing import tariffs and restricting the quantity of Japanese goods imported into British colonies. (3) Taking some kind of action against Japanese currency. At this time, the British government is awaiting a report from Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, informing them whether the Japanese government supports the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin. Government officials believe that there is not much hope of reconciliation, and only say that retaliatory measures must be implemented sooner or later.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th Dispatch] The British government attaches extreme importance to the Tianjin incident, and expects that the Japanese side may take similar anti-British actions elsewhere. Therefore, all relevant departments of the Department of Trade are considering how to deal with similar incidents that may occur in other places. It is said that terminating the British-Japanese commercial treaty and canceling Japan's preferential commercial rights in British territories are under consideration by the department.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] Regarding the statement by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler in the House of Commons, according to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the British government is closely studying several aspects of the Japanese attitude towards British interests in Tianjin. It is generally believed that the Japanese side may launch similar actions elsewhere, and the Department of Commerce and other departments are currently discussing steps to deal with these actions. The dependence of Japanese markets on the United Kingdom and its colonies is also one of the issues currently being studied.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] The China Sub-Committee of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee sent representatives to visit Under-Secretary Butler this afternoon. It is reported that the two sides discussed the entire British situation in China, and the representative believed that Britain should take a tough stance to deal with Japan's provocative actions in Tianjin, not only to maintain this position in principle, but also to avoid setting a dangerous precedent by showing weakness. Under-Secretary Butler expressed sympathy for the representative's views and agreed to forward the representative's opinions to Foreign Secretary Halifax. Prior to this, Labor MPs had also sent representatives to visit Butler to discuss the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Cabinet discussed the Tianjin incident and all aspects of British interests in China this morning.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from outside Xiamen, three Japanese warships have blockaded Gulangyu, prohibiting the transport of food to Gulangyu, resulting in a shortage of food. The 50,000 residents here are in a state of panic. Japanese newspapers say that firewood, coal, and vegetables are all prohibited. A Japanese spokesperson said that the main purpose of this move by the Japanese side is to make the Gulangyu Municipal Council realize what is happening, in other words, to urge them to accept the Japanese demands. The Japanese authorities had previously provided assurances that they would cooperate with the Municipal Council to stop illegal activities, but now they are taking blockade measures, which affects the major interests of China. The representative believes that Britain should adopt a tough stance to deal with Japan's provocative actions in Tianjin, not only to maintain this position in principle, but also to avoid setting a dangerous precedent by showing weakness. Under-Secretary Butler expressed sympathy for the representative's views and agreed to forward the representative's opinions to Foreign Secretary Halifax.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from outside Tianjin, the food problem in the Concessions is gradually becoming serious. Although there are still stocks of rice and flour, there is a shortage of vegetables, beef, and milk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from outside Tianjin, today is the second day of the Japanese military blockade of the British and French Concessions. There are still a large number of people waiting at the entrances and exits. The Japanese military inspection is still strict, and the situation is generally the same as yesterday. Although the Japanese military pays attention to inspecting British nationals, they also inspect those who want to enter the British Concession. Today, two German women and several Russian women were also inspected. Even showing their documents had no effect. However, women are inspected by female inspectors.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from Tianjin, the British Consul-General in Tianjin has advised British shipping companies not to sail on the Hai River for the time being.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th Dispatch] According to news from Tianjin, a barge from the British company Jardine Matheson was sailing downstream this morning when it was ordered to stop and was thoroughly inspected by the Japanese side when it passed outside the boundary of the Concession. A few minutes later, the ship was again ordered to stop for inspection by the Japanese side at the Dalian Mail Ship Company pier. The sailors on board were not hindered. There has been no change in the situation near the Concession. There is a lot of traffic of Chinese vehicles in the Concession, so the inside of the Concession is very quiet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from Shanghai, various companies in Shanghai have temporarily suspended the transportation of goods to Tianjin, but passenger transport continues as usual.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th Dispatch] Political circles say that the main issue discussed by French Prime Minister Daladier and British Ambassador Phipps yesterday was the Tianjin incident. It is rumored that Britain and France will jointly send a note to the Japanese government in Tokyo, protesting the Japanese military blockade of the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. If the Japanese side does not stop the blockade, Japanese ships will not be allowed to enter the port of Singapore. However, it is said that the French Cabinet has not yet accepted the British proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e18">×Blockade of Tianjin Concession: How Did It Happen? Parisian Newspapers Speculate <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] Today, the newspapers here all commented on the Japanese army's blockade of the Tianjin concession, which was implemented when British representative Sir Stafford Cripps arrived in Moscow. Political commentator Pertinax wrote in "Le Temps" that, "Can we imagine that Germany and Italy, unable to obtain the cooperation of the Japanese Navy in the Mediterranean, are exerting pressure to have Japan strike in the Far East at a critical moment in European negotiations?" "Figaro" reported that Japan had four possible motives: (1) to threaten Britain, (2) to respond to Germany, (3) to respond to the German and Italian request for Japan to join a military alliance, and (4) to change the course of the war in China. "L'Humanité" declared that Japan, at the request of the Axis powers, wants to use intimidation and threats to prevent the realization of the "peace front." Madame Tabouis also wrote in "L'Oeuvre," commenting on the matter, "We do not need to overemphasize the Japanese military blockade of Tianjin, but Britain must not yield. This is a probing action by the Japanese side to determine possible actions in Shanghai."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] Here, Saulnier, the editor of "L'Ère nouvelle," commented yesterday that the Tianjin incident should not be regarded as an isolated event, but as a new development in the international situation. Telegrams from various places also confirm the same opinion. Saulnier said that Japan is merely using the excuse of handing over the Chinese, but is actually carrying out an anti-British movement. Japan's move stems from a desire to strengthen German-Japanese ties, and Japan wants to harass Britain in the Far East in order to assist its European allies. "Paris-Soir" stated that Britain, the United States, and France are preparing to establish mediation with Japan as soon as possible to prevent the Tianjin incident from becoming more serious. The newspaper also implied that Western countries are still focusing on European events. Japan's recent actions will prompt Western countries to quickly form an alliance with the Soviet Union, and this action will also make the Soviet Union willing to conclude an agreement with Western countries.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 15th] According to a Japanese news agency from Tianjin, if the current Japanese plan ultimately fails, the Japanese authorities there have decided to take another tough step. Therefore, the only way to resolve the Tianjin incident is for Britain to revise its entire China policy, and not just settle for local negotiations. Because the Japanese in Tianjin feel that the time for resolving some individual issues piecemeal has passed, and it is not enough to satisfy them unless the entire Chinese concession is fundamentally resolved. In Tokyo, according to well-informed Japanese sources, it is rumored that Britain is currently considering economic retaliation, but Japan will not change its policy because of this, and this is because once sanctions against Japan are implemented, it will naturally conflict with the current Anglo-Japanese trade treaty, and Japan will inevitably take swift and effective counter-measures. Today, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma reported on the situation in China to the cabinet councilors, and at the same time discussed the issue of thoroughly implementing the "National Mobilization Law" and the Japanese government's price policy with the councilors. According to Rear Admiral Kanazawa, director of the Japanese Navy Ministry's Intelligence Bureau, the Japanese authorities have decided to resolve the Gulangyu incident peacefully.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki held a three-person meeting to discuss the Tianjin incident and the issue of foreign concessions in China. It is heard that the Japanese government has decided to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin until Britain unconditionally agrees to accept Japan's demands. Afterwards, Army Minister Itagaki further met with the Emperor of Japan to report on Japan's plan for the Tianjin incident.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The State Department today formally denied rumors that the US government intends to mediate the Anglo-Japanese dispute in Tianjin. Secretary of State Hull also stated that he had not heard of the United States mediating the Tianjin incident, but the United States is still willing to do its best to resolve the case peacefully. He continued that the US government has ordered its diplomatic representatives in Tianjin to pay attention to the development of the Tianjin situation and, to the best of its ability, protect the lives and property of American merchants and residents in Tianjin. In addition, the US government will negotiate with Japan at any time on issues related to the United States. Some time ago, the US government prohibited merchant ships from transporting military supplies to Tianjin, otherwise, in the event of an accident, the US government would not be able to protect them. Regarding the Gulangyu issue, the United States has not raised any special negotiations with Japan.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 14th] French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar, visited British Ambassador Sir William Seeds and Sir Stafford Cripps, the head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, at 6:00 PM today, for an hour. Cripps immediately informed Naggiar of the contents of the instructions he brought.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] According to Moscow reports in "Paris-Soir," the difficulty of guaranteeing the Baltic countries has not yet been removed.

Sir Stafford Cripps, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, had lengthy discussions with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds on the first day of his arrival in Moscow, and visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 14th] The Finnish Foreign Minister's official newspaper responded to the Soviet "Pravda," saying, "It is unfriendly to offer guarantees to countries that do not want to accept them and are prepared to defend themselves. To impose guarantees is tantamount to aggression and damages the sovereignty of other countries." "Pravda" had on Tuesday demanded that guarantees be given to Finland, Sweden, and Latvia, and indicated that Estonia. The reason why the Finnish Foreign Minister adopted a cold attitude was probably due to the influence of Sweden.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th] Yesterday, in the British House of Commons, someone asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether there had been any progress in the negotiations on the Anglo-Soviet agreement.

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] The Japanese Cabinet has decided on a plan to promote national material mobilization this year, but the details are still kept secret. The content of the new plan, as expressed externally, is the restriction of civilian material consumption, but because the Japanese government is keeping it secret, the people are complaining, thinking that the government should trust the people and publicly announce the details of the new plan. According to "Miyako Shimbun," "Since the 'China Incident' occurred, the Japanese people have felt inconvenience. Fortunately, Japan's food can still be self-sufficient, and there is no fear of famine. Under the new mobilization plan, the restriction of most materials is even stricter, so if you want to promote it smoothly, you must be careful and do not make the people feel panic. Although in reality, the Japanese government's method of allocating materials is not thorough, the result is the occurrence of various conflicts and frictions."</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] In the British House of Commons today, Labour MP Kirkwood asked the Admiralty whether it knew that it was very difficult to tie ropes to submarines. Considering other methods, Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty Shakespeare replied that this situation does exist, but tying ropes to the sunken submarine has not yet been able to salvage the submarine. This matter and similar problems regarding salvage are all under the government's consideration.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] Germany is displeased that Britain first offered guarantees to Romania and will then conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. According to political sources, Germany is putting pressure on Romania, informing it that if the Anglo-Soviet agreement is concluded, Romania will indirectly receive Soviet guarantees, and the country will naturally regard it as a future enemy. For the sake of Romania, it seems that it should reconsider the layer of guarantees it has received from Britain.</p>

<p>German Secret Police Chief Has Arrived in Prague, Highway on Czech Border Ordered to Suspend Passenger Transport</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] According to the "Times" correspondent in Prague, the chief of the German Secret Police, Himmler, has arrived in Prague, so the tension in Czechoslovakia has further increased. Recently, incidents have occurred in Kralove and Nachod, and Germans and Czechs have died, which makes the people there feel that there will be some changes soon. Some Czechs believe that Germany will first take action in Slovakia, and then change the status of Czechoslovakia. Germany has stationed troops in Slovakia and has been sending troops to northeastern Moravia near the Slovak border in the past few weeks. The seizure of Slovakia does not require Germany to mobilize large numbers of troops. The correspondent also described the symbols of German action in the next few days: (1) Locomotives in Prague and Pardubice must be prepared for the next two days; (2) Roads from Brno to Olomouc and Jihlava will also be closed to civilian traffic for two days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] According to information obtained by the "New York Times" from "foreign private sources," 250,000 German troops are concentrated on the Polish border in northern Slovakia, including five infantry divisions, two tank divisions, and one heavy artillery division. The newspaper also carried a message from Prague with the headline "Czechs Fear They Will See Another Step by the Nazis to Seize Slovakia Today."</p>
<p>German Officials Still Deny</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 15th] Foreign newspapers are rumored to be mobilizing German troops on the Polish and Slovak borders, and there will be action. Regarding this matter, the newspapers here all published official denials in the most prominent position on the front page last night, saying that Britain and France deliberately spread this kind of news to divert the attention of the people at home, so that the obstacles to reaching an understanding with Moscow could be concealed. For example, London issued a message that German troops were preparing to enter Slovakia, making Slovakia a German protectorate. Paris said that German troops were rapidly setting up defenses along the Polish border, strengthening defenses, and preparing to oppose the "cruel German and Italian offensive" of democratic countries. The official German newspaper satirized the claim that Germany and Hungary intend to divide Slovakia, saying that this move is intended to urge Britain to quickly reach an understanding with the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Astoundingly Resourceful Newspaper Smuggling Expert: The Secrets of Smuggling <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>In the 20th century, everything is more advanced than before. Take smuggling, for example. In the past, smugglers only dared to act furtively and secretly, but now it's completely different. "Stealing" has become blatant and forceful, with many such enterprises in Europe. Smuggling banned newspapers is a major part of this. Undoubtedly, this is a dangerous activity, punishable by death if discovered.</p>
<p>From the western border of Germany, at least 100,000 anti-Nazi pamphlets are smuggled in every week, organized by a Belgian who is also a graduate of a famous German university. Because of his anti-Nazi beliefs, he was once imprisoned in a concentration camp, but later managed to escape. Now he has become an enthusiastic figure in the newspaper smuggling business, smuggling mostly publications from Paris, Brussels, Prague and other major cities that promote freedom and socialism.</p>
<p>Mr. Pinner, the author of "Black Hell," once accompanied this smuggling expert on a tour of about 200 miles along the border mountain passes, and now he comes to tell you what he saw. In a house in Gelderland, Netherlands, he saw fifty exquisite rectangular packages. About the size of a shoe box, the words marked on the yellow wrapping paper said they were oil cakes for feeding livestock, but in fact, each package contained exactly fifty copies of "Die Zeitung," an eight-page newspaper, the paper of which was extremely small, only seven inches wide and five inches long. Printed in small type on Indian tissue paper, it had all the essentials of a large newspaper. He said, "In Germany, someone once told me that 'Die Zeitung' would give Hitler and his men a headache, more so than the cannons of Britain and France." Those who enthusiastically engage in smuggling are all amateur anti-Nazi comrades. In Germany, they secretly sneak to the border to receive those secret packages and then secretly bring them back. Many hired party members specialize in acting as lookouts and bodyguards. Sometimes, if they are chased too hard by patrols, they have to hide in caves in the foothills or deep in the forests, places so remote that it is simply impossible to find them. After being transported into Germany, they are stored separately in secret cellars. Then, each copy is folded to be only slightly larger than a postage stamp and secretly taken to the city for distribution.</p>
<p>In another area bordering Germany, Pingmin also saw thousands of copies of "Nová Svoboda" - a progressive weekly from Prague, and many copies of "Le Nouveau Front" and "La Bataille Socialiste" published in Paris piled up like mountains. From Friesland to Enton Lands, this 300-mile area has almost become a major base for the world's smuggling business. No less than 250,000 people depend directly and indirectly on this industry for their livelihoods.</p>
<p>There is a similar smuggling business at the border between Italy and Switzerland: three kinds of anti-fascist newspapers, "Grido del Popolo," "Giustizia e Libertà," and "Libertà," are mostly smuggled through the Alpine passes. These newspapers are first printed like ordinary four-page newspapers, and then reproduced photographically on extremely thin rice paper, then folded into a delicate little square, less than half the size of a playing card; but inside, they clearly print tens of thousands of words of shocking news. In addition, two smugglers once smuggled a thousand copies of "Giustizia e Libertà" into Italy, hidden in the lining of their belts. When crossing the heavy mountain passes, the newspapers were hidden in hollowed-out sleds and the thick soles of boots.</p>
<p>On June 11 last year, Professor Lods, the editor-in-chief of "Grido del Popolo" in Paris, was assassinated in Bagan, generally believed to have been done by the henchmen of the fascists. Although the French police authorities found many facts proving that it was a politically motivated assassination, the murderer ultimately escaped.</p>
<p>"Grido del Popolo" has always been smuggled into Italy by stuffing goods into the stomach. Not long ago, about 10,000 copies were sandwiched in a batch of soap, transported from France by ordinary freight trains. The soap is a common commodity in Italian households, and each newspaper is hidden under the "how to use soap" leaflet. When people open the wrapping paper, they see the tiny folded newspaper, which contains a great deal of real news from Abyssinia and Spain, and other unexpected news, all of which the Fascists want to cover up.</p>

<p>The mysterious death of the beautiful Jin Bei'er on Peking Road, Kowloon on Sunday is becoming more and more mysterious. At first, it was thought to be a wronged ghost under the wheels, then it was feared to be from beating, and now it has become a wronged soul falling from a height. Moreover, it also involves Filipina girls. It looks quite strange, romantic, and tortuous. However, Hong Kong detectives have always been known for their ability, and I think they will soon be able to get to the bottom of this strange case. However, we think this is locking the stable door after the horse is stolen and is quite laborious. Speaking of it, it is that set again. We hope that the authorities can send more patrolling police officers, so that the moment of Jin Mu'er's death was already clear at a glance, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many thefts that occurred in one day, with a total of three. If the above requirements are met, the authorities can increase the number of patrols, then killing two birds with one stone will reduce the number of robberies, maybe even to zero. Isn't that happy? May our hopes not be in vain!</p>

<p>— Tan Xiaopei</p>
<p>When it comes to Peking Opera, the three generations of the Tan family must be mentioned. Among the three generations of grandparents, Xinpei need not be mentioned, and Fuying is still popular, but Xiaopei, who is in the middle, has neither been uniquely favored by heaven, nor has he benefited from the legacy of his ancestors, and he does have a bit of a suspicion of being a mere place filler. In the old capital, when asked who is best at playing Lü Boshe, it is Xiaopei. Because when Xinpei used to play Chen Gong catching and releasing, Xiaopei played Lü Boshe. Now that Fuying is playing Chen Gong catching and releasing, Xiaopei still plays Lü Boshe. With more than 40 years of experience, he can only be publicly recommended for the role.</p>

<p>— By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous excerpt: In 1914, when the European situation was tense, the German-American shipping line's "Kronzprinz Wilhelm" carried six million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the radio operator of the Cox Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Roumon Garot. At the same time, Jack made friends with Boffa, the German radio operator on the ship. Jack was working in place of Boffa, receiving a strange message...</p>
<p>"Now, let's not worry about that first," Jack interrupted, "Take this report to Captain Locke immediately, send it yourself, don't go through anyone else's hands. If the passengers find out, they will panic immediately."</p>
<p>Boffa, still with his eyes and mouth wide open, quickly went to do his errand.</p>
<p>"Captain Locke is probably coming out soon," Roumon Garot said. "He will call us all out, we had better go out now, but before that, we must not publicize it. There are more than two thousand passengers on this ship, if they know there are two warships chasing us, that's terrible!"</p>
<p>Three - Aimless Running</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, Jack was lying on a chair on the deck, still studying the shocking news he had just heard in his mind. An attendant walked up to him and cautiously leaned in and said, "Captain Locke is in the radio room and wants to see you immediately. Please go!"</p>
<p>"What's going on now?" Jack wondered. He walked towards the radio room, speculating, "I think it must be because I took over the radio without permission. Poor Boffa, I must find a way to keep him from being blamed. I am a passenger now, and the shipowner can't do anything to me."</p>
<p>He thought as he stepped into the radio room. Captain Locke was a tall man with a shrewd appearance and a large, handsome beard. Also in the room were a sailor and Hayes Boffa, who was terrified and looked like he had been reprimanded. As Jack walked in, the captain's tall body was still swaying in front of him.</p>
<p>"You are the one who took over the radio for this good-for-nothing, letting him go out to chew salty biscuits with people, right?" he asked Jack sternly, but there was a strange light in his eyes.</p>
<p>Jack calmly nodded, admitting that he had taken over the management of the machine when Boffa went out to stretch his legs. He was prepared to accept the German's tirade against him. But, unexpectedly, the captain patted him on the back. "Good!" he shouted; "You did very well, otherwise, this good-for-nothing would not have covered this machine, and the British cruiser would have come to check us. Now, I want to discuss with you, you are a radio operator. Our other operator is sick, and now, there must be someone sitting in the room at all times, would you like to take this position?"</p>
<p>Jack was speechless. This proposal was too sudden and he found it difficult to decide for a moment.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to help until China?" he asked.</p>

<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The South China Southern Tour Football Team, after moving to Saigon, although in the first battle, they defeated Nanqi B with a score of three to two, but in the second battle, they were defeated by Nanqi A with a score of three to five. The previous shame has not been avenged, and they have suffered another disastrous defeat. The local overseas Chinese are very disappointed with it. It is found that the reason for South China's defeat is that the formation is not appropriate, and Yang Shuiyi is forced to serve as the left wing, and the performance is useless. The front line is too much of the whole ball, and they often lose opportunities to win. However, it is also because the other party's skills are outstanding and seem to be better than South China.</p>
<p>Team leader Mo Qing, in view of the fact that the army has just arrived in Saigon and has suffered unfavorable losses, there are still many powerful enemies in the future, and he is sincerely afraid that it will be difficult to achieve good results. He also feels that the front line lacks talents and the shooting skills are mostly uncertain. Therefore, he thinks of Li Huitang, who is still in the rear. If he can rush to the team midway, he will lose at Dongyu and gain at Sangyu. It is not too late, so yesterday he sent a telegram back to Hong Kong, asking Huitang to quickly take a plane to Rangoon to join the team.</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, Huitang told reporters that he was too busy with official duties to take leave, and it was difficult to comply with team leader Mo's request.</p>
<p>According to another news, Java originally invited South China to compete, but it must be conditioned on Huitang accompanying the expedition. Java now knows that Huitang cannot go with the weak team, so it has cancelled the previous appointment and invited the Indian team to this competition instead (Football Field Tai Sui)</p>

<p>— Pan Congshao</p>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Rowing a boat is not a trivial matter. It takes some time to practice to be able to operate it freely. How to use oars, sculls, and poles to propel the boat forward, and how to control the direction of its progress. Although there is more than one way to row a boat, what learners practice is nothing more than these two points.</p>
<p>For the sake of easy understanding and practice, the practice of rowing a boat starts with the sampan driving of propelling a boat forward with a single oar. This has already been published in this column. What is recorded in this article is the practice of using two oars.</p>
<p>The power of pushing the boat forward with two oars is greater than that of a single oar, because the greater the pushing force, the greater the resistance against the water. Moreover, simultaneously and sequentially taking care of the use of two oars is a difficulty that beginners feel has not been experienced in the process of practicing single oars. Secondly, using two oars, while paddling to make the boat go forward, also doing the action of the direction of the boat, that is, not causing the boat's speed to decrease greatly due to the use of two oars as rudders, is not easy to do.</p>
<p>When rowing a foreign boat with two oars, if it is not a single-person action, there should be a person in charge of the rudder. Beginners should take this opportunity to gradually become proficient in the use of arm strength and the grip of the hand on the boat. As for multi-person rowing with two oars, the boat's speed will lose its lasting uniformity due to the improper driving of one of them.</p>
<p>One person operates two oars, and the directions of the two oars are the same at the same time. The driver sits in the boat, facing the opposite direction of the boat. When the body bends forward and both hands protrude forward sharply, the two oars held in the hands have already been flipped out of the water, passing over the surface of the water and pushing backward. When both hands are dragged backward, the two oars re-enter the water. In order to increase the resistance of the oar against the water, the body must lean backward in the middle of changing the oar to paddle the water forward. When the two oars that are being paddled forward are dragged out of the water, the body returns from tilting to facing forward. In this way, holding the oar handles with both hands and pushing forward, that is, the two oars cross the surface of the water and push backward, drag backward, and the changing oar in the water paddles forward, the power of the boat is naturally generated from the action of the oar paddling forward against the water.</p>
<p>Soon, the skin of the palm that grips the oar will feel strenuous due to the use of rowing, and it is easy to break. This suffering is not difficult to endure. On the other hand, beginners with little strength will feel tired in their arms after not even dozens of rowing strokes, and they will not be able to maintain the same forward and backward position of the two oars in the water and on the surface of the water. It becomes chaotic.</p>
<p>When using a changing oar, its fulcrum should be where the oar touches the side of the boat, the hand holding the end of the oar is the point of force, and the part of the oar blade that resists the water is the point of emphasis. When the point of emphasis generates the effect of pushing the boat forward, you can pay attention to the direction of the blade surface against the water, and do not tilt it, of course, it cannot be directly facing the water. In each process of the two oars paddling forward from the back, do not sink too deep. The angle between the oar blade and the vertical line must always be maintained below 30 degrees, but at the beginning of the oar blade leaving and entering the water, try to increase the angle, which can reduce the resistance of the oar against the water, and also avoid the method of wasting hand strength. It is worth paying attention to avoid both disadvantages.</p>
<p>When changing direction in the boat, it is easy to do with the force of the two oars paddling the water. For example, if you want to turn left, the right oar resists the water, that is, its gravity is slightly strengthened. If you need to turn sharply or make a large turn, the left oar stops completely, and the gravity of the right oar is particularly large, then you can achieve it. The action of taking care of the direction while rowing with two oars is not very difficult, but it is difficult to maintain a straight forward direction. This must be done. The gravity of using two oars must be uniform in the progress of the boat. Generally, people's left and right hands have some differences in strength, and because the position of the two oars in the water or on the surface of the water cannot be consistent, the difference in gravity is even greater, which makes the forward direction of the boat unable to maintain a straight course.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Expectations for Contributors to the Supplement <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>We already know that the responsibility borne by supplement editors is significant. However, the establishment of a supplement cannot rely solely on the editor; it also requires submissions from contributors. Moreover, the editor's views are often influenced by the contributors. After all, the editor cannot act unilaterally and stubbornly. An editor working alone, single-handedly managing a supplement, or at most inviting two or three close friends to perform a one-man show, does exist, but this is not proper and not a common occurrence, thus not worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the importance of contributors to a supplement, seemingly even above that of the editor. And since I already have expectations for the editor, I cannot but also have expectations for these contributors.</p>
<p>I hope they will choose the supplement they want to contribute to and not submit randomly. There are many supplements, and while the content and nature of some may be similar, there are also many that differ greatly or do not align with your views, which you must pay attention to. If you submit randomly and go down the wrong path, especially to an outdated, degenerate, or even reactionary supplement, even if they publish your work and offer generous payment, I don't think you will be happy! Furthermore, if you are submitting for the sake of payment, just to get published, then I hope you will be careful with your pseudonym and not use the same one, so that others cannot figure out what kind of writer you really are.</p>
<p>I hope they will not follow behind others. If someone is discussing topic A, don't you also discuss topic A. If someone is describing object B, don't you also describe object B. Your subject matter should always be unique and fresh, never parrot what others say and write stale clichés.</p>
<p>I believe that the universe is vast, and there are countless things in the human world that can be used as material for writing, at my disposal. The saying "inexhaustible and ever-flowing" can be interpreted in this way. As long as you are willing to pay attention at all times and in all places, and cultivate a keen sense of observation, I guarantee you that novel material can be found everywhere. (However, you must not be too curious and get stuck in a dead end.)</p>
<p>I hope they will not cater to the editor's psychology. It seems that contributors catering to the editor's psychology is the most common phenomenon. Some contributors do not seem to focus on improving their own work but instead try to figure out the editor's preferences. This is wrong. I have already said that contributors can influence the editor's views. As long as your work is good, both in content and presentation, even if you have not catered to the editor's tastes, I believe that an editor who is fair and discerning will not bury your hard work. Then, you may even achieve unexpected success. However, if the editor's views are indeed correct, then contributors should not ignore them but rather use various clever writing techniques to promote and expand upon them.</p>
<p>I hope they will consider the environment. Naturally, what I am saying only applies to local contributors at present, because there are various restrictions in this area that contributors need to consider. Otherwise, it will not only be a waste of effort but also harm the newspaper. However, my intention in saying "consider" is not so negative; on the contrary, I mean to consider it actively. We must never forget our current important task, which is to resist the war and build the nation. We must fulfill our responsibilities as writers, using various topics and techniques to write unified articles that promote the movement to resist the war and build the nation. I firmly believe that the pen of a writer is indeed omnipotent, and the oppression of a particularly harsh environment cannot prevent the emergence of particularly proactive articles!</p>
<p>Besides these hopes, of course, I also hope that every contributor will not write boring texts, accusatory texts, or any texts that harm others without benefiting oneself or even harm oneself. I think that proper contributors are certainly well aware of these things, so there is no need for my verbose reminders.</p>
<p>However, what I have said above is addressed to a mature contributor. By "mature," I mean that their thoughts, views, and writing skills are all above the average level. If I were addressing an immature contributor—in other words, a contributor whose thoughts, views, or writing skills are still very naive in some aspect—I would have different expectations.</p>
<p>I hope that such contributors will immediately stop submitting! Of course, I understand their interest or their self-importance. However, at a time when the entire nation is focused on saving the country, I believe that everyone should be able to use their strengths to directly contribute to the cause of national salvation. Since you are not confident in your submissions, why waste your energy and resources? You can reserve your interest and self-importance for after the victory, when the world is at peace, and then slowly satisfy them. As for some immature contributors who complain about not getting published, either blaming heaven and earth or criticizing the editor for being blind and selfish, or repeatedly seeking favors to get their face shown in the newspaper, I think that is especially unacceptable. I hope that in addition to stopping immediately, they will also sincerely repent!</p>
<p>Perhaps general contributors will feel dissatisfied with my expectations, saying that I intentionally wronged them. I hope they will appreciate my sincerity: I have no other intention than to hope that they will have proper and outstanding development. Moreover, I myself am also a contributor, and I am using these expectations to encourage myself!</p>

<p>— Mingzhi</p>
<p>——Grandma's Story——</p>
<p>"Oh, it's been a while since I've seen you; how come you're here again today?" Li Jingen at the teahouse exclaimed as soon as he saw the old grandma.</p>
<p>The old grandma was still the same, with a shallow basket in her arm, selling beans.</p>
<p>"After I sold the beans last time, I went back home to get more; unexpectedly, just as I was about to come back, I heard that things were a bit uneasy in town, and I was too scared to come until now. I inquired and found out that things are mostly calm, so I came back to do business."</p>
<p>"Not only was it uneasy, I almost lost my life!" Li Jingen said with emotion.</p>
<p>He had the common habit of farmers in the countryside, exaggerating the things he encountered, especially the dangerous ones. According to him, the night the troops stormed the town, he slipped out the back door and, under a rain of bullets, crawled for a long time before he managed to escape with his life. However, he said that he had taken a bullet to the thigh and still had trouble walking.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he pulled up his trousers to show the old grandma. Sure enough, there was a bandage on his left leg, but it was impossible to know what kind of injury he had sustained.</p>
<p>"If 'they' hadn't treated me quickly the next day, I'm afraid this leg would have been useless. 'They' are actually good to people."</p>
<p>The old grandma smiled and said, "Yes, it could be like that."</p>
<p>At this time, some of the teahouse customers had already heard Li Jingen's story and didn't express much after hearing his words. But some were here for tea for the first time today, and after hearing him, they couldn't help but come over to take a look, each offering some comments.</p>
<p>Li Jingen was still talking non-stop about what happened that night, not only describing it vividly as if it were happening before their eyes but also interspersing it with many remarks about how good "they" were and how "they" did this and that.</p>
<p>"Please eat some yellow sand beans to replenish yourself," the old grandma said as she saw him talking non-stop, scooping a handful from the basket and placing it on the table. "These are lotus seeds for beggars, good for people who have been injured."</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot, I still owe you for the beans!" Li Jingen said as soon as he saw the beans. "How much is it? I'll give it all to you today."</p>
<p>"Haha," the old grandma laughed, "You forgot about the bean money, but I forgot about your shoes!"</p>
<p>"I went to Li Jiaqiao a few days ago and went to your house. Your wife said that she received the money you brought back and that she knew I would come here to sell beans. She could see you, so she asked me to bring you a pair of shoes."</p>
<p>"Then where are the shoes?"</p>
<h3 id="e54">"The Gates of Hell" <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Zhaojun</p>
<p>Jin Zhengqi has been without an "official" position for eighteen years, if you count them on your fingers. This long and difficult journey has filled his hollow and rough belly with the resentment of being "an unrecognized talent"—he often took a palm-leaf fan, sat at the gate of the Jin family ancestral hall, crossed his right foot over his left, and vehemently cursed the government that didn't value intellectuals for being terrible and useless. Or—he would use the handle of the fan to strike the ground hard, loudly singing lines from operas like "Talent is rejected by a mediocre ruler, integrity alienates old friends!"</p>
<p>Since February of this year, when Jin Zhengqi's hometown—Tang County—fell, he had been blessed with official luck due to the changing times. He no longer sang Beijing opera at the entrance of the ancestral hall. From the 22nd, he went to work every day in a flat-roofed house with a corner blown off by artillery fire. This place was formerly the site of the county government.</p>
<p>He was truly a little carried away. The joyful mood of the past few days replaced the depression of more than ten years. He sat smiling in his armchair, his left leg still comfortably crossed over his right, black lacquer on the desk in front of him, pasted a big red strip of paper he wrote in person, neatly encrusted with the words "General Affairs Director Seat" five dark purple characters, plus a big exclamation mark below.</p>
<p>But happiness doesn't last long, the troubles that come are many.</p>
<p>One day, a stern-looking armed officer came to the maintenance association, stroking his mustache and lightly asking:</p>
<p>"Which one is Director Jin?"</p>
<p>"That would be me." A ninety-degree bow, his "integrity" not very "upright".</p>
<p>"So it's you?" The officer rolled his eyes at him. His voice getting a bit rougher, "Listen up! By eight o'clock tomorrow morning, send fifty pretty girls to the military headquarters for 'use'! They must be top-notch, understood?"</p>
<p>"Reporting, officer, almost all the pretty girls in our county have run away. It's certain that we can't find fifty, and..."</p>
<p>"Bullshit!" A thunderous roar cut him off, "You're really useless, if you don't send them on time tomorrow, watch out for your dog life! My words are as hard as diamonds!" The officer said in one breath! With a "swish" he turned around and strode away, his footsteps heavy, hitting Jin Zhengqi's heart one after another.</p>
<p>"Alas! It's hard not to be an official, but it's even harder to be one!" Jin Zhengqi slowly walked back to the office, looked around as if there was no one, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>"Ha... ha! Since you know it's difficult to be an 'official', then why did you come?" A wanton laugh startled him, and he turned his head to look. It was the clerk Gu Mutian who worked in the same office.</p>
<p>"Haha! Then why did you come?" Jin Zhengqi said awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Me? Alas! You don't know about me, I was forced to do it with a gun to my head, it wasn't my own free will! To tell you the truth, I am a citizen who escaped from Shanghai, and I ran here thinking I could work in peace, but unexpectedly, a week later, our troops retreated. I took one step too slow and was caught here to write these conscience-erasing notices, for the sake of my life there's nothing I can do, it's really 'when you pass under someone else's eaves, you can't help but lower your head'."</p>
<p>"Hey! Keep your voice down, it's not a joke if people hear these words. I'll discuss something with you. Today the regimental commander ordered me to send fifty women to the military headquarters by eight o'clock tomorrow morning, where can I find them in a place like this ruin, Mr. Gu, would you be willing to help me?"</p>
<p>"Anything else is fine, but I'm sorry about this. I remember the night before last, I was having tea at Fu Lai, and more than a dozen guerrillas sneaked in. They stood up and gave speeches, urging everyone not to send their beloved sisters to the vicious enemies!" Gu Mutian said, then said "goodbye" and left.</p>
<p>The next day, Jin Zhengqi tied up twelve green-faced women and sent them to the military headquarters to hand them over, when he came out the sides of their cheeks were marked with red slap marks. From then on, he hated his master very much, and felt that Gu Mutian's words were very good, and the two became good friends.</p>
<p>One evening.</p>
<p>The north wind angrily struck the trees, the sky had no moon, and no stars, the chest of the soil was pressed down by darkness, the surroundings were eerily quiet, only the sound of a river, moaning softly.</p>
<p>In a corner of Tang County, after a burst of tight gunfire, a majestic song shook the area——"Arise! You who do not want to be slaves!" breaking through the dark curtain of the sky,</p>
<p>Next to the Security Maintenance Association, two figures stood in a small alley, their hands clasped together, one saying:</p>
<p>"Brother Jin, the time has come, I'm going back to my team! I hope you can come soon, and we can be together again." The other said:</p>
<p>"Mutian! Go, run into the arms of your own people! That is heaven—there is sunlight; there is spring. Alas! I, I am still knocking on the 'Gates of Hell'!"</p>
<h3 id="e55">From Chengdu to Xi'an <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>4. The Difficulty of the Shu Road</p>
<p>The car crawled slowly like a reptile, with every passenger experiencing hysterical psychological abnormalities, mired in illusions of danger and safety. Suddenly, I remembered the lines from Tang poetry: "The Shu Road is difficult. More difficult than ascending to the blue sky!"</p>
<p>Now that I am walking on this Shu Road that is "more difficult than ascending to the blue sky," I truly experience the reality of these lines. It is said that modern science is advanced, roads have been opened, and cars can be used to traverse it in a few hours; in the past, walking on foot would take half a month or a month. So, where exactly is the difficulty of this "Shu Road, Shu Road" difficult road? It's none other than the first pass of Western Qin!</p>
<p>5. A Night in Ningqiang</p>
<p>At 3:30 in the afternoon, the car arrived in Ningqiang. Because the road was difficult to travel, it was feared that it would not reach Hanzhong, so it was decided to stop here.</p>
<p>Ningqiang County is larger and more "prosperous" than Mianyang and Guangyuan. I got off the car, dragging my tired body and my two feet that were numb from sitting on the car without being able to stretch, and limped along with my luggage to find a hotel on the street. Following the mud on the road after the rain, after about five minutes, I discovered the red paper sign of "Ningkang Hotel" at the door of a wooden flat house. My soul was attracted to it, and I walked straight towards it. I had a preconceived notion in my mind, that there wouldn't be good hotels in this kind of place anyway, and I was so tired, I just needed to find a place to rest. I stepped through the gate, turned into the middle hall, and stood on the stone steps of the patio. When I looked at it, it was a neat, two-story wooden house, painted very new and dazzling, immediately giving my weary soul infinite pleasure. I asked the tea boy if there were any empty rooms, he said yes, so I decided to stay here. He led me up to the second floor, through the corridor of the middle hall, across a round door, and into the back hall. He opened the doors of two rooms on both sides and said to me respectfully:</p>
<p>"Sir! These are the best rooms."</p>
<p>I decided to stay in the one on the right. The tea boy carried my luggage in.</p>
<p>The room was about fifteen feet square, like it had two wooden beds, an eight immortals table, a rectangular small table, and two round stools. A clothes rack, the cotton bedding on the bed was also clean, and there were two small windows for ventilation. Compared to the inns like latrines in Mianyang and Guangyuan, this could simply be said to be worlds apart.</p>
<p>The four sides of the room were plank walls, painted with white paint. The passersby had inscribed many poems on the plank walls. Here are a few of them:</p>
<p>"One Chengdu to here the road is not flat</p>
<p>Thousands of mountains and valleys rise into the sky;</p>
<p>The mind gallops like lightning without stopping;</p>
<p>The winds and clouds of Western Shu are along the way."</p>
<p>This poem describes the scenery on the road from Chengdu to here, but it is not concrete and profound enough.</p>
<p>"Rongzhou comes here, still a thousand li,</p>
<p>Revitalize the national soul to Chang'an;</p>
<p>Sweep away the traces of the Japanese invaders to quell the hatred,</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would rather die than live on!"</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Diocesan Boys' School Student Strike Remains Unresolved; More Than 120 Students Have Left the School; It is Reported That the Taiwanese Head Prefect Has Resigned to the School <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Diocesan Boys' School student strike remains unresolved to this day. The school authorities reported that the situation remains unchanged, and more than 120 students have left the school. The school authorities have already ordered the students who left the school to return to school for classes yesterday morning, but it is learned that the deadline has been extended to Monday next week. The school authorities have also dismissed seven or eight student leaders who initiated the strike. Currently, most of the students who have left the school are senior students. All students in Class A of the second year, Class A of the third year, and Class A of the fifth year have left the school. Most of the Chinese students in Class B of the third year and Class B of the fifth year have also left the school. It is said that a small number of students returned to school yesterday, but the number of students who left the school was also equal. The rumors about striking students preventing other students from attending classes are not true. Although a small number of students scattered dust on the ground of the school's playground yesterday morning, they did not take any further action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is learned that the Taiwanese head prefect selected by the school authorities has submitted his resignation to the school in view of the fact that the students insist on their opposition, the student strike has been prolonged, and there is no way to break the deadlock and eliminate the dispute, so that another person could be elected to take over. If so, the Diocesan Boys' School student strike, which has been going on for many days, will probably be resolved in the near future, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Number of Homeless People is Increasing Daily: Solving the Root Cause of Homelessness Requires Improving the Lives of the Poor; Rent and Commodity Prices Have a Direct Impact <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>To alleviate the issue of homelessness, the Homeless Relief Association is actively involved, and the authorities have established civilian palaces to provide shelter. The expenses borne by the Hong Kong government are considerable. However, homeless men and women still fill the streets of Hong Kong, with no sign of decrease. In the past, homeless people were only found on major roads such as 大道中 (Dàdào Zhōng - Central Road), 大道東 (Dàdào Dōng - East Road), 大道西 (Dàdào Xī - West Road), Connaught Road, and Des Voeux Road. Now, almost every street has them, even near Caine Road on Aberdeen Street, where there are over twenty homeless people, building makeshift shelters under the eaves of wealthy people's homes. Furthermore, behind a certain house on Seymour Road, some have even built houses to live in. Those concerned with social issues believe that solving the problem of homelessness in Hong Kong requires improving the lives of the poor. Some homeless people rely on finding work near their homeless encampments during the day. If they are moved to a further location, their source of income may be taken away. Even if their job is not taken, living far away means spending time and money on commuting. For these reasons, the homeless are unwilling to move elsewhere. The only way to eliminate homeless men and women is to pay attention to and improve the lives of the poor. The high cost of rent, high commodity prices, and inconvenient transportation all drive the poor to homelessness. According to someone who pays close attention to the homeless population, the number of homeless people has more than doubled in the past two years. The newly homeless are different from the original homeless. They carry luggage, personal belongings, and necessities and sleep under makeshift tents at night, resembling a family. These homeless people are not from the mainland. It is simply due to high rent and commodity prices, as well as the situation where there are more people looking for work than jobs available. Therefore, they hope that the authorities will seriously pay attention to (1) rent problems, (2) commodity price problems, and (3) transportation problems. If the above four problems can be solved effectively, the number of homeless men and women will naturally decrease or even disappear.</p>

No. 5, Gillies Avenue, Western District Robbed by Four Bandits Yesterday Morning; They Knocked on the Door, Claiming to Look for Someone; When the Door Opened, They Rushed in, Used Fake Guns and Scissors to Rob Two Hundred Dollars <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Flat 4, No. 5, Gillies Avenue, Western District, was robbed by four bandits yesterday morning, who broke in with weapons, resulting in a loss of over a hundred dollars before escaping with the stolen goods. According to the victim, Mrs. Feng San (29 years old), who reported the case to the No. 7 Police Station afterwards, at around 9:30 AM that morning, she and her partner were having breakfast when they suddenly heard someone knocking on the door, claiming to be looking for a Mr. Wen (who works at the 大東 (Dàdōng) Printing Company) who lived in the building. Since the visitors could name the person they were looking for, they did not suspect any fraud and opened the door. They then saw four men rushing in. One of them was someone she recognized. After entering, the four men immediately closed the door and pulled out sharp weapons from their pockets, one holding half of a pair of sharp scissors and another holding a child's toy gun, threatening everyone present. Most of the occupants were women and children, and seeing the ferocity of the bandits, they did not dare to shout and allowed them to do as they pleased. The bandits then drove everyone to a corner, gagged them, and tied them up one by one. After everything was arranged, they began to rob, which lasted about twenty minutes, before leaving with the stolen goods, yelling as they went. After the bandits left, they struggled to untie the ropes and called the police. After checking their belongings, they found that $97 in Hong Kong dollars, $50 in Hong Kong silver, $4 in provincial coins, a dart, and a gold dart pendant had been stolen, totaling a loss of $192.20. She requested that the case be filed and investigated. After receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives from the Central and Western Districts to investigate the scene and deployed uniformed and plainclothes officers to patrol the surrounding areas and question passersby.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Chinese Gold &amp; Silver Exchange Society Elected New Officers Yesterday; The Chairman Reported on the General State of Affairs of the Society Over the Past Year; $200 Allocated to Console the Family of Yin Wen <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Gold &amp; Silver Exchange Society held its 28th general meeting of members at the 金陵 (Jīnlíng) Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Two to three hundred members attended, creating a lively atmosphere. The outgoing chairman, Mr. Zhong Daqing, presided over the meeting, conducting the rituals and delivering an opening speech. After the speech, the election of the 23rd board of directors was held, concluding at around 6:00 PM. A banquet was then held to celebrate, and the meeting adjourned late into the night. The chairman's original speech and the election results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Original Speech: Fellow members, today is the 28th general meeting of our society, and we are electing the 23rd board of directors. This is the most important annual gathering. I am very pleased to see so many members participating, both young and old. Looking back to this day last year, I was honored to be elected as chairman with the support of all members. Another year has passed in a flash. During this year, thanks to the guidance of my fellow members and the assistance of my colleagues, I have thankfully managed to avoid making any mistakes. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report on the state of affairs of the society over the past year. Since taking office, my goal has been to rectify the society's administration and to prioritize increasing revenue and reducing expenses. Given the complexity of the society's affairs, I was deeply concerned that even a slight oversight could cause damage to the overall situation. In order to ensure thoroughness in handling matters, I divided the society's affairs into five groups: diplomacy, finance, documentation, general affairs, and investigation, with the current directors working together in their respective areas. All matters related to the society's reforms were discussed and considered with the input of all members. This collective wisdom ensured that all measures were implemented in an orderly manner. Although we have not been able to bring the industry to prosperity, we have been able to maintain the status quo in this extraordinary period of economic downturn and transportation obstruction. This is largely due to the close cooperation and solidarity of the members and executive committee. In the past year, our country has been plagued by continuous warfare, with smoke and fire filling the sky. Farming has been disrupted, businesses have been suspended, and people have been displaced and are in desperate need of help. We urgently hope for assistance from overseas Chinese. As citizens of our country, living in a foreign land, our hearts are with our homeland. We have spared no effort in providing relief to disaster areas, comforting soldiers, and supporting various national salvation movements. For example, the flower-selling fundraiser on July 7th of the 27th year, the donation campaign on August 13th, the collection of raincoats and winter clothing on September 18th, and the personal distribution of relief and comfort to refugees in Pingshan, 浮 (Fú), Fanling, and Shenzhen districts by members of our society this spring, as well as the recent one-dollar donation campaign to repay debts, and the fundraising efforts along the streets in response to the British Relief Association, all achieved remarkable results and were highly praised by the public. In addition, it is worth mentioning the fundraising campaign last year on August 13th to assist the fruit vendors in the Sheung Wan district, which involved many twists and turns and difficulties in the friendly state’s governance. Fortunately, with the patriotic enthusiasm of all members, the campaign was completed, raising a large sum of over several tens of thousands of dollars, which was presented to the central government to strengthen our national defense and was especially commended by the authorities. However, this kind of righteous act is the duty of every citizen, and we dare not claim any credit for it. I am simply reporting it to let people know that our nation has this selfless spirit. As my term comes to an end, I am relieved to be relieved of my responsibilities. I am ashamed of my incompetence and lack of accomplishments. I sincerely hope that the members will elect other capable individuals to take over and revitalize the society's administration. Finally, I would like to express my most sincere wishes for the prosperity of the Chinese Gold &amp; Silver Exchange Society and the happiness of all members.</p>

<p>Campbell, an employee of the China Aviation Machine Trading Company, was found injured in front of the (Cao Jiage Lao) Hotel on Peking Road, Kowloon, at 5:30 AM last Sunday morning and died shortly after. The police authorities are intensifying their investigation into the cause of Campbell's death to determine the truth. According to police investigations, the deceased was seen drinking at the Peninsula Hotel that evening until 2:30 AM on Sunday morning, when he left the hotel accompanied by a</p>
<p>Young Filipino Girl.</p>
<p>At 2:15 AM, the deceased had checked the time in the hotel. After leaving the hotel, he waited for a European friend in a taxi in front of the hotel, intending to go for Chinese food together. They then drove to Shanghai Street and later to a restaurant on Nathan Road. After the meal, the European friend dropped the deceased and his companion off at the (Cao Jiage Lao) Hotel and then said goodbye. According to the woman who accompanied the deceased that night (who resides in the (Cao Jiage Lao) Hotel), she and the deceased parted ways at 4:30 AM that morning and she went back to her room to sleep. The deceased's whereabouts after that are unknown until 5:45 AM that same day, when she was awakened by a neighbor's noise. She went out onto the balcony and peered down at the road, where she saw a man lying on the ground. She recognized him as Campbell and rushed downstairs to hire a rickshaw to report the incident to a close friend of the deceased. They arrived at 6:15 AM. The woman admitted that</p>
<p>The Deceased Left His Coat</p>
<p>in her room. When asked why the deceased, who was usually neatly dressed, would leave without his coat, she replied that it may have been because the deceased was absent-minded and intoxicated, causing him to leave his coat behind. It was also found that the deceased had received $300 last Saturday to pay his West YMCA rent, but the bill had not been paid. During the meal that night, the woman saw him take out one hundred-dollar bill and one ten-dollar bill. According to Detective Inspector Jin Xian, who is in charge of this case, the police authorities have obtained some clues, but nothing has been confirmed. Inspector Jin believes that the injuries sustained by the deceased were caused by a fall from a high place or being hit by a car.</p>

All the photographs participating in this exhibition have never been seen by the public and are sufficient to show the actual situation of our country's war of resistance and national construction. School authorities should pay special attention to this exhibition, as these photos are more likely to reflect the actual situation of our country during the war than any other object. In order to enrich itself and relieve disaster victims, the Chinese Women's Association will charge an admission fee of ten cents per person.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Police Bribery Case Continued Trial Yesterday Afternoon; Sergeant Ives is Suspected of Concealing Facts <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Ruan Zhaoji, a translator from the Hung Hom Police Station, was charged with extorting $110 from Liu Xiyu on April 23rd. Deputy Superintendent Ives was also charged with indirect extortion of $110 from Liu Xiyu on the same day. The case was prosecuted by Government Counsel Mr. Wei and continued to be heard at the Kowloon Magistracy under Judge Qian Si yesterday noon. First, Mr. Ma Qi, a witness for the prosecution, took the stand to answer questions from Mr. Shao Yali, the lawyer representing the first defendant. He stated that those sitting and talking upstairs at the Xie An Club were Ma Han, Zhang Qiang, Liang Jiequan, and eight others sitting in another corner who made the gambling agreement. He then replied to Mr. Wei's questioning, stating that when he identified the first defendant at the police station, he pointed out the person who went upstairs with the plaintiff. Next, Mr. Xi, a member of the Xie An Club, testified that on the night of April 22nd, he attended a banquet at the Da Guan Restaurant. During the banquet, he gambled and won over four dollars from a man he did not know. The man gave him</p>
<p>A Hundred-Dollar Bill</p>
<p>and he gave him change. He then gave the hundred-dollar bill to Ma Qi to exchange it for him. Following this, lawyer Laosibi took the stand, stating that on April 24th, two Chinese men came to his office and reported what had happened to them at the police station. He then advised the men to report to the police authorities. At the same time, he first spoke to Deputy Superintendent Xiufudun on the phone about the general outline of the matter. He replied to Mr. Xiao Zhongshi's questioning, stating that the men had mentioned two police officers from the Hung Hom Police Station, one was a deputy superintendent and the other was a translator, but they did not mention their names. Following this, Deputy Superintendent Xiushidun testified that on the afternoon of April 24th at 4:30, he had spoken to lawyer Laosibi on the phone. As a result, he ordered Detective Haokeng to show him the plaintiff's statement. The following day, the 25th, Mr. Haokeng met with him as scheduled and brought</p>
<p>The Plaintiff's Statement.</p>
<p>At 2:30, Deputy Superintendent Ives also came to see him in his office. He then showed him the statement. However, the defendant returned the statement to him. He then told him that the plaintiff's statement had several characteristics, but the defendant did not answer. He then asked him, "Where were you when the translator Ruan spoke to the plaintiff?" After listening to his words, Ives immediately replied that he was not present at the time. The witness then said that based on his twenty-six years of experience in the police force, if he encountered a case of counterfeit currency, his procedure for handling the case, in his personal opinion, would be to first order the police to search the person. If no counterfeit currency was found, then he would inquire in detail about the person's address, resume, and occupation. If the answers to all the questions were satisfactory, then he would immediately release the person. The police station could decide internally whether or not to prosecute such trivial matters. Also, a British police officer in the position of deputy superintendent must first pass the second-class Cantonese examination. There are currently over two hundred British officers in the police force who have passed the second-class Cantonese examination, twenty to thirty who have passed the third-class Cantonese examination, and only four who have passed the Cantonese examination. According to what the plaintiff said in his statement, every deputy superintendent</p>
<p>Could Understand</p>
<p>the witness. The witness recounted the identification process on April 25th. The first defendant was mixed in with a group of nine Chinese deputies, all of whom were wearing suits. Wu Jiequan, Zhang Qiang, and Ma Qi identified the first defendant, while Ma Pan was unable to identify him. He then answered the questioning of Mr. Shao Yali, stating that after the witnesses finished identifying the person, he asked them when they had seen the first defendant, but the witnesses replied that some said 10:00, some said 10:15, and some said 11:00, all without any hesitation. Next, he answered Mr. Xiao Zhongshi's questioning, stating that based on his meeting with Ives, his impression was that Ives had</p>
<p>Concealed Something.</p>
<p>After Detective Ma Feipa testified to the confession of the second defendant to the court, the judge adjourned the case to be heard again on June 30th at 11:30 AM.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the role of drama in the War of Resistance, but this must rely on the full utilization of artistic forms, using mature, orthodox themes to reflect the reality of the War of Resistance. The positive role of drama is not to be neglected. Our enthusiastic drama colleagues are precisely a group that cannot be ignored. They integrate politics and art, threading them together, turning them into an unyielding force, stirring up the public everywhere, inspiring the public, and fully expressing their combativeness. This can be seen in the results of each charity performance by various theater troupes in the mainland and Hong Kong. This can be seen even more in the joint charity performance of "Before Dawn" at the Lee Theater on the 16th and 17th, tonight and tomorrow, by the Hong Kong-based China Travel, China Art, and China Relief theater groups. If the previous charity performances of the various theater troupes were units of force, then this joint performance is a generation of strength. In the present time of intensifying the promotion of spiritual mobilization, it will definitely have a great effect and achieve the greatest results. We sincerely wish for</p>
<p>Even more, these three theater troupes, after the charity performance, will embark on their respective missions to the mainland or abroad. In this way, they themselves – the playwrights – are like a sharp needle, threading a steel-like line (drama), going around the world to connect every Chinese heart, fighting for the motherland! Therefore, we can also say that this joint charity performance is an expression of the playwrights linking the public and handing over drama to the public, handing over the spirit to the motherland. We pay our respects to them!</p>
<p>What must be mentioned here is "Before Dawn." This play is divided into four excellent independent plays, and these four plays are the most quintessential and outstanding representative works of the past twenty-odd months since the War of Resistance. The content all depicts the touching and inspiring stories before dawn. Although these four plays have different styles and different performances, they all have a very clear theme, which is to use extremely artistic techniques to express a national and ethnic demand – "If you have money, give money, if you have strength, give strength!"</p>
<p>Among these four plays, two of them touch on the theme of contributing money. One is "The Thief," which deeply moved many people during the previous performance by China Relief. The other is the newly staged "Atonement," which persuades people to dedicate their hidden and unused things and wealth to the struggling motherland. Although the themes of these two plays are similar, they have two different flavors in their writing techniques. In addition, "Dawn," written and directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, also uses a touching fact of "giving strength if you have strength" to contrast the "do-nothing attitude" of those who do not give money. "The Performer" uses a tragic experience to move the audience, causing everyone to be vigilant and introspective, and to stand firm to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>The people participating in this joint performance are all the most prestigious first-class drama workers in Hong Kong – and also in the country. The directors are Mr. Ouyang Yuqian and Mr. Jin Shan. The performers (listed in order of the number of strokes in their surnames) include Wang Ying, Li Jingbo, Li Danlu, Jin Shan, Jin Li, Jiang, Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, Ke Gang, Fan Zheng, Sun Zhaoxin, Qin Xiaozhu, Zhang Lide, Tong Yi, Huang He, Yang Wei, Deng Zhujun, Ge Xin, Su Mei, Xiao Ziying, and Su Hui. This group of the most outstanding actors will not be unfamiliar to the audience in Hong Kong and does not need our introduction. As for those who are responsible for the stage design, lighting, costumes, props, and effects in this performance, they are all experienced workers from their respective organizations. Now that the essence is gathered in one furnace, its perfection and greatness are self-evident.</p>
<p>We believe that this performance will definitely let the audience in Hong Kong know the highest form of current drama, and will definitely further calculate the foundation of a new stage of spoken drama. In order to achieve the highest level of theatrical art at the stage, and in order to appreciate the fighting form that is about to arrive at dawn, we must never miss this opportunity. Moreover, all the proceeds from this joint performance will be donated to domestic cultural undertakings, which is an even greater reason for compatriots who love their motherland and love drama to do their best to support it.

<p>On weekdays, Nanjing Road at around eight or nine in the morning appears bustling with activity, with every eastbound public bus or tram crammed full of people. Clerks and staff rush to their offices at this time. However, Sundays have a slightly different feel. Each carriage is quite empty, and the newsboys selling morning papers at the stations aren't shouting with much vigor because everyone recognizes Sunday as a day of rest, a day to get a reward for a week's hard work.</p>
<p>However, for Shanghainese, rest means "having fun." When colleagues meet after work on Saturdays, they'll ask, "Where are you going to have fun tomorrow?" So, Sunday becomes a day for "having fun," and different types of Shanghainese have different places to have fun.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk about something that isn't exactly "having fun." Just by looking at the many yellow churches with pointed spires in Shanghai, one can understand the potential of Christianity in Shanghai. These churches are very active on Sundays. Those pious men and women, regardless of any important matters, must devoutly go to church to pray and listen to the pastor preach doctrine before they can relax because this ritual may include repentance and correction for the past six days.</p>
<p>The U.S. Fourth Naval District in Shanghai also holds prayer services at the Great Shanghai Theatre every Sunday at 10 a.m. The attendance is very crowded, including upper-class Chinese, students, middle-class merchants, and so on. The majority of them are probably thinking "the drinker's heart is not in the wine" because after the naval service, there is an hour of music and singing, which is indeed quite enjoyable. This free enjoyment is enough to make even non-believers willing to sit for two hours. Besides this, perhaps there are other purposes, but I am not aware of the details.</p>
<p>Shanghai has fifty movie theaters and six opera houses, and none of them fail to be full on Sundays. The customers here include gentlemen, students, and the petit bourgeoisie. At the greyhound racing track, people's heads are moving restlessly. Many enthusiasts are immersed here, and winning a few double jackpots is more comfortable than going to the office every day. Inviting a friend to a teahouse for a chat, from the world situation of Zhang Bolun catching a cold in Rome to the disappearance of the Wang family's kitten next door, while enjoying all kinds of snacks you like, is naturally a pleasant thing. If the weather is good, then carrying a camera to the park is an option. Although the price of film has soared terribly, and the park has become a refuge for the upper-class refugees, the park is still a place with trees and grass.</p>
<p>Culture Street has declined pitifully, but on this day, some people still take advantage of their leisure to come and browse. Those doing the same browsing are some wives and children. However, the location is in several famous department stores. They greedily look from here to there, wishing they could bring all their favorite things back home. In fact, the paper bags in their hands can't hold any more.</p>
<p>Dance halls and restaurants are always so crowded on this day that it seems they hope customers won't come, but customers seem to enjoy the crowds and keep coming. Lunch starts before twelve o'clock, and even if Huadiao wine is one yuan per catty, there are still people drinking it.</p>
<p>Some are entertaining themselves, some are reveling, but some are also doing nothing. I immediately saw the latter: Wang Jinbiao, the doorman next door, is still sitting dumbly on the bench by the door, indifferent to Sunday; the young man in the grocery store across the street is also staring blankly at the pedestrians and vehicles on the road...</p>
<h3 id="e72">Casual Chat About Shanghai Evening Newspapers <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Although Shanghai is the sixth largest commercial port in the world, with a population of 3.5 million, and is also the center of the country's economy, culture, and so on, it is shameful to say that the history of evening newspapers in Shanghai is only fifteen years.</p>
<p>The earliest form of evening newspaper that Shanghainese encountered, as far as I can remember, seems to have been after the outbreak of the so-called Qi-Lu War staged by the two major warlords of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the evening newspaper was called the "Southeast Evening News."</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghainese reading newspapers at that time: first, they looked at the theater advertisements, that is, the page that published theater advertisements, the so-called "Theater News." After reading the theater news, second, they looked at the local news. The purpose of reading local news was to diligently search for "social news" with a scandalous flavor in the cracks. Then, they opened the supplement of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School, read humorous articles and romantic novels, and finally checked the main paper to look at the headlines of domestic and foreign events. Naturally, merchants were quite interested in the economic news section, and housewives were perhaps interested in the "big sale" advertisements of all stores. Different people had different information they liked to read, but indifference to the domestic situation and international situation was a very common phenomenon among general newspaper readers in Shanghai fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>The above is the status of general morning newspapers in Shanghai society fifteen years ago. Morning newspapers were like this, so the fate of evening newspapers can naturally be imagined. In addition, Shanghainese at that time did not have the habit of buying evening newspapers, and the Qi-Lu War was outside the concessions of Shanghai. There was no roar of artillery, let alone the high flight of airplanes, so there was no "exciting" coverage. Therefore, after a short process, the evening newspaper was completely disconnected from Shanghai.</p>
<p>At that time, Shanghai children had a very common nursery rhyme about the Southeast Evening News, singing in the streets and alleys... "Southeast Evening News, eat your dinner, not enough capital, go to sleep." It meant that selling evening newspapers was only possible after dinner to make a few big bucks. After dinner, the job was done, and it was time to go to sleep.</p>
<p>After that, until the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the "September 18th" Incident occurred in the Northeast, and the situation changed rapidly. At that time, Shanghainese had experienced a revolutionary process and even recognized the relationship between national affairs and the people. Therefore, the so-called "evening newspaper," which had disappeared for six or seven years, reappeared in Shanghai for the second time in response to the needs of the general public. However, at that time, the evening newspapers were all issued by the original newspapers in Shanghai, so they were generally called "extra editions." After the "January 28th" battle, which followed the "September 18th" Incident, temporarily ended, the general "extra editions" were reorganized into "evening newspapers." However, since there was no strong stimulus from current events, and there was no information on current events that could be used to appeal to the public in the evening newspapers, Shanghainese gradually became less interested in evening newspapers. However, this time, although the general evening newspapers failed to capture or have a large readership, evening newspapers in Shanghai had finally laid a considerable foundation.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, the outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident, followed by the all-out War of Resistance against Japan on "August 13th," began. In the unfolding of this great era, various "evening newspapers" were flying all over the streets of Shanghai. Although the wholesale price of an evening newspaper was only 15 to 25 copper coins, on the most popular days, an evening newspaper could be sold for 6 to 10 cents in the hands of buyers. After the complete fall of Greater Shanghai, evening newspapers became more and more numerous, but the interest of readers was inversely proportional, decreasing day by day. Therefore, recently, even the first-class evening newspapers are only worth one cent after 8 p.m. However, on days when "special good news" is published, they are still very popular with Shanghainese, who compete to be the first to see them. Even if the price temporarily rises to three cents per copy, they are still easy to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Nanjing Road Is Undergoing Changes <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hongtao</p>
<p>Nanjing Road was originally the center of the concession, but now it is the center of the entire Shanghai. The phenomenon of isolated Shanghai can be seen from Nanjing Road. Nanjing Road has undergone many changes in this short period of more than a year. The desolation of Nanjing Road at the beginning of the August 13th battle and the bustling scene of today are two extreme situations that are truly unimaginable. This change is the most special page in the history of Nanjing Road's rise and fall.</p>
<p>Before the war, Nanjing Road was indeed the most prosperous place, but this prosperity was only a superficial appearance of its location. Its internal reality could not conceal the pervasive stagnation. The radios and big sale banners of the stores and the blowing horns and drums only added a little vitality. The times for going to work and getting off work three times in the morning, noon, and evening seemed a bit noisy, but at other times, although pedestrians on the road were constant, the business of the stores was not all thriving. The Taifeng, Ningbo Industrial Bank, Dashengfu, and Dahu Bank, several decent-looking huge buildings, were all empty. But now the situation is completely different. People are constantly crowded from morning to night. On the not-very-long road, countless new stores have been added. The several huge buildings mentioned above now have new owners and have been completely changed. The original site of Taifeng is now Qiu Tianbao Silver Store (there are now two Qiu Tianbao's on Nanjing Road, the one across from Old No. 9 Lun is a branch, and the main store was formerly at Xiaodongmen). The original site of Ningbo Industrial Bank is now Dachang Silk Store, the original site of Dashengfu is now China National Products Company. The building across from the Hongmiao Temple was the Shanghai National Products Company before the war. The various businesses of ××× collapsed, and this building was left empty. After the war, it was opened as a refugee camp, and the building was even more damaged. But now it has become a new building with a cement facade, and its new owner is Fang Jiuxia Silver Store, which has returned to Nanjing Road. The Dahu Building of Dahu Bank has now been changed to New Daxing Building, and the magnificent facade of Xinda Xiang has added infinite excitement to Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>The new stores that have opened on Nanjing Road now are mostly silk stores, silver stores, pharmacies, and ginseng and swallow's nest shops. Among them, the pharmacies have a northern flavor, and the rest of the stores are mostly transferred from Xiaodongmen.</p>
<p>Among the four major companies on Nanjing Road now, the facades of two major companies have been renovated. The first to be renovated was the New World, at the end of the previous year. The Hong Kong-style corridor was changed, and the storefront windows were rebuilt in their original location. The walls of the store were changed to creamy yellow marble, but perhaps the construction was not very careful. After only a short time, the color looked a bit dull. The latter to be renovated was Sincere, which also changed the bottom-level facade to light yellow marble. It seems that it has not been fully completed yet, and all of Sincere's glass-covered corridors have also been changed to cement. This is probably because the previous iron frame was affected by the bombing and could not be completely straightened, so it could only be covered with cement.</p>
<p>The bomb scars on Sincere seem to have completely disappeared, but the author has found a flaw that can never be erased, that is, the two coiled dragon iron pillars that were replaced on the second floor of Sincere, whose coiling posture is the opposite of the original. The original ones coiled upwards, and the current ones coil downwards. This may be a temporary oversight by the workers, but this can truly leave a record of this injury. In the future, if someone repairs the anecdotes of Nanjing Road, this will be one of the major events in the annals of Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>According to insiders, there are currently about 1,000 to 1,500 poor children and unemployed people in Shanghai who make a living by selling evening newspapers. Their daily income ranges from 20 cents to half a dollar. Most of them are people whose homes were destroyed by artillery fire, but their current lives are still maintained by war. Because if the war is declared over, Shanghainese will forget about evening newspapers again, and at that time, it will naturally not be easy for evening newspaper sellers to seek their livelihoods here. But don't look down on them as poor people who only sell evening newspapers, they all have the common awareness that "only when the War of Resistance is won will there be food to eat."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Restaurant Alley <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>In the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai, it is indeed difficult for ordinary poor scholars to solve the four major problems of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Taking "food" alone, although many large restaurants are opened on the road, the golden signs of "Beijing cuisine" and "Cantonese food" only allow the wealthy class to enjoy themselves. Under this urgent need, restaurant alleys have emerged and have maintained their prosperous and lively situation.</p>
<p>Many people may wonder about the origin of the term "restaurant alley." I also asked an "old Shanghainese" over seventy years old. He told me that when he first came to Shanghai, the restaurant alley had already taken shape. In this way, the long history of the restaurant alley has created its current scale, and it has indeed reached its golden age.</p>
<p>Restaurant Alley is the common name for Cichang Lane on Nanjing Road. This is an old-fashioned lane. In addition to connecting to Nanjing Road, it also connects to Jiangxi Road in the west, and there are also two exits on Sichuan Road in the east. Because most of the lane is filled with small restaurants and small noodle shops, it is familiar to everyone. By relying on its "cheap and good" operation, it has attracted countless customers. Inside, there are Cantonese restaurants, local small restaurants, Muslim halal restaurants, "Pork Rib Noodle King" specializing in noodles, Western-style coffee and bread shops, open-air "civilian food stalls," noodle shops baking sesame cakes and fried dough sticks all day long, and sticky rice cake stalls where people can wolf down food... No matter what kind of person comes inside, they can find their favorite food. No matter what kind of person, they will feel that they have exchanged sufficient food for a satisfactory and low price. This is truly the most "joyful" event.</p>
<p>Clerks from foreign firms, students, workers, Indians, patrolmen, impoverished White Russians, and beggars are all regular customers here. University girls in everything from mink coats to high heels and permed hair, to "playboys" in suits and leather shoes, all flock in at noon, and after one group finishes eating and leaves, the waiting group sits down to solve this major problem. If the weather is clear, there are also "private seats" set up in the open air. The entire alley is crowded with people. In one corner, there are many workers eating on the ground, solving the problem of hunger with white rice plus 30 cents of vegetables. Beggars are at the restaurant doorways, buying fish bones and leftover rice for a penny. White Russians are eating vegetables with clumsy chopsticks in coffee shops. Indians are eating hard bread. Everyone is desperately filling their stomachs in order to "live."</p>
<p>Usually, spending 20 cents inside is enough to eat a full meal. An economy meal is 20 cents, plain noodles are 5 cents, a bowl of white rice is 60 cash, and tofu soup is 260 cash. Being a bit more aristocratic, spending 30 cents is enough to eat to your heart's content. In addition, there are stalls selling oranges at the doorways. Buying a Tianheshan honey orange for 3 cents and eating it all the way back truly makes people feel a little blissful.</p>
<p>The restaurant alley is praised. In this era of expensive rice and firewood, it is indeed a good companion for the poor class. Although the light inside is dim, the air is polluted, and it is far from the scenery of the high-rise buildings of large hotels, it still gives people a satisfying enjoyment. Its fame and prosperity are certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<h3 id="e75">Overseas Vessels Sailing From the Port of Shanghai Change Place Names for Customs Clearance <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Most Other Ports Have Stopped Sailing</p>
<p>A notice from the Japanese customs commissioner of the Jianghai Customs stated that starting June 1st, vessels sailing from nine ports in the Jianghai area must obtain permission from the Japanese Navy and Army in advance, obtain a permit, and also obtain the approval of an additional customs commissioner before being allowed to clear customs. On the 3rd, the Wantong, a British-owned Taikoo company vessel, was refused customs clearance due to not having completed the above procedures, resulting in one suspension of service. On the 5th, Haimen and Qidong were changed to Qinglong Port, and Sanhe Port before customs clearance and sailing was permitted. However, it was reported that inland port vessels cleared customs as usual. The customs authorities decided to comply with customs regulations and maintain administration in response to the Japanese customs commissioner's obstruction of vessel customs clearance. It is now learned that the customs authorities do have the intention of maintaining this, but it is difficult to cope under these special circumstances. The incident of the Wantong vessel being blocked from customs clearance last Saturday already shows the difficulties of the customs authorities. It was also reported that although the Japanese customs commissioner's notice stated that vessels sailing to nine ports, including Haimen, Qidong, Funing, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, must have a permit issued by the Japanese Navy authorities, and the relevant permits and customs declarations must be signed by the Japanese customs commissioner before being cleared for sailing, all foreign shipping companies had not complied as of yesterday. The reporter also knows that the shipping companies have indeed not complied, but the reason for not complying is because they have not dispatched ships to the prohibited ports, so there is no need to comply. As for the Taikoo company's Niuzhuang vessel, which was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Xiamen on the 6th, also stopping at Xinghua and Quanzhou, was later changed to sail to the Northern Seas. Yesterday afternoon, it loaded more than 10,000 bags of flour, more than 300 pieces of cotton yarn, and groceries to Qingdao and Tianjin. Although changing routes is common for shipping companies, it is not surprising. However, the Niuzhuang vessel's dispatch to the prohibited areas of Xinghua and Quanzhou was just after the Wantong vessel was blocked from customs clearance, so the Niuzhuang vessel's change of route is different from usual and may be slightly related. It was also said that although the names Haimen and Qidong are no longer used for vessels sailing to Beisha, customs clearance has not been signed by the Japanese customs commissioner. It can be seen that the purpose of the prohibition is in the names. Since the vessels do not use the names Haimen and Qidong, they will naturally not be obstructed.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Copper Coin Shortage in Shanghai, Buying Scrap Copper and Iron <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Exchange Shops Experiencing Financial Difficulty</p>
<p>Although the financial situation in Shanghai has been prolonged by the war, it has remained stable as a rock and its credit has been outstanding due to the sufficient reserves of the National Government. However, a sudden shortage of copper coins has occurred in the market, and the exchange places are also affected by this, making it difficult to maintain and causing financial difficulties. Even the transportation vehicles, which are usually full of copper coins, are sometimes panic-stricken and have to use banknotes instead. This shows that the Shanghai copper coins are obviously being manipulated or even secretly hoarded, resulting in a sharp decline and shortage. It is hoped that the silver and money industry in this city will pay close attention to this, uphold integrity, and maintain the people's livelihood. At the same time, it is learned that the Japanese puppets have been actively collecting scrap copper and iron in the Jiangnan area in recent months, transporting them to Shanghai for storage. A warehouse has been prepared near the puppet "Fish Market" outside the Bund on Qiwupu Road, totaling no less than 10,000 tons, waiting to be transported to Japan in batches. As for the purchasing agencies, they are densely distributed everywhere, dispatching unscrupulous lackeys to entice ignorant residents to sell their old iron tools, resulting in an increasing scarcity of old copper and scrap iron.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Date of Establishment of Northern Suzhou River Police District Undetermined <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Candidate for Police Chief Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>The Zilin News reported that the Japanese-language mainland newspaper in Shanghai reported on the 31st that a new police district will be established on the north bank of the Suzhou River, named "E" District, to be headed by a newly appointed Japanese assistant police chief. According to a senior official of the Public Works Department, this has been partially confirmed. However, the official stated that many proposals discussed by the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities since March of last year, the establishment of this new police station is only one aspect. In addition, according to another source, the new district may include the Dixiwei Road and Jiaxing Road districts. However, the official stated that the Public Works Department did not issue this regarding the appointment of a Japanese police officer from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to this new position. The Japanese authorities may have already determined someone in mind for this new position, but have not yet discussed this with the Public Works Department. The Japanese newspaper's prediction that the new district will be established in mid-June is also premature. Although negotiations have been going on for fifteen months, they have not been formally agreed upon.</p>

<p>Numerous Arbitrary Taxes and Fees</p>
<p>Various arbitrary taxes that have already been levied in Zhabei, Hongkou, Yangshupu, and other places, such as setting up factories and workshops, opening shops and businesses, and retaining the remaining burnt residences, must be registered with the puppet "Social Affairs Bureau" and pay various registration fees and taxes. Recently, so-called household registration taxes and seasonal taxes have been added to the above-mentioned industries and residents. The general residents who moved to Zhabei are mostly poor people who could not maintain their livelihoods due to the high rents and other expenses in the concessions. Some are even unable to afford food, so they all refuse to pay.</p>

<p>Pedestrians Must Walk Within White Powder Lines</p>
<p>In order to maintain pedestrian safety, the French Concession authorities have ordered the police to post red and green slogans on major roads to advise pedestrians to be careful when walking. They have also marked pedestrian lanes with white powder at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue du President Haig, and stationed police to advise pedestrians on how to walk when the traffic lights are on, requiring them to walk within the white powder lines, otherwise they will be reprimanded.</p>

<p>Risk of Contagious Diseases</p>
<p>Recently, rickshaws have often been found carrying patients in the French Concession. The French police authorities believe that this poses a risk of contagious diseases to public health and it is necessary to strictly prohibit this. A statement has been issued as follows: "It has been found that rickshaws often carry patients in this city. This is prohibited by the rickshaw regulations promulgated by the Public Works Department. Therefore, the French police station specially draws attention to this prohibition to avoid the risk of contagious diseases. In the future, if rickshaws are found carrying patients, in addition to revoking the license, the owner will be fined and bear the cost of disinfecting the vehicle."</p>
<h3 id="e81">Birthday Banquet Turns Into a Brawl Over the Bill <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Birthday Woman Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Wang Yehong, a native of Dongtai, and his son, Wang Baosheng, held a 40th birthday celebration for Wang Yehong's wife, Wang Yangshi, on the 31st of last month. They sent out invitations and booked ten tables of 6-yuan dishes at the Fuxingyuan Huizhou restaurant on Route Cardinal Mercier. In the evening, guests gathered, but the dishes were not enough, so they added another table, for a total of eleven tables. After the guests dispersed at 9 p.m., the bill was settled. The dish price plus the tip was 3 yuan, for a total of 69 yuan. However, Ms. Yang's side only agreed to pay 58 yuan, and insisted on deducting the remaining amount. The restaurant refused because the difference was too large. After several arguments, Wang's side gradually increased the payment to 68 yuan, but insisted on deducting 1 yuan for the tip, and was unhappy in their hearts and spoke rudely, leading to a conflict. Then they started fighting. Shao Shetiao, a 24-year-old Anhui native in charge of the coal stove at the restaurant, was holding an iron rod to poke the coal in the coal stove. Seeing this situation, he felt injustice and ran out with the iron rod and struck Ms. Wang Yangshi's buttocks. Because the iron rod was blunt, half of the left side of her buttocks was punctured. Furthermore, because she was pulled, the wound was lengthened to about three inches, and blood flowed like a fountain. When Ms. Wang Yangshi's husband and son saw Shao wielding an iron rod, they stepped forward and beat Shao. Shao Zhongqian, the restaurant's accountant, and apprentices Shao Zhongpu and Fang Zhongbing, and cooks Wu Zhitang and Huang Er, rushed out to mediate, and a brawl broke out, damaging doors and windows. Afterwards, Wang reported to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Shao Shetiao, Shao Zhongqian, Shao Zhongpu, Fang Zhongbing, Wu Zhitang, and Huang Er, a total of six people, confiscated the murder weapon, an iron rod, and a wooden door bolt, and took them to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Registration Certificates for Da Mei and Zhong Mei Newspapers Returned <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Da Mei Morning Post to Become a Weekly</p>
<p>It is now learned that the registration certificates of the American-owned Zhong Mei Daily and Da Mei Morning Post, which were revoked by the Public Works Department two weeks ago, have been returned. Zhong Mei Daily is scheduled to resume publication today. Da Mei Morning Post, because the person in charge of the newspaper has no intention of resuming normal publication immediately, will change its procedure and issue a weekly publication under the name of Da Mei Weekly. As for the British-owned Shanghai Times, which suspended publication for two weeks, it was originally scheduled to resume publication on the 2nd. It is now learned that the newspaper has changed the date to the 5th because it still has some arrangements to make in terms of business.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Car Number One and Driver Number One <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that a car driving on the roads of Shanghai must have a "license plate." The most recently issued car "license plates" must exceed number 10,000, which indicates that there are at least ten thousand cars in Shanghai. These include privately owned cars, taxis, privately owned transport vehicles, and for-hire transport vehicles. The distinction between private cars and taxis can be seen on the "license plate"; the former has white characters on a black background, while the latter has black characters on a white background. As for the distinction of transport vehicles, those privately owned also have white characters on a black background, while those for hire have white characters on a yellow background.</p>
<p>Every day we see car license plate numbers in the tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands, both above and below. However, we have never seen a car with license plate number one. So, does license plate number one exist? Yes, it does! It is said that the owner of the license plate is named Zhou. This license plate number one was issued as early as the beginning of the Republic of China, which shows that the Zhou family was already very wealthy back then. Of course, there is only one of these earliest license plate number one. There will never be a second one, so it is very valuable. Its owner also regards it as a rare treasure, believing it brings them a lot of prestige. However, the car bearing this license plate number one is already an "old car," so it is now kept in the garage and never taken out. The owner of this "old car," in order to keep license plate number one, has never missed a quarterly payment; otherwise, the license plate number one would be revoked by the vehicle administration office.</p>
<p>Not just anyone can drive a car. Car drivers all have a driver's license. This type of driver's license must be obtained after passing two rigorous examinations. Currently, driver's licenses have been issued to over twenty thousand. It is said that the person who obtained the first driver's license was nicknamed Little Mei Lang. His name is unknown. Little Mei Lang passed away long ago. During his lifetime, he drove a car for the wealthy Jewish businessman Hardoon. At that time, there was also a story related to car license plate number one:</p>
<p>Because Hardoon only had driver number one but no car number one, he once asked someone to speak to the Zhou family, willing to pay a large sum of money to purchase their car license plate number one. The Zhou family humorously replied, "Hardoon wants car license plate number one because he has driver number one, preparing to have two number ones; while we have car license plate number one. Since Hardoon already has driver number one, then we would rather pay a special wage to hire a driver number one..." The result, of course, left Mr. Hardoon with regret in his grave. In Shanghai, scheming over car license plates is also a common phenomenon, such as similar number positions or consecutive numbers. This is probably the so-called "decorative beauty," right? At the same time, there are indeed some people who use riding in a car as "decorative beauty," but in reality, they are "empty big shot officials."</p>
