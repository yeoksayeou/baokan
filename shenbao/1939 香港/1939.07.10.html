<h3 id="c1">日×政策的再檢討 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日×首相平沼，於七月六日發表談話，歷叙日×政府對内對外政策，但最主要的是以下幾點：</p>
<p>第一，强化防共樞軸。他說：『强化防共協定問題，爲旣定方針，今　亦必循遵此方針前進。德國納粹大會，日本或將派遣代表列席』。日×所以依然緊抱住這一「防共」的魔杖，正說明了日×本身困難的日趨嚴重，無法解决，而不得不藉此「防共　的魔杖，一方面加緊和德意的勾結，獲得德意兩國在西方實行政治上與軍事上的協助；另一面則用以迷惑英美等民主　平的列强，尋覓妥協的途徑，分化反侵略陣線，削弱援華制日力量。</p>
<p>第二，對於反侵略各國的態度，平沼談話中卽表現出日×最近政策的矛盾和狡詐。他對美國，是採取誘惑的手段，甚至厚臉說：「美國空氣轉佳，可以察到。」不過事賓上日×在遠東侵掠勢力的發展，他和美國利益的矛盾亦日益增加，不下於他和英國的衝突，這一點，雖然美國少數孤立派和軍火商人故意抹煞，但事實還是事賓，美國終將鄙棄此　　的秋波媚眼而採取自衞步驟的。其次，日×對蘇，平沼說：『諾門罕事件，日本只圖驅逐越境之蒙軍，此外無他，』這更　白表現出日本侵掠者的無恥與無力！他一面大言不慚的反共，一面却對於在共產黨領導下加日×以反擊的蒙蘇軍隊，自己暴露出　　　　　了！一般跟着日×大言不慚地『反蘇』『反共』的漢奸，在這裏似乎應該醒悟一些罷，祖國何負於你們，而必出賣靈魂無恥無力的日×的鷹犬呢？</p>
<p>第三，日×目前，却集中一切力量以對英！如果說日本眞要反共，那麽日本的敵人應該是蘇聯；如果說為了太平洋上未來局勢，那麼日本的勁敵是美國不是英國！如果說日本爲要打擊援助中國抗</p>
<p>日的國家，則今日噯華最力的還有蘇聯美國法國，甚至可以說兩年來英國援華的程度，絕未超過蘇美兩國，然而日本今日不向其主要的「眞正」的×人進攻，却選中了態度最温和，行爲最謹愼，甚至對日外交處處表示謙讓的英國！平沼說：「日本以堅固决心，追求目的，必激底排斥一切妨害，苟英國未認識日本之趣旨，或不同意日本之意見除　裂之外無他。」同時在日本全國及其在華佔領區，到處展開反英運動。這裏又看到了日×之畏强　　！又看到了任何對日企圖與之妥協的國家，其命連祇是自動的退却以至自動的去做日×的犧牲品。</p>
<p>第四，對華問題，平沼在宣佈政策之時，已不敢有一字提及侵略戰爭的現狀及其前途了，這正證明了日×目前是怎樣的因爲我們堅持團結抗戰而給陷於空前的危困之境了！但是平沼却特別注重於在佔領地區建立偽新中央政權　一點。爲了加强這個新政權，夢想藉以勾結我國少數動搖份子頑固份子和少數昧却天良賣國求榮甘爲×人殉葬的份子，他宣佈了在僞新政權之下，可能容許反共的三民主義和國民黨；爲了鞏固佔領區的統治，及便利其對佔領區的壓和刼掠，他又堅决聲明半永久性的駐兵。</p>
<p>平沼　表的日本今後政策，一面暴露了日本侵華戰爭兩年來所遭受打擊的嚴重，暴露了日本本身的力量已經不能解救其目前的困難　危機了；但另一方面，則又暴露了，日×正想加緊從其仔　佔領區内，排除英國的一切勢力，刧奪英國的一切財富。取我中國</p>
<p>一切人力物力財力，以解救其困難；爲了實現　個企圖。他們不　　的對美献媚對蘇屈膝，他們不惜無恥的亂用反共的魔旗，造謠誣蔑挑撥間，然而亦正因此，更暴露　×日之末　　　　！</p>
<p>不願做奴隸的中國同胞，提高我們民族的自尊心和自信心罷！</p>

<p>— 劉竹舟</p>
<p>【貴陽通訊】全國慰勞總會的南路代表團，在踏入貴州境的時候，大家都爲一件事而興奮着。這件事，就是在貴州全境每一個角落的壯丁中間，興起了一種自動入伍服兵役的風氣。</p>
<p>自動入伍的壯了，在兵役當局的分類上，叫做「自願兵」。</p>
<p>據此間軍管區司令部的統計，截至五月底止，有壯丁自動入伍的縣份；爲丹江，荔波，桐梓，修文，息烽，遵義，淸鐵，興仁，江口，正安，正遠，吉陽·安韻·盧順·平壩，關嶺，盤縣等縣，合計二百九十八人。就中一般性的自動入伍者二百三十一人；替兄服役者五十四人；學生六十六人；苗胞四人；兄弟爭服兵役者二人；僧一人。都經當局傳令嘉獎，或分別發給獎金獎狀。</p>
<p>由於自動入伍的壯丁中間，有學生，有苗胞，有僧人，可知貴州的自願兵的風氣，是怎樣深入了各階層，各鄉村，以及各深山僻野。</p>
<p>大家不要以爲這二百九十八人，這價數目太小。不加重視，凡是一種風氣，都是漸漸的形成的，以荔波一種作例，該縣因爲宋登榜兄弟二人，爭服兵役，聞風興起，自願應征者達十一人之多。</p>
<p>貴州自願兵的風氣，是怎樣興起的，原因是：（一）得力於事先的宣傳。此間軍管區組有宣傳隊十隊，經常巡迴各縣，作種種的宣傳活動。（二）收效於事後的鼓勵。各級行政機構，各學校各團體而乃至各界民衆，每於壯丁自動入伍時，都舉行熱烈的歡送會，而省婦女運動委員會幷組織婦女慰問隊，頻頻向之慰問。（三）成功于壯丁們羣起仿效。一般人旣已接受了宣傳，而恥於安樂，樂於赴難，又感到請櫻殺×，有無上的光榮，在他的腦子裏，自然的便發生了仿效的念頭。</p>
<p>吳鼎昌主席在本年元旦，曾對他的僚屬說：「本年工作，兵役第一。」最近他本人更不斷的赴黔東，黔南，黔北，以及旱節等地視察兵役工作，與出席兵役軍訓會議，可見他對於兵役的重視。</p>
<p>現在各縣業經普遍的設立了兵役科，全省的兵役工作，已有驚人的成就。</p>
<p>總之，向有「民無三分銀」之稱的貴州同胞，已對成爲支持戰爭的主要因素的兵役問題，拚了最大的努力，有了最好的成績，希望自願兵的風氣，能够很快的普及全國，讓×人在我們面前發抖。（中央社）</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>日軍反戰的利劍</p>
<p>中日戰事，僅屆兩年，而日本內部的破綻，便一天勝似一天的暴露出來了。我們除在報上常看見日軍集體自殺，藥庫爆炸，各地兵變等這，連中可慶可賀的消息以外，記者壓槁至此，還接到一位實際參加戰事的友人范傑克君的來信，也同樣叙述着日軍與傳單有關的嚴重事實。范君前在新聞界服務，惟早年會入軍校，故自抗戰軍與，卽投入第××軍任連長：他信上有一說：</p>
<p>「前在台兒莊大戰時，×士兵質　很好，皆爲廿餘歲之青年，雖經激戰不退，其優勢可知。但是最近的×人，却是稚曾雜集，火線開始，多棄械逸潰，甚有哀號歇泣者。高級指揮官無奈，便嚴組督戰隊企圖補救，因此自相殘殺，也是常有的事。</p>
<p>「希着江南景色的第×戰區，近日不停地飛着毛毛雨。我們開到此間，適江西××縣被我××師克復，當在城邊揀得×人的反戰傳單三種，皆爲流利的日文；具漢趨如下：</p>
<p>「諸君要把中國奴隸化，彷彿是做夢！」</p>
<p>「一吾人爲這種侵略而犧牲，眞不如一隻犬！」</p>
<p>「一諸君可知道東京國庫里的基金往那里去了！」</p>
<p>「上述三種日軍深揷日軍腦髓的利劍似的反戰標語，下面皆署名「華南派遣軍有志」。我們從文法上，字體上，紙質上，印刷上研究，判斷這些傳單，確來自×國。×國內部政治之紊亂，軍人戰志之消沉，反戰空氣之瀰漫，均可於此見之。」</p>
<p>范君原信很長，但僅屬條上述一段，不贊已將日本內在的一切深刻矛屆，另用烏數方法該繪出一個輪廓來了。</p>
<p>我還要總結一句：×人在北戰場對我散佈的許多傳單，旣毫無效果如彼，而他們内部所醞釀着的反戰巨蝎，又復戰重如此——我們只消在抗戰正面再繼讀努力一個相當時期，那末，他們軍事，政治，經儕總崩潰的悲劇，就會立刻續演上台了！（完）</p>

<p>— 倫敦通訊　叔棣</p>
<p>（一）極顯明的例證</p>
<p>歐，亞，兩洲命運的不可分離，沒有比最近這兩次事件更能給予有力例證的了，上一次，是兩個多禮拜前，英，法，蘇協定成立喧囂塵上的，遠東的日本，忽然在外蒙邊境造出了一個緊張局勢；意思是說：萬一英國逕直興蘇俄成立完全軍事同盟的話，那末，它必得把被牽進去和日本開戰的可能，也先爲打算一下。這一用意，英政府立刻就感覺到了，但大多數的反應，却是一笑置之·英·法·蘇談判的重要性，英國是另有一些大得多的考慮，放在心上的。照當時的情形看，大概目前的日本，和佛郞哥的西班牙加在一處；在英政府的聯蘇與否的利害大秤上。還抵不上一個土耳其來得重。所以，在開始英，蘇談判的那些天，英國寧願向土耳其加緊接觸，而淡然置之了日本和西班牙，後來，西班牙加人德意軸心，已經成了難以挽囘事實的消息一證實，在反對與蘇聯結合的天秤那一端，又大大地減輕了分量。</p>
<p>因了英，蘇同盟的難產，就順便向日本政府賣弄一下好感，這是事實，又作爲他們反對與蘇聯完全結合的藉口之一，往往英國一些人士們，也舉出日本的態度，這也是事實。然而這一回英·蘇談判的進行與因難，與日本的反對與否，可以說是沒有什麽直搜關係。</p>
<p>不過，話雖如此，萬一英·法·蘇的同盟，今天已經成立的話，那末，在遠東的現在，何至于又出現了日本在天津向英要挾的事件·日本方面，大槪是誤解了上一次它的外蒙邊境示威在英蘇談判困難上的分量了吧，所以，也許它在想着；如果英國因爲畏懼日本的力量，而甚至顧忌和蘇俄同盟的話，那末，由於同樣的畏懼。英國在對於中·日戰的態度上，還有什麼不能屈服於日本的威脅呢？於是，它就大膽地向英國提出了一個英國萬難接受的要求的澈底和日本合作，造成「東亞新秩序」！</p>
<p>然而，事件也並不是這麼單純。在道時，日本突然來這麼一個舉動，那根源還有大半要歸於目前的歐洲形勢。歐洲的目前形勢，到底如何呢？這不在本文範園之内，不過，鄂簡括的形勢，不妨縮成三點：一，英蘇談判，進展毫無，並且最近的將來，恐怕也沒有大希望，二，德，意在歐洲，又在打算另造一個危機了；三，德意對日本拉攏的工作，仍在進行。</p>
<p>任何人現在都看得很明顯；日本這一次的對英要挾，實在是它對於加人德，意，軸心與否的最後一次討價還價，這一次失敗之後，大槪它是會正式加入德，意，西集團，而和它們訂立軍事同盟的。所以這兩天來日本駐意大使已經到了柏林，和它的駐意大使合作，與德國當局，保持密切的接觸，同時，在催促德，意，日，西軍事同盟早日實現的立場上看，希特勒自然是贊成日本向英國，伯倫現内閣，作這麽一個最移討價試騐。</p>
<p>也許，英·法·蘇的軍事同盟，反會出現在德·日·意·西的軍事同盟之後吧。</p>
<p>（二）千載一時的好機會</p>
<p>這兩天來，因爲日本軍人和浪人在天津的對英儘量侮辱，英國的報章上，已經充滿了這一類的記載，輿論的激昂，可算是到了極點，可是，如果仔細觀察一下，就立刻可以發現；這一切，並不緊張，現在英國對於日本的經濟，軍備，人力，以及一切的方面都淸淸楚楚地，有着正確的佔計·英國目前。固然不想同日本作戰；可是，他們以爲日本的困難情形，更不敢和英國來一個大規模的衝突，甚至連大規模衝突的危險也不敢臂的。</p>
<p>對這事，這兩天來，我和英國的一部份人士。曾經作了許多次的討論。他們一致的結論是：問題的焦點，還是在於張伯倫首相領導下的英國現政府，是否肯下决心；如果的話，那末。縱使想澈底地制裁日本，一舉而終結日本侵略中國的戰爭，也絕不是什麽難事。而且現在、正是一個最好的時機。</p>
<p>他們的理由，是：（一）英·法·蘇的同盟，雖然難產，然而他們的援助中國的立場多少是一致的。那末，在這個同盟難產的時候，正不妨在援助中國這一問題上，先做一個合作的具體試驗，作爲未來同盟的第一步驟。（二）美國鑑隊，已經調囘了太平洋，而目前却又是全體大戰未發，日本對美最恐慌的時候。（三）蘇俄的遠東紅軍，對日本駐滿洲軍力，絕對優勢，而目前却又是德，意在西方無能爲力，日本對蘇俄最害怕的時候。（四）日本對中國的戰事，又完全陷進了被動地位。所以，如果張伯倫現政府眞是下了决心、　　　　其裁制日本，情形戰爭，那末，目前這情形下，辦法是比較單純，可以預算出來的，比如：第一步，先向中國政府接洽一下，由英，蘇一·法，美四國給予大規模物質援助的保證，由中國方面，立刻舉行全面的總攻，第二步，相應着，蘇俄以大量的軍力，向遠東集中，給予日本一個最致命的威脅，第三步，英，美，法的遠東海軍，集中某些地域，舉行示威，於是第四步，向日本送一個最後通牒，召開九國會議一類的國際會議，解决一切中日間的爭議，這樣一來，那時候，放在日本面前的，祇有兩條路了：不是屈服壓力之下，終止他的對中國的侵略戰；就是反過來更進一步，加入德，意，西的軍事同盟。</p>
<p>「也許走後一條路的可能，是多些的吧。」—我說。</p>
<p>「並不一定。因爲那樣一來，連德，意，西的同盟，也都很成問題，不能作爲日本的靠山了」。何况，最低限度，「這樣子，正可以促成世界反侵略陳綫的正式成立一，</p>
<p>至於中國，美團，法國，以及蘇聯的態度呢，那可以說是不成問題的。祗要英國肯堅决的話，</p>
<p>目前情勢是這樣的明顯，英國當局們，對這些是完全知道的。所以，這兩天來，據我們能够知道和能看到的而論，英國向日本提去的暗示着的警吿，正式地，私人間地，以及與論方面地，巳經在紛紛着了；「危險呀！」「危險呀！」「你的致命點，已經在這里了呀！」「如果我們一動手的話呀！」……等等。</p>
<p>（三）英現政府的籌思</p>
<p>如果說日本軍閥們，對上述情勢是完全麻木的，那倒或許不至於；大槪是逆料到英國現政府的决不至出上面的一着，所以，方敢對英國放心任意地侮辱起來，可是，我們必須知道，英國在遠東的目前基本立場，無論如何，絕對不會因了日本的擾攘，而有所改變，而况在當前這英，法，蘇同盟，正在進行中，而中，英邦交，又是在最密切的時候。英政府現在的唯一籌思，就是：如何在這些綜錯的國際關係裏，找出一個最適於他自己的途徑，去搪過日本當前的要挾，這些途徑，在英國方面，仍是非常之多的。不過，萬一日本固執已見，錯認英國的舉措不定是原於力弱，還是迫它合作，創造什麼「東亞新秩序一的話，那末，到最後英國也許會被迫而採取上說的一個澈底辦法。</p>
<p>我再在這裏重複一週；想英國和日本合作，創造什麽「東亞新秩序」，依目前情勢，無論從那一個角度看，是萬萬不可能的！萬萬不可能的！（六月十六日自倫敦寄）</p>

<p>這幾天，世界各報都爲日×反英運動的新聞所佔據了、</p>
<p>日×爲什麽反英？第一，想在英日談判前預向英國嚇詐，迫英放棄援華政策，第二，準備獨霸鞏固及經營在華佔領區。</p>
<p>我們在這裏要認淸：（一）反英卽反歐美的第一步；（二）英國及歐美無論在道義上在利害上都不能與日妥協；（三）歐美列强唯有以力對力以牙還牙。</p>
<p>至於我們中國，根據兩年抗戰經騐，凡×人所喜的，是我國禍害，凡×人所恨的，是我國的所利，因此，日×喜歡反英，我們就要反對反英　日×恨英，我們就要更加親英！</p>
<p>然而日×反英絕不是因爲英國援華，我們　英絕不是依賴英國，在這裏，奉日×之命侈言反共和平而又倡爲英國卽將逼我屈服的　言，是沒有絲毫根據的！在這裏，以自力更生爲基本而力爭外援的原刖要澈底實現！</p>
<h3 id="c21">東南沿海戰局 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>東南沿海各省的戰事，這幾天突轉緊張。這是我們戰略上爭取更大勝利的第一步驟。</p>
<p>日×最近在汕頭潮州玉環定海山石等處登陸其目的在：（一）掩飾其陸軍各綫無力進攻；（二）威脅英法等國在遠東之地位；（三）興德意搖相呼應。因此，對我軍事，是毫無影響的。</p>
<p>但是，日×在沿海騷優，同時亦含有從軍事上及經濟上策應其政治進攻的企圖，以便利其組織爲中央政權，以便利其利用我東南的人力物力財力。</p>
<p>因此我們在東南各省開始反攻，擴大×後戰鬥，如最近之聞攻江會廣州，切斷京滬鐵路等，一是具有非常重大意義的，我們今後，還要配合大親的模反汪肅好運動，以求更大的勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c23">抗戰的現勢及前途 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 高山</p>
<p>新的形勢與新的危機</p>
<p>英勇抗戰的兩年，日本××不，不在我中華民族全體面前丟臉了！他們「不　而屈」的上策是失敗了，它們「戰速决」的次策是失敗了，它們「速和速結」的又次策也失敗了。最後，當我們抗戰已經一年的時候，它們曾經企圖拿佔領武漢來屈服我們，來戰勝我們，然而結果我們仍舊沒屈服，我們仍舊沒有認識，它們的一切企圖失收了。那以後，他們就不得不承認：「中日戰爭已經進入新的階段」；他們不得不承認，「眞正的戰爭的開始是在佔領武漢之後」，他們不得不發出「要準備跟中國進行百年戰爭」的哀鳴了！</p>
<p>事實使日×明瞭：他們非適應戰爭之新階段，决定新辦法來穿服困難不可了，不過，他們更明瞭：要克服他們今日在中國所遭遇的困難，是不能够依靠於日本本國的人口，土地與生產的，所有這些已經在過去的侵華戰爭中幾乎消耗大半了；因此，它們便採取了以軍事配合的政治的經濟的侵華新策略，用我國的人力物力財力來解救其困難。</p>
<p>這個新策略，是說明了日本××主要的要依靠政治的力量，配合軍事的行動，來統治佔領區域的中國，來侵略未被佔領的中國。達到呑併全中國獨霸東亞的目的。所以他們提出了要建立東亞的「新秩序」，它們提出了要建立中日滿的協同政體。這都說明了：日×要把中國完全拿政治的方法，配合軍事的行動，呑併到日本××統治底下，來獨霸東亞。日×侵華的主要方向，就給放在佔領區域，放在我國東部，華北華中華南，整個黄河以東，平漢粤漢兩路以東這個地方，也就是人口最多，土他最肥物產最豐的我國東部廣大地區。他們就要利用這個地區的統治，吸收我國的人力物力財力，拿我國的人力物力財力，來進攻來征服我國。</p>
<p>廣州武漢失陷以來八九個月的事實，完全證明日×極力促進這一個新的策略。在這個總的方針之下，在軍事上他們採取了「跳躍作戰」和「以戰養戰」。所謂「跳躍作戰」，就是藉其佔有重要城市與交通綫、藉其擁有現代化的機械化納部隊。藉其軍隊的機動性，來補救其兵力不足與分散，來補救其進攻目標的消失，突襲及確佔我較弱的一點一地，來逐步破壞我們的反竣力，來掃蕩佔領區的游擊隊，以擴張其佔領區的邊綫和鞏固佔領區的統治，所謂「以戰養戰」，也就是以這種「跳躍作戰」來加强佔領區及其所治的確保，利用佔領區内我國人力物力財力去補充養大其戰鬥力，逐步實現併呑全中國。在政治上，他們一面極力從事於佔領區統治的鞏固，利用欺騙的宣傳和虛僞的懷柔，建立及鞏固佔領地區的漢奸政權傀儡組織，進而利用汪精衞出來，積極準備組織統一的僞中央政府或偽聯邦政府，以便推行「以戰養戰」策略，以便用我國的人力物力財力，來進攻與征服我國，另一方面，則加緊阻止我國政治上的進步二緊加破壞我國以××××爲基幹的抗日民族統一戰線，加緊造成我們對持久抗戰的動搖和悲觀的情緒，以達到我國內部的分化分裂紛爭，而中止抗日戰爭。他們爲了這個企圖，目前正在利用汪精衞等主唱的「和平，反共，反蔣，民蘇」的論調，千方百計的勾引我內部還存在的若干民族敗類，動搖汾子，頑固份子，昧却天良，還想賣國自利的份子，千方百計的在我國內部找求第二汪精衛，此外，在經濟上在文化上，也配合着發動了種種進攻，如打擊法幣，如套取外匯，如封鎖天津租界，强佔汕頭定海，覬覦福州温州，以圖劫奪財實，專斷商務，如收買報紙學校，恫嚇主持正義的人士，眞是無恥卑鄙，無所不用其極！最後，在外交上，最近一面擴大反英運動，一面擴大對蘇挑釁，用誘騙與嚇詐的手段，逼使反侵略陣綫中最弱一環的英國政府對日妥協，企圖進而共同壓迫我國降服於日×獸脚之下。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c24">鄧南遮之死 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>求生不得。尋死更難</p>
<p>意大利最大的詩人——失禮得很，用他自己的話來說，應當是「全世界一最大的詩人，——戲劇家，和戰場上的英雄鄧遮南氏到底　上了一件最痛心的事，而這事也就是他二十年來苦心積慮力謀阻止的——那就是『死』，一個平凡的「死」，毫不動人的死。自然，他並不怕死，可每他　要一個不平凡的「死」。而現在來上這樣一個和平常人一樣的寧靜的　終正寢。對於這位偉大的舉世皆知的人物，是何等不愉快的事啊！</p>
<p>鄧南遮是大詩人，飛將軍，阜姆一役的英雄，法西斯的忠實信徒，同時又是一位「多情種子」，像一幕最精彩的戲劇。他的一生充滿了高潮，一個接運一個博得了無限的　聲。那末他所以要努力把自己的死造成一個更大的高潮。在閉幕之後再讓人喝「滿堂彩」。在世人腦子裏留下一個深刻不可磨滅的印象，這囘事，無論從那一方面看來，都是很合理的事。</p>
<p>他計劃了許多驚人的死法。不幸的是，每一種都有點困難，在嘉大湖上，他別墅的草地裏，點綴着一尊意國戰着巨砲。他想：假如立在砲口前，一砲轟成微塵飛散，豈不痛快省事？然而這是需要有人合作的事，而開砲的人却要担上一個謀殺的罪名，沒有人願意幫助他完成這轟轟烈烈的一死。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的事件發生，一時　意兩國大有劍　弩張之勢，他决不放過機會。馬上又打定一個好主　，他自吿奮勇，請求軍事當　允許他駕駛滿裝烈性炸　的飛機，去炸美國的戰艦。他打算，揀中目標之後，來上一個疾如飛來的俯衝，撞上戰艦的甲　，如此則飛機戰艦與詩人，一時同歸於盡。方法不壞，而且很有　到目標的可能性，　南遮雖則年邁而又眇一目，而當年雄風却還在呢！……不幸，英意兩國空閙一陣，萬事和平解决，　南遮壯志難酬，傷心何似！</p>
<p>退而思其次，跳火山口也不壞，就近的維蘇威斯和屈姆波里火山　行，……然而當他曉得有成千上萬的日本人全是　火山自殺的時候，立刻打銷原議。堂當的大詩人，豈有追附他人驥尾之理？</p>
<p>同樣的，又放棄了一個富有詩意的死法：在別墅裏佈置一小間臥室，滿堆用毒藥　製過的各色玫瑰，然而沒睡倒在花叢中，在芬芳的毒藥氛中死去。……一個不知趣的朋友吿訴他：從前一個法國人也是用此法自殺了，於是，此路又吿不通。</p>
<p>在情　上，他是一個冷酷的魔手，忍心的把兩個女伶，杜絲和伊達，戲弄了一番，然後棄若敝展，在某一時候，他熱烈希望兩人之中有一個會愛極生恨的跑來殺死他，那來，借美人玉手。　死猶幸，看來兩個女的沒有一個有這樣的勇氣，杜絲抑鬱不歡。帶着一顆支離破碎的心。香銷玉殞；伊達呢，跑來找他，要求仍舊做個精神上的朋友，詩人氣　發了瘋，放出狗來　她，偏偏狗也不爭氣，反和伊達表示分外的親熱。</p>
<p>最够刺激的，還有一個方法：氷凍保存法。說來容易；只須有一個飛機師駕機載他到格林蘭島上某一大氷河的發源地去，到了那裏，他用跳傘降落到冰河上，够了，最後一件事他必須做的，僅僅是擺出一個最美觀最莊嚴的姿勞，坐在冰上，讓低温的慢慢凍死自己，這樣，屍體凍結在冰裏，成了冰河的一部份。</p>
<p>冰河的移動是很慢的，一百年或二百年後，屍體隨冰流到下游，終有人會發現出這位「雪藏詩人」來的，報章雜誌上又將鬨動一時，出風頭目的可達。退一步說，卽使不被發覺，當時詩人失蹤一事，一定也　家誦戶曉，　孺皆知，不過，麻煩又　了，誰願意載他去送終　？</p>
<p>末後，他發現了一個比較簡單些的方法了。有一天，他懶洋洋地聽着兩位電影技衛人員對話，　到一句：</p>
<p>「化學溶解！」</p>
<p>一個大啓示，科學昌明的　日，難道沒有一種溶液可以溶解人體麽？幾個月之後，一位朋友收到他的信。說他已經覓到一種溶解人體至一絲毛髮，一粒牙齒，一根骨頭也不剩的烈性酸液，然而並不侵蝕浴盆的磁質。他預備在這種酸　作最後一次的沐浴，那末，頃刻之間，大詩人還留人間的，僅僅是盆底上些少的沉而已，他所求於這位朋友者，便是請他在數分鐘之後進浴室來，放掉酸液和盆底的渣滓，用淸水冲洗干凈，務期不留　痕跡。而這位朋友，必須守口如瓶，不洩　他的去向，那末，這樣神秘的　去，將成為世界上一個大謎，鄧南遮的名字，也可以不被人很快的遺忘了。</p>
<p>同時，他寫給另一朋友的信上：</p>
<p>『我要使全世界爲我的死而驚異……我要化爲一種香氣，混和天地之間。我將揮發而爲無數微　的分子。我决不在普通的墓穴裏　爛。你能想　到「蓋布里部南遮」。被殺在柩車裏，讓一羣　來的「號喪」人和傻瓜們送去埋葬麽？相信我，我將以最　人尋味的姿態死去，』</p>
<p>的，不平凡的鄧南遮，確也應當有不平凡的死。</p>
<p>再過十一天就是他七十五歲的誕辰了。一般人都相信，他的死或者會在那一天上演出，薪增興趣</p>
<p>可惜死神不耐久候了。腦溢血的病症——說說來可嘆，這並不算新鮮。腦溢血曾在海上，陸上和空中殺死了很多的人——很快的致了他的死命，如此迅速連手裏正寫作着的　也來不及放下，紙上的　水也未吸乾。事前毫不通知，突如其來的破壞了　後的高潮。好好的一幕　。閙成狗尾續貂，鄧南　是一定死不瞑賽。假如有可能的話，我相信，他是很願意復活過來。重新表演一次更精　更動人的結局的。</p>
<p>『喂！朋友，空氣點，行不行？我明天還要結婚呢！』</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文概述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員此　，趁德　去　歷歡迎，因爲英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來　刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來，好容易地逃出虎口，囘到紐約去。　克斯又叫　們趁一聖瑪克號」去歐洲找他的兒子。在船上，傑克不肯　一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報，原來　像伙就是叫拉維基的德國奸細。突然船上接到求救無線電……</p>
<p>他們又凝視了一會，忽然，有件事，使他們一腔熱血，涼了一半，他們互相注視着，　惑不定起來。</p>
<p>在黑暗里，從那着火的船上，傳到他們耳中。　一種聲音，似乎是一種苦悶的嘆息聲。一再的傳來，忽高忽低，如泣如訴，那不是人的聲音，那聲音，像含有幽怨的鬼魂在呻吟。</p>
<p>『晤！這到有些怕人！』比爾叫起來，『閙的是甚麼鬼呀？』</p>
<p>十四，跳下海去</p>
<p>小艇放下水，那個怪聲音。仍　　　　。這種　　。神秘的空氣，使得那些粗野的水手，都胆寒起來，有幾個敎徒，虔誠的在胸前畫着十字。</p>
<p>『眞要命，　直的，鬼哭　號！』有一個，自己咕嚕着。</p>
<p>傑克和比爾，坐在第一條小船上，伍德先生的身旁，船在往下放、上面，船欄上，　着一排人頭。都是都些看　　的旅客們。　落到水面，一個浪　上來，伍德先生大聲叫着。</p>
<p>「我們快搖開，不然，　　　！」</p>
<p>這時候，大船，也是起伏不定，看起來，小船眞像要碰着她　鋼鑄的船身，撞成粉碎呷。那小船，迎着浪，向前擺，一個個的巨浪，向他們蓋上來，又拖囘去。</p>
<p>「今晚上的天氣，可眞不帮忙。」伍德先生自言自語。小船也就穿進了一層無底的黑暗，那着火的船上，又是一殺血紅的火光，沖起來，罩往了那條船的舵尾，照出那是一艘，大，　　　的輪船。</p>
<p>『船上可有乘客，你想？』傑克問着。有點不寒而慄，因爲　　悲慘的聲音，仍舊不　得在發出來</p>
<p>『我看起來，那是個怪傢伙，看不見　頭，她又沒有上層甲根。』伍　說。</p>
<p>『在她上面，我沒看見人。」比　設，他仔細看了一會兒，小船又越過了一個大浪。</p>
<p>『我們只希望，他們都走開啦，」伍德說。『但是，這　怪叫，眞　心！那又不是人，究竟是什麽鬼？』</p>
<p>『它鬧得我心驚胆戰啦，』比　　　　　。</p>

<h3 id="c32">關於通僑文藝的二三意見 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>文藝的通俗化、大眾化是中國文藝發展的新路向，新的起點，這新的路向的採擇，新的起點的設定，是文藝工作者的自我覺醒，同時是受中國文學發展的歷史的敎訓所限定的，抗戰是作爲一個動力，緣於政治條件的改變，宣佈需要的急迫，催促了文藝工作者的醒覺，文藝發展新階段的新生。</p>
<p>由上面的理解，我們便可以清楚兩點：第一是現時段文樣運動，是新的文藝革命運動；這新的文藝革命運動的具體內容便是文藝的通俗化大衆化：第二是這一個運動，是抗戰期間的產物，是遭應抗戰的重要而發展起來的；而戰時它是撈記着文藝發展新階段的開始，所以不是應急的運動。</p>
<p>在這一個運動當中，那還把文藝當爲少數人享用的東西的作者，歷史將給予他們以無情的遺聚，另一方面，創作通俗文藝——大衆文藝的作者，又必須了解當前運動的發展意義、以最審愼的態度產生作品。理論家和批評者，也必須從對於運動的理解上，從作品的批評上，指出創作的路向和應該避免的缺失。</p>
<p>通俗文藝的作者，首先要知道自己要的的是文藝，而不是文藝以外的作品，這本來是用不着說的，然而現在有些通俗文藝的作者，却正正忘記了或無視了這一點寫了一些四不相的東西出來七年前瞿秋白就說過：「如果僅僅幾句抽象的理論，用說着的體裁寫出來，就可以當做文藝作品，那就根本用不着文學運動，因爲這祗是通俗的論文，文藝作品當經過具體的形象，…用描寫表現的方法，而不是用推論歸納的方法。」現在有些作者就是忘記了文藝的特殊性能，或死板地錯誤地理解作品的敎育性，作品雖然「借用」了舊文藝的格式和腔調，却是一大堆名詞術語、完全沒有描寫可表現，這無疑是要失敗的。</p>
<p>更壞的就是警用土話俗語，把非常粗鄙的語言放在作品裏面，右作者以爲這才算通俗，才是口語化，不知這不是通俗而是庸俗；不是口語化、而是語言藝術的低級化，通俗文藝的語言，遼必須是經過選持和洗鍊了的民間口語。</p>
<p>其次，利用舊形式創作通俗文藝。是利用舊形式的精華，而不是接受舊形式的渣滓和毒紫。爲着適應廣大羣衆的程度和要求，同時爲着提為廣大羣衆的藝術滋味爲若新形式的創造。這樣地來利用舊形才有前途，我們在利用舊形式，同時就有破壞為形式，在創造新形式！我們很同意蒲風的一段話：「如果你機械地判認「新」與「舊」，則新的永遠離不了「舊」，新形式永遠不能建立，反過來說，假如我們的東西是通過了當前的時代觀人生觀而且我們的作品有現實生活的映照，在形式上極能接近大衆，但决不似五更調，無錫景等之有一定的形式，則可以說是新的形式業已建立。」</p>
<p>現在有些作者似乎不了解這一點·利用舊形式的時候。給舊形式困得太慘痛，於是導致了兩個毛病：第一就是「形式走向內容」，因爲格式是那樣子，不能不塡充够數，第二·就是形式妨碍了内容，所謂形式對內容起了反撥的作用，這結果，作品不是沒有生命，便是「殘廢」了，不是「懷假洽」便是「纏小脚」。</p>
<p>再次，對於通俗文藝，有些作者還有一個誤解就是以爲通俗文藝是粗淺的簡單的東西，於是結構一個前單的故事，便算是「貨色」。是的，那是「貨色」，是通俗文藝，是大衆能够接受的作品。然而那止於大衆能够接受而已，却不爲大衆歡迎和愛好。旣不爲大衆歡迎和愛好，那你祗好承認失敗了。</p>
<p>我們不能吧大衆看得太低能和無智，沒有欣，術作品的能力，反之我們應該都知道許多舊作品，都是內容非常豐富，情節非常複雜的，而這些作品正爲大衆所愛好，大衆愛它引人入勝，够味。若果我們的作品，做不到引人入勝，做不到够味邦也祗好承認失敗了。通俗文藝是不易寫的，不斷努力是打破難關的唯一塗徑；正如瞿秋白論「大衆文藝」時所說：「實際」作開始之後，經騐遠會吿訴我們計多新的方法。」</p>
<h3 id="c33">評珍珠的「愛國者」 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 文俞</p>
<p>獲得一九三八年的諾貝舊文學獎金的美國女作家，賽珍珠氏，在本年出版她的描寫中國的小說「愛國者」，據說，這書尙未寫完，却已被選爲美國讀書社本年三月最好的一本小說了。在我國這愛貧弱的出版界，也不約而同的產生了至少三個譯本，這本小說的轟動，也可想而見了，然而，我們精神秘之國，連自己也不易看得淸楚，尤其是抗戰的發動，社會現實顯現了大激盪，使人們更難諦視，却不知許了什麽福，紀有一位二十世紀的名匠替我們刻畫這形象，無疑的我們需要感謝；而感謝之數，却要仔細的作一番實察的工夫。</p>
<p>資本者的兒子，吳彝範，或為自階層的叛逆，革命的戰士，在半殖民地的中國是很可能的然而他的這一稱號後，有着他的必然成偶然的諸因素，自有其一番内心的鬥爭，他才能脫掉富麗的衣衫，走進城樓的羣列。在典型的創作上，這是個成功與否的决定因素，能够完滿描繪者是成功抹去不提者便不成功，賽珍珠是怎樣把握吳彝範這人物呢？</p>
<p>無論，她把他的專變，歸於他自己的任性不覊，「那是民國十五年，他家裏人做夢也想不到，彝範竟變成一個革命黨，」輕輕一帶，把他派作一個革命黨了，那麽，這人物只是觀念化的，不是有血有肉的。</p>
<p>一個優秀軟弱的靑年，經不起戰鬥的工作的，然而他却工作了，訓練組織上海的工人，準備革命風暴的來臨，他工作若，敎育人們應該自己也受了敎育，他應該變成堅實；然而他在風華湧茂之時，他失敗，他絕望，他仍忘却祖國的一切，他開始在日本過活，他成了耽樂者；他戀愛，他只知道戀愛他的珠，昏沉地過了十年，他再也沒有革命的熱情，已從一個幻想者過渡到「依靠現實而生」活一的人，在革命的退潮中沉澱下來，這在現實上是有他的會影，然而，這種轉變，我們看不見中間的橋樑，令人無從看到「典型的性格」，因而只是觀念化的，沒有血肉的了。</p>
<p>恩蘭，是「愛國者」的第二個主角，無疑的作者把他作爲新興階層的戰士的典型，這樣描寫是不够的，不如說是把戰士的形姿用了凹凸鏡的反正而歪曲了。恩蘆，這個給我們看來是熱情而狂暴，不倫不類的荒誕的人物，她（作者）不能够明瞭這些羣衆的戰士和領導者的堅毅英勇。不明白他們是怎樣的和羣衆連繫在一起，怎樣爲他和而實行戰鬥！</p>
<p>牡丹，在醫中顯然是次要的人物，但却吿白了作者對於中國新女性絲毫沒有認識淸楚，她沒有能夠知道新舊兩代已是完全不同，她還以爲新女性戰士依然只是和舊日一樣，替丈夫解，替丈夫縫紉，生孩子，她不知道中國新女性巳獨立地英勇地參與羣衆的鬥爭！</p>
<p>「典型性格一的錯誤，是由於」典型環境，把握的錯誤，作者沒有能够把握中國社會性質，對中國革命也缺少理解和同情，她以爲中國已是「銀行家統治」的資本主義社會，抹煞了中國半封舊半殖民地的性質，這樣一來，她伊無從把握得住中國革命的迂迴曲折，波潤起伏的情狀，舊中國的一切，恐怕太緊的抓住作者的記憶，因此她對於新興集團認作養和團的「借屍還魂」了。她對於中國的革命，只是浮光掠影淺嘗卽止的認知。對於在革命波濤中的男女，如何能得把握得正確？</p>
<p>說到抗戰，這一假新中國誕生的時機和動力，作者操得她的知識太過貧弱了，她歪曲了、「西安事變」——奇怪，爲什麽她不讀史諾的「西行漫記」。她不理解中國統一陣線的構築的現實情狀，還認爲中國軍隊需要用錢來收買。她對於中國優待俘虜的榮譽的事實置之不顧，竟幻想一段民衆虐殺俘虜而且得恩蘭默許的故事出來，這是一個詆燬，而義務替日本作了惡意宣傳！這些汚點，是洗滌不掉的了！</p>
<p>她記住了中國的汚穢，鴉片，迷信，生活貧困；社會秩序的紊亂，她寫了一個鮮明的對比，就是，日本的秩序，潔凈，愛美，沒有乞丐（？）……她表現着日本人的「愛國心」——關於這，她的表揚多於針刺。她不懂得日本社會的結構，也謓美了日本的女性。她心目中的彝範和珠的家庭，是最理想的家庭。她的政治思想呢？她寫道：</p>
<p>「他（彝範）對於這許多事情常常想着，戰後誰能够統治理國家，法律如何重訂，應該何種法律，他現在曉得恩蘭是不够做一個統治者，開明，學繳，秩序文雅，是生活所需的，但是恩蘭都不知道，彝範覺得珠轉變了他的思想，她敎他去愛好秩序，善良的性質和態度，她已同他相隔十年了，他十年來在日本生活，足使他知道一切，他見到日本的人民此這種的更忠實，他們的生活更有秩序，他不敢同恩蘭說他×人的長處，因爲恩蘭也許要以爲他稱×人之長，而不信任他的效忠。……他這樣想，足以表示出他已經成年了……」</p>
<p>這段話正是作者的說辭，表白了她對中國未來的疑慮和朦戰。無疑，中個的一切的者，中國的革命，中國的偉大的抗戰，於她都是很朦朧的。</p>
<p>在中國抗戰中，人們渴求着對中國社會和中國抗戰的理解，憲珍球的「愛國者」的出現，自然豐轟動一時。然而她不能替我們把新中國從舊中國脫頴而出的姿態顯現，却混和了新的舊的，好的壞的，成了一盤「雜碎」迷蒙了中國的出路和前途，便不能提高歐美人士對中國的了解，反而提高了他們對中國的誤會，而且，作者有意把我們的領袖熙委員長作爲一揷話的人物，無異這不過是眩惑讀者，迎合騐者的手法吧了。她的取巧，她的想以歪曲現實，使她的作品弄成散碎不整的，虛假的，可笑的，自然她的瑣細描寫，藝術手法，確實辦的作品穿了錦檽的外衣。不過，她能够很巧妙的表露了日本軍隊在革的魄力，由此又可以證明她對現實也有很忠實的地方；可是她之不昨懂得中國，不了解中國的抗戰，却是無疑的。</p>
<h3 id="c34">通俗與流俗 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>寫「通俗文藝」離「通俗」而不致淪爲「流俗」尤難。</p>
<p>流俗文章本不就是通俗的作品，但作品一旦要使其通俗，却就不免近於「流俗」的危險性了。</p>
<p>這層道理要講得明白，似非分析一下「通俗文藝」的特微不可，在文藝領域中通俗的一類是最最接近大衆，最能在大衆中發生作用的部門，但要它做到這個地步却十分需要迎合大衆的嗜好，而以民間的語言寫出民間現實的故事，這是，「通俗文藝」最顯著的特徵，同時也就是「通俗」易化爲「流俗」的關鍵。爲丁極力使文章的通俗，致力子揣摹羣衆的嗜好，興趣，迎合他們，適當他們，這是對的，文藝也祗有籍這種通俗的形式，工具才能深入大衆，爭取大眾；不過若偶然本末倒置，一味隨着習俗的需求而改變自己文章的內容，那末通俗文藝卽會失去其提高大衆文化與水準興變革大衆眾想意義的原旨，而淪于「流俗」的境地。</p>
<p>這個轉變實在是一個微妙的玄虛，一個極可怕的惡局，每一個通俗玄藝工作者不容加以忽視。</p>
<p>我們很可以想像到某一個宣傳隊到民間工作去的時候僅以荒誕無稽的愚言博得民衆一場大笑是多麽無味的事，「通俗文藝」一旦成為「流俗文章」的結局也並不較此不高明多少。現在有些人主張以變愛或那一類素材爲骨梗而展開通俗文藝的工作，我就怕因此無形中成爲流俗文章而不自覺，其實文章的「通俗」並不單于趣味的低級和題村的庸俗，祗須道出大眾眞心話，容易偉，而故事簡單緊張，又何嘗不都是上好的通俗文藝，羣眾喜歡看「馬寡婦開店」和「潘金蓮」，却也同樣高興接受洪楊豪俠傳」和抗戰的事。原因不在于一定是迎合低級嗜好，大半還是由于後者所寫的都是大衆所深切了解的，所想做的事情，自然容易使他們變好了，因此「通俗，不必一味」合卑俗的需求，不必無條件的利用舊形式。我們要處處在，衆中起領導作用，通過，通俗」的形式來提高大眾文化水準對于大眾文藝作者的改進，在過渡時代中慢慢需要大眾的嗜好與興趣，她就絕對不會祗圖獲取讀者羣衆而陷于「流俗」可恥的地步，以後喪却通俗本意了</p>
<p>「流俗文章」祗能麻痹讀者大衆，我們須加倍的警惕，加意以防止「通俗」認爲「流俗」！</p>

<p>本港防空佈置，在當局努力推進之下，已大致完成，各訪空部隊，多告成立，如消防隊，發掘隊，救傷隊等，一下　員令，卽可歸隊集中效力，</p>
<p>參加防空未見踴躍</p>
<p>現　引以為據者，則居民參加防空服務，未見踴躍，故防空救護員甚缺乏，與原定名額九千人，相差尙多，而消防後備員報名訓練者，亦未見積極，消防隊本身實力，則已加強，最近由英購到救火機一批，在　週內，外間頗有批評港府對防空設備，　于緊張，但在西班牙及最近戰事所得之結論，認為以志氣彈侵襲人口疎該而地而廣　之城市，所需甚巨，為經濟原則所不許，然此種批評，祇知其一而不知其二，蓋空襲方式，非徒毒氣彈，若以轟炸彈及燃燒彈向商業區域嚴密地點投機，則　人所　　，而我所損巨矣，</p>
<p>準備防禦毒氣侵襲</p>
<p>惟毒氣侵襲，亦為空襲方式之一，吾人于籌謀全盤防空設備，不能缺此而不備，以貽百密一疏之譏，同時可以昭示×人有備，使有所畏，燒夷彈為重要空襲之武器，肆虐範圍至廣，然若能迅速撲救，則應付未必甚難，此則視乎防空員之調度能否得宜，如發現燒夷彈時，凡為防空員者，能迅速利用貯備之砂及長柄鏟將之樸滅，則不致釀成燎原，現為實習起見，已特向英倫訂購燒夷彈一批，不日由藍煙通輪運抵本港，如火勢已成，則防空員宜迅速知發掘隊及消防隊到場灌救，及攔截火勢，至於救傷隊及消毒隊，亦訓練成熱，於空襲警報發出後，數分鐘內即能集合，準備出發災區服務，</p>
<p>貯備沙包分發應用</p>
<p>日前防空處曾舉行試放毒氣，消毒隊在防毒面具保護之下，數分鐘內卽能趕至災場，關於防毒面具每具來價，值港幣二元半，現港府已貯備一批，於緊急時期，然後出售，若誤用本港三民貧苦大眾，對於購置面三，實難辦到，此屬實情，如　此及訓示其自建經濟之防毒室外，則政府對於其他問題，現時實難為力，將來能否實現，亦未敢必，至於大規模之防空壕及暗道等建議，則港府已決定放棄，政府現開始貯備沙包，於必要時，分派居民應用，並指示其佈置，則茍非為炸彈直接　中，則碎片流彈，自能防禦，在本港情勢此實為最　而又最有效之方法，關於　火管制已準備完竣，惟尙不有定期，蓋有待於港府正大批准也，</p>

<h3 id="c49">救傷包 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>在接濟我們冒着彈雨，在前方浴處抗戰的英勇戰士，最重要的東西是　彈，是糧食，還有醫藥。有時彈盡糧絕，還可肉搏，但受傷而沒有了醫藥，就動彈不得了，所以醫藥在戰時佔着一個絕對重要的地位的。無論在過去與現在，我們在前方工作人員的口中所聽到的，都是訴說救傷藥材是如何地缺乏。顯然地，在抗戰二十多個月當中，前方醫藥的　　，還未能配合起抗戰積極地改　。</p>
<p>我們實在不能任令一個在前線受　創的戰士，　痛受苦，則　不休，因傷而成大創，甚至損失他的寶貴的生命，因為一個受傷而　愈的百　將士。他的寶貴而英勇的經驗，會比新進戰士作戰効能大上幾倍，這是事實，這是鐵一般的事實。</p>
<p>為了匡助前　救護醫藥的不遠，於是，救傷包　糧藥西　產生了，這種包」的內容是非常輕小而簡單的，裏面是　帶布消毒紗布棉花，　　　等，農糧物價構成的，受傷的人，把救　包一端的長線拉開，便　出一顆　　，把　痛　食了，繼把消毒的紅　　先點在創口上，然後拿　　把創口　上，這麼樣，受傷戰士，旣　少了痛苦，創口也不予發　，　到抬回後方　　　的時候，　狀是不會怎樣　的這個　　是前綫將士救急　苦的　實。</p>
<p>現在，開發到前方作戰　每一個戰士的身上，差不多都！上這三的一個　符，我們戰線這樣的廣泛，戰士這樣的　　。這種救傷包大量的需要是不言而喻的，所以過去本港各救亡團體，都非常注意這件事，經常大　　製造，輪送到前方去。現在中國婦女慰勞會香港分會更發動捐助五十萬個救　包運動，僑胞都能深切認　這件事的重要而繼續地響應捐助，這個情況是可喜的。</p>
<p>因了它所處地位的重要，對於藥料和紗布的選擇是應該非常　重的，特別止痛餅這種藥物，因為它是整個救傷包的靈魂，我們理樂應該忽視的，過去，這種救傷包曾經由中央和紅十字會指定了定製的標準，但是，因為這種止痛餅的原料是一種列性的刺激品，非經當局的特許，是不能購買這種藥劑的，不過，因為急切需要的原故，很多製造商人都拿一種比較容易買　的藥品來替代，這種容易買到的止　　，往往是醫治頭　或其他部份的疼痛最拿手的藥，　　一的功力，就是發散出汗，傷兵的創口，對於這是大惡的。所以它的止痛功能，　成一樣，但　　　，曾經是相反的，有了這種的止　　　　，對於受傷的戰士不很重要，而且有害，所以　　的人，是</p>
<p>這　　　　　　的主　　　　　，為了這件事，曾經　　　　，中央　　　　和本　　　　的洽，結果是定製了幾十萬　。</p>
<p>記者找了一個很好的機會，　　　的負責人許　先生發起救傷包的需要和　做的情形，他　詳細的加以分晰，特別指出止痛餅選擇的問題，他們因為種種關係，對於原料方面，是比較容易解決的，最低限度，他們不會　　一些發汗　痛餅，其次他們也有自備消毒機器，一切的製造手續上，都很妥當，這是中央曾公開的推荐新亞　　的一個重大的原因。</p>
<p>現在，南洋　　各地的華僑團體捐贈救傷包的，　　都是和　　　　定造　，本港的慰勞分會，中　　女會和其他的救亡團體，大半都是在為　定製的，假如團體　　　　的話，　　你　　　去，　　　會和你　造，和你　　，和　　　　　　的運動——捐助救傷包，前方的染　　　這種　　，我相信他們一定能夠用更　更光榮的戰　來答復我們的。</p>

<p>那麽有人要問了：戰爭是武力解决，三民主義不能作武力之用。我可以答復這佣疑問，戰爭决于國力的總和，而最大最後的力量，就是民族精神。我可以說，在第一期抗戰當中，我們所受的挫拆，主要的還是因爲我們過去在精神方面的準備與鍛鍊不够，很少是因爲武裝不够。我們近來越戰越强，當然有種種要素，而最大原因，就是因爲抗戰兩年的經驗與敎訓，更增強了精神的力量。日本民衆們，爲欲判斷戰事的前途，不妨將奴方此較一下：你們軍閥除了武力之外，還悉什麽？你這侵略戰，在思想上有甚麽明確正當的理由，足以使得日本兵自證其犧牲的代價？實際上說，我們官兵每人都知道犧牲是　國，爲民爲主義；至少知道犧牲自己，就使得民族不做奴隸，國家不亡國？尤其知道，必有無數的後起者，繼續負責，以達最後勝利，所以這要犧牲，是光榮的，心安理得的，而你們呢？你們自命愛國，而結果却要禍國，現在侵略兩年了，越侵略越困難，不但前途茫茫，而且失敗日近，你們淸夜自問，中國自衛是不得已、日本的侵略、有甚麽不得已？從世界大勢上說，樅使亡華政策暫時成功，後來還有更大的戰爭，中國人民，終久不會屈服，終要出頒復興，何况現在已經嘗到中國堅强抗戰的滋味，斷斷沒有祉服中國的可能呢？我可以這樣說，中國兵確是爲國犧牲，日本兵只可說是爲軍閥犧牲，而結果是害國。要知犧牲的意義，是犧牲個人的利益，以換取國家民挨更高的利益，中國兵是這樣，日本兵則不然，因爲日本越侵略中國，自已越危險，所以日本士兵的作戰，不只是徒然送死，並且是自己死了，反而害了國家。眞愛國的日本民衆，冷靜的想一想，便不能不承認我的批評正當了、</p>
<p>日本民衆們，務須知道，一個民埃根本上只許爲自衛而戰，不容為侵略而戰，侵略的對象，若是一個無文化無政治而有滅亡之道的民族，或者還可以暫時成功，若無端侵略一個有文化有歷史的獨立國家，沒有不失敗的。何况以中日問題而言，中國雖弱，是有文化的大國，何況正是在革命途中的新興國家？而中國革命的主義，又決不侵害日本，並且有益於日本？那麼怎樣可以無端要消滅中國之獨立，而作這　的侵略戰呢！我可以這樣聲明，中國自開對是侵略，而中國絕對是自衛。何况除此之外，中國有三民主義確定的信仰，而日本沒有。固然，日本也有各種所謂主義，及不少的新標語，新名詞，但日本的主義，說穿内容、要之是侵略主義；最好的解釋、也超越不了民族的自私，而近來許多新標語新名詞，都是隨着侵略的進展而產生出來的，其意義，無非是使得中國的獨立消滅了，日本做征服者，而中國及其他東亞民族聽命于日本，所以這都是粉飾侵略戰爭的欺人之辭，根本上不是主機。從這一點說、中國不但有主義，並且主義好。因爲三民主義的中國之抗戰，是要達到救己而救人，利己而利人，我們所全力爭取者，是中國的自由平等，但同樣尊重日本的自由平等，這與日本侵略者以害人利己爲目的，而最後必然因害人反而害己的愚妄政策。比較起來，其在人類道德上的立場，義有霄壤之別了。我敢說；戰爭最後勝敗之分，但看彼此道德上的地位如何，我們有了絕對正義絕對有道德楊戚的抗戰理由及三民主義的信仰，而日本沒有，所以這一戰，我們在精神上先已佔着絕對勝利的地位了。這可以再補充說明一下：我們中國的軍事哲學與東方傳統的道德信條相貫通，中國講軍事，以道爲先，以法爲本；而且又是重義不重利，尙智不尚力，這四個要則，實在是我們東方古今戰史判斷勝利的最重要的定理；現在你們軍閥侵華之戰，是罔道違法，貪利而忘義，迷信暴力，抹殺理智，完全違反了道德與軍事的原則，而相比較，就可以知道我們中國，有必勝的把握，</p>
<p>說到這裏，日本有些人或者不服，因爲日本統治者常說，日本作戰是要解放中國，解放亞洲，這是道德根據嗎？我可以答復，你們更是受騙，本來關于「東亞新秩序」的謊言前面業已論到，這裏再駁斥兩點：</p>
<p>第一，中國只受到日本的侵略，幷沒受他國家的侵略，怎樣反而說侵略中國是解放中國？解放主義，等于自由；日本侵略者正全力摧毀中國民族政治的經濟的自由。反而說解放中國。顚倒是非，最可痛舌。</p>
<p>第二，你們軍閥說，中國受歐美的壓迫，是歐美半殖民地這完全是故意拿前淸時代情形來詛誣現代中國的言。近多年來，只見歐美國家對中國施行着和平政策。我國民政府執政以來，各團對中國的關係，一般的更有進步，互尊條約，各守信義，且一般對于中國的和平建設，表示局情，我們的主權幷不受歐美任何壓迫，誰也尊重我們是獨立國家。所以你們軍閥所謂中國是半殖民地的口號，完全是侵害各國在華通商利益，和煽動日本無知民衆，以便利他進攻中國之一種欺騙的宣傳，完全不管事實。說到前世紀以來，中國與各國的條的關係，這多年來本已改善了不少。自我國民政府執政以來，卽决定以和平信義的外交，謀一切問題之漸進的解决，而因爲各關係國家，都是和平的信義的，所以若不是日本從九一八以來侵略中國，打擊中國，則相信中國改正條約，早已成功無疑了，近來日本軍閥壓迫津滬等處租界，這些租界問題，只有中國政府有構與關係國家討論。日本進攻租界，就是蹂躪各關係國的權利，同時是蔑視中國國家的主權，而其目的在占　租界，以蹂躪中國居民，掠奪中國利益，所以完全爲侵略中國，並侵略各國的非法舉動，將以加緊的奴隸中國，怎樣能造謠是解放中國？</p>
<p>簡單的一句話，你們日本軍閥的政策，是征服中國，而我們全國軍民奮鬥的目標，就是要從日本侵略之下，自求解放，你們軍閥那些顚倒黑白的宣傳，怎樣也騙不了中國人與全世界人，只是若干日本民衆，或者不明事實而已。說到解放亞洲，更可笑了；中國是全亞洲最大的獨立國家，你們無端要征他，怎樣還說解放亞洲，對于大中國尙且如此摧殘，那麽對子其他弱小國家的居心如何，還値得討論嗎？簡單說，解放亞洲，就是征服亞洲，其目的就是要把亞洲民族，都解放成滿洲偽國成朝鮮一樣，征服者做主人，被征服者做奴隷，我可以說這企圖實在雄大，只可惜永無實現的可能或機會而已。</p>
<p>話說囘來：據上面所設，可知日本軍閥在道德上完全失敗，中國業已取得精神的勝利。現在要接着說明：爲甚麽精神的勝利，就能成功實際的勝利．那麽要知道，作戰第一靠人，一切都靠人，而中國抗戰，因爲絕對是自動，是信仰三民主義，所以凡關子人的問，一切解决了。全中國今天只有一個意志，一個工作：——就是抗戰建國。而抗戰的目的與理由，每一個中國人都十分瞭然，所多餘者，只是技術問題，物質問題，而國家戰時及戰後政治上與經濟上的方針，又早巳確定，所以全中國今天根本上全無爭論的問題，只是努力工作而已。</p>
<p>固然，×人佔領了我們地方不少，而在占領區域內的中國人民，其精神意志，依然永遠擁護國家，絕不會受×人欺騙。至于少數漢奸叛逆，是民族的敗類，一點也影響不到全民族的精神意志。反而日本軍閥越企圖以華制華，越使中國民族感覺侮辱，而增強决心。一言蔽之，我們是寧靜的，並且是樂觀的。歷史命定下來，惟一的一條艱苦而光明的道路，我們只有努力去走，甚麽艱苦鄱能當受，甚麽犧都不當難。因爲今天的受苦，是過去努力不够的報答。同時今天的犧牲，便準是未來光榮幸福的保障。我們因爲感覺這共同的責任，保持這一致的信仰，所以環境雖是駭浪驚濤，而心情却如光星霽月，這種情形，是侵略國所斷斷最不到的。老實說罷，中國關于人的問題之解决，本來十分困難，特別是茍安自私的心理，極不容易去除。然抗戰以來，一般國民，因爲對于忠勇將士的感覺及所受國破家亡的痛苦，積極的使得精神意志達於高潮；消極的使得茍安自私天然消滅。我敢說，現在我們全軍官兵及應徵入伍的壯丁，與在南北戰區間接直接做着各項抗戰工作的一般同胞同志，還有在前方後方，努力於交通運輸生產製造的技術人員；與一般最工同胞，其精神意志進步的程度。若在平時二十年也做不到。而我們敎育學術工商實業各界的各部人才，與一般男女學生靑年，這兩年來都是精誠刻苦。突飛猛進。因此深深感到。我們民族的偉大，確證了我們國家的前途的光明，因為作戰是人，而人的問題我們已操縱他人優勢。而技術可以進步。物質可以補充。我們爲甚麽不能打？爲甚麽不能勝？當然，日軍的武器裝備，比我們大的多；但是我們有把握的，要使我們這一天比一天小，並且使得×人有武裝而無用。何况你們的思想敵國甚多，而我們只是一個×人。所以你們越侵略中國，則國際地位越低落，越危險；而我們則只打這一次仗，你們四面楚歌。我們則世界爲友，最後孰成孰敗，可以不言而喩了。</p>
<p>我今天對你們日本民衆說這一番話，是代表中國民族，根據兩民族歷史的友誼，與三民主義的使命，以愛吾國亦愛敵民的精神，而致其至誠的勸吿。但同時聲明，你們如依然從軍閥，中國亦絕對不受影響，我們站着道德的立場，擁着無盡的人力，以絕對一致的三民主義的信仰，抗戰建國同時並進。内有掌固團結的民心，外有友邦公論的援助，爲甚麽不能打倒這東亞民族共同×人呢？你們的武力萬能，我們三民主義是百鐵金鋼，最後看究竟是武力勝，還是道德勝。我不備作預言，將來自有事實爲證明！</p>
<p>四結論</p>
<p>以上各　，說得大槪已經很詳　了！而我所說「中國自衛的成功，並不是日本民衆的失敗。閱侵略政策的失敗，這正是日本民衆的成功。」信個理由，大槪諸君也可以領會了，現在總括起來，再奉贈諸君數言。</p>
<p>中日是與鄰國，在文化上自古有深厚的因緣。這個事實，是我們本來重視的。我們三民主義的信徒，以眾界大同爲理想，本無人種或地域的偏見。而對於鄰近民族。當然希望和好，因此之故，我們難然在血戰之中，感情上不曾×視日本民衆，並因爲深信諸君之中，一定明白人很多。只是認識不淸，上了軍閥宣傳的當，所以我今天掬職奉官，明辦是非，這完全出於我們民族與主義道德的　意，至於我所勸告者，第一，要澈底　悔錯誤，第二，要澈底改變政策。</p>
<p>你們軍閥要亡中國，絕對是錯誤的．你們務須認識建立强盛的大中華民國之存在，正是日本絕對的利益。因此中國强盛了，東亞和平就眞正確保了。而能得到這和平的利益者，第一就是日本。反過來說，假若中國此次不堅泠抗戰，而變成日本殖民地；試問你們誤認爲巳經奴化了兩千萬朝鮮人民，和四百萬台灣人民，不都在待機反擄的嗎？若更加上四萬五千萬中國人民，因被征服，而對日本懷着無窮的憤恨，償管你們發揮一切奴化毒化的摧殘，而悠久深厚有根底的中國文化和民族精神，是决不能根本消滅去的！這樣的時候，就要你們幾千萬日本人民，受着軍閥統治，天天備戰或作戰，政治經濟一天天惡劣，最後一個大風波，日本當然完全崩潰了，而中國和朝鮮，仍舊可乘這根會復興起來。所以你們軍閥的侵略結策很害人害己，禍中國亦禍日本，所以你們政府的所興亞院。其意義來本是亡華院；而結果恐怕要變成「亡日院」。從這一點上說，中國的抗戰，實在大有這於日本。因爲藉中國抗戰之力，足以打破你們軍閥武力萬能的迷夢，同時就是給日本民衆一個很好的機會，可以把日本從重大危機中拯救出來。因此我勸諸君，從速醒覺，從速懺悔，從速積極自救，我們中國軍民今天所恃以與×人周旋者，是大仁與大勇，站起來雖傾日本舉國之師，以攻中國，我們反而愈戰愈堅，而同時說利仁，則看日本民衆所受前痛苦，就等於我們自己的痛苦，世界變化正在猛進，我勸你們萬不要錯過了這自救的機會！</p>
<p>至於怎樣自救？首先就需要澈底改變對華政策，澈底放棄侵略。我可以吿訴你們，必須確切承認並尊重中國是一個有神聖主權的獨立國家，同我們看日本一樣，而凡關國家主權。一點也不容含糊，含糊就只有打仗，何况還想永占我國土，及組織漢奸僞政府嗎？我勸你們必須認識三民主義的新中國之獨立生存與發展，並不因日本武力侵略而受其障碍，最後吃虧者，只有日本自己。同時讓你們趕緊恢復東方道德，並認識三民主義的眞價。孫中山先生提倡忠孝仁愛信義和平的東方道德，其中之仁愛信義和平，就是我們國際政策的基本，奉勸你們也這樣改正過來，至少從此不要說欺騙的話。凡用一名詞，都照本着解釋，不要欺騙。而我們尊重日本國家與人民的人格，你們也愿當同樣尊重中國，不要汚辱中國。</p>
<p>最後復述我去年所說的話：「中國軍民對于愛好和平。深受軍閥壓迫之諸君，始終認爲利害共同之良友，關懷挾滿腔之熱情與期待。深望諸君省泰兩國安危之至計，團結一致，反對强暴軍部之一切施爲，發揮貴國國民之正義的意志與力量！」</p>
<p>日本民眾諸君！我相信你們必能記着，並理解我去年今日正吿你們的話。我盼望你們認淸你們國家民族的的人，並不在中國，也不在在世界，而在日本，被請相信，請諸君三思！（中央社）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Re-examination of Japanese Policy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On July 6th, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma delivered a speech comprehensively outlining the Japanese government's domestic and foreign policies, with the following points being the most important:</p>
<p>First, strengthening the anti-communist axis. He said: "Strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact is an established policy, and we must continue to follow this policy. Japan may send representatives to the Nazi Party Congress in Germany." The fact that Japan continues to cling to this "anti-communist" magic wand precisely illustrates the increasingly serious and intractable difficulties Japan faces. It is forced to use this "anti-communist" magic wand to both intensify its collusion with Germany and Italy, obtaining political and military assistance from them in the West, and to confuse democratic powers such as Britain and the United States, seeking avenues for compromise, dividing the anti-aggression front, and weakening the forces supporting China and restraining Japan.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the attitude towards countries opposing aggression, Hiranuma's speech reveals the contradictions and cunning of Japan's recent policies. He adopts a seductive approach towards the United States, even brazenly saying: "The atmosphere in the United States is improving, which can be observed." However, in reality, as Japan's aggressive forces expand in the Far East, the conflict between its interests and those of the United States is increasing daily, no less than its conflict with Britain. Although a small number of isolationists and arms merchants in the United States deliberately ignore this, the fact remains. The United States will eventually reject this flirtatious gesture and take self-defense measures. Secondly, regarding the Soviet Union, Hiranuma said: "The Nomonhan Incident was only intended to drive out Mongolian troops who had crossed the border, nothing more." This even more blatantly exposes the shamelessness and powerlessness of the Japanese aggressors! While he shamelessly trumpets anti-communism, he also exposes his fear of the Mongolian and Soviet forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party, who are fighting back against Japan. It seems that the traitors who follow Japan in shamelessly "opposing the Soviet Union" and "opposing communism" should wake up a little. How has the motherland failed you that you must sell your souls to be the shameless and powerless lackeys of Japan?</p>
<p>Third, Japan is currently concentrating all its forces against Britain! If Japan truly wants to oppose communism, then Japan's enemy should be the Soviet Union. If it is for the future situation in the Pacific, then Japan's strong opponent is the United States, not Britain! If Japan wants to strike at countries that aid China's resistance against Japan, then the countries most actively aiding China today are the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. It can even be said that in the past two years, Britain's aid to China has never exceeded that of the Soviet Union and the United States. However, Japan today does not attack its main "true" enemies, but chooses Britain, which has the most moderate attitude, the most cautious behavior, and even shows deference to Japan in its diplomacy! Hiranuma said: "Japan will pursue its goals with firm resolve and resolutely reject all obstacles. If Britain does not understand Japan's intentions or does not agree with Japan's views, there is no other option but to sever relations." At the same time, an anti-British movement is being launched throughout Japan and its occupied areas in China. Here again, we see Japan's fear of the strong! We also see that the fate of any country that attempts to compromise with Japan is simply to retreat voluntarily and even become a sacrifice for Japan.</p>
<p>Fourth, on the China issue, Hiranuma did not dare to mention a single word about the current state of the war of aggression and its future when announcing his policies. This proves how Japan is currently trapped in an unprecedentedly difficult situation because of our insistence on unity and resistance! However, Hiranuma particularly emphasized the establishment of a puppet new central government in the occupied areas. In order to strengthen this new regime, dreaming of colluding with a small number of wavering elements, stubborn elements, and a small number of people who have abandoned their conscience, betrayed their country for personal gain, and are willing to be buried with the enemy, he announced that the Three Principles of the People and the Kuomintang, which are anti-communist, might be allowed under the puppet new regime. In order to consolidate the rule of the occupied areas and facilitate its oppression and plunder of the occupied areas, he also resolutely declared the semi-permanent stationing of troops.</p>
<p>Hiranuma's announced future policies of Japan, on the one hand, exposed the severity of the blows that Japan's war of aggression against China has suffered in the past two years, and revealed that Japan's own strength is no longer able to solve its current difficulties and crises. But on the other hand, it also revealed that Japan is trying to intensify its efforts to eliminate all British forces from its occupied areas and seize all British wealth. It wants to take all of China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to solve its difficulties. In order to realize this ambition, it shamelessly fawns on the United States and yields to the Soviet Union. It does not hesitate to unscrupulously use the magic flag of anti-communism to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord. However, precisely because of this, it further exposes the approaching end of Japan!</p>
<p>Chinese compatriots who are unwilling to be slaves, let us enhance our national self-esteem and self-confidence!</p>

<h3 id="e2">The enemy's forces are increasingly pressured on all battlefields. The main focus of the war is now on the coastal provinces of Shanxi and Guangdong. Enemy warships harassing are not a major threat. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] A Chinese military spokesman said yesterday that after two years of hard fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies, the current confrontation line starts from Baotou, the end point of the Ping-Sui Railway in the north, extends south along the east bank of the Yellow River to Yongji, then runs parallel to the river, east to Kaifeng, then turns south, passing through Xuchang on the Ping-Han Railway, and reaches Qianjiang on the Han River along the railway, then south to Yueyang, before turning east to Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, then north along the Nan (chang)-Ping (jiang) highway to Jiujiang. As for Zhejiang Province, although the Japanese army once advanced south, it can now only hold the highway between Wuhu and Hangzhou. Regarding Guangdong Province, the Japanese army only controls 100 kilometers around Guangzhou. The West River and North River serve as natural moats between the two armies. There are no traces of the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. In Shantou, the Japanese army is now attacking the border between Fujian and Guangdong. The spokesman also said that the above is only the battle line on the surface. In fact, the Japanese army can only hold important transportation lines. Outside the transportation lines, Chinese officials can still exercise their functions, and guerrillas often attack the rear of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Tension at the southern end of the Tongpu Railway. Fierce fighting near Anyi and Zhangdian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] The enemy in Dongduan Village, Anyi, was attacked by our troops in the rain on the night of the 3rd, and there was fierce street fighting. The next morning, the enemy in Anyi was informed and sent reinforcements, and the fighting was even fiercer. More than 200 enemies were killed. Currently, our troops are besieging.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] More than 1,000 enemy infantry and cavalry who invaded from Anze were severely attacked head-on by our division west of Niegu Shop. Another unit of our army intercepted them in Shangyuan Baofeng (southeast of Zhangdian Town) and other places, killing many enemies. The remaining enemies have joined with the enemy in the southwestern area of Zouma Ridge to attack Qin Yuan. We are on high alert.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] More than 2,000 enemies from Hongdong, near the suburbs, recently advanced east through Gu Xian Town and Taiyang Town. After our fierce attack, more than 300 enemies were killed in the two days of the 3rd and 4th. They are still fighting fiercely near Xiluling (northeast of Fushan).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 8th] More than 2,000 enemies from Zhangjing Town (north of Qin County) captured Qin County in the morning of the 5th and continued to attack Shihe Village on the west side through Duanliu Fan Village. After an interception by our troops, there was fierce fighting for half a day, and the enemy was defeated and retreated. Another 700 to 800 enemies captured Yikai Village and Guo Village (south of Qin County) and attempted to attack Guo Dao. We have strengthened our reconnaissance and defense.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Kelan, 9th] More than 3,000 enemies in Shuoxian, Shenchi, Naihe Fort, Laoying Fort, and other places in northwestern Shanxi attacked our Bajiao Fort and Limin Fort (north of Shenchi) in five routes. Our army was already aware of the enemy's situation and had withdrawn its troops to nearby highlands for an ambush. On the evening of the 1st, the enemy invaded Limin Fort and, knowing that we were prepared, did not dare to stop and immediately retreated eastward. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, killing dozens of enemies. Because the enemy had not yet gained a firm foothold, they collapsed from the Shuoxian area. By the evening of the 2nd, there were no enemies near Limin Fort.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Yulin, 9th] More than 500 enemies who occupied Guangcheng from Changning Town (east of Yuci) have been retreating from the Yuci area after being constantly attacked by our army in recent days.</p>
<p>The southeastern coast is consolidated. Our army successfully counterattacks Houtang.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guilin, 9th, special dispatch] A military source said that the national defense on the southeastern coast is absolutely consolidated. The coast is mostly hilly. Even if the enemy lands, they have no hope of penetrating deeply. In the Chaoshan battle, we have gradually taken the initiative. The enemy in Chaoshan is being attacked by us everywhere on the road and is in a dilemma whether to advance or retreat. Although there are many enemy warships off the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang, only Dinghai, Shijiao, Renhuan, Chuanshi, Pingtan Islands are being harassed. This does not cause any military damage to us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 8th] The enemy who sneaked into Shijiao Town, which belongs to Wenling County, has been building fortifications in recent days, intending to hold on. At 1:00 p.m. on the 8th, our army launched a large-scale counterattack. The enemy resisted stubbornly. After our fierce attack, the enemy was defeated. Some retreated back to the ships, and about 200 enemies fled to Ruoshan. There are now no traces of the enemy in Shijiao. There are one large enemy ship, three small ships, and two ships each in the waters of Huangdaao and Xiaomenshan. There are three to five ships in the waters of Damenshan.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Intense fighting on the Mongolian border. 60,000 Soviet troops reinforce the front line. There is a battle for Hailar. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Reuters correspondent on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, 9th: The battle between the Manchurian-Japanese and Mongolian-Soviet forces for Nomonhan on the border is becoming more intense. Both sides are now fighting for a certain mountain, and the scale of the battle is reminiscent of the Zhanggufeng Incident last year. The two sides are attacking each other with aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery. The mountain that is being fought for is 160 miles southwest of Hailar. The summit of the mountain is the target of both sides and has not yet been occupied by either side. Mongolian troops are braving heavy artillery fire to defend the ridge on the west side of the mountain. At the same time, some other Mongolian troops are divided into several small teams and are braving Japanese artillery fire to cross the Halha River to reinforce the Mongolian troops who are defending near Nomonhan. It is reported that the hills on the banks of the Halha River have been surrounded by the Japanese army. The war situation has turned into trench warfare, with both sides digging trenches and confronting each other. The Japanese side said that the Mongolian army is now making every effort to counterattack, and its combat plan has not yet been completed. Although the Mongolian army has suffered heavy bombing by the Japanese army, it is still able to use the large bridge of Halha to cross 4,000 reinforcements across the bridge in the dark. The reporter now sees several trucks full of Japanese wounded soldiers going down from the front line, which proves the intensity of the war. The Mongolian army has been reinforced by the Soviet troops and has taken a firm stand. Therefore, the war seems likely to be prolonged. According to senior Japanese military officers, 60,000 Soviet troops have been transferred from the Lake Baikal area (in the eastern part of Siberia) to the rear of the border to be stationed. As for the rumors that the Soviet Union intends to launch another battle elsewhere on the border to alleviate the crisis in the Nomonhan area, it is clearly inaccurate. The reason why the Japanese army made little progress at the beginning of the war was due to the difficulty of transportation and the lack of mechanized units. Currently, mechanized and infantry units have been reinforced. The most noteworthy things in the current war are two: one is the accuracy of the Soviet artillery fire, and the other is the intensity of the Japanese aircraft bombing. The Japanese side claims that since the outbreak of the war, it has destroyed 250 Mongolian tanks and armored vehicles and captured about 60 Soviet troops. Because the transportation to the front is inconvenient, the reporter cannot confirm the war results reported by the Japanese side.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The 9th was the anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking of the National Revolutionary Army. The Central National Government jointly held a memorial meeting at 8:00 a.m. More than 400 members of the Central National Government Committee and military and political leaders attended. President Chiang presided in person and performed the ceremony. Subsequently, Committee Member Wu Jingheng reported on the significance of completing the national revolution in the 30th year of the Premier's guidance. His words were insightful and vigilant. After the meeting, President Chiang held a tea party to entertain the military and political leaders to celebrate.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Weng Wenhao talks about the current economic situation in China. At present, agriculture is more important than industry, focusing on self-sufficiency. The blockade of the coast has no impact on the overall situation. <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Mr. Smith, the Far East President of our agency, met with Chinese Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao today and was given a statement, which roughly said that regarding the number of foreign goods imported, China still relies on foreigners for many types of goods, especially munitions. However, China now has a large reserve of arms, which is enough to support it for a long time even if it stops buying now. Moreover, the current war situation is not tense, and less is needed. Regarding the economic development of the southwestern provinces of China, especially the industrial development, Minister Weng said that the industrial development is not extremely important, because most of the people are farmers, and industry is secondary. As for the provinces west of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, such as Ningxia, because the land is barren, the residents do not need to transport goods in and out, and they are self-sufficient. Because transportation is difficult, most of them have not been developed. The Long Province is gradually becoming an important province because of the Sino-Soviet highway. As for the recent so-called "Berglas Plan" to relocate German Jews to Yunnan Province, Minister Weng said that although the government has indeed considered the issue of relocating Jewish refugees, it has not yet decided on any implementation plan. Minister Weng then admitted that the Japanese army's blockade of Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and other places has had a considerable impact on trade in these places, but said that the number of Chinese goods exported from these places is not large, so it has little impact on the overall situation. Now Annam and Burma are the necessary routes for imported goods. Although the handling of transportation is not perfect, it has been greatly improved and is gradually becoming better. Britain and France have also expressed their willingness to cooperate with China to improve the handling of transportation because of commercial relations. The Northwest Highway is only used to connect trade between China and the Soviet Union, so goods from other countries are not transported into China through this route. The reporter then asked whether the Japanese were able to extract resources in the occupied areas. Minister Weng said that the Japanese now have very little access to resources in the occupied areas, and their goal is in the future, attempting to control the entire Chinese economy. Therefore, the capital of the two major development companies in North China and Central China is borne by Chinese and Japanese merchants, but the real power is in the hands of the Japanese. The Japanese plan to control the entire Chinese economy with these two major companies when the war ends in the future. However, the Japanese financial groups and warlords cannot agree on their opinions and are dissatisfied with the economic facilities in the occupied areas. Now Chinese merchants in the occupied areas can still avoid the Japanese army's surveillance and transport a large number of goods into the inland. Regarding the indiscriminate bombing of various places by Japanese aircraft, Minister Weng finally said that this matter has no impact on Chinese industry, because the factories are scattered in various places and are not large in scale. Therefore, even if one or two of them are bombed, it does not matter.</p>

<h3 id="e8">American Catholic Journalists' Annual Meeting. Bishop Yu Bin's speech denounces Japanese atrocities in China. The whole audience applauded and expressed deep sympathy. <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] New York News: The 29th annual meeting of the American Catholic News Journalists Association was held in New York on June 22. Representatives from Catholic news organizations in various cities attended, totaling more than 150. The opening address was given by Archbishop Spellman of New York, who praised and encouraged the work in the past and in the future. The chairman then introduced Bishop Yu Bin's speech, and the whole audience applauded in welcome. Bishop Yu delivered a sincere speech, roughly saying that Catholic newspapers are praised by the world because they adhere to the three major principles of "justice," "humanity," and "truth." If these three major principles are applied to the injustice, inhumanity, hypocrisy, and fraud in society, they can be eliminated before they happen. The benefits to the world and people's hearts cannot be measured. Now in the East, there is a great power with 450 million people and a 5,000-year-old history. Its cities and towns have been tragically bombed, and no fewer than 30 million of its people have been displaced. The suffering of women and children is especially tragic. How can you turn a blind eye to this? The enemy breaks into homes and robs, ravages women, and it has not stopped yet. Its destruction of human culture is unprecedented. As for controlling public opinion and fabricating news, it is secondary. The term "Far East" is a European term. In fact, the distance from England is not far. What is being done to us today, who knows that it will not be done to the United States tomorrow? You uphold justice, advocate humanitarianism, and support the truth. You have been doing this for a long time. I hope that you will, with human sympathy and Catholic charity, expand the scope of reporting and commentary, and denounce the conspiracies of the Japanese military with both words and actions. Awaken the world to the arbitrary Sino-Japanese War. It is not a simple corner of the army, but a key to whether the world will move toward peace or war in the next thousand years. It also concerns civilization and barbarism. After the speech, the whole audience applauded warmly, expressing deep sympathy. Several well-known reporters continued to elaborate on the first theory. The first day's meeting ended successfully. The annual meeting continued the next day. Bishop Yu Bin introduced Zhang Shanzi to participate, so that the news media could understand our country's art. Zhang also brought many paintings, which were given away to the audience, and the audience praised them.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Guizhou's Volunteer Soldiers <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhuzhou</p>
<p>[Guizhou Correspondence] When the Southern Route delegation of the National Comfort Association entered Guizhou, everyone was excited about one thing. This thing was the rise of a trend of voluntarily enlisting in the military among the strong young men in every corner of Guizhou.</p>
<p>The young men who voluntarily enlist are called "volunteer soldiers" in the classification of the military service authorities.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the local military district headquarters, as of the end of May, the counties where young men had voluntarily enlisted included Danjiang, Libo, Tongzi, Xiuwen, Xifeng, Zunyi, Qingzhen, Xingren, Jiangkou, Zhengan, Zhengyuan, Jiyang, Anyun, Lushun, Pingba, Guanling, Panxian, and other counties, totaling 298 people. Among them, 231 were general voluntary enlistees; 54 were serving in place of their brothers; 66 were students; 4 were members of the Miao ethnic group; 2 were brothers competing to serve in the military; and 1 was a monk. All have been commended by the authorities or given bonuses and certificates.</p>
<p>Since there are students, Miao people, and monks among the young men who voluntarily enlist, it can be seen how deeply the trend of volunteer soldiers in Guizhou has penetrated into all levels of society, all villages, and all remote mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Everyone should not think that these 298 people are too small a number and not pay attention to it. All trends are gradually formed. Taking Libo County as an example, because the Song Dengbang brothers competed to serve in the military, the news spread, and as many as 11 people volunteered to enlist.</p>
<p>The reasons for the rise of the trend of volunteer soldiers in Guizhou are: (1) It is due to prior publicity. The local military district has organized ten propaganda teams that regularly tour various counties to carry out various propaganda activities. (2) It is effective because of post-event encouragement. Administrative agencies at all levels, all schools, all organizations, and even all sectors of the public, hold enthusiastic farewell parties whenever young men voluntarily enlist, and the Provincial Women's Sports Committee also organizes women's comfort teams to frequently visit them. (3) It succeeds because young men follow suit. The general public has accepted the propaganda and is ashamed of being comfortable and happy to go to difficulties. They also feel that asking for a gun and killing the enemy is a supreme honor. Naturally, the idea of following suit arises in their minds.</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Dingchang said to his subordinates on New Year's Day this year: "This year's work, military service is the first." Recently, he himself has been constantly going to Qian East, Qian South, Qian North, and drought-stricken areas to inspect military service work and attend military service military training meetings, which shows his importance to military service.</p>
<p>Now, military service sections have been widely established in various counties, and the military service work in the province has made amazing achievements.</p>
<p>In short, the compatriots of Guizhou, who have always been known as "the people have no three cents of silver," have made their best efforts and achieved the best results on the military service issue, which has become a major factor in supporting the war. It is hoped that the trend of volunteer soldiers can quickly spread throughout the country, making the invaders tremble before us. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Anti-War Sword</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese war has only lasted two years, and the flaws in Japan's interior are being exposed more and more every day. In addition to the news that we often see in the newspapers about mass suicides by Japanese soldiers, explosions of ammunition depots, and mutinies in various places, which are all gratifying and commendable news, the reporter also received a letter from a friend, Mr. Fan Jack, who actually participated in the war, which also describes the serious facts related to leaflets in the Japanese army. Mr. Fan used to work in the news industry, but he joined the military academy in his early years, so since the War of Resistance, he joined the XXX Army as a company commander. He said in his letter:</p>
<p>"During the Battle of Taierzhuang, the quality of the soldiers was very good. They were all young people in their twenties, and they did not retreat even after fierce fighting. Their advantages can be seen. However, the recent soldiers are a mixture of young and old. At the beginning of the battle, they often abandoned their weapons and fled, and some even wailed and sobbed. Senior commanders had no choice but to strictly organize supervision teams to try to remedy the situation, so infighting and killing each other was also common.</p>
<p>"The XXX War Zone, which is famous for the scenery of Jiangnan, has been constantly flying with drizzle recently. We arrived here, just in time for Jiangxi XX County to be recovered by our XX Division. We picked up three kinds of anti-war leaflets from the Japanese army on the edge of the city, all in fluent Japanese, with the following Chinese translations:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, to enslave China is like a dream!"</p>
<p>"It is better to be a dog than to sacrifice ourselves for this invasion!"</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, do you know where the funds in the Tokyo treasury have gone!"</p>
<p>"The above three anti-war slogans, which are like sharp swords deeply inserted into the minds of Japanese soldiers, are all signed "Volunteers of the South China Expeditionary Army." We judged from the grammar, font, paper quality, and printing that these leaflets definitely came from Japan. The internal political chaos in Japan, the decline of the soldiers' will to fight, and the pervasive anti-war atmosphere can all be seen from this."</p>
<p>Mr. Fan's original letter is very long, but just the above paragraph alone has already outlined a profound picture of all the internal contradictions of Japan using a metaphor.</p>
<p>I would also like to summarize with one sentence: The many leaflets that the Japanese army spread to us on the northern battlefield had no effect at all, and the anti-war giant scorpion brewing inside them is so formidable. We only need to continue our efforts on the front line of the War of Resistance for a considerable period of time, and then their tragedy of military, political, and economic collapse will immediately continue to be staged! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Japan Launches an Anti-British Frenzy Arita Emphasizes Domination of China Tokyo Thugs Threaten British Envoy <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The criticism of future Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident by the Japanese political and press circles has become increasingly sharp. Major General Muto, the leader of the Japanese delegation, told the press that Japan would raise the broad issue of foreign concessions. Muto said that Japan's military operations in China "have been constantly hampered by the activities of anti-Japanese elements in foreign concessions for the past two years," and specifically mentioned Shanghai and Tianjin, calling Tianjin "the center of Communist activities and incitement in North China." Muto concluded that "peace" is impossible without strict control of the British concession. Representatives of Japanese "patriotic" groups used even tougher tones. The "National Federation of Workers and Peasants" paraded in front of the British Embassy and sent a resolution to the U.S. Embassy, warning Britain that "Britain's anti-Japanese attitude during the Sino-Japanese War is sufficient to hinder peace in the Far East." The resolution also strongly stated that the "national people" of Japan are determined to support the government and the military, and demanded that Britain fundamentally change its Far Eastern policy. Tokyo "student" groups also sent similar demands to British Ambassador Craigie. Tokyo newspapers said that the negotiations would be a turning point in Anglo-Japanese relations. One newspaper, "Yomiuri Shimbun," called Britain "Japan's biggest enemy" and said that "eliminating Britain's potential power in the Far East is beneficial to mankind and justice." The newspaper also strongly criticized domestic pro-British politicians, financiers, diplomats, and university professors as "abominable." (Haitong News Agency, Milan, 9th) The Italian "Il Popolo d'Italia's" correspondent in Tokyo, in an audience with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, stated that Japan had decided to establish a "new order" in the Far East, and that Japan would be hostile to any third country that attempted to undermine Japan's implementation of this policy. Japan is determined to "prosper" East Asia, but believes that it cannot thoroughly implement this plan as long as China remains a "semi-colony." The recent Tianjin incident was caused by the fact that foreign concessions in China are the base for anti-Japanese "terrorists." Therefore, the issue of lifting the blockade depends on the situation. Arita then reiterated the declaration of former Prime Minister Konoe, saying that Japan "respects" China's sovereignty and that "the Japanese government is now considering abolishing extraterritoriality in China."</p>
<p>Japan Continues to Kowtow to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 7th] Although conflicts occur from time to time on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo," Japan and the Soviet Union still maintain normal diplomatic relations. When Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky yesterday, the discussion was limited to the dispute between the Sakhalin Island Japanese merchant oil and coal mining company and the Soviet trade union, and no other matters were mentioned. Regarding this matter, the Soviet court fined the company 630,000 rubles because the goods supplied by the company to Soviet workers were inferior to those stipulated in the contract. Now the Japanese government has also acknowledged the Soviet side's accusations, but has requested a reduction in the fine.</p>
<p>France and the Netherlands Emphasize the Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Paris, 8th) The development of the Far Eastern situation is being closely watched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to reports received here, when British and Japanese authorities conduct negotiations in Tokyo, the Japanese side intends to discuss the Tianjin British Concession incident and also involve the current system of general concessions. If this is true, the United States and France should step forward to negotiate in order to avoid setting a precedent that would be detrimental in the future.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, The Hague, 8th] According to well-informed sources, Queen Wilhelmina's intervention in the Dutch government's cabinet crisis was due to the tense international situation and the desire to quickly resolve the cabinet's difficulties. The Queen not only invited the speakers of both houses of parliament and the vice-president of the Privy Council to participate in the consultations, but also the former Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Jonkheer and the Chief of General Staff of the Army and Navy were invited. The participation of senior military officials in the meeting led political circles to speculate that the development of the Dutch military position and the Far Eastern situation will have a decisive impact on the formation of the new government. General public opinion is deeply satisfied with the Queen's move. "De Telegraaf" speaks for public opinion, stating that for the sake of national interests and overseas property, all domestic opinions must be abandoned. Public hope is that Prime Minister Dr. Colijn is undoubtedly the most outstanding politician in the Netherlands and will be empowered to overcome all obstacles and form a new government.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 9th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the British and French ambassadors and British special envoy Strang for two hours yesterday afternoon, but the results have not been announced by either side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The British and French ambassadors and British diplomatic envoy Strang met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lotov this evening for two hours and fifteen minutes. Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Bodankin was also present. Negotiations are continuing and another meeting is expected soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again received British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Foreign Office envoy Strang today, and the talks lasted about two hours.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] According to the naval correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," the British Navy's massive shipbuilding program is being intensified. As a result, a new fleet will be launched in a few months. Three cruisers will be launched simultaneously within two days next week, including the Marignia and the Dido on the 18th, and the Mauritius on the 19th. The Riginia and Mauritius are both 8,000 tons, while the Dido is 5,000 tons. In the following months, the 35,000-ton Duke of York and Batti, and the 23,000-ton aircraft carriers Victoria and Formidable will be launched. After that, there will be four cruisers and a number of destroyers and submarines that will be launched one after another. In general, this summer's naval magnetism can be said to have reached its peak, and there is still the possibility of further intensification in the future.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The U.S. government is now planning to restore President Roosevelt's old trick of dealing with a certain number of senators last year. Secretary of State Hull and other senior government officials have taken action to persuade Senators Gillette and George to vote in favor of the government's neutrality bill. Of the 23 members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 11 support President Roosevelt's proposals. All the others, except Gillette and George, are opposed, while the attitude of the two is hesitant and they have stated that they have not yet decided how to vote on the Neutrality Act. The Foreign Relations Committee will meet on Tuesday to decide on the form of the Neutrality Act to be submitted to the Senate. The government now believes that the bill can be successfully passed in the Senate, but it is afraid of even the slightest chance of failure, which lies with the Foreign Relations Committee.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] According to a report from the Berlin Announcement Office today, the number of people being called up in Germany will reach 400,000. Those being called up are those who have not received any military service and were born in 1906, 1907, 1910, and 1913 to 1920. They will go for inspection between July 7th and September 9th of this year. The announcement only said that the personnel being called up will engage in labor service or military service. It is expected that young people will engage in labor service. Military officers said that this move is purely normal, but the crowds watching the announcement, given the speed of the call-up and the large number of people being called up, are predicting one after another. Everyone believes that September 9th, the deadline for the call-up, may be a major day. According to the current planned procedure, that time coincides with the last day of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg Congress. (Reuters, Rome, 8th) Italy's next year's budget (until next June) is still short of 60 million pounds. A quarter of the entire budget will be used for national defense.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] Observers here recently stated that the Danzig issue has now returned to temporary calm, but Germany may take action on the Slovak State. This can be seen from the German authorities' decision to immediately repair all military highways in the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. In addition, the German army is conducting large-scale exercises in the central region, and other departments also seem to be actively preparing militarily. In view of these various actions, it is not unfounded to worry. As for the city of Danzig, the situation has eased, and it may not change within a certain period of time. This can be seen from the fact that the German head of state has gone to rest at the Berghof villa in Berchtesgaden, and Polish President Moscicki has also left the capital to spend the summer. In general, after the British and French authorities issued a firm statement, if the Danzig issue is attempted to be resolved by violence, it is difficult to hope that it will be a local event. In addition, German wheat is ripe and will soon begin to be harvested. It is not suitable for a large-scale action during this busy farming season. All of these factors are well-known to the German authorities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 8th] The situation in Danzig remains unchanged. Coastal defenses are being actively improved. A large number of Polish dockworkers have been dismissed. The Nazi Party newspaper said that the construction being carried out on the coast is to build a "children's playground."</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Inseparable Fate of Europe and Asia <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— London Correspondence, Shu Di</p>
<p>(1) A Very Clear Example</p>
<p>The inseparable fate of Europe and Asia could not be more powerfully illustrated than by these two recent events. The first was a little over two weeks ago when the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement was the talk of the town. Suddenly, Japan in the Far East created a tense situation on the Mongolian border. The meaning was clear: in the event that Britain directly formed a full military alliance with Soviet Russia, it would have to first consider the possibility of being drawn into war with Japan. The British government immediately sensed this intention, but most reactions were dismissive. Britain had much larger considerations in mind regarding the importance of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. At the time, it seemed that Japan, perhaps combined with Franco's Spain, did not weigh as heavily as Turkey on the scales of the British government's considerations regarding whether or not to ally with the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the early days of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, Britain preferred to intensify contact with Turkey while indifferently setting aside Japan and Spain. Later, once it was confirmed that Spain's joining the German-Italian axis had become an irreversible fact, the weight on the side of the scales opposing an alliance with the Soviet Union was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>It is true that, because of the difficult birth of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, they took the opportunity to show goodwill to the Japanese government. It is also true that some British people often cited Japan's attitude as one of their excuses against a complete alliance with the Soviet Union. However, the progress and difficulties of this Anglo-Soviet negotiation had little direct relationship with Japan's opposition.</p>
<p>However, even so, if the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance had already been established today, then the current situation in the Far East, with Japan's demands on Britain in Tianjin, would not have occurred. Japan probably misunderstood the weight its Mongolian border demonstration carried in hindering the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. So, perhaps it was thinking: if Britain was afraid of Japan's power and was even hesitant to ally with Soviet Russia, then, due to the same fear, what was to prevent Britain from submitting to Japan's threats regarding its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese war? Thus, it boldly put forward a demand that Britain could never accept: complete cooperation with Japan to create a "New Order in East Asia!"</p>
<p>However, the matter is not so simple. This sudden move by Japan is largely rooted in the current European situation. What exactly is the current situation in Europe? This is beyond the scope of this article, but the overall situation can be summarized in three points: First, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have made no progress, and there is probably little hope in the near future. Second, Germany and Italy are planning to create another crisis in Europe. Third, Germany and Italy are still working to win over Japan.</p>
<p>It is now very clear to everyone that Japan's current coercion of Britain is actually its final bargaining chip on whether or not to join the German-Italian axis. After this failure, it will probably formally join the German-Italian-Western group and establish a military alliance with them. Therefore, in the past two days, the Japanese ambassador to Italy has arrived in Berlin to cooperate with his German counterpart in maintaining close contact with the German authorities. At the same time, from the standpoint of urging the early realization of the German-Italian-Japanese-Spanish military alliance, Hitler naturally approves of Japan making such a provocative attempt to test Chamberlain's current cabinet.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance will appear after the German-Japanese-Italian-Spanish military alliance.</p>
<p>(2) A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity</p>
<p>In the past two days, British newspapers have been filled with accounts of the insults inflicted on Britain by Japanese soldiers and ruffians in Tianjin. Public opinion is at its peak. However, upon closer observation, one can immediately discover that this is not alarming. Britain now has a clear and accurate assessment of Japan's economy, military strength, manpower, and all other aspects. Britain does not currently want to go to war with Japan. However, they believe that Japan's difficult situation makes it even less likely to risk a large-scale conflict with Britain, or even the danger of a large-scale conflict.</p>
<p>I have had many discussions with some British people about this matter in the past two days. Their unanimous conclusion is that the focus of the issue is whether the current British government under Prime Minister Chamberlain is willing to make a firm decision. If so, then even thoroughly sanctioning Japan and ending the Japanese invasion of China in one fell swoop would not be difficult. Moreover, now is the best time.</p>
<p>Their reasons are: (1) Although the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is difficult to achieve, their positions on supporting China are largely consistent. So, at a time when this alliance is difficult to achieve, it may be worthwhile to conduct a concrete experiment in cooperation on the issue of supporting China as the first step towards a future alliance. (2) The American fleet has been redeployed to the Pacific, and yet a full-scale war has not broken out, and Japan is most afraid of the United States. (3) The Soviet Russian Far East Red Army has an absolute advantage over the Japanese forces stationed in Manchuria, and yet Germany and Italy are currently powerless in the West, and Japan is most afraid of Soviet Russia. (4) Japan's war against China has completely fallen into a passive position. Therefore, if Chamberlain's current government truly makes a firm decision to sanction Japan, the situation and the war can be relatively straightforward and predictable. For example: First, contact the Chinese government and guarantee large-scale material assistance from Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States. The Chinese side should immediately launch a full-scale general offensive. Second, correspondingly, the Soviet Union should concentrate a large amount of military force in the Far East, posing a most fatal threat to Japan. Third, the British, American, and French navies in the Far East should concentrate in certain areas and hold demonstrations. Then, fourth, send Japan an ultimatum and convene an international conference such as the Nine-Power Conference to resolve all disputes between China and Japan. In that case, Japan would only have two paths before it: either to submit to pressure and end its war of aggression against China, or to go further and join the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is a greater possibility of taking the latter path," I said.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. Because in that case, even the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Spain would be very problematic and could not be relied upon as a backing for Japan." Moreover, at the very least, "this can promote the formal establishment of a global anti-aggression front."</p>
<p>As for the attitude of China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, it can be said that there is no problem. As long as Britain is firm.</p>
<p>The current situation is so clear, and the British authorities are fully aware of these things. Therefore, in the past two days, according to what we have been able to know and see, Britain has been issuing subtle warnings to Japan, formally, privately, and through public opinion: "Danger!" "Danger!" "Your fatal point is already here!" "If we take action!" ... and so on.</p>
<p>(3) The Current British Government's Considerations</p>
<p>If the Japanese militarists are completely numb to the above situation, that may not be the case. They probably anticipated that the current British government would never make the above move. That is why they dare to be so carefree and casually insulting to Britain. However, we must know that Britain's current basic position in the Far East will absolutely not change due to Japan's disturbances. Moreover, the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is in progress, and the Sino-British relationship is at its closest. The only consideration of the British government now is how to find the most suitable way for itself in these complex international relations to get through Japan's current coercion. On the British side, there are still very many ways to do this. However, if Japan stubbornly sticks to its own opinions and mistakenly believes that Britain's uncertain actions are due to weakness or to force it to cooperate and create a "New Order in East Asia," then, in the end, Britain may be forced to take the thorough approach mentioned above.</p>
<p>I repeat here once again: To think that Britain and Japan can cooperate to create a "New Order in East Asia" is absolutely impossible from any angle under the current situation! Absolutely impossible! (Sent from London on June 16)</p>

<p>[Reuters Danzig, 8th] The local National Socialist Party newspaper stated that a "children's playground" is being built on Mount Bischofsberg, a forbidden area overlooking the entire city of Danzig. A Reuters reporter made a special trip to visit today. As soon as the reporter started up the hillside, he saw many East Prussian military trucks speeding to the top of the mountain, stirring up sand. Guards were stationed along the way, and the top of the mountain was surrounded by barbed wire. Through a hastily constructed fortification, the reporter saw anti-aircraft guns being built. Two guards immediately confiscated the camera carried by the reporter and took him to the guard room. There, a team of workers was building a barracks that was about to be completed under armed guard. More than fifty military trucks, all marked with East Prussia, were parked on the square. The reporter explained to an official that he had come to visit the "children's playground" that was being built. The officer couldn't help but smile and said, "But we are here" (meaning that it is not a real children's playground, but a playground for soldiers). The reporter then asked, "Will soldiers wearing uniforms and equipped with automatic rifles use this playground?" The colonel replied, "This will depend on the future, but I hope not."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] Today marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the war between China and Japan. The British Aid to China Movement Committee held a luncheon at noon. The keynote speech was delivered by the famous writer, Harold Stannard, who expressed his admiration for China's resistance. He stated, in brief, that "Our belief in the common culture of humanity is fortunately maintained by the experiences of the Chinese nation, and that which has been lost is restored. The importance of China's position is such that this is a belief that has not been lost, and that under certain circumstances, it is indispensable for those who understand the East. A great nation such as the Chinese nation, when it encounters oppression, will inevitably have new advantages, that is, human advantages, spontaneously emerge. Looking at countries around the world, none makes us feel more that the future is unlimited than China. The events that have occurred in that country are of a great nature, surpassing those that have occurred in other parts of the world. In a word, China is now moving towards a fulfilling and abundant life, and I am very happy to cooperate with this movement." The Aid to China Movement Committee also sent a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek in China on the same day, expressing their respects in commemoration.</p>
<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3 id="e20">Japanese × Rampant Anti-British Sentiment <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, world newspapers have been filled with news of the Japanese × anti-British movement.</p>
<p>Why is Japan × anti-British? First, they want to intimidate Britain before the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, forcing Britain to abandon its policy of supporting China. Second, they are preparing to monopolize, consolidate, and manage the occupied areas in China.</p>
<p>We must recognize here: (1) Anti-British is the first step towards anti-Western Europe and the United States. (2) Britain and Western Europe and the United States cannot compromise with Japan, whether on moral grounds or in terms of interests. (3) The Western European and American powers can only use force against force and an eye for an eye.</p>
<p>As for us in China, based on the experience of two years of resistance, what × people like is a disaster for our country, and what × people hate is to our country's advantage. Therefore, if Japanese × like to be anti-British, we must oppose anti-British. If Japanese × hate Britain, we must be even more pro-British!</p>
<p>However, Japanese × anti-British sentiment is by no means because Britain supports China. We are pro-British, and we are by no means dependent on Britain. Here, the rumors that are being spread at the behest of Japanese ×, talking about anti-communism and peace, and also advocating that Britain is about to force us to surrender, have no basis whatsoever! Here, the principle of striving for foreign aid while taking self-reliance as the basis must be thoroughly realized!</p>
<h3 id="e21">War Situation on the Southeast Coast <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The battles in the southeastern coastal provinces have suddenly become tense in the past few days. This is the first step in our strategic effort to achieve greater victories.</p>
<p>The Japanese × have recently landed in Shantou, Chaozhou, Yuhuan, Dinghai Mountain, Shishi, and other places. Their purpose is: (1) To cover up the inability of their army to attack on all fronts. (2) To threaten the position of Britain and France in the Far East. (3) To echo Germany and Italy. Therefore, it has no impact on our military.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese × harassment on the coast also contains an attempt to support their political offensive militarily and economically, in order to facilitate their organization into a central government, and to facilitate their use of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of our Southeast.</p>
<p>Therefore, our counter-offensive in the southeastern provinces and the expansion of combat behind enemy lines, such as the recent attacks on Jiangmen and Guangzhou, and cutting off the Beijing-Shanghai railway, are of very great significance. In the future, we must also cooperate with large-scale anti-Wang Jingwei movement to achieve greater victories.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Current Situation and Future of the War of Resistance <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Shan</p>
<p>New Situation and New Crisis</p>
<p>Two years of heroic resistance, the Japanese ×× are not embarrassed in front of our entire Chinese nation! Their "not but yielding" top strategy has failed, their "quick battle quick decision" secondary strategy has failed, and their "quick peace quick conclusion" next strategy has also failed. Finally, when we had been resisting for a year, they tried to conquer us by occupying Wuhan, but in the end we still did not yield, we still did not recognize them, and all their attempts failed. After that, they had to admit: "The Sino-Japanese War has entered a new stage"; they had to admit that "the real beginning of the war is after the occupation of Wuhan"; they had to issue the lament of "preparing to fight a hundred-year war with China"!</p>
<p>The facts have made it clear to the Japanese × that they must adapt to the new stage of the war and decide on new methods to overcome difficulties. However, they are even more aware that to overcome the difficulties they are encountering in China today, they cannot rely on Japan's own population, land, and production. All of these have been almost exhausted in the past war of aggression against China. Therefore, they have adopted a new strategy of aggression against China that combines military, political, and economic means, using China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to solve their difficulties.</p>
<p>This new strategy shows that the main aim of the Japanese ×× is to rely on political power, combined with military action, to rule the occupied areas of China and to invade the unoccupied China, in order to achieve the goal of annexing all of China and monopolizing East Asia. Therefore, they have proposed to establish a "New Order" in East Asia, and they have proposed to establish a cooperative political system between China, Japan, and Manchuria. This all shows that the Japanese × want to completely use political methods, combined with military action, to annex China under the rule of the Japanese ××, in order to monopolize East Asia. The main direction of the Japanese × invasion of China has been placed in the occupied areas, in eastern China, North China, Central China, and South China, the entire area east of the Yellow River, and east of the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou railways. This is also the most populous, most fertile, and most productive area in eastern China. They want to use the rule of this area to absorb China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to attack and conquer our country.</p>
<p>The facts of the eight or nine months since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan have completely proven that the Japanese × are doing their best to promote this new strategy. Under this overall policy, they have adopted "leapfrog tactics" and "using war to support war" militarily. The so-called "leapfrog tactics" is to use their possession of important cities and transportation lines, their possession of modern mechanized troops, and the mobility of their troops to compensate for their insufficient and dispersed forces, to compensate for the disappearance of attack targets, to raid and occupy our weaker points and places, to gradually destroy our counter-offensive forces, and to wipe out guerrillas in the occupied areas, in order to expand the borders of their occupied areas and consolidate the rule of the occupied areas. The so-called "using war to support war" is to use this "leapfrog tactics" to strengthen the occupied areas and ensure their governance, to use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources in the occupied areas to supplement and increase their combat power, and to gradually realize the annexation of all of China. Politically, on the one hand, they are doing their best to consolidate the rule of the occupied areas, using deceptive propaganda and false appeasement to establish and consolidate the puppet regimes and puppet organizations in the occupied areas, and then using Wang Jingwei to actively prepare to organize a unified puppet central government or a puppet federal government, in order to promote the "using war to support war" strategy, and to use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to attack and conquer our country. On the other hand, they are intensifying their efforts to prevent China's political progress, intensifying their efforts to destroy our anti-Japanese national united front based on ××××, and intensifying their efforts to create wavering and pessimistic emotions in us about the protracted war of resistance, in order to achieve internal division, separation, and disputes in our country, and to end the war of resistance against Japan. For this purpose, they are currently using the "peace, anti-communism, anti-Chiang, pro-Soviet" arguments advocated by Wang Jingwei and others, doing everything possible to seduce some national scum, wavering elements, stubborn elements, and unscrupulous elements who still exist in our country, who still want to betray the country for personal gain, and doing everything possible to find a second Wang Jingwei in our country. In addition, they have also launched various offensives in the economic and cultural spheres, such as attacking the legal currency, such as taking foreign exchange, such as blockading the Tianjin concession, forcibly occupying Shantou and Dinghai, coveting Fuzhou and Wenzhou, in order to rob property, monopolize commerce, such as buying newspapers and schools, and intimidating those who uphold justice. They are truly shameless, despicable, and unscrupulous! Finally, in diplomacy, recently, on the one hand, they have expanded the anti-British movement, and on the other hand, they have expanded provocations against the Soviet Union, using the means of enticement and intimidation to force the British government, the weakest link in the anti-aggression front, to compromise with Japan, and attempt to jointly pressure our country to surrender under the beastly feet of the Japanese ×.

<h3 id="e24">The Death of D'Annunzio <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Unable to Live, Even More Difficult to Seek Death</p>
<p>Italy's greatest poet—forgive the impudence, in his own words, he should be "the world's greatest poet"—dramatist, and battlefield hero Gabriele D'Annunzio, finally met with the most heartbreaking thing, which was also what he had painstakingly tried to prevent for twenty years—that is "death," an ordinary "death," an unmoving death. Naturally, he was not afraid of death, but he always wanted an extraordinary "death." But now he passed away peacefully and quietly like an ordinary person, dying in his sleep. What an unpleasant thing for this great and world-renowned figure!</p>
<p>D'Annunzio was a great poet, a flying general, the hero of the Fiume incident, a loyal follower of Fascism, and also a "romantic seed," like a most wonderful drama. His life was full of climaxes, one after another winning endless applause. So he tried hard to make his death an even greater climax, so that after the curtain fell, people would still give a standing ovation, leaving a deep and indelible impression in people's minds. This matter, from any point of view, was very reasonable.</p>
<p>He planned many shocking ways to die. Unfortunately, each one had its difficulties. In the garden of his villa on Lake Garda, there was a huge Italian war cannon. He thought: wouldn't it be delightful and easy to stand in front of the muzzle and be blown into dust with a single shot? However, this required someone to cooperate, but the person firing the cannon would bear the crime of murder, and no one was willing to help him complete this earth-shattering death.</p>
<p>When the Abyssinian crisis occurred, there was a tense atmosphere between Italy and Britain, and he would never let the opportunity pass. He immediately decided on a good idea. He volunteered, requesting the military authorities to allow him to pilot a plane loaded with high explosives to bomb American battleships. He planned that, after selecting a target, he would make a swift dive, crashing into the deck of the battleship, so that the plane, battleship, and poet would all perish together. The method was not bad, and there was a high possibility of hitting the target. Although D'Annunzio was old and had only one eye, his heroic spirit of that year was still there!... Unfortunately, Britain and Italy had a period of empty threats, and everything was resolved peacefully. D'Annunzio's ambition was unfulfilled, and how heartbroken he was!</p>
<p>As a last resort, jumping into a volcano was also not bad, either nearby Mount Vesuvius or Quimbo Li volcano… However, when he learned that thousands of Japanese people were all committing suicide by jumping into volcanoes, he immediately abandoned the original plan. How could a great poet stoop to follow in the footsteps of others?</p>
<p>Similarly, he also gave up a poetic way to die: arranging a small bedroom in the villa, filled with roses of various colors treated with poison, then falling asleep in the flowers, dying in the fragrant, poisonous atmosphere… An uninvited friend told him that a Frenchman had also committed suicide in this way before, so this path was also blocked.</p>
<p>In terms of love, he was a ruthless demon, heartlessly playing with two actresses, Duse and Ida, and then discarding them like worn-out shoes. At one point, he fervently hoped that one of them would hate him so much that she would run over and kill him, so he could die by the beautiful hands of a woman. Unfortunately, neither of the two women seemed to have such courage. Duse was depressed and unhappy, carrying a broken heart until she faded away. Ida, on the other hand, ran to him, asking to remain a spiritual friend. The poet became furious and let out dogs to bite her, but the dogs were not up to the task and instead showed extraordinary affection for Ida.</p>
<p>The most exciting method was cryopreservation. It sounded easy: all he needed was for a pilot to fly him to the source of a large glacier in Greenland. Once there, he would parachute onto the glacier. The last thing he had to do was simply pose in the most beautiful and solemn manner, sit on the ice, and let the low temperature slowly freeze him to death. In this way, his body would be frozen in the ice, becoming part of the glacier.</p>
<p>The movement of glaciers is very slow. A hundred or two hundred years later, the body would flow downstream with the ice, and someone would eventually discover this "snow-covered poet," and newspapers and magazines would be in an uproar again, achieving the goal of attracting attention. To take a step back, even if he were not discovered, the fact that the poet had disappeared would surely be known to every household and everyone would know about it. However, the trouble arose again. Who would be willing to take him to his final destination?</p>
<p>Finally, he discovered a relatively simple method. One day, he was listening languidly to a conversation between two film technicians and heard the phrase:</p>
<p>"Chemical dissolution!"</p>
<p>A great revelation! In the age of scientific prosperity, is there no solution that can dissolve the human body completely, leaving not a single hair, tooth, or bone, without corroding the enamel of the bathtub? A few months later, a friend received a letter from him saying that he had found a potent acidic liquid that could dissolve the human body completely, leaving not a single hair, tooth, or bone, without corroding the enamel of the bathtub. He planned to take one last bath in this acid. In a moment, all that the great poet would leave in the world would be a little sediment at the bottom of the tub. What he asked of this friend was to come into the bathroom a few minutes later, drain the acidic liquid and the dregs at the bottom of the tub, and rinse it clean with water, ensuring that no trace was left behind. And this friend must keep his mouth shut, not revealing his whereabouts, so that this mysterious disappearance would become a great mystery in the world, and D'Annunzio's name would not be quickly forgotten.</p>
<p>At the same time, he wrote to another friend:</p>
<p>"I want to astonish the whole world with my death... I want to turn into a fragrance, mingling between heaven and earth. I will evaporate into countless tiny molecules. I will never rot in an ordinary tomb. Can you imagine 'Gabriele D'Annunzio' being killed in a hearse, sent to be buried by a group of wailing mourners and fools? Believe me, I will die in the most thought-provoking manner."</p>
<p>Indeed, the extraordinary D'Annunzio should have an extraordinary death.</p>
<p>In eleven days, it would be his seventy-fifth birthday. People generally believed that his death might be staged on that day, adding to the interest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the god of death could not wait any longer. The disease of cerebral hemorrhage—alas, this is not new. Cerebral hemorrhage has killed many people at sea, on land, and in the air—quickly took his life, so quickly that he did not even have time to put down the pen he was writing with, and the ink on the paper had not dried. Without any prior notice, it suddenly ruined the planned climax. A good drama turned into a dog's tail, D'Annunzio must have died with his eyes open. If it were possible, I believe he would be very willing to be resurrected and perform a more exciting and moving ending again.</p>
<p>"Hey! Friend, a little air, okay? I'm getting married tomorrow!"</p>

<p>German troops are building a "children's playground" in Danzig (?). Who would have thought that the German army also understands the art of reversing aging.</p>
<p>Everyone who goes to Hong Kong knows that there are swimming pools and sea swimming areas. This bay and that cove. But some people insist on swimming in the open sea, and as a result, they drown. It's really strange. Why don't these people go and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Repulse Bay?</p>
<p>Although the Legislative Council has passed an ordinance to protect tenants, there are still many landlords who are evicting tenants and raising rents. But homeowners who have houses that are about to collapse cannot see it. A message to landlords: quickly repair your houses. If they collapse, you will not only lose rent but also have to pay compensation.</p>

The countries of those dictators, in particular, are just like one-year-old boys, with a rebellious spirit, secret plans, militarism, uniforms, salutes, waving flags and shouting, and even oppressing women, all of which are typical actions of eleven-year-olds.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we talked about General Feng's shaving his beard. Today, I remembered former US President Hoover's growing a beard.</p>
<p>After graduating from Stanford University, Hoover worked as a secretary for a famous engineer for a while. Later, although he was promoted to engineering affairs, his salary was meager and he was frustrated.</p>
<p>One day, an opportunity came. Someone recommended him to a mining company in London to work as an engineer with an annual salary of seventy-five hundred gold dollars. The number made people laugh from the bottom of their hearts. However, there was a condition attached: the person taking office must be over thirty-five years old.</p>
<p>How disappointing! It would have been great if President Hoover had been born ten years earlier. But now, could he just watch the great opportunity slip away? No, President Hoover was not such a useless person.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, he arrived in London to meet with the Xinjiang chief's special envoy. He had two extra drooping mustaches on his face. As soon as the new chief saw him, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"After all, you Americans have the skill to make people look old. Look at you, you don't even look twenty-five years old!"</p>

<h3 id="e29">Sea Adventures 22 <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— By Captain Lauton, translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous Summary</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Chukes Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, took advantage of the German ship going to Mexico to greet the new year. Because England and Germany had declared war, the British warship was coming to rob the ship. The ship frantically escaped, barely escaping from the tiger's mouth and returning to New York. Chukes then asked them to take the St. Mark to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that the guy was a German spy named Raviki. Suddenly, the ship received a distress radio signal…</p>
<p>They stared for a while, and suddenly, something made their blood run cold. They looked at each other, uncertain.</p>
<p>In the darkness, a sound from the burning ship reached their ears. It seemed like a moan of suffering. It came repeatedly, sometimes high and sometimes low, like weeping and complaining. It was not a human voice. The sound seemed to contain the groans of a resentful ghost.</p>
<p>"Oh! This is a little scary!" Bill exclaimed, "What the heck is going on?"</p>
<p>Fourteen, Jump into the Sea</p>
<p>The boat was lowered into the water, and the strange sound continued. This mysterious atmosphere made the rough sailors tremble with fear. Several churchgoers piously made the sign of the cross on their chests.</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's really ghosts crying and wolves howling!" One muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Jack and Bill sat in the first boat, next to Mr. Wood. The boat was being lowered, and on the top, on the ship's railing, were a row of heads. They were all passengers watching the excitement. After falling to the surface of the water, a wave hit. Mr. Wood shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"We need to row away quickly, otherwise, we'll be crushed!"</p>
<p>At this time, the big ship was also undulating. The small boat really looked like it was going to hit her steel hull and be smashed to pieces. The small boat swayed forward against the waves. Giant waves came over them and dragged them back.</p>
<p>"The weather tonight is really not helping," Mr. Wood muttered to himself. The small boat then entered a layer of bottomless darkness. From the burning ship, there was another bloody red light, rushing up, covering the stern of the ship, revealing that it was a large, decaying steamer.</p>
<p>"Are there any passengers on board, do you think?" Jack asked, a little chilly, because the mournful sound was still coming out.</p>
<p>"It looks to me like it's a weird thing. I can't see its head, and it doesn't have an upper deck," Wood said.</p>
<p>"I didn't see anyone on it," Bill said, after looking carefully for a while. The small boat crossed another big wave.</p>
<p>"We just hope they all get away," Wood said. "But this weird scream is really disturbing! It's not human, so what the hell is it?"</p>
<p>"It's scaring me to death," Bill said, trembling.</p>
<p>As they got closer, the strange sound got louder and more miserable. The heat of the fire and the falling embers made them very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Shanghai News, It is heard that since the devaluation of the legal currency and the failure to accept it directly, resulting in six and a half pence, some old imported goods in Shanghai, the import trade, is in a large form. Importers are telegraphing foreign countries. Recently, banks have been withdrawing money to sell the imported goods that have been contracted for, and the system is restricted. Those who purchase foreign goods are in decline, and some merchants are resisting the foreign merchants in Shanghai, who have always refused.</p>

<p>The receiver is only one of the banks, for business reasons, is willing to pay the price of payment, but the price of the goods is slightly higher, because each exchange draft can still be spotted in the market to exchange for legal currency, so the value of foreign goods has not increased significantly due to foreign exchange, but has also been spotted, and the native goods of China have also risen accordingly, resulting in today's Shanghai living standards, but in terms of the government, its goal of restricting the import of foreign goods can be said to have been achieved, especially the resistance to Japanese goods is more effective, because merchants have always paid in exchange drafts.</p>

<p>(5) Organizational Overview</p>
<p>The tea department is divided into three sections, responsible for guidance, finance, and warehouse transportation matters. There are nearly 120 staff members, about 50 stationed in factories for management guidance, about 30 in warehouse transportation stations, and about 20 in districts in charge of loan matters. The headquarters and various offices have relatively few people. Most of the technical personnel are transferred from various agencies in Zhejiang Province. For personnel with common work of five or six or more, the examination and recruitment method is used. For example, staff such as factory management are assigned after a certain period of training.

<h3 id="e32">A Few Opinions on Popular Vernacular Literature and Art <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>The popularization and massification of literature and art is a new direction and a new starting point for the development of Chinese literature and art. The adoption of this new direction and the setting of this new starting point is a self-awakening of literary and art workers, and at the same time, it is limited by the historical lessons of the development of Chinese literature. The War of Resistance is a driving force. Due to the change of political conditions, the urgency of the need is declared, and the awakening of literary and art workers is urged, a new stage of literary and artistic development is born.</p>
<p>From the above understanding, we can clearly see two points: First, the current vernacular literature and art movement is a new literary and art revolution; the specific content of this new literary and art revolution is the popularization and massification of literature and art; second, this movement is a product of the War of Resistance, and it has developed in response to the importance of the War of Resistance; and in wartime, it marks the beginning of a new stage of literary and artistic development, so it is not an emergency movement.</p>
<p>In this movement, those authors who still regard literature and art as something to be enjoyed by a few people will be ruthlessly abandoned by history. On the other hand, authors who create popular literature and art—mass literature and art—must understand the development significance of the current movement and produce works with the utmost caution. Theorists and critics must also point out the direction of creation and the shortcomings that should be avoided from the understanding of the movement and from the criticism of the works.</p>
<p>Authors of popular literature and art must first know that what they want is literature and art, not works other than literature and art. This goes without saying, but now some authors of popular literature and art have forgotten or ignored this point and written some odd things. Seven years ago, Qu Qiubai said: "If only a few abstract theories are written in a spoken style, it can be regarded as a literary work, then there is no need for a literary movement at all, because this is only a popular thesis. Literary works should go through concrete images... using descriptive methods, not deductive methods." Some authors have now forgotten the special properties of literature and art, or rigidly and mistakenly understand the educational nature of the works. Although the works "borrow" the format and tone of old literature and art, they are a lot of nouns and terms, with absolutely no description to express. This is undoubtedly going to fail.</p>
<p>What's worse is the use of local slang and vulgar words, putting very crude language in the works. Some authors think this is popular, this is colloquial. They don't know that this is not popular but vulgar; it is not colloquial, but a degradation of the art of language. The language of popular literature and art must be the folk language that has been selected and refined.</p>
<p>Secondly, using old forms to create popular literature and art means using the essence of the old forms, not accepting the dross and poison of the old forms. In order to adapt to the level and requirements of the broad masses, and at the same time, in order to improve the artistic taste of the broad masses, we want to create new forms. Using the old forms in this way has a future. We are using the old forms, and at the same time, we are destroying the old forms and creating new forms! We very much agree with Pu Feng's statement: "If you mechanically judge 'new' and 'old', then the new will never be separated from the 'old', and new forms can never be established. Conversely, if our things pass through the current era's view of life and our works have the reflection of real life, and are extremely close to the masses in form, but are definitely not like Five Watch Tunes, Wuxi Scenery, etc., which have a certain form, then it can be said that the new form has already been established."</p>
<p>Some authors now seem not to understand this point. When using old forms, they are trapped too painfully by the old forms, thus leading to two problems: First, "form goes to content" because the format is that way, you have to fill enough numbers. Second, form hinders content. The so-called form has a backlash effect on the content. As a result, the work is either lifeless or "disabled", not "pregnant with falseness" or "bound feet".</p>
<p>Again, for popular literature and art, some authors have another misunderstanding, thinking that popular literature and art is a crude and simple thing, so a single-story story is considered "goods". Yes, that is "goods". It is popular literature and art, a work that the masses can accept. However, it only stops at the masses being able to accept it, but it is not welcomed and loved by the masses. Since it is not welcomed and loved by the masses, then you have to admit failure.</p>
<p>We cannot see the masses as too incompetent and ignorant, without the ability to appreciate artistic works. On the contrary, we should all know that many old works are very rich in content and very complex in plot, and these works are loved by the masses. The masses love it for being fascinating and tasty. If our work cannot be fascinating and tasty, then we also have to admit failure. Popular literature and art is not easy to write. Constant effort is the only way to break through the difficulties; as Qu Qiubai said when discussing "mass literature and art": "After the actual" work begins, experience will tell us many new methods.

<h3 id="e33">A Critique of Pearl Buck's "The Patriot" <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>The American female author, Pearl Buck, who won the 1938 Nobel Prize for Literature, has published her novel "The Patriot," which depicts China, this year. It is said that this book has not yet been completed, but it has already been selected as the best novel of March this year by the American Book Club. In our country's publishing industry, which loves the poor and weak, at least three translations have been produced simultaneously. The sensational nature of this novel can be imagined. However, our spiritual and mysterious country is not easily seen clearly even by ourselves. Especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, social reality has shown great turbulence, making it even more difficult for people to discern. Yet, we don't know what blessing we have received, but there is a famous artisan of the twentieth century to portray this image for us. Undoubtedly, we need to be grateful; however, the amount of gratitude needs to be carefully examined.</p>
<p>Wu Yifan, the son of a capitalist, may be a rebel from his class, a revolutionary fighter, which is very possible in semi-colonial China. However, behind this title, there are various inevitable and accidental factors. Only through his own internal struggle can he shed his rich clothes and enter the ranks of the city. In typical creations, this is the deciding factor for success or failure. Those who can completely depict it are successful, and those who do not mention it are unsuccessful. How does Pearl Buck grasp the character of Wu Yifan?</p>
<p>Without exception, she attributes his radical change to his own willfulness and unrestrainedness. "That was in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, and his family never dreamed that Yifan would become a revolutionary," she lightly mentions, assigning him the role of a revolutionary. Then, this character is merely conceptualized and not flesh and blood.</p>
<p>An excellent but weak youth cannot withstand the work of battle, yet he worked, training and organizing workers in Shanghai to prepare for the arrival of the revolutionary storm. He worked hard, educating people, and should have been educated himself, and he should have become steadfast. However, at the height of his vigor, he failed, he despaired, he forgot everything about his motherland, and he began to live in Japan, becoming a hedonist. He fell in love, and he only knew how to love his Zhu, passing ten years in a daze. He no longer had the passion for revolution and had transitioned from a visionary to someone who "relied on reality for survival." He settled down in the ebb of the revolution. This has its shadows in reality. However, we cannot see the bridge in between this kind of transformation, making it impossible to see a "typical character," and thus it is merely conceptualized, without flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Enlan is the second protagonist of "The Patriot." Undoubtedly, the author regards him as a typical fighter of the emerging class. Such a portrayal is insufficient, and it is better to say that the image of the fighter is distorted by the reverse reflection of a concave-convex lens. Enlan, this passionate, violent, and absurd character that we see, she (the author) cannot understand the perseverance and heroism of these mass fighters and leaders. She does not understand how they are connected to the masses and how they fight for him!</p>
<p>Mudan is obviously a secondary figure in the book, but she reveals that the author has no clear understanding of the new Chinese woman. She has not been able to see that the two generations, old and new, are completely different. She still believes that the new female fighters are still just like the old days, solving problems for their husbands, sewing for their husbands, and giving birth to children. She does not know that the new Chinese women are independently and heroically participating in the struggle of the masses!</p>
<p>The error of "typical character" is due to the error of grasping the "typical environment." The author has not been able to grasp the nature of Chinese society, and lacks understanding and sympathy for the Chinese revolution. She believes that China is already a capitalist society "ruled by bankers," obliterating the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of China. In this way, she has no way to grasp the twists and turns of the Chinese revolution. Everything in old China, I am afraid, is too tightly grasped in the author's memory. Therefore, she regards the emerging group as the "borrowed corpse returning the soul" of the nursing home. Her knowledge of the Chinese revolution is only superficial and shallow. How can she grasp the men and women in the revolutionary wave correctly?</p>
<p>Speaking of the War of Resistance, the opportunity and impetus for the birth of this pseudo-new China, the author's knowledge is too weak. She distorted the "Xi'an Incident" - strangely, why doesn't she read Snow's "Red Star Over China." She does not understand the reality of the construction of the Chinese united front, and she still believes that the Chinese army needs to be bought with money. She disregards the glorious fact that China treats prisoners of war with preferential treatment and imagines a story of the masses abusing prisoners of war and even getting Enlan's acquiescence. This is a defamation and an obligation to do malicious propaganda for Japan! These stains cannot be washed away!</p>
<p>She remembers the filth, opium, superstition, and poverty of China; the disorder of social order. She wrote a clear contrast, that is, Japan's order, cleanliness, love of beauty, and no beggars (?) ... She expresses the "patriotism" of the Japanese - regarding this, her praise is more than the needles. She does not understand the structure of Japanese society and also praises Japanese women. In her mind, the families of Yifan and Zhu are the most ideal families. What about her political thoughts? She wrote:</p>
<p>"He (Yifan) often thought about these things, who could rule the country after the war, how to revise the laws, what kind of laws should be used, he now knows that Enlan is not enough to be a ruler, enlightenment, learning, order, and elegance are needed in life, but Enlan doesn't know. Yifan feels that Zhu has changed his thinking, she taught him to love order, good nature and attitude, she has been separated from him for ten years, his ten years of living in Japan are enough to make him know everything, he has seen the people of Japan are more loyal to this kind of thing, their lives are more orderly, he dares not tell Enlan the strengths of the Japanese people, because Enlan may think that he praises the strengths of the Japanese and does not trust his loyalty. ... His thoughts are enough to show that he has grown up ... "</p>
<p>This passage is exactly the author's speech, expressing her doubts and vagueness about the future of China. Undoubtedly, everything in China, the Chinese revolution, and the great Chinese War of Resistance, are very vague to her.</p>
<p>In the Chinese War of Resistance, people are eager for understanding of Chinese society and the Chinese War of Resistance. The appearance of Pearl Buck's "The Patriot" is naturally a sensation. However, she cannot show us the posture of the new China emerging from the old China, but mixes the new and the old, the good and the bad, into a "chop suey" that obscures China's way out and future. This cannot improve the understanding of China by Europeans and Americans, but instead increases their misunderstanding of China. Moreover, the author intentionally uses our leader Chairman Chiang as an interlude character, which is nothing more than a technique to confuse readers and cater to the readers. Her cleverness, her attempt to distort reality, makes her works fragmented, false, and ridiculous. Naturally, her trivial descriptions and artistic techniques do give the work a brocade coat. However, she can cleverly reveal the courage of the Japanese army in the revolution, which can prove that she is also very loyal to reality; however, she does not understand China and does not understand China's War of Resistance. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Popularity and Vulgarity <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Han Bo</p>
<p>It is especially difficult to write "popular literature" that is far from "popularity" without becoming "vulgar."</p>
<p>Vulgar articles are not necessarily popular works, but once a work wants to make it popular, it is inevitable to be close to the danger of "vulgarity."</p>
<p>To explain this principle clearly, it seems necessary to analyze the characteristics of "popular literature." In the field of literature and art, the popular category is the closest to the masses and the most capable of playing a role in the masses. However, to achieve this level, it is very necessary to cater to the tastes of the masses, and to write folk stories in folk languages. This is the most prominent feature of "popular literature," and it is also the key to "popularity" easily turning into "vulgarity." In order to make the article popular, it is right to devote oneself to studying the tastes and interests of the masses, cater to them, and adapt to them. Only through this popular form can literature and art penetrate the masses and win over the masses; however, if one accidentally reverses the order of importance and blindly changes the content of one's article according to the needs of customs, then popular literature will lose its original purpose of improving the culture and level of the masses and changing the ideas of the masses, and fall into the realm of "vulgarity."</p>
<p>This transformation is really a subtle mystery, a terrible evil situation, and every popular art worker should not ignore it.</p>
<p>We can very well imagine how tasteless it is for a propaganda team to go to the people and only win a big laugh from the people with absurd and ridiculous lies. The ending of "popular literature" once it becomes "vulgar articles" is not much better than this. Now some people advocate using the materials of "love change" or that kind of material as the framework to start the work of popular literature. I am afraid that it will become vulgar articles unconsciously. In fact, the "popularity" of articles does not only lie in the low level of interest and the mediocrity of the topics. It is only necessary to tell the truth of the masses, be easy to understand, and the story is simple and tense. Are they not all excellent popular literature? The masses like to watch "Widow Ma Opening a Shop" and "Pan Jinlian," but they are also happy to accept "The Biography of Hong Yang Heroes" and the War of Resistance. The reason is not necessarily to cater to low-level tastes, but mostly because what the latter writes are things that the masses deeply understand and want to do, and naturally it is easy to make them better. Therefore, "popularity does not necessarily mean blindly" catering to base needs and does not necessarily use old forms unconditionally. We must play a leading role among the masses everywhere and improve the cultural level of the masses through the form of "popularity." For the improvement of mass literary authors, the tastes and interests of the masses will gradually need to be changed in the transitional era, and she will never only try to obtain readers from the masses and fall into the shameful state of "vulgarity," and then lose the original intention of popularity.</p>
<p>"Vulgar articles" can only paralyze the readers of the masses, and we must be doubly vigilant and pay attention to preventing "popularity" from being considered "vulgarity"!</p>
<h3 id="e35">A Letter of Condolence from a World Language Speaker <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Jue Liang</p>
<p>Dear, heroic anti-Japanese soldiers:</p>
<p>As a reader of the world language, I extend my deep respect to you from the distant rear!</p>
<p>We, the Chinese Esperantists, stand at the forefront of international propaganda, and have successively founded Esperanto publications such as "The Messenger of the Far East," "Voice of the Orient," "New Stage," and "Justice." In them, we have introduced the heroic epic written by you in blood and flesh to "go abroad" and present it to the world's lovers of peace, equality and justice.</p>
<p>We all know that the work of propaganda is not only to report on the heroic resistance of soldiers and expose the evil deeds of the enemy, but also to actively engage in close contact with the progressive world organizations or national bodies of various countries. Therefore, various Esperanto publications have received multiple layers of letters of condolence from Esperanto speakers and national bodies from various countries, expressing great sympathy and encouragement to you - the heroic soldiers.</p>
<p>Now, let's show you a few postcards from the hundreds of condolence letters sent to "The Messenger of the Far East" by Esperanto speakers from various countries to be forwarded to you:</p>
<p>To the brave anti-Japanese Chinese soldiers:</p>
<p>In my school and family, as well as the vast majority of my friends, I firmly support your determination to resist and your heroic fight. In particular, my countrymen also feel that brave Chinese soldiers, our comrades, are protecting and resisting, and are tactical masters against fascism. At the same time, for us, this is a great, a true victory? We all believe deeply that victory is in the hands of the brave Chinese soldiers at the front! We salute you! Your friend</p>

<h3 id="e37">Air Defense Equipment Commissioner Talks About the Completion of the Air Defense Force Preparation. Can Be Mobilized Immediately When Emergency Order is Issued. The Hong Kong Government Decides to Abandon Large-Scale Air Defense Construction. Residents' Participation in Training is Not Enthusiastic, Which is a Shortcoming. <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Under the efforts of the authorities, the air defense deployment in Hong Kong has been largely completed. Various air defense forces have been established, such as fire brigades, excavation teams, and ambulance teams. Once a mobilization order is issued, they can return to their teams and concentrate their efforts.</p>
<p>Participation in Air Defense is Not Enthusiastic</p>
<p>What is currently used as a basis is that residents' participation in air defense services is not enthusiastic. Therefore, there is a great shortage of air defense rescuers, which is far from the original quota of 9,000 people. And those who sign up for fire reserve training are also not active. The strength of the fire brigade itself has been strengthened. Recently, a batch of fire trucks purchased from the UK have arrived. In the past week, there have been criticisms outside that the Hong Kong government is not nervous enough about air defense equipment. However, the conclusions drawn from Spain and recent wars believe that the cost of attacking cities with scattered populations and wide areas with willpower bombs is huge and is not allowed by economic principles. However, this kind of criticism only knows one thing and does not know the other. Air raids are not only poison gas bombs. If bombing and incendiary bombs are thrown into densely populated commercial areas, the loss of life will be great, and our losses will be huge.</p>
<p>Preparing to Defend Against Poison Gas Attacks</p>
<p>However, poison gas attacks are also one of the ways of air raids. We cannot lack this in planning the overall air defense equipment, so as not to leave a flaw in a hundred plans. At the same time, we can show the Japanese that we are prepared, so that they have something to fear. Incendiary bombs are an important air raid weapon with a wide range of destruction. However, if they can be extinguished quickly, it may not be difficult to deal with them. This depends on whether the deployment of air defense personnel is appropriate. If an incendiary bomb is found, all air defense personnel can quickly use the stored sand and long-handled shovel to extinguish it, so that it will not cause a prairie fire. For the sake of practice, a batch of incendiary bombs has been specially ordered from the UK, and will be transported to Hong Kong by the Blue Funnel Line soon. If the fire has already formed, the air defense personnel should quickly notify the excavation team and the fire brigade to come to the scene to extinguish and intercept the fire. As for the ambulance team and the disinfection team, they are also trained to be enthusiastic. They can gather and prepare to depart for the disaster area within a few minutes after the air raid alarm is issued.</p>
<p>Reserving Sandbags for Distribution and Application</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Air Defense Office held a poison gas test. Under the protection of gas masks, the disinfection team was able to rush to the disaster site within a few minutes. The price of each gas mask is HK$2.5. The Hong Kong government has now reserved a batch, which will then be sold during emergencies. If the poor people of the three people in Hong Kong misuse the purchase of the mask, it is really difficult to do. This is the truth. If we can give such advice and instructions to build economic air-raid shelters, then the government really cannot do anything about other issues at this time. Whether it can be realized in the future is not certain. As for the recommendations for large-scale air-raid shelters and secret passages, the Hong Kong government has decided to abandon them. The government is now beginning to reserve sandbags, which will be distributed to residents for use when necessary, and will instruct them to arrange them. If they are not directly hit by bombs, fragments and stray bullets can be defended. In the current situation in Hong Kong, this is the most effective and most effective method. The fire control has been prepared, but it is not scheduled, because it is waiting for the Hong Kong government to approve it.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Special Issue of Movie News "The Great Bombing of Chongqing" to be Released <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The 49th issue of "The Great Bombing of Chongqing," produced by the Chongqing China Film Studio and supervised by the Political Department of the Military Commission, has been shipped by air yesterday. The film has been edited in a very systematic way from more than 4,000 feet, using a total of 2,000 feet, making it a very valuable documentary film. The content first introduces the prosperous state of Chongqing before being bombed, and how it was quickly built into a modern city after the War of Resistance to take on the central role of commanding the front-line military. Japanese planes have been bombing in large numbers since May 3rd. In addition to recording the real scene of the bombing at that time, the film also systematically records the bombing of foreign industries. Moreover, French Bishop Shang Weishan inspected the church after the bombing and saw only the broken head of the statue lying in the rubble. Shang immediately gave a short speech in French for the movie news, denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese people. He said at the end, "There is always justice and public reason in the world. Anyone who can stop me from saying this is a supreme sin." The whole film has very clear explanations, explaining everything. In addition to being shown at the same time as the Cantonese film "Defending the Siyi," a special feature of the Chinese film anti-Japanese war, the film will also be shown with a Western film in a Western film theater in Hong Kong to make foreigners understand the situation at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e43">The Overseas Chinese Middle School Held a Graduation Ceremony Yesterday. Held at the Entertainment Theater with Entertainment to Help. <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Middle School is a well-known middle school in this area. At 9:00 am yesterday, it held its graduation ceremony for this year at the Entertainment Theater. More than a thousand people, including students' parents, guests, and teachers and students of the school, were present, making it a grand occasion. After the ceremony, Principal Wang Shu delivered a speech, encouraging students to "practice benevolence" and "achieve benevolence." Then, Gao Ting was invited to issue graduation certificates and give a speech, elaborating on lying in wait, ten years of survival, and ten years of lessons, and said that anti-Japanese education should pay attention to personality training, and education should assist national defense facilities. Bao Hanshen, the representative of the male middle school students, gave a speech with precise meaning, saying that he hoped that the graduates would return to the motherland, where there is not pleasure, and not waste their energy and material resources here. He also encouraged the students who could not go to school to recognize that society is a school and to have the belief of learning until they are old, without having to be discouraged and working hard. Yang Wenzhu, the representative of the female middle school students, spoke fluent Mandarin, hoping that the graduates would go inland. Both the front and the rear need young people, which was very touching. After the graduate representative Lin delivered a reply, they sang the school song and performed entertainment. The entertainment programs included chorus songs by the school's choir and singing performances by kindergarten students, which were innocent and lively and won warm applause from the audience.</p>
<p>The drama was performed by the school principal's association, "Teacher Yu," and a movie was shown. It did not end until 1:00 pm. The number of graduates of the school this year is: 29 male high school students, 19 female high school students, 20 female junior high school students, 31 elementary school students, and 5 kindergarten students.</p>

<p>——Kwang Hua Middle School——</p>
<p>Coming from Queen's Road and running up D'Aguilar Street, the "Stone Slab Street," one immediately sees the characters for "Kwang Hua Middle School." It stands firmly in a corner of Hollywood Road. Kwang Hua Middle School, which was founded just eight years ago with only one building, has now expanded to three or four buildings. This semester, due to insufficient space, they are continuing to urgently search for school buildings. Its development has been quite rapid.</p>
<p>Currently, the school has over 700 junior high and upper elementary school students and 40 to 50 faculty members. The school prepares students for further education in Hong Kong and mainland China. The school's library has approximately 3,000 volumes, and the physics and chemistry equipment and specimens are quite abundant. The sports equipment is also considered complete, and the school uses the YMCA and Blake Garden for sports activities. The school also has a Boy Scout troop, and all members undergo rigorous training. The troop members often volunteer at various charity performances and sports meets, which has earned them high praise from the community.</p>
<p>The school fees are as follows: Junior high grades 1-3, $40 per year; upper elementary grades 1-2, $33; lower elementary grades 3-4, $27; lower elementary grades 1-2, $22.</p>
<h3 id="e49">First Aid Kit <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>The most important things to supply our heroic soldiers fighting bravely in the front lines amidst the rain of bullets are bullets, food, and medicine. Sometimes, when bullets and food run out, they can still fight hand-to-hand, but if they are injured and have no medicine, they are immobilized. Therefore, medicine occupies an absolutely important position in wartime. Whether in the past or present, what we hear from the staff working in the front lines is how scarce medical supplies are. Clearly, in the more than twenty months of the war of resistance, the front-line medical supply has not been able to adapt actively to the war effort.</p>
<p>We really cannot allow a soldier injured on the front line to suffer pain endlessly, or for a minor injury to become a major wound, even costing him his precious life. Because a recovered soldier has valuable and heroic experience that will make him several times more effective in combat than a new recruit. This is a fact, an ironclad fact.</p>
<p>To help address the inadequacy of front-line medical care, the "first aid kit" came into being. The contents of this "kit" are very light, small, and simple, including bandages, sterilized gauze, cotton, pain relievers, etc. They are composed of inexpensive materials. When a person is injured, they pull open the long string at one end of the first aid kit, and a pain reliever pops out. They swallow it to alleviate the pain, then apply the sterilized red medicine to the wound first, and then use the bandage to cover the wound. In this way, the wounded soldier not only reduces the pain, but also prevents the wound from becoming infected, so that when he is carried back to the rear for treatment, the condition will not have worsened significantly. This first aid kit is truly a practical solution for front-line soldiers in urgent need.</p>
<p>Now, almost every soldier on the front lines is equipped with one of these "talismans." With our battle lines so extensive and our soldiers so numerous, the need for these first aid kits is self-evident. Therefore, various salvation groups in Hong Kong have paid great attention to this matter, constantly producing them on a large scale and shipping them to the front lines. Now, the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association has launched a campaign to donate 500,000 first aid kits. It is gratifying that overseas Chinese compatriots deeply recognize the importance of this matter and continue to respond with donations.</p>
<p>Because of its important position, the selection of medicines and gauze should be taken very seriously, especially the pain relievers, because they are the soul of the entire first aid kit. We should not neglect this. In the past, the central government and the Red Cross had specified standard manufacturing procedures for these first aid kits. However, because the raw material for this pain reliever is a restricted irritant that cannot be purchased without special permission from the authorities, many manufacturers have used an easier-to-buy substitute. This easily available pain reliever is often the best medicine for headaches or other localized pain. Its primary effect is to induce sweating, which is terrible for soldiers' wounds. Therefore, its pain-relieving function may seem similar, but in fact, the effect is often the opposite. A pain reliever like this is not only unimportant for wounded soldiers, but also harmful. Therefore, those who are preparing them must be careful.</p>
<p>The central government attaches great importance to this matter. For this reason, they have repeatedly consulted with the central government and local manufacturers, and as a result, hundreds of thousands of first aid kits have been produced according to specifications.</p>
<p>A reporter took the opportunity to ask Mr. Xu, the person in charge of Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals, about the need for first aid kits and the manufacturing process. He analyzed it in detail, especially pointing out the problem of pain reliever selection. Because of various relationships, they have an easier time obtaining raw materials. At the very least, they will not use pain relievers that induce sweating. Secondly, they also have their own sterilization equipment, so all manufacturing procedures are very proper. This is a major reason why the central government has publicly recommended Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Now, overseas Chinese groups in various parts of Southeast Asia are donating first aid kits, and most of them are ordering them from Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals. The Hong Kong Comfort Association, the Chinese Women's Association, and other salvation groups are mostly also ordering them from Xin Ya. If your organization is interested in donating, you can contact Xin Ya Pharmaceuticals, and they will manufacture them for you, and help you participate in this patriotic movement—donating first aid kits. The soldiers on the front lines who receive this support, I believe, will certainly be able to respond with even greater and more glorious victories.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Addresses the Japanese People Continuation from Yesterday's Third Edition <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Then some people will ask: War is resolved by force, and the Three Principles of the People cannot be used as force. I can answer this question: war is determined by the sum of national power, and the greatest and ultimate force is the national spirit. I can say that the setbacks we suffered in the first phase of the war of resistance were mainly because our spiritual preparation and training in the past were insufficient, and rarely because our armament was insufficient. We have become stronger as we fight on, and of course there are various factors, but the biggest reason is that the experience and lessons of the two years of resistance have further strengthened our spiritual strength. Japanese people, if you want to judge the future of the war, you may as well compare the two sides: what do your warlords have besides force? What clear and proper reasons do you have in your thoughts for this war of aggression that are sufficient to make Japanese soldiers prove the price of their sacrifice? In reality, every one of our officers and soldiers knows that sacrifice is for the country, for the people, and for the principles; at least they know that sacrificing themselves will prevent the nation from being slaves and the country from being destroyed? In particular, they know that there will be countless successors who will continue to take responsibility to achieve final victory, so this sacrifice is glorious and justified. What about you? You claim to love your country, but the result is to harm your country. Now that you have been invading for two years, the more you invade, the more difficult it becomes. Not only is the future uncertain, but failure is imminent. You ask yourselves in the dead of night, China's self-defense is a necessity, but what is Japan's invasion a necessity? From the perspective of the world situation, even if the policy of subjugating China is temporarily successful, there will be even greater wars later on. The Chinese people will never yield and will eventually emerge to restore their country. Moreover, now that you have tasted the strength of China's resistance, there is absolutely no possibility of conquering China? I can say that Chinese soldiers are indeed sacrificing for their country, but Japanese soldiers can only be said to be sacrificing for the warlords, and the result is harming their country. You must know that the meaning of sacrifice is to sacrifice personal interests in exchange for higher interests of the country and the people. Chinese soldiers are like this, but Japanese soldiers are not, because the more Japan invades China, the more dangerous it becomes for itself. Therefore, Japanese soldiers' fighting is not only a futile death, but also harms their country after their own death. Truly patriotic Japanese people, think calmly, and you cannot but admit that my criticism is proper.</p>
<p>Japanese people, you must know that a nation should only fight for self-defense in principle, and should not fight for aggression. If the object of aggression is a nation without culture, without politics, and on the verge of extinction, it may be temporarily successful. But if you wantonly invade an independent country with culture and history, there is no way to avoid failure. Moreover, as far as the Sino-Japanese issue is concerned, although China is weak, it is a major cultural power, and it is also an emerging country in the midst of revolution? Moreover, the principles of the Chinese revolution will never infringe on Japan, and will even benefit Japan? So how can you wantonly eliminate China's independence and wage this war of aggression! I can declare that China has been invaded since it opened its doors to the world, and China is absolutely defending itself. Moreover, in addition to this, China has a firm belief in the Three Principles of the People, while Japan does not. Of course, Japan also has various so-called principles and many new slogans and new terms, but the essence of Japan's principles is aggression; at best, it cannot transcend the selfishness of the nation. And many new slogans and new terms recently have emerged with the progress of aggression. Their meaning is nothing more than to eliminate China's independence, make Japan the conqueror, and make China and other East Asian nations obey Japan. Therefore, these are all deceptive words to decorate the war of aggression and are not principles at all. From this point of view, China not only has principles, but also good principles. Because the war of resistance of China under the Three Principles of the People is to achieve saving oneself and saving others, benefiting oneself and benefiting others. What we are striving for with all our strength is China's freedom and equality, but we also respect Japan's freedom and equality. This is in stark contrast to the foolish policy of Japanese aggressors, who aim to harm others to benefit themselves, and will ultimately harm themselves as a result of harming others. Compared with this, the moral positions of the two sides are vastly different. I dare say that the final victory or defeat of a war depends on the moral standing of each side. We have the absolutely just and absolutely moral reasons for resisting aggression and the belief in the Three Principles of the People, while Japan does not. Therefore, in this war, we have already occupied an absolutely victorious position in spirit. This can be further explained: our Chinese military philosophy is consistent with the traditional Eastern moral creed. China emphasizes the Dao first and the law as the foundation in military affairs; and it also values righteousness over profit and wisdom over strength. These four key principles are actually the most important theorems in our Eastern ancient and modern war history for judging victory. Now your warlords' war of aggression against China is disregarding the Dao and violating the law, being greedy for profit and forgetting righteousness, blindly believing in violence, and obliterating reason, completely violating the principles of morality and military affairs. By comparison, you can know that we Chinese have the confidence to win.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, some Japanese people may disagree, because Japanese rulers often say that Japan's war is to liberate China and liberate Asia. Is this a moral basis? I can answer that you are even more deceived. The lies about the "New Order in East Asia" have already been discussed earlier, and I will refute two more points here:</p>
<p>First, China has only been subjected to Japan's aggression and has not been subjected to aggression by other countries. How can you say that invading China is liberating China? The doctrine of liberation is equal to freedom. Japanese aggressors are doing their best to destroy the political and economic freedom of the Chinese nation. Yet they say they are liberating China. Turning right and wrong upside down is most lamentable.</p>
<p>Second, your warlords say that China is oppressed by Europe and the United States and is a semi-colony of Europe and the United States. This is completely a deliberate attempt to use the situation in the former Qing Dynasty to slander modern China. In recent years, only peaceful policies of European and American countries towards China have been seen. Since our National Government came to power, the relations of various countries with China have generally improved, with mutual respect for treaties and adherence to good faith. And in general, they have expressed sympathy for China's peaceful construction, and our sovereignty is not subject to any oppression from Europe and the United States. Everyone respects us as an independent country. Therefore, the slogan of your warlords that China is a semi-colony is completely a deceptive propaganda to infringe on the commercial interests of various countries in China and to incite ignorant Japanese people to facilitate their attack on China, completely disregarding the facts. Speaking of the treaty relations between China and various countries since the last century, they have already been greatly improved in recent years. Since our National Government came to power, it has decided to seek gradual solutions to all problems through peaceful and faithful diplomacy. And because the related countries are all peaceful and faithful, if Japan had not invaded China and attacked China since the September 18th Incident, it is believed that China's revision of treaties would have been successful long ago. Recently, Japanese warlords have been oppressing concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. These concession issues can only be discussed by the Chinese government with the related countries. Japan's attack on the concessions is trampling on the rights of the related countries and at the same time despising China's national sovereignty. And its purpose is to occupy the concessions, so as to trample on Chinese residents and plunder Chinese interests. Therefore, it is completely an illegal act of aggression against China and aggression against various countries, which will intensify the enslavement of China. How can you spread rumors that it is liberating China?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the policy of your Japanese warlords is to conquer China, and the goal of our national army and people's struggle is to seek liberation from Japanese aggression. No matter how your warlords turn black and white upside down in their propaganda, they cannot deceive the Chinese people and the people of the world. Only some Japanese people may not know the facts. Speaking of liberating Asia, it is even more ridiculous; China is the largest independent country in Asia, and you want to conquer it for no reason. How can you still say you are liberating Asia? If you are so destructive to Greater China, how can the intentions towards other small and weak countries still be worth discussing? Simply put, liberating Asia is conquering Asia. Its purpose is to liberate all Asian nations into the same state as the puppet state of Manchukuo and Korea, where the conquerors are the masters and the conquered are the slaves. I can say that this attempt is indeed ambitious, but unfortunately there is no possibility or opportunity for it to be realized.</p>
<p>To come back to the point: according to the above, it can be seen that Japanese warlords have completely failed morally, and China has already achieved spiritual victory. Now I will continue to explain: why can spiritual victory succeed in practical victory. Then you must know that the first thing in war is people, everything depends on people. And China's war of resistance, because it is absolutely voluntary and believes in the Three Principles of the People, has solved all problems related to people. The whole of China today has only one will and one task: that is, to resist aggression and build the country. And every Chinese person is very clear about the purpose and reason for resisting aggression. What is left is only technical problems and material problems. And the national wartime and post-war political and economic policies have already been determined, so the whole of China today has fundamentally no controversial issues, only hard work.</p>
<p>Of course, the enemy has occupied many of our places, but the spirit and will of the Chinese people in the occupied areas still forever support the country and will never be deceived by the enemy. As for the few traitors and rebels, they are the scum of the nation and will not affect the spirit and will of the entire nation at all. On the contrary, the more Japanese warlords try to use Chinese to control Chinese, the more the Chinese nation feels humiliated and strengthens its determination. In short, we are calm and optimistic. History has determined that the only difficult and bright road is for us to strive to walk. We can endure any hardship, and we should not be afraid of any sacrifice. Because today's suffering is the reward for insufficient efforts in the past. At the same time, today's sacrifice is the guarantee of future glory and happiness. Because we feel this common responsibility and maintain this consistent belief, although the environment is full of storms and waves, our mood is like a bright sky after rain. This is something that the aggressor country can never reach. To be honest, the solution to the problem of people in China was originally very difficult, especially the mentality of complacency and selfishness, which was extremely difficult to remove. However, since the war of resistance, the general public, because of their feelings for the loyal and brave soldiers and the pain of the country being broken and their homes destroyed, has actively brought their spirit and will to a climax; and passively made complacency and selfishness disappear naturally. I dare say that the degree of progress in the spirit and will of all our officers and soldiers, the young men who are conscripted into the army, the compatriots and comrades who are directly and indirectly engaged in various anti-war tasks in the north and south war zones, and the technical personnel and general workers who are working hard in transportation, production, and manufacturing in the front and rear is something that cannot be achieved in twenty years in peacetime. And the talents from all sectors of our education, academia, industry, and commerce, and the general male and female students and young people have all been sincere and hardworking in the past two years, making rapid progress. Therefore, I deeply feel the greatness of our nation and have confirmed the bright future of our country. Because war is about people, and we have mastered the advantage of people. And technology can be improved. Materials can be replenished. Why can't we fight? Why can't we win? Of course, the Japanese army's weapons and equipment are much larger than ours; but we are confident that we will make this gap smaller day by day and make the enemy armed but useless. Moreover, you have many ideological enemies, while we only have one enemy. So the more you invade China, the lower and more dangerous your international status will be; while we only fight this one battle. You are besieged on all sides, while we have the world as our friend. The final success or failure is self-evident.</p>
<p>Today, I am saying these words to you, the Japanese people, on behalf of the Chinese nation, based on the historical friendship between the two nations and the mission of the Three Principles of the People, with the spirit of loving my country and loving the enemy people, and giving you the most sincere advice. But at the same time, I declare that if you still follow the warlords, China will absolutely not be affected. Standing on the moral high ground, possessing endless manpower, and with an absolutely consistent belief in the Three Principles of the People, we will advance the war of resistance and nation-building at the same time. With the firm unity of the people's hearts internally and the assistance of fair public opinion from friendly countries externally, why can't we defeat this common enemy of the East Asian nations? Your force is omnipotent, but our Three Principles of the People is the strongest steel. In the end, we will see whether force wins or morality wins. I will not make predictions. The facts will prove it in the future!</p>
<p>4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The above points have been explained in great detail! And the reason why I said "The success of China's self-defense is not the failure of the Japanese people. The failure of the policy of aggression is precisely the success of the Japanese people." is probably understood by everyone. Now, in summary, I will offer a few more words to you.</p>
<p>China and Japan are neighboring countries and have had deep cultural ties since ancient times. This is a fact that we have always valued. We believers in the Three Principles of the People have the ideal of universal harmony in the world and have no prejudice against race or region. And for neighboring nations. Of course, we hope to be friendly. Therefore, even though we are in a bloody war, we have never despised the Japanese people emotionally, and because we firmly believe that there must be many sensible people among you. It's just that you have an unclear understanding and have been deceived by the warlords' propaganda, so today I am doing my duty and speaking frankly about right and wrong. This is entirely out of the moral intention of our nation and our principles. As for what I advise, first, you must thoroughly repent of your mistakes, and second, you must thoroughly change your policies.</p>
<p>Your warlords are absolutely wrong to want to destroy China. You must realize that the existence of a strong and prosperous Republic of China is in Japan's absolute interest. Therefore, if China becomes strong, peace in East Asia will be truly guaranteed. And the first one to benefit from this peace is Japan. Conversely, if China does not firmly resist aggression this time and becomes a Japanese colony; may I ask, don't the two million Korean people and the four million Taiwanese people, whom you mistakenly believe have been enslaved, all waiting for the opportunity to rebel? If you add 450 million Chinese people, who will harbor endless resentment towards Japan because they have been conquered, no matter how you exert all kinds of enslaving, poisoning, and destructive efforts, the long-standing, deep-rooted, and fundamental Chinese culture and national spirit can never be completely eliminated! At this time, tens of millions of you Japanese people will be ruled by warlords, preparing for war or fighting every day, and the political and economic situation will deteriorate day by day. In the end, a big storm will completely collapse Japan, and China and Korea can still take this opportunity to revive. Therefore, your warlords' policy of aggression is very harmful to others and to yourselves, harming China and also harming Japan. Therefore, the East Asia Development Board of your government is originally a "destroy China board" in meaning; but in the end, I am afraid it will become a "destroy Japan board." From this point of view, China's war of resistance is really beneficial to Japan. Because by relying on the strength of China's war of resistance, it is enough to break your warlords' delusion of omnipotence of force. At the same time, it is giving the Japanese people a good opportunity to save Japan from a major crisis. Therefore, I urge you to wake up quickly, repent quickly, and actively save yourselves quickly. What we Chinese soldiers and civilians rely on today to deal with the enemy is great benevolence and great courage. Even if the entire country of Japan is mobilized to attack China, we will become stronger as we fight on. At the same time, speaking of benefiting others, we feel the pain suffered by the Japanese people as if it were our own pain. The world is changing rapidly, and I urge you not to miss this opportunity to save yourselves!</p>
<p>As for how to save yourselves? First of all, you need to completely change your policy towards China and completely abandon aggression. I can tell you that you must definitely recognize and respect that China is an independent country with sacred sovereignty, just as we see Japan. And there should be no ambiguity in anything related to national sovereignty. Ambiguity will only lead to war. What's more, you still want to permanently occupy our territory and organize traitorous puppet governments? I urge you to recognize that the independent survival and development of the new China under the Three Principles of the People will not be hindered by Japan's military aggression. In the end, the only one who suffers is Japan itself. At the same time, let you quickly restore Eastern morality and recognize the true value of the Three Principles of the People. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Eastern morality of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. Among them, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace are the basis of our international policy. I advise you to also correct this, at least from now on, do not tell lies. Use every term according to its original meaning, and do not deceive. And we respect the personality of the Japanese country and people, and you should also be willing to respect China in the same way, and do not insult China.</p>
<p>Finally, I reiterate what I said last year: "The Chinese soldiers and civilians have always regarded the people who love peace and are deeply oppressed by the warlords as good friends with common interests, and care for them with full enthusiasm and expectation. We deeply hope that you will consider the supreme plan for the safety of your country and unite to oppose all the actions of the violent military department and exert the just will and strength of the citizens of your country!"</p>
<p>Japanese people! I believe you will remember and understand what I told you at this time last year. I hope you will recognize that the enemies of your country and nation are not in China, nor in the world, but in Japan. Please believe it, please think it over! (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>All Hong Kong Open Water Polo Tournament, two games will be held today at 8:15 p.m., (1) West Youth Association vs. Victoria (West Youth Association Swimming Pool), (2) Chung Sing vs. Chinese (Chung Sing Swimming Pool). Since Tudor came to play, he has never been defeated. On the 6th of this month, veterans Roland Tuo-Pa-La-La made their debut together and defeated the strong team Chung Sing. It is expected that the West Youth Association will follow suit today. There will be a fierce battle in the Chung Sing vs. Chinese match, because the Chinese side has the big man Song Yaode, who is strong and powerful, and Niu Bo Chen Xipei's heavy artillery will be greatly blocked. It is not easy to guess who will win.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Cradle of Chinese Sports in Hong Kong The Lease of South China Field Is About to Expire Rumor Has It That the Government Intends to Take It Back and Use It as the New Site for Queen's College <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's English weekly newspaper reported that the ten-year lease of the South China Stadium on Caroline Hill will expire. The government plans to take it back. The sports community is very concerned about this. Since the establishment of the stadium, Chinese schools have often held sports meets at the stadium. At the same time, Hong Kong's football matches are also the most lively at the stadium. If it is taken back, it will have a huge impact on the sports community. It is rumored that the government's intention to take back the stadium is to build Queen's Hospital. This plan has been discussed for a long time, but it was finally abandoned. It is extremely likely that the site will be used for other construction purposes. It is also rumored that the government is planning to build a model new village there and choose the headquarters of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade on Tai Hang Road as the new site for the school. However, the Director of Education admitted yesterday that the government intends to take back the South China Stadium and said that Caroline Hill is only one of the locations that the new Queen's College has in mind. As for the South China Athletic Association, it has not received any notification. It is rumored that the government also has a strong interest in sports and knows that once this site is taken back, it will inevitably affect the development of the association, so it has not made a final decision.</p>

<h3 id="e62">"New Gymnastics" Movements and Methods (II) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>(5) Same-Side "8" Character Shape: Both arms move simultaneously from a hanging position, swinging upwards and to the right-rear side towards the front of the body, then drooping down from the front of the body, swinging upwards and to the left-rear side towards the front of the body, tracing an "8" shape in front of the body.</p>
<p>2. "Vibration" Movements: This type of movement emphasizes shortness and speed. Each vocalization should be accompanied by one or two vibrations. If it is an opening and closing vibration, then each time the arms close, one arm must be above or in front. After completing a set, if you feel muscle tension, you can add relaxation movements to adjust.</p>
<p>(1) Forward and Backward Vibration: Both arms vibrate forward and backward, with the arms kept straight. The arm position can be divided into three types: hanging down, sideways raised, and raised up. When performing sideways raised vibrations, the palms face downward. When performing hanging down and raised up vibrations, the palms face each other.</p>
<p>(2) Upward and Downward Vibration: Both arms are straightened and vibrate up and down. These can be divided into sideways raised and forward raised types. When performing sideways raised vibrations, the palms face downward. When performing forward raised vibrations, the palms face each other.</p>
<p>(3) Opening and Closing Vibration: Both arms are straightened and moved in an alternating opening and closing motion. This can be divided into four types: hanging down and opening/closing in front of the body, hanging down and opening/closing in front and behind the body, forward raised and opening/closing in front of the chest, and raised up and opening/closing above the head.</p>
<p>3. "Punching" Movements: This movement is a vigorous exercise, primarily focusing on the full contraction of muscles. However, the muscle contraction only occurs during the punch, and the muscles must relax when retracting. The lower limbs can freely flex and extend or touch the ground with the toes as the punch is delivered.</p>
<p>(1) National Arts Punching Method: Both fists are brought up from a flexed position near the waist, and then punched out. When punching out, the back of the fist must face upward, and when retracting, the back of the fist must face downward. This can be divided into punching downward, punching sideways, punching upward, and punching the left fist to the right, and the right fist to the left. The first three types can be further divided into punching simultaneously with both fists or alternately.</p>
<p>(2) Western Boxing Forward Punch: The foot is taken out of the upright position (left fist forward, right foot forward). Both fists are first placed in front of the chest in preparation. The rear fist punches forward first, while the front fist quickly retracts. Immediately, the front fist punches forward, while the rear fist quickly retracts. After performing this a sufficient number of times, the stance must be switched, and the feet and fists moved forward.</p>
<p>(3) Western Boxing Hook: From the position where both fists are still at the side of the body, the left fist punches to the right, and the right fist punches to the left in an alternating hooking motion. The arm is bent when punching, and the fist stops when it reaches the head, without straightening. The objective is to hit the opponent's chin.</p>
<p>(4) Western Boxing Uppercut: The same starting position as above. The left and right fists alternately punch upwards from in front of the body. The fist stops when it reaches the jaw. The objective is to hit the opponent's jaw.</p>
<p>4. "Pulling" Movements: For this movement, the application of muscles is precisely the opposite of the punching movement. That is, tightening during the pull back, opening the fingers during the reach, and clenching the fingers tightly during the pull back. The movement can be divided into pulling upwards from below, pulling downwards from above, pulling backward from the front, and pulling inwards from both sides. Each movement can be performed with both arms simultaneously or alternately.</p>
<p>5. "Circling" Movements: This type of movement can be broadly categorized into circling small circles and circling large circles. The movement of circling small circles is similar to the "vibration" movement. The movement of circling large circles is similar to the "swinging" movement. However, the amount of exercise for both is increased compared to "vibration" and "swinging". Since we have understood the "vibration" and "swinging" movements, the "circling" movement is not difficult. The only difference is that the "vibration" and "swinging" movements are modified to circle a circle. Therefore, we are only giving its name and will not explain it in detail.</p>
<p>(1) Circling Small Circles: Can be divided into sideways raised circling, forward raised circling, and raised up circling. Sideways raised circling can be divided into moving from front-up-back-down and from front-down-back-up. Forward raised and raised up circling can be divided into moving from inside to outside and from outside to inside.</p>
