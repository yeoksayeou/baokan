<h3>汪精衛言動在法律上所負之責任</h3>
<p>— 鋤非</p>
<p>注精衛曩以國民黨副總裁中政會副主席國防最高會議副議長國民參政會議長，於團結　侮堅决抗戰旣定之國策，忽而獨持異議，擅離其職守，發表絕電，與近衛文磨之聲明作應聲，舉國譁然，羣起而口誅筆伐，已使汪精衛體無完膚。顧乃牢執已見，復於其御用之××××　報，發表『舉一個例』之文字，××××××××××××，風起雲湧，益為衆矢所集。不佞從事律師，生活於法律，本事實證據以立論，故於重慶大公報所傳其與平沼之祕密協定，譯員方面獲得，。而其他如×人以其艶電由飛機散發，南京僞『大民會』之為播音演講，嘉興僞『大民會』之為通電響應，僞「東亞反共會」之去電擁護，尤其是某僞報之不斷的歌頌揄揚，之根據，刑事係採眞實發見主義，故對於汪精衛之。</p>
<p>茲所論者，汪精衛負黨國中樞本兼各職之重任，際此國難嚴電之時期，不惜棄職越境，以示與政府之不合作，是於公務員懲戒法第二條第二欵「廢弛職務或其他失職行為」之應與資任者一也。</p>
<p>歲會通例，少數服從多數，一經表决通過、舍復議外無反對餘地。國防最高會議及國民參政會之議事細則，雖未及見，無從引證，但依民權初步，當不外此原則。抗戰國策，旣經國防最高會議議决，而國民參政曾，又迭發擁護宣言，汪精衛於國防最高會議旣當副議長，而於國民參政會又身為議長，苟認為有利於國，儘可在會內發表其自信之主張。第旣經大衆所不採，則其主張之無論如何光明正大，而確無背景，亦祇能犧牲己見，服從衆議，以符會議之通則。乃於經衆公决之案，妄於會外通電反汗，其民主政治精神，抑何相遠之甚？是於議會規程之應負責任者又一也。</p>
<p>國與國間，政府與人民間，固常有祕密性之例應保守者。國防最高會議第五十四次常務委員會議情形，雖無關於國防計劃，然足以見政府外交上應付之策略，是其應守祕密，毫無疑義。汪精衛亦自承為此等事實，為國家利害計，有嚴守祕密之必要，乃諉謂『過去事實，不妨為之公表，以作一個例子』，則凡巳成事實，何一非過去者？汪精衛曾任外交部長，其所身經所知悉有關國交之事實多矣，是皆過去而顧可公表者乎，其謬孰甚！是于刑法上第壹百三十二條『洩漏關於中華民國國防以外應祕密之文書消息』之應負責任者又其一也。</p>
<p>且言動自由，不守黨紀，在黨的立場，尤屬應負責任，更無待言。至於汪精衛暴一個例原文所稱當時蔣委員長對於德大使所述，固明明謂『對日本未能置信』，且有『擬請德國先慫恿日本停戰』為言，是於德大使所提各節，本未有肯定之承認，其所引證，顯屬斷章取義，因無關法律上之論據，不涉本論範圍，茲不贅。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年四月卅日至五月六日</p>
<p>踏進了悲壯的戰鬥的五月！</p>
<p>世界和中國，時事的演變，更增加我們推進悲壯的戰鬥的勇氣和決心。</p>
<p>兩條陣綫的戰鬥，踏進了五月以後，開始小的波動，小小的變化。民主和平國家方面，英國當局的政策還沒有積極的表現，影響了反侵略陣綫之進展的遲緩，蘇聯終於實行了斷然的行動。戰爭？和平？快有更明顯的演出了吧！</p>
<p>侵略國家方面，又在進行新的陰謀，德意日三國領袖會議了整整一個星期，還沒有結束！不過東方侵略者的日本，則已更明顯地向××××××××××××，向中國開始了更無人性的轟炸和××，一方面反證了牠的「跳牆」的窘急，另一方面也提高了全體正義人類對牠的敵愾。</p>
<p>（一）英國反侵略的姿態</p>
<p>『反侵略集團』在英國資本家政府領導之下，仍有相當的進展，如英蘇談判之繼續進行，英法合作的續有進展，英王英后的定期前往加拿大和美國，甚至還傳出了同時以英法蘇波土五國為基幹而組織『十三國反侵略大同盟』的消息（一日哈瓦斯社倫敦電）但是，所有這些，並未能充分表明英政府業已决心放棄其一實的妥協政策。而且，實際上英政府却還存在一種幻想，企圖利用這種『反侵略大同盟』的姿態，來分化日德意侵略集團，來復活四强集團，來鼓勵德國東進，重新抬起業已破爛的反蘇聯的大旗。因此代表英政府的報紙，傳出了希特勒演　中留有『和平地步』的消息，傳出了日本决不參加德意軍事同盟的消息，面在對蘇合作談判中，則堅持其反對集體安全制度的　　實現，堅持反侵略陳綫决不色括還東在內。這種行為，綱然是推進反侵略陣綫的阻碍，而且再一次的帮助了德國，使牠獲得一個討價還價的機會，事實上更增加了世界和平的危機！</p>
<p>「二」德意首腦部的活動</p>
<p>不切實的不澈底的『反侵略集團』的姿態，實授法西斯侵略者以可乘之隙，而且帮助牠們獲得從容準備進一步　略挑戰的機會。</p>
<p>第一是德意兩國陸軍當局的舉行參謀會議。德國降軍總司令勃勞希區於四月廿九日率領軍官多人，抵趕羈馬，卽與畢索里尼會晤，並與意陸軍當　舉行重要會談，四月卅日五月一日，再度與墨索里尼及西班牙軍事代表團作長時間的商談，於一日始飛往里比亞。第二，德航空部長戈林，繼於五月四日晚專車抵聖　摩，卽與意國首腦部進行談話。第三，是德外長里賓特羅甫夫婦，於四日晚偕同外次及其他外　重要人目乘快車赴意，五日下午起與意外長舉行關於應付波蘭但　　南斯拉夫地位等重要問題。第四，是德國之繼續爭奪民主國的衛星國家，首先是拉攏北歐國家，使各國在戰時守『中立』，官方於五月四日已先宣佈與拉特維亞訂結不侵犯條約，現又進與愛沙尼亞，挪威，瑞典，丹麥，芬蘭等國活動。第五，是德意之繼續擴軍，德國旣在進行六艘新式鐵甲巡洋艦等建造工作，意國更因在西班牙所受軍事損失過重，而力謀充實軍力，廿九日意內閣通過了增强陸軍案，撥五十萬萬里拉調整陸軍，同時加緊訓練空車，擴充空軍實力。由此司見對於侵略者的放鬆，實際上是增加了民主與和平的威脅！</p>
<p>（三）日本新攻略的實施</p>
<p>看透了反侵略運動尚存的缺陷。看透了民主國家特別是英國目前政策中的可乘之條。遠東侵略者的日本，就更狡滑更猖狂地實施其新的攻略。</p>
<p>日本和德意首腦間在一週來不斷接洽，從五月四日柏林當局之否認『德意日三國正進行軍事談判』一事可以反證，而日本首腦部則亦於一週來不斷舉行會議，商定了所謂對歐政策，表面上宣稱：『關於與德意締結軍事同盟，日本自有其獨立的外交政策，但日本不欲開罪民主及極權國家，而欲與世界各國保持及增進友好關係』，這顯然是看透了民主國尤其是英政府目前外交政策中依然存在的妥協的本質，而舉行其誘惑的狡計。</p>
<p>但同時，第一，日本又開始了對於上海租界的壓迫，雖然租界當局勇於屈服，如對華文報紙一再施行壓力。而日本仍有非獨佔租界政權不可之勞。第二，日本開又始了對華中華南各大城市實行慘×××的狂轟濫炸，特別是張英大使在重慶與我中樞會商增進中英合作關係的時候，於五月三日四日大舉轟炸重慶。</p>
<p>日本侵略者一面實行誘惑，一面實行威脅，其根本原因就是因為對於侵華戰事巳失勝利把握，而且在我堅待團結抗戰之下，日本泥足　陷愈深，因此力圖以『友好』的誘餌來阻止英國的親蘇援華；同時想以完全燬滅英國在華中華南利益的强硬手段來帮助『誘策』，××英國××。日駐英大使重光癸並曾於四月廿七日預向英國警告，促請放棄　　援華政策。而英外相則說：『英國並　推行此　政策，故並　變更對華現行政策之必要』。這雖是兩面討好的外交詞令，但對於為×人服務的漢奸可以作為一種打擊吧？然而，這是多麼不够啊！</p>
<p>（四）共產國際重要宣言</p>
<p>在這國際形勢萬分危急的時候，指出若干民主和平國家繼續妥協政策兩而政策的禍患，是更感必要了！指出法西斯侵略者不僅威脅小國家而且刀鋒已經向準全世界要求民主共和平的人類這一事實，已　更感必要了！指出全人類尤其是勤勞大眾在目前兩條戰綫的鬥爭中的緊急任務，尤其是更感必要了。</p>
<p>五月一日那天，偉大的國際勞動節日，共產國際發表了一篇對世界命　具有决定力量的重要的宣言，這篇宣言籲請英美法各國工人，與一切反法西斯反侵略的戰士們，一致聯合起來，對法西斯侵略者施行經濟的。軍事的，及政治的制裁。這篇宣言還持別鄭重地籲請全世界勞工大衆，援助英勇抗戰的中國，努力解放捷克斯拉夫，阿爾巴尼亞，西班牙，和阿比西尼亞。</p>
<p>在蘇聯，五日一日是全世界最熱烈的一天，全國舉行盛大的祝典，舉行反對法西斯反對侵略者的示威巡行。莫斯科紅塲舉行大檢閱，明斯克及基輔各地都舉行大操。紅軍的勞工，協同了廣大的集體農場農民和社會主義的知識份子。到處發出『反法西斯反侵略』的怒吼，呼喊出『援助中國，解放被壓迫民族』的口號。這種怒吼與口號，不僅將激勵全世界的勤勞大衆，前進人士，和民主和平各國的民衆，而且還將激起一切正在法西斯侵略者壓迫下的牠們本國及其殖民地的羣眾。</p>
<p>全世界勤勞大眾統一戰綫的鞏固與擴大，由這一統一戰綫來推進反法西斯反侵略運動，將是制止業已爆發的第二次帝國主義大戰的主要力量！但大家要知道，不是坐待而是奮起的時候了！</p>
<p>（五）蘇聯採取積極行動</p>
<p>在本週，蘇聯採取了積極的斷然的行動。</p>
<p>第一，是蘇聯之努力進行組織黑海國家的集體安全，用以代替軟弱無力的英法對土的片方面保障。（一日中央社土京電。蘇聯外交人民副委員長波丹金與土耳其當局討論成立黑海國家與英法合作問題，此項計劃規定在戰爭時開放韃靼納爾海峽，准許反侵略國家之軍艦通行。）</p>
<p>第二，蘇聯黑海艦隊在黑海東南土耳其沿岸海面，舉行大演習，于五月一日圓滿結束。艦隊司令奧特亞波斯基表示，對該艦隊戰鬥能力，完全滿意，認為在此德國勢力侵及黑海之際，蘇聯艦隊足以應付一切緊急事件。</p>
<p>第三，蘇聯與波蘭的邦交更臻密切，波蘭亦胆敢開始堅持強硬態度，以對付德國之步步進迫。五月五日，波籣外長柏克並在舉世注目中發表了答覆德國的</p>
<p>第四，蘇聯以人民委員長莫洛托夫兼代李維諾夫為外交人民委員長，此舉可謂對於英法的兩面政策的嚴正的教訓，而日前電訊所傳蘇聯已允反侵略　綫不擴展到遠東的謠言，亦因此粉碎無餘。蘇聯當局一再昭示天下：『蘇聯力能擊敗任何侵略者從東西兩方同時進攻』！『蘇聯並不需要任何軍事同盟三角同盟』！現在英洛托夫兼任外長，並已下令取消新聞檢查，更是一新國際人士的耳目。而証明了蘇聯國內空前團結和力量的充實，已經不懼任何陰謀毒計！蘇聯道種積極的行動，自然是表明蘇聯之努力反侵略運動，完全為了實現蘇聯維　世界和平與解放被壓迫民族的政策，為了實現維護民主政治促進人類文化進步的政策，絕無任何自私自利或其他企圖的意味。因此，我們相信蘇聯這種行動，將提　目前仍舊抱着妥協與反蘇幻想的民主和平國家，將警告一切走向侵略擴大帝國主義戰爭之路的國家，更將證實蘇聯實力的雄偉和提高蘇聯在國際上眞正維護和平的威信。</p>
<p>（六）抗日戰爭最近形勢</p>
<p>在這兩條戰綫的鬥爭中，作為反法西斯反侵略陣綫之主力軍與先鋒隊的中國的抗日部隊，繼續獲得應有的　利。統計四月下半個月，作計作戰五〇四次，斃×官兵三萬一千九百六十五名，俘×官兵五百十二名，其地繳獲軍實破壞交通及擊沉×艦擊落×幾。匯未計算在內。這一週，抗日軍在各路前綫，繼續獲勝。贛北方面，繼續反攻奉新南昌，使×軍支離疲敝，使湘那贛進形勢為之穩定。那中方面，×軍又有西犯模樣，而以奪取官昌為目的；但經我抗日軍先機採取攻勢，於五月三日渡越襄河，分路出擊，克復漢宜公路多　　，羅漢寺，泗港市等三要點，同時邵東麻城，亦告克復，因此　中×軍亦遭挫敗。華南戰塲稍感沉寂，而西江形勢，則趨好轉。華北方面，×　　到大批新兵，但大體上已經無活動能力，戰事已有進入相待階段之勢，東戰場反攻軍事已較上週略有進展。蘇北及京滬綫均有戰事，而新四軍又在京杭道上　捷，以衡入宜興紀念五一，經過血戰三日，予×以重大打擊。</p>
<p>日本侵略軍，則處處遭遇攻擊與挫敗，而內部情勢又愈趨不穩。前偽蒙事一師二三團三一連長楊興華等全　反正（二日桂林電）。天津×軍反戰，于上月廿四日縱火焚燬倉庫的消息亦經證，而且牽涉華北×軍官兵甚多，使×　杉山元焦灼萬分。問時政治陰謀亦遭挫敗，汪精衛反共和平的活動遭遇全中國民族痛恨，外交上對英誘脅亦在我堅強的態度之下無甚收獲，而在佔領區的經濟金融政策所受打擊尤為慘重，偽幣毒計幾已全部失敗。日×為了挽教末運，乃又决心不顧一切，瘋狂暫檢，向我華中華南及華西各主州，三日四日，連總狂炸重慶，而浙江的寧波，廣東的潮汕，亦連日慘遭狂炸。配合這種無人性的狂炸之後。也許還會繼之以所謂大舉進軍。然而也正因為×軍的困難日益嚴重，我們不僅不會因此畏縮妥協，而且益增仇　與抗戰的决心，谷增堅持抗戰必獲勝利的信心，所以×軍必仍遭失敗，可說已是預定的了。不過我們回首祖國，烽火遍地，城市為墟，同　血靡，凡有人心，能無悲情？援　前綫，拯救難民，囘國服務，擴大捐輸等，是更迫急地需要我們去努力進行了！</p>

<h3>英閣外委會　通過致蘇覆牒　避免訂立軍事同盟　重提聯合防御東歐</h3>
<p>【中央社倫敦五日電】內閣外交委員會，本日舉行會議、討論法國政府意見書（按英政府擬向蘇聯提出之對案、曾經送達法國政府請其表示意見）當卽擬就訓令電達駐蘇聯大使西慈爵士、着其以照會致送該國新任人民外交委員長莫洛托夫、此間外交界人士，咸謂，英國政府之意、以李維諾夫之去職、並非蘇聯改變外交政策之謂、非然者、卽不致再度向蘇聯政府提出照會，此項照會內容如何、官場方面並未有所透露，</p>
<p>【美社聯倫敦五日電】英內閣外交委員會頃通過備忘錄一通，謂英國在目前情彩下、不能接納蘇聯成立三國軍事同盟之要求、該備忘錄通過後、外相哈立法克斯卽行送交駐蘇英大使、轉達蘇外長、內容對於蘇聯之建議、並非拒絕、而僅言及目前不能加以接納之理由、據英國發言人稱、英國雖作如是答復、但將來成立軍事協定之門戶並未關閉、張伯倫現正等候蘇聯方面對此之反響，希望因此而明瞭蘇聯外交政策、是否因李維諾夫之辭職而有所變動英國復牒中曾鄭重聲明、當英、法實際從事援助被壓迫國家時、然後方期望蘇聯加人反侵略陣線，英國此舉、顯係用以解除蘇聯之憂慮、蓋蘇聯恐將來自身被捲入漩過、而英、法助袖手旁觀也、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦五日電】外相哈立法克斯、擬於今日訓令英國駐蘇大使西慈、往訪莫洛托夫、並提出英國對於蘇聯建議之答覆、據悉、英國擬避免蘇聯建議訂立英，法、蘇三國軍事同盟、而重新提出英、法、蘇應準備防禦東歐諸國、制止畧侵、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦五日電】據路透社外交訪員稱、英政府將於最近期間內、向駐莫斯科英大使發出關於英國答覆蘇政府建議之訓令、倫敦方面認為、英政府所提出之覆牒內容、將對蘇方建議原則、概予維持、同時附加名主要聯台國對於抵抗侵畧之各項計劃意見、</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦五日電】外次巴特勒今日在下議院答覆詢問時謂英政府目前無意將波羅的海之立陶宛，拉達維亞，及愛沙尼亞三國包括在英國保護或互助協定中云、</p>
<p>【路透社莫斯科五日電】蘇聯最高會議、定五月廿五日召集開會、</p>
<h3>波蘭態度堅決　否認德國有權毀約　法宣言聲明援波</h3>
<p>【路透社華沙五日電】波蘭政府之覆牒、對最近德國通牒聲言廢棄德波一九三四年所訂之協定一事、提出答覆、其內容否認英波諒解不能與德波不相侵犯公約同時存在、並緊言希特勒無權廢棄該約、德國政府如能重視善隊政策、而以公式成建議、則波蘭政府定必依據波蘭觀點、準備誠意攷慮云、</p>
<p>【路透社護沙六日電】波蘭外長柏克上校昨演說終結時、采聲雷動、當議會通過演辭時、卽烏克蘭代表、亦同聲稱讚、前為波蘭攻取維爾那之英雄斯里高斯基將軍、一向反對柏克之政策、此時亦從座上　出、趨前與柏克握手道賀、軸心國均無代表出席旁　、一般視察、柏克之演詞、雖溫和而堅決、足以表示波蘭擁　　平之誠意、然亦必須以不損害榮譽為原則、</p>
<p>【路透社華沙五日電】示威民衆今日在波外部羣集要、要求一見外長柏克、柏克為應民衆之熱情、特在看台出現、與民衆相見、並作簡知之演說、聲言外交相競之時期業已過去、今後全國應抱堅决之態度五、</p>
<p>【海通社巴黎五日電】關於法國忠誠維持對波信約之决心、遠拉第曾發表宣言加以證實、今晨各報、均以顯　地位登載達拉第之宣言、但各報之論調則略有不同、據政界之意，總理此舉、實因社會共和黨代表馬些爾、曾在報端發表一文、主張法人不應為波蘭對但澤及東普魯士之過份要求而作戰、故特發表聲言，用申法國之信義、據「時代報』今晨消息、波蘭大使羅卞巴維士、昨曾特為馬些兩之文章向外長龐　致牒查問、外長當卽保證該文絕對不能影響法國之態度、而法國政府决信守成約、並傳　萊曾向波大使聲言、一俟波蘭感覺其主要權益受有威脅時、法國即當自動出而援助、所謂中要權益者、乃指但澤方面而言、波大使對總理之宣言、表示滿意云、</p>
<p>英法兩國　印象極佳</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦六日電】此間報界熱烈　護波蘭外長柏克之演說、謂該演說實質堅决，措詞溫和，「每日電聞報』稱，「如柏克外長之演說、未能使緊張之情勢、趨於懈她、此亦非柏克之過失、希特勒拒絕友好之談判、固未能有任何藉口也』、「新聞紀事報』稱、「柏克演詞未含有挑撥性、唯淸確表明，任何攫取及歸併世澤之企圖、必將遭遇波蘭全國之抵抗也』、「泰晤士報』稱、一柏克外長對於波蘭之態度、已有良好之陳述此項陳述、包括堅强之國民情緒及建設性之建議、雙方均可以平靜合理之談判、解决有關之問題、而無須戰爭、但如企圖實施武力解决方法、則必將使一地方爭執事件、轉變為廿界不再準備容忍之重要問題也，』</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦五日電】柏克演說、倫敦方面曾加縝密研究，各方面對此印象極佳、惟官方尚未發表任何公報，外交界方面，以該演說措詞中和明確，實為最優異之處、現咸　目於德國對此之反響為何、但澤國社　領袖二人、現正在　樞台斯加登與希特勒舉行會商、此舉至堪注意、蓋捷克事件可為先例也、外交界更指出柏克演說當中、曾論及單方面的廢除德波不侵略條約行為凡與德國訂有此項條約者、觀此亦應有所警惕矣、</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎五是電】此　對柏克上校之演說認為平和、堅决及有政治家之丰度、關於但澤一節、用意固在拒絕德方之要求，但因其措詞巧妙、故任何人均不能視之為具有挑撥性、凡希望德國乘機轉園而與波蘭尋求和平之解决辦法奢、更可以稍為樂觀矣、羅傳意正欲向此途徑出任調人云，一般揣測，柏克此次詞意之堅决、加以英、法最近曾發表宣言、切實表明如波蘭遭逼侵略、自必挺身援助、則德國應知各民主國並非徒尚空言、若仍貿然冀圖在波羅的海方面再度表演其併吞捷克之所為者、勢必引起大戰，</p>
<p>德國官方　表示不滿</p>
<p>【路透　柏林五日電】希特勒今日整日下午與外長里賓特羅甫及但澤國社黨領袖在柏樞台斯加登討論波外長柏克演說、　　　羅甫定今晚起程赴意大利、德國之態度、雖非俟將波蘭止式答復、及將　克演說均詳加研究後、不致形成、然非官方對柏克演說之首次印象、認為波蘭巳趨！墮落』、德人現正聚訟紛　，討論德國不廢一彈而佔有但澤之可能性、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林五日電】德國官方對於柏市演說之意見、今晚會刊諸「外交通訊報」中，其澈底反對柏克演詞之議論、頗如希特勒最近之答復羅新福、據稱柏克上校力　飾詞　護自三月底以來波蘭政策之急劇變化、但柏克若謂其　然變吏其一九三四年之政策及加入英國之包圍陣綫、而能獲得德國之容恕者、誠屬錯誤、此點必須聲明云，官方通訊社並將柏克上校今晚之演詞，括出一節、在某報上揭載、其　題為「柏克錯圖轉移視聽！拒絕德國建議』，同時各報更大量登載謠傳波人排德之消息、其中有謂波人在波森集結巡行、並故意造一個希特勒之偶像，吊於斷頭台上、並在德領館外舉行示威、高聲辱罵云，</p>
<p>羅國重視　蘇聯政策</p>
<p>【路透社羅馬五日電】莫索里尼喉舌蓋達、頃在「意大利日報」著文評論柏克演說、警告波蘭避免採取一「虛張聲　態度」以反對德國、彼更勸告波蘭、祇可為其自身利益設想、萬不能容許其本身利益為他人利益所擱置、蓋達繼指出純因莫索里尼個人之干預及意大利之行動、然後波匈邊界問題、方能願波蘭之意向、而謀得解决、</p>
<p>【路透社羅馬尼亞京城五日電】消息靈通方面批評柏克上校之演說、足以代表强硬、尊嚴及决心、同時並謂其語氣並無凌迫之勢、卽對於德、波將來就平等之立場相互討論解决但澤及走廊之問題一節、柏克上校亦未嘗不留有磋商之餘地、實際上將來蘇聯採取何種政策，尤較柏克上校之演說為重要、李維諾夫辭職後、已逾四十八小時、而蘇聯尚未發表任何聲言，申明其外父政策、此點事實、搔堪注意云、一般推測、史塔林若有維持李維諾天之政策之意（　然　節上稍有更變）、則莫斯科早應有所聲明云、</p>

<p>名外交家陳友仁氏、昨日接見新聞記者，暢談波蘭走廊與但澤問題，以及英、蘇軍事同盟、對於遠東之影響、</p>
<p>歐洲方面</p>
<p>渠謂「如希特勒深信向波蘭推進、不致引起歐洲之大戰、則渠必欲堅持以納粹方式解决但澤之地位、幷建築公路、貫通波蘭走廊、但如蘇聯不干涉德國行動、以支持波蘭、則不致發生歐戰、在此種情形之下、張伯倫甚易後得法外龐萊之同意、而再沿　尼黑之路以引導「最少抵抗之獅子』、此事實甚為可能也、李維諾失辭職之確實原因、現尚未悉、巴黎某右翼報紙宣稱、繼李維諾夫任蘇外長之莫洛托夫、對於蘇聯與資本主義國家間之合作、反對甚烈、如此乃確實者、則英、蘇軍事同盟之締結、或未能必定實現、如此項軍事問盟未能成立、則對於張伯倫歐陸政策之新發展、實有嚴重之影響、惟對於中國、仍無不利、中國可使克里寧相信東方之重要、而在未遭遇西方之納粹危險前、消除日本之威脅、設李維諾夫辭職後、仍能訂立英蘇軍事同盟、則此同盟對于中國抗戰究有何利害耶、此項同盟旣為英國對蘇聯歐洲邊境之保證、則蘇聯蘇對其西方邊境安全之關注、自可减少、而對於中國之援助、可以增加矣、</p>
<p>遠東方面</p>
<p>如中國不包括於英、蘇同盟範圍以內、則英國必堅持蘇聯軍力集中於西方、以應付德國之侵略、幷竭力反對蘇聯軍力「分散」於遠東、英國此種政策之發展、不僅對於中國抗戰、極為危險、幷或將在專心、「綏靖』如張伯倫先生者之手中、實行調停「和平』、英國之統治階級、現已呈顯此種預兆、駐華英大使寇爾已安全之上海、而留於迭遭空　之重慶、駐日英大使克萊琪于寇爾大使赴渝之前夕抵滬相會、據美聯社東京電訊稱、此兩大使之會談或可謂「英國調停中日戰爭之先驅』、而四日前之倫敦中國協會宴會、中英國防調整大臣查達裴爾德動爵、亦預見遠東中、日兩國之合作、在理論上言之、吾人對於英國之調停和平、不能加以反對、然眞正和平之槪念、必須表示中國在此艱難困舌之戰爭中、獲得生存、幷日趨强大、繼續為一主權獨立領土完整之國家、中國對於實際割讓土地、或在「東亞新秩序』藉口下之歸併於日本帝國（如高　之被併）之和平談判、决予拒絕、藝汝對於决心殺汝者、决不能談判和平、汝唯一可與之討論者、惟汝之葬禮耳」、</p>

<h3>國際現勢縱隊橫談　（續）</h3>
<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>據二月初間業經證實之消息，美國當局巳特許法國向其採購軍用飛機，其貨值聞達一千三百萬鎊之鉅。並傳羅斯福總統於參議院軍事委員會席上，　述美國有　助民主國家對抗獨裁者之必要；並謂將以行動貫澈其主張。售機與法，卽其一端，如遇機緣，當予其他民主國以同樣之援助·更有謂　斯福氏曾　言『美國前線在法國』者·一時國內輿論之反響，毀譽交集。擁護之者則謂，「英，法購機之舉，無異以現金之代價，以取得代吾國（指美國）鞏固其國防前哨之特權·此次之交易，對於吾人實不勝其幸運·在國防之立場言，目前接濟英，法飛機一架，其效用等於六閱月後增加吾國空軍飛機十架·良以美國和平興安全之外衛線乃英，法而非大西洋，此殆昭然若揭者也。』（見紐約世界電訊報）。同時非難之者，其理由大別為三：（一）出售軍用飛機，有暴露國防秘密之歸。（二）目前當局雖無禁止供給德，意軍用器材之明文，而事實上必在取締之列，殆無疑義。今循法國之請，而予以接濟，無異輕彼重此，其勢必使美國牽入歐戰　渦而後已。（三）售機與法，將促德國加緊其空軍之擴充，至是美國亦斷難甘居人後。其結果適足以增加國民無謂之負祖！綜合羅斯福總統之答辯，除鄭重聲明售機之　並無洩　軍事秘密外，祇謂此舉之目的有二：其一則在使　　之工廠得以復業，失業人民　資救濟。其次則在促進飛機工業之適度續展，以　　防之需·至於輕彼重此，將牽該國入於歐戰漩渦之　議，則禾加駁斥。有問如德，意申請購機，政府是否拒絕者，羅斯　氏則應之曰，此乃「假設』之問，不必致答·其絃外之音，不特智者而知也！</p>
<p>羅斯　總統制裁侵略之决心固已昭然若揭，惟其主張究能貨澈至　何租度　？此殆吾人所急欲探討者·美為三權鼎立之國家，按其憲法之規定，行政元首。　為全國海陸軍大元帥，並有訂立條約及委派使節之細；惟任何集約之訂立及使節之委派，均須經參院之批准與同意方能生效，至於宣戰大權則槪操自國會之手·似此情形，總統之影響似甚微薄；惟揆諸史乘，該國之外交大計，由其行政元首及使節秘密商訂而不經國會之批准者，　則比比皆是。例如，婦孺皆知之門羅主義，其　釀之初；乃由美總統與英國外交當局秘密洽商，取得英國以武力為後盾之默契；其成立也，祇由門羅總統及外交部長（John　Quincy　Adamg）人正式公佈，旣未衛求國會之同意，復未經參議院之批准，而舉國上下，遂受此政策之約束矣·又如當狄奧多羅斯福總統出任調處日俄戰爭之際，氏竟秘密警告德，法，不得援助帝俄；否則美國不惜助日以對抗·是為該國總統進行秘密外交之尤者·一九二〇年自威爾遜總統躬親參興草擬之凡爾　條約遭參議院拒絕批准後，繼任諸子，鑒於前車之　　，對於國際關係之秘密協商莫不　足不前·例如，一九三一年胡佛總統為緩和歐洲之經濟恐慌而特許歐洲戰債延付一年之舉，事前紛紛　求　會之意見，方敢進行洽商，其愼重有如此者·雖然，國會之限制固嚴，惟總統左右外交之途經尚多·</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>慶祝青年節大會</h3>
<p>全港靑平於今日在孔聖堂聯合舉行慶祝靑年節大會·在　國正受×人轟炸屠殺的今天，在祖國抗戰進入新的艱苦階段的今天，我們對於這次全港靑年的大集會，覺得應該加以十二分的重視</p>
<p>靑年節，是從五四運動以來千萬先烈與先進們爭求民族解放的熱血上面誕生的！因此我們令天紀念靑年節，人人都應十二分的嚴肅，緊張，人人都應追念先烈與先進們為國家民族而不惜犧牲以與侵略者漢好費國賊英勇鬥爭的精神。現在時勢如此艱難，侵略者與漢好賣國賊更加瘋在兇惡，國家民族的命脉都在我們靑年手裏，我們應該如何尊重目己，鞭策自己才是啊！</p>
<p>全港靑年大聯合，這是空前的，是值得紀念的日子，我們要從今天起，大家親密地團結起來，携手邁進，結成堅固的統一戰綫，如果在「禮成散會』之後仍是一盤散沙，這不僅是辜負了這次大聯合的意義，而且也太對不起我們的組國與同胞了！且也太對不起我們的先烈先進和我們自己了！每一個人都要决心自責，如果我在這次盛會中不能努力主張或促成靑年團體的經常的團結，則是一次嚴重的失敗，而應面紅慚愧的！</p>
<p>靑年自新運動，這對於本港各界靑年，確是非常重要的·但我們希望各界靑年，尤其是靑年領袖們，能够同時注意到目前靑年界的學習與修　問題，因為目前祖國抗戰，固然亟需靑年幹部人才，而後方建設及建國事業，亦在在備要新的人才·我們不能僅以日常功課的成續及格而自滿，我們還要在這大時代中學習爭取民挨解放的學問，並且把自己修養成為支持國家社會事業的中　份子·這些學問與修養，祇有在一切實際的救亡與工作羣衆運動中才能獲得。我們靑年界再不應該固步自封了！再不應該苟且倫安了！沒有組國的猶太人的生活，我們應該引為警惕；而五四運動以來先烈先進們的艱苦奮鬥的精神，可為我們效法，集體的學習制度，如時事座談會演購會等，運動的修養方法，如參加實際的救亡工作，都是我們今日所應走的大路·「時勢不艱　，安用我輩為」？大家從更艱苦的奮鬥中前進吧！勝利的光輝？已在向我們招手！廖崇聖</p>

<h3>為爭取上海租界懸旗問題被迫來港　一群苦門的青年</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>他們痛恨為惡勢力威脅而悲觀的工作者</p>
<p>【報告！我今天捉到三個愛國份千！』</p>
<p>『報告！我今天捉到五個愛國扮于！』</p>
<p>『報告！某處又在開會，掛起中國旗來了！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>小英奸每日能够收入多少錢，就以　每日能捉到多少個愛國份子來做正比例。在×人威脅之下，上海法相界見不到天日，離了祖國懷抱的同胞，飲淚吞聲地渴望　還我自由！</p>
<p>是上月二十日的時候，上海市民為了實行精神練動員宣　而一律掛起國旗來，可歌可泣的事件遂接着發生·</p>
<p>掛國旗是×人與漢奸的眼中釘，公共租界幸而還得自由，法租界可就絕對不准·「不准」之後怎樣？方式雖然不同，而掛國旗的意態則一。</p>
<p>有些是採用「游擊式」的，　釆，我把國旗　起來，你去，我把國旗掛起來·有些是犧牲做生意的，把店門關住，國旗掛弁玻璃樹　，看看你敢不敢把牠打碎·有些是把國旗掛在上了鎖的門前，看看你去向誰干涉·……法租界依然是國旗的世界，這是國魂所寄托，這是憤　的象徵·</p>
<p>接着，撕毀國旗，蔑辱國旗，逮捕市民的悲劇公然在光天化日之下演出了！靑年學生與市民大衆忍無可忍，遂與魔手門爭，終於被捕入黑暗的鐵窗裏·全體市民憤激起來，一致罷工罷市了·</p>
<p>集體的行動使魔手不得不稍為讓步，原本只准國慶日掛中國旗的「條例』；終於將一年一日——國慶日——增加至八日——八個重要的紀念日了。雖然忍痛復工復市，仇恨的火種却廣大起來深化起來。被目為「妨　租界治安』的「恐怖份于』亦終於被迫離開學校，家庭。上海了·</p>
<p>上海流亡學生戰地服務團就是被迫離開上海，就是離開上海後在船上新組織的一個救亡工作隊·他們一行十一二人，四個是女性，全都是中學以上的學生，家庭環境　俗的亦很多·在上海的時候，各有所屬的救亡團體，為了參加縣旗的鬥爭，終於被迫而「卽日離境』，否則就要「坐監戰　」，因為須「卽日離境」，所以他們怱忽流亡，沒有充分的準備·因為他們生怕被家庭阻住，所以偷偷離開黑暗世界。家庭還不知道，衣服款項沒　帶出自不消說·每人身邊僅有匆促湊借的幾十元國幣，付了船費之後，已經「行　如洗』了·他們十三人經於日前抵港，現住在一間小學裏·生活呢？十三人一頓吃六角錢，不是吃乾麵包，就是用稀飯；是由一部份尚有東西可以當押的同志勉强支持的。他們在上海做工作什聲苦都吃過，今後還準備吃更艱辛的苦·他們為着痛恨一般被惡勢力所威脅而消極悲觀的工作者，所以他們的熱情像火般燃燒，意志像鐵般緊定·</p>
<p>現在他們正準備到桂林去，到了桂林，就有團體跟他們發生聯系，就可以找到工作的機會·但是，如何從香港到桂林呢？在香港逗留的時間生活如何維持呢？這就要等着本港教亡團　與熱心僑胞的援手了！</p>
<p>他們是在上海和×人漢奸鬥爭過的二羣；他們是坐過監牢，吃過苦楚的二羣；他們是不願為了惡魔的威脅而消極悲觀的一羣；他們是　脫「優裕生沽」而參加艱苦的民族解放門爭的一羣：他們這一羣需要我們的同情，帶助，與鼓勵，讓他們的活力得到發展，好好在苦難中生長起來·</p>

<h3>一團和氣</h3>
<p>— 歐陽予倩</p>
<p>……關於「黃花崗」的聯合演出……</p>
<p>在抗戰建國這個原則和目標之下，戲劇工作者應當一致精誠團結，完成其偉大的任務，這是誰也不能否認的。所以這一次「黃花崗』的聯合公演有極其重大的意義·但是聯合公演是最難辦的事，我以前在別處也曾參預過兩三次的聯合公演，沒有一次像這回那　的進行順利。</p>
<p>這次本來預定在三月廿九日上演，因為排練的問題，角色的問題，七演和銷票的問題，戲院接洽的問題種種，延長到如今——五月三日才在太平戲院演出。雖然時間延遲了，沒有應三月廿九日的景，不過這一次聯合公演的意義，並不單是限制在某一天行一個紀念的儀式，而是在宣揚革命的史跡，叫人知道國家締造的艱難，我們應當怎樣去追蹤先烈，而侏持其光榮於不墜。七十二烈十英　不死，『黃花崗』偉烈彪炳千秋，我們隨時隨地可以紀念，這個歷史劇絕對沒有時間性的限制。</p>
<p>這次的聯合公演，至少大部分打破了各自為政互不相謀的情狀，表現着留在香港的戲劇工作者同站在一條戰綫上。只要看參加的各劇團每一個團員都是在以十二分的熱誠，聯合成一個堅强的整體，看他們整的工作，顯出興奮和愉快。沒有嫉妬，沒有閒話，只有工作的向上。而且最可貴的是幷沒有任何人用任何方法和任何手段去組織，完全是自動地團結推進。本此精神，繼續努力，可以無堅不破·這是値得提出的。</p>
<p>這一次的公演，也經過不少的困難，單就服裝一層就費了很大的心力，其餘許多事也有無數的麻煩，可是沒有人事的糾紛，這顯得中國靑年們的大進步·</p>
<p>這个戲用的演員很多，有好幾個羣衆的場面，相當難於處理，加之這些羣衆演員又是由好幾個不同的非職業劇團來担任，所以更要困難一點。有些朋友以為至少第一天上演必定　雜小堪，可是出乎意料地　　　齊而活潑，這可見導演處理得不錯。最不可忽略的是飾羣衆的靑年同志們異常誠懇，十所以能得到極愉快的合作·尤其是那幾个由工友們組織的團體，他們不僅是時到按　而且劇詞熟得最早，這是多麼可以感奮的事啊！</p>
<p>正因為用人多而又不是經常演出之故，所有聯合公演應有的紛煩，的確令人躭心不少；可是在工作當中的確也訓練了自己·五月三日下午在太平戲院的舞樓上彩排的時候，大家是提心弔胆，一羣工作者忙得不可開交，舞台裝置者前夜通宵未睡，又一天沒有吃飯，把佈景趕起，服裝，化粧，燈光方面的人也絲毫沒有坐下的機會，導演們默默相對，也似乎沒有十分成功的把握；胡春冰先生除了排戲之外，連夜為特刊趕了許多文章，一付睡眠不足帶着靑色的臉，接連不斷地走過夾走過去，和許多人接頭·</p>
<p>幕開了，戲在一幕一幕進行，大家也一步一步把心上的石頭放下來，嚴肅而緊張的臉上漸漸露出笑容，台上的情緒和台下的情緒打成一片，高漲到頂點，觀衆靜默傾聽，　神　視的神情，和最後爆發來的掌　與附和着劇中人高叫的口號，更給了大家無限的勇氣·戲完之後，每個人都疲倦得甚麼似的：可是一樓事作成了，不知不覺感到一種陶醉的愉快。這種愉快，我到香港來道演過　多戲，覺得還是頭一次得到呢·愉快要從作中得來才是眞的！</p>
<p>「黃花崗」這個劇本當然也還有幾點小地方可以討論的，下次重演一定可以更整齊。至於所有的演員有的舞臺經驗很豐富，有的只上過一兩次臺，可是配合勻稱，便不願得那個角色特別好，那個角色特別壞，而且那些飾羣衆和黨人的演員，他們內在的情熱自然表露甚為動人，超過了他們技衛的修養，這是特別值得指出的。</p>
<p>這次「黃花崗』聯合公演，不僅證明了了香港戲劇界已經在同一的目的下統一起來了，同時證明了許多靑年已經打破了行帮門戶之見，得到了純潔的統一，這是多麼可以感動的事啊！</p>

<h3>活生生戲劇底紀錄·抗戰特辑</h3>
<p>— 白江</p>
<p>中國民族革命戰爭是一首千古不滅的偉大史詩，也是一　驚天動地的偉大戲劇·這史詩，這戲劇，是聚合了成千百萬的中國人民的生命，聚合了成千百萬戰士們的頭顱熱血，與不可毀滅的精神所寫成，任憑　有史以來多少詩人與戲劇家的理想與活動，不能比現時代，現階段，神聖戰　所表現的更偉大·因為這是使世界一羣狂暴的殺人劫略罪犯——法西期侵略者降服，使愛和平愛自由的多　人羣爭得生存，使新時代誕生的歷史鬥爭，這鬥爭就是偉大的詩之叙事，偉大的戲劇的演出·——抗戰特輯就是活生生的戲劇紀錄之一章·從前年，全面抗戰展開之前後開始，中國電影製片廠已開始活動，動員了雷影工作者在前方與後方，把一切眞實情形紀錄下來，這是一榕極其重要的工作，其重要性有如前方所需要的武器與糧食，它是精神的武器與糧食，输運去接濟我們國內外伺胞，與關心這個民族安危的國際　人。</p>
<p>抗戰特輯從一至五輯已陸續在港公映過了，每次都帶來極寶貴極　富的村料·現在，六輯亦到港公映了，材料也極豐富。此輯紀錄時間特長，自武漢撤退前以至於今日，　就是包含了從抗戰第一個陷段進展到第二個階段的交　時期，我們看過了第一至五輯的人，看過了六輯之後可以作一個　的比較·當最初數輯公映的時候，我們雖可以見戰七的英勇，人民之刻苦，但也看見無數的弱點；可是六輯卻表現出一種抗戰交替期中，飛速的進步，更使我們對於抗戰組國有新印象與新的期望·片中的秩序井然的武漢　鎭之撤退，人民協助　政當局之努力，軍　上有針畫，有把握之佈　等等，顯然興以前數輯所見不同，表示着明確的進步·一年前我們在第一輯裏］還看見化裝××汪精　在慷慨激昂裝腔作勢地扮演其志士，老革命黨的表情，發揮那不兌現，不負責任的言論，但是六輯裏，此種人物已不復見了，只有不屈不撓，堅持持久抗戰之蔣委員長及多數軍政領袖們在六輯南獄會議中，始終如一，竭盡忠誠，執行抗戰建國大計。此外還有後方民衆救　傷兵，及我軍優待　　，敎育俘虜等等情形·我們　然看見士兵及後方人民的痛苦，然六　裏所紀錄書的，民衆並不因此種痛苦而氣綏，反之，更願見人民敵　心之加强，與乎對　後勝利之堅信，當司粉粹漢好們，陰謀引人民痛苦之口實以為求和之根據·在全部材料中，雖有部份是遠在數月前攝影下來，在報道意義上似　太慢了些，此種情形，當然是因為武漢撤退時中國電影製片廠也同時西撤重慶，重新整理及剪輯，此聞擱若干時日，然片中材料之眞，與　富，當不减其價值與意義·</p>
<p>抗戰特輯精彩的一幕：廬山孤軍沉着作戰</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3>各界賑災聯會敦請　中救劇團義演　本月下旬將大規模演出</h3>
<p>中國救亡劇團，自準備出國作救亡宣傳，於去月到港後，因為他們過去在國內各地工作的努力，和成績的卓著，故歷受本港各文化團體，婦女團體等的熱烈歡迎，轟動一時。現在，全港各界賑濟華難民聯席會，因崇仰該團的戲劇藝術，為擴大宣傳及籌款賑濟傷兵難民起見，特議决敦請該團於出國前為該會作一次大規　之籌　義演，將在本月下旬在某大戲院作大規模的演出·現該團除巳積極排演各偉大抗戰名劇外，並已着手裝製宏偉的佈景和燈光。相信這次演出，其意義的重大，藝術的精鋉，佈景的偉大一，燈光的奇妙，將可打破任何劇團的演出紀錄·這次演出，除院租外，一切佈景演出費用，概由該團負祖，這更是本港戲劇界空前的有意義的偉舉！</p>
<h3>「黃花崗」史實的商討</h3>
<p>— 潘節菴</p>
<p>為了要使辛亥建國革命的前奏曲和促成者的「七十二烈士』線攻廣州督著的壯烈事蹟，給一般國民以深刻的和普遍的認識，去紀念黃花節；同時，又為了要籌集一點　子去撫卹抗戰陣亡將士的家屬，來作更有意義地紀念黃花節，香港賑聯會大會畢竟接納了全港話劇團體的提議，公演埋骨黃花崗頭那七十二位轟轟烈烈殉國的偉大歷史劇·</p>
<p>現在公演實現了，當作者對這偉大貢獻所憧着的成果，眞的能够一點一點的兌了現，這裏，我們自然有說不出的萬二分欣忭；同時，作者當日對這偉大史蹟的整埋與考實底幾點多慮，也不幸地證實了·</p>
<p>因為工作繁忙，連購讀劇本的空閒都沒有，祇有憑着相當信仰——經過二十多個劇作奢的工作，多　文化人的整理　檢討，在等候這空前的演出。</p>
<p>無欵地，這次偉大的演出，誠有如胡春冰先生說的，巳經『把一個難于把握，更難於處理的題材，組織成了有血有肉有靈魂，有現代的義意，能與目前政治相配合的劇本』。無論在藝術的本身上，抗戰的宣傳上，尤其在戰劇工作者的統一戰綫和自我敎育的效果上，它都已奠立了它相當的成果。可是，問題就在于這『難於把握，更難于處理』上來，作者在看到完場時，不期然地吁着氣，說了一句「難』！</p>
<p>關於劇旨中心力的集中，巳經盡其能事；至於事實的眞置性之固定，比較重要材料之去留，作者於此，卻有自己的一點意見，很想提出跟大家討論，可是因為時間，篇　和史實的搜尋，都不能容許，所以祇好先把比較易於更改的，向又屬於犖</p>
<p>大端的提出，同大家討論</p>
<p>這裏請就三個範圍說：溫生才，於行刺孚琦後，最好能够於旣走脫後而為一巡警所糾纏，由溫目動繳械交　被執，那一方旣符合當日溫烈士對那巡警說的：「大家都是中國人，不殺同胞！」的眞實事實，更足見溫烈士的果敢的偉大的自愛同族的精神·</p>
<p>第二第三縣裏。關於　同改期問題，據一般老同志說，陳銷波的主張是奸細，胡毅生的主張是過於持　，而陳炯明的卻是一種顧慮和拘牽，（那大抵是為着　議局方面關係）姚雨　的是明待，各有不同的心理，然而演出上固沒有一一表現出來，也沒有一點誰好誰　的暗示，自然，大家對陳鏡波是除外·第三，黃京强的被强制發出改期令後的「自殺』，在這裏，在演出的形態上看來，都是多餘之·舉固然，因為這自殺問題，曾經費過許多人；　巴金，茅盾等討論過，認為黃氏於自思對不起海外同志，對不起孫先生，惟有一死以謝；然而，我們當知，以黃氏的長江會黨　多年首領生活與資格，自殺一事根本不會在他們的腦海裏湧現出來，他之報香港統籌部之所謂一死，就是欲效史堅如。溫生才等之一人身拚的死法，所以，他於氣憤而又氣結之餘，想衝出去與李準一拚巳　，殊不必。並不應　上自殺念頭，而又轉念去拚呢。</p>
<p>（二）名稱和術語的運用</p>
<p>要找出這次上演的缺點，實在沒有什麼；不過，上述的　種細節，卻表現出很多缺點·事例很多不能記憶，祇把最重要的寫出來；序幕要，孚琦是滿員，而不是漢官，他是忠於他們的「滿』家和「滿」族，而溫生才卻大笑地罵　：「多殺一個漢奸，一個奴才，中國就可以少一條害蟲！』這胸最大的錯悮，就是，孚琦不是「漢』奸，所以溫的罵等於不知所謂。並且，孚琦之職，是將軍，稱做制軍，或制臺，無論下屬和什麼人，都叫他「大帥』；可是，固無論溫生才，甚至他的屬員「統帶」，竟稱他為一孚「將軍，他既不是姓「孚』，而做屬員（奴）的，對一個皇室的封疆大吏，誰敢直指其姓與名？第二幕林覺民之妻，在同志口中，竟稱為林太太，固然覺民的身份和名義之成問題，一就算是，革命黨人中，而竟同滿奴口吻，叫起太太，這未免有　那個！第三幕　克强同徐宗漢竟然談起「戀愛』，這不是同宋代人而找「康熙字典」看嗎？因為那時根本還沒有「戀愛』題名稱呢·至於那時國民黨，固然未改組，還是中華革命黨，總理　名稱未咸立（成于民十三國共聯合後），就是一般黨人，對孫中山先生，都祇呼『先生』，而不姓不名·淸宦口中，從不呼革命黨，而直名之以匪黨，或亂黨，這在張鳴岐的幕友說得最合。在淸官口中而說舉義為『起事』也小對，幕友審詢黨人時說的「造反」才最合式。這是其最重要的，其他小節不能多舉·</p>
<p>（三）服裝和化妝</p>
<p>這也是一件軍要事情。那裝扮非得真切不可——這裏最敎糊塗的就是張鳴岐的長鬍　了，據筆者所知和當時廣州親友所述說，張氏為淸末總督中之最年輕，大約當總督時為卅九歲，亥辛年，最多不過四十一二，那裏來如許二三寸長的「干忠思一的東西？而且，張如美男子，人說他有一艷脫的庶母，與張形影與共，那晚看他，他已快將就木了·第二，陳炯明在黨的行為總不足取，然而他的純樸，大家都總知道一二·他的在諮議局時代的藍布長袍，和反正後的灰布長袍，都可以代表他的級裝，　可是那晚陳氏竟除了穿上一件華貴的絲長衣外，還加上一件沒有的衣袖西關阿官的背心，這叫作者一看如果不是克强喚他炯明，眞是放組其不敢信那就是他了·</p>
<p>以上的略把我個人的意見寫出來，給大家討論，因為時間忽怱，如果大家甚歡的話，以後有空再談。</p>
<p>編者的話：　黃花崗的公演，促成了戲劇界堅強的合作，與觀者熱烈的共嗚。不過技術上的問題，我們也想　論。這是使話劇領域擴大所必需的。潘先生的大文，僅是一個討論的開端。我們除請黃花崗』的導演團諸先生負　解答外，更希望讀者熱烈地參加討論。</p>
<h3>七四一次的演出</h3>
<p>— 王瑩</p>
<p>第二天的晚間，徐州城仍舊沉浸在黑暗中，風沙一陣陣地打着我們住屋的窗子，玻璃全被彈片擊破了·</p>
<p>早晨我們寫了幾篇通訊，一篇是登在徐州民國日報的，內容述及我們以後採取什麼方式在鄉村戰地那些沒有舞台地方演劇，以及怎樣才能在廣大民衆間收到宣傳的效果。下午我們佈置了小禮堂；幕前　着　色小布　·舞台上排列着三架屛風，這便是我們舞台裝置的全部·</p>
<p>人越來越多了，把臨時小小的劇場塞滿了，沒有亮，觀衆們都在黑暗中候着開幕·</p>
<p>後台，在不寬的甬道上，擺着一張桌子，幾條長木凳，我們全體都擠在一堆，在　幌的燭光下，忙着化裝，每個人粗技大葉地用毛筆和鉛粉勾畫了角色·</p>
<p>『九一八以來』中兇惡得無　　的東隣（金山飾）</p>
<p>八點多鐘的時候，電燈亮了，節目開始·「諸位同志』，藍幕拉開了，掌聲和演講一同熱烈地進行着，我們說明了這一次到徐州來的意義，告訴了觀衆們我們要捨棄過去所走的戲劇的路，在抗戰中要　新開闢一新的道路——拿戲劇做宣傳的武器參加抗戰·最後我們說：『如果有警報，因為人太多了，請不要走到劇場外面去，我們全體坐在台上，陪着諸位談話，講故事。』</p>
<p>幕閉上了又拉開。</p>
<p>活報劇『保衛祖國』·</p>
<p>序幕，象　劇『九一八以來』：在東北，一個和平而快樂的家庭，一家老小正在溶溶洩洩地過活，一天忽然闖進了一個滿口親善共存共榮的東鄰，硬把大女兒（東三省）給槍去了，正當全家悲憤的時候，那矮而兇惡的隣居，貪得無　接着又把二女兒（熱河）搶去了；這時父親和兒子感到和平是任人宰割，决心自衛，他要是再來，我一定把他打出去！父親悲憤地說，結果那隣居來搶三女兒（平津）的時候，全家團結，一致抵抗，終於將東隣趕出這和平的家庭了。閉幕時，全場觀衆大喊：澈底驅逐××出中國境！</p>
<p>第一幕：「八一三』前夜，上海各界代表和俞鴻鈞市長在市府開會，每個代表都表明了抵抗的决心，「我們一切都準備好了』他們說。時鍾止指三點五十分，離最後時間抵差十分鐘；電鈴響了，是××的最後限時答覆，當市長拿電話筒預備講話時，慕後發出了一個共同吼聲：不屈服！不屈服—觀衆席上有我們的同志在嚮應着，結果觀衆們亦跟着喊了：不屈服，不屈服！　，上台下吼成了一片，俞市長對着電話筒簡單而有力地說：我們四點鐘會給你答覆的。</p>
<p>第二幕；上海的八字橋，靑天白日旗威嚴地在戰壕前飄勤，弟兄們靜靜地描準，官長看着手鏢，三點五十六分，五十七分……一分一分數過去，到了四點，一聲巨響，火花爆發了，弟兄們勇敢地衝出戰壕，衛鋒號悲壯地　着。</p>
<p>第三幕：在閉着的藍幕前，置一個揚聲器；先報告電台的名稱，然後將最高領袖的廬山宣言，用廣播的形式激昂地向觀衆放送了·場子裏十分　靜，觀衆的臉上都充滿了悲憤的情緒·</p>
<p>附註：扮演大女兒二女兒三女兒的演員，在背上縫一塊白布寫着——東三省——　　——津——等字樣，象徵着這些地方，但未被東隣槍走的時候，避免讓觀象看見。　（二續，未完）</p>
<h3>「黃花崗」公演後</h3>
<p>— 司從慧敏</p>
<p>……祝許多失敗中的偉大成功……</p>
<p>劇</p>
<p>假使從純技衛至上或藝衛至上主義出發，也許可以判斷此次『黃花崗』的公演是失敗了，因為當中有着許多劇本上，表演上的缺點還未加洗練；不過，我們亦可以從許多失敗之中看到了偉大的成功：我們可以見觀衆情緒之激昂，台上與台下一致的呼應，把「黃花崗」所要求的效果都極其充份地獲得了·這一次『黃花崗」的公演，在港中固然是建立了前所未有的戰劇運動之道標；至於觀衆情緒被感動之深，在香港也是空前的了。因為我會為此種　　的感　熱流所激動觀後使我亦和觀衆一樣的激動到忘記了演出上的缺點，使我深深地對於工作同志之努力，肅然起敬。</p>
<p>這次公演，包括全港個戲劇團體，參加前後台工作人員達三百餘之多，不但在香港是空前，在中國　運　史中亦不可多見，記得前年七七事變發生之後·滬上劇作家們也會在極迅　地柒體創作了保衛置溝僑劇本，並於「八一三」之前夕，發動全滬劇人聯合公演，這事情在當時劇這上算是一個很大刺激·怎知道在二十餘月後之今日，從前曾被稱為戰劇不毛　的港港，同樣偉大的戲劇界的刺激也　　起來了·照一般看起來，集合了許多　　，許多個人的工作是有力量有效能的；但是另一方面的說法，　　越多，人越多，是　容易使工作紊亂的，公演之前，我會經引以為此次工作的同志們　心　，別說事前，排演及其他種種的佈　　術，　從上場人數那　多·出演時間又是那麼畏，這上演期中前後台的工作已經是够麻煩了·可是事實證明了我個人的杞憂，上演使我們看出非常之有秩序，有計劃的進行着，人物場與變換佈景等工作都很顧利，除第三幕至第四幕換景時間稍長外，其餘最快為十分鐘，最多不過十五分鏡，以不十分善完的設備之限制，這已經是很滿意的。</p>
<p>全部上演時間，自八時十五分起至十二時止，共三個半多鐘頭，以四幕六場，而台詞又相當多的劇本，這演出時間是很適當的·這表示此次演出，在工作上能得到集團工作之優點，而排除前面所舉出的缺點，遍應該向參加此次工作諸君，特別應該向前後　工作者致深深的敬意！</p>
<p>據第一天所見，其中尚有許多缺點，不過後兩天當應該有若干改善·現在單就第一天的情形，作一個簡略的意見，願劇人同志們加以指正和補充：</p>
<p>序幕，在全劇中是比較排演得純熟的，佈景燈光還好，可惜因舞台地位不深，天幕距　太近，襯景與台前的燈光不能適度的安排，兩側佈景對于演員演出阻碍·演員以飾衛軍統帶的怒潮較佳，其餘如飾黃俠毅的洗鋒，飾路人乙的莫言也很努力·儀仗兵與衛軍等角色太隨便，有點　　戲台上的「跑龍套』角色之出現，對於演出上是一個極大的缺點，而且給戲劇效果破壞，全劇　幕中，其中飾羣衆與此類　色的演員，犯　同樣的缺點的很多；這種情形，或者由於分配角色或排演時的忽略，或奢是演員演本身對於演劇集體活動之觀念上的謬誤所致。在舊時代的戲劇中，常常集中於某個人的演技上，而以其他角色作陪襯；但是新的戲劇這一點　誤是不能保留的·舞台上每一件東西，每一個出現的人物，無論他在舞台七佔的位置怎樣，時間多少，那是與全演出有極深切的關連，如果忽略了部份，也就等於忽略了全部，這是極普通而又易犯的　據·</p>
<p>溫生才的黃宗保很努力，不過表現這一個紅花　上的民族英雄，『在性格上好　不很適當·溫生才一出場，一見是一個兇惡得有點不近人性的漢于，如出場與路人乙相撞，這一點可以看到；如果要表現一個因受了極度的逼害，極度的刺激以至於性格上有失常態的表現時，那也不過是若干程度的暴燥，倔強，憤悶而已；然而像溫生才那樣的人，一種警良的　俠心是必然要表現出來的，這一點沒有做到，也許是劇本上的關係吧，暗殺及被捕一場是失敗了，溫生才與衛軍的節殺是那麼兒戲的，極緊張的一瞬間觀衆報以笑聲，加之行刺時沒有好好地利用聲嚮效果，這都是致失敗之要因·</p>
<p>第一幕人物的排佈與舞台活動很適宜·後半幕的速度却沒有排得適當·演員如飾喻培倫的黃凝霖，飾姚雨平的王鏗，飾方聲同的徐國嶼，飾黃克强的盧敦都很好，各人的性格也表現得相當明晰。飾林覺民的李晨風卻稍差·像林覺民那富於熱情而又有機智的人，在全部表演中覺得感情不够，特別是林太太出門後，忍痛訴述往事一節，沒有表現出年靑人的熱力，和理智與感情的鬥爭。淸官搜查一場的恐怖空氣不够，室內黨人的動靜很牽强，宗漢開門官長入室搜索的一息間，室內人牧毫無驚　的反應·劇本上佈置下的一個驚險關建，洩露黨員名單這一點，在視覺化與時間的操縱上沒有做好·</p>
<p>第二　　景地位很好，可惜太欠富麗，當然是以經濟條件的限制，全幕的事件交替不顯明，緊張程序沒有敵黨部屬，是最大的缺點前節婢女戲弄聽差甲的一場沒有排好，所以成了累贅，而且也沒有得到預期的效果·應伯聲入場報告以後，在劇的調子發展上，應該是急轉地增加其速度，可是因為演員動作的緩慢，台詞不十分熟讀　原因，防窖很大·飾張鳴歧的張熾孫，動作不够　快，台詞亦不甚流暢；飾張妾的鄧竹筠表演欠自然，許多動作過於流俗化。一向在中藝飾演重要角色之姜明與　馬，邱星海，等，在這一務中，只飾極不重要之男役等角色，不以職業劇團之地位關係，打破壓來的舊見，這種態度，這種工作精神，是非常值得贊美的·</p>
<p>第三幕，燎光的變換及佈置，為全劇中最佳·人物位置與舞台活動還算適宜。開場時，暗室中人物的動作與台詞的聲調，沒有好好地使與舞台空氣配合·演出者與第一幕同樣的顯得很努力·這一幕在劇的調子發展上，應該是漸次加速與加高，一直到到爭論改期，遲疑未决之短時　的劇的休止之一剎郎間為止，導演者大該有獲得這個效果的企圖，不過也為那勁作與台詞之不熟讀關係而失敗了·黃克强在矛盾中宣怖了改期而後來又反梅的一場，其中寫克强內心的苦痛，失意，衝動等等，在視覺的效果上頗感不足·飾徐宗漢的區愛，在當中向克强說服一場的表演上，態度不够嚴正，似乎也缺乏眞實的感情。這一幕的終結到很好的效果，可惜演員的聲調不够堅强，沒有把台詞與觀衆情緒一致的提高·</p>
<p>第四幕　演得較差，大部份是劇本上的關係，記得去年在廣州公演所看到的缺點，現在還留存着，特別是後面攻督署的部份。簡直大紊亂了，觀衆的情緒未被掀起，反而冷落，有若干地方因為太兒戲而令觀衆哄堂大笑了，此外各方面的缺點亦多，審陳更新與饒國英一場舞台空氣太缺乏恐怖的壓力；張鳴歧審問時不該帶着笑容·衛兵噴水使饒淸醒，絕對避免，這會使親衆發生反效果的笑聲；張鳴歧退堂時琅　情形的表演太誇張；接着士兵談革命黨一場中斷了緊張的空氣，黨人經殺入大堂一場不够熱烈；台詞，聲響效果，動作等，沒有做到有機的錯綜；羣衆演員的地位與動作沒有配置　宜，而且人數太少；這都是缺點，使第四　損失了很大的戲劇迫力·</p>
<p>尾聲當然是全劇决勝　據了，特刊是鍾啟南的演說者，戰士與觀衆靑年的演講，一字一句激動了觀衆的情緒；飾演者以最熱烈的眞實感情，與觀衆情緒相呼應。這一幕可說是全勝了，是空前的香港劇　的全勝、</p>
<p>以上全　個人的淺見，所論列的也不過是極小部份，或有不當的地方，希望　人諸君加以指正和補充。</p>
<p>總之，「黃花崗」上演的　是在許多失敗中的偉大咸功，願留港劇人，愛惜這實貴經壓，改善其缺點，使此次大規機，大團結的公演，健實地成為戲劇運動進程上的道！</p>

<p>西洋會陣　、失却大告山奴及比路度、對于攻守力量、類有影響、然後起者皆有進步、戰來頗勁、于首次兩局、尚能興友碑分庭抗　、以比三打就千局、此後因三數新手、綁驗缺乏、遂被友碑　足先登、扶搖直上、友碑卒以八比四得勝、</p>
<p>友碑為去屆義勇軍之化身、今年得友碑酒廠之資助、配備完善、服裝整齊、打來分外存勁、同時得十餘年經騐之T安納充任一壘、昨戰對方　球員死于其手下者、不知凡幾、于最後三局、守壘尤牢、將來華隊遇之、宜加注意、</p>
<p>西洋會共得安打十次、本有得分機會、可惜錯誤達至六次之多、應勝而不能勝、反而令到跑壘員出局、實為致　之主因、友啤得安打八次、錯誤三次、比率較西洋會為佳、然錯誤總三次之多、亦非　旅之好現象也。茲將　方名單績分錄下、</p>

<h3>友誼足球賽　南華殺走洋水兵　六比三演出頗寫意</h3>
<p>南華足球隊出發南征在　、為加緊練習計、於昨日下午四時半、一班人馬開往加路連山球場、與英艦蔑威號足球隊、一較高下、</p>
<p>昨南華諸將、皆興高彩烈、　力同心、洋水兵雖欲頑抗、但終不能撼動我軍分毫、結果南華以六比三之戰續、大奏凱歌、</p>
<p>戰時、南華初以鍾勇森、林德譜、謝錦　諸將登場、因聯絡渙散、無甚精彩可見、除于開球七分鐘、水益乘鍾葉妙傳、打一進球後、卽再無收獲、此胥由無諒解之合拍、有以致之、</p>
<p>昨勇森雖竭力表演、惟因久疏練習、脚頭欠準、金海則差强人意、北華雖勇、但巳不若當年之八面威風、中後兩衛、僅屬平平、兆怔則頗令人滿意也、</p>
<p>至下半場時、易以英　、根保、柏偉登場後、情勞頗變、進則必克、退則固若金湯、戰情見較上半場為可觀、首由英祺乘水益踢角球之便、頭頂入網、巳而海軍喜沙路頓、于反攻中、在要地打進一　、眨眼間、左前衛加手拔、策馬來犯、再奪囘一球、以二比二追成平局</p>
<p>再　有頃、水益得機又射進一球、金海隨亦兩次錦上添花、乃再造穩勝之局、斯時洋水兵似不甘損失、大舉來攻、卒由高路斯遠射、咽格倫、　沙路頓乘機將球衛進網內五比三南華仍佔優勢、戰至行將完場時、英　乘水益高傳、再進一個、乃以六比三獲勝、兩　出戰球員如后</p>

<h3>前中華兩足球名將　在蘭州殉職　天壯士符家與與鵬飛</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】符家興與葉鵬飛這兩個名兒、許多足球迷還不會忘記、他倆在六七年前、考入廣凍航空學校練習飛行、畢業後、卽在空電服務、</p>
<p>當中華體育會足球隊漸趨衰落時代、他倆因與陳　和徐亞輝等同學關係、聯同投入中華旗下、在本港足球場上已流過不少血汗、</p>
<p>那時廣州的足球運動、也蓬勃而興、海軍、空軍、警察三隊、鼎足稱雄、符葉等就是當時空軍隊中的檯注、</p>
<p>自抗戰軍與、符葉二人奉命調往昆明受調、度着刻苦勤勞的生活、他倆是熱血靑年、志切報國、以為受訓後、便得參加作戰、駕神魔而殺×、一展其凌雲壯志、</p>
<p>怎曉得、壯志未　身先死、噩耗傳來、令人悲悼、符　二人於上月某日竟在蘭州同時殉職了、</p>
<p>他倆殉職原因、乃同一起駕機練習飛行、不知怎地該機出了事、從高空跌下來、於是這兩位英勇有為的飛天壯士、很不幸地與該機同歸於盡了、（東郎）</p>

<p>游擊隊在敵人後方——黎冰鴻作</p>
<p>游擊三代——丁聰作</p>
<h3>由漫畫說起</h3>
<p>— 李凡夫</p>
<p>抗戰巳轉入第二階段，我們漫畫工作者所負的責任，可說是一天比一天的重。蔣委員長曾暗示我們，說二期抗戰，思想戰重于軍事戰。故文化工作的擴大與加緊，今後卻是必然的途徑的！</p>
<p>在加緊文化工作以加强思想戰的今日，漫畫的需求必將愈切：中國過去在敎育上未能普及，故文盲很多！文字的宣傳，會感覺相常困難。要解决這困難，漫畫就有這個力量；要激發民衆的抗戰情緒，要增强民衆的必勝信念，要發揚民挨精神，要提高民埃意識，漫畫都能在文字宣傳定不通的地方去走。它能深入民間，它能使文盲也會感到愛好與領略其意義。</p>
<p>中國抗戰了廿一個月，×人是朝着墳墓裏走，我們却是朝着光明的道路定，最後勝利，是絕對有把握的，雖然在過去二十個月中，我們犧性了不少熱血頭顏，放棄了不少城鎭都市，但×愈深入，他的泥足就愈深，我們目前的艱鉅，正是將來的收穫—而這艱鉅，我們在抗戰開始時早已知道，我們絕不會為了目前的艱鉅。而稍變其已定的一貢的抗戰計劃，只有喪心病狂，怯懦不振的人才曾在這最後勝利在望的當中，發出什麼和平論調，正因為有人發出什麼和平論調，我們的責任就愈重。所以在這個生死存亡絕續的關頭，我們漫畫工作者，在這動蕩的大時代中，只有更大的努力；努力！努力！直至把日本的法西斯軍隊趕出了中國領土！</p>
<p>流亡——麥非作</p>
<h3>學習漫畫家烈墨克吧！</h3>
<p>— 黃鼎</p>
<p>話又說囘到歐戰的時候，當　土坦尼亞號一　並沒有武裝設備的比利時商船，在地中海被德意志的潛水艇擊沉了，沿上數百個準備載到安穩地帶的孩子，便這樣地慘死在侵略者的手裏，他們看不見自已的父母，看不見自己心愛的玩具，他們靜靜地躺在一艘撈屍船的甲板上，大大小，小的都有，由　屏的水手把他們的身體分列兩旁，等候傷心的人們來領回自已疼愛的兒女，　是一幅怎樣悽　的　　，反侵略的　晝家墨克烈（Raemackers）氏誠　地描好這一幅漫畫，使每一個人看見受到感動，使有孩子的人們看見流淚。</p>
<p>烈畢克對於當時被德軍侵略的比利時是非常同情的，但他不過是一個寂寂無聞的荷蘭產的漫畫家吧。他為了憎惡　武戰爭，痛　侵略者的舉行，他把他愛護人類的熱情表現在自己的作品上，當他不朽的漫畫一張一張地印載在荷蘭國內的新聞紙上，漫畫反侵略的宣傳戰效能，便很快的深入全世界正義公道的人們的眼睛　和心坎中，因之主持公道的國家的報　和雜誌，在最短的期間內來轉載這位偉大漫畫工作者的畫稿，烈墨克的名字便傳遍歐美了，而且得到最崇高的　詞。泰晤士報頌之為『無論在歐洲或美洲，他可以算得是最偉大的戰爭書家』。這說得很　在。</p>
<p>烈墨克的成就，完全出於他個人高潔的感情，和正義的良心。同時他也有特殊熟練的繪畫技巧，他是非常的忠實，對事物的形態毫不苟且，他的漫畫，每一張都有他的靈魂，無論年老年幼的人看見了都受着感動。他的手法是極忠實而樸繁的表現。他所描寫德國軍隊當時在比利時的暴行，完全是一本極逼眞的實錄。英國法庭上證人，對他出版的魯集會這樣宣誓說：『誠實，完全是誠實，除誠實之外便無別物』。從這句說，便可以看出烈墨克對編畫的態度。</p>
<p>他不只在正義的人們的腦海中存有不可麼滅的印象。他還使那些被調刺者深感不安，他會寫過一幅名為『無辜的殘殺』的漫畫，書面描出許多被德軍殘殺的小兒婦女的鬼魂，在模糊的煙幕中出現，正包圍着一個　武者的主犯威廉皇帝，使他聽見正義呼聲的威廉第二感到惶慄·這張漫畫使威廉看到認為最大恥辱，他只得以六千元的貴格來通緝烈克墨作為報復的手段，但烈墨克當時已遷到倫敦居住了。</p>
<p>烈墨克的偉大值得在歐戰史上佔一巨面，他崇高的藝衛性靈，正使我們深深的敬仰！他為人類正義而鬥爭的精神，正是我們應學習的！</p>
<p>中國現在正被××的侵略者施×的時候，中國日前所受的痛苦，恐怕不會少過歐戰的比利時所受的慘酷。今日壓迫中國的侵略者，相信一定　歐戰時的德國更兇暴呢！中國民埃已全體起來抵抗了。不過目前正缺少了一個如烈墨克的人，忠實地記　侵略者的×狀。</p>
<p>中國的漫畫家們！你是願做一個烈墨克嗎？</p>
<h3>加強智慧戰的力量</h3>
<p>— 林琛</p>
<p>抗戰才是出路——陳煙橋作</p>
<p>軍事家的證據，一場戰爭的决定是在軍備，金錢，兵員，三個條件，而控　着整個戰爭的士氣，其力量更超乎這一者之上，假使你的軍備完固，金錢富有，兵員充足，而映少了戰爭的士氣，那你一定是這場戰爭的　牲者了，所以有人說：智慧戰實際上比較物質戰還要重要。</p>
<p>從歷史上的戰爭來看，因智慧戰而成功的，不可勝數，蘇俄十月革命的成功，凱末爾的再造土爾其，都是很好的例于，只要我們施用得適當，一管毛筆，比一桿　也許還要厲害。</p>
<p>在目前的中國，外須要國際理解，內須要民衆領悟，圖畫宣傳，是比文字宣傳，更有效。更深刻，「漫畫』於是成為智慧戰中的强有力的哨兵了。抗戰以來，漫晝工作者，已一致把筆尖注視到侵略者的內臟，明顯的叙述，坦白的暴露，使慣於浩謠欺騙的×人，狼狽異常，可是漫晝運動，或許是陌生一點，還未獲得全體同胞的諒解，碍於客觀的環境，這個運動進展得非常　緩，這是漫畫工作者放棄他們的任務嗎？不，這純然是環境不容許漫畫這一部門，獨立生長起來，使漫畫運動不得不走曲線發展。</p>
<p>這次現代中國漫畫展覽會，作品雖然不多，但它可以將今日的中國漫畫運動的雛型，給一般未了解的人們得進一步認識，使他們明白了漫畫遝動的任務，加以正確的批評，和同情的培植，那中國的漫　運動，便得按步就班，順利地發展。</p>
<p>為了充實抗戰的能力，不得不健全智慧職的陣容，為了健全智慧戰的陣容，我們不得不積栩進行漫畫運動，這次展覽，不過是工作的開始；各界同志，能給我們一點正確的指導，以加强智　戰的力量，這是我們的希望。林琛</p>

        <h1>1939.05.07</h1>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Responsibility in Law for His Words and Actions</h3>
<p>— Chu Fei</p>
<p>Note: Wang Jingwei, formerly the Vice President of the Kuomintang, Vice Chairman of the Central Political Committee, Deputy Speaker of the Supreme National Defense Council, and Speaker of the National Political Council, suddenly held a dissenting opinion against the established national policy of unity and resolute resistance to the insults, deserted his post without authorization, issued a farewell telegram, and echoed the statement of Konoe Fumimaro, causing an uproar throughout the country and a chorus of verbal and written condemnations, leaving Wang Jingwei utterly discredited. However, he stubbornly clung to his views and published the article "Giving an Example" in his controlled ×××× newspaper, ××××××××××××, creating a great uproar and becoming the target of public criticism. As a lawyer, I live by the law and base my arguments on facts and evidence. Therefore, regarding the secret agreement between him and Hiranuma, as reported by the Chongqing Dagongbao, the translator obtained information. Other evidence includes the spreading of his infamous telegram by airplane, the Nanjing puppet "Great People's Association" acting as a broadcasting station, the Jiaxing puppet "Great People's Association" responding with a telegram, the puppet "East Asia Anti-Communist Association" sending a telegram of support, and especially the continuous praise and flattery from a certain puppet newspaper. In criminal cases, the principle of discovering the truth is adopted, so concerning Wang Jingwei's actions.</p>
<p>What is discussed here is that Wang Jingwei, holding important positions in the Party and the state, at this critical time of national crisis, abandoned his post and fled the country to show his non-cooperation with the government. This is an act that should be held accountable under Article 2, Section 2 of the Public Servants Disciplinary Act, which concerns "neglecting duties or other acts of dereliction of duty."</p>
<p>According to general practice, the minority obeys the majority, and once a vote is passed, there is no room for opposition except for reconsideration. Although the rules of procedure for the Supreme National Defense Council and the National Political Council have not been seen and cannot be cited, according to the principles of popular sovereignty, they should not deviate from this principle. The national policy of resistance was decided by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the National Political Council repeatedly issued declarations of support. Wang Jingwei, as Deputy Speaker of the Supreme National Defense Council and Speaker of the National Political Council, could have expressed his confident views within the meetings if he believed they were beneficial to the country. However, since his views were not adopted by the majority, no matter how bright and righteous his views were, and if there was no background support, he could only sacrifice his own views and obey the consensus, in accordance with the general rules of the meeting. However, he rashly sent telegrams outside the meeting to oppose the publicly decided case, which is extremely contrary to the spirit of democratic politics. This is another responsibility he should bear under the parliamentary procedure.</p>
<p>Between countries, and between governments and the people, there are indeed confidential matters that should be kept secret. Although the proceedings of the 54th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council did not concern national defense plans, they were sufficient to show the government's diplomatic strategies, and there is no doubt that they should be kept secret. Wang Jingwei also admitted that these facts, for the sake of national interests, needed to be strictly kept secret, but he claimed that "past facts can be made public as an example." Then, which facts are not in the past? Wang Jingwei once served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he knew many facts related to foreign affairs, which are all in the past, but can they all be made public? How absurd! This is another responsibility he should bear under Article 132 of the Criminal Law, which concerns "leaking confidential documents or information other than those related to the national defense of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Moreover, freedom of speech and action, without adhering to party discipline, is especially a responsibility to be borne from the party's standpoint, which goes without saying. As for what Wang Jingwei mentioned in the original text of "Giving an Example" about what Chairman Chiang said to the German ambassador at the time, it clearly stated that "there is no trust in Japan" and that there was a statement "proposing that Germany first encourage Japan to stop the war." This indicates that there was no definite recognition of the points raised by the German ambassador, and the citation is obviously a distortion of the meaning. Since it is not related to legal arguments, it is not within the scope of this discussion, and I will not elaborate on it here.</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From April 30th to May 6th, 1939</p>
<p>Entering a tragic and heroic May of battle!</p>
<p>The evolution of current events in the world and China further increases our courage and determination to advance the tragic and heroic battle.</p>
<p>After entering May, the battle on the two fronts began with small fluctuations and changes. On the side of democratic and peaceful countries, the British authorities' policies have not yet shown positive performance, affecting the slow progress of the anti-aggression front. The Soviet Union finally took decisive action. War? Peace? More obvious performances will come soon!</p>
<p>On the side of the aggressor countries, new conspiracies are underway. The leaders of Germany, Italy, and Japan have been meeting for a whole week, and it has not yet ended! However, Japan, the aggressor in the East, has more clearly started to ××××××××××××, and has launched more inhuman bombings and ×× against China. On the one hand, this proves its desperate "jumping over the wall" situation, and on the other hand, it has increased the hatred of all righteous people towards it.</p>
<p>(1) Britain's Anti-Aggression Stance</p>
<p>The "anti-aggression group" under the leadership of the British capitalist government still has considerable progress, such as the continued negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, the continued progress of British-French cooperation, the regular visits of the British King and Queen to Canada and the United States, and even the news of the simultaneous organization of a "Thirteen-Nation Anti-Aggression Grand Alliance" based on the five countries of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Turkey (London电 from Havas News Agency). However, all of these have not fully demonstrated that the British government has already decided to abandon its compromising policy in practice. Moreover, in reality, the British government still has a kind of fantasy, attempting to use this "anti-aggression Grand Alliance" posture to divide the aggressive groups of Japan, Germany, and Italy, to revive the Four-Power Group, to encourage Germany to move eastward, and to raise the already broken anti-Soviet banner again. Therefore, newspapers representing the British government have spread the news that Hitler's speech contained "room for peace," and the news that Japan has decided not to participate in the German-Italian military alliance. However, in negotiations on cooperation with the Soviet Union, they insisted on their opposition to the collective security system, insisting that the anti-aggression line would never include the Far East. This behavior is obviously hindering the advancement of the anti-aggression front, and has once again helped Germany, giving it an opportunity to bargain, and in fact has increased the crisis of world peace!</p>
<p>(2) Activities of the German and Italian Leaders</p>
<p>The unrealistic and incomplete stance of the "anti-aggression group" actually gives the fascist aggressors an opportunity to take advantage of, and helps them to calmly prepare for further aggressive challenges.</p>
<p>The first is the staff meeting held by the army authorities of Germany and Italy. The Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Brauchitsch, led many officers and arrived in Rome on April 29th, where he met with Mussolini and held important talks with the Italian army authorities. On April 30th and May 1st, he again had lengthy discussions with Mussolini and the Spanish military delegation, and flew to Libya on the 1st. Second, Goering, the German Minister of Aviation, arrived in Rome on the evening of May 4th by special train, and immediately held talks with the Italian leadership. Third, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and his wife, accompanied by the Deputy Minister and other important foreign affairs figures, took a fast train to Italy on the evening of the 4th, and began talks with the Italian Foreign Minister on the afternoon of the 5th regarding important issues such as dealing with Poland and the status of Yugoslavia. Fourth, Germany continues to compete for the satellite states of the democratic countries, first by wooing the Nordic countries, so that the countries maintain "neutrality" in wartime. The official announcement on May 4th was that a non-aggression treaty had been concluded with Latvia, and now it is proceeding with activities with Estonia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Fifth, Germany and Italy continue to expand their military forces. Germany is conducting the construction of six new-style armored cruisers and other projects. Italy, due to the heavy military losses suffered in Spain, is striving to strengthen its military strength. On the 29th, the Italian cabinet passed a bill to enhance the army, allocating 500 million lire to adjust the army, and at the same time intensifying the training of air vehicles and expanding the strength of the air force. This shows that relaxing on the aggressors actually increases the threat to democracy and peace!</p>
<p>(3) Implementation of Japan's New Strategy</p>
<p>Seeing through the existing defects in the anti-aggression movement. Seeing through the exploitable points in the current policies of the democratic countries, especially Britain. Japan, the aggressor in the Far East, has become more cunning and rampant in implementing its new strategy.</p>
<p>Japan and the leaders of Germany and Italy have been in constant contact over the past week. The fact that the authorities in Berlin denied on May 4th that "Germany, Italy, and Japan are conducting military negotiations" can be used to prove the opposite. The Japanese leadership has also held continuous meetings over the past week and decided on the so-called policy towards Europe, outwardly declaring: "Regarding the conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, Japan has its own independent foreign policy, but Japan does not want to offend democratic and totalitarian countries, but wants to maintain and promote friendly relations with all countries in the world." This clearly shows that they have seen through the compromising nature that still exists in the current foreign policies of the democratic countries, especially the British government, and are carrying out their cunning tactics of enticement.</p>
<p>But at the same time, first, Japan has begun to put pressure on the Shanghai Concession. Although the Concession authorities are courageously succumbing, such as repeatedly exerting pressure on Chinese-language newspapers, Japan still insists on exclusively controlling the Concession's power. Second, Japan has again begun to carry out brutal ××× indiscriminate bombings of major cities in China and South China, especially when Ambassador Zhang Ying was in Chongqing consulting with our central government to promote Chinese-British cooperation. On May 3rd and 4th, they carried out large-scale bombings of Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Japanese aggressors are implementing enticement on the one hand and implementing threats on the other. The fundamental reason is that they have lost their grasp on victory in the war of aggression against China. Moreover, under our firm and united resistance, Japan is getting deeper and deeper in the quagmire. Therefore, they are trying to use the bait of "friendship" to prevent Britain from supporting the Soviet Union and aiding China; at the same time, they want to use the tough means of completely destroying British interests in China and South China to help with the "enticement strategy," ×× Britain ××. The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Aoi, had already warned Britain on April 27th, urging it to abandon its policy of aiding China. The British Foreign Secretary said: "Britain is not pursuing this policy, so there is no need to change the current policy towards China." This is diplomatic rhetoric that pleases both sides, but it can be regarded as a blow to the traitors who serve the × people? However, this is so insufficient!</p>
<p>(4) Important Declaration of the Communist International</p>
<p>At this time of extreme danger in the international situation, it is even more necessary to point out the disasters of some democratic and peaceful countries continuing their policy of compromise. It is even more necessary to point out the fact that fascist aggressors not only threaten small countries but also have their knives aimed at all people who demand democracy, freedom, and peace in the world! It is especially necessary to point out the urgent tasks of all mankind, especially the working masses, in the current struggle on the two fronts.</p>
<p>On May 1st, the great international Labor Day, the Communist International issued an important declaration that has a decisive force on the fate of the world. This declaration called on the workers of Britain, the United States, and France, and all anti-fascist and anti-aggression fighters, to unite and impose economic, military, and political sanctions on the fascist aggressors. This declaration also solemnly called on the working masses of the world to help China, who are bravely resisting aggression, and to strive to liberate Czechoslovakia, Albania, Spain, and Abyssinia.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, May 1st was the most enthusiastic day in the world. Grand celebrations were held throughout the country, with demonstrations against fascists and aggressors. A grand review was held in Moscow's Red Square, and large exercises were held in Minsk and Kiev. The Red Army and the laborers joined hands with the vast collective farm peasants and socialist intellectuals. Everywhere, roars of "Anti-Fascism, Anti-Aggression" were issued, shouting the slogans of "Aid China, Liberate the Oppressed Nations." This roar and slogan will not only inspire the working masses, forward-thinking people, and the people of democratic and peaceful countries all over the world, but will also arouse all the masses who are currently oppressed by the fascist aggressors in their own countries and their colonies.</p>
<p>The consolidation and expansion of the united front of the working masses of the world, and the advancement of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement by this united front, will be the main force to stop the Second Imperialist War that has already broken out! But everyone must know that it is time to rise up, not wait!</p>
<p>(5) The Soviet Union Takes Positive Action</p>
<p>This week, the Soviet Union took positive and decisive action.</p>
<p>First, the Soviet Union is working hard to organize the collective security of the Black Sea countries to replace the weak British and French unilateral guarantee to Turkey. (One-day Central News Agency Tokyo Power. Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin discussed with the Turkish authorities the establishment of cooperation between the Black Sea countries and Britain and France. This plan stipulates that the Dardanelles Strait will be opened in wartime, allowing warships of anti-aggression countries to pass.)</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet held large-scale exercises on the southeastern Turkish coast of the Black Sea, which successfully concluded on May 1st. Fleet Commander Oktyabrsky expressed his complete satisfaction with the fleet's combat capabilities, believing that at a time when German forces are invading the Black Sea, the Soviet fleet is sufficient to cope with all emergencies.</p>
<p>Third, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland has become closer, and Poland has also dared to start insisting on a tough attitude to deal with Germany's gradual approach. On May 5th, Polish Foreign Minister Beck also delivered a reply to Germany amid worldwide attention.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Soviet Union replaced Litvinov with People's Commissar Molotov as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. This move can be said to be a serious lesson for the two-faced policies of Britain and France, and the rumors that the Soviet Union has agreed that the anti-aggression line will not extend to the Far East, which was spread by the previous telegrams, have also been shattered. The Soviet authorities have repeatedly declared to the world: "The Soviet Union is capable of defeating any aggressor attacking from both the East and the West at the same time"! "The Soviet Union does not need any military alliance, triangular alliance"! Now that Molotov is concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and has also ordered the abolition of censorship, it is even more refreshing to international people. It proves that the unprecedented unity and the abundance of power in the Soviet Union are no longer afraid of any conspiracy or poison plan! The active actions of the Soviet Union naturally show that the Soviet Union's efforts in the anti-aggression movement are entirely to realize the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining world peace and liberating oppressed nations, and to realize the policy of maintaining democratic politics and promoting the progress of human culture. There is absolutely no selfish or other attempt. Therefore, we believe that the Soviet Union's actions will promote the current democratic and peaceful countries that still hold on to compromise and anti-Soviet fantasies, will warn all countries that are embarking on the road of aggression and expansion of imperialist war, and will further prove the greatness of the Soviet Union's strength and increase the Soviet Union's prestige in truly maintaining peace in the international community.</p>
<p>(6) Recent Situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>In this struggle on the two fronts, the Chinese anti-Japanese troops, as the main force and vanguard of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front, continue to gain the victories they deserve. According to statistics, in the second half of April, 504 battles were fought, killing 31,965 Japanese officers and soldiers, and capturing 512 Japanese officers and soldiers. In addition, military supplies were seized, transportation was destroyed, Japanese ships were sunk, and Japanese aircraft were shot down. This is not included in the summary. This week, the anti-Japanese army continued to win on all fronts. In northern Jiangxi, they continued to counterattack Fengxin and Nanchang, making the Japanese army exhausted and stabilizing the situation in Hunan and Jiangxi. In central Hunan, the Japanese army again showed signs of invading westward, aiming to capture Guanchang. However, our anti-Japanese army took the initiative to launch an offensive and crossed the Xiang River on May 3rd, attacking in multiple directions, capturing three key points on the Hanyi Highway: Luohan Temple, Sigang City, and others. At the same time, Shaodong and Macheng were also captured, so the Japanese army in central Hunan was also defeated. The situation in the South China battlefield was slightly quiet, while the situation in the West River turned for the better. In North China, the Japanese army received a large number of new recruits, but generally they have no ability to move. The war has entered a phase of stalemate. The counter-offensive military operations in the East China battlefield have made slightly more progress than last week. There were battles in northern Jiangsu and on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, and the New Fourth Army won a victory on the Jinghang Road, using Henglin and Yixing to commemorate May Day. After three days of bloody battles, they inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese aggressor army encountered attacks and defeats everywhere, and the internal situation became more unstable. The entire 31st company of the 23rd Regiment of the 1st Division of the former puppet Mongolian army, led by company commander Yang Xinghua, defected to our side (Guilin Electric on the 2nd). The news that the Japanese army in Tianjin revolted and set fire to warehouses on the 24th of last month has also been confirmed. Moreover, many officers and soldiers of the Japanese army in North China were involved, which made Lieutenant General Sugiyama Gen anxious. At the same time, political conspiracies were also frustrated. Wang Jingwei's anti-communist and peace activities encountered the hatred of the entire Chinese nation. Diplomatically, his enticements and threats to Britain did not gain much under our firm attitude. The economic and financial policies in the occupied areas suffered heavy blows, and the poison of the puppet currency has almost completely failed. In order to save the day, the Japanese × decided to disregard everything and temporarily inspect madly, and carried out continuous crazy bombings of our major states and cities in central, southern, and western China on the 3rd and 4th of the month, bombing Chongqing in total madness. Ningbo in Zhejiang and Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong were also subjected to crazy bombings in recent days. After such inhuman bombings, so-called large-scale advances may follow. However, precisely because the difficulties of the Japanese army are becoming more and more serious, we will not shrink back or compromise, but will increase our hatred and determination to resist aggression, and will increase our confidence in winning the war of resistance. Therefore, the Japanese army is bound to fail, which can be said to be predetermined. However, when we look back at our motherland, with beacon fires everywhere, cities in ruins, and compatriots suffering, how can anyone with a heart not feel sorrow? Supporting the front line, rescuing refugees, serving the country, expanding donations, etc., are more urgently needed for us to work hard to carry out!</p>

A certain unit of our army ambushed a certain key point on the route from Xiang to Pingshuipu in advance, and concentrated artillery fire to strike when the Japanese vehicle approached, destroying the Japanese vehicle, overturning it to the side of the road, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, and seizing more than eighty rifles and many military supplies. Almost none of the Japanese in the vehicle survived.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Miluo, June 9] The Japanese troops in Linxiang moved towards Pingshuipu again on the 5th, attempting to retake the area, but were intercepted by us, suffering more than two hundred casualties. Pingshuipu is still in our hands.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Yichang, May 4] After our troops on the Hanyi Road front captured two major strongholds, Luohan Temple and Duobao Temple, our main forces continued to pursue eastward. The Japanese troops retreated to Zaoshi and Yingcheng. Our troops on the highway front have advanced to Yonglong River and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese forces. Our troops occupying Zhangjie and Jieyu Xinhe are also advancing forward, and at the same time, they are adopting an encirclement formation against the Japanese forces in Tianmen. The Japanese forces have been extremely disorganized after suddenly encountering our night raids, and have left behind a large number of supplies and equipment, which are currently being inventoried.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Yichang, June 6] Fierce battles are ongoing in the Yangjialing, Maqi, and Lingshan Temple areas northwest of Zhongxiang. More than two thousand Japanese forces, under the cover of more than ten cannons, are fiercely attacking us, and multiple Japanese aircraft are constantly bombing.

<p>[Central News Agency Xi'an, May 5] According to military news, after Cai Qingshan, commander of the Huang Xie Army in southern Shanxi, defected to our side, the troops of Li Yao, commander of the Third and Fourth Regiments stationed in Yuncheng, also defected to our side on the 2nd, moving their troops to the area between Yishi and Linfen and conducting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese forces. Currently, Qi Wenping, commander of the puppet Huang Army in southern Shanxi, is preparing to defect to our side recently due to the fact that his subordinates have defected one after another and he lacks the ability to command. The Japanese conspiracy to control China with Chinese finally came to naught.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xingji, May 5] On the 30th of last month, a certain unit of our army encountered more than two hundred Japanese troops in Heishan in Zhongyang. Our army made use of the terrain and lay in ambush, waiting for an opportunity. When the Japanese troops advanced to the mountainside, they were unable to shift. Our army concentrated its firepower and launched a fierce attack. The Japanese troops fled in panic, and our army pursued them, killing more than fifty Japanese troops. We suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation, April 28th to May 4th ... Military Affairs Commission Announcement ...</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that on the northern and southern fronts this week, our forces, under the relentless pressure of our attacking units, have achieved numerous victories and recaptured many areas, causing the enemy to suffer a disastrous defeat with unstoppable momentum. Key results are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front</p>
<p>Around Guangzhou, following the successive recaptures of Huaxian Xin Street last week and the double capture of Zengcheng, along with the capture of key strongholds such as Fuhe and Shiken, in the Paitan area, over 800 enemy officers and soldiers, including enemy regiment commander Eka Getaro, were killed. The periphery is now entirely under our control, and the encirclement is tightening. This week, a portion of our surprise troops briefly entered the city, killing over 500 enemy soldiers. Enemy officers' dependents are successively evacuating, causing extreme panic. Furthermore, 3,000-4,000 enemy troops from Xinhui and Jiangmen have been invading Heshang, Daze, Zhuliuhe, and other areas westward in recent days with great force. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in bloody battles for three days and nights. Although these areas were temporarily lost, by the morning of the 30th, they were all fully recaptured. In the battles of Zhuliuhe and Daze, over 300 enemy soldiers were killed in each location. In the Heshang battle, enemy casualties exceeded 1,000, including 15 officers of the rank of major and lieutenant colonel. Hundreds of barrels of their gasoline were seized. Now, we are taking advantage of the victory to press forward towards Xinhui and Jiangmen. On the eastern, western, and northern fronts of Guangdong province, our forces have gained absolute superiority. In their desperation, the enemy may resort to a last-ditch struggle.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Front</p>
<p>Our troops active in northern Jiangxi, since capturing Gao'an last week, advanced towards Wuning and approached Wuchang. Since the beginning of this week, although the enemy has exerted all its strength to counterattack, our troops, with the momentum of sweeping away remnants, continue to advance, completely shattering the enemy's attempts to resist. Currently, the commanding heights around Wuning are entirely in our hands, and we have once again penetrated into the city. The strongholds of Xiangfuguan, Dachengzhen, and Gaoyou City, northeast of Gao'an, have been successively captured. In recent days, our troops have encircled Fengxin on three sides and launched fierce attacks. A major fire broke out within the city, and enemy barracks and other facilities were reduced to ashes. On the Nanchang front and both banks of the Fu River, key locations such as Hengxi, Liantang, Xiangtang, Shengmi Street, Xiefu City, and Shimin Street have been successively recaptured. Joining forces with the elite troops from Dacheng and Gaoyou, we launched a fierce offensive. The enemy, relying on defensive positions, stubbornly resisted and retreated in defeat. Currently, our vanguard has advanced near the city gates to eliminate remaining enemy forces. In recent days, the number of enemy troops from Wuning, Gao'an, Nanchang, and other areas killed is no less than 2,000. The enemy is doing its best to conscript reinforcements. Approximately 2,000 enemy troops from Nabaping, Zhe River, Haojiadian, and Xujiadian launched a fierce attack from the morning of the 30th towards Sensilin Temple, Dushan Town, Jiuliquan, and Kou Dian. Under the fierce attack of our main forces, suffering over 1,000 casualties, their offensive was thwarted. On the east bank of the Han River, enemy forces near Luohan Temple bombarded Shayang with heavy artillery all day on the 2nd and launched a large number of poison gas shells. At dawn on the 30th, our main forces crossed the river in two columns to launch an attack. The enemy on the east bank, unable to resist, immediately collapsed. Before long, Luohan Temple, Yiduowan, and Sigang City, all key strongholds, were recaptured. Currently, taking advantage of the victory, we are pursuing the defeated enemy in three columns towards Tuochuanbu, Yonglong River, and Yangjiawei. Yuxin River is also under fierce siege. The enemy in Tianmen is extremely shaken. Our troops attacking Macheng in eastern Hubei recaptured the county seat on the 30th and, taking advantage of the victory, successively captured Zhongguanzhen on the 1st and advanced towards Songbu. On the same day, they attacked the Ertaokou enemy airfield, annihilating over 100 enemy soldiers guarding it and burning all 15 aircraft within the airfield. After capturing Xintanbu in southern Hubei, we are now besieging Tongcheng and Chongyang. Furthermore, our main forces are advancing in two columns, one approaching Daye and the other heading directly towards Xianning.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front</p>
<p>Our troops in Shanxi province launched strikes against the enemy who were making disturbances. In southern Shanxi, fierce battles took place from the morning of the 2nd in Quwo, Shouyang, Zhangdianzhen, Wenxi, Anze, Fushan, Jiangcheng, and other locations, killing over 1,500 enemy soldiers and completely destroying all lines of communication, making it impossible for the enemy to coordinate with each other. In eastern Shanxi, the enemy invading Pingyao, Taigu, and Qixian along the Baijin Highway has been engaged in bloody battles for ten days since last week. By the 28th, the enemy on all fronts was defeated and routed, abandoning over 3,000 bodies. In the Lingluozhenshi area of western Shanxi, our troops encircled and fiercely attacked the enemy with the force of a sudden storm, annihilating 500-600 enemy soldiers. In northern Shanxi, the remaining enemy forces entrenched in Jingle and Shenchi are still surrounded by us and will soon be completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Great Victory</p>
<p>Statistics show that in the past ten days or so, our forces on all fronts have killed approximately 8,000 enemy soldiers. Enemy divisional commander Taniguchi was seriously wounded in the battle of Fushan and is reported to have died. In the battle of Anze, regimental commander Mita was also killed. Having suffered these heavy blows, the enemy is extremely fearful and, confined along the Tongpu Railway line, is on the verge of being overwhelmed. In addition, in northern Henan, we captured Xuliang, a key stronghold belonging to Bo'ai. In eastern Henan, we once again attacked the western gate and railway station of Kaifeng on the morning of the 1st. In southern Henan, we defeated the enemy attempting to break out northwestward from Xinyang. In Shandong province, we recaptured Wendeng county seat. In northern Jiangsu, we captured Qiuxian. Yixing and Lishui in Jiangxi, which had fallen into enemy hands for 18 months, witnessed the national flag once again on the 3rd and returned to our control. Severing the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, encircling Bengbu, and controlling Nanjing represent a great victory marking a new era in the eastern theater of operations. In Suiyuan province, we destroyed the Ping-Sui Railway and the Baotou-Baibaimiao Highway, making it impossible to restore the enemy's transportation network between Guihua (Hohhot), Suiyuan, Datong, Baotou, and Baibaimiao. The entire northwestern theater of operations is under our control. These are all important events of the past week, which are of great significance in exposing the enemy's conspiracy and promoting the power of our army.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] Newspapers here are vigorously promoting the seizure of management rights over the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession, citing the inability of third countries to maintain order as justification. "Asahi Shimbun" stated, "Japan will demand temporary control of the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession. While there may not be sufficient grounds for such a demand, if the concession authorities do not give satisfactory answers to Japan's reasonable proposals, then Japan will ultimately be forced to make a demand to control the Shanghai concessions." "Kokumin Shimbun" criticized the government's weak policy, saying that the Japanese government should adopt a tough policy towards the Shanghai concession authorities.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, accompanied by Secretary Dale, flew to Chengdu on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) aircraft at around 10:00 AM on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<h3>The Battle for Gao'an</h3>
<p>— …Fan Shizhi… (Part 1)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gao'an Huibu Air Dispatch] "The enemy's strategy is generally cautious, rarely taking risks. However, in their tactical and combat actions, they often take bold chances." There are many past examples that prove this, and the enemy's recent capture of Nanchang is an excellent example. The frontal battle begins.</p>
<p>The Frontal Battle Begins</p>
<p>After successfully crossing the Xiu River at Liaojia and Zhanggongdu on March 19th and 20th by taking advantage of strong winds, the enemy quickly used its mobile mechanized units to occupy Anyi, Fengxin, and Jing'an within three days. On the evening of the 22nd, some enemy tanks and armored vehicles even infiltrated Dacheng. However, their main infantry force was still far away in Zhangxi, revealing their audacious and risky tactics. At this time, our troops on the Xiang-Gan Highway, to prevent the enemy from outflanking us on the left and right, not only used a portion of their forces to block their advance east towards Nanchang in the Xishan Wanzhuan Palace area, but also transported a certain unit, which had dealt a major blow to the enemy's 101st and 106th Divisions at De'an Wanjialing Zhanggushan last year, to Shanggao by truck, and then proceeded to Gao'an, arriving at 7:00 AM on the 25th, thwarting the enemy's westward advance and completing the most magnificent battle since the beginning of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Spring in central Jiangxi is known for its rainy season. During the battle, there were continuous rains, and the river water rose, effectively restricting the enemy aircraft that had been rampaging for days. After our troops arrived in the Sigongshan Xiangfuguan Lianhuashan area northeast of Gao'an, they first drove out all the enemy scouts and advanced units, built fortifications, and established forward positions at Chitu Ridge and Zhanggu Ridge northeast of Xiangfuguan, with a reserve position near Yuncheng Bridge, less than a mile outside the north gate of Gao'an, and maintained their main strength near Gaoyou City. On the 26th, over a thousand enemy infantry arrived at Dacheng and advanced rapidly towards Gao'an. By evening, some of them had made minor contact with our guard troops. On the 27th, the majority of the enemy advanced to Hucun and Liucun, four miles northeast of Xiangfuguan, and began a frontal battle with us, with little change by evening. On the 28th, the enemy's main force arrived and began to harass our positions everywhere, but they were all repelled. At this time, the enemy's mechanized units were moving from Dacheng towards Gao'an. Therefore, we divided our forces and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's flank and rear in Longpi Juxia, five miles east of Xiangfuguan, that night.</p>
<p>Two Company Commanders Who Bravely Charged Despite Their Wounds</p>
<p>After taking fire from their flank and rear, the enemy retreated slightly. At 6:00 AM on the 29th, eight enemy tanks arrived and attacked us again, but one was destroyed by our steel-core bullets. Having suffered this setback, the enemy retreated again, and we sent troops to destroy the damaged tank. We suffered over 100 casualties, and the enemy suffered 200. At 3:00 PM, the enemy received support from its rear guard and launched tear gas and suffocating gas in Hucun, four miles northeast of Xianfuguan, while simultaneously launching a fierce attack with tanks and infantry. Company commanders Li Yiming and Jin Jizhong, despite being wounded, inspired the entire army with their spirit of bravely charging despite their wounds, and crushed the enemy forces. At 4:00 PM, another 500 enemy soldiers, launching poison gas, attacked Zhanggu Ridge, northwest of Xiangfuguan, under the cover of seven tanks, but they were repelled by us. The enemy suffered over 250 casualties, and we captured 24 rifles, dozens of steel helmets, documents, and other items. After four days of repeated defeats, the enemy transferred two or more regiments from Wanshou Palace to Xianfuguan and, at dawn on the 30th, launched a fierce attack on our Zhanggu Ridge position. The intensity of the battle far exceeded the battles of the previous four days. However, our officers and soldiers calmly resisted and fought bravely. After half a day of battle, the enemy suffered over 500 casualties, leaving over 200 bodies in front of our positions and retreating. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>British Consulate in Chongqing Bombed Britain Lodges Strong Protest Clark Kerr Visits Japanese Foreign Minister One German Woman Also Killed in Bombing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Tokyo dispatch: According to reliable sources, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has verbally protested to the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the bombing of the British Consulate in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, stating that the matter is extremely serious and hoping that the Japanese side can take appropriate measures to prevent such incidents from recurring.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Shanghai dispatch: The British Embassy stated that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has notified Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that a bomb landed on the British Consulate's dormitory when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing the other day, killing eleven British staff members. After receiving instructions from the British government, Craigie will lodge another strong protest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] The major fire caused by Thursday's Japanese air raid is still raging. The total number of dead and wounded is currently estimated to be around 5,000. Foreigners have now formed an International Relief Committee to assist the Central Relief Commission in aiding homeless refugees. President Chiang Kai-shek has allocated 1 million yuan to the effort.</p>
<p>Two miles of the Yangtze River bank are filled with refugees, sleeping in the open air. Others are carrying their few belongings across the river to take shelter. The road from Chongqing to Chengdu is teeming with refugees. There are fewer pedestrians on the streets of the city.</p>
<p>Chongqing was shrouded in heavy fog yesterday, and there was heavy rain in the early morning, which helped to extinguish the flames. Only two fires remain unextinguished, but they are also under control.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers and boatmen are making several times their normal profits by transporting refugees all night, and some are even taking the opportunity to raise fares exorbitantly.</p>
<p>Foreigners are also preparing to cross the river and move to safer places, but they lack food and drinking water.</p>
<p>Most of the shops in the city are closed, and shopkeepers are moving their goods. Some telephone lines have been repaired, but some streets are blocked by rubble and cannot be accessed. President Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the mobilization of all public and private vehicles in the city to evacuate residents.</p>
<p>According to Chinese reports, Japanese aircraft scattered leaflets saying they would destroy the entire city within seven days.</p>
<p>The heavy rain today is hindering rescue work. Corpses are piling up, and the stench is overpowering. Chongqing has many rats, and since the Chinese people traditionally bury their dead, there are fears of an epidemic breaking out in the city.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has allocated another 2 million yuan for relief, bringing the total to 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] After days of relentless bombing by enemy aircraft, Chongqing residents have begun to evacuate to the surrounding countryside. Yesterday alone, the number of people leaving here totaled approximately 100,000. It is reported that several refugee camps have been built in the suburbs of Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] After yesterday's air raid, fires broke out in many parts of the city, but all have been extinguished by this morning. Several streets are blocked by rubble and debris and cannot be traversed. Electricity, telephone, and water services have been partially restored. The exact number of casualties from this air raid is not yet known, as rescue work has not yet been carried out in the vast areas that have been destroyed, so the extent of the casualties is unknown. Many are believed to be buried in the rubble. The number of casualties from this air raid is the largest in the twenty-three months since the start of the war. According to estimates from a reliable source, the number of wounded, dead, and buried is between four and five thousand. Reuters reporters patrolled Chongqing last night, where several places were still burning. Apart from that, the entire city of Chongqing was completely dark. The only people on the streets were those who had fled the bombing the day before, returning to their homes to try to retrieve some essential items. Relief workers are continuing their arduous work. Some government officials have formed an organization to evacuate refugees. President Chiang Kai-shek has appointed General He Yingqin to be fully responsible for relief efforts. President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife's personal vehicles have been made available for transporting refugees. The nine newspapers in Chongqing published a joint issue today. The main editorial stated, "This is one of the most tragic pages in Chinese journalistic history, but it also shows China's determination to continue the war of resistance under any circumstances. We will strengthen our organization to respond to the enemy's barbaric actions. Our unity and organization will shatter the enemy's ambitions."</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee Approves Reply to Soviet Note Avoids Military Alliance Re-proposes Joint Defense of Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting today to discuss the French government's memorandum (regarding the British government's proposed counter-proposal to the Soviet Union, which had been sent to the French government for its opinion). It immediately drafted instructions to be sent to Sir William Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, instructing him to send a note verbale to the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov. Diplomatic circles here believe that the British government's intention is that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov does not mean that the Soviet Union has changed its foreign policy. If not, it would not have sent another note verbale to the Soviet government. The contents of this note are not disclosed by official sources.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee recently passed a memorandum stating that the UK cannot accept the Soviet Union's demand for a three-nation military alliance under current circumstances. After the memorandum was passed, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax immediately sent it to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union for transmission to the Soviet Foreign Minister. The content does not reject the Soviet proposal but merely states the reasons why it cannot be accepted at present. According to a British spokesman, the UK is not closing the door to a future military agreement, despite making such a reply. Chamberlain is now awaiting the Soviet Union's reaction to this and hopes to clarify whether Soviet foreign policy has changed due to Litvinov's resignation. The British reply solemnly declared that only when Britain and France are actively involved in assisting oppressed nations will they expect the Soviet Union to join the anti-aggression front. This move by the UK is clearly intended to allay Soviet concerns, as the Soviet Union fears being dragged into a whirlpool while Britain and France stand idly by.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax intends to instruct British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Seeds, to visit Molotov today and present the British response to the Soviet proposal. It is understood that the UK intends to avoid the Soviet proposal for a British, French, and Soviet military alliance and re-propose that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be prepared to defend the countries of Eastern Europe and prevent aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British government will shortly issue instructions to the British Ambassador to Moscow regarding the British reply to the Soviet government's proposals. London believes that the contents of the British reply will, in principle, maintain the Soviet proposal while adding the opinions of major allied nations regarding various plans to resist aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tallinn, Estonia, 6th] The Estonian cabinet has approved the German proposal for a non-aggression treaty in principle. Latvian Foreign Minister Vilhelms Munters will arrive here tonight to discuss the German proposal with the Estonian government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Undersecretary of State Butler said in the House of Commons today that the British government currently has no intention of including the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in the British protection or mutual assistance agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] The Soviet Supreme Soviet is scheduled to convene on May 25th.</p>
<h3>Poland's Attitude is Firm: Denies Germany's Right to Repudiate Treaty; France Declares Support for Poland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] The Polish government's reply to Germany's recent ultimatum declaring the abandonment of the 1934 German-Polish agreement refutes that the Anglo-Polish understanding cannot coexist with the German-Polish non-aggression pact. It firmly states that Hitler has no right to abandon the treaty. If the German government can value a good-neighborly policy and make formal suggestions, the Polish government will, based on the Polish viewpoint, be prepared to sincerely consider them.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 6th] When Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck concluded his speech yesterday, thunderous applause erupted. When the parliament passed the address, even the Ukrainian representatives joined in praise. General Śmigły-Rydz, the hero who captured Vilnius for Poland, who had always opposed Beck's policies, also rose from his seat, stepped forward, shook Beck's hand, and congratulated him. No representatives from the Axis powers attended the session. Observers generally viewed Beck's speech as moderate yet firm, sufficient to show Poland's sincerity in upholding peace, but only on the principle of not compromising its honor.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] Demonstrators gathered in front of the Polish Foreign Ministry today, demanding to see Foreign Minister Beck. Responding to the enthusiasm of the people, Beck appeared on the balcony to meet with them and gave a brief speech, declaring that the era of diplomatic competition has passed, and from now on, the whole country should adopt a resolute attitude.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 5th] Regarding France's determination to faithfully maintain its commitments to Poland, Daladier issued a declaration to confirm it. This morning, all newspapers prominently published Daladier's declaration, but the editorials of the newspapers differed slightly. According to political circles, the Prime Minister's move was due to an article published in the newspapers by Marcel Déat, a representative of the Social Republican Party, arguing that the French people should not fight for Poland's excessive demands regarding Danzig and East Prussia. Therefore, he issued a declaration to reaffirm France's credibility. According to news from the 'Le Temps' this morning, the Polish Ambassador, Juliusz Łukasiewicz, yesterday specifically sent a note to Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet to inquire about Marcel Déat's article. The Foreign Minister immediately assured that the article would absolutely not affect France's attitude, and the French government was determined to abide by its agreements. It was also reported that Léger told the Polish Ambassador that once Poland felt that its vital interests were threatened, France would automatically come to its aid. The so-called vital interests referred to the Danzig area. The Polish Ambassador expressed satisfaction with the Prime Minister's declaration.</p>
<p>Favorable Impression in Britain and France</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The press here warmly supports Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech, saying that the speech is firm in substance and moderate in wording. The "Daily Telegraph" stated, "If Foreign Minister Beck's speech fails to ease the tense situation, it is not Beck's fault. Hitler has no excuse for refusing friendly negotiations." The "News Chronicle" stated, "Beck's speech does not contain any provocative elements, but clearly states that any attempt to seize and annex Danzig will meet with the resistance of the entire Polish nation." The "Times" stated, "Foreign Minister Beck has given a good account of Poland's attitude. This statement includes a strong national sentiment and constructive suggestions. Both sides can resolve the relevant issues through calm and rational negotiations without the need for war. However, if an attempt is made to implement a forceful solution, it will turn a local dispute into a major problem that the world is no longer prepared to tolerate."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Beck's speech has been carefully studied in London, and the impression is extremely favorable in all quarters. However, no official announcement has been made. Diplomatic circles regard the moderate and clear wording of the speech as its most outstanding feature. Everyone is now watching what Germany's reaction will be. The two leaders of the Nazi Party in Danzig are currently holding talks with Hitler in Berchtesgaden, which is noteworthy, as the Czech situation can serve as a precedent. Diplomatic circles further pointed out that Beck's speech mentioned the unilateral abandonment of the German-Polish non-aggression treaty. Those who have treaties with Germany should also be wary of this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The speech by Colonel Beck is considered peaceful, resolute, and statesmanlike. Regarding the Danzig section, the intention is certainly to reject the German demands, but because of its skillful wording, no one can regard it as provocative. Those who hope that Germany will take the opportunity to change course and seek a peaceful solution with Poland can be slightly more optimistic. Rome intends to offer itself as a mediator in this matter. It is generally speculated that Beck's resolute tone this time, coupled with the recent declarations by Britain and France explicitly stating that if Poland is invaded, they will certainly stand up to help, should let Germany know that the democratic countries are not just paying lip service. If they still rashly attempt to repeat their annexation of Czechoslovakia in the Baltic Sea area, it will inevitably lead to a major war.</p>
<p>German Officials Express Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Hitler spent the entire afternoon today in Berchtesgaden with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the leaders of the Nazi Party in Danzig discussing Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech. Ribbentrop is scheduled to leave for Italy tonight. Germany's attitude will not be formed until Poland's formal reply and Beck's speech have been thoroughly studied. However, the initial unofficial impression of Beck's speech is that Poland has become "depraved." The Germans are now engaged in heated debate, discussing the possibility of Germany occupying Danzig without firing a shot.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] The German official opinion on Beck's speech will be published in the "Foreign Affairs Correspondence" tonight. Its thorough opposition to Beck's speech is quite like Hitler's recent reply to Roosevelt. It is claimed that Colonel Beck tried hard to embellish and defend the drastic changes in Polish policy since the end of March. But Beck is mistaken if he thinks that his sudden change of policy from 1934 and joining the British encirclement front can be tolerated by Germany. This must be stated. The official news agency also extracted a section of Colonel Beck's speech tonight and published it in a newspaper with the headline "Beck Wrongly Attempts to Distract Attention! Rejects German Suggestions." At the same time, newspapers are publishing a large number of rumors about Polish anti-German sentiment, including reports that Poles are marching in Poznan, deliberately creating an idol of Hitler, hanging it on a guillotine, and holding demonstrations outside the German consulate, shouting abuse.</p>
<p>Romania Values Soviet Policy</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 5th] Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaetano, recently wrote an article in the "Italian Daily" commenting on Beck's speech, warning Poland to avoid adopting a "bluffing attitude" against Germany. He further advised Poland to only consider its own interests and not allow its interests to be set aside for the interests of others. Gaetano went on to point out that it was purely due to Mussolini's personal intervention and Italy's actions that the Polish-Hungarian border issue was resolved according to Poland's wishes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 5th] Well-informed sources criticize Colonel Beck's speech as representing strength, dignity, and determination. At the same time, they say that his tone is not overbearing. Even regarding the section on Germany and Poland discussing the issue of Danzig and the Corridor on an equal footing in the future, Colonel Beck has not left room for consultation. In reality, what kind of policy the Soviet Union will adopt is even more important than Colonel Beck's speech. More than forty-eight hours have passed since Litvinov resigned, and the Soviet Union has not yet issued any statement clarifying its foreign policy, which is noteworthy. It is generally speculated that if Stalin intends to maintain Litvinov's policy (with slight changes in details), Moscow should have made a statement long ago.</p>
<h3>Franco's Army Parade Postponed Again to the 21st</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] It is reported that Franco's victory parade in Madrid has been set for the 21st of this month. The date of this parade has been repeatedly postponed. Now, authoritative sources claim that this date will not be postponed again.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Arrives in Milan: Begins Talks with Italian Foreign Minister; Continues on Sunday</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 6th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, along with his wife and many staff members, arrived here at 11:00 AM today. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the German Ambassador to Rome, von Mackensen, greeted them at the station.

<h3>Serious Labor Unrest Occurs in US Coal Mining Area: 460,000 People Participate in Strike; Industries in Various Cities Greatly Threatened</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 5th] The largest strike in American history began today, with 466,000 coal miners participating. The government is trying to prevent its spread. Coal is gradually becoming scarce, and industries in major cities are greatly threatened. One million metal miners have not yet joined, and they have agreed to continue negotiations until next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] The number of workers on strike in the Appalachian coal mining area has reached 460,000, and the supply of coal is already scarce. It is reported that the miners are still willing to continue negotiations. Several transportation companies are now considering importing coal from Europe if the coal shortage becomes more severe.</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Send Consul to Slovakia: "De Facto" Recognition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The British government has recently decided to grant Slovakia "de facto" recognition and has appointed Mr. Barnes as the British Consul in the Slovak capital. This move has been agreed to by the Slovak government.</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Discusses the International Situation: Pays Close Attention to British Policy; We Will Definitely Reject Humiliating Peace</h3>
<p>The famous diplomat, Mr. Chen Youren, received newspaper reporters yesterday and spoke freely about the Polish Corridor and the Danzig issue, as well as the impact of the Anglo-Soviet military alliance on the Far East.</p>
<p>Regarding Europe</p>
<p>He said, "If Hitler firmly believes that advancing towards Poland will not cause a major European war, then he will insist on resolving the status of Danzig in a Nazi manner and building highways to connect the Polish Corridor. But if the Soviet Union does not interfere with Germany's actions to support Poland, then a European war will not occur. Under such circumstances, Chamberlain can easily obtain Daladier's consent and follow the path of Munich to guide the 'lion of least resistance.' This is very possible. The exact reasons for Litvinov's resignation are not yet known. A certain right-wing newspaper in Paris claimed that Molotov, who succeeded Litvinov as Soviet Foreign Minister, strongly opposed cooperation between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. If this is true, then the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet military alliance may not necessarily be realized. If such a military alliance fails to materialize, it will have a serious impact on the new development of Chamberlain's European policy, but it will not be detrimental to China. China can make Voroshilov believe in the importance of the East and eliminate the threat of Japan before encountering the Nazi danger in the West. If an Anglo-Soviet military alliance can still be concluded after Litvinov's resignation, then what are the advantages and disadvantages of this alliance for China's war of resistance? Since this alliance is Britain's guarantee of the Soviet Union's European border, the Soviet Union's concern for the security of its western border can be reduced, and assistance to China can be increased."</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East</p>
<p>"If China is not included in the scope of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, then Britain will insist that Soviet military forces be concentrated in the West to cope with German aggression and will try to prevent Soviet military forces from being 'dispersed' in the Far East. The development of this British policy is not only extremely dangerous for China's war of resistance, but may also be used to mediate 'peace' in the hands of those who are focused on 'appeasement' like Mr. Chamberlain. The British ruling class has already shown this kind of omen. The British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, is safe in Shanghai and staying in Chongqing, which has been repeatedly bombed. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, met with Ambassador Clark Kerr in Shanghai on the eve of Ambassador Clark Kerr's visit to Chongqing. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, the meeting between these two ambassadors can be said to be 'the precursor to British mediation of the Sino-Japanese War.' At the London China Association banquet four days ago, the British Minister for Coordination of Defence, Lord Chatfield, also foresaw cooperation between China and Japan in the Far East. In theory, we cannot oppose Britain's mediation of peace, but the concept of true peace must mean that China obtains survival in this difficult and arduous war, and becomes stronger and continues to be a sovereign, independent, and territorially complete nation. China will resolutely reject peace negotiations that actually cede territory or are annexed to the Japanese Empire under the pretext of the 'New Order in East Asia' (such as the annexation of Korea). You cannot negotiate peace with someone who is determined to kill you. The only thing you can discuss with them is your funeral."</p>
<h3>German Fleet Arrives in Lisbon</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 6th] The German warships "Spee" commanded by Admiral Boehm, the cruiser "Köln," the transport ship "Wasner," and six submarines arrived here on the 6th for a five-day stop.</p>
<h3>British King and Queen Depart for Canada: Thunderous Cheers at London Station; US Prepares Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Prime Minister Chamberlain and other cabinet members were on the platform at Waterloo Station to see off the King. The King boarded the train a few seconds before it departed and had a brief conversation with Foreign Secretary Halifax. The scenes at Buckingham Palace and Waterloo Station were televised. After the King and Queen kissed Queen Mary and members of the royal family, the royal family left the station to see them off. The crowd of well-wishers was very large and the shouts were deafening. When the King's special train arrived at Portsmouth at 2:10 PM, the crowd there also gave enthusiastic cheers. Later, the King and Queen walked through the square to receive the keys to the Portsmouth fortress.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] All preparations for the British King and Queen's visit to Canada and the United States have been completed. They will depart from Portsmouth tomorrow on the Empress of Australia of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company. The entourage totals thirty people. Lady Nunham and Lady Seymour will serve as ladies-in-waiting, and Lord Airlie will serve as lord-in-waiting. The King is accompanied by two secretaries and two military attaches. The Empress of Australia has already left Southampton for Portsmouth today. As soon as the King and Queen board the ship, the British naval ensign will be hoisted on the ship. This is the first time that a merchant ship has hoisted the naval ensign without being in service. The British battleship "Repulse" will escort the ship to a certain distance in the Atlantic Ocean. Only two Reuters news reporters and one photographer are allowed to accompany the King. Reporters from other British and American newspapers will gather at the locations where the King and Queen will be staying.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Interest in the British King's visit to the United States is gradually increasing here. Newspapers are vying to publish portraits of the King and Queen. When the King and Queen arrive in Washington, President Roosevelt, members of Congress, and diplomats will welcome them. A ceremony will be held, and the King and Queen will be escorted to the White House by a cavalry unit, an armored vehicle team, and thirty tanks as guests of President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Discusses the Current Situation Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 6th] Well-informed sources say that Litvinov's resignation, Beck's speech, and Poland's memorandum to the German government will be the main issues discussed at the French cabinet meeting this morning. It is reported that French Foreign Minister Bonnet will clarify the French government's attitude towards the Polish memorandum and explain the reasons for Litvinov's resignation and Molotov's appointment as Foreign Minister. At the same time, Prime Minister Daladier will present his speech on France's foreign policy stance, which he will deliver to the parliament on Thursday.</p>
<h3>International Current Situation Column: A Horizontal Discussion (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liao Chongsheng</p>
<p>According to news confirmed in early February, the US authorities have specifically authorized France to purchase military aircraft from it, with a value rumored to reach a huge sum of £13 million. It is also reported that President Roosevelt stated at a hearing of the Senate Military Committee that the United States has the necessity to help democratic countries fight against dictators; and said that he would implement his proposition with actions. Selling aircraft to France is one aspect of this. If the opportunity arises, other democratic countries will be given the same assistance. It is even said that Roosevelt said that 'the American front line is in France'. For a time, the reaction of domestic public opinion was mixed with praise and criticism. Those who supported it said, "The move by Britain and France to purchase aircraft is tantamount to obtaining the privilege of consolidating the outpost of its national defense (referring to the United States) at the price of cash. This transaction is very fortunate for us. From a national defense standpoint, currently supplying Britain and France with one aircraft is equivalent to increasing the US Air Force's aircraft by ten in six months. Because the outer defense line of American peace and security is Britain and France, not the Atlantic Ocean, which is almost obvious." (See New York World Telegram). At the same time, those who criticize it have three main reasons: (1) Selling military aircraft has the disadvantage of exposing national defense secrets. (2) Although there are no explicit provisions prohibiting the supply of German and Italian military equipment, in fact, it will undoubtedly be on the list of restrictions. Now, following France's request and providing it with assistance is tantamount to favoring one over the other, which will inevitably drag the United States into the whirlpool of the European war and then stop. (3) Selling aircraft to France will promote Germany to intensify the expansion of its air force, and at this point, the United States will find it difficult to lag behind others. As a result, it is only enough to increase the unnecessary burden of the people! Summarizing President Roosevelt's defense, in addition to solemnly declaring that the sale of aircraft did not reveal military secrets, he only said that the purpose of this move was twofold: one was to enable the factories to resume work and the unemployed people to be aided. The second is to promote the moderate continuation of the aircraft industry to meet the needs of national defense. As for the argument that favoring one over the other will drag the country into the whirlpool of the European war, it was refuted. When asked if the government would refuse if Germany and Italy applied to purchase aircraft, Roosevelt replied that this was a 'hypothetical' question and did not need to be answered. The implication is not only known by the wise!</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's determination to sanction aggression is already obvious, but to what extent can his proposition be implemented? This is what we are eager to explore. The United States is a country of tripartite checks and balances. According to the provisions of its constitution, the head of the executive branch is the commander-in-chief of the national army, navy, and air force, and has the power to conclude treaties and appoint envoys; however, any treaty concluded and any envoy appointed must be approved and agreed to by the Senate before it can take effect. As for the power to declare war, it is entirely in the hands of Congress. In this situation, the President's influence seems very weak; however, according to historical records, the country's major diplomatic plans have been secretly negotiated by its head of state and envoys without the approval of Congress. Examples are everywhere. For example, the Monroe Doctrine, which is known to everyone, was secretly negotiated by the US President and the British diplomatic authorities, obtaining Britain's tacit agreement to use force as a backing; its establishment was only officially announced by President Monroe and Secretary of State (John Quincy Adams). It was neither requested the approval of Congress nor approved by the Senate, but the whole country was bound by this policy. Another example is when President Theodore Roosevelt served as the mediator in the Russo-Japanese War, he secretly warned Germany and France not to help Imperial Russia; otherwise, the United States would not hesitate to help Japan to resist. This is the most extreme example of the country's president conducting secret diplomacy. After the Treaty of Versailles, which was drafted by President Wilson in person in 1920, was rejected by the Senate, successive presidents, learning from the past lessons, were cautious about secret consultations on international relations. For example, in 1931, President Hoover, in order to alleviate the European economic panic, specifically sought the opinion of the Senate before daring to negotiate the postponement of European war debts for one year, which was so cautious. Although the restrictions of Congress are strict, there are still many ways for the President to control diplomacy.</p>
<p>Brief commentary</p>
<h3>Youth Day Celebration Assembly</h3>
<p>The entire Hong Kong Youth League will jointly hold a Youth Day celebration assembly at the Confucius Hall today. In this day when our nation is suffering from indiscriminate bombing and slaughter by the invaders, in this day when our motherland's resistance war has entered a new and difficult stage, we feel that we should give this grand gathering of all Hong Kong youth our utmost attention.</p>
<p>Youth Day was born from the blood of countless martyrs and advanced individuals who have strived for national liberation since the May Fourth Movement! Therefore, when we commemorate Youth Day today, everyone should be extremely solemn and vigilant. Everyone should remember the spirit of the martyrs and advanced individuals who sacrificed themselves for the country and the nation and bravely fought against the invaders, traitors, and national betrayers. Now that the situation is so difficult, the invaders and traitors are even more crazy and vicious, and the lifeblood of the country and the nation is in our youth's hands. How should we respect ourselves and spur ourselves on!</p>
<p>The great alliance of all Hong Kong youth is unprecedented and a day worth commemorating. From today onwards, we must unite closely, advance hand in hand, and form a solid united front. If, after the "ceremony ends and the meeting is adjourned," we are still a scattered pile of sand, this will not only be a betrayal of the significance of this great alliance but also a grave disservice to our country and compatriots! It would also be a great disservice to our martyrs, advanced individuals, and ourselves! Everyone must be determined to self-reproach. If I cannot strive to advocate or promote the regular unity of youth groups in this grand event, it will be a serious failure, and I should be ashamed!</p>
<p>The Youth Self-Renewal Movement is indeed very important to the youth of all circles in Hong Kong. However, we hope that the youth of all circles, especially the youth leaders, can also pay attention to the current issues of learning and self-cultivation in the youth circle. Because the motherland's War of Resistance urgently needs young cadres, and the construction of the rear area and the nation-building cause also require new talents. We cannot be satisfied with merely passing grades in our daily studies. We must also learn the knowledge of striving for national liberation in this great era and cultivate ourselves into pillars of national and social undertakings. These knowledge and self-cultivation can only be obtained in all practical salvation and mass movement work. We youth should no longer be self-enclosed! We should no longer be content with temporary ease! We should take the lives of Jews without a country as a warning; and the spirit of hard struggle of the martyrs and advanced individuals since the May Fourth Movement can be an example for us. Collective learning systems, such as current affairs seminars and lecture meetings, and movement cultivation methods, such as participating in practical salvation work, are all major roads that we should take today. "If the times are not difficult, what use are we?" Let us all move forward from more arduous struggles! The glory of victory? is already beckoning us! Liao Chongsheng</p>

<h3>Western Merchants' Association Forms Special Committee to Study Land Lease Terms Requirements for Extension of 75-Year Lease Terms</h3>
<p>The enjoyment and management of building lots in Hong Kong is based on the lease system. Most major cities in the world follow this system. The true owner of all building lots in Hong Kong is the Hong Kong government, and the party with management rights is only the lessee. The lease term for building lots in central Hong Kong is</p>
<p>Lease Term</p>
<p>Some are for 75 years, some are for 999 years, and some are for 75 years plus 75 years. Generally, after the lessee bids and wins from the government, they pay the land price and also pay a certain amount of land tax annually according to the stipulated grade. When the lease term expires, the Hong Kong government can take it back at any time and put it out for bidding again. If the lessee (commonly known as the owner) wants to continue the lease management, they must re-determine the price of the land according to the market price at the time, as well as the amount of land tax to be paid annually in the future, and then pay the government according to the amount before they can obtain the continued management rights of the land. This is the</p>
<p>Land System</p>
<p>The land system in Hong Kong is as described above. However, the lease term for land bidding is divided into three types. Therefore, the initial lessees feel that it is unfair that the building lots under their lease management are only for 75 years, compared to the two lease terms of 75 years plus 75 years (i.e., 150 years, but divided into two terms; after the first 75 years expire, the land price and tax amount must also be re-determined before the second 75-year term can be continued) and 999 years. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the Western Merchants' Association, which forwarded it to the Hong Kong government, requesting that the lease term for the building lots under their lease be</p>
<p>Extended Term</p>
<p>to 150 years without re-determining the land price and tax amount. However, the government department believes that the current land price is quite different from that of decades ago. This kind of request cannot be easily granted. However, according to the original system steps, it is not impossible to re-determine the increased price and tax amount after the expiration. Therefore, it instructed the Western Merchants' Association to conduct a thorough study of the issue and submit a detailed reply for consideration and disposal. Now, the Western Merchants' Association has organized a special committee to start a detailed discussion and study of the current land system in Hong Kong to determine whether it is necessary to modify or change it.</p>
<h3>Concentrate Efforts to Relieve Compatriots Overseas Chinese Association Established Yesterday Inauguration Ceremony Held in Kowloon Yesterday Plans to Establish Branches in Various Places to Work</h3>
<p>In order to concentrate the power of overseas Chinese to connect with overseas Chinese, relieve compatriots in distress in various places, and assist in the production of overseas Chinese, the Overseas Chinese Association held its opening ceremony at the Kowloon Restaurant in [place name unclear] at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than a hundred members and guests attended, and the atmosphere was very warm. When the time came, Chairman Zhang Bai [name unclear] led the unveiling ceremony and delivered the opening speech. He briefly stated that the association began preparations in March last year. Although the progress was quite smooth at the time, the drafting of the association's articles of association and the reporting to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs took a long time. At the same time, the fall of Guangzhou caused the preparatory members of the association to be scattered. This really affected the association's progress a lot. Thanks to the joint efforts of all members to maintain and uphold the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's great selflessness, they continued to work hard, hence today's achievements. At the same time, the opening ceremony was delayed until today. The association has a very important responsibility in the midst of national crisis, and the road ahead is long. It is hoped that everyone will work hard on the association's affairs, establish branches in various places, concentrate the strength of overseas Chinese, relieve our displaced compatriots in distress, and abide by the spirit of the general mobilization promulgated by the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, and strive for final victory. After the speech, congratulatory messages from various parties were read, including the Wan'an [name unclear] Association, Zhonghe Academy, Vietnam Tokyo Comrade Society, Zhongshan Longzhen Association of Compatriots, Tengxing Pingle General Labor Union, Wenhua School, and Vietnam China National Salvation Association. Finally, the chairman gave a reply, and photos were taken. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>A Group of Youths Forced to Come to Hong Kong to Fight for the Issue of Hanging Flags in the Shanghai Concession — Qi Zhuo</h3>
<p>They Hate Workers Who are Pessimistic Due to Threats from Evil Forces</p>
<p>"Report! I caught three patriotic elements today!"</p>
<p>"Report! I caught five patriotic elements today!"</p>
<p>"Report! There's another meeting going on somewhere, and they've hung up the Chinese flag!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The amount of money a petty English traitor can earn each day is directly proportional to the number of patriotic elements they can catch each day. Under the threat of the [unclear] people, the French Concession in Shanghai cannot see the light of day. Compatriots who are separated from their motherland are swallowing their tears and yearning for "Give Me Back My Freedom!"</p>
<p>It was around the 20th of last month when the citizens of Shanghai uniformly hung up the national flag to carry out the spiritual mobilization campaign. A series of moving and tragic events then followed.</p>
<p>Hanging the national flag is a thorn in the side of the [unclear] people and traitors. Fortunately, the International Settlement still has freedom, but the French Concession absolutely forbids it. After the "no permission," what happens? Although the methods are different, the intention of hanging the national flag is the same.</p>
<p>Some adopt a "guerrilla" style. "You tear it down, I'll put the national flag back up. You tear it down, I'll hang the national flag back up." Some sacrifice their businesses by closing their shops and hanging the national flag on the glass windows to see if you dare to smash them. Some hang the national flag in front of locked doors to see who you go to interfere with. ... The French Concession is still a world of national flags. This is where the national soul is entrusted, this is a symbol of indignation.</p>
<p>Then, the tragedy of tearing down the national flag, insulting the national flag, and arresting citizens was openly staged in broad daylight! Young students and the general public could no longer tolerate it and fought with the evil hands, eventually being arrested and thrown into dark iron windows. The entire citizenry became indignant and went on strike.</p>
<p>Collective action forced the evil hands to make some concessions. The "regulation" that originally only allowed the Chinese flag to be hung on National Day was finally increased from one day a year—National Day—to eight days—eight important anniversaries. Although they reluctantly resumed work and the market, the spark of hatred spread and deepened. The "terrorists" who were deemed to be "disrupting the peace of the concession" were finally forced to leave schools and families. Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student Wartime Service Corps was forced to leave Shanghai and was a new salvation work team organized on the ship after leaving Shanghai. There are eleven or twelve of them, four of whom are women, all of whom are middle school students or above, and many of them come from wealthy families. When they were in Shanghai, they belonged to various salvation groups. In order to participate in the struggle for the county flag, they were finally forced to "leave the country immediately," otherwise they would have to "go to jail." Because they had to "leave the country immediately," they fled in a hurry without sufficient preparation. Because they were afraid of being stopped by their families, they secretly left the dark world. Their families still don't know, and it goes without saying that they didn't bring clothes or money. Each person only had a few dozen yuan of national currency hastily borrowed. After paying the fare, they were already "penniless." They arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago and are now living in a small school. What about their lives? Thirteen people eat for six cents a meal, either dry bread or porridge, supported by some comrades who still have things they can pawn. They have endured all kinds of hardships while working in Shanghai and are prepared to endure even more hardships in the future. They hate the general workers who are threatened by evil forces and become passive and pessimistic, so their enthusiasm burns like fire and their will is as firm as iron.</p>
<p>Now they are preparing to go to Guilin. When they arrive in Guilin, organizations will contact them, and they will be able to find work opportunities. But how to get from Hong Kong to Guilin? How will they maintain their lives during their stay in Hong Kong? This will depend on the help of the Hong Kong Salvation League and enthusiastic overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>They are a group who have fought against the [unclear] people and traitors in Shanghai; they are a group who have been in prison and suffered hardships; they are a group who are unwilling to be passive and pessimistic due to the threat of evil; they are a group who have escaped "privileged lives" and participated in the arduous national liberation struggle; this group needs our sympathy, help, and encouragement to allow their vitality to develop and grow well in suffering.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senator Hu Mulan Avoids the Road Submits a Telegram to the Authorities Requesting Permission to Resign</h3>
<p>The first meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senate is about to be held. All senators are required to report to the meeting between the 11th and 14th. Ms. Hu Mulan, a senator currently residing in Hong Kong, believes that senators must be selected from among those who have made meritorious service and are of outstanding virtue, and from among those who are exceptionally talented in all aspects, so that they can offer novel ideas and wisdom and turn the tide. In recent years, I have been living in Hong Kong to care for my mother and have only occasionally participated in women's work. I am simply following the example of advanced individuals and fulfilling my duty. I believe that I have made very little contribution to the party and the country, so how could I have any other expectations? Yesterday, I sent a telegram to the Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senate of the Supreme National Defense Conference, requesting permission to resign from the position of Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senator to avoid blocking the path of the worthy.</p>
<h3>New World Theatre Site Lease Will Soon Expire Hong Kong Government Invites Bids for Lease Bidding to be Held on the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of residents in Hong Kong has increased sharply, and all kinds of retail businesses, due to the large number of consumers, have suddenly become prosperous, especially entertainment venues such as stages and cinemas, all of which are making great profits. Therefore, those who are proceeding to establish cinemas are still actively planning. The New World Theatre, located on Des Voeux Road Central and adjacent to Wing On and Sincere companies, has been specializing in Cantonese films in recent years and has been quite successful. However, the property of the theater belongs to the Hong Kong government. Each time the government grants a lease, it is limited to three years. The lease of the current lessee of the theater will expire on September 1 this year. The government authorities published it in the gazette yesterday, inviting bids for the lease. Those who are interested in undertaking this business can submit a deposit of two thousand yuan to the Hong Kong Land Registry before noon on the 15th of this month. Once the bids are opened in public, the authorities will be able to choose a lessee to grant the lease, which is also for a term of three years. It is reported that there are many people who have been committed to this film entertainment business in recent years, so there should be many contractors competing for the bid at that time.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Flew to Chongqing Yesterday Morning to Handle Urgent Relief in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Commission, was deeply saddened by the heavy casualties caused by the indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing by [unclear] aircraft. He flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing yesterday (6th) morning at around 2:00 a.m., arriving at noon, to carry out relief work.

<h3>Promote the Culture of Resistance The Current Cartoon Exhibition Opens Today Public Exhibition in the Lobby of the Central Theatre More Than Twenty Artists Contribute More Than Fifty Works</h3>
<p>The Modern Chinese Cartoon Exhibition, which was previewed in Hong Kong on the 30th of last month, was well received. It is reported that the exhibition will be officially opened today in the lobby of the Central Theatre on Queen's Road. There are more than 50 large cloth paintings on display, contributed by more than 20 well-known artists from home and abroad, including Zhang Leping, Long Zhili, Te Wei, Mai Zhao, Ye Qianyu, Li Fanfu, Zhang Guangyu, Zhang Zhengyu, Lin Qin, Huang Ding, Ding Cong, Chen Xianqi, Li Binghong, Lin Jing, and Huang Huanwu. All of the works depict various forms of the sacred War of Resistance. Although they are only part of the achievements of the past year, they can already give a glimpse of the general attitude of Chinese artists engaged in cultural warfare.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Complies with the Situation and Guarantees the Tenants Law Extends the Implementation Period to June 1, 1940 The Attorney General's Revised Draft Will be Submitted to the Legislative Council for Approval</h3>
<p>Regarding the Hong Kong government's measures to protect tenants, the authorities enacted the 1938 Eviction of Tenants Ordinance last year, limited to one year, and June 1 will be the expiration date. In March, the reporter obtained from semi-official sources that the Hong Kong government, in view of the fact that there have been no major changes in the situation and that the housing problem for residents remains serious, is awaiting the government's continued legal protection, and therefore has the intention to extend the term of this ordinance for another year. At that time, Chinese representative Luo Wenjin also stated that any government with a good political structure will extend the effective term of this ordinance, because the severity of the housing problem when the ordinance was first promulgated was no different from the present. This matter has attracted the close attention of people in society, who are eager for the authorities to extend the term of the ordinance. Yesterday, the Hong Kong Government Gazette published a draft amendment to the ordinance signed by Attorney General [name unclear] Yian, requesting that the effective term of the ordinance be extended to June 1, 1940. In that case, the general public in Hong Kong who are oppressed by some unscrupulous landlords will have more legal protection from the authorities in the coming year. According to the draft ordinance, the 1938 Ordinance on Eviction of Tenants, as amended by the 1939 Ordinance on Eviction of Tenants, is now re-enacted and amended, and will be approved by the Governor of Hong Kong and agreed to by the Legislative Council to be effectively implemented. The amended articles are as follows: (1) This ordinance may be called the 1939 Eviction of Tenants Amendment Ordinance No. 3. (2) Section 8 of the 1938 Eviction of Tenants Ordinance is re-enacted as Section 8 of the 1939 Eviction of Tenants Amendment Ordinance, changing "June 1, 1939" to "June 1, 1940." As for the purpose and reasons for the amendment, there are the following two: (1) Section 8 of the 1938 Eviction of Tenants Ordinance, which is re-enacted as Section 8 of the 1939 Amendment Ordinance on Eviction of Tenants, stipulates that the effective term of this ordinance shall expire on June 1, 1939, and shall not be exceeded unless otherwise amended in this ordinance. (2) The purpose of this draft is to extend the effective term of this ordinance by two years.</p>

<h3>A Harmonious Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Yuqian</p>
<p>……Regarding the joint performance of "Huanghuagang"……</p>
<p>Under the principle and goal of resisting the war and building the nation, theatrical workers should unite sincerely and complete their great mission. No one can deny this. Therefore, this joint performance of "Huanghuagang" is of extremely significant meaning. However, joint performances are the most difficult thing to handle. I have participated in two or three joint performances elsewhere before, and none of them proceeded as smoothly as this one.</p>
<p>This time, it was originally scheduled to be staged on March 29th, but due to problems with rehearsals, roles, stage performance and ticket sales, and theater negotiations, it was extended to now - May 3rd, when it was performed at the Taiping Theater. Although the time was delayed and it did not correspond to the March 29th scene, the significance of this joint performance is not simply limited to holding a memorial ceremony on a certain day, but to publicize the historical traces of the revolution, to let people know the difficulty of creating the country, and how we should follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and maintain its glory. The seventy-two martyrs did not die. The heroism of "Huanghuagang" will shine through the ages. We can commemorate it anytime, anywhere. This historical drama has absolutely no time limit.</p>
<p>This joint performance, at least for the most part, broke the situation of each acting on their own and not consulting with each other, demonstrating that the theatrical workers remaining in Hong Kong are standing on the same front line. Just look at the members of each participating theater group, all of them are joining together with twelve points of enthusiasm to form a strong whole, and watching their entire work, revealing excitement and joy. There is no jealousy, no idle talk, only upward progress in work. Moreover, the most valuable thing is that no one used any method or means to organize, but completely automatically united and pushed forward. Based on this spirit, continued efforts can overcome any obstacle. This is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>This performance also went through many difficulties. Just the costumes alone took a lot of effort, and there were countless troubles in many other things, but there were no personnel disputes. This shows the great progress of Chinese youth.</p>
<p>This play uses a lot of actors, and there are several crowd scenes, which are quite difficult to handle. In addition, these crowd actors are played by several different non-professional theater groups, so it is even more difficult. Some friends thought that at least the first day of the performance would be chaotic and unbearable, but unexpectedly it was neat and lively, which shows that the director handled it well. What cannot be ignored is that the young comrades who played the crowd are unusually sincere, so they can get very pleasant cooperation. Especially those groups organized by workers, they are not only on time, but also know the lyrics the earliest. How inspiring this is!</p>
<p>Precisely because so many people are used and they do not perform regularly, all the troubles that joint performances should have are indeed worrying; but in the course of work, one does train oneself. When rehearsing on the dance floor of the Taiping Theater on the afternoon of May 3rd, everyone was worried. A group of workers were extremely busy. The stage installers stayed up all night the night before and did not eat for another day, rushing to put up the scenery. The people in charge of costumes, makeup, and lighting also had no chance to sit down. The directors looked at each other silently, and it seemed that they did not have full confidence in success. Mr. Hu Chunbing, in addition to rehearsing the play, rushed to write many articles for the special issue overnight, with a sleepless, greenish face, constantly walking back and forth, and contacting many people.</p>
<p>The curtain opened, and the play progressed scene by scene. Everyone also gradually put down the stones in their hearts. Serious and tense faces gradually showed smiles. The emotions on stage and the emotions off stage became one, rising to the peak. The audience listened silently, with concentrated and attentive expressions, and the applause that erupted at the end and the slogans echoing the characters in the play gave everyone infinite courage. After the play was over, everyone was exhausted, but after one thing was accomplished, they unconsciously felt a kind of intoxicated joy. This kind of joy, I have directed so many plays since coming to Hong Kong, and I feel that it is the first time I have obtained it. True happiness must come from work!</p>
<p>Of course, the script of "Huanghuagang" still has a few minor points that can be discussed, and the next rerun will definitely be more organized. As for all the actors, some have rich stage experience, and some have only been on stage once or twice, but they cooperate harmoniously, and there is no desire for any particular role to be particularly good or particularly bad. Moreover, those actors who play the crowd and party members naturally reveal their inner passion, which is very moving, exceeding their technical cultivation. This is particularly worth pointing out.</p>
<p>This joint performance of "Huanghuagang" not only proves that the Hong Kong theater community has united under the same goal, but also proves that many young people have broken down the barriers of guilds and factions and achieved pure unity. How touching this is!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>A Living Record of Drama · A Special Feature on the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiang</p>
<p>The Chinese national revolutionary war is a great epic that will never perish, and it is also a great drama that shakes the world. This epic, this drama, is written by gathering the lives of millions of Chinese people, gathering the heads and hot blood of millions of soldiers, and an indestructible spirit. No matter how many poets and dramatists' ideals and activities have been throughout history, they cannot compare to the greater performance manifested by the sacred war in this era and at this stage. Because it is the historical struggle that makes a group of violent murderers and robbers in the world - fascist aggressors - surrender, allows many groups of people who love peace and freedom to win survival, and gives birth to a new era. This struggle is the narrative of a great poem and the performance of a great drama. — The Special Feature on the War of Resistance is one chapter of a living drama record. Since before and after the full-scale War of Resistance broke out the year before last, the China Film Studio has begun to operate, mobilizing Lei film workers in the front and rear to record all the real situations. This is an extremely important task, and its importance is like the weapons and food needed in the front. It is a spiritual weapon and food, transported to support our compatriots at home and abroad, and international friends who care about the safety of this nation.</p>
<p>The Special Feature on the War of Resistance, from volumes one to five, has been released in Hong Kong one after another, each time bringing extremely valuable and rich materials. Now, volume six has also been released in Hong Kong, and the materials are also extremely rich. The recording time of this volume is particularly long, from before the retreat from Wuhan to the present day, which includes the transitional period from the first to the second stage of the War of Resistance. People who have seen volumes one to five can make a comprehensive comparison after seeing volume six. When the first few volumes were released, although we could see the bravery of the warriors and the hardship of the people, we also saw countless weaknesses; but volume six showed a rapid progress in the transitional period of the War of Resistance, which made us have new impressions and new expectations for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The orderly retreat from Wuhan, the efforts of the people to assist the government authorities, the plans and confident deployments of the military, etc., are obviously different from what was seen in the previous volumes, indicating clear progress. A year ago, in the first volume, we saw the disguised Wang Jingwei enthusiastically and pretentiously playing the expression of his patriot and old revolutionary party, and expressing those unfulfilled and irresponsible remarks, but in volume six, this kind of character is no longer seen. Only President Chiang Kai-shek and the majority of military and political leaders who are unyielding and insist on a protracted war of resistance are in the Nanyue Conference in volume six, and they are always consistent, doing their best to carry out the great plan of resisting the war and building the nation. In addition, there are also scenes of civilians in the rear rescuing wounded soldiers, and our army treating wounded soldiers well, and educating prisoners. We clearly see the suffering of soldiers and people in the rear, but volume six records that the people do not give up because of this kind of suffering. On the contrary, they are more willing to see the strengthening of the people's hatred of the enemy, and their firm belief in future victory, when the conspiracy of the traitors to take advantage of the people's suffering as an excuse to seek peace is shattered. Although some of the materials in the entire volume were photographed months ago, and seem to be a little too slow in terms of reporting significance, this situation is of course because the China Film Studio also withdrew west to Chongqing during the retreat from Wuhan, and re-organized and edited it. This was delayed for some time, but the authenticity and richness of the materials in the film will not reduce its value and significance.</p>

<h3>The Joint Relief Association of All Circles Urgently Requests the National Salvation Drama Troupe to Perform a Benefit Performance on a Large Scale in Late May</h3>
<p>Since the China National Salvation Drama Troupe prepared to go abroad to promote national salvation, and arrived in Hong Kong last month, because of their efforts and remarkable achievements in various parts of the country in the past, they have been warmly welcomed by various cultural groups, women's groups, etc. in Hong Kong, causing a sensation for a time. Now, the Hong Kong Joint Conference of All Circles for the Relief of Chinese Refugees, admiring the troupe's dramatic art, and in order to expand publicity and raise funds to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees, has decided to urgently request the troupe to give a large-scale fundraising benefit performance for the association before going abroad, which will be held in a certain large theater in late May. In addition to actively rehearsing various great anti-war dramas, the troupe has also begun to produce magnificent scenery and lighting. It is believed that the significance of this performance, the artistic essence, the grandeur of the scenery, and the wonderful lighting will break any theater troupe's performance record. In addition to the theater rent, all scenery and performance expenses will be borne by the troupe, which is an unprecedented and meaningful feat in the Hong Kong theater community!</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Historical Facts of "Huanghuagang"</h3>
<p>— Pan Jie'an</p>
<p>In order to give the general public a deep and universal understanding of the prelude to the Xinhai national founding revolution and the heroic deeds of the "Seventy-Two Martyrs" who attacked Guangzhou, so as to commemorate the Huanghua Festival; at the same time, in order to raise some money to comfort the families of the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, so as to make the commemoration of the Huanghua Festival more meaningful, the Hong Kong Relief Association General Assembly finally accepted the proposal of the Hong Kong drama troupes and staged the great historical drama of the seventy-two people who were buried in Huanghuagang and heroically sacrificed their lives for the country.</p>
<p>Now that the performance has been realized, when the author's yearning for the fruits of this great contribution can really be realized little by little, we naturally have unspeakable ten thousand points of joy; at the same time, the author's many concerns about the arrangement and textual research of this great historical event on that day have also been unfortunately confirmed.</p>
<p>Because of the heavy workload, I didn't even have time to buy and read the script, so I only relied on considerable faith—after more than 20 drama writers' work, and many cultural people's arrangement and review—while waiting for this unprecedented performance.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this great performance, as Mr. Hu Chunbing said, has already "organized a subject matter that is difficult to grasp and even more difficult to handle into a script that has flesh and blood, soul, modern meaning, and can be coordinated with the current politics." Whether in the art itself, the anti-war propaganda, especially in the united front of war drama workers and the effect of self-education, it has already laid its considerable results. However, the problem lies in this "difficult to grasp and even more difficult to handle." When the author saw the end, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh and say "difficult"!</p>
<p>As for the concentration of the central force of the drama, it has been done to the best of its ability; as for the fixation of the authenticity of the facts and the retention of more important materials, the author has his own opinions on this, and would like to put them forward for discussion, but because of time, space, and the search for historical facts, they cannot be allowed, so I have to put forward the more easily changed ones, which also belong to the outline, for discussion with everyone.</p>
<p>Here, please talk about three areas: Wen Shengcai. After assassinating Fuqi, it would be best if he could be entangled by a patrol police officer after escaping, and Wen voluntarily disarmed and surrendered to be arrested. This not only conforms to the real fact that Martyr Wen said to the patrol police officer that day: "We are all Chinese people, don't kill compatriots!" It also fully shows Martyr Wen's courage and the great spirit of loving his own race.</p>
<p>The second and third counties. Regarding the issue of postponing the date, according to the old comrades, Chen Jingbo's proposition was a traitor, Hu Yisheng's proposition was too persistent, and Chen Jiongming's was a kind of concern and restraint (which was probably related to the council), and Yao Yu's was to wait clearly. Everyone had different psychological states. However, the performance did not show them one by one, nor did it give any hint of who was good or bad. Naturally, everyone excluded Chen Jingbo. Third, Huang Keqiang's "suicide" after being forced to issue the order to postpone the date is superfluous here in terms of the form of the performance. Of course, because this suicide issue has been discussed by many people; Ba Jin, Mao Dun, etc. believe that Huang felt sorry for the overseas comrades and for Mr. Sun, and had to die to thank them; however, we should know that with Huang's life and qualifications as the leader of the Changjiang secret society for many years, the idea of suicide would not arise in their minds at all. His so-called death to report to the Hong Kong planning department was to imitate Shi Jianru. Wen Shengcai and others sacrificed their lives by fighting alone, so he wanted to rush out and fight Li Zhun after being angry and frustrated. There is no need to have suicidal thoughts and then change his mind to fight.</p>
<p>(2) Use of Names and Terms</p>
<p>It is really nothing to find out the shortcomings of this performance; however, the above-mentioned details show many shortcomings. There are many examples that cannot be remembered, so I will only write down the most important ones; in the prologue, Fuqi is a Manchu, not a Han official. He is loyal to their "Manchu" family and "Manchu" race, but Wen Shengcai laughs and scolds: "Killing one more traitor and one more slave, China can have one less pest!" The biggest mistake in this chest is that Fuqi is not a "Han" traitor, so Wen's scolding is equivalent to not knowing what he is talking about. Moreover, Fuqi's position is General, called Governor, or Master, and whether subordinates or anyone else, they all call him "Commander"; but regardless of Wen Shengcai, or even his subordinate "Commander", he actually calls him a Fu "General." He is not surnamed "Fu," and who would dare to directly call the surname and name of a member of the imperial family? In the second scene, Lin Juemin's wife is actually called Mrs. Lin by comrades. Of course, Juemin's identity and name are problematic. Even if that were the case, how could revolutionaries call her "Mrs." in the same tone as a Manchu slave? This is a bit that! In the third scene, Huang Keqiang and Xu Zonghan actually talk about "love." Isn't this like a Song dynasty person looking up the "Kangxi Dictionary"? Because there was no "love" title at that time. As for the Kuomintang at that time, it was not reorganized and was still the Chinese Revolutionary Party. The name of the premier was not established (established after the Kuomintang-Communist joint in the 13th year of the Republic of China). Even the general party members only called Sun Yat-sen "Mr." without mentioning his surname or name. Qing officials never called them revolutionaries, but directly called them bandits or rebellious parties. This is most in line with what Zhang Mingqi's staff said. It is also incorrect for Qing officials to say that an uprising is a "revolt." It is most appropriate for the staff to say "rebellion" when interrogating party members. This is the most important thing, and other details cannot be listed.</p>
<p>(3) Costumes and Makeup</p>
<p>This is also a military matter. The disguise must be authentic—the most confusing thing here is Zhang Mingqi's long beard. According to what I know and what friends and relatives in Guangzhou at the time said, Zhang was the youngest of the Qing Dynasty governors. He was about 39 years old when he was governor, and at most 41 or 42 in the years of Hai and Xin. Where did he get such a two- or three-inch-long "Gan Zhongsi" thing? Moreover, Zhang was a handsome man. People said that he had a beautiful concubine mother who was always with Zhang. Watching him that night, he was about to die. Second, Chen Jiongming's behavior in the party was always undesirable, but everyone knew one or two about his simplicity. His blue cloth gown in the council era and his gray cloth gown after the uprising can represent his rank. However, Chen actually put on a gorgeous silk gown and added a vest that Guan officials in Xiguan did not have. This made the author dare not believe that it was him if Keqiang had not called him Jiongming.</p>
<p>The above briefly expresses my personal opinions for everyone to discuss. Because of the rush of time, if everyone is very happy, we can talk about it later when we have time.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The performance of "Huanghuagang" promoted strong cooperation in the theater community and enthusiastic resonance from the audience. However, we also want to discuss technical issues. This is necessary to expand the field of drama. Mr. Pan's article is just the beginning of a discussion. In addition to asking the gentlemen of the "Huanghuagang" directing team to be responsible for answering questions, we also hope that readers will actively participate in the discussion.</p>
<h3>The 741st Performance</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>On the second evening, Xuzhou City was still immersed in darkness. The wind and sand hit the windows of our house in gusts, and all the glass was broken by shrapnel.</p>
<p>In the morning, we wrote several news reports, one of which was published in the Xuzhou Min Guo Daily, describing what methods we would take in the future to perform dramas in rural battlefields and other places without stages, and how to achieve the effect of propaganda among the vast public. In the afternoon, we arranged the small auditorium; a small colored cloth was hung in front of the curtain. Three screens were arranged on the stage, which was all of our stage equipment.</p>
<p>More and more people came, filling the temporary small theater. There was no light, and the audience waited in the dark for the opening.</p>
<p>Backstage, on the narrow aisle, there was a table and a few long wooden benches. All of us were squeezed together, busy with makeup under the dim candlelight. Everyone roughly drew the characters with brushes and lead powder.</p>
<p>Donglin (played by Jinshan), who was extremely vicious in "Since September 18th"</p>
<p>At about 8 o'clock, the lights came on and the program began. "Dear Comrades," the blue curtain was opened, and applause and speeches were carried out enthusiastically at the same time. We explained the significance of coming to Xuzhou this time, and told the audience that we were going to abandon the road of drama we had taken in the past, and open up a new road in the War of Resistance—to use drama as a weapon of propaganda to participate in the War of Resistance. Finally, we said: "If there is an air raid alarm, because there are too many people, please do not go outside the theater. All of us will sit on the stage and talk with you and tell stories."</p>
<p>The curtain closed and then opened.</p>
<p>Living Newspaper "Defend the Motherland"</p>
<p>Prologue, allegorical drama "Since September 18th": In the Northeast, a peaceful and happy family, the whole family is living in harmony. One day, a Donglin, who is full of kindness, co-existence and co-prosperity, suddenly broke in and forcibly took away the eldest daughter (the three northeastern provinces). Just as the whole family was sad and indignant, the short and vicious neighbor, greedy and unscrupulous, then snatched away the second daughter (Rehe); at this time, the father and son felt that peace was at the mercy of others, and they were determined to defend themselves. If he comes again, I will definitely drive him out! The father said in grief and indignation. As a result, when the neighbor came to snatch the third daughter (Pingjin), the whole family united and resisted unanimously, and finally drove Donglin out of this peaceful family. At the end of the curtain, the audience shouted loudly: Completely drive ×× out of China!</p>
<p>Act 1: The night before "August 13th", representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai and Mayor Yu Hongjun were meeting at the city government. Each representative expressed their determination to resist, "We are all prepared," they said. The clock stopped pointing at 3:50, ten minutes away from the final time limit; the electric bell rang, it was ××'s final time-limited reply. When the mayor took the telephone receiver to prepare to speak, a collective roar was emitted from behind the curtain: No Surrender! No Surrender! There were our comrades in the audience responding, and as a result, the audience also shouted: No Surrender! No Surrender!, the stage and the audience roared together, Mayor Yu said simply and powerfully into the telephone receiver: We will give you a reply at 4 o'clock.</p>
<p>Act 2: The Eight Character Bridge in Shanghai, the flag of Blue Sky, White Sun and Whole Earth is majestically flying in front of the trenches, the brothers are quietly aiming, the officer is looking at the watch, 3:56, 57... One minute after another passed, and at 4 o'clock, a loud noise, sparks erupted, the brothers bravely rushed out of the trenches, and the bugle of Wei Feng was sounding sadly.</p>
<p>Act 3: Place a loudspeaker in front of the closed blue curtain; first report the name of the radio station, and then broadcast the Supreme Leader's Lushan Declaration to the audience in an impassioned form. The venue was very quiet, and the faces of the audience were filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Note: The actors who played the eldest daughter, second daughter, and third daughter sewed a piece of white cloth on their backs with the words—Three Northeastern Provinces——Jehol——Tianjin——etc. to symbolize these places, but they were not allowed to be seen by the audience when they were taken away by Donglin. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>After the "Huanghuagang" Performance</h3>
<p>— By Si Conghuimin</p>
<p>…A salute to the great successes within many failures…</p>
<p>Theater</p>
<p>If judged from a purely technical or aesthetic standpoint, perhaps this performance of "Huanghuagang" could be deemed a failure, as there were many unrefined shortcomings in the script and the acting. However, we can also see great successes within many failures: we can observe the audience's soaring emotions, the unified response between the stage and the audience, and the extremely full realization of the effect that "Huanghuagang" aimed to achieve. This performance of "Huanghuagang" has undoubtedly established an unprecedented beacon for wartime theater movements in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the depth of emotion felt by the audience was also unprecedented in Hong Kong. I was moved by this kind of passionate fervor and, like the audience, forgot about the shortcomings of the performance, deeply respecting the efforts of the comrades involved.</p>
<p>This performance involved theater groups from all over Hong Kong, with over 300 backstage and front-of-house staff participating. This is not only unprecedented in Hong Kong but also rare in the history of Chinese theater movements. I recall that after the July 7th Incident occurred the year before last, playwrights in Shanghai also swiftly created a play script to defend Lugou Bridge and launched a joint performance by all Shanghai theater practitioners on the eve of the August 13th Incident. This event was a significant stimulus to the theater scene at the time. Who would have known that just over twenty months later, Hong Kong, previously considered a barren land for wartime theater, would also experience a similar, great stimulus in the theater world. Generally speaking, the collective effort of many individuals and groups is powerful and effective. However, on the other hand, the more groups and people involved, the easier it is for the work to become chaotic. Before the performance, I was concerned for the comrades working on this project, not to mention the pre-production, rehearsals, and various stage setups. With so many people on stage and such a tight performance schedule, the work backstage and front-of-house during the run would be troublesome enough. But the facts proved my worries unfounded. The performance showed us that it was conducted in a very orderly and planned manner. The transitions of actors, scenes, and set changes were all handled smoothly. Apart from the slightly longer transition time from Act III to Act IV, the rest were at most fifteen minutes, with the fastest being ten minutes. Given the limitations of the less-than-perfect facilities, this was already very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The entire performance lasted from 8:15 PM to 12:00 AM, a total of more than three and a half hours. For a play with four acts and six scenes and a considerable amount of dialogue, this performance time was appropriate. This indicates that the performance was able to harness the advantages of teamwork while overcoming the shortcomings mentioned earlier. Deep respect should be extended to all those who participated in this work, especially those working backstage and front-of-house!</p>
<p>Based on what I saw on the first day, there were still many shortcomings, but there should be some improvements in the following two days. Now, I will offer a brief opinion based solely on the situation on the first day, hoping that theater comrades will provide corrections and supplements:</p>
<p>The prologue was relatively well-rehearsed in the entire play, and the set and lighting were good. Unfortunately, due to the shallow stage depth, the backdrop was too close, and the lighting for the scenery and the front of the stage could not be adequately arranged. The scenery on both sides obstructed the actors' performance. Among the actors, the one playing the Wei army commander, Nuchao, was better, while the others, such as Xi Feng playing Huang Xiayi and Mo Yan playing Passerby B, were also very diligent. The roles of the honor guards and Wei soldiers were too casual, somewhat resembling the "extra" roles on the opera stage. This was a significant flaw in the performance and ruined the theatrical effect. Throughout the play, many actors playing crowd scenes and similar roles made the same mistake. This situation may be due to the allocation of roles or negligence during rehearsals, or perhaps it is due to the actors' own misconceptions about the concept of collective activity in theater. In old-fashioned theater, the focus was often on the acting skills of a certain individual, with other roles serving as supporting characters. However, this misunderstanding cannot be retained in new theater. Everything on stage, every character that appears, regardless of their position or time on stage, is deeply connected to the entire performance. If a part is neglected, it is equivalent to neglecting the whole. This is a very common and easily made mistake.</p>
<p>Huang Zongbao, played by Wen Shengcai, worked hard, but it seems that his personality was not entirely appropriate for portraying this national hero of Huanghuagang. As soon as Wen Shengcai appeared, he looked like a fierce and somewhat inhumane traitor, as seen when he collided with Passerby B upon entering. If the intention was to portray someone whose personality had become abnormal due to extreme persecution and stimulation, it should only be a certain degree of irritability, stubbornness, and resentment. However, for someone like Wen Shengcai, a sense of justice and chivalry must be expressed, which was not achieved. Perhaps this was due to the script. The assassination and arrest scene was a failure. The fight between Wen Shengcai and the Wei soldiers was so perfunctory that the audience laughed at the most tense moment. Furthermore, the sound effects were not properly utilized during the assassination, which were all factors contributing to the failure.</p>
<p>The arrangement of characters and stage activity in the first act were very appropriate. However, the pace of the second half of the act was not appropriately rehearsed. Actors such as Huang Ninglin playing Yu Peilun, Wang Keng playing Yao Yuping, Xu Guoyu playing Fang Shengdong, and Lu Dun playing Huang Kecheng were all very good, and each character's personality was expressed quite clearly. Li Chenfeng, who played Lin Juemin, was slightly lacking. For someone as passionate and witty as Lin Juemin, there was not enough emotion felt in the entire performance, especially in the section where he recounted past events with suppressed pain after Mrs. Lin left. The atmosphere of terror in the scene of the Qing officials' search was insufficient. The movements of the party members indoors were forced. In the moment when Zong Han opened the door and the officials entered the room to search, the people inside showed no startled reaction. The dangerous key moment arranged in the script, the revealing of the list of party members, was not well executed in terms of visualization and timing.</p>
<p>The scene in the second act was well-positioned, but unfortunately, it lacked splendor. Of course, this was due to the limitations of economic conditions. The alternation of events in the entire act was not clear, and the tension was not as strong as it should have been, which was the biggest shortcoming. The scene where the maid teased the servant A in the first part was not well-rehearsed, so it became a burden and did not achieve the desired effect. After Ying Bosheng entered and reported, the pace of the play's development should have sharply increased, but due to the slow movements of the actors and their lack of familiarity with the lines, the transition was significant. Zhang Chishan, who played Zhang Mingqi, did not move quickly enough, and his lines were not very fluent. Deng Zhujun, who played Zhang's concubine, lacked naturalness in her performance, with many movements being too vulgar. Jiang Ming, Qiu Xinghai, and others who have always played important roles in the China Arts Theater only played extremely unimportant roles such as male servants in this performance. Breaking the old notions without considering the status of professional theater troupes, this attitude and this work ethic are very commendable.</p>
<p>The lighting change and set design in the third act were the best in the entire play. The positions of the characters and the stage activity were also quite appropriate. At the beginning, the movements of the characters in the dark room and the tones of their lines were not properly coordinated with the atmosphere of the stage. The performers seemed to be working just as hard as in the first act. In terms of the play's development, this act should have gradually accelerated and heightened until the brief pause in the play's tension when the debate over postponing the date was hesitant and unresolved. The director probably attempted to achieve this effect, but it failed due to the performers' lack of familiarity with their movements and lines. In the scene where Huang Kecheng announced the postponement amid conflicting emotions and then retracted it, the inner pain, disappointment, and impulsiveness of Kecheng were not visually effective enough. Qu Ai, who played Xu Zonghan, was not stern enough in her performance in the scene where she persuaded Kecheng, and she also seemed to lack genuine emotion. The ending of this act achieved a good effect, but unfortunately, the actors' tones were not strong enough, and they did not elevate the lines and the audience's emotions in unison.</p>
<p>The fourth act was performed the worst, mostly due to the script. I remember the shortcomings I saw in the Guangzhou performance last year are still present, especially in the part about attacking the governor's office later on. It was simply chaotic. The audience's emotions were not stirred up but rather became indifferent, and some places were so perfunctory that the audience burst into laughter. Furthermore, there were many shortcomings in various aspects. The stage atmosphere in the scene where Chen Gengxin and Rao Guoying were interrogated lacked a sense of terrifying pressure. Zhang Mingqi should not have been smiling during the interrogation. It was absolutely necessary to avoid the soldiers spraying water to awaken Rao, as this would cause the audience to laugh with counter-effect. Zhang Mingqi's performance when he left the court was too exaggerated. The conversation between the soldiers about the revolutionaries that followed interrupted the tense atmosphere. The scene where the revolutionaries broke into the hall was not enthusiastic enough. The lines, sound effects, and movements were not organically interwoven. The positions and movements of the extras were not appropriately arranged, and there were too few of them. These were all shortcomings that caused the fourth act to lose a great deal of theatrical impact.</p>
<p>The epilogue was, of course, the decisive moment of the entire play. Zhong Qinan's speech, the speeches of the soldiers and young audience members, moved the audience's emotions word by word. The performers responded to the audience's emotions with the most passionate and genuine feelings. This act can be said to have been a complete victory, a complete victory for Hong Kong theater.</p>
<p>The above are all my personal shallow opinions, and what I have discussed is only a very small part. There may be inappropriate places. I hope that theater comrades will provide corrections and supplements.</p>
<p>In short, the performance of "Huanghuagang" was indeed a great success within many failures. I hope that the theater practitioners staying in Hong Kong will cherish this valuable experience, improve its shortcomings, and make this large-scale, united performance a solid milestone in the progress of the theater movement!</p>

<h3>Baseball Game Worth Watching Today: Chinese Team Battles American Sailors; A Fierce Clash Is Inevitable When the Two Champions Meet Today; South China vs. Hong Kong Club Game Postponed</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM today, there will be an open baseball league game at Caroline Hill, with the Chinese team facing the USS Mindanao team. According to the original schedule, the second game was supposed to be between Hong Kong Club and South China Club. However, because South China's preparations were not yet complete, they requested a postponement, which was approved. It is rumored that baseball recorder Smith stated that South China may be able to field a team today for an exhibition game against Hong Kong Club. Whether this is true will be known at the time.</p>
<p>The Chinese team is the champion of last year's league and international competition. The Mindanao team is also a strong team. A fierce battle is inevitable when the two champions meet today. However, the lineups of both teams have changed this year. Some good players from the Chinese team have left. Coach Liu Dacheng is currently far away in Honolulu, catcher Luo William is studying in the South, third baseman Chen Lianyao is on Rhodes Island, and Huang Guoqing is also studying abroad. This year's strength seems to be less than last year's peak. However, the team is organized by overseas Chinese from various places and will not suffer from a lack of talent. Recently, there have been rumors that players from Canada and Honolulu will participate, so repeating as champions in the future is well within expectations. It is said that the players who will play today will be Huang Jun, Chen Lunying, Lin Ye, Chen Fang, Zhong Cansen, Cai Bingfen, Hu Zhengqu, Zheng Limen, Chen Lian, Lu Jiaxing, etc.</p>
<p>The Mindanao team also has a group of good players. Pitcher Lu Ailu fills the role of catcher, and his skills are high. Others such as Zha Shi and Ma Shi are all outstanding talents. The team's roster is listed below:</p>
<p>USS Mindanao</p>
<p>(Pitcher) Ailu (Catcher) Tan Mashi, Zha Shi, (First Base) De Jilishi, (Second Base) Jia Yunuo or Zha Shi, (Shortstop) Mai Jinmi, (Third Base) Diao Shi, He Dun, (Left Field) Hu Yili, (Center Field) Qi Luchen, (Right Field) Ta Li, (Reserve) Du Chi,</p>
<p>Yesterday's Friend Beer Wins Over Occidental</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, the first game kicked off, with the Occidental Club playing against the Friend Beer team. Many Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen came to watch. Before the game, the two teams lined up. Li Anna (captain of the Friend Beer team) and A Luweishi (captain of the Occidental team) introduced the players to American Consul General Edison Yixiuda and Sir Shoushen respectively. Then, the American Consul performed the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>The Occidental Club's lineup lost Da Gaoshan Nu and Bi Lude, which had an impact on their offensive and defensive strength. However, those who started later all made progress and fought quite hard. In the first two innings, they were still able to compete evenly with Friend Beer. However, from the third inning onwards, due to several new players lacking experience, Friend Beer took the lead and soared upwards. Friend Beer eventually won 8-4.</p>
<p>Friend Beer is the incarnation of last year's Volunteer Army team. This year, they received sponsorship from the Friend Beer Brewery, and their equipment is complete and their uniforms are neat. They played with extra vigor. At the same time, T. Anna, who has over ten years of experience, filled the role of first base. Yesterday, countless opposing players died at his hands. In the last three innings, the defense was especially solid. The Chinese team should pay attention when they meet them in the future.</p>
<p>The Occidental Club got ten hits in total, and there were opportunities to score. Unfortunately, there were as many as six errors, which prevented them from winning. Instead, they allowed runners to be out. This was the main reason for the defeat. Friend Beer got eight hits and three errors. The ratio was better than the Occidental Club, but three errors in total is not a good sign for a strong team either. The names and scores of both teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Occidental Club</p>
<p>(Pitcher) Pala Ci, (Left Field) Ding A Luweili Shi, (First Base) Ba Luoshi, (Second Base) Wen Dusha, (Third Base) Bu Le Da, (Catcher) A. Luweishi, (Right Field) Fei Jialidu, (Center Field) Ma Kuishi, (Shortstop) A Luweishi,</p>
<p>Friend Beer Team</p>
<p>(Second Base) Susha, (Right Field) Shou Nabi Shi, (First Base) T. Li Anna (Shortstop) Li Anna, (Pitcher) Xia Gaoli, (Third Base) Xia Xian, (Left Field) Bei Shi, (Right Field) Bo Liannu, (Center Field) S. Li Anna, (Catcher) Rong Li,</p>
<p>Scores of Both Sides</p>
<p>Occidental 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 = 4</p>
<p>Inning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Total</p>
<p>Friend Beer 1 2 2 0 3 0 0 = 8</p>
<h3>Chinese Swimming Pool Opens Today</h3>

<h3>A Good Soccer Match Today: Eastern Battles Macao Team; Huang Wengui Helps Eastern; Meet at Hong Kong Club at 4:30 PM</h3>
<p>…This afternoon, there will be an exciting soccer match at the Hong Kong Club in Happy Valley. The Macao All-Stars team is coming to Hong Kong to play against the Eastern Club team, the runner-up in the First Division League. The game is scheduled to start at 4:30 PM. Tickets are priced at one dollar, fifty cents, and thirty cents. Previously issued honorary tickets are invalid (because these honorary tickets are limited to the league, and now that the league has ended, they are invalid. Reporters must enter with their business cards). Open at 3:00 to avoid crowding…</p>
<p>…Milo, the director of the Macao Football Association, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday afternoon and immediately visited Hong Kong Football Association and Eastern Club directors Schopfer and others. Matters relating to today's game have been properly discussed. He also stated that the Macao team is coming to Hong Kong with a determination to win. The Macao team has made significant progress in recent years, having drawn with the British Gordon team (1-1) and defeated the Philippine Intercity team and the Singapore Chinese team (both 2-0). They are confident in their strength and have much to offer. The last time they lost to the Hong Kong Intercity team was because the central Asian player Ashu was absent, forcing forward star Ga Laisu to retreat to midfield, which slightly affected both offense and defense. At the same time, Hong Kong goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai performed excellently, leaving no gaps to exploit, and they suffered defeat. This time, they guarantee to give Hong Kong soccer fans a good impression. Mr. Mi said this with considerable self-confidence, so he advised the Eastern players not to be overconfident and to be cautious in order to maintain the "Red Army" name…</p>
<p>…Eastern knows that "those who come are not kind" and have already prepared for battle. In addition to Zou Wenzhi returning to service, they have also invited the Chinese player Huang Wengui from the Police Club to help, creating a very complete lineup…</p>
<p>…This is the first time the Macao team has visited this year, so we do not know much about their skills. However, since they have the courage to come and challenge, they must be extraordinary and worth watching. It is expected that a lively scene will unfold at the time. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Macao All-Stars</p>
<p>Jia Hualu, Luo Badu, He Zhesheng, Ke Tuohua, Ya Luoshu, Susha, Xiao Luobishi, Ya Mai, Ji Lilu, Ga Laisu, Li Gu</p>
<p>(Reserves) Di Qing, Chang Da Lai Ge</p>
<p>Eastern Club</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Liu Xianhan, Zeng Zhongyun, Jiang Shanjing, Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shidu, Huang Wengui, Zou Wenzhi, Li Deqi, Wu Xiang, Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>(Reserves) Xu Bu, Yu Qiaoyu, Miao Huaguo, Li Tang,</p>

<h3>Friendly Soccer Match: South China Defeats Foreign Sailors; A Spirited Performance with a Score of 6-3</h3>
<p>The South China football team is preparing to head south for the campaign. To intensify training, a group of them went to the Caroline Hill stadium at 4:30 PM yesterday to compete with the British Navy's HMS Medway football team.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the South China players were all in high spirits and worked together. Although the foreign sailors tried to resist stubbornly, they were ultimately unable to shake our army in the slightest. As a result, South China won with a score of 6-3, achieving a great victory.</p>
<p>During the game, South China initially fielded Zhong Yongsen, Lin Depu, Xie Jinhong, and other players. Because their coordination was disorganized, there was nothing very exciting to see. Except for Shui Yi's goal seven minutes after the kickoff, thanks to Zhong Ye's wonderful pass, there were no further gains. This was all due to a lack of understanding and coordination.</p>
<p>Although Yongsen tried his best to perform yesterday, he lacked accuracy because he had not practiced for a long time. Jin Hai was somewhat satisfactory. Although Bei Hua was brave, he was not as formidable as he was in his prime. The two central defenders were only average. Zhao Zheng was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the second half, the situation changed quite a bit after Ying Qi, Genbao, and Bai Wei came on the field. The attack was sure to succeed, and the defense was as solid as a rock. The game was more exciting than in the first half. First, Ying Qi took advantage of Shui Yi's corner kick and headed the ball into the net. Then, Navy player Xisaludun scored a goal in the key area during a counterattack. In the blink of an eye, left midfielder Jiashouba charged forward and regained a goal, tying the score at 2-2.</p>
<p>A little later, Shui Yi got another opportunity and scored again. Jin Hai also added the finishing touches twice, creating a stable winning situation again. At this time, the foreign sailors seemed unwilling to lose and launched a large-scale attack. Finally, Gaolusi scored a long-range shot, and Yin Gelun and Xisaludun took the opportunity to put the ball into the net, making the score 5-3. South China still had the advantage. As the game was about to end, Ying Qi took advantage of Shui Yi's high pass and scored another goal, winning 6-3. The players from both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>South China Club (First Half)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng, Li Guo, Ruan Shu, Xie Jinhong, Lin Depu, Qingcai, Yang Shuiyi, Lu Dakeng, Zhang Jinhai, Ye Bei Hua, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>South China Club (Second Half)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng, Liang Baiwei, Ruan Shu, Li Guo, Liu Qingcai, Yang Genbao, Lu Dakeng, Jin Hai, Yingqi, Zhang Jinhai, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Medway Team</p>
<p>Chi, Chawen, Buluogan, Jia Hubo, Luo Aohua, Jia Lelu, Gelu Ling Shi, Yin Gelun, Jia Salupo, Gaolusi, Yan Shi Youdu</p>
<p>It is learned that South China will play against the Navy teams again next Tuesday and Thursday. Which team they will play against will be reported in the next issue.</p>
<h3>Two Former Chinese Soccer Stars Die in the Line of Duty in Lanzhou; Patriotic Heroes Fu Jiaxing and Ye Pengfei</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Many soccer fans will not forget the names Fu Jiaxing and Ye Pengfei. Six or seven years ago, they were admitted to the Guangzhou Aviation School to practice flying. After graduating, they served in the Air Force.</p>
<p>When the Chinese Sports Association soccer team was gradually declining, they joined the Chinese team along with Chen Ronghe and Xu Yahui, who were classmates, and shed a lot of blood and sweat on the soccer fields of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>At that time, soccer was also flourishing in Guangzhou. The Navy, Air Force, and Police teams were competing for supremacy. Fu and Ye were the mainstays of the Air Force team at that time.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Fu and Ye were ordered to transfer to Kunming for training and lived a hard-working life. They were passionate youths with a strong desire to serve the country. They thought that after training, they would be able to participate in the war, drive God-like planes and kill the enemy to fulfill their soaring ambitions.</p>
<p>Who would have known that their ambitions would not be realized before they died in the line of duty? The tragic news is saddening. Fu and Ye died in the line of duty in Lanzhou on a certain day last month.</p>
<p>The reason for their deaths was that they were practicing flying together in a plane, but for some reason, the plane crashed and fell from a high altitude. Thus, these two brave and promising flying heroes unfortunately perished with the plane. (Dong Lang)</p>

<p>Special Edition of the Modern Chinese Cartoon Exhibition</p>
<p>Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines - by Li Binghong</p>
<p>Three Generations of Guerrillas - by Ding Cong</p>
<h3>Starting with Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Li Fanfu</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has entered its second stage, and the responsibility borne by us cartoonists can be said to be growing heavier day by day. Chairman Chiang has hinted to us that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the ideological war is more important than the military war. Therefore, the expansion and intensification of cultural work is an inevitable path from now on!</p>
<p>Today, as we intensify cultural work to strengthen the ideological war, the demand for cartoons will become more urgent. In the past, education in China has not been popularized, so there are many illiterate people! Propaganda through words will feel quite difficult. To solve this difficulty, cartoons have this power. To stimulate the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people, to enhance the people's belief in victory, to promote the spirit of the people, and to raise the people's awareness, cartoons can go where written propaganda cannot. It can penetrate into the people, and it can make even the illiterate feel fond of it and understand its meaning.</p>
<p>China has been resisting for twenty-one months. The invaders are heading towards the grave, but we are heading towards the bright path. Final victory is absolutely certain. Although in the past twenty months, we have sacrificed many hot-blooded heroes and given up many towns and cities, the deeper the invaders go, the deeper their feet sink into the mud. Our current difficulties are precisely the harvest of the future—and we knew about these difficulties from the beginning of the War of Resistance. We will never change our established plan for the War of Resistance because of the current difficulties. Only the insane and cowardly would utter any talk of peace in the midst of this final victory. Precisely because some people are uttering talk of peace, our responsibility is all the more heavy. Therefore, at this critical moment of life and death, we cartoonists, in this turbulent era, can only work harder! Work harder! Work harder! Until the fascist Japanese army is driven out of Chinese territory!</p>
<p>Exile - by Mai Fei</p>
<h3>Let Us Learn from the Cartoonist Raemaekers!</h3>
<p>— Huang Ding</p>
<p>To go back to the time of the European War, when the unarmed Belgian merchant ship *Lusitania* was sunk by a German submarine in the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds of children who were about to be taken to safety were killed tragically at the hands of the invaders. They could not see their parents, they could not see their beloved toys, they lay quietly on the deck of a corpse-retrieval ship, large and small, and the sailors arranged their bodies on both sides, waiting for the heartbroken people to come and claim their beloved children. What a tragic scene it was! The anti-aggression painter Raemaekers sincerely depicted this cartoon, so that everyone who saw it was moved, and people with children wept when they saw it.</p>
<p>Raemaekers was very sympathetic to Belgium, which was invaded by the German army at the time, but he was just an unknown Dutch cartoonist. Because he hated war and the atrocities of the invaders, he expressed his passion for human love in his own works. As his immortal cartoons were printed in newspapers in the Netherlands, the propaganda effect of cartoons against aggression quickly penetrated the eyes and hearts of just and fair people all over the world. Therefore, newspapers and magazines in countries that upheld justice reprinted the works of this great cartoonist in the shortest possible time, and Raemaekers' name spread throughout Europe and the United States, and he received the most sublime praise. The *Times* praised him as "the greatest war writer in Europe or America." This is very accurate.</p>
<p>Raemaekers' achievements are entirely due to his noble feelings and his righteous conscience. At the same time, he also had particularly skilled painting techniques. He was very faithful and did not compromise on the form of things. Every one of his cartoons had his soul, and everyone, young and old, was moved by them. His technique is an extremely faithful and simple expression. His depiction of the atrocities of the German army in Belgium at that time is completely a true record. Witnesses in the British court would swear to his published collections, saying: "Honest, completely honest, and nothing but honest." From this sentence, we can see Raemaekers' attitude towards drawing.</p>
<p>He not only left an indelible impression in the minds of righteous people, but he also made those who were satirized feel uneasy. He once wrote a cartoon called "Innocent Slaughter," which depicted the ghosts of many children and women who were killed by the German army appearing in the blurry smoke, surrounding Emperor Wilhelm, the main culprit of the war, causing Wilhelm II, who heard the voice of justice, to feel terrified. This cartoon made Wilhelm feel the greatest shame, and he could only offer a reward of six thousand yuan to hunt down Raemaekers as a means of revenge, but Raemaekers had already moved to London at the time.</p>
<p>Raemaekers' greatness deserves a prominent place in the history of the European War, and his sublime artistic soul is what we deeply admire! His spirit of fighting for human justice is what we should learn!</p>
<p>China is now being ravaged by the invaders. The suffering that China is suffering today is probably no less cruel than that suffered by Belgium during the European War. Today, the aggressors who are oppressing China are believed to be even more brutal than Germany during the European War! The Chinese people have all risen up to resist. However, what we currently lack is someone like Raemaekers who can faithfully record the atrocities of the invaders.</p>
<p>Chinese cartoonists! Do you want to be a Raemaekers?</p>
<h3>Strengthen the Power of the Intellectual War</h3>
<p>— Lin Chen</p>
<p>Resistance is the Only Way Out - by Chen Yanqiao</p>
<p>According to military experts, the determination of a war depends on three conditions: armaments, money, and personnel. However, the morale that controls the entire war is even more powerful than these. If your armaments are complete, your money is abundant, and your personnel are sufficient, but you lack the morale of war, then you will definitely be the victim of this war. Therefore, some people say: intellectual war is actually more important than material war.</p>
<p>Looking at the wars in history, there are countless examples of success due to intellectual war. The success of the Russian October Revolution and Kemal's rebuilding of Turkey are both good examples. As long as we apply it properly, a pen may be more powerful than a gun.</p>
<p>In China today, we need international understanding on the outside and the people's understanding on the inside. Pictorial propaganda is more effective and profound than written propaganda. "Cartoons" have thus become a powerful sentinel in the intellectual war. Since the War of Resistance, cartoonists have unanimously focused their pens on the internal organs of the invaders, clearly narrating and frankly exposing them, making the Japanese, who are accustomed to lying and deceiving, extremely embarrassed. However, the cartoon movement may be a bit unfamiliar and has not yet gained the understanding of all our compatriots. Due to objective circumstances, the progress of this movement has been very slow. Does this mean that cartoonists have abandoned their mission? No, this is purely because the environment does not allow the cartoon field to grow independently, forcing the cartoon movement to take a curved development path.</p>
<p>Although this exhibition of modern Chinese cartoons does not have many works, it can give a further understanding of the prototype of today's Chinese cartoon movement to people who do not understand it, so that they can understand the task of the cartoon movement, give correct criticism, and cultivate it with sympathy, then the Chinese cartoon movement will develop smoothly step by step.</p>
<p>In order to enrich the ability to resist the war, we must improve the ranks of the intellectual war. In order to improve the ranks of the intellectual war, we must actively carry out the cartoon movement. This exhibition is just the beginning of the work. We hope that comrades from all walks of life can give us some correct guidance to strengthen the power of the intellectual war.</p>
