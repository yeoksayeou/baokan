<h3>日本對蘇進攻的作用</h3>
<p>蘇日關係，自從漁約問題上日本屈膝後，雙方相安已有相當時間，但是最近又以蒙「滿」衝突爲契機，日本似乎又在小題大作，除嗾使偽「滿」向蘇聯及蒙古提出嚴重抗議外，日本內閣還召開閣議，討論這個問題，特別向日皇報告。另一方面，發動輿論界擴大宣傳，對蘇聯極盡挑撥的能事。不過，我們對於日本這次再度的挑戰，却不能放過它在內政及外交上的作用。茲畧爲分析如下：</p>
<p>（一）響應德意兩　的國際行動。日本這次對蘇挑戰的主要作用，偏重於外交，其最主要的意義就是響應德意。德意軍事同盟在理論上講，日本是必然加入的，其所以未及加入的原因，是（甲）緩和英法蘇對德意日防備的加緊，（乙）緩和日本自己和英美法在遠東的衝突。然而國際情勢的發展，已使英蘇法的合作具體化爲不可阻止的動向。這幾天來英蘇法的合作已走上了新的階段，三國互助協定也已在簽訂的磋商中。德意見此情勢，頗有一點驚慌，日本就乘此機會，對蘇聯來一下進攻的手勢，討好德意兩國，使它們相信日本依然决心充當它們在遠東的警察。</p>
<p>（二）日本裝作進攻蘇聯，還具有離間英法與蘇聯的作用。侵略者常看透張伯倫猶豫不斷的弱點，以爲英國不敢貿然與蘇聯訂立互助同盟，更加開罪於德意乃至日本。這是完全利用着張伯倫對蘇聯不能絕對信任的心理。英國之所以與蘇聯締結同盟，當然是因爲蘇聯的軍力，特別是空軍力量的雄偉優越，在將來的大戰中，在東方足以牽制並破壞日本。所以日方最近拚命宣傳在僞「滿」邊境的空戰中，蘇聯飛機被日機擊落多少架，，多少架，牠要使英法對蘇聯的信任心減低。同時，還欲以蘇日糾紛之惡化移轉英法美等的視聽。另一方面，意大利也在宣傳英國召集四强會議，企圖啓發蘇聯對英法的疑竇，離間英蘇，日本對蘇的挑戰更非偶然。</p>
<p>（三）日本對蘇挑戰還有對內的另一種作用，就是鎭壓元老重臣派「親和萬邦」的主張，元老重臣派爲救日本的國際孤立而主張調和日本與各國的關係。然而他們所着重的還是日本與英美法的關係，所以對於少壯派軍人對英美法蠻幹，着實反對。少壯派軍人因爲侵華軍事的碰璧，需要局面的新開展，最近對第三國在華租界的進攻，及扣留輪船事件，卽其一例。但是對英美法的蠻幹，不但碰到了英美法强硬的抗議和實力的對抗，並且加深了元老重臣派的反對。於是，少壯派軍人轉變方向，向蘇聯挑戰，用意也是一樣：加强日本對第三國的强硬態度，而把元老重臣派的視綫移轉到蘇日關係上去。元老重臣派看淸蘇日的根本矛盾，反對少壯派軍人的蠻幹，而主張和英美法敷衍。）所以三十日定例的閣議完後，有田卽進宮覲見日皇。</p>
<p>現在，日本已發動輿論界，擴大宣傳蒙「滿」衝突情勢，「朝日新聞」竟認該事件爲外蒙淸黨的餘波，稱爲第二張鼓峯事件；「日日新聞」甚至於說「蘇聯玩火」，日本已不能容忍，必採斷然的行動。這種恐嚇的手勢，將玩到什麼程度，現在雖尙無法下具體判斷，但最重要的一點。却是英蘇法應有更深刻的認識，正如倫教一般人士的意見，「値此軸心國家多方阻撓之際，三國協定實以從速成立爲最得計」。</p>
<h3>抗戰與中國革命</h3>
<p>— 劉仰之</p>
<p>這次我們的抗日戰爭，無　是革命的戰爭。如果誤解了這種意義，或者不了解這秤意義，那末不論在理論上，實　上，都會老到和抗戰相反的方向，最後，便會消極的積極的來阻　抗戰。　前方的忠勇將士用血肉來抗抵日×的侵略，艱難困苦，忠勇奮發的情緒已充分地表現了；可是在後方，一般地還是醉生夢死，逍遙作樂的腐氣，到處充滿着。這是爲了什麼？便是由於思想的不正確，而陷於生活的寫化。又如最近汪精衛妄發宣言，搖尾乞　的向着日×求和，　又是爲了什麼？也是由於思想的錯誤，而陷於行動的反動。而這種生活的腐化，行動的反動，都由於思想錯誤，不瞭解這次抗戰的革命性，不　得抗戰是革命的戰爭。關於這點，蔣委員長在國民黨的臨全大會，巳很明白的指出了。他說：「此次中日戰爭，是國民革命過程中無法避免的一戰」（見中央週刊一卷十八期蔣中正：對日抗戰與本黨前途），這就是說，這次抗戰，是國民革命過程中的一個革命戰爭。而且他接着又說道：一殊不知此次中日戰爭，不是普通的國際戰爭，是中國民族爲完成國民革命求得自由平等的革命戰爭一（見同上），我們在這里；更可知道這次抗戰。是怎樣的革命戰爭了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>國民革命的目的，不外是內求統一，外求獨立，如十八世紀德意的民族革命，一方是反抗外國資本主義　侵略，一方面是內部的自我革新。就是德意兩國因有外來資本主義的侵略，引起了內部的改革；因有了內部的改革，才建立　近代的民族國家。歐洲各國的民族革命的目的是這樣，中國國民革命的目的也是如此，所以我們的國民革命，便是民挨革命，而我們民　革命的階段，一是內求統一，一是外求獨立。</p>
<p>中國民挨革命，自北伐以迄七七　溝橋事變，可說是貫的屬於第一階段的內求統一，現在抵抗日本帝國主義的侵略，便是第二階段的外求獨立，但內求統一的目的，在於外求獨立，因爲爭取民族的生存獨立，才完成了內部的統一。所以這兩階段我們不可機械的來劃分，一定要作有機的有法。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的蓄意　亡中國。在它的大陸侵略政　上已經决定了。所以二十數年來的中國革命，到處　著日×的阻撓。如民國十六年國民革命軍抵達南京時，它就藉口南京事件，煽動各國，想要瓜分中國。日×這一計劃失敗後，就改變方式，想要獨佔。而它獨佔的方法，最有利於它的莫過於用蠶食的計劃，逐步的侵佔我們的領土，分割我們的國家。所以在民國十七年國民革命到達濟南的時候，它實行出兵山東，用暴力來阻　，造成濟南慘案，而它造成濟南事件的目的，在於阻止革命軍勢力的北進，不給予中國的統一，迨至平津克復，東三省易幟，日×蠶食中國的政策，就受了莫大的打擊，而日×鑒於瓜分不遂，蠶食不成，反而變本加厲不顧一切的很急進的侵略中國、就造成了九一八事變。自從九一八以來，在這七年之中，日×的　略中國，眞是得寸進尺，無有止境，旣侵略我東北，又進擾我華北，日本想循蠶食的步騾，達到完全吞併中國的目的巳昭然若揭了，而我們的民族，一面是生命的愈趨於危急，一面是內部的統二漸吿一段落，所以七七　溝橋事件的發生，我們毅然决然的發動全民族的力量，很堅决而嚴重的抵抗日×的侵略。而我們的對日抗戰，以是抵抗日本帝國主義的戰爭，它的目的，在於爭取民族的生存。顯而易見的我們的抗戰是民埃革命，就是我們爲了打倒日本帝國主義的侵略，壓迫，來解放我們民族的革命運動。也就是說：這次的抗日戰爭，是中國民族革命的第二階段的外求獨立的戰爭，是國民革命的二期革命。所以，日×懼我們初期革命的成功，統一力量的雄大，而發動大規模的侵略，來消滅我們的力量，滅亡我們的國家，可是。我們因爲日×的積極侵略，反而縮短了我們初期革命的時間，增强了我們二期革命的力量換言之，這次民族革命的抗日戰爭，因爲它是初期國民革命的繼續，它旣具了初期革命的基礎，無凝地最後勝利屬於我們。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>我們的民族革命抗日戰爭，不論相自然的環境上，和人力物力上，都己具了勝利的優勢，但在這革命戰爭的進程中，我們革命的出路又是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>三民主義現爲中國革命的指標，這是誰也不能否定的。而革命的三民生義他所指示中國革命的路向，第一要使中國民族生存獨立，所謂民埃獨立，便是建設統一現代化的民族國家。所以三民主義的革命進程，一面是結束封建社會，一面是建立資本主義，但這里所謂資本主義，和歐美的資本主義不同，就是三民主義的資本主義、是國家資本主義，不是私人資本主義，中山先生巳很明顯的說着：「中國今日單是節制資本，仍恐不足以解决問題，必要加以製造國家資本方可解决之』：又說：「何謂製造國家實本呢？就是發展國家實業是也』，不過，國家實本主義的建立一，並不是三民主義革命的終極目　，而三民主主的進程，實乃含有三個實踐的階段，就是一面由　　國家資本主義，而否定封建社會，一面由實　世界大同卽社會主義的建立，而否定資本主義。</p>
<p>現在中國處於日本帝國主義積極侵略的境地，我　的革命，自然以民族的生存獨立唯一的目的，但抗日戰爭的經慰吿訴我們，欲求抗戰的勝利，非持久戰長期戰不可，欲求長期抗戰的戰略之實行，又非增加生產不可。我們要知道，發達生產現爲抗戰的基礎，和持久戰的條件，而這發達生產，便是中山先生所說的「發展國家實業』，便是「製造國家資本』，也就是實踐資本主義的進程。所以，實行三民主義，領導抗戰的國民黨。在這抗日戰爭時代，對于發達生產，要有計劃有步　的使它歸爲國營，但爲戰時財力物力的增加，在國營的原則下，仍可讓私人資本的活動：而這私人資本的活動，並非單純地發達私人資本，相反地是增進國家的財力物力，協進國家資本的生成，所以國民黨的　全大會宣言說，「此次抗戰爲國家族民存亡所　，國家民族之利益大於個人之利益，必當以國家民族之利益爲共同之目的』，這就確定了在革命戰爭的階段，民族卽家利益高於一切的原則，同時它又說；「抗戰期間關於經濟的建設，政府必當根據民生主義之信條，施行計劃經濟，凡事業之宜爲國家營者，由國家籌集資本，從事興辦，務使趨於生產的合理化，且必制節調度，樹之楷模。其官於私人企業者，由私人出費自辦，於國家的整個計劃之下，受政府的指導及獎　，以爲有利的發展」，本來中國的私人資本是很脆弱，再加這次日×的任意破壞，所謂私人資本更加　弱無力，而國家資本以四行的運用，和內外債的協進，必然地日漸增大。在大資本吸收小資本經濟法則上，中國革命的走向資本主義本甚至建立資本主義，决不會步上四歐資本主義的覆轍，再經過次大流血而達到社會主義的階段。總之，中國革命是要免除資本主義革命流血的痛苦的，就是一面以實　資本主義的過程來結東國內的封　勢力，坑拒日本帝國主義的侵略，一面以之爲手段，達到社會主義的目的，如果誤解這點，或則不理解中國的特殊性，或則在方法上啗於磯械論的錯誤，認爲中國革命後還會發生階級　爭，無產革命，領導抗戰的國民黨，在臨全大會宣言中已很明白的指出錯誤了，它說：「抗戰以前，中國經濟狀　尙無發生戰鬥爭之可能，抗戰期間，同仇敵愾，階級鬥爭更不容許其發生，抗戰勝利以後，基於民生主義之計劃經濟，巳使共有共治共享之理想　於實現，尤無發生階級鬥爭之必要一，這是已然的事實，也是將然的事實。三民主義的中國革命是依據了這個的歷史進程而前進的。</p>
<p>民族革命的抗日戰爭，是三民義的中國革命的必然進程，我們的堅持抗戰，便是堅持革命，我們的努力抗戰，便是努力革命，所以在這階段，主張妥協，生活　化，行動消極，都是民族的罪人，革命的反動。我們爲求抗戰必勝，建國必成，祗有以革命的精神。革命的手段，來掃除革命戰爭的一切障礙。</p>
<h3>對於中國青年統一戰綫的認識　（下）</h3>
<p>— 西安特約航訊</p>
<p>武漢靑年在抗戰以後有成百的小團體，每個團體都只有　十人至幾百人。爲了紀念一二九，比較　躍的武漢大學學生抗×後援會，武漢大學　讀同學會，華北流亡同學會，抗戰敎育研究會，聯合了業餘歌詠團，羣聲歌詠隊，健友社等小團體和各大中學校的同學，成立了一二九紀念籌備會，一二九　念大會開成功了，在華中靑年抗戰工作中佔了重要位　的靑年救國團，也就因此產生了。統一戰線工作不應該放鬆任何行動上統一的小小機會。共同舉行的提　會，茶話會，歡迎會，追悼會，都是促進組　統一的力量。組織統一也需要循序漸進。</p>
<p>統一的新生活促進會，統一的中山堂，中正室，民族革命室，對於更進一步的統一組織都是有帮助的</p>
<p>第五，統一戰線要能够順利成功，必需注意到上下層的互相配合，一切統一戰綫工作都要在政府或其他上層分子協助之上進行，卽使一時受到某些地方當局的誤解，也要用　久不懈的艱苦，力來求　誤解最後化爲諒解。另一方面，沒有下　的羣衆基礎更是不行，這　空頭的統一戰線工作無論表面上　　機漂亮一時，總很難做出什麼實際的抗戰工作，遲早總是要坍台的。</p>
<p>第六，爲了充實統一戰綫的下層　衆基礎，對於青年生活必須有適當的改善。只有盡可能解除廣大青年的痛苦，普遍提高青年的文化教育水平，認真保障靑年的各稱合法樺利，才能够鞏固　大　年統戰綫，才能够輩固擴天抗戰的實力。現在的山西，河南，安徽，浙江等省，靑年的生活都已經在改善中間，因此這幾省的靑年抗戰力量也比較雄厚。</p>
<p>第七，統一戰綫必需提高對於漢奸××的警覺性不加緊對於他們的鬥爭。因爲靑年的經騐不够，他們常常混到靑年的隊伍　來顚倒是非，製造磨擦，使統二戰綫工作受到很大的妨害，日本帝國主義現在的主要口號是所謂『反共滅黨」，所以漢奸××的主要活動也不外是反對國民黨，反對共產黨，反對國共合作。不過對於漢奸××不同種類　需要注意用不同的方法對付，有些是受了欺騙利用的，這些人還是可以爭取的：有些是大漢奸，是××頭子，他們已經失去做中國人的資格，已經絕對不可救藥，這些人就需要受嚴厲的　辦。</p>
<p>第八，對於有些專們破壞靑年團結的壞人，我們爲了靑年利益和抗日利益也不能不注意防備和對付。那些少數最壞的喪盡天良的壞人，天理國法人情都不能寬容他們，我們也不能　容他們。你要是寬容了他們，甚至幫助了他們，他們却一點也不會實容你，他們是要利用你的寬容和幫助反轉來殘害你。你要是不能掃除　　，障礙就要來　除你，併吞你消滅你。、統一戰　不是完全沒有鬥爭的，正相反，它是從進行各種必要的鬥爭中間發展起來。進行了這種必要的鬥爭，第一可以使羣衆了解我們眞正光明正大，仁至義盡，了解那些　人實在是惟恐犬下不亂的窮兇極惡的惡棍，實在是不能不羣起而攻之。第二也可以使這些壞人，或者得了公道究竟自在人心，懂得了人世究竟不容他們橫行，靑年統一戰綫究竟是不可輕侮不可干犯的力量，因而囘心轉意。第三即使他們還是執迷不悟，甘與大多數人爲×，他們不得不因爲衆叛親離，自　於失敗之路。　第九，對於我們靑年自已中間的各種錯誤的傾向，我們更要努力克服。</p>
<p>一種錯誤的傾向是關門主義宗派主義的傾向。他們、表現是：不願意具體的分析當時當地的客觀情况：不願意和自己團體以外的廣大靑年或旁的靑年團體耐心的和虛心的合作；只愛自己的團體，看不起旁的團體：只顧及局部的利益而忽視全體的利益：只迷戀於一些漂亮而空洞的名詞，口號和條文，自高自大自滿自足，不和羣衆打成一片，不努力適應環境，不向工作中去檢討和學習，沒有　大的容納異己的氣魄，沒有民主的工作精神，等等。</p>
<p>因爲關門主義，宗派主義，有些靑年在農村裏不尊重農民的生活習慣，在城市裏却穿了草鞋表示自己的前進。</p>
<p>因爲關門主義，宗派主義，有些靑位年捐一了家縣長的錢辦報紙。第一天就在這個報紙上　捐錢的縣長　了一通。（笑</p>
<p>因爲關門主義，宗派主義，有些　年在山西工作一定不成立民族革命室而要成立救亡室；到了非成立民　革命室不可的時候，外面寫着民族革命　的字樣，裏面却　是爲着救亡室。（笑）因爲關門主義，宗派主義，有些靑年羣衆團體規定着參加的手　必經多少人介紹，塡多少次表，宣誓遵守多少條苛刻的　律，並且必經各級領導機關審查通過，一直到最高　導機關的批准爲止。</p>
<p>因爲關門主義，宗派主義，有些陝西的靑年甚至公然指保衛陝西的口號是漢奸口號，因爲政府已經在保衛陝西，靑年再提出這個口號來就是懷疑政府，就是「漢　』，甚至還要挨打呢。</p>
<p>但是另外現有一個傾向也是極危險的，那就是投降主義的傾向，無原則的讓步就是投降。假如我　不堅持統一戰綫的正確原則，不堅持民族民權民生不可分離的正確原則，那就是可恥的投降。假如我們不堅持先進者的　範作用和批評態度，不堅持我們的高尙理想和高尙人格，那就是可恥的投降，假如我們害怕去和阻礙我們工作的力量進行必要的鬥爭　　見困難和危險就動搖起來，看見功名利祿和異性的誘　就動搖起來，那就是可恥的投降。我們要和反對關門主義宗派主義一樣的，堅決的反對　種投降的傾向。</p>
<p>我們應該在廣大的就年中間，澈底的展開反對關門主義宗派主義和投降主義的鬥爭。我們應該在廣大的靑年中間，進行有糸統的統一戰綫的敎育，進行各種正確的政治理論的教育，我們應該用一切方法，來養成，我們靑年司志的偉大　氣魄和氣節，我們靑年應該能　尊重旁人，同時也應該能够尊重自己，我　一面要有和衷共濟的精神，一面也要有『匹夫不可奪志」「士可殺不可辱」的精神，只有這樣，統一戰綫的前途才能真正鞏固，也只有這樣，我們的國民　的前途才有希望。</p>

<h3>蔣鼎交談西北軍事</h3>
<p>— 本報特派戰地記者賡雅</p>
<p>我們知道：西北抗戰優勢與　勢的分　點，在乎山西數十萬國軍實力能否長久保持？能否由一保持一進達反攻階段？能則佔優勢，否則處劣勢、這是一定不移之理、因爲山西在華北抗戰期中所處地位之重要、從正太路東出娘子關、可以進攻石家莊、而沿平漢路北上北平，南下　漢、從同蒲路北出　門關、可以收復大同，再沿平綏路東西推進、卽可攻　察綏而威脅僞滿、至其屏蔽陝甘甯靑，捍衛川澳各地，其意義之重要、亦幷不稍减于前者、綜觀十四五個月來的山西戰果（從去年三月十七日×陷風陵渡算起）。×方　次大吹大擂的所謂一肅淸戰」、「渡河戰」，「進攻西安蘭州」，「截斷中蘇國際交通」等等美夢，都被我英勇將士接二連三地將牠全數粉碎了。不、最近捷音頻傳、他　（英勇將士）　進一步收復？　多城鎭、如此，形勝勢優的山西和在山西披堅執說的一般軍民，可謂已發揮了他們最大的優點和能力了。</p>
<p>可是、我們若希望山西　不斷地增加新生力量，以完成今後她更偉大的任務：掃蕩境內敵氛，收復冀察失地。那末、便要西北各省，尤其是僅有一線河流之隔的陝西，爲之支持，爲之策應，使一切兵員物資均有源源補給之地、然後才能順利地完成其偉大任務。所以，史地學家顧祖禹說：「陝西之爲陝西，固天下安危所係。』現在還可以更說得切實一點：「陝西之爲陝西，固西北戰局勝敗所係，」</p>
<p>陝西的地位、旣如此重要、目前她的一切準備，能祖當得起這宗重大的使命麼？我想這更是大家所密切注　的問題、爲了這、便去訪問第×戰區司令長宮兼陝西省主席蔣鼎文氏——戰前我們原是在閩南漳州見過面的，一次生二次熟，這次　談眞爽利，他「開門見山」的第一句，就把問題核心抓住而作有力解答了。他說：</p>
<p>〔現階段的西北軍備之目的，不僅僅在乎鞏固西北，幷在於　備反攻華北　反攻華北，亦卽所以　固西北　這是有相輔相成的作用的。當然我們要努力在事　上作充分的表現！』</p>
<p>〔保衛西北，反攻華北，要在事實上作充分的表現。』這話『的當自在」地出自西北獨當一方的蔣長官之口，眞足以振奮我們抗戰情緒，鞭錘×人侵略　心。</p>
<p>『陝西已劃成戰區，一切政治設施，均向配合抗戰需要的光明之路大　步走去』。蔣氏　着冷靜的談鋒，似巳離開「司令長官一的皐比之座，而安閒地坐在「陝省主席」的位子上來說話了：『經濟資源方面，亦能支持長期抗戰之　用。民生日用必需品，如糧食，然料，均能自足自給。　則可由川寧各省，輸入補助。布匹棉花，產量特多，除本省消費之外，尙可大　輸出四川。戰後難民從隴海路源源來陝，抗×後援會　手救濟，並不感到若何困難，也就是因爲日用品就地籌辦得綽有餘裕的關係。特別是去年棉麥　收，　近十年來所未有；入冬黃河不凍，使我河防加固；今春雨雪調勻，又兆豐收之象。連年天時如此順利，當然有助益於我國防力量之增强。</p>
<p>「西北幅員廣大，戰線綿百數千里，關於交通　，雖然汽車汽油，有時感覺缺乏，但西北有的是馬車牛車，以及千百成　駱駝隊，把牠們善爲組織運用，故對軍運仍可應付裕如。」記者從地平面上常遇見這樣大隊車馬的軍事運　，曾聯想到：假若我們能在西北上空作最高島瞰，定可以從西（京）蘭（州），西（京）榆（林）、綏寧、川陝、甘新等各大公路　線上，同時發現　蟻搬家似的絡繹不絕的車馬運輸隊僕僕風塵的動態，有時還有些甲蟲般的汽車，疾馳穿插其間，同爲國難奔走的勞績，幷無二致，這是多麼偉大的一幅戰時軍運的美　！不過，要是這　呈映在「國家事管他娘」者流，以及漢奸　國賊輩的眼中，它恰好又是一幅冷酷諷刺的漫畫，因爲它能使他們深深感到一自愧弗如一啊！</p>
<p>一關于兵　問題，陝省巳徵兵至××萬名，但人民始終踴躍應徵，毫無怨言。』蔣氏怡然自得地繼續着說：」例如南鄭（漢中）徵兵模範實驗區、抽　抽不着的壯丁。竟有另行聯名具文，呈請縣府、准其提早入伍，得遂殺×之　。又如西安、潼關、榆林、南鄭等城　，雖屢被×機投彈肆虐，致若干平民生命房產，蒙受慘重損失，但一般抗戰情緒，愈轟炸而愈振舊，必勝信心，亦愈戰而愈堅强。</p>
<p>原來三　A民，自古勇于公戰的傳統精神，在今日而發揚光大，用以打擊×人西犯企圖，這幷不是什么超越事理的奢望，而是歷史和現實結婚的一　自然　物。</p>
<p>「再以關中地理環境來說：黃河天塹，事實巳擺在眼前，×人實難挿翅飛過。若逮師　羽劉邦入關故技，卽先奪我豫西要地，嗣北上洛陽，或西入荊　關，然後會師關中。可是採用洛陽一路，則有嵩山之阻，西入荊紫關，更有　嶺之險，其宜守而不宜攻，更甚於黃河之天塹，假使×人果有龐大兵力，向黃河或其他任何一路，集中攻擊三數月，並不　付以重大代價，倖得突破一同而入，可是山西有我數十萬大軍在後面用力踏住牠的尾巴，隨時威脅幷截斷他的聯繫，結果非把牠那批遠道深入的孤軍，全數解决不可。</p>
<p>『×人　然也深感山西我軍威脅力量之偉大，他　哭喪着險高喊出什麼『　淸」「掃蕩二類的口號。但我們已早將大批生力軍增防　境，幷向各路殘×出擊，而將牠們各別的迫處於被動地位。所以西北軍　約目的，在保　西北，反攻華北的策略，不僅建立在主觀上的必然性，而且具有　　上的成功條件呢」。</p>
<p>末了，我們從北戰場最近雪片似的捷報看來，　明蔣氏所說「保衛西北</p>
<p>「反攻華北」的偉論，已經在那　逐漸演成令人欣幸的事實了</p>

<p>【路透社倫教一日電】路透社外交訪員頃探悉、倫敦現己接得洛托夫演詞之全文、英官方對此演詞之印象係英、蘇二方意見之不同、乃屬形式上、而非實質上者、此種形式上問題之重要性如何、在蘇政府接獲英方之實際答覆前，殊不能有何聲述、至於關於與國聯有關之部分、相信如是熱烈擁護國聯原則之國家、當不致發生任何嚴重之不同意見也、對于波羅的海諸國及保證問題、英國認爲每一國家均有維護其領土完整及獨立之權、一切侵略行爲、均爲英國所憤恨者也</p>
<p>【路透社綸敦一日電】此問晨報對於莫洛托夫之演詞、紛紛發表意見、大致認爲該演　對於最後圓滿　結英、　、蘇三國反侵略確定、並未有何阻礙、泰阱士報與每日電聞報密　注意貝洛托夫　　之點、卽（一）英法建議與國聯盟約之聯繫、（二）波羅的海諸國之地位、泰晤士報稱、「英、法政府雖祈求國聯盟約之精神、但此　然非表示行將成立之協定、應　　成國聯行政院各會員國之何商討形所阻碍損毀也」、每日新聞報　爲、波羅的海諸國之地位、係最困難之懸案、但此種困雞，雖屬嚴重、亦非不可克服者也、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦一日電】此問泰晤士報外交訪員今日宣稱、倫敦對於莫洛托夫演講之象、係英蘇意見之不同、僅屬形式上、而非屬實質上者、此開以爲、莫斯科有一見解、卽倫敦方面過分自信　後之建議必能適合一切要求、莫洛托夫表示、於最後簽訂協定之前、蘇聯之每點意見、必須被　細攷慮、此間印象、認爲莫洛托夫演詞中、並未言及締結協定爲不可能者也</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦一日電】每日　報今日稱，蘇外長莫洛托夫之演詞、「實令人失望、因一　人士之意見、認爲　若干細節、尙須加以調整外、英、法、蘇三國協定已實際完成也」，每日電聞報稱、「自莫洛托夫之演詞觀之，若干困難與誤解尚未完全消除、蘇外長因仍未能施行互應原則、而表示不滿、渠之陳述是以表示英、蘇間尙有若干缺隙、必須加以彌補、而後始能訂立最後協定也」云，</p>

<p>【路透社巴黎一日電】自蘇外長莫洛托夫發演說後、此間大多數報紙對於英、法、蘇淡判三國協定事、均、表示樂觀、巴黎晨報稱、「法官方雖宣布英、法蘇三國對於有關之各種義務、已完全同意，唯關於、擬協定之形式、項料仍將有若干反對一小巴黎人報對於莫洛托夫過份加軍並不屬基本重要之各國不同點、表示不滿、卽　布衣夫人在「工作報上　文對於貝洛托夫之演說、加以歡迎、並　　三國協定或可於下週內簽署完成、又新聞報稱「英、蘇談判之困難點、乃波羅的海問題，雙方雖尚需要　大　和解退讓精神唯一切問題、均可安排商討、以求解决也」</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫的報告</h3>
<p>蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫於五月卅一日晚，在蘇聯議會報吿蘇聯外交政策，首先爲日僞軍向外蒙挑釁事件大聲警吿日×當局；繼又明白宣示蘇聯積極實行援華，這兩點特別値得我們注意，不僅揭破了日僞軍向外蒙挑釁的煙幕，不僅增加了我們對於堅持團結抗戰的無限勝利信心與鬥爭勇氣，而且更明自宣示蘇聯維護和平與援助爲國家獨立而奮鬥的被侵略國的政策，是同時同樣適合於歐洲和遠東的，對於日×等等近來惡意義誣蘇聯及離間中蘇英美各民主和平國家之合作的陰謀，又可算是一種重大的打擊擊</p>
<p>莫洛托夫同時鄭重聲明對於英法蘇互助協定談判的態度，於承認英法對於反侵略政策已有進步之後，卽明白指出其不隙漏之點，而嚴正聲明『蘇聯决不能替人蹈火取栗』，莫氏這一報吿，給一般關於反侵略陣綫的空洞的浮囂的樂觀論者，以相當重大的警惕，同時亦給一般關於英法蘇合作運動的惡意的失敗論者以打擊，我們希望英法等關認淸目前法西斯侵略者績極進攻的嚴重形勢，認淸一切投機取巧以至僞善徼倖的政策徒然增加目前的危機，趕快採取與蘇聯同舟其濟互信互助的步騾，以制裁×人！</p>

<h3>「喪」在香港</h3>
<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>喪在香港也有舊式，新式，宗敎式分，舊式亦有貧　之別。貧窮一口　棺，四個忤工抬了，兩個人分任吹笛和打　鼓，所謂「單笛」的，看來很塞酸。</p>
<p>富人却大　大擂，儀仗延長成　，汽車數百架跟着尾後，弔客們遊着送喪的「車河」，看來很熱閙</p>
<p>拿中上人家來說：儀仗多是幾架吊亭，翠亭，生花亭，兩三道路祭，一班「如點樂」——加點樂是大樂，每班要十多塊錢，——或更來班洋樂而已，一頂馬「飄色」，幾　洋樂，僧，道，尼，成班送殯；「開路神」一成丈多高，浩浩蕩，出會景般，成個鐘頭也過不完的，事實上己不多　。</p>
<p>出殯的樂隊是最混雜的，洋樂之後有國樂，還有「馬步吹」，頭鑼，京鑼，八音鑼鼓櫃，鬧個不停，打得鎭天價響。</p>
<p>洋樂隊每工要一塊二洋，普通一班要廿餘卅洋，他們幷不是高明的音樂家，拍子不齊固然常有，而在喪禮中居然奏出「風流寡婦」一纇曲調也常有的事，你說笑話不笑話呢！</p>
<p>當然，很高明的樂隊也有，軍樂隊也可以請來演奏，不過費用很驚人，每班非三百元以上不辦，還要指定時間，招待酒水。</p>
<p>最近自廣州淪陷後，『長敎館國樂隊』流到來香港，大概實新　奇，出喪也不能例外啊！這種樂隊很流行，很多人顧用，他們每工要一塊二，一隊廿多人，需費廿四元左右。</p>
<p>新式喪儀，多用洋樂一隊，喪車一架載了棺材，一路到墳場埋葬便了，很省事，很莊嚴。</p>
<p>這種　儀車大小不一，價錢各異，小的要廿塊錢，大的三十塊錢。</p>
<p>宗敎式和新式差不多，不過宗敎式多用馬拉的殯儀車，孝子們不披麻戴白；葬在宗敎墳場，不用和尙，却請教師祈禱罷了。</p>
<p>喪在香港，與別不同的是喪棚，生人住在香港不少住在四五層樓裏的，死了便要　搭　師父到來搭一個三四層樓高的棚，這　棚有着一道斜窄用竹和木板搭成的　，用來運棺木，原因是棺木忌經過門檻；住樓下的不　喜棺木經過他們的門前樓梯；同時斜窄，昏黯，「九曲十三彎」的香港　的樓梯，事實上也不能把化木抬上抬落，這種喪棚，每樓十元，卽二樓十元，三樓二十元，有數照計。</p>
<p>第二點是迷信，人死了，當夕要請尼姑和尙或喃無佬來念『倒頭經』，這種念經要十多塊錢。以後每隔七天，都得請尼姑和尙或喃無佬到來打齋念經的；普通多做頭，三，五，末幾個「七」富有的却逢「七必打齋，所謂「七七不倒幡」，便是每個「七」也樹起「招鬼幡桿」和「打齋鶴」，念經，做「功德」的說法。</p>
<p>打　誰也知道是「花錢功德」，和尙，尼姑，喃無佬，每班要三五十塊錢，紙扎冥鏹更難計算，因爲成間大晟，成隻汽船，甚至一九三九年最新型的汽車，馬，飛機，扎作店也能扎出來，打一次齊花三二百塊錢紙扎也常有的事。燒紙扎例，要租一間小鐵屋來燒，這種鐵屋也要十塊錢租。</p>
<p>因爲迷信，很多「吃十方飯」的人。像棺材鋪，菴堂，禪院，道館等都撈一大筆錢，別的且不說，就拿「安靈」來說吧！因爲香港的住，一層樓有幾伙人家，倘若不幸其中一伙有喪，二房東和其他同樓住客都不歡喜喪家在樓內安設神位，「做七」祭拜的。在這樣情形下，人們惟有把神位（卽靈牌）寄設在棺材鋪，菴堂，禪院，或道館襄。每個靈牌最少要繳費二十元，菴堂禪院，擺得堂皇一些，非三五十元不辦，棺村舖裏，五尺長的桌子可以安放五六個靈牌，鋪內隨便可以安放七八張桌子，那末八百多塊不用本錢便可以拿得，豈不是最好沒有的生意嗎？在人口增多，死亡率日高的都市裏，是他們的機會。</p>
<p>兩點之外要到虛僞，古禮制所無的繁文縟節。——</p>
<p>像顧用「承接担幡買水的」「營業孝子」；顧用專門替人器喪的「喊口婆」；……都是盧僞的。</p>

<h3>大上海十年紀畧</h3>
<p>— 宣南</p>
<p>上海成立於民國十六年七月七日，初名上海特別市　　隷於國民政府，經仟黃郛爲本市第一任市長，黃市長就職後卽　據國民政府所頒布之上海特別市暫行條例，委任秘書及各局局長，分別接任各機關，先後成立秘書處　財政，工務，公安，衛生，公用，敎育，士地，農工商，公益等九局以管理市政，並擬訂各項規章，公布施行，以　遵守；又擬定本市區域範圍，呈請國民政府轉飭江蘇省政府派員會同查勘，以明管轄而淸權限。黃市長就仟甫及二月，以舊疾復發而請吿退，國民政府乃任命張定璠繼任市長，於九月十六日　事，張市長爲樽節行政經費計，於九月底將公益局裁撤，所有該局主辦事務，按其性質，分別移交其他各局辦理，嗣卽着手分劃省市權限，確定市行政區域範圍，接收上寶兩縣各市鄉，一律改稱爲區域。</p>
<p>民國十七年七月三日，國民政府公布特別市組織法，市政府方面卽於八月一日起，遵照實行改組，除將農工商局改稱爲社會局，其餘各處局均仍照舊外，並於十二月二十五日成立港務局，辦理本市河港，岸線，碼頭，船舶等事宜。</p>
<p>民國十八年三月，張市長亦因病辭職，繼任者爲張羣。張市長於四月一日就職後，注意於整理改造舊市區固有的建設，並劃定市中心區域努力促進孫總理太上　計劃之實現。翌年五月二十日，國民政府公布市組織法，改定各特別市名稱爲市，直隷於行政院，市政府方面卽於同年七月一日起，遵照改稱爲上海市，並實行改組。除港務局奉令緩設，于同年十二月裁撤外，略略改變各處局之內部組織，而名稱一仍其舊，民國廿五年七月七日，市中心區市政府新廈舉行奠基典禮，興工建築，原定于次年完竣。嗣因時局變遷，張市長於次年一月，因病辭職而去。</p>
<p>民國廿一年一月七日，吳鐵城奉命繼任市長。吳市長就職未久，卽遇一二八之中日戰事發生，遷延三月有餘，市區精華，摧毀甚巨，乃經救濟災區，撫輯流亡，殫精竭　，勉渡難關。同時，鑒於市區範圍之遼闊，治安爲難，於同年八月一日成立市保安處，對於復興善後工作，及完成市中心區域之建設，仍繼續邁進，以求實現大上海之計劃。翌年十月，市政府大廈落成，吳市長卽定於國慶日上午十時舉行落成典禮。十二月市政府卽遷入辦公。</p>
<p>民國二十三年元旦，市政府舉行開幕典禮，同時慶祝民國成立紀念，並舉行擴大紀念團及新年團拜禮。又爲促進市中心區繁榮計，對於近代都市所應有之各　設備，亦一一開始從事道行，除放　道路，開闢公園以供市民便利遊憩以外，其他如圖書館，博物館，運動場，體育館，游泳池，警院，衛生試騐所，小學員，無綫電播音台，虬江碼頭等等重要工程均次第興　。</p>
<p>民國廿四年，圖書領，博物館，體育場，醫院，衛生試騐所，小學杉等，均已先後完成。小學校卽于二月內開校，體育場卽在九月內，移交于第六屆全國運動大會籌備委員會，在十月十日至廿日，開第六屆全國運動大會，市中心區車水馬龍，盛極一時。大會閉幕後，由市政府接管，並核定組織規程後，卽實行開放，以爲市民運動競技之場所。自民國廿五年至上海淪陷前圖書館，博物館，醫院，衛生試騐所等均設備布置完竣先後開幕。體育場內又設立上海市市立體育專科學校。虬江碼頭第一期建築工程，亦吿完成而先行開業。其他建設事業，如建設龍華風景區，創設浦東水廠及上海電話局擴充市中區用戶線等均着着實現或晉行中，豈知上海市成立紀念之七月七日，竟爲倭×選定製造事變作爲對華侵略戰之一日，更豈知距　溝橋事變後一月餘，上海戰事亦卽吿爆發乎！當三月間，廣東省主席逝世，國民政府命吳市長繼任主席，上海市長一職仍卽由兪鴻鈞代理。戰事勃發後，兪氏奉命爲市長，指揮市民共起抗×。抗戰凡四閱月而上海竟吿淪陷。然上海市民民氣至今不衰，咸信最後勝稱定屬我國，而大上海亦終必將爲上海中華人士所光復，大上海之復興，仍必將爲中華人士親手所經營所完成者也。</p>

<h3>上海之地理沿革</h3>
<p>— 蔚然</p>
<p>上海一海濱漁村耳，古稱滬凟，滬者漁具也。其所以名爲上海者，明弘治上海縣志卷一沿革中稱，一地居海之上洋故也」。</p>
<p>上海在距今四千餘年前，乃爲楊州之城；春秋屬吳，後屬越；戰國屬楚，相傳爲楚春申君黃歇封邑，黃浦江據卽因黃歇所開鑿故名，故亦名春甲江，簡稱甲江。秦置婁縣，領於會稽郡，上海當係婁之南境，漢初屬荊國，後屬吳國，尋又屬江都國，武帝時復爲會稽郡，隸於揚州，後漢屬吳郡，隸揚州刺史　，建安中爲朱治奉邑。三國吳爲婁侯國；晉屬吳郡隸揚州部，宋齊因之。　天監間省婁縣改置信義縣，上海卽爲信義　南境之地。大同初，復柝信義地置崑山縣，仍屬吳郡，上海又爲阜山縣地，陳因之，隋省入常熱，尋復置昆山縣改屬蘇州，隸揚州行臺。唐天寶十年，析崑山，海鹽，嘉興三縣地置華亭縣，屬蘇州隸江甫東道，其東北，之華亭海，卽今上海境也。五季隸吳越國，初屬開元府，旋屬中吳軍節度使，尋又改屬秀州。宋仍五季之　，隸兩浙路，南宋慶元初屬嘉興府，上海仍爲華亭縣地，其後人烟浩繁，海舶　　，漸成大市，乃立市舶提舉司及榷貨場，名上海鎮。</p>
<p>元至元二十七年，因知府僕散翰文之請求，析華亭縣之長人鄉，高昌鄕，北亭鄉，新江鄕，海隅鄕置上海縣，屬松江府，隸江浙行省，轄境東至海，南至華亭縣境，西至平江路崑山州，北至平江路嘉定州，南北四十八里，東西一百里，領鄉五，領保二十有六。上海初置縣時之區域，大小如此。</p>
<p>明初上海縣屬松江府，直隸南京。嘉靖間，析縣西境之新江鄕，北亭鄕，海隅鄉置靑浦縣，未幾卽廢，萬曆間，復置，又析北亭新江二鄕之未盡者益之。淸初屬府如明代，隸江南右布政使司；康熙初，分隸江蘇布政使司。雍正時，析西南境長人鄕地設南匯縣，嘉慶間再割高昌鄕沿海之地十五圖隸川沙撫民廳。是時上海僅領長人鄉三保，高昌鄉九保，地域竟愈縮愈小，直至淸末，尙屬如此，而未有變更。</p>
<p>民國建肇，廢除道。府，州，廳，改爲江蘇省直轄。民國三年復設道官制，隸屬　海道，轄境仍淸季之舊。民國十五年。淞滬商埠督辦公署成立，所轄區域，除上海全　外，益以寶山　屬之吳淞，江灣，殷行，彭浦眞如，高僑等一市五鄕之地，一切行政事務，均受公署管理，不屬於省行政範圍。</p>
<p>民國十六年，國民革命軍奠定上海，確定爲上海特別市，直隸於中央政府。上海特別市區範園除淞滬商埠原有轄境外，更加以寶山縣屬之大場，楊行二鄉，松江，靑浦兩縣所屬七寶鄉之一部，松江縣屬莘莊鄕之一部及南匯縣屬周浦之一部，跨境五縣，　市　三十，佔地二千六百九十二方里，東西廣約七十里，南北袤約百餘里。市區界址雖經劃定，然民國十七年時所接收者，僅爲上海市屬之滬南，閘北等十一市鄕，及寶山縣屬之吳淞，高橋等六市鄉，並一律改稱爲區。民國十九年五月，國民政府公布織法、改各特別市爲市，直隷於行政院。同年七月，改稱上海市；轄境仍舊。</p>
<p>上海市之四界東界川沙縣南匯縣；南界南匯縣；西界嘉定縣，靑浦縣，松江縣；北界寳山縣，又濱揚江子。</p>
<p>上海在地球經緯度上之位置　則如下表：</p>
<p>據濬　局測定江海關旗杆之經緯度，則爲；</p>
<p>東經二二度二九分〇〇·〇二秒；</p>
<p>北緯三一度一四分二〇·三八秒。</p>
<p>上海爲中國唯一之大商港，其港道卽由黃浦江水道構成。據濬浦局所規定之港區，以江南制造局爲港道上端，東溝口爲港道下端，全長計五萬四千英尺，中有彎曲五處。兩岸距離，自一千零八十英尺至二千英尺不等。除周家嘴沙灘外，卽最小潮綫，亦有一千至二千英尺之寬度，惟深遠二十四英尺之水道，港寬平均僅七百五十英尺而已。港內收容船舶之能力，約在四十萬噸以上，卽二千噸至萬噸之輪船，同時可並舶至七十　左右焉。</p>
<p>自外洋或沿海各地而來之船隻，須先經揚子江口，然後經吳渺而入黃浦，口外東北海面並無　石，　海　三十海里外，有六十英尺之深水；東南海面，多島嶼沙洲，頗爲航行之障碍，故須循島嶼間所立燈塔浮標等指定水道而行。</p>
<p>以上海港爲中心，水上航路可分為三路：一，沿海航路，二，內河航線，三，遠洋航路。</p>
<p>沿海航路，通達我國沿海各埠，計分綫程二：一爲南洋航線，自上海南行經寗波台州，温州，福州，廈門，汕頭，香港，以廣州爲終點，或亦延展至法屬之海防及西貢；一爲北洋航綫，自上海北行，可至海州，青島，威海衛，烟台，天津，營口，大連，秦皇島等地。</p>
<p>內河航綫，亦稱內港航綫，主要者爲長江航綫，其次爲蘇州河航　與黃　江航綿。（一）長江航綫，由本港出吳淞上溯長江，經過長江流域各埠，直達重慶，而上海漢口間一段航道長五百九十二英里裏，最爲優美，冬季能容吃水八至十英尺之輪船，夏季能容吃水二十八至卅尺之輪隻。（二）蘇州河航綫，蘇州河東流匯於黃浦江；由該河向西北行駛，直達吳縣，計程約三百華里。並通江蘇脰地，如靑浦，崑山，常熟，滸墅關，望亭，蕩口，無錫等地。（三）黃浦江航綫，由黃浦江向南及西甫行駛，通江蘇南部及浙江腹地，到抗州約五百華　，到吳興約六百華里。</p>
<p>遠洋航程，通達世界各大商埠。計分中　航路，中美航路，南洋印度航路，澳洲航路，日本航路，西伯利亞航路等。我國之遠洋航路以大連，上海，廈門，香港四埠爲起點，上海適居海岸綿之中段。</p>
<p>沿海航線，南進一路，似極甚早；而北進一路，則可以元海　爲起始。至於遠洋航程，南洋一路於明永樂時鄭和出使西洋，（俗所謂三寶太監下西洋）卽已開通，有上海人陳常同去者也。</p>
<p>上海地位得有今日之重要，時勢變遷固爲一大原因，而其地狎上位置之優越，實亦爲其發展之基礎。上海縣續志界志云：上海市當八省之尾閭，沿海七省之中心，太平洋航線之焦點，」誠能說明上海在地理上之優越矣。</p>
<h3>談談多年前的上海車馬費</h3>
<p>黃包車：</p>
<p>五十文從外灘到跑馬廳</p>
<p>電車路：</p>
<p>第一條由外灘到卡德路</p>
<p>公共汽車：</p>
<p>不過是十一歲小弟弟</p>
<p>多少年代前的上海城，誰都認共爲「賤城」的，那時都市的一切都很便宜，車資也當然在其律，根本不能和現在百物昂貴的現象相比擬於萬一，現在每個家庭，都把這向來認爲無足輕重的車馬費　進預算表去，就是現在的一些公司也以「津貼車馬費」之名義來加新，可見這車馬費在二十世紀的現在所佔地位的重要。</p>
<p>另外一方面有許多爲了逐日車資的突飛猛晉，素性就搬到城市的中心區域去了；這簡直也是促進都市繁榮的一個副原因！</p>
<p>當然車資（指人力車）的貴賤是視時間和環境的，如値空閑，則比較稍賤，一般說來，依據幾個老上海說當時從現在的外白渡橋到跑馬鬆路，經過一條南京路，只須五個銅子！</p>
<p>不過當時的人力車是沒有橡皮胎的裝置的，而且馬路又滿舖着石塊；在這樣惡劣物質設備之下，速度常然談不到，同樣　現在只須十五分鐘的旅程，當時　要四十五分，但，出了五個銅子的代價，你所希冀的要　樣高價？</p>
<p>一九〇八年三月、第一條電車路線就在公共租界上發現了，那時的終點東在外灘，西在聶安寺路卡德路的轉角一車資是四枚、復因廢除小洋後便利一般人起見、改爲一分三厘、其實還是一　。車　除上海電力建設公司所用六十　中　用二十輛外，別的就沒有了，幾不及現在　十分之一。</p>
<p>以後公共租界的車錢延長了，從北火車站經過老靶子路，界路，吳淞路，閔行路，西華德路，而至外灘，再從那面經廣州路，浙江路，和北浙江路而囘到火車站，這段路程，在一九〇九年開始行駛，費時約一小時，車資　十二個　子，至於後來創辦的楊樹浦外灘綫，也附帶的把其來作終點，車資也同　的十二個銅子，若坐三等則又可便宜三仙銅子。在相對的比　下現在法租界一段二十分鐘的　程，就得一角一分，這就可看出自去年戰事發生後車資價格抬高得可驚了！</p>
<p>在一九〇八年間，法租界的電車也稍有活動了，終點束在南頭市場，而向西延長至善鐘路　飛路轉角。</p>
<p>而汽車開始行駛，卻又要早些，約在一九　五——一九〇六，那時的汽油也只買到四角一加倫，祇有現在五分之一的價略呢！汽車的出租在沒有幾年前卽發現了，那時一部五人車所費的錢，爲三元，七人車爲四元，這些出租車子最大用處就在飯後爸爸會了媽媽孩子到外面去吸新鮮空氣的時候；因爲汽油價廉，所以出租汽車者賺了不少錢，不過另一方面部份修理所費的錢，却比現在特別多！到一九一〇年，上海也發現了像外國一般的流動出租的汽車，這此車大多停在外灘，隨時應付人之需要。</p>
<p>到公共汽車的出現，那眞更近了，在一九二八年兩租界都開始行駛了，雖然以後在車式和路程上都變更了一些，這究屬少數。</p>
<p>在這時，汽油的價格已增至一元一加倫了，直至數年前，一個汽車商人將蘇聯汽油（油遍地汽油）充至市場，這　價　就跌到六角一加倫，不過這種情形很快的又變了，現在總要一元四角一加；倫這樣結果使公共汽車和電車的生意更興隆，同時舊貨的汽車更多出售！</p>
<p>一般說來上海的生活程度確有些不適合中國人的口味，不是嗎？一個　幾角錢的工人，爲了路遠就不得不乘車，而每日的車資所費倒不下幾角這樣叫他靠什麽去生活？所以在這城市裏太多的人，都心顫顫地擔心着這門生活。</p>
<p>不過你假如拿世界的大都市來和上海比較，上海還不失「賤城」的嘉名，但，畢竟環境是不同的！</p>
<h3>上海坍！　楊樹浦三年陷下一英寸　其他各處每年一英寸餘</h3>
<p>土木工程會於五月廿二日開會，名作家兼工程師華特生在席間致詞云、一九三四年二月至一九三七年六月之間、沿楊樹浦路一帶下陷五吋有奇、此爲全上海區之下陷最甚者、是項紀錄、係自怡和路與詎楊樹浦路　角之工務處、水準基標所獲得、據信該路北岸巨大倉庫之下陷、爲該區基標變更之原因、上海其他各區亦有相類之變更、今已廢除之外灘基標、紀錄在一九一九年四月與一九三三年十二月間、下陷幾六吋平均比　爲每年一、二六寸、同期內外灘公園外水準基準記錄之下陷、平均每年僅四分之一寸、上海房屋櫛比區各　之下陷，自每年三分之一寸有奇，以至幾達二寸各　之分類與分析、仍按照鄰近載　之大小，底土之性質（卽是否在舊時河浜上）與鄰近深井之可能的影響而定，在舊時河洪上其下陷扣非河浜上者迅百分之九十，土地下陷之速度，與鄰近載車影響之大小成正比，且爲週　四百尺以內的深井之吸收作用。</p>

<h3>童星新聞</h3>
<p>波兒已　夏威夷</p>
<p>喬蘭　波兒拍完五彩片「小公主」後已於上半　三抵夏威夷、同行者　有她的父母，那時　集碼頭希望一覩秀蘭眞面目的影迷、不下五千人，</p>
<p>孿生五姊妹習禮忙</p>

<p>密蓋羅　購　　母</p>
<p>密蓋　　自「仲夏夜之夢」片崛起後、續演不少名片、最近　忽動孝思　出資購房產一座、贈給他的母親、影城A士對於密蓋此舉、大爲欽佩、</p>

<h3>新片「唐人街之王」完成　黃柳霜發表愛國談話　東方女兒發見了「慈母」的愛　在好萊塢出售衣飾救濟難胞</h3>
<p>在「唐人街之王」的慶功宴上蒞　的嘉賓、除了該片的男女主角亞金泰密洛夫和黃柳霜、以及導演以下的工作人員之外、還有　個記者、談話的趣、顯然是集中在黃柳霜身上、因爲黃女士是這個宴會上、一的外國人、他的祖國是正在和另一國家戰鬥着、</p>
<p>對於一位記者所提出的「女士對於中國抗戰有何感想、」這個間題、黃柳霜滔滔不絕地發表了她的高論、</p>
<p>「在我底立場上這是不成爲「問題」的、因爲你所說的「中國」、就是我的祖國、一個人的身體或者是在另一個國家、但是她的心常常屬於她的詛國、我不願意誇說自己是一個愛國者、而且我還得水認、假使我那次沒有去過中國我對於祖國的感覺一定還是非常粘塗遲鈍、但是我那次去認識了故國大地與人民的可愛、於是這次對日抗戰、在我感覺上、就和發生在我自己家裏的一件事情一樣、我應該補說一句、我上次囘國，完全是爲了看著我的祖國眞容、在祖國的懷抱中，我發現了「慈母的愛」、就從那時候起、我確認了我自己是一個中國女性、而在這個時候以前、我只是一個生長在落杉磯的東方女兒而已、我對於中國的被侵與抗戰的感想，是和自己的家　痛遭蹂躝、而家人正在拿着棒棍與持火器的暴徒搏鬥的感想同的、我悲痛、我憤恨、但是同時也感覺驕傲、而我所最以爲榮的是、臂如好萊塢的朋友們。他們的寶　的同情完全傾向於我這方面——她們所發起的不穿絲襪運動、以及以數倍于原値的價格、購買我的衣飾、使得我能把這些錢寄囘去救濟難民、這些偉大的行動與恩惠、都是永遠値得讀美與　感的！（安瀾）</p>
<h3>米老鼠名稱的來源　原來是火車輪所發聲音　被狄斯耐採爲卡通題名</h3>
<p>米老鼠原名Mickey　Meuse、根據法國記者Medeloine　Leeve所作的「華德狄思耐傳」中所說、米老鼠的產生及命名、是非常偶然的、</p>
<p>當時華德狄思耐正像一般庸碌無名的卡通畫家一樣、在紐約書『阿麗斯漫遊奇境記』長篇連續漫書，但是他感覺到自己和別人到底有點不同的地方、於是他離開紐約、到好萊塢　運氣去、</p>
<p>米老鼠的產生、正是在從紐約到好萊塢中途的火車上、</p>
<p>華德狄思耐喜數養老鼠，他喜歡她們的驚怯性格、膽小的舉動、在他的辦公室裏、放了一籠老鼠、其中一隻已養熟了、狄斯耐常常放她出來、讓她在桌子上跑、她的尖細的耳朶，不安地動着、尾巴兩旁搖擺，一　紅色的小眼睛向狄斯注視著、在工作疲倦的時候、她便是思狄耐的安慰者、</p>
<p>這一次狄思耐也帶了他坐火車、但是狄思奈在火車上沈思着，觀衆已經看厭了阿體思和小白兎、拿什麼新的東西來貢獻給觀衆呢、</p>
<p>火車向好萊塢飛跑、一手拿着書　、一手拿着畫紙、躺在火車的睡椅上、苦苦的思索、……</p>
<p>在西部的平原上、火車滾呀　的前進、車輪發出的聲音是「米奇茅斯、米奇茅斯……」</p>
<p>狄思耐閉目苦思了許久、依然毫無結果於是他漸漸注意起車輪所發出的歌聲：「米奇茅斯，米奇茅斯……」</p>
<p>突然間他坐起身來、開了身旁的鼠籠、把這袋養熱了的小鼠放了出來，他立刻揮筆在紙上描畫、寥寥數筆、一位銀幕英雄便產生出來、狄思耐在旁邊上兩個字「Mickey　Mouse」、</p>
<p>到了中國、人們把他譯爲『米老鼠』、（陳小波）</p>

<p>培英克英皇</p>
<p>學界排球賽，昨日有初級兩場舉行、培英與英皇之戰、雙方開始接觸後、培英守衛進取均能一致、英皇則守衛　形渙散、第一局培英廿一比十九佔先，英皇　于先吿失利、領英超、包家福梁、梁仕德、余　德等竭力反攻、培英周更申、陳仿輿、黃華翰、黃繼堯、等乃合力防禦、但英皇攻勢方盛、扣球頻施、以廿一比十八還以顏色、此後培英振奮從事、乘機扣殺。英皇陣綫遂呈崩潰、培英以廿一比十四佔得第三局、英皇冀圖收復失地、黃茂、陳倫　、梁華等竭力反攻、但　英軍容鼎盛、矢弩齊發、英皇戰至十七時、培英已以廿一吿捷</p>
<p>華仁勝西南</p>

<h3>足球員的責任</h3>
<p>凡一足球隊正式出場作戰的、有十一個人、所負的責任各有不同、而重要則一、譬如有人說、責任以後銜較前鋒爲重、如此、則這一隊僅能防守、不能攻人、反之、前錄雖佳而後衛不靈、則祇能向人攻擊、而不能防守、人來攻我、共結果必然不能良好、一個實力平均的球隊、往往能够將畸形發展的球隊、打得落花流水、原因便在平均二字上面、實力平均，則十一個球員在作戰的時候、不獨少見錯誤、也能將各個的技藝充分表現出來！不過要想一個入的球藝、站在水平　上確也不是一囘容易的事情、非要經過長時間的練習和諒解、不能夠臻到這種地位的、現在僅就各個的技術和責任來說吧</p>
<p>（一）守門員——他可算全隊的魂靈、一個守門員技術高明、可以增加全隊不少的勇氣、充當守門員的人、須身材高大、動作敏捷、呆滯不得，慌張不得、性急不得、要安嫺、要鎭靜、要有急智、要　應變、要身手矯健，在任何的急劇情形之下要勢按行事、更不可拘於一格、當攻隊來射門的時候、在敵人未動脚之前，須先察視射球　向、趕緊預備、端立自己的位置和姿勢、以備接球、時常要注意到自己所立的地點，不要太近球門下的白線、須知有一種球使你不得不退後兩步接球的、你如果太近門下白線、則　兩步巳過白線、便是你能够將球接得、也要算對方勝球了、所以守門員經驗深足的、大都是站在球門之外二三尺或五六尺之遠、但在敵人起足射門的時候、便須退後一兩步、迫近門下的白線、以縮小其接球的範圍、守門員最好是在可能範圍內、將來球用手接住踢出去來得穩當，足踢掌擊、皆非善策但在某種狀下，不得不棄手而乞於拳足、那是例外，譬如敵中堅在中衛線上　送一隻高球送到鬥前落下，這時敵人的前鋒亦同時　到門下、你如果去接球、那麽必然被敵　連人帶球一同撞入網內、此時　有用　擊出了，還有一　低球、向門前　快的襲來、敵人亦在球後十餘嗎如飛趕來、此種球雖然已出他的兩足範圍、但你如果低頭去接、那可要糟糕了、須知在你俯身下去的一剎那、他已經趕到你的面前、因爲要射球入門、便不顧一切的舉足了、你的面部恰巧朝着地面、你想是多麽危險的一囘事啊、此種球祇有用迅脚速踢出了、守門員接球在手、遇而門到敵人阻攔、須用搶球躱內法避之、但不能帶球行走四步以外、否則便成了犯規、此點應當格外注意、在接球時、應順球勢而避去反彈的力量、則無到手復落之　、在已失一二球後、不要懊喪、不要氣餒、應當格外振起精神來應付、在本隊巳得一二球後、更不能够眼空意大過頂落球、如果太急一切勿伸手去接、以拍成角球、較爲穩當、</p>
<p>（二）後衛的職守，在敵人大舉進攻時較前衛爲重大，前衛可以漏脚、或是錯誤、後衛却絕對不能一失脚、那不　就是失掉一球、所以充當後衛人們、實負有生死攸關的絕大任命，練習後衛的人、身體與氣力俱要强，目力要準確、脚頭要堅硬、頭腦要淸楚、膽氣要雄壯、在十分危急的時候、須使出十分　靜來舉動更宜謹愼，左右兩人須有相當諒解和合作、在敵人的前鋒迫近罰球區域的時候、一方面去搶刦、一方面　全到守門員、切勿糾纏不淸、組碍他的目光、在前鋒帶球前進的時候，要一步一進，切勿苟且偷安，以爲球已被前鋒帶出了、我的責任、已經完畢，這可就是根本錯誤了！而敵人反攻球過開球線、中衛去搶刦，後衛也須立刻頂備踢球、宜高不宜低、宜快不宜慢、在任何的嚴重情形之下、不能有故意犯規的舉動、須知後衛犯規、大半皆是判處死刑的、（十二碼球）一經　罰、那不獨失掉一球、對於自己的舉動方面、也會惹起傍觀者的不滿、充任後衛的人們、不可有勝負心、不可無責任心、有勝負心犯規、必多無責任心、則失球容易、勝負與責任、劃然兩途、願充任後衛的人　，自己去體會吧、中堅爲一軍之主、進可以助前鋒攻、退可以帮後衛守、責任重大、非具有精神勇毅、體力健壯、頭腦淸之人、决不能當此大任、他要俱有頭頂、足踢、盤射、搶射全副的功夫、</p>

<h3>體操要訣二十則</h3>
<p>（十一）體操必按由小運動而至大運動之順　、所以必以舒緩之運動——四肢運動開始、要之運動——　　運動居中、快速運動——跳躍動殿後、使運動景逐步增加、達於最高、</p>
<p>（十二）近時之行體操者、以爲體操運動時、血運增速、呼吸急促、天然己有呼吸運動之存在、不必特設呼　運動、惟　者以爲體操完畢後，欲使身體易於恢復原狀、結以呼吸運動、亦不背體育原理，</p>
<p>（十三）體操之取材、必須按各人體格情形及練習體操之程度，由易及難、由淺及深、循序漸進、不可一味好高務遠、不自量力、　　倒置、難易誤用、致　少效能，</p>
<p>（十四）體操之所謂難易深淺、乃指多部體操之次序與次序間而言，非指一部體操之節與節間而言、因此一部體操各節間難易深淺之程度、須力求相等、不可時難時易、時深時淺、否則、不但使習者有　者過易、難者過難之感、且運動量突然增减、亦背體育原理、</p>
<p>（十五）體操材料。原無時時更換之必要、但一種動作練習過久、往往發生厭；而同是某部之運動、因動作之不同、應用肌肉、往往亦有不同、倘始終沿用之、於全身均齊發展之本旨、容有未合、是以一部體操、操練相當時　後、仍以有更換之機會爲是</p>
<p>（十六）練習體操、必須明瞭各節體操之功能、然後無指導者指導時、亦可自由取材、任意變化，倘耳食　從，人云亦云、知其然而不知其所以然、則選擇材料、必無確實之把握、以訛傳訛、彼此誤認、必難獲良好之效果、</p>
<p>（十七）練習體操、必須明瞭各種動作之深淺難易、然後取材方能適合用幾入深由易入難之原則、以及自己體格程度之需要、欲辨別動作之深淺難易、祇須視其運動部分徑之長短與弧之大小爲斷、凡運動部分之　愈長、其動作所經之弧愈大者，運動量必愈人、動作亦必愈深愈　、倘能按動作細辨之、不難了然、</p>
<p>（十八）一部體操所費之時間、至多不過數十分鐘，其動、之連動量任憑如何宏大、亦無有不能支持之理、是以每節間必加以休息之時間、共至休息之時間、反　操練之時間爲多，實爲不必要之舉動、而每節動作次數、不論體力之程度、運動景之大小，均以四八等固定之數目加以限制、亦爲無謂之處置、</p>

<h3>國家與經済事業</h3>
<p>— 張德昌</p>
<p>統制經濟，計劃計劃，從一方面來看，有一點相同，就是以政治的力量支配，管理經濟事業的發展。用政治力量干涉經濟事業，雖爲今日所盛唱，但追溯其演變經過，却有幾百年的歷史背景的，這種演變我們可分爲三個階段來說。</p>
<p>遠在十七世紀，歐洲各國如英法荷蘭瑞典等，在實商主義的思想支配下大家都有一個富國强兵的理想。爲達到　種目的各國行了各種政策，籍以求本國工業，商業，航業及農業的發展。其中法國政府是最熱心的，路易十四時代有種種的法令，獎勵新興工業，懲戒不遵守法令的工商業家。英國也是如此。不過他們的政策在大體上說，收効並不如其所期之宏。當然也有奏効的，如英國海上航業的發展，無疑的得力於航海條律之實行。但就全體以觀，我們可以說當時用政治干涉經濟事業是失敗的。失敗的原因最主要的是當時的政府組織不　全、其本身不能担當發展經濟的任務。所以法國路易十四時代的政府是最熱心於發展工商業的政府，但也是失敗的政府。一個政府本身組織不健全，雖有有仍之心，往往爲了發展工商業，結果摧殘了工商業。</p>
<p>重商主義時代的政治干涉經濟事業的先例，是我們在歷史上找得出的國家與經濟事業關係的例子，但是失敗的例子，和近代之統制經濟，計劃經濟，思朝沒有直接的影饗。</p>
<p>重商主義時代的政治干涉經濟事業是失敗了，所以引起一種反響。這種反應是說明國家不應當干涉經濟事業，這種說法不但有史實可證，且有其一套學理，力量很大，風行一世。但是到了十九世紀事實上給我們一個大反證。國家應當于涉，干涉的結果是有利於經濟事業的發展的。十九世紀的佐證，是吿訴我們國家對於經濟事業的發展應加以扶助，管理。不但在生產上應加以調制，而且國家管理的範圍應推廣到各方面去。國家以政治力量支配管理全部經濟事業的例子是十九節紀末以來的一個特色。在農業方面，歐洲在十九世紀後半有一大威迫，卽美國農產品的侵入。</p>
<h3>數十年來所未有　（續）　日圓慘跌創新紀錄　日銀行界似不予支持</h3>

<p>未流通所謂軍用票時、日軍在華中乃流通日元、以購買物品與其他往來、至去秋似己停止流通、但是時業己流通之日元紙幣、並未收囘、至此卽出現於華中市場、估計流通華中之日元、共在三千萬至五千莫元間、日方拒不以兌換貨幣或貨物收囘流通於華中跌之日元、結果使日元跌落益甚此種跌價、當然對日本國內之日元有不利之反響、但日本銀行諒不致有行動、而支持日元紙幣在滬之價値也、若加支持、僅能以　櫥收囘日元的可能性一涂出之、但此適爲日本所不欲爲者、日本對待流通上海之日元、與德政府對待流通於外國之馬克、有某數點相類、德國對其紙幣之流通於海外者、確實不、而將收囘可能性减至最小數、其結果、德國紙幣在海外之比率、僅及馬克票面價値之半，日本或將决步德國後　也、</p>

<h3>湘湖難寫</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>一　湘西重鎮……沅陵</p>
<p>在敵人束己進佔岳陽，北正威　洞庭湖的今日，湘西在國防的意義上，佔着一個　重要的位置。湘西地勢是那麽地險隘，人民底性格又那麽地强悍，這此都是我們抗戰的需要中底很好的條件；不過文化的低落，抗戰意識的不普遍，都是一個急待解决的嚴重問題了·</p>
<p>正是武漢秦守，畏沙疏散的時候，我從長沙沿着公路經益陽，常德，桃源，官莊，而至沅陵，並在沅陵一帶停留了兩個月之久·湘西在我腦海裏有了深刻的印象，而且便我發生無限的感慨</p>
<p>我到的時候，沅陵巳由荒凉落後的縣城變成突然繁榮的小都市，——政治，軍事，商業的重心，湘西的重鎭·</p>
<p>沅陵地形狹長，位在羣山底山麓，前面低頭俯瞰，就是一條碧　的沅江，主要的大街只有一條，東西長不過三四里；茅房木屋，像　瘤一　在山腰屹立·土地荒蕪，瘦瘠得很，農產品缺乏，通常　　子，紅薯，凉　最多，據說從前人口只有一萬多，但自從長沙疏散，省政府遷移到　兒少後，人口就增加到十萬以上了，日用品和糧食　能自給的沅陵，此時便呈現饑謹，混亂的現　；旅館和住宅給公務員與高等難民住得滿滿，商店與山頂的茅房，也給軍隊和各樣的隊伍，佔的佔，借的借；這猪腸子似的城市，給擠擁得就要爆　了。大街上，從天亮到天黑都充滿了人，大家肩擦着肩，鼻子碰看鼻子；如果某支軍隊入境，全城人馬上都感覺得到周圍空氣底密度又增加了。當局雖然用過很多方法努力維持平　的狀態，但因外地人不住的入境交通困難，貨物供不應求，且文化低落，好商又從中國貨居奇；以致物價一天一天地飛漲，人口沒法疏散，市面秩序依然混亂；人們不能安靜下來工作，這無論在個人或國家方面都是一種損失呵！</p>
<p>從益陽至常德聞，沒有什麽　山峻嶺，但過了官莊就盡是連綿不絕的大山了。公路　一條大爬蟲一樣，艱難困苦地爬過許多山坡，穿過許多荒蕪而嚴峻的崇嶺，過沅陵至十里舖左右才開了岔，向西北過了　市，永緩而入四川境，西南向可經芷江，晃縣而進貴州。從前，常德，桃源都是繫盛富庶的地方，自洞庭湖受敵威脅，常德，桃源屢遭慘炸之後，繁榮便集中在沅陵了。沅陵以西，如乾城，永綏，更是貧瘠　苦，一部份人民，因貧苦不能生話，淪爲盜匪的也不少。</p>
<p>說到地勢，自官莊以西，便是高峻的山嶺，公路兩旁的大山，簡直是天生的，屹立不動的衛士，不要說敵人發機械化部隊到這里施展不得，就算一個普通徒步的旅行家走過，也覺到荒漠得有點害怕。近看盡是高聳的巨石，遠望都是鬱綠的茂林，敵人的炮火到底朝那兒放發呢？茫茫數十里，才有幾家寥落的茅屋，坦克車隊有胆量儘往沙漢似的荒野前進喘？他們的增援和輸送，能有不被截斷的保證嗎？——不用說，這些都是我們决定了的優勝條件，如果咖上軍事上配備得宜，且廣泛地發動　　鬥爭，那麽，×人就算派五個師團朝湘西重鎮沅陵進攻也是白費的，結果只好全部斷送罷了。</p>
<p>湘西旣是貧瘠　常，所以人民大都生活得很質樸，不論冬夏，多穿藍布衫褲，生活較舒適的人便穿一套完好的衣服，如果是中下的人們，那麽他們所穿的補綴不堪，顏色淡褪的了·因爲湖南米產量　富，人們每天習慣吃三頓至四頓，每頓主要的菜是辣椒豆鼓，頂多不過加一點蔬菜和豆子吧了；但他們却鍛鍊出一付强健的體格，受得住太陽的蒸晒，和風雨的侵襲，登山越嶺，跟我們在平地走路一樣　快·因爲環境和生活的磨練，他們早就養成强悍的性格和胃險的精神了。——這種力量，如果能好好的運用並且發揮，誘導至抗戰範圍來，不是成爲一種偉大的力量嗎了</p>
<p>我相信，如果政府能够有計劃地發　湘西底各　優點，那麽，官莊，沅陵一帶，是一道鐵似地牢固的　防線，湘西的人民一定會成爲千百股最勇悍的游擊隊。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>航</h3>
<p>— 雪明</p>
<p>在江畔，金黃色的江水上，蕩漾着串串的帆影。薄暮的霧，在這亞熱帶，總像一層紗，罩蒙着田野，而飄浮於江上的　航，也慢緩地消失在潮濕的霧中。星星鑲在無際的高空，又似乎在窺看着我·當我拖着依戀的脚步歸來後，航影留給我喜愛透頂的情感。</p>
<p>實年，沉醉在神話幻想之中的童年，船航給了我無數虛的期望。挺秀的尖角形，慢慢滑翔於恬靜得像停滯了的金黃色的韓江流上，漸漸地漸漸地又消失於轉纖的山影裏。終年往來的船航，以及在陽光中陰雨中，像江水一樣平靜愉快的船夫們的生活，和着米粮土產磁器一樣消失又復現於江中。</p>
<p>可是，自去年×騎　進了江南，×機翻騰於江畔，炸彈給江邊的泥土帶起了飛花，於是，韓江黃濁的江水上染了紅血·</p>
<p>接着，烽火也迫着我泣別了江畔古老的家園·</p>
<p>失去了一種興奮透頂的情感，輪船載着我浮在澎湃的海濤中，黑水托着弧天，海濤比江潮來得更兇險利害，波浪不時拍擊着船身，深藍色的海洋上，銀白色的浪花中，永再也看不見有慢緩滑着的船航，再也不敢囘頭再也不敢囘頭，因爲腦後就是一種碧　的家園與留給我喜愛的情感之船航啊。</p>
<p>海烏和雪白的浪花做了受難的人們旅途中的愛侶，廣闊的海天給了人們無限的囘憶，一般難言的情緒擁上心頭，於是發出了感慨；「任管×機翻翔家　上空，誰能忘了大時代的風暴，祖國正面對着風浪急進，我們也該鼓起勇氣乘風破浪。」</p>
<p>如今，同家鄉隔別了整年，也沒有見過　暮中飄浮於平靜的江水上慢慢滑翔着的歸航。韓江流域，或只有×機盤旋，平靜的江水，或只有鮮紅的血流。</p>
<p>捧着錄衣人送來的　音，透過了淚　的眼望着滿天的星斗，祖國正面對着風暴進行，我們也在暴風雨中受難，於是淚　漸　地化爲淚雨了。</p>
<h3>赤坎之行</h3>
<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>過了三十多里的泥濘長途而抵達白沙時，巳是黃昏時分了·這使我非常爲難起來：留宿　裏還是趕到赤坎去呢？要是留宿吧·到江會前綫去的一個最好的機會就會眼巴巴地錯過了：倘若不，我就沒有察暇去視察這裏大轟炸後的情形了：那麽，不是白走了半天的難苦路程　？</p>
<p>苦惱了很久，，一位道地的朋友終於帮助我解决了這難題了·他先導引我　吊過每處荒寂了的彈痕後，又替我叫來了一輛脚踏車。他這　向我慰藉着：</p>
<p>「林，搭了這單車，你今夜還可以在入夜時分趕到赤坎·』</p>
<p>看看袋我，長短針正在六宇左近的位置上接吻·我手忘脚亂地坐上了單　尾的木板上，匆促地道了一聲「再會」，單車就輕捷地穿通馬路定向郊外去了·</p>
<p>那踏單車的是一位肥健的靑年，從說話時幾　特別的字音，我分出了他是一個本地人。他姓黃，從前是一位蘇杭店的夥伴，現在就轟他的兩條腿替人踏單車生活</p>
<p>在莽蒼蒼的暮色中，單車　過了平坦的公路，輪子　着　砂，不斷地發出有節奏的低衛的吟唱，晚風和柔地從前面的原野拂來，我的兩　，不斷　攝影着每一節陌生而秀美的風景。那時，心境上的苦惱已換上了愉悅；連肚子空着也忘記了·</p>
<p>這車于一寸寸地滑過去的是「沙赤公路」·路是那麽平坦而又完整，爲什麼不行車呢？我不能鎮壓心上的懷疑，就以這問題詢問那位踏車的靑年。</p>
<p>他專心地望着前頭並不囘看或　視一下：他說：</p>
<p>『許多年來，這　的來往車輛沒有停斷過。自從公路實行破　以來，這裏雖因腹地而未破壞，但十多里外的赤坎段己被破壞，路程太短，行車公司虧了本，就不再通車了。後來因感到種種不便，又有人恢復了行車·那知三月三十日×機在白沙施行大屠殺的時候，兩輛汽車也被毀傷了，以後就再沒有汽車駛動了！』</p>
<p>「現在，這裏的人多數怎樣來往呢？』車子拐一個小　時，我這樣問。</p>
<p>「不　說是多數行路啦，趕路時坐單車，有錢人可以坐轎子。』他依舊緊握着車頭，兩眼望向遠方，彷彿並不在向我說·</p>
<p>「女人也有坐單車嗎？』</p>
<p>「有，最多坐的還是那些茶樓的女招待呢！」他說時，嘻開了牙　微笑着，這一笑宛如是藏着許多神秘似的。</p>
<p>我也想起了鄉下人種種閉塞情形，尤其是鄉村的婦女，從前偶兩地看到一個女人坐單車時，她們無不認爲奇跡·但現在，她們自已也來坐一位不相識的男子的車尾了，抗戰帶給鄉村的轉變也極不平凡呵！……</p>
<p>路經過一重重的山，車一段段地滑過沙路，走到一叢山邊時，那踏車的靑年對我說：</p>
<p>『這是白足山，那裏有文天祥的墓穴·』</p>
<p>我興起了一串懷占的心倩，覺得文天祥的那　堅貞的犧牲精神，在還抗戰時期是更應　揚光大起來的，　是爲什麽漢奸還是這麽多呢</p>
<p>忽然，車子在一堆高　的浮坭之前停止了。我付了六角十　　的車費，和那位肥健的靑年吿別時，他和靄地吿訴我：</p>
<p>『這裏是蝴蝶崗，此去離赤坎還有五里路。』</p>
<p>公路吸　得很澈底，在暮色迷茫中不好走也走不得，只得找一條小石徑走。</p>
<p>囘頭望望，那位送我來的肥　的靑年連同單車的影子巳消失了·再翻頭仰望天室，夜色又增深沉，也許今夜會下雨　？當我正這樣預測時，忽而想起了在白沙掉落了一把「時來」傘子，啊，怎麽仔？到　——倒霉——</p>
<p>我懊惱地遲疑了一會，終於又一鼓　兒向前進，穿過了深沉的暮色，一步步地接近向那吐露着隱約的燈光的處所。</p>
<p>『有汁麽要緊呢？總算今夜己趕到了赤坎，明天就可以趕到江會的前綫了·」我這樣安慰着自己。</p>
<p>一九三九九，五，草于赤坎</p>
<h3>下鄉前後</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>—壯丁生活的片叚</p>
<p>一片微弱的光，映上紙　，室內的佈置，就　約的現出了模　的輪　。掀開毛毯，揉一揉艨朧的　眼，我迅速地爬下床來·</p>
<p>推開了窻一望，殘夜的昏暗己消失於淸灰的晨曦中，李同志喜悅得急　地伸長子，打起湖北　官話：</p>
<p>「今天天氣一定好，下鄕的宣傳一定很順利的！快些準備」！</p>
<p>也不理　的騷動，忙常地背上軍用毯和包袱，一羣人紅　着　挺起胸脯走出臥室，跑進操場，</p>
<p>高空己換上了銀灰色的外衣，晨星也消褪了最後的光芒，天風帶着一陣凉意，　進我們單薄的制服：草莽上的夜露，潤濕着帆布跑　，號音和口哨　得　，像一把火，在各人底心田喜强烈地燃　着。</p>
<p>齊的行列，在敎練官壯　而嚴肅的聲調中，就分成四大宣傳隊，十六支隊，劃分了路綫和區域以後，他又把國民精神總動員的宣傳綱要重說一　，最後還勉　我們說：「發動到鄕村裏，就是要增加　村裏的抗戰力量·希望你們達到預期的目的；使每一個農夫或牧童，都能了解國民公約的功效，和他們本身的義務給予侵略者嚴重的打擊……·」</p>
<p>他的話結東在第二陣出發的號音開始的時候，</p>
<p>開動：走上狹窄的小路，灣進曲折的　巷，街上，路燈閃爍着餘光，睡意　　的店　，下落着舖門板·……穿過了城門洞，穿過了電網，我們投向郊　去。</p>
<p>公路上，太陽已爬上了地平　，血紅的柔和的新　的强先斜射過來，像一片金黃的輕紗，拖垂到大地的邊沿襯托於朝囁四週的斑斕彩雲，把半天點綴得瑰奇華　映照　　橫的阡陌·田　和菜　，淸晨的温　氣息，在　漫　·</p>

<h3>The Role of Japan's Attack on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Since Japan yielded in the fishery agreement issue, Soviet-Japanese relations had been relatively peaceful for quite some time. However, recently, using the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia conflict as an opportunity, Japan seems to be making a mountain out of a molehill again. In addition to instigating the puppet "Manchukuo" to issue serious protests to the Soviet Union and Mongolia, the Japanese cabinet also held a cabinet meeting to discuss this issue, and reported it specifically to the Emperor. On the other hand, it has launched propaganda campaigns in the media, doing its utmost to provoke the Soviet Union. However, we cannot overlook the internal and external functions of Japan's renewed challenge this time. Here is a brief analysis:</p>
<p>(1) Responding to the international actions of Germany and Italy. The main role of Japan's challenge to the Soviet Union this time is focused on diplomacy, and its most important significance is to respond to Germany and Italy. In theory, Japan is bound to join the German-Italian military alliance. The reasons why it has not yet joined are: (A) to ease the increased vigilance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union against Germany, Italy, and Japan; (B) to ease the conflict between Japan and Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East. However, the development of the international situation has made the cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France a concrete and unstoppable trend. In recent days, the cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France has entered a new stage, and a mutual assistance agreement between the three countries is already under negotiation for signing. Germany and Italy are somewhat alarmed by this situation, and Japan is taking this opportunity to make a gesture of attacking the Soviet Union to please the two countries and make them believe that Japan is still determined to act as their policeman in the Far East.</p>
<p>(2) Japan's pretense of attacking the Soviet Union also has the effect of alienating Britain and France from the Soviet Union. Aggressors often see through Chamberlain's hesitant weaknesses, believing that Britain would not dare to rashly conclude a mutual assistance alliance with the Soviet Union, further offending Germany, Italy, and even Japan. This completely exploits Chamberlain's psychological inability to absolutely trust the Soviet Union. The reason why Britain is concluding an alliance with the Soviet Union is, of course, because of the Soviet Union's military strength, especially the magnificent superiority of its air force, which will be sufficient to contain and destroy Japan in the East in a future war. Therefore, Japan has recently been desperately promoting in the puppet "Manchukuo" border's air battles how many Soviet aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft, how many aircraft, it wants to reduce Britain and France's trust in the Soviet Union. At the same time, it also wants to divert the attention of Britain, France, and the United States by exacerbating the Soviet-Japanese dispute. On the other hand, Italy is also promoting the idea of Britain convening a four-power conference, attempting to arouse Soviet suspicion of Britain and France, and alienate the Soviet Union and Japan. Japan's challenge to the Soviet Union is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>(3) Japan's challenge to the Soviet Union also has another internal function, which is to suppress the "harmony with all nations" proposition of the elder statesmen faction. The elder statesmen faction advocates reconciliation between Japan and other countries in order to save Japan's international isolation. However, what they emphasize is the relationship between Japan and Britain, the United States, and France, so they strongly oppose the reckless actions of young officers towards Britain, the United States, and France. Because of the setbacks in the military invasion of China, young officers need a new development of the situation. The recent attacks on third-country concessions in China and the detention of ships are examples of this. However, reckless actions against Britain, the United States, and France not only encountered strong protests and strong opposition from Britain, the United States, and France, but also deepened the opposition of the elder statesmen faction. Therefore, the young officers changed direction and challenged the Soviet Union, with the same intention: to strengthen Japan's tough stance towards third countries and shift the attention of the elder statesmen faction to Soviet-Japanese relations. The elder statesmen faction sees clearly the fundamental contradiction between the Soviet Union and Japan, opposes the reckless actions of the young officers, and advocates perfunctorily dealing with Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, after the regular cabinet meeting on the 30th, Arita immediately went to the Imperial Palace to meet the Emperor.</p>
<p>Now, Japan has launched a media campaign to expand propaganda about the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia conflict. The "Asahi Shimbun" even considers the incident to be the aftermath of the Outer Mongolian purge, calling it the Second Changkufeng Incident; the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" even says that "the Soviet Union is playing with fire" and that Japan cannot tolerate it and will take decisive action. To what extent this threatening gesture will be played out is still impossible to make a concrete judgment, but the most important point is that Britain, the Soviet Union, and France should have a deeper understanding, just as the opinion of the general public in London, "At this time when the Axis countries are obstructing in every possible way, the most effective way is to establish a three-nation agreement as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>The War of Resistance and the Chinese Revolution</h3>
<p>— Liu Yangzhi</p>
<p>Our War of Resistance against Japan this time is undoubtedly a revolutionary war. If we misunderstand this meaning, or do not understand this meaning, then, whether in theory or in practice, we will go in a direction contrary to the War of Resistance, and finally, we will passively or actively obstruct the War of Resistance. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front are resisting the invasion of Japanese bandits with their flesh and blood. Their difficult, arduous, loyal, and courageous emotions have been fully expressed; but in the rear, the general atmosphere is still one of drunken stupor, living for pleasure, and corruption everywhere. Why is this? This is because of incorrect thinking, which leads to the degeneration of life. Furthermore, what is the reason for Wang Jingwei's recent reckless declaration and his tail-wagging plea for peace with the Japanese bandits? It is also due to erroneous thinking, which leads to reactionary actions. And this kind of corruption of life and reactionary actions are all due to erroneous thinking, a failure to understand the revolutionary nature of this War of Resistance, a failure to realize that the War of Resistance is a revolutionary war. On this point, Chairman Chiang has already clearly pointed out at the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress. He said: "This Sino-Japanese War is an unavoidable battle in the process of the National Revolution" (see Chiang Kai-shek: The War of Resistance Against Japan and the Future of Our Party, Central Weekly, Vol. 1, No. 18). This means that this War of Resistance is a revolutionary war in the process of the National Revolution. Moreover, he went on to say: "One does not know that this Sino-Japanese War is not an ordinary international war, but a revolutionary war in which the Chinese nation seeks freedom and equality in order to complete the National Revolution" (see the same source). Here, we can further understand what kind of revolutionary war this War of Resistance is.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Revolution is none other than seeking internal unification and external independence, just like the national revolutions of Germany and Italy in the 18th century, which, on the one hand, resisted the invasion of foreign capitalism, and, on the other hand, were internal self-reforms. That is, the invasion of foreign capitalism in Germany and Italy caused internal reforms; because of internal reforms, modern national states were established. The purpose of the national revolutions in European countries was like this, and the purpose of the Chinese National Revolution is also the same. Therefore, our National Revolution is a national revolution, and the stages of our national revolution are, first, seeking internal unification, and second, seeking external independence.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Revolution, from the Northern Expedition to the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, can be said to have consistently belonged to the first stage of seeking internal unification. Now, resisting the invasion of Japanese imperialism is the second stage of seeking external independence. However, the purpose of seeking internal unification is to seek external independence, because only by fighting for the survival and independence of the nation can internal unification be completed. Therefore, we cannot mechanically divide these two stages; we must treat them in an organic and methodical manner.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism deliberately sought to destroy China. It has already been decided in its continental invasion policy. Therefore, the Chinese revolution of the past twenty-odd years has been hindered by Japanese bandits everywhere. For example, when the National Revolutionary Army reached Nanjing in 1927, it used the Nanjing Incident as an excuse to incite various countries, wanting to divide China. After this plan of the Japanese bandits failed, they changed their approach, wanting to monopolize it. And the method of monopolization that was most beneficial to it was none other than the plan of nibbling away, gradually invading our territory and dividing our country. Therefore, when the National Revolution reached Jinan in 1928, it implemented sending troops to Shandong, using violence to obstruct it, creating the Jinan Massacre. The purpose of its creation of the Jinan Incident was to prevent the northward advance of the revolutionary army's forces, not to give China unification. After the recovery of Peiping and Tianjin and the change of flags in the three northeastern provinces, the policy of the Japanese bandits nibbling away at China suffered a great blow. And, seeing that partitioning was not successful and nibbling away was not working, the Japanese bandits instead became even more reckless, recklessly and hastily invading China, thus creating the September 18th Incident. Since September 18th, in these seven years, the Japanese bandits' invasion of China has truly been getting an inch and wanting a mile, without end. Having invaded our Northeast, they then intruded into our North China. Japan's intention to follow the steps of nibbling away to achieve the complete annexation of China has become obvious, and our nation, on the one hand, is seeing its survival become increasingly precarious, and, on the other hand, internal unification is gradually coming to an end. Therefore, with the occurrence of the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, we resolutely and decisively mobilized the strength of the entire nation, resolutely and seriously resisting the invasion of the Japanese bandits. And our War of Resistance against Japan is a war to resist Japanese imperialism, and its purpose is to fight for the survival of the nation. It is obvious that our War of Resistance is a national revolution, that is, a revolutionary movement in which we liberate our nation by overthrowing the invasion and oppression of Japanese imperialism. In other words, this War of Resistance against Japan is the second stage of the Chinese national revolution, a war to seek external independence, and a second revolutionary period of the National Revolution. Therefore, the Japanese bandits fear the success of our initial revolution and the great strength of unification, so they launched a large-scale invasion to eliminate our strength and destroy our country. However, because of the Japanese bandits' active invasion, we have instead shortened the time of our initial revolution and strengthened the strength of our second revolutionary period. In other words, this national revolutionary War of Resistance against Japan, because it is a continuation of the initial National Revolution, already has the foundation of the initial revolution, and undoubtedly, final victory belongs to us.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Our national revolutionary War of Resistance against Japan, whether in terms of the natural environment or in terms of manpower and material resources, already possesses the advantage of victory. But in the course of this revolutionary war, what is our revolutionary way out?</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People are now the guide for the Chinese revolution, which no one can deny. And the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, what it indicates is the direction of the Chinese revolution: first, to enable the Chinese nation to survive and be independent. So-called national independence is to build a unified and modern national state. Therefore, the revolutionary process of the Three Principles of the People is, on the one hand, to end feudal society, and, on the other hand, to establish capitalism. But this so-called capitalism is different from the capitalism of Europe and the United States, that is, the capitalism of the Three Principles of the People is state capitalism, not private capitalism. Mr. Sun has already clearly said: "Today, merely regulating capital in China is still not enough to solve the problem; it is necessary to add the creation of state capital in order to solve it." He also said: "What is meant by creating state capital? It is to develop national industries." However, the establishment of state capitalism is not the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People revolution. The process of the Three Principles of the People actually contains three practical stages, that is, on the one hand, to negate feudal society through state capitalism, and, on the other hand, to negate capitalism by realizing the Great Harmony of the World, that is, the establishment of socialism.</p>
<p>Now that China is in a situation of active invasion by Japanese imperialism, our revolution naturally has national survival and independence as its sole purpose. But the experience of the War of Resistance against Japan tells us that, in order to achieve victory in the War of Resistance, a protracted war and a long-term war are indispensable. In order to implement the strategy of a long-term war, it is necessary to increase production. We must know that developed production is now the basis of the War of Resistance and the condition for a protracted war, and this developed production is what Mr. Sun said, "developing national industries," which is "creating state capital," which is also the process of practicing capitalism. Therefore, the Kuomintang, which is practicing the Three Principles of the People and leading the War of Resistance, must, in this era of the War of Resistance against Japan, have a planned and methodical way of making it state-owned. But in order to increase wartime financial resources and material resources, private capital can still be allowed to operate under the principle of state-owned enterprises. And this activity of private capital is not simply developing private capital; on the contrary, it is increasing the financial resources and material resources of the country, and assisting in the creation of state capital. Therefore, the declaration of the Kuomintang's National Congress said, "This War of Resistance is for the survival of the nation and the clan, and the interests of the nation and the people are greater than the interests of the individual. We must take the interests of the nation and the people as the common goal." This has determined the principle that the interests of the nation and the family are above all else in the stage of revolutionary war. At the same time, it also said: "During the War of Resistance, regarding economic construction, the government must implement a planned economy based on the tenets of the Principle of People's Livelihood. All undertakings that are suitable for state operation shall be raised by the state with capital and engaged in operation, so as to make them tend towards rationalization of production, and it must be controlled and coordinated, and set an example. Those that are in the form of private enterprises shall be run by private individuals at their own expense, and shall be developed in a beneficial way under the guidance and encouragement of the government under the overall plan of the state." Originally, China's private capital was very fragile. With the Japanese bandits' arbitrary destruction in addition to this, the so-called private capital has become even weaker and more powerless, while state capital is bound to grow day by day with the use of the Four Banks and the advancement of internal and external debts. In the economic law that large capital absorbs small capital, China's revolution, in its path towards capitalism and even its establishment, will never repeat the mistakes of European capitalism, and then reach the stage of socialism after another major bloodshed. In short, the Chinese revolution is to avoid the painful bloodshed of the capitalist revolution, that is, to end the feudal forces in the country and resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism by practicing the process of capitalism, and to use it as a means to achieve the goal of socialism. If we misunderstand this point, or do not understand the particularity of China, or are trapped in the error of mechanical theory in terms of method, and think that class struggle and proletarian revolution will still occur after the Chinese revolution, the Kuomintang, which is leading the War of Resistance, has already clearly pointed out the error in the declaration of the Provisional National Congress. It said: "Before the War of Resistance, the economic situation in China did not yet have the possibility of class struggle. During the War of Resistance, with everyone hating the enemy with the same hatred, class struggle is even more intolerable. After the victory of the War of Resistance, based on the planned economy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, the ideal of common ownership, common governance, and common enjoyment has already been close to realization, and there is even less need for class struggle." This is an established fact, and it is also a future fact. The Three Principles of the People's Chinese revolution is advancing based on this historical process.</p>
<p>The national revolutionary War of Resistance against Japan is the inevitable process of the Three Principles of the People's Chinese revolution. Our insistence on the War of Resistance is an insistence on revolution, and our efforts in the War of Resistance are efforts in revolution. Therefore, in this stage, advocating compromise, degenerating in life, and acting passively are all traitors to the nation and reactionaries of the revolution. In order to ensure that the War of Resistance will be victorious and the nation will be built, we only have to use the spirit of revolution and the means of revolution to remove all obstacles to the revolutionary war.</p>
<h3>Understanding the United Front of Chinese Youth (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Report from Xi'an</p>
<p>After the start of the War of Resistance, there were hundreds of small groups of young people in Wuhan, each with only dozens to hundreds of members. In order to commemorate the December 9th Movement, the more active Student Anti-Japanese Support Association of Wuhan University, the Fellow Students Association of Wuhan University, the Association of Exiled Students from North China, and the Anti-Japanese Education Research Association, together with small groups such as the Amateur Choir, the Qunsheng Choir, and the Jianyou Society, and students from various universities and middle schools, established the December 9th Commemoration Preparatory Committee. The December 9th Commemoration Conference was successfully held, and the Youth National Salvation Corps, which occupied an important position in the anti-Japanese work of young people in Central China, was thus born. The United Front work should not let go of any small opportunity for unity in action. Jointly holding discussion meetings, tea parties, welcome meetings, and memorial services are all forces that promote organizational unity. Organizational unity also needs to be gradual.</p>
<p>The unified New Life Promotion Association, the unified Zhongshan Hall, the unified Zhongzheng Room, and the unified National Revolutionary Room are all helpful for further unified organization.</p>
<p>Fifth, for the United Front to succeed smoothly, it is necessary to pay attention to the mutual cooperation between the upper and lower levels. All United Front work must be carried out with the assistance of the government or other upper-level figures. Even if it is misunderstood by some local authorities at times, it is necessary to use persistent and tireless efforts to turn misunderstanding into understanding in the end. On the other hand, it is impossible without a mass base at the lower level. This kind of empty United Front work, no matter how beautiful it looks on the surface for a while, will always be difficult to do any practical anti-Japanese work, and it will collapse sooner or later.</p>
<p>Sixth, in order to enrich the mass base of the United Front at the lower level, there must be appropriate improvements in the lives of young people. Only by relieving the suffering of the vast majority of young people as much as possible, generally improving the cultural and educational level of young people, and seriously protecting the various legitimate rights of young people can we consolidate the vast United Front of young people and consolidate the strength of the War of Resistance. Now, the lives of young people in Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces are already in the process of being improved, so the anti-Japanese forces of young people in these provinces are also relatively strong.</p>
<p>Seventh, the United Front must increase its vigilance against traitors and intensify the struggle against them. Because young people lack experience, they often mix into the ranks of young people to reverse right and wrong and create friction, which greatly hinders the work of the United Front. The main slogan of Japanese imperialism now is the so-called "anti-communist extermination of the party," so the main activities of traitors are also nothing more than opposing the Kuomintang, opposing the Communist Party, and opposing Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. However, different methods need to be used to deal with different types of traitors. Some are deceived and used, and these people can still be won over; some are major traitors, who are leaders, and they have already lost their qualifications to be Chinese and are absolutely hopeless. These people need to be severely punished.</p>
<p>Eighth, for some bad people who specialize in destroying youth unity, we cannot but pay attention to preventing and dealing with them for the sake of youth interests and anti-Japanese interests. Those few worst, conscienceless bad people, neither heaven nor earth nor the law nor human sentiment can tolerate them, and we cannot tolerate them either. If you tolerate them, or even help them, they will not tolerate you at all. They will use your tolerance and help to turn around and harm you. If you cannot eliminate obstacles, obstacles will come to eliminate you, annex you, and destroy you. The United Front is not completely without struggle; on the contrary, it develops from carrying out various necessary struggles. By carrying out this necessary struggle, first, we can make the masses understand that we are truly upright, benevolent, and righteous, and understand that those bad people are really evil thugs who are only afraid that the world will not be in chaos, and that they must be attacked by the masses. Second, it can also make these bad people, or get justice after all, and know that the human world will not allow them to run rampant, and that the youth United Front is a force that cannot be lightly humiliated or violated, so they will change their minds. Third, even if they are still unrepentant and willing to be at odds with the majority of people, they have to fail on their own because they are abandoned by everyone. Ninth, we must work harder to overcome various erroneous tendencies in our own youth.</p>
<p>One erroneous tendency is the tendency of closed-doorism and sectarianism. Their manifestations are: unwillingness to specifically analyze the objective situation at that time and place; unwillingness to patiently and humbly cooperate with the vast majority of young people outside their own group or other youth groups; only loving their own group and looking down on other groups; only taking into account local interests and neglecting the interests of the whole; only being obsessed with some beautiful and empty nouns, slogans, and articles, being arrogant, conceited, self-satisfied, not integrating with the masses, not trying to adapt to the environment, not going to work to review and learn, not having the great capacity to accommodate dissidents, not having the spirit of democratic work, and so on.</p>
<p>Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young people do not respect the living habits of farmers in the countryside, but wear straw sandals in the city to show their progress.</p>
<p>Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young officials donated money from a county magistrate to start a newspaper. On the first day, they criticized the county magistrate who donated the money in this newspaper. (Laughter)</p>
<p>Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young people in Shanxi must not establish a National Revolutionary Room, but must establish a National Salvation Room; when it is necessary to establish a National Revolutionary Room, the words "National Revolution" are written on the outside, but the inside is still for the National Salvation Room. (Laughter) Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some youth mass organizations stipulate that the procedures for participation must be introduced by how many people, fill out how many forms, swear to abide by how many harsh laws, and must be reviewed and approved by leadership agencies at all levels, all the way to the approval of the highest leadership agency.</p>
<p>Because of closed-doorism and sectarianism, some young people in Shaanxi even openly pointed out that the slogan of defending Shaanxi is a traitorous slogan, because the government is already defending Shaanxi, and the youth's proposal of this slogan is to doubt the government, which is "traitorous," and they may even be beaten.</p>
<p>But there is another tendency that is also extremely dangerous, that is, the tendency of surrenderism. Unprincipled concession is surrender. If we do not adhere to the correct principles of the United Front, and do not adhere to the correct principles that national rights, civil rights, and people's livelihood are inseparable, then it is shameful surrender. If we do not adhere to the exemplary role and critical attitude of the advanced, and do not adhere to our noble ideals and noble character, then it is shameful surrender. If we are afraid to carry out the necessary struggles with the forces that hinder our work, and waver when we see difficulties and dangers, and waver when we see fame, fortune, and the temptation of the opposite sex, then it is shameful surrender. We must resolutely oppose the tendency of surrender in the same way as we oppose closed-doorism and sectarianism.</p>
<p>We should thoroughly launch the struggle against closed-doorism, sectarianism, and surrenderism among the vast majority of young people. We should carry out systematic United Front education and various correct political theory education among the vast majority of young people. We should use all methods to cultivate the great courage and integrity of our young comrades. Our young people should be able to respect others, and at the same time, they should also be able to respect themselves. We must have the spirit of working together in harmony, and at the same time, we must also have the spirit of "a commoner cannot have his will taken away" and "a scholar can be killed but not humiliated." Only in this way can the future of the United Front be truly consolidated, and only in this way can there be hope for the future of our nation.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Unfold Along the Xiang River Bank; Successful Pursuit in Northern Hubei Yields Significant Gains; Enemy Troops Stir and Suffer Losses Near Dongting Lake</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] The enemy has invaded Central Hubei again, but the overall situation is under our control. According to a telegram from Shashi, a certain unit has approached the outskirts of Zhongxiang City. The enemy is stubbornly resisting with reinforcements, and the fighting is fierce. The enemy's attack on Yuekou was intercepted by us, and those invading Qianjiang have been surrounded and are being annihilated. Near Luohansi and Duobaowan, our troops are engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Two enemy regiments that launched a fierce attack on the Shangjiadian line a few days ago were engaged in a bloody battle for five days and nights, and more than a thousand enemy soldiers were annihilated by us. The Jiangxi front is quiet, and we have achieved successive victories on the shore of Dongting Lake in northern Hunan. More than 500 enemy soldiers in the vicinity were killed, with over 200 killed by us.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guilin, 1st] The momentum of our guerrillas near Guangzhou is growing daily. The enemy is transporting supplies to Henan. Fierce fighting is taking place near Niushan in Xijiang, where we have the upper hand and are currently attacking Jiangmen. More than a thousand enemy troops in Beijiang set out from Fengyong and opened up Huanshan Tou yesterday. We attacked them from multiple locations, and they retreated in disarray. The puppet army unit of Li Daoxuan suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by us. The remnants retreated to Jinxi.</p>
<p>Hubei-Henan Front</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai Dispatch, 1st] According to a Chinese report, the Chinese army in northern Hubei began an offensive yesterday, making significant progress. It is reported that the Japanese army is now retreating towards Yingcheng and the Pinghan Railway, abandoning a large number of heavy military equipment. It is estimated that over 100,000 Chinese troops are fighting in the Han River area.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to local newspapers, the Hunan-Hubei lines are quiet with no major battles, but there are occasional small skirmishes. Currently, the Chinese army is making every effort to attack Zhongxiang in an attempt to recapture it. The city and its suburbs have been surrounded by the Chinese army on three sides. However, because the highway from Zhongxiang to Jingshan is still in the hands of the Japanese army, they are currently able to send reinforcements to defend it. At the same time, there are still a large number of Japanese troops near Tianmen and Yuekou. Some believe that the Japanese army, which retreated from Dahong Mountain to Xinyang and Anlu, will attempt a large-scale attack on Xiangyang once they receive reinforcements from the rear. However, this speculation has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Yichang Dispatch, 1st] There have only been small skirmishes on the main Han-Yi road front in recent days. Our army is actively operating east of the Han River. The enemy that invaded Qianjiang a few days ago has now been surrounded by our army, and Yuekou is also under our combined attack.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, 1st] Our army is still active near Kaifeng. Yesterday, we bombed the enemy's ammunition depot east of the city and attacked the Liubeikou station on the Bianxin Road, capturing fourteen puppet workers. A part of the enemy in Taikang harassed Lecheng and the Wangtian Li area, but were severely attacked by us and fled to Zhangtianzhuang.</p>
<p>Northern Hunan Front</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Miluo Dispatch, 31st] The extremely tense situation in northern Hunan is currently focused on the original front line. Since the 21st of this month, in retaliation for our army's repeated attacks, the enemy dispatched a brigade of troops and attacked the north bank of the Xinqiang River in four routes: One from Matang attacking Tangjiapai, Yanjia Mountain, and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway; one from Xinkaitang attacking Qinggangyi and Longwanqiao along the ancient road from Yueyang to Xinqiang; one from Linxiang attacking Gengkouchaoxieling and Gantian along the ancient road from Taolin Xitang; and one landing from Dongting Lake at Matang to attack our front. All of these attacks have entered a state of chaos. The fierce fighting lasted until dusk. Except for the attack on the Gengkouchaoxieling route, where a small number of enemies sneaked across the north bank of the Xinqiang River and approached Xian'anqiao, all the others were repelled. On the 23rd, the enemy's full-line offensive suffered setbacks. Only Xian'anqiao was successful. They then focused on attacking Gengkouchaoxieling and Gantian on our right flank. Our army on that flank, relying on the favorable terrain obtained from Yue and Yu, waited for the enemy's offensive to gradually weaken before descending the mountain and engaging the enemy in a close-quarters bayonet fight, winning another major victory. The enemy collapsed completely. On the 31st, they changed their attack again to Tangjiapai and Yanjia Mountain on our left flank, but were once again defeated by a company of our troops in that area with ten times the enemy's strength, creating an unprecedented battle example since the start of the war. On the 25th, the enemy did not dare to continue the attack, as they were reorganizing their remnants all day. On the 26th, the enemy again divided their forces to attack our two flanks, focusing their attack on Tangjiapai and Yanjia Mountain on the left flank, attempting to break through at one point, but were still defeated by us. The line returned to silence on the 28th. As for the enemy ships that came from Dongting, they were suppressed by our firepower, making it difficult not only to achieve their landing attempts but also unable to get close to the shore. In total, the results of a week of fierce fighting showed that the enemy suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and we also suffered considerable sacrifices. We also captured many spoils of war, which are currently being inventoried. The enemy's offensive was originally intended to force our army on the north bank to withdraw south and "mop up" our guerrilla base. After a week of bloody battles, we have shattered their plan. The enemy is now consolidating their strongholds and strengthening fortifications, and are still in a passive position.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The Yueyang front in northern Hunan is also very quiet, as the Japanese army's attempts to cross the Xiang River have been driven back to the north bank. It seems they will abandon the offensive plan. According to Chinese newspapers, fierce fighting took place in the eastern suburbs of Yueyang, where over 500 Japanese soldiers were killed and the Chinese army captured 20 machine guns. This is indeed a great victory for the Chinese army in that area in recent months. Japanese warships in Dongting Lake have shelled Huarong several times and sent troops to land, but have never succeeded and have now ceased operations. According to military observers, since the Japanese army suffered a major defeat in the offensive in northern Hubei, it is difficult to predict the operational plans of the Japanese army in Hunan and Hubei. However, due to the silence on all fronts, no change in the war situation can be foreseen in the shortest term.</p>
<p>Shanxi-Suiyuan Front</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Yulin Dispatch, 30th] Since our unit launched guerrilla warfare last month, in addition to sabotaging railways and highways, it has also used swift action to attack the enemy's weaknesses. The enemy feels a major threat. Railway stations and key points on highways are only defended by heavy troops and mechanized units. In order to avoid the strong and attack the weak, we have advanced and retreated on multiple routes in the area between Taolin and Wuchuan north of the railway. In a few days, we have completely eliminated the enemy there and made contact with a certain cavalry unit of ours in northern Suiyuan. We are now making every effort to organize and train the masses, unite local guerrillas, and expand the guerrilla base.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Xi'an, 1st] Four enemy squadrons that invaded eastward from Quwo in southern Shanxi engaged in fierce fighting for days near Nanchang Town south of Yicheng, killing more than 1,000 enemy soldiers, including their regimental commander. The transportation near Jiexian has been completely destroyed by us. We captured Tumen, and a certain unit once attacked the outskirts of Linfen, killing many enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xingji Dispatch, 31st] There have been no major engagements near Xijing recently. The power lines in Hongdong Ba'an are often sabotaged by us. The local guerrillas north of Jishan have been successful, and the enemy's invasion of the countryside has been significantly hampered. The enemy's invasion of Zhangquan and other places in Zhaocheng suffered heavy losses from our guerrillas. Hundreds of enemy soldiers from Jingle invaded Yu County on the 21st and were engaged in a stalemate in the suburbs for a day and night, before finally defeating the enemy on the evening of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Important Talks Held by British, American, and French Ambassadors in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 31st] The British, American, and French ambassadors to China arrived in Shanghai one after another. They paid friendly visits to each other on the evening of the 29th and the morning of the 30th, and held talks at the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. According to sources in Shanghai, although the talks were not in the form of a meeting, their nature was very important. The naval commanders of the three countries also had close contact.</p>
<h3>Bao'an Military Police Praised for Meritorious Service in Defending Territory; Guangdong Provincial Government and Headquarters Issue Commendations Separately</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bao'an] Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Army Group, and Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, praised the magistrate of Bao'an County for effectively leading his troops to defend the territory during the recent enemy invasion of Bao'an County. Deputy Battalion Commander Jiang Xigu, Company Commander Hu Longbiao, Platoon Leader Ruan Bishan, and Sergeant Ma Fei were commended for their bravery in combat.

<h3>Measures for Implementing Standard Time in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch] Regarding the measures for implementing standard time throughout the country, the Ministry of Interior previously convened relevant agencies for discussion and decided that the Academia Sinica would be responsible for providing the time signal daily, and the Central Broadcasting Station would broadcast the report using both long and short wavelengths. All regions will implement it starting from June 1st. It is learned that the time reporting measures are as follows: (1) The national time is divided into five time zones: (A) The Central Plains Zone (i.e., Shanghai time) is based on the time at 120 degrees east longitude. (B) The Jinshu Zone (i.e., Chongqing time) is based on the time at 105 degrees east longitude. (C) The Huiqiang Zone is based on the time at 90 degrees east longitude. (D) The Kunlun Zone is based on the time at 82.5 degrees east longitude. (E) The Changbai Zone is based on the time at 127 degrees east longitude. During the Anti-Japanese War, all regions of the country will temporarily use the Longshu Zone time as the standard. (2) The Central Broadcasting Station will report daily at 3:00 AM using longwave with a frequency of 1200 kHz, call sign (XGOA), and shortwave with a frequency of 11900 kHz, call sign (XGOY), so that radio stations in various regions can receive and calibrate the time. Reports will be made at 6:00 PM (same frequency and call sign as above) so that listeners throughout the country can receive and calibrate the time. Reports will be made at 9:00 PM (same frequency and call sign as above) so that listeners overseas and in Southeast Asia can receive and calibrate the time. (All times listed above are based on the Central Plains Zone time).</p>
<h3>Consistent Stance of British, American, and French Ambassadors on Kulangsu Issue; Enemy Claims Improved Situation in the Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to Shanghai sources, the enemy claims that the submarine telephone cable between Xiamen and Kulangsu was cut by the British Taikang Foreign Company's steamship Anshun. The Japanese Consul General lodged a strong protest with the British Consulate at 10:00 AM on the 31st of last month. However, according to foreign sources, the British, American, and French ambassadors and the commanders of the Far East fleets are currently gathered in Shanghai to discuss the Kulangsu issue and will definitely take a consistent stance. Even if the enemy protests on the spot, they may not get what they want.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Japanese newspapers, the Japanese authorities and various diplomatic consuls have compromised on the issue of reforming the Kulangsu Municipal Council and have adopted a conciliatory attitude. Japanese Consul General Uchida visited the British and French consuls general separately for informal talks. The situation at the time was quite harmonious. Uchida then visited the Director-General of the Kulangsu Municipal Council, and both sides seemed to have begun to hold substantive negotiations on the five points proposed by the Japanese side.</p>

<h3>Japanese Demand Extradition of Cheng Case Murderer from British in Tianjin; British Embassy Military Attaché Detained by Japanese in Chahar</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, 1st] According to reports arriving here from Tianjin, Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Tanaka Hikogoro, sent a note to the British Consul General there, Jamieson, yesterday, demanding that the assassin who killed Cheng Xigeng, the puppet superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, be handed over to the Japanese authorities before noon on June 7th. Cheng was assassinated in a movie theater in the British Concession on April 9th. The Japanese side claims that the British authorities have not yet given a formal reply to the Japanese demand for the extradition of the murderer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] According to external Shanghai sources, Colonel Siple, the British Army Military Attaché at the Chinese Embassy, has been detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou. Colonel Siple traveled to the base area of the Eighth Route Army in the interior three months ago and originally planned to go to Peiping through the Japanese army's position. This time, he was detained by the Japanese side when he passed through the Japanese army's position.</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops on Hainan Island Suddenly Mutiny</h3>
<p>[South Route Express] The enemy implemented a sinister plan to use Chinese to control Chinese on Hainan Island, instigating the traitor Zhang to organize puppet troops. Many ignorant people were deceived into enlisting. After being given short-term training by the enemy, they were sent to various battlefields to fight. It was found that the first batch of more than 200 people was transported to Guangzhou in early May and distributed among various infantry units for replenishment. The second batch of more than 300 people was also continuously transported in mid-May. However, on the night before departure, they suddenly mutinied and mostly dispersed. Although the enemy tried to intercept them in all directions, it was ineffective.</p>
<p>[Xuwen Express] Although most of Hainan Island has ostensibly fallen, in reality, the enemy only forcibly occupies certain cities and towns. Our army and guerrillas are still distributed in the suburbs, tightly controlling the enemy and launching counterattacks at any time. The enemy is very afraid. It was found that on the 21st and 22nd of May, our troops attacked and entered Haikou again. At around 6:00 AM on the 21st, our guerrillas rushed to the outskirts and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Then, as the enemy sent in large reinforcements, we retreated due to being outnumbered. At around 5:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, we launched a second attack. This time, the arrangements were more thorough than before. A unit of plainclothes soldiers mixed into the enemy's airfield and burned dozens of cans of the enemy's gasoline. The enemy troops stationed in Haikou panicked and mobilized their entire force to search for us in an encirclement. As our objective had been achieved, we made a planned withdrawal. In this battle, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed, and we also suffered minor injuries to several people. Two brave men sacrificed heroically. The enemy's defenses are now very strict. Also, when we were in fierce fighting with the enemy, clear artillery fire was heard in Xuwen, Beihai.</p>

<h3>Enemy Assists Pirates in Disturbing Chao-Shan; Plots to Establish a Puppet "Overseas Chinese Army"; Bribes Fishermen to Spy on Our Military Situation; We See Through the Treachery and Take Precautions</h3>
<p>[Shantou Dispatch] The enemy attempts to occupy Chao-Shan with three parts military and seven parts political, (1) carrying out large-scale bombings to threaten our anti-Japanese spirit, (2) secretly sending traitors to infiltrate Chao-Shan to secretly establish forces to shake the social order, (3) bribing coastal fishermen to corrupt the military strongholds in various ports and bays from within. Our authorities see through their treachery and formulate precautions against it. Various counties and cities are expanding propaganda to strengthen the belief in resistance and deepen the common hatred of the enemy. The military, police, and civilian night meetings held in Shantou every week are used to blend the emotions of the military and civilians and to instill military and civilian political education, which has achieved obvious results. The coastal counties and cities such as Shantou, Chaoyang, Huilai are currently very active in purging the henchmen. Dozens of important traitors have been arrested in Shantou in the past half month and are being interrogated at the Garrison Command. The Raoping County Self-Defense Brigade recently surrounded and arrested bandits on the Fanzhou Houao sea and rescued six kidnapped people. They also seized the wanted bandits Chen Chai, Chen Shaozong, Lin Bing, Lin Shuangping, Huang Lin, and Zhang Yiming at the Jingpo boat. Initially, the crimes of the gangs were considered to be their first offenses. However, after being questioned by Huang 行署主任 Zeng Yeshi, it was discovered that there was a background of Japanese incitement. It has been reported that there have been times when bandit ships smuggled military ammunition from overseas into the Tuolin Haishan area. These people now have a conspiracy to establish a so-called "Overseas Chinese Army." Chen Zhuo, the magistrate of the county, has been informed of the report and has ordered his subordinates to take strict precautions. As for the enemy ships near the coast, they have been using both inducements and threats against our fishermen, saying that those who can exchange military intelligence for gold will enjoy the freedom to go out to sea for fishing, otherwise they will be killed without exception. Our authorities have also paid attention to this and are planning to actively strengthen the fishermen's will to resist the Japanese. The Fishermen's Advancement Association and the Fishermen's Advancement Team in various counties have recently been ordered to step up the organization of fishermen, and the coastal police have been ordered to strictly control the departure of fishing boats.</p>
<p>Starting from Xijing, I went east to Tongguan to inspect the Yellow River defense line; I went north to Yan'an to visit and participate in the achievements of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in resisting Japan and building the nation; and I listened nearby to the vivid strategies and tactics of our regular army and guerrillas in Shanxi working together, as well as the various "Post-Enemy Work" that our heroic soldiers and civilians are vigorously carrying out in other occupied areas - the only conclusion I have drawn from this coincides with what Chairman Chiang pointed out early in the spring when describing the characteristics of the second phase of the War of Resistance: "Changing from defense to offense, and turning defeat into victory." From the opposite perspective, the recent continuous bombings by enemy aircraft of our rear areas, such as Yichang, Fuzhou, Chengdu, and Nanzheng, especially Chongqing, the birthplace of resistance, are wanton acts of burning, bombing, and killing. This is a vicious act by the enemy to cover up their military failures (including the northern and southern battlefields), and it is also a reflection of our "changing from defense to offense, and turning defeat into victory" on the front line! Please see: These few articles that will continue to be published are practical materials that directly or indirectly answer this question.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ting-wen Discusses Northwest Military Affairs</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent on the Front Lines, Geng Ya</p>
<p>We know that the advantage of the Northwest's resistance against Japan, and the dividing point of the situation, lies in whether the hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in Shanxi can maintain their strength for a long time? Can it advance from maintaining its current state to a counter-offensive stage? If so, it will hold the advantage; otherwise, it will be at a disadvantage. This is an immutable principle. Because of the importance of Shanxi's position in the North China resistance, from the Niangziguan Pass eastward along the Zhengtai Railway, it can attack Shijiazhuang; and going north along the Pinghan Railway, it can attack Beijing, and southward it can attack Wuhan; from the Xuangmuguan Pass northward along the Tongpu Railway, it can recover Datong, and then advance eastward and westward along the Ping-Sui Railway, it can attack Chahar and Suiyuan and threaten the Puppet Manchukuo. As for its shielding of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and defending Sichuan and Australia, its significance is no less than the former. Looking back on the Shanxi war results of the past fourteen or five months (counting from the fall of Fenglingdu on March 17th last year), the enemy's so-called "mopping-up battles," "crossing-the-river battles," "attacking Xi'an and Lanzhou," and "cutting off international Sino-Soviet transportation," etc., which they loudly boasted about time and time again, have all been completely shattered by our heroic soldiers one after another. Moreover, recently, good news has been frequently reported, and they (heroic soldiers) have further recovered many cities and towns. In this way, Shanxi, with its advantageous terrain and the general military and civilians in Shanxi who have armored up for war, can be said to have brought their greatest strengths and capabilities into full play.</p>
<p>However, if we want Shanxi to continuously increase its new strength, in order to accomplish its greater mission in the future: to eliminate the enemy's presence within its borders and recover the lost territories of Hebei and Chahar, then the Northwest provinces, especially Shaanxi, which is separated by only a river, must support it and assist it, so that all soldiers and materials have a constant source of supply, and then it can smoothly complete its great mission. Therefore, the historian and geographer Gu Zuyu said: "Shaanxi's existence is crucial to the safety and stability of the nation." Now we can say it more realistically: "Shaanxi's existence is crucial to the victory or defeat of the Northwest war situation."</p>
<p>Since Shaanxi's position is so important, are its current preparations sufficient to shoulder this major mission? I think this is a question that everyone is closely concerned about. For this reason, I went to visit Generalissimo Chiang Ting-wen, Commander of the Xth War Zone and concurrently Chairman of Shaanxi Province - we had originally met in Zhangzhou, Southern Fujian, before the war. After meeting once, we became more familiar. This time, the conversation was very straightforward. His first sentence, "getting straight to the point," grasped the core of the issue and provided a powerful answer. He said:</p>
<p>"The purpose of the Northwest's military preparations at this stage is not only to consolidate the Northwest, but also to prepare for a counter-offensive against North China. A counter-offensive against North China is also a way to consolidate the Northwest. These have a mutually reinforcing effect. Of course, we must strive to make full achievements in reality!"</p>
<p>"To defend the Northwest and counter-attack North China, we must make full achievements in reality." These words, "appropriate and natural," coming from the mouth of General Chiang, who is solely responsible for the Northwest, are truly enough to boost our anti-Japanese sentiment and whip at the invading ambitions of the Japanese.</p>
<p>"Shaanxi has been divided into war zones, and all political facilities are moving in great strides along a bright path that coordinates with the needs of the war of resistance." Chiang, with his calm speaking manner, seemed to have left the high seat of "Commander-in-Chief" and was sitting leisurely in the position of "Chairman of Shaanxi Province" to speak: "In terms of economic resources, we can also support a long-term war of resistance. Daily necessities for people's livelihood, such as grain and fuel, can be self-sufficient. If there is a shortage, it can be imported and supplemented by Sichuan and Ningxia provinces. The production of cloth and cotton is particularly large. In addition to consumption in the province, it can also be exported to Sichuan in large quantities. War refugees are constantly coming to Shaanxi from the Longhai Railway. The Anti-Japanese Support Association is providing relief, and we do not feel any great difficulties. This is also because the daily necessities are locally sourced and readily available. In particular, last year's cotton and wheat harvests were unprecedented in nearly ten years. The Yellow River did not freeze in winter, which strengthened our river defenses. This spring, the rain and snow were well-distributed, which foretells another bumper harvest. Such favorable weather conditions year after year will certainly help enhance our national defense capabilities.</p>
<p>"The Northwest has a vast territory, and the front lines stretch for hundreds of miles. Regarding transportation, although automobiles and gasoline are sometimes scarce, the Northwest has horse-drawn carriages, ox-carts, and thousands of camel caravans. If we organize and utilize them well, we can still cope with military transportation with ease." The reporter often encounters such large military transports of vehicles and horses on the ground. I once thought that if we could have a high-altitude view of the Northwest, we would definitely be able to see on major highways such as Xi'an-Lanzhou, Xi'an-Yulin, Suiyuan-Ningxia, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Gansu-Xinjiang a constant stream of vehicle and horse transport teams, like ants moving house, bustling along. Sometimes, there are also beetle-like cars, speeding in between, working equally hard for the country's troubles. What a great and beautiful wartime military transportation picture! However, if this picture were to be presented to those who "don't give a damn about national affairs" and to traitors and national criminals, it would be a cold and ironic cartoon, because it would make them deeply feel a sense of inferiority!</p>
<p>"Regarding the issue of soldiers, Shaanxi Province has already conscripted tens of thousands of soldiers, but the people have always enthusiastically enlisted without any complaints." Chiang continued, pleased with himself: "For example, in the model conscription experimental zone of Nanzheng (Hanzhong), there are strong men who could not be selected by lottery, and they even jointly submitted a written request to the county government, asking them to be allowed to enlist early and fulfill their desire to kill the Japanese. Also, cities such as Xi'an, Tongguan, Yulin, and Nanzheng have been repeatedly bombed and ravaged by Japanese aircraft, causing heavy losses to the lives and properties of some civilians, but the general anti-Japanese sentiment has been boosted by the bombing, and the confidence in victory has become stronger with each battle.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Three People's Principles, the traditional spirit of the Sanqin people, who have been brave in public warfare since ancient times, has been promoted and developed today to attack the Japanese invaders' attempt to invade the west. This is not an extravagant hope that transcends reason, but a natural product of the marriage of history and reality.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, speaking of the geographical environment of Guanzhong: the Yellow River is a natural barrier, and it is a fact before our eyes. It is really difficult for the Japanese to fly over it. If they use the old trick of Han Xin and Liu Bang entering Guanzhong, they would first seize our strategic location in western Henan, then go north to Luoyang, or west to Jingziguan, and then join forces in Guanzhong. However, using the Luoyang route, there is the obstruction of Mount Song; going west to Jingziguan, there is the danger of Mount Funiu. It is more suitable to defend than to attack, even more so than the Yellow River's natural barrier. Assuming that the Japanese really have a large force and concentrate their attack on the Yellow River or any other route for three or four months, and do not pay a heavy price, and are lucky enough to break through and enter, Shanxi has hundreds of thousands of our troops pressing hard on its tail in the rear, constantly threatening and cutting off its connection. As a result, it will inevitably solve that batch of isolated troops that have gone deep into the distance completely.</p>
<p>"The Japanese naturally deeply feel the greatness of the threat of our army in Shanxi. They cry and shout slogans such as 'mopping up' and 'sweeping away.' But we have already added a large number of reinforcements to the border defenses, and launched attacks on the remnants of the Japanese on all fronts, putting them separately in a passive position. Therefore, the military strategy of the Northwest, which aims to protect the Northwest and counter-attack North China, is not only based on subjective necessity, but also has objective conditions for success."</p>
<p>Finally, judging from the recent avalanche of good news from the northern battlefield, it shows that Chiang's great theory of "defending the Northwest" and "counter-attacking North China" is gradually evolving into gratifying facts there.</p>

<h3>Molotov's Speech: The Soviet Union Earnestly Aids China, Intolerance for Japanese Provocations on the Border, Negotiations with Britain Continue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, delivered an important speech to the joint session of the Nationalities Council and the Council of the Union of the Supreme Soviet at 7:00 PM today (local time), mentioning the draft of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement proposed by Britain and France, stating that although its content is further advanced than the previous proposals of those countries, the Soviet Union is still not satisfied. He also mentioned relations with Japan, saying that the Soviet Union has a mutual assistance treaty with Outer Mongolia and will definitely protect it. He also mentioned relations with China, saying that Stalin once stated that the Soviet Union is willing to help countries that have been invaded, and in the case of China, we have earnestly done so.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in a speech last night, addressed border issues, stating that the countries involved should know that the Soviet Union will not tolerate Japanese puppet troops provoking on its borders. We must warn them that this also applies to the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic. In accordance with the mutual assistance agreement signed with the Mongolian People's Republic, we consider it our duty to provide the necessary assistance to that country in order to maintain its borders. We attach great importance to the matters stipulated in the mutual assistance pact signed by the Soviet Union. I now warn again that, in accordance with this pact, we will resolutely defend that border, just as we do our own country. The Japanese claim that the Mongolian People's Republic has invaded Japan is absurd and ridiculous. Our patience is also limited, and this is what should be recognized today. Japanese puppet troops frequently violate the Soviet-Mongolian border and should be stopped immediately. We have already issued this warning to the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union. Speaking about the Soviet Union's attitude towards China, Molotov continued, "You are familiar with Stalin's declaration regarding assistance to countries that have been invaded and are fighting for national independence. This declaration now fully applies to China, which is fighting for national independence. We are constantly implementing this policy." Molotov also stated that this is fully in line with the Soviet Union's work in Europe to unite peaceful countries to form a common front against aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 31st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech in the Soviet Parliament today, expressing that there are still some points to be reserved regarding the suggestions of Britain and France, as they are sufficient to make the tripartite agreement ineffective. He stated, "The Soviet Union insists that the tripartite agreement must be of an absolute defensive nature, guaranteeing all the neighbors of the Soviet Union, and a substantial mutual assistance agreement when any signatory country is attacked. "The Soviet Union thoroughly advocates uniting all peace-loving countries to resist aggression, but we must keep in mind the warning issued by Stalin, that is, we cannot let ourselves pick chestnuts out of the fire for others." When Molotov spoke to this point, the representatives cheered thunderously. Stalin, Voroshilov, Litvinov, and other members of the Politburo also joined in the applause when Molotov declared that the Soviet Union absolutely insisted on equality, lasting for five minutes. Molotov continued, "Our position has reached the ranks of the leading powers." He also said that the recent suggestions of Britain and France have recognized mutual responsibility, "This is indeed a step forward," but he further pointed out that the Baltic countries have not yet been guaranteed, because the Soviet Union cannot bear any responsibility for those who remain neutral but are unable to defend their neutrality. Molotov said that negotiations with Britain are still ongoing, "Once we insist on our point of view, this is not necessary to discuss with anyone else. Aggressor countries have long recognized the Soviet Union's foreign policy, that is, to oppose aggression, while democratic countries have only recently recognized this. We have recently witnessed a change in Britain's attitude, and therefore accepted its request to conduct negotiations." During Molotov's speech, he extensively condemned aggressor countries, and also mentioned the improved Soviet-Italian relations. He said, "We never refuse to improve our trade relations with Germany." The Soviet-German commercial negotiations that were previously conducted, although temporarily interrupted, now show signs of resumption.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, made a speech this evening, the main points of which are as follows: Regarding the issue of the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the original suggestions of Britain and France were not based on the principle of equal reciprocity, so the Soviet Union was not satisfied. Although the latest suggestion has been based on mutual principles and is more advanced than before, the various reservations attached to it make the so-called progress still superficial. In addition, if the three small neighboring countries to the northwest of the Soviet Union (probably referring to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) are invaded in the future, and are not strong enough to resist, can Britain and France assist the Soviet Union and protect them together? This question is not explicitly stipulated in the Anglo-French draft. Although our country loves peace and supports resistance to aggression, we are determined not to be used by others, as stated by Stalin beforehand. As far as German-Soviet commercial negotiations are concerned, although they have failed at this time, they may still be resumed in the future, especially in the anti-aggression struggle, our country's commerce should stand at the forefront. As for the Soviet Union and Poland, bilateral relations have been improved, because last year we entered the alliance, and this year we re-signed a commercial agreement to develop trade relations. As for the issue of the fortification of the island of Oland in the Baltic Sea, the armaments that can be placed on that island may be largely used to the detriment of the Soviet Union. This issue should not exclude the Soviet Union. At this point, Molotov explained the conditions advocated by the Soviet Union regarding cooperation with Western European countries as follows: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should conclude a truly effective agreement; (2) Britain and France should provide guarantees to all neighbors of the Soviet Union, regardless of their affiliations; (3) The agreements among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should stipulate mutual assistance measures to resist aggression. Then he mentioned the alliance treaty between Italy and Germany, saying that this treaty belongs to the nature of aggression, and Italy and Germany may incite aggressive wars. In the past, the so-called need to fight against the Comintern is no longer mentioned. Observing the provisions of the German-German alliance treaty, it does not involve the anti-Comintern pact, then this alliance is clearly aimed at the democratic countries. At this time, appeasement should no longer be discussed. Our country does not sympathize with the aggressor countries at all. On the contrary, we believe that the truth and the real situation should be made public, and should not be decorated and concealed, otherwise it will only benefit those who are unwilling to curb aggression. At this time, Britain has established a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, and the Anglo-Turkish agreement will be established. Britain and France are conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union, which shows that the attitude of Western European countries has been improved. If these countries can prove their sincerity in resisting aggression, then the Soviet Union will naturally be willing to establish an agreement with them, but it is also unwilling to be exploited by others. In short, our country should protect its own interests and the general interests of peace, and we also know what to choose between empty words and facts. After Molotov finished his speech, all the parliamentarians cheered and praised, and it lasted for a long time. At this point, the third regular meeting of the Supreme Soviet was declared closed.</p>
<h3>Impression of London: Although there are differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union, they are only formal and not substantial</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has just learned that London has now received the full text of Molotov's speech. The British official impression of this speech is that the differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union are formal rather than substantial. The importance of this formal issue cannot be stated until the Soviet government receives an actual reply from the British side. As for the part related to the League of Nations, it is believed that countries that so enthusiastically support the principles of the League of Nations will not have any serious differences of opinion. Regarding the Baltic countries and the issue of guarantees, Britain believes that every country has the right to safeguard its territorial integrity and independence, and all acts of aggression are abhorred by Britain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] This morning's newspapers published opinions on Molotov's speech, generally believing that the speech did not hinder the final and satisfactory conclusion of the anti-aggression agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The Times and the Daily Telegraph closely noted the points of concern of Molotov, namely (1) the connection between the Anglo-French proposal and the League of Nations Covenant, and (2) the status of the Baltic countries. The Times stated, "Although the British and French governments seek the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, this is not to say that the agreement to be established should be hindered and damaged by any consultations with the members of the League of Nations Executive Council." The Daily News believes that the status of the Baltic countries is the most difficult outstanding issue, but this difficulty, although serious, is not insurmountable.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Today, the diplomatic correspondent of The Times declared that London's impression of Molotov's speech is that the differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union are only formal and not substantial. It is believed here that Moscow has an understanding that London is too confident that its subsequent proposals will meet all requirements. Molotov stated that before the final signing of the agreement, every point of view of the Soviet Union must be carefully considered. The impression here is that Molotov's speech did not mention that the conclusion of an agreement was impossible.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 1st] The Daily News stated today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech "is really disappointing, because the opinion of one insider believes that in addition to some details that still need to be adjusted, the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has actually been completed." The Daily Telegraph stated, "Judging from Molotov's speech, some difficulties and misunderstandings have not been completely eliminated. The Soviet Foreign Minister expressed dissatisfaction because he was still unable to implement the principle of mutual response. His statement is to show that there are still some gaps between Britain and the Soviet Union, which must be filled before a final agreement can be concluded."</p>
<h3>France Remains Optimistic: Believes Agreement Will Ultimately Be Established; Difficult Points Can Be Discussed and Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 31st] In Molotov's speech, he adopted a reserved attitude towards the recent proposals of Britain and France. Political figures in France are not alarmed by this. They believe that the agreement will ultimately be established. What remains to be discussed is only the details. The Soviet reply is expected to be received this Thursday and will be studied quickly and carefully. People here believe that there are two main difficulties for the Soviet Union with the Anglo-French proposals: (1) The mutual assistance agreement must be in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the sanctions clause); (2) The Soviet Union hopes to provide protection to its Baltic neighbors. People here believe that it is not difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet government on these two points, so the final conclusion of the agreement is only a matter of time.</p>

Madame Tabouis, in her article in the "Labor News," welcomed Berlotov's speech and predicted that the tripartite agreement could be signed within the next week.

<p>[Central News Agency, Hamburg, 1st] German volunteer soldiers who participated in the Spanish Civil War arrived in Hamburg yesterday. Accompanying them to Germany were three Spanish general-level officers.</p>

<h3>America Determined to Uphold Far Eastern Interests, Joining Efforts to Restore Balance of Power, Opposing Disruption of Open Door Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] According to authoritative sources, as a result of recent developments, the United States will ultimately participate in any effort to restore the balance of power in the Far East. Although most Western nations have passively accepted Japan's Monroe Doctrine in East Asia in the past, there are now signs that third countries (including the United States) will insist on their rights and not relax their grip when concrete final arrangements are made regarding land and commercial privileges. Foreign experts believe that the Gulangyu Incident is the most instructive example. This incident involved Japan undermining international conventions, and the countries concerned took joint action to deal with it. When Japanese troops invaded Gulangyu, the navies of Britain, France, and the United States carried out armed landings. Informed sources believe that the reason why Western countries concerned suddenly took this action was because they believed that the Gulangyu Incident would be used by Japan to test reactions to any future actions regarding the Shanghai International Settlement. Diplomatic circles here believe that after the end of the Sino-Japanese War, a final solution will be reached. Regardless of the outcome of this war, the sphere of influence in the Far East must be re-determined. Issues such as China's extraterritorial rights, public concessions, open door policy, commercial privileges, and Yangtze River navigation will be raised for international discussion. The United States will insist on its position. The general public in the United States has reacted favorably to the Gulangyu Incident, which shows support for the government's current Far Eastern policy. Experts believe that if Japan attempts to undermine the open door policy and extraterritorial rights, it will certainly encounter strong opposition from the United States.</p>

<h3>Japan Withdraws from the International Labor Bureau, Tokyo Branch Closed, Rumor is That It Will Establish Its Own Organization</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 31st] Japan today formally announced its withdrawal from the International Labor Bureau. The Tokyo branch of the International Labor Bureau closed yesterday. The Japanese chief of the branch made a statement, saying that the closure of the branch was not due to any discord with the International Labor Bureau, but was caused by the current international situation. Japan is now in an unavoidable situation and has no choice but to establish its own labor bureau.</p>
<p>[Geneva, 31st] After Japan announced its withdrawal from the International Labor Bureau, the chief of the bureau, Mr. Winant, issued a report, describing in detail the world situation of expanding armaments, stating: "If any country spends most of the income from free production on military expenditures and expansion, the standard of living will immediately decrease.

<p>A brief commentary</p>
<h3>Molotov's Report</h3>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reported on Soviet foreign policy at the Soviet parliament on the evening of May 31. First, he loudly warned the Japanese authorities about the provocation of the Japanese puppet troops against Outer Mongolia. Then, he clearly declared that the Soviet Union would actively implement aid to China. These two points are particularly noteworthy. They not only exposed the smokescreen of the Japanese puppet troops' provocation against Outer Mongolia, but also increased our infinite confidence and courage in insisting on united resistance against Japan. Moreover, they clearly declared that the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining peace and aiding invaded countries fighting for national independence is equally applicable to Europe and the Far East. This can be regarded as a major blow to the conspiracies of Japan and other countries to maliciously slander the Soviet Union and alienate the cooperation of democratic and peace-loving countries such as China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.</p>
<p>At the same time, Molotov solemnly stated the attitude towards the negotiations on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. After acknowledging that Britain and France had made progress on their anti-aggression policies, he clearly pointed out the shortcomings and solemnly declared that "the Soviet Union can never be used as a cat's paw." Molotov's report gave a considerable warning to those who were generally empty, noisy, and optimistic about the anti-aggression front, and at the same time gave a blow to those who were maliciously pessimistic about the movement for Anglo-French-Soviet cooperation. We hope that Britain, France, and other countries concerned will recognize the serious situation of the fascist aggressors' active offensive, recognize that all opportunistic and even hypocritical policies will only increase the current crisis, and quickly take steps to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the same boat, trusting and helping each other, in order to sanction [illegible].</p>

In addition to briefly reporting on the preparations, she also thanked all sectors of society. The original speech said:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, [illegible] is deeply troubled, the national crisis is in full swing, and there are more than millions of wounded soldiers and refugees. Relief work should be actively carried out. However, using limited money to run unlimited charities only increases the feeling of a drop in the bucket. Therefore, the charity performance organized this time is based on this broad relief as a starting point. At the same time, we have received enthusiastic support and enthusiastic participation from men and women alike. The formal opening is today. (He or she) sings a loud noise on the stage with effort, simply hoarsely, calling for wounded soldiers and refugees. Entertainment does not forget to save the country, which is our only slogan.</p>

<p>Famous Play "Diao Chan" Shocked the Audience</p>
<p>After the chairman's speech, the drums and music played loudly, and the curtain was raised. The famous play "Diao Chan," which promotes patriotism and eradicates traitors, is very suitable for today's public opinion of resisting Japan. Therefore, when Miss Pang Lian'ai, who plays Diao Chan, prays to heaven, "May heaven punish the traitors and not cause suffering to the living," the audience applauds thunderously. The atmosphere in the audience is extremely tense, and the sound of drums and music is almost covered. In terms of art, it is of course exquisite. At the same time, the audience's [illegible] mood of saving the country is surging. They all hold the indignation of "One day the Japanese bandits are destroyed, and we will perish together."

<p>Lai Chi Kok Hospital (Soldiers): 16, 12</p>

<p>Total: 40999, 4091</p>
<h3>Funerals in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Funerals in Hong Kong are divided into old-style, new-style, and religious-style. Old-style funerals also vary depending on wealth. Poor people have a simple coffin, carried by four laborers, with two people playing the flute and drum, a "single flute," which looks very pitiful.</p>
<p>The rich, however, hold grand affairs, with extended processions, hundreds of cars following behind, the mourners traveling in a "car river" for the funeral procession, which looks very lively.</p>
<p>For middle- and upper-class families: the procession often includes several mourning pavilions, green pavilions, flower pavilions, two or three roadside offerings, a band of "Rudian music" – adding point music is grand music, each band costing more than ten dollars – or even a foreign band; a "Piaose" float, several foreign bands, monks, Taoists, and nuns in a procession; the "Path Clearing God" is over ten feet tall, a grand spectacle like a parade, taking a whole hour to pass, though these are becoming less common.</p>
<p>The funeral bands are the most mixed, with Western music followed by Chinese music, and also "Ma Bu Chui" (a type of wind and percussion ensemble), head gong, Beijing gong, and eight-sound percussion cabinet, creating a nonstop din, beating loudly enough to shake the town.</p>
<p>Each member of a Western band costs $1.20, and a standard band costs twenty to thirty dollars. They are not necessarily skilled musicians, and being out of sync is common, and in funerals, they often play tunes like "The Merry Widow," which is quite comical!</p>
<p>Of course, there are also very skilled bands, and military bands can be hired to perform, but the cost is staggering, not less than three hundred dollars per band, with specific times and included drinks.</p>
<p>Recently, after the fall of Guangzhou, the "Changjiao Museum National Orchestra" has flowed into Hong Kong, and perhaps out of novelty, funerals are no exception! This type of orchestra is very popular, and many people hire them. Each member costs $1.20, and a team of twenty or more people costs about twenty-four dollars.</p>
<p>New-style funerals mostly use a Western band, with a hearse carrying the coffin, going straight to the cemetery for burial, which is very simple and solemn.</p>
<p>These funeral vehicles vary in size and price, with smaller ones costing twenty dollars and larger ones thirty dollars.</p>
<p>Religious-style funerals are similar to new-style funerals, but often use horse-drawn hearses, and the filial sons do not wear mourning clothes; the burial is in a religious cemetery, without monks, but with a teacher praying.</p>
<p>Funerals in Hong Kong are different in that there are mourning sheds. Many living people in Hong Kong live in four- or five-story buildings, and when they die, they need to invite a carpenter to build a three- or four-story-high shed. This shed has a narrow, sloping path made of bamboo and wooden boards, used to transport the coffin, because coffins should not pass over thresholds; those living downstairs do not like the coffin passing in front of their doors or stairs; and at the same time, the sloping, narrow, dim, and winding stairs of Hong Kong buildings cannot realistically allow the coffin to be carried up and down. This type of mourning shed costs ten dollars per floor, i.e., ten dollars for the second floor, twenty dollars for the third floor, and so on.</p>
<p>The second point is superstition. When someone dies, that evening, Buddhist nuns, monks, or Nam Mo masters are invited to chant the "upside-down scripture," which costs more than ten dollars. Afterwards, every seven days, Buddhist nuns, monks, or Nam Mo masters must be invited to perform a ritual and chant scriptures; usually, the first, third, fifth, and last few "sevens" are performed. Wealthy families perform the ritual on every "seven," so-called "seventy-seven days without falling banners," which means that a "ghost-attracting banner pole" and "ritual crane" are erected on each "seven," and scriptures are chanted to perform "merit."</p>
<p>Performing rituals is known to be "spending money for merit," and monks, nuns, and Nam Mo masters each cost thirty to fifty dollars. The paper offerings are even harder to calculate, because large mansions, steamships, and even the latest 1939 model cars, horses, and airplanes can be made by paper offering shops, and it is common to spend three to five hundred dollars on paper offerings for each ritual. Burning paper offerings requires renting a small iron house, which also costs ten dollars to rent.</p>
<p>Because of superstition, many people who "eat from all directions" benefit greatly. Coffin shops, nunneries, Zen monasteries, Taoist temples, etc., all make a lot of money. Not to mention other things, just take "spiritual placement" as an example! Because in Hong Kong, several families live in one floor, if unfortunately one family has a death, the landlord and other residents on the floor do not like the bereaved family to set up a shrine in the building to perform "seven" rituals. In this situation, people have no choice but to place the shrine (i.e., the spirit tablet) in a coffin shop, nunnery, Zen monastery, or Taoist temple. Each spirit tablet costs at least twenty dollars, and nunneries and Zen monasteries, with more elaborate displays, cost no less than thirty to fifty dollars. In coffin shops, a five-foot-long table can hold five or six spirit tablets, and the shop can easily place seven or eight tables, so more than eight hundred dollars can be earned without any capital, which is the best business possible. In a city with a growing population and high mortality rate, it is their opportunity.</p>
<p>Besides these two points, there is hypocrisy and elaborate rituals not found in ancient rites.</p>
<p>Like hiring "successors to carry banners and buy water" and "professional filial sons"; hiring "wailing women" who specialize in mourning for others… all of which are hypocritical.</p>

<p>Shanghai Special</p>
<h3>A Brief Chronicle of Ten Years of Greater Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xuan Nan</p>
<p>Shanghai was established on July 7th, 1927, initially named the Shanghai Special Municipality, directly under the National Government. Huang Fu was appointed as the first mayor of the city. After assuming office, Mayor Huang followed the "Provisional Regulations for the Shanghai Special Municipality" promulgated by the National Government, appointing secretaries and bureau chiefs to take charge of various agencies. The Secretariat, Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Education Bureau, Land Bureau, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Bureau, and Public Welfare Bureau were successively established to manage municipal affairs. Various regulations were drafted, announced, and implemented for compliance; and the scope of the municipal area was delineated and submitted to the National Government to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to send personnel to jointly survey the area, clarifying jurisdiction and rights. After Huang's service for two months, he requested retirement due to a relapse of an old illness. The National Government then appointed Zhang Dingfan as his successor, who took office on September 16th. For the sake of conserving administrative expenses, Mayor Zhang abolished the Public Welfare Bureau at the end of September, transferring all matters handled by the bureau to other bureaus according to their nature. He then proceeded to delineate the powers of the province and the city, determine the scope of the municipal administrative area, and receive the municipal and rural areas of the two counties of Shanghai and Baoshan, uniformly renaming them as areas.</p>
<p>On July 3rd, 1928, the National Government promulgated the Organizational Law of Special Municipalities, and the municipal government began to implement reorganization in accordance with it from August 1st. In addition to renaming the Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Bureau as the Social Affairs Bureau, the other bureaus remained the same. On December 25th, the Port Affairs Bureau was established to handle matters related to the city's rivers, harbors, coastlines, wharves, and ships.</p>
<p>In March 1929, Mayor Zhang also resigned due to illness, and Zhang Qun succeeded him. After assuming office on April 1st, Mayor Zhang focused on reorganizing and transforming the existing construction of the old urban area and demarcated the central urban area to vigorously promote the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great plan. On May 20th of the following year, the National Government promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, renaming all special municipalities as cities directly under the Executive Yuan. The municipal government began to change its name to Shanghai City in accordance with it from July 1st of the same year and implemented reorganization. Except for the Port Affairs Bureau, which was ordered to be suspended and abolished in December of the same year, the internal organization of the bureaus was slightly changed, but the names remained the same. On July 7th, 1936, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new municipal government building in the central urban area was held, and construction began, originally scheduled to be completed the following year. Later, due to changes in the situation, Mayor Zhang resigned due to illness in January of the following year and left.</p>
<p>On January 7th, 1932, Wu Tiecheng was ordered to succeed as mayor. Shortly after Mayor Wu took office, the January 28th Incident occurred, lasting for more than three months, and the essence of the urban area was greatly destroyed. He then devoted his efforts to relieving disaster areas, pacifying refugees, and struggling through difficulties. At the same time, in view of the vastness of the urban area and the difficulty of maintaining public security, the Municipal Security Office was established on August 1st. The work of reconstruction and completing the construction of the central urban area continued to advance in order to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai. In October of the following year, the Municipal Government Building was completed, and Mayor Wu scheduled the completion ceremony to be held at 10:00 AM on National Day. In December, the Municipal Government moved into the office.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, 1934, the Municipal Government held an opening ceremony, celebrated the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, and held an enlarged commemorative group and New Year's group worship ceremony. In order to promote the prosperity of the central urban area, the various modern urban facilities began to be implemented one by one. In addition to widening roads and opening parks for the convenience of citizens' recreation, other important projects such as libraries, museums, stadiums, gymnasiums, swimming pools, police academies, health experiment stations, elementary school staff, wireless broadcasting stations, and the Qiujiang Wharf were all built successively.</p>
<p>In 1935, libraries, museums, stadiums, hospitals, health experiment stations, elementary schools, etc., were completed one after another. The elementary schools opened in February, and the stadium was transferred to the Preparatory Committee of the 6th National Games in September. The 6th National Games were held from October 10th to 20th. The central urban area was bustling with traffic and reached its peak. After the closing of the Games, the Municipal Government took over and implemented the opening after verifying the organizational regulations to provide a place for citizens' sports competitions. From 1936 until the fall of Shanghai, the libraries, museums, hospitals, health experiment stations, etc., were equipped and opened one after another. The Shanghai Municipal Sports College was also established in the stadium. The first phase of the Qiujiang Wharf construction project was also completed and opened first. Other construction projects, such as the construction of the Longhua Scenic Area, the establishment of the Pudong Water Plant, and the expansion of the user lines in the central urban area of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, were all being realized or underway. Who would have known that the establishment anniversary of Shanghai City on July 7th would be chosen by the Japanese as the day to create an incident to launch a war of aggression against China, and who would have known that more than a month after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Shanghai War would break out! In March, the chairman of Guangdong Province passed away, and the National Government ordered Mayor Wu to succeed as chairman, and the position of Shanghai mayor was still temporarily held by Yu Hongjun. After the outbreak of the war, Yu was ordered to be the mayor, commanding the citizens to rise up against the Japanese. After four months of resistance, Shanghai was eventually occupied. However, the morale of the Shanghai citizens has not declined to this day. They all believe that the final victory will belong to our country, and Greater Shanghai will eventually be restored by the Chinese people of Shanghai. The revival of Greater Shanghai will still be operated and completed by the Chinese people themselves.</p>
<h3>Flower and Whispers</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Claims to Have Confiscated Two Alleys on Yu Yuan Road</p>
<p>The Japanese side hosted Western reporters on the afternoon of the 22nd and was asked to explain the posting of notices in two alleys on Yu Yuan Road (Zhongshi New Village and Siming Villa) prohibiting residents from moving in and out. The spokesperson claimed that the properties were the property of enemy countries and had been confiscated by the Japanese authorities. When asked whether the two Chinese banks to which the properties belonged were government agencies, the spokesperson replied that he did not know but that all properties owned by agencies or individuals working for the Chinese government were confiscated. A similar notice was issued when Chinese properties on Hongkou Road were confiscated. When asked whether residents would be allowed to move in and out after the confiscation was completed, the spokesperson replied that this would depend on the situation. When the matter was inquired about by public concession police officers, they claimed that the area was outside their jurisdiction and therefore had not been investigated.</p>
<p>The First Shanghai Map</p>
<p>This map is from the first Shanghai County Chronicle, the Ming Hongzhi Shanghai Chronicle, so it is also the first Shanghai map, drawn more than 430 years ago.</p>
<p>Monk's Six Senses Not Clean, Iron Window Flavor for One Year</p>
<p>Yingzhao, the abbot of Baobentang on Mount Putuo in the South China Sea, is in his sixties and has extensive social connections, appearing to be the leading figure among monks. The Baobentang on Changsha Road in Shanghai is also presided over by him. Every time he comes to Shanghai from Ningbo, he stays at this temple. In the past, there was a wealthy merchant named Sun who was very devout in Buddhism and had a close relationship with the abbot. In 1935, Sun's business failed, and his family property was exhausted. Helpless, his son Yao bin and daughter-in-law Jiang Meili went to Mount Putuo to seek shelter with Yingzhao. Yingzhao inquired about their situation and generously took them in, allocating a building next to the temple for them to live in. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, Sun Yaobin resolutely joined the army, entrusting his elderly father and beloved wife to Yingzhao. When he took leave to visit his relatives in January of this year, he found that his father was still there, but his wife was gone. He asked his father, only to learn that the great monk's six senses were not clean, and he had been tempted by her beauty, secretly taking Jiang away from the mountain and fleeing to the sea. Yaobin learned that the monk was so shameless and immediately pursued him to Shanghai, repeatedly investigating Baobentang on Changsha Road without success. It was not until noon on May 21st that he learned that the great monk's secret residence was upstairs at No. 48 Wenzhou Road. He reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives went to the address and arrested the two while they were still in bed. They were sent to the First Special District Local Court the next day. Yingzhao still tried to deny the charges and hired a lawyer to defend himself. Sun Yaobin's affection for his wife was deep, and he asked that Jiang be spared prosecution. After Judge Zhong Qing questioned them, he sentenced Yingzhao to one year of imprisonment for adultery with a married woman. Jiang Meili's part was not accepted. Yingzhao, upon hearing the verdict, still asked to be released on bail, but was rejected and taken away by the detectives.</p>
<p>Bodyguard's Gun Discharges, Rumored to Be Wang Jingwei's Residence</p>
<p>A Western-style house at No. 570 Avenue , French Concession, is guarded by twenty bodyguards. Whenever a car enters or exits, several armed men accompany it. At 4:00 PM on the 26th, a bodyguard named Wu Changzhi was cleaning his gun in the bedroom when it accidentally discharged, severing the middle finger of a passerby's right hand. He immediately went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. It is said that the house is the private residence of the traitor Wang Jingwei, who, having been terrified by the failed assassination attempt in Hanoi, moved to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Tragic Car Accident in Hongkou, More Than Twenty Killed and Injured</p>
<p>A fish truck number 23528 belonging to the false fish market of Yangshupu was carrying more than twenty workers. At 6:20 AM on the 28th, after unloading fresh goods at the 16th Pier, it was returning when, while passing through the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Road, a public bus operated by the Japanese side drove eastward at high speed, causing a collision at the corner. The front of the public bus was slightly damaged, while the truck was severely damaged, with its body facing the sky. Three or four people on the truck were seriously injured and died immediately, and eighteen were injured. The Japanese side called ambulances to send them to Renji and Tongren Hospitals for treatment.</p>
<p>Firing Anti-Aircraft Guns in Hot Weather, Truly Inconceivable</p>
<p>On the 26th, anti-aircraft guns were fired on the Jiang. Many citizens were awakened by the noise. However, according to Western observers, there were no Chinese planes coming at the time. Later, the Japanese side explained that because "the weather was hot," the soldiers might not be able to stand it, so they were given some empty bombs and allowed to fire them.</p>
<p>Rumors of War in Wusong, Land and Water Transportation Severed</p>
<p>It is rumored that war broke out in Wusong on the evening of the 27th, and the situation was chaotic, with rampant rumors. Security in the area has been tightened. In addition to the ferry from the concession to Wusong being suspended and not yet restored, the ferry across the river from Gaoqiao to Wusong was also temporarily interrupted yesterday. Those who wanted to go there could only go by land through Zhabei, but the inspection was very strict.</p>
<h3>The Geography and Evolution of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wei Ran</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally just a coastal fishing village, anciently called Hu Du (滬凟), where "Hu" refers to fishing gear. The reason it was named Shanghai is stated in Volume 1, "Evolution," of the Shanghai County Records of the Ming Dynasty's Hongzhi era: "A place situated above the ocean, hence the name."</p>
<p>Over four thousand years ago, Shanghai was part of Yangzhou. During the Spring and Autumn period, it belonged to Wu, then Yue. During the Warring States period, it belonged to Chu. Legend has it that it was the fief of Lord Chunshen Huang Xie of Chu. The Huangpu River is named after Huang Xie because he is said to have ordered its dredging; hence, it was also called Chun Shen Jiang (春申江), or simply Jia Jiang (甲江). During the Qin Dynasty, Lou County was established, under the jurisdiction of Kuaiji Commandery. Shanghai was likely located in the southern territory of Lou. At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, it belonged to the Kingdom of Jing, then the Kingdom of Wu, and later the Kingdom of Jiangdu. During the reign of Emperor Wu, it reverted to Kuaiji Commandery under Yangzhou. During the Later Han Dynasty, it belonged to Wu Commandery under the Yangzhou Inspectorate. During the Jian'an era, it was Zhu Zhi's fief. During the Three Kingdoms period, Wu was the Marquisate of Lou. During the Jin Dynasty, it belonged to Wu Commandery under the Yangzhou province. The Song and Qi Dynasties followed suit. During the Tianjian era (Liang Dynasty), Lou County was abolished and Xinyi County was established. Shanghai was then part of the southern territory of Xinyi. At the beginning of the Datong era, Xinyi was split to re-establish Kunshan County, still under Wu Commandery. Shanghai became part of Kunshan County again. The Chen Dynasty followed suit. During the Sui Dynasty, it was merged into Changshu, then Kunshan County was re-established under Suzhou, which was subordinate to the Yangzhou Xingtai. In the tenth year of the Tianbao era (Tang Dynasty), the land of Kunshan, Haiyan, and Jiaxing counties was divided to establish Huating County under Suzhou, which was subordinate to Jiangdong Circuit. The northeast of Huating bordering the sea is the present-day Shanghai. During the Five Dynasties period, it belonged to the Kingdom of Wuyue, initially under Kaiyuan Prefecture, then under the Zhongwu Military Commission, and later under Xiuzhou. The Song Dynasty continued the system of the Five Dynasties, under the Liangzhe Circuit. At the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty's Qingyuan era, it belonged to Jiaxing Prefecture. Shanghai was still part of Huating County. Later, the population grew significantly, and merchant ships gathered, gradually forming a large market. The Office of Maritime Trade and the Office of Taxation were established, naming it Shanghai Town.</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Yuan Dynasty's Zhiyuan era, at the request of Prefect Pu San Hanwen, the townships of Changren, Gaochang, Beiting, Xinjiang, and Haiyu were separated from Huating County to establish Shanghai County, under Songjiang Prefecture, which was subordinate to the Jiangzhe Province. Its jurisdiction extended east to the sea, south to the border of Huating County, west to Kunshan Prefecture of Pingjiang Route, and north to Jiading Prefecture of Pingjiang Route. It was forty-eight li from north to south and one hundred li from east to west, encompassing five townships and twenty-six bao (units of local administration). This was the extent of Shanghai County when it was first established.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, Shanghai County belonged to Songjiang Prefecture, directly under Nanjing. During the Jiajing era, the townships of Xinjiang, Beiting, and Haiyu in the west of the county were separated to establish Qingpu County, which was soon abolished. During the Wanli era, it was re-established, and the remaining parts of Beiting and Xinjiang townships were added to it. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the county belonged to the prefecture as in the Ming Dynasty, under the Jiangnan Right Financial Commissioner's Office. At the beginning of the Kangxi era, it was placed under the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner's Office. During the Yongzheng era, the land of Changren Township in the southwest was separated to establish Nanhui County. During the Jiaqing era, fifteen tu (units of local administration) of coastal land in Gaochang Township were further ceded to the Chuansha Pacification Commissioner's Office. At that time, Shanghai only governed three bao of Changren Township and nine bao of Gaochang Township. The territory continued to shrink until the end of the Qing Dynasty, remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic of China, daos, prefectures, zhou, and ting were abolished, and Shanghai became directly under Jiangsu Province. In the third year of the Republic, the dao system was re-established, and it was subordinate to the Huhai Dao, with the same jurisdiction as in the late Qing Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Office of the Shanghai and Songhu Commercial Port Superintendent was established. The area under its jurisdiction, in addition to the entire Shanghai County, included the one city and five xiang (townships) of Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinhang, Pengpu, Zhenru, and Gaoqiao belonging to Baoshan. All administrative affairs were managed by the Office and were not within the administrative scope of the province.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the National Revolutionary Army established Shanghai as a special municipality directly under the central government. The area of the Shanghai Special Municipality, in addition to the original jurisdiction of the Shanghai and Songhu Commercial Port, also included the two xiang of Dachang and Yanghang belonging to Baoshan County, a portion of Qibao xiang belonging to Songjiang and Qingpu counties, a portion of Xinzhuang xiang belonging to Songjiang County, and a portion of Zhoupu belonging to Nanhui County. It crossed five counties, with thirty shi (cities) and xiang, covering an area of ​​2,692 square li, approximately seventy li from east to west and over a hundred li from north to south. Although the boundaries of the municipal area were demarcated, what was actually received in the seventeenth year of the Republic was only the eleven shi and xiang of Hunan and Zhabei belonging to Shanghai, and the six shi and xiang of Wusong and Gaoqiao belonging to Baoshan County, all of which were renamed qu (districts). In May of the nineteenth year of the Republic, the National Government promulgated the Organizational Law, changing all special municipalities to shi (municipalities) directly under the Executive Yuan. In July of the same year, it was renamed Shanghai Municipality, with the same jurisdiction as before.</p>
<p>The four boundaries of Shanghai Municipality are: to the east, Chuansha County and Nanhui County; to the south, Nanhui County; to the west, Jiading County, Qingpu County, and Songjiang County; to the north, Baoshan County, and also bordering the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The geographical coordinates of Shanghai on Earth are as follows:</p>
<p>According to the measurement by the Dredging Bureau, the longitude and latitude of the Jianghai Customs flagpole are:</p>
<p>East longitude 121 degrees 29 minutes 00.02 seconds;</p>
<p>North latitude 31 degrees 14 minutes 20.38 seconds.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's only major commercial port, and its harbor is formed by the Huangpu River waterway. According to the port area defined by the Dredging Bureau, the Jiangnan Arsenal is the upper end of the harbor, and Donggoukou is the lower end, with a total length of 54,000 feet, with five bends in between. The distance between the two banks varies from 1,080 feet to 2,000 feet. Except for the Zhoujiazuisha beach, even at the lowest tide line, there is a width of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. However, the average width of the waterway with a depth of 24 feet is only 750 feet. The port's capacity to accommodate ships is over 400,000 tons, meaning that approximately seventy ships ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 tons can be berthed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Ships coming from overseas or coastal areas must first pass through the mouth of the Yangtze River, and then enter the Huangpu River via Wusong. There are no rocks on the northeast sea surface outside the mouth. Thirty nautical miles offshore, there is a deep water depth of 60 feet. The southeast sea surface has many islands and sandbars, which pose a considerable obstacle to navigation, so one must follow the designated waterways marked by lighthouses and buoys between the islands.</p>
<p>Taking the Port of Shanghai as the center, waterway routes can be divided into three routes: first, coastal routes; second, inland river routes; third, ocean routes.</p>
<p>Coastal routes reach various ports along China's coast, divided into two routes: one is the Nanyang route, heading south from Shanghai through Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, ending in Guangzhou, or extending to Haiphong and Saigon in French Indochina; the other is the Beiyang route, heading north from Shanghai to Haizhou, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Tianjin, Yingkou, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and other places.</p>
<p>Inland river routes, also known as inland port routes, are mainly the Yangtze River route, followed by the Suzhou River route and the Huangpu River route. (1) The Yangtze River route travels from the port of Wusong upstream the Yangtze River, passing through various ports in the Yangtze River basin, reaching Chongqing. The section between Shanghai and Hankou is 592 miles long and is the most scenic. In winter, it can accommodate ships with a draft of 8 to 10 feet, and in summer, it can accommodate ships with a draft of 28 to 30 feet. (2) The Suzhou River route flows eastward into the Huangpu River. Traveling northwest along the river, it reaches Wuxian, a distance of approximately 300 Chinese li. It also connects to the interior of Jiangsu, such as Qingpu, Kunshan, Changshu, Hushu Pass, Wangting, Dangkou, and Wuxi. (3) The Huangpu River route travels south and west along the Huangpu River, connecting to southern Jiangsu and the hinterland of Zhejiang, reaching Hangzhou in approximately 500 Chinese li and Wuxing in approximately 600 Chinese li.</p>
<p>Ocean routes reach major commercial ports around the world, divided into the Sino-American route, the Nanyang-India route, the Australian route, the Japan route, the Siberian route, etc. China's ocean routes originate from the four ports of Dalian, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Hong Kong, with Shanghai being suitably located in the middle of the coastline.</p>
<p>The coastal route southward seemed to have started very early, while the northward route can be said to have started with the Yuan Dynasty's maritime transport. As for the ocean route, the Nanyang route was opened up during the Ming Dynasty's Yongle era when Zheng He was sent to the Western Seas (commonly known as the Three Treasure Eunuch's voyage to the Western Seas), and Chen Changtong from Shanghai was among those who went.</p>
<p>The importance of Shanghai's position today is due to the changing times, but its advantageous geographical location is also the foundation for its development. The Boundary Records of the Shanghai County Records state: "Shanghai is at the tail end of eight provinces, the center of seven coastal provinces, and the focus of Pacific航lines." This truly explains Shanghai's geographical advantages.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Shanghai's Transportation Costs Many Years Ago</h3>
<p>Rickshaws:</p>
<p>50 wen from the Bund to the Racecourse</p>
<p>Trams:</p>
<p>The first line was from the Bund to Rue Cardinal</p>
<p>Buses:</p>
<p>Just an 11-year-old little brother</p>
<p>In Shanghai many years ago, a city universally recognized as "cheap," everything was very inexpensive. Transportation costs were naturally in line with this, fundamentally incomparable to the current phenomenon of high prices for everything. Nowadays, every family includes these previously insignificant transportation costs in their budget. Even some companies are adding to salaries under the guise of "transportation allowances," demonstrating the importance of transportation costs in the 20th century.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people, due to the soaring daily transportation costs, have naturally moved to the central areas of the city. This is simply a secondary cause promoting urban prosperity!</p>
<p>Of course, the cost of rickshaws (referring to human-powered rickshaws) depended on the time and environment. If it was a quiet time, it was relatively cheaper. Generally speaking, according to several old Shanghainese, it only cost five copper coins to go from the current Waibaidu Bridge to Race Course Road via Nanjing Road!</p>
<p>However, rickshaws at that time did not have rubber tires, and the roads were covered with cobblestones. Under such poor material conditions, speed was naturally out of the question. The same journey that now takes only fifteen minutes took forty-five minutes back then. But, having paid the price of five copper coins, what high price would you hope for?</p>
<p>In March 1908, the first tram line appeared in the Public Concession. At that time, the eastern terminus was on the Bund, and the western terminus was at the corner of Rue Cardinal and Rue Nizan. The fare was four copper coins. Later, to make it more convenient for the general public after the abolition of small foreign silver dollars, it was changed to one cent and three li, which was actually still the same. The trams, excluding the sixty trams used by the Shanghai Electric Construction Company, of which twenty were used, were non-existent. A tenth of the current ones.</p>
<p>Later, the tram fare in the Public Concession was extended, passing through North Railway Station, Rue de la Gare, Quai de la Ligne, Wusong Road, Minhang Road, Seward Road, and reaching the Bund, then returning to the railway station via Guangzhou Road, Zhejiang Road, and North Zhejiang Road. This journey, which began operating in 1909, took about an hour and cost twelve copper coins. As for the later-established Yangshupu Bund line, it also incidentally made it its terminus, with the same fare of twelve copper coins. If you took third class, it would be three cents cheaper. In relative comparison, the current twenty-minute journey in the French Concession costs one dime and one cent, which shows how alarmingly the transportation costs have increased since the war last year!</p>
<p>In 1908, trams in the French Concession also began to operate slightly, with the eastern terminus at Nantou Market and extending westward to the corner of Avenue Dubail and Route des Soeurs.</p>
<p>But cars started running even earlier, around 1905-1906. At that time, gasoline only cost four dimes a gallon, only one-fifth of the current price! Car rentals were discovered not many years ago. At that time, the cost of a five-seater car was three yuan, and a seven-seater car was four yuan. The greatest use of these rental cars was when fathers would take their mothers and children out to get some fresh air after dinner. Because gasoline was cheap, rental car operators made a lot of money. However, on the other hand, the cost of some repairs was particularly high compared to today! By 1910, Shanghai also saw the same type of mobile rental cars as in foreign countries. These cars were mostly parked on the Bund, ready to meet people's needs at any time.</p>
<p>The emergence of buses was even more recent. In 1928, both Concessions began to operate them. Although there have been some changes in the type of cars and routes since then, these are relatively few.</p>
<p>At this time, the price of gasoline had increased to one yuan per gallon. Until a few years ago, a car merchant introduced Soviet gasoline (oil everywhere gasoline) to the market, and the price dropped to six dimes a gallon. However, this situation quickly changed, and now it generally costs one yuan and four dimes a gallon. This result has made the bus and tram businesses more prosperous, and more used cars are being sold!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the cost of living in Shanghai is indeed somewhat unsuitable for Chinese tastes, isn't it? A worker who earns a few dimes has to take a car because of the distance, and the daily transportation costs cost him several dimes. How is he supposed to live? Therefore, too many people in this city are trembling with worry about making a living.</p>
<p>But if you compare Shanghai with the world's major cities, Shanghai still deserves the reputation of being a "cheap city." But, after all, the environment is different!</p>
<h3>Shanghai is Sinking! The Yangshupu Area Sinks One Inch Every Three Years, While Other Areas Sink One Inch or More Annually.</h3>
<p>At a meeting of the Civil Engineering Society on May 22nd, Mr. Watterson, a famous writer and engineer, stated that between February 1934 and June 1937, the area along Yangshupu Road had sunk more than five inches. This is the most severe sinking in the entire Shanghai area. This record was obtained from the Public Works Department's benchmark at the corner of Yihang Road and Yangshupu Road. It is believed that the sinking of the large warehouses on the north bank of the road is the cause of the change in the benchmark in the area. Other areas of Shanghai have also experienced similar changes. The former Bund benchmark recorded a sinking of almost six inches between April 1919 and December 1933, with an average rate of 1.26 inches per year. During the same period, the benchmark outside the Bund Park recorded a sinking of only one-quarter of an inch per year on average. The sinking of various areas in Shanghai's densely built-up areas varies from slightly more than one-third of an inch to almost two inches per year. The classification and analysis are still based on the size of the adjacent loads, the nature of the subsoil (i.e., whether it is on the old riverbed), and the possible influence of nearby deep wells. The sinking on the old riverbed is ninety percent faster than that not on the riverbed. The speed of land subsidence is directly proportional to the size of the adjacent vehicle load and is also affected by the absorption of deep wells within a radius of 400 feet.</p>

<h3>New Film "King of Chinatown" Completed. Anna May Wong Delivers a Patriotic Speech. Eastern Daughter Discovers "Motherly" Love. In Hollywood, She Sells Clothes to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>At the celebration banquet for "King of Chinatown," in addition to the male and female leads of the film, Akim Tamiroff and Anna May Wong, as well as the director and other staff members, there were also a few reporters. The focus of the conversation was obviously concentrated on Anna May Wong, because Miss Wong was the only foreigner at this banquet, and her country was at war with another country.</p>
<p>To a reporter's question, "What are Miss Wong's thoughts on China's resistance against Japan?" Anna May Wong gave her high-minded opinion:</p>
<p>"From my point of view, this is not a 'question' because what you call 'China' is my motherland. A person's body may be in another country, but her heart always belongs to her motherland. I don't want to boast that I am a patriot, and I must admit that if I hadn't been to China that time, my feelings for my motherland would still be very sluggish and dull. But that time I went and realized how lovable my homeland and people were. So this time, the resistance against Japan feels to me like something happening in my own home. I should add that the last time I returned to China, it was entirely to see the true face of my motherland. In the embrace of my motherland, I discovered 'motherly love.' From that time on, I confirmed that I am a Chinese woman. Before that time, I was just an Eastern daughter growing up in Los Angeles. My feelings about China's invasion and resistance are the same as the feelings when one's own family is devastated and family members are fighting thugs armed with sticks and firearms. I am sad, I am indignant, but I also feel proud. And what I am most proud of is that my friends in Hollywood are completely sympathetic to my side—they have launched a no-stocking movement and are buying my clothes at several times their original value, so that I can send this money back to help refugees. These great actions and graces are forever worthy of admiration and gratitude! (Anlan)</p>
<h3>The Origin of Mickey Mouse's Name. It Was Originally the Sound of a Train Wheel. Disney Adopted it as the Title of a Cartoon</h3>
<p>Mickey Mouse's original name was Mickey Mouse. According to "Walt Disney" by French journalist Medeloine Leeve, the creation and naming of Mickey Mouse was very accidental.</p>
<p>At that time, Walt Disney, like ordinary, unknown cartoonists, was writing the long-running comic book "Alice in Wonderland" in New York, but he felt that he was different from others after all. So he left New York and went to Hollywood to try his luck.</p>
<p>The creation of Mickey Mouse was on the train from New York to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Walt Disney liked to raise mice. He liked their timid nature and timid actions. In his office, he kept a cage of mice. One of them had been tamed. Disney often let her out and let her run on the table. Her slender ears moved uneasily, her tail swayed from side to side, and a pair of red eyes stared at Disney. When he was tired from work, she was Disney's comforter.</p>
<p>This time, Disney also took her on the train. But Disney was pondering on the train. The audience was already tired of Alice and the White Rabbit. What new things could he offer to the audience?</p>
<p>The train sped towards Hollywood. He lay on the train's sleeping chair, holding a sketchbook in one hand and drawing paper in the other, thinking hard...</p>
<p>On the plains of the west, the train rolled forward, and the sound of the wheels was "Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse..."</p>
<p>Disney closed his eyes and thought hard for a long time, but still had no results. So he gradually began to pay attention to the song sung by the wheels: "Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he sat up, opened the mouse cage next to him, and released the little mouse he had tamed. He immediately picked up his pen and drew on the paper. With a few strokes, a silver screen hero was created. Disney wrote the two words "Mickey Mouse" next to it.</p>
<p>When it came to China, people translated it as "Mickey Mouse." (Chen Xiaobo)</p>

<h3>School Junior Volleyball Tournament: Pui Ying and Wah Yan Both Triumph, King's College and Southwest Put Up Strong Fight But Lose; Two More Junior Matches Today</h3>
<p>Pui Ying Defeats King's College</p>
<p>Yesterday, two junior matches of the school volleyball tournament were held. In the match between Pui Ying and King's College, after the initial contact, Pui Ying's defense and offense were consistent. King's College's defense appeared disorganized. In the first set, Pui Ying took the lead 21-19. King's College suffered an initial setback. Jiang Yingchao, Bao Jiafu, Liang Shide, Yu Runde, and others tried their best to counterattack. Pui Ying's Zhou Gengshen, Chen Fangyu, Huang Huahan, Huang Jiyao, and others worked together to defend. However, King's College's offense was strong, with frequent spikes. They returned the favor with a score of 21-18. After this, Pui Ying rallied and seized the opportunity to spike. King's College's line collapsed. Pui Ying won the third set 21-14. King's College hoped to recover lost ground. Huang Mao, Chen Lun, Liang Hua, and others tried their best to counterattack, but Pui Ying's team was in full swing, launching volleys of attacks. King's College fought until 5:17 PM, but Pui Ying won 21-17.</p>

Regarding this year's interport competition, because Lun Xian from Hong Kong will compete in Shanghai, it is planned to invite the Hong Kong team and the Tianjin team to Shanghai to hold a triangular interport competition.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of a Football Player</h3>
<p>A football team that officially takes the field has eleven players, each with different responsibilities, but all equally important. For example, some say that the responsibility of the defenders is greater than that of the forwards. If this were the case, the team could only defend and not attack. Conversely, if the forwards are good but the defenders are weak, they can only attack and not defend. If the opponent attacks, the result will inevitably be unfavorable. A team with balanced strength can often defeat a team with uneven development, because of the word "balanced." With balanced strength, the eleven players make fewer mistakes when fighting, and can fully demonstrate their skills! However, it is not easy for a person's skills to reach a high level. It requires a long period of practice and understanding to reach this level. Now, let's talk about the skills and responsibilities of each position.</p>
<p>(1) Goalkeeper - He can be considered the soul of the team. A skilled goalkeeper can greatly increase the team's courage. A goalkeeper must be tall, agile, and not sluggish, flustered, or impatient. He must be calm, composed, quick-witted, adaptable, and nimble. In any urgent situation, he must act according to the circumstances and not be bound by one style. When the attacking team shoots, he must observe the direction of the shot before the enemy moves his foot, and quickly prepare, standing upright in his position and posture to receive the ball. He must always pay attention to his position and not be too close to the white line under the goal. He must know that there is a kind of ball that forces you to retreat two steps to catch it. If you are too close to the white line under the goal, then those two steps have already crossed the white line. Even if you can catch the ball, it will be counted as a goal for the opponent. Therefore, experienced goalkeepers usually stand two or three feet or five or six feet away from the goal. But when the enemy raises his foot to shoot, he must retreat one or two steps, approaching the white line under the goal, to narrow the range of catching the ball. The goalkeeper should preferably catch the ball with his hands and kick it out, which is more stable. Kicking with the feet or hitting with the palms are not good strategies, but in certain situations, it is necessary to abandon the hands and resort to fists and feet. That is an exception. For example, if the enemy center sends a high ball from the center back line that falls in front of the goal, and the enemy's forward also rushes to the goal at the same time, if you go to catch the ball, you will inevitably be bumped into the net by the enemy, man and ball together. At this time, it is useful to punch the ball out. Also, if a low ball comes quickly towards the goal, and the enemy is rushing behind the ball ten yards away, although the ball is already out of his reach, it would be terrible if you bend over to catch it. You must know that in the instant you bend down, he has already rushed in front of you, because he wants to shoot the ball into the goal, so he raises his foot regardless of everything. Your face happens to be facing the ground, imagine how dangerous that would be. This kind of ball can only be kicked out with a quick foot. When the goalkeeper catches the ball in his hand, if an enemy blocks the goal, he must use the stealing and dodging method to avoid him. But he cannot carry the ball more than four steps, otherwise it will be a foul. This point should be paid special attention to. When catching the ball, you should follow the momentum of the ball to avoid the force of the rebound, so that there will be no situation where the ball falls again after being caught. After losing one or two goals, do not be frustrated or discouraged. You should be extra spirited to deal with it. After your team has scored one or two goals, you cannot be arrogant and let the ball fall over your head. If you are too hasty, do not reach out to catch it, it is safer to pat it into a corner kick.</p>
<p>(2) The duty of the defenders is more important than that of the forwards when the enemy launches a major attack. The forwards can miss a kick or make a mistake, but the defenders must not make a mistake, otherwise it will be losing a goal. Therefore, those who act as defenders bear a great responsibility that is related to life and death. Those who practice as defenders must have a strong body and strength, accurate eyesight, hard feet, clear head, and courageous spirit. In very urgent situations, they must use great calmness to act, and it is more appropriate to be cautious. The left and right defenders must have considerable understanding and cooperation. When the enemy's forward approaches the penalty area, they should go to steal the ball on the one hand, and fully protect the goalkeeper on the other, and must not entangle themselves unclearly and obstruct his sight. When the forward dribbles the ball forward, they must advance step by step, and must not be complacent, thinking that the ball has been dribbled out by the forward, and that my responsibility has been completed. That would be a fundamental mistake! When the enemy counterattacks and the ball crosses the kickoff line, the center back should go to steal the ball, and the defender must immediately prepare to kick the ball, which should be high rather than low, fast rather than slow. In any serious situation, there must be no deliberate fouls. It must be known that fouls by defenders are mostly sentenced to death (penalty kick). Once a penalty is imposed, it will not only lose a goal, but also cause dissatisfaction among the spectators with their own actions. Those who serve as defenders must not have a strong desire to win or lose, and must not be irresponsible. If they have a strong desire to win or lose, they will foul more often. If they are irresponsible, it is easy to lose the ball. Victory or defeat and responsibility are clearly two different things. May those who serve as defenders appreciate it themselves. The center back is the leader of an army. He can help the forwards attack and retreat to help the defenders defend. The responsibility is great. Only those who have a brave spirit, strong physique, and clear mind can take on this great task. He must have the full skills of heading, kicking, dribbling, and shooting.</p>

<h3>Twenty Tips for Gymnastics</h3>
<p>(11) Gymnastics must follow the order of moving from small movements to large movements. Therefore, it must start with gentle movements - limb movements, followed by important movements - torso movements in the middle, and end with rapid movements - jumping movements. The amount of movement should be gradually increased to the maximum.</p>
<p>(12) In recent times, those who practice gymnastics believe that during gymnastics, blood circulation speeds up, and breathing becomes rapid, so there is a natural breathing movement, and there is no need to set up a special breathing movement. However, others believe that after gymnastics, in order to make the body easier to return to its original state, ending with breathing exercises is also in line with the principles of physical education.</p>
<p>(13) The materials for gymnastics must be selected according to the individual's physical condition and the degree of gymnastics practice, from easy to difficult, from shallow to deep, step by step. Do not blindly aim high and far, overestimating your own strength, or reversing the order. Misuse of difficulty can result in little effect.</p>
<p>(14) The so-called difficulty and depth of gymnastics refers to the order between multiple sets of gymnastics, not the order between the sections of a set of gymnastics. Therefore, the degree of difficulty and depth between each section of a set of gymnastics must be equal. Do not be difficult at times and easy at others, or deep at times and shallow at others. Otherwise, not only will the practitioner feel that some sections are too easy and others are too difficult, but also the sudden increase or decrease in the amount of exercise will violate the principles of physical education.</p>
<p>(15) Gymnastics materials do not need to be changed frequently, but practicing one action for too long often leads to boredom. However, the muscles used for the same part of the body often vary depending on the action. If the same action is used all the time, it may not be in line with the purpose of balanced development of the whole body. Therefore, it is still better to have the opportunity to change a set of gymnastics after practicing for a considerable period.</p>
<p>(16) When practicing gymnastics, you must understand the function of each section of gymnastics. Then, even when there is no instructor, you can freely select materials and change them at will. If you just follow blindly, knowing only the "what" but not the "why," then you will not be sure when selecting materials, and you will spread errors, misunderstand each other, and it will be difficult to obtain good results.</p>
<p>(17) When practicing gymnastics, you must understand the depth and difficulty of various actions. Then, you can select materials that are suitable for entering the deeper parts of the body and following the principle of entering from the easy to the difficult, as well as meeting your own physical needs. To distinguish the depth and difficulty of actions, you only need to look at the length of the path of the moving part and the size of the arc. The longer the path of the moving part and the larger the arc that the action passes through, the greater the amount of exercise and the deeper and more difficult the action will be. If you can carefully distinguish the actions, it will not be difficult to understand.</p>
<p>(18) The time spent on a set of gymnastics is at most only a few tens of minutes. No matter how large the amount of continuous movement is, there is no reason why it cannot be supported. Therefore, adding rest time between each section is unnecessary, and the rest time is more than the practice time. Also, limiting the number of actions in each section with a fixed number such as four or eight, regardless of the level of physical strength or the amount of exercise, is also an unnecessary arrangement.</p>
<p>(19) The best time for gymnastics is twice a day, each time from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night. Performing gymnastics in the morning can promote blood circulation and prepare you for a full day of energy. Performing gymnastics before going to bed can draw blood from the brain to the limbs and eliminate the pain of insomnia.</p>
<p>(20) Gymnastics is best performed outdoors in an open space, so that you can naturally absorb fresh air. However, if there is no suitable outdoor environment, it is also acceptable to perform it indoors. However, you must pay attention to opening the doors and windows so that outdoor air can flow in.</p>

<h3>The State and Economic Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Zhang Dechang</p>
<p>Controlled economy and planned economy, from one perspective, have something in common, that is, using political power to dominate and manage the development of economic undertakings. Although using political power to interfere in economic undertakings is popular today, tracing its evolution reveals a historical background of hundreds of years. We can divide this evolution into three stages.</p>
<p>As early as the seventeenth century, European countries such as England, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden, under the ideological domination of mercantilism, all had an ideal of a wealthy and powerful country. In order to achieve this goal, various countries implemented various policies to seek the development of their own industries, commerce, navigation, and agriculture. Among them, the French government was the most enthusiastic. In the era of Louis XIV, there were various decrees to encourage emerging industries and punish industrialists and businessmen who did not comply with the decrees. England was also like this. However, their policies, on the whole, did not achieve the grand results they expected. Of course, there were also successes, such as the development of England's maritime navigation industry, which undoubtedly benefited from the implementation of the Navigation Acts. But from the whole, we can say that the political intervention in economic undertakings at that time was a failure. The main reason for the failure was that the government organizations at that time were not perfect, and they themselves could not shoulder the task of developing the economy. Therefore, the government of the era of Louis XIV of France was the most enthusiastic government in developing industry and commerce, but it was also a failed government. A government whose own organization is not sound, even if it has good intentions, often, in order to develop industry and commerce, ends up destroying industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The precedent of political intervention in economic undertakings in the era of mercantilism is an example of the relationship between the state and economic undertakings that we can find in history, but it is a failed example, and it did not have a direct impact on the modern ideas of controlled economy and planned economy.</p>
<p>The political intervention in economic undertakings in the era of mercantilism failed, so it caused a reaction. This reaction was to explain that the state should not interfere in economic undertakings. This statement not only has historical facts to prove it, but also has a set of academic theories, which is very powerful and popular for a generation. But in the nineteenth century, the facts gave us a major counter-evidence. The state should intervene, and the result of intervention is conducive to the development of economic undertakings. The evidence of the nineteenth century tells us that the state should provide assistance and management to the development of economic undertakings. Not only should it be adjusted in production, but also the scope of state management should be extended to all aspects. The example of the state using political power to dominate and manage the entire economic undertaking is a feature of the late nineteenth century. In agriculture, Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century faced a major threat, namely the invasion of American agricultural products.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented in Decades (Continued): The Japanese Yen Plummets to a Record Low; Japanese Banking Circles Do Not Seem to Support It</h3>
<p>Currency in Circulation Not Recovered</p>
<p>When the so-called military tickets that were not in circulation were used, the Japanese army in Central China circulated the Japanese yen to purchase goods and for other transactions. It seemed that the circulation had stopped last autumn, but the Japanese yen banknotes that had already been in circulation at that time were not recovered. As a result, they appeared in the Central China market. It is estimated that the Japanese yen circulating in Central China totaled between 30 million and 50 million yuan. The Japanese side refused to recover the depreciated Japanese yen circulating in Central China by exchanging currency or goods, which resulted in the further depreciation of the Japanese yen. This depreciation, of course, has an adverse reaction to the Japanese yen at home, but the Bank of Japan is unlikely to take action to support the value of Japanese yen banknotes in Shanghai. If they add support, they can only reduce the possibility of recovering the Japanese yen in the showcase. But this is precisely what Japan does not want to do. The way Japan treats the Japanese yen circulating in Shanghai has some similarities with the way the German government treats the marks circulating abroad. Germany does not actually support the circulation of its banknotes overseas, and minimizes the possibility of recovery. As a result, the ratio of German banknotes overseas is only half the face value of the mark. Japan may follow Germany's footsteps.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Claims That There is Too Much Circulation in Shanghai</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 23rd that someone questioned the depreciation of the Japanese yen at a Japanese press briefing yesterday. According to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, this is a phenomenon of economic supply and demand imbalance and is not worth mentioning. According to the spokesman, recently more and more Japanese yen have arrived in Shanghai. Each time a ship comes from Japan, more than a thousand travelers arrive, each carrying a considerable amount of Japanese currency to supply the market. However, the Shanghai market cannot absorb so many Japanese yen at once, so there is an impact on the exchange rate. It is doubtful that this explanation has many points. Tomorrow's newspaper (the French newspaper claims) will examine it. Also, the North China Daily News reported that when reporters were received yesterday (the 22nd), someone asked about the sudden drop in the Japanese yen exchange rate. The speaker replied that this matter had various factors, the main one being the problem of supply and demand, and claimed that a large number of Japanese people came to Shanghai, about a thousand on each ship, which naturally caused the Japanese yen to fall. When asked whether the Japanese people who came to Shanghai were all related to the Japanese army, the spokesman replied that most of them were tourists. (End)</p>

<h3>Difficult to Write About Xianghu</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>One: Xiangxi's Important Town… Yuanling</p>
<p>Today, with the enemy having occupied Yueyang and posing a threat to the northern bank of Dongting Lake, Xiangxi holds a significant position in terms of national defense. The terrain of Xiangxi is so treacherous, and the character of the people is so strong; these are all excellent conditions for our war of resistance needs. However, the low level of culture and the lack of widespread awareness of the war of resistance are serious problems that urgently need to be resolved.</p>
<p>It was during the evacuation from Wuhan and the fear of Changsha that I traveled along the highway from Changsha, passing through Yiyang, Changde, Taoyuan, Guanzhuang, and arriving at Yuanling. I stayed in the Yuanling area for two months. Xiangxi left a deep impression on my mind and filled me with infinite emotion.</p>
<p>When I arrived, Yuanling had already transformed from a desolate and backward county town into a suddenly prosperous small city—the political, military, and commercial center, the important town of Xiangxi.</p>
<p>Yuanling's terrain is long and narrow, located at the foot of mountains. Looking down, one sees the clear Yuan River. The main street is only one, stretching east and west for no more than three or four li. Thatched houses and wooden shacks stand like tumors on the mountainside. The land is barren and infertile, with a lack of agricultural products. Usually, there are only corn, sweet potatoes, and edible jelly. It is said that the population used to be only over 10,000, but since the evacuation from Changsha and the relocation of the provincial government, the population has increased to over 100,000. Yuanling, which was not able to be self-sufficient in daily necessities and food, now presents a scene of hunger and chaos. Inns and residences are filled with government officials and high-class refugees. Shops and mountain-top thatched houses have been occupied or borrowed by the military and various teams. This intestine-like city is so crowded that it is about to explode. The main street is filled with people from dawn to dusk, everyone shoulder to shoulder, nose to nose. If a certain army enters the city, the entire population immediately feels the increased density of the surrounding air. Although the authorities have used many methods to maintain a peaceful state, the continuous influx of outsiders, difficult transportation, insufficient supply of goods, and low cultural level have led merchants to hoard goods and profiteer. As a result, prices are soaring day by day, the population cannot be evacuated, and the market order remains chaotic. People cannot settle down to work, which is a loss for both individuals and the nation!</p>
<p>From Yiyang to Changde, there are no steep mountains, but after Guanzhuang, there are endless mountains. The highway, like a large reptile, arduously climbs over many hills and passes through many barren and severe mountain ranges. After Yuanling, it branches off around Shili Pu, heading northwest past Qian City and Yongshun into Sichuan, and southwest via Zhijiang and Huangxian into Guizhou. In the past, Changde and Taoyuan were prosperous and affluent places, but since Dongting Lake was threatened by the enemy, Changde and Taoyuan have suffered numerous bombings, and prosperity has concentrated in Yuanling. West of Yuanling, such as Qian City and Yongshun, are even more impoverished, and a portion of the people have become bandits due to poverty and inability to make a living.</p>
<p>Speaking of the terrain, west of Guanzhuang, there are high and steep mountains. The mountains on both sides of the highway are simply natural, immovable guards. Not to mention that the enemy cannot deploy mechanized units here, even an ordinary walking traveler feels a bit scared by the barrenness. Looking up close, there are towering giant rocks; looking into the distance, there are lush green forests. Where exactly would the enemy fire their artillery? For dozens of miles, there are only a few scattered thatched houses. Would tank units dare to advance into the desert-like wilderness? Can their reinforcements and supplies be guaranteed not to be cut off? These are all our decisive advantages. If we add appropriate military deployments and widely mobilize guerrilla warfare, then even if the invaders send five divisions to attack Yuanling, the important town of Xiangxi, it would be in vain and would only result in complete destruction.</p>
<p>Xiangxi is barren and often faces famine, so the people mostly live a simple life. Whether in winter or summer, they mostly wear blue cloth shirts and pants. People with a more comfortable life wear a complete set of clothes. If they are from the middle or lower classes, then their clothes are patched and faded. Because Hunan is rich in rice production, people are accustomed to eating three to four meals a day. The main dish for each meal is chili and fermented soybeans, with at most a little vegetable and beans. However, they have developed a strong physique, able to withstand the sun and rain, and climb mountains and cross ridges as quickly as we walk on flat ground. Because of the tempering of the environment and life, they have long developed a strong character and a spirit of adventure. If this power can be properly used and developed, and guided into the scope of the war of resistance, wouldn't it become a great force?</p>
<p>I believe that if the government can systematically develop the various advantages of Xiangxi, then the Guanzhuang and Yuanling area will be an iron-like solid defense line, and the people of Xiangxi will surely become thousands of brave guerrilla teams.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Sailing</h3>
<p>— Xue Ming</p>
<p>On the riverbank, on the golden river water, ripples strings of sails. The evening mist, in this subtropical region, is always like a layer of gauze, covering the fields, and the sailing boats floating on the river slowly disappear into the humid mist. Stars are embedded in the boundless sky, seemingly peering at me. When I dragged my reluctant footsteps back home, the sailing shadows left me with an extremely fond emotion.</p>
<p>In my innocent childhood, immersed in myths and fantasies, sailing gave me countless illusory expectations. The slender, pointed shape slowly glided on the tranquil, stagnant, golden-colored Han River, gradually disappearing into the distant mountain shadows. Throughout the year, the coming and going of sailing boats, and the lives of the boatmen as calm and joyful as the river water in the sunshine and rain, disappeared and reappeared in the river along with rice, grain, local products, and porcelain.</p>
<p>However, since last year, the enemy cavalry invaded Jiangnan, and enemy planes roared over the riverbank, bombs raised flying flowers from the riverbank soil, and the turbid, yellow Han River water was stained with red blood.</p>
<p>Then, the flames of war forced me to bid farewell to my old home by the river.</p>
<p>Having lost a profoundly exciting emotion, the steamship carried me floating on the surging sea waves. The black water supported the arched sky, and the sea waves were more dangerous and fierce than the river tides. Waves constantly slapped against the ship's hull. In the deep blue ocean, in the silvery-white waves, I could never see the slowly gliding sailing boats again, and I never dared to look back, because behind me was a verdant homeland and the sailing boats that left me with fond emotions.</p>
<p>Seagulls and snow-white waves became the companions of the suffering people's journey. The vast sea and sky gave people infinite memories. A general, indescribable emotion surged into my heart, and I exclaimed: "No matter how enemy planes soar over our homeland, who can forget the storms of this great era? The motherland is facing the wind and waves, and we should also muster the courage to ride the waves."</p>
<p>Now, having been separated from my hometown for a whole year, I have not seen the returning sails slowly gliding on the calm river water in the twilight. In the Han River basin, there may only be enemy planes circling, and on the calm river water, there may only be鲜红的血流.</p>
<p>Holding the news sent by a soldier, looking at the starry sky through tearful eyes, the motherland is facing a storm, and we are also suffering in the storm, so tears gradually turned into tearful rain.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Chikan</h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>Having traversed over thirty li of muddy road and arriving at Baisha, it was already dusk. This made me very difficult: Should I stay overnight here or rush to Chikan? If I stay overnight, a great opportunity to go to the Jianghui front line would be missed. If I don’t, I won't have the time to inspect the situation here after the major bombing. Then, wouldn't it be a waste of a hard half-day journey?</p>
<p>After struggling for a long time, a local friend finally helped me solve this problem. He first guided me to hang around every desolate bomb crater, and then he called a bicycle for me. He comforted me:</p>
<p>"Lin, take this bicycle, you can still reach Chikan by night."</p>
<p>Looking at my bag, the hour and minute hands were kissing around the position of six. I hurriedly sat on the wooden board at the back of the bicycle, hastily said "goodbye," and the bicycle nimbly went through the road towards the countryside.</p>
<p>The bicycle rider was a strong and healthy youth. From a few special sounds in his speech, I distinguished that he was a local. His surname was Huang. He used to be a partner in a Suzhou-Hangzhou store, and now he earns a living by riding a bicycle for others with his two legs.</p>
<p>In the vast twilight, the bicycle passed over the flat highway. The wheels pressed against the fine sand, constantly emitting a rhythmic, low-pitched chant. The evening breeze gently brushed from the front field, and my two eyes constantly photographed every strange and beautiful scenery. At that time, the distress in my heart was replaced by joy; even the empty stomach was forgotten.</p>
<p>This inch by inch is "Shachi Highway." The road is so flat and complete, why don't cars run on it? I couldn't suppress the suspicion in my heart, so I asked the young man who was riding the bicycle about this question.</p>
<p>He stared intently at the front without looking back or squinting: he said:</p>
<p>"For many years, the traffic here has never stopped. Since the highway was implemented for destruction, although it was not damaged here due to the hinterland, the Chikan section more than ten li away has been destroyed. The route is too short, and the car company lost money, so it no longer operated the car. Later, due to various inconveniences, some people restored the car. But I know that on March 30, when the enemy plane carried out a massacre in Baisha, two cars were also damaged, and no cars have driven since!"</p>
<p>"Now, how do most people here travel?" As the car made a small turn, I asked this.</p>
<p>"Not to say that most of them walk, take a bicycle when rushing, and the rich can take a sedan chair." He still held the handlebars tightly, his eyes looking into the distance, as if he was not talking to me.</p>
<p>"Do women also take bicycles?"</p>
<p>"Yes, most of the ones who ride are the waitresses in the teahouses!" He said, grinning his teeth and smiling, this smile seemed to hide many mysteries.</p>
<p>I also thought of the various closed situations of the country folks, especially the rural women. When they occasionally saw a woman riding a bicycle in the two places, they all regarded it as a miracle. But now, they also come to sit on the back of a bicycle of an unfamiliar man. The changes brought by the war of resistance to the countryside are also very extraordinary!...</p>
<p>The road passed through layers of mountains, and the car glided over the sandy road in sections. When walking to a group of mountains, the young man who was riding the bicycle said to me:</p>
<p>"This is Baizu Mountain, there is Wen Tianxiang's tomb there."</p>
<p>I aroused a string of nostalgic feelings, and felt that Wen Tianxiang's steadfast spirit of sacrifice should be promoted in the war of resistance period, but why are there still so many traitors?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the car stopped in front of a pile of high floating mud. I paid the fare of six jiao and ten fen, and when I said goodbye to the strong and healthy youth, he amiably told me:</p>
<p>"This is Butterfly Ridge, and it is still five li from here to Chikan."</p>
<p>The highway was completely absorbed, and it was not good to walk or could not walk in the hazy dusk, so I had to find a small stone path to walk.</p>
<p>Looking back, the shadow of the strong and healthy youth who sent me along with the bicycle had disappeared. Turning my head again and looking up at the sky, the night was getting darker, maybe it would rain tonight? Just as I was predicting this, I suddenly remembered that I had dropped a "Timely" umbrella in Baisha, ah, what? ——Bad luck——</p>
<p>I hesitated annoyedly for a while, and finally moved forward again in one breath, passing through the deep twilight, and approaching the place that revealed a vague light step by step.</p>
<p>"What's so important? After all, I have arrived in Chikan tonight, and tomorrow I can rush to the front line of Jianghui." I comforted myself like this.</p>
<p>May, 1939, written in Chikan</p>
<h3>Before and After Going to the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>—A fragment of the conscript life</p>
<p>A faint light reflects on the paper screen, and the arrangement of the room roughly shows the outline. Opening the blanket, rubbing the blurred eyes, I quickly climbed out of bed.</p>
<p>Pushing open the window and looking out, the dimness of the remnant night has disappeared into the clear gray dawn. Comrade Li joyfully stretched his head and spoke in Hubei dialect:</p>
<p>"The weather must be good today, the publicity in the countryside must be smooth! Prepare quickly"!</p>
<p>Ignoring the commotion, I busily carried my military blanket and baggage. A group of people, red-faced and high-spirited, walked out of the bedroom and ran into the playground.</p>
<p>The high sky has been replaced with a silver-gray coat, and the morning stars have also faded the last of their light. The sky wind brings a burst of coolness, drilling into our thin uniforms: The night dew on the grass moistens the canvas running shoes, and the bugles and whistles keep ringing, like a fire, intensely burning in the hearts of everyone.</p>
<p>The neat line, in the instructor's strong and solemn tone, was divided into four propaganda teams, sixteen detachments. After dividing the routes and areas, he reiterated the propaganda outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization, and finally encouraged us, saying: "Mobilizing in the countryside is to increase the strength of the war of resistance in the villages. I hope you will achieve the expected goal; so that every farmer or shepherd can understand the effectiveness of the National Covenant, and their own obligations to give the invaders a serious blow... . "</p>
<p>His words ended when the second launch horn began.</p>
<p>Start: Walking on the narrow path, turning into the winding alleys, on the street, the street lights flickered with afterglow, drowsy shops, lowering the door panels... Through the city gate hole, through the electric grid, we rushed to the suburbs.</p>
<p>On the road, the sun had climbed to the horizon, the blood-red soft new rays of the strong first obliquely shone over, like a golden light gauze, dragging down to the edge of the earth, lining the colorful clouds around the morning, decorating half the sky with magnificent splendor, reflecting the horizontal fields and vegetable gardens, the clear morning breath, wandering in between .</p>
<p>Around, the smoke on the roofs of the houses, floating in the air thread by thread.</p>
<p>We looked at the thatched houses, looked at the light smoke, and the lively hearts became more unrestrained and vigorous. Passing through a village, we left a detachment, carrying a small flag, and began to preach to the farmers—National Spiritual Mobilization: Air defense knowledge in war-torn rural areas, and basic guerrilla skills.</p>
<p>Each of them gathered their spirits to listen to us slowly, and more and more people gathered: old uncles and old women opened their eyes, and the children danced, and nodded their little heads.</p>
<p>When we finished speaking, a group of villagers waved their hands and issued a giant roar like a shout:</p>
<p>"We want to cooperate with the National Army, we want to pick up iron hoes and rakes, aim at them, chop them! We want freedom, we want to live, we want to eat, get up and do it quickly!"</p>
<p>This is giving us the propaganda team to return to the village. The sound shook the villages, shook the fields, and also shook the distant valleys.</p>
