<h3 id="c1">關於上海資金疏散問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吳澤金</p>
<p>上海物價的步步高漲，已成為目前此間最嚴重的現象，本刊前曾堅請各位學者專家　詳細討論，研究其原因，及其穩定辦法，各位先生發表宏論高見的很多，不過，其中似乎並不有具體而實際的建議和辦法。</p>
<p>依據筆者的意見，上海物價的高漲，原因固然是多方面的，如因主產減少，供給減少，人口集中，外匯黑市場的成立等等，不過除掉這幾種原因外，上海通貨流通量的相當膨脹，無疑也是物價高漲主要原因之一，前次座談會裏，有幾位先生，特別是　光地先生這樣說過，『戰後上海流通籌碼不獨不及戰前的多，而且似乎較為緊縮一，這或許是指八一三戰事剛爆發後的情形，不過自國軍西徹後，各地的富有者，都集中到上海，隨着人他們來的，是大批資金，戰獲各銀行存欵急劇增加，及現時市面上充滿景氣投機的氣氛，都是確切的明證，因為資金的麕集一隅，便造成了現時的特殊繁榮，也就是造成了現時物價高漲的局面，所以平隱物價，除對上述的其他原因，研究方案對付外，對於如何使　集於上海的剩餘資金，適當地疏散，似乎是更應努力的。至於疏散的方法，筆者見到的有二點：</p>
<p>一，由政府發行一種為調劑上海金融而設短期金融庫券，授權於中中交農四行准行，四　當就上海實際需要的流通籌碼外，儘量利用此項庫券吸收一般游資，這種辦法，並不是新創，在一九三四的英國，也曾運用這種辦法來解决他當時的金融過剩的恐慌，不過在現時的上海，這種辦法是有困難的，第一因為上海是個淪陷區，雖然　裏有租界，不過政府債券，環境還是否允許公開推行，第二是巨額債券的推行，容易引起人民的誤解而對法幣懷疑。</p>
<p>二，由各銀行組織一大規模銀團，鼓勵並吸收一般富有者的資金，作有計劃的內移，此項資金由各銀行給以相當年限相當利率的担保，同時政府再向銀行保證利益，這種辦法，可以引起一般資產者對內地投資的興趣，因為過去他們的資金，所以寧願滯留上海而不敢內移，主因在於對內地的隔。和無把握，現在旣有各銀行担保利益，他們一定會樂於相助的。同時銀行則由政府保證，他是有益無損的。</p>
<p>此外如中中交農提高同業存欵利率，吸收同業休資，各銀行提高定期存欵利率，減少流動性質之活期存欵，並拒絕以欵項貸與一般投機和操縱居奇的商人等等，也都是相當可以減少游資穩定物價的辦法。</p>
<p>以上幾點，不過是筆者的一得之見，不能算是建議，希望注意上海資金問題者，再來一次詳細的討論研究，這裏不過聊供一個參考。</p>
<h3 id="c2">世界動向一週間　從廿八年六月廿五日至七月一日 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 公昭</p>
<p>中華民族偉太抗戰，快要整整的兩年了。日×為圖解救其侵華軍事所引起的整個崩潰的危機，正在從在華佔領區，從我國內都，從國際上，尋覓解救的辦法。於是，就有最近沿海和西北戰事的吃緊，就有汪逆及其應聲虫一羣的活動，就有英日衝突和英日談判。所有這一切，都是我們所不能忽視的。</p>
<p>老大英帝國和我國一樣的遭受侵略者的威脅，形勢更較我國嚴重，而應付侵略的政策及其執行，則沒有我們那樣堅定與迅速，因此對蘇互助談判，迄未獲得結果，而對日對德，又處處自陷於不利地位，在東方則天津事件日趨嚴重，整個遠東勢力有被驅逐的危險，在西方則但澤形勢極度吃緊，對波保證到了被迫兌現的時候了。</p>
<p>現在把最近一週國際形勢，試作一簡括的報吿：</p>
<p>（一）鳥瞰全局大可樂觀　獸軍陰謀急須警備</p>
<p>中華民挨兩年來的抗戰，雖然重要城鎮，相繼不守，全國各地，同胞受苦，但是日×『不戰而屈』『速戰速决』『速和速結』等企圖完全粉碎，而且傷亡將士百萬以上，消耗軍費數百萬萬，侵華泥足入水益深，我們則腐惡成份日漸淘汰，新生力量日漸滋長，長期奴役的枷鎖已斷，最後勝利的曙光已露；我們烏瞰抗戰全局，感到無限興奮。</p>
<p>目前日×，在軍事上已遇重大困難，不得不置侵華重心於政治，而以軍事為輔，因此，×人今後侵華軍略，是實行『以戰養戰』，着力於鞏固佔領地區，利用我國人力物力財力，養軍備戰，伺機征服我全國。日來侵華戰事，表面上雖各綫均轉激烈，尤以浙閩粵三省沿海形勢，逐日加緊，日×六月廿三日在汕頭豋陸，廿七日攻陷潮安，而浙東沿海的定海島，亦於廿三日失陷，連日×軍還積極佈置攻福州温州；玉環坎鬥，且已於廿八日被逼放棄。但是日×此種徵威的發揮，除了主要的在破壞英國在華中華南商務實行對英嚇詐以外，軍事上意義還祗是鞏固其在華東佔領區而已。</p>
<p>同時，我們各路前綫及×人後方，都有相當進展，第一是山西中條山的英雄們，已於六月下旬，打破了×人的七次進攻，廿五日克垣曲廿六日克阜落，南犯之×二萬餘人，數日內被殲二千以上。其次是粵北我軍運日反攻奏捷，廿八日還有一部衝入廣州市近郊的龍眼洞燕塘沙河一帶。此外東綫的宜興，以及魯南各地激戰，都有相當收獲。</p>
<p>不過目前日×一面鞏固佔領區，以戰養戰，一面採取對晉陝主攻的恣態，，實際上配合政治上的陰謀，藉以破壞我主動的全面的持久戰，因此我們不能私幸西南一隅的一時安全，而且急須主動的全面的發動，去打破×人以戰養戰的陰謀。</p>
<p>（二）汪逆賣國奔走南北　偽新政府名稱决定</p>
<p>我們已經知道，日×侵華，已陷入極大因難與危機之中，而日×本身力量，已不能解救這種困難與危機，因此急謀加强佔領地區的統治，以便加緊利用我國人力物力豺力，解救其困難與危機，養大其戰鬥力，分化我抗戰力，來征服我全國。</p>
<p>汪精衛的叛變，及其『反蔣反共反對抗戰』的主張與活動，便成為日×最較適當的工具。</p>
<p>這一週，汪逆夫婦，奔走南北，為日×籌備於七七盧溝橋事變兩週年之際，建立一個偽新政府，藉以統一及强化日×對於佔領區的統治，據路透社電，這個偽新政府，將定名為「全民政府」，統治範圍包括隴海綫以南華南所有佔領區，潜以靑犬白日國族下角加上五色旗，作為偽國旗，北平偽臨時政府則仍在半自立原則上繼續維持，並將宣佈凡屬反對將委長的國民黨員，准其在「全民』境內活動，而日本軍部則將為該偽新政府訓練軍隊。</p>
<p>汪精衛是這樣名實相符的充當日×的魔犬了。叛徒之做漢奸，不足驚奇，偽新政府之因日×漢奸內部訌爭，與我在×後戰鬥發展，而未必能夠安全生存，也將不出意料目前我們認為嚴重的：第一，日×汪逆等，有可能進而擺出政治的騙局，如對佔領區的『懷柔』與『廣州撤兵』等等，第二是一般視私人一時權利高出國家民族利益的此固份子，正在言論與事實上表現其同意於汪逆主張的某一部份，這正中了日×汪逆對我分化的育計。還是要大家加倍警惕與提高自信心的！</p>
<p>（三）英日准備東京談判　我國喚起列强警惕</p>
<p>日×為解救目前困難與危機除配合着上述軍事與政治的陰謀，有又對英嚇詐一策。這一第略之目的是，（一）破壞及强奪英國在華一切櫬益與財產，以便獨霸的『開發』其佔領區，（二）誘使英國與日妥協，共同壓迫我國對日降服。這一策略之進行步　是。（二）封鎖天津英租界，强佔汕頭潮安定海，截翁福州温州對外通商，用這些來威脅英圖（一）加緊對蘇聯對外蒙挑氛，一週來蘇蒙　滿邊境，形勢極為嚴重，這是對英國的誘惑，同時又可促使其西方之　友　意兩國安心並立卽採取從西方進盟英國的行動，（三）在上述步驟業已進行了之後，新就同意舉行東京談判，並且企圖擴大範圍，卽談判的不限於天津事件，而淪及整個英日國交的基本間題。亦卽企圖　東京為慕尼黑。誘使英政府與日合作屈服我國，再進而驅逐英國遠東全部勢力。</p>
<p>我國王龐惠外長。當卽於廿八日對歐廣播，指出日×侵略永無止境，企圖妥協是與虎謀皮，不僅不能解决遠東危局，且足引起更進一步的要求。我駐英顧維鈞大使亦曾先於廿八日發表演說，痛斥日×侵略，不獨破壞中國領土主權，且中國被吞，則外國在遠東權益亦決難倖免，這種警吿，對於國際，當然是有相當影響的。倫敦政界已有『關於遠東問題，英國决不擬變更旣定政策』的表示。不過我們要認淸：我們要爭取外援，但不是依賴，要依頓的是自力更生，是全體人民的動員，只有依靠民衆，堅持團結與抗戰，破壤×好一切陰謀，才能不為外力的變化而動搖，像泅水的不為水淹的一樣。</p>
<p>（四）德對但澤繼謀鯨吞　英國外相首作獅吼</p>
<p>前面已經說過，日×威脅英國，是具有國際意義的，果然，恰如銅鼓西崩，洛鐘東應，日×之西方盟友德國，又在歐洲發動起來了！但澤危岌！但澤危岌！這些大宇又在世界報紙上出現了。</p>
<p>但澤自由市，是波蘭三千五百萬人的生命綫，不僅在經濟十為波蘭唯一吐納港，而且在軍事上在政治上都是有决定波蘭命運的大環節，但同時，在德國看來，但澤是進攻東北歐的走廊。因此首先佔奪這條走廊，早已定在希特勒第二步進攻的計劃之中了。</p>
<p>不過，波蘭旣一再堅决地表示决不放任但澤被德併呑，而英國又在最近鄭重宣佈了保證波蘭安全，因此，德國目前的舉動，將是英國外交最後一次的試驗了！</p>
<p>現在，德國進謀但澤益急，並繼有德軍四千於廿八晚潛入但澤，波蘭方面為情勢嚴重，已積極准備陸海兩方均己實行新的佈置，英國呢？英國外相哈立法克斯，於廿九日發表『第一次强硬的』的演說，他說；『如再有侵略事件發生，吾人决以全力，履行吾人抵抗之誓言！』這雖是前所未聞的明確的宣言！但是，英國方面有識見的政治家艾登，邱吉爾等，早曾懷疑到英國履行諾言反抗侵略的誠意了，他們都說過『英法如未得蘇聯助力，殊難實踐保證波蘭之諾言』，而英國對蘇談判的誠意又在那裏呢？</p>
<p>（五）和平陣線頗有開展　中蘇中法友誼增進</p>
<p>說到英蘇談判，一波三折，幾乎使人頭痛，蘇聯議員希丹諾夫說得不錯：『這事足以證明英法對於蘇聯，不欲以平等之原則，互訂協約，英法實欲與蘇聯訂立一種條約，由蘇聯單方做一切工作，負一切責任；但此種條約，月能自尊的國家，倘不欲自成為玩具時，實不能訂立，蘇聯的武力興尊嚴，素為全世界所認識，怎肯簽訂這種協約？』</p>
<p>但是國際形勢却不能再許民主和平各國繼續做夢了！因此，維護和平反對侵略　運動，這一週來，又有相當的開展了！主要的是：</p>
<p>（一）中蘇兩國於六月十六日簽訂通商條約，這一條約完全根據平等互惠原則，而在此我國東南海口悉被封鎖之際，對於抗戰建國的助益，自然特別重大，蘇聯對我忠誠友誼，自然更可作為其他各國的模範。</p>
<p>（二）中法信用放款，總額一百五十萬磅，據傳已於六月廿二日成立，對於發展遠東和平陣綫，亦有重要的助力。</p>
<p>（三）英法協商遠東聯防的新加坡會議，已於六月廿五日圓滿結束，詳細內審尙守秘密，所已公佈的是英法兩國已决定戰時合作辦法，並與美維持密切聯絡。</p>
<p>（四）英美互易原料的物物交換協定，巳於六月廿三日簽字。</p>
<p>（五）英波軍事協定，已起草完竣，日內卽可簽宇。</p>
<p>（六）英羅金融談判，已於六月廿四日成立協定。</p>
<p>（七）法土兩國共同保障地中海安全的協定，已於六月廿三日正式簽字。</p>
<p>（八）巴爾幹各國實行新聯防的已在積極籌備。</p>
<p>（九）美國對於日本排外，態度漸趨堅强（中央社廿三日華盛頓電）美國政界熱烈討論禁運軍火赴日，（同上廿四日電）</p>
<p>最後再說到英蘇談判，據中央社廿九日倫敦電稱，英國政府鑒於情勢急迫，對於蘇聯建議，已准備「全部接受」，並訓令駐蘇大使西慈，授予全權，儘可能迅速成立協定。反侵略的怒潮，是一波高一波的在淘　起來了！</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>二·榮譽的殘廢兵</p>
<p>同我們一道來的車輛，不是還載着一部份榮譽殘廢軍人　？他們看見「×寇不消滅，勇士羞人此門」的標語，似乎都各有一番感慨，有一位竟為之陷入良久的深思也許他正在默　「壯志未成身先「殘」，常使英雄淚滿襟」的傷心事，不料車行相讓緊擦電線桿而過，他扶在車廂邊上而忘了戒備的左臂，不幸又被擦斷了四指，當時又無醫藥準備，僅拿點棉花和友人贈我的一塊A字手帕替他裹傷，但他搖首　謝：「怕將手帕弄聯了！」可敬可愛的榮譽戰士啊！你們在前線殺×，怎樣的克己忍痛？怎樣的英勇權牲，從這兒我們巳看出偉大精袖來了！</p>
<p>他們旣同是榮譽的殘廢兵，當然各有一叚可歌可泣奮鬥史。有一位細高個子的山東人，在××激烈戰役，因深入×陣被俘，他親眼看見：×人用許多慘酷的方法，辱殺我已失抵抗能力的戰士和平民。</p>
<p>他因為是個瘦人，還長着一身癬疥之類的皮膚病，×人誤認他有阿芙蓉　，不曾殺他，還想利用他。可是雖不殺他，却百般侮辱他，每次叫他吃剩湯殘飯時，都不準他用筷用手，而浪四肢爬地，作狗吃食狀……幸終于從虎口逃出，屢經激戰，斬獲甚多，最近才帶着榮譽傷到後方來。</p>
<p>另有位紫檀色的矮胖靑年，他從貴州自費　到那時尙未失的南昌，投考航空，因名落孫山，率性投身行伍，轉戰大江北岸各地，直至腿部　了重傷，仍想在火線拚命可是長給他四元法幣，定要叫他自行爬退。後來慢慢爬下，中途如何被　架隊抬到醫院？有次一覺　來如何會失了一支小腿？都茫無所知，後來　愈轉送到此，沿途都有人熱烈招待，有的還贈送「民族英雄」的紀忿章，實在令他太高與了。他說他現在已養得這麽胖，綱要想個法子，得再和×人痛痛快快地拚一下，他繼甘心！</p>
<p>他們又說：傷兵曾經施用手續，　去一手一腿　，可驗成頭等殘廢；若傷右眼，或手足不靈活的，是二等殘廢；如傷左眼者，則為三等殘廢。各等殘廢，薪　完全照發，以至終身。若願囘家休養，可發六十元以上之旅費，俟戰事結束，頭等殘廢每年並可領卹金二百元，二等一百元，三等七八十元，可是他們幷不希望這樣的坐食安事，他們等到了比較安全的地方，還要盡可能的從事生產工作，好似在前綫一樣的得努力　將　人消滅！</p>
<p>褒城距滿中四十餘里，所過全是肥美田地。正在傾　榮譽戰士們放大嗓音的談話，汽車却已駛攏易於引起懷　幽思的漢中城了。</p>
<p>三·各色燈光下的南鄭</p>
<p>漢中城，雖然以昭烈帝做漢中王得名；但實際上的漢中王故鄉，是在沔縣城東舊州舖（距南鄭一百數十里，舊有大堡，已被溪水冲場不堪），而不是目前的南鄭縣城矣。可是以地勢開廣，物產擊　，交通便利，文化水平較高各項來說，稱南鄭為陝南漢中區的代表縣，却也當之而無愧。</p>
<p>城中各主要大街，尙相當寬潔，惜道旁植樹，為數寥寥，×機雖先後到此投彈兩次，但經常入口之增多，市面之繁榮，新式商店之相繼建築，毫未受其壤影響。西北聯合大學及其他學校，已有一部份遷設此間；舊有小型石印報一家，最近西京日報又到此刊漢中版，均可為漢中文化事業生色。</p>
<p>人民普通所穿服裝，談話空調，生活方式，都大有四川風味，記者初到的那晚上，先入澡堂洗澡，茶房拒收小眼，却感到這是川陝各地所無的一種美俗。夜間僅后街，東關比較熱鬧，當往　禮，見商店營業所用燈類，電燈，煤氣，洋臘，油火，各投所好，殊不一致，有些甚至毫無燈光的，却須摸索前進，但時聞兒童抗戰歌聲，可為衝破層層黑寂之一助。有兩處大放光明的，是兩家電影院；一映「蘇俄驅　記」，觀衆殊形擁擠；一映「關東大俠」，門客寥寥可數。接着走到東門，又見一處在大放異　，可是趣前一看，却非常令人曳氣：那是大做超度亡魂的迷信勾當，那時法輪尙未大轉，五六個紅眼黃皮的道士，正對着燈燭輝煌的神位，捫虱而談，恬不知恥。</p>
<p>有些自以為「葛大氏之民無　氏之　」的聖人賢人們，不，「　人閑人」們，儘管時局緊張萬分，他們總是成天的躺在茶舘裏嘖茶如故，茶舘裏有說　的，自拉自唱的，內容前者不外是「乾隆下江南」，後者不外是「貴妃醉酒」之類；另外還吸引住一羣貧苦靑年，鵠立在馬路上竊聽出神，還有兩家　秦腔和平劇的戲院，看廣吿也是多演陳腐低趣的戲劇，假若不想法于把這類作風痛改一下，不知今後還將造出多少人閑人的徒子徒孫來！</p>
<p>歸返旅舘，査號憲兵憲正向近隣房間的一個旅客大開敎訓；他操着長沙口　說：『你要知道，關於這類書籍，就在我們軍界方面，僅將官階級　略資參考；餘如校尉以下，都在禁閱之列，你旣從成都來此升學，怎好買這類書籍來看？還說什麽書店公開發賣，什麽不過研究性質，如果把你帶進司令部去，起碼四個月才得自由！』</p>
<p>『那個客人也自討苦吃，』茶房邊開門邊輕聲說：『誰叫他這個時候還要買日本×子書來看！』</p>
<p>結果僅沒收其書，囑賬房先生明日代為送部，借閱一過，串好却不是茶房信口　黃所說的什麽日本　子書！（完）</p>

<p>這個消息的正確性，我們要愼重的保留。</p>
<p>本來，一個國家在戰時，其外交政策本應更加巧　運用，使有利於我抗戰，而孤立敵國，爭取敵人之盟國的中立及轉而叻我，尤爲重要；這是一般的原則。因此，縱使我國確有向德國購買軍火之事，祇要不含政治性的附件，祗要是純粹的商業性的，也就無足疑慮。</p>
<p>不過，在我們中國人民，尤其是曾經飽受日×運用德意炮火之殘害的人民，則不能不有所驚訝，特別是分化日×與德意的企圖，旣早被公認爲　想，早被事實所紛碎，英國進行中之「破壞德意軍事同盟」的計劃，又爲無情的事實所打破，甚至反而增加了中國與英國所受的威脅的嚴重性；此外，我們還要認淸我們運用策略，德國與日×豈不知運用策略？縱使不含政治作用，其交換條件是否　得亦成疑問。</p>
<p>在汪逆受命進行「反共反蘇」運動之際，在英日準備進行東京談判之際，這個消息之傳出，若非×人有意惑亂視聽，則其可靠性更應大爲減低。</p>

<p>不但此也，香港是福地，　　　　　　」，有的是錢，與其一夜化上幾上出入歌台舞榭，費時耗財傷神，何若叫上一個按摩女來，旣可舒筋暢骨，有裨衛生；而又秀色可餐，惠而不費，而目同時，預期的目的，一樣也可以達到，舍捷徑而不由，不亦愚　。</p>
<p>由是觀之，女子按摩一業將來的發達，當可豫卜矣，女子職業又闢一新蹊徑，我為之痛哭流涕。</p>

<p>究竟為了怎樣一個起因，使我開始對倫竊行為發生興趣，一時，我也記不起來了。多半，我對於這一行。頗具天才罷。話，這樣一說，我知道你們準得誤會；一定以為，我是一個專幹偷竊，扒拿那些玩意兒的，這一誤會，却非同小可，我的名譽，豈不全被你們毀了嗎？所以，我不能不聲明，我並不是　偷竊過活的專門職業人才，我的偶然來一下子，僅僅是業餘性質而巳。</p>
<p>還有一件，不能不說的，就是，我不是個男子，我是個女人，受過大學敎育　一離學校的門，就帶若張文憑，嫁若一位挺能掙錢的丈夫，衣，食，住，行件件不愁，儘有閒錢，讓我花，買我心愛的東西，可是，憑這樣，更與了我許多行事上的方便，因為，一位穿着得挺華貴的太太，談吐不俗，舉止大方，走到那兒，人家也不會疑心你是「賊」呀！誰知我就正好乘人不備，大施技倆。</p>
<p>我的地盤，總不外乎幾家大商店，大公司。隨便買點什麽，總能順手牽他幾隻羊囘家。頂方便，不費勁的地方，還得算那些百貨公司里，雖然，他們僱有許多人望風，可是誰也不會注意到我身上來，他們釘住的，都是一些衣衫襤褸的人，其實，我也留過神，看看他們是不是我的同志，但是，別瞧他們衣服穿得挺不像樣，他們的心地，倒比我坦白多着呢。這些，我不大敢想，因為，一想到，免不了要慚愧到無地自容。</p>
<p>在公司里，總有一大堆，一大堆的貨物存列着，像另頭衣料呀，　半價的手袋呀，廉價的絲襪呀，我從來不先挑選那一樣是我需要的，才下手，我根本沒有什麼需要不需要，我所等的，只是機會，那兒有下手的機會，毫不猶豫，拿了就走——是怎麼拿法？對不起，我可不能吿訴你們，免得讓你們學了乖去，——到家，打開一張大概子的鬥，望里一擲，行啦，完事、我精神上已經得了安慰，東西不東西，原來我就不在乎，是不是？</p>
<p>偷那些廉價的東西，是最省事的，可是，義手段高强，幷不喜歡玩那些容易的玩意兒，也正如，進了大學的人，就不願意帶着塊石板做加減乘除一樣，旁人雖然不管我的閑帳，可是自己却怕失了身份。所以，我的大櫃子里，也放着有幾十塊錢一瓶的巴黎香水，高價的西書，金銀首飾，不過，我從來不去用它們，也不去看它們。</p>
<p>你們許要問啦：你這樣幹法，難道從來沒有被人發覺過嗎？唉！沒有法子想，我也瞞不了你們，反正，現在，我巳經决定洗手不幹了，讓我說給你們聽吧。我最近出過醜啦！</p>
<p>這一次，我打算做一件從來沒試過的玩意兒，偷人家手里的錢包。我打定主意，要一試身手，出門時，我自己故意不帶錢包，到了一家生意最好的百貨商店，我就左張右望，似乎是想貿點東西，其實，我是在找下手的目的物，恰巧，來啦，在一處賣童裝的櫃前，櫃上滿堆着小孩衣服，有一位中年太太，正在替他那大約五六歲的美麗可愛的小女兒試新衣，店里售貨員眼光，也都射在她們母女身上，獨有我，別具隻眼，看中了她放在衣堆里的一只錢包，我裝出漫不在意的態度，挨到她們旁邊，眼睛也似乎在看那小女孩，其實，乘着人們不在意，我一伸手，就在衣堆里，取到了那只錢包，多麽輕鬆容易！我將它向脅下一挾，似乎這原來是我自己帶的一樣。我開步走了，預備出店門，天啊！有一隻堅硬的手臂，攔住了我的去路，同時，我聽見那位太太在高叫若，找她的錢包，以下，唉！不用說了，她跑過來，將我手里的錢包一把奪去。拍！我的臉上着了一巴掌，這個有若堅硬的手臂的店員，還有着堅硬的心腸呢，我眞想不到，那傢伙有這麼大的膽量，巴掌，光臨到我的頰上，眞是破天荒的奇蹟，當時，我幾乎昏過去了，但是，幸虧沒有傷我撫着頰，踉蹌的出了店門，只聽見，那傢伙勝利的笑着說，「我早就留心她啦，以前，她似乎也來過呢。」</p>
<p>我回到家里，這次、空手而歸，打開大櫃子的門，將我自己擲進那大堆臟物之間，放聲大哭。從此，我向上天立下了毒誓，以後，决心洗手不幹了。</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員廿爾，趁德輪『凱柏隆齊號』去遊歷歐洲。在船上接着消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。不久，又遇釗冰山，和英艦的炮擊，好容易地逃出虎口，囘到美境白海。傑克與比爾便囘紐約去、見到邱克斯先生。邱又叫他們趁「聖烏克號」去歐洲找他的兒子</p>
<p>「不錯，但是我不以為他是這個名字，另外還有一個名字。啊，算啦，就記起來，又有什麽用——反正，强生先生，脾氣不大好，剛才你拒絕他那封信件，我想他半個身子都爆漲起來啦。」</p>
<p>對於這位發脾氣旅客的批評，突然中斷了，因為有一個聲音衝到傑克耳中，那時，有一個聽筒沒有掛好，他趕快將它放準，然後向比爾露齒一笑。</p>
<p>「這是我們的老朋友，「勃維克號」，」他說，「她在外面等我們，但是這一次，胆大放心，我們飄的是美國旗。」</p>
<p>「聖瑪克號」在大西洋面停住了，巡洋艦漸漸近來，若像以前，在「凱隆伯齊號」上，這該是多麼驚心動魄的情景。</p>
<p>『看起來，我們和她很有交情，是不是？』傑克說，他們正看着「勃維克號」在靠近來，大約五百碼遠近。</p>
<p>「要不是有那一場大霧，恐怕交情還更深一層呢，」比爾笑着，『看啦，他們放隻小船來。』</p>
<p>巡洋艦旁邊，放下一隻小船，坐滿了戎裝的兵士，在船尾上，坐若一個　神氣的下級軍官，一排漿，整齊，合拍地打着水面。「聖瑪克號」連忙放下小梯，不到一會工夫，那年靑的英國軍官就上了大船</p>
<p>頭等艙的客廳里，旅客們都站作一行，囘答一些關於國籍的問句，全無困難的過去了。於是，到二等艙，再末等艙。在二等艙里，兩個德國後備軍，被　出去作囚犯了，末等艙里，有六個之多。他們對於被捕，似乎毫不介意，雖然，他們知道，這一被捕就得囚在哈立法或百爾慕他羣島，直要等到戰事了結，才能重見天日呢。</p>
<p>傑克和比爾看得頗感興趣。</p>
<p>『我猜想起來，總得好幾個月，或者好幾年，這些可憐虫方能再看見他們的家哩。』比爾說。</p>
<p>「是呀，但是，你也可以說這是戰爭時的幸運者。」傑克無窮的感嘆。</p>
<p>巡查工作進行得很快，一個鐘點之後，犯人也提走了，一切都通過了。兩條船互相致過敬禮，就分開了。「勃維克號」繼續做他的巡杳工作，「聖碼克號」繼續他的航程。</p>

<p>（上海特訊）上海物價、在平時因與國內各地有相當連繫　　目上海為全國商業中心、進出口貨物集散要地　故其一漲一落、每為人所重視、戰後上海物價、則以供求失常、與夫政府統制外匯、引起黑市外匯之劇烈變動、致促成畸形上漲、影響市民生計甚鉅、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>騰漲情形至足驚人</p>
<p>戰後無論農產品工業品礦產品多趨上漲、（一）農產品騰漲百分之一百以上者凡三、荼葉、五棓子、烟葉、百分之五十以上者凡五、桐油、紅糧、生絲、木料、苞米、百分之三十以上者凡四、棉花、花生油、芝蔴、黃牛皮、百分之二十六以下者凡八、西貢米、白梗米、小麥黃豆、乾繭、猪　、食鹽、生油、（二）工業品如麵粉、綿紗、布疋、綢緞、紙、五金、水泥、顏料及化學原料等、乃無一不趨上漲、尤以進口貨之顏料、化學原料、五金、報紙、漲勢為盛、綿紗布疋漲勢亦不弱、原因一為外洋運費增加、二為　市外匯緊縮、以至成本隨之而貴、（三）鑛產品其應用廣而比較重要者、如煤、鑛物汕、銅、鐵、錫、鉛、銻、等、共中煤漲百分之一百以上、蓋煤為工業及家庭日用必需品、油因黑市外匯緊縮，價格飛漲、其他鑛產品因運輸關係亦相繼飛漲約百分之三十至五十之間、</p>

<h3 id="c39">同學 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>人與人之間的結合，因血統關係而有「同姓」，因地域關係而有「同鄉」，都是有好處的，不在話下：此外因出身關係而有「同學」，似乎未嘗沒有好處，我也不能不分些筆墨之勞，代爲表彰一番。</p>
<p>在幾年之前，我們曾聽見過「某大系」〔某大學的同學〕把持着某省的教育，於是某省的教育界就成了「某大同學會」。範圍略小些，某校的教職員，都是某大學的同學，於是某校也就或了「某大同學會」。同樣，我們也聽見，某省的司法官，都是某法政學校的同學，於是某省的司法界，就成了「某法校的同學會；」或者都是留學某國的同學，於是成了『留某國的同學會』。……一成同學，聲價十倍，保障飯碗有着，可以吃着不盡。此卽所謂同學的好處也。</p>
<p>旣是「同學會」，『非同學』當然只有被排擠出來，而挿不進脚去。這些「非同學」當然是要怨恨，要憤怒的。可是我爲他們打算，卻以爲大可小必，誰又沒有同學呢？爲什麼自己不也造成幾個「同學會」來玩玩，却要去仰人鼻息，或者想分人杯羹呢？只要自己淘夥裏團體紮得緊，有神通，歷古以來原許人們造成淸一色而排斥異己的，何必客氣呢？造成了自己的同學會，也就可以坐享其成了。</p>
<p>原來凡是同學，總一定是很講義氣，會極盡彼此互助的能事的。譬如說古來的孫濱和龐涓吧，我也以爲他們倆無負於同學之誼；因爲孫濱沒有龐涓，那裏會被斷去了膝蓋骨，流芳百世，作個大丈夫，而寵涓沒有孫濱，那裏會被射死馬陵道中，遺臭萬年，也作個大丈夫！——大丈夫不能流芳百世，亦當遺臭萬年，按此類推，所以他們的後輩同學蘇秦和張儀，雖然一般看來，似乎主張各異，感情也並不不算好。可是你一個合縱，他一個連橫，一吹一唱，相得益彰，以異曲同工之妙，彼此都取得了卿相。　四個人，在六國間就此結成了一個小小『鬼大（鬼谷大學）同學會』，眞可以和現代『某大同學會』先後媲美。</p>
<p>再譬如說管寧和華歆吧，雖然弄到「割席」，我以爲他們還是不愧爲同學。因爲華歆的建功立業，甚至參加「逼宮」的盛舉，到底是管寧激成的，而管寧的高尚其事，不事王侯，又未始非華歆所養成？這也是相反相成，各有千秋的一格。</p>
<p>再以現事而論，我們也常聽見說：某校有同學，不務正業，專門向其他的同學借錢，同學會特爲發通吿，大家不要被騙：某校有某學，犯了不名譽的刑事案子，被羈獄中，同學會連忙登報否認，他們沒有這個同學，……諸如此類的事情，我仍舊認爲同學很講義氣，肯彼此互助，因爲這樣一來，也就足以使鄙夫廉，懦夫有立志了，他們是公承「鬼大同學會」的一貫作風的。至於爲邶與已有利的同學，添隻把飯碗，那當然是題中應有的文章，不足掛齒了。</p>
<p>同學會的德政，在這一方面，眞正美不勝牧，確要使我於表彰之外，再立下予欲無言的决心。可是還有和同學會一樣美的，也許更爲美好的事情，我却又不能不連類一書，否則我總覺得我所見之不廣。</p>
<p>這是所謂「同山門」，簡言之爲「同山」或「同產」。「同山」可以帮着講斤頭，打相打，固然是人所皆知的美點，而一朝要成大事，假使你是「大哥」，更非有許多『同山』的「賢弟」帮忙不可，趙匡胤朱元璋之流的得以身登九五，就靠着這一點。現今此風漸漸流入了士大夫階級，頗有取「同學會」而代之之勢，說不定同學會竟會遭淘汰吧！</p>
<p>不過在「同學會」沒有遭淘汰之前，我總是艷羨着「同學少年多不賤，五陵裘馬自輕肥」。我恨不得挿身每一個這樣的『同學會』中去！</p>
<h3 id="c40">江邊 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 于塞夫</p>
<p>輕輕從階梯上一級級的路下去，我們看到江水在激流：霧，彌漫在水面上……許多襤褸的人，臉黃肌瘦，挑着兩只木桶，一級級的跨下去，一直到江面上，便挑上了兩滿桶的水，那麼沉重地。</p>
<p>江邊的水，是多麼渾濁啊。但是，沒有它，人們就不能生活。沿着江邊，從那密集的破落的屋宇間飄出來的炊烟，跟銀霧結合在一起了。</p>
<p>江邊的街道大抵是坭濘的，整天不會乾。</p>
<p>哦，這不過是春天的水流。</p>
<p>到了夏天，當山間的積雪溶解的時候，它就像瀑布一樣的冲下來，一直冲到江裏，江水便整日整夜的漲起來。</p>
<p>一個老年人對我們說：『這裏的夏天，常常是屬於洪水的呵。』</p>
<p>當我們問他可知道日本　　　，他的臉孔的神色，立時緊張了，他指着右邊的一個荒蕪的尾宇間的缺口。</p>
<p>『就是那裏，　　　　的飛機投下了十來顆炸彈，死了六十多個人……』</p>
<p>『你不怕麼？』我們之間有一個人問他。</p>
<p>「怕什麼？反正是這樣。我們祇有幹到底！</p>
<p>『　　連三歲的小孩子都懂得了呢。』他夾着一對濕潤潤的眼睛，他手裏的衣服是污穢的，他把牠放在石塊上，用一根木棒不住的槌打着。</p>
<p>一個老年的男子，蹲在江邊洗滌衣服，在鄉間簡直是很罕少的。——可以說，在我還是第一次看到。</p>
<p>「爲什麽你自己來洗衣服呢？」</p>
<p>『沒有人……兒子出去當兵了。他寫信來說他們幹的眞有勁。……媳婦……媳婦在那次轟炸中炸死了，還有兩個孫子也死了……』</p>
<p>他說到這裏，好像有些顫抖了。臘腸那麽的鼻子底下的微白的鬍髭，跟着他的急促的呼吸而微微顫動。</p>
<p>「……先生，我也不久就要走了，到山裏去種田……我想，我們打仗，粮食也是要緊的。在山裏爾，我遝有一個弟弟……」</p>
<p>「你在這裏幹什麽活？」</p>
<p>「我？我是刨烟絲的……」說着，他把衣服又浸到水裏去，立卽又提了起來，也沒有把它擠乾，就濕淋淋的提着，很難受地走開了。</p>
<p>我們候着一隻小帆船，因爲要渡江。小帆船駛得很慢，很久才靠到石梯邊來，撐船的傢伙，從船上一條跳板擱到石梯上來。</p>
<p>霧依舊飄浮在江面上。江邊的水是多麽渾濁，撑船的傢伙是很靈巧地在扯奢風帆。</p>
<h3 id="c41">生人速寫 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 莊端源</p>
<p>這是一個多殺害的黑暗時代，沒有什麽可說的，戰鬥剛開始的時候，有許多城市大規模地被轟炸着，我到達的一個城市很冷靜地被埋在重山重水之間，一年半以來是那麽恬靜地沒有被野蠻的手撫摸過。我感到有一點喜悅。</p>
<p>於是便有一個慘殺的日子，現代戰爭是包括若廣闊的後方，一個安居着稠密人口的縣城往往成爲轟炸的理想目標。殺害像陽光一樣地平均地分給每一個人，不容許有一點點的選擇。</p>
<p>新製的汽笛發出着沉悶似的聲昔，這是帶點闇暗也帶點着淒厲的聲音，推開了窻，像一支六十四分之一音符的聲樂急遽似地播送進來，　聲在滴滴地響着，窗帘捲起了又放下來。</p>
<p>我想我應該到郊外去，這是一種防衛的本能，一顆炸彈掉下來了，毀了房屋也毀了人，雖然殺害像陽光一樣平均地分給每一個人。不容許有一點點私自的選擇。</p>
<p>街上，如水的車馬遮去了去路，靑石板的路上，一輛輛的車子接啣地拖過去，單身的人從房屋裏奪門而出，看見慌亂的人羣也不覺自擾起來，一隻手抓緊了口袋裏的錢，另一隻手按住頭頂上的帽子，衝到人羣裏去。帶着孩子的母親用手掌掩蓋了孩子哭喊的嘴，年靑的媳婦背着婆夾在重疊的背脊間，用搖搖的脚步試探着前進。幾十年前目擊一場大屠殺的老婦人，眼睛是昏花的，手裏卻不忘記那一大串檀木的捻珠。儘管她未曾經歷過這時代的屠殺眞象，她唸者禪語。</p>
<p>一個年輕的少婦突然昏厥似地倒在我的身上，我一伸手，完全是出於偶然的，觸着了她的胸脯，我縮了囘來。然後，她是那麽很狼狽似地站立起來，匆匆地各自走開。</p>
<p>時間用無聲的脚步往後邊溜去。</p>
<p>我來到這城市的郊外，人們已經在土堆後，在橋脚下，費盡了心思，計算著角度光線和陰影，企圖盡量減少對於天空的反射。一種細微的但是在高張起人的飛機的轟鬧聲在我的　覺上像反覆過去的記憶似地敘述起來晤示着，又是一場殘殺潛行。我找到了一條沒有遮蓋的壕溝，於是走進去。</p>
<p>狹窄的壕溝已經擠着幾個人，是的，沒有什麽可說的，每一個人都像沉湎在苦苦的思想中，甚至互相交換一次眼風都沒有。我只能雊在狹窄的土溝站立着，發現了一個生人的脆弱的靈魂是在無意中。他走進來，瑟索地立在我的身後，用肘子碰了我一下。</p>
<p>我背轉了臉去看他，差不多同時地我凝視着了。一個肥胖的身體，光禿的額門，穿着整潔的絲棉袍子，而且在黑馬褂的口袋裏一條　重的鏢鍊墜着。我凝視着了，那圓胖的臉已經消失原有的紅潤，漸漸由蒼灰的顏色脫出靑黑的痕迹。</p>
<p>飛機在遠遠的天空做成緊密的九個黑點。</p>
<p>這樣一個高貴的人，他有一條沉重的鏢鍊，他有錢，單是那沉重的鏢鍊，我知道，他應該怯懦，應該永遠保持着自己的生命去享受他的生活。可是飛機迫近了，洪亮的馬達　使人生怕。我看見他蹲下去，卑鄙似地蹲在我的脚邊，我等一次驕傲似地我在庇護一個生命，一個脆弱的生命在我的脚邊顫抖起來，隨着馬達聲的高張，漸漸顫抖得更利害。但是我還覺得我不能使他放心，他還會以爲躲在我的脚邊，不太安全。當然，最好是他縮小了，那麼肥胖的人縮小得像一個小珠子，而我彎下腰去把這顆小珠子拾起來，放在自己的衣袋，當飛機盤旋在我們的頭的時候。這應該還不是不體面的事，當馬達聲遠去的時候，我又　小珠子從衣袋裏出來，讓她們變成一個肥胖的人，依然有錢，掛着他那沉重的鏢鍊，囘到城市裏去，他仍然會是一個幸福的人。伸伸腰過着他的富　的生活。</p>
<p>第一顆炸彈的聲音饗了，同時第一聲高射砲也響了。九架輕轟炸機在天空中散開，散開了彷彿飛機的數目增加了。這是有點恐怖的吧，機關槍的子彈也開始從飛機上發射下來。蹲在我脚邊的那脆弱的生命又顫抖起來了，我看見他正低縮着腦袋，把臉深深地埋在自己的兩手間。是的，要是在這溝　裏冉聯接着另外一條小嚎溝，他定然會撤開四肢，悄悄地爬進去的。</p>
<p>一聲連緜的咳嗽從壕溝的另一端起來，那好像是一個肺結核的病症者的咳嗽。求覺得是誰的肩膀在我的腿上撞了一下，低下臉去看，那生人已抑起了臉，并且哀求似地說了。</p>
<p>「先生，請他別咳嗽。」</p>
<p>我聽見的是一個顫慄的聲音，低微的，但是殷切似的。一個人咳嗽一聲應該有他的權利，我沉默。</p>
<p>終於他站起半個身子，樑出一點頭，用責叱的聲音說：</p>
<p>「喂！別作聲。」</p>
<p>嗽又禁不住似的起來了，而且彷彿還更利害一點。</p>
<p>「你想死嗎？飛機在頭頂上，你在地上咳嗽。」</p>
<p>「咳嗽便怎樣？」</p>
<p>飛機上聽見了　一顆炸彈你担保得起嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣的話引起了一陣放浪的笑聲，但是第三個人立刻挿進來說話，彷彿是轉變了當時的空氣。</p>
<p>『中國人整千整萬地去犧牲地在犧牲，有誰担保嗎？』</p>
<p>「好，你罵人，操你……」</p>
<p>一架飛機瞄準着百碼以內的住宅區投下一顆重磅的重彈，炸彈的威力使氣壓也改變了，土溝裏的坭塊紛紛地震落下來，這炸彈打斷了那盛氣凌人的話。</p>
<p>『還是把鏢鍊取下來吧，鏢鍊會反光的。』</p>
<p>我看見一隻肥胖而白潤的手舉上來，悄悄地摘去沉重似的鏢鍊。</p>
<h3 id="c42">撲向了祖國 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>於是她走了，連同幾個的工作的同伴。那是在一個睛朗的下午，她們在對海的車站上搭車。</p>
<p>三等車廂裏的人很多，可是她聽不懂他們的話，相同地他們也不會聽得懂她們的話。據說只有三小時的行車就可以到達目的地，那麽她心中討算着，去安排住處，吃一頓晚飯，天也還不會黑下來的。</p>
<p>車輪有力地在鐵軌上滾過去，像不平似地發着騷音，她的心情卻像一張經路塗寫的白紙。記得從前，也坐在火車上離開居住的地方，是走着一步步沉重的路：囘到居住的地方來，有一顆漸漸輕鬆而愉快的心。如今是什麼都沒有，雖然她時時想來克眼對於家的無用的想念，心上總也留些異常的感覺；她失去了個人的瑣細的哀與樂，她的心，和多少個靑年人的心相同，赤誠地爲了整個民族的復興而跳動，有時像漠然，可是實質地在殷切地期望着那憧憬中的絕大的快慰。</p>
<p>好像走了三分之一的路程，就越出租借地的界限，在自己治理下的地方，有的自然是建設不足，有的顯然留了來×機麼手所摧毀的殘跡。同車的人隔着玻實指點在說給他們的同伴，可是她一點也聽不懂，只從他們的神情上來觀察，知道他們的胸中蘊滿了憤慨。</p>
<p>青芷一壁走一壁自己尋思着，她想起自從開戰以來，雖然做了一點工作，但是直接地來躲避屠殺的經驗還沒有過，在報紙上她看到×人的飛機炸死多少無辜的人民，就是在那畸形的租界以內，她也會痛心地望着×機三五成羣地在四面低飛投彈；可是那些炸彈不會落到租界裏來，所以那些　商們，闊家的小姐們，有錢的公子寄兒們，連同她自己仍然能不損一根毛髮地生存着，通着太平的歲月。　樣的生活，怎麽能對得起爲了捍衛國土而把自己的鮮血灑在地上的弟兄們呢？　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Concerning the Evacuation of Capital from Shanghai <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zejin</p>
<p>The ever-increasing prices in Shanghai have become the most serious phenomenon here. This publication has previously earnestly requested scholars and experts to discuss in detail the reasons for this and methods to stabilize the situation. Many gentlemen have expressed insightful opinions, but it seems that few have offered concrete and practical suggestions and methods.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the rising prices in Shanghai are due to many factors, such as reduced production, reduced supply, concentrated population, and the establishment of a black market for foreign exchange. However, in addition to these reasons, the significant expansion of currency in circulation in Shanghai is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the rising prices. In the previous symposium, some gentlemen, especially Mr. Guangdi, said that "the amount of currency in circulation in Shanghai after the war is not only less than before the war, but also seems to be tighter." This may refer to the situation just after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, but since the National Army withdrew westward, the wealthy from all over the country have concentrated in Shanghai. Along with them came large amounts of capital. The sharp increase in bank deposits after the war and the current atmosphere of optimism and speculation in the market are clear evidence of this. Because the capital is concentrated in one area, it has created the current special prosperity, which is also the cause of the current high prices. Therefore, to stabilize prices, in addition to studying and dealing with the other reasons mentioned above, it seems that more effort should be put into how to properly evacuate the surplus capital concentrated in Shanghai. As for the methods of evacuation, I see two points:</p>
<p>First, the government should issue a short-term financial treasury bond designed to regulate Shanghai's finances, authorizing the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong to approve its implementation. The four banks should, in addition to the currency in circulation actually needed in Shanghai, try to use this treasury bond to absorb general floating capital as much as possible. This method is not new. In 1934, Britain also used this method to solve its financial surplus panic at that time. However, in present-day Shanghai, this method has difficulties. First, because Shanghai is an occupied area, although there are concessions, it is questionable whether the environment allows the public promotion of government bonds. Second, the promotion of large amounts of bonds can easily cause misunderstandings among the people and doubts about legal tender.</p>
<p>Second, various banks should organize a large-scale banking syndicate to encourage and absorb the capital of general wealthy people, making planned internal transfers. This capital should be guaranteed by the banks with a corresponding interest rate for a considerable period of time. At the same time, the government should also guarantee the interests of the banks. This method can arouse the interest of general asset holders in investing in the interior. Because in the past, their capital would rather stay in Shanghai than move inland, mainly due to their ignorance and uncertainty about the interior. Now that the banks guarantee the interests, they will definitely be happy to help. At the same time, the government guarantees the banks, so it is beneficial and harmless to them.</p>
<p>In addition, such measures as Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong raising the interest rate on interbank deposits to absorb interbank idle capital, various banks raising the interest rate on fixed deposits to reduce the current nature of demand deposits, and refusing to lend funds to general speculators and manipulators are also quite capable of reducing floating capital and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>The above points are just my humble opinions and cannot be regarded as suggestions. I hope that those who pay attention to the issue of Shanghai's capital will have another detailed discussion and study. This is just for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Week in World Trends From June 25th to July 1st, 1939 <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Zhao</p>
<p>The great war of resistance of the Chinese nation is almost two full years old. In order to solve the crisis of total collapse caused by its military invasion of China, Japan is looking for solutions in the occupied areas of China, in our domestic capital, and internationally. Thus, there is the recent intensification of the coastal and northwest battles, the activities of Wang Ni and his chorus of echoers, and the Anglo-Japanese conflict and Anglo-Japanese negotiations. All of this is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Like our country, the old British Empire is also threatened by invaders, and the situation is even more serious than in our country. However, its policies to deal with the invasion and their implementation are not as firm and rapid as ours. Therefore, the negotiations with the Soviet Union for mutual assistance have not yet yielded results, and it is constantly putting itself in unfavorable positions with Japan and Germany. In the East, the Tianjin incident is becoming increasingly serious, and the entire Far East power is in danger of being expelled. In the West, the situation in Danzig is extremely tight, and the guarantee to Poland has reached the point where it is forced to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Now, let's try to give a brief report on the international situation in the past week:</p>
<p>(1) A Bird's-Eye View of the Overall Situation is Quite Optimistic. We Must Be Vigilant Against the Enemy's Conspiracy</p>
<p>Although important cities have fallen one after another and compatriots all over the country have suffered in China's two-year war of resistance, Japan's attempts to "subdue without fighting," "quick battle and quick decision," and "quick peace and quick settlement" have been completely shattered. Moreover, more than one million soldiers have been killed or injured, and military expenditures have consumed several million. Japan's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of invading China, while we are gradually eliminating corrupt elements and new forces are gradually growing. The shackles of long-term enslavement have been broken, and the dawn of final victory has been revealed. We feel infinite excitement when we take a bird's-eye view of the overall situation of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>At present, Japan has encountered major difficulties militarily and has to place the focus of its invasion of China on politics, with military affairs as a supplement. Therefore, Japan's future military strategy for invading China is to implement "using war to support war," focusing on consolidating the occupied areas, using China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the military and prepare for war, and seizing the opportunity to conquer our entire country. In recent days, although the war of invading China has become more intense on all fronts on the surface, especially the coastal situation in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, the daily intensity has increased. Japan landed in Shantou on June 23, captured Chao'an on June 27, and Dinghai Island on the coast of eastern Zhejiang also fell on June 23. The Japanese army is also actively deploying to attack Fuzhou and Wenzhou; Yuhuan Kantou was forced to abandon on June 28. However, the deployment of these offensives by Japan, in addition to mainly destroying British business in South China and intimidating Britain, the military significance is only to consolidate its occupied areas in eastern China.</p>
<p>At the same time, our various front lines and the rear of the Japanese army have made considerable progress. First, the heroes of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi have broken the Japanese army's seven attacks in late June, captured Yuanqu on the 25th and Fuluo on the 26th. More than 20,000 Japanese troops who invaded south were annihilated by more than 2,000 in a few days. Secondly, our army in northern Guangdong achieved a victory in the counterattack. On the 28th, a unit rushed into the Longyandong Yantang Shahe area on the outskirts of Guangzhou. In addition, considerable gains have been made in the fierce battles in Yixing on the eastern front and in various parts of southern Shandong.</p>
<p>However, at present, while consolidating the occupied areas and using war to support war, Japan is taking a posture of focusing on attacking Shanxi and Shaanxi, actually coordinating with political conspiracies to undermine our active, comprehensive, and protracted war. Therefore, we cannot privately rejoice in the temporary safety of a corner of the southwest, and we must actively and comprehensively launch an offensive to break Japan's conspiracy to use war to support war.</p>
<p>(2) Wang Ni Runs Around North and South to Sell Out the Country. The Name of the Puppet New Government is Determined</p>
<p>We already know that Japan's invasion of China has fallen into extreme difficulties and crises, and Japan's own strength cannot solve these difficulties and crises. Therefore, it is urgently seeking to strengthen the rule of the occupied areas in order to intensify the use of China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to solve its difficulties and crises, increase its combat effectiveness, and divide our war of resistance forces in order to conquer our entire country.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's betrayal and his proposition and activities of "anti-Chiang, anti-Communist, and anti-war of resistance" have become the most appropriate tool for Japan.</p>
<p>This week, Wang Ni and his wife have been running around the north and south, preparing for Japan to establish a puppet new government on the occasion of the second anniversary of the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, in order to unify and strengthen Japan's rule over the occupied areas. According to Reuters, the puppet new government will be named the "National Government," and its ruling scope will include all occupied areas south of the Longhai Line in South China. It will potentially use the Qingquan White Sun national flag with a five-color flag in the lower corner as the puppet national flag. The puppet temporary government in Beiping will continue to maintain itself on a semi-independent principle, and will announce that all Kuomintang members who oppose Chiang Kai-shek are allowed to operate in the territory of the "National" government, and the Japanese military will train troops for the puppet new government.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei is thus acting as a dog for Japan in name and in fact. It is not surprising that traitors become traitors. It is also not unexpected that the puppet new government may not be able to survive safely due to internal disputes between the Japanese and Chinese traitors and the development of our battles behind the enemy lines. What we currently consider serious: First, the Japanese, Wang Ni, etc. may further put on a political trick, such as "appeasing" the occupied areas and "withdrawing troops from Guangzhou," etc. Second, some of the people who value private and temporary rights above the interests of the country and the nation are expressing their agreement with a part of Wang Ni's proposition in words and in facts, which is precisely what Japan and Wang Ni are aiming at in dividing us. We still need everyone to be more vigilant and increase our self-confidence!</p>
<p>(3) Britain and Japan Prepare for Tokyo Talks. Our Country Calls on the Powers to Be Vigilant</p>
<p>In order to solve the current difficulties and crises, in addition to coordinating with the above-mentioned military and political conspiracies, Japan also has a policy of intimidating Britain. The purpose of this strategy is (1) to destroy and forcibly seize all the interests and properties of Britain in China in order to monopolize the "development" of its occupied areas, and (2) to induce Britain to compromise with Japan and jointly pressure our country to surrender to Japan. The steps for the implementation of this strategy are (1) to blockade the British concession in Tianjin, forcibly occupy Shantou Chao'an Dinghai, and cut off foreign trade in Fuzhou and Wenzhou, using these to threaten Britain, (2) to intensify the provocation against the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. For the past week, the situation on the Soviet-Mongolian border has been extremely serious. This is to induce Britain and at the same time can promote its Western and Italian allies to settle down and immediately take action to form an alliance with Britain from the West, (3) After the above steps have been carried out, Xinjin agreed to hold Tokyo talks and attempted to expand the scope, that is, the talks are not limited to the Tianjin incident, but also involve the basic problem of the entire Anglo-Japanese national relations, that is, attempting to turn Tokyo into Munich, inducing the British government to cooperate with Japan to subdue our country, and then driving out all British forces in the Far East.</p>
<p>Our Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui immediately broadcast to Europe on the 28th, pointing out that Japan's aggression is endless, and attempting to compromise is seeking skin from a tiger, which not only cannot solve the Far East crisis, but also leads to further demands. Our Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gu Weijun also delivered a speech earlier on the 28th, denouncing Japan's aggression, which not only destroys China's territorial sovereignty, but also when China is swallowed up, the interests of foreign countries in the Far East will inevitably not be spared. This kind of warning naturally has a considerable impact on the international community. Political circles in London have expressed that "Britain does not intend to change its established policy on the Far East issue." However, we must recognize that we want to strive for foreign aid, but not rely on it. What we rely on is self-reliance and the mobilization of all the people. Only by relying on the people, adhering to unity and war of resistance, and breaking all the conspiracies of the enemy can we not be shaken by changes in external forces, just like a swimmer who is not drowned by water.</p>
<p>(4) Germany Continues to Conspire to Annex Danzig. The British Foreign Secretary Makes His First Lion's Roar</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Japan's threat to Britain has international significance. Sure enough, just like the collapse of the copper drum in the west, the Luozhong bell responded in the east, Japan's Western ally, Germany, has also launched in Europe! Danzig is in danger! Danzig is in danger! These big words have appeared in world newspapers again.</p>
<p>The Free City of Danzig is the lifeline of Poland's 35 million people. It is not only Poland's only port of intake and output economically, but also a crucial link that determines Poland's fate militarily and politically. At the same time, from Germany's point of view, Danzig is a corridor for attacking northeastern Europe. Therefore, taking this corridor first has long been set in Hitler's second step of attack plan.</p>
<p>However, since Poland has repeatedly and resolutely stated that it will never allow Danzig to be annexed by Germany, and Britain has recently solemnly announced its guarantee of Poland's security, Germany's current actions will be the last test of British diplomacy!</p>
<p>Now, Germany's conspiracy to annex Danzig is becoming more urgent, and 4,000 German troops have sneaked into Danzig on the evening of the 28th. The Polish side believes that the situation is serious and has actively prepared for both land and sea to implement new deployments. What about Britain? British Foreign Secretary Halifax made a "first tough" speech on the 29th, saying, "If there is another act of aggression, we will use all our strength to fulfill our oath of resistance!" This is an unprecedentedly clear declaration! However, enlightened politicians such as Eden and Churchill in the British side have long suspected the sincerity of Britain in fulfilling its promise to resist aggression. They have all said that "It is difficult for Britain and France to fulfill their promise to guarantee Poland without the help of the Soviet Union," and where is the sincerity of Britain's negotiations with the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>(5) The Peace Front Has Made Some Progress. Friendship Between China, the Soviet Union, and France Has Increased</p>
<p>Speaking of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, they have been full of twists and turns, almost causing headaches. Soviet Member Zhidanov said it well: "This is enough to prove that Britain and France do not want to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union on the principle of equality. Britain and France actually want to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union in which the Soviet Union unilaterally does all the work and bears all the responsibilities; however, such a treaty cannot be signed by a self-respecting country unless it wants to become a toy. The Soviet Union's military strength and dignity have always been recognized by the world. How can it sign such a treaty?"</p>
<p>However, the international situation can no longer allow the democratic and peaceful countries to continue dreaming! Therefore, the movement to maintain peace and oppose aggression has made considerable progress this week! The main ones are:</p>
<p>(1) China and the Soviet Union signed a trade treaty on June 16. This treaty is completely based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and at this time when all the ports in southeastern China are blocked, its assistance to the war of resistance and national construction is naturally particularly significant. The Soviet Union's sincere friendship with us can naturally serve as a model for other countries.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese-French credit loan, totaling 1.5 million pounds, is said to have been established on June 22, which also provides important assistance to the development of the Far East peace front.</p>
<p>(3) The Anglo-French consultation meeting on joint defense in the Far East in Singapore ended successfully on June 25. The detailed internal investigation is still kept secret. What has been announced is that Britain and France have decided on wartime cooperation methods and maintain close contact with the United States.</p>
<p>(4) The Anglo-American raw material barter agreement was signed on June 23.</p>
<p>(5) The Anglo-Polish military agreement has been drafted and will be signed soon.</p>
<p>(6) The Anglo-Romanian financial negotiations have reached an agreement on June 24.</p>
<p>(7) The agreement on the joint guarantee of Mediterranean security between France and Turkey was officially signed on June 23.</p>
<p>(8) The new joint defense of the Balkan countries is actively being prepared.</p>
<p>(9) The United States' attitude towards Japanese exclusion is gradually becoming stronger (Central News Agency Washington, 23rd) American political circles are enthusiastically discussing the embargo on arms to Japan (same as above, 24th)</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, according to the Central News Agency's telegram from London on the 29th, the British government, in view of the urgency of the situation, has prepared to "accept all" of the Soviet Union's proposals and instructed its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Xici, to grant full power and establish an agreement as soon as possible. The angry tide of anti-aggression is rising higher and higher!</p>

<h3 id="e3">Our Army in Southern Guangdong Achieves a Victory in Counterattack. Eastern Zhejiang is Tense, and the Battle in Jin and Lu is Fierce. Japanese Troops Open up Outside the Pass, and Their Strength is Empty. <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 1st] After the war in eastern Guangdong broke out, we took preemptive action in southern Guangdong and launched a full-line offensive. Japan mainly transferred the original forces to other places, so they collapsed and were forced to abandon important military strongholds such as Shemgang. The Japanese in Xinhui Jiangmen also showed signs of retreat. The Japanese troops along the Yangtze River in E, Xiang, and Gan adopted a defensive posture with the minimum number of troops. We have completed our deployment and will take advantage of the weakness to give them a head-on blow. The situation in eastern Zhejiang is gradually becoming tense, and the battles in the guerrilla areas of Su, Lu, and Ji are extremely fierce. Japan's "mopping up" plan is about to run into a wall. The Japanese troops in Jin have been defeated in every battle, and their strength has been greatly damaged. Their chaotic actions are no longer worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report from Xingji on the 1st] Recently, because of the serious situation on the border between Manchuria and Mongolia, Japan deeply felt that its troop strength was insufficient, and there were no troops to transfer from within the country. Therefore, it has recently transferred a large number of Japanese troops in North China. According to sources, there are many military trains traveling north on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, averaging more than five trains every day and night, all full of combat troops, military vehicles, gasoline, tanks, artillery, and military supplies. These trains all depart from Tianjin and head to the Northeast. According to other sources, Japanese personnel said that from July 1, the Japanese army will completely withdraw all Japanese troops from various stations along the Tianjin-Pukou and Ping-Han Railways and various places in Ji Province and concentrate in Changchun.</p>
<p>Full-Line Counterattack in Southern Guangdong. Japanese Planes Reconnoiter and Bomb Eastern Guangdong for Days</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanfeng News Agency in Shaoguan] After our various armies in Guangdong Province launched a full-scale counterattack, our army in Beijiang, divided into two routes, headed south. One route advanced along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway after recapturing Xinjie, approaching Shijing. Japan urgently increased its troops by more than a thousand to defend the Gang, attempting to resist our other large army surrounding Zengcheng. Another Yuan brigade advanced along Longyandong, and is now launching an offensive towards Longyandong. The sound of gunfire can be clearly heard in Guangzhou. The puppet regime is shaken, and people are leaving the urban area one after another. Taipingchang will be restored soon. Our army in He-Xin, divided into two routes, launched an attack, advancing towards Huicheng. One route recaptured Daxiaomeishan, approaching the suburbs of Xinhui City, and the other route advanced along the Heshan Highway.</p>
<p>[Fast News from Dalu News Agency in Huizhou] The Japanese army that invaded the south launched the Chaoshan War, implementing its so-called conspiracy to intensify its coastal activities. In recent days, more than a dozen Japanese ships of various sizes, including an aircraft carrier, have been moored in the areas of Haomen, Ma, Shanwei, Qiantian, Zhelang, Jiazi, Jinxiang, and Jieshi. On the 30th, according to intelligence from institutions here, three Japanese ships were found on the sea off Shanwei Port, seemingly intending to reconnoiter. A Japanese seaplane was dispatched from the Japanese ship, and after flying low for a week, the Japanese warship fired more than ten shots, randomly bombing the barren islands off our coast. This kind of boring behavior is aimed at probing our reality and is still free of any other abnormalities. On the 27th, seven Japanese planes took off from the Japanese ships in Shanwei, four planes flew to Haili, Zijin, Xingning, and Meixian for reconnaissance, and three planes flew to bomb the county seat of Lufeng, dropping four bombs, killing and wounding more than a dozen civilians. When the Japanese planes bombed, the prisoners in the county prison took the opportunity to escape from prison. Fortunately, the prison guards and police discovered this and immediately divided into groups to intercept them, killing two on the spot. The remaining prisoners, seeing this, did not dare to cross the line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report from Zhaoqing on the 1st] After our army recaptured Daxiaomeishan, it immediately joined forces with a certain unit to attack Jiangmen Xinhui. On the 29th, Wu, the vanguard, occupied Jinniushan, Licun, Shuanglongku and other places, and took advantage of the victory to advance to Ma'anshan, Foziao, and Shichu. In the evening, our plainclothes team attacked Xinhui County, destroying the Japanese power plant and the Japanese-puppet organization, the Tong Sheng Club. The entire city was plunged into darkness and the order was disturbed. At the same time, Jiangmen Zhongshan Park and Yandun Mountain were attacked by our guerrillas, and several battles broke out. Now Jiangmen Xinhui electric messages are not getting through and the situation is chaotic. The Japanese-puppet were in panic and terror, and after responding to the battle in a hurry, they set fire to the nearby villages, seemingly preparing to withdraw.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Report from Chongqing on the 1st] According to Chinese military authorities, the Chinese army has made further progress in Guangdong, recapturing several important stations and pressing to within thirty-one miles of Guangzhou. It is also reported that several thousand Japanese troops in Shantou are holding their ground against the Chinese army northeast of Shantou.</p>
<p>Walled-in Yicheng Under Siege. Small Gains Made in Northern Hunan Offensive</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report from Luoyang on the 30th] The situation in Zhongtiao Mountain, since the recapture of Yuanqu, there have been no Japanese troops from Pinglu to Yuanqu and south of Hengling Pass, and the front line is extremely solid. The Japanese troops who harassed Yicheng on the 27th are being lured and annihilated by our army. A certain unit of our army in Lanhancun launched a guerrilla attack on the 28th and encountered the Japanese troops in Zhangdian. They were defeated by our army. At present, all the troops of our army in Zhongtiao Mountain have fully demonstrated the tactics of mobility.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report from Xingji on the 30th] More than a thousand Japanese troops from Quandiandian on the Baijin Highway launched an offensive on the morning of the 25th, divided into three groups. One group of about two hundred advanced to Niujiashan (west of Quandian, one mile) via Wangcun, one group of about two hundred attacked Changjiacun (fifteen miles west of Quandian), and one group of more than five hundred attacked Laoniu (ten miles southwest of Quandiandian). Our army divided into groups to meet them head-on, and the left and middle routes have already been completely defeated and fled to Maijiazhuang, five miles west of Zoumazhuang. They are currently being pursued by the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report from Xingji on the 30th] The Japanese troops who occupied Hongzidian Bailing in the northwest of Pingshan, western Hebei, launched an offensive westward in separate routes. They captured Xiaojue and Xiakou on the 20th. The Japanese troops in Shangshezhen (north of Meng County, eastern Jin) advanced eastward via Chelu. They have now merged with the Japanese troops in Xiaojue and Xiakou, totaling about 2,500. In recent days, there have been more than a dozen Japanese planes reconnoitering and bombing between Xiaojue and Bailing, attempting to launch a large-scale offensive westward. They are currently engaged in a fierce battle with a certain detachment of our army in the Xiaojue Tianli area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report from Boluo on the 30th] A certain powerful guerrilla detachment of our army encountered a part of the Inada Inaba Division on the night of the 29th near Shimiya, north of Dayun Mountain, southeast of Yue. After being surrounded by our troops for about two hours, the Japanese troops retreated north. Our troops captured thirteen Japanese rifles, two steel helmets, and killed more than twenty Japanese troops.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Under Our Guerrilla Control: The Lu Bureau Constrained to a Corner; Qingdao's Japanese Textile Factories Still Unable to Recover; Many Puppet County Heads Claim Illness and Dare Not Take Office <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shanghai] The Shanghai English-language newspaper "Great Drop Report" published a detailed dispatch describing the recent situation in Shandong Province. It stated that in the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, when Chinese forces withdrew from Shandong Province, they left as little as possible behind, allowing the Japanese army to occupy it. Factories and industrial enterprises in Qingdao were systematically destroyed, railways were dismantled, and bridges were blown up. However, the Chinese army left behind guerrilla forces. The Japanese army has been fighting these guerrillas in Shandong Province for over a year. Chinese policy is to impose a significant economic burden on the Japanese army whenever possible and to use guerrilla forces to hinder Japanese reconstruction efforts. The following points demonstrate the success of the Chinese policy: (1) The Japanese army has to maintain expensive military defenses throughout the province. (2) The guerrilla forces constantly lure the Japanese army into "pacification" campaigns, consuming even more resources. (3) The Japanese army's power is limited to areas marked by bayonets, while inland economic resources are cut off, preventing the Japanese army from obtaining them. Of Qingdao's 160,000 inhabitants, 23,000 are Japanese, with an increase of 600 each month, as ships sailing from Japan to Qingdao are fully loaded with Japanese people. The destruction of Japanese industries in Qingdao is estimated at 400 million Japanese yen. Although some reconstruction is underway, it is progressing slowly due to a lack of capital in Japan. Although the Japanese army has occupied Qingdao for over a year, the Zhonglong Textile Factory, with losses amounting to 23 million Japanese yen, has yet to resume operations. Qingdao's 1,000 White Russians have been organized by the Japanese army into an anti-communist alliance and used as an "automatic" demonstration parade. The Japanese side claims that the Shandong guerrilla forces are mostly located in the mountains east of Qingdao and southeast of Jinan. However, out of Shandong Province's 107 counties, the puppet provincial government has only appointed county heads for 76 counties, and more than one-third of them are receiving monthly salaries for county heads due to "weak health," yet have not taken office, demonstrating that Chinese forces are also active in that area. According to a certain Japanese army lieutenant general, the Shandong guerrilla forces are equipped with rifles, machine guns, and some field artillery. The lieutenant general also said that the individual courage of the guerrillas is very high. Observers say that the current number of guerrillas is not much different from the number six months ago. In terms of guerrilla activity, the area around Jinan is one of the most troublesome areas for the Japanese army. In the mountains around Jinan, the troops of Navy Admiral Shen Honglie often launch attacks on Japanese garrisons from their bases. On the night of May 16, about 600 Chinese soldiers attacked Japanese garrisons in southeastern Shandong Province. The Japanese garrison in Jinan had to urgently dispatch troops to rescue the attacked Japanese platoon. The Japanese army in Jinan has a strict defense. Chinese entering the railway station are subject to strict searches, and no entry or exit is allowed after 10:00 PM. However, guerrillas often enter the city to trade and occasionally engage in anti-Japanese activities. Several "provincial government" officials have been assassinated in this Japanese-controlled provincial capital of Shandong. Japanese investment in Jinan is not as large as in Qingdao, and most of the establishments are taverns and brothels. Earlier this month, the Japanese army in Shandong Province began attacking the two divisions of Chinese troops and guerrillas numbering over 100,000 between the coast, the Longhai Railway, the Jinpu Railway, and the Jiaoji Railway. The Japanese authorities in Beiping stated that their purpose was to "disperse these anti-Japanese elements" and gain control of cotton and peanut production areas. At the same time, other Chinese forces are attacking south of Yantai, attempting to wipe out the "new order" claimed by the Japanese side. All of this is a general overview of the current situation in Shandong Province.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Returning Triumphantly from Zhongtiao Mountain: Conversation with the Commander-in-Chief of the Henan-Shanxi War Zone; We Choose Advantageous Terrain for a Successful Counterattack; The Enemy's Morale is Exhausted, Showing Signs of Collapse <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Luoyang via the Central News Agency, 30th] The stubbornly resisting [enemy] launched an eighth offensive on Zhongtiao Mountain a week ago, creating an extremely tense situation. A certain commander-in-chief personally crossed over to the front lines to supervise the battle, employing a swift and mobile strategic [approach] to drive out the strong [enemy], conquer Yuanqu, and kill or wound five or six thousand [enemy] troops, once again creating glorious achievements. The certain commander-in-chief returned to a certain place on the evening of the 29th, passing through here, and over two thousand people from all walks of life arrived at the station to welcome him. A reporter from this agency went to a certain place to congratulate this certain person on his victory and to express his gratitude for his hard work. According to this certain person, the victory on Zhongtiao Mountain was due to the commanders using their lives and especially the assistance of the people. The stubbornly resisting [enemy] launched an offensive with 15,000 to 16,000 men, divided into four routes, with the intention of "sweeping away" our strength in one fell swoop. Since our side saw through [the enemy's] conspiracy, we avoided fighting at the "time and place desired" by [the enemy]. We then voluntarily abandoned several strongholds, luring [the enemy] deep into our pre-arranged advantageous areas. In other words, we waited for [the enemy] to fall into our encirclement, and then we launched a full-scale encirclement. Fortunately, the heavy rain and the people's firm policy of clearing the fields disrupted [the enemy's] communication and supply lines, so we were able to defeat the stubbornly resisting [enemy] in one fell swoop. This is certainly a factor in our victory, and the low morale of the [enemy's] combat units was also a reason for our army's victory. According to reports, the panicked state of [the enemy's] forces during this offensive on Zhongtiao Mountain was even worse than before. The [enemy's] officers and soldiers at all levels regarded Zhongtiao Mountain as a fearful path, and they all hesitated to move forward, which led to the [enemy] using machine guns behind the lines to suppress and kill retreating lower-ranking officers, indicating the deepening of the internal crisis of the [enemy]. At this point, the base person also cited the example of Wu Peifu's army, which had previously roamed the country, invincible, until it joined forces with the National Army in Wuhan. At that time, the morale of Wu's army had declined, and senior officers also used machine guns and ammunition behind the lines, but ultimately they could not avoid defeat. Generally speaking, when commanders are fighting, if morale declines, it is a sign of collapse. Finally, the [said] person believes that the [enemy] on Zhongtiao Mountain has suffered a heavy blow, and its elite forces have been exhausted. Now it has reached a point where it is difficult to advance or retreat. If this continues, it is expected that [the enemy] will soon experience a total collapse, and Shanxi, the last shield [of China] in North China, will definitely become more consolidated.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 1st] A Shanghai dispatch reports that the British authorities have announced that the Japanese Navy has agreed to extend the period for blocking the Min River to the 6th to allow British nationals in Fuzhou to evacuate at their leisure. The British Consul in Fuzhou is now advising British women and children to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Local News] Fuzhou expatriate groups here received a telegram from the Fuzhou authorities yesterday, stating that the situation in Fuzhou and Wenzhou is as peaceful as ever and that no fighting has occurred. After occupying Shantou, the [enemy] army declared that it would block the ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou, but this move is impossible because the number of [enemy] ships sent to Fuzhou is small and insufficient to be dispatched. A number of cargo ships recently sailed from Wenzhou to Fuzhou, seeing [enemy] ships cruising in the distance, prohibiting the transport of passengers and goods, until in the afternoon the [enemy] ships suddenly redeployed completely, and the transports were able to enter the port as usual, and traffic was as smooth as ever.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Washington via the Haitong News Agency, 1st] The State Department announced that the US government will protest the bombing of the American United High School in Chuanzhou by Japanese planes. Secretary of State Hull said that the United States will seek compensation for all damaged American property.</p>

<p>[Local News] According to the German-owned Sichen Four Newspaper, yesterday afternoon, [enemy] planes bombed Chongqing, blindly dropping bombs and indiscriminately bombing civilians, causing many fires. Our planes intercepted [the enemy] planes in the air, resulting in the shooting down of several [enemy] planes. Details are still unknown.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Haitong News Agency, 1st] Yesterday, Friday afternoon, after the air raid alarm sounded here, ten million people immediately went to air raid shelters to take refuge, and the order was well maintained. Soon, the streets were empty. When the time came, the all-clear signal was heard. It was reported that 30 Japanese planes attacked Liangshan in three teams, and the losses are unknown. Also, the day before yesterday, 27 Japanese planes wreaked havoc on Fengjie and Yunmo.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] A Shanghai dispatch states that [Zhao] Yong has been running errands for Wang the Traitor, going to Tianjin to discuss with the North China puppet government the matter of organizing a puppet central government. He returned first on the 26th, while Wang the Traitor only returned on the 29th. According to Zhao Xiangren, the North China puppets are still quite distant in their attitude towards Wang the Traitor. Also, Miao Bin met with Wu Peifu on behalf of [Wang the Traitor], but Wu remained unmoved. Wang the Traitor did not mention the previous rumors that he would request to continue using the Qingbai flag at all. Furthermore, the [Enemy] side did not fully agree to the demand to withdraw troops. Wang the Traitor flatters [the Enemy] and, even though he first accepted the intention to train a puppet army of many divisions, allocate them to various places, replace [the Enemy] troops, maintain order in the occupied areas, and gradually go to the front lines to relieve [the Enemy] troops who have been exhausted by prolonged fighting so that they can be transferred back for reorganization, the [Enemy] side has not yet agreed. Therefore, Wang the Traitor's negotiations in North China were of no result at all. At the same time, [Wang's] comrade Hong [Wei] opposed Wang the Traitor very strongly due to conflicts of interest. Wang the Traitor invited [the Traitor] to Shanghai for face-to-face negotiations, but if he does not come, Wang the Traitor is determined to make a trip to Nanjing within days.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Shanghai via Reuters, 1st] The "China Daily" newspaper, sponsored by Wang Jingwei, which ceased publication in August 1937, will resume publication tomorrow. It is reported that Wang Jingwei will personally handle the affairs of the newspaper.</p>
<p>Buying Up Newspapers to Incite People's Hearts</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] A Shanghai dispatch states that the Guide newspaper announced that it would cease publication on July 1 because the publisher, Fei Shi and Bao Na, were bribed with 10,000 yuan by people sent by Wang the Traitor. Therefore, the Guide newspaper suddenly announced its cessation of publication. The cooperation and printing problems of the "English Night Report" are also feared to be difficult to continue, and Fei [Shi] will take over the machinery according to Taiwan's contract, but the authorities are arguing according to Indian precedent. Also, Mr. Fei is scheduled to return to his country by ship on July 10, which is one of the conditions proposed by Wang the Traitor's side. In addition, the Translation Newspaper bribed by Wang the Traitor will also cease publication.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] A Shanghai dispatch states that the China Daily newspaper, run by Wang the Traitor, is planned to be published on July 7th or 8th.

<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>2. Honored Disabled Soldiers</p>
<p>Weren't the vehicles that came with us also carrying a portion of honored disabled soldiers? Seeing the slogan "If the [Enemy] bandits are not eliminated, the warriors are ashamed to enter this gate," they all seemed to have their own feelings. One of them even fell into deep thought for a long time, perhaps silently thinking about the sad affair of "Lofty ambitions unfulfilled, the body falls first, often brings tears to the hero's eyes." Unexpectedly, as the car swerved to avoid a power pole, his left arm, which was resting on the side of the car and forgotten to guard, was unfortunately severed by four fingers. At that time, there were no medical supplies available, only some cotton and a piece of A-shaped handkerchief that a friend gave me were used to wrap his wound, but he shook his head and declined: "I'm afraid of getting the handkerchief dirty!" Honorable and lovable honored warrior! How self-denying and tolerant of pain were you on the front lines? How heroic and sacrificial were you? From this, we have already seen the great spirit!</p>
<p>Since they are all honored disabled soldiers, of course, each has a moving and inspiring history. One tall and thin Shandong man, in the fierce battle of XX, was captured after penetrating deep into the [Enemy]阵. He saw with his own eyes how the [Enemy] used many cruel methods to insult and kill our soldiers and civilians who had lost the ability to resist.</p>
<p>Because he was a skinny man and also had skin diseases like scabies all over his body, the [Enemy] mistakenly thought he had opium and did not kill him, but wanted to use him. But although they did not kill him, they insulted him in every way. Every time they told him to eat leftover soup and scraps, they would not allow him to use chopsticks or hands, but had him crawl on all fours like a dog to eat... Fortunately, he finally escaped from the tiger's mouth, and after many fierce battles, he captured many [Enemy]. Recently, he came to the rear with honor.</p>
<p>Another stout young man with a purple-tan complexion volunteered from Guizhou to Nanchang, which had not yet fallen at that time, to take the aviation exam, but he failed. He then enlisted in the army and fought in various places north of the Yangtze River until his leg was severely injured. He still wanted to fight desperately on the front line, but [his superiors] gave him four yuan in legal tender and insisted that he crawl back on his own. Later, he slowly crawled down. How was he carried to the hospital by the stretcher team in the middle of the journey? How did he lose a leg after waking up from a nap? He didn't know anything. Later, he was transferred here, and people warmly received him along the way. Some even gave him a commemorative badge of "National Hero," which made him too happy. He said that he has now become so fat, and he wants to find a way to fight the [Enemy] happily again. He will not give up!</p>
<p>They also said: Wounded soldiers have already completed the procedures to remove one hand or one leg to verify them as first-class disabled; if the right eye is injured, or the hands and feet are not flexible, it is second-class disabled; if the left eye is injured, it is third-class disabled. The salaries for each class of disabled are fully paid until the end of their lives. If they wish to return home for recuperation, they can be issued travel expenses of more than sixty yuan. After the war ends, first-class disabled can receive a pension of 200 yuan per year, second-class 100 yuan, and third-class 70-80 yuan. But they do not hope to sit idly and eat, they want to engage in production work as much as possible in a safer place, and they must work hard to eliminate the [Enemy] people as they did on the front line!</p>
<p>Bao City is more than forty miles away from Manchuria, and the places passed are all fertile fields. While the honored warriors were talking loudly, the car had already arrived at Hanzhong City, which is prone to causing nostalgic thoughts.</p>
<p>3. Nanzheng Under Various Lights</p>
<p>Although Hanzhong City is named after Emperor Zhaolie becoming the King of Hanzhong, the actual hometown of the King of Hanzhong is Jiuzhoupu in the east of Mian County (more than a hundred miles away from Nanzheng, with an old fort that has been washed away and is unusable), not the current Nanzheng County seat. However, in terms of wide terrain, abundant products, convenient transportation, and higher cultural level, it is worthy to call Nanzheng the representative county of the Shaanxi-South Hanzhong area.</p>
<p>The main streets in the city are still quite wide and clean, but unfortunately, there are few trees planted on the roadside. Although [Enemy] planes have bombed here twice, the increasing number of regular entrances, the prosperity of the market, and the successive construction of new shops have not been affected. The Northwest United University and other schools have relocated a part of them here; there was a small lithographic newspaper here, and recently the Xijing Daily has also published a Hanzhong version, which can add color to the cultural cause of Hanzhong.</p>
<p>The clothes, conversational tone, and lifestyle of the people are all very Sichuan-flavored. On the first night the reporter arrived, he went to the bathhouse to take a bath, and the attendant refused to accept the tip, which is a kind of beautiful custom that is not found in Sichuan and Shaanxi. Only Houjie and Dongguan are more lively at night. When I went there, I saw that the lamps used by the shops for business were electricity, gas, foreign candles, and oil fire, each throwing their own light, which was very inconsistent. Some even had no lights, and they had to grope forward, but the sound of children singing anti-Japanese songs could help break through the layers of darkness. The two places with great light were two cinemas; one screened "Soviet Union Expelling [Enemy] Report", and the audience was extremely crowded; one screened "Kanto Swordsman", and there were few customers. Then, when I walked to the East Gate, I saw another place emitting strange lights, but when I went closer to look, it was very disappointing: it was a superstitious act of doing salvation for the dead. At that time, the wheel of dharma had not yet turned greatly. Five or six red-eyed and yellow-skinned Taoist priests were talking and picking lice in front of the brightly lit spirit tablet, shamelessly.</p>
<p>Some self-proclaimed "people of the Ge Clan without [the] Clan" saints and sages, no, "[idle] people" and layabouts, despite the extremely tense situation, they always lie in the teahouse all day long, sipping tea as usual. There are storytellers in the teahouse, self-playing and self-singing. The content of the former is nothing more than "Emperor Qianlong's Visit to Jiangnan," and the latter is nothing more than "Consort Yang Intoxicated." In addition, it also attracts a group of poor young people, standing on the road listening attentively. There are also two theaters that perform Qin Opera and Peking Opera, and the advertisements also show that they are mostly performing stale and low-interest dramas. If we don't find a way to thoroughly change this style, I don't know how many more idle people and layabouts will be created in the future!</p>
<p>Returning to the hotel, the inspector of the gendarmerie was lecturing a traveler in a neighboring room; he said in a Changsha accent: "You must know that regarding this type of books, even in our military, only officers of general rank are allowed to read them for reference; as for officers below the rank of school officer, they are all prohibited from reading them. You are here from Chengdu to study, how can you buy this type of books to read? What's more, you said that the bookstore sells them openly, and that it's just for research purposes. If I take you to the headquarters, you'll be free in at least four months!"</p>
<p>"That guest is also asking for trouble," the waiter said softly as he opened the door. "Who told him to buy Japanese [Enemy] books at this time!"</p>
<p>As a result, only the book was confiscated, and the accountant was instructed to send it to the headquarters tomorrow for review. It was not the Japanese [Enemy] book that the waiter said casually! (End)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Twenty German Planes Soar Over Danzig; It is Rumored That There Will Be an Incident This Weekend; Poland is Watching the Development of the Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Paris via Reuters, 1st] It is widely rumored in London and Paris that there will be an incident in Danzig at the end of this week, but here it is still not possible to officially confirm this rumor.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Paris via Reuters, 1st] The newspapers here today discussed the recent developments in the situation in Danzig, especially pointing out that the main hope for peace lies in the firm attitude of the democratic countries. "Le Figaro" said, "The Danzig senators are considering the importance of their responsibilities. If the Germans demand the rights of Danzig, then our reply contains only one word, which is 'Czechoslovakia'." "Paris Soir" said, "Unless we have lost control and are led by a love of useless danger, the Axis countries will no longer doubt our determination."</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Berlin via Reuters, 30th of June] This afternoon, people in foreign political circles here are discussing the rumor that Hitler plans to go to Danzig on July 20th. The German government refused to deny this rumor, only saying that they have absolutely no reason to believe it is true. They believe that Hitler would not make such detailed arrangements so long in advance. However, the rumor suggests that other Nazi Party officials, including General Goering, may go there earlier before Hitler goes to Danzig. It is also rumored that if German government officials go to Danzig in the future, they will not notify the Polish authorities in advance as usual. However, it is said that Danzig seems to have heard nothing about the above rumors at this time. Officials and the press have not shown any disturbance about the situation.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Danzig via Reuters, 30th of June] Today, twenty German planes flew to East Prussia. When passing through Danzig, they circled over Danzig. A team of German plainclothes officers has arrived here by special express train to take over the Advance Corps. These Advance Corps have been renamed "Fatherland Army" and have been patrolling the streets. At this moment, the number of Germans infiltrating is greater than the number of Poles there, but National Socialist Party members are sincerely afraid that Poland will adopt German tactics and launch a preemptive strike. This may be a word of nervous tension. Although people in Danzig witnessed German planes flying over, they also knew that Polish artillery teams were practicing in the city and that various military preparations were being carried out outside the border. Dr. Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, has not made any statement, but has recognized that the situation is serious.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Warsaw via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] Political circles here attach great importance to the development of the situation in Danzig and say that the various military measures taken by the Danzig authorities are clearly intended to use psychological pressure to make Poland mobilize its economic and spiritual strength in order to destroy its resistance. At this moment, although Poland remains calm, it will definitely respond to any provocative actions with appropriate means. British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech the day before yesterday was the last warning to Germany. In short, any attempt to change the status of the Free City of Danzig, no matter whether it comes from outside or from within, must be regarded as a cause of war. This is the same in Britain as it is in Poland.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from London via Reuters, 30th of June] British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Kennard, returned to London by plane today. It is said that his trip is to return home for vacation and that there is no special mission.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Paris via Reuters, 30th of June] The French Ambassador to Poland recently returned home for a trip. French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with him today.</p>
<p>Polish Newspapers Expose German Conspiracy</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Warsaw via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] German Socialist Party in Danzig The Free City's organization of a volunteer corps has recently been revealed by various newspapers here. It is said that yesterday four cannons were transported by waterway to Danzig City, pulled by thirty-two horses to Boskov Mountain, and immediately prohibited anyone from climbing the mountain. In addition, the municipal authorities hired 3,000 workers to rush to build barracks for the volunteers to station in. All of these members are German youths, aged between nineteen and twenty, coming from the province of East Prussia. The municipal authorities have recently ordered 4,000 sets of uniforms and 4,000 pairs of leather boots from clothing stores and shoe stores within the territory. The required wool and leather are all supplied by the National Socialist Party. The Warsaw Evening News reported that the German side now has two paths to follow, one is violent action, and the other is to threaten with war. The latter is the most imminent, but it is sufficient to cause a crisis. As for the authorities of the Free City of Danzig, they are also preparing for the mobilization of residents. One point of attention in the occurrence of various phenomena is that all preparations made by Germany before taking violent actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia were extremely secret, but now in Danzig they are not hidden. Therefore, it can be inferred that this is also a tactic, to make Poland restless, so that Germany can choose an opportunity to take provocative actions in a short period of time. The result of this will make the scope of involvement even wider than before, which is not yet certain, and so on.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Paris via the Central News Agency, 29th of June] The Danzig City issue has become more acute. Sources here said that Germany is now planning to resolve it in a short period of time, but still hopes to settle it without war through a policy of intimidation. In general, Germany will choose one of the following measures: (1) Using the existence of the disguised German troops in Danzig City to carry out threats, and having the City Council announce a merger with Germany. Regarding this level, Poland will definitely regard this action as an act of aggression and resist it because its access to the sea will be seriously threatened. If so, France will immediately aid Poland, there is no doubt. (2) Germany may seek to hold talks with Poland, attempting to establish a peaceful settlement plan. Regarding this level, the Free City of Danzig still has the necessity to maintain a demilitarized state.</p>

<p>Su Dongpo was clearly different from Han Yu of the Changli School; he particularly liked to associate with monks and Taoists.</p>
<p>One day, Great Su went to visit a large temple again. The large and small Buddhas in the temple, seeing the great benefactor and talented scholar arrive, all formed a welcoming party to greet him. Only one senior monk sat proudly in the temple, completely ignoring him. Great Su was quite displeased. He went up and asked the reason. The monk said:</p>
<p>"Great Benefactor surely knows that the Buddha said: form is emptiness, emptiness is form. This is called: welcoming is not welcoming, not welcoming is welcoming."</p>
<p>Great Su immediately went over and knocked three times on his bald head, "Dong, dong, dong!"</p>
<p>"Does the Venerable Monk know? This is called: hitting is not hitting, not hitting is hitting."</p>

<p>— By Captain Launton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous Summary: In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Qiukes Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, took a trip to Europe on the German ship "Käpleronqi." On board, they received news that England and Germany had declared war and that British warships were going to intercept the ship. The ship frantically fled. Soon after, they encountered icebergs and were bombarded by British warships. They barely escaped and returned to the American waters of the White Sea. Jack and Bill then returned to New York to see Mr. Qiukes. Qiukes asked them to go to Europe on the "Saint Uke" to find his son.</p>
<p>"That's right, but I don't think that's his name. There's another name. Ah, never mind, what's the use of remembering it – anyway, Mr. Johnson has a bad temper. Just now, when you rejected his letter, I think half of him exploded."</p>
<p>The criticism of this temperamental passenger was suddenly interrupted because a voice burst into Jack's ear. At that moment, one earpiece of the headset was not properly placed. He quickly adjusted it, then gave Bill a toothy smile.</p>
<p>"That's our old friend, the 'Bovik'," he said. "She's waiting for us outside, but this time, don't worry, we're flying the American flag."</p>
<p>The "Saint Mark" stopped on the Atlantic Ocean. The cruiser gradually approached. If this had been on the "Käleronqi," it would have been a thrilling scene.</p>
<p>"Looks like we have a good relationship with her, don't we?" Jack said as they watched the "Bovik" approach, about five hundred yards away.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for that heavy fog, the relationship would probably be even closer," Bill laughed. "Look, they're launching a small boat."</p>
<p>A small boat was lowered from the side of the cruiser, filled with soldiers in full uniform. At the stern sat a spirited junior officer. A row of oars rhythmically struck the water. The "Saint Mark" hurriedly lowered a small ladder. Before long, the young British officer boarded the big ship.</p>
<p>In the first-class lounge, the passengers stood in a line, answering questions about their nationality. They passed through without any difficulty. Then to second class, and finally to steerage. In second class, two German reservists were taken away as prisoners. In steerage, there were as many as six. They seemed not to mind being arrested, even though they knew that this arrest would mean being imprisoned in Halifax or the Bermuda Islands until the end of the war.</p>
<p>Jack and Bill watched with great interest.</p>
<p>"I guess it will be several months, or even years, before these poor devils can see their homes again," Bill said.</p>
<p>"Yes, but you could also say they are the lucky ones in wartime," Jack sighed endlessly.</p>
<p>The inspection work proceeded quickly. An hour later, the prisoners were taken away, and everything was cleared. The two ships saluted each other and separated. The "Bovik" continued her patrol work, and the "Saint Mark" continued her voyage.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Shanghai) Shanghai's prices, normally closely linked to those in other parts of the country, are usually a focal point of concern due to Shanghai's role as a national commercial center and a major hub for import and export goods. However, post-war Shanghai prices have been subject to abnormal increases due to imbalances in supply and demand, coupled with government control of foreign exchange leading to drastic fluctuations in the black market, significantly impacting the livelihood of citizens. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Alarming Price Increases</p>
<p>After the war, agricultural products, industrial products, and mineral products have generally trended upwards. (1) Agricultural products with increases of over 100% include tea, gallnuts, and tobacco leaves. Those with increases of over 50% include tung oil, red sorghum, raw silk, timber, and corn. Those with increases of over 30% include cotton, peanut oil, sesame, and yellow cattle hide. Those with increases of less than 26% include Saigon rice, white rice, wheat, soybeans, dried cocoons, pig lard, table salt, and crude oil. (2) Industrial products such as flour, cotton yarn, cloth, silk, paper, hardware, cement, paints, and chemical raw materials have all trended upwards. In particular, imported paints, chemical raw materials, hardware, and newsprint have seen the most significant increases. Cotton yarn and cloth have also risen sharply, due to factors such as increased overseas shipping costs and the tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, leading to higher costs. (3) Mineral products with widespread and relatively important applications, such as coal, mineral oil, copper, iron, tin, lead, and antimony, have all risen in price. Coal has increased by over 100%, as it is an essential commodity for both industry and daily household use. Oil prices have skyrocketed due to the tightening of foreign exchange in the black market. Other mineral products have also risen in price by approximately 30% to 50% due to transportation constraints.</p>
<p>Merchants Manipulating and Threatening Civilians</p>
<p>Since the 7th of this month, the Shanghai black market exchange rate has decreased from 8.25 pence to 6.5 pence due to adjustments made by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and restrictions on supply by HSBC and other banks. The cost of imported goods has increased sharply, leading to widespread price increases. These include enamelware, leather goods, thermos flasks, paints, briquettes, iron wire, glass, paint, tin foil, Western medicine, cosmetics, rubber, soap, nails, beer, taxis, foreign paper, woolens, cloth, yarn, cigarettes, ink, hardware, machinery, coal, and petroleum wax. However, raw silk, domestic rice, miscellaneous grains, and domestic food products, which are not directly related to foreign exchange restrictions, have also seen price increases. It is undeniable that some speculative merchants are attempting to manipulate prices for huge profits. In particular, the increase in the price of domestic rice is not far from the price in the winter of 1937, when the war first broke out. Current rice stocks in Shanghai are considered sufficient, and there is no legitimate reason for such a rapid rise. This is clearly due to manipulation by speculative merchants. If measures are not taken to prevent this, it will inevitably have a significant impact on the livelihood of the population.</p>
<p>Widespread Hope for Price Stabilization</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the prices of daily necessities in various regions and to crack down on speculation and manipulation, the National Government has promulgated the "Methods for Assessing Prices and Cracking Down on Speculation and Manipulation during Extraordinary Times." Price stabilization committees are to be established by relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, and trade associations dealing in daily necessities in various regions to manage local price stabilization. Price stabilization committees have now been established in all major cities. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. If a price stabilization committee were to be established, there would be many difficulties in implementing crackdowns. Although some hope that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, together with various trade associations, will be responsible for assessing the prices of daily necessities and cracking down on speculative manipulation, various trade associations believe that this is practically difficult. However, with regard to the soaring prices in the concessions, it is hoped that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession will carefully consider and address this issue. Special attention should be paid to the selling prices of industries related to the people's livelihood, in order to avoid impacting the livelihood of citizens.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Classmates <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>The union between people based on blood relation results in "same surname," and that based on geographical relation results in "same hometown." Both are undoubtedly beneficial. In addition, the union based on background results in "classmates," which seems to have some benefits as well. I cannot help but devote some ink to praise it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we heard that "a certain major" [classmates from a certain university] controlled education in a certain province, and thus the education sector of that province became "the alumni association of that university." On a slightly smaller scale, the faculty and staff of a certain school were all classmates from a certain university, and thus that school also became "the alumni association of that university." Similarly, we also heard that the judicial officials of a certain province were all classmates from a certain law and political science school, and thus the judicial sector of that province became "the alumni association of that law school"; or that they were all classmates who had studied in a certain country, and thus became "the alumni association of those who studied in that country"… Once one becomes a classmate, one's prestige increases tenfold, and one's job security is guaranteed, allowing one to enjoy endless benefits. This is the so-called benefit of being classmates.</p>
<p>Since it is an "alumni association," naturally "non-classmates" can only be squeezed out and cannot get a foothold. These "non-classmates" are naturally resentful and angry. However, I think for their sake, there is no need to be so resentful. Who doesn't have classmates? Why not create a few "alumni associations" of your own to play with, instead of relying on others or trying to share their spoils? As long as you can organize your own group tightly and have the ability to do so, throughout history, people have been allowed to create pure groups and exclude dissidents. There is no need to be polite! By creating your own alumni association, you can also sit back and enjoy the benefits.</p>
<p>Originally, all classmates are bound to be very loyal and will do their best to help each other. For example, take Sun Bin and Pang Juan of ancient times. I believe they were both true to their friendship as classmates, because without Pang Juan, Sun Bin would not have had his kneecaps removed, achieving eternal fame and becoming a great man. And without Sun Bin, Pang Juan would not have been shot to death in the Ma Ling Road, leaving a notorious legacy and also becoming a great man! -- A great man should either achieve eternal fame or leave a notorious legacy. By analogy, therefore, their later classmates Su Qin and Zhang Yi, although generally speaking, seemed to have different views and their relationship was not considered very good, they complemented each other, one advocating alliance and the other advocating vertical alliance, achieving the same goal through different paths, and both achieving the position of ministers. The four of them, in the six states, thus formed a small "Guida (Ghost Valley University) alumni association," which can truly be compared to the modern "certain university alumni association."</p>
<p>Another example is Guan Ning and Hua Xin. Although they ended up "severing their mats," I believe they still lived up to their status as classmates, because it was Guan Ning who inspired Hua Xin to make achievements and even participate in the great event of "forcing the abdication of the emperor," and wasn't it also Hua Xin who shaped Guan Ning's noble deeds of not serving kings and nobles? This is also a case of opposites complementing each other, each with its own merits.</p>
<p>To take current events as an example, we often hear that a certain classmate from a certain school does not engage in proper business and specializes in borrowing money from other classmates. The alumni association specifically issues a notice, urging everyone not to be deceived. A certain student from a certain school has committed a disreputable criminal case and is being held in jail. The alumni association hastily publishes a statement in the newspaper denying that they have such a classmate... In all such cases, I still believe that classmates are very loyal and willing to help each other, because in this way, it is enough to make the mean man honest and the cowardly man ambitious. They are inheriting the consistent style of the "Guida alumni association." As for adding a bowl of rice to the classmate who is beneficial to oneself, that is of course the proper thing to do and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The virtuous policies of the alumni association are truly so beautiful that they cannot be described, and they truly make me resolve to remain silent after praising them. But there are things that are as beautiful as alumni associations, or perhaps even more beautiful, and I cannot help but write about them in connection, otherwise I will always feel that my views are not broad enough.</p>
<p>This is what is called "same mountain gate," abbreviated as "same mountain" or "same production." It is well known that "same mountain" can help one bargain and fight, but if one wants to achieve great things, if you are the "big brother," you must have many "virtuous brothers" from the "same mountain" to help you. Zhao Kuangyin, Zhu Yuanzhang, and the like were able to ascend to the throne thanks to this. Nowadays, this trend is gradually flowing into the scholar-official class, and it has a tendency to replace the "alumni association." Perhaps the alumni association will even be eliminated!</p>
<p>However, before the "alumni association" is eliminated, I always envy "classmates who are young and not lowly, ride fat horses in light furs." I wish I could insert myself into every such "alumni association"!</p>
<h3 id="e19">Riverside <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Saifu</p>
<p>Gently descending the steps one by one, we saw the river water in a torrent: mist, permeating the surface of the water… many ragged people, yellow-faced and emaciated, carrying two wooden buckets, descending one step at a time, all the way to the river surface, then picking up two full buckets of water, so heavy.</p>
<p>The water at the riverside is so turbid. But without it, people cannot live. Along the riverside, the cooking smoke drifting out from those dense, dilapidated houses, combined with the silver mist.</p>
<p>The streets along the riverside are mostly muddy, never drying all day.</p>
<p>Oh, this is just the spring stream.</p>
<p>In the summer, when the snow in the mountains melts, it rushes down like a waterfall, all the way into the river, and the river water rises day and night.</p>
<p>An old man said to us: "The summers here are often marked by floods."</p>
<p>When we asked him if he knew about the Japanese bombings, the expression on his face immediately became tense. He pointed to a dilapidated opening in the rear wing on the right.</p>
<p>"It was there that the Japanese planes dropped a dozen bombs, killing more than sixty people…"</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid?" one of us asked him.</p>
<p>"What is there to be afraid of? It is what it is. We can only fight to the end!</p>
<p>"Even a three-year-old child understands that." He said with a pair of moist eyes, the clothes in his hand were dirty, he placed them on a stone, and struck them incessantly with a wooden stick.</p>
<p>An old man squatting by the river washing clothes is quite rare in the countryside. – I can say that it was the first time I had ever seen it.</p>
<p>"Why are you washing clothes yourself?"</p>
<p>"There's no one… my son went to the army. He wrote in a letter that they are working really hard… My daughter-in-law… my daughter-in-law was killed in that bombing, and two grandchildren also died…"</p>
<p>He seemed to be trembling as he spoke. The pale whiskers under his sausage-like nose trembled slightly with his rapid breathing.</p>
<p>"... Sir, I will be leaving soon, to farm in the mountains... I think that in war, grain is also important. I have a younger brother in the mountains…"</p>
<p>"What kind of work do you do here?"</p>
<p>"Me? I shred tobacco…" As he spoke, he dipped the clothes into the water again, and immediately lifted them up again, without even wringing them out, he carried them away wet, looking very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We waited for a small sailboat because we had to cross the river. The small sailboat moved very slowly, and it took a long time to come alongside the stone steps. The fellow punting the boat jumped from the boat onto the stone steps via a plank.</p>
<p>The mist still floats on the surface of the river. The water at the riverside is so turbid, the fellow punting the boat is very skillful in pulling the sails.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Sketches of Living People <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Duanyuan</p>
<p>This is a dark age of massacres. There's nothing to say. When the fighting just started, many cities were being bombed on a large scale. The city I arrived at was calmly buried between mountains and rivers, so serene for a year and a half, untouched by barbaric hands. I felt a little joy.</p>
<p>Then came a day of tragic killing. Modern warfare encompasses the vast rear areas, and a county town with a dense population often becomes an ideal target for bombing. Slaughter is distributed as evenly as sunlight to everyone, allowing no personal choice.</p>
<p>The newly made siren emitted a dull, lingering sound, a sound that was both gloomy and mournful. Pushing open the window, it rushed in like a rapidly broadcasted sixty-fourth note, the *di di* sounds echoing. The curtains were rolled up and then lowered again.</p>
<p>I thought I should go to the suburbs. It's an instinct for self-preservation. A bomb drops, destroying houses and people, even though the slaughter is distributed as evenly as sunlight to everyone, allowing no private choice.</p>
<p>On the street, carriages and horses as thick as water blocked the way. On the bluestone road, vehicles trailed past one after another. People fled from their houses, and seeing the panicked crowds, they also became agitated. One hand clutched the money in their pocket, the other pressed down on the hat on their head, rushing into the crowd. Mothers with children covered the mouths of their crying children with their palms. Young wives carried their mothers-in-law on their backs between overlapping backs, tentatively moving forward with shaky steps. An old woman who witnessed a massacre decades ago, her eyes dim, didn't forget the large string of sandalwood prayer beads in her hand. Although she had never experienced the true horror of the massacre in this era, she chanted Zen phrases.</p>
<p>A young woman suddenly fainted and fell on me. I reached out, purely by accident, and touched her chest. I recoiled. Then, she stood up in such embarrassment, and we hurriedly went our separate ways.</p>
<p>Time slipped backward with silent footsteps.</p>
<p>I came to the outskirts of this city. People had already exhausted their ingenuity behind earthen mounds and under bridge piers, calculating angles, light, and shadow, trying to minimize reflections into the sky. A subtle but tense sound of roaring airplanes was in my hearing, recounting and intimating like a repeated memory that another massacre was lurking. I found a trench without a cover and walked into it.</p>
<p>The narrow trench was already crowded with several people. Yes, there was nothing to say. Everyone seemed immersed in bitter thought, not even exchanging glances. I could only stand in the narrow ditch, discovering the fragile soul of a living person unintentionally. He came in, shivering, and stood behind me, nudging me with his elbow.</p>
<p>I turned my face to look at him, and almost simultaneously, I stared. A fat body, a bald forehead, wearing a neat silk-padded robe, and a heavy watch chain hanging from the pocket of his black mandarin jacket. I stared, the round, plump face having lost its original rosiness, gradually revealing traces of cyanosis from the ashen color.</p>
<p>The planes formed nine tight black dots in the distant sky.</p>
<p>Such a noble man, he had a heavy watch chain, he had money. Just the heavy watch chain alone told me that he should be timid, he should always preserve his life to enjoy his life. But the planes drew closer, the loud engine making people afraid. I saw him squat down, despicably squatting at my feet. For once, I felt proud that I was sheltering a life, a fragile life trembling at my feet, trembling more violently as the engine sound grew louder. But I still felt that I couldn't put his mind at ease. He might still think that hiding at my feet wasn't safe enough. Of course, the best thing would be if he could shrink, if the fat man could shrink to the size of a small bead, and I could bend down to pick up this small bead and put it in my pocket while the planes circled overhead. This shouldn't be too indecent. When the engine sound faded away, I would take the small bead out of my pocket again, let her turn back into a fat man, still rich, with his heavy watch chain, and return to the city. He would still be a happy man, stretching his waist and living his wealthy life.</p>
<p>The sound of the first bomb roared, and at the same time, the first anti-aircraft gun fired. The nine light bombers scattered in the sky, scattering as if the number of planes had increased. This was a little terrifying, right? Machine gun bullets also started to fire down from the planes. The fragile life squatting at my feet trembled again. I saw him lowering his head, burying his face deeply in his hands. Yes, if there was another small trench connected to this ditch, he would definitely spread his limbs and quietly crawl into it.</p>
<p>A continuous cough rose from the other end of the trench, like the cough of someone with pulmonary tuberculosis. I felt someone's shoulder bump against my leg. Looking down, the living person had raised his face and said pleadingly.</p>
<p>"Sir, please ask him not to cough."</p>
<p>What I heard was a trembling voice, low, but earnest. A person should have the right to cough, I was silent.</p>
<p>Finally, he stood up halfway, craned his neck a little, and said in a scolding voice:</p>
<p>"Hey! Keep quiet."</p>
<p>The cough couldn't be suppressed and came up again, seemingly even more severe.</p>
<p>"Do you want to die? The plane is overhead, and you're coughing on the ground."</p>
<p>"What if I cough?"</p>
<p>"If the plane hears, can you guarantee you can afford a bomb?"</p>
<p>These words provoked a burst of unrestrained laughter, but the third person immediately interjected, as if changing the atmosphere at that moment.</p>
<p>"Chinese people are sacrificing themselves by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, who guarantees it?"</p>
<p>"Okay, you're cursing people, fuck you..."</p>
<p>A plane aimed a heavy bomb at a residential area within a hundred yards. The power of the bomb changed the air pressure, and the clods of earth in the ditch trembled and fell. The bomb interrupted that arrogant speech.</p>
<p>"You should take off the watch chain, the watch chain will reflect light."</p>
<p>I saw a fat and white hand raised, quietly removing the seemingly heavy watch chain.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Plunging Towards the Motherland <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>—A Story of a Girl—</p>
<p>So she left, along with several colleagues. It was on a clear afternoon that they boarded the train at the station across the sea.</p>
<p>There were many people in the third-class carriage, but she couldn't understand their language. Similarly, they wouldn't understand her language either. It was said that it would only take three hours by train to reach the destination, so she calculated in her mind how to arrange accommodation, have dinner, and it wouldn't be dark yet.</p>
<p>The wheels rolled powerfully on the tracks, making noise as if uneven. Her mood was like a blank piece of paper covered with road maps. She remembered that in the past, she had also sat on a train leaving her residence, walking a heavy, step-by-step path: returning to her residence, with a gradually lighter and more joyful heart. Now she had nothing. Although she tried to restrain her useless thoughts of home from time to time, there was always an unusual feeling in her heart. She lost her personal trivial joys and sorrows. Her heart, like the hearts of many young people, beat sincerely for the revival of the entire nation. Sometimes it seemed indifferent, but in essence, it earnestly looked forward to that anticipated immense gratification.</p>
<p>It seemed that after traveling a third of the way, they crossed the boundary of the concession. In the areas under their own governance, some were naturally insufficiently developed, and some obviously left behind the remnants of destruction by the enemy. The people in the carriage pointed and spoke to their companions through the glass, but she couldn't understand anything. She could only observe from their expressions, knowing that their hearts were filled with indignation.</p>
<p>Qingzhi pondered to herself as she walked. She remembered that since the beginning of the war, although she had done some work, she had not had the direct experience of escaping the massacre. In the newspapers, she saw enemy planes bomb and kill countless innocent people. Even within that deformed concession, she would painfully watch enemy planes flying low in groups of three or five, dropping bombs. But those bombs would not fall into the concession, so those merchants, young ladies from wealthy families, rich young men, along with herself, could still survive without losing a hair, living in peaceful times. How could such a life be worthy of the brothers who shed their blood on the land to defend the country? (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Local Overseas Chinese Schools Registered Domestically Will Implement Spiritual Mobilization Education; Outlines to be Drafted Soon and Promoted by Overseas Chinese Education Associations to Strengthen Students' Understanding and Beliefs <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The National Spiritual Mobilization Plan, resolved and passed by the National Political Council of Representatives last year, and announced by the supreme leader to the whole country for conscientious implementation, has led to overseas Chinese at home and abroad rising to swear allegiance to its implementation. The aim is to make the general public aware of the principles of the nation first, the ethnicity first, military affairs first, victory first, contributing money if you have money, and contributing strength if you have strength, and to strengthen the understanding and belief in the War of Resistance. The overseas Chinese in Hong Kong who have sworn allegiance to the spiritual mobilization have sprung up like a whirlwind and held ceremonies separately. It is heard that the overseas Chinese schools registered domestically, in order to give overseas Chinese a deep belief and practice of national spiritual mobilization, intend to implement spiritual mobilization education. Because each student is for the future construction of China, the need for direct indoctrination is important, but indirect indoctrination is even more sufficient to popularize it among the general overseas Chinese. Therefore, they have identified the implementation of spiritual mobilization education as a key element of wartime education. The implementation method is to use the morning and evening or memorial week assemblies in the school, or class meetings, parent-teacher meetings, etc., to make students practice spiritual mobilization in various ways. On the other hand, they will use the teaching materials in the curriculum to instill the meaning of mobilization, and will create an implementation outline for spiritual mobilization education and ask the overseas Chinese education associations to promote it.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Ford Cars Sell Well; Exports Improve Year After Year; Many Advantages; Equipment Mostly Unavailable in Other Cars <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Ford Motor Company, the best and most reliable of its products should be the 1939 Ford car and the Mercury engine. The appearance is quite similar to an 85-horsepower engine, but it is not. It can actually generate 10 more horsepower, and the number of revolutions per minute is reduced by 200 (that is, 3,600 revolutions per minute instead of 3,800). It can also generate greater drag or pulling force, reaching 13 percent, and the number of revolutions per minute is 100 less than the 85-horsepower engine. As for its weight, including the transmission case and the starter, it is only 7 pounds more than the 85-horsepower engine. In terms of horsepower, its weight is actually lighter than any other Ford engine. The pound ratio for the Mercury engine is 6.38, the 60-horsepower engine is 6.75, and the 85-horsepower engine is 7.05. In addition, all Ford Mercury and Lincoln Zephyr cars use baked enamel, which is durable and unparalleled. The Ford has a ventilated Y-shaped windshield, which is not available in other cars. The view is clear because the front edge window is not fitted with metal crossbars to avoid obstructing the driver's view. Other features include curved handles inside and outside the car doors, with no risk of snagging clothes. The top of the front seat back is fitted with soft padding. If a car accident occurs, rear-seat passengers can be protected from injury. There are no protruding handles or controls on the front of the dashboard to ensure safety. The ignition button is mounted on the front of the steering column, so the driver's knees will not touch it. It is also equipped with foot controls to increase or decrease light intensity, and both hands do not need to leave the steering wheel when overtaking other cars and need to reduce the light. In addition, this year's Ford Mercury and Lincoln Zephyr cars are specially equipped with door latches. This simple equipment allows the car doors to open wide for easy entry and exit. All of these are safety features. In addition, there is a special variation. The Ford and Mercury seats are all equipped with flexible compound springs, making them extremely comfortable to ride on. This year's Ford products have all the above advantages. It is appropriate for people in society to purchase Ford cars more enthusiastically than in previous years with sufficient foot controls for headlight beam intensity.</p>

<p>The Lan Ting in Happy Valley is located in a very important location, but no one paid attention to it before. It was abandoned for many years until 1920, when the Tram Company submitted a request to the government to apply for the land to build a repair room, first to allow passengers to avoid sunlight or wind and rain, and second to allow drivers and ticket sellers to rest here for shift changes. Later, it suddenly became a tea room, also selling sweets, biscuits and other foods, with booming business. However, the Lan suddenly moved out completely the day before yesterday, which surprised all sectors. According to people in the store, they told reporters that the government has now recovered the land, so they had to move out.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong shipbuilding industry has been very prosperous in recent years, with many ships being built in Hong Kong. In the past three months, the urgency of shipbuilding work in various shipyards has opened up a phenomenon that has never existed in Hong Kong before. It was found that on the 30th of last month alone, the tonnage of ships under construction in various shipyards reached 29,760 tons, of which two were 10,000-ton giant ships of the Jardine Shipping Company, which were being built in the Taikoo Shipyard. One is about to be completed and is scheduled for launching on the 19th of this month. In the past three months, a total of 3,942 tons of ships have been completed in Hong Kong, of which the Zhen Nazhi, built by the Yuzhen Shipyard, is one of the greatest. There are three ships that have been launched, weighing a total of 732 tons.</p>

<p>Yesterday, from morning to noon, within three hours, two traffic accidents occurred in Hong Kong one after another. A man and a child were injured. The child's injuries were particularly severe. It was found that at 11:30 yesterday morning, a tram with a certain number was traveling from west to east, intending to drive to Shau Kei Wan. When it drove to the vicinity of Gilman Motors, a truck suddenly drove out from the side road and crossed the road. The tram driver saw the situation and immediately applied the brakes and stopped to let the truck pass. After the truck had passed, it continued to drive. A tricycle followed closely behind it, unnoticed by the tram driver, and it crashed into the tricycle. With a loud crash, the car was knocked over, and the driver was thrown off the car, injuring the back of his head on a stone, with blood gushing out and unconscious. After the accident, the driver immediately stopped the car, got out of the car to help, and some passengers from the east side helped the injured person up and sent him to the No. 2 Police Station to report the case. After giving a slight dressing, they immediately called the St. John Ambulance to take him to the Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. The injured person's name is Dong Pei, 21 years old, who lives at a certain number in Hill Village Road and makes a living by animal husbandry. He was driving home yesterday because he sent meat to a certain butcher shop, but he was involved in an accident. Also, at 2:00 in the afternoon of the same day, a car with a certain number was driving along Queen's Road Central, near the China Pharmacy. A child, about ten years old, ran out from the arcade, wanting to cross the road. The driver saw the situation and hurriedly turned off the switch and stopped the car, but it was too late. The child was knocked down, and the wheels ran over his head, his skull was broken, and blood and flesh were blurred, dying. The scene was extremely tragic. Afterwards, the driver of the accident car took him to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. The child's injuries were very serious, and there are fears for his life.</p>

<h3 id="e29">At a Time When Guidance Services Are Flourishing, Female Massage Therapists Have Also Emerged; Fees are Charged by the Hour, Which Is Worth Studying <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>In recent times, the world advocates the equality of men and women. Women's participation in politics and women's occupations are sung to the skies. Among women's occupations, the most common are female workers in restaurants and tea rooms, dance hostesses, and the recently emerged female tourist guides. As to whether the scope of business of female tourist guides matches their name, this newspaper has exhausted its efforts to expose it. Under the name of tourist guides, engaging in multi-faceted "guidance services," such as the so-called "indoor tourist guides," people can understand the meaning by the name alone. A few days ago, the newspaper reported that the general public had started to petition the Chinese representatives to ask the Hong Kong government authorities to ban them. This is the reason why the guidance business has developed rapidly and the public is eager to eliminate it. Now, at a time when the Hong Kong guidance business that leads people to pornography and leads people to the decadent enterprise is still looking down on the world, there are also massage, foot massage, foot scraping, nail trimming, and corn removal services by women. Although their business methods are different from those of female tourist guides, their claim that "on-call service is available at half a dollar per hour" has the same effect as the guidance business. Whether their business scope is really just massage and nail trimming, or also involves other work, is difficult for outsiders to rashly judge. But judging from the half dollar per hour, we know that there must be something fishy. There are formally trained female nail trimmers, but we have never heard of charging by the hour in such a strange way. In short, with the increasing number of such organizations, those who indulge in the sea of ​​erotic desires, tired of calling "tourist guides," will definitely want to try calling "massage girls." The activities of private prostitutes and courtesans, under the temporary prosperity of the guidance business, already have a sense of opening up the rose bushes. It will soon be seen that "massage girls" and "tourist guides" will have another battle between dragons and tigers. But I don't know whether the tourist guides will not be banned by the authorities, and I don't know whether the massage girls will be able to openly engage in business without being banned.</p>

<p>The Women's War Relief Society, in commemoration of the second anniversary of the "July 7" War of Resistance, in addition to holding flag-giving fundraising activities, specially took advantage of the China Salvation Drama Troupe before going abroad and invited them to hold a large-scale charity performance at the Lee Theater for three consecutive nights on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of this month to raise funds for relief work. The "China Salvation" has profound artistry and has long been a sensation in Hong Kong. The first day of the performance yesterday was the national defense drama "The Banks of the Yongding River," which is a masterpiece of the "China Salvation" and national playwrights. It was the first performance in Hong Kong. The drama's purpose was enthusiastic and great. The audience in the full house, in a solemn and tragic atmosphere, applauded warmly, which shows that the troupe's profound artistic cultivation can indeed transfer the audience's emotions. On the evening of the 2nd, they will perform the wonderful drama "Catastrophe of the Land," and on the evening of the 3rd, they will perform "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom." These dramas are all forged from the reality of the War of Resistance and compiled based on practical experience and artistic effects. It is directed by Jinshan, and the entire "China Salvation" participates in the performance. After the troupe finishes performing at the Lee Theater, they will leave Hong Kong for the United States in the near future to carry out the work of arousing the people. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese quickly booked their seats and do not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Hong Kong, in order to connect feelings and promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, have been preparing to organize an Association of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Merchants in Hong Kong.

Although there was a Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce before, its scope was still narrow and not well-suited to the needs of the present era. If this organization could be expanded and the spirit of sincere unity advanced, it is believed that it could certainly grasp the assurance of resisting [unclear symbol] and winning. Mr. Zhu then reported on the past situation of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce. Finally, Wu Zhihao reported on the preparatory process. The discussion of the charter then began.

<p>Pui To Girls' Middle School was originally located in Dongshan, Guangzhou, and has a history of over fifty years. Since the outbreak of the war, due to frequent [unclear character] bombings of Guangzhou, classes could not continue, so the school moved to Kwong Wa Street, Mong Kok, Kowloon. Initially, there was only one school building. Now, due to the continuous increase in students, the school has expanded to two major locations: one at 3-11 Kwong Wa Street and the second at 13-40 Kwong Wa Street. In addition, the elementary school department is located on Shandong Street, Mong Kok. There are currently over 300 high school and junior high school students and over 100 elementary school students. More than half of the high school and junior high school students are boarding students.</p>

Students with excellent grades can be recommended by the school to the above universities, and can obtain various conveniences in the examination procedures. On average, approximately 40 students graduate from the school each year. Among them, in addition to half continuing their studies, the rest mostly transfer to the education field or other professions. In addition, over 20 graduates of this school year have already registered for further studies.</p>
<p>In addition to the gymnasium built by the school itself, the school equipment, including instruments, physics specimens, etc., in addition to those moved from Guangzhou, over 1,000 yuan has been spent to purchase additional equipment for the current semester. There are approximately 3,000 types of books. There are approximately 50 faculty members in the high school, junior high school, and elementary school.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching general middle school textbooks, the school also pays special attention to Chinese, English, and mathematics. It is said that the highest grades in the school each year are especially good in English.</p>
<p>The school is currently recruiting students for all levels of high school, junior high school, and transfer students. For the registration procedure, two half-length photos measuring 2.5 inches are required at the time of registration, along with a registration fee of two yuan, to receive a receipt and an examination permit.</p>
<p>Fees: High school boarding students pay a total of 115.5 yuan, day students pay 60.5 yuan. Junior high boarding students pay 109 yuan, and day students pay 55 yuan. In addition, high school students pay a science experiment fee of 4 yuan per semester, and junior high students pay a science experiment fee of 1.5 yuan. For elementary school, boarding students pay over 90 yuan, and day students pay 42 yuan.</p>
<p>In order to support students from poor families with outstanding talents, the school has specially set up free tuition places for five high school students, six junior high students, and ten elementary school students.

<p>(Qujiang Special News) The Guangdong Provincial Mobilization Committee believes that sanitation personnel should be responsible for rescuing wounded and sick soldiers and civilians during this time of war. However, with the fall of Guangzhou, most sanitation personnel have taken refuge in Hong Kong and Macau, resulting in a lack of medical treatment for wounded and sick soldiers and civilians in the war zones. It is now in the process of persuading sanitation personnel who have moved to Hong Kong and Macau or Guangzhou to return to practice in the mainland and to serve at the front lines to participate in the country's war of resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Today's Tennis Charity Match: Wang and Xu to Perform <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>To be Held at the Chinese Recreation Club at 3 PM This Afternoon</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] A friend who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing once said to me with great emotion, "Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I have been to many places inland, and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in various places I have seen shows that compatriots residing in Hong Kong are the least concerned. Some have simply forgotten their motherland." I wonder if what my friend said is correct. Compatriots in Hong Kong should search their hearts and ask themselves.</p>
<p>I understand that how many people can live in peace while being mindful of danger? Hong Kong is a comfortable haven, and there are many wealthy and leisurely people, so a decadent phenomenon has formed.</p>
<p>However, the general sports community in Hong Kong has in the past done its best to contribute to disaster relief. However, due to environmental constraints, they have not been able to fully express themselves.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Sports Community Wartime Service Corps often has new initiatives for fundraising work. Today, they are holding another tennis charity match, with newly arrived from Chongqing tennis master Wang Wenzheng, Hong Kong's tennis pride Xu Weipei, as well as Xu Jianpei and Xiao Linzhen taking to the court to perform.</p>
<p>Tennis is becoming increasingly aristocratic, and it is believed that this charity match will attract many dignitaries to attend and contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng's skills were honed in Shanghai. In recent years, he has been working in Sichuan and has had few opportunities to compete with good players, so he has not made astonishing progress. He has many masterpieces in his life. Winning the Shanghai Hard Court Singles Championship in 1933 and winning the top spot in tournaments against masters in the Philippines were his most satisfying achievements. Philippine star GVIA, during his most popular era, was twice defeated by Wang. Others such as Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai have also been defeated by Wang. The maturity of his tennis skills can be imagined.</p>
<p>Xu Weipei needs no introduction. His appearance today to compete against Wang almost implicitly suggests to us that this is a major occasion to compete for the number one spot in the country. Of today's three events, this match is the most important and most eye-catching.</p>
<p>The competition will begin at 3 PM at the Chinese Recreation Club in Causeway Bay (next to the Navy Football Field). The program is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Singles</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng vs. Xu Weipei</p>
<p>(2) Mixed Doubles</p>
<p>Diao Zuo [unclear] and Yang Weibin vs. Ling Daoshe and Mrs. Zhao Juncao</p>
<p>(3) Doubles</p>
<p>Xu Weipei and Xu Runpei vs. Wang Wenzheng and Xiao Linzhen</p>
<p>Tickets are available in three denominations: $2, $1, and $0.50. Those who purchase raffle tickets will have the chance to win two Dunlop tennis rackets. Philanthropic patrons are invited to arrive early. (The Tennis Court Deity)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Chinese Baseball Team Defeats Western Team Decisively: Score 15 to 2 <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the Chinese baseball team decisively defeated the Western team with a score of 15 to 2. The huge difference in the score was unexpected. The Western team tied the score at 2 to 2 in the third inning, and the situation was quite tense. However, in the fourth inning, the Chinese team scored three hits, with Rong Jun, Bingfen, Cansen, and Guodong scoring consecutively. In the fifth inning, Zheng Qu caused Cavalio to mistakenly reach base, and the path to hit led Bingfen, Cansen, Guolian, and Chen Fang to return to home base one after another, scoring a total of five points. Afterwards, Lin Ye made a sacrifice hit and was still on base. Zheng Wenjie was struck out after three strikes. Except for Lian Liang, who advanced to first base, at this time Wenjie, seeing that Lian Liang was barefoot, specially gave his shoes to Lian Liang. The umpires Chang Lingjian and Buling said that when Wenjie passed the shoes, he touched first base. According to the rule that two runners touch the base at the same time, Lian Liang should be called out. However, the Chinese team was sure of victory and did not protest. (Note: In this situation, Wenjie has already been called out and is not a runner, so the umpire should not apply the rule that two runners touch the same base.) In the last inning, the Chinese team scored four more points, resulting in a victory of fifteen to two.</p>
<p>Chinese: 0 1 1 4 5 0 4 = 15</p>

<h3 id="e54">Today's Baseball League: Youbie Team to Play South China; South China's Appeal Case Still Not Scheduled for Discussion <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>This morning at 10:00 AM, the public baseball league will feature a match between the Youbie team and the South China Athletic Association. After losing to the Chinese team last Monday, Youbie is even more arrogant. This time, when playing South China, Youbie certainly won't take them seriously, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Since the loss of their star player, South China's resistance has weakened day by day, leading to defeat after defeat. Although pitcher Zheng Kangyong throws with great force, his pitches are monotonous, often exploited by opposing batters. In addition, in the last three innings, he often suffers from a lack of strength, resulting in chaotic technique. This is not the result of not trying hard, but rather a lack of experience. It is hoped that Zheng will respond calmly, use a cool head to take care of each base, and at the same time, examine the batter's stance, pitching to their weaknesses. By using his brain, he will surely improve greatly.</p>
<p>The American warship "Diannu" was originally scheduled to fight the Hong Kong Association today, but because it was ordered to sail to Guangzhou and could not return in time, today's battle is suspended.</p>
<p>During the fierce battle between South China and the Western Association last week, Situ Bi stole to third base. The third base umpire said that Situ had safely reached the base, but umpire Dejilishi, standing behind the pitcher, ruled that Situ was out. South China protested, and the baseball association has not yet held a meeting to discuss who is right and who is wrong. It is still necessary to wait for discussion. The lineups of the two teams today are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Position) Youbie Team South China Team</p>
<p>Pitcher Xia Gaoli Zheng Kangyong</p>
<p>Catcher Wu Yiwen He Xiancheng</p>
<p>First Base Li Anna Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Second Base Susha Tang Rongguang</p>

<h3 id="e55">Wimbledon Men's Singles: Reaching a Critical Juncture; The Final Eight Have Revealed Four <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the Wimbledon Championships. The weather was sunny and the breeze was gentle. There were no unexpected changes in the competition, and the situation became even more heated. The men's singles has gradually reached the final stage, and four players have reached the final eight. (In addition to Austin, Riggs, Corky, and Gugujiezhake, whose fourth-round results are still awaiting tomorrow morning's telegraph, the other four who have already entered the fifth week are Henkel, Pansek, Muhammad, and Smith.) It is unknown whether there will be any surprises afterwards, but it is expected that the ideal candidates for the "final four" will be Austin, Riggs, Henkel, and Pansek.</p>
<p>German number one Henkel defeated French veteran Brunon, one of the four musketeers, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0. Although Brunon's skills were good, his energy was insufficient, so Henkel won easily. This old general no longer had the fierce state of yesterday.</p>
<p>Yugoslavian number one Pansek defeated Argentina's Aixel. Except for the second set, which was more competitive, Pansek always had the upper hand. In the third set, Pansek became more courageous as he fought, and it was even more controlled by him alone. The result was 6-3, 8-6, 6-1.</p>
<p>Thus, Henkel and Pansek have reached the final eight.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching of the day's famous matches was the Indian player Muhammad, who defeated Hungarian Cup player Zigtei in two hours and forty-five minutes and also entered the "final eight." Muhammad has repeatedly performed well in Europe this year. He also shone brightly in the Queen's Club competition before Wimbledon, where he reached the final. Now he has repeatedly defeated strong opponents and passed four rounds in a row, which is really gratifying. Muhammad's performance in yesterday's match was extremely brilliant. The match lasted five sets, and the result was 6-4, 14-16, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, which can be called a fierce battle.</p>
<p>American youth star Smith previously caused a great surprise by defeating famous players Mengchaer and Zhina. Yesterday, he took it a step further and defeated Hungarian Gabolai with a fierce attack, winning in straight sets without much effort. The result was 6-0, 6-4, 6-3.</p>
