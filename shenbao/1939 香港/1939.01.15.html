<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>我國戰時經濟之建設　—二十七年末之青結—</h3>
<p>（一）三原則與八綱領</p>
<p>戰時經濟建設之最大目標，厥為　得勝利，然經濟見象　經緯萬端，不有原則以為指　，何從進行？故中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會　言中曾三民主義之最高指導原理，闡述抗戰與建國之關係，相資相輔：而於民生主義中更痛論日本侵略之最大目的，實為憑藉軍事力量以施行經濟掠奪，故我國在抗戰期間，首宜謀農　經濟之維持，以謀生產力之發展；其次新興工業直接間接關係抗戰之經濟力量，至深且鉅，必須全政府與全人民的力量，力謀復興，從而揭舉二原則：第二，以極端之節約與刻苦，以從事於生產的資本之累積與產業之振興；第二，一切產業復興之計劃當集中於求抗戰之勝利，泯除平日因其地位或其　業利害感情之不同，向共同之目的而邁進；第三，經濟之建設，政府必當根據民生主義之信條、施行計割經濟：凡事業之宜於國　者，由國家籌集資本，從寧興辦，務使之總於生產合理化；其宜於私人企業渚，由私人出資舉辦，在國家整個計劃之下，受政府之指導及獎勵。</p>
<p>為求抗戰必勝，建國必成，更制定抗戰建國綱領七類，其中關於經　者更分八種：第一，經濟建設，以軍事為中心，同時注意改善人民生活，本此目的，以實行計劃經濟，獎勵海內外人民投資，擴大戰時生產：第二，以全力發展農村經濟。獎礪合作，調節糧食，並開墾荒地，疏通水利；第三，開發礦產，樹立重工業之，礎，鼓勵輕工業之經營，並發展各地之手工業；第四，推行戰時稅制，澈底改革財務行政；第五，統制銀行業務，從而　整工商業之活動；第六，鞏固法幣，統制外匯管理進出口貨以求安定金融；第七，整理交通糸統，舉辦水陸空聯運，增築鐵路，公路，加闢航綫；第八，嚴禁奸商壟斷居奇投機操縱實施物品平價制度。</p>
<p>一年以來，中國經濟建設，無不吻合此三原則，而經液濟建設之事項，亦無不遵循此八綱領，爰就其重要各項，分別論述，以供關　戰時我　經濟者之參考與研討。</p>
<p>（二）財政上之建設</p>
<p>近年以來，中國財政建設已有顯著之進步。二十五年十月起創設之所得稅，已為戰時財政添一重要泉源。自八一二中日戰爭正式發動後，國民政府為鼓勵救國捐輪起見，發行救　公債九萬萬元，十足發行，現已銷罄。同時後公佈「非常時徵收印花稅暫行辦法』九條與『士酒加徵與舉辦土烟絲稅辦法』五條，『出口及轉口稅則　行章程』七倏施行。拄是戰區日益擴大，向為稅收中，宗之關鹽統二稅，所能徵收者實已無幾，例如關稅，據社會經濟月報估計保全口岸廿七年稅收約計八千萬元。在政府方面，勢須另籌財源以資挹注。籌欵之法，不外加稅或舉辦新稅，募集內外債，加發細幣二端。以加稅論，向為徵取賦稅之所在地，泰半變成戰區，稅已無從收起，遑論加徵。以增發紙幣而論，適足以告成通貨膨賬之弊，紊亂戰時金融，莫此為甚。是故應付此浩大之戰時支出，其所能資為挹注而免負担之不平者，厥為舉辦　稅與募集國債而已。</p>
<p>（甲）關於舉辨新稅者</p>
<p>二十七年十月二十八日國府公佈「非常時明過分利得稅條例一十七條七規定：（一）凡司商號行棧工廠或個人資本在千元以上之營禾事業，官商合辨之營利業，及一時營事業，其利得超過資本額百分之十五者：（二）財產租賃之得利，超過　財產價格百分之十二者。各級稅率自百分之十至百分之五十：以二十七年七月一日為起徵日期，每半年徵收一次，但依各業性質，得按月或一次徵收。在十月六日，　府公佈一遺產稅暫行條例」二十四條，規定凡人於死　時，在中華民　領士內遺有財產，及中華民國人民在本國領士內有住所，而在國外有遺產　，均應徵稅。所謂遺產者，卽被繼承人之　產不動產及　他切有財產價之權利。自遺產總　在五千元以上者起徵，稅類自百分之一至百分之五十，定於一十八年一月一日實行。</p>
<p>（乙）發行公債</p>
<p>舉辦新稅，固為戰時財政之根本大計，但新稅之成效難胡，故於抗戰財政，殊有緩　急之感。况　對內對外，在在需欵孔急之秋，益以抗戰經濟之建設，又無不需用資金。是以除主辦新稅之外，不得不藉發行公債以資挹注。自中日戰爭發生以來，所舉借之國債，計國幣十萬零四千七百萬元，　金一萬萬元，外幣一萬五千萬法朗，英金一千零十四萬四千鎊，美金大萬元，試觀下表所列：</p>
<p>就上述而論，可見中國戰時財政之建設，發行公債乃為主要之手段，然此未足為我國戰時財政之疵點，徵諸歐戰時各國財政之措施，蓋有足稱矣。</p>
<p>（丙）關於地方財政者</p>
<p>至於地方財政，平時本甚支絀。戰時尤甚。財政上彌補之方法，除有省銀行者可透支若干外，其他亦不得不秘　於公債政策。吾人確知已經發行者約為六千萬元。茲列表如次：</p>
<p>地方財政除發行公債外；對於稅收之繁項，稅率之曾高與稅源之　關，收支出之節約，無不努力以赴。茲就廣西省財政設淤以觀，則對於各省財政情形，不難舉一反三也。</p>
<p>關於省財政者，按國省稅性質分別調整稅收，在未　整以前暫行照舊辦理：擴充省縣公營事業。使　業收人成為政府重要財源：整理土　辦土地稅；舉辦城　地價稅：繼續推行房屋稅，省縣各種稅捐，均以直接徵收為原則，逐漸廢除代徵及包商制行政機關　不兼徵稅欵為原則，逐漸將省縣兌捐，歸稅捐　徵局辦理；酌提菸酒費稅附加及營業稅，撥充縣　方經　。並定其分　標準；限制各種稅捐之附加，或以其他名目　行的稅及比例派捐；　定由銀　代理縣金庫章則，逐漸由銀行代理縣金庫。關於縣財政者：責成各縣督促區鄉（鎮）村（　）切實協助稅收機關執行職務；督促各縣繼續調查未納賦　之土地，按其地價酌收捐費督促各縣健全縣財監，統一基層組織之收支及保管事務。關於會計審計者；厲行　計制度；實行鄉村預算及會計；嚴密執行事前事後審計；推行就地　計；積極推行　察事務；並注重各機關財產之普查。</p>
<p>（三）貨幣金融之建設</p>
<p>我國在二十四年冬施行法幣之後，幣制統一，金融穩固。惟是兩廣因政局關係，雲　省因地理關係。法幣尙未能推行。其後二十五年八月二十一日與二十六年六月二十日二次改革廣東幣制取消毫券而雲桂兩省　制仍末能統一，摧行法幣，然白戰　發生之後，中央政治經濟力量移入西南各省，雲桂幣制亦告統一，於去中國整個幣制因戰事而愈形統一矣。</p>
<p>在金商方面之建設。戰爭初起，卽有安定金融辦法之公布與安定金融補充辦法核准，以及中央交農四　聯合辦事處之組繳與四行　放委員會之立。二十七年三月以迄六月為止，先後日進出口外匯統制與改善地方金融機構辦法大綱之施行，以及漢口金融會議决議各項辦法。</p>
<p>（甲）廣西推行法幣</p>
<p>當施行　幣之時，現毫禁止行使，廣西銀行遂乘機收兌，益以省府歲　不敷　在該行透支甚　，發行數額竟達二千餘萬　，尙　不應求，二十五年內軍用浩繁，增發三千餘萬，桂幣價值在跌不已。所幸不和平告成，省府迭請中央救濟，終以桂幣與法幣之比價高跌爭執，迄無結果。二十六年中日戰事既　，法定　鈔兩元合法幣一元，同時中央為整理廣西金融充實桂　準備起見，於十二月發行整理公債一千七百萬元。</p>
<p>（乙）雲南推行法幣</p>
<p>雲南省遲至二十六年五月方始推行法幣，經省政府綏署决定辦法實行：（一）自五月十五日起滇省境內完納收付一切公公公私欵項，槪以法幣為　，不得行使現金；（二）行使法幣以中央·中國·交通一銀行紙幣單位較小之一元以下小票為限富滇銀行新舊銀紙幣一律行使（三）凡持銀幣生銀者，限自五月十五日起三個月內向富滇新銀行及分行辦事處各法幣兌換所兌換。廿七年財部　　前富　銀行發行之美印紙幣收　辦法，限自九月一日至十一月底止，一次收回結束，惟因交通不便，特延期三個月至二十八年二月底止，由富滇新銀行辦理結束，逾期作廢。</p>
<p>（丙）統制外匯之設施</p>
<p>自安定金融辦法公佈後，農商工礦各業所需資金，仍應維持供應。惟金融業為應付提存起見，均原自準備，望　放欵。中國中央信備銀行雖未成立，然過去對金融恐慌盡救濟之職責者，均為四政府銀行，故財部乃令四行辦理貼放。同時安定金　補介辦雖暫時阻止資金外流，　機構殘缺，未能普遍收效，必需管理貿易，統制外匯。二十七年三月北平所謂一聯合準備銀行」成立，發行無担保不兌現紙　後，我國為保障外匯基金起見，同年三月十　日公佈外匯請核辦法三條購買外匯請核規則六條，其後迭有增進，四月十二日令上海通訊處成立，四月十四日令提供現金，月七日令銀行申請外匯應記明進口商名稱金額，與中請行祗准取，六份之三便士手續費，六月十日令　匯申請書中需詳記品名數量金額產地等項目，八月八日起史　為定貨核准制，中央銀行團有外匯賣出，而無買入，究屬非策，且放任出口外匯於市場活動，影響於匯價前途者亦鉅，理宜集中於中央銀行，旣以滋生外匯頭寸，兼以穩定法幣價，故在四月二十五日又有統制出口外匯各項辦　之施行。主要辦法共有倏例四種：（一）商人運貨出口及售結外匯辦法，（二）出口貨物應結外匯之種類及　辦法，（三）關係機關稽查出口貨產外匯注意事項，（四）實施一出口貨物應結外匯之種類及其辦法」注意事項。規定出口貨物應將所得外幣售與中國或交通銀行——事實上中交兩行冉轉售給中央　行。應售結外匯出口貨物逐漸擴充為二十四種，後改為二十三類，以後更有刪减，自二十八年元旦起更減為桐油·猪棕·牛皮·茶　·礦砂·五倍子·皮貨·藥材·牟毛·蠶絲·苧蔴·腸衣·鴨毛等·三大類。</p>
<p>（丁）改善地方金融辦法大綱</p>
<p>四行聯合貼放，固足以增强中央及特許銀行領導金融調劑工商之實力，惟是地方金融機關之機構急待改善，資力更需充實，故四月末財部公佈改善地方金融機辦法大綱十條，特准各地方金融　關得向中中交農四行領用一元　與輔幣券，但以辦理下列與農工　有關之業種為條：（一）農產品倉庫之經營，（二）農業品之備押，（三）種子肥料耕牛農日之貸款，（四）農田水和事業之貸欵，（五）農業票據之承受或貼現，（六）完成台法手續及有繼續收益之土地房產抵押，（七）工廠廠產之抵押，（八）工業原料及製成品之抵押，（九）商業票據之承受或貼現，（十）公司債之經理發行或抵押，（十）照章發息之公司股票之抵押，（十二）農林　礦業出品及日用國貨商品之押抵。是項領舉辦　之用意，純在鼓勵金融機關向農工礦方面邁進，以矯正往昔偏重商業之失，更欲使資金悉　　人農村，盡月於生　之途，關於農業方面　佔五項之多。戰時安定金融辦法乃消極的限制，地方金融改革綱要則為積極的建設矣。</p>
<p>（戊）黃金政策之進展</p>
<p>我國戰時貨幣金　上之建設，除前述者外，尚有黃金政策之進展，英美借欵之成立與中美貨幣協定之延期，重要性亦殊未可忽視。</p>
<p>自二十四年中國白銀收歸國有之後對於黃金買賣自由，僅用海關金結價以統制金價，惟黃金具有國際幣材之資格。黃金保有量愈多，相對的顯示該國對外購買力之雄厚。自抗戰以來，我國收集黃金亦為戰時經　重要政策之一，當　國公倩募集時卽規定，以用黃金或金類購債，二十六年十月十日公佈金類換法幣辦法與　行規則，規定以生金，金器等兌換法幣者給以百分之三——之手續費，購救國公債者加給百分之六，作為法幣存欵者加給週息二匣，二十七年五月一日發行金公債，規定以生金及其製成品或金幣等類繳　者，按其所含純金數量依關金單位每一關金為純金六〇·一八六六公毫折合、即以關金債票發給。二十七年十一月一日公佈監督銀樓業收兌金類辦法，規定銀樓業敗進或售出赤金及　成金原金等槪以具有飾物器具之形狀者為限，金條塊葉，沙金，礦金，一槪不准收售，專以收買沙金礦金之店舖不兼營銀樓業者，應向中央銀行接洽訂立承受委託代收金類合同，悉數轉售中央銀行不得私自出售，在二十七年十一月中財部限制私運黃金出口及運往淪陷區，規定黃金及任何形狀之金飾，除經財部給　特准者外，一律禁止携連出洋，或運往淪陷區域。總觀戰時黃金政策之進展，最大之目的厥為收集民間金類以增厚外匯基金，蓋我國為加强法幣對外匯價之鞏固起見，不得不極　設法收集民間金類也。</p>
<p>（己）中美貨幣協定延期與信用借欽</p>
<p>舉借外債，亦為戰時鞏固幣值安定金　重要政策之一。我國於二十七年九月遺派經　使節陳光　席你懋一行赴美，閱時三月，與美財部及私人團體商談果，貨幣協定延長有效　間，成立二千五百萬元信用借欵。據哈瓦斯十二月十九日電，美財長談話謂中美兩　前於一九三九年七月九日所成立之貨　協定，我國得以存美之黃金作為担保品，而自美國獲取信用放欵，我國中央銀行曾　保障中美兩國利益之某種倏件下，取獲此種信用放款，以便和匯之穩定，此項協定至一九三八年底止滿期後，仍常賡繼有效。按九三七年七月九日，中美財長對中美金輪互換協定，共同官言曾謂繼續一九三六年五月所訂　銀　幣協定，在相五可能接受條件下，我國向美購買大量黃金，美國為協助中國增加黃金準備起見，續向我國　銀；並擬將　方商定辦法——卽我國中央銀行可在保障雙方利條件下　得美匯以安定通員一點，予以擴大。是故貨幣協定與信用借欵，殆即擴大商定辦法之結果也。影響所及，愈形加强法幣價值之穩固。蓋銀價漲跌無常，並無世界通貨之資格，而各國現難　已停止金本位制，但黃身　國際金融關仍維持價值儲藏之職能，中美貨幣協定延長，當　給予我國銀易為黃金之種種便益，以增强法幣外匯基金之價值。其次，信用借欵無論其為貨幣　或貨物，均經直接間接增加外匯基金，而使法幣價值穩定。</p>
<p>除　國二千五百萬美元之信用借欵外，英國在原則上允許一萬鎊之信用放欵貸予我國，第一次所據付者為五十萬鎊，專作購置載重汽車與運輸材料之用。</p>
<p>（四）其他經濟建設</p>
<p>（甲）交通上之建設</p>
<p>今日西南北諸省，已成　中一抗戰必勝，建國必成一之根據地，以是我國戰時時經濟設亦均集中西南北諸省。但經濟建設中首要在財貨幣金融之建設　利用之以推動其他之經濟建設，次為交通經濟建設，　交通路綫開關後，「抗戰」國」及經濟建設所需之物資，始得充實，而供給不虞　缺乏。</p>
<p>在交　上，建設，可分公路　鐵道兩方面。關於公路者：有西南公路綱，由湖南省以通達貴州四川雲南兩　等省及緬甸之公路綫，有西北公路綱，由北省以通達河南陜西甘，新疆省之公路綫：有西南北溝通公路綱，由四川省以通邊陜甘之公路綫。關於鐵道者：在西南造　滇（貴陽之昆明），川漢（錢府至昆明），滇緬（昆明至　緬邊界之蠻允鎭及緬甸之莫一三鐵道，尤滇緬失路之建業，對於打通歐洲國際交通有重大意義，可以節省西南詻省與國外交通之行程與時日也。</p>
<p>（乙）農礦工商之建設</p>
<p>在抗戰發動後，對於國內經濟之開發，力事調整，尤注盧於國方有關係者。二十六年十二月二十二日國府公布戰時農　工商管理條例，而由車事委員會依此項條例官理。并於軍事委員之下設立　易調　委員會，基金一千萬元；農產　整委員會，基金三千萬元，工礦調整委員會，基金一千萬元，均由財部特撥抵充。一年　來，成績斐然。</p>
<p>貿易會現隸財部，改稱貿易委員會，以促進土貨外銷為主務，與出口外匯統制相　而行。例如湘皖浙贛之茶葉，江浙蜀之　紛，蜀鄂蘇之猪棕皮毛，湘鄂蜀之桐油等　物。二十七年六月中財部更訂定促進出口貿易辦法，分：（甲）减輕出口成本，以促進出口外銷；（乙）調整土貨市價，以維護國內生產。蓋中部份則因國際市場不振，貨價下落下以致經　出口商人偶受　銷損失，轉而影響生產事業，而定之補救辦法；乙部份則凶法定匯率與黑市發生差異，商人要求隨市價售給外匯，或由政府以現金補償而定之補救辦法也。</p>
<p>農產調整委員會現隸經濟部，甬農本局，農業試驗所兩機關與之相輔而行，農本局專司辦理資金之貸放，　騐所專司改良　產之　術。此外經　部訂　補助各　農業　進經費辦法，除合作事業外，凡農業改進機關改　經貨可依本法請機補助。財經兩部訂有擴大農村貸欵範圍辦法六條，現定凡依照改善　方金　構辦法綱要領用一元券與輔幣券之金　機關，及依法成立之合作金庫，對增加農　各種放欵，應儘量利用各種合作社，但在抗戰期間，凡經放款機關承認之農民組求，亦得為貸欵對象。</p>
<p>工　調整委員會見亦隸經濟部，與資源委員會分工合作，為謀公私企業基礎之固鞏，前者協助各地民營工廠由戰區遷往安全地帶，繼價營運。計經政府協助遷往內地各省者有三百數十家。其中一百餘家在　川省。後者專司在內地各省國營各種重工業——鋼鐵化電力機械以及礦冶之類。例如經濟部協助某　關建設一規模較大之鋼鐵廠今年　間竣工後，每日可出相當鋼　。又協助　氏　製浩鋼鐵廠，不日卽出產。化學工業之硫　硝酸阿比尼亞等，約請辦理此項工業素有經驗之永利公司出力辦理。此外國府在二十七年八月七日公布工業獎勵法，特種工業保息及補助條例，由經濟部核辦之。前者規　在國內外市塲有國際競爭者，採用外國最新方法製造者，與享有專　權之製造者，得請求　　或免除（一）出口稅（二）原料稅（三）國營交通事業之運費，與（四）給予獎金（五）一定區域內五年，專製權。後者規定製造原動力機，電機，工作機器，金屬材料，液體燃料，運輸器材等之特　工業，得請求保息，——實收資本五厘，債票六厘，以七年為限，或補助——以各品類每年生　費及市價為標凖，酌　給予現金。</p>
<p>之，戰時　礦工商之建設，由經財兩部主持之，而由三委員會推動之益以部屬機　輔助之。惟因此項建設，發　於「抗戰必勝，建國必成，」關係機密。情報簡闕，以致不能詳加闡述，是可憾耳。</p>
<h3>華北抗戰槪況　與今後形勢估計</h3>
<p>— 彭德懷講于嗚鳳記</p>
<p>各位抗日同志、今天有各報記者、文化界朋友、在這裏衆會起、實在是很不容易、　得吹喜的、我們雖然有前方後方的不同、作上有　區別、然而總的任務、却是一致的、同時、×人的厲害和屠殺、無論前方和後方也是一樣地慘酷、我們中華民挨所受的痛苦相同、所　我們工作目標也都是一致為着抗×戰爭勝利而鬥爭、</p>
<p>現在、我將華北一年半抗戰情形、告訴後方抗×同志、同時也是介紹給全國同胞、全國軍隊、以及全世界人士、使全國人民和全世界人十得到具體了解、</p>
<p>一華北一般槪況　甲、民衆工作的目的與槪況　Ａ目的：</p>
<p>民衆工作的目的在發動民衆與組織民衆、擁護政府、護民族領袖、擁護抗戰軍隊、執行抗戰建國綱領、鞏固抗×團結、肅淸漢奸、帮助和參加抗×軍隊、來達到抗日戰爭勝利、爭取中華民族之解放、</p>
<p>發動民衆與組織民衆、是要使抗×力量更加發揮、更加團結、這不是為着那一黨那一派、而是為着抗×戰爭的勝利、必須開展民衆運動、前綫軍隊、天天與×作戰、須要大批兵員的補充、動員全國人民到抗×軍隊中參加戰爭、這是神聖的、然而也必須加强民衆工作、才有辦法、為了抗戰要、在後方努力生產、增加生產、也需要發動民衆、在×人後方、打擊×人、騷擾×人、破壞×人、破壞偽組織、打擊漢奸、更幣要民衆的力　、否則×人組織偽組織將達到以華制　的目的、我們淪陷區的財富，也將　×利用、同時、我們也知道、中國軍隊過去的缺點、軍隊是僱傭的軍、要想軍隊的抗×情緒是高、必須有革命的民衆參加軍　、同時抗×的軍隊、必須帮助羣衆運動的發展、民衆與軍隊武力眞正視密地　合起來、戰鬥力才能在在的增强、戰爭之最後勝負主要的不是取决于技術、而是决定於人力、中國四萬萬五千萬人民、發動和組　起來、便是勝利的有力泉源、這裏、并不是說軍隊，要新式裝備和技術、則是說主要條件、取决於民衆倍大的大量，我們抗戰堅持十八個　，則是依靠於民　、而且今後戰爭的持久與最後勝利、還是要靠民衆、</p>
<p>「抗戰建國綱領」當中、明白的說到「抗戰必勝、建國必成」但這并不是空洞的口號、而是需要實際的工作艱、苦的努力、才能達到的、三民主義的新中國才能實現的、這實現和勝利的基礎、便在於發　民衆和組織民、</p>
<p>華北是中國抗戰的重要方向、而且是最後戰勝日×决戰的戰場、過去十八個月的抗戰中、充分地證明了民衆的重要性、其實他正因為發揮民衆自己的力量、才能獲得了不斷勝利、收復了廣大領士、奠定了華北抗戰的基礎、不然的話、華北或將已成為滿洲第二、不堪設想了、有些人對此尙發生誤會，　實、我們從華北　黃河到西安、雖祇一河之隔、便有很大的不同感覺、我總希望不要誤會，也不必誤會，大胆地　靠民、任民衆、發動民衆、組織民衆、才是最正確的辦法、</p>
<p>所以、我們可以肯定的說、只有把民衆抗×情緒　高、自覺的參加抗×軍隊、才能密切軍隊與人民的關係、只有革命的民衆運動、才會產生革命的軍隊、只有革命的武裝、才能與民衆親密合作只有武力與民衆合作、才能發生偉大力量、只有依靠着民衆自覺帮助戰爭、抗×戰爭才能　久、才能克服民　解放戰爭中所必然遇到的困難、只有把全民族一切主動力　、動　　　起　、才能爭取充戰最後勝利、才是抗戰必勝，建國必成的可靠　在、</p>
<p>Ｂ×××行與華北民衆義憤：</p>
<p>過去十八個月中、日×在華北做了些什麽罪惡×行、偶然　紙上也有披露、但實際上所披露才還不及萬分之一、有好多兇惡×行是人　想不到的、野蠻殘酷是說不盡的、就　燒房子一項來說、從保定到石家莊這一長離富中、沿半漢鐵路兩旁十五里附近的村工完全燒得精光、我們知道　　都是人口稠密的地方、可想有多少人無辜　牲、在山西、沁縣、武鄉、遼縣、和順、昔陽等地方被燒殺者不知有多少、至於××更不稀奇、　老太婆也都難倖免、小孩亦被×死、這都是歷史上所沒有的、可見過去十八個月中、特別是去年（二十七年）四月以後、華北人民、不論貧富、不必性　、不分老幼、無日不在　×飛機矗炸、和屠殺、××，燒搶之中，在平漢，津浦，平綏、正太幾條鐵路之間、災民　一千萬人、這是怎樣一個巨大的　人　數目、</p>
<p>但是、由於日××××××、激起華北人民的義憤、反　的巨流、普遍地燃燒　每一個角落裏、民衆自的起來反抗日×、并且他們們自己的經　中、創造出許多辦法來、</p>
<p>比如、（一）石家莊西三十里許的地方、×××兵　常去　行××、民衆激於義憤、男子穿了紅衣，以為引誘、瘋狂成性的×丘、見之　追、民衆誘人山中、把他們殺掉、繳了槍支、這並不是說華北人引誘×兵、而是　明了×兵瘋狂的　麽程度、這樣的事、有過好幾次、現在這裏人民已經有　百支　、成為一支擊隊了、個、老進姓叫做、「石家莊西男扮女裝巧計　×』</p>
<p>（二）正太路南之昔陽、日本兵倉　老百姓飯食、老百姓當起　鍋頭把日本兵打死了、這個、老百姓叫做、「破鍋頭掘死日本兵」、</p>
<p>（三）山西仆休縣電報局長兩夫婦、在×人巳迫介休三十里附近，還堅守　務，迄日軍包圍電報局、兩夫婦　不附×、自殺殉職、（以下轉入第六版）</p>

<h3>中蘇關係　立法院長　——在招待重慶文化界席上演詞——</h3>
<p>不要性急在英美法沒有聯合一致以前、不但蘇聯不能輕舉妄動、我們也不希望他單獨出乒、</p>
<p>平日我們常常誇口說我們戰大物博、可是實際上還有比我們地更大物更傳的國家、就是蘇聯、　聯的領土、　中國三倍、我們都知道蘇聯革命成功以後、只是兩個五年計劃、現在他的工業生　、在歐洲已占第一位、在世界占第二位、可是我們在目並沒　看見蘇聯往外推的什麽商品、因為在事實上國內的生產、遠不够他們自己的消費、本來　聯不是資本主義國家、所以工人的工資、一天天提高、工　因為收人豐當、於是購買力强、所以每日所生產的物品、還不够他們自己享用、至於國內的天然富源、不要說兩個五年計圖、就是再過百年、也開　不完、所以蘇聯的國力、是大賦　　、他們在友誼上的確是希望中國富强，並沒有獨霸遠東的企圖，</p>
<p>諸位在最近也許沒有出國、不曉得最近外　情形兄弟在去年曾經到過好幾個地方、深知道中國在國在外宣　、自己經手辦的、還沒有蘇聯替我們宣傳的普遍、蘇聯替我們宣傳的報紙、一個是政府方面、一個是黨的方面、每天所登的消息、都是有利於中國的、對於×人的宣傳消息、一槪卜登、他為什麽要這樣做呢、就是為使他本國的人民、曉得中國的偉大、知道中國是一定可以勝利、同時他們的評論、也是說中國　民族的生存而抗戰、所以我們在他們評論中國的文章裏、無　是那一篇那一句，簡直有不到有不利於中國的地方、這並不是我們要求的結果、都是他們自動的</p>
<p>偉大同情的援助、但是在蘇聯以外、美國對於中國是同淸的、英法對於中國也是同情的、可是看英法等國的報紙、對于中國又是怎樣的情形呢，左派的報紙、還可以替　們宣　、並且　勵我們努力抗戰、至於右派的報紙、則以；解不同、有時對我抗戰前途、表示懷疑，還說日本怎樣的富强、中國不應當和日本打仗、應當以弱事强、現在抗戰、太不度德、不量力了、所以在國外看起夾、蘇聯定完全沾在我們方面的確是我們的朋友、但是反過來講呢、在我國方面、最近也還有幾種刊物、選譯反對蘇聯的文字登載出來、　聯朋友們看見這種文字、當然是不高興的、須知、目前中國需要蘇聯帮忙的地方正　、　蘇聯是無所求於人的國家、更無所求於我國、進一步說、卽使我們反對、又有甚麽用　、至於蘇聯對中國抗戰的看法、當中　戰事發動之初、他就說過、中國一定能得最援勝利、他是用</p>
<p>科學方法來觀察，好像比我們還看得淸楚一點、他說中國有四萬萬五　萬人口如果人人都沒有抗戰的思想、那麽亡國滅種是不用說了、但是中國人並不如此、因為經過幾十年革命思想的陶鎔、全國人民己經都有民埃生存的認識、就是尋常的老百姓、都能堅强認定非對日抗戰不可、現在不但是日本亡不了中國、　是世界的侵略强暴也亡不了中國、因為他們是有過歷史的和驗　、當十月革命以後、在一九一七　一九二〇年國內非常紊亂，國內有反功派的搗亂、同時合列强英美法德波蘭等國乃至日本、都去攻擊蘇聯、出一九一七年直到一九二〇年整打了二年、而蘇聯一方面應付國內反動，一面對外抗戰、當時蘇聯紅軍只有彼得格勒、莫斯科兩個地方、所有工廠已經那　炸　、經　旣不充足、糧食也不够用、是經　們堅强的抗戰到一九二〇　、卒能收到勝利、最初紅軍的數量不過十幾萬人、到一九二〇年、紅軍人數竟增加至五百多萬、找們要知道他是幾種革命同時舉行、對內是　會革命、剷除地主和資本家、對外是民族革命、打倒列軍對他的侵　、那未比起中國來、現在我們的問題簡單多了、因為中國唯一的×人、就是日本、至於內地漢奸、是沒有什麽力量的、我們可以不必在放眼裏、目前國內絕對統一、中央政權日益鞏固、斯以根據他們的歷史相敎訓、認為中國革命是非成功不可的、</p>
<p>當蘆溝橋事　以前、中央所指揮的軍　不過一百師、具中師有大小、小的每師不過五千、共計不過一百萬人、現在已經有二百四十多個帥、都經過整理充實、算　來比從前的兵力巳加到一倍以上、所以說我。</p>
<p>愈打愈強其他各種軍械的補、比較戰　都增加一　。以至　倍、這都是眞確的事實、至於作戰經騐、在蘆溝橋事變以前、我國的軍隊、沒有對外打過仗、雖然年年有戰事、都是國內的戰爭、一般　官士乒、都受了日本的宣傳，不知道自已有多少力量、總以為日本的軍隊、是了不得、但是打到現在大家都知道了、×人的力景、不過如此、當淞滬戰爭時、平均×人傷亡一個人、我們要傷亡到五個人、徐州會戰時　、×人亡一個人、我們也得要　　到三個人、等到沿江的戰事、×我傷亡已　相當、至於華北游擊戰、據最近趙個的報告、我們的軍隊、一個人最少要換×人三個人、山西的游擊戰、據說平均我們一個人要瑍×人十四　半、照這抗戰、　能說不勝利呢、在×人的心中、總以為　漢廣州相繼失陷、我們就不能繼續同他作戰了、並覺得香港的進口　了困難、我們的軍火斷了接　、其實我們早有準備、依現在的情形、再打十年、軍火接　、也是不成問題的、</p>
<p>當我們從首都退出時，英國就有人說、中國劉日本的抗戰、也許每戰皆敗、但是最後的勝利、是屬於中國、因為日本是不會永久這樣支持的、我們知道×人的軍事　劃、本來想不用兵便可以屈服了中國、只把兵力調動一下、向中國示威、中國就會屈服的、但是蘆溝橋事變發生後，他知道不用兵不行了、最初他所提的預算只是一個月、　他以為一個月總可以把事解決了後來他知道一個月不能解決、於是又　出來三　月的預算、在他以為三個月就可以消滅了中國、現在已經　到十八個月了、還沒有把中國怎麽樣、最初他只開來三十萬　、現在已增加到一百五　萬兵、所以×人速戰速决的企圖、己經打砂、現在是想速和了、　是我們還是和他作戰、照近來的情形、好像戰場都沒有什麼消息、似乎戰事已經停頓、其實這就是×人已　應付不了、因為他和我們作戰、每天要用兩千萬元、　年就是七十二萬禹、過去已經用了八十幾萬萬、下年度預算當然還要增加八十萬　、日本每年的收人、不時不　八九九萬萬元、照上面的數子算起　、他年的　費、要　年的收入才能夠相抵、從　日本的藏相高橋說過、日本的國債、如果到一百萬萬、就非亡國不可、現在他的國債已經到了一百幾十萬萬、再過一年、至少要到二百五十萬萬、姑以年息厘計利、一年就是要付二萬萬多的利息、而他們戰時的收入、每年也不過是十　萬萬、　這樣他們把收入　作為戰債的利息、還不够分配，在財政上豈不是一個大題嗎、所以最近他們改內閣、其原因就是因為要行總動員　、可見、人在經濟上已經是沒有辦法了，如能施行總動員，就可以沒收人　的財，我想　久×人的經濟機　、也許會因此而總崩潰的、　使我　就這樣的同他迤下去、再過一年、非求和不可、冉一年不同他和、他非滾蛋不可、所以最後勝利、已經擺在我們的眼　、</p>
<p>現在旣然曉得×人的力量是這樣的脆弱、就不必再要求別人來參加、將來我們單獨的把日本打下去、誰敢　我們　分　、所以我們的前途、已經很光明、抗戰　現在、已經十八個月了、至少冉有十八個月、就可以枚到勝利、只是多吃一兩年苦　了、等　日本打下、　時中國的地位是怎樣、中國　東亞又是怎樣、到那時候我們才眞能安定東　、才眞能建立東亞的和平秩序，我以這個能力完全操之在我、先大已經决我們這個資格、而日本沒有這種資格的、日本將來的生俘、還要靠我們來支　、同時我們還是以三民主義來立國、就是在復興以後、也還是和平的國家、並用不着去侵峪別人、到那時候、雖為東亞的主要國　、和其他國家還是都佔在平等的　位上、所以造成這樣和平的幸福、我們是先天所賦予的責任、只有我們才能够担起這個責任來、現在我們有種種</p>
<p>優越條件、是×人所沒有的、第一、我們有三民主　、過去國內對於三民主　還有懷疑的、以為三民主義不是很新的、在三民主義以外，還有更新的主義、須知我們信仰一個主義、必須能使他實現、然後才有用處、如果說某種主義非常的、但是非一百年或五百年後不能實現、那時不能救我們的急的、共產主義也計是最高的理想、不過不能適用於今日的中國、加末我們就行不來、、所以在中國共產黨的朋友們、現在也一致來　護並實行三民主義、×人是沒有什麽主義的、近衛平沼、有什麽主義呢、我們雖然想學法西、但他們並不曉得法西是怎樣一回事、第二、我們有全國一致愛戴擁護的領袖蔣委員長、來領導大家、而×人所謂近衛、能够算是他們的領袖嗎？平沼史不必談了、所以我們生在這個時代、眞是幸運、假使早生些年、便看不見　個時代、遲生些年又趕不上這個時代、所以現什我們作中國人是世界上最榮耀的人、我們態當何等的　傲、經過這這八個月的抗戰、我們的華僑、和駐外使節，在外　受到人家何等的敬愛、記得去年四月已黎「上海樓」吃飯的時　、樓主人向　個客人面前送斟杯紅酒、當時有人問他說我們沒有要酒、為什麼都肖酒呢？他說諸位喝　、因為台兒莊中國軍隊勝、這是本樓贈送諸位　的、於是大家一起立起來、舉酒高呼中華民國萬歲、所以說現　的中國人，是世界上最光榮的人了、現在我們對日本抗戰、已經有　八　月、那個國家敢出來打日本一下、英美雖然　强、並沒有出來打他下呀、所以現在正我們中國人昂首吐氣的時候、將來等我們打下日本去、世界上的人對於我們還不知要怎　的　佩呢？</p>
<p>過去一部份留學生從外國回外、以祖國的東西全是不好、甚至月亮都沒有外國的好、這是</p>
<p>妄自菲薄、兄弟也留過學的、可是每一次囘國、總覺得世界上沒有那　　可比得上中國　、就以蘇聯說、他雖然　大物博，但是因為所處的地位關係、人氣太冷了、我們中國地方大好了、就以重慶說　、有人說重慶天氣不　、可是兄弟覺得重慶的氣候太好了、像今天這樣的天氣、×機就無法侵人上空、這不是一種天然保嗎？諸位也沒有到過歐洲的、究竟歐洲有什麽好呢？據兄弟看、只是人工整理的比我們多一點、但是這一點我們馬上就可以起來建設、沒有什麼了不</p>
<p>歐洲最大的國家、除了　聯以外、東歐西歐那算在一起、國不過七千多萬人口、物產不如中國、英國是四千六百萬人口，法國意國都才四千二百萬人口、過去法國人口很減了不少、後來法國政府覺得這樣戈　下去非常危　、所以由政府獎勵生育、但是結果、直釗現在並沒有怎樣的增加這純粹是天　的、至於德國意國呢，都因為國內的物產不够分　、所以才出來打人家的主義、我們中國呢，天然地人多地大　物博、只是從前我們生活太馬虎、不知道團結努力、現在我們　三民主義把大家的精神都高起來，那末中國　革命前　、一定會得成功的、再如是克、在前幾個月　沒有瓜分的時候、他本有一千幾百萬人口、　歐洲小國　邊總算是一個强國、他們說中國向日本抗戰了一年、還能維持下去、眞是了不得的國家、並且說中國不但是一個國，而且是一個强國、並且目前中國已經是强　了、只是中國自己還沒有知道、現在幾個月去了、我們依然存在、而捷克　那里去了、因為捷克　竟是一個小　、天賦不够、有人說中國要購　軍　、這倒是一個好機會、現在捷克的重軍器、已經是沒有　用的機會了，可見我們天　之　、絕非他國可能比、應該提高自信心、才不辜負我們的天賦、最後我引用老朋友蔣百里先生的一句話作為結論、就是「千言萬語、只告訴大家一句話、中國是有辦法的」、（完）</p>

<h3>日本的對華戰爭　駐美大使胡適</h3>
<p>編　按：本席係　年十二月我國駐美大使胡適博士布紐約之公開　詞、原文冗長，且多史實引證，茲因篇　關係、特節譯槪要，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>如果有人問我：「用一句話去說明中國的現狀、應該如何說法？」我將毫不猶豫地回答：「中國眞是在流血中掙命！」我們的×是世界上的三强的海軍國，又是第四或第五强的陸軍國，而我們和她搏鬥，到現在已經十六個月了。我們的死傷、下一百萬、龐大的十地正在被×人所侵吞，差不多外界所知道的工商敎育文化和交通運輸中心，不是巳被×人所蹂躍、就是已成他們佔領了。我們的老百姓，拋棄了家庭田地店舖鄉鎮而　散逃命，沒有居處，沒有醫藥、甚至在大多數請形下沒有最簡單的生活工具，像這樣的，亦不下六千萬人，而每大無辜的「非戰鬥員』，被×軍殘殺的，又有千百人之多。這樣看來，中國是不是在流血中掙命呢？</p>
<p>在廣州和武漢失守後「，我國有許多人民和領袖，暫時的感覺猶豫，甚至失望，但那猶豫時期亦就是下大决心的時期。我們的領袖們不久就得到了一個結論：中國在目前　沒得到和平的可能，因為我們絲亳沒有可以在情理上接受那種和平的機會，我們的領袖們，將切困難和　能的變化、加以、重攷慮以後，乃確實决定繼續推行抗戰政策，維續抗戰。</p>
<p>蔣委員長在宣布這個新决心的時候、特別指出下列幾點；（一）中國將繼續推行其全國持久抗戰的政策，（二）現在戰爭實際上已展開到了一全國一」，×人已　入內地、無論時間或地理都對我們有利，（三）過去十六個月來的抗戰已阻止×人西進，使我們能在廣大的後方發展交通和運輪，并將若干工業搬到後方去，（四）我們要　望獲得最後的勝利不能不經過最大的困難和犧牲，（五）現在的對日抗戰一定要當做一革命的戰爭一看，它的性質和美國獨立戰爭，法蘇兩國的革命戰爭，土耳其的解放戰爭一樣，在這種「革侖的戰爭」中，人民的奮　精神必可獲得最後的勝利。以上就是中國新决心的莊嚴宣言。</p>
<p>無論世界人士對於我們這種新决心作如何感想，我可向各位老實說，一個國家已經犧牲了一百萬人，得　要為其國家生存而奮屬，作最大的犧牲，你决不能怪她將其希望寄託於區區的空想上，我們在過去十六個月內嘗受極可怕而又極有用的戰爭經騐，我們現在所下的　心。就是以這種經驗做根據，我們在這　怕的十六個月中已明白知道我們的兵十和官長都是英武勇敢，亦都作最大的犧牲，我們的人民忍受損失痛苦而並沒向其政府抱怨，而全國民族團結和統一（就是暫歸×人軍事佔領的區域，亦都包含在內）介毫無懷疑的餘地，我們同時又知道我們的×人的確在感覺到長期戰爭的負担担日本的財政快要破產，它現在所用的是全　的軍事力量，而和它作戰的國家，却又正是它　來沒有看做是足以作戰的國家，它很焦急，因為其所貯藏的軍火，本來想用，打擊其加强的×人，現在已有極人的部分消耗了？所以只要我們能持奮　、使×人　疲力盡，並非是不可能的事。</p>
<p>在美國獨立戰爭時（一七七六，一七八一）華盛頓「大陸車」的環境並不比較現在中國的軍隊的環境優良多少，實際上一切一革命的戰爭」都是具有熱烈理想，而不良配備的國民，與壓迫　或侵略國　備優良的正規軍間的戰爭，但最後　勝利差不多沒有例外，必歸於懷抱理想和勇氣而又能克服最大困難與犧牲的人。</p>
<p>再者，美國革命之所以成功，除了革命軍的持久抗戰外，還有一個同樣重嬰的原因，就是得到當時國際　勢的援助，中國要得　最　的勝利。亦必須倚賴兩件，事第一她必須抗戰下去，沒有選擇餘地只　抗戰下去；第二在她持久抗戰中，將　終有一天國際情勢會有和於中國而不利於日本，中國並不　望任　表同情的國家帮她共同作戰，但她卻有權預望各民主國家和愛好和平國家的男女國民能够禁止向那世界五十多個國家一致公認為世界和平破壞者供給軍火。我敢毫不躊躇的指出，這個國家是國際社會上的「公敵第一名」！</p>
<h3>美大批戰艦　駛大西洋　經過　運河施行警戒　行駛詳情禁止披露</h3>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>歐洲局勢突轉緊張</h3>
<p>歐洲局勢突轉緊張—什麼事表現出歐洲局勢的突然緊張　第一是英意羅馬會談的失敗，第二是德意積極擾歐菲的策數。</p>
<p>英　羅馬會談失敗了，因為它沒有任何結果。然而是誰的失敗呢？第一要看到墨　　　沒有在這次會談　得到什麽。第二，要看到張伯倫沒在這次會談中繼續屈服，看到這兩　　可明白失敗的是侵略者意大利。那麼這次會談失敗，會有什麽影響呢？有，第一是張伯倫政府在國內廣大民衆與國際正義呼籲，尤其是美國進步政策的影響之下，開始糾止慕尼黑會議以　的妥協政策，今後對法西斯侵略者的態度有不再屈服的可能了。第　，張伯倫政府將　得國內，國際的支持，尤其是　緩和了國內反政府的熱潮，如果張的妥協政策能有更大的糾正、則張政府的威信口望鞏固、第三、是英法合作將更親密、德意侵略軸心與之對立的形勢將史趨嚴重。第四，軍備擴張將飛　的進展，戰局危　的呼號將史猖狂，尢其是德　略者將作更大的侵略戰備，甚　展開了更大的侵略戰爭，是民主的和平戰綫與法西斯的侵略陣綫的對立史明顯了，特別是民主的和平陣綫將迅速的強大，完成了制裁侵略者的步驟。</p>
<p>現在歐洲局勢已因羅馬會議的失敗而突轉嚴重了，這很明顯的是出於德意侵略教師種更強橫的嚇詐的表示，尤其是當此英外長哈立法克勘赴日內瓦　晤法外長龐萊之時，什麼意大利軍趕集中索菲邊境，什麽德國加緊侵略荷蘭，甚至一切離間英　的陰　活動一種種騷擾歐菲各地的事件，都是必然會發生的，無足　奇，更應　　在和平民主各國眞正開始對德意强硬的計劃時所預計之中的。這種緊張嚴重的局勢，不能恫陽任何眞正愛　和平的國家，今日所應注意的是英法等態度應該更加朗起來，連羅馬尼亞烏克敵，波蘭，米美　，荷蘭，比利時＃中間國家，亦不許德意稍一染指，宣佈用實力反對侵略，　麼，歐局雖在萬險之中：仍有拯救可能。</p>
<h3>英人對中日戰爭的觀感</h3>
<p>— （續昨日本報倫敦通訊）　叔棣　【完】</p>
<p>有着二百萬份以上銷數的每日先驅報，是著名的丁黨機關報。它是同情中國的，然而有時又喜歡登些中國將通過德，意，關係而妥協的謠言；或懷　中國所謂「聯合陣線』的鞏固，代表自由黨說話的『新聞紀事報』，大體上，恰恰是　黨黨魁路易喬治雄辯時一類的態度，非常强烈地同情中國，非難　國現政府政策的無能，『每日　訊郵報』是英國保守黨中反對派的報紙，大體上，態度和泰晤士報近似，不同的是文章，『曼却斯牯導報』的態度，比起仟何其他報紙來，敎會的色彩都重些，它的駐中國記者，大槪和敎會很接近。</p>
<p>國會</p>
<p>英國國會的上下兩議院，是同情中國奧論的嚴力發源地。尤其是下議院，每到責問到遠東問題時，那同情中國的　子，幾乎永遠　淸色的徹底，這，每次，都把　位代表外交部答覆問題的外次巴特拉，逼到退無可退的地位，這裏，我們要連想起許許多多同情中國的政治家們的聲音和姿態。那當中，有着大雄　家的路易喬治和　吉爾，有着薜西　和克立普等勛爵，有着唯一的共產黨議員加來卡爾，不着女議　惟羅金生等等。</p>
<p>援華運動</p>
<p>所謂「援華會」是公然標着目的援華運動中的最主要的一個組織，在它推動下，組織了許多次的示或遊行，演了幾次電影，舉辦了許多次集會，幕了許多藥品及做了一些實際工作。此外，規模最大的，是經常在號召看人們捐欵救濟中國難民的倫敦市長的賑災基金，廣告經常地登在全英國的各槌刊物上。在「職工聯盟」的組織下，英國的碼頭工人，發動了好幾次的拒絕替日本船裝卸貨物的員動。抵制日貨的運動，也在推進；為了改頭換面推銷日貨，而被法院以厭惡的口吻判决罰欵的事，幾乎是，每隔幾天，就有一件一，而這一家商店，在短期內，却遭到人們的唾棄。</p>
<p>文章與書籍</p>
<p>回憶一下一年來對于英國人觀感上有着重大作用的。關於中日戰爭的文章，首先想起來的是「泰晤士報」一年來十篇以上的有力的社論。其次浮上記憶的，是出現在「每日電訊　郵報」上　邱吉爾先生的幾篇透闢的　文，再其次，就是「泰晤士報」上所戰該報　北平記者的親身訪　中國冀，魯，察，晋，豫等省邊境游擊區後所發表　幾篇文章。書籍呢，影響力最大的，是最近出現的世界名記者慕賴爾君的『中國』，其次，是斯諾君的『中國天空的紅星」以及斯沬德列女士的「中國　攻」。這些文章和書籍，再加上其他零星的文章以及書籍雜　等等，對於今天的英國人士們的中日戰爭觀，發生了重大的作用，構成了下面這一幅圖畫：——</p>
<p>一個比美國還要大的國家領土上，有着全世界四分之一的，最能吃苦耐勞的人口，在一位偉大的世界英雄領導下，作着最英勇的，甚至全營全團陣　的，壯烈犧牲的　鬥。這個國家，風景呢，是米芾王維山水　　的幽美情景，（這是前年展覽會時種下的日象）。房子是樓台亭閣式的風雅，吃是世界第一的口味。（倫敦牛冿街附近的幾家廣東館是當為了代表作），而尤其重要的。是這個民族，幾乎是先天地愛好和平。（薛西爾勛爵說過：在近百年來，中國沒有作過侵略戰爭』。）</p>
<p>可是，這祗是明顯的一面：這一面，是由於一年多的抗戰造成的，在另一面，却也有着暫時隱蔽的黑暗面，那黑暗面，祗要中國一開始　協或屈服，就會立刻又顯了出來：那是：無組織，大家全是個人主義。遍地是士匪：而尤其連自然界也跟着變了樣，一的　風沙荒凉，人們全仲在土洞裏，黃河的洪水像怪獸一般地到處掃蕩着：再配上到底擁擠着跑來跑去，像常在電影上出現的，上海租界入口那樣密蟻般的難民。</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>食在香港！</h3>
<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>六月內增加食物館六十七間</p>
<p>「食在廣州」早已聞名海內．廣州旣然這樣對食品講究，與廣州近在咫尺的杳港，免不了亦受其影嚮。「羊城美點」已經是香港每間菜館高舉着的招牌。廣州淪陷　後化「羊城美點」的亦唯有杳港而已了。</p>
<p>拿最近的桌實來說吧：食在香港還要超過吃在廣州哩！我們看吧，香港不獨有廣東菜館，川菜館，馬來菜館，爪味菜館。至於外國菜館當然亦比廣州的來得更考究。</p>
<p>這是顯明的事實，自從戰事爆發以後，香港的吃，不特質的方面有了改變，食物館的量的方面也有驚人的增加。</p>
<p>在戰前七八年來，為着不景氣的影嚮、杳港的食物館亦遭受過空前的厄運。塘西是有名的「開筵坐花，飛觴醉月」的飲宴塲所，可是因為不景氣和廢娼的緣故，幾間有名的大酒家也宣吿關鬥大吉了。市內其他大小菜館也一落千丈，倒閉的幾乎佔了全數的一半。</p>
<p>當時大酒家也要靠茶市，雀局來苟殘喘，拿着『薄利多賣』的政第，來了什麽三五角錢一味的「經濟時菜」以企適應社會低洛的購買力。至於九元四味，八元六味的「雀局菜」亦很够吸引着多少搓麻雀的賭徒。</p>
<p>中下的酒家見了新興的飲冰室生意好轉，多也掉　方針改營飲冰室業了。所謂飲冰室，幷非是祗實冰琪琳和汽水而已。原來是鮑，參，翅，肚，海鮮炒賣，粥粉飯麵，牛扒，咖啡，牛奶無所不有的食物店，因為這種飲冰室不像酒家有茶　，「檳水」貨式雖然是「具體而微』，但是價錢却很經濟，一塊幾角錢便可以吃一頓飽，所以顧客很多，符合『薄利多賢』的生意經。</p>
<p>飲冰室的興起，是當時酒　館萊山窮水盡中所發現的「又一村」初起時，因為『經濟』生意是不錯的，後來開設得多了，沒有增加的顧客，數目便給大家分散了。食物館菜館，就淸淡的可　了。</p>
<p>抗戰開始後，可就不同了；避雞的人多來來，畸形發展的香港市塲夢，首先受惠的便是菜館館食物館。任何一間菜館，餐室，茶居，冰室，食物館…：都是『利市三倍』。早，午，晚上，往往跑上幾間館子也找不到一個坐位，怪不得投機的　人加緊趕開菜館，食物館。來抓住稍縱即逝的『良機』。</p>
<p>衰落多年的香港菜館，食物館業，生機到了，新開的日有增加，從前很僻靜的街道，現在也有食物館的開設，繁盛街道更加是比比皆是了。據記者向頒發菜館，食物館牌照的主管機關，「市政衛生局」調查所得，最近六個月內——由去年七月至去年十二月——香港及　龍謂發食物館牌照的共有五十七宗，結果准許的是四十一宗，不准的十六宗，街發酒　牌照的共廿六宗，全數准許，這廿六間酒逐部是在香港的。</p>
<p>照上面的數目說：六個月內香港及九龍增加了菜館食物館六十七間。從此推算戰事發生以來一年七個多月中香港和九龍最少增加菜館　食物館足足有一百間以上的驚人數目。</p>
<p>香港雖然仍在住屋恐慌中，但是有很多住屋給人家拆了改建大酒家，大飯店，所以有人說：將來香港的生活，睡要睡在街頭，吃　可以上上菜館哩。</p>
<p>說到香港的吃，眞是整天廿四小時不停的，天還未亮的早上四時，茶居便開市。利便顧客飲早茶；一直開到十一時許，正午十二時，茶居的午市，西餐館，菜館亦都生意滔　了。不售洒的開到深夜十二時，售酒的開到二時，過一小時後茶　的早茶　又開，這樣循環不息，忙的就是吃。</p>
<p>從香港社會的吃的顧客來分析一下：茶居早茶中的顧客多屬中下階層的人物，外國酒店早餐的客人多屬少年紳士，太太小姐，午上富商，巨賈，大人先生們多上酒家。小商人，自由識　者多上茶店茶室，洋行職員，學生等多上西餐館，飲冰室。下午茶市的顧客多是少年紳士，洋行職員，小姐太太之流。</p>
<p>晚上九時後一直到深夜二時，都是吃的緊張時期，茶居，茶室，冰室，飯店，餐館，酒家……都擠滿了客人。這個時間和正午是最難找到坐位的，每一間館子都有很多人站着候補。有了錢可以來闊氣地吃着亦不是容易。</p>
<p>或許是聽不到砲聲的地方所特有的頹廢思想吧。「吃為上」，「吃了先，然後算」，「吃喝主義」，是很流行，着的風尙。菜館，食物館老板們「笑逐顏開」了。香港有許多間大規模的酒家，飯店，茶居，正加工趕造，準備在　層新年前開張呢！</p>

<p>美國為紀念三藩市屋倫大鐵橋和金門大鐵橋之落成，特舉行金門萬國博覽會，喚起世界人士對偉大建築物之法意，開幕日期，已定於本年二月十八日，我當局因為在　苦抗戰中，無暇及此，只由放美華僑組織『革商展覽場總公司』，參加博展，建設『中國村』，幷派代表鄺光銀囘國徵集貨品運美展覽，由於經過的一切情形，已見報載，鄺氏也于本月六八日囘美。</p>
<p>目前距離會期只有一個多月，期間逼近，因此國產貨品運美，已極忙碌。在這抗戰緊張中；國產貨品的徵集，因內地交通的梗塞，頗感困難，所以僅由港滬兩地採集。國員的展覽辦法，大槪是這樣：華商展覽場總公司共有攤位四十幾個，規定了這些攤位展覽貨品的性質招商承辦，滬商承辦的共有九個，港商承辦的共有四個，負責徵集國貨運美陳售。香港承辦的商號有中國國貨推銷場，樂興公司，華興公司，中國茶葉公司，中國手工聯合公司；而綜其成的是錦章公司。去年十二月十日。本月四日，曾有兩批物品運美，但都不是貨品，而是佈置會塲的飾物和戲班什箱等，第一批貨品，是由昨（十四日）上午六時開行的克利夫蘭總統運出。這一次運出的貨品，共有一百九十三箱，値七萬元。</p>
<p>記者昨天到錦章公司棎詢關於國產貨品運美的情形，據當事人說：「中國商人這次集資參加博展，因　資力有限，所以未能盡如人意，而且因為許多特產的出產地受了戰事的影響，沒有辦法徵集出品，所以更感到困難。但是對於這種貨物，仍然積極設法搜維。中國工業尙在幼稚時期，主要的還是手工業，所以道次徵集的貨品，大部是精巧的藝術手工業。在華南方面徵集的，是顧綉，古玩，字畫，和名貴的手工藝產品，另有金龍，銀龍，醒獅，粵劇等助慶，上海方面，則由殷商盧　聯負責，徵集齊備後，運港齊集轉美。關於手工業藝術產品，我們是不容忽視的，這次中國手工聯合會負責微集的福州漆器，汕頭抽紗，都是中國特有的產品，此種貨品運到美國，會使一般工業發達的國家感到手工業的精細和藝術，非機械工業所能及。但因為手工業產品緩慢，所以目前集一批運出後，在加工趕製中的，也將逐批完成運美。將來即使博展會已經開幕，也司以繼續運往，總之，我們這次參加博覽，完全以國產手工藝品為主。又如中國國貨推銷塲運出的古玩和名家字畫，也足以表揚我國固有的藝術』。</p>
<p>第二批貨品運出的日期，聞决定在本月廿七日。會場內除了貨品展覽外，還有節目極豐富的游藝，由現代公司主理一切。將來博覽會中，遴選美麗的中國婦玄祖任貨品的管理，增加遊客的與趣。</p>

<h3>我所期望於中藝者</h3>
<p>— 歐陽予倩</p>
<p>中藝的同志們，沒有一個上三十歲的人，可是都經過許多艱苦鍛鍊，他們身當苦難，一籌莫展的時候，來要求我帮助一臂之力；我不忍聽其流落異鄉，更不忍看看他們各處分散，使一羣比較有着熟練的演出技能的靑年，四分五裂，走到各種不同的路上去，為糊口之計，便將被迫拋棄了他們本身的的職業—所以，我當時經過一晚的考慮，决定了接受他們的要求，答應替他們排戲。</p>
<p>新的劇團成立了，第一次公演也開始舉行，這其間經過一個月有餘，在這期間中，我見他們的生活轉變異常迅速：住的地方淸潔整　，起床吃飯睡覺都嚴格　遵守着一定的時間，排練的時候極為緊張，說笑喧鬧的情形　對沒有。還有可注意的事，就是他們求知慾的增進，閱讀書報，請人演講，留心社會事態，一步一步趨向着針會人生實際的體驗。就是思想方面，也漸漸由幻想向着眞實的追求。</p>
<p>他們常然免不了少年意氣，免不了情感的奔放，可是他們的自治　也　當地發達，他們深深地惑到了生活非嚴肅地組織起來，工作的效能就會減退。最近他們的一切措施，都是出於自動，幷沒有晶麽懲罰或獎勵的成文又規則在管着他們，我不過是從旁贊助提醒而已。</p>
<p>我頗有自知之明，從來不願以領導者目居，以我作領導者的確條件還覺不够，所謂領導者一定是一個運動的中心人物。他不僅要能認識正確的路綫，還要能把握住堅强的中張，他的人格道德學問文章都要能為人表　，要有充裕的精力，明敏的才智足以應付複雜的人事，和艱苦的環境。我淸夜捫心覺得慚愧，差堪自慰的只是那努力不斷的心情，和不甘墜落的信念，我只是一部分的技術人員，一個經驗較多的工作者，所以我之於中藝只　帮忙和服務，並不是在以領導者的資格，在領導他們。他們能在嚴密組織之卜把工作做得好，對於戲劇運動——復興民族，强固國家基礎，改造社會的運動——有充分的貢獻，我當然與有榮焉；萬他一們不能自治，工作衰退，我所有應負的責任也决不逃避，如此而已。</p>
<p>我以為每一个工作者，只要　眞正有作人和辦事的勇氣，就不怕有錯認錯，最怕是委過於人。還有就怕自命不凡，看人不起，這樣便關了求進步的　門有能　減很的危險。戲劇是集團的藝術，非有羣性的人，不能成為好的演員，個人英雄中義的熱頭必須克服。有絲亳自私之念存乎其間便會把目己把事業都破壞了。雖有偶然的成功，往往因為認識不淸楚，便會影響大的成就，這此都是最容易養成的弱點。希望中藝同　能够隨時注意，極力建立自我批判，用以增進能率，爭取技術的最高標準，逐步達到預定的任務，這是最要緊的。</p>
<p>還有一層就是有人以為　劇若只要是一個演員能够誠誠懇懇練習寅支就行全，不必有文學和政治的修養，這是完全錯誤的。在封建時代，戲子為社會所賤視，他們對自己也多少保持其神秘性。現在時代變了，戲劇直接反映着當前的社會，所以凡屬是一个好演員，必定要能够接近社會，深入社會，豈有一个作社會敎育運動的人，不了解社會情態而能成功的？豈有一个民族的鬥士而能與政治絕緣？因此便可知中藝同人應當如何建立他們的基礎。不僅中藝，就是其他的戲劇團體也是一樣，這是新時代武裝工作者所公認。</p>
<h3>抗戰戲劇的一枝新軍　中華藝術劇團訪問記　歐陽予倩先生一席談</h3>
<p>— 秋羅</p>
<p>時代表永遠向　　進的，時代的警鐘，也不斷在我們耳在敵，時代是不讓『腐化』存在的，因為『腐化』會阻掣時代的進行。中國今日，是臨到復興的偉大的時代了，同時也是臨到危險的可怕的時代了，然而我們是不肯讓中國沉淪的，相反地，我們將極力支持，支持祖國的光榮的　後勝利。我們是戲劇工作者，在今日，是應該怎樣用忠誠　純潔的良心，英勇和吃苦的精神，去從事抗戰劇戲的廣泛促進，廣泛開展。</p>
<p>作為抗戰話劇的一枝新軍——中華　術劇團。我們期待它，正如期侍抗戰勝利一樣。誰都知道這一枝新軍，是從『中旅』分出來的。關於『中旅』的　身，我們現在是舊話不重提了。從今天起，我們正視着中藝，我們不放鬆它，因為寬容和弱愛，往往會害了事與人的前程。我們的態　，將和歐隊予倩先生一樣，是以理智來决定的。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生的第一句話是：「要修養，要學問，要生活淤肅，一反從前以演戲為　戲的任性，從速養成政治的自覺。」所以中藝劇團的團員，現在有了讀書會與座談會的建立。前後　請過許地山，陶知行，胡春承，徐悲馮等先生輪流演講，還從事政治經濟的研究。而生活呢？現在從七時便起床，一直排戲排到夜晚，排了一個，再來一個。企圖在演出方面，得到進步的效果。從前的不良習慣，都一掃而淸，重新做起。</p>
<p>歐陽先生的第二句話是：「團員將以點計新，團員間的點數，不能相去太遠。成績超特者將獎勵增點，但仍平行為原則。』這就是團員與團員間，祗要努力，一樣看待。至於增加成績超　者的點數，是寓有獎　的意思。生活幷不單是吃飯，而要與趣。沒有與趣的生活是死的生活。書獃子讀死書，死讀書，讀書死，就是這個反照。幹話劇的人不是如書書獃子的功名利祿的個人主義，而是有羣衆件的，是為羣衆而演劇的。是羣衆之一個，幷不是如書獃子的目傲，以為「鶴立鷄羣」。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生的第三句話是：『數目公開，侍遇一致，中藝是大家的中藝，而不是個人的中藝。』這是怎樣坦白而　直　老實詁。祇有這樣老實話拿去實踐，才使一個團　能够團結起來，發展開去。我們否定獨裁主義者，野心者，奪掠者，因為這種人不配到藝術的領城里。中藝用反—條心組成一個主流，這主流，保持得好，將如鋼鐵的堅實。鐵的話劇團體，今日，特別需要。我們將　誠擁護它，鞭策它，不讓它歪面，不讓它遲鈍。常然，中藝的同志們，會給我們以事實的答復，不會辜負歐陽先生指的苦意的</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生也有一個寳貴的提示，就是，要使中藝不要成為一個商業的劇團。據說：一個商人，曾　願拿一萬　錢出來，主理中藝的營業。中藝同人曾予以堅决的拒絕。這是可紀之一。中藝，算以香港為補充站，必要時，當到內地去。內地可以多上演的機會，演技容易進步；內地得和民衆接近，在組織民衆方面，容易學得一點見識，所以中藝回祖國的懷抱的熱情，時時在跳動，祇不過為時間問題。這是可紀之二，歐陽先生很謙遜地說他不是領導人而是　務人，因為看見中藝同志的熱心，所以加入，別的沒有什麽。歐陽先生再反覆談他是為戲劇而努力，以五十之年紀，以多年之經驗，吿訴後一輩的靑年，世界是怎樣的。那一位循循善誘的師長，態度却如此謙讓。這是可紀之三。</p>
<p>中藝成後，除献演「正氣歌一了外；這一個多月來，他們是團聚在九龍半島的一座小林樓，埋頭地加緊苦幹着，在歐陽予倩先生的指導卜，他們每天都加緊排演着新戲，準備作大模的演出。余了重排中旅在港演出寺的舊戲外，開始排演。準備排演的，「原野」有「擒×記」，「一年間」，「浮尸」，「山賊」，「復活」，「寨上風雲」，「靑紗帳裏」「黑唱的勢力」，等上餘個戲，整天在　戲，作的緊　狀態，充滿着活躍的生氣．因為這活躍生氣的吸引。許多人都參加進團裏工作了—他們起初男團員只有十六，女團昌三人；現在男團員已有上八人，女國員已有十　人！</p>
<p>中墊旣有肯虛心學問的團員，而又有虛心肯敎的師長，前途的開展是意中事，現在，他們將於本月十七八兩日晚，在中央戲阮正式公　「正氣歌」『得意忘形』，『雷雨』，『欽差大臣』等劇，十九姿廿二日在普慶戲院公演在香港。這戲劇僅僅生長的所在，總希望中藝予以開墾的責任，披荊棘，除雜草，使生出花朶，結成果實。</p>

<h3>揭開話劇運動史的新頁</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>從一九二八年起，話劇運動者每年都叫出口號說今年是「戲劇年」，可是事實上，在七七以前，中國話劇運動始終未會「蔚為大國」。經過十幾月的鬭爭的洗　與機動，一九三八的雙十，中國開始了第一屆戲劇節，中華藝　劇團的組織也差不多在那時候，那正是揭開中國話劇運動史的新貝：血做為民族復興年的一九三九，才是眞正的，戲劇年。</p>
<p>話劇因為最能反　現實，所以話劇發展史和民族解放運動中是互為表裏的，只要看在戰鬥的十幾個月中，話劇運動表現了些什麽，就知道在光明開始的今年，話劇運動應該怎樣做了。</p>
<p>從七七到現在，話劇運動首先由陣地改變為運動戰。卽是一般集中在都市的大劇團，和「風」起雲湧的多國團體的戲劇組織，都大規模地，有計劃　分發到內地去工作。這種運動戰，使內地甚至於窮鄉僻壤，農民，受了話劇的洗禮，知道了自己和家國的命運，知道了歷史給自己的使命。工作者間也增加了不少的經驗，而使眞正大衆所需要的，做為人類四分一為生存的血的鬥爭的史詩的戲劇遂以產生。這文化的種子，這啓蒙運動的知道大衆的需要，否定了單純抄寫或模仿歐美的戲劇，否定了　情的知識分子理想的說敎，不只是話劇運動的展開，而是必勝的戰鬥的內素的酵母發生了作用。</p>
<p>其次，話劇運動，切實地把自已的命運和民挨解放的侖運繫在一起，話劇工作成了戰　有機的一部，於是，戲劇武　起來了；戲劇工作者走到軍隊戰場，走進工廠農莊，把解放的福音傳給他們，而軍營工廠農村也開始了話劇運動，這民族靈魂的覺醒者成了大衆自我敎育和動員的最有力的武器。話劇運動從文人偏好和小所　者免識分子眷　的狹小　子中解放，能動的做成民族求自由運動的一環。話劇才開始有靈魂，才開始有血有肉：才開始有生命。</p>
<p>量的增加自然引到　的發化，廣泛的活動的展開必形成理論的深入，新的要求被提出了：適合大衆要求的劇本大量的創作，各地劇運的情的報導與研究，技衛的深人與多樣化方式提供，者是迫不及待而急待解决的。其次在後方或國外僑民留居地的大衆，平時飽受舊　的　帕來的娛樂的麻醉，也需要新的替代物，這新的替代物當然有現實的新內容，可是也需要設度的藝術形式和通俗的藝術技巧。這些，國　的機關與學校可以解決一部份，他們也也在努力解决他。而一個存在於民間的組織，如專門的藝術劇團尤其是必要。</p>
<p>中華藝衛劇團存在的根據更在此；其產生的意義也不在此以外，有人說，歐陽予倩先生在中國藝術界的地們可當由帝俄到蘇聯的史丹尼斯拉夫司基。這就比喻中，藝術劇團將是中國的「英　科藝術劇院」。這以為倒不必。因為歐陽先生並沒有接受到像帝俄時，那豐富的傳統，他的幾十年的藝衛生涯都是革命的，创造的，非学院派的。在現在，他個人的成就也許還沒有史氏之多，可是他服務民族大衆的雄心偉力卻非常健康。中華藝術劇團在藝術上也許不是那樣「標準的」，可是作為全國劇運的一個大「拉雷的力」（實驗室），一個大供應站，許多有力的發動機之一，他的任務不是更重大而神聖嗎？為了四萬萬人，自由而幸福的生存，做為戲劇工作者的，我們應該配合現實，要求增强主觀的力量、大家集中起來，揭開話劇運動史的新頁。</p>
<h3>劇運動</h3>
<p>廣州留港劇人叙會廣州失陷後，留市戲劇工作者疏散各方，訊息頗為隔膜。現在先後抵達香港的己經有好幾十人，如藍白，藝協，鋒社，撓風，春雷，洪流等劇團團　都有。近由廣州戲劇前輩胡　水鐳啓南等發起，召集一留港廣州劇人叙會，已定在本月十五日正午十二時，假九龍彌效道五五〇號朱白水君處（電話五八七二四）作集台地點，舉行近郊旅行，互作話舊，幷聯繫今後各方面的工作。</p>
<p>時代劇團赴澳義演</p>
<p>時代劇團為擴展救亡宣傳，推動澳門劇運，和應香港學賑會回國服務團第二團義籌欵的要求，經於本月力日動員了廿七八位團員到澳門去了！十日晚上，他們便開始在全澳最負盛名的域多利戲　開始公演了，　一晚和第二日的劇目是「雷雨」，賣座力極强，第二晚和第三日日場是「夜光杯」，夜則演「油漆未乾」，以上三天是為香港學賑會回國服務幽及澳門難民而　賑的。從十三日至十四日兩大，是該團自行籌欵的，演出的劇目，十三日為「油漆未乾」，夜為「升官發財」，（卽陳白塵的魔窟），十四日為「夜光杯」，夜仍為一升官發財一，囘港的行程大概是今日吧！</p>
<p>業聯劇團首次演出</p>
<p>本港業餘聯誼社，是本港職業界靑年所組合的，裏面有一個業聯劇團，雖然組織未久，可是，因為參　者，對於戲劇，愛好熱誠，已經有了一次很好的工作表現了！那就楚在本月八日　餘聯誼社成立那一天，他們在孔聖堂演出一齣國防名劇一夜之歌」（凌　著）雖然是初次演出，但　績却相當美滿。聽說他們已敦請名　演蔡楚生先生担任該團總指導，將來的成績，一定今有實很人的進步的。</p>
<h3>這光榮　屬於香港劇運者！　一九三八年香港演劇統計表的前語</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>香港劇運在這一年來，是以一點一滴的量開展了它的新生命，也擴展了它的　領域。</p>
<p>最先使我們不易遺　的是上海海關長征團八一三歌泳隊聯合香港藝』以嶄新姿態連續演出了「塞上風雲一和「血洒情空」，由於它，引帶來了新轉變的傾向。跟着，中國旅行劇團和新奐劇團先後到港，再加上時代劇團以雄穩的姿態出現，使香港整個劇壇交流着與奮的熱潮。</p>
<p>在表面上我們看看到大劇團底公演，點綴着劇壇上的熬鬧，但實　上潛　手下　的小劇團或社團間的演出出非常頻繁的，雖未為人知衆知，但實際上所獲得的效果是非常深遠的。</p>
<p>日子過得快；一九三八年在烽火遍對中過了，在這年頭，香港劇壇的收獲是否可以用語言或文字算得出是疑間，但假如我們用統計式調查全港於一年內大小演出的次數的話，最少，我們可以獲到一個相當　人的數目。</p>
<p>自己平日沒有好好的登記（實在也無從登記）到年晚期間以勿勿數天的時間去調查全港的演劇次數，這工作是吃力不討好的。然而，我維竟冒險地肩上了這担子做了。</p>
<p>相當地驚人呵，出乎意外　全港一年間大小的演出底次數是有着近二百次的數目。但這也祇是巳知的而已，未知的，遺記的，和許多無法調查的還不知多少。最　顯的是許多學校回演出教省略了，這是一件無可彌補的遺憾！</p>
<p>在這統計表裏。我們明顯　看到有下列的四點意見：</p>
<p>在抗戰中我們應動員一切力量去支持這偉大的激流，香港雖然殖民地，為？祖國的最後勝利、我們　應把最有力量的文化工作做成這　流。香港劇運者對這方面是任了很大的任務，每次演出都是抗戰劇本，都是和祖國底鬭爭速系着，這是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>過去香港的劇為少數　術至上主義者所支持着，但抗戰後，這劣根性被淘汰了，走上了配合抗戰底鬭爭，並且利用了不同的演出方法去工作，把羣衆的領域擴大了。不單在戲院裏公演，也不單在會塲裏演出，並且動員到近郊和鄉村如荃灣狗華徑牛池灣等的地方去。這也是値得法意的。</p>
<p>以近二百次的演出中，通俗抗戰底　出是佔了百份之八十，可知這當中通俗劇是潛伏着極大的力量，和表現出新興正劇已深入下層羣衆裏去，以後我們除了極力增加大公演外，通俗的演出是更須加强她底力量的。</p>
<p>次數雖達近二百次，在量上相當可觀，但實際上質的要求太急切了，我們不單需要提增演出次數，同樣是需要在質的要求上增加的，祗要　與質同時並進才是好的印象</p>
<p>然而，無論如何，我們可以目慰慰人也從這龐大的次數中找到許多汁滴和幸艱的奔波的！我們將把握着她永恒鬭爭下去！</p>
<p>這光榮，是屬干香港劇運者！</p>

<h3>彭德懷講華北戰況　續第二版</h3>
<p>（四）河北乎原游擊隊、×人甩快速部隊和騎兵、可其進攻、　擊隊用舊切草刀埋伏地下、利刃　天，以浮士掩蓋、×人快速部隊一到、輪被刺破、無法前進、又用三角訂埋伏地下、釘尖朝天、日×騎兵一到、馬蹄刺傷、不能前進、這個老百姓叫做、『舊草刀戰勝新兵器、三角釘刺傷×馬蹄」、</p>
<p>（五）去年六七月　、唐山五千工人起我、戰勝日兵兩營、奪獲槍支武裝甚多、今天已發展成為一萬多人的有力游擊隊、　戰異熱邊境、朝、山海關、冀東一帶、這件事起義有國共兩黨的同志參加和領導、同時、也有的英勇犧牲了、這個、做『唐山五千工人起義，戰勝兩營日本兵』。</p>
<p>（六）在落後的地區、如山西平陸等山地中、老百姓信念菩薩、但同樣地痛恨日本、　們把小米粉和麵粉做成小菩、照着太陽吃、表示詛咒日本、吃日本小鬼的意思、他們還唱着個歌謠、「七家麵，　家米、家家起來煮日本、你吃胳　、我吃腿、留着腦袋給狗舐、」他們每釗初一、十五、便煮小鬼、這雖然是他們的迷信心、然而也充分地表示了民族意識、仇恨日×、</p>
<p>（七）還有、在×佔城市的游業小販、他們雖然也加入了偽組織、然而仍具有極强然的愛國心、侏定一帶民衆、當你。到他們　、他們會吿訴着說、「人在曹營心在漢、不殺日本心不甘、』</p>
<p>這些事實、都不是一件小事、而是偉大的民族故事、都已經編成了通俗戲曲、在民衆當中廣泛地流傳　、至於華北各關、民衆自發地破壞道路交通、擾亂襲×、封鎖消息、捕捉漢奸、以及積極地帮助軍隊、帶路、輸送給養、婦女送丈夫當兵……等事實，更是不可數計</p>
<p>c各種形勢下的民衆工作</p>
<p>（子）抗日農會與工會、農民佔全國人口白分之八十以上、持久民衆解放戰爭、農民有决定作　、在日×的各種默行下、農民各種抗日情緒益見高、同時、在重租與高利貸欵的剝削下、農民生活最為困苦、政治上沒有地位，要求改善生活與提高地位、也非常迫切、這是誰也不能忽視的、倘使忘記了這個、而要領導和組織農民——那是不可能的、抗日戰爭的勝利、將要依靠農民、在『抗日為第一』的原則下、適當地改善農民生活、是完全必要的、根據這個、去發動農民、才是正確的、</p>
<p>在華北、農民已有了相當普遍的組織、有華北抗戰中、發主了很大的作用、他們對抗日軍人家屬、有了各種的帮助、抗屬地位提高、政府高級官吏前去鼓勵和問候、除了精神上的獎勵以外、物　上也　帮助、使出征軍人的父母、沒有感到兒子丈夫走後中困難、反而覺得是無上光榮、同時、發動家屬寫信、鼓勵戰士英勇作單、更提高了部隊的戰鬥力、</p>
<p>其次、敎育農民努力生產、使其知道增加生產對戰爭帮助甚大、所以華北去年的收成、在我們的收復區內、不但沒有比抗戰前减少、反而嘴加白分之二〇到二五、糧價甚為低廉、六塊錢一石小米、這完全是由於農民的勞動熱忱提高、生產自然增加了、</p>
<p>他如、華化軍隊兵員的補充、有晨民踴躍的參加、不成問題、絕沒有見過有『抽』　『拉』的現象、另外、農民組織自衛軍、担架隊、帮助軍隊作戰，運輸、或鋤奸、對鎖消息等等、在華北四面×人包圍當中、奸人實在難以活動、每經一地必須有路條或信介紹才能通過、卽使沒有路條、　這山溝坡道、過見放羊牧童、也要盤會攔　、我們會得到×人的文件說、會派奸人到五台山一帶活動數十餘次都未得囘音、而被捕獲、這說明了×人的失敗、和漢奸活動的困難、</p>
<p>農民有這樣的作用和成續、我們為什麽不積極發動和組織他們呢、同時、在發動與組織農民當中、我們也根　了抗戰建國綱領、改書人民生活的原則、以抗日為第一、使農民生活當地改善了、實現五减租、或者是二五减租减祖的辦法、是由農會負責把地主請來、開會討論、採取和平說服的辦法、取得變方的同　、多數地主是開明的、知道不减租是不能發動民衆的、這樣、更增漲了農民的抗×熱忱和生產　　、</p>
<p>『有錢出錢、有力出力』、這是合理負祖的原則、可是　外、我們也會聽到農民說、『只要有錢的出錢、那窮人不願出力呢、』這個深切的呼聲、使我們還切感動、所以在　北也實行了减息、過去三分的利息、現在減為一分半、</p>
<p>這種生活改善、農民政治地位提高、槓極性也自然提高、參加抗戰、努力生產、於是補充兵員不成問題、糧食接濟不成問題、</p>
<p>其次、由於農民有了組織和訓練、一受到敎育、民族意識提高、知道凡是興×人有利的他們不做了、所以在河北和山西、農民自動的不種棉花和蔴子油而極糧食、以免資×利用、同時幷增加粮食生　、</p>
<p>可惜、華北工人工作較差、因為大城市和交通路綫被×佔據、工人聚集地喪失、不過、　山　其他手工業工人、仍有相當組織、且工人在抗日戰爭中最能表示其堅决與毅力、如六河溝、井陘煤礦工人自動炸燬礦廠、唐山五千工人武裝起義等都是、</p>
<p>（丑）靑年學生工作：</p>
<p>除一般的抗文組織如救國會、抗日聯合會等而外、另外組織有：</p>
<p>（1）歌詠隊：普遍華北各地、歌曲內容都是抗戰救亡的、現在華北各個收復區內、工人、農民、婦女、不論幼童肯年、多會唱救亡歌曲、代替了過去的浮詞小調、這實在有助於抗戰動員、</p>
<p>（2）戲劇隊：化裝演講、如『八百壯士』、『亡國恨』、『抗戰必勝、建國必成』等劇、普遍　演出、揭發×人各種暴行、　定抗戰勝利信心、以及社會許多公益事業、生產動員之鼓勵、都有很大的收效、並且提高農村文化水平、</p>
<p>（3）組織警字運動小組、分佈各鄉市、担任工人、農民、婦女、兒童等夜校識字敎員、推動識字運動、減少和漸次做到消滅文盲、這不特對抗戰有益、目養成靑年學生替社會義務服務的良好習慣、和增加對　戰的責任心、同時、這的確也是靑年學生所願意的、</p>
<p>（寅）婦女工作：</p>
<p>（1）婦女工作的重要性：婦女佔中國人口之半數、有二萬萬之多、大多數還是被束縛的奴隸、雖然政府公佈了些條文、然而那還是非常空洞的東西、所以中國大多數婦女、不止政治上落後、經濟上也無權利、和無受敎育的機會、持別在華北、還束縛在裏小脚的惡習中、更為可憐、這　的束縛下、不僅活的不能解放、卽使迷信的說、死了也是一個被來縛的鬼（指包小脚）、</p>

<h3>麗華杯華聯入選　總會表示不滿意　指南華食言不調球員歸來參加　林中浩昨急電西貢請兵</h3>
<p>〔本報專訊〕麗華杯足球初賽二幕華人聯隊對海軍　隊、經足球總會決定於本月廿二日在香港會場舉行、此項比賽的門票收入、全數歸總會所有的、</p>
<p>當今球隊、以南華最叫座、此次該隊征言期內、島上球事、為之減色、</p>
<p>該隊在　動　征貢前、例須將此事報告總會、得其批准、乃可成行、</p>
<p>事前　總會誠恐南華征　、未能趕及廿二日以前歸來、因為兩全其美計、切實向南華聲明、無論如何、　時須先調幾位　員返港、以應麗華杯初賽、不得藉故推諉、南華亦經慫允、蓋此軍生意經、若華聯前無多數南華球員入選、則號召不大、收入不佳、故無怪議會頗慮及此、</p>
<p>日前、南華領隊莫愛寄回空郵、述及陳德輝麥紹　二人、被越方主人　留於十五日作義賽、勢難中途亂隊、此項消息已誌　、</p>
<p>經　方面得悉此事、及華聯所定人選、極不滿意、指南華食言、聽說屆時南華如果沒有幾個球員調回參加麗華　初賽、則總會他日將不批准招待星洲中華隊來港比賽的請求、</p>
<p>因此、昨午南華足球部副主任林中浩、急電西貢、向莫領隊請兵、此事如何、且待下回分解、（球場太歲）</p>
<h3>東方小勝九龍會</h3>
<p>東方九龍會兩中組足球隊、昨日下午四時、會帥　香港會場、九龍會雖　營遠征、似失地　、　諸將個個振刷精神、若存必勝決心、幸東方各將、　戳力一心、矢中從事、結果、東方卒以守攻略較對方為優、以一比零之戰績、奏凱而歸、檢討兩方球員技術、則東方之劉顯漢、　華國、劉　讚、均日見進步、羅偉權、曾　雲、侯澄滔　亦表演佳妙、其次如李德祺、許竟成、吳祺祥、陳炳士、克盡厥職、祇惜宋　勝因傷缺場、新任後衛之曾佐治、又屬久荒戎傷、實力未免略減、致幾次累事、幸三軍用命、始得化險為夷、九龍方面、中衛綫實行最強、卑利士、卑路二人、表演出色、守將劾　、亦搶得法、前　五員、頗見兇悍、惜聯絡較差、射門欠凖、故卒無法扳成和局、戰情略紀如下、</p>
<p>戰幕一啓、兩軍即拚命廝殺、你來我往、煞是可觀五分鐘後、侯澄滔沿邊急進、旋急踢傳中、落點最佳、異德　、　祥來遲一步、大好機會、失諸交臂、九龍反攻、諸　衝來、有若排山倒海、竟成、祺祥、但京救駕韓尼波連射兩次、皆為顯漢眼明手快、先後兩險球撥出、未幾、東方又被迫至兵臨城下、　亞臣　門發射、球疾如矢、在座莫不為東方危、不料球竟中門柱、反彈而出、始　不失、時極、一脚踢回中央、東方此時亦竭力反攻、德旗一人擊中、急于百步外、施放冷箭、向門射去、劾利因站出過、球遂脫手回後落、滾入綱內、劾利再救不及、九　負後、數次反攻射門皆失利、未幾半場告終、</p>
<p>休息既過、東方頗見活躍、澄滔單力、急如電掣、惜最後　着、高踢成　　、九龍佐芝、　諾士攻門無功、炳士闖進要地、衣化力士來截、亦被盤過、情勢最佳、惟劾利及時出救、此後雙失地、惟願與心違、結果東方以一比零獲勝、雙方陣勢如下、</p>

<h3>梅芳大破培道　冠軍已是囊中物　港大梁文華缺場敗於思思</h3>
<p>（本　特訊）普通界女子等球賽、經過了　宵的　奪、冠軍賣座、已是梅芳的囊中物了、</p>
<p>培道大敗、不是敗得不值、因為它一方面固然是因為劉晴彩手　缺場、以致後防力簿、同時劉奕隱羅少西的演出、實在反常、聯絡散渙、這亦是它失敗的重要因素、</p>
<p>昨晚球迷真多、整個籃球房都給他們擠滿着插身不下、單獨培道到場助威的啦啦隊、統計共有百來　、真是盛況空前了、</p>
<p>第一場港大對思思、港大方面、為着文華缺場的緣故、實力反比思思弱些、所以接　之下、盡走下風、而思思方面、黃勤芳韋寶、演出都算不　、結果三十比十六、思思奪了兩分而返、</p>
<p>第二場戰事、　啦啦隊的喊聲和掌聲此合中開始、首先、梅芳趁着培道還未犯境的一煞那、由活潑得像隻小鳥、　蓮　開紀錄、佔先一陣、許久、培道才由許英華敬回　　、經過這　　的攘奪後、兩方的績分、依然相差不遠、一節終成八比七、梅芳佔先、</p>
<p>二節許英華趁着陳惠卿犯規之便、罰進一球、打個平手、這時培道的啦啦隊很為高興、高唱預祝勝利的歌、可是歌聲未了、梅芳又佔優勢、黃寶珍葉美蓮、相繼加上三點、這樣直至這節終　、十九比　培道績分相差更遠、</p>
<p>下半場伍煥英演出很妙、亦步亦　、　住素以投籃凖確見稱的到奕隱一籌莫展、陳惠卿也不差、而前鋒方面、　美　卻像朵花胡蝶一樣、左穿右插、令人難于捉摸、同時　　　、盧惠嫻、　出也很好、培道方面、曾　徵雖然也很努力、爭奈關淑貞未能監視葉美蓮、時有顧　失彼之嘆、前　許英華雖然取分最　、但可惜她精神太過　緊張、以致失機不少、至于羅少茴、　奕隱、為着梅芳的後衛猛力糾纏、演出未見好處、所以戰至這節終　、培道仍不免以十二比二十　屈居人下、</p>
<p>末節、培道各將雖依然努力、頻頻向着梅芳的陣地作總反攻、以圖收復失地、但梅芳名將并不放棄、投桃報李、互有往還、這　、培道還得啦啦隊、吶喊助威、奈時間一經很少、所以戰至收場、培道乃以廿二與卅五之比、敗下陣來、而大好錦標、梅芳　得了、（籃底人）</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂…社會暴徒</p>
<p>The　Last　Ganaser</p>
<p>愛德　魯濱孫、扮演一個為非作歹的暴徒、在他過往作品中的成功、證明他是一個　出的人才、他那出神入化的演　、刻畫人微的性格表演、博得了每個觀眾異口同聲的讚許、</p>
<p>在本片中、　再師一個無惡不作的暴徒、殺人越貨頑視國法、更　縱着整個社會的惡勢務、叱詫風雲、　橫放縱、不可一世、而終為着賢妻　子的緣故、犧牲一切、以及自由的性命、得到一個極　慘的下場、</p>
<p>愛德華在本片中的演技、處處迸着人才的火花、有着一種非常的動人的力量、合演的有詹姆史蒂華　絲史屈南、同時在本片中、我們還看到好萊塢一張最完美的賊匪演員表、這一部「社會暴徒」中所有的　張動人的情節將給與觀眾大量而強烈的新刺激、</p>
<p>皇后平安……漁船戰血</p>
<p>Spawn　of　the　North</p>
<p>一部由著改編的電影、描寫美國北部邊境、北冰洋上阿拉士加半島、島上　民的生活　加裏是大量「三文魚」的出產地、在以捕魚謀生的漁民們、卻須以絕大的努力去戰勝一切天然為人類的困難、像飄浮海面的冰山、漁賊的猖狂等來維持他們的利益、在他們充滿着悲歡憎　的生活中、有着不少動人心腸的故事了</p>
<p>本片就是敘述兩個好友、因為漁利的衝突、一個與漁賊合作、一個　　漁民自衛團方面、在友變成了仇家、同時在他們背後有着深愛他們的女子、束手　策的、眼看他們互相鬥爭、及後那　海賊合作的、終於受傷而悔悟、故是把賊船撞沉在冰山之下、與漁賊同歸於盡、犧牲自己、玉成愛友、作為本片的高潮點、</p>
<p>本片的攝影技術、活潑巧妙、還有幾個印第安人祭儀典禮的鏡頭、在我們看來、是充滿神秘的意味的、同時本片擁有五個　星、主演的有　治　甫脫、亨利方達、和桃露珊拉摩、并由愛金譚密洛夫、約翰巴里穆亞等合　、情節的編排、使每人都有儘量發揮藝術人才的機會、導演亨利夏樂活、　導演過「松嶺恩仇記」和「抗敵英魂」等片、對於本片的情節與及高潮點的處理、很有縱觀眾情緒的力量、</p>
<p>東方……古怪學士</p>
<p>Professor　Beware</p>
<p>羅克自演「不怕死」後、因辱華關係、給我們很不好的影響、　一時沒有片子到中　來、這次的「古怪學士」、在演出上還是同　前一樣的風格、情節是想入非非、也就以農場驚險的地方、他各呆頭呆腦的行動、使人　笑而已、自然這裏也有不少幽默場面和對白、</p>
<p>大華……泰山復仇</p>
<p>Tarzan's　R-venge</p>
<p>故事平庸、述一位探險家欲捕白羅深入　夷、　王串通人士、欲據　白種女人、幸泰山力　、後白女　內熱戀泰山、不復返去、</p>
<p>出絕無驚人之處、遠不及前之「泰山情侶」主角格蘭馬立斯及依蓮諾霍姆、</p>
<p>影星……雛燕鳴春</p>
<p>Love　And　Hisses</p>
<p>音樂歌舞片、由西蒙西蒙西、華陪溫　　及彭　　主演、是西蒙第一張唱歌片、演出上不見成功、歌喉亦不動　、還是播音台報告員　新聞記者的鬥法、卻相當使人發笑、</p>
<p>中央……情天血淚國語片</p>
<p>是以　探的原著改編、由　萬蒼導演、可以說是駕輕就熟、　主角仍由金燄担任、祇女主角及　隊的配角是　　由袁美雲及梅　等替代了、</p>
<p>故　簡單一句說來、就是　寫一個在封建社會圖掙　而取　終以自我犧牲為了結一生的　性、</p>
<p>在演出上、可以說是滿意作品了、就是那　「可愛的母親」歌劇、因為太長、袁美　、海　出都不差</p>
<p>新世界……春情烈火</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>此片敘述一人飯店內之黑幕、　奇百怪的社會動　、　露社會　畸形發展、看了有莫大之感觸、此片為正義公　之第一次出　、　星　山笑及　雲裳主演、</p>
<p>太平……粵劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>
<p>日演——慾禍</p>
<p>夜演——難測婦人心</p>

<h3>海灘上</h3>
<p>— 彭成慧</p>
<p>伸展在前面的，是一片白茫茫的，沒有涯際的海。</p>
<p>晴朗的長空，一碧萬里，沒有半點雲　，陽光是那麽明媚的射在海面上，輕微地蕩着連接不斷的微波，映着這麽灼然的光輝，彷彿是成千累，的銀塊，燦爛得幾至眼晴為奪。</p>
<p>天氣是一片的和平，一團的溫暖，遠眺海量是無限美麗：白烏三　，晴蜓　水似的上下飛翔。白帆幾片，很優的在上面飄浮，偶然也有一二雙冒着濃烟　火輪駛過，舟後泡沫沸騰，成一烏道，可是　迅速的，一刻間就在波影中消失下去了。</p>
<p>後面是一片　延的山嶺，很濃郁的長着松樹，不時有一二聲鳥歌的淸唱。半山裏是一條夾在中間的，通到靑山去的馬路，時常有巴士在上面疾馳駛過。</p>
<p>他　自一個的坐在這海灘上，靜悄悄地凝視着前面的海。</p>
<p>輕微的風，悠悠吨吹着他的長　，掀起他的衣角，他感到一種寒意。</p>
<p>他流落香江，整整一年了。在這長期的流工線上，他從沒有接到關子故園的消息，他在這裏沒有朋友，沒有親戚。十二個月的光陰，似乎完全是在這島上過去。</p>
<p>他默然地想着，太陽照在他的身上，他覺得非常温暖，他隨卽闔上雙目，枕首石上。很　　的，　的心魂囘到故園去了，他聽到鳥歌的消唱，落柴的蕭索，那是屋後松林秋天降臨的音訊，楓葉紅了，映着日光，鮮明耀眼，還是那麽美麗的富有詩意。有許多片已飄落到階前來了，流水嗚咽，彷彿有人私語，那是門前山巖　漏出來的泉流。池塘乾了，塞滿淤坭，蓮莖還是挺拔的堅立着，前面的湖，靜靜地躺着，像在睡覺，沒有人煩擾　的淸夢，蘇堤的垂揚，像在着細心思里，一聲不響　垂頭。南高　北高　，遙遙相對，在　朗的岩空下，似乎在點頭微笑，驕矜它們的崇高　大。靈隱寺繚繞着香煙，一縷一縷的，雜以鐘聲，還是那麽的莊嚴壯麗。</p>
<p>湖光山色，在靜定的朝氣裏，在綘色的展光中，其美無極，啊啊這可愛的故鄉、是何等的明媚啊！</p>
<p>夢　一滅，他立　意識地醒轉過來，張賬一望，他發現到自己依舊是躺在陽光下的海灘上。</p>
<p>他記得很淸楚：他是在杭州陷落那晚從火線中逃出來的。他本來有一個仁慈的母規，和一個和藹的父親。他還有一個大眞的弟弟，和活潑的妹妹，因為逃走時的，惶，擁擠，和倉卒，所以他跟他們隔散了。為了當時炮火的猛然，軍情的亂混，他始終沒有找尋他們的方法和機會，因此他只得　着熱淚獨自飄流了。</p>
<p>啊啊—明媚的，可愛的故鄉。此時一定還是充滿豺狼似的獸兵吧？湖先山色，在他們猙獰的面目下。一定是嚇得黯然無光了。田園　野之間，也許還堆滿着我們勇敢的戰士的白骨，任風吹日晒，雨打霜侵。有誰能够去盡吊他們呢！門前一株芙蓉，想已盛開着鮮艶的花朶了，桂花的查氣，想也巳四處飄散了，　園的寒物，不知還　當年一般的爭妍否？也許一切都已毀於燹火了。</p>
<p>他想看，覺得過去的一切，都是一個甜密的夢。他不知這何年何日，他才有重，舊夢的機會。</p>

<p>居住在澳門的人，除了賭和吃喝以外，似乎便沒有什麽生活的享受了，其實和東方蒙地卡羅的名稱媲美，澳門　還可以　作東力羅馬的，敎堂和十字架隨原可見，一到禮拜天，山頂中內朴海邊，到處　漾一片靜穆的鐘聲，信徒們底淸　的歌唱使人迷惑了；敎堂頂的十字架發若光輝，人們　　級上慢步魚進那些西洋式或意大利式建築物的大鬥，這情景，卽令在想像中，就己覺具莊嚴神聖，和富有　舊的情趣了，中世紀的繪盡的索　，無論在街頭或　巷間，是往往能够訝然發現的。</p>
<p>我住的地方鄰近一個山　的敎堂，晚上臨睡，關了電燈，讓房了變成了漆黑，而伏在　上凝思的時候，敎堂的晚鐘，就任如晴天一劃般響起來了，聽到道　蕩在萬　俱靜中的聲昔，心靈非常愉悅的、於是像接受了誰的撫慰般酣然人夢了。</p>
<p>從住處往海邊　不怎麼還的，於是無論在淸晨，黃氏或晚上，我絲愛啣一枝杳烟，往海邊獨步，紫荊樹掛滿了枯黃的葉子，偶然也有一樹紅花。然而已禁不住冬寒之感了。海寂寞地躺着，漁船寧靜地靠在海心，讓斜風細雨掠過它的帆。再遠些便是一個一個的小山島嶼，近肖港的大庾山也隱的可見，這山之中，發現有微細的小黑點，×××××××××××××××××？這兩天，他們的什麽艦來拜會了，禮炮燒得震天價響，賭塲，舞場，路上，無處不看見這　昂然不可一世的醜類，幷且還是穿着制服哩！</p>
<p>冬日底雨像是川流一樣又是別驍情　的，由此我記起了一個時人的詩句：「梅雨霏霏急流的最上川」，多麼豐富的生命力和生活情感呵—從堤岸西行，一路上看見的　宇，拚合着各時代各民族的娃築風：有流線型德國的工人家庭組合式的住字，中國人不三不四的洋樓，西洋人的屋　喜歡油漆橙黃和草緣，但尤其使我　好的，乃是兩棟南歐風的小宅子，門前玲瓏透　的六角燈，園裏的菊花和散日葵，屋旁擺着的幾把籐交椅，一條小哈　躺在地上，瞪圓了眼睛看人，恍惚說：『主人們剛談完了心，現今是囘到屋子裏喇』的神氣，人若看見了這此勻　的配合，　得有說不出的柔和，幽美。設想在夏夜，洒遍了銀光的憲下南歐人不會懷抱着六弦琴。低唱一曲情歌麽　難怪和我同來的兩個畫家，禁不住大呼要租來當畫室用了。</p>
<p>澳門是値得你留戀的，倘若你不是一　賭徒，一個俗物。街上的人們幷排地走在馬路中心，無須乎如走香港馬路般提心吊胆，你將　因此而憶起夜間雙門底之漫步吧？我底話說到這裏也就不得不止停了。</p>
<h3>文藝的教育性</h3>
<p>— 文俞</p>
<p>旣然說作家是「人類的靈魂技師一（一史太林），那麽文藝就得是人類靈魂的恩物吧！文藝引導人們去認識現實，變革現靚，喚　一個共通的意識，使人們從事共同的　爭。為的是作家「必定是經常　處在一個猛烈而且革命的和現實的　爭狀態中。因為他必須想法改變現實，所以他是革命的」（福期脫），故此他的痛苦的所產——作品——是具有了對現實的深切認識，現實的批判，與解决。作家從這地方把這咚些有血的有肉東西献給他們的讀者羣，必然地生發了對羣衆的感應力，影響他們的行動。</p>
<p>『這是必要的書。許多人無意織地本能地參加了革命運動，現在他們讀了『母親』，感到于自己非常有益，是非常適合時宜的書」。對高爾基的「母親」，列寧是這樣評價着。</p>
<p>高爾基在一九〇五革侖天敗後的反動時代，制作了「母親」，吿訴工人們以偉大的信仰，勝利的確認，所生的敎育意義的收穫是超過許多的　他的手段，去把工人們　定起來組織團的，這是藝衛的　高息義。「母親」成了一必要的書一，「是非常適合時宜的書」，從這，我們可以明白一個作家，是如何才能站在自已的岡位，如何才能發揚文藝的武器　配合戰鬭。</p>
<p>那麽，在這神聖解放鬥爭中，政治的目標要求動員全民族抗戰，文藝就不能不作為敎靑民衆，組織民家的手段，或許說文藝只成為政治的尾巴嗎？不是的，不過我們先後使文藝在得上抗戰的速度，而且文藝是要組織民衆的靈魂，有着鼓動性，同時還是要巨大的敎育性，對民衆可糾正其觀念，信仰可加强，知識可注　等。題的解答；是靈魂的改造，使文藝于抗戰在在是「必要的」，是「最適合　宜的」。因此文藝要有巨大的敎育性，我們的的「靈魂的技師」，要注重敎育性的文藝。</p>
<p>拿一篇小說來談談。張天　的「王疤臉和小朱」（自由中國第三期）這小說裏，王疤臉是一個老兵和只有「不管的天項地的蠻勁兒」，他的戰衛是「衝萬能」在戰塲當然就是最勇敢的戰士。而相反的小朱是勇敢而機智。在戰塲中，王疤臉就愛成一個一有勇無謀」，不能忍耐的戰士，因不　體會和達成戰術的要求，徒然的受傷流血，索不回代價，而小朱就恰恰相反。</p>
<p>這雖然不是很成功的作品，而作者的意思是希望達到一種敎有任務的，因為在「敵强我弱」的現在的軍事狀况下我們自然要不惜犧牲的决心，但是燥急輕進，或是「拚死主義」等等，足使犧牲來得不値得，我們却要避免，作者把這一點用形象去表現，使它活生生地使人家去理解去體會，不得不說是有着對士兵的敎育的意義，這不過是小小的舉例，而所要求的有許許多多，如教育士兵對子民衆的愛護和如同與民衆携手，建立軍民良好的新關係；帮助士兵去認淸敵人的慘點和　點；和其他對戰鬥有裨的指示等等，自然，這是可以　用其他地方法去完成的，但文藝工作者却不能漠視他的必要的任務。</p>
<p>在後方，文藝就應當更廣泛的有效的發揚它的敎育作用了。文藝工作者　集中注意力去看透各階層各羣體的人們的靈魂的深處，看準他們的弱點的所在，然後以一個『靈魂的技師』的眞姿態，去施以「針炙」的工夫。表面上谷個人有各個人的獨特的對干抗戰的問題，自然無從一一加以解答，但我們所靠類的工作是刻書一典型」，也就同　是扶得許多問題的核心的解答。藝術一定是經過分析，經過旣括，綜台。例如目前×人企圖施行懷柔手段，向我民衆施以　騙和誘惑，有些民衆因而會减弱了對×人的仇恨。這就是當前的一個重大問題，我們應如何粉碎×人的陰謀呢？我們應如何針對某些民衆的這動搖而施以療治呢？文化工作者不能忽略，文藝工作者就更應該發揮文藝的敎育性，把這任務扣負起來了。</p>
<p>文藝的敎育性是隨着抗戰的發展而發展的，隨着現實的各側面的變動而變動的，是多面的，是常新的，因而也是持久的，機動的。</p>
<p>不過，橫在當前的一個實踐的問題，是文藝大衆化　題，雖然通俗化利用奮形式等的理論的提供，已是相當豐富，但是實踐上　太落後這不但使文藝功用性無法高廣發揚，同時使通俗化的問題的本身也蒙受不利，理論指導實踐，而實踐可以反作，干理論，這種反是重要的，沒有實踐就無從實證和改進理論，因此，文藝工作者不能一刻把視綠離開這問題。</p>
<h3>在吳家巷</h3>
<p>— 人甬</p>
<p>三年前我離開巷了吳家。但我並不苦　着她，因為江灣也未始不美，我可以從現實的環境裏找出眞味來，又何必無聊　追戀過去呢。</p>
<p>但是，現在我却濃烈地追戀過去，在一幅幅回憶中，美麗的吳家　便爭先湧浮上來。我深深地追憶着她，有時在淸早，有時在深夜。</p>
<p>吳家巷有特具的美。是活生生的美，那裏有五白畝光景的土地，那裏有數不淸的一羣靑年男女，我們之中，有鐵牛一般的漢子，有木蘭一般的少女，我們底小弟妹，却還是乳臭沐乾的稚子。年長的，是破舊的學生裝和靑布的旗袍兒，年幼的，却全是威武的童子軍，裸着粗粗的一段腿，顯黃桃紅色的一張，這是什麽　這不是活生生的美喁？</p>
<p>情晨，是最可愛的一個時光。在晨曦淸風裏，一聲號響，一羣羣靑年從西尚底宿舍裏　擁出來，習慣地排成了一行行。體育敎育在旗　前高台呼喊着，號鼓手一聲響，美　的國旗嚴肅地爬上十丈高的桿頭。塲子上站着千把個人却沒一點兒聲音，每一個人像一根鐵的柱子，向着國旗行最敬禮。整齊，嚴肅，不是活生生的美嗎？</p>
<p>國旗在　頭　揚，雄壯的晨歌聲　着大喇叭怒吼着；「…撫淞滬戰　，戡不平約章，湧心頭熱血潮千丈，何日國威揚，主權張，英才發勇往，上中靑年勇　！……』啊，好一個十足朝氣的淸　。</p>
<p>白天，我們全那忙碌在書本裏，門樓，先棉堂，就是我們鍛鍊腦袋的所。四時以後，這兩座洋樓變得寂靜了，一羣羣，脫去了學生裝，猛向運動　體育館跑，在那裏，就趁我們鍛鍊筋骨的塲所。文，武，那一樣可以省得了？</p>
<p>夕陽快溜向西方去了，國旗漲紅了臉爬下十丈桿頭，英武的號聲叫每一個靑年站着不動，依舊像一根根　的，柱子，保衛着我們　國旗，緩緩地　下行來。</p>
<p>晚上，九百畝光景的土地全那寂靜了，宿舍底　洞發射着燈光，我們伙伴又在與知識拚命了。文，武，那一樣可以省得？</p>
<p>但是，這樣的生活，我已經與他隔離三年了。那一種活生生的美，不時回復到我底眼珠邊，我余視着，我默默　回憶。</p>
<p>回憶，幻想，囘憶，幻想，不覺吃驚起來；現在，十丈桿頭，不知廳着什麼旗兒？立　型的宿舍裏，我們底書呆，鐵　，不知成個什麼樣兒了？</p>
<p>可是，每一個早展，號聲似乎依然在我的耳邊怒鳴，國旗似乎依然在我的眉間　揚，我忍不住唱起矢家巷時底「晨會歌」來，晒台上，我　個兒像鐵柱般站着，獨個兒用力地操着柔軟操，僅　是一方晒台，正等於五百畝光景的廣塲。回憶沒有用，我們需要幹，需要永恆地幹！</p>

<h3>On Our Nation's Wartime Economic Construction —A Summary at the End of the 27th Year—</h3>
<p>(1) Three Principles and Eight Guidelines</p>
<p>The greatest goal of wartime economic construction is to achieve victory. However, economic phenomena are complex and multifaceted. Without principles to guide us, how can we proceed? Therefore, the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, in its pronouncements, emphasized the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People, elucidating the relationship between resistance and national reconstruction, seeing them as mutually supportive. Within the Principle of Livelihood, it vehemently argued that the ultimate goal of Japanese aggression was, in reality, to use military force to carry out economic plunder. Therefore, during the war of resistance, our nation should first seek to maintain agricultural economies and develop productive forces. Secondly, newly emerging industries are deeply and significantly related, directly and indirectly, to the economic power of the war effort. We must exert the strength of the entire government and all the people to strive for recovery, thereby raising two principles: first, to accumulate capital and revitalize industry through extreme frugality and hardship in production; second, all plans for industrial recovery should focus on achieving victory in the war of resistance, eliminating daily differences in position or vested interests and feelings, and advancing toward a common goal; third, in economic construction, the government must, based on the tenets of the Principle of Livelihood, implement a planned economy. For enterprises suitable for state operation, the state shall raise capital to initiate and manage them, ensuring that production is rationalized. For those suitable for private enterprise, private individuals shall invest and manage them, subject to government guidance and encouragement within the framework of the overall national plan.</p>
<p>To ensure victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction, seven categories of guidelines for resistance and nation-building have been formulated, of which eight relate to the economy: first, economic construction should be centered on military affairs while also paying attention to improving people's lives. Based on this goal, a planned economy should be implemented, investment from domestic and overseas Chinese should be encouraged, and wartime production should be expanded; second, rural economic development should be vigorously promoted, cooperation should be encouraged, food supplies should be regulated, wasteland should be reclaimed, and waterways should be dredged; third, mineral resources should be developed, the foundations of heavy industry should be established, the operation of light industry should be encouraged, and local handicrafts should be developed; fourth, a wartime tax system should be implemented, and financial administration should be thoroughly reformed; fifth, banking operations should be controlled, thereby streamlining commercial and industrial activities; sixth, the legal tender should be consolidated, foreign exchange should be managed, and imports and exports should be controlled to stabilize finances; seventh, the transportation system should be reorganized, combined water, land, and air transport should be organized, railways and highways should be added, and new air routes should be opened; eighth, unscrupulous merchants should be strictly prohibited from monopolizing, hoarding, speculating, and manipulating markets, and a price stabilization system for goods should be implemented.</p>
<p>Over the past year, China's economic construction has been in line with these three principles, and economic construction matters have followed these eight guidelines. Therefore, the important aspects are discussed separately to provide reference and discussion for those concerned about China's wartime economy.</p>
<p>(2) Financial Construction</p>
<p>In recent years, China's financial construction has made significant progress. The income tax, established in October of the 25th year, has added an important source to wartime finance. Since the official outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War on August 12, the National Government, to encourage donations for national salvation, issued 90 million yuan of national salvation bonds, fully subscribed, and now sold out. At the same time, it promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Stamp Duty in Extraordinary Times," consisting of nine articles, and the "Measures for Additional Levy of Local Wine Tax and Management of Local Tobacco Silk Tax," consisting of five articles, and implemented the "Provisional Regulations on Export and Re-export Tariffs," consisting of seven articles. With the increasing expansion of the war zone, the customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, which were the main sources of tax revenue, are now able to collect very little. For example, according to the Social and Economic Monthly Report, customs revenue from retained ports in the 27th year is estimated at about 80 million yuan. On the government side, it is necessary to find other sources of funds to supplement this. The methods of raising funds are nothing more than increasing taxes or levying new taxes, raising domestic and foreign debts, and increasing the issuance of subsidiary coins. As for increasing taxes, most of the places where taxes were collected have become war zones, and taxes cannot be collected, let alone increased. As for increasing the issuance of paper money, this would only lead to the disadvantages of currency inflation, disrupting wartime finance more than anything else. Therefore, to cope with this huge wartime expenditure, the only way to supplement it without causing unfair burdens is to levy new taxes and raise national debts.</p>
<p>(甲) Concerning the Levying of New Taxes</p>
<p>On October 28 of the 27th year, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Excess Profits Tax in Extraordinary Times," consisting of seventeen articles, which stipulated: (1) all for-profit businesses, commercial firms, shops, factories, or individuals with capital above one thousand yuan, for-profit businesses jointly run by officials and merchants, and temporary for-profit businesses, whose profits exceed 15% of their capital; (2) profits from property leasing exceeding 12% of the property value. Tax rates range from 10% to 50%. The starting date for tax collection is July 1 of the 27th year, collected every six months, but according to the nature of each industry, it may be collected monthly or in one lump sum. On October 6, the government promulgated a "Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations," consisting of twenty-four articles, stipulating that taxes should be levied on property left within the territory of the Republic of China at the time of a person's death, and on property left abroad by citizens of the Republic of China who have a residence within the territory of the country. The so-called inheritance refers to the inherited real estate, immovable property, and all other rights with property value of the deceased. The tax is levied starting from a total inheritance of 5,000 yuan or more, with tax rates ranging from 1% to 50%, to be implemented on January 1 of the 18th year.</p>
<p>(乙) Issuance of Public Debt</p>
<p>Levying new taxes is indeed a fundamental plan for wartime finance, but the effectiveness of new taxes is difficult to predict. Furthermore, the need for funds is urgent both domestically and abroad, and the construction of the war economy also requires funding. Therefore, in addition to organizing new taxes, it is necessary to raise public debt to supplement resources. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national debt raised amounts to 100,470,000 yuan in national currency, 100 million yuan in gold, 150 million francs in foreign currency, 10,144,000 pounds in British currency, and 10 million US dollars. See the table below:</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the issuance of public debt is the main means of wartime financial construction in China. However, this is not necessarily a flaw in our country's wartime finance. Judging from the financial measures taken by various countries during the European War, there is much to be commended.</p>
<p>(丙) Concerning Local Finance</p>
<p>As for local finances, they are usually very strained. This is even more so during wartime. The methods of making up for this in financial terms, apart from some overdrafts from provincial banks, also have to rely on public debt policies. We are certain that about 60 million yuan has already been issued. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to issuing public debt, local governments are making every effort to increase tax revenue, increase tax rates, expand tax sources, and economize on revenue and expenditure. Taking the financial establishment in Guangxi Province as an example, it is not difficult to infer the financial situation of other provinces.</p>
<p>Regarding provincial finances, tax revenues are adjusted separately according to the nature of national and provincial taxes, and before adjustment, they are temporarily handled as before. State-owned and county-owned enterprises are expanded to make business revenue an important source of government revenue. Land taxes are consolidated by dealing with land certificates. City land price taxes will be implemented. The house tax will continue to be promoted. All kinds of taxes and levies in provinces and counties will be collected directly in principle, and the system of collection on commission and contracting will be gradually abolished. As a principle, administrative agencies will not concurrently collect taxes, and provincial and county tax donations will gradually be handled by the tax collection bureaus. Appropriate additional tobacco and alcohol tax surcharges and business taxes will be allocated to counties for local expenses, and the standard for their distribution will be determined. The addition of various taxes and levies will be restricted, or taxes and proportional donations will be levied under other names. It is stipulated that banks will act as county treasury agencies, and banks will gradually act as county treasuries. Regarding county finances: each county is responsible for urging districts, townships, and villages to effectively assist tax collection agencies in performing their duties; each county is urged to continue to survey land with unpaid taxes and collect donations based on its land value; each county is urged to improve county finance supervision and unify the revenue, expenditure, and custody of grass-roots organizations. Regarding accounting and auditing: the accounting system is strictly enforced; village budgets and accounting are implemented; pre- and post-audits are strictly enforced; on-site accounting is promoted; inspection matters are actively promoted; and attention is also paid to the general survey of the assets of various agencies.</p>
<p>(3) Currency and Financial Construction</p>
<p>After our country implemented the legal tender in the winter of the 24th year, the currency system was unified and finance was stabilized. However, due to political relations in Guangdong and Guangxi and geographical relations in Yunnan Province, the legal tender could not be promoted. Later, on August 21 of the 25th year and June 20 of the 26th year, the currency system of Guangdong was reformed twice, abolishing the subsidiary coins, but the currency systems of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces still could not be unified and the legal tender could not be promoted. However, after the outbreak of the war, the central political and economic power moved into the southwestern provinces, and the currency systems of Yunnan and Guangxi were also unified. Therefore, China's entire currency system became more unified due to the war.</p>
<p>In terms of construction on the financial front, at the beginning of the war, there was the promulgation of measures to stabilize finance, the approval of supplementary measures to stabilize finance, the organization of the joint office of the four banks of the Central Government, and the establishment of the four-bank lending committee. From March to June of the 27th year, the implementation of the general outline of measures for the control of foreign exchange for imports and exports and the improvement of local financial institutions, as well as the various measures decided at the Hankou Financial Conference, were implemented one after another.</p>
<p>(甲) Guangxi Promotes the Legal Tender</p>
<p>When the legal tender was implemented, the current subsidiary coins were prohibited from circulation. The Guangxi Bank took the opportunity to redeem them, and the provincial government's annual expenditure was insufficient, so the overdrafts at the bank were very large, and the amount issued reached more than 20 million yuan, still not meeting the demand. In the 25th year, military expenses were high, and more than 30 million were issued, and the value of the Guangxi currency continued to fall. Fortunately, the state of non-peace was announced, and the provincial government repeatedly requested relief from the central government. Finally, the dispute over the high or low exchange rate between the Guangxi currency and the legal tender had no results. After the Sino-Japanese War in the 26th year, two yuan of legal tender notes were legally equal to one yuan of legal tender. At the same time, in order to consolidate Guangxi's finances and enrich Guangxi's reserves, the central government issued a consolidation public debt of 17 million yuan in December.</p>
<p>(乙) Yunnan Promotes the Legal Tender</p>
<p>Yunnan Province did not start promoting the legal tender until May of the 26th year. The provincial government's pacification office decided to implement the following measures: (1) Starting from May 15, all public and private funds in Yunnan Province will be paid and received in legal tender, and cash will not be allowed to be used; (2) The use of legal tender will be limited to small denominations of less than one yuan in the paper money of the Central, China, and Communications Banks. The old and new silver banknotes of the Fudian Bank will be allowed to be used; (3) Those who hold silver coins and raw silver are limited to redeem them at the Fudian New Bank and its branches and legal tender exchange offices within three months from May 15. In the 27th year, the Ministry of Finance formulated measures to collect and end the US-printed banknotes issued by the former Fudian Bank, limiting the time for one-time collection to the end of November from September 1, but due to transportation inconveniences, the deadline was extended by three months to the end of February of the 28th year, to be handled by the Fudian New Bank, and will be void after the deadline.</p>
<p>(丙) Facilities for Controlling Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the measures to stabilize finance, the funds needed by agriculture, commerce, industry, and mining should still be maintained. However, in order to cope with withdrawals and deposits, financial institutions were originally prepared to reduce loans. Although the China Central Trust and Savings Bank has not been established, the four government banks have always been responsible for rescuing financial panic in the past, so the Ministry of Finance ordered the four banks to handle rediscounting. At the same time, although the supplementary measures to stabilize finance temporarily prevented the outflow of funds, the organization was incomplete and failed to achieve universal results, and it was necessary to manage trade and control foreign exchange. In March of the 27th year, after the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank" in Peiping was established and issued unsecured and non-convertible paper money, in order to protect our country's foreign exchange funds, on March 10 of the same year, three articles of the "Measures for Foreign Exchange Application Approval" and six articles of the "Rules for Foreign Exchange Purchase Application Approval" were promulgated. Later, there were repeated increases. On April 12, the Shanghai Liaison Office was ordered to be established. On April 14, it was ordered to provide cash. On July 7, it was ordered that banks applying for foreign exchange should specify the names and amounts of importers, and the application line should only charge a handling fee of three pence out of six. On June 10, it was ordered that the application for foreign exchange should include detailed items such as the name, quantity, amount, and origin of the goods. On August 8, a fixed order approval system was implemented. The Central Bank Group had foreign exchange sales but no purchases, which was not a good policy. Furthermore, allowing export foreign exchange to circulate in the market had a significant impact on the future of exchange rates, and it should be concentrated in the Central Bank, both to generate foreign exchange and to stabilize the value of the legal tender. Therefore, on April 25, various measures for the control of export foreign exchange were implemented. The main measures include four types of regulations: (1) Measures for merchants to transport goods for export and sell foreign exchange, (2) Types and methods of foreign exchange that should be settled for export goods, (3) Matters for relevant agencies to pay attention to when investigating the production of foreign exchange from export goods, (4) Matters for implementing the "Types of Foreign Exchange that Should Be Settled for Export Goods" Should Be Settled for Export Goods. It is stipulated that exporters should sell the foreign currency obtained to the China or Communications Bank - in fact, the China and Communications Banks resold it to the Central Bank. The types of export goods that should be settled for foreign exchange were gradually expanded to 24 types, and then changed to 23 categories. Later, there were further deletions, and from New Year's Day of the 28th year, they were reduced to tung oil, palm fiber, cowhide, tea, mineral sand, gallnuts, leather goods, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, casings, duck feathers, etc., three major categories.</p>
<p>(丁) General Outline of Measures to Improve Local Finance</p>
<p>Joint lending by the four banks is sufficient to enhance the strength of the central and specially authorized banks to lead financial regulation and industry and commerce, but the organization of local financial institutions urgently needs to be improved, and their capital needs to be enriched. Therefore, at the end of April, the Ministry of Finance promulgated ten articles of the General Outline of Measures to Improve Local Finance, specially allowing local financial institutions to receive one-yuan coins and subsidiary currency notes from the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, but only for handling the following industries related to agriculture and industry: (1) Operation of agricultural product warehouses, (2) Pledge of agricultural products, (3) Loans for seeds, fertilizers, plows, and agricultural days, (4) Loans for agricultural land and water affairs, (5) Acceptance or discounting of agricultural bills, (6) Mortgages of land and real estate with legal procedures completed and continued income, (7) Mortgages of factory assets, (8) Mortgages of industrial raw materials and finished products, (9) Acceptance or discounting of commercial bills, (10) Management, issuance, or mortgage of corporate bonds, (11) Mortgage of corporate stocks with interest paid according to regulations, (12) Pledge of agricultural, forestry, mining products, and daily-use domestic goods. The intention of this pilot project is to encourage financial institutions to move towards agriculture, industry, and mining, in order to correct the past emphasis on commerce, and to make funds fully invested in rural areas and used for production. Agriculture accounts for more than five items. The wartime measures to stabilize finance are passive restrictions, while the outline for the reform of local finance is an active construction.</p>
<p>(戊) Progress of the Gold Policy</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned, the progress of the gold policy, the establishment of British and American loans, and the extension of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement are also of great importance to our country's wartime currency.</p>
<p>Since China nationalized silver in the 24th year, gold can be bought and sold freely, and the gold price is only controlled by the customs gold settlement price. However, gold has the qualification of an international currency material. The more gold reserves a country has, the more it shows the country's strong external purchasing power. Since the War of Resistance, collecting gold in our country has also been an important policy of the wartime economy. When the national public debt was raised, it was stipulated that gold or gold coins could be used to purchase bonds. On October 10 of the 26th year, the Measures for the Exchange of Gold for Legal Tender and the Implementation Rules were promulgated, stipulating that those who exchange raw gold, goldware, etc. for legal tender will be given a handling fee of 3%, those who purchase national salvation public bonds will be given an additional 6%, and those who deposit it as legal tender will be given an additional weekly interest of 2%. On May 1 of the 27th year, gold public bonds were issued, stipulating that those who pay with raw gold and its finished products or gold coins will be issued customs gold bonds based on the amount of pure gold they contain, with each customs gold unit of 60.1866 milligrams of pure gold. On November 1 of the 27th year, the Measures for Supervising Silver Buildings to Collect and Redeem Gold were promulgated, stipulating that silver buildings are only allowed to buy and sell gold and finished gold bars in the form of ornaments and utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, placer gold, and mineral gold are not allowed to be bought or sold. Shops specializing in buying placer gold and mineral gold that do not operate silver buildings should contact the Central Bank to sign a contract for accepting and entrusting the Central Bank to collect gold, and all of them should be resold to the Central Bank and not sold privately. In mid-November of the 27th year, the Ministry of Finance restricted the private transportation of gold out of the country and to the occupied areas, stipulating that gold and gold jewelry of any shape are prohibited from being carried out of the country or transported to the occupied areas, unless specially approved by the Ministry of Finance. Looking at the progress of the wartime gold policy, the greatest goal is to collect gold from the people to increase foreign exchange reserves. In order to strengthen the value of the legal tender against foreign exchange, our country has to try its best to collect gold from the people.</p>
<p>(己) Extension of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement and Credit Loans</p>
<p>Raising foreign debt is also an important policy to consolidate the currency value and stabilize finances during wartime. In September of the 27th year, our country sent an economic mission, Chen Guangpu and Xi Ni Mao, to the United States. After three months, they discussed with the US Treasury Department and private groups, and the monetary agreement was extended and a credit loan of 25 million yuan was established. According to a Havas telegram on December 19, the US Treasury Secretary said that the monetary agreement previously concluded between the US and China on July 9, 1939, allowed our country to use the gold deposited in the US as collateral to obtain credit loans from the US. The Central Bank of our country had obtained this credit loan under certain conditions to protect the interests of the US and China in order to stabilize exchange rates. This agreement, which expired at the end of 1938, is still effective. According to the joint official statement by the Chinese and US finance ministers on the Sino-US Gold Wheel Exchange Agreement on July 9, 1937, continuing the 1936 silver-coin agreement, under mutually acceptable conditions, our country purchased a large amount of gold from the US, and the US continued to buy silver from our country in order to help China increase its gold reserves; and it was proposed to expand the agreed method between the two parties - that is, the Central Bank of our country can obtain US dollars to stabilize the circulation under conditions that protect the interests of both parties. Therefore, the monetary agreement and the credit loan are probably the result of expanding the agreed method. The impact is to further strengthen the stability of the value of the legal tender. Silver prices fluctuate constantly and do not have the qualifications of a world currency, and although various countries have now stopped the gold standard, gold still maintains the function of value storage in international financial relations. The extension of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement has given our country various conveniences to exchange silver for gold to increase the value of the foreign exchange reserves of the legal tender. Secondly, credit loans, whether in the form of currency or goods, directly or indirectly increase foreign exchange reserves and stabilize the value of the legal tender.</p>
<p>In addition to the US $25 million credit loan, the UK has in principle approved a £10,000 credit loan to our country. The first payment was £500,000, specifically for the purchase of trucks and transportation materials.</p>
<p>(4) Other Economic Construction</p>
<p>(甲) Transportation Construction</p>
<p>Today, the western and northern provinces have become the bases for China's war of resistance and national reconstruction. Therefore, our country's wartime economic construction is also concentrated in the western and northern provinces. However, the most important economic construction is the construction of financial currencies, which are used to promote other economic construction. The second is transportation economic construction. After the opening of transportation routes, the materials needed for "war resistance" and economic construction can be enriched, and the supply will not be lacking.</p>
<p>In transportation construction, it can be divided into highways and railways. Regarding highways: there is the Southwest Highway Network, which connects Hunan Province to Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan and other provinces and Myanmar; there is the Northwest Highway Network, which connects Bei Province to Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang provinces; there is the West-North Communication Highway Network, which connects Sichuan Province to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Regarding railways: the construction of Yunnan (Guiyang to Kunming), Sichuan-Han (Qianfu to Kunming), and Yunnan-Myanmar (Kunming to Manyun Town on the Burmese border and Mo-san Railway in Myanmar) railways is especially important. The construction of the Yunnan-Myanmar railway is of great significance for opening up European international transportation and can save travel time between the southwestern provinces and foreign countries.</p>
<p>(乙) Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Construction</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, efforts were made to adjust the domestic economy, especially those related to the state. On December 22 of the 26th year, the National Government promulgated the Wartime Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations, which were managed by the Military Commission. A Trade Adjustment Committee was established under the Military Commission, with a fund of 10 million yuan; an Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee, with a fund of 30 million yuan; and an Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee, with a fund of 10 million yuan, all of which were specially allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Over the past year, remarkable achievements have been made.</p>
<p>The Trade Commission is now under the Ministry of Finance and has been renamed the Trade Commission, which focuses on promoting the export of local goods and is carried out in conjunction with the control of export foreign exchange. For example, tea leaves from Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, silk from Jiangsu and Sichuan, palm fiber and fur from Sichuan and Hubei, and tung oil from Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. In mid-June of the 27th year, the Ministry of Finance revised the measures to promote export trade, dividing them into: (甲) Reducing export costs to promote export sales; (乙) Adjusting the market prices of local goods to maintain domestic production. Part A is a remedial measure because the international market is depressed and the prices of goods have fallen, causing export merchants to suffer occasional sales losses, which in turn affects production. Part B is a remedial measure because there is a difference between the official exchange rate and the black market, and merchants demand that foreign exchange be sold at market prices, or that the government compensate them in cash.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee is now under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Agricultural Capital Bureau and the Agricultural Experiment Institute work together. The Agricultural Capital Bureau specializes in handling the lending of funds, and the Agricultural Experiment Institute specializes in improving agricultural technology. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated measures to subsidize agricultural improvement funds in various provinces. Except for cooperative enterprises, all agricultural improvement agencies can apply for subsidies in accordance with this law. The Ministries of Finance and Economics have jointly formulated six articles on expanding the scope of rural loans, stipulating that financial institutions that receive one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes in accordance with the outline of measures to improve local financial institutions, and legally established cooperative treasuries, should make full use of various cooperatives to increase agricultural loans. However, during the War of Resistance, farmers' groups recognized by lending institutions may also be loan recipients.</p>
<p>The Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee is also under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and cooperates with the Resources Committee to consolidate the foundations of public and private enterprises. The former assists local private factories to move from war zones to safe areas and continue operations. It is estimated that more than 300 factories have been relocated to inland provinces with government assistance. More than 100 of them are in Sichuan Province. The latter specializes in various state-owned heavy industries in inland provinces - steel, electricity, machinery, and mining and metallurgy. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs assisted a certain agency in building a large-scale steel plant, which will be completed this year and will be able to produce a considerable amount of steel every day. It also assisted the Zhao Brothers Steel Plant, which will soon be producing. Chemicals such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and Albina will be handled by the Yongli Company, which has experience in this industry. In addition, the National Government promulgated the Industrial Incentive Law and the Special Industry Interest Guarantee and Subsidy Regulations on August 7 of the 27th year, which were handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The former stipulates that those who have international competition in domestic and foreign markets, those who use the latest foreign methods to manufacture, and those who have exclusive manufacturing rights may request reduction or exemption from (1) export tax, (2) raw material tax, (3) transportation costs of state-owned transportation enterprises, (4) granting of bonuses, and (5) exclusive manufacturing rights within a certain area for five years. The latter stipulates that special industries that manufacture power engines, electric motors, machine tools, metal materials, liquid fuels, and transportation equipment may request interest guarantees - 5% of paid-in capital, 6% of bonds, limited to seven years, or subsidies - based on the annual production cost and market price of each category, and a cash payment may be given.</p>
<p>In summary, the construction of wartime agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce is presided over by the Ministries of Economy and Finance and promoted by the three committees with the assistance of subordinate agencies. However, because this construction is based on "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Reconstruction," and due to the confidentiality of the relationship and the brevity of the information, it is regrettable that it cannot be elaborated in detail.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the War of Resistance in North China and an Estimate of Future Developments</h3>
<p>— Speech by Peng Dehuai at the Mingfeng Journal</p>
<p>Respected comrades in the war of resistance, esteemed reporters from various newspapers, and friends from the cultural sphere, it is indeed not easy to gather here today. We should be delighted. Although we are divided into front and rear areas and have differences in our work, our overall mission is the same. At the same time, the cruelty and slaughter by the Japanese invaders are equally brutal in both the front and rear areas. The suffering endured by our Chinese people is the same. Therefore, our work objectives are also consistent: to strive for victory in the war of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Now, I will tell the comrades in the rear area about the situation of the war of resistance in North China over the past year and a half, and at the same time introduce it to all compatriots across the country, the national army, and people around the world, so that the people of the whole country and the people of the world can have a concrete understanding.</p>
<p>I. General Overview of North China</p>
<p>A. Objectives and Overview of Mass Work</p>
<p>A. Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of mass work is to mobilize and organize the masses to support the government, protect the national leader, support the army fighting the war, implement the program for resisting the war and building the nation, consolidate the unity against Japan, eliminate traitors, help and participate in the anti-Japanese army, so as to achieve victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Mobilizing and organizing the masses is to make the anti-Japanese forces more effective and more united. This is not for the sake of any one party or faction, but for the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. It is necessary to develop the mass movement. The front-line troops are fighting the Japanese invaders every day and need a large number of troop replenishment. Mobilizing the people of the whole country to participate in the war in the anti-Japanese army is sacred, but it is also necessary to strengthen mass work in order to have a solution. For the sake of the war of resistance, it is necessary to work hard in the rear to produce and increase production, and it is also necessary to mobilize the masses. Behind the Japanese invaders, striking, harassing, and destroying the Japanese invaders, destroying the puppet organizations, and attacking the traitors, require the strength of the masses. Otherwise, the Japanese invaders' organization of puppet organizations will achieve the goal of controlling the Chinese with Chinese. The wealth of our occupied areas will also be used by the Japanese invaders. At the same time, we also know that the past shortcomings of the Chinese army were that the army was a hired army. If we want the army's anti-Japanese sentiment to be high, we must have revolutionary masses participating in the army. At the same time, the anti-Japanese army must help the development of the mass movement. Only when the masses and the army are truly closely integrated can the combat effectiveness be truly enhanced. The final victory or defeat of the war mainly depends not on technology, but on manpower. If the 450 million people of China are mobilized and organized, it will be a powerful source of victory. Here, it is not to say that the army does not need new equipment and technology, but that the main condition depends on the huge number of the masses. Our insistence on fighting the war for eighteen months depends on the masses. Moreover, the future persistence and final victory of the war will still depend on the masses.</p>
<p>The "Program for Resisting the War and Building the Nation" clearly states that "the war of resistance will surely be won, and the nation will surely be built," but this is not an empty slogan, but requires practical work and hard efforts to achieve. A new China of the Three Principles of the People can be realized. The foundation for this realization and victory lies in mobilizing and organizing the masses.</p>
<p>North China is an important direction for China's war of resistance and the battlefield for the final decisive battle against the Japanese invaders. The war of resistance in the past eighteen months has fully demonstrated the importance of the masses. In fact, it is precisely because of giving play to the power of the masses themselves that continuous victories have been won, a vast territory has been recovered, and the foundation for the war of resistance in North China has been laid. Otherwise, North China might have become Manchuria II, which would be unthinkable. Some people still have misunderstandings about this. In fact, we have very different feelings from North China to the Yellow River to Xi'an, although there is only a river apart. I always hope that there will be no misunderstanding, and there is no need for misunderstanding. Boldly relying on the people, trusting the people, mobilizing the people, and organizing the people is the most correct way.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can definitely say that only by raising the anti-Japanese sentiment of the masses and consciously participating in the anti-Japanese army can we closely connect the army and the people. Only a revolutionary mass movement can produce a revolutionary army. Only revolutionary armed forces can cooperate closely with the masses. Only cooperation between military force and the masses can generate great power. Only by relying on the conscious help of the masses in the war can the war of resistance be protracted and can we overcome the difficulties inevitably encountered in the national liberation war. Only by mobilizing all the main driving forces of the entire nation can we strive for the final victory of the war and have a reliable guarantee that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built.</p>
<p>B. Brutal Acts of the Japanese Invaders and the Righteous Indignation of the People in North China:</p>
<p>In the past eighteen months, the evil deeds of the Japanese invaders in North China have occasionally been revealed in newspapers, but in fact, only less than one ten-thousandth of them have been disclosed. There are many heinous acts that people cannot imagine. The barbarity and cruelty are indescribable. Just taking the burning of houses as an example, from Baoding to Shijiazhuang, a long distance, the villages within about fifteen miles on both sides of the Pinghan Railway were completely burned down. We know that these are all densely populated areas, so you can imagine how many people were innocently sacrificed. In Shanxi, countless people were burned and killed in Qinxian, Wuxiang, Liaoxian, Heshun, Xiyang, and other places. As for rape, it is not uncommon. Even old women are not spared, and children are also killed. These are all things that have never happened in history. It can be seen that in the past eighteen months, especially after April last year (1938), the people of North China, regardless of wealth or poverty, regardless of gender, regardless of age, were daily subjected to bombing by Japanese planes, and massacre, rape, and looting. Between the Pinghan, Jinpu, Pingsui, and Zhengtai railways, there were as many as ten million victims. What a huge and shocking number of people!</p>
<p>However, due to the Japanese invaders' brutality, it aroused the righteous indignation of the people in North China. A huge torrent of resistance was universally ignited in every corner. The masses spontaneously rose up to resist the Japanese invaders, and they created many methods from their own experiences.</p>
<p>For example, (1) In a place about thirty miles west of Shijiazhuang, the Japanese soldiers often went to rape and commit atrocities. The masses, filled with righteous indignation, had the men dress in red clothes to lure them. The Japanese soldiers, driven mad by lust, chased after them. The masses lured them into the mountains, killed them, and seized their guns. This is not to say that the people of North China seduced the Japanese soldiers, but it shows the extent to which the Japanese soldiers were driven mad. This kind of thing has happened several times. Now the people here already have hundreds of guns and have become a guerrilla team. The people called this story "The Clever Trick of Men Dressed as Women West of Shijiazhuang Kills the Japanese."</p>
<p>(2) In Xiyang, south of the Zhengtai Railway, Japanese soldiers robbed the people of food. The people picked up pot lids and beat the Japanese soldiers to death. The people called this story "Broken Pot Lids Dig Out the Japanese Soldiers."</p>
<p>(3) The director and his wife of the telegraph bureau in Puxiu County, Shanxi Province, still stuck to their posts when the Japanese invaders were approaching Jiexiu, thirty miles away. When the Japanese army surrounded the telegraph bureau, the couple chose not to surrender to the Japanese invaders and committed suicide. (Continued on page 6)</p>

<p>Guangxi Province Actively Prepares for War; Militia Reorganized into Guerrilla Units; Bai Chongxi Discusses the War Situation</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin on the 14th of This Month] In Guangxi Province, the areas near the war zone and along the highways are implementing a scorched earth policy. The militia has been reorganized into guerrilla units and is stepping up training. Starting next month, gambling will be banned throughout the province, and special taxes will be abolished.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 14th] Bai Chongxi received a reporter from the New York Times on the 5th. He first explained why he had rarely met with foreign reporters before, saying that he was actually busy with military affairs and not out of contempt for the press. Bai then said: "Our country's stockpiles of military supplies are sufficient for two years. Japan still hopes for a quick victory, but after more than a year of resistance, our enduring strength is increasing. The reason why Britain and the United States have extended credit loans to aid our country is because they firmly believe that our country will win the final victory. These credit loans will inevitably expand and will be used to sanction Japan. Although our ports have been blockaded, the inland areas have been little affected. At the same time, military supplies and grain can still continue to be transported in. As for all the occupied areas, our authorities have properly planned good policies and will never allow the Japanese invaders to develop and enjoy them." Finally, Bai spoke of Wang's attempt to appease Japan and seek peace, believing that the Central Committee's expulsion of Wang from the party and the revocation of his official duties was extremely appropriate. From now on, all of Wang's words and deeds can only represent himself and have absolutely no impact on our country.</p>
<h3>Since the War of Resistance Began, Guizhou Has Sent 170,000 Troops; Southwestern Provinces are Striving for Development; Wu Dingchang Arrives in Yunnan and Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming on the 14th of This Month] Qian Governor Wu Dingchang flew to Yunnan yesterday to meet with Chairman Long Yun. He will return to Guizhou in two or three days. Wu said, "Our country's war of resistance is to win victory through long-term resistance. The southwestern provinces should strive for development to lay the foundation for the war of resistance. Guizhou's various construction projects are working hard according to this goal. In terms of mobilization, since the war of resistance began, 170,000 soldiers have been sent to supplement the army. We should continue to supplement the army in the future. Now the international situation is improving, and the anti-Japanese forces have been further strengthened after Wang left Chongqing. Victory is not far away."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th] Governor Wu Dingchang of Guizhou flew from Chongqing to Kunming this afternoon and stayed at the hotel. Chairman Long Yun visited him at 2:00 p.m. and chatted for about an hour before leaving. Wu told reporters that he came to discuss military service and economic construction matters with Chairman Long of Yunnan Province to enhance the anti-Japanese construction work in the rear area. He plans to return to Chongqing tomorrow and return to Guizhou within days.</p>
<p>Kangbian Adds 30 Counties; Sichuan and Yunnan Revitalize Industry</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 14th of This Month] In order to develop industry, the Xikang Provincial Government has formulated a land reclamation plan to add 30 counties in Ningda within five years, and set up five reformatories to mobilize border residents for rotational training.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming on the 14th of This Month] Sichuan advocates the establishment of Dahua Industrial Company with a capital of 5 million yuan and invites Yunnan to participate.</p>
<h3>The Yunnan-Burma Road is the Greatest Engineering Feat of Modern Times</h3>
<p>[Haitong, London, 14th] The Times published an article today entitled "China's Back Door," in which the author discussed the possible development of the Yunnan-Burma Road. The completion of this road may be the greatest engineering feat in the world in recent years. The National Government can be proud of this. There is no doubt that Japan is now paying close attention to the development of this road. Whether anyone has any speculation about the Japanese actions can be postponed for the time being. It also said that the road is narrow, and shrewd observers criticize that it needs to be greatly developed to bear a large amount of military transport. From this month to May, the goods of the National Government can be transported on this road. It is certain that 100 trucks will pass by every day, carrying a total of 200 tons of goods. The round trip takes 14 days. In the three and a half months before the rainy season arrives, 10,000 tons can be transported. However, it will not be possible to use this road as a commercial artery until November or December. By then, the direction of China's war may have changed again.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Plenary Session Will Seek Further Unity Among the Parties; Discussions of Peace Talks Are Absolutely Not True</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 15th of This Month] A spokesman for the National Government stated to reporters that the foreign rumors that the Fifth Plenary Session will consider peace talks with Japan are absolutely untrue. If the government really had this intention, why would it immediately expel Wang Jingwei from the party? The fact is that the Fifth Plenary Session will propose a deeper consolidation of unity among the various parties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] A Communist Party spokesman told a Associated Press reporter that he hoped that the Kuomintang's Fifth Plenary Session would consider the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party's Central Committee in Yan'an on November 5, organize a joint committee of various parties, and realize the Communist Party's joining the Three People's Principles Youth League.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Sichuan and Hunan; Dozens of Students Killed in Wanxian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The local air defense headquarters recently received a telegram from Wanxian stating that on the 14th at noon, six enemy planes flew to Wanxian to wreak havoc, bombing Daximenwai, Xijiao, and Yimalu and Ermalu, dropping more than 20 bombs. Jiji Elementary School was bombed, and the houses collapsed, killing and injuring dozens of students. Efforts are now being made to excavate the debris. It is said that during this enemy air raid on Wanxian, the enemy wantonly bombed, killing more than 50 students and civilians and injuring more than 80 people. The situation was very tragic. In addition, it was reported that a few days ago, more than ten enemy planes raided Chongqing, dropping 17 bombs in a certain place in the suburbs, killing 3 people and injuring 21. They also dropped 12 bombs in a certain place, killing 4 people and injuring 5 people. Eight enemy planes also sneaked in and dropped more than 10 bombs, killing and injuring 28 people.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 14th] According to Chinese sources, 18 Japanese planes raided Hengyang, causing fires in the streets. The county government was destroyed, killing and injuring 200 people and destroying 180 houses in the city.</p>
<h3>The Southwest Theater Headquarters Issues a Statement on the Southwest Battle Situation — January 5 to 11 —</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 14th] The Southwest Theater Headquarters issued a statement on the Southwest battle situation on the morning of the 14th (January 5 to 11) as follows: (1)</p>

<p>About 1,500 enemy troops near Wanzhi, with several artillery pieces, launched a fierce attack on the positions in the Jiu, Long, and Qiandunshan areas in three directions on the night of the 2nd. The fighting was fierce. Currently, the enemy is still fighting fiercely with us on the Jingting Mountain, Tongshan Changqiao line. Our army took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness in Fanchang and launched a fierce surprise attack on them. After several hours of fighting, the enemy could not hold out and retreated to the northeast. We once captured Junde County. On the 3rd, the enemy troops received reinforcements and launched a counterattack against us. A certain detachment of our army fought the enemy for about 4 hours. Due to the enemy's superior numbers, we are still confronting the enemy in the suburbs of Chenshan. In recent days, our army has been attacking Guichi, and the fighting has been extremely fierce. The enemy is in a state of panic and is in a dilemma. A certain division of our army is advancing towards Yinjiachong. Contact with the enemy near Langshanya has been helpful. In addition, a certain army engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy in the Dailing area, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy suffered heavy losses and was defeated and fled in a panic towards Xuancheng.</p>
<p>Guangdong Front:</p>
<p>The enemy in Jiujiang was attacked by our powerful guerrillas, and the enemy suffered hundreds of casualties. One night, a certain unit of our army launched an attack on the enemy in the Shedoufang area of Zengcheng. The enemy relied on fortifications to resist, and our army pushed forward step by step.

The enemy's military train between Yuezhou and Wuchang was destroyed by our guerrillas, killing many enemy soldiers riding in the train and capturing many work tools, military uniforms, clothing cans, and military supplies.</p>
<h3>We Purchase a Large Number of Aircraft from the United States; Total Value Reaches 8.3 Million Yuan; First Batch of 200 Aircraft Soon to be Shipped</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] According to Japanese sources, the "New York Forum" received a shocking report from Washington that the Chinese government had ordered a large number of aircraft from the American "Blenheim" aircraft manufacturing plant, valued at 8.5 million yuan. The contract has been signed by both parties. The newspaper reported that 200 bombers would be shipped to China in March this year. Each of these bombers is equipped with nine machine guns and can carry seven 300-pound bombs.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] Chinese officials here denied the report that China had ordered "Blenheim" aircraft from the United States, saying that the previous "Blenheim" aircraft were not suitable for bombing or combat. If China purchased this type of aircraft, it must be from private sources. According to authoritative sources, China purchased 20 "Blenheim" aircraft last year, none of which were good combat aircraft. China currently has 99 of these aircraft, which are used as training aircraft.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Officials disclosed today that China had ordered aircraft from the "Blenheim" factory, saying that the aircraft would be shipped to China in September. Authoritative sources said that the aircraft were valued at 8.32 million yuan. The "Blenheim" aircraft manufacturing plant will use this to expand its facilities and mass-produce military aircraft.</p>

<h3>Commander of the ×th War Zone Wei Lihuang Speaks: The Terrain of Western Henan is Advantageous to Us; The Enemy's Attempt to Cross the River is Nothing But a Dream</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] General Wei Lihuang, who has been transferred to the ×th War Zone after repeatedly building meritorious service in Western Henan for more than a year, assumed his post in Luoyang yesterday afternoon. The reporters stationed in Luoyang visited him in the afternoon and were received by Wei. First, he spoke about the Shanxi War, saying: "After more than a year of continuous attacks by our army, the strength of the enemy in Shanxi has been exhausted. The points and lines occupied by them have also been continuously destroyed and attacked by us, and they have lost contact with each other, like isolated individuals. In the past, the enemy often took the initiative, but now they have become passive and are on the defensive. We are active on all fronts, launching night attacks, causing the enemy to lose sight of each other and exhausting themselves. Generally, people are worried that the enemy will cross the Yellow River and invade Henan. If we can understand the enemy's difficult situation and the strong strength of our army, we can resolutely defend the north bank. Our army will be the screen of North China, and the enemy's claim to cross the river is nothing but a dream." He then said: "This time, I have been ordered to command the Henan war. Henan is in the Central Plains of our country, the intersection of the southeast and northwest, and it is related to the entire war. I feel that my responsibility is heavy and my ability is meager. I hope that all sectors will sincerely help. The success or failure of the war of resistance is not a matter of profit or loss for one family, but is related to the survival of the entire nation. The people of Henan Province are strong, and the military force is strong, which has long been known to the people of the country. If this kind of latent power can be used properly, it is more effective than the army. Therefore, this time I come to Henan, I will first develop the strengths of the masses and allow them to fully demonstrate their great effectiveness in the war of resistance. At the same time, I hope that the masses can thoroughly understand that today's war of resistance is not the business of a few people. If the war of resistance fails, no one can escape their doom. He then cited the suffering of the people in the occupied areas of Shanxi, saying: "The enemy army, in order to achieve their vicious plan to destroy China and exterminate the race, forced the people to take dumb injections, making them disabled and used as beasts of burden. China has not been subjugated. Seeing such a painful lesson, we can see that the day of the failure of the war of resistance is the time when we will be reduced to hell and work as slaves. We must have this awareness. The enemy's weapons are stronger than ours, but as long as the whole country is united, we can overcome them with a fearless spirit. We only need to have firm self-confidence, that is, 'With me in the Central Plains, the enemy will not succeed.' If everyone is like this, the final victory will belong to us without any problem." The reporter then asked about the prospects for counter-offensive. He expressed an optimistic attitude, saying: "The terrain in the Western Henan area is advantageous to us. All the transportation lines that need to be destroyed have been destroyed, and the main routes are under our control. With our proper deployment and the assistance of the people, the enemy will never succeed." He instructed the reporter to pass on his condolences to the people of the country. At this point in the conversation, the reporter was very excited.</p>
<p>Japanese Hold Military Conference to Discuss Invading the Northwest</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 14th] According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese are planning to invade the Northwest with General Terauchi as commander-in-chief and General Umezu as commander of the first route army. The Japanese army is divided into three routes, with a total of Japanese soldiers, including some divisions of Mongolian puppet troops. The Japanese recently held a military conference in Datong, presided over by General Terauchi, to decide that the military actions of the Japanese army should not be neglected, so as to avoid slow progress. The Datong military conference decided that before the Japanese army invaded, three points should be closely watched: (1) Observe the presence of the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas directly under the Central Command, which are constantly harassing the rear of the Japanese army. (2) The Japanese are attempting to use the Muslims in the west to disrupt the Chinese army, but this wishful thinking has failed. (3) The Japanese army should pay attention to the tactics of both sides, that is, the important strongholds that the Japanese army intends to invade are defended by a large number of Chinese guerrillas. The results of the Datong conference were that the Japanese army could succeed in the Northwest only if it increased its combat power and mobilized the Hui army. The Japanese army's military operations in southwestern Shanxi last week were aimed at suppressing the Chinese guerrilla units and were not a prelude to the invasion of Gansu. However, the strength of the Japanese army is obviously insufficient.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Relations: President of the Legislative Yuan - Speech at a Reception for Chongqing Cultural Circles</h3>
<p>Don't be impatient. Before Britain, the United States, and France are united, not only can the Soviet Union not act rashly, but we also do not want it to take action alone.</p>
<p>We often boast that we have a vast territory and abundant resources, but in reality, there is a country with even larger territory and more abundant resources than us, which is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's territory is three times that of China's. We all know that after the success of the Soviet revolution, with just two five-year plans, its industrial production has already ranked first in Europe and second in the world. However, we have not seen the Soviet Union pushing any goods abroad, because in fact, domestic production is far from enough for their own consumption. Originally, the Soviet Union is not a capitalist country, so workers' wages are increasing day by day, and because workers' incomes are abundant, their purchasing power is strong, so the goods produced every day are not enough for their own enjoyment. As for domestic natural resources, not to mention two five-year plans, even another hundred years would not be enough to exploit them. Therefore, the Soviet Union's national strength is very abundant. They sincerely hope that China will become rich and strong and have no intention of dominating the Far East.</p>
<p>Perhaps none of you have been abroad recently, so you don't know the recent foreign situation. I have been to several places last year and deeply know that China's propaganda abroad, even done by ourselves, is not as widespread as the Soviet Union's propaganda for us. The newspapers the Soviet Union uses to promote us, one from the government and one from the party, publish news that is beneficial to China every day, and they never publish any news about the Japanese. Why do they do this? It is to let their people know the greatness of China, to know that China will definitely win, and at the same time, their comments also say that China is resisting for the survival of the nation. Therefore, in their articles commenting on China, no matter which article or which sentence, there is absolutely no place that is unfavorable to China. This is not the result of our request, but their spontaneous, great sympathy and assistance. However, outside of the Soviet Union, the United States is sympathetic to China, and Britain and France are also sympathetic to China. But what is the situation in the newspapers of Britain and France towards China? Left-wing newspapers can still promote us and encourage us to work hard in the war of resistance. As for right-wing newspapers, they have different understandings and sometimes express doubts about the future of our war of resistance. They also say how rich and strong Japan is and that China should not fight Japan but should serve the strong with weakness, and that the current war of resistance is too inconsiderate of virtue and does not measure strength. Therefore, looking at it from abroad, the Soviet Union is completely on our side and is indeed our friend. But on the other hand, in our country, there are still several publications that select and publish articles opposing the Soviet Union. When Soviet friends see this kind of writing, they are naturally unhappy. It should be known that China needs Soviet help right now, and the Soviet Union is a country that asks nothing of others, let alone of our country. Furthermore, even if we oppose it, what's the use? As for the Soviet Union's view of China's war of resistance, from the beginning of the war, they said that China would definitely win the final victory. They use a scientific method to observe, and it seems that they see it more clearly than we do. They said that China has 450 million people. If everyone does not have the idea of resisting Japan, then it goes without saying that the country will be destroyed. But the Chinese people are not like this because, after decades of revolutionary thought, the people of the whole country have the awareness of national survival. Even ordinary people firmly believe that they must resist Japan. Now, not only can Japan not destroy China, but even the world's aggressors and tyrants cannot destroy China because they have historical experience. After the October Revolution, from 1917 to 1920, the domestic situation was very chaotic. There were counter-revolutionary factions causing trouble, and at the same time, the Allied powers Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Poland, and even Japan attacked the Soviet Union. From 1917 to 1920, they fought for two whole years, and the Soviet Union responded to domestic reactionaries on the one hand and resisted foreign aggression on the other. At that time, the Soviet Red Army only had Petrograd and Moscow. All the factories had been bombed, the economy was insufficient, and there was not enough food. It was through their strong resistance that they were able to achieve victory in 1920. Initially, the number of Red Army soldiers was only over 100,000, but by 1920, the number of Red Army soldiers had increased to more than 5 million. We must know that they carried out several revolutions at the same time. Internally, it was a social revolution to eliminate landlords and capitalists, and externally, it was a national revolution to defeat the Allied forces' invasion. Compared to China, our problems now are much simpler because China's only enemy is Japan. As for domestic traitors, they have no strength. We don't need to pay attention to them. Currently, the country is absolutely united, and the central government is becoming increasingly consolidated. Based on their historical lessons, they believe that the Chinese revolution must succeed.</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, the army commanded by the central government had only 100 divisions. Some divisions were large, and some were small. The smaller ones had only 5,000 men per division, totaling only 1 million men. Now there are more than 240 divisions, all of which have been reorganized and strengthened. It can be calculated that the military strength is more than doubled compared to before. So, I say that we are getting stronger as we fight. The replenishment of other military equipment has increased several times compared to before the war. These are all true facts. As for combat experience, before the July 7th Incident, our army had not fought a war against a foreign country. Although there were wars every year, they were all domestic wars. Generally, officers and soldiers were influenced by Japanese propaganda and did not know how much strength they had, always thinking that the Japanese army was amazing. But now everyone knows that the strength of the Japanese is only so-so. During the Battle of Shanghai, on average, for every Japanese soldier killed or wounded, we had five casualties. During the Battle of Xuzhou, for every Japanese soldier killed, we had to sacrifice three. By the time of the battles along the Yangtze River, the casualties between the Japanese and us were roughly equal. As for the guerrilla warfare in North China, according to recent reports, our soldiers have to exchange at least three Japanese soldiers for one of our soldiers. In the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi, it is said that on average, we have to exchange fourteen and a half Japanese soldiers for one of our soldiers. With this kind of war of resistance, how can we not say that we will win? In the hearts of the Japanese, they always thought that after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, we would not be able to continue fighting them. They also felt that imports to Hong Kong were difficult, and our military supplies were cut off. In fact, we had long been prepared. According to the current situation, even if we fight for another ten years, the supply of military supplies will not be a problem.</p>
<p>When we withdrew from the capital, some people in Britain said that China's resistance against Japan might be defeated in every battle, but the final victory would belong to China because Japan would not be able to sustain it permanently. We know that the Japanese military plan originally wanted to subdue China without using force, just by mobilizing their troops and demonstrating to China, and China would surrender. But after the July 7th Incident, they knew that they couldn't do it without using force. Initially, the budget they proposed was only for one month because they thought they could solve the problem in one month. Later, they knew that one month could not solve it, so they came up with a three-month budget, thinking that they could eliminate China in three months. Now it has been eighteen months, and they have not done anything to China. Initially, they only sent 300,000 troops, but now they have increased to 1.5 million troops. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to fight a quick battle has been shattered, and now they want to make peace quickly. However, we are still fighting them. According to the recent situation, it seems that there is no news from the battlefield, and it seems that the war has stopped. In fact, this is because the Japanese cannot cope with it anymore because it costs them 20 million yuan every day to fight us, which is 7.2 billion yuan a year. In the past, they have already spent more than 80 billion yuan, and the budget for next year will definitely increase by another 80 billion yuan. Japan's annual income is only 8-9 billion yuan. According to the above figures, their war expenses for one year require the income of several years to offset. From this, the Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi said that if Japan's national debt reaches 10 billion yuan, it will inevitably lead to national ruin. Now their national debt has already reached more than 10 billion yuan. In another year, it will reach at least 25 billion yuan. Assuming an annual interest rate of 1%, the annual interest payment alone would be more than 200 million yuan, while their wartime income is only 1 billion yuan per year. If they use their income entirely to pay the interest on war bonds, it is not enough to distribute. Isn't this a big problem in finance? Therefore, they recently changed their cabinet, and the reason is that they want to implement total mobilization. It can be seen that the Japanese economy is already in trouble. If total mobilization can be implemented, they can confiscate people's wealth. I think that the Japanese economic mechanism may collapse as a result. Even if we continue to drag on with them like this, they will have to seek peace in another year. If they don't make peace with us in another year, they will have to get out. Therefore, the final victory has already been placed before our eyes.</p>
<p>Now that we know that the strength of the Japanese is so weak, we don't need to ask others to participate anymore. In the future, we will defeat Japan alone. Who dares to divide our spoils? Therefore, our future is already very bright. The war of resistance has now been going on for eighteen months. At least another eighteen months will be enough to achieve victory. It's just a matter of enduring one or two more years of hardship. After Japan is defeated, what will be China's position? What will East Asia be like? At that time, we will truly be able to stabilize East Asia and truly establish a peaceful order in East Asia. I believe that this ability is entirely in our hands. Heaven has already given us this qualification, and Japan does not have this qualification. Japan's future survival will depend on our support. At the same time, we will still establish the country based on the Three Principles of the People. Even after the revival, we will still be a peaceful country and will not need to invade others. At that time, although we will be the main country in East Asia, we will still be on an equal footing with other countries. Therefore, creating such peace and happiness is a responsibility given to us innately. Only we can take on this responsibility. Now we have all kinds of superior conditions that the Japanese do not have. First, we have the Three Principles of the People. In the past, there were still doubts about the Three Principles of the People in the country, thinking that the Three Principles of the People were not very new and that there were newer principles besides the Three Principles of the People. It should be known that we must be able to realize a principle we believe in before it is useful. If a certain principle is very good, but it cannot be realized until a hundred or five hundred years later, then it cannot save our emergency. Communism may be the highest ideal, but it is not applicable to today's China. If we do it, we will not be able to do it. Therefore, our friends in the Chinese Communist Party are now unanimously defending and implementing the Three Principles of the People. The Japanese have no principles. What principles do Konoe and Hiranuma have? Although we want to learn fascism, they don't know what fascism is all about. Second, we have a leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is loved and supported by the whole country to lead everyone, while can the Japanese so-called Konoe be considered their leader? Hiranuma is not worth mentioning. Therefore, we are truly fortunate to be born in this era. If we were born a few years earlier, we would not be able to see this era. If we were born a few years later, we would not be able to catch up with this era. Therefore, we Chinese people are the most glorious people in the world. We should be so proud. After these eighteen months of the war of resistance, our overseas Chinese and ambassadors abroad have received such respect from people abroad. I remember when I was eating at the "Shanghai Building" in Paris last April, the owner of the building poured a glass of red wine in front of each guest. At that time, someone asked him why we didn't order wine, why are you pouring wine for us? He said, "Everyone, drink. Because the Chinese army won in Taierzhuang, this is a gift from this building to everyone." So everyone stood up together and raised their glasses and shouted, "Long live the Republic of China!" Therefore, it is said that the Chinese people today are the most glorious people in the world. Now we have been resisting Japan for eighteen months. Which country dares to fight Japan? Although Britain and the United States are strong, they have not come out to fight Japan. Therefore, now is the time for us Chinese people to hold our heads high and breathe. In the future, when we defeat Japan, how much respect will people in the world have for us?</p>
<p>In the past, some students who had studied abroad returned home and thought that everything in the motherland was not good, even that the moon was not as good as the moon in foreign countries. This is belittling oneself. I have also studied abroad, but every time I return home, I always feel that there is no place in the world that can compare to China. Take the Soviet Union, for example. Although it has a vast territory and abundant resources, because of its location, the atmosphere is too cold. Our China is much better. Take Chongqing, for example. Some people say that Chongqing's weather is not good, but I think Chongqing's climate is too good. In weather like today, Japanese planes cannot invade the sky. Isn't this a natural protection? None of you have been to Europe. What is so good about Europe? In my opinion, it's just that artificial organization is a little more than ours, but we can immediately start construction on this point. There is nothing we cannot do.</p>
<p>The largest country in Europe, except for the Soviet Union, if Eastern and Western Europe are counted together, has a population of just over 70 million, and its resources are not as good as China. Britain has a population of 46 million, and France and Italy both have a population of only 42 million. In the past, France's population had decreased a lot. Later, the French government felt that this would be very dangerous, so the government encouraged births, but as a result, there has been no increase to this day. This is purely natural. As for Germany and Italy, they are invading other countries because their domestic resources are not enough to distribute. Our China has abundant natural resources, a large population, and a vast territory. It's just that we used to be too careless in our lives and didn't know how to unite and work hard. Now we use the Three Principles of the People to raise everyone's spirits. Then the Chinese revolution will definitely be successful. For example, Czechoslovakia, before it was divided a few months ago, had a population of over 10 million. Among the small European countries, it was considered a strong country. They said that China has been resisting Japan for a year and can still maintain it. It is truly an amazing country, and they also said that China is not only a country, but also a strong country. And at present, China is already a strong country, but China itself does not yet know it. Now a few months have passed, and we still exist, but where has Czechoslovakia gone? Because Czechoslovakia is a small country, and its endowment is not enough. Some people say that China wants to purchase military equipment. This is a good opportunity. Now Czechoslovakia's heavy military equipment has no chance to be used. It can be seen that our natural endowment is absolutely incomparable to other countries. We should increase our self-confidence so as not to fail our endowment. Finally, I would like to conclude by quoting a sentence from my old friend Mr. Chiang Pai-li, which is "In a thousand words and ten thousand sentences, I only tell everyone one sentence: China has a way."

<h3>Chamberlain Departs Italy and Returns Home; British and French Foreign Ministers to Meet Today; Rome Announces Meeting Progressed Well; Both Sides Willing to Uphold Peaceful Policies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Chamberlain departed Rome this afternoon for London. Mussolini personally went to the station to see him off. The two walked back and forth together inside the station for several minutes, smiling and talking. Their expressions were visibly more intimate than when Chamberlain arrived here a few days ago. Ciano and British Ambassador Perth followed behind the two, also in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>[Haitong, Rome, 14th] Local officials stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain met with the Egyptian and Iraqi ambassadors to Rome yesterday afternoon. At 11:09 this morning, Chamberlain boarded a train via Paris to return home. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, along with all cabinet members, leaders of the Fascist Party, and military and political figures, as well as the ambassadors from the United States, Ireland, South Africa, and others, were at the station to see him off. Crowds lined the streets, cheering loudly. British Foreign Minister Halifax departed Rome at 7:40 this morning for Geneva to meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. After a short stay, he will rush back to London to attend the British cabinet meeting on the 18th, at which Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a report on his visit to Rome.</p>
<p>[Haitong, London, 14th] It is announced here that Duke Halifax will arrive in Geneva from Rome tomorrow morning and meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet on the same day. Political circles here believe that the meeting between the British and French foreign ministers is extremely important because the two sides will exchange opinions on the results of the British-Italian talks.</p>
<p>[Haitong, Vienna, 14th] According to an announcement issued by the Foreign Ministry last night, the prime ministers of Britain and Italy, as well as the foreign ministers of the two countries, held a meeting here. Various current issues, especially those regarding the two countries, were brought up for discussion. Both sides exchanged opinions with sincerity and agreed to abide by the agreement of April 16, 1938, and to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. They are also willing to expedite the conclusion of a special agreement to amend said agreement. It was noted that both countries expressed their determination to maintain peaceful policies during the talks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 14th] There are rumors that Italian troops have been concentrated on the border of French Somaliland. French diplomatic and military circles have heard nothing of this.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Italian Troops Concentrating in East Africa; Britain Decides to Assist if France is Invaded; Germany Also to Undertake Military Actions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Poti, 13th] According to information received here, a large Italian army has concentrated in Modera, Jawliro, and Sado (near Hargeisa), adjacent to the borders of French and British Somaliland. It is rumored that many locals from the Harar province have been conscripted and incorporated into the local army. Upon receiving this report, necessary steps have been taken here.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] According to reliable sources, Britain has today explicitly told Italy that if a conflict occurs between France and Italy, Britain will firmly assist France. Mussolini assured Chamberlain that Italy has no intention of conflict with France, but these "loudly proclaimed" British-Italian talks have clearly failed, and the result will be that Chamberlain abandons his "appeasement" policy. This is because Mussolini has demands regarding the Mediterranean and refuses to withdraw troops from Spain. The opinions of the two leaders on the Spanish war seem to be most contradictory. The Italian prime minister hoped that Britain could recognize the rebels as a belligerent group, as this would block the port of the government forces. The British prime minister repeatedly pressed Mussolini to fulfill his promise to withdraw troops. It is heard that the Italian side expressed to Chamberlain and Halifax that the Spanish war could end "within a few weeks," after which troops could be withdrawn.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent stated that London officials are not paying attention to the German anti-Dutch movement. It is widely rumored that Hitler will take military action, with targets including Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Memel, Danzig, the Netherlands, and Belgium. British authorities believe that Hitler's recent policies have caused panic on all sides, which is regrettable. Although Britain does not have treaty relations with the Netherlands as it does with Belgium, the historical relations between the two countries and the geographical situation of the Netherlands make the interests of the two countries even closer. It is rumored that Germany is intensifying economic pressure on the Netherlands, but there is no official confirmation. It is believed that Germany will not take military action against the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Haitong, The Hague, 14th] It is announced here that regarding the shooting incidents at the Amsterdam and The Hague German legations, the police have thoroughly investigated, but external reports are somewhat exaggerated. The German legation in The Hague is connected to a building not inhabited by legation staff. A gunshot suddenly entered, injuring the person in the room. The police retrieved the bullet. Also, the window of the German consulate in Amsterdam was indeed shot through a small hole by a gun played with by a child.</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Visit Yugoslavia; Yugoslav Officials Say No Agreement Will Be Signed; Deny Goering Will Visit Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[Haitong, Yugoslavia, 14th] On the evening of the 5th of this month, authoritative sources here announced that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will visit Yugoslavia on the 20th of this month, first going to Brioni for a two-day hunt, and then to Belgrade. Officials stated that Ciano's visit is of a private nature, to reciprocate the visit to Italy by Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović last year. Therefore, no new agreement will be signed. Furthermore, the rumor that German General Goering will also visit Yugoslavia has been denied by officials.</p>
<h3>Several Divisions of Spanish Rebel Army Cross the Ebro River; Other Units Also Advancing; Report from Burgos</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 13th] After fierce fighting, the rebel army has occupied Tortosa at the mouth of the Ebro River. Several divisions of Moroccan Legion soldiers, under the command of General Yague, crossed the Ebro River and the land on the south bank, and the performance of the cavalry in this large encirclement operation was also very important. Afterward, the infantry advanced to Piera, on the Valencia-Barcelona highway, located ten miles north of Tortosa. Currently, the three highways to Tortosa are controlled by the rebel army. According to frontline reports, the rebel army is continuing to advance rapidly in all directions. On the northern front, the Ugalde Group, under the command of General Monasterio, is advancing northeast along the Seo de Urgel highway and has occupied Perna and Coll de Ter. Also, the Amadeo Iturralde division, under the command of General Garcia Valiño, has occupied Monfalco, less than eight miles from Cervera. The Navarre divisions, commanded by General Solchaga, are operating from the Montblanc area and are advancing along the highway, occupying Riudavella and the Sierra de Codony. They are only four miles from Valls and its important factories and airfields.</p>
<h3>New York Financial Circles Believe Large-Scale War Will Not Occur, Based on Roosevelt's Arms Expansion Message</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Wall Street figures have concluded two points from President Roosevelt's arms expansion message to Congress. First, that Mr. Roosevelt's request for funds in the 1940 fiscal year is not large, indicating that a large-scale war will not occur. Second, that Mr. Roosevelt's proposal to expand the air force could increase the business of aircraft companies by 40% compared to 1938. Experts believe that countries not subject to U.S. neutrality laws will purchase American aircraft in large quantities, greatly developing the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Visit to the Vatican; Pope Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 13th] Today's "Osservatore Romano" published a statement regarding Chamberlain and Halifax's visit to the Pope, stating that the Pope sent his regards to the British Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and expressed his gratification for their visit to the Vatican City. The Pope expressed particular concern for the recent situation of the British royal family and wished the British royal family prosperity and the British Empire flourishing. A number of issues concerning the relationship between papal jurisdiction and the British Empire were discussed, and satisfaction was expressed with the existing good relationship.</p>
<h3>Hungary Joins Anti-Communist Pact; Signing in Hungarian Capital Next Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 13th] The formal signing ceremony of the Anti-Communist Pact is scheduled to take place here next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] It was officially announced today that Hungary has accepted the invitation to participate in the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. Berlin was very satisfied with the news. The Berlin Evening News stated, "Those who participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact must not only understand the dangers of Bolshevism but also know how to combat it. This cannot be achieved through empty words or resolutions. The entire nation must have an iron will. The Anti-Comintern Pact has no imperialistic goals; its sole task is to create world peace and order to avoid the threat of Bolshevism."</p>
<h3>British Imperial Air Route from West Africa to South America Will Not Be Established Due to Opposition from Spanish Rebel Forces</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 14th] General Franco, the leader of the Spanish rebel forces, has refused British planes permission to fly over Spanish territory under his control, because Britain has not yet formally recognized the Burgos government. Therefore, Britain has decided not to establish the Imperial air route from Britain, via British West Africa, to South America.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in San Francisco Bay; Five Inmates Attempt to Escape by Swimming; Two Shot, Three Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Reuters, San Francisco, 13th] San Francisco Bay was shrouded in heavy fog yesterday, the worst in years. Five inmates at Alcatraz Prison attempted to escape by swimming to the opposite shore. Prison guards were alerted, immediately issued a warning, and opened fire. The notorious kidnapper Berg, serving an unspecified sentence, was shot in the head and seriously injured. Another notorious criminal, Stanfield, was shot in the leg. The other three were also captured and returned, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japan's War Against China: Hu Shih, Ambassador to the United States</h3>
<p>Editor's Note: This selection is from a public speech given in New York in December by Dr. Hu Shih, our Ambassador to the United States. The original text was lengthy and contained many historical references. Due to space constraints, we have translated a summary to share with our readers.</p>
<p>If someone were to ask me, "How would you describe the current situation in China in a single sentence?" I would answer without hesitation, "China is struggling for its life in a sea of blood!" Our opponent is the third strongest naval power and the fourth or fifth strongest army in the world. We have been fighting them for sixteen months now. Our casualties exceed one million. Vast territories are being swallowed up by the invaders. Almost all of our well-known industrial, commercial, educational, cultural, and transportation centers have either been ravaged or occupied by them. Our people have abandoned their homes, fields, shops, towns, and villages and are fleeing for their lives. They have no shelter, no medicine, and often not even the simplest necessities. There are no fewer than sixty million such people. And every day, countless innocent 'non-combatants' are brutally murdered by the enemy army. In light of this, is China not struggling for its life in a sea of blood?</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, many of our people and leaders experienced temporary hesitation and even despair. But that period of hesitation was also a period of great determination. Our leaders soon came to the conclusion that there was no possibility of peace for China at the present time, because there was no opportunity for peace that we could reasonably accept. After carefully considering all the difficulties and possible changes, our leaders firmly decided to continue to pursue the policy of resistance and maintain the war effort.</p>
<p>When announcing this new determination, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically pointed out the following: (1) China will continue to pursue its national policy of protracted resistance; (2) the war has now effectively spread to the entire country. The enemy has penetrated inland, and both time and geography are in our favor; (3) the resistance over the past sixteen months has prevented the enemy from advancing further west, allowing us to develop transportation and logistics in the vast rear areas and to relocate some industries to the rear; (4) to hope for final victory, we must endure the greatest difficulties and sacrifices; (5) the current war of resistance against Japan must be regarded as a revolutionary war, similar in nature to the American War of Independence, the revolutionary wars in France and the Soviet Union, and the Turkish War of Liberation. In this "revolutionary war," the people's spirit of struggle will surely lead to final victory. The above is a solemn declaration of China's new determination.</p>
<p>Regardless of how people in the world may feel about our new determination, I can honestly say to you that a nation that has already sacrificed one million lives and is determined to fight for its survival, making the greatest sacrifices, cannot be blamed for placing its hopes on what may seem like a mere pipe dream. In the past sixteen months, we have experienced terrible but also extremely valuable wartime experiences. Our determination is based on this experience. In these terrible sixteen months, we have clearly seen that our soldiers and officers are brave and heroic, and they have made the greatest sacrifices. Our people have endured losses and suffering without complaining to their government, and there is no doubt about the unity and solidarity of the entire nation (including the areas temporarily under enemy military occupation). We also know that our enemy is indeed feeling the burden of a prolonged war. Japan's finances are on the verge of collapse. It is now using all of its military strength, and it is fighting a nation that it never considered capable of fighting. It is very anxious because a significant portion of its stockpiled military supplies, originally intended to strike against its reinforced enemy, has already been depleted. Therefore, as long as we can persevere and exhaust the enemy, it is not impossible to achieve victory.</p>
<p>During the American War of Independence (1776-1781), the circumstances of Washington's "Continental Army" were not much better than those of the Chinese army today. In fact, all "revolutionary wars" involve a war between a people with ardent ideals but poor equipment and a well-equipped regular army of an oppressor or aggressor nation. But without exception, final victory almost always goes to those who embrace ideals and courage and can overcome the greatest difficulties and sacrifices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the success of the American Revolution was due not only to the protracted resistance of the revolutionary army but also to an equally important factor: the assistance of international forces at the time. For China to achieve ultimate victory, it must rely on two things: First, it must continue to resist; there is no other choice but to continue to resist. Second, in its protracted resistance, one day the international situation will be favorable to China and unfavorable to Japan. China does not expect any sympathetic nation to help it fight, but it has the right to expect the men and women of all democratic and peace-loving nations to prohibit the supply of weapons to that country, which is unanimously recognized by more than fifty countries as a destroyer of world peace. I can say without hesitation that this country is "Public Enemy Number One" in the international community!</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of American Warships Sail to the Atlantic, Taking Precautions While Passing Through the Panama Canal; Details of Transit Prohibited from Disclosure</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone, 14th] Eighty-nine U.S. Pacific Fleet warships (including several of the largest battleships) sailed from the Pacific Ocean into the 45-mile long Panama Canal, bound for the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Naval authorities took precautions as the ships passed through the canal, instructing reporters not to disclose details of the transit, but allowing them to comment on its effects. Army soldiers were also prohibited from approaching the canal, and army planes monitored the airspace at all times. The aircraft carrier USS Lexington, displacing 33,000 tons, led the way, departing Balboa at the western end of the canal at 14:59 hours.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Sudden Increase in Tension in Europe</h3>
<p>Sudden Increase in Tension in Europe -- What demonstrates the sudden increase in tension in Europe? First, the failure of the Anglo-Italian Rome talks; second, Germany and Italy's aggressive tactics to disturb Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Italian Rome talks failed because they produced no results. But whose failure was it? First, we must see that Mussolini gained nothing from these talks. Second, we must see that Chamberlain did not continue to yield during these talks. Seeing these two points, we can understand that it was the aggressor, Italy, who failed. So what impact will the failure of these talks have? First, under the influence of the broad public opinion at home and the calls for international justice, especially the progressive policies of the United States, the Chamberlain government has begun to correct the policy of appeasement that followed the Munich Conference, and it is now possible that its attitude towards fascist aggressors will no longer be one of submission. Second, the Chamberlain government will gain domestic and international support, especially alleviating the anti-government fervor at home. If Chamberlain's appeasement policy can be further corrected, then the prestige of the Chamberlain government will hopefully be consolidated. Third, Anglo-French cooperation will become closer, and the situation in which the German-Italian aggressive axis opposes them will become more serious. Fourth, military expansion will progress rapidly, and the cries of impending war will become even more rampant. In particular, Germany and Italy will make greater preparations for aggression, and even launch larger wars of aggression. The opposition between the democratic peace front and the fascist aggressive front will become more obvious. In particular, the democratic peace front will rapidly become stronger, completing the steps to sanction the aggressors.</p>
<p>Now, the European situation has suddenly become serious due to the failure of the Rome talks. This is clearly a result of even more arrogant intimidation tactics by the German and Italian aggressors. In particular, while British Foreign Secretary Halifax is in Geneva meeting with French Foreign Minister Bonnet, events such as the concentration of Italian troops on the Bulgarian border, Germany's intensified aggression against the Netherlands, and even all kinds of covert activities to sow discord between Britain and France are bound to occur and are not surprising. It should be noted that this was expected when the peace-loving and democratic countries truly began to implement a tough plan against Germany and Italy. This tense and serious situation cannot intimidate any truly peace-loving country. What should be noted today is that the attitudes of Britain and France should become clearer, and even neutral countries such as Romania, Poland, the United States, the Netherlands, and Belgium should not allow Germany and Italy to touch them in the slightest. They should declare their opposition to aggression with force. Only then, even if the European situation is in great danger, is there still a chance of salvation.</p>
<h3>British Perceptions of the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>— (Continued from yesterday's London dispatch) Shudi [End]</p>
<p>The Daily Herald, with a circulation of over two million copies, is a well-known organ of the Labour Party. It is sympathetic to China, but sometimes likes to publish rumors that China will compromise through German and Italian relations, or doubts the consolidation of China's so-called "united front." The News Chronicle, which speaks for the Liberal Party, generally has an attitude very similar to that of Liberal Party leader Lloyd George's eloquence, strongly sympathizing with China and criticizing the incompetence of the current British government's policies. The Daily Mail is a newspaper of the opposition faction within the British Conservative Party. In general, its attitude is similar to that of The Times, the difference being in the writing. The Manchester Guardian's attitude is more religious than that of any other newspaper. Its correspondent in China is probably very close to the Church.</p>
<p>Parliament</p>
<p>The two houses of the British Parliament are a powerful source of public opinion sympathetic to China. Especially in the House of Commons, whenever questions about the Far East are raised, the sympathy for China is almost always completely clear. Each time, it forces the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who is responsible for answering questions, to a position where he has no room to retreat. Here, we must recall the voices and stances of many politicians who sympathize with China. Among them are the great orator Lloyd George and Lord Cecil, Lords Sidney and Cripps, the only Communist Member of Parliament, Gallacher, and female Member of Parliament, Wilkinson, and so on.</p>
<p>Aid to China Movement</p>
<p>The so-called "Aid to China Fund" is the most important organization in the open aid to China movement. Under its promotion, it has organized many demonstrations and marches, screened several films, held many gatherings, raised many medicines, and done some practical work. In addition, the largest in scale is the London Mayor's Relief Fund, which regularly calls on people to donate money to help Chinese refugees, and advertisements are regularly published in various publications throughout the United Kingdom. Under the organization of the "Trade Union," British dockworkers have launched several strikes refusing to load and unload goods for Japanese ships. The movement to boycott Japanese goods is also being promoted. Almost every few days, there is a case of a shop being fined by the court in a disgusted tone for disguising Japanese goods for sale, and this store is rejected by people in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Articles and Books</p>
<p>Recalling the articles on the Sino-Japanese war that have had a significant impact on the British people's perceptions over the past year, the first thing that comes to mind is more than ten powerful editorials in The Times over the past year. Next to come to mind are Mr. Churchill's insightful articles in the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, and then the articles in The Times by its correspondent in Beijing after personally visiting the guerrilla areas in the border provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, Shanxi, and Henan in China. As for books, the most influential is the recent "China" by world-renowned journalist Muriel, followed by Mr. Snow's "Red Star Over China" and Ms. Smedley's "China Fights Back." These articles and books, together with other scattered articles and books and magazines, have had a significant impact on the British people's views on the Sino-Japanese war today, forming the following picture: ——</p>
<p>A country larger than the United States, with a quarter of the world's most hard-working population, is fighting under the leadership of a great world hero in the most heroic, even all-out, and heroic sacrifice. The scenery of this country is as beautiful as the landscape paintings of Mi Fu and Wang Wei (this is the impression planted during the exhibition last year). The houses are elegant in the style of pavilions and towers, and the food is the best in the world (the Cantonese restaurants near Oxford Street in London are considered representative). What is especially important is that this nation is almost innately peace-loving (Lord Cecil said: "In the past hundred years, China has not waged a war of aggression").</p>
<p>However, this is only the obvious side: this side is created by more than a year of resistance. On the other side, there is also a temporarily hidden dark side. That dark side will immediately reappear as soon as China begins to compromise or submit: that is: disorganization, everyone is individualistic, bandits are everywhere, and even nature has changed, with endless wind and sand, people living in caves, and the Yellow River flooding everywhere like a monster. Together with the constantly crowded refugees running around, like the ants at the entrance of the Shanghai concession that often appear in movies.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council to Hold Regular Meeting Tomorrow; Chinese Ambassador Visits French Foreign Minister to Discuss China's Appeal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] The 103rd regular session of the League of Nations Council is scheduled to be held on the 16th of this month. The Chinese government's appeal regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute has been included in the agenda of this session, but it may not be submitted for discussion. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, recently visited Foreign Minister Bonnet to discuss this issue. It is reported that the League of Nations Council adopted a report on September 30 last year, advocating that member states should implement sanctions against Japan separately. The Chinese representative accepted this report on the condition that the appeal filed by his government would be kept on the agenda for discussion at any time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] As the League of Nations Council is about to meet, the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement has sent a telegram to the general meeting, requesting that the chairman, Sir Cecil, and Mr. Coddington, following the example of the statement made for Spain, issue a statement on the League of Nations' minimum responsibility towards China, and urge the League of Nations to accept China's legitimate and reasonable demands.</p>
<p>British and American Sanctions Against Japan Clearly Taking a Step Further</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 14th] It is increasingly believed in Washington that defense plans are actually dominated by the Far Eastern dispute—rather than the European dispute. In the message that President Roosevelt submitted to Congress, he only solemnly pointed out that the United States should avoid being drawn into the vortex of Europe, but did not express the same view regarding the Far East. If the United States participates in the Far Eastern war, it will mostly begin with economic sanctions against Japan, and in fact, this sanctions plan is clearly taking a step further. The New York Daily News stated that the United Kingdom and the United States are actually at war with Japan, because the two countries are now aiding China's war against Japan.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Canberra, 14th] It is rumored that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will launch an economic war against Japan. However, Australian Prime Minister Lyons said in Leicester yesterday that he had not confirmed this. Mr. Lyons said that the Australian government had not received any information from the British government on this matter, so it had not been asked to explain its attitude towards it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] General Sir Hubert Gough wrote to the Financial Times today, stating, "The current situation in China will destroy all of Britain's commerce and the interests of the British Empire in the Far East. It is time for the government to deal sternly with this danger. Our investments in China are suffering heavy losses, national income is decreasing, unemployment problems are increasing, and the people's tax burden is becoming heavier. Although we are extremely unwilling to take strong action, the government, for our benefit and safety, must have a limit to its tolerance and cannot allow others to go any further. Protesting to Japan is ineffective, so the government must take a more decisive attitude, otherwise, in addition to commercial losses, it may endanger our territories in Asia and the Pacific (including India) and threaten the existence of Australia. But today, the cards being played are not entirely in the hands of anti-communist countries. We still hold a very strong 'trump card,' even the strongest one."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The Daily Mail published a dispatch from its correspondent in Tianjin on its front page yesterday, describing the various events in which Japan is hindering British commerce in China. The correspondent said that the general opinion of foreign businessmen in North China is that if Britain does not find a way to stop Japan's unfair oppression, then British trade with China will decline.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Donations to the British China Relief Fund have now reached 163,000 pounds. The secretary of the China Relief Fund, Gordon Thompson, said that donations are pouring in every day, but the need is also increasing day by day.</p>

<h3>Refugees in Devastated Areas of Huizhou, Boluo, Etc. Are Starving, Cold, and Dying Daily; Relief Stations in the Interior Are Overcrowded with Refugees in Extreme Misery; Joint Relief Committee Resolved at Yesterday's Regular Meeting to Allocate $2,000 to Aid Boluo</h3>
<p>Since the enemy withdrew from Huizhou, Zengcheng, Boluo, etc., the areas have been ravaged and the disaster situation is extremely severe. The Huizhou Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has previously dispatched a total of 40,000 yuan in relief funds and over a hundred batches of medicines to various places for relief and rescue. Recent investigations by the chamber, based on reports from relief stations in the interior, indicate that the refugees are extremely miserable, and the number of people is extremely crowded. It is estimated that the Huizhou station currently provides relief to more than 5,000 people every day, the Boluo station more than 1,000 people, the Pingshan station more than 1,300 people, the Baimanghua station more than 1,050 people, the Danshui station about 7,000 people, the Zhenlong station more than 800 people, the Xinhu station more than 180 people, the Jiazipu station more than 1,400 people, the Xiayong station more than 1,200 people, and the Tiantangwei station more than 400 people. The remaining Pingtan, Hengli, Renshan, and other stations have not reported due to the remoteness of the roads. In addition to obtaining food, the returning refugees are destitute, with nothing left. Clothes and bedding have either been burned or looted. Moreover, many are suffering from illness due to displacement and wandering. The medicines distributed by the chamber are difficult to adequately provide for due to the vastness of the disaster area. Therefore, the number of deaths in various places has been increasing daily. It is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will have mercy on the plight of the refugees and donate cotton clothes, hemp bags, and various medicines. It is especially hoped that charitable organizations will deeply engage in relief efforts, which would bring immeasurable merit to tens of thousands of refugees.</p>
<p>The Joint Relief Committee of All Circles in Hong Kong for South China Refugees held a special executive meeting at the Women's War Relief Association at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Liu Qingxuan, Li Jianfeng, Lin Peisheng, He Weiwu, Lu Guomian, Lin Ciming, Lu Fu, Zhou Xingchi, and many others. (1) Matters for report: The General Affairs Department reported receiving letters from Tung Wah Hospital, Guangdong Provincial Bank, Bank of China, Ye Yinqi, Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, 453rd Brigade, and Buddhist Relief Association. After the reports were completed, the following items were discussed: (1) The Boluo Refugee Relief Committee requested funding for relief. Lin Ciming, the representative of the Investigation Team from the Guanglian Chamber of Commerce, reported on his visit to Xu Rangcheng, the chairman of the Huizhou Chamber of Commerce. Subsequently, the Relief Team reported that it was deemed impossible to go to the area to distribute relief and asked whether the conference could transfer the funds to the Huizhou Chamber of Commerce to send representatives to distribute relief. After deliberation by all parties, it was decided to allocate 2,000 yuan in local currency for relief and send a letter to the representative of the association requesting that a list of the required medicines and the quantity of cotton clothing be provided to the conference for processing. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Hung Hom Gillies Avenue: Five Robbers Commit Armed Robbery in Broad Daylight, Breaking into Second Floor, Tying Up Everyone, and Looting Valuables Worth Over Three Hundred Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, a case of armed robbery by five robbers occurred at No. 33 Gillies Avenue, Hung Hom, on the second floor. The tenant of the building, named Ou Yao, lives with his wife, two concubines, and several children. Also residing there are his niece, Lu Ping (13 years old), and a refugee who came to Hong Kong and is staying in the building. In addition, there are two maids, making a total of more than ten people living together. Ou is a foreman at Kowloon Dockyard, working in the new ship grinding department. Yesterday at 1 PM, after lunch, he returned to the dockyard to work. Only Ou's first wife, Li Zhang, second concubine, Chen Ying, third concubine, Zhang Yulian, and eleven children and women remained in the building. His daughter, Ou Yunhua (21 years old), was calculating accounts in the back hall, while others were chatting idly. At this moment, the building door was ajar, when suddenly,</p>
<p>Five Robbers</p>
<p>rushed into the building and immediately brandished weapons at everyone. The robbers were holding a gun and five sharp swords. Seeing the robbers with deadly weapons, everyone in the building was terrified and trembling. The robbers then tied everyone up with their hands behind their backs and stuffed their mouths with rags to prevent them from shouting. They were all imprisoned in the second room, guarded by one robber, while the other four robbers searched the front room. They snatched a gold ring and a coat from the hanger, two pairs of gold earrings, four hand darts. The gold-plated chains worn by Li Zhang and Zhang Yulian, as well as one gold ring each, were also stolen. Fortunately, Ou's second concubine, Chen Ying, was clever. When she saw the robbers entering the building, fearing that she could not escape, she secretly took off the gold chain and a gold ring she was wearing and hid them in her mouth, so they were not discovered by the robbers. It was also fortunate that Ou Yao had taken the safe key with him when he went to work, so the deposits in the safe were unharmed. The robbers were in the building</p>
<p>Searching Freely</p>
<p>for half an hour before carrying the stolen items out the door, going downstairs, and escaping. When the robbers were about to leave, they threatened the people in the building not to report to the police station, otherwise they would come back next time and stab them to death. After the robbers fled, the girl Lu Ping untied everyone. Ou's third concubine, Zhang Yulian, informed Ou at Kowloon Dockyard, who went to the Hung Hom Police Station to report the case. The officer on duty at the station, upon receiving the report, dispatched Chinese and Western officers with a large number of police detectives to the scene to investigate and searched pedestrians at nearby key traffic points, hoping to find the robbers. As a result, nothing was found and notifications were sent to police stations in various districts to file the case and</p>
<p>Issue an Arrest Warrant</p>
<p>to bring the robbers to justice. The stolen gold jewelry and valuables included two gold-plated chains, worth about one hundred dollars; three gold rings, worth over forty dollars; four hand darts, worth about eighty dollars; two pairs of gold earrings, worth about thirty dollars; and other silver items, totaling about three hundred dollars. It was also found that the robbers had prepared a letter in advance, addressed to "Second Wife of the Ou Household, For Your Review," intending to use it to trick their way into the building. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the building, the door was ajar, allowing them to enter directly. Before leaving, they left the letter in the building. It was later collected by the police detective as evidence.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees: Two Hundred Pass Through Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Italian cruise ship "Victoria" passed through Hong Kong en route to Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying about two hundred Jewish refugees. Except for two people who went ashore to find relatives and friends in Hong Kong to find a way, all of them continued to Shanghai on the original ship. Mr. Lan Du, the owner of the Jimmy Restaurant in Hong Kong, has been working hard to help Jewish refugees. That day, he went to the ship himself and distributed about one hundred blankets to the refugees. The Jewish Refugee Relief Association of Hong Kong also sent people to provide assistance and guidance. The plight of this group of refugees is not as severe as the previous one. Some even traveled in first-class cabins. However, there are already a large number of such refugees in Shanghai, and the issue of sustaining them has become very difficult. With the addition of this group, the number will reach two thousand. Without raising a large sum of money, solving the problem of food and housing will be extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Pays Attention to Citizen Nutrition: Commission Appointed to Investigate</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government is paying close attention to the nutritional issues of citizens, believing that malnutrition affects public health. In order to study solutions, the government has appointed a Nutritional Investigation Committee to investigate nutrition issues and study the food rations that Hong Kong citizens should have. The list of members was published in the Gazette as follows: Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke; Chief Justice Sir Atholl MacGregor; Mr. Li Yingtang; Dr. Welch; Dr. Ross; Dr. Li Zuyi; Mr. Chihlan Chiao; and Mrs. Hu Fengyi.</p>
<h3>Happens Daily: Another Fishing Boat Robbed by Pirates, Boat Owner Also Captured</h3>
<p>The burning and looting of fishing boats by warships off the coast of South China has been happening frequently lately. Yesterday, fisherman Li Xiyao reported to the Fishermen's Association about being robbed by pirates. At the end of last month, Li and several partners sailed out to sea to fish. In the waters off Wanshanwei, they suddenly encountered a warship and the entire boat was taken by the pirates. Only six partners escaped. Li himself was also captured. It was not until five days ago that he managed to escape by chance in the waters of Beikou. He sailed back to Aberdeen the day before yesterday. The loss in this incident was dozens of piculs of fish, several hundred dollars in cash and jewelry. According to Li Xiyao, a fisherman from Dianbai, his original fleet of ten fishing boats was burned by warships in September of the year before last. Now he has been robbed again, truly a case of one misfortune after another.</p>
<h3>Shek Kip Mei Village: Fire Last Night, Three Wooden Houses Burned Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 6:00 PM, a fire broke out in Shek Kip Mei Village, Sham Shui Po. The area is mostly low wooden houses built by villagers themselves for residence. The villagers, due to unknown carelessness, suddenly caught fire, which spread quickly everywhere. In an instant, it had spread to other places. The villagers fled in panic. Upon receiving the report, the fire department dispatched fire engines to the scene for rescue. The fire was extinguished in about half an hour. As a result, three wooden houses were burned down, the fire area covering fifty feet wide and thirty feet deep.</p>
<h3>Governor Announces Milk Pasteurization: Implementation Changed to April 1st</h3>
<p>The Legislative Council resolved a few days ago that the new milk pasteurization ordinance would be implemented on January 1st of this year. All milk must be pasteurized by high-temperature sterilization before it can be sold. However, according to yesterday's Gazette, the ordinance was postponed to April 1st. The notice reads as follows: "By order of the Governor in Council, due to special circumstances, it is deemed that the supplementary ordinance is not suitable for immediate implementation, as it may conflict with the content of the main ordinance. However, the Governor in Council has decided to postpone the supplementary ordinance to April 1st."</p>
<h3>Police Conduct Raids Night After Night to Arrest Prostitutes in Secret Dens: Multiple Cases Already Cracked, Severe Penalties Imposed, Authorities Determined to Eradicate Prostitution</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the ban on prostitution in Hong Kong, private prostitution is still rampant. Secret dens of private prostitutes are everywhere in Hong Kong and Kowloon. People concerned about social welfare are deeply saddened by this. The genuine abolition of prostitution should be realized in Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong does not remain a major stain.</p>
<p>Private Prostitution Affects Health</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many prostitutes from the war zone have moved to Hong Kong. In addition, many poor women who have fled to Hong Kong have been lured into prostitution by pimps due to economic pressure. There were already a large number of private prostitutes in Hong Kong. Adding to this, the newly arrived "goddesses" has caused the numbers to swell. With so many private prostitutes, youths with weak awareness are often attracted to patronize them, resulting in many contracting venereal diseases. The large number of venereal disease doctors in Hong Kong and the brisk sales of venereal disease medicines can be used to gauge the state of private prostitution in Hong Kong. It is recalled that the Hong Kong naval authorities previously ordered strict prohibition of sailors patronizing prostitutes due to a sharp increase in sailors contracting diseases, showing how private prostitution can affect public health. According to statistics from the Department of Health, the number of venereal disease cases in Hong Kong last year increased several times compared to the past. The reason is the prevalence of private prostitution.</p>
<p>Government Authorities Strictly Crack Down on Private Prostitutes</p>
<p>The problem of private prostitution in Hong Kong has now attracted serious attention from government authorities. The government has now made the greatest determination to strictly crack down on private prostitution, striving to achieve complete eradication. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Hallifax, is extremely vigilant in detecting organizations that traffic women and secret dens that harbor prostitutes, hoping to arrest them all. Multiple cases have already been cracked. The police are also paying close attention to private brothels (i.e., brothels that only arrange for customers to call prostitutes from outside) and gathering places for private prostitutes in various districts of Hong Kong, preparing to wipe them out in one fell swoop and remove the big stain on Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Police Mobilize to Arrest Private Dens</p>
<p>Regarding the crackdown on prostitution, the police authorities have reportedly formulated a complete plan, preparing to completely eradicate private dens and fundamentally prohibit private prostitution within a set time. The police have already mobilized, going to various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon for patrols. In the past week, multiple cases have already been cracked. In order to prevent pimps from resorting to all sorts of cunning tricks, the police have recently focused on arresting the pimps who run these dens and imposing severe penalties, so that those engaged in shameful business cannot buy people to take the blame and must suffer criminal punishment themselves. Because the police have been frequently mobilized night after night, the private brothel areas in the Central and Western districts have been in a state of fear. Pimps and private prostitutes huddle on the streets, returning to their dens only after the police leave, in an extremely embarrassing situation.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Firewood Merchants Association Talks: No Fear of Firewood Shortage, Current Firewood Supply Sufficient for One Month, Prices Not Stable Purely Due to High Freight Costs</h3>
<p>Although the firewood shortage problem in Hong Kong is gradually easing, and prices are gradually falling, with one dollar able to buy over sixty catties, it is still far from the past when one dollar could buy one hundred catties. In order to make everyone understand the current situation of firewood in Hong Kong, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Fang Meiquan, chairman of the Firewood Workers Union, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to him, there is currently no need to worry about the source of firewood in Hong Kong being cut off, because there are currently many ships coming to Hong Kong from various regions that are dedicated to transporting firewood. There are four ships traveling to and from Haiphong, five from Guangzhou, four from Sandakan, and six from Singapore. Each ship can transport over 10,000 piculs to Hong Kong. There are also small shipments from Shantou, Macau, and other places. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the source being cut off. As for prices, the reason why they have not returned to normal despite such a large amount of incoming goods is purely due to high freight costs. For example, transporting firewood from Haiphong to Hong Kong costs one dollar for over one hundred catties at the local wholesale price, but the cost of transporting each bundle of firewood to Hong Kong is as high as four cents. Adding various necessary expenses, the cost is still high. When firewood is released in Hong Kong, it only costs over seventy catties per dollar, while residents who buy it retail from firewood shops only get over sixty catties. Mr. Fang also said that the current firewood supply in Hong Kong is sufficient for the entire city's residents for one month, and sources from various places are continuously being shipped to Hong Kong. Therefore, although the Lunar New Year is approaching and firewood sales are higher than usual, prices should remain stable and not rise sharply.</p>
<h3>Flying Hotel Arrives in Hong Kong on February 1st</h3>
<p>A recent report states that the first Pan American clipper of the new Boeing type will leave the United States at the end of this month, crossing the Pacific Ocean and arriving in Hong Kong on February 1st. This initial flight is purely for testing purposes and will not carry mail, cargo, or passengers. If there are no obstructions, it is expected that regular flights can begin on February 18th. In the future, there will be one flight per week between San Francisco and Hong Kong. Since the loss of the Hawaiian Clipper, Pan American has had insufficient aircraft allocation, causing frequent delays on the Pacific route. This issue can now be resolved. The new aircraft weighs 42.5 tons and can carry 84 passengers. After its maiden voyage, it will be the world's largest civilian aircraft, twice the size of the China Clipper, costing 400,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Luo Xuchu Asks the Authorities to Find a Way to Handle the Aftermath of the Wounded and Dead of Our Isolated Army Incident; Hong Kong Authorities Promise to Improve in the Future</h3>
<p>The Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp holds nearly a thousand Chinese soldiers who mistakenly entered British territory. Due to verbal conflicts with Indian guards, there have been incidents of Indian soldiers opening fire. Since Christmas Day on December 25th of last year, similar incidents have occurred twice in just two weeks, resulting in one Chinese soldier shot dead and two wounded. Those concerned about this incident are increasingly worried that the biggest reason for these unfortunate incidents is the language barrier between the Indian guards and the Chinese soldiers, leading to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is inevitably conflict, and there is a strong desire for the authorities to find ways to improve this situation and handle the aftermath properly. Sir Luo Xuchu, the leading Chinese representative in Hong Kong, is very concerned about this and specifically visited the Colonial Secretary and the Secretary for Chinese Affairs a few days ago to inquire about the strategy for handling the aftermath. Both Secretaries expressed their deep regret, saying that they will find ways to make improvements in the future to avoid similar unfortunate incidents from happening again.</p>
<h3>Various Import Merchants Request Extension of Delivery Period After Successful Negotiations: The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Response Letter Did Not Formally Agree, Various Firms Have Handled It Well, No Obstacles Ahead</h3>
<p>The import firms (piece goods, foreign goods, electrical appliances, copper and iron) previously sent a letter to the four Chinese representatives, asking them to mediate with the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce to allow an extension of the delivery period. This matter has been reported in the previous issue. Now the merchants have received a reply letter from the four Chinese representatives, stating that regarding your association's request to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce for an extension of the delivery date and exemption of storage rent and interest, our representatives entrusted Sir Luo Xuchu to meet with the chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce yesterday. The chairman stated that this matter is a private trade, and the seller, buyer, and merchant have a joint relationship. Even if the seller is willing to consider it, the manufacturers may not be willing to accept it, and this matter is agreed upon by the three parties. All handling is at their discretion and cannot be interfered with by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the banks. For this reason, we are unable to assist, etc. Accordingly, we are writing to inform you of the situation. However, how the import merchants will respond is of great interest to the general public. Therefore, our reporter visited the chairman of each merchants association to inquire about everything. According to them, before discussing the request for progress at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, each firm had already started to proceed on its own, consulting with various foreign firms to extend the delivery period. Because of the long-term trading relationship, there is considerable affection between them. Most of them have been successfully negotiated. The reason why each party declined this time is because they are restricted by trade regulations and cannot formally agree. Therefore, they said that this is a private trade and cannot be interfered with by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the banks. However, each firm has already handled it well, and the delivery deadline for each firm should be resolved satisfactorily. There should be no major obstacles ahead.</p>

<h3>Eating in Hong Kong!</h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Sixty-Seven New Restaurants in Six Months</p>
<p>"Eating in Guangzhou" has long been famous throughout the country. Since Guangzhou is so particular about food, Hong Kong, which is close to Guangzhou, is inevitably influenced by it. "Guangzhou Delicacies" is already a sign held high by every restaurant in Hong Kong. After the fall of Guangzhou, "Guangzhou Delicacies" can only be found in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Take the recent reality as an example: eating in Hong Kong is even better than eating in Guangzhou! Let's see, Hong Kong not only has Cantonese restaurants, Sichuan restaurants, Malay restaurants, and Javanese restaurants, but also foreign restaurants that are more sophisticated than those in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>This is an obvious fact. Since the outbreak of the war, Hong Kong's eating has not only changed in quality, but also increased dramatically in the number of restaurants.</p>
<p>In the seven or eight years before the war, Hong Kong's restaurants suffered unprecedented misfortune due to the impact of the economic downturn. Tangxi was a famous place for "opening banquets to enjoy flowers and toasting to the moon," but because of the economic downturn and the abolition of prostitution, several famous big restaurants also announced their closure. Other large and small restaurants in the city also declined sharply, with almost half of them closing down.</p>
<p>At that time, even the big restaurants had to rely on the tea market and mahjong games to survive, using the policy of "small profits and quick turnover" and offering "economic seasonal dishes" for three or five cents per dish to adapt to the low purchasing power of society. The "mahjong dishes" for nine dollars for four dishes or eight dollars for six dishes were also enough to attract many mahjong gamblers.</p>
<p>Seeing the improved business of the newly emerging ice rooms, middle and lower-class restaurants also changed their direction and switched to running ice room businesses. The so-called ice room does not only sell ice cream and soda. Originally, it was a food store that sold abalone, ginseng, shark fin, fish maw, seafood stir-fries, congee, noodles, rice, steak, coffee, and milk. Because this type of ice room did not have a tea charge like a restaurant, the "soft drink" was "small but complete," but the price was very economical, and one could eat a full meal for a few cents, so there were many customers, which conformed to the business principle of "small profits and quick sales."</p>
<p>The rise of ice rooms was a "new village" discovered by the restaurant industry when it was at its wit's end. In the beginning, business was good because it was "economical," but later, more and more were opened, and the number of customers did not increase, so the business was dispersed among everyone. Restaurants and food shops became very deserted.</p>
<p>After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, things changed. Many people came to Hong Kong to seek refuge, and the abnormally developed Hong Kong market benefited first from restaurants and food shops. Any restaurant, dining room, teahouse, ice room, food shop...was "three times as profitable." In the morning, noon, and evening, it was often impossible to find a seat even after visiting several restaurants. No wonder speculators stepped up the pace of opening restaurants and food shops to seize the fleeting "good opportunity."</p>
<p>Hong Kong's restaurant and food shop industry, which had been declining for many years, came to life. New ones were opened every day. Even streets that used to be very quiet now had food shops. The prosperous streets were even more numerous. According to the investigation conducted by the reporter with the "Municipal Health Bureau," the competent authority for issuing restaurant and food shop licenses, in the last six months—from July to December of last year—a total of 57 food shop licenses were issued in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Forty-one were approved and sixteen were not. A total of twenty-six liquor licenses were issued, all of which were approved. All twenty-six of these restaurants were in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to the above numbers, Hong Kong and Kowloon added 67 restaurants and food shops in six months. From this, we can extrapolate that since the outbreak of the war, Hong Kong and Kowloon have added at least a staggering number of more than 100 restaurants and food shops in one year and seven months.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong is still in a housing panic, many houses have been demolished and rebuilt into large restaurants and hotels. Therefore, some people say that in the future, living in Hong Kong will mean sleeping on the streets, but one can go to restaurants to eat.</p>
<p>Speaking of eating in Hong Kong, it really is non-stop for 24 hours a day. At 4:00 AM, before dawn, the teahouses open to facilitate customers drinking morning tea. They stay open until about 11:00 AM. At 12:00 noon, the lunchtime business of the teahouses, Western restaurants, and restaurants is also booming. Those that do not sell alcohol open until midnight, and those that sell alcohol open until 2:00 AM. One hour later, the teahouses' morning tea session opens again. This cycle continues endlessly, and what is busy is eating.</p>
<p>Let's analyze the customers who eat in Hong Kong society: the customers for morning tea in teahouses are mostly from the middle and lower classes. The customers for breakfast in foreign hotels are mostly young gentlemen and ladies. At noon, wealthy merchants, tycoons, and gentlemen mostly go to restaurants. Small businessmen and freelancers mostly go to tea shops and tea rooms. Office workers and students mostly go to Western restaurants and ice rooms. The customers for afternoon tea are mostly young gentlemen, office workers, and ladies.</p>
<p>From 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM, it is a tense time for eating. Teahouses, tea rooms, ice rooms, restaurants, dining rooms, restaurants...are all crowded with customers. This time and noon are the most difficult times to find a seat. Many people stand in line waiting in every restaurant. It's not easy to eat extravagantly even if one has money.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the decadent thinking unique to places where the sound of cannons cannot be heard. "Eating is paramount," "Eat first, then pay," and "eating and drinkingism" are very popular and fashionable. The owners of restaurants and food shops are "beaming with joy." Many large-scale restaurants, hotels, and teahouses in Hong Kong are speeding up construction, preparing to open before the Lunar New Year!</p>

<h3>Two Tragic Accidents in Wan Chai and Kowloon: Boy and Girl Die Under Wheels, Bus Runs Over Boy in Front of Wan Chai Post Office, Girl's Liver and Brains Splattered on Lai Chi Kok Road</h3>
<p>At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a tragic accident occurred in front of the Wan Chai Avenue East Post Office, where a child was run over and killed by a car. The area is a prosperous district in the Eastern District, with a narrow road and many long-distance buses and private cars passing by. At the time, a child of about eight or nine years old wanted to cross the road from the front of the post office to the opposite street. Suddenly, a China Motor Bus Company No. 491 long-distance bus traveling on Route 5 from west to east passed in front of the post office, and just struck the child as he was crossing. The driver desperately tried to brake to stop, but it was too late. The child was knocked down by the front wheels, and with a sudden thud, the rubber wheels ran over the child's body, crushing the child and causing serious injuries. The waist and feet were bleeding profusely. The driver quickly got out of the car to check, and nearby police also arrived at the scene. They first dragged the child out and reported to the police station by telephone. Before long, a police car from the nearby No. 2 Police Station was dispatched to the scene. Because the child's injuries were critical, they did not wait for the ambulance to arrive and first transported the child to the police station to report the case, intending to transfer him to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injuries, he reportedly died en route. Police detectives at the scene recorded the license plate number of the accident vehicle and filed it. They took the driver back to the police station to question him and take a statement. At about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Kowloon bus of a certain number was traveling from Yau Ma Tei to Sham Shui Po. When it was driving near the junction of Lai Chi Kok Road and Poplar Street, a girl of about eight years old suddenly ran out from under a building, intending to cross to the opposite side. The person and the car collided. The rear wheels of the bus ran over the girl's head, instantly causing it to explode. Brain matter and blood splattered everywhere, and the internal organs were also seriously injured. The girl died on the spot. The bus driver stopped to check the accident, saw that the injured person was dead, and immediately informed the Sham Shui Po Police Station. The police station dispatched a large number of traffic police detectives to the scene to investigate. Later, a black box car transported the body to the morgue, summoning the deceased's parents to come forward to identify the body.</p>
<h3>Approaching Date of Golden Gate Exposition; Busy Shipping Domestic Goods to America; By a Talented Writer; Those Participating in the Exposition are All Handicrafts and Antiques</h3>
<p>To commemorate the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, the United States is holding the Golden Gate International Exposition to inspire people around the world with the elegance of great architecture. The opening date is set for February 18th of this year. As our government is preoccupied with the arduous war of resistance, it is unable to attend to this matter. The "Overseas Chinese Commercial Exhibition Corporation" organized by overseas Chinese in the United States will participate in the exposition by building a "Chinese Village." They have also sent a representative, Kuang Guangyin, back to China to collect goods for exhibition in the United States. As all the details have been reported in the newspapers, Mr. Kuang returned to the United States on the 6th or 8th of this month.</p>
<p>With just over a month until the exposition opens, the deadline is approaching, so the shipment of domestic goods to the United States is extremely busy. Amidst the intense war of resistance, the collection of domestic goods has been quite difficult due to the blockage of inland transportation, so the collection has been limited to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The general exhibition plan is as follows: The Overseas Chinese Commercial Exhibition Corporation has over forty booths. The nature of the goods exhibited in these booths is stipulated for merchants to contract. Shanghai merchants are contracting nine booths, and Hong Kong merchants are contracting four booths, responsible for collecting domestic goods and transporting them to the United States for display and sale. The Hong Kong merchants contracting are China National Products Promotion Center, Lok Hing Company, Wah Hing Company, China Tea Company, China Handicraft United Company; and consolidating all these is Kam Cheung Company. On December 10th of last year and the 4th of this month, there were two shipments of goods to the United States, but these were not goods but decorations for the exhibition site and props for opera troupes. The first batch of goods was shipped out on the President Cleveland, which departed at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 14th). This shipment contains a total of 193 boxes, valued at 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited Kam Cheung Company to inquire about the shipment of domestic goods to the United States. According to the person in charge, "Chinese merchants are participating in the exposition with limited funds, so we cannot fully meet expectations. Moreover, because the production areas of many specialty products have been affected by the war, we have no way to collect them, so we feel even more difficulty. However, we are still actively trying to find these goods. Chinese industry is still in its infancy, and mainly consists of handicrafts, so most of the goods collected this time are exquisite artistic handicrafts. The goods collected in South China are Gu embroidery, antiques, calligraphy, and valuable handicraft products. There are also golden dragons, silver dragons, lion dances, Cantonese opera, and other performances to celebrate. In Shanghai, the wealthy merchant Lu Lian is responsible for collecting the goods, which will be transported to Hong Kong for consolidation and then shipped to the United States. We cannot neglect handicraft art products. This time, the Fuzhou lacquerware and Shantou drawnwork collected by the China Handicraft United Association are unique Chinese products. When these goods arrive in the United States, they will make industrial nations appreciate the delicacy and artistry of handicrafts, which cannot be matched by mechanical industry. But because the production of handicraft products is slow, after this batch is collected and shipped out, those still being processed will be completed and shipped to the United States batch by batch. In the future, even if the exposition has already opened, we can continue to ship goods. In short, our participation in this exposition is mainly based on domestic handicrafts. Also, the antiques and calligraphy by famous artists shipped out by the China National Products Promotion Center are sufficient to promote our country's inherent art."</p>
<p>It is heard that the second batch of goods is scheduled to be shipped out on the 27th of this month. In addition to the exhibition of goods, there will also be a variety of entertainment programs in the venue, managed by Modern Company. In the future, beautiful Chinese women will be selected to manage the goods in the exposition, adding to the visitors' interest.</p>

<h3>What I Hope For from the China Art Theater</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Yuqian</p>
<p>The comrades of the China Art Theater, none of whom are over thirty years old, have all undergone many hardships. When they were in distress and at a loss, they asked me to help them. I could not bear to see them wander in foreign lands, nor could I bear to see them scattered in different places, causing a group of young people with relatively skilled performance skills to be torn apart and forced to abandon their profession for the sake of survival. Therefore, after a night of consideration, I decided to accept their request and agreed to direct plays for them.</p>
<p>A new theater troupe was established, and the first public performance began. This took more than a month. During this period, I saw their lives change very rapidly. Their living quarters were clean and tidy. They strictly adhered to a set schedule for getting up, eating, and sleeping. They were extremely focused during rehearsals, and there was no joking or noise. Another noteworthy thing was their increased desire for knowledge. They read newspapers and books, invited people to give lectures, and paid attention to social affairs, gradually moving towards the actual experience of life and society. In terms of thought, they gradually shifted from fantasy to the pursuit of reality.</p>
<p>They inevitably had youthful spirits and emotional outbursts, but their self-governance also developed accordingly. They deeply realized that if life was not organized seriously, the effectiveness of their work would be reduced. Recently, all their measures have been taken voluntarily, and there are no written rules of punishment or reward governing them. I am merely assisting and reminding them from the side.</p>
<p>I am quite self-aware and have never wanted to be a leader. My qualifications as a leader are not sufficient. A leader must be the central figure of a movement. He must not only be able to recognize the correct path, but also be able to maintain a firm stance. His personality, morality, knowledge, and writing must be exemplary. He must have ample energy and keen intelligence to cope with complex personnel matters and difficult environments. I feel ashamed when I examine my heart in the quiet of the night. I can only comfort myself with the constant effort and the belief that I will not fall behind. I am only a technical staff member, a worker with more experience, so I am only helping and serving the China Art Theater, not leading them as a leader. If they can do their work well under strict organization and make a full contribution to the theater movement—the movement to revive the nation, strengthen the foundation of the country, and transform society—I will certainly share in the honor. If they cannot govern themselves and their work declines, I will not evade any responsibility that I should bear. That is all.</p>
<p>I believe that as long as every worker truly has the courage to be a person and do things, they should not be afraid of admitting mistakes. The worst thing is to blame others. It is also worst to be arrogant and look down on others, which closes the door to progress and can lead to great danger. Theater is a group art, and a person without sociability cannot become a good actor. The idea of individual heroism must be overcome. If there is the slightest selfishness, it will destroy oneself and one's career. Even if there is occasional success, it will often affect greater achievements because of a lack of clear understanding. These are the most easily formed weaknesses. I hope that the comrades of the China Art Theater can pay attention to these things at all times, strive to establish self-criticism to improve efficiency, strive for the highest standards of technology, and gradually achieve the intended tasks. This is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Another point is that some people think that as long as an actor sincerely practices acting, there is no need for literary and political cultivation. This is completely wrong. In feudal times, actors were despised by society, and they also maintained a certain degree of mystery about themselves. Now the times have changed. Theater directly reflects contemporary society, so a good actor must be able to approach society and delve into society. How can a person who is engaged in social education movement succeed without understanding social conditions? How can a fighter for the nation be isolated from politics? Therefore, it can be known how the comrades of the China Art Theater should build their foundation. This is true not only for the China Art Theater, but also for other theater groups. This is recognized by all armed workers in the new era.</p>
<h3>A New Force in Anti-Japanese War Drama: A Visit to the China Art Theater; A Conversation with Mr. Ouyang Yuqian</h3>
<p>— Qiuluo</p>
<p>The era is always moving forward. The alarm bell of the era is constantly ringing in our ears. The era does not allow "corruption" to exist, because "corruption" will hinder the progress of the era. Today, China is facing a great era of revival, and also a terrible era of danger. However, we are not willing to let China sink. On the contrary, we will do our best to support the glory and ultimate victory of our motherland. We are theater workers, and today, we should use our sincere and pure conscience, our heroic and hard-working spirit, to extensively promote and develop anti-Japanese war drama.</p>
<p>As a new force in anti-Japanese war drama—the China Art Theater. We look forward to it as much as we look forward to the victory of the anti-Japanese war. Everyone knows that this new force was split from the "China Travel Theater." Regarding the past of the "China Travel Theater," we will not repeat the old story now. From today on, we are paying attention to the China Art Theater. We will not let it go, because tolerance and weak love will often harm the cause and the future of people. Our attitude will be the same as that of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, decided by reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's first sentence was: "Cultivate yourselves, acquire knowledge, and live a serious life. Reverse the previous willfulness of taking acting as a play, and quickly develop political consciousness." Therefore, the members of the China Art Theater now have established reading groups and forums. They have invited Mr. Xu Dishan, Tao Zhixing, Hu Chuncheng, Xu Beihong, and others to give lectures in turn, and they are also engaged in the study of politics and economics. As for life? Now they get up at seven o'clock and rehearse until night, rehearsing one play and then another. They are trying to achieve progress in performance. All the previous bad habits have been swept away and they are starting anew.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang's second sentence was: "The members will be evaluated based on points. The difference in points between members cannot be too large. Those with outstanding achievements will be rewarded with increased points, but equality will still be the principle." This means that as long as members work hard, they will be treated the same. As for increasing the points for those with outstanding achievements, it is intended to be a reward. Life is not just about eating, but about interest. A life without interest is a dead life. Bookworms read books to death, read dead books, and die reading books. This is the reflection. Those who engage in drama are not individualists seeking fame and fortune like bookworms, but have a sense of the masses and perform for the masses. They are one of the masses, not arrogant like bookworms who think they are "cranes standing among chickens."</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's third sentence was: "The points are public, and the treatment is consistent. The China Art Theater is everyone's China Art Theater, not an individual's China Art Theater." What a frank and honest statement. Only by putting such honest words into practice can a troupe be united and developed. We reject dictators, ambitious people, and plunderers, because these people are not worthy of being in the realm of art. The China Art Theater is using a united will to form a mainstream. If this mainstream is maintained well, it will be as solid as steel. An iron-like theater troupe is especially needed today. We will sincerely support it and spur it on, not allowing it to be crooked or sluggish. Of course, the comrades of the China Art Theater will give us a factual answer and will not disappoint the good intentions of Mr. Ouyang's instructions.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian also has a valuable suggestion, which is to prevent the China Art Theater from becoming a commercial theater troupe. It is said that a businessman once offered to take out 10,000 yuan to manage the business of the China Art Theater. The members of the China Art Theater resolutely rejected it. This is one noteworthy event. The China Art Theater plans to use Hong Kong as a supply station, and when necessary, will go to the mainland. The mainland can provide more opportunities for performances and make it easier to improve acting skills; the mainland can get closer to the people, and it is easy to learn some knowledge in organizing the people, so the enthusiasm of the China Art Theater to return to the embrace of the motherland is always beating, but it is only a matter of time. This is the second noteworthy event. Mr. Ouyang humbly said that he is not a leader but a servant, because he saw the enthusiasm of the comrades of the China Art Theater, so he joined, nothing else. Mr. Ouyang repeatedly talked about his efforts for theater, using his fifty years of age and many years of experience to tell the younger generation what the world is like. What a kind teacher, but with such a modest attitude. This is the third noteworthy event.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the China Art Theater, in addition to performing "Song of Righteousness," for more than a month, they have been gathering in a small building in the Kowloon Peninsula, burying themselves in hard work. Under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, they are stepping up rehearsals for new plays every day, preparing for a large-scale performance. In addition to re-staging the old plays that the China Travel Theater performed in Hong Kong, they are starting to rehearse. The plays they are preparing to rehearse include "The Wilderness," "The Capture Record," "One Year," "Floating Corpse," "Bandits," "Resurrection," "Winds on the Stockade," "Behind the Green Gauze Tent," "The Power of Black Money," and other dozens of plays, all day long. The tense rehearsal state is full of active vitality. Attracted by this active vitality, many people have joined the troupe to work—initially there were only sixteen male members and three female members; now there are over eighty male members and over ten female members!</p>
<p>Since the China Art Theater has members who are willing to learn with humility, and also a teacher who is willing to teach with humility, the development of the future is a matter of course. Now, they will formally perform "Song of Righteousness," "Beside Oneself with Joy," "Thunderstorm," and "The Inspector General" at the Central Theater on the evenings of the 17th and 18th of this month, and perform in Hong Kong at the Puqing Theater from the 19th to the 22nd. In this place where theater is just growing, we always hope that the China Art Theater will take on the responsibility of cultivating it, clearing thorns and removing weeds, so that flowers can bloom and fruits can bear.</p>
<p>Lu Xun said: "We should create a large number of new internal warriors, because there are too few people now." Take this famous saying as the conclusion of this article.</p>

<h3>Unveiling a New Page in the History of Spoken Drama Movement</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>Since 1928, practitioners of the spoken drama movement have been shouting the slogan every year that this year is the "Year of Drama", but in fact, before the July 7th Incident, the Chinese spoken drama movement had never "become a great force". After more than ten months of baptism and motivation of struggle, on the Double Tenth of 1938, China started the first drama festival, and the organization of the China Art Theater was almost at that time, which was to unveil a new shell in the history of the Chinese spoken drama movement: 1939, which takes blood as the year of national revival, is the real, year of drama.</p>
<p>Because spoken drama is most able to reflect reality, the history of spoken drama development and the national liberation movement are mutually supportive. Just by looking at what the spoken drama movement has shown in the fighting for more than ten months, you can know what the spoken drama movement should do in this year of the beginning of light.</p>
<p>From the July 7th Incident to the present, the spoken drama movement has first changed from positional warfare to mobile warfare. That is, the large drama troupes that are generally concentrated in cities, and the drama organizations of multi-national groups that have sprung up like "wind" and clouds, have all been distributed to the mainland on a large scale and in a planned manner to work. This kind of mobile warfare has enabled the peasants in the mainland and even in remote rural areas to receive the baptism of spoken drama, to know their own destiny and the destiny of their family and country, and to know the mission that history has given them. Workers have also gained a lot of experience, and the dramas that truly meet the needs of the masses, and serve as the epic of the bloody struggle for survival for one-fourth of mankind, have been produced. This seed of culture, this enlightenment movement knows the needs of the masses, negates the simple copying or imitation of European and American dramas, negates the emotional preaching of intellectuals, and is not only the expansion of the spoken drama movement, but also the internal element of the inevitable victory. The yeast of the battle has taken effect.</p>
<p>Secondly, the spoken drama movement has closely linked its own destiny with the liberation of the people. Spoken drama work has become an organic part of the war. As a result, the drama has become armed; drama workers have gone to the army battlefield and into factories and farms to preach the gospel of liberation to them, and army camps, factories, and villages have also begun the spoken drama movement. This awakening of the national soul has become the most powerful weapon for the masses to educate and mobilize themselves. The spoken drama movement has been liberated from the narrow confines of the literati's preferences and the petty-bourgeois intellectual's circle, and has been able to actively become a link in the nation's movement for freedom. Spoken drama only began to have a soul, only began to have flesh and blood: only began to have life.</p>
<p>The increase in quantity naturally leads to a change in quality. The expansion of widespread activities will inevitably lead to a deeper understanding of theory. New requirements have been put forward: a large number of scripts that meet the needs of the masses are created, reports and studies on the conditions of drama movements in various places, the depth of technology, and the provision of diversified methods are urgently needed to be resolved. Secondly, the masses in the rear or the overseas Chinese residential areas are usually anesthetized by the entertainment brought by the old forces, and they also need new substitutes. These new substitutes of course have realistic new content, but they also need artistic forms of moderation and popular artistic skills. These can be solved in part by national organs and schools, and they are also working hard to solve them. And an organization that exists in the folk, such as a specialized art troupe, is especially necessary.</p>
<p>The basis for the existence of the China Art Theater is even more here; its meaning of production is also no more than this. Some people say that Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's position in the Chinese art world can be compared to Stanislavsky from Imperial Russia to the Soviet Union. In this analogy, the Art Theater will be the Chinese "British National Theater". This is not necessary. Because Mr. Ouyang has not received the rich tradition of Imperial Russia, his decades of artistic life have been revolutionary, creative, and non-academic. At present, his personal achievements may not be as many as Mr. Shi's, but his ambition and great strength to serve the nation are very healthy. The China Art Theater may not be so "standard" in art, but as a large "Larrey Force" (laboratory) of the national drama movement, a large supply station, and one of many powerful engines, isn't its task more important and sacred? For the free and happy survival of 400 million people, as drama workers, we should cooperate with reality, demand to enhance subjective strength, gather everyone together, and unveil a new page in the history of spoken drama movement.</p>
<h3>Drama Movement</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Actors in Hong Kong Hold Meeting</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, drama workers left in the city scattered in various directions, and information was quite isolated. Several dozen people have arrived in Hong Kong one after another, such as the group members of Lanbai, Yixie, Fengshe, Rao Feng, Chunlei, and Hongliu. Recently, Guangzhou drama seniors Hu Qingshui and Lei Qinan have initiated and summoned a meeting of Guangzhou actors in Hong Kong. It has been scheduled to be held at Zhu Baishui's residence at 550 Nathan Road, Kowloon (telephone 58724) at 12 noon on the 15th of this month as a gathering place for a suburban trip to reminisce about the past and connect future work in various aspects.</p>
<p>The Times Theater Troupe Performs in Macao for Charity</p>
<p>In order to expand the anti-Japanese war propaganda, promote the Macao drama movement, and respond to the request of the second troupe of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association to serve the country and raise funds for charity, the Times Theater Troupe mobilized 27 or 8 members to Macao on the 27th of this month! On the evening of the 10th, they began performing at the most prestigious Victoria Theater in Macao. The repertoire for the first night and the second day was "Thunderstorm", which was extremely popular. The second night and the third day's matinee was "Luminous Cup", and the evening performance was "The Paint Is Not Dry". The above three days were for the relief of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association and the Macao refugees. From the 13th to the 14th, the troupe raised funds on its own. The repertoire performed on the 13th was "The Paint Is Not Dry", and the evening performance was "Promoting Officials and Getting Rich" (ie, Chen Baichen's "Devil's Cave"). On the 14th, the matinee was "Luminous Cup", and the evening performance was still "Promoting Officials and Getting Rich". The itinerary back to Hong Kong is probably today!</p>
<p>The Amateur Association Theater Troupe Performs for the First Time</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Amateur Association is a group composed of young people from the Hong Kong professional industry. There is an Amateur Association Theater Troupe inside. Although the organization has not been established for a long time, because the participants have a keen interest in drama, they have already had a very good work performance! That was on the day of the founding of the Hong Kong Amateur Association on the 8th of this month, they performed a national defense play "Song of the Night" (written by Ling He) at the Confucius Hall. Although it was the first performance, the results were quite satisfactory. It is said that they have engaged the famous actor Cai Chusheng to serve as the chief instructor of the troupe, and the future achievements will definitely be very real and very progressive.</p>
<h3>This Glory Belongs to the Hong Kong Drama Movement! Foreword to the 1938 Hong Kong Drama Performance Statistics</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>The Hong Kong drama movement has, over the past year, developed its new life drop by drop, and expanded its territory.</p>
<p>What is most unforgettable for us is the joint performance of "Frontline Storm" and "Blood-Soaked Sky" by the Shanghai Customs Long March Troupe's August 13th Singing Team and the Hong Kong Art Group, which brought about a new turning point. Following that, the China Traveling Drama Troupe and the Xinhuan Drama Troupe came to Hong Kong one after another, and the Era Drama Troupe appeared with a strong and steady posture, making the entire Hong Kong drama scene exchange a fervor of excitement.</p>
<p>On the surface, we see the public performances of large theater groups, embellishing the bustle of the theater scene, but in reality, the performances of small theater groups or associations operating privately are very frequent. Although they are not widely known, the actual effects obtained are very far-reaching.</p>
<p>Time flies; 1938 passed amidst the flames of war. It is doubtful whether the harvest of the Hong Kong drama scene in this year can be calculated in words or writing. However, if we use statistical methods to investigate the number of performances, large and small, across Hong Kong in a year, at the very least, we can obtain a rather astonishing number.</p>
<p>I myself did not keep good records on a daily basis (indeed, there was no way to keep records). During the year-end period, I hastily spent a few days investigating the number of drama performances across Hong Kong. This work is arduous and unrewarding. However, I bravely took on this burden and did it.</p>
<p>It is quite astonishing. Unexpectedly, the total number of performances, large and small, across Hong Kong in a year is close to two hundred. But this is only what is already known; the unknown, forgotten, and many uninvestigable are still unknown in number. Most obviously, many school performances have been omitted, which is an irreparable regret!</p>
<p>In this statistical table, we can clearly see the following four points of opinion:</p>
<p>In the War of Resistance, we should mobilize all forces to support this great torrent. Although Hong Kong is a colony, for the final victory of the motherland, we should turn the most powerful cultural work into this torrent. The Hong Kong drama movement has taken on a great task in this regard. Every performance is an anti-Japanese war drama, and is closely linked to the struggle of the motherland. This is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>In the past, Hong Kong's drama was supported by a small number of aesthetes. However, after the War of Resistance, this inferior trait was eliminated, and it embarked on coordinating with the struggle against the war, and used different performance methods to work, expanding the scope of the masses. Not only were there public performances in theaters, but also performances in halls, and even mobilized to the suburbs and villages such as Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung, and Ngau Chi Wan. This is also worth noting.</p>
<p>Of the nearly two hundred performances, popular anti-Japanese dramas accounted for 80%, which shows that popular drama has great potential, and shows that the newly emerging serious drama has penetrated into the lower masses. In the future, in addition to striving to increase large public performances, popular performances need to strengthen their strength even more.</p>
<p>Although the number reaches nearly two hundred times, which is quite considerable in quantity, the actual quality requirements are too urgent. We not only need to increase the number of performances, but also need to increase the quality requirements. Only when both quantity and quality advance simultaneously will it be a good impression.</p>
<p>However, in any case, we can feel comforted and find many drops of sweat and hard work from this huge number! We will grasp her and continue to fight forever!</p>
<p>This glory belongs to the Hong Kong drama movement!</p>

<h3>Peng Dehuai Talks About the War Situation in North China Continues on the Second Edition</h3>
<p>(4) The Hebei Plains Guerrilla Force, × people threw fast troops and cavalry, and could attack, the strike team used old grass-cutting knives to ambush underground, sharp blades facing the sky, covered with floating soil, when the × people's fast troops arrived, the wheels were punctured, unable to move forward, and triangular nails were used to ambush underground, nail tips facing the sky, when the Japanese × cavalry arrived, the horse's hooves were injured, unable to move forward, the old people called this "old grass-cutting knives defeat new weapons, triangular nails injure × horse hooves."</p>
<p>(5) In June and July last year, 5,000 workers in Tangshan revolted and defeated two battalions of Japanese soldiers, seizing many guns and weapons. Today, it has developed into a powerful guerrilla force of more than 10,000 people, fighting fiercely on the border, Chaoyang, Shanhaiguan, and eastern Hebei. This uprising involved the participation and leadership of comrades from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and some also heroically sacrificed themselves. This is called "5,000 Workers in Tangshan Revolt and Defeat Two Battalions of Japanese Soldiers."</p>
<p>(6) In backward areas, such as the mountainous areas of Pinglu, Shanxi, the old people believe in Bodhisattvas, but they also hate the Japanese equally. They make small bodhisattvas out of millet flour and wheat flour, and eat them facing the sun, expressing their curse on Japan, meaning to eat Japanese devils. They also sing a nursery rhyme, "Seven families make noodles, three families make rice, every family gets up to cook the Japanese, you eat arms, I eat legs, leaving the head for the dogs to lick." They cook devils on the first and fifteenth of every month. Although this is their superstition, it fully expresses their national consciousness and hatred for the Japanese ×.</p>
<p>(7) Also, the itinerant vendors in the cities occupied by the × have joined the puppet organizations, but they still have a strong patriotic heart. The people around Jizhou, when you meet them, they will tell you, "My body is in Cao Ying, but my heart is in Han. I will not be happy until I kill the Japanese."</p>
<p>These facts are not small things, but great national stories, which have been compiled into popular operas and widely spread among the people. As for the people of North China spontaneously destroying roads and transportation, harassing and attacking × people, blocking news, capturing traitors, and actively helping the army, leading the way, transporting supplies, and women sending their husbands to join the army...the facts are countless.</p>
<p>c. Mass Work Under Various Situations</p>
<p>(zi) Anti-Japanese Farmers' Associations and Trade Unions: Farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population. In the long-term people's liberation war, farmers have a decisive role. Under the various evils of the Japanese ×, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the farmers is becoming more and more obvious. At the same time, under the exploitation of heavy rents and high-interest loans, the lives of farmers are the most difficult. They have no political status, and their demands to improve their lives and raise their status are also very urgent. This is something that no one can ignore. If this is forgotten, it is impossible to lead and organize farmers. The victory of the War of Resistance will depend on the farmers. Under the principle of "Anti-Japanese First," it is entirely necessary to appropriately improve the lives of farmers. It is correct to mobilize farmers based on this.</p>
<p>In North China, farmers have a fairly widespread organization, which has played a major role in the War of Resistance. They have provided various assistance to the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, and the status of these families has been improved. High-ranking government officials have gone to encourage and greet them. In addition to spiritual rewards, material assistance has also been provided, so that the parents of soldiers going to war do not feel any difficulties after their sons and husbands leave, but feel that it is supreme glory. At the same time, mobilizing family members to write letters to encourage soldiers to fight bravely has further improved the combat effectiveness of the troops.</p>
<p>Secondly, educating farmers to work hard to produce so that they know that increasing production greatly helps the war. Therefore, the harvest in North China last year, in our recovered areas, not only did not decrease compared with before the war, but increased by 20% to 25%. Grain prices are very low, six yuan for one dan of millet. This is entirely due to the increased enthusiasm of farmers for labor, and production has naturally increased.</p>
<p>In addition, the replenishment of troops for the Chinese army is no problem with the active participation of farmers. I have never seen the phenomenon of "drawing" or "pulling." In addition, farmers organize self-defense forces, stretcher teams, help the army fight, transport, or eliminate traitors, lock down news, etc. In North China, surrounded by the Japanese on all sides, it is really difficult for traitors to operate. Every time they pass through a place, they must have a road pass or a letter of introduction to pass. Even without a road pass, even if they see shepherds in the mountain gullies and slopes, they must stop them for questioning. We have received documents from the × people saying that they have sent traitors to the Wutai Mountain area to operate dozens of times without getting any response, and they were arrested. This shows the failure of the × people and the difficulty of traitors' activities.</p>
<p>Farmers have such a role and achievements, so why don't we actively mobilize and organize them? At the same time, in mobilizing and organizing farmers, we have also implemented the principles of the Anti-Japanese Nation-Building Program and the principles of improving the lives of the people. Anti-Japanese is the first priority, and the lives of farmers are improved locally. The method of implementing five rent reductions or two-five rent reductions is to have the farmers' association responsible for inviting the landlords to come and hold meetings to discuss and adopt peaceful persuasion methods to obtain the consent of both parties. Most landlords are enlightened and know that without rent reductions, it is impossible to mobilize the people. In this way, the farmers' anti-Japanese enthusiasm and production energy are further increased.</p>
<p>"Those who have money give money, those who have strength give strength." This is the principle of reasonable burden sharing. However, in addition, we also heard farmers say, "As long as those who have money give money, will the poor not be willing to give strength?" This heartfelt cry touched us deeply. Therefore, interest rate reductions have also been implemented in North China. The past interest rate of 3% has now been reduced to 1.5%.</p>
<p>This kind of life improvement, the improvement of farmers' political status, and the leverage are naturally improved. Participating in the War of Resistance and working hard to produce, the replenishment of troops is no problem, and the supply of food is no problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, because farmers have organization and training, once they are educated, their national consciousness is improved, and they know that they will not do anything that benefits the × people. Therefore, in Hebei and Shanxi, farmers voluntarily do not grow cotton or flaxseed oil, but grow grain, so as not to be exploited by the ×, and at the same time increase grain production.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the work of workers in North China is relatively poor, because large cities and transportation routes are occupied by the ×, and the gathering places of workers have been lost. However, there are still considerable organizations for the manual workers in Tangshan and other places, and the workers can best express their determination and perseverance in the War of Resistance. For example, the workers of the Liuhegou and Jingxing coal mines automatically blew up the mines, and the 5,000 workers in Tangshan launched an armed uprising.</p>
<p>(chou) Youth and Student Work:</p>
<p>In addition to general anti-Japanese cultural organizations such as the National Salvation Association and the Anti-Japanese United Association, there are also the following organizations:</p>
<p>(1) Singing Teams: Popular throughout North China. The content of the songs is about resisting Japan and saving the country. Now, in all the recovered areas of North China, workers, farmers, women, and children, whether young children or youth, can sing salvation songs, replacing the past frivolous lyrics and ditties. This really helps the anti-Japanese mobilization.</p>
<p>(2) Drama Teams: Masquerade speeches, such as "Eight Hundred Heroes," "Hatred of National Subjugation," "The War of Resistance Will Surely Win, and Nation-Building Will Surely Succeed," and other dramas, are widely performed, exposing the various atrocities of the × people, establishing confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, and encouraging many social welfare undertakings and production mobilization, which have had great results, and have improved the cultural level of the countryside.</p>
<p>(3) Organize literacy movement groups, distributed in various villages and cities, serving as literacy teachers in night schools for workers, farmers, women, and children, promoting the literacy movement, reducing and gradually eliminating illiteracy. This is not only beneficial to the War of Resistance, but also cultivates the good habit of young students providing voluntary services to society, and increases their sense of responsibility for the War of Resistance. At the same time, this is indeed what young students are willing to do.</p>
<p>(yin) Women's Work:</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Women's Work: Women account for half of China's population, with more than 200 million people. Most of them are still enslaved slaves. Although the government has announced some articles, they are still very empty things. Therefore, most women in China are not only politically backward, but also have no economic rights and no opportunity to be educated. Especially in North China, they are still bound by the bad habit of foot-binding, which is even more pitiful. Under this kind of bondage, not only are they unable to be liberated while alive, but even superstitiously speaking, they are a ghost who is bound after death (referring to bound feet).</p>

<h3>Li Hua Cup, China Union Team Selected, General Association Expresses Dissatisfaction. South China Breaks Its Promise Not To Transfer Players Back To Participate. Lin Zhonghao Sends Urgent Telegram To Saigon To Request Troops Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Football Association has decided that the second act of the Li Hua Cup preliminary football match between the China Union team and the Navy team will be held at the Hong Kong Stadium on the 22nd of this month, and all the ticket revenue from this match will belong to the General Association.</p>
<p>At present, the South China team is the most popular team. During the team's expedition period, the football affairs on the island were diminished.</p>
<p>Before the team goes on a long-term expedition, it must report this matter to the General Association and obtain its approval before it can proceed.</p>
<p>Beforehand, the General Association was sincerely afraid that South China's expedition would not be able to return before the 22nd. For the sake of both, it earnestly stated to South China that, in any case, it must first transfer a few players back to Hong Kong to respond to the Li Hua Cup preliminary match, and must not make excuses to shirk responsibility. South China also promised, because this business has economic benefits. If the China Union team does not have a majority of South China players selected, then the appeal will not be great and the revenue will not be good. Therefore, it is no wonder that the council is quite concerned about this.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mo Ai, the leader of the South China team, sent back an airmail letter stating that Chen Dehui and Mai Shaozhang were retained by the Vietnamese host on the 15th to play an exhibition match, and it was difficult to disrupt the team midway. This news has been recorded.</p>
<p>After the aspect learned about this matter and the selected players for the China Union team, it was very dissatisfied, criticizing South China for breaking its promise. It is said that if South China does not transfer several players back to participate in the Li Hua Cup preliminary match at that time, the General Association will not approve the request to invite the Singapore China team to come to Hong Kong to compete in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Lin Zhonghao, the deputy director of the South China football department, urgently telegraphed Saigon to ask leader Mo for troops. How will this matter be resolved? Let's wait for the next installment. (Football Field Lord)</p>
<h3>Eastern Narrowly Defeats Kowloon Club</h3>
<p>The Eastern and Kowloon Club two-mid-group football teams met at the Hong Kong Stadium at 4 pm yesterday. Although the Kowloon Club was a long-distance expedition, it seemed to be losing ground. All the generals refreshed their spirits and seemed determined to win. Fortunately, all the Eastern generals worked together with one heart and were determined to engage in the battle. As a result, the Eastern team finally won with a strategy that was superior to the opponent, with a score of one to zero. Reviewing the skills of the players on both sides, Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, and Liu Shizan of the Eastern team are making progress every day. Luo Weiquan, Zeng Ziyun, and Hou Chengtang also performed well. Secondly, such as Li Deqi, Xu Jingcheng, and Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingshi, did their best to fulfill their duties. It is a pity that Song Zhongsheng was absent due to injury. The newly appointed defender Zeng Zuozhi was also a long-time veteran, and his strength was inevitably slightly reduced, resulting in several incidents. Fortunately, the three armies were ordered to turn danger into safety. On the Kowloon side, the central defense line was the strongest. Beles and Belu performed well. Defender Helijia also defended well. The five forwards were quite fierce, but the connection was poor and the shooting was inaccurate, so they could not draw the game. The battle situation is briefly recorded as follows.</p>
<p>As soon as the battle began, the two armies fought desperately, back and forth, which was quite spectacular. Five minutes later, Hou Chengtang advanced rapidly along the side, and then quickly kicked the cross, the landing point was the best. Yi Deqi and Qixiang were one step late, and the great opportunity was lost. Kowloon counterattacked, the generals rushed forward, like mountains and seas. Jingcheng and Qixiang defended and Hanni Boli shot twice, but they were both saved by Xianhan's sharp eyes and quick hands. Before long, the East was forced to the city, Achen shot in front of the goal, the ball was as fast as an arrow, and everyone was in danger for the East, but unexpectedly, the ball hit the goalpost and bounced out, and the goal was not lost. At the critical moment, a kick back to the center, and East also tried to counterattack at this time. Deqi hit the ball alone, urgently outside the hundred steps, released a cold arrow, shot at the door, Helijia stood out, the ball then slipped back and rolled into the net, Helijia could not save again, Kowloon lost, several counterattacks and shots all failed, before long the first half ended.</p>
<p>After the rest, East was quite active, Chengtang's single force, as fast as lightning, but unfortunately, the last one was high, Kowloon Zuozhi, and Nuoshi attacked without success, Bingshi broke into the key point, and Yihua Lishi came to intercept, but was also passed, the situation was the best, but Helijia saved in time, after this, both sides lost ground, the result East won with a score of one to zero, and the lineup of both sides is as follows.</p>

<h3>Mui Fong Overwhelms Pui To, Championship is Already in the Bag. HKU Liang Wenhua Absent, Loses to Sze Sze.</h3>
<p>(Special Report from this newspaper) Ordinary circles women's basketball game, after a long night of fighting, the champion seat is already in Mui Fong's bag.</p>
<p>Pui To's great defeat was not undeserved, because on the one hand, it was naturally because Liu Qingcai was absent, resulting in a weak defense, and at the same time, Liu Yiyin and Luo Shaoxi's performances were really abnormal, and the connection was scattered, which was also an important factor in its failure.</p>
<p>There were really many fans last night, and the entire basketball room was crowded with them. The cheerleaders who came to support Pui To alone numbered about a hundred, which was a truly grand occasion.</p>
<p>In the first game between HKU and Sze Sze, on the HKU side, due to Wenhua's absence, its strength was actually weaker than Sze Sze's, so after the confrontation, it was at a disadvantage. On the Sze Sze side, Huang Qinfang and Wei Bao's performances were quite good. As a result, Sze Sze won two points with a score of thirty to sixteen.</p>
<p>The second battle, the shouting and applause of the cheerleaders started in the middle. First, Mui Fong took advantage of the moment when Pui To had not yet committed an offense, and the lively Lian Kai scored the first goal, taking the lead for a while. After a long time, Pui To returned with a goal by Xu Yinghua. After this struggle, the scores of the two sides were still not far apart. The first quarter ended with Mui Fong leading eight to seven.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Xu Yinghua took advantage of Chen Huiqing's foul and made a free throw, tying the score. At this time, Pui To's cheerleaders were very happy and sang a song to wish for victory in advance. But before the singing was over, Mui Fong took the advantage again, and Huang Baozhen and Ye Meilian added three points one after another. Thus, until the end of this quarter, Pui To's score was even further behind at nineteen to seven.</p>
<p>In the second half, Wu Huan Ying performed very well, following step by step, and firmly held Liu Yiyin, who was known for her accurate shooting, at a loss. Chen Huiqing was also not bad, and in the forward, Liu Meilian was like a flower butterfly, piercing left and right, making it difficult to catch. At the same time, Lu Huixian's performance was also very good. On the Pui To side, although Zeng Zisheng was also very hardworking, Guan Shuzhen failed to supervise Ye Meilian, and there was a sigh of looking after one and losing the other. Although the former Xu Yinghua scored the most points, it was a pity that she was too nervous, resulting in many missed opportunities. As for Luo Shaohui and Liu Yiyin, due to the fierce entanglement of Mui Fong's defenders, their performances were not good, so until the end of this quarter, Pui To was still unable to avoid being inferior to others with a score of twelve to twenty.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, although the Pui To generals still worked hard and frequently launched a general counterattack towards Mui Fong's position in an attempt to recover lost ground, the Mui Fong generals did not give up, returning the favor and going back and forth. At this time, Pui To also had cheerleaders cheering and cheering, but time was running out, so until the end of the game, Pui To lost with a ratio of twenty-two to thirty-five, and Mui Fong got the championship.

<p>Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of talent, with an extraordinary and moving power. James Stewart and Ruth Stratam co-star. In this film, we also see the most perfect table of robber actors in Hollywood. All the moving plots in this "Social Outlaw" will give the audience a large and strong new stimulus.</p>
<p>Queen's Peace... Blood on the Fishing Boats</p>
<p>Spawn of the North</p>
<p>A film adapted from , describing the lives of people in the northern border of the United States, the Alaskan Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean. The island is a large producer of "salmon". The fishermen who make a living by fishing must overcome all the natural difficulties for mankind with great efforts, such as icebergs floating on the sea, and the rampant piracy, to maintain their interests. In their lives full of joys and sorrows, there are many moving stories.</p>
<p>This film tells the story of two good friends who, because of conflicts over fishing profits, one cooperates with pirates, and the other joins the fishermen's self-defense group. Friends become enemies. At the same time, behind them are women who love them deeply, at a loss to do anything, watching them fight each other. Later, the one who cooperated with the pirates was finally injured and repented, so he crashed the pirate ship under the iceberg, perished with the pirates, sacrificed himself, and completed the love of his friends, which is the climax of the film.</p>
<p>The cinematography of this film is lively and ingenious, and there are also several shots of Indian sacrificial ceremonies, which, in our opinion, are full of mysterious meaning. At the same time, this film has five stars, starring George Raft, Henry Fonda, and Dorothy Lamour, and co-starring Akim Tamiroff, John Barrymore, etc. The arrangement of the plot allows everyone to have the opportunity to give full play to their artistic talents. Director Henry Hathaway, has directed films such as "The Shepherd of the Hills" and "The Lives of a Bengal Lancer", and is very powerful in handling the plot and climax of this film.</p>
<p>Oriental... Quirky Bachelor</p>
<p>Professor Beware</p>
<p>Harold Lloyd starred in "Movie Crazy". Because of the insult to China, it gives a very bad impact. For a while, no films will be shown in China. This time, the "Quirky Bachelor" is still the same style as before. The plot is wishful thinking, with the thrilling places on the farm, and his silly actions make people laugh. Naturally, there are also many humorous scenes and dialogues.</p>
<p>Great China... Tarzan's Revenge</p>
<p>Tarzan's R-venge</p>
<p>The story is mediocre, telling about an explorer who wants to capture a white person into the interior of the island. The king colludes with people and wants to take a white woman. Fortunately, Tarzan can save her. Later, the white woman falls in love with Tarzan and never goes back.</p>
<p>It is absolutely nothing surprising, far less than the previous "Tarzan and His Mate" starring Glenn Morris and Eleanor Holm.</p>
<p>Movie Star... Spring of the Young Swallow</p>
<p>Love And Hisses</p>
<p>A musical and dance film starring Simone Simon, Walter Pidgeon and Bert Lahr. It is Simone's first singing film, and the performance is not successful. The singing voice is also not moving. It is still the battle between the radio station announcer and the news reporter, but it is quite laughable.</p>
<p>Central... Love, Tears, and Blood (Mandarin Film)</p>
<p>It is adapted from the original work of Rou Shi, directed by Bu Wancang, who can be said to be familiar with the subject. The protagonist is still Jin Yan. Only the heroine and the supporting roles in the troupe have been replaced by Yuan Meiyun and Mei Xi et al.</p>
<p>The story, in simple terms, is about a woman who struggles in a feudal society and ultimately ends her life with self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it can be said to be a satisfactory work. Only the "Lovely Mother" opera is too long. Yuan Meiyun and Hai Yan's performances are not bad.</p>
<p>New World... Ardent Fire of Spring</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>This film tells the inside story of a hotel, the strange social movements, revealing the abnormal development of society, which makes people feel a great deal. This film is the first film of Justice Film Company, starring Xin Ma Shi-zeng and Deng Yunshang.</p>

<h3>On the Beach</h3>
<p>— Peng Chenghui</p>
<p>Stretching out in front is a vast expanse of white, a sea without end.</p>
<p>The clear sky is a boundless expanse of blue, without a single cloud. The sunlight shines so brightly on the sea, gently rippling with continuous waves, reflecting such a dazzling light, as if it were thousands of lumps of silver, so brilliant that it almost blinds the eyes.</p>
<p>The weather is a scene of peace, a warmth. The distant view of the sea is infinitely beautiful: white egrets fly up and down like dragonflies skimming the water. Several white sails float gracefully above, and occasionally one or two motorboats belching thick smoke pass by, the foam behind the boats boiling, forming a black path, but quickly disappearing into the wave shadows in an instant.</p>
<p>Behind is a continuous range of mountains, thickly covered with pine trees, with occasional clear singing of birds. Halfway up the mountain is a road sandwiched in between, leading to the green mountains, with buses often speeding past on it.</p>
<p>He sat alone on this beach, quietly gazing at the sea in front.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blew softly through his long hair and lifted the corners of his clothes. He felt a chill.</p>
<p>He had been adrift in Hong Kong for a full year. In this long line of drifting, he had never received news about his homeland. He had no friends or relatives here. It seemed that the twelve months had passed entirely on this island.</p>
<p>He thought silently, the sun shining on his body. He felt very warm. He immediately closed his eyes and rested his head on the stone. Very quickly, his soul returned to his homeland. He heard the clear singing of birds and the rustling of falling firewood. It was the sound of autumn arriving in the pine forest behind his house. The maple leaves were red, reflecting the sunlight, bright and dazzling, still so beautiful and poetic. Many leaves had already fallen in front of the steps. The flowing water murmured, as if someone was whispering. It was the spring flowing out from the mountain rocks in front of the door. The pond was dry, filled with silt, but the lotus stems still stood tall and firm. The lake in front lay quietly, as if sleeping, with no one to disturb its sweet dreams. The weeping willows on Su Causeway seemed to be thinking intently, silently drooping their heads. South Peak and North Peak faced each other in the clear sky, as if nodding and smiling, boasting of their towering grandeur. Lingyin Temple was shrouded in incense smoke, strand after strand, mixed with the sound of bells, still so solemn and magnificent.</p>
<p>The beauty of the lake and mountains, in the serene morning air, in the crimson afterglow, was limitless. Ah, how bright and beautiful this lovely hometown is!</p>
<p>As soon as the dream vanished, he immediately woke up consciously, opened his eyes and looked around, and found that he was still lying on the beach under the sun.</p>
<p>He remembered very clearly: he had escaped from the front lines on the night Hangzhou fell. He originally had a kind mother and an amiable father. He also had a sincere brother and a lively sister. Because of the fear, crowding, and haste when fleeing, he was separated from them. Because of the sudden intensity of the artillery fire and the chaos of the military situation at the time, he never had the means or opportunity to search for them. Therefore, he had to drift alone with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Ah ah—bright and lovely hometown. At this time, it must still be filled with jackal-like beast soldiers, right? The lake and mountains, under their hideous faces, must be frightened and dim. Between the fields and wilderness, perhaps the white bones of our brave soldiers are still piled up, left to be blown by the wind, exposed to the sun, beaten by rain, and invaded by frost. Who can go to pay their respects? A hibiscus tree in front of the door must have bloomed with bright flowers already. The fragrance of osmanthus must also have spread everywhere. I wonder if the cold plants in the garden are still as beautiful as they used to be? Perhaps everything has been destroyed by the flames of war.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, he felt that everything in the past was a sweet dream. He didn't know when he would have the opportunity to relive the old dream.</p>
<h3>A Small Record of Macau</h3>
<p>— Huang Kaiyin</p>
<p>People living in Macau, besides gambling and eating and drinking, seem to have no other enjoyment in life. In fact, in comparison with the name "Monte Carlo of the Orient," Macau can also be called "Rome of the Orient." Churches and crosses are visible everywhere. On Sundays, the mountaintops, central parks, and beaches are filled with a quiet chiming of bells, and the clear singing of the faithful is mesmerizing. The crosses on the tops of the churches emit rays of light. People walk slowly on the steps and enter the grand halls of those Western-style or Italian-style buildings. This scene, even in imagination, feels solemn, sacred, and full of old-fashioned charm. The depictions of the Middle Ages, whether in the streets or alleys, can often be surprisingly discovered.</p>
<p>Where I live is near a church on a hillside. At night, before going to bed, I turn off the lights and let the room become pitch black, and when I lie on the bed and think, the evening bells of the church ring out like a stroke of lightning in clear weather. Hearing that sound echoing in the midst of absolute silence, my soul is very happy, and then I fall into a sweet dream as if I had received someone's comfort.</p>
<p>From my place of residence to the seaside is not too far, so whether in the morning, at dusk, or at night, I love to light a cigarette and walk alone to the seaside. The bauhinia trees are covered with withered yellow leaves, and occasionally there is a tree with red flowers. However, I can't help but feel the winter cold. The sea lies lonely, and the fishing boats rest quietly in the heart of the sea, letting the slanting wind and drizzle sweep over their sails. Further away are small islands, one by one. The Dayu Mountain near Xiao Port is also faintly visible. In this mountain, I discovered tiny little black dots. ×××××××××××××××××? These days, their ships have come to visit, and the salutes are deafening. In gambling halls, dance halls, and on the streets, everywhere you see these arrogant and hideous creatures, and they are still wearing uniforms!</p>
<p>The winter rain is like a flowing stream and has a special kind of charm. From this, I remembered a line from a contemporary poet: "The May rain drizzles, the swift current is the most Kamogawa," what a rich vitality and life emotion!—Walking west along the embankment, I saw buildings along the way, combining the architectural styles of various eras and nations: there are streamlined German working-class family-style combinations, Chinese-style Western buildings that are neither fish nor fowl, and Westerners' houses are fond of painting orange-yellow and grassy green, but what I especially like are two small houses in the Southern European style, with delicate hexagonal lanterns in front of the door, chrysanthemums and sunflowers in the garden, and several rattan chairs placed beside the house, a small pug lying on the ground, staring wide-eyed at people, as if to say: "The masters have just finished talking, and now they have returned to the house!" If people see this even coordination, they will feel an indescribable softness and beauty. Imagine in the summer night, sprinkled with silver light, wouldn't the Southern Europeans hold a six-string guitar and sing a love song softly? It's no wonder that the two painters who came with me couldn't help but exclaim that they wanted to rent it as a studio.</p>
<p>Macau is worth your lingering, if you are not a pure gambler or a vulgar person. People on the streets walk side by side in the middle of the road, without having to be as apprehensive as walking on the roads of Hong Kong. Will you be reminded of walking on Shuangmendijie at night? What I have to say here must come to a stop.</p>
<h3>The Educational Nature of Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>Since it is said that writers are "engineers of the human soul" (Stalin), then literature and art must be a gift to the human soul! Literature and art guide people to understand reality, transform reality, and awaken a common consciousness, so that people engage in common struggles. The reason is that writers "must always be in a state of intense and revolutionary struggle with reality. Because he must think about changing reality, so he is revolutionary" (Fox), therefore his painful products—works—have a deep understanding, criticism, and solution of reality. Writers give these fleshy things to their readers from this place, which inevitably generates a sense of response to the masses and affects their actions.</p>
<p>"This is a necessary book. Many people unintentionally and instinctively participated in the revolutionary movement. Now, after reading 'Mother,' they feel that it is very beneficial to themselves and is a very timely book." Lenin evaluated Gorky's "Mother" in this way.</p>
<p>Gorky created "Mother" in the era of reaction after the failure of the 1905 revolution, telling the workers about the great faith and affirmation of victory. The educational significance of the harvest exceeded many others. His means were to unite and organize the workers. This is the high righteousness of art and defense. "Mother" became a necessary book—"a very timely book." From this, we can understand how a writer can stand in his own position and how he can develop the weapon of literature and art to cooperate with the battle.</p>
<p>Then, in this sacred liberation struggle, the political goal requires mobilizing the entire nation to resist the war, and literature and art cannot but be a means of educating the people and organizing the people. Perhaps it is said that literature and art only become the tail of politics? No, but we must first make literature and art keep up with the speed of the War of Resistance, and literature and art are to organize the souls of the people, with an inspiring nature, and at the same time, they must have a huge educational nature, which can correct the concepts and strengthen the beliefs of the people, and knowledge can be instilled, etc. The answer to the question is the transformation of the soul, making literature and art "necessary" and "most suitable" for the War of Resistance. Therefore, literature and art must have a huge educational nature, and our "soul engineers" must pay attention to educational literature and art.</p>
<p>Let's talk about a novel. In Zhang Tianyi's "Wang Scarface and Xiao Zhu" (Free China, Issue 3), Wang Scarface is an old soldier and only has "the brute force that doesn't care about heaven and earth." His battle style is "charging is omnipotent." In the battlefield, of course, he is the bravest soldier. On the contrary, Xiao Zhu is brave and resourceful. In the battlefield, Wang Scarface becomes a "brave but unwise" and impatient soldier. Because he does not understand and achieve the requirements of tactics, he is in vainly wounded and bleeding, and he cannot get back the price. Xiao Zhu is just the opposite.</p>
<p>Although this is not a very successful work, the author's intention is to achieve a kind of educational task, because in the current military situation of "the enemy is strong and we are weak," we naturally must have the determination to sacrifice at all costs, but impetuousness and recklessness, or "die-hardism," etc., make the sacrifice not worth it, and we must avoid it. The author uses images to express this point, so that it can be vividly understood and appreciated by people. It has to be said that it has the significance of educating soldiers. This is just a small example, and there are many things that are required, such as educating soldiers to love the people and working hand in hand with the people to establish a good new relationship between the army and the people; helping soldiers to recognize the tragic aspects and weaknesses of the enemy; and other instructions that are beneficial to combat, etc. Naturally, this can be completed by other methods, but literary and art workers cannot ignore their necessary tasks.</p>
<p>In the rear, literature and art should more widely and effectively promote its educational role. Literary and art workers should concentrate their attention on seeing through the depths of the souls of people of all classes and groups, accurately identify their weaknesses, and then, in the true posture of a "soul engineer," apply the skills of "acupuncture." On the surface, each person has his or her own unique questions about the War of Resistance, and naturally, it is impossible to answer them one by one, but what we rely on is the work of writing "typical characters," which is also the same as supporting the answers to the core of many questions. Art must be analyzed, summarized, and synthesized. For example, at present, × people are trying to implement appeasement tactics to deceive and seduce our people, and some people have weakened their hatred for × people. This is a major problem at present. How should we smash the conspiracy of × people? How should we treat the wavering of some of the people? Cultural workers cannot ignore this, and literary and art workers should further develop the educational nature of literature and art and take on this task.</p>
<p>The educational nature of literature and art develops with the development of the War of Resistance, and changes with the changes in all aspects of reality. It is multifaceted, constantly new, and therefore lasting and mobile.</p>
<p>However, a practical problem that lies before us is the popularization of literature and art. Although the theoretical provision of popularization, utilization of formal forms, etc., is quite rich, the practice is too backward. This not only makes it impossible to promote the functionality of literature and art highly and widely, but also makes the problem of popularization itself suffer. Theory guides practice, and practice can act against theory. This kind of reverse is important. Without practice, there is no way to empirically prove and improve theory. Therefore, literary and art workers cannot for a moment take their sights away from this problem.</p>
<h3>At Wu Family Lane</h3>
<p>— Ren Yong</p>
<p>Three years ago, I left Wu Family Lane. But I didn't bitterly miss her, because Jiangwan wasn't necessarily bad either. I could find true taste in the current environment, so why bother pointlessly indulging in the past?</p>
<p>However, now I intensely miss the past. In a series of memories, the beautiful Wu Family Lane emerges and floats up first. I deeply recall her, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes late at night.</p>
<p>Wu Family Lane has a unique beauty. It's a living beauty. There are five hundred acres of land there, and countless groups of young men and women. Among us, there are men like iron bulls, and maidens like Mulan. Our younger siblings are still babes, reeking of milk. The older ones wear old student uniforms and simple blue qipaos, while the younger ones are all valiant young soldiers, exposing their thick legs and displaying yellowish-red faces. What is this? Isn't this a living beauty?</p>
<p>The early morning is the most lovely time. In the breeze of the morning light, a bugle sounds, and groups of young people surge out of the dormitories on the west side, habitually forming rows. The physical education teacher shouts from the high platform in front of the flag. With a bugle blast, the beautiful national flag solemnly climbs the ten-zhang high pole. A thousand people stand on the field, but there isn't a sound. Each person is like an iron pillar, giving the highest salute to the national flag. Orderly, solemn, isn't that a living beauty?</p>
<p>The national flag flutters at the top of the pole, and the magnificent morning song roars from the loudspeaker: "...Caress the wounds of the Songhu battlefield, quell the unjust treaties, let the surge of patriotic blood well up a thousand zhang, when will the national power be displayed, the sovereignty asserted, the talented heroes bravely step forward, the youth of Shanghai boldly advance!..." Ah, what a completely vibrant morning.</p>
<p>During the day, we are all busy with books. The gatehouse and Xianmian Hall are where we forge our brains. After four o'clock, these two Western-style buildings become quiet. Groups of people, having removed their student uniforms, rush toward the sports field and gymnasium, the places where we forge our muscles and bones. Literature and martial arts, which one can be spared?</p>
<p>The setting sun quickly slips toward the west. The national flag, its face flushed, climbs down the ten-zhang pole. The heroic bugle calls every young person to stand still, still like iron pillars, protecting our national flag, slowly descending.</p>
<p>At night, the nine hundred acres of land are completely silent. The windows of the dormitories emit light, and our companions are again fighting desperately with knowledge. Literature and martial arts, which one can be spared?</p>
<p>However, I have been separated from this kind of life for three years. That kind of living beauty constantly returns to my eyes. I glance at it, and silently recall it.</p>
<p>Recalling, fantasizing, recalling, fantasizing, I can't help but be shocked. Now, at the top of the ten-zhang pole, I wonder what flag is flying? In the towering dormitories, I wonder what our bookworms and iron-men have become?</p>
<p>But every early morning, the bugle seems to still roar in my ears, and the national flag seems to still flutter between my eyebrows. I can't help but sing the "Morning Meeting Song" from my time at Wu Family Lane. On the drying platform, I stand like an iron pillar, exercising vigorously on my own, as if this one drying platform is equal to the broad field of five hundred acres. Recalling is useless, we need to work, we need to work eternally!</p>
