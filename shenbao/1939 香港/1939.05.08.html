<p>— 豊凱</p>
<p>前言——取得抗戰的真正勝利</p>
<p>中國的抗戰，是一個正議的，反侵路的戰爭，是一個自衛的，求解放的戰爭，其目的是在抵抗日本××主接的侵路及奴役中國人民的企圖，是在保衛中國民族和國家不受日本××主義的侵略，是在爭取中國民族和人民的獨立解放，中國的抗戰，是在全國人民的擁護之下進行的，像這樣的抗戰——正義的，反侵略的，自衛的，求解放的戰爭，必然能够取得全國人民的擁護，全國人民也必然會而且應當擁護這樣的戰爭。因此問題是我們怎樣來進行這個戰爭，以取得抗戰的眞正勝利。</p>
<p>「戰爭是政策的繼續」，這句歷史的名言，應當是成為决定我們的怎樣來進行這個抗戰，與决定怎樣才能取得抗戰的眞正勝利的政策的出發點。</p>
<p>伊里奇曾說過：</p>
<p>『戰爭是政策的繼續。應該研究戰前的政策，引起戰爭和巳引起戰爭的政策。如果政策是××主義的，就是保護財政資本利益的，掠奪和壓迫各××地和別國的政策，那末從這種政策中所產生的戰爭，也是××主義的戰爭。如果，政策是民族解放的，就是說表示反對民族壓迫的解放羣業運動的政策，那末，從這種政策產生的戰爭，就是民族解放的戰爭』。</p>
<p>一個被侵略的民族，從它的民族解放的政策出發，所產生的民挨解放戰爭，它必然要採取民族解放的政策，才能達到解放戰爭的眞正勝利，進行民族解放戰爭的政策，總的來說，就是全國人民的總動員，全國人民的總動員就是包括全國軍事的，政治的；民衆的，財政的，經濟的，敎育的，外交的各方面的動員，精神動員也就是這個全國總動員的一部，而且是以全國總動員為基礎。</p>
<p>對進行戰爭所應採取的政策，與對保證戰爭勝利所應採取的政策，這必然是與某個國家某個集團在戰前所實行的政策不能分離的。一個被侵略的國家，一個被俊略的人民，在戰前的長　內採取反對××主義侵略的政策，採取謀自己民族解放的政策，在戰爭巳經發生和進行時，爲要保證這個戰爭的勝利，它必需採取適應於反××主義侵略和謀自已民族解的放政策，伊里奇曾經說過：</p>
<p>「戰爭是用另一種方法的政策的繼續。任何戰爭是與產生戰爭的那種政治制度不可分離的聯系着。某個國家，該國內部的某個階級，在戰　的長時間內所進行的那種政策，必然的和不可避免這個階級要在戰時繼續那種政策。只是改變了活勸的形式」。（列寧全集，第三）</p>
<p>我們中國的民族，我們中國的人民，在長期的反對××主義侵略和謀民族解放的運動中所採取的政策就是民族解放的政策。現在，當着反對××主義侵略的民族解放戰爭巳經在進行的時候，我們要保證這個戰爭眞正的勝利，只有實行一個眞正的民旗解放政策。</p>
<p>最近國防最高委員會頒佈的「國民精神總動員綱領」，引起各方的關心和注意，這是必然的結果，因為全國人民對自己民族的命運，對中國抗戰的勝負，無時無刻不在注意和關心，因為全國人民總在期望實行一個眞正能够保證抗戰勝利的眞正的民埃解放的政築。我們的政府是一個領導抗戰的政府，它的措施和法令，無一不是與民　命運和抗戰勝負發生直接的和間接的影響，因此全國人民不僅對『國民精神總動員』表示示關心和注意，而且更希望政府能够採取進步的和積極的措施和法令，以保證抗戰的眞正勝利。</p>
<p>因此，我們想來，說明保證抗戰勝利的民族解放政策——全國人民總動員，說明「精神總動員」與全國總動員的關係，說明「精神動員」的內容和意議，是有特別的必要。</p>
<p>（一）全國總動員與「精神總動員」的關系</p>
<p>中國抗戰，是一個被侵略的民族進行民族解放戰爭，也卽是革命戰爭。關於民族解放戰爭，關於革命戰爭取得勝利的關鍵，就在於：</p>
<p>「……革命戰爭，當它眞正吸引和感動被壓迫勞動羣衆時，當它使被壓迫勞動羣衆覺悟到他們是反對剝削者的時候，這種革命戰爭就會引起神通廣大的毅力和能力」。（伊里奇）</p>
<p>很明顯的，中國抗日民族解放戰爭，為要戰勝日本××主義，就必需要有這個條件，就必需要具備這個條件，這個條件是抗戰眞正勝利最可靠的保障，要使這個條件能够實現，就是全國人民的總動員。</p>
<p>早在抗戰發生以前兩年，中國×××在『八一』宣言中就提出『全國人民總動員的』號召，並在這個總動員的號召下，具體提出，『有錢出錢，有力出力』，『有槍出槍』，『有智識出智識』等等口號，這正成為今天動員人民參加抗戰的行動方針。</p>
<p>當抗戰爆發時，中國×××又在對日本××主義進攻華北的宣言中提出：『實行全中國人民的總動員』，在抗戰發生不久後（一九三七年八月）在『爭取抗戰勝利的上大綱領』中提出：『軍事的總動員』，『全國人民的總動員』。在南京失守後，在對時局的宣言中，又提出：「動員全中國的武力，人力，智力，財力，物力，繼續守土衛國的長期抗戰』。</p>
<p>中國×××始終認為中國抗戰的勝利的保證，必需要有全國人民的總動員，精神動員，或政治動員，正是全國總動員之一部份，必須與全國總動員配合，則精神總動員自能在抗戰中發生應有之作用，如「國民精神總動員綱領」中所說：</p>
<p>現在戰爭為全民動員之戰爭，故不僅應動員國內一切之物質與人力，亦必動員全國國民之精神，欲總動員全國國民之精神以充實抗戰之國力，不　在於發動，而尤貴在於組織。以有組織之精神，發揮有祖織之人力，利用有組織之物質，方足以適應國家當前之需要。</p>
<p>因此精神動員必須以全民動員物質動員人力動員為基礎，因此精神動員必需要以發揮組織的力量為目的。</p>
<p>幫助全民總動員的進行</p>
<p>精神總動員在抗戰中佔有很重要的作用，對於堅持持久戰，堅持統一戰綫，爭取最後勝利更有非常大的意義，因此中國×××在六中全會决議說到全中華民族當前的緊急任務時，第一個任務就提出了：『高度的發揚民族自尊心與自信心，堅决抗戰到底，克服悲觀失望情緒——僅對投降妥協』。中國×××在抗戰以前就估計到了民族精神對發動神聖抗日戰爭的重要作用，歷來就反對民族失敗主義及民埃悲觀主義，反對喪失民族自信心和自尊心的『恐日病』，在抗戰爆發以後更是屢次的指出提高民族精神提高民族自尊心自信心，激發每個中國人對白×的民挨仇恨，提倡為國家為民族的犧牲精神，提倡精誠團結的精神，提倡民主合作的精神，為民族竭忠盡孝的革命精神，為抗戰建國為三民主主義的澈底實現為抗戰最後勝利而奮鬥的精神。</p>
<p>在抗戰的目前階段上因為在××的叛黨賣國，公開的投降日×，為日×策劃　炸中國的城市，為日×策劃攻擊中國，充當日×走狗。因為一些失意政客官潦軍閥公開的充當日×的傀儡，叛變中國的民族，喪失民族氣節，敗壞民埃道德：因為一些妥協投降份子，喪失對抗戰的信心，公開的或關蔽的破壞中國抗我的事業，破壞團結統一的事業，他們想犧牲民族的利益來投降日×，由於這一切的情形，在目前加緊精神動員。實在是非常必要的，經過精神動員來粉碎一切漢奸傀儡汪××等等的行動，揭破一切妥協求和的思想。</p>
<p>在自前抗戰中，由於×人的政治分化陰謀的加緊，由於×人『速戰速决』的戰略巳被打破，而『速和速結』的陰謀又屢吿失敗，×人必然要採取更多的政治陰謀，來挑撥我民族的團結，分化我民族的團結，搖動我抗戰的决心和勝利的信心，以圖　到屈服我民族滅亡我民族的毒計。如綱領內明說：『×人今日、巳知軍事力量不足以屈服吾人而達其速决之目的故其最近計劃，乃欲以種種方法搖動吾人之志，威脅吾人之精神』</p>
<p>當着×人施用種種政洽陰謀破壞我國抗戰的時候是毫無疑問的，也無需證明的。</p>
<p>這裏發生的問題，就是侵略的國家和被侵略的國家，全國總動員是否有基本原則和方法的差別呢，是有的，而且一定會有的，因為侵略的戰爭與反對侵略的戰爭是基本原則上的差別，基本性質上的差別。</p>
<p>因為××主義侵略者所進行的戰爭、是非止義的，侵略的戰爭，其目的是在為着財政資本的利益，其目的是在侵略和奴役別的國家，別的民族，同時也是在加深和延長對自己的興家內的人民的奴役和壓逼，因此這種戰爭，必然遭受國內人民的反抗，得不到國內人民的同情。××主義侵略者為要壓逼和强制國內人民來進行為財政資本的利益的戰爭，必然要在國內實行一個極端反侵的政策來進行全國總動員。</p>
<p>從日本××主義在對華的侵略戰爭中所實行的『日本國家總動員法案』及『精神總動員』，就可以完全看到日本總動員法案的實行，就是要榨取日本工人和農民以及勞動羣衆最後一滴血汗，在『寡集國防工作人員』之下，實行對日本工人的軍事勞役，在『國家動員法』之下掠奪農民的馬匹，米麥芻秣，大批抽丁，强迫增稅，濫發紙幣強行攤銷公債，在『精神總動員』之下，大批日本敎授學生自由職業文化界被捕，實行對日本反戰團體和反戰份子大加屠殺和鎭壓，大批的搜查燒燬社會科學的書籍以及一切含有反對戰爭的書籍，封閉一切同情中國不滿戰爭的言論機關。『日本的國家動員法案』及『精神總動員』是在皮鞭，刺刀，屠殺，監牢，逮捕，封閉之下進行的，日本法西斯侵略者的動員，不僅引起了日本工人農民勞動者自由職業者的强烈的反抗，而且也引起了中小資產階級及部份的自由資產階級的反抗。日本法西斯侵略者的皮鞭，刺刀，屠殺，監牢，逮捕，封閉，並不能使日本的全國動員順利的進行，並不能阻止日本人民的反戰運動的增漲，並不能阻止日本人民反對『動員法案』的運動。日本法西斯軍閥之所以要採取這種方法來實行全國總動員，是由它的侵略戰爭的性質所决定的。</p>
<p>中國的抗戰，是正義的，反對侵略的，民族解放的戰爭，其目的是在為着中國民族和中國人民解放的利益，其目的是在保衛自己民族自己的人民，其目的是在抵抗日本法西斯的侵略，抵抗日本法西斯對中國人民的奴役。因此種戰爭，必然取得全國人民一致的擁護。因此我們所要實行的全國人民總動員和精神總動員，必須是與民族解放的政策相符合的。</p>
<p>我們要實行全國總動員和精神總動員，是在全國人民一致擁護和一致參加抗戰的基礎上，來更大的發揚和帮助人民發揮更多的力量，來供獻給國家民族，以求得整憫抗戰的勝利，抗戰的利益是與全國全民埃人民的利益相符台，而且抗戰的利益是全民族全國人民當前最高的利益。因此，我們中國所進行的全國總動員和精神動員絕對不是也不會是如日本一樣在皮鞭，刺刀，屠殺，監牢，逮捕，封閉之下來進行的，而是與日本所進行的方法完全相反的。我國全國總動員和精神動員進行的方法，是在政府領導之下，政府帮助之下，全國人民自願的來參加，而且是積極的來參加，正如綱領內對『動員實施』的辦法所說：『精神動員之實施，大部份有利於每個國民良知之自覺。而相互之勉勵與啟發，則為助成其自覺之手段。至於法紀糾絕，僅當以之輔佐啓發與勉勵之所不及，故主要工作，重在倡導與宣傳敎化之合宜』，這種依據自覺自願之原則，啟發與勉勵，倡導與宣傳之方法正是我國進行全國動員精神總動員之基本原則和方法。這種動員的原則和方法，只有在正義的戰爭中才可能，而正義的戰爭又必需採用這種動員的原則和方法。</p>
<p>由此此見見因為戰爭的性質完全不同，產生所進行的全國總動員，包括精神動員在內，在原則上在方法上都是有基本的區別，忽視這種區別，就等於忽視中國的抗戰是解放戰爭是革命戰爭的性質，就等於忽視正義的戰爭與非正義的戰爭之間的天淵的區別。</p>
<p>有人提議我們所進行的精神總動晨要去參考×人所進行的精神總動員，這些成是由於拘泥遇事想模倣別人的成見，或是由於不懂得中國所進行的抗戰與日本的侵略戰爭有基本的區別，但是無論如何我們所進行的全國總動員，用不着去參考日本法西斯在皮鞭，刺刀，屠殺，監牢逮捕，封閉之下所進行的全國總動員，這是不用證明的。我們進行全國總動員和精神總動員，要按照民族解放的政策來實行，這一定能達到順利的進行，取得一定的效果，達到保證抗戰的勝利。</p>
<p>二　精神總動員的意義和內容</p>
<p>在說明了精神總動員在目前抗戰中的重要性後，在說明了全國總動員與精神總動員的關係後，在說明了全國總動員在保證抗戰勝利的作用後，在說明了由於戰爭的性質不同而產生全國德動員和績神總動員的基本原則上和方法上的差別後，由此可見精神總動員之意義，就在於集中全國人民各種不相同的意志思想於一個共同的目標——抗戰建國的事業上，就在於團結各級階層，各黨派，各職業。各民族等等各補不同之思想來反對一個共同的×人——日本××主義，在綢領的緒論中就指出：</p>
<p>『所謂國民精神動員者，自其字義言之，則在個人為集中其一切意識，思維，智慧與精神力量於一個方向而提高使用之，在國民全體為集中一切年齡，職業，思想，生活各不相同之國民的精神力量於一個共同目標而共同鼓舞以增進之，整齊調節以發揮之，確定組織之中心，以增强發揮之效率者也』。</p>
<p>由此可見精神總動員之意義，每在於不分黨派，不分階級，不分職業，不分信仰，不分年齡，不分性別，不分民族等等一致的團結起來，集中於這些不同人羣的各種不同的思想於一個方同——反對日本××主義，於一個共同目標——抗戰建國，『而提高使用之』，『而共同　舞以增進之』。</p>
<p>現在我們再來說明在抗戰中精神總動員的內容，這在國防最高委員會所宣佈的『國民精神總動員綱領』中，巳有概括的叙述，在這個綱領中，列舉了『共同目標』，『救國之道德』，『建國之信仰』，『精神之改選』，『動員領導』，『動員實施』，等等各項。在共同之目標中舉出：『（一）國家至上民族至上。（二）軍事第一勝利第一，（三）意志集中力量集中』。</p>
<p>在一個空前未有的神聖的民族解放戰爭中，在一個被侵略的國家在一個半殖民地的中國，民族思想和國家觀念，對於民族的獨立解放是佔有革命的意義，尤其在我們的國家內部份的囿有於個人的利益，甚至完全沒有民挨國家的觀念，他們常是走向為×人當漢奸和賣國賊的道路上去，因此，高度的發揚民族精神，高度的發揚愛國精神，這是非常的需要的，只有這才是『民族至上國家至上』的眞正意義，沒有高度的民族精神和愛國精神要進行一個長期的勝利的民族解放戰爭是不可能，沒有民族思想就是不會有民挨解放運動的。而且我們所進行的抗戰是與一個强大的日本××主義作戰。　戰勝這個東方最××的侵略者，必須要一切為着前綫，一切為着勝利，這就『軍事第一勝利第一』的眞正意義，同樣我們要能在長期的抗戰中爭取抗戰的勝利，必須集中一切意志，動員一切力量，以爭取抗戰的最後勝利，這就是『意志集中力量集中』的眞正意義。</p>
<p>在這個共同目標之下，進行全國的精神動員，正是加强抗戰力量動員的一種方法。抱定抗戰到底的决心堅持抗戰勝利的信心，高度的發揚民族精神和愛國精神，提高對民族的自尊心和自信心，供献自的力量國家的力量一切為着前線一切為着勝利，對政治的改進對民衆運動的發展，對戰時生活的建立集中一切意志動員一切力量為着爭取抗戰的最後勝利，中國領士主權之絕對完整，中國民族的獨立解放，三民主義新中國之建立。</p>
<p>爲着對於『國民精神總動員綱領』之解釋，吏能抓住中心內容，作正確的了解，深入民衆，使這個運動更容易進行，我想把這個綱領所述敍的內容概括的可分為下列的內容：</p>
<p>（一），對　持抗戰的决心；</p>
<p>（二），對抗戰勝利之信心；</p>
<p>（三），對民族的自信心和自尊心；</p>
<p>（四），對政治的改進；</p>
<p>（五），對民衆運動之發展；</p>
<p>（六），對戰時生活的建立。</p>
<p>（一）就對堅持抗戰的决心來說——，是我們精神動員的一個中心，因為國民精神總動員的目的就是要達到堅持抗戰到底的决心，一些對，戰動，的份子，投降　協的份子，他們就是根本沒有堅持抗戰的决心，他們從抗戰第一天起就是反對抗戰，或是對抗戰的動搖。如民族叛逆汪××之流，從抗戰開始，就對抗戰沒有決時，每遇抗戰遭受困難時則公開主張投降，最後公開的叛變中國民族而投降日×。而一些對抗戰動搖的份子，時刻對堅持抗戰之國策表示反對和懷疑，想用各種的方法走向和平妥協的道路。如綱領中所說：『民族精神之建立，必求其堅忍不拔，貞固不移，苟一遇外來之壓迫與誘惑卽行動搖，則此精神仍不足以完成非常之事業。』堅定全國人民對抗戰的决心，乃是精神動員一個重要的任務，怎樣才能達到堅定抗戰的决心，這裏中心點就是要把抗戰的形勢能够普遍的深入的解釋，而解釋的中心是在使每個人腦筋中存着有一個『日本是我們，×人』的觀念，就是發揚『有×無我』『不共戴天之仇』之精神，使全國人民懂得，日本這個×人一日不除，我們抗戰的責任一日未了，而我們抗戰的决心一日不能放棄。</p>
<p>（二）就對抗戰的信心來說——這又是堅定抗戰的决心的必嬰的條件，如果抗戰沒有前途，如果抗戰沒有勝利的前途，那麽自然要堅持抗戰的决心是很困難。因此在精神總動員中必須對中國抗戰能够取得勝利的條件和前途作詳細的具體的解釋，這就是綱領中所說的『要事第一勝利第一』，軍事之唯一的目的在求得勝利，則國民務須確立必勝之信念，達成最後勝利的目的。』我們抗戰的目的，就是要取得抗戰的勝利，有了對抗戰勝利的信心，則對堅持抗戰决心愈亦鞏固。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c2">×機濫炸重慶事件 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>五月三日四日，×機濫炸重慶，造成人類史上空前慘劇，我們遙望新都，數千同胞，慘遭粉身碎骨之禍、數萬同胞，突受破家蕩產之苦：誠不知涕淚之何從！而外國使領館署友邦各界人士，亦竟同遭無妄之災，此在我們，尤有不勝痛苦之情！雖然，我們對於重慶此次空前浩刦，實有作進一步觀察之必要。</p>
<p>×人此次對我戰時首都重慶之狂轟濫炸，决非簡單的軍事上行為，而包含有相當重大的政治陰謀在內。日×此種×行之目的，第一是要以此種×行來誇示日軍尙有繼續進攻及毀滅一切的力量，而企圖××</p>
<p>××英方輕視我國的抵抗力，重視日×的威脅力，改變援華政策，調停抗日戰事，壓迫我國屈服。第二是想用這種×行來威脅及懾伏我國政府與民衆，走上×等投降賣國的『反共』『議和』之路，走上屈服亡國的『和平』『調解』之路。因此，如果我們抗戰一日不停，如果中國一日不亡，則日×此種×行亦必一日繼續，一日加強，狂炸重慶只是開始，寧波福州潮汕之先後慘遭轟炸，原因亦屬如此。今後日×也許還有更××更××的×行。有如日海軍省發言人六日所稱，『日機三次襲重慶，及其他據點，將予繼續，且將加強』（路透社七日東京電）。</p>
<p>不過我們每一個不願做奴隸的中國人巳經認識淸楚，而且每一個國際上的有識之士亦巳認識淸楚，日本××主義的侵華軍事，業巳遭受二十二個月堅强的抵抗而開始進入重大困難之境，現在日本侵華『事業』，不論軍事的投機冒險或政治的『反共』『和平』『調解』，都巳遭受中國政府軍隊和全體人民的打擊，此種打擊的力量，還在一天天的增強。隨着此種抗日力量的增强，日本侵略者的內部尤其是軍隊內部的危機則日益嚴重，日本侵略者在國際的地位則日趨孤立與危岌。在這種新的形勢之下，日本侵華『事業』，只有進入慘敗而至於萬刼不復一途，巳是不卜可知的事實。日本×人為要挽囘這種末運，便不顧一切，採取更××的手段，因此重慶等地之慘遭狂炸，不能作為日本軍事力量未受更大打擊的證據，更不能作為日本軍事力量尙能如其在第一期作戰中所誇示的『長軀直入，所向無敵』的證據，而且事實且恰恰相反，是證明了日×之窘極跳牆！我們每一個不願做亡國奴的同胞，不僅不致因而憂懼，相反的却將益增仇恨日×之力，益增抗戰勝利信心，我們相信友邦人士亦必同具此種認識而益堅援華制日之心。</p>
<p>我們所仍要在此向華僑讀者與各界領袖特別指出的是：第一，日×此種×行，隨着軍事上相持階段的日漸完成，隨着日×侵華軍事及政治困難的日漸嚴重，而將有更××更××更××的演出！因此我們一面要加緊重慶等地的善後工作，一面要加緊一切預防工作。關於前者，我們應該立刻進行慰問和慕捐救濟等等工作，慰問工作務求熱烈普遍，募捐工作則須認眞切實，而由國家銀行與會計機關的公開辦理。關於後者，則應加緊動員靑年及專家囘國服務，增強前線力量，增强後方防衛；尢應加緊捐輸運動，增强我國防空防毒工具，培植大批防空防毒人才。第二，×人此種×行，尤其是此次重慶各友邦使館領署之慘遭禍害，事實俱在，决非×人關言辯白所能掩飾。此種×行不僅為對中國人民與國際人士的威脅，亦是對全體正義人類的威脅與侮辱！因此我們要搜集具體材料，尤其是我國民衆外人產業被炸慘况，擴大國際宣傳工作，爭取國際更大的同情與援助。</p>
<p>最後，我們敬向重慶等地被炸難胞友邦人士與大公新華新蜀四川等各報，表示無限的同情，與無限的敬意！我們深信你們今日的犧牲痛苦是有鉅大代價的，我們全國民衆全體僑胞和全世界正義人士都將為你們最忠誠最熱烈的後援者！</p>

<p>二期抗戰中的異彩</p>

<p>卅一日上午三時起，×復不斷向祥符觀方面　擊，均擊退，正午×步兵千餘，砲四門，復向　花山猛攻，間放毒氣，激戰　午後九時，我某連官長，全部陣亡，然各士兵仍能死守陣地，將×擊退，此種沉著果敢的戰鬥精神，實為二期抗戰史上放一異彩。</p>

<p>×于攻略蓮花山祥符觀，皆遭失敗後，乃復增加兵力千餘，于卅一日晚十時，利用月夜，以全力轉向祥符觀蓮花山中間地區，沿古大道向祥符觀西北四華里楊家坊陣地猛攻，集中炮大施放毒氣，並將戰車七八十輛，利用古大道接近我陣地，集中射擊，扼守該處我李　林運官兵傷亡僅剩七人，連長亦陣亡，×隨佔領楊家坊以西高地。但此時我扼守對山的上士班長任俊安，仍率士兵六人守住陣地，不稍後移，一面派兵報吿，一面射擊，×因之于突破我陣地後，仍未能向左右席捲，嗣×××旅長得報，親率預備隊逆襲，激戰澈夜，×未得再進。</p>
<p>四月一日拂曉；×仍施行席　計劃，企圖擴張戰果，×旅長復親率所部，奮不顧身，出入第一綫，勇猛掃蕩。×死傷逾千，我亦傷亡頗鉅，乃突有達姆薩姆彈自×陣射來，×旅長腿部遂受重傷，×得繼續突入七八百人，附戰車七八十輛，幸此時其餘陣地尙無動搖，僅楊家坊成混戰狀態，乃得一方增兵，將突入×驅除，一方令××部部署，第二綫預備陣地。</p>
<p>×因受我兩翼夾擊，及正面混戰，淮展頗為遲滯，鏖戰及晚，終以堵擊匪易，尤以高安東北，土埠相望，時有斷續，傾斜邋綏，易于攀登，戰車到處均可活動，我為避免與共决戰，乃依旣定計劃，于二日轉進至高安城西五里地區，×于三日晨始陸續進城。</p>
<p>四日起，×雖數度向西肆擾，皆受創而回，六日，我趁×一部他調，突反攻，七日晨　迫高安城郊，×自北將西南兩門緊閉，東門開半扇，居民連行者僅北門。</p>
<p>何以×之傷亡反倍于我</p>
<p>此役共歷八日，×死傷逾三千，我傷亡不過于三百餘，×之傷亡反倍于我，這不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>（一）×攻我守，攻擊的傷亡，往往比守衛大。</p>
<p>（二）×一〇六師團經去年十月德安慘敗，雖整修四月，戰鬥力巳遠較去歲為削弱，卽其使用輕重機槍，亦多連續射擊，不諳斷續射擊，證明訓練尙差。</p>
<p>（三）×機砲多用于攻略南昌，用于高安方面，砲僅十二門，飛機以陰雨連綿，央活動能力，遂只有退而倚仗大量毒氣，先後放射，凡廿餘次，但毒氣戰鬥的勝敗，並沒有决定的作用，反之，轉增加我敵愾之士氣。</p>
<p>（四）我軍抗戰情精的高漲，士氣的旺盛，作戰沉着勇敢，實至令人可泣可歌，如劉大明團附的指揮部隊，勇敢衝鋒，帶傷服務；柳朝昌排長身先士卒，指揮沉着；通訊連上士排附李俊的受×包圍，仍將電話總機携出；上士班長魏世杰在祥符觀戰鬥時，率士兵將已失高地奪囘，陣地賴以轉危為安；上士班長　君明于×砲毒氣包圍下傷亡慘重之際，仍固守陣地兩晝夜；上等兵劉永海，於班長負傷工事全毀，來領全班固守不退；中尉排長龐嵩山，于連長陣亡之後，仍固守據點，沉着應變，穩定戰局。——這種種壯烈的事蹟，實是此役大量消滅××的最大原因，也就是爭取最後勝利的最大保證。</p>
<p>××于攻佔南昌後，西向僅止于高安，這或許是××戰略的决定，但其不能擴張戰果，繼續西進，未嘗不是由于高安之役，×軍還着意想不到的鉅大頓挫的緣故。（按高安已子四月廿三日克復此信无五日發出，故未扭及。）廿八，四，十八。（完）</p>

<p>（美聯社土京六日電）安哥拉方面報告、英土協定完成、合作維護地中海安全、至協定之條件、則將於星期一日、在士國會及英下院席上、同時宣布、所有經過情形、均曾隨時通知蘇聯政府、士外交部次長、啣有政府新訓令、巳於本日下午忽忽趕往奠斯科、未起程前、渠會與各領袖密祕會談、</p>
<p>（中央社巴黎六日電）此間頃接獲士耳其京城消息，據稱，蘇聯人民外交副委長波丹金、與士國當局所討論者、乃以中東歐各國防禦問題為主、東方羅加諾公約各簽字國、卽伊拉克、伊朗，土耳其，阿富汗四國，近在德里蘭城舉行會議恃、曾經議决授權土國，得代表各該　在外交上有所發動，而蘇聯與阿富汗，伊朗，土耳其三國，亦皆瓖七相接，自有輔車相依之勢，</p>

<p>【海通社倫敦七日電】英國致蘇聯政府復牒、昨下午遞與蘇使邁斯基轉達、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦六日電】據官方公佈、英國之新提案、目的在羅致蘇聯加入英法安全陣線、現因「有再度考慮之必要」，巳延遲發出、前雖曾傳巳致交英駐蘇大使西慈爵士、尙非事實、但不久之將來、卽可送出張伯倫個人親將該照會修改、另行起草、原有照會係不接納蘇聯提議之軍事互助協定、但仍保留最後成立軍事協約之餘地、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦六日電】蘇大使本日離開英外交部數分鐘後、哈立法克斯卽往首相邸，討論內閣外交委員會建議書、及與邁斯基談商之經過、午膳前外長亦與外次賈得幹討論時局、政界消息、英國對蘇聯最後改正之覆文、似有妥協之意、英國仍主張蘇聯應單獨答允援助東歐被侵略國家、倘蘇聯答應此事、則三强軍事同盟、或有成立可能、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦七日電】本日各報之社論及各外交訪員之報吿、均注重於英、蘇談判、大部之意見、均認為該項談判、已至危急階段、因英政府僅願與蘇聯成立協定、當波羅的海及巴爾幹諸國、將受攻擊時，蘇聯出而援助、但蘇聯則堅持英、法、蘇三國成立軍事協定、而以東西歐之小團隸附之、『星期太晤士報』外交訪員稱、除非蘇聯準備妥協、否則此次談話，將有宣吿破裂之危險、渠幷稱、『英土協定之最後結論、實緊於英、蘇談判之中也』、『觀察報』外交訪員則稍、『蘇聯曾堅持表示、諸小國家期待正殷、希望和平集團確屬負有功効、而可加以依賴者、而此則非三强國充份軍事聯盟、不足以慰彼等之望、如三國始終猶豫不前、諸小國家或又將旦夕不保矣、英國之困難、則以為正式之軍事聯盟、足以為德國視為包圍政策之藉口、反足以引起竭力避免之危機，同時蘇聯方面、則認為若無充份之聯盟、亦足以引起危機，因此、此項問題已成為互相運用手段之階段矣、『觀察報』之社論稱，『當和平集團之組織、方今肇始、英政府必須自答此項問題、半途方法是否有效、或反致使目下之局勢、更壞於前』云、</p>
<p>【美聯社巴黎六日電】此間官方、對英國拒絕蘇聯提議成立軍事同盟及抵抗希特勒、表示失望、同時法國再度聲言、維持一九三五年法、蘇互助公約、聞莫斯科方面、曾通吿法國、蘇聯並無意採取孤立主義或與德國妥協、據法國意見、英國拒絕蘇聯提案、並非卽謂英，法共同保證德國四周之各國土地完整之行動，巳吿失敗、</p>
<p>【美聯社巴黎六日電】法國外交部長本日向法內閣報吿與波、蘇、羅、土四國進行談判、成立和平陣線之經；幷解釋英國對蘇聯提議成立三强軍事同盟之反提案、復稱敎皇為和平之努力、法內閣通過六項法令、由總統　白倫簽發、該項法令包括國防準備、及取締法國內之外國報紙、</p>

<p>【路透社巴黎六日電】據可靠報吿、德轟炸機大批　中於波蘭邊境附近，消息傳來、法國輿情雖極震動、然猶希望可以避免緊張局面之再度增加、法方頗有希望意國出任調人之傾向、法國方面希望因莫索里尼不願對波作戰之故、能自動勸希特勒另取較為緩和之策略、除此之外，各方對斯洛伐克問題亦極為注意、緣在接近波蘭工業中心之斯洛伐克境，軍事之調動極形頻繁、各方對此之所以重視、實有兩種原因、（一）因其侵犯波蘭致命點之威脅、（二）今日盛傳德外長里賓特羅甫及意外相齊亞諾　共同討論德意匈瓜分斯洛伐克之問題、最後所接關於德軍之情報、略謂、飛機及其他用品、巳大量集中於波蘭邊境、據悉、波方亦巳有所準備、但德軍集中於波蘭邊境之數目，並非極大、故暫時或不致立卽進犯波蘭、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林六日電】威廉街至今尙拒絕發表德國對於粕克演說之態度、納粹報紙上並未有一字評述、柏克之演說及波蘭答覆德國廢止德波協定備忘錄之復文、現正在詳細研究中，據悉，希特勒將靜觀英、美兩國對此之反響如何，然後冉行發表其個人之意見、惟納粹黨政界方面、特別提出四點。加以討論、（一）彼等對於但澤民族自决權利、特別加以說明、（二）彼等拒絕接受因但澤位於維斯杜拉河口、故波蘭在但澤實有莫大權益之見解，（三）彼等認為德波協定中規定締約國任何一方不得自由與其他國家聯合以敵對其他締約國、（四）彼等對於柏克所稱、德國建議並未將全文交付波蘭一語、表示　異、</p>
<p>【海通社柏林六日電】德國人士之注意、不集中於波外長柏克之演詞、而集中於威廉街之活動、其對於現有歐局之對策、可用『擊破英國包圍陣綫』一語表示之、德國之外交政策、乃置其他一切於次要地位、卽專與英國作外交爭鬥、此巳日愈明瞭矣、為達到此目的計，德國之外交政策或將出人意料、重定方針、惟一切須視德外長里賓特羅甫與意外相齊亞諾之會晤結果如何耳、里賓特羅甫昨晚曾在慕尼黑希特勒山頂別墅中謁希特勒後、始啓程赴意、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林六日電】據此間政界方面之意、關於但澤問題、目前不致有任何重要之决議、但亦頗有主張但澤舉行公民投票者、認為但澤歸還德國、抑維持自由市之現狀、應由民衆自决、消息靈通者曾勉强證實、希特勒昨日確會與但澤國社黨領袖格拉沙及福爾斯達會談、是則里賓特羅甫此次前往米蘭、早巳獲悉但澤領袖之願望，及携有希特勒之訓令矣、</p>
<p>【路透社波京六日電】此間『日報』著論稱、『全世界業巳一致公認、德國果欲與波蘭覓求諒解者，卽當提供切實之證據。今者波蘭旣巳表明態度、則此時應俟德國發言矣』、『波蘭日報』亦謂、『柏林現當從兩途中自選其一，兩迷之一卽為和平之路』、保守派之代表報『沙斯報』則謂，德大使摩爾基昨日之重返波京、或卽德方有所建議云、波國會全體大會巳定九日召開、藉以論將討頒佈撥用款項充實國防之特權授予總統一案、參院定十一日召開全體大會、</p>

<p>【路透社梵諦岡七日電】敎皇本日在阿爾及爾向法國國民聖餐會、發表廣播演說、略述、人類確切企望和平、敎皇表示、五月中將盡力作廣泛之祈禱，冀望聖母能自蒼天擲予吾人以和平、吾人現正殷望錯誤政策及紛亂早日吿終、而靈魂之和平、與世界之和平、盍興乎、</p>
<p>【路透社梵諦岡六日電】明日敎皇廣播演說之性質，雖未有所聞、然據此間人士之意、則謂敎廷駐德代表之訪問里賓特羅甫、實與德、波糾紛有特殊之關係、聖城當局亟願獲覩此事之朴平解决、並聞　竭力向各方斡旋、以期開闢談判之路、而防止其中斷、敎廷方面之努力雖未能謂為有若何切實之效果、然仍繼續在歐洲各中心運甩其外交之活動、為和平努力、一般推測、敎廷業與柏林恢復接觸、其目的在獲致德國與聖城間彼此之諒解，</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎六日電】巴黎大主敎凡爾第、將於明日向阿爾及爾舉行之聖餐大會、發表重要聲明、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦六日電】據今日巴黎方面消息、梵諦岡現正以最大之努力、斡旋歐洲和平、又據另一消息稱、法外長曾向內閣報吿昨日巴黎大主敎凡爾第往訪經過、同時柏林大主敎亦曾往訪希特勒、故敎皇幹旋和平一舉、益信而有徵、敎皇明日向阿爾及爾聖餐大會播音演說時、對於此舉、或將有所表示，</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎六日電】自法外長向閣議提出報吿後、此間認為敎皇巳採取外交步驟、協助和平解决德、波紛爭、駐法敎庭代表昨日訪龐萊後、駐德敎庭代表亦訪德國當局，此間認為此舉實與敎皇干預但澤問題有關云、</p>

<p>【路透社米蘭六日電】今日意、德兩外長會談、相信但澤問題為談話中之主題，</p>
<p>【路透社羅馬六日電】官方機關報『外交情報』論及今日里賓特羅甫及齊亞諾之會商、謂米蘭談話結果、將不至有任何驚人事件發生、惟將重申軸心國家準備抵抗包園政策之决心，此不能謂為戰爭之要素、而實為和平之工具也</p>
<p>【中央社米蘭七日電】據法西斯方面消息，意大利仍主張德、彼談判應繼續進行、以期但澤問題得以解决、莫索里尼認為德、、波成立諒解之希望、幷不因柏克之演說而吿消滅云，衆信莫索里尼及敎皇方面、皆有調停德、波糾紛之意、</p>
<p>【路透社羅馬六日電】『笛報』今日之評論稱、意國明望德國表現緩和、一如其期望波蘭之切，其言有曰：『欲求正義之申張、必須彼此排除爭霸之念、實則協定巳半底於成、　彼此均巳表速和平之意』，</p>
<p>【海通社羅馬六日電】意報依據官方態度，而將柏克之演說與德報之論調相比較、其結論認為談判之　尙未關閉、某報並謂柏克有言、『德國祇提出要求、而並無實際建議』，意卽邀請德國提供建議、希特勒倘能接納其激請、則談判卽可進行，而有關各國亦可同感滿意云、</p>

<p>二十多年以來，中國民衆為剷除這一恥辱的烙印而在雙重壓迫下艱苦奮鬥。直到前年『七七』『八一三』以後，才因國共合作與實現了中央與地方，政府與民衆，各族民各階層的空前大團結；才因國共合作而實現了中華民族全體一致的展開了抗日戰爭。</p>
<p>但是，剷除烙印不能不經過極大的痛苦，而在這種痛苦的奮鬥過程中，難免有意志薄弱者的動搖與、縮,難免有不肖份子之屈服於×人的威脅與利誘；因此，我們在二十多年以後紀念五月九日這個痛苦恥辱的日子，仍舊要於共同反抗侵略者以外，要同時盡力反舉那些夢想做袁世凱第二的特別是要警防汪××之流所策動的『反共和平』等陰謀！</p>
<p>侵略者及其鷹犬是最害怕我們之　除烙印而自由獨立於文明人類之　的！侵略者及其鷹犬是最害怕我們之團結統一堅持抗戰爭使全民族從恥辱苦難之下自由獨立起來的！他們正在以軍事的冒險政治的陰謀和瘋狂的轟炸和××來加傑我們所受的恥辱之烙印與殘酷的壓迫！這是我們在這恥辱之烙印的紀念日所要加倍警惕與加倍努力的。我們要在明年的五月九日，熱烈地慶祝這個『雪恥日』！</p>

<p>今天報載路透社倫敦電，說英國上議院議員里斯杜威氏等四人和下議院議員，潘恩氏等三十二人，拍電向我蔣委員長致敬。電文中特別宣佈他們對我全國人民軍隊為民族獨立統一自由而鬥爭，表示同情與敬禮；電文中還特別宣佈他們公認中國抗日戰爭，實為世界反侵略鬥爭的主力軍，同時亦為保衛歐洲的和平。因而更表示深切的同情與敬禮。</p>
<p>我們從這個電報，更可認淸我們二十二個月的堅持抗戰，巳經怎樣地提高了中國人民和中國政府領袖在國際上的地位！我們更可認淸，我們二十二憫月的堅持抗戰巳經怎樣助益於世界而且影響了世界！我們相信今後這種國際的同情援助和堅持抗戰對於世界和平事業的貢献，必將有更偉大的成就！我們要在這裏益堅擁護領袖堅持抗戰的决心，並且要更加努力推進國際反法西斯反侵略陣線。我們要知道我們在國際上同情援助的增加，事實上也就是抗日力量的增加，而將提前最後勝利的來臨！</p>

<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>據孤立派之意見。美國之行政元首，凡主張積極參預世界政治者，在憲法約東之下，仍有未經國會之正式程序而導國家於實際戰爭的危險境界之慮，以海堅軍大元帥之資格，總統有隨時訓令其兵員艦隊前往任何區域之權，在不宣而戰風行一時之今日，此權難免不致誤用，此其一。中立法之原旨，本在自潔其身，以為避免牽入國際戰爭漩渦之張本。顧卽就賅法之條文而言，美國總統對於並未宣戰之國家，乃可以宣佈某國巳入於戰爭狀態為理由，而與之斷絕往還，結果遂致惹起該國對美之非難或敵對行為，此其二。根據關稅法令，在某種情形下，美糖統可以關稅報復之手段而使美國與他國間之貿易歸於中斷，此其二，如總統蓄意干預世界政治，凡與外國代表接觸時，彼大可以接納某種義務之約束，或故意惹起對方之憤怒，一旦事發，國人為維持其國家尊嚴計，自不得不為其後盾，此其四，上言種種雖為孤立派鼓吹削弱總統權力之口實，然客觀上適足以反映美總統對外權力相當之偉大，吾信高瞻遠矚之羅斯福總統，必能善用其權力，使侵略者知所警惕也。　、蘇聯得天獨厚，自三次五年計劃相繼實施後，其資源業經相當開發，其重工業尤為突飛猛進，列强之中，堪談經濟自足者，美國而外，惟蘇聯耳，其為世界政治之一大因素，於斯槪見。</p>
<p>慕尼黑會議之絕大錯誤，厥為疏遠蘇聯，而冀於虛無　渺間、實現所謂四强協定之幻想，此乃軸心國家，尤其希特勒求之不得者，換言之，國際盟約中，使希特勒最感憂慮者，首推一九三五年五月二日成立之法蘇互助協定，良以此約一日不廢，一且歐戰再發，德國將必腹背受敵，一九一八年彼之所以功敗垂成者，是亦一大原因。無怪希特勒務求此約之廢棄而後快也。</p>
<p>茲者蘇俄友誼之可貴，不獨巳屢宣於英，法朝野之口；而雙方使節之往還，抑且日趨頻繁，覆水重收，固有賴於對俄猜疑之澈底捐棄；然事過情遷，蘇聯態度是否一仍舊貫，尤為合作之先决條件也。</p>
<p>蘇聯之外交態度備極鮮明。約而言之，卽除根據集體安全之原則，隨時準備與民主國家合作，以爲世界和平之保陣外；對於侵略國以戰爭之恫疑虛喝，藉遂其榨取大慾之黔驢劣技，則絕對不作絲毫之長縮退讓。第其對於民主國家，則不惜容忍遷就，委曲求全。一九二七年，當英蘇，法蘇關係緊張之際，史塔林特公開發表謂：『蘇聯當局務狽貫澈其和平政策，外來之刺激縱或有損於國家之尊嚴，吾人亦决忽略之。』此種堅忍遠大之主張迄仍未變，例如，蘇，法，捷間雖有互助條約之維緊，而慕尼黑會議對蘇竟故意　落，去冬之德，法友好宣言復至雙方署簽之夕（十二月五日），法國當局始將原文通知蘇聯。凡此『刺激』，本非强國所能容忍，而蘇俄仍以緘默處之，足證其維護和平之初衷，仍如嗎昔也。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c34">發揚『五四』精神　全港青年團體昨晚舉行　熱烈慶祝青年節　假孔圣堂開會到青年代表千余人　鐘天心勉青年加強修養動員民衆 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>『靑年節』是中國今年的新生的產物，是世界各國破天荒的一個新紀元。它是怎樣來的？又負什麽使命？答案很簡單：它是自從五四運動以來，靑年羣衆鬥爭得來的，它的使命應該發揚五四的精神，作為抗戰建國的先鋒與柱石。</p>
<p>『靑年節』成立的經過，是由三民主義靑年團呈請中央將『五四』作為『靑年節』，並從五月一日起至五月七日止——悲壯的五月最尖銳的一週——作為靑年運動宣傳週。本週運動的綱領『五一』是發動勞動服務，增加生產效率；「五二』是推進各種文化宣傳；『五三』是推進兵役工作等：『五四』是舉行紀念大會，重整潔，守紀律，守時間，務須為民衆表率：『五五』是提倡正當娛樂工作；『五六』是發動學術工作；『五七』是倡導靑年他育工作。所有工作內容皆與抗戰建國有密切聯系。並須普及各鄕村，以期深入與强化。</p>
<p>從此，我們可以了解從『學生』到『靑年』，從『局部的運動一到『加强靑年修養』而至於『參加民族解放鬥爭』。繼續開來，意義是多麽重大，靑年是多麽光榮！我們深深地為國家民族慶幸！</p>
<p>香港靑年雖然限於環境，未能像國內一樣如火如荼地發動偉大的工作；可是，在可能範圍內，仍然是艱苦地鬥爭着。</p>
<p>關于『五四靑年節』學賑會及各學校各靑年團體都有實際的行動表現，各淸巳誌前報。至於全港靑年團體聯合紀念靑年節，就在昨晚——靑年運動週最末的一天，亦是國恥紀念——在孔聖堂舉行了。</p>
<p>正是暮色蒼茫的時候，前面一夥，後面一隊，直向加里連山的大道邁進，歌聲，笑聲，走走跳跳，洋溢着天眞的熱情，生命的活躍。</p>
<p>會場的上下樓，坐滿了一千多位靑年朋友，學生佔多數，各靑年團體代表很不少。新聞學院全體同學亦參加，大家都是希冀在集體生活中加强自我敎育。捧着大會分發的『吿全港靑年書』；學賑會的『慶祝靑年節特刊』；及『自新運動公約』等，默默地讀着，微笑地接受着。</p>
<p>八時，主席團學賑會，靑年記者學會，男靑年會，女靑年會，惠陽靑年會，基督敎學聯會，及靑年同樂社七代表就座，嚴肅地進行開會的儀式。主席李政耀從五四光榮的歷史說到香港的靑年亦在大時代中進步起來。接着，說明大會的意義。一是擁領袖，團結靑年，參加民族解放鬥爭。二是改善靑年——特別是學生——的生活，使大家都嚴肅起來；前進起來。至於本身應負的責任：（一）加緊賑濟難民；（二）强化國際宣傳；（三）實行節約；（四）推進中英文化合作；（五）加强靑年大團結；（六）提高靑年社會地位。</p>
<p>接着，就是鍾天心先生演講。他從從容容地講述很多應該對靑年講的話；全體亦靜寂寂地聆敎着。</p>
<p>『少年』要能够像成年人一樣『老成』才是好少年，這是中國過去稱贊靑年的標準。鍾先生認為這是十分錯誤的。檢閱過去中國的歷史，從中山先生領導革命即起，至今次抗戰至，靑年有不可磨滅的功績，有偉大的貢獻。靑年節的意思就是要紀念過去光榮的歷史，策勵今後為國家民族而奮鬥。</p>
<p>接着，鐘先生以下面四　勗勉靑年：『先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂；持刀斧以增國富，執干戈以衛社稷』要是不這樣加强自身的修養，過了一個　期之後，就會喪失靑年人的氣質而墮落下去了。——這是很中肯的話，</p>
<p>最末，他說：今天剛值國恥紀念，我們應該怎樣以慶祝靑年節來紀念國恥，結論是動員靑年，充實靑年幹部，靑年一定會去動員民衆，民衆一定會發生偉大的力量來爭取最後勝利的早日降臨。——這是鐘先生幹過動員工作而重視靑年，重視民衆的經騐之談，全體報以熱烈的掌聲</p>
<p>加上歌詠的插曲，會場空氣由嚴肅而活潑起來。『中華民族不會亡！』『中華民族不會亡！』『……』從每個人心炊中喊出來，打動了每個人的心炊。</p>
<p>口琴會奏之後，世界基督敎學聯會副主席江文漢先生演說，他是從內地工作來的，說的亦很動人：第一，要認淸這個時代是偉大的時代；第二，精神的動員是一切動員工作的基礎：第三，認淸自身的地位與任務。</p>
<p>再行歌詠之後，鄭德超君介紹『靑年自新運動公約』，勉勵共同遵守，（一）提高興趣水準，選擇正當娛樂；（二）强化集團生活，促進紀律精神；（三）增濃研究興趣，鍛鍊科學頭腦；（四）革除奢侈惡習，養成節約習慣；（五）加深靈性修養，增進服務效果。全文共二十八條，巳詳載昨日本報，這是精紳動員一個具體的靑年，修養標準，熱烈鼓掌贊同，大家從行動上的表現再見吧。——十時許盡歡而散。（奇卓）</p>

<p>— 白水</p>
<p>定期舉行精神總動員宣誓</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>轟動一時的，黃花崗」聯演，在五月三日至五日一連三晚的演出了，又再為中國劇壇寫下光榮的記錄和不滅的偉史。</p>
<p>昨日下午一時許，香港戲劇界，黃花崗演出委員會，假中華兒童書院召開演出委員會會議，商磋各項問題，到會的有各劇團代表又大會各部各股職員，人數達半百之多</p>
<p>首先由各股各部報吿這次上演的工作情况及其他事項後，卽開始了幾件很有意義的討論。</p>
<p>這次聯演中不論那方面都非現得很努力，特別是幾位工作幹部貢默了最大的精神，犧牲珍貴的時間去完成這件鉅構的工作，但如果為了這樣而連累本身的生活或職業等，那我們應予以極大的同情和援助的。</p>
<p>因此：詹歌奮君的因公被撤職，大會就議决派胡春冰及李化兩位携大會公函前往解釋並求諒解。</p>
<p>這事是發揮了戲劇界集體的不可摧毀的力量啊！</p>
<p>「黃花崗」演出底收入是將達三千元，但因種種關係，致觀衆不能普及，是一件憾事；為了更廣大的推廣宣傳工作，和增加收入，低價重演是一致的要求。結果，經過大家討論的終結，都愿意和香港眼聯會再度合辦重演『黃花崗』。</p>
<p>在這當中，李殊倫君提出了一個非常珍貴的意見，就是歐陽予倩先生五十壽辰快到了，那麽最好把這一次的重演，並作為慶祝歐陽予倩先生五十毒辰的義演。</p>
<p>提起歐陽予倩先生，我們中國戲劇運動的拓荒者，在中國的劇壇上，他有着一頁最光榮的歷史，卅餘年，他始終以倔强沉毅的姿態鬥爭着，今年的五月二十日正是這位偉大藝人的五十壽辰，為了慶祝我們底戲劇先進，更為了給以廣大的後學者一個深切的學習，這意見的被提出立刻獲到了熱烈的贊同，幷决議在他底生辰的那天重演『黃花崗』。同時幷組織一『香港戲劇界慶祝歐陽予倩先生五十壽辰義演委員會』，負責今後工作及聯絡各方面共同行進</p>
<p>最後，李化君提出一個同樣富有意義的意見就是全香港戲劇界的精神總動員宣誓，大家很興奮和很莊重一致贊成，並决議在五月十四日（下星期日）上午九時召集全港戲劇界舉行精神總動員宣誓，並將組織一全港統一的健全的戲劇界組織機。</p>
<p>這眞太使人興奮得非常了，在血的鬥爭的五月中，香港戲劇工作者將以英勇果敢的行動答覆抗戰中的祖國底呼喚。</p>

<p>車如流水，船如游龍，式式具有</p>
<p>姑勿論香港的內裏。是否眞如所謂『文明』，但『香港是個近代的文明都市』的定義，早巳給一般人無條件的承認了，因是『文明』，各階層人類對奢華與虛榮慾的追求，便特別來得熱盛，而物質的享受，也格外『美備』而『無缺』，現在先談談香港和與它有連帶關係的，九龍的交通設備，但，這只是千萬物質享受中之一種而巳。</p>
<p>港九交通的設備，在精神上雖然還有很多需要掛評和改善的地方，但在物質方面，確是無可訾議的了。就交通工具而言，規模較大，而工程很巨的，有爬山的纜車，和走平地的電車，其次便是公共汽車，（香港稱做『巴士』以下仿此），與人力車了，這是比較大衆化的幾種，至於所謂『貴族化的』，除富人們專有的自用汽車而外，還有『的士』一種：不過這只是布爾喬亞階級的享用品，普羅大衆不輕易享受。再如你要別尋風味，而又欲不勞尊足的話，你還可優游自得傲態萬千的乘坐由兩個人扛着的『竹橋』，『蝸牛』式的行進，你可以慢慢欣賞風光；實際上，它巳經不成其為交通工具了。</p>
<p>這裏交通工具，旣然是這樣的完善，那麽，只要你的腰包有錢，你大可以不勞尊足，而安然達到你所需要去的目的地，所以老於香港的人，常常會高傲地對人說，在香港走路任憑怎樣也不會『迷途』，不過這種說法，祇是他們個人『經騐之談』，實則初到『貴境』的人。依然像軍霧下的孤舟，茫然不知所以，尤其是自從祖國的神聖自衛抗戰展開以得，這裏增加了一批『避難』的同胞，他們大都來自北方，和西南各地，其中一生未　到過香港的也很多，他們對於香港的認識，格外來得隔膜與幼穉。在人地生疏的情况之下，要他認識複雜的社會情形，固然是一件十分困難的事，但單要明瞭一般交通的狀况，如果沒有人從旁指導的話，恐怕也不大容易，『港九的交通綫』，也許是我專為他們而寫的。在老香港看來，這自然是『班們弄斧』，但我想假如給一般陌生看了，正是求之不得吧！</p>
<p>先說香港，，這裏的『巴士』，由中華　車公司承辦，一共分選七號路綫：第一號為油蔴地碼頭至跑馬地綫，經過康樂道，美利道，皇后大道中和東，軍器廠街，灣仔道，麽利臣山道，黃泥涌道，而到終點，第二號油蔴地碼頭至太古船澳綫，經康樂道，美利道，皇后大道東，軍噐廠街，洛克道，波斯富街，軒尼詩道，高士威道，及英皇道，第三號，油蔴地碼頭至香港大學堂綫，途經必打街，德付道中，轉上花園道，堅道，般含道，第三號甲，油蔴地至摩星嶺綫，經過必打道，德付道中，轉上花園道，堅道，般含道，薄扶林道，摩星嶺道，第四號，油蔴地碼頭至瑪麗醫院綫，經必打街，皇后道中及西，上薄扶林道，而達新建之瑪麗醫院門首，第五號，堅尼地城至大坑綫，經單路乍街，皇后道西，中，及東，由灣仔峽道，轉麽利臣山道，禮頓山道，加路連道而至大坑銅鐫灣道。第六號，油蔴地碼頭至赤柱綫，經必打街，皇后道，及皇后道東，轉上塔士道，淺水灣道，及香島道。第六號A，油蔴地碼頭至淺水觀綫，第七號，油蔴地至香港仔線，經過康樂道中，及西轉入東邊街，過皇后道西，轉上薄扶林道，及香島道，而到終點。第七號A香港仔至赤柱綫，經過香島道淺水灣等地，以上各路綫，巳經把整個香港各區交織啣接着了，只要你有錢，你便可無往而不利。至於你坐要『巴士』，『電車』，『纜車』，『人力車』抑或『的士呢』那只有任從專便了。</p>
<p>再說九龍，那裏的公共交通工具，却不若香港的繁多。沒有電車，也沒有上山的纜車，最主嬰的是『巴士』和『的士』，其次便是人力車。那裏的『的士』，分大小兩種，大的和香港一樣，小的則限坐三人，但他的車費却减為每英里收費三角，這大概是替一人，或三人同坐的乘客的經濟原則着想的。這是值得香港方面『的士』公司當局所效法的。行駛於整個九龍和新界區域的巴士，可分做下列的各種路綫——一號，二號，二號A，三號，三號A，五號，六號七號，八號，九號，十號，十一號，十三號，十五號，十七號，十八號等共十六綫。『巴士』的總站分在尖沙咀，知佐頓道的渡海小輪碼頭，各綫『巴士一』行經的區域，則分為第一號，尖沙咀至深水埗，沿途經過梳利士巴利道，彌敦道，和荔枝角道，而達終點的深水埗，二，號自尖沙咀至荔枝角，經過梳利士巴和道，彌敦道，大捕道，靑山道，而以荔枝角為最終點，二號A，自尖沙咀至欽州街，途經梳利士巴利道，彌敦道，大捕路，而達欽州街，三號，自尖沙咀開，經梳利士巴利道，漆成道，蕪湖街，大沽街，馬頭國道，講公道，太子道，九龍城，西貢道，而到達牛池灣為最終點。三號A，以尖沙咀為起點，經梳和士巴利道，漆咸街，蕪湖街，大沽街，馬頭園道，譯公道，太子道，西貢道，而達終點的九龍城，五號自尖沙咀至佐頓道紀念碑前，途經梳利士巴利道，彌敦道，加拿分道，金巴和道，柯士甸道，居士道，至佐頓道為止，第六號，自尖沙咀至九龍　綫，經梳利十巴利道，彌敦道，太子道，西貢道，而達終點。七號，自尖沙咀至九龍塘綫，經梳利士巴利道，彌敦道，窩打老道。八號，自尖沙咀至九龍塘綫，經梳利士巴利道，彌敦道，亞皆老街，窩打老道。九號，自佐頓這碼頭至元朗綫，經佐頓道，彌教道，大埔道，靑山道，而達新界之元朗墟。十號，自佐頓碼頭至牛池灣線，經佐頓道，上海街，太子道，西貢道，十一號，自九龍城至荔枝角綫，經西貢道，太子道，馬頭圍道，大沽街，湖蕪街，漆成道，加士居道，佐頓道及碼頭，上海街，荔枝角道，欽州街，靑山道，而到終點，十三號，自佐頓碼頭至牛池灣線，經佐頓道，彌教道，太子道，西貢這轉入牛池灣。此外還有十五號的元朗至錦田綫，十七號的元朗至粉峯綫，和十八號的粉嶺至沙頭角綫。但是此三綫巳經在新界範圍，又不在本文討論之到了。</p>
<p>行駛以上各綫的『巴士』，完全由九龍汽車公司承辦，一共擁有大小車輛一百三十餘輛之多。</p>
<p>降上的交通，是經這樣的完善美備了，海面交通，也很令我們滿意，無論你在香港仰或九龍，你走到尖沙咀或統一碼頭，那末，你所需要的目的地，馬上可給你解决，人類的進化是沒有止境的，說不定在不久的將來，香港和九龍也會有空中的交通網呢，（新）</p>

<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>（民革社江會前綫通訊）兩次走到江會的前線、均以不能晉謁到苦戰中的保七團團長揚乾吉為憾、這次再到前綫、等了一個整夜、又等了一個半天、幸而會到我們光榮的揚團長了、</p>
<p>經過了一個多月的苦戰，一個多月的日曝雨打，一個多月的勞神、在記者意想中的楊團長、一定是瘦削而疲倦了、然而，會見之下、事實證明記者的推測是完全錯了、楊團長依舊是那麽胖大的高個子、端正而寬大的臉上煥發着微微的紅光、兩顆大眼珠敏活地溜轉着、」毫無　容、</p>
<p>握過了手後、記者對為民埃為國家而奮戰殺×的楊團長表示無限的敬意、楊團長當卽截斷記者的話頭說、</p>
<p>『那裏、正如古語說、養兵千日、用兵一時』、倘若軍人不打仗、那麽幹麽國家遺虛耗國帑去養兵呢、』</p>
<p>很着、記者恭問此次江會戰事經過、荷承楊團長示圖詳吿、略述如下、</p>
<p>『敝團于三月三十日奉命開拔到江會前綫、四月一日即又奉命反攻江門、、當卽派出第一二營在都會一帶佈防、並與新特務隊取得聯絡、數團祖任右翼，新順務隊担任左翼、二日下午二時許，新順特務隊被×人衝破，我卽又派兩運人去接守、卒因×人集中火力猛攻、退至圭峯山馬山一帶、下午×又以飛機掩護、用唐克車、砲兵、騎兵及步兵聯合部隊向我陣地猛攻、我為避免重大犧牲計、苦戰至四時、乘大爾滂沱中退至大灣蓮塘一帶』、</p>
<p>說到這裏、一位勤務兵到來報吿，叫了楊團長聽電話去、約摸在十分鐘後、楊團長又繼續說、</p>
<p>『三日以後、我軍在平地嶺與大小梅山一帶作戰、十八日我兩營夾攻×人收復都會一帶、十九日晨又開始反攻都會城、第七九連攻入後崗、奪獲×大砲兩門、其他因×大軍從江門反攻、而我援軍又未能及時開到、怱促間、將其兩門頭用手溜彈炸毀、奪獲望遠鏡一架、即安全退回原陣地、是役×死亡尤重、一炮兵隊長陣亡、我第三營營長謝逸凡受傷、同日我另一部從會城北門衝入、、殺×頗多、十九日在會城一帶激戰、我又一度衝入會城、二十至廿三幾天、會城仍在拉鋸狀的激戰中、廿二日第一營營長鐘毓樞又受傷、在作戰廿多天中、團受傷者一百七十八人、死者近百、其中長官佔二三十人、</p>
<p>勤務兵又來報吿、報吿完後、記者問、</p>
<p>『那據××的傷亡類目如何、』</p>
<p>『四百人左右』、揚團長答、</p>
<p>『×我兵力的比較又怎樣，』記者問、</p>
<p>『最初初×人只有二千人左右、後來逐漸增加、巳增至四五千人了、至於我軍、最先參加作戰的有新順特務隊和敝團。但新順的人數很少、在岡州路上一役被×人衝散後、以後就很少在前綫出現了、陸續到來增援的有保三團及保十團、另有大軍數團、亦到達前綫某地』、楊灘長答、</p>
<p>『楊團長你看×人侵佔江會的野心怎樣　？』記者問、</p>
<p>『照我個人看×人唯一的野心就是想奪取單水口、進攻西江、以威脅廣西、但西江我軍守備甚嚴、且沿河有極多的水雷，×人决難越過』、</p>
<p>說到這裏、楊團長遞一支香煙給記者，燒起烟時、房間一陣沉默、一會兒、記者詢及此次反攻會城未能整個完成之原因，楊團長答、</p>
<p>『友軍聯絡的不好是一個主要的原因、』</p>
<p>跟着談到軍民合作問題、楊團長說</p>
<p>『新　的民運運工作做得很不够、在這一帶作戰、不但得不到民衆的帮助、一且處為予我軍以困難、還有、這裏的漢奸也特別多呢、』</p>
<p>勤務兵又進來、交一張紙條給楊團長、等楊團長寫了一張紙條後、記者又問、</p>
<p>『從這次作戰來看、我軍與×軍的士氣怎樣？」</p>
<p>楊團長的囘答是：</p>
<p>『我官兵作戰英勇、視死如歸、×　則臨陣愴惶、極為怕死、這有很多事實可以証明、第一，在作戰上、我軍二衝鋒、×軍卽退縮、還有第二個更實在的例、有一次、兩個第八連的弟兄伏在七子坑地方和他們對戰、支持至三四個鐘頭後、將×人打退、並安全歸來、那時我在山頂上用望遠鏡見得很淸楚、後來每人嘉獎三塊大洋，』停了一會、記者問、</p>
<p>『這次作戰的接濟怎樣』、</p>
<p>楊團長略作沉吟後、答、</p>
<p>『糧食的接濟不大成問題、但目前我們仍有兩個最大的困難、第一、我們缺乏醫藥、以致士兵傷了沒有藥敷，增加不少的苦痛、第二，我們有錢買不到膠鞋、沒有膠鞋不好走路、這對于作戰是大有影響的、我們目前巳急切需解决這個問題』、</p>
<p>說完後、楊團長摸摸皮帶上的手槍、並鬆了　皮帶、微笑着對記者發問、</p>
<p>『林先生什麽時候回香港去呢？』</p>
<p>『打算就在最近三數天囘去了、有什麽見敎呢？』記者答、</p>
<p>『沒有什麽、不過希望你囘去後，一代我向香港僑胞呼籲、我們正在急亟需要藥品和膠鞋接濟、』</p>
<p>『當然、這是我的資任啦！』</p>
<p>說到這裏，記者要求楊團長題字紀念、楊團長說。</p>
<p>『我的書法不好、還是贈幅相片你吧、』</p>
<p>楊團長在贈給記老的相片的底面上題着下面兩句，</p>
<p>『我死則國生、我生則國亡、』</p>
<p>把江會戰爭中的楊團長和這題字對照起來，這正　現楊團是一位抗戰的英雄、廿八、五、三、於江會前線某地</p>

<p>凱萊夫婦被新聞記者包圍了！和他説幾句眞不容易、我們問他游日的一般印象、而他說話很僅謹、隨處避事　輕、仔細着我們的臉、說道、『這裏有日本記者沒有、』答「沒有、」　放心說、我倆到東京，首次和日本報界見面、他們第一句就問我好萊塢影星拒　日本絲襪有這事麽、我只好說這還不很淸楚、我曾參觀各影片公司，覺得設備很不錯、古裝片的服裝很美、不過時裝片太差了，我不以為然、其他不願多說、</p>
<p>憑　戰跡</p>
<p>凱萊早就决定憑弔上海戰跡、可見非常關心中日之勝、昨天費了三小時光陰，遙望閘北江灣市中心一帶焦土抗戰的遺跡、他不發表什麽感想、不過詞氣之間、很有悲憫慨歉兼有同情的樣子，尤其是經過某僑境、眼看無數難民被侵略者搜查時一副猙獰的面目、很覺悽慘、正想攝入鏡頭、而被嚴厲制止、深為遺憾、</p>
<p>愛好國劇</p>
<p>他因為時間很經濟、我們不便多發言、只隨便問了三點、（一）先生過去所導演的影片、以何者最滿意，（二）這次返美、將有何新片攝製、（三）對中國電影與戲劇的觀感、……他答語頗簡單、（一）那到不論影片的性質、但視劇本的好壞而定、像『乞丐皇帝』我自己比較滿意些、因為那主角兩兄弟都很好、（二）返美後導演什麽片、此時未能預定、（三）我對梅關芳的戲劇很有興趣，記得在美時曾看過他的戲、感覺所配的音樂服裝與表情都可好、可惜不甚明瞭此行匆匆、未能參觀中國的攝影場、引為憾事、他又說以前曾識中國字四十餘、現在只記得「人」字和「田」字了、相與一笑、談至此大家握手吿別、</p>

<p>弗萊第白塞洛　　弗萊第演片不在少數、特足為影迷牢記者、卽『忠義雙全』一片、除發掘泰羅飽華外、同時亦為此童星之成名作也、弗萊第之最佳作、無疑為『塊肉餘生』、</p>

<p>電話就是那美麗的卡伐來姐小打的，只是他不知道，她的確是個極有名的歌唱家，果眞他需要一個專家說出對於她夫人的歌唱的意見，她是很願意給他的，音樂會她曾去聽過，問他是否眞需要。</p>

<h3 id="c53">公開棒球戰　中華隊出師不利　陳倫英鑄成大錯四比六敗績　岷甸奴實力與中華相等惟各員擊球甚準 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】太陽可愛亦可怕，若遇着它氣燄迫人的時候、便會令到無論任誰都覺得不舒適，卽像咋天它露出火般的面孔、光顧到每個人的身上、炙着肌膚作痛，但有閒階級尙不以意、祇苦了一般日謀升斗的勞苦大衆、</p>
<p>然而、一般的　育健兒、倒不怕熱、咋天那可令人注意的球類競賽中、有棒球、有足球、一個個在火傘似的友陽之下活躍着、要怎樣設計和努力來爭取勝他們的勝利、一般迷民、也有許多祇以肌膚抵抗起太陽的熱力、立着或坐着那無遮蓋的地方參觀、仍不以爲苦、</p>
<p>那幕棒球是在上午十時開仗、由去屆冠軍中華對打岷甸奴的美水兵、這兩枝人馬，都相當强勁，一旦遭遇爭雄長、定有劇鬥、所以此中「道友」、都欲一覘究竟、看誰手段高强、那容量不大的觀台、高朋滿座、倒算熱鬧、</p>
<p>中華陣裏、多歡是去届冠軍人物、祗少了陳達耀、羅威廉兩位名將、換上幾個新人、依此看來、實力還是充厚、多數看客、也以爲不會輸給岷隊的、怎料競爭結果、竟以四比六吃敗仗、首次出師、便遭不利、難道去屆冠軍的聲威、就此消失嗎、</p>
<p>華中致敗的最大癥結、是在第二局爲防守組時、陳倫英弄出一次大錯、遂使大有可爲的局面、由此陷於歷刼不復之地位、而各員的擊球術、也似不比美水兵準確、不過、此役中華得安打七記且有一次三壘打及兩次二壘打、岷隊只得安打六記，一記一壘打，以此比較、所謂擊球衛比岷隊略差又不盡然、總之、此回敗績、其咎的在倫英身上、</p>
<p>投手黃榮俊、爲全場表演最佳的員、在防守時候、他能控制得宜、所投出的球、每令對方擊手空擊不中，乃有九次三球數的傑作、雖然四球數也不免有的、也不過二次而已、獨可惜這二次四球數、却於第二局正在多難的時候弄出、復因倫英大錯、致此局連失三分、敗北亦基於是、命該如此、却怨誰來、</p>
<p>榮俊防守的優點、已如上述、至其攻擊時候、僅爲擊手三次、而三次均得安打、三壘打、二壘打、一壘打各一記、如此戰功、誠難能可貴、</p>
<p>捕手林業、最肯用腦、每有動作、均露出他的智能、愉壘亦矯捷、故咋戰雖敗續、全不關于投手及捕手方面、其實此二人的有功而無過也、</p>
<p>倫英担任一壘、在全場防守中、除第局那次大錯、此外尙無過失，惟他跑步甚慢、幾次爲擊手時擊出的球、那跑不到一壘便被黜、若矯捷一點、斷不致三次都望壘興　、準有一次或可到達安全地點的、</p>
<p>二壘胡正渠擊球尙欠鎭定、防守則頗有功、三壘嘉拉利、他是加拿大歸國華僑、所以用這個名字、論其技術、非十分精巧、不過、祇一次　出、未可作爲定論、且看下週演出又如何、</p>
<p>游擊陳芳、擊　術頗有把握、惟對於防守、未見進步、雖有臂力、擲球能致遠、然因目標欠準、致弄出一次挪囘一壘逸球的錯誤、</p>
<p>左翼鍾　森、是　宿將、富有經驗、場內捉球本不錯、怎曉得昨戰在第六局中、有一次被球兒騙了他、走錯方向、不特捉不着球兒、反給　愛路因此記一安打、眞出人意料、中堅蔡炳芬在同此局中、也先來一次大同小異的事情、可謂湊巧之至、至於兩人的擊球術、老蔡好些、常藉其豐富的經驗、得上一壘、</p>
<p>右翼鄭李門二捉球曾有一次漏手、擊球則頗佳、沒有空擊之弊、</p>
<p>依我所見、中華各員的擊球術、可無間言、惟對防守還須下苦功、若其維繫得法、减少錯漏、便相信他日無論對任何一隊、都有戰勝可能、</p>
<p>岷隊投手魯愛路的功夫、實在榮俊之下、惟全隊防守嚴密、就中以二壘渣氏最好、一壘德忌士利因身高手長、捉出很少漏空、</p>
<p>比賽過程、第一局中華元爲防守組、無所失、輪到中華爲攻擊組、陳芳得一分、第二局首　榮俊捉球失手、一壘被佔、跟着榮俊投來二記四球數、以致一壘俱有敵人在、再不幸他利一擊、倫英弄出大錯、遂被佔壘三人跑歸、連失三分、輪到中華則無所獲、第三局一比塔岷隊又增多一分、第四局中華賴榮俊三壘安打而歸位、還以一點顏色、第五局俱空手下場、第六岷隊通得三記安打、又得兩分、而中華復賴榮俊一壘安打而送林業歸位、第七局一比零中華再奪囘一分、總比數四比六、中華敗陣、成續如下、</p>

<p>（本報專訊）全港公開革地網球單打决賽、今天下于四時三刻、在香港木球會塲舉行、對壘者爲徐糯培與徐潤培、兩人乃係昆仲、此番遭遇爭標、球迷們多料他倆决無鬩牆之鬥、或存禮讓之風，然識　者、則謂他倆必不以一玩「風流球」便了事、因爲哥哥巳久飲盛譽、惟小弟弟迄今猶未得過甜頭、對單打冠軍一席、故不無覬覦之心、但雄心與能力、是不能相提並論的、今天小弟弟的雄心、能否達到成功的途徑、還要一看他倆的爭鬥，到底如何收場</p>
<p>猶憶去年硬地網球賽、他倆也和今次一樣同得决賽權、故到了舉行爭標戰的時候、許多人以爲哥哥會手下留情、給予小弟弟一登寶座、可是决賽結果、哥哥以藝高一籌、卒得錦標、並無情面用事、</p>
<p>今次又共同進至爭標的地位、故雖是手足、預科必有激爭、但小弟弟的功夫、還有多少未及哥哥之處、依此推測、哥哥　面居多、然而二人球藝、均臻妙境、則角逐之下、定多精彩動作、以飫球迷們眼紹、（東郎）</p>

<p>……【本報專訊】本屆男子籃球賽、刻已轉入密鑼緊鼓聲中、今晚秩序、計有甲組兩場、乙組一塲、六時半乙組鐘聲戰華雄、七時半甲組星島逢南華、八時半東方抗鐘聲、</p>
<p>……星島自擊敗東方後、對冠軍賣座，大有染指之勢、就以目前情勢而論、其能與星島抗衡者、厥爲南華、故今夕兩軍相逢、不啻爭標决賽、如星島能擊敗南華、則冠軍一席、穩爲所得、如不然者、便夜長夢多、錦標誰屬、仍有待於異日而後定、故是場戰學、關係至事、</p>
<p>……以雙方實力而論、星島旗下建將衆多，且俱爲去屆冠軍靑年會隊之得力份子、又得地利之宜、聯絡純熟、雖勁如東方、去週亦被其所敗，至南華之虞鬥力、亦極充沛、素來作戰、尤側重聯絡、乃一戰略美妙之隊伍、比諸星島，無分軒、惟籃底一擊、則不及星島之兇、今夕兩雄相遇、又因勝負關係重大、彼此勢必力爭、故鹿死誰手、正未可斜</p>
<p>……尾場東方戰鐘聲、雙方亦工力悉敵、而勝負問題之重要性、尤不亞於次場、蓋得勝者、則對於亞軍一席、大有希望、因是之故、此役亦必劇烈、</p>
<p>……顧東方雖曾一度見敗于星島、但實力固强、人所共知、不過鐘聲亦屬雄師，前勝星島、尤爲其最得意傑作、今夕與東方週旋、各欲圖取勝利、其競爭之烈、乃意中事、勝利誰屬亦難預斷也、</p>
<p>……乙組之戰、兩軍實力相埒，亦有看頭、惟華雄射籃較確、取勝較有把握</p>
<p>……籃球聯會以今夕四强會師、觀客定必擠擁、爲維持秩序起見、門券一律增加、計樓下座位一元、限銷二百張、摟上五角限售四百張、除該晚與譽六隊及名譽證可享免費參觀外，其餘各隊員憑球員證可得購半券入塲、（計樓上二角、樓下五角、）四强出戰人馬如下、</p>

<p>本屆足球聯賽亞軍東方隊、與　門聯隊相對抗之戰事、咋日下午四時半、經如期在香港會場演出、澳軍雖挾戰勝岷尼拉埠際隊、及星洲中華隊之雄戚而來、欲一舉而下東方、但究竟亞軍之實實力不凡、確有看家本領、上半時即先聲奪人、以一比〇佔先、下半時一比一完場、總結果卒以二比一獲勝、</p>
<p>是日天晴氣暖、綠草如茵、並由陳蘭芳行開球禮、以示隆重、球迷以好事當前、皆不肯輕輕放過、仕女蒞臨、恍如歸市、賣票成績、頗不弱也、</p>
<p>昨澳隊之華繙球員何佐勝、原定隨軍來港、惟因上星期三日下午代表　克胡對英海軍作友誼賽、致左腿受傷、故未克來港參戰、澳隊　以陣容缺整、迫得與東方議、情商江善敬仍爲澳隊効力、而原定出助東方之鄒文治、適患河魚之疾、未克臨場、李德祺則以足傷新痊、雖上陣而走動仍感不便、遂調用鄭英權充任左前衛、聘黃文貴爲左翼、</p>
<p>在戰時檢討兩方實力、則東方確較高一着、而　　漢、曾仲雲、羅偉權之演出、均極平穩、前衛綫亦佳、前鋒綫雖時有展、惟聯絡極爲渙散、尤以於洽興一人爲最甚、</p>
<p>澳隊方面、除以申都士瓜代亞麥朋、曁善敬替代佐勝外、其餘各戰將、均按　定登場、守門嘉華路、演出平常、內衛羅巴度勝善敬、前衛綫以亞羅殊最佳、爲全隊特色人物、惟左右二人甚弱、匪持與前鋒漫無合作、且常作無的之傅球、前鋒綫中兩翼頗活潑、正前鋒基里路、亦至兇悍、舉動靈敏、惟諸將皆射門乏術、聯絡又不如人、逐遭收　、</p>
<p>戰時情形、甚少情彩、亦不緊張最初澳隊快　硬幹、來勞頗兇、惟　鋒　應不靈、常失機會、及後東方看出對方破綻、進攻甚力、乃由祺祥打進一球終半場、</p>
<p>下半時戰况亦平淡、互有往還、徒見奔跑、混戰上餘分鐘、乃由洽興在門前發矢、多勝一球、得打開悶局、澳隊一失再失、反攻甚力、卒由中鋒頂入一球、以一比二終場、東方勝客軍、兩隊如下、</p>

<h3 id="c61">論青年自新運動 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 文俞</p>
<p>全港學生界于「五七』舉行這偉大靑年節的慶祝，並展開靑年自新運動，這是劃　代的大事件，是全港靑年的戰鬥的歌聲！</p>
<p>或者說、靑年的『自新』，是否靑年有了罪過，須去「悔罪』的意義呢？不！靑年，年輕而天眞的純潔的一代，他自身是淸白的，光明的，他有活力，有熱情，有理想，自然也有缺點，不是神，誰也有缺點，但沒有什麽罪過，所謂「自新，就是除舊史新，自新運動，就是除舊更新的自覺運動，所以我們應首先　定，全港青年自新運動，並不是跟着政治的尾巴的短時而非持續的動作；靑年自新這動應該作爲全港文化運動，響應祖國的新啓蒙運動，並作爲新啟蒙運動的交流。</p>
<p>靑年自新運動，顧名思義，是各層階的靑年分子的自新運動，不單祗包含靑年學生，而且包括其外的更廣大的靑年羣。但我們不能否認它是靑年學生所提出，所領導，自己作爲運動的主流。</p>
<p>靑年自新運動，我們從它的綱領看來，其內容當然要革除陋習，克服落後，力求進步，這種進步性的動作，得要有靑年的自覺，靑年頭腦的武裝，靑年思想的啓發，在開明的進步的當中—才能獲得完成。</p>
<p>所以，全港靑年，在這抗戰建國的過程中，欲要獲得應有的新生，發揚自己的力量以推進抗戰建國的巨輪，並準備充當目由的新中國的眞正主人翁的詁，把靑年自新運動作爲思想淸濾思想啓發的契機，是當前的要務！</p>
<p>歷史家指出歐洲文藝復典時代的兩大特徵是：『人的發見』，「世界的發見」，現在我們要求：認識世界，認識自己。</p>
<p>靑年自新運動的展開，是青年自覺性的增長的表現，是時代的新賦予，是必然的而非偶然的，應該是發展的有前途的而不是花一現的，祖國在抗戰中，每個靑年那注視關心着祖國抗戰，而在抗戰的光焰下受敎育，覺醒！</p>
<p>關懷祖國的抗戰，便要認識祖國，認識祖國的現在，便要了解祖國的過去，從對祖國的過去與現在的認識，看淸組國的未來，這是靑年應有的意識的武裝，然而，中國是世界的中國，世界存在着兩大陣線的鬥爭，存在着兩大人羣的矛盾，祖國的抗戰也是其中之一環，世界有着光明勢力在生長，也有着惡魔在逞兇，而這些的一切正與祖國起着交互影響的作用，因此，要認識祖過，便要認識世界，把中國看作世界的一環，時代正在激動飛躍，一秒鐘的進程比以前快數十百倍，我們應該認識世界，以理智把握時代，才能趕得上時代，才不曾落伍，才能向前進，作爲時代的先鋒！</p>
<p>能認識世界，便能認識自己；能認識自己，更能認識世界，和把自我力量提昇和發揚，靑年，半殖民地中國的靑年，在自由解放鬥爭中的中國的靑年，要認識自己，香港的靑年，除了一部份進步的以外，靑年目新運動要靑年更新，脫　一切迷信，　蒙，獨斷，盲從的泥坑，囘復純眞的自我，認識自我，看淸自我在當前的歷史的任務！</p>
<p>靑年自新運動應該是持續的文化運動，不能是短時的表面的裝飾門面的運動</p>
<p>靑年目新運動應該使靑年認識自己，認識世界，有了意識上的改革和武裝，才能除舊更新；經過思想清慮思想啓發，才能發揚理性，打倒一切迷信，愚蒙，獨斷，盲從—是這樣的靑年自新運動才能使靑年活力得以發揚，充當得起新中國的主人翁！</p>
<p>望靑年自新運動的頷導者展開廣汎的工作，並配合着文化界一同努力！</p>

<p>在不健全的社會制度下，所產生的畸形現象，必然的是有其客觀的因素，換句話說，一個人的爲非作歹，幷不是有先天性的，一切罪惡的長成，都是基于現實社會裏的畸形誘力，在良莠不齊的都市裏，二一般沒有控制自己的理智力量的人們，往往會惑於某種事物，而以某毬事物爲實現自己慾望或寄托情緒的對象，以致於產生不可　藥的惡果，這是無可諱言的一般實情。</p>
<p>上海都市，本來是一罪惡的淵藪，利用詭詐，欺　的方式而進取物質，所在皆是，遷來滬西賭窟之多，及其給予一般意志不堅定的人們底影響，更其加深了上海製造罪惡的速度，眞使人小寒而慓。</p>
<p>近幾個月以來，展開報紙的社會新聞版，那因淮出睹窟而發生業務上的舞弊，侵佔，盜竊等　果的記戰，　無日無之，尤以薪給階級爲甚。</p>
<p>這些薪給階級出入於睹窟，除了一部份不自量力的好賭之徒外，我想他們必存了一個僥倖心。在物價騰貴的現在，薪給階級的生活方式自然是相當淸苦，欲期望增厚物質的享受，也等於『畫餅充饑』：於是乎就別闢蹊徑，希冀以橫財的獲得，去充實自己的生活，而進出於賭窟；不幸的悲慘後果，在他們的腦筋中，簡直由淡漠而幻滅得無影無踪了。</p>
<p>但是，走進睹窟之後，任何力量都不能過止罪惡的滋長與蔓延，任何方式都不避免產生惡果；也們挾其少許新給所得走進去，非但絕無僥倖獲得贏資的希望，並且還不够注　，一輸即光。於是，輪負之後想罰本，翻本的資金又必輸負，一而再，再而三，愈陷愈多，其所得賴以生活的金錢，都　　以盡，而其生活又不能停止不食不衣，處在這樣的變重壓力之下，歪曲的思想與行動就必然的因而產生。不久以前報戰，有：銀行職員舞弊被發覺，店員侵佔被發覺，某賬房虧欠若干，以及妻女首飾衣物被典　殆　，吵鬧不休的，眞是不一而足。而最近又見報載某綢莊夥偷竊拷綢若干疋，被判一年六月徒刑。這些現象的根苗，同樣的都是因爲報效賭窟，甚至有專以這種金錢去作賭本：結果飽嘗鐵窗風味，貽累妻兒，貽害社會，賭窟的力量眞是可怖！</p>
<p>這還是眼見的事實，其他未經報章宣佈的，更不知凡幾，其數量較徒刑幾年幾月的更要多上若干倍吧？這種社會的惡果，一方而面然是由於社會的畸形，一方面也因一般人缺乏定力，不能主宰自已，明知其必無好果，還要甘　不韙去嘗試，何况這種賭窟還是培植於敵人勢力之下的哩！爲今之計，能根本剷除這毬殺人不用刀的賭裔固好；其次也要希望一般人猛雀，勿多事迷戀，同時，希望僱主方面對於　貧的生活，行動也要加以充分的注意，　可事前預防，不要事後力謀補救，纔是兩得其益的辦法。若因進出賭裔而致舞弊，侵佔，盜竊等，喧騰於社會，本人的人格，名譽，固然是破產了，而僱主的方面也不免有管理不精密，內部組織不健全的缺點暴露。</p>

<p>— Feng Kai</p>
<p>Foreword - Achieving True Victory in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>China's war of resistance is a just war against aggression, a war of self-defense and liberation. Its purpose is to resist Japan's attempts to control and enslave the Chinese people, to protect the Chinese nation and state from Japanese aggression, and to strive for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation and people. China's war of resistance is being carried out with the support of the entire nation. Such a war - a just, anti-aggression, self-defense, and liberation war - will inevitably gain the support of the entire nation, and the entire nation will inevitably and should support such a war. Therefore, the question is how do we wage this war to achieve true victory in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>"War is a continuation of politics." This famous historical saying should be the starting point for deciding how we will conduct this War of Resistance and how we can achieve true victory in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Ilyich once said:</p>
<p>"War is a continuation of politics. One should study the pre-war policies, the policies that caused the war and the policies that have already caused the war. If the policy is one of protecting the interests of financial capital, a policy of plundering and oppressing various places and other countries, then the war arising from such a policy is also a war. If, however, the policy is one of national liberation, that is, a policy expressing the liberation movement against national oppression, then the war arising from such a policy is a war of national liberation."</p>
<p>A nation that has been invaded, starting from its policy of national liberation, the resulting war of national liberation, it must adopt a policy of national liberation in order to achieve the true victory of the war of liberation. The policy of conducting a war of national liberation, generally speaking, is the total mobilization of the entire nation, and the total mobilization of the entire nation includes the mobilization of the entire nation's military, political, public, financial, economic, educational, and diplomatic aspects. Spiritual mobilization is also a part of this total national mobilization and is based on the total national mobilization.</p>
<p>The policies that should be adopted for waging war and the policies that should be adopted to ensure victory in war must be inseparable from the policies implemented by a certain country or group before the war. A country that has been invaded, a people that has been invaded, adopting a policy of opposing aggression in the long before the war, adopting a policy of seeking its own national liberation, in order to ensure the victory of this war when the war has already occurred and is underway, it must adopt a policy that is adapted to anti-aggression and seeking its own national liberation. Ilyich once said:</p>
<p>"War is the continuation of policy by other means. Any war is inseparably linked to the kind of political system that produces the war. A certain country, a certain class within that country, the kind of policy that it has been pursuing for a long time during the war inevitably and unavoidably this class will continue that policy during the war. Only the form of activity is changed." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 3)</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation, our Chinese people, the policy adopted in the long-term movement against aggression and seeking national liberation is the policy of national liberation. Now, as the national liberation war against aggression is already underway, we must implement a true policy of national liberation in order to guarantee the true victory of this war.</p>
<p>The "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline" recently promulgated by the Supreme National Defense Council has aroused concern and attention from all parties. This is an inevitable result, because the people of the whole country are paying attention to and concerned about the fate of their nation and the victory or defeat of China's War of Resistance at all times, because the people of the whole country are always expecting to implement a true political system of national liberation that can guarantee the victory of the War of Resistance. Our government is a government leading the War of Resistance, and none of its measures and decrees is without a direct and indirect impact on the fate of the people and the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the people of the whole country not only express concern and attention to the "National Spiritual Mobilization," but also hope that the government can take progressive and active measures and decrees to ensure the true victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, we would like to explain the policy of national liberation that guarantees victory in the War of Resistance - the total mobilization of the entire nation, to explain the relationship between "spiritual mobilization" and total national mobilization, and to explain the content and significance of "spiritual mobilization," which is particularly necessary.</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship Between Total National Mobilization and "Spiritual Mobilization"</p>
<p>China's War of Resistance is a war of national liberation waged by an invaded nation, that is, a revolutionary war. The key to victory in the war of national liberation and the revolutionary war lies in:</p>
<p>"... revolutionary war, when it truly attracts and moves the oppressed laboring masses, when it makes the oppressed laboring masses realize that they are against the exploiters, this revolutionary war will arouse supernatural perseverance and ability." (Ilyich)</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Chinese anti-Japanese national liberation war, in order to defeat Japanese , it is necessary to have this condition, it is necessary to have this condition. This condition is the most reliable guarantee for the true victory of the War of Resistance. To enable this condition to be realized is the total mobilization of the entire nation.</p>
<p>As early as two years before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese proposed the call for "total mobilization of the entire nation" in the "August 1st Declaration," and under this call for total mobilization, specifically put forward the slogans "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength," "those who have guns contribute guns," "those who have knowledge contribute knowledge," etc., which are becoming the guiding principles for mobilizing the people to participate in the War of Resistance today.</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance broke out, the Chinese again proposed in the declaration against the Japanese invasion of North China: "Implement the total mobilization of the Chinese people." Shortly after the outbreak of the War of Resistance (August 1937), it was proposed in the "Outline for Striving for Victory in the War of Resistance": "Total military mobilization" and "Total mobilization of the entire nation." After the fall of Nanjing, in a declaration on the current situation, it was again proposed: "Mobilize the military, manpower, intelligence, financial resources, and material resources of the entire China to continue the long-term war of defending the territory."</p>
<p>The Chinese has always believed that the guarantee of victory in China's War of Resistance must be the total mobilization of the entire nation. Spiritual mobilization, or political mobilization, is a part of the total national mobilization. It must be coordinated with the total national mobilization, then spiritual mobilization can play its due role in the War of Resistance, as stated in the "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline":</p>
<p>Now war is a war of total national mobilization, so not only should all the materials and manpower in the country be mobilized, but also the spirit of the people of the whole country must be mobilized. To mobilize the spirit of the people of the whole country to enrich the national strength of the War of Resistance, it is not in the mobilization, but especially in the organization. Organized spirit, combined with organized manpower, utilizing organized material resources, is sufficient to meet the current needs of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, spiritual mobilization must be based on the total mobilization of the people, the mobilization of materials, and the mobilization of manpower. Therefore, spiritual mobilization must aim at exerting the power of organization.</p>
<p>Helping the Total Mobilization of the People</p>
<p>Spiritual mobilization occupies a very important role in the War of Resistance, and it is of great significance for adhering to the protracted war, adhering to the united front, and striving for final victory. Therefore, the Chinese, in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session, stated that the first urgent task of the entire Chinese nation is: "Highly promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, resolutely resist the war to the end, and overcome pessimism and despair - only for surrender and compromise." Before the War of Resistance, the Chinese estimated the important role of national spirit in launching the sacred anti-Japanese war, and has always opposed national defeatism and national pessimism, and opposed the "fear of Japan disease" that loses national self-confidence and self-esteem. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has repeatedly pointed out the need to improve the national spirit, improve national self-esteem and self-confidence, stimulate every Chinese person's hatred for the nation, advocate the spirit of sacrifice for the country and the nation, advocate the spirit of sincere unity, advocate the spirit of democratic cooperation, the revolutionary spirit of serving the nation loyally, and the spirit of striving for the thorough realization of the Three People's Principles for the founding of the country through the War of Resistance and for the final victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In the current stage of the War of Resistance, because of the betrayal of the traitors, the open surrender to Japan, planning to bomb Chinese cities for Japan, planning to attack China, and acting as Japan's running dogs. Because some frustrated politicians, officials, warlords openly acted as Japan's puppets, betrayed the Chinese nation, lost national integrity, and corrupted national morals: because some compromisers and surrenderers lost confidence in the War of Resistance, and openly or secretly undermined China's war effort and undermined the cause of unity and unification, they wanted to sacrifice the interests of the nation to surrender to Japan. Due to all these circumstances, it is really very necessary to intensify spiritual mobilization at present, to crush all the actions of traitors, puppets, etc., and to expose all ideas of compromise and peace through spiritual mobilization.</p>
<p>In the current War of Resistance, due to the intensification of the political disintegration plot by people, and because people's "quick war and quick decision" strategy has been broken, and the "quick peace and quick knot" conspiracy has repeatedly failed, people will inevitably take more political conspiracies to provoke the unity of our nation, disintegrate the unity of our nation, and shake our determination and confidence in victory in the War of Resistance, in order to achieve the poisonous plan of subjugating our nation and destroying our nation. As the outline clearly states: "Today, the people know that military strength is not enough to subjugate us and achieve their purpose of quick decision, so their recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit in various ways."</p>
<p>There is no doubt that people are using various political conspiracies to undermine our country's War of Resistance, and there is no need to prove it.</p>
<p>The question that arises here is whether there are fundamental principles and methods of difference in the total national mobilization of the invading country and the invaded country? Yes, and there certainly will be, because there is a difference in the fundamental principles and the fundamental nature between the war of aggression and the war against aggression.</p>
<p>Because the war waged by aggressors is unjust and aggressive. Its purpose is for the benefit of financial capital. Its purpose is to invade and enslave other countries and other nations. At the same time, it is also to deepen and prolong the enslavement and oppression of the people within its own country. Therefore, such a war is bound to be resisted by the people at home and will not receive the sympathy of the people at home. In order to oppress and coerce the people at home to wage a war for the benefit of financial capital, aggressors must implement an extremely anti- policy at home to carry out total national mobilization.</p>
<p>From the "Japanese National General Mobilization Law" and "Spiritual Mobilization" implemented by the Japanese in the war of aggression against China, it can be fully seen that the implementation of the Japanese General Mobilization Law is to squeeze the last drop of blood and sweat from Japanese workers and peasants and the laboring masses. Under the "gathering of national defense workers," military labor service is implemented on Japanese workers. Under the "National Mobilization Law," farmers' horses, rice, wheat, forage, etc. are plundered, large numbers of people are drafted, taxes are forcibly increased, paper money is issued indiscriminately, and public bonds are forcibly apportioned. Under the "Spiritual Mobilization," a large number of Japanese professors, students, freelancers, and cultural figures are arrested, and a large-scale massacre and suppression of Japanese anti-war groups and anti-war figures is carried out, and a large number of social science books and all books containing opposition to war are searched and burned, and all speech organs that sympathize with China and are dissatisfied with the war are closed down. "Japan's National Mobilization Law" and "Spiritual Mobilization" are carried out under the whip, bayonet, massacre, prison, arrest, and closure. The mobilization of Japanese fascist aggressors has not only aroused strong resistance from Japanese workers, farmers, laborers, and freelancers, but has also aroused resistance from small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and part of the liberal bourgeoisie. The whips, bayonets, massacres, prisons, arrests, and closures of Japanese fascist aggressors cannot make Japan's total national mobilization go smoothly, cannot prevent the increase of the Japanese people's anti-war movement, and cannot prevent the Japanese people's movement against the "Mobilization Law." The reason why Japanese fascist warlords want to adopt this method to implement total national mobilization is determined by the nature of its war of aggression.</p>
<p>China's War of Resistance is a just, anti-aggression, national liberation war. Its purpose is for the benefit of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people. Its purpose is to protect its own nation and its own people. Its purpose is to resist the aggression of Japanese fascism and resist the enslavement of the Chinese people by Japanese fascism. Therefore, this kind of war will inevitably gain the unanimous support of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization that we want to implement must be in line with the policy of national liberation.</p>
<p>We want to implement total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization on the basis of the unanimous support and participation of the people of the whole country in the War of Resistance, so as to further promote and help the people exert more strength to contribute to the country and the nation, in order to obtain the victory of the entire War of Resistance. The interests of the War of Resistance are in line with the interests of the entire nation and the people, and the interests of the War of Resistance are the highest interests of the entire nation and the people at present. Therefore, the total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization carried out in our China are absolutely not and will not be carried out under the whip, bayonet, massacre, prison, arrest, and closure like Japan, but are completely opposite to the methods carried out by Japan. The method of carrying out total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization in our country is that under the leadership of the government and with the help of the government, the people of the whole country voluntarily participate, and actively participate, just as the "Mobilization Implementation" method in the outline says: "The implementation of spiritual mobilization is mostly conducive to the self-consciousness of the conscience of every citizen. Mutual encouragement and inspiration are the means to help their self-consciousness. As for the determination of laws and disciplines, it should only be used to assist the deficiencies of enlightenment and encouragement, so the main work is to focus on the suitability of advocacy and propaganda education." This principle based on self-consciousness and voluntariness, enlightenment and encouragement, advocacy and propaganda is the basic principle and method for our country to carry out total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization. This principle and method of mobilization is only possible in a just war, and a just war must adopt this principle and method of mobilization.</p>
<p>From this point of view, because the nature of the war is completely different, the total national mobilization, including spiritual mobilization, in principle and method are fundamentally different. Ignoring this difference is equivalent to ignoring that China's War of Resistance is a war of liberation and a war of revolution, and is equivalent to ignoring the difference between a just war and an unjust war.</p>
<p>Some people suggest that the spiritual total mobilization we are carrying out should refer to the spiritual total mobilization carried out by people. These achievements are due to sticking to the preconceived notion of imitating others in everything, or due to not understanding that the anti-Japanese war carried out in China has a fundamental difference from Japan's war of aggression, but in any case, the total national mobilization we are carrying out does not need to refer to the total national mobilization carried out by Japanese fascists under the whip, bayonet, massacre, prison arrest, and closure, which is beyond doubt. We will carry out total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization in accordance with the policy of national liberation, which will certainly achieve smooth progress, achieve certain results, and achieve the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>2. The Significance and Content of Spiritual Mobilization</p>
<p>After explaining the importance of spiritual mobilization in the current War of Resistance, after explaining the relationship between total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization, after explaining the role of total national mobilization in guaranteeing victory in the War of Resistance, after explaining the fundamental differences in principles and methods between total national mobilization and spiritual mobilization due to the different nature of the war, it can be seen that the significance of spiritual mobilization lies in concentrating the various different wills and thoughts of the people of the whole country on a common goal - the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, which lies in uniting all levels of classes, all parties, all occupations, all nationalities, etc., and complementing different ideas to oppose a common enemy - Japanese . The introduction to the outline points out:</p>
<p>"The so-called national spiritual mobilization, from its literal meaning, is to concentrate all personal consciousness, thinking, wisdom, and spiritual power on one direction and improve its use, and for the entire nation, it is to concentrate the spiritual power of the people of different ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives on a common goal and jointly encourage them to increase it, organize and regulate it to exert it, and determine the center of organization to enhance the efficiency of its exertion."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the significance of spiritual mobilization lies in uniting together, regardless of party affiliation, class, occupation, belief, age, gender, nationality, etc., and concentrating the various different thoughts of these different groups of people on one direction - opposing Japanese , on a common goal - the War of Resistance and national construction, "and improving its use," "and jointly encouraging it to increase it."</p>
<p>Now let's explain the content of spiritual mobilization in the War of Resistance. The "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline" announced by the Supreme National Defense Council has a general description. This outline lists "common goals," "morality of saving the country," "faith of building the country," "spiritual reform," "mobilization leadership," "mobilization implementation," and other items. Among the common goals are: "(1) National supremacy and national supremacy. (2) Military first and victory first. (3) Concentration of will and concentration of strength."</p>
<p>In an unprecedented sacred war of national liberation, in an invaded country, in a semi-colonial China, national thought and national concept have revolutionary significance for national independence and liberation, especially in our country, some people are confined to personal interests, and even have no concept of national state at all. They often go to the road of being traitors and sellouts for the people. Therefore, it is very necessary to highly promote the national spirit and highly promote the patriotic spirit. Only this is the true meaning of "national supremacy and national supremacy." Without a high degree of national spirit and patriotic spirit, it is impossible to carry out a long-term and victorious war of national liberation. Without national thought, there will be no national liberation movement. Moreover, the War of Resistance we are waging is against a powerful Japanese . To defeat this most oriental aggressor, everything must be for the front line and everything must be for victory, which is the true meaning of "military first and victory first." Similarly, we must be able to win victory in the War of Resistance in the long-term War of Resistance, we must concentrate all our will and mobilize all our strength to strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance, which is the true meaning of "concentration of will and concentration of strength."</p>
<p>Under this common goal, carrying out the spiritual mobilization of the whole country is a method of strengthening the mobilization of the strength of the War of Resistance. Hold on to the determination to resist the war to the end, adhere to the confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, highly promote the national spirit and patriotic spirit, improve the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence, contribute their strength to the strength of the country, everything for the front line, everything for victory, for the improvement of politics, for the development of the mass movement, for the establishment of wartime life, concentrate all will, mobilize all strength to strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance, the absolute integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation, and the establishment of the Three People's Principles of a new China.</p>
<p>In order to grasp the central content and make a correct understanding of the "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline," to deeply understand the masses, and to make this movement easier to carry out, I would like to generalize the content described in this outline as follows:</p>
<p>(1), Determination to adhere to the War of Resistance;</p>
<p>(2), Confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance;</p>
<p>(3), National self-confidence and self-esteem;</p>
<p>(4), Improvement of politics;</p>
<p>(5), Development of the mass movement;</p>
<p>(6), Establishment of wartime life.</p>
<p>(1) As far as the determination to adhere to the War of Resistance is concerned, it is a center of our spiritual mobilization, because the purpose of national spiritual mobilization is to achieve the determination to adhere to the War of Resistance to the end. Some against the war, surrender and compromise, they fundamentally have no determination to adhere to the War of Resistance. They have opposed the War of Resistance from the first day of the War of Resistance, or they have wavered about the War of Resistance. Such as the national traitor, from the beginning of the War of Resistance, there was no decision on the War of Resistance, and whenever the War of Resistance encountered difficulties, he openly advocated surrender, and finally openly betrayed the Chinese nation and surrendered to Japan. Some who wavered about the War of Resistance constantly expressed opposition and doubt about the national policy of adhering to the War of Resistance, and wanted to take various methods to move towards the road of peaceful compromise. As the outline says: "The establishment of national spirit must be persistent and unswerving. If it is swayed by external oppression and temptation, then this spirit is still insufficient to complete an extraordinary cause." Firmly establishing the determination of the people of the whole country to resist the war is an important task of spiritual mobilization. How can we achieve the determination to firmly resist the war? The central point here is to be able to explain the situation of the War of Resistance universally and deeply, and the center of the explanation is to have a "Japan is our person" in everyone's mind, which is to promote the spirit of "having without me" and "irreconcilable hatred," so that the people of the whole country understand that until Japan is eliminated, our responsibility for the War of Resistance will not be fulfilled, and our determination to resist the war cannot be abandoned for a day.</p>
<p>(2) As far as confidence in the War of Resistance is concerned, this is a necessary condition for strengthening the determination to resist the war. If the War of Resistance has no future, if the War of Resistance has no prospect of victory, then it is naturally difficult to adhere to the determination to resist the war. Therefore, in spiritual mobilization, we must make detailed and concrete explanations of the conditions and prospects for China's War of Resistance to achieve victory, which is what the outline says: "To seek victory in the first place and victory in the first place," "The sole purpose of the military is to seek victory, then the people must establish a belief in certain victory to achieve the purpose of final victory." "The purpose of our War of Resistance is to achieve the victory of the War of Resistance. With confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, the determination to adhere to the War of Resistance will be more consolidated. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e2">× Plane Indiscriminate Bombing of Chongqing Incident <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>On May 3rd and 4th, × planes indiscriminately bombed Chongqing, causing an unprecedented tragedy in human history. Gazing from afar in Xindu, thousands of our compatriots suffered the misfortune of being smashed to pieces, and tens of thousands of compatriots suddenly endured the pain of losing their families and fortunes. Truly, one knows not where to turn for tears! Moreover, foreign embassies, consulates, and friendly nations' people also suffered unwarranted disasters. For us, this evokes particularly unbearable feelings! Nevertheless, regarding this unprecedented catastrophe in Chongqing, it is necessary to make further observations.</p>
<p>The reckless bombing of Chongqing, our wartime capital, by the × people this time is by no means a simple military act, but contains a rather significant political conspiracy. The purpose of this × act by the Japanese × is firstly to use it to flaunt that the Japanese army still has the power to continue attacking and destroying everything, and attempt to ××</p>
<p>×× to make the British side underestimate our country's resistance and value the Japanese ×'s power of threat, change their aid-China policy, mediate the war of resistance against Japan, and pressure our country to yield. The second is to use this × act to threaten and subdue our government and people, to embark on the road of 'anti-communism' and 'peace talks' for those × and others who surrender and betray the country, and to embark on the road of subjugation and national destruction through 'peace' and 'mediation'. Therefore, if our resistance war does not stop for a day, if China does not perish for a day, then this kind of × act by the Japanese × will certainly continue and intensify day by day. The crazy bombing of Chongqing is only the beginning; the successive tragic bombings of Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Chaozhou are also due to the same reason. In the future, the Japanese × may have even more ×× and ×× acts. As the Japanese Navy Ministry spokesman said on the 6th, "Japanese planes have attacked Chongqing and other strongholds three times and will continue to do so and will intensify" (Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<p>However, every Chinese who is unwilling to be a slave has already recognized clearly, and every international person of insight has also recognized clearly that the Japanese ××ist invasion of China has suffered twenty-two months of strong resistance and has begun to enter a state of major difficulty. Now the Japanese invasion of China 'enterprise', whether military speculation, adventure, or political 'anti-communism', 'peace' and 'mediation', has been attacked by the Chinese government, army and all the people. The power of this attack is still increasing day by day. Along with the strengthening of this anti-Japanese force, the internal crisis of the Japanese invaders, especially within the army, is becoming increasingly serious, and the international position of the Japanese invaders is becoming increasingly isolated and precarious. Under this new situation, the Japanese invasion of China 'enterprise' can only enter a disastrous defeat and lead to eternal ruin, which is a fact that can be known without divination. In order to save this doom, the Japanese × people stop at nothing and take more ×× means. Therefore, the tragic bombing of Chongqing and other places cannot be taken as evidence that the Japanese military power has not suffered a greater blow, and even less as evidence that the Japanese military power can still boast, as it did in the first phase of the war, of 'advancing straight in and being invincible everywhere'. On the contrary, it proves the Japanese ×'s desperation! Every one of our compatriots who is unwilling to be a subjugated slave will not only not be worried and fearful, but will instead increase their hatred for the Japanese × and increase their confidence in winning the war. We believe that people of friendly nations will also have this kind of understanding and will strengthen their determination to aid China and restrain Japan.</p>
<p>What we still want to particularly point out here to overseas Chinese readers and leaders from all walks of life is: First, this kind of × act by the Japanese × will have more ×× and ×× and ×× performances, along with the gradual completion of the military stalemate and with the gradual aggravation of the military and political difficulties of the Japanese × invasion of China! Therefore, on the one hand, we must step up the relief work in Chongqing and other places, and on the other hand, we must step up all preventive work. Regarding the former, we should immediately carry out condolence and fundraising relief work, etc. The condolence work must be enthusiastic and widespread, and the fundraising work must be conscientious and effective, and be handled publicly by the national bank and accounting institutions. Regarding the latter, we should step up the mobilization of young people and experts to return to the country to serve, strengthen the front-line forces, and strengthen rear defense; we should especially step up the donation movement, enhance our country's air defense and anti-poison tools, and cultivate a large number of air defense and anti-poison talents. Second, this kind of × act by the × people, especially the tragic disaster suffered by the embassies and consulates of various friendly nations in Chongqing this time, is a fact, and cannot be concealed by any defense from the × people. This kind of × act is not only a threat to the Chinese people and international people, but also a threat and insult to all righteous mankind! Therefore, we must collect concrete materials, especially the tragic situation of the bombing of our Chinese people and foreigners' properties, expand international publicity work, and strive for greater international sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, we respectfully express our boundless sympathy and boundless respect to the compatriots in Chongqing and other places who were bombed, to the people of friendly nations, and to the various newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao, New China News, New Sichuan, and Sichuan! We firmly believe that your sacrifice and pain today have a huge price, and that all the people of our country, all overseas Chinese, and all righteous people in the world will be your most loyal and enthusiastic supporters!</p>

Our officers and soldiers fought bravely and fiercely. The × were unable to resist, so they fired poison gas at us, poisoning more than a dozen of our soldiers. After fierce fighting until the afternoon, we finally defeated the stubborn ×. At the same time, another unit of ours defeated all of the × in Shan Kuigou (west of Heilongguan) and Song Jiafen (north of Heilongguan). The remaining × fled to Heilongguan, and we are currently attacking it. In this battle, more than 70 × were killed.</p>

Another route, more than 200 people with two cannons, fled from Quting Town (southeast of Hongdong) to Guluo (east of Quting). After being intercepted by us, they retreated to Shijiatan Lijiahuan (one li southeast of Gu*). Another route invaded Dahongyuan from Zuocun for more than a day. On the morning of the 1st, they were ambushed by us and retreated to Rijia Gou (ten li west of Gu*), and then joined the × of Guluo. On the 2nd, they invaded and occupied Gu County Town (east of Hongdong). Currently, there are more than a thousand × stacked in Gu County Town, seemingly continuing to attack eastward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 7th] In the mountainous area northwest of Hejin, there have been repeated fierce battles since the beginning of last month. On the 28th of last month, more than 100 × were killed or wounded near the 80th Pass (northwest of Guzhen).

<p>[Min Ge Agency, Wuyuan, 7th] On the 19th of last month, six planes suddenly bombed Liang He Fan Town south of us, killing or wounding more than 70 merchants and residents, and scattering the Ta Kung Pao and Xinhua News, which called for anti-Party, anti-Communist, and peaceful coexistence. Afterwards, the advisor of Tuoketuo County said that it was our planes that carried and scattered them, and that they were trying to lure our people by giving each person 50 yuan to console the people killed or injured by the × planes. After investigation by our ×, the fragments in the bombs had the words "Showa 12 Osaka". The scattered newspapers were also small 16-page newspapers, the content of which was purely in the tone of the × people, showing the position of the × puppet. It was obviously forged by the × people, intending to alienate our people's hearts. Moreover, the Japanese planes flew very high at that time, and some people found that the wings still had the red sun type, and the fuselage was gray, which fully proves the desperation of the Japanese ×. We express our admiration and congratulations for the victory of our anti-Japanese war.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 6th] Editors of various Chinese newspapers in Shanghai have decided that for any news that is easily censored, rather than submitting it to the Shanghai Municipal Council in the concession to seek permission to publish it, they would rather voluntarily suspend the publication of such news temporarily. They have also submitted a request to the government to lodge a protest with the British and American sides.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A Shanghai dispatch states that the Shanghai Evening Post editorial commented that, from a legal point of view, it is questionable whether the police station has the right to inspect foreign publications or the right to publish and sell them. Furthermore, even if there is a major provocative incident, it should be resolved in accordance with the laws of various countries. According to American law, even if this incident occurs, there is no reason to be punished in fact. From other aspects, we should also have great sympathy for the difficulties currently encountered by foreigners in the two concessions in Shanghai. However, if the Municipal Council authorities interfere with the appropriate publication of news and fair commentary on speeches, we will regard this improper restriction as serious and consider resisting. In other words, we would rather stop publishing in Chinese. The English Shanghai Evening Post and the Chinese Shanghai Evening Post will not be censored.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 7th] The Navy Ministry spokesman here stated yesterday that the Japanese side will continue to intensify the indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing and other Chinese military locations until the National Government collapses. Regarding the bombing of the British Consulate, the Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai stated that, according to the Domei News Agency, Japanese planes saw about 50 anti-aircraft guns located near the British, French, and German consulates, with dense artillery fire, so bombing was necessary. But they added that it was inevitable to accidentally drop bombs during bombing.</p>
<p>[Local News] According to the English-language "Sunday Post," American Chaffers, a sales representative at the Hong Kong office of Pan American Airlines, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Chongqing on a Meiya aircraft. Before leaving Chongqing, he witnessed the bombing by × planes and strongly refuted the × side's sophistry. According to him, the British and American consulates are located in the residential area on the opposite bank of the city center of Chongqing. The residents of this residential area are mostly foreigners. There are very few Chinese residences near the two consulates, and there are absolutely no offices of Chinese military and political authorities. The French Consulate office is on the opposite bank of the British and American Consulates and is closely linked with the Chinese government office.</p>
<p>Embassies and Consulates of Various Countries.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason for the bombing of and near the British Consulate. According to reports, many bullets hit the area of foreign embassies and consulates in Chongqing, killing 25 Chinese and wounding 50. Mr. John Teou Diaon, the private secretary of the British Ambassador to China, was also injured while participating in the emergency rescue of the dead and wounded. According to Chaffers, he observed from the roof of the Pan American Airlines office in Chongqing that the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery equipment was very sparse. He had never heard the sound of anti-aircraft artillery, only machine guns set up in high places firing at the × planes. As for protection, the machine guns were useless. They fired a row of machine gun bullets every five minutes, but they were far from the target. The altitude of the × planes was 8,000 feet. From his professional point of view, he said that the × planes had absolutely no reason to bomb near the British and American consulates, because there were no military targets nearby, nor were there any anti-aircraft machine guns firing nearby. The streets of Chongqing are winding and narrow, and the houses are close together. Although residents have been evacuated one after another, thousands of poor people still have to stay there and do not want to leave unless they have to. Therefore, many of them also died in this attack by × planes. As for the number of deaths and injuries, he said he really did not know.</p>
<p>Number of Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>According to the information he obtained, the number of deaths on the first day of the bombing was at least 3,000, and on the second day it was 7,000, with a total of 10,000 deaths in two days. However, this information may be exaggerated (according to yesterday's news from Chongqing, the number of deaths and injuries was between 7,000 and 8,000). In addition, there were countless people who were injured, crushed, or burned. As of the day he left Chongqing, no foreigners had been killed. The Pan American Airlines staff of three men and one woman were all safe and sound. He believed that in the short term, the number of foreigners in Chongqing would be reduced to the lowest limit, and those who could afford to leave were all preparing to leave the country. He did not know the exact number of attacks by × planes in the past two days. According to what he saw, there were 20 on the first day and 18 on the second day. There were also 20 Chinese Air Force planes that took off to respond. When the third attack came, he took the opportunity to fly to Hong Kong. The staff of the Pan American Airlines office in Chongqing will leave Chongqing in the short term. It is understood that the company is the representative in China of the American Curtiss-Wright Airplane Company and the Wah Chang Trading Corporation. The military products of both factories are world-renowned.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch, according to a telegram from New York on the 5th, the Democratic New York Times commented on the repeated bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes, saying that the military actions of the time of Genghis Khan have now reappeared. The only difference is that the battlefield has changed from the ground to the sky. This kind of combat method is not only seen in the Sino-Japanese War, but is almost the same in all modern wars. In comparison with two centuries ago, it is certainly more barbaric, but in comparison with a thousand years ago, it may not be more civilized, and in comparison with the combat methods of barbarian nations, it cannot be said that the level of civilization is superior to theirs.</p>

<p>[Haitong Agency, Beiping, 7th] Yesterday, on Saturday, the spokesman for the Japanese military authorities stationed in Tianjin lodged a serious protest with the British and French concession authorities, saying that the concessions have failed to make efforts to suppress anti-Japanese and Communist elements, causing frequent disturbances in the consular districts, concessions, and foreign military garrisons in Tianjin and Beiping. If the concession authorities continue to harbor anti-Japanese organizations, the Japanese army will have no choice but to take appropriate steps to defend itself and maintain peace and order.

It was not until night that the British Ambassador returned to the British Consulate to survey the damage. At the time of the bombing, acting Chinese Counselor Peng Boting, First Secretary Greenway, and Consul General Du Lou and his wife were all in the Consulate and witnessed everything. Two bombs hit the building where the British diplomatic corps resided, but the bombs slid from the roof to the ground before exploding. All the glass windows were shattered immediately. The house where Du Lou and his wife lived was hit by four bombs and completely exploded, causing considerable damage, but Du Lou and his wife were both unharmed. Diplomatic corps and consulate officials used dim lights to try their best to rescue the injured Chinese.

<p>× After suffering setbacks in its fierce attack on Zhanggu'nao, it shifted its main force to attack Gaoyou City, ten li southeast, while using a part of its force to attack Yunhua Mountain, twelve li northwest of Xiangfu Temple. Gaoyou City was breached by × at 2:20 PM. In the Lianhua Mountain area, × engaged in hand-to-hand combat with us, throwing hand grenades at each other, and its casualties were more than double ours. ×, out of shame and anger, also released tear gas and suffocating poisonous gas, poisoning more than 150 officers and soldiers. Battalion Commander Li Shi, realizing the lack of gas masks, took advantage of ×'s attack stalling and launched a counterattack. As a result, although we suffered more than 350 casualties, including Battalion Commander Li being seriously wounded, ×'s casualties exceeded 500, and we finally repelled them.</p>
<p>From 3:00 AM on the 31st, × repeatedly attacked the Xiangfu Temple area but was repelled each time. At noon, × infantry of over a thousand, with four cannons, launched another fierce attack on Yunhua Mountain, occasionally releasing poisonous gas. After fierce fighting until 9:00 PM, all the officers of one of our companies were killed in action, but the soldiers still held their ground, repelling ×. This kind of calm and resolute fighting spirit is truly a unique color in the history of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Squad Leader Ren Refuses to Retreat Until Death</p>
<p>On the same day at 6:00 PM, × simultaneously released large amounts of poisonous gas at Dongtang, three li east of Xiangfu Temple, and Liubu Mountain, three li north of Lianhua Mountain. Many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned. × then launched a large-scale attack. Our troops braved the poison to meet them. At the closest range, they concentrated the firepower of light and heavy machine guns, sweeping back and forth, killing over a hundred × soldiers. × finally retreated, but we also lost two company commanders, including Liu Mingxi, and one company commander, Zeng Xianting, was wounded. Fourteen platoon leaders were killed in action and thirteen were wounded, and 384 soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>After failing to capture Lianhua Mountain and Xiangfu Temple, × increased its forces by over a thousand and, at 10:00 PM on the 31st, taking advantage of the moonlight, shifted its full force to the area between Xiangfu Temple and Lianhua Mountain, launching a fierce attack along the ancient road towards our Yangjiafang position, four li northwest of Xiangfu Temple. They concentrated artillery fire, released poisonous gas, and used seventy to eighty tanks to approach our position along the ancient road, concentrating their fire. The officers and soldiers of Li Lin'yun, who were defending the area, suffered heavy casualties, leaving only seven men, and the company commander was also killed in action. × then occupied the high ground west of Yangjiafang. At this time, Staff Sergeant Squad Leader Ren Jun'an, who was defending the opposite mountain, still led six soldiers to hold the position without retreating, while sending troops to report and firing. As a result, even after breaking through our position, × was still unable to sweep left and right. Later, ××× Brigade Commander received the report and personally led a reserve team to counterattack, fighting fiercely throughout the night, and × was unable to advance further.</p>
<p>At dawn on April 1st, × continued to implement its sweeping plan, attempting to expand its gains. × Brigade Commander again personally led his troops, fearlessly charging into the front lines, bravely sweeping through the enemy. × suffered over a thousand casualties, and we also suffered heavy losses. Suddenly, a dumdum bullet was fired from ×'s position, seriously wounding × Brigade Commander in the leg. × managed to break through with another seven to eight hundred men, accompanied by seventy to eighty tanks. Fortunately, the other positions had not been shaken, and only Yangjiafang was in a state of melee. One side was able to reinforce its troops and drive out the × soldiers who had broken through, while the other side ordered ××'s troops to deploy a second line of defense.</p>
<p>×'s advance was greatly delayed due to our pincer attacks from both flanks and the frontal melee. After a long and arduous battle until evening, it was finally difficult to block them. Especially in northeastern Gao'an, the earth mounds were visible to each other, with continuous and sloping ravines, making them easy to climb. Tanks could move everywhere. In order to avoid a decisive battle with the communists, we retreated to the area five li west of Gao'an City on the 2nd according to the established plan. × did not gradually enter the city until the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<p>From the 4th, although × repeatedly harassed westward, they were repelled with losses. On the 6th, we took advantage of the transfer of a part of ×'s forces and launched a sudden counterattack. On the morning of the 7th, we pressed on to the outskirts of Gao'an City. × tightly closed the southwest and north gates, leaving the east gate half-open. Residents and travelers could only use the north gate.</p>
<p>Why ×'s Casualties Were More Than Double Ours</p>
<p>This battle lasted a total of eight days. × suffered over three thousand casualties, while our casualties were only over three hundred. There are reasons why ×'s casualties were more than double ours.</p>
<p>(1) × attacked while we defended, and the casualties of the attacker are often greater than those of the defender.</p>
<p>(2) The × 106th Division suffered a disastrous defeat in De'an last October. Although it had been reorganized for four months, its combat effectiveness was far weaker than last year. Even its use of light and heavy machine guns was mostly continuous firing, lacking knowledge of intermittent firing, proving that its training was still lacking.</p>
<p>(3) ×'s artillery was mostly used to capture Nanchang. Only twelve cannons were used in the Gao'an area. Due to continuous cloudy and rainy weather, the aircraft's ability to operate was limited, so it had to rely on large amounts of poisonous gas, releasing it more than twenty times in succession. However, the victory or defeat of poison gas warfare is not decisive. On the contrary, it increases the morale of our soldiers against the enemy.</p>
<p>(4) The high morale and strong fighting spirit of our troops, their calm and brave combat, are truly admirable and praiseworthy. For example, Liu Daming, the deputy regimental commander, bravely charged with his troops and continued to serve while wounded; Platoon Leader Liu Chaochang took the lead and commanded calmly; Staff Sergeant Platoon Attaché Li Jun of the communications company carried out the telephone switchboard even when surrounded by ×; Staff Sergeant Squad Leader Wei Shijie led his soldiers to recapture the lost high ground during the battle of Xiangfu Temple, allowing the position to turn from danger to safety; Staff Sergeant Squad Leader Yu Junming firmly held his position for two days and nights even when surrounded by ×'s artillery and poisonous gas and suffering heavy casualties; Private Liu Yonghai took command of the entire squad and firmly held the position without retreating after the squad leader was wounded and the fortifications were completely destroyed; Lieutenant Platoon Leader Pang Songshan firmly held his stronghold and calmly responded to changes, stabilizing the situation after the company commander was killed in action. These heroic deeds are the biggest reason for the massive elimination of ×× in this battle, and also the biggest guarantee for winning the final victory.</p>
<p>××'s westward advance after occupying Nanchang only reached Gao'an. This may be ××'s strategic decision, but its failure to expand its gains and continue westward is also due to the unexpectedly large setback suffered by the ×× army in the Battle of Gao'an. (Note: Gao'an was recaptured on April 23rd. This letter was sent out five days later, so it does not mention it.) April 28, 18th year. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Financial Center Shifts Inward, Banking Industry Flourishes in Southwest, Cooperation Among Provinces Gradually on Track, Using Idle Funds to Develop the Interior <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] Shanghai has always been the financial center of the country. After the war, the center shifted to the southwestern provinces, especially Chongqing and Kunming in Sichuan and Yunnan. The reserve funds of the four major banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank) have long been moved to safe areas. The number of branches in West China and South China has increased sharply. In order to concentrate their strength, the banks have proposed merging their operations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Distribution of Wartime Banks by Region</p>
<p>Banks are divided by the geographical distribution of their headquarters and branches: East China has 87 headquarters and 573 branches, North China has 16 headquarters and 347 branches, Central China has 11 headquarters and 279 branches, West China has 17 headquarters and 195 branches, South China has 12 headquarters and 199 branches, Northeast has 30 branches, Northwest has 3 headquarters and 26 branches, Overseas has 12 headquarters and 42 branches. In total, there are 158 headquarters and 1,691 branches, totaling 1,849. Compared with before the war: (1) The number of headquarters decreased by 3 in East China, 1 in West China, and 2 in South China; (2) The number of branches decreased by 12 in North China and increased by 1 in East China, 12 in Central China, 28 in West China, 29 in South China, and 6 overseas.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Branches in Chartered Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>Bank classification: (Headquarters) Commercial savings banks decreased by 3, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, specialized banks decreased by 2; (Branches) Central and chartered banks increased by 23, provincial and municipal banks increased by 33, commercial savings increased by 7, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, specialized and overseas Chinese banks each increased by 1. The following are the records of various banks in the past two years: (1) Central and Chartered (Previous Year) 4 headquarters, 491 branches; (Last Year) 4 headquarters, 514 branches; (2) Provincial and Municipal (Previous Year) 26 headquarters, 464 branches; (Last Year) 26 headquarters, 497 branches; (3) Commercial Savings (Previous Year) 73 headquarters, 408 branches; (Last Year) 70 headquarters, 415 branches; (4) Specialized Agricultural, Industrial and Overseas Chinese (Previous Year) 61 headquarters, 264 branches; (Last Year) 58 headquarters, 265 branches.</p>
<p>Paid-Up Capital of 400 Million Yuan</p>
<p>In terms of the paid-up capital of banks, provincial and municipal banks increased by 300,000 yuan, commercial savings banks increased by 100,000 yuan, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 80,000 yuan, and specialized banks decreased by 140,000 yuan. The following are the records of paid-up capital in the past two years: (1) Central and Chartered (Previous Year) 167.500 yuan; (Last Year) 167.500 yuan; (2) Provincial and Municipal (Previous Year) 76.884 yuan; (Last Year) 79.884 yuan; (3) Commercial Savings (Previous Year) 83.248 yuan; (Last Year) 84.248 yuan; (4) Agricultural and Industrial (Previous Year) 29.486 yuan; (Last Year) 28.686 yuan; (5) Specialized (Previous Year) 19.539 yuan; (Last Year) 18.139 yuan; (6) Overseas Chinese (Previous Year) 57.645 yuan; (Last Year) 57.645 yuan. The above units are in thousands of yuan. As of 1938, the total paid-up capital of all banks was 436.1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Concentration of Power, Merged Operations</p>
<p>In the past, the problem with banking operations was that they competed with each other instead of cooperating with each other. As a result, financial power had several negative impacts on the social economy. Before the implementation of the new currency system, they competed in real estate, bid for public bonds, and speculated in foreign exchange. Only after the implementation of the new currency system did they gradually move towards a proper path. In order to concentrate power, the banking industry proposed merging the operations of various banks. The actual implementation occurred successively with the merger of the Jiangzhe Bank and the Zhonghui Bank, the merger of the Taiping Bank and the Guoji Bank, and the joint operation of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank and the Jiangsu Bank. After the war, the ChuanKang Bank, the Chongqing Civilian Bank, and the Sichuan Commercial Bank merged to form the ChuanKang Civilian Bank. Guangdong Industrial and Sichuan Silk Industry merged with the Guangdong Provincial Bank.</p>
<p>Using Idle Funds to Develop the Interior</p>
<p>After the war, banks in Shanghai all had a surplus of idle funds. Therefore, banks in Shanghai and other places reduced deposit interest rates to lighten the burden. However, the banks, entrusted by the depositors and for their own future, after repeated and careful consideration of the use of funds, believe that using idle funds to develop the interior is the most appropriate way at present. At the same time, it can assist the government in completing the construction of the interior and developing the rich resources of the southwest. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Fujian Provincial Bank have successively established agricultural departments to develop agriculture in the interior with all their strength, so as to increase their agricultural products and facilitate the export of local products. Some banks have also established trust departments to handle trust matters in order to adapt to the complex economic structure. As for the closure of banks after the war, there were actually only three, but Hengli has already resumed operations.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Full Text of Anglo-Turkish Agreement to Be Released Today, Anglo-Soviet Negotiations in Critical Stage, France Declares Maintenance of Franco-Soviet Agreement <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Ankara, 6th) Reports from Angola state that the Anglo-Turkish agreement has been completed, cooperating to maintain security in the Mediterranean. The terms of the agreement will be announced simultaneously in the Turkish National Assembly and the British House of Commons on Sunday. All developments have been notified to the Soviet government at all times. The Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister, carrying new government instructions, hurriedly left for Moscow this afternoon. Before departing, he held secret talks with various leaders.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Paris, 6th) News has just been received here from the Turkish capital that Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin of the Soviet Union discussed the defense of Central and Eastern European countries with the Turkish authorities. The signatory countries of the Eastern Locarno Pact, namely Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan, recently held a meeting in Tehran and resolved to authorize Turkey to represent them in diplomatic initiatives. The Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey are adjacent to each other, and there is a relationship of mutual support.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 7th) Potemkin arrived in Germany from Turkey yesterday and will arrive here at 1:00 PM today. After visiting the Bulgarian Prime Minister, he will travel to the Romanian capital at 10:00 PM tonight.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 6th) It is claimed here that the United Kingdom will lend a large sum of money to Greece. Anglo-Greek trade negotiations are scheduled to begin in Athens on May 13. The British delegation will be headed by Leeds Ross.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, 7th) The British reply to the Soviet government was delivered to Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 6th) According to official announcements, the purpose of the United Kingdom's new proposal is to recruit the Soviet Union into the Anglo-French security front. Its issuance has been delayed because "a second consideration is necessary." Although it was previously reported that it had been delivered to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds, this is not the case. However, it will be sent out soon. Chamberlain himself will revise the note and draft it again. The original note did not accept the Soviet proposal for a military mutual assistance agreement, but still retained room for a final military agreement.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 6th) A few minutes after the Soviet Ambassador left the British Foreign Office today, Halifax went to the Prime Minister's residence to discuss the recommendations of the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee and the discussions with Maisky. Before lunch, the Foreign Minister also discussed the situation with Undersecretary of State Cadogan. Political sources say that the United Kingdom's final revised reply to the Soviet Union seems to have a conciliatory tone. The United Kingdom still insists that the Soviet Union should independently agree to assist Eastern European countries that are invaded. If the Soviet Union agrees to this, a three-power military alliance may be possible.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 7th) Today's editorials in various newspapers and reports from various diplomatic correspondents all focus on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Most opinions believe that the negotiations have reached a critical stage because the British government is only willing to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to provide assistance when the Baltic and Balkan countries are attacked. However, the Soviet Union insists that the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union form a military agreement and that the small countries of Eastern and Western Europe be attached to it. The "Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent stated that unless the Soviet Union is prepared to compromise, these talks will be in danger of breaking down. He also stated that "the final conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is critical to the Anglo-Soviet negotiations." The "Observer" diplomatic correspondent added, "The Soviet Union has consistently stated that small countries have high expectations, hoping that the peace group is truly effective and reliable, and this cannot be achieved without a full military alliance of the three major powers. If the three countries continue to hesitate, the small countries may be in danger at any time. The difficulty for the United Kingdom is that it believes that a formal military alliance is sufficient for Germany to regard it as a pretext for an encirclement policy, which in turn may trigger a crisis that it is trying to avoid. At the same time, the Soviet Union believes that without a full alliance, a crisis may also be triggered. Therefore, this issue has become a stage of mutual maneuvering." The "Observer" editorial stated, "As the organization of the peace group is now beginning, the British government must answer this question: Is a halfway measure effective or will it make the current situation worse than before?"</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 6th) Officials here expressed disappointment with the United Kingdom's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal to form a military alliance and resist Hitler. At the same time, France reiterated its maintenance of the 1935 Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. It is reported that Moscow has informed France that the Soviet Union has no intention of adopting isolationism or compromising with Germany. According to France's opinion, the United Kingdom's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal does not mean that the actions of the United Kingdom and France to jointly guarantee the territorial integrity of the countries surrounding Germany have failed.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 6th) The French Foreign Minister reported to the French Cabinet today on the negotiations with Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, and Turkey to form a peace front; and explained the United Kingdom's counterproposal to the Soviet Union's proposal to form a three-power military alliance; and reiterated the Pope's efforts for peace. The French Cabinet passed six decrees, signed by President Lebrun. The decrees include national defense preparations and banning foreign newspapers in France.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Large Numbers of German Bombers Concentrated Near Polish Border, Hitler to Watch Reaction of Britain and United States, Poland to Convene Parliament Tomorrow <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 6th) According to reliable reports, large numbers of German bombers are concentrated near the Polish border. Although the news has caused great shock in French public opinion, there is still hope that a further increase in tension can be avoided. The French side has a strong tendency to hope that Italy will serve as a mediator. The French side hopes that because Mussolini is unwilling to wage war against Poland, he can automatically persuade Hitler to adopt a more moderate strategy. In addition, close attention is also being paid to the issue of Slovakia. Military movements are extremely frequent in the Slovak territory close to Poland's industrial center. There are two reasons for this emphasis: (1) the threat to Poland's vital point, and (2) today's rumors that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are jointly discussing the partition of Slovakia by Germany, Italy, and Hungary. The latest intelligence regarding the German army is summarized as follows: Aircraft and other supplies have been concentrated in large quantities on the Polish border. It is understood that the Polish side has also made preparations. However, the number of German troops concentrated on the Polish border is not extremely large, so a direct invasion of Poland may not occur immediately.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 6th) Wilhelmstrasse has so far refused to express Germany's attitude towards Beck's speech. There is not a word of commentary in the Nazi newspapers. Beck's speech and Poland's reply to Germany's memorandum on the abolition of the German-Polish agreement are currently being studied in detail. It is understood that Hitler will observe how Britain and the United States react to this before expressing his personal opinions. However, the Nazi Party and political circles have particularly raised four points for discussion: (1) They particularly emphasized the right of the people of Danzig to self-determination; (2) They refused to accept the view that Poland has great interests in Danzig because Danzig is located at the mouth of the Vistula River; (3) They believe that the German-Polish agreement stipulates that neither contracting party may freely unite with other countries to oppose the other contracting party; (4) They expressed disagreement with Beck's statement that Germany's proposals were not delivered to Poland in full.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th) German attention is not focused on Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech, but on the activities of Wilhelmstrasse. Its countermeasures to the current European situation can be expressed as "breaking the British encirclement." Germany's foreign policy places everything else in a secondary position, focusing exclusively on diplomatic struggles with Britain. This has become increasingly clear. In order to achieve this goal, Germany's foreign policy may unexpectedly change its course. However, everything depends on the outcome of the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Ribbentrop visited Hitler at his mountain villa in Munich last night before setting off for Italy.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 6th) According to sources in political circles here, there will be no major decisions regarding the Danzig issue at present. However, there are also those who advocate holding a plebiscite in Danzig, believing that the return of Danzig to Germany or the maintenance of the status quo of the Free City should be decided by the people themselves. Well-informed sources have barely confirmed that Hitler did meet with the leaders of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Greiser and Forster, yesterday. This means that Ribbentrop had already learned the wishes of the Danzig leaders and carried Hitler's instructions when he went to Milan.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Warsaw, 6th) The "Daily Newspaper" here wrote, "The world has unanimously recognized that if Germany wants to seek understanding with Poland, it should provide concrete evidence. Now that Poland has made its attitude clear, it is time for Germany to speak." The "Polish Daily" also said, "Berlin must now choose one of two paths, and one of the paths is the path of peace." The "Sas Newspaper," the representative newspaper of the conservatives, said that the return of German Ambassador Moltke to Warsaw yesterday may mean that the German side has made some suggestions. The Polish Parliament has scheduled a plenary session for the 9th to discuss the granting of privileges to the President to promulgate appropriations to strengthen national defense. The Senate is scheduled to convene a plenary session on the 11th.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Pope's Broadcast Yesterday, Praying for Peace; Rumored to Have Taken Diplomatic Steps to Assist in Resolving the German-Polish Dispute <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 7th] The Pope delivered a broadcast speech today in Algiers to the French National Eucharistic Congress, briefly stating that mankind earnestly desires peace. The Pope said that in mid-May he would do his utmost to offer extensive prayers, hoping that the Holy Mother would grant us peace from Heaven. We are now earnestly hoping that erroneous policies and turmoil will end soon, and that the peace of souls and the peace of the world will flourish together.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 6th] Although the nature of the Pope's broadcast speech tomorrow is unknown, local sources suggest that the Vatican's representative in Germany's visit to Ribbentrop is specifically related to the German-Polish dispute. The Holy See is eager to see a peaceful resolution to this matter and is reportedly making every effort to mediate with all parties to open up avenues for negotiation and prevent their interruption. Although the Vatican's efforts cannot be said to have had any real effect, it continues to exert its diplomatic activities in various European centers, striving for peace. It is generally speculated that the Vatican has resumed contact with Berlin, aiming to achieve mutual understanding between Germany and the Holy See.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] The Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Verdier, will make an important statement at the Eucharistic Congress to be held in Algiers tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] According to reports from Paris today, the Vatican is currently making its utmost efforts to mediate peace in Europe. Another report states that the French Foreign Minister reported to the Cabinet on the visit of the Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Verdier, yesterday. Simultaneously, the Archbishop of Berlin also visited Hitler, further strengthening the belief in the Pope's intervention for peace. The Pope may make some mention of this effort in his broadcast speech to the Eucharistic Congress in Algiers tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Since the French Foreign Minister presented a report to the Cabinet, it is believed here that the Pope has taken diplomatic steps to assist in peacefully resolving the German-Polish dispute. After the Vatican's representative in France visited Bonnet yesterday, the Vatican's representative in Germany also visited the German authorities. It is believed here that this action is related to the Pope's intervention in the Danzig issue.</p>
<h3 id="e21">German and Italian Foreign Ministers Continue Talks, Discussing General European Issues; Italy Hopes for German-Polish Negotiations <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Milan, 6th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held talks at the Governor's Office here, from 4:45 PM to 7:10 PM. Afterwards, they went out together, and the crowd, who had been waiting nearby for a long time, cheered and paid their respects. Foreign Minister Ciano then gave a statement to the newspapers, saying that the talks were very harmonious and that all issues concerning the European situation were discussed, with particular emphasis on issues related to the connection between Italy and Germany. Well-informed Italian sources also stated that the two sides shared the same views on all issues and that all matters to be discussed had been completed today. A joint communiqué will be issued tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Milan, 6th] Today's talks between the Italian and German Foreign Ministers are believed to have focused on the Danzig issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 6th] The official newspaper "Diplomatic Information," in discussing today's consultations between Ribbentrop and Ciano, said that the Milan talks would not result in any surprising events, but would reaffirm the Axis powers' determination to resist the policy of encirclement. This should not be seen as an element of war, but rather as an instrument of peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Milan, 7th] According to Fascist sources, Italy still maintains that German-Polish negotiations should continue in order to resolve the Danzig issue. Mussolini believes that the hope for a German-Polish understanding has not been extinguished by Beck's speech. It is widely believed that both Mussolini and the Pope intend to mediate the German-Polish dispute.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 6th] The newspaper "Il Tempo" commented today that Italy hopes Germany will show moderation, just as it hopes Poland will. It said: "To seek the upholding of justice, both sides must eliminate the idea of hegemony. In fact, an agreement is already halfway to being reached, and both sides have expressed a desire for a speedy peace."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] Italian newspapers, based on the official attitude, compared Beck's speech with the tone of German newspapers and concluded that the door to negotiations is not yet closed. One newspaper even said that Beck stated, "Germany only makes demands and has no concrete suggestions." This is an invitation for Germany to provide suggestions. If Hitler can accept this invitation, then negotiations can proceed, and all relevant countries can feel satisfied.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The King and Queen's Entourage Embark on a Long Sea Voyage; The "Queen of Australia" is Equipped as a Special Ship, Providing Comfortable and Spectacular Settings <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] A Reuters correspondent on board the "Queen of Australia" sent a wireless message stating that all facilities and comfortable settings on the ship were fully prepared when the King and Queen boarded. Over a thousand craftsmen transformed the passenger ship into a royal vessel in a very short time. The King and Queen's rooms are filled with flowers, creating a spectacular atmosphere. However, all facilities are based on practicality and comfort, without extravagance. The colors are mostly pale gray and cream. All interior amenities, even the smallest details, are complete. The King's electric razor has a special mechanism, and there is also a radio with a detailed list of shortwave broadcasts from across the empire. Tonight, after the King and Queen dined with the royal staff, they listened to a classical music concert. All personnel on board have been properly accommodated and are embarking on a very pleasant voyage. At the time of departure, the King and Queen watched the farewell ceremony of the Atlantic Fleet on deck. The cheers of the fleet personnel could be clearly heard as the special ship passed by, and the band of the battleship "Rodney" played the national anthem. The special ship left the Atlantic Fleet at 6:30 PM and immediately increased its speed to 17 nautical miles per hour, which will be maintained throughout the night. Three warships are escorting: the "Glasgow" and "Sandown" flank the sides, and the cruiser "Repulse" patrols behind.

<h3 id="e24">French Newspapers Reveal German Attempt to Swallow up the Soviet Union: Two Proposals Rejected by Poland; Poland Hopes to Ally with Lithuania <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Local sources say that in his recent speech, Polish Foreign Minister Beck mentioned Germany's proposal to Poland for a joint German-Polish attack on the Soviet Union, which Poland rejected, believing that such a war would only shrink its territory and be surrounded by a powerful Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 6th] The moderate "L'Ordre," the Radical Socialist "L'Oeuvre," and the right-wing "Le Figaro" all reported that Germany had suggested to Poland in March this year that they jointly attack the Soviet Union and divide its territory. "L'Oeuvre" also reported that the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Republic and Transcaucasian Republic would be assigned to Germany, while the Little Russian Republic and the Baltic coastal area would go to Poland. "Le Figaro" also said that German Air Minister General Goering had made this proposal while hunting with Polish officials in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 6th] Regarding the two proposals by the German leader to Poland for a joint attack on the Soviet Union, after some newspapers in Paris revealed this matter, well-informed sources here have now confirmed it. The first time was in February last year, when German Air Minister Goering came here on a mission. The second time was in March this year, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made a suggestion to Foreign Minister Beck. On both occasions, Germany promised that after defeating the Soviet Union, it would assign the Ukrainian Republic, the Belarusian Republic, and part of the territory of Lithuania to Poland, but this was rejected by Foreign Minister Beck. Tracing back to February of last year, after General Goering returned to his country from here, the dispute between Poland and Lithuania arose, fortunately not escalating into armed conflict. The two sides have now restored diplomatic relations and have gone from being enemies to allies. At this time, there are even discussions about concluding an alliance treaty.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 6th] Today, the Polish military newspaper stated that Poland hopes to form an alliance with Lithuania and share weal and woe, saying that Lithuania's neighbors Estonia and Latvia are both friendly to Poland. Poland can guarantee the security of these three countries, adding that time is pressing and fleeting, and a decision should be made as soon as possible.</p>

<p>May 9th is the day the Japanese ××ists first branded the Chinese nation with the mark of ×!</p>
<p>For more than twenty years, the Chinese people have struggled under double oppression to eradicate this shameful imprint. It was not until after the "July 7th" and "August 13th" incidents two years ago that national cooperation was achieved, realizing unprecedented unity between the central and local governments, the government and the people, and all ethnic groups and social strata; it was through national cooperation that the entire Chinese nation unanimously launched the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>However, eradicating the imprint cannot but involve immense suffering, and in the process of this painful struggle, the wavering of those with weak wills and the shrinking back is inevitable, and the submission of unscrupulous elements to the threats and enticements of the × people is unavoidable. Therefore, as we commemorate May 9th, this day of painful shame, more than twenty years later, we must, in addition to jointly resisting the invaders, also make every effort to oppose those who dream of becoming Yuan Shikai II, and especially to guard against the "anti-communist peace" and other conspiracies orchestrated by the likes of Wang ××!</p>
<p>The invaders and their lackeys are most afraid of us eradicating the imprint and becoming free and independent among civilized humanity! The invaders and their lackeys are most afraid of our unity and solidarity in persisting in the War of Resistance, enabling the entire nation to become free and independent from shame and suffering! They are using military adventures, political conspiracies, and the mad bombing and ×× to further brand us with the mark of shame and cruel oppression! This is what we must be doubly vigilant and doubly strive for on this anniversary of the shameful imprint. We must, on May 9th next year, celebrate this "Day of Atonement" enthusiastically!</p>

<p>Today's news reports a Reuters dispatch from London stating that Lord Listowel and four other members of the British House of Lords, and Mr. Pain and thirty-two other members of the House of Commons, sent a telegram to our Chairman Chiang to pay their respects. The telegram especially announced their sympathy and respect for the struggle of our entire people and army for national independence, unity, and freedom; the telegram also especially declared their public recognition that China's War of Resistance against Japan is in fact the main force in the world's anti-aggression struggle, and also protects peace in Europe. Therefore, they further expressed their deep sympathy and respect.</p>
<p>From this telegram, we can further recognize how our twenty-two months of persistent resistance have raised the international status of the Chinese people and the leaders of the Chinese government! We can further recognize how our twenty-two months of persistent resistance have benefited the world and influenced the world! We believe that in the future, this kind of international sympathy, aid, and contribution to the cause of world peace through persistent resistance will have even greater achievements! Here, we must strengthen our determination to support the leader's persistence in the War of Resistance, and we must make even greater efforts to advance the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression front. We must know that the increase in international sympathy and aid is, in fact, an increase in the power of resistance against Japan, and will bring forward the arrival of the final victory!</p>

<p>— Liao ChongSheng</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the isolationists, the American head of state, anyone who advocates actively participating in world politics, under the constraints of the constitution, still has the risk of leading the country into a dangerous state of actual war without the formal procedure of Congress. With the qualification of Commander of the Army and Navy, the president has the right to instruct his soldiers and fleets to go to any region at any time. In today's trend of undeclared war, this right may inevitably be misused, this is one. The original purpose of the Neutrality Law was to cleanse oneself, so as to avoid being involved in the vortex of international war. However, even in terms of the articles of this law, the US president can declare that a certain country is in a state of war, even for a country that has not declared war, as a reason to sever contact with it, and as a result, it may provoke criticism or hostile behavior from that country towards the United States, this is two. According to the tariff laws, under certain circumstances, the US commander can use tariff retaliation to cause the interruption of trade between the United States and other countries, this is three. If the president deliberately interferes in world politics, whenever he comes into contact with foreign representatives, he can accept certain obligations or deliberately provoke the anger of the other party. Once the incident occurs, the people of the country will naturally have to support him in order to maintain national dignity, this is four. Although the above words are the pretext for the isolationists to advocate weakening the president's power, objectively they adequately reflect the considerable greatness of the US president's external power. We believe that President Roosevelt, with his foresight, will be able to make good use of his power to alert the aggressors. 、 The Soviet Union is blessed with unique advantages. Since the successive implementation of the three Five-Year Plans, its resources have been considerably developed, and its heavy industry has made rapid progress. Among the great powers, the only ones that can talk about economic self-sufficiency are the United States and the Soviet Union. Its role as a major factor in world politics is obvious here.</p>
<p>The greatest mistake of the Munich Conference was alienating the Soviet Union and hoping to realize the so-called four-power agreement in a vague and ethereal space. This is exactly what the Axis countries, especially Hitler, were seeking. In other words, among the international covenants, the one that Hitler was most worried about was the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact established on May 2, 1935, because as long as this pact was not abolished, if a European war broke out again, Germany would inevitably be attacked from both sides, and this was also a major reason why it failed in 1918. No wonder Hitler was determined to abolish this pact as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Now, the preciousness of Soviet-Russian friendship has not only been repeatedly declared in the mouths of British and French officials and common people, but also the exchanges between the envoys of both sides are becoming more frequent. To recover the water that has been spilled, it is necessary to completely abandon the suspicion of Russia. However, as things have changed and feelings have shifted, whether the Soviet Union's attitude remains the same is a prerequisite for cooperation.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's diplomatic attitude is extremely clear. In short, in addition to being prepared to cooperate with democratic countries at any time according to the principle of collective security to serve as a guarantee for world peace, it will absolutely not make the slightest concession or retreat from the aggressor countries' clumsy tricks of using the threat of war to achieve their great desire for exploitation. However, it is willing to tolerate and accommodate democratic countries, and to make compromises to seek perfection. In 1927, when British-Soviet and French-Soviet relations were tense, Stalin publicly stated: "The Soviet authorities must implement their peaceful policy, even if external stimuli may damage national dignity, we will definitely ignore it." This kind of firm and far-sighted proposition has not changed so far. For example, although there is a close mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia, the Munich Conference deliberately neglected the Soviet Union. On the eve of the signing of the German-French friendship declaration last winter (December 5), the French authorities only notified the Soviet Union of the original text. These "stimuli" are not tolerable for strong countries, but Soviet Russia still remains silent, which proves that its original intention to maintain peace is still the same as before.

<h3 id="e34">Promoting the "May Fourth" Spirit: Hong Kong Youth Organizations Held a Grand Celebration of Youth Day Last Night; More Than a Thousand Youth Representatives Attended a Meeting at the Confucius Hall; Zhong Tianxin Encouraged Youth to Strengthen Self-Cultivation and Mobilize the People <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>"Youth Day" is a new creation of China this year, a groundbreaking new era for all countries in the world. How did it come about? What mission does it bear? The answer is very simple: it was won through the struggles of youth groups since the May Fourth Movement, and its mission should be to promote the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, serving as pioneers and pillars in the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>The process of establishing "Youth Day" involved the Three Principles of the People Youth League petitioning the central government to designate "May Fourth" as "Youth Day" and to designate the period from May 1st to May 7th – the most critical week of the tragic May – as Youth Movement Propaganda Week. The program of this week's movement includes "May 1st" for launching labor services to increase production efficiency; "May 2nd" for promoting various cultural propaganda; "May 3rd" for promoting conscription work, etc.; "May 4th" for holding commemorative meetings, emphasizing cleanliness, discipline, and punctuality, and striving to be role models for the people; "May 5th" for promoting healthy recreational activities; "May 6th" for launching academic work; and "May 7th" for advocating youth physical education. All the work content is closely related to the war of resistance and national reconstruction and must be popularized in all villages to deepen and strengthen it.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand the transition from "students" to "youth," from "local movements" to "strengthening youth self-cultivation" and even to "participating in the national liberation struggle." Continuing this path, the significance is so great, and youth are so glorious! We deeply congratulate the country and the nation!</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong youth are limited by their environment and cannot launch great works as vigorously as those in the mainland, they are still struggling arduously within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Regarding the "May Fourth Youth Day" student relief association and the actual actions of various schools and youth organizations, details have been reported in previous newspapers. As for the joint commemoration of Youth Day by all Hong Kong youth organizations, it was held last night – the last day of Youth Movement Week and also the anniversary of national humiliation – at the Confucius Hall.</p>
<p>Just as dusk was falling, a group in front, a team behind, marched straight towards the road on 加里連山 (possibly a transliteration of a foreign name), singing, laughing, walking and jumping, brimming with innocent enthusiasm and the vitality of life.</p>
<p>The upper and lower floors of the venue were filled with more than a thousand young friends, mostly students, and many representatives from various youth organizations. All the students of the School of Journalism also participated, hoping to strengthen their self-education in collective life. Holding the "Message to All Hong Kong Youth" distributed by the conference, the Student Relief Association's "Special Issue Celebrating Youth Day," and the "Self-Renewal Movement Covenant," they read silently and accepted with a smile.</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock, the seven representatives of the presidium – the Student Relief Association, the Youth Journalists Association, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Huiyang Youth Association, the Christian Student Federation, and the Youth Recreation Society – took their seats and solemnly proceeded with the opening ceremony. Chairman Li Zhengyao spoke about the glorious history of the May Fourth Movement and how Hong Kong youth are also progressing in this great era. Then, he explained the significance of the conference: first, to support the leader, unite the youth, and participate in the national liberation struggle; second, to improve the lives of youth – especially students – so that everyone becomes serious and moves forward. As for the responsibilities they should bear: (1) to intensify relief for refugees; (2) to strengthen international propaganda; (3) to practice thrift; (4) to promote Sino-British cultural cooperation; (5) to strengthen the great unity of youth; and (6) to raise the social status of youth.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Zhong Tianxin delivered a speech. He spoke calmly about many things that should be said to the youth; everyone listened quietly.</p>
<p>Only when "young people" can be as "mature" as adults are they good young people, which was the standard by which China used to praise youth. Mr. Zhong believes that this is completely wrong. Reviewing China's past history, from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the revolution to the current war of resistance, youth have made indelible achievements and great contributions. The meaning of Youth Day is to commemorate the glorious history of the past and to encourage future struggles for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Zhong encouraged the youth with the following four points: "Be the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures; wield knives and axes to increase national wealth and hold shields and spears to defend the country." If they do not strengthen their self-cultivation in this way, they will lose the qualities of youth and fall after a period of time. – These are very pertinent words.</p>
<p>Finally, he said: Today marks the anniversary of national humiliation. How should we commemorate national humiliation by celebrating Youth Day? The conclusion is to mobilize youth, enrich youth cadres, youth will definitely go to mobilize the people, and the people will definitely generate great power to strive for the early arrival of final victory. – This is Mr. Zhong's experience in mobilization work and his emphasis on youth and the people. Everyone responded with warm applause.</p>
<p>With the interlude of singing, the atmosphere of the venue changed from solemn to lively. "The Chinese nation will not perish!" "The Chinese nation will not perish!" "..." shouted from everyone's hearts, touching everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>After the harmonica performance, Mr. Jiang Wenhan, Vice Chairman of the World Christian Student Federation, gave a speech. He came from working in the mainland and spoke very movingly: first, to recognize that this era is a great era; second, spiritual mobilization is the foundation of all mobilization work; and third, to recognize one's own position and task.</p>
<p>After another round of singing, Zheng Dechao introduced the "Youth Self-Renewal Movement Covenant," encouraging everyone to abide by it together: (1) Improve interest levels and choose healthy entertainment; (2) Strengthen group life and promote the spirit of discipline; (3) Increase research interest and cultivate scientific minds; (4) Eliminate extravagant habits and develop thrifty habits; (5) Deepen spiritual cultivation and enhance service effectiveness. The full text, with a total of twenty-eight articles, was detailed in yesterday's newspaper. This is a concrete standard of spiritual mobilization for youth self-cultivation. Everyone applauded enthusiastically and agreed. Let's meet again in action! – The meeting ended happily at around 10 o'clock. (Qi Zhuo)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Another Pirate Attack on a Cargo Boat in the Waters of Sam Mun Tsai Yesterday; One Boat Companion Was Shot and Injured Before Being Thrown into the Sea; Wood Oil and Other Items Were Robbed, Resulting in a Loss of More Than Three Thousand Dollars <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>In the waters near Hong Kong, piracy is rampant. Cargo boats and fishing boats passing by are often robbed by bandits. Recently, it has become more and more fierce, almost without a day passing without incident. On the 6th of this month, in the waters of Sam Mun Tsai, another cargo boat was robbed by more than twenty pirates who fired guns. One boat companion was injured and thrown into the sea. Goods worth more than three thousand dollars were looted. Afterwards, the boat owner returned to Hong Kong and reported the case to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sam Mun Tsai Waters: Suddenly Encountering a Bandit Boat</p>
<p>The robbed cargo boat was T2126H. The boat owner, Fang Er (38 years old), reported to the police station that the boat set sail from 甲子 (Jiazi) in the Chinese territory on the afternoon of the 4th of this month to transport goods to Hong Kong. At about 8 o'clock in the morning on the 6th, when the boat was in the waters of Sam Mun Tsai, a speedboat suddenly appeared and sailed obliquely from the bay, chasing after the cargo boat like an arrow. Everyone on the boat knew they were not good people, so they raised the sails and rowed hard, hoping to escape, while preparing for battle. However, in the blink of an eye, the bandit boat had caught up. They saw that the boat was carrying many pirates, all holding long and short guns, with a fierce momentum, and ordered them to stop. The boat ignored them and continued to sail forward. Then, they heard the bandit boat fire several fishing cannons as a threat, but none hit the target. They continued to sail forward. Seeing that the demonstration was ineffective, the bandit boat fired dozens of gunshots in succession, shooting at the cargo boat. Bullets rained down, and the cargo boat was hit several times. They returned fire to resist, while trying to escape.</p>
<p>Boat Companion Injured; Significant Loss</p>
<p>The boat companion, Fang Binglai, was unfortunately shot and injured in the chaos and fell into the cabin. The bandit boat quickly caught up. Twenty pirates swarmed onto the boat, ordered the boat companions to gather in a corner, and began searching the boat. They robbed for about half an hour. All the items on the cargo boat were moved to the bandit boat. When the bandits were about to leave, they became even more ferocious and threw Fang Binglai into the sea before returning to their boat and roaring away. Fortunately, the injured man was quite familiar with the water. Despite his serious injuries, he was still able to float in the vast waves and drift to the waters of 虎頭門 (Tiger Head Gate). Fortunately, another boat arrived in time, rescued him, and sailed back to Hong Kong. It was not until the afternoon before yesterday that they arrived. The goods robbed this time included 212 cans of wood oil, worth 3,392 dollars, two live pigs, and 25 geese, worth a total of 100 dollars, totaling 3,492 dollars. After the police received the report, they filed it and telegraphed all district police stations to cooperate in apprehending the bandits. The injured man was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The China Youth Relief Association held a flag-granting ceremony for the departure of the first return-to-country service corps at the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM yesterday. Ambassador Xu Shiying's representative, Commissioner Deng Kunshan, Cao Xueyu, Gao Fushen, Qu Aiting, Huang Zhonghao, Lin Yetian, Pan Zhu, and other representatives of various societies, numbering over a hundred, gathered together in great numbers, making it a grand occasion. After performing the ceremony, Vice Chairman Huang Zhonghao of the association delivered a speech. Then, Pan Zhu reported on the preparation and organization of this service corps. After the report was completed, Ambassador Xu, representing Deng Kunshan, administered the oath and performed the flag-granting ceremony. Deng's representative gave a training speech after the ceremony. Cao Xueping and Qu Aiting, among others, delivered speeches in succession. Then, the team leader, Li Bingxin, gave a reply. The meeting was adjourned after a tea party and photo session. This is the first time this team has departed to return to the country to serve, and they will be traveling to the Dongjiang area for service during the day.

<h3 id="e37">The Air Defense Authorities Have Decided to Suddenly Implement a Blackout This Week; Residents Must Be Prepared to Turn Off the Lights Immediately Upon Hearing the Air Raid Siren; Implementation Is Possible at Any Time Starting Today <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Air Defense Committee has held several air defense drills and blackouts since last year, but the results of each drill have not been as good as the air defense authorities had expected. The reason for the failure is largely due to the residents' failure to fully cooperate with the air defense authorities. At the same time, due to the insufficient number of sirens, some residents did not even hear the sirens during the previous air defense drills and blackouts, which was also enough to affect the effectiveness of the drills. Now, the air defense authorities have purchased several new sirens from the United Kingdom and placed them in various appropriate locations. They were tested a few days ago, and the results were very good. Residents can rest assured that they will be aware of the sirens in future drills. It is understood that all previous blackouts were of a general nature, and the time of their implementation was announced in advance by the air defense authorities, so that residents could be prepared and not be caught off guard. As for wartime air defense drills, they have never been conducted. Now, in order to increase residents' awareness of air defense, the air defense authorities have decided to hold a wartime air defense drill this month. It has been decided in advance not to announce the time of the drill, in order to test whether residents can calmly respond to an air raid once it occurs. Also, in previous air defense drills, residents often liked to form groups and travel on the streets during the drills, which also reduced the effectiveness of the drills. This time, the wartime air defense drill will be sudden, which should reduce this undesirable phenomenon. If there are fewer pedestrians on the streets, the degree of tension will naturally increase, and the situation is expected to be less lax than before. It is heard that the air defense authorities cannot reveal the exact date for this wartime air defense drill, but according to reliable sources, it should be within the middle of this month. Implementation is possible at any time starting today. The air defense authorities hope that residents will prepare themselves fully in advance so that they will not be caught off guard when the time comes.</p>

<h3 id="e39">The Theater Community Celebrated Ou-Yang Yuqian's Birthday; "Huanghuagang" Decided to Stage Another Charity Performance <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>--Bai Shui</p>
<p>Regularly Hold Spiritual Mobilization Oath-Taking Ceremony</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>The sensational "Huanghuagang" joint performance, which was staged for three consecutive nights from May 3rd to 5th, has once again written a glorious record and an immortal history for the Chinese theater scene.</p>
<p>At around 1 PM yesterday, the Hong Kong theater community and the "Huanghuagang" Performance Committee held a meeting at the Chinese Children's Academy to discuss various issues. Representatives from various theater troupes and officials from various departments of the conference attended, numbering more than fifty.</p>
<p>First, each department reported on the work situation and other matters of this performance. Then, several very meaningful discussions began.</p>
<p>Everyone has been working very hard in this joint performance, especially several working cadres who have devoted their greatest spirit and sacrificed their precious time to complete this massive task. However, if this has affected their own lives or careers, we should give them great sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Therefore: Since Mr. Zhan Ge's dismissal was related to his public service, the conference decided to send Hu Chunbing and Li Hua to explain and seek understanding with an official letter from the conference.</p>
<p>This matter has demonstrated the collective and indestructible power of the theater community!</p>
<p>The income from the "Huanghuagang" performance will reach nearly 3,000 dollars, but due to various reasons, the audience could not be popularized, which is a pity. In order to promote propaganda work more widely and increase income, re-staging at a lower price is a consistent requirement. As a result, after everyone's discussion, they all agreed to re-stage "Huanghuagang" in cooperation with the Hong Kong Eye Federation.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, Mr. Li Shulun put forward a very valuable suggestion, which is that Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday is approaching, so it would be best to make this re-staging a charity performance to celebrate Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian, the pioneer of the Chinese theater movement, he has the most glorious history in the Chinese theater scene. For more than thirty years, he has been fighting with a stubborn and resolute attitude. May 20th of this year is the fiftieth birthday of this great artist. In order to celebrate our theater pioneer and to provide a deep learning experience for a wide range of followers, this suggestion was immediately met with enthusiastic approval, and it was decided to re-stage "Huanghuagang" on the day of his birthday. At the same time, a "Hong Kong Theater Community Celebrating Mr. Ou-Yang Yuqian's Fiftieth Birthday Charity Performance Committee" will be organized to be responsible for future work and to coordinate various aspects to move forward together.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Li Hua put forward a similarly meaningful suggestion, which is the spiritual mobilization oath-taking ceremony of the entire Hong Kong theater community. Everyone was very excited and solemnly agreed, and decided to convene the entire Hong Kong theater community at 9 AM on May 14th (next Sunday) to hold a spiritual mobilization oath-taking ceremony, and to organize a unified and sound theater community organization in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>This is really too exciting! In the blood-stained May struggle, Hong Kong theater workers will respond to the call of the motherland in the war of resistance with heroic and decisive actions.</p>

<p>The personal registration of foreign residents in Hong Kong is progressing smoothly. As of now, 5,000 people have been registered, reaching 50% of the target foreign population in Hong Kong. The authorities hope to complete the registration by the end of next week. For the convenience of foreign registration, in addition to the Central District Registration Office, the General Post Office and the Hong Kong Tourist Association at Tsim Sha Tsui Pier have also been designated for registration. Both locations have various forms available. The authorities are no longer issuing warning notices, as foreign residents who do not register on time will be punished. The authorities are now asking shop owners to fill out forms reporting the employees who will continue to work in emergencies so that they can be assigned work when the time comes. The registration forms for Chinese people are currently being printed and will be available soon.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Modern Urban Artery: The Active Transportation Lines of Hong Kong and Kowloon <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Vehicles like flowing water, boats like swimming dragons, everything is available.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the inner workings of Hong Kong are truly as so-called "civilized," the definition of "Hong Kong as a modern civilized city" has long been unconditionally accepted by the general public. Because it is "civilized," people of all classes are particularly keen to pursue luxury and vanity, and material enjoyment is especially "complete" and "flawless." Now, let's first talk about the transportation facilities in Hong Kong and Kowloon, which are related to it. However, this is only one of the thousands of material enjoyments.</p>
<p>Although there are still many things in the transportation facilities of Hong Kong and Kowloon that need to be criticized and improved in terms of spirit, in terms of material, there is indeed nothing to criticize. In terms of transportation, the larger scale and huge projects include mountain-climbing cable cars and trams running on flat ground, followed by public buses (referred to as "buses" in Hong Kong, similarly hereinafter), and rickshaws. These are several more popular ones. As for the so-called "aristocratic" ones, in addition to the private cars exclusively owned by the rich, there is also the "taxi": however, this is only an enjoyment for the bourgeois class, and the general public does not easily enjoy it. Furthermore, if you want to seek a different flavor and don't want to exert your honorable feet, you can also leisurely and arrogantly ride the "bamboo sedan chair" carried by two people, progressing in a "snail" style, allowing you to slowly appreciate the scenery; in fact, it is no longer a means of transportation.</p>
<p>Since the transportation here is so perfect, as long as your wallet has money, you can easily reach your desired destination without exerting your honorable feet. Therefore, those who are familiar with Hong Kong often proudly say to others that no matter how you walk in Hong Kong, you will never get "lost." However, this statement is only their personal "experience." In fact, newcomers to this "noble land" are still like lonely boats in the mist, at a loss. Especially since the start of our motherland's sacred war of self-defense against Japan, a group of compatriots seeking refuge have been added here. Most of them come from the north and southwest regions, and many of them have never even been to Hong Kong in their lives. Their understanding of Hong Kong is particularly distant and naive. In a situation where they are unfamiliar with the place and people, it is certainly a very difficult task to understand the complex social situation. However, even just understanding the general transportation situation is probably not easy without someone to guide them. "The Transportation Lines of Hong Kong and Kowloon" may be written specifically for them. In the eyes of old Hong Kong residents, this is naturally "showing off one's slight skill before an expert," but I think if it is seen by the general public who are unfamiliar with the place, it is exactly what they are looking for!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Hong Kong. The "buses" here are operated by the China Motor Bus Company, with a total of seven routes: Route 1 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Happy Valley Line, passing through Connaught Road, Murray Road, Queen's Road Central and East, Arsenal Street, Wan Chai Road, Morrison Hill Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 2 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Taikoo Dockyard Line, passing through Connaught Road, Murray Road, Queen's Road East, Arsenal Street, Lockhart Road, Percival Street, Hennessy Road, Causeway Bay Road, and King's Road. Route 3 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Hong Kong University Line, passing through Battery Street, Des Voeux Road Central, turning onto Garden Road, Caine Road, Bonham Road. Route 3A is the Yau Ma Tei to Mount Davis Line, passing through Battery Street, Des Voeux Road Central, turning onto Garden Road, Caine Road, Bonham Road, Pok Fu Lam Road, Mount Davis Road. Route 4 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Queen Mary Hospital Line, passing through Battery Street, Queen's Road Central and West, and reaching the entrance of the newly built Queen Mary Hospital on Pok Fu Lam Road. Route 5 is the Kennedy Town to Tai Hang Line, passing through Sands Street, Queen's Road West, Central, and East, turning from Wan Chai Gap Road, Morrison Hill Road, Leighton Road, Caroline Hill Road, and reaching Tai Hang Tung Lo Wan Road. Route 6 is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Stanley Line, passing through Battery Street, Queen's Road, and Queen's Road East, turning onto Stubbs Road, Repulse Bay Road, and Island Road. Route 6A is the Yau Ma Tei Ferry Pier to Repulse Bay Line. Route 7 is the Yau Ma Tei to Aberdeen Line, passing through Connaught Road Central and West, turning into Eastern Street, passing Queen's Road West, turning onto Pok Fu Lam Road, and Island Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 7A is the Aberdeen to Stanley Line, passing through Island Road, Repulse Bay, and other places. The above routes have already interwoven and connected the entire Hong Kong area. As long as you have money, you can go anywhere you want. As for whether you want to take the "bus," "tram," "cable car," "rickshaw," or "taxi," that's entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about Kowloon. The public transportation there is not as numerous as in Hong Kong. There are no trams, and there are no cable cars to climb the mountains. The most important ones are "buses" and "taxis," followed by rickshaws. The "taxis" there are divided into two sizes, the large ones are the same as in Hong Kong, and the small ones are limited to three passengers, but the fare is reduced to three corners per mile. This is probably for the economic considerations of passengers traveling alone or in groups of three. This is worth emulating by the "taxi" companies in Hong Kong. The buses running throughout the Kowloon and New Territories areas can be divided into the following routes - Route 1, Route 2, Route 2A, Route 3, Route 3A, Route 5, Route 6, Route 7, Route 8, Route 9, Route 10, Route 11, Route 13, Route 15, Route 17, Route 18, etc., a total of sixteen routes. The bus terminus is located at the Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan Road Ferry Pier. The areas through which each bus line passes are divided into Route 1, Tsim Sha Tsui to Sham Shui Po, passing along Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, and Lai Chi Kok Road, and reaching the terminus of Sham Shui Po. Route 2, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Lai Chi Kok, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, Castle Peak Road, and with Lai Chi Kok as the final point. Route 2A, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Yau Tsim Mong, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, and reaching Yau Tsim Mong. Route 3, starting from Tsim Sha Tsui, passing through Salisbury Road, Chatham Road, Wuhu Street, Tak Ku Street, Ma Tau Chung Road, Kung Lok Road, Prince Edward Road, Kowloon City, Sai Kung Road, and reaching Ngau Chi Wan as the final point. Route 3A, starting from Tsim Sha Tsui, passing through Salisbury Road, Chatham Road, Wuhu Street, Tak Ku Street, Ma Tau Wai Road, Kung Lok Road, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road, and reaching Kowloon City as the terminus. Route 5, from Tsim Sha Tsui to the Jordan Road Memorial Arch, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Carnarvon Road, Kimberley Road, Austin Road, Austin Crescent, and ending at Jordan Road. Route 6, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Tong Line, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 7, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Tong Line, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Waterloo Road. Route 8, from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Tong Line, passing through Salisbury Road, Nathan Road, Argyle Street, Waterloo Road. Route 9, from Jordan Road Pier to Yuen Long Line, passing through Jordan Road, Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, Castle Peak Road, and reaching Yuen Long Market in the New Territories. Route 10, from Jordan Road Pier to Ngau Chi Wan Line, passing through Jordan Road, Shanghai Street, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road. Route 11, from Kowloon City to Lai Chi Kok Line, passing through Sai Kung Road, Prince Edward Road, Ma Tau Wai Road, Tak Ku Street, Wuhu Street, Chatham Road, Gascoigne Road, Jordan Road and Pier, Shanghai Street, Lai Chi Kok Road, Yau Tsim Mong Street, Castle Peak Road, and reaching the terminus. Route 13, from Jordan Road Pier to Ngau Chi Wan Line, passing through Jordan Road, Nathan Road, Prince Edward Road, Sai Kung Road, and turning into Ngau Chi Wan. In addition, there are Route 15 from Yuen Long to Kam Tin Line, Route 17 from Yuen Long to Fanling Line, and Route 18 from Fanling to Sha Tau Kok Line. However, these three lines are already in the New Territories and are not within the scope of this article's discussion.</p>
<p>The "buses" running on the above lines are entirely operated by the Kowloon Motor Bus Company, which has a total of more than 130 vehicles of various sizes.</p>
<p>The land transportation is so perfect and complete. The sea transportation is also very satisfactory to us. Whether you are in Hong Kong or Kowloon, you can go to Tsim Sha Tsui or the United Pier, then the destination you need can be resolved immediately. The evolution of mankind is endless. Perhaps in the near future, Hong Kong and Kowloon will also have an aerial transportation network. (New)</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] The × troops invading Guangdong are sinking deeper and deeper, facing a dilemma. Recently, due to the smooth progress of our counteroffensive, they were forced to seek help from Tokyo. It is heard that × has increased the number of amphibious aircraft coming to Guangdong in multiple batches, carrying out crazy bombing everywhere, attempting to threaten the northern counteroffensive military. Today (7th), at 8:00 a.m., under slight rain, one × aircraft risked flying to Qingyuan, Yingde and other places for reconnaissance for two hours, and retreated without dropping bombs. Also, after × captured Jiangmen and Xinhui, they have not given up their plan to invade the west. They continue to increase troops from Jiujiang, advancing along the Jiangmen-Foshan road towards Shaping and Longkou, attempting to invade Yangmei on the border of Gaoming, and planning to capture Hecheng first. Because they were discovered by our local troops, they launched separate attacks. Longkou and Shaping were gained and lost several times. The × troops of Sanzhou, Zhu Liuhe also made no progress. In recent days, they have sent × aircraft to frantically bomb the border of Gaoming and Heshan, attempting to reduce our resistance forces. According to information here, Shaping has been tragically bombed by × for days, several times a day. More than a thousand shops in the entire market have been reduced to ruins. Currently, only more than forty dilapidated houses remain. More than ten thousand refugees have no homes to return to, and the situation is extremely miserable. On the 5th of this month, Longkou Market, Yangmei Market, and Sanzhou Market were all ravaged by × aircraft. More than a dozen bombs fell near the market in Longkou Market, and two bombs fell in the first market. Sanzhou Market and Yangmei Market are important transportation routes between Gaoming and Heshan. This is the third time they have been bombed, and the disaster is even more tragic. More than a hundred civilians were killed or injured. Gaoming City has been bombed seven times. Most residents in the city go out early and return late, and all shops open for business at 4:00 p.m. Although they have been bombed this time, there were not many civilian casualties, it is said.</p>
<p>It is also reported that our main force, led by Division Commander Zhang and commanded by Division Commander Chen of the Guangxi Army, advanced along the Xinhui-Heshan and Xinkai roads, launching a counteroffensive against Jiangmen and Xinhui, and has approached various places in Fozi'ao, Da Xiaomei, and Shatidiqiao. × has increased its troops by more than a thousand, rushing to the outer line for reinforcements to defend against our counteroffensive. In order to cope with our main force's counteroffensive and maintain the two strongholds of Jiangmen and Xinhui, partnering with the Shun Tak × army to gradually implement the so-called policy of pacification, on the evening of the 5th, the Jiangmen and Xinhui × chieftains held a military conference in the × Army Club on Changdi Road in Jiangmen, discussing strategies to defend against our main force's counteroffensive, and preparing to build defensive fortifications when street fighting occurs in an attempt to resist stubbornly. The meeting was presided over by the Jinmaru Regiment Commander of the × Wujiu Mountain Division, with the participation of the Branch Commander of the 8th Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kazuki, Team Leader Fujita, and the manager of the × Shang ×× Foreign Firm. In addition to actively deploying defenses against our counteroffensive, they are also preparing to implement enslavement education, it is said.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] A certain senior official from the Southwest arrived in Guangdong for inspection. According to the results of the inspection, there are many shortcomings in party affairs in Guangdong Province, which need to be improved urgently. As for politics, Chairman Li's firmness and decisiveness have led to a phenomenon of getting rid of the old and setting up the new, which is very optimistic.

<p>[Zhongshan Quick News] The × launched a large-scale invasion of Heshan, and successively captured Shaping, Hecheng and other places with a fierce momentum. For a time, the entire territory of Heshan was almost covered by ×. Later, our main force, together with local troops, advanced in separate columns and recovered the lost land in turn. Currently, except for a few remnant × troops on the Xinhui-Heshan Road, there are no × traces in the rest of Heshan. Ou Jian, the magistrate of Heshan County, specially moved the county government back to ×× and actively handled post-war affairs. According to a telephone call from Heshan on the 5th, Magistrate Ou of Heshan, considering that Shaping and Hecheng were tragically bombed by × aircraft, causing severe disasters, and that post-war disaster relief for refugees was urgent, specially summoned district chiefs in batches for talks, discussing the post-war work steps in various districts.

<h3 id="e49">A Meeting with Yang Qianji, Commander of the 7th Security Regiment, a Hero of the Bloody Battles in Jiangmen and Xinhui <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>(Minge Society Jiangmen and Xinhui Frontline Correspondence) I went to the front line of Jiangmen and Xinhui twice, but I regretted not being able to meet Yang Qianji, the commander of the 7th Security Regiment who was fighting hard. This time, I went to the front line again, waited all night, and waited another half day. Fortunately, I met our glorious Commander Yang.</p>
<p>After more than a month of hard fighting, more than a month of exposure to the sun and rain, more than a month of mental strain, Commander Yang in the reporter's imagination must be thin and tired. However, after meeting him, the facts proved that the reporter's speculation was completely wrong. Commander Yang was still that tall, fat man, and his upright and broad face glowed with a slight red light. His two big eyes were rolling around nimbly, without any fatigue.</p>
<p>After shaking hands, the reporter expressed his infinite respect to Commander Yang, who was fighting for the people and the country. Commander Yang immediately interrupted the reporter's words and said,</p>
<p>"There, just as the old saying goes, 'raising soldiers for a thousand days is for use at one time.' If soldiers don't fight, then why does the country waste national funds to raise soldiers?"</p>
<p>Very good, the reporter respectfully asked about the course of the Jiangmen and Xinhui battles. Commander Yang graciously showed the map and explained in detail, briefly as follows:</p>
<p>"Our regiment was ordered to leave for the front line of Jiangmen and Xinhui on March 30. On April 1, we were ordered to counterattack Jiangmen. Immediately, the first and second battalions were sent to deploy defenses in the area of Duhu, and contact was made with the new special task force. Several regiments were assigned to the right wing, and the new Shun Task Force was assigned to the left wing. At about 2:00 p.m. on the 2nd, the New Shun Special Task Force was broken through by the × people. I immediately sent two more battalions to take over. In the end, because the × people concentrated their firepower and attacked fiercely, they retreated to the area of Guifeng Mountain and Ma Mountain. In the afternoon, the × people again used aircraft to cover and launched a joint attack on our position with tank vehicles, artillery, cavalry and infantry units. In order to avoid heavy sacrifices, we fought hard until 4:00 p.m. and took advantage of the heavy rain to retreat to the area of Dawan Liantang."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, a service soldier came to report and called Commander Yang to answer the phone. About ten minutes later, Commander Yang continued,</p>
<p>"After the 3rd, our army fought in the area of Pingdi Ridge and Da Xiaomei Mountain. On the 18th, our two battalions attacked the × people from both sides and recovered the Duhu area. On the morning of the 19th, we began to counterattack Duhu City again. The 7th and 9th companies attacked and entered Hougang, capturing two × artillery pieces. Because the × army counterattacked from Jiangmen and our reinforcements failed to arrive in time, we hastily destroyed the two artillery pieces with hand grenades, captured a telescope, and safely retreated back to the original position. The × casualties in this battle were particularly heavy. An artillery team leader was killed in battle, and Xie Yifan, the battalion commander of our 3rd Battalion, was injured. On the same day, another part of our troops rushed into the North Gate of Xinhui, killing many × people. There was fierce fighting in the Xinhui area on the 19th, and I once again rushed into Xinhui. For the next few days from the 20th to the 23rd, the fighting in Xinhui was still in a stalemate. On the 22nd, Zhong Yushu, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion, was also injured. In the more than twenty days of fighting, the regiment suffered 178 injuries and nearly 100 deaths, including two or thirty officers."</p>
<p>The service soldier came to report again. After the report, the reporter asked,</p>
<p>"What are the estimated casualties of the ××?"</p>
<p>"About four hundred people," Commander Yang replied.</p>
<p>"What is the comparison between × and our forces?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"At first, the × people had only about two thousand people, but later they gradually increased to four or five thousand people. As for our army, the New Shun Special Task Force and our regiment were the first to participate in the battle. But the number of people in the New Shun was very small. After being dispersed by the × people in the battle on Gangzhou Road, they rarely appeared on the front line. The reinforcements that arrived successively were the 3rd Security Regiment and the 10th Security Regiment. In addition, several main force regiments also arrived at a certain place on the front line," Commander Yang replied.</p>
<p>"Commander Yang, what do you think of the × people's ambition to invade Jiangmen and Xinhui?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"In my personal opinion, the only ambition of the × people is to seize Danshui Port, attack the West River, and threaten Guangxi. But the West River is heavily guarded by our army, and there are extremely many water mines along the river. It is difficult for the × people to cross it."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Commander Yang handed a cigarette to the reporter. When the cigarette was lit, there was a moment of silence in the room. After a while, the reporter asked about the reasons why the counterattack on Xinhui could not be completed entirely. Commander Yang replied,</p>
<p>"Poor coordination between friendly forces is a major reason."</p>
<p>Following that, talking about the issue of cooperation between the military and civilians, Commander Yang said,</p>
<p>"The new people's movement work is not done well enough. Fighting in this area not only does not get the help of the people, but it is also difficult for our army. Also, there are especially many traitors here."</p>
<p>The service soldier came in again and handed a piece of paper to Commander Yang. After Commander Yang wrote a piece of paper, the reporter asked again,</p>
<p>"From this battle, how are the morale of our army and the × army?"</p>
<p>Commander Yang's reply was:</p>
<p>"Our officers and soldiers are brave in battle and regard death as home. The × are panic-stricken and extremely afraid of death in battle. There are many facts that can prove this. First, in combat, the × army retreats when our army charges twice. Also, there is a second more real example. Once, two brothers from the 8th Company ambushed in the Qizi Pit area and fought them, supported for three or four hours, repelled the × people, and returned safely. At that time, I saw it very clearly on the top of the mountain with a telescope. Later, each person was awarded three silver dollars." After a pause, the reporter asked,</p>
<p>"How is the supply for this battle?"</p>
<p>Commander Yang pondered for a moment and replied,</p>
<p>"The supply of food is not a big problem, but we still have two major difficulties at present. First, we lack medicine, so that soldiers who are injured have no medicine to apply, which increases a lot of suffering. Second, we can't buy rubber shoes with money. It is not good to walk without rubber shoes, which has a great impact on combat. We urgently need to solve this problem."</p>
<p>After finishing speaking, Commander Yang touched the pistol on his belt, loosened his belt, and asked the reporter with a smile,</p>
<p>"When will Mr. Lin return to Hong Kong?"</p>
<p>"I plan to go back in the next three or four days. What do you want to tell me?" the reporter replied.</p>
<p>"Nothing, but I hope that after you go back, you will appeal to the Hong Kong compatriots on my behalf that we are in urgent need of medicine and rubber shoes."</p>
<p>"Of course, this is my duty!"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the reporter asked Commander Yang to write an inscription as a souvenir. Commander Yang said,</p>
<p>"My calligraphy is not good. I'll give you a photo instead."</p>
<p>Commander Yang wrote the following two sentences on the bottom of the photo he gave to the old reporter:</p>
<p>"If I die, the country will live; if I live, the country will die."</p>
<p>Comparing Commander Yang in the Jiangmen and Xinhui War with this inscription, it truly shows that Commander Yang is a hero of the War of Resistance. On the 3rd of May, 28th year of the Republic of China, at a certain place on the Jiangmen and Xinhui front line</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Keighley are on their honeymoon trip. However, they have been married for nearly a year. They departed from Hollywood, and the first country they visited was Japan. They arrived in Yokohama by ship and then proceeded to Tokyo. Their stay there lasted only two full days before they returned to Shanghai by the same ship. Yesterday afternoon, after disembarking, they stayed at Room 401 of the International Hotel. The staff of Warner Brothers Pictures in Shanghai warmly welcomed them. In the early afternoon, they, along with a Chinese gentleman, Mr. Feng, visited the war ruins in Zhabei. Around 4 p.m., they returned to Nanjing Road to purchase some Chinese goods. At 5:30 p.m., they returned to their residence. By that time, over twenty Chinese and foreign reporters, whom he had scheduled to meet at 5 p.m., had been waiting for a long time. At 7 p.m., they attended a dinner hosted by Warner Brothers. At 8 p.m., they went backstage at the Golden Theatre to watch Zhang Eyun's makeup session. Then, they returned to the front of the stage to watch a performance of "Yanmen Pass." At 11 p.m., they visited the Paramount, and Casanova, all three dance halls. The Hollywood trip was canceled, and they rested after midnight. This morning at 6 a.m., they boarded a U.S. naval vessel to catch up with the Empress of Japan, bound for Hong Kong. There, they will switch to a plane for a tour of the inland. He did not reveal the destination, but it is likely Yunnan and Sichuan. They will stay for a maximum of one week and then proceed to Saigon and Singapore before heading to various European countries. They are expected to return to New York around the beginning of July. This is his itinerary. His stay in Shanghai was only twenty hours, a truly fleeting visit.</p>
<p>Impressions of Japan</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Keighley were surrounded by reporters! It was difficult to say a few words to him. We asked him about his general impressions of Japan, and he spoke cautiously, avoiding sensitive topics everywhere. He looked carefully at our faces and asked, "Are there any Japanese reporters here?" We answered, "No." He then said with relief, "When we met with the Japanese press for the first time in Tokyo, their first question was whether it was true that Hollywood stars boycotted Japanese silk stockings. I could only say that I was not very clear about that. I visited various film companies and found the equipment to be quite good. The costumes for historical dramas were beautiful, but the costumes for contemporary dramas were too poor, which I did not approve of. I don't want to say much else."</p>
<p>Visiting the War Ruins</p>
<p>Keighley had decided to visit the war ruins in Shanghai a long time ago, showing his great concern for the Sino-Japanese conflict. Yesterday, he spent three hours viewing the scorched earth remains of the resistance in Zhabei and Jiangwan. He did not express any specific feelings, but his tone conveyed pity, regret, and sympathy. In particular, when passing through a certain foreign concession, he felt very miserable seeing countless refugees being searched by the hideous faces of the invaders. He wanted to capture it on film but was strictly prohibited, which he deeply regretted.</p>
<p>Love for National Opera</p>
<p>Because his time was limited, we did not press him with many questions. We only asked three points: (1) Which of his past films was he most satisfied with? (2) What new films will he produce upon returning to the United States? (3) What are his views on Chinese cinema and drama? His answers were quite simple: (1) It does not depend on the nature of the film but on the quality of the script. I am more satisfied with "The Beggar Emperor" because both lead brothers were very good. (2) What film I will direct upon returning to the United States is yet to be determined. (3) I am very interested in Mei Lanfang's opera. I remember seeing his performances in the United States, and I felt that the music, costumes, and expressions were all very good. It is a pity that I don't understand it very well. This trip is too rushed, and I was unable to visit a Chinese film studio, which I regret. He also said that he used to know over forty Chinese characters, but now he only remembers "人" (person) and "田" (field). We laughed together, and after this, we shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Representative Works of Hollywood Movie Stars <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Deanna Durbin: Deanna Durbin has only made four films: "Three Smart Girls," "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "Mad About Music," and "That Certain Age." Among them, "One Hundred Men and a Girl" is the most perfect, as both the performance and content are vivid and meaningful. The music and singing, with Stokowski and Durbin, also have outstanding achievements. It is unknown how her fifth film, "Three Cheers for the Boys," will fare.</p>
<p>Baby LeRoy: Movie fans all know that since "The Milky Way," Baby LeRoy has not had any outstanding works. However, in terms of the overall achievement of his work, his debut, "A Son of the Stage," is even better than "The Milky Way."</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney: Mickey Rooney has a grand presence. Since "Captains Courageous," he has mostly starred in Hardy family films, including "You're Only Young Once," "Love Finds Andy Hardy," and others. "Love Is a Headache" is the third film in the Hardy series. Mickey's amazing talent, along with Shirley Temple, will be watched by movie fans worldwide. His most successful work is undoubtedly "Boys Town," which he starred in with Spencer Tracy not long ago. Hollywood cannot find a second child who can handle the role in this film.</p>
<p>Freddie Bartholomew: Freddie Bartholomew has acted in quite a few films, but the one that is firmly remembered by fans is "David Copperfield." In addition to discovering Tyrone Power, it is also the work that made this child star famous. Freddie's best work is undoubtedly "Little Lord Fauntleroy."</p>
<p>Shirley Temple: Shirley Temple has nearly twenty works. The most outstanding in terms of performance are "Little Miss Marker" and "Curly Top." Compared to the former, the latter is even better.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer: Norma Shearer is a first-class superstar. She makes one film a year. Any male star who can co-star with her considers it an unparalleled honor. Robert Taylor and Tyrone Power have both been selected once. In the general audience's impression, her most recent work, "Marie Antoinette," is the most tear-jerking.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo: Greta Garbo has also acted in many films, with "Camille" being the most touching.</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor: In the past, "Seventh Heaven" and "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" from the silent film era were considered Janet Gaynor's best films. However, recently, her collaboration with Frederic March in "A Star Is Born" is the only work that has restored her past reputation.</p>
<p>Bette Davis: "Jezebel" and "All About Eve" are both award-winning works for Bette Davis. If compared strictly in terms of acting, the latter is even better than the former. (To be continued)</p>

<p>"But Leanora, do you think I should give it up when I've achieved such success?"</p>
<p>Leanora stared, thinking that she bore full responsibility for this "success"! He saw Byle in the corner, shaking his head worriedly. Mrs. Byle said, "Leanora, you should know that from today onwards, Doris no longer belongs to you, but to America."</p>
<p>Leanora left the dressing room in shock and returned to his office. Meek saw him enter and handed him the phone, saying, "There's a call."</p>
<p>The call was from the beautiful Madame Cavalleri, though he didn't know that she was indeed a very famous singer. If he really needed an expert's opinion on his wife's singing, she would be happy to provide it. She had attended the concert and asked if he really needed it.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Public Baseball Game: Chinese Team Gets Off to a Bad Start, Chen Lunying Makes a Big Mistake, Losing 4-6; The Strength of the Minidianu Team is Equal to the Chinese, But Each Player's Hitting is Very Accurate <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The sun is lovely and also terrible. If you encounter it when its blazing heat is overwhelming, it will make anyone feel uncomfortable. It was just like yesterday when it showed its fiery face, shining on everyone and scorching the skin painfully. However, the leisure class did not take it to heart, only the general working masses who earn a living were troubled.</p>
<p>However, the general sports athletes are not afraid of the heat. Yesterday, among the ball games that were noteworthy, there was baseball and football. One by one, they were active under the umbrella-like friendly sun, devising and striving to win their victory. Many general fans also resisted the heat of the sun with their skin, standing or sitting in that uncovered place to watch, still not thinking it was bitter.</p>
<p>That baseball game started at 10:00 a.m., with last year's champion, China, playing against the Minidianu American sailors. These two teams are quite strong, and once they encounter each other to compete for the top spot, there will definitely be a fierce battle. Therefore, the "friends" of this sport all wanted to see what was going on and see who had the higher skills. The not-so-large viewing platform was packed with high-ranking guests, which was quite lively.</p>
<p>In the Chinese lineup, most were last year's champion figures, only missing Chen Dayao and Luo William, two famous generals, and replacing them with a few new players. Based on this, the strength is still abundant. Most spectators also thought that they would not lose to the Min team. Unexpectedly, the result of the competition was that they lost 4-6. They suffered an unfavorable start in their first expedition. Could it be that the prestige of last year's champion would disappear?</p>
<p>The biggest problem with China's loss was that in the second inning, while in the defensive group, Chen Lunying made a big mistake, which caused the promising situation to fall into a state of irretrievability. The hitting skills of each player also seemed less accurate than the American sailors. However, in this game, China scored seven hits, including one triple and two doubles, while the Min team only scored six hits and one single. In comparison, the so-called hitting was slightly worse than the Min team, but not entirely. In short, the blame for this defeat lies with Lunying.</p>
<p>Pitcher Huang Rongjun was the best performer in the whole game. When defending, he was able to control it properly. Every ball he threw caused the opponent's batter to swing and miss, resulting in nine strikeouts. Although there were also some walks, there were only two. It is a pity that these two walks were made in the second inning when things were difficult. Because of Lunying's big mistake, the team lost three points in a row in this inning, and the defeat was based on this. If fate is so, who can complain?</p>
<p>Rongjun's defensive advantages have been described above. When he attacked, he only batted three times, and all three times he got hits, one triple, one double, and one single. Such feats are truly commendable.</p>
<p>Catcher Lin Ye is most willing to use his brain. Every action reveals his intelligence. He also has agile steals. Therefore, although the battle was lost, it has nothing to do with the pitcher and catcher. In fact, these two were meritorious and without fault.</p>
<p>Lunying took first base. In the entire defense, except for the big mistake in the first inning, there were no other mistakes. However, he ran very slowly. Several times when he was the batter, the ball he hit was knocked out before he could run to first base. If he were more agile, he would not have been rejected three times. Surely at least once he could have reached a safe place.</p>
<p>Second baseman Hu Zhengqu's hitting was not calm enough, but his defense was quite meritorious. Third baseman Galahari is a Chinese expatriate who returned from Canada, so he uses this name. In terms of his skills, he is not very sophisticated, but only made one out, which cannot be taken as a definite conclusion. Let's see how he performs next week.</p>
<p>Shortstop Chen Fang has a good grasp of hitting skills, but has not improved in defense. Although he has arm strength and can throw the ball far, because the target is inaccurate, he made the mistake of a wild throw back to first base.</p>
<p>Left fielder Zhong Qiansen is a veteran with rich experience. He usually catches the ball well in the field, but who knows that in the sixth inning of yesterday's battle, he was deceived by the ball and went in the wrong direction. Not only did he not catch the ball, but he also allowed Elu to score a hit. It was truly unexpected. Center fielder Cai Bingfen also had a similar thing happen in the same inning, which can be said to be extremely coincidental. As for the two's hitting skills, Lao Cai is better, often using his rich experience to get to first base.</p>
<p>Right fielder Zheng Limen missed catching the ball once, but his hitting was quite good, without the disadvantage of striking out.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the hitting skills of the Chinese players are unquestionable, but they still need to work hard on defense. If they maintain it properly and reduce mistakes, I believe that one day they will have the possibility of defeating any team.</p>
<p>The Min team's pitcher, Lu Elu's skills, are really below Rongjun's, but the whole team's defense is tight, with second baseman Zha's being the best. First baseman Dejishili, because of his height and long arms, catches it with few leaks.</p>
<p>The competition process: In the first inning, the Chinese team was the defensive group and did not lose anything. When it was China's turn to be the offensive group, Chen Fang scored one point. At the beginning of the second inning, Rongjun failed to catch the ball, and first base was occupied. Then Rongjun threw two walks, so that all the bases had enemies. Unfortunately, Tali hit, and Lunying made a big mistake, so three people occupying the bases ran back, losing three points in a row. When it was China's turn, they did not gain anything. In the third inning, the Min team increased by one point. In the fourth inning, China relied on Rongjun's triple to return to position, returning a point of color. The fifth inning was a blank inning. In the sixth inning, the Min team scored three hits and gained two more points, while China relied on Rongjun's single to send Lin Ye back to position. In the seventh inning, China regained one point with a score of 1-0. The total score was 4-6, and China lost. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e55">Public Lawn Tennis Singles Finals: The Xu Brothers Quarrel, See Who Will Be the Leader Tonight <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The All-Hong Kong Open Lawn Tennis Singles Final will be held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club at 4:45 p.m. today. The opponents are Xu Nuopei and Xu Runpei. The two are brothers. This time they encounter each other to compete for the championship, and fans mostly expect that there will be no quarrel between them, or that they will have a spirit of courtesy. However, those who know say that the two will definitely not just play a "romantic ball." Because the older brother has enjoyed a great reputation for a long time, but the younger brother has not yet had a taste of success. Therefore, he cannot help but covet the singles championship. However, ambition and ability cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Whether the younger brother's ambition can reach a successful path today remains to be seen how their struggle will end.</p>
<p>It is still remembered that in last year's hard court tennis match, the two of them also got the right to the final like this time. Therefore, when it came to the championship battle, many people thought that the older brother would show mercy and give the younger brother a chance to ascend the throne. However, as a result of the final, the older brother was better in skill and finally won the championship, and did not use sentimental feelings.</p>
<p>This time, they have again jointly advanced to the position of competing for the championship, so even though they are brothers, it is predicted that there will be fierce competition. However, how much is the younger brother's skill still inferior to the older brother's? Based on this speculation, the older brother is more likely to win. However, the two's ball skills have reached a wonderful realm, so after the competition, there will definitely be many wonderful actions to satisfy the fans' eyes. (East Lang)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Repulse Bay Beach: Swimmers Can Still Set Up Tents <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The rumor that the government prohibits citizens from setting up private swimming sheds and tents on Repulse Bay is still rampant. The swimming season has now arrived, and this issue is of concern to people who like to swim in Repulse Bay. According to the Secretary of Public Works, Mr. Kirk, the government has not made this decision. Although the swimming season has already started on the 1st of this month, the beach committee has not yet completed its work. The last meeting may be held in a short period of time. According to well-informed sources, the committee will not make the construction of prohibiting the establishment of private swimming areas, because this decision will inevitably cause repercussions from all parties. However, it is believed that the construction site of Repulse Bay's current swimming sheds will be relocated this year.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Tonight's Basketball Court: Continuous Good Show, Four Strong Teams Meet: Starlight Island Meets South China, Bell Sounds Fights the East: The Question of Victory or Defeat, the Prospect of the Championship is Extremely Important <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>......[Our Newspaper Special] This year's men's basketball game has now entered the stage of intensive preparations. Tonight's order includes two games in Group A and one game in Group B. At 6:30, the Bell Sounds team in Group B will fight Huaxiong. At 7:30, the Starlight Island team in Group A will meet South China. At 8:30, the East team will fight the Bell Sounds team.</p>
<p>......After defeating the East team, the Starlight Island team has a great chance of winning the championship. Judging from the current situation, the only team that can compete with Starlight Island is South China. Therefore, the meeting of the two armies tonight is no less than a championship final. If Starlight Island can defeat South China, then the championship seat will be stable. If not, then the night will be long and dreamy. Who the championship belongs to will still have to be determined in the future. Therefore, this battle is related to the matter.</p>
<p>......In terms of the strength of both sides, Starlight Island has many generals, and they are all powerful members of last year's champion Youth Association team. They also have the advantage of location, and the connection is pure and skillful. Even the powerful East team was defeated by them last week. South China's fighting power is also very abundant. They have always emphasized connection in combat and are a team with wonderful strategies. Compared to Starlight Island, there is no distinction, but the bottom-line attack is not as fierce as Starlight Island's. Tonight, when the two heroes meet, and because the relationship between victory and defeat is important, they will inevitably fight hard with each other, so it is not possible to predict who will die.</p>
<p>......In the last game, the East team fought the Bell Sounds team. The strengths of both sides are also equal, and the importance of the question of victory or defeat is no less than that of the second game. Because the winner has great hope for the runner-up seat. For this reason, this battle must also be fierce.</p>
<p>......Although the East team was once defeated by Starlight Island, its strength is strong and well-known. However, the Bell Sounds team is also a strong team. Its previous victory over Starlight Island was its most proud masterpiece. Tonight, it will negotiate with the East team. Each wants to take the victory. The fierceness of the competition is expected, and it is difficult to predict who will win.</p>
<p>......In the Group B battle, the strengths of the two armies are equal, and there is also something to watch. However, Huaxiong's shooting is more accurate, and it is more certain to win.</p>
<p>......The Basketball Association believes that the four strong teams will meet tonight, and the audience will definitely be crowded. In order to maintain order, the tickets will be increased uniformly. The downstairs seats are one dollar, limited to 200 tickets. The upstairs is 50 cents, limited to 400 tickets. Except for the six teams of that night and the honorary certificates that can enjoy free visits, the remaining team members can purchase half tickets to enter the venue. (Upstairs is 20 cents, downstairs is 50 cents.) The lineups of the four strong teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Starlight Island: Zhong Ziqiang, Liang Guofeng, Pan Yaojun, Chen Shibin, Dai Fucheng, Li Peiyan, Li Peichi, Xin Zhongjian, Lu Zhenxuan, Li Shijie,</p>
<p>South China: Xiao Jiemin, Lu Enjing, Shi Zhenzhi, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xinqiu, Qian Jinghui,</p>
<p>Bell Sounds: Chen Ruzheng, Shen Ruiqing, Guo Zhihong, Zhang Rensheng, Li Hengfen, Su Bohui, Guan Yun, Fou Foqiang,</p>
<p>East: Diao Nianhua, Xu, Sun Shiqing, Huang Fen, Chen Zongqi, Luo Jiyan, Lao Xiong, Guo Neng,</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>In yesterday's three Group B games, Chenguang abandoned the game in the first game, and Lingying won without labor. In the second game, the International team defeated Guanlei by seventy-five to fifty-two. In the last game, Chunfeng defeated the Qing team by fifty-two to eight.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Yesterday's Football Exhibition Match Was Lackluster: Eastern Wins Against Australian League - Australian Team Lacked Coordination, Lost 2-1 <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The match between this year's football league runner-up, Eastern team, and the Australian League team took place as scheduled yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM at the Hong Kong stadium. Although the Australian team came with the confidence of defeating the Manila Inter-Port team and the Singapore Chinese team, intending to easily defeat Eastern, the runner-up's strength proved to be formidable, showcasing true skill. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of 1-0. The second half ended 1-1, resulting in an overall victory of 2-1 for Eastern.</p>
<p>The weather that day was sunny and warm, with lush green grass. Chen Lanfang performed the opening kick-off ceremony to signify the importance of the event. Football fans, considering it a noteworthy occasion, were eager to witness the match. Ladies attended, creating a market-like atmosphere, and ticket sales were quite impressive.</p>
<p>Ho Cho-sheng, the Chinese interpreter and player for the Australian team, was originally scheduled to come to Hong Kong with the team. However, due to a left leg injury sustained while representing the Hu Ke team in a friendly match against the British Navy last Wednesday afternoon, he was unable to participate. With its lineup incomplete, the Australian team negotiated with Eastern, requesting Jiang Shan-jing to play for the Australian team. Meanwhile, Zou Wenzhi, who was originally scheduled to assist Eastern, unfortunately suffered from a carbuncle and was unable to attend. Li Deqi's foot injury had just recovered, and although he played, he still felt discomfort while moving. Consequently, Zheng Yingquan was called upon to fill the left midfielder position, and Huang Wengui was hired as the left winger.</p>
<p>Reviewing the strengths of both sides during the match, Eastern proved to be superior. Han, Zeng Zhongyun, and Luo Weiquan all performed steadily, with a good midfield line. Although the forward line showed occasional flair, their coordination was extremely disjointed, especially Yu Qia Xing.</p>
<p>On the Australian side, apart from Shen Dushi replacing Ya Maipeng and Shan Jing replacing Zuo Sheng, all other players started as planned. Goalkeeper Jia Hualu's performance was average. Inside defender Luo Badu outperformed Shan Jing. Midfielder Ya Luoshu was the best, being a standout figure in the whole team. However, the left and right midfielders were weak, lacking cooperation with the forwards, and frequently making aimless passes. The two wings of the forward line were quite lively, and center forward Ji Lilu was also fierce and agile. However, all players lacked shooting skills, and their coordination was inferior, leading to defeat.</p>
<p>The match itself was uneventful and lacked intensity. Initially, the Australian team attacked quickly and aggressively, but their front line failed to respond effectively, often missing opportunities. Later, Eastern recognized the opponent's weaknesses and attacked strongly. Qi Xiang scored a goal, ending the first half.</p>
<p>The second half was also uneventful, with both sides exchanging attacks. There was much running around, but only messy play. Over ten minutes into the half, Yu Qia Xing scored a goal in front of the goal, breaking the deadlock. The Australian team, having lost again, launched a strong counterattack and eventually scored a goal by the center forward, ending the match with a score of 2-1. Eastern won against the visiting team. The teams were as follows:</p>
<p>(Eastern Team)</p>
<p>Liu Han, Luo Weiquan, Zeng Zhongyun, Zheng Yingquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shidu, Huang Wengui, Yu Qia Xing, Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>(Australian League Team)</p>
<p>Jia Hualu, Luo Badu, Jiang Shan-jing, Ke Tuohua, Ya Luoshu, Sousa, Xiao Luobi, Shen Dushi, Ji Lilu, Gao Lasu, Li Gu</p>

<h3 id="e62">On the Youth Self-Renewal Movement <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>The celebration of this great Youth Day by the student community throughout Hong Kong on "May 7th," and the launch of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement, is an epoch-making event, a battle song of all Hong Kong youth!</p>
<p>Perhaps, does the "self-renewal" of youth mean that youth have committed sins and must "repent"? No! Youth, a generation young and innocently pure, are inherently clean and bright. They possess vitality, passion, and ideals, and naturally, they also have shortcomings. No one is a god, and everyone has flaws, but there are no sins. The so-called "self-renewal" means discarding the old and establishing the new. The Self-Renewal Movement is a conscious movement of discarding the old and renewing the new. Therefore, we must first affirm that the Youth Self-Renewal Movement throughout Hong Kong is not a short-lived and unsustainable action following the tail of politics. The Youth Self-Renewal Movement should be regarded as a cultural movement throughout Hong Kong, responding to the new enlightenment movement in the motherland, and serving as an exchange for the new enlightenment movement.</p>
<p>The Youth Self-Renewal Movement, as the name suggests, is a self-renewal movement of youth from all levels of society, not only encompassing young students but also including the broader youth community outside of it. However, we cannot deny that it is proposed and led by young students themselves, acting as the mainstream of the movement.</p>
<p>Judging from its guiding principles, the content of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement naturally involves eliminating bad habits, overcoming backwardness, and striving for progress. This progressive action requires the self-awareness of youth, the arming of youth minds, and the enlightenment of youth thought, which can only be achieved through enlightened progress.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this process of resistance war and national reconstruction, all Hong Kong youth, in order to obtain the new life they deserve, develop their strength to advance the giant wheel of resistance war and national reconstruction, and prepare to serve as the true masters of a free and new China, should regard the Youth Self-Renewal Movement as an opportunity for ideological cleansing and enlightenment, which is the current priority!</p>
<p>Historians point out that the two major characteristics of the European Renaissance were: "the discovery of man" and "the discovery of the world." Now we demand: to know the world, to know ourselves.</p>
<p>The unfolding of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement is a manifestation of the increasing self-awareness of youth, a new endowment of the times, and it is inevitable rather than accidental. It should be a development with a future rather than a fleeting moment. During the resistance war, every youth in the motherland is watching and caring about the resistance war, and being educated and awakened under the flame of the resistance war!</p>
<p>To care about the motherland's resistance war is to understand the motherland, to understand the present of the motherland is to understand the past of the motherland, and from understanding the past and present of the motherland, to see clearly the future of the country. This is the ideological arming that youth should have. However, China is China of the world. The world is facing a struggle between two major camps and a contradiction between two major groups of people. The motherland's resistance war is also one of them. There are forces of light growing in the world, and there are also demons wreaking havoc, and all of these are interacting with the motherland. Therefore, to understand China, one must understand the world, and regard China as a part of the world. The times are moving and leaping forward rapidly. The progress of one second is dozens or hundreds of times faster than before. We should understand the world, grasp the times with reason, in order to keep up with the times, not fall behind, and move forward as the vanguard of the times!</p>
<p>Being able to understand the world allows one to understand oneself; being able to understand oneself even better allows one to understand the world, and to elevate and develop one's own strength. Youth, the youth of semi-colonial China, the youth of China in the struggle for freedom and liberation, must understand themselves. The youth of Hong Kong, apart from a progressive few, the Youth Self-Renewal Movement must renew youth, breaking free from all superstitions, ignorance, dogmatism, and the quagmire of blind obedience, returning to the pure self, recognizing the self, and seeing clearly the self's historical mission at present!</p>
<p>The Youth Self-Renewal Movement should be a continuous cultural movement, not a short-lived, superficial, or window-dressing movement.</p>
<p>The Youth Self-Renewal Movement should enable youth to know themselves and the world. Only with ideological reform and arming can they discard the old and renew the new. Only through ideological cleansing and enlightenment can they develop reason and overthrow all superstition, ignorance, dogmatism, and blind obedience - only such a Youth Self-Renewal Movement can enable the vitality of youth to be developed and become worthy of being the masters of the new China!</p>
<p>We hope that the leaders of the Youth Self-Renewal Movement will expand their work extensively and work together with the cultural community!</p>

<p>— Shu Luan</p>
<p>She looked at a corner of the room, muttering to herself. She fell into the garbage heap of the two, quick glory and pain, light and darkness. She chose one of them.</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>"Hell?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, expressing denial.</p>
<p>"Heaven?"</p>
<p>She silently acknowledged.</p>
<p>"Then stand on our side," and discard your father's side—"</p>
<p>Although she still had some reservations, after receiving her father's reply in the evening, she made a firm decision. Because her father's reply meant this: if he did not reduce the amount of money, he would not hesitate to sacrifice his daughter. In fact, her father's words may not have been resolute, and it seemed only to threaten Yu Wen and his comrades to reduce a portion of the loss. In her opinion, she was uneasy. She felt an unprecedented hatred for her father.</p>
<p>"Traitor... traitor, no wonder people all scold you like that! You deserve to be scolded... a traitor loves money, not his daughter!... You are not my father, I have no father -- the daughter of a traitor has no father!"</p>
<p>She repented of the past, why did she live in a disreputable family? Why was she implicated by her father, the traitor of the motherland, and caused others to hate and be unfortunate? Why did she realize so late until now? She thought, cried, she seemed to be growing up in tears forever.</p>
<p>Yu Wen was by her side, explaining her father's reply to her, telling her that her father would come to redeem her.</p>
<p>"I know my father loves money. What if he doesn't redeem me?" (59)</p>
<h3 id="e64">A Rainy Day Smile <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Kuangsha</p>
<p>The road was beaten into a mud dragon by water droplets, lying prostrate, crawling under the low eaves, extending to the end. The shadow of this reptile disappeared, revealing a wasteland - no, now it should be said to be a puddle. Some raised places have become small islands, on which are built houses mixed with broken bricks and broken pieces of wood. A moldy, humid smell, mixed with the stench from the gutter, makes it hard to believe that life can also reside here.</p>
<p>A somber and suffering face was pressed into the sound of rain, and a pair of hopeful eyes peeked out from the broken gaps. He looked at the blurred footprints on the muddy road, and he believed that his brother would run back from the muddy road.</p>
<p>If the weather were clear, he would also be a little hero. He could also roll around in the Suzhou River, scavenging for floating vegetable stalks and the like: climbing on the rafts to peel the bark off the trees, checking out tin cans in the trash cans, and secretly sneaking through the barbed wire to pick up coal cinders. The rain imprisoned his little soul. His father pulled a rickshaw, and his mother? Where did she go? It was said that she went to work, but she never came back. Anyway, as soon as he was born, his mother was gone, and she never comforted him or held him. He and his brother were a team, and he couldn't leave his brother.</p>
<p>I don't know how much water there is in the sky. The rain is falling non-stop, as if it's going to break the ground. The mud dragon is already lying in the water, and the puddle is slowly rising to the edge of the cave.</p>
<p>Rain, rain, rain, mixed with the heavy sound of trucks, rumbled past outside the barbed wire, carrying tall cargo, like a majestic beast, splashing the mud high.</p>
<p>He remembered these things very clearly: his brother had the ability to chase after the trucks and quickly poke a hole in the large burlap bags loaded on the truck, and quickly pull out a pile of cotton. The workers on the truck gave him a thumbs up and praised him:</p>
<p>"Good kid."</p>
<p>A pile of cotton sells for one cent in the small shop. If he has the chance, he can also earn a few cents.</p>
<p>The police came. His brother was whipped, and the cotton that he had earned with his life was confiscated.</p>
<p>"Brother, when we grow up, we will also become police officers."</p>
<p>"No!" his brother was a little angry, "Who cares? We want to do something else."</p>
<p>"We'll pull rickshaws, like Dad."</p>
<p>"I don't like it - I want to be a road construction worker and build all the muddy roads."</p>
<p>"Brother, I'll go too. We'll build all the roads, and we'll build this muddy dragon road especially well, as smooth as if it were paved, so we can walk on it easily."</p>
<p>Bare feet stepped on the mud dragon, leaving a mark. This footprint was deep, powerful, and rapidly expanding.</p>
<p>"Brother, brother, you're back!"</p>
<p>Raindrops hit his sparse hair.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Embezzlement, Occupation, Theft and Others <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>In an unsound social system, the畸形phenomena that arise must have their objective factors. In other words, a person's wrongdoing is not innate. The growth of all sins is based on the deformed inducement in the real society. In a city where good and bad are mixed, people who generally lack the power of reason to control themselves are often confused by certain things, and take certain balls and objects as objects to realize their desires or entrust their emotions, so that they produce irreversible evil consequences. This is an undeniable general reality.</p>
<p>Shanghai City was originally a source of sin. Using cunning and deceptive methods to obtain material things is everywhere. The number of gambling dens that have moved to western Shanghai, and the impact they have on people with weak wills, have deepened the speed at which Shanghai creates sins, which really makes people shiver.</p>
<p>In recent months, when opening the social news section of newspapers, there have been daily reports of embezzlement, occupation, theft, and other consequences that occurred due to entering gambling dens, especially among salaried classes.</p>
<p>These salaried classes enter gambling dens. Besides a portion of gamblers who overestimate themselves, I think they must have a fluke mentality. In the present time of rising prices, the lifestyle of salaried classes is naturally quite poor. To expect to increase the enjoyment of material things is equivalent to 'drawing a cake to satisfy hunger.' Therefore, they open up other paths, hoping to enrich their lives with the acquisition of windfall wealth, and enter gambling dens. Unfortunately, the tragic consequences are simply blurred and vanish without a trace in their minds.</p>
<p>However, after entering the gambling den, no power can stop the growth and spread of sin, and no method can avoid producing evil results. They take their small salary income and go in, but not only do they have no hope of winning money by luck, they don't even have enough to stake. As soon as they lose, they are wiped out. Therefore, they want to recover their losses after losing, but the capital for doubling the bets is bound to be lost. Again and again, and again, they sink deeper and deeper. All the money they rely on to live is exhausted, and their lives cannot stop without food and clothing. Under such heavy pressure, distorted thoughts and actions are bound to arise as a result. Not long ago, there were reports in the newspapers that a bank clerk's embezzlement was discovered, a shop assistant's occupation was discovered, an accountant's deficit was a certain amount, and even wives and daughters' jewelry and clothing were pawned and damaged, and there were endless quarrels. Recently, it was also reported that a partner of a silk shop stole a number of rolls of silk and was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The roots of these phenomena are all the same, because of reporting to gambling dens. Some even use this money to gamble: as a result, they have tasted the flavor of iron windows, caused harm to their wives and children, and harmed society. The power of gambling dens is truly terrible!</p>
<p>This is still a visible fact. Other facts that have not been announced by the newspapers are even more numerous. The number is several times more than those sentenced to several years or several months of imprisonment, right? This kind of social evil is partly due to the畸形social system, and partly due to the general lack of determination, the inability to dominate themselves, knowing that there will be no good results, but still 甘不韙try. What's more, this kind of gambling den is still cultivated under the enemy's forces! For the sake of the present, it would be good to fundamentally eradicate this gambling family that kills people without using a knife. Secondly, I also hope that people will be vigilant and not be too obsessed. At the same time, I hope that employers will pay full attention to the poverty-stricken lives and actions of their employees, so that they can prevent problems before they occur, and not try to remedy them after the event, which is a win-win method. If embezzlement, occupation, theft, etc. are caused by entering and exiting gambling races, and they are clamoring in society, the personal personality and reputation will be bankrupt, and the employer's side will also inevitably expose the shortcomings of imprecise management and unsound internal organization.</p>
