<p>社評</p>
<h3>武裝和平與世界聯邦</h3>
<p>昨夜英首相張伯倫向國民籲請擁護政府以武裝求和平的政策。另一方面，紐約傳來的消息，美國著名國際問題專家史特萊頃間出版一本新書，陳述世界民主國家有組織聯邦的必要，史氏認爲「惟有民主國家迅速聯合，方能維持世界的秩序與幸福」。張伯倫和史特萊的目的是一樣的在於維持世界和平，但其手段則略爲不同。</p>
<p>張伯倫力言：「今日的世界，軍備堆如山積，其勢自難免引起憂慮，甚而引起事變；偶一不愼，大戰便會爆發。」他更謂：「倘戰爭果至爆發的時候，世界任何角落，都不能逃避戰爭的影響」。這是符合實際的認識。然而爲着阻止這種危機爆發所應採取的手段，張伯倫則謂：「惟英國必藉武裝始能保障本國的權利與自由，而避免他人迅速的襲擊」。英國的國策在以武裝求和平，我們在原則上自無可異議。但是今日的世界鬥爭是集團的鬥爭，七八年來世界上破瓖和平的侵略國家，已經儼然形成了國際的集團，其刧掠與侵奪也都彼此互相呼應，狼狽爲奸。惟其他們的行動是集團的行動，德意纔能够視歐洲最强國家的英法若無睹，恣意橫行於歐洲各地，甚而侵及於菲洲。東方的日本敢於「吞炸彈」，由我東四省侵入華北，由華北而華中，而華南，現在又以佔領海南島造成了太平洋上的「九一八事變」，根本原因也就是在於這個集團的侵略。原爲世界政治决定者的英美法蘇各大國，對這些侵略國家七八年來的橫衝直撞瞠然不知所措，根本原因在於被侵擾的民主國家不能以集團的力量抵制侵略集團。</p>
<p>張氏「以武裝求和平」的國策，固然是沒有錯誤，但是只有英國一國的武裝，卽英國一國單獨的行動，還是不能够求得和平。「九一八事變」當時，因爲英國不能和美國合作以制裁日本，遂致大陸均勢的破壞演至今日的地步，而太平洋均勢的破壤又已開始。德意日的軍事會議又正在柏林舉行，日本主張進攻蘇聯，德意則強調同時進攻英美法。這樣一來，英美法蘇等民主國家欲阻止侵略者的狂暴，就只有一條路：切實聯結迅速加侵略者以集團的壓迫。因此，史氏建議：「如欲解决世界問題，各民主國家關於外交事件，應在共同統制下聯合一致」；並謂：「現時，世界的十五民主國家應組織一大聯邦」。世界十五民主國家組織一大聯邦，在目前或者過於理想，但最低限度，英美法蘇四大民主國在對抗侵略者之點應該急速聯結起來，行動起來。最根本的關鍵在於英國是否深刻感到這四大國密切聯結的必要，及有無共同行動的誠意，英國方面只是再三申言『英法的聯繫』，至其與美蘇的具體聯結辦法，則少提到。</p>
<p>現在且就美蘇對於侵略者的態度略加檢討。美蘇過去對侵略者所表示的强硬態度姑且不談，只就最近的事實看，英國聯結美蘇的事機算是相當成熱了。在美國方面已是上下皆戚到極大的威脅：「美國隨時在太平洋上有被日本進攻的可能，此時美國將與日德意三獨裁國家對壘。』（共和黨議員摩特昨日在衆議院的演說）；另一個議員馬士也向國會提出警告謂：「讓步政策一旦採行，則將無止境，可退讓一寸，則一哩也可退讓。」二十二日美駐法大使貝立特也言：「美國地理上之孤立已成過去，現美國正從事整軍，致力保衛民主陣綫。」美國的民意多已不滿意孤立政策，積極支持民主陣綫自不成問題。</p>
<p>其次，蘇聯的態度更不消說了。日本最近藉口於漁約糾紛，再三再四向蘇聯大肆恐嚇，但是蘇聯始終不爲所動。昨日日駐蘇大使東鄉再度往晤李維諾夫，談判漁約問題，歷二時之久，東鄉竟以東京訓令威脅蘇聯，謂：「日本政府决定採取任何必要步驟，以保護日人在蘇聯領海捕魚。」但是李維諾夫却答以：「倘日政府果如日方報上所刊登的消息以日艦從事捕魚，則糾紛自難避免，所引起之嚴重結果或將超出地方事件範圍之外。」其對侵略者態度之凛烈與堅决，活躍紙上，蘇聯自然情願和英美法合作以制裁侵略者。</p>
<p>；英國應該迅速「以眞正的武裝求眞正的和平」！</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年二月十八日至廿四日</p>
<p>二月中旬和下旬這兩個星期中間，經過一個舊曆新年。關於這一期間的世界和中國的時事演變，我們會於前日刊出『春節中的世界動態』一文，列舉春節七天中的大事，以報告於讀者。現在把這兩個星期尤其是後一星期發生的時事，除已於上舉一文中述及以外，再作一個簡略的報告：</p>
<p>全面抗戰　大局穩定</p>
<p>兩星期來，我國全面抗戰形勢，仍極穩定。華南×軍突於本月十日在海南島登陸以後，雖然繼續增援，企圖佔領全島，</p>
<p>但是實力究屬有眼，兵力仍感不足，經我軍民英勇抗戰，現仍被阻於沿海各地，據廿三日電訊，×軍迄今傷亡近萬，巳達登陸實力的四分之一。如果我們能够對於島上抗戰軍民迅予切實接濟，則縱不能迅即驅盡××，亦可以盡其牽制大部×兵的作用，有助於全面抗戰形勢的發展。廣東西江北江方面我軍，兩星期來巳由與×對峙積極轉取反攻形勢，東江方面亦能繼續膠着大量×軍，因此華南×軍新進攻計劃便無法實現。華北方面，×軍一面繼續向晋豫增援，企圖集中力量渡河西犯，一面加緊進攻各游擊區，企圖掃除西犯後路的危險，因此兩週來晉南魯北黃河兩岸，戰况激烈，而察冀魯東晉北各地，亦有慘烈戰事。不過因爲我軍正面阻截得勝，黃河全綫屹然，×後戰鬥進展，綏察各路報捷，使華北×軍所謂新春大進攻不獲展開。華中方面長江以北兩軍繼續將時，長江以南因我軍反攻岳陽武昌及修水以北各地，使×軍分由浙東贛北截斷浙贛湘川通路的計劃無從實現。</p>
<p>我新空軍　偉大勝利</p>
<p>我國新空軍，最近兩週來在全國各戰區先後助戰立功。長江×艦及黃河以北×陣，遭受損失尤爲重大。二月寸五日長沙上空激戰，我軍擊落×機七架。二十日蘭州上空激戰，又擊落×重轟炸機九架，連油彈在內，每架約價美金百萬元，連空中勤務人員的教育訓練費用在內，總損失巳在一千萬元以上。而查明死亡×軍空中勤務人員，巳達二十三人，對於×空軍損失，自史慘重。二十三日，復有×機二十三架侵擾蘭州，我新空軍英勇抵抗，又擊落×機六架，我軍毫無損失。二期抗戰以來我國新空軍此種偉大成功，第一是由於我國政府積極建設新空軍的國策，第二是由於英美等友邦政府及人民之自動援助，第三是蘇聯助我在西北建設無敵的空軍根據地，此次×軍西犯蘭州失敗，二面可以顯出西北防衛的鞏固，一面亦可以顯出中蘇兩大民族親密合作所給日本侵略者的第一個重大打擊。</p>
<p>政治外交　長足進步</p>
<p>在抗戰新階段轉換時期舉行的六中全會和五中全會，曾經明白表現出中國兩大政黨對於在三民主義建國這個共同原則下爭取抗戰勝利的共同方針，表現出兩大政黨團結各黨領導民衆改進政治完成抗戰建國大業的共同方針，本月十二日至廿一日的國民參政會第三次大會，更表現了全國人民擁護團結</p>
<p>堅持抗戰的共同要求。這次大會在最高領袖蔣中正先生領導之下，通過了有關軍事國防經濟財政內政外交敎育文化的重要議案達八十八件之多，關於這次大會的重大收獲！本報前日已在『春節中世界動態』一文中有所報吿。特別値得注意的是擁護抗戰國策案，擁護蔣委員長嚴斥近衛聲明，實際上表現了全中國人民對于×人漢奸親日反共主和份子及其主張的痛惡！表現了全中國人民對於政府對于領袖對於國共兩黨的發展及各抗×黨派親密合作堅持抗戰的熱烈擁護。此外如關於修改兵役法案，改良司法案，國民精神總動員案，及組織特種委員會等的决議，都是適應抗戰建國新階段所需要的重要决議，而蔣委員長在其開幕詞與閉會詞中，更特別提示「本會的歷史使侖是要充實三民中義政治基礎，尤其是建立永久的眞正的民主政洽基礎，在中國政治制度史上占得很重要的光榮的地位。」隨着我國政治進步，及日×在遠東的新的冒險，外交形勢亦愈趨於我有利，蘇聯援華運動固然正在積極開展，英國政府亦在考慮進一步援華，廿二日英外次巴特拉並在下院提出報吿，大約英國家銀行將准英國商行出口信用貸欵額增至七千五百萬鎊，並另撥一千萬鎊與商行辦理「開拓事業」。</p>
<p>日本改變　冒險戰畧</p>
<p>日本侵略者在中國的軍事行動旣然遭受嚴重的阻力，兵力的分散與不足及其國內經濟困難人民反戰的危機，更阻滯其新的進攻計劃，於是一日×轉變對華戰略」的聲浪便傳遍各地日本侵略者的新戰略，是由側重西北的攻略轉向於側重西南，同時也是實際上鑒於我國西北防銜鞏固與蘇聯遠東軍備强大而使日×改取首先進攻西南威脅英法的戰略。於是而有佔領梅南島的攻略，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，於是而又有奪取上海租界的攻略！這種攻略的終極目的，自然是促進所謂「日「滿」支集團」及「東亞新秩序』的實現，而目前則在於配合意德在歐洲準備新攻略的形勢，在遠東威食英法，第一步要英法斷絕中緬中越的交通運輸，截斷中國從西南部取得外援，第二步要英法壓迫我國興×議和投降。</p>
<p>英法美國　團結問題</p>
<p>日本侵略者與意德侵略者分在東方西方展開新的攻勢　　　　　新形勢，提高並擴大了英法兩國革命政黨前進人士反對政府妥協運動的怒潮，同時也就迫得英法統治者不得不憬悟其妥協政策前途的危機。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，已使英政府不得不考慮其較强硬的態度，於抗議日軍佔領海南島之後，對於日機轟炸英界羅湖慘劇，亦巳明白宣佈英政府不惜採取斷然行動以應付非法暴行的决意。而兩區　　法兩國對於海南島事件的密切注意，廿一日英政府增加八萬萬鎊國防公債案的通過，廿二日在法總理『法國政策與美相同，法國寸土不能割讓』的宣言以及英法合作的愈趨緊密，英荷聯防侵略的協商，足見英法兩國已有聯合抵抗侵略的傾向。不過這種傾向不够堅定，還待運用兩國反法西斯反侵略的人民陣綫去鞏固它發展它。至於美國，羅斯福總統於十八日宣示反對法西斯侵略，號召愛護民主與和平的勢力聯合起來，美國名記者史特列特氏著書「今日之聯邦』建議組織民主國家聯邦解决世界問題，引起全美人士的注意與擁護。又據美國民意協會廿二日報吿，該會最近投票測驗民意結果，大多數贊成美國放棄孤立政策，贊成『倘德意進攻英法，美國應盡一切可能以援助英法。」由此可見全美人士對於反法西斯侵略政策的熱烈擁護，胡佛等反對派勢力終將失敗。而美衆院於十五日通過新國防案，更可瞪明羅斯福所行政策，巳經獲得最大多數的擁護。</p>
<p>蘇聯內外　威信提高</p>
<p>這裏還要特提出報吿的，是社會主義國家蘇聯在國內及國際成信，正在一天超過一天的增高着。蘇聯與立陶宛的新商約巳經成立，而調整蘇聯波蘭經濟關係的各種協定，經數星期的磋商，亦已於本月十九日在莫斯科簽字。此專足以表現蘇聯外交政策新的成功，使波蘭從德國侵略者的魔手中脫雕漸漸成爲和平勢力的羽翼。此外蘇聯與黑海沿海各國的關係，亦在進行協調，蘇英新商協約巳在開始進行蘇聯向美購艦談判，亦將積極進行。第三個五年計劃開始，蘇聯在國際的地位更加增高了。這自然是民主和平陣綫的樂觀現像。至於蘇聯援華運動，表現在我國西北國防的强化，我國新空軍的長成，及表現在日蘇漁約談判停頓表現在蘇日在蘇僞邊境與蘇日海上衝突形勢產重等事，實很明顯。本月廿三日全聯邦熱烈慶祝紅軍成立廿一年紀念，並向全世界宣示全聯邦紅軍及工農大衆誓死保衛社會主義祖國與反法西斯侵略的决心。此外，聯共十八屆大會將在三月十日召集，對於發展和平陣線力量消滅法西斯侵略集團勢力，自將有更重大的决定與力量表現出來。我們對於中華民族解放鬥爭和全世界反法西斯反侵略鬥爭，應該以更大的勇氣與毅力，積極參加，堅决奮鬥我們一定要勝利，我們一定能够勝利—</p>
<h3>我國經濟動員中之工業合作【續昨】</h3>
<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>小工廠組織不繁，當局意見易趨一致，行動便捷，四也。小工廠地點選擇，比較自由，可得就地取材及就地銷售之利，五也。故小工廠雖亦有其缺點，而仍可有其存在之力量。且如能以合作方式經營，則尙可有合作社聯合社之組織，使其可兼有大工廠與小工廠之利而無其弊，此其三。我國物產豐富，幅員廣大，而交通不便，故土法小工業幾於無地無之。我國工業之發展，决不致使此類小工業及家庭工業完全歸於淘汰。然吾人確非積極改良此類小工業及家庭工業之生產組織與製造技術不可，則工業合作自卽爲最適當之途徑，此其四。＼</p>
<p>復次，從農村方面觀察，我國今日旣尙屬一農業國家，則經濟政策自必以繁榮農村爲主。但欲求農村之繁榮，卽非發展農村副業不可，此卽可應用合作方式以經營之者。我國農民收入，年僅數十元。如無副業收人，則雖値豐年，亦尙不足以應仰事俯畜之需求，故副業實爲我國農民補充收入之主要來源，此其一。加以農業爲季節性之生產，必有相當始足使農間勞動及時間有所利用，此共二。如再從農業經營之經濟而言，農產品如能於加工之後再爲運銷。不但價値可以提高。抑亦較易保存，此其三。農業經營勢必逐漸趨於集體，則農業上之剩餘勞動，自必預爲之地，鄉村副業之發展，即具有吸收此剩餘勞動之効力，此其四。而且工業有啓發思想之力量，如能使工業逐漸散佈於鄉村，則鄉民墨守舊法之度，態必能迅速轉變，而科學思想亦即可深入於民間矣，此其五：</p>
<p>以上各端，尙係指一般情形而言。當此戰時自更覺工業合作之重要。戰前我國工業大都集中於沿海各省，故自抗戰以來，我民族工業之僅有的微弱基礎。巳被暴×摧殘無餘。挽救之這，如政府過去之將前方各廠於可能範圍內，儘量遷入後方，固不失爲一辦法，但此時後方各大都市亦每遭×機狂炸，如無防空設備恐仍不免毀壞，故凡非必須集中製造之工業，應使散布於鄉間。此項工廠規模旣不致甚大，應可採行合作方式。且戰時工業，爲使勞資精神團結，尤非採用合作組織不可。然此類工廠之善後，尙非工業合作之急務；且卽能應用合作組織，改善此類工廠之經營，亦不足以抵補前方工業之損失，必能以合作力量改善全國各地原有小工業及家庭工業之組織與技術，並從而創造之，則其有補於戰時工業之生產，確非淺鮮。我國今日戰區內之工業原料，及工業勞動，欲求其能仍爲我方利用，恐亦非組織戰區鄉村工業合作不爲功。</p>
<p>凡此所述，皆爲我國亟應推進工業台作之理由。我國今日推進工業合作之專門機關爲中國工業合作協會。該會實際上係由行政院撥款成立。惟因去年七月間最初發起時係由西人艾黎主持，且有請求他國接濟資金之計劃，故以協會爲名。該會現分西南西北東南中南川康等數區分別推進，已略有成效，惟距理想尙遠。不佞因有鑒於此項任務之重大，工作之艱鉅，特冉就管見所及，略述其應加注意各點於後。</p>
<p>一曰，工業合作協會之本身機構應力求其健全也。該會事業範圍，遍及全國，甚至戰區及邊遠省分亦均在其範圍之內，故本身機構如不健全，則不但不能積極推動各區事業之進行，即欲消極的對各區事業加以監督，亦將有所不能。余嘗細察該會事業之性質，以爲第一應使其職權之能相當集中，以便利一切職權之行使，蓋戰時行動必須特別求其迅速，如負責者事事須受他人牽制，則欲其有所成就難矣。但同時各區辦事處之工作，又非使其能相當的自主不可，因各區辦事處環境不同，必須隨機應付，方能有所收穫，如必事事請示總會，則進行必感困難。故該會行政機構，必須於集權分工之間，妥定購法，使其旣不失之散漫，又能免於拘束，則工作效率必可提高，此其一。</p>
<p>二曰，工業合作與一般合作行政之關係應力求其調整也。夫工業合作之重要旣如上述，今又得有一全國性之協會從事推動，負責投資，各省合作主管機關。必歡迎之不暇，决無拒絕推動之理。但因彼此皆可推動此項之合作，各省之所謂農村合作委員會乃一習慣用之名詞，其工作並不一定限于農村，且農村中之工業合作，協會方面亦正欲加以推動，何况各省之合作主管機關亦有屬於建設廳者，故雙方職樣上之混亂，爲事實所不可免。加以工業合作旣亦為合作社之一種，則其將與其他合作組織，共同受合作社法之約束，自無疑間，而各省之合作主管機關，又即爲合作社法之執行機關。竊以爲各省合作主管機關不宜嚴格以合作法相繩，致工業合作之推進，發生種種之障礙，因我國合作社法大體以農村合作社爲對象，且側重於農村信用合作社之需要，其他有關規專亦無不如是，在平時已未必能完全適用於工業合作社。自戰事發生以後，情形更大不相同。故此時工業合作社之法律根據，應暫時放鬆，求其能不違反合作之精神可矣。至於指導方面，工業合作協會似應於各地設立協進會，請各地合作行政人員參加指導工作，或由協會區辦事處及辦事分處吸收各地原有合作行政人員兼任協會方面職務，如是則　事人旣已聯繫，工作自可調整矣。此其二。</p>
<p>三曰，工業合作應使其能名實相符也。蓋吾人提倡工業合作，意在欲以合作方式促進工業生產，而非僅工業生產之促進，故對於工人及投資者之合作精神，必須切實培養，務使此項工廠確能較普通工廠爲有意義，並須使勞資雙方之關係確能根本改善而後已，否則徒擁合作之美名而無合作之精神，不但無補於合作運動之改進，且反足淆惑社會之聽聞，殊屬不妥，况工業合作之方式甚多，作其合化之程度各不相同。故若謂此時我國不易組織嚴格的正式的工業合作社，亦殊不乏變通適應之道，總以使且能充分表現合作化之精神爲原則，此其三。</p>
<p>四曰，工業合作之幹部必須着手訓練也。此項訓練可分合作人員及工業人員辦理之。工業合作運動爲一全國性之運動，其所需幹部人才自必甚多，雖其中有一部分工作可委託原有工作人員辦理，但恐仍非大量補充不可。且我國過去之合作訓練，對工業工作甚少注意。合作學院雖曾專設工業台作科目，並尙有工商管理等補允課程，然受訓人數無多，且亦非可全部　用。故此項幹部訓練實屬必不可少。在合作指導人員較多省份如能與省合作主管機關接洽分期抽調各縣合作指導人員加以工業合作及工業常識之訓練，實爲一舉兩得之辦法，至工業人員之訓練，則應指定若干不同工業之中心工廠爲訓練地點，招收工人，切實訓練，使受訓者得於技術訓練及合作訓練以外復能有實習之機會。此其四。</p>
<p>五日，工業合作之經營，必須力求其經濟也，我國已往各合作社之經營，多尙未能達於經濟之境地，此爲一極大憾事。夫吾人之所以提倡合作組織，並非僅欲合作社單位之增加，而在使合作組織確能使事業之經營確能較未經組織合作社以前爲經濟，雖吾人所謂絆濟，不一定能以金錢之數字相衡量，但至少須使其能在相當情形之下有健全發展之把握而後可。故當工業合作社創立以前，關於某種工業之資本廠址勞動機械技術原料市場運輸及社員成分，均應加以精密之考察與計劃，如其多組織而不健全，不如少組織而力求其完善。蓋工業合作之發展，係民族工業之基礎工作，應求其能繼續滋長，垂之久遠，切不可速組速放，以表示協會工作之迅速，因他日合作社如一一失敗，其責任亦將由合作社負之，協會工作社之緊張與否，可從多方面觀察，固不在合作數量之一端已也，此其行。</p>
<p>六曰，工業合作之發展，應有整個計劃，以資助據也。以區域之劃分言，現在固已分爲　區進行，但事實上因交通及政治等關係，每區範圍實尙嫌太廣，黔滇似可自成一區，或即以一省爲一區亦無不可，區以內之中心地點，亦應妥爲繼劃，使於原料機械原動市場運輸等各端均能適合方是，以事業言，究竟從種何工業着手，始能針對抗戰建國之需要，此亦爲問題。最後尙有一組織步驟之問題，究竟注重創設新業，抑應將舊有工業改組爲合作社，或應將若干小工業以合作方式使其合併，亦頗値得研究。如漫無預定計劃，則幾於處處皆可組織合作社，業業皆可組織合作社，勢必感覺頭緒紛繁，無從着手，卽勉强着手矣，亦必感覺人力財力之多所浪費。以我國人才資金之缺乏，必使點滴力量均能以最經濟之方法使用之。此卽非懝定計劃，把這事實，分別輕重緩急，循序漸進不可，當此戰時，一切秩序比較紛亂，，欲求計劃之如何精密，固不可能，然有此計劃作爲進行方針，再隨時隨地相機補充原有計劃之所不及，亦未爲晚。所貴乎有計劃者，僅欲賴以確定具體方針而已。然計劃之草擬，必以事實爲依據，故調查工作，亦屬必不少。可此時欲派員赴各地詳細調查，恐爲時間及經費所不能容許，但不妨選定若干中心地點作爲調查籠圍，其餘各地，委託當地政府代爲調查可也。現在國各縣，無不設有指導員，如能善爲利用，廣爲徵求，再就其較有價値者，派遣專員實地考祭，所費不大而收效甚宏，似不妨一試辦之，此其六。</p>

<h3>防止偽造法幣　全國財政會議將商辦法　×偽幣大量流入淪陷區</h3>
<p>【本報特訊】最近日本于濫發軍用票及華北『聯銀』之僞鈔外，竟僞造我國法幣，嗾使漢好及日韓浪人混用，企圖破壞法幣信用，國人對于日方此種陰謀，都極注目，記者爲明瞭政府對此種僞造「法幣」的防止辦法，和經濟界的意見，特走訪某銀行家，徵詢一切。</p>
<p>據銀行家的意見，認爲日本國內經濟的貧弱，巳顯明而易見，本年度且有陷於崩潰的危險。日本迭次利用佔領區內施行種種經濟陰謀，企圓對本國的貧乏有所補救，但結果終不能實現。據所知者，在淪陷區中，日僞鈔和不兌現的軍用票的流入，截至最近止，約達二千五百萬至三千萬日元，該批日鈔是用以大量收買食糧棉花等農產品，企圖用日圓的勢力侵入中國市塲。但這項日鈔僅是强迫行使的，每每遭遇人民的拒絕，因此日方又偽造「法幣」朦混，在東京僞造中國中央交通三行法幣，運到我國使用。聞第一批巳運到我國的，數目達三百五十萬元，這種僞造『法幣』遍佈於淪陷區中，廣東戰區，也曾發現。但數目並不多。日方這種行動，是爲近世文明國家所朱有。推行這植僞幣的方法，是搭入僞機關僞員薪金及工廠工資混用，但各商人民衆，都嚴予防止。</p>
<p>關於防止偽造法幣問題，聞財政部將提出下月初旬召開的全國財政會議討論，研究一個切實防止的辦法。本港銀行界亦準備遣派要員出席，會議地點，聞在重慶，這次會議對於抗戰經濟，很有重要性的，將來對於防止僞造法幣，定能商有效果。</p>
<p>該銀行家又吿記者，財政部目前對於取締偽造法幣，也訂有辦法八項，不過辦法祗是如何制止行使，而不是根本杜絕僞造的法稱混入，故預想在全國財政會議時將有所補充。茲錄取締日僞鈔票辦法於后：</p>
<p>（一）凡日僞鈔票，無論在任何地方，一律禁止行使收受。前項日僞鈔票係指×國銀行所發鈔票及×軍所發軍用票，僞「聯合準備銀行」鈔票，暨日僞所發之其他性質相同之鈔券。（二）凡各戰區之軍隊或其他機關，如查有爲×方收藏轉運或行使日僞鈔票者，除將鈔票全數沒收外。並應將人犯送由當地或就近軍法機關，依懲治漢奸條例第二條帮助×國擾亂金融論罪。其意在圖利，以法幣及金融或匯兌方式換取日僞鈔票者亦同。（三）關於前條所行沒收之日僞鈔票，無論類額多步，應卽逐案全數繳送當地或就近軍政長官驗收，轉呈軍事委員會交由財政部處理之。（四）財政部收到前項沒收日僞鈔票時，應按照其查獲數額酌給獎金。（五）凡各戰區內外無論公私圑體軍民人等，如知有秘密組織或個人收蔽，或轉連幷行使日僞鈔票時，應立即報請當地軍警機關逮捕究辦，經捕獲訊實後，除將人犯依照懲治漢奸條例第二條規定懲處外，其查獲之日僞鈔票並依照本辦法第三條規定辦理之。（六）各軍政機關對於前所訂之原報人姓名，除嚴守秘密外，並報由財政部酌給獎金。（七）如有確知本辦法第五條所訂各項情事隱匿不報者，經軍警機關查明後，應以通×論罪。其藉故誣陷者，應依刑法從重處斷。（八）本辦法自核定之日施行。（雋）</p>

<h3>參政會閉幕式　蔣議長致詞全文（續昨第三版）</h3>
<p>訓迪全國人民　同人責無旁貸</p>
<p>我們要在抗戰之中，奠立民主基礎，不但要使人民切實養成行使政權的能力，更必須使人民了解民主的眞諦。我們參政員是人民的領導者，要負起訓迪的責任，要保護國家的利益，和全體人民的利益，對於藉口自由民主而破壤國家法令制度，滅弱整個抗戰力量的行爲，要一致發揮公正與論的權威，而予以制止。我們要使一般同胞，都明瞭現在爲抗戰要實行軍政，爲建國要實行訓政，這中間參着不得一些處僞，容不得有些微障碍。我們必須借鑑已往的覆轍，切度遵循總理遺敎所訂的步驟，爲眞正的民主政治，奠立永久而良好的基礎。總理一生在政治上的奮鬥，目的是要實現三民主義而歸政于民，但是不經過訓練的人民，是决不能主政的。總理生前勉勵我們知識階級與革命同志要作民衆的保姆，要以公僕的地位，行師保的責任，這一個敎訓，實在是建國成功必循之大道。</p>
<p>必須言行實踐　要作民眾表率</p>
<p>我們要視民衆爲國家的全體，我們的主人，我們要敎他，訓他，保育他，最後還政于他。等待他們都成立了，民主政治也實現了。我們要盡到這個使命，必須我們同人在會內會外以身作則，尊重法令，遵守紀律，竭盡忠誠負起責任，古人說：「其身正，不令而行」。又說：「以身敎人者從」我們要作民衆的楷模，就必須言行實踐，負責任，守紀律，我們發表言論，一字一句，都要對國家負責，我們的一舉一動，都要遵守法令和紀律，以此精神，作民衆表率民衆自然接受我們的訓導，而後我們訓迪感化的民衆，總能實行眞正的民主政治，政府召參政會的目的，就是要我們共同負責，做伊尹，做周公，政府希望在軍事結束的時候，訓政的工作，已經同時完成，換句話說，就是希望抗戰勝利之日，即是建國甚礎大定之時。政府對我們如此企望，對我們期待得很殷切，我們應該如何努力，綫能無負呢？民主政治是否能建立，責任完全在我們。國家民族是否能復興，責任亦完全在我們。</p>
<p>大會重要議案　一一促之實現</p>
<p>三民主義最終目的大同世界自由實現的節目，亦卽禮運上所載的綱要，由我們參政員同心愛戚的來提倡，綫能造成國民勤勞生產和互助的風氣。五中全會希望全國致力的加强團結，積極奮鬥，與加緊建設的三點，由這一次會議中，許多議案，而更具體化，也要我們參政員同人宣傳，率先力行以風動社會，機能推進實施的功效。我們參政會不是一個平常時代的議事機關，我們是同患難共甘苦，同心戰力，安危共濟的抗戰禦侮的領導機關。實在是民力所賴以集中，我們參政員同人，不僅坐而努力，而他僩人都能起而實行，這一種不避艱危不辭勞苦的實行精神，巳經著有很大的令譽。現在抗戰第二期開始，成敗所關，更見重要，各位會畢之後，分赴各地，務望秉着本屆大會的共同意志和决議，貢献精誠，貢献力量，提高我民族精神，發揚我國固有道德，對於這一次大會幾個最重要的議案，如加强兵役制度，實行精神動員，推進經濟建設，整頓各地保甲，尤其希望各位同人負起倡導推動的責任，各就担任工作的所在，分頭努力，一一見之於實行。不但政府可以得到不少的帮助，實在是國家民族與全體同胞所利賴，當此大會閉幕的時候，我瞻念未來艱鉅的工作，對於同舟風雨的各地同胞，實在不勝其企望，敬祝諸位共同努力，使抗戰勝利，建國成功！（完）</p>

<p>我們政治之應以民主反法治爲基礎、完成建國之原則、亦爲國人所共曉、値此抗戰日益有利、建國正在開始之際、我人尤宜淖勵民主法治之精神、確立民主法治之制度、以期訓政早有實責的成就、而爲憲政預立穩固的基礎、茲謹列舉理由如左、</p>
<p>（一）我國政治習慣、凡改進之事、類皆自上而下、現在不但國家有空前之統一、而全國更有共戴之領袖、苟能乘此時機、由領袖奠定民主法治之基礎、樹立國家恒久之制度、其事甚易、其效亦宏、機不可失、此共一、</p>
<p>（二）民主及法治基礎之樹立、至少須有十年乃至廿年之功夫、國人提倡民主及法治、雖已有四五十年之歷史、但從無近五年不斷之推行、我人此時旣有共戴之領袖、則正應趕速爲最大之努力、于此後一二十年中、使中國得有民主及法治之穩固基礎、幷進而成爲一理想的近代自由國家、時不可緩、此其二、</p>
<p>（三）我國過去十年來、舉凡政治軍事、皆有顯著之進步、但此進步、實爲少數人之努力所造成、無論在政治上或經　上應有之制度、旣從未確立、守法之精神、亦至爲普遍、爲國家之永久計、一切設施、必須早日使之制度化、此其三、</p>
<p>（四）我國年來國家日趨統一、政府之權力、亦日益擴大、凡向日屬私人活動範圍以內之事、而今歸政府處理者、不知凡幾、如人民參政之權力、不能與政府權力之擴張、亦步亦趨、勢必造成一個極權國家、於整個民族之前途、有異常不良之影響、故此時不能不求逐瀟增加人民參政之權力、此其四、</p>
<p>（五）世界各大國、正在形成民主與反民主兩大集團、卽英相張伯倫似亦在此兩大集圑之形勢下、建立民主法治之初步基礎、則同氣相求、同聲相應、近之可以增加民主集團、對我抗戰之同情協助、遠之可以爲世界和平謀共同之奮們、此其五、</p>
<p>（六）各級公務員之責任心、須經啓導培養、方能目動發揮、故如何使公務員能負責任、繫於政治之風氣、尤關於居上位者、如何使其能負實任、至於法治、須先以守法之精神立其身、守法固應爲上下一致之習慣、而在位者之大員、尤應以身作則、負實爲民治之根本、守法爲法治之前提、此二者、蓋皆待早日培植者也、此其六、</p>
<p>基於上述種種理由、同人謹爲下列建議、</p>
<p>（一）政府行動應法律化、我國旣以法治爲理想之目標、政府今後一切行動、須絕對以現行有效法律爲根據、若行動自行動而法律自法律、則法律旣不足以示信上下、卽不能養成守法之習慣、此後一切法律、一經由合法機關與合法手續訂立公布後、在該法未經正式修改前、政府行動之有關者、應以之爲準繩、而不可以一時人事之方便、頗有所違反之、忽略之、或曲解之</p>
<p>（二）政府設施應制度化、我國現値革命時期、政治經濟各方面之一切制度、實質上多未具備、過去一切設施、諸如用人等等、多隨主其事之長官爲轉移、以致事無定軌、官無定職、職責不分、系統不明、長官對之信任、則可任其越權、長官與之無舊、則求食粟而巳、此乃舊時國家之幕府制、非近代國家之長官制也、此乃一時集合之人治、非國家永久之法治也、故今後政肘一切設施、務須求其制度化、務使政府之整個組織、成爲一健全之機能、一經發動、則各部門均能盡其最大最警之效能、使此整個之機能、合乎近代政府行政之原則、茲擇其有關制度應行之重要改革、述之如下、</p>
<p>（甲）吏治制度必須建立用人必須以才能爲標準、然後始能賢者在位、能者在職、歷史上我國官場中用人每每非親即故、以長官之好惡親疏、爲進退人員之標準、此固數千年之積習、今已頗有改正、惜其去淸除猶遠也、除此之外、似莫要於在一切部分中均實施吏治制度（又名文職服務制）、此制普遍推行後、在消極方面、旣可以限制濫私、在積極方面、自可以發揮公正、鼓勵賢才、此納民容物之大道也、</p>
<p>（乙）公務人員權責必須分明、在今日我國政界中公務人員、或者有權無責、或者有責無權、結果所屆、往往一事無人負責、亦無法實某人負責、此後應劃淸權責、使有責者必須其權足以相稱、然後人人皆能盡心力而爲之、而成敗之實任、亦有攸歸、</p>
<p>（丙）機關系統、必須淸楚、一事决不宜交由若干機關執行、否則將無一機關肯負全責、能負全責、至彼此衛突、一事不成、且我國政府機關、多各自爲政、彼此甚少聯繫、如遇某事、必須與其他機關合作者、亦往往不能獲得應有之合作、是以各機關間之關係、必須　淸、以收分工合作之效、</p>
<p>（三）政府體制、應民主化、我國政治之應以民主爲目的、本爲上下一致的要求、故目下所討論者、不在此目的而在以如何辦法、使此目的得漸進的穩妥的達到也、茲謹擬辦法如下、在我國未實行憲政以前、政治之應受中國國民黨指導、與夫政府之應由中國國民黨組織、已爲全國人民所公認、當然不應求其變更、然由黨所組織黨所指導之政府、仍應向國民負責、國民如依法對政府示不滿後、政府仍不能設法滿人民之意時、黨應分別輕重、加以改正或改組、黨應以現有之國民參政會或改善加强後、更有代表人民性之參政會爲民意機關、幷用漸進的方式、使之具有依法監督行政之權力、以上建議、是否有當、敬候公决、</p>
<p>提案人周覽、馬君武、錢端升、黃炎培、盧前、羅文幹、陳裕光、胡元炎、陶孟和、陳時、張瀾、楊端六、默元懷、吳玉章、邵從恩、高惜冰、余家菊、周炳琳、杭立武、胡景伊、傳斯年、許德琳、陳啟天、李元鼎、莘銳、李璜、伍智梅、黃同仇、曾琦、孔庚、林虎、張奚若、黃元彬、左舜生、顏任光、羅隆基、張忠緩、常乃德、奚倫、冷、黃建中、沈鈞儲、緒輔成、張申府、黃幼僑、鄒韜會、王志華、張君勵、王近信、楊振聲、</p>

<p>【路透社倫教廿四日電】昨晚英下院中、工黨議員佛烈查氏質問稱、政府之政策豈仍爲不欲徵集大批步兵、以備開往歐洲大陸應用耶、首相答稱、政府之政策乃在依照本年陸軍計畫而進行、又該項計畫係顯到世界各處之需要而擬定者、佛烈查氏乃質問稱、內相賀爾於去年宣佈、法國一受攻擊、吾人將與之合作、今首相答詞如此、試問如何能相符合耶、張伯倫答稱、「此一問題、余以爲在目前情勢五、實不宜多所討論』、</p>

<h3>歐洲局勢的新曙光（續完）</h3>
<p>現在的情形，比起那時來，是誠然好得多。尤其對於中日戰爭的問題上，美國。英國與蘇聯態度的積極程度，已經令我們可以這麽說一句：祗要我們自己不半途妥協，以及漢奸的政權始終不能生作用的話，那末，縱使不說我們自己的力量，單以當前的國際環境而論，我們×人日本的失敗命運，現在已經注定了。可是，西班牙的內戰問題上，國際的趨勢，却不十分樂觀。西班牙最大的不幸，是和蘇聯和英，美之間，沒有共同的交界綫。和他交界的，却是那個在態度非當動搖的政府領導之下的法蘭西。上一次通訊裏，記者曾指出西班牙內戰問法題在目前歐洲情勢中的作用。這些天來，政府軍的地位，又比以前穩定了一些。如果國際上加緊援助政府軍，還是不遲的。然而，據我們得到的消息，法國外長龐萊，遠在一個多月以前，就以爲政府軍大勢已去，而開始和佛朗哥的代表談判了。這一舉措的幻想是什麽呢？說起來，是可笑的；那是一！拉攏佛朗哥！近兩天來，法國政府已經明白宣佈，派遣代表駐紮叛軍的首鄒了。這，是承認叛軍政府的第一步，是在美國反對下的不得不變相的對意屈服。</p>
<p>法國現政府的幻想能否實現，且不說；要緊的是，在這一問題上，却確實是維繫着國際形勢的未來。西班牙叛軍完全得勝後的德意計劃，據現在所知大，概是：一面由意大利，德國在地中海造成緊張，一面就逼迫法國對非洲殖民地問題上對意的屈服。</p>
<p>此地任何消息靈通的人，都同意：莫索里尼心心念念不忘的，是再來一個「第二慕尼黑」。不過這一次會議的犧牲品，却由捷克變成了法國。至目前爲止，法國當局，是反對這樣一個會議的。當一個月前，張伯倫赴羅馬談話路過巴黎的時候，達拉第明白通知他，法國無論如何，反對以會議方式解决法意間的糾紛，寧願直接和意大利交涉，萬一直接交涉不成，需要開國際會議的話，那末，法國願意照美國綠斯福總統的計劃，加入美國，開一個比較更廣泛的國際會議，談判一切緊急的彼此間的糾紛。</p>
<p>這目前出現着的一綫曙光，是終於促成國際情勢的明朗呢，還是僅僅的是希特勒的一個緩兵之計。現在，還不能斷定。不過，萬一德，意，日三個侵略國，又進一步擴大向世界挑戰姿態的話，末，主要的原因，一定又是和平陣綫中某一部份動搖的結果。——我們大槪可以這麽說。</p>

<h3>轟炸羅湖事件　日答覆英抗議　道歉賠償損失　保證不再有同樣事件</h3>
<p>【海通社倫敦廿四日電】此間政界對於日政府答復英使克萊琪之抗議轟炸九龍新界事、及深致這歉、頗覺滿意，查日外務省致英使之復牒內容、經有聲明保証不再有同樣事項發生、同時亦答允完全負担賠價之責、按此乃日方首次答允賠償破毀物業之損失、並嚴格懲罰肇事之人、又英使奉命。要求日政府將該次事件之實情、在報紙登載、使日本人士明瞭全案、因日本報紙祇請有一戰機誤向英租界投彈而已云、（參閱本報港聞另條）</p>
<h3>莫索里尼的新把劇</h3>
<p>— 董平譯　Ｐ．Ｌfsovsky原著，改譯自『莫斯科新聞』</p>
<p>還是去年十一月三十日那天，，意外長齊亞諾在國會裏胡吹了一頓所謂法西斯意大利的「天然意向」，意國的議員便騷然的鼓噪起來，大議其「突尼斯」，「尼斯」，「薩伏亞』及一吉波的』的口號。</p>
<p>這次無中生有的示威，顯然的，便展開了意大利的反法運動，其目的就是要法國把她自意大利手中『非法』擭去的一些地出海和歐洲的殖民地，吐還給意大利。</p>
<p>這「運動」的第一幕演出之後，對剛自慕尼黑欣然而返的英法巨頭，不啻晴天霹震。於是兩政府乃聯名向羅馬詢問，請求解釋。齊亞諾的回答是：反法示威純粹出於「自然」，意政府不能負責。</p>
<p>這意思，反法運動該不是官方指使的了：可是，十二月十七日，意政府却致牒法國，對一九三五年一月七日的法意協定提出廢約。那協定是由莫索里尼親筆和賴伐爾簽訂，算是解决法意間殖民地糾紛的。這樣的通知廢約，還不就是表示意國官力已乾脆拒絕承認維持殖民地的現狀，而準備掀起重劃殖民地的鬥爭。</p>
<p>意大利向法國提出土地要求，其實也算不得是怎樣新的把戲，只不過是花樣翻新罷了。遠在一九三五年以前的時期中，法意關係，卽會屢屢緊張，在那時當大利也曾聲色俱厲的向法國要求一大堆的殖民土地和政治權利，不過，現在的要求和那時顯有不同罷了。</p>
<p>意大利上次的要求，大部是集中在非洲加德湖區域的，可是在這次却不曾提。相反的，在上次不曾提到科西嘉，尼斯及薩伏亞問題，這次却全捧了出來了，突尼斯則依然跟上次一樣放在要求的第一降，不過上次的要求只是司法和政治的權利，而這次却是乾脆的要據有這塊土地了。</p>
<p>若把意大利這兩時期的要求，加以詳盡的比較，顯然的，便可看出意大利目下的主要目的，是在摟奪地中海上的軍事據點。那是實在的，在經濟上，科西嘉，尼斯及薩伏亞是一無可取；但在軍事上，她們是極端重要的。在將來的戰爭中，地中海的權勢，顯然的，大部將取决于法國的土倫—科西嘉—突尼斯三角防線；這道防線，無疑的將比英國在地中海中部或西部的海軍根據地—直布羅陀和馬爾太—强有力的多。英法兩國海軍聯合在法國三角防綫上的活動，不但綽然控制了全地中海，並且足够封鎖意大利，使她一敗塗地。</p>
<p>因此，意大利便不惜集中一切的力量，來搗毀這道地中海上的法國防綫，而現在無中生有的來提出這樣的土地要求，自然也並不是希奇的。</p>
<p>如果尼斯和薩伏亞被黨大利拿去，那裏就很容易被利用爲進攻法國南部的根據地。於是，法國在地中海上的要點土倫便會直接的感受成脅。意大利如果拿到了科西嘉，他便能在地中海西部建立起頭一等的海軍根據地。同樣的，意大利要是也攫得了突尼斯，那他眞了不得了，她可以完全控制地中海東西兩部間的海峽，根本截斷直布羅陀——馬爾太——蘇彝士的英法海軍交通綫。</p>
<p>至於說到吉波的，在意阿戰爭之前，那裏便在法國殖民地政策上佔着一個重要位置，用以作爲向紅海，東非及阿比西尼亞擴張的支點。在意大利併阿之後，雖然那裏的重要性業已削減，但顯然的仍然是法國必爭之地。</p>
<p>在今日，吉波的最重要的便是作爲法國船隻自歐洲航行紅海至印度洋的煤料站，這條航線對法國的重要性，是無庸贅言的，因爲它直接延及法國遠東最重要殖民地的印度支那。吉波的經濟方面也異常重要。因爲自那裏通阿狄斯阿巴巴的鐵道，是阿比西尼亞貨物出口的唯一通道。在意阿戰前，通過那裏的阿國出口達總額五分之四。</p>
<p>意大利如果攫得了吉波的和這條鐵道，那麽她不但能獲得了大量的經濟利益和進一步的統治阿比西尼亞，幷且可以使她在紅海的政治及軍事地位大大增强騙出法闡西，打筠英吉利，都是非常可能的。因爲意大利一旦統治了吉波的及法屬索莫思蘭，便立刻會嚴重威脅到亞達的英國根據地。她更且可以以吉波的爲支柱，與英國一爭紅海南面門戶的控制權。</p>
<p>意大利的關於蘇彝士遝河的要求，是跟其他性質不同的。唯有這個要求的影響所及，英國比法國重得多，所以，意大利在這個要求上却不敢像其他的一般積極。她此時僅要求與法共同參加管理這條運河。</p>
<p>由上觀之，事實已極顯然。如果意大利眞能把這些土地都一一擭到，那麽，地中海及紅海上的軍事和政治現勢將根本的打破，而她無疑地將成爲這帶海面上的盟主。她不但能擊破英法　軍的封鋇，甚且可以自由自在隨時隨地的來切斷英法交通線。這些勢將轉變了未來歐洲大戰的大局的。</p>
<p>更進一步的說，法西斯意大利的反法運動，幷不是她一已的國家政策，而是德意軸心下的產物，用以準備掀起第二次大戰，以償其重劃世界迷夢的。</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>否決關島設防</h3>
<p>廿四日華盛頓電稱，美國衆議院討論五千二百萬元國防預算案結果，業已否决五百萬元關島增防案。此事似將引起各方的注意。</p>
<p>關島增防計劃，其目的在於對付日本在太平洋委任統治地上的海車建殷，並可爲將來海軍談判與日本交涉時預備有利條件。同時還有兩個間接意義，即一方面有助於英幽遠東利益的維護，另一方面又有助於中國的抗日戰爭。</p>
<p>現在美衆院否决此案，當然會使人失望，而且也與美國利益大相違背。同時又將使日本侵略者最近對英法的威脅更加猖狂。不過我們還應該認淸：（一）提議否决此關島增防案的是共和黨鑲員塞芬，通過否决案的票數是二〇五對一六八，這里可以看到反對否决此案的衆議員仍有相當多的人數，而共和黨少數領袖違反美國最大多數人民利益的反動主張亦更加明顯，他們在羣衆中的威信將更加低落。（二）按照美國衆議院的規例，這個否决案必須轉交參院審核，尙有機會可以否决這否决案。（三）建設海軍空軍根據地四千八百八十萬元一案，已以三六八對四票的絕對多數通過。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以預料，美國援助民主和平國家反對法西期侵略的政策，今後將無變更。因爲美國除此以外別無其他生路，我們希望美國人民能够以更大的努力，去和一切違反此種原則的反動份子展開殊死的鬥爭。</p>
<h3>軍會設告密櫃</h3>
<p>軍委會爲歡迎民衆吿發漢奸及黨政軍官吏貪汚等情起見，特在渝設特別吿密櫃，希望各界民衆盡量揭發好宄，並書就眞實姓名地址，隨傳隨到，當局决代保守一切秘密，如係屬實，另行予以獎勵。由此可見我當局遵守民意嚴懲貪汚的决意。此種辦法大可推行於國內各地。但是這種辦法還不能算是盡善盡美，最好還希望當局能够遵照中山先生民權主義精神，推進民主玫治的實施。一方面趕快成立各省市縣地方參讓會，另一方面參照廣西當局曾經努力推行的村街民大會及陜甘寗邊區實行有效的民主政治辦法，使各界人士能在民衆大會及其他方式的集會上運甩其民主權和；而且一切貪官汚吏，也只有在眞正的直接的民權實施之時，才能失去一切掩護。</p>
<h3>馬票暢銷！</h3>
<p>本港春季大賽馬，將於今日開始舉行。關于此事本身，暫不加以評述、但可注意的是：本年香港馬會所發售的一元一打比一賽馬票，截至昨晨十時，已沽出票數四十二萬七千餘張，預料售票不難超出五十萬之數，本年發出票數之多，打破歷年最高紀錄。這里狂熱購賣馬票的人數中間，中國同胞自佔極大成數。在這不合理的社會，對這種熱中於僥倖發財的人，固然不遑深責，但是我們希望所有本港僑胞，都能一念『覆巢之下必無完卵』的古訓，不再孜孜於個人榮利而忽視國家民族及自身永恒福利所繫的抗戰建國大業。至少不要使同是「一元」的『還債運動』的成續反落於馬票銷數之後，以貽笑於友那人士之前！爲求良心上安甯，還是熱烈地爲祖國而捐輸吧！</p>

<h3>戰地服務一週年</h3>
<p>— 張任濤</p>
<p>九龍各社圑賑聯會北上服務圑工作報告</p>
<p>我想不是健忘的人，都會知道我們這一羣——九龍戰地服務團——於前年的八月，爲了參加祖國神聖的民族解放戰爭，爲了代表九龍各界不願做亡國奴的僑胞底抗戰精神，特別是爲祖國服務的精神，我們數十多個團員，便在港紳杜其章先生領導與帮忙之下，由組織成立而出發了。</p>
<p>當我們離別了温暖的南國的晚上，在省港碼頭熱烈的歡送者，一羣一　的蜂踴而來。救亡底歌聲震動了殖民地裏的大衆，短小精捍的迎貫先生領導了一羣歡送者，高呼着動人的口號：×人打退了才好回來！寧可流血犧牲，不要往後跑……這些口號使我們感動到流出熱淚來·我們便在：『——到前綫去，大顆兒在一起，驅逐我們的×人出中國……』的歌聲中，揚巾別了香島·別了我們這一羣大家都寄居過一個時期的香島·這一切的一切，到了一週年的今天·猶像在我底眼簾出現。</p>
<p>我們這一羣，不敢辜負了九龍僑胞的企望，我們從香港出發到廣州，一直經過漢口而轉南京的行程中，無論在船上。在車中，我們都用着最大的努力來致力於宣傳工作沿途經過的地方，很多不願做亡國奴的同胞，都要求參加我們這個集團，要跟我們到戰地去服務。可是因爲種種困難，我們部一一婉謝了。</p>
<p>到了南京因爲種種客觀環境的限制，使我們不能不參加軍委員主辦的戰訓班，幾位留東的圈員，也參加了留東特別訓練班受訓，這是去年八九月間的事</p>
<p>受訓的生活是相當地辛苦的，然而爲了將來到戰地去工作的實現，我們也暫時忍耐着，無可置疑。爲了參加民俟解放底事業，刻苦耐勞是必須的：在受訓期間是三個月，可是因爲戰局的轉變南京的吃緊，我們便於去年（二十六年）十一月十七日深夜冒雨隨着戰訓班退出了南京，作了一千三百多里的急行軍。行軍生活是更痛苦的，不管風霜雨雪，每天我們都背了自己的棉衣棉被什物，還有一枝步槍·子彈，天天走六七十里路，或八九十里路，有時還要自己推手軍，這種苦處實在囘憶起來都有點無可言述的滋眛。在行軍休息的時候，我們還出發宣傳，演劇，歌唱，個別談話……等。因爲我們這一批廣東老鄉，說的是「南腔北調」的「廣東國語」。民衆聽起來很費神，但這點言語上的困難，漸漸地從不斷工作中克服過來了。現在　我們的北方語，已經是「四通八達」，到處通行了。</p>
<p>行軍到了瓷器的名產地—景德鎭便吿終結，然而時間已花了一個多月，路程已走了一千三百多里。步行經過的省份有江蘇，安徽，江西，三省。就在二九三七年的除夕，我們便在景德鎭舉行了畢業典禮。</p>
<p>畢業後，我們廣東同鄉，便在『二百名優秀幹部派往第一戰區服務」的命令之下，由漢口出發到了河南（第一戰區所在地）的鄭州。因爲要熟識戰區特別環境，和加强政治敎育起見，我們又作了第二次受訓，參加了第一戰區政訓處政治大隊。由抗戰環境的急迫需要，過了三星期的訓練，便分發到各縣去作「民運指導員」，除了曾眉，莊質夫二人派到豫東外，服務團大部份的圑員都分發到豫西。</p>
<p>我到了豫西登封縣已滿半載，在半加來工作當中，我除了推動該縣的敎師們組織了「登封縣敎聯會」，推動了該縣東華鎮和馬谷川的民衆組織了文化界救亡會，推動了該縣的中小學生組織學聯會外，在武裝民衆的工作，由於縣長劉瀟然氏也看重民運工作，雖然不敢說全縣的民衆已武裝起來了，而在最近檢閱的結果，該縣第一區到參加了抗敵自術隊的民衆有七千多人，第二區到參年了自衛隊的民衆五千多人，第三區亦到了五千多人，這完全證明了民衆對於抗戰已有了高度的認識，知道參加組織就是力量的擴大。</p>
<p>最近我雖已離開了登封，而且也有些不明大體的人們恐怕民衆有組織的力量，，由於自衛隊游擊隊的組織續漸擴大，這些英勇的廣大民衆，總有一天拿起自己底槍桿，驅逐××鬼子的機會。（寄自陜西）</p>
<h3>告訴日本</h3>
<p>— 健存譯　譯自士蔑西報</p>
<p>日本對侵犯香港領土，巳經很快的道歉並且也答允賠償人命損失了。</p>
<p>星期二和星期三兩日，日本對這個態度簡直是輕蔑的，而東京昨夭忽而表懺悔，到底爲着何故？</p>
<p>我們知這日本軍部於星期三日下午曾發出一個根本不對事實的聲明，說祇有一架日機侵犯英界，並祇投一彈，更謊該香港日領巳向港督道歉。</p>
<p>其實，昨天日本外相於接見英大使克萊其爵士之後，始提出道歉，無疑其迅捷與炸沉美艦巴納號時之向美國道歉，是並無二致的。</p>
<p>這可表証於世，日本文政機構與其武人間有着這麽樣的存在。</p>
<p>誰也不相信日本政府需要永這地向人道歉，這是貽羞於文明世界的，但是日本政府控制其海陸軍的力量，此諸上海工務局之應付恐怖事件還要薄弱。在這樣的情勢下，惟有任由其不負責的軍人繼續地鬥事件，而日本政府也準備繼續地道歉，然而終至在不久的將來，恐怕有一天會鬥出一個事件而不是來一個道歉所能解答的。</p>
<p>今回事件，日本雖已迅　地道歉，但這事件離了結尙屬遙遠，倫教方面相信大英政府巳準備於正式抗議之後，再向日提出一個比中日戰爭後任何一次爲强硬的通諜。</p>
<p>在外交語調上，或者可以說，如果那輩眞正據縱日本政策上的不負實軍人，繼續再侵犯我們的權益，大必列顚就不能再事容忍。</p>
<p>必列顚如今是行動的時了，就本港而論，我們希望英政府能給日本一個公開的警吿，如法國警告西班叛軍一樣，卽是說如再行冒犯，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，　　　　　　　　　　　　，祇向日軍司令以口頭上的警吿，這顯然是不够的！</p>

<h3>從汕頭到西貢　（續）</h3>
<p>— 華游</p>
<p>我問他、這是什麽意思、他帶着顫抖的聲音回答、那是要留下納稅的、這時候我就用着命令的口氣叫他把它安放在那些要納稅的東西爲一起、同時再往他身上搜索、原來那隻玉環竟在他的褲筒裏給我取下來、同時給我駡了幾句、他的臉一陣靑一陣紅地對我說「把東西拿去納稅呵、」在這當兒、有一個「馬丹—從右邊轉過臉來、意思是在探詢眞象、我想要待吿發、她未必會取締他、蓋兎死狐悲、物各傷其類、而且失物巳追回了、他就本着聖人之敎訓、君子不爲巳甚、就這樣輕輕饒了他的狗命、不然的話、他的飯碗不獨會給我打破、也許要坐上幾年監牢呵、蓋法國人在安南雖然多數是貧婪、但殖民地的政府、對此不光明的行爲也像其他的國家一般痛恨的、當這幕滑稽劇演畢之後、就把他們認爲應該（？）納餉的東西捲往徵稅部那邊聽取徵稅官的旨意、我的意思、以爲那幾件棄西、充其量不外幾塊錢就够了、萬枓不到竟是廿二元、因爲身上只帶了五塊　、只好把東西用那領床幔捲起來、交給那位說廈門話的管理員、暫存在一個倉庫裏、那天午後兩點半鐘前往納稅、竟發現那個小座鐘給人倫去、這倉庫明明有人司守、然而東西也會失落、這不是咄咄怪事嗎、因此就向那徽稅官交涉、他答應議他追究去、隔了一會、果由一個安南人拿來還、據那位說廈門話的管理員吿訴我、那座鐘是給那徵檢查我的行李的法國人拿去、他還對我說、爲胞們一時錢帶不够、東西存在倉庫中，那些法國關員、隨時都可以進去挑選的、倒如自來水筆、雨衣洋氈、熱水壼、稍爲好些、都給他們拿去、等到你拿錢來完稅時、已是沒有東西可以讓你完了、最好你能够先拿一張載明什麽物件的字據、方能把住官司本、不然你是沒奈他何的、可是他那裏肯給你那樣的字據呢、他們只能够給你一張入門瞪而已、弱肉强食、實在是天經地義的一個定理</p>
<p>當我完了稅錢東西拿到手裏時、我認爲手續淸楚了、我就把抑鬱半天的事件向他們宣吿、在這時候我仍嫌自己的力量太薄弱了、一個人的力量是敵不過他們的、但是我又不能不對他們聲明一下、同時又不願意他們明白到我聲明的是什麽話、所以我撇下潮州、厦門、廣州、安南、各種方言、而講起我們的國語來、法國人聽不懂固不待言矣、就是在裏面祖任翻譯的各帮「媽臻」、他們也無從而明白我的說話的、當那徵稅官向那坐在他的旁邊的翻譯員問我說什麼話時、他們都搖頭表示不懂時、我昂着頭向衣箱亭的大門而出、我心裏這樣想着、你們聽不懂我的話、這正是我的計得售了、回到永安旅店之後、把東西交給妻整理、自己就往我國領事館找卓還來沈祖潯兩位燕大的老同學、（按卓君係現任中華民國駐西買副領事）、當他們聽完我述說那法國關員强取我的玉環時、他們也很生氣、他們叫我囘去寫一封公函、然後代我交涉去、當天旁晚我就親自送那封公函到領事館去、第二天一早、領事館那邊就打電話來請我去、到領館之後由卓領事介紹許迺先生（按許先生係鎭江人、現爲隨習領事、）同我認識、許先生向我問了一些關於法國關員强拿那玉環的經過、並間我是否認得那個關員的面目、我說面目是認得來、不過叫什麼名字可就不曉得、他說只要認得那個人就算了、這樣我們就坐着領館的汽車往衣箱亭疾馳而去、</p>
<p>到了衣箱亭的鬥口、那鐵門是緊緊鎖着、許先生把名片送給那個守門的阿拉伯人看、他趕快把門開了、走到徵稅官的面前、他把名片遞過去、那徵稅官向許先生握手作禮後問他到來有什麽公幹、這時候許先生就對他述到他們的關員昨天强拿後底玉環前來索討、那徵稅官就駁問道、「旣是我們的關員拿了他的玉環、爲何他昨天沒有提及呢』許先生聽完他的說話、就轉過頭來問我是否曾對他們提過、我就把昨天納完稅後對徵稅官說過那段話、重新對許先生複述一番、當許先生把我的話問那徵稅官轉述之後、他沉吟了半晌、他似乎記憶起來了、終於首肯着、這時候他就命令許多關員出來給我指認、當我指定那個關員說、「就是他」時、多可憐呵、他的臉色都變靑了、徵稅官間他是否拿過我的玉環、他竟很忠實地承認起來、但是他說那是我送他、同時他還拉出一個安南人來指證、許先生問我是否送他的、我就對許先生說、我對他根本就不認識、自然談不到戚友囉、你想這據我有送他嗎、進一步說、衙門根本就不是送禮物的塲所、就是我送他、他可以拿嗎、許先生根據我的說話、兼之他的法文是異常嫺熟、法律也甚精通、駁得那幾個法國官吏啞口無言、終於很不高興地說道、「午後兩貼半鐘來拿」、我們于是勝利了、許先生吿訴我、午後來拿玉環時、最好同幾個强有力的人一塊來、因爲恐怕有什麽意外的事情發生、</p>
<p>當天午後我大着胆子同永安旅店的一號「媽臻」張祥進君前往索回玉環、那時候雖然是兩點半鐘了、但是徵稅官還未來辦公、那狐假虎威亂踢箱囊的安南人開了鐵櫃取出那只玉環來、問我是否就是只這一、我接過手來端詳了一下對他點了頭、但是他說、那位徵稅官現在仍未來、不知他要納稅否？你們暫且坐待他，一直等到三點鐘的時候、才看見那個徵稅官坐着汽車向衣箱亭寡駛進來、先前我嘗迷信過法國人是如何守時刻、至此才使我知道他們的辦事官員也象我們貴國一般官僚氣味太濃厚了、當徵稅官走進了他的辦事處、那我目爲狐假虎威者、竟向他說、我那隻玉環是如何寳貴、如何値錢、這意思就是要他徵了重稅、使我沒法子拿囘來、當時我就這樣想着：假如他眞的要那樣做、那末越顯出他們的小氣來、於是張君也對我說：如果他要抽重稅的話、那未就不打理他、再請領事向他們辦交涉、那徵稅官聽完他的走狗一番說話之後、他拿着那隻玉環翻來翻去、端詳了五分鐘之久就對我們說道：納三毫錢稅、他這個辦法、一則可以替他的囘胞洗淸了賊名——他們並不是强奪你的呀、那是留下徽稅呵！我聽他要納稅、就對張君說我不納、東西給他們搶去、現在來索討、反向他們納稅、這是不對、同時我又覺得無論那個國家、一般婦女都免不了要帶些裝飾品、比方以他們的法蘭西來講、他們的婦女何曾沒有帶過王器呢？他們到我們的大中華民國遊歷時、我們常使他們徵收像這樣零件的稅項嗎，我帶來的玉環並不是成了樁件、這就証明、我並不是什麼商人、無論從那方面講，我是不能繳納這三毫錢的、當張君聽完我的說話時、他對我說道，你的話我不敢說理由不充足、但是你須知我們的國家太弱了、而且來到他們殖民地的領土裏，多少親要吃點虧呵、你聽我的話吧、我就替你納去、他說完了這段老於世故的話後、即掏了荷包完結了這件事、</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>今天足球賽　快活谷連枱好戲　南華兄弟分戰東方及香港會　光華對警察米杜息對士葛兩役料亦可觀</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】本屆甲組足球聯賽、在五閱月的競爭過程中、沒一隊不在努力創造與建設其地位、直至現在、均已走入第二循環的重要階段、錦標問題亦將到達最後關頭、而去解决之期不遠了、</p>
<p>目前各隊的地位姑無論高或低、而其過去的創造與建設的勇氣總是彼此皆同、所差別的祗在球藝之優劣和實力之强弱、因此、遂分開創造成功　建設失敗的兩條途徑、那地位高的便是未來奪標主角、那地位低的則係中途落伍者、但無論任何一隊、總要在分數表中不致空白、雖所獲至少至微、亦係用血和汗創造出來的勝利品、</p>
<p>說到錦標　　、刻下還是一個謎局、等待着揭曉、惟照形勢觀察、現在績分表中、　軍與南華南已居於超然的地位、冠亞兩軍、無疑地僅爲該兩隊所共爭、故可以說、「當世英雄、唯我與使君、至於現居第三位置的東方、比南南少却三分、似乎希望微弱了、然而戰局至多變化、說不定不久的將來、東方或會因人成事而得以後來居上、蓋成敗之數數至難逆料、海軍與南南固未敢自保其前途無往不利、患得患失、勢所必然、假如該兩隊他日果有折挫、則東方自可脫穎而出了、</p>
<p>我且來算算該三隊截至現在止的球賬、然後冉談今天的球事、讀者按圖索驥、自可明白該三隊今後的成敗、足以影響大局是何等重要了、照上表看來、海軍比南南不特已多一分、而且海軍已賽十六次、南華祇賽十三次故海軍的奪標希望、較爲濃厚、雖則海軍他日還要與南南作第二次比賽、未卜勝利誰屬、然卽使南南能够奪此兩分、惟對于其他各役、仍須全勝、方可完成大業、不然的話、恐怕冠軍終是海軍的、又以該兩隊已往戰績而論、海軍僅一敗於南南、和局則有三次、此外無役不勝、南南除了十次勝利、　局全無、失敗三次、故相與比較、海軍因敗所失的分數、實少於南南、所以根據　點、我眞替南南前途担　、至於東方因地位略爲落後、祗有坐觀成敗、從中取利而已、</p>
<p>哄動一時的港菲坤際賽、在前幾天的熱閙場面中造成一頁歷史、及今迥思、眞有盛會不常之感、然而、港中的足球界永在活躍的、今天聯賽、甲乙組又有多幕舉行，一般球迷尋求刺激的機會、繼續着不會　全停止的、看吧、　塲好戲今天又開演了、</p>
<p>甲組四　隊、全數出動、故少不免的其中必有一幕同室操戈、這就是東方對南華華、兩個歡喜寃家、此次乃係在木屆最後相逢、且看又算出一筆什　賬、</p>
<p>南華　則戰形同「破落戶」的香港會、毫無疑義的、南南必勝、戰爭地點、與東方對南華華同在香港會塲、分先後而舉行、連檯好戲、看不看由你、</p>
<p>光華乃對中西合璧的警察，這幕球事、工力悉敵、定多看頭、米杜息對士葛一役、亦會引起丘八們的注意</p>
<p>調查所得、南南將仍以日前洶汰九龍會於銀牌複賽那次一樣的人馬上陣、軍容　整、實力極　、以此出戰人材零落的香港會、則勝負之數、可不待戰後而知了、復可斷定屆時香港會的陣綫必以用乙組球員混合而成、因爲史堅拿與碧禮日前已離港返英、阜拉又於埠際賽時觸傷胸部、入院治理、還未痊可、正是一屋漏兼逢連夜雨　、「足球紳士」之有今日、將作何感想呢、</p>
<p>南南排陣如下、至於香港會的人馬、刻下未知、所知到的必是甲乙組球員、聯同上陣、</p>

<p>南華　自希望沒落後，戰續一次不如一次、因此、莫軍師决意設法訓練後起人材、以備他日用、所以今天左翼一職、打算調譚振　担任、田榕發或亦有用着之處，此外大致無變、實力還不錯、東方則原班上陣、　爲希望所驅使、不得不然、看來東方勝利呼聲亦甚高、　方點將如下、</p>

<p>光華各將、勇於改進、全軍精神頂好、雖過去的戰績、半凡之極、但此乃另一問題、未可相提並論、旣然他們現在都肯虛心以求深造、則努力尋求之　、必有效果、今天出戰警察、因彼此實力不相上下、他們正好盡量發揮、貢献各個的球藝、或許勝券就在此中找得出來吧、兩軍排陣如左、</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……法宮艷后</p>
<p>Marie　Antoinette</p>
<p>本片、在任何方面、都足稱爲偉大成功的作品、片中每一個場面、都充滿着動人的羅曼斯、和緊張恐怖的悲劇情調、同時瑙瑪希拉和泰倫飽華在此初度合作中、更能把法國尾禾一個皇后悲慘的命運、唯妙唯肖的表現出來、他們兩人在片中的演技、已是達到表現藝術的最高峯、</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉在片中飾一滿懷着熱情與希望的奧國公主、不幸嫁給了生性癡呆的路易十六、她失望之餘、遂縱情於奢華淫逸的生活中、幷愛上了化臣公爵、但終於因浪費國帑、自滿情慾、不得八民的諒解、和路易的庸碌無能、弄至民不聊生、革命爆發、而在此時代的變亂中、造就了她極悲慘的命運、</p>
<p>片中把這一段動人的歷史事跡、活活如生的搬上銀幕、佈景與服裝方面、也皆極盡偉麗堂皇的能事、同時本片對於皇后奢侈淫逸的生活、和造就她那種性格的環境、與及當時法國革命的情形、皆有極迫眞的描繪、更增加本片的眞賣化、此部「法宮艷后」是一部極値得介紹給觀衆的作品、艷妻扮婢記</p>
<p>一部諧趣瘋狂的戀愛喜劇、故事內容有着相當的趣味、描寫一段笑話叢生的婚事、雷米蘭在片中飾一美國運動選手、剛從巴黎帶同初婚的嬌妻囘來、却爲要挽救父親的破產、不得不和某輪船公司老班的兒女假意訂婚、又因沒法子安置嬌妻、這位新媳婦只好暫瞞着家婆與家公、充當女僕、結果在此特殊的情形之下、鬧了不少笑話，</p>
<p>女主角奧林白烈娜飾演此種諧趣活潑的角色、很適合她的性格、在片中有令人滿意的演作、雷米蘭的演技也神妙有趣、導演者把本片處理極其輕鬆生動、是一部堪供娛樂的佳作、</p>
<p>東方……惡霸橫行</p>
<p>Racket　Busters</p>
<p>上半部較沉悶、下半部則頗爲緊張、通體說來、還不失爲一張『流氓敎育』中的好片子、亨弗萊飽嘉一向以演棍徒着稱、在這裏表演細膩、刻劃人微、簡治勃倫亦好亞倫强令斯演來本已說滑稽脚色的態度、格洛麗狄克遜則根本是一個贅物、可以用不着、</p>
<p>大華……大　特</p>
<p>Beau　Hunks</p>
<p>國泰……小歌伶</p>
<p>Lfttle　Miss　Broadway</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒無疑的是被公認爲目下銀幕上最紅的「小歌伶」，由她來演這齣戲、當然又是廿世紀影片公司的生意眼，</p>
<p>劇情麽、還是那一套看厭了的、玄虛庸俗之極、可看的只有她脫離孤兒院與院中友伴分別的一場戲，其餘的抱歉得很、</p>
<p>秀蘭更長大了些、謝謝好萊塢電影商人、造成了她一股「成人腔」、當然是「好萊場型」的成人腔調、眞正孩子的天眞氣味、在她是所餘不多了、而且不久之後、相信就連這一點也會摧殘了去、</p>
<p>歌舞尙可、塲面則未見其偉大、最後一塲、「法庭劇場」也平淡無奇、</p>

<h3>論通訉的文學性</h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>通訊以迅速報吿社會現實動態的各面爲主要性能。它和普通新聞不同的地方，就是不特要負　着對於現實事物的報　的任務，還有着提高讀者的文學修養和認識社會現實能力的更高的任務，所以它在報章裏站着非常尊貴的地位。</p>
<p>這樣的通訊，我們便不能不强調其文學性，它是要通訊員藝術的去寫的；換句話說，一篇通訊該是一篇報吿文學，因爲報吿文學正是以迅速報吿社會現實動態的各面爲主要性能；而通訊要獲得讀者的歡迎，必要有文學的手法。</p>
<p>『我還沒有够熱練的技巧，不能寫小說，所以先來寫報告。」這是把報吿誤認爲比小說低級的東西了，而且特別誤認爲在技巧上報吿是「理合」比小說低些的；這樣的誤解表見於作品的，就是寫作的潦草：這是茅盾先生給我們鄭重指示的。</p>
<p>而存在寫作者心中的還有一種更不輕的錯誤，就是把通訊誤爲比報吿文學低級的東西，而且特別誤以爲在技巧上通訊是「理合」比報吿文學低些的；這樣的誤解表見於作品的，就往往不僅是寫作的潦草和毫無剪裁，而且是沒內容！</p>
<p>所以，這種誤解是趕快給予糾正的，通訊和普通新聞之差異，就在於文學性之有無，沒有文學性的通訊，便是普通新聞的故意拉長，對於報章，他不特是「理合」得不到尊賣的地位，更可以說是妨礙篇幅的「長物」。</p>
<p>現在一般通訊，注往是通訊員的「行紀」，裏面也很豐富地裝飾着景物的描寫，或偉人的場面，總之是所謂「美麗的句子」：但這僅是文學的外衣，並不就是我們意味着的文學性。我們的意思是：通訊的寫作要受着一般文學法則的支配。</p>
<p>比如說吧，在一個地方，耳聞目見的是非常龐雜的諸種相，我們報吿那一些？就需要着選擇；在一個事件中，我們報吿那幾點和放棄那幾點？就需要着剪裁；選定了的村料怎樣生動逼眞地報吿出來，就需要着「形象化」的手法。</p>
<p>這還不是最重要的，最重要的是我們需要有正確的觀點，要努力從社會波動申；找出各個事象的聯繫，各個事件的因果。有了正確的觀點，上面所說的選擇和剪裁，才會是有效的。一簡通訊，她也要「具有使人從特殊看出一般，從個別看到全體的本領」。我們意味着的「文學性」，主要是這個。</p>
<p>現在的一般通訊，都顯出通訊員工作的不够深入，把握現實的能力的貧乏，和文學手法的缺欠，從通訊，我們祗看到一個個孤立現象的報吿，瑣碎事實的叙述，和抽象的紀錄。比如報吿刦後地方的民衆動態，便是「自×人退出××後，城內及各鄉民衆均紛紛囘來，雖目睹殘垣斷壁，無家可歸，但却幷不表示悲觀怨恨，反而加强了抗戰情緒。現在那燒去了房子的人，多搭草棚暫住。幷抱了咬緊牙根，自力更生的决心，從事抗戰工作，…」這樣的通訊簡直距離文學性太遠了。因而他是無法使讀者獲得實感的，更談不到提高文學修養和認識能力。抗戰推動了報章上通訊的發展，唯有報章才能多多刊載通訊。所有的通訊能够是文學性的，便構造了報吿文學的充分發展的形勢。這社會現實動態的正確而生動的報吿的不斷出現，將提高了人們對于現實的認識，對於社會改革的關心，引　生活實的踐的加强；同時也築造了文學高度發展的基礎。我們强調通訊應具文學性，是有着這重大的意義的。</p>
<h3>新文藝的要件</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>一到寫實派的時期，文藝就重在生活問題的探討；打倒了爲文藝而文藝的遊玩態度。問題的文藝，目的在于宣傳思想，灌輸知識，陶冶性情，藉以敎養太衆，對于文藝的本質，只是利用罷了。所以無論是自然主義或者新理想主義的作品，和教們所急需的抗戰文藝，都得切切實實的有益於人生，新文藝是策動革命的利器，這于主義正大以外，還有三個重要條件是値得注意的。</p>
<p>一，要有鼓動的力量，新文藝固然要有所示範，更其要有能激勵讀者的力量，不但要吿訴讀者應該怎樣做，而且要使得讀者在不知不覺之中照着所提示的自然而然按步就班的實行做去。世界上　着許多聖哲的名訓格言，但只冷冷的擱在圖書館裏，對於人間　不發生日麽關係，因爲是靜的，死的。新文藝該是活的，動的；這要作者懷抱熱烈的感情，寫得眞實透切，才能够深深的打　讀者，使得活躍起來。消極的暴露手段，在新文藝中也有相當的地位，可是也要含有激動的力量，使得讀者不自主的憤槪起來，會得實行去撲滅那些醜惡的事情。</p>
<p>二，要有好的影響；古典文藝的字句很夫麗，讀起來也好聽，可是對於讀者，往往只能給些模糊的印象。浪漫文藝雖然來得熱烈，容易使人喜歡，可是重在情感上的挑撥，對於正當的生活問題，往往缺少確切的提示。使人讚了以後，只是飄飄然不知所措。有些人長於雄辯寫得天花亂墜，有些人善於迎合心理，說得娓娓動聽。這在作者個人可謂相當成功；但是影響所及，對於社會禾必有益，或者反而有害。新文藝必須能够發生良好的影響，在有熱情足以鼓勵以外，還要有正當的提示，所謂人生的批評，人生的指導，是新文藝的必要條件。無論是明說的也好，暗示的也好，反激的也好，總要能够發生良好的影響才要得。</p>
<p>三，要淸算得出强大的功效；有種作品，在某些人裏雖然可以發生點良好的影響，但限於偶然的機會，功效不大，這是缺乏晋徧性的緣故。育種作品，在知識豐富的人雖然可以發生良好的影響，一般不曾多受敎育的人却看不懂，功效也不大，這是不曾太衆化的緣故。新文藝要有普徧性，必須通俗化，以大衆爲對象，總要準備消算起來可以得到强大的功效的才對。</p>
<p>這三個要件中，「響影」的關係最大，「淸算」只有功效大小的問題，「鼓動」也只有能否發生功效的關係，影響所及，如果不合，反而受害，所以關係最爲重大。那末我們估計一篇作品的價值，决不能以表面的言詞爲前提，必須細細考查其用意所在，將會發生什麽影嚮而加以判斷。</p>
<h3>宣言</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>讓我們把夜　一槍打死吧！</p>
<p>讓火藥的芬芳代替紫羅蘭的幽香吧！</p>
<p>讓所有的花花草草都在馬蹄下枯死吧！</p>
<p>我們要唱新的歌</p>
<p>用血和淚　成的歌詞，</p>
<p>因爲我們都是新時代的戰士！</p>
<p>讓戀愛的詩篇都由木乃伊去欣賞吧！</p>
<p>讓美麗的詞藻都由化石去吟詠吧！</p>
<p>讓　司永遠在冷宮中　泣吧！</p>
<p>我們要騎上戰馬，</p>
<p>挺起槍——</p>
<p>把新歌在戰塲中放唱！</p>
<p>我們要唱新的歌，</p>
<p>新的歌要中四萬萬五千萬支喉嚨一齊高唱：</p>
<p>一直唱到變色的山河還原！</p>
<p>一直唱到亞細的喑夜　光！</p>
<h3>劉家潭</h3>
<p>— 痕</p>
<p>劉家潭的蘆草，巳被割得留一段段極短的根，若是起了大風，潭裏的浪波總想淹沒了它；但，風停了，水依舊是是水。蘆根依舊是蘆根。</p>
<p>每天照例的有一隻漁船停在劉家潭的岸邊。而每天照例的有三兩個穿黃色制服的兵，總繞到劉家潭停漁船的地方。</p>
<p>這天時候已不早了，太陽將爬上中天，漁船在劉家潭的微波上邊動，一個老者，前伏後屈的搖着槳，船見慢慢的向岸邊靠近。奇怪得很，老早便有一個穿黃色制服的兵，站在每天停　船的地方，見漁船由潭波上划來，面龐上浮出喜悅的神氣。</p>
<p>漁船剛靠近潭岸，穿黃制服的兵立時跳上船，用銳利的目光在船上亂看一會，喜悅的面孔，暫時換上一付死色；又望着搖獎的漁夫，漁夫也望着他</p>
<p>穿黃色制服的兵。</p>
<p>「你，」穿黃色制服的兵指着　夫，又用手做出長，闕，能跳，水裏的東西，然後說：「有沒有？」</p>
<p>「有，」漁夫掀起脚下的船艙板，裏面灌得一些水，可以看到有四五條鯉魚在水艙寫。穿黃色制服的乓見了，又換上原來喜悅的樣子。</p>
<p>穿黃色制服的兵，從船的前艙跨到漁夫面前，蹲下矮的身體，用手抓起　裏的鯉魚，抬起頭來又望望漁夫的面孔說：「心交，心交」繼續的用一根繩子，一個，兩個，三個……紮在一起，漁夫望望他，會意到心裏的笑，輕輕　動手裏　，魚船離開岸了。</p>
<p>魚船離岸有二丈多遠了。穿黃色制服的兵，還忙着紮魚，不知道船巳近潭心。漁夫看一看岸上沒有第二個穿黃色制服的兵，便咬緊牙齒，用出撕魚網的那股膀勁，提起了蹲在船上的陌生兵，往水裏一掀，魚，兵，一起下了劉家潭。水面起了極大的浪花，魚船不住的在簸動。</p>
<p>漁夫看見水平浪靜，徵笑着臉，　着船離開了劉家潭。</p>
<p>天又起子大風，吹起了巨浪，捲過了蘆根，濺起白的水花。劉家潭裏常是這樣的，風住，水依舊是水，蘆根依舊是蘆根。可是次這浮起一件黃色的東西，半截在蘆根上，牟截在水裏。</p>
<p>自這夭起，劉家潭裏的一隻漁船，巳尋不到一些影蹝。岸上，穿黃色制服的兵也看不到了。</p>
<h3>街邊故事</h3>
<p>— 鐵光</p>
<p>我站在街邊看看報攤上的報紙，有沒有可惹人注意的標題。一家小報好像有意在這舊曆新年元旦日子裏，更鮮明的暴露它的態度來多招引一些在這年節休閒的行人的注目。然而新年裏休閒的行人，大多都是中華民族的優秀兒女，至少也可以說是不願意做亡國奴的好種。所以縱使這家小報用着大號字標着如下的題目——日佔海南島後國內和平大有轉機；然而並沒有人注意。同　這也不過說明了和平妥協，屈服投降的無恥論客與文壇浪人還沒有絕種，我於是去問報販道：「這家小報究竟賣得不　得？」</p>
<p>坐在地上的報販搖着頭有點不高與問我說：『一天賣不到三張，我本想不賣它，但是他們死也要送來。」</p>
<p>够了，這位忠實的報販巳替我們正確的報道了。這是下午三時左右我所接觸到的事體。</p>
<p>到了晚上七點鐘，我又出現在一個街邊有着一百多個的也在度新年的下層羣衆中去聽着說書者在那裏很有神氣的講述着故事。</p>
<p>我細心一句一句的聽着。他所講的巳經不是那些古書上的故事，那些征東征西，三國誌，楊家將這一類的東西。而是明明確確的把日本近衢的陰謀與汪精衛的通電的事實，串揷而成了一篇很惹人動聽的故事。一百多個的聽衆，畢竟也沒有誰發生厭倦之感。</p>
<p>我驚奇這位說書者的聰明，我更敬佩他的思想意識，都能在這民族解放大戰鬥中淸除了他的說書的舊內容的滓渣。</p>
<p>我發生了着英大的快慰的情感，我的快慰不僅是在於說書者都能運用着舊形式新內容的題材來博得聽衆的同情，主要的還是他能够胆敢諷刺了，暴露了民族的昏虫們的和平運動的可憐與可恥，而這也正好好的答覆了我在白天裏所見到那家小報的造謠的標題。</p>
<p>我於是便覺得度這舊曆新年也還有點味兒。鷄肉猪肉雖沒有得吃，但到底聽到了說書者這樣的講法也覺得吃過年鷄年猪一樣有味。</p>
<h3>中國人的團結力</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>族途隨感之二</p>
<p>中國人一向的團結力，比之歐美人，也許確實差些。外人譬之爲之一盤散沙，我們不必力爲分辯，只應該拿這句話來警惕我們自己人罷了。因爲最顯明的地方，便是社會經濟的結構，不是將整個中國人的生活聯繫得緊密，而是各個地方幾乎都可以辦到自給自足，無須依靠另一地方的供給，始能存在。像抗戰已這麽久了，好些離戰綫遠的區域，除了有徵兵的影饗而外，到如今還是和平時一樣。要在這般生活狀况下，團結起來禦侮，是必得大費一番宣傳力量的。</p>
<p>謝謝×人的飛機！倘如他們不拿炸彈炸到後方來，將死亡與焚燒，威嚇着每一个中國人，我相信今日中國人一致禦侮的精神，與乎同仇×愾的忿怒，一定沒有這麽旺戚，這麽猛烈！因爲在後方，任何動人的宣傳，任何驚心的標語，却不及一座燬炸的房屋，一个炸傷的屍體，來得深刻！總之，我們中國人，一致抗日的精神，不斷地長增，有些地方是不能不歸功於日本的轟炸機的。</p>

<h3>Armed Peace and a World Federation</h3>
<p>Last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain appealed to the nation to support the government's policy of seeking peace through armament. On the other hand, news from New York indicates that prominent American international relations expert Mr. Streit has just published a new book, stating the necessity of an organized federation of democratic countries in the world. Mr. Streit believes that "only through the rapid unification of democratic countries can world order and happiness be maintained." Chamberlain and Streit share the same goal of maintaining world peace, but their methods differ slightly.</p>
<p>Chamberlain strongly stated: "In today's world, military stockpiles are piling up like mountains, inevitably causing concern and even incidents; a single misstep could trigger a major war." He further stated: "If war were to break out, no corner of the world could escape its impact." This is a realistic assessment. However, regarding the measures to be taken to prevent such a crisis, Chamberlain stated: "Only by arming itself can Britain safeguard its rights and freedoms and avoid swift attacks by others." Britain's national policy is to seek peace through armament, and we have no fundamental objection to this principle. However, today's world struggle is a struggle between blocs. For the past seven or eight years, the aggressive nations that have disrupted world peace have already formed a de facto international bloc, and their looting and encroachment are mutually reinforcing and colluding. Because their actions are collective, Germany and Italy can disregard the major European powers of Britain and France, acting arbitrarily throughout Europe and even encroaching on Africa. Japan in the East dares to "swallow bombs," invading North China from our Northeast, then Central China, and then South China. Now, the occupation of Hainan Island has created a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific. The root cause also lies in the aggression of this bloc. The major powers, originally the decision-makers in world politics—Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union—have been at a loss in the face of the rampage of these aggressive nations for the past seven or eight years. The fundamental reason is that the democratic countries being invaded cannot resist the aggressive bloc with collective strength.</p>
<p>Mr. Chamberlain's national policy of "seeking peace through armament" is certainly not wrong, but the armament of Britain alone, that is, the independent action of Britain alone, is still not enough to achieve peace. At the time of the "September 18th Incident," because Britain could not cooperate with the United States to sanction Japan, the destruction of the balance of power on the mainland led to the situation today, and the destruction of the balance of power in the Pacific has already begun. Military conferences between Germany, Italy, and Japan are also being held in Berlin, with Japan advocating an attack on the Soviet Union, while Germany and Italy emphasize simultaneous attacks on Britain, the United States, and France. In this case, there is only one way for democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to stop the aggressors' frenzy: to unite effectively and quickly exert collective pressure on the aggressors. Therefore, Mr. Streit suggests: "To solve world problems, democratic countries should unite under joint control on diplomatic matters"; and states: "Currently, the fifteen democratic countries of the world should organize a large federation." The organization of a large federation by the fifteen democratic countries of the world may be too idealistic at present, but at a minimum, the four major democratic countries—Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union—should quickly unite and act against the aggressors. The most fundamental key lies in whether Britain deeply feels the necessity of the close connection of these four major countries and whether it has the sincerity to take joint action. The British side has repeatedly stated "the connection between Britain and France," but rarely mentions specific ways to connect with the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly review the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the aggressors. Leaving aside the strong attitudes that the United States and the Soviet Union have expressed towards the aggressors in the past, looking only at recent facts, the opportunity for Britain to connect with the United States and the Soviet Union can be considered quite ripe. On the American side, there is already a great sense of threat from top to bottom: "The United States is at any time likely to be attacked by Japan in the Pacific. At this time, the United States will confront the three dictatorial countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy." (Republican Congressman Mott's speech in the House of Representatives yesterday); another Congressman, Marsh, also warned Congress, saying: "Once a policy of concession is adopted, it will be endless. An inch can be conceded, then a mile can also be conceded." On the 22nd, the US Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullitt, also said: "America's geographical isolation is a thing of the past. Now, America is engaged in military reorganization and is committed to defending the democratic front." American public opinion is mostly dissatisfied with the isolation policy, and actively supporting the democratic front is not a problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, the attitude of the Soviet Union goes without saying. Recently, Japan has repeatedly threatened the Soviet Union under the pretext of fishery treaty disputes, but the Soviet Union has remained unmoved. Yesterday, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, again met with Litvinov to negotiate the fishery treaty issue, lasting for two hours. Togo even threatened the Soviet Union with Tokyo's instructions, saying: "The Japanese government has decided to take any necessary steps to protect Japanese fishing in Soviet territorial waters." However, Litvinov replied: "If the Japanese government does indeed engage in fishing with Japanese warships as reported in the Japanese press, then disputes will inevitably be difficult to avoid, and the serious consequences that arise may go beyond the scope of local incidents." Its stern and resolute attitude towards the aggressors is evident on paper. The Soviet Union is naturally willing to cooperate with Britain, the United States, and France to sanction the aggressors.</p>
<p>Britain should quickly "seek true peace with true armament"!</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From February 18th to 24th, 1939</p>
<p>The two weeks between mid-February and late February included the Lunar New Year. Regarding the evolution of world and Chinese affairs during this period, we published an article entitled "World Dynamics During the Spring Festival" the day before yesterday, listing the major events of the seven days of the Spring Festival to report to readers. Now, in addition to what has already been mentioned in the above-mentioned article, we will give a brief report on the events that occurred in these two weeks, especially in the latter week:</p>
<p>Full-Scale Resistance, Overall Stability</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the situation of our country's full-scale resistance war has remained extremely stable. Since the × army in South China landed on Hainan Island on the tenth of this month, although it has continued to reinforce its troops in an attempt to occupy the entire island,</p>
<p>its strength is ultimately limited, and its troop strength is still insufficient. After our military and civilians fought heroically, it is still being blocked in various coastal areas. According to the telegram on the 23rd, the × army has suffered nearly 10,000 casualties to date, which is a quarter of its landing strength. If we can quickly provide practical assistance to the military and civilians resisting on the island, then even if we cannot quickly drive out all the ××, we can still exert its role in containing most of the × troops, which will help the development of the overall resistance situation. In the West River and North River areas of Guangdong, our army has actively shifted from confronting × to taking the form of counterattacks in the past two weeks, and the East River area has also been able to continue to hold a large number of × troops in stalemate. Therefore, the new offensive plan of the × army in South China cannot be realized. In North China, the × army continues to reinforce Jin and Yu in an attempt to concentrate its forces to cross the river and invade westward, while stepping up attacks on various guerrilla areas in an attempt to eliminate the dangers to the rear after the westward invasion. Therefore, in the past two weeks, the situation has been fierce on both sides of the Yellow River in southern Shanxi and northern Shandong, and there have also been tragic battles in various places in Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, eastern Shandong, and northern Shanxi. However, because our army's frontal interception was victorious, the entire Yellow River line remained unshaken, and the battle progress after ×, and the victory reports from various routes in Sui and Cha, made the so-called New Year's Day offensive of the × army in North China unable to unfold. In Central China, the two armies north of the Yangtze River continued to clash at times. South of the Yangtze River, our army's counterattacks on Yueyang, Wuchang, and various places north of Xiushui prevented the × army from realizing its plan to cut off the communication routes from Zhejiang East, northern Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Great Victory of Our New Air Force</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, our country's new air force has successively assisted in battles and made contributions in various war zones across the country. × warships on the Yangtze River and × positions north of the Yellow River have suffered particularly heavy losses. In the fierce battle over Changsha on February 15, our army shot down seven × aircraft. In the fierce battle over Lanzhou on the 20th, it shot down nine × heavy bombers. Including fuel and bombs, each aircraft costs about one million US dollars. Including the cost of education and training for air service personnel, the total loss is more than ten million US dollars. And it has been verified that 23 × army air service personnel have died, which is a terrible loss for the × air force. On the 23rd, 23 × aircraft invaded Lanzhou again. Our new air force resisted heroically and shot down six more × aircraft, with no losses to our army. Since the second phase of the War of Resistance, such great success of our country's new air force is first due to our country's government's national policy of actively building a new air force, second is due to the automatic assistance of friendly governments and people such as Britain and the United States, and third is the Soviet Union's assistance in building an invincible air force base in the Northwest. The failure of the × army's westward invasion of Lanzhou this time shows the consolidation of the Northwest defense on the one hand, and also shows the first major blow to the Japanese aggressors from the close cooperation between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union on the other hand.</p>
<p>Significant Progress in Politics and Diplomacy</p>
<p>The Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth Plenary Session held during the transition period of the new stage of the War of Resistance clearly demonstrated the common policy of the two major political parties in China to strive for victory in the War of Resistance under the common principle of building the country with the Three People's Principles, and demonstrated the common policy of the two major political parties uniting all parties to lead the people to improve politics and complete the great cause of resistance and national construction. The third session of the National Political Council from the 12th to the 21st of this month further demonstrated the common demand of the people of the whole country to support unity</p>
<p>and persevere in the War of Resistance. Under the leadership of the supreme leader, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, this conference passed as many as 88 important proposals related to military national defense, economy, finance, internal affairs, diplomacy, education, and culture. Regarding the major gains of this conference! This newspaper has already reported in "World Dynamics During the Spring Festival" the day before yesterday. It is particularly noteworthy that the motion to support the national policy of resistance and the motion to support Chairman Chiang's stern criticism of the Konoe statement actually expressed the deep hatred of the people of the whole country for × people, traitors, pro-Japanese anti-communist elements, and their propositions! It expressed the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country for the government, the leader, the development of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the close cooperation of various anti-× parties to persevere in the War of Resistance. In addition, resolutions such as the amendment of the conscription law, the improvement of the judiciary, the national spiritual mobilization, and the organization of special committees are all important resolutions that meet the needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and national construction. And Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his opening and closing remarks, especially pointed out that "the historical mission of this conference is to enrich the political foundation of the Three People's Principles, especially to establish a permanent and genuine democratic political foundation, which occupies a very important and glorious position in the history of China's political system." Along with the progress of our country's politics and the new adventures of Japan × in the Far East, the diplomatic situation is also becoming more and more favorable to us. The Soviet Union's aid to China movement is of course actively developing, and the British government is also considering further aid to China. On the 22nd, British Foreign Secretary Butler also reported in the House of Commons that the British National Bank would approve an increase in the amount of export credit loans to British commercial firms to 75 million pounds, and allocate another 10 million pounds to commercial firms to handle "development projects."</p>
<p>Japan Changes Adventurous Strategy</p>
<p>Since the Japanese aggressors have suffered serious resistance in their military actions in China, the dispersion and lack of troop strength and the domestic economic difficulties and the crisis of the people's anti-war sentiment have further hindered their new offensive plans, so the voice of "Japan × changing its strategy towards China" has spread everywhere. The new strategy of the Japanese aggressors is to shift from focusing on the Northwest to focusing on the Southwest, and at the same time, it is actually based on the solid defense of our Northwest and the powerful military preparations of the Soviet Far East, so that Japan × changed its strategy of first attacking the Southwest and threatening Britain and France. Thus, there is the strategy of occupying Hainan Island, , thus, there is also the strategy of seizing the Shanghai concessions! The ultimate purpose of this strategy is naturally to promote the realization of the so-called "Japan 'Manchukuo' China Group" and the "New Order in East Asia," while the current purpose is to cooperate with Italy and Germany in preparing for a new strategy in Europe, threatening Britain and France in the Far East. The first step is to have Britain and France cut off the transportation of China-Burma and China-Vietnam, cutting off China from obtaining foreign aid from the Southwest, and the second step is to have Britain and France pressure our country to negotiate peace and surrender.</p>
<p>The Question of Unity Between Britain, France, and the United States</p>
<p>The new offensive launched by the Japanese aggressors and the Italian and German aggressors in the East and West, , has raised and expanded the surge of anger among the revolutionary parties and progressive people in Britain and France against the government's compromise movement, and at the same time, it has forced the rulers of Britain and France to realize the crisis of the future of their compromise policy. , has forced the British government to consider its tougher attitude. After protesting against the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, it has also clearly announced that the British government will not hesitate to take decisive action to deal with the illegal atrocities of the Japanese planes bombing the British border at Luohu. The close attention of the two regions and the two countries to the Hainan Island incident, the passage of the British government's plan to increase 800 million pounds of national defense bonds on the 21st, the French Prime Minister's declaration on the 22nd that "France's policy is the same as that of the United States, and France cannot cede an inch of land," and the increasingly close cooperation between Britain and France and the consultation between Britain and the Netherlands on joint defense against aggression, show that Britain and France have a tendency to unite to resist aggression. However, this tendency is not firm enough and needs to be consolidated and developed by the anti-fascist and anti-aggression people's front in the two countries. As for the United States, President Roosevelt declared on the 18th that he opposed fascist aggression and called on the forces that love democracy and peace to unite. American reporter Mr. Streit's book "Today's Federation" suggested organizing a federation of democratic countries to solve world problems, which aroused the attention and support of all Americans. According to a report by the American Public Opinion Association on the 22nd, the association's recent poll of public opinion showed that the majority supported the United States giving up its isolation policy and supported "If Germany and Italy attack Britain and France, the United States should do everything possible to help Britain and France." This shows the enthusiastic support of all Americans for the anti-fascist aggression policy, and the opposition forces such as Hoover will eventually fail. The passage of the new national defense bill by the US House of Representatives on the 15th further proves that the policies pursued by Roosevelt have gained the support of the vast majority.</p>
<p>Increased Prestige of the Soviet Union at Home and Abroad</p>
<p>What I would also like to specifically report here is that the domestic and international prestige of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, is increasing day by day. The new trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Lithuania has been concluded, and various agreements to adjust Soviet-Polish economic relations have also been signed in Moscow on the 19th of this month after weeks of consultation. This is enough to show the new success of Soviet foreign policy, making Poland gradually become a wing of the forces of peace from the clutches of German aggressors. In addition, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the countries along the Black Sea is also being coordinated. The new British-Soviet trade agreement has already started, and negotiations on the Soviet Union's purchase of warships from the United States will also be actively carried out. With the start of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's international status has been further enhanced. This is naturally an optimistic phenomenon for the democratic peace front. As for the Soviet Union's aid to China movement, which is manifested in the strengthening of our Northwest defense, the growth of our new air force, and the suspension of Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations, the serious situation of Soviet-Japanese border and Soviet-Japanese maritime conflicts, etc., is very obvious. On the 23rd of this month, the entire federation enthusiastically celebrated the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and declared to the world the determination of the entire federation's Red Army and workers and peasants to defend the socialist motherland and resist fascist aggression. In addition, the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be convened on March 10, which will surely have more important decisions and strength to develop the strength of the peace front and eliminate the forces of the fascist aggression bloc. We should actively participate in and resolutely fight for the Chinese nation's liberation struggle and the world's anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle with greater courage and perseverance. We must win, and we will definitely be able to win—</p>
<h3>Industrial Cooperation in Our National Economic Mobilization [Continued from yesterday]</h3>
<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>Small factories have simple organizations, making it easier for the authorities to reach a consensus and act swiftly. Fourthly. The location of small factories is more flexible, allowing them to benefit from sourcing materials and selling products locally. Fifthly. Therefore, although small factories have their shortcomings, they can still have their own strength. Moreover, if they can be operated in a cooperative manner, they can also have organizations such as cooperative societies and federations of cooperative societies, so that they can have both the advantages of large and small factories without their disadvantages. This is the third point. China is rich in resources and vast in territory, but transportation is inconvenient, so small indigenous industries are almost everywhere. The development of China's industry will certainly not lead to the complete elimination of such small industries and household industries. However, we must actively improve the production organization and manufacturing technology of such small industries and household industries. Industrial cooperation is the most appropriate way. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of rural areas, China is still an agricultural country today, so economic policies must focus on the prosperity of rural areas. However, to achieve the prosperity of rural areas, it is necessary to develop rural sideline occupations, which can be operated in a cooperative manner. The income of Chinese farmers is only a few tens of yuan per year. Without income from sideline occupations, even in a bumper year, it is still not enough to meet the needs of supporting the old and raising the young. Therefore, sideline occupations are the main source of supplementary income for Chinese farmers. This is the first point. In addition, agriculture is seasonal in production, and there must be a considerable amount of time to allow rural labor and time to be utilized. This is the second point. If we consider the economics of agricultural management, if agricultural products can be processed and then transported and sold, not only can the value be increased, but it is also easier to preserve. This is the third point. Agricultural management will inevitably gradually tend towards collectivization, so surplus labor in agriculture must be planned for in advance. The development of rural sideline occupations has the effect of absorbing this surplus labor. This is the fourth point. Moreover, industry has the power to enlighten thinking. If industry can be gradually distributed in rural areas, the degree to which rural people adhere to old methods will inevitably change rapidly, and scientific thinking can be deeply rooted in the people. This is the fifth point.</p>
<p>The above points refer to general situations. At this time of war, the importance of industrial cooperation is even more felt. Before the war, most of China's industries were concentrated in the coastal provinces. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, the limited and weak foundation of our national industry has been completely destroyed by violence. To remedy this, the government has moved factories from the front to the rear as much as possible, which is a good solution. However, at this time, the major cities in the rear are also often subjected to aerial bombings. Without air defense facilities, they may still be destroyed. Therefore, all industries that do not need to be manufactured in a concentrated manner should be dispersed in the countryside. The scale of these factories will not be very large, and a cooperative approach should be adopted. Moreover, in wartime industries, in order to unite labor and capital, it is even more necessary to adopt a cooperative organization. However, the aftermath of these factories is not the urgent task of industrial cooperation. Even if a cooperative organization can be used to improve the management of these factories, it is not enough to compensate for the losses of the industries in the front. It is necessary to improve the organization and technology of the original small industries and household industries throughout the country with cooperative efforts, and create new ones from them. Then, its contribution to the production of wartime industries is indeed significant. If we want the industrial raw materials and industrial labor in the war zone in China today to still be utilized by our side, I am afraid that organizing industrial cooperation in rural areas in the war zone will also be necessary.</p>
<p>All of the above are reasons why China should vigorously promote industrial cooperation. The specialized agency promoting industrial cooperation in China today is the China Industrial Cooperative Association. The association is actually established with funds allocated by the Executive Yuan. However, because it was initially initiated by the Westerner Rewi Alley in July last year, and there were plans to request financial assistance from other countries, it is named an association. The association is now promoting its work separately in several regions, including the Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, Central South, and Sichuan-Kang regions, and has achieved some results, but it is still far from ideal. Because I am aware of the importance of this task and the difficulty of the work, I would like to briefly describe the points that should be paid attention to below, based on my limited knowledge.</p>
<p>First, the organizational structure of the Industrial Cooperative Association itself should be strengthened. The scope of the association's business covers the entire country, even war zones and remote provinces, so if its own organizational structure is not sound, it will not only be unable to actively promote the progress of business in various regions, but also be unable to passively supervise the business in various regions. I have carefully examined the nature of the association's business and believe that, first, its powers should be relatively centralized to facilitate the exercise of all powers. During wartime, actions must be particularly swift. If those responsible are constrained by others in everything, it will be difficult for them to achieve anything. However, at the same time, the work of the offices in various regions must be relatively autonomous, because the environment of the offices in various regions is different, and they must respond flexibly to achieve results. If they must ask the head office for instructions on everything, progress will be difficult. Therefore, the administrative structure of the association must properly determine the method between centralization and division of labor, so that it is neither too scattered nor too constrained, and the work efficiency will be improved. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Second, the relationship between industrial cooperation and general cooperative administration should be adjusted. Since the importance of industrial cooperation is as described above, and now there is a nationwide association engaged in promoting it and responsible for investment, the cooperative authorities in each province will be too busy to welcome it and will never refuse to promote it. However, because both parties can promote this cooperation, the so-called rural cooperative committees in each province are a customary term, and their work is not necessarily limited to rural areas. Moreover, the association is also trying to promote industrial cooperation in rural areas. Moreover, the cooperative authorities in each province also belong to the Construction Department, so the confusion in the duties of both parties is unavoidable. In addition, since industrial cooperation is also a type of cooperative, it will undoubtedly be subject to the constraints of the Cooperative Law together with other cooperative organizations, and the cooperative authorities in each province are the executive agencies of the Cooperative Law. I believe that the cooperative authorities in each province should not strictly enforce the Cooperative Law, so that the promotion of industrial cooperation will encounter various obstacles, because China's Cooperative Law is generally aimed at rural cooperatives, and focuses on the needs of rural credit cooperatives. Other relevant regulations are also the same. In normal times, it may not be fully applicable to industrial cooperatives. Since the outbreak of the war, the situation has become very different. Therefore, at this time, the legal basis for industrial cooperatives should be temporarily relaxed, as long as it does not violate the spirit of cooperation. As for guidance, the Industrial Cooperative Association should set up promotion associations in various places, invite local cooperative administrators to participate in the guidance work, or the association's regional offices and sub-offices should absorb the original cooperative administrators in various places to concurrently serve as positions in the association. If the personnel are already connected, the work can be adjusted. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Third, industrial cooperation should be made to match its name and reality. The purpose of promoting industrial cooperation is to promote industrial production in a cooperative manner, not just the promotion of industrial production. Therefore, the spirit of cooperation between workers and investors must be earnestly cultivated, so that this type of factory can indeed be more meaningful than ordinary factories, and the relationship between labor and capital can be fundamentally improved. Otherwise, merely possessing the beautiful name of cooperation without the spirit of cooperation will not only not help the improvement of the cooperative movement, but will also confuse the public's hearing, which is very inappropriate. Moreover, there are many ways of industrial cooperation, and the degree of cooperation is different. Therefore, if it is said that it is not easy to organize a strict and formal industrial cooperative at this time in China, there are also many ways to adapt. The principle is to fully express the spirit of cooperation. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Fourth, the cadres of industrial cooperation must be trained. This training can be carried out for cooperative personnel and industrial personnel. The industrial cooperation movement is a nationwide movement, and the number of cadres needed will be very large. Although some of the work can be entrusted to the original staff, I am afraid that it will still be necessary to supplement them in large numbers. Moreover, China's past cooperative training paid little attention to industrial work. Although the Cooperative College had a special subject on industrial cooperation, and also had supplementary courses such as industrial and commercial management, the number of trainees was small, and they could not all be employed. Therefore, this cadre training is essential. In provinces with more cooperative guidance personnel, if it is possible to contact the provincial cooperative authorities to draw cooperative guidance personnel from various counties in stages for training in industrial cooperation and industrial common sense, it is a win-win situation. As for the training of industrial personnel, several central factories of different industries should be designated as training locations, recruit workers, and earnestly train them, so that the trainees can have practical opportunities in addition to technical training and cooperative training. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>Fifth, the operation of industrial cooperation must be economically sound. The operation of various cooperatives in China in the past has mostly failed to achieve economic viability, which is a great regret. The reason why we advocate cooperative organizations is not only to increase the number of cooperative units, but to ensure that cooperative organizations can indeed make the operation of enterprises more economical than before they were organized into cooperatives. Although what we call economy may not be measured by monetary figures, it must at least be able to have a firm grasp of sound development under certain circumstances. Therefore, before an industrial cooperative is established, the capital, factory site, labor, machinery, technology, raw materials, market, transportation, and member composition of a certain industry should be carefully investigated and planned. If there are many organizations but they are not sound, it is better to have fewer organizations and strive for their perfection. The development of industrial cooperation is the basic work of national industry, and it should be able to continue to grow and last for a long time. It is essential not to organize and release quickly to show the speed of the association's work, because if the cooperatives fail one by one in the future, the responsibility will also be borne by the cooperatives. Whether the association's work is tense or not can be observed from many aspects, not just the number of cooperatives. This is the fifth point.</p>
<p>Sixth, the development of industrial cooperation should have a comprehensive plan to provide assistance. In terms of regional division, it is now being carried out in separate regions, but in fact, due to transportation and political relations, the scope of each region is still too broad. Guizhou and Yunnan seem to be able to form a separate region, or even one province as one region. The central location within the region should also be properly planned to ensure that it is suitable for raw materials, machinery, power, market, transportation, and member composition. In terms of business, the question is which industry to start with in order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. Finally, there is also the question of organizational steps. Should we focus on creating new businesses, or should we reorganize existing industries into cooperatives, or should we merge several small industries in a cooperative manner? It is also worth studying. If there is no predetermined plan, then it will feel that cooperatives can be organized everywhere, and industries can be organized into cooperatives, and it will inevitably feel that there are too many threads and there is no way to start. Even if we try hard to start, we will inevitably feel that human and financial resources are being wasted. Due to the lack of talent and funds in China, we must ensure that every bit of strength can be used in the most economical way. Therefore, we must determine a plan, grasp the facts, distinguish the priorities, and proceed step by step. During this wartime, everything is relatively chaotic, and it is impossible to ask for a detailed plan. However, having this plan as a guide for progress, and then supplementing the deficiencies of the original plan at any time and place, is not too late. The value of having a plan is only to determine a concrete direction. However, the drafting of the plan must be based on facts, so investigation work is also essential. At this time, it may not be possible to send personnel to various places for detailed investigations due to time and expense constraints, but it may be possible to select several central locations as investigation areas, and entrust the local government to conduct investigations in other places. Now, every county in the country has instructors. If they can be used well, widely solicited, and then send specialists to conduct on-the-spot inspections of those that are more valuable, the cost will not be high and the results will be significant. It may be worth trying. This is the sixth point.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Northern Henan and Southern Shanxi; Our Army Captures Wuzhi County Seat; Tension in Southern Guangdong as Enemy Ships Continue to Increase</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin on the 24th from Our Newspaper] Our army on Hainan Island is still engaged in a bloody battle with the enemy. Patriotic civilians are active everywhere, posing a great threat to the enemy. The enemy has been unloading a lot of munitions on the island, apparently intending to occupy it for a long time. Enemy ships are arriving on the Qiongzhou sea, attempting to land and invade our Xuwen. Our railway, Beihai, and Weizhou Island in the Gulf of Tonkin also have an increased number of enemy ships. According to military judgments, the enemy has a final conspiracy to invade Guangxi. It is reported that the enemy plans to start operations next month. Our defenses there are very solid, and the enemy will suffer heavy losses if they invade.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 22nd] More than 1,000 enemy troops stationed in Chengmai Old City, Qiongzhou, are forcing merchants and civilians to register. On the 19th, more than 100 enemy troops, accompanied by more than ten tanks, invaded Fushan (near Jiaji in eastern Hainan). Our army is in a stalemate with the enemy.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 24th from Our Newspaper] Many enemy troops have been transferred out of Guangzhou. Our guerrillas are taking the opportunity to attack the suburbs, with frequent skirmishes. The enemy is still rushing to build fortifications on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangjiu Railway, seemingly taking a defensive posture.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an on the 24th from Our Newspaper] Although the enemy at Hejin and Fenglingdu has been attacking for days, they have not succeeded due to the heavy shelling by our river defense artillery. Our guerrillas are still attacking the enemy along the Tongpu line at any time. Our counter-offensive in southern Hebei is progressing. Yesterday, the guerrillas attacked Daming and achieved some gains. The war situation in Shandong is improving. The enemy dares not advance eastward due to our interception. Our army will launch a large-scale counter-offensive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] The more than 500 enemy troops in Wuzhi have been under constant attack by our army and are now unable to stand their ground. They fled in full force at 8 pm on the 20th, some to Xiuwu and some to Muluan Township. Our regular army has recovered Wuzhi and is now stationed in the city. Also, the wooden bridge erected by the enemy between Wuzhi and Muluan Township has been destroyed by our army.</p>
<p>Surprise Attack on the Enemy by the Xiang-E Special Forces</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 23rd] Taking advantage of the enemy's unfinished sweeping and mopping-up operations, our Eastern Hubei guerrillas used the opportunity of the abolished Lunar New Year to launch fierce attacks on the enemy along the river. They successively recovered Longping, Wuxue, and Tianjia Town, and also attacked and forced Danchun East Gate. Except for the enemy in Longping, who was annihilated by our army, the enemy in Wuxue and Tianjia Town suffered heavy casualties, totaling no less than 1,000. Even more military supplies were burned and seized by our army. Now, the heroic guerrillas who have recovered Wuxue and Longping have voluntarily withdrawn to avoid being sacrificed by enemy naval shelling, but Yangcheng Mountain is still under our control. More than 500 enemy troops from Huang'an, accompanied by two artillery pieces, recently suddenly invaded northward and occupied our Qiliping yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 23rd] Since our army launched fierce attacks on various places near Yueyang, the enemy has suffered heavy casualties. The railway east of Yueyang has recently been destroyed by our army section by section, making it impossible to transport reinforcements. The enemy in the city has been firing artillery for days to put on a show of strength.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, 23rd] Since Yangloudong was recovered by our army, the enemy in northern Hunan has been extremely panicked and hastily mobilized troops to encircle our army in four directions. Our army saw through their trick and set up ambushes in advance. The enemy launched an attack on the 21st and fell into our ambush, suffering many casualties. Our army believed that Yangloudong had no long-term defensive value and has moved to a certain place nearby, launching surprise attacks from time to time, making it difficult for the enemy to rest for a moment.</p>
<p>Our Army Counter-Attacks in Jiangsu and Anhui</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 24th] The enemy entrenched at the railway station in the eastern section of Suihai continued to invade eastward towards Xin'an Town. Our army met them head-on and fought for several hours. Due to the enemy's heavy artillery fire, our army temporarily retreated to nearby villages, waiting for reinforcements to launch a counter-offensive. The enemy in Lianyungang has been encountering attacks from our army every time they invade westward, and they have not been able to make progress. The morale of the soldiers is generally low, and there have been several cases of soldiers committing suicide by jumping into the sea because they miss their families.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 24th] More than 600 enemy troops of the Kodama Detachment stationed at Xishui Kou and the Jinpu Line in northern Anhui invaded Wei County on the 20th of this month. Fierce fighting broke out with our army in Xiao County in the Wazi Kou and Yonggu area, with aircraft providing cover and assistance. Our army responded calmly. Due to the enemy's heavy artillery fire, our army suffered heavy casualties and was temporarily withdrawn by County Chief Peng. They reorganized their forces and returned to the county in recent days, and sent civilians to form an anti-enemy force. At dawn on the 17th, they launched a fierce counter-attack on the enemy in Gushan. The enemy's Yun Detachment of more than 100 troops and the puppet army of Mi Ganchen were surrounded by our three sides. Our army fought bravely, occupied the mountain, and threw more than 100 hand grenades at the enemy in the market. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and only dared to fire with machine guns and artillery without daring to attack. After a stalemate of half a day, our army returned to its defensive position and continued to launch night attacks on the enemy, forming a stalemate with the enemy.</p>
<h3>Military Commission Announces Weekly War Situation — February 15th to 21st —</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The spokesperson of the Military Commission stated that the war situation on the north and south lines in the past week, from February 15th to 21st, has been more active than in the past. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers, in the spirit of fighting harder as they fight, are fighting to continue their efforts. In particular, the brave men of the air force have been killing the enemy effectively, giving the enemy the most fierce blow, making the people's morale and spirit clear about the future of victory in the war of resistance, and have a firm grasp of it. A summary is given below:</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>The situation on the Guangjiu, Yuehan, and Guangsansui lines has not changed much. The enemy in Dongguan Taiping launched an attack on Bao'an on the afternoon of the 6th with a combined force of infantry and artillery. Another unit landed from Nantou on the morning of the 17th, echoing the Xiaotai enemy army. Our position was slightly shifted. Soon a large force of our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce pincer attack on the enemy from the front and rear, taking advantage of the night. The enemy fled to Humen and Dongguan. Our army recovered Shian that night. It is estimated that more than 800 enemy troops were killed in this battle, and Dongxiao can be captured immediately. More than 1,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded in Huaxian, northern Guangdong. The enemy troops in Haikou, Qiongshan, and Chengmai on Hainan Island were jointly counter-attacked by our army and civilians, and more than 3,000 were killed. On the 16th, they landed in Sanya Bay in the south of the island and invaded Yulin in an attempt to contain our army. Our army has divided its forces to intercept them. Also, on the 21st, several enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Chengmai and were shot down by our army.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>Since our army besieged and surrounded Heshun in eastern Shanxi, there have been fierce battles this week, killing more than 1,000 enemy troops. On the 17th and 18th, large forces were also dispatched to bypass the remnant enemy in Xiyang and Pingding. The city of Heshun will be captured soon. The enemy troops in Jiangxian, Henglingguan, and Hengshuizhen have recently increased to 5,000. For days, they have been using superior artillery fire to cover their attacks on Dongguanzhuang and Mishi Tou and releasing tear gas. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely and fiercely, but the enemy has not succeeded. The day before yesterday evening, they turned to Nanniudan, south of Guanzhuang, to launch a flanking attack, but were ambushed by our army halfway. Corpses were scattered everywhere. They are still in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Hunan and Hubei</p>
<p>The front lines in northern and central Hubei are quiet, and our army and the enemy are in a state of confrontation. The enemy entrenched in Jinniuzhen, southern Hubei, was attacked by our army on the afternoon of the 15th. Due to our heavy artillery fire, they suffered heavy casualties and released a large amount of poison gas in a stubborn resistance. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, and more than 2,000 enemy troops killed themselves. Our officers and soldiers took the opportunity to charge and kill, and the enemy collapsed. That night, Jinniu was recovered. The remnant enemy fled to Heshengqiao. The two important places along the river, Jinkou and Huanglingji, southwest of Wuchang, were also successively recovered by our army. The remnant enemy fled to Wenkou, Tongcheng, Beigang, and Wanjia Mountain. Yangloudong Yanzhan, west of Puxi, was captured by our army, so the enemy's land and water transportation south of Wuchang and north of Yueyang is now completely cut off.</p>
<p>Henan</p>
<p>The war in southern Henan is quiet. However, the enemy entrenched in Xinyang was heavily bombed by our air force the day before yesterday, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. More than 2,000 enemy troops in Muyindian, Zhiwu, and Bo'ai in northern Henan invaded eastward in several directions starting on the 17th. They were ambushed and intercepted by a unit of our army, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties, fleeing back along the original route. It is estimated that more than 1,200 enemy troops were killed. Also, more than 2,000 enemy troops in Xinxiang, Yuanwu, and Xiaojizhen were met head-on by our officers and soldiers, and the enemy suffered more than 1,300 casualties. Also, more than 1,000 enemy troops competed from Qinyang eastward and were hit hard by a surprise attack by a unit of our army on the 15th. The remnant enemy fled in a panic to Wuzhi, and our army pursued and attacked them, annihilating more than 400 enemy troops.</p>
<p>Other Areas</p>
<p>Our army in southern Hebei launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the enemy in recent days. In the battle of Qinghe on the 17th, more than 900 enemy troops were killed. In the battle of Daming on the 18th, more than 1,500 enemy troops were killed, and the three counties of Jiaoyang, Erning, and Rendi were successively captured. Hejian and Lixian are also continuing to be besieged and will be captured soon. In Fanchang, southern Anhui, our army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy invading from Digang. More than 1,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded, and the commander of the Changze unit was also killed by our army. In addition, Zhou Xuanchen's puppet army of more than 3,000 troops in Xuzhou, Liu Huzhen's puppet army of more than 2,000 troops in northern Sui, and Yu Zhiqian's puppet army of more than 3,000 troops all defected to our side this week and cooperated with the local our army to bravely kill the enemy. The enemy was at a loss and felt a serious threat. In the air battle in Lanzhou on the 20th, nine enemy aircraft were shot down, and the enemy's air raid plan was completely foiled. From the above, our army on the land lines has repeatedly won victories, and air battles have also achieved great results, making the enemy exhausted and suffering great mental trauma. It is a great rejoicing for all our officers and soldiers in the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Mediation of the War Is Impossible; Foreign News Reports Are Inaccurate; Official Responsible for Correction</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 9th of this month, Chongqing political figures made a statement to Reuters reporters, stating that peace negotiations between China and Japan must be resolved in a Far East international conference, and that the current Sino-Japanese war situation depends on the European situation. If the European situation adopts a compromise and concession strategy, the international community may exert pressure to force China and Japan to hold negotiations to end the war. Later, a certain translation department received a telegram from General Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, absolutely denying this statement. The telegram said, "The so-called statement by our political circles is untrue and is based on hearsay. It should not be taken seriously. In addition, the rumors of third-party mediation of the war are also fictitious. Please find a way to correct them."</p>
<h3>Residents Evacuate from Chongqing, Chengdu, and Guiyang to Avoid Casualties from Air Raids</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 24th] According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang yesterday ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the people of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Guiyang, as well as banks, telegraph bureaus, post offices, etc., to evacuate quickly, and to encourage banks to build new houses along the highway, provided that these buildings must be equipped with air defense facilities. This evacuation work will be carried out by the Supreme National Defense Commission and must be completed before March 10.</p>
<h3>The Yunnan-Burma Road Will Be Taken Over by the Ministry of Communications; The Road Bureau Advocates the Use of Domestic Rubber-Tired Vehicles</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 23rd] After the Yunnan-Burma Road is taken over by the Ministry of Communications, all procedures have been completed and it can be taken over soon. In order to save gasoline, the Road Bureau has added rubber-tired vehicles to be pulled by livestock. Except for the rubber tires, all are domestic products. The journey takes more than 30 days, and the freight is two-thirds to three-quarters cheaper than by car.</p>
<h3>Trial Flight of China-Burma Air Route: China National Aviation Corporation Plane Flies from Chongqing to Rangoon</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 24th] After long preparations for the China-British air route, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) dispatched staff member Tan Huan, along with driver Xia Bo, on the morning of the 22nd, flying a small Stinson Reliant SR-7 aircraft piloted by Peek Clough, from Chongqing to Yunnan, directly reaching Rangoon for the first trial flight. A Douglas aircraft is scheduled for an official trial flight on the 28th to connect the air routes of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] According to news from the Hong Kong office of CNAC, the China-Burma air route (between Chongqing and Rangoon) will commence operations from Chongqing on the 28th of this month. The aircraft used will be a de Havilland DH.86 type, piloted by Captain Sha Bi. Subsequently, there will be two flights per week, connecting with Imperial Airways (IA). However, IA aircraft will not be able to conduct trial flights until the 1st of next month. It is understood that the route of the China-Burma flights follows the Burma Road. IA has constructed radio stations, temporary airfields, and other facilities, which have also been completed. CNAC has ordered two new DCZ-type aircraft from the United States, valued at US$250,000, which are expected to arrive in Hong Kong by the end of this summer. This new type of aircraft can carry 24 passengers and has a maximum speed of 230 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Preventing Counterfeit Legal Tender: National Financial Conference to Discuss Measures - A Large Influx of Counterfeit Currency into Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Special Dispatch] Recently, in addition to the rampant issuance of military scrip and counterfeit banknotes by the 'Joint Reserve Bank' in North China, Japan has been counterfeiting our legal tender, instigating Chinese traitors and Japanese-Korean ruffians to circulate it in a mixed fashion, attempting to undermine the credibility of our legal tender. The people of our country are paying close attention to this Japanese conspiracy. To understand the government's preventative measures against this counterfeiting of 'legal tender' and the opinions of the economic sector, our reporter interviewed a certain banker to inquire about everything.</p>
<p>According to the banker's opinion, Japan's domestic economic weakness is already clear and obvious, and there is a danger of it collapsing this year. Japan has repeatedly used various economic schemes within the occupied areas, attempting to compensate for its own poverty, but the results have ultimately failed to materialize. As far as is known, in the occupied areas, the inflow of Japanese counterfeit banknotes and non-redeemable military scrip, up to the recent period, amounts to approximately 25 to 30 million Japanese yen. This batch of Japanese banknotes is being used to massively purchase agricultural products such as food and cotton, attempting to use the power of the Japanese yen to invade the Chinese market. However, these Japanese banknotes are only being forcibly circulated and often encounter rejection from the people. Therefore, the Japanese are also counterfeiting "legal tender" to deceive people, counterfeiting banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China in Tokyo, transporting them to our country for use. It is reported that the first batch already transported to our country amounts to 3.5 million yuan. This kind of counterfeit "legal tender" is widespread in the occupied areas, and it has also been discovered in the Guangdong war zone, but the amount is not large. This kind of action by the Japanese is unprecedented among modern civilized nations. The method of promoting this counterfeit currency is to mix it with the salaries and wages of bogus organizations and bogus personnel and factories, but merchants and the public are strictly preventing it.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of preventing counterfeit legal tender, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance will present it for discussion at the National Financial Conference to be convened at the beginning of next month, studying a practical prevention method. The Hong Kong banking sector is also preparing to send key personnel to attend. The location of the meeting is said to be in Chongqing. This meeting is of great importance to the war economy, and it will definitely be able to come up with effective measures to prevent counterfeit legal tender.</p>
<p>The banker also told the reporter that the Ministry of Finance currently has eight measures in place to crack down on counterfeit legal tender, but the measures only address how to stop circulation, and not fundamentally prevent the counterfeited currency from being mixed in. Therefore, it is anticipated that supplements will be made at the National Financial Conference. The measures for cracking down on Japanese counterfeit banknotes are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) All Japanese counterfeit banknotes, regardless of location, are strictly prohibited from circulation or acceptance. The aforementioned Japanese counterfeit banknotes refer to banknotes issued by the Bank of Chosen and military scrip issued by the Japanese army, counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank" banknotes, and other similar banknotes issued by the Japanese puppet regime. (2) If the armed forces or other agencies in any war zone discover anyone hoarding, transporting, or circulating Japanese counterfeit banknotes for the Japanese side, in addition to confiscating all of the banknotes, the perpetrator shall be sent to the local or nearest military law agency and charged under Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors for assisting the Japanese side in disrupting finance. The same applies to those who intend to profit by exchanging legal tender, currency, or remittances for Japanese counterfeit banknotes. (3) Regardless of the amount, all Japanese counterfeit banknotes confiscated in accordance with the preceding article shall be submitted to the local or nearest military and political leader for inspection on a case-by-case basis, and forwarded to the Military Affairs Commission for processing by the Ministry of Finance. (4) The Ministry of Finance shall provide a discretionary bonus based on the amount of Japanese counterfeit banknotes received from the aforementioned confiscations. (5) If any public or private groups, military personnel, or civilians within or outside any war zone know of any secret organization or individual hoarding, transporting, or circulating Japanese counterfeit banknotes, they shall immediately report it to the local military and police authorities for arrest and investigation. After the perpetrator is apprehended and interrogated, in addition to being punished in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, the Japanese counterfeit banknotes seized shall be handled in accordance with Article 3 of these measures. (6) All military and political agencies shall strictly keep the names of the original informants confidential and report them to the Ministry of Finance for a discretionary bonus. (7) If anyone is found to have concealed information regarding the matters stipulated in Article 5 of these measures, after investigation by the military and police authorities, they shall be charged with collaboration with the enemy. Those who falsely accuse others shall be severely punished in accordance with criminal law. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval. (End)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A dispatch from Beiping states that since the "Provisional Government" announced on the 19th that legal tender would be accepted at a discount, the amount of legal tender in the market has gradually decreased. The "Provisional Government" has also issued an order that anyone holding legal tender may exchange it for "Joint Reserve Bank" banknotes at various banks before the 19th. On that day, the Hebei and Jidong branches of the bank extended their office hours to allow people to exchange their banknotes, but only a thousand yuan was exchanged throughout the day. The general public did not go to exchange them. Other branches of the "Joint Reserve Bank" exchanged around 5,000 yuan in five days. Banking observers believe that wealthy people not only do not exchange legal tender, but are actually hoarding it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Garrison Makes Unreasonable Demands: Municipal Council Considers Response - Police Search Door-to-Door in Central District of International Settlement - Witnesses Say Several People Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch, Chongqing, 23rd] A Shanghai dispatch states that the demands made by the Japanese side to the Municipal Council on the 22nd are said to consist of four items: (1) arresting terrorists; (2) expanding the power of the Japanese police in the Municipal Council; (3) reorganizing the Municipal Council; and (4) reserving the right for Japanese troops to take extensive measures within the Settlement when necessary. The demands also stated that in order to avoid international disputes, they did not want to take severe actions for the time being, but that the demand to increase the number of Japanese police officers must be achieved. According to foreign sources, the Municipal Council is currently considering countermeasures, but it is understood that the number of Japanese police officers has already been repeatedly increased, and there is no possibility of further understanding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A Shanghai dispatch states that Municipal Council police, accompanied by Russian commercial groups carrying rifles and machine guns, conducted door-to-door searches tonight in the area around the Sincere and Wing On department stores on Nanjing Road. It is reported that several anti-Japanese bombing and shooting incidents have recently occurred in the area, and the small alleys in the vicinity have been searched, as many of the alleys contain opium dens, gambling dens, and tea shops where terrorists may be hiding. All hotels have also been searched, and several people have been briefly questioned. According to police officers, the search time tonight was from 10:00 PM to 11:30 PM, and no prior notice was issued. However, the police officers refused to answer questions about the results of the search, whether any pistols, grenades, or military supplies had been found, or whether anyone had been arrested. According to witnesses, they had seen several people being arrested. The authorities may formally announce the results of tonight's search in a few days.</p>
<h3>Tashiro Visits British and French Consuls, Also Threatens Tianjin Concessions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A Tianjin dispatch states that the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Tashiro, separately visited the French Consul-General, Li Bi Li, and the British Consul, Hoberti, on the evening of the 22nd, hoping that they would pay attention to the activities of anti-Japanese elements in the concessions, and warned that if the concession authorities were unable to do so, the Japanese side would automatically take countermeasures. It seems that the Japanese actions in Tianjin are echoing those in Shanghai, and they have been preparing for a second inspection, with the possibility of another blockade. Since the 22nd, the Japanese side has installed electric fences on the newly built roads surrounding the concessions, and will also resume stacking sandbags and electric fences at intersections with the British and French concessions.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the People's Political Council: Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Address (Continued from Page 3 Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Instruct and Guide the People of the Nation: Our Fellow Councilors Cannot Shirk This Responsibility</p>
<p>We must lay the foundation for democracy during the War of Resistance. We must not only enable the people to genuinely develop the ability to exercise political power, but also make them understand the true meaning of democracy. We, the councilors, are the leaders of the people. We must take on the responsibility of instructing and guiding, protecting the interests of the country and the interests of all the people. We must unanimously exercise the authority of just public opinion to stop actions that undermine national laws and systems and weaken the entire war effort under the guise of freedom and democracy. We must make all our compatriots understand that military administration must be implemented now for the War of Resistance, and political tutelage must be implemented for nation-building. There must be no falsehoods or obstacles in between. We must learn from past mistakes and diligently follow the steps outlined in Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s teachings to lay a permanent and sound foundation for true democratic politics. Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s life-long struggle in politics was aimed at realizing the Three Principles of the People and returning power to the people. However, people who have not been trained can never govern. Dr. Sun Yat-sen encouraged us in the intellectual class and our revolutionary comrades to act as nannies for the masses and to fulfill the responsibilities of a teacher and guardian in the position of public servants. This lesson is truly the path that must be followed for the success of nation-building.</p>
<p>Must Practice What We Preach: Set an Example for the People</p>
<p>We must regard the masses as the entirety of the country, as our masters. We must teach them, train them, and nurture them, and finally return power to them. We must wait until they are all established, and democratic politics will be realized. To fulfill this mission, we must, both inside and outside the council, set an example, respect laws, abide by discipline, and fulfill our responsibilities with the utmost loyalty. The ancients said: "When one is upright, things are done without orders." They also said: "Those who teach others by their own conduct are followed." To be a model for the people, we must practice what we preach, be responsible, and abide by discipline. Every word we speak must be responsible to the country, and every action we take must comply with laws and discipline. With this spirit, we can set an example for the people, and the people will naturally accept our guidance. Then, the people we have instructed and influenced can implement true democratic politics. The government's purpose in convening the People's Political Council is for us to jointly take responsibility, to act as Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou. The government hopes that by the time the military phase ends, the work of political tutelage will have been completed simultaneously. In other words, it hopes that the day of victory in the War of Resistance will be the day when the foundation for nation-building is firmly established. The government has such expectations of us, such earnest hopes. How should we strive to not fail them? Whether democratic politics can be established, the responsibility lies entirely with us. Whether the country and the nation can be revived, the responsibility also lies entirely with us.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions of the Conference: Promote Their Implementation One by One</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is the realization of the Great Harmony world, the freedom to realize the programs, which is also the outline recorded in the Book of Rites. If we, the councilors, promote it with a spirit of love and concern, we can create a national atmosphere of diligence in production and mutual assistance. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang hoped that the entire nation would devote itself to strengthening unity, actively fighting, and intensifying construction in three areas. Many resolutions from this conference have further concretized these points. We, the councilors, must also promote and take the lead in putting them into practice to mobilize society and promote the effectiveness of their implementation. Our People's Political Council is not an ordinary advisory body. We are a leadership body that shares weal and woe, fights together, and safeguards the country in times of peace and danger, leading the fight against foreign aggression. It is truly where the strength of the people relies on concentration, and we councilors, not only sit and work hard, but others can also rise up and implement it. This spirit of not avoiding difficulties or hardships has already earned us great reputation. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, the success or failure is even more important. After this meeting, you will go to various places. It is hoped that you will uphold the common will and resolutions of this conference, contribute your sincerity and strength, enhance our national spirit, and promote our country's inherent morality. For the several most important resolutions of this conference, such as strengthening the military service system, implementing spiritual mobilization, promoting economic construction, and rectifying the Baojia system in various places, it is especially hoped that you will take on the responsibility of advocating and promoting them, each according to the work you are responsible for, making efforts separately, and seeing them all put into practice. Not only will the government receive a lot of help, but it will truly benefit the country, the nation, and all compatriots. As this conference comes to a close, I think of the arduous work ahead. For the fellow compatriots in various places who are sharing the wind and rain on the same boat, I am filled with hope. I wish you all joint efforts to make the War of Resistance victorious and nation-building successful! (End)</p>
<h3>Establishing a Democratic Rule of Law System: Laying the Foundation for Nation-Building - Proposal by Shen Junru and 50 Others - Passed by the Fifth Session of the People's Political Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Fifth Session of the People's Political Council passed the "Proposal to Establish a Democratic Rule of Law System to Lay the Foundation for Nation-Building" proposed by Shen Junru and 50 others. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The principle that our politics should be based on democracy and the rule of law to complete nation-building is well-known to the people of the country. As the War of Resistance becomes increasingly favorable and nation-building is beginning, we should especially encourage the spirit of democracy and the rule of law and establish a democratic rule of law system, so that political tutelage can achieve substantive results early and lay a solid foundation for constitutional government. The reasons are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) In our country's political customs, all improvements are made from top to bottom. Now, not only does the country have unprecedented unity, but the entire nation also has a commonly respected leader. If we can take this opportunity to have the leader lay the foundation for democracy and the rule of law and establish a permanent national system, it will be easy and effective. The opportunity cannot be missed. This is the first.</p>
<p>(2) The establishment of the foundation of democracy and the rule of law requires at least ten to twenty years of effort. The people of our country have been advocating democracy and the rule of law for four or five decades, but there has never been a continuous promotion in the past five years. Now that we have a commonly respected leader, we should make the greatest effort as quickly as possible, so that in the next ten or twenty years, China can have a solid foundation of democracy and the rule of law, and progress to become an ideal modern free country. Time cannot be delayed. This is the second.</p>
<p>(3) In the past ten years, our country has made significant progress in politics and military affairs. However, this progress was made by the efforts of a few people. The systems that should exist in politics or economics have never been established, and the spirit of abiding by the law is also very widespread. For the sake of the country's long-term interests, all facilities must be institutionalized as soon as possible. This is the third.</p>
<p>(4) In recent years, our country has become increasingly unified, and the power of the government has also expanded. Many things that previously belonged to the private activities of individuals now fall under the government's jurisdiction. If the people's right to participate in politics cannot keep pace with the expansion of government power, it will inevitably create an authoritarian state, which will have a very negative impact on the future of the entire nation. Therefore, we must seek to gradually increase the people's right to participate in politics. This is the fourth.</p>
<p>(5) The world's major powers are forming two major groups: democratic and anti-democratic. Even British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems to be establishing the initial foundations of democracy and the rule of law under the influence of these two major groups. Therefore, seeking common ground and responding to each other can increase the sympathy and assistance of the democratic group for our War of Resistance, and in the long term, strive for world peace together. This is the fifth.</p>
<p>(6) The sense of responsibility of public servants at all levels must be inspired and cultivated before it can be automatically developed. Therefore, how to enable public servants to be responsible depends on the political atmosphere, especially on how those in higher positions can make them take practical responsibility. As for the rule of law, one must first establish oneself with the spirit of abiding by the law. Abiding by the law should be a consistent habit for superiors and subordinates, but high-ranking officials should especially lead by example. Taking practical responsibility is the foundation of democracy, and abiding by the law is the prerequisite for the rule of law. Both of these need to be cultivated as soon as possible. This is the sixth.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we hereby make the following recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) Government actions should be legalized. Since our country takes the rule of law as an ideal goal, all government actions from now on must be based strictly on existing and effective laws. If actions are taken independently and laws are treated separately, then the laws will not be able to establish trust between superiors and subordinates, and the habit of abiding by the law cannot be cultivated. After any law is established and promulgated by legitimate organs and through legal procedures, before the law is formally amended, relevant government actions should take it as the standard, and should not violate, neglect, or misinterpret it for the convenience of temporary personnel matters.</p>
<p>(2) Government facilities should be institutionalized. Our country is currently in a revolutionary period, and the actual political and economic systems are largely incomplete. In the past, all facilities, such as personnel appointments, depended on the leaders in charge, so that things had no fixed rules, officials had no fixed positions, responsibilities were not divided, and the system was unclear. If the leader trusted them, they could overstep their authority; if the leader had no prior relationship with them, they would simply seek to earn a living. This is the old-fashioned bureaucratic system of the state, not the modern national system of officials. This is a temporary gathering of governance by people, not the permanent rule of law of the state. Therefore, all facilities of the government from now on must be institutionalized, so that the entire organization of the government becomes a sound function. Once launched, each department can exert its greatest and most vigilant efficiency, so that this entire function conforms to the principles of modern government administration. The important reforms that should be carried out in related systems are described below:</p>
<p>(A) The civil service system must be established. Personnel appointments must be based on talent, so that the virtuous are in position and the capable are in office. Historically, in our country's officialdom, personnel appointments were often based on relatives or acquaintances, with the likes and dislikes and closeness of the leader as the standard for personnel advancement and demotion. This has been the accumulation of thousands of years, and has now been somewhat corrected, but unfortunately it is still far from being completely eliminated. In addition to this, it seems that there is nothing more important than implementing the civil service system (also known as the civil service system) in all parts. After the widespread implementation of this system, on the negative side, it can restrict the abuse of private power; on the positive side, it can exert fairness and encourage talent. This is the great way to embrace the people.</p>
<p>(B) The powers and responsibilities of public servants must be clearly defined. In today's political circles in our country, public servants either have power without responsibility or responsibility without power. As a result, often no one is responsible for anything, and it is impossible to hold anyone accountable. In the future, powers and responsibilities should be clearly defined, so that those with responsibility must have sufficient power to match it, and then everyone can do their best, and the practical responsibility for success or failure will also have a clear source.</p>
<p>(C) The organization of agencies must be clear. One thing should never be entrusted to several agencies for execution, otherwise no agency will be willing to take full responsibility. If they cannot take full responsibility, they will clash with each other, and nothing will be accomplished. Moreover, our country's government agencies often act independently and have little contact with each other. If something requires cooperation with other agencies, it is often impossible to obtain the necessary cooperation. Therefore, the relationship between agencies must be clear to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>(3) The government system should be democratized. The aim of our country's politics should be democracy, which is a consistent requirement from top to bottom. Therefore, what is currently being discussed is not this aim, but how to achieve this aim gradually and steadily. The following methods are hereby proposed: Before constitutional government is implemented in our country, the fact that politics should be guided by the Kuomintang and that the government should be organized by the Kuomintang has been recognized by the people of the whole country and should not be changed. However, the government organized and guided by the party should still be accountable to the people. If the people express dissatisfaction with the government in accordance with the law, and the government still cannot find a way to satisfy the people, the party should make corrections or reorganizations based on the severity of the situation. The party should use the existing People's Political Council or an improved and strengthened People's Political Council with more representation of the people as a body of public opinion, and use gradual methods to give it the power to supervise the administration in accordance with the law. Whether the above suggestions are appropriate is respectfully awaiting public decision.</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Reaffirms Close Anglo-French Ties, Not a Threat to Third Countries, No Mediation Planned for Franco-Italian Dispute</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] In response to questions in the House of Lords today regarding Anglo-French relations, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on Anglo-French unity was clear and unambiguous, and that it would be a great mistake to think there were any reservations in it. "To explain it in a common analogy, the Prime Minister's declaration is like the warning sign often seen at country road corners: 'Main Road Ahead, Proceed with Caution.'" The purpose of the declaration was such. There was no difference of opinion between Britain and France on any issue, so there was no need to repeatedly state the connection between the two countries. Soon, the British people will welcome the French head of state (referring to the French President and his wife's visit to Britain in response to the British King and Queen's visit to France last year), which will be an opportunity to solemnly reaffirm the unity between Britain and France. Halifax stated, "The people of Britain and France have long considered the unity of the two countries to be beyond question, but some quarters have had various misunderstandings, so we have had to use emphatic language to clarify it. Our unity with France is not only due to geographical circumstances, but also to the convergence of interests and the similarity of views between the two countries. These factors that promote the unity of the two countries are the best guarantee of their unity. Some people believe that in certain circumstances, one country's policy subordinating to another would be dangerous, but in fact, this danger does not exist." Halifax emphasized that the unity of Britain and France was not intended to threaten third countries, and never would be. The past actions of the British and French governments and their efforts to maintain peace were enough to prove this point. Halifax then discussed the Franco-Italian dispute, saying, "In one sense, the Franco-Italian dispute has no major relationship with Britain," but in another sense, the Franco-Italian dispute has a direct and close relationship with Britain, because we have a close relationship with France, and we want to improve our relationship with Italy, and we want to do everything we can to maintain harmonious relations." Halifax went on to point out that neither France nor Italy had expressed a desire for a third country to mediate, so unless the two countries had this desire, there would be no mediation of the Franco-Italian dispute. Currently, the Italian government has not formally stated its points of contention with France. Halifax then mentioned that Britain often suffered from misunderstandings, saying, "Everyone in the world knows that there are no warmongers in the country now. We dare say that there is no party or politician in the country that advocates aggressive war, and this kind of warmongering policy cannot gain national support. However, there are people in other countries who are mistaken, they think that our hope for peace means weakness, cowardice, or lack of determination. I want to clearly state that this kind of view is completely wrong. Leaders of various governments have repeatedly stated that war is not beneficial to the victor either. This view has truth, and the people of Britain and France are familiar with it, so it is not surprising that they accuse us of using war as a tool to implement national policy. But this does not mean that the people of Britain and France are unwilling to use force to resist foreign threats to their lives, independence, and major interests." Halifax then quoted Hitler's words in "Mein Kampf," saying that the Germans had miscalculated the British Empire and its people before the last war, saying, "Our resources are still very rich, our spirit has not changed, we do not want to test our abilities, because we firmly believe that war can only increase difficulties, and any problem can be resolved through full and frank discussion. What the government hopes most is that the international situation will allow us to seek solutions to some of the problems that concern us. On the other hand, anyone who understands the British people will know that when necessary, the British people of today are as determined to defend their freedom as they were in the past."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] In the British House of Commons last night, Labour MP Mr. Fletcher asked whether the government's policy was still not to conscript a large number of infantry to be deployed to the European continent. The Prime Minister replied that the government's policy was to proceed in accordance with this year's army plan, and that the plan was drawn up in accordance with the needs of various parts of the world. Mr. Fletcher then asked how this was consistent with Home Secretary Hoare's announcement last year that we would cooperate with France if it was attacked. Chamberlain replied, "I think this question is not appropriate to discuss much in the current situation."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] According to well-informed sources and Italian newspapers, Britain is currently trying to mediate the dispute between France and Italy. It is reported that the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Noel Charles, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano have met in the past few days to discuss the adjustment of Franco-Italian relations and general European issues. The Rome People's Daily correspondent in London said that according to British sources, Sir Noel Charles and Ciano discussed the question of Italian and French territory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] The British Daily Express published news saying that Prime Minister Chamberlain wanted to mediate between France and Italy. The Carino newspaper commented that Italy absolutely does not need a mediator. The Italian people are very clear about the rights they should enjoy. If the land they should get cannot be obtained by peaceful means, then it should be occupied by force. In any case, even if Italy accepts a third party to mediate, it would rather have German leader Adolf Hitler do it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] Local officials recently announced that the sea, land, and air of the French port of Djibouti in East Africa are now defended by 3,000 indigenous soldiers, 30 aircraft, cruisers, and torpedo boats. It is impossible for other countries to take action against this port. Regarding the Italian newspaper report that Britain intends to mediate between France and Italy, local people say that Italy has been in a stalemate for three months since it abolished the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. If there is any international mediation action, it will only allow Italy to extricate itself from this stalemate.</p>
<h3>Naval and Air Bases, US House of Representatives Passes Bill to Add Them, But Vetoes Guam Fortification Bill, Congressmen Urge Attention to Japanese Ambitions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] The bill proposed by Vincent, Chairman of the House of Representatives Naval Affairs Committee, to spend $62 million to add 12 naval aviation bases in the Alaska Peninsula and the Paşama Region in the Pacific Ocean, was continued to be discussed by the House of Representatives and passed with 193 votes to 164 votes. The amendment proposed by New Jersey Democratic Congressman Satterlee to remove the clause on building an airfield in Guam from the original bill was passed by a large majority of 368 votes to 4 votes. The total cost of all other clauses in the original bill was also reduced from $53 million to $48 million. The bill will be transferred to the Senate for discussion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The bill to allocate $5 million to improve the Guam naval and air base was debated in the US House of Representatives for three days and was finally vetoed today. However, according to the rules of the US House of Representatives, the motion can still be reconsidered.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Local diplomatic experts commented on the House of Representatives' veto of the Guam fortification bill, saying that this was the first step in testing the United States' future determination in the Far East. Some officials who supported the bill said that the bill was "an answer to dictators" and believed that the vote count had been enough to prove that the United States was gradually abandoning its isolationist policy. Others believed that the Philippines should also be fortified at the same time as Guam to achieve a strategic advantage.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] When the House of Representatives discussed the national defense plan, Republican Congressman Mott said that in the days to come, Japan would attack the United States in the Pacific. He warned that the United States was in danger of being attacked by a coalition of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Congressman Wickson criticized Congress for ignoring Japan's ambitions and shouted, "Japan bombed the Panay without asking us in advance." Mr. Maas urged not to give up an inch of sovereign territory, softening day by day is endless, if an inch is lost, "the country is in danger," and so on.</p>
<p>German Newspapers Maliciously Criticize</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The German "Posen Daily" declared today, "We cannot find the face of his peace angel from Roosevelt, but only see his resentment towards communist countries." The newspaper believed that the US's increasing defense of Guam and establishing naval bases in the Pacific were all revealed to the British former Foreign Secretary Eden during his visit to the United States last December. The newspaper said, "It is unknown whether Eden's suggestion was a personal opinion or whether he was ordered to do so, but there are only two possibilities. First, whether there is a secret plan between Britain and the United States to allocate world territory. Second, whether the United States' attacks and propaganda against Germany and countries friendly to Germany are only to divert people's attention in order to promote its important policies. Which of these two is true depends on whether the Pacific naval base is indeed Eden's suggestion." The newspaper concluded, "Is it possible that the United States will listen to the words of a third country and place its hidden danger before Japan?"</p>
<h3>Leon Blum to Visit the United States Soon to Discuss the World Situation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 24th] According to reports from the Italian official news agency, former French Prime Minister Leon Blum will soon visit the United States to discuss the world situation with President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Relations Between Italy and Albania Deteriorate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] According to people from Albania, relations between Italy and Albania have recently deteriorated. Italy is now planning to occupy many Albanian ports. The Albanian government is consulting Yugoslavia and purchasing arms to strengthen its national defense. It is said that King Zog I of Albania is about to abdicate. Local political figures recently commented that when Mussolini withdraws his volunteers from Spain in the future, he may want to find a way out in a place adjacent to Italy in order to appease public opinion. If Italy takes this action, then the mutual relations between the country and Yugoslavia will definitely be extremely tense.</p>
<h3>Soviet Red Army Celebrates Army Day</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 24th] The Soviet Union held celebrations for the founding of the Red Army yesterday. All Red Army soldiers, sailors, and airmen swore to be loyal and brave to the country, obey discipline, and perform their duties with extreme caution. After each soldier and officer took the oath, they signed the oath to show their seriousness.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Orders Two Giant Cruisers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 24th] According to authoritative sources, the Dutch government has ordered two giant cruisers, each capable of traveling at 33 knots per hour. After the ships are built, they will become the largest of the Dutch warships.</p>
<h3>Japan Building Ships in Large Numbers to Compete with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Admiral Yonai to Submit New Plan to Parliament, Ship Construction Program Strictly Secret</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th] Japanese Navy Minister Yonai recently announced at a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Subcommittee that he would soon submit a new ship construction plan to Parliament to compete with the ship construction plans of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other powerful countries. Therefore, he will submit a supplementary budget to Parliament at the end of this month. Navy Minister Yonai once declared in mid-last month, "When the US Congress holds meetings, naval ship construction plans are often discussed, and all relevant parties cannot ignore this matter. Japanese naval policy is not a policy of implementing threats and aggression, but the situation may change, so the Japanese government must re-examine its naval plan." The details of the Japanese naval plan have not been disclosed. It is generally believed that even after it is submitted to Parliament, it will not be made public, because the Japanese navy has kept its ship construction plan extremely secret since it withdrew from the London Naval Conference. Since Japan is not restricted by any naval treaty, it does not have to make its naval plan public or exchange opinions with other countries. However, Japan may exchange opinions on naval plans with Germany and Italy. It is not yet known whether this new naval plan is an expansion of the "Third Naval Replenishment Plan" currently under construction or the "Fourth Naval Replenishment Plan," but its intention is obviously to increase the strength of the Third Plan. According to the Japanese naval replenishment plan, it began as early as 1930. At that time, after the London Naval Treaty, the First Naval Replenishment Plan was formulated, scheduled for three years, allocating 372,000,000 yen (equivalent to £22 million). However, this plan was not completed until 1936, with 4 cruisers of 8,500 tons, 1 aircraft carrier of 7,100 tons, 12 destroyers, 9 submarines, 1 submarine tender, 13 small ships (such as light gunboats, etc.), and 14 seaplane teams. In January 1933, the Japanese Congress discussed and passed the Third Naval Replenishment Plan, stipulating that it be completed by the end of 1936, including 1 aircraft carrier of 8,000 tons, 1 cruiser of 8,500 tons, 7 destroyers, 6 submarines, 1 minelayer, 8 mineboats and submarine chasers, and 5 seaplane teams. In July of the same year, Japan, in view of the competition among the major naval powers, further expanded the Second Plan, adding 1 aircraft carrier of 10,000 tons, 1 cruiser of 8,500 tons, 7 destroyers, and 3 seaplane teams. The total cost of the Second Plan was approximately 600 million yen (equivalent to £35 million). In 1937, the Japanese Navy began the Third Replenishment Plan and included the funds for the new five-year ship construction plan in the budget and submitted it to Parliament. This naval plan required approximately 1.2 billion yen (equivalent to £70 million), of which approximately 800 million yen or more was used to build new ships. The official secrets of the ship construction program for this plan are strictly guarded, but it is generally believed that there are 4 battleships of 40,000 tons (equipped with several large cannons with a bore of 16 inches), 2 aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., and the strength of the seaplane team is enhanced. This plan supplements the Third Ship Construction Plan that began in 1937. Japan is now striving for an unlimited naval race.</p>
<h3>Giant Boeing Plane Flies to Honolulu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 24th] The Pan American Airways Boeing giant clipper airliner, flying from San Francisco to Hong Kong, arrived in Honolulu today. The plane is worth 10 million US dollars. This is its maiden voyage. The interior is very luxurious and has a room prepared for honeymooning couples. The plane's speed is 150 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>British Colonial Supplementary Budget Debated in the House of Commons, MacDonald Requests Appropriation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] When the House of Lords discussed the £3,044,000 colonial supplementary budget yesterday, Colonial Secretary MacDonald requested an appropriation of £7,500 for the Gilbert and Ellis Islands. MacDonald explained that since the progress of air traffic in recent years, some islands that were originally unimportant will be important stopover stations in the trans-Pacific voyage. Christmas Island and Canton Island are examples of this. There are currently three such islands, and officials have been sent to each island. The £7,500 is for the salaries and office expenses of these officials. Regarding Canton Island, MacDonald said that Britain also wanted to obtain it. Now Britain and the United States have generally agreed to adopt joint management in the next few years. The two governments are now discussing all management methods in detail, and a satisfactory decision will be made soon. At the same time, both parties have representatives on Canton Island.</p>
<h3>Franco's Guarantees Satisfy Britain and France, Recognition in Two or Three Days, France to Request Confidence from the House</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Local British authorities do not believe the current widespread rumors that Britain and France will make a final effort for peace in Spain before recognizing the Franco regime. They firmly believe that formal recognition can be announced in two or three days. At the same time, as far as Britain is concerned, there is no intention to propose exchange conditions in the recognition.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Regarding the evolution of events in Spain, rapid progress has now been made to the climax. Since the French representative to the Franco government, Billard, met with the rebel general Cordara this morning, Daladier will not present the debate in Parliament, but will directly ask the House of Representatives this afternoon to express confidence in the government's legal recognition of the Franco government. It is believed that France's formal recognition can be announced on the 27th, and Britain may also hold it at the same time. Mr. Billard said that after his meeting with General Cordara last night, today's meeting has come to an end. He had obtained a good impression during his talks in Burgos. The Paris talks were only to discuss unfinished odds and ends.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] After consultations, British and French representatives believed that Franco's guarantees were satisfactory, and only some minor issues remained, which would not affect the recognition of the Franco government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] It was learned that the French Foreign Ministry sent Mr. Billard to Burgos and arrived last night. His mission was to notify General Franco that the French government had in principle decided to give the Spanish rebel government legal recognition. It was learned that the legal recognition will be implemented at the beginning of next week. Parisians believe that the British government will announce the recognition of the rebel government on Monday as well.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 23rd] According to official announcements, the Dutch government has decided to legally recognize the Franco government.</p>
<h3>New Dawn in the European Situation (Continued)</h3>
<p>The current situation is indeed much better than it was then. Especially on the issue of the Sino-Japanese War, the active attitude of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has already allowed us to say: As long as we do not compromise halfway and the puppet regime of the traitors cannot play a role, then, even if we do not talk about our own strength, just in terms of the current international environment, the fate of our resistance to Japan's defeat is now sealed. However, on the issue of the Spanish Civil War, the international trend is not very optimistic. The biggest misfortune of Spain is that it does not have a common border with the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. What borders it is France, which is led by a government with an attitude that is not very stable. In the last newsletter, the reporter pointed out the role of the Spanish Civil War in the current European situation. In recent days, the position of the government army has become more stable than before. If the international community intensifies its assistance to the government army, it will not be too late. However, according to the news we received, French Foreign Minister Bonnet believed more than a month ago that the government army had lost its momentum and began negotiations with Franco's representatives. What is the fantasy of this move? Speaking of which, it is ridiculous; that is, to win over Franco! In the past two days, the French government has clearly announced that it has sent representatives to station in the rebel capital. This is the first step in recognizing the rebel government, which is a disguised concession to Italy that has to be made under the opposition of the United States.</p>
<p>Whether the fantasy of the current French government can be realized is another matter. What is important is that on this issue, the future of the international situation is indeed tied. The German and Italian plan after the Spanish rebels completely win, as far as is currently known, is roughly: On the one hand, Italy and Germany create tension in the Mediterranean, and on the other hand, they force France to make concessions to Italy on the issue of African colonies.</p>
<p>Anyone well-informed here agrees that what Mussolini has in mind is another "Second Munich." However, the victim of this conference has changed from Czechoslovakia to France. So far, the French authorities are opposed to such a conference. When Chamberlain went to Rome to talk a month ago and passed through Paris, Daladier clearly informed him that France, in any case, opposed resolving the dispute between France and Italy through a conference, and would rather negotiate directly with Italy. In the event that direct negotiations failed and an international conference was needed, France would be willing to join the United States according to President Roosevelt's plan and hold a broader international conference to negotiate all urgent mutual disputes.</p>
<p>The glimmer of dawn that is currently appearing is whether it will finally promote the clarification of the international situation, or whether it is just a delaying tactic of Hitler's. It cannot be determined now. However, in the event that the three aggressor countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan further expand their posture of challenging the world, then the main reason will definitely be the result of the wavering of a certain part of the peace front. - We can probably say that.</p>

<h3>Bombing of Lo Wu Incident, Japan Responds to British Protest, Apologizes and Compensates for Losses, Guarantees No Similar Incidents</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] Local political circles are quite satisfied with the Japanese government's reply to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie's protest over the bombing of the Kowloon New Territories and the sincere apology. According to the contents of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's reply to the British ambassador, it has been stated that it guarantees that similar matters will not occur again, and also agrees to fully bear the responsibility for compensating for the destruction of property. This is the first time that the Japanese side has agreed to compensate for the loss of destroyed property and strictly punish the perpetrators. The British ambassador was ordered to request the Japanese government to publish the truth of the incident in the newspapers so that the Japanese people would understand the whole case, because the Japanese newspapers only reported that a warplane mistakenly dropped a bomb on the British concession (see another article on Hong Kong news in this newspaper).</p>
<h3>Mussolini's New Farce</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dong Ping from P.Lfsovsky's original work, adapted from the "Moscow News"</p>
<p>It was still last year, November 30th, when the unexpected Ciano blustered in Congress about the so-called "natural inclinations" of Fascist Italy. Italian parliament members then began to clamor and vociferously shout slogans about "Tunisia," "Nice," "Savoy," and "Djibouti."</p>
<p>This demonstration out of nowhere was obviously the start of Italy's anti-French movement, with the aim of forcing France to return to Italy some territories and European colonies that she had 'illegally' taken from Italy.</p>
<p>The performance of the first act of this "movement" was like a bolt from the blue for the British and French leaders who had just returned happily from Munich. So, the two governments jointly inquired to Rome, asking for an explanation. Ciano's reply was that the anti-French demonstrations were purely "natural" and the Italian government could not be held responsible.</p>
<p>This meant that the anti-French movement was not officially directed. However, on December 17th, the Italian government sent a note to France, proposing to abolish the Franco-Italian agreement of January 7, 1935. That agreement was signed by Mussolini himself and Laval, and was supposed to resolve colonial disputes between France and Italy. Such a notice of abolition was simply a declaration that the Italian government was now outright refusing to recognize the status quo of the colonies and was preparing to launch a struggle to redraw the colonial map.</p>
<p>Italy's territorial demands from France are not really a new trick. It's just a renewed version of an old one. Even in the period before 1935, Franco-Italian relations were frequently strained. At that time, Italy also made forceful demands for a large amount of colonial land and political rights from France. However, the current demands are significantly different from those of the past.</p>
<p>Italy's previous demands were mostly focused on the Lake Chad area in Africa, but this time they were not mentioned. Conversely, the issues of Corsica, Nice, and Savoy, which were not mentioned last time, are now all brought up. Tunisia is still placed at the forefront of the demands as before, but last time the demand was only for judicial and political rights, while this time it is a straightforward demand to possess the territory.</p>
<p>If we make a detailed comparison of Italy's demands in these two periods, it is evident that Italy's main goal now is to seize military strongholds in the Mediterranean. In reality, Corsica, Nice, and Savoy are of no economic value; however, they are extremely important militarily. In future wars, dominance in the Mediterranean will clearly depend largely on the Toulon-Corsica-Tunisia triangle defense line of France; this line will undoubtedly be much more powerful than Britain's naval bases in the central or western Mediterranean – Gibraltar and Malta. The joint activity of the British and French navies on the French defensive triangle not only controls the entire Mediterranean but is also sufficient to blockade Italy, leading to her utter defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Italy will spare no effort to sabotage this French defense line in the Mediterranean, and it is not surprising that she has now made such land claims out of thin air.</p>
<p>If Nice and Savoy are taken by Italy, they can easily be used as bases for attacking southern France. As a result, Toulon, France's key point in the Mediterranean, will be directly threatened. If Italy gets Corsica, she will be able to establish a first-class naval base in the western Mediterranean. Similarly, if Italy also grabs Tunisia, then she will be truly formidable. She can completely control the straits between the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, fundamentally cutting off the British and French naval transportation lines between Gibraltar, Malta, and Suez.</p>
<p>As for Djibouti, before the Italo-Ethiopian War, it occupied an important position in France's colonial policy as a fulcrum for expansion into the Red Sea, East Africa, and Abyssinia. Although its importance has been reduced after Italy annexed Abyssinia, it is clearly still a territory that France must fight for.</p>
<p>Today, Djibouti's most important role is as a coaling station for French ships sailing from Europe via the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. The importance of this route to France is self-evident, as it directly extends to France's most important colony in the Far East, Indochina. Djibouti is also economically important because the railway from there to Addis Ababa is the only channel for Abyssinian goods to be exported. Before the Italo-Ethiopian War, the amount of Ethiopian exports passing through there accounted for four-fifths of the total.</p>
<p>If Italy seizes Djibouti and this railway, then she will not only obtain substantial economic benefits and further dominate Abyssinia, but she can also greatly enhance her political and military position in the Red Sea. Deceiving France and attacking England are both very possible. Because once Italy dominates Djibouti and French Somaliland, she will immediately seriously threaten Britain's base in Aden. Moreover, she can use Djibouti as a pillar to compete with Britain for control of the southern gateway to the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Italy's demands regarding the Suez Canal are different in nature from the others. The impact of this demand alone is far greater on Britain than on France. Therefore, Italy does not dare to be as active in this demand as in the others. At this time, she is only demanding to jointly manage the canal with France.</p>
<p>From the above, the facts are extremely obvious. If Italy can truly obtain all these territories one by one, then the military and political situation in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea will be fundamentally broken, and she will undoubtedly become the leader of these waters. She will not only be able to break through the British and French naval blockade but can even freely cut off British and French transportation lines at any time and any place. These will inevitably change the overall situation of the future European war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Fascist Italy's anti-French movement is not her own national policy, but a product of the German-Italian Axis, used to prepare for the outbreak of a second world war, in order to fulfill her dream of redrawing the world map.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Rejection of Fortifying Guam</h3>
<p>Washington, 24th—According to reports, as a result of the U.S. House of Representatives discussing the $52 million national defense budget, the $5 million Guam fortification proposal has been rejected. This matter is likely to attract attention from all sides.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Guam fortification plan was to counter Japan's naval construction in the Pacific mandated territories and to prepare favorable conditions for future naval negotiations with Japan. At the same time, there are two indirect meanings, namely, on the one hand, to help maintain British and American Far East interests, and on the other hand, to help China's war of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected this proposal, it will certainly be disappointing, and it is also greatly contrary to U.S. interests. At the same time, it will make the recent threats of the Japanese aggressors against Britain and France even more rampant. However, we should also recognize: (1) The member of the Republican Party, Sefen, proposed to reject this Guam fortification proposal, and the number of votes passing the rejection was 205 to 168. It can be seen here that there are still quite a large number of Congress members who oppose rejecting this proposal, and the reactionary views of the Republican minority leader, who violate the interests of the vast majority of the American people, are even more obvious, and their prestige among the masses will be even lower. (2) According to the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, this rejection must be submitted to the Senate for review, and there is still a chance to reject this rejection. (3) The case of constructing naval and air force bases for $48.8 million has been passed by an absolute majority of 368 to 4 votes.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can foresee that the U.S. policy of assisting democratic and peaceful countries in opposing Fascist aggression will not change in the future. Because the United States has no other way out than this, we hope that the American people can make greater efforts to launch a life-and-death struggle with all the reactionary elements who violate this principle.</p>
<h3>Military Commission Establishes a Snitch Box</h3>
<p>In order to welcome the public to report traitors and corrupt party, government, and military officials, the Military Commission has specially set up a special snitch box in Chongqing, hoping that people from all walks of life will fully expose the bad guys, and write their real names and addresses so that they can be summoned at any time. The authorities are determined to keep all secrets, and if the information is true, they will be rewarded separately. From this, it can be seen that our authorities are determined to severely punish corruption in accordance with public opinion. This method can be promoted throughout the country. However, this method cannot be regarded as perfect. It is best to hope that the authorities can follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of the Three Principles of the People, and promote the implementation of democratic governance. On the one hand, quickly establish local assembly councils in various provinces, cities, and counties. On the other hand, refer to the village and street people's congresses that the Guangxi authorities have worked hard to promote, and the effective democratic political methods implemented in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, so that people from all walks of life can exercise their democratic rights in people's congresses and other forms of gatherings. Moreover, all corrupt officials can only lose all protection when true direct democracy is implemented.</p>
<h3>Horse Racing Tickets Sell Like Hotcakes!</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Spring Racing Season will begin today. For the matter itself, no comments will be added for the time being. But it is noteworthy that as of 10 am yesterday, the Hong Kong Jockey Club's horse racing tickets for one dollar a dozen Derby had sold more than 427,000 tickets. It is expected that ticket sales will not be difficult to exceed 500,000. The number of tickets issued this year has broken the highest record in previous years. Among the number of people who are enthusiastically buying horse racing tickets, Chinese compatriots account for a very large proportion. In this irrational society, there is no need to criticize those who are keen on making a fortune by chance, but we hope that all Hong Kong compatriots can remember the ancient lesson of "no eggs are left intact under an overturned nest," and stop pursuing personal gains and neglect the great cause of resisting the war and building the country, which is related to the eternal welfare of the country and the nation and themselves. At the very least, do not let the results of the "debt repayment movement" of the same "one dollar" fall behind the sales of horse racing tickets, so as to be a laughing stock in front of friendly people! For the peace of mind, let's enthusiastically donate to the motherland!</p>

<h3>Following the Bombing Incident in Lo Wu, British Troops in the New Territories Take Self-Defense Actions, the Scots Guard Hold the Border and Artillery Units Conduct Live-Fire Exercises, the British Government Officially Issues the Hong Kong Naval Defense Order</h3>
<p>Following the tragic bombing of the British-occupied Lo Wu by aircraft on the 21st of this month, which resulted in hundreds of casualties, the Hong Kong government authorities have not only reported the details of the violation to the British capital and lodged a serious protest with Japan, but the Hong Kong military authorities have also taken precautionary measures by specially instructing the border defense forces in the New Territories to take self-defense actions when necessary. It is reported that the Scots Guards are responsible for defending the key passes of the border, and at present, the army has complied with the order and prepared everything. It is also reported that since the Japanese withdrew from Shenzhen, the治安has been maintained by the police. Since the bombing of Lo Wu, they have been ordered to return to Fanling and Kam Tin. There are more than 3,000 refugees there, and the治安is currently managed and maintained by the police.</p>
<p>Live-Fire Exercises at Artillery Units, Second Blockade Ship Arrives in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-based army, navy, and air force have recently been ordered to conduct frequent exercises. According to sources, live-fire exercises were held at the White Sand Ring Artillery Unit at 6:30 pm and at night yesterday. The sound of artillery fire was deafening and could be heard far and wide. The other artillery units will also conduct drills during the day, and the army authorities will issue a notice at that time. In addition, in order to enhance the naval defense capabilities of Hong Kong, the British naval authorities have specially dispatched two blockade engineering ships to Hong Kong in order to blockade the port when necessary. The first ship arrived last month, and the second ship, the HMS Barrier, only arrived yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Kowloon Naval Dockyard. Not long after arriving, a fire suddenly broke out. The engineer's inner room's trousers, socks, blankets, and other items caught fire, and thick smoke billowed, filling the room. When the sailors saw this, they immediately raised the alarm. Before long, the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station heard the report and immediately dispatched police to provide assistance. However, the door of the room was locked at the time and there was no way to enter. So they broke down the door and cooperated with the crew to put out the fire with water.</p>
<p>Granting Naval Defense Rights, the British Government Issues a Formal Order</p>
<p>Recently, the London Gazette published a Hong Kong Naval Defense Order, authorizing the Navy Department, in accordance with the 1931 Colonial Naval Defense Ordinance, to entrust personnel provided by the Hong Kong government or the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force with general naval tasks. It is reported that this unit in Hong Kong was established in accordance with the 1933 Naval Volunteer Force Ordinance, and the British ship HMS Cornflower was designated as a training ship the following year. It is currently moored southwest of Jia Lidao. The current captain is Bishili. The above-mentioned order therefore authorizes the Hong Kong legislature to have the power to allow the government to maintain and use warships, and clearly stipulates that the personnel of the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force must: (1) serve on land or at sea, whether inside or outside Hong Kong. Except for the changing regulations formulated by the legislative aspect based on the Hong Kong environment, they shall abide by the current regulations of the British Navy, (2) be assigned to any ship, agency, or outside of Hong Kong, regardless of whether it belongs to Hong Kong service or training, (3) Those who perform general duties of the British Navy in times of emergency shall form the British Naval Volunteer Reserve or a part of it as the British Naval Reserve, and the rest as the British Naval Volunteer Reserve.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing the Safety of Refugees, the Hong Kong Authorities Will Negotiate with Japan</p>
<p>After the Japanese aircraft recklessly bombed Shenzhen yesterday, the refugees in the refugee camp there were all moved into the New Territories. The situation of the authorities handling the comforting affairs was announced by Secretary for Health Situ Yongjue yesterday. According to the reporter's investigation, in addition to reporting to the British government to protest the bombing of British territory by Japanese aircraft, the Hong Kong authorities are also in the process of obtaining a definite promise from the Japanese side to designate several sections of land in Shenzhen as refugee areas, so that the same incident as the previous day will not happen again in the future, so that the refugees who have now moved into the British boundary can return to their original Japanese camps and live in peace. This matter is currently under negotiation. According to sources close to official medical circles, it is said that this matter is expected to be realized in a few weeks. As for the Japanese aircraft wreaking havoc in Shenzhen, tens of thousands of refugees poured into the British boundary. The authorities opened the Fanling, North Station, South Station and Man Kam To refugee camps to accommodate them, all of which were overcrowded. In addition, other valleys have not yet been opened. According to the authorities' survey on the 18th of this month, the number of refugees remaining in the camp was 6,900, including 1,393 in King's Park, 621 in Ma Tau Chung, 1,162 in North Point, 17 in Lai Chi Kok Hospital (Chinese Army), 780 in Ma Tau Chung (Chinese Army), and 2,583 in Kam Tin, totaling 6,996.</p>
<h3>The Emergency Relief Association Allocates Funds Again to Relieve the Disaster in Huizhou, Allocating $20,000 in Fractional Notes</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Emergency Relief Association for Refugees, because of the heavy disaster situation in Huizhou, Bobai and other counties, had previously allocated a total of hundreds of packages of old clothes and wheat bran, which have been distributed almost completely, like a drop in the bucket. The members of the association's Huizhou branch committee, for the sake of continuing relief, especially the Baptist Church sent Pastor Ross Ming and the Catholic Father Bi, etc., to Hong Kong to discuss with Sheng Wei Jiali Mo and other pastors. The Hong Kong Emergency Relief Association for Refugees has now allocated another $20,000 in fractional notes to relieve the refugees in Huizhou and Bobai.</p>
<h3>Candidates for the Next Session of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, New Lineup of Directors Difficult to Produce, Only One Representative of the Insurance Industry Has Been Selected So Far, Many Wealthy Merchants Have Replied with Polite Refusals</h3>
<p>The candidates for the directors of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, one session per year, have been produced on the 14th of this month. A total of 27 wealthy merchants were selected as directors and letters of appointment were sent to them. At the same time, letters were also sent to inns, pawnshops, insurance companies, piece goods stores, foreign goods stores and other industries, recommending industry representatives to take charge of the hospital affairs. However, according to the reporter's investigation yesterday, as of now, although the wealthy merchant directors have been publicly selected some days ago, and each of them is a wealthy merchant with high expectations, some of them have already sent letters to the Eastern Hospital declining the appointment. As for the industry representatives, letters were sent to various industries to recommend them, and these letters have been issued for more than ten days, but only the insurance industry has replied to elect Lian'an Insurance Company as the representative director. There are still eight or nine other industries that have not yet produced representatives. Therefore, the formal election period is still far away. It is reported that in recent years, it has been very difficult to select industry representative directors. Therefore, industry representatives in the current board of directors only account for three, and it will be difficult to obtain a majority in the next session.</p>
<h3>Soong Ching-ling, etc., Issue an Appeal Letter, Requesting Donations to Comfort Refugees</h3>

<h3>Established Without Approval, Police Detectives Search and Arrest the Chinese Seamen's Union, Formally Brought to Trial by the Central Magistracy Yesterday, Huang Yalen and Others Charged with Forming an Illegal Society</h3>
<p>On February 3rd, British Detective Assistant Ma Fei and Detective Yilishi once led a team of Chinese detectives to search the Chinese Seamen's Union on the third floor of No. 19 Peel Street in Central, and seized many documents, including official documents, envelopes, stationery, and receipts. Three men, Huang Yalen, Liang Jiu, and Zhu Baoyan, were arrested. Afterwards, they were charged with the case. This case has been brought to court several times. It was not until yesterday afternoon that it was formally tried by He, the third court of the Central Magistracy. The three defendants all hired lawyer Shi Luhua to defend them and denied guilt. The prosecution was handled by the Deputy Attorney General of the Hong Kong Government, Williams.</p>
<p>Charges</p>
<p>The charges against Liang Jiu and Zhu Baoyan are recorded as follows: (1) It is said that the three men had committed the crime of assisting in the establishment of this illegal Chinese Seamen's Union on the third floor of 19 Peel Street around February 3; (2) It is said that the three men were members of this illegal Chinese Seamen's Union on the third floor of 19 Peel Street around February 3; The second defendant, Liang Jiu, was further charged with a third crime, saying that he was the leaseholder of the third floor of No. 19 Peel Street, and committed the crime of allowing the floor to be opened as this illegal Chinese Seamen's Union. During the court hearing yesterday afternoon, Williams from the prosecution first stated the case to the magistrate, and cited examples to explain the reasons why the three defendants were charged. After Williams finished speaking, he immediately summoned Li Qiu, the rent collector of the building owner Xiao Hanming, to testify.</p>
<p>Search and Arrest Process</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ying Yi Li made a testimony and answered lawyer Shi's cross-examination, saying that he had not seen any signs when he went to search. Later, Assistant Ma Fei testified that after searching out the third defendant's business card, Chinese Detective Hua Ming made a testimony, saying that the first defendant had reported to the Chinese Affairs Department in early January, wanting to establish this association. Yu had visited him twice, and on January 26th, the first defendant invited Yu and Guo Zhaoji to lunch on the sixth floor of the China Department Store. During the meal, the first defendant told Yu that the Chinese Affairs Department had not allowed the establishment, and Guo also said that it could be moved to Shenzhen in the near future. However, Yu estimated that the defendant would not be able to move to another place in this shortest period of time. At this point, lawyer Shi stood up to speak and defend the defendant, saying that the former Hong Kong Seamen's Industrial Union was an illegal society, but other groups may not be illegal. The current association has nothing to do with the Hong Kong Seamen's Industrial Union, which was banned by the government in the past. The magistrate then postponed the case until 1:15 pm next Friday for retrial.</p>

<h3>One Year of Service on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Zhang Rentao</p>
<p>Report on the Work of the Kowloon Community Relief Federation's Northern Service Group</p>
<p>I believe anyone with a decent memory will recall that our group – the Kowloon Battlefield Service Group – was formed in August of the year before last to participate in the sacred national liberation war of our motherland, to represent the anti-Japanese spirit of Kowloon's compatriots who refused to be slaves of a conquered nation, and especially to serve our motherland. Several dozen of us, under the leadership and with the help of Mr. Du Qizhang, a Hong Kong gentleman, organized and set off.</p>
<p>When we departed from the warm southern land that evening, crowds of enthusiastic well-wishers thronged to the Guangdong-Hong Kong pier. The songs of national salvation resonated among the masses in the colony. Mr. Ying Guan, short, sharp, and spirited, led the welcomers, shouting moving slogans: Only return when the X people are driven back! Rather bleed and sacrifice than retreat… These slogans moved us to tears. We waved our handkerchiefs, bidding farewell to Hong Kong, to this island where we all had resided for a time, amidst the singing of "To the front lines, let's unite and drive our X people out of China..." All of this, even today, a year later, still appears before my eyes.</p>
<p>Our group dared not betray the expectations of the Kowloon compatriots. From our departure from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, and all the way through Hankou to Nanjing, whether on the ship or in the train, we devoted our greatest efforts to propaganda work. In many places we passed, compatriots unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation requested to join our group, wanting to serve on the battlefield with us. However, due to various difficulties, we politely declined each request.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Nanjing, due to various objective constraints, we had no choice but to join the war training class organized by the Military Affairs Commission. Several members who had studied in Japan also participated in special training classes for those who had studied in Japan. This was in August and September of last year.</p>
<p>The training life was quite arduous. However, in order to realize our future work on the battlefield, we endured it for the time being, without any doubt. To participate in the cause of national liberation, hard work and endurance were essential. The training period was three months. However, due to the changing war situation and the tightening siege of Nanjing, we followed the war training class out of Nanjing in the dead of night on November 17th of last year (the 26th year), undertaking a forced march of more than 1,300 li. The marching life was even more painful. Regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow, we carried our own padded clothes, quilts, belongings, and a rifle and ammunition every day, walking sixty or seventy li, or eighty or ninety li. Sometimes, we even had to push handcarts ourselves. The hardship was truly indescribable. During marching breaks, we also carried out propaganda, performing plays, singing, and engaging in individual conversations... Because we were a group of Guangdong natives, we spoke "Guangdong Mandarin" with a "southern accent." The people found it difficult to understand. But this linguistic difficulty was gradually overcome through constant work. Now our northern language is "smooth sailing" and used everywhere.</p>
<p>The march ended at Jingdezhen, a famous porcelain production site. However, more than a month had passed, and we had walked more than 1,300 li. The provinces traversed on foot were Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi. On New Year's Eve of 1937, we held our graduation ceremony in Jingdezhen.</p>
<p>After graduation, we Guangdong compatriots, under the command of "two hundred outstanding cadres dispatched to the First War Zone to serve," departed from Hankou to Zhengzhou, Henan (the location of the First War Zone). In order to familiarize ourselves with the special environment of the war zone and strengthen political education, we underwent a second training, participating in the political brigade of the Political Training Office of the First War Zone. Due to the urgent need of the anti-war environment, after three weeks of training, we were assigned to various counties as "civilian movement instructors." Except for Zeng Mei and Zhuang Zhifu, who were sent to eastern Henan, most of the members of the service group were assigned to western Henan.</p>
<p>I have been in Dengfeng County, western Henan, for half a year. During my work in the past half a year, in addition to promoting the teachers of the county to organize the "Dengfeng County Teachers' Federation," promoting the people of Donghua Town and Maguchuan to organize the Cultural Circles National Salvation Association, and promoting the middle and primary school students of the county to organize the Student Federation, in the work of arming the people, because County Magistrate Liu Xiaoran also valued civilian movement work, although I dare not say that all the people of the county have been armed, but in the recent review, more than 7,000 people from the first district of the county participated in the Anti-Enemy Self-Defense Team, more than 5,000 people from the second district participated in the Self-Defense Force, and more than 5,000 people from the third district also participated. This fully proves that the people have a high degree of awareness of the war of resistance and know that participating in the organization is the expansion of power.</p>
<p>Recently, although I have left Dengfeng, and some people who do not understand the big picture are afraid that the people have organized power, due to the gradual expansion of the organization of the self-defense teams and guerrillas, these brave and broad masses will one day pick up their own guns and drive out the XX devils.

<h3>Tell Japan</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jiancun, translated from the "Smeshe" newspaper</p>
<p>Japan has quickly apologized for invading Hong Kong's territory and has also agreed to compensate for the loss of life.</p>
<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, Japan's attitude was simply dismissive, but Tokyo suddenly expressed repentance yesterday. What was the reason?</p>
<p>We know that the Japanese military issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon that was fundamentally untrue, saying that only one Japanese plane had invaded British territory and dropped only one bomb, and even lied that the Japanese consul in Hong Kong had apologized to the Governor of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In fact, the Japanese Foreign Minister only offered an apology after meeting with British Ambassador Sir Craig yesterday. Undoubtedly, its swiftness is no different from the apology to the United States for sinking the USS Panay.</p>
<p>This can prove to the world that there is such a thing as the Japanese administrative structure and its martial relations.</p>
<p>No one believes that the Japanese government needs to apologize to people forever. This is a disgrace to the civilized world, but the Japanese government's control over its navy and army is even weaker than the Shanghai Municipal Council's response to terrorist incidents. In this situation, the only thing to do is to let its irresponsible soldiers continue to fight, and the Japanese government is prepared to continue to apologize. However, in the near future, I am afraid that one day there will be an incident that cannot be resolved by an apology.</p>
<p>Although Japan has apologized quickly this time, this incident is far from over. London believes that the British government is prepared to issue a stronger ultimatum to Japan after a formal protest than any time after the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>In diplomatic terms, it can be said that if those irresponsible soldiers who truly control Japanese policy continue to infringe on our rights, Great Britain will no longer tolerate it.</p>
<p>Now is the time for Great Britain to take action. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, we hope that the British government can give Japan a public warning, just like France warned the Spanish rebels, that is to say, if it offends again, , , it is obviously not enough to just give the Japanese commander a verbal warning!</p>
<h3>Kowloon Bandits Rampant Two Robberies Occurred in Succession Yesterday Morning A Passenger Boat in the Typhoon Shelter Was Hijacked Late at Night A Farmer's Family in Kowloon Tong Was Also Visited by Thieves</h3>
<p>Two robberies occurred in the Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter and Kowloon Tong in succession from 0:00 to 3:00 yesterday morning. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo boat and passenger boat No. 5597 was robbed. Last night, it was moored in the Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter. The female boat owner, Su Daixi (25 years old), her aunt, and two children, a total of four people, were sleeping soundly in the boat. At 1:00 yesterday morning, three bandits suddenly boarded the boat to rob it. One bandit held a sword, and one bandit held a sharp blade, threatening everyone in the boat, and stuffing their mouths with orange tongs to prevent them from making a sound. They also tied their hands behind their backs with rope, and then imprisoned them in the boat. The three bandits searched leisurely for about forty minutes before whistling away. The boat owner, Su Daixi, went to the police station yesterday morning to report the case and requested an investigation. She said that she had been robbed of 130 yuan in cash, a pair of gold rattan bracelets, a ring, and clothing, totaling a loss of about 200 yuan.</p>
<p>A farmer was robbed. The farmer, Zhou Huan, cultivated for a living. He lived with his mother, Hou Jiaoxin, and his partner, Zhu Lianying, in a small house on the hillside above Kowloon Tong. At 3:30 yesterday morning, five bandits armed with sharp swords broke in to rob them, tied everyone up with rope, and then searched the house, looting 13 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 cents in cash, 29 chickens, 2 geese, and 1 duck, worth 39 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 cents. After the incident, the victim went to the police station to report the case.</p>

<h3>Frequent Freight Hong Kong Foreign Shipping Companies Plan to Increase Sailings on the Hong Kong-Burma Route to Connect Yunnan-Burma Freight and Supply Demand</h3>
<p>Since the situation in South China has changed, the maritime traffic between our country and Europe and the United States has gradually shifted from Guangzhou to the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam routes. The traffic between Hong Kong and Rangoon alone has been affected by the war. All goods shipped from Europe and the United States to China are shipped directly to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Haiphong and Rangoon, and then to Kunming. Therefore, the traffic on the Hong Kong-Burma line is becoming increasingly close, and the frequency of freight traffic is unprecedented. Therefore, the demand for smooth and fast communication between Hong Kong and Burma in the future is even more urgent. According to the shipping industry here, after the shipping in North China and the Yangtze River was monopolized by the X people, the ships that used to sail were all stopped. Therefore, shipping companies have long paid attention to the Hong Kong-Burma route business, especially British shipping companies. Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, the two companies whose ships have stopped sailing in North China and the Yangtze River, are now planning to send more ships to join this route. As for other inland river shipping companies in Hong Kong, they are also rising up to compete in order to expand their own business and decide to sail on the Hong Kong-Burma route in the future. According to news from Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies, the two companies are currently considering increasing the number of ships sailing on this route. As soon as the plan is completed, it can be realized.</p>

<h3>X Has Not Re-entered or Set Fire Nantou Is As Peaceful As Ever Customs Officer Talks About Shekou Customs Working As Usual</h3>
<p>(Shenzhen Express News) Nantou, Baoan County, was captured by 300 X people on the 17th of this month. Our army then counterattacked victoriously on the morning of the 20th with two companies of political police and recovered Nantou. Yesterday, a rumor suddenly spread that X had fallen into Nantou again, saying that 400 X people had reoccupied the county government at 6:00 yesterday morning and set it on fire.</p>
<p>The Situation in Nantou Is As Peaceful As Ever</p>
<p>After hearing this news, the reporter inquired from the Baoan authorities and learned that it was not true. In order to investigate the actual situation, he rushed to Nantou to observe the situation in the city, which was stable as ever. There was no trace of X. Only the ruins near the county government and the Wenjia Ancestral Hall, which were burned down by X that day, presented a desolate scene. The people ignored the X army's request to organize a puppet maintenance association. The X army's threat to reoccupy Nantou only slightly revealed a state of panic.</p>
<p>X Plane Throws Absurd Leaflets Again</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, several X planes flew to Nantou and hovered over the entrance of the port, and dropped absurd leaflets, forcing the people to quickly organize a puppet maintenance association and hold a puppet county magistrate election. The X planes then flew to Shenzhen and also dropped a large number of such absurd leaflets there. As for the claim that X set fire to Nantou, it is even more absurd, because there is no trace of X there. It is found that Shekou, about one mile south of Nantou, has our country's customs. The customs officers are still performing their duties as usual and have not retreated. The Baoan small boat to and from Hong Kong still opens the port as usual at noon. As for the cargo boats from Shekou to Hong Kong, they are loaded with a large number of cabbages and set sail.</p>
<p>Shekou Customs Works As Usual</p>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong, yesterday's Western newspapers in Hong Kong reported that the customs officers of Shekou Customs had retreated. The reporter of the mainland agency specially inquired about this from Pu Liecha, the Kowloon Customs Commissioner, yesterday afternoon. He replied that Shekou Customs was still working as usual. A group of customs officers was sent from Hong Kong to Shekou this morning (yesterday). The group of customs officers returned to Hong Kong in the afternoon. In fact, the customs did not retreat, and Shekou was as peaceful as ever. The newspaper report was not true. It is said that Shekou is about one mile south of Nantou, the county seat of Baoan. Most of the goods from Nantou and western Baoan to Hong Kong are transshipped through Shekou. The land is the Chinese border, and the sea is the Houhai, which belongs to the British border.</p>
<h3>In Order to Increase Administrative Efficiency, the Guangdong Provincial Government Moved to Shaoguan Yesterday Chairman Li Hanhun Has Also Served As Director of the Construction Department Gu, Director of the Finance Department, Plans to Adjust Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express News] After the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Civil, Financial, Construction, and Education Departments decided to move to Yun Guan to work together to increase administrative efficiency, it was found that the Provincial Government had moved from Lian County to Shaoguan on the 16th of this month. The remaining Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education Departments, and the Relief Committee and other agencies have also moved from various places one after another. As for the address of the Provincial Government's joint office, a certain place has been selected and will be arranged for joint office as soon as it is ready. It was found that Wang Yingyu, director of the Construction Department, resigned and was approved, and the Central Government has reassigned Chairman Li to serve concurrently. The Director of the Civil Affairs Department will be taken over by He Tong, a member of the Provincial Government. It was found that Chairman Li Hanhun and Committee Member He Tong have respectively taken over as directors of the Construction and Civil Affairs Departments yesterday.</p>
<p>[Lian Zong Express News] Gu Yiqun, Director of the Finance Department of Guangdong Province and President of the Bank of Guangdong Province, has formulated a comprehensive plan for rectifying the business of the Provincial Bank and developing finance, which will be implemented step by step. It was found that the province's finance has become increasingly stable since the authorities' adjustments, and will be able to restore the pre-war situation.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Breaks Out Between Wenchang and Dingan</h3>
<p>[Southern Route Express News] According to a telegram from the island of Hainan, after the X army captured Qiongshan, they advanced to Longfa City in an attempt to disturb Wenchang and Dingan. At the moment, our self-defense teams are fiercely fighting an ambush between Wenchang and Dingan. The X army suffered 400 to 500 casualties. In addition, the X army has recently drawn large numbers of troops from Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other places to advance on Qiongya. In recent days, X warships have been found patrolling the ports of Qinglan and Boao, with intentions of landing.</p>
<h3>County Councils Established Separately in Various Counties of Guangxi</h3>
<p>The Guangxi Provincial Authorities have recently begun military affairs in the later period of the War of Resistance, and urgently need to cooperate effectively with the people to make the military and the people into one, and achieve the ultimate goal of victory. After Director Bai Chongxi returned to Guangxi at the end of last year, he convened a military and political conference of the whole province. Regarding the political aspects of Guangxi Province, it was decided to adopt an open style and strictly implement autonomy throughout the province. At that time, it was decided that democratically elected county magistrates would be implemented in all counties starting in January of the 28th year. Due to the lack of time to handle it, the establishment of county councils in various counties was first started. After the county councils are established, the provincial council will continue to be established. After the provincial council is established, the election of democratically elected county magistrates will continue to be held. It was found that the preparation and election of county council members was to first send supervisors to each election district. The supervisors of each district were based on the scope stipulated by the original people's regiment area. Each district sent 1 supervisor. Lu Yiyao was sent to the Yulin District, and Chen Shuxun was sent to the Wuzhou District. The supervisors of Guilin, Longzhou, Baise, Xunzhou, Nanning, and Liuzhou districts have also been properly assigned. The county council members will then be elected separately, and the list will be submitted by the supervisors of each district to the provincial government for approval. It is said that the county councils of all counties will be fully established on March 1 of this year, and the provincial council will also be established on April 1. It was also found that the township, town, village, and street chiefs in Guangxi Province were all filled by cadre trainees in the past. Recently, an order was received from the Provincial Government's Appeasement Office that the qualifications for all township, town, village, and street chiefs in the province are not limited to cadre trainees. Anyone who has a reputation in the township, town, village, or street can be appointed, and each township and town is allowed to freely elect natives to be appointed, so that there will be no barriers to handling local affairs.</p>
<h3>X Builds Pontoon Bridge in Jiujiang in an Attempt to Flank Jinli</h3>
<p>[Heshan Express News] According to X in Jiujiang, in order to respond to the actions of the X army in Conghua, they are ready to move. On the 22nd, they built a pontoon bridge on the coast of Jiujiang that leads directly to Gubao in order to launch a light-armored attack and flank our garrison in Jinli. At the same time, X, who were entrenched in Makou, bombarded Jinli with heavy artillery for several days in an attempt to capture this important military point in Xijiang and invade Cangwu along the Xijiang River. Our army has been prepared for this for a long time. If X offends, we will give them a heavy blow.</p>
<h3>Traitor in Haikou Plots to Betray the Country The People Fully Understand the Righteousness Not Fooled by Mao Mou</h3>
<p>[Beihai Express News] X, who landed on Hainan Island, were fiercely resisted by our Wang troops, and have not been able to enter the interior to this day. Forced to do so, on the one hand, they telegraphed Guangzhou for assistance, and on the other hand, they used Han Hao Mao Moumou to lure the people and establish a security maintenance association in Haikou. Our local compatriots fully understand the righteousness and mostly retreat into the interior, unwilling to humiliate their ancestors. At present, there are only a very small number of people left in Haikou. All buying and selling has stopped, and the situation is like a dead market.</p>
<h3>Traitor in Qiong Captures Fushan</h3>
<p>[Beijiang Express News] The military authorities here sent a telegram to the Southern Route, saying that X troops who captured Haikou divided their troops on the 19th and went west to the township of Chenmai County, Fengying. Along the Chengfeng Highway, they passed the old county seat of Chenmai and captured Fushan. Because the road was a sandy plain, our army did not set up defenses, so Fushan was immediately captured.</p>

<h3>From Swatow to Saigon (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hua You</p>
<p>I asked him, "What does this mean?" He replied with a trembling voice, "That's for paying taxes." At that moment, I used a commanding tone and told him to place it with the items that needed to be taxed. At the same time, I searched him further and discovered that the jade ring was actually taken from his trouser leg. I scolded him a few times, and his face turned green and then red as he said to me, "Take the things and pay the tax!" Just then, a "Madame" turned her face from the right, as if inquiring about the truth. I wanted to report him, but she might not punish him, since rabbits mourn for foxes and creatures sympathize with their own kind. Moreover, the lost item had been recovered, so I followed the teachings of the sage, "A gentleman does not go to extremes," and lightly spared his dog's life. Otherwise, not only would I have broken his rice bowl, but he might have had to spend a few years in prison. Although most French people in Annam are greedy, the colonial government, like those of other countries, hates such dishonest behavior. After this farcical play ended, I took the items they deemed taxable to the tax department to hear the tax officer's instructions. I thought that those few discarded items would cost no more than a few dollars at most, but unexpectedly, it was twenty-two dollars. Because I only had five dollars with me, I had to wrap the items in the bedspread and hand them over to the Xiamen-speaking manager to be temporarily stored in a warehouse. When I went to pay the tax at half-past two that afternoon, I discovered that the small clock had been stolen. This warehouse clearly had someone guarding it, yet things still went missing. Wasn't this a strange affair? Therefore, I negotiated with the tax officer, who promised to investigate. After a while, a Vietnamese person brought it back. According to the Xiamen-speaking manager, the clock was taken by the French person who inspected my luggage. He also told me that because compatriots sometimes don't have enough money, items stored in the warehouse can be picked and chosen by the French customs officers at any time. For example, fountain pens, raincoats, woolen blankets, and hot water bottles, if they are a little better, are taken by them. By the time you bring money to pay the tax, there is nothing left for you to pay for. It is best to get a written receipt listing what items you have first, so you can hold onto the official document; otherwise, there is nothing you can do about it. But they would never give you such a receipt; they can only give you an entry permit. The weak are prey to the strong; it is truly an eternal principle.</p>
<p>When I had paid the tax and gotten my things back, I thought the procedure was complete. I announced the event that had been bothering me for half a day. At this moment, I still felt my power was too weak; one person's strength could not match theirs. But I couldn't help but declare it to them, while not wanting them to understand what I was declaring. So I abandoned the Chaozhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Annam dialects and spoke in our national language. It goes without saying that the French didn't understand, and even the "Ma Zhen" interpreters from various gangs inside couldn't understand what I was saying. When the tax officer asked the translator sitting next to him what I was saying, they all shook their heads to indicate they didn't understand. I raised my head and walked out of the gate of the baggage inspection station. I thought to myself, "You don't understand my words, and that is exactly my successful plan." After returning to the Yong'an Hotel, I handed the things over to my wife to sort out, and I went to the Chinese Consulate to find my old Yenching University classmates, Zhuo Huanlai and Shen Zuxun (note: Mr. Zhuo is the current Deputy Consul of the Republic of China in Saigon). When they heard me describe how the French customs officer forcibly took my jade ring, they were also very angry. They told me to go back and write an official letter, and then they would negotiate on my behalf. That evening, I personally delivered the official letter to the consulate. The next morning, the consulate called to invite me to come. After arriving at the consulate, Consul Zhuo introduced me to Mr. Xu Nai (note: Mr. Xu is from Zhenjiang and is currently a trainee consul) and introduced me to him. Mr. Xu asked me about the details of the French customs officer forcibly taking the jade ring and asked if I could recognize the customs officer's face. I said that I could recognize his face, but I didn't know his name. He said that as long as I could recognize the person, that would be enough. So we sat in the consulate's car and sped off to the baggage inspection station.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the entrance of the baggage inspection station, the iron gate was tightly locked. Mr. Xu handed his business card to the Arab guard, who quickly opened the gate. We walked to the tax officer, and he handed over his business card. After the tax officer shook hands with Mr. Xu and greeted him, he asked what business brought him here. At this time, Mr. Xu told him about their customs officer yesterday forcibly taking the jade ring and coming to demand it back. The tax officer retorted, "If our customs officer took his jade ring, why didn't he mention it yesterday?" After Mr. Xu heard his words, he turned around and asked me if I had mentioned it to them. I repeated the words I had said to the tax officer after paying the tax yesterday to Mr. Xu. After Mr. Xu relayed my words to the tax officer, he pondered for a moment. He seemed to remember, and finally nodded in agreement. At this time, he ordered many customs officers to come out for me to identify. When I pointed to the customs officer and said, "That's him," how pitiful he was; his face turned green. The tax officer asked him if he had taken my jade ring, and he confessed very honestly. But he said that I had given it to him, and at the same time, he pulled a Vietnamese person out to testify. Mr. Xu asked me if I had given it to him. I said to Mr. Xu that I didn't know him at all, so naturally there was no question of friendship. "Do you think I would give it to him? Furthermore, the government office is not a place for gifts. Even if I gave it to him, could he take it?" Mr. Xu, based on my words and his exceptionally proficient French and legal expertise, refuted the French officials to the point where they were speechless. Finally, they said very unhappily, "Come and get it at half-past two in the afternoon." So we were victorious. Mr. Xu told me that when I came to get the jade ring in the afternoon, it would be best to bring a few strong people with me, because he was afraid that something unexpected might happen.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I mustered my courage and went with Mr. Zhang Xiangjin, the No. 1 "Ma Zhen" of the Yong'an Hotel, to retrieve the jade ring. Although it was half-past two, the tax officer had not yet come to work. The Vietnamese person who abused his power and kicked the luggage opened the iron cabinet and took out the jade ring, asking me if this was the one. I took it in my hand and examined it, nodding to him. But he said that the tax officer had not yet come, and he didn't know if he wanted to pay the tax. "You can wait for him for now." It wasn't until three o'clock that I saw the tax officer driving into the baggage inspection station in a car. I had previously believed that the French were punctual, but now I knew that their officials were just as bureaucratic as those in our country. When the tax officer walked into his office, the one I regarded as abusing his power actually told him how precious and valuable my jade ring was, meaning that he wanted him to levy a heavy tax so that I couldn't get it back. At the time, I was thinking: if he really wanted to do that, then it would only reveal their pettiness. So Mr. Zhang also said to me: "If he wants to levy a heavy tax, then we won't bother with him and ask the consul to negotiate with them again." After hearing his lackey's words, the tax officer took the jade ring and flipped it over and examined it for five minutes before saying to us: "Pay three cents in tax." This method of his could clear his compatriots of the name of thief - they didn't forcibly take your things, it was to leave a tax! When I heard that he wanted to levy a tax, I said to Mr. Zhang that I wouldn't pay. The things were taken away by them, and now I'm coming to retrieve them, but instead I have to pay them tax, which is wrong. At the same time, I also felt that in any country, women generally cannot avoid wearing some decorations. For example, in their France, have their women never worn jewelry? When they travel to our Republic of China, do we often levy taxes on such small items? The jade ring I brought is not a commodity. This proves that I am not a merchant. In any case, I cannot pay these three cents. When Mr. Zhang heard my words, he said to me, "I dare not say that your reasons are insufficient, but you must know that our country is too weak, and when we come to their colonial territory, we must suffer a little loss. Listen to me." After he finished saying these worldly words, he took out his wallet and completed the matter.</p>

<h3>Today's Soccer Games at Happy Valley with Continuous Good Shows: South China Brothers Split to Fight Eastern and Hong Kong Club, Guanghua vs. Police and Middlesex vs. Scott are Also Expected to be Spectacular</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In this year's First Division Football League, during the five-month competition, no team has not strived to create and build its position. Until now, it has entered the important stage of the second round, and the championship issue will reach its final moment, and the date to resolve it is not far away.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the current status of each team is high or low, their courage to create and build in the past is always the same. The difference lies only in the quality of their skills and the strength of their abilities. Therefore, they are divided into two paths: creating success and building failure. The team with the high status is the future champion, and the team with the low status is the one that lags behind halfway. But no matter which team it is, it always has to avoid a blank in the score table. Even if what they get is the least, it is still a victory created with blood and sweat.</p>
<p>Speaking of the championship, it is still a mystery waiting to be revealed. However, according to the situation, the Navy and South China South are already in a transcendent position in the current standings. There is no doubt that the championship and runner-up will only be contested by these two teams. Therefore, it can be said, "Heroes of the world, only you and I, my lord." As for the Eastern, which is currently in third place, it is three points behind South China South, and its hope seems weak. However, the battlefield is extremely changeable, and perhaps in the near future, the Eastern will be able to overtake the others because of someone's success. After all, the number of successes and failures is difficult to predict. The Navy and South China South dare not guarantee that their future will be smooth sailing. Worrying about gains and losses is inevitable. If those two teams have setbacks in the future, then the Eastern will naturally stand out.</p>
<p>Let me calculate the accounts of those three teams up to now, and then talk about today's games. Readers can understand how important the success or failure of those three teams will be in influencing the overall situation by following the chart. According to the table above, the Navy not only has one more point than South China South, but the Navy has played sixteen games, while South China only has thirteen games. Therefore, the Navy's hope of winning the championship is stronger. Although the Navy still has to compete with South China South for the second time, it is uncertain who will win. But even if South China South can win these two points, it still has to win all other games in order to complete the great cause. Otherwise, I am afraid the championship will still be the Navy's. Also, based on the past records of those two teams, the Navy has only lost once to South China South, and there have been three draws. Other than that, they have won every game. South China South has ten wins, no draws, and three losses. Therefore, compared to each other, the Navy has lost fewer points due to defeats than South China South. So based on this point, I am really worried about South China South's future. As for the Eastern, because its position is slightly behind, it can only sit and watch the success or failure and take advantage of it from the middle.</p>
<p>The sensational Hong Kong-Philippines international game created a page in history in the lively scene of the past few days. Now, when I think back, I really feel that grand events do not always last. However, the soccer world in Hong Kong is always active. Today, there are multiple games in the First and Second Divisions. The opportunity for ordinary fans to seek excitement continues and will not stop completely. Look, another good show is starting today.</p>
<p>All four First Division teams are dispatched, so it is inevitable that there will be a scene of internal strife. This is the Eastern against South China Hua. These two happy rivals are meeting for the last time in this league. Let's see what kind of accounts will be settled again.</p>
<p>South China South will fight the "bankrupt" Hong Kong Club. There is no doubt that South China South will win. The battle location is the same as Eastern vs. South China Hua at the Hong Kong Club grounds, held one after another. Continuous good shows, it's up to you whether you watch them or not.</p>
<p>Guanghua is against the Sino-Western Police. This game is evenly matched and will be very interesting. The match between Middlesex and Scott will also attract the attention of the soldiers.</p>
<p>According to investigations, South China South will still use the same lineup as the one that eliminated Kowloon Club in the Silver Shield semi-finals. The military appearance is neat and the strength is extremely strong. Using this to fight the talent-depleted Hong Kong Club, the number of wins and losses can be known without waiting for the end of the war. It can also be determined that the Hong Kong Club's lineup at that time will be a mixture of Second Division players, because Skinner and Bickley have left Hong Kong and returned to England a few days ago, and Fula was injured in the chest during the international competition and was hospitalized for treatment and has not yet recovered. It is truly a case of "one leak and continuous rain." What will the "football gentlemen" of today think?</p>
<p>South China South's lineup is as follows. As for the Hong Kong Club's lineup, it is currently unknown. What is known is that it will be a combination of First and Second Division players playing together.</p>

<p>Since South China Hua's hope has been lost, the battle record has become worse and worse. Therefore, Coach Mo has decided to find a way to train up-and-coming talents for future use. Therefore, today's left-wing position plans to be taken by Tan Zhen. Tian Rongfa may also be used. Other than that, there are no major changes. The strength is still good. The Eastern will use the original lineup, driven by hope, it must be so. It seems that the Eastern's chances of victory are also very high. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>(Eastern Club)</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Miao Guohua, Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Wei Quan, Song Sheng, Liu Shizan</p>
<p>Hou Chengtou, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>(South China Hua)</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan</p>
<p>Liu Mao, Liang Bowei</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong, Lin Depu, Liu Weipei</p>
<p>Yi Zhenhui, Qu Shi'e, Liu Songsheng, Chen De, Tian Rongfa, Yang Genbao, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>The Guanghua generals are courageous in improving, and the spirit of the entire army is excellent. Although the past record is extremely mediocre, this is another issue and cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Now that they are willing to humbly seek further education, the efforts to find a way will have results. Today's battle against the Police, because the strength of both sides is similar, they can just give full play and contribute their respective skills, and perhaps the victory can be found here. The lineups of the two armies are on the left.</p>
<p>(Guanghua Club)</p>
<p>Li Guoqi</p>
<p>Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui</p>
<p>Huang Jingcong, Zou Wenzhi, Qian Chifen, Zhuo Shijin, Liang Bingjin</p>
<p>(Police Club)</p>
<p>Mai Hadi</p>
<p>Chen Guangyu, Bi Liban</p>
<p>Norf, Bi Lidun, Bai Jia</p>
<p>Mo Shi, Hou Lu, Fan Guicai, Hua Liya, Huang Wengui</p>
<p>The American military and Scott have become supporting roles in the championship stage, so the outcome of this game is irrelevant to the overall situation. But in terms of strength, it seems that the American military is slightly better, because its front line has Pearson, Su Shi, etc., who are dangerous elements, and the rear has Bi Lidi, Shi Han, etc., who are well-known defense generals. Therefore, I think that these two points will continue to be the difference, and if it is not what the American military gets, it will be a draw at most. The lineups of the two teams are as follows (Tai Sui of the Stadium)</p>

<h3>Award Ceremony for the Charity Relief Cup Volleyball Tournament Held Yesterday; Allied Forces Defeat the Champions by a Narrow Margin; The Three-to-Two Battle Was Quite a Spectacle</h3>
<p>The Charity Relief Cup volleyball tournament, organized by the Hong Kong Chinese News Reporters Association, concluded yesterday after three days of intense competition. South China University (Nanda) emerged victorious, winning the championship. The association held an award ceremony at the Paul’s Sports Ground at 4:00 PM. The chairman of the association, Huang Yu-gen, gave a brief report, thanking all participating teams and enthusiastic spectators. Mrs. Chan Chak then presented the awards. Nanda, the champion, received a large silver cup from the South China Relief for Refugees United Association. Pei Ying, the runner-up, received a large silver cup from the Women's Relief and Disaster Fundraising Association. After the awards ceremony, a commemorative photo was taken, followed by a demonstration match between the Allied Forces and Nanda. The referee was Yu Yong-can. Both teams put on an energetic performance, earning praise for their technique and spirit. Nanda initially demonstrated its champion's prowess, with Xu Heng and Huang Ding-fen utilizing a combination of smashes and blocks, while Li Fu-shen and Xiao Dian-lian provided support. They won the first set 21-14. However, their coordination faltered slightly afterward, allowing the Allied Forces to counterattack successfully, winning the next two sets 21-17 and 21-18. Nanda, not daring to be negligent, rallied and won the fourth set 21-11, tying the score at 2-2. In the final set, Nanda reverted to its old habits, making frequent errors. The Allied Forces, with Wu Hua-xiong, Zhong Hua-chao, and Liu Xi-wen at the forefront, displayed their full potential and defeated the champions 21-11. The lineups for both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Allied Forces Team</p>

<h3>Faint Evening Light as They Battle the Australian League; Philippine Team Defeated 2-1; Philippine Team Returns South by Ship Today</h3>
<p>The Philippine football team traveled to Australia by ship the day before yesterday to compete against the local league team. Unexpectedly, nine of their players were late to the wharf and missed the Tai Shan ship, which departed at 9:00 AM. Only four players went ahead. In the afternoon, the nine late players took another ship to Australia. As a result, when the fans began to arrive at 4:30 PM, they only saw the local team warming up, with no sign of the Philippine players. Many spectators had high expectations. It was not until 6:00 PM that the Philippine team finally arrived. In the fierce match, the Philippine team initially showed its strength, with Bao Sai-li scoring a goal in the first half, giving them a 1-0 lead. Three minutes into the second half, Australian left-winger Li Gu returned the favor, tying the score at 1-1. Then, as the evening grew darker and the ball became harder to see, the Australian team, familiar with the terrain, found it easier to control the game. Australian center-forward Chen Li seized an opportunity and sent the ball deep into the Philippine goal. The Australian forwards rushed forward. Wei Lan-nuo-hua managed to touch the ball, but could not stop Ji Li-lu's push. Player and ball tumbled into the net, making the score 2-1, and the Australian team ultimately reversed the defeat to win the game. The lineups for both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Australian League Team)</p>
<p>Jia Hua-lu</p>
<p>Luo Ba-du Li Bao-gen</p>
<p>Ge Lu-hua Chen Li Shi Wei-lu</p>
<p>Li Gu Luo Bi-shi Ji Li-lu Gao Li-su Xiao Luo Bi-shi</p>
<p>(Philippines)</p>

<p>Ba Qi-gao Xiang Na-di-shi</p>
<p>Hua Li-si Mo Lan-da Tu</p>
<p>Bi Zhi Bao Sai-he Wang Di-si Xia He-di-ya Li Ye-si</p>
<p>After the match in Australia, the Philippine team took a ship back to Hong Kong late that night. Yesterday evening at 8:00 PM, the South China Athletic Association held a banquet for the team at the Ying Jing Restaurant, attended by dozens of people. The event ended at around 10:00 PM. It is reported that the Philippine team is scheduled to leave Hong Kong for the Philippines on the Lan-nuo ship this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Movies and Theater</h3>
<p>Entertainment… Marie Antoinette</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette</p>
<p>This film is a great success in every way. Every scene is filled with moving romance and suspenseful tragedy. Furthermore, Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power, in their first collaboration, exquisitely portray the tragic fate of a French queen. Their acting in the film reaches the highest peak of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer plays an Austrian princess full of enthusiasm and hope, who unfortunately marries the intellectually dull Louis XVI. Disappointed, she indulges in a life of luxury and excess, and falls in love with the Duke of Axel Fersen. However, she ultimately fails to gain the understanding of the people due to her waste of national funds and indulgence in desires, as well as Louis' incompetence, which leads to widespread poverty and the outbreak of revolution. In this tumultuous era, her extremely tragic fate is created.</p>
<p>The film vividly brings this moving historical event to the screen. The sets and costumes are also extremely magnificent. At the same time, the film provides a very realistic depiction of the queen's extravagant life, the environment that shaped her character, and the situation of the French Revolution at the time, further enhancing the film's authenticity. This "Marie Antoinette" is a work highly worth recommending to the audience.</p>
<p>"艷妻扮婢記" ("The Glamorous Wife Posing as a Maid")</p>
<p>A hilarious and crazy romantic comedy. The story is quite interesting, depicting a marriage full of jokes. Remi Land plays an American athlete who returns from Paris with his newlywed wife, but in order to save his father from bankruptcy, he has to feign an engagement with the daughter of an old shipping company boss. Unable to accommodate his wife, this new bride has to temporarily hide her identity from her mother-in-law and father-in-law and act as a maid, resulting in many jokes in this special situation.</p>
<p>The leading actress, Olin Bairelina, plays this humorous and lively role, which suits her personality very well. Her performance in the film is satisfactory. Remi Land's acting is also wonderful and interesting. The director handles the film in a very light and lively manner, making it a great work for entertainment.</p>
<p>Oriental… "惡霸橫行" ("Racket Busters")</p>
<p>Racket Busters</p>
<p>The first half is rather dull, but the second half is quite tense. Overall, it is still a good film in the "gangster education" genre. Humphrey Bogart, known for playing thugs, gives a subtle and detailed performance here. George Brent is also good. Allen Jenkins plays the inherently comical role well. Gloria Dickson is completely redundant and unnecessary.</p>
<p>Dahua… Beau Hunks</p>
<p>Beau Hunks</p>
<p>Cathay… Little Miss Broadway</p>
<p>Little Miss Broadway</p>
<p>Shirley Temple is undoubtedly recognized as the most popular "little singer" on the screen right now. Having her star in this film is, of course, a shrewd business move by 20th Century Fox.</p>
<p>As for the plot, it's the same old tired formula, extremely superficial and vulgar. The only watchable scene is when she leaves the orphanage and separates from her friends. The rest is quite disappointing.</p>
<p>Shirley has grown up a bit. Thanks to the Hollywood film merchants, she has developed a "grown-up tone," of course, a "Hollywood-style" grown-up tone. The genuine innocence of a child is not left much, and soon, it is believed that even this will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The song and dance are passable, but the scenes are not grand. The last scene, the "courtroom theater," is also unremarkable.</p>

<h3>On the Literary Quality of Correspondences</h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>The main function of correspondence is to quickly report on all aspects of social reality and dynamics. What differentiates it from ordinary news is that it not only bears the task of reporting on factual events, but also the higher task of improving the reader's literary cultivation and ability to understand social reality. Therefore, it occupies a very respected position in newspapers.</p>
<p>For such correspondence, we cannot but emphasize its literary quality. It must be written artistically by the correspondent; in other words, a correspondence should be a piece of reportage, because reportage is precisely about quickly reporting on all aspects of social reality and dynamics. For correspondence to be welcomed by readers, it must have literary techniques.</p>
<p>"I don't have enough refined skills yet, so I can't write novels, so I'll write reports first." This is mistaking reportage for something inferior to novels, and in particular mistaking reportage as "naturally" being technically inferior to novels; such misunderstandings, as reflected in works, are sloppy writing: this is the serious instruction that Mr. Mao Dun gives us.</p>
<p>And in the minds of writers, there is an even more serious mistake, which is mistaking correspondence for something inferior to reportage, and in particular mistaking correspondence as "naturally" being technically inferior to reportage; such misunderstandings, as reflected in works, often result not only in sloppy writing and a lack of editing, but also in a lack of content!</p>
<p>Therefore, this misunderstanding must be quickly corrected. The difference between correspondence and ordinary news lies in the presence or absence of literary quality. Correspondence without literary quality is simply the deliberate lengthening of ordinary news. For newspapers, it is not only "naturally" unable to obtain a respected position, but can even be said to be an "obstacle" that hinders the layout.</p>
<p>Nowadays, general correspondences tend to be the correspondent's "travelogues," richly decorated with descriptions of scenery or scenes with great people. In short, they are so-called "beautiful sentences": but this is only the outer garment of literature, and not the literary quality that we mean. What we mean is: the writing of correspondence must be governed by general literary principles.</p>
<p>For example, in a place, what we hear and see is a very complex set of phenomena. Which ones do we report? This requires selection. In an event, which points do we report and which points do we omit? This requires editing. How do we report the selected material vividly and realistically? This requires the technique of "imaging."</p>
<p>This is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that we need to have a correct viewpoint, and strive to find the connections between various phenomena and the causes and effects of various events in the social upheavals. With a correct viewpoint, the selection and editing mentioned above will be effective. A simple correspondence, she must also "have the ability to see the general from the specific, and the whole from the individual." This is mainly what we mean by "literary quality."</p>
<p>Current general correspondences all show that the correspondent's work is not deep enough, their ability to grasp reality is poor, and their literary techniques are lacking. From the correspondences, we only see reports of isolated phenomena, descriptions of trivial facts, and abstract records. For example, reporting on the dynamics of the people in an area after a robbery is: "Since the × people withdrew from ××, the people in the city and various villages have returned one after another. Although they see the broken walls and have no home to return to, they do not show pessimism or resentment, but instead strengthen their determination to resist the war. Now those whose houses have been burned down are mostly living in temporary thatched huts. They are holding their teeth, determined to regenerate on their own strength, and engage in the work of resisting the war,..." Such correspondence is simply too far from literary quality. Therefore, it is impossible for him to make readers gain a sense of reality, and even less to improve literary cultivation and cognitive ability. The war of resistance has promoted the development of correspondence in newspapers, and only newspapers can publish a lot of correspondence. The fact that all correspondence can be literary constructs the fully developed form of reportage. This constant appearance of accurate and vivid reports of social reality and dynamics will improve people's understanding of reality, their concern for social reform, and the strengthening of practical life; at the same time, it has also built the foundation for the high development of literature. We emphasize that correspondence should have literary quality, and it has this great significance.</p>
<h3>The Essential Elements of New Literature</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>Once it comes to the realistic school, literature focuses on the exploration of life issues; it overthrows the playful attitude of literature for the sake of literature. The purpose of problem-oriented literature is to promote ideas, instill knowledge, and cultivate character, so as to educate the masses. It is merely using the essence of literature. Therefore, whether it is a work of naturalism or neo-idealism, or the anti-Japanese war literature that the teachers urgently need, it must be truly beneficial to life. New literature is a powerful weapon to instigate revolution, and in addition to being upright in its doctrine, there are three important conditions that are worth noting.</p>
<p>First, it must have the power to agitate. New literature must, of course, have a demonstration, but more importantly, it must have the power to inspire readers. It must not only tell readers what to do, but also make readers unknowingly follow the prompts and implement them step by step. There are many sacred precepts and maxims of sages in the world, but they are coldly left in libraries and have nothing to do with the world, because they are static and dead. New literature should be alive and dynamic; this requires the author to embrace passionate feelings and write truly and thoroughly in order to deeply touch readers and make them active. Negative exposure methods also have a considerable place in new literature, but they must also contain the power of agitation, so that readers will involuntarily feel angry and go to eradicate those ugly things.</p>
<p>Second, it must have a good influence; the words and sentences of classical literature are very beautiful and pleasing to read, but for readers, they can often only give some vague impressions. Romantic literature, although enthusiastic and easy to like, focuses on emotional provocation, and often lacks concrete prompts for proper life issues. After making people praise, they just feel fluttering and at a loss. Some people are good at rhetoric and write in a fanciful way, and some people are good at catering to psychology and speak eloquently. This can be said to be a considerable success for the author personally; but as far as the impact is concerned, it is not necessarily beneficial to society, or even harmful. New literature must be able to have a good influence. In addition to having the passion to encourage, it must also have a proper prompt. The so-called criticism of life and guidance of life are necessary conditions for new literature. Whether it is said explicitly, implicitly, or reactively, it must be able to have a good influence.</p>
<p>Third, it must be able to liquidate a powerful effect; there are some works that can have a good influence on some people, but it is limited to accidental opportunities and the effect is not great. This is due to the lack of universality. There are some works that can have a good influence on people with abundant knowledge, but the general public who have not received much education cannot understand them, and the effect is not great. This is because it has not been popularized. New literature must have universality and must be popularized. Taking the masses as the target, it is always necessary to prepare to get a powerful effect when it is liquidated.</p>
<p>Among these three essential elements, the relationship of "influence" is the greatest. "Liquidation" only has the problem of the size of the effect, and "agitation" only has the relationship of whether the effect can occur. If the impact is not in line, it will be harmed instead, so the relationship is the most important. Then, when we estimate the value of a work, we must not take the superficial words as a prerequisite, but we must carefully examine its intention and judge what influence will occur.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Let us shoot the night dead with a gun!</p>
<p>Let the fragrance of gunpowder replace the fragrance of violets!</p>
<p>Let all the flowers and plants wither under the hooves of horses!</p>

<p>Sing until the dark night of Asia shines!</p>
<h3>Liujia Pond</h3>
<p>— Hen</p>
<p>The reeds of Liujia Pond have been cut, leaving only short sections of roots. If a strong wind rises, the waves in the pond always want to submerge them; but, when the wind stops, the water is still the water. The roots of the reeds are still the roots of the reeds.</p>
<p>Every day, as usual, there is a fishing boat parked on the shore of Liujia Pond. And every day, as usual, two or three soldiers in yellow uniforms always circle around the place where the fishing boat is parked at Liujia Pond.</p>
<p>It was getting late this day, and the sun was about to climb to midday. The fishing boat was moving on the ripples of Liujia Pond, and an old man, bending forward and backward, was rowing the oars. The boat was slowly approaching the shore. Strangely, a soldier in a yellow uniform was already standing at the place where the boat stopped every day, and when he saw the fishing boat rowing over from the ripples of the pond, a look of joy appeared on his face.</p>
<p>As soon as the fishing boat approached the shore of the pond, the soldier in the yellow uniform immediately jumped on the boat, looked around the boat with sharp eyes, and the joyful face temporarily changed to a dead color; then he looked at the fisherman who was rowing, and the fisherman also looked at him.</p>
<p>The soldier in the yellow uniform.</p>
<p>"You," the soldier in the yellow uniform pointed at the fisherman, and then made gestures of length, lack, can jump, things in the water, and then said: "Have or not?"</p>
<p>"Yes," the fisherman lifted the cabin board under his feet. Some water was poured inside, and you could see four or five carp writing in the water cabin. When the soldier in the yellow uniform saw it, he changed back to his original joyful look.</p>
<p>The soldier in the yellow uniform stepped from the front cabin of the boat to the fisherman, squatted down his short body, picked up the carp in the cabin with his hand, raised his head and looked at the fisherman's face and said: "Heart, heart" and continued to use a rope, one, two, three... tied together, the fisherman looked at him, understood the smile in his heart, and lightly moved the oars in his hand, the fishing boat left the shore.</p>
<p>The fishing boat was more than twenty feet away from the shore. The soldier in the yellow uniform was still busy tying the fish, not knowing that the boat was close to the center of the pond. The fisherman looked at the shore and saw no other soldiers in yellow uniforms, so he gritted his teeth, used the strength he used to tear the fishing net, and lifted the strange soldier squatting on the boat, and threw him into the water. Fish and soldiers fell into Liujia Pond together. Extremely large waves rose on the surface of the water, and the fishing boat kept rocking.</p>
<p>The fisherman saw that the water surface was calm and wavy, and with a smiling face, he steered the boat away from Liujia Pond.</p>
<p>The sky was starting to have strong winds, blowing up giant waves, washing over the roots of reeds, splashing white foamy water. Liujia Pond is always like this: after the wind stops, the water is still the water, and the roots of the reeds are still the roots of the reeds. But this time, a yellow thing floated up, half of it on the roots of the reeds, and the other half in the water.</p>
<p>Since that day, the shadow of a fishing boat in Liujia Pond has not been found. On the shore, the soldiers in yellow uniforms were not seen either.</p>
<h3>Street Corner Story</h3>
<p>— Tieguang</p>
<p>I stood on the street corner looking at the newspapers on the newsstand, to see if there were any eye-catching headlines. A tabloid seemed to be deliberately exposing its attitude more vividly during this Lunar New Year's Day, in order to attract the attention of more pedestrians taking a break during the holiday. However, most of the pedestrians relaxing during the New Year are outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, or at least they can be said to be good people who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. Therefore, even though this tabloid used large characters to mark the following title—Domestic Peace Has Great Opportunities After the Japanese Occupation of Hainan Island; however, no one paid attention. This also only shows that shameless theorists and literary vagrants who advocate peace and compromise, and surrender, have not become extinct. So, I went and asked the news vendor, "Does this tabloid sell well?"</p>
<p>The news vendor sitting on the ground shook his head and said to me with some displeasure: "It doesn't sell even three copies a day. I didn't want to sell it, but they insist on delivering it."</p>
<p>Enough, this loyal news vendor has given us an accurate report. This is what I encountered at around three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the evening, I reappeared on a street corner among more than a hundred lower-class people who were also celebrating the New Year, listening to a storyteller who was very spiritedly narrating a story.</p>
<p>I carefully listened to every sentence. What he was telling was no longer those stories from ancient books, those stories of conquering the East and conquering the West, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or Generals of the Yang Family. Instead, he clearly and explicitly combined the conspiracy of the Japanese invaders and the facts of Wang Jingwei's telegrams into a very engaging story. None of the more than a hundred listeners felt bored.</p>
<p>I am amazed by the storyteller's cleverness, and I admire his ideological consciousness even more, as he has cleared away the dross of the old content of his storytelling in this great battle for national liberation.</p>
<p>I felt a great sense of joy. My joy is not only because the storyteller can use old forms and new content to win the sympathy of the audience, but mainly because he can dare to satirize and expose the pathetic and shameful nature of the peace movement of the national traitors, which is also a good answer to the sensational headline of that tabloid that I saw during the day.</p>
<p>So, I felt that celebrating this Lunar New Year still had some flavor. Although I didn't get to eat chicken and pork, I still felt like I had eaten New Year's chicken and New Year's pork after hearing the storyteller's story.</p>
<h3>The Solidarity of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on the National Crisis, No. 2</p>
<p>The solidarity of the Chinese people has always been somewhat lacking compared to that of Europeans and Americans. Foreigners compare us to a heap of loose sand. We don't need to argue too much, we should just use this saying to warn ourselves. Because the most obvious place is the structure of the social economy, which does not closely connect the lives of all Chinese people. Instead, each place can almost achieve self-sufficiency and does not need to rely on the supply of another place to exist. Like the War of Resistance, it has been going on for so long, and many areas far from the front lines, apart from the impact of conscription, are still the same as in peacetime. To unite and resist insults under such living conditions, a great deal of propaganda effort is necessary.</p>
<p>Thank you to the × people's airplanes! If they didn't drop bombs in the rear, threatening every Chinese person with death and burning, I believe that the spirit of the Chinese people's united resistance to insults and the anger of shared hatred against the enemy would not be so strong, so fierce! Because in the rear, any touching propaganda, any alarming slogans, are not as profound as a destroyed house, a bombed corpse! In short, the spirit of our Chinese people's united resistance against Japan is constantly increasing, and in some places, we cannot but give credit to the Japanese bombers.</p>
