<h3 id="c1">略論偽「華興銀行」 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本嗾使華中僞組織和日本各銀行合組的「華興銀行」，已於日前在上海宣佈成立，並傳即將發行僞鈔，用以奪取現在日軍佔領區域內流通的中國法幣。日本爲破壞中國戰時金融，和實現她所謂「日圓集團」起見。去年曾用所謂「聯合準備銀行」的名義而發行僞「聯銀」鈔票，現在這種僞鈔的價値，正在銳跌之中。據最近路透電訊，華北僞鈔掉換法幣，升水已達百分之三四，五。以彼例此，不難覘知所謂「華興銀行」的前途。</p>
<p>一個國家的貨幣制度，要建立起來固然非常艱難，要破壞它也是很不容易。以中國法幣制度基礎的穩固，和全國人民愛護國家的忠貞，日本任何金融上的陰謀，决不會獲得意外的收穫，這已由華北僞鈔的失敗得一鐵證；並且日本於中國法幣制度的破壞，這祗是一種企圖，實際上絕無那種能力。華北僞鈔的失敗，是有準備其名而無其實，以致無從取得外匯。這次卽將發行的華中僞鈔，當然也是無所謂準備的。或有人以爲將用日圓爲準備，但日本國內的紙幣發行額，去年底已膨漲到二十九億圓；紙幣的準備金，大部分巳消耗於軍需品的購買。若果華中僞鈔以日圓爲準備，間接的就是加速日本紙幣的膨漲，或有人以爲將用外鈔爲準備，但在目前各民主國家的反侵略運動進行中，誰願負擔帮助侵略的責任？現在日本在國際間的信用，不要說毫無保證的支持的中國僞鈔的借欵，不會有着落；就是所謂實業建設的借欵，在日本現時排斥在華歐美權益的政策下，也早已封閉了告貸的門戶。據傳去年僞滿曾向美國商借一千萬鐵路用具放欵，也遭受美國方面的拒絕。或有人以爲將以僞鈔掉法幣，而以法幣的準備爲準備，這雖是日本的希望，事實上却極渺茫，因爲中國政府對於外泯，久已加以極嚴格的統制。或有人以爲用輸出商品的外滙，可以作爲準務，此事雖有可能，但是望梅何能止竭，所謂眞正的準備，除却日本軍人的手槍和利刃還有甚麽呢？</p>
<p>其實日本何常不知道：現在華北的僞鈔，旣不能破壞中國的法幣制度；將來的華中僞鈔，還不是和華北的僞鈔一樣，絕對沒有和中國法幣對抗的能力。但是日本在目前民窮財盡的時候，爲了妄想要達到創造東亞新秩序的幻夢，却不能不採這種發行僞鈔的辦法；所以日本嗾使僞組織逐漸擴大僞鈔發行的範圍，絕不是替僞組織建立什麽貨幣制度的基礎。僞鈔的發行，對於僞組織的關係，最多不過是現在日本在經濟上無力接濟的時候，僞組織可以在軍事佔領區內借一筆經濟的血債罷了。日本眞正的目的，乃是想假藉日圓集團的利便，一方面盡量削剝中國各遊擊區域內人民的血汗，以爲對華作戰的暫時的支持；一方面以僞鈔爲根據而統制外匯，極力排斥歐美在華的一切權力。</p>
<p>現在僞鈔在中國遊擊區內所具有的唯一作用，就是便利對日貿易：卽在中國遊擊區內，用僞鈔來强制收買貨物，轉運出口，取得外匯，加以統制；出口的商人必須把外匯售給僞銀行，進口商人必須事先取得外匯的供給，這在華北卽是如此辦法，如去年日本對華北的貿易，無論進口出口，都較前年增加一倍；同時還可以利用日本所不需要的中國商品，去換取日本軍事上所需要的各種原料，如華北僞「聯銀」所訂立的所謂具有優先權的入口貨物表，最先供給外匯的完全爲日軍的用品，相反的歐美其他各國對華北的貿易，進出口商品不是遭受日本限制，就是毫無利益可圖，於是貿易額都大減而特減，日本現在爲獲得更多的原料和更大的市塲，並爲着更積極的排斥歐美各國在華的權益，自然是要把僞鈔發行的範圍擴大到華中區域來。</p>
<p>中國政府對於日本這種的企圖，事先本已有了預防，禁止內地和游擊區域間貨物的自由流通，戰區地方金融的改善，和整理，以及游擊戰士對於使用僞鈔者的嚴厲處置，這都是對付日本發行僞鈔的有效辦法；因之這次日本企圖在華中發行僞鈔，對於中國法幣的破壞能力，自是有限得很。就目前實際情形而言，將來華中僞鈔的流通，總不外日本武力直接控制的幾個較大的都市，而遭受巨大影響的，當爲生活在這些區域內的中國人民，和經營華中區域對外貿易的歐美僑商，尤其是後者，將有遭遇到和華北同樣環境的可能，這是歐美在華僑民所應當特別注意的。在僞華興銀行成立的時候，據說上海中外銀行及錢莊業，决定不與合作。這是上海中外人民，爲了保全他們自身在華中的經濟利益必然的辦法。</p>

<p>— 李希　本報特稿</p>
<p>（一）×機侵犯法國安南領空的反響</p>
<p>四月十三</p>
<p>在河口附近　落歌亞航空公司的第十九號郵機的時候。聞曾侵入法國安南領空，此地法人對於這事頗表憤慨。目前他們對法國的遠東外交政策的軟弱無力，表示不滿意的也日益多起來了。有一個法國朋友吿訴我們說：這裏的法國少壯軍人，鑒於日本的屢次壓迫，旣然佔領海南島，暴風雨羣島，近更變本加厲，公然侵犯法國安南的領空，因此而對日主戰的也頗不乏人。最近法國的駐越艦隊的一個髙級軍官某某，就是代表這種意議而力主實行對日作武力報復行動的一人。可是這在當前的生國，當然是不可能的，因此他被目爲過激份子而在最近調到別處去了。從這點我們也可以看出：目前法國雖則要比較敢於走上反對侵略的道路，然而，究竟還是很有限度的。</p>
<p>（二）安南總督府的政治部長他調</p>
<p>廿六（？）日本地的各報都登載了安南總督府的政治部長格朗　（M．m．Grandfean）調囘歌洲的消意。我想遺個消息也許頗値得我們的注意。據我們所知，這個政治部長是此地的一個有名的「恐日病者」。聽說當我們前年上海『八一三』抗戰爆發的時候，他曾奉命前往上海攷察戰事，後來他囘到安南做了一個報告，那大意是說日本的機械化部隊怎樣非常厲害，士氣又怎樣旺盛，軍紀又如何良好之類的描述，總而言之，就是他對日本的成風，表示五體投地的佩服。至於中國呢，他說簡直完全不行，不但武器陳劣，而且漫無組織，卽有些新式的機械化武器也多不能使用，看見×人來了，便只好丢下機械而「逃之夭天』因此，他主張爲了保存法國的遠東利益，必須對日妥協云云。他這一報吿便作了法國一個相當長期的對日妥協政策的根據。我們姑不批評他的無視淺識的可笑。且說安南在這個政治部長的領導下面，當漢廣失陷之後，只輕輕受了日本的幾句大言威嚇，便卽實行封鎖中法的邊界，而停止了滇越鐵路對我國軍火的運輸，他們企圖以對日妥協退讓的政策而取得暫時的苟安。然而事實却完全不然。日本反而得寸進尺地佔據了海南島，法屬暴風雨島，甚至於公然後犯法國的安南領空。這些事實完全粉碎了Grandjean的近視主張。當此英法美蘇等國的反侵略陣綫運動正在日益活躍，且近於逐步完成的時候，法國便把這位老先生調回歐洲，想必對于法國的整個外交政策的變化不會毫無關係的吧？</p>
<p>（三）法報載我國駐西貢領事為×的新任秘書</p>
<p>日前本地的La　Vonlonte　Indochinoire法文報曾記戰說曾××死後，×××的私人秘書一缺，由現在我國的駐西貢領事某某接任云云。後來又聞人傳說謂該領事昔日留學法國時聞甘接受×之個人津貼，今日出此，或非不可能云。以上的記載和傳說關係甚大，未知是否眞確，假如不是事實，我們以爲該領事則應卽公開登報聲明，以正視聽；同時也還希望我國政府立郎切實調査此事，藉知眞假，而定處理。</p>
<p>（四）某公務員在越的貪污行為</p>
<p>我國自從武漢廣州相繼淪陷，國際通路轉移到安南以來，我國的各種軍政關機跟着也就有許多在此設立了辦事處，而許多公務員亦到這裏來了。我國派在這裏服務的公務員，能够廉潔自持，奉公衛國的固有其人，但不能令人滿意的亦復不少。當地華僑目睹在此地的公務員任意出入舞廳，妓院，酒館的奢華糜爛生活，每表示無限憤慨，我們覺得這種現象，是丞待糾正的。因爲華僑股能熱心愛國，實爲我國當前抗戰的一種主要動力，我們萬不可使他們有所失望，而降低了甚至於取消了他們的愛國熱情，最近記者聽一個此地有名的華僑某先生說，據聞有一個公務員到河內某洋行去買一部舊的ford汽車，價錢銳好了二千五百元，但該公務員却硬要該行的辦事人在發票上寫作三千五百元，弄得該行莫明其妙，表示不願尤諾之意；那公務員卽聲色俱厲的說道：『如果你們能够按照我的意見而行，那麽我還可以替你應買三部；否則我當卽刻到別處去交易，連這裏的一部也不要！』這樣一來，當然再沒有什麽問題，該行爲　綫起見遵命照辦就是。據說這消息是很眞實的。類此事件記者尙多所聞，譬如公務員爲了要貪污使無人舉發，不願意和華僑交易，而多數情願出髙價去和洋人做買賣，這就是一個很好的例子，我們以爲這些事件姑不論其是否確實，但願祈望我們的公務員皆本『有則改之，無則加勉』之意，轉而替我們創造出許多非常名替的，光榮的例證，使一新此地華僑的耳目吧！</p>
<p>（五）×人陰謀下之華僑與安南人的摩擦</p>
<p>前兩個多月吧，記者曾看見我國駐河內綫領事署發出的一個勸吿華僑勿與安南人多生是非，以中×人挑撥　間，破壞我們抗戰的文件。聽說近來河內海防當地華僑仍未能完全避免與安南人發生口角打架之類的糾紛，這眞是一件莫大的憾事！這些糾紛之起在表面上也許是由於安南人的過錯，然而，我們的華僑，卻應該本我們今天祖國的抗戰必須極力爭取外援之宏旨，而戒一切之意氣，古人說得好：『小不忍則亂大謀』，何況這些糾紛在實質上竟是出自一員的鼓動挑撥呢。僑胞們，我們不要　　！的當！我們應當多多爭取安南人的同情，在雲南的越僑和這裏的安南人不是都有過捐欵助我抗戰的事實嗎？據記者所聞，還有安南人自動向我們報吿×人的情報，尤其是安南的共產黨員，因目睹　　收買越人司機在越境內替我們駕駛運輸汽油的時候，每暗中倒掉或賣掉汽油。而自頗替我担任監督之責，　　些事　是何等地令我們感動的啊！至若他們口頭上的對我同情，對日仇恨，猶其餘事。</p>
<p>然而，不幸尙有更其令我們痛心的事！據報載在離海防七十基羅米特（每一基羅米特約合我國一·七里）東北角的一個叫做紅給（Hougay）的地方，最近也發生了一件很大的華越糾紛的事件。紅給是一個礦區，礦工大部份是安南人，華僑也有一些。其地鄰大海，爲軍事上一形勝之地，聽說設若將來×人進攻安南的北面，則那裏是雙方勝負得失必爭的地方之一，因此，×人在那裏非常的活動。這一次的糾紛，聞是由于華越兒童的打架，後來華人的父母對己童表示偏祖，曾輕打越童，於是越人礦工卽糾衆向華人鬥毆，而當地華人亦即羣集與之衝突，其參加人數且達千餘人之多、後來幸賴警方彈壓、及捕雙方若于人，乃止。以一小小事件竟擴大至如此模規，實非偶然之事，其背景必爲×人所陰謀挑　，是可以斷言的！獨惜我們的華僑竟蒙昧無知，致中×人之毒計！記者寫至這裏，覺得這些事情殊未可等間視之，亦决非綫領事之一紙公文可以奏效，而必須希望我們當地的僑團曁救亡的靑年工作者能够多多出來進行這類的宣傳敎育，揭穿×人挑戰的陰謀，作一個有計劃的運動，方可停止這種摩　形勢的繼續發展。記者至此，不禁要再向我們的華僑疾呼一句：僑胞們，我們不要上×人的當啊！</p>
<p>（六）關於最近海防的募捐畫展</p>
<p>有黃某的畫家，最近在海防華商會舘舉行個人的晝展，大賣其畫，每張畫的標價動輒數十元，且有髙達六十元者！然論其畫的內容，則無非畫是描寫風花雪月，鳥獸草木之類古色古香的舊畫，宣傳風雅誠有餘，鼓動救亡則不特不足而已，且直是無從談起，那麽爲什末還能大賣其畫呢？原來據說每張畫的牧入所得，除用費之外，是要拿一半捐給政府抗戰的。他利用僑胞的愛國熱情，故能大賣其畫。有個華僑某先生對我說：假如他把一張值錢十元的畫，標價六十元，賣出了，捐三十元給政府，他豈不是還發了二十元的國難財嗎？我說：你這『幽默』我不知道，只有畫家曉得！</p>
<p>（七）×人對華僑的宣傳工作</p>
<p>×人最近曾由廣州挨家逐戶的寄宣傳品給海防，河內的僑胞，（想必他處也有），不但街道門牌店號，絲毫無誤。卽連店東的名竿也有寫淸楚的！書的是什麽呢？『廣州民聲日報』，『華文大阪日報』，『華南書報』，『鷺江畫報』，『遠東月刊』——昭和十四年二月一日發行——等等。尤其引人注意的，是用專紙單張印行的『汪精衛最近的重要言論——舉一個例』的腐臭文章，『廣州民聲日報』鄭重轉載之外，且特作社論曰：『粉碎主戰反和者的迷夢』，由此，我們一面可知×人宣傳工作之週密，一面可知×人求和用心之迫切，他想藉此動搖我們華僑的抗戰熱忱，誰知事實却完全出其意外，華僑收到了立即便將撕毀，連看也不願一看，甚至有些還對郵差說，這東西不是我們的，拿囘去吧，他們連拿也不願一拿呢，爲了保存他們愛國的熱情的變手的潔淨！</p>
<p>一九三九，四，廿八於河內。</p>

<h3 id="c4">德國準備着襲擊 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 塔布衣夫人作</p>
<p>從研究戈林和戈培爾出國的任務中、我們將得到不祥的結綸、</p>
<p>戈林正凖備着一種向民主國衆的襲擊、一種由柏林、羅馬、東京、布爾哥斯陣線展開的襲擊、</p>
<p>戈培爾則準備一種對戈林計對的推進、那便是說、希特勒己命令他執行戈林任務業已完成後的現在的兩種新宣傳程序、</p>
<p>戈林到現在已經到等於德國殖民地的義大利去、（按戈林業已返德）監督義大利軍隊的管理事宜、義國軍隊由最小的隊伍到最大的部隊、都將派由德國技術專家和軍官參加、造成操縱形勢、德國國防軍巳經在阿爾卑斯山邊境動員和集中了、</p>
<p>一個時間裏、義大利參謀部長巴里亞尼將軍曾反對而不肯將這一個邊境交出給德國的軍隊、但結果、還是戈林得手了、</p>
<p>據估計、德國在這個邊境集中的軍隊、現約有十萬人、</p>
<p>同時、戈林在視察了義國的各飛機場後、現正自調派更多的德國空軍隊伍到義大利來、他認爲、義大利海岸各城市和羅馬的空防不充分、應該用德國的空軍來補救、</p>
<p>他說、義國的軍用品和重砲隊也應該由德國的技術專家來增强、</p>
<p>最後、他由加拉勃里亞到的黎波里去視察利比亞的義大利軍隊、檢査他們是否有可能予法屬領土以迅速的襲擊、義駐利比里耙督巴爾波將軍說、要這樣說、他們非再有三十萬人不可、</p>
<p>戈林又己經準備就緒調派德軍六萬到土耳其海岸外杜德卡尼斯羣島中的羅德島去、這些軍隊都是作爲征伐軍而有充分軍備和裝配的、他們要向什麽地方挺進呢？對付敍利亞、挨及、或對付巴力斯坦嗎？現在還沒有一個人知道、但希臘對于他們的調動、却已經引起了巨大的焦切、</p>
<p>戈林對於這些德國殖民地軍隊的調赴利比亞、和柏林方面有積極合作、上一星期、已經有德國軍二萬八千人、經過義大利轉往利比亞。</p>
<p>同時、德國的殖民部、遵奉戈林的指示、已下命令徵召殖民地的醫生和官員、叫他們簽訂契的、規定在今年六月尾、他們便可以和他們的家庭一起被調出國、而在七月中旬就任新職、</p>
<p>根據殖民部的秘密命令、德國到那個時候、已經收囘她的某些舊殖民地了、</p>
<p>戈林在義時、日夜和希特勒都有頻密的長途電話往還、作爲對付英波協定之一種反擊、他和希特勒商定了一個進攻波蘭的新計劃、凖備德軍在兩個據點開入波蘭、即波蘭走廊和西利西亞、德國方面以爲：波蘭將不致立起抵抗、或者、無論如何、倘德國答充法國不攻侵法國領土、法國方面將不會出來干涉、</p>
<p>這便是戈林希特勒提出的計劃、換句話說、戈林現正組織德義日西四國、向民主國兇猛的進攻、</p>
<p>弗朗哥將軍、卽義德在西班牙的軍隊、將進攻直布羅陀的英國軍隊、</p>
<p>義大利軍隊則在利比亞和杜尼斯展開其攻勢、合以空軍轟炸地中海上的英法海陸軍力、</p>
<p>德軍將經荷蘭而作大刀國斧的進攻、同時、開入波蘭走廊和西里西亞、</p>
<p>希特勒和戈林决定、如果他們展開兇猛和迅速的軍事進攻、民主國家將　願讓步答應軸心國家的要求、而不敢暴發一切可怕的戰爭、</p>
<p>戈林是義大利國中最受憎恨的一個人、因爲他的軍宮操縱了義大利、他們佩帶兩種　章、一種是卍字的納粹曹章、而另一種則上面寫着『義軍』兩字、這些軍官以傲慢的態度、虐待義大利的老百姓們、</p>
<p>義國人民的忿怒是明顯的、著名的未來派學者瑪里狄尼說：『我贊成羅馬柏林軸心、我相信柏林羅馬軸心、但對於戈林將軍所想像的那種柏林軸心、你就是要了我們的命我都不贊成和不相信哩！』</p>
<p>戈培爾在巴爾幹和利文特（地中海東岸的總稱、由希臘的西部釗埃及的西部）各國的使命是事態的另一面、希特勒命令他準備兩種宣傳計劃、一個是在大戰中用的、另一個則是在民主國屈服時用的、</p>
<p>戈培爾偕同不少他宣傳部中的人員一起出國、並在雅典、巴爾幹和勒文特其他各國徵募新人、</p>
<p>半個月前、希特勒主持宣傳部的一個會議時、粗野的吿訴戈培爾說：『目前的宣傳方法、對德國的目的、一點兒都沒有用處、戈林巳經有了他的軍隊的命令了、現在剩下你爲行將來臨的光榮的日子的新宣傳計劃了』、</p>

<p>【海通社重慶十七日電】據中國軍部發言人稱、因鄂省中部發生劇戰、日軍須從各方趕軍增援、故其他各方面戰事均停頓、隨縣附近、戰事較烈、極難獲眞確消息、但日方之宣傳、有華軍二十師被困、全屬無稽、該發言人又謂、日軍之目的、志在襄陽、幷企圖截斷該區華軍退路、但至今仍未得逞、最近有騎兵千名、從鍾祥出發、向北推進、但被驅囘漢水東岸、日軍本有四師　之衆、今已分調一半往鄂北、因該戰區大部為崇山峻嶺、日軍之機據化部隊、運輸困難、故傷亡慘重、去週日軍死傷人數、約有六千之衆、新野唐河附近、戰情更劇、雙方傷亡均重、唐河曾一度失陷、但旋卽為華軍克復、日眾自失唐河後、卽增援三千、華軍亦由南陽調軍援助、現兩軍在唐河東南相持、現在各地、祇有隨縣前綫、發生大戰、而每次肉搏、日軍傷亡較重、華軍損失不多、雖在日機狂炸後調查、最後該發言人謂、須過三月後始能决定誰勝誰負、現在軍華準備反攻、倘未能成功、卽退守襄陽、但無論如何、日軍無力作包圍華軍而殲滅之企圖云、</p>

<p>合應當之需要。我們應當對於必需的趕緊去製造、當前需要最逼切的英過於軍械及軍事上一切用品、我們各個廠家都要盡量為生產國防出品下提高質量努力、其次、我們要就原料交通種種便利情形、使某一區域發展某一種主產、同時能够分工合作、一面使力量集中、一面奠立國民經濟均衡發展的基礎、最後和國防及一般生產關係密切的是交通工業、現在政府在全力注意、但也希望全國企業家盡量贊助、</p>
<p>第三、要發展固有生產、保持全國的經濟自給、我們現代生產不但要將晨業手工業同時振興、我國一面要建設現代的經濟武器、遇現代武器不够之時、再原始的武困也要使用、今天是我們振興土產的一大機會、這不僅在後方維持民生日用異常煎大、在淪陷區尤有極大意義、×人正在淪陷孫搜刮資金、傾銷×貨、我們在淪陷區坡除了要盡量保護我們的資源以外、必須盡量維持我們的經濟自給、維持我們固有的生產事業、這就是說、要隨時隨地　固我們的經濟　　、圾在中國工業合作協會已經開始進行、這個工作實是很好的事、我們還要加緊在這方面努力、有堅强的經濟堡壘、更要有堅强的精神堡壘、才能够人人抗戰、步步設防、達到全面抗戰的目的、</p>

<p>第五、要屢行節約、　積建國資財、今天在萬分艱苦中、欲求建設、實非厲行節約不可、特別是有關國防資源、例如五金、動力、液　燃料、我們都要愛惜、一滴油是我們的血液、二寸鐵是我們的生命、一分　的電流是我們的呼吸、能够節省一分、就要節省一分、由此推而廣之、無論人力物力時間、都不容許有絲毫浪費、還有可供輸出、　取外匯的物品和原料、都要自已節省下來、換取我們缺乏的物資、此外一切的事業、不可有不必要的重複及作不必要的競爭、而是要集中人力物力、分工合作、向富强的大目標　進、　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c14">生產會議宣言 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>【中央社重慶十七日電】全國生產會議，發表宣言，全文如下。</p>
<p>抗戰建國，兼籌並進，為中央旣定之國策。現代國家，以經濟敎育武力三者為基礎。戰爭之勝負，决於經濟力量之持久供給，又為總裁昭示之明訓。軍興以來，我國之軍事實力，愈戰愈强；今日之要政，端在發展全國生產，使國家經濟實力，日益充實，能與此强大之民族武力相配合，以爭取抗戰之勝利，與樹立建國之基礎。政府懊於斯義，為檢討過去工作，策進將來生產，而有全國生產會議之召集。同人等險阻跋涉，千里赴會。仰體政府謀國之藎籌，深維國家建設之至計，經七日之詳細商討，關於各種生產問題，皆有所决議。謹貢蒭蕘，以供政府施政之參攷，與全國同胞之研討焉。</p>
<p>今後政策</p>
<p>中國經濟建設惟進，經數十年之努力，而大效未響，其主要原因有二：第一，在國民政府成立以前，雖略有建設而無計劃。第二，在國民政府成立以後，雖有計劃而掌於內憂外患，亦未能有長足進展。抗戰旣興，全國統一，內憂旣已消釋，外患亦陷泥沼。今後中國經濟政策，自應絕對以民生主義為依歸，以解决國民生活之正常需要為鵠的，尤須發展國家資本，扶助私人企業，提倡合作運動，同時防止資本集中，使生產事業國家化，民生化，合理化，以奠定新中國之建設基礎，與培植全民族之經濟實力。抗戰建國，為民族安危興亡之所關，政府應本軍事第一，勝利第一，國家至上，民族至上原則，將全國生產力量，統盤籌劃，務使各種軍民必需物品，大量生產，源源不絕，以適應國防之需要而增強抗戰之實力。關於產品之種類與質量，尤應有整個的籌算，各種生產事業間，更須有緊密的連繫，使整個國家經濟生產，成為有糸統有組織之機動整體。民族復興之根據，旣在西南西北之腹地，於是後方經濟建設，乃為刻不容緩之要圖；戰前國家之經濟重心在東部，在戰後若干年之內，國家之經濟重心，將在西郊，故今日後方之經濟建設，皆須出以有計劃之籌算。本會同人，認為今後國家整個生產政策，應以西南西北經濟建設為中心原則之一，自當為全國上下所共認也。</p>

<p>為生產事業之主體，範　廣博，有待擘劃。請先言農林：軍興以來，戰區殘破，沿　沿海，悉遭蹂　，今後之農業建設，旣須積極發展後方農產，以收桑楡之功，而彌補戰區之損失，更須力謀戰區農業之復興，以增强戰　同胞之抗戰力量。吾人認為，吾國農業生產之標的：對內應實現有計劃有組織之生產，使農業能與工業相配合，以協詞各生產部門之關係，對外應增加農產品出口，以提高國際經濟地位。而此種農業政策之籌劃與推行，實非有多數專門人才之羣策羣力不為功。故中央亟應成立一農業設計委員會，而予農業專門人才以隨時貢献意見之便利，同時更應加强　行農業行政機構，使與農業改進有關之各部門，隸屬於統一行政系統之下，保持密切之聯繫，以輔助政策之推行。移民墾殖，為增加生產及救濟難民之之重要設施，現已由中央政府地方政府公私團體，次第　行，但因缺乏統一之管理，組織，與指導，故成效尙未大見，政府亦應設置墾務管理機關，以專責成，並劃分墾區範圍，寬籌墾務經費，培植墾務人才，成立國營省營墾區，以期達到墾殖事業之成功，邊省地曠人稀，移民墾殖，尤為邊政之要務，植基樹本，蓋應先事而預謀也。</p>
<p>農產物價</p>
<p>之高低，直接影響農民之利益，間接影響農業之生產；故提高價格，為增加生產最有效之辦法。今後應由農本局及貿易委員台斟酌情形，以較高價格大量牧買稻，麥，桐油，絲，茶，猪，皮毛等物，並改良農產運銷，以改善農民經濟。而增進其生產力量。我國農民多因缺乏資金，致不克充分施用肥料及勞力，以增加生產。為繁榮農業計，應由農業金融機關從速舉辦長期中期短期之貨欵。農業生產技術之改進，為增加產業之主要方法，我國農業之落後，技術之不科學，推廣之不普遍，為重要原因，除興修農田水利，應由政府統籌辦理外，各農業機關對於作物之育種栽培，蠶縣及畜種之改良，病虫　及獸疫之防治，有效　料之便用，改良農具之自給，義林畜產品之製造，立體農業之推行，戰區農民資源之保蓄，農業推廣以農業合作之積極實施，以及農業　廣機構之健全，均屬必要。至與民生有關之稻，麥，棉及與出口貿易有關之絲，茶，桐油，猪　等，尤應特別注意，以達到改善農民生活，增加農產品之目的也。</p>
<p>森林生產</p>
<p>關係工業原料及農田水利至巨，當此抗戰時期，需用木材，尤為迫切，木材化學工業，亟應由政府舉辦，吾國西南各省不乏大面積之天然林，其已調查而確有價値林木，不下數萬株，凡有關水利及國士保安之之森林，　由政府依法編為國有林區，設局管理，輪流採伐，不特可以供給木材，且可消納人工，倘能由主管機關，指揮監督，使伐木與造林幷進，以免濫伐或　廢之弊，村木不可勝用矣。至若各省現有之荒山荒地，有適於栽培特殊經濟林者，應由中央統籌，督促地方政府實施造林，以期於最短期間，收普及造林之宏效也。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 秣煥平</p>
<p>—重慶五四被炸情形—</p>
<p>【民革社重慶通訊】重慶的市民，不，全國的同胞，將永不會忘記這一天——舊恨新仇的五月四日！</p>
<p>這一天，是晴朗的初夏的天氣，重重瀰漫在渝市天空的　霧，一時都不知躱向何方去了。上午十時半，就發過一次警報。前一天，五月三日——又是舊恨新仇的一日　——的血的敎訓，被炸延燒二里的血的敎訓，使得每一個市民都扶老携幼，沒命地奔逃向防空洞或安存地帶。可是，×機被我截着，竄不進市空。一小時後，警　解除了，市民安定下了跳動的心，回家幹他們的生活去了。</p>
<p>安寧的半天、緊張的半天。——這是五月革命宣傳週的第四天，晚上佈置着火炬巡行呀。</p>
<p>下午四時五十分，太陽快將斜偎着山峯，市民們認為是安全時候了，却突然發生了第一次的空襲警報。生的意志緊抓譽市民的靈魂，他們又一次拚命地向防空洞和安全地帶奔逃，幾歲的孩童，被壓在擁擠的羣衆的脚下；八十老婦，被擠倒在流水般的人羣的道傍。進了防空洞，七十老翁上氣不接下氣，呼吸急速魔　着他臥倒在潮濕的地下，像死了一樣；摩登小姐，拉起衫紐全被擠斷的旗袍，揩額角上像泉水般噴湧而出的大汗。</p>
<p>飛機呼呼地在天空盤旋　。</p>
<p>『一架——兩架——六架——九架——十四架……你看，在那塊……』</p>
<p>『還沒有拉緊急警報，這是我們的飛機呀！』</p>
<p>『誰的飛機又怎麽樣？在防空洞裏嘩啦嘩啦吵的不是漢奸是什慶？』</p>
<p>『別吵！別吵！』第三者揷進一句</p>
<p>飛機在天空盤旋了好一會兒，聲音漸漸的微弱下去，終至聽不到了，躱在防空洞裏的人們舒了一口氣，走出洞門口來，揚手向天空瞭望。</p>
<p>『××的飛機給我們趕走了。』</p>
<p>『回去了　。』</p>
<p>『警報還沒有解除呢！』</p>
<p>『緊急警報還沒有拉，等它解除幹嗎呢？』</p>
<p>於是市民們漸漸地踏上了囘家的道路。</p>
<p>嗚——嗚——鳴——……忽然拉起了緊急警報。市民們立卽奔回防空洞裏</p>
<p>『天誅地滅的！怎麽××飛機又轉囘來了？』</p>
<p>每個臉孔上的肌肉跳迸出憤懷的火把。</p>
<p>矗！轟轟！轟轟轟！……炸彈聯珠般被掉下來，重慶市畔的長江的水，　震動得蕩漾着；重慶市上的山峯被震動得像地震一樣；防空洞裏的人們全把變手蒙住了耳朵，臉孔震驚得變成了泥土色；死的恐怖籠軍着防空洞，大家都摒窒着呼吸，心頭一股憤恨刺激起全身的細胞，赤血迸出出醫：</p>
<p>『他媽的！就是死，也得上前綫拚他幾個××才死呢』</p>
<p>哄降——哄隆——哄隆——的笨重的機聲，又漸漸地微弱了，終至于聽不見了。市民們還戰顫在防空洞裏，未敢稍動。躁念，苦悶，其緊張的情緒羅露在他們（她們）的眼光與肌肉上。過丁好一會兒，他們爬出來，</p>
<p>『唉啊！——』</p>
<p>愕然地驚　了一聲。</p>
<p>重慶市燃着了滿天的烽火！</p>
<p>据說，從前×機投彈，是一個一個的投下來的，現在可不同了，是幾十個同時掉下來的，計這天闖入市空轟炸的×機有二十七架，每一架都投下十個八個，或幾十個炸彈，而且多半是燃燒彈。重慶的房子都是木造的，又很密，街巷又窄，在拂拂的初夏的風搧吹下，能不一下就滿天烟火熊熊呢？</p>
<p>商業繁盛區，文化中心區，外國領使館所在地的興隆街，都郵街，蒼坪街，關廟　，柴家巷；　事巷，倉仙橋，七星　等　，都在火焰中呻吟着；幾家大百貨公司的「百貨」都被火呑噬了，「一二八」被慘燒後，仍未恢復元氣的商務印書館也被毀滅了；英法的使領館固受損失，卽如×人的盟邦——德國的領事館也變成了火的餘燼……</p>
<p>熊熊的火舌又寬又長，伸出了雲霄使光明的月亮也失了顏色；千千萬萬的市民——男女老幼的，在火舌裏呻吟，號哭，掙扎……！</p>
<p>僥倖逃脫在火舌外的市民，在警報解除後，發覺自己的房屋店家所在地被燒了，立刻臉上膨起悲憤的皺紋，奔向火口裏去，我尋自己的父親，妻子，兒女，朋友，全市的消防隊，防護團，救護隊，乃至軍警，三民主義的靑年團等，都全體動員，搶救火警，難民，拆火巷……無數市民，男女老幼，　袴的，長衫的，摩登的，西服的，坐在街頭，揑緊拳頭，望着漸潮拓展開去的火舌。這樣，過了五月四日的一宵！</p>
<p>五月五日的淸晨，蔣委員長立刻命令撥一百萬巨欵急賑受難同胞。并着各機關分數處開始登記難民；同時集中上至林主席，蔣委員長，下至一般公務員及私人的大小汽車，江河的船隻等，由政府統制，歸何應欽，兪飛鵬二部長指擇，實行緊急免費輪送難民至各安全　份。</p>
<p>對于災區，則動員市防護、救護、軍警人等，全體出動，實行緊實挖掘屍體工作。被挖出來的死屍，衣服被燒光了，像出爐的火猪，有些面目黧黑，不能辨認；有些骨肉糢糊，不成人樣；有些則有頭無足，有些則肢體分離；一個個從火堆裏拖出街頭，一個個被裝進四塊錢一個的薄木板棺材裏，又一個個被抬到市郊掩埋的地方去，誰看了不掉下哀悼的眼淚？誰看了不激起憤怒的火潮！</p>
<p>挖掘的工作，還在工作着；掩埋的工作，也還在艦續着；据七日晨的統計，公家所買的四塊錢一個棺材費，已達三萬六千塊錢；私家出錢買棺材，及不用棺材掩埋的還不算在內：有幾條街又還沒有挖掘，我們試想想，×寇這次在重慶的放火，究竟死了多少良善的平民？至于財產的損失，那更無法統計！</p>
<p>我們的背上又背上了一筆的血債，這是舊恨中加上了新仇的血債，每一個重慶市的市民，每一個中國的同胞，都絕對不會忘記它，都將會用血去報復它！（五月七日于重慶）</p>

<p>蔣委員長為防制×機轟炸，於十六日發表吿各省市政府與全國同胞書，全文業載昨日本報。蔣委員長指出×閥空襲計劃，（一）為欲以不斷的轟炸，威脅我全民抗戰精神，冀我向×投降；（二）為欲以猛烈的轟炸，斷絕吾同胞之生活，脅我同胞於流離失所中减少生產而影響抗戰前途；（三）為欲以集中的轟炸，妨害我社會之安寧而擾亂我後方的秩序。因此蔣委員長鄭重地以三點勉我全國同胞，卽第一要念念不忘此深恨大仇，更堅抗戰到底的决心，粉碎×閥毒計，從死中求生。第二要積極疏散城市居民，並且認眞加强組織，下鄉去發展農村，鞏固持久抗戰的戰線，奠定未來建國的基礎。第三是要上下合作，加緊防護工作，務期於×機來襲之際，不致遭受重大損害，並勿使社會秩序，略受不良影響。蔣委員長在這篇訓詞中還特別指出目前局勢中我國之空前勝利及××之來路瘋狂，而望我全國軍民今後倍增團結，誓死　恥，親愛精誠，共報國仇。</p>
<p>但看×機瘋狂轟炸重慶等各地以來，我重臘民衆之極無怨言，我全國民衆對×××愾之益形增高，我內外輿論之一致痛斥×××××行與呼籲全國倍加團結擁護中央堅持抗戰，我們可以歡呼指出：我們全體不願做奴隸的中華兒女，是已經用精誠擁護的事實來表現其遵從將委員長的訓詞了！不過，誠如蔣委員長所說：『×欲滅吾民族，必先斷吾民命，而其未來殲酷之獸行，必比今日為尤甚。』所以我們全國同胞，尤必須人人細讀蔣委員長此次訓詞全文，誠心誠意，切實遵行。特別是我們苟免×人之轟炸屠殺而倫生於國外的各界僑胞，尤應三復蔣委員長此次訓詞，念念不忘×寇對我祖國河山故鄉同胞××××××××××。蔣委員長說：『我同胞之攖其彈者或血肉糜爛，或家室為墟，苟有人心，能無憫惻？復念吾同胞之在淪陷區者，男為×人驅使束轉，女受×軍逼害污辱，仰伺×顏，俯私飲泣，求生不獲，拚死不能！』凡我僑胞，設有人心，思念及此，能不心痛？但是又誠如蔣委員長所昭示：『×機此次到處狂炸之行為，固殘忍可恨，而其奇窘可知』，所以我們僑胞，在此時機，不能祗是回首祖國而心痛如焚，更應倍加緊張起來，嚴肅起來，團結起來，一面向蔣委員長表示崇高的敬體與擁潛之誠，向空襲下之同胞及淪陷區同胞表示最大的同情與救助之誠，一面更應從事實上擁護全國團結，擁護持久抗戰，推行精　動員，舉行國民公約宣誓，動員僑胞回國服務，××××援助前綫，擴大統一的救濟難民援助將士的募捐運動，特別是發動大規模的國際宣傳，和盡一切力量以增加祖國空防力量。</p>

<p>「打蔴雀」在香港是　認為「高尙」的消遣，戶內遊戲之一，所以家家戶戶，甚至小商人們在街邊也開起檯來，打其四國，雀聲拍拍，是「打」之無禁的。</p>

<p>中環結志街的「航空」，對海廟南街的「鷄記」，是遠近聞名的　雀館。前者似乎是創立最早，抬位最多，（兩舖打通，擺設三四十張檯位）中環方面的勞苦大衆，於工餘之暇，尤其是出糧之日，誰都到驤若到「航空」去。後者是對海挺大的一家，並且分枝兩處。</p>
<p>開設蔴雀館的地點，大抵以中下層小市民們叢集之區為最多，中區的結志　和　李活道近水坑口的一段，東江　仔春　街，交加街，西區則西　盤和第一　，對　則　南街；吳淞街，炮台街，上海街和廣東道近官通內一段，都可說是藤雀館林立之區。無論日夜；均高朋通　。我們試到裏邊巡　一下，只見有若干人站着等候「候補」，而從沒有見過空　剩餘的。「消遣」的人們之多。　使你為之咋舌。</p>
<p>他們營業的方法是　「抽水」，規定一元一底的，東　每家　水二先，以後每四每家抽水一先，二元三元一底的，照此類推。入座打牌的，均打『　面』，就是你有多少錢須盡量放在檯上，據說至少須有六個銅板，才可落　。輪完了便須「推位　國」，候補的　馬上登位。這　　法，是老板們一來為防止『空槍上陣」，再則可以消滅彼此間的爭執。</p>
<p>因為這些蔴雀館是諸式人等均可入場的，所以品流複發，良莠不齊。月前因為九龍方面搶刦案頻頻發生，警察當局為積極防範　清匪徒起見，有一個時期，曾在這些蔴雀館　拘捕可疑的匪徒不少。此外，靠賭吃飯的老千們混跡其間，打架爭執，自然難免，　是老板們為要遏止和防　這類事情的發生，便都僱有一兩個勇夫在舘　「　頭」（監視之意），如果老千們再不識趣，經勇夫們警吿　　仍來光顧的，那末，自然是飽以老拳，驅諸門外。</p>
<p>像「航空」和『鷄記』等這些大規模一點的麻雀館，估計他們每天的收入，除了皮費，凈利六七十元，少一點的也有一二十元。</p>
<p>『派使用』，據說蔴雀館和其他的『烟窟』『丸格』是一樣不能例外的。</p>

<p>中央電影場預定的第一部出品是「孤城喋血」抗戰新聞片、該片自從去年開始攝製以來、因材料問題、工作時吿停頓、及至最近、始行全部扮製完竣、該片故事是叙述姚子靑將軍死守寶山城的那段壯烈的史蹟、演員方面如柏森、白雲、包時等都是受過大學都育的、雖則他們不是倚老賣老的大明星、在銀幕上演劇的經　也許不很熟練、但是他們的熟忱與努力却是使該片例外生色不少的、</p>
<p>跟着『孤城喋血』同時攝竣的、還有一部『勝利的前奏』該片是抗戰新聞實錄片、所以、它是歸納于『對日抗戰新聞實錄片』第五卷、在這部片中、有『新生活運動五週紀念』的大會實情、蔣委員長向婦女同胞的訓詞、宋美齡女士為婦女獻金而發表意見、以及我西北騎兵襲擊的雄姿和日人狼狽逃竄的一幕實錄、全片都是便人看了感到異常興奮的鏡頭</p>

<p>第一個依照新勞動法拍戲的、是一位生下來僅十六天的小寶貝、在電話中實片『亞歷山大加拉罕倍爾傳』（洛麗泰楊及唐亞曼契合演）中演出、劇情中有一節是洛麗泰楊應抱着一個初生的嬰兒、未開拍之先、用一只洋娃娃來試演、試演到純然的時候、才開拍、一切準備好、乳母便把嬰兒抱來、他的母親和本州衛生署的代表跟隨着、在以白緞為牆的化裝室裏、醫生滴一小滴消毒油在小寶貝的眼睛裏、以避免弧燈的强光及殺菌、於是開拍了、洛麗泰楊輕輕地抱了小寶貝、唐亞曼契彎身下去看他、再轉過身來、鏡頭便完了、所費的時間僅僅十秒鐘、謹愼的導演見尙有餘二十秒鐘、命令重拍、但一到第三十秒鐘的時候、官署代表一直站在旁邊看着表的、這時便跑過來說、『到了、』於是小寶貝便算完成了他一天的工作了</p>

<p>現在香港的童星葛佐治、他依舊像在「迷途的羔羊」一片中的活潑可愛、不邊、他雖然還是一個小孩子、可是他對於成人的一切都了解得透切了、見到他的人、因而常常感到他現在已有着成人的習氣了、你們也許要懷疑他在上海時的天眞姿態、怎麽會消失得這樣的快速呢、是不是香港的環境造成了他、還是他自已的心理變態呢、</p>
<p>他近日很少演戲、終日還是閒着、聽說他最遲在六月以前、他將要到菲律賓去、因為他有一位伯伯、在那邊海關辦事、還有幾個哥哥也同在一處做事、內中有一個哥哥是無線電公司的高級職員、他到那邊去的目的就是想學習無線電、</p>
<p>葛佐治的家庭經濟環境並不大好、而目前的生活狀况並不見佳、現在人家又不請他演戲、本來、童星在香港一向是不為人所注重、所以。他必要說離影界到另一社會去找出路了、</p>

<p>畢克林微笑了、像是他和希金的打賭經巳得到勝利、『我再說一遍——如果你能使她變成一個女公爵、你的確是世上最偉大的敎師了』、</p>
<p>一個一個的星期過去着、一邊是忍耐地敎、一邊是忍耐地學習、愛莉莎反復　念着完全沒有意義的宇音、</p>
<p>『不、愛莉莎、不對、再念過、『希金有時會憂慮地脫下眼鏡、揮動着糾芷她的發昔、『我們再來、啊——啊！—像Fathei一字中的A字聲音一樣』</p>
<p>愛莉莎學習得非常專心、一點不畏艱難、這一點倒也使希金很感動、</p>
<p>他的敎授方法是很簡單、他只敎她裝作一切都不知道、完全像從開始學語一樣、他還敎她怎樣進房間、怎樣出房間、怎樣立、怎樣坐、怎樣定路、最後他總又回到她的發昔問題上來、叫她跟着他的說話香調、一遍又一遍的復述出來、直到說得淸楚為止、</p>
<p>數月之後、希金對畢克林將軍說、『成功的日子到了、可以帶她出去試試』、他想了一會、笑說道、「有了、去見我母親」、</p>
<p>亨利希金敎授踏上社會是怎樣受人尊敬的人啊、可是他的母親見了他總還當他一個孩子看待、他今天走進她的會客室時、母親還說、『我今天有許多賓客呢、你不應該來、你是不懂禮儀的』</p>
<p>母子談着、他略略說了一些關於愛莉莎的事、他最後說、「我今天叫她到這裏來、你不用担心、她不會出醜的、只不過談些氣候和健康等一類的客套話而已」、</p>
<p>這時賓客巳絡繹到來、希金很有些担心、他的心房也跳躍得快起來、因為所到的都是些貴族階級人物、畢克林將軍後來也到、不多一會、女僕終於報吿杜麗特兒小姐來了、</p>
<p>愛莉莎在門口出現了、她穿着美麗服裝、唇上露着微笑、她向室內看了看、便走向密昔司希金面前、用可愛的淸析而又熱忱的語音說：「密昔司希金、願你安好、希令敎授說我可以來的」、</p>
<p>「不錯、眞是這樣」、他的母親懇親地說、『非常歡迎你到來』、好像她和愛莉莎是很知己的老朋友、把她一一同別的客人介紹了、當走到立在壁爐邊的希金面前、她對愛莉莎說、「我的兒子你是巳經認識了的——」</p>

<h3 id="c68">完成包辦錦標的創作　南華再獲旭和杯　海軍雖頑抗卒以一比四敗陣 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】春去也、好景不常、那「恢復繁榮」的足球季　刻下　着九十春光而消逝、風流雲散、最是銷</p>
<p>昨天下午、旭和杯的爭標戰、在加山會演、這是六大錦標　的尾聲、事關重要、不比　閒、因為這一妾身未分明的愛物、在「三角」追求中、到底是誰勝利、乃决之此　、</p>
<p>畢竟南華有福、結下「良緣」、把「情敵」洋水兵、迎　痛擊、敎他們返囘艦上、駛出「愛河」、</p>
<p>南華此　、一舉兩得、蓋不獨重登「王座」而已、復完成　華隊包辦錦標的創作、如此功動、可謂光前裕後、</p>
<p>然而、海軍並非「護花無力」、祇因福簿緣慳、在競爭中、他們都努力奮鬥、異常橫頑、日曾打成一比零佔先的局面、　得一個罰南華十二碼球、及幾次乘空攻門的應勝機會、奈何脚頭沒眼睛、瞎踢不命中、座上「約翰」之流、見狀均為氣短、</p>
<p>雙方上陣人馬、均與上次略有不同、南華方面、臨時邀得萬迷共仰的李惠堂出任中鋒、於　增强前綫的攻力、原本預佈的「軍帖」中、沒有中堂的名字、但葉北華及陳德輝均足痛、致前綫有才　之嘆、「軍師一莫慶因此着急起來、到了昨天上午、才徵得惠堂的同意、願為善舉而登塲、其實、惠堂對我華隊否包辦錦標的事、和我們同一機關心、何况獲得的國際杯及麗華杯、他又是個出力份子、這囘爭奪旭和杯、他雖欲置身事外、惟適因傷者不能參戰、復以莫軍師殷殷相邀、他遂不得不出任觀巨、以求完全最後一舉、毋使功虧　簣、而其對母會之忠誠、的是難得、假如昨天地不列與戎行的話、則能否制勝、頗成疑問、為的是洋水兵於此役表演很好、旣有惠堂在陣、猶未易進攻取勝、如其缺席、便難保不為洋水兵所畋、故昨戰成功、無疑地是惠堂、有「錦標　」得人則興、亦南華之福、</p>
<p>海軍方面、前綫更換兩新人、其餘與上次一樣、惟雖有更換、戰鬥力並未削滅、反見增强、守衛尤為得體、中堅谷巴、釘住惠　、形影不離、使惠堂不易找得機會、故當軒地未被判難場之前、尙與南華戰成工力悉敵的局面、情勢亦至緊張、扣人心弦、不該的軒地不够涵養、動手毆打楊水益、觸犯「天條」、犧牲自己、復因此使已隊以寡敵衆、卽陷於崩潰狀態中、沒可救藥、再負兩球、致成南華大勝的地位、然我們固求南華必勝、用不着以「餓狸悲鼠」的態度、對海軍假意憐惜、不過、當時極多精彩而又緊張的戰局、竟給軒地不自愼重的原因、把整個弄糟、眞是美中不足、故我認為軒地是海軍方面的罪人、又是看客方面的掃興者、</p>
<p>南華各將、善于濕地作戰、球場經過細雨之後、塲地柔軟如綿、南華旣得天時、復得地利、目賽時紅日當空、擇得背日為陣、故政勢遂銳不可當、操勝是應該的、</p>
<p>銀笛鳴後、　利士先利戰鼓、向前直國、希望一鼓作氣、直搗黃龍、慶才從旁出擊、海軍攻　稍殺、由是短兵相接、廣森邊關誓師、直攻海軍腹地、但未奏功、</p>
<p>巳而活頓傳中被阻、南華帶球反攻、廣森立卽傳中落點甚佳、「佛爺」立用佛頭一頂、枉費心機、</p>
<p>鏖戰多時、海軍中路進兵、天生抵擋不來、為　敲士直入內地、舉足射門、應聲而入、先開紀錄、</p>
<p>中綫再開、南華反攻、惠堂得水益傳中、轉與「佛爺」斜射不中、惠堂不甘損失、伺機而起、未幾、惠堂中路傳球、交與景祥、果如人願、一舉命中、　成和局不料眨眼間、海軍中鋒來犯、天生出擊、竟被球證指為犯規、被罰十二碼球、此時　迷莫不心驚胆跳、谷巴上前主踢、榮才懷中抱月、出球于險、球迷掌聲雷、</p>
<p>混戰良久、廣森活動、及時傳中、思堂得球射立、直入網中、梅開二度、勝局由此開始了、上半時南華以二比一先勝、</p>
<p>球人喘氣未過、再上征途、惠堂率領三軍、向前推動、被阻不前、移時、廣森向前輸糧、惠堂射高而退、海軍邊境進兵、連破重國、菴士杜郎傳中美妙、差幸拖般射球不中、</p>
<p>未幾、摩利士單刀赴會、危機迫切、倘非國威奇兵突出、難免一失、</p>
<p>海軍屢在甫華陣內尋　抵隊、希望雪恥、已而菴士杜郞陣前發彈、勁而且疾、幸榮才手急眼快、將球接着、方始度過危關、</p>
<p>南華伺機進襲二當短兵混戰時、軒地不合毆打水益、為球證所見、罰其退場、南華幷得十二碼球之利、惠堂主射中的、成三比一之局、再戰約一分鐘、佛爺亦射球立功、大勢遂定、結果四對一南華得勝、於是此一幕七十分鐘之旭和杯爭奪戰、乃吿閉幕、</p>
<p>賽畢、由駐華陸軍總司令賈乃錫夫人頒獎、此時球迷圍　而觀、當惠堂接受大銀　時、迷民咸報以熱烈的掌聲、戰時兩陣如下、</p>

<p>……昨天下午、雨過天靑、陽光大露、原定之菲港網球表演賽、得以依時舉行、一般迷哥、額手稱慶、</p>
<p>……菲律濱第一台杯選手山渣士、別來無恙、丰彩依然、昨與菲島後起之秀菴邦、道經此境、聯袂蒞場、菴邦年僅十七歲、身高不過五尺、為歷　出席台杯賽最幼之選手、他的皮膚作深棕色、俱有菲律濱的家鄉風味、身輕如燕、舉動活潑、而又敏捷、的是良村、</p>
<p>……徐氏兄弟先與菲選手作雙打賽、大徐先發球、與弟弟合拍得宜、先獲一光局、次局由山渣士發球、為勢兇悍、落點又有好角度、先後得「愛司」球四枚、一比一做成和局、此後山渣士每每利用發球得分、却使兩徐一籌莫展、乃以五比三佔優勢、此時菴邦以勝利在握、連演絕技、攔網一道、快捷而穩健、撇出之球、多在網邊而去、弄到徐氏兄弟、束手無策、以六比三先勝</p>
<p>……次盤徐氏兄弟已悉菲選手對于高壓一道、無甚把握、有機卽送出高球、乘弱而取、乃以二比零得利、旋又以三比一佔先、直至山渣士發球時始失手、再被追至二比三、繼而三比三打成平手、至此、徐氏兄弟、恐再損失、便前功盡棄、乃振臂而起、全神注意、發揮絕技、卒抵達五比三之優勢、而菴邦亦施展好工夫、協助山渣士長扣短襲、迭有所獲、不過兩徐亦還以顏色、故將勝而不能勝者凡八次、競爭之劇、由此可見、結果、兩徐搶得决勝點、以六比四得回一盤、握手言和、</p>
<p>……以昨日之表演而論、菴邦較山渣士為出色、雖則他的發球術較差、但抽殺及　網、皆有兇險之角度、無怪其能壓倒有經驗之菲將嘉維亞、</p>
<p>……山法士最搜發球、與徐氏兄弟　戰兩盤中、共得十次「愛司」球、惟最大的弱點、是高壓失手頻頻、假如遇着採韌性戰略之何家流及李汝榮一組、必受威　、</p>
<p>……第二戰、是由菲選手對德孚及高路文、德孚打來甚勁、發球亦佳、可惜高路文無濟于事、不能抵擋菲隊之攻襲、乃以一比二見負、</p>
<p>第一幕</p>
<p>山菴　六比三　四比六　兩徐</p>
<p>第二幕</p>
<p>山菴　六比三　四比六　七比五　德高</p>
<p>……因德孚及高路文一組與菲選手連賽三盤德高需時頗久、故影響原定秩序、小徐對菴邦之單打、迫得取消、改於今日一較高下、探悉今日秩序如下、</p>

<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>對於體格訓練應有的革新</p>
<p>據領袖「欲造成抗戰建國的堅鉅　業，必有需於全國靑年的一致團結，共同努力」的昭示，足見靑年在當前所處地位的重要，學生是靑年的靈魂，全國靑年，須在他們領導下邁進。要使靑年都能蔚為國用，有需於學生的淬勵奮發，是明顯的事實而學生要在這九死一生的艱苦環境中負起領導靑年的責任，决非多愁善病，詎靡頽廢者所能勝任愉快，從可知當前學生體格訓練的重要，更是不可移易的鐵則了。</p>
<p>我國事為訓練學生體格而設的體育學校，巳有着攸久的歷史，但至今學生體格堅强的程度，仍是不能如我們的心願，此中原因固有多端，而拾人唾餘，耳食盲從，和一仍不變，墨守陳法，實是主要原因之一。在當前急切需要學生具備堅强的體格來担負挽救危亡的重任之際，非把已往的錯誤者，不合者，澈底革新，不能希望達到目的，筆者本觀察所得，供獻一些意見，希望學生關心體格訓練者，加以注意</p>
<p>一，觀念的革新：觀念猶之行路所取的途徑：正確的觀念，猶之　莊大道，平坦寬廣，前途可無絲毫障碍；錯誤的觀念，猶之荒僻歧徑，荆棘重重，行來必遇意料的困難。學生對於體格訓練，要希望收效，必先從革除錯誤的觀念，具備正確的觀念入手。</p>

<h3 id="c79">關於戰事損失　處理辦法之商榷 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 陸善熾</p>
<p>（四）或有人以為將戰事損失、列為遞延資產後、因可分年攤提、結入損費、使以後各年度之純益减少、故在所得稅負担上、將可較為有利、其實並不盡然、蓋所得稅之計算、須以純益合資本實額之大小、求出比例、以為引用稅事之標準、但稅率有高低、純益亦有多寡、同時各業所受戰事損失之程度、至有不齊、而戰後若干年間之營業成績、各業亦至不一律、若干事業、在某種環境之下、雖可藉戰事損失之作為遞延資產、而在納稅上的成為有利、但亦安知無若干事業、適因將戰事損失作為遞延資產、而反須在納稅上、成為不利、是以就納稅負担上着眼、將戰事損失作為遞延資產後、政府與工商業、雙方皆屬有利有弊、未可斷論、此就納稅負担上、認為有待商榷者四、</p>
<p>（五）凡受有戰事損失一之專業、其原來種有公積及準備者、在第一年固可以之抵冲、作為　補、但其不足之額、一經列為資產、則除於每年决算時、可以攤提一部分外、以後雖能結出領額盈餘、亦將無法從速彌補、同時在以樣結有盈餘之年度、公積是否仍應照提、比項提存之公積、是否仍可陸續以之抵冲戰事損失、亦將成為問題、至於戰事損失作為遞延資產後之攤提標準、照經濟部批示、雖云每年不得多於十分之一、但事實上戰事損失、如須在以後數年內陸續决定者、將不免因遞延資產之原額發生變動、而在計算上、感覺困難、此就會計實務上、認為有待商榷者五、</p>
<p>以上所述、不過就思所及、舉其犖大者、際考實上恐因各業過去財政基礎有强弱、財產機構有不同、所受損失有鉅細、及未來趨勢有善惡而使問題之發生、益陷於複　、由此可知戰事損失、無論在會計理論上、理財政策上、法律觀點上、納稅負擔上、會計實務上、以及戰後興上、似均不宜以之作為遞延資產處理、而分作十年以上、逐漸攤提、依作者意見、此次戰事結果、工商業所受損失、固　重大、但旣受之損失、已屬無可挽囘、而今後之復興、正應急起直追、是以為工商事業計、與使顧戀殘局、勉强苟延、毋忍痛一時、穩健求進、若以為有若干事業、損失過鉅、苟不假予寬貸、恐元氣大傷、難以恢復、因此主張必須講求相當之非常置者、竊以為亦應從穩健而有效之途着想、而不宜出之於隱蔽損失、或虛抬資產、以徒　後惠。以下姑就鄙意為戰事損失之處理問題、作相當建議、但是否可行、未敢自信、還祈會計界及事業界先進、有以敎正之。</p>
<p>一、有財產淪陷戰區、經查明並未燬損、但一時無法處分、並行使所有　者、應另行表示、列為「戰區資產、」其業已查相燬損者、作為戰事損失、</p>
<p>二、戰前所發生之應收帳欵、經證實無法牧取者、列為戰事損失、其能否收取、未可證實、而其原因、由於債務人行踪不明者、經過兩年後、列為戰事損失、非由於債務人行蹤不明、而一時無法收取者、經查明後應另行表示、列為一戰前延收帳欵、」</p>
<p>三、對於財產列入戰事損失之估價、以戰前最後之帳面價格為標準、其為固定資產而有折舊準留者、為存貨而有跌價　備者、及為　牧帳欵而有呆帳準　者、均應分別從原價中減除、其以餘額、列為損失、</p>
<p>四、對於「戰區資產」、仍應逐年開除折舊、對於「戰前延牧帳款」、仍應逐年開除呆帳、</p>
<p>五、對於戰區財產之維持費、應作為各該年度之損失費、對於戰區財產之搬運費、應列為戰事損失、</p>
<p>六、凡有戰區財產未經查明整理之事業、如經决算、結有盈餘、應全部提作戰事損失準備、不得漲分設息、</p>
<p>七、對於戰事損失、經查明確定定後、應儘先以原有公積準備、為之彌補、彌補不足之額、列入當年度損費計算、</p>
<p>八、關於公積準備彌補虧損之順位、應先以盈餘滾存及未分派盈餘、次以不指定用途之任意公積、再次以指定用途而無對外契約關係之任意公積、最後為法定公積、</p>
<p>九、因以戰事損失列為捐費、致當年度發生虧損時、其虧損額、應在以後年度發生純　時、儘先彌補、</p>
<p>十、虧損額已超過資本總額三分之一者、仍應在可能範圍內、召集股東會、决定進行方針、及補救辦法、其因虧損過鉅、致形成財產不足抵償債務時、如其業務仍可進行、且前途應有復興希望者、得准其取得債權人之同意諒解、暫時免予宣吿破產、其業已陷於停頓、且前途顯無復興希望者、仍應宣吿破產、</p>
<p>十一、召集股東會議時對於住址不明無法通知之股東樣數、得暫作　除論、（此為對於股東會無法召集時之一種臨時救濟辦法）、</p>
<p>十二、股軟有未繳足者、應在結有虧損時、一律開始催收、在一年內未能收取者、停止其股東之權利、斯時對於虧損額之計算、以是于超過催繳後實收股欵總額（連以前收取者）三分之一為標準、如需要增减資本、對於欠繳股　郁份、得依欠繳比例、合倂為整股後計算、（本款為對於股東失權之一種臨時）救濟辦法、蓋依公司法規定、股欵經二次催繳後、仍不來數者、公司得宣吿其股東之失權、並拍賣其股份但事實上戰後股東流離遷徙、不免有因不可抗力之事由、而不能如期繳納者、故為實容計主張僅僅　止其股權之行使、惟斯時如需要增資或減負、則對於欠收之股款、自惟有先以合倂股數方法、實行减資）、</p>
<p>十三、對於曾受戰事損失因而結有虧損之事業、在其虧損尙未彌補足額以前、如有盈餘、應魏政府為「體卹商艱」並維護稅本起見、留時免除其繳　所得稅之　務、但虧損一經彌補足織、卽仍應照歡、（依所得稅之規定、上年度之虧損、不得列入下年度計算、但此係就平時而言、若在戰時、工商業之受有損害者、已屬元氣大傷、目　虧損原因、亦非由於經　不良、政府自宜特別予以實貸、俾可期其早日恢復。同時取府對於因戰事而獲得非常利得之事業、旣有過分利得稅之　收、則對於因戰事而成為虧損之事業、自亦應免其納稅、方稱公允、）</p>
<p>十四、為顧全公司及多數股東之資金周轉起見、雖在戰事虧損尙未彌補足額以前如其虧損未達資本總額三分之一、得准其在結有盈餘之年、分派不超過週年五厘之股息、但對於股息所得之利息所得稅、仍應照納、（查公司法上對於需要長期建設之事業、原設有建設利息之辦法、故此處似不妨援用、）</p>
<p>以上辦法、俱係適用於目前戰事期間、而帶有消極性質、至於將來戰事平定之後、為謀整個工商業之復興繁榮起見、自尙應從積極方面、講求救濟辦法、如發行復興公債、舉行工商貸款等、皆有效之救　辦法也、惟以其不涉於本文之範圍、暫置不論、（完）</p>

<h3 id="c80">謬論與事實 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 于天</p>
<p>汪精衛於抗戰以前，會經在紀念週上發表過一篇關於建設方案的演說。其中，他對於中國文定作家的思想。作了了個批評。「我們試一檢查數年以來國內流行的文藝作品，這是於息想有相當影響的。我們覺得這些文藝作品，大半幾乎可以說是全部對於現在的社曾經濟，充滿着消極的破壞的思想，而沒有積極的建設的思想。他們似乎是應用了文藝作家一句話「祇　病症不開藥方』的口號，然而這一句口號，應用得太濫，是會發生危險的。」</p>
<p>這樣範統地對於文藝作品來作評價，這樣隨便地說話，批評；太濫了，倒是會發生危險的。</p>
<p>縱觀我們的文藝作家。誰都爲着保衛祖國而站到各人的崗位上去了：有的，在　地背着槍變爲英勇的戰士，有的，揑着筆寫出了爆炸彈一樣的文字，對漢奸們的謠言，對悲觀消極者的論調，作若無情的鬥爭；有的，在鄕村裏寫着壁報，編出了抗戰的小調，啓發了我們的晨民們底鬥爭情緒——那種情結潛伏在他們的血液裏，從他們的詛宗那幾代早已有了的。這些，爲當時的汪精衍所預料不到，也爲今日的汪精衛所看不到的。</p>
<p>最近：汪猜衛的避匯國外，接連發表了荒謬的「艷電」，「舉一　例」，『　華僑某君書』，「重要聲明」等，難道是積極建設思想的表現吧？</p>
<p>最近：全國文藝界抗戰庭會全體會員的通電討汪，這也是受消極的破壞思想的影響吧？</p>
<p>關於積極的建設，在我們的國家裏，無論那方面，都是多麼需要！×人　天的用飛機，用大砲，來摧毀我們的城市裏的建築物，甚至連僻　的鄉間的小茅舍都給縱火燒去。但是，×人愈是這樣的沒有理性，我們愈是要鬥爭下去，幷且非要給人們看到理性不可。我們的戰士，我們的領袖們是不知道氣餒的。抗戰已經成爲一宗必需勝利的事業，正如我們每天必需有食物一樣，否則，我們使是死亡！客觀上，由於每個人民的奮起，由於整個國家的眞誠的團結，由於國際方面的那麼多那麼誠懇的同情。誠然一如我們所有的堅强的意識：我們會勝利，我們必需勝利，我們要爭取勝利！</p>
<p>抗戰以來，以及戰爭沒有發生以前，我們的文藝作品是一貫地鬥爭的姿態出現的，瞿秋白，魯迅，以及在鬥爭中的那些作家們，他們所給予我們的祇是「祇指病症，不開樂方」的口號麼？</p>
<p>對於當時的社會經濟，如果要求我們的文藝作家，起着積極的建設的思想，汪精衛何不這樣說：『來吧，接受鄰國的恩惠吧，中國的病症是不够屆　呀。』</p>
<p>事　終於證明了一切。</p>
<p>所以，汪精衛的背叛祖國，並不是偶然的。一貫地，他　着一　　誤的思想：一　地，他輕易地胡指亂　。</p>
<p>日。已比塞說：『……在生活中沒有理性的基礎，必然要陷入壓世主義的深　，浸沉在失望裏。』</p>
<p>『舉一個例』中，汪精衛有點悲觀得『可憐』。</p>
<p>我們的文藝作家，縱使不上前線去，那麼揭發一點漢奸們的無　與陰險的　相——並不斷地跟他們的「理論」作堅决的鬥爭，也是一種力量，而且是客觀上的需要。</p>
<p>那些漢奸們的理論，如果形象化了，將更獲得人們的詛咒。</p>
<h3 id="c81">偷入蕪湖城　（續） <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 王坪</p>
<p>×人佔據下城市的剪影</p>
<p>但是，無論如何不行，一路拉，一路駡便向集谷倉走去，一會兒，慘叫的聲音雜薯燒具的肉味　到人們的耳裏鼻裏…心裏…沒有人致多聽一聲這慘絕人　的哀叫！這次一共燒了傷兵一百多，在蕪湖，這樣燒傷兵的哀叫，巳經不知多少囘了，這告訴老百姓，一日本佬對自己尚且如此，對中國人國……。</p>
<p>現在談一談蕪湖敵人在蕪湖的處施：</p>
<p>三月廿八，是維新政府的週年紀念，偽縣府下令大麼祝，開提燈會，遊街，在城廂開演講會，講演的主要內容有三點，</p>
<p>（一）政治方面是「反蔣」「反共」「反英」，「擁汪」。</p>
<p>（二）經濟方面是「復興工業」「振興農村」！</p>
<p>（三）「社會秩序」方面是編制保甲，改良民證爲安居證。</p>
<p>茲錄幾段演講詞在下面，以見一斑：</p>
<p>「……中國的眞正敵人是誰？是×帝國主義，他自雅片戰爭以後，便到處劃租界，割地方……欵負中國政府興中國人，最近又借款給黨政府，這正是經濟侵略的鐵證……你們看他們那藍　　高鼻子，黃頭髪，才是眞的洋鬼子，才是我們的敵人！「日本是軍」和中國是同文同種，樣子也像中國人，他們是秦始皇的後代…這一次是「囘國」來「動匪」……所以應該擁護……』</p>
<p>「……現在中國爲什麼不太平？就是因爲蔣介石赤化了，聽共產黨的話，投亂社會治安，『皇軍』爲了保護人民，才同他們打……，</p>
<p>『……編保甲，是爲了防止搗亂份子，保護良民安居樂業，因此，他們超織甚麼『防共靑年團』，「防共自衛　」，『反英聯合會』，加上過去已有的「大民會」……之類，以汪逆精衛的言論興近街的宜言作為「理論的根据，「大作共「三反』工作。</p>
<p>從四月一號起，便開始發安居證，以保甲爲單位，要塡申請書，要塡二寸半身相兩張；當然又要化一筆冤枉錢，保甲則在以前便恢復了，据漢奸的「蕪湖新報」上登載，已經編好的保有二百四十保，甲有二千四百十五甲。</p>
<p>以上的兒花樣，你以爲老百姓們不懂囑？哼，有一年多經騐敎訓的中國人民，誰都知道，「反英」是爲了轉移「抗日」的目標，威脅英國不予我們以帮助，『反蔣反共」用不着說，是日寇一味的口號與陰謀，所謂甚麼團甚麼會以及編保甲，完全是×人的欺　。完全是敵人在蕪湖，在各地多次抽丁，遭受失敗的新手段，因此老百姓們對付他們的方法是「兩頭派」，一方面敷衍敷衍×人，用各種方法拖延敵人編保甲的企圖；一方面則盡可能的掩護在蕪湖活動的中國「格伯鳥」，並設法將各種消息傳達國軍及環繞　湖的游　隊，也設法打聽我們抗戰的正確消息　——到現在大部份蕪湖同胞，還不相信武漢失守，因爲他們只看見漢奸的之大勢宜　，以爲武漢失守是漢奸造的謠言；不眾老百姓中。是兩面派」。就是　×人股務的中國人，他們大部也是如此。只要我軍打勝仗，他們一定動搖，如果到反攻的時候，他們仍然可能是「道地的中國人！」下面的事，便是具體的證明；</p>
<p>四月四日，敵調二百歲十個「防共靑年　」團員到南京受訓，可是在途中全部逃去，一個不到！×人的「聯為保」也無法處施，因爲跑的大多，一設就是一大批，這對他的「懷柔政策』豈不是一個大笑話？誰能說，誰敢說；蕪湖完了？（完）</p>

<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我們接受下一份工作，從前代手中。</p>
<p>一部人類的歷吏。當是塗滿了奮鬥的血，有烈士的成仁、也有鬼蜮的腥腐，像龍與蛇相鬥，互相扭打了幾千萬年，光明與黑暗相互代位。沒有永遠的光明，也沒有永久的黑暗。</p>
<p>正義的人捨身奮鬥，從「邪惡」的手裏奪取光明。火種被「邪惡」者攫去了，於是宇宙淪爲地獄，幽深，黑暗，寒冽。沒有太陽，沒有月亮，沒有星斗沒有火光。怯弱的乃寒優如秋　，呻吟，泣訴，哀怨，悄悄地抑謬而死。勇敢者，堅貞者，明識者。不能屆辱於命運，乃各自攘臂而起，願以自己的血肉，委於山路；如是，搭成一座梧。好讓他們子孫渡過深調，跨越幽谷，　登山巔。</p>
<p>火　到乎了，「邪惡」的世界乃　於勇敢者，堅貞者，明識者，爭取光明者。</p>
<p>像蟄伏的蟲，默默地躱藏，「邪惡」並未絕跡。一有機會時，他將乘隙而起，從泥土中，從樹棋下。於是已死未滅的「邢惡」，勢將再生。人類歷史上，又重覩蛇龍與的爭鬥。</p>
<p>不曾斬斷「邪惡」的根。因此「正義」永遠不能安寗。光明騰上天空。黑暗又悄悄爬上大地；「道德」纔稍稍疲倦，小醜乃欲扼之以死；航於大海中「公理」的小舟，殘暴的鯉魚時想取來果腹。</p>
<p>「邪惡」永不改悔。往往姑息「邪　」的人，不久便爲邪惡所戕害。這時，助桀爲虐者，邪惡帮兇者，阿諛，殊不願再讚頌衰頹之正義。他們稱彼爲：懦怯者，無能者，天演淘汰者。</p>
<p>「邪惡」披猖時，我們易受傳染興襲擊，因此我們想築成一座正義的堡　用以捍衛。</p>
<p>千年來，我們感於祖宗留下的堡曼，一半毀壞，一半也欠牢固，「邪惡」時時可能入侵。雖然我們一時把他擊退了，但他並未絕滅。爲了長治久安，於是我們建起一個新的堡壘，更偉大，更堅固。</p>
<p>搭起高高的木架，擊下長長的繩索，再運用千鈞的磐石，用力下衝冲。我們衝，衝，打椿，—打　。給千萬年前，千萬年後的正義，打下一個基礎，深，厚，廣，永不動搖。</p>
<p>額上涔涔，手足也肼胝，這確然是一椿苦事。我們的前代不曾做，我們的友人不曾做，多難的我們却以鐵似的雙肩來承擔了。</p>
<p>「假使自衛的話，那末赶走「邪惡」爲巳足，你又何必再做一個更偉大，更堅固的堡壘呢？』有人議笑我們太多事，不知取巧。但我們不管這些。我們甘願捨身，爭取永久的正義，庇及自己，更庇及友人；給自己打算，更爲我們的子孫。</p>
<p>不僅奠下更深更厚的基礎，而且我們遠須與「邪惡」短兵相接，廓淸敗北的　沙，吹滅寒灰的星火。給千萬年的宇宙，瀘成一泓淸水，剔去那些永遠的沉寂。</p>
<p>雖然我們前代也會有過一個堡壘，也曾驅逐過「邪惡」，但現在堡壘已快傾圯了，『邪惡』仍未絕滅。邊往的人過去了，帶走笑，帶走眼淚，睛天與陰天，悲哀與幸福，留下杜若的芳香，也留下篷高的薰臭。『正義』的墻壁豎起了，『邪惡』的蛇乃又攪動，搖搖然，搖　然。你不看見，封豕與　蛇，時時倫覷着我們　想二口吞下光明？你說，我們能再苟安嗎？</p>
<p>不是苟安，也不是退後的時俟了。即使一星星火，也能够燎原，「邪惡」埋發的土地，那兒人類永遠不能安寗。</p>
<p>掘發了你那兒的埋藏，捕獲。毀滅你地下的「邪惡」築起深牢的堡壘，爲了別人，也爲你自己。</p>
<p>洗淸千千萬萬年的宇宙，不留一點「邪惡」的渣滓已死的腥腐，從「　往」墳墓中洗凈，遺擊的殘餘，我們再把『令天』的面具撕毀。</p>
<p>追奔逐北時，我們做先鋒；建築堡壘時，我們第一個高高舉起打椿的礎口。</p>
<p>撤下「正義」的種子，終有一日開花，爲世界的人類祝福我來們築一個幸福的堡壘。</p>
<p>在前代「邪惡」並未絕滅，我們的工作務須超道前代，使其永不再生。</p>

<p>『不，有一本琴譜。』</p>
<p>『啊，還有一把尖刀！』</p>
<p>他並不是有意說的，而使趨雖　。但越紅了說，她的臉頰紅得像親塗了胭脂；遺憾是難忘的。她稚氣地打了他一掌，制止他再提起「尖刀」的兩字。</p>
<p>雪不斷地　落，隨處都　雪落滿了。街邊積起無　的雪堆，雪山；雪路狹了。巳經　礙着人和車的行進。早晨新掃的行人的雪徑，又祇雪封閉了。他們脚下拖着的積雪，高過腳腕，幾乎浸入套鞋。</p>
<p>暴風的吼聲，可以聽到很遠的地方，風中，彷彿藏着無數的鋼針，刺透　他們臉面的每個毛孔；但他們不曾覺得，因爲他們的血熱；而目懷着一種熱望。這熟望，可以壓服寒帶的冰冷。</p>
<p>街上的行人很少，馬車和雪比較多些；馬蹄後的毛上結了無數的冰　，跑起路的時候，響得像銅鈴，加以禮拜堂的鐘聲，在她聽來，遺是住目那設優美的昔樂，祇有她的眼睛，經不住雪地的反射；這雪地，彷彿比往日多了飛散的金星</p>
<p>『快到家了吧？』</p>
<p>他望着一條街信的盡頭，不住地閃着　請——披雪地反射得看不淸晣：所以問了他。他看了看，告訴她還有一半的路程。她又問：</p>
<p>『你想送我到宗嗎？』</p>
<p>『當然！』</p>
<p>『那你到我家坐坐再走不好嗎？』</p>
<p>『奇怪，我怎麼還可以到你家？你家那　多嘴的老太婆不認識我嗎？』</p>
<p>『有我，你怕什麼？』</p>
<p>「不！」</p>
<p>他對於她家多話的女僕，仍有所顧慮。</p>
<p>然而，遇見了她；而且，跟隨着幾個偵探。她一見朱琳，便忽略了雨文，隨着。她的話就開始了：</p>
<p>『小姐！我可眞想死你　，我這三天就好像過了三十年！呀，我的頭髮都白唆！——』</p>
<p>朱琳如果不制止她，她的話，是不會中斷的。朱琳望着地和幾個偵標，不覽茫然起來。</p>
<p>然後，女俟告訴朱琳，現在偵探已經　出破果的線索，正去遠捕犯人；並要　去認出那個　架朱琳的首犯。</p>
<p>朱琳虛偽地嘆了一聲，地說：</p>
<p>『現在遲了！』　（六八）</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Brief Discussion on the Fake "Huaxing Bank" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The "Huaxing Bank," jointly established by puppet organizations in Central China instigated by Japan and various Japanese banks, was announced in Shanghai a few days ago. It is rumored that it will soon issue counterfeit currency to seize the Chinese legal tender currently circulating in Japanese-occupied areas. Japan's aim is to disrupt China's wartime finance and realize its so-called "yen bloc." Last year, it issued fake "United Reserve Bank" ("Lian Yin") banknotes under the name of the so-called "United Reserve Bank." The value of these counterfeit banknotes is now plummeting. According to a recent Reuters dispatch, the premium for exchanging counterfeit banknotes in North China for legal tender has reached 34.5%. Based on this example, it is not difficult to foresee the future of the so-called "Huaxing Bank."</p>
<p>It is very difficult to establish a country's currency system, and it is also not easy to destroy it. Given the solid foundation of China's legal tender system and the loyalty of the people to their country, any financial conspiracy by Japan will not yield unexpected gains. This has been proven by the failure of the counterfeit banknotes in North China. Moreover, Japan's attempt to destroy China's legal tender system is just that, an attempt, and it has no real ability to do so. The failure of counterfeit banknotes in North China was due to the existence of a name without substance, making it impossible to obtain foreign exchange. The counterfeit banknotes about to be issued in Central China will also have no so-called reserves. Some may think that they will use Japanese yen as reserves, but the amount of Japanese domestic currency issued had already ballooned to 2.9 billion yen by the end of last year, and most of the currency reserves have been spent on purchasing military supplies. If counterfeit banknotes in Central China are backed by Japanese yen, it will indirectly accelerate the expansion of Japanese currency. Some may think that they will use foreign currency as reserves, but with anti-aggression movements underway in various democratic countries, who would be willing to bear the responsibility of helping aggression? Japan's international credit is now so low that there is no guarantee of support for Chinese counterfeit banknotes, let alone loans for so-called industrial construction. Under Japan's current policy of excluding European and American interests in China, the door to borrowing has long been closed. It is rumored that last year, the puppet Manchukuo tried to borrow ten million dollars from American businesses for railway equipment, but this was rejected by the United States. Some may think that counterfeit banknotes will be exchanged for legal tender, and the legal tender reserves will be used as reserves. This is Japan's hope, but in reality it is extremely slim, because the Chinese government has long imposed very strict controls on foreign exchange. Some may think that foreign exchange from exporting goods can be used as reserves. This is possible, but how can one quench thirst by looking at plums? What are the real reserves except for the guns and knives of Japanese soldiers?</p>
<p>In fact, Japan knows that the counterfeit banknotes in North China cannot destroy China's legal tender system. The counterfeit banknotes in Central China will be no different from those in North China, and will have absolutely no ability to compete with Chinese legal tender. However, at a time when the people are impoverished and the country is financially exhausted, Japan, in order to achieve its illusory dream of creating a new order in East Asia, has no choice but to adopt this method of issuing counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, Japan's instigation of puppet organizations to gradually expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance is not to establish a foundation for any currency system for the puppet organizations. The issuance of counterfeit banknotes, in relation to the puppet organizations, is at most that when Japan is economically unable to provide assistance, the puppet organizations can borrow an economic blood debt in the military-occupied areas. Japan's real purpose is to take advantage of the convenience of the yen bloc, on the one hand, to extract the blood and sweat of the people in the guerrilla areas of China as much as possible to temporarily support the war against China; on the other hand, to control foreign exchange based on counterfeit banknotes and to try to exclude all European and American power in China.</p>
<p>The only role that counterfeit banknotes have in the guerrilla areas of China now is to facilitate trade with Japan, that is, to use counterfeit banknotes to forcibly purchase goods in the guerrilla areas, transport them for export, obtain foreign exchange, and control it. Export merchants must sell their foreign exchange to the puppet banks, and import merchants must obtain foreign exchange in advance. This is how it is done in North China. For example, last year, Japan's trade with North China, both imports and exports, doubled compared to the previous year. At the same time, it can also use Chinese goods that Japan does not need to exchange for various raw materials needed by the Japanese military. For example, the so-called list of priority import goods established by the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in North China is entirely for the use of the Japanese military. Conversely, European and American countries' trade with North China is either restricted by Japan or has no profit to be made, so the trade volume has decreased greatly. Now, in order to obtain more raw materials and a larger market, and in order to more actively exclude the rights and interests of European and American countries in China, Japan will naturally expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance to the Central China region.</p>
<p>The Chinese government had already taken precautions against Japan's attempt, prohibiting the free flow of goods between the mainland and the guerrilla areas, improving and reorganizing local finance in the war zones, and the guerrillas' severe punishment of those who use counterfeit banknotes. These are all effective ways to deal with Japan's issuance of counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, Japan's attempt to issue counterfeit banknotes in Central China this time has limited ability to destroy Chinese legal tender. In terms of the current actual situation, the circulation of counterfeit banknotes in Central China in the future will generally be limited to a few larger cities directly controlled by Japanese military force. The Chinese people living in these areas and the European and American merchants engaged in foreign trade in the Central China area will be greatly affected, especially the latter, who may encounter the same environment as in North China. This is what European and American expatriates in China should pay special attention to. At the time of the establishment of the puppet Huaxing Bank, it is said that the Chinese and foreign banks and money shops in Shanghai decided not to cooperate. This is an inevitable measure for the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to protect their own economic interests in Central China.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Reports from Vietnam <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xi, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper</p>
<p>(1) The Reaction to the Intrusion of × Planes into French Annam's Airspace</p>
<p>April 13</p>
<p>When the No. 19 mail plane of the Luoge Asia Airline was near He Kou, it was rumored to have intruded into French Annam's airspace. The French people here are quite indignant about this. Currently, more and more of them are expressing dissatisfaction with the weakness of France's Far East diplomatic policy. A French friend told us that the young French soldiers here, in view of Japan's repeated oppression, having already occupied Hainan Island, the Storm Islands, and now becoming even more aggressive, openly invading French Annam's airspace, are quite a few who advocate war against Japan because of this. Recently, a high-ranking officer of the French fleet stationed in Vietnam, someone, represented this opinion and strongly advocated taking military retaliation against Japan. However, this is of course impossible in the current state of affairs, so he was regarded as an extremist and recently transferred elsewhere. From this, we can also see that although France is now more willing to take the path of opposing aggression, it is still very limited.</p>
<p>(2) The Political Director of the Annam Governor-General's Office Transferred</p>
<p>On the 26th (?), the newspapers in the Japanese-controlled area all published the news that Mr. Grandfean, the Political Director of the Annam Governor-General's Office, was being transferred back to Europe. I think this news may be worth our attention. As far as we know, this political director is a famous "Japanophobe" here. It is said that when our "August 13th" War of Resistance broke out in Shanghai the year before last, he was ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate the war. Later, he returned to Annam and made a report, the general idea of which was that Japan's mechanized units were very powerful, their morale was very high, and their military discipline was very good. In short, he expressed his admiration for Japan. As for China, he said that it was simply completely hopeless. Not only were the weapons obsolete, but there was no organization at all. Even some new mechanized weapons could not be used, and when they saw the × people coming, they had no choice but to abandon the machines and "flee for their lives." Therefore, he advocated that in order to preserve France's Far East interests, it must compromise with Japan. This report of his became the basis for France's rather long-term policy of compromise with Japan. Let us not criticize the ridiculousness of his ignorance and shallowness. Let us say that under the leadership of this political director, after the fall of Hanzhou, Annam, after being slightly threatened by a few arrogant words from Japan, immediately implemented a blockade of the border between China and France and stopped the transportation of military supplies to our country on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. They attempted to obtain temporary security by compromising and retreating from Japan. However, the facts were completely different. Japan instead occupied Hainan Island and the French-owned Storm Islands, and even openly violated France's Annam airspace. These facts completely shattered Grandjean's short-sighted views. At a time when the anti-aggression united front movements of countries such as Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly active and close to gradual completion, France has transferred this old gentleman back to Europe. It must be related to the changes in France's overall foreign policy.</p>
<p>(3) French Newspaper Reports That Our Consul in Saigon Is ×'s New Secretary</p>
<p>A few days ago, the local French newspaper La Vonlonte Indochinoire reported that after the death of Mr. Zeng ××, a certain consul of our country in Saigon took over the position of private secretary of ×××. Later, it was rumored that when the consul studied in France in the past, he had accepted personal subsidies from ×. It is not impossible that he would do such a thing today. The above records and rumors are closely related. It is unknown whether they are true. If they are not true, we believe that the consul should immediately publish a statement in the newspaper to clarify the facts. At the same time, we also hope that our government will immediately and thoroughly investigate the matter to find out the truth and take action.</p>
<p>(4) Certain Civil Servants' Corrupt Behavior in Vietnam</p>
<p>Since Wuhan and Guangzhou successively fell, and international routes shifted to Annam, various military and political departments of our country followed suit and established offices here, and many civil servants also came here. Among the civil servants sent to serve here, there are indeed those who can maintain their integrity, act in the public interest, and defend the country, but there are also many who are not satisfactory. The local overseas Chinese, witnessing the extravagant and corrupt lives of civil servants entering and leaving dance halls, brothels, and bars at will here, express infinite indignation. We feel that this phenomenon needs to be corrected urgently. Because overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about loving their country, it is a major driving force for our current war of resistance. We must not disappoint them and reduce or even eliminate their patriotic enthusiasm. Recently, a famous overseas Chinese gentleman here told reporters that he had heard that a civil servant went to a foreign firm in Hanoi to buy an old Ford car. The price was agreed to be 2,500 yuan, but the civil servant insisted that the firm's office write 3,500 yuan on the invoice, making the firm confused and unwilling to agree. The civil servant said sternly: "If you can act according to my opinion, then I can help you buy three more. Otherwise, I will go to another place to trade immediately, and I don't want even this one!" In this way, of course, there is no more problem. The firm obeyed for the sake of safety. It is said that this news is very true. Reporters have heard many similar incidents. For example, in order to avoid being reported for corruption, civil servants are unwilling to trade with overseas Chinese and are mostly willing to pay high prices to do business with foreigners. This is a good example. We believe that regardless of whether these incidents are true or not, we hope that our civil servants will all take the meaning of "correcting mistakes if they exist and being encouraged if they don't," and instead create many extraordinary and glorious examples for us, so that the overseas Chinese here will have a fresh impression!</p>
<p>(5) Friction between Overseas Chinese and Annamese People Under the Conspiracy of × People</p>
<p>More than two months ago, this reporter saw a document issued by our consulate in Hanoi advising overseas Chinese not to create disputes with the Annamese people, so as not to be provoked by × people to sow discord and undermine our war of resistance. It is said that recently, overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong have still not been able to completely avoid disputes such as quarrels and fights with the Annamese people. This is truly a great pity! The cause of these disputes may seem to be due to the fault of the Annamese people on the surface. However, our overseas Chinese should adhere to the great principle that our motherland's war of resistance today must strive to win foreign aid, and give up all anger. As the ancients said, "A small impatience will ruin a big plan." What's more, these disputes are actually caused by the instigation and provocation of an agent. Compatriots, let us not be fooled! We should try to win the sympathy of the Annamese people. Haven't the Vietnamese overseas Chinese in Yunnan and the Annamese people here donated money to help our war of resistance? According to what reporters have heard, there are also Annamese people who voluntarily report information about × people to us. Especially the Annamese communists, because they witnessed the purchase of Vietnamese drivers by × people to drive and transport gasoline for us within Vietnam, secretly dumped or sold the gasoline. And they voluntarily took responsibility for supervising us. These things are so touching to us! As for their verbal sympathy for us and hatred for Japan, they are another matter.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, there is something even more heartbreaking for us! According to reports, in a place called Hongge (Hougay), located 70 kilometers (each kilometer is about 1.7 li in our country) northeast of Haiphong, a major dispute between the Chinese and Vietnamese recently occurred. Hongge is a mining area, and most of the miners are Annamese, and there are also some overseas Chinese. The area is adjacent to the sea and is a strategic location in military terms. It is said that if × people invade the north of Annam in the future, that place will be one of the places where both sides must compete for victory or defeat. Therefore, × people are very active there. It is said that this dispute was caused by a fight between Chinese and Vietnamese children. Later, the parents of the Chinese children showed favoritism and lightly beat the Vietnamese children. As a result, the Vietnamese miners gathered a crowd to fight the Chinese, and the local Chinese also gathered to clash with them. The number of participants even reached more than a thousand. Later, fortunately, the police suppressed the situation and arrested a number of people from both sides, and the situation stopped. It is no accident that a small incident has expanded to such a scale. It can be asserted that the background must be the conspiracy and provocation of × people! It is a pity that our overseas Chinese are ignorant and have been poisoned by × people! When reporters write here, they feel that these things cannot be ignored, and it is by no means effective with a single document from a line consul. It is necessary to hope that our local overseas Chinese groups and youth workers for national salvation can come out to conduct more of this kind of propaganda and education, expose the conspiracy of × people's challenges, and carry out a planned movement to stop the continued development of this friction situation. At this point, the reporter cannot help but shout to our overseas Chinese again: Compatriots, let us not be fooled by × people!</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the Recent Charity Painting Exhibition in Haiphong</p>
<p>A painter named Huang recently held a personal painting exhibition in the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, selling his paintings at high prices. The price of each painting is often dozens of yuan, and some are as high as sixty yuan! However, in terms of the content of the paintings, they are nothing more than old-fashioned paintings depicting the scenery, flowers, moon, birds, animals, plants, etc., which have more than enough propaganda for elegance, but not only are they insufficient to encourage national salvation, but it is simply impossible to talk about. So why can he sell his paintings so well? It is said that half of the income from each painting, excluding expenses, is to be donated to the government for the war of resistance. He uses the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese, so he can sell his paintings so well. A gentleman from the overseas Chinese said to me: If he sells a painting worth ten yuan for sixty yuan, donates thirty yuan to the government, isn't he still making a fortune of twenty yuan from the national crisis? I said: I don't know your "humor," only the painter knows!</p>
<p>(7) × People's Propaganda Work for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>× people recently sent propaganda to overseas Chinese in Haiphong and Hanoi from Guangzhou, door to door (presumably in other places as well). Not only are the street numbers and store numbers accurate, but even the names of the store owners are written clearly! What are they writing? "Guangzhou Minsheng Daily," "Japanese Osaka Chinese Daily," "South China Books and Newspapers," "Xiamen Pictorial," "Far East Monthly" - issued on February 1, Showa 14, etc. What is particularly noteworthy is the stinky article "Wang Jingwei's Recent Important Remarks - to Give an Example" printed on special paper. The "Guangzhou Minsheng Daily" solemnly reprinted it and specially wrote an editorial saying: "Crush the dreams of those who advocate war and oppose peace." From this, we can know the thoroughness of × people's propaganda work and the urgency of × people's desire for peace. They want to use this to shake the patriotic enthusiasm of our overseas Chinese. Who knows that the facts are completely beyond their expectations? The overseas Chinese immediately tore them up when they received them and did not even want to take a look. Some even said to the postman, this thing is not ours, take it back. They are unwilling to take it in order to preserve the purity of their patriotic enthusiasm!</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Financial Situation in Beijing and Tianjin Under Japanese Control <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>(May 1, Beijing Correspondence) The North China Daily News recently published an article by its Tokyo correspondent, stating that the Japanese authorities are currently drafting a great plan to develop gold mining on the border of Rehe and Manchukuo. It also stated that the gold obtained will be used to increase the resources of the newly established "United Reserve Bank" in Beijing and help to establish control over the financial situation in North China and expand foreign trade in the region. If the bank's hope of increasing its resources lies only in this aspect, then this kind of assistance will have to wait to be obtained, because currently, due to the continued sharp decline in the value of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, there is a serious monetary crisis in North China. At the time this reporter was writing, "United Reserve Bank" banknotes were exchanged for legal tender at a discount of more than 35%. The decline continues day by day. The monetary issue is really the only topic of discussion here in recent days, even to the point of ignoring the war situation. The residents of Beijing are now worried and talking to each other in low voices, saying, "The new currency is going to be worthless." They seem quite alarmed, which reduces the credibility of those so-called financiers, because those who know the content of "United Reserve Bank" have always been sure that this kind of banknote without any reserves will not know how the Japanese declaration and bayonets can give it value. The public's panic is justified for several reasons, because we have now seen the signs of financial chaos. Such as the rise in the cost of living, stores raise the prices of various goods every day, necessities such as flour and kerosene, and all imported goods, are all rising in price. A bag of 40 pounds of American flour, which could be obtained for six yuan three weeks ago, now costs seven yuan and two cents. Railway fares have almost doubled, and return tickets cannot be purchased. Even the local taxes have been increased several times. Several foreign stores have recently started to price their goods in pounds or gold dollars. The free exchange of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes for Japanese yen at par has been restricted, and now the restrictions are even tighter. Only Japanese stores with special permission can obtain a limited amount of Japanese yen from the Yokohama Specie Bank. There are various reasons for the depreciation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. One explanation is that foreigners import a large amount of flour into North China, and now importers have to use foreign exchange, which can only be obtained with legal tender. However, the Japanese have promulgated regulations to implement searches and confiscations, which has forced legal tender to circulate formally. Therefore, unless with a very high premium, a large amount of legal tender cannot be obtained. This is one reason, but not all reasons are in this. Although this can explain the rise in the price of a small number of goods and the reason for the considerable premium on legal tender, this theory does not take into account the sudden and drastic decline in the value of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes and the general mistrust. It is rumored that the Japanese bridges in North China are willing to pay any price to purchase legal tender. This is one example. Many believe that this is caused by the continuous depreciation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, and the rumors that the Japanese yen is about to be devalued have made people even more uneasy. The "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, which are currently worth about six pence and five farthings, can be exchanged for Japanese yen, which is officially priced at one shilling and two farthings, at any price, but the amount is limited. From this fact, the current financial chaos here can be clearly understood. Observers who are watching similar financial oddities in other parts of the world with cold eyes are now discovering that Chinese merchants who only a few months ago were demanding payment in "United Reserve Bank" banknotes are now eagerly asking customers if they can pay in legal tender again. Or seeing shops that had previously firmly announced that they only accepted "United Reserve Bank" banknotes are now reissuing notices stating that they will price their goods in a certain gold coin in the future. It should not be surprising at all. Many Japanese are talking about the need to take "resolute measures," but even the Japanese military's finances cannot explain what kind of boldness can give value to a worthless currency. There are also suggestions to stop the import of all goods into North China. This move may temporarily prevent "United Reserve Bank" banknotes from continuing to fall, but it is only temporary and will only increase financial chaos. Because the implementation of this move will cut off the sources of several necessities that cannot be obtained from Japan, the cost of living will continue to rise, which will have an unfavorable impact on the Japanese yen and will lead to widespread smuggling. The exchange rate of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes will still not be resolved. Products from most of the mainland, such as cotton, peanuts, eggs, etc., still have to be paid for in legal tender, and since the amount of legal tender is small, it gradually rises in premium. Finally, even today, it is still doubtful whether restricting imports can restore confidence in the unprepared "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. The only sound method is to admit failure and gradually withdraw this new currency, just as when a large amount of Japanese yen flowed into China last year. However, this is only a suggestion and will certainly not be adopted by the Japanese. In view of the disastrous failure of the Japanese currency experiment in North China, and the Japanese military financial experts still decided to use a new currency that is "independent" in Central China, it is even more obvious that there is no hope of accepting advice.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Germany Prepares to Attack <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— By Mrs. Tabouis</p>
<p>From studying the mission of Göring and Goebbels abroad, we can draw an ominous conclusion.</p>
<p>Göring is preparing an attack on the democracies, an attack launched by the Berlin, Rome, Tokyo, and Burgos axis.</p>
<p>Goebbels is preparing an advancement on Göring's plan, that is to say, Hitler has ordered him to execute two new propaganda programs now that Göring's mission has been completed.</p>
<p>Göring has now gone to Italy, which is equivalent to a German colony, (note that Göring has already returned to Germany) to supervise the management of Italian troops. Italian troops, from the smallest units to the largest forces, will be attended by German technical experts and officers, creating a manipulative situation. The German Wehrmacht has already mobilized and concentrated troops on the border of the Alps.</p>
<p>For a time, Italian Chief of Staff General Pariani opposed handing over this border to the German army, but in the end, Göring prevailed.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the German forces concentrated on this border now number about 100,000.</p>
<p>At the same time, after inspecting Italy's airfields, Göring is now transferring more German air force units to Italy. He believes that the air defenses of Italian coastal cities and Rome are insufficient and should be remedied by the German air force.</p>
<p>He said that Italy's military supplies and heavy artillery should also be enhanced by German technical experts.</p>
<p>Finally, he went from Calabria to Tripoli to inspect the Italian troops in Libya, checking whether it was possible for them to launch a rapid attack on French territories. General Balbo, the Italian resident in Libya, said that to do so, they would need another 300,000 men.</p>
<p>Göring has also prepared to deploy 60,000 German troops to Rhodes in the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey. These troops are fully armed and equipped as an expeditionary force. Where will they advance? Against Syria, Egypt, or Palestine? No one knows yet, but Greece has already been greatly alarmed by their movements.</p>
<p>Göring has been actively cooperating with Berlin in dispatching these German colonial troops to Libya. Last week, 28,000 German soldiers passed through Italy to Libya.</p>
<p>At the same time, the German Colonial Office, following Göring's instructions, has ordered the conscription of colonial doctors and officials, asking them to sign contracts stipulating that they and their families can be transferred abroad by the end of June and take up new positions in mid-July.</p>
<p>According to secret orders from the Colonial Office, Germany will have recovered some of its old colonies by that time.</p>
<p>While in Italy, Göring had frequent long-distance telephone calls with Hitler day and night. As a counterattack against the Anglo-Polish alliance, he and Hitler agreed on a new plan to attack Poland, preparing for German troops to enter Poland at two points: the Polish Corridor and Silesia. The German side believes that Poland will not resist, or, in any case, if Germany agrees not to attack French territory, France will not intervene.</p>
<p>This is the plan put forward by Göring and Hitler. In other words, Göring is now organizing the four countries of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain to launch a fierce attack on the democracies.</p>
<p>General Franco, that is, the Italian and German troops in Spain, will attack the British forces in Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Italian troops will launch their offensive in Libya and Tunisia, combined with air raids on British and French naval and land forces in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>German troops will make a large-scale attack through the Netherlands, while simultaneously entering the Polish Corridor and Silesia.</p>
<p>Hitler and Göring decided that if they launched a fierce and rapid military offensive, the democracies would be willing to concede and agree to the demands of the Axis powers, and would not dare to break out into a terrible war.</p>
<p>Göring is the most hated person in Italy, because his military officers manipulate Italy. They wear two badges, one is the Nazi swastika badge, and the other says "Italian Army." These officers treat the Italian people with arrogance and abuse.</p>
<p>The anger of the Italian people is obvious. The famous futurist Marinetti said: "I am in favor of the Rome-Berlin Axis, I believe in the Berlin-Rome Axis, but as for the kind of Berlin Axis imagined by General Göring, even if you take our lives, I will not agree with it or believe in it!"</p>
<p>Goebbels' mission in the Balkans and the Levant (the general term for the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, from western Greece to western Egypt) is another aspect of the situation. Hitler ordered him to prepare two propaganda plans, one for use in a major war, and the other for use when the democracies surrender.</p>
<p>Goebbels went abroad with many of his propaganda department staff, and recruited new people in Athens, the Balkans, and other countries of the Levant.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, at a meeting of the Propaganda Department presided over by Hitler, he rudely told Goebbels: "The current propaganda methods are of no use to Germany's goals. Göring already has his army orders. Now it's up to you to have a new propaganda plan for the glorious days to come."</p>

<h3 id="e5">Our Army Achieves Great Victory East of Xiangfan × Army Suffers Casualties Exceeding 30,000 A Certain Officer Leads Troops Across the Xiang River to Attack <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 7th] The × invading central Hubei, according to their serial numbers, consist of three divisions. Two divisions and a cavalry brigade attacked north from the Hanyi Road, while one division advanced along the Hua-Xiang Road towards the left flank, vying for control with us in fierce and bloody battles. Since a certain officer of our army led his troops across the river to attack north, they have achieved numerous victories in recent days. Yesterday, they routed 3,000 × troops on the Haozigang and Tianjiaji routes, killing more than 1,000 × troops, seizing a large number of weapons, horses, military supplies, and documents, and capturing a × army officer named Matsui.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] In the Xia County, Wenxi, and Anyi areas of southern Shanxi, we have launched continuous attacks on the × troops, killing several hundred. Southern Hebei is under our control. We killed two to three hundred × troops near Nangong and Daming previously.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guilin, 17th] Our × troops are still in a standoff with the × troops near Wuning and north of Gaoan in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>The situation on the eastern bank of the Gan River and the Fu River is calm.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] According to Chinese sources, there have been 416 battles on various fronts between China and Japan in the first half of May. The Japanese army suffered 12,0475 casualties, of which 105 battles were in Shanxi Province. The battles in Hubei Province were particularly fierce, with 12,781 Japanese troops killed and 18 Japanese aircraft destroyed, not including those shot down from the air.</p>
<p>Our Military Authorities Refute × Propaganda</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Recently, the × side has repeatedly broadcast that they have surrounded more than 20 divisions of our army, totaling 150,000 men, near Zaoyang, and have annihilated them. When asked about this news, military authorities all laughed and said that our army, based on its consistent strategy of protracted attrition warfare, avoids decisive battles with the × troops. Our troops have retreated in due course in advance of the × army's self-proclaimed encirclement operation. Even most of the civilians in the area have been evacuated, leaving no one within the encirclement. Therefore, if reporters stationed in Shanghai and Tokyo ask the × army spokesperson about the fruits of the × army's victory in this encirclement, such as how many prisoners were captured and how many spoils of war were seized, even the × army spokesperson, who is best at fabrication, will be at a loss for words. Moreover, after the × army surged northward from ×× to ××, they were met with a head-on blow from our Tang Army Corps from the north, and the × army collapsed and fled south. If ×× is outside the × army's encirclement, the × side broadcast the next day that it was shrinking the encirclement. Although the × army has repeatedly stated that Tang Enbo's army has been surrounded and annihilated, who was it that inflicted a painful blow on the × army at ××? And why did the × army, which won the victory on the Huayuan-Xiangfan Road, abandon its countless wounded soldiers along the way without taking care of them? Perhaps only the trees, houses, and plants on the Tongbai Mountain and Dabie Mountain, which cannot move, were unable to resist the × army's encirclement. Moreover, in the battles east of Xiangfan, the × army suffered more than 30,000 casualties, a number far greater than our army's.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to a spokesman for the Chinese military headquarters, due to the fierce fighting in central Hubei Province, the Japanese army has had to rush troops from all sides to reinforce it, so the fighting on other fronts has been suspended. The fighting near Suixian is relatively fierce, making it extremely difficult to obtain accurate information. However, the Japanese propaganda that twenty divisions of the Chinese army have been trapped is completely groundless. The spokesman also said that the Japanese army's goal is Xiangyang, and they are also attempting to cut off the retreat of the Chinese army in the area, but so far they have not succeeded. Recently, a thousand cavalrymen set out from Zhongxiang and advanced north, but were driven back to the east bank of the Han River. The Japanese army originally had four divisions, but now half of them have been transferred to northern Hubei, because most of the war zone is mountainous, making it difficult for the Japanese army's mechanized units to transport supplies, resulting in heavy casualties. In the past week, the Japanese army suffered about 6,000 casualties. The fighting near Xinye and Tanghe is even more fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides. Tanghe was once lost, but was soon recaptured by the Chinese army. After losing Tanghe, the Japanese army reinforced it with 3,000 troops, and the Chinese army also transferred troops from Nanyang to help. The two armies are now in a standoff southeast of Tanghe. Currently, only the front line of Suixian is experiencing a major battle, and in each melee, the Japanese army suffers heavier casualties, while the Chinese army suffers few losses. Even after investigating after the Japanese aircraft's frenzied bombing. Finally, the spokesman said that it would take three months to determine who would win or lose. The Chinese army is now preparing to counterattack. If they fail to succeed, they will retreat to Xiangyang. But in any case, the Japanese army is powerless to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army.</p>
<p>× Reinforces Shanxi Province Makes a Last-Ditch Effort</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] A Chinese military official told an Associated Press reporter that the Japanese army is now planning to send coarsely trained divisions to the five districts of Shanxi Province to assist the independent divisions in each district in combat. The purpose of this plan is to make a final effort to "pacify" the Eighth Route Army guerrillas. This "pacification" work is the main strategy of the Japanese army in order to maintain the transportation lines in the Northwest and to serve as a base for future attacks on Xi'an and Lanzhou. However, the Japanese army's plan will inevitably fail, because the Chinese guerrillas are strong and have superb tactics, and the Japanese army's scattered forces are not enough to encircle the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Active on Wanshou Mountain in Western Hebei</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] A dispatch from outside Beiping reports that Chinese guerrillas are increasingly active in the suburbs of Beiping. The number of refugees fleeing to Beiping from the Huailai area is increasing. It is heard that the Japanese army is fighting fiercely with the Chinese army in Huailai, north of Nankou. Recently, a fierce battle broke out between the Japanese and Chinese armies near the Catholic Church of Fatian on Wanshou Mountain in western Hebei, resulting in a major defeat for the Japanese army and many casualties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 17th] According to reliable travelers, a Japanese regiment near a French monastery west of Beiping invaded the Eighth Route Army's defense zone several days ago and was completely intercepted and suffered many deaths.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] In recent days, conflicts have been constantly occurring near Lake Ber between the Japanese-puppet Manchurian forces and the Outer Mongolian army. It is heard that the Outer Mongolian army once crossed the border, using aircraft and heavy artillery to attack the Japanese garrison and the puppet Manchurian army in fierce battles for several hours. The Outer Mongolian army then retreated to its defensive positions. The number of Japanese and Manchurian troops stationed in the area has now been greatly increased to prevent the recurrence of incidents.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 15th] After the reorganization of the Guilin Provincial Party Headquarters, it is adjusting the entire structure and drafting a work plan. The guiding committees originally set up in the county party headquarters have been uniformly changed to executive committees, and each committee has appointed three to five members to form a finance review committee to perform review duties. The work of recruiting party members has begun and is expected to recruit 20,000 people within the year.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Recently, the × side has suffered repeated defeats on various fronts, and its domestic economic resources and military strength are unable to maintain the situation. Therefore, it is fabricating rumors in Tokyo, attempting to distort international information and reduce anti-war sentiment at home. When bombing our capital Chongqing a few days ago, it arbitrarily dropped bombs on foreign embassies and churches. Afterwards, it falsely claimed that there were our anti-aircraft positions near the embassies and consulates in an attempt to shirk responsibility. Due to the condemnation of gentlemen and scholars in Chongqing and the protests of Britain and the United States, it was unable to answer. Now, Tokyo is spreading rumors that Ding Jianxu, a division commander of our army in northern Jiangxi, has been captured by the × troops and made a speech in the × army. Its trick of fabricating lies is even more ridiculous. According to military authorities, Ding Jianxu is a brigade commander of our army, loyal and brave, and has repeatedly made outstanding achievements. The × troops fear him like a tiger. He is currently working hard to kill the × troops. How can he be captured? The × side is at wit's end and attempts to spread rumors to deceive its people, but it does not know that it is only accelerating its collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e13">National Production Conference Chairman Chiang's Instructions (3) <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Should meet current needs. We should rush to manufacture what is necessary. The most urgent need at present is for armaments and all military supplies. Our various factories must strive to improve the quality of national defense products. Secondly, we must, in light of the convenience of raw materials and transportation, enable a certain region to develop a certain leading product, and at the same time be able to divide labor and cooperate. On the one hand, we concentrate our strength, and on the other hand, we lay the foundation for the balanced development of the national economy. Finally, transportation industry, which is closely related to national defense and general production, is receiving full attention from the government, but we also hope that entrepreneurs across the country will do their best to support it.</p>
<p>Third, we must develop inherent production and maintain national economic self-sufficiency. Our modern production must revitalize both agriculture and handicrafts. On the one hand, our country must build modern economic weapons. When modern weapons are insufficient, even the most primitive weapons must be used. Today is a great opportunity for us to revitalize native products. This is not only extremely important for maintaining the daily life of the people in the rear, but also of great significance in the occupied areas. The × people are looting funds and dumping × goods in the occupied areas. In addition to doing our best to protect our resources in the occupied areas, we must do our best to maintain our economic self-sufficiency and maintain our inherent production industries. That is to say, we must consolidate our economy at all times and in all places. The Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association has already started to do this work, which is a very good thing. We must also intensify our efforts in this area. We must have a strong economic fortress, and even more so a strong spiritual fortress, in order to enable everyone to resist the war, defend step by step, and achieve the goal of all-out resistance.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must study science and technology and improve the quality of production. Production and science cannot be separated. In the future, we must integrate production and scientific education to achieve the goal of integrating construction and education. In the past, our science was impractical and our production lacked technology, so that neither production nor science could develop. For example, today, we have many machines that rely entirely on imports, and many raw materials that we cannot manufacture ourselves. Once many raw materials are lacking, production will be panicked. Therefore, I hope that our entrepreneurs and scientists will cooperate sincerely, conduct joint research, give play to the creative spirit of our ancestors, study substitutes, study methods of manufacturing new raw materials from inherent raw materials, and improve the quality of products and establish a reputation for domestic products. We have already made a lot of progress in this area, but we must continue to exert our best efforts to create more amazing achievements. All inventions originate from needs. Today should be the time for us to give full play to our great creativity.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must practice economy and accumulate resources for national construction. Today, in the midst of extreme hardship, if we want to build, we must practice economy. Especially with regard to national defense resources, such as metals, power, liquid fuels, we must cherish them. A drop of oil is our blood, two inches of iron is our life, and a point of electrical current is our breath. We must save one point if we can. By extension, we must not allow the slightest waste of manpower, material resources, or time. In addition, we must save for ourselves those items and raw materials that can be exported and exchanged for foreign exchange, and exchange them for the materials we lack. In addition, all undertakings must not have unnecessary duplication or unnecessary competition, but must concentrate manpower and material resources, divide labor and cooperate, and move forward towards the great goal of prosperity and strength.

<h3 id="e14">Declaration of the National Production Conference <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] The National Production Conference has issued a declaration, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Resistance and nation-building, proceeding simultaneously," is the established national policy of the Central Government. Modern nations are based on three pillars: economy, education, and military force. "The victory or defeat of war depends on the sustained supply of economic power," is also the clear instruction of the Commander-in-Chief. Since the outbreak of the war, our country's military strength has grown stronger with each battle. Today's key task is to develop national production, so that the country's economic strength becomes increasingly substantial, and can be matched with this strong national military force to win the victory of the war of resistance and establish the foundation for nation-building. The government is mindful of this principle, and in order to review past work and promote future production, it has convened the National Production Conference. We, the participants, have overcome dangers and hardships to travel thousands of miles to attend the conference. We deeply appreciate the government's thoughtful plans for the country, and its important considerations for national construction. After seven days of detailed discussions, decisions have been made on various production issues. We respectfully offer our humble opinions for the government's reference in policy-making, and for discussion among our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Future Policy</p>
<p>China's economic construction has only progressed slowly despite decades of effort, and no significant results have been achieved. There are two main reasons for this: first, before the establishment of the National Government, although there was some construction, there was no plan; second, after the establishment of the National Government, although there was a plan, it was overshadowed by internal and external troubles, and no significant progress could be made. Now that the war of resistance has begun, the country is unified, internal troubles have been eliminated, and external troubles are also mired in difficulties. China's future economic policy should absolutely be based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, aim to solve the normal needs of the people's lives, and especially develop state capital, support private enterprises, promote cooperative movements, and at the same time prevent capital concentration, so that production enterprises are nationalized, people-oriented, and rationalized, in order to lay the foundation for the construction of a new China and cultivate the economic strength of the entire nation. The war of resistance and nation-building are related to the safety and survival of the nation. The government should, based on the principles of "military first, victory first, country above all, nation above all," plan the national production forces as a whole, so that all kinds of essential military and civilian supplies are produced in large quantities and continuously, to meet the needs of national defense and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. There should be an overall plan for the types and quality of products, and there must be close links between various production enterprises, so that the entire national economic production becomes a mobile whole with a system and organization. Since the basis for national revival lies in the hinterland of the southwest and northwest, economic construction in the rear is an urgent task that cannot be delayed. Before the war, the economic center of the country was in the east. In the years after the war, the economic center of the country will be in the west. Therefore, all economic construction in the rear today must be based on planned calculations. The participants of this conference believe that the overall national production policy in the future should take economic construction in the southwest and northwest as one of the central principles, which should be recognized by the entire country, from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Agriculture, Forestry, Industry, and Mining</p>
<p>Are the mainstays of production enterprises. Their scope is broad and they await planning. Let's first talk about agriculture and forestry. Since the outbreak of the war, the war zones have been devastated and the coastal areas have been ravaged. Future agricultural construction must not only actively develop agricultural production in the rear to make up for the losses in the war zones, but also strive to restore agriculture in the war zones to enhance the strength of the compatriots in the war zones to resist the war. We believe that the objectives of agricultural production in our country should be: internally, to realize planned and organized production, so that agriculture can cooperate with industry to coordinate the relationship between various production sectors; externally, to increase the export of agricultural products to improve our international economic status. The planning and implementation of this agricultural policy cannot be achieved without the collective efforts of a large number of professionals. Therefore, the central government should urgently establish an Agricultural Design Committee and give agricultural professionals the convenience to contribute their opinions at any time. At the same time, it should strengthen the agricultural administrative agencies, so that all departments related to agricultural improvement are subordinate to a unified administrative system and maintain close contact to assist in the implementation of policies. Immigration and land reclamation are important measures to increase production and relieve refugees. They are currently being carried out by the central government, local governments, and public and private organizations, but due to the lack of unified management, organization, and guidance, the results have not been significant. The government should also set up land reclamation management agencies to take special responsibility, delineate the scope of the reclamation areas, generously allocate funds for land reclamation, cultivate land reclamation talents, and establish state-run and provincial-run reclamation areas, in order to achieve the success of the land reclamation cause. In the border provinces, where the land is vast and the population is sparse, immigration and land reclamation are particularly important for border administration. Planting the roots and establishing the foundation should be planned in advance.</p>
<p>The Price of Agricultural Products</p>
<p>Directly affects the interests of farmers and indirectly affects agricultural production. Therefore, raising prices is the most effective way to increase production. In the future, the Agricultural Bank and the Trade Committee should consider the situation and purchase rice, wheat, tung oil, silk, tea, pork, fur, and other items in large quantities at higher prices, and improve the marketing of agricultural products to improve the economic situation of farmers and increase their production capacity. Many farmers in our country are unable to fully use fertilizers and labor to increase production due to lack of funds. In order to prosper agriculture, agricultural financial institutions should promptly provide long-term, medium-term, and short-term loans. The improvement of agricultural production technology is the main way to increase industrial production. The backwardness of agriculture in our country, the unscientific nature of technology, and the lack of widespread promotion are important reasons. In addition to the construction of farmland irrigation, which should be handled by the government as a whole, various agricultural agencies should focus on crop breeding and cultivation, silkworm and livestock breeding, pest and disease control, effective use of fertilizers, self-sufficiency in improved agricultural implements, manufacturing of forestry and livestock products, promotion of three-dimensional agriculture, conservation of agricultural resources in the war zones, active implementation of agricultural extension and agricultural cooperation, and improvement of agricultural extension agencies. Special attention should be paid to rice, wheat, and cotton, which are related to people's livelihood, and silk, tea, tung oil, and pork, which are related to export trade, in order to improve the lives of farmers and increase agricultural products.</p>
<p>Forest Production</p>
<p>Is of great importance to industrial raw materials and farmland irrigation. During this time of war, the need for timber is particularly urgent, and the wood chemical industry should be established by the government. The southwestern provinces of our country are not lacking in large areas of natural forests. The surveyed and proven valuable timber is no less than tens of thousands of trees. All forests related to water conservancy and national soil conservation should be designated as state-owned forest areas by the government in accordance with the law, and bureaus should be established to manage them and harvest them in rotation. This will not only provide timber, but also employ labor. If the competent authorities can direct and supervise, so that logging and afforestation go hand in hand, so as to avoid the abuses of overlogging or abandonment, the timber will be inexhaustible. As for the existing barren mountains and wastelands in various provinces, those suitable for cultivating special economic forests should be planned by the central government and local governments should be urged to implement afforestation, in order to achieve the great effect of popularizing afforestation in the shortest possible time.

<p>— Mo Huanping</p>
<p>— The Bombing Situation in Chongqing on May Fourth —</p>
<p>[Chongqing News Agency of the Revolutionary Comrades Society] The citizens of Chongqing, no, the compatriots of the whole country, will never forget this day—the old and new hatreds of May Fourth!</p>
<p>This day was a clear early summer day, and the thick fog that permeated the skies of Chongqing had suddenly disappeared. The air raid siren had sounded once at half past ten in the morning. The bloody lesson of the day before, May Third—another day of old and new hatreds—the bloody lesson of being bombed and burned for two miles, had caused every citizen to flee desperately to air raid shelters or safe areas, helping the old and carrying the young. However, the × planes were intercepted by us and could not enter the city's airspace. An hour later, the alarm was lifted, and the citizens calmed their pounding hearts and went home to carry on with their lives.</p>
<p>A peaceful half-day, a tense half-day. —This was the fourth day of the May Fourth Revolution Propaganda Week, and a torchlight procession was planned for the evening.</p>
<p>At 4:50 in the afternoon, just as the sun was about to lean against the mountain peaks, the citizens thought it was a safe time, but suddenly the first air raid alarm went off. The will to live gripped the souls of the citizens, and they once again desperately ran to air raid shelters and safe areas. Children of a few years old were crushed under the feet of the crowded masses; eighty-year-old women were knocked down on the side of the road in the flowing stream of people. Upon entering the air raid shelter, seventy-year-old men gasped for breath, rapid breathing tormenting them as they lay down on the damp ground, as if dead; fashionable young ladies, pulling up the cheongsams whose clasps had been broken off in the crowd, wiped the sweat that poured from their foreheads like a spring.</p>
<p>Airplanes whirred and circled in the sky.</p>
<p>"One plane—two planes—six planes—nine planes—fourteen planes... Look, over there..."</p>
<p>"The emergency alarm hasn't been sounded yet, these are our planes!"</p>
<p>"Who cares whose planes they are? What are those people who are chattering away in the air raid shelter if not traitors?"</p>
<p>"Stop arguing! Stop arguing!" A third person interjected.</p>
<p>The planes circled in the sky for a while, and the sound gradually faded, until it could no longer be heard. The people hiding in the air raid shelter breathed a sigh of relief and walked out of the shelter entrance, raising their hands to look at the sky.</p>
<p>"The × × planes have been driven away by us."</p>
<p>"They've gone back."</p>
<p>"The alarm hasn't been lifted yet!"</p>
<p>"The emergency alarm hasn't been sounded, why wait for it to be lifted?"</p>
<p>So the citizens gradually set foot on the road home.</p>
<p>Woo—woo—woo—... Suddenly the emergency alarm sounded. The citizens immediately ran back to the air raid shelter.</p>
<p>"Those who deserve to be punished by heaven! How did the × × planes turn back again?"</p>
<p>The muscles on every face jumped with the torches of anger.</p>
<p>Boom! Rumble! Rumble rumble rumble! ...Bombs were dropped like a string of pearls. The waters of the Yangtze River beside Chongqing were shaken and rippled; the mountain peaks above Chongqing were shaken as if by an earthquake; the people in the air raid shelter all covered their ears with their hands, and their faces turned the color of dirt in shock; the terror of death enveloped the air raid shelter, and everyone held their breath. A wave of resentment stimulated the cells of the whole body, and red blood spurted out:</p>
<p>"Damn it! Even if we die, we'll go to the front line and fight those × × before we die!"</p>
<p>The dull, heavy sound of the planes gradually faded again, until it could no longer be heard. The citizens were still trembling in the air raid shelter, not daring to move. Restlessness, depression, and tense emotions were revealed in their eyes and muscles. After a good while, they crawled out.</p>
<p>"Ah!—"</p>
<p>They cried out in startled amazement.</p>
<p>Chongqing was burning with a sky full of beacons of fire!</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, × planes dropped bombs one by one, but now it is different. Dozens are dropped at the same time. It is estimated that twenty-seven × planes broke into the city's airspace to bomb on this day, each dropping ten or eight, or dozens of bombs, and most of them were incendiary bombs. The houses in Chongqing are all made of wood, and they are very dense, and the streets and alleys are narrow. Fanned by the fluttering early summer wind, how could it not immediately be a sky full of fireworks?</p>
<p>The prosperous commercial districts, cultural centers, and the location of foreign consulates, Xinglong Street, Du You Street, Cangping Street, Guanmiao Xiang, Chaijia Alley, Jishi Alley, Cangxian Bridge, Qixing Gang, etc., were all groaning in the flames; the "goods" of several large department stores were swallowed by the fire, and the Commercial Press, which had not yet recovered from the devastation of the "January 28th" Incident, was also destroyed; the British and French consulates suffered losses, and even the consulate of × people's ally—Germany—was turned into the embers of fire...</p>
<p>The tongues of fire, both wide and long, stretched into the clouds, causing the bright moon to lose its color; thousands upon thousands of citizens—men, women, old, and young—groaned, cried, and struggled in the tongues of fire...!</p>
<p>The citizens who luckily escaped the tongues of fire, after the air raid alarm was lifted, discovered that their houses and shops had been burned down. Immediately, wrinkles of grief and indignation swelled up on their faces, and they rushed towards the fire. I searched for my father, wife, children, and friends. The city's fire brigades, protection corps, rescue teams, and even the military police and the Youth Corps of the Three People's Principles were all mobilized to rescue the fire, refugees, and demolish fire lanes... Countless citizens, men, women, old, and young, some naked, some in long gowns, some fashionable, some in suits, sat on the streets, clenching their fists, watching the tongues of fire gradually spread out. Thus, the night of May Fourth passed!</p>
<p>On the morning of May Fifth, Chairman Chiang immediately ordered the allocation of one million yuan to urgently relieve the suffering compatriots. He also ordered various agencies to start registering refugees in several places; at the same time, all vehicles, large and small, from Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang down to ordinary civil servants and private individuals, as well as ships on the rivers, were centrally controlled by the government and assigned by Ministers He Yingqin and Yu Feipeng to carry out emergency free transportation of refugees to various safe locations.</p>
<p>As for the disaster areas, the city's protection, rescue, and military police personnel were mobilized to carry out the arduous task of digging up corpses. The corpses that were dug out had their clothes burned off and looked like fire-roasted pigs fresh out of the oven. Some had dark faces and could not be recognized; some had blurred flesh and bones and were no longer human-like; some had heads but no feet, and some had limbs separated. One by one, they were dragged out of the fire and placed on the streets, one by one, they were placed in thin wooden coffins costing four yuan each, and one by one, they were carried to the burial places in the suburbs. Who would not shed tears of mourning when they saw this? Who would not be aroused by the fire of anger!</p>
<p>The work of digging is still going on; the work of burying is also continuing. According to the statistics of the morning of the 7th, the coffin fees bought by the government at four yuan each have reached 36,000 yuan; the money spent by private individuals to buy coffins and bury the dead without coffins is not included. There are still several streets that have not been excavated. Let us try to imagine, how many kind civilians were killed by the × bandits' arson in Chongqing this time? As for the loss of property, it is even impossible to estimate!</p>
<p>We have another blood debt on our backs. This is a blood debt with new hatreds added to old hatreds. Every citizen of Chongqing, every Chinese compatriot, will absolutely not forget it, and will repay it with blood! (May 7th, Chongqing)</p>

<h3 id="e16">British Cabinet Discusses New Note to Soviet Union Yesterday, Accepts Soviet Mutual Assistance Proposal in Principle, Advocates Joint Declaration by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Lloyd George will present a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons on Friday on behalf of the opposition Liberal Party. The government will be questioned about the progress of British-Soviet negotiations. At the same time, Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Poland will also be discussed. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Undersecretary Butler will be the main speakers for the government, while Attlee and Greenwood will be the main speakers for the Labour Party. It is expected that the Prime Minister will rise to speak shortly after the start of the debate. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting on Tuesday evening, lasting two hours, to conduct a preliminary study of the Soviet Union's reply before the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] According to reliable sources, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee has passed a new note to the Soviet Union, accepting in principle the proposal for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. Earlier, the Soviet Union notified the British Foreign Office that it had decided to appoint Ambassador Maisky to replace Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to attend the League of Nations Council meeting, as an indirect warning to the British government not to delay the British-Soviet negotiations any longer. After receiving the Soviet Union's notification, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee immediately convened an exceptional meeting this afternoon. It is heard that all committee members are prepared to find ways to accept the Soviet proposal. Foreign Office experts have reportedly suggested a draft reply from the British side, the content of which seeks to accommodate the Soviet Union's views. The British government will convene a full Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and prepare to pass the new note, which will then be handed over to the Soviet Foreign Minister by British Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that if Chamberlain can show a posture of compromising with the Soviet Union, Potemkin will still be able to attend the League of Nations meeting. The French side has previously expressed its willingness to mediate. It is heard that the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax in Paris next Saturday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] Informal rumors were circulating in the House of Commons this evening that the British new note to the Soviet Union, while still refusing to form a military alliance, expressed three points: (1) Acknowledging in principle the signing of a mutual assistance agreement; (2) Approving the Soviet Union's proposal to provide guarantees to Poland, Turkey, and the Baltic states; (3) Expressing Britain's urgent desire to guarantee the Soviet Union's western border.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] Since the Soviet authorities announced the change of the initial proposal, changing from Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to Ambassador to the UK Maisky to attend the League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva (according to the Soviet plan), Soviet diplomacy has attracted more and more attention. In order to answer the Soviet Union's steps, the future talks in Geneva are extremely important. The French Foreign Minister Bonnet will begin to participate in the British and Soviet negotiations, and only from this fact, the British-Soviet negotiations have the hope of satisfactory conclusion. The League of Nations Council meeting itself is quite important. In addition to the original agenda, the League of Nations Committee may report on the Danzig issue. Political circles here firmly believe that the Soviet government's change of sending Maisky to attend the League of Nations meeting will absolutely not affect the British reply.

<h3 id="e17">France Plans to Discuss Military Alliance with Soviet Union to Link Britain and Soviet Union <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] It is learned that France is now planning to discuss a military alliance with the Soviet Union in order to act as an intermediary between Britain and the Soviet Union, to seek a compromise, without formally forming a tripartite alliance. Daladier and Bonnet are preparing to discuss this issue with Halifax. France's plan is to add provisions to the Franco-Soviet agreement that if one country is attacked or goes to war, the other country should provide assistance, but France's guarantee obligations to other countries have been lifted. Because Britain is France's close partner, this plan is enough to link Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] It is rumored in political circles here that France will actively operate in Geneva and other places this week, acting as a faithful middleman between the London and Moscow governments, jointly seeking the best way to resist aggression.

The British and French governments will continue to exchange views in order to effectively determine the content of this new counter-proposal.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The United Kingdom to Enact First Conscription: House of Commons Continues to Discuss Bill, Attorney General Proposes New Clause <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th dispatch] According to reports, the British government will, starting July 1st, conscript its first group of 40,000 to 50,000 men, even those as young as 21, and assign them to military training. Those conscripted must, within two weeks, pass a medical examination and report to the local government for enlistment. A second conscription will be carried out two months later.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] When the conscription bill was presented again in the House of Commons today for discussion, the Attorney General proposed a new clause, advocating authorizing the government to apply the conscription bill to British subjects residing outside the United Kingdom. In explaining this new clause, the Attorney General stated that, within the limitations of this new clause, British subjects residing overseas should register at the local British consulate and need not return to the country. Labor Party member Mr. Benn asked whether South African nationals residing in England would also be obligated to serve in the military. Questions were also raised as to whether men of age whose parents were British but who were born in France or Argentina should also be required to serve. The Attorney General explained that the conscription bill cannot be applied to British subjects originally residing in British territories, including self-governing dominions, colonies, and protectorates. Therefore, South African nationals can also be exempt from military service. Those residing in self-governing dominions and other parts of the British Empire have their own responsibility to defend that territory and are therefore not within the scope of the conscription bill. Conversely, British subjects residing in foreign countries, having enjoyed the benefits of British protection, should not be exempt from military service. The Attorney General stated that difficulties arising from the nationality of young people are unavoidable. At the same time, because the nationality laws of various countries have different bases, this issue is truly difficult to resolve completely and perfectly. Later, this new clause was finally attached to the conscription bill.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Crushing the Air Raid Plan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in order to prevent the bombing by [Japanese] aircraft, issued a letter on the 16th to the provincial and municipal governments and compatriots throughout the country. The full text was published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Chairman Chiang pointed out that the [Japanese] warlords' air raid plan consists of: (1) attempting to threaten the spirit of our entire nation's resistance with continuous bombing, hoping that we will surrender to [Japan]; (2) attempting to cut off the livelihood of our compatriots with fierce bombing, coercing our compatriots to reduce production in their displacement and affecting the future of the War of Resistance; (3) attempting to disrupt the tranquility of our society and disturb the order of our rear with concentrated bombing. Therefore, Chairman Chiang solemnly encouraged our compatriots throughout the country with three points, namely, first, to never forget this deep hatred, to further strengthen the determination to resist to the end, to crush the [Japanese] warlords' vicious plan, and to seek survival from death; second, to actively disperse urban residents, and also to earnestly strengthen organizations, go down to the countryside to develop rural areas, consolidate the front line of protracted resistance, and lay the foundation for future nation-building; third, to cooperate from top to bottom, to step up defense work, to ensure that we do not suffer major damage when the [Japanese] aircraft attack, and not to allow social order to be slightly affected. In this speech, Chairman Chiang also specifically pointed out our country's unprecedented victory in the current situation and the [Japanese]'s frenzied coming, and hoped that the soldiers and civilians throughout the country will further increase unity, vow to avenge the shame, be affectionate and sincere, and jointly repay the national hatred.</p>
<p>But looking at the extremely uncomplaining attitude of our Chongqing populace since [Japanese] aircraft frantically bombed Chongqing and other places, the increasingly high degree of anger of our national populace towards [the Japanese], and the unanimous condemnation of the [Japanese]'s [bestial] actions by domestic and foreign public opinion and the call for the entire nation to redouble its unity in supporting the central government's adherence to resistance, we can happily point out: all of our Chinese sons and daughters who are unwilling to be slaves have already used the fact of sincere support to express their compliance with Chairman Chiang's speech! However, as Chairman Chiang said, "[Japan] wants to destroy our nation, it must first cut off our people's lives, and its future brutal and cruel behavior will be even worse than today." Therefore, our compatriots throughout the country, in particular, must carefully read the full text of Chairman Chiang's speech this time, sincerely and earnestly comply. In particular, we, the overseas compatriots from all walks of life who have escaped the [Japanese]'s bombing and massacres and live abroad, should especially review Chairman Chiang's speech three times, and never forget the [Japanese] bandits' [cruel actions] against our ancestral land, homeland, and compatriots. Chairman Chiang said: "Those of our compatriots who are hit by their bullets may have their flesh and blood rot, or their homes turned into ruins. If anyone has a heart, how can they not feel compassion? And thinking of our compatriots in the occupied areas, the men are driven and tied up by [the Japanese], the women are forced and humiliated by the [Japanese] army, looking up at [Japanese] faces, bowing down to secretly weep, seeking to live without success, and unable to risk death!" All of our overseas compatriots, if they have a heart, how can they not feel heartache when they think of this? But as Chairman Chiang also showed: "The [Japanese] aircraft's behavior of indiscriminate bombing everywhere this time is certainly cruel and hateful, but its predicament is knowable." Therefore, our overseas compatriots, at this juncture, cannot just look back at the motherland and feel heartache like burning, but should redouble their alertness, solemnity, and unity, on the one hand, express their lofty respect and sincere support to Chairman Chiang, and express the greatest sympathy and sincere assistance to the compatriots under air raids and the compatriots in the occupied areas, on the other hand, we should support national unity in fact, support protracted resistance, promote spiritual mobilization, hold a national convention oath, mobilize overseas compatriots to return to the country to serve, [illegible] help the front line, expand the unified relief of refugees and the fundraising movement to help the soldiers, especially launch a large-scale international propaganda campaign, and do everything possible to increase the motherland's air defense capabilities.</p>

<p>Bandits are everywhere and thieves are on the rise. In the past two days, within a period of six hours, there were two robbery cases on land and sea. The first case occurred in the waters off Tai Shek Hau in Cheung Chau, where a sampan was looted by three thieves, and the owner's daughter was tragically strangled to death. Unexpectedly, only six hours after this case occurred, a "Pi An" in Ping Shan, a closely guarded area of the New Territories, was also looted by four armed thieves, and a young boy was shot and wounded. The rampant nature of the bandits can be said to be extreme.</p>

<p>The owner of the sampan No. 34040 is a woman named Cheng Dai-di (39 years old), who lives with her beloved daughter Luo Cai-kai (15 years old) on the sampan, specializing in the business of "ferrying" passengers across the sea. On the evening of the 16th of this month, they anchored in the waters off Tai Shek Hau in Cheung Chau. At nine o'clock that evening, a robber boat suddenly came surging in. Although they knew that the arrival was not well-intentioned, they raised their sails to escape. However, it was deep at night and there was no moonlight. Knowing that escape would be difficult, they glimpsed from a distance of several dozen feet that the robber boat carried three burly men, all wielding guns and looking fierce. After the thieves jumped over to the boat, they immediately threatened the Cheng mother and daughter with guns, tied them up with hemp ropes, and gagged their mouths with cloth. Then they calmly and arbitrarily searched and looted.</p>

<p>Luo Cai-kai, because her mouth was gagged by the thieves for a long time, was tragically suffocated to death. The three thieves searched and looted for about half an hour, and then fled with the stolen goods. After Cheng saw that the thieves were gone, she bravely broke free from the ropes, mourned over the body, and tried her best to steer the sampan back to the main port and reported the case to the police station. In this incident, stolen silver and goods included 15 yuan in cash, including three one-dollar Hong Kong banknotes, two yuan in dime coins, five yuan in five-cent coins, and five yuan in Hong Kong cents; a pair of knotted silk gold bracelets, worth 67 yuan; a pair of four-stranded gold vine bracelets, worth 35 yuan; a pair of three-stranded gold-set bracelets, worth 20 yuan; a set of [illegible] colored women's shirts and pants, worth 5 yuan; a blue satin women's shirt, worth 3 yuan; a black dotted muslin shirt, worth one [illegible], worth 7 yuan; a red crepe gauze undershirt, worth 1.5 yuan; a cotton quilt, worth 2 yuan; a pair of apricot jade earrings, worth 15 yuan; and a black cloth shirt, worth 2 yuan, totaling 171.5 yuan.

Just as she was about to get out of bed and ask who was there, a thief suddenly stood next to Feng's bed. Feng was pushed into the kitchen, tied up with ropes. Before long, three more thieves entered, with one thief watching Feng. Two thieves went into the room to do their work, and one thief was "keeping watch" at the door. Feng's companion, Au Kwai-ho, knew that she was being robbed, so she fled in a panic. However, she was seen by the thief, who chased after her and hit her with the butt of a gun. Au was so frightened at this time that she fell to the ground, injuring her face and hands. Seeing that she was injured, the thief did not pursue further. Au fled to the entrance of Shek Po Village, and her soul finally settled down.</p>

<p>However, at this critical moment in the nation's [illegible], it is not appropriate to spend lavishly on personal birthdays. Therefore, the entire Hong Kong drama circle jointly performed "Huanghuagang" at the Po Hing Theatre on the 20th and 21st of this month. All the proceeds will be handed over to the Relief Federation to comfort the fallen soldiers, and the work will replace the birthday gift, celebrating the birthday in national salvation, which is of great significance.

<h3 id="e40">Various Film Works for Charity Screening on Birthday <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In addition, Mr. Zhang Weixian, the owner of Wah Shing Company, donated Mr. Ouyang's works "Mulan Joins the Army" and "The Peach Blossom Fan," Mr. Feng Qiliang, the owner of Wah Wai Company, donated Mr. Ouyang's work "Xiaolingyu," and Central Theatre, Cathay Theatre, Nathan Theatre, and other theatres donated theatres to publicly screen his works on the day of Ge Yang Yu Qing's birthday, and all the proceeds will be handed over to the Relief Federation to help refugees. This is an unprecedented grand occasion. According to Li Hua, secretary of the "Huanghuagang" charity performance committee, Mr. Ouyang said that he would not accept any birthday gifts. If relatives and friends need to express something, please purchase "Huanghuagang" tickets to replace the [illegible] gift. At that time, Mr. Ouyang will [illegible] to the theatre stage to express his gratitude. If there are still relatives and friends sending gifts, whether it is cash or souvenirs, all birthday gifts will be transferred to the Hong Kong Relief Federation for [illegible] the families of fallen soldiers and for the relief of refugees, and please ask the Relief Federation to publish in the newspaper to inform the gift-givers.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Our Foreign Transport Channel: Hong Kong-Vietnam Freight Traffic is Unprecedented, More Than 30 Ships are Traveling Between the Two Places, Average of One Ship Carrying Increase Every Day <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since the fall of [Guang]zhou, the cessation of the Yuehan [Rail]way, and then the [Japanese] invasion of Hainan Island and the emergency in Beihai, the Tonggui Highway has been completely destroyed. Most of our country's import and export goods have taken the route of Haiphong in Vietnam. As a result, Hong Kong-Vietnam freight traffic has become increasingly congested. According to what reporters learned from various shipping companies yesterday, the freight traffic between Hong Kong and Haiphong can be said to have reached its peak and can be said to be unprecedented in history.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Hong Kong-Vietnam Ships Reaching More Than 30 Vessels <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that there are currently more than 30 ships sailing between Hong Kong and Haiphong. In addition to Swire, CNCO, and French Post, there are also Jebsen and other companies. On average, there is almost one ship entering and leaving every day, and most of them are fully loaded. In Hong Kong, those who want to send goods to Haiphong must wait for a considerable period of time, or they must make a reservation in advance. Some merchants have to rent storage space because there is no rail transport. At the same time, the freight rate per picul has also increased from a few cents to more than one yuan. Most of the goods from Hong Kong to Haiphong are foreign goods, most of which are transshipped to the southwest provinces. The goods shipped from Vietnam to Hong Kong are mostly local products, such as tung oil, tin, medicinal herbs, and other [illegible] products.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Haiphong Warehouses Impassable <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>According to an air express report received by a shipping company yesterday, due to the congestion of freight traffic, there are indeed no empty warehouses in Haiphong. Many goods are stored in the open air near the customs. The congestion is even more severe than in Hong Kong in the past year. This is because there are not many warehouses in Haiphong, and the storage capacity is far less than that of Hong Kong. Passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Vietnam are also breaking the records of recent years. It has been found that most of the passports issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs [illegible] Certificate Office in Hong Kong in recent months are for those who travel from Vietnam to Yunnan. It can be seen that many of the travelers to Vietnam are using a false route to enter the mainland. According to speculation in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong-Vietnam freight traffic will be booming for a certain period of time, and it is possible that several more ships will be added in the near future.</p>

This trip is a private matter." After speaking, he hurriedly left the airport and boarded the "Cuxhaven". The ship left Hong Kong at 4:00 PM yesterday, heading to Shanghai, Japan, and other places. As for the reason for the ship's delayed departure, it was due to receiving an order from the German government to wait for Mr. Xuan's boarding.</p>

However, the shirt worn by the corpse had the words "Feilie" and other words, leading to suspicion that the deceased was a crew member who accidentally fell into the sea and drowned.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Hong Kong Fishermen's Association's Proposal to Promote Fisheries Submitted to the Production Conference for Reference; Minister of Education Chen Lifu Replies to the Fishermen's Association <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association recently noted that since the incident in South China, many coastal fishermen have been slaughtered by the enemy and suffered enormous property losses, and tens of thousands have been unemployed and destitute. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, the association submitted a proposal to the National Production Conference, requesting adoption. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from the Ministry of Education approving the inclusion of the proposal in the conference for reference. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Relief Plan</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association believes that the convening of the National Production Conference this time at the initiative of the Fisheries Association is of great significance. In the issue of increasing national production, fishery production is quite important. Therefore, it has formulated three relief proposals: (1) Request to include strengthening the organization of fishery production and handling fishery relief; (2) Request to include a fishery item in the Anti-Japanese War and National Reconstruction Plan and central government expenditures to promote national aquaculture; (3) Request the central government to cherish specialized fishery technical personnel and promote fisheries education for fishermen. The association submitted these proposals to Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Preparatory Committee of the Production Conference, requesting them to be submitted for discussion at the Production Conference.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education's Reply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association received a reply from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, stating that the three proposals have been submitted to the Production Conference for reference. The original telegram stated: "On behalf of the telegram, the details regarding various fisheries matters have been presented, and it is requested that they be submitted to the Production Conference for discussion. Having learned from the telegram on your behalf, it has been copied and sent to the National Production Conference for reference. Please be informed accordingly." This is the reply from Minister of Education Chen Lifu.</p>

<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>"Mahjong" in Hong Kong is considered a "noble" pastime, one of the indoor games. So every household, and even small merchants on the streets, set up tables and play their four-person game. The clatter of mahjong tiles is endless.</p>
<p>In middle and upper-class families, almost nine out of ten play mahjong as part of their daily routine. When friends visit, they naturally gather four people for "entertainment." Even when they are short one player, they rope in friends and relatives to join the game for amusement.</p>
<p>The working class and shop employees, because they are in Hong Kong, naturally see this "entertainment" no differently than the middle and upper classes. However, most of them do not have families in Hong Kong. Opening tables privately is hindered by the interference of bosses and colleagues. Going to a club requires at least five or seven dollars, which they cannot afford to frequent. In such a social environment, "mahjong parlors" where all kinds of people can sit down have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, planned by clever "operators." From then on, the common people no longer worry about having nowhere to "entertain" themselves. According to an investigation by insiders, there are about fifty or sixty of these mahjong parlors in Hong Kong and Kowloon.</p>
<p>The "Aviation" in Central's Gage Street and "Chicken Kee" on Hoi Mei Nan Street are well-known mahjong parlors. The former seems to be the earliest established and has the most tables (two shops connected, with thirty to forty tables). The working class in the Central area, during their leisure time, especially on payday, all go to "Aviation" without fail. The latter is a quite large one by the sea, with branches in two locations.</p>
<p>The locations for opening mahjong parlors are mostly in areas where lower and middle-class commoners gather. Gage Street and Hollywood Road near Water Street in Central, Chun Yeung Street and Cross Street in Wanchai, and Western District's Sai Ying Pun and First Street, as well as Nam Street in Tai Kok Tsui, Wu Song Street, Battery Street, Shanghai Street, and the section of Canton Road near Yau Ma Tei, can all be said to be areas where mahjong parlors abound. Day or night, they are always crowded with customers. If we try to take a look inside, we will see several people standing and waiting for a "reserve" seat, and we never see an empty one. The number of people who "entertain" themselves will leave you speechless.</p>
<p>Their business method is "taking a cut." For games with a base of one dollar per point, the owner takes two cents from each player. For every four points after that, the owner takes one cent from each player. For games with a base of two or three dollars per point, it follows the same principle. Players who sit down must play with "face value," meaning that they must put as much money as possible on the table. It is said that at least six copper coins are required to play. After one round, they must "push the seat to the next player," and the people on the waiting list immediately take their seats. This method is used by the owners, first, to prevent "empty guns," and second, to eliminate disputes between players.</p>
<p>Because these mahjong parlors are open to all kinds of people, the quality of the players is mixed. A month ago, because robbery cases occurred frequently in Kowloon, the police authorities, in order to actively prevent and clear out bandits, arrested many suspicious bandits in these mahjong parlors during a certain period. In addition, professional gamblers who live by cheating mix in, and fights and disputes are naturally unavoidable. Therefore, the owners hire one or two strongmen in the parlors to "watch the heads" (monitor), in order to curb and prevent such events from happening. If the cheaters are still not polite and continue to patronize the parlor after being warned by the strongmen, they will naturally be beaten and driven out.</p>
<p>Mahjong parlors like "Aviation" and "Chicken Kee," which are larger in scale, are estimated to have a daily income of six or seventy dollars in net profit after deducting expenses, and smaller ones have ten or twenty dollars.</p>
<p>"Sharing the wealth," it is said that mahjong parlors, like other "opium dens" and "drug dens," cannot be an exception.</p>

<p>Over a hundred refugees in the northern New Territories, who were ordered to return to their hometowns or were unwilling to leave last Sunday, were allowed to be aided by the Red Cross. According to recent information from our reporter, there are still over two hundred people who cannot return to their hometowns, and the Red Swastika Society cannot accommodate them. They are wandering around various villages in the New Territories and are still awaiting help. These refugees have sent representatives to the Tung Wah Hospital to request assistance. It is found that they are still living outdoors and are suffering from hunger, which is very pitiful. In the past two days, a certain wealthy merchant has sent people to deliver a batch of lunch and white porridge for relief. It is hoped that kind and charitable people from all sides will provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Smugglers Greedy and Treacherous! Secretly Transporting Tung Oil to Hong Kong. Two Transport Ships Intercepted by Our Customs Overseas, Containing Three Thousand Cans of Tung Oil Worth Over Thirty Thousand Dollars <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil is one of China's special products and has a wide range of uses. It can be used for manufacturing military supplies. In recent years, countries have been expanding their military equipment and purchasing it in large quantities from China. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the National Government has ordered a nationwide ban on exports, with the government controlling overseas sales and designating sales to the United States in exchange for foreign exchange to purchase military supplies. However, some smugglers, greedy and treacherous, take advantage of the government's ban on exports to smuggle and profit from it. The situation is especially serious in Guangdong. For more than a year, they have been secretly transporting oil to Hong Kong to sell to the enemy or foreign merchants in large quantities. Our authorities have been paying close attention to this. According to our reporter, smuggling has been extremely active in the coastal areas from Chaozhou and Shantou to Hong Kong recently. They use small boats to smuggle tung oil to Hong Kong at night. Yesterday, another large batch was smuggled for export using civilian ships, but after leaving the harbor, they were discovered and intercepted by a customs patrol boat. A total of two ships were seized, containing three thousand cans of tung oil worth over 30,000 yuan in national currency. It is learned that the batch of tung oil was organized by unscrupulous merchants in Shantou on a large scale, using civilian ships to transport it to the waters outside the port of Haimen, and then transferring it to large merchant ships heading to Hong Kong for transport to this port. In addition, bandits there are also secretly transporting tungsten ore, hemp, and other items for export.</p>

They immediately broke through two layers of barbed wire, and the enemy soldiers stubbornly resisted in strong fortifications. The soldiers engaged in close combat. The soldiers were concerned about penetrating too deeply. The enemy in Zengcheng fired artillery at the Luojin positions. Hit by several bullets, they suffered more than a dozen casualties. The soldiers were engaged in fierce fighting until 3:00 a.m. on the 15th and soldiers withdrew to the original positions as the sky was about to dawn.

Commander Zhang Yan of the Special Garrison Area Orders Garrison Troops to Strictly Prevent and Control <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Express News from Nanlu) The number of enemy ships off the coast of Southern Guangdong has increased slightly. Statistics show that there are now about thirteen or fourteen ships, cruising in the areas of Fangcheng, Qinzhou, Beihai, and the Leizhou Peninsula, or taking the opportunity to survey waterways. At 7:30 a.m. on the 10th of this month, an enemy ship with double smokestacks suddenly sailed to Xuwenzhisan Tanggang and spied and peeped. Our garrison troops knew that the enemy must have a plan, and redoubled their attention. Before long, the enemy ship released a speedboat, carrying fifty to sixty enemy soldiers, and headed straight for the shore. The soldiers feared that they would take the opportunity to land, so they prepared to intercept them. However, the enemy boat did not dare to enter the perimeter of our warning line, and only carried out waterway surveys nearby. It was not until 9:00 a.m. that they scurried back to the ship. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 13th, an enemy cruiser also scoured the sea near Anpu Port, which belongs to Lianjiang County, and sent two enemy boats, carrying seventy to eighty enemy soldiers, to survey the waterways along the coast. Zhang Yan, deputy commander of the Special Garrison Area, because the number of enemy ships in Nanlu has increased again, and they frequently conduct secret surveys of our coastal waterways, has ordered his subordinates to strictly prevent and control.</p>

<p>[Shantou Newsletter] On the fifteenth, there was dense fog overseas. In the afternoon, the weather changed suddenly, and waves filled the sky. It is not known whether the enemy aircraft carrier anchored in Nanao was transferred to another location. No air raid alert was heard here all day long. Only two enemy transport aircraft routinely traveled back and forth between Xiamen and Guangdong via Chaozhou. As for the Mazu Estuary in the north and south ports, there are currently one patrol ship, two destroyers, and three armed fishing boats anchored there. On the 14th, three enemy aircraft attacked Chaoyang. Twice, they flew low and strafed passengers at the Longdu Qianxi Wharf, killing four men and one woman, and injuring more than 20 people. They also dropped white incendiary powder, burning down two Xin Ning Flying electric boats, fortunately without injuring anyone. Two ferries in Fengchuan Shangdian were also strafed on the way, killing and injuring more than a dozen people. The Shantou People's Police Headquarters, in view of the increasing tension in Chaozhou and Shantou, in order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of various teams and increase self-defense capabilities, convened various teams at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th to practice street fighting. When the hypothetical enemy approached the streets, the teams bravely counterattacked. After a period of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and fled. The results of the exercise were very good. Mayor Wu has issued orders to send condolences and encourage them.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Recent Events in Shaoguan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Newsletter) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun believes that wartime political measures are extremely important, and that for all aspects of people's livelihood, finance, construction, education, and general administration, first, we must seek to eliminate abuses, and second, we must seek to promote benefits, so as to adapt to military needs. Recently, groups from all walks of life have moved to Shaoguan one after another, and the atmosphere of national salvation has suddenly become vigorous. The specific circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Various Groups Move to Shaoguan Since Shaoguan formed a new Guangdong capital, groups from all walks of life have moved to Shaoguan to handle affairs. Currently, the Guangdong Provincial General Labor Union has moved to Shaoguan to set up. In addition, the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Provincial Journalists Association are also preparing to move north. The Provincial Party Headquarters has formulated a plan for the issue of various groups moving to Shaoguan, and has notified groups scattered in various places to move to Shaoguan before the end of June, otherwise their activities will not be effective.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Mobilization Committee The Guangdong Provincial Mobilization Committee was originally chaired by Yu Hanmou and vice-chaired by Li Hanhun. Later, Yu resigned after having repeatedly asked to be released from the burden of administrative responsibility, as he was too busy with military affairs. The Central Government then sent Li Hanhun to take over as chairman. The committee is currently completing the handover, and the reorganization will be completed during the day. The director of the committee, Lu Zongqi, is internally designated to take on responsibilities. After Director Li took office, he immediately implemented the National Spiritual Mobilization Covenant promulgated by the Central Government, and instructed all agencies and groups to hold monthly meetings to eliminate all bad habits of the people and take on the important mission of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Class Graduates The xth War Zone has specially recruited aspiring young people to establish a guerrilla training class to train guerrilla cadres and talents, implement various guerrilla tactics training, and has now completed training. In mid-month, they will be assigned to serve in various war zones and occupied areas, focusing on organizing the masses, training the masses, and participating in the anti-Japanese war.</p>

<p>[Wuzhou Express] Rice prices in Wuzhou have risen in recent days. Rongxu Xishan has risen to 24 yuan per municipal dan in Guizhou currency. The poor people are crying out in pain. The Guizhou Provincial authorities specially ordered the Guangxi Grain Administration to find ways to regulate food, to make up for shortages with surpluses. Currently, the Bureau has been ordered to requisition civilian ships to Liuzhou to collect rice and distribute it to food-deficient areas to stabilize people's food. Both east and west regions have each sent a group to investigate and guide, emphasizing both sides.</p>

<p>(Zhongshan Express) Enemy efforts to advance across the river are repeatedly thwarted, accomplishing nothing despite great effort. Attempting to contain our forces, they constantly send enemy ships and motorboats to harass our coasts and incite Chinese traitors to infiltrate the mainland of Zhongshan to spread rumors, in order to cover up their defeats in the Xinhui area. Their limited skills are evident. Recently, seeing that the defenses of various districts in Zhongshan are solid, they are trying to disrupt local security. Yesterday, around 9 a.m. on the 16th, three enemy shallow-draft vessels suddenly sailed from Rongqi to the Yinggezui River surface at the border of Zhongshan and Shunde, wandering back and forth with suspicious movements. Our defending teams, fearing that the enemy intended to land, immediately took strict precautions and telegraphed the headquarters of the First District Guerrilla Detachment. At almost 10 a.m., the enemy ships fired shells at Xiaolan from afar, firing seven consecutive rounds, the sound of which reverberated far and wide. Three shells immediately hit Xiaolan City. The citizens, having just heard the sound of artillery fire, immediately saw houses collapsing and people being injured, not knowing where the shells came from, and fled in panic, causing disorder. After investigation, one shell landed inside Liu Kuanda's building on Huaguang Temple Street, piercing the roof and walls, with the diameter of the hole exceeding five feet. One shell landed in a large house in Tongde Lane, collapsing three houses on either side, killing one old man and injuring three passersby with shrapnel. One shell landed in the Yangzhong Street Taibai Building of Tiyun Yixue, killing two and injuring three. The remaining four shells landed in the wilderness. Yuan, the commander of the Special Action Column, immediately led his troops to maintain order and ordered the stationed rescue teams to mobilize. It was not until 4 p.m. that order was restored in the city. However, the villagers automatically evacuated to other places. According to intelligence, the enemy ships are still loitering in Yinggezui. Our coastal teams have doubled their efforts and are strictly guarding the area.</p>

<p>(Qujiang Communication) The Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, considering that the relief cause urgently requires a large number of talents, has specially accepted more than 100 graduates from the former Fourth Route Army Headquarters Rescue Cadre Training Class, more than 100 members from the Xijiang Provisional Political Brigade, more than 10 members from the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps, and more than 20 members from the Hong Kong Student Relief Association Returning to the Country Service Corps, and organized them into a relief corps, with Chen Ruye concurrently serving as the corps commander, directly under the command and dispatch of the association. Since the outbreak of the war, war zone refugees have been displaced and urgently need relief. Child refugees are especially in need of rescue. The association has already started relief efforts separately. Currently, the New Life Movement Women's Work Team has also organized a child refugee rescue team, which set off to rescue people in Taishan, Xinhui, and the Dongjiang area at the beginning of this month. At the same time, the Provincial Party Department's wartime work team has also organized a rescue team to set off for work in the war zone.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Students Who Left Training Camp are Allowed to Return to School <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>(Qujiang Communication) The Department of Education, considering that some students in centralized training have escaped and left the team, should have been expelled from school in accordance with Article 1 of the Measures for Punishing Students Who Evade Training and Escape. However, after investigation, a considerable number of students have been punished with expulsion, and many of them have been lost in the chaos and have not been able to return to the team. If they were to lose their schooling as a result, it would be regrettable. Therefore, it was discussed with the General Headquarters of the Centralized Training of Students in this province, and a letter was replied approving leniency. Students who have left the training camp are allowed to return to their original schools, but considering that these students have been in training for quite a long time, which is different from the situation of students evacuated in other groups, the original schools should require them to repeat a grade and record a demerit once, and they will be summoned for supplementary training in the next session. A special order has been issued to the county and city governments to instruct the schools to comply with the order.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Central Film Studio Completes New Film "The Siege of the Lone City"; Premieres Simultaneously in Three Theaters in Chongqing <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Communication) Since the Central Film Studio moved to Chongqing, due to the limitations of material conditions, several films that were originally planned to be made could not be started. However, in terms of newsreels, "The Shanghai Front," "The Eastern Battlefield," "The Active Western Front," and "The Ninth Month of the War of Resistance" have been completed one after another. Problems such as electricity, scenery, and indoor venues, which were previously considered difficult, were not solved until the summer of last year, and formal film shooting work began at that time.</p>
<p>The first planned production of the Central Film Studio was the anti-Japanese war newsreel "The Siege of the Lone City." Since the film began production last year, it has been suspended due to material problems. It was not until recently that the entire production was completed. The film tells the heroic story of General Yao Ziqing's defense of Baoshan City. The actors, such as Bai Sen, Bai Yun, and Bao Shi, have all received university education. Although they are not old and experienced big stars, their acting experience on the screen may not be very proficient, but their familiarity and efforts have made the film exceptionally colorful.</p>
<p>Another film, "Prelude to Victory," was completed at the same time as "The Siege of the Lone City." This film is a real record of anti-Japanese war news, so it is included in the fifth volume of "Anti-Japanese War News Records." In this film, there are real scenes of the "Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement" conference, Generalissimo Chiang's exhortations to women, Ms. Soong Mei-ling's speech for women's contributions, as well as the heroic posture of our Northwest cavalry attacking and the real record of the Japanese fleeing in disarray. The whole film is full of shots that make people feel exceptionally excited.</p>
<p>Now, these two completed anti-Japanese war films have begun premiering simultaneously in the "Xinchuan," "Cathay," and "Only" three theaters in Chongqing since May 5.</p>
<h3 id="e73">How Little Babies Act; Half a Minute is More Than Enough <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The telecommunications meeting on the 25th of last month recorded that the new labor law in California, USA, restricts the work of young children in filming to no more than half a minute (30 seconds) per day. Readers may ask, "How can you act in half a minute?" Yes, please see the following facts:</p>
<p>The first to film in accordance with the new labor law was a baby who was only sixteen days old. He performed in the telephone film "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell" (starring Loretta Young and Don Ameche). In the plot, there is a section where Loretta Young should be holding a newborn baby. Before the filming started, a doll was used to rehearse. When the rehearsal was pure, the filming started. When everything was ready, the nanny brought the baby, and his mother and a representative of the state health department followed. In a dressing room with white satin walls, the doctor dropped a small drop of disinfectant oil in the baby's eyes to avoid the strong light and sterilization of the arc lamp. Then filming began. Loretta Young gently held the baby, Don Ameche bent down to look at him, and then turned around. The shot was over. The time spent was only ten seconds. The cautious director, seeing that there were still twenty seconds left, ordered a retake. But when it came to the thirtieth second, the government representative, who had been standing next to him watching the watch, ran over and said, "It's time!" So the baby completed his day's work.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Lost Lamb; Ge Zaozhi Quits Movies; Rumored to go to the Philippines to Study Music <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Ge Zaozhi, a child star now in Hong Kong, is still as lively and lovely as he was in the film "Lost Lamb." However, although he is still a child, he understands everything about adults thoroughly. People who see him often feel that he now has the habits of adults. You may doubt how his innocent posture in Shanghai disappeared so quickly. Was it the environment in Hong Kong that made him like this, or was it his own psychological perversion?</p>
<p>He has been acting very little lately and is still idle all day. It is said that he will go to the Philippines before June at the latest, because he has an uncle who works in customs there, and several brothers also work in the same place. One of his brothers is a senior staff member of a radio company. The purpose of his going there is to study radio.</p>
<p>Ge Zaozhi's family financial situation is not very good, and his current living situation is not ideal. Now no one asks him to act anymore. Originally, child stars have never been valued in Hong Kong, so he must leave the film industry to find a way out in another society.</p>

<p>Pickering smiled, as if his bet with Higgins had been won. "I say again--if you can make her into a duchess, you are indeed the greatest teacher in the world."</p>
<p>Week after week went by, one side patiently teaching, the other patiently learning. Eliza repeated meaningless vowels over and over again.</p>
<p>"No, Eliza, wrong, read it again." Higgins would sometimes take off his glasses worriedly, waving his finger to correct her pronunciation. "Let's try again, ah--ah! --like the A sound in the word Father."</p>
<p>Eliza studied very attentively, not afraid of difficulties at all, which also moved Higgins very much.</p>
<p>His teaching method was very simple, he only taught her to pretend that she didn't know anything, completely like learning to speak from the beginning. He also taught her how to enter a room, how to exit a room, how to stand, how to sit, how to walk, and finally he always returned to the question of her pronunciation, asking her to follow his speaking tones and repeat them again and again until she spoke clearly.</p>
<p>Months later, Higgins said to General Pickering, "The day of success has arrived, we can take her out to try." He thought for a while and said with a smile, "I have it, go see my mother."</p>
<p>Professor Henry Higgins was a very respected person in society, but his mother still treated him like a child when she saw him. When he walked into her parlor today, his mother said, "I have many guests today, you shouldn't come, you don't understand etiquette."</p>
<p>Mother and son talked, and he briefly said something about Eliza. He finally said, "I asked her to come here today, you don't have to worry, she won't make a fool of herself, just talk about the weather and health and other kinds of polite words."</p>
<p>At this time, guests arrived one after another, and Higgins was a little worried. His heart was also beating faster, because all those who arrived were aristocratic figures. General Pickering also arrived later. After a short while, the maid finally reported that Miss Doolittle had arrived.</p>
<p>Eliza appeared at the door, wearing beautiful clothes, with a smile on her lips. She looked around the room and walked towards Mrs. Higgins, saying in a lovely, clear, and enthusiastic voice, "Mrs. Higgins, may you be well. Professor Higgins said I could come."</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right," his mother said cordially, "You are very welcome to come," as if she and Eliza were very close old friends, introducing her to the other guests one by one. When she walked to Higgins standing by the fireplace, she said to Eliza, "You already know my son--"</p>

<h3 id="e77">Completion of the Championship Sweep: South China Wins the Asahi Cup Again; Navy, Though Resisting Tenaciously, Ultimately Loses 1-4 <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Spring departs, good times don't last; that "restore prosperity" football season is now fading with the ninety days of spring. Times of elegance and romance disperse; the most distressing thing is...</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the championship battle for the Asahi Cup was performed at the Garrison Hill venue. This was the finale of the six major championships, a matter of great importance, not to be taken lightly. Because this coveted prize, whose fate was yet undecided, in the "triangular" pursuit, who would ultimately be victorious, was determined here.</p>
<p>After all, South China was fortunate, forging a "good match," and giving their "rival in love," the foreign sailors, a painful blow, teaching them to return to their ships and sail out of the "river of love."</p>
<p>South China, in this instance, achieved two things at once. Not only did they regain the "throne," but they also completed the South China team's creation of a championship sweep. Such a feat can be described as glorifying the ancestors and benefiting future generations.</p>
<p>However, the Navy was not "powerless to protect the flower," only lacking in the fortune of fate. In the competition, they struggled valiantly, extraordinarily tenacious. They once took the lead with a score of 1-0, even winning a penalty kick against South China and several opportunities to score on open shots. Alas, their feet had no eyes, kicking blindly and missing. The "Johns" in the audience were disheartened by the sight.</p>
<p>The lineups of both sides were slightly different from the last time. On the South China side, they temporarily invited the universally admired Li Huitang to play center forward, thereby strengthening the attacking power of the front line. His name was not originally listed in the "battle order," but Ye Beihua and Chen Dehui both had foot pain, leading to lamentations of a lack of talent in the front line. Thus, the "strategist" Mo Qing became anxious. Only yesterday morning did he obtain Huitang's consent, willing to take the field for a good cause. In fact, Huitang shared the same concern as us regarding whether the South China team could complete the championship sweep. Moreover, he was a contributing member in winning the International Cup and the Li Hua Cup. Although he wanted to stay out of the Asahi Cup contest, he was compelled to take the field as a pivotal figure, due to the injuries of those who could not participate and Mo Qing's earnest invitation, in order to fully complete the final act, lest the effort fall short after nearly succeeding. His loyalty to his mother club is truly rare. If he hadn't been in the lineup yesterday, it would have been quite questionable whether they could have won. This is because the foreign sailors performed very well in this match. Even with Huitang in the lineup, it was not easy to attack and win. If he were absent, it would be difficult to guarantee that they would not be defeated by the foreign sailors. Therefore, yesterday's success was undoubtedly due to Huitang. The saying "with the right person, the championship thrives" is also South China's good fortune.</p>
<p>On the Navy side, they replaced two new players in the front line; the rest were the same as last time. Although there were replacements, their combat power was not weakened but rather enhanced. Their defense was particularly effective. Center back Cooper marked Huitang closely, never leaving his side, making it difficult for Huitang to find opportunities. Therefore, before Handy was penalized for the incident, they were still playing evenly matched against South China, and the situation was very tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately, Handy lacked self-control and struck Yang Shuiyi, violating the "heavenly law," sacrificing himself and, as a result, causing his team to collapse and become irredeemable due to fighting with fewer players. They conceded two more goals, leading to South China's resounding victory. However, while we certainly wanted South China to win, there was no need to feign pity for the Navy with a "hungry fox mourning the mouse" attitude. However, many exciting and tense moments of the battle were ruined by Handy's lack of discretion, which spoiled the whole thing. It was truly a blemish on perfection. Therefore, I believe Handy is the villain of the Navy side and a spoilsport for the spectators.</p>
<p>The South China players were skilled at playing on wet ground. After the light rain, the field was as soft as cotton. South China had the advantage of both favorable weather and terrain. During the match, the red sun was in the sky, and they chose to position themselves with their backs to the sun, so their momentum was irresistible. Victory was expected.</p>
<p>After the silver whistle blew, Morris was the first to sound the battle drum, marching straight forward, hoping to take the Yellow Dragon's lair in one fell swoop. Qingcai attacked from the side, and the Navy's attack was slightly blunted. From then on, there was close-quarters combat. Guangsen swore an oath at the border, directly attacking the Navy's hinterland, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Soon after, Horton's cross was blocked. South China counterattacked with the ball. Guangsen immediately crossed, and the ball landed in a good spot. "Buddha" used his "Buddha's head" to head the ball, but it was a wasted effort.</p>
<p>After a prolonged battle, the Navy advanced through the middle. Tiansheng was unable to defend, allowing Knox to go straight into the interior, raise his foot, and shoot. The ball went in with a sound, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>After the restart at the center line, South China counterattacked. Huitang received Shuiyi's cross and passed it to "Buddha" for a diagonal shot, but it missed. Huitang was unwilling to lose out and seized the opportunity to rise up. Before long, Huitang passed the ball through the middle to Jingxiang, and as desired, he scored with one shot, tying the game. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, the Navy's center forward attacked, and Tiansheng's attack was judged as a foul by the referee, resulting in a penalty kick. At this time, the fans were all terrified. Cooper stepped forward to take the kick, and Rongcai embraced the moon, catching the ball in a perilous situation. The fans applauded thunderously.</p>
<p>After a long melee, Guangsen moved and crossed in time. Sitang received the ball and shot immediately, straight into the net, scoring a second goal. The victory was secured from this point. In the first half, South China took a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Before the players had time to catch their breath, they went back on the road. Huitang led the army forward, but they were blocked. After a while, Guangsen sent supplies forward. Huitang shot high and retreated. The Navy advanced from the border, breaking through many defenses. Knox and Dulan passed the ball beautifully, but fortunately, Troban's shot missed.</p>
<p>Before long, Morris went on a solo run. The crisis was urgent. If it weren't for Guowei's surprise attack, a goal would have been unavoidable.</p>
<p>The Navy repeatedly looked for a way to score within the South China formation, hoping to wipe out their shame. Soon after, Knox Dulan fired a shot from the front line, powerful and fast. Fortunately, Rongcai was quick-handed and quick-eyed, catching the ball and averting the dangerous situation.</p>
<p>South China seized the opportunity to attack. During a close-quarters melee, Handy inappropriately struck Shuiyi and was seen by the referee, who ejected him. South China also gained the advantage of a penalty kick. Huitang took the shot and scored, making it 3-1. After about a minute of further play, Buddha also scored, sealing the deal. As a result, South China won 4-1. Thus, this 70-minute Asahi Cup battle came to a close.</p>
<p>After the game, the award was presented by Mrs. Jia Naixi, wife of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army stationed in China. At this time, fans gathered around to watch.

<h3 id="e78">Xu Brothers in Battle and Harmony with Philippine Players; Four Scenes of Double and Single Matches Today <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>…Yesterday afternoon, after the rain cleared and the sun shone brightly, the originally scheduled Philippine-Hong Kong tennis exhibition match was able to take place on time. The general fans were overjoyed.</p>
<p>…The Philippine First Cup player, Sanchez, is still well and his demeanor remains the same. Yesterday, he and the rising star of the Philippines, Abong, passed through this place and came to the venue together. Abong is only seventeen years old and no more than five feet tall, the youngest player to ever attend the Cup competition. His skin is dark brown, with the flavor of his Philippine homeland. He is as light as a swallow, lively, agile, and truly promising.</p>
<p>…The Xu brothers first played a doubles match against the Philippine players. Big Xu served first, and he and his younger brother coordinated well, winning the first game. In the second game, Sanchez served, powerfully and with good angles, scoring four "aces" in a row, tying the game at 1-1. After that, Sanchez repeatedly used his serve to score, leaving the two Xus at a loss, taking a 5-3 lead. At this time, Abong, with victory in sight, continuously performed his special skills. His net play was fast and steady, and the balls he hit were mostly near the net, leaving the Xu brothers helpless, and winning the first set 6-3.</p>
<p>…In the second set, the Xu brothers realized that the Philippine players were not very confident with overheads, so they sent out high balls whenever possible, attacking their weakness. They took a 2-0 lead, then a 3-1 lead. They only faltered when Sanchez served, and were caught up to 2-3, then tied at 3-3. At this point, the Xu brothers, fearing further losses, braced themselves and paid full attention, displaying their special skills, and finally reached a 5-3 lead. Abong also showed off his good skills, assisting Sanchez with long shots and short attacks, achieving some gains. However, the two Xus retaliated in kind, so there were eight times when they were about to win but could not. The intensity of the competition was evident. In the end, the two Xus grabbed the deciding point and won back one set 6-4, shaking hands and making peace.</p>
<p>…Based on yesterday's performance, Abong was more outstanding than Sanchez. Although his serving technique was poor, his smashes and volleys had dangerous angles. No wonder he was able to overcome the experienced Philippine general, Jiaweiya.</p>
<p>…Sanchez is best at serving. In the two sets he played against the Xu brothers, he scored a total of ten "aces." However, his biggest weakness is that he often misses overheads. If he encounters the He Jialiu and Li Rurong team, who adopt a resilient strategy, he will definitely be threatened.</p>
<p>…The second battle was between the Philippine players and De Fu and Gao Luwen. De Fu played very strongly and served well, but unfortunately, Gao Luwen was of no help and could not resist the Philippine team's attacks, losing 1-2.</p>
<p>First Scene</p>
<p>Sanchez and Abong 6-3, 4-6, Xu brothers</p>
<p>Second Scene</p>
<p>Sanchez and Abong 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, De and Gao</p>
<p>…Because the De Fu and Gao Luwen team played three sets against the Philippine players, it took a long time, which affected the original schedule. The singles match between Little Xu and Abong was forced to be canceled and will be played today. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>First Scene Doubles</p>
<p>Philippine players vs He Jialiu and Li Rurong</p>
<p>Second Scene Singles</p>
<p>Xu Runpei vs Abong</p>

<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>On the Necessary Innovation of Physical Training</p>
<p>According to the leader's pronouncement that "to create a solid foundation for the war of resistance and national construction, the united solidarity and joint efforts of the youth of the whole country are essential," it is evident that the youth occupy an important position in the present situation. Students are the soul of the youth, and the youth of the whole country must advance under their leadership. If we want to make the youth useful to the country, it is obvious that students need to temper themselves and strive forward. In this perilous environment where survival is uncertain, it is clear that only those who are free of melancholy and infirmity, and not decadent and degenerate, can take on the responsibility of leading the youth. Therefore, the importance of physical training for current students is an immutable principle.</p>
<p>Our country has a long history of establishing physical education schools to train students' physical fitness, but to this day, the level of students' physical strength is still not as desirable as we would like. There are many reasons for this, but echoing others' words, blindly following, and adhering to unchanging, outdated methods are among the main reasons. At a time when there is an urgent need for students to have strong physical fitness to shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country from danger, we cannot hope to achieve our goals unless we thoroughly reform the past errors and inappropriate practices. Based on my observations, I offer some suggestions, hoping that students who care about physical training will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>1.  Innovation of concepts: Concepts are like the path taken on a journey. Correct concepts are like a wide, level road with no obstacles ahead. Wrong concepts are like remote, forked paths, full of thorns, and you will inevitably encounter unexpected difficulties. If students hope to achieve results in physical training, they must first start by eliminating wrong concepts and having correct concepts.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Discussion on Handling War Loss <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shanshi</p>
<p>(4) Some may think that listing war losses as deferred assets allows for amortization over several years, which reduces net profit and consequently lowers the income tax burden. However, this is not necessarily true. Income tax calculation requires determining a ratio based on the size of net profit and actual capital to establish the standard for tax rates. Tax rates vary, and net profits differ. The extent of war losses varies greatly across industries, and business performance in the years following the war will also vary. While some businesses may benefit from treating war losses as deferred assets under certain circumstances, others may find it disadvantageous for tax purposes. Therefore, from a tax burden perspective, the benefits of treating war losses as deferred assets for both the government and businesses are mixed and cannot be definitively determined. This is the fourth point for discussion from a tax burden perspective.</p>
<p>(5) For businesses that have suffered war losses, existing public reserves and provisions can be used to offset them in the first year. However, if the shortfall is listed as an asset, it can only be amortized partially during annual settlements. Even if substantial surpluses are generated later, it will be difficult to quickly recover the full amount. Furthermore, it becomes questionable whether public reserves should still be set aside during profitable years, and whether these reserves can still be used to offset war losses. As for the amortization standard for war losses treated as deferred assets, although the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that it should not exceed one-tenth annually, in reality, if war losses need to be determined gradually over several years, the original amount of deferred assets will inevitably fluctuate, making calculations difficult. This is the fifth point for discussion from an accounting practice perspective.</p>
<p>The above points are just some of the major considerations that come to mind. In practice, problems may become more complex due to the varying financial strengths, asset structures, degrees of loss, and future trends of different industries. Thus, it seems inappropriate to treat war losses as deferred assets, amortizing them gradually over ten years or more, from accounting theory, financial policy, legal perspectives, tax burden, accounting practice, and post-war reconstruction. In the author's opinion, the industrial and commercial losses from this war are indeed significant, but since the losses have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, the focus should be on rapid post-war reconstruction. For the sake of industrial and commercial enterprises, rather than clinging to the remnants of the past and struggling to survive, it is better to endure temporary pain and seek stable progress. For those businesses with excessive losses that may be severely damaged and difficult to recover without leniency, it is believed that a reasonable extraordinary arrangement should be sought, but it should be approached in a stable and effective manner, rather than concealing losses or artificially inflating assets, which would only create future troubles. The following are some humble suggestions for handling war losses, but whether they are feasible is uncertain. It is hoped that accounting and business professionals will provide guidance.</p>
<p>1.  Property located in war zones that has been verified as undamaged but cannot be disposed of or fully controlled for the time being should be listed separately as "War Zone Assets." Property that has been verified as damaged should be treated as war losses.</p>
<p>2.  Accounts receivable that existed before the war and have been proven uncollectible should be listed as war losses. Accounts whose collectibility is uncertain due to the debtor's disappearance should be listed as war losses after two years. Accounts that are temporarily uncollectible for reasons other than the debtor's disappearance should be listed separately after verification as "Pre-War Delayed Collection Accounts."</p>
<p>3.  The valuation of property listed as war losses should be based on the last book value before the war. For fixed assets with depreciation reserves, inventory with price drop reserves, and accounts receivable with bad debt reserves, these reserves should be deducted from the original price, and the remaining balance should be listed as the loss.</p>
<p>4.  Depreciation should continue to be deducted annually for "War Zone Assets," and bad debts should continue to be deducted annually for "Pre-War Delayed Collection Accounts."</p>
<p>5.  Maintenance costs for war zone property should be treated as losses for the respective year. Transportation costs for war zone property should be listed as war losses.</p>
<p>6.  Businesses with war zone property that has not been verified and reorganized should allocate all surplus from the settlement to a war loss reserve, without issuing dividends or interest.</p>
<p>7.  War losses that have been verified and confirmed should be compensated for using existing public reserves and provisions as a priority. The remaining amount should be included in the current year's loss calculation.</p>
<p>8.  The order of priority for using public reserves to offset losses should be: retained earnings and undistributed profits first, followed by discretionary public reserves without designated purposes, then discretionary public reserves with designated purposes but no external contractual obligations, and finally statutory public reserves.</p>
<p>9.  If a loss occurs in the current year due to war losses being listed as expenses, the loss amount should be compensated for as a priority in future years when net profit is generated.</p>
<p>10. If the loss amount exceeds one-third of the total capital, a shareholders' meeting should still be convened within a possible scope to decide on a course of action and remedial measures. If the losses are too large, resulting in insufficient assets to cover debts, and the business can still operate and has prospects for recovery, it may be allowed to obtain the consent and understanding of creditors to temporarily avoid declaring bankruptcy. If the business has already stalled and has no prospects for recovery, it should still declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>11. The number of shareholders whose addresses are unknown and cannot be notified when convening a shareholders' meeting may be temporarily excluded from the calculation (this is a temporary relief measure for when a shareholders' meeting cannot be convened).</p>
<p>12. Unpaid shares should be called in immediately when losses are incurred. If they cannot be collected within one year, the shareholder's rights should be suspended. At this time, the calculation of the loss amount should be based on the standard of exceeding one-third of the total paid-in capital after the call (including previous collections). If an increase or decrease in capital is required, the unpaid shares may be combined into whole shares based on the proportion of unpaid amounts for calculation (this clause is a temporary relief measure for the loss of shareholder rights). According to the Company Law, if a shareholder fails to pay after two calls for payment, the company may declare the shareholder's loss of rights and auction off the shares. However, in reality, after the war, shareholders are displaced and relocated, and some may be unable to pay on time due to force majeure. Therefore, for practical considerations, it is advocated that only the exercise of shareholder rights should be suspended. However, if an increase or decrease in capital is required at this time, the only way to implement a capital reduction is to combine the shares first).</p>
<p>13. For businesses that have suffered war losses and consequently incurred losses, before the losses are fully offset, if there is a surplus, the government should temporarily exempt them from income tax obligations to "show sympathy for business difficulties" and protect the tax base. However, once the losses are fully offset, they should still be taxed as usual. (According to income tax regulations, losses from the previous year cannot be included in the calculation for the following year. However, this applies to normal times. In wartime, when businesses have suffered losses, their vitality has been severely damaged, and the cause of the losses is not due to poor management. The government should provide special leniency so that they can be expected to recover soon. At the same time, the government has collected excessive profits tax on businesses that have gained extraordinary profits due to the war, so it should also exempt businesses that have incurred losses due to the war to be fair.)</p>
<p>14. For the sake of protecting the capital turnover of the company and the majority of shareholders, even if war losses have not been fully offset, if the losses do not reach one-third of the total capital, they may be allowed to distribute dividends not exceeding 5% per annum in years with surplus. However, interest income tax on dividend income should still be paid as usual. (The Company Law originally had provisions for construction interest for businesses requiring long-term construction, so it seems appropriate to use it here.)</p>
<p>The above measures are all applicable to the current war period and have a passive nature. As for the future, after the war is over, for the sake of the overall recovery and prosperity of industry and commerce, more active relief measures should be sought, such as issuing reconstruction bonds and providing industrial and commercial loans, which are all effective relief methods. However, as they are not within the scope of this article, they will not be discussed for now. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e89">Fallacies and Facts <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Tian</p>
<p>Before the war, Wang Jingwei delivered a speech on construction plans during a memorial week. In it, he criticized the thinking of Chinese literary writers. "If we examine the literary works that have been popular in the country in recent years, which have had a considerable impact on thinking, we find that most, almost all, of these literary works are filled with negative and destructive ideas about the current social economy, and lack positive and constructive ideas. They seem to be applying the slogan of literary writers, 'Only point out the symptoms but not prescribe the cure,' but this slogan is overused and can be dangerous."</p>
<p>Such a sweeping evaluation of literary works, such casual talk and criticism; overuse can indeed be dangerous.</p>
<p>Looking at our literary writers, everyone has stood on their respective posts to defend the motherland: some are carrying guns on the front lines, becoming heroic soldiers; some are writing explosive texts with their pens, relentlessly fighting against the rumors of traitors and the arguments of pessimists and negativists; some are writing wall newspapers in the countryside, compiling anti-Japanese tunes, and inspiring the fighting spirit of our farmers - a spirit that has been latent in their blood, having existed for generations since their ancestors. These were unforeseen by Wang Jingwei at the time and are unseen by Wang Jingwei today.</p>
<p>Recently: Wang Jingwei's escape abroad and subsequent publication of absurd "electric messages," "举一例," "致华侨某君书," "important statements," etc., are these manifestations of positive and constructive thinking?</p>
<p>Recently: the unanimous telegram from all members of the National Literary Resistance Association condemning Wang, is this also influenced by negative and destructive ideas?</p>
<p>Regarding positive construction, it is so needed in our country, in every aspect! The * people use planes and cannons to destroy the buildings in our cities, and even set fire to the small thatched cottages in remote villages. But, the more irrational the * people are, the more we must fight on, and we must show people reason. Our soldiers and our leaders do not know discouragement. Resistance has become a cause that must be won, just like we must have food every day, otherwise, we will die! Objectively, due to the rise of every citizen, due to the sincere unity of the entire country, and due to the so much and so sincere sympathy on the international side. Indeed, as with all our strong consciousness: we will win, we must win, we want to fight for victory!</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, and before the war broke out, our literary works have consistently appeared in a fighting posture. Qu Qiubai, Lu Xun, and those writers in the struggle, did they only give us the slogan "only point out the symptoms, but not prescribe the cure"?</p>
<p>Regarding the social economy at that time, if we are to ask our literary writers to play a role of positive and constructive thinking, why didn't Wang Jingwei say this: "Come, accept the neighbor's grace, China's disease is not enough to attend to."</p>
<p>Facts finally proved everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the motherland was not accidental. Consistently, he embraced an erroneous thought: constantly, he carelessly misdirected.</p>
<p>Day. 已比塞 said: "...in life there is no rational basis, will inevitably fall into the abyss of suppression and sink into disappointment."</p>
<p>In "举一个例," Wang Jingwei is a bit pessimistic to the point of being "pathetic."</p>
<p>Our literary writers, even if they do not go to the front lines, then revealing a little of the traitors' ignorance and insidious features - and constantly fighting resolutely against their "theories," is also a force, and it is an objective need.</p>
<p>Those traitors' theories, if embodied, will gain even more people's curses.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Sneaking into Wuhu City (Continued) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>Silhouettes of * people occupying the city</p>
<p>But, no matter what, it wouldn't work. Pulling and scolding all the way, they headed towards the grain depot. After a while, the sound of miserable screams mixed with the smell of roasting flesh reached people's ears, noses...hearts...No one dared to listen to this tragic cry for help anymore! This time, more than a hundred wounded soldiers were burned. In Wuhu, the cries of wounded soldiers being burned like this had been heard countless times. This told the common people that if the Japanese were treating their own people like this, what about the Chinese...</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the enemy's actions in Wuhu:</p>
<p>March 28th was the anniversary of the Reorganized National Government. The puppet county government ordered grand celebrations, lantern festivals, and street parades. Lecture meetings were held in the city and suburbs, with the main content of the lectures being three points:</p>
<p>(1) In the political aspect, "oppose Chiang," "oppose the Communists," "oppose England," and "support Wang."</p>
<p>(2) In the economic aspect, "revive industry" and "revitalize the countryside"!</p>
<p>(3) In the aspect of "social order," compile Baojia and improve civil certificates into residence permits.</p>
<p>Now I will record a few passages of the lecture to show a glimpse:</p>
<p>"...Who is the real enemy of China? It is * imperialism, which has demarcated concessions everywhere since the Opium War, and ceded territories...extorting debt from the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and recently borrowing money from the Party government, this is the ironclad proof of economic aggression...You see those blue-eyed, high-nosed, yellow-haired people, that is the real devils, that is our enemy! "Japan is a military" and China is of the same origin, and looks like the Chinese, they are the descendants of Qin Shi Huang...this time is to "return home" to "suppress bandits"...so we should support..."</p>
<p>"...Why is China not peaceful now? It is because Chiang Kai-shek has been communized, listens to the words of the Communist Party, and throws social order into chaos. The 'Imperial Army' is fighting with them to protect the people..."</p>
<p>"...Compiling Baojia is to prevent troublemakers and protect good people to live and work in peace. Therefore, they organize "Anti-Communist Youth League," "Anti-Communist Self-Defense," "Anti-British United Association," plus the existing "Great People's Association"...etc., using Wang Jingwei's remarks and neighborhood declarations as a "theoretical basis" to vigorously carry out the "three oppositions" work.</p>
<p>From April 1st, they began issuing residence permits, with Baojia as the unit. They had to fill out applications and provide two 2.5-inch photos; of course, they had to spend some unjust money. Baojia was restored before that. According to the traitor's "Wuhu Xinbao," 240 Bao and 2,415 Jia have been compiled.</p>
<p>Do you think the common people don't understand these tricks? Humph, after more than a year of experience and lessons, everyone in China knows that "opposing England" is to shift the goal of "resisting Japan" and threaten England not to help us. "Opposing Chiang and opposing the Communists" needless to say, it is a consistent slogan and conspiracy of the Japanese invaders. The so-called groups and associations, as well as the compiling of Baojia, are completely a deception by the * people. It is a new means by the enemy of repeatedly drafting men in Wuhu and other places and suffering defeat. Therefore, the common people's way of dealing with them is "two-sided faction." On the one hand, they perfunctorily treat the * people and delay the enemy's attempt to compile Baojia in various ways; on the other hand, they try to cover up the Chinese "gerber birds" active in Wuhu, and try to convey all kinds of news to the National Army and the guerrilla teams surrounding * Lake, and also try to find out the correct news of our resistance - until now, most of the Wuhu compatriots still do not believe that Wuhan has fallen, because they only see the treacherous "Wuhu Xinbao," which is in a big trend, thinking that the fall of Wuhan is a rumor made by traitors; Not among the common people. The Chinese who serve * people are also mostly like this. As long as our army wins, they will definitely waver. If it comes to the counter-offensive, they may still be "thorough Chinese!" The following event is a concrete proof;</p>
<p>On April 4th, the enemy transferred 210 members of the "Anti-Communist Youth League" to Nanjing for training, but they all ran away on the way, not even one! The * people's "Lianwei Bao" also could not act, because most of them ran away, one set was a large batch, isn't this a big joke for his "appeasement policy"? Who can say, who dares to say; Wuhu is finished? (End)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Surpassing the Previous Generation <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>We take on a job, from the previous generation's hands.</p>
<p>A history of mankind. It should be painted with the blood of struggle, with the martyrdom of martyrs, and the putrid stench of ghosts and goblins, like dragons and snakes fighting each other, twisting and fighting for tens of millions of years, with light and darkness replacing each other. There is no eternal light, nor is there permanent darkness.</p>
<p>Righteous people sacrifice themselves and fight to seize the light from the hands of "evil." The spark of fire was seized by the "evil" one, and the universe became a hell, deep, dark, and cold. No sun, no moon, no stars, no light. The timid ones trembled in the cold, groaning, weeping, complaining, quietly dying in depression. The brave, the steadfast, the insightful. Cannot succumb to fate, they each raised their arms and rose up, willing to entrust their own flesh and blood to the mountain road; thus, building a bridge. To allow their descendants to cross the deep water, cross the dark valley, and climb the mountain peak.</p>
<p>The fire came, and the "evil" world belonged to the brave, the steadfast, the insightful, the ones who fought for the light.</p>
<p>Like hibernating insects, silently hiding, "evil" has not disappeared. When there is an opportunity, it will rise up, from the mud, from under the tree roots. Thus the "evil" that has died but not been destroyed will be reborn. In the history of mankind, we will again see the struggle between snakes and dragons.</p>
<p>The root of "evil" has never been cut off. Therefore "justice" can never be at peace. Light ascends to the sky. Darkness quietly crawls onto the earth; "morality" has only become slightly tired, and the clown wants to strangle it to death; the small boat of "justice" sailing in the sea, the brutal carp often wants to take it to satisfy its hunger.</p>
<p>"Evil" never repents. Often those who condone "evil" will soon be harmed by evil. At this time, those who help evil to do evil, the accomplices of evil, the flatterers, do not want to praise the declining justice. They call it: the cowardly, the incompetent, the ones who are eliminated by natural selection.</p>
<p>When "evil" is rampant, we are easily infected and attacked, so we want to build a fortress of justice to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, we have been moved by the fortresses left by our ancestors, half of which have been destroyed, and half of which are not strong enough. "Evil" can invade at any time. Although we repelled it for a while, it has not been eradicated. For the sake of long-term peace and stability, we are building a new fortress, greater and more solid.</p>
<p>Erecting tall wooden frames, driving down long ropes, and using heavy stones, forcefully striking down. We strike, strike, and drive piles - we build a foundation. Build a foundation for justice for tens of millions of years ago, and for tens of millions of years to come, deep, thick, broad, and never wavering.</p>
<p>Sweat dripping from the forehead, and hands and feet also calloused, this is indeed a bitter thing. Our previous generation did not do it, our friends did not do it, but the troubled us carry it on iron-like shoulders.</p>
<p>"If it is for self-defense, then driving away 'evil' is enough, why do you need to build a greater, more solid fortress?" Some people ridiculed us for being too busy and not knowing how to be clever. But we don't care about these. We are willing to sacrifice ourselves and strive for permanent justice, protecting ourselves, and even more protecting our friends; planning for ourselves, and even more for our descendants.</p>
<p>Not only laying a deeper and thicker foundation, but we must also engage in close combat with "evil," clearing the sands of defeat, blowing out the embers of cold ash. Give the universe of tens of millions of years a pool of clear water, removing those permanent silences.</p>
<p>Although our previous generation also had a fortress, and also drove away "evil," but now the fortress is about to collapse, and "evil" has not been eradicated. People have passed by, taking away laughter, taking away tears, sunny days and cloudy days, sadness and happiness, leaving the fragrance of Du Ruo, and also leaving the pungent stench of Penghao. The walls of "justice" have been erected, and the snakes of "evil" are stirring again, shaking, shaking. Don't you see, the boars and snakes are always coveting us, wanting to swallow the light in two bites? You say, can we still live in peace?</p>
<p>It is not a time to live in peace, nor is it a time to retreat. Even a single spark can start a prairie fire, and in the land where "evil" is buried, humanity can never be at peace.</p>
<p>Dig up the burials in that place, capture. Destroy the "evil" in your place, build a strong fortress, for others, and for yourself.</p>
<p>Wash clean the universe of tens of millions of years, leaving no trace of the dregs of "evil," cleanse the putrid stench of the dead from the "past" grave, and then tear off the mask of "today" from the remnants of the attack.</p>
<p>When pursuing the fleeing enemy, we are the vanguard; when building a fortress, we are the first to raise the base of the pile driver high.</p>
<p>Sow the seeds of "justice", one day they will bloom, and bless the people of the world. Let us build a fortress of happiness.</p>
<p>In the previous generation, "evil" was not eradicated, and our work must surpass the previous generation, so that it will never be reborn.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Snow in Manchuria <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"No, there is a piano score."</p>
<p>"Ah, and a dagger!"</p>
<p>He didn't mean to say it, but was coaxed into it. But the more she said it, the redder her cheeks became, like they were painted with rouge; the regret was unforgettable. She playfully slapped him, stopping him from mentioning the words "dagger" again.</p>
<p>The snow kept falling, and everywhere was covered with snow. Snowdrifts piled up on the sides of the streets, forming snow mountains; the snow-covered roads narrowed. It was already hindering the progress of people and vehicles. The pedestrian paths swept clean in the morning were already closed off by snow again. The accumulated snow dragged under their feet was higher than their ankles, almost soaking into their overshoes.</p>
<p>The roar of the storm could be heard from afar, and in the wind, it seemed as if countless steel needles were hidden, piercing every pore of their faces; but they didn't feel it, because their blood was hot; and they harbored a kind of fervent hope. This hope could subdue the cold of the frigid zone.</p>
<p>There were few pedestrians on the street, and more horse-drawn carriages and snow; countless icicles formed on the fur behind the horses' hooves, and when they ran, the sound was like copper bells, coupled with the bells of the church, which to her ears, was still that extraordinarily beautiful music of the past. Only her eyes couldn't bear the reflection of the snow-covered ground; this snow-covered ground seemed to have more scattered golden stars than before.</p>
<p>"Are we almost home?"</p>
<p>She looked at the end of a street, which was constantly flashing with light—reflected by the snow-covered ground and not clearly visible: so she asked him. He looked and told her there was still half the distance to go. She asked again:</p>
<p>"Would you like to take me all the way home?"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>"Then why don't you come in for a while before you leave?"</p>
<p>"Strange, how can I still go to your house? Doesn't that gossipy old woman in your house recognize me?"</p>
<p>"With me here, what are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>He still had some concerns about her talkative maid.</p>
<p>However, she met her; and, followed by several detectives. As soon as she saw Zhu Lin, she ignored Yu Wen, and followed. Her words began:</p>
<p>"Miss! I really missed you so much, these three days felt like thirty years! Oh, my hair has all turned white!—"</p>
<p>If Zhu Lin didn't stop her, her words wouldn't have ended. Zhu Lin looked at the ground and the several detectives, and became blank.</p>
<p>Then, the maid told Zhu Lin that the detectives had already found clues to the case and were going to arrest the criminals; and they also wanted her to identify the ringleader who kidnapped Zhu Lin.</p>
<p>Zhu Lin sighed hypocritically and said:</p>
<p>"Now it's too late!" (68)</p>
