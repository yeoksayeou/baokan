<p>社評</p>
<h3>增強軍隊抗戰中的政治工作</h3>
<p>我國抗日戰爭已從第一階段轉入第二階段，爲了展開全面戰爭，爭取最後勝利，則增强軍隊中的政治工作實爲目前最切要的事項。現在中樞當局除了仿照北伐時代恢復軍隊中的政治組織以外，又在訓練大批政治工作人員，以資調用。在廣東有所謂政治工作大隊，策動民衆，從事抗戰，在廣西也組織了男女靑年學生，分赴各游擊區，跟隨軍隊，担任政治工作。其他，如蜀，湘，滇，黔，以及各游擊區域，也正在設法積極推進。這些設施，是增强軍隊戰鬥力的動力，爭取勝利的捷徑。</p>
<p>要完成第一個任務，第一必使全體將士了解此次戰爭的意義與前途，懂得這是國民革命過程中所必經的途程，是爲求生存獨立而戰爭。世界上一切愛好和平的國家因此都表示同情，給予援助，據現象觀之，前途是很右勝利把握的。第二要使全體將士養成刻苦耐勞，爲國犧牲的精神。第三要使每個將士都能自覺的嚴守紀律，信任自己的指揮員，堅决地執行命令和服從指揮，發揚部隊的友愛精神，鞏固內部的團結。</p>
<p>要完成第二個任務，必須使軍隊與人民有密切的聯絡。軍隊不但不能侵犯人民的利益，而且要在抗戰的前提之下，設法解除民衆的痛苦，與民衆結合，成爲民衆的武力。同時組織民衆，動員民衆，這樣，才能和民衆保持最親密的關係。</p>
<p>根擬歷史的經騐，要爭取戰爭的最後勝利，不是單靠技術可以濟事的，最重要的，還是要有正確的政策，和獲得民衆的擁護。例如一九二五到一九二七的中國大革命，國民革命軍以比較落後的設備，在很短的時期以內，掃蕩奉直軍閥，建立統一基礎，這迅速的成功，原因固然甚多，但是軍隊中有着政治工作的設施和獲得廣大民衆的擁護，却是重要原因之一。現在我國抵抗日本的侵略，就車隊設備而言，比諸日本，當然還不如國民革命軍之與奉直軍閥所統率的軍隊；所以要爭取最後勝利無疑的是要靠廣大民衆的力量。不但在軍事上要動員廣大的民衆，在政治上也要動員全國的民衆。</p>
<p>軍隊中的政治工作，其基本任務可分三方面來說：第一，是要鞏固部隊和提高部隊的戰鬥力；第二是要使無數人民團結起來帮同並協助軍隊作戰；第三是要從政治上影響對方內部，瓦解對方軍隊。</p>
<p>要完成第三個任務，須啓發對方下層份子的政治覺悟，利用對方軍隊的反戰情緒；因對方軍隊非由異地異族强迫調集，卽由其本國農工大衆徵發而來。他們對於財閥軍閥本已深感不滿，正可號召他們，組織起來，以反對戰爭，而促日本軍閥的覺悟。</p>
<p>過去我國當局，對於軍隊中的政治工作，似乎尚少注意到，尤其是在各地游擊區內。游擊區內民衆雖已飽嘗日本軍閥侵略的痛苦，亟想起而反抗，可是他們不但政治修養不足，連自己的環境都認不淸楚，更何能組織起來，帮助軍隊作戰？這種行爲，倘不立加糾正，則安能擔保有些民衆不但不覺察日人的欺騙，反而實行支持侵略者？幸現在我國當局，已注意及此，並已實施了一些步驟，我人深望由此切實執行，以實現上述的三個任務，以最小的犧牲，博取偉大的勝利！</p>

<p>交通旅行</p>
<h3>中蘇公路（續三）</h3>
<p>— 張公爽</p>
<p>溝通中蘇直接交通的大動脈</p>
<p>商業很發達、中亞和歐俄的鑛產、家畜日川工業品的貿易、中　貨物的交換、都量以這裏做轉口地的、現在，更是變成蘇聯軍火運華的集中地了、</p>
<p>中　公路因爲路綫太延長、工程太艱鉅的關係、全路還有訂多令人不能滿意的地方、除屬於蘇聯的一段（塔斜段）很好外、其他像費去了一百多萬元修造的西蘭路工程也潦草得很、涵洞　少、路基不堅實的地方很多，</p>
<p>甘新路永登、古浪、武威這一段、橋樑建築不堅固、常有被水冲壞的危險、自酒泉以西直到猩猩峽這段、既有戈壁、沙窩、又有　灘、泥地、車行戈壁上尚沒有問題、沙窩、　灘、泥地、常要沒車輪、以致不能行駛</p>
<p>這種種缺點、現在正由政府令飭各該省府和路局極力改進、有的培修、有的改建、在茫無人烟處的地方多設站口、使這條中國西北的大動脈、積極地活　起來、好擔負偉大的艱苦的工作、</p>
<p>自去年「八一三」全面抗戰爆發後、本路運輸突然繁忙、新省邊防督辦盛世才氏立刻集中大批運貨汽車、馬車、駱駝，騾子等、專供運輸軍需的用途、他對東來的記者說、新疆所能給予中央助力的、惟一是交通方面、所以我集中了這些車　駱駝等、希望軍火能早一時送到火綫、那就算我責任了</p>
<p>戰爭幾個月後、政府又從蘇聯購買新式運　車、還把東部的汽車開入、參加駛行、所以、本路上的汽車現在也够得上說　繹不絕了、總　全路四十三　　　一公里、自塞米巴拉敦斯克至西安、汽車約行二十日可到、而現在是全路各段大站都集有許多車輛和精良的司機、前一站的汽車開到後一站時、倘使司機乏了就掉換生力的　機、　　　了就　　　轉卸到站上補充的車輛、然後再開、這種仿照舊日「驊遞」的方法、的確是可以使軍需品更快一些到達目的地的、　（完）</p>
<h3>國府利用英國放欵　完成西南鐵道綱　滇緬路二年內竣工　縮短歐洲國際運輸</h3>
<p>國府對於發展西南鐵路交通、早有計劃、分別完成寶成、川康、成渝、川黔、黔桂、粵桂、湘黔、滇黔、滇緬、湘桂、　越等十一大綫、其路綫共長六千四百公里、但以工程浩大、需費尤夥、當非短時期內所能完成、刻特組設西南經　　設委員會、由財長孔祥　及張羣分任正副委員長、籌欵二千萬元、作爲基金、詳擬計劃、决在可能範圍內、力謀次第完成。</p>
<p>借欵成功積極興築</p>
<p>自英國允借信用放欵一千萬鎊、指定作爲購辦鐵路等各種材料之用後、政府當局、决先築由黔滇兩省通至緬甸之滇緬鐵路、該路由雲南省會之昆明、向西進展、沿途經過廣通、　南、楚雄、彌波、大理、保山、騰衝等　、至中緬邊界之蠻允鎭、再由蠻允通至緬甸之八莫、全綫約長一千二百公里、約二年內可望完成、</p>
<p>打通歐洲國際運輸</p>
<p>滇緬鐵路之建築、對于打通歐洲國際交通、實有重大　義、蓋該路終　之八莫、已有鐵路通至緬甸海口之仰光、故滇緬鐵路完成後、二、鐵路卽可在八莫啣接、則中國西　部與歐洲航程、大可縮短、不必再遠繞馬來半島、可逕在仰光登陸、乘搭火車直抵昆明、至少可省一星期之海、目下滇緬、路已告竣工通車、對於建築材料之運輸、益臻便利、</p>
<p>黔滇等路測量完竣</p>
<p>由貴陽至昆明之滇黔鐵路、長約七百五十公里、需建築費六千萬元、及自四川叙府至昆明之川漢鐵路、均已測量完竣、不日卽可興工、尚有在建築中之成兪鐵路、係向法銀團借款三千四百五—萬元、由政府與國內金融界集資二千萬元、合組川黔鐵路公司負實建築、預定明年夏季完成、</p>
<h3>華人在香港　領取出國護照辦法</h3>
<p>繳費商人六元工人學生四元　並須紳商店號擔保始準發給</p>
<p>自軍典以後、民衆出國者皆轉道香港、自廣州失陷後、外交部所設出以護照部在港成立駐港簽證專員辦事處、於去年十二月十二日起正式簽發、茲將辦理手續、詳誌於後、</p>
<p>成立經過</p>
<p>自廣州淪陷後、民衆領照出國謀生者、極　困難、政府爲顧盧民生利便國人出外營生起見、特由外部行文英政府磋商、暫時在本港成立出國護照簽發處、（現設本港德輔道中五樓六號）委　　　　　　　　任、嗣經英方予以同意、初本規定於去年十二月一日開始簽發、　因籌備手續關係，後改作十二日止式簽發、</p>
<p>領照手續</p>
<p>現時在港辦理護照手、與前辦理方法微有不同，領照者經簽發處嚴密審查、並須由香港本　紳商或店號担保、始准發給、如發覺有可疑之點、該處卽予拒絕簽發、至所領護照、如赴各國屬地者、則須由各該　駐港領事簽署、方可出國、費用商人護照應繳照費爲港幣四元、印花二元、計共六元、工人學生應繳照費二元、印花二元、計共四元、領照日期約爲四五天、至上項領照手續係暫行辦法、將來外部或有變更云、</p>
<h3>船務特訉</h3>
<p>太子洋行之中國太于Chinese　Prince輪船、昨由紐約首途、經上海來港、將于今晚八時抵步·寄泊于九龍倉橋碼頭查該輪運來貨物、約共千餘噸、一俟貨物淸卸後、卽行駛入太古船塢、作例定之修理云、又該行代理之司路化司打號Sllvercedar或將于明日抵港云、</p>
<p>昌興公司之日本皇后，今晨由小呂宋抵港、寄泊子九龍倉橋、一俟客貨淸卸後、幷卽行入塢修理、將於本月廿四日（星期二）正午首途開有上海、神戶、大阪、檀香山、加拿大、温高華等埠云、</p>
<h3>自倫敦到巴黎（二）</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>我這次預備在大陸上居住的時間、最少也在一月以上、况且我還要到德瑞比荷等國去參觀、所以一月的時間、萬萬不數支配、祗得遵照規定、填送請求　、聽候决定、從六月十旬起、一直守候到七月初、巴黎的回訓方權到、因爲我是學生、想來也許不致於謀什麽職業、總算是邀　了、但是護照上面、還是用大字寫有、「持此護照的人、絕對小得在法國担任的酬報，或無酬報的工作、」領館人員、也以此鄭重見　、失業問隨的嚴重、不難從這小小一端獲得一個有力的反證了、（英國對於入境人民、也有同樣規定、）</p>
<p>護照問題解决之後、便在通濟隆買了車票、從倫敦到巴黎、共有四條路線、以杜　開雷線爲戰近、所經海峽的時間最短、代價也比較昂貴些、以紐海温、迪愛勃線爲最遠、所經海峽的時間也最長、不消　、代價也低廉此、普通旅客、多走紐海溫迪愛勃　、我也是選定了這一條路、單程三等寫一鎊十先令左右、外冉買一張遊覺證、以後在　國旅行、可以憑此六折購票，七月四日的早晨、我携了簡單的行發、辭別了已住了一年的房東小姐、獨自的到維多利亞車站、滿想早　去、可以覓得一個較好座位、豈知我八時半到　、列軍尚未開來、一直守待到九時半、列車纔進站、那時赴歐的旅客、已擁擠不堪、好容易上了車、一看三等車座、許多已貼着「預定」字樣、原來英國鐵路、有預定座位的規定、代價是一仙令、我內事先失于注意、因此臨時感到十二分的困難、奔走　久、纔得到一個座位、這時站上公布着當犬海峽的風浪情形、上面說、「有微風無霧」、英吉利海峽的風濤、是舉世聞名的，所以往來英法的人、對於渡過海峽、心裏常懷着無限戒心、紐海　、迪　勃線之所以低廉、正是因爲波峽較久之故、大家看到車姑的報告、心裏比較安定此、然而臨時　無變化、　知道呢、</p>
<p>十時另九分車開了、約摸行了兩小時吧、便到了英國的海口紐海温、由此下車、登「比利斯多爾」　輪、波輪上的擁擠、自然更小消說、所幸臨時無意中遇到一位英國太太米亞夫人，她在愛丁堡某大學教書、平時也常和中國學生見面、又因爲她有一個親戚、曾住福州多年、所以對於中國人特到有些好感、當時米亞夫人代我覓到一個座位、和我閒談着中國的時事、表示萬分感慨、萬里孤舟之中、不期能遇到一位眞正了解中國者、</p>
<p>船快開了、忽然又　上了一大批人、男女老幼約有一百多人、其中有幾位女子因爲無法覓座、跑到我和米亞夫人同坐的船舷來、和她們接談之後，方纔知道這一批人、原來是西班牙的歌劇團、她們說、「因爲戰爭的原因、祗得出來賣藝糊口、」我看到她們的遭遇、又聯想到自己、眞有所謂「同是天涯淪落人、相逢何必曾相識，」的感想、自然、談到中國、她們更是不勝同情、我說「你們的家在何處呢、」她們的回答是、「家已被戰爭燬去了、以後祇有　零天涯了、」唉、戰爭是多麽罪惡呀、</p>
<p>船在十二時半開行、至此、大家的態度、似乎有些不自然、我有米亞夫人凝神不語、我問她、「你怕暈船嗎、」米亞夫人似乎不快樂的說、「最好不要提　這件事，」我說、「今天風很小、也許下會有問題的、」米亞夫人說、「你要知道、這是在港　呀、出了海港、誰也不知道那裏的情形、一我看到她正襟危坐的神情、到也不免有些緊張起來、</p>
<p>渡輪出了港口、似乎風大了些、然而也很尋常、我自從去年到英以後、快一年沒有過海上生活了、這次憑欄遠眺、望着茫無際岸的碧海、襯着幾座靑山、炳波浩渺、不禁聯想到去年橫　印度洋的光景、時間過得何等快、轉瞬又是一年了、在這短短一年之中、世事變　、多麽可驚呀、</p>
<p>船上有西餐可吃、但代價十分高昂、老於赴歐的人們、早已帶了大袋的乾糧、我是沒有這些經騐的、承米亞夫人的盛意、送給我些夾肉麵包、歌劇團的團員、也請我加入他們用餐、大家暢談了一會、絲毫不感到寂寞、他們又把日配簿拿來、請我題些中國字、他們看了、感覺得濃厚的與趣、末了、我把他們的芳名、都譯成中文、題在各人的日記簿上、也算是海航中可以值得紀念的一件事、</p>
<p>浪是很微弱、米亞夫人也開始談笑了、但是坐在船邊的我們、却受着海風的襲擊而有些寒意、米亞夫人把絨氍麥緊了全身、他望着我說、「我有你很冷、下艙去吧」、的確、我有些受不住了，祗得走下艙去、不多時看見許多旅客都下了艙、原來法國的迪愛勃海港　遙遙在望、三小時的海程、就可結束了、</p>
<p>約摸下午三時、船傍了埠頭、這一次總算逃過了海峽的怒濤、大家都互相慶賀着、米亞夫人臨別、交給我一個通信處說、「以後有機會可以常常通信、」我謝了他之後、就此告別了、天涯海角，後會不知何年何月呢，上了岸、第一個印象就是「英文到此不能通行」、任何人都得說法文、僅僅的隔了一個海峽罷了、言語已完全不同了、當時盈千的旅客、守候着法國關員的檢查、關員僅有二三人、如何能在短時期內應付這些旅客呢、於是檢查的時候、也就得十分草草、這和英國人的任何事都要嚴格執行、有極顯著的不同點、我們常可從微細的地方、看出各國的國民性、法國人遇事往往隨便、到了巴黎以後、更得到不少證明</p>
<p>關吏檢查完畢、開往巴黎的專車、已早守候在　頭了、三等車本來就很少、而幾乎十分之八九已有預定、因此沒有定　的旅客、便遭受到和倫敦上車時同樣的狼狽、大家眼巴巴的望着貼着「已預定」的空句房發呆、我們祇得暫目站在鐵道旁邊　備由此一直站到巴黎，所幸開車前五分鐘、忽有若干已預定而沒有來的空位騰出、侍者招待找們入內、方纔如釋重負、因此我感到以後如果在國外　歷、最好在可能範圍以內、把座位預定了、如此便可省却臨時不少的麻煩、</p>
<p>自迪愛勃到巴黎、專車沿途概不停靠、風馳電掣的橫跨過法蘭西的原野、但見碧油油的靑山裏、間着碧垣朱互的田舍、很富有詩情畫意、據聞赴法四條路線之中、以這線沿途所經的地域爲最美、法國以農立國、和中國很有些相似之處、可是它的稼穡方法、却已完　探甩新式工具、就我所見到的、如機器割麥、機器抽水之類、已很普通、然而中國的農村、可以說還逗留在原時期呢、</p>
<p>「巴黎到了」、在一陣喧擾之後、大家走出了聖拉柴車站、我承友介紹、嘱住沙朋旅館、因爲這裏接近學生所住的區域、按圖索驥的坐了地道車、換了一次之後。終於到了所要到的「克留尼」站、出了地道、看見許多設在大街　的咖啡座、已人山人海、我也無心瀏覽這些、東區西問、好容易找到沙朋旅館、豈知它已告客滿、隔壁一家有呌做「留德斯」的、也和沙朋　　、在那裏覓到一個房間、比我在倫敦時所住的房大一倍、可是房租每月僅二百七十五佛郎、每天僅台九佛郎餘、眞有出乎意外的低廉了、</p>
<p>奔波了一大、乘了兩次火車、波了一次海峽、在途中整整　七小時、舟車上下、免不了有些勞頓、在附近的北京飯館進了一頓豐美中餐以後、便囘寓休息了、</p>

<p>無論其　公法、爲私法、爲戰時、爲平時、民間所經營之工商業、决無有强行覇奪併吞沒收之理、獨中國所有暫時放棄之地方、凡有大小工廠公司以及大宗農產、悉爲人所刦奪把持、有時尚美具名曰合作、其實鵲巢鳩占、有何作之可合、復有何「平等」之可言、東北三省之公　、已無中國人經營之地步、具原有之公司工廠、百分之八上五、已轉歸於日人之手、如此下去、中國人固無飯之所、歐美人尚有何生意之可言、茲據日本報章雜誌所記戰爲之　述於後、以見摧殘之一斑、</p>
<p>悉據淞滬一帶工廠</p>
<p>上海淪陷後、日本商人卽總軍事行動之後、來滬大肆活動、非但恢復其原有之工廠、且欲用其威脅利誘之手段、勾引　志　弱之華商、與之「合作」、有遠識者拒不肯從、雖其最後命運、不免在所謂「軍管理」下爲所接管、或由「宣撫班」接收而委託當地「維持會」接辦、或竟由日商霸占復業、藉爲　刮財源之一策、惟此種甯　碎、無瓦全的民族精神、雖一時或有損失、但最後仍能恢復其舊觀、發展其事業、至或甘心作倀、翼獲一時之利、與之合作、或　倫摸摸、委託其經營、或將淪陷區內之企業、出售於彼、而不自覺已陷於萬刦不復之地者、甚爲可惜、茲據日本東洋經濟新報駐滬記者最近調查、在江浙一帶淪陷區內、原由華商經營之紗廠、絲　、麵粉廠、水泥廠、化學工業等等、業已委曲求全而在日人手中復工、或已進行「共同經營」者、或爲所「霸占」而開工者、有如下述</p>
<p>（一）紡織工業　江浙一帶淪陷區內、現由日人經營之華商紗　、計有三十七家、約有紗錠六上萬枚、布機五千三百餘台、</p>
<p>（二）蠶絲工業無錫、蘇州、上海西郊、杭州、湖州、嘉興、海甯、　淸等地之絲廠、則在日方爲大股東的一華中蠶絲株式會社　所經營（資金共八百萬日元、現金股六百萬、　由日方估有、現在實繳者僅三百萬、餘二百萬爲實物股、則由華方依現有生產設備等折算繳齊）</p>
<p>（三）麵粉工業　上海郊外之四家華商粉廠、已决定對日商三井及三菱合營之「製粉會社」實行「共同經營」、其中一廠自己開工、此外已决定與日「合作」者、尚有南京楊子麵粉廠之與佐　　一、無錫九　麵粉廠之與上海吉田號之「合辦」是、</p>
<p>（四）水泥工業　與日商小野出水鬥土侏式會社「合辨』者有上海水泥公司、南京之江南水泥公司、南京之中國水泥公司、則與日商之磐城水門土株式會社「合作經營」、</p>
<p>（五）涌口之永利化學工業社硫安廠、已委託日商東洋商壓工業會社經營、現正復舊修理中、</p>
<p>（六）上海之江南造船廠、則早在日海軍之「軍管理一下、而委託三夢重工業會社操作中、</p>
<p>此外上海四郊之華商工廠、現與日商「共與經營」而經查明者、據說有如次數家云云、</p>

<h3>點綴勝利的新年　一個不凡的盛會　印刷業工會週年紀念會速寫</h3>
<p>元旦的孔聖堂，貼滿了這樣的『紅對聯』：『欲求利益·須盡義務』；「在公允合理的原則下，改善我們的生活』；「勞資打成一片，增進戰時生產』；「響應一元運動，復興中華民族」；「……』香港印刷業工會的週年紀念會，就在這樣的一個禮堂舉行。</p>
<p>工友們晚去了油迹骯髒的工服而換上了新裝；這個僅有的「白天」是過慣「夜住活」者的良晨；他們個個人都帶着『歡悅」的笑臉集體來過年；他們個個人對於新年都充滿着無限的希望。</p>
<p>『工友們：讓你們新年如意合　吧！你們是社會進化的有力推動者』——記者衷心致具崇崇的敬意。</p>
<p>恭賀新禧，行禮，報告，演說，提案……開會的儀式一幕　翻了過去。而使記者深受感動的，却是他們的歌詠和茶話之台。</p>
<p>我們平時所看得到的歌詠隊，多數是屬于靑年學生與學校兒童的玩意；可是，站在舞台上面怒吼起來的這個印刷業工會歌詠隊却全是離開了學校的工人。他們三十多人排成二行，中間幾位女工友留着辮，擦些脂粉，着了綠色的新裝，不時古羞而高興地笑了起來，好像嬌傲她不僅是人家的媳媂，嬌傲她並不是附屬權貴的玩物，而是靠着自己的勞力，推動社會淮化的工人。她們雖然上了年紀，物質生活的痛苦句圍着她們周身，可是，她們仍然會唱歌，仍然留住她們的靑春。這是多麽使人感動，</p>
<p>還有一部份上了年紀的男工友，臉上刻着飽經風雜的縐痕，身上着了「商人型」的長衫兒，居然亦放開喉嚨唱起救　歌曲，好像驕傲他並不是「唯利是圖一的奸商；驕傲他仍能與自己的兒女弟妹一樣天眞，這又是多麽使人感奮！</p>
<p>他們一連歌詠了七八支救亡歌曲，「他殺死我們同胞』，「他强佔我們土地「……」武漢合唱團在香港播下的種子，連工人團僅亦萌莽起來。震人心肺的民族歌聲，使人悚然警覺置身在大時代的洪流之中，</p>
<p>招待來賓的茶話會是設在天井的一個小角落；桌椅的擺佈和木桌上堆得滿滿的樸素茶點，—足地表現了工人的本色。難然不像一般設在某某酒樓那樣華貴的宴會，可是工友們的眞實的表露，倒是使人覺得可感亦可愛。</p>
<p>茶話之後，蒙該會負責人林君光甫語記者：全香港印刷工友有五千多，已入工會的佔三千多人·</p>
<p>關於該會過去做過的工作除在可能範圍內參加救亡運動外，國語班，歌詠，救護，戲劇，運動，都有相當的成績表現。新年，還要强化與展開時事座談。工業技術改進座談，常識座談等自我教育工作。我們熱誠　希望工友們努力提高自己的文化水準與生活水準，在道個民挨復興的新年。</p>
<p>元旦參加這個饒有意趣的盛會，帶一顆興奮了的心情歸來。（奇卓）</p>

<h3>致富捷徑的秘密</h3>
<p>— 朱羽屏</p>
<p>總理說：我們中國沒有貧富的懸殊，只有大貧和小貧的差別。果然，我們拿中國的富人來跟歐美的闊好人大老比較一下，眞是可憐得很—爲什麽中國只是貧，沒有富呢　理由又告訴我　：因爲中國是一個次殖民地，我們受着帝國主義者的經濟壓迫的緣故。</p>
<p>窮人吃的菜根也不能够吃得飽；有錢的人却司以坐汽車，住洋房，吃大菜，誰不希望自己能够闊綽，也能够亨受一下汽車洋房大菜的滋味。然而·似乎大多數人還不能得够。總理告訴我們的道理：我們必須剷除了侵略者的壓迫，掙囘我們民族的財富·我們才能够過好的生活。因此人們只想到怎樣去得到錢。他們想到的方法　通有兩途：一個是辛辛苦苦地做工，省省儉儉地希望積下幾個錢；一個是去做投機賭博的事業，希望微倖發財。於是在這　貧窮的中國，投機賭博的行　似乎是特別流行·這是有它的社會的根源的。</p>
<p>迎合着這個心理的要求，社會上就出現了許多教　致富捷徑之類的把戲。最近我在報章上發現了一段教授致富　徑的廣告，它的大意是說：在這個大家部感到失業痛苦的時候，我可以教授你一個致富的捷徑，但在教授你學會了之後，要無條件的給我服務三年。</p>
<p>看起來，這所謂致富捷徑大概不過是教授職業技術而已。究竟能不能够致富呢？且看後話。</p>
<p>記得前兩年一位什麽大王——就是有錢的大好老巨頭——死了，許多報紙都大書特書地把他生平的事跡登了一遍。他是怎樣致富的呢？</p>
<p>他起初是一個工人·靠做工積一點錢，他就把那個錢去放債收利息，這樣增加了許多財富，於是就去開了個小小的工廠，靠着工人的血汗，他的工廠就發達了起來，打倒了他人的工廠，合併了他人的工廠，這樣併吞了許多個工廠，於是他就成爲托辣斯巨頭——什麽大王了。</p>
<p>這個致富的故事給我們說明了一個道理：那位什麽大王是靠着吃他人的血——利息，工人的血汁，和其他小資本家的血汗——自己肥大起來的。這正是一幅資本主義的慘酷的剝削的眞實圖畫。</p>
<p>然而，在中國這個半封建的社會，却遼有史慘酷的剝削的制度存在：一個小夥子想　人學一點職業的技術·他必需在平常給「師傅」做許多勞役，而且在學會了之後，還要無條件地給「師傳」做兩三年無酬勞的工作，在年限未滿以前，他是沒有工作的自由的，——這就是所謂「學徒制度一。</p>
<p>那位教授致富捷徑的先生不過是利用一個社會的心理，用致富來招收學徙而已。假使他能够招收到幾百學徒給他無條件的「服務」幾年，他自己倒是吃了幾百人的血　致富了·這種不合理的學徒制度，在抗戰建國的過程中，應該剷除掉的。</p>
<h3>佐藤一等兵的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>—從日本人的自述裏引廣的故事</p>
<p>「呀——那是」，金谷吃驚地回答着，那是可怕的設想啊：你爲什麼忽然這樣問起來呢？</p>
<p>「這思想纏繞我的腦子好久了——你是一點不想到這層嗎？」</p>
<p>金谷兩隻手挿進了軍褲袋裏，聳起了雙肩，帶着憂鬱的聲調說：</p>
<p>「簡直不敢那麽自由的思想呵！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢——怕什麼了嗎？」</p>
<p>「躭憂要因此發神經病呢？」</p>
<p>『但這些思想却是自己要纏繞起來的呵！」佐藤縐緊眉頭說。</p>
<p>金谷嘆了口氣；仰起頭望望天空。</p>
<p>小路的那邊，兩個胸前掛着骨灰的士兵正在山崗子上談論着什麽。</p>
<p>「部隊的補充也是沒有希望的了。」金谷自語着。</p>
<p>「這戰事……」</p>
<p>佐藤的注意一下讓僵臥路旁的中國兵的屍體吸引住了。</p>
<p>「我們的下場也就如此，」他想着，而且卽刻對金谷說出了。</p>
<p>金谷默默地沒有回答，他那高聳的肩頭在微微顫動着。顯然，他是讓情緒的激動騷亂了。</p>
<p>他喃喃着；「我們眞是被犧牲了！要是家裏指着死訊」。……</p>
<p>但金谷的一點沒有引起佐藤的在意，他落入另外思境裏去了。……</p>
<p>他突然這樣對金谷說：『我聽到別的部隊已經有人反戰了，是不是？』</p>
<p>『我也聽到了一些，」</p>
<p>「不知進行怎樣了？」</p>
<p>「這個，長官是禁止得很嚴密的哪』，金谷苦笑了起來：「不過聽說槍斃了不少」。</p>
<p>佐藤於是記憶起來了，三個星期以前，中村部隊駐紮在××縣的時候，他確會聽得別的部隊裏的一個士兵說·那犬早上曾秘密處决了幾十名前綫調囘的土兵。「那大概就是久戰的了，』他猜想着。</p>
<p>「明天我們又要開始戰爭了」，金谷曼傷着說。</p>
<p>「是的，我們也許只活得了今天了。」</p>
<p>佐藤說着，他又掉入深深的憂鬱和悲哀裏去了，他幻想着，彷彿就在他眼前湧起了那麽一道高牆。那道高牆眞是高得很，高高地豎立來起，遮隔了大海，遮隔了大海那邊的故鄉和家庭，遮隔了天空和太陽，他感覺着那道高論是把他和人生隔離開來了，……</p>
<p>千斤的憂鬱和　哀那麽重壓着他的心，佐藤甚至於想拔要槍解决自已了。</p>

<h3>秋風起了</h3>
<p>— 李若川</p>
<p>籬笆，</p>
<p>田園，</p>
<p>曠野，</p>
<p>秋風起了。</p>
<p>處處虫嗚二</p>
<p>二聲　，</p>
<p>苦訴戰爭了一年。</p>
<p>今天，</p>
<p>我們抗戰的兒女，依然地，</p>
<p>穿上征衣，</p>
<p>靜候這嚴肅的號角，</p>
<p>戰爭的前奏，</p>
<p>騁馳於血的原野上，</p>
<p>在白天，</p>
<p>在黑夜，</p>
<p>聽烏啼，</p>
<p>看月落，</p>
<p>凄涼的景象，</p>
<p>憾不動勝利的　念。</p>
<p>與奮的雄心，</p>
<p>在戰　裏，</p>
<p>守過無數的黑夜，</p>
<p>大家期待　，</p>
<p>一個新的黎明。</p>
<p>那時，</p>

<p>落葉，</p>
<p>又是無限的凄凉，</p>
<p>好像翻過一座山，</p>
<p>再來一溪蒼茫無際的煙水。</p>
<p>惟有啊，</p>
<p>明年，</p>
<p>這時節，</p>
<p>在門檻外，</p>
<p>向着每個和平的家庭，</p>
<p>秋風在呼嘯着：</p>
<p>爲生存而戰鬥的兒女，</p>
<p>你們勝利了一週年。</p>
<h3>清除糞污</h3>
<p>— 王劍鳴</p>
<p>抗戰好比是一隻大洪爐，在裏面換得起鍛鍊的成爲精鋼，在裏面挨不起鍛鍊的使成爲渣滓，而渣滓的去處，照例是拉圾堆。</p>
<p>近來全國的注意力皆集中在某氏的行向上，我覺得道實在是一種浪費。對于一件本在預料之中的事情，在他實現的時候，是不應該加以這樣的重視的。這正與渣滓必須被傾到拉圾堆上一樣平常。</p>
<p>有些厚道的人還希望她能够回頭，我以爲這也是多此一舉。過去對他所作的善意勸告，不可謂不多，對他言行的嚴正批判，不可謂未盡佛口婆心之能事，而客觀事實給予他的教訓，也不可謂不豐富，不可謂不殘酷，然而結果終未能將他糾正過來，他依舊自管自的放出謬論，其最後之勢必跌入最污穢的地方，此爲自然之理，一個人到了死硬得不肯自愛的時候，旁人還要寄與厚道的幻想，若非太笨，就是多事！</p>
<p>在抗戰中多個把顯明的鄭孝胥王克敏之流，絕不能說是怎樣大的害事，倒是這些東西隱藏在大行列之中，幹些鬼祟的勾當，那才是莫大的危險哩！卽使是他們只盡着絆脚石的作用，也就要令中華民埃的兒女多流無限的鮮血了。現在能及早去到他應去的地方，那是一個很好的現象。要是還有令我們引爲遺憾的地方，那就是我們一再地不能將王克敏之流的民族敗類于事前置之于法！</p>
<p>如有人担心某氏之去會有什麽惡果，那末最好到垃圾堆上去看看被棄的渣滓：受到人人的踐踏，直至被踐踏得成粉碎！</p>
<p>讓他去到應去的地地方去罷，幹我們的正路要緊。</p>
<h3>元旦佳節</h3>
<p>— 烈軻</p>
<p>陽光從窻邊射進來，室內的燈光，被征服似的，立刻暗淡了下來，混合成一種濃烈的澄黃色的光。</p>
<p>沈太太今天醒得特別早，睜開眼來，才發覺睡在脚限邊的貽珍和貽倫，已跑出了被高。她便披上睡衣，挑下床來，一疊聲地喊着：「娘姨，娘姨」！</p>
<p>「啊！來了。」新從難民升做娘姨的何媽，應着一聲跑上來。</p>
<p>『兩個孩子那兒去了？做好的兩套新服裝，着上身沒有？』</p>
<p>『倒沒有用心看，好像—穿—穿的是—學生裝？』何媽氣急地囘答。</p>
<p>「你——眞昏了頭頸去叫他們上來，好時好日一點體面都不要！』沈太太怒氣冲冲地吩付她說。</p>
<p>何媽趕到馬路邊，把孩子叫回來；打開衣橱，一套套取出一件件替他們穿上忙碌了一陳後，貽倫已換一身筆挺的洋裝，貽珍也在絲絨旗袍的外面，套上了一件鮮豔的絨線衫；沈太太自己也換上一身嶄新的冬裝，她拉着孩子，對準了鏡子，細細地看了一會，她滿意地笑了</p>
<p>「那才對啦，不然，怎能走出去？今天是元旦啊，一九三九年的第一天啊！「</p>
<p>「媽——是不是民國二十八年的第一天』？</p>
<p>「誰記得民國不民國？反正，一九三九年是不錯的—歐，—你媽這一套時裝，眞的「一九四〇年式」呢！」</p>
<p>原來，平日沈醉在麻省牌和說笑聲中的沈太太，差不多散漫到百事勿管，而且過慣一種日夜顚倒的生活，每次，每次，她都興奮着精神，把漫漫的長夜，消磨在雀戰的玩意上。……</p>
<p>近來，她忽然覺得天氣轉寒了，寒暑表裏面的水銀，也天天在降低着度數；連案頭的日曆，也薄薄地剩餘了幾頁，她才驚喜地覺到：晤，—快啊！一年又完了的確，她對飛過去的時光，很有幾分留戀和珍惜的意思；但她一想到另外一種意念時，她又嘻着嘴說了：</p>
<p>「倒霉的年頭，快點過去罷，明年一定可以順利點，賭起　來，至少可以不賠本吧？』</p>
<p>月底邊的最末一天，她打發何媽到學校中去，把貽珍和貽倫，接囘家來。</p>
<p>今天是元旦，也就是沈太太心目中最順利的年頭的第一天，她對這樣一個一年一度的良晨和美景，自然有一團說不出的高興，除了在衣着上有顯著的攷究外，吃局也預備來一下「完美的大嚼」，連上下室內，也都整理得很入眼；她畢竟還是一個好勝的人，她想趁兒子女兒在面前的時候，協助她趕辦幾件事；第一件事是侖令貽倫將一本舊日曆取過來，一頁一頁地倒翻過去，細心地檢閱着空白的背面，遇到有寫出「張家小姐欠十元」，「錢師母欠八元」『曹太太短少五元』……等帳目時，便可囑着貽珍一筆筆的摘出來，…化了半小時的時朋，總算把這片糊塗帳理好了，接着，她便開始第二件工作，想和多時不接談的兒女們談談心；</p>
<p>『貽珍，一瞬眼你要華業了；我看不必再升學哩—這亂世，還是住在家裏帮帮雜務地好！』</p>
<p>誰高興，爸爸不是來信准許了我嗎？所以，我决定囘國參加抗戰工作去—」十六歲的女兒，倔强地回答。「嘿——這麽大，還老不聽話，—給你舒適不稱心，你偏要活活作死去—話沒有說完，她又緊接着用一種改悔的口吻說：「唉！昏了頭頸，好時好日的，說出這種不吉利的話，唉！忘記了是元旦；—該打，該打，屁話，屁話！」末後，還吐出兩口濃濃的涏沬。</p>
<p>「而且，爸爸信上說，叫你以後不能再打牌，了說，在國難期間，打牌是一件最惡，最壞，最毒害抗戰的事件，斥貽珍拈出丁另一條途徑指作她！</p>
<p>「誰來聽老精塗的屁話，……開口國難當頭」，閉口「民族生存」，那麼騙人話，聽了也肉麻—好—怪我打麻將，所以把錢按住不肯匯，好！……」</p>
<p>「爸爸的主張很有理，媽媽把錢浪化掉，當然欠通理』好，冷不防十二歲兒子，也頂上來一句。</p>
<p>「好說，浪化錢—你們兩個呢？…上星期何媽送給你倆的十元錢，快快交出來」！</p>
<p>『哈哈—捐給學校裏做了「一元運動去了」</p>
<p>「嘿，——原釆你們變得這樣綽闊了』</p>
<p>沈太太滿腔的高興，却被兩個孩子的胡鬧趕散了，心裏很氣憤，孩子還遺沒有成人，竟敢一搭一擋的這麽盛氣凌　地指斥母親了！』想到這裏，心一氣，便有幾顆熱辣辣的淚珠，從臉上掉下來，一顆顆都落在「一九四〇年式」的冬裝上！</p>
<p>窗外忽然傳來幾陣騷擾的聲浪，沈太太又一疊聲地喊着：「娘姨，娘姨」！</p>
<p>「奧！來了」，何媽應着一聲跑上來，臉上堆滿　嘻笑，但她瞥見太太有一般含淚的怒容時，隨即也把臉孔鬱陰了下來！</p>
<p>「姨娘，好時好日的，誰在門前吵架呀』！</p>
<p>「那——那是隔璧幾家的店夥們，結着伴去献—献什麽「一元運動」去；——歐！太太！我也捐了一元呢」！</p>
<p>「唔——」太太沒有說什麼；他看一看站在身邊孩子的臉頰上却飛上一種勝利的微笑。</p>

<h3>星洲中華足球隊　三月初來港比賽　在港比賽三場日程已定</h3>

<p>游擊隊中的主幹李惠堂氏、因足部傷口、仍未痊愈、昨天扶杖蒞場、祗作壁上觀、隊裏失却那位指揮官、戰鬥力未免减少了、可是退隱已久的英姐（林玉英）和吳錦泉還有很佳的表演，氣力也頗充足、再次下　、仍有可爲也、　（正規軍）</p>

<h3>銀牌又一幕劇戰　聖約瑟淘汰海軍　比路度出擊造成三比二勝利</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天還　新年假期、球城裏有戰事多起、聖約瑟對海軍那幕特別銀牌甲組足球賽、乃在海軍場舉行、</p>
<p>約瑟自得大告山奴、比路度、雷米　等復爲効力、軍威大振、昨天銀牌賽遇着海軍、誰都料定有劇戰、故而蒞塲觀戰的中西球迷、有一二千人之譜、</p>
<p>此囘約瑟得勝、全在善於利用兩翼爲前驅、所得　敲側擊的機會很多、所以、雖然先負兩球、　因兩　發揮得宣及三　　刺有力、拍回和局後、再增加一隻、以三比二淘汝海軍、</p>
<p>大告初任中鋒、但他是息近視的、因日光刺目、不久便改使右內　、而演出亦未見好　、惟衝刺很兇、足使海軍守將望而生畏、</p>
<p>比路度善出擊，故有第三球的獲得、而具居中輸送工夫已恢復原來本色、前線能得時時活動、多賴他的功勞、</p>
<p>馬癸士除所失二球外、遇着更險的來球不過三次、此足證明守衛方面、甚爲堅固、吳德榮、雷米迪及憂仙都有很好的貢獻、</p>
<p>海軍被淘汰、並非技栩不如人的失敗、是捉不情機會的失　、其前線所得進展的數次、比約瑟並未會少過、而且快捷、在下半時岩士當及懇地各一次迫近球門而射、卒被馬癸士所救出、這顯明的弱點、乃　門沒把握</p>
<p>戰時附形、甚爲緊張、開始不久、海軍中鋒鍾十、賺穌過沙的防線、打中一　、先開紀錄、一貶眼、鍾士又來犯、乘着空隙、再破一關、一般人見海軍勝球如此易易、都以爲這塲勝利必屬於海軍的可無疑了、</p>
<p>怎樣得戰　至多變化、約悲志在牧復失地，反攻甚急、不五分鐘、由李安納及大告各獲一球、打成平手、計雙方一得一失、不够十五分鐘、眞神速之至、</p>
<p>下半時　戰、互爲守攻、局面緊　、海軍攻勢雖不弱、但捉不着機會、又失諸臨門最後一脚、故無再獲、</p>
<p>後來約瑟則捉着機會、比路度趁加士地路開來角球、一舉命中、造成三比二的勝利之局，（太　）</p>

<h3>兩場球事　由年尾說到年頭</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】民二十八年的最後一天、南華南與九龍會作特別銀牌甲組足球賽於九龍會場、惟因這個場地素不利於客隊、尤不利於素擅短傅的南南、所以，南南的技術與實力、雖然超出對方、無奈任　個塲地終感施展不來、沒法制隊、七十分鐘的正式時間賽完、猶未分勝負、乃延長二十分錡、也無得失、以零比零結束此戰、他日須來一次重賽、</p>
<p>南南進攻戰略上的優點、乃在純熟與妙美的短　、惟此次不能够取勝、短傳過多是無可否認的弊端、須知道、兵無常　、水無常形、戰時制勝之法、變化多端、足球亦同此理論、南南的前線、在那狹小塲地比賽，仍死靠「獨沽一味」的短傳、不知因時制宜、以致優點適成弱點、被九龍實行密集防衛　所擊破、徒勞無功、由此可以證明、力的發揮、終不及腦的運用、南南諸　對於地勢與戰略、在事前實未曾想　、在戰時遂不會見機行事、</p>
<p>雖然可以原諒的、諸　因爲射門沒把握、必須短　深入而後取、但這個場地、已不容許他們短傳、就得另尋出路才是、無如他們未得隨機應變、反覆短傳、必致球兒被對方奪去而後已、故雖常佔攻勢、卒無效果、直至延長時間比賽、他們才稍變戰略、多採兩翼側和法、惟九龍是『地頭蛇』、効利表演又特別出色、堅守他的『閉關政策』、南南諸鋒奠奈之何、</p>
<p>下回重賽、將在加路連中、南南諸鋒在自己的場地、當可施展如意、到時勝利相信終是南南的、而且、還多得一筆門券收入、兩家均分、此是戰和以後的額外利益、</p>
<p>元日日、南華華則與東方戰於加山、亦是銀牌賽、</p>
<p>此賽在開始後十餘分鐘內、尚有精彩、以後則不成樣子、犯規之多、不可數計、「本是同根生、相煎何太急、」吾欲無言矣、</p>
<p>光榮之敗、好過不義之勝、此囘兩隊還是戰成和局、可毋庸冉論是是非非、但我覺得、假如此賽的裁判員不是柴九皋而是洋人、或不會弄出這很糟的局面、</p>
<p>我得先聲明一句、葉氏在此賽中、處判極　明、眼光够　銳、並無半點錯誤發生、祇因他是華人、雙方球員對他的尊重心、不比對洋人那麼覺得可長、故此葉氏對於雙方球員雖無論誰一演出過火的舉動、便卽嗚笛示罰、但他們總不畏懼、視作等閒、一犯再犯、甚至有被示罰四五次之多者，受葉氏當面、告的亦有五六人、無奈他們絕不知改、被示罰之後、故態復萌、卒有李　友被判離塲的事件、</p>
<p>雙方球員不尊重　氏、卽不尊重自己人、　得葉氏執法如山、處置得當、但他們總唬葉氏爲「本地羗不辣」、此種壞心理、自　人格、對不住　氏、對不住觀衆</p>
<p>全賽過程、南華先勝二球、（一是陳德　單刀直入射中的、一是李碩友主踢自由球射入的），後因林德　受傷、、攻守都受影響、遂被東方力攻、陷於苦戰、乃卒由李德奇在上半時奪回一　、下半時情形很壞，幾乎球兒與人一接觸、便因爭奪而犯規、被示罰、但東方全軍無損、攻勢至盛、再由德奇在混亂中撥入一球、打成平手、旣完七十分鐘、二比　未分輸贏、長時間比賽、再無紀錄、而李碩友則在加時之內被罰離場的、</p>
<p>且待他日重　、勝利誰屬、但願得毋再弄出這次那樣糟、（球塲太歲）</p>
<h3>香港會苦戰敗績　二比三被警察會淘汰</h3>
<p>【本報特訊】昨天特別銀牌甲組賽、香港會對警察會那一幕、在香港會塲碰頭、以實力言、本屬工力悉敵、半斤八兩、在理非經劇戰、未易解决勝負、惟昨賽結果、香港會陣容凌亂、好手如　福「肥史」等均缺席、削弱作戰力、上半場雖以二比二戰成和局、但迨延長時間比賽後、香港會諸將後勁不繼、全軍疲倦，遂以一比三的成績、遭警察會淘汰出局、</p>
<p>是役、戰情混亂、無精彩可言、警察會實力較强、故能控制全局、惟前鋒缺乏穿楊妙技、是以無法穩操勝利、後衛改用柏架担任、球　已非昔比、位置失宜、常予阜拉衝刺機會、其餘四華將中規中矩、舉動文明、</p>
<p>香港會因好手不齊、削弱實力、自當不敵警察、但上半　尚先勝兩球、倒算難能、而全軍亦各盡厥聯、昨之失敗、實力誠不如人、非戰罪之也、</p>
<p>乙組無戰事、甲組依時開始、香港會乘順風佈陣、警察會逆風抵抗、倍覺吃力、球來球往、不離中塲、五分鐘後、阜拉衝開血路、傳交江興、沿邊切入、衣史杜蘭走前接應、隨便踢去、球乘風勢、在門前降落、恰彈着門柱、跌入網窩、埃健士未及關防、搶救無及、一比零杳港會先開紀錄、警察會意外失守後、情有不甘、　起追擊、麽士領導三軍、長　直進、候律兩度運用頭攻、爲高路士閉門謝客、拒過網後、江興開來角球、又爲士堅拿大脚勾銷、無隙問津</p>
<p>未幾、派路奇兵突出、大脚傳中、阜拉如豕突狼奔、衝破重圍、挨健士出迎爲時已晚、阜拉兵臨城下、對門猛射、再建一功、上半場成二比零、香港會佔先、</p>
<p>易地再戰，警察會順風、反佔優勢、前鋒句圍敵門、水洩不通、香港會後衛負隅力反、　經掙托、暫　織眉之急、惟久攻之下、奔走徒勞、氣力不繼、花利亞乘此　　、接一連二、射進兩球、搶囘平手、完塲時二比二和局，</p>
<p>加時再　、香港會諸將、因在先努力作戰、都呈疲態、銳氣消失、遂爲警察會所乘、控制全局、結果、由黃文貴打入一球、以三比二之成績淘汰香港會、陣勢如下、　（固本）</p>

<p>Drums</p>
<p>一張英國亞歷山大柯達空前的出品、劇本故事是王子亞辛姆（薩菩）、爲報殺父之仇、及瑪喬　無竟的救了他生命之後，於是就在戈爾親王密謀大舉的時候、亞辛姆不惜去向總督報告這「叛變」的秘密、　更擊鼓爲助、待援軍開到、殲滅叛亂，</p>
<p>在演出上有二幕戲很可取、在聖節會塲、宮中止興高彩烈的慶祝、能一面又佈　起事的暗綫、直到鼓聲開始、接着又是一個高潮、援軍開到、雙方混戰、在那設備完善過外國，攝得非常生動自然、是很容易的事、幾個戰爭場面、很庇刺激觀觀衆、外景很可能、更因　五彩、所以顯得非常美麗、</p>
<p>演員方面、『薩菩』在『伏象神童』裏可愛的表演技、這裏仍是很出色、女主角范麗立霍遜是個很美麗而會洵戲的英國明星、我若爲王襲片家兼導演佛蘭克勞以前的出品、像「百戰忠魂」、「叛艦喋血記」等、都是銀幕上優秀成功的作品、留給觀衆們個難以磨滅的良好印象、他這近作「我若爲王」、照批評界的批評、在無論那一方面、較之上舉的幾部、是更進一步的成功的、</p>
<p>故事背景，是法三路易十一時代、外有强敵內有飢民的巴黎、中心人物是一個詩人而兼劍客的流氓、他在暴亂的羣衆中、是一個傑出而居領袖地位的人物、無意中殺了路易的一個敵人、路易因他同時口出大言、便給他全權撑理國政一星期的賞賜、在針期限中他得把强敵趕出國土之外、若不然則將受相當刑罰、憑着他的勇敢與才能、經過絕大的奮鬥與努力、他卒戰勝强敵、幷贏得了公主的芳心、</p>
<p>全片演出、偉麗堂皇、各人物也皆活躍有生氮、主要演昌中、節路易的Basll　Rothborn是值得特別讃賞的、導演沒把本片處理得很嚴肅、全片到處部盈溢着幽默諧趣的氣氛、故事本身有着動人的力量、要加上導演的賣力、演技的優秀、劇情的熱鬧、武藝的高超、服裝佈景的典給，成功了這一部無可批評的作品、</p>
<p>東方……狂風暴雨</p>

<h3>抗戰與體育</h3>
<p>— 李惠</p>
<p>幾個月前、大畢烈顚國的體育領袖、曾聯衡發出通電遍告國內民衆、高呼『擴充軍備不如從體育途徑增善國民道德精神」的口號，當時英皇喬治六世、因極端贊美其事、曾在播音台上發出精確的言論、他說、「每一個國　如能循體育的正途來正心健身、則由偭人而使社會組織健全、淸除貪婪畏縮、猜忌自私、怠情殘酷的種種毛病、進而使國家更趨强健、生命永不消　、』最近、納粹主義底德意志、也脚踏實地高唱「國防體育化』論調、立規厲行、强迫實施、使由體育　鍊、以發揚其大日耳曼的精神、</p>
<p>無疑的、時至今日、誰也明瞭體育事業、對人生迫對社會國家、都有非常的關係、體育簡直是人的心房、要時時的跳動着、一刻也不能停息、體育最犬的優點的、</p>
<p>（一）鍛鍊强健體魄</p>
<p>（二）提倡服從美德</p>
<p>（三）鼓勵團結精神除了上述的　大點外、體育的可以、一、提高民族意識、　培養愛國熱忱、三灌輸　牲神神、四　養高上品格、五、養成正義與尚武觀念、所以在近世體育中、我們如果要測度一國的强弱、差不多可以估量他體育成績的優劣、來作相當把握的標準，在今日國難深重，國勢危的當中來談體育、表面上似乎很不合時宣、很多人會說「體育事業是百年大計、如今火燄已燒上眉梢、還那有空間顧慮得到』、不錯，今日全面抗戰期中、兵力、財力、軍實、似乎是比較上最急切需要的東西、不過、如果我們有長　抗戰的大决心、則無論治標治本、或急或緩、我以爲體育事業更應加倍注意、不容片刻忽視的、試問、如果國家無健全的組織、何能抗戰到底、個人方面、如無强健的體魄、何能任中致逮、健全的組織和强健的體魄、惟循體育的正途去覓取才有把握、不能倖致得來的、托爾斯泰說得好、「祗有在肉體勞動中、才能得到健康、才能促進人類的相互團結」、</p>
<p>筆者忝屬體育界一小小份子、抗戰以還、愧無軍事及救護等等學識、及其他專門長才、在前方固無我的踪跡、就是在後方、也因種種環境的關係、愧不能多効棉的於國家、不能多幹點有益抗戰的工作使我惶悚萬分、汗顏無地、我想很多身處後方的體育同志們、也會有同樣的感覺、同樣的苦衷、同樣的飲恨、據我所知的，因爲體育界根本上和軍隊有關係的人不多、所以這次抗戰中、殺身成仁的也很少、體育界多靑年强健之十、在這危亡之　、仍不能在捍衛國家的工作方面、多事實献、也可算是奇恥大辱、捫心有愧、　（未完）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>汪精衛叛國後</h3>
<p>汪精衛　國行爲現經完全證實，元旦日下午中央執監委會臨時會議，並曾因注通×求降，遠反紀律，危害黨國，一致决議將汪永遠開除黨籍，增除一切聯務。汪氏以堂堂黨國領袖而竟自甘墜落至於民族叛徒之列，誠屬國家民族之恥，然而中央這一處置又足見國家紀律嚴明，政治空前進步，今後×人漢奸，不再有所依藉，叛徒敗類，不能有所活動、政府威信大張，民族　臻統一，又未始不是二十八年第一個好消息！</p>
<p>綜觀各方可靠消息，汪氏此次叛國行爲，非出偶然。汪氏在離渝之前，會企圖拉攏若干動搖份子控制五中全會；策動反共停戰運動；甚至近衛對華宣言，亦曾先經汪氏過目，然後發表。汪氏離渝之發及出國後，又曾拉攏一部份中委，並圖煽惑若干地方軍串領袖，作爲其今後異動的支持者。但幸我上下一致擁護抗戰，中央當局處置適宜，尤其是川滇軍事領袖深明大義，尊軍國家利益，忠誠擁護中央抗戰，使汪氏一切活動遭受重大打　。現在汪氏竟已於上月廿九日離港赴滬，汪氏此種行動及　主張、無論在國內國外，均未能引起同情響應，且×人方面似亦未能視爲奇貨；除了自己斷送前途，並充分表現出若干民族敗類與腐惡勢力的總崩潰之外，對於中華民族解放前途不但不會發生任何不良影響，而反足爲抗戰前途顧利之徵，已可斷言。</p>
<p>但是汪氐與×奸的陰謀活動却並未中止。聽說，汪氏抵滬後甚至將在×人卵翼之下，公開召集非法的五中全會，與我中央五中全會相對抗，便是一個例子。</p>
<p>現在中央對汪氏已有嚴正的處置，汪氏不再能擅用國民黨名義鼓惑　亂賣國營私，一度混亂的人心亦將從此安定。</p>
<p>我們今後更要提高政治的警覺，一方面希望各地軍事領袖，以深明大義的川滇當局爲模範，竭誠擁護中央政府抗戰到底，堅决反對任何妥協分裂的活動；一方　希望各界同胞，提高民族的自尊心，增加抗戰建國的勝利觀念，鞏固國內的團結，爭取國際的援助。二十八年是不是勝利之年，全看我們這種努力的程度如何！</p>
<h3>反共陣線的估價</h3>
<p>— 世長譯　原文載十二月份亞洲雜誌　作者Wlliam　Henry　Chamberlfm</p>
<p>德意日三國防共協定的眞正重要性是甚麽呢？這問題自從希特勒進入蘇台德區勝利以後，更加爲世人所注意了；而蘇聯和日本今年夏天在張鼓峯的戰事，也更增加這問題的重要性，很少人能够確實的知道那時蘇聯和日本的衝突，是怎樣的近於一次决戰，和平的保全實在是很危急的，當時蘇聯的飛機每大轟炸日本的領土高麗北部這樣繼續了幾天，日軍的抑制和容忍拯救了和平，　是日本的士兵從來沒有「唾面自乾」的教現，任何人可以想像當時蘇聯飛機猛炸日軍陳地，而日軍不准報復，在邊境戰區的日本　官是怎樣的忿恨，新的邊境衝突屢有發生，而不能美滿的求得解决。在這種情形之下，將來的戰爭必定要受到防共協定的影響，反對共產國際協定的義務，和忠實的實行這種義務，對於將來的戰爭是有深切的關係的。</p>
<p>防共協定最初在一九三六年十一月二—五日成立，當時由日本和德國在柏林簽訂，規定德日兩國政府互相通知關於共產國際活動的情形，商討必要的防禦步驟，和實行這種步　的密切合作：共同議定採取緊念的方法，對付國內外直接的和間接的帮助共產國際　行活動的人們、並且邀請其他國家參加這協定，大約在一年後，意大利也參加這協定了。這是很明顯的，防共協定的內在涵義，比它所發表的內容更爲重要，至於若干方面人十臆測這協定有向蘇　作戰，和分裂遠東爲德日的勢力範圍的規定，我想是不大準確的。在國際關係中，時勢和機會，此存心的計劃更爲重要，日本和德國還不至於在某種指定的時期內，向蘇聯作戰，我們可以看到防共協定有四點不成文的重要涵義：（一這是「不足「國家的疏他諒解，（二）這是某種觀念方面同情的証明書，（三）這是對於共產國際的「人民陣線」戰略的反射，（四）這是將來共同對付蘇聯的種子，尤其是日本和德國，更有這種可能性。</p>
<p>日本和德意兩國一樣，自認是一個沒有嗣業的國家，在世界原料的分配和殖民地市場方面，都受到不公允的待遇，它止在中國探求它這易投資的出路，這同意大利開發阿比西尼亞及在西班牙的行動，和德國努力於攫取多腦河流域的政治，經濟控制權是同樣的情形。假使我們不談　國在華的商業利益，那末日本　德意在遠東方面的利益，實在沒有嚴重的衝突，歐　邊境的移動和歐洲各國的均勢狀態，對於日本並沒有多大興趣，它是一個純粹的亞洲國家，意大利在東方沒有重要的龐大利益，它採取承認「滿洲國」和公開贊成日本在華行動的方式，以爲援助日本，這是和莫索里尼對於英國的政策相符合的，而且莫索里尼相信在這次戰爭中，日本可以得到勝利，所以他想和勝利者方面表示好感，可以保障意大利在遠東方面的利益。這似乎是意日「滿」三國貿易協定的背景，希望這協定能够增進及平　意大利和日「滿」間的貿易，在這協定下所計較的每年總留易額很小，祇有五千四百萬日元，所以這個留易協定的重要性，是屬於政治方面的，增進防共協定簽訂者間的友誼。</p>
<p>德國的傾向於日本或中國的問題是比較複雜，需要較長時間題攷慮，以求解答，德國在歐戰失敗後，喪失了許多殖民地，國外投資和治外法權，它表現出極大的努力和忍耐，在的基礎下建立德國對華的貿易，它不但祗以製造品運入中國，並且使德國廠商積極的貢献中國，達到工業自給的某種程度，德國的金屬品和化學品，在中國市塲暢銷，德國的技術專家，帮助中國創設新工廠，一九三五年德國已奪得英國的地位，佔外國對　貿易的第三位，而與第一位的美國和第二位的日本，緊緊相隨，中國的軍自國運到的極多，並且有德籍軍官團（領袖爲福根霍森將車）相助，訓練中國的幹部軍事人才，和貢南代戰術近的寶貴知識，因爲這種情形的存在，我們可以看到德國在中日戰爭第一年的遠東政策是兩方面的，一方面是防共協定和德國對日的　額及有利的貿易，另一方面是德國劉華貿易的鉅額利益，和維待將來中德友誼的願望，而且福根霍森將軍和其同僚不約離職，認爲在華服務是一種榮譽，尤其是當中國有戰事的時候，而服務合同也未滿期，這兩力面的力量，曾經有一個時期，差不多完全相等，但是德國軍官的繼續在華服務，發生一種最不得當的情勢，因爲　日是防共協定的同盟國，關係非常密切，日本從未譴責　國，而對於　聯央沙諸國的助華攻擊極烈，但是事實上　國軍事專家實爲中國最有利的外國方面援助，「造於德國」的軍火也大量的運華，經香港而入於華軍的手中，知道這種情形的日人，都　示非常忿恨，日本派到　國的外交人員，也表示激烈的不滿，本年春天及初夏，德國表示漸漸的傾向於日本方面，派遺前　日軍事參貨奧脫替代狄克森傳士爲德國駐日大使，奧脫是努力於訂立防共協定的人，同情於中國的德國駐華大使陶德曼，也被召返國，股重要的，福根霍森將軍及其大部分同僚也被召囘柏林，德政府並且保証減少運華軍火，假使不是完全停止軍火運華，德國這樣的改變遠東政策是有理由的，最重要的理由是希特勒想以日本爲德國的同盟國，共同對付蘇聯，而且日本佔領了中國重要的沿海商埠以後，德國的對華留易大受影響，德國更想採取親日的政策，可以在『滿洲國」和日本佔領區內獲得若干利益，雖然有知的德國人對於這些是不抱奢望的。</p>
<p>世人時常預料蘇日戰爭，而　戰爭終是延遲　，到現在還沒有發生，日蘇戰爭究竟是甚麽一回事呢？無疑的這種戰爭最後必爲一種大規模的激烈衝突，兩個　相猜疑和怨恨的國家，時常發生邊境問題的爭議，各在邊疆建桀鞏固的防禦工事，除邊境問題外，蘇日兩國還有基他方面的困難和惡感，例如　約的爭議，北薩克林日本煤沖和煤的爭議，和兩國防止對方間諜活動的種種步驟等，放遠眼光看起來，蘇日兩國能够長久的維持和平的希望是並不光明的，但是在近視的觀察下，現在的裝和平狀態，時常有一事件」發生，此種　狀也許能够繼續維持相當長久的時期，很明顯的雙方　有抑制戰爭的理由，現在日本有軍隊百萬和無數軍火在中國各地，在　個時候即使最瘋狂的軍閥也不會歡迎相蘇聯作戰的，蘇聯也是不歡迎這時和日本作戰，因爲它國　的淸黨運動，繼續不斷的淮行，喪失許多能幹的紅軍高級長官，而且歐洲情勢仍舊沒有穩定，蘇聯也不願輕的有所舉動，在這種情形下，日本已經得到防共協定的援助了，因爲歐洲的德國已經使蘇聯在歐洲部分的大批軍隊留駐歐洲假使日德沒有防共協定的關係，蘇聯可以調動歐洲的其軍隊到還東的。</p>
<p>假使到了蘇聯或日本認爲本身的實力足以應付對方的時候，　者就在　事的邊　發生攻擊，這第二次日俄戰爭的危險是極大的，　日蘇兩國爭　東亞霸權的大的大　，假使日本在這久戰爭中　得勝利，那沒它在亞洲大陸得勢力當然史爲堅固安令的到大　的盟主商位以後的它　可以挑戰英　的海權，當然蘇聯如果失敗，也可以削弱國　抗戰意志，假　蘇聯　得勝利也發生非常重要的結果，日不不　要　失地方來在中國佔領的士　，並且要失去滿洲　高　　，更可以引架它國內革命的　　，同樣的假使蘇聯失敗，史太林的獨裁必定推翻，雖然整個蘇聯的行政統治也許仍能繼續存在，無可漿惑的，兩個國家對於引起可能的戰爭都是非常謹愼攷慮的，</p>
<p>蘇聯和日本兩國開戰後，那一國可以獲得勝利呢？大文豪　爾斯泰曾經說在戰　中，機會與　然往往較最週密的計劃爲重要，還句話對科學發達後的現代戰爭　更爲　合，預測蘇日爭戰的勝利者，因爲國際情勢的複雜和德定。更　　困難不少。不意今在歐洲打擊蘇聯嗎？法國會帮助蘇聯對付　會嗎？　美的態度怎樣？這種種都是非常繁複的問題，我們在所能說的祗是指出蘇聯　日本在戰時所能得到的長見或優點，那一方面長處是較爲有利，可以獲勝，唯有靜候日後歷史的解答。蘇聯在戰時的長處有：（一）飛機坦克串和一切機械化的武器都比較日本優良（二）工業中心點相人口集中的地方都日較日本的—業中心點和人口集中地不易受到空襲（三）資源　富，每年煤鋼鐵的產量比日本大三倍，並且還可以擴展，蘇聯的人力也　較日本多外倍餘，（四）蘇聯不像日本仍舊要設法控制滿洲國」和華北許多　有完　和平的地方，日本在戰時的長處有：（一）日本距離戰區較近，「滿洲國」和高麗的鐵道運輸比較四伯利亞單軌鐵路的運輸迅速而有利。（二）據曾在蘇聯和日本工作的外國工程師的意見，日本的工業效率比蘇聯的爲高。（三）日本的統一和作戰精神很是良好，因爲日本是同類同質的民族，很少有外國血統，更沒有少數民族問題。</p>
<p>防　協定的將來重要性是依歐亞兩洲大勢的發展而定，就是歐洲和亞洲將漸的綏靖而達到和平呢？還是擴大現在爭鬥的區域呢？假使　西班牙和中國進行的戰爭漸漸的　止，在歐洲和遠東建立了某種的新平衡狀態，那末防共協定不過是一件柏拉圖式的事件，互相交發表　言相信息，表示友　罷了，這協定也沒有經濟上的價值，　意能援助日本開發其佔領區的也極爲有限，但是，假使現在歐洲和亞洲有傾向於大戰的趨勢。而現在在中國和西班牙進行的戰爭不過是新的世界大戰的前導，那末防共協定或許能變爲歷史上可以注目的一个協定。（完）</p>

<h3>論抗戰建國中的建設事業</h3>
<p>— 陳誠</p>
<p>本文　去年十月十七日，在表陽前綫，對幹訓團學生之　　辭，意在說明抗戰爲手段，建國為目的，故目前的戰爭，不過爲達成國民革命建國目的之一種手段。找們爲了爭取戰爭的勝利，要加強抗戰力量，就得一面作戰，一面從事建設，尤其是積極的國助建設然，後才能提早完成根苦的抗戰工作。今當新年歲首，民族復興史又展開了　的一頁，正是吾人策勵自省，加緊動員工作，努力後方建設之日，語云：「一年之計在於春」，用　提出　　的建設問題，以爲元旦獻辭，藉供國人今後致力建設之參考，使建設與革事相配合，抗戰與建國同時並行，則三民主義新中國之偉業，當可拭目而告厥成也！</p>
<p>陳誠謹誌</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>（一）建設的意義。（二）建設的內容。（三）民生問題與民生建設。（四）生產建設與國防建設。（五）建設的統一統制與管理。（六）建設與教育</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>在我們艱苦抗戰期。許爲多人建設問對　，中　注意　這是個題好現象，但在他們討論中却發生許多爭執，各是其是，莫衷　是，這種情形，直接間接都减　丁建設的力量，影響抗戰的前途，所以今天把我個人對這間的意見提出來和大家研究。</p>
<p>據我看大家所　生的爭論，多半是由子研究原則　的請誤，所以在未入本題以前，我先要把研究社會問題的基本原則說一說：</p>
<p>社會是毫不悴留的向前發展的。社會上人與人的　　，是一天比一天密切的。這種相　關係結合起來，構成爲社會總體，所以整個社會直接間接都是彼此聯銷起來的。如中日戰爭。可以直接影響世界各國的經濟和金融市塲，間接影響到各地物價，以至彩響到各个人的日常生活，這好像在池塘水面擲進一塊石頭他的波汶可以逐激波及到水面的全體。雖然，因遠近之　波汶有大小之別，但是總不能不受影饗的，這是甚麽原因？就是因爲水面是整個的，水的每僩分子都彼此聯繫結合着的。社會更是這樣；所以我們研究任何一個社會問題，都不能忘掉各方面的關係，片面的部分的孤立的研究，終不易得到正確的結論。比如就軍隊來說，必須高級長官中級軍官下級士兵以至武器裝備，都有適當健全的組織配合，才能發揮很大的作戰效能。任何一部分的欠缺，都足以影響戰鬥力量的，在這次抗戰中，一般人都知道高級將領的重要，其實士兵又何嘗不是站在同等重要的地位呢？不過各自担任的職務不同罷了，猶如五官四肢之於人身，缺一不可，明白這个道理，以後賣辣椒的便不必說醋也是辣的；賣醋的更不必强爭辣椒也是酸的了。</p>
<p>其次，要知道社會是導續發展的，社會從沒有一天死亡過，因而他的發展也從沒有一天間斷過，這樣整个人類社會發展的歷史，構成了極錯綜複雜的因果關係—好像沒有昨天，便沒有今天，有了今天，一定還要有个明天，今天的資本主義社曾，是從封建社會母胎裏產生出來的，同時由于今天資本主義社會內部的許多矛盾，將來又必然要產生個大同社會，所以總理的世界大同，並不是憑空來的，而是根據歷史的演　客觀的實况產出來的，更顯明點說，由於我國社會落後，引起了日本帝國主義的積極侵略，才造成現在偉大的抗日戰爭，更由于全國一致的努力，才構成最後勝利，民族解放的有力因素：我們從這裏當然更可以這求到中國社會何以落後了日本帝國主義何以必須向外侵略了，這些問題，說起來雖然話長，但這種方法，原則，確是解决問題的不二法門，所謂『物有本末』，就是這个道理。假如割勸了前後來研究，不尋索其來源及發展前途，結果不過是知其一不其知其二罷了？</p>
<p>（一）建設的意義</p>
<p>人類社會在進化過程中，常常包含着兩種相反的成分。某些人代表全社會利益，幫助社會向前發展，某些人爲了個人利益，不惜妨害了　體利益，而阻止了社會的發展，甚至拉着社會後退。革命的意義，是要　進　會向前進展，以謀全體人類之幸福與安樂。　是說，要向合理的社會邁進。爲了達到這種目的。革命便須採取兩種必要方法，一方面對阻碍社會進步的反動力量和設施，必須盡量破　，以造成建設的順利條件，保証革命的迅速發展；另一方面，對新社會的種種要求，必須努力建設，以鞏固革命的眞實基礎　淸破壤革命的反動勢力，達到革命的眞正目的，所以建設與破壞在革命意義上來講，是站在同等重要的地位，而一般人多注重破壞，往往忽略了建設，這是莫大的錯誤，我們可以還看十三年建國大綱宣言中「建國大網者，以掃除障碍爲始，完成建設爲依歸，夫革命爲非常之破壞故不可無非常之建設以繼之」。早已指定了建設在革命中的重要性。總理爲求中國社會向前進展，以偉大　神領導革命，對阻滯革命前進腐敗不堪的滿淸政權與專制政體，作前後十餘次的劇烈鬥爭，終有辛亥革命的成功。民國以來，更與封建殘餘的北洋軍　决鬥，其用　無非仕運用革命力量，來掃除建設的障碍，以期新社會早日出現，手訂建國大綱等重要方案，就是要建設　中國的証據。總理說：「今後革命當賡續辛亥未完之緒，而力矯其矢。卽今後革命，不但用力破壞，尤當用力建設。」可見其對建設之注視。領袖機總理遺志，領導革命，造成歷史僅有的統一局面，而努力種種建設工作。最近更發動全國人力物力與阻碍我國家獨　民族生存之日本帝國主義作殊死戰，然在七七事變後，就在廬山提出了「建國運動』的口號，指明了建設國家的道路，臨時代表大會宣言中，亦謂：一吾人當竭其全力為國家民族爭取生存與獨立，同時根據　民主羲，繼續不斷完成政治上經濟上之建設，俾中國得自由平等於世界。」又謂：「蓋非抗戰，則民族之生存獨，且不可保，自無以遂建國大業之進行。而非建國，則自力不能充實，將何以捍禦外侮，以求最後之勝利。「所以今天的抗戰，意卽抵制侵略　除設建新中國的障碍，和從前的　翻滿淸，打倒軍閥，肅淸封建殘餘，完全是同一意義。</p>
<p>其次，反動勢力也往往藉口建設、麻醉國人，以達其破壞革命，目的。遠如張動復辟，袁世　稱帝，近如日寇之製造傀儡政權，都是這樣。我們要知道，建設必須要站在革命旗　下，才有進步的意義，反革命的建設，不過是製造反動局面，使社會永遠停留在不合理的狀態下面，日寇之建設傀儡政權，是想使我國永遠陷於殖　地境地，叫我們過牛馬式的奴隸生活，而我們的建設，恰是要在這種苦海的彼岸建設一個新社會、使中國成一個獨立自由的幸福國家，大家祇要注意到這點，就不致皂白不分，誤入歧途了。</p>
<p>（二）建設的內容</p>
<p>建設三民主義的新中國，是我們革命的總目標，更詳細點說，我們的建設，甚要朝着民挨獨立，民權平等和民生樂利的方向邁進，以達到中國的國際地位平等，政治地位平等，經濟地位平等，使中國水久適存於世界。爲了達到這些目的，總理在建國方略中，就建設的性質，分爲心理建設，物質建設，社會建設三部門，領袖更把總理遺教發揚光大，將總理關於政府組織與地方自治的遺教，歸納爲政治建設，又補充軍事建設爲武力建設，完成了建設的五大部門。</p>
<p>一、心理建設。卽指孫文學設而言。其中所涵精義，是在力闢數千年來知易行難的荒謬學說，因爲這種學說的影響，使全國人民甚至革侖同志，陷于長難而止，不能　信言行的境地，革命精神，喪失殆盡，流幣所及，眞有總理所謂上百倍於滿淸。這種腐朽心理的改變，等於革命靈魂的注入，有了這種革命靈魂，任何强暴的反動勢力，都不會絲毫動撼我們的革命精神了。領袖更將其範圍擴大，發揮「智仁勇」的精神，完成了實際上的精神建設，激揚忠義，發揮正氣，以挽救危亡，復與民族。</p>
<p>二、物質建設，係指　總理的實業計劃而言，實　計劃是　總理最偉大的建設部分，眞正的社會發達，就是人類對自然的更大征服，物質的充分利用，我國地大物博，天然蘊　特別　富，比別人落後的地方，就是沒有開採利用，貨棄於地，良堪借—眞能照</p>
<p>總理的實業計劃實行下去，則經濟發達，民生輪俗，衣食住行問題都可迎刃而解，當然能成爲一個富强安樂的新國家，更應注意的，卽領袖所謂，「實業計劃一部書，其實就是一部偉大的國防計劃」。總理深謀還慮，早爲國家民族策長治久安之道，可惜我們沒有切實奉行，予日寇橫暴侵凌的機會，囘想，來實堪痛心！</p>
<p>三、社會建設，指民權初步而言。表面看來，不過是說明開會形式與秩序而已，實際上它却包含了兩種特殊意義：一「養成國民的組織能力，我們知道機械力量之偉大，因爲它是基終一定的組織配合起來的，假如各部拆散，也不過是些鋼鐵碎片而已。一切都是這樣，何況于人類，我們自稱人口衆多，但要不加以，定的組織，還像過去一盤散沙的去應付敵人，就是再比這多上幾倍，恐怕也不會發生什麽效力，眞能個個國民習於總理的民權初步，養成一種組織習慣，發動全國民眾，膠結四百兆人土爲一體，可說一切都有辦法。二、培養國民運用政權能力。民權主義最後的目的在使人民管理政治實現眞正的民主國家，但如人民沒有管理能力，常被少數人假借濟私，遺害更不堪設想，　總理不單要還政於民。而且教人民來運用政權的方法，可謂仁至義盡了。</p>
<p>四，政治建設，照領袖解釋，是指「普通所謂政治的範圍以內的實際事物，特別是指國家政治機構之建設與運用而言」。意卽健全政治機構，使民衆自衛組織健全起來，目前講來便是從改善人民生活動員，一切力量均以軍事做中心，以鞏固我們抗戰中的政治基礎，尤其是對於怠精昏瞶貪婪舞弊的胥吏，更要　底剷除。說到五權憲法，則如領袖所言，「爲政治建設所要建設的理想制度」，也就是政治建設的終極目的。</p>
<p>五，武力建設，卽軍事建設，就是要發展軍　實力，創造國防武力，對內掃除碍，對外保持國家民族的獨立平等，所以這裏所說的武力，是革命的武力，是要担任革命事業的，並不是如軍閥時代，做私人工具用的。我以謂說過，建軍的要旨，就是要使個人的團體的武力，變爲國家的民族的武力，要使　弱的武力，變爲　强的武力，更要使少數的武力，變爲多數的武力，凝結爲一，在領袖統一領導之下，爲民族抗戰，爲主義犧牲，武力建設足了，一切實際的建設才得到了有力保證，尤其在國　軍備競賽，弱肉、强食的今天，武力建設，更感迫切重要。</p>
<p>這裏我們所以把建設的五部門，都加以闡述的原因，就是要使大家知道建設的全體性，不要隨　忽略了一面，成爲畸形的建設。因爲時常有人祗請一民主義，失去　總理三民主義的原意，但同時又忽略了民生主義，在三民主義中的特殊重要地位，這是莫大的危險，以下我們將進而說明這一點。</p>
<p>（三）民生問題興民生建設</p>
<p>『建設之首要在民生』，這是總理留給我們的重要指示—領袖解釋民生建設，在三民主義中的重要性，會謂：「　族主義要扶植國家與民族的獨立，就是要排除民生的障碍，民權主義，要建設人民的權力，就是要使人民自身能解决民生問題一。依照總理的意思，『民生就是人民的生活，社會的生存，國民的生計（也可以說是國家的生計），羣衆（民族）的生命」，甘中頂要　的就是人民的生活，大家顧名思義，也能知道，祗要人民生活得釗適當解决，則社曾生　國　生計，羣眾生命，亦自必迎刃而解，社會上一切問題的發生以及人類歷史上最難解决的問題，就是民生問題是一切問題的根源，也就是被總理極端重視　列爲三民主義的中心問題之唯一原因，我們要奉行總理遺囑，建設一民主義的新社會，也就不得不致力於民生建設，同時一切的建設，都是以民生建設爲主要依歸的。</p>
<p>人類一切經濟的活動，都不外乎衣食住行四大需求，這四大實際生活問題，構成了民生間題的主要內容，充實這些實際需求的來源，當然存在乎于大自然界中，因而人類時刻在謀對自然之征服與利用，以滿足他們的生活要求，所謂落後社會的意思，固然是一切都落後，但主要的還在說明他的生產落後，就是他對自然的征服和利用的力量，比較薄弱，因而他的實　生活要求，便不能得到比較好的滿足。照理講，生產愈發達，社曾愈昌明，人類的實際生活，便愈能得到更大的滿足，所以人類使不必研究其他問題，祇努子如何發達生　完了。但實際上不是這樣，因為社會制度的關係，使生產資本和生　工具，都集中在少數人手裏，不從事勞動，專門剝削他人的剩餘價值，度其豪華奢侈的生活。同時人多數每日辛勤勞作的人，反向不能維持最低限度的生活，形成社會極大的矛盾現象，這樣社會的發展，祇有利於少數人，形成勞力而無食，不勞而食的不合理狀况，直接影響了生產的發達。總琿認濟了中國社會，是個生產落後的社會。欲求人民的住活舒　，非努力促進生產建設不可，同時看淸了先進國家社會發展的弊害，想出了防　　　合理的解决辦法：一，實行平均地　　，以　除社　級中兼併侵削的不平均現象，達到耕者有其田的目　；二，節制資本，主張一方面保陣私人企案，以求生產的迅速發達，同時限制私人資本，不使其　　國民生計以危害大多數人的生活；三，促進勞資合作，消滅因勞資衝突而妨碍生產的毛病，使雙方均在國家民族最高利益下合作，以加緊生產；四，發展國家資本，要使凡不宜於私人經營或私人所不能經營的企業，由國家來經營，中央政府與地方政府的經營權，也根據一定標準來劃分：五，政府人民協力解决生產與分配問題，使社會經濟有一定的軌道與秩序。所以總理的偉大，不單在於努力建設，以解决民生問題，並且注意社會制度的改善，使其不妨碍生產建設，不單注意生產問題，同時更注意分配問題。不單知道先進國家一般矛盾現象，更注意到中國社會的特殊落後性。不單關心現在的問題，還注意預防將來的弊端。領袖更根據總理的基本原則，倡導國民經濟建設運動，作爲民生建設的初步實現，以期達到人盡其材，地盡其利，物盡兵用，事盡其功的偉大目的，進而完成世界大同的最高理想。</p>
<p>（四）和平建設與國防建設</p>
<p>社會不能有一大的死亡或間斷，生產事業也就不能有一天停止間斷了。生產建設的意義，就是凡與人民生活有關，而促進人民生活利益的建設，都可包含進去。所以　一般人更廣汎的稱之爲經濟建設。總理的生產建設大部涵於　　　生建設之中，所以明白了總理的民生建設，則中國生產建設的方針，也就可以大體明白了。我們在這裏助應特別提到的，就是國防建設，不過國防建設，和武力建設，關係雖然密切，但並不相同，前者的範圍，顯然要比後者大的多。凡是與國家民族的存在獨立有關係的建設，統可謂之國防建設，並不是單限于武力建設，但武力設建。確是國防建設中最切要而必需的建設，領袖認武力爲國家生命之一，我們就可以知　他的重要性了。說到國防建設，總理老早就注意到這個問題的。醫如實業計劃之中，就含蓄了很大的國防計劃的意義，如河道海港的開闢，鐵路網的構成，以及煤鐵礦產鍊鋼機械等火工廠的建設，無不是以國防需要作中心的。領袖對軍事人員的訓練，有謂：『我們如果不採實業計劃研究得透澈，就不算曉軍事，更不配談幽防。』可惜十多年來，我們受了特殊環境的限制，以及國人的不大注意，專講民生建設，並且把民生建設看成普通的經濟建設，忽視了軍事方面的重了業，輕了業，以至動力化學等軍需工業的製造，以至戰時車事器村物資用品，都不能達到自給自足的要求，我們如果能曉得國家存在的重要，便更知道國防建設的重要了。在國際界限，仍然有在的現社會中，尤其列强虎視眈眈的今天，國防建設的重要性，確實超出一般生產建設之上，無國防即無國家，無國家還談什麼生產建設呢！老實說，我們今天所以受暴×的無理摧殘，就是由於我們過去無國防的建設，譬如許多工廠，建築在沿江沿海的通都大埠，這次戰爭形勢，沿海都早變爲戰區，我們的工廠工業，于是受了莫大損失，德國研究國防經濟的某專家到中國考察後。曾向我談過中國的交通建設，都是由外向內修築，許多控制點與交通中心，完全便利了敵人對我們的侵略。這話說得很有道理，由此可以証明了我們過去的建設，不但談不到國防建設，而且有害于國防的。假如屆能注意及此，不獨這些損失無從發生，卽今日的戰們武器，亦可充實白倍。我們絕不是不注意一般的生產建設，而是在現階段應該側重國防建設，祗有國防建設的成功，才能　，國民革命對外求國家民　自由平等的任務，保證生產建設的順利發展。到現在，我們已親身嘗過了實際教訓，要是還死守一般生產建設老調而不變，眞有點不明輕重緩急了。</p>
<p>再有國防建設與各生產部門的相互關係，我已說過社會是整個的，因而生產事業，也不曾孤立來進行，所謂國防建設，是以國防爲中心的意思，並不是忽略其他一切建設的意思，凡與國防建設有關的各生產部門也必須建立起來，要做到一切爲了國防的旨。趣例如有關軍事的生產，多半是重工業，但其主要原料爲煤鐵，於是又牽連到發展礦業方面去了，製造火藥，必須棉花，結果又捲入農業生產的範　了，對于這些，若不同時並進，國防建設仍然不能成功。</p>
<p>（五）建設的統一制與管理</p>
<p>在今天資本社社會主義裏，生產關係已把全世界變成一體了。各國的生產建設，都力求統一，以堆進其生產效率，封建時代的產方式，已經不適用於今天了，過去有些省份，不能運照全國的統一辦法來推行建設，乃另外形成獨個系統，各自建設，提倡本省土貨，抵制外省國貨，使國貨緒小流通範圍，根本遠犯了總理貨暢具　的原則，實行單獨一省的關係主義，　不得生產之整個聯繫性，比如就全國範圍言，因天然地勢與人工原料的方便，某些地方適宜於建設重工業，某地又因特殊關係適宜建設輕工業，國家對於某種實物需要特別多，必須大量生產，某種貨物生產必須限制到一定的數量，這樣把全國適當的分配來建設，並統計全國生產數量與原料的分佈狀况，使各生產部門都能有一定聯繫與適當的發展，無過剩不足之感，來推動全國的建設事業，這樣全國大分工大合作的結果，一定能得到意外的成功。但是這必須有個全圖統一局面和整個計劃系統，才能達到這種目的。要知道各地方關門建設，是種最不經濟的事情，因爲假如全國各省都實行各自建設，便形成了二十幾個建設單位，致使不適宜生產的東西，也得生產，適宜生產的東西，反不能暢流進行，把許多精力物力，都自相抵消了，那有不失敗的道理呢？</p>
<p>統一統制和管理，是相連的東西，有了統一之後，才能談到統制和管理。普通所說統制大半，是指國家政府的管理力量而言的，統制生產與建設，是說有一定計劃，一定步驟的生產　建設，反對盲目的生產建設，使生產與建設在預定目的下面，合理進行，不使有絲亳的浪費消耗。我們由此可以看到統制的唯』前提，便是統一，有了統一之後，便須緊接着來實行統制，使全國的建設事業，很經濟的來進行。例如各國的工業界，無論機械，甚至螺旋釘，都是全國一致的，祗要是同號大小的螺旋，無論是機器或砲軍，都可使用，無形中增加了許多便利，還有些平日製造玩具的工廠，一遇戰時，便能立刻改爲製造軍需品的工廠，這都是任建設時就遵循着一定深奧計劃的結果。和總理寓國防建設於實業計劃中，是一樣的用意。今天在抵抗暴×努力實施國防建設的時候，更應實行統制，在一定的計劃中，來進行建設。</p>
<p>管理的意思，普通係指工廠自身的管理而言，用意在減少浪費，縮小生產成本，以加大製造品的生產效率。歐人台樓爾提供科擊管理，使工廠生產在時別經　的原則下進行，各國工業界于是羣起倣效迄今仍在力求管理的精密。據說日本最大的八幡　廠，爲了　算每日需要多少手紙工廠當局，甚至特別派有專員坐守廁所調查人數，以求適當的供應。我以前參觀山西的建設，對于各部門都有詳細的詢問，結果發現最大的弱點，便是不能實行精確的科學管理，以最經濟的方法，運用人工和原料，使生產成本不能减做到最小限度，以致價格較昂，不能在市塲上戰勝別人。領袖在建國運動中，特別注意到「管一字，認爲將來要達到「事無頹弛，地無　廢，物無遺棄」的目的，非實行嚴密的管理不可。我們現在在艱難困苦中來建國，對于管理、更應特別注意。</p>
<p>六建設與教育</p>
<p>我們剛才說的是以國防建設作中心，進而推行一切的建設事業，以達到整個建國巨大目的，然而這種建設推動力量，主要的還存在於教育方面，領袖認教育爲國家三大生命之一，可見他對于一切事業的重要性，我們現在所說的祇是和建設有直接關係而必須做到的教育事項。</p>
<p>現在的教育，首先屬當注意　員建設心壇的培養。大家知道建設事業是件最偉大的工作，而也贊不是某個人或某部分人所能獨自做到的事，必須利用全國每個人的力量，在分工合作的原則下，來共同進行，就是必須運國總動員來推行建設的意養。頓袖在國民經濟建設全動總結中，說明結集全國鼠民之　誠，聯農工商學兵之全力，以不分彼此之精神，分工協作之方法，向同一目標而努力』，所以我們必須以「智信仁勇」的固有精神，以教育的宣傳力量，使全國人民都了解建設在國家民族中與抗戰是站在同等重要的地位。他和各個人的利害關係，是非常密切；其前途是光明是偉人的。國防建設在目前的特殊意義，是在啓發民族的建設信心，使人們進而堅决的負担國防建設的任務，以完成抗戰建國的巨大目的，這種教育，方能奠定發動民衆的基礎，造成全國建設的緊張空氣，總理「革命先革心」的精神教育，在今天是特別需要的。</p>
<p>其次，是專門技術人才的培養，我國多年教育惡習，便是沒有造就眞正的專門人才，造就的人才，都是些什麽也能幹，什麽也幹不好，這原因自然是由于國家沒有走上建設大道，縱然有點專門人才，多是找不到適當工作，學而無用，以致影響到求學的人，養　了四面光，不願專門研究，有些人縱然找到工作，也由于研究不深，不能勝任愉快，產生時圖他就的心理。同時在學校培餐的時候，就不注重實習，和社會的實際需要，以致養成爲能說不能行，能行不能用的無用人才，再加用人地方，不能採取人才主義，所用的無非是些才非其用的親友，所以求學的人，更不願深造了。這種情形，對國家損失太大了，我們今後旣然要需要專門建設人才，並且要注意培養專門建設人才，則對于上邊的種種隔閡，種種弊端，不能不力爲打破。</p>
<p>中小學教育，也應當極力培養國家觀念，因爲小學生是將來中國的主人翁，將來的革命任務建國人業。完全是在他們肩上的，我們要使他們能負担得起建國的任務，就不能使他們在光陰上零力上有絲毫的浪費。</p>
<p>（七）結論—自力更生</p>
<p>我們旣然來談建設，首先自然要理解建設的全盤意義，和一貫系統，以免頭痛醫頭，足痛醫足，甚至于頭痛醫脚。脚痛醫頭，亂着一起，找不着要領的毛病。不過我雖知道建設是革命的重要內容，民生建設，是一切建設的中心。國防建設，又立于尤其重要的地位，統一計劃管理，又是建設的要點，教育更是建設的主要推動力，然而還有一項，必須遵守的基本原則，爲我國今日特別應注意者就是「自力更生」。</p>
<p>一般的來講，不圖自立，專賴別人的國家，很難久立于世界，阿比西尼亞的慘痛經驗，和捷克的實在教訓，已經很明白的告訴我們了。總理在實業計劃中，談到建設的資本來源，主張吸收外資，但更注意到主權操之我手，並且主張利用國際資本，以防備任何一國優越的經濟勢力，控制我們的命脈，失掉我們的自主能力，領袖更深　說到「我近來提倡國民經　建設運動的宗旨，就在促起國民一致努力，用自己力量來發展生產事業，完成整個國家經濟的建設。這是最有把握的一個途徑。如果自己不努力，單靠人家是决無希望的。……必須以自力求住存，能自强然後能良立』。這種自力更生的道理，已經說的最懇切了。雖然我們國家貧弱，並且遭受到歷史上空前未有之困難境遇，如果我國上下都抱着『自助人助』的信心，發揮我們自身所具有的偉大力量，來「實幹硬幹快幹」，一面抗戰，一面建國，三民主義的新中國的成功實現，一定是爲期不遠的。</p>

<h3>Enhancing Political Work in the Army During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Our War of Resistance Against Japan has transitioned from the first stage to the second. To launch a full-scale war and strive for ultimate victory, strengthening political work in the army is currently the most crucial matter. At present, the central authorities, in addition to restoring political organizations in the army in imitation of the Northern Expedition era, are also training a large number of political workers for deployment. In Guangdong, there is a so-called Political Work Brigade, mobilizing the people to engage in the war of resistance. In Guangxi, male and female young students are also organized to go to various guerrilla areas, following the army and undertaking political work. Elsewhere, such as in Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and various guerrilla areas, efforts are underway to actively promote this. These measures are the driving force for enhancing the army's combat effectiveness and a shortcut to achieving victory.</p>
<p>To accomplish the first task, it is essential to ensure that all officers and soldiers understand the significance and future of this war, recognizing that it is a necessary path in the process of national revolution, a war for survival and independence. All peace-loving countries in the world are therefore expressing sympathy and providing assistance. Judging from the current situation, there is a high degree of certainty of victory in the future. Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate in all officers and soldiers a spirit of perseverance, hard work, and sacrifice for the country. Thirdly, it is necessary for every soldier to consciously observe discipline, trust their commanders, resolutely execute orders, obey commands, promote the spirit of camaraderie within the unit, and consolidate internal unity.</p>
<p>To accomplish the second task, it is necessary to establish close ties between the army and the people. The army must not only refrain from infringing upon the interests of the people, but also, under the premise of resisting the Japanese, find ways to alleviate the suffering of the masses, unite with the people, and become the armed force of the people. At the same time, organize the people and mobilize the people. Only in this way can the closest relationship be maintained with the people.</p>
<p>Based on historical experience, achieving ultimate victory in war cannot rely solely on technology; the most important thing is to have correct policies and gain the support of the people. For example, during the Great Revolution of China from 1925 to 1927, the National Revolutionary Army, with relatively backward equipment, swept away the Fengtian-Zhili warlords and established a foundation for unification in a short period of time. There were many reasons for this rapid success, but one of the important reasons was the establishment of political work in the army and the support of the broad masses of the people. Now that our country is resisting Japanese aggression, in terms of equipment, it is naturally inferior to Japan, just as the National Revolutionary Army was to the armies led by the Fengtian-Zhili warlords. Therefore, to achieve ultimate victory, there is no doubt that we must rely on the power of the broad masses of the people. Not only must we mobilize the broad masses of the people militarily, but we must also mobilize the entire nation politically.</p>
<p>The basic tasks of political work in the army can be divided into three aspects: first, to consolidate the troops and enhance their combat effectiveness; second, to unite countless people to help and assist the army in combat; and third, to politically influence the enemy's internal affairs and disintegrate their army.</p>
<p>To accomplish the third task, it is necessary to awaken the political consciousness of the enemy's lower-level elements and utilize the anti-war sentiments of the enemy's army. Because the enemy's army is either forcibly conscripted from different places and different ethnic groups, or drafted from the masses of farmers and workers of their own country. They are already deeply dissatisfied with the plutocrats and warlords, and it is possible to call on them to organize and oppose the war, thereby promoting the awakening of the Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>In the past, our country's authorities seemed to have paid little attention to political work in the army, especially in various guerrilla areas. Although the people in the guerrilla areas have already suffered from the aggression of the Japanese warlords and are eager to rise up and resist, they not only lack political cultivation, but they are also unable to clearly understand their own environment. How can they organize and help the army in combat? If this behavior is not immediately corrected, how can it be guaranteed that some people will not only fail to see through the deception of the Japanese, but will instead support the aggressors? Fortunately, our country's authorities have now paid attention to this and have already implemented some measures. We sincerely hope that this will be earnestly implemented to achieve the above-mentioned three tasks and achieve great victory with the least sacrifice!</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>The Sino-Soviet Highway (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Gongshuang</p>
<p>A Major Artery Connecting Sino-Soviet Direct Transportation</p>
<p>Commerce is very developed. Trade in minerals, livestock, and Japanese industrial products from Central Asia and European Russia, and the exchange of Chinese goods all rely on this place as a transshipment point. Now, it has become a concentration point for the Soviet Union to transport military supplies to China.</p>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Highway, due to the excessive length of the route and the arduousness of the project, still has many unsatisfactory aspects throughout the entire route. Except for the section belonging to the Soviet Union (the Tasha section), which is very good, other sections, such as the Xilan Road project, which cost more than one million yuan to build, are very sloppy. There are few culverts, and many places where the roadbed is not solid.</p>
<p>On the Gansu-Xinjiang Road, the bridges and culverts of the section from Yongdeng, Gulang, to Wuwei are not strongly built and are often in danger of being washed away by water. From Jiuquan westward to Xingxing Gorge, there are both Gobi Desert, sandy pits, and muddy beaches. Traveling on the Gobi Desert is not a problem, but sandy pits and muddy beaches often submerge the wheels, making it impossible to travel.</p>
<p>The government is now ordering the respective provincial governments and road bureaus to make great efforts to improve these shortcomings, some by repairing, some by rebuilding, and setting up more stations in uninhabited areas, so that this major artery in Northwest China can be actively revitalized to undertake great and arduous tasks.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the full-scale War of Resistance on "August 13" last year, transportation on this route has suddenly become busy. Sheng Shicai, the border defense commissioner of Xinjiang Province, immediately concentrated a large number of trucks, horse-drawn carts, camels, mules, etc., dedicated to transporting military supplies. He said to reporters from the East that the only help Xinjiang can give to the central government is in transportation. Therefore, I have concentrated these vehicles, camels, etc., hoping that military supplies can be delivered to the front line as soon as possible, and that is my responsibility.</p>
<p>After a few months of war, the government purchased new-style transport vehicles from the Soviet Union and also drove trucks from the east to participate in the transportation. Therefore, there are now enough trucks on this road to be described as endless. In total, the entire route is 4300 kilometers. It takes about 20 days for a car to travel from Semipalatinsk to Xi'an. Now, all the major stations along the route have gathered many vehicles and skilled drivers. When the truck from the previous station arrives at the next station, if the driver is tired, they will switch to an energetic driver, and if the truck is broken down, they will transfer the goods to a replacement truck at the station and then continue. This method, imitating the old "courier" system, can indeed make military supplies arrive at their destination faster. (End)</p>
<h3>National Government Uses British Loans to Complete Southwest Railway Network; Yunnan-Burma Railway to be Completed in Two Years; Shortening European International Transport</h3>
<p>The National Government has long planned to develop railway transportation in the Southwest, separately completing the Baoji-Chengdu, Sichuan-Xikang, Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Guizhou, Guizhou-Guangxi, Guangdong-Guangxi, Hunan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Burma, Hunan-Guangxi, and Indo-China railways, totaling eleven major lines with a total length of 6,400 kilometers. However, due to the large scale of the projects and the large amount of funding required, they cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, a Southwest Economic Construction Committee has been specially established, with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Zhang Qun serving as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, to raise 20 million yuan as a fund to formulate detailed plans and strive to complete them gradually within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Borrowing Successfully, Actively Building</p>
<p>Since Britain agreed to provide a credit loan of 10 million pounds, designated for the purchase of railway and other materials, the government authorities decided to first build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which connects Guizhou and Yunnan provinces to Burma. The route progresses westward from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, passing through Guangtong, Anning, Chuxiong, Mibo, Dali, Baoshan, Tengchong, and other places to Manyun Town on the Sino-Burmese border, and then from Manyun to Bhamo in Burma. The entire line is approximately 1,200 kilometers long and is expected to be completed within two years.</p>
<p>Opening Up European International Transport</p>
<p>The construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway is of great significance for opening up European international transportation. Because the terminus of the road, Bhamo, already has a railway connecting it to Rangoon, a seaport in Burma, after the completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, the two railways can be connected in Bhamo, then the sea journey between western China and Europe can be greatly shortened, without having to go around the Malay Peninsula, but can land directly in Rangoon and take a train directly to Kunming, saving at least a week of sea travel. At present, the Yunnan-Burma Highway has been completed and opened to traffic, making it even more convenient for the transportation of construction materials.</p>
<p>Surveys of Guizhou-Yunnan and Other Roads Completed</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Guizhou Railway from Guiyang to Kunming is approximately 750 kilometers long and requires a construction cost of 60 million yuan, and the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway from Xufu in Sichuan to Kunming has also been surveyed. Construction will begin soon. There is also the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway under construction, which is financed by a loan of 34.5 million yuan from the French bank group and 20 million yuan raised by the government and domestic financial circles. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company is responsible for the actual construction and is scheduled to be completed in the summer of next year.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Chinese to Obtain Passports in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Merchants Pay Six Dollars, Workers and Students Four Dollars; Must Be Guaranteed by Gentry, Merchants, or Firms to be Issued</p>
<p>Since the military situation, people who go abroad all transit through Hong Kong. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the passport department established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been established in Hong Kong as the Hong Kong Visa Commissioner's Office, which officially issued visas from December 12th of last year. The processing procedures are detailed below.</p>
<p>Establishment Process</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has been extremely difficult for people to obtain passports to go abroad to make a living. In order to take care of the people's livelihood and facilitate Chinese people to go abroad to do business, the government specially sent a document to the British government for consultation, and temporarily established a passport issuance office in Hong Kong (now located at No. 6, 5th Floor, Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong), appointing a commissioner. The British side agreed, and it was originally scheduled to start issuing visas on December 1st of last year, but due to preparation procedures, it was later changed to officially issuing visas on December 12th.</p>
<p>Passport Procedures</p>
<p>The current procedures for handling passports in Hong Kong are slightly different from the previous method. Applicants must undergo strict review by the issuance office and must be guaranteed by local gentry, merchants, or firms in Hong Kong before they can be issued. If any suspicious points are found, the office will refuse to issue the visa. Passports to various countries' territories must be signed by the respective consuls in Hong Kong before they can go abroad. The fees for merchants' passports are four Hong Kong dollars for the passport fee and two dollars for the stamp tax, totaling six dollars. Workers and students should pay two dollars for the passport fee and two dollars for the stamp tax, totaling four dollars. The passport date is about four or five days. The above passport procedures are temporary measures, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may change them in the future.</p>
<h3>Shipping Special</h3>
<p>The Chinese Prince, a ship of the Prince Line, set sail from New York yesterday and arrived in Hong Kong via Shanghai. It will arrive at Kowloon Wharf Bridge at 8 o'clock tonight. The cargo carried by the ship is about 1,000 tons. After the cargo is unloaded, it will sail into the Taikoo Dockyard for routine repairs. Also, the Silvercedar, which is also operated by the same line, may arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Japanese Empress, owned by Changxing Company, arrived in Hong Kong from Luzon this morning and is docked at Kowloon Wharf Bridge. After unloading passengers and cargo, it will also enter the dock for repairs. It will set sail at noon on the 24th of this month (Tuesday) to Shanghai, Kobe, Osaka, Honolulu, Canada, Vancouver, and other ports.</p>
<h3>From London to Paris (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>I plan to live in Europe for at least a month, and I also want to visit countries such as Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Therefore, a month is not enough. I had to follow the regulations, fill out an application, and wait for a decision. From June 11th, I waited until the beginning of July, when the Paris reply finally arrived. Because I am a student, I probably won't be looking for a job, so I was approved. However, the passport still had the words "The holder of this passport must never undertake paid or unpaid work in France" written in large letters. The consular staff also emphasized this to me. The seriousness of the unemployment problem can easily be found from this small end, a strong rebuttal (England also has the same regulations for immigrants.)</p>
<p>After the passport issue was resolved, I bought a ticket at Thomas Cook. There are four routes from London to Paris. The shortest route is the Dover-Calais route, which has the shortest time in the strait, and the price is relatively expensive. The longest route is the Newhaven-Dieppe route, which also has the longest time in the strait. Needless to say, the price is low. Most ordinary travelers take the Newhaven-Dieppe route. I also chose this route. A one-way third-class ticket costs about one pound and ten shillings. In addition, buy a travel certificate. In the future, you can buy tickets at a 60% discount for travel in Europe. On the morning of July 4th, I took my simple luggage, said goodbye to the landlady I had lived with for a year, and went to Victoria Station alone. I thought I could go early to find a better seat. Who knew that when I arrived at 8:30, the train had not yet arrived. I waited until 9:30 before the train entered the station. At that time, the passengers going to Europe were already crowded. It was hard to get on the train. When I looked at the third-class seats, many of them were labeled "Reserved." It turned out that British railways had a regulation for reserved seats, and the price was one shilling. I had not paid attention to this in advance, so I felt very difficult at the last minute. After running around for a long time, I finally got a seat. At this time, the station announced the wind and wave conditions in the strait, saying, "Light breeze, no fog." The storms in the English Channel are world-famous, so people traveling between England and France are always infinitely wary of crossing the strait. The reason why the Newhaven-Dieppe line is so cheap is precisely because the channel is longer. Everyone saw the report of the car girl, and felt more at ease, but who knows if there will be temporary changes.</p>
<p>The car started at 10:09. After about two hours of travel, it arrived at the British seaport of Newhaven. From here, get off the car and board the "Bristol" ferry. The congestion on the ferry is naturally needless to say. Fortunately, I met a British woman, Mrs. Miah, by chance. She teaches at a university in Edinburgh and often meets with Chinese students. Also, because she has a relative who lived in Fuzhou for many years, she has a special liking for Chinese people. At that time, Mrs. Miah found me a seat and chatted with me about current affairs in China, expressing great emotion. In the midst of a lonely boat, I unexpectedly met someone who truly understood China.</p>
<p>The ship was about to set sail, and suddenly a large group of people boarded, men, women, old and young, about 100 people. Among them, several women could not find seats, so they ran to the ship's rail where Mrs. Miah and I were sitting. After talking to them, I realized that this group of people was actually a Spanish opera troupe. They said, "Because of the war, we have to come out and sell our art to make a living." When I saw their encounters, and thought of myself, I really felt like "We are all wanderers in the world, why did we have to know each other before?" Naturally, when it came to China, they were even more sympathetic. I said, "Where is your home?" Their answer was, "Our home has been destroyed by the war, and in the future, we will only drift in the world." Alas, war is so sinful.</p>
<p>The ship set sail at 12:30. At this point, everyone's attitude seemed a little unnatural. I saw Mrs. Miah staring intently and silently. I asked her, "Are you afraid of seasickness?" Mrs. Miah seemed unhappy and said, "It's best not to mention this." I said, "The wind is very light today, maybe there won't be any problems." Mrs. Miah said, "You have to know, this is in the harbor. Once we leave the harbor, no one knows what the situation will be. When I saw her serious expression, I couldn't help but feel a little nervous.</p>
<p>The ferry left the harbor, and the wind seemed to be a little stronger, but it was also very ordinary. Since I came to England last year, I haven't had a life at sea for almost a year. This time, leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, watching the endless blue sea, lined with a few green mountains, sparkling and vast, I couldn't help but think of the scene of crossing the Indian Ocean last year. How fast time passed. In this short year, the world has changed so much.</p>
<p>There is Western food on the ship, but the price is very high. People who are experienced in going to Europe have already brought large bags of dry food. I don't have this experience. Thanks to Mrs. Miah's kindness, she gave me some meat sandwiches. The members of the opera troupe also invited me to join them for dinner. We chatted for a while and didn't feel lonely at all. They also brought their diary and asked me to write some Chinese characters. They looked at it and felt a strong interest. Finally, I translated their names into Chinese and wrote them on each person's diary, which can be regarded as a memorable thing during the voyage.</p>
<p>The waves were very weak, and Mrs. Miah also began to talk and laugh, but we sitting by the side of the boat were attacked by the sea wind and felt a little cold. Mrs. Miah tightened the velvet blanket all over her body. He looked at me and said, "I think you are very cold, go down to the cabin." Indeed, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I had to go down to the cabin. Not long after, I saw many passengers went down to the cabin. It turned out that the French harbor of Dieppe was vaguely visible in the distance. The three-hour sea journey would be over.</p>
<p>At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the ship docked at the pier. This time, I finally escaped the anger of the strait. Everyone congratulated each other. Before leaving, Mrs. Miah gave me a mailing address and said, "We can communicate often in the future if we have the chance." After thanking him, I said goodbye. The ends of the earth, I don't know when we will meet again in the future. When I went ashore, the first impression was that "English is no longer valid here." Everyone has to speak French. Just separated by a strait, the language is completely different. At that time, thousands of passengers were waiting for the inspection of French customs officers. There were only two or three customs officers, how could they cope with these passengers in a short period of time? So when checking, it has to be very hasty. This is very different from the British, who want to strictly enforce everything. We can often see the national character of each country from subtle places. French people often do things casually. After arriving in Paris, I got a lot more proof.</p>
<p>After the customs officials finished checking, the special train to Paris was already waiting at the pier. There are very few third-class cars, and almost eight or nine out of ten have been reserved. Therefore, passengers without reservations suffered the same embarrassment as when they got on the train in London. Everyone stared blankly at the empty seats labeled "Reserved". We had to stand temporarily next to the railway track, preparing to stand all the way to Paris. Fortunately, five minutes before departure, some reserved seats that had not arrived were vacated. The waiter invited us in, and we felt relieved. Therefore, I felt that if I have the experience abroad in the future, it is best to reserve seats within the possible range, so that you can save a lot of trouble at the last minute.</p>
<p>From Dieppe to Paris, the special train did not stop along the way, speeding across the French plains. I saw green hills and fields with green walls and vermillion roofs, which was very poetic and picturesque. It is said that among the four routes to France, this line is the most beautiful region. France is an agricultural country and has some similarities with China, but its farming methods have been completely transformed with new tools. As far as I have seen, machine harvesting and machine pumping are very common, but Chinese rural areas can be said to be still in the original period.</p>
<p>"Paris is here." After a burst of noise, everyone walked out of the Saint-Lazare station. I was introduced by a friend and booked at the Shapon Hotel, because it is close to the area where students live. Following the map, I took the subway and changed once. Finally arrived at the desired "Cluny" station. When I came out of the subway, I saw many cafes set up on the streets, already crowded. I had no intention to browse these, asking questions east and west, and finally found the Shapon Hotel, only to find that it was fully booked. There was a hotel next door called "Rhudes," which was also similar to Shapon. I found a room there, which was twice as big as the room I lived in London, but the rent was only 275 francs per month, only a little over nine francs per day, which was surprisingly cheap.</p>
<p>After running around for a long time, taking two trains, and crossing the strait once, I spent a full seven hours on the way. It was inevitable that I was a little tired from traveling back and forth. After having a delicious Chinese meal at the nearby Peking Restaurant, I went back to my residence to rest.</p>

<h3>Losing Territory and Losing Industries: A Sad History of Chinese Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a matter of public law, private law, wartime, or peacetime, there is no reason for forcibly seizing, annexing, or confiscating the industry and commerce operated by civilians. However, in the temporarily abandoned territories of China, all factories, companies, and large-scale agricultural products have been plundered and controlled by others. Sometimes, they nominally call it cooperation, but in reality, it is like a cuckoo occupying a magpie's nest. What kind of cooperation is there to speak of? What kind of "equality" can be mentioned? In the three northeastern provinces, there is no room for Chinese to operate. Eighty-five percent of the original companies and factories have been transferred to Japanese hands. If this continues, Chinese people will have nowhere to earn a living, and what business can Europeans and Americans hope to do? The following is a description of the devastation based on reports in Japanese newspapers and magazines, to show a glimpse of the destruction.</p>
<p>Entirely Based on Factories in the Shanghai-Songhu Area</p>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, Japanese merchants came to Shanghai to conduct large-scale activities immediately after the military operations. Not only did they want to restore their original factories, but they also wanted to use means of coercion and enticement to collude with weak-willed Chinese merchants to "cooperate" with them. Those with foresight refused to comply. Although their final fate was inevitably taken over under the so-called "military administration," or taken over by the "pacification team" and entrusted to the local "maintenance association," or even forcibly occupied and reopened by Japanese merchants as a means of plundering wealth. However, this kind of national spirit of preferring to be shattered rather than preserved completely, although it may suffer temporary losses, can still restore its former appearance and develop its business in the end. As for those who are willing to be accomplices, hoping to gain temporary benefits, cooperating with them, or muddling along, entrusting their operations to them, or selling their enterprises in the occupied areas to them, and not realizing that they have fallen into a bottomless abyss, it is very regrettable. According to a recent survey by the Shanghai-based reporter of the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo, in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the yarn factories, silk filatures, flour mills, cement plants, chemical industries, etc., originally operated by Chinese merchants, have already compromised and resumed work in the hands of the Japanese, or are already conducting "joint operations," or have been "forcibly occupied" and started work, as described below:</p>
<p>(1) Textile Industry: In the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are currently 37 Chinese-owned yarn factories operated by Japanese, with approximately 600,000 spindles and more than 5,300 looms.</p>
<p>(2) Silk Industry: Silk filatures in Wuxi, Suzhou, the western suburbs of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Qingpu, and other places are operated by the Sino-Japanese Silk Co., Ltd., in which the Japanese side is the major shareholder (total capital of 8 million Japanese yen, 6 million in cash shares, mainly owned by the Japanese side; the actual paid-up capital is only 3 million, and the remaining 2 million are in-kind shares, which are paid up by the Chinese side based on existing production equipment, etc.).</p>
<p>(3) Flour Industry: The four Chinese flour mills in the suburbs of Shanghai have decided to implement "joint operation" with the "Flour Milling Company" jointly operated by the Japanese Mitsui and Mitsubishi companies. One of the factories is operating on its own. In addition, those who have decided to "cooperate" with the Japanese include the Nanjing Yangzi Flour Mill and Sakamoto Ichizo, and the Wuxi Jiufa Flour Mill and the Shanghai Yoshida Company.</p>
<p>(4) Cement Industry: Those "jointly operated" with the Japanese Ono Demizu Pottery Co., Ltd. include the Shanghai Cement Company and the Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Company. The Nanjing China Cement Company is "cooperatively operated" with the Japanese Iwaki Suimon Pottery Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>(5) The ammonium sulfate plant of the Yongli Chemical Industry Co. in Yongkou has been entrusted to the Japanese Toyo Shoko Industrial Co. for operation and is currently being restored and repaired.</p>
<p>(6) The Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai was placed under the "military administration" of the Japanese Navy a long time ago and is operated by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese-owned factories in the four suburbs of Shanghai that are currently "jointly operated" with Japanese merchants and have been verified are said to include the following:</p>
<p>Original Chinese-Owned Factories, Currently Joined by Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Wuzhou Soap Factory - Japan Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Zhongyuan Tobacco Factory - Toyo Leaf Tobacco Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Xinhua Tobacco Factory - Toyo Tobacco Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Huadong Tobacco Factory - East Asia Tobacco Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Huapin Tobacco Factory - East Asia Tobacco Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Meili Alcohol Factory - Uetani Kisaburo</p>
<p>A Tree Factory - Fujimura Ichiro</p>
<p>China Cold Storage - Former Yonetaro Seisakusho</p>
<p>A Printing Factory - Shanghai Printing Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Jin Xin Rayon Weaving Factory - Muto Yoko</p>
<p>Zhanghua Woolen Factory (Xiaodong) - Shanghai Weaving Co.</p>
<p>Zhongxin Woolen Textile Factory (Yangshupu) - Zhu Zhifang and Mizuta Ryo</p>
<p>Da Zhonghua Paper Mill (Wusong) - Nikkachu Paper Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Paper Mill (Caojiadu) - Kanebo Textile Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Tian Zhang Paper Mill (Yangshupu) - Mizuno Yoshishi</p>
<p>Huaxing Yiji Paper Mill (Suzhou) - Shanghai Paper Co.</p>
<p>A Certain Lumber Factory (Suzhou) - Nomura Lumber Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>A Certain Lumber Factory (Suzhou) - Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Pudong Enamel (Suzhou) - Nakayama Steel Works</p>
<p>Gongdong Iron Factory (Yangshupu) - Asia Steel Industry Co.</p>
<p>Lide Oil Mill (Zhabei) - Japan Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>China Home Industry Soap Factory (Zhabei) - Chang Mao Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Zhenhua Paint Co. (Zhabei) - Japan Paint Co.</p>
<p>Kailin Paint Company (Jiangwan) - Dai Nippon Toryo Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>It is well known that the above-mentioned "cooperation" is a unilateral propaganda by the Japanese and is not credible. For example, it is not known whether the Wuzhou Soap Factory is the same as the Wuzhou Factory. If it is, the factory has already moved to the interior area and resumed operations, and there is no reason to cooperate with the Japanese. Also, the Meili Alcohol Factory is said to have resumed operations, but the name of the Japanese merchant Uetani Kisaburo appears in this table. The details of other factories are unknown. One hopes that since the Japanese have made this kind of publicity, they can use facts to make a formal statement to correct the public's perception and prevent the means of alienation, destruction, and usurpation. Hopefully, all factories will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Celebrate the New Year Yesterday; One-Dollar Movement Launched Simultaneously; Chambers of Commerce and Various Organizations Hold Events Simultaneously; Student Relief Association Holds Entertainment and Barter Fair to Raise Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the founding of our Great Republic of China. Moreover, during this national crisis, overseas Chinese from all walks of life here, remembering the difficulties of the late Premier and the martyrs in creating the country, and at a time when we are fighting for freedom and independence against a strong neighbor, had enthusiastic expressions for this great anniversary. At the same time, various overseas Chinese organizations took advantage of the New Year's Day holiday to launch a one-dollar debt repayment movement. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also promoted various trade guilds and native place associations to hold events separately. The situation in various aspects is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Market Conditions</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, all overseas Chinese community schools, organizations, and Chinese and Western shops took a day off to celebrate with flags. The national flags of China and the United Kingdom were flying everywhere in the city, and the number of tourists on the streets increased several times compared to usual. For a time, it was crowded and lively. The ferries, trams, and long-distance buses were all very crowded. People from all walks of life took advantage of the holiday to go to Macau for gambling and entertainment, which was even more crowded. The ships departing from Hong Kong were all full. The entertainment venues in various districts were especially crowded, and there were costume dances in various dance halls. Restaurants and tea houses in various districts had three times the usual profits. Peaceful decorations appeared everywhere before one's eyes. While enjoying the banquets and entertainment, did they also have a sense of homesickness that was unbearable to look back on?</p>
<p>Debt Repayment Movement</p>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a New Year's Day group worship meeting at noon on the fourth floor of the association. During the national crisis, the tea party was also cancelled, and only the ceremony was held. More than 30 people attended the meeting that day. Chairman Li Xingqu delivered a speech, encouraging all colleagues to recognize the current great crisis and take on their own national responsibility. Finally, he shouted the slogan "Long live the Republic of China," and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The one-dollar debt repayment movement launched by the association also started on that day. In addition to being implemented by the directors of the association, it was also divided among the native place associations and various trade guilds to be held simultaneously. Because the past two days were holidays, the debt repayment funds were changed to be received today. A receipt will be issued for each national currency of one yuan or more. After collecting the funds, they will be presented to the government. Lin Peisheng, chairman of the Guangdong Association, had previously donated 100 yuan for debt repayment and yesterday mobilized all his comrades to donate, with promising results. In addition, the Chinese Women's Association, the Women's War Relief Association, and the Women's New Movement Association were also launched simultaneously and actively carried out. When the Chairman Chen Jianbo of the Shizhen Chamber of Commerce celebrated the New Year's Day the day before yesterday, he initiated a response to the debt repayment movement and issued 20 donation cans, which were distributed by the directors of the association to collect donations. It is expected that the results will be considerable in the future.</p>
<p>Bartering to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The charity entertainment barter fair held by the Hong Kong Students Relief Association was held at St. Paul's College on Iron Hill on the morning of New Year's Day. Ms. Wang Xiaoying presided over the opening ceremony, and then the barter fair began. The order in the venue was extraordinary, and the items were abundant. Half of all the income of the association will be allocated to the association's domestic service team, and half will be used to relieve refugees. Men and women who came to the area on the first day were very crowded. The closing ceremony was held at 5 pm yesterday. It was found that more than 20 schools participated in the barter fair, including Hong Kong Shang, St. Joseph's, YWCA, St. God, Yangzhong, Zhixian, Women's Normal, St. Paul's, Lizhe, King's College, Overseas Chinese Wah Yan Branch, South Commercial, Fanglin, Xiao, Hanzhong, Huade, Queen's College, Continuing Education, Overseas Chinese College, Zhonghua, South China, Huaxia, Guangda, Jinling, Children's Group, St. Paul's, etc. It is heard that the fundraising results were very good.</p>
<p>Ambulance Donation Ceremony</p>
<p>The Kowloon-Hong Kong Education Association held an ambulance donation ceremony at the sports field of the Public Works Department in Causeway Bay on the morning of New Year's Day. More than a thousand teachers, staff, and students from various schools participated, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Mr. Lan Chunlin, a representative of the Guangdong Provincial Ambulance Committee, personally arrived at the venue to receive the donation. The meeting was held with due ceremony. Wang Shutao delivered the opening speech, Chen Tie reported on the fundraising and ambulance purchase process, and Zhang Lanzhou read the ambulance donation speech. Then, Mr. Lan Chunlin, the representative of the Guangdong Provincial Ambulance Committee, said in his speech that he was very honored to receive the two ambulances donated by the colleagues of the association and to participate in the grand event. On behalf of the association and the soldiers at the front, he sent greetings and hoped for victory in the war of resistance. Then, Huang Yanqing delivered a thank-you speech. After that, a wartime ambulance drill was performed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Daluoxian Hotel Forced to Move by Landlord; Refusal to Renew Lease Even with Voluntary Rent Increase; More Than 400 Guests Evacuated in a Mess Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Daluoxian Hotel at 88-102 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong, has been leasing and operating since 1934, and has been operating smoothly for several years. However, it suddenly announced its closure on the 28th of last month, and more than 400 guests were evacuated in a mess. At the same time, a notice was posted in front of the store stating the reason. The original text is recorded below, saying, "The landlord of 'XXXX' and other businesses is forcing us to move. After ten years of operation, we are forced into bankruptcy. All the employees of the store are unemployed at once, and the compatriots who live here are forced to flee in a mess. It is painful and heartbroken for the wealthy XXXX. Please, sir, pray for your consideration. Daluoxian sincerely writes."</p>
<p>All Equipment Automatically Destroyed</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the store had dismantled all of its own items and moved the furniture and other items. People who were watching the events were surprised by this action. Yesterday morning to night, many people gathered at the store to watch. When the reporter asked the person in charge of the store about the situation, they replied that since the lease of the building, they had never been in arrears with rent. Moreover, the business has improved slightly in recent years, and the value of the store is as high as 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. About six months ago, they received a notice from the landlord Guo X (the son of the wealthy Hong Kong businessman Guo XX, who passed away two years ago), asking them to move out within three months. The owner of the store pleaded repeatedly and promised to provide the rent at the value of others, but did not receive a reply. Thinking that the industry was aware of the difficulties of doing business, the order to take back the shop was rescinded, and they continued to operate with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Reason for Forced Eviction: Shop Run by Competitor</p>
<p>Until recently, they suddenly received a notice from the landlord, requiring them to move out within one month. The store learned that the reason why the landlord took back the shop was that a competitor's shop would be opened on the original site. Therefore, the store would rather sacrifice the store and demolish it completely than transfer it. It has been closed since the 28th of last month, and at that time more than 400 guests were evacuated in a mess. It is found that the housing problem in Hong Kong has become serious, and the Daluo Hotel being ordered to move is just one example. If the government does not solve it in a proper way as soon as possible, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China to Review Hong Kong Navy Tomorrow; At 10:00 AM at the Happy Valley Parade Ground</h3>
<p>All British troops and naval marines stationed in Hong Kong will hold a military parade at the Happy Valley Parade Ground on Sunday (tomorrow) at 10:00 AM. The reviewing officer will be Naval Commander-in-Chief Noble. The reviewing ceremony has been announced publicly a few days ago, and dignitaries from all walks of life in Hong Kong have been invited to attend. A separate location has been set up near the grandstand for the public to stand and watch. Those who attend should arrive at the venue early at 9:45 AM to avoid disrupting the order. If the weather is not good at that time, it will be postponed.</p>
<h3>Two of Our Soldiers Shot and Wounded by Indian Soldiers at the Fung Tau Chung Refugee Camp; Critically Ill After Entering the Hospital</h3>
<p>At the Mat Tau Chung refugee camp in Kowloon City, there were originally soldiers stationed in our group. However, at around 3:00 PM yesterday, the soldiers in the camp somehow had a verbal argument with the Indian soldiers who were monitoring the refugee camp, and then they started fighting. After a while, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and one Indian soldier, A, was shot in the abdomen, and another soldier, B, was stabbed in the back with a bayonet. Seeing this situation, the camp manager immediately telegraphed for a Red Cross car to come to the scene and sent the two wounded to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. After being admitted to the hospital, the two were still unconscious and feared for their lives.</p>
<h3>You Lie Memorial School to Build New School Building; Second Batch of Relief Supplies Donated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The You Lie Memorial School will add a large-scale secondary school department. The school site is near Shatin Station, and the area is very large, reaching more than 46,000 square feet. Currently, it is actively preparing to build a school building. It is heard that the plan includes classrooms, a lecture hall, a library, and a dormitory that can accommodate 2,000 people. The estimated construction cost is about 350,000 yuan. In the future, after this great You Lie Memorial Middle School is opened, it will be a special highlight in the education sector in Hong Kong. It is also heard that the second batch of clothing, medicines, and food for refugees in the primary school department has been handed over to the Emergency Relief Refugee Association for distribution.</p>
<h3>Chinese Art Association to Commemorate Ye Duanren Today; Commemorating a Young Soldier Who Died in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Ye Duanren (Guobin), the third executive director of the Chinese Art Association, joined the Hong Kong Xijiang Qili Guild's Return to the Country Service Group a few months ago and went to the Xijiang area to engage in national salvation propaganda and other battlefield work. He worked extremely hard. Recently, at the invitation of the Yunfu County People's Self-Defense Corps Command, he served as the political instructor of the county's Self-Defense Corps. In the middle of last month, while on official business from Yunfu to Xinxing, he happened to encounter X aircraft bombing and was unfortunately murdered by lawless soldiers who took the opportunity to loot his property and kill him to silence him. Now, the comrades of the association believe that Mr. Ye bravely participated in the war of resistance and died for his country, which is extremely sad. A memorial service will be held at 1:00 PM today at the association's address at 751 Nathan Road, Mong Kok. Members of the association and friends of Mr. Ye will be notified to attend at that time to express their condolences and encourage the future. It is found that Mr. Ye's original name was Guobin, also known as Duanren, pen name Mojun, 29 years old this year, from Xinxing County. He has been engaged in the news business in Hong Kong for many years and has served as an editor for the Hong Kong Dagguang Daily, Dazhong Daily, and Life Daily. He has written a lot. His writings have frequently appeared in the supplements of Life Daily and Dazhong Daily in previous years, and recently in the supplements of the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Pearl River Daily, and Independence Daily, as well as other magazines. He has progressive ideas, treats people sincerely, and has always been valued by colleagues in the literary and cultural circles. Now, he has suddenly been killed, and all parties are mourning him endlessly. It is heard that celebrities from the cultural, educational, and news circles in Hong Kong, as well as friends of Mr. Ye, have written articles and sent elegiac couplets to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>Journalists Association Will Also Issue a Declaration</h3>
<p>Since Wang Jingwei shamelessly issued a proposal to the central government, echoing the arrogant statement issued by the X cabinet on the evening of the 22nd, the world was in an uproar. It was generally believed that Wang's move was shaking the belief of the officials and people of our country in long-term resistance to Japan. Moreover, the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee joint meeting also decided to permanently expel Wang from the country and deprive him of all his powers and duties due to Wang's proposal. The Women's War Relief Association, the Hong Kong Women's New Movement Association, the China Noble Year Ambulance Corps, the Motorcycle Research Federation, etc.</p>
<p>Journalists Association to Issue Declaration</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Journalists Association believes that Wang once had a historical position in the party and the country. Now, he has suddenly issued this proposal, and its impact must be great. In order to dispel public doubts and clarify the wrong claim, at the association's third executive committee and supervisory committee joint meeting yesterday, it was decided to support the central government's resistance to the end and oppose Wang Jingwei's proposal for peace. It is heard that the content of the official statement will point out the past course of our country's resistance to Japan and the advocacy of resistance to the end, and affirm that only by resisting to the end in this war can we achieve final victory. Any compromise will lead to destruction. And Wang's proposal this time is originally in response to the 近衛之主 of the X cabinet, intending to eliminate our belief in resistance through the smoke screen of peace talks, which must be strictly corrected in order to correct the general view. It is heard that the declaration has already been drafted and will be issued during the day.</p>
<h3>Kuang Guangyin Hosts Press Conference to Report on the Collection of Exhibits</h3>
<p>Kuang Guangyin, director of the Golden Gate Exposition and the Chinese Commercial Exhibition Company, came to Hong Kong to collect exhibits and is about to complete his task. He will return to the United States on the 5th of this month. Before Mr. Kuang's departure, in order to report on this trip, a press conference will be held at the Datong Restaurant on the fifth floor at 4:00 PM on the 4th. Invitation cards have been issued. Among the exhibits collected by Mr. Kuang this time, the most interesting ones include two golden dragons, one silver dragon, and one lion. The content of the Chinese village at the exhibition will include Cantonese opera, Beijing opera, martial arts, Guan Di Temple, a grand theater, a bar, a restaurant, an amusement park, a puppet show, and a product display. The total construction cost will reach US$250,000.</p>
<h3>Knowing the Law and Breaking the Law: Two Firefighters Steal During a Fire; Hu Shi and Chen Jianwu Both Jailed</h3>
<p>At about 3:00 AM last Saturday morning, a fire broke out at 76 Qi Jiedun Street. British Constable Tai, who was guarding the buildings opposite the fire scene, discovered that firefighter Hu Shi was stealing a handful of darts on the second floor of No. 47. After being released on bail, he was imprisoned for disciplinary action. Until yesterday morning, another firefighter named Chen Chuangwu was released on bail to Central Magistracy He Sitang, accused of stealing silver coins and cufflinks, and other items from the resident Huang Bin on the second floor of No. 45. According to Tai Lai's testimony, when he patrolled to that place, he saw that the door of the building was tightly closed, and there was a dog barking inside. Tai Lai peered through the crack and felt that there were shadows moving. Then he broke down the door and saw the defendant coming out of the back room, and then discarded the items on the chair. The victim testified that the items were stored in the drawer. When the fire broke out, all the residents of the building fled. After the interrogation, the official ruled that the defendant was a public official and dared to steal by relying on his position, which was illegal, and sentenced him to three months of hard labor. He Si praised Tai Lai for repeatedly solving similar cases.</p>
<h3>A Heroic Act on the Waters of Lingdingyang; Our Two Fishing Boats Bravely Resist and Sink Four X Boats; Six or Seven X Sailors Die at Sea; More Than Ten of Our Fishermen Also Heroically Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Since X warships blockaded the coast of South China, fishermen have been poisoned and harmed. Fishermen in Hong Kong have suffered especially severely. Until recently, it seemed to have decreased on the surface, but in fact, there are still many victims. However, after the fishermen are in distress, most of them have not reported it due to the fact that the procedures are not in place. Recently, there was an incident of X warships forcibly seizing fishing boats on the Henglan Sea, and at the same time, there was an incident of fishermen heroically resisting X on the waters of Lingdingyang, resulting in the sinking of four X boats and the drowning of six or seven people. More than ten fishermen heroically sacrificed. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Bravely Resisting X and Sinking Four Boats</p>
<p>It is found that Lin Shanjun, a fisherman from Cheung Chau, sailed two Guanghai fishing trawlers with more than 40 partners on the 27th of last month to go out to sea for fishing. When they sailed to the waters of Lingdingyang, they encountered an X warship. Lin and others knew that it was difficult to escape, so they ignored it and did not run away. They also prepared everything to wait for the X people to come and fight them. They were not willing to coexist. Before long, the X warship sent out four rubber speedboats to approach the boat and try to forcibly board it. Lin and others knew that the time had come, so they ordered their partners to fire cannons at the X. With a loud bang, four X boats were hit and sank, and about six or seven X sailors in the boats died at sea.</p>
<p>Fishermen and Fishing Boats Burned by X</p>
<p>At that time, in addition to Lin Shanjun's two Guanghai fishing trawlers, there was also a Zhapo trawler with more than ten people on board. After the incident, the three-story fishing boat tried to set sail and escape, but it was discovered by X people. An armed speedboat was sent to chase them, and the Zhapo trawler was intercepted by the X ship first. X soldiers boarded the ship with weapons, with great momentum. First, they detained everyone in the cabin, buckled the cabin door backwards, then sprinkled kerosene on various parts of the ship, set it on fire, and burned it to the ground in an instant. More than ten people were heroically sacrificed. After burning the boat, the X soldiers crossed to Lin Shanjun's two Guanghai trawlers, searched them, and then dragged them to Yizhou near Macau. They drove more than ten people on the boat to a lonely island, and then left the boat. Several hours later, a boat passed by and carried Lin and others to Macau, and took a boat back to Hong Kong to report the incident to the Fishermen's Association.</p>
<p>X Robs Fishing Boat on Henglan Sea</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, at 3:00 PM, there was another incident of X robbing a fishing boat on the Henglan Sea. The fishing boat involved was No. 3366HW. At that time, the fishing boat was fishing in the waters of Henglan, in the British territorial waters. It suddenly encountered an armed X fishing boat. Before they could escape, X soldiers forcibly boarded the boat and searched it. As a result, they robbed property worth a total of 4,000 yuan, and turned over all the ship's license and all the items on the ship, and then swaggered away after the robbery. Fortunately, there were no casualties. The boat had already sailed back to Aberdeen on the 30th to report to the association.</p>
<h3>Sham Shui Po, So Uk Village: Seven Robbers Loot Thatched House and Flee</h3>
<p>In Sham Shui Po, So Uk Village, a thatched house without a clear address was suddenly invaded by seven black-clad robbers wielding short guns at 7:55 PM last night. The owner and his family were threatened by the robbers, who ransacked the house, seizing clothing and money before fleeing. The owner later reported the incident to the Sham Shui Po Police Station, and detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate. All district police stations were also notified to assist in the apprehension.</p>
<h3>Failed Resumption of Shipping Between Guangdong and Hong Kong; Resumption of Transportation Between Guangdong and Macau; × Claims Weekly Service, Limited to × Persons and Sino-Portuguese Passengers</h3>
<p>Since × occupied Guangzhou, water and land transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has remained blocked. ×, seeking to monopolize shipping rights on the Pearl River, has refused to allow any external interference. Consequently, Rear Admiral Noble, the British Naval Commander in China, previously proposed opening the Pearl River to the × forces invading Guangzhou, but without success. Negotiations were terminated, and no further attempts have been made. Guangzhou remains a dead city amidst chaos. Recently, ×, in order to maintain external transportation for Guangzhou, shifted its focus to Macau. On the 22nd of last month, an armed × vessel was dispatched from Guangzhou to Macau. On the 25th, it returned from Macau, transporting mail from various parties routed through Macau to Guangzhou. Transportation between Guangdong and Macau has thus been restored. According to × sources, a ship will now travel between Guangzhou and Macau once a week. Passengers are strictly limited to Chinese citizens and × nationals. However, as Macau is a Portuguese colony, Portuguese citizens may also travel due to the environment. Other nationalities will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Each voyage will be limited to a maximum of thirty passengers, who must obtain travel permits from the × consuls in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, as well as from the Guangzhou Naval and Military Commander, before boarding.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief for Victims of Robbery; Widespread Suffering in Boluo County; County Seat and Surrounding Villages Devastated; Relief Committee Dispatches Representatives to Hong Kong to Appeal for Aid</h3>
<p>The recent fall of the East River region has devastated Huiyang, Boluo, and Zengcheng counties, with Boluo suffering the most severe impact. There are over 40,000 refugees. The Boluo County Relief Committee has dispatched standing committee members Liu and Huang Jinyong to Hong Kong and Macau to seek aid from fellow countrymen, overseas Chinese, and charitable organizations. Mr. Liu and Mr. Huang arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and have reported on the disaster situation to various sectors, seeking clothing donations. They described the dire situation in the county to reporters as follows:</p>
<p>Boluo County Seat Reduced to Rubble</p>
<p>According to reports, hundreds of shops in Boluo County have been reduced to rubble. This is because, two or three days before the county fell (October 12th to 15th), it was heavily bombarded. After × forces captured the county, they set fires, leaving seven or eight thousand residents without shelter. Most ancestral halls and temples were also burned. Even those that escaped destruction suffered from leaking roofs and damaged walls. Other major towns in various districts were also completely destroyed, such as Paiwei Market in the second district, Xiangshui Market and Batang Market in the third district, and Futian Market and Changning Town in the fourth district. Each of these towns had at least hundreds of shops, now reduced to flat ground. The surrounding villages of the aforementioned towns were also almost entirely destroyed. Farmers, fearing massacre, did not dare return home to harvest their winter rice, so even a bountiful harvest was essentially lost. Almost all villages along the roads near the entire county suffered terribly, affecting over two thousand households.</p>
<p>Over Three Thousand People Killed</p>
<p>In the villages attached to the county seat alone, besides the county seat itself, Tianpai and Yihe villages were mostly burned down. In the second district, besides Paiwei, Zhongtu and Xiunv Lake villages were devastated. Lian'an in the third district, and Guoshi, Lianhe, and Qingdeng in the fourth district were . In short, out of the entire county's thirty-five villages, seventeen have , resulting in over three thousand civilian deaths. Women, children, and the elderly were fortunate to escape to the mountains, but due to malnutrition and exposure to mountain mists and miasma, most are now ill. Furthermore, the severe cold weather and lack of clothing exacerbates their plight. The provincial government has allocated 15,000 yuan for emergency relief, and the 157th Division has donated about 200 bags of rice. However, this is just a drop in the bucket. The Relief Committee finds it difficult to provide adequate assistance. The disaster is severe, and there are many refugees. Without the help of our fellow countrymen and overseas Chinese, it will be impossible to fulfill even the minimum required tasks.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Herbert Investigates the War Situation in China; Arrives in Hong Kong from America Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Herbert, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday with his wife aboard the "Peter Miers." According to him, the newspaper pays particular attention to the profound significance of the Far East conflict in global relations and plans to establish a column dedicated to Far Eastern issues. This trip is on behalf of the newspaper to conduct on-the-ground investigations. He will stay in Hong Kong for a short period and plans to take the "Beysher" to Cape Town on the 5th of this month. He hopes to fully understand the impact of the current war on America during his stay in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>A Westerner in Tai O Reports Multiple × Warships Passing Through Hong Kong Waters Daily; Their Destination is Unknown, Seeming to Indicate Some Kind of Plan</h3>
<p>According to a Westerner who arrived in Hong Kong from Tai O yesterday, three Japanese warships passed through the waters west of Hong Kong's territorial sea, near Tai O, at dusk yesterday. Several smaller motorboats followed. The warships were not very large and were all heading west. Their destination is unknown. Later that day, two more Japanese warships headed south. They were clearly visible from Tai O. An armed fishing boat accompanied these warships.</p>
<h3>Peterson's Ambition Finally Realized; The "Peng Cheng" Sailboat Left Hong Kong Yesterday for America; A Brief Stop in Singapore Before Continuing</h3>
<p>Australian Peterson's plan to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to America aboard the sailboat "Peng Cheng" was initially scheduled for Christmas Day, but was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. This was previously reported in the newspaper. Despite setbacks, Mr. Peterson persevered and finally set sail from the bay on Saturday afternoon. Passing ferries all wished him a safe journey. Accompanying Mr. Peterson on this voyage are two Americans, Zhu Lier and Bao Xieer, a Danish man, Morgan Xin, a Chinese cook, and an Indian crew member, a total of seven people. He has prepared ten thousand US dollars for the construction and equipment costs of the ship, which he believes is sufficient to cover the entire journey. Before departure, there were reports of turbulent winds and waves in the South China Sea, but Mr. Peterson believes this is the best opportunity to test the safety of his ship. The ship's sail area is 3,600 square feet. If the wind is favorable, the journey will be quite fast. He plans to stop in Singapore for a considerable period of time to replenish supplies and food before embarking on the arduous voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. The ship is also equipped with a radio telegraph, operated by Mr. Fei Xieer, which will communicate with the world. A travel report will be broadcast every evening at 8:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Adorning the Victorious New Year; A Sketch of an Extraordinary Gathering; The Anniversary Celebration of the Printing Industry Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Confucius Hall on New Year's Day was covered with such red couplets: "To seek benefits, one must fulfill obligations"; "Improve our lives under fair and reasonable principles"; "Workers and employers unite to increase wartime production"; "Respond to the One Yuan Movement to revive the Chinese nation"; "..." The anniversary celebration of the Hong Kong Printing Industry Workers' Union was held in such a hall.</p>
<p>The workers changed out of their oily and dirty work clothes and put on new clothes; this rare "daytime" was a blessing for those accustomed to "night work"; each of them collectively celebrated the New Year with "joyful" smiles; each of them was filled with unlimited hope for the New Year.</p>
<p>"Workers: May your New Year be filled with happiness! You are powerful promoters of social progress"—the reporter sincerely pays you the highest respect.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, salutations, reports, speeches, proposals... The opening ceremony passed by. But what deeply moved the reporter was their singing and tea party.</p>
<p>Most of the choirs we usually see belong to young students and schoolchildren; however, this choir of the Printing Industry Workers' Union, roaring on the stage, was composed entirely of workers who had left school. More than thirty of them lined up in two rows, with several female workers in the middle wearing braids, some makeup, and new green clothes, occasionally laughing shyly and happily, as if proudly showing off that they were not just someone's daughter-in-law, not playthings of the powerful, but workers who, by their own labor, were promoting social progress. Although they were older and surrounded by the suffering of material life, they still sang and retained their youth. How moving this is!</p>
<p>There was also a group of older male workers with wrinkles etched on their faces by wind and frost, wearing long "merchant-style" robes, who actually opened their throats and sang patriotic songs, as if proudly showing off that they were not greedy merchants who only seek profit; proudly showing off that they could still be as innocent as their children, younger brothers, and younger sisters. How inspiring this is!</p>
<p>They sang seven or eight patriotic songs in a row: "He killed our compatriots," "He forcibly occupied our land"... The seeds sown in Hong Kong by the Wuhan Chorus have even sprouted in workers' groups. The heart-shaking national songs made people realize that they were in the midst of the great era.</p>
<p>The tea party for the guests was set up in a small corner of the courtyard; the arrangement of the tables and chairs and the simple refreshments piled high on the wooden tables fully demonstrated the true nature of the workers. Although it was not as luxurious as a banquet in a certain restaurant, the workers' genuine expressions made people feel appreciated and loved.</p>
<p>After the tea party, Mr. Lin Guangfu, the person in charge of the union, told the reporter: There are more than 5,000 printing workers in Hong Kong, and more than 3,000 have joined the union.</p>
<p>Regarding the work the union has done in the past, in addition to participating in the national salvation movement to the extent possible, it has achieved considerable success in Mandarin classes, singing, first aid, drama, and sports. In the New Year, it will strengthen and expand current affairs discussions. Industrial technology improvement seminars, common sense seminars, and other self-education activities will also be held. We sincerely hope that the workers will strive to improve their cultural level and standard of living in this New Year of national revival.</p>
<p>Returned from this interesting gathering on New Year's Day with an excited heart. (Qi Zhuo)</p>

<h3>The Secret to Getting Rich Quick</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuping</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: There is no disparity between rich and poor in China, only the difference between great poverty and small poverty. Indeed, if we compare China's rich with the wealthy elites of Europe and America, they are truly pitiful - why is China only poor, not rich? The reason is: Because China is a semi-colony, we are subjected to the economic oppression of imperialists.</p>
<p>The poor cannot even eat their fill of vegetable roots; the rich can ride in cars, live in foreign houses, and eat fancy meals. Who doesn't hope to be rich and enjoy the taste of cars, foreign houses, and fancy meals? However, it seems that most people cannot. Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us: We must eliminate the oppression of the aggressors and earn back the wealth of our nation, and then we can live a good life. Therefore, people only think about how to get money. The methods they think of generally fall into two categories: one is to work hard and save frugally, hoping to accumulate some money; the other is to engage in speculative gambling, hoping to get rich by chance. Thus, in this impoverished China, the practice of speculative gambling seems to be particularly prevalent - this has its social roots.</p>
<p>Catering to this psychological demand, many tricks such as teaching shortcuts to wealth have emerged in society. Recently, I found an advertisement in the newspaper teaching a shortcut to wealth. The gist of it is: At this time when everyone feels the pain of unemployment, I can teach you a shortcut to wealth, but after I teach you, you must serve me unconditionally for three years.</p>
<p>It seems that this so-called shortcut to wealth is probably just teaching vocational skills. Whether it can really lead to wealth remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I remember that a few years ago, a certain tycoon - that is, a rich and powerful big shot - died, and many newspapers published his life story in great detail. How did he get rich?</p>
<p>He started as a worker. Relying on saving a little money from his work, he lent that money out to collect interest. This increased his wealth a lot, so he opened a small factory. Relying on the blood and sweat of the workers, his factory developed and defeated other people's factories and merged with other people's factories. In this way, he swallowed up many factories, and he became a giant of trust - a certain tycoon.</p>
<p>This story of getting rich illustrates a principle to us: that certain tycoon got rich by eating the blood of others - interest, the blood and sweat of workers, and the blood and sweat of other small capitalists - making himself fat. This is a true picture of the cruel exploitation of capitalism.</p>
<p>However, in China, this semi-feudal society, there is an even more cruel system of exploitation: A young man wants to learn a bit of professional technology, he must usually do a lot of labor for the "master," and after learning, he must unconditionally work for the "master" for two or three years without pay. Before the time limit expires, he has no freedom to work - this is the so-called "apprenticeship system."</p>
<p>That gentleman who teaches shortcuts to wealth is just using a social psychology, using getting rich to recruit apprentices. If he can recruit hundreds of apprentices to give him unconditional "service" for a few years, he himself will get rich by eating the blood of hundreds of people. This unreasonable apprenticeship system should be eliminated in the process of resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of Private First Class Sato</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>—A Story Drawn From a Japanese Account</p>
<p>"Ah—that is," Kanatani replied in surprise, "that's a terrible thought. Why do you suddenly ask that?"</p>
<p>"This thought has been haunting my mind for a long time—don't you ever think about it?"</p>
<p>Kanatani put his hands in his army trouser pockets, shrugged his shoulders, and said in a melancholy tone:</p>
<p>"I simply don't dare think so freely!"</p>
<p>"Why—are you afraid of something?"</p>
<p>"Worried about going crazy because of it?"</p>
<p>"But these thoughts just keep coming up!" Sato said, frowning.</p>
<p>Kanatani sighed, raised his head, and looked at the sky.</p>
<p>On the other side of the path, two soldiers with urns of ashes hanging on their chests were talking about something on the hillside.</p>
<p>"There's no hope of replenishing the unit either," Kanatani muttered to himself.</p>
<p>"This war..."</p>
<p>Sato's attention was suddenly drawn to the corpse of a Chinese soldier lying beside the road.</p>
<p>"Our end will be like this too," he thought, and immediately said to Kanatani.</p>
<p>Kanatani didn't answer silently, his high shoulders were trembling slightly. Obviously, he was disturbed by the agitation of his emotions.</p>
<p>He murmured; "We're really being sacrificed! If the family expects news of death"...</p>
<p>But Kanatani's point didn't catch Sato's attention at all, he fell into another train of thought...</p>
<p>He suddenly said to Kanatani like this: "I heard that some people in other units have already opposed the war, is that right?"</p>
<p>"I heard some too,"</p>
<p>"I wonder how it's going?"</p>
<p>"This, the officers forbid it very strictly," Kanatani smiled bitterly: "But I heard that quite a few were shot."</p>
<p>Sato then remembered, three weeks ago, when the Nakamura unit was stationed in ×× County, he had indeed heard a soldier in another unit say that several dozen soldiers who had been transferred back from the front line had been secretly executed that morning. "That's probably because they've been fighting for a long time," he guessed.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow we have to start fighting again," Kanatani said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Yes, maybe we'll only live through today."</p>
<p>As Sato spoke, he fell into deep melancholy and sorrow again, he imagined, as if a high wall had sprung up before his eyes. That high wall was really high, standing high, blocking the sea, blocking his hometown and family on the other side of the sea, blocking the sky and the sun, he felt that that high wall was separating him from life...</p>
<p>The weight of a thousand pounds of melancholy and sorrow pressed on his heart so heavily that Sato even wanted to draw his gun and end his life.</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
<h3>The Autumn Wind Rises</h3>
<p>— Li Ruochuan</p>
<p>Fences,</p>
<p>Fields,</p>
<p>Wilderness,</p>
<p>The autumn wind rises.</p>
<p>Crickets chirping everywhere,</p>
<p>Complaining bitterly about a year of war.</p>
<p>Today,</p>
<p>Our children resisting Japan, still,</p>
<p>Put on their uniforms,</p>
<p>Quietly awaiting this solemn bugle call,</p>
<p>The prelude to war,</p>
<p>Galloping on the fields of blood,</p>
<p>In the daytime,</p>
<p>In the nighttime,</p>
<p>Listening to the crow's cry,</p>
<p>Watching the moon set,</p>
<p>A desolate scene,</p>
<p>Cannot shake our conviction in victory.</p>
<p>Our spirited ambition,</p>
<p>In the trenches,</p>
<p>Guarding countless dark nights,</p>
<p>Everyone is anticipating,</p>
<p>A new dawn.</p>
<p>At that time,</p>
<p>The autumn wind rises,</p>
<p>Shivering,</p>
<p>Fallen leaves,</p>
<p>It is an endless desolation again,</p>
<p>As if having crossed a mountain,</p>
<p>Another stream of boundless misty water.</p>
<p>Only ah,</p>
<p>Next year,</p>
<p>At this time,</p>
<p>Outside the threshold,</p>
<p>To every peaceful family,</p>
<p>The autumn wind is howling:</p>
<p>Children fighting for survival,</p>
<p>You have won your first anniversary of victory.</p>
<h3>Clearing Away the Filth</h3>
<p>— Wang Jianming</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is like a great furnace, those who can withstand the forging within becoming refined steel, and those who cannot becoming dross, and the destination of the dross is usually the garbage heap.</p>
<p>Recently, the attention of the entire country has been focused on the actions of a certain person, and I feel that this is really a waste. For something that was expected, it should not be given such importance when it is realized. This is just as ordinary as dross being dumped on a garbage heap.</p>
<p>Some kind people still hope that she can turn back, and I think this is also superfluous. There have been many well-intentioned admonitions to him in the past, and the severe criticism of his words and deeds has been done to the best of our ability, and the lessons given to him by objective facts cannot be said to be anything less than abundant and cruel, but in the end, they have failed to correct him. He still released fallacies, and his final fall into the dirtiest place is a natural principle. When a person becomes so stubborn that he is unwilling to love himself, if others still harbor kind illusions, it is either too stupid or meddlesome!</p>
<p>The appearance of a few obvious Zheng Xiaoxus and Wang Kemins in the War of Resistance cannot be said to be how great a harm, but it is these things hiding in the large ranks and doing some sneaky things that are the greatest danger! Even if they only play the role of stumbling blocks, they will cause the children of the Republic of China to shed infinite blood. It is a very good phenomenon that they can go to the place where they should go as soon as possible. If there is still something that makes us regret, it is that we have repeatedly failed to bring the national scum of the Wang Kemin type to justice in advance!</p>
<p>If anyone is worried about what bad consequences the departure of a certain person will have, then it is best to go to the garbage heap to see the abandoned dross: trampled by everyone until it is crushed into powder!</p>
<p>Let him go to the place where he should go, and it is important to stick to our right path.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day Festival</h3>
<p>— Lie Ke</p>
<p>The sunlight streamed in through the window, and the indoor lamplight, as if conquered, immediately dimmed, blending into a rich, golden-yellow light.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shen woke up especially early today. Opening her eyes, she realized that Yi Zhen and Yi Lun, who had been sleeping at the foot of the bed, had already run out from under the covers. She put on her robe, got out of bed, and repeatedly called out, "Nanny, nanny!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Coming," Nanny He, who had just risen from refugee to nanny, responded and ran upstairs.</p>
<p>"Where did the two children go? Did they put on the two new sets of clothes that were made?"</p>
<p>"I didn't really pay attention, it seems—they're wearing—wearing student uniforms?" Nanny He replied anxiously.</p>
<p>"You—you're really muddle-headed! Call them up here! Don't you want any decency on this good day!" Mrs. Shen angrily instructed her.</p>
<p>Nanny He hurried to the side of the road, called the children back, opened the closet, took out one piece of clothing after another, and busied herself dressing them. After a while, Yi Lun had changed into a sharp-looking Western-style suit, and Yi Zhen had put on a bright woolen sweater over her velvet cheongsam. Mrs. Shen herself also changed into a brand new winter outfit. She pulled the children over, looked carefully at them in the mirror for a while, and smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>"That's more like it, otherwise, how could we go out? Today is New Year's Day, the first day of 1939!"</p>
<p>"Mom—isn't it the first day of the 28th year of the Republic?"</p>
<p>"Who remembers the Republic or not? Anyway, 1939 is correct—oh—this outfit of your mom's is really '1940 style'!"</p>
<p>It turned out that Mrs. Shen, who was usually immersed in mahjong and jokes, had become almost carelessly indifferent to everything and had gotten used to a life of inverted days and nights. Each time, each time, she would excitedly expend her energy, spending the long nights playing mahjong. …</p>
<p>Recently, she suddenly felt the weather turning cold, and the mercury in the thermometer was dropping every day. Even the calendar on her desk had only a few thin pages left. She was surprised to realize: oh, how fast! Another year is over. Indeed, she felt a bit of reluctance and cherished the time that had flown by. But when she thought of another idea, she grinned and said:</p>
<p>"Bad luck year, hurry up and pass! Next year will definitely be smoother. When gambling, at least I won't lose money, right?"</p>
<p>On the last day of the month, she sent Nanny He to school to pick up Yi Zhen and Yi Lun and bring them home.</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day, which is also the first day of what Mrs. Shen considers to be the most prosperous year. She naturally had an indescribable joy for such a once-a-year auspicious day and beautiful scenery. In addition to significant attention to her clothing, she also prepared for a "perfect feast", and even the interior of the house was tidied up to be pleasing to the eye. After all, she was still a competitive person, and she wanted to take advantage of her son and daughter being in front of her to help her rush through a few things. The first thing was to order Yi Lun to bring an old calendar, turn it over page by page, and carefully examine the blank back. When they encountered accounts written out, such as "Miss Zhang owes ten yuan", "Mrs. Qian owes eight yuan", "Mrs. Cao is short five yuan"... she would instruct Yi Zhen to extract them one by one... After spending half an hour, she finally sorted out this muddled account. Then, she began the second task, wanting to have a heart-to-heart talk with her children, whom she hadn't talked to in a long time.</p>
<p>"Yi Zhen, in the blink of an eye, you'll be graduating. I don't think you need to go to college anymore—in this chaotic world, it's better to stay at home and help with miscellaneous tasks!"</p>
<p>"Who wants to? Didn't Dad send a letter approving it? So, I've decided to return to China to participate in the war of resistance." The sixteen-year-old daughter replied stubbornly. "Hey—so old, and still so disobedient—giving you comfort doesn't please you, you insist on courting death." Before she could finish speaking, she immediately continued with a remorseful tone: "Ah! Muddle-headed, on a good day, saying such inauspicious words, ah! I forgot it's New Year's Day—I should be slapped, I should be slapped, nonsense, nonsense!" At the end, she spat out two thick mouthfuls of phlegm.</p>
<p>"Moreover, Dad's letter said that you can't play mahjong anymore. He said that during this national crisis, playing mahjong is the most evil, worst, and most harmful act against the war of resistance!" Yi Zhen pointed out another way to accuse her!</p>
<p>"Who's going to listen to that old dotard's nonsense... Opening his mouth, 'national crisis', closing his mouth, 'national survival', such deceptive words, it's sickening to hear—good—blame me for playing mahjong, so he's holding onto the money and won't send it! Fine!..."</p>
<p>"Dad's idea is very reasonable. Mom wastes money, of course it's unreasonable." Unexpectedly, the twelve-year-old son also retorted.</p>
<p>"Good, wastes money—what about you two?... Quickly hand over the ten yuan that Nanny He gave you last week!"</p>
<p>"Haha—we donated it to the school for the 'One Yuan Movement'!"</p>
<p>"Hey—it turns out you've become so extravagant."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shen's heart was full of joy, but it was dispelled by the children's mischief. She was very angry in her heart. The children were not yet adults and dared to rebuke their mother so aggressively! Thinking of this, her heart filled with anger, and several hot tears fell from her face, each drop landing on her "1940 style" winter outfit!</p>
<p>Suddenly, several disturbing noises came from outside the window. Mrs. Shen repeatedly called out, "Nanny, nanny!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Coming," Nanny He responded and ran upstairs, her face full of smiles, but when she caught a glimpse of the tearful anger on Mrs. Shen's face, she immediately clouded her face over!</p>
<p>"Auntie, on this good day, who is arguing in front of the door!"</p>
<p>"That—those are the shop assistants from the neighboring few houses, going together to donate—donate to some 'One Yuan Movement'—oh! Madam! I also donated one yuan!"</p>
<p>"Hmm—" Mrs. Shen didn't say anything. She looked at the children's faces standing next to her, but a triumphant smile flew onto their cheeks.</p>

<h3>Singapore Chinese Football Team to Come to Hong Kong for Matches in Early March; Schedule of Three Matches in Hong Kong Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Hong Kong and Shanghai have now become isolated islands, but Hong Kong's football scene is much livelier than Shanghai's.</p>
<p>Last year's Hong Kong-Shanghai埠 (埠 can mean port/large city with port) competition was originally scheduled for the Hong Kong team to travel to Shanghai for matches, but due to the unstable environment in post-war Shanghai, the Hong Kong team did not dare to make the trip. Last autumn, Shanghai once again sent a message, inviting the Hong Kong team to go north and hold a competition on the Lunar New Year's Day. However, the Hong Kong team also did not accept the invitation, instead inviting the Shanghai team to come south. The Shanghai team also considered it difficult to travel, so the埠inter-city competition was still suspended this year.</p>
<p>Just recently, the Singapore Chinese team sent Xu Jukun to Hong Kong to discuss the matter of coming to Hong Kong for matches during the Lunar New Year. The South China Athletic Association believed that since there would be no inter-city competition at that time, the Singapore team's willingness to come was a good opportunity. After several contacts, it has been finalized.</p>
<p>It is now confirmed that the Singapore team will depart from Singapore on February 27th and arrive in Hong Kong on March 3rd. Three matches have been scheduled in Hong Kong, with the following schedule:</p>
<p>March 4th (Saturday): Singapore Chinese Team vs. Hong Kong All-Stars</p>
<p>March 5th (Sunday): Singapore Chinese Team vs. South China Athletic Association</p>
<p>March 8th (Wednesday): Singapore Chinese Team vs. South China Athletic Association or Hong Kong-Singapore Chinese All-Stars vs. Military All-Stars</p>
<h3>Charity Football Match: Regular Army Wins by One Goal; Ms. Lin Qimei Presents Awards On-Site</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Sports Community Service Corps, initiated by the South China Athletic Association, held a charity football match at加山 (Ka Shan - possibly a location name) yesterday. The "Regular Army" and "Guerrilla Force" groups played the main roles. The players of the Regular Army were all top players from this year's league, while the Guerrilla Force mostly consisted of retired veterans, each with their own history. Before the match, no one could predict which team would win. However, by the end of the match, the Regular Army ultimately "didn't lose" by a score of 1-0 (Chen Bingtu scored).</p>
<p>Li Huitang, the main player of the Guerrilla Force, was still recovering from a foot injury and attended the match on crutches as a spectator. The team lost its commander, which inevitably reduced its combat effectiveness. However, Ying Jie (Lin Yuying) and Wu Jinquan, who had retired for a long time, still put on a good performance, and their energy was quite sufficient. Returning to the field again, they still have potential. (Regular Army)</p>

<p>Before the match, Lu Aiyun, chairman of the Service Corps, thanked various sectors for their help in front of the microphone, saying that Xue Juexian had lent costumes for the last time and sent people to guide "face painting" (the costumed charity football match, with the big painted faces, old men, and "mamas" were realistically portrayed, and were apparently guided by a master.

<h3>Another Dramatic Battle for the Silver Shield: St. Joseph's Eliminates the Navy; Bidu's Attack Leads to a 3-2 Victory</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday was still the New Year holiday, and there were many battles in the football city. The Silver Shield Group A football match between St. Joseph's and the Navy was held at the Navy field.</p>
<p>Since St. Joseph's obtained大告山奴 (Da Gao Shan Nu), 比路度 (Bidu), 雷米 (Lei Mi) etc. to play for them again, their military power has greatly increased. Yesterday, when they encountered the Navy in the Silver Shield competition, everyone expected a dramatic battle. Therefore, there were one or two thousand Chinese and Western fans in the audience.</p>
<p>St. Joseph's victory this time was entirely due to their skill in using both wings as a vanguard, and they had many opportunities to attack from the flanks. Therefore, although they initially conceded two goals, because the two wings发挥 (fā huī – to bring into play) to their declarations and the three刺 (cì – to stab, thrust) were forceful, after tying the game, they added another goal to eliminate the Navy 3-2.</p>
<p>大告 (Da Gao) initially served as center forward, but he is near-sighted, and because the sunlight was dazzling, he soon switched to right inside forward, but his performance was not very good, but his momentum was fierce, enough to make the Navy defenders fear him.</p>
<p>Bidu is good at attacking, so he scored the third goal, and his skill in passing in the middle has returned to its original level. The frontline's ability to move constantly is largely due to his efforts.</p>
<p>Apart from the two goals conceded, 馬癸士 (Ma Guishi) only encountered dangerous shots three times, which proves that the defense was very solid. 吳德榮 (Wu Derong), 雷米迪 (Lei Miti), and 憂仙 (You Xian) all made good contributions.</p>
<p>The Navy's elimination was not a failure due to inferior skills but a failure to seize opportunities. The number of advances made by their frontline was no less than that of St. Joseph's, and they were faster. In the second half,岩士當 (Yan Shidang) and 懇地 (Ken Di) each approached the goal once and shot, but were saved by 馬癸士 (Ma Guishi). This obvious weakness is the failure to seize the opportunity to score.</p>
<p>The game was very tense. Shortly after the start, Navy center forward 鍾十 (Zhong Shi) broke through 沙 (Sha)'s defense and scored the first goal, opening the scoring. In the blink of an eye, 鍾士 (Zhong Shi) attacked again, taking advantage of a gap to break through another barrier. Seeing that the Navy was scoring so easily, everyone believed that victory would undoubtedly belong to the Navy.</p>
<p>However, the battle was most varied. Joseph was determined to recover lost ground and counterattacked fiercely. In less than five minutes, 李安納 (Li Anna) and 大告 (Da Gao) each scored a goal, tying the score. Counting both sides' gains and losses, less than fifteen minutes, it was really fast.</p>
<p>In the second half, the two sides attacked and defended each other, and the situation was tense. Although the Navy's attack was not weak, they failed to seize opportunities and missed the final shot at the goal, so they failed to score again.</p>
<p>Later, St. Joseph's seized the opportunity. 比路度 (Bidu) took advantage of 加士地路 (Jia Shidilu)'s corner kick and scored, creating a 3-2 victory. (Tai)</p>

<h3>Two Football Matches: From the End of the Year to the Beginning of the Year</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] On the last day of 1939, South China and Kowloon Club played a special Silver Shield Group A football match at Kowloon Club field. However, because this venue is traditionally unfavorable to the visiting team, especially to South China, which is good at short passes, although South China's skills and strength surpassed the opponent, they were unable to perform to their full potential on that field and were unable to control the team. After the official 70 minutes of play, they had not yet determined the winner, so they extended it by 20 minutes, but there were no gains or losses. The game ended 0-0, and they will have to replay it another day.</p>
<p>The advantage of South China's offensive strategy lies in its skillful and beautiful short passes. However, the reason why they were unable to win this time was that too many short passes was an undeniable drawback. It must be known that soldiers have no constant strategy, and water has no constant shape. The method of winning in battle has many variations, and football is the same. South China's frontline, playing on that small field, still stubbornly relied on the "single-minded" short passes, not knowing to adapt to the situation, so their advantage became a weakness and was broken by Kowloon's dense defense, to no avail. This proves that the exertion of strength is ultimately not as good as the use of the brain. South China's players had not really thought about the terrain and strategy beforehand, so they did not know how to act according to the circumstances during the game.</p>
<p>Although it can be excused that the players must make short passes to penetrate deeply before shooting because they are not confident in their shots, this field did not allow them to make short passes, so they had to find another way. However, they did not adapt to the situation, and repeatedly made short passes, inevitably leading to the ball being taken away by the opponent. Therefore, although they often occupied the offensive position, they had no effect. Until the extended time, they slightly changed their strategy and adopted more wing side attacks. However, Kowloon was the "local bully," and its performance was particularly outstanding, firmly adhering to its "closed-door policy." South China's forwards could do nothing.</p>
<p>The replay will be at加路連 (Jialu Lian). South China's forwards should be able to perform as they wish on their own field. The victory is believed to be South China's in the end. Moreover, they will also get an extra ticket revenue, which will be split evenly between the two families. This is an extra benefit after the draw.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, South China will play against Eastern at加山 (Ka Shan), also for the Silver Shield.</p>
<p>This game was still exciting in the first ten minutes or so, but after that it became a mess. The number of fouls was countless. "We are born of the same root, why are we so eager to fry each other?" I want to say nothing.</p>
<p>A glorious defeat is better than an unjust victory. This time, the two teams still drew, so there is no need to discuss right and wrong. But I think that if the referee for this game was not 柴九皋 (Chai Jiugao) but a foreigner, it would not have created such a terrible situation.</p>
<p>I must first declare that Mr. Ye's judgments in this game were extremely clear, his eyes were sharp enough, and there were no mistakes. However, because he is Chinese, the players on both sides do not respect him as much as they respect foreigners. Therefore, although Mr. Ye immediately blew his whistle to penalize any player who performed excessive behavior, they were not afraid at all, treating it as trivial, and committing the same offense again and again, even to the point of being penalized four or five times. There were also five or six people who were reprimanded by Mr. Ye in person, but they never knew how to change. After being penalized, they relapsed into their old habits, and eventually there was the incident of Li 碩友 (Li Shuoyou) being sent off the field.</p>
<p>The players on both sides do not respect Mr. 葉 (Ye), which means they do not respect their own people. It is admirable that Mr. Ye enforces the law like a mountain and handles things appropriately, but they always call Mr. 葉 (Ye) "local ginger is not spicy." This bad mentality despises personality, is ungrateful to Mr. 葉 (Ye), and is ungrateful to the audience.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, South China initially scored two goals (one was scored by 陳德 (Chen De) with a single-handed shot, and the other was scored by 李碩友 (Li Shuoyou) with a free kick), but then 林德 (Lin De) was injured, and both attack and defense were affected, so they were attacked forcefully by Eastern and fell into a bitter battle. Then 李德奇 (Li Deqi) took back a goal in the first half, and the situation in the second half was very bad. Almost as soon as the ball touched the person, it was fouled and penalized due to the competition. However, Eastern was unharmed and its offensive was at its peak. Then 德奇 (Deqi) pushed in a goal in the chaos, tying the score. After the 70 minutes were over, the score was 2-2, and the winner was not decided. In the extended time, there were no more records, and 李碩友 (Li Shuoyou) was sent off the field within the extra time.</p>
<p>Let's wait for the replay to see who will win, but hopefully it won't be as bad as this time. (Football Field Tai Sui (太歲 - mythical chinese deity))</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Club Loses After Hard Fighting: Eliminated by Police Club 2-3</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday's special Silver Shield Group A match between Hong Kong Club and Police Club met at the Hong Kong Club field. In terms of strength, they were evenly matched, and it was not easy to resolve the victory or defeat without a dramatic battle. However, in yesterday's game, Hong Kong Club's lineup was chaotic, and good players such as 福 (Fu) "Fat Shi (肥史)" were absent, weakening their combat power. Although they drew 2-2 in the first half, after the extended time, the Hong Kong Club generals' stamina was insufficient, and the entire army was exhausted, so they were eliminated by the Police Club with a score of 1-3.</p>
<p>This game was chaotic and unremarkable. The Police Club was stronger, so they could control the overall situation. However, the forwards lacked the skill of hitting the mark, so they could not steadily secure victory. The defense was changed to be headed by 柏架 (Bai Jia), but his ball skills were no longer what they used to be. His positioning was inappropriate, and he often gave 阜拉 (Fula) the opportunity to rush. The remaining four Chinese generals were decent, and their actions were civilized.</p>
<p>Because Hong Kong Club lacked good players, their strength was weakened, so they were naturally no match for the police. However, it was still difficult to score two goals first in the first half. All the soldiers have done their best. Yesterday's failure was because their strength was indeed inferior to others, and it was not a crime of war.</p>
<p>There were no games in Group B, and Group A started on time. Hong Kong Club deployed in a favorable wind, and the Police Club resisted against the wind, feeling twice as difficult. The ball came and went, not leaving the middle ground. After five minutes, 阜拉 (Fula) broke open a bloody path, passed it to 江興 (Jiang Xing), and cut in along the side. 衣史杜蘭 (Yi Shidulan) stepped forward to meet it and kicked it casually. The ball took advantage of the wind and landed in front of the goal, just bouncing off the goalpost and falling into the net. 埃健士 (Ai Jianshi) had no time to defend, and it was too late to rescue it. Hong Kong Club opened the scoring 1-0 first. The Police Club, after unexpectedly losing, felt unwilling and launched a chase. 麽士 (Moshi) led the three armies, and they went straight in a long line. 候律 (Hou Lu) twice used a header, but 高路士 (Gao Lusi) closed the door and thanked the guests, refusing to let it pass the net. 江興 (Jiang Xing) took a corner kick, but it was hooked out by 士堅拿 (Shi Jianna) with a big kick, and there was no gap to enter.</p>
<p>Before long, 派路 (Pailu)'s surprise soldier stood out and passed it with a big kick. 阜拉 (Fula) rushed through the siege like a wild boar, and 埃健士 (Ai Jianshi)'s welcome was too late. 阜拉 (Fula) came to the city and shot hard at the door, making another contribution. The first half ended with Hong Kong Club taking the lead 2-0.</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the Police Club had the wind and regained the advantage. The forwards surrounded the enemy's gate, and it was watertight. Hong Kong Club's defense fought back hard and temporarily solved the urgent problem of the knitted brow after struggling hard. However, after a long attack, they ran in vain, and their energy was insufficient. 花利亞 (Hualiya) took advantage of this gap, took one after another, shot in two goals, and snatched back a tie. At the end of the game, the score was tied 2-2.</p>
<p>After adding time to fight again, the Hong Kong Club generals were exhausted because they had worked hard to fight before, and their fighting spirit disappeared, so they were taken advantage of by the Police Club and controlled the overall situation. As a result, 黃文貴 (Huang Wengui) scored a goal and eliminated the Hong Kong Club with a score of 3-2. The lineup is as follows. (Gu Ben)</p>

<h3>Movie</h3>
<p>Entertainment… Golden Drums Rumble</p>
<p>Drums</p>
<p>A never-before-seen production from British Alexander Korda. The script tells the story of Prince Azim (Sabhu) seeking revenge for his father's murder. After Majula selflessly saves his life, Azim reports the secret of the "rebellion" to the governor when Prince Gore conspires to launch a major attack. He even helps by drumming, waiting for reinforcements to arrive and annihilate the rebellion.</p>
<p>There are two remarkable scenes in the performance. During the Saint's Day celebration, the palace is filled with jubilant celebrations, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for the uprising. This culminates in the start of the drumming. Following this, there is a climax where reinforcements arrive, and both sides engage in a fierce battle. With well-equipped facilities surpassing those abroad, capturing the scene vividly and naturally is an easy task. Several war scenes are very stimulating for the audience. The outdoor scenes are likely more beautiful because of the vibrant colors.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, "Sabhu" displays his endearing performance skills from "Elephant Boy," and remains excellent here. The female lead, Valerie Hobson, is a beautiful and skilled British star. Regarding "If I Were King," directed by Frank Lloyd, his previous works such as "Cavalcade" and "Mutiny on the Bounty" were all outstanding and successful films that left audiences with an unforgettable good impression. Critics have said that his recent work, "If I Were King," is a further step forward in success compared to the aforementioned works in every aspect.</p>
<p>The story is set in Paris during the reign of Louis XI of France, a time when the country faces strong external enemies and internal starvation. The central figure is a poet and swordsman who is also a rogue. He is an outstanding leader among the rioting masses. He unintentionally kills an enemy of Louis, and Louis, impressed by his bold words, grants him full authority to manage the country for a week. Within this time, he must drive the strong enemy out of the country, or he will face severe punishment. Relying on his courage and talent, and after immense struggles and efforts, he ultimately defeats the strong enemy and wins the heart of the princess.</p>
<p>The entire film is performed with grandeur and splendor, and all the characters are lively and vibrant. Among the main actors, Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Louis is particularly praiseworthy. The director has not treated the film too seriously. The entire film is filled with humor and amusing atmosphere. The story itself has a moving power. Coupled with the director's hard work, the excellent acting, the lively plot, the superb martial arts, and the classic costumes and sets, it is a flawless and successful work.</p>
<p>East… Hurricane</p>
<p>Hurricane</p>
<p>The story is touching, and the scene of the storm hitting the island is thrilling. The cast is well-matched, making it a good film.</p>
<p>Dahua… Studio Spring</p>
<p>She Married An Artist</p>
<p>A triangular love story that is rich in fun. The story tells of a female fashion expert who hastily marries a painter. The painter also has a lovely model who has been secretly in love with him for a long time. But the painter cannot paint without her, and that is how the drama unfolds.</p>
<p>The male lead, John Boles, is competent and cheerful. The female lead's performance is also good.</p>
<p>Central… The Four King Brothers</p>
<p>Mandarin Film</p>
<p>This is a remake of a silent film, converted into a sound film and colored. The scenes are grander than the silent film. Wang Yin replaces Wang Yuanlong from before. The female lead is Zhang Cuihong, who transitioned from the music scene to the film industry.</p>

<h3>Resistance and Sports</h3>
<p>— Li Hui</p>
<p>A few months ago, a leading figure in British athletics, Mr. Zeng Lianheng, issued a circular telegram to the people of the country, proclaiming the slogan "Expanding armaments is not as good as improving the national morality and spirit through sports." At that time, King George VI of England greatly praised this matter and made precise remarks on the radio, saying, "If every country can cultivate their minds and bodies through the proper path of sports, then from individuals, the social organization will be healthy, and various problems such as greed, cowardice, suspicion, selfishness, apathy, and cruelty can be eliminated, thereby making the country stronger and life never extinguished." Recently, Nazi Germany has also been practically promoting the "National Defense Sports" theory, establishing rules and vigorously implementing them, using sports to forge and promote the spirit of Greater Germany.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, by today, everyone understands that the sports industry has an extraordinary relationship with human life and with society and the country. Sports are simply the heart of a person, which must be constantly beating and cannot stop for a moment. The greatest advantages of sports are:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthening the body</p>
<p>(2) Promoting the virtue of obedience</p>
<p>(3) Encouraging the spirit of unity. In addition to the above three major points, sports can: 1. Enhance national consciousness; 2. Cultivate patriotic enthusiasm; 3. Instill the spirit of sacrifice; 4. Cultivate noble character; 5. Foster a sense of justice and martial spirit. Therefore, in modern sports, if we want to measure the strength of a country, we can almost estimate the quality of its sports achievements as a reliable standard. Talking about sports today, when the country is in deep trouble and the national situation is critical, seems very out of place on the surface. Many people will say, "The sports industry is a long-term plan, and now the flames are already burning our eyebrows, how can we spare any space to take care of it?" True, in today's full-scale war of resistance, military strength, financial resources, and military supplies seem to be the most urgent needs. However, if we have the great determination to resist the war for a long time, then whether it is treating the symptoms or the root cause, whether it is urgent or slow, I believe that the sports industry should be given even more attention and should not be neglected for a moment. May I ask, if the country has no healthy organization, how can it resist to the end? On the individual side, if there is no strong physique, how can one take on the task of national salvation? A healthy organization and a strong physique can only be obtained with certainty by following the proper path of sports, and cannot be obtained by luck. Tolstoy said it well, "Only in physical labor can one obtain health and promote the mutual unity of mankind."</p>
<p>The author is a small part of the sports community. Since the start of the War of Resistance, I am ashamed to have no military, rescue, or other specialized skills. I have no trace of my presence on the front lines, and even in the rear, due to various circumstances, I am ashamed that I cannot do more to help the country and cannot do more work that is beneficial to the War of Resistance, which makes me extremely uneasy and ashamed. I think many sports comrades in the rear will have the same feeling, the same pain, and the same regret. As far as I know, because there are not many people in the sports community who have a fundamental relationship with the military, there have been very few who have sacrificed their lives for the country in this war. Most of the people in the sports community are young and strong, and it can be considered a great shame that they still cannot contribute more to the work of defending the country at this time of crisis. I feel ashamed. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>US Reiterates Far East Policy, Does Not Recognize Results of Aggression, Notifies Japan of Reserved Rights, British View Same as US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The new note from the United States to Japan states that, based on past facts and experience, the United States government must reiterate the following views: that Japan's restrictions on the actions of American nationals in China place Japanese interests in a superior position, and that the legitimate interests of the United States will inevitably be discriminated against. The note mentions Japan's foreign exchange controls in China, forced currency circulation, tariff revisions, and controlled business operations, stating that these restrictive measures are extremely unfair and violate treaty provisions. The United States government and its people will never agree to any system established by a third country in China that deprives it of its long-established rights and the fundamental principles of equal opportunity and fair treatment. Principles such as equal opportunity cannot be abolished by unilateral actions. The note also firmly rejects Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia," stating that the United States reserves all its rights in China. Finally, the note declares that the United States is prepared to discuss amendments to treaties concerning China, but solemnly declares that the United States will not allow Japan to undermine the principles of the Open Door and equal opportunity. Authoritative sources claim that this will be the final note from the United States on the China issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, November 31st] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the recent note from the United States to Japan has attracted significant attention in London. Regarding the issue of British interests in China, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has held informal discussions with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. It is expected that Britain will not issue a note to Japan for the time being. Officials have not yet made any comments on the US note to Japan. However, observers believe that the approach adopted by Washington and the views expressed in the US note to Japan are in line with London's views and feelings.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Regarding maintaining the Open Door policy in China, US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, recently submitted a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. (Note: After the United States submitted a note to Japan on October 6th, Japan submitted a reply on November 18th, and this note from the United States is in response to Japan's reply.) The content briefly states that the actions and activities of American citizens in China have been restricted by the Japanese authorities, and that the advantages enjoyed by Japan have already placed it in a superior position. This discriminatory approach is unfair. It should be known that the legal position of the various countries concerned is stipulated in treaties. If Japan wishes to amend them, it can achieve its goal through international negotiations and normal procedures. However, Japan claims that it has the right to violate treaties based on a new order and a new situation, which is unacceptable to the US government. The new reality in China is caused by Japan. The conclusion is that if Japan can propose other suggestions to the other countries concerned, including China, the US and Chinese governments are prepared to discuss them. The venue should be jointly designated by the various countries concerned, and from this moment until that time, the US government should reserve all existing rights and not allow them to be changed. The most important point is that the legal position of the various countries in China can be revised based on the suggestions made by Japan. US diplomatic sources recently commented that this is an indirect proposal to convene an international conference. It is intended to remind Japan that the country participated in negotiations during the difficult situation in 1922, and the Nine-Power Treaty was born as a result. To this day, this procedure still needs to be adopted. However, according to the information received here, Japan is unwilling to hold an international conference. This note from the United States is not so much a new initiation for the Far East issue as it is a reiteration of the main principles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yangon, 1st] US Ambassador to China, Nelson Johnson, arrived here yesterday and is scheduled to fly to London today.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain and Others to Rome, Will Not Discuss French-Italian Issues, Visit Schedule Published, Meeting with Mussolini on the 11th</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Local officials have published the schedule for the visit of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax to Italy. The British Prime Minister and his entourage will arrive on the 11th and reside at the Villa Madama during their stay. They will first go to the Italian Royal Palace to sign the guest book there, and then visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Venice and attend the banquet held there that evening.

On the evening of the same day, a banquet will be held at the British Embassy, and they will depart from Rome on the 14th at noon to return to Britain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] The British side has provided assurances to the French government, stating that Prime Minister Chamberlain will refuse to discuss French-Italian issues and Mediterranean issues with the Italian side during his visit to Italy, and will only focus on the Spanish issue as the theme of the talks. Therefore, France's attitude is even more rigid, which can be seen in the comments of various parties. "Order" newspaper claims that France should learn a lesson from the recent experience and not be fooled again.</p>
<h3>French Premier Tours North Africa, Arrived in Toulon the Night Before, Transferred to Corsica, Meets with Naval Chief and Continues to Tunis</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] French Prime Minister Daladier took a train to Toulon today, marking the start of his tour of the Mediterranean colonies. His itinerary includes Corsica and Tunisia.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Toulon, 1st] French Prime Minister Daladier arrived here at 1:20 last night from Marseille on a special train. Military and political dignitaries and a large crowd of people stood at the station to greet him despite the late-night wind and cold. At midnight, the Prime Minister transferred to the cruiser Foch and went to Ajaccio on the west coast of Corsica. This is the birthplace of Napoleon, and then he will transfer to the military port of Bastia on the island to meet with the French Minister of the Navy. It is expected to arrive at 2:30 in the afternoon and continue to Tunis, North Africa, and arrive at the highest military port of Bizerte at 6:00.</p>
<p>[Haitong News, Paris] On Sunday morning, the French parliament passed the third reading of the 1939 budget by a vote of 372 to 209. French Prime Minister Daladier's delay in his tour of the North African colonies was only because he was waiting for the decision to be made. Before Daladier departed from Marseille, he had a long talk with Foreign Minister Bonnet at the station.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Aircraft Six Times More Than British and French, Statistics from US Army Experts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] According to statistics from experts at the US Army Department, at the time of the signing of the Munich Agreement, Germany and Italy had six times more aircraft than Britain and France. The experts said that Germany manufactured more than 1,000 aircraft in November of last year, while Britain could only manufacture 240 aircraft per month. Although the rate of manufacturing has now increased by two times, it is still only half of Germany's. The United States can manufacture an average of 350 aircraft per month, while the number of aircraft in France is far less than that in Italy. Germany's aircraft industry has 400,000 skilled workers, while the United States has 36,000.</p>
<h3>British Queen Catches Cold</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] It is learned that the Queen has a slight cold and is staying in Sandringham House to recuperate.</p>
<h3>Skoda Armaments Factory Not Bought by Germans</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 31st] It was previously reported that the Czechoslovakian Skoda armaments factory was purchased by the Krupp artillery factory, which is controlled by the German government. Reuters has now confirmed that this is not the case.</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Trade Relations Weak</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 1st] Economic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were at a low point last year. In January, German goods exported to the Soviet Union were worth only 21 million marks, and Soviet goods imported into Germany were worth about 35 million marks. In the previous year, from January to December, German goods exported to the Soviet Union were worth a total of 117 million marks, and Soviet goods imported into Germany were worth 65 million marks. A comparison shows the extent of the decline.</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Discuss New Year Prospects, Will Raise Colonial Demands, Still Attack US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] At midnight on New Year's Eve, Hitler, wearing a hat, stood in front of the door of his country villa and fired salutes as a New Year's start. Prior to this, villagers wearing Bavarian folk costumes sang the national anthem and dragged a small cannon up the mountain to fire it on time. Hitler shook hands with everyone and offered New Year's greetings. The "Berlin Local Newspaper" generally discussed Germany's New Year prospects, saying, "We still do not know what will happen this year, but we will still have demands, such as colonies." Also, the "German Times" stated, "The crime of the United States is not only that it is unfriendly to Germany, but also that it attacks Europe's national awakening."</p>
<h3>Soviet Automobile Expert Zegerlu Murdered</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] Zegerlu, a famous Soviet automobile builder, was murdered in his private residence. According to police, Zegerlu had been living in seclusion for a long time, researching new types of automobiles. Several suspects have been arrested.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Makes Long-Distance Flight to Australia</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd] The German light aircraft Alana 79 is making a long-distance flight to Australia. Yesterday, it flew continuously for 12 hours without stopping, directly to Bangkok, Siam.</p>
<h3>Crookshank Flies Back to London to Compile Berlin Talks Report, German Submarine Construction Plans Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British Foreign Office issued a statement on Germany's announcement of its decision to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain, stating, "Representatives of the British and German navies held a meeting at the German Ministry of the Navy on December 30 to express their opinions on the matter. The atmosphere of the talks was extremely friendly." A Reuters reporter stated that after the Berlin talks, there was no official news regarding Germany's decision, but there seems to be no reason to speculate that Germany has changed its intention to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain. Rear Admiral Crookshank, head of the British delegation, has now flown back to London to prepare a report to be submitted to the Foreign Office, Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Halifax. Both of them are currently on vacation in Yorkshire. A naval correspondent for the "Sunday Times" discussed the Berlin negotiations, stating, "Germany can have more than twice as many small submarines as Britain in terms of quantity. Germany currently has more submarines than Britain. The ratio of submarines between the two countries is 69 to 72, but the tonnage of German submarines is only 45 percent of Britain's, because most German submarines are small, while British submarines are equipped to travel anywhere in the world and are mostly large. This does not mean that German submarines are purely coastal vessels."</p>
<p>French Newspaper Observations</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The newspapers here are criticizing Germany's demand to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain. The general opinion is that Germany intends to aid Italy, because submarines can enter the Mediterranean Sea more easily than surface ships. Moreover, submarines can be used to break future blockades and hinder British shipping. "Le Figaro" newspaper stated, "Germany is now building a large number of small submarines, which can be hidden in the North Sea and the English Channel, while its naval power is currently building large submarines." The general opinion of the newspapers is that this move by Germany will cause Britain to feel that its maritime hegemony is in danger and threatened. "Industrial News" stated, "The result of this move by Germany will inevitably make Britain even more opposed to authoritarianism. This is not appropriate for Italy, because Italy is now hoping to use British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Italy to obtain concessions from France."</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy to Discuss Economic Cooperation, German Economy Minister Funk to Arrive in Rome on the 7th in Response to Invitation</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd] German Economy Minister Funk is currently vacationing in Sicily, southern Italy. It is reported that on his way back to Germany, he will make an official visit to Rome. According to the Italian National Daily, Funk's visit to the Italian capital is to reciprocate the invitation from Italian Minister of Corporations Lantini to Germany. Funk is expected to arrive in Rome on the 7th of this month and stay for three days on official business. It is reported that the future talks in the Italian capital will be about various issues of economic cooperation between Germany and Italy.</p>
<h3>US Silver Purchase Price Will Not Change This Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 31st] US President Roosevelt announced today that the price at which the US Treasury Department purchases newly produced domestic silver in 1939 will not change. He also announced that the country's silver purchase program would be extended to the 1939 fiscal year, so the price of newly produced silver will remain at 64.64 pence per ounce. The president also stipulated that newly produced silver must be delivered to the mint by the end of June. If Congress does not reauthorize it by then, the president's power to set the silver price by proclamation will cease. Members of Congress from silver-producing states have asked the president not to lower the price of silver, saying that this would cause miners to lose their jobs.</p>
<h3>US Army Department Purchases Special Machines, Preparing to Equip Shells and Make Gunpowder</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] US Army Chief of Ordnance Major General Wesson published an article in the "Army Ordnance," stating that the US Army Department has decided to allocate $33.5 million to purchase special machines. These machines will be located in newly built munitions factories in the interior of the country, and will be used to equip shells and make gunpowder in times of emergency.</p>
<h3>German Issues Decree, Specifying Deadline for Raw Material Distribution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, December 31st] The German Official Gazette published several decrees, specifying the deadline for the distribution of various raw materials, from December to the 15th of the month. These raw materials include various metals, sesame, hemp, and tires. Typewriters, radios, automobiles, and other industries are all affected by this new decree.</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Aircraft Fiercely Attack Barcelona, Valencia Also Suffers Heavy Bombing</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Barcelona, 1st] The Spanish government officially received French Ambassador Henry today. Coincidentally, rebel aircraft came to bomb, so the French Ambassador was escorted by government guards to a safe place amidst the sound of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. All the ceremonies proceeded as usual and were not hindered. It was found that the air raid killed five people and injured nine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Valencia, 31st] The ship "Milu Panu" was bombed by rebel aircraft, avoiding serious losses. This was the third dangerous incident encountered by the ship this week. At that time, rebel aircraft carried out fierce bombing, dropping more than 50 bombs. Fragments of bamboo bombs fell on the superstructure of the "Milu Panu." At the same time, according to reports from Barcelona, 30 people were killed and 80 injured in the bombing here today.</p>
<h3>Anxious About War, Soviet Newspaper Comments on Konoe Declaration, Clumsy Methods Not Enough to Deceive People</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, February 31st] Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's declaration on December 22 regarding the principles of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations has aroused fierce criticism from the "Izvestia" newspaper here. The newspaper infers two points from this: 1. Japan's purpose is to completely conquer China; 2. Japanese military leaders are no longer anxious about the outcome of the war. Because Japan is anxious about the outcome of the war, it wants to try to negotiate with the pro-Japanese elements in China. The declaration also targets foreign forces (the purpose of Japan's operation is to target foreign interests). But in this regard, the declaration is also a clumsy method, because it is not enough to deceive anyone. As for Japan's preparation to abolish extraterritoriality, it indicates its intention to completely control China.</p>

<h3>On Construction Projects in the War of Resistance and Nation-Building</h3>
<p>— Chen Cheng</p>
<p>This article is based on my speech to the cadre training corps students on the front lines of Biaoyang on October 17th last year. The intention was to explain that the War of Resistance is a means, and nation-building is the goal. Therefore, the current war is merely a means to achieve the goal of national revolution and nation-building. In order to win the war, we must strengthen our resistance efforts, and while fighting, we must also engage in construction, especially active national assistance construction, so that we can complete the arduous work of the War of Resistance as soon as possible. Now, as the new year begins, and a new page in the history of national rejuvenation is unfolded, it is time for us to encourage self-reflection, intensify mobilization, and strive for construction in the rear. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." Therefore, I am raising the issue of construction as a New Year's message, hoping to provide a reference for the people of the country to devote themselves to construction in the future, so that construction and revolutionary affairs can be coordinated, and the War of Resistance and nation-building can proceed simultaneously. Then, the great cause of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People can be achieved and witnessed!</p>
<p>Respectfully written by Chen Cheng</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>(1) The Meaning of Construction. (2) The Content of Construction. (3) The People's Livelihood Problem and People's Livelihood Construction. (4) Production Construction and National Defense Construction. (5) Unified Control and Management of Construction. (6) Construction and Education.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>During our arduous War of Resistance, many people have been asking about construction, and everyone is paying attention to this issue, which is a good phenomenon. However, many disputes have arisen in their discussions, with each side insisting on their own views and no consensus being reached. This situation directly and indirectly reduces the strength of construction and affects the future of the War of Resistance. Therefore, today I am putting forward my personal views on this issue for everyone to study.</p>
<p>In my opinion, most of the disputes that everyone has generated are due to errors in research principles. Therefore, before entering the main topic, I must first talk about the basic principles of studying social problems:</p>
<p>Society is developing forward without hesitation. The relationships between people in society are becoming closer day by day. These interconnected relationships constitute the social whole. Therefore, the entire society is directly and indirectly linked to each other. For example, the Sino-Japanese War can directly affect the economies and financial markets of various countries in the world, and indirectly affect local prices, and even affect the daily lives of individuals. This is like throwing a stone into a pond; its ripples can gradually spread to the entire surface of the water. Although the size of the ripples varies depending on the distance, it is impossible to be unaffected. What is the reason for this? It is because the surface of the water is a whole, and every molecule of water is connected to each other. Society is even more so; therefore, when studying any social problem, we cannot forget the relationships between all aspects. A one-sided, partial, and isolated study will not easily lead to correct conclusions. For example, in the case of the army, only when senior officers, middle-ranking officers, junior soldiers, and even weapons and equipment have appropriate and sound organizational coordination can they exert great combat effectiveness. Any deficiency in any part is enough to affect combat power. In this War of Resistance, most people know the importance of senior generals, but are soldiers not in an equally important position? It's just that they each have different duties, like the five senses and four limbs of the human body, none of which can be missing. If you understand this principle, then those who sell chili peppers don't have to say that vinegar is also spicy; and those who sell vinegar don't have to insist that chili peppers are also sour.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is important to know that society is continuously developing. Society has never died, and therefore its development has never been interrupted. The history of the development of this entire human society constitutes extremely complex causal relationships—as if without yesterday, there would be no today, and with today, there must be a tomorrow. Today's capitalist society was born from the womb of feudal society. At the same time, due to the many contradictions within today's capitalist society, a utopian society will inevitably emerge in the future. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen's idea of a world commonwealth does not come from nowhere, but is produced based on the historical evolution and objective reality. To be clearer, it was because of the backwardness of Chinese society that the active aggression of Japanese imperialism was triggered, which created the current great War of Resistance. Furthermore, it is because of the concerted efforts of the entire country that the powerful factors for final victory and national liberation have been formed. From this, of course, we can further seek why Chinese society has fallen behind and why Japanese imperialism must expand outward. Although these questions take a long time to explain, this method and principle are indeed the only way to solve the problem. The so-called "things have roots and branches" is this principle. If we sever the past and future in our research, without searching for its source and future development, the result will only be knowing one thing but not knowing the other?</p>
<p>(1) The Meaning of Construction</p>
<p>In the process of human social evolution, it often contains two opposing components. Some people represent the interests of the whole society and help society develop forward; some people, for personal interests, do not hesitate to harm the interests of the whole and hinder the development of society, even pulling society backward. The meaning of revolution is to promote society to progress forward in order to seek the happiness and well-being of all mankind. That is to say, to move towards a rational society. In order to achieve this goal, revolution must adopt two necessary methods. On the one hand, the reactionary forces and facilities that hinder social progress must be destroyed as much as possible in order to create favorable conditions for construction and ensure the rapid development of the revolution. On the other hand, the various requirements of the new society must be actively built in order to consolidate the true foundation of the revolution, to thoroughly destroy the revolutionary reactionary forces, and to achieve the true purpose of the revolution. Therefore, construction and destruction are in an equally important position in the revolutionary sense, but most people pay attention to destruction and often ignore construction, which is a great mistake. We can also see that in the "Declaration of the Outline of National Construction" thirteen years ago, it was stated that "The Outline of National Construction begins with clearing obstacles and ends with completing construction. Revolution is an extraordinary destruction, so there must be extraordinary construction to follow it." This has long designated the importance of construction in the revolution. In order to promote the progress of Chinese society, Sun Yat-sen led the revolution with great spirit, and carried out more than ten fierce struggles against the corrupt and unsustainable Manchu Qing regime and autocratic political system, and finally achieved the success of the Xinhai Revolution. Since the Republic of China, he has fought decisively against the Northern Warlords, who were the remnants of feudalism. All his efforts were nothing more than using revolutionary forces to clear the obstacles to construction in order to bring about a new society as soon as possible. He personally drafted important plans such as the "Outline of National Construction," which was evidence of his desire to build a new China. Sun Yat-sen said: "In the future, the revolution should continue the unfinished cause of the Xinhai Revolution, and vigorously correct its mistakes. That is, in the future, the revolution should not only focus on destruction, but also on construction." This shows his attention to construction. The leader, following Sun Yat-sen's legacy, leads the revolution, creating a unified situation unique in history, and striving for various construction works. Recently, he launched the nation's human and material resources into a life-and-death battle with Japanese imperialism, which is hindering our nation's independence and ethnic survival. However, after the July 7th Incident, he put forward the slogan of "National Construction Movement" at Mount Lu, pointing out the path to national construction. The declaration of the Provisional National Congress also stated: "We should do our utmost to strive for the survival and independence of the nation and the country, and at the same time, based on the Three Principles of the People, continue to complete the political and economic construction, so that China can enjoy freedom and equality in the world." It also stated: "If there is no War of Resistance, the survival and independence of the nation cannot be guaranteed, and there will be no way to carry out the great cause of nation-building. And without nation-building, self-reliance cannot be sufficient, and how can we defend against foreign aggression and seek final victory." Therefore, today's War of Resistance means resisting aggression and removing obstacles to building a new China, which is completely the same meaning as overthrowing the Manchu Qing, overthrowing the warlords, and eliminating feudal remnants in the past.</p>
<p>Secondly, reactionary forces often use the excuse of construction to paralyze the people and achieve their goal of destroying the revolution. From the restoration of Zhang Xun and Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne in the distant past, to the Japanese invaders' creation of puppet regimes in the near past, they are all like this. We must know that construction must stand under the banner of revolution to have progressive significance. Counter-revolutionary construction is nothing more than creating a reactionary situation and making society forever remain in an unreasonable state. The Japanese invaders' construction of puppet regimes is to make our country forever fall into a colony, and to make us live a life of slavery like cattle and horses. And our construction is precisely to build a new society on the other side of this sea of suffering, to make China an independent, free, and happy country. Everyone only needs to pay attention to this point, and they will not be able to tell right from wrong and go astray.</p>
<p>(2) The Content of Construction</p>
<p>Building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People is our overall goal of revolution. In more detail, our construction must move in the direction of national independence, equality of civil rights, and people's livelihood and happiness, so as to achieve China's equal international status, equal political status, and equal economic status, so that China can permanently survive in the world. In order to achieve these goals, Sun Yat-sen divided the nature of construction into three departments in the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction": psychological construction, material construction, and social construction. The leader further carried forward Sun Yat-sen's legacy, and summarized Sun Yat-sen's legacy on government organization and local autonomy into political construction, and supplemented military construction as military construction, completing the five major departments of construction.</p>
<p>1. Psychological construction refers to Sun Yat-sen's philosophy. The essence contained in it is to vigorously refute the absurd theory of "knowing is easy, doing is difficult" that has existed for thousands of years, because the influence of this theory has made the people of the whole country, and even revolutionary comrades, fall into a state of "difficulty in acting" and unable to believe in words and deeds. The revolutionary spirit is completely lost. The consequences of this malpractice are truly as Sun Yat-sen said, a hundred times more than the Manchu Qing. The change of this decadent psychology is equivalent to the injection of the revolutionary soul. With this revolutionary soul, any powerful reactionary force will not shake our revolutionary spirit in the slightest. The leader expanded its scope, promoted the spirit of "wisdom, benevolence, and courage," and completed the actual spiritual construction, inspiring loyalty, promoting righteousness, and saving the country from danger and restoring the nation.</p>
<p>2. Material construction refers to Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan." The "Industrial Plan" is the most magnificent part of Sun Yat-sen's construction. The real social development is the greater conquest of nature by mankind and the full utilization of materials. China is vast and rich in resources, and its natural resources are particularly abundant. The reason why it is behind others is that it has not been explored and utilized, and the goods are abandoned on the ground, which is truly regrettable. If we can implement Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan," then the economy will develop, the people's livelihood will be prosperous, and the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation will be easily solved, and of course, it can become a rich, strong, and peaceful new country. What should be paid more attention to is what the leader said, "The 'Industrial Plan' is actually a great national defense plan." Sun Yat-sen had deep foresight and planned for the long-term peace and stability of the country and the nation. Unfortunately, we did not earnestly follow it, giving the Japanese invaders the opportunity to invade violently. Looking back, it is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>3. Social construction refers to the "Elementary Principles of Civil Rights." On the surface, it is nothing more than explaining the form and order of meetings. In fact, it contains two special meanings: 1. "Cultivating the organizational ability of the people." We know the greatness of mechanical power because it is based on a certain organization and cooperation. If each part is disassembled, it is just some fragments of steel. Everything is like this, let alone human beings. We call ourselves numerous in population, but if we don't add a certain organization, it will be like the past when we faced the enemy as a disorganized mass. Even if there are several times more of us, I'm afraid it won't have any effect. If every citizen is accustomed to Sun Yat-sen's "Elementary Principles of Civil Rights," develops a habit of organization, and mobilizes the people of the whole country, uniting 400 million people as one, it can be said that everything has a solution. 2. Cultivate the people's ability to use political power. The ultimate goal of the Principle of Democracy is to enable the people to manage politics and realize a truly democratic country, but if the people do not have the ability to manage, they are often used by a few people to seek personal gain, and the harm is even more unimaginable. Sun Yat-sen not only wanted to return political power to the people, but also taught the people how to use political power, which can be said to be the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness.</p>
<p>4. Political construction, as explained by the leader, refers to "actual things within the scope of ordinary politics, especially the construction and operation of national political institutions." This means improving political institutions and making the people's self-defense organizations sound. At present, it means improving people's lives and mobilizing all forces with the military as the center to consolidate our political foundation in the War of Resistance. Especially for the lazy, faint-hearted, greedy, and corrupt officials, they must be thoroughly eradicated. Speaking of the Five-Power Constitution, it is, as the leader said, "the ideal system to be built by political construction," which is also the ultimate goal of political construction.</p>
<p>5. Military construction is military construction, which is to develop military strength and create national defense forces to eliminate obstacles internally and maintain the independence and equality of the country and the nation externally. Therefore, the military force mentioned here is a revolutionary military force, which is to take on revolutionary undertakings, and is not used as a private tool as in the warlord era. As I have said, the main purpose of building an army is to transform the military force of individuals and groups into the military force of the country and the nation, to transform weak military forces into strong military forces, and to transform a small number of military forces into a large number of military forces, uniting them into one. Under the unified leadership of the leader, we sacrifice for the War of Resistance and for the cause. With sufficient military construction, all practical construction will be effectively guaranteed. Especially in today's national arms race, where the weak are prey to the strong, military construction is even more urgent and important.</p>
<p>The reason why we have elaborated on the five departments of construction here is to make everyone aware of the wholeness of construction and not to ignore one aspect at will, becoming a deformed construction. Because people often only invite one principle of democracy, losing the original meaning of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, but at the same time, they ignore the special importance of the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, which is a great danger. Below we will go on to explain this point.</p>
<p>(3) The People's Livelihood Problem and People's Livelihood Construction</p>
<p>"The primary task of construction is the people's livelihood." This is an important instruction that Sun Yat-sen left us—the leader explained the importance of people's livelihood construction in the Three Principles of the People, saying: "The Principle of Nationalism is to support the independence of the country and the nation, which is to eliminate the obstacles to the people's livelihood. The Principle of Democracy is to build the power of the people, which is to enable the people themselves to solve the problem of the people's livelihood." According to Sun Yat-sen's meaning, "People's livelihood is the people's life, the survival of society, the people's livelihood (which can also be said to be the country's livelihood), and the life of the masses (nation)." What is most important is the people's life. As everyone can understand from the name, as long as the people's life is properly solved, then the society's survival, the country's livelihood, and the life of the masses will naturally be solved easily. The occurrence of all problems in society and the most difficult problems to solve in human history are the root cause of all problems in the people's livelihood problem, which is also the only reason why Sun Yat-sen extremely valued it and listed it as the central problem of the Three Principles of the People. We must follow Sun Yat-sen's will and build a new society based on the Three Principles of the People, and we have to devote ourselves to the construction of the people's livelihood. At the same time, all construction is based on the construction of the people's livelihood as the main basis.</p>
<p>All human economic activities are nothing more than the four major needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. These four major practical life problems constitute the main content of the people's livelihood problems. The source of fulfilling these practical needs, of course, exists in the natural world. Therefore, human beings are constantly seeking to conquer and utilize nature in order to meet their living requirements. The meaning of a backward society is that everything is backward, but the main thing is that its production is backward, that is, its power to conquer and utilize nature is relatively weak, so its practical life requirements cannot be better satisfied. Logically speaking, the more developed the production and the more prosperous the society, the more human practical life can be better satisfied, so human beings do not have to study other problems, just strive to develop production. But in reality, this is not the case, because the social system makes the means of production, capital, and production tools concentrated in the hands of a few people, who do not engage in labor, but specialize in exploiting the surplus value of others and living a luxurious life. At the same time, the majority of people who work hard every day cannot maintain the minimum standard of living, forming a huge contradiction in society. This kind of social development is only beneficial to a few people, forming an unreasonable situation of those who work having no food and those who do not work having food, directly affecting the development of production. Sun Yat-sen recognized that Chinese society is a backward society in production. If we want the people to live comfortably, we must work hard to promote production construction. At the same time, he saw clearly the malpractices of social development in advanced countries and came up with a reasonable solution: 1. Implement equal land ownership to eliminate the phenomenon of annexation and encroachment by the elite in society and achieve the goal of farmers owning their land; 2. Restrain capital, advocate protecting private enterprises on the one hand to seek rapid development of production, and at the same time restrict private capital so that it does not manipulate the people's livelihood to endanger the lives of the majority of people; 3. Promote labor-capital cooperation, eliminate the problems that hinder production due to labor-capital conflicts, and make both parties cooperate under the highest interests of the country and the nation to accelerate production; 4. Develop state capital, so that all enterprises that are not suitable for private operation or that private individuals cannot operate should be operated by the state, and the operating rights of the central government and local governments should also be divided according to certain standards; 5. The government and the people should cooperate to solve the problems of production and distribution, so that the social economy has a certain track and order. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen's greatness lies not only in striving for construction to solve the people's livelihood problems, but also in paying attention to the improvement of the social system so that it does not hinder production construction, not only paying attention to production problems, but also paying attention to distribution problems, not only knowing the general contradictory phenomena in advanced countries, but also paying attention to the special backwardness of Chinese society, not only caring about the current problems, but also paying attention to preventing future malpractices. The leader further advocated the National Economic Construction Movement based on Sun Yat-sen's basic principles as an initial realization of the construction of the people's livelihood, in order to achieve the great goal of making the best use of people's talents, making the best use of land, making the best use of things, and making the best use of everything, and then to complete the highest ideal of a world commonwealth.</p>
<p>(4) Peaceful Construction and National Defense Construction</p>
<p>Society cannot have a major death or interruption, and production cannot be stopped or interrupted for a single day. The meaning of production construction is that all construction related to the people's lives and promoting the interests of the people's lives can be included. Therefore, it is more broadly referred to as economic construction by the general public. Sun Yat-sen's production construction is mostly contained in the construction of the people's livelihood, so understanding Sun Yat-sen's construction of the people's livelihood will allow a general understanding of the direction of China's production construction. What we should especially mention here is national defense construction. Although national defense construction and military construction are closely related, they are not the same. The former's scope is obviously much larger than the latter. All construction related to the existence and independence of the country and the nation can be called national defense construction, and is not limited to military construction alone. However, military construction is indeed the most essential and necessary construction in national defense construction. The leader believes that military force is one of the lives of the country, and we can know its importance. Speaking of national defense construction, Sun Yat-sen noticed this problem a long time ago. For example, the "Industrial Plan" implies a great significance of national defense planning, such as the opening up of rivers and seaports, the construction of railway networks, and the construction of coal, iron, mines, steelmaking machinery, and other ordnance factories, all of which are centered on the needs of national defense. The leader said to the training of military personnel: "If we don't thoroughly study the 'Industrial Plan,' we can't be considered to understand military affairs, and we are not qualified to talk about national defense." Unfortunately, for more than ten years, we have been limited by special circumstances, and the people of the country have not paid much attention, focusing only on the construction of the people's livelihood, and regarding the construction of the people's livelihood as ordinary economic construction, ignoring the importance of the military industry, emphasizing light industry over heavy industry, so that the manufacture of military supplies such as power and chemistry, and even the supplies and materials for wartime vehicles, cannot meet the requirements of self-sufficiency. If we can understand the importance of the existence of the country, we will know the importance of national defense construction even more. In a society where international boundaries still exist, especially today when the great powers are watching with covetous eyes, the importance of national defense construction really exceeds that of general production construction. Without national defense, there is no country. Without a country, what is there to talk about production construction! To be honest, the reason why we are suffering from the unreasonable devastation of tyranny today is because we had no national defense construction in the past. For example, many factories are built in large ports along the rivers and seas. In this war situation, the coastal areas have long become war zones, and our factories and industries have suffered great losses. A certain expert in national defense economics from Germany, after inspecting China, once told me that China's transportation construction is built from the outside to the inside, and many control points and transportation centers completely facilitate the enemy's invasion of us. These words make a lot of sense, which can prove that our past construction not only did not involve national defense construction, but was harmful to national defense. If we had paid attention to this, not only would these losses not have occurred, but our current weapons would also be enriched a hundredfold. We are by no means not paying attention to general production construction, but at this stage, we should focus on national defense construction. Only with the success of national defense construction can we achieve the national revolution's task of seeking freedom and equality for the country and the nation and guarantee the smooth development of production construction. Now, we have personally experienced the actual lessons. If we still stick to the old tune of general production construction without change, we are really ignorant of the priorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the mutual relationship between national defense construction and various production departments, I have said that society is a whole, so production is not carried out in isolation. The so-called national defense construction means that it is centered on national defense, and does not mean that it ignores all other construction. Various production departments related to national defense construction must also be established to achieve the goal of everything for national defense. For example, military-related production is mostly heavy industry, but its main raw materials are coal and iron, so it is also related to the development of the mining industry. The manufacture of gunpowder requires cotton, and as a result, it is also involved in the scope of agricultural production. For these, if they are not carried out simultaneously, national defense construction will still not succeed.</p>
<p>(5) Unified System and Management of Construction</p>
<p>In today's capitalist socialist society, production relations have already turned the whole world into one. The production and construction of various countries are striving for unification in order to improve their production efficiency. The production methods of the feudal era are no longer applicable today. In the past, some provinces could not follow the unified national methods to promote construction, and instead formed independent systems, each building their own way, advocating local products of the province and resisting national goods from other provinces, which reduced the scope of circulation of national goods and fundamentally violated Sun Yat-sen's principle of smooth flow of goods, and implemented a provincial relationship doctrine, failing to see the overall connection of production. For example, on a national scale, due to the convenience of natural terrain and artificial raw materials, some places are suitable for the construction of heavy industry, while others are suitable for the construction of light industry due to special circumstances. The country needs a particularly large amount of certain physical objects and must produce them in large quantities. The production of certain goods must be limited to a certain quantity. This way, the country can be appropriately allocated for construction, and statistics can be made on the production quantity and raw material distribution of the whole country, so that each production department can have a certain connection and appropriate development, without a sense of excess or deficiency, to promote the national construction cause. This result of large-scale division of labor and cooperation across the country will surely achieve unexpected success. But this requires a unified national situation and a complete planning system to achieve this goal. It is important to know that each local area building behind closed doors is the most uneconomical thing, because if all provinces in the country implement their own construction, it will form twenty or so construction units, resulting in the production of things that are not suitable for production, and the smooth flow of things that are suitable for production cannot be carried out. Many efforts and materials are mutually offset, so how can there not be a reason for failure?</p>
<p>Unified control and management are connected things. Only after unification can we talk about control and management. What is commonly referred to as control mostly refers to the management power of the national government. Controlling production and construction means having a certain plan and certain steps for production and construction, opposing blind production and construction, and making production and construction proceed reasonably under a predetermined purpose, so as not to have the slightest waste or consumption. From this, we can see that the only premise of control is unification. After unification, we must immediately implement control so that the national construction cause can proceed very economically. For example, in the industrial circles of various countries, whether it is machinery or even screws, they are all unified throughout the country. As long as they are screws of the same number and size, whether it is a machine or a cannon, they can be used, which invisibly increases many conveniences. Some factories that usually manufacture toys can immediately be converted into factories that manufacture military supplies in times of war. These are all the results of following a certain profound plan during construction. It is the same intention as Sun Yat-sen's idea of embedding national defense construction in the industrial plan. Today, when resisting tyranny and striving to implement national defense construction, we should implement control and carry out construction according to a certain plan.</p>
<p>The meaning of management generally refers to the management of the factory itself, with the intention of reducing waste, reducing production costs, and increasing the production efficiency of manufactured products. The European Tailor provided scientific management, which made factory production proceed under the principle of special economy, so the industrial circles of various countries followed suit and are still striving for precise management. It is said that Japan's largest Yawata Steel Plant, in order to calculate how much toilet paper is needed every day, the factory authorities even specially sent commissioners to sit in the toilet to investigate the number of people in order to ensure an appropriate supply. I used to visit the construction of Shanxi, and I had detailed inquiries about various departments. As a result, I found that the biggest weakness was that they could not implement precise scientific management, use labor and raw materials in the most economical way, so that production costs could not be reduced to the minimum, so that prices were more expensive and could not defeat others in the market. The leader paid special attention to the word "management" in the national construction movement, believing that in order to achieve the goal of "no waste of time, no wasteland, no waste of materials" in the future, strict management must be implemented. Now we are building the country in difficult and difficult times, and we should pay special attention to management.</p>
<p>Six Construction and Education</p>
<p>What we have just said is to take national defense construction as the center and promote all construction undertakings in order to achieve the great goal of the entire country. However, the main driving force for this construction still exists in education. The leader believes that education is one of the three major lives of the country, which shows its importance to all undertakings. What we are talking about now is only the educational matters that are directly related to construction and must be done.</p>
<p>The current education should first pay attention to the cultivation of construction personnel. Everyone knows that construction is the greatest work, and it is not something that can be done by a certain person or a certain group of people alone. We must use the strength of everyone in the country and carry it out jointly under the principle of division of labor and cooperation. That is, we must use the total national mobilization to promote the intention of construction. Dunxiu explained in the summary of the National Economic Construction All-People Movement that "we must unite the sincerity of the people across the country, unite the full strength of farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and work towards the same goal with a spirit of no distinction between each other and methods of division of labor and cooperation." Therefore, we must use the inherent spirit of "wisdom, faith, benevolence, and courage" and the power of educational propaganda to make the people of the whole country understand that construction is in the same important position in the country and the nation as the War of Resistance. His relationship with each individual's interests is very close; his future is bright and great. The special significance of national defense construction at the present stage lies in enlightening the nation's confidence in construction, so that people can resolutely shoulder the task of national defense construction in order to complete the great goal of the War of Resistance and nation-building. This kind of education can lay the foundation for mobilizing the people and create a tense atmosphere of national construction. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of "revolution first revolution" is especially needed today.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the training of specialized technical personnel. The bad habits of education in our country for many years have been that it has not created real specialized talents. The talents that have been created are those who can do everything and do nothing well. The reason for this is naturally that the country has not embarked on the road of construction. Even if there are some specialized talents, most of them cannot find suitable jobs, and they are useless in learning, which affects the people who study and develop a sense of versatility and are unwilling to specialize in research. Some people, even if they find a job, cannot do it well because their research is not deep enough, and they have the psychology of seeking easy success. At the same time, schools do not pay attention to practice and the actual needs of society when training, which leads to the development of useless talents who can talk but cannot do, and can do but cannot use. In addition, the place of employment cannot adopt the principle of talent, and what is used is nothing more than relatives and friends who are not talented. Therefore, people who study are even more unwilling to study in depth. This situation is too much of a loss to the country. Since we will need specialized construction talents in the future, and we must pay attention to training specialized construction talents, we must vigorously break the various barriers and malpractices above.</p>
<p>Primary and secondary school education should also strive to cultivate national concepts, because primary school students will be the masters of China in the future, and the future revolutionary task of building the country will be entirely on their shoulders. If we want them to be able to shoulder the task of building the country, we cannot allow them to waste the slightest effort in time.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion—Self-Reliance</p>
<p>Since we are here to talk about construction, we must first understand the overall meaning and consistent system of construction, so as to avoid the problem of treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts, or even treating the foot when the head hurts and treating the head when the foot hurts, and getting into a mess and not finding the main points. However, although I know that construction is an important part of the revolution, and the construction of people's livelihood is the center of all construction, national defense construction is in an especially important position, unified planning management is also the key point of construction, and education is the main driving force of construction, there is still one basic principle that must be followed, which is especially worthy of attention in our country today, which is "self-reliance."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a country that does not seek independence and relies solely on others will hardly stand in the world for a long time. The painful experience of Abyssinia and the practical lessons of Czechoslovakia have clearly told us this. Sun Yat-sen mentioned the source of construction capital in the "Industrial Plan," advocating attracting foreign investment, but also paying attention to maintaining sovereignty in our own hands, and advocating the use of international capital to prevent any country from controlling our lifeline with its superior economic power and losing our autonomy. The leader further said, "The purpose of my recent promotion of the National Economic Construction Movement is to promote the concerted efforts of the people to develop production and complete the construction of the entire national economy with their own strength. This is the most reliable way. If you don't work hard yourself, relying solely on others is hopeless. ... You must seek survival through self-reliance, and you can stand upright only if you can become strong." This principle of self-reliance has been said in the most sincere way. Although our country is poor and weak and has suffered unprecedented difficulties in history, if our country, both above and below, has the confidence of "self-help and others help," and exerts the great strength that we have, to "do solid work, do hard work, and do quick work," while resisting the war and building the country, the successful realization of the new China of the Three Principles of the People will certainly not be far away.</p>

<h3>After Wang Jingwei's Betrayal</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei's treacherous conduct has now been fully confirmed. At the Provisional Joint Conference of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees on New Year's Day afternoon, it was unanimously resolved to permanently expel Wang from the party and remove him from all official duties due to his solicitation of the enemy to seek surrender, gross violation of discipline, and endangerment of the party and the nation. It is truly a disgrace to the nation and its people that Wang, as a prominent leader of the party and the nation, would stoop so low as to become a national traitor. However, this action by the Central Government demonstrates the strict discipline of the nation and unprecedented progress in politics. Henceforth, pro-Japanese traitors will have no support to rely on, and turncoats will have no room for activity. The government's authority will be greatly enhanced, and the nation will move towards unification. This may very well be the first good news of the 28th year!</p>
<p>Judging from reliable sources, Wang's act of betrayal was not accidental. Before leaving Chongqing, Wang attempted to win over certain wavering elements to control the Fifth Plenary Session; to instigate an anti-communist and armistice movement; and even Konoe's declaration to China had been reviewed by Wang before its publication. After Wang left Chongqing and went abroad, he again attempted to win over a segment of the Central Committee and to instigate certain local military leaders to support his future erratic actions. Fortunately, the nation, from top to bottom, is united in supporting the war effort, and the central authorities have taken appropriate measures. In particular, the military leaders of Sichuan and Yunnan have shown great understanding of righteousness, respecting national interests and loyally supporting the central government's resistance, causing Wang's activities to suffer a major setback. Now, Wang has already left Hong Kong for Shanghai on the 29th of last month. Wang's actions and proposals, whether domestically or internationally, have failed to elicit sympathy or response, and even the Japanese seem to be unable to regard him as a valuable asset. Besides ruining his own future and fully demonstrating the total collapse of certain national scum and corrupt forces, it will not only have no adverse impact on the future of Chinese national liberation, but will instead serve as a sign that the future of the resistance war is secure, which can already be asserted.</p>
<p>However, the conspiratorial activities of Wang and the Japanese traitors have not ceased. It is said that after Wang arrived in Shanghai, he would even convene an illegal Fifth Plenary Session under the protection of the Japanese, in opposition to our Central Fifth Plenary Session, which is one example.</p>
<p>Now that the Central Government has taken strict measures against Wang, Wang can no longer arbitrarily use the name of the Kuomintang to incite chaos, sell out the country, and seek personal gain. The once confused public sentiment will also be stabilized from now on.</p>
<p>In the future, we must further heighten our political vigilance. On the one hand, we hope that military leaders in various regions will take the enlightened authorities of Sichuan and Yunnan as models, wholeheartedly support the central government in resisting the war to the end, and resolutely oppose any compromise or separatist activities; on the other hand, we hope that people from all walks of life will enhance their national self-esteem, increase their belief in the victory of resisting the war and building the nation, consolidate domestic unity, and strive for international assistance. Whether the 28th year will be a year of victory depends entirely on the extent of our efforts!</p>
<h3>Evaluation of the Anti-Communist Front</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang, originally published in the December issue of "Asia Magazine," author: William Henry Chamberlin</p>
<p>What is the real importance of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan? This question has attracted even more attention since Hitler's victorious entry into the Sudetenland; and the Soviet-Japanese war in Zhanggufeng this summer has also increased the importance of this question. Few people can know for sure how close the conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan was to a decisive battle at that time. The preservation of peace was indeed very critical. At that time, Soviet planes bombed the northern part of Japanese-controlled Korea for several days. The Japanese restraint and tolerance saved the peace. It is because Japanese soldiers have never had the doctrine of "accepting insults with a smile." Anyone can imagine how resentful the Japanese officers in the border war zone were when Soviet planes bombed the Japanese positions and the Japanese were not allowed to retaliate. New border conflicts occurred repeatedly, and they could not be resolved satisfactorily. Under such circumstances, future wars will inevitably be affected by the Anti-Comintern Pact. The obligation to oppose the Comintern and the faithful implementation of this obligation are deeply related to future wars.</p>
<p>The Anti-Comintern Pact was initially established on November 2–25, 1936, when it was signed by Japan and Germany in Berlin, stipulating that the governments of the two countries would notify each other of the activities of the Comintern, discuss necessary defensive measures, and implement close cooperation in these measures: jointly agree to take urgent measures to deal with people who directly and indirectly help the Comintern to carry out activities at home and abroad, and invite other countries to join this agreement. About a year later, Italy also joined this agreement. It is very obvious that the inherent meaning of the Anti-Comintern Pact is more important than what it publishes. As for some people's speculation that this agreement has provisions for fighting against the Soviet Union and dividing the Far East into German and Japanese spheres of influence, I think it is not very accurate. In international relations, the situation and opportunities are more important than intentional plans. Japan and Germany are not yet ready to fight against the Soviet Union within a certain designated period. We can see that the Anti-Comintern Pact has four unwritten important meanings: (1) It is a tacit understanding of "insufficient" countries, (2) It is a certificate of sympathy in terms of certain ideas, (3) It is a reflection of the "people's front" strategy of the Comintern, (4) It is a seed for jointly dealing with the Soviet Union in the future, especially for Japan and Germany, there is such a possibility.</p>
<p>Like Germany and Italy, Japan considers itself a country without an heir. It has been unfairly treated in the distribution of world raw materials and colonial markets. It is exploring its investment outlet in China. This is the same situation as Italy's development of Abyssinia and its actions in Spain, and Germany's efforts to seize political and economic control of the Danube River basin. If we do not talk about Germany's commercial interests in China, then Japan and Germany's interests in the Far East do not have serious conflicts. The movement of European borders and the balance of power among European countries are not of much interest to Japan. It is a purely Asian country. Italy does not have important and huge interests in the East. It adopts the method of recognizing "Manchukuo" and openly supporting Japan's actions in China, thinking that helping Japan is in line with Mussolini's policy towards Britain, and Mussolini believes that Japan can win in this war, so he wants to show goodwill to the victor's side, which can protect Italy's interests in the Far East. This seems to be the background of the Italy-Japan-“Manchukuo” trade agreement, hoping that this agreement can increase and balance the trade between Italy and Japan-“Manchukuo.” The total annual trade volume calculated under this agreement is very small, only 54 million Japanese yen, so the importance of this trade agreement belongs to the political aspect, increasing the friendship between the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>Germany's inclination towards the problem of Japan or China is more complicated and requires a longer period of consideration to seek a solution. After Germany's defeat in the European War, it lost many colonies, overseas investments, and extraterritorial rights. It showed great efforts and patience, and established German trade with China on the basis of manufacturing goods not only shipped to China, but also made German manufacturers actively contribute to China, reaching a certain degree of industrial self-sufficiency. German metal and chemical products sold well in the Chinese market. German technical experts helped China establish new factories. In 1935, Germany had seized Britain's position and ranked third in foreign trade with China, closely following the United States, which ranked first, and Japan, which ranked second. A large number of Chinese military supplies were transported from Germany, and there was also a German military advisory group (led by General Falkenhausen) to help train Chinese cadre military talents and provide valuable knowledge close to modern tactics. Because of this situation, we can see that Germany's Far East policy in the first year of the Sino-Japanese War was two-sided. On the one hand, it was the Anti-Comintern Pact and Germany's additional and favorable trade with Japan. On the other hand, it was the huge benefits of Germany's trade with China and the desire to maintain future Sino-German friendship, and General Falkenhausen and his colleagues resigned without prior agreement, believing that serving in China was an honor, especially when China was at war, and the service contract was not yet fulfilled. These two forces were almost completely equal for a period of time, but the continued service of German officers in China created a most inappropriate situation, because Japan and Germany were allies of the Anti-Comintern Pact and had very close relations. Japan never condemned Germany, and its attacks on countries that aided China were extremely fierce, but in fact, German military experts were the most beneficial foreign aid to China, and a large amount of "German-made" ammunition was also transported to China, entering the hands of the Chinese army via Hong Kong. The Japanese who knew this situation all showed great resentment, and the Japanese diplomatic personnel sent to Germany also expressed strong dissatisfaction. In the spring and early summer of this year, Germany showed a gradual inclination towards Japan, and sent former Japanese military attache Ott to replace Dirksen as the German ambassador to Japan. Ott was the one who worked hard to establish the Anti-Comintern Pact. The German ambassador to China, Trautmann, who sympathized with China, was also recalled to his country. More importantly, General Falkenhausen and most of his colleagues were also recalled to Berlin, and the German government also guaranteed to reduce the shipment of ammunition to China, if not completely stop it. Germany's change of Far East policy is justified. The most important reason is that Hitler wants to use Japan as Germany's ally to jointly deal with the Soviet Union, and after Japan occupied important coastal trading ports in China, Germany's trade with China was greatly affected. Germany wants to adopt a pro-Japanese policy to obtain certain benefits in "Manchukuo" and the Japanese-occupied areas, although some knowledgeable Germans do not have extravagant hopes for these.</p>
<p>The world often predicts the Soviet-Japanese war, but the war is always delayed and has not yet occurred. What exactly is the Soviet-Japanese war? Undoubtedly, this war will eventually become a large-scale and fierce conflict. Two countries that suspect and hate each other often have disputes over border issues, and each builds solid defense works on the border. In addition to border issues, the Soviet Union and Japan also have difficulties and grudges in other aspects, such as the dispute over the fishing treaty, the dispute over the Japanese coal mining rights in North Sakhalin, and the various measures taken by the two countries to prevent each other's espionage activities, etc. Looking at the long term, the hope that the Soviet Union and Japan can maintain peace for a long time is not bright, but in the near-sighted observation, the current state of peaceful pretense often has an "incident" that may continue to be maintained for a considerable period of time. It is very obvious that both sides have reasons to restrain the war. Now Japan has a million troops and countless ammunition in various parts of China. At this time, even the most crazy warlord would not welcome fighting against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is also not welcome to fight against Japan at this time, because its internal purge movement continues to be carried out, losing many capable senior officers of the Red Army, and the European situation is still unstable. The Soviet Union is also unwilling to take action lightly. Under such circumstances, Japan has already received the assistance of the Anti-Comintern Pact, because Germany in Europe has made the Soviet Union station a large number of troops in Europe. If Japan and Germany did not have the relationship of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Soviet Union could mobilize its troops in Europe to the Far East.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union or Japan believes that its own strength is sufficient to deal with the other party, then an attack will occur on the border where the incident occurred. The danger of this second Russo-Japanese War is extremely great. It is a great game for the two countries to compete for hegemony in East Asia. If Japan wins this long-term war, then its power on the Asian continent will of course be more solid and stable. After it reaches the position of the leader of the Allies, it can challenge Britain's sea power. Of course, if the Soviet Union fails, it can also weaken the country's will to resist the war. If the Soviet Union wins, it will also have very important consequences. Japan will not only lose the places it occupies in China, but also lose Manchuria and Korea, and even trigger a domestic revolution. Similarly, if the Soviet Union fails, Stalin's dictatorship will inevitably be overthrown, although the entire Soviet administrative rule may still continue to exist. Undoubtedly, both countries are very cautious in considering the possibility of war.</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union and Japan go to war, which country can win? The great writer Tolstoy once said that in war, opportunity and chance are often more important than the most thorough plan. This sentence is even more suitable for modern warfare after scientific development. Predicting the winner of the Soviet-Japanese war is difficult due to the complexity and uncertainty of the international situation. Is Germany going to strike the Soviet Union in Europe now? Will France help the Soviet Union deal with Germany? What is the attitude of the United States? These are all very complicated questions. All we can say is to point out the advantages or strengths that the Soviet Union and Japan can gain in wartime. Which aspect of the strengths is more favorable and can win can only wait for the answer from future history. The Soviet Union's strengths in wartime are: (1) Its aircraft, tanks, and all mechanized weapons are better than Japan's. (2) Its industrial centers and densely populated areas are less vulnerable to air strikes than Japan's industrial centers and densely populated areas. (3) It is rich in resources, and its annual production of coal, steel, and iron is three times that of Japan, and it can be expanded. The Soviet Union also has more than twice as much manpower as Japan. (4) The Soviet Union, unlike Japan, still has to find ways to control "Manchukuo" and many completely peaceful places in North China. Japan's strengths in wartime are: (1) Japan is closer to the war zone, and the railway transportation in "Manchukuo" and Korea is faster and more advantageous than the transportation on the single-track Siberian Railway. (2) According to the opinions of foreign engineers who have worked in the Soviet Union and Japan, Japan's industrial efficiency is higher than that of the Soviet Union. (3) Japan's unity and combat spirit are very good, because Japan is a homogeneous nation, with very little foreign blood and no minority issues.</p>
<p>The future importance of the Anti-Comintern Pact depends on the development of the overall situation in Europe and Asia. Will Europe and Asia gradually be pacified and reach peace? Or will the area of the current struggle be expanded? If the wars in Spain and China gradually cease and a certain new balance is established in Europe and the Far East, then the Anti-Comintern Pact is just a platonic event, with each other issuing statements and information, expressing friendship. This agreement also has no economic value, and Italy's ability to help Japan develop its occupied areas is also extremely limited. However, if there is a tendency towards a major war in Europe and Asia now, and the wars currently taking place in China and Spain are just the prelude to a new world war, then the Anti-Comintern Pact may become a historically noteworthy agreement.

<h3>Wang Zhaoming's Treasonous Collusion with Japan - The Central Government Imposes Severe Punishment, Permanently Expelling Him from the Party and Removing Him from All Positions - The Highest Authorities Will Make a Solemn Statement</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 1st) The Central Standing Committee held a temporary meeting on New Year's Day afternoon. All Central Committee members in Chongqing attended. When discussing Wang's matter, veteran comrades such as Wu Jingheng and Zhang Ji spoke the most, unanimously criticizing Wang. It was decided to expel Wang from the party. It is heard that the position of Deputy General will not be filled temporarily. Wang's telegram was sent separately to the Military Affairs Commission, the National Government, and the Central Party Headquarters, and has now arrived in Chongqing. Our highest authorities have decided to make a solemn statement. All parties do not approve of Wang's actions and unanimously criticize him.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee convened a temporary meeting at 3:30 this afternoon. The standing committee members present were Feng Tianqun, Li Wenfan, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Zou Lu, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Dai Chuanxian. Attending as observers were the executive members Jiao Yitang, Chen Shuren, Jiang Bocheng, Hong Lanyou, Hong Ludong, Ku Nai-kuang, Xiao Tongzi, Wang Luyi, Qian Dajun, Wu Zhongxin, He Jian, Fang Juehui, He Chengjun, Lin Yizhong, Xia Douyin, Su Jisheng, Xu Kan, Liang Hancao, Zhang Bingchang, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Jiwen, Chen Cheng, Mei Gongren, Zhang Daofan, Wang Faqin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Zhou Qigang, Dai Kuaisheng.

Supervisory committee members Jiang Zuobin, Lin Sen, Yu Zhen, Ren Zizhuang, He Yaoshan, Yang, Wu Jingheng, Lin Yun, Zhang Ji, Yao Renhai, Shao Lizi, Wang Zhimai. It is heard that also attending as observers were the alternate supervisory committee members Wen Yiduo, Di Chao, Liu Wendao, Wang Shijie, and Li Ciwen. The chairman presided over the meeting and discussed the case of Wang Zhaoming violating discipline and endangering the party and the nation. It was resolved that Wang Zhaoming be permanently expelled from the party and removed from all positions. At the same time, the Central Supervisory Committee also convened a temporary standing meeting and passed the above resolution. The full text is as follows: Resolution of the Chinese Kuomintang on Expelling Wang Zhaoming from the Party. Wang Zhaoming bore the heavy responsibility entrusted by this party. At a time of emergency in the war of resistance, he abandoned his duties, hid in a foreign land, and spread claims that contravene national policy. In a telegram sent on the 29th, he even based his claims on the Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's arrogant declaration of fundamentally destroying our country, and sought peace and reconciliation. At the same time, he secretly coordinated with enemy newspapers to widely disseminate his claims in the name of advising the central government, showing off his skills to shake public sentiment. The content of his telegrams was especially designed to fulfill the enemy's demands, distorting the truth and sparing no effort to defend the enemy, further intensifying his acts and helping the enemy deceive. In terms of his actions, he is in fact colluding with the enemy to seek surrender, and the impact is directly aimed at shaking the foundations of the nation. Our country initiated the war of resistance in order to save itself and survive. The injuries and deaths of over one million soldiers and the sacrifices of millions of compatriots, with deep and painful feelings, are all intended to fundamentally eliminate the Japanese invaders' conspiracy and to forever preserve the generations of life of our country and nation. For more than a year, the people have been united in spirit, and the soldiers have been bravely carrying out orders. With the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, all are of one mind, persevering and unyielding, with the belief that victory will be achieved. Now, the Japanese ambition to plot against our country is becoming more evident, and their tactics are becoming more malicious. The enemy's hatred throughout our country is becoming more intense, and our determination is becoming more resolute. Wang's words are not only abhorred by the central government, but also not tolerated by the people of the country. It has been determined that no citizen may violate the decisions of wartime national policy during the war, and act on his own. This party's discipline absolutely does not allow exceeding the party's formal resolutions, violating the party's rules, and expressing personal opinions. Wang Zhaoming's actions clearly violate discipline and endanger the party and the nation. In the interest of justice, there is no room for leniency. He should be permanently expelled from the party and removed from all positions in order to rectify party discipline and correct public opinion. Our people must know that the most important key to victory in the war of resistance lies in the unity of will and singleness of spirit. In the past, our nation suffered foreign invasions repeatedly, such as the demise of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, which were only the collapse of one surname and one family's dynasty, not the demise of our nation. However, the reason for their defeat was that the courts at that time were subdued by a small number of treacherous spirits, and their consciences were exhausted, leading to their destruction. It was by no means that the people's spirit and national strength could not resist the Japanese. Therefore, in today's war of resistance, it is not enough to rectify the legal system to invigorate the spirit, and it is not enough to eliminate discord to defeat the strong Japanese. Looking at the recent sinister plans of the Japanese, they are in fact trying to threaten our spirit and lead us to separation and destruction. This party deeply knows that the national consciousness of our compatriots throughout the country is widespread, that the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn period is promoted, and that it is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We must be firm and unyielding, adhere strictly to national policy, and unify our will. Final victory will certainly be achieved. From now on, the national policy of resistance will be based solely on the speech delivered by the party's Commander-in-Chief at the Central Commemoration Week on the 26th of last month. May all our comrades throughout the country and soldiers and compatriots, based on this will, devote their full efforts. All words and actions that violate this purpose are not tolerated by national interests and laws, and must be jointly rejected by the people of the country in order to maintain the will of wartime and complete our revolutionary mission to save the country with the Three People's Principles.</p>
<h3>Government Strictly Orders Punishment of Traitors: Eradicating the Corrupt to Uphold National Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The National Government issued an order on the 1st, stating: Since the commencement of the full-scale War of Resistance, the military and civilians of the entire nation have united against the enemy, prioritizing the nation and the people, resolutely resisting aggression, and remaining steadfast in their determination. However, there are a few unscrupulous individuals who willingly allow themselves to be exploited by the Japanese invaders, shamelessly serving the enemy and aiding their tyranny, which is truly abhorrent. The government has previously issued clear orders to the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and apprehend those who participate in the puppet organizations in various regions, and to punish them according to the law. Regulations for the punishment of traitors have already been promulgated, clearly defining criminal provisions for various treasonous acts, and strictly ordering their implementation to eliminate treacherous individuals. Now, as the situation in the War of Resistance turns favorable, the Japanese aggressors are employing endless schemes. Unless the corrupt elements are eradicated and the masses are encouraged, a special reiteration of laws and decrees is made to inform the public: All those who have participated in illegal organizations in various provinces, except those who were truly coerced and are willing to repent and reform, shall be granted an opportunity to start anew and be exempted from prosecution. However, should there be any national traitors who remain unrepentant, or who serve in puppet regimes, or secretly act as Japanese collaborators, daring to defy the condemnation of the world and willing to be abandoned by the people, their crimes are unforgivable. The Military Affairs Commission shall be responsible for conducting thorough investigations, strictly apprehending and punishing them according to the regulations for the punishment of traitors, to uphold national law and satisfy the people's desires. This order.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Goes to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] According to reliable sources, Wang Jingwei left Hong Kong on the morning of December 29th aboard the Italian mail steamer Conte Rosso for activities in Shanghai. It is said that Wang had intended to convene an illegal Fifth Plenary Session in Guangzhou, but it was thwarted by various obstacles. He also attempted to meet with a representative of General Zhang Fakui, Deputy Commander of the Fourth War Zone, but was sternly refused. Knowing that he could not operate in Hong Kong, Wang reluctantly went to Shanghai, and may proceed to Nanjing to convene an illegal Fifth Plenary Session. The head of the Japanese special service in South China, He Zhi, has also left Hong Kong for Shanghai to make arrangements. As for the activities of the Doihara principle, that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan for Our Newspaper, 2nd] It is heard here that before leaving Chongqing, Wang Jingwei had planned to influence military leaders in Sichuan and Yunnan to form a pro-Japanese puppet government with himself as its head. However, the military leaders of Sichuan and Yunnan, being fully aware of the greater good, firmly refused to be deceived. Wang's conspiracy was also discovered by the central government, so he ultimately had no choice but to flee far away. However, his ambition has not died, and he is still trying to make trouble. It was rumored earlier that Wang intended to first contact the Japanese, to have the Japanese troops in Guangzhou withdraw to the suburbs and important strongholds in the Pearl River Estuary, in order to deceive the public. At the same time, he would organize a new puppet government in Guangzhou to rally support. But judging from the current situation, this idea seems to have become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Hong Kong] According to reliable sources, Wang himself issued the so-called peace proposal last month on the 30th, and then secretly fled to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he will be under the protection of the Japanese, which is safer than anywhere else. The reliable source also said that the two organizations in Beiping and Nanjing have not been able to unite. This time, Wang Jingwei has arrived in Shanghai and will lead the reorganization of a puppet government to rule Beiping, Nanjing, and other occupied areas, with Wang serving as the so-called president of the puppet organization.</p>
<p>The Overall Situation is Increasingly Optimistic</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 1st] Official sources here state that during the Lugouqiao Incident, before the fall of Nanjing, and after the loss of Hankou, Wang Jingwei repeatedly advocated peace. However, he always claimed to support Chairman Chiang and other leaders in their determination to continue the War of Resistance. Chinese sources here feel that China's position today is very strong. In fact, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has never been as strong as it is today. There are four main reasons for this: (1) The Chinese army has been thoroughly reorganized and redeployed, making it suitable for a long-term war of resistance. (2) As a result of loans from Britain and the United States to China, China's financial position has been greatly stabilized. (3) "The Japanese assurance of protecting the rights and interests of third countries in China has been doubted by Britain and the United States." Therefore, China's international position is also stronger than before. (4) The provinces of the Northwest and Southwest resolutely support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and resistance to the Japanese army has become more profound. The conditions for this resistance are also quite favorable. After the fall of Hankou, China's prospects for the War of Resistance seemed quite bleak, and Wang's proposal for peace was somewhat understandable. But today's situation is improving, and it is almost unbelievable that Wang is talking about peace. Therefore, Wang's actions are not only not endorsed by the government, but also abhorred by the people.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai's Remarks: Not Surprised by Wang's Rebellion; Says it Has No Impact on the Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Zhou Enlai, a prominent leader of the Chinese Communist Party, stated to Reuters today, "I am not surprised by Wang's peace movement, as I have known Wang for twenty years and have long known him to be a cowardly and timid person. Throughout his political career, he has often changed his views and positions. In 1927, he cooperated with the Communists in Hankou and participated in the Yan-Feng War and the Hu Hanmin Incident in Guangzhou. Whenever difficulties arose, he would betray his colleagues. He is an opportunist who follows the path of least resistance. Wang initially promoted peace negotiations with the Japanese after the fall of Guangzhou and before the loss of Hankou. At that time, he gave a statement to Reuters, stating that China was prepared to negotiate peace. This statement was strongly refuted by the military commanders who participated in the military conference held in Hunan last November, including General Zhang Fakui, who had been a close confidant of Wang for many years. During the National Congress held in Chongqing last November, a close confidant of Wang Jingwei said that China could not rely on the assistance of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, but had to seek the assistance of Germany and Italy to negotiate peace with the Japanese. Wang may have submitted peace proposals to the Japanese through his representative in Hong Kong, and that representative has visited Tokyo at least once. Wang's actions have no impact on China's internal unity or the strength of its resistance. Currently, Wang has no supporters in the Kuomintang, the National Government, or the army, except for a handful of cronies such as Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi. It is not yet certain whether Gu Mengyu and Chen Gongbo intend to participate in Wang's actions. The rumor that Wang went to Hong Kong with the understanding of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is purely a rumor. I firmly believe that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek would never have approved of Wang's actions."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Newspapers Denounce Wang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Shanghai newspapers have all published the full text of Wang's telegram advocating peace. The headlines and editorials of the newspapers unanimously denounce him, saying that he is destroying his own history and alienating himself from the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Regarding Wang Jingwei's telegram to the central government, the Shen Bao said that Wang Jingwei was completely mad. The Xinwen Bao said that Wang Jingwei actually advocated accepting Japanese peace terms. The Yi Bao said, "Is Wang Jingwei really so muddleheaded? I originally hoped it was a rumor, because since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, we have only seen traitors like Wang Kemin advising the National Government to accept peace proposals. How could Mr. Wang not understand the stakes involved?" The China Morning Post criticized him as being unscrupulous, succumbing to Japan to beg for peace, willingly acting as a traitor, and betraying the party and the country. The Wenhui Bao commented that, "If Wang Jingwei commits seppuku, what will history write about him? It is simply unimaginable. Qin Hui, Wu Sangui, and even Wang Kemin and Qi Xieyuan cannot compare to him." The Dao Bao said, "Is Wang Jingwei really cutting himself off from China?" The Zhongmei Ribao pointed out that Wang Jingwei was completely fooled by Konoe's declaration and was isolating himself from the people. The Damei Wukan said that Wang Jingwei's bizarre peace telegram isolated himself from the nation, and that Wang, having betrayed the country, could not represent the central government and had no great influence on the future of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Great Victory on the Nanxun Front: Our Three-Pronged Attack Yields Significant Gains; A New Gift from the Soldiers of Northern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhanggongdu, 1st] On the Nanxun front, apart from minor skirmishes between our guerrillas and the Japanese on the north bank of the Xiu River in the past month, there has been no fierce fighting on the main front. Since the morning of the 28th, when the Japanese launched an attack on the north bank of Zhanggongdu and suffered losses, the situation has again become quiet. Our side has long intended to break this stagnant situation and launch a fierce attack on the Japanese. On the eve of New Year's Day, taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness, we launched a sudden and fierce three-pronged attack on Yongtiao, De'an, and various key points where the Japanese were stationed. One route first launched a strong assault on the Japanese positions at Huangjinshan and Hejiashan, north of Yongxiu. After fierce fighting lasting about two hours, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray. Our army occupied the area before noon and continued to recover Songzhuang, Hushan, and other places. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, with over a thousand rifles and many other military supplies and documents captured. Another route also launched an attack simultaneously, recapturing Qingshan, Liuzhuang, Gulaoling, and other places, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing over ten rifles and three pistols. Yet another route also made rapid progress, capturing Outangshi and Shaxiawang before noon, and continuing to launch a flank attack on the Japanese at Jinzhi. Caught unprepared, the Japanese were thrown into chaos by our strong assault and fled in disarray. Our army pressed forward and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese. Currently, fighting is still taking place in Shatabei and other areas. The long-quiet Nanxun front suddenly reported good news on the auspicious occasion of New Year's Day, the first of the 28th year of the Republic. This is truly the ultimate gift presented by the soldiers on the Nanxun front to the leaders and the people of the country. It can also be seen as a sign that the War of Resistance is entering a new phase.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China, Hata Shunroku, Wounded: Shot by Our Air Force in a Vital Spot; Yamada to Succeed Him</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in Central China, was shot by our air force with machine guns in the vicinity of Yueyang last week. His left ribs were seriously injured. At the time, Hata was traveling by car from Hankou to Guangdong, intending to direct military affairs. When he reached the outskirts of Yueyang, he was shot and wounded by our air force. Hata was subsequently sent to Nanjing for treatment. Doihara visited him.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] According to official sources, General Hata Shunroku, who succeeded Matsui as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Central China, has also been removed from his post. His position will be taken over by Major General Yamada, commander of the 12th Division of the Army. Yamada's rank is not only two grades below Hata's, but also below Admiral Shikawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China. Yamada's current whereabouts are unknown. One rumor says he has returned to Japan, while another says Hata is seriously ill and is being treated at a hospital in Nanjing. Wu Tiecheng has gone to Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Xikang Provincial Government on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kangding, 1st] On the grand morning of the first day of the 28th year of the Republic, Xikang, the newest province in the westernmost part of China, was finally born amidst the severe winter and biting north wind. Special representatives from Tibet participated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kangding, 2nd] Kang Province has decided to establish five administrative inspectorates, with the selection of candidates still underway.

<h3>New Year's Eve Amidst the Flames of War: Chairman Chiang Remains Diligent All Night; Madam Chiang Launches Fundraising Campaign to Aid Families of Sichuan Soldiers Fighting the Japanese</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Last New Year's Eve, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was still busy reviewing important official documents, while Madam Chiang attended a banquet of the New Life Movement Promotion Association. A total of 400 guests were invited to the banquet, and 16,000 yuan was raised on the spot to aid the families of Sichuan soldiers fighting on the front lines. Madam Chiang then auctioned off a silver cup, which was obtained by Lu Zuofu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Last New Year's Eve, hundreds of female students, nurses, and Boy Scouts paraded through the main streets with silk banners, which were then presented to Madam Chiang. The banners were inscribed with the words "Leader of Women" and "Savior of Children." London Press Observation.</p>
<h3>Konoe's Statement: Not Worth a Penny; London Press Observation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Daily Telegraph, published here, states that while Prime Minister Konoe has suggested withdrawing troops from China, the true rulers of Japan are the senior generals of the army and navy. It questions what ability Konoe or other politicians have to make the troops in China withdraw, or whether it is a preliminary condition for negotiations with China. Even if that were the case, what hope is there that the terms of peace will be more lenient?</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] Reuters has learned that the Chinese in London express resentment towards Wang Jingwei's actions, fearing that this will give the impression of internal disunity. They repeatedly emphasize that all sections of Chinese society support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and that Chairman Chiang's resolute rejection of Japanese peace terms is also supported by the whole country. They believe that there is no possibility of compromise between China and Japan, and the proposal for China to join the "Japan-Manchukuo" economic bloc has been resolutely rejected, as this would simply place China completely under Japanese control. Commentators deeply doubt Wang Jingwei's ability to rally support, but consider the rumors that Wang will participate in the puppet organizations in Nanjing and Beiping to be ridiculous. Some believe that Wang's actions, if they fail, will be to seek better peace terms from Japan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang on the International Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui published a special commentary, reviewing the development of the international situation last year. Wang specifically pointed out that in November of last year, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States jointly made representations to Japan regarding the opening of navigation on the Yangtze River, and that in November, the United Kingdom and the United States provided loans to China. The tough stance of the Soviet Union in the Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations shows that although the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are going their separate ways, they are still proceeding towards the same goal.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Bombs Nanjing: Several Japanese Garrison Units Hit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Our air force again flew to Nanjing on the 30th to bomb the former arsenal, which has now been converted into a Japanese military police garrison. Four bombs were dropped, all of which exploded immediately. The Japanese suffered many casualties.</p>
<h3>Wreckage of Missing Aircraft Found on Yunnan-Chongqing Route: Many Remains Found in the Plane</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Word was received here today that the Boeing aircraft that went missing on the Chongqing-Kunming route has been found 240 kilometers southeast of Kunming. The fuselage was destroyed, and the remains of the pilot, the Russian co-pilot, the Chinese radio operator, and the mechanic were found inside. The plane was burned, making identification extremely difficult. Fortunately, a map with the character "Pan" engraved on it was found, making identification possible. The cause of the crash is still unknown. It is believed that it may have been shot down by a Japanese plane, which is quite possible in that area. The pilot, Jenson, and his new wife are now in Kunming.</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi on the War Situation in the Southwest</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd) Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Military Headquarters recently returned here from inspecting the defense lines. In order to understand the latest developments in the Southwest war situation, the reporter paid a special visit this morning to inquire about the situation. Bai said that although the Japanese army in central Guangdong has been slightly active recently, except for the increase of troops to one division in Sanshui, the other areas are still lying in wait and stubbornly defending. The Japanese in Guangzhou are making every effort to consolidate their position, and heavy troops are stationed in Shunde, Huangpu, Zengcheng, Foshan, Sanshui, and Jiujiang, actively building fortifications to protect Guangzhou City and prevent our advance. The strength of the Japanese army in the West River and Beihai has not increased, and they are still entrenched and waiting for reinforcements. Looking at the war on all fronts, it seems to have become quiet on the surface. However, this silence is by no means a standstill. The Japanese strength has been broken, and they are exhausted and unable to launch an attack. It seems that they are trying their best to replenish their strength, so no major battles are likely to occur. However, the Japanese are still actively plotting to invade the West River and Beihai. We have already seen through the Japanese army's various conspiracies, and all routes have been prepared and are waiting in strict formation. The Japanese plan to enter Nanning from Beihai to cut off our important transportation routes, but that transportation route has been completely cut off by us. The grain has been moved, and the guerrillas are swarming. At the same time, the mountains are steep, and the terrain is favorable to us. If the Japanese come to attack, they will be annihilated. Although the Japanese attempt to attack Wuzhou from the West River has been thwarted, they have not given up the idea of invading. If the Japanese come again, the difficulties they will encounter will be ten times greater than before. The second phase of the full-scale War of Resistance has begun, and we are determined to advance by implementing a comprehensive strategy of striking the Japanese. Therefore, I have been actively promoting methods of emphasizing politics over military affairs and the masses over soldiers. In particular, after this trip to the front, I deeply feel the importance of political power. In Guangxi, we plan to formulate a national public agreement and regulations. Once approved, we will order all the people of the province to swear to abide by them. The content is roughly as follows: In terms of combat, agree not to be traitors, not to be submissive people, not to be Japanese spies, not to participate in puppet organizations, not to build roads for the Japanese, and not to serve the Japanese. In terms of economics, agree not to buy Japanese goods, not to use Japanese materials, not to use Japanese currency, and not to cooperate with the Japanese economically. If this plan is implemented in Guangxi, I will propose to the central government that it be adopted. I believe that this will have great power in the overall strategy of the War of Resistance.</p>
