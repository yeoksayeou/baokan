<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本反英與英國的強靭性</h3>
<p>據北平外訊，「華化各地的反英運動日漸激烈」，又據日方消息，「蒙古也發生反英運動，並舉行反英大會」。開封方面也於本月廿四日舉行反英反法反蘇大會。日本嗾使傀儡進行排外特別是排英，已到如火如荼的局勢。</p>
<p>日本之排外反英運動，不自今日始，早在法西斯右派領袖末次大將任職內相的當時，日本的排吳運動卽已烙印日本政府的商標，日本東方會總裁，中野正剛也早在去年屢次著論對英蘇美法大肆攻擊。但是這次日本的排外運動却帶上了兩種特質：（一）放鬆美蘇法而集中衆矢於英國一，國身上；（二）不由日本本國出頭，而間接嗾使傀儡出來執行。這裏是有極濃厚的新階段的意義。</p>
<p>日本報紙對於英國最近的積極援華認爲非友誼的措置，大阪每日新聞的特號標題，各報一齊主張：英國若始終固執於其傳統的遠東政策，則今後日本在推進對英政策上，必須一擲從來的協力態度，加强採取新方策對付的决意。這是一種有力量的信號，不久的過去，中野正剛甚且把他的嗽叭筒帶到上海來狂吹，他說英日兩國在華勢力尖鋒相對，如果日本一退縮，英國卽將擴張。因此，他主張，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，甚至說盎格魯撒克遜，兩大國家，是日本的眞正敵人。中野正剛的這種主張，雖然不能完全代表日本政府的政策，但却充分反映着日本侵略者目前意識的動向。</p>
<p>在日本這種信號指揮之下，中國淪陷區的偽組織相繼發起什麼排英會，什麼反英會，發表什麼反英宣言，散發什麼反英傳單，並舉行反英游行，灌注反英思想，等等狂妄舉動，光怪陸離，無奇不有，深究日本積極排英的動機不外乎（一）報復英國之積極援華；（二）對英加以威脅與恫嚇；（三）脅逼英國一方面對它讓步，一方面出頭調停中日戰爭。但是第三次的企圖已經完全失敗了；日本此後對英的政策，或竟因惱羞成怒，更加加劇排英的運動，但是我們還須認陷於苦惱中的侵畧者的恐嚇手勢，是沒有底氣的，如果英國更進一步　　　　　　　　　　，那末，軟化屈膝的當不是英國，　　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>今日，英日的利害固已水火不能相容，但是雙方形勢的優劣却甚懸殊。在國際上，日本欲與民主國家和平妥協而不可得，欲與德意極權國家索性結車事同盟又有所不敢，英國則只要拿出勇氣直向反侵畧陣線的締造上邁進，世界大多數國家都可以形隨而影從。在國內問題上，日本還有許多有力的阻碍，不許它澈底與德意爲友而與英美法蘇爲仇：英國呢，只要現政府勇敢走向制裁世界侵略者的大道，則不但內政風波不興，現政府的地位並且能夠益加鞏固。近日來，日本平沼首相與板垣陸相等的頻繁集議，完全爲了考慮當前日益惡劣的環境；英國則握着擴大日本惡劣環境的權柄。英國絲毫沒有恐懼日本排英的道理。</p>
<h3>（下）　〔五四〕，中國近代史上的光輝的一頁</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>『五四』，是中國近代史上最光輝的一頁。五四運動，鞏固了中山先生領導的政治運動的基礎，五四運動，還開　了中華民族文化革命社會革命以至於民族革命的大路。</p>
<p>五四運動的事實是這樣的，當默洲大戰之際，日本帝國主義乘　强佔了德國在華的殖民地，脅逼袁世凱簽訂傷亡中國的廿一條。造成了『五七』『五九』的國恥紀念，袁世凱死後，段祺瑞領導的安福系又同日×勾結，進行五萬萬的大借欵，簽訂了所謂共同防敵的軍事協定，允許日×　有戰時在華的一切權利，如代管膠濟鐵路，廣聘日籍顧問。同時段祺瑞又籍口參戰，由日×供給一萬萬四千萬日金的所謂「西原借欵」那時還允許日軍淮駐吉林，黑龍江和外蒙。一九一八年底，歐洲大戰結東。一九一九年一月，在巴黎召開和平會議，中國不僅沒有因爲參戰卽得到報酬，反而損失極大權利，和會决定將德國在山東的一切權利全部由日本權承，日×保持在華的特殊利益與特殊地位。</p>
<p>在安福系的政權之下，是不斷的襄權辱國！是不斷的禍國殃民！</p>
<p>五四運動便在這內外交迫的勢形之下激發起來。北京的生首先團結起來了！一九一九年（民國八年）五月四日，化京學生集合三千多人，舉行中國歷史上空前的大示威，他們結隊巡行，向總統府請顯，要求徵辦賣國賊曹汝霖，陸宗，章宗祥，不意政府拒不接受反而强解飲巡行的學生隊伍，演出了在　家樓焚曹打章的轟轟烈烈的民族革命的悲壯劇，北京學生還立刻成立學生會，組織演劇團，和檢查日貨隊，各界一致響應，罷課，罷工，罷市，援助北京學省學展開反日和抵制日貨的運動。接着全國學生及工農商生。各省學生，紛紛成立學生會，瑞大反日運動。各地學生還推舉代表到上海，成立全國性的學生組織，領導全國抗日運動。同時全國各界則紛紛組織請顧團，請求政府拒絕簽字和約，要求取消滅亡中國的二十一條，要求懲辦親日派賣國賊。上海和其他都市的學生和工商各界，還於罷工罷市之外，還要求「外交公開」，要求實現民主政治，要求言論出版，集會結社的自由，於是，五四運動便由北京學生的愛國運動，轟轟烈烈地展開了</p>
<p>第一</p>
<p>第二，我們要認消，五四運動是在中國革命史上，第一次明確地執行統一戰綫戰鬥綱領的運動，它開始由學生發動，接着全國各地學生，文化人，工人，商人，都羣起響應，共同行動，而革命的黨派，亦都以最大力量支持這一還動，然後才能獲得其應有的成功，達到親日派曹陸章三人撤職，喪　辱國的廿一條件宣告無效，我國出席巴黎和平代表的拒絕簽字，和以後華盛頓會議中獲得山東問題的勝利解决。現在我們的國際環境更轉有利，×人的實力則呈良退，我國政府民衆聯系又轉爲親密，自更易於達到我們的要求，我們今日必須接受五四運動這種寶貴的教訓，加緊內部的團結，鞏固與擴展與民族各黨派各團體各界民衆的抗日一戰綫，援助前綫及×後英勇抗日的將士與民衆，特別要加緊反對漢好賣國賊的『反共和平』運動，爭取最俊的勝利。</p>
<p>第三，我們要認淸五四運動在本質上是一種民主運動，而我們今日的抗戰建國，誠如取高領袖最近在國民參致會三次大會上，也是一種要求澈底實現眞正民主的運動。我們今日這個民主運動，對外要求獨立與平等，對內要求民主與統一，而在全世界，則又成爲反對法西斯侵略，保衛民主與和平的主要力量。因此我們今日必須發揚光大五四運動爭取民主的精神，我們要擴大全國人民對於民主政治及抗戰時期實施民主的重大意義。我們要知道現在政府與民衆已經站在一條戰綫上努力奮鬥，如果我　的政治越加充滿民主精神，則民衆越加愛護政府，政府力量越加偉大，政府與民衆肃淸賣國好調和一致對外的力量亦越加强固。國際　情援玏亦必越加增多與擴大，祇有實行民主盡量發揮人民力量，才能保證抗戰必勝建國必成。</p>
<p>第四，我們要認淸五四運動是中國新文化的啓蒙運動，是中華民族革命的前衛戰鬥，它不僅是一九二五——二七年的大革命的序幕，也可這是目前中國抗，建國運動的先導。我們要求抗戰建國的最後成功，必須在今日繼承五四新文化動運動的光榮傳統，展開文化運動動，我們要建立文化工作的統一而廣泛的組織。</p>
<p>就民族革命的實踐，抗戰中的一切經驗和教訓，和理論配合起來，對於國際問題，政治間題，軍事問題。社會問題，經濟問題以至思想問題，進行專門的研究。同時關於推除各地教育，推廣大衆文化，供應前綫文化食糧。建立文化堡壘，淸文化漢奸封建殘餘，和法西斯文化進攻等工作，亦應積極推進。</p>
<p>第五，我們更須認淸五四運動是中國學生靑年運的光榮的起點。自五四運動以後，中國學生運動靑年運動，不僅在每個中華民族革命運動中建有許多光榮的血蹪，並且在全世界靑年學生運動中取得光榮重要的地位和發生模範的　領導的作用。我們今日更須使其發掦光大，加緊擴展靑年學生運動，在我們靑年學生本身，今後應努力於：（一）貢獻我們所有的力量，擁護中央，團結抗戰。反對漢奸賣國賊的「反共和平」運動；（三）在政府領導下，加緊軍事政治的訓練，帮助政府兵役運動，動員廣大靑年到軍隊中去，動員廣大靑年參加戰時服務。（三）爲要實現上述任務，必須盡力鞏固與擴大政府領導下的學生青年救國團體，（四）密切和民主各國及全世界規模的靑年學生團體的合作，擴大全世界反法西斯及侵略和援華制日運動。同時我們希望政府及社會領袖：（一）明文保障青年學生抗日救國運動的自由，（二）充實及擴大三民主義靑年團，不分黨　民族階級，吸收廣大願為民族解放及貫徹三民主義而奮鬥的青年。（三）切實按照抗戰建國綱領及最近弟三次全國教育會議，實施抗戰教育。（四）救濟失學兒童與靑年，救濟失業及流亡靑年，獎勵僑胞及友邦熱心人士爲發展文化教育事業而指輸。（五）有計劃地培植大批青年幹部，切實提拔大批靑年參加政治，參加抗戰建國事業。</p>
<p>悲壯的戰鬥的革命的五月，所有歷史的意義，戰鬥的經驗和教訓，革命的理論，孫中山先生的三民主義和三大政業，馬克思的科學的社會主義和其他偉大的豐富的著作，所有這一切，都是我們今日推行抗戰建國和發展全世界的反法西斯反侵略戰鬥之必需，我們要誠意地接受，深刻的研究，配合着實際戰鬥，爭取　廣大更光榮的勝利。</p>
<h3>粵北前綫的余漢謀將軍</h3>
<p>— （本報特稿）中國之友在中國（十）　葉厥孫</p>
<p>越過了羅浮山脹上的不少山頭，汽車的病後身軀不免有點震顯小穩。我們坐在車上，像流覽銀慕上的畫片似地，注意着沿途各鄉村裏的人民動　！田野裏，山腰中，公路上，處處皆有勞作着的　人，樵夫，和正在修公路的人民，士兵，那種安靜，慰快，勤勞的精神，表揚出他們的深刻，偉大。二十日下午二點鐘左右到逹了余漢　將軍的總部，上次記者曾到過此地一次，舊地重逢，故一切都無什麼困難。在副司令長官部的門口遇到了一位姓朱的先生，他是從英國囘來的留學生，講得一口好英語，由於他的招待，我們入進了客廳，等候看余先生的光臨。景像還是和上次一樣，　旁的牆壁上貼着兩張極精細的廣東軍事地圖，在左旁的牆角上還　一幅關於珠江一帶的水利河流的地圖，非常明白精詳，上面的註解皆爲日文。據王參謀長說：「這是惠州克復的時候，從×人那裏得來的。』過去我們對於所謂『友邦」的過份客氣，釀成了今天「漢奸如毛」以至×人的車事地圖竟會如此細密的結果。過了一會，余副司令長官出來了，高大魁偉的身材，有着一副像有點害羞似的鄉間農民的微笑，一望而知是個忠厚純樸的人物；講話的時候，他首先表示對於李蒙夫婦的同情中國抗戰和不辭辛苦地跑到廣東前綫深致謝意，法國是愛好自由，獨立的國家，而現在中國亦正爲追求自由和獨立而奮鬥，故中法兩國是可以結爲好友的。接着李蒙夫婦當然回敬一道謝和致敬的所謂『禮貌話』。當我們談到廣東軍事狀况的時候，余先生很與奮地手執籐鞭，指點着地闆解說×人進攻廣州時的狀况，以及當時廣東內部軍事力量的薄弱，然後再說明×人在廣東的收獲不過是佔領了廣州近郊的幾個城池，不論在軍事經濟上講，與我們長期抗戰的戰略皆無多大影響。因爲廣州失守，後由於我們放棄了對于被動地作一站的防守，現在已取得了主動的，靈活的攻勢，×人處處受我們的控制。以經濟上講，中國是　農業國，一向皆是鄉村供給都市，繁榮都市的，現任我們放果了都市，一方面因爲減輕了農村的負担　緊榮農村，另方面由於我們不與×人合作而使都市成為死城。……此後的廣東車事發展照我們自己的估計，×人是難得冉　便宜的了，一則是內部車事力量的充實，二則是民衆動員的開展，三則是×人力量的格外分散。</p>
<p>余先生因爲知道我們還未午餐，談話也就暫時簡短地結束了，我們共同坐在剛才的那張桌子上就膳，這是一席相當　樣的西餐，當然比之上海，香港，等都市餐　的東西不免相差尚遠。可是，以前綫的長官司令部講，這不能不說難得的富麗景况了，廣東眞是個富庶的地方，不論那一村那一小鎮儘管是戰時，白米飯，又燒總還是不成問題的。比起貴州，雲南，以及西北各地的許多中鄉村來，眞是天漏之别了。午飯的時候，余漢謀將軍還講了許多對於部隊　政治工作的計劃，他準備此後不獨是連就是排裏面都要有政治指導員。政治工作是維持和培養良好軍紀動力，同時也是加强戰鬥力的要素。對於這一切，李　夫婦表示極大的與奮，他們說：『在巴黎的時候聴說廣東失守，一般人皆以爲整個廣東完結了，因爲，不滿大家說，法國人對於地理的常識是相當的不行的。他們心中所知道的中國，不過是地很大，人很多，而有着上海，天津，北平，廣州……等城市，就是以我自已說吧。直至到了此地之後，才知廣州之與廣東實不過是一個較大的城市而已，佔地理，經濟，文化，……上的地位也並不怎樣了不起，並且，政治，軍事，經濟，文化等還都會因着人的轉移而轉移。所以，我覺得對于日本人在中國祗有點和綫　佔領而中國軍隊依然控制住面的事實，在國際宣傳上是值得特別强調的。邊吃邊談，余司令的興緻亦甚濃　，他說記者前次和陸貽任重高詠諸　的來廣東乃是中國記者自廣州失守之後，最先進入廣束前　，而李蒙夫婦則爲外國記者中的第一人，到了四點鐘的樣子我們才算放下刀叉，盡歡散席。出總部門口，乘車向雕此地十多里的鄉間政治部進發。</p>

<h3>游擊區宣傳綱要（四）　軍委會政治部製發</h3>
<p>第三、抗戰轉入第二期以來、×人優良的武器威力銳减、冒險深入、不能不有所躊躇、因此軍事上不易種得表面上的騰利、向來誇大的欺騙宣傳、頓失效力、故在第二期抗戰中、對外侵略戰事、巳失去其緩和內部仰突的作用、反而成爲促進內部面突的原因、近術內閣的塌台、平沼內閣內部的矛盾、就是明設、這又予我以進行對×宣傳莫大的方便、</p>
<p>（三）我們對×抗戰與×之窮兵讀武不同、我們是爲民族生存、國家獨立而戰、是爲代界和平人　正義而戰、所以在宣傳上也理適　壯、不但對內宣傳無所用其欺騙、卽對×宣傳、也不需要欺騙的手段、只須直陳其理、學證事實、便足粉碎×人的欺驢宣傳、就足以成爲有力的宣傳、而取得×偽官兵的相信、因此、（子）我們要明白告訴×人士兵、日關的侵略戰爭、對于他們和他們國家、給以怎樣巨大的損害、職爭給與他們和他們家屬、只是飢膚和死亡、要告訴他們日本的關際地位、巳日漸衰落、由侵略得到好處的、只是少歡　閥與財關及他們的走狗、要吿訴、們關于×友之分辦、日本士兵的×人不是中國、而是主持侵羣的軍關、中國在同情日本士兵反我的立場上、是他們絕對的友人、同時吿訴他信、此權反戰鬥爭、也有國內外愛好正義的民衆、與願意維持和平的民主國家、尤其中國作他們的後屆、故他們唯一的出路、但是變侵略的對華戰爭、爲民族的打倒國內軍閥的戰爭、（丑）我們要會訴朝鮮台凈出身的士兵、他們爲日本少數軍閥財開來估拼命的結果、只是增加他們自己的痛苦、加重日閥對于他們緊迫和掖取、他們只有償機起來把拿在手裏的武器、掉換頭去、打擊他們的眞正×人——日本的少數軍閱財閥——才能獲得民族與自己的解放和自由、（實）我們要告訴一切偽軍、他們不應該受日×和漢奸的威脅欺歸、來打自己的兄弟、替×人當砲灰、要他們　、妝他們被迫止火　的時候、他們的家屬、正在受×寇的壓這和監視、正在忍觀挨餒、替×人作耕關、要他們掉換槍開、打殺×偽軍、反正過官來、一全　逐×寇、收　央地、（卯）爲了增加我們政治攻勢的力量、增加我們對×宣傳的效果、我們必須偉竺俘虜；最高領袖在抗戰工作應特別注意各點中指示灃『爭先活擒俘瞄與優特俘虜、昆殺俘膚」爲的是優待俘虜、不但是在人道上、國際法上應該優待他們、而且在作戰和政治官傳的便利上、也應該優待他們、爭取他們來帮助我們、續大對×宣傳的效果、瓦解偽軍、動橋×軍、因爲這種處置、足以表示、（一）我仁×暴、在政治方面　擊×人、（二）揭　×所發的中國殺戰俘　的欺　宣偉、消滅×士兵怕懼心理、可以減輕其必死的頑抗、避免我們不必要的犧牲、（辰）我們對待俘　的方法、第一要尊總他們的人格、不要傷嘗他們的感情、把他們當作我們的友人看待、爭取他們轉變成爲打倒日閥的戰友第二要使他們安心、負傷者必須先爲撩治、再行　業間、第三問話時、（一）不可加以威脅、（二）不可加以　笑、（三）要有　心、不要希望立卽得到效果、（四）要爲他們保守秘密、不要讓記者隨便拍照和接談、（五）必須幞可能的迅速送至後方、第四送進收容所後、心須積極加以感　敎育、</p>
<p>官傳人員之紀律與修養</p>
<p>戰地宣傳工作人員、處於更艱苦的環境、曾有更韋大的責任、故更續有刻苦耐勞堅决卓絕的精神、二期抗戰開　以後、最高領袖及部長歷次對於政工人員的訓話、關於政工人員所　守的紀律與應具的精神、有懇切明白的訓示、</p>
<p>（一）關於紀律方面、最高領袖對政工會議訓詞說、一政工人員必須在生活上行動上、表現正確感化官兵、不但使其不疑、而且使之信仰、則一切工作實施、未有辦不到者、」（部長也有具體的指示）政工紀律除原、規定者外、茲訂以下原則、一以民心之向背定部隊之紀律　、一以部隊之紀律、定政工之成織』、戰地宣傳工作人員、必須齡格遵守身體力行、藉以改止人們輕視宣傳工作的觀念、</p>
<p>（二）宣傳工作展進與否、繫於工作人員之、　者是大、故宣傳工作人員、須努力進修、以取得被宣傳奢的信仰、（一）第一必須以身作則、最高領袖所訓示我們　政工人員之態度、行勸必須公正、生活必須節儉、所謂「以言敎」不如『以身敎』、感召之速且大也、部長訓示我們、「各政工人員、幷須作中活之宣傳、以　線生活等於士兵之生活、後方生活等於民衆之生活爲　準、再宣傳應以身體力行爲主、不尙空談、」（二）　二應　通訊兵炊事兵之服務精神、部長訓詞、我們「政工人員、應具通訊兵之精神、早起將陲、這都很要緊的、工作信條能够做到這兩點、才能受人尊敬、　人表率」、在戰地做宣傳工作、尤其是對×宣傳工作、更需要通訊兵之、神、（先部隊而到達後部隊而離開」（三）第三、必須隨時研究隨時學習、隋　反省、因爲我們的抗戰、在中外沒有先列、所以我們必須隨時隨地因人人事、番心研究、細心學習、虛心反省、接受血的寳實經騐、創造出我們新的勝利的工作方式來、</p>

<h3>貼近火綫的臺山</h3>
<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>【民革社台山通訊】越過一般人認爲艱險的水程、于晨光熹微中到達台山、</p>
<p>台由雖巳貼近火綫、但一切仍安靖如常、記者憶及在港時、報紙曾傳台山城被炸得很厲害、抵台山後、始知全屬子虛、</p>
<p>據縣府各長官語記者、冲婁斗山並未炸過、但白沙公益確曾被炸、災情相當慘重、死傷約二三百人、據這裏的某長官說、「廣海有我們鐵的陣壘、×人如來當試、一定要硬個焦　爛額」、據此間接得之確息、　廣海很遠的海面、或有×艦遊弋、但從未敢接近廣海的、</p>
<p>台山各城鎮的情形、也很安靜、商人照常做生意、學校照常上課、墟明趁壚依然種躍、但公益被炸後、情　略感瀟條了、</p>
<p>動員　工作</p>
<p>江會戰事發生後、像是突來一個晴天游壢、台民不免有點慌張、但政府非常　定、像劉戰事應付裕如、目前「抗先隊」聯同「動員委員會」、發動一個「武裝保衛大台山的緊急宣傳週」、動員全縣知識份子、靑年學生、分配深入四鄉宣傳、在安靜而又荒張的鄉村間、注入了許多刺激劑和與奮劑、合民就　　從荒張到與奮而鎭定了、目前「抗先隊」對于動員台山民衆、巳成爲一龐大的團體、會員擴展到一千三百多人、工作也遍佈到每個鄕村去、在動員民眾方面、臺山還進行「國民精神總動員」擴大宣傳、由縣立各中等學校的職敎員學生組織宣偉隊、分四十隊、十人一小隊、由各校校長任鎖隊長、職敎員任小隊長、深人民間、作吏普遍的宣傳、此外、目前加緊組織鄉村保衛隊、集中武力、由團警指揮隊　一指揮、自衛武力現極堅强、若×人　意　試、無異自抽掘墳墓、</p>
<p>行政設施</p>
<p>配合着這一緊張的局面、一切行政設施、不得不抉擇適應急需的加緊推行、情况如下、</p>
<p>一、繼行保甲台山推行保甲運動、極爲熱烈、現巳開始訓練各鄉保長、第一期三百人、同時推行「五戶聯保切結』、使每五戶彼此保證、不通×助×、爲防範官員通×計、公務人員亦將推行一聯保辦法、</p>
<p>二、嚴淸烟賭台山各鄉村的烟暏之風頗盛、對於抗戰江作障礙不少、聞黄縣長現正在施行肅淸工作、肅淸辦法約略如下、（一）據得煙財犯送入救濟院、施行感化工作、（二）感化後、經該犯同意、即送往前總爲國効勞、（三）取締當敗的罰款辦法、</p>
<p>同時、積極推行戰時準備、如開發大窿洞等、巳著手開工、先架塔可容數萬人的葵棚、預備戰事發生、難民逃向那裏、第二期架搭葵砂、亦在加緊籌劃中、他如各鄉義勇警察、救護隊、交通隊、慰勞隊、工作隊……等戰時工作、亦巳在加緊準備與擴大、</p>
<p>破壞交通</p>
<p>破壞交通、爲戰時準備工作之一、最近台山的公路、已澈底破壞、新寧鐵路、也據說澈底破壞了、泰蔣委員長命、破壞時是由縣通令各區鄉分段負責破壞的、人民非常踴躣參加、現在自斗山至公益、自台城至白沙、巳無一條鋼軌或枕木、這些已付給人民做抵償工作的代價、破壞的情形是這樣的、沿途掘成了無數的窟穴、每窟穴約長五丈、闊二丈、深二丈、最近只有附城的公路、爲適應歸要計、尙有短程可通汽車、</p>
<p>米慌救濟</p>
<p>貼近火綫的台山、現已普遍地鬧着米慌」、因為台山米產只有三个月糧、一向靠洋米供給、自江鬥失陷、運輸困難、米價高漲、上米每担廿五元左右、中米每担廿三四元、最粗的米每担也要廿一元、甚至台城的米店、曾鬧過沒有米實的風潮、只有一兩家剩著三數担、限制每人只能羅四五錢、</p>
<p>爲了這、縣府當局巳從袖食調節委員會、扭出將購買槍械的存欵十二萬元、從香港辦囘洋米、目下第三批米二千餘包、巳運到台山、此批洋米、是先分配到米慌的最嚴重的區鄕去、給人民平　、規定每擔的米價十三元國幣、準備將四五枇繼續運回、分配到到他區鄉去、另外、縣府當局簽照給各商店自辦、准免　米稅、在嚴重的情形下、搶救米慌、也是台山戰象時景之一、除了米之外、醫藥問題、也是目前台山的嚴重現象、現在江會爭奪戰的協兵運回台山、就醫者繼續增加、台城各藥房所存的藥品都用完了、所以對于醫　問題、是台山目前急需解决的、不然、速囘的傷兵、是很成問題了、</p>
<p>記者會見台山各機關團體及長官時、無不股殷致囑、請代向四邑僑胞及全國同胞呼籲、「救台山的米和醫藥、」</p>

<p>英德關係</p>
<p>余與張伯倫之協定、實與捷事無關、該協定完全關於英、德兩國之各項問題、余今後之行動、仍舊依據慕尼黑之談判方式、但在張伯倫認爲慕尼黑協定、已爲吾人所毀棄、吾人亦願以此答之、余自登台以來、卽熱知英、德兩國能永持友好余嘗相信、英帝國之存在、對於人類文化及經濟、實有無上價值、但如英國對德國之利益、不加承認、則余認爲英、德欲保持永久友好實不可能唯有英、德互相援助方能保持永久友好、余曾聞張伯倫云、不再置信德國之保證、喻德民衆母用冉望英國信仟德國、唯德國自國社黨秉政以來、卽力求與英保持友好、余曾自動裁減海軍、目的乃在避免英、德戰爭、但英國如此表示、是已爲德國之敵、且巳正式宣布包圍德國、則英、德海軍協定、自當廢止、余今將此通知英政府、也余仍不欲與英競爭擴軍、不過抑採自衛步驟耳、如英願再開談判、余仍極表歡迎、並望雙方能獲諒解、（中叙德與各小國之經濟會商略）、</p>
<p>對波態度</p>
<p>目下唯一之德、波但澤問題、遲早必須解决、數日前、此間曾作數度談話、余曾向波提出數點、（一）但澤歸還德國、仍爲自由市（二）德經波蘭走廊築公路及鐵路各一條由德管理、其交換條件則爲、（一）承認波在但澤經濟欄刊、（二）在但澤為波劃一自由港（三）承認目下之德、浪國界爲求久、（四）與波簽定廿五年不侵犯協定、此協定之有效期遠超過余個人之生命、（五）德、波、匈三國共同保證斯洛代克、但波蘭已拒絕余之提議。波蘭表示僅願為下列二事、（一）進行談判以覇換但澤之國際聯盟所派委員、（二）討論便利貨在波蘭走廊之運輸、余對波蘭、此種態度、深表遺憾、但幸此尚未至絕路、所不幸者、波蘭今日又與一年前捷克相似、因國際之壓力、巳調動其軍隊、而德國固未嘗一兵一卒以抗波蘭、波蘭攻德之急實全由國際壓力所致、彼等以所謂保證加讀波政府、表示與波軍事合作、以抗敵人、波蘭參加此種行動態度、實有違於余選時與畢蘇斯基將軍所成之協定、因此、余巳通知波政府、該條約效用、巳不存在、余仍願重申此點、卽余之决定、幷無改變於余之態度、如波蘭仍願與德國重申談判、締結舊好、余自衷心歡迎、而願在平等明確之基點、共同討論、歐洲局勢之紊亂、完全由於國際戰爭挑動者、蓄意使歐洲、陷入苦難、今歐洲文化淪人布爾希維克之災患、此種詭計在西班牙、因德、意援助英雄主義之故、乃吿失敗、目下各方一意造成英國將領導包園吾人之信念而獲漁利、吾人現仍堅持與意日兩國密切合作、以應付將來、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>勉粵省參議員</h3>
<p>抗戰還在勝和前夕的艱險的過度皆段，國家民族還在生死存亡　關頭，如何化險爲夷出死人生，主要還賴民主政治的實施，以　實現全國民衆力量的總動員，擁護政府堅持抗戰。參政會及參議會，雖然尙非眞止的民主政治形態，亦非中山先生平生倡導的國民曾議可比，但自　高領袖的訓詞以至過去三屆參政會的成績，至少呆以確認其能爲民主政治奠定始基，而於抗戰時期改善政治機構，增强政府威信發揮民衆力量，意義尤爲重大。</p>
<p>最近各省參議會先後成立或準備成立，而粵省參議員名單，亦經國府明令公布據粵省參議會議長昨日談話，粵參議會秘書處於本月廿一日在韶成立，留港參議員多人，亦卽將赴韶出席將于五月中旬召開時第一屆會議云云。我們對於政府之努力于促使各省市參議會之成立與對之特別重視。謹表無　的敬佩。尤其是粵省今日之處境　不有關革命策源地之廣東的未來，並且對於整個戰局，對於整個國家民族的未來，都有重大的關係，因此我們對於粵省參議員諸君，尤不能不寄以殷切的期望。</p>
<p>我們細考國府公佈的粵省參議員名單，羣彥濟濟，至感欣慰。但仍認爲今後有須為意者，第一，必須增加各地各黨派有權威的份子，以收集思廣益之效，第二，對於過去在廣東努力抗×救亡工作者有成效而且在羣衆中有威信的份子，今後尙有待於大量吸收；第三，對於華僑代表婦女代表以及農工各界代表，似乎亦嫌不足，今後必須注意於此各界有力份子的吸牧。此外尤爲重要的，是名單內所本能發見青年學辦的代表，我們回憶中山先生在一九二五年大革命序慕卽將展開之時，曾經一再諄諄致意於國民大會中必須列有屆年為生代表，始能有裨於國家民族的重與大業，甚望粵省參議會能仰體革命導師的遺訓，明鑒抗戰建國的需要與靑年學生的力量，力謀補救之道。</p>
<p>以上僅就充實參議會力量方面，略舉數點，我們謹以愛國家　政府的至誠，以爲要求當議會之確能克盡其戰時民意機關與轉佐政府推　抗戰建國大　的職責，則此數點，似當首須重以注意。尤望參議員諸君對此特別盡力，促其實現。以壽為民代表的責任。</p>

<p>反對派工黨領袖阿德里在熱烈采聲中起立發言、將渠修改原文加以宣讀謂『當吾人準備採取必要步驟、以維護國家之安全及履行國際之責任時：』又謂「全國反抗任何侵略之决心向未有如此次之堅决者、渠等已準備犧性、以求自由與民主、然對於徵兵之舉、加以反對、因當現時需要增强國力與團結之際、徵兵制度反足以刖弱及分裂國力也、吾人巳俱决心、與任何他人相同、謀在各方面增强英國之國防、使能履行其責任、阻止戰爭之發生、及擊退侵略之行動、工黨之堅决反對武力侵略、實較政府爲尤甚他、關于徵兵年齡之限制、盡　徵用靑年、　非處置人力之正當辦法、蓋關於防空等國防業務、應實行徵用退伍之海陸軍人員也、且依陸軍部過去之經騐、戰時之眞正困難　在缺乏供應部之組織、因戰時物料需要之急實甚於人力、首相張伯倫未有强徵國人財力之舉、殊屬不當、吾人對於非必要之奢侈、應加壓制也、工會對徵兵制、甚表疑憂、因此步驟將引起强迫徵用工人之舉也」、</p>
<p>辛克萊</p>
<p>阿德里言畢、自由黨領袖辛克萊繼起宣稱『此次徵兵之舉、對於外國、必有影響、例如美國與蘇聯、英國必須將此事、向法國明白解釋、聲明英國之貢献、完全與其全國人民及資源爲比例、余深信自由服役制度極有利益、政府實行徵兵之理由、爲如不施行此制、則不能獲得國防所需之人力、但徽兵之後、欲於數月內完成武裝設備、將不能實現也、如環境變遷、必須廢除自願服役制、余望徽兵制僅應用於二十歲之靑年」、</p>
<p>邱吉爾</p>
<p>保守黨要員邱吉爾對於微兵之舉、表示贊　與擁護、渠謂、政府實行征兵實爲保障國家安全所必要之步驟、政府此舉對於保障和平實有直接之影響、反對此舉對、必已遺忘嚴重之責任、若此舉以投票取决、政府方面亦將獲得勝利、如反對黨獲得勝利、則將描翻微兵原則、而歐洲抵抗納粹覇權之力量、亦將整個崩潰矣、法人之觀感、可引用例、法人　謂『假設德艦於下週製擊直布羅陀、則數日閒將有法軍二百萬、與德相抗矣』、關於希特勒明日發表演說事、邱吉爾認爲無須重視、渠謂『余對希氏演講、不加注意、若渠發表恫嚇之詞、則亦不能使目前之實際情勢、更趨惡劣、若渠發表保證之語、則在未經行動證實之前、余將不予相信、若渠發表責難之言、吾人可置之不理、吾人過份注意獨裁者之演詞、而忽略其軍事佈置及其勢力之伸張、殊非得計也』、至此、復經多人發言後、政府之動議卒獲採納、</p>

<h3>閩西贛南沿綫上（續）</h3>
<p>— 莫憑欄</p>
<p>横貫瑞金的綿江，簡直是一支黄色的河流。尤其是當春雨連綿的季節，全城用的全是拖泥帶沙的黄水，喝湯不用茶葉已呈黄色，飲料的淸潔，在瑞金確是一個重要的保　問題。瑞金的住民非常嗜好酒，平常居家不備茶壺，但備酒壺。因爲瑞金是山間的一個小平原，物產相當豐裕，人民便懶惰起來。人民習性雖懶惰，民風却强悍樸　。據瑞金縣司法處主任書　官談，自本年度以來，該處不曾接受過一件民事案，而刑事案件却每月有十五椿之多。因民風强悍，平常有小事故發生爭執。多不經於打官司，一打起官司，便多是了不起的人命大案</p>
<p>瑞金在今日，實是　，贛，粵三省的十字交通站，閩湘幹綫横貫而過，西有瑞雲路，北有寧鄔支綫，瑞寧公路，南有瑞會公路，形勢日益重要，贛北的烽火已燃過了修河，贛南重鎭的瑞金，不該再讓它沉睡下去，應震醒起來，正是現實，担負起供給贛北前綫的實際責任，這是記者對瑞金的祝望，</p>
<p>記者在瑞金等北上車勾留了三日，像一个貶客侷促於狹小的天地，苦悶得很。贛北緊急，贛南總不免有許多流言，有的說，南昌已下令疏散人口。有的說甯都南下車遭日機低飛掃射，司機受傷。記者在半信半疑中，更急於探詢個究竟，便到車站查問什麽時候有車北行，似乎前線很緊急，站長室的電話機治終未有過停息，對於乘客的要求，站長都是搖着頭，沒有答應，後來實在敷衍不過了，指着車裏躺着呻吟司機，吿訴記者寗都甫下車駛到近瑞金三十里左右時，爲匪徒所刼，盡忠職務的司機　車直衝，中了兩彈，旅客幸無傷亡，這輛車準備載受傷司機，到後方醫院治療，記者再三要求附車北行，未果，後來承江西省政府一位副官的好意，答應載記者到寗都再定進退，於下午一時，負有重要任務的三輛載重汽車，滿載着軍需品，向率都直馳，路上肥者無心欣賞公路兩傍的白色綠肥，只假寐着休養精神。</p>
<p>車抵寧都後，記者下楊於車站旁的大公旅社。寧都的物價眞低廉，每天四角銀的房間，食宿都在內，飯菜還相當的好。寧都人像是對昔日食鹽封鎖的報復，調味時拚命用鹽，唯恐不够鹽。梅江和綿江一樣，同是貢水上流，梅江的水却比綿江稍深些，不像瑞金那樣，溪洪一冲，全城就要全喝黄土水</p>
<p>甯那是古甯州治，現江西第八區專員公署所在地。刦後荒凉，元氣還未完全恢復，城　貢上流，梅江西岸四面山嶺環繞，中間一塊平原，良田萬頃，不能不算是山間富庶之區。西北有金精山，十二个峯各盡其妙。十二峯中，以翠徵峯最爲奇絕，四面如削，頂上平曠，歷代有亂，邑人多避難於此。</p>
<p>寗都的城堞，簡直難於找出。殘堞荒蕪，野革叢生，偶爾有些紀念碑，多呈赤扛色，据甯都友人王君的見解，遺因爲江西地質以赤砂巖層爲主的緣故。城　和民房上，貼遍各種各色的標語，圖畫，最新而又最刺眼的，是江西省政府的靑年服務團，和江西省黨部的第八區工作團所繪寫的醒目宣傳品。記者在寗都勾留一日，除了看到一些宣傳字畫，不曾見有其他有力的震撼，各方面的印象，都淡泊得幾乎忘記了是在離火線只有二百多公里的第二線。</p>
<p>西江的保學是馳名全國的，保學，是跟保甲制度新興的一種民敎組織，也就是兼　普及敎育和實施成人補習敎育的一種組織。它的最後目的，要達到一管敎養衛」合一，所以在江西省設立保學暫行辦法上有這樣規定：「各縣保學以所在地之整個社會爲施敎範園，全部民衆爲施敎對象」，其理想和廣西省的基礎敎育，福建省的國民敎育相似，辦得好，保學實是江西同胞的精神搖籃。可是，江西今日雖擁有一萬五千所的保學，依記者在瑞金和寧都的觀感，因設備的簡　，經費的困難，待遇的過差，都足以妨碍保學的發達。贛北的神聖保衛戰已展開了，作爲後方的贛南，更應力求整頓保學，以符精神動員的偉大號召。記者個人管見，要求保學的改善，充實，贛南應從速加强保甲本身的組織和活動，謀保學經濟的穩定，愼選師資，限制完成保學的初期任務，以求取得實際需要和呼應。</p>
<p>記者在寗都勾留一天，南昌已陷敵手，欲再行北上報導實情，客車巳不通，載記者來寗都的三輛軍用車，也於昨夜火速北行，一個人被遺留在冷落的寗鄧，心中憂鬰得很，贛北的烽火决　到贛中了，贛南要到什麽時候才能站起脊骨來呢？</p>
<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>無線電影宣告成功　金門博覽會首度公開展覽　亞爾西愛公司興建攝影場</h3>
<p>無線電影，這個喧嘩了好久屬於電子的科學奇聞，現在是終究成為事實了，那是由亞兩西愛無線電公司中的科學家們宣吿的。</p>
<p>在這次參觀美國舊金山金門　覽會的賓客們，是不特目睹有眞正的家用無綫電影機，他們還可以有一次親身夫做無線電影機上顯映出來的主角的機會，根據美國無線電公司職員們所說，這是在美國太平洋沿岸第一次最大電力的公開的無線電影秘密的被演。</p>
<p>亞爾西愛無線電公司現正在興建一座佔有五千方尺地面的大廈，備作無絲電影攝影場及放映室之用，節目是有新聞件的報吿，影片及其他等等，甚至在居家都可以收看，眞是充分　示出無線　藝術的代表。</p>
<p>對於外來的參觀者，由管理員直接領導到無線電影的攝影場去，那兒他們可以立在無線電影攝影機的電眼前，而使別個同來的人，在毗的鄰一間屋子裏，從無線電影機上看到他的形和聽得他的聲，而他自己也可以從一面玻璃窗中看見他們，燈光的配備，是像在拍攝普通影片的攝影場中一般重要，所以也預備必要地照耀着。</p>
<p>在　形室中，從無線電影機收影管的表面上，可以看見有直接的或是從一面玻璃上反射出來的黑白肖象，這種收影管表面的直徑有十二英寸，而　映在上面的肖像，則是近乎有八至十二英寸的大小。</p>
<p>在攝影場中，有收影和傳影二部，後者的一端，裝置顯影管（電眼），以通連到一架普通攝影機的底片上去，此外，這　影管又有使屬於光學的肖像，受到電力感應的功效。攝影機的透光鏡是用來集中物體到一塊金屬片上的。他的上面是塗有無數微小的影液膠。而有着强大的感光力足以顯出精確的黑白，肖像在顯影管的另外一端是一把電　。他是指揮電子封光線，在很快的前後作一移動後，使肖像受了電力的感應而在金屬片上定影、，至於在收影方面。有着收影管的配備。相反那傳遞進來的順序，並且放大肖像和控制電力的強弱。這種電力是投擲到發光面上，經過很快的前後作移動後，便成造圖像來了。他的速度是快速極咖，每小時可以經過四千五百英里，而結果使我們肉眼可以在任何時間內看到圖像。</p>
<h3>影中人語</h3>
<p>影中人語，在局外人聽了，會覺得莫名其妙，此亦如我輩非揚帮人之上剃頭店，看見一個漂亮女人進來，掃淸碼子就嘰哩咕嚕、雖明知道他們是在評頭品足，然而，究竟是好是歹，祇有他們自己知道，影城裏有時也是這樣，雖然，影城不是剃頭店。</p>
<p>這裏，我想把影人隱語公開一下，也　使影迷們明瞭意義，不過在下也非通人，僅舉所知者幾點而已。</p>
<p>（一）一廠二廠　就是妻妾的意思，影城中人稱髪妻爲總廠，對妾則曰分廠，至於三廠四廠，則須視各人的經濟力量了。</p>
<p>（二）跟鏡頭　急色兒在公園裏發現目標，伊走我也走，伊停我也停，此上海人所謂「甲乙丙」，而影人口中的「跟鏡頭」，其意也在此。</p>
<p>（三）對福克斯　進攻一物，必須認淸其焦點，故對屬克斯不可不愼，火山朋友，對舜女各有所好，而投以灼灼目光，此卽所謂對　克斯也。</p>
<p>（四）放聲　　譜如甲乙二人，欲看南京「比翼　飛」而沒有錢時，丙恰在旁邊，而被正袋裏麥克麥克者，於是甲對乙道：「你今天也該請請客，看電影兒啦」，乙口答道：「請客嗎？不要攞在心上，要是我今天有錢的話，非但請你去看，同時我連丙先生一起請去」，這時如果丙先生自動擠上來，說『我請你們』，這就是放聲帶的成功，放聲帶妙在放者態度自若，而被放者不覺中了帶計，這在影人中，就我所知，首推韓蘭根君。</p>
<p>（五）推鏡頭　這個鬧玩笑的名詞。我不便直率解釋，好在讀者聰明人或可照字眼自去領會。</p>
<p>（六）　香賓　騎師欲跑頭馬，在馬屁股上必大拍特拍，乾脆說，跑香賓就是拍馬屁。</p>
<p>（七）開綠　　其意義與跑香賓同。</p>
<p>（八）拷貝機　稱妻妾爲廠，然也有叫做拷貝機者，某人娶婚剛半年，已經麥了一個兒子，便說這部拷貝機一定來路　。否則數年而不得半子一女，也許拷貝機出毛病，有檢視必要，於是須請醫生。</p>
<p>其他，一時倒想不起來，待有機會再寫給讀者看吧</p>

<p>『不，若是一枚炸彈投中了，地窖裏只有更瓖。』這時，外面空氣，突然變成異常嚴肅，恐怖。裏面，只有他兩人姑在黑暗中。</p>
<p>『我愛你，哈立。』她簡單的說。「你也喜歡我，是不是，親愛的？」</p>
<p>「我這樣說過囑？」</p>
<p>『當然沒有，你一定不承認的。你二定不會改掉你的作風。』</p>
<p>哈立不說什麽，只是親切的吻着她的櫻唇，她陶醉的輕輕嘆息着，跑到窗前，向外望着。</p>
<p>『哈立。』她驚奇的喊着。張大着兩眼，看着外面的火光，『你義覺得全世界都入了戰爭嗎？』</p>
<p>哈立正坐在琴前，按着琴鍵。『我但可別想是的是了問我是爲什麽，我已　經不要去想像它。』</p>
<p>『我知道是爲什麽，它的目的無非是要殺死我們！你和我，因爲我們是小百姓，並且，爲了我們，這些殺人利器還是可惜了。哈立，你會彈聖歌嗎？』</p>
<p>『當然會，』她於是開始彈奏『救世軍曲』跟着紆緩，莊肅的調子，他唱起來了，愛琳從窗口移到他的身後，雙手放在他的肩上，外面戰爭的聲浪激增，愛琳附和着哈立唱着：</p>
<p>前進，救世軍，</p>
<p>負着基督的十字架，向戰爭邁進………</p>
<p>炸彈擲中了蒙　羅達飯店，牆壁和樓板都被開始碎製，戰爭的火焰呑食了哈立和愛琳，但是，他們的歌聲似乎更響亮，淸晰，無所畏懼，升高，升到沒有止境。　（完）</p>

<h3>今日加山足球大戰　東方海軍爭亞軍　許文奎曹秋亭二人登場演身手</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】甲組足球聯賽、去星期六日南華南大破海軍、榮膺冠軍、至是亞軍形勢、隨之變化、　海軍旣爲南南擊敗、其所得織分、適與東方相同、故尚須舉行亞軍决戰、方定維屬、</p>
<p>海軍自足球季開始以迄現在、經數月之奮鬥、因戰績甚佳、其地　常居於一二名之間、且曾一度超過南南、奪標呼聲　高、孰知晚節難持、功虧一筆、旣為南南所敗、奪標美夢、乃被打破、甚至亞軍希望、亦不絕如縷、如此數奇、可謂運厄之全、</p>
<p>冠軍　失、冀獲亞軍、雖則聊勝於無　然此亦是光榮之物、故料海軍對今日一役、誓必力爭、而欲收諸桑榆、但是球運若戰之　、成敗未可卜也、</p>
<p>東方自入第二循環賽後、常走順境、且保持未背失收之紀錄、如此戰功、堪稱難得、及舉師南征、亦所向多捷、以九戰七勝、和敗　一之美滿成績、戰譽歸來、復有上海名將許文奎、曹秋亭二人、今日登　効力、全軍完整、對勝利殊有把握、若一戰而捷、則我華隊　辦審組聯賽冠亞軍之創作、又得完成矣、</p>
<p>東方所定陣線、與以前略　、守門一職、以徐亨在西貢三戰、均有良好表演、故今日仍用之祖任、內衛兩人、亦有更動、因苗華國南征抉傷歸來、尚須休養、故左內衛職、乃調羅偉權代之、與羅搭　者、則爲以前名馳上海之江善敬、江業稱梟勇、爲內　之特出人材、今東方邀其參戰、誠慶得人、惟羅乃由前衛調後、江則初與合作、未悉位置與聯絡、有無不慣、故此點頗　得注意也、</p>
<p>宋　聖足踝受傷、經月未愈、致南征之行、　得參與、今日亦不見名列榜上、而以曾仲雲把守中堅、曾固善於位置戰、可不受影響、惟於洽興居左方、適遇海軍之岩士德郎、以抵禦之力、或有未逮耳、</p>
<p>依我所見、東方防衛國面、因多有更調、似不無瑕隙、若樂志成城、爲勝是務、則努力之下、自可輛補不足、否則前衛一線、難免露出破綻、或致被海軍前鋒乘隙侵進也、</p>
<p>前鋒線因侯澄滔有非島之行、致少一擅衛　射人物、然得曹秋亭補上、此子亦矯捷絕倫、能衝能射、與侯有略同之作風、觀諸此次南征、射球至多者、捨李德祺外、便爲曹氏、今日出任左翼、當無傷大體也、</p>
<p>總之、東方前線、編配固完善、適　以威脅海軍而無疑、亦足以發揮威力而致勝、惟可慮者、其防銜力量、未易制肘海軍前鋒之進展、故吾料定此役東方之勝負關鍵、不在前線而在後方、若其防衛得法、呼應週到、而能保守不失者、則左券可操、</p>
<p>邇來天氣、晴雨無常、今日若又下雨、東方固不慣水戰、則影響實大、但願老天放晴、多予方便、</p>
<p>海軍陳容、與去週戰南南時略不同、蓋韓尼維路已隨港埠際隊出發征菲、故左前衛職、將調烈厘担任、中堅他能、亦巳他去、代之者勞路斯、而前鋒線亦小有更動、整個實力、不若戰南南時之充厚、如東方各員於努力之下、復知聯實樂虛、當不難勝之、奪亞軍爲己有也</p>
<p>比賽地點在加路連山、下午四時三刻開戰、兩陣如下、（太歲）</p>

<p>自由談「豔」和「韻」的方統  五陵　　我們一向是看不起女子的，但有時即又特別的看得起女子。　　在歷史上，每當一不「太平」的時候，大家便安女子給國家體商了，那爭體面的方法是：「死」。「賊」來了，家主逃命，女子死，死，死。外族侵入了，文官主和，武將投降；女子死，死，死。　　死了以後怎樣呢？於是我們底文學家跳出來：弔詩？輓詩，你步韻，我步龍：甚至先偷偷地做一首或是從甚麼地方抄了首，勉強栽在外人頭上，說是某烈女底絕命詩，接着再和一首，又是你步韶，我步韻。而這就叫作「斃聞」『韻事』，爲的是依然是爭體面。　　在歷史上，「賊」級我們助成的「艷聞」「韻事」也為多得很。但所謂「賊」，便是「流寇」，却都是皇帝和官僚　出來的。倘沒有皇帝和官僚，也不就不會有「艷聞」「韻事」了。因之，我們底文學家　來便都擁護　皇帝和官僚。外族的侵入助成我們的「艷聞」「韻事」更加多了，像金人，元人，滿人，那些成績，我們還容易查考出來的。這些外族一面直接製造了「豔聞」「韻事」，一面到後却都又成了皇帝和官僚，所以我們底文學家到頭還是乾脆地擁護，不管他媽的外族不外族。證據便是那些統傳的弔詩，輓詩，和詩，步韻詩，從來就沒有寫過皇帝和官僚，也沒有罵過外族的淫掠，只是併命地在「豔」和「韻」上做着工夫。自然，這是「為藝術的　飛」。但終於在這時候也就露出了「尾巴」：所爭的體面樓實在不是國家底體面，却只是活得健旺的幾個男子底體面罷了。　　但是若果有幾個女子偏不肯死又怎樣呢？那豈不是太伶落太文學家嗎？然而又並不。文學家底主意多得很。現在他們是一面罵那女子，一面冉捧那女子。罵是馬她沒有廉恥，棒是她臉子好看，於是依然是「豔聞」「韻事」，這囘的「豔」和「韻」更加要『醫』得厲害，『韻』得厲害，結果這囘的體面却完全屬於文學家了。　　以上說的自然都是已往的情形，至於現代，卻稍微有一點變化，女子再不肯死得那樣起勁了，體面雖然還是要的。但也只好另想法子，不過我們底文學家卻似乎還抱着已往的主張不放，依然在追求着艷」和「韻」，然而因為畢竟是現代，追求的方法也一樣的有了變化，而且也再不赤裸裸地打出「豔」和「韻」招牌了，有的是更大的頣目。　　幾年前前在北平的文學家很熱心地在訪　金花，吹賽金花，約　金花談話，睛賽金，吃飯，結果一本一本的書出來了據說是爲由她底口中考出滿清未年的許多掌故的故但是刻却又說原來她知識太差，竟考不出來，雖在　人　望。然而雖然失望伯書，還是要出的。於是書中沒有掌故，誇一通淸太后，讀一通德元帥，寫一通「拳匪」陪襯出來上個「豔」和「韻」完事。　　上海打仗了，一個炸彈落在了「大世界」底門前，窮人，工人，小商人，眞不知道死了多少。可是一位交豪由別處來了，經過了這個地方，便做了一首詩，說他好像看見了那兒還有着有炸斷了的摩登女子底染　了的指甲，別的却一塊沒有看見，這眞「豔」得很，「韻」得很。　　這囘要創作明末的歷史作品了。於是有文學家出來講話：壓史題材非選擇不可。自然這是對的。但選來選去，却只選出了一個陳圓圓，據說比明未并陰等等地方抗戰的義民要有意義得，自然，陳圓圓底背境是複雜的，但志麼却比抗戰的義民還要有意義呢？這初聽去似乎是費解得很，然而，要你知道我們文學家骨子裏面的主張，便會立刻豁然。陳圓圓　能「豔」，又能「韻」，在這登點上，那些義民只有「自慚形穢」了。　　追求「豔」和「韻」，是我們底「文統」。失掉了這個「文統」，我們底文學也評不會有「靈感」吧。豐川江口  杜文慧　　深秋九月。江岸上放滿一堆堆秋收後底枯黃的禾草。在迷茫的晨霧中好像一個個小炮壘的豚在那裏，從這些禾堆的間隔望過去，是一毗毗迎綿不盡的，茶乾色的大地。收割後的阡陌上這裏那裏地樹着乾枯了的禾頭，在　遠的銀色的天空下底遠處，露出一些村莊的秋林底淡綠，朝霧是史深濃了，秋之田園，彷彿膠着在甜膩的糖漿中。　　江水是黃濁的，無盡止的向着莫名的地方流去，我們十多隻載滿磚瓦的大木船，正循着西江的上游浩浩蕩蕩的流下去。我巳是醒來了。在順流的江水雖然是無波，然而在這旅途中底動蕩的船上，我是從沒閉過眼的。我心緒總感到不安，我整晚靜聽着江水澎湃的聲音，和那些小汽船上哮喘似的摩托聲，有時，我也用一雙疲憊的眼，從艙的小洞裏望着那些朝上游駛去的拖渡，小火輪　尖銳的笛聲，飄鴻在死寂的夜空，以至江岸之外的遠方。這「勃勃」的音波好像洪濤似的搖撼着找底船艙，搖撼脅我這旅人的心緒。於是，我整夜凝望着黑空閃耀的繁星，望着一些在黑暗中迷茫地消失去的村林茅舍。以至我底眼皮在不知不覺中睡去了。　　天明，使我獲得蘇甦，正如囚徒這獲得　處一樣。我跑上船面的甲板，坐在那些鋪滿禾草的磚塊之上，我望看江岸兩傍的景色，我望着　　的大邊的曙光，我底心感釗一股沉響的虛空，深秋的江風是微寒的，有點使人留戀的意味，我愛秋，因爲我生長於南國，狄曾給過我很多熱烈的記憶，曾給過我生之意志的鼓舞。然而在這秋晨，我是沒有一點子依戀的，我覺得這秋變了，這兩岸的景色以至江水也變了，它是在受難中，它是在敵人殘皓的轟炸與蹂躪中，一切都變得如江岸上的阡陌一機死寂，變得如江水一樣靜靜的。　　天已是大白，朝陽的金光業和地瀉在茶乾色的大地，江岸的枯禾堆以及混濁的江水之下，晨霧是漸漸溶解以至消失了，遙遠的村莊底叢林和黑屋脊都淸晰可辨，我們的船頗着風像是走得很快的，灰蔴色的帆桅在秋風中顫抖。我們的船巳駛進豐川江了，豐川江是西江的支流，這兒的水是很淺的，因此，夥伴們使忙起來了。有些執丈把長的竹篙，在那些游泥或浮灘之上划着。　　（未完）「神曲」漏下的故事  楊彥岐　　但丁邊邊地獄。　　我在人間也見到了地獄的故事。　　時閒：一個凄凉的午夜。午夜的氣象原是凄凉的，又加上幾點小雨，更顯得陰沉。　　地點：冷靜的街道旁邊。洋槐葉子在抖，抖出索索瑟瑟的聲音，像鬼神嘆氣。　　我在路旁跨着不快也不慢的步子，這時候，還算是冬天吧：冬天的雨點是最殘忍的東西，打作沒有戴帽的頭上，打亂了頭　，又流到額角，成一條小瀑布，一直掛到眼邊。大衣的領子翻得很高，可是擋不住冬夜的尖風，和風裏的雨水。冷，想抖，沒抖成。祇是，跨着不快也不慢，不大也不小的步子。　　一拐灣，更會沉了。路燈的微光，見了我害羞，躲在灰色的玻璃罩里露着一半亮。在燈前光里，看見雨點速成一條條細線，銀色的，閃着、在風里斜下來。這是玻璃絲，不是雨，我想。　　街頭沒有別人，只剩下我一個靈魂。　　樹影，在昏淡的光下，　了滿地。　　天上沒有顏色，祇是黑暗，滿眼空虛。　　老遠，來一聲狗吠，衝破暫時的沉寂，可是打不掉凄凉的空氣。冷，暗，淸靜的路上，只有孤獨的人影。誰會想到呢，世界上除了我之外，竟還有二十萬萬個人！　　看，前面灰白高牆脚下，凹進大門口，就趴着一個黑影。動了，閃過來了是的一個人。　　平靜的空氣里，激動了。這平靜的境地，有了兩個活動的人，兩個靈魂。　　迎着光望過去，那人影很淸楚的儿立在眼前。他面孔上，却剛好一片葉子遮着了光，沒讓我看見，只有，黑影上好像有一個墨髮。拖下幾根，披在額上。　　一身涼，走吧，步子跨得大了些，快了些。　　忽然，滴噠的足音，跟着我來，是黑影的人物，喘急氣，跟着我來。不聽他一聲哀歡，只有滴噠的足昔，掛在風雨的輕聲合奏中。　　「還來！我失去的生命！」猛然　我肩，一聲瞅。　　我一陣慌，只有笑。　　『我失去了生命』！帶血的喉嚨，快迸出火星。　　「醉漢！」　　『不是醉！我祗要失去的生命！我的靈魂！我要你教我，救我！還我生命，靈魂。』　　我一陣狂笑。　　乎裏忽然，　來一張白紙。揑得很皺了。趁着路靈的暗光，看。他却趁我看時，溜跑了，只剩了一聲滴噠的足音。　　頭探過去，壓在路燈的淡光下面。紙上，赫然：　　「虹口通行證」五個大字。　　原來……　　街頭又祇刺我一個人，雨色的風，瘦的燈。劣貨的美術化裝  張鎭山　　在經濟崩潰的前夜，以歪巧的欺騙方式把貨品來一下「美術的化裝」，傾銷於國外市場，而博取原料和資財，這的確是極卑鄙而也是極可憐的策略。　　在他們，也許以爲把這種貨品緊隨着鐵蹄而來，是實行其變管齊下的侵略，然而，在我們，任你改頭換面的手法如向精巧，也只會被朦混一時，絕對不會對他發生信仰，而相反的只有獻惡唾棄。　　內地，無論那一處，人民愛國的熱忱，與夫民族意識的高深，把生活都抗戰化了，一切日常服用的物品都以國貨爲主，仇貨在內地簡直是無法立脚，因而，就產生了東施效顰，忸怩作態，希冀魚目混珠的玩意。他們的產品，起初祇不過在包裝的外部標上「國貨」字樣，而貨品本體上却仍有很顯明的國籍標出，現在呢，這種手法可說是進步了，連貨品的本體上也「美化」起來，有的竟標示着：「在中國製造」，或者「上海製造」。所用的商標也日新月異，忽而用人，忽而　狗，忽而又用豬，並且還會用能够迎合國人心理的事物爲商標。印上「純粹國貨」的字樣，或者胃充其他國籟的出品，上面寫着：Made　in……　　再經過爲虎作倀的奸商們口頭宣傳上，於是就得僥悻混人於國貨堆中。然而，他們這樣做作，非但不足以獲得市場地位，而且適足以反映出內地人民對於民族觀念的堅貞，反映出內地人民對於民族經濟有充分的認識；他　胃充國　愈多，就愈顯出國人愛國思想的濃厚；非國貨就不能在內地立足，這眞是可喜的一件事。　　在上海生活而熟悉地方情况的人，對於貨品的辨別力旣强，自然就不易受欺，誤購劣貸。譬如：某種物品上表寫明「上海製造」，那末祇要腦筋稍爲想一下，上海是否有製造這種物品的廠商？卽有，又是否爲國人經營？所用原料又是否國產？有了這淺近的辦別法式，誰也不會冒眛購買的。　　可是，在內地就不然，一般不明瞭上海情況的人，往往以爲在上海製造，總是國貨，因此，補救之法，就非得要當局積極地來一個有效的查禁不可。　　所以，經濟部現在分電湘，贛，黔，籽等省府轉飭直接主管機關，嚴行緝查（見報載）。嗣後各項劣貨，冒牌也好，改裝也好，換名也好，恐怕都雞以越過這道防線。對於代爲改裝運銷的奸商也有處罰的明文，這非但在稅收上有相當良好的影響，而對於內　人的購買方面也有不少便利，可以不必望而猶豫，是國貨才能出售，劣貨自然就難得到焦目混珠之效了。　　目前的游擊區，右其是『孤島』，國貨的確相當的少，市場上隨時可以看見冒牌改裝之類的劣品，卽不經化妝　皇旱然銷售的也多；關於這，我們祇有希望一般人把自私毀滅於公益之下，加深民族經濟的認識，警覺着毀壞我們的火力是從何而來了假若仔細地　想，就會相信：「自己手中的錢，轉個灣，就製成了炸彈，炸及自身……」這幾句話的，是經騐之談，快覺悟罷！祇要我們堅决不買，任他怎樣聰明，黔驢之技畢竟是無用的。滿洲的雪  舒羣　　她望着其中唯一的相識者，握住一個殘缺的體頭，像窮實之狗得一塊　頭一樣，一邊貧食，一邊吝嗇，誰知道那饅就會機害昨夜暴徒的勇敢呢？就會泯滅今日的一憫靑年的莊嚴呢？就會使人忘形於細嚼之中？對他，他又有了新的感覺，新的認識。　　在她這癡呆的凝視中，他被凝視得呆癡；他停下暫時的吃食，問她：　　『你想吃嗎？』　　她呆癡地搖着頭。　　『你怎麼不去吃呢？』　　這時候，她慚愧，說不出主要的理由，而　說：　　『我不餓！』　　然後，她把那小面包和中奶權來，送給他，被他分成　等的三份，隨　他的二個同志一同珍惜地吃　。她拖過一隻椅子坐下，把頭探進她那唯一相識的身邊，茫然地問着：　　『你們每天吃的，就是饅頭嗎？』　（五一）</p>

<h3>Japan's Anti-British Sentiment and British Resilience</h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches from Peiping, "The anti-British movement in various areas under Chinese occupation is intensifying." Also, according to Japanese sources, "An anti-British movement has also erupted in Mongolia, with anti-British rallies being held." In Kaifeng, an anti-British, anti-French, and anti-Soviet rally was held on the 24th of this month. Japan's instigation of its puppet regimes to engage in xenophobia, especially anti-British sentiment, has reached a fever pitch.</p>
<p>Japan's anti-foreign and anti-British movement did not begin today. As early as when Fascist right-wing leader General Sueyoshi was serving as Minister of Home Affairs, the anti-Chinese movement in Japan was already stamped with the Japanese government's trademark. The president of the Japanese Toa Dobun Kai, Seigo Nakano, also repeatedly wrote articles last year attacking Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. However, this time, Japan's anti-foreign movement has taken on two distinct characteristics: (1) relaxing pressure on the United States, the Soviet Union, and France while concentrating attacks on Britain alone; (2) not coming forward itself but indirectly instigating puppet regimes to carry it out. This has profound implications for a new stage.</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers regard Britain's recent active support for China as an unfriendly move. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun's special issue headlines and all newspapers unanimously asserted: If Britain persists in its traditional Far East policy, Japan must abandon its hitherto cooperative attitude and strengthen its resolve to adopt new countermeasures in its British policy. This is a powerful signal. In the recent past, Seigo Nakano even brought his loudspeaker to Shanghai to rant, saying that British and Japanese interests in China are diametrically opposed and that if Japan retreats, Britain will expand. Therefore, he advocated , even saying that the two major Anglo-Saxon nations are Japan's true enemies. Although Nakano's views do not fully represent the Japanese government's policy, they fully reflect the current trends in the consciousness of Japanese aggressors.</p>
<p>Under Japan's direction, the puppet organizations in the occupied areas of China have successively launched so-called anti-British associations and anti-British meetings, issued anti-British declarations, distributed anti-British leaflets, and held anti-British parades, instilling anti-British ideas, and other wild acts, bizarre and unbelievable. A deep investigation into Japan's motives for actively opposing Britain reveals no more than (1) retaliation for Britain's active support for China; (2) threatening and intimidating Britain; (3) coercing Britain to make concessions to Japan while coming forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. However, this third attempt has completely failed. Japan's future policy towards Britain may, out of shame and anger, intensify the anti-British movement even further. But we must recognize that the intimidating gestures of the aggressor trapped in distress are hollow. If Britain takes further steps , then it will not be Britain that softens and yields, .</p>
<p>Today, the interests of Britain and Japan are irreconcilable, but the relative strengths of the two sides are vastly different. Internationally, Japan seeks a peaceful compromise with democratic countries but cannot achieve it, yet it dares not simply form a military alliance with the totalitarian states of Germany and Italy. Britain, on the other hand, only needs to summon the courage to move directly towards the creation of an anti-aggression front, and the majority of countries in the world will follow suit. On domestic issues, Japan still faces many powerful obstacles that prevent it from completely befriending Germany and Italy while feuding with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Britain, on the other hand, only needs its current government to boldly embark on the path of sanctioning world aggressors, and not only will internal political turmoil not arise, but the position of the current government will be further consolidated. Recently, frequent meetings between Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and Minister of War Itagaki have been entirely for the purpose of considering the increasingly deteriorating environment. Britain, on the other hand, holds the power to worsen Japan's deteriorating environment. Britain has no reason to fear Japan's anti-British sentiment.</p>
<h3>(Below) [May Fourth], A Glorious Page in Modern Chinese History</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>The "May Fourth" Movement is the most glorious page in modern Chinese history. The May Fourth Movement consolidated the foundation of the political movement led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and it also opened up the broad path for the cultural revolution, social revolution, and even national revolution of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The facts of the May Fourth Movement are as follows: During the European War, Japanese imperialism took advantage of the situation to seize Germany's colonies in China and coerced Yuan Shikai into signing the Twenty-One Demands that harmed China. This created the national humiliation memorial days of "May Seventh" and "May Ninth." After Yuan Shikai's death, the Anfu clique led by Duan Qirui colluded with the Japanese and carried out a large loan of 500 million, signing the so-called joint defense military agreement, allowing the Japanese all wartime rights in China, such as managing the Jiaoji Railway and extensively hiring Japanese advisors. At the same time, Duan Qirui used the excuse of participating in the war to obtain the so-called "Nishihara Loans" of 144 million yen from the Japanese. At that time, Japanese troops were also allowed to be stationed in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Outer Mongolia. At the end of 1918, the European War ended. In January 1919, the Paris Peace Conference was convened. China not only did not receive any reward for participating in the war but also suffered a great loss of rights. The conference decided that all German rights in Shandong would be entirely inherited by Japan, and Japan would maintain its special interests and special status in China.</p>
<p>Under the Anfu clique's regime, there was constant cession of power and humiliation of the country! There was constant harm to the country and the people!</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement was sparked by this situation of internal and external pressure. The students of Beijing first united! On May 4, 1919 (the eighth year of the Republic of China), more than 3,000 students in Beijing gathered to hold an unprecedented demonstration in Chinese history. They marched in formation, petitioning the Presidential Palace, demanding the arrest of the traitors Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, and Zhang Zongxiang. Unexpectedly, the government refused to accept their demands and forcibly dispersed the marching student队伍, resulting in the tragic and heroic drama of the national revolution of burning Cao and beating Zhang at Zhaojialou. Beijing students immediately established a student union, organized drama troupes, and inspection teams to check Japanese goods. All sectors of society responded unanimously, striking, boycotting work, and closing markets to support the anti-Japanese and boycott Japanese goods movement launched by the Beijing students. Subsequently, students, workers, farmers, businessmen, and students from all over the country and from all provinces established student unions to launch a large-scale anti-Japanese movement. Students from various places also elected representatives to Shanghai to establish a national student organization to lead the national anti-Japanese movement. At the same time, all sectors of society across the country organized petition groups, requesting the government to refuse to sign the peace treaty, demanding the abolition of the Twenty-One Demands that would destroy China, and demanding the punishment of pro-Japanese traitors. Students and business and industrial circles in Shanghai and other cities, in addition to strikes and boycotts, also demanded "open diplomacy," the realization of democratic politics, and freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association. Thus, the May Fourth Movement was vigorously launched from the patriotic movement of Beijing students.</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize that the May Fourth Movement was the first movement in the history of the Chinese revolution to clearly implement the united front's battle program. It started with the students' launch, followed by the enthusiastic response and joint action of students, cultural figures, workers, and businessmen from all over the country, and the revolutionary parties also supported this movement with their greatest strength. Only then could it achieve its due success, achieving the removal of the pro-Japanese faction Cao, Lu, and Zhang from their positions, the declaration of the invalidity of the Twenty-One Demands that humiliated the country, the refusal of our representatives attending the Paris Peace Conference to sign the treaty, and the victorious resolution of the Shandong issue at the Washington Conference later. Now our international environment has become even more favorable, the strength of the [enemy] is declining, and the connection between our government and the people has become closer, making it easier to achieve our demands. Today, we must accept the valuable lessons of the May Fourth Movement, strengthen internal unity, consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese united front with all ethnic parties, groups, and people, and support the brave soldiers and people who are fighting heroically on the front lines and in the rear. In particular, we must intensify our opposition to the "anti-communist peace" movement of the traitorous and collaborationist [elements] and strive for the most beautiful victory.</p>
<p>Third, we must recognize that the May Fourth Movement was essentially a democratic movement, and our current war of resistance and national reconstruction, as pointed out by the supreme leader in his recent speech at the Third National Political Council, is also a movement that demands the thorough realization of true democracy. Our current democratic movement demands independence and equality externally, and democracy and unity internally, and in the world, it has become the main force against fascist aggression and defending democracy and peace. Therefore, we must carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement in striving for democracy. We must expand the understanding of the people across the country regarding the great significance of democratic politics and the implementation of democracy during the war of resistance. We must know that the government and the people are now standing on the same front and striving together. If our politics become more democratic, the people will love the government more, the government's power will be greater, and the government's and the people's power to eliminate traitors and unite against foreign aggression will be strengthened. International conditions will also increase and expand. Only by implementing democracy and maximizing the power of the people can we guarantee victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must recognize that the May Fourth Movement was the enlightenment movement of China's new culture and the vanguard battle of the Chinese national revolution. It was not only the prelude to the Great Revolution of 1925-27, but also the pioneer of the current Chinese war of resistance and national reconstruction movement. We demand that the final success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction must inherit the glorious tradition of the May Fourth New Culture Movement and launch a cultural movement. We must establish a unified and broad organization for cultural work.</p>
<p>Combine the practice of national revolution, all the experiences and lessons learned during the war of resistance, and theory, and conduct specialized research on international issues, political issues, military issues, social issues, economic issues, and even ideological issues. At the same time, we should actively promote work on removing local education, promoting mass culture, supplying cultural food to the front lines, establishing cultural fortresses, clearing cultural traitors and feudal remnants, and fascist cultural offensives.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must further recognize that the May Fourth Movement was the glorious starting point of the Chinese student and youth movement. Since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese student and youth movement has not only built many glorious footprints of blood in every Chinese national revolutionary movement, but has also achieved a glorious and important position and played an exemplary and leading role in the global youth and student movement. Today, we must make it shine and expand, strengthen and expand the youth and student movement. We, the young students, should strive for: (1) Contribute all our strength to support the central government and unite in the war of resistance. Oppose the "anti-communist peace" movement of traitors and collaborators; (3) Under the leadership of the government, intensify military and political training, help the government's conscription movement, mobilize a large number of young people to go to the army, and mobilize a large number of young people to participate in wartime service. (3) In order to realize the above tasks, we must do our best to consolidate and expand the student youth national salvation organizations under the leadership of the government. (4) Strengthen cooperation with democratic countries and youth and student groups on a global scale, and expand the global anti-fascist and anti-aggression and aid-China and anti-Japanese movement. At the same time, we hope that the government and social leaders: (1) Explicitly guarantee the freedom of the youth and students' anti-Japanese and national salvation movement; (2) Enrich and expand the Three People's Principles Youth League, regardless of party or ethnic class, and absorb a large number of young people who are willing to fight for national liberation and implement the Three People's Principles. (3) Conscientiously implement the war of resistance and national reconstruction program and the recent Third National Education Conference to implement war of resistance education. (4) Rescue out-of-school children and young people, rescue unemployed and displaced young people, and reward overseas Chinese and friendly people who are enthusiastic about contributing to the development of cultural and educational undertakings. (5) Systematically cultivate a large number of young cadres and earnestly promote a large number of young people to participate in politics and the cause of war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>The tragic, fighting, revolutionary May, all the historical significance, fighting experiences and lessons, revolutionary theory, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles and Three Great Policies, Marx's scientific socialism and other great and rich works, all of this is necessary for us to promote the war of resistance and national reconstruction and develop the global anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle today. We must sincerely accept, deeply study, and cooperate with the actual battle to strive for a broader and more glorious victory.</p>
<h3>General Yu Hanmou of the Guangdong-North Front</h3>
<p>— (Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) Friends of China in China (10) - Ye Juesun</p>
<p>After crossing many mountain peaks on the Luofu Mountain ridge, the car's sickly body inevitably shook a little. Sitting in the car, we paid attention to the people's activities in the villages along the way, like browsing pictures on a silver screen! In the fields, on the mountainsides, and on the roads, there were working people, woodcutters, and people repairing the roads, soldiers. That kind of quiet, comforting, and industrious spirit expressed their profoundness and greatness. We arrived at General Yu Hanmou's headquarters around 2 p.m. on the 20th. The reporter had been here once before, so there were no difficulties in revisiting the old place. At the gate of the Deputy Commander's office, we met a Mr. Zhu, who was a student who had returned from England and spoke excellent English. At his invitation, we entered the living room to wait for Mr. Yu's arrival. The scene was the same as last time. On the walls next to us were two extremely detailed Guangdong military maps. In the corner of the wall on the left was a map of the water conservancy rivers in the Pearl River area, which was very clear and detailed. The annotations on it were all in Japanese. According to Chief of Staff Wang, "This was obtained from the [enemy] when Huizhou was recovered." In the past, our excessive politeness towards so-called "friendly nations" led to today's result of "traitors as numerous as hairs," to the extent that the [enemy]'s military maps were so detailed. After a while, Deputy Commander Yu came out. He was tall and stalwart, with a smile like a somewhat shy rural farmer. At first glance, he was a loyal and simple person. When speaking, he first expressed his deep sympathy for the Limonds' sympathy for China's war of resistance and their tireless efforts to run to the front lines of Guangdong. France is a country that loves freedom and independence, and China is now fighting for freedom and independence, so China and France can become good friends. Then, of course, the Limonds returned a word of thanks and a so-called "polite remark" of respect. When we talked about the military situation in Guangdong, Mr. Yu enthusiastically held a rattan whip and pointed to the floor to explain the situation when the [enemy] attacked Guangzhou, as well as the weakness of the internal military forces in Guangdong at that time. Then, he explained that the [enemy]'s gains in Guangdong were only the occupation of a few cities in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and that neither militarily nor economically did it have much impact on our long-term war of resistance strategy. Because of the loss of Guangzhou, but because we abandoned the passive defense of a station, we have now gained an active and flexible offensive. The [enemy] is controlled by us everywhere. Economically speaking, China is an agricultural country, and it has always been the countryside that supplies the cities and prospers the cities. Now we abandon the cities, on the one hand because we reduce the burden on the countryside and prosper the countryside, and on the other hand because we do not cooperate with the [enemy] and make the cities dead cities. ... According to our own estimates, the [enemy] will rarely get any more advantages in Guangdong's military development, one is the strengthening of internal military forces, the second is the expansion of mass mobilization, and the third is the extra dispersal of the [enemy]'s forces.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu knew that we had not had lunch yet, so the conversation was briefly ended. We sat together at the same table for lunch. This was a fairly standard Western meal, of course, it was still far from the food in the restaurants in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other cities. However, for the frontline commander's headquarters, this had to be said to be a rare luxurious scene. Guangdong is really a rich place, no matter which village or small town, even in wartime, white rice and roasted meat are still not a problem. Compared with many villages in Guizhou, Yunnan, and the Northwest, there is a real difference between heaven and earth. During lunch, General Yu Hanmou also talked a lot about his plans for the political work of the troops. He planned that there would be political instructors not only in the company but also in the platoon in the future. Political work is the driving force for maintaining and cultivating good military discipline, and it is also an element for strengthening combat effectiveness. The Limonds expressed great excitement about all of this. They said: "When I heard in Paris that Guangdong had fallen, everyone thought that the whole of Guangdong was over, because, I am not satisfied with what everyone says, the French people's common sense of geography is quite bad. What they know in their hearts is that China is only a very large place with many people, and with cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Peiping, Guangzhou... Even for myself. Only after arriving here did I know that Guangzhou is only a larger city compared to Guangdong, and its position in geography, economy, culture... is not so great, and that politics, military, economy, culture, etc. will change with the transfer of people. Therefore, I think that it is worth emphasizing in international publicity that the Japanese have only occupied points and lines in China, while the Chinese army still controls the surface. " As we ate and talked, Commander Yu's interest was also very strong. He said that the reporter's previous visit to Guangdong with Lu Yiren, Ren Chonggao, and others was the first time that Chinese reporters had entered Guangdong before [the enemy] took over. The Limonds were the first foreign reporters. We put down our knives and forks around 4 o'clock, and the dinner party was a complete success. We left the headquarters and took a car to the rural political department, which was more than ten miles away from here.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Continue in Northern Jiangxi and Southern Hubei; Nanchang Annihilation War Progressing Smoothly; Our Troops Fiercely Attack Xuzhou in Intense Melee Combat</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Chongqing on the 20th] According to reports, Nanchang can be captured any day now; the morale of the enemy in Hubei and Hunan is extremely low, and they no longer have the ability to fight. The enemy in southern China has also increased, launching a large-scale offensive.</p>
<p>Jiangxi-Hubei Front</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 28th] According to Chinese reports, Chinese troops in Nanchang are currently mopping up the remaining Japanese troops in the city. Chinese guerrillas have cut off the retreating Japanese troops and are annihilating them. Officials of the Nanchang puppet government are attempting to escape, but have been captured by Chinese plainclothes soldiers and executed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 28th, 11:00 AM] Our troops recaptured Shengmiwei last night, seizing a light machine gun and dozens of rifles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shucheng, 28th] Our advance troops attacking Nanchang rushed into the city on the afternoon of the 27th, reaching the eastern section of Zhongshan Road, and engaged in fierce street fighting with the enemy. As of dusk, they were still in a stalemate. At the same time, our follow-up troops attacking Nanchang have also reached the outskirts of the city, responding from both inside and outside, and the enemy in the city is surrounded and will not be difficult to annihilate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 28th] There are still a few remnants of the enemy entrenched on the road between Nanchang and Liantang. Our troops are currently sweeping them up. Communication between Nanchang and Liantang has been cut off by us.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Yicheng, 28th] Some of the enemy troops in Zhongxiang Sanyangdian and Jingshan Pingchang withdrew today. Our troops attacked the enemy from Qianmu Dongbo River on the 26th and were very successful, approaching Yingcheng.</p>
<p>Su-Yu Front</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 28th] Shen Honglie's army of 50,000 men is currently fiercely attacking Xuzhou, attempting to capture the city. The Chinese reinforcements to the Xuzhou area have cut off the Japanese army's lines of communication, causing great difficulties in the Japanese army's supplies. Intense melee combat broke out between the Chinese and Japanese armies on the outskirts of Xuzhou. Japanese army units were reportedly wiped out.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 28th] On the 27th, a certain regiment of ours again attacked the west gate and station of Kaifeng, killing dozens of enemy soldiers. In recent days, small teams of our troops have attacked Kaifeng every night, causing great panic among the enemy and especially shaking the puppet regime. Currently, Biancheng is only open for two hours each day. The barbed wire along the city wall is electrified from 9:00 PM every night until the following morning, and cars carrying three or four hundred enemy soldiers constantly patrol.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoma Store, 28th] A certain Deng unit of ours in eastern Henan fiercely attacked the enemy at Huicheng Temple (north of Changyingji) the day before yesterday, fighting fiercely for five hours, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers, capturing four mountain guns, twelve horses, and destroying three vehicles. Over seven hundred enemy troops from Kaifeng rushed to reinforce. We launched a head-on attack, killing many enemy soldiers. By yesterday morning, our troops had completely destroyed all the enemy guns and calmly retreated to a certain location.</p>
<p>Jin-Sui Front</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuci, 28th] In the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, the enemy has repeatedly reinforced and repeatedly committed offenses. The loss in the Jinan Triangle area is extremely serious, unprecedented in the past two months. It is rumored that enemy commanders Ushijima and Hirayama have been reprimanded and are planning another large-scale offensive. There is constant contact on both sides of Linfen. Most of the enemy in Linfen has been transferred south, and there are now only over two thousand troops. The enemy in Fushan and Anze has increased. More than five hundred enemy troops in Fushan, under the cover of artillery fire, launched an offensive towards Zhujiahuan (Chennan, Fushan) on the morning of the 24th. Our troops blocked them on a certain high ground and routed the enemy after a long period of mixed fighting. There are now over two thousand enemy troops in Fushan, mostly near the east of the city, confronting us. Enemy commander Yonekawa Akiyama was killed by us in a mixed battle near Nvze a few days ago. There are currently seven or eight hundred enemy infantry and cavalry in Heilongguan. They have been annihilated by us by over four hundred in recent days, and are now firmly defending their strongholds and dare not attack. The fighting in the area north of Linfen and south of Shishi has become quiet. The enemy is attempting to repair the road, but dares not start work because they are being monitored by us. The enemy in Fenxi has repeatedly increased in order to coordinate with the fighting on the Heilongguan front. Over a thousand enemy troops divided into two groups on the 15th and launched an offensive south into Heping, engaging in fierce fighting with us in the Majiang Liujia Gou area for several hours. Because the enemy was numerous and we were few, Heping was invaded by the enemy. Blocking is underway in the Guancun area. The fighting in southern Shanxi is still fierce. The enemy's main force has been repeatedly routed, and they are very panicked. Two thousand enemy infantry and cavalry, along with six artillery pieces, from Anji, Yuncheng, Wanquan, and Yishi launched an offensive towards Wangjiazhuang (southwest of Jishan) on the 24th, dividing into four routes. The enemy's artillery fire was fierce and often intense. They fought fiercely for six hours, intending to fight a decisive battle with us. Knowing the enemy's plan, we snuck up to the various mountain tops and engaged the enemy in mobile warfare. A certain unit of ours engaged in fierce fighting with over a thousand enemy troops in Wangtong Village (northwest of Yuncheng) day and night on the 20th, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. The enemy in Wanquan has been continuously reinforcing. Our various units have established close contact and are launching offensives against the enemy. A large part of the newly surrendered Roman enemy has been reinforcing Lukou. A certain unit of ours is intercepting them in separate groups. There have only been minor contacts in Wenxi, Hejin, and Jishan, with no major changes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuci, 27th] Since the start of our attacks, our troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains and the eastern side of the Tongpu Road have fought hard for ten days, attacking Fushan, Yicheng, Jiangxian, Wenxi, Xiaxian, Zhangdian, as well as Anji, Yuncheng, Jiexian south side, Congshan, Zhangcun, Ershiling and other strongholds, achieving significant battle results, especially in Fushan, Yicheng, and the areas south and north of Yanzhang in southeastern Wenxi. Our regiment commander Peng Zhenpu died in battle on the north side of Fushan. Regiment commander Qu Zhenhua was wounded near Shicun in Yicheng. The bravery of our officers and soldiers in annihilating the enemy is evident here. According to enemy casualties statistics, there are more than seven thousand in Anji, Houma, Lin--, Yuci many wounded soldiers. On the 20th, more than a thousand enemy corpses were transported successively from the north of Wen Wan. Currently, 5,000 to 6,000 enemy reinforcements from Linfen and 4,000 to 5,000 enemy reinforcements from Fushan Quwo have been sent to Yicheng Wenxi, and are currently in fierce battle with us. The enemy in Anji Yuncheng is stubbornly resisting, entrenched in strongholds. We are using strong forces to attack the north side of the railway. The enemy that launched an offensive south along the northern section of the Baijin Highway in early-ten days totaled more than 8,000. After successively ambushing them at Fenshiling Jiadian north of Qin County and the east side of Gucheng Shipan and other places, we inflicted casualties of one-quarter (i.e. more than 2,000). The defeated enemy retreated through Nanguan and continued to flee east of Zihongkou. On the night of the 21st, our army attacked the town, broke through two layers of barbed wire, captured two bunkers, and killed more than fifty enemy soldiers. By this point, all the enemy that had invaded southern Shanxi in separate routes had been completely defeated. In recent ten days, the enemy reinforcing from Linfen has had more than one division. In the Jiang area, there are also four or five thousand men from the puppet Sixth Division Jiang Zhengpu. The enemy in Yongji Fenglingdu appears to be withdrawing north, and the Zhengtai Road enemy is currently stopping passenger transport. It is rumored that a large number of enemy and puppet troops will be transferred from the northeast to reinforce Shanxi. A major battle in southern Shanxi is brewing. Statistics show that in the past two weeks, the enemy casualties in southern Shanxi were seven thousand, and in eastern Shanxi two thousand, together with the enemy annihilated by our army along the Xi-Li Highway, Heilongguan, Jie Jie, Lengxi, Hong, Zhao, Huo and other places in western Shanxi, should be around ten thousand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 16th] On the evening of the 24th, our troops in eastern Sui led a surprise attack from the border area between Tonghao Town and Liangcheng, harassing the enemy. They encountered more than two hundred puppet Mongolian troops near Dahaitan. Because the enemy's momentum was rampant, we used a large force to outflank the enemy's rear. The enemy panicked and fled. We took the initiative to attack, driving the enemy into Dahaitan and occupying the high ground, and fiercely attacked the enemy in the water. The enemy suffered more than half drowned and wounded. More than ten vehicles and several aircraft were reinforced by the card town, and bombed us. Our troops retreated safely.</p>

<h3>Outline of Propaganda in Guerrilla Areas (4) - Prepared and Issued by the Political Department of the Military Commission</h3>
<p>Third, since the war of resistance entered the second phase, the power of the enemy's excellent weapons has been greatly reduced, and their willingness to venture deep has been hesitant. Therefore, it is not easy to achieve superficial victories militarily. The exaggerated and deceptive propaganda of the past has suddenly lost its effectiveness. Therefore, in the second phase of the war of resistance, external wars of aggression have lost their role in alleviating internal conflicts and have instead become a cause of promoting internal conflicts. The collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and the internal contradictions of the Hiranuma Cabinet are clear examples. This provides us with great convenience for conducting propaganda against the enemy.</p>
<p>(三) Our war of resistance against the enemy is different from the enemy's militarism. We are fighting for national survival, national independence, and for world peace and justice. Therefore, we should also be honest and upright in our propaganda. Not only should we not use deception in our internal propaganda, but we should also not need deceptive means in our propaganda against the enemy. We only need to state the truth and cite the facts, which will be enough to shatter the enemy's deceitful propaganda and be powerful propaganda that gains the trust of enemy and puppet officers and soldiers. Therefore, (Zi) we must clearly tell enemy personnel and soldiers what enormous damage the Japanese aggression war is doing to them and their country. What we can offer them and their families is only hunger and death. We must tell them that Japan's international status is gradually declining, and that the benefits of aggression are only for a few chaebols and their lackeys. We must tell them about the distinction between enemy and friend. The Japanese soldiers' enemy is not China, but the military officers who are leading the invasion. China, in sympathizing with the Japanese soldiers' anti-war stance, is their absolute friend. At the same time, tell them that there are domestic and foreign people who love justice and democratic countries that are willing to maintain peace who also support their anti-war struggle, especially China. Therefore, their only way out is to transform the war of aggression against China into a war to overthrow domestic warlords. (Chou) We must tell soldiers from Korea and Taiwan that the result of their risking their lives for the Japanese minority warlords and chaebols is only to increase their own suffering and to aggravate the Japanese capitalists' oppression and exploitation of them. They can only seize the opportunity to turn the weapons in their hands around and strike at their real enemies--the Japanese minority warlords and chaebols--in order to gain national and personal liberation and freedom. (Yin) We must tell all puppet troops that they should not be threatened or deceived by Japanese bandits and traitors into fighting their own brothers and being cannon fodder for the enemy. We must tell them that while they are forced to fight for the enemy, their families are being oppressed and monitored by the enemy, are suffering from hunger, and are being forced to work for the enemy. They must turn their guns around, kill the enemy and puppet troops, and come over to our side to fight against the enemy and recover their homeland. (Mao) In order to increase the power of our political offensives and the effectiveness of our propaganda against the enemy, we must treat prisoners of war well. The Supreme Leader has instructed in the points that should be given special attention in the war of resistance, "Strive to capture prisoners of war alive and give special treatment to prisoners, and do not kill prisoners." The purpose of treating prisoners well is not only because it is humane and complies with international law, but also because it is convenient for combat and political propaganda. We should treat them well and strive for them to help us and to continue to increase the effectiveness of our propaganda against the enemy and to disintegrate and sway the enemy forces, because this treatment is sufficient to show (1) our benevolence in striking the enemy politically and (2) to expose the enemy's deceitful propaganda that China kills prisoners of war and to eliminate the enemy soldiers' fear, which can reduce their stubborn resistance and avoid unnecessary sacrifices. (Chen) Our method of treating prisoners of war should be: first, respect their personality and do not hurt their feelings, and treat them as our friends to strive for them to become comrades-in-arms in the fight to overthrow Japanese capitalists; second, make them feel at ease, and the wounded must be treated first before questioning; third, when questioning, (1) do not threaten them, (2) do not ridicule them, (3) be patient and do not expect immediate results, (4) keep their secrets and do not let reporters take pictures and interview them casually, (5) and send them to the rear as quickly as possible; fourth, after sending them to the camp, we must actively educate them to influence them.</p>
<p>Discipline and Cultivation of Propaganda Personnel</p>
<p>Personnel doing propaganda work in the battlefield are in a more difficult environment and bear a greater responsibility. Therefore, they need more perseverance and resolution. After the start of the Second War of Resistance, the Supreme Leader and the Minister have given many speeches to political workers, giving sincere and clear instructions on the discipline and spirit that political workers should abide by.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding discipline, the Supreme Leader said at the Political Work Conference, "Political workers must behave correctly in life and action to influence officers and soldiers, not only to make them not doubt, but also to make them believe, then everything will be accomplished." The Minister also gave specific instructions. In addition to the original regulations on political work discipline, the following principles are formulated: "The discipline of the troops shall be determined by the people's support, and the success or failure of political work shall be determined by the discipline of the troops." Personnel engaged in battlefield propaganda work must strictly abide by and personally practice these principles in order to correct the people's contempt for propaganda work.</p>
<p>(2) Whether propaganda work can be carried out depends on the actions of the personnel. Therefore, propaganda personnel must work hard to study in order to gain the trust of those who are being propagandized. (1) First, they must lead by example. The Supreme Leader instructed us that the attitude and conduct of political workers must be fair and their lives must be frugal. As the saying goes, "teaching by example is better than teaching by words." The speed and extent of influence are also greater. The Minister instructed us, "All political workers must also use their lives as propaganda, with the standard of making life in the front line equal to the life of the soldiers and the life in the rear equal to the life of the people. Propaganda should be based on personal practice, not on empty talk." (2) Second, they should have the spirit of service of communications soldiers and cooks. The Minister said, "Political workers should have the spirit of communications soldiers. Getting up early and going to bed late are very important. If the work creed can achieve these two points, then they will be respected and set an example for others." It is especially necessary to have the spirit of communications soldiers in doing propaganda work in the battlefield, especially propaganda work against the enemy (arriving before the troops and leaving after the troops). (3) Third, they must study at all times, learn at all times, and reflect at all times, because our war of resistance is unprecedented at home and abroad. Therefore, we must study at all times and in all places, and sincerely study, carefully learn, and humbly reflect in order to accept the precious experience of blood and create new and victorious ways of working.</p>
<p>(Note) The "Current Situation After the Start of the Second War of Resistance" has already been seen in the Second War of Resistance Propaganda Outline previously issued by this department, so it is not recorded again. (End)</p>
<h3>Unified US Support for Sanctions Against Japanese Aggressors: Pittman Introduces New Bill to Congress, Authorizing Presidential Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently submitted a bill to Congress authorizing the President to impose trade sanctions between the United States and "nations that violate the Nine-Power Treaty." The "nations that violate the Nine-Power Treaty" as referred to in the bill, refer to Japan. In essence, the bill authorizes the President to issue an order to prohibit trade with Japan. Pittman is the original proposer of this new Neutrality Act. According to the provisions of the bill proposed by Pittman, the President may issue an order to implement the various provisions of the bill and submit it to Congress. The order will take effect ten days later, and Congress has no right to veto it. Pittman told reporters, "The purpose of the bill I proposed is to grant the government the necessary power. As a result of Japan's invasion of China over the years, the lives of American nationals in China are constantly threatened, and their legitimate interests are also subject to unwarranted restrictions. All of this violates the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. The government has indeed protested to Japan repeatedly, but to no avail. The bill I have proposed may make it easier for the President to reach an 'understanding' with Japan."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Congressman Guyer stated yesterday at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Congress should enact a bill authorizing the President to lift the arms embargo on countries that have been invaded. If we continue to supply arms to countries that violate treaties, it would be tantamount to assisting the wicked and strengthening the power of our future enemies. Dr. Charles, President of the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship Through Churches, stated that President Roosevelt should appeal to the signatory nations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, emphasizing that if war breaks out, the United States cannot remain completely aloof. Efforts should be made to eradicate the scourge of war from the world. Secretary of State Stimson, back in 1931, originally intended to expose Japan's bluffing attitude. If his efforts had succeeded, Japan would not have dared to launch a war against China. Professor Martfield of Fleming University advocated that the government should recall its ambassador to Japan, increase the amount of loans to China, and abolish the Neutrality Act, so that the aggressor country would not benefit from it. According to further news, Congressman Guyer advocated that Congress should pass a bill as soon as possible, stipulating different treatment for aggressor and victim nations. He stated that the bill could immediately affect the situation in the Far East. Japan's brazen violation of the Nine-Power Treaty should be sanctioned. The United States would not be in danger of provoking a war, because Japan is concentrating all its efforts on dealing with China and has no time to worry about other matters.</p>
<h3>Grew to Complete Term, Returning to the US at the End of June</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Shanghai report: Admiral Grew, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, will complete his term and return to the US at the end of June. A farewell ceremony will be held on May 19th. His successor is Rear Admiral Hart, head of the US Navy's Bureau of Ships, who is scheduled to depart from the US on June 30th and arrive in Shanghai around July 18th to take over the post.</p>
<h3>Japan Uneasy Over Unfavorable International Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] After the news that Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had proposed a bill authorizing the President to restrict US-Japan trade reached Japan, the Japanese side expressed obvious anxiety. According to a Tokyo dispatch, a spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stubbornly tried to downplay the matter, saying that the external reports were probably inaccurate and that it was not appropriate to comment hastily. If it is officially confirmed, then a comment will be issued.</p>
<h3>China Orders High-Speed Military Aircraft from the US, Totaling 158 Planes, Worth 15 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] According to unofficial but reliable sources, the Chinese government has signed an aircraft purchase contract with the United Aircraft Corporation of America, valued at 15 million US dollars. The contract stipulates that, regardless of how busy European orders are, the manufacturer must give priority to delivering 79 light bombers and fighters to China within four months. The remaining deliveries will consist of 52 Seversky pursuit planes and 27 Johns-Volt light bomber planes. The former are the fastest in Asia. The total number of aircraft ordered is 158. This matter was handled by personnel from China here, who are currently in the process of purchasing radio equipment for 52 aircraft, estimated to be worth 300,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in Europe, Japanese Political Circles in Disarray, Internal Opinions Highly Divided, Foreign Policy Still Difficult to Decide</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tokyo report: According to newspapers of the Asahi Shimbun group, when government officials discussed how to determine policy in the new situation in Europe, all responsible parties took an extremely cautious attitude. Not only did the five ministers hold meetings every day to exchange views on this matter, but the relevant bureaus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Overseas Affairs also held joint meetings from time to time. However, even if there are no obstacles in the government's discussions, it is generally believed that no decision will be made before May. It is reported that internal opinions in Japan regarding the military alliance between Germany, Japan, and Italy are highly divided. The report in the Asahi Shimbun is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Japan's Industries Declining, Unemployment Soaring</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 28th Dispatch] As of the end of last year, there were 115,192 unemployed people in Japan, including 26,360 small business merchants. It is expected that another 199,553 people will soon become unemployed, bringing the total number of unemployed to 314,745. The Tokyo area has the largest number of unemployed people, accounting for about half of the total number of unemployed people in the country, with 159,000 people. The textile industry has the most unemployed people, accounting for about 39 percent of the total number of unemployed people in various industries. Next are the steel industry, the leather industry, the rubber industry, the paper industry, the construction industry, and the vehicle and transportation industries. These industries have all been affected by the government's economic mobilization plan. The silk weaving and pottery industries have suffered adverse effects due to reduced exports. Taverns, restaurants, and jewelry stores are sluggish due to declining demand. Officials claim that 62 percent of the unemployed are men, but unemployed women in the textile industry account for 6.3 percent of the total number of unemployed.</p>
<h3>Coal Mine Explosion in Fukuoka, Kyushu</h3>

<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 28th Special Dispatch] The central government believes that Chongqing has the conditions to be a special municipality and has decided to reclassify the municipal government under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan in the short term, and establish a municipal council. The central government has finalized the list of all senators from the temporary Sichuan Provincial Council. In order to strengthen the power of the Sichuan public opinion organs, Kong Xiangxi has decided to request the National Government to add 20 senators, bringing the total to 70 senators and 35 alternate senators, the largest number of any province in the country.</p>
<h3>Taishan Close to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>[Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, Taishan Correspondent] Having crossed a stretch of water that most people deem treacherous, I arrived in Taishan in the dim light of dawn.</p>
<p>Although Taishan is close to the front lines, everything is still peaceful as usual. The reporter recalled that when I was in Hong Kong, newspapers had reported that Taishan City had been severely bombed, but after arriving in Taishan, I learned that it was all fabricated.</p>
<p>According to the various county government officials who spoke to the reporter, Chonglou and Doushan had not been bombed, but Baisha and Gongyi had indeed been bombed, and the disaster was quite serious, with about two to three hundred casualties. According to a certain official here, "Guanghai has our iron bastion, and if the enemy dares to try it, they will surely be smashed to smithereens." According to reliable information obtained here, there may be enemy ships cruising far off the coast of Guanghai, but they have never dared to approach Guanghai.</p>
<p>The situation in the various towns in Taishan is also very calm. Merchants are doing business as usual, schools are still holding classes, and farmers are still actively planting. However, after Gongyi was bombed, the atmosphere was slightly desolate.</p>
<p>Mobilization Work</p>
<p>After the Jianghui battles occurred, it was like a sudden thunderclap on a sunny day, and the people of Taishan were inevitably a little flustered. However, the government was very calm and dealt with the Liu battles with ease. Currently, the "Anti-Enemy Vanguard" is working with the "Mobilization Committee" to launch an "Emergency Propaganda Week for Armed Defense of Greater Taishan," mobilizing all intellectuals, young students, and assigning them to go deep into the countryside to carry out propaganda, injecting many stimulants and invigorating agents into the quiet and tense villages. The people have gone from being flustered to being invigorated and calm. Currently, the "Anti-Enemy Vanguard" has become a large organization for mobilizing the people of Taishan, with membership expanding to more than 1,300 people, and its work has spread to every village. In terms of mobilizing the masses, Taishan has also carried out expanded publicity for the "National Spiritual Mobilization," with teachers and students from the county's various secondary schools organizing propaganda teams, divided into 40 teams, with 10 people in each team, with the principals of each school serving as team leaders and the teachers serving as team leaders, going deep into the people to conduct widespread propaganda. In addition, the organization of village defense teams is currently being stepped up, concentrating military forces, with the regimental police command acting as the commander. The self-defense forces are now extremely strong. If the enemy dares to try, it will be tantamount to digging their own graves.</p>
<p>Administrative Facilities</p>
<p>In coordination with this tense situation, all administrative facilities have had to choose to adapt to the urgent needs and accelerate their implementation. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Continuing the implementation of Baojia: Taishan's Baojia movement is being promoted extremely enthusiastically. The training of village chiefs in each township has now begun, with the first batch of 300 people. At the same time, the "Five-Household Joint Guarantee Pledge" is being implemented, so that every five households mutually guarantee that they will not collude with or assist the enemy. To prevent officials from colluding with the enemy, a joint guarantee method will also be implemented for civil servants.</p>
<p>2. Strictly clearing out opium and gambling: The habits of opium smoking and gambling are quite prevalent in the villages of Taishan, which poses a considerable obstacle to the war effort. It is heard that County Magistrate Huang is currently implementing a cleanup operation. The cleanup methods are roughly as follows: (1) Opium and gambling offenders are sent to the relief home to undergo rehabilitation work. (2) After rehabilitation, with the consent of the offender, they are sent to the front lines to serve the country. (3) Confiscation measures are taken against those who disrupt order.</p>
<p>At the same time, preparations for wartime are being actively promoted, such as the development of Dalongdong, etc., which has already started construction. First, a sunflower canopy that can accommodate tens of thousands of people is erected, in preparation for refugees to flee there when war breaks out. The second phase of erecting sunflower canopies is also being stepped up. Other wartime work, such as township volunteer police, rescue teams, transportation teams, comfort teams, work teams... etc., are also being stepped up and expanded.</p>
<p>Destroying Transportation</p>
<p>Destroying transportation is one of the wartime preparation efforts. Recently, the highways in Taishan have been thoroughly destroyed, and the Xinning Railway has also reportedly been thoroughly destroyed. According to Chiang Kai-shek's orders, the destruction was carried out by each district and township being responsible for a section. The people enthusiastically participated. Now, from Doushan to Gongyi, from Taicheng to Baisha, there is not a single steel rail or sleeper left. These have been paid to the people as compensation. The destruction is as follows: countless holes have been dug along the way, each hole being about five zhang long, two zhang wide, and two zhang deep. Recently, only the highway near the city still has a short section passable by car, in order to adapt to the needs of transportation.</p>
<p>Rice Shortage and Relief</p>
<p>Taishan, which is close to the front lines, is now experiencing a widespread "rice shortage." Because Taishan's rice production can only last for three months, it has always relied on imported rice for supply. Since the fall of Jiangdou, transportation has been difficult and rice prices have soared. Top-quality rice costs about 25 yuan per dan, medium-quality rice costs 23 or 24 yuan per dan, and even the coarsest rice costs 21 yuan per dan. Even the rice stores in Taicheng have experienced a situation where there is no rice to sell, with only one or two stores having three or four dan left, restricting each person to only four or five qian.</p>
<p>Because of this, the county government has transferred 120,000 yuan from the Arms and Food Regulation Committee, which was intended to purchase firearms, and brought back imported rice from Hong Kong. Currently, the third batch of more than 2,000 bags of rice has been transported to Taishan. This batch of imported rice is first distributed to the districts and townships with the most severe rice shortages, providing rice to the people at a fair price, with a price of 13 yuan per dan in national currency. Preparations are being made to continue to transport four or five batches back and distribute them to other districts and townships. In addition, the county government has issued licenses to various shops to handle rice on their own, exempting them from rice taxes. Under the severe situation, rescuing the rice shortage is also one of the wartime scenes in Taishan. In addition to rice, the medical problem is also a serious phenomenon in Taishan. Now, the wounded soldiers from the Jianghui battle are being transported back to Taishan, and the number of people seeking medical treatment continues to increase. The medicines stored in the pharmacies in Taicheng have all been used up. Therefore, the medical problem is currently a problem that needs to be solved urgently in Taishan. Otherwise, the rapid return of wounded soldiers will be a very problematic situation.</p>
<p>When the reporter met with various agencies, organizations, and officials in Taishan, they all earnestly asked me to appeal to the overseas Chinese from the Siyi area and the compatriots across the country, "Save Taishan's rice and medicine."</p>

<h3>Hitler Delivers Speech, Abrogating Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Rejecting US Peace Proposals, Declaring Wartime Measures</h3>
<p>Hitler</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th] The German leader Hitler delivered a speech in the German Parliament this afternoon. The full text is as follows: "You are all familiar with the absurd telegram that the President of the United States sent to me. Before I had even received the document, its contents had already been published on radio and in newspapers all over the world. The organs and newspapers of the democratic countries have all unanimously praised the telegram as an extraordinarily brilliant and exquisite document. This fact compels the country based on the people (referring to Italy and Germany) to immediately adopt the wartime measures that are practiced in oligarchic countries (referring to democratic countries).</p>
<p>Denouncing the Peace Treaty</p>
<p>Ever since I first stepped onto the political stage, I have held the sole belief of recovering Germany's freedom. I have repeatedly worked to restore the rights that were violently taken away in war by others. To this day, all the land included in the Greater Germanic Reich belongs to the original Reich of that time. The Reich existed long before the Americas were discovered by humans, with a vast territory, far surpassing that of today, including countless districts and provinces, which were unfortunately lost. Countless people have dedicated themselves and struggled to the death for the country, driven by peace and justice. However, millions of people have ultimately been deceived by this peace. Even those who do not understand the Germans and fought alongside us have tasted the pain of this treaty. Even the victorious countries have suffered no small amount of harm. Hatred, falsehood, and unreasonableness are all products of the Treaty of Versailles. The right to self-determination of nearly 11.5 million people has been wantonly deprived, not by victorious soldiers, but by politicians. They presumptuously abolished the old social system and created a new one, without regard to bloodline, ancestry, reason, or the economic environment of life.</p>
<p>The result is almost complete. The leaders of the so-called democratic countries arrogantly assumed the responsibility of resolving the various problems of the social life of the people at that time with the qualifications of dictators of a new world order. But when this new world order turned into a catastrophe, the democratic peace dictators of Europe and the United States were all afraid and dared not take on the past responsibility again, slandering each other and trying to justify themselves with past history. The suffering we have endured is indescribable. Colonies were seized, financial resources were looted, and deliberate looting was carried out in the form of so-called reparations, causing the unfortunate national destiny of our country to fall into the darkest period. We now know the reason for the painful results of this great war very clearly. There is no other reason than deliberate destruction. In order to achieve this goal, first, the enemy countries must be disintegrated. Therefore, Germany's colonies must be removed. Second, these unfortunate countries, which are abused by democratic countries, must never be allowed to recover. Germany must pay reparations for sixty years, seventy years, or even a hundred years, without end. Moreover, the most shameful act of oppression in the world was the decision in the Treaty of Versailles to divide Germany's territory and undermine Germany's political integrity. Gentlemen, I have never doubted from the beginning that there will never be peace in the world under the treaty. Even if the treaty is revised, it will not achieve good results. Therefore, when I came to power, I decided my route. (The middle part describes Germany's achievements in recent years, briefly) Today, the atmosphere is indeed trending towards tension, and Germany does not have to bear the blame for it. This is actually created by international elements constantly planning to maintain the interests of their capitalists. I have issued statements to a number of countries, expressing my appreciation for their strict adherence to neutrality. These countries include the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Denmark. Italy is our friend. Hungary and Yugoslavia are both its neighbors. We are fortunate and do not need to make a statement to them. (The middle part describes the process of merging Austria and merging Czechoslovakia, briefly) The Czech question was actually decided long ago in the Munich Four-Power Agreement. At that time, it was stipulated that if the Czech parties could not reach a compromise, they could submit a request to the Four Powers for reconsideration. But as a result, the parties only wanted to submit an appeal to Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Anglo-German Relations</p>
<p>My agreement with Chamberlain had nothing to do with the Czech affair. The agreement was entirely about various issues between the United Kingdom and Germany. My future actions will still be based on the Munich negotiation method, but Chamberlain believes that the Munich Agreement has been abandoned by us, and we are willing to answer it with this. Since I came to power, I have warmly desired that the United Kingdom and Germany can maintain friendship forever. I have always believed that the existence of the British Empire has unparalleled value for human culture and economy. However, if the United Kingdom does not recognize Germany's interests, I believe that it is impossible for the United Kingdom and Germany to maintain permanent friendship. Only mutual assistance between the United Kingdom and Germany can maintain permanent friendship. I once heard Chamberlain say that he no longer believes in Germany's guarantee, implying that the German people should not hope that the United Kingdom trusts Germany. However, since the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, it has strived to maintain friendship with the United Kingdom. I have voluntarily reduced the navy, the purpose of which is to avoid a war between the United Kingdom and Germany. However, the United Kingdom's statement is that it has become an enemy of Germany and has formally announced the encirclement of Germany. Then the Anglo-German Naval Agreement should naturally be abolished. I am now notifying the British government of this. I still do not want to compete with the United Kingdom in expanding armaments, but only adopt self-defense measures. If the United Kingdom is willing to reopen negotiations, I would still welcome it and hope that both sides can reach an understanding. (The middle part describes the economic discussions between Germany and various small countries, briefly)</p>
<p>Attitude towards Poland</p>
<p>At present, the only German-Polish Danzig question must be resolved sooner or later. A few days ago, several talks were held here. I made several points to Poland: (1) Danzig returns to Germany and remains a free city. (2) Germany builds a highway and a railway through the Polish Corridor, each managed by Germany. The exchange conditions are: (1) Recognition of Poland's economic column in Danzig. (2) A free port is designated for Poland in Danzig. (3) Recognition of the current German-Polish border as permanent. (4) Signing a 25-year non-aggression pact with Poland. The validity period of this agreement far exceeds my personal life. (5) Germany, Poland, and Hungary jointly guarantee Slovakia. However, Poland has rejected my proposal. Poland has indicated that it is only willing to do the following two things: (1) Conduct negotiations to replace the commissioner sent by the League of Nations in Danzig. (2) Discuss facilitating the transportation of goods in the Polish Corridor. I deeply regret Poland's attitude, but fortunately this has not reached a dead end. Unfortunately, Poland today is similar to the Czech Republic a year ago. Due to international pressure, it has mobilized its troops, while Germany has not deployed a single soldier to resist Poland. Poland's attack on Germany is entirely due to international pressure. They have added the so-called guarantee to the Polish government, expressing military cooperation with Poland to resist the enemy. Poland's attitude in participating in this action violates the agreement I made with General Pilsudski when I was elected. Therefore, I have notified the Polish government that the treaty is no longer in effect. I would like to reiterate this point, that my decision does not change my attitude. If Poland is still willing to renew negotiations with Germany and conclude an old friendship, I sincerely welcome it and am willing to discuss it together on the basis of equality and clarity. The chaos in the European situation is entirely due to the intentional stirring up of international war instigators, causing Europe to fall into suffering. The scheme to plunge European culture into the disaster of Bolshevism failed in Spain due to the aid of Germany and Italy's heroism. At present, all parties are intent on creating the belief that the United Kingdom will lead the encirclement of us and reap the benefits. We are still committed to close cooperation with Italy and Japan to cope with the future.</p>
<p>Reply to the US President</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 28th] Hitler's reply to US President Roosevelt's telegram calling for peace is as follows: (1) The reason for the fear of war, as President Roosevelt said, is purely due to the instigation of irresponsible newspapers and the circulation of pamphlets, which slander foreign leaders. (2) President Roosevelt is concerned that every war will inevitably have disastrous consequences for the world, but if the world does not enter into disputes due to chaotic treaties and obligations, I cannot agree with President Roosevelt's statement. (3) I sympathize with President Roosevelt's appeal for resolving disputes by peaceful means, but this is made even more difficult by the efforts of politicians, political figures, and journalists who are directly unrelated or even have no connection to the matter. (4) Although I see inaccurate news about Germany's threat in the newspapers of democratic countries every day, I do not know that Germany poses any threat to other countries, as President Roosevelt stated. (5) For twenty years, I have explained and agreed with President Roosevelt's view that once a war breaks out, the winner, the loser, and the neutral party will all suffer adverse effects. (6) President Roosevelt believes that the leaders of great countries should maintain peace and avoid disasters for the people, but if these leaders cannot control the newspapers that instigate war, they should ignore and suppress them. President Roosevelt said that there are currently attempts to invade other independent countries, which are unfounded and are a resistance to international calm and will eventually disrupt world peace. I ask President Roosevelt to name the countries that have been threatened. I have previously led wars, and I do not know what I want to do to cause a war in the future. President Roosevelt has said that the current situation in the world will eventually lead to great disasters. How should this be explained? I have doubts about President Roosevelt's statement that all international disputes can be resolved at the conference table. The League of Nations conference was the greatest conference, but the United States was the first country to withdraw from the League of Nations. I have asked various independent small countries and provided conditional or absolute reciprocal guarantees. I have just read the speech of de Valera of the Irish Free State. de Valera did not mention Germany's oppression of Ireland, but criticized the United Kingdom's coercion of Ireland. The United Kingdom currently occupies Palestine, depriving it of its independence and implementing tyrannical methods. The Arabs continue to appeal to the world and lament the United Kingdom's barbaric methods. Some have said that I have the intention of attacking South American territory, which is unfounded. I only ordered the expansion of the army after the suggestion of a maximum troop level of 300,000 in 1934. As for the suggestion of holding a world economic conference, I believe that what is important is not theoretical discussion, but actually removing obstacles. I believe that President Roosevelt's fulfillment of the promises of the late President Wilson (referring to the Fourteen Points) would be a valuable action."</p>
<h3>America Demands Germany's Written Response, Refrains from Commenting on Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] According to senior government officials here, President Roosevelt has decided to reject considering Hitler's speech as a response to his proposal. The government's stance is that since the President's proposal was submitted in writing, Hitler should also respond in writing, as is customary in diplomacy. Therefore, the US government will not criticize Hitler's speech.</p>
<h3>Poland Mobilizes, Numbers Reach One Million, Safeguarding Interests in Danzig, Germany Makes Demands to Lithuania</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 28th] Poland's official newspaper stated that the number of armed personnel in Poland has now reached one million, with 400,000 regular troops and 600,000 reservists. This is the first time Poland has announced the number of mobilized troops.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, 27th] Polish newspapers today published reports with explicit authorization, listing the conditions for changing the status quo of Danzig as follows: (1) Danzig should not be incorporated into the German political sphere of influence; (2) Danzig's customs duties should remain under Polish jurisdiction; (3) Poland's interests and rights in Danzig must be safeguarded.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] The official German news agency announced today that anti-German incidents have occurred in Upper Silesia and the Polish Corridor. Poles have been throwing stones at German residences and schools. A German theater was also forced to close.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Koenigsberg, 27th] According to well-informed sources, the German government has requested Lithuania to increase German freight imports by 25%. This request will cause changes in Lithuania's business plans with other countries. It is said that both parties will send personnel to form a joint committee to begin negotiations.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Announces King's Trip to Canada, Changes to Empress of Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the King's trip to Canada will not be on the HMS Repulse, but will instead be on the specially designated Empress of Australia to cross the Atlantic.</p>
<h3>German Army Commander-in-Chief to Arrive in Rome Today, Axis Powers Pursue Military Cooperation, Busy Troop Movements in Cologne</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 28th] The Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Brauchitsch, will arrive in Rome on the 29th to discuss matters with the Italian Army leader. He is expected to stay until the 10th of next month, then travel to Italian Libya in North Africa to confer with General Balbo. He will return to Rome on the 6th of next month to observe military exercises on the 7th of May. On the same afternoon, he will inspect various units of the Italian Army. On the 9th, he will attend the grand parade celebrating the third anniversary of the incorporation of the Italian Empire. On the 10th, he will inspect various enterprises and factories in Spezia on the west coast of Italy before returning to Germany from there.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cologne, Germany, 27th] In the past 36 hours, German troops stationed here have been very active, the likes of which has not been seen in weeks. However, according to official statements, this is merely a troop rotation with the garrison in the Rhineland.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 27th] Political circles here predict that Britain's implementation of conscription will prompt Axis powers to take immediate military steps to strengthen their position. Well-informed sources expect the Anti-Comintern Pact to be transformed into a military alliance. Italian newspapers have downplayed the importance of British conscription. However, the government and the general public all believe that this move is extremely important, which is very obvious. Furthermore, Mussolini will discuss the issue of British conscription with the cabinet on Saturday.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Encouragement to the Senators of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>The War of Resistance is still in the perilous transitional stage before victory, and the nation is still at a critical juncture of survival. How to turn danger into safety and emerge from death depends mainly on the implementation of democratic politics to realize the total mobilization of the national people's strength, supporting the government in adhering to the War of Resistance. Although the Political Consultative Council and the Senate are not truly democratic political forms, nor are they comparable to the National Assembly advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen throughout his life, the achievements from the High Leadership's instructions to the past three Political Consultative Councils can at least confirm that they can lay the initial foundation for democratic politics. Improving political institutions, enhancing government prestige, and unleashing the people's power during the War of Resistance are of even greater significance.</p>
<p>Recently, the provincial senates have been successively established or are preparing to be established, and the list of Guangdong senators has also been officially announced by the National Government. According to the Guangdong Senate Speaker's statement yesterday, the Guangdong Senate Secretariat was established in Shaozhou on the 21st of this month, and many senators staying in Hong Kong are also about to go to Shaozhou to attend the first meeting to be convened in mid-May. We express our unreserved admiration for the government's efforts to promote the establishment of provincial and municipal senates and its special emphasis on them. In particular, Guangdong's current situation is not only related to the future of Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, but also has significant implications for the entire war situation and the future of the entire nation. Therefore, we cannot help but place ardent expectations on the senators of Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>We have carefully examined the list of Guangdong senators announced by the National Government and are deeply gratified by the gathering of talents. However, we still believe that there are matters that need to be considered in the future. First, it is necessary to increase the authoritative figures from various regions and parties to gather ideas and broaden perspectives. Second, more individuals who have effectively worked hard in Guangdong's anti-aggression and national salvation efforts in the past and have prestige among the masses should be absorbed in the future. Third, the representation of overseas Chinese, women, and representatives from the agricultural and industrial sectors seems insufficient, and attention must be paid to attracting powerful figures from these sectors in the future. Furthermore, what is particularly important is the representation of young students, which cannot be found on the list. We recall that when the prelude to the Great Revolution of 1925 was about to unfold, Mr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly emphasized that the National Assembly must include representatives of the youth in order to benefit the important and great cause of the nation. We hope that the Guangdong Senate can uphold the legacy of the revolutionary mentor, be keenly aware of the needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and the power of young students, and strive to find ways to remedy this.</p>
<p>The above are just a few points on strengthening the power of the Senate. We humbly offer them with the utmost sincerity of loving the country and the government, believing that to ensure that the Senate can truly fulfill its duties as a wartime public opinion organ and assist the government in promoting the great cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, these points should be given primary consideration. We especially hope that the senators will make special efforts in this regard to promote their realization and fulfill their responsibilities as representatives of the people.</p>
<h3>United Resistance Against Aggression by England, France and the Soviet Union, England has New Proposals for the Soviet Union, Soviet-Turkish Talks on Black Sea Defense</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] "The Daily Telegraph" reported today that British Ambassador Seeds delivered a note to the Allied Government yesterday. Although the government has not denied or confirmed this, well-informed sources have learned that this news is completely accurate. The note was drafted by the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee on the 25th and includes practical suggestions that are expected to be agreed upon as a basis for mutually agreed agreements. It is reported that the Soviet government is preparing to issue a unilateral declaration, expressing that when any of its European neighbors and Turkey are subjected to aggression, the Soviet Union is determined to provide assistance. Conversely, if the Soviet Union's western border is threatened, England and France will also do their best to provide assistance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Istanbul, 27th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin arrived here today and will discuss Black Sea defense with Turkey before traveling to Bulgaria. It is generally hoped that a strong Black Sea Treaty can be achieved.</p>
<h3>British Upper and Lower Houses Pass Conscription Bill, Labour Party Objects, Amendment Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The government's motion to implement conscription was passed in the House of Commons today by a vote of 376 to 145 after one debate. The Labour Party opposed the government's sudden implementation of compulsory conscription, abandoning the principle of voluntary service. They proposed an amendment expressing no confidence in the government, but it was rejected by a vote of 142 to 380.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The Leader of the House of Lords, Lord Stanhope, representing the government, today submitted the Conscription Bill to the House of Lords. The content was the same as that submitted by the government to the House of Commons. Stanhope solemnly declared that Britain had a responsibility to guarantee Poland and Romania, and that France and the Soviet Union were also implementing compulsory military service. Lord Snell and Samuel, representing the Labour Party and Liberal Party opposition, expressed their opposition, arguing that conscription was unnecessary, as what Britain lacked was not volunteers, but munitions and training facilities. However, the House of Lords eventually passed the original bill.</p>
<p>Chamberlain</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Prime Minister Chamberlain today presented the conscription motion in the House of Commons for open discussion. The Prime Minister explained the government's failure to consult all parties beforehand, saying that the urgency of the situation left the government no time to consult. If the decision were delayed until next week, there would be a risk of being influenced by Hitler's speech. Therefore, it was necessary to wait until next Tuesday's second reading for detailed debate. The full text is expected to be released at the beginning of next week. Some believe that promises should not be broken. However, when I stated that I did not intend to implement conscription, the situation was not as critical as it is today. The scope of military expansion by various countries and the speed of its progress were also not as obvious as they are today. Therefore, at that time, it was believed that voluntary military service was sufficient to cope with the environment. However, the situation is constantly changing, and people's views change accordingly. If one does not adapt to the changes, it will inevitably lead the country into danger. In fact, what our country needs today goes beyond voluntary military service. If this system cannot be changed, then the whole country will be forced to elect, otherwise the government will have nowhere to turn, and the responsibility borne by the opponents will be extremely heavy, and the whole country will be panicked and at a loss. Now, I ask the whole House to judge whether I must keep my promise forever, or whether I should be allowed to change it. I know that you will surely understand my intention. If this is true, then the whole country will surely unanimously support this move. The government's change of heart actually began on March 29th. After March 29th, we believed that it was necessary to provide guarantees to Poland, and later made the same guarantees to Greece and Romania. Since we made these guarantees, our sense of responsibility has increased. The ultimate goal of these guarantees is to prevent war. However, in order for these guarantees to take effect, we must not only make the guaranteed countries confident, but also make all of Europe feel this way. In short, we must clarify our position. However, rumors doubting our determination, and concerns about whether we will fight to the end with France, are growing day by day. Our efforts to build military strength have been almost undermined by these doubts. This conscription system is a major departure from our past habits. This move cannot be ignored. Friendly countries abroad have been greatly comforted and encouraged by the government's determination. Although the number of annual enlistments in this conscription is limited and is not comparable to the scale of the continental countries' armies, from a military point of view, this is not an important issue. Determining a method to prevent profits from military expansion is indeed quite difficult. However, the Financial Secretary and his advisors are now working hard to seek the most perfect solution and hope to submit it to Congress as soon as possible. As for the matter of increasing private wealth during wartime, there are also measures to deal with it. If the Labour Party has any concerns about the issue of conscription, the government will do its best to find solutions. As the storm clouds of war are tightening, I would like to appeal to the opposition parties to act cautiously and not to make irreversible decisions hastily, so as not to increase doubts in other areas.</p>
<p>Attlee</p>
<p>Opposition Labour leader Attlee rose to speak amidst enthusiastic applause and read out his revised original text, saying, "When we are prepared to take the necessary steps to safeguard the security of the country and fulfill our international responsibilities:" He also said, "The nation's determination to resist any aggression has never been so firm. They are prepared to sacrifice for freedom and democracy. However, they oppose conscription because at a time when it is necessary to strengthen national strength and unity, the conscription system will weaken and divide national strength. We are determined, like anyone else, to strengthen Britain's defense in all aspects so that it can fulfill its responsibilities, prevent the outbreak of war, and repel acts of aggression. The Labour Party's firm opposition to military aggression is even greater than that of the government. The limitation on the conscription age, only conscripting youth, is not a proper way to deal with manpower. Retired naval and army personnel should be conscripted for national defense tasks such as air defense. Moreover, according to the Army Department's past experience, the real difficulty in wartime lies in the lack of organization of the supply department, because the need for materials in wartime is more urgent than manpower. Prime Minister Chamberlain's failure to forcibly conscript the nation's financial resources is inappropriate. We should suppress unnecessary luxury. Trade unions are very concerned about the conscription system, because this step will lead to the forced conscription of workers."</p>
<p>Sinclair</p>
<p>After Attlee finished speaking, Liberal Party leader Sinclair continued to declare, "This conscription will have an impact on foreign countries, such as the United States and the Soviet Union. Britain must clearly explain this matter to France, stating that Britain's contribution is completely proportional to its entire people and resources. I firmly believe that the voluntary service system is extremely beneficial. The government's reason for implementing conscription is that if this system is not implemented, it will not be possible to obtain the manpower required for national defense. However, after conscription, it will not be possible to complete the armament within a few months. If the environment changes and it is necessary to abolish the voluntary service system, I hope that the conscription system will only be applied to 20-year-old youth."</p>
<p>Churchill</p>
<p>Conservative Party stalwart Churchill expressed his support and endorsement for conscription. He said that the government's implementation of conscription is a necessary step to protect national security. This move by the government has a direct impact on safeguarding peace. Those who oppose this move must have forgotten their serious responsibilities. If this move is decided by voting, the government will also win. If the opposition party wins, it will overturn the conscription principle, and the strength of Europe's resistance to Nazi hegemony will collapse entirely. The views of the French can be cited as an example. The French said, "Assuming that a German warship strikes Gibraltar next week, within a few days, two million French troops will confront Germany." Regarding Hitler's speech tomorrow, Churchill believes that there is no need to pay attention to it. He said, "I pay no attention to Herr Hitler's speech. If he makes intimidating remarks, it will not make the current actual situation worse. If he makes assurances, I will not believe them until they are proven by action. If he makes accusations, we can ignore them. We pay too much attention to the speeches of dictators and ignore their military deployments and the expansion of their power, which is not a wise move." At this point, after several more people spoke, the government's motion was finally adopted.</p>
<p>Blum</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] Former Popular Front leader Blum published an exclusive article in the "People's Daily" yesterday, appealing to the British Labour Party on the issue of British conscription, saying, "I hereby solemnly inform my Labour Party friends that the implementation of conscription in Britain is one of the most important factors in maintaining world peace. Only those who advocate isolationism want to oppose conscription."</p>
<p>Consulting on Aid to Romania</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky arrived here today. It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador will hold secret talks with the Romanian Foreign Minister to discuss the methods by which the Soviet Union can provide military assistance to Romania. It is noteworthy that Yatsky stated in a speech in the Danish capital last night that the Romanian Federation is prepared to assist any European country that is invaded. At the same time, when the French Foreign Minister and the Romanian Foreign Minister were meeting, it was reported that they planned to formulate a plan on how England, France, and the Soviet Union should assist Romania in the event of a German invasion of Romania.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Danish Capital, 27th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Yatsky, flying from Moscow to London, made a statement to a newspaper reporter when passing through here this morning, saying, "If Western European countries are attacked, the Soviet Union is ready to provide military aid to them. This has been suggested to the British and is now awaiting their reply."</p>
<p>French-Romanian Negotiations</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 28th] According to political circles, the content of the French-Romanian negotiations is that France will continue to supply military equipment to Romania, eliminate the obstacles to Soviet-Romanian diplomacy, and conduct a comprehensive review of the international situation. It is reported that the French Foreign Minister and the Romanian Foreign Minister talked for two hours and had lunch at the French Foreign Ministry. Those present included Prime Minister Daladier and various cabinet members, as well as the ambassadors of England, France, and the Soviet Union, the Greek Minister of War, and the political circles believe that the French and Romanian political figures will also discuss Romania's relations with Hungary, Bulgaria, and the countries of the region.</p>

<h3>Legislative Council Finance Committee Decides Yesterday: Transferring Prisoners for Labor, Adding Detention Centers, Refugee Camp in Kam Tin to Have a Resident Doctor, Additional Charity Funds Await Disclosure of Usage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 27th, the Legislative Council Finance Committee held a meeting, chaired by Chief Secretary Smith. Attendees included Financial Secretary Keen, Acting Director of Public Works Deacon, Mr. Proler, Mr. Way, Mr. Chow Chun-nien, Mr. Lo Man-kam, Mr. Liao Yali, Mr. Schloss, and Mr. Pierce. There was considerable discussion on the proposal to increase funding by $1,229,182. When the first proposal was made, to increase charity funds for refugees by $250,000, Mr. Pierce requested that the details of each expenditure be announced in detail. Financial Secretary Keen replied that this could be done and that a detailed list would be provided, but that $150,000 of the $250,000 had already been spent. Mr. Pierce further stated that he did not have any complaints about the proposal, but only wanted to know its usage in detail. After all the members had reviewed the details, it was passed. The chairman then instructed Secretary Keen to proceed accordingly. Mr. Proler also suggested that the refugee camp in Kam Tin had about 4,000 people, and that the camp was too far from the hospital. If any refugees were ill, it would be very inconvenient. The government should consider sending a permanent doctor to the camp so that rapid treatment could be provided in the event of an emergency. The chairman replied that this issue could be considered. The second proposal was to use $2,500 to hire a secretary for the Women's Air Defense Association, with a monthly salary of $250. In addition to typing, the secretary would be responsible for managing the records of the members of the units and all communications. The third proposal was to print air defense booklets, with a budget of $1,500. Mr. Liao Yali and Mr. Proler both asked questions about the proposal, which the chairman explained one by one, and they were all satisfied. The fourth proposal was to increase the number of X-ray machines by $10,000. Mr. Proler was concerned that the amount was too large and asked if it was due to rising prices. Keen replied that medical work had increased significantly this year, so the need for X-rays was even more pressing and had to be increased separately. The fifth proposal was for $140,000 for public works. Mr. Proler immediately asked about its use. Director of Public Works Deacon replied that it was only for road repairs, with about $30,000 for Hong Kong, about $80,000 for Kowloon, and the rest for construction projects in New Kowloon. The sixth proposal was to build a new hospital next to the Kowloon Hospital as an infectious disease hospital, with an estimated cost of $100,000. Mr. Proler immediately asked about its detailed usage. Deacon replied that the detailed plan had not yet been drafted, and even the drawings had not been finalized. The final proposal was for a total of $169,000 for managing prisoner labor and adding detention centers. In the near future, prisoners could be moved to the new detention centers to work on road repairs or reclamation projects. The location could be in the New Territories, and the number of staff used could be less than that of Stanley Prison. Although Mr. Proler had questions, he expressed satisfaction after this explanation.

<h3>Tea House Murder Case Adjudged Yesterday: Li Bingchun Sentenced to Seven Years of Hard Labor, Sir Elsdon's Efforts to Defend the Defendant Were Ineffective, Charge of Murdering a Japanese Person Changed to Manslaughter</h3>
<p>Li Bingchun, a waiter at the Tea House at 81 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai, was charged with murdering Japanese customer Aihara Yoshiji on January 28 of this year. This case was judged in the Preliminary Court and was submitted to the Criminal Cases Review in this month. Justice MacGregor reviewed the case several times and personally inspected the scene of the murder. The witnesses in the case were interrogated successively. At 10:00 yesterday morning, MacGregor continued to convene the jury: Mr. Hostage (Chief), Mr. Johnson, Mr. Johnston Wong, Mr. Hobson, Mr. Sousa, Mr. Goura, and Mr. Chen Jinwan, for trial. The defendant pleaded not guilty and hired attorney Pu Liya to engage barrister Sir Elsdon to defend him. The Western and Chinese women and girls who came to observe the trial were still crowded, and the surrounding seats were packed. Many people from the legal profession also attended the hearing. During the trial, the official, fearing that those listening would cause disorder, ordered the court door to be closed. This shows the extent to which this case was noticed by society. As a result of the trial, barrister Sir Elsdon stood up first to defend the defendant, listing the witnesses' testimonies and the deceased's violent character as the cause of the incident. At the same time, Sir Elsdon pointed out that the cause of death may have been due to dysentery, rather than death caused by the defendant's wounds. The narration was extremely detailed. Deputy Attorney General Fei Yi, who was in charge of the prosecution, refuted each one one by one. Finally, MacGregor instructed the jury to judge the case. The jury retired for about half an hour and returned to court, unanimously finding the defendant guilty of manslaughter. The charge was declared established. The official said to the defendant, "Now, all the jurors unanimously said that you are guilty of manslaughter. This court should accept it. The jury believes that the defendant committed the crime under provocation, so the murder charge was changed to manslaughter. But the fact shows that you attacked a person with bare hands in the tea house with a fierce weapon. This is an extremely important event. If this court does not severely punish you, it will be a loss of my responsibility." After speaking, he sentenced the defendant to seven years of hard labor. The jurors who attended this case, having worked hard for too long, were granted permission to be relieved of their duties for two years. This murder case, which shocked the time, was thus declared over.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Defense Capabilities: Continued Recruitment of Chinese Gunners: The Thirty-Second Term of Enlisted Men Training Completed; Recruitment of Chinese Army and Navy Engineers Will Follow</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong military authorities, in view of the increasingly dangerous global situation, are actively promoting safety and defense measures in Hong Kong as a precautionary measure. Since the authorities decided to increase the Hong Kong garrison and recruit Chinese gunners and engineers, they have intensified their recruitment and training efforts, especially for the recruitment and training of Chinese gunners. Since the start of recruitment, the Chinese gunners have been recruited to the thirty-second term and fully trained. The number of personnel in each term ranges from fifty to more than one hundred. The recruitment of these Chinese gunners is actually 50% to 60% less expensive than recruiting British gunners, and their technical skills are not inferior. The current situation is still chaotic, and for the purpose of fully enhancing Hong Kong's safety and defense capabilities, it is necessary to continue recruiting Chinese gunners. According to military news yesterday, the Chinese gunners recruited in the thirty-second term have now completed their training and have been transferred to Aberdeen, Stanley, Stonecutters Island, and Murray Barracks. It has now been decided to plan and carry out the recruitment of the thirty-third term. The number of personnel in this term may be increased compared to previous terms, with about 150 to 300 people. This plan has been roughly drafted and can be implemented in the short term. It is also planned that after the completion of the recruitment and training of this term, the need for recruitment will be assessed based on the needs of the situation. If it is deemed necessary to recruit, recruitment will continue to ensure that Hong Kong's artillery defense capabilities reach a satisfactory and strong level. As for the number of Chinese engineers, there is also a need to increase recruitment due to the sharp progress of all defense measures. After the start of the recruitment of the 33rd term of Chinese gunners, the recruitment of Chinese army and navy engineers will also begin at the same time. Within a certain period of time, considerable engineering manpower can be obtained to meet the urgent needs in the future.</p>

The following items that could be purchased for one dollar in 1922 are now more expensive. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>| Item        | Price in 1922 | Current Price |</p>

<h3>The Battle Situation in East River is Cloudy and Uncertain: Dongguan Has Formed an Arc-Shaped Frontline: The × Attack on Lizhi'ao Failed: × Planes Have Been Flying Over Boluo and Huiyang for Days: × Gunboats Rampageously Bombard the Outside of Humen</h3>
<p>[East River Express News] There has been little change in the battles in Dongguan and Zengcheng in recent days. After our army in Dongguan advanced to the Xihu, Huangqifeng, and Huangsonggang areas in three routes, it has completed a semi-arc-shaped front, remotely controlling the × of Dongguan City, Taiping, and Shilong. In Zengcheng, our army is backing against the Luofu Mountains, overlooking the Zeng River, and also occupying a favorable position. Therefore, the battles on this road are both sides clearing their positions and vying for strongholds. There has been no major battle, forming a cloudy and uncertain situation. Here is a record of the military situation on both sides:</p>
<p>Wang Ruozhou Inspects and Comforts Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Column, was ordered to attack this time. The troops under his command were able to unite from top to bottom and concentrate at the designated location in a short period of time, completing the predetermined military plan. He assisted in encircling the × troops in Shilong, Taiping, and Dongguan City, obtaining an invaluable aid for the future offensive of our army. Yesterday, he accompanied Chief of Staff Deng Tan to the Dongjiang Bank area to comfort the subordinate teams. On the 27th, he summoned the teams in the Nanshe area on the front line to talk to them, urging them to work hard. He gathered the first battalion commander Yin Zhongming and independent detachment leader Yuan Huazhao to hold talks, and gave instructions on the future offensive and defensive plans. He will return to a certain place to guard the town in three or two days.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting All Day Along the Zeng River</p>
<p>On the 26th of this month, before dawn, the × troops in Zengcheng suddenly used more than 500 infantry and cavalry, mixed with a few small cannons, to sneak into Lizhi'ao along the Zengchuan Highway, intending to suddenly attack Futianlu. The ×th team of the Luo Department of our Third Guerrilla Zone heard the surprise and immediately sent a large army to meet the attack. When in the south of Lizhi'ao, along the Zeng River, they fought fiercely with the × troops all day long. Both sides suffered considerable casualties. The × troops were unable to advance. They confronted each other until night and were still in a stalemate. Chi Zhongkuan, the commander on the south bank of the East River, and Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the column, have separately commanded various troops to cooperate in attacking the × troops. It is expected that the × troops will be isolated and in deep, and it will be difficult to sustain. They will soon be defeated by us.</p>
<p>Lianhe and Futian Have No × Traces</p>
<p>After our army withdrew from Zengcheng, the elite troops are now mostly concentrated in the Suluo, Futian, Jigongkeng, and Sumaoping areas at the foot of Luofu Mountain, backing against the Luofu Mountains and overlooking the Zeng River, controlling the × of Zengcheng. After a large amount of replenishment in recent days, its strength has become more formidable. As for the main force of the × army, they are still gathered on the west bank of Zengkong, in the Zengcheng, Luogang, and Dapu Estuary areas, confronting each other across the river. Their continuous invasion of Sumaoping and Futian is of a restraining and probing nature. On the 24th and 25th, the × troops transported more than a dozen flat-firing cannons from the Shitan area and installed them next to the South Gate Station, with the muzzle facing the northeast bank of the Zeng River. For days, they have been forcibly pulling people from the four townships to build fortresses along the Zeng River, erecting barbed wire in the northeast suburbs of Zengcheng, and recovering the bridges that were destroyed when our army withdrew from Zengcheng. According to telephone reports from the front line in the past two days, the × in Zengcheng are still breathing and replenishing. The × who invaded Lianhe on the 13th were defeated by our Wei Chen regiment and dare not invade again. There are currently no × traces in the Lianhe and Futian areas under the jurisdiction of Boluo.</p>
<p>× Planes Fly Over Boluo for Days</p>
<p>The rain has stopped slightly in the past two days, and the weather is slightly sunny. The × planes have dispatched again in groups, rampaging over the Luofu Mountain, Lianhe, Futian, Jigongkeng, Sumaoping, and Yangtaolong areas in Boluo County, in groups of three or five. On the 24th and 25th, six × planes flew from Lizhiao, along the Bo-Zeng Highway, to spy on Boluo County, and then dropped more than a dozen bombs in Futian and Lianhe. They also flew low and dropped bombs in the Luofu Mountain area for dozens of minutes, dropping as many as twenty or thirty bombs. Statistics show that since the 15th, no less than 200 bombs have been dropped by the × in various parts of Chuanlu. However, except for the bombing of Boluo County on the 18th, most of them fell in the wilderness, so the losses are still small. On the 25th, the Zengcheng and Taipingchang Paitan areas were found to have our air force flying to reconnaissance, but no bombs were dropped. In Huiyang, rumors were spread by traitors a few days ago, and the residents disturbed themselves and evacuated themselves, which was quite pitiful. Since the party, government, and military authorities have refuted the rumors, the people's hearts have been slightly calmed down. However, on the 26th, four × warships sailed to the outside of Humen in Daya Bay and bombarded the shore, causing damage. Our losses are not great. At 10:00 AM on the 27th, an × plane flew from the Daya Bay sea area to the sky above Danshui, circling for a while, and then侦察 along the sea without dropping bombs.</p>
<p>Making Slogans to Advise × Troops</p>
<p>The Third and Fourth Guerrilla Zones, in order to promote the awareness of the × puppet soldiers that they were forced to join the war, jointly produced Chinese and Japanese slogans and leaflets, and sent personnel to infiltrate the × military defense areas and the occupied areas to post and distribute them, advising them not to be fooled by the × warlords. At the same time, they also informed the local people in the occupied areas not to be traitors, not to supply × people with food, and not to work for × people. It was found that such slogans and leaflets have been found in Dongguan City, Shilong, Taiping, and other places for days. Ming Shengzhong, the × soldier camp in Dongguan City, and Houqiang also found slogans written in white ash water on the 25th. The × army was very panicked.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Prisoners Request to Kill ×: Jointly Present a Request to the Authorities: Permission to Enlist</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Express News] The war situation in Guangdong Province is tense. Before Guangzhou fell, the Guangdong High Court and the Guangzhou Local Court, in order to evacuate the prisoners, transferred a batch of heavily sentenced prisoners to Gao Yao, Yunan, Ming Yunfu, and other county governments for separate detention. Recently, it was found that although the prisoners were in the line of dominance, they were determined to be in the same hatred, in order to slightly fulfill their national duty. Therefore, more than 100 people, including Chen Tieniu, jointly signed a petition to the prison officer, requesting the authorities to allow parole, allow them to enlist in training, and send them to the front lines to serve.</p>
<h3>Sanshui × Tightens Defense: Prevents Our Army in Gaoyao from Attacking: × Troops in the West District Rush to Build Fortifications</h3>
<p>[Xijiang News] Due to the withdrawal of the × troops in Sanshui to Siyi for combat, only about a thousand people are left. They are now shortening the defense line, and most of them are guarding the two parts of the river mouth and the southwest. The × troops scattered in various villages in the central area are concentrated in the railway area. The western area has withdrawn from Ping Tian, Jin Guan Chong Ben, and Maxi to concentrate in Zunnan, with Makou Town Nan Xinlu and Gang Gen as strongholds, obliquely echoing the river mouth. This line is opposite to our army in Gaoyao across the river. To prevent our army from crossing the river to attack, the × troops have built several buildings with triple concrete fortifications on Guabangling, relying on the mountain between Xin Xu and 　Gen, as a plan to hold fast and protect the river mouth. With the traces of the × in Chongben Township, our guerrilla team is now active in various villages in the west area and can cooperate with the regular army to fight at any time, killing the ×.</p>

<p>Men's Basketball Game Tonight</p>
<p>First Division: South China vs. Pui Ying</p>
<p>Second Division: Da Zhong vs. Kang Yuan, Youth Vocational vs. Police</p>
<p>Three men's basketball games will be held tonight (the 29th) at the YMCA gymnasium. The first game (6:30 PM) is a Second Division match between Da Zhong and Kang Yuan; the second game (7:30 PM) is a First Division match between South China and Pui Ying; the final game (8:30 PM) is a Second Division match between Youth Vocational vs. Police. The First Division game is expected to be closely contested. South China boasts aggressive players such as Shi Zhenzhi, Shi Zhenda, and Xiao Jiemin, while Chen Xinqiu, Mu Zhongjing, and Qian Shuhui are also capable of coordinating well. Pui Ying, on the other hand, has recently shown disorganization in their teamwork, and their forwards' shooting accuracy is often lacking. Although they have key players such as Pan Jinhong, Lin Wanli, Qiu Guangxie, and Li Lianze, the team as a whole has not been able to coordinate effectively. It will be difficult for them to withstand South China's attack tonight. In the Second Division match between Da Zhong and Kang Yuan, Da Zhong has better coordination and is likely to win. The Police vs. Youth Vocational match will be a fierce battle, as the Police players are physically stronger, while Youth Vocational is more agile in passing. Youth Vocational will need to fight hard to achieve victory. The First Division team lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>(South China Team) Xiao Jiemin, Lu Enjing, Qian Jinghui, Shi Zhenzhi, Shi Zhenda, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xinqiu, Chen Bangzhen;</p>
<p>(Pui Ying Team) Qiu Guangqing, Li Lianze, Pan Jinhong, Ma Xueming, Chen Zetang, He Rirong, Guan Zhutong, Liu Zemin, Lin Wanli.</p>
<p>Swimming Guide: Breaststroke, by Pan Yeshao</p>
<p>Learning the breaststroke is generally easier than learning freestyle. Many beginners who find freestyle difficult often switch to breaststroke because it requires less effort to maintain buoyancy compared to freestyle. Simple, gentle movements of the limbs make it easy to manage both floating and forward motion.</p>
<p>While the breaststroke is not difficult to learn, achieving correct form can be challenging. Even many skilled breaststrokers may inadvertently develop poor form if they are not careful. The breaststroke has the strictest form requirements in swimming rules. It is hoped that both beginners and advanced swimmers will pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>Difficulty in breathing is a common challenge in swimming, especially in breaststroke. Head movements in breaststroke must be kept straight. As the legs extend and push water for propulsion, the head is lowered into the water, and both arms extend from under the head to the chest, then sweep outwards. The angle between the arm movements and the water surface should be within 40 degrees. Avoid sweeping the arms too deeply downwards. The head should begin to rise out of the water as the arms are still returning towards the chest. This is the only opportunity to inhale. Remember that exhalation should be completed before the nose reaches the water surface.</p>
<p>Often, swimmers raise their heads too high to increase inhalation time, causing the body to tilt excessively. This excessive tilt hinders forward progress. The impact of this posture is significant: (A) The overall posture adds to the resistance against forward movement because the legs are completing the out-sweep and are straightening inwards to prepare for the next kick, while the arms have not yet extended forward. The body's buoyancy, as well as the movements of the limbs, all impede forward motion. Prolonged inhalation is not worthwhile. (B) Consequently, the body is angled during propulsion, increasing resistance against the water as the legs generate force. (C) The body is not parallel to the water surface, violating the rules.</p>
<p>Breaststroke rules also prohibit uneven shoulder height. The heels should not break the surface as the legs retract and close together. Uneven shoulder height is caused by uneven force in the arm sweeps or unequal propulsion in the leg kicks, or less frequently by inconsistent limb movements. The heels breaking the surface is related to lowering the head too much or retracting the legs in a way that deviates from the natural range of motion of the hip joint, causing the knees to sink excessively.</p>
<p>With a clear understanding of incorrect form and its causes, swimmers should focus on preventing these errors during practice and correcting existing flaws.</p>
<p>Beginner breaststroke training is divided into separate drills for breathing, arm movements, and leg movements, before combining them into the full breaststroke motion. Breathing practice: Keep the head facing forward and the upper body prone in the water, with the face and most of the head submerged. Begin exhaling as the head starts to rise. Inhale as the nostrils break the surface. Keep the lower lip extended upwards to prevent water from entering the mouth. Leg practice: Support the body in a prone position with the hands on the bottom of the pool, or hold onto the side of the pool, keeping the arms extended in line with the body. Start the leg kick by pushing water backwards with both feet simultaneously, ensuring the soles face directly backwards for maximum propulsion. Arm practice: Stand in the water, leaning forward, keep the fingers close together, and sweep the arms outwards. Greater resistance against the water leads to faster forward motion. If there is little resistance, either the arm movements are too gentle, the force is too weak, or the palms are not angled correctly to create resistance against the water.</p>

<p>Free Talk: The "Glamour" and "Elegance" of the Past by Wu Ling</p>
<p>We have always looked down on women, but sometimes we especially look up to them.</p>
<p>In history, whenever things were not "peaceful," everyone would assign women to embody the nation's honor. The way to maintain that honor was "death." When "bandits" came, the head of the household would flee, and the women would die, die, die. When foreign races invaded, civil officials advocated for peace, military generals surrendered; the women would die, die, die.</p>
<p>What happened after death? Then our writers would jump out: elegies, dirges, you would rhyme, I would rhyme; even secretly writing one first, or copying one from somewhere, forcefully planting it on a foreigner, saying it was a last poem by a certain martyred woman, and then rhyming another one, again, you would rhyme, I would rhyme. And this was called "scandalous news" and "elegant affairs," for the sake of still maintaining honor.</p>
<p>In history, there were many "scandalous news" and "elegant affairs" created by us with the help of "bandits." But the so-called "bandits" were "outlaws," all forced out by emperors and bureaucrats. If there were no emperors and bureaucrats, there would be no "scandalous news" and "elegant affairs." Therefore, our writers all supported emperors and bureaucrats. The invasion of foreign races helped create even more "scandalous news" and "elegant affairs," like the Jin people, the Yuan people, and the Manchus. We can easily investigate those achievements. These foreign races directly created "scandalous news" and "elegant affairs." But later they all became emperors and bureaucrats, so our writers ultimately supported them directly, regardless of whether they were foreign races or not. The evidence is in those traditional elegies, dirges, and rhyming poems, which never wrote about emperors and bureaucrats, nor scolded foreign races for their plundering and rape, but only desperately worked on "glamour" and "elegance." Of course, this was "for the sake of art." But finally, at this time, the "tail" was revealed: the honor they were fighting for was not the nation's honor, but only the honor of a few men who lived well.</p>
<p>But what if some women refused to die? Wouldn't that be too shameless and anti-literary? However, that was not the case. Writers had many ideas. Now, they would scold the woman on one hand, and praise the woman on the other hand. They would scold her for having no shame, and praise her for being good-looking. And then it was still "scandalous news" and "elegant affairs." This time, the "glamour" and "elegance" had to be even more "magnificent" and "rhyming." As a result, this time, the honor completely belonged to the writers.</p>
<p>What I have said above are all past situations. As for the present, there is a slight change. Women are no longer so enthusiastic about dying. Although honor is still needed, they can only think of other ways. However, our writers still seem to hold on to their past ideas, still pursuing "glamour" and "elegance." But because it is after all the modern era, the methods of pursuit have also changed, and they no longer openly display the banners of "glamour" and "elegance." They have even bigger goals.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the writers in Beiping were very enthusiastic about visiting Sai Jinhua, praising Sai Jinhua, inviting Sai Jinhua to talk, inviting her to dinner. As a result, books were published, supposedly to extract many anecdotes from the late Qing Dynasty from her mouth. But now they say that she was too ignorant and could not extract them, even though people had high expectations of her. However, even though they were disappointed, the book still had to be published. Therefore, the book did not contain any anecdotes, but boasted about the Qing Empress Dowager, praised the German Marshal, and wrote about the "Boxer Rebels" to embellish the "glamour" and "elegance."</p>
<p>A bomb landed in front of the "Great World" in Shanghai, killing many poor people, workers, and small business owners. But a socialite from elsewhere came and passed through this place and wrote a poem, saying that she seemed to have seen the broken, fashionable, modern girl with dyed fingernails, and did not see anything else. This was truly "glamorous" and "elegant."</p>
<p>Now they want to create historical works of the late Ming Dynasty. So, some writers come out and speak: Historical themes must be carefully selected. Naturally, this is right. But after selecting and selecting, they only selected Chen Yuanyuan, saying that she was more significant than the righteous people in the late Ming Dynasty who resisted the Jin people and other places. Naturally, Chen Yuanyuan's background was complex, but why was she more significant than the righteous people who resisted the Jin people? This seems very difficult to understand at first. However, if you know the underlying ideas of our writers, you will immediately understand. Chen Yuanyuan can be both "glamorous" and "elegant." On this point, those righteous people can only "feel ashamed of their inferiority."</p>
<p>Pursuing "glamour" and "elegance" is our "literary tradition." Without this "literary tradition," our literature would not have "inspiration," right?</p>
<p>Fengchuan River, Du Wenhui</p>
<p>Late autumn in September. The riverbank is full of piles of yellowish-brown rice straw after the autumn harvest. In the hazy morning mist, they look like small fortresses squatting there. Looking through the gaps between the straw piles, you can see a continuous stretch of tea-colored land. On the harvested fields, dried rice stalks stand here and there. In the distance, under the distant silvery sky, some light green of the autumn forests in the villages are revealed. The morning mist is getting thicker, and the autumn scenery of the countryside seems to be stuck in sweet syrup.</p>
<p>The river water is yellow and turbid, endlessly flowing towards an unknown place. Our dozen or so large wooden boats, loaded with bricks and tiles, are flowing down the upper reaches of the West River in a mighty manner. I am already awake. Although the river water is calm in the downstream current, I have never closed my eyes on this turbulent journey. I always feel uneasy in my mind. I listen quietly to the surging sound of the river water all night, and the asthma-like sound of the engines on those small steamers. Sometimes, I also use a pair of tired eyes to look at the tugboats and small steamships sailing upstream from the small hole in the cabin. The sharp sound of the whistle floats in the dead night sky, reaching the distant places beyond the riverbank. This "vigorous" sound wave seems to shake my cabin like a flood, shaking the heart of this traveler. So, I stared at the glittering stars in the black sky all night, looking at some village forests and thatched cottages that disappeared vaguely in the darkness, until my eyelids fell asleep unconsciously.</p>
<p>The dawn makes me feel refreshed, just like a prisoner who has obtained amnesty. I ran to the deck of the boat and sat on the bricks covered with rice straw. I looked at the scenery on both sides of the riverbank, I looked at the dawn on the edge of the vastness. My heart feels a deep emptiness. The autumn wind on the river is slightly cold, with a bit of nostalgia. I love autumn, because I grew up in the south, which has given me many passionate memories and inspired my will to live. However, in this autumn morning, I don’t have a bit of attachment. I feel that this autumn has changed, the scenery on both sides of the river has changed, and even the river water has changed. It is suffering. It is in the enemy's cruel bombing and ravaging. Everything has become as silent as the fields on the riverbank, as quiet as the river water.</p>
<p>The sky is already bright, and the golden light of the morning sun spills over the tea-colored earth, the piles of dry rice straw on the riverbank, and the turbid river water. The morning mist is gradually dissolving and disappearing. The forests and black rooftops of the distant villages are clearly visible. Our boat is sailing very fast in the wind. The gray linen sails tremble in the autumn wind. Our boat has sailed into the Fengchuan River. The Fengchuan River is a tributary of the West River. The water here is very shallow. Therefore, the partners are busy. Some are holding long bamboo poles and rowing on the silt or sandbars.</p>
<p>(To be continued) "Divine Comedy" Left Out Story, Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Dante's Edge Hell.</p>
<p>I also saw the story of hell in the world.</p>
<p>Time: A desolate midnight. The climate of midnight is originally desolate, and a few drizzles make it more gloomy.</p>
<p>Location: Next to a quiet street. Locust leaves are shaking, shaking out a rustling sound, like ghosts sighing.</p>
<p>I was striding along the roadside at a pace that was neither fast nor slow. At this time, it was still winter: the raindrops in winter are the most cruel thing, hitting the head without a hat, messing up the hair, and flowing to the corner of the forehead, forming a small waterfall, hanging all the way to the edge of the eyes. The collar of the coat was turned up very high, but it could not block the sharp wind of the winter night, and the rainwater in the wind. Cold, wanted to shake, but didn't shake. Only, striding with steps that were neither fast nor slow, neither big nor small.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, it will be even more gloomy. The faint light of the street lamp saw me shy, hiding in the gray glass lampshade, revealing half of the light. In the light in front of the lamp, I saw the raindrops forming thin lines, silver, flashing, sloping down in the wind. This is glass silk, not rain, I thought.</p>
<p>There was no one else on the street, only my soul was left.</p>
<p>The shadow of the tree, in the dim light, mottled all over the ground.</p>
<p>There was no color in the sky, only darkness, emptiness in the eyes.</p>
<p>Far away, there was a dog bark, breaking the temporary silence, but it could not dispel the desolate air. Cold, dark, quiet road, only a lonely figure. Who would have thought that there are 200 million people in the world besides me!</p>
<p>Look, in front of the foot of the gray and white high wall, there is a doorway, and there is a black shadow lying there. Moving, flashing over is a person.</p>
<p>In the calm air, there was excitement. In this calm situation, there are two active people, two souls.</p>
<p>Looking towards the light, the figure of that person clearly stood in front of me. However, a leaf just happened to cover the light on his face, so I couldn't see it. Only, there seemed to be ink-colored hair on the black shadow. Dragging down a few strands, draped on the forehead.</p>
<p>A cold body, let's go, stepped a little bigger, a little faster.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ticking footsteps followed me, it was the character of the black shadow, panting, following me. Without listening to his mourning, only the ticking footsteps, hanging in the light harmony of the wind and rain.</p>
<p>"Coming again! My lost life!" Suddenly hit my shoulder, a shout.</p>
<p>I was in a panic, only smiling.</p>
<p>"I lost my life"! The bloody throat is about to burst out sparks.</p>
<p>"Drunk"!</p>
<p>"Not drunk! I only want my lost life! My soul! I want you to teach me, save me! Return my life, soul."</p>
<p>I burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a piece of white paper came from inside. It was very wrinkled. Taking advantage of the dim light of the street lamp, I looked. However, while I was looking, he slipped away, leaving only the sound of ticking footsteps.</p>
<p>I leaned my head over, pressing under the faint light of the street lamp. On the paper, the words "Hongkou Pass" were written in big letters.</p>
<p>It turned out...</p>
<p>There was only me again on the street, rainy wind, thin lamp. Inferior Goods' Art Makeover by Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>On the eve of economic collapse, using ingenious deceptive methods to give goods an "artistic makeover," selling them to foreign markets to obtain raw materials and resources is indeed an extremely despicable and pitiful strategy.</p>
<p>They may think that bringing these goods with their iron heels is to implement their aggressive policy of controlling everything, but in our opinion, no matter how clever your methods of disguise are, you can only deceive us temporarily. We will never develop faith in them; on the contrary, we will only despise and reject them.</p>
<p>In the interior, no matter where you go, the people's patriotic enthusiasm and deep national consciousness have made life anti-Japanese. All daily necessities are mainly domestic products. Foreign goods simply cannot gain a foothold in the interior. Therefore, there is a tendency to imitate, act awkwardly, and hope to pass off fish eyes as pearls. Their products, at first, only labeled "domestic product" on the outside of the packaging, while the goods themselves still had very obvious national labels. Now, this method can be said to have improved. Even the goods themselves are "beautified." Some even label them: "Made in China" or "Made in Shanghai." The trademarks used are also constantly changing, sometimes using people, sometimes dogs, sometimes pigs, and even using things that can cater to the psychology of the Chinese people as trademarks. They print the words "purely domestic product," or fill them with products from other countries, writing: Made in...</p>
<p>Then, after being promoted by treacherous merchants who act as accomplices, they can fortunately be mixed into the pile of domestic products. However, their actions not only fail to gain a market position, but also reflect the people's steadfastness to the national concept and their full understanding of the national economy. The more they fill up with domestic products, the more it shows the strong patriotic ideas of the Chinese people. Non-domestic products cannot gain a foothold in the interior, which is really a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>People who live in Shanghai and are familiar with the local situation have a strong ability to distinguish goods and are naturally not easily deceived into buying inferior goods by mistake. For example, if a certain item is clearly labeled "Made in Shanghai," then as long as you think about it, are there manufacturers in Shanghai that produce this kind of item? If so, are they run by Chinese people? Are the raw materials used domestic? With these simple identification methods, no one will buy blindly.</p>
<p>However, this is not the case in the interior. People who do not understand the situation in Shanghai often think that products made in Shanghai are always domestic products. Therefore, to remedy this, the authorities must actively carry out effective investigations and prohibitions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is now dividing the electric power among the provincial governments of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan to order the directly responsible agencies to strictly investigate and arrest (as reported). In the future, all kinds of inferior goods, whether counterfeit, repackaged, or renamed, will probably be difficult to cross this defense line. There are also explicit penalties for treacherous merchants who repackage and transport goods, which not only has a good impact on tax revenue, but also provides many conveniences for domestic buyers, so that they do not have to hesitate. Only domestic goods can be sold, and inferior goods will naturally find it difficult to achieve the effect of passing off fish eyes as pearls.</p>
<p>In the current guerrilla areas, especially the "isolated islands," there are indeed relatively few domestic products. Inferior products with counterfeit or repackaged brands can be seen on the market at any time. Even those that are sold without any disguise are also common. Regarding this, we can only hope that people in general will destroy selfishness for the sake of public welfare, deepen their understanding of the national economy, and be vigilant about where the fire that destroys us comes from. If you think carefully, you will believe: "The money in your hand, turning a corner, will be made into a bomb, bombing yourself..." These words are based on experience, wake up! As long as we are determined not to buy, no matter how clever they are, the skills of the donkey in Guizhou are ultimately useless. Manchurian Snow by Shu Qun</p>
<p>She looked at the only acquaintance among them, grasping a broken bun like a starving dog getting a piece of meat, eating it greedily and stingily at the same time. Who knows that the bun will betray the courage of last night's thugs? Will obliterate the solemnity of today's youth? Will make people forget themselves in chewing? Towards him, she also had a new feeling, a new understanding.</p>
<p>Under her foolish gaze, he was looked at foolishly. He stopped his temporary eating and asked her:</p>
<p>"Do you want to eat?"</p>
<p>She shook her head foolishly.</p>
<p>"Why don't you eat?"</p>
<p>At this time, she was ashamed, unable to say the main reason, but said:</p>
<p>"I'm not hungry!"</p>
<p>Then, she picked up the small bread and milk and gave them to him. He divided them into three equal parts and ate them cherishly with his two comrades. She dragged over a chair and sat down, putting her head next to her only acquaintance, asking blankly:</p>
<p>"Is it just buns that you eat every day?"</p>

<h3>Guangdong's Decisive Battle Awaits: Actively Brewing, Central Government Allocates Large Quantities of New Military Equipment, Rumor Says 10,000 New Soldiers Have Arrived in Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Northern River Quick Report] In recent days, the battles in the eastern, western, and northern parts of Guangdong province have somewhat subsided. Our army's offensives over the past ten days have secured a militarily advantageous and proactive position, controlling the entire front. We are now actively adjusting and replenishing, preparing for another major offensive. The enemy, in a desperate struggle, is also intensifying its defensive arrangements. A decisive battle between our unprecedented main forces and the enemy is actively brewing. The military situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Our Army Deploys Strict Formations</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Yu of the Fourth War Zone, in order to meticulously arrange deployments and achieve significant victories, personally inspected the defenses on the front lines and reviewed combat troops over the past ten days. He has now returned to a certain location to plan military operations. He is making significant adjustments and replenishments to the military strength in various parts of Guangdong province, and secretly and strictly deploying offensive formations. According to military news, the central government authorities, in order to enhance the strength of the Guangdong army, have specially allocated a large number of newly manufactured modern firearms, ammunition, heavy artillery, and other equipment to the Fourth War Zone for use. This batch of military equipment has been continuously transported south to Guangdong, and Acting Commander Zhang has distributed them to the regular army and guerrillas on each front. Therefore, the equipment of the frontline troops is abundant and their strength is exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements in Guangdong: Busy with Mobilization</p>
<p>According to another report, the enemy in Guangdong has been extremely fearful since suffering our army's surprise attack. Desperate to resist, they urgently telegraphed Tokyo and Taiwan for assistance. It is rumored that 10,000 enemy soldiers have recently arrived in South China to participate in the war, landing at Humen and Huangpu Xinsha in the Pearl River Estuary for days, and heading to various routes in the eastern, western, and northern rivers as reinforcements. It is estimated that about 2,000 troops are stationed in Dongguan and Shilong on the south bank of the East River, several thousand troops are stationed in the Zengcong area north of the East River, and 1,000 to 2,000 troops are stationed on the frontal Guangdong road and the Sanshui front line. Among them, the largest number is concentrated in the Jiujiang Ronggui Daliang Jiangmen area in the lower reaches of the West River, totaling nearly 10,000 people. Their mobilization is extremely frequent. Observing their movements, it seems they intend to fully occupy the Five Districts, open up the southern route of the West River, and contain our entire counter-offensive strategy. Upon receiving the report, the authorities have ordered the frontline troops to strictly prevent this.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang: Enemy Suddenly Increases Several Thousand Troops, Attacks Our Gulao Unsuccessfully, Enemy Attempts to Contain Our Army on the Western Route, Situation in Sanzou Disturbed, Details Unclear</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Quick Report] The enemy commander Ando, recently, in order to contain our army on the western route, has greatly increased troops in Jiujiang and Heqing. As of the 27th, 3,000 to 4,000 people have been deployed and stationed in Dalu, the Chamber of Commerce, Xuexian Temple, and various parts of Shaqou Heqing, and a large number of motorboats and electric boats have been gathered on the Shaqou River surface. According to military news yesterday, on the morning of the 27th, the enemy in Jiujiang suddenly used more than 20 motorboats, carrying 400 to 500 enemy soldiers, to attack Gulao from the Heqing area under the cover of artillery fire. Our army, relying on coastal fortifications for cover, calmly responded. The enemy motorboats approached the coast several times but were unsuccessful. It is reported that the enemy's artillery fire gradually lost its target, and the enemy troops could not hold out and quickly collapsed and retreated. At the same time as the enemy attacked Gulao, more than ten enemy motorboats approached Sanzou and Gulao, and fierce fighting broke out with our garrison. It is reported that the fighting continued until after dark and the enemy had not yet retreated. The situation is unknown because no information has been received.</p>
<h3>Along the Minxi and Southern Jiangxi Lines (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mo Pinglan</p>
<p>The Mian River that runs through Ruijin is simply a yellow river. Especially during the season of continuous spring rains, the entire city uses muddy and sandy yellow water. Drinking soup without tea leaves already turns it yellow. The cleanliness of drinking water is indeed an important issue in Ruijin. The residents of Ruijin are very fond of alcohol. Usually, they don't have teapots at home, but they have wine pots. Because Ruijin is a small plain in the mountains, with abundant products, the people have become lazy. Although the people's habits are lazy, the folk customs are strong and simple. According to an official from the Ruijin County Judicial Office, since the beginning of this year, the office has not received a single civil case, but there have been as many as fifteen criminal cases each month. Because of the strong folk customs, disputes often occur in small accidents. Most disputes are not taken to court, and if they are, they are mostly major cases involving loss of life.</p>
<p>Today, Ruijin is truly a transportation hub for the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. The Minxiang main line runs through it, and there are the Ruiyun Road to the west, the Ningwu branch line to the north, the Ruining Highway, and the Ruihui Highway to the south. Its position is becoming increasingly important. The flames of war in northern Jiangxi have spread across the Xiu River. Ruijin, an important town in southern Jiangxi, should not be allowed to remain asleep. It should be awakened and take on the practical responsibility of supplying the front lines in northern Jiangxi. This is the reporter's hope for Ruijin.</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Ruijin waiting for a northbound car for three days, feeling as cramped as a banished guest in a small world, very depressed. With the emergency in northern Jiangxi, southern Jiangxi inevitably has many rumors. Some say that Nanchang has ordered the evacuation of the population. Some say that a southbound car to Ningdu was strafed by Japanese aircraft, and the driver was injured. In half-belief and half-doubt, the reporter was even more eager to find out the truth, so he went to the station to inquire when there would be a car heading north. It seemed that the front lines were very urgent. The telephone in the stationmaster's office had never stopped ringing. The stationmaster shook his head and did not agree to the passengers' requests. Later, he could not avoid it and pointed to the groaning driver in the car, telling the reporter that the car had just left Ningdu and was about thirty miles away from Ruijin when it was robbed by bandits. The driver, loyal to his duty, drove the car straight ahead and was hit by two bullets. Fortunately, the passengers were unharmed. This car was prepared to take the injured driver to a hospital in the rear for treatment. The reporter repeatedly requested to accompany the car north, but to no avail. Later, he received the kindness of an adjutant from the Jiangxi Provincial Government, who agreed to take the reporter to Ningdu to decide on further action. At 1 p.m., three heavy-duty trucks carrying important military supplies headed straight for Ningdu. The obese driver had no intention of admiring the white green manure on both sides of the highway, only dozing off to recuperate.</p>
<p>After the car arrived in Ningdu, the reporter got off at the Dagong Hotel next to the station. The prices in Ningdu are really low. A room costs only forty cents a day, including food and lodging, and the food is quite good. The people of Ningdu seem to be retaliating for the salt blockade of the past, using salt desperately when seasoning, fearing that there is not enough salt. The Mei River and the Mian River are the same, both are in the upper reaches of the Gong River, but the water in the Mei River is slightly deeper than that in the Mian River. It is not like Ruijin, where the whole city has to drink yellow soil water after a mountain flood.</p>
<p>Ningdu was the ancient seat of Ning Prefecture and is now the location of the Eighth District Commissioner's Office of Jiangxi. After the calamity, it is desolate and has not fully recovered its vitality. The city faces the upper reaches of the Gong River, with mountains surrounding the west bank of the Mei River on all sides, and a plain in the middle, with tens of thousands of acres of fertile land, which cannot be considered a rich area in the mountains. To the northwest is Jinjing Mountain, with twelve peaks, each with its own charm. Among the twelve peaks, Cuiwei Peak is the most amazing, with four sides like cut, and a flat top. In past dynasties, when there were disturbances, the people of the county often took refuge here.</p>
<p>The city walls of Ningdu are simply difficult to find. The remaining walls are desolate, with weeds growing everywhere. Occasionally, there are some monuments, mostly red in color. According to the view of a friend from Ningdu, Mr. Wang, this is because the geology of Jiangxi is mainly red sandstone. Various slogans and pictures are plastered all over the city walls and houses. The newest and most eye-catching ones are the striking propaganda painted by the Youth Service Corps of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Eighth District Working Corps of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department. The reporter stayed in Ningdu for a day. Besides seeing some propaganda paintings and calligraphy, he did not see any other powerful shock. The impressions in all aspects were so faint that he almost forgot that he was on the second line, only two hundred kilometers away from the front line.</p>
<p>The Baoxue of Western Jiangxi is famous throughout the country. Baoxue is a kind of civil education organization that emerged with the Baojia system. It is an organization that combines popular education and adult literacy education. Its ultimate goal is to achieve the integration of "management, education, health, and defense." Therefore, the "Provisional Measures for Establishing Baoxue in Jiangxi Province" stipulates: "Each county's Baoxue takes the entire local society as the scope of education, and all the people as the objects of education." Its ideals are similar to the basic education of Guangxi Province and the national education of Fujian Province. If it is done well, Baoxue is truly the spiritual cradle of the Jiangxi compatriots. However, although Jiangxi today has 15,000 Baoxue schools, according to the reporter's observation in Ruijin and Ningdu, the simplicity of the equipment, the difficulty of funding, and the excessive compensation are all sufficient to hinder the development of Baoxue. The sacred war of defense in northern Jiangxi has begun. As the rear, southern Jiangxi should strive to rectify Baoxue to conform to the great call for spiritual mobilization. In the reporter's personal opinion, to improve and enrich Baoxue, southern Jiangxi should quickly strengthen the organization and activities of the Baojia itself, seek the stability of Baoxue's economy, carefully select teachers, and limit the initial tasks of completing Baoxue in order to obtain practical needs and responses.</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Ningdu for a day. Nanchang had fallen into enemy hands. To report the truth, the passenger car was no longer running. The three military vehicles that brought the reporter to Ningdu also rushed north last night. Being left alone in the deserted Ningdu, the reporter was very worried. The flames of war in northern Jiangxi will definitely reach central Jiangxi. When will southern Jiangxi be able to stand up straight?</p>
<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3>Wireless Cinema Declared Success: First Public Exhibition at the Golden Gate Exposition, Aelsi-Ae Company Builds Studio</h3>
<p>Wireless cinema, this scientific marvel of electronics that has been clamoring for a long time, has now finally become a reality, as announced by scientists from Aelsi-Ae Radio Company.</p>
<p>Guests visiting the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco this time not only witnessed a real home wireless movie camera, they can also have the opportunity to personally act as the protagonist shown on the wireless movie camera. According to officials from the Radio Corporation of America, this is the first time that the secret of the largest public wireless movie with the largest electric power on the Pacific coast of the United States has been performed.</p>
<p>Aelsi-Ae Radio Company is currently building a building covering an area of ​​5,000 square feet for wireless movie studios and screening rooms. The programs include news reports, movies, and other things. Even at home, you can watch it. It fully demonstrates the representative of wireless art.</p>
<p>For foreign visitors, the administrator directly leads them to the wireless movie studio, where they can stand in front of the electric eye of the wireless movie camera, so that other people who come with them can see his shape and hear his voice from the wireless movie camera in the adjacent room, and he can also see them from a glass window. The equipment of lighting is as important as in the studio for shooting ordinary films, so it is also prepared to illuminate the necessary.</p>
<p>In the filming room, you can see direct or black-and-white portraits reflected from a glass on the surface of the shadow receiving tube of the wireless movie camera. The diameter of the shadow receiving tube surface is twelve inches, and the size of the portrait reflected on it is nearly eight to twelve inches.</p>
<p>In the studio, there are two parts of shadow receiving and transmitting. One end of the latter is equipped with a shadow developing tube (electric eye) to connect to the film of an ordinary camera. In addition, this shadow tube has the effect of making the optical portrait electrically sensitive. The light transmission lens of the camera is used to concentrate the object on a metal sheet. Its surface is coated with countless tiny shadow liquid colloids, and it has strong photosensitivity to show accurate black and white. At the other end of the shadow developing tube is an electric eye. He is a command electron to seal the light, and after quickly moving back and forth, the portrait is electrically sensitive and fixed on the metal sheet. As for shadow receiving, it is equipped with a shadow receiving tube. Reversing the order of transmission and amplifying the portrait and controlling the strength of the electric power. This kind of electric power is thrown on the luminous surface, and after moving quickly back and forth, it becomes an image. Its speed is extremely fast, and it can pass through 4,500 miles per hour, and the result allows our naked eyes to see the image at any time.</p>
<h3>Words of Movie People</h3>
<p>Words of movie people, in the ears of outsiders, will feel inexplicable. This is also like our generation of non-Yangbang people going to a barber shop and seeing a beautiful woman come in. After sweeping away the codes, they jabber. Although they know they are commenting, but only they themselves know whether it is good or bad. Sometimes it is like this in the movie city, although the movie city is not a barber shop.</p>
<p>Here, I want to publicize the secret language of movie people, so that movie fans can understand the meaning. However, I am not an expert, but only cite a few points that I know.</p>
<p>(1) One factory and two factories mean wives and concubines. People in the movie city call the first wife the main factory, and the concubine the sub-factory. As for the third and fourth factories, it depends on each person's economic strength.</p>
<p>(2) Follow the lens: If a lustful person finds a target in the park, where she walks, I walk, where she stops, I stop. This is what Shanghainese call "A, B, C," and the meaning of "follow the lens" in the mouths of movie people is also here.</p>
<p>(3) Focus on Fox: To attack an object, you must recognize its focus, so you must be careful about Fox. Friends of the volcano, each has their own preferences for Shun women, and cast a fiery gaze, this is what is called focus on Fox.</p>
<p>(4) Loud Voice: Suppose A and B want to watch "Birds Flying Together" in Nanjing but don't have money. C happens to be next to them, and he is carrying money. So A says to B: "You should treat today and watch a movie." B replies: "Treat? Don't take it to heart. If I have money today, I will not only treat you to see it, but I will also invite Mr. C." At this time, if Mr. C automatically squeezes up and says, "I invite you," this is the success of the loud voice tape. The beauty of the loud voice tape lies in the fact that the one who releases it is calm, and the one who is released does not feel that he has been tricked. As far as I know in the movie people, the first one to promote is Mr. Han Langan.</p>
<p>(5) Push the lens: This is a ridiculous term. I am not convenient to explain it directly. Fortunately, readers are smart people and can understand it by the words themselves.</p>
<p>(6) Champagne: If a jockey wants to run the first horse, he must pat the horse's butt hard. To put it bluntly, running champagne is flattering.</p>
<p>(7) Open Green: Its meaning is the same as running champagne.</p>
<p>(8) Copier: Calling wives and concubines factories, but some are also called copiers. Someone just got married for half a year and already had a son, and said that this copier must be from a strange source. Otherwise, if you don't get half a son or a daughter for several years, maybe the copier has a problem and it is necessary to inspect it, so you must ask a doctor.</p>
<p>Others, I can't remember for a while, I will write to the readers when I have a chance.</p>

<p>"No, if a bomb hits, it will only be worse in the cellar." At this moment, the outside air suddenly became unusually solemn and terrifying. Inside, there were only the two of them, lonely in the darkness.</p>
<p>"I love you, Hallett." She said simply. "You like me too, don't you, darling?"</p>
<p>"Have I said that?"</p>
<p>"Of course not, you must not admit it. You will not change your style."</p>
<p>Hallett said nothing, just kissing her lips affectionately. She sighed intoxicated, ran to the window, and looked out.</p>
<p>"Hallett." She cried in surprise. Her eyes widened, looking at the fire outside, "Don't you think the whole world has entered a war?"</p>
<p>Hallett was sitting at the piano, pressing the keys. "I can't think about it. If you ask me why, I don't want to imagine it anymore."</p>
<p>"I know why, its purpose is nothing more than to kill us! You and me, because we are ordinary people, and for us, these killing weapons are still a pity. Hallett, can you play hymns?"</p>
<p>"Of course," she began to play "Salvation Army Song" Following the slow and solemn tune, he sang, Elaine moved from the window to behind him, putting her hands on his shoulders. The sound of the war outside increased sharply. Elaine echoed Hallett singing:</p>
<p>Forward, Salvation Army,</p>
<p>Bearing the cross of Christ, marching to war………</p>
<p>The bomb hit the Monroe Hotel, and the walls and floors began to shatter. The flames of war swallowed Hallett and Elaine, but their singing seemed louder, clearer, fearless, rising, rising to no end. (The End)</p>

<h3>Today's Jia Shan Football Showdown: Eastern vs. Navy for Second Place, Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to Show Their Skills</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Exclusive] In the first-division football league, Nan Wah defeated the Navy last Saturday, crowning them champion. This caused the second-place position to shift. Since the Navy was defeated by Nan Wah, their score is the same as Eastern's. Therefore, there must be a second-place showdown to decide the winner.</p>
<p>The Navy has been fighting for several months since the start of the football season. Their performance has been excellent, their position has been consistently in the top one or two, and they even once surpassed Nan Wah. Expectations for the championship were very high. Who knew they would have a hard time maintaining their lead, and success was just out of reach? After being defeated by Nan Wah, their dream of winning the championship was broken, and even their hope for second place was hanging by a thread. Such bad luck can be described as full of misfortune.</p>
<p>Having lost the championship, they hope to get second place. Although it is better than nothing, it is still a glorious thing. Therefore, it is expected that the Navy will fight hard in today's game in order to achieve victory in their final attempt. However, as the outcome of the game is unpredictable, success or failure is uncertain.</p>
<p>Since entering the second round of the competition, Eastern has often been on a good track and has maintained a record of no losses. Such a military exploit can be called rare. When they went south with their troops, they also won many victories. They returned with a beautiful record of seven wins and one draw in nine games. In addition, Shanghai famous generals Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting will be performing today. The whole army is complete, and they are confident of victory. If they win this battle, the creative team of our Hua team will complete the championship and runner-up of the league.</p>
<p>The lineup that Eastern has set is slightly different from before. The goalkeeper position will still be held by Xu Heng, whose performances in the three games in Saigon were all good. There have also been changes to the two inside defenders. Because Miao Huaguo was injured and returned from the southern expedition and still needs to rest, the left inside defender position will be replaced by Luo Weiquan. Partnering with Luo will be Jiang Shanjing, who was famous in Shanghai before. Jiang is known for his bravery and is an outstanding talent as an inside defender. Eastern is very fortunate to have invited him to participate in the war. However, Luo was transferred from the forward and Jiang is working with him for the first time. It is unknown whether they are not used to the position and connection. Therefore, this point is quite worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Song Jin's ankle was injured and he did not recover for a month, so he was unable to participate in the southern expedition. He is not listed on the list today, and Zeng Zhongyun is guarding the center back. Zeng is good at positional warfare and is not affected. However, when Yu Qiaxing is on the left side, he is facing the Navy's Armstrong, and his ability to resist may not be enough.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are some flaws in Eastern's defense because there have been many changes. If they are united in their determination to win, they can compensate for their shortcomings by working hard. Otherwise, there will inevitably be loopholes in the front line, or the Navy's forwards may take the opportunity to invade.</p>
<p>Because Hou Chengtou is on a trip to the Philippines, there is one less person who is good at shooting. However, with Cao Qiuting filling the position, this man is also extremely agile, capable of rushing and shooting, and has a similar style to Hou. Judging from this southern expedition, Cao has scored the most goals besides Li Deqi. He will play on the left wing today and there should be no major problem.</p>
<p>In short, Eastern's front line is well-arranged and there is no doubt that they can threaten the Navy. They are also capable of exerting their power and winning. However, what is worrying is that their defensive strength is not easy to restrain the progress of the Navy's forwards. Therefore, I predict that the key to Eastern's victory or defeat in this battle is not in the front line but in the back. If their defense is effective, the response is thorough, and they can maintain their position without losing, then victory is assured.</p>
<p>The weather has been unpredictable lately. If it rains again today, Eastern is not used to water warfare, which will have a big impact. I hope God will clear the weather and provide more convenience.</p>
<p>The Navy's lineup is slightly different from when they fought Nan Wah last week. Han Nivilo has left with the Hong Kong team to conquer the Philippines. Therefore, the left forward position will be taken by Lie Li. Center back Tano has also left, replaced by Los Angeles. There have also been minor changes to the front line. The overall strength is not as strong as when they fought Nan Wah. If the members of Eastern work hard and know the difference between reality and falsehood, it will not be difficult to defeat them and win the second place.</p>
<p>The match will be held at Caroline Hill, and the battle will begin at 4:45 p.m. The lineups for both sides are as follows (Tai Sui):</p>
<p>Eastern</p>
<p>Xu Heng Luo Weiquan Jiang Shanjing Yu Qiaxing Zeng Zhongyun Liu Shizan Cao Qiuting Xu Jingcheng Li Deqi Xu Wenkui Chen Bingtou</p>
<p>Navy Team</p>
<p>De Jia Chen Xuan Di Ge Lian Chen Gan Nili Shi Lao Lusi Lie Liyan Gao Lu Shi Mo Ya Shi Mo Li Shi Tuo Ban Shi Delang</p>
