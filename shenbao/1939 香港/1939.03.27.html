<p>社評</p>
<h3>大戰危機與蘇聯</h3>
<p>老大的俄羅斯，自從革命成功，建立『蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯邦』以後，即已脫離資本主義的舊世界，雖被資本主義各國聯合的封鎖與進攻，亦卒爲少壯的革命的紅軍所擊退，而能致力於社會主義國家與理想的幸福的新世界的建設，表面上形成『與世隔絕』的狀態。在短短二十一年中間，他們戰勝了國家先天的一切貧乏與困苦，他們戰勝了一切帝俄遺孽，反動份子；他們戰勝了革命陣綫的叛徒奸細和左右傾份子，他們更戰勝了國際帝國主義，法西斯匪徒形形式式的煽亂和進攻，他們還在不斷的艱苦的戰鬥中，完成了第一第二兩個五年計劃，完成了消滅人壓迫人，人剝削人的制度及其根源，完成了無分階級的社會主義的建設，並且順利地開始其發展國民經濟實現幸福生活的第三個五年計劃。他們在二十一年的苦鬥中，造成了追上一切資本主義國家的實力強大的國家，替舊世界人類證明：放棄資本主義帝國主義而藉勤勞人民的力量，可以建設一個更鞏固更激底的幸福的國家！特別値得注意的是他們運用和自然鬥爭的武器，他們有開發不盡的富源，他們不需要爭奪殖民地，不需要侵略他國，他們只需要在各國相安的環境中去努力建設。因此他們堅主保衛世界和平的政策，反對法西斯侵略，反對爭奪殖民地重分世界的帝國主義戰爭，同時採取援助被壓迫民族反對侵略戰爭的解放運動。蘇聯二十一年來打破歷史前例的偉大的成功，雖然引起少數頑固份子與資本主義首腦的妒忌，而蘇聯保護和平反對法西斯侵略的政策與行動，則不僅爲世界愛自由愛和平的人類所擁護，同時亦不得不爲一切要求維持民主維持和平的資本主義國家所信賴。因此每當國際情勢稍趨平靜之時，資本主義各國的反蘇工作便形活躍，而當世界戰爭風雲緊張之際，則要求民主和平的各國便不能不正視蘇聯的動態，甚至有所仰賴於蘇聯的動態。也因此，在世界大戰與和平的危急關頭，蘇聯便有其舉足輕重甚至於有其决定的地位。</p>
<p>最近希特勒悍然燬棄其手訂的慕尼黑協定，兩砲併吞捷克，輕騎佔領美末爾，一紙協定攫得羅馬尼亞，造成了歐州以至世界大戰的空前危局，一方面無情地揭露了民主和平國家過去僞善怯懦妥協政策的醜惡與禍患，另一方面則證明了蘇聯所謂實行集體妥全制度與武力保衛和平之政策的正確與急需。於是全世界光其是正受法西斯毒焰薰燃的英法各國人民，一致熱烈要求立卽聯合蘇聯，實行民主和平各國六團結。建立集體安全制度，共同反對及制裁法西斯侵略者。因爲祇有這樣才能保衛民主政治，維護世界和平。而英法美各國當局，在此緊急萬分的局勢與奔騰湃澎的怒潮中，亦不得不開始改變對蘇聯的態度，如最近英國之進行英蘇經濟合作，進而談判政治合作（英海外貿易大臣赫德森等現在莫斯科進行談判），以及對於德國併捷事件之舉行英法蘇各國協商，便是民主和平各國親蘇政策的初步表現。特別値得注意的是，昨（二十五）日華盛頓電宣稱，美國外交商務專家觀察，英法兩國已肯定的放棄壓制蘇聯勞力的政策，使四強制止希特勒宣言更有成功希望。他們還強調指出：「蘇俄實力，足以阻擋德國之東進而有餘，至於蘇俄在遠東之地位，觀乎日在華之應付乏力，蘇俄實力更足以應付日本德國之夾攻而無愧色。更爲重要的，卽是除西伯利亞鐵路外，最近祕密完成一重要交通綫，與外蒙公路聯絡，此交通綫對於戰時交通，極爲重要。又在中日戰事期中，蘇聯當局曾不斷加強遠東實力，其勢殊不可侮」這種觀察雖嫌空泛，但亦可見資本主義國家對於蘇聯今日决定世界命運之地位的重視了。不過僅僅這種新的認識和期待還是不够的，全世界要求維護民主與和平的國家，在這新的世界大戰威脅逐漸廣泛與嚴重之際，不僅急應迅速放棄過去壓制蘇聯的誤國誤世的政策，並且還要切切實實的聯合蘇聯及全世界擁護和平政策的一切勢力，完成民主和平國家的大團結，鞏固和擴大民主和平陣綫，迅速廣大地展開反法西斯反侵略的運動。如果各國能够迅速堅决實行這種步驟，以法西斯侵略者內部困難與危機的嚴重及其相互間矛盾的尖銳存在，則可斷言必能制止正在擴大與嚴重的世界大戰危機，而實現一切國際糾紛之獲得和平與合理的解决。至於我們英勇抗戰中力求解放的中國，則應根據此種認識，加緊中蘇兩大民族之親密合作，密切對蘇聯的各種聯繫，促進民主和平陣線的鞏固與擴大，並且堅决反對一切用『反共』『和平』等煙慕所掩蔽着的×人的毒計和漢好的陰謀。</p>
<h3>對廣東省參議會熱烈的祈望</h3>
<p>— 孫德華</p>
<p>中國國民黨于去年四月間臨時全國代表大會宣言中，就很　確　說出：「抗戰之勝負，不僅取决于兵力，猶取决于民力」，隨着召集之國民參政會，相當集中了全國優秀份子，各抗日黨派的代表共勷國是，無疑的，國民參政會召集以來，對民主政治有了一大踏步的推進，同時也曾造了不少的成續，然而，抗戰的需要，使民主政治必要有更大的進展才能克負起當前的任務，才能更順利的動昌起全民族的力量去克服困難，爭取抗戰的勝利，這須要更迅速更大量的組織與訓練各階層羣衆，同時要將民意機關的組織更加推進，將國民參政會的精神更加發揚光大起來，成立省市縣各級民意機關是急不容緩的工作。</p>
<p>第二屆國民參政會議决而且經政府决定了召集省市縣各級參議會，第三屆國民參政會通過了好幾個推進民主政治的提案，蔣委員長在閉幕辭中，亦說：「本會的歷出的使命，是要建立民主政治的基礎，是建立永久的眞正的民主政治的基礎」。一國的人民，如果不能關切他們自身的幸福，管理他們自已共同的事務，就是說，如果人民不能積極參加政治的活，他們就不能做成强固的國家。所以世界最有力，最鞏固的政治，一定是建立在民意之上，一定是以人民的利害爲利害，人民的視聽爲視聽『。省市縣參議會的召集，正是滴應中華民族的利益，正是符合抗戰的迫切須要、正是執行蔣議長這一個訓示的。</p>
<p>現在，廣東省參議會已經决定在四月初旬召開，而且當局己經將一部份候圈人選定，這是抗戰中推進民主政治的佳音，是每一個廣東同胞所深切盼望雀躍欣慰與熱烈擁護的。</p>
<p>爲　使省參　會能負起偉大的使命，使廣東的政洽，能够「建立在民意之上，一定是以八民的利害爲利害，人民的視聽為視聽』，在國民政府與最高領袖領導下，加強政府與民眾的密切關係，動員與大筆眾的力量，克服抗戰中的困難，將×兵驅逐出境，發揚革命策源地的光榮傳統，收復一切失地建立三民主義新中國，對行將召集廣東省參議會，謹提如下熱烈的祈望。</p>
<p>第一，祈望廣東省議會成為真正能代表全省民眾意見的民意機關，要真誠實現蔣委員長的『以人民的利害為利害，視總為視聽」的指示，省參議會必定要繼承與發場光大國民參政會的精神，就必要做到。</p>
<p>（一）包含各抗日黨派的代表，不只要包含領導抗戰的國共兩大政黨的代表，而且要句含一切抗日黨派如第三黨青年黨與國社黨的代表，因爲各抗日黨派都是各階級羣衆中最有政治覺悟最優秀的組織，能够最敏銳最適切的將各階級人民利害與視聽提出來，同時可以在參議會中在「民族第一」前提下適當的具體的解决，將意志集中起來，一致爲民族解放抗戰勝利而努力</p>
<p>（二）包含各階階各職業團體各界的代表者與優秀份子，在國民參政會中包羅了一些文化經濟團體中的優秀份子，和在社曾事業上著有信譽得人民　護的優秀份子，但是，爲着使省參議會更能代表與反　民衆利害與視聽，還必須將工農兵學商的代表選拔出來一致努力。</p>
<p>（三）盡可能吸收在抗日運動中有能力有威信的人物，盡可能選段靑年學生的代表、盡可能增加婦女代表，孫中山先生一向重視靑年學生與婦女在革命中的偉大作用，孫中山先生在講演中常說到學生要參加國民會議，中華民國是大家的家庭，婦女也是家庭的主人，所以省參議會必須秉承孫中山先生的遺　，盡量選拔靑年學生與婦女的代表，尤其是在抗日邋動中有能力有威信的人物。爲此，省參議員資格上年齡的限制最好實行某程度的降低，以便年靑的民族優秀份子能盡力献身國家民族。</p>
<p>（四）增加華僑代表參議員的名額，廣東省僑胞特多，廣伽于印度支那南洋及美洲各地，對祖國解放與民族抗戰事業素其熱忱，不論從精神上物質上人力上國際宣傳上說來，都必需將各地僑胞代表選拔到省參議會中來。</p>
<p>第二，祈望省參議會能成為健全的反眏全省民意的總機關，省參議會還只是民主政治初步推進的一個重要環節，還只是反映全省民意的一個初步的必要的步驟與機構，蔣委員長說：「要得到抗戰勝利，建國成功，絕不能專賴兵力，必須動員民　的精神，組織民衆已發動的精神，以全國精神意志力量的總和，來做前方將士的後盾，來做後方開發的原動力，所以，繼國民參政會之後召集省參議會，全樣的，要省參議能够真實完滿反映出全省的民意，就要繼省參議會之後迅速召集市縣參議會，甚至區鄉的參議會。</p>
<p>第三，祈望在省參議會成立前，全省發動一個參政運動，將省參議會的建立，作爲人民參政運動廣泛深入的敎育與動員，使人民能够充分了解參議會成立的意思，懂得參議會是自己意見的代表機關，懂得什麽是民權主義，積極的將意見提供出來使參議會的討論與建設更充實，使政府更能深切了解民衆的意向要求，同時，各參議員候選人，在參加參議會之前，最好能够深入民間，了解人民羣衆情緒願慾，反映到政府中去，而且，各參議員之產生，最好盡紮做到民選</p>
<p>廣東是革命策源地，是革命偉人孫中山先生的故鄉，是國民革命的聖地，對于抗戰建國應該盡最大的努力，對民主政治的推進，應該起最模範的作用，在蔣委員長張司令長官與李主席的領導下，在全省同胞的努力下。廣東省參議會的成立，可以推動全國民主政治的進步，同時必定可以迅速定出動員全廣東民衆力量的辦法，去爭取抗戰勝利建國成功！</p>
<h3>華僑教育在菲島</h3>
<p>— 靜桐</p>
<p>在三年前，海外幾個願意從事新敎育工作的靑年，他們不怕物質困難，不避環境阻撓，毅然地創辦了一個洪光學校。這雖　不能算爲甚麽了不得的大事業，可是在這拜金主義的華僑社會，他們沒有甚麽經濟的奧援，而敢於把學校辦起來，已經可以算是創舉。他們雖然沒有「古廟活菩薩」與「生活的書」中一些從事生活敎育的先淮們那種苦幹的精神，可是在這食古不化，墨守成規的華僑社會，與陳腐的敎育氣氛中，他們敢於大聲疾呼改善華僑敎育的積弊，與惡劣的環境，作無情的鬥爭，與不斷地介紹。</p>
<p>陶行知的生活敎育的理論到南洋來。且在物質條件極端困難情况之下，他們不光是在說，而是在做，他們能够體己力行地去把這新的育育機構建立了起來。在這個學校，他們敎着小朋友應用大腦與雙手，試試看「勞力上勞心』，是不是正確的道理，在整個工作上，他們也在儘可能地去應甩敎學做合一的理論。在實際行動上去敎育別人，同是也在敎育自己。</p>
<p>綏戰發動的前後，這個學校剛產了九個月，他們嚮應了全國敎聯會的國難教育方案。推動了文化宣傳救亡的工作。自從「七七」事變，神聖的民族抗戰，展開了以後，全校的同事與同學，他們在廿一個月的長時期裏，他們在節衣縮食的情况之下，參加了各種的捐輸工作，無論是購買救國公債，捐輸戰費，徵集慰勞物品，徵集寒衣，做救傷袋，寫慰勞信，捐助航空建設，救濟難童捐欵，參加義賣，以至最近的一元還債工作，他們都竭盡了他們微薄的力量。許多同學除了實行節約，節省下他們逐日三幾分錢的零星糠菒費，進行經常的救國儲金以外，他們還利用星期日星期六（下午沒有課）和公共假日，為僑眾擦皮鞋，把收入作爲購「菲　華僑學生號」飛機的捐欵。他們的工作雖則也還幼稚，也還缺乏經驗，然而他們參加一切社會上救亡工作的熱情，却與祖國的小朋友一樣。</p>
<p>不過在文化一向低落的華僑社會裏，一般人都認爲華僑只要出發，救亡工作，也只是出錢，除此以外，其他甚麽工，作都似乎無關緊要，所以在這種環境裏，要推動對僑衆任何一種工作，以至對友邦人士的文化宣傳工作，特別不容易。因爲這些工作本就不爲一般人所注意。雖則有特我們會想至，假如文化工作做得積極一點，是會使捐錢的成績更好，可是一般的社會偏是忽略了它。</p>
<p>說到這裏的敎育情形，也同樣有這樣的缺點。平素不重視敎育的人，根本不會把敎育與當前的抗戰工作聯系起來，而敎育者本身又因爲墨守成規，認爲多一事不如省一事好，在原則上雖然沒有誰敢公然反對抗戰敎育，弄得丈二和尚摸不着頭腦，還不如駕輕就熱，照着老法子，訂課程表二分配工作鐘點，敲鐘，上課，點名，講書，下課，改卷，記分數，算分數，吃飯，睡覺，領修俸，來得簡便。旣不多費心思，又不必多惹閒氣，來得省事。假如你說他是敎死脅，死敎書，敎書死麽？他就讓你說好了。</p>
<p>南洋的文化敎育之所以落後，多半可以說是人事的問題，無法好好解决。</p>
<p>在他們這個學校裏，也同樣感到這種困難。這就是良好師資的缺乏　指導人材的缺乏。同事中雖有不少熱心工作的人，他們雖然抱着滿懷向上的熱情，却因爲不懂得怎樣做，用甚麽方法做，怎樣配合着當前的環境做，結果許多工作都幹不起來。譬如說在僑校裏要實施抗戰敎育的課程，第一沒有適當的課本敎材，第二沒有充分的敎學時間，（這與這裏的中英文並重不合埋的雙重學制有關）第三因人力物力都相當的缺乏，抗戰的敎材不能廣泛的搜集，搜集來後不能作有系統的編定與分配。這裏的生活程度高，印刷工料昂貴，一個力量單薄的學校，要想自已單獨編印課本，自然是辦不到；第四自已沒有充分的把握。要推行抗戰敎育，先得取消了現行的不合理的學制，否則便根本幹不通，要根本改造這裏的敎育制度，必然的會遭受一部份不願改造的人的反對，他們雖然不怕被人目爲異端，或是怕肚子挨餓，可是因爲要推進抗戰敎育而來改造這裏的敎育制度而竟被不願意改革的人拿來做「破壤華僑的團結」或是破壤民族抗日統一戰綫的藉口，那就太寃枉，太不値得。爲避免摩擦與誤解，他們爲這個問題籌思了不知多少時候。這雖然是一般人對抗戰敎育還沒有深切的瞭解，對子過去這裏不合理的學制沒有充分的認識，對改變原有　制的共信，沒有建立，這些或許就是他們過去三年來的工作還做得不够，這裏的情形多少有點像陶行知最近在香港講的「全面抗戰與全面敎育」的講辭中的一節引例：「叫他施行抗戰敎育，他說他以前沒有受過抗戰敎育，叫他讓別人來做呢，他又不願意，」，（大意似乎如此罷，因爲我沒有原文，不能全部記憶起來了。）這多少可以爲這裏的敎育寫照。不過話又說囘來，我並不是說這慶的華僑敎育己經沒有前途，或是完全沒有改造的可能。說來說去，不是主觀力量的問題、人的問題。假如　够好好地把主觀的力量充實了起來，在目前很可以用漸進的方式，在抗戰救亡的大前提之下，用各方而的努力來促進這一運動。</p>
<p>要做到這一點，我們便不能不　切地希望在祖國敎育界的先進與目前正在從事戰區與後方敎育工作教育界同仁。時刻給我們一種有力的援助，與正確的，比較具體的指導，使我們能够開展當前的工作。</p>
<p>過去他們因爲師資的缺乏，指導機婦的不健全，所以三年來他們雖然不斷地的工作，可是工作卻沒有多大的成就。在這裏他們雖會一度試行「小先生」制，終因同學工作幼稚，未易找到工作對象，往往有小先生找不到學生的笑括。同時）因爲受時間的限制，同事同學給日常的事情糾纏着，分不出多餘的時間來倣這工作（其他一切課外的工作都是類此）指導這工作的同事缺點工作興趣，所以弄到「小先生」遇到的困難太多，而大先生竟無去解决，致到工作無法不停頓。俁他們始終認為他們的認識是對的，工作的失敗，幷不是速他們的餒志，同時他們瞭解到這裏的不合理的學制不改善，敎育環境又不好好改造，一切的工作都無法推進。所以他們現在正在集中他們的力量來想法怎樣去改造他們的環境和怎樣去改善這現行的不合理的敎育制度。</p>
<p>爲使僑衆對抗戰敎育有更深切的認識，爲使敎育者本身增加改造我們環境的决心。所以他們曾請求這裏的敎育會和文化界救亡協會兩個團體出來主辦一個夏的華僑敎職員抗戰敎育講座，時間以四人兩月爲限（這裏的暑季是從三去底開始到六月初爲止，首尾兩個月）幷由該　團體聯函恭請陶行知先生來菲講學所指，他們怎樣去開展抗戰敎育工作。相信員一工乍如果能够實現，不但是菲烏華僑教育前途的一綫曙光，而且可以使菲　華僑的抗戰救亡的工作增加一個新生的力量。</p>

<p>【上海通訊】本市外訊：大陸報云，華北實行名義上之廢除中國法幣，與一部份統制出口外匯，至今已一週矣，據華北傳來一切消息觀之，此等辦法，已遇先前性質相同的發展之同等結果，於貨幣方面，禁止法幣顯已失敗，蓋法幣非特並未跌價或絕跡於市，且於本週中用以易北平僞幣，其升水續有增加，其他方面此對華北泰西商業所施的打擊之新辦法，暫已成功，渤海各港口與靑島之歐美出口貿易，暫時已趨停頓，日僞方面甚至不准泰西商行違反新統制制度而履行前經約定之商眾，據路透社大津電訊所稱，可甩此華北新經濟辦法，係由日本軍隊爲後盾，日兵在前德租界入口處搜查中外人士有否携帶法幣，此舉乃蠻橫軍隊之無禮行動，完全侵犯泰西人民所享之條約上權利，領判權不僅應在法律上，且在事實上保護外人之財產，不問日方願否，卽中國去幣亦在外人財產之內，在華計多泰　商人，對其本國當局未在華北向日軍對壨，深致遺憾，彼等大多欲知，為不顧北平愧儡之命令，由泰西軍隊保護，在天津以外輪裝貨出口，並由外國砲艦護送，則將發生何種事故，當然整個事件尚未結束，英國下院封此己發銳利之言辭，並與美國同向東京政府提出正式抗議矣，據日方報組載稱，日方對此等抗議，將不予重視云云，且泰用民治國見其抗議，遭駁斤，必不致默然無言，諒將取某種報復也，但一般均望不直接向華北本身施報復，因此舉必使該地之外國利權受損失，且或將由日方閒接操縱之，故必須向日本直接施報復，華北之新辦法，乃日方實行之，泰西國家必須使日人感覺此等辦法爲魯基莽滅裂而後己，華北之日偽經濟與貨幣立法，卒能成功與否，不獨與泰西國家之態度有關，大半須視華人而　，日軍所控制之華北各城中之華人，並不利用武力之直接方法，惟以不合作繼續作被動之抵抗，而覇使日方之努力失效，如華人方面予以合作，則今日法幣易僞幣，必不致升水，如華人繼續一致緊决不移，則華方銀行業之特特機構，及其換店之衆多，頗可用以繼續摧毀北平偽幣也，友人某甫自華北返滬，一再令記者注意價格問題渠切上聲明，日方鼓動實行　貨幣辦云，顯已忽視價格平準問聽之嚴重性，須知一先令二便士合成幣一元之價格，必須大事減削而後可，質言之，目下北平傀儡銀行　牌之外匯價格，實較所應定者高出百分之六十左右，日人希望將能减低價略平準，但價格絕無成低之象，反在繼續上漲中，其至在北平本身，傀儡當局，雖訂立無數官定價格之　　條例，但不能停止價格之繼續高漲，本週初，西貢米價格在北平躍至平均每包二十五元五角，華北出口物產，亦照幣流通額擴大之比率而價格激增，各種入口貨物之價格亦增，蓋新貨幣辦法使入口受新障碍，並使舶來品短缺益甚也，北平僞銀行宣佈出　外匯，以償付入口貨物，但尚無外商爲私入來往而向其戰買外匯者，僞銀行並訂立所謂具優先權之入口貨物表，先以外匯供給表　各貨，然後辦哩其他貨物之外匯，表內所列，日軍軍用品佔大多數，在此等情况中，華北新辦法實行後之第一週，並未鼓　人心，此舉未能解决經濟與金融大問題，反使此等問題較前更不安定耳。</p>

<h3>政治工作的演變</h3>
<p>— 第四戰區代司令長官　張發奎</p>
<p>與政工人員應具備的條件</p>
<p>—對政治部第五政工大隊訓詞—</p>
<p>責隊因工作上的需要，最近就要分派到前綫去，我預先在這裏祝諸位的健康和努力。今天我所要貢献於你們的意見，也就是我站在代表長官的立場所要期望於各位政訓人員者，希望各位特別注意，並切實履行！</p>
<p>未止式提供意見之前。我想先將過去政工人員在國民革命過程中所發生的作用，有系統地檢討一下，藉以說明政治工作的重要性與政工人員在國民革命中應有的地位與努力。</p>
<p>首先我們嬰問，北伐以前，爲什麽三民主義不能取得廣大民眾的信仰與　護Y國民革命不能得到迅速的推進與成功？爲什麼到了十五年，我們能在很短的期間推翻北洋申伐，完全南北統一？問題之　結，就在民國十三年以前，本部未能以最大之注意，着重于軍隊和民衆政治工作之建立與推行。</p>
<p>總理有鑒於此，特命領袖創辦軍浦軍校，加緊培値軍事政治幹部人才，來負担這一艱巨的任務。民國十五年北伐時，我担任師長，我曾親眼看到政工人員，在軍隊和民衆中，蓬蓬勃勃的活躍情形。在短期內，他們能够把軍隊中那種傳統的軍閥的思想，改變而爲革命的三民主義的思想，把散沙一般的聽天由命的人民，改變而爲有組織有團結的英勇奮鬥的人民；由軍隊相民衆的對立現象，改變而爲軍民親密合作的現象。在這種情形下，所以北伐軍就　長驅直入無往不克。這就是政治工作的一個偉大的成功，同時這一時期，也就是政工人員一個最順利敢有威個的時期。</p>
<p>但不幸自此以後，政治工作被人唾棄，政工人員的地位隨着也一落十丈，政訓處只成了部隊中裝飾門面的點級品，帶兵官不了解政治工作的重要性　，對政工人員採取傲僈或輕蔑的態度，而政工人員也只仰帶兵官的鼻息，不敢說什麽話，甚至輝軍民聯歡大曾都不敢召開，這論對官兵的政治敎育與政洽指導。所以自「八一三」抗戰爆發，一切弱點，就完全暴露出來，因而影響到初期抗戰的軍　上的挫敗。這種單純的軍隊，和政府的抗戰，正是政治工作發弛的具體表現，同時這一時期也就是政工人員最困難校苦悶的時期。</p>
<p>由於最高領袖和陳部長及各戰區軍政長官的注意及此，鑒於初期戰事的困難不是裝備不如人，而是政　動昌的不够，爲使政治與軍事同時並進，爭取最後勝利，中央終於在去年八月一日正式成立政治部，重新建立部隊中及民衆中的政訓工作，同時政工人員的地位與威信，隨着整個政治局勢的改進，也逐漸提高起來，這個時期，是政治工作的復興時期。</p>
<p>戰爭是政治的繼續，特別是中日戰爭中，我們更要注重於政治的動員與改進，以補救我們軍事的不足。所以領袖在衡山會議時，就明白昭示我們：『政治重于軍事」，就是這個原故。</p>
<p>現在各位也要分配到前綫去了，所以我所希望各政工人員的幾個必須的具備條件，想趁此機會，提出來談談。我以爲一個政工人員所必須具備的條件，也和一個軍事工作人員所必須具備的幾個條件，有同等　重要。一個軍專工作人員，一定要會帶兵練兵和用兵，才配做指揮官；而一倜政工人員，也一定要具備他所必須具備的條件　才配做一個政工人員。</p>
<p>什麽是政工人員所必須具備的條件呢？</p>
<p>第一，要有偉大的人格與高尚的道德。這就是說生活要嚴肅，行爲要端正，信仰要决定，重氣節，尚　恥、見義勇爲，臨難不苟，不爲强暴所屈服，不爲利慾所搖動，同時對工作負責任，對戰友重恕道，厚於責己，　於責人，無權利之爭，無門戶之見。這樣才能取得官兵和民衆的信仰，才配做官兵和民眾的表率。</p>
<p>第二，要有刻苦耐勞，勇敢犧牲的精神，就是號召你們，要深入到下層去，要眞正與士與同甘苦，與民衆完至打成一片，脚踏實地的去訓練軍隊，敎育和組織民衆。你們比別人拿更少的待遇。但却要比別人吃更多的苦，做更多的工作，你們不怕困難，不在困難面前屈服，反之，却應以更大的毅力最多的方法去應付困難，克服困難，你們時時刻刻都要站在鬥苦的最前衛，抱定不成功便成仁的决心，絕沒有絲毫的猶豫動搖。只有這樣，才能影響別人，感化別人，推動別人前進。</p>
<p>第三，要有和藹可親的態度，因爲中國士乒和民衆的文化水準都很低，要使他們接受你們的訓練和領導，首先你們就要拿出很誠　的態度去接內他們，帮助他們解除困難，耐心的去推行說服敎育和指導，使得他們覺得你就和他們自己家裏的人一樣的可親，這樣，你的工作才能發生効力。</p>
<p>第四，要能切實遵守並推行政府一切戰時法令這就是說政工人員，定要完全了解政府所頒發的一切戰時法令。例如抗戰建國綱領，徵調壯丁法規，優待抗×軍人家屬條例等，而月要根據政府的戰時法令去進行工作推動工作。因爲我們如果違背了政府的法令，就不免引起磨擦，減削了自己抗×的力量，如果敷衍失責，不切實督促施行，那末所謂動員民衆，也只是一句空話。</p>
<p>第五，要能達到軍事化的要求。因爲政工人員大半都是知識份子生活浪漫，自由主義個人主義的傾向非常濃厚，不過各位都受過軍訓，我想各位大槪都能遵守軍事化的要求做去，但我們這裏所謂軍事化，並不單是服裝的整齊，禮節的講究，而且精神要振作，意志要統一，生活要簡單化，集體化，工作要迅速確寔，這樣才能提高你們工作的效能，適應戰時戰地的需要。</p>
<p>第六，要具有高深的學問，其豐富的經驗，這就是要注重自我訓練的問題，這裏一方面，就要在實際工作中，不斷地學習，形此五相鼓勵，互相檢討，互相批評，另一方面，對于三民主義，總理遺敎，領袖抗戰言論，以及其他各神有價値的書報，就要彼此互相探討，互相研究，互相帮助，這樣來充實你們自己，堅强你們自已。我以爲一個最好的救亡工作者。應該具有各種各樣的技能，他不僅是一個官傳家，而且同時又是一個理論家，組織家與實行家。過去的政工人員，就因爲只尚空談，不務實際，因此就失去了人們的信仰，被人嘲笑爲賣膏藥。現在你們應特別注意自已的修養與鍛鍊，拿出自己的眞本領，眞貨色來給人家看，要使自己的膏藥，不是假膏藥，而是眞當藥，而是眞正能够治病能够發生效驗的膏藥，這樣，人們自然就會信服你們，歡迎你們，敬重你們，一洗過去人們對于政工人員的誣蔑，嘲笑和一切不良的現象。</p>
<p>兄弟對于政洽方面的學職很淺，但趁你們出發之前，把自己過去的一點經驗和見解，向大家說說，希望大家能够本看我這幾站努力去做。相信大家在第二期抗戰中，一定會有更燦爛更輝煌的成就。（救亡社特約）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>改善女工生活</h3>
<p>昨日本港報載女靑年會勞工組，成立以來，努力進行改善女工生活，如設立學校，組織友光團，建立勞工中心區等，對於改善女工的德智體羣及實際生活，可謂已盡其應盡可盡之力了。</p>
<p>下層勤勞同胞生活的困苦，自非本港一地爲然，女工生活之困苦情形，更有非一般中產以上人士所能想象；如何改善女工生活，當然不是簡單的問題，所謂改善亦非澈底辦法；然而假如人人能夠注意這個問題，人人熱心設法改善，則不僅對於女工有所帮助，而對於社會亦必裨益不淺。因此像女靑年會勞工組的工作，應該喚起計會上的注視，我們希望這種改善的工作能够推廣到各界，並且隨時把改善的情形發表出來。同時希望從事於改善工作的人士，用基督救世的犧牲心與穴信心，努力推行，努力勸喻，使各工廠主對於女工的待遇，有所改善，至少要獲得温飽和健康的保證，獲得讀書識字，了解國事，以及參加社團活動的權利。</p>
<h3>祝文恊一週年</h3>
<p>今天是中華全國文藝界協會成立一週年紀念。去年成立大會所在地的武漢，現己陷入×人鐵蹄之下，這是海一個中國文藝工作者所不能無所感應的。但是全國文協是全中國文藝工作者在×人的砲火中在抗戰建國的共同要求卜結合成立的團體，當此抗戰轉入緊急階段，革命成功尚極遼運之際，這個團體及其所有會員的任務，自亦格外艱巨。因此我們不能不期望它進步，不能不期望全國文藝工作者以文協爲中心，鞏固團結，集中力量，爲抗戰建國服務。</p>
<p>文協的留港會員，已於昨日成立香港通訊處，以香港今日文化地位及其對於國內國際文化影響之重大，我們更不能不慶幸其成立，並且不能不祈望它以更大的努力，融洽留港文藝工作者相互間的關係，輸送國際文藝作品，聯絡國際文藝作家，持待過　國內外作家，傳達國內外文藝資料等，以克盡其「文藝交通站」的任務。</p>
<h3>今後英國遠東政策的趨向？</h3>
<p>— 世長譯</p>
<p>一般唯心論的理想家，對於近幾年來英國政策的趨向，深深的覺常錯綜複雜，迷惑不解，英國承認意大利征服阿比西尼亞；英首相張伯倫和希特勒妥協，分割捷克，最近，西班牙佛朗哥政府，也已獲得了英國的承認；這都是使他們不勝震驚的。</p>
<p>遠凍局勢的觀察家，看到中國的英勇抗戰抵製侵略，很表示同情，英國也是同情中國的抗戰的，可是，又若接若離的不敢接觸戰焰，好似尤許日本蹂躪中國的大塊土地，這又將怎樣解　呢？</p>
<p>當物質利益來决定政策的時候，漠不關心的情狀不過是一種表面的蔽遮，責際上仍舊是跟着有利益的方向進行，今後英國遠東政策的發展，是很可以使人感覺震驚的；願意避免這種震驚的人們，尤其是中國的人民，應該切記巴爾美斯頓動爵的格　，英國沒有永遠的理想，它祗知道永久的利益。</p>
<p>英國承認意大利征服阿比西尼亞，因爲它想和莫素里尼商討保障英國的利益，莫索里尼的軍事行動，使英國在蘇丹的鉅大棉業利益。感到威脅；阿比西尼亞的柴納湖是尼羅河水流的來源，也是英國在蘇丹棉業生長和發展的命脈；沒有水就是沒有關花，所以，英國就和莫索里尼安協，承認意大利的侵略行動，因爲，這比在沒有準備的時候，參加戰爭是好得多。</p>
<p>分割捷克的情形，也是一樣的：因爲、如果不是這麼辦，很可能的，英國會捲入一個歐洲的戰爭，但是，英國沒有準備作戰，不能作戰啊！</p>
<p>西班牙問題就比較複雜了，英國固然很希望西班牙成立民主政體，和英國維持友好的關係，但是，自從一九三一年四月西班牙帝制傾覆以來，很明顯的可以知道，西班牙內戰的發生，並不是民主主義和法西斯主義間的衝突，而是法西斯中義和社會革命的鬥爭，英國情願西班牙法西斯化，不願西班牙社會革命成功：因爲，法西斯主義雖然要　壞英國在伊比里半島的利益，可是，社會革命一且成功，那裏的英國利益是完全毀滅了。</p>
<p>英國採取不干涉政策，得到好處的，祗有佛朗哥，一般人士又受到震驚了，民主的英國眞願意援助佛朗哥嗎？是的，這是鐵一般的事實，英首相張伯倫看到佛朗哥快要得到最後勝利的時候，就承認了法西斯新政府，健對佛朗哥有特別的偏愛嗎？不是的，英國一切的行動，都跟隨本身的利益進行，西班牙，無論如何，將成爲隸屬於他人的第三等國家；如果英國不承認佛朗哥政權，希特勒和莫索里尼卽將利用佛期哥，藉復與西班牙的美名，開始建設新的西班牙，而發展它們的勢力，所以，張伯倫之被稱爲現實主義者，並不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>張伯倫的「現實主義」會產生一個遠東的慕尼黑嗎？這問題是很難預測的，有人恐懼英國政府的現實手段，很有重演於遠東的司能，但是，在本年一月十五日，英政府向日本提出牒文。對於日本的「東亞新秩序」計劃，不再保持緘默，同時，更以巨欵貸華，作實質上的援助。</p>
<p>英國曾經嚴厲的譴責意大利侵略阿比西尼亞，甚至於採取經濟裁制的方法，對付意大利：捷克的獨立遭受威脅的時候，首先響應的是英國；佛朗哥空軍轟炸西班牙共和政府未設防的城市，擊沉英國的輪船，英國也曾經一再的提出抗議，日本在中國肆虐，屢次損害英國利益，英國也曾提出多次抗議這種情形很淸楚的在人們的記憶中，目前的問題是，英國對於中國反對侵略的抗戰，能否產生像對付阿比西尼亞，捷克斯洛伐克，和西班牙一樣的情形？英國對於中國的「同情」，和向侵略者的抗議，會轉變爲向侵略者妥協嗎？</p>
<p>據一般的估計，英國在華的投資約値二萬四千萬鎊，比美國的投資額大六倍；英國對華貿易的利益，也是鉅非常大的。英國决定它的遠東政策，是根據於保障這項龐大的利益，並不是基於任何抽象的理想。</p>
<p>目前，張伯倫政府的政策是在援助中國，使中國能够繼續抗戰，抵拒侵略。如果中國向日本投降，英國在華的利益，就受到嚴重的打擊：那時，英國要想恢復它固有的利益，除了向日本作戰以外，沒有其他的方法，倫敦方面估計，中國如能繼續的抗戰下去，日本將到達精疲力盡的時候，而歡迎和平的降臨，英國希望能够提出調停，獲得以可保障英國利益的和乎，這是英國在一月十五日向日本提出牃文；和鉅欵貸華的眞正意義。</p>
<p>英國外　相哈立法克斯勳爵，本月一日在上院表示，英國願意調停中日戰爭，這並不是偶然的、他說：「到達了適當的時機，英政府將毫不猶豫，立刻採取一切必要的步驟，以調停戰爭。」所謂「適當的時機」是指對英國，並不是對中國而言的。</p>
<p>最近的斯洛伐克事件，對於英國在衆的活動，有甚麽影響，很難預料；不過，英國保守黨的領袖們，在攷慮保護英國在華利益的時候，無疑的，又增加了若干焦煩，如果歇洲發生戰事，英國將無暇觀及遠東，而其在東亞的利益，也將大受日本的破壞。</p>
<p>美國的擴軍，和其孤立的失勢，對於英國的政策，也很有影響。美國的活動，對於英國的自治領，加拿大，澳大利亞，新西蘭——至於印度，都有相當的影響，近來，美國正進行建議召開另一華盛頓會議，在白魯塞爾（比利時京澄）或　盛頓舉行，據說中國的領袖們，同意於這種國際會議，但是，中國要想在會議桌上得到勝利，必先在戰場上獲得勝利，這是歷史的敎訓，中國最可靠的朋友是它自己的武器，和人民堅决抗戰的精神，其他的一切是無須計及的。（譯自三月十八日密勒氏評論週報）</p>

<h3>全港文藝界昨熱烈紀念　全國文協一週年</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>並成立留港會員通訊處</p>
<p>正是去年今日的時候，中華全國文藝界協會以嶄新的姿態在武漢成立了。所有的「成見」「派別」「磨擦」……亦在「統一戰綫」的迫切要求之下。像吹散了的風雲，像融化了的春雪一樣。這個空前的大團結，足以說明文化人已經肩起大時代所課予的任務，站上神聖的崗位上，來發揮筆背的偉大作用了。</p>
<p>雖樂守，全國文協歸伴着新都的工作却來得更加積極；各地的分社或通訊處亦　抗戰現勢的發展而益加廣泛地開展，昨天，文協留港會員和本港文藝界，為慶祝全國文協總會週年紀念，特地舉行一個　前的集會，同時成立留港會員通訊處，不消設為是配合着客觀環境的電費前寓　深遂　義的一員光榮的歷史紀錄。</p>
<p>昨天下午二時，正是陰過後的一個富有春意的晴天。梁恭綽，許地山，馬鑑，費穆，陳衡哲，葉靈鳳，劉思慕，馬國亮……諸先生都到會了。許世英，簡又文，歐陽予倩，蔡楚生，司徒慧敏諸先生雖因　阻未克參加，亦有派代表出席。羣賢畢至，精誠携乎，文人在香港這是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>雖然是爲了出席人數太多，主席亦沒有工夫介紹，可是，大家却悄悄地翻閱簽到簿，私自竊竊地談着，這個是誰，那個是誰。</p>
<p>開會結束了三五成組的寒喧與話舊。默念之後，就是許地山先生致詞。許先生的熱誠，是在　同仁所深深感佩的。</p>
<p>接着，就是主席團葉恭綽先生以長者的風度，從從容容地發揮了一番高論。而以「生的文學來代替死的文學」，以「動的文學來代替靜的文學」，勗勉大家配合着時代的需要好好地苦幹。</p>
<p>樓適夷先生在司儀員喊到「報吿籌備經過」的時候，就用他頗有上　味的普通話報吿本港文協通訊處籌備的經過，並附帶報吿總會一年來在前綫，在後方的工作動態。文人亦是鬥士；筆桿與槍桿同樣重要，赤裸裸的事實，已經給我們一個具體的說明了，最末，他還說：會場的形式雖然沒有貼標語，亦沒有國旗與總理遺像，但是我們所記住的祖國，與今後要實踐的工作，却深深地刻在我們每個人的腦海間。</p>
<p>主席團報吿重慶總會來電之後，就是汪大燧代表許世英氏演講。接着許地山先生把陳衡哲女十邀上講台來，格外引起全場的注意。嘗經「救救中學生」在北平的「獨立評論」久仰過的陳先生　她原來在黑長抱上還鑲着「古色古杳」的大花邊，頗有點兒特別。她在批評抗戰文學，與非抗戰文學之後，亦提出文學應該眞實性的主張。</p>
<p>劉思慕先生說：香港文藝界的進步是可喜的現象。今後要善用我們的筆桿和漢奸及失敗主義者的投降理論鬥爭。希望本會成立後：（一）提高抗戰文學的水準；（二）文　工作要切　聯糸；（三）在香港這個交通中心要與中外文化界互相聯絡，互相介紹。</p>
<p>因爲時間的關係，演講的節目就翻過去了。通過宣言與祝總會代電之後就是討論提案了。</p>
<p>先是討論幹事會的組織，化了很多時間，結果給一位會友提議具體辦法交新理事會辦理，來得乾霾。關於舉行會報案；組織文藝交通站擴大國際宣傳案：舉行文藝晚會案與定期召開對外的文藝晚會案；都有詳細的商妥。</p>
<p>討論完畢，應有的文章就是選舉。結果中選爲幹事的是；許地山，歐陽予倩，樓適夷，蔡楚生，戴望舒，葉軍鳳，陳衡哲，劉思慕。陸　林等九位。候補幹事是吳景崧，簡又文二位。我們對于新理事，不消說是寄托着無限的熱望呢。</p>
<p>最末，主席團請大家喝「茶」却沒有「點」，這個倒亦饒有意趣。爲抗戰而降低生活是應該的；在現社會，被剝削的精神勞動者亦配不上亨受。淸苦的文人，喝一杯淸茶，是耐人尋味啊！</p>
<p>成立會結束了，願穴家親密地携手，在文藝統一戰綫底下使呼籲多時的工作從此一課一課翻下去，一直到香港結着新文化的花果，我們得能打回復興了的祖國和伙伴們見面。</p>

<h3>流浪街頭的小報販　棲息在寒風苦雨下討生活</h3>
<p>離天亮還有這許多晨光，嬌生慣養的少爺小姐們，這時節，雖則也會從夢中醒轉來，但是不一會兒，望見窗外還是一片黑，寒風在外面拚命的想從窗縫裏鑽進來，便意識到應該再尋一回好夢，更往被窩的深處鑽，不一囘便又呼呼地睡着了。然而，這時候時間約莫是淸晨四時，茶居剛剛開門營業，淸脆的賣報的叫聲，却已斷斷續續地打進我們的耳鼓裏了！不錯，假使你對這兒的物事幷不熟習的話，跟着淸脆的叫聲望過去，看見了一羣賣報的孩子——年紀最大的不過十四五歲，最小的僅僅七八歲——他們的出現，是會引起你底驚詫的：還沒有到做事的年齡，運麼早，這麼冷，啊，可憐的孩子們！</p>
<p>從早上四點鐘起，到九點多十點的幾個鐘頭裏面，便是這一羣孩子兜賣早報的緊張時節。下午兩點至六點之間，得替晚報找顧客。六時以後，依然沒得淸閒，却仍要把剩下的早報和晚報，幾份書在一起，幹貶値傾銷的工作，要到丸時以後，才有休息的機會。</p>
<p>從早上四點到下午六點，這些小孩子的足跡遍佈於香港的每一個角落，因爲報館通通集中在中區，所以，淸晨兩點鐘左右，他們便從香港的每一個角落跑到中區，耐心地等候着報紙的出版，才不不怕早市錯過了。寒風不會憐惜這些可憐的孩子，在冷靜的街道上，一樣虎虎地而着，於是，賣報孩子趕着跑發出來的喘息，全給虎虎的風聲掩蓋着，聽不見了。跑啊，跑啊，他們急促地趕着路！</p>
<p>雖則在寒風的包圍裏，殘破的衣裳包裹着的身體，仍然有汗的味息，路途遙遠，跑得執了起來，也許會把那件不稱身的大　，——祗是那麽一件破舊的西衣——除了下來，仍然續權向目的地跑過去。他們是三五成羣的，雖則沒有什麽正式的聯絡，他們却都是怪親熟的伙伴。在途中，斷斷續續地搭訕着，談論着昨天的營業，得意的時候，也會高聲的笑起來，衝破靜悄悄的冰一般的淸晨的沉寂，到了報紙發行的中心地點，若還早了點兒的話，便臥在地上躺一會，年紀較大的，便會利用這空暇賭一囘，把買報的本錢都輸完了，也不是罕有的一囘事。</p>
<p>由早上四點到七點，他們四處去兜賣是比較自由點兒的，這時節，他們不會突然給警察抓着，帶到警署去，也不必提防那些沒有眼睛的車輛，而且，顧客也比較其他時間的來得多，來得有秩序。</p>
<p>近來香港常常會有新的報紙出現，發刊的頭幾大，發行的價錢是非常便宜的，碰到這樣的機會，賣報的孩子們是格外興奮的。他們會用種種熟練的方法，引起一般人對這一份新刊物的興趣，因爲成本低廉，他們的收入也就跟着多了好些，至於普通的舊有的報紙，他們也有百份之三十至四十的利益可圖，不過，賣報孩子的數目，一日比一日的多起來，所以，他們每日所得，實在是微手其微的，雖然是這麽困苦，也還得繼續幹下去，否期，連這蠅頭之利也弄不到手，那才糟糕啊！</p>
<p>如果我們從街頭溜過，就常常可以看見他們給晉察抓住了，淚痕滿臉苦苦的哀求把他釋放的情景，總曾令你心酸而且憤恨的。這些可憐的孩子們，給生活的驅使，不管虎虎的寒風，淋漓的大雨，炙人的烈日，始終不懈地做他們所能做的工作，假若他們應該遵守法律，那麼，社會就應該負責讓他們有遵守法律的機會，從然把他們送到警署去，加以「懲戒」，是不會獲得澈底解决的！</p>
<p>上面說過，他們的年紀是介乎七歲與十五歲之間，所以他們都是已經上了學齡的孩子，社會不也應該負責給他們以敎育的機會嗎？　（新）</p>

<h3>西江×陷泥淖中　已無進犯能力　建築防禦工事只圖保守　勒令鄉民遷居建築砲臺</h3>
<p>【肇慶特訊】西江×軍自更換指揮官以來、將屆一月、屢次揚言進攻、而終未敢越雷池一步，是以其實無進犯能力、泥沼深陷、莫由自拔也、茲將最近×情分誌如次、</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>五花八門的明星宣傳手段</h3>
<p>却爾斯鮑育說過、「演員們都是反常的人、假如我們是正常的人、我們早就不做演員了」、</p>
<p>演員們確是和常人有很多不同之點、爲了宣傳工作上的便利、他們往往親身故意做出點奇特的事來、以顯出他們特異的性格、不如此、他們很難找出宣傳資料、而要維持聲名不　、宣傳之得力與否確是一個很大的關鍵……請看，好萊塢最美的女于，最漂亮的男子並不是著名的影星、却都是臨時演員、正因爲他或她得不到一個宣傳的機會、只要有人爲他取她宣傳、是不難踏上明星寶座的、</p>
<p>希迪拉瑪初到好萊塢時、正和現在一樣地有她動人的特性、然而她却被遺忘了好幾個月、直到報紙上開始爲她宣傳的時候、才漸　頭角而升高至今日的地位、</p>
<p>雖則、每一個演員的成功史上、决不以他的成功歸諸宣傳之力、然而我們却都知道、宣傳工作之於一個電影的演員、正如空氣之對於一個人、是一日不可缺的、否則—也許他們承認這是事實—他們决不會常常做出那些特別的事情出來了，</p>
<p>舉個例來說、九月中瑪莎蕾在舊金山表示她將在十裏和大銜斯結婚了、同時她說、他們將正正式式的舉行一個婚禮、然而並不需要盛大的一個、她附　上一句：「我不需宣傳、我祗要結婚而己」、</p>
<p>爲了實踐她的話、她不在好萊塢結婚而任恩森那達、在那裏以寧靜一點、人們都相信她是眞正的逃避宣傳工作，祗是很少人知道有一事……、</p>
<p>她出走的前一天、派拉蒙的攝影場內佈置了一個墨西哥式的佈景、新夫婦由門外邊子挽手的緩步而入、臉上帶着新婚的微笑、同時攝影機響了起來、一一收入鏡頭內、這祗是一個預演、然而宣傳目的却已經達到、放映起來確可引人注意呢、</p>
<p>普通男女私自逃出結婚、總是越秘密越好、在這兒却週得其反、　肆招搖、惟恐人之不知，的確、像這樣的秘密結婚在宣傳功效上比堂堂皇皇舉行婚禮要大得多、</p>
<p>亨利威爾考克辛和瓊胡特白　似乎不明白這一點、全副禮服在禮拜堂中當着親戚朋友的面舉行婚禮、他們的婚事、在第二天的報紙上很可憐的只佔了一行地位、假如他們明白一點、趕到猶馬去結婚、一定不致這樣慘法、試看賈克奧凱和文尼泰凡登結婚時、却在猶馬大車祗停十五分鐘的短時閒內宣誓成立、這個却獲得了絕大的宣傳効果、同時它又暗暗的代賈克的新片子Florlda　Limited作了部份的廣吿、在這片中、是有火車作背景的、</p>
<p>勞萊也是够古怪的了、一年到頭忙着請客、不是和他妻子伊麗安娜脫離、便是又和好如初、高魄起來、或許還再來一次婚　、他們已經結過三次婚、最後一次、勞萊說出了一句不朽的驚句、「這也是請客的一個好藉口呢、」</p>
<p>某次伊麗安娜犯了駛車章程，拘留了九小時、　影記者非但拍攝了她出來後和勞萊擁吻的照片、也拍下了當時焦急的文夫坐在監牢門前的石級上張着大眼等妻子的情形、</p>
<p>報紙對他倆合而又分、分而又合的事毫不容情的揭戰出來、這却正中下懷、滑稽的勞萊獲得了有趣的宣傳効果、</p>
<p>據卡洛朗白說、她一九三七年年入共四十六萬五千元、然而實際可得的不過二萬元、所得稅就要二十九萬七千五百七十五元、佔去了一大半、最近有人詢問她對所得稅的感想時、她抱怨麽、不、她慷慨激昂的發表了一大篇言論，說的是、</p>
<p>「二萬元已經狠够了、把我收入的大部份貢獻給政府、是很好的事、我一年决計用不羞四十六萬五千元這筆大欵子、爲什麽不把我甩不着的錢貢献給政府呢、這是用掉它的最正當辦法了，而且假如沒有如此巨額的所得稅、或許我的收入也不會有如此之多、薪水是跟着所得稅而走的、而假如所得稅根本沒有、發或者我一年還沒有二萬元可得呢、』</p>
<p>這篇話漂亮極了不是、可是據別人的估計、她所說的稅額未免稍微誇張了一點、然而是什麽使她說上這些話的呢、很容易的、這些話可以使人聯想到她的新片、</p>
<p>宣傳並不能鼓勵女星生孩子、可是她能利用她、像桃樂賽拉摩罷、她的律師正正式式的通知公司方面、在她二十西歲生日的時候，她將自影界引退一年、以便生產一个孩子出來、這句話擾動了不少人的聽聞、有人勸她領一個孩子就算了、她囘答、</p>
<p>「我要一个我自己的孩子、不是別人的、我覺得每个結婚女子都應該有一个自己的孩子、這是一種責任，而我希望在我二十五歲生辰之前就能有一个、這樣、當我的孩子長大的時候，我還能是很年輕的、」</p>
<p>她二十四歲的誕辰在去年十二月十日已過去了、她還是在派拉家忙着拍片、她的宣傳人應該是个很聰明很聰明的人、</p>
<p>瑪琳黛德麗在前幾年是號稱爲具有好萊場最美的極的、然而她那時候偏　着男裝穿長十褲、把一　深藏起來、後來不知在什麽時候、她又放棄了它、長褲子現在不冉是她的標記了、只有那些體態不甚健美的人才應當穿它、現在的　德麗似乎在提醒影迷們不要忘記、她的腿仍然是够健美的呢，</p>
<p>琴哈羅死後，威廉鮑戚爾傷感不已、他集了一　款子、專爲獻花在她的墓上、這個多情的舉動感動了許多人、……近日另一故事傳出、安特拉李茲也每日送花到死去不久的賈克　—宋雅海尼的當溜冰搭擋—　上去、這個故事顯然差了一點、假如她不在他死前就離開好幾月，而現時不在夜總會裏和男朋友大樂的活、這故事豈不更像眞一點嗎、</p>
<p>喬治賴甫說的「宣傳史」是最丰富的一個、初入影界時，他自稱爲曾敎過當時威爾斯太子的探戈舞後來太」登位而成愛德華八世了、這　宣傳得更有了勁、愛德華八世退了位後、喬治曾請他前來好萊塢、來不來是另一問題，像去年喬治又曾請一位孩子—他的母親因謀殺案被　死刑了—到他家來度聖誕節—結果那男孩沒有來、可是過有什麼關係呢、反正喬治在報紙上已出够風頭的了、</p>
<p>埃洛弗林說的話有點像「揑了鼻頭做夢」似的、他初來好萊塢、舌　花的大談其過去的歷險史、把許多人都朦住了、過了一陣子肚子也淘空了、改變方向、又談起將來探險的計割來、假如你完全相信他的話、你就是個大傻子、</p>
<p>對於女星半裸和窄小的衣服仍然是最妙的宣傳方法、前一種衣服，目下　洛朗白、梅兒奧白朗、安秀　登三人各各出奇鬥勝的競爭着、而後一種呢、看了瑙瑪希拉的早年影片後、便知無疑的她是占着首席的了、</p>
<p>連好萊塢一向認爲最幽　的　　薇哈佛蘭，也在用半裸的裝束作宣傳呢、</p>

<h3>近萬球迷看大戰　華聯榮獲麗華杯　四比二殺敗西人文員聯隊</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天放請，球迷們皆大歡喜、甫至下午三時、巳見那香港會球場、賓如歸至、「生意興隆」、總會的球老　、心花怒放、暗地裏感激天公造美、但未知會不會感激那百份九上九的華人顧客、不惜破　、集流成沼、乃得　筆巨大的溢利、</p>
<p>二千九百零三塊錢的門票收入、雖不是本季內的最高紀錄、然而香港足球運動已「恢稪繁榮」、則是事實、</p>
<p>我想、國家多難、匹夫有責、我們「避入桃源」、切勿忘記祖國、周　臣爵紳曾說過、在香港勸銷一千萬元救國公　、至今還未足額、這原因何在呢、若果購買公債的人像得參觀足球比賽那麽踴躍、信得過成績必佳、</p>
<p>閒詁少題、言歸正傳、却說這件足球大事，乃係麗華杯决賽、勝則得標關係重大、故而、面熱鬧、顚倒衆生、假使此回决賽沒有華人聯隊競爭於其間、又沒有「東方標準球人一李惠堂登場、定不致如此「叫座」、歟盛哉、香港足球、</p>

<p>看看上列兩陣、誰强誰弱、目了然、故華聯得勝而榮　錦標、是應該的、但我們殊料不到人馬更動極大的西員、頗多佳作、却使看客篇奇、</p>
<p>昨天我曾說過、「柏架打內衛、最爲狡憎、常會出擊而令對方前鋒越位、故惠堂從中進取、須提防柏架所設的陷阱、「果然的柏架又施此計、雖經驗豐富如惠堂、仍不免有幾次入其圈套、而素慣越位的侯澄滔、更不在話下、</p>
<p>柏架的位置戰、確够路數、和他合柏的布力般、亦是斲輪老手、故雙雙演出、具見功夫，西員不致多負、多賴此兩人之力、夏仙釘住惠堂、亦步亦趨、可謂盡責、然而惠堂仍能獨力深入而側射、得勝第四球、錦上添花、勝局乃趨於穩定、可見惠堂確有登峯造極的本領、爲任何人看他不牢的、不過、他在昨天的演出、尚未得謂爲盡最、蓋因塲面濕滑、泥濘滿地、他奔跑起來、每感立足不穩、找尋出路、殊非容易、而其他各員、亦常有一行不得也哥哥「之嘆、</p>
<p>洋人魄力，平均勝於我們、况且一個球警局面、進攻方面必較防守方面來得吃力，昨戰華聯常處進攻的　位、諸鋒當然以求完成最後一脚爲目的二惟場滑球重、進展很難、西員守將則憑險抵抗、易收　擊之效，他們又够魄力、在滑　作戰、更佔便宜、所以華聯雖常取攻勢、祗因素所擅長的三角短傳衛、運用時不如意、遂覺獲勝不易、然而華聯終以藝高一籌、雖大時地勢皆不利、惟得人和、各憑純熟功夫、克服困　、卒吿勝利、奪得錦標　、</p>
<p>西員前軟後硬、顯然一個畸形局面、故在此種情形下、他們員求不致多失球、便爲幸事、若欲取勝、非意外則無可能、故能够支持得失球不致相差太　、就是他們的成功了、</p>
<p>華聯　綫的錐形突擊，昨戰沒法得逞，惟兩翼側擊則收大效、故內　與外翼之間、常見活動、</p>
<p>前衛綫的梁榮照、掩護前綫進展最得力、曾仲云與許竟成、亦多佳作、惟竟成的供球術、尚欠度數，最好再多練用右脚、或可彌補此種缺點、李天生侯容生兩內衛、因前　拱護有方、乃　游刃有餘、譚均幹所失第二球、頗爲笑話、殆或球　滑且重、以致失手嗎、故伜聯雖然得標、功罪尚須分明、此亦春秋責　賢者的意思、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>（八分鐘）四員各　奮勇非常、前樸後繼、向我陣地進犯、李安納居中接應、妙傳地派各、卽抄入腹地、舉足施射、均幹飛身撲救、球兒脫穎而出、均幹未及翻身、衣史杜蘭治適伏兵門前、順水推舟、先破一關（一比C）、</p>
<p>（十三分鐘）華聯進襲甚烈，景祥兆榮、先後叩關、可惜彈落野外、無功而囘、</p>
<p>（廿一分鐘）西員五路急攻、「石　仔一容生兇猛異常、驅逐不速之客、兆榮得其接濟、轉遞景祥、「神腿」運球右路、廣森含枚疾　、妙脚切中、「小猴」澄滔箭似的抄進城池、舉足一拖、布力般遲來生步、高路士欲救無從、球遂人網、（一比一）打成平手、</p>
<p>（廿七分鐘）惠堂在敵陣射門、柏架擋出界外、廣森開角球、爲澄滔所獲、祇以門　閉塞、無機叩射、急遞竟成、竟成復交榮照、是時文員守衛、注意華聯　鋒、却不料榮照有遠射之舉、毒箭放來、直中紅心、以（二比一）佔先、</p>

<p>此賽過程、除廣大梁杰富首開紀錄、之先入一球外嗣後樂方均佔上風、徐享，念華、黃鼎芬先後中籃，造成十與七之比數，及至梁杰、富梁江強、盧働、互相破關、始迫成十比十、十九比一十四之局面、嗣後、雙方爭　頗烈、迨至上半場吿終、東方僅以廿四比十九佔先、易地再戰、實大後防吿急、徐亨籃　乘隊偷襲、遂成卅二與廿三之比數、迨至　宜昭四犯出場、廣大防綫更形空虛、東方先後以四十一比卅五、及五十七比卅七、將廣大整個陣綫擊破後、廣大雖經梁鄭盧二鋒、　間射籃、但東方　徐亦還以顏色、但至全場結戰、東方遂以七十三比四十四大勝、末塲乙組華僑對紅　兩隊、實力懸殊、勝敗之數、不待　卜、戰釆逐成一面倒、結果華僑以七十比十六大勝、</p>

<h3>律二有應眾觀球看</h3>
<p>— 羅夏</p>
<p>桑載克博士是個　代敎育學家。他自發明了「　　律」以後，許多人都利用這　習三定律來推演很多定理　　各項事情。結果應用這種方法的都得着相當的成功。現在我這學習三律來說說看球三律。　大家知道應該　着那一種心情來去看各項球類比賽。</p>
<p>（一）準備律（Low　of　redioess）—每當一球賽未開賽之前、我們心目中應該有一種準備來去欣賞這次球賽、是說、我們看這次賽球不是『凑熱　」或者是當「消遣」而來、是抱着一種研究和測驗自己的觀察力　批評力的心情而來、首先要想想、這次比賽、那一隊會得勝呢、那一隊會失敗呢、勝與敗相差成績的比數又如何呢、自己當前應該有一　準備來預測、其次要想想、每個球員這次的演出成功還是失敗呢、整個隊的傳射和聯絡優良是低劣、自己也應該有一個觀察與批評、這就是在未開賽前應有的準備律、</p>
<p>（二）練習律或稱用與不用律（Law　of　ereadre　or　law　of　use　and　disus）天演公例來說一「　用則　於成功不用則變成　退」卽是說、我們練習多看球賽、就增加自己多一點觀察力　批評力、反之、少看球賽、或者有不會看球賽的觀眾、會誤會裁判員的判評錯誤、或者錯看球員有不法行動、因而開成了許多因觀衆而發生爭執與糾紛、這個問題、在本港常常會發現得到、這大　份都是未明　常看球本旨、所以第二個　習定律就是說我們不只是去看球賽、　　該要多練習去看球賽、那才眞正得着正確的認識與批評、</p>
<p>（三）效果律或稱滿足與煩惱律（Law　of　effect　or　lawhf　satisfac　ion　and　annoyance）們看完了這場球賽、你自己的感覺如何、滿意呢還是感覺煩惱呢，假如你是覺得滿意的話、那是你自己以後就常常會云看賽球、即如一個小孩子因哭而得糖、那他以後就常哭、國爲會得着　、那就成了一種習慣、有習慣就滿意了、反之、他得不着惦、就不會哭、他就會煩惱了、所以第三個效果定律、是最要緊的、我們需要看好的球隊演出、好的技術　演、好的體育道德收　、那才產生了良好的效果、才不這效果律的眞旨、</p>
<h3>早操效能（四）</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>有維持健康增</p>
<p>加壽命的效能</p>
<p>在過去的舊社會裏一般老年人、都以爲體育、屬于嬉戲、是靑年人的事業、甚至靑年人也不去幹還是好的、如成長的人去幹、史不雅觀了、由那裏看出來呢、大家常常也可以看到的、老年人每見成年的人、無論跳、跑、　……或和兒童遊玩時，必會實寫的說、「你還是年輕嗎、太不生性啦一、由這點都可以知道、他對于體育太輕視、或太不明瞭、而不知道、體育的訓練、很多地方是和他們老年人有關係的「早操」就是其中最重要的一種、「延年益壽一的慾望、我相信每一個人都是有的、秦始皇之求神仙、千辛萬苦、不知費盡了多少金錢，和費了多少民力，至死不矢　　、這是他愚昧的行爲、定是爲我　法，祇可以爲我們的警戒、我老實的對大家說、求長生必無術、不老可有方、普通人所謂「鶴髮童年一就是我所謂「不老」的意思、係就大家的「健康」和「精神」來講、比如、你今年的年齡、雖是六七十歲、但你的健康精神都像三四十歲的一樣、或茶至三四十歲的人也不若、這就是我所說的「不老」、求這種的不老、我敢說有保用的單方、這個單方是秘傳的嗎、不、是公開的、現在正要向大家公開、祗要大家耐的、有恆的、不斷的去實行吧、究竟是什麼單方呢、我前面己說過的、就是一「早操」、大家實行早操了、都可以得到健康的保持、和壽命的增加、所以我們要達到「延年益　一的慾望的話、必要每天淸晨、能够切實的地的去實行「早操」、（八）有增加生產的效能</p>
<p>生產的多寡、必不在作工時間的過多、而在適當的時間內、與作工之精神、已有前人的證明、至于精神從何而來呢、故然是來自强健身體、也必要有相當的休息與培養、其所謂培養者，卽一方面減輕其疲勞、一方面提高其興奮作用、由這看來、生產的根本能力、就是健全的軀體、和興奮的幹事精神，先有健全的軀體等、才有　富的生產能力、生產的能力强、生產才會增加、「早操」旣有保持健康之效能、人可以恢復疲勞等、間接的、當然也可以有增加生產的效能、</p>
<p>同胞們、大家都以爲在此國難的當中、應養育健兒、爲國家復興而効力的、勿以我此爲空談、而每大應實地的把兒童體育訓練的担子、重新的負在肩上、更能目勉勉人、以挽　弱、這是　家的大幸、　（完）</p>

<h3>從雨傘說起</h3>
<p>— 李丹</p>
<p>一連幾天的陰雨，街頭浮動着一團團的雨傘，悠閒的足步便在雨傘底下移動着。</p>
<p>雨傘，是本地比較流行的東西。相傳這風氣是從多雨多霧的英京傳來的，因爲倫敦的人士喜歡拿雨傘，所以全英國的人喜歡拿雨傘，所以本地的英人一樣喜歡拿雨傘，所以本地的華人也一樣喜歡拿雨傘，這個理由大槪還算充足的吧。</p>
<p>英國人的甚歡　雨傘，正如他們喜歡養狗一樣，眞是朝野皆然，自天子以至庶人一樣的。其中尤以張伯倫的喜歡拿雨傘最爲著名，從雜誌上的照片以至報紙上的漫畫，我們都可以看得到張伯倫與雨傘的形影不離，雖不能說凡有雨傘的地方就有張伯倫。但是凡有張伯倫的地方一定有雨傘，這是事實，因此我們一見到雨傘就想到張伯倫，一想到張伯倫就不會忘記雨傘。</p>
<p>雨傘是防雨的工具，在多雨之天，一個人能够躲在雨傘底下，雖然是瑟縮的，幽暗的，但至少是一件暫時幸運的事。在滿城風雨的歐洲今日，張伯倫的手不離傘子，也自有他的道理。</p>
<p>當德意成立了法西斯的軸心，而希特勒的劊子手戈林將軍發表了一篇『爆彈演說』，大意是：列强加有阻止德國企圖時，德國不辭立刻動員與之决一死戰。這篇演說一傳出，整个歐洲便籠罩在狂風暴雨的氛圍中。</p>
<p>正如這幾天陰雨中的香港居民一樣，他肩着傘子跑了來，又跑過去。</p>
<p>然而，在那瑟縮的幽暗的傘下生活裏。他自己雖不曾淋漓濕透，他却看着別人成了落湯的鷄。他眼望着奧國併入德意志的版圍，他眼望着捷克成了和平的祭品。那狹窄的傘底下，除了　庇自己一個人以外，是沒有餘地遮蔽別人的。但是，狂風暴雨似乎是愈來愈兇，一把柔弱的傘子能否　此重任，已成問題，雖則是僅僅用來遮蔽一個人。</p>
<p>這年頭可不是頑要的時候了，那連天的風雨，它不僅震撼了歐洲，而且很早就瘋狂地，摧殘着我們的國土，許多背年已經是撇下他們的雨傘，鋼盔換了傘蓬，刺刀代替了傘柄，他們冒着暴虜的風雨，挺起胸膛向前勇進，直至和麗的晴天　新温暖我們的大地——靑天白日滿地紅。</p>
<h3>關於小托爾斯泰　保斯陀夫斯基友</h3>
<p>— 秋譯</p>
<p>除了是一個新世紀中最偉大的文學家之外，A托爾斯泰是普希金。果戈里，契柯夫，高爾基遺下的光榮傳統的承繼者。</p>
<p>在閱讀他的作品時的第一個印　——和有力的銳敏的才能相　觸的感印——　無可泯滅的。它立卽會牢牢地把握住人們的想像。</p>
<p>A托爾斯泰有着銳敏的眼睛，尖利的耳朶，活潑過人的語言，有着對人民稀有的了解。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰顯示了一個廣大的世界、一個充滿了彩色，新鮮和理想的世界，一個屬于許多時代的人的世界，由彼得大帝起到社會主義時代止。在極豐富的人物中使我們大開眼界——　常常是活生生的，常常是觸動我們的心弦的，常常是鼓舞着我們的感情，喚起了歡笑和愉悅，憂愁和憤慨。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰的寫作事業是完整多　，有着全然的特徵。這事業，是一個活的銳敏的內心，和那成功，無畏，堅决的努力而找尋得來的最隹的表現方法相配合；有時却有了不可避免的錯誤，一個大才者的錯誤，因以稍損了勝利的光華，這是爲民衆的偉大的文學事業，光榮而艱鉅。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰的寫作範圍是那麽博大，他運用他的筆是那麽豐饒，好像什麽也沒有遺漏。作家能觸到如許廣博的題材，而又能如許完善的很少。他的作品包括着歷史（「彼得大帝」，「彼得的日子」，「愛——　的書」），想像的（「亞蓮它」，「工程師格達的雙曲線體」），內戰（「到卡爾維里之路」，「懦夫」，「尼夫蘇魯夫的胃險」），兒童故事（「布拉脫奧」），有力的嚴嚴的關于沙皇黨的抵抗的故事（「榖粒」），痛苦的自我犧牲的俄羅斯婦人的厄運（「馬絲亞，」「老菩提樹下」），西方故事（「古代之路」，「黑金」），以及其他無數有趣的故事，彌漫着麥田，花園，和深的河流的氣氛。</p>
<p>博學家，在一定的範圍內，常要成爲詩人的，他們有了銳敏的情感，這情感是靠了他們的理想的勇敢，他們的思維，發見了的。科學的定律時常因了對互相分離與無連繫的事物的强力的創造的想像力推演出來，這想像力，成功了科學家和文學家。而且——深人地看察，兩者之間有着很大的共通之點例如，發見了偉大的天體定律的黑庶尼，和創作了「浮士德」的歌德有着一樣創造的想像力。</p>
<p>真正的科學家，文學家是血族的兄弟。把人生美顯示在科學，藝術，他們對於兩者都有良好的知識。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰的語言是很明白和接近民衆，充滿了簡明之力和深長的意味。在今天怕沒有另一位作家對俄國語言能如托爾斯泰具有如許有機的感覺了，他運用他的語言，其自與然輕易，正和民衆用他的手指和聲音一樣。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰學習語言是從最純粹最豐富的源泉——從普通民衆學習。</p>
<p>因此，他愛好民間藝術和民間傳統，因此他最近從事於搜集蘇聯民閒傳說的工作，這是具有眞正科學價値的。</p>
<h3>懷德之戰</h3>
<p>— 杜文意</p>
<p>——紀一個夜襲皇軍的故事——</p>
<p>夜來了。繁星在黑暗中　着眼。在這濃密的荔枝園喜更顯得深沉和靜默。是我們出動的時候了。弟兄們們正在捲起他們的被鋪放進一個掘得很深的地洞裏。大家重新圍成一個小圓圈。莊嚴的死寂的氣氛籠罩着四週，閃耀在每個弟兄底黧黑的臉上。我們在這十幾天的黑夜戰鬬中，已使我們不用燈光都可以辨別一切的事物，况且這裏還是我們生長的故鄉呢。雖然每個人的身體已很消瘦，可是經過這一天來的休息，我們已復原了。尤其是今天的出擊是爲着我們的彈藥糧食已快斷絕的緣故，因此每個人都顯得有點興奮爽朗的樣子。</p>
<p>陳中隊長是這游擊支隊的領袖，他是自衛團的中隊長，從前曾當過營畏。曾在江西邊境剿過共產黨，經過很多大小的內戰，在作戰方面是頗有經騐的，雖然他的年紀已快近五十，可是他的體格還是年靑人那樣壯健的，他平生都是一個見義勇爲的脚色，所以，這次敵人。進東莞城以後，他就領導着一個中隊的弟兄，和敵人作戰，直至他們的隊伍死剩這三十二人然後忍痛地退却到鄉村去補充。可是人們都跑淸了。一切東西都給敵人搜括蹂躪殆盡。不過陳中隊長的意志是這樣堅决，他把他的精神鼓舞着這支隊，他不願遠離這家園，於是他就領導着這支隊活躍於莞太公路附近村莊了。</p>
<p>他嚴肅地站起來說：『各位弟兄！你們的精神已很舒服了吧！』同志們都興奮地說：『是的，陳隊長。』</p>
<p>他又繼續下去。「我相信各位都明白今晚我們出擊的任務。我們的彈藥快完了！我們的糧食快完了！我們的接濟就全靠我們能否戰勝敵人！能否奪取到敵人的子彈和糧食。……今日我得到一個報吿就是敵人現在祗有一小隊人駐在懷德鄉，並且有很多糧食和子彈。我們已經有了該鄕的鄕長做內應，當我們一看見鄕公所上的油燈閃動時，你們就分三路進攻，×軍是駐紮在黃家祠裏，我們分幾路小組由小路躱進附近民房，先殺死他的哨乒——』</p>
<p>我們這支隊開始在黑暗的荔枝園裏開動。沒有一點人聲，只有樹葉擦在鎗枝和身體上發出一陣沙沙的聲音。跑出荔枝園，過幾個崎嶇的山坡。落到莞太公路上，我們在路邊　着身子走着。夜空的繁星像鬼靈似的不斷着映眼，彷彿是歡迎我們這支黑夜的行列。</p>
<p>走了半個鐘頭，我們已到達懷德了。在黑暗中際約見到無數黑越越的舊房子的陰影給一帶果林圍繞着。我們分開了三個小隊，由那果圍傍邊的每條小路跪進村莊　。我們靜悄悄地爬上一些荔枝樹上和躱進一些無人的荒屋的天台裏。</p>
<p>村莊裏是死寂的。經過×軍進駐以後，被強姦屠殺而死的屍體在那發光的塘裏漂蕩着，在路邊，在房裏腐　和發臭。一股股，肉的氣味使我們聞了有點作嘔，老鼠在這村莊的四週走動着，在街上的石板咀嚼着死狗骨頭碎肉。在古井和荔枝樹上吊着，一些不願受辱的屍體，這村莊裏完全充滿死亡的烙痕，陰森的悽惻的景象，彷彿是一個被炸的墳場和刦後的戰地一樣。</p>
<p>夜是更深了。那黃家祠已定全陷在一種黑暗與死寂裏。突然在對面的鄕公所上有着燈光了；她不斷地在　格上閃動着。是襲擊的時候了。我們準備好槍枝，解下手榴彈。朝着那黃家詞。在村莊的另一個角落燃燒着了。一陣淸澈的　聲衝破了這村莊的死寂。這是我們攻擊的暗號。</p>
<p>皇軍在黃家祠門裏往外　出來，我們的槍朝着他們射擊了。一個跟一個的倒在地上。我們四面的包圍他們。他們躱進屋裏頑强地抵抗着。機關槍從那窗口裏射出來。我們的手溜彈拋出了。『轟轟轟——一一陣暴炸聲響過以後，夜空冒着一股股白烟。塵土與肉碎飛舞着。火在這裏那裏的燃燒。</p>
<p>陳中隊長的集合哨子響了。我們隊伍又集合起來。他點了人數只有一位同志手部　了點微傷。他命令我們分散了。</p>
<p>過了半個鐘頭，我們搬來了十箱子彈，七袋米和五箱罐頭，無數的鈔票，軍用券，和從敵軍身上脫下來的衣服。鞋子，和幾架小鋼炮來福槍，機關槍，馬匹等。我們每個人都很興奮，因爲這勝利給我們補充了這　多的珍寶呢！</p>
<p>村裏的人都跑光了，連那作內應的鄉長也不知跑到什麼地方去了。我們部份人把那　戰利品放在馬匹上，蓮囘我們那荔枝園的土洞裏</p>
<p>我們把那村莊放火燒掉。在黎明之前，我們的隊伍便離開那村莊了。我們在歸途的小小坡上遙望懷德鄉，只見一片鮮紅的火舌在黑暗中閃動着，跳躍着。它底光輝不但照耀了夜空的黑暗和黎明的曙色，並且照亮了中華民族解放的前途，這火花的光明將與金黃的朝陽一樣；照遍了中國每個角洛，驟走全世界的黑暗啊！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>他接受這感激以後，更頗盡一切的可能，使她得到慰安。於是，他給她遮起衣領，遮住臉頰，而且，把她散開的髮絲送進衣領以內，然後，他準備開始引導她走她上不知去向的行程。</p>
<p>臨去的時候，他用電筒照一照自己脚下的女僕——仿彿睡夢一樣的安閑；祗是呼吸不均稱，祗是在空間不住地移動看兩手，好像在尋找她被驚而飛散了的靈魂。他用脚輕輕地觸了她兩下，表示與她吿別，並祝她別後無恙；因爲他給她留下很多說話的材料。</p>
<p>他和她從容地走出了屋門，房門，很快地走盡了院中的小路。這小路，不是他來時那般的長了，彷彿祗有他去時一步之間的距離。在他和她走過院鬥的時候，守門人起了一種疑心，問她：</p>
<p>「小姐，天黑了，還出去嗎？」</p>
<p>他不讓她回答，他立刻說：</p>
<p>「不出去，往門外走嗎？」</p>
<p>守門人聽了以後，認出那囘答者便是才來的高貴而蠻橫的客人，所以他不敢再問，抵有盡可能地舒展那客人不知來由的氣憤，他笑着：</p>
<p>『我是說出去何必走呢！』</p>
<p>『不走還爬嗎？』</p>
<p>『先生，我是說公館有汽車；小姐不總是坐汽車的嗎？』</p>
<p>『坐汽車，還長腿做什麼？』</p>
<p>守門人對於無禮的客人，總是退讓的，他不得無禮。他的無禮，衹有對於退讓的客人。因爲他記得無禮的客人，常是無求於主人而另有所憑依的；反之，便常是另有企圖而盼待於主人。</p>
<p>「先生，請走吧！」</p>
<p>隨後，他鞠了躬，表示他甘心對於無禮者而有禮；免得他史被主人無禮的責罵。　（十九）</p>

<h3>The Crisis of War and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Since the successful revolution and the establishment of the 'Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,' the great nation of Russia has broken away from the old world of capitalism. Though subjected to united blockade and attacks by capitalist countries, it was eventually repelled by the young and vigorous revolutionary Red Army. They were able to devote themselves to the construction of a new world of socialist nation and the ideal of happiness, outwardly forming a state of 'isolation from the world.' In a short span of twenty-one years, they overcame all the nation's inherent poverty and hardship. They vanquished all the remnants of Imperial Russia, reactionary elements; they conquered traitors and spies on the revolutionary front, and left and right-leaning factions. They also overcame the various forms of agitation and attacks by international imperialism and fascist bandits. Furthermore, amidst continuous and arduous battles, they completed the first and second five-year plans. They eliminated the system of human oppression and exploitation of man, along with its roots. They completed the construction of a classless socialist society and smoothly began the third five-year plan to develop the national economy and realize a happy life. In these twenty-one years of arduous struggle, they created a powerful nation that has caught up with all capitalist countries, proving to the people of the old world that abandoning capitalism and imperialism and relying on the power of hardworking people can build a more solid and radically happy nation! It is particularly noteworthy that they use the weapons of fighting against nature. They have inexhaustible resources to develop. They do not need to compete for colonies or invade other countries. They only need to strive for construction in an environment of mutual peace among nations. Therefore, they firmly advocate a policy of defending world peace, opposing fascist aggression, and opposing imperialist wars that seize colonies and redistribute the world. At the same time, they adopt the liberation movement of aiding oppressed nations against wars of aggression. The Soviet Union's great success in the past twenty-one years, breaking historical precedents, has aroused the jealousy of a small number of stubborn elements and capitalist leaders. However, the Soviet Union's policy and actions of protecting peace and opposing fascist aggression are not only supported by freedom-loving and peace-loving people around the world, but also have to be trusted by all capitalist countries that demand the maintenance of democracy and peace. Therefore, whenever the international situation becomes slightly calmer, the anti-Soviet work of capitalist countries becomes active. When the world war situation is tense, the countries that demand democracy and peace cannot help but pay attention to the dynamics of the Soviet Union, and even rely on the dynamics of the Soviet Union to some extent. Therefore, at the critical moment of world war and peace, the Soviet Union has a pivotal, and even decisive, position.</p>
<p>Recently, Hitler brazenly destroyed the Munich Agreement he had signed, annexed Czechoslovakia with two cannons, occupied Memel with light cavalry, and seized Romania with a single agreement, creating an unprecedented crisis of European and even world war. On the one hand, it ruthlessly exposed the ugliness and scourge of the past hypocritical, cowardly, and compromising policies of democratic and peaceful countries. On the other hand, it proved the correctness and urgent need for the Soviet Union's policy of implementing a collective security system and defending peace by force. As a result, the people of the world, especially those in Britain and France who are suffering from the flames of fascism, are unanimously and enthusiastically demanding immediate union with the Soviet Union to implement the solidarity of democratic and peaceful countries. Establish a collective security system to jointly oppose and sanction fascist aggressors. Because only in this way can democratic politics be defended and world peace be maintained. The authorities of Britain, France, and the United States, in this extremely urgent situation and amidst the surging tide of anger, have also had to begin to change their attitude towards the Soviet Union. For example, Britain's recent economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, followed by negotiations for political cooperation (British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson et al. are currently in Moscow for negotiations), and the consultation among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the German annexation of Czechoslovakia, are preliminary manifestations of the pro-Soviet policy of democratic and peaceful countries. It is particularly noteworthy that a Washington dispatch yesterday (25th) claimed that American diplomatic and commercial experts observed that Britain and France have definitely abandoned their policy of suppressing Soviet labor, giving the Four-Power Declaration to stop Hitler a greater hope of success. They also emphasized: "The strength of Soviet Russia is more than enough to stop Germany from advancing eastward. As for the position of Soviet Russia in the Far East, considering Japan's inability to cope in China, the strength of Soviet Russia is more than enough to cope with the joint attack of Japan and Germany without feeling ashamed. Even more important is that, in addition to the Siberian Railway, an important transportation line recently completed in secret, is connected to the Outer Mongolia Highway. This transportation line is extremely important for wartime transportation. Moreover, during the Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet authorities have continuously strengthened their strength in the Far East, and their momentum cannot be underestimated." Although this observation is somewhat empty, it also shows the importance that capitalist countries attach to the Soviet Union's role in determining the fate of the world today. However, this new understanding and expectation alone is not enough. Countries around the world that demand the maintenance of democracy and peace, as the threat of a new world war gradually becomes widespread and serious, should not only quickly abandon the misguided policies of suppressing the Soviet Union in the past, but also unite with the Soviet Union and all forces that support the policy of peace in the world in a practical and down-to-earth manner. Complete the great unity of democratic and peaceful countries, consolidate and expand the democratic and peaceful front, and quickly and widely launch an anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement. If the countries can quickly and resolutely implement this step, given the seriousness of the internal difficulties and crises of the fascist aggressors and the sharpness of the contradictions between them, it can be asserted that they will be able to stop the expanding and serious crisis of world war, and achieve a peaceful and reasonable resolution of all international disputes. As for China, which is striving for liberation in its heroic resistance, it should, based on this understanding, intensify the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, strengthen various ties with the Soviet Union, promote the consolidation and expansion of the democratic and peaceful front, and resolutely oppose all × people's poisonous schemes and Han traitors' conspiracies that are concealed by smoke screens such as 'anti-communism' and 'peace.'</p>
<h3>A Fervent Hope for the Guangdong Provincial Assembly</h3>
<p>— Sun Dehua</p>
<p>In its declaration at the Provisional National Congress in April of last year, the Chinese Kuomintang very clearly stated: "The victory or defeat of the War of Resistance depends not only on military strength, but also on the strength of the people." Subsequently, the convocation of the National Political Council concentrated outstanding elements from across the country, with representatives from various anti-Japanese parties contributing to national affairs. Undoubtedly, since its convocation, the National Political Council has taken a significant step forward in promoting democratic politics and has also achieved considerable success. However, the needs of the War of Resistance necessitate greater progress in democratic politics in order to shoulder the current tasks and more smoothly mobilize the strength of the entire nation to overcome difficulties and strive for victory in the War of Resistance. This requires more rapid and large-scale organization and training of people from all walks of life, as well as further advancement in the organization of representative bodies and the promotion of the spirit of the National Political Council. The establishment of representative bodies at the provincial, municipal, and county levels is an urgent task.</p>
<p>The Second National Political Council resolved and the government decided to convene provincial, municipal, and county-level assemblies. The Third National Political Council passed several proposals to promote democratic politics. Chairman Chiang also stated in his closing remarks: "The historical mission of this council is to lay the foundation for democratic politics, to lay the foundation for permanent and genuine democratic politics." If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is, if the people cannot actively participate in political life, they cannot form a strong nation. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on the will of the people, and must take the interests and concerns of the people as its own. The convocation of provincial, municipal, and county-level assemblies is precisely in line with the interests of the Chinese nation, meets the urgent needs of the War of Resistance, and is an execution of Chairman Chiang's instruction.</p>
<p>Now, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly has decided to convene in early April, and the authorities have already selected some candidates. This is good news for the promotion of democratic politics during the War of Resistance, and it is something that every compatriot in Guangdong deeply anticipates, rejoices in, and enthusiastically supports.</p>
<p>In order for the Provincial Assembly to shoulder its great mission, for Guangdong's politics to be "built on the will of the people, and must take the interests and concerns of the people as its own," and under the leadership of the National Government and the Supreme Leader, to strengthen the close relationship between the government and the people, to mobilize the power of the masses, to overcome the difficulties in the War of Resistance, to drive the × troops out of the country, to promote the glorious tradition of the birthplace of the revolution, to recover all lost territories, and to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, the following fervent hopes are presented to the upcoming Guangdong Provincial Assembly.</p>
<p>First, it is hoped that the Guangdong Provincial Assembly will become a true representative body of the people's will, truly able to represent the opinions of the people throughout the province, and sincerely realize Chairman Chiang's instruction to "take the interests and concerns of the people as its own." The Provincial Assembly must inherit and promote the spirit of the National Political Council, which necessarily requires:</p>
<p>(1) Including representatives from various anti-Japanese parties, not only the leading Kuomintang and Communist parties in the War of Resistance, but also representatives from all anti-Japanese parties, such as the Third Party, the Youth Party, and the National Socialist Party. This is because the various anti-Japanese parties are the most politically conscious and outstanding organizations among the people of all classes, and are able to most keenly and appropriately present the interests and concerns of the people of all classes. At the same time, they can appropriately and concretely resolve them in the assembly under the premise of "nation first," concentrate their will, and work together for national liberation and victory in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(2) Including representatives and outstanding elements from various classes, vocational groups, and fields. The National Political Council has included some outstanding elements from cultural and economic groups, and outstanding elements who have a good reputation and are supported by the people in social undertakings. However, in order for the Provincial Assembly to better represent and reflect the interests and concerns of the people, it is also necessary to select representatives from workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants to work together.</p>
<p>(3) Absorbing as much as possible people with ability and prestige in the anti-Japanese movement, selecting as much as possible representatives of young students, and increasing as much as possible the number of women representatives. Mr. Sun Yat-sen always attached importance to the great role of young students and women in the revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen often said in his speeches that students should participate in the National Assembly, that the Republic of China is everyone's family, and that women are also masters of the family. Therefore, the Provincial Assembly must uphold Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will and select as many representatives of young students and women as possible, especially those with ability and prestige in the anti-Japanese movement. To this end, it is best to implement a certain degree of reduction in the age restriction on the qualifications of provincial assembly members, so that young outstanding members of the nation can devote themselves to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>(4) Increasing the number of overseas Chinese representatives as assembly members. There are a large number of overseas Chinese from Guangdong Province, especially in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the Americas, who are particularly enthusiastic about the cause of national liberation and the War of Resistance, whether in terms of spirit, material resources, manpower, or international propaganda. It is necessary to select representatives of overseas Chinese from various regions to the Provincial Assembly.</p>
<p>Second, it is hoped that the Provincial Assembly can become a sound general organ for reflecting the opinions of the people throughout the province. The Provincial Assembly is only an important link in the initial promotion of democratic politics, and it is only a preliminary and necessary step and institution for reflecting the opinions of the people throughout the province. Chairman Chiang said: "To achieve victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction, we must never rely solely on military strength, but must mobilize the spirit of the people and organize the people's already mobilized spirit. With the sum of the national spirit, will, and strength, we can serve as the backing for the soldiers at the front and as the driving force for development in the rear." Therefore, following the National Political Council, the convocation of the Provincial Assembly is intended to ensure that the Provincial Assembly can truly and fully reflect the opinions of the people throughout the province. To do this, we must quickly convene municipal and county assemblies, and even district and township assemblies, following the Provincial Assembly.</p>
<p>Third, it is hoped that a political participation movement will be launched throughout the province before the establishment of the Provincial Assembly, and that the establishment of the Provincial Assembly will be used as widespread and in-depth education and mobilization for the people's political participation movement, so that the people can fully understand the meaning of the establishment of the assembly, understand that the assembly is a representative body of their own opinions, understand what the Principle of People's Rights is, and actively provide their opinions to make the assembly's discussions and construction more substantial, and to enable the government to better understand the people's intentions and demands. At the same time, it is best for the candidates for assembly members to go deep into the people before participating in the assembly, understand the emotions and desires of the people, reflect them to the government, and it is best to do their utmost to achieve popular elections for the election of assembly members.</p>
<p>Guangdong is the birthplace of the revolution, the hometown of the great revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the holy land of the National Revolution. It should make the greatest efforts for the War of Resistance and national construction, and should play the most exemplary role in promoting democratic politics. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, Commander Zhang, and Chairman Li, and with the efforts of the compatriots throughout the province, the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly can promote the progress of democratic politics throughout the country, and at the same time, it will definitely be able to quickly determine ways to mobilize the strength of the people throughout Guangdong to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction!</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Jing Tong</p>
<p>Three years ago, several young people overseas who were willing to engage in new education work, unafraid of material difficulties and undeterred by environmental obstacles, resolutely founded Hongguang School. This may not be considered a great undertaking, but in this materialistic overseas Chinese society, without any economic support, daring to start a school can already be considered an innovation. Although they may not have the same spirit of hard work as some pioneers of life education in "Ancient Temple Living Bodhisattva" and "The Book of Life," in this rigid, conservative overseas Chinese society and corrupt educational atmosphere, they dared to loudly call for improving the long-standing abuses and harsh environment of overseas Chinese education, engaging in relentless struggle and continuous introduction.</p>
<p>Tao Xingzhi's theory of life education came to Southeast Asia. And under extremely difficult material conditions, they were not just talking, but doing. They were able to put it into practice and establish this new educational institution. In this school, they taught the children to use their brains and hands, to see if the principle of "laboring with the body and laboring with the mind" is correct. In the entire work, they also tried their best to apply the theory of the unity of teaching and doing. In practical action, they educated others and also educated themselves.</p>
<p>Around the time of the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the school had just been established for nine months. They responded to the National Education Association's National Crisis Education Program and promoted cultural propaganda for national salvation. Since the "July 7th" Incident, after the sacred national War of Resistance began, the colleagues and students of the entire school, for a long period of twenty-one months, participated in various donation activities under the condition of frugality. Whether it was purchasing national salvation bonds, donating war funds, collecting comfort items, collecting winter clothes, making first aid kits, writing comfort letters, donating to aviation construction, donating money to help refugee children, participating in charity sales, or even the recent one-dollar debt repayment campaign, they exhausted their meager strength. Many students, in addition to practicing frugality and saving their daily spending money of a few cents to carry out regular national salvation savings, also used Sundays, Saturdays (no afternoon classes), and public holidays to shine shoes for the overseas Chinese community, using the income as donations for the purchase of the "Philippine Overseas Chinese Students" airplane. Their work is still immature and lacks experience, but their enthusiasm for participating in all social national salvation work is the same as that of the children in the motherland.</p>
<p>However, in the overseas Chinese society where culture has always been backward, most people believe that overseas Chinese only need to contribute money for national salvation work, and other work seems unimportant. Therefore, in this environment, it is particularly difficult to promote any kind of work for the overseas Chinese community, or even cultural propaganda work for friendly countries. Because these works are not noticed by the general public. Although some of us may even think that if cultural work is done more actively, it will make the donation results better, the general society is ignoring it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the educational situation here, there are also such shortcomings. People who usually do not value education will not link education with the current War of Resistance work at all, and educators themselves, because they are conservative and believe that it is better to do less than to do more, although no one dares to openly oppose War of Resistance education in principle, they are confused and may as well do what they are good at, follow the old method, order class schedule two allocate work hours, ring the bell, attend class, take attendance, give lessons, dismiss class, grade papers, record scores, calculate scores, eat, sleep, and receive salary. It is easier, does not require much thought, and does not cause any trouble. If you say that he is teaching dead books, teaching books to death, what's the point of teaching books? He just lets you say it.</p>
<p>The reason why the culture and education of Southeast Asia are backward can mostly be said to be a problem of personnel, which cannot be solved properly.</p>
<p>In their school, they also felt the same difficulty. That is the lack of good teachers and the lack of guiding talents. Although there are many enthusiastic people among the colleagues, they are full of upward enthusiasm, but because they do not know how to do it, what method to use, and how to cooperate with the current environment, many jobs cannot be done. For example, if you want to implement the War of Resistance education curriculum in overseas Chinese schools, first, there are no suitable textbooks and teaching materials, second, there is not enough teaching time (this is related to the unreasonable dual school system that emphasizes both Chinese and English here), and third, because human and material resources are quite scarce, War of Resistance teaching materials cannot be widely collected, and after they are collected, they cannot be systematically compiled and distributed. The cost of living is high here, and printing materials are expensive. It is naturally impossible for a school with weak strength to compile and print its own textbooks alone; fourth, they do not have sufficient confidence themselves. To promote War of Resistance education, you must first abolish the current unreasonable school system, otherwise it will not work at all. To fundamentally transform the education system here, it will inevitably be opposed by some people who are unwilling to transform. Although they are not afraid of being regarded as heretics, or of being hungry, but because they want to promote War of Resistance education and transform the education system here, they are taken by people who are unwilling to reform as an excuse to "destroy the unity of overseas Chinese" or destroy the united front of national resistance against Japan, it would be too unjust and not worth it. To avoid friction and misunderstanding, they have thought about this problem for a long time. This is because the general public does not have a deep understanding of War of Resistance education, does not have a full understanding of the unreasonable school system here in the past, and does not have a belief in changing the original system. Perhaps these are the reasons why their work in the past three years has not been enough. The situation here is somewhat similar to the example cited by Tao Xingzhi in a recent speech in Hong Kong on "Total War of Resistance and Total Education": "I told him to implement War of Resistance education, and he said that he had not received War of Resistance education before. I told him to let others do it, but he was unwilling," (the general idea seems to be like this, because I don't have the original text and can't remember it all.) This can be used as a portrayal of education here. However, on the other hand, I am not saying that overseas Chinese education in Qing has no future or is completely impossible to transform. After all, it is not a question of subjective strength, but a question of people. If we can strengthen our subjective strength, we can currently use a gradual approach to promote this movement through efforts in all aspects under the great premise of the War of Resistance and national salvation.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we must earnestly hope that the pioneers in the education circles of the motherland and the colleagues who are currently engaged in education work in the war zone and the rear will constantly give us strong assistance and correct and more concrete guidance so that we can carry out the current work.</p>
<p>In the past, because of the lack of teachers and the unsound guiding mechanism, although they have been working continuously for three years, the work has not been very successful. Here, they once tried the "little teacher" system, but because the students' work was immature, it was not easy to find work objects, and there were often laughing stories of little teachers not finding students. At the same time, because of time constraints, colleagues and students are entangled in daily affairs, and cannot spare extra time to imitate this work (all other extracurricular work is similar). The colleagues who guide this work lack work interest, so there are too many difficulties encountered by the "little teacher", and the big teacher has no way to solve them, resulting in the work being unable to stop. However, they always believe that their understanding is correct, and the failure of the work does not discourage them. At the same time, they understand that if the unreasonable school system here is not improved, and the educational environment is not properly transformed, all work cannot be promoted. Therefore, they are now concentrating their strength to think about how to transform their environment and how to improve the current unreasonable education system.</p>
<p>In order to make the overseas Chinese community have a deeper understanding of War of Resistance education, and to enable educators themselves to increase their determination to transform our environment, they have requested the two groups of the Education Association and the Cultural Circle National Salvation Association here to host a summer War of Resistance education lecture for overseas Chinese teachers and staff. The time is limited to two months for four people (the summer season here starts from the end of March to the beginning of June, two months at the beginning and end), and the group jointly invited Mr. Tao Xingzhi to give lectures in the Philippines to guide them on how to carry out War of Resistance education work. It is believed that if the staff can realize this work, it will not only be a ray of dawn for the future of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines, but also increase a new force for the work of War of Resistance and national salvation of overseas Chinese in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>How Japan is Destroying North China's Finances</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Our city's foreign dispatches: The mainland newspaper reports that it has been a week since North China nominally abolished Chinese legal tender (fapi) and implemented a partial controlled export of foreign exchange. Judging from all the news coming from North China, these measures have encountered the same results as similar developments in the past. On the monetary front, the ban on fapi has clearly failed. Not only has fapi not depreciated or disappeared from the market, but its premium for exchanging for puppet regime currency in Beiping has continued to increase this week. In other respects, this new method of striking at Western commerce in North China has been temporarily successful. European and American export trade at the ports of Bohai and Qingdao has temporarily come to a standstill. The Japanese puppet authorities even forbid Western firms from fulfilling prior agreements in violation of the new control system. According to a Reuters dispatch from Otsu, this new economic measure in North China is backed by the Japanese military. Japanese soldiers search Chinese and foreign individuals for fapi at the entrance to the former German concession. This is a rude action by the barbaric military, completely violating the treaty rights enjoyed by Westerners. Consular jurisdiction should protect foreign property not only in law but also in fact. Whether the Japanese side likes it or not, the Chinese currency is also part of foreign property. Many Western merchants in China deeply regret that their governments have not confronted the Japanese military in North China. Most of them want to know what would happen if Western troops protected foreign cargo for export on foreign ships outside Tianjin, regardless of the orders of the Beiping puppet regime, and foreign gunboats escorted them. Of course, the whole matter is not yet over. The British House of Commons has issued sharp words and, along with the United States, has lodged a formal protest with the Tokyo government. According to Japanese press reports, the Japanese side will not pay attention to these protests. Furthermore, constitutional countries will not remain silent when their protests are rejected, and they are expected to take some form of retaliation. However, it is generally hoped that retaliation will not be directed at North China itself, as this would harm foreign interests in the area and could be indirectly manipulated by the Japanese. Therefore, retaliation must be directed directly at Japan. The new measures in North China are being implemented by the Japanese side, and Western countries must make the Japanese feel that these measures are reckless and destructive. Whether or not the Japanese puppet economic and monetary legislation in North China will ultimately succeed depends not only on the attitude of Western countries but also largely on the Chinese people. The Chinese people in the cities of North China controlled by the Japanese military do not use direct methods of force but continue to offer passive resistance through non-cooperation, making the Japanese efforts ineffective. If the Chinese side cooperates, the premium for exchanging fapi for puppet regime currency would not increase. If the Chinese continue to be consistently firm, the special institutions of the Chinese banking industry and its numerous exchange shops can be used to continue to destroy the Beiping puppet regime currency. A friend who recently returned to Shanghai from North China repeatedly urged reporters to pay attention to the price issue. He emphatically stated that the Japanese promotion and implementation of the currency measures has clearly overlooked the seriousness of the price equalization issue. It must be understood that the price of one yuan of composite currency equivalent to two shillings and two pence must be greatly reduced. In short, the foreign exchange rate currently posted by the Beiping puppet bank is about 60% higher than it should be. The Japanese hope that they will be able to lower the price and equalize it, but there is no sign of price reduction; on the contrary, it continues to rise. Even in Beiping itself, the puppet authorities have enacted numerous official price regulations, but they cannot stop the continued rise in prices. At the beginning of this week, the price of Saigon rice in Beiping jumped to an average of 25.5 yuan per bag. The prices of North China export products have also increased sharply in proportion to the expansion of currency circulation. The prices of various imported goods have also increased, as the new currency measures create new obstacles to imports and make the shortage of imported goods even more severe. The Beiping puppet bank announced the sale of foreign exchange to pay for imported goods, but no foreign merchant has sought to buy foreign exchange from it for private transactions. The puppet bank also established a so-called list of imported goods with priority, giving priority in foreign exchange supply to the goods on the list and then handling foreign exchange for other goods. The majority of the items listed are Japanese military supplies. In this situation, the first week after the implementation of the new measures in North China did not inspire confidence. This move failed to solve the major economic and financial problems; instead, it made these problems even more unstable than before.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Our Country's Debt Creditworthiness - Minister of Finance Kung Issues Statement - Customs and Salt Taxes Guarantee Various Public Debts - Government is Exerting Efforts to Maintain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Minister of Finance Kung formally issued a statement today, stating that regarding debts secured by customs and salt taxes, the government has begun negotiations with relevant parties. Before the negotiations are completed, public debts guaranteed by customs and salt taxes should be implemented in accordance with the announcement of January 15th. The same treatment should be given to public debt measures secured by customs duties. (Note: On January 15th of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that because of the arbitrary detention of customs duties by a certain military unit, the Chinese government would designate special funds at the Central Bank for repayment and interest payment. This special fund has now been allocated as announced.) However, for British and French loans, because the personnel who handled them in advance had already allocated funds from the Ministry of Finance sufficient for payment, the portion due on April 15th will still be paid on time. As for the Crisp Loan, the government has also designated funds from salt tax revenues to repay the principal and interest due to bondholders on March 30th. In general, the Chinese government, in order to fulfill its debts and safeguard the interests of bondholders, despite facing unprecedented difficulties due to Japan's invasion, is still extremely concerned about maintaining its creditworthiness. The current measures taken for various public debts secured by customs and salt taxes are temporary measures that have to be adopted due to environmental circumstances. The government absolutely does not want this to be the case and will definitely find a suitable and practical solution under the principle of adapting to the current long-term war of resistance and stabilizing China's financial and economic situation, in order to maintain China's creditworthiness.</p>

<h3>Japanese Politicians Dream - Of Resisting Britain and France - Joint Petition to Prime Minister Hiranuma - To Conclude Military Alliance with Germany and Italy</h3>

<p>[Tokyo, 25th] External news reports that Japanese statesman Saionji advised the Japanese government not to enter into a military alliance with Germany and Italy, saying that it was not because Japan did not sympathize with the goals of Germany and Italy, but because "Japan does not dare to join the losing side of the world struggle."</p>
<h3>Remodeling Inferior Goods - Massive Shipments to the Philippines - Philippine Officials and Merchants Seek Effective Resistance - Special Commissioners Dispatched to Hong Kong for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Local News] Because its invasion of China cannot be sustained for long, and to attempt to salvage its economic collapse, [Japan] has had to intensify its policy of economic plunder, underselling and seizing markets. As a result, in recent months, the Hong Kong market has seen a surge in Japanese goods, jumping from a monthly low of 600,000-700,000 yuan to over 700,000 yuan. The number of Japanese goods going to British, French, and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia, as well as the American possessions of the Philippines and Tianjin, is even more alarming. Among them, the Philippines has the largest market for Japanese goods, and most of the goods being dumped into the Philippines are remodeled in Hong Kong before shipment. Two years ago, the Philippine authorities ordered customs to earnestly prevent the transit of these remodeled Japanese goods, and the diplomatic authorities protested to Japan, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Investigations reveal that the remodeling of Japanese goods in Hong Kong for shipment to the Philippines is continuing. Evolving to the present day, in order to adapt to the strategy of underselling and seizing markets, the practice is gradually intensifying. The Philippine commodity market is under great pressure, and local industries are directly hit hard. Both the American and Philippine authorities cannot but pay more attention. Because Japanese actions have shattered the Gentlemen's Agreement between America and Japan, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to effectively respond. According to sources from a certain Chinese trading house in Hong Kong, it is estimated that the total value of Japanese goods remodeled and shipped to the Philippines via Hong Kong each month is approximately 200,000-300,000 yuan, both overtly and covertly. Generally, after Japanese goods pass through Hong Kong, they are forwarded to the Philippines through certain Hong Kong trading houses and foreign firms, or secretly shipped via various routes. It is estimated that in the past six months, the amount of these remodeled Japanese goods being shipped to the Philippines has been increasing daily.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, American goods are being crowded out in the Philippine market, and the development of Philippine industry is dealt a fatal blow. Therefore, the American and Philippine authorities are currently considering taking strong measures to protect the Philippine commodity market and the development of local large and small industries. In addition to the Philippine customs conducting serious and strict inspections of imported goods, they also want to obtain information from Hong Kong about the remodeling and shipment of goods to the Philippines in order to formulate effective response strategies. Recently, two special commissioners have been dispatched to Hong Kong by the Philippine authorities to undertake this investigation. After arriving in Hong Kong, the two commissioners have been conducting investigations with relevant parties and are expected to leave Hong Kong and return to the Philippines in the near future to report their findings.</p>
<h3>Evolution of Political Work</h3>
<p>- Zhang Fakui, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Area</p>
<p>And the Qualities Political Workers Should Possess</p>
<p>- Instructions to the Fifth Political Work Brigade of the Political Department -</p>
<p>Your Brigade, due to the needs of the work, will soon be assigned to the front lines. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all health and success. The opinions I want to offer you today are what I, standing in the position of a representative commander, expect from all of you political instructors. I hope you will pay special attention and earnestly implement them!</p>
<p>Before formally offering my opinions, I would like to systematically review the role that political workers have played in the process of the National Revolution in the past, in order to illustrate the importance of political work and the position and efforts that political workers should have in the National Revolution.</p>
<p>First, we must ask, why before the Northern Expedition, could the Three Principles of the People not gain the belief and protection of the broad masses of the people? Why could the National Revolution not be rapidly promoted and successful? Why in the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], were we able to overthrow the Northern Warlords in a very short period and completely unify the North and South? The crux of the matter is that before the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], our headquarters failed to pay the greatest attention to the establishment and promotion of political work in the army and among the people.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Premier ordered the leader to establish the Whampoa Military Academy, to intensify the training of military and political cadres to shoulder this arduous task. In the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], during the Northern Expedition, I served as a division commander. I personally witnessed the vigorous activity of political workers in the army and among the people. In a short period of time, they were able to change the traditional warlord thinking in the army into the revolutionary thinking of the Three Principles of the People, and transform the scattered, fatalistic people into an organized and united, heroic and fighting people. They transformed the phenomenon of opposition between the army and the people into a phenomenon of close cooperation between the army and the people. Under these circumstances, the Northern Expeditionary Army was able to advance victoriously without hindrance. This was a great success of political work, and this period was also the most smooth and prestigious period for political workers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since then, political work has been rejected, and the position of political workers has plummeted. The political training office has become nothing more than a decorative ornament in the troops. The officers in charge of the troops did not understand the importance of political work and adopted an arrogant or contemptuous attitude towards the political workers, and the political workers only looked to the officers in charge for guidance, not daring to say anything. Even army-people joint events were not dared to be held, let alone political education and guidance for officers and soldiers. Therefore, since the outbreak of the "August 13th" War of Resistance [Battle of Shanghai, 1937], all weaknesses have been fully exposed, which affected the initial military setbacks of the War of Resistance. This simple army and government's war of resistance is a concrete manifestation of the slackening of political work, and this period is also the most difficult and painful period for political workers.</p>
<p>Due to the attention of the supreme leader and Minister Chen, and the military and political leaders of various war zones, and in view of the fact that the difficulties in the initial stages of the war were not due to inferior equipment, but to insufficient political mobilization, in order to advance political and military affairs simultaneously and strive for final victory, the central government finally formally established the Political Department on August 1st of last year [1938], re-establishing political training work in the troops and among the people. At the same time, the position and prestige of political workers gradually increased with the improvement of the entire political situation. This period is a period of revival for political work.</p>
<p>War is a continuation of politics. Especially in the Sino-Japanese War, we must pay more attention to political mobilization and improvement to compensate for our military deficiencies. Therefore, the leader clearly instructed us at the Hengshan Conference: "Politics is more important than military affairs," and this is the reason.</p>
<p>Now that you are also being assigned to the front lines, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the necessary qualifications that I hope political workers will possess. I believe that the qualifications that a political worker must possess are as important as the qualifications that a military worker must possess. A military worker must know how to lead troops, train troops, and use troops to be worthy of being a commander; and a political worker must also possess the necessary qualifications to be worthy of being a political worker.</p>
<p>What are the necessary qualifications for a political worker?</p>
<p>First, you must have a great personality and noble morality. This means that your life must be serious, your behavior must be upright, your beliefs must be determined, you must value integrity, be ashamed of wrongdoing, be brave in the face of righteousness, not be intimidated by difficulties, not yield to violence, not be swayed by greed, and be responsible for your work. You must be tolerant to your comrades, be strict with yourself, lenient with others, have no competition for power, and have no sectarian views. Only in this way can you gain the trust of officers, soldiers, and the people, and be worthy of being a role model for officers, soldiers, and the people.</p>
<p>Second, you must have a spirit of hard work, endurance, and courageous sacrifice. This means that you must go deep into the lower levels, truly share the joys and sorrows with the soldiers, and integrate with the people. You must train the troops, educate, and organize the people in a down-to-earth manner. You receive less pay than others, but you must endure more hardships and do more work than others. You are not afraid of difficulties, and you do not succumb to difficulties. On the contrary, you should use greater perseverance and more methods to deal with difficulties and overcome difficulties. You must always stand at the forefront of the struggle, be determined to succeed or die, and never hesitate or waver. Only in this way can you influence others, inspire others, and motivate others to move forward.</p>
<p>Third, you must have a kind and approachable attitude. Because the cultural level of Chinese soldiers and the people is very low, to make them accept your training and leadership, you must first have a very sincere attitude to accept them, help them solve difficulties, and patiently carry out persuasion, education, and guidance, so that they feel that you are as kind as their own family members. Only in this way can your work be effective.</p>
<p>Fourth, you must be able to earnestly abide by and promote all wartime laws and regulations of the government. This means that political workers must fully understand all wartime laws and regulations issued by the government, such as the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction, the Regulations on Conscription of Strong Laborers, and the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers of the War of Resistance, and must carry out and promote work based on the government's wartime laws and regulations. Because if we violate the government's laws and regulations, it will inevitably cause friction and reduce our own strength to resist the invasion. If we are perfunctory and neglectful, and fail to earnestly supervise the implementation, then the so-called mobilization of the people is just empty talk.</p>
<p>Fifth, you must be able to meet military requirements. Because most political workers are intellectuals with a strong tendency towards romanticism, liberalism, and individualism, but you have all received military training, and I think you can all abide by military requirements. However, what we mean by militarization here is not just neat clothing and attention to etiquette, but also a spirit of vigor, unity of will, simple and collective life, and swift and decisive work. Only in this way can you improve the efficiency of your work and adapt to the needs of wartime.</p>
<p>Sixth, you must have high scholarship and rich experience. This means that you must pay attention to the issue of self-training. On the one hand, you must continuously learn in practical work, encourage each other, review each other, and criticize each other. On the other hand, you must explore, research, and help each other in the Three Principles of the People, the Premier's instructions, the leader's speeches on the War of Resistance, and other valuable books and newspapers. In this way, you can enrich yourselves and strengthen yourselves. I believe that the best national salvation worker should possess various skills. He is not only a propagandist, but also a theorist, organizer, and practitioner. In the past, political workers were rejected and ridiculed as peddlers of panaceas because they only engaged in empty talk and did not attend to practical matters. Now you should pay special attention to your own cultivation and training, and show people your true skills and real goods. You must make sure that your panacea is not a fake panacea, but a real medicine that can cure diseases and be effective. In this way, people will naturally trust you, welcome you, respect you, and wash away the slander, ridicule, and all the bad phenomena of the past regarding political workers.</p>
<p>Brothers, my knowledge of political affairs is very shallow, but before you leave, I want to share some of my past experiences and insights with you, hoping that everyone can do your best based on what I have said. I believe that everyone will have even more brilliant and glorious achievements in the second phase of the War of Resistance. (Special article from the National Salvation Society)</p>

<h3>Tensions Rise Between Poland and Germany: Clashes Near Teschen, Poland Reinforces Border Defenses and Conducts Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>【Warsaw, 25th】Foreign Dispatch: The Polish government, considering that the country is surrounded by Germany and German residents in the Polish Corridor are secretly carrying out armaments, will decide on the course of action to be taken within 24 hours. Polish President Mościcki has convened an important meeting of the cabinet and military leaders to make important decisions. General Rydz-Śmigły, the current Inspector General of the Polish Army, has had lengthy discussions with staff officers, and it is expected that military considerations will play a significant role in the discussions.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Warsaw, 25th】Polish troops guarding the border with Germany are currently being reinforced. Air defense exercises are being held in various parts of Poland, and patriotic propaganda is very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>【London, 25th】Foreign Dispatch: A "Times" correspondent in Warsaw reports that Poland is still unwilling to join the anti-German bloc proposed by Britain, but is prepared to join a union based on genuine collective security. The people of Poland are currently shaken. In the town of Teschen (which Poland seized from Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement), clashes have occurred between Poles and Germans. Approximately 800 German troops arrived near Teschen but retreated after being confronted by Polish regular troops. The Daily Telegraph reports that Poland has the capacity to mobilize four million people nationwide and is currently planning to mobilize one million.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Warsaw, 25th】Over the past three days, there have been repeated reports of clashes between Polish and German troops in the vicinity of Pukemin, on the border between Slovakia and Poland. However, these reports have not yet been confirmed. It is rumored that German troops retreated after fierce fighting with Polish border guards, and it is expected that this will not lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Warsaw, 25th】Today, the Polish army's official newspaper published an article stating, "We are prepared to fight any strong × people. We intend to sort out all matters clearly. Poland is in no way inferior to any great power. As for the number of × people divisions, their technical equipment, and their exaggerated claims, the Polish people have no fear whatsoever. On the contrary, our military strength, the technical equipment of our army, and the fighting spirit of our entire nation are sufficient to guarantee a solid victory. We are certain that the bayonets of the Polish army will secure victory, therefore we are arrayed and waiting."</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Berlin, 26th】The Foreign Communications newspaper recently published an officially authorized article stating that a strong Poland is an indispensable force for maintaining order in Eastern Europe, and there is a political need for this. Germany has no intention of aggression against Poland.</p>
<p>Four-Power Declaration Seems to Have Faded, Soviet and French Advocate a Hard Line Against Germany</p>
<p>【Reuters, London, 26th】A diplomatic correspondent for the "Observer" recently stated, "The originally planned Four-Power Declaration has now faded away because Poland has no intention of participating in this demonstration of action to deal with German aggression, as the purpose of this demonstration can only be achieved through an international conference. On the other hand, the Soviet Union suggests that when Germany invades or poses a threat, it should be met immediately with fully cooperative military action. This point is also difficult for Poland to agree to, because Poland maintains a neutral stance between Germany and the Soviet Union as a principle, which remains unchanged. Therefore, it does not welcome Soviet troops entering Poland, regardless of their mission. It is believed that the French government is not particularly upset about the failure of this Four-Power Declaration plan, and is instead focused on the belief that the British and French governments should quickly concentrate their efforts to cooperate in preventing German westward aggression. As for the Soviet government, setting aside the situation in the Far East, it believes that only close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, taking military action against Germany, can stop German aggression. Soviet sources explained that this military cooperation should apply to both German eastward and westward aggression, and its scope should include countries in both eastern and western Europe, with the aim, as the British see it, of at least immediately declaring war on Germany and using the British fleet to blockade Germany."</p>
<p>【London, 25th】Foreign Dispatch: Discussions among interested countries regarding a joint guarantee declaration are still progressing. The visit of the French President and Foreign Minister Bonnet to London has resulted in satisfaction on both the British and French sides. These two countries are now engaged in discussing more practical new methods. The Soviet Ambassador has visited the Foreign Office several times in the past few days. Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax last night, reiterating Poland's position. Hudson will return to England next week, bringing with him what he has learned in Warsaw and Moscow regarding the European situation, for the Polish Foreign Minister Beck to consider when he discusses matters with England on April 4.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, London, 25th】Foreign Secretary Halifax has decided to remain in London this weekend to observe the development of the European situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain, who was resting in Chequers, is expected to return here tomorrow evening.</p>
<p>【Reuters, Paris, 15th】Today, "Le Figaro" stated that in view of Germany's insatiable aggression, Poland, in order to devise countermeasures, should "consider itself the protector of Eastern Europe." The press here welcomes the establishment of a peace front, but believes that stronger and more agile actions must be taken. "L'Ordre" stated that only a policy of confrontation can separate Italy from the "Axis." The Communist Party's newspaper stated, "In order to prevent sudden aggression, peace-loving democratic countries must arm themselves in addition to diplomatic notes."</p>
<p>Small Countries Uneasy, British and French Military Cooperation, French Foreign Minister Expresses Optimism</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Paris, 26th】Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Daladier yesterday to report on his visit to England, expressing a very optimistic attitude, stating that British Prime Minister Chamberlain still believes that Poland can participate in the joint declaration on jointly defending Romania to issue a warning to Hitler. Britain has decided to implement a conscription system similar to military service in the short term. As a result of the London talks, both parties have agreed that if either Britain or France is invaded anywhere, the naval, land, and air forces of both countries can immediately act in concert.</p>
<p>【Central News Agency, Paris, 25th】Political figures here recently stated that the difficulties encountered in forming an international front against German aggression have been due to the British government's hesitation in implementing a conscription system. When President Lebrun visits Britain, British and French cabinet members will take the opportunity to hold talks. The results of these talks show that the British authorities have a more progressive view on the implementation of a conscription system. British cabinet members have provided assurances to the French authorities, stating that preparatory measures will be taken in the short term. It is not yet known whether these preparatory measures refer to a genuine conscription system. Therefore, it is questionable whether small countries can rest easy and provide guarantees. The country has already rejected this, and is also unwilling to participate in the formation of a joint front between Britain and France for the same reason. Switzerland has a similar attitude. As for Latvia, it is also unwilling to incur Germany's displeasure by appearing to encourage anti-German movements. However, although small countries are reluctant to participate in international actions, they are in fact feeling uneasy and are taking appropriate military measures separately, and have decided to defend their independence and sovereignty when necessary. Based on this, if Britain can implement a conscription system and provide direct military guarantees to these small countries, the current situation will definitely change completely. It is hoped that the British government, on the one hand, can improve relations with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, can guide its own parliament to pass a conscription law, which will greatly contribute to maintaining peace in Europe.</p>

It is understood that after Franco tore up the peace proposal brought by General Casado on Thursday, the government army immediately received the "final ultimatum."

<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Declares Occupation of Ruthenia Inevitable, No Intentions Towards Romania</h3>
<p>【Reuters, Budapest, 25th】Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky issued a statement yesterday, urging Romania not to misunderstand the purpose of Hungarian military activities on the Hungarian-Romanian border. Csáky said that Yugoslavia's attitude towards recent events was very correct, but Romania had failed to show the same attitude, so he had to inform the Romanian authorities that, under any circumstances, Hungary would definitely occupy Ruthenia. Although Hungarian troops have been active on the border, they have no intentions towards Romania. However, if Romania does not understand and resorts to coercion, war will inevitably result. Csáky also stated affirmatively, "Romania has expressed surprise at our occupation of Little Russia and insists that a corner of the east belongs to them and is not willing to let us have it. We can hardly agree." Hungary is prepared to hold talks with Romania, but Romania must first restore its original state.</p>

<p>【Central News Agency, Prague, 26th】The Slovak military commander stationed in Prešov recently stated that a ceasefire agreement has been reached with the Hungarian army and that the conflict has ceased.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Speech to Address Demands on France, Hitler and Göring Express Support for Italy</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Rome, 26th】According to authoritative sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech today will address Italy's demands on France and the Spanish war. At the same time, the Italian Prime Minister intends to defend the policy of a totalitarian state in response to the recent speeches by French Prime Minister Daladier in the Chamber of Deputies. As for Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Memel, Italy will indirectly defend it, and the various trends of democratic countries confronting totalitarian states will be condemned. According to senior officials of the Fascist Party, if the Italian Prime Minister mentions the demands on France, it will definitely not be in a provocative manner.</p>
<p>【Associated Press, Berlin, 26th】On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Italian Fascist Party, Hitler sent a telegram to Mussolini, stating that Germany is willing to work hand in hand with Italy, helping each other and standing watch. It is a pity for the outside world's misunderstandings and hostile attitudes, but for the sake of their own interests, the two countries do not need to pay attention to the outside world's rumors. It is also understood that it is rumored that Germany has a "large part of satisfaction" in its own demands because of the recent acquisition of vast lands and other economic benefits in the Czech Republic and other places. Therefore, it is not as enthusiastic about the German-Italian axis as before. However, according to sources in Berlin, the German authorities are sincerely afraid that this kind of rumor will harm the good friendship between the two countries, so they have notified the Italian authorities that the close ties of the German-Italian axis are as close as before.</p>
<p>【Associated Press, Rome, 26th】Göring published an article in the Messaggero newspaper yesterday, guaranteeing that Germany is determined to work closely with Italy at all costs. The unity of the German-Italian axis remains extremely solid. Göring also quoted the English proverb "Barking dogs seldom bite" to attack Britain. Göring's remarks have attracted general attention, and it is believed that the rumors of the weakening of the German-Italian axis after the German annexation of the Czech Republic are incredible, and that Mussolini will satisfy his desires to France without spending a single soldier or a single weapon.</p>
<p>【Haitong News Agency, Rome, 26th】Both Rome and Paris denied foreign newspaper reports that the relations between France and Italy were being smoothed by the dispatch of personnel from the French side. According to French sources, Lagardelle has a good impression of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but has not met with the Italian Prime Minister for two years. The Roman side also denied the matter and accused the American news agency of fabrication, saying that German troops and German planes had arrived in Italy.</p>
<h3>New German Battleship Named "Tirpitz" to be Launched on April 1</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, Berlin, 26th】The German battleship recently completed, with a displacement of 35,000 tons, has been decided to be named "Tirpitz" in memory of the late German Admiral. The new ship is scheduled to be launched in Wilhelmshaven on April 1.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Talks Have Reached Concrete Stage</h3>
<p>【Reuters, Moscow, 25th】British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan continued negotiations all day and have reached a concrete discussion of British-Soviet trade relations. It is understood that the negotiations will continue until the weekend.</p>
<h3>Death of British Veteran Politician</h3>
<p>【Haitong News Agency, London, 16th】British Member of the House of Lords, Earl Sanderson, passed away yesterday afternoon at the age of seventy. The Earl was the only blind Member of Parliament and was highly regarded in British political circles. He was greatly supported when MacDonald, the leader of the Labour Party, formed his second cabinet in 1930. He was granted noble title in the same year. In March 1938, he withdrew from the Labour Party because he believed that the Labour Party's policies affected peace. He authored many books and enjoyed a reputation as an economic expert.</p>
<h3>American People Demand Construction of Air-Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>【Reuters, Washington, 25th】The US Army Department announced today that the American people are now demanding that the government build air-raid shelters. The European crisis in September of last year and the recent tension in Central Europe have intensified this demand. Among them, some have requested instructions on building air-raid shelters similar to those in Europe. Some requests come from as far away as Arkansas. Military engineers said that there is no reason for the American people to fear air raids as the British and French people do. Even if the United States is involved in the war, it will not be subjected to air raids. However, in view of the increasing range of aircraft, the government is also planning to build air-raid shelters and so on to protect the people.</p>
<p>Short Comments</p>
<h3>Improving the Lives of Female Workers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, local newspapers reported that the Labor Group of the YWCA has been working hard to improve the lives of female workers since its establishment, such as establishing schools, organizing friendship groups, and establishing labor centers, etc. It can be said that it has done its best to improve the moral, intellectual, physical, and communal aspects and the actual lives of female workers.</p>
<p>The hardships of the lives of working-class compatriots are of course not unique to Hong Kong, and the plight of female workers is even more unimaginable by the general middle class and above. How to improve the lives of female workers is certainly not a simple problem, and the so-called improvement is not a thorough solution. However, if everyone can pay attention to this problem and everyone is enthusiastic about finding ways to improve it, it will not only help female workers but also benefit society. Therefore, the work of the YWCA Labor Group should arouse attention. We hope that this improvement work can be extended to all walks of life and that the improvement situation will be published at any time. At the same time, we hope that those engaged in improvement work will use Christ's sacrificial heart of saving the world and firm belief to promote and persuade hard, so that the factory owners will improve the treatment of female workers, at least to obtain the guarantee of food, clothing, warmth, and health, to obtain the right to read, learn about national affairs, and participate in community activities.</p>
<h3>Congratulating the First Anniversary of the Writers' Association</h3>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of the establishment of the China National Association of Literary and Art Circles. Wuhan, the location of the founding conference last year, has now fallen under the iron hooves of the × people, which is something that no Chinese literary and art worker can fail to feel. However, the National Association of Literary and Art Circles is an organization established by Chinese literary and art workers in the common demand of resisting the Japanese and building the nation in the midst of the × people's artillery fire. At this time when the War of Resistance has entered an emergency phase and the success of the revolution is still very far away, the tasks of this organization and all its members are also particularly arduous. Therefore, we cannot but expect it to progress, and we cannot but expect literary and art workers across the country to take the Writers' Association as the center, consolidate unity, concentrate their efforts, and serve the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>The members of the Writers' Association who are staying in Hong Kong have established the Hong Kong Liaison Office yesterday. Given Hong Kong's current cultural status and its significant impact on domestic and international culture, we cannot but be pleased with its establishment, and we cannot but hope that it will make greater efforts to reconcile the relationship between literary and art workers in Hong Kong, transport international literary and art works, contact international literary and art writers, treat domestic and foreign writers with hospitality, and transmit domestic and foreign literary and art information, etc., in order to fulfill its task as a "literary and art transportation station."</p>
<h3>The Future Trend of British Far East Policy?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang</p>
<p>Idealists of a purely idealistic persuasion have been deeply perplexed and confused by the intricate and complex trends in British policy in recent years. Britain's recognition of Italy's conquest of Abyssinia; British Prime Minister Chamberlain's compromise with Hitler, partitioning Czechoslovakia; and most recently, the British recognition of Franco's government in Spain, have all shocked them.</p>
<p>Observers of the Far East situation have expressed sympathy for China's heroic resistance against aggression. Britain also sympathizes with China's resistance, yet it seems to maintain a cautious distance, as if tacitly permitting Japan to ravage large swathes of Chinese territory. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>When material interests determine policy, indifference is merely a superficial disguise. In reality, it still follows the direction of self-interest. The future development of British Far East policy is likely to be shocking. Those who wish to avoid such shocks, especially the Chinese people, should remember Lord Palmerston's maxim: Britain has no permanent ideals, only permanent interests.</p>
<p>Britain recognized Italy's conquest of Abyssinia because it wanted to discuss with Mussolini safeguarding British interests. Mussolini's military actions threatened Britain's huge cotton industry interests in Sudan. Lake Tana in Abyssinia is the source of the Nile River, which is the lifeblood of Britain's cotton industry in Sudan. Without water, there would be no cotton. Therefore, Britain compromised with Mussolini and recognized Italy's aggression, because this was far better than entering a war unprepared.</p>
<p>The partitioning of Czechoslovakia was the same: because, if it had not been done that way, Britain might have been drawn into a European war. But Britain was not prepared for war, it could not fight!</p>
<p>The Spanish issue was more complicated. Britain certainly hoped that Spain would establish a democratic government and maintain friendly relations with Britain. However, since the collapse of the Spanish monarchy in April 1931, it has been clear that the Spanish Civil War was not a conflict between democracy and fascism, but a struggle between fascism and social revolution. Britain preferred Spain to be fascist rather than a successful social revolution, because, although fascism would damage British interests on the Iberian Peninsula, a successful social revolution would completely destroy British interests there.</p>
<p>Britain's policy of non-intervention only benefited Franco, shocking the general public. Did democratic Britain really want to aid Franco? Yes, this is an undeniable fact. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain saw that Franco was about to achieve final victory, he recognized the new fascist government. Did he have a special fondness for Franco? No, all of Britain's actions followed its own interests. Spain, in any case, would become a third-rate country subordinate to others. If Britain did not recognize Franco's regime, Hitler and Mussolini would use Franco, under the guise of restoring Spain, to begin building a new Spain and developing their own power. Therefore, Chamberlain's reputation as a realist is not without reason.</p>
<p>Will Chamberlain's "realism" produce a Munich in the Far East? This question is difficult to predict. Some fear that the British government's realistic means will be repeated in the Far East. However, on January 15 of this year, the British government sent a note to Japan, no longer remaining silent on Japan's "New Order in East Asia" plan, and at the same time, providing substantial aid to China with a large loan.</p>
<p>Britain once strongly condemned Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, even adopting economic sanctions against Italy. When Czechoslovakia's independence was threatened, Britain was the first to respond. When Franco's air force bombed undefended cities of the Spanish Republican government and sank British ships, Britain repeatedly protested. Japan's atrocities in China repeatedly damaged British interests, and Britain has also repeatedly protested. This situation is clearly in people's memory. The current question is whether Britain's response to China's anti-aggression resistance can be like its response to Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, and Spain. Will Britain's "sympathy" for China and its protests to the aggressor turn into a compromise with the aggressor?</p>
<p>According to general estimates, British investment in China is worth about £240 million, six times larger than that of the United States. Britain's trade interests in China are also very large. Britain bases its Far East policy on protecting this huge interest, not on any abstract ideals.</p>
<p>Currently, the Chamberlain government's policy is to aid China so that China can continue to resist and resist aggression. If China surrenders to Japan, British interests in China will suffer a serious blow. At that time, the only way for Britain to restore its inherent interests would be to wage war against Japan. London estimates that if China can continue to resist, Japan will reach a state of exhaustion and welcome the arrival of peace. Britain hopes to be able to mediate and obtain a peace that protects British interests. This is the true meaning of Britain's note to Japan on January 15 and the large loan to China.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated in the House of Lords on the 1st of this month that Britain is willing to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. This is not accidental. He said: "When the appropriate time arrives, the British government will not hesitate to take all necessary steps to mediate the war." The so-called "appropriate time" refers to Britain, not China.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict what impact the recent Slovakian event will have on Britain's activities. However, the leaders of the British Conservative Party, when considering protecting British interests in China, have undoubtedly increased their anxiety. If war breaks out in Europe, Britain will have no time to focus on the Far East, and its interests in East Asia will be greatly damaged by Japan.</p>
<p>The United States' military expansion and its tendency toward isolationism also have a significant impact on British policy. The activities of the United States have a considerable influence on Britain's dominions—Canada, Australia, New Zealand—and even India. Recently, the United States is proposing to convene another Washington Conference, to be held in Brussels (the capital of Belgium) or Washington. It is said that China's leaders agree to such an international conference. However, if China wants to achieve victory at the conference table, it must first achieve victory on the battlefield. This is the lesson of history. China's most reliable friends are its own weapons and the people's firm spirit of resistance. Everything else is unnecessary to consider.

<h3>Demand After the War of Resistance: The Flourishing Development of Overseas Chinese Industry in Hong Kong. There are now nearly 2,000 Factories of All Sizes in Hong Kong. Products from Overseas Chinese are Crowded Out by National Goods and Sales are Brisk.</h3>
<p>In recent years, the industry of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong has progressed unusually rapidly. Since the War of Resistance, it has become increasingly prosperous, and its future is very optimistic. The establishment of overseas Chinese factories in Hong Kong began only in the last decade. As a commercial port, Hong Kong rarely attracted attention for its industrial development in the past. Later, as the environment changed, Hong Kong's industry gradually developed from its infancy, and the establishment of various factories increased with the times. The Hong Kong government also recognized the need to develop industry and made every effort to facilitate or assist the establishment of various factories. After the War of Resistance, due to the demands of the times, overseas Chinese and mainland businessmen invested in and established various industries in Hong Kong, which greatly increased the number. Therefore, in a short period of time, Hong Kong's industry has achieved vigorous development.</p>
<p>Huge Production and Sales, Especially Smooth in Overseas Markets</p>
<p>According to unofficial statistics, there are currently nearly 1,000 factories of various sizes in Hong Kong that manufacture various industrial products, and there are about 700 to 800 other small factories and cottage industries. Weaving is the most developed of the various industries, such as coarse cloth, shirts, thread, and other woven products. The monthly output is extremely large, especially after the Anti-Japanese War, the production and sales of local woven cloth and dyed goods have increased significantly. The sales markets for the products of various factories now cover the Malay Archipelago, British and Dutch possessions, North and South America, Borneo, and places where overseas Chinese reside. Especially the British colonies such as Singapore, which have the advantage of preferential taxes, the sales market is particularly large. After the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, vigorously promoted national goods. In the past, goods from Hong Kong have replaced goods from foreign countries in sales markets. Therefore, in the last two years, national industrial products from Hong Kong have become more popular in overseas markets, which has made Hong Kong manufacturers even more excited. This is truly a unique opportunity to develop Hong Kong's industry.</p>
<p>Factories in Occupied Areas Mostly Relocate to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the fall of Shanghai the year before last, the original factories in Shanghai have also moved to Hong Kong one after another. Within a year last year, about 15 to 20 large and small factories from Shanghai moved to Hong Kong. The total amount of investment by Shanghai businessmen in Hong Kong reached tens of millions. When Xiamen and Guangzhou in South China were successively abandoned, many factories in the two places also moved to Hong Kong. More than a dozen factories have moved to Hong Kong from Guangzhou alone, and about 20 factories have moved from Xiamen. The types of products are roughly ironware, hardware, silk, weaving, and glass utensils. The above-mentioned foreign manufacturers have considerable connections with local manufacturers in Hong Kong. Regarding the future development direction, it is hoped that various domestic products should use more domestic raw materials and strive to improve products to strengthen the position of domestic goods. Regarding cooperation between manufacturers and the banking industry in providing loans, many foreign manufacturers have adopted this method. Although many manufacturers in Hong Kong have ample capital, in order to further develop industry and establish great industries, cooperation with the banking industry is still extremely necessary.</p>

In addition to holding a national salvation singing movement conference, they also conducted a solemn spiritual training. Those who attended the meeting that day included the president of the conference, Lin Zifeng, pastors Fang Yuehan, Huang Dunhan, Peng Zhidong, and several thousand guests. The atmosphere was extremely solemn, especially when everyone raised the flag, sang the national anthem, and swore to abide by the "National Covenant," the atmosphere was particularly tense. Then, the president of the conference, Lin Zifeng, delivered a speech, saying that in today's flag-raising ceremony, I look up at the brilliance of the national flag, which makes me even more determined to protect the country. Although the weather has not been good in recent days, you have all enthusiastically participated. Such strong emotions are enough to swallow mountains and rivers and be invincible. Therefore, I feel even more that China's War of Resistance has entered a new stage, and the future is becoming clearer and clearer. Finally, I sincerely hope that all singing comrades will emit angry and clear songs to enhance the anti-war power of the heroic soldiers in the front and rear. The National Covenant of the conference is divided as follows: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association Federation will hold the fifth Children's Day. This year's event focuses on encouraging children in Hong Kong to rescue Chinese refugee children. Starting from April 1, students from various schools will be responsible for donating flags, and all income will be used to protect Chinese war-zone refugee children. It is heard that the association will convene a joint school meeting at 7:00 p.m. today to discuss the progress of the work.

It is heard that the participants in this session are unusually enthusiastic. The venues have been determined to be Entertainment, Queen's, Lee Theatre, Peace, and Dongle, etc., and Lee Theatre and Dongle Theatre have agreed to loan them for free. Other theaters are also expected to reduce rental fees. Hong Kong and Kowloon buses will also add more vehicles and reduce fares according to last year's practice to facilitate elementary school students to attend the meeting. The person in charge of the association has also requested the Central Traffic Police Department to send traffic police on the morning of April 4 to protect students from various schools along the way. The association's declaration, opening remarks, and various speeches will also be submitted for review tonight. The lyrics of the Children's Day song are as follows: (1) Today is a grand festival, the singing is warm and supply, singing to celebrate children, although young, their ambitions are not small, I am the master of the world, Children's Day, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, Children's Day, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, (2) A pair of small hands can work, a small brain thinks intelligently, working and working, not relying on people, thinking and thinking can succeed, Children's Day, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, (3) Don't look down on me, children, I have an axe and a knife in my hand, to create a new world, the scene is different from before, Children's Day, everyone is infinitely happy, students from various schools who want to get this song, can get it from the association, now someone intends to ask the conference to invite Chinese war-zone refugee children to Hong Kong to attend the meeting, so that children in Hong Kong and Kowloon can sit together with the refugee children and celebrate together. If this case can be passed, then the children's day will be more meaningful.</p>

<h3>Min Paper Sales Increase Greatly in Hong Kong, Reaching More Than 200,000 Yuan per Month.</h3>
<p>After the shift in the situation in Huafu, cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou has gradually increased, and many local products from Guangdong and Fujian are sold through Lian Harbor. Among the agricultural products of Min Province, in addition to tea, bamboo products, and miscellaneous grains, local paper is the largest category. The local paper produced in Min, such as "grass paper" and "Yu Kou paper," as well as various store ledgers and stationery, have long been known at home and abroad. In the past, local paper from Min Province was sold a lot in Guangdong and other places, and it was also widely sold in Hong Kong and various ports in Nanyang. It is estimated that the monthly exports from Min Province reach one million yuan, saving a lot of outward profits. Recently, Min paper has become more active in the Hong Kong market. The population has increased by hundreds of thousands, and the daily consumption of grass paper alone is not small. It is understood that the current sales of Min paper in Hong Kong reach more than 200,000 Hong Kong dollars per month, and the amount shipped from Hong Kong to various parts of Nanyang is more than double this amount. It is estimated that the total value of Min paper shipped overseas through Hong Kong in recent times is more than 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per month, and the number shipped to various provinces in the country, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan, is also very large.</p>

<h3>The Housing Problem is Still Very Serious. The Tenant Protection Ordinance Will Be Extended for Another Year. This Ordinance Was Implemented in June Last Year for a Period of One Year. The Hong Kong Government is Now Considering Extending the Effective Period for One Year.</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the National War of Resistance, people from all over the country have flocked to Hong Kong, causing a housing panic. Landlords seized the opportunity to oppress and make profits, and the trend of rent increases and forced evictions became increasingly serious. The Hong Kong government, in order to protect tenants, issued an order in June last year to implement the eviction of tenants and prevent rent increases. The ordinance is valid for one year, and it will expire in June this year, which is more than two months away. Whether to extend the implementation period or abolish it after the expiration date is of utmost importance and importance to the vital interests of tens of thousands of residents in Hong Kong. According to semi-official sources, the war zones in China are still raging, and those who have fled to Hong Kong will not be able to leave Hong Kong for the time being. During this extraordinary period, the seriousness of the housing problem in Hong Kong will continue to exist. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is now considering extending the validity of the ordinance to banish evicted servants and prevent rent increases for another year, so as to prevent disputes between tenants and landlords from becoming serious again. For the sake of the legitimate interests of tens of thousands of tenants, it is hoped that the Hong Kong government will extend the ordinance at the time.</p>

<h3>The Hong Kong Literary and Art Circles Celebrated the First Anniversary of the National Literary Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>And the Establishment of a Liaison Office for Members Remaining in Hong Kong</p>
<p>It was exactly a year ago today that the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles was established in Wuhan with a brand new outlook. All "preconceived notions," "factions," and "friction"... were also under the urgent demand of the "united front." Like scattered wind and clouds, like melted spring snow. This unprecedented great unity is sufficient to show that cultural figures have shouldered the tasks assigned by the great era and stood on the sacred position to exert the great role of the pen.</p>
<p>Although happy to stay, the work of the National Literary Association accompanying the new capital has become more active; the branches or liaison offices in various places have also been more widely developed due to the development of the current anti-Japanese situation. Yesterday, the members of the Literary Association remaining in Hong Kong and the literary and art circles in Hong Kong specially held a meeting to celebrate the anniversary of the National Literary Association, and at the same time established a liaison office for members remaining in Hong Kong. There is no need to set it as a glorious historical record of a member with a profound meaning of the electricity bill before matching the objective environment.</p>
<p>At two o'clock yesterday afternoon, it was a sunny day with a spring feeling after the overcast. Mr. Liang Gongchuo, Xu Dishan, Ma Jian, Fei Mu, Chen Hengzhe, Ye Lingfeng, Liu Simu, Ma Guoliang... all attended the meeting. Mr. Xu Shiying, Jian Youwen, Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin and other gentlemen were unable to attend due to obstruction, but they also sent representatives to attend. A gathering of talents, sincere and supportive, this is the first time that cultural people have come to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Although it was because there were too many attendees, the chairman did not have time to introduce them, but everyone quietly flipped through the sign-in book, secretly talking about who this is and who that is.</p>
<p>After the meeting ended, there were three or five groups of greetings and reminiscing. After silently reading, Mr. Xu Dishan delivered a speech. Mr. Xu's enthusiasm is deeply admired by colleagues.</p>
<p>Next, Chairman Ye Gongchuo, with the demeanor of an elder, calmly elaborated on a series of high-level discussions. He encouraged everyone to work hard to meet the needs of the times by "replacing dead literature with living literature" and "replacing static literature with dynamic literature."</p>
<p>When the master of ceremonies shouted "Report on the preparations," Mr. Lou Shiyi used his Mandarin, which had a quite northern flavor, to report on the preparations for the Hong Kong Literary Association liaison office, and incidentally reported on the work dynamics of the General Association in the front and rear in the past year. Men of letters are also fighters; the pen and the gun are equally important. The naked facts have already given us a concrete explanation. Finally, he also said: Although the format of the venue does not have slogans, national flags, or the Prime Minister's portrait, the motherland we remember and the work we will practice in the future are deeply engraved in the minds of each of us.</p>
<p>After the presidium reported the telegram from the Chongqing General Association, Wang Dashui gave a speech on behalf of Mr. Xu Shiying. Then, Mr. Xu Dishan invited Ms. Chen Hengzhe to the stage, which particularly attracted the attention of the audience. Mr. Chen, who had been admired for a long time in the "Independent Review" in Peking for "Save the Middle School Students," originally had a "antique" large lace border inlaid on her black long coat, which was quite special. After criticizing anti-Japanese literature and non-anti-Japanese literature, she also put forward the proposition that literature should be authentic.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Simu said: The progress of the Hong Kong literary and art circles is a gratifying phenomenon. In the future, we must make good use of our pens to fight against the capitulation theory of traitors and defeatists. I hope that after the establishment of this association: (1) improve the level of anti-Japanese literature; (2) literary work should be closely related to the masses; (3) Hong Kong, as a transportation hub, should communicate with Chinese and foreign cultural circles and introduce each other.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the speech program was turned over. After passing the declaration and congratulatory telegram to the General Association, the proposal was discussed.</p>
<p>First, the organization of the executive committee was discussed, which took a lot of time. As a result, a fellow member suggested a concrete method to be handled by the new board of directors, which was very neat. Regarding the case of holding a newsletter; the case of organizing a literary and art transportation station to expand international propaganda; the case of holding a literary and art evening party and the case of regularly holding external literary and art evening parties; all have been carefully discussed.</p>
<p>After the discussion, the necessary article was the election. As a result, the following people were selected as directors: Xu Dishan, Ouyang Yuqian, Lou Shiyi, Cai Chusheng, Dai Wangshu, Ye Junfeng, Chen Hengzhe, Liu Simu. Lu and Lin and other nine people. The alternate directors are Wu Jingsong and Jian Youwen. Needless to say, we have unlimited hopes for the new directors.</p>
<p>Finally, the presidium invited everyone to drink "tea" but there was no "dim sum", which was quite interesting. It is right to reduce life for the sake of resisting Japan; in the current society, mental workers who are exploited are not worthy of enjoyment. It is thought-provoking for poor men of letters to drink a cup of clear tea!</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting is over. May everyone work closely together, under the literary and artistic united front, so that the work that has been called for for a long time can be turned over lesson by lesson, until Hong Kong bears the fruits of new culture, and we can meet our partners in the restored motherland.</p>

<h3>The Street Newspaper Vendor Wandering on the Streets Lives by Begging for a Living in the Cold Wind and Bitter Rain</h3>
<p>There is still so much morning light before dawn. Young masters and young ladies who are pampered, at this time, although they will wake up from their dreams, but after a while, seeing that it is still dark outside the window, and the cold wind is desperately trying to drill in from the window cracks, they will realize that they should look for a good dream again, and drill deeper into the quilt, and soon fall asleep again. However, at this time, the time is about four o'clock in the morning, the tea house has just opened for business, and the crisp cries of selling newspapers have been intermittently hitting our eardrums! That's right, if you are not familiar with the things here, follow the crisp cries and look over, and you will see a group of children selling newspapers—the oldest is no more than fourteen or fifteen years old, and the youngest is only seven or eight years old—their appearance will cause your surprise: they have not reached the age of work, so early, so cold, ah, poor children!</p>
<p>From four o'clock in the morning to nine or ten o'clock, it is the tense time for this group of children to peddle morning newspapers. Between two and six o'clock in the afternoon, they have to find customers for the evening newspapers. After six o'clock, they still don't have leisure, but they still have to put the remaining morning and evening newspapers, several copies together, and do the work of devaluing and selling them, and only after nine o'clock can they have a chance to rest.</p>
<p>From four o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the afternoon, the footprints of these children are all over every corner of Hong Kong. Because all the newspaper offices are concentrated in the central district, around two o'clock in the morning, they ran from every corner of Hong Kong to the central district, waiting patiently for the publication of the newspaper, so they are not afraid of missing the early market. The cold wind will not pity these poor children. On the calm streets, it still roars like a tiger. Therefore, the panting that the newspaper-selling children are running to send out is all covered by the roaring wind, and cannot be heard. Run, run, they are rushing urgently!</p>
<p>Although in the embrace of the cold wind, the body wrapped in ragged clothes still has the smell of sweat. The road is long and running is stubborn. Maybe they will take off that ill-fitting coat—just that tattered Western coat—and continue to run to their destination. They are in groups of three or five. Although there is no formal contact, they are all very familiar partners. On the way, they chatted intermittently, talking about yesterday's business. When they were proud, they would also laugh loudly, breaking through the silence of the quiet, ice-like morning. When they arrived at the central location for newspaper distribution, if it was a little early, they would lie on the ground for a while. The older ones would take advantage of this free time to gamble, and it was not uncommon for them to lose all the money for buying newspapers.</p>
<p>From four o'clock to seven o'clock in the morning, they are relatively free to peddle around. At this time, they will not be suddenly caught by the police and taken to the police station, nor do they have to guard against those vehicles without eyes, and customers are more numerous and orderly than at other times.</p>
<p>Recently, new newspapers often appear in Hong Kong. In the first few days of publication, the price of distribution is very cheap. When they encounter such an opportunity, the newspaper-selling children are particularly excited. They will use various skilled methods to arouse the interest of the general public in this new publication. Because the cost is low, their income will also increase accordingly. As for ordinary old newspapers, they also have 30% to 40% of the profit to be made. However, the number of newspaper-selling children is increasing day by day, so their daily income is really very small. Although it is so difficult, they still have to continue to do it. Otherwise, even this small profit will not be available, which is terrible!</p>
<p>If we slip through the streets, we can often see them being caught by the police, with tears on their faces begging bitterly to release them, which always makes you feel sad and resentful. These poor children, driven by life, regardless of the roaring cold wind, torrential rain, and scorching sun, always tirelessly do what they can. If they should abide by the law, then society should be responsible for giving them the opportunity to abide by the law. It is not possible to fundamentally solve the problem by sending them to the police station and giving them "punishment"!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, their age is between seven and fifteen years old, so they are all children who have reached school age. Shouldn't society also be responsible for giving them the opportunity to be educated? (New)</p>

<h3>The Northern Road is Under the Control of Our Army, Communication from Huajian × is Cut Off, × Urgently Seeks to Advance North to Disturb and Intensify Preparations for Coercion, Our Guerrilla Teams Go Out Day and Night to Attack × and Destroy Engineering Works</h3>
<p>[Beijiang Express News] According to Yue × Army, recently, they have been transferred north to increase defense on the front lines of Conghua, Zengcheng, and Huaxian, and are actively deploying to plot a northern invasion. The strength of our northern road defense army has greatly increased since the military authorities transferred the mechanized new army to the south for combat. It has a considerable grasp of monitoring and controlling the northern line. The following is a record of recent military information.</p>
<p>Conghua Front Line × Military Movements</p>
<p>According to front-line military information, × troops stationed in Shengang Taipingchang on the Conghua front line have been dispatching infantry and cavalry to invade our warning line in recent days, and have also been disturbing villages in the nearby area, forcing the people to search for cedar, bamboo, and wood to build pontoon bridges and make wooden rafts in preparation for crossing the river, and forcibly requisitioning dozens of civilian ships, which are docked at Shengang and Taipingchang on the Luotan River surface, with intentions. At the airport opened by Dapu ×, several miles away from Taipingchang, there are currently seven or eight × planes stationed, which fly to Conghua, Huaxian, Longmen, Zengcheng and other places every day for reconnaissance. Looking at the overall military movements of ×, there will be plots.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Teams Expand Attacks on ×</p>
<p>It is found that Wu Guandian, commander of the Second Guerrilla Column, ordered the various departments of the team to expand their activities and cut off the connection between × troops in Cong (hua) and Hua (xian) in order to contain the activities of the × troops and assist our army in the attack. Therefore, our guerrillas have been going out day and night to attack × and destroy × affairs, which is very successful. × feels difficult to cope with. On the 22nd of this month, a certain part of our guerrillas lurking in Honghe Yue attacked the × battalion near Taipingchang, and once advanced into the × formation, bombing the × fortifications and killing a dozen × sentries. × is now in a state of panic and is stepping up vigilance in various villages.</p>
<p>Anti-Army Two Routes Counterattack Shengang</p>
<p>According to military news, our new-style mechanized troops have consolidated their defense and boosted their morale since they opened up Beijiang to increase defense. The Liang Division troops of the 12th Army Group, which is responsible for fighting on the Conghua front, have repelled the × troops who have repeatedly attacked the troops and have taken advantage of the situation to advance to Shengang in two routes from Dagang Ridge Zuihe Market. The vanguard team has had a front-line encounter with ×, and the war is likely to continue to unfold. Therefore, the military affairs of the northern road, which have been silent for many days, will have a new development.</p>
<h3>× Increases Troops to Sanjiang, Intending to Spy on Lubao, Our Suppression of the Activity of × Boats in Xiaobeijiang, × Artillery Bombards Mafang in Langang, We Suffer No Losses</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Express News] Our × in Xijiang is still confronting each other in the original positions. Although × has repeatedly increased reinforcements to the Sanshui front line and sent troops to cross the river to occupy Ge Wei and spy on our alert positions, they are only probing in nature. In the past week, the entire Xijiang war situation, except for intermittent cross-river artillery battles and small encounters in the front posts, has been without major battles. However, in the past two days, × has increased troops to the Luxi Highway, the 43 Highway, and the Tan Highway, seemingly with new intentions. The following is a record of the situation.</p>
<p>× Still Increases Troops, Trying to Spy on Lubao</p>
<p>In the past ten days, in the various strongholds on the Sanshui front line, the × army has made no other changes except for actively deploying defenses. Only on the two highways of Lubao) Xi (nan) and Si (hui) San (shui) have × military transports been very busy in recent days. × troops increased defense to Sanjiang, Guanyao, Fengyong, and Yangmei along these highways from Southwest and Hekou. According to intelligence, × seems to have the intention of spying on Fanhu and Lubao. On the 23rd, in Langang, × artillery fired remotely on our Mafang position, reaching more than 30 rounds. However, most of the shells fell into the wilderness, and the defending troops of our position ignored them, and only waited in formation.</p>
<p>We Strictly Seal off Xiaobeijiang</p>
<p>According to intelligence received by the military authorities, × on the Xijiang River intended to spy on Lubao along Xiaobeijiang and by land and water from the highway to coordinate the × army's advance on the front of the Xijiang River. Furthermore, now is the spring season and the river water is rising sharply, fearing that × boats will take the opportunity to go north along the river. In order to strictly prevent and control, the front-line corps was ordered to choose a location to strictly lock Xiaobeijiang. It was found that the river surface near Shijiao, Qingyuan County, was sealed off by the authorities when Sanshui was first captured. Later, due to the sharp increase in refugees in the lower reaches of Lubao, the river was sealed off, which affected the water transportation of commercial goods for relief. A small road was opened in the blockade line to facilitate the passage of ships. In order to prevent × military ships from being active along the river, it was decided to strengthen the blockade line, and strictly set the time for opening and allowing ships to pass, to prevent × people from rushing in. The General Tax Department and the headquarters of the Second Guerrilla Column each sent troops to defend and guard the Mei Cai and Mei Ling areas along the river and the Shi Yi area to meet × Kou.</p>
<p>Our Troops in Mafang Are Waiting for Orders to Attack</p>
<p>It was also found that Mafang (belonging to Sihui) and Lubao (belonging to Sanshui) in the lower reaches of Xiaobeijiang have become the foremost front lines of the Northwest River, and have been guarded by the regular army of the Tax Police Corps and ×× and other departments. Since Deng Longguang, commander of the 64th Army, patrolled the front line yesterday, he has been more actively deploying and strengthening military affairs in that area. A strong formation has now been deployed to smash ×'s conspiracy to spy, and to seize the opportunity to counterattack ×. It was found that our troops in Lubao Mafang had crossed the river several times to attack the × army in Langang Mumian and other places. Later, due to the overall strategic relationship, they did not obtain close contact with the main army of each department, and still retreated to the original defense. According to military news, General Deng Longguang, who is in charge of the military affairs of the western road, has ordered the front-line corps to make strict preparations and wait for orders to attack, as ×'s ambition to invade the west is still urgent.</p>
<h3>Four × Planes Bombarded Shantou Madly the Day Before Yesterday, the Station and Yongtai Shengping Roads Were Hit, Yaoming Village Was Destroyed, More Than 200 Civilians Were Killed or Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Shantou merchants in Hong Kong received telegrams one after another, saying that × planes bombed Shantou on a large scale yesterday morning, and the losses were quite heavy. The reporter then asked a Chaozhou merchant, who said that this time × plotted to invade the south, following the landing at Jinmen. Later, on July 3 and 11 last year, × planes were repeatedly sent to bomb Shantou wildly, and the disaster was heavy. Later, they landed in Nan'ao, and after our guerrillas and regular army jointly attacked, they recovered the lost land. × was frightened, and dared not invade since then. Shantou has been peaceful for several months. Unexpectedly, this afternoon (25th), this firm received a telegram from Shantou saying that × planes bombed the train and Shengping Road. It was found that the purpose of this bombing of Shantou by × planes was to bomb the Chaoshan Road car, because the bombing time happened to be the time when the Chaoan car arrived in Shantou. It is said that four × planes invaded the most prosperous area of Shantou and bombed it at 9:00 yesterday morning. Many bombs were dropped at the intersection of Yongtai Road and Shengping Road, and bombs were also dropped near the seaside. The area where the boats gather is the hub of Shantou's land and water transportation. The place is extremely prosperous. Although the loss of property and life in this bombing has not been accurately statistically, it is estimated that it is extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>Proclamation by the Guangdong-Min-Gan Border District Commissioner's Office: Banning Impersonating Guerrilla Teams</h3>
<p>[Chaoan Express News] Wu Qiwai, Commander-in-Chief of the 9th Army Group, was recently appointed as the Director of the Gan-Yue-Min Border District, responsible for commanding the troops in the border areas of the three provinces, pacifying the war of resistance, and stabilizing the anti-Japanese situation. Wu recently issued a proclamation to ban the border areas of Guangdong, Min, and Gan, where bandits and bandits often impersonated anti-Japanese self-defense organizations and guerrilla teams, disturbing and plundering the villagers, which has a great impact on wartime defense and public security. The original text is as follows: In view of the war of resistance against Japan, which is related to the survival of the nation, all soldiers and civilians should know how to unite as one and overcome difficulties together. Although the people in the rear cannot all go to the battlefield to defend the country with weapons, they should also be united in mind and one in virtue, and hate the enemy with the same hatred, so that the front line has no worries and the war of resistance has the hope of winning. However, it is found that in the borders of Gan, Yue, and Min, there are still those who do not understand righteousness. They take advantage of the name of guerrilla warfare to resist Japan, and secretly engage in the practice of planting parties and seeking private interests, gathering disciples to fish and meat the villagers, stripping taxes and donations, covering up smoke and gambling, and the thorny road is painful to say. If they are not strictly investigated, how can we maintain public security and revitalize discipline? Only thinking that there are those who have the heart to resist Japan, and there is no way to ask for help, and there are those who are forced to take risks due to different opinions with the authorities, and the general public is moved by the wrong propaganda, does not understand the illegality of the organization, and covets temporary convenience to avoid the ease of military service. All these kinds of things, although the traces are unforgivable, but the feelings are worthy of pity. This Acting Director returned from Nantao, and was about to feed his horses and sharpen his soldiers to return to the front line, but he had to make a sincere persuasion out of the desire to solve the problem of public security in the north. All the people in the border areas of the three provinces, those who have armed organizations and claim to be heroes, unless they are approved by the county government, should be canceled regardless of their name, and should be submitted to the office for self-renewal within days after the proclamation to wait for compilation and transformation, and to protect vitality. If they are obsessed with ignorance, disobey orders, and violate them secretly, they will be severely suppressed once they are investigated. This Acting Director speaks the law, and I hope that enlightened people know where to go, whether to be guilty or meritorious, it is a matter of time, and I sincerely tell you to come back early, and there are great hopes.</p>
<h3>× Is Trapped in the Mire in Xijiang and Has No Ability to Invade. Building Defensive Works Only to Conserve, Forcing Villagers to Relocate and Build Forts</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Special News] It has been almost a month since the commander of the × army in Xijiang was replaced. They have repeatedly claimed to attack, but they have never dared to cross the Leichi Pool. Therefore, in fact, they have no ability to invade and are deeply trapped in the mire and cannot extricate themselves. The following is a record of the recent × situation.</p>
<p>Intensifying the Construction of Defensive Works</p>
<p>After the × chief Zhongyuan commander arrived in Sanshui, he transferred the troops along the line of Sanshui, Hekou, Southwest, and Jiujiang, and outsiders who did not know it thought that the × army was increasing its troops to Xijiang. In fact, the × army in Xijiang was already in the deepest mire. Because our regular main force is strengthening its defensive power in the upper reaches of West Port, and is preparing to counterattack, and the × in the lower reaches are also attacked by our guerrillas everywhere. Not only can they not be extended, but they are also afraid of our army's attack. Therefore, the × in Sanshui intensified the establishment of various defensive works. It was found that the × being planned was to build a pontoon bridge on Laoya Island in Hekou. The east bank of the bridge is bounded by the Beijiang Estuary, and two additional three-in-one earth bunkers are built to defend with small steel cannons and machine guns. On the left flank, × in Makou Gang Genjiaowei and Mumian, as well as the Ni River, were equipped with a total of more than 600 people of various arms to confront Jinli I across the river. On the 20th of this month, more than 300 villagers were seized in Xinxu and a military road was built from Ganggenxu to Dalu Xu, which was prepared to connect to the Jiujiang Highway, and its left was prepared to connect to the Southwest Highway. About 100 × in Ganggen had two cannons. The × battalion commander Lin Mao, stationed there, ordered the villagers' residences in Chaowan and Ganggen to be demolished within ten days, otherwise they would be set on fire. They also forced the villagers of the two villages to move to Saikeng and Qinkeng, and prepared to build military barracks and forts in the roots of Chaowan, and open them as small military ports on the banks of the two villages. Therefore, the engineering is unusually busy there.</p>
<p>Bolting Wood and Horse Mouth, a Military Road Is Built</p>
<p>Also, the military road from Baimu Market to Makou was opened to traffic on the 23rd of this month, and will be connected to Jiujiang in the future to connect in one go. On that day, three × transport vehicles transported a lot of grain and military supplies from Baimu to Makou. There are also several rubber boats that have sailed to Makou, the dynamics are unknown. On the right wing, ×, from the old Sanshui Xinxu along the east bank of the river, has added four or five bunkers and built machine gun bunkers along the coast, adding a lot of barbed wire, fearing our army's river crossing counterattack. The above view of × army strengthening its defensive power in this way shows that it only intends to conserve strongholds and has no ability to invade Xijiang.</p>
<h3>Using the Rear as the Front: The Number of Our Guerrillas in Guangzhou is Astonishing; Warning to Pro-*** Restaurants and Teahouses; *** Can't Get Started on Census Taking</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou Correspondence] The current state of Guangzhou's public security is worsening recently. On the one hand, it is because ***'s puppet regime is unable to govern effectively. On the other hand, it is due to our guerrillas spreading in and out of the urban area, leaving the *** people at a loss. According to reliable sources, from the city to the suburbs, the number of our guerrillas hiding is indeed astonishing, estimated to be no less than 50,000. Among them, in addition to the strong men from the suburbs and various villages in Nanhai and Panyu counties, many from as far as Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Conghua counties have also been dispatched or have voluntarily entered Guangzhou to work secretly and seize opportunities to attack ***. The attack on the Zhengjin Bank last month was a manifestation of the coordinated action of guerrillas from various counties in Guangzhou. Moreover, the firearms are modern and the ammunition is sufficient, as demonstrated by the above-mentioned battle. Each attack leaves the scattered and small *** forces unable to resist, effectively using the ***'s rear as the front. They do not launch lightly in normal times, but each launch must have a major purpose, and they will not rest until it is achieved. True popular armed forces have grown under the claws of the ***, and the organization is becoming increasingly large, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Warning to Pro-*** Restaurants</p>
<p>It has been found that the restaurants that have reopened in Guangzhou include Da San Yuan, Jinlong, Qi Miao Zhai (formerly known as Ming Yuan), and Jinlun. They were forced to reopen by the *** army, otherwise they would be confiscated by the *** and operated by themselves. However, there are some unscrupulous merchants who have even opened large "China Cuisine" restaurants and loudly speak *** language, claiming to welcome the "Imperial Revolution." Inside, they employ a group of *** women as receptionists. Our guerrillas recently warned the investors of these restaurants, and the bosses were panicked and asked the *** Command Headquarters for protection. The *** dispatched plainclothes detectives from the puppet police force to go there. The restaurants are even more panicked, knowing that these secret agents are all bandits, offering more harassment than protection.</p>
<p>Unable to Conduct Census</p>
<p>The *** army is extremely anxious about the growing number of hidden guerrilla forces. They have consulted with the puppet organization and proposed conducting a census. However, they feel that the number of *** soldiers and puppets is not large enough to conduct a large-scale census at the same time. People would scatter in all directions, and they even worry that our guerrillas will strike first. There is also the matter that the *** is trying hard to attract people from all over to return to the city, using the slogan "live and work in peace." They fear that a census will cause unrest in the urban area, which would make people even more wary. All of these are concerns that the *** have but cannot resolve. This news was leaked by people from the puppet organization. The matter should be credible, otherwise the *** would not need to try so hard to cover up the Zhengjin Bank attack. In short, the strength of our guerrillas has continued to grow under these inevitable circumstances and will be brought into play sooner or later, making the *** unable to sleep peacefully. The reason is very clear.</p>
<h3>Our Guerrillas on the Coastal Line Launch a Surprise Attack on Xiuying Fort, Killing Dozens of *** and Destroying Two Camps</h3>
<p>[Beihai Special Dispatch] This station received news from Haikou. After our army's counterattack on Qiongshan, last night (the 22nd), the Haikou local self-defense corps launched a large-scale offensive towards Haikou again and once attacked the Xiuying Fort. It was late at night, and the *** army did not know how many troops we had and dared not fight back. They defended their camps, but our forces set fire and burned two *** camps, killing dozens of ***. The battle continued until dawn, when our forces retreated.</p>
<h3>Special Shipping Report</h3>
<p>The Guangfu Xiang ship of the Mingsheng Company left the port yesterday and is now operating normally between Hong Kong and Macau.

<h3>Star Publicity Tactics: A Motley Collection</h3>
<p>Charles Boyer said, "Actors are abnormal people. If we were normal people, we would not be actors."</p>
<p>Actors are indeed different from ordinary people in many ways. For the convenience of publicity work, they often deliberately do some peculiar things to show their unique personality. Otherwise, it is difficult for them to find publicity materials, and it is crucial to maintain their reputation. Whether the publicity is effective or not is a big key... Look, the most beautiful women and the most handsome men in Hollywood are not famous movie stars, but extras. It is because they do not get a publicity opportunity. As long as someone publicizes him or her, it is not difficult to step onto the throne of a star.</p>
<p>When Hedy Lamarr first arrived in Hollywood, she had the same captivating characteristics as she does now. However, she was forgotten for several months until the newspapers started promoting her, and then she gradually rose to her current position.</p>
<p>Although every actor's success story does not attribute his success to the power of publicity, we all know that publicity work is to a movie actor as air is to a person. It is indispensable for a day, otherwise—maybe they admit this is true—they would not often do those special things.</p>
<p>For example, in mid-September, Martha Raye stated in San Francisco that she would marry Buddy West. At the same time, she said that they would hold a formal wedding, but it did not need to be a grand one. She added, "I don't need publicity, I just want to get married."</p>
<p>To put her words into practice, she did not marry in Hollywood but in Ensenada, where it was quieter. People believed that she was truly escaping publicity work, but few people knew one thing...</p>
<p>The day before she left, a Mexican-style set was set up in the Paramount studio. The new couple walked in hand-in-hand from outside the door, with new wedding smiles on their faces. At the same time, the camera rang, recording it all in the lens. This was just a rehearsal, but the publicity purpose had already been achieved. When played, it would surely attract attention.</p>
<p>Ordinary men and women always want to keep their marriage as secret as possible, but here it is the opposite, flaunting it, fearing that people will not know. Indeed, such a secret marriage has a greater publicity effect than holding a grand wedding.</p>
<p>Henry Wilcoxon and Joan Woodbury did not seem to understand this. They held a wedding in the chapel in full dress in front of relatives and friends. Their wedding only occupied one line in the newspaper the next day, which was very pitiful. If they understood a little, they would have rushed to Yuma to get married, and it would not have been so tragic. Look at Jack Oakie and Venita Varden, who got married in Yuma during the short 15-minute stop of a train. This achieved great publicity effect. At the same time, it secretly advertised part of Jack's new movie "Florida Limited", in which there is a train as the background.</p>
<p>Laurel is also weird enough. He is busy entertaining guests all year round, either separating from his wife Illeana or reconciling as before. He may even get married again. They have been married three times. The last time, Laurel said an immortal amazing sentence, "This is also a good excuse to entertain guests."</p>
<p>Once, Illeana violated the driving regulations and was detained for nine hours. Not only did the photographers take pictures of her kissing Laurel after she came out, but they also took pictures of the anxious husband sitting on the steps in front of the prison door with his eyes wide open waiting for his wife.</p>
<p>The newspaper revealed mercilessly the stories of their separation and reunion, which was exactly what he wanted. The funny Laurel gained interesting publicity effect.</p>
<p>According to Carole Lombard, her income in 1937 was $465,000, but the actual amount she could get was only $20,000. The income tax was $297,575, which accounted for a large part. Recently, when someone asked her about her feelings about income tax, did she complain? No, she made a grand speech with great enthusiasm, saying that,</p>
<p>"Twenty thousand dollars is already enough. It is a good thing to contribute most of my income to the government. I will definitely not spend this large sum of $465,000 a year. Why not contribute the money that I can't spend to the government? This is the most legitimate way to spend it. And if there was no such a huge income tax, maybe my income would not be so high. Salaries follow income tax, and if there was no income tax at all, maybe I would not have $20,000 a year."</p>
<p>These words are very beautiful, aren't they? But according to others' estimates, the amount of tax she said was a bit exaggerated. But what made her say these words? Very easy, these words can make people think of her new movie.</p>
<p>Publicity cannot encourage female stars to have children, but it can use her, like Dorothy Lamour. Her lawyer formally notified the company that on her 25th birthday, she would retire from the film industry for a year in order to have a child. This sentence disturbed a lot of people's hearing. Someone advised her to adopt a child. She replied,</p>
<p>"I want a child of my own, not someone else's. I think every married woman should have her own child. This is a responsibility, and I hope to have one before my 25th birthday. In this way, when my child grows up, I can still be very young."</p>
<p>Her 24th birthday passed last December 10th. She is still busy filming at Paramount. Her publicist should be a very smart person.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich was known as having the most beautiful legs in Hollywood in the past few years, but at that time she preferred to wear men's clothes and long pants, hiding them away. Later, I don't know when, she gave it up. Long pants are no longer her symbol. Only those who are not very healthy should wear them. The current Dietrich seems to be reminding fans not to forget that her legs are still healthy enough.</p>
<p>After Jean Harlow died, William Powell was very sad. He collected a sum of money dedicated to flowers on her grave. This affectionate move touched many people... Recently, another story came out that Antra Līdze also sends flowers to Jacques—Sonja Henie's skating partner—who died not long ago every day. This story is obviously a bit different. If she had not left a few months before he died and was not currently having a good time with her boyfriend in a nightclub, would this story not be more like the truth?</p>
<p>George Raft's "publicity history" is the most abundant. When he first entered the film industry, he claimed to have taught the then Prince of Wales tango. Later, the Prince ascended the throne and became Edward VIII. This made the publicity even more powerful. After Edward VIII abdicated, George invited him to Hollywood. Whether he came or not is another matter. Like last year, George invited a child—whose mother was sentenced to death for murder—to his home for Christmas—but the boy did not come. But what does it matter? Anyway, George has made enough headlines in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn's words are a bit like "dreaming with his nose pinched". When he first came to Hollywood, he talked wildly about his past adventures, which confused many people. After a while, his stomach was empty, so he changed his direction and talked about his future exploration plans. If you completely believe his words, you are a big fool.</p>
<p>For female stars, half-nakedness and narrow clothes are still the best publicity methods. For the former, Claudette Colbert, Merle Oberon, and Ann Sheridan are competing to show their strangeness. For the latter, after watching Norma Shearer's early movies, it is undoubtedly clear that she occupies the first place.</p>
<p>Even Hedda Hopper, who has always been considered the most humorous in Hollywood, is also using half-naked costumes for publicity.</p>

<h3>Nearly 10,000 Fans Watch the Battle: Chinese League Wins the Lai Wah Cup, Defeating the Western Civil Servants' League 4-2</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Special Report] Yesterday was a holiday, and the fans were all very happy. As soon as 3:00 PM arrived, the Hong Kong Football Club stadium was seen to be full of guests, "business booming". The old men of the General Association were beaming, secretly grateful to the heavens for making it so beautiful. But I don't know if they will be grateful to the 99% Chinese customers, who spare no expense and gather into a pool, thereby obtaining a huge profit.</p>
<p>The ticket income of $2,903, although not the highest record in this season, the fact that Hong Kong's football movement has "resumed prosperity" is a fact.</p>
<p>I think, the country is in great difficulty, and every ordinary person has a responsibility. We "flee into paradise", but we must not forget our motherland. Sir Zhou Shouchen once said that he has been persuading people in Hong Kong to sell $10 million in national salvation bonds, but it is still not enough. What is the reason for this? If people bought bonds as enthusiastically as they watched football games, I believe the results would be better.</p>
<p>Let's put aside the digressions and get back to the main topic. Speaking of this football event, it was the final of the Lai Wah Cup. Winning is very important, so it was so lively and turned the world upside down. If this final did not have a Chinese League team competing in it, and there was no "Oriental Standard Footballer Li Huitang appearing, it would not be so "popular". How prosperous, Hong Kong football!</p>
<p>The Chinese League lacked Song Lingsheng. This boy's ankle injury has not fully recovered. It's not because he retreated before the battle, but because Zeng Zhongyun was used to replace him, forming a lineup similar to last week's International Cup semi-final.</p>
<p>The Western Civil Servants' League had a lot of changes. Gao Shannu was tired of his duties. Perry, O'Neill, George, Liao Yachen, etc. were also absent due to foot injuries. Faria did not know where he went. Four reserves were temporarily used to make up for the lack of numbers, and they had to invite that nameless and clumsy Pratley to play as the right inside forward to make up a lineup. This footballer, who has no relationship with each other, seems to have very mediocre skills, like "he can't be put on the table". But I don't know what he did in his previous lives to be able to appear in this game and be on par with the generals, and he even scored a goal. I really envy him for being lucky. "Mediocre people have their own mediocre blessings". When Pratley was invited, he was first listed on the list, and then the football experience was discussed.</p>
<p>(Chinese League Team)</p>
<p>Tan Junkun (South China)</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng (South Nam)</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua)</p>
<p>Jing Cheng (Eastern)</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao (South Nam)</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongyun (Eastern)</p>
<p>Hou Chengtang (Eastern) Rong (South Nam)</p>
<p>Li Huitang (South Nam)</p>
<p>Feng Jingxiang (South Nam)</p>
<p>Deng Guangsen (South China)</p>
<p>(Western Civil Servants)</p>
<p>Gollos (Hong Kong Club)</p>
<p>Pugger (Police)</p>
<p>Blackburn (Police)</p>
<p>Heninborg (Marulong)</p>
<p>Harrison (Joseph)</p>
<p>Norf (Police)</p>
<p>Morse (Police)</p>
<p>Pratley (Police) Leonard (Joseph)</p>
<p>Easttrange (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Di Pallo (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Looking at the above two lineups, it is clear who is stronger and who is weaker. Therefore, it is right for the Chinese League to win and win the championship. But we did not expect that the Western team, whose personnel changed greatly, had many good performances, which surprised the spectators.</p>
<p>Yesterday I said, "Pugger plays inside defense, the most cunning, often attacking and causing the opponent's forward to be offside. Therefore, Huitang must beware of the traps set by Pugger when advancing from the middle. "Sure enough, Pugger used this trick again. Although experienced as Huitang, he was still trapped several times. Not to mention Hou Chengtang, who is accustomed to being offside.</p>
<p>Pugger's positional warfare is indeed skillful, and Blackburn, who is in harmony with him, is also an expert. Therefore, the two performed together, showing their skills. The Western team did not lose too much, thanks to the efforts of these two. Harrison fixed Huitang and followed every step of the way, which can be said to be responsible. However, Huitang was still able to penetrate independently and shoot from the side, winning the fourth goal and icing on the cake. The victory situation tended to stabilize, which shows that Huitang does have the ability to reach the peak, and no one can watch him closely. However, his performance yesterday was not the best, because the field was wet and muddy. Every time he ran, he felt unstable and it was not easy to find a way out. The other members also often had a "I can't get through" sigh.</p>
<p>The foreigners' strength is generally better than ours. Moreover, in a police ball situation, the offensive side is bound to be more strenuous than the defensive side. In yesterday's battle, the Chinese League was often in an offensive position, and the purpose of the front players was of course to complete the last kick. However, the field was slippery and the ball was heavy, making progress difficult. The Western defenders relied on danger to resist, which was easy to defend. They were also strong enough and took advantage of the slippery battle. Therefore, although the Chinese League often took the offensive, it was because the triangular short pass guard, which they were good at, did not work as well as they wanted, so it was difficult to win. However, the Chinese League finally won with better skills. Although the general situation was unfavorable, they had the advantage of harmony, and each relied on skilled skills to overcome difficulties and finally win the championship.</p>
<p>The Western team was soft in the front and hard in the back, which was obviously a deformed situation. Therefore, in this situation, it was fortunate for them to avoid losing too many goals. If they wanted to win, it would be impossible without an accident. Therefore, it was their success to be able to keep the goal difference not too large.</p>
<p>The Chinese League's cone-shaped assault line failed to succeed in yesterday's battle, but the wing attack on both sides had great effect. Therefore, activities were often seen between the inside and outside wings.</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao of the forward line did the most to cover the progress of the front line. Zeng Zhongyun and Xu Jingcheng also had many good performances, but Jingcheng's ball-handling skills were still lacking. It is best to practice using the right foot more, which may make up for this shortcoming. Li Tiansheng and Hou Rongsheng, the two inside guards, were able to be skilled in their work because of the arch guard in front. Tan Junkun's second loss was quite a joke. Was it because the ball was slippery and heavy, causing him to lose his hand? Therefore, although the Chinese League won the championship, the merits and demerits must be clearly distinguished. This is also the meaning of the sages of the Spring and Autumn Period.</p>
<p>First half</p>
<p>(Eight minutes) The four players were very brave, rushing forward and attacking our position. Leonard responded in the middle and passed a wonderful pass to Di Pallo, who copied into the hinterland, raised his foot and shot. Junkun dived to save, but the ball broke out. Before Junkun could turn around, Easttrange ambushed in front of the goal and took the opportunity to break through the first pass (1-0).</p>
<p>(Thirteen minutes) The Chinese League attacked fiercely. Jingxiang and Zhaorong attacked the goal one after another, but unfortunately the ball fell out of bounds and they returned without success.</p>
<p>(Twenty-one minutes) The Western team launched a five-way attack. "Stone Boy" Yirongsheng was fierce and abnormal, driving away the uninvited guests. Zhaorong got his supply and passed it to Jingxiang. "Magic legs" dribbled the ball to the right, and Guangsen contained a coin and sprinted quickly. The "little monkey" Chengtang shot into the city like an arrow, raised his foot and dragged. Blackburn came late, and Gollos wanted to save but could not. The ball went into the net (1-1) and reached a tie.</p>
<p>(Twenty-seven minutes) Huitang shot at the goal in the enemy's formation, and Pugger blocked it out of bounds. Guangsen opened a corner kick, which was obtained by Chengtang. Because the door was blocked, there was no chance to shoot. He quickly passed it to Jingcheng. Jingcheng passed it to Rongzhao again. At this time, the Western team's guard paid attention to the Chinese League's front line, but did not expect Rongzhao to shoot from a distance. The poisonous arrow came straight and hit the bullseye, taking the lead with (2-1).</p>
<p>(Thirty-four minutes) Jingcheng saved the ball on the front line and kicked the ball diagonally. It was obtained by Morse, who fired a cannon. Junkun jumped high to catch it, but the ball fell to the ground. Pratley stepped forward and slammed into it with his waist. The ball went into the net again, making it (2-2). The viewers had complaints about Junkun's loss.</p>
<p>(Forty-four minutes) Huitang dribbled the ball quickly and advanced. Norf committed a foul and was penalized with a free kick. Rongzhao took the shot and passed it lightly to Chengtang. Blackburn and Chengtang entangled. The gesture was inadvertently, and he was penalized with a penalty kick. Huitang took the penalty and the ball went into the net, scoring another goal (3-2).</p>
<p>Second half</p>
<p>The generals of the Chinese League did not dare to delay because the victory was not stable. They fought desperately. Within 20 minutes, they forced five corner kicks in a row. Grass and trees were all soldiers under the Western team's city.</p>
<p>(Twenty-two minutes) Chengtang forced a corner kick, which was taken by Jingcheng. The ball fell in front of the goal, and Pugger headed it out with an iron head. Zhaorong followed the ball and attacked the goal quickly. Unexpectedly, he was too hasty, and the ball crossed the crossbar and fell out of bounds.</p>
<p>After that, taking advantage of the Chinese League's empty defense, Pugger passed the ball to Morse. Rong Sheng was knocked to the ground during the interception. Morse quickly passed it to Di Pallo, who was unguarded. Junkun saw that Tiansheng could not catch up and gave up the city to rescue him. He obtained the ball from Di Pallo's feet in time, and Jiangshan began to protect.</p>
<p>(Thirty-two minutes) Zhaorong lost a big chance in the counterattack. After a while, Guangsen got it on the border. He dribbled in front of him and moved forward a few steps, passing it diagonally to Huitang. In order to avoid the opponent's entanglement, Huitang went straight to the right and rushed forward. He shot a ball diagonally at the corner of the goal, which happened to be in the right place (becoming 4-2). The game ended and the Chinese League won and won the championship.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith, the Financial Secretary, personally awarded the prizes. Li Huitang, the captain of the Chinese League, received the Lai Wah Cup from the two sessions on behalf of the team, shouted three times, and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Men's Basketball Tournament: Group A Oriental Defeats Kwongta; Group B Pui Ying, Overseas Chinese Triumph; Three Games to be Held This Evening</h3>
<p>The public men's basketball tournament, the first match yesterday afternoon was Group B Hua Hsiung versus Pui Ying. Both teams are strong contenders in Group B, and their strengths were evenly matched, making the game intense. In the first half, Pui Ying took the lead with 19 to 11. In the second half, Hua Hsiung made a strong comeback, even leading by one point at one time. In the last fifteen minutes, the two sides were evenly matched, tying three times at 26-26, 28-28, and 30-30. Three minutes before the end of the game, Pui Ying scored consecutively, thus winning 38-30. In the second match, Group A Oriental versus Kwongta, the former had shown its brilliance many times in the Hong Kong basketball scene, and the strength of its lineup was admired by all. The latter also had many good players from Guangdong and Hong Kong, and its strength was also considerable. In this match, although Kwongta suffered a major defeat with 71 to 44, it had only lost by a narrow margin of 19 to 20 in the preliminary round. Until the end of the first half, it was still closely following with 19 to 24. However, after the start of the second half, it suffered a complete collapse, resulting in a one-sided situation. The reason for the disastrous defeat was purely due to the ineffective defense of the two guards, repeatedly falling into the opponent's trap. Every time Oriental's Fung Nim-wah, Tsui Hang, and Wong Ting-fan attacked, they formed a triangular formation, using their fast passing and flexible positioning, and winning with the feint of attacking from the east and striking from the west, making Kwongta's Leung and Ng guards fall into their trap, busy with defense. Unexpectedly, Oriental had already flown in from the sky and rushed straight to the basket, calmly shooting in. Kwongta's players' inaccurate shooting and lack of composure were also fatal flaws. Later, adopting long-range shooting methods was even more of a miscalculation. Regarding Oriental's victory, Fung Nim-wah deserves the most credit, scoring 14 goals himself, with excellent shooting and interception. Tsui Hang's overall performance was also brilliant. The other players all fulfilled their duties. As for Kwongta's forwards and guards, although they had considerable talent, they had not yet reached the stage of perfection, resulting in the entire team failing to launch a surprising and victorious strategy, undoubtedly losing due to inferior skills. However, the strategic failure is also undeniable.</p>
<p>In this match, apart from Kwongta's Leung Kit-fu opening the scoring with the first goal, Oriental dominated afterwards. Tsui Hang, Nim-wah, and Wong Ting-fan scored successively, making the score 10 to 7. It was not until Leung Kit-fu, Leung Kong-keung, and Lo Tung broke through the defenses that the score was forced into a situation of 10 to 10 and 19 to 14. Afterwards, the two sides competed fiercely. Until the end of the first half, Oriental only led by 24 to 19. Switching sides and fighting again, Kwongta's defense was in urgent need. Tsui Hang took advantage of a counterattack, making the score 32 to 23. When Yuen Yi-chiu fouled out, Kwongta's defense became even more vulnerable. Oriental successively broke through Kwongta's entire formation with 41 to 35 and 57 to 37. Although Kwongta's Leung and Cheng forwards occasionally shot, Oriental's Tsui also responded in kind. However, until the end of the game, Oriental won by a large margin of 73 to 44. In the last match, Group B Overseas Chinese versus Hung Chi, the strength of the two teams was disparate, and the outcome was predictable. The battle gradually became one-sided, and as a result, Overseas Chinese won by a large margin of 70 to 16.</p>

<h3>Semi-Stagnation, Transportation Difficulties, High Timber Prices, Export Trade Reduced by 40%</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong camphor wood industry has always been stable and its business has been quite developed. In terms of Hong Kong's foreign trade, this industry also occupies an important position. The average annual export value is approximately over 770,000. According to a survey, there are no less than 50 camphor wood shops of various sizes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The main source of camphor wood is the Kwangsi, Kweichow, and Yunnan area, followed by Canton and Chaochow. The price of camphor wood before the war was about 15 or 16 dollars per hundred feet. However, due to the war, transportation in various parts of the mainland has become difficult, so the price of wood has slightly increased, estimated to be about 15% per hundred feet. After the increase in wood prices, the production costs of the shops in the industry have increased. At the same time, because the price of goods cannot be increased, the business of the shops on the Hong Kong side is in a state of semi-stagnation, with an estimated reduction of about 20%. Export trade has decreased by more than 40%. The export of camphor wood is mainly to the territories of the United Kingdom and the United States, with an average of over one million dollars per year. The French and Dutch territories also account for tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3>The Two Laws for Appreciating Spectator Sports</h3>
<p>— Lo Hsia</p>
<p>Dr. Thorndike is a modern educational psychologist. Since he invented the "Three Laws of Learning," many people have used these three laws of learning to deduce many theorems and various matters. As a result, those who applied this method have achieved considerable success. Now I will use these three laws of learning to talk about the three laws of watching sports. I will let everyone know what kind of mindset one should have when watching various sports competitions.</p>
<p>(1) Law of Readiness—Whenever a game has not yet started, we should have a kind of readiness in our minds to appreciate this game. That is to say, we are not watching this game as "joining in the fun" or as "entertainment," but with a mindset of researching and testing our own observation and critical abilities. First, we should think about which team will win this game, which team will lose, and what the score difference between the winner and loser will be. We should have a preparation to predict it. Secondly, we should think about whether each player's performance this time will be successful or unsuccessful, and whether the team's passing, shooting, and communication are excellent or poor. We should also have an observation and critique. This is the law of readiness that we should have before the game starts.</p>
<p>(2) Law of Exercise, or Law of Use and Disuse—As an example of the general principle of natural selection, "Use it and it will advance to success, disuse it and it will become regression." That is to say, the more we practice watching games, the more we increase our own observational and critical skills. Conversely, if we watch fewer games, or if there are spectators who don't know how to watch games, they will misunderstand the referee's calls or misinterpret players' illegal actions, thus creating many disputes and conflicts caused by the audience. This problem is often found in Hong Kong. Most of these people do not understand the true purpose of watching games, so the second law of learning is saying that we should not just go to watch games, but should also practice watching games more often, so that we can truly gain accurate understanding and criticism.</p>
<p>(3) Law of Effect, or Law of Satisfaction and Annoyance—How do you feel after watching this game? Satisfied or annoyed? If you feel satisfied, then you will often go to watch games in the future. Just like a child gets candy for crying, then he will often cry in the future, because he will get something, which will become a habit, and with a habit, he will be satisfied. Conversely, if he doesn't get candy, he won't cry, and he will be annoyed. So, the third law of effect is the most important. We need to see good teams performing, good techniques being demonstrated, and good sportsmanship being rewarded. Only then will we produce good results and truly understand the essence of the law of effect.</p>
<h3>The Effectiveness of Morning Exercises (4)</h3>
<p>— Cho Yue</p>
<p>(Seven)</p>
<p>Has the effectiveness of maintaining health and increasing lifespan</p>
<p>In the old society of the past, the general elderly people believed that sports belonged to play and were the business of young people. Even it was better if young people didn't do it. If grown-ups did it, it was inelegant. Where do we see that? Everyone can often see that when the elderly see adults, whether they are jumping, running, or playing with children, they will surely say with contempt, "Are you still young? You're too immature!" From this, we can know that they underestimate or do not understand sports too much, and they do not know that sports training has a lot to do with them, the elderly. "Morning exercises" is one of the most important of these. I believe everyone has the desire to "prolong life." Qin Shi Huang sought immortals, enduring countless hardships and spending countless money and manpower, until his death. This is his foolish behavior and must be a warning to us. I honestly tell everyone that there is no way to seek longevity, but there is a way to not grow old. What ordinary people call "white hair and youthful face" is what I call "not growing old." It is about everyone's "health" and "spirit." For example, although you are sixty or seventy years old this year, your health and spirit are like those of a thirty or forty year old, or even better than those of a thirty or forty year old. This is what I mean by "not growing old." I dare say that there is a guaranteed formula for seeking this kind of not growing old. Is this formula a secret? No, it is public. Now I am about to make it public to everyone. Just be patient, persistent, and constantly practice it. What exactly is this formula? I have already said it before, it is "morning exercises." Everyone who practices morning exercises can maintain health and increase lifespan. Therefore, if we want to achieve the desire of "prolonging life," we must be able to earnestly practice "morning exercises" every morning. (Eight) Has the effectiveness of increasing production</p>
<p>The amount of production does not necessarily depend on too much working time, but on the spirit of working at the right time, as has been proven by predecessors. As for where the spirit comes from, it naturally comes from a strong body, and it is also necessary to have adequate rest and cultivation. The so-called cultivation is to reduce fatigue on the one hand and to increase excitement on the other. From this point of view, the fundamental ability of production is a sound body and an enthusiastic spirit. Only with a sound body and so on can there be abundant productive capacity, and only when the productive capacity is strong will production increase. Since "morning exercises" have the effectiveness of maintaining health, people can recover from fatigue, etc., and indirectly, of course, they can also have the effectiveness of increasing production.</p>
<p>Compatriots, everyone thinks that in this time of national crisis, we should nurture healthy children to contribute to the national revival. Don't think of my words as empty talk, and every adult should practically take the burden of children's physical training on their shoulders again, and even more so, encourage others to reverse weakness. This is the great fortune of the family. (The End)</p>

<h3>Talking About Umbrellas</h3>
<p>— Li Dan</p>
<p>After several days of continuous rain, groups of umbrellas floated on the streets, and leisurely footsteps moved under the umbrellas.</p>
<p>Umbrellas are a relatively popular item here. It is said that this trend came from the rainy and foggy British capital. Because people in London like to carry umbrellas, people all over Britain like to carry umbrellas, so the British here also like to carry umbrellas, so the Chinese here also like to carry umbrellas. This reason is probably quite sufficient.</p>
<p>The British like umbrellas very much, just as they like to raise dogs. It is true of both the government and the public, from the emperor to the common people. Among them, Chamberlain's fondness for umbrellas is the most famous. From the photos in magazines to the cartoons in newspapers, we can see that Chamberlain is inseparable from umbrellas. Although we cannot say that wherever there is an umbrella, there is Chamberlain, it is a fact that wherever there is Chamberlain, there must be an umbrella. Therefore, when we see an umbrella, we think of Chamberlain, and when we think of Chamberlain, we will not forget the umbrella.</p>
<p>An umbrella is a tool for rain protection. On a rainy day, a person can hide under an umbrella. Although it is cramped and dim, it is at least a temporary stroke of luck. In Europe today, which is full of storms, Chamberlain's hand is never far from his umbrella, and he has his reasons.</p>
<p>When Germany and Italy formed the Fascist Axis, and Hitler's executioner, General Goering, delivered a "bombing speech," roughly saying that if the great powers tried to prevent Germany's intentions, Germany would not hesitate to immediately mobilize and fight to the death. As soon as this speech came out, the whole of Europe was enveloped in an atmosphere of storm.</p>
<p>Just like the residents of Hong Kong in these rainy days, they carried their umbrellas and ran back and forth.</p>
<p>However, in that cramped and dim life under the umbrella, although he himself was not drenched, he watched others become drowned rats. He watched Austria merge into the territory of Germany, and he watched Czechoslovakia become a sacrifice for peace. Under that narrow umbrella, there is no room to shield others besides sheltering oneself. However, the storms seem to be getting fiercer and fiercer. Whether a weak umbrella can bear this important task is already a question, even if it is only used to shield one person.</p>
<p>This is not the time to be stubborn. The continuous wind and rain not only shook Europe, but also long ago, crazily, ravaged our country. Many soldiers have already abandoned their umbrellas, steel helmets have replaced umbrella covers, and bayonets have replaced umbrella handles. They brave the storms of the brutish enemy, stand up and advance bravely, until the clear and warm sky renews our land——the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth.</p>
<h3>About Alexei Tolstoy By Konstantin Paustovsky</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chiu</p>
<p>Besides being one of the greatest writers of the new century, A. Tolstoy is the inheritor of the glorious tradition left by Pushkin, Gogol, Chekhov, and Gorky.</p>
<p>The first impression when reading his works - the touch of a keen and powerful talent - is indelible. It will immediately firmly grasp people's imagination.</p>
<p>A. Tolstoy has keen eyes, sharp ears, a lively and extraordinary language, and a rare understanding of the people.</p>
<p>Tolstoy reveals a vast world, a world full of color, freshness, and ideals, a world belonging to people of many eras, from Peter the Great to the socialist era. He opens our eyes to an extremely rich array of characters - often vivid, often touching our heartstrings, often inspiring our emotions, evoking laughter and joy, sorrow and indignation.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's writing career is complete and multifaceted, with entirely unique characteristics. This career is a living and keen heart, coupled with that successful, fearless, and determined effort to find the best way of expression; sometimes there are unavoidable mistakes, the mistakes of a great talent, which slightly diminish the glory of victory. This is a glorious and arduous literary undertaking for the people.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's writing range is so broad, he uses his pen so richly, as if nothing has been left out. Few writers can touch on such broad topics and be so perfect. His works include history ("Peter the Great", "The Days of Peter", "The Book of Love"), imagination ("Aelita", "The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin"), civil war ("The Road to Calvary", "The Coward", "Nikita's Childhood"), children's stories ("Buratino"), powerful and stern stories about the resistance of the Tsarists ("Grain"), the painful fate of self-sacrificing Russian women ("Masyaa", "Under the Old Linden Tree"), Western stories ("Ancient Road", "Black Gold"), and countless other interesting stories, permeated with the atmosphere of wheat fields, gardens, and deep rivers.</p>
<p>Scholars, within a certain range, often become poets. They have keen emotions, which are based on their idealistic courage, their thinking, and their discoveries. Scientific laws are often deduced by the strong and creative imagination of mutually separate and unconnected things. This imagination succeeds in both scientists and writers. Moreover - looking deeply, there is a great common ground between the two. For example, Kepler, who discovered the great laws of celestial mechanics, and Goethe, who created "Faust," have the same creative imagination.</p>
<p>True scientists and writers are blood brothers. They show the beauty of life in science and art, and they both have good knowledge of both.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's language is very clear and close to the people, full of simple strength and deep meaning. Today, there is probably no other writer who has such an organic feeling for the Russian language as Tolstoy. He uses his language as naturally and easily as the people use their fingers and voices.</p>
<p>Tolstoy learned language from the purest and richest source - from the ordinary people.</p>
<p>Therefore, he loves folk art and folk traditions. Therefore, he recently engaged in the work of collecting Soviet folk tales, which has real scientific value.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Huai De</h3>
<p>— By Du Wenyi</p>
<p>——A Record of a Night Attack on the Imperial Army——</p>
<p>Night had fallen. The stars in the darkness kept watch. In this dense lychee orchard, the darkness and silence seemed even more profound. It was time for us to move out. The brothers were rolling up their bedding and putting it into a deeply dug hole. Everyone re-formed into a small circle. A solemn, deathly atmosphere enveloped the surroundings, shining on the dark faces of each brother. In these ten-odd days of night fighting, we had become accustomed to identifying everything without lights, especially since this was our hometown. Although everyone's body was very thin, after this day's rest, we had recovered. Especially since today's attack was because our ammunition and food were almost exhausted, everyone looked a little excited and cheerful.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Chen was the leader of this guerrilla detachment. He was the commander of the Self-Defense Corps and had previously served as a battalion commander. He had suppressed the Communists on the Jiangxi border and had experienced many large and small civil wars. He was quite experienced in combat. Although he was nearly fifty years old, his physique was still as strong as a young man. He had always been a righteous and courageous person. Therefore, after the enemy entered Dongguan City, he led a company of brothers to fight the enemy until only thirty-two men remained in their ranks, then reluctantly retreated to the countryside to replenish their forces. However, the people had all fled. Everything was searched and plundered by the enemy. But Battalion Commander Chen's will was so firm that he inspired this detachment with his spirit. He was unwilling to leave his homeland, so he led this detachment to be active in the villages near the Wan Tai Highway.</p>
<p>He stood up solemnly and said: "Brothers! Are you feeling refreshed?" The comrades said excitedly: "Yes, Commander Chen."</p>
<p>He continued: "I believe you all understand the mission of our attack tonight. Our ammunition is running out! Our food is running out! Our supply depends entirely on whether we can defeat the enemy! Whether we can seize the enemy's bullets and food... Today I received a report that the enemy now has only a small team stationed in Huai De Township, and there is a lot of food and bullets. We already have the head of that township as an inside agent. When we see the oil lamp on the township office flicker, you will launch an attack in three directions. The × army is stationed in the Huang Family Ancestral Hall. We will divide into several small groups and sneak into nearby civilian houses via small paths, first killing his sentries——"</p>
<p>Our detachment began to move in the dark lychee orchard. There was not a single human sound, only the rustling sound of leaves brushing against guns and bodies. We ran out of the lychee orchard, passed a few rugged mountain slopes. We dropped onto the Wan Tai Highway. We walked along the roadside with our bodies crouched. The stars in the night sky, like ghostly spirits, kept shining in our eyes, as if welcoming our column of darkness.</p>
<p>After half an hour, we arrived at Huai De. In the darkness, we could vaguely see the shadows of countless dark old houses surrounded by a belt of orchards. We split into three small teams and crawled into the village on our knees along every small path beside the orchards. We quietly climbed up some lychee trees and hid in the attics of some deserted houses.</p>
<p>The village was deathly silent. After the × army was stationed here, the corpses of those who had been raped and murdered floated in the shining ponds, decaying and stinking on the roadsides and in the houses. The smell of rotting flesh made us feel a little nauseous. Rats moved around the village, chewing on the bones and scraps of dead dogs on the stone slabs of the streets. Some corpses, unwilling to be humiliated, hung from ancient wells and lychee trees. The village was completely filled with the marks of death, a gloomy and desolate scene, as if it were a bombed cemetery and a battlefield after a robbery.</p>
<p>The night was getting deeper. The Huang Family Ancestral Hall was completely plunged into darkness and silence. Suddenly, there was a light on the township office opposite; it kept flickering intermittently. It was time to attack. We prepared our guns and untied the grenades. We aimed at the Huang Family Ancestral Hall. Another corner of the village was burning. A clear whistle broke through the deathly silence of the village. This was our attack signal.</p>
<p>The imperial army peered out from the gate of the Huang Family Ancestral Hall, and our guns fired at them. One after another, they fell to the ground. We surrounded them on all sides. They hid in the house and stubbornly resisted. Machine guns fired from the windows. We threw the hand grenades. "Boom boom boom——" After a burst of explosions, white smoke billowed into the night sky. Dust and shredded meat flew around. Fire was burning here and there.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Chen's assembly whistle sounded. Our team gathered again. He counted the number of people and found that only one comrade had a slight injury to his hand. He ordered us to disperse.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, we moved ten boxes of bullets, seven bags of rice, and five boxes of canned food, countless banknotes, military coupons, and clothes taken from the enemy soldiers. Shoes, and several small steel cannons, rifles, machine guns, horses, etc. Everyone was very excited, because this victory had provided us with so many treasures!</p>
<p>The villagers had all run away, and even the township head who was our inside agent had disappeared. Some of us put the spoils on the horses and returned to our earthen cave in the lychee orchard.</p>
<p>We set the village on fire. Before dawn, our team left the village. On the small slope on the way back, we looked back at Huai De Township and saw only a bright red tongue of fire flashing and jumping in the darkness. Its brilliance not only illuminated the darkness of the night sky and the dawn, but also illuminated the future of the Chinese nation's liberation. The light of this spark will be like the golden morning sun; illuminating every corner of China, and driving away the darkness of the whole world!</p>
<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— By Shu Qun</p>
<p>After accepting this gratitude, he did everything possible to comfort her. So, he covered her collar, covering her cheeks, and he sent her scattered strands of hair inside her collar, and then he prepared to guide her on a journey to an unknown destination.</p>
<p>Before leaving, he shone the flashlight on the maid at his feet—as peaceful as if she were asleep; only her breathing was uneven, and only her hands kept moving in the space, as if searching for her soul that had been scattered by the shock. He gently touched her twice with his foot, to bid her farewell, and to wish her well after the separation; because he left her with a lot of material for conversation.</p>
<p>He and she walked out of the house door and the room door calmly, and quickly walked to the end of the small path in the courtyard. This small path was not as long as when he came, as if there was only the distance of one step when he left. When he and she passed the courtyard gate, the gatekeeper became suspicious and asked her:</p>
<p>"Miss, it's dark, are you still going out?"</p>
<p>He didn't let her answer, he immediately said:</p>
<p>"Not going out, just walking to the gate?"</p>
<p>After hearing this, the gatekeeper recognized that the person who answered was the noble and arrogant guest who had just arrived, so he did not dare to ask any more questions. He did his best to ease the guest's inexplicable anger, and he smiled:</p>
<p>"I mean, why walk if you're going out!"</p>
<p>"Why crawl if you're not walking?"</p>
<p>"Sir, I mean, the mansion has a car; doesn't the young lady always ride in a car?"</p>
<p>"Why have legs if you're riding in a car?"</p>
<p>The gatekeeper always yielded to rude guests, he had no choice but to be rude. His rudeness was only for guests who yielded. Because he remembered that rude guests were often independent of the master and had other dependencies; conversely, they often had other intentions and were waiting for the master's attention.</p>
<p>"Sir, please go!"</p>
<p>Afterwards, he bowed, indicating that he was willing to be polite to the rude person; so as not to be rudely scolded by the master. (19)</p>
