<h3 id="c1">日本軍閥的驚懼 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自從日本侵略者要求世界各國承認它强蠻造成的所謂「東亞新情勢」而得到英美法蘇各國强硬的反駁以來，不特日本政客及官僚聞之大爲恐慌，卽瘋狂不覊的日本軍閥也爲之悚然。英美法蘇對日的精神制裁及經濟制裁，已因美國之積極倡導漸上了實施的日程，這是我們月來所屢次著文討論過的，最近美國羅斯福總統且向議會提出一種議案，要求建設並武裝新的海軍根據地十二處，包括關島，中途島，威克島，阿拉斯加與弗羅里大各大港，及夏威夷與波多里哥，特別是關島的建設更爲積極，日本軍界聞之甚爲驚慌，海軍省最近頒發一本小冊子，讀其內容可知其狼狽周章之狀。但考察各方面的情形，不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>日本海軍省小册子首稱日本現有一極大的危機，卽日本須應付英美法蘇海軍之聯合勢力；這四個國家以其雄厚的海車力量，作中國抗日之後盾。該小册子並謂「日本如欲在遠東建設新秩序，現在無論在海在陸，均有困難」（據東京二十日電）。這是日本侵略者的老實話。日本是個島國，明治中年以後卽以海軍稱雄於世界，它幾次對外的變略戰爭固然得力於陸軍最大，但是海軍的作用也佔重要的地位，例如屢次海軍陸戰隊的作戰，此後在它的國際胃險逐漸擴大成爲第二次世界大戰的階段上，其海軍的重要性將更增大。日本軍閥原預定以陸軍對付中蘇而以海軍對付英美法各國。在過去十幾年間，日本積極擴充它的海軍至海軍條約」的最高限度，而英美法的軍備比例上稍爲鬆懈，遂致日本自認爲海陸軍足以橫行世界。但是最近幾年，英美法因鑒於太平洋及歐洲風雲之日益緊張，故於海軍之設備上急起直追；特別是在太平洋上建設堅固的海軍根據地，如蘇聯之於海參威，英國之於新加披，法國之於安南，美國之於菲律濱等等。英美法蘇的海軍力量，在全部設備完成的時候，不但對於日本是種壓倒的勢力，並且對它形成包圍的形勢。這正如日本海軍省小冊子所言，美國的海軍計劃，實足令美國成爲世界上最可驚的海軍國家，英國的海軍計劃，將令英國於一九四二年前造成海軍實力二百萬噸，蘇聯的潛水艇隊爲世界上最大的。</p>
<p>英美法蘇四個民冶國家雄大海軍勢力之建造，目的完全在於防禦蓄意擾亂世界和平的侵略國家，特別是尖對着幾年來在太平洋上橫衝直撞的日本帝國主義，所以英美法蘇最近的海軍建設不期而同集中於太平洋上。最近有兩種事實更是日本所驚心落魄的原因。第一是蘇聯的海軍設備。日本在「九一八事變」後，集全精神於日本列島與中國大陸的聯絡工作上，所以投下鉅大的費用改革西部日本的各港口，開拓朝鮮北部的新港，縮短大陸重要都市經海到日本的路程。自羅津，淸津及雄基的築港成功後，日本的這一苦心算獲得了相當的成績。但是這個成績將來會因蘇聯海參威雄厚的「潛水艇隊」（據上引小冊蘇聯指定六十艘爲遠東之用）的活動而完全消滅無餘。蘇聯並不滿足於世界上最大的潛水艇隊」，她且將「建造三萬五千噸的戰艦兩艘，八千噸巡洋艦七艘」。（上引小册）。日本想奪取海參威，是樁絕大的難事。</p>
<p>第二，美國進行太平洋方面新海軍根據地的建設，更對日本加以極大的威脅。日本深知太平洋在未來世界大戰所佔地位的重要，所以當歐戰後他卽堅持南洋委任統治地之攫奪。日本南洋委任統治地的幾個羣島，本來在經濟上並沒有什麽價値，而日本力爭至得之而後已，其意義即在於軍事上，因爲這些羣島處於太平洋中，向北可以以小笠原羣島爲橋樑與日本本國聯絡，向西可以與其殖民地的台灣聯絡，其海軍的威力始能發揮於太平洋上。但是美國此後急速的海軍根據地建築，不但對日本的全部海軍根據地採包圍的形勢，並且準備建設關島直撞日本這個海軍根據地的心臟。關島處於日本南洋委任統治地的中間，距日本東部及菲律濱皆約一千五百英里。倘若美國在菲律濱及關島等地的海軍建設成功，至足以破壞日本國與南洋委任統治地的聯絡，則日本的海軍力量不但將大低降，並且有被封鎖於日本三島的附近的可能，而日本陸上幾個大都市遭遇各國飛機的轟炸，終歸於潰滅。</p>
<p>正如英國海軍專家所言：「將來戰爭勝負决於海軍之强弱」（倫敦每日電訊），日本軍閥必定敗亡的推斷，又得到了一個新的論據。</p>
<h3 id="c2">晉冀察邊區粉碎×人圍攻的經驗　某將軍一席談 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（一）充分的準備輿沉着堅决的應付</p>
<p>第一，邊區有反對×人圉攻的充分凖備，他們知道邊區是在×人包圍勢力之下產生，長成笨固起來的，在沒有把日×騙逐出中國以前，×人將不會一刻忘記對邊區的進攻，尤其是邊區愈益擴大與鞏固，軍事上不斷取得勝利，給×人的危害威脅，愈益增大的時候，×人更不會放棄「掃蕩」邊區的企圖。因此他們認爲在邊區的鞏固發展和不斷的取得勝利過程中，縱然政權日臻鞏固，一切建設走上了軌道，社會秩，地方治安，日潮恢復，仍然不能認爲是可以『長治久安』了的『安樂窩』。所以他們時時刻刻提起了自己的警惕性，準備着隨時應付×人的進攻，和積極進攻×人。他們會經不雜的提出『反對太平觀念』，『一切適合於戰爭環境』等口號以提高大衆的警覺性，不爲一時的太平所麻醉。同時邊區的一切工作與日常生活，時時刻刻都是在緊張，迅速，刻苦，深入，實際，有計劃，雷厲風行的一切適合戰爭環境的口號之下進行着。凖備　隨時應付×人新的進攻，所以從整個說來，當×人此次大規模進攻邊區的時候，邊區人民，政權，軍隊，以及一切社會團體，都能沉着的堅决的採取一切的步驟，反對×人的回攻，既不驚慌失措，動搖，逃跑，也不悲觀失望。</p>
<p>（二）正確的領導與堅固的團結</p>
<p>第二，是正確的領導與堅固的團結。當晉冀察邊區創立之始，及其于一年來的鬥爭中，都是在止確的抗×民族統一戰綫總的方針下進行工作，團結的不願做亡國奴的每一個邊區民衆，他們深體「當此民挨危機，更加緊迫之時，我全民埃抗日力量之更加團結，實爲挽救時局的中心關鍵」這一眞理，一年來的過程中，邊區所有人民，政權軍隊及各個黨派那是和衷共濟，在鞏固和擴大抗×根據地的中心任務下，共同奮鬥，他們之間，一般的可謂沒有什麼「磨擦」，更無「親者痛」「仇者快」的事件發生。雖然×人對邊區從來未有放棄過「以華制華的陰謀；裂造謠言，挑發離開，組織僞組織，捏造事實，陷害邊區政權與軍隊，驅逐漢奸匪徒　　邊區，進行各種陰謀，企圖分裂邊區人民政權軍隊之幽結，但這個企圖，在邊區人民，政權，軍隊堅固團給之下，鄧遭到失敗了。同時一年來晉冀察邊區，確　作了不少的偉大事業，在「抗×高于一切」的原則下，政治機構有了比較妥善的改革，民主政治，民生改善，國難教育，也都一般的實現了因而更提高了廣大民衆，軍隊抗戰的决心，與堅持持久戰，爭取最後勝利的信心。同時也愈益增加了人民對政權的擁護與愛戴，和相互間的團結，特別是表現在戰爭緊迫的時候，在遭些大規模的圍攻中，×人雖有充分的凖備，政治的動員，千方百計的企圖分裂邊區的團結，和進入邊區後，四出找尋羣衆「宣　」甚至用錢收買，企圖粗織「維持會」，但始終朱能成立起來。邊區內部漢奸活動，更是極其微弱。</p>
<p>（三）以合整夾擊粉碎×人的『分進合擊』</p>
<p>第三，是我們部隊的動的戰術，邊區部隊對×人團攻的作戰，是採用了游擊戰與運動戰的。邊區的地形條件及民衆條件，對於邊區軍隊的作戰都是非常　裕的。當×人開始大現模的由各方面向邊區中心進擊時，邊區的皋幹部隊，會機巧的分別突擊向邊區進攻之×。由盂縣可五合進攻之×四千餘人，曾被我有力一部迎擊于柏蘭權下耿家莊等地區，血戰四晝夜，×傷亡淸水聯隊長以下約二千人，廣　向　邱前進之×，被我另一部阻擊於直谷口馮家灣一帶，激戰六晝夜，斃×八百餘人，由易縣向　源前進之×五百餘，被我襲擊于王安　地區，而全部消減之，當×人進入邊區後，雖然佔領了某些城鎭與交通要道，但×人「分進合擊』一果而殲滅我有生力量的企閱，却完全沒有成功，卽最後由五台阜平台懷分向耿鎮石咀的「掃蕩戰」除了沿途遭受我不斷打擊殺傷，沿途拋棄屍首，活　傷兵，狼狽逃脫外，亦一無所獲。所以×之的計劃雖然週密，手段雖然毒辣，但是在我兵區部隊靈巧的機動全體民衆反對×進攻的情况之下，就是×人深入邊區佔領某些城鉗與要道，仍然不能限制我們的機動力，相反的，邊區部隊仍能行動自如的繼續不斷的在各個地區，打擊深入的×人，並不斷獲得勝利，同時在×人的後方聯絡上，在其縱深中也不斷的有我有力兵團與游擊隊出現，馬路被破壞了，往退部隊因不斷遭我襲擊，而不敢匪動，守衛　點的×人，也因爲不斷被我襲擾和圍攻，而不敢　　　點外出，×重正亞聯隊長，就是在桑　滬南津，已經×人「掃蕩」了的區城裏，因爲突遭我辦擊隊的襲擊而打死的。同時正太路，平漢路，平綏路和同蒲路也不斷被我破壞，結果是×我的情勢變轉了，給圍攻邊區的×人，給分進合擊的×人以合擊夾擊，使深入邊區的×人，不得不放棄權續進攻的企圓，這是優良的機動，是抗日戰爭中戰略戰術的特色。</p>
<p>（四）堅决持久的作戰，終於把×人拋上了喪兵折將的命運</p>
<p>第四，是　决打×人，堅决了持久的作戰，晉冀察邊區僅僅只有一年的勝史，邊區武裝多是從零散的人民武裝組織起來的。不論在　備上訓練上或其他各方面，都不無缺點，但是他們却具有高度的政消情續。英勇堅决的作戰决心；有百折不撓的毅力，和取得最後勝利的堅决信心。所以當×人以龍大兵力，毒辣手段，飛機大砲猛烈轟炸，其勢汹汹地向邊區淮攻的時侯，並沒有威嚇住了我們邊區的靑年軍隊。就是當×人進入邊區，佔領了若干城鎭，邊區鬥爭環境一時轉入比較嚴重的狀態的時候，靑年的邊區武裝，仍然是穩如泰山，堅特作戰，兩月來大小百餘次的苦戰，雖然未能阻止×人進人邊區和迄今尙未將進入邊區的×人完全肅淸。但確已使×人受了絕大的消耗捐失，犧牲了旅團長一人，　隊長二人，其他官兵達二萬左右，而終於把×人「掃蕩」邊區的計劃完全粉碎了，把×人拋上了喪兵折將的悲慘的命運。</p>
<p>（五）激底的民衆動員工作，給子了×人極大的威脅</p>
<p>第五，這次晉冀察邊區粉碎×人大舉園攻的成功，得力於深入的民衆動員工作者，實屬不少。邊區民衆由於「平時」有着充分的戰爭準備，所以在這次×人大規模的圍攻特。民衆的動員工作，做得非常　度，特別是空舍淸野的工作，更爲普遍與澈底。糧食埋藏起來了，一切　費×用的工具也都收藏了，所有居住在×前進路上的民業遠離了，　給了×人極大的困難，旣找不到給養，又找不到用具，更找不到民眾，不能探詢我軍情况，又無人引路，僞組織更無有組織起來，使×人陷于孤立。尤其在後方運絡綫被截斷後，更不能持久，雖然在民衆參戰工作上，還欠普遍，並且在某些工作上還有對戰爭連絡不够的弱點，但是一般的邊區民衆都積極　動員起來了，他們積極地勇敢地參加搬運傷兵，運送根食，搬運勝利品，破壞道路：並且有不少民衆特別是自術隊員，他們拿起了各種不同的白刃武器，或鳥槍士砲，自發的，單獨的與×人作戰，或配合游擊隊等，散佈在各個路　，田野裏，村落裏，或山地裏與×人作不規則的戰鬥，給了×人極人的威脅，尤是其給了他們精神上絕大的震蕩。</p>
<p>（六）一般的行政機構，在圍攻中仍能發揮其作用</p>
<p>第六是幷於政權工作的，在這次×人團攻邊區的時候，邊區的行政效力強然有因爲戰爭情况緊迫，或政權連系被×人隔斷，而不無減弱的表現，並且還有少數區村兩及政權，未能發揮　應用作用，甚至有無形解體的，但是一般他說來，都還能適應戰爭環境，特別是縣行政區，都具有堅苦奮鬥，堅持持久奮鬥的精神和决心。縱　在比較嚴重的情况下，還是能執行行政工作，與領導廣大民衆配合作戰，或者直接率領地方武裝，展亞游擊戰爭，這確是政治機構澈底改革的直接結果。與那些貪官汚吏，食生怕死，聞聲而逃的官僚們是有天壞之別的。同時這也證明　要在堅持持久抗戰中。使政權工作，仍然不消失　應有的效力，只有澈底加强改革政治機構才有可能的。</p>
<p>（七）一件値得警惕的事情</p>
<p>第七，是一件　得我們　　的事情，在邊區境內有××　所　，　　經過戰鬥，大部份却先解體了，有的　變投了×人，有的化爲土匪，有的驚情失措的逃戰了。到處搶劍民　　使老伯姓受害不少。這原因是由於這些部隊的紐織成份極　　，官兵　　有必要的團結，沒有必要的紀律（有也是打　主義）沒有任何訓練，沒有起碼的政治工作更沒有必要的抗日殺國敎育，所以要　這樣的部隊，忠實于抗日救國的偉業，是沒有保陣的。更該不上要地們在因苦艱難的環境中，衝破並克服一切困偉，在苦難上進行堅　持久抗戰，堅持爭取獨立自由幸福的新中國。同時這也明示着任何一個部隊，假使沒有　好的組成份子，沒有必要的團結，沒　必要的訓練，沒有必要的自覺的紀律，沒有必要的政治工作，沒有必要的抗日救國敎育，以提高民族意識，克服一切不良現象，不但不能保証其忠實於抗日救國事業，堅持持久戰，不顧一切艱苦困難，不届不撓，再接再勵的爲獨立自出幸福的新中國而奮鬥，就無須經過×人的嚴重猛烈的進攻，也要自己解體或轉變無或多或少的危害于民族解放事業的。</p>
<p>以上各點，均爲××將軍對記者所述在這次×人大舉圍攻晉冀察邊區粉　×人圍攻中實際的槪略的觀察，可是我們已經可以從這裏，很明顯地看出：在這次戰役中，×我雙方的鬥爭方式，都具有許多的內容，這是抗戰以來新的經驗與敎訓，也是抗戰愈益持久過程中必然的產物。我們要估計到，在抗戰　續堅持的發展中將必然地產生更多的新的鬥爭方式，因此研究這些經驗敎訓，對於堅持持久戰，特別是對於在×人後方堅持持久作戰，準備不斷的反對×人圍攻，戰勝×人不斷進攻與圍攻，爭取最後的勝利的民埃戰士，是件極有意義極重要的事情。　【完】</p>

<p>— 本報昆明特約記者李寶泉</p>
<p>在雲南現在有一位置得注意的元老，那就是李印泉（根源）先生了。</p>
<p>李先生在遜淸宣統元年，曾於昆明辦有『講武堂』。那時先生身居講武堂總辦之職，其中所出的眾政人材，是現在都極聞名於全國的，好像已故的朱培德氏，現在第八路軍領導者的朱德氏等。這些都是第一期的學生，後來李先生又在廣東韶州繼續所開辦的講武堂，裏面學生像已故的郭松齡氏，現在新疆什督辦的盛世才氏等，亦皆都出於先生門下。其他在國內目前任軍長師長等要聯的將士很多，眞可謂『門生遍天下』了。八一三抗戰軍興，先生那時正在姑蘇作隱居生涯。當吾軍退出蘇州時，李先生就也只好隨軍退出。輾轉到達漢口以後，他那位連處在新疆的學生盛世才督辦，特地由新疆派着飛機將他接了去。但因新疆地勢太高，那空氣也極稀薄，這對於李先生的體留極不相宜的，因此後來就患着心臟衰弱，而且病勢極險惡，不得已就只離開了新疆。那時雲南省政府主席龍雲氏，得了李先生病重離開新疆的消息，於是就打了個歡迎的電報請李先生再返故鄉。李先生也以在這抗戰時期，雲南對全國的軍等政各方面關係非常重大，這不單是『造福鄕梓』那樣簡單而已。於是應龍主席之請，以病重之軀再乘機飛回雲南。龍主席當時以昆明的愉園招待所安處李先生，李先生因醫生的勸吿，除將家屬安置任昆明以外，他自己就到了寧州所屬的溫泉去養病。在遇有重要的事件須與當局磋商時，他繼駕車返省城昆明住上幾天。</p>
<p>記者因與李先生曾有數面之雅，前兩大已聽說李先生業由溫泉囘昆明來過年，所以就投刺往見。李先生雖在極煩忙之中，却仍立賜接見。那魁格雄偉的體格，雖然因在病後手裏還　着手仗，可是臉上的血色却泛出一種鮮紅的光澤，尤其是看到他那兩隻閃光的眼球，可以想出當年輕時是有着勝人底精力的。</p>
<p>李先生與記者塞暄以後，記者就拿目己這次爲申報來訪問的意思說了出來　而且表示像李先生這樣德高望重的長者，要是將他的生活狀况及思想態度記述出來，那是一定爲國內外申報讀者所欣喜的。但李先生的態度　非常謙恭，連連說着：『不敢，不敢』，雙手又抱着不斷的打揖。</p>
<p>經記者幾次的請求，於是在一種極嚴肅而又誠懇的神色之中發表了一些談話：『我離開雲南，已有十四五年了。還是在民國十三年到蘇州以後，就沒有再到雲南來在。去年因爲養病，纔再到本省來居住。我的故鄉是在雲南騰衝的曲石地方，還是明末時代，我的家就由江蘇遷移過去的。我從小就生長在那裏，所以對那裏也不斷在留着深刻的印象。在蘇州住了很久，但故鄉的戀念，是再也不能忘懷的，在我的著作中，還常愛以曲石二字來作題名，好像『曲石叢書』，『曲石文錄』，『曲石詩錄』等，這不過爲了對先祖及故鄉的一些紀念與戀念，其實都是要不得的，以後還得要請措敎。……』</p>
<p>李先生總是那樣的客氣，他的詩做得佳極，我最愛他在曲石詩錄裏那首『哭伯兄太炎先生』的七絕前兩句：『平生風義兼師友，萬古雲零一羽毛』。還有他在將離蘇州時所作的『寫愛』一首裏面有云：『……戰塲頹勢已難挽，險象重重貽厥憂。不幸陷諸倭奴手，典籍財貨任縣求。×××之三島去，壯土駢戮文士因。此時景象何得　，炎黃華皆比馬牛。帝國主義原如此，不能自强亦何尤，……』</p>
<p>在這首詩裏，不但可以看出李先生底用字上像『帝國主義』等名詞是極自由而又極大胆地在施用着，就是在詩格上，也擺脫着向來那種陳腦的舊戚而馳聘於寫實丰義底領套中的。我當時因爲同李先生談到他的時作，於是就引起了他的興趣，笑着吿訴我在返滇時有首詩，於是就朗吟着道：『神鷹鼓羽出長安，萬里淡雲一日還；借間客歸何所有？一身疾病二毛斑』。我當時立刻用筆來抄了，現在就加在這訪問記的文字中。李先生關於其它的著作，好像一景　堂詩文集』，「雲南金石　略初稿」等，都是極有價値的，現在因爲篇幅關係，不能在此作詳細的介紹了，以後有機會，我們冉來細遠罷。</p>

<p>西班牙戰爭，是意德兩個法西斯侵略國家危害西班牙民主共和國的戰爭，同時也是這兩個侵略國家危害歐洲民主列强尤其是英法兩國的戰爭。可惜　主國家爲侵略者的『反共』煙幕所迷惑，爲目光短淺的自私自利心理所限制，沒有認淸這一點，他們夢想侵略者在西班牙獲得某種滿足後便不再騷擾到他們身上來，因此早在兩年半前就對這件實際侵害他們本身的戰爭，採取所謂『不干涉』政策，放任意德鐵騎與炸彈在西班牙縱橫亂舞，甚至這次國聯行政院還要討論撒退援助西班牙共和軍的外國志願兵問題！怪不得意大利因此更加瘋狂的策動進攻，現在法西斯軍且已迫近巴賽龍納迫近法國邊境；更怪不得引起英法各國共產黨工黨社會黨和其他進步正義人士的憤激反對，主張立刻大舉援助西班牙政府，而美國前國務卿史汀生亦於昨晨要求撤銷軍火運往西班牙的禁令了！</p>

<p>— 髯虬</p>
<p>自從俾斯麥的東進政策收入希特勒的『我的奮鬥』而復活以來，羅馬尼亞也就變成國社黨的侵略對象之一。卡羅爾是帝德賀亨卓倫族的後裔。他的外婦盧貝斯古夫人是全國最富的女人。雖是猶太血族，而主張排猶最力。在政治上的力量，與英國的奧斯德夫人比較，至少不相上下。卡羅爾的四周全是一批腐敗軍人，貪汚官吏和無聊政客。特別是一個所謂軍官團都是封建地主的子弟所組成，法西氣味非常濃厚。因此希特勒的間諜會混進羅馬尼亞的中央重要機關。許多政黨在他的指揮之下。羅國報紙接受戈培爾指揮者達八十多家。德國宣傳部在一九三六年用於羅國的宣傳費就達六千萬羅幣，幾乎每個城市都有印着卐字標誌的報紙公然發行。希特勒的東進和德皇一樣，首先想（一）英國中立（二）意國同情（三）使法國淪於無能。他居然一帆風順把萊茵區武裝起來，在西佛萊特一線建築工事，隔絕了法國援助東歐同盟國的去路與波蘭訂了所謂十年不侵犯條約，橫斷蘇聯援助法蘭西的孔道，利用意國在意阿戰爭時的孤立，而結成了德意軸心，以援助佛郞　爲意國默許兼併奧大利的交換條件，等到三國防共協定成立以後，於是就把捷克開刀。張伯倫旣保證以後英德不戰似乎希特勒在東南歐可以獨步，不必再顧忌英國干涉了。可是希特勒的前送未必如此樂觀。去年九月哈立法克斯到柏林與他談判的結果，固然以英國默許他兼併奧大利與分割捷克爲德國暫時擱置殖民地要求的交換條件，現在都已逐步實現，但是如果再要進攻，英國就不能再守中立。××××××××决不能再搬到巴爾干島去讓他衝進近東的門戶。</p>
<p>明興會議以後，法國在歐洲已經淪於次要地位，雖然不敢放棄法蘇協定還想繼續掙扎，可是捷克分割以後，大勢已去，不得不追隨英國。就中歐巴爾干與近東而言，英法利害相同。至少在防止納粹勢力侵入其勢力範圍的一點上是完全一致的，所以希特勒雖然無已使法國淪於無能爲力，决不能叫英國永遠中立。而且在爭取意國同情的一點上也沒有把握。意大利願意德國去收回海外的殖民地。因爲莫索里尼知道德國的海軍還不够與英國對壘。一旦到手就非仰仗意國的海軍帮忙不可。這樣就能呌希特勒聽他說話。因此他竭力煽動德國的黨人去加緊向海外發展而不希望德國在歐洲坐起來擋住他向巴爾干與近東發展的出路。意國在巴爾干半島及土耳其等國的市場在國聯通過對意經濟制裁之後，已被德國侵奪殆盡。今年不費一彈又兼併了奧大利和捷克的蘇台區，莫氏看到他的徒弟神通廣大，居然靑出於籃，勢力驚乎其上，於楚侷促不安，要想設法阻止，最近匈牙利要求收囘捷克南部的盧森尼亞而與波蘭接壞，意大利很贊成。目的想由波匈兩國的聯合陳綫構成防止德國東侵的壁壘。希特助也很明白而且他早已胸有成竹，盧森尼亞是烏克蘭民族區域，在波蘭及蘇聯境內都有很多烏克蘭人，他想把它作爲根據地，做侵略蘇波的張本。莫索里尼怕希特勒在西班牙拆台，因此未敢堅持。不過我們應富知道英意協定是德國兼併與大利之舉所激動，而是分割捷克之時所完成。莫索里尼决不會永遠替希特勒作嫁的。</p>
<p>其次我們講到匈牙利，匈牙利在戰後失掉很多土地與小協約國向來對立。對羅馬尼亞因爲失地關係尤無好感，原想借重德國的力量相與對抗，可是自從奧亡以後，就直接與德國爲隣，感覺威脅，希特勒早想使匈牙利供其驅使，所以答應帮助他收回在捷克的失地。可是希持助臨時變卦，收囘盧森尼亞而與波蘭接界的要求竟爲希特勒否决。而且盧森尼亞變成德國的大烏克蘭獨立運動的根據地。匈牙利當然感到失望。將來德國進攻羅馬尼亞的時候，希特勒冉簽空頭支票，是否再會上當，允許其假道伐　。就要看巴爾干各國與匈牙利的關係能否改善和馬格亞民族的警惕性如何而定了。</p>
<p>波蘭是羅馬尼亞的北鄰。原來與德國非常接近。最近看釗捷克的遭遇，覺得已在德國勢力三面包圍之中，而且所謂大烏蘭民族獨立運動根本就以她爲對象。特別是但澤自由城與波蘭走廊，岌岌可危。於是急忙簽訂了波蘇新約，並且與立陶宛言好。外長柏克的傑作，受着國人熱烈的讚許。最近國會改選。全國統一陳綫的領袖麥科斯基敎授當選爲衆院議長，梅靜斯基上校爲參院議長。波蘭已在轉向反德路綫。蘇聯是羅馬尼亞的西鄰，在反法西斯鬥爭之中，她是全世界的主力軍，羅爲尼亞如果有自衛的决心，先把國內納粹走狗肅淸，蘇聯當然樂于援助。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c46">難兵營裏 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>從沙頭角退入英界而被看守　的九百多　孤軍，在馬頭涌難兵營里，度着孤苦的生活，一個月來，僥倖沒有發生怎樣的異動。可是自從一槍斃逃兵」這事發生後，不幸的事件，便接踵而來。社會人士對他們的不幸，都予以莫大的同情；當局對於這件事也密切地注視，幷刻意改善他們的生活，消弭種種不幸發生。昨天，記者獲得一個很好的機會，跑到警衞森嚴的難　營裏，探視這些難兵，恰巧靑年會派來的難兵服務團也在這時至了，增加了不少熱鬧。在這裏，月把所得到的印象，約略記下。</p>
<p>是中午的時分，友陽熱鬨鬨的撫摩在　們的　上，下了公共汽車。跑着那段通過難兵營的黃坭大道，頻忙的走着，額上微微的沁着汁，可是到了難兵營，看見拱衛森嚴的景象，恍惚已失掉了太陽熱力了。在心坎跳動的，祗有「冷酷」！難兵一個個穿着灰色的棉襖，瑟縮地在太陽下蹲着，在他們營養不足而又　黑的臉上，更顯着一種落寞的憔悴。爲了使他們獲得了正確的消遣，所以把第二號房闢作俱樂部，這時很多人都圍在長桌上，看着人家送來的書報雜誌。另外圍在一堆的就是唱留聲機的。　上貼滿了靑年軍人服務團送來的警惕的標諳，和其他的壁報，周遭佈滿了新的氣象！</p>
<p>沒多時靑年會軍人服務團的上幾個同志到了，從睡床爬起的，在散步的，在，書的難兵，不約而同的聞風而集，四邊窗眼都塞滿了人頭，把這幾十個團員包圍來。「報紙！報紙！」一派喧嚷的聲音，跟着大家便聲到手到的來搶。「別動，一會兒由管理人派給你們看」，服務團裏一個年靑的小夥子，這樣的嚷着。大家聽了，都垂手立在一旁。</p>
<p>把外面的親戚朋友給他們的信派過了，便開始時事報吿：『西北的戰事……×人冀圖截斷我們的國際路線，但他這祗是夢想……現在那裏的×人已給重重的包圍着了。」年靑的小夥子不斷的說着，一現在說到廣東這邊的戰事了！」——廣東！廣東！惹起了一陣小小的騷動。「北路方面，十五日夜，有×兵一千餘人，從鐘落潭　鶴的附近，想着向北侵犯，給我們埋伏的炮兵，乘其不備，奮起發炮；我們英勇的將士，也跟着衝過去，大炮和手榴彈齊飛，殺他一個片甲不留。」這時他們耳在聽，心在想，想起他們在戰場時的活躍，想起他們殺×時的痛快，有些是呆住了，有些是拍着大腿叫快。小夥子頓了一頓，繼着說下去：「現在我們十萬大軍，已經分路挺進，向廣州作大規模的包圍，相信不久的將來，我們使可以把這些殘×完全趕出廣東去。」一陣熱烈的掌聲，送了喘着氣小夥子下台！</p>
<p>跟着便是唱他們帶來的留聲機，爲首的一隻唱片，喚做保衞大廣東，是唱廣東話的『同胞三千萬衆，必須保衛大廣東……』雄壯的謌聲，鑽進他們的心腑，他們都非常的興奮。繼着唱的是保衛中華『你們大家還未有認識謌詞吧！等我來跟大家說一說』小夥子一邊站起身一邊說：『頭一句是保衛中華，保衛中華，誓死保衛民主的中華，意思是說，在着個國族存亡危急之秋，除去了漢好以外，誰個不想保衛我們的中華民國，但是我們是不是用口去保衛呢？不！我們要拿出我們所有的力量，置生死於度外的去保衛中華」，末了一句是看東北河山，依舊靑天白日滿地紅飄，聽四萬萬大衆唱，自由平等解放，意思是說，看我們獲得了最後的勝利的時候，靑天白日滿地紅的國旗，依舊飄蕩在東北，那個時候四萬萬中華民族的的兒女，都齋聲合唱，唱甚麽？不是唱「爲佳人』而是唱自由！平等！解放啊！』一陣輕快的笑聲，結束了這只謌詞的解釋。</p>
<p>雄壯的謌聲，播放出來，每個人的內心已在騰沸的躍動了，唱片完了，小夥子跟着跳上甚上高聲的問道：「你們願意保衛中華嗎？」臺下馬上跟着道：『願意！」「那末，你們就要嚴守紀律，不可輕舉妄動，待他日再有機緣，然後車顯身手了！」小夥子舉着手高聲的說着，臺下也齊聲的報好！」</p>
<p>跟着小夥子又搓着手跳上臺來，敎他們唱歌：「動負動員……」不用敎便會唱了。小夥子道：你們還是一實力未老呀」！大家都笑了。第二隻是打×××……也是不用怎麽樣指導，便很流利的唱出來，小夥子輕人的道：「你們都唱得很好呀，祇是唱打字的時候要用力，「×××××××××××」大家聽了都禁不住嘩的一聲笑將起來了。</p>
<p>謌唱完了，便召集了他們每間房裏面的代表來談話，關於各人私自潛逃的事，大家有點甚麽意見，各人聽了，都按着房號的次數，很天眞的發表他自己所知到的意見。一位代表凑近了點說：「我們快要晚飯了。你去看看那邊的情形好了，我們在醫官的口裏，很清楚知到政府發給我們的食用的數量，每餐每人例定靑菜三兩，鹹魚二兩，白米十一兩。肉食一兩，但現在兩餐合隴計算，也難找到這個數量啊！倒是米一項會超過十一兩的，因爲那米夾雜很多穀壳在裏面啊！我們曾和廚子交涉。你猜他們說些甚麽？他們說「假如不能下嚥的話，最好是不吃啊！」</p>
<p>還有，現在是冬夭哪，富人們重裘疊褥，不知寒冷是怎樣的滋味的。我們僥倖的領得兩張　　，不够運氣的祇領到一張，瑟綿在寒風下，那種凄凉的况味，那有人知道味。……。這位代表一口氣的說下去，說得氣也喘臉也紅了。</p>
<p>聽了這些話，大家都受了深深的感動，默默無言，惟有極力的安慰他們暫時忍耐，不要妄動，等候最後勝利的來臨，那時節，便可重出生天了，大家聽完了，都歡呼而散！</p>
<p>最後，我們希望負責人能够嚴密注竟他們的待遇，盡量加以改善，使今後的不幸事件，能够廓而淸啊！</p>

<p>— 白章</p>
<p>返惠紀行之五</p>
<p>一，出發途中</p>
<p>【本報特約旅行通訊】「十，十二」之變，×人傾全力從大亞灣登陸，進攻廣州，使南華淪陷於魔手上。我們觀察通盤的戰局，惠州爲×軍使略的起點，固然於戰局上具有重要性；而博羅一縣，却是惠州和廣州軍事交通的樞紐，當×軍向增城推進時，正利用博羅分兩路迂迴圍襲，就是以後華南的軍運，也完全利用貫通博羅的廣惠公路爲交通的孔道。在一般的軍事上說，是極富於軍事價値的地方。而且，此次×軍的後撤，還盤踞着增城石龍兩個據點，徘徊於博增邊區的荔枝　，及博莞邊區的東博一帶，顯　現在的博羅，正站在東線的最前線上，仍脫不了戰時狀態。爲了憑吊那些摧毀於×人魔手下的刦後餘灰，爲了景仰着挺立在前絲上的我們戰士，在這大舉反攻的前夜，似乎都應往博羅從事廣博的訪問，完成我們記者所負的天職。</p>
<p>東江別動隊正司令官駱鳳翔（左）及副司令官梁柱（右）</p>
<p>由於這個動機，雖明知道初收復的城市。秩序和戰事尙未安定，不無相當的危險和困難，但也不能一一計及。遂决定了兩條出發的路線：首先沿東江而下，着重於東江中下游的地帶；然後再沿惠廣公路前往，着重於博增邊境區，卽我軍的最前綫上。十二月三十日的上午，記者便僱了一隻快艇，順江而下，開始了勇敢的旅行。同時爲了中途土匪的猖獗，幷請了幾位自衛團的團員，作記者的臨時保鏢。</p>
<p>那天的天氣沒有雨，也沒有風，非常的陰鬰。但深灰的濃厚雲層，一片片的結合在天空裏，似乎大地正釀造着雨意。因爲沒有風，艇行得很慢，記者在這緩緩而合着節　的欵乃聲中，乃得盡情的憑吊沿江兩岸的殘迹。記得十月十四日一五一師從惠州撒退時，雖然都指定在博羅集中，可是一部從北門渡江過水北站沿公路而往。一路却沿江直下劍潭渡江而往。所以自惠城達劍潭的一段江岸，至今尙能見到零碎的軍服和用器。足證當時撒退的散亂而無計劃。也足證該師指揮者的無能，致形成這次悲痛的失敗。不過『失敗乃成功之母』，我們總希望從沉痛的敎訓中，建立起新的力量。據艇佚說，前幾天仍有幾具給風雨剝蝕了的屍骸散陳在河干，正給鄰近鄉村的鄕民收去，不知是士兵還是平民。眞的，無時無地不留落×人所賜予的殘酷血賬，我們何時才能洗雪呢？</p>
<p>自惠城至劍潭紙有十餘里的水程，我們到劍潭時已正午。忽然發現×機三架掠頭而過，自南向北，在犬空飛得很低，軋軋的機聲突然破碎了我們旅途中的岑寂。怕是爲了淸楚的偵察，倏時降低，在艇的上空繞了一個圈子才掉頭而去。我們的小蜓在×機盤旋的刹那間，論情勢雖有點像餓鷹下的小鷄，但艇裏的自衞團已提起槍掩蔽在篷　中，準備×機低落掃射時給以迎擊了。不論力量的大小，爭取代價是我們應有的决心。</p>
<p>劍潭本是惠博水道中的一個險要點，兩山夾峙，潭水甚深，不斷的浮出打滾的漩渦滇桂軍東征時代，曾作過戰場。惠城的粵軍守將楊昆如正慘敗于此。細想着那個戰場上的鬼魂，不禁痛怨他們不留在今天民族抗戰中而死，太把生命的價値浪費了。但這次我們守軍，却不加設防，任×軍揚長而渡，未免有點寂寞了。現在迴旋的江面，沒有什麽，祗有十餘隻給×人焚燬的船隻，斷檣殘楫，倒影在碧綠的江波上，刺激行客而已。</p>
<p>經過博羅沒有多大逗留，因爲要趕於黃　前到達蘇村。過博羅城十餘里的譚公爺，也和劍潭一樣的險峻。岸邊的山上有譚公廟，俗傳船行過此，必須焚香默禱，否則不利。「菩薩」也會收「行水」了。這里向爲土匪出沒之區，我們也有戒心，大家握槍虎視，終幸安然，心裏不住羨慕着槍的威力。（未完）</p>

<p>交通旅行</p>
<h3 id="c48">給將去昆明的人們 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 夏羅</p>
<p>朋友：　你有感覺空氣鬰悶麽？你有感覺精神疲乏麽？你會感覺生活程度太高麽？你史會感覺得到讀不着書麽？那麽，你馬上整備你的行　，離開這沉悶的香島，回到我們的國土，樂園，到昆明去、這兒的一切，讓我所知介紹給你罷。</p>
<p>昆明的天氣，是最明朗了！在碧藍的晴空下，整天吶滿了金色的陽光，生活這樣新鮮空氣和溫郁的日光下，總是使人愉快的。在氣候的調換上，一年四季都是同一樣情調的；到處都是靑綠，每天都是和熙。有兩句詩：『四時皆春夏，一雨便成冬』。是最恰當的寫照。而雨季是夏末秋初，其餘的日子是很少下雨的。</p>
<p>昆明的風景：這兒有幽靜的西山，我曾在他們的和尙寺裏，過了一星期的隱士生活，淸晨爬上山頭望日出，夕暮聽占寺鐘聲，眞使人感到了無限的壞戀！還有藍得像寶石似的？明湖，月夜泛舟最詩意不過。其餘許多名山勝跡，使人惚忽置身北平，有小北平之稱。然而在外來的異邦人，却又會讚美聲一：凍方的小瑞士。</p>
<p>生活程度：昆明畢竟是一個內地的小城市，生活程度本來是很低的。可是抗戰以後，從沿海各處都會逃來這兒的人們日見增多，於是這一個小小的山城，頓成空　的景氣，百貨公司，電影院，大旅店，都相繼林立，把　座占舊的昆明城，也摩登化起來，不過生活程度也一天一天的跟着高漲——從前鄱以老旗票爲買賣單位的！現在都起碼要中央幣了。至於生活程度的確數如何！很難有標準的，因各人的經濟情况而定。姑以普通學生爲例：食用每月七八元，至於零用費，娛樂費，買書費等，經濟充裕一些的，自然可多買一點，最彈　的，假如要我非說出一偭總數不可時，我可以籠統的說，除膳費外，十塊錢大洋一月很可以過得去</p>
<p>來時應置備的東西：在昆明，外來的洋貨是相當貴的，不比國貨便宜。來時不要帶多種的洋貨，如被海防海關發覺，就會拿去，我以爲少買爲妙，這點要先注意的。昆明的大氣在冬李和平常的早晚，溫度是相當低的，所以要帶　被來，在夏大有蚊子，蚊帳也不要忘記。這兒的女同學因多是外來的，所以衣着服飾方面却和廣州差不多，冬天是大衣，夏天是短袖的旗袍，高跟鞋，電熨頭髮也不少。總之，在廣州穿什麼就帶什麽來好了。</p>
<p>你們心目中定以爲昆明是很荒蠻古舊吧？可是來到以後，會使你驚異的，因爲　街都是最新式光亮的汽車；觸目都是年靑漂亮的紳士和香氣四溢的摩登仕女；觸身的都是無線電廣播的音樂。在有聲電影院裏，當開映時，會送來一陣陣本地口昔解書聲，像廣州默片時代一樣，這莫是昆明市的特色。救亡工作，循例是有，可惜多　官樣文章，不大爲人注意。實在有點痛心。</p>
<p>這兒，除霎南大學外，搬來的有西南聯大，中央研究院，中正醫學院和國立　專，現在中大也搬來了，昆明快變爲一新的文化中心，更添了不少熱門。至於新增的畫紙刊物更不少，如有名的天津益世報是。從香港經安南到雲南昆明，約五十元港幣便够，假如和團體同來，更可經濟一點，我所吿訴你的，暫此於此。</p>
<p>留港澳的學子，不要寄居這殖民地下。這兒眞正是你的樂園，眞正給你去發展，一方開　着你的書本，一方面幹點救亡工作，來罷，到昆，來罷，有機會再談。　夏羅敬上</p>

<p>南平的地位，適踞福建省的中心，建溪富屯溪沙溪三水在此合流南下稱爲閩江，因此地理上的優勞，南平逐成爲閩北交通的總隘口。自閩西南公路多　展築後，此處沙縣永安，一道可以通西部的延城長汀龍岩，抵達閩粵邊境，一道可以通南部的大田億化永春，直迫沿海地帶；故目前南平又爲閩西南對閩中交通的要點。福建省政府於去年五月間遷治西部永女，團新省會後。全省政治文化重心，隨之西移，南平在今日遂益佔重要地位。記者兩年前，曾在　平生活若干時日，現在重臨，確實覺得它已換過了一番面目，元旦過去後的第二天，綿綿　雨，氣候寒冷，不減江浙。</p>
<p>從南平站西行的慢車，時間是七時半，汽車從南平開出後，一直都是沿着沙溪行駛，左邊有山，右邊看水，沿途的景色確乎不壞，可惜車行　箥，走不上兩個鐘頭，頭腦便漸昏眩便流覽景色的心情，也被打散個精光了。</p>
<p>閩江上游的支流，水流不暢，一路灘石成叢，倒佔據子溪身的大半，　不時發現一雨疔帆　，終覺得這樣的河水，沒有航行的價値。福肆內部，蘊藏　豐饒的物產，一旦開發，地利無窮，不過首先還是要交通運輪有發展。才能談到這一點。目前閩省內地公路的展　，雖有相當可觀的成績　而河道的開通，還　能做一點調查測量的工作。抗戰使我們認識了許多從前所忽略的事情，從這一次抗戰以後，我想一切地方的開　事業，無疑的都將飛速發展，而爲建國富國的重要工程基礎。</p>
<p>離南平後車行三小時到沙縣，有半小時以上的停留。車站與縣城，中隔一條溪水，有波船往返，沙縣目前在福建省是一個重要地方，記者　在另一篇文中，曾經把它比做「北伐前的黃埔，抗戰前的廬山」，因爲目前閩省多種發動抗戰力量的訓練工作，在此舉辦，成萬的　壯男女從這裏接受了戰鬥的新敎育後，散遍福建全省，担負着　民動員的艱鉅任務。下車眺望對岸，不禁對着那一座環抱初生命，孕育地的城牆，引起無限的敬意</p>
<p>站上人衆紛雜，而大半爲公務員軍人，站首站尾，各立一架大幅油畫，畫上有烽火，有怕怒的臉，有堅挺鋒利的鎗刺大刀，十足煊染了此時此地的緊張空氣。</p>
<p>乘客午飯完畢，汽軍繼續西行。此去山嶺重疊，公路大部分係從山沿開鑿而成，路面比較狹窄不平，車行顚簸，較行過的一段爲劇，翻越山嶺時，傾斜盤旋，尤使人提心吊阻，不敢側臉下望，聽車上人說，這一段公路，在前還要壞得多，此刻正在積極改善之中。果然一路遇見不少民工，成羣結隊。在修築道路，鑿山塡土，全忙得滿頭大汗，汽車過時，他們放下鐵錘鋤頭，或停下挑着泥土行走的兩脚，注目而觀，記得某處讀過一段文章，說：我們這次抗戰中前方將士用血肉抵抗敵人的炮火，固然可敬，但後方這些爲維持交通遝輸而辛勤流汗的勞苦同胞，也値得我們感謝，車憲外掠過他　忠厚樸實的臉，我的心中油然生出了敬意。</p>
<p>沿公路看見不少碉堡，是從前爲防匪而築，沙河西來，還看見兩座城墻，想是廢業了的　前縣治所在地。這種城堡專　對內防匪之用，在今日抗日戰爭中，我以爲它們的功用卻已全失，不但功用已失，且恐反足資×，爲害無限，因爲，這種城墻　堡，在防禦作用上旣抵擋不了×人現代化武器的進攻，一旦被×人侵佔時，卻反足以防備我們濟南戰的活動。試看今日廣大濟南區域中，多少個城池，一被×人估據，就很難收復，一可知　堡在今日爲有害無益，亟須拆除。</p>
<p>車過××鎭後　行片刻，驀見一幅鮮明國旗，高揚空際，待駛近時，在我們眼前現出一個平坦的廣塲，「立正」「稍息」的高音口令，從那裏迸發而出，一隊武裝兵士，正在場上練習殺×武藝。廣塲出口，正對公路立着一座石門坊藍底，橫額標着四個斗大白字，『候命前驅』這嚴肅悲壯的景象，刺激了車內所有乘客，全體緘起談人說地的　巴，尙廣塲中的武裝同胞和　揚空際的國旗，作了一次默敬。</p>
<p>這可說是延沙永道七的新氣象，記者兩年前經過這條路時，紙是一派　落，情景凄凉，現在不但村莊漸見整潔，而一路荒無的田疇，也長遍了綠色的麥苗，可見閩省提倡冬耕增加生產，已經收到了效果，而經過相當敎養後的民衆，也顯得有了新生的轉機了。</p>
<p>延沙水道上，行旅雖苦，而這次由東到西劃過閩省腹部的旅程中所見事物，却使記者感到很大的欣慰。</p>
<p>車行至下午三時半，抵永安站，可以一瞻福建新省會的這個小小山城——永安的新氣象了！</p>

<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>（一）身體直立，兩脚左右分開約一尺，兩臂向頭頂伸直，兩手互轉，兩脚站穩，上身向前，右·後左握　成後圓圈，　週愈大愈好，轉完十或十二圈後，繼紗向前，左一右同樣轉動，至於呼吸的方法，最好是在身體　移動時呼氣，轉完一圈後稍停片刻，同時吸氣。</p>
<p>這個運動以鍛鍊腰腹臀三部爲主。</p>
<p>（二）這個運動與前相似，但改以兩手揷腰，一脚置於高約十八寸的椅子上，以上身的重量集中於另一腿之上。先以左脚置於椅上，上身向左右兩方向各轉動五次；做完後，改以右脚置於椅上，上身同樣轉動。</p>
<p>（三）身體直立、兩臂下垂於身旁、先以右腳　量向左踢起、愈高愈好、兩臂同時擺向右方、保持身體的平衡、左右兩腿交替而行、動作要和諧、膝部不可彎屈、兩腿各做十至十二次、左或右腿踢起時吸氣、放下時呼氣、</p>
<p>這個運動也可以仰臥在地上舉行、對於臂部和大腿都很有益。</p>
<p>（四）身體直伸，仰臥地上；彎身坐起，上身儘量向前彎下，至手指與足尖相觸爲止。共做十全十五次。彎身坐起時呼，上身向後臥下時吸。</p>
<p>這個運動不僅是一個很好的腹部運動，並能伸展背腰各部的肌肉，增進身體的柔軟性。</p>
<p>（五）在地上爬行實爲一種很好的運動，它的功用余了伸展全身各部肌肉，使身體平均發達之外，尙能强　　背兩部，使內部器官的作用活躍和正常，在爬行的時候，兩腿不可過於　屈，兩臂也要直伸。先向前爬行，再向後退。呼吸要深長和平均。</p>
<p>（六）身體到豎於地上，兩腿直伸，與地面垂直，兩手支撑於腰部，保持身體的平衡。然後兩腿交替儘量向頭後伸；上身不可移動。一腿向後伸時，另一腿仍須保持與地面垂直的姿勢。呼吸要平均：兩腿各做十或十五次。</p>
<p>這個運動需要腹部肌肉的控制，對於大腿，臀，腰各部都很有益。</p>
<p>這次所介紹的六個運動，最大的功效是保持身體的平衡。身體　確的姿勢是「健」和「美」的先决條件，如身體不能平衡，必不能角正確的姿勢，身體的重心是在臀部，但與臀部關係最密切的有，腿，腹，腰各部。這次我們的運動也側重於這幾部的鍛鍊。　（完）</p>

<p>娛樂……郡主與侍者</p>
<p>Baroness　and　the　butler</p>
<p>本是出名的舞台　劇、現在改編電影、故事本身有着濃厚的喜劇趣味、更加上幽默明星威廉飽惠爾、和安娜蓓拉賣力的演作、使本片成爲一部極優秀極成功的作品、</p>
<p>威廉鮑惠兩飾一侍者、是某伯爵家中最能幹的僕人、對於家務各項、都處理得井井有條、伯爵全家對他皆極滿意、但事情出人意表的、這侍者竟暗中從事政治活動、而被選作議會議員、幷且是站在與主子敵對的黨派方面、在職業上他是一個矢忠主　的僕人、而在政治方面、却大發政論、無微不至的攻擊他的主子、那伯爵還算心胸寬闊、對他還有相的的諒解、最不服氣的還是伯爵的女公主、一個標準的貴族小姐（安娜蓓拉飾）、而在這糾紛矛盾的情形之下、閙出了連篇的笑話、</p>
<p>片中有極美妙的對白、幽默詼諧中含有眞理、威廉飽惠爾的作風沒有改變、沉着鎭定之中、自有令人絕倒之處、安娜蓓拉在這部片中、還算是第一次在美國製的影片中出現、她也有極優秀的演出、</p>
<p>皇后……軍校兩球王</p>
<p>Touchdown　Army</p>
<p>本片大部份是以美國West　Pofnt軍校爲背景、表現着嚴明的紀律、齊整的會操、又穿插着一段三角的戀愛喜劇、更殿以一場緊張熱鬧的足球賽、這種故事的取村、已是數見不鮮、但全劇的演出、尙有相當之成就，</p>
<p>內容描寫一個虛浮的公子哥兒、爲了一個女于、甘心入軍校、受盡種種的磨鍊、不意這女子的苦心、却已別有所屬、後因他球藝的高超、大出風頭、才博得那女子的靑睞、</p>
<p>片中球賽與及會操等場面、大部份由時事片剪接而成、但因技術的巧妙、遂不稍露痕跡、約翰霍活在片中飾一小敎官、沒有他演偵探片那樣精彩、</p>
<p>平安……最後勝利</p>
<p>Wbite　Bannners</p>
<p>由文豪萊特德格拉斯近著「自幟」改編的、故事本身趣味很濃厚、本劇編製妥善、演員支配也稱得體、全片演出極爲動入、固爲太倫理氣味、也許爲一般人所感不到興趣、但耐心看下去、却有今人感覺到可取了、</p>
<p>克勞特倫斯、歷來演出、都很有成績、這次他飾一位愛好工作的敎師、演出可謂入化了、加之幾位配由如費斐德、賈克古栢、及素演反派角色的童星　尼泰格倫維改變作風而師一熱情的少女、都很優秀令人滿意、</p>
<p>東方……巧女歌聲</p>
<p>Mad　About　Mousic</p>
<p>一支非常動人的悲喜劇、故事有些地方比較欠强、可是因爲喜劇關係、也不成問題、導演把全片處理得很緊凑、每處進展都能抓住着喜劇的風趣、</p>
<p>狄娜竇萍演出極爲美妙、幾支歌曲亦很動聽、配角也是很完美的</p>
<p>大華……頑童小傳</p>
<p>The　Adventure　of　Tomsawyer</p>
<p>是一部很優容的文藝影片、就是根據馬克吐溫的厚　改編的、全片雖然很長、但導演處理得宜、那種輕快生動的調子、使我們並不覺得沉悶、一部份也因爲一輩童角出色的表演、尤其是兩個主角、飾姑母的梅雜遜演出亦很好、</p>
<p>景星……漫浪夫人</p>
<p>Divorce　of　Ladyx</p>
<p>一張滑稽愛情片、故事當然是缺少可能性的、全片寫在倫敦大霧之夜、一大批在酒店尋歡樂的人、迫得不能回去、而要向酒店裏找尋房間、結果有一位夫（曼兒奧白朗）、　去闖進了一位單身男客的房間裏、故事就這樣展　、</p>
<p>趣味相當濃厚、但終晚不了英國作風、全片染着彩色、增加了不少美觀</p>
<p>新世界……正一多情種</p>
<p>許曼麗鄺山笑主演</p>
<p>中央……珍珠衫</p>
<p>好萊塢的陳査禮逝世才不久，中國電影界便有陳査禮的產生、這種投機的乎段、旣無須耗費宣傳之勞、而能坐收號召之效、中國製片家的聰明、於此可見一班、但本片內容故事的編排未能盡善、同時各緊張塲面，也皆未能儘量發揮、對於盜匪　的行爲動作的描寫、失敗多於成功、演員之支配也不甚適合、除劉瓊有相當成甚之外、顧蘭君和洪警鈴沒就戲做、徐華園的陳査禮。面部化裝頗能近似、但動作方面的摹仿則尙未談得　、</p>

<p>— 秋楊</p>
<p>低矮的房子，瓦面上堆積着幾分　的黃麕，住民通通搬到鄉下去了！讓屋頂被×人的大炮轟開了洞，或轟穿了墻壁，尤其是東邊近車站的一帶，不知是飛機上的炸彈，還是黃河對岸飛過來的大礅，　裏的人逃避不及，　還管他媽的礅彈或炸彈，他們只能永遠記着的是我們的房屋被日本鬼炸壞的。</p>
<p>這兒是潼關；據　陜豫三省的疆界，是西北主要的屏藩，在這裏有着不少的光榮的歷史，二扇雄壯的城樓矗立着，雖然據說曾因減少×人目標而折　了一部份，但究竟還在黃河岸邊脾睨視着一切。</p>
<p>天，像要下雪的樣子，濃重的彤雲，密佈着遼闊的長空，朔風像利剪一般的剪來，襲着戰士們的肌膚，還帶着一陣陳中人欲嘔的硝硫味，從城外的山上，帶到這空無人跡的城裏。</p>
<p>黃河從北迎面下來，到這裏轉一個灣，向東奔流，沿着河的南岸跨過隴海路幾里的山邊，無數英勇的健兒，埋伏在堅固的工事下面，礅兵們却不停地，把礅彈運送到射擊的手裏，濃烈的硝煙，跟雷鳴也似的聲響，使每一個戰士，振奮着愉快和興奮。忘記了寒冷。忘記了疲倦。</p>
<p>『轟擊×人的砲位，發現了！快！』</p>
<p>『三十五度，傾斜描準！」</p>
<p>營長舒着望遠鏡，興奮地跳着，喊着，接着他自己放下了望遠鏡，測量適當的角度，呌礅手射擊。</p>
<p>×人的砲彈，也像發現了這兒的砲位，砲彈落到一百米突的地方爆裂，破片山石，跟着黃黑的灰塵，四面飛着，一個二個，打在結實的黃土上，成了幾個深坑，營長的馬受傷了，嘶叫着跳了起來，肚子上流出鮮血，跟着三個傳令兵也倒下去，腦袋飛去一片，兩手向空幾抓了一抓，兩脚　顫地動了次，什麽聲息也沒有，血泊裏浸着他死了的屁首。</p>
<p>大礅矗然的向着對岸開去，那邊黃色荒凉的占渡頭，同樣的飛起黃塵，冲向着天空。</p>
<p>營長興奮的跳了起來。「對了，媽媽的！再開，！把望遠鏡握在左手，右手握着堆在地上的咆彈。</p>
<p>礅手們流出熱汗，興奮得臉都紅了。</p>
<p>許久，×人的砲沒有打過來了，這里又停止開砲，營長安靜的囘過頭來，向死去的傳令兵，立正俯首沈　着，砲兵們也都立起來，向死者致悲壯的哀悼。</p>
<p>北岸，一片荒涼，遠處有黑色的東西，像毀壞的車輛，在停着不動一動地，河裏流活着黃濁的泥水，南岸的隴海路，跟山勢彎着身子，繞過山後，寂寞的大地，有不見一　人，潼關安詳地矗立着，這時候雪，開始飄落下來了。</p>
<h3 id="c86">蘇聯的一個「桂冠詩人」 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 陳適懷</p>
<p>在革命初期，詩人D白德納，無疑是蘇聯詩壇的一顆頂亮的星，「桂冠詩人」　個榮銜是屬於他的。可是，作家的浮沉，正如社會的波動一樣，那是無可避免的，在一九二三年後，蘇聯開始了一個普羅詩歌的寫　期，這個『桂冠詩人』的眩耀的榮銜，便落在一個年靑詩人的身上，這個年靑詩人就是倍滋敏斯基（Bexymensky），倍氏對政治有深刻的認識，而思想又驚人地堅定，他的主題竟沒有一點傳統的傷感；讓別人想到春天吧！他說道；</p>
<p>可是我行啊行的，而固執地</p>
<p>想到蘇維埃食物的本錢</p>
<p>或者：</p>
<p>有人掛懷着女孩子的嘴唇，</p>
<p>而我掛懷着煙突，</p>
<p>他就是那麼一個硬性和冷靜的男子，但生活之對于他，有一種美好的滋味，他最初出的一本書，便叫做『那就是生活如何滋味』。</p>
<p>倍氏的作風，與稍早期的象徵派所影響的「鍛冶塲」集團等人，顯出不同，他的作品，近似馬也可夫斯基的。馬也可夫斯基那種粗野，誇張的語法，他是完全接受來下。不過，當馬也可夫斯基自殺了以後，他又罵了馬氏一頓。這就是說，他是用一種批判的態度　學習馬也可夫斯基</p>
<p>他在一九三〇年所寫的戲劇詩『射擊』表露了他對政治的一種尖銳的認識。在五年計劃那個時期，他是作爲一個最熱誠擁護政府的政策的作家。如長詩『悲慘之夜』及『政治部主任之夜』等、題材都是涉及五年計劃的。所以，有人說倍氏的成功是在于政治，而不是在於詩歌。其實他的成功還有另外的一個因素，那就是他寫詩常常亟力要做到「大衆化」。他在路上，播昔台的旁邊，戲院的廂座裏　寫詩；而不是在房間裏。他的詩歌之所以能馳譽全國，不能不說是由於蘇聯人衆的熱烈歡迎。</p>

<p>他這魚行是兩開間的門面，舖面因爲很空，我們在這邊休息那實是最合適的地方。這魚行，倒是很像一家「託拉斯』，所有外來的魚担子，全要祖到行里來，再往外賣，我們沒有看見一個担子在街上單獨賣魚的。這樣的特殊產物的剝削方法，在鄕村中還是第一次的　見。卽使你攔住担子想跟那漁人直接交易，他還死搖着頭不肯呢。當地的人很喜歡吃魚，魚價確很便宜。早晨，魚行門口擠滿人，賣魚老板高站在條桌上，專管稱魚，另外有收錢的，有照料祖子的。</p>
<p>『三百啊！』那老板稱完魚，這樣拉長了尾普喊了一聲之後，買魚人就端着籃子把稱上的魚收了去，然後，到收鋪人那邊交上錢。永是這樣一個程序，人們就在鬧熱中來來去去。老板的喊聲，響澈了整個街面：</p>
<p>『一角啊！——』</p>
<p>『四百啊！——』</p>
<p>還記得上次來這宿營力時候　人在前一天走得乏乏的，夜里讓蚊子咬得十分難受，實指望早晨這一刻好好睡睡，却不料全被這喊聲吵醒了。</p>
<p>今天，今天是響午時分，這交易早經收場了。</p>
<p>新花生上市了，堆得一堆一堆的，館子里的薰肉，那汁味才够誘人呢。當了兵，你就想不到變成怎樣的　兎，那正如當了兵，咀邊就掛上『他嗎的』這一類字樣，全是少不了的現象。但是摸摸自己的袋子，空得只裝一疊草紙，便對什麽都　望了。不，還會另想辦法的。</p>
<p>「老張，請客！」</p>
<p>「說罷。」</p>
<p>伸手指指飯館門口案板上陳設的食物，在期待着答覆。</p>

<p>徐州突圍回憶記徐州突圍囘憶記</p>
<p>經了半大的激戰，昨夜九點鐘才趕到徐蘆，想在夜間我們通過徐蘆時，給我們一陣襲擊的×人，遣棄了三四百具的死屍，和不少的槍彈，狼狽逃跑了。</p>
<p>分拿着奪獲戰利品，隊伍浩浩蕩蕩地的便繼續前進</p>
<p>天晴朗得一片雲也沒有，太陽怪火辣辣的，路上沙土被炙得像一口燒紅了的鐵鍋，田野裏的麥苗在太陽的温柔的撫換下，靜靜的在躺着。</p>
<p>一點風也沒有，頂着一枝樹枝，拖着泡破了又起了泡，第二次的泡破了又起泡的兩隻疼痛不堪的脚，一顚一拐地走在那燙得要命的土路上。口渴得要命，汗不住的只是流。</p>
<p>一隻×機忽然出現在天空裏，前進着的人馬，立刻便掩藏在樹下和麥田裏去。</p>
<p>×機在頭頂上盤旋了一轉，無結果便飛開了，於是，人馬又匯台成一條鐵流，前進着。</p>
<p>只要一遇到水，卽使是那末汚穢的。人便像一窠蜂似的圍攏了起來，爭着吃着。</p>
<p>已經到了下午五點多鐘，到了渦陽縣的第四區。這是一個還相當寬大的古城，但早已成空，一個老百姓也沒有了。據說，在一個星期以前，敵人曾佔領過此地，城外還遺留着敵人安置的電話綫……。</p>
<p>在城內找不到甚麽吃的。帶着幾人來沒有得好好的睡過一夜，粗吃過一頓飯的難耐的飢餓和疲乏，便到城外的一座長十餘丈，寬二丈餘的石橋，坐着等着隊伍出發。</p>
<p>這時，太陽剛落入地平綫下去，西方的天空是一抹燦爛的紅霞，晚風帶着使人輕快淸凉，徐徐的在吹着裏橋下是過河的半河淸水，有三四隻主人不知已逃到那裏去的鴨子，自由地在河裏優游着。</p>
<p>望着這富有詩　的景物，天天在戰鬥的生活中道日子的一顆緊張的心，忽然變得悠閒起來，我們幾乎忘了是在突圍了。</p>
<p>突然，一羣人馬從橋上走了過來，這裏面有東北軍，川軍，廣西軍，……望着他們艱難的，像一些小脚婦人，扭着腰肢走路的模樣，我差點忍不住笑　來。</p>
<p>其實，我們走路的模樣，同他們也並沒有兩樣，但我們忘記了自己的痛苦了。</p>
<p>過了半夜，在明亮的月光下，隊伍就沿着公路，嚴肅地向渦陽出發。</p>

<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>誰也不用担心一個文化的毀滅。一個文化的誕生和生長，雖然是一件極不容易的事，但它的保存和冉生，却是很爲簡單的。因爲它可以保存在知識內，而通過知識冉生幷不難。</p>
<p>保存文化的最精微的東西，是人類的腦筋，一付幷無需十分超卓的現代人的活動的腦子，所能再生的文化，大致總不難使五百年前乃至二百年前的的我們同類驚奇，假使人類能仿制出腦這樣微妙的機械，而且是留聲戡，攝影機，似地可以輾轉留傳下去的，則古人所意想的。『宇宙萬象，盡羅此方寸間』那一囘事，眞可以實現。</p>
<p>有人說過，任何人都能寫一本書。這是把書的含義加上限制來講的，若是請每人把一切所知道，從如何摘蘋果到如何接無綫電綫，都寫出來，則每人決不止能著作等身。誰也知道，若眞地每人都寫出來，則那些內容十九相同的著作的產生，將是不必要的絕大的浪費；但幾乎誰也沒有壞疑過，每個人腦中，都逐漸存儲起和別人十九相同的知識那似是必要的浪費，是否錯誤？自然，也曾有人說過，一具優越的頭腦，不是能比一般人記憶得多，而是能把無須記着的都忘去。但這僅被人看作一句奇語罷了。</p>
<p>作爲人類之誇的，能相互傳達複雜的意義這一特殊技能，因爲它是最後取得，其進程實在很短。我們所有的傳達意義的工具，實是都還很笨，而保留下以供冉　達的工具尤其笨，把披樹葉的原始人復活過來，他們將不明瞭我們的人造絲（拉絨）的服裝；把巢居穴處的史前人復活過來，他似不明瞭我們的摩天樓建築，但把讀磚塊書，草紙書的巴比倫人，埃及復活過來，請他們看一看我們的華　，洋册他們一定能毫不遲疑地指出，這是書。</p>
<p>我們可以永遠保存，使用的腦，來保存文化；我們比較所最依賴的，還是書籍，這自然使我們的保存工作，比較累贅，但比之嬰把一切文化產品，全部原樣保留，却也已便利不少。很多已消失的文化物，我們都不難靠書本知識，使其再現，我們所以不那樣做的原故，大概只因已把它們放在應該忘記的之列。自然也有人簡直不承認有可以及得原作的仿製品，可是那僅是一種迷信，這迷信是和天才自尋出路那另一信心，同時存在的。旣然目的是在超越前人，則和前人的相差，自然不是趕不上，而是把他們拋落。只有講究古董的人所稱讀的古色古香，那是時間造成的，後人在時間上當然要吃虧。可是十年埋製的假古董，其古色古香，也往往足以亂眞，則時間多少也是被控制了，已消失的古文化的再發掘，雖然現在還是文化工作的一部，但那些再發掘出的東西，頗有是預備再拋棄的，而同時其他方面的拋棄，更是大量的進行。</p>
<p>到必要的情形下，保存文化的工具—書籍，也是要被拋棄的，其中的一部分，被拋棄的原因，就在其本身。這供給我們以保存的上便利，也暴露了我們工具方面的弱點，且恐怕同時還隱約透出我們不滿足於這些工具的心理，道心理將是進步之源，不過它也難免沒有錯誤，我們現在實又不難把錯誤減到最小。就書籍這一工具的保存說，縱然自有賽籍以來的出品，每種都有一份存在，大槪也不會是多大的數量。而我們若全部把他保存，也不致感多大的累贅。</p>
<p>又要想到是怎樣一個數字了。在自己這一件很平常的頭腦裏，記不得首在那裏見過，也不知道，可在那裏找到一個答案。不過記得在一次空談中，曾有人提出『恐怕自有書籍以來，人類還不曾寫出一千萬種騰吧？」的奇問。這問題也空談了相當時間，感覺不止此數的朋友方面，舉出美國國會圖書館就藏有書籍雜誌等約九百萬卷册，以及英，美，德，法，俄數國，每年各有新出版書籍一萬全二萬種，若其他各國所出合共有五國所出的總數之半，卽每年在十萬種以上，二十世紀來，每年大致都運此數量，是二十世紀已有了四百萬種新書了，何況以前還有四十幾世紀呢。感覺或止此數的人則以爲，把一千萬種給五十世紀平均，也得一世紀二十萬種，試設這爲公元前第五世紀中的產量，然誰也不會覺得太少。截前補後、便估算十九世紀有二百萬種新書，也在够分配之內，而且若姑定量是有相當大小，以三百頁二十萬字算作一本，小册合作總集，（如新舊約）全集配成分册，重複的不計，則二十世紀，就未必已達百萬冊的數量。是一千萬這數目够大了。</p>
<p>如果我們寧信後說，則其體積不過一萬立方公尺，重量不過一萬噸，價値不過五千萬元，照中國影印西書的承印價，每種印一百本，總計也只要二十萬萬元，還不到美國印刷業一年的開支的五分之一。這數量幾乎小得可憐吧。假使都只僅存一分，而又能聚在一起來將它毀滅，眞不需要一個百磅炸彈。然而數量小，則保存容易，有一個角落，就可以　起一份，而逃出毀滅的力量。我們可以相信，縱使世界將再有洪水浩刦，就也將冉有保持文化的挪亞方舟，而那方舟實也已經够大。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Japanese Military Clique's Fear <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invaders demanded that the world's nations recognize the so-called "New Order in East Asia" that it had forcibly created, and received strong rebuttals from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, not only have Japanese politicians and bureaucrats heard of this and become greatly alarmed, but even the frenzied and unrestrained Japanese military clique has also become terrified. The spiritual and economic sanctions against Japan by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, due to the active advocacy of the United States, have gradually been put on the agenda for implementation. This is what we have repeatedly discussed in our articles over the past month. Recently, U.S. President Roosevelt has also submitted a bill to Congress, requesting the construction and arming of twelve new naval bases, including Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, major ports in Alaska and Florida, as well as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. In particular, the construction of Guam is even more active. The Japanese military circles have heard of this and are very alarmed. The Ministry of the Navy has recently issued a booklet, and reading its contents reveals its flustered and hurried state. However, after examining the situation from all aspects, this is not without reason.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of the Navy's booklet first states that Japan is currently facing a major crisis, namely, that Japan must cope with the combined forces of the British, American, French, and Soviet navies; these four countries are using their strong naval power as a backing for China's resistance against Japan. The booklet also stated that "if Japan wants to build a new order in the Far East, it now has difficulties both at sea and on land" (according to a dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th). These are the honest words of the Japanese invaders. Japan is an island nation, and since the middle of the Meiji period, it has been renowned in the world for its navy. Its several external wars of aggression have certainly relied most on the army, but the role of the navy has also occupied an important position. For example, there have been repeated operations by naval landing forces. Subsequently, as its international dangers gradually expand into the stage of World War II, the importance of its navy will increase even more. The Japanese military clique originally planned to use the army to deal with China and the Soviet Union, and the navy to deal with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. In the past ten years, Japan has actively expanded its navy to the maximum limit of the naval treaty, while the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have slightly relaxed their military preparedness, which has led Japan to believe that its army and navy are sufficient to run rampant in the world. However, in recent years, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, in view of the increasingly tense situation in the Pacific and Europe, have rapidly caught up in terms of naval equipment; especially in the Pacific, they have built solid naval bases, such as the Soviet Union's in Vladivostok, the United Kingdom's in Singapore, France's in Annam, and the United States' in the Philippines, etc. When the naval forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are fully equipped, they will not only be an overwhelming force for Japan, but also form a surrounding situation for it. This is just as the Japanese Ministry of the Navy's booklet says, the United States' naval plan is enough to make the United States the most alarming naval nation in the world, the United Kingdom's naval plan will allow the United Kingdom to create a naval force of two million tons by 1942, and the Soviet Union's submarine fleet is the largest in the world.</p>
<p>The construction of the strong naval forces of the four civilized nations of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is entirely aimed at defending against aggressive nations that deliberately disrupt world peace, especially targeting Japanese imperialism, which has been running rampant in the Pacific in recent years. Therefore, the recent naval construction of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union has coincided in concentrating on the Pacific. Recently, there have been two facts that have further alarmed Japan. The first is the Soviet Union's naval equipment. After the "September 18th Incident," Japan focused all its energy on the connection between the Japanese archipelago and the Chinese mainland, so it invested huge sums to reform the ports of western Japan, open up new ports in northern Korea, and shorten the sea route from important mainland cities to Japan. Since the successful construction of Rajin, Chongjin, and Unggi ports, Japan's efforts have achieved considerable success. However, this achievement will be completely eliminated in the future due to the activities of the Soviet Union's strong "submarine fleet" in Vladivostok (according to the above-mentioned booklet, the Soviet Union has designated 60 ships for use in the Far East). The Soviet Union is not satisfied with the "world's largest submarine fleet," and it will also "build two 35,000-ton battleships and seven 8,000-ton cruisers" (above-mentioned booklet). It is an extremely difficult task for Japan to seize Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Second, the United States' construction of new naval bases in the Pacific poses an even greater threat to Japan. Japan deeply knows the importance of the Pacific in the future world war, so after the European War, it insisted on seizing the South Seas Mandate. The several islands of Japan's South Seas Mandate originally had no economic value, but Japan strived to obtain them, and its significance lies in the military, because these islands are located in the middle of the Pacific, and to the north, they can be connected to Japan's mainland by the Ogasawara Islands as a bridge, and to the west, they can be connected to its colony of Taiwan, so that its naval power can be exerted in the Pacific. However, the United States' subsequent rapid construction of naval bases not only adopted a surrounding shape for Japan's entire naval base, but also prepared to build Guam to directly attack the heart of this naval base. Guam is located in the middle of Japan's South Seas Mandate, about 1,500 miles from eastern Japan and the Philippines. If the United States' naval construction in the Philippines and Guam is successful, it will be enough to destroy the connection between Japan and the South Seas Mandate, then Japan's naval power will not only be greatly reduced, but also have the possibility of being blockaded near the three islands of Japan, and several large cities on Japan's land will be bombed by the planes of various countries, eventually leading to collapse.</p>
<p>As British naval experts have said: "The victory or defeat of future wars depends on the strength of the navy" (London Daily Telegraph). The prediction that the Japanese military clique will inevitably be defeated has gained a new argument.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Experience of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in Crushing the Enemy's Encirclement - A General's Remarks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(1) Full Preparation and Calm, Resolute Response</p>
<p>First, the border region has made full preparations to oppose the enemy's encirclement. They know that the border region was produced, grew, and became solid under the enemy's encirclement. Before the Japanese invaders are driven out of China, the enemy will not forget to attack the border region for a moment. Especially as the border region expands and consolidates, and continues to achieve military victories, the harm and threat to the enemy increase, the enemy will not give up its attempts to "mop up" the border region. Therefore, they believe that in the process of the border region's consolidation, development, and continuous victories, even if the regime becomes increasingly consolidated, all construction is on track, and social order and local security are gradually restored, it still cannot be considered a "long-term and stable" "comfortable nest." Therefore, they constantly raise their vigilance, preparing to respond to the enemy's attack at any time, and actively attack the enemy. They have repeatedly put forward slogans such as "oppose the concept of peace" and "everything is suitable for the war environment" to raise public awareness and not be麻醉 by temporary peace. At the same time, all work and daily life in the border region are carried out under the slogans of tension, speed, hard work, depth, practicality, planning, and swiftness, all suitable for the war environment. Ready to respond to the enemy's new offensive at any time. Therefore, generally speaking, when the enemy launched a large-scale offensive against the border region this time, the people, regime, army, and all social organizations in the border region were able to calmly and resolutely take all steps to oppose the enemy's counterattack, neither panicking and losing control, wavering, or running away, nor being pessimistic and disappointed.</p>
<p>(2) Correct Leadership and Solid Unity</p>
<p>Second, is correct leadership and solid unity. From the beginning of the establishment of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, and in the struggle over the past year, work has been carried out under the correct general policy of the anti-Japanese national united front, uniting every border region people who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. They deeply understand the truth that "at this time of national crisis, the more urgent the situation, the more united the anti-Japanese forces of our entire nation must be, which is the central key to saving the situation." In the past year, all the people, regime, army, and various parties in the border region have been working together with one heart and one mind, fighting together under the central task of consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese base areas. There is generally little "friction" between them, and even less "those close to us grieve, those who hate us rejoice" incidents occur. Although the enemy has never given up its "scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese; creating rumors, provoking separation, organizing puppet organizations, fabricating facts, framing the border region regime and army, expelling traitors and bandits from the border region, carrying out various schemes, attempting to split the unity of the border region people, regime, and army, this attempt has been defeated under the solid unity of the border region people, regime, and army. At the same time, in the past year, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has indeed done a lot of great work. Under the principle of "resistance against Japan is above all else," the political institutions have undergone relatively proper reforms, and democratic politics, improvement of people's livelihood, and national crisis education have generally been realized, thereby further enhancing the determination of the broad masses and the army to resist Japan, and the confidence to adhere to a protracted war and strive for final victory. At the same time, it has also increasingly increased the people's support and love for the regime, and mutual unity, especially manifested in times of war urgency, and in the face of large-scale encirclements, although the enemy has made full preparations, political mobilization, and tried every possible means to split the unity of the border region, and after entering the border region, searched everywhere for the masses to "publicize," and even used money to buy them off, attempting to crudely organize "maintenance associations," but they have never been able to establish them. The activities of traitors within the border region are extremely weak.</p>
<p>(3) Using Combined Assaults to Crush the Enemy's "Divided Advance and Combined Attack"</p>
<p>Third, is the dynamic tactics of our troops. The border region troops have adopted guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare in their operations against the enemy's encirclement. The terrain conditions and the people's conditions in the border region are very favorable to the border region army's operations. When the enemy began to advance on a large scale towards the center of the border region from all directions, the border region's troops skillfully launched separate突擊 against the enemy invading the border region. More than 4,000 enemy troops advancing from Yuxian County to Kewuhe were迎擊 by our powerful unit in the areas of Bailanquanxia Gengjiazhuang, etc., and fought bloody battles for four days and nights, killing or wounding about 2,000 enemy troops, including the Shimizu Regiment Commander. The enemy advancing toward　Qiu from Guang灵 was阻击 by another unit of our army in the Zhigukou Fengjiawan area, and fought fiercely for six days and nights, killing more than 800 enemy troops. More than 500 enemy troops advancing from Yixian County to Laiyuan were attacked by our army in the Wangan area, and completely annihilated. When the enemy entered the border region, although they occupied certain towns and transportation hubs, the enemy's attempt to wipe out our active forces by "dividing and attacking" completely failed. That is, in the end, the "mopping up" from Wutai, Fuping, and Taihuai towards Gengzhen and Shizui, in addition to suffering constant attacks and casualties along the way, abandoning corpses and wounded soldiers, and fleeing in a panic, also achieved nothing. Therefore, although the enemy's plan was meticulous and the means were毒辣, under the flexible maneuverability of our army and the opposition to the enemy's invasion by the entire people, even if the enemy penetrated deep into the border region and occupied certain cities, towns, and key roads, they still could not limit our maneuverability. On the contrary, the border region troops were still able to continue to strike at the enemy who had penetrated deep into various areas with ease and constantly achieve victories. At the same time, in the enemy's rear communication lines, powerful units and guerrillas of our army constantly appeared in their depths. The roads were destroyed, and the retreating troops did not dare to move because they were constantly attacked by our army. The enemy guarding the strongholds also did not dare to leave the strongholds because they were constantly raided and besieged by our army. The enemy's Regiment Commander Chongzheng Ya was killed by a sudden attack by our strike team in Sangshang Hunanjin, an area that had already been "mopped up" by the enemy. At the same time, the Zhengtai Road, Pinghan Road, PingSui Road, and Tongpu Road were also constantly destroyed by our army. As a result, the situation of the enemy and us changed, giving the enemy who encircled the border region and the enemy who divided and attacked a combined assault, so that the enemy who had penetrated deep into the border region had to give up the attempt to continue the offensive. This is excellent maneuverability, a characteristic of the strategic tactics in the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>(4) Resolute and Protracted Operations Finally Threw the Enemy into the Fate of Losing Soldiers and Generals</p>
<p>Fourth, is the决打 against the enemy, the resolute protracted operation. The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region only has a year of history of victory, and the border region armed forces are mostly organized from scattered people's armed organizations. Whether in equipment, training, or other aspects, there are shortcomings, but they have a high degree of political passion and heroic and resolute determination to fight; have unyielding perseverance, and a firm belief in achieving final victory. Therefore, when the enemy attacked the border region with a large force,毒辣 means, and fierce bombing by airplanes and artillery, the young army in our border region was not intimidated. Even when the enemy entered the border region, occupied some cities and towns, and the environment of the border region's struggle temporarily turned into a more serious state, the young border region armed forces remained as stable as Mount Tai, fighting resolutely. In the more than one hundred hard battles, large and small, in the past two months, although they failed to prevent the enemy from entering the border region and have not completely eliminated the enemy who entered the border region to this day, they have indeed made the enemy suffer great losses and sacrifices, sacrificing one brigadier commander, two team leaders, and about 20,000 other officers and soldiers, and finally completely crushed the enemy's plan to "mop up" the border region, throwing the enemy into the tragic fate of losing soldiers and generals.</p>
<p>(5) The Thorough Mobilization of the Masses Gave the Enemy a Great Threat</p>
<p>Fifth, the success of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in crushing the enemy's large-scale encirclement this time is due to the in-depth mobilization of the masses. Because the people in the border region had made full war preparations in "normal times," the mobilization of the masses in this large-scale encirclement by the enemy was very high. Especially the work of emptying the houses and clearing the fields was even more universal and thorough. Food was buried, all tools that cost the enemy were also collected, and all businesses located on the road of the enemy's advance were far away, which gave the enemy great difficulties. They could not find supplies, nor could they find utensils, let alone the masses. They could not inquire about the situation of our army, and there was no one to lead the way. Puppet organizations could not be organized, which made the enemy isolated. Especially after the rear communication line was cut off, they could not last long. Although there are still shortcomings in the participation of the masses in the war, and there are also weaknesses in some work that are not enough for war connection, the general people of the border region have been actively mobilized. They actively and bravely participated in transporting wounded soldiers, transporting food, transporting victory items, and destroying roads: and many people, especially from the suicide squads, took up various kinds of white-blade weapons, or鸟枪士砲, and spontaneously and independently fought with the enemy, or cooperated with guerrillas, etc., scattered in various road　, fields, villages, or mountains, and fought irregular battles with the enemy, giving the enemy a great threat, especially giving them a great shock in spirit.</p>
<p>(6) General Administrative Institutions Can Still Play Their Role in the Encirclement</p>
<p>Sixth is in charge of the regime's work. In this time of the enemy's encirclement of the border region, the administrative efficiency of the border region was weakened due to the urgent war situation or the separation of the regime's connections by the enemy, and there were also a small number of districts and villages and two-level regimes that failed to play a proper role, and even无形解体, but generally speaking, they can still adapt to the war environment, especially the county administrative districts, which have the spirit and determination to fight hard and persevere in the struggle. Even under relatively serious circumstances, they can still carry out administrative work and lead the broad masses to cooperate in combat, or directly lead local armed forces to launch guerrilla warfare. This is indeed the direct result of the thorough reform of the political institutions. It is a world apart from those corrupt officials, 生怕死, and run away at the slightest sound. At the same time, this also proves that in order to maintain the proper effectiveness of the regime's work in the protracted war of resistance, it is only possible to thoroughly strengthen the reform of the political institutions.</p>
<p>(7) A Matter Worthy of Vigilance</p>
<p>Seventh, is something that we must　　. In the border region, there are ××　institutions　,　　after the battle, most of them disintegrated first, some　changed and投了 the enemy, some turned into bandits, and some panicked and fled. Everywhere搶劍民　　caused the old people to suffer a lot. The reason for this is that the organizational composition of these troops is extremely　　, the officers and soldiers　　have the necessary unity, no necessary discipline (or is打　主义) no any training, no minimal political work more no necessary anti-Japanese殺國敎育, so to　such troops, faithfully于抗日救國的伟业, is沒有保陣的. More 该不上 to require them in the bitter and difficult environment, break through and overcome all the困伟, in suffering on conduct坚　protracted war, adhere to strive for independent freedom happy new China. At the same time this also clearly shows　that any troop, if there is没有　good composition points, no necessary unity,没　necessary training, no necessary conscious discipline, no necessary political work, no necessary anti-Japanese救國敎育, to提高民族意识,克服一切不良现象, not only can not guarantee其忠实于抗日救國事业,坚持持久战,不顾一切艰苦困难,不届不挠,再接再励的为独立自出幸福的新中国而奋斗, 无须　经过×人的严重猛烈的进攻, 也要自己解体 或 转变 无或多或少的危害于民族解放事业的.</p>
<p>The above points are all General ××'s actual and brief observations to the reporter on the enemy's large-scale encirclement of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region and the crushing of the enemy's encirclement, but we can already clearly see from here: In this battle, the fighting methods of both the enemy and us have many contents. This is a new experience and lesson since the War of Resistance, and it is also an inevitable product of the increasingly protracted process of the War of Resistance. We must estimate that more new fighting methods will inevitably be produced in the continued development of the War of Resistance. Therefore, studying these experiences and lessons is an extremely meaningful and important thing for the national warriors who adhere to the protracted war, especially for those who adhere to the protracted war behind the enemy lines, prepare to continuously oppose the enemy's encirclement, defeat the enemy's continuous offensives and encirclements, and strive for final victory.

<p>[Lian County Correspondence] Since the reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the position of Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has been taken over by Gu Yiqun. Mr. Gu was originally the president of the Guangdong Provincial Bank and is an economic expert. In the future, Guangdong's finances will be managed by Mr. Gu's talents, and there will surely be achievements. The former director, Zeng Yangfu, initially commanded the tax police regiment in combat after the fall of Guangzhou, and later served as the director of the Xijiang Administrative Office of the Provincial Government. Recently, he was summoned to Chongqing by Generalissimo Chiang and will be appointed to a new position. The transfer of the department to the new appointee is said to be nearing completion. It is reported that the transfer currently includes more than four million yuan in national currency. During the War of Resistance, when expenditures are vast, it is rare to be able to manage so freely and still have such a large sum of surplus funds to transfer. The general public is quite skeptical about this and doubts how it came about. There are noteworthy points in this. Guangdong's finances have always been known to be chaotic. After the prohibition of opium and gambling, annual revenue has fallen short by tens of millions of yuan, which cannot be compensated for. When Director Song Ziliang took office, he felt extremely difficult. Then he resigned due to illness. The authorities believed that Mr. Zeng was rich in construction talent, so they appointed him to take over. At that time, outsiders doubted whether Mr. Zeng could overcome this difficulty. However, he did not hesitate and resolutely accepted the appointment, determined to reform. First, he exempted dozens of kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, and also exempted the old land tax from the 13th to the 23rd years of the Republic of China. Then he reorganized the　 revenue, and just as he was getting started, the War of Resistance broke out, and Guangdong's finances suddenly changed from normal to extraordinary, and a tense state was presented. Mr. Zeng was concerned about increasing the burden on the people on the one hand, and on the other hand, he had to deal with military expenses, so he urgently formulated a wartime financial plan. The basic principles were: (A) not increasing the burden on the people, (B) considering the national position, (C) carefully considering whether the revenue and expenditure of the finances themselves are suitable. The guidelines for its implementation, in terms of system, were: (1) establishing a tax bureau to manage tax administration in various places, (2) independent treasury to collect tax payments exclusively, (3) independent accounting to summarize the amount of revenue and expenditure, in terms of personnel, were: (1) selecting and training tax officials, (2)　dense assessment, (3) safeguarding good officials, (4) strictly punishing corruption, in terms of tax revenue, were: (1) abolishing contractors, (2) improving the old tax system, (3) establishing a wartime luxury goods surtax, (4) implementing a wartime business excess profits tax. After hard work and perseverance for more than a year, he was finally able to lay the foundation for Guangdong Province's wartime finances, and the people and administrative affairs gradually got on track. Revenue increased greatly, so in addition to meeting extraordinary needs, there was still a surplus of funds. Under this serious state, being able to manage in this way and achieve its effect is not to be said that Mr. Zeng's financial management was quite successful. Guangdong's finances have undergone a considerable foundation through this reform, and now that Mr. Gu has succeeded him,　 following the rules and innovating, there must be　reflections, so it can cope with the long-term War of Resistance. It is also what the people of the country and Guangdong are happy to hear. (Zhang)</p>

<h3 id="e4">× Military Leaders Decide to Increase Troops in Central China, Feigning Offensive Against Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 23rd) It is reported that × army and navy generals, in a meeting in Nanjing, decided to reinforce the troops in Central China to fifteen divisions. The "Manchurian" and Korean armies will be transferred to Taiwan for training, with the intention of carrying out a "sweeping" operation against guerrillas in the future, protecting transportation lines, and feigning offensives against Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to contain our forces, while at the same time carrying out indiscriminate bombings, attempting to disrupt our rear lines.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Shanghai office, 23rd] According to foreign news, the Japanese warlords are still determined to go their own way. They are currently organizing a new army of 180,000 men to invade Suiyuan. In the future, they will mostly advance in three routes, with the puppet Manchurian army as the vanguard, the Japanese army in the center, and the flanks led by Chinese generals of the puppet Manchurian army. Currently, there are already over 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops in Suiyuan, and a major battle is imminent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to Chinese military authorities speaking to our reporter, the Japanese army is sending reinforcements to Shanxi from Japan and puppet Manchuria. On the 15th of this month, the Japanese transported twelve 15 cm caliber field guns from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan. These are heavy artillery pieces transported from the Japanese mainland. It is also said that the Japanese troops stationed in Taiyuan and Yuci have strengthened their defenses to prepare for sudden attacks by Chinese guerrillas. In small cities like Yuci, the Japanese troops stationed there now number 15,000. Chinese reports also indicate that several Italian military technical experts have arrived in Taiyuan from Japan. Furthermore, it is said that the Japanese 7th Division has now received orders to be the main force for the next invasion of southwestern Hebei, replacing the Nakajima Division, which was the main force for the previous invasion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Hekou, 22nd] Puppet troops and × bandits are increasingly at odds. The puppet head, Zhi Chongyu, of the Qian Di Pi regiment, led a mutiny of the entire regiment a few days ago, killing a × commander and retreating east to Guyang. Furthermore, part of the puppet 18th Regiment was dissatisfied with × and has been disbanded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Huaiyin, 23rd] Five hundred × soldiers of the Jiangyin × army mutinied a few days ago, killing the × commander, and engaged in widespread arson, murder, and looting. The people suffered a great calamity. Later, × troops were transferred from Wuxi to suppress the mutiny, and the rebellious soldiers were escorted onto ships and transported to Shanghai. It is reported that the cause of the mutiny was war-weariness, homesickness, arrears of pay, and internal strife.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Situation in Western Shanxi Turns Favorable; Our Forces Encircle and Control ×, Frequent Troop Movements on the Datong-Puzhou Railway Line <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 23rd) The × forces in the occupied areas have been quite active recently. Our troops have launched guerrilla warfare and achieved considerable victories. The Jiangsu-Shandong × forces have taken no action. Traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is sometimes blocked and sometimes open. The × forces in the counties of western Shanxi have adopted a defensive posture, and the fighting has slowed down compared to before. We are using encirclement and flanking tactics to control the × forces on all routes. The × forces on the Datong-Puzhou Railway are very busy with military transport. Fierce battles are raging near Hejin.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Xi'an office, 23rd] The × forces in Hejin are surrounded and are in a desperate struggle. All lines of communication have been cut off by us. The 24th and 108th Divisions will be annihilated soon. The × 1st, 109th, and 110th Divisions in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, totaling a regiment, have been scattered after our counter-offensive.</p>
<p>[Min Ge She dispatch from Dianji, 23rd] There is no activity in Zhongyang and Lishi. In recent days, 500 × troops from Fenyang have been reinforced to Zhongli. They are all veterans aged 35 to 40. Among them are over 300 Chinese from Huaiping, and their weapons are very incomplete, with some even carrying spears. Desertions by private soldiers are reported daily.</p>
<p>[Min Ge She dispatch from Xingji, 23rd] There has been fierce fighting between × and our forces in the area of Yanbo Village between Wu'an and Handan. × suffered over 300 casualties and reinforcements were successively dispatched from Handan. Fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Min Ge She dispatch from Jingle, 23rd] (1) People from Hekou say that the situation in Taiyuan city is very uneasy. The puppet government has not paid salaries for three months, so morale is extremely low. In remote streets and alleys, incidents of Chinese people and × soldiers being killed by our people are frequently discovered. Our guerrillas are active within ten miles of the city. At night, clear gunfire can be heard in the city. (2) On the night of the 14th, our troops attacked Dongyezhen (south of Wutai), killing over ten × soldiers. The × forces are very frightened in the Hebian area.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Shanghai office, 24th] The × forces in Puxi are very busy with troop movements. They have repeatedly launched attacks against our army in recent days, probing our strength. They have been repelled by our army's courageous resistance. Fierce battles are currently raging in Lishi and Zhongyang. Our army launches night attacks and captures many supplies.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to a Chinese military spokesman speaking to our reporter, the Japanese military operations in the past four or five weeks to clear out the Chinese military forces in southern Hebei, western Hebei, and the area between the Fen River and the Yellow River have now failed. This is because the Chinese forces have defeated the Japanese forces and recaptured the strongholds at the Yellow River crossings such as Fugu and Yumen. The Chinese forces immediately recovered Jixian University and Xiangning and other places. The Japanese forces retreated to Lingshi, Puxian, Zhongyang and other counties. The Japanese invasion of Shaanxi two weeks ago was extremely tense and has now been relieved. At the same time, the victorious Chinese guerrillas have expanded eastward to the Datong-Puzhou Railway. However, the Japanese forces in Shanxi still plan to make efforts to advance into the above-mentioned cities in order to clear out the guerrillas. Therefore, the Japanese forces in Taiyuan are now concentrating five Japanese divisions and several Mongolian puppet divisions to attack the Chinese forces on the east bank of the Yellow River such as Jixian and Daning.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from our Wuzhou office, 23rd] The × forces in Guangdong province, considering the dangerous terrain and dense water mines of the West River, making it difficult to invade Wuzhou, and also considering changing their plan to Nanning, have been fiercely bombing the Qinzhou area northwest of Beihai in recent days. × warships and troop transports are also concentrated around Tuzhou Island, all signs of an invasion of Nanning. The reason why they have not launched yet is probably because the × cabinet is still undecided, and the weak military strength near Guangzhou also makes them dare not act rashly. Currently, the × mechanized units are mostly concentrated in Jiujiang, waiting for the right opportunity to move towards Kaiping, Sihui, Taishan, and Xinhui, because the terrain there is mostly flat and easy to maneuver.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Wengyuan, 23rd] More than 2,000 × troops have successively landed on Tuzhou Island. Every day, in groups of three to five, they go to villages to loot property and rape women. ×× above the age of twelve are not spared.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Sihui, 23rd] Our troops in Mafang occasionally cross the river to attack ×, who are uneasy and are building fortifications for defense in the area near Lan Gang in recent days.</p>
<p>[Foreign dispatch from Aomen Dou, 23rd] According to reliable information received here, several French warships have been ordered to sail from Haiphong to Guangzhou. It is also said that last night about ten Japanese gunboats were patrolling the port of Guangzhou. The French authorities are now trying to prepare for the Japanese to land near Guangzhou.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Fancheng, 22nd] The Liuzhi area in southeastern Huangpi is where × stores ammunition. On the 13th, many of our aircraft went to bomb it. In addition to killing many × soldiers, all of the × ammunition was destroyed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to Chinese sources, yesterday sixteen Japanese bombers went to bomb northern Shaanxi. Yan'an, the location of the border region government, and Luochuan, on the Xi'an-Yan'an highway, were also bombed, killing over twenty civilians.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Huaiyin, 23rd] A squadron of our air force flew to Yangzhou on the morning of the 12th and dropped many bombs outside Nandou, destroying many × vehicles and × ammunition depots, and killing many × soldiers. The × army in Yangzhou was extremely frightened.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Chongqing Air Raid Shelters to be Completed This Summer, Able to Accommodate 100,000 People <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] The new, most modern air-raid shelter being built here, which goes deep into the rock strata for 4,100 meters, will be completed this summer. At that time, in the event of an air-raid warning, 100,000 of Chongqing's 700,000 residents will be able to quickly take shelter in the tunnel. Once the war ends, the tunnel can also be used for peacetime purposes. According to records, Japanese planes have crossed over Chongqing five times, but there has only been one mass bombing, so Chongqing is considered relatively safe. Chongqing's climate is unfavorable, with clouds and fog almost every day, so Japanese planes cannot easily carry out air raids unless the sun is bright. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units outside the city often fire when Japanese planes come to attack, but the most recent time was an exception. Furthermore, Chinese fighter planes often stay on the ground without taking off, so that the × planes cannot know their exact location. In addition, the × planes must fly particularly high when attacking to avoid the Chinese planes' counterattack, so their bombing cannot be very accurate. Furthermore, the high-speed × planes, even if they take off from Hankou, cannot have a very long range. Once they reach Chongqing, they must rely on the weapons they carry to defend themselves. The tunnel was started on "August 13th" of last year. Unfortunately, due to a lack of excavators, the completion date has to be postponed to this summer. Otherwise, it could have been completed by February of this year. The tunnel has twenty entrances, the main entrance being called "Guanyin Cave." The tunnel is one and a half meters wide, and the domed ceiling is from ten to thirty meters above the ground. The tunnel is equipped with ten ventilators, each with five to ten horsepower, as well as generators and loudspeakers to spread news. After the war ends, the tunnel can be used as a pedestrian tunnel, which will be much more convenient as there will be no need to go through Chongqing's uneven streets. The tunnel will cost a total of 700,000 yuan in national currency, of which the Ministry of Finance has allocated 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] Approximately 30,000 Chongqing residents leave the city every day to cross the Jialing River to the north in order to avoid air raids.</p>

<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] Senior officials of the Chinese government are very optimistic when discussing the daily news of the war, especially regarding British loans. However, senior officials close to President Kong, when asked about this, replied that they did not have the freedom to tell the reporters about this matter. Political and financial circles seem very confident of obtaining British loans, but the exact amount is still unknown. Observers say that British and American loans to China are a sign of opposition to Japanese military aggression.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Manila, 23rd] The Chinese Consul General in the Philippines and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce here jointly hosted a banquet for the governors and mayors of the provinces of the Philippines who came to Manila for a meeting. During the banquet, the Chinese Consul General, Ou Guangsheng, delivered a speech, saying that China and the Philippines should maintain close relations.

<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 22nd] The position of Japan in diplomatic and military affairs has recently been commented on by various German newspapers. Among them, the Frankfurter Zeitung stated that in view of the various decisions taken by the US government, the position of Japan is particularly worrying. The US authorities have now decided to set up defensive fortifications on islands in the Pacific, so Japan is in danger of being militarily encircled. Moreover, US actions are not limited to this. For example, the three countries of the US, Britain and France sent notes with strong language to Japan. The two countries of Britain and America lent money to China. All of this is clearly very unfavorable to Japan. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published a cartoon, marking the various naval bases that the US government plans to build, and stated that according to President Roosevelt's plan, it can be seen that the US has intentions to advance in the southeastern direction. This move is unfavorable to Japan, and even more obvious. The Tokyo side was greatly shocked by this. The will of the Washington government is to exert heavy pressure on Japan. This cannot be opposed by the American people. Since the internal turmoil in the Soviet Union has emerged one after another, resulting in weakened national strength, its offensive against various totalitarian countries, that is, the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, has been replaced by the United States.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to foreign news from Tokyo, the Japanese Army Ministry announced that the bill to extend the term of reserve service for the Japanese Army and Navy will be submitted to the current session of the Diet for discussion. The Army reserve service will be extended by five years, the Navy's reserve service by one year, and the auxiliary reserve service by two years.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, 23rd] In an editorial today, the Kokumin Shimbun, the newspaper of the Japanese warlords, stated that for the sake of world peace, the Japanese government should change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. This agreement would enable Japan to eliminate aid to China from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and end the war against China as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 23rd] According to diplomatic circles, if the Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet really concludes a military alliance with Germany and Italy and becomes estranged from Britain and the United States, then all democratic countries will inevitably cooperate with the Soviet Union to prevent the growth of Japanese power.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Mr. Li Genyuan, the Cultivator of Our Country's Military Leaders – A Visit Record <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— By Li Baoquan, our special correspondent in Kunming</p>
<p>There is a notable elder in Yunnan now, and that is Mr. Li Yinquan (Genyuan).</p>
<p>Mr. Li founded the "Military Academy" in Kunming in the first year of the Xuantong reign of the deposed Qing Dynasty. At that time, Mr. Li held the position of Director of the Military Academy. Many of the political talents who came out of it are now extremely well-known throughout the country, such as the late Mr. Zhu Peide, and Mr. Zhu De, the leader of the Eighth Route Army. These were all students of the first class. Later, Mr. Li continued to run the Military Academy in Shaozhou, Guangdong. Students there included the late Mr. Guo Songling and Mr. Sheng Shicai, the current governor of Xinjiang. All of them also came from Mr. Li's tutelage. There are many other generals and officers currently serving as army commanders and division commanders in the country. It can truly be said that "students are all over the world." When the August 13th Anti-Japanese War broke out, Mr. Li was living in seclusion in Suzhou. When our army withdrew from Suzhou, Mr. Li had no choice but to withdraw with the army. After arriving in Hankou, his student Sheng Shicai, the governor of Xinjiang, specially sent a plane from Xinjiang to pick him up. However, because the terrain in Xinjiang was too high and the air was extremely thin, it was not suitable for Mr. Li's health. As a result, he suffered from heart failure and his condition was extremely dangerous. He had no choice but to leave Xinjiang. At that time, Long Yun, the chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, learned that Mr. Li had left Xinjiang due to illness, so he sent a welcoming telegram inviting Mr. Li to return to his hometown. Mr. Li also believed that during this period of resistance against Japan, Yunnan's relationship with the country in terms of military and political aspects was very important. This was not just a simple matter of "benefiting his hometown." Therefore, at the invitation of Chairman Long, he boarded a plane again and flew back to Yunnan despite his serious illness. Chairman Long arranged for Mr. Li to stay at the Yuyuan Guesthouse in Kunming. Mr. Li, on the advice of his doctor, besides settling his family in Kunming, went to the hot springs in Ningzhou to recuperate. When there were important events that needed to be discussed with the authorities, he would drive back to Kunming for a few days.</p>
<p>Because I, the reporter, had met Mr. Li several times before, I heard two days ago that Mr. Li had returned from the hot springs to Kunming to spend the New Year, so I sent a card to visit him. Although Mr. Li was extremely busy, he still received me immediately. Although his physique was still holding a cane due to his illness, the color on his face was a bright red, and especially when I saw his two sparkling eyes, I could imagine that he had superior energy when he was young.</p>
<p>After Mr. Li and the reporter exchanged greetings, I explained my intention to visit him for the Shen Bao and expressed that if the life and thoughts of a respected elder like Mr. Li were recorded, it would surely be welcomed by Shen Bao readers at home and abroad. However, Mr. Li's attitude was very humble, and he repeatedly said, "I dare not, I dare not," and bowed repeatedly with both hands.</p>
<p>After several requests from the reporter, he made some remarks in a very solemn and sincere manner: "I have been away from Yunnan for fourteen or fifteen years. It was in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China that I went to Suzhou and never came to Yunnan again. This year, I only returned to my province to reside because of my illness. My hometown is Qushi in Tengchong, Yunnan. My family moved there from Jiangsu at the end of the Ming Dynasty. I grew up there, so I have a deep impression of that place. I lived in Suzhou for a long time, but I can never forget my nostalgia for my hometown. In my writings, I often like to use the words Qushi as a title, such as 'Qushi Series,' 'Qushi Prose,' 'Qushi Poetry,' etc. This is just to commemorate and miss my ancestors and my hometown, but in fact it is all unnecessary, and I will have to ask for your correction in the future..."</p>
<p>Mr. Li was always so polite. His poems are extremely good. I especially love the first two lines of his seven-character quatrain "Mourning My Elder Brother, Mr. Taiyan" in the "Qushi Poetry": "In life, we were both friends and teachers, For ten thousand ages, a feather in the clouds." There is also a line in his poem "Writing Love" written when he was about to leave Suzhou: "... The declining trend on the battlefield is difficult to reverse, and the dangerous situation is worrying. Unfortunately, it falls into the hands of the Japanese invaders, and the scriptures and property are at their disposal. Go to the three islands of ×××, strong men and scholars are killed together. How can this scene be described? The descendants of Yan and Huang are all like cattle and horses. Imperialism is originally like this, and if you cannot be self-reliant, what is the excuse,..."</p>
<p>In this poem, not only can it be seen that Mr. Li's use of words such as "imperialism" is extremely free and bold, but also in the style of the poem, he breaks away from the old customs and gallops in the realm of realism. At that time, because I talked with Mr. Li about his poetry, it aroused his interest, and he smiled and told me that he had a poem when he returned to Yunnan, so he chanted aloud: "The divine eagle flaps its wings out of Chang'an, Ten thousand miles of light clouds return in a day; May I ask what the guest brings back? A body of sickness and gray hair." I immediately copied it down with a pen and added it to the text of this interview record. Mr. Li's other works, such as "Jingyitang Poetry Collection" and "Preliminary Draft of Yunnan Inscriptions," are extremely valuable. Due to space limitations, I cannot introduce them in detail here. We will discuss them in detail when we have the opportunity in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Wartime Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Measures Amended and Approved by the Central Standing Committee and Promulgated <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing Air Dispatch] To meet wartime needs, the Central Government, in its 86th meeting of the Central Standing Committee in July of last year, passed the "Wartime Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Measures." In October of the same year, it established the Central and local Book and Magazine Review Committees to begin work. Since the commencement of manuscript review work, based on several months of practical experience, it was deeply felt that the previously promulgated "Wartime Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Measures" needed to be amended as appropriate. Regarding the measures, purely academic works, the content of which does not involve current affairs issues, politics, society, or ideology, may not require submission for review. The manuscript need not be typeset in advance, but must be submitted to the reviewing authority for review before publication and distribution. Regarding the scope, previously, publications of party, government, and military organs were exempt from manuscript review. However, many publications of these organs are theoretical in nature, and the authors are not all responsible personnel of the organs, making them not much different from general publications. Therefore, regarding such books and periodicals, with the exception of "official gazettes," manuscripts must also be submitted for review to ensure universality. Regarding procedures, previously, it was stipulated that those submitting manuscripts for review must submit three copies of the final proof. At a time when printing in the interior is extremely difficult, this was felt to be inconvenient. It would be better to submit handwritten manuscripts or proofs, and after review, the original manuscript or proof would be stamped with an "Reviewed" seal and returned to the submitter, for the sake of convenience. Based on the above requirements, the Central Government, at its 106th meeting of the Central Standing Committee on December 22nd of last year, proposed amendments to Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the measures. The full text of the amended version is recorded below.</p>
<p>Wartime Book Manuscript Review Measures</p>
<p>(Passed at the 86th Meeting of the 5th Central Standing Committee on July 21, 1938, Amended at the 106th Meeting of the 5th Central Standing Committee on December 22, 1938)</p>
<p>(1) During the War of Resistance, in order to meet wartime needs and unify national thought, the Central Government has specially organized the Central Book and Magazine Review Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Central Review Authority) to adopt manuscript review measures to handle all review matters concerning books and magazines.</p>
<p>(2) The Central Review Authority shall be jointly organized by the Propaganda Department, the Social Affairs Department, and the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission of the Central Executive Committee, as well as the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Education. It shall be the highest book and magazine review authority in the country. Its organizational outline shall be determined separately.</p>
<p>(3) If the Central Review Authority has different opinions regarding the review of books and magazines, the opinion of the representative of the Central Propaganda Department shall prevail.</p>
<p>(4) To facilitate the rapid publication of books and magazines in various localities, party, government, military, and police organs in major cities (or provincial capitals) may, under the guidance of the Central Review Authority, establish local Book and Magazine Review Committees (hereinafter referred to as local Review Authorities) to handle the review of books and magazines in their respective localities. If there are not many bookstores and publishing houses in the local area, they may not be established. The general rules for the organization of local Review Authorities shall be determined separately.</p>
<p>(5) When local Review Authorities review various books and magazines, if they discover significant errors, they shall stop publication.

<h3 id="e16">The Western Republican Government Relocates from Barcelona, Defending and Holding Firm in the Outskirts of the City, Britain and France Confer Repeatedly on the Spanish Situation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Perpignan, Southern France, 22nd] People in the Spanish Republican government have stated that the President of the country, Azaña, has left the city of Barcelona and will relocate with all government personnel to Valencia or Madrid, but the exact location is not yet known. The government military headquarters has, following the precedent set in Madrid during times of crisis, built defensive fortifications on the high ground near Barcelona and is hastily constructing defense lines in the suburbs. Furthermore, French expatriates arriving here from Barcelona say that refugees from the Nationalist-occupied area are flocking to the city, exacerbating the food shortage.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Juan-les-Pins, 22nd] According to news from here tonight, the diplomatic corps are all withdrawing from Barcelona, and the French embassy is also evacuating.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Perpignan, 22nd] Spanish government sources stated today that Barcelona will not surrender even if it has to fight to the last man. The area around the city is already equipped with 250 to 300 cannons of various calibers for defense. Other reports indicate that the Spanish government is preparing to move to Girona. The fortress of Peralada near Girona and 20 kilometers from the French border is strongly built and can be used for defense. It contains valuable artworks, jewelry, and a large amount of remaining cash reserves from the Bank of Spain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] Prime Minister Daladier met with Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon and discussed the international situation, especially the situation caused by the Nationalist advance towards the city of Barcelona. The meeting lasted thirty minutes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] According to unconfirmed reports received here from Gibraltar, five Italian ships, fully loaded with tanks, artillery, and ammunition, escorted by eleven Italian destroyers, arrived at Cadiz and immediately unloaded their cargo, which was transported away by train heading north.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 22nd] The rebel authorities claim that a large shipment of arms and ammunition has arrived for the government forces, including 22 tanks that arrived via the Ventolra, Cerbère, and Le Perthus borders on Friday night, and that local customs officers have been ordered to allow them passage.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd] In the past few days, Britain and France have exchanged views on the Spanish war several times. It is understood that France feels extremely tense because the final victory of the rebels would disrupt the plan for military equilibrium. France would not only have to defend the eastern and Alpine borders, but would also have to station troops on the Spanish border. The issue of German and Italian influence in Spain was also discussed, but Britain believes that Germany and Italy will not cause Franco to join the European arms race. France also fears that after the rebels win, Italy will demand that France withdraw its volunteers from Spain, make concessions on Gibraltar, Tunisia, and the Suez Canal, and announce its future policy towards Spain.</p>
<p>The Rebels Besiege Barcelona</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] According to a radio report from the Nationalist headquarters in Burgos, the Nationalist forces are continuing to advance towards Barcelona, the Republican government's location. The villages of Subirats and Geltrú, 22 miles southwest of Barcelona, have been captured by the Nationalist forces. The French village, 20 miles west of Barcelona, is an important agricultural area in Catalonia, and it has also fallen. As a result, the Penedès area is now under Nationalist control. The vanguard is concentrating on Barcelona from all directions. One Nationalist unit, after capturing Igualada, advanced to the village of Cabrera de Anoia and attacked southeast along the Noya River, capturing an important iron bridge. The government forces, caught by surprise and failing to destroy the iron bridge, retreated. According to reports from Barcelona, citizens in the city and nearby villages in the war zone have been ordered to hastily build fortifications. Barcelona was bombed eight times yesterday. Nationalist aircraft are paying particular attention to the highway connecting Spain to France.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lleida, 22nd] The Spanish rebels continued to advance today. It is said that their vanguard is only 15 miles from Barcelona in some places. A large rebel force of 150,000 men is approaching the Llobregat River, advancing from the coast to the northwest, with the entire line from Igualada to Noya reaching 25 miles. The rebels are also advancing along the highway to Ucraina and the Ponts-Solsona highway. Their objective is clearly to cut off Barcelona's traffic with France. It is said that the line is advancing an average of five miles per day. In the past 24 hours, rebel aircraft have again bombed Barcelona. However, the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are unknown. It is reported that the British ship "African Mariner" was sunk by rebel aircraft today. There was an aerial battle when the rebel aircraft attacked. There were 40 rebel aircraft and 20 government aircraft. The rebels apparently want to carry out an aerial blockade to stop supplies to the government, especially along the coastal highway to France. The British ship "Stanholm" of Valencia was also damaged in a rebel air raid this morning. It is reported that the rebel aircraft bombed Valencia this morning, dropping no fewer than 40 bombs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Barcelona, 23rd] From last Monday to last night, Nationalist aircraft bombed Barcelona a total of 19 times, killing 30 civilians and injuring 66. The bombers were all German and Italian-made aircraft. The government forces are now using fighter planes in combat due to the proximity of the front line to Barcelona. Each bombing raid involves as many as 50 aircraft from both sides in aerial combat. The British ship "African Mariner" was previously bombed, but it did not sink. Six sailors on board were killed. In addition, four British ships were damaged by bombing at the end of last week, namely the "York Moor" with a hole in its side, the "Female Hunter" with damage to its deck, the "Dovreby" with damaged hull, and the "Spaniel Bark Lyle" with damage to its deck.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Valencia, 23rd] Yesterday morning, Spanish Nationalist aircraft bombed Valencia, and the British merchant ship "Stanholm" was also damaged.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] Today, Italian Premier Mussolini (see right picture) addressed farmers, his main purpose being to ridicule Western democratic countries and the enemies of Fascism. It is said that the enemies of Fascism are extremely ignorant and not worth worrying about. Their remarks are all intended to slander and fabricate out of thin air. He also said, "The French rumor that the Pope advised France to take a firm stance is the result of pure fabrication. I deeply believe that this kind of rumor is extremely foolish. It is easy to talk about taking a firm stance. What would happen if an Italian came out tomorrow and told his countrymen that they must take an even firmer stance?" Mussolini said that the price of wheat this year will not be changed and hoped that the country will have a good harvest.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, New York, 23rd] Ten of the thirteen passengers and crew of the Imperial Airways "Clipper" have been rescued. The other two passengers (American) and one flight attendant (British) are missing. All those rescued are exhausted and weak, and some may not recover. The American destroyer Erie arrived at the scene of the incident yesterday with a doctor on board. The plane appears to have sunk shortly after landing, as those rescued were wearing life jackets.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, New York, 22nd] The Imperial Airways "Clipper" has sunk in the Atlantic Ocean. Efforts to search for it began this morning. The US Navy blimp K21, nine Army giant airplanes, and one Navy giant airplane are preparing to fly to the scene. In addition, nine coastal patrol ships and one gunboat are also participating. It is reported that the yachts "Boomerda Commodore," "Boomerda Queen," and the ship "Port Walderton" are all searching near the scene. The search area is 500 miles long. According to a report from a coastal patrol plane, there is no trace of the plane in the area around the scene. It is also reported from Miami that Imperial Airways had communicated with the "Clipper" by radiotelephone at 2:10 AM, but this has been denied by the company.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] The Sunday Star published an article calling for the United States to ban the export of scrap iron as a way to economically sanction world aggressors. According to the article, "Supplying America's hypothetical enemies with basic raw materials is an extremely inconsistent fact. Who knows if one day the weapons made from these materials will attack our coast and kill our people? We are calling for peace on the one hand, and openly selling scrap iron to countries eager for war on the other hand, which is morally questionable." According to statistics, the amount of scrap iron purchased by Japan and Germany has greatly increased.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] According to semi-official reports, the period for which Congress authorized President Roosevelt to restrict domestic silver prices will expire on June 30 this year. Roosevelt does not intend to ask Congress to reauthorize this power. He said that he felt that the restriction plan, although assisted by Treasury Department personnel, had failed to achieve its purpose. Currently, the domestic silver price is 64 cents per ounce, while the world silver price is 43 cents. Treasury Department personnel recently stated that although silver supporters are demanding higher silver prices, they do not expect silver prices to rise sharply. The Republican Party in the House of Representatives, led by Martin, is conducting a campaign against the silver price restriction plan. At the same time, Senator Townsend has also suggested amending the Silver Purchase Act in the Senate.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Rumor that Hitler Telegraphed Mussolini Urging Him to Maintain Peace for One Year Regarding Unified Management of Political and Economic Power, Soviet Union Believes Germany is Unable to Attack Ukraine <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shanghai, 24th Special Dispatch] According to United Press International, Rome, Hitler recently instructed his ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, to strongly urge Mussolini to maintain peace for one year. Mackensen was ordered to visit Ciano to listen to the details of Chamberlain and Mussolini's negotiations. Afterwards, he immediately telegraphed Hitler, and shortly thereafter, sent Hitler's personal letter to Mussolini. Rome believes that Mussolini provided Germany with assistance at the Munich Conference, and Hitler now feels that it is time to repay the favor.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shanghai, 23rd Special Dispatch] According to a telegram from Vladivostok relayed from Moscow, although the European situation has become tense again after the resignation of Schacht, the head of the German National Bank, Moscow still does not believe that there will be a war in Ukraine this spring, as Hitler's strength is still insufficient. Seeing that the Sino-Japanese War is prolonged indefinitely, Hitler feels that Japan is difficult to help, so he plans to choose the easier path and attack Southeastern Europe, mainly targeting Romania.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] According to German newspapers, after Schacht's departure, Germany has now decided to adopt an economic policy based on centralism. According to the finances and economy of a centralist political country, its management power cannot be separated. The "People's Observer" stated that the fact that Economic Minister Funk also serves as the president of the Deutsche Bank can allow Germany to achieve its economic goals more easily. Germany is currently lacking in labor force, so it must increase the effectiveness of various industries, and the merger of the financial and economic departments is necessary. The "Berlin Daily" denied that there were any changes in Germany's economic policy and said that the government would maintain the Deutsche Bank's domestic and foreign credit.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] US Senator Pittman, in a broadcast speech, supported the US government's military expansion plan. He said that the United States is in danger of being invaded by foreign countries. "Hitler's ambitions are never satisfied, and Japan's fixed policy is to dominate East Asia and the islands of the West Pacific." The Republican Party has organized an "Eleven-Member Committee" to review the military expansion plan. Senator Taft of the party told people that President Roosevelt's military expansion requests are not excessive. President Roosevelt's foreign policy, which he supports, is not only to defend the country, so the military strength he needs should be far more powerful than it is now.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Yugoslavia Capital, 22nd] After a day of banquets and social events, Foreign Minister Qi Yano took a special train back to his country in the evening.

<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 22nd] According to news from here tonight, Italian officials are extremely satisfied with the results of the meeting between Qi Yano and Stojadinović.

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e32">Traitors Run Around for ×, Promoting "Peace" <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>After the incident of Wang Zhao-ming ×××× was regarded as "past," the ××××'s "peace" conspiracy to divide unity and undermine the War of Resistance was ignored, which is a very significant crisis at present.</p>
<p>Wang Zhao-ming's communication with ××× to seek peace and surrender did not originate from a sudden event. The crushing and eradication of this communication with ××× to seek peace and surrender conspiracy cannot be achieved overnight with a single document or telegram. If this kind of conspiracy to seek peace and surrender is not thoroughly swept away one day, not only will the War of Resistance and nation-building not be completed one day, but even the national unity in the War of Resistance will not be able to continue.</p>
<p>The newspapers these days reported that the traitors in South China are being used by × to run around for "peace," advocating the construction of a "Southwest Anti-Communist Peace Government," sending claws and fangs to those who are estranged from the government and who are highly regarded, and ××××, tempting them with sweet words and generous rewards. This is one of the new ways of activity of the elements who collude with × to betray the country and seek peace and surrender. These elements are not only acting so stupidly overseas, but are still secretly plotting in the country. Although their insane activities are of no success, their influence on confusing people's minds and undermining unity on the future of the War of Resistance and nation-building cannot be tolerated for a moment!</p>
<p>On the one hand, we must awaken the general people of high prestige, improve self-confidence and self-esteem, improve the heart-wrenching alert of × people and traitors, not only passively not being tempted and utilized by × well, but also actively exposing the truth of × traitor conspiracy, ×× the group of righteous patriots in the society, ×××. On the other hand, we also hope that this Fifth Plenary Session will make a serious and more realistic decision on a way to thoroughly eradicate pro-Japanese traitors and activities that are not conducive to united resistance. Special attention should be paid to the fact that these elements will be deeply hidden under the guise of "anti-communism." We should use the national alliance force to consolidate unity across the country to give them a fatal counterattack.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Serious Situation in Spain <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Spanish War is a war in which the two fascist aggressive countries of Italy and Germany are endangering the democratic republic of Spain. At the same time, it is also a war in which these two aggressive countries are endangering the democratic powers of Europe, especially Britain and France. Unfortunately, the main countries were confused by the "anti-communist" smoke screen of the aggressors and restricted by the short-sighted psychology of selfishness and self-interest. They did not recognize this point. They dreamed that after the aggressors obtained certain satisfaction in Spain, they would no longer harass them. Therefore, as early as two and a half years ago, they adopted a so-called "non-intervention" policy for this war that actually infringed upon themselves, allowing Italian and German iron hooves and bombs to run rampant in Spain. Even this time, the League of Nations Administrative Council had to discuss the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteers who were helping the Spanish Republican Army! No wonder Italy is even more frantically planning an offensive, and now the fascist army is approaching Barcelona and the French border; no wonder it has aroused the indignant opposition of the Communist Party, the Labour Party, the Socialist Party and other progressive and righteous people in Britain and France, advocating for immediate and large-scale aid to the Spanish government, and former US Secretary of State Stimson also demanded yesterday morning that the ban on the shipment of munitions to Spain be lifted!</p>
<p>Now the situation in Spain has become very serious due to the more frantic offensives of Italy and Germany. We admire the spirit of the Spanish government and people who have bravely resisted for two and a half years to safeguard peace and democracy. We admire the determination of Spain and its international allied forces to vow to shed the last drop of blood to fight for freedom and peace, but we should not sit idly by and watch Spain's bitter struggle without lending a helping hand. Because the day when Italy and Germany ×× succeed in Spain will also be the time when Japan ×× is more rampant in the Far East—even if we cannot provide the Spanish government with any material assistance, we must mobilize public opinion, mobilize all spiritual forces, and mobilize the power of the united front of people from all countries in the world to urge Britain, France and the United States to resolutely abandon the "non-intervention" or "neutral" policy that only benefits the enemy, quickly impose effective sanctions on the aggressors, and provide the Spanish government with the convenience of obtaining greater external assistance! Because helping Spain is helping Britain, America, Russia themselves, and it is also helping world peace!</p>
<h3 id="e34">Romania Under the Gaze of the National Socialist Party <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Beard</p>
<p>Since Bismarck's eastward policy was incorporated into Hitler's "Mein Kampf" and revived, Romania has also become one of the targets of the National Socialist Party's aggression. Carol is a descendant of the German Hohenzollern family. His mistress, Mrs. Lupescu, is the richest woman in the country. Although she is of Jewish blood, she is the most outspoken advocate of anti-Semitism. Her political power is at least comparable to that of Mrs. Astor of England. Carol is surrounded by a group of corrupt soldiers, corrupt officials and idle politicians. In particular, the so-called officer corps is composed of the sons of feudal landlords, and the Fascist atmosphere is very strong. Therefore, Hitler's spies can infiltrate the central important agencies of Romania. Many political parties are under his command. More than 80 Romanian newspapers accept Goebbels' command. In 1936, the German Propaganda Ministry spent 60 million Romanian lei on propaganda in Romania. Newspapers with the 卍 symbol are openly published in almost every city. Like the German Emperor, Hitler first wanted (1) British neutrality (2) Italian sympathy (3) to make France incapable. He actually armed the Rhineland smoothly, built fortifications on the Siegfried Line, cut off France's route to aid its Eastern European allies, signed a so-called ten-year non-aggression treaty with Poland, cut off the channel for the Soviet Union to aid France, and used Italy's isolation during the Italo-Ethiopian War to form the German-Italian axis, using aid to Franco as an exchange condition for Italy's tacit consent to annex Austria. After the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact, he then used Czechoslovakia as a surgical target. Chamberlain's guarantee that Britain and Germany would not fight in the future seemed to mean that Hitler could walk alone in Southeastern Europe without having to worry about British intervention. However, Hitler's progress is not necessarily so optimistic. The result of Halifax's negotiations with him in Berlin last September was that Britain tacitly agreed to his annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia as an exchange condition for Germany's temporary suspension of colonial demands. These have now been gradually realized, but if he wants to attack again, Britain can no longer remain neutral. ×××××××× can no longer be moved to the Balkan Peninsula to let him break into the gateway to the Near East.</p>
<p>After the Munich Conference, France has been relegated to a secondary position in Europe. Although it does not dare to abandon the Franco-Soviet Pact and still wants to continue to struggle, the general trend has been lost after the partition of Czechoslovakia, and it has to follow Britain. As far as Central Europe, the Balkans and the Near East are concerned, Britain and France have the same interests. At least they are completely consistent in preventing Nazi forces from invading their sphere of influence, so even though Hitler has made France powerless, he cannot make Britain remain neutral forever. Moreover, he is not sure about winning Italian sympathy. Italy is willing for Germany to take back its overseas colonies, because Mussolini knows that the German navy is not enough to confront Britain. Once they get it, they will have to rely on the Italian navy for help. In this way, they can call Hitler to listen to him. Therefore, he tried his best to instigate the Germans to intensify their overseas development and did not want Germany to sit up in Europe and block his way to the Balkans and the Near East. Italy's markets in the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey and other countries have been almost completely encroached upon by Germany after the League of Nations passed economic sanctions against Italy. This year, without firing a shot, it annexed Austria and the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. Mussolini saw that his apprentice was so powerful that he was actually better than him, and his power was surprisingly above him, so he was restless and wanted to find a way to stop him. Recently, Hungary requested the recovery of Ruthenia in southern Czechoslovakia and to connect with Poland, which Italy strongly approved of. The purpose was to form a barrier to prevent German eastward invasion by the joint line of Poland and Hungary. Hitler also understood very well, and he had already planned in his mind that Ruthenia is a Ukrainian national area, and there are many Ukrainians in Poland and the Soviet Union. He wanted to use it as a base to prepare for aggression against the Soviet Union and Poland. Mussolini was afraid that Hitler would dismantle the stage in Spain, so he did not dare to insist. However, we should be aware that the British-Italian agreement was motivated by Germany's annexation of Austria, and it was completed at the time of the partition of Czechoslovakia. Mussolini will never be a wedding dress for Hitler forever.</p>
<p>Secondly, we talk about Hungary. Hungary lost a lot of land after the war and has always been opposed to the Little Entente. It has no good feelings for Romania in particular because of the loss of land. It originally wanted to rely on Germany's strength to confront each other, but since Austria's death, it has been directly adjacent to Germany and feels threatened. Hitler had long wanted to make Hungary available to him, so he promised to help him recover the lost land in Czechoslovakia. However, Hitler temporarily changed his mind, and the request to recover Ruthenia and connect with Poland was rejected by Hitler. Moreover, Ruthenia has become Germany's base for the Greater Ukrainian Independence Movement. Hungary is certainly disappointed. When Germany invades Romania in the future, will Hitler reissue blank checks and allow it to pass through? It depends on whether the relationship between the Balkan countries and Hungary can be improved and how vigilant the Magyar nation is.</p>
<p>Poland is Romania's northern neighbor. It was originally very close to Germany. Recently, seeing Czechoslovakia's fate, it feels that it is already surrounded on three sides by German forces, and the so-called Greater Ukrainian National Independence Movement is fundamentally aimed at it. Especially the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor are in imminent danger. So it hurriedly signed a new Polish-Soviet treaty and made peace with Lithuania. Foreign Minister Beck's masterpiece was warmly praised by the people. In the recent parliamentary election, Professor Macosky, the leader of the National Unity Front, was elected Speaker of the House, and Colonel Miedziński was elected Speaker of the Senate. Poland is already turning to an anti-German path. The Soviet Union is Romania's western neighbor. In the anti-fascist struggle, it is the main force in the world. If Romania has the determination to defend itself, it must first eradicate the Nazi running dogs in the country. Of course, the Soviet Union is happy to help. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The harm of red pill poison far exceeds that of opium. In the past four or five years, it has become increasingly severe, and the poison has spread throughout various districts of Hong Kong. Even after the authorities severely investigated and cracked down on it, the flames of poison have not only failed to extinguish, but have intensified. The current Acting Chinese Affairs Secretary has always hated this poison. Recently, as there is an Anti-Drug Promotion Association in Hong Kong, and it is the only anti-drug group, he specially summoned the President of the Association, Liu Jingqing, yesterday morning to consult on the association's recent progress and plans to promote anti-drug efforts. President Liu and Secretary-General Pan Youcheng went to present the details of their observations. Their opinions can be summarized into two points: (1) Winning hearts is the best strategy, using various propaganda to make everyone understand the harm of red pill poison. (2) Practical treatment, establishing a red pill treatment center to enable patients to stay in the center for treatment. Secretary Ka listened and was very satisfied, and immediately introduced Mr. Liu to Health Secretary Situ Yongjue. Secretary Situ also expressed great sympathy and requested to study treatment methods with Professor Shu Lu, the honorary president of the association. If the research results still conclude that a treatment center is indispensable, then I will do my best to support it, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e46">In the Refugee Camp <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>More than 900 isolated soldiers who retreated from Shatoujiao into British territory and were guarded are living a lonely life in the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp. For a month, there has been no unexpected change. However, since the incident of "shooting a deserter", unfortunate events have followed one after another. People from all walks of life have shown great sympathy for their misfortune; the authorities are also paying close attention to this matter and are making every effort to improve their lives and eliminate the occurrence of various misfortunes. Yesterday, the reporter got a good opportunity to run into the heavily guarded refugee camp to visit these refugee soldiers. Coincidentally, the refugee service team sent by the Youth Association also arrived at this time, adding a lot of excitement. Here, I roughly recorded the impressions I got in the past month.</p>
<p>It was noon, and the friendly sun was warmly caressing their bodies. After getting off the bus, I ran along the yellow mud road that passes through the refugee camp. I walked busily, and my forehead was slightly sweating, but when I arrived at the refugee camp and saw the heavily guarded scene, I seemed to have lost the sun's heat. What was beating in my heart was only "coldness"! The refugee soldiers were all wearing gray cotton-padded jackets, huddled under the sun. On their malnourished and dark faces, there was an even more desolate look of haggardness. In order to provide them with proper recreation, Room No. 2 was set up as a club. At this time, many people were surrounding the long table, looking at the books and magazines sent by others. Another group was surrounding the phonograph. The walls were covered with cautionary signs sent by the Youth Military Service Corps and other wall newspapers, and the surroundings were filled with a new atmosphere!</p>
<p>Not long after, several comrades from the Youth Association's Military Service Corps arrived. The refugee soldiers, who had gotten out of bed, were walking around, and reading books, gathered around as if they had heard the news. The windows on all sides were filled with heads, surrounding these dozens of members. "Newspapers! Newspapers!" a burst of clamorous voices, followed by everyone reaching out to grab them. "Don't move, the administrator will distribute them to you later," a young man in the service team shouted like this. Everyone listened and stood by with their hands down.</p>
<p>After distributing the letters from relatives and friends outside, they began to give current affairs reports: "The war in the Northwest... × people are trying to cut off our international route, but this is just a dream... Now the × people there have been heavily surrounded." The young man kept saying, "Now let's talk about the war on the Guangdong side!"——Guangdong! Guangdong! caused a small commotion. "On the northern front, on the night of the 15th, more than 1,000 × soldiers from near Zhongluotan and Hehe were thinking of invading north. Our ambushing artillery took advantage of their unpreparedness and launched artillery fire. Our heroic soldiers also rushed over, with cannons and grenades flying together, killing them without leaving a single piece of armor." At this time, they were listening with their ears and thinking with their hearts, thinking of their activity on the battlefield, thinking of the pleasure of killing ×, some were stunned, and some were slapping their thighs and shouting. The young man paused and continued: "Now our 100,000 troops have advanced in separate ways and are making a large-scale encirclement of Guangzhou. I believe that in the near future, we will be able to completely drive these remaining × out of Guangdong." A burst of warm applause sent the breathless young man off the stage!</p>
<p>Then they played the phonograph they brought. The first record was called Defend Greater Guangdong, which was sung in Cantonese, "Compatriots, 30 million people, must defend Greater Guangdong..." The magnificent singing voice penetrated their hearts, and they were very excited. Then they sang Defend China "You haven't recognized the lyrics yet! Let me tell you about it," the young man said as he stood up. "The first sentence is to defend China, defend China, swear to defend democratic China, which means that in this critical autumn of national survival, who doesn't want to defend our Republic of China except for the Han traitors, but are we defending it with our mouths? No! We must take out all our strength and put life and death aside to defend China," the last sentence is to look at the Northeast rivers and mountains, the blue sky and white sun all over the ground still flying, listen to 400 million people singing, freedom, equality, liberation, which means that when we win the final victory, the national flag with the blue sky and white sun all over the ground will still be flying in the Northeast, and at that time the children of the 400 million Chinese people will sing in unison, what will they sing? It's not singing "for a beautiful woman" but singing freedom! Equality! Liberation!" A burst of cheerful laughter ended the explanation of the lyrics.</p>
<p>As the magnificent singing voice was played, everyone's heart was already surging. After the record was finished, the young man jumped onto the stage and asked loudly: "Are you willing to defend China?" The crowd immediately followed and said: "We are willing!" "Then, you must strictly abide by discipline and not act rashly. Wait for another opportunity to show your skills!" The young man said loudly, raising his hands, and the crowd also shouted "Okay!" in unison.</p>
<p>Then the young man rubbed his hands and jumped onto the stage again to teach them to sing: "Mobilize..." They could sing it without being taught. The young man said: "You still have a lot of strength!" Everyone laughed. The second one was to fight ×××... They sang it fluently without much guidance. The young man lightly said: "You all sing very well, but you have to use force when you sing 'fight', '××××××××××××'." Everyone couldn't help but laugh when they heard it.</p>
<p>After the singing was over, they summoned the representatives from each room to talk about the matter of each person fleeing privately. Everyone had some opinions. After hearing this, everyone expressed their opinions in a very innocent way according to the number of the room. A representative leaned closer and said: "We are about to have dinner. You go and see the situation over there. We know very clearly from the doctor that the government provides us with a certain amount of food, which is 3 taels of green vegetables, 2 taels of salted fish, and 11 taels of white rice per person per meal. 1 tael of meat, but now it is difficult to find this amount when calculating two meals together! However, the amount of rice will exceed 11 taels, because the rice is mixed with a lot of chaff! We have negotiated with the cooks. Guess what they said? They said, "If you can't swallow it, it's best not to eat it!"</p>
<p>Also, now it's winter, and the rich people are wearing heavy fur coats and don't know what cold is like. We were lucky enough to get two sheets, and those who were unlucky only got one. Huddling in the cold wind, who knows the desolate taste...". The representative continued in one breath, his face flushed with exertion.</p>
<p>Everyone was deeply moved after hearing these words and remained silent. They only tried their best to comfort them to be patient and not to act rashly, and to wait for the final victory to come, at which time they could be reborn. Everyone cheered and dispersed after listening!</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the person in charge can pay close attention to their treatment and try to improve it as much as possible so that unfortunate events can be eliminated!</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Complete Picture of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Dongjiang River [1] <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Zhang</p>
<p>The Fifth Travelogue Returning to Hui</p>
<p>1. On the way to departure</p>
<p>[Special Travel Correspondent of This Newspaper] After the "October 12th" Incident, the × people used all their strength to land from Daya Bay and attack Guangzhou, causing Nanhua to fall into the hands of demons. We observe the overall war situation. Huizhou is the starting point for the × army to use strategies, and it is certainly important in the war situation; while Boluo County is the hub of military transportation between Huizhou and Guangzhou. When the × army advanced towards Zengcheng, it used Boluo to encircle and raid in two routes. Even the military transportation in South China in the future completely used the Guanghui Highway that runs through Boluo as a transportation channel. In general military terms, it is a place with extremely high military value. Moreover, the × army's retreat is still occupying two strongholds, Zengcheng and Shilong, lingering in the Litchi Garden in the Boluo-Zengcheng border area and the Dongbo area in the Boluo-Dongguan border area. It is obvious that Boluo is now standing on the front line of the eastern front and is still in a state of war. In order to commemorate those ashes that were destroyed by the magic hands of the × people, and to admire our soldiers who are standing on the front line, it seems that we should go to Boluo for a broad visit on the eve of this major counter-offensive to fulfill the duties of our reporter.</p>
<p>Luo Fengxiang (left), Commander of the Dongjiang Detachment, and Liang Zhu (right), Deputy Commander</p>
<p>Because of this motive, although it is clear that the city that has just been recovered. The order and war are not stable, and there are considerable dangers and difficulties, but we cannot take everything into account. Therefore, two departure routes were decided: first, go down the Dongjiang River, focusing on the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River; then, go along the Huiguang Highway, focusing on the Boluo-Zengcheng border area, that is, the front line of our army. On the morning of December 30, the reporter hired a speedboat and went down the river, starting a brave journey. At the same time, in order to prevent rampant bandits along the way, I also invited several members of the self-defense group to act as temporary bodyguards for the reporter.</p>
<p>The weather that day was neither rainy nor windy, and it was very gloomy. However, thick gray clouds were pieced together in the sky, as if the earth was brewing rain. Because there was no wind, the boat was moving very slowly, and the reporter was able to fully mourn the remains on both sides of the river in this slow and rhythmic rowing sound. I remember that when the 151st Division retreated from Huizhou on October 14, although they were all designated to gather in Boluo, one part crossed the river from the North Gate and went along the highway through Shuibei Station. The other part went straight down the river to Jiantan and crossed the river. Therefore, scattered military uniforms and utensils can still be seen on the Jiang'an section from Huizhou City to Jiantan. This proves that the retreat at that time was scattered and unplanned. It also proves the incompetence of the division commander, which led to this painful failure. However, "failure is the mother of success", and we always hope to build new strength from painful lessons. According to the boatman, a few days ago, there were still several corpses eroded by wind and rain scattered on the river bank, which were being collected by the villagers in the nearby villages. I don't know if they were soldiers or civilians. Really, × people's cruel blood debt is left everywhere and all the time. When can we wash it away?</p>
<p>It is only more than ten miles of water from Huizhou City to Jiantan. It was noon when we arrived at Jiantan. Suddenly, three × planes flew overhead from south to north, flying very low in the dog sky. The rattling sound of the plane suddenly shattered the silence of our journey. Fearing that it was for clear reconnaissance, it suddenly lowered and circled over the boat before turning away. In the moment when our small boat was circling, although the situation was a bit like a chick under a hungry eagle, the self-defense group in the boat had raised their guns and hid in the shed, preparing to fight back when the × plane fell low and strafed. Regardless of the size of the force, fighting for a price is our due determination.</p>
<p>Jiantan is originally a dangerous point in the Huibo waterway. The two mountains stand opposite each other, the pool is very deep, and constantly floating and rolling whirlpools are churning. During the Eastern Expedition of the Dian-Gui Army, it was once a battlefield. Yang Kunru, the Cantonese army commander guarding Huizhou City, was miserably defeated here. Thinking carefully about the ghosts on that battlefield, I couldn't help but resent them for not staying to die in today's national resistance war. They wasted the value of their lives too much. However, this time our garrison did not set up defenses and allowed the × army to cross the river swaggeringly. It was a bit lonely. Now, there is nothing on the swirling river surface, only more than ten ships that were burned by the × people, broken masts and broken oars, reflected on the green river, stimulating the traveler.</p>
<p>We did not stay in Boluo for long, because we wanted to reach Sucun before sunset. Tan Gongye, more than ten miles from Boluo City, is as dangerous as Jiantan. There is a Tan Gong Temple on the mountain by the shore. According to folklore, boats must burn incense and pray silently when passing by here, otherwise it will be unlucky. The "Bodhisattva" will also collect "water money". This area has always been a haunt for bandits, and we were also wary. Everyone held their guns and stared vigilantly. Fortunately, we were safe and sound. We couldn't help but admire the power of the gun in our hearts. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e48">To the People Who Are Going to Kunming <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Luo</p>
<p>Friends: Do you feel the air is dull? Do you feel mentally exhausted? Do you feel the cost of living is too high? Have you ever felt that you can't read books? Then, prepare your luggage immediately, leave this dull Hong Kong Island, return to our homeland, paradise, and go to Kunming. Let me introduce everything here to you as far as I know.</p>
<p>The weather in Kunming is the clearest! Under the clear blue sky, it is full of golden sunlight all day long. Living in such fresh air and warm sunlight always makes people happy. In terms of climate change, the four seasons are the same. It is green everywhere, and it is peaceful every day. There are two lines of poetry: "The four seasons are spring and summer, and one rain turns into winter." It is the most appropriate portrayal. The rainy season is in late summer and early autumn, and it rarely rains on other days.</p>
<p>The scenery of Kunming: There is a quiet West Mountain here. I once lived the life of a hermit in their monastery for a week. I climbed to the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise in the early morning and listened to the bell of the temple in the evening. It really made me feel infinite nostalgia! There is also Ming Lake, which is as blue as a gem. Boating on the moonlit night is the most poetic. There are many other famous mountains and scenic spots, which make people feel like they are in Peiping, and it is known as Little Peiping. However, foreign foreigners will praise in unison: Little Switzerland in the frozen East.</p>
<p>Cost of living: Kunming is, after all, a small inland city, and the cost of living was originally very low. However, after the Anti-Japanese War, the number of people who escaped from the coastal cities to this place increased day by day, so this small mountain city suddenly became prosperous. Department stores, cinemas, and large hotels sprang up one after another, and the old Kunming city was also modernized. However, the cost of living is also rising day by day - in the past, old flag tickets were used as a unit of buying and selling! Now it takes at least the central currency. As for the exact amount of the cost of living! It is difficult to have a standard, depending on the economic situation of each person. Let's take ordinary students as an example: food costs seven or eight yuan per month, as for pocket money, entertainment expenses, book purchase expenses, etc., those who are more economically well-off can naturally buy a little more. If I have to say a total amount, I can generally say that, excluding food expenses, ten dollars a month is enough.</p>
<p>Things to prepare when coming: In Kunming, foreign goods are quite expensive, not cheaper than domestic goods. Don't bring too many kinds of foreign goods when you come. If they are discovered by the maritime customs, they will be taken away. I think it is best to buy less. This point should be noted first. The atmosphere in Kunming is quite low in temperature in winter and usually in the morning and evening, so you should bring a quilt. There are mosquitoes in summer, so don't forget to bring a mosquito net. Because there are many foreign female students here, their clothing and accessories are almost the same as in Guangzhou. In winter, they wear coats, and in summer, they wear short-sleeved cheongsams, high heels, and curled hair. In short, bring whatever you wear in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>You must think that Kunming is very desolate and old, right? But after you come, you will be surprised, because the streets are full of the latest and brightest cars; everywhere you look, you see young and beautiful gentlemen and fragrant and modern ladies; what you touch is the music of radio broadcasts. In the sound cinema, when the movie starts, there will be a burst of local dialect interpretation, just like in the silent film era in Guangzhou. This is the characteristic of Kunming City. Rescue work is done as usual, but unfortunately, it is mostly official and not noticed by people. It's really a bit painful.</p>
<p>Here, in addition to Yunnan University, the Southwest Associated University, the Central Research Institute, the Chung Cheng Medical College, and the National College of Technology have moved here. Now Zhongda has also moved here. Kunming is about to become a new cultural center, adding a lot of popularity. As for the newly added drawing paper publications, there are many more, such as the famous Tianjin Yishi Daily. It costs about 50 Hong Kong dollars to go from Hong Kong to Kunming, Yunnan via Annam. If you come with a group, it will be more economical. That's all I can tell you for now.</p>
<p>Students staying in Hong Kong and Macau, do not live in this colony. This is really your paradise, really for you to develop. On the one hand, open your books, and on the other hand, do some rescue work. Come on, come to Kunming, and we'll talk more when we have the chance. Sincerely, Xia Luo</p>

<h3 id="e49">Crossing the Abdomen of Fujian: From Nanping to Yong'an <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Nanping's position is strategically located at the center of Fujian Province. The Jianxi, Futunxi, and Shaxi rivers converge here and flow south to form the Min River. Therefore, due to its advantageous geographical location, Nanping has become the main transportation hub in northern Fujian. Since the expansion and construction of highways in southwestern Fujian, Shaxian and Yong'an can lead to Yancheng, Changting, and Longyan in the west, reaching the border between Fujian and Guangdong. Another route can reach Datian, Yihua, and Yongchun in the south, directly approaching the coastal areas. Therefore, Nanping is currently a key point for transportation between southwestern and central Fujian. The Fujian Provincial Government moved its administration to Yong'an in western Fujian in May of last year, establishing a new provincial capital. Subsequently, the political and cultural center of the province shifted westward, making Nanping even more important today. Two years ago, the reporter lived in Nanping for some time. Now, upon revisiting, I truly feel that it has undergone a complete transformation. The second day after New Year's Day was marked by continuous rain and cold weather, comparable to that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>The slow train heading west from Nanping Station departs at 7:30 AM. After the train leaves Nanping, it runs along the Shaxi River. With mountains on the left and water on the right, the scenery along the way is indeed pleasant. Unfortunately, the train travels bumpily. After less than two hours, the head starts to feel dizzy, and the mood to enjoy the scenery is completely shattered.</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the Min River have sluggish water flow, with numerous shoals and rocks occupying most of the riverbed. Occasionally, a solitary sail can be seen, ultimately giving the impression that this river is not suitable for navigation. The interior of Fujian is rich in abundant resources. Once developed, the geographical advantages will be immense. However, the development of transportation is a prerequisite. Although the expansion of inland highways in Fujian Province has achieved considerable results, work on surveying and mapping waterways is still needed. The War of Resistance has made us aware of many things that we previously overlooked. After this war, I believe that the development of all localities will undoubtedly accelerate and become an important foundation for national construction and prosperity.</p>
<p>Three hours after leaving Nanping, the train arrives at Shaxian, with a stop of more than half an hour. The station and the county seat are separated by a stream, with boats shuttling back and forth. Shaxian is currently an important place in Fujian Province. In another article, the reporter once compared it to "Whampoa before the Northern Expedition and Lushan before the War of Resistance," because various training programs to mobilize resistance forces in Fujian Province are held here. Tens of thousands of strong men and women receive new combat education here and then spread throughout Fujian Province, shouldering the arduous task of mobilizing the people. Gazing at the opposite shore, I cannot help but feel infinite respect for that city wall that embraces new life and nurtures the land.</p>
<p>The station is crowded and noisy, with most of the people being civil servants and soldiers. At the head and tail of the station, there are large oil paintings depicting scenes of beacon fires, angry faces, and sturdy, sharp bayonets and broadswords, fully highlighting the tense atmosphere of this place.</p>
<p>After the passengers finish lunch, the train continues westward. From here, the mountains overlap, and the highway is mostly carved along the mountainsides. The road surface is relatively narrow and uneven. The train travels more bumpily than the previous section. Climbing over the mountains, it twists and turns, making people feel anxious and afraid to look down. According to people on the train, this section of the highway used to be much worse and is currently being actively improved. Sure enough, we encountered many laborers along the way, in groups, repairing roads, chiseling mountains, and filling earth, all sweating profusely. As the train passed, they put down their hammers and hoes, or stopped their feet carrying mud, and watched attentively. I remember reading an article somewhere that said: "During this War of Resistance, the soldiers at the front resisting the enemy's artillery with their flesh and blood are admirable, but the hard-working compatriots in the rear who are sweating to maintain transportation and delivery are also worthy of our gratitude." As the car window swept past their honest and simple faces, respect arose in my heart.</p>
<p>Along the highway, we saw many碉堡 (碉堡, I'm not certain of what this means, but it's being translated as "碉堡" for now), which were built in the past to prevent bandits. To the west of the Shaxi River, we also saw two city walls, presumably the former county seat that has been abandoned. These fortresses are specifically designed to defend against bandits from within. In today's War of Resistance against Japan, I believe that their usefulness has been completely lost. Not only have they lost their usefulness, but I am afraid they may even provide resources for the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing) and cause infinite harm. This is because these city walls and fortresses cannot withstand the attacks of the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing)'s modern weapons in terms of defense. Once occupied by the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing), they can be used to defend against our Jinan battles. Looking at the vast Jinan area today, how many cities, once occupied by the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing), are difficult to recover? It can be seen that the fortress is harmful rather than beneficial today and must be demolished immediately.</p>
<p>After the car passes ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing) Town and travels for a while, we suddenly see a bright national flag flying high in the sky. As we approached, a flat square appeared before our eyes. The loud commands of "Attention!" and "At ease!" burst out from there. A team of armed soldiers was practicing martial arts to kill the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing) on the square. At the exit of the square, facing the highway, stands a stone archway with a blue background, and the horizontal inscription reads four large white characters, 'Awaiting Orders to Advance.' This solemn and tragic scene stimulated all the passengers in the car, and everyone stopped talking and joking, paying silent respect to the armed compatriots in the square and the national flag flying in the sky.</p>
<p>This can be said to be the new atmosphere of the Yansha Yong Road. When the reporter passed this road two years ago, it was just a scene of desolation and sadness. Now, not only are the villages gradually becoming cleaner, but the barren fields along the way are also covered with green wheat seedlings. It can be seen that the Fujian Province's promotion of winter cultivation to increase production has yielded results, and the people, after receiving considerable education, also show signs of a new transformation.</p>
<p>Although traveling on the Yansha waterway is difficult, the things seen during this journey from east to west across the abdomen of Fujian Province have brought great joy to the reporter.</p>
<p>The train arrives at Yong'an Station at 3:30 PM, allowing us to see the new atmosphere of this small mountain town, the new capital of Fujian!</p>
<h3 id="e50">—Shipping Special— <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Taishan ship arrived in Hong Kong from Macau yesterday morning. According to the captain of the ship, when passing through the sea area at 22°13'30" North latitude and 113°40'30" East longitude, many floating obstacles were found. Ships sailing through that area should pay attention to navigation.</p>
<p>The Blue Funnel Line ship, the Xian Fu Ya, represented by Butterfield &amp; Swire, came to Hong Kong some time ago to be repaired at the Taikoo Dockyard. The repairs were completed yesterday, and a test voyage was conducted in Hong Kong harbor in the afternoon. The results were satisfactory, and the ship will depart tomorrow for Singapore and Fremantle.</p>
<p>A Hungarian ship, named the Bissi Paz, arrived yesterday. According to investigations, the ship came from Keelung and entered the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs. No cargo was transported. The local agent is the Jielianbu Company.</p>

<p>— Pan Taifeng</p>
<p>Traveling eighty-four kilometers east from Binyang, one arrives at Gui, located on the left bank of the Yu River. Cars on the highway, whether from Wuzhou, Guangzhou Bay, or Liuzhou, all stay overnight here, so it has become lively after the war. There are many mountains in the county, among which the reserves of tungsten are 35 million tons. Agricultural products include lotus root and lotus root powder. Ten li away, there is Nanshan. Twenty-four li away, in Guanyan Cave, there are scenic spots such as stone Guanyan, stone elephants, stone carp, Dan stove, and flying bell. At the summit, there are Yixian Cave, Baiyun Residence, and Zhenyi Rock. At the foot of the mountain is Nanshan Temple. Legend has it that Emperor Jianwen of the Ming Dynasty once lived in seclusion here. The trees are shaded, and the environment is quiet and pleasant. It is now used as Zhongshan Park, where the Wanwang Pavilion is built to commemorate Shi Dakai, the Yi King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Longyan is fifty li to the east. The surface of the rock is wide and can accommodate thousands of people. There is a stone dragon on it, dozens of feet long, lifelike. Stalactites form figures, flowers, and birds, all lifelike. Donghu Lake in the east of the city has a mirror-like surface. Su Shi once visited here.</p>
<p>Three, the Liuyi Line, from Liuzhou to Yongning, is 280 kilometers long and consists of sandy and gravel roads. The 168 kilometers from Liuzhou to Binyang are combined with the Yuweng Line. From Binyang, it travels southwest, crossing the Fangshan Mountain to Yongning, a distance of 112 kilometers, passing through Luxu, Tanxu, Taishou, Enlong, Maling, Batang, Dalu, Wutang, Sitang, Ertang, and Shizhan. The section from Binyang to Wutang was opened in the tenth year of the Republic of China with complete specifications. In the fourteenth year, it continued to extend south. In June of the sixteenth year, construction was completed and traffic was opened. There are currently 122 bridges and many permanent bridges. There are 663 culverts. The maximum slope is 12%.</p>
<p>Four, the Liuli Line, from Liuzhou northwest to Liuzhai, at the junction of Guizhou and Guangxi, is 329 kilometers long. The 59 kilometers from Liuzhou to Datang are combined with the Yangyu and Liuyu lines. From Datang, it passes through Ouji, Liji, Qingyuan, Yishan, Yuanzhou, Taiping, Desheng, Sanjiangkou, Jiadao, Liuxu, Hechi, Fengmu, Babu, Chehe, Daxu, Nandan, Xindian, Mangchang, and Baping nineteen stations to Liuzhai. The road surface is paved with sand and gravel. There are 59 permanent bridges, 105 semi-permanent bridges, 845 permanent culverts, and 23 semi-permanent culverts. The maximum slope is 14%. The minimum radius of the curve is 18 meters. The Hechi Liuzhai section was first surveyed in the eighth year of the Republic of China. Construction was started in the twenty-first year after several interruptions and completed in the twenty-second year. It was extensively repaired again in the twenty-fourth year, so the project is still solid. However, the road surface is opened along the mountain, and rain and mudslides often cause damage.</p>
<p>This line is now managed by the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration and is included in the national highway network. Passing through Liuzhai and entering Guizhou Province, it is 303 kilometers to Guizhou. Accommodation and dining facilities on this line are contracted by the China Travel Service, so passenger transportation is handled most satisfactorily. As for freight transportation, due to the fall of the southeast, it has suddenly become busy. Although there are public and private vehicles going there, the goods are still piled up like mountains and difficult to clear. It can be said to be a unique feature in the history of highway transportation in our country.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Wuxi Industry Today <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Caihua</p>
<p>Large Factories Prefer to Rely on Others, Small Silk Factories Can Be Self-Reliant (Continued)</p>
<p>【Note】Supervisors are all Japanese, and the actual administrators are nominal. There are a total of 2,554 silk reeling machines.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the silk industry, it is worth mentioning that some silk factory employees are very principled and creative. On the one hand, they are unwilling to seek employment in the China Central Company, and on the other hand, for the sake of their family's livelihood, they cannot tighten their belts. Under these circumstances, a large number of small family-run silk factories have emerged. These small silk factories have a maximum of eight to twelve machines, and some have only four machines. The most have twenty machines. All silk machines and machinery were purchased from destroyed factories at extremely low prices of twenty to thirty yuan per machine. The so-called factory buildings are in the homes, and the silk machines and machinery are installed simply. They work day and night, and the output is considerable, and they can also obtain considerable profits. "Self-reliance" is truly admirable!</p>
<p>(4) Rice Industry</p>
<p>The next is the rice industry. Originally, there were many rice shops in the area outside the North Gate. Because of the heavy losses suffered in this war, there are now about 70 or more that have resumed business or been newly established. The scope of business is not as good as before the war. Now, it is limited to doing small business in the city and cannot even talk about exporting. Even if it is possible to export, it must be done in cooperation with the Japanese. Not only are the donation and tax procedures troublesome, but it is also very dangerous.</p>
<p>In short, Wuxi's current industry is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. It is a dark mess, with the clutches of exploitation reaching everywhere. Rather than eking out a living under the heavy oppression of the Japanese, it is better to move the factory inland and engage in production needed for the War of Resistance. This will not only allow the unemployed to return to the factory and participate in production, but also develop inland industries, which will benefit the country and the nation.</p>

<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] After the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Soccer Game was scheduled for February 19 (Lunar New Year), the General Association has been actively preparing. The Hong Kong team representatives will also be selected soon. The selection committee is confident about this, and Li Huitang's position as coach has also been internally determined.</p>
<p>Huitang told reporters yesterday that the General Association should select the Hong Kong team representatives as soon as possible, and then choose a date to hold a practice match so that all players can have a tacit understanding of cooperation before the big battle.</p>
<p>It is also reported that more than half of the Philippine team representatives are university students and are also skilled in basketball. If time permits, they may arrange several performances with strong teams upon arrival in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to Shanghai newspapers, the International Relief Committee has invited Li Huitang to come north to participate in charity soccer matches. It has been decided to hold two matches during the Lunar New Year, generally between the Chinese League and the Western League, and between the Eastern China and Lido. The dates are February 20 and 21, and the venues are all the Albers Road Yiyuan Stadium. (Note: Huitang has now decided to represent the Hong Kong team in the inter-city game, so the trip to Shanghai must be rescheduled.)</p>
<p>Shanghai public opinion unanimously approves of Huitang's agreement to go north to plead for refugees and hopes that Hong Kong can send more famous generals to join the Chinese League. (Donglang)</p>

These consecutive victories established a foundation for long-term success, truly deserving their reputation. Their football skills are undoubtedly superior, unlike those who violate sportsmanship. Western newspapers have commented extensively on this, and there is a reason for it. Last night, the 11th, the team clashed with the Police team at the Saigon Stone Stadium, their third battle since arriving in Vietnam. What attracted the most attention was that the Police team was a strong force here, undefeated in 1938 and had firmly grasped this year's Southern Vietnamese championship. They practiced day and night, possessing unique advantages, so many football fans worried about the South China team, and many bet on their victory or defeat. That night, the audience's pulse was tense, and their enthusiasm was boiling, no less than the athletes in the competition. Fortunately, the South China team players were highly skilled and calm in the face of battle, and were able to handle it with ease and win. Overall, this performance was the most exciting of all the previous matches, and the audience was also the largest that night, truly a unprecedented scene. The details of the battle are recorded below:</p>
<p>The weather was slightly cool that night, refreshing the mind. The lights were just turned on, and pedestrians and vehicles were flowing in the streets. In the Stone Stadium, the electric lights illuminated the area like daylight. On the green turf, barefoot immortals were active, busy practicing. Those who have seen the sea find it difficult to be impressed by other waters. One only feels that the ants are attached, like children playing hide-and-seek, chasing back and forth, falling east and west. The enthusiasm was present, and the human wall around the stadium was already impenetrable. Before long, at nine o'clock, the athletes of the South China and Police teams appeared on the field amidst thunderous applause. Each was full of energy and high morale. As the referee blew the silver whistle, the charge began. South China immediately adopted an offensive posture. The five forwards formed a united force, rushing towards the Police team from the shouts. A central breakthrough, and the defense was unable to retreat in time. In the blink of an eye, the goalkeeper, at a loss, was taken by surprise, and Chen Dehui hit the target with one arrow, and the whole stadium cheered. It was only three minutes after the start of the game. The Police team, stung by the blow, were unwilling to give in. Under the command of Commander Zheng, the three armies immediately launched a fierce counterattack against South China. Both wings expanded and advanced simultaneously. Liu Qingcai's central line was actually crossed. Li Tiansheng tried hard to defend the city, but the Police team's strategy was cunning and strange, maneuvering while launching sneak attacks. Li Tiansheng's iron wall was restrained, unable to use its strength. Mai Shaohan could not rush to the rescue in time. With a bang, goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai actually let the ball slip into the goal. The score was tied. The gain and loss were also in an instant. The two kinds of emotions in the audience erupted into huge waves of sound, and their tense expressions were also different. South China also counterattacked, with Liu Songsheng lightly riding on the street, Feng Jingxiang coordinating in the center, and Yang Shuiyi assisting. After a chaotic battle, they had already forced a corner kick. Li Zhaorong raised his foot to shoot, but the Police team's goalkeeper caught it. Yang Shuiyi added another kick, sweeping it into the goal. It was so close, a pity. Li Zhaorong then knocked on the door again. The ball was rolling on the ground with force, but it was still a little short, which was a pity. After that, they went back and forth, and after a few rounds, Liu Qingcai was experienced and prudent, calmly plotting his success, taking the opportunity to intercept the incoming ball, passing through the enemy's vital fortress, and passing it to Jingxiang with short passing skills. Liu Songsheng responded with a single horse on the border, and it was indeed a brilliant move. The Police team was almost forced to make a city alliance. The defender had a sudden inspiration, and then "grabbed Buddha's feet in a hurry." Although Songsheng glared with anger, he had no choice but to show mercy. The referee, seeing his cunning, penalized a free kick, which was taken by Feng Jingxiang, but fearing that the victory would be unchivalrous, he only kicked it lightly, but the goalkeeper was too hasty and failed to block it. The ball went into the net. They fought each other, chasing and fleeing, and the situation became more tense. The two sides fought each other and refused to give way. Before long, Yang Shuiyi got the ball and shot it like an arrow. Fortunately, the Police team had great fortune, hitting the post directly and bouncing out. However, the South China team members never felt discouraged. Liu Songsheng, the Shenxing Taibao, became more and more brave, and Feng Jingxiang, who rose and fell like a rabbit, also became more and more skilled, and guerrilla tactics were launched. The enemy was already exhausted, passing the ball slowly. Chen Dehui and Li Zhaorong were responsible for rushing forward. The ball was like a shuttle weaving back and forth. During the competition, Liu Songsheng dribbled the ball and rushed straight to the Police team's city gate, as if entering no man's land, about to raise his foot to shoot. However, the Police team's defender came up and grabbed him, "shaking hands to make peace, wanting to implement a friendly policy." Liu was restrained, resulting in failure again. The referee penalized another ball, but unfortunately Jingxiang failed to shoot it in. Before long, they were forced to make a corner kick, but fortunately there was no loss. The two rescues of the Great Iron Shovel could not be achieved. Then Jingxiang passed the ball up, and Li Zhaorong made a surprise attack, unhurried and calmly scoring another goal. The first half ended with South China winning 3-1.</p>
<p>Changing the sides to fight again, both teams were forced to corner kicks one after another, but nothing was gained. At this point, the war frequently occurred at the Police team's city gate. A certain member of the team was exceptionally brave, and when a certain member of the South China team rushed to shoot, he "grabbed and dragged him with his hand," and was penalized again, but South China also failed to achieve anything. Once again, Chen Dehui rushed into the city, and the Police team "strictly held him tightly", hugging him tightly, pretending to be a ballroom dance, so he could do nothing. The ball was also empty. However, the Police team's city gate had been in chaos for a long time. Then, they each had corner kicks, but no achievements were made. The Police team was cornered again, and Liu Songsheng took the kick. Feng Jingxiang headed the ball, and the ball broke into the net. The war began to trend violently. The Chinese team lost a corner kick, and the Police team forwards surged forward, but they failed to hit the target after many shots, and the ball flew over the net. The police still tried their best to rush into the city, and Zhang Rongcai was knocked to the ground, suffering a little bit, but fortunately there was no major problem. At this point, the Chinese team's morale was greatly angered, and their energy increased sharply, passing the ball back and forth, following the same pattern. Feng Jingxiang passed it to Zhaorong, who scored another goal. Before long, the ceasefire order was issued, and South China won a great victory with five to one. However, under the watchful eyes of everyone, the close-range combat did not allow the frontline's charge, which was due to the tension of the Police team, and it was also one of the most exciting scenes. The South China lineup is as follows (sent by Zhu Zhaohong):</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, Liu Weipei, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi</p>

<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>(1) Stand upright, separate your feet about one foot apart, stretch your arms above your head, rotate your hands, stand firmly, lean your upper body forward, right, back, left, form a circle, the larger the circle, the better. After rotating ten or twelve circles, continue to spin forward, left and right also rotate in the same way. As for the breathing method, it is best to exhale when the body moves, and pause slightly after completing one circle, while inhaling.</p>
<p>This exercise mainly strengthens the waist, abdomen, and buttocks.</p>
<p>(2) This exercise is similar to the previous one, but instead put your hands on your waist, and place one foot on a chair about 18 inches high, concentrating the weight of the upper body on the other leg. First place your left foot on the chair, and rotate your upper body left and right five times each. After finishing, place your right foot on the chair, and rotate your upper body in the same way.</p>
<p>(3) Stand upright, with your arms hanging down at your sides. First, kick your right leg to the left, as high as possible. At the same time, swing your arms to the right to maintain the balance of your body. Alternate between the left and right legs, and the movements should be harmonious. The knees should not be bent. Do ten to twelve times for each leg. Inhale when kicking the left or right leg, and exhale when putting it down.</p>
<p>This exercise can also be performed lying on the ground, which is very beneficial for the arms and thighs.</p>
<p>(4) Stretch your body straight and lie on your back on the ground. Bend and sit up, bending your upper body forward as much as possible, until your fingers touch your toes. Do a total of ten to fifteen times. Exhale when bending and sitting up, and inhale when lying back.</p>
<p>This exercise is not only a good abdominal exercise, but also stretches the muscles of the back and waist, and increases the flexibility of the body.</p>
<p>(5) Crawling on the ground is actually a very good exercise. In addition to stretching the muscles of all parts of the body and making the body develop evenly, it can also strengthen the back and make the internal organs function actively and normally. When crawling, the legs should not be bent too much, and the arms should also be straight. First crawl forward, then backward. Breathing should be deep and even.</p>
<p>(6) Stand upside down on the ground, with your legs straight and perpendicular to the ground, and your hands supporting your waist to maintain your body's balance. Then alternately stretch your legs backwards as much as possible. The upper body should not move. When one leg stretches backwards, the other leg must remain perpendicular to the ground. Breathing should be even: do ten to fifteen times for each leg.</p>
<p>This exercise requires control of the abdominal muscles and is beneficial for the thighs, buttocks, and waist.</p>
<p>The greatest effect of the six exercises introduced this time is to maintain the balance of the body. The correct posture of the body is a prerequisite for "health" and "beauty". If the body cannot be balanced, it will not be able to take the correct posture. The center of gravity of the body is in the buttocks, but the parts most closely related to the buttocks are the legs, abdomen, and waist. This time, our exercise also focuses on strengthening these parts. (End)</p>

<p>Entertainment...The Baroness and the Butler</p>
<p>Originally a famous stage play, now adapted into a movie, the story itself has a strong comedic flavor, and the hard work of the humorous star William Powell and Anna Bella has made this film an excellent and successful work.</p>
<p>William Powell plays a waiter who is the most capable servant in the Earl's family. He handles all aspects of housework in an orderly manner, and the entire Earl's family is very satisfied with him. But unexpectedly, this waiter is secretly engaged in political activities and is elected as a member of parliament, and is standing on the side of the party that is opposed to his master. In his profession, he is a loyal servant, but in politics, he publishes political opinions and meticulously attacks his master. The Earl is considered broad-minded and has a corresponding understanding of him. The most unconvinced is the Earl's daughter, a standard noble lady (played by Anna Bella), and under this situation of disputes and contradictions, a series of jokes are made.</p>
<p>There are extremely wonderful dialogues in the film, and there is truth in the humor and wit. William Powell's style has not changed. In his calmness, there is a place where people can be stunned. Anna Bella is still appearing in an American-made film for the first time in this film, and she also has an extremely excellent performance.</p>
<p>Queen...Touchdown Army</p>
<p>Most of this film is based on the West Point Military Academy in the United States, showing strict discipline and neat exercises, and interspersing a triangular love comedy, and ending with a tense and lively football game. This kind of story's material has been seen countless times, but the performance of the whole drama still has considerable achievements.</p>
<p>The content describes a frivolous playboy who is willing to enter the military academy for a woman and endure all kinds of hardships. Unexpectedly, the woman's hard work has already belonged to someone else. Later, because of his superb football skills, he made a big splash and won the woman's favor.</p>
<p>Most of the football games and exercises in the film are edited from current affairs films, but because of the skillful technology, it does not show any traces. John Howard plays a small teacher in the film, not as exciting as his detective films.</p>
<p>Peace...White Banners</p>
<p>Adapted from the recent book "Self-Flag" by the writer Wright Douglas, the story itself is very interesting. The script of this play is well-made, and the arrangement of the actors is also appropriate. The performance of the whole film is extremely moving. Because it is too ethical, it may not be of interest to the general public, but if you watch it patiently, it will give people a feeling that it is desirable.</p>
<p>Clauto Lens has always performed very well, and this time he plays a teacher who loves his work, and his performance can be said to be immersive. In addition, several supporting actors, such as Fei Feide, Jacques Cooper, and the child star Nite Tagrenville, who has always played villain roles, have changed their style and played an enthusiastic girl, all of whom are excellent and satisfying.</p>
<p>Oriental...Mad About Music</p>
<p>A very touching tragicomedy, some parts of the story are relatively weak, but because of the comedy relationship, it is not a problem. The director has handled the whole film very tightly, and every progress can grasp the humor of the comedy.</p>
<p>Dina Dopi's performance is extremely wonderful, several songs are also very moving, and the supporting roles are also perfect.</p>
<p>Dahua...The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</p>
<p>It is a very tolerant literary film, which is adapted from Mark Twain's book. Although the whole film is very long, the director has handled it properly. The light and lively tone makes us not feel bored. Part of it is also due to the outstanding performances of a generation of child stars, especially the two protagonists. Mei Zasun, who plays the aunt, also performs very well.</p>
<p>King Star...Divorce of Lady X</p>
<p>A funny love film, the story is of course lacking in possibility. The whole film is set on a foggy night in London. A large group of people looking for pleasure in the hotel were forced to not go back and had to look for rooms in the hotel. As a result, a husband (Maner Obelran) broke into the room of a single male guest, and the story unfolded like this.</p>
<p>The interest is quite strong, but it is still too late for the British style. The whole film is dyed with color, which adds a lot of beauty.</p>
<p>New World...The One True Love Seed</p>
<p>Starring Xu Manli and Kuang Shanxiao</p>
<p>Central...The Pearl Shirt</p>
<p>It was not long before Chen Zhaoli of Hollywood passed away, and the Chinese film industry produced Chen Zhaoli. This kind of speculative plan does not require publicity and can reap the benefits of the box office. The intelligence of Chinese filmmakers can be seen here. However, the arrangement of the content and story of this film is not perfect. At the same time, each tense scene has not been fully developed. The description of the behavior of the bandits is more failure than success. The distribution of actors is also not very suitable. Except for Liu Qiong, who has considerable success, Gu Lanjun and Hong Jingling did not do much in the play. Xu Huayuan's Chen Zhaoli. The facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of the movements is still not satisfactory.</p>

<p>The difficulty of treating toxic diseases is well known.

Therefore, the treatment device sucks out the toxic system from the urethral diverticulum and then injects the medicine. The urethral diverticulum naturally attracts, and at the same time makes the mucosa congest. Bacteria work vigorously, promoting the absorption of diseased cell infiltration, and toxic diseases can be cured.

<p>— Qiu Yang</p>
<p>Low houses, the tile roofs piled with several layers of yellow dust, the residents all moved to the countryside! Letting the roofs be blasted open by the Japanese invaders' cannons, or the walls pierced through. Especially the area near the east side of the station. Whether they were bombs from airplanes, or heavy shells flying from across the Yellow River, people inside didn't have time to escape. They didn't care about shells or bombs. All they could remember forever was that our houses were destroyed by Japanese devils.</p>
<p>This is Tongguan. It occupies the border of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi. It is a major defense for the Northwest. It has a glorious history. Two majestic city towers stand tall, though it's said that a part was demolished to reduce targets for the invaders. But it still overlooks everything on the banks of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The sky looks like it's going to snow. Heavy dark clouds cover the vast expanse of the sky. The north wind cuts like sharp scissors, attacking the skin of the soldiers, carrying with it a lingering, nauseating smell of sulfur and smoke from the mountains outside the city, into this deserted city.</p>
<p>The Yellow River comes down from the north, makes a turn here, and flows east. Along the southern bank of the river, across the Longhai Railway, for several miles along the mountains, countless brave soldiers are ambushed under solid fortifications. The gunners are constantly transporting shells to the shooters. The thick smoke and the thunderous sound invigorate and excite every soldier, making them forget the cold, forget the fatigue.</p>
<p>"Bombard the invaders' artillery positions! Discovered! Quick!"</p>
<p>"Thirty-five degrees, inclined aim!"</p>
<p>The battalion commander, using his binoculars, excitedly jumped and shouted, then put down the binoculars, measured the proper angle, and ordered the gunner to fire.</p>
<p>The invaders' shells seemed to have discovered this artillery position. The shells exploded a hundred meters away, fragments of rock and yellow-black dust flying in all directions. One by one, they hit the solid loess, creating deep pits. The battalion commander's horse was wounded, neighing and jumping, blood flowing from its belly. Then three orderlies also fell, a piece of their head blown off, their hands grasping at the air, their feet twitching once or twice, and then nothing. Their dead heads soaked in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>The heavy artillery roared towards the opposite bank, and the yellow, desolate beachhead over there likewise rose up with yellow dust, rushing towards the sky.</p>
<p>The battalion commander jumped up excitedly. "That's right, damn it! Fire again!" He held the binoculars in his left hand, and gripped a shell lying on the ground in his right hand.</p>
<p>The gunners were sweating, their faces flushed with excitement.</p>
<p>After a long time, the invaders' cannons stopped firing. This side also stopped firing. The battalion commander quietly turned around, stood at attention, bowed his head in silent mourning for the dead orderlies. The artillerymen also stood up to offer a solemn tribute to the fallen.</p>
<p>The north bank is desolate. In the distance, there are black things, like wrecked vehicles, standing motionless. The Yellow River flows with yellow, muddy water. The Longhai Railway on the south bank bends along the mountains, around behind the mountains. In this lonely land, not a single person is seen. Tongguan stands peacefully. At this moment, snow begins to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e86">A Soviet "Poet Laureate" <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shih-huai</p>
<p>In the early days of the revolution, the poet D. Bedny was undoubtedly a shining star in the Soviet poetry scene. The title of "Poet Laureate" belonged to him. However, the rise and fall of writers, like the fluctuations of society, are inevitable. After 1923, the Soviet Union began a period of proletarian poetry writing. The dazzling title of this "Poet Laureate" fell upon a young poet, Bexymensky. Bexymensky had a deep understanding of politics and a surprisingly firm ideology. His themes lacked any traditional sentimentality. "Let others think of spring!" he said.</p>
<p>"But I walk and walk, and stubbornly</p>
<p>Think of the capital of Soviet food."</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"Some worry about girls' lips,</p>
<p>But I worry about chimneys."</p>
<p>He was such a rigid and calm man, but life had a good taste for him. His first book was called "That's How Life Tastes."</p>
<p>Bexymensky's style differed from those influenced by the Symbolist school earlier, such as the "Forge" group. His works were similar to Mayakovsky's. He fully accepted Mayakovsky's crude and exaggerated grammar. However, after Mayakovsky committed suicide, he criticized Mayakovsky again. That is to say, he was learning from Mayakovsky with a critical attitude.</p>
<p>His dramatic poem "The Shot" written in 1930 revealed his keen understanding of politics. During the period of the Five-Year Plan, he was the most enthusiastic writer supporting the government's policies. Long poems such as "Tragic Night" and "Night of the Political Commissar" are all about the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, some people say that Bexymensky's success lay in politics, not in poetry. In fact, another factor in his success was that he often tried his best to achieve "popularization" in his poetry. He wrote poems on the road, next to the kiosk, in the theater boxes, not in his room. The nationwide fame of his poetry cannot be separated from the warm welcome of the Soviet people.</p>

<p>His fish shop has two storefronts. The shop floor is very empty, making it the most suitable place for us to rest. This fish shop is very much like a "trust." All the fish carriers from outside have to go to the shop first and then sell them outside. We haven't seen a single carrier selling fish alone on the street. Such a special product of exploitation is the first time I've seen in the countryside. Even if you stop the carrier and want to trade directly with the fisherman, he will still shake his head and refuse. The locals love to eat fish, and the fish prices are indeed very cheap. In the morning, the entrance of the fish shop is crowded with people. The fish shop owner stands high on a long table, specializing in weighing fish. There are also people collecting money and taking care of the baskets.</p>
<p>"Three hundred ah!" After weighing the fish, the owner shouts this out, drawing out the end sound. The buyer takes the fish from the scale with the basket, and then pays the money to the cashier. This is always the procedure, and people come and go in the hustle and bustle. The owner's shout resounds throughout the entire street:</p>
<p>"One dime ah!——"</p>
<p>"Four hundred ah!——"</p>
<p>I still remember the last time I came here for camping. People were exhausted from walking the day before, and were bitten badly by mosquitoes at night. I really hoped to get a good sleep this morning, but unexpectedly I was awakened by the shouting.</p>
<p>Today, it's noon now. The trading has long ended.</p>
<p>New peanuts are on the market, piled up in heaps. The smoked meat in the restaurant is so tempting. When you become a soldier, you can't imagine how you will turn into a rabbit. Just as when you become a soldier, you will have words like "damn it" hanging on your lips. These are all indispensable phenomena. But when I touch my pocket, it's empty except for a stack of toilet paper, and I lose all hope for everything. No, I'll find another way.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, treat!"</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the food displayed on the chopping board at the entrance of the restaurant, expecting a reply.</p>
<p>"No, that stuff isn't clean."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you order some peanuts?"</p>
<p>"That's a good idea."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Arriving at the Fourth District of Guoyang <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Memories of Breaking Through from Xuzhou</p>
<p>After a considerable battle, we didn't reach Xulu until 9 o'clock last night. The Japanese invaders, who ambushed us when we passed through Xulu at night, abandoned three or four hundred corpses and a lot of guns and ammunition, and fled in disarray.</p>
<p>Distributing the captured spoils of war, the team continued to advance mightily.</p>
<p>The sky was clear and cloudless. The sun was terribly hot. The sand and soil on the road were scorched like a red-hot iron pot. The wheat seedlings in the fields lay quietly under the gentle caress of the sun.</p>
<p>There was no wind at all. Bearing a tree branch, dragging two terribly painful feet with blisters that had burst and re-blistered, walking limping on that deadly hot dirt road. I was terribly thirsty, and sweat just kept pouring out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Japanese plane appeared in the sky. The advancing troops immediately hid under the trees and in the wheat fields.</p>
<p>The Japanese plane circled overhead once, and after no result, flew away. Then the troops reunited into a stream of iron, advancing.</p>
<p>As soon as we encountered water, even if it was very dirty, people swarmed around like a hive of bees, scrambling to drink it.</p>
<p>It was already past 5 o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the fourth district of Guoyang County. This was a fairly large ancient city, but it was already empty. Not a single civilian was left. It is said that the enemy had occupied this place a week ago. Outside the city, there were still enemy telephone lines left behind...</p>
<p>We couldn't find anything to eat in the city. After carrying a few people who hadn't had a good night's sleep, and having a rough meal, unbearable hunger and fatigue led me to a stone bridge, more than ten yards long and more than two yards wide, outside the city, where I sat and waited for the team to depart.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun had just set below the horizon, and the western sky was a brilliant red glow. The evening breeze carried a pleasant coolness, slowly blowing. Under the bridge was half a river of clear water, and three or four ducks, whose owner had fled to who knows where, were freely swimming in the river.</p>
<p>Looking at this poetic scene, a tense heart that had been living in battle every day suddenly became relaxed. We almost forgot that we were breaking through.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a group of people walked over the bridge. Among them were Northeast Army, Sichuan Army, Guangxi Army... Watching their difficult gait, like some small-footed women, twisting their waists as they walked, I almost couldn't help laughing.</p>
<p>In fact, our walking posture was no different from theirs, but we had forgotten our own pain.</p>
<p>After midnight, under the bright moonlight, the team solemnly set out for Guoyang along the highway.</p>
<h3 id="e89">10,000 Tons of Knowledge <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>No one needs to worry about the destruction of a culture. Although the birth and growth of a culture is extremely difficult, its preservation and regeneration are quite simple. Because it can be preserved in knowledge, and regeneration through knowledge is not difficult.</p>
<p>The most refined things of a culture are preserved by human brains. The culture that can be regenerated by even an unremarkable modern person's active brain can generally easily amaze our counterparts from five hundred or even two hundred years ago. If humans could imitate such delicate machines as brains, and make them like recording devices and cameras, so that they could be passed down from generation to generation, then the ancient idea of "the universe is all contained within this inch" could truly be realized.</p>
<p>Someone once said that anyone can write a book. This is a limited definition of "book." If we asked everyone to write down everything they know, from how to pick apples to how to connect wireless wires, then each person would certainly write more than their own weight in books. Everyone knows that if everyone really wrote everything down, the resulting works, nineteen of which would be the same, would be an unnecessary and huge waste. But almost no one has ever doubted whether the seemingly necessary waste of each person's brain gradually storing knowledge, nineteen of which are the same as others, is a mistake. Naturally, someone has also said that a superior mind is not able to memorize more than ordinary people, but is able to forget what does not need to be remembered. But this is only regarded as a strange saying.</p>
<p>Humanity's boast, the special skill of being able to communicate complex meanings, is a recent achievement, and its progress is actually very short. All of our tools for communicating meaning are still very clumsy, and the tools for preserving what can be communicated are even clumsier. Bring back the primitive people who wore tree leaves, and they will not understand our rayon clothing. Bring back the prehistoric people who lived in caves, and they will not understand our skyscraper architecture. But bring back the Babylonians and Egyptians who read brick books and papyrus books, and show them our Chinese and Western books, and they will certainly point out without hesitation that these are books.</p>
<p>We can permanently preserve and use brains to preserve culture. What we rely on most is still books. This naturally makes our preservation work more cumbersome, but it is still much more convenient than preserving all cultural products in their original form. Many lost cultural objects can be easily reproduced with book knowledge. The reason we don't do that is probably only because we have put them in the category of things that should be forgotten. Naturally, there are also people who simply do not admit that there are imitations that can match the originals, but that is just a superstition. This superstition exists at the same time as the other belief that genius will find its own way. Since the goal is to surpass one's predecessors, the difference from one's predecessors is naturally not failing to catch up, but throwing them off. Only the antique flavor that collectors praise is created by time. Later generations will naturally be at a disadvantage in terms of time. However, the antique flavor of fake antiques buried for ten years is often enough to confuse the real with the fake, so time is also somewhat controlled. The re-excavation of lost ancient cultures is still a part of cultural work, but those re-excavated things are often prepared to be discarded again, while at the same time the discarding of other aspects is carried out on a massive scale.</p>
<p>When necessary, the tools for preserving culture—books—must also be discarded. The reason why some of them are discarded is because of the books themselves. This provides us with convenience in preservation, but also exposes the weaknesses of our tools, and perhaps at the same time vaguely reveals our psychological dissatisfaction with these tools. This psychology will be the source of progress, but it is also inevitably error-prone. We can now easily reduce errors to a minimum. As far as the preservation of the tool of books is concerned, even if there is a copy of every publication since the invention of books, it probably wouldn't be a very large number. If we preserve all of them, it wouldn't be too cumbersome.</p>
<p>It is necessary to think about what kind of number it is. In my own ordinary brain, I can't remember where I saw it, and I don't know where to find an answer. However, I remember that in a idle talk, someone raised the strange question, "I'm afraid that since the invention of books, mankind has not yet written ten million kinds, right?" This question was also discussed for quite some time. Friends who felt that there were more than this number cited that the US Library of Congress has about nine million volumes of books and magazines, and that England, America, Germany, France, and Russia each publish 10,000 to 20,000 new books every year. If the output of other countries combined is half of the total output of these five countries, then there are more than 100,000 kinds published every year. Since the 20th century, the output has been roughly this amount every year. In the twentieth century there have already been four million new books. Not to mention the forty or so centuries before that. Those who felt that there were only this number thought that if ten million kinds were divided equally among fifty centuries, it would be 200,000 kinds per century. If this were the output in the fifth century BC, no one would think it was too little. Counting backwards and forwards, we estimate that there were two million new books in the nineteenth century, which is also enough to allocate. Moreover, if we assume that each book is of a considerable size, with 300 pages and 200,000 words, and small pamphlets are combined into collections (such as the Old and New Testaments), and duplicates are not counted, then the number of books in the twentieth century may not have reached one million. Ten million is a large number.</p>
<p>If we would rather believe the latter, then its volume is only 10,000 cubic meters, its weight is only 10,000 tons, and its value is only 50 million yuan. According to the printing price of Chinese reprints of Western books, if we print 100 copies of each kind, the total cost would only be 200 million yuan, which is less than one-fifth of the annual expenditure of the American printing industry. This number is almost pitifully small. If only one copy of each existed, and they could be gathered together to destroy them, it wouldn't even need a hundred-pound bomb. However, if the quantity is small, it is easier to preserve. A corner is enough to hide a copy and escape the power of destruction. We can believe that even if the world will have another flood, there will be another Noah's Ark to preserve culture, and that Ark is already big enough.</p>
