<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">英法秘密協定與德意日軍事同盟 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨晚美聯社倫敦電訊傳：『英法兩國已簽訂祕密協定，彼此同意合力防護比利時，荷蘭，及瑞士，抵抗外來惡勢力的侵略』。另一方面，同社柏林電又報：『據極可靠方面消息，德意日反共協定，不久卽將變爲軍事同盟協定』。這是世界侵略陣綫與反侵略陣線對立尖銳化必然的歸宿。本來，德意日軍事同盟醞釀已久，月前柏林德意日三國軍事外交聯席會議，卽有簽訂的現實性，在今日希特勒覺有更進一步推行新侵略並穩定舊侵略的時候，德國更積極要求意日兩國再出來搖旗納喊，聲援德國，也是當然的必有的歸宿，是無足驚奇的。柏林外交界相信：「果歐洲『反希特勒陣綫』完成，則爲德意日三國進行軍事同盟的絕好樓」（昨日美聯社電）。其實，卽無「反希特勒陣綫」成立，德意日的軍事同盟，仍是要實現的。「納粹」方面吐露「此次軍事同盟的談判早已開始進行若干時候」，倒是老實話，只這種老實話在這時候發表，或者另有別種用意罷了。</p>
<p>關於德意日之侵略者的勾結，要深切認識的是他們目前的作風。希特勒現在不但侵佔斯洛伐克，吞併了米美爾，並且壓服了羅馬尼亞和德國簽訂經濟協定。希特勒在這短期間狼吞虎嚥了不少東西，無論他的胄口怎樣強健，總須略事休息才行。但是這個「英雄的軍人」（、戈林的媚詞）的手段，是與衆不同的。据我們的推測，希特勒雖然需要略事休息，事實上也須暫時休息，但却必然採取「以進爲退」的政略。其辦法當不外乎（一）多發些恐嚇英法的宣言，多做些打擊英法的手勢；（二）拉攏並嗾使帮兇的意日在地中海及遠東更積極動作起來，以威脅英法不要千涉他在東歐的收拾，以便他安然獲得更大的效果。日前柏林各報皆擴大宣傳：慕索里尼將於下星期日作如何如何強硬的演說；昨晚德國『亞通報』又威稱：「意大利將以極強硬手段向法國提出要求」，同時並替慕案里尼打氣：「意大利的要求，如德國要求的重要，必要時兩國將共同奮鬥」，又說：「相信意大利將不於必戰爭中獲得滿意」。另一方面，日本內閣通宵達旦地召集緊急閣，「討論關於國德吞幷捷克後引起的歐洲局勢，及日本應採取的新外交政策」。日本的所謂新外交政策，据我們的觀察，當不外乎兩端：其一更進一步和德意兩帮兇作更密切的聯絡，或竟完全聽從希特勒的要求，着重於在遠東脅逼英法，其二乘此機會更積極發動華中及華南的軍事行動，威逼中國「屈服」，以便結束泥足愈陷愈深的侵華戰爭。脆弱的日本帝國主義，自知沒有力量可以發動兩頭的戰爭，並且明瞭希特勒目前也絕對不會對蘇聯進攻，所以放棄北進而側重於南進。日方已向蘇聯屈服，願意參加蘇聯漁區的競賣投標；在華中及華南的軍事行動也更加蠢動起來了。希特勒的確是一個聰明絕頂的「英雄」，意日完全成了希特勒的兩手了。</p>
<p>然而在侵略陣綫日益鞏固加強的情勢下，反侵略陣綫的發展如何呢？所傳英法祕密協定或許有相當的可能性，四强宣言也可以發出，美國决定不承認德國吞併美米爾，民主集團的力量固然日益增强，但總覺得脆弱，遲緩，泛散，甚至太過於自私和孤立。蘇聯召集歐洲九國會議的提議，似乎將如我們的推測，不能够實現，奠蘇更具體的合作，暫時也沒有實現的可能。卽就所傳英法祕密協定加以考察，英法所謀者只限於安定中歐，他們要加保護的只有比利時，荷蘭，及瑞士等中歐小國，至於東歐各國則已置諸腦後，無怪東歐諸小國，個個被希特勒擊破，個個爭向「納粹東征十字軍」屈服。</p>
<p>今日，我們不能已於言者，英法應該乘希特勒狂暴之後需要休息的時候，對侵略者表示更強硬的態度，以阻止意日帮兇的乘勢妄動；另一方面應更誠懇和美蘇乃至其他各小國切實聯絡，締成「反侵略陣線」。時勢已逼，「反侵略陣線」是不許再長此泛散下去，猜忌下去了。卽空洞的虛張，也已不能够阻止侵略者的狂妄了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">戰時民主政治與省市縣參議會 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 梅真</p>
<p>國民參政會正式成立以後，建立地方參政會及建立地方民意機開之聲，卽已囂然塵上，縷成舉國一致的要求，當局乃有組織省市縣參議會的决定，及其　織法的公佈。其後因爲各地情形不同，並多數省市未能依限呈報名單。茲因抗戰建國已入嶄新階段，全國民力急待集中發揮，建立地方民意機關之需要尤感迫急，茲就省市縣參議會在目前階段所負偉大的歷史意義，及其對於爭取抗戰建最後成功的重大任務，略加論述，以供關心國事諸君的參攷。</p>
<p>一，抗戰時期實行民主的急需</p>
<p>中華民族抗戰建國之最後成功，是與實行民主法治制度不能分離的。去年國民黨臨時全國代表大會之决定召集國民參政會，其目的卽在適應抗戰建國之迫急需要，集中全國的力量，以排除空前的國難，集合全國的意志，以建立民治建國的基礎。二月廿一日蔣委員長在第三次參政會閉幕詞中也說：「本會（參政會）的歷史的使命，是要建立民主政治基礎，尤其是建立永久的眞正的民主政治基礎。……總理倡導三民主義，其民權主義的最終目的，就是民主政治，一國的人民如果不能關切自身的幸福，管理他們自己共同的事務，就是說，如果人民不能積極參加政治的話，他們就不能造成幸福的國家。所以世界上最大最有力最鞏固的政治，一定建築在民意之上，一定要以人民之利害爲利害，人民的視聽爲視聽。總　的理想是要造成一個民有民治民享的國家，古今中外理無二致。我們現在是一面抗戰一面建國。要得到抗戰勝利，建國成功，絕不能專賴兵力，必須動員民衆的精神，組織民衆已發動的精神，以全國的精神意志力量的總和，來做前方將士的後盾，來做後方開發的策動力。所以充實軍力以外，更必集合民意。去年臨時　表大會所以决議召集國民參政會，就是一面希望全國的眞正民意，能够藉我們參政員而具體表現，使政府可以了解人民的痛苦，知道人民的希望，作爲施政的依據。同時希望我們參政員以其地位資望經驗，表示人民與抗戰建國的大計，積極貢献我們才力和經驗」，「在這一個抗戰艱苦的時期，造成眞正的民主政治的民族」。由此已可想見在此抗戰艱苦時期，更需要民主政治的積極推進，然後才能順利實現動員民衆組織民衆，發動全國的精神意志力量。</p>
<p>毛澤東先生在其「論新階段」這篇著名的報吿中亦曾明確的說：「民主政治是發動全民族一切生動力量的推進機，有了這種制度，全民人民的抗日積極性將會不可計量地發動起來，成爲取之不盡用之不竭的深淵源。我全民族澈底地統一國結的偉大過程之完成，也只有依　民主制度之建立。」他還說：「關於這一點……都是為着密切政府與人民的聯系，增加政府的實力，使之能在抗日戰爭中起其重大的作用。沒有問題，全國任何地方政府，應集中於中央政府領導之下，不應因行政區域在地域上之被×分割而有任何不遵重中央領導的表現。全國必須依照中央法令而相行民主制的，但全國必須是統一於中央的。』由此更可想見，如果不在今日積極推行民全政治，如果不在今日積極改進政治則將不能支持長期艱苦的抗日戰爭，則將不能實現抗戰的勝利與建國的成功。</p>
<p>這次第三次國民參政會，亦經通過了黃炎培等五十人所提「請確立民主法制度，以奠定建國基礎案」，其原案開首亦卽明白指出：「値此抗戰日益有利，建國正在開始之際，尤宜勵民主法治之制度，以期訓政最有實質之成就，而爲憲政預立　同的基礎。」此外這次大會並曾通過參政員董必武等二十七人所提「加强民債主義的實現，發揮民氣以利抗戰案」。由此變可證明在此抗戰建國新階段必須迅速切定推行民主政治，不僅是有全國最高領袖的英明的明示，並且亦爲全國代表民意的參政員諸君的共同要求。所有這些，都可表現我們建立民主政治基礎的工作，今後將有更重要更切實的開展，而爲中華民族革命史目開闢空前燦爛的一頁。</p>
<p>二、省市縣參議會的重要地位</p>
<p>眞正的民主政治，在於廣大人民之獲得參加國家政治的種種機會和組織。目前中國抗戰建國，其目的不僅在以抗戰驅逐日×還我河山，並且在於以抗戰建立民有民治民享的三民主義的新中國，也就要在抗戰的艱苦過程中，同時逐漸實現民主政治，而今日第一步最迫切的要求，就是在於廣大人民之獲得積極參加抗戰建國工作的種種機會和組織。我們在這裏，便不能不對全國範圍的參政會和全國各地方的參議會，致其深切的期望。</p>
<p>（一）國民參政會與民主</p>
<p>國民參政會旣不同於當世民主各國的議會組織，同時也不是我們所需要所希望的純粹的民意機關，但是根據國參會成立的動機及其成立以來的成績，則已可無愧於「抗戰期間過渡性質的民意機關」的令譽，在中華民族的建國史上。已應佔有光榮之葉。蔣委員長之指示國民參政會的歷史的使命，就在要「建立民主政治基礎尤其是永久的眞正的民主政治基礎」，尤當爲我們所信賴。</p>
<p>不過要使國民參政會眞正能够無辱及無愧於其偉大的使命，第一就在於參政會的組織參政員的產生，須是依　國父中山先生民權主義的原則的，關於這一點，當然還待我們的努力，促其澈底實現。第二，就在於每一個參政員那明瞭其爲勤勞的生產的人民的代表，而隨時隨處堅持其光榮與重大的地位，這一點，自從該會議長汪精衛叛離祖國以後，已給人以鮮明的表現而令人敬信。第三，則更有賴於全國輿論界的宣傳鼓動與全國覺悟民衆之踴躍參加；這一點我們過去做得非常不够，尤其是一般國民對於參政會比較冷淡的態度，都需要我們加倍努力改進的地方。</p>
<p>（二）參政會過去的成就</p>
<p>但是，國民參政會成立以來尙未足一年，而其對於推進民主政治協助抗戰建國方面的偉大成就，却同應爲我們所軍視的。第一是在第一次大會通過了擁護抗戰建國綱領案，在第二次大會通過了擁護持久抗戰的國策案，在第三次大會通過了擁護持久抗戰國策案。增强了政府和人民的力量，澄淸了中外的視聽，一方面給×人漢奸主唱的反共停戰妥協陰謀以一大打擊，一方面提高了全國堅持團結抗戰建國的自尊心與自信心。第二是通過了許多關於軍事民蓮內政外交財政經濟敎育文化各部門的重要議案，這些議案大多已經爲政府接受或已逐步實施，對於抗戰建國，已經盡了相當重大的作用。第三，如蔣委員長在參政會三次大會開會詞中所說：「參政員除努力參加會議外，還有許多位在會外從事於抗戰建國的實際工作，不論在戰區，在後方，都有我們參政員冒險犯難堅苦卓絕的努力的成績。」</p>
<p>蔣委員長同時又提醒大家：『我們全國賢者能者，領袖人士的精神，能提振起來，打通政府與人民的意志，集政府和人民的力量，這種效力，較之提高前綫上官兵勇敢犧牲的精神，還要大十倍！』可是，關於這一點，如果祗依賴幾位參政員的努力，事實上自然還不够，各地方民意機關的儘速建立，在員前階段，便感覺到特別重要了！</p>
<p>（三）抗戰新階段的省市縣參議會</p>
<p>目前抗戰新階段，是制止×人的進攻準備我軍的反攻的階段，也可說是轉敗爲勝轉客爲主準備驅盡××光夏河山的階段，爲要爭取這一階段的勝利成功，就在乎加緊打擊削弱×人的一切力量，尤其是在於加緊我們新生力量的增長，這就有恃於全民族生動力量的總動員，而各地方民意機關之　遠建立及切實負責，更顯得重要了。</p>
<p>爲要　速建立地方民意機關，當局已經决定設立省市縣臨時參議會。現在各省市均已奉命儘速籌備，廣東省亦己决於四月一日正式成立。我們除了希望各省市縣都能儘速籌備成立以外，鑒於抗戰新階段的迫切需要，各省市縣臨時參議會，至少要達到以下幾點：</p>
<p>第一，各省市縣臨時參議會，必須成爲一個眞正的地方民意機關，努力於實行民主政治的基礎工作。</p>
<p>第二，發揚國民參政會的精神，密切政府與民衆的聯系。</p>
<p>第三，更廣大實現全民埃精神與物力的總動員，以適應前綫後方和×後鬥爭的新需要。</p>
<p>三，一個臨時參議會的模範</p>
<p>自從政府公佈省市縣臨時參議會的組織法並下令限期成立以後，陝廿寧邊區政府首先遵奉命令，積極籌備，業於今年二月初旬在延安舉行成立大會，似乎値得其他省市縣作重要的參玫。據二月七日美聯社從延安拍出的電報說：</p>
<p>陝甘　邊區臨時參議會，是中國壓史上第一次的民衆立法代表大會，在此間開會一星期，業已閉幕，該會通過重案如下：</p>
<p>一、免費分配田地給從前綫歸來的兵士。</p>
<p>一、實行沒收漢奸財產。</p>
<p>一、禁止患花柳病者，痳瘋病者，瘋症者，息不治症者結婚。</p>
<p>一、凡女子在十八歲以下男子在二十歲以下者，不得結婚。</p>
<p>一，規定離婚法，凡重婚者，意見不合者，私通者，不能生育者，均得離婚。</p>
<p>一，保障言論，出版，宗敎，集會的自由。</p>
<p>一，買行男女兩性政治上經濟上社會上一律平等。</p>
<p>一、實行國內各民族一律平等，准許五族少之數集團維持原來的風俗及家敎。</p>
<p>一，强迫實施軍事訓練。</p>
<p>一，政府敦濟病者，老者，孤兒，寡婦。</p>
<p>一，施行農等教育，開墾荒地，保護森林。</p>
<p>一，政府官員及學生，均須自食其力，以減少政府費用。（各級官員及學生一律供給衣服飲食住宿及五元以下之薪俸）</p>
<p>一，實行每日工作八小時制。</p>
<p>一，廢止高利貸，由政府貸款於民衆，酌收低徵利息。</p>
<p>一，建立並組織政府及法庭之法律，除農民捐出百分之七以下之農產品外，禁止各種苛捐雜稅。</p>
<p>又據邊區政附主席林伯渠（祖涵）對美聯社記者說：「在一九三七年，民衆推選各區的代表開會，這次則以隱名投票法選舉邊區代表大會的代表，這是初次會議，舉凡行政官史，都以這種方法選出。凡各地工人農民及中產階級，均依人數選出代表。這次立法會議結果。業已樹立民主政治之初步基礎。」</p>
<p>四，戰時民治的實際設施</p>
<p>抗戰建國最後勝利成功的主要保證，便是集中領導下的民主政治的逐步實施，而抗戰建國時期實施民主政治的主要保證，則是國民參政曾工作順利與切實的開展和各省市縣參議會之成爲眞正的民意機關。過去一年來國民參政會的偉大成就與各省市縣參議會的先後成立或籌備成立，我們已經開始踏進了實施民主政治的第一步，今後只要有大家合力督促及協助這全國與地方民意機關一切工作之加緊推進，以及這些機關的一切决議之爲政府認眞切實的一一實施，逐漸地推進真正的民主政治。但爲保障這種重大工作的順利進行起見，我們覺得還有迅速切實注意以下幾點的必要：　，第一是要保證國民寫「抗戰建　綱領」所擬定的人民言論，出版，集　，結社，宗敎與思想信仰的自由，以便當遍發揮全民族所有抗戰建國的力量。我們一面要絕對保證中央一切法令在全國各地實　不受任何地方的隨意限制，另一方面則要限制那些違反抗戰建國的言論行動的自由，限制漢好，和親日派的言論行動的自由。</p>
<p>第二，是要遵從最高領袖最近迭次宣言文吿中的昭示，在戰在與×人後方及淪陷地區，開始實行澈底的民主政治，建立抗日革命的民主政權。至於具體辦法，如實行民題各級地方政府再由上級加委，如在戰區各級政府採用民主權的委員制，並設立各級人民代表機關，如戰區政府增設若干必要的工作部門，如淸除貪汚腐化分子。吸收願爲抗日建國而獻身的積極份子，以及規定戰區地方政府得在中央統一領導下有頒佈地方舉行法規之權。規定戰區男女公民凡非漢奸親日份子均有選舉被選舉權，以及言論出版集會結社與武裝抗日之權等，並可實行戰區一切抗戰黨派均有公開合法地位，以便進一步實現眞正的民主政治，使全民族一切精神物質的力量做到眞正的動員集中統一運用。</p>
<p>抗戰建國，是長期的艱苦的事業，民族革命成功，前途尙極遼遠，我們必須堅持全國長期的團結，必須加緊全民精神總動員，更須努力促進戰時集中領導下的民主政治的實行。</p>
<h3 id="c3">西康之寶庫（上） <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>康定通訊，軍興以來，沿海各港口，多被日人封鎖，一切戰時平時之資源，均受莫大影響，開發資源，補充前綫，實爲當前急務。西康物產豐富，蘊鑛尤多，建省以來，當局對於各種天然資源，旣已注意查勘，而亘古以來類似神秘未經開拓之處女地，亦將積極利用，分別開發矣。</p>
<p>榮經多礦</p>
<p>記者此次入康，考察各部門事業，對於蘊藏鑛產，特別注意，上月道出榮經時，已將該縣赤鐵鑛蘊量及質地，詳加考查，據實報道，惟榮經鑛產，不僅赤鐵一種，花尖子，班鳩井，花岩一帶之有烟煤礦，及榮河流域之無烟煤礦，亦有多量之蘊藏，而全縣各區，銅鑛亦富，此外如大相嶺一帶所產尺許以上對徑之硬木，可供鐵道枕木之用者，不下數百萬株，大好榮經，殆不啻一實庫，國入宜如何利用，開發此豐富資源，以充實力量，是應請當局特加注意者也。</p>
<p>銅鑛停辦</p>
<p>榮經位於雅安西南，峯高谷深，天險陡險，扼川康之孔道，境內鑛藏之當，冠於康東，煤鐵之外，銅鑛亦豐，經記者連日調查得悉該縣銅鑛，遍於各區，以北區戴黃溝，山溪林之鑛爲最有希望，而東區前後驟壩之鑛次之，查山溪林銅鑛之發現，並未經若干朝代，所經營之舊洞，深度亦只三四十丈，其停辦原因，確爲陽水淹沒，並非鑛竭放棄。故今日重行開發，必仍沿山溪林舊洞進行，方有把握。查過去該區鑛廠有二，一爲馬姓之　興廠，創辦於光緒二十年間，一爲李姓之三元廠，至民初已鑿到四十丈深時，因開採向四周發展，掘穿寶典洞壁，水勢橫洩而入，亦即同歸於盡，停辦至今，良可惜也。</p>

<h3 id="c4">精神動員的重要 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 宋美齡</p>
<p>一個人生了病，必須請醫生療治，乃是現代生活中很普通的道理。姿使疾病得以治療，先得診斷病源。若有施行外科手術的必要，應當毫不遲疑地請醫生開刀。如果發現病人的內部組織因生活上的忽略而受到根本的妨礙，當然也得採取一種緊急的措置來恢復它的常態。</p>
<p>個人旣是這樣，國家和國家的行政機構當然也是這樣；對於組織完備，治理適當的國家是這樣，對於我們中國也一定應該這樣。</p>
<p>唯其我們這個國家不能不採取最迅速的方法來恢復民挨的活力，（這祗要適當應用有成效的現代科學方法就可以做到），因此，我在過去九星期中，把最近若干世代以來，嚴重地腐蝕我們政治的病根展示了出來。我或許過於率直了些，把若于傳統的痼疾，說得赤裸裸地全無隱諱；可是我所以明知故犯的這樣做，實因我覺得這是必要的，我們必先瞭解了自身最壞的缺點，然後可望除舊更新，獲得最完美的境地。</p>
<p>我希望能激動那些失職誤公的人們良心上的羞愧，使之痛革前非，不然就引咎吿退。我並且希望能感動一切正直的，純潔的，有意志有能力去檢討和改正民族缺點的愛國同胞，集中他們的眞誠熱力，來進行有力的改革，而重建我們的國家。</p>
<p>我這樣地責難着社會的各個部份，希望能播下全國　　的種子，使我們的知識階級都能通力合作，在行政經濟等各種事業中革除那些陳腐的，浪費的，毫無效率的舊方法，以及一切不良風氣和習慣，我並且抱着同樣的熱忱，渴望知識分于迅速採用已著成效的新方法，盡他們的智慧，忠誠與力量，開發我們所蘊藏的人力與物力，使抗日戰爭早日勝利，從這次犧牲了這許多同胞，這許多資財的戰爭洪爐裏，鎔鑄出一個新的中華民國來。</p>
<p>上面九篇文字，我的注意點，一大半集中於建設新中國的物質條件方面；在這最後一篇我要特別討論到全國精神革新的重要及其與復興民埃工作的關係。</p>
<p>關於精神革新，國防最高委員會已經於三月十二日，宣佈了全國國民精神總動員網領，勸導全目，一致實行、這個計劃把握了如何革除我所宣示的種種民族缺點的基本要點，努力發動我民埃精神的精粹，以　國家的需要、網領裏面，說明國民精神總動員的意接，爲：</p>
<p>「集結全國國民之精神，於簡單共同之目標，使全國國民對自身皆確立同一的救國道德，對國家皆堅定同一的建國信仰，而國民每一分子皆能根據同一的道德觀念，爲同一的信仰而奮鬥犧牲。」　在這個節要裏面，包含着我所要求大家實行的許多原則，現在已成立了一個國民精神總動員會，由委員長担任會長，來推廣實施這種運動，在實施方面，目的要鼓勵全國民衆，大家都活躍起來，竭盡全力來造成復與中國所不可或缺的民族生活和愛國精神。</p>
<p>這是千載羅逢的良機，要喚起一切有資格有學識的人們，爲國家作急劇的革新。誰若是不能利用這種機會有所貢獻，誰就是自己放棄了他們做國民的資格；那些意願照着這個綱領努力的，就一定能在抗戰勝利，建國成功的過程中作了切實的貢獻，一定可得到永久的安慰。</p>
<p>這種精神的振刷，能不能影響到整個民族，我們祗要把敵人在過去二十個月對華殘忍侵略中暴露給全世界的那種民族性格，略加研究，就可以明白了。以前，日本人所自誇的有兩種卓越的特點：一種是他們武士道敎育中所包涵的武士精神；一種是由於他們實業發達及軍備新頴所表示出來的物質進步。</p>
<p>在日本軍事領袖還沒有決定進行大際政策來侵略中國以前，世上一般與論都還接受日本人自己的估價，承認他們是有文明，有文化，和崇尙俠義的民族。同時，世界各國的人也無條件的承認這一個民族具有無可挫折的軍事力量。</p>
<p>後來日本强詞奪理的發動戰事，各國的人也深信他一定能得到很快的而無傷於人道的勝利；但是在短短幾個月之內，世界的公意已有了歷史上驚人的轉變。殘暴接着殘暴，全世界的基督徒看見日本官兵無惡不作，全多驚駭目瞪口呆了。中國軍隊所表現的英勇素質，中國民衆所表示與持續的抗戰决心，使日本軍人張皇失措，不能不撕他們文明和俠義的假面具。儘量發揮他們無正義無紀律的性格，不惜肆行這種種不法，不　不信實。不人道的獸行，以求達到他們的目的。</p>
<p>世界各國的人已經這樣的震該和驚詫了，但日本人却仍舊一個月接着一個月的權續他們違反人道的行爲，把他們以前理雜虛僞排塲所得來的一點聲譽丟得乾乾凈爭，因之他們的眞面目也一天天的更加暴露出來，顯出他們是一種無法無天的雜凑而野蠻的物質主義的產物。他們無理性地迷信「武力卽公理」，愚妄地把自己當作神明的子孫，對於不順從他們意志的人都認爲是地球上面應受掃蕩的渣滓。</p>
<p>他們這一種純粹的物質主義究竟對他們有甚麼好處，這要待將來的歷史來說明；但就目前已經揭露的事實來說，也可以成爲我們全國國民有利的敎訓。日本看着就快崩潰了，人類遺傳在上本來就有精神的質素，但日本六十年來都以全力從事於物質和軍力的發展，完全忽視了人民情神方面的陶冶，這就是他崩潰的原因。</p>
<p>這樣深刻的教訓和警戒，深深印在我們民族和個人的靈魂上，所以我們必須把我們祖先所有美德吸收到我們生命理面謹敬保持着，這些美德不僅使我們經過幾千百年還能夠生存下來，而且使我們這一個偉大辛勤而沒有武裝的民族，能夠克服種種最不人道的戰禍。</p>
<p>根據政府所宣佈的精神動員的計劃，我們要提高和充實我們自己的生活，便應當向昔這一條精神的精神大道勇往邁進：我們應該積極地，自信地，不屈不撓地實行這個計劃所規定的種種節目，我們應當把他發揚光大起來，同時儘可能地利用其他精神上寶貴的力量來扶助其完成。</p>
<p>處在現在這個時期，我們更應該把我們的國家在精神的基礎上重新建立起來，培育我們寶貴的文化傳統，健全而圓滿地建設起我們一切應有建設。我們中國的人民旣已經在精神方面動員起來從事建國的工作，我們一定能保全我們的民族和我們自己的生存權，我們不應當自餒，同時也不甩害怕別人，我們可以從那個富有感應性的拉丁字Resvrgam「我將再起」當中得到啟示，得到無限的安慰和榮譽，我們應　充分的利用這一種啟示完成我們民族的復興。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員記者：賡雅</p>
<p>從鄂北交通中心地——老河口，乘汽車北上南陽，可東駛平　路南段據點晏城，或北駛開海路據點洛陽；若沿漢水西去，南路可通漢中，北路可達長安。記者决取最後一路，卽先赴長安。</p>
<p>在老河口南門外太和旅社中一個「有實無名」的車站售票處，按登記手續買到一張臨時用墨水筆　個「全」字或「半」字的所繼車票，將開車時，旋被收去。手續草率，令人滋疑：第一，人數擁擠，超過定額；第二，軍人優待半票，據說限制五名；第三，——據說此路車是歸陝西建設廳經營，但無正式招牌文據所以大家猜想這椿生意，定是陝省建廳經營的腎牌貨。隔日行經商縣，須換乘陜省孤兒院汽車，弊端重重，將被澈查無疑。</p>
<p>縱是軍用汽家也有些自私自利的司機們，特別是由商辦車改爲軍用的司機，竟敢偷賣了汽油，以圖自肥；甚或與各油站辦事人勾結，謂油站無存油，另行備價貴買，以使浮報作弊。大焉者，如各地統制貨物的機關，也有人　營狗苟地想大發國難財，他們良心眞昧得下呀！可是古人說得好：「其悖入者其悖出」。平時吞公肥已的，還沒一人好下場，戰時捉混水魚的，當然更無種瓜得豆之理。</p>
<p>開車初行數十里，路面很壞——那天車開得太遲，司機拚命趕路，曾在豫境西硤口，翻車一次，該處幸非深阱，尙未釀成巨禍，晚抵西平鎭而宿。鎮有土城，人口相當稠密。以前無旅館，今春築路通車，飯舖生財有道，才用竹　隔室宿客；鄕人呼茶房「店小二」，而店小二隨喚隨應，古聲古樂，殊覺可笑。東北靑年軍人陳哲君，隔室談述戰物珍聞，涉及如何輸送生力軍赴×後活動的眞相，尤爲津津有味。</p>
<p>次日車經豫陝邊境，所見廢城頹緝，傳即三國時代，關羽過五關斬六將處。山勢險峻，河道灣曲，城郊曠野，呼嘯着軍隊野外演習的雄壯殺聲，由不得使你會興奮，會痛快，會有一種希望：萬一此間古戰場變成今戰場日，也就是他們假演習變成真勝利之時！</p>
<p>這一帶紅槍會的組織，也正在那里雲蒸震的地發展著。沿路見他們公開操演的姿態，與國述差不多，行列却參用新式軍操，皆別具一種風格。另有一種秘密操演，叫「寄刀」；據說寄刀寄得靈驗時，可在槍林彈雨中格殺不傷。寄刀須在深夜靜室舉行，那時萬賴俱寂，四大皆空，先向神堂焚香膜拜，嗣聽師傳符咒吩咐，立于就地所劃十字之上，便可不言不語，以手臂胸腹，袒承刀槍錄刃而不傷。寄刀法術，有所謂「黑三道」者，據可驗至時對時（卽廿四小時）；另有「紅三道」，可驗至一個月。期內可一鼓作氣，向×衝殺無碍。他們對外目稱「紅槍會」，掌管全會大權者稱「會長」，或「社長」；但對內則自稱「神團」，稱會長爲「團頭」，稱敎授武術者爲帥傳。每會人數，由數百集至數千數萬不等，但最大多數，都是精壯楧實的農民。會與會之間，互有聯絡，守望相助，出入相扶持。總之，他的組織和號召，雖然帶有迷信神權的色彩，但他們本是一種民衆自衛力量，一經各地縣政府和駐軍政工人員的宣導，便齊起參加在民族抗戰的大　下，把他們偉大的潜在勢力儘量貢獻出來。豫南皖北之紅槍會，以假降誘×聚　；晉南一條山的侯大師傳，率領衆，協助大徒軍，屢建襲×奇助——這都是紅槍會英勇抗戰「小試其鋒」的好榜機。</p>
<p>又豫陝鄂邊區，如紫荊關，南南，鄖西那一帶的崇山峻嶺，從前都是匪風極重的區域。自抗戰以來，曾先後被當局召　了二三千人，加以嚴密組訓，輸往×後活動。惟在陝西商　龍駒寨盤據五六年之久的著匪劉松林，聚匪徒八百餘人，抗不受命，也於記者行經商縣的前幾天，被該區專員溫良需氏率軍前往力動，苦戰五畫夜，將他們全部撲滅。故地方交通，已　安全。</p>
<p>這一帶人民掘居窰洞的方法，却非常險奇，他們在危崖削壁的裏層，挖掘居室堂屋，層層登登，曲徑通幽，可住數十戶，容納百人。全盤窰洞僅在山頂開個總門，或在底層留條通路，生人前彼問津，僅見壁窗層層間有汚水下瀉，往往不得其門而入。</p>
<p>他們這些高居危崖前壁，如大同　崗山和敦煌千佛山窰洞石佛似的居民，有時見機會可乘，也會幹洗刦路人的勾當的。因窰洞暗無天日，孔竅繁多，甚且還有貯糧水源，故屢次犯案，均不易着手搜捕。但將來也許好傲游擊隊的策源地哩。（未完）</p>

<p>正是雨季重來南國的時節。筆者應駐桂的國際友人之邀，偷間作陽朔的遊訪。</p>
<p>施政一斑</p>
<p>陽朔東濱　朋，西南北二面，都是層譽的情嶂。縣城爲山水所限面積恐尙不及四方里，人口只三百多家，除了三，六，九日的墟場以外，沒有商業可言。縣城以北十八里的白沙墟，東南的福利墟，東北三四十里的與平壚，包圍着它，這幾個墟市擁有比縣城多幾倍的人口，有着縣城所沒有的較熱鬧的街市，它們使縣城孤零起來，冷落起來。筆者和縣長朱謨，副縣長劉碧光晤談了幾次。他們保持着廣西口政官吏的樸實和誠懇，縣長，在過去，甚至在廣西以外的現在，還是「百里侯」，是所謂「父母官」，但朱縣長的月俸是桂幣一百五十元（法幣七十五元）。雖然每年在田賦收入中，有政府規定縣長可得百分之一的酬金，但他畢竟是一個縣長，有計多少不了的支出和應酬，因此他到現在還無法把湖北故鄉的眷屬迎來陽朔；現在縣政府每月辦公費僅二白元，單是燈油一項，就得費一百多元。使他必須限制蘇府點燈的時間，時常叮囑辦事員節省紙筆來平衡收支，由此看來，我相信他生活的淸苦。陽朔全縣，山多村少，是個貧瘠的四等縣份，每年經常及臨時的平衡收支約十二萬元，最大的收入是出賦附加，其餘，田畝附加和土產稅佔十分三，公產收入佔十分之一，行政費和敎育費各佔全支出十分之三。七，現有縣立中學一所，中心小學十四所。初級基礎小學一百六十餘所。據朱縣長說：全縣已沒有失學的學齡兒童，成人敎育也在積極推進。文盲已減到最少的數字，比較上，女性的文盲仍較男性為多。原因是廣西女子的操作時間較男子為長，至於僻處深山窮谷間的村婦。在推行和接受敎育的雙方面，更多不便，但槪括地來說：文盲也可說是肅淸了。全縣出征人共一千餘人。尚有三十歲以內的後備壯丁一萬七千餘人，四十歲以內的三萬人，都受過各鄉村長的督練，知道各種基本戰術，劉副縣長是日本士官學校的舉業生，頭髪已經花白，仍不失少壯軍人的氣概。我看見他冒雨在公共體育場對六個連的集訓，游擊隊講話。那些游擊隊員是由各村推派的。每村五人，他們自備槍枝，子彈，服裝，並且自備伙食，到縣裏來受一個月的游擊戰術訓練，然後再把所學得的帶回去，傳授給其他受過普通軍事訓練的社丁。當劉副縣長領着我參觀他們的宿舍時我覺得他們相處如同家人。最使我驚佩的，是陽朔縣現在已具備了若干處游擊戰的根據地，那些工事，便是在這兩位縣長指導之下，與民衆合作完成的。</p>
<p>訪宋哲元</p>
<p>過去，站在馬鞍山的谷口，可以望見水的西岸，有一大片蔗田和一家土製蔗糖的榨坊，現在蔗田的一部分被新的竹籬包圍了，在幾棵高高的棕樹下三間式的平房分散的在田土上建造起釆，那是「進德新邨」，陽朔每一位居民都知道那是宋上將哲元的別墅。走進　門，繞過一列屏風似的修竹，是小小的會堂，兩旁是傳達室和汽車間，路一　，就見一個掛着匣槍，握着二十九軍的署名大刀的侍衛，他把我的各片交給宋氏的秘書主任高子厚氏，而隨卽延見。宋氏自結束第一戰區副司令長官任務後，會在南獄休養若干時日，去年下半年，爲愛陽朔的山水，特在此購地建屋。現在正思輕性的半身不逐症，只能勉強在庭園裏散步。眷屬著護着他，代他婉謝釆訪的賓客。高主任是一個謹嚴的山東人，曾任察哈爾省政府秘書長等職，相談甚懷，他們居住北方久了的人，在這已連月不見日光的陽朔出中，潮濕的氣候使他們感到不慣，但晨夕徜徉山水，在戎馬倥偬之餘，却也不無淸趣。據高主任晚：「宋氏最近在陽朔就任軍事委員職，已電蔣委長誚假，一俟病體復原，卽赴渝到會辦事。這裏除宋夫人，男女公子和秘書辦事員若干人外，尙有衛隊六十餘人，宋氏有時也親臨講話，希望部下蔚為國用，宋氏現服中藥，預計再休養一月，當可復原。宋氏每晨八時起身，晚十時許休息，日常生活是寫字，讀經和散步。」新邨佔地約三十餘畝，購地所賣約一千餘元，宋氏雖不能長住陽朔但房屋構造仍極緊固，每　約費洋千餘元，將來他準備把這新邨交給縣政府作為地方的產業。宋氏今年五十六歲，在高主任送我出邨時。我警見他穿着便裝，握着手杖，和夫人女公子在院落裏閑談，氣色很好二宋氏對抗戰前途非常樂觀，他認吳佩孚決不會受人愚弄。</p>

<p>【美聯社匈京廿四日電】匈政府頃發表公報宣稱、匈軍進佔盧森尼亞與斯洛伐克交界之恩閣谷數處、目的在保護北通波蘭邊境之鐵道、該公報幷證實匈軍曾在期洛伐克境內與斯洛伐克軍隊、發生局部衝突、約一日之久、謂現已組織雙方混合委員會、進行解决、以决定永久國界</p>
<p>【美聯社匈京廿三日電】此間頃發表公報、答覆斯洛伐克之抗議、略稱、匈政府已允立卽進行調查、唯因斯洛伐克果境向無一定國界、是以當地兩軍確有發生局部衝突之可能、但有謂匈軍行動乃受德國慫恿、實屬無稽、</p>

<p>今日民衆社本港消息，暹維政府重征登記證費，僑胞被迫返國者日多，昨又有一批乘南美輪抵港，轉囘原籍。據談任選政府××下，僑胞生活，異常痛苦。</p>
<p>自從××法西斯勢力步步深入暹羅以來，暹羅政府年來對於華僑，卽曾迭頒種種××，不久以前並曾大捕華僑，這在海外僑胞，想必還有痛切的記憶。暹　政府此種爲××侵略者服役政策，不問其爲有意或無意，對我僑胞，固然受害不淺，但就華僑在暹歷史地位及其在經濟上的重要地位而言，則對於暹羅政府本身，亦多損害。</p>
<p>我們希望政府對暹政府迅作嚴正有力的交涉，使我旅暹僑胞合法的權利，不致冉遭蹂躪。同時更希望切實强化駐外使節，切實保護我僑胞在各地合法的生活與行動。</p>

<p>籌備已久的重慶哈密航空綫，已定於昨日正式飛行，倘如犬氣沒有變化，則交通部的「蘭州號」機可於今日飛到哈密，同時蘇聯飛機亦定昨日離阿拉麥杜飛到哈密。這是中蘇新航綫的首次通航。我們除了慶祝戰時交通上的新成功以外，應該認淸它在經濟上文化上的以至政治上的重大意義，所以我們又敢預期中蘇兩大民族今後更將親密合作，以共同反對遠東的××，奠定世界的和平。我們要盡九保障這條　的航空路綫，我們還要盡力發展地面上的新路綫！</p>
<h3 id="c41">舒斯特行記（續完） <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>對於大烏克蘭的前途，伏洛遜審愼地說：他們是正在作大規模的競賽，以求實現那一九一八年所作成的夢想。雖然這　想當時祗在數星期之內就幻滅了，希特勒的確曾經是他們的朋友，慕尼黑會議所確立下來的人種原則，是他們的憲章。但是他們並不想做德國的工具，英國本來也是以布爾希維克爲共同敵人的，爲什麼不能和他們做朋友呢？</p>
<p>青年在訓練中</p>
<p>如果總統是溫柔的，哲學的，那末在「西克」的集中營裏，我們就可以發見一種完全不相同的精神。在這裏有各級的孩子在受着烏克蘭歷史和文化的訓練，在可能範圍內，還敎他們使用軍事武器，每一種訓練方式都是充滿着活潑的軍事精神，當我們進去參觀的時候，在寄宿舍裏，一個大的麥包倉庫，上面蓋着顏色很可愛的花姆士本的毛布，少年們唱着不諧和的歌，開頭是依着納粹式的歌唱，但後來就很像是更好聽的烏克蘭贊美詩了。</p>
<p>據說有一萬二千人在按月分批訓練着，其中有二千人是在舒斯特的，有幾個少年，他們在集中營中構成了最堅忍，最勇敢的一部，都還帶着農民的習性。據我的嚮導者吿訴我說，他們是特別從東部邊陲招集來，專爲應付那萬一要到來的非常局面的。假如捷克政府，竟堅持着要任命捷克人到舒斯特政府來做行政長官的話，我的朋友說：「這樣的長官我們是絕對不容許的，我們不願受外國人的統治」。</p>
<p>「西克」的效忠於新的期望着的國家，是很熱烈的，蘇維埃烏克蘭壓迫民衆的故事，被講得有聲有色，但却並不詳靈，在事實上，我覺得要得到俄羅斯疆界以外所發生的事實眞相，簡直是不可能的，即使你用盡了方法，從波羅的克，從羅馬尼亞再三去探問。「西克」所仇恨的，並且在日益增加其仇恨的，是匈牙利人，波蘭人，和布爾希維克；對於那最後者，他們不但仇恨其『無上帝的共產主義』，更恨那在歷史上，俄羅斯人對他們長期的壓迫，他們也提到了麥粹伯。</p>
<p>我很抱歉，沒有多作勾留，卽取道往捷京。與其最相近的一個車站，距此約一百八十六英里，當然，那裏已有火車了，但波蘭人和匈牙利人把鐵道交通封鎖了，現在是用國有公共汽車來代替着，在我所乘的一輛公共汽車裏，乘客非常擁擠，大約有十五人坐着，八人立着。</p>
<p>在不良的地面上走了二十五英里之後，引擎卽已顯出難以繼續前進的樣子了，因此我們輪流下車等在路旁，車隨卽不見了。每次有貨車經過時、總有二三個旅客要求登車，我是不能够跟着他們去要求的，獨個兒望着，沒有一句俄羅斯話，斯洛伐克話，烏克蘭話幫助我、情景是很使我難堪的，最後總算有一輛貨車把我們最後留着的少數人，帶到了一個小鎭。</p>
<p>一次間斷的飽餐</p>
<p>我向其請求的那個站長，乾脆的拒絕了我，知道我是英國人，他把鼻子從那盛着肉和蕃薯的兩個鍋子上抬起來挺身而立，用很兇的姿態，並做着許多手勢向我說，我卽使站在那裏不走，他也不會伸出一個手指來帮助我的，他眞是太過份了。他所管理的鐵路，是給波蘭人和匈牙利人封鎖了，他只能使小摩托車在極短的距離內行駛着，他那有規律的生活是變成一團糟了。</p>
<p>我在大路上徘徊着，動間每一個人：「你會說德語嗎？」但是問了很久一個都沒有。此外，有一件惹人注意的事——　上的鼓手召集了許多人民去聽時事報吿。接着又碰到了一些好像是奇蹟的事。有人在囘答我的一句問話時，吿訴我說這鎭上有一個傳敎師，隨又指給我說：「就是他」。這樣我就遇到了麥格蘭，亞力山大，他是梭夫魯地方人，是來此救濟難民的。</p>
<p>我們共同坐一輛小汽車出發。車夫一心在做好生意，另外又給擠上了兩個旅客。一共坐了五個人，一會兒，又爲利慾所驅使，不能自己，竟又停了車招攬第六個人上來，他開着車門在守候。猛不防給一輛國有公井汽車開過把那開着的車門和踏脚板裂掉了，車的邊　也有一半給毀壞了。但這倒是一個極僥倖的機會，因爲這樣使那公共汽車停了下來，麥格蘭君婉言請求那車夫把我也帶上了軍。</p>
<p>從此，我們披荊斬棘的向着斯洛伐克的不蘭沙前進，我們時時在黑暗中下車以减輕車身的重量，使其能在較軟的路面上通過，或是引渡那陷於泥淖中的貨車，離開舒斯特十五小時之後，我到了不蘭沙。從百折不回的經驗中所得來的愉快，這時是完全消失了，因爲有一個日耳曼，斯洛伐克人，爲了取快於別的旅客起見，把一廳長而刻毒的關於維也納不公平裁判的演講，猛投到我身上來，他以爲這事英國人是要負責的，（之遣譯自十六日字林西報）</p>

<p>僑胞注意　勿輕南流</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>真光女中昨晚在青年會演出</p>
<p>【本報特寫】在「中國萬歲」的號召之下，靑年會的大禮堂擁擠着一大羣「中國萬歲一的愛慕者與追求者。</p>
<p>這次，眞光女中演出「中國萬歲」是爲着擴大救亡宣傳與提倡戲劇運動；因此，門票不收分文而讓各界自由索券參觀。在「深入的宣傳」與「戲劇大衆化」的迫切要求之下這是應該的。</p>
<p>昨晚七時，電光一閃，序幕就揭開，千餘對眼睛全都集中到舞台上面。寓有深刻意義的三幕國防劇，就在曲折的劇情上變化着，進行着。</p>
<p>佈景，燈光與化裝是相當考究的。只是第三幕的夜景，嘗一個時候黑晤得觀衆完全看不見，不知道這是有意的，還是無意的；總之，靜寂寂的秩序，亦破壞了一個頃刻間了。</p>
<p>每個演員的台詞是準備得很熟練的，個個亦很專心努力。美中不足的是，女子扮男角在外表上，言詞上，動作上，都是不像。有很多需要用力的地方，亦不够勁兒。這是一般女學校表演話劇難免的毛病；亦吿訴我們一個很淺顯的道理：男角應該男子扮演，女角應該女子扮得。戲劇原就是實生活的表現，裝的，假的，都不容易惟妙惟肖。</p>
<p>第一幕序幕的劇情沒有什麼特別的印象，第二幕革命團體在集體批判，共同計劃與×人奮鬥的時候，可就漸漸緊張起來，同時於戲劇宣傳之外，亦可以收到提倡集體主義的自我敎育的副作用。</p>
<p>第三幕與×人戰爭的塲而很緊張，可惜表現×××××還不够力量，不够逼眞，眞是太優待了×人了。要是男女合演的話，這一幕一定會有更大的收獲。最末，是我軍以壯烈的犧甡，換取了中華民族的自由解放。在××××××，我們偉大燦爛的國旗飄揚起來了！</p>
<p>——全體歡躍地肅立致敬！</p>
<p>雄壯動人的救亡歌曲聲送來賓魚貫離開會場。一顆感動着的心還是緊張地跳動！</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3 id="c54">香港婦女大團結聲中　婦女聯合工作回顧　群策群力地擴大婦女救亡工作吧！ <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>住在繁華奢靡的香港底華僑婦女，受着風氣的薰陶，獲得一個中外共曉的名兒——香港小姐。外來的朋友，都視這是一個談話資料的有趣人物。然而，七七蘆溝橋的戰炮，把她們從華現的　　轟了出來，參加著各種救亡的工作，貢出她們在祖國艱鉅的抗戰中應盡的責任，這證明了番　的婦女，不盡是單純　　得噗喝和妝飾的人，而一樣也可以做祖國女兒所能做底工作！</p>
<p>緊　着盧溝橋抗戰的序幕展開，中國婦女慰勞會香港分會便開始成立了，那裏的會員很多都是京滬僑居香港的知名婦女，和港中的婦女界領袖，會長是孫院畏夫人陳淑英女士，主席是宋子文夫人張樂怡女士。跟着譚世藩夫人劉慶萱女士等主持的中國婦女兵災籌賑會，和吳鐵城夫人馬鳳歧女士等主持的廣東省新生活運動促進會婦女工作委員會香港分會，和其他的婦女救亡團體，亦都次第的組繳起來，積極參加救亡工作，這眞是香港婦女的一種光輝。由於社會人士對婦女救亡團體冀望的熱烈，大家都進一步的要求她們能够迅速的團結起來，以收更宏大工作的實効；——但結果這個提議因爲環境的阻隔，沒有實現。</p>
<p>隔了不久，婦女慰勞會，婦女兵災會，婦女新運會，女靑年會，四個婦救亡團體，因爲工作的需要，便聯結起來，組成了四婦女聯會，定每兩星期開聯席會議一次，以交換大家的意見、使能夠盡分工合作的效能。在第一次的聯席會議當中，何香凝女士會列席參加，提出了提倡國貨，訓練幹部，和積極推進婦女勞工識字運動的三個當前急不容緩解决問題。後來倡用國貨團的組成，和國貨展覽會的舉辦，四婦女宣傳訓練班的成立，和其他種種有意義的工作，都可以說是從這個會孕育出來的。</p>
<p>廿六年的雙十節，在嘉路連山南華球場舉行紀念，參加這個紀念典禮的有廿幾個團體，卅幾家學校，熱鬧極了。跟着紀念廿七年的三八婦女節和三一二總理逝世紀念大會，都有很好的成績，這統是由婦女四聯會主幹推動的工作。</p>
<p>緊隨着戰事的開展，中國婦女慰勞自衛抗戰將士總會戰時兒童保育會在漢成立，收容一切將士遺孤，和戰區裏無親無靠的流浪兒，各地分會，紛紛成立，總會便派了何香凝女干，王孝英女士　胡木蘭女士協同婦女，聯會，開始籌備杳港的分會，五月中旬，便吿籌備成熱，保育的工作，便漸漸的開展着，先後成立了元朗第一院，和第二分院，第三分院，收容了從轟炸火焰中逃出來的廣州難童，和漢口的難童難嬰等，現在保育院的新院址已在趕緊興築中，大概不久便可以落成，將來還可以繼續收容戰區的難童保存國脈。替新中國訓練初鬥士，這對祖國該是一個殊動啊！</p>
<p>在去年五月間×人瘋狂的轟作廣州民居，瘋狂的轟炸我粵漢廣九各交通線，市民曝屍十里，廬舍殷墟，其餘未遭毒手的，都紛紛逃到四鄕，或輾轉來港，裙帶道上，流靡失所的難民，相屬於道。於是四婦女聯會又聯合全港各界團體推動組織了香港各界賑濟華南難民聯席會，救濟華南廣州各地的難民，特別是廣東遭×機轟炸而遭禍的各屬，受惠最多。其躲接濟各救傷隊服務團的醫藥物品，也不算少數。還有去年的七七抗戰建國紀念日，舉行了素食內賣　運動；八一三淞滬抗戰紀念日舉行了献金運動；小販的義賣獻金，也在這時　育起來。這一運動轟動了全國，熱烈極了，　着還有廿七年的　　節贈旗大運動，這些都楚彰人耳目的有意義的工作。而在這些工作中，婦女團體所出的力量是不少的。</p>
<p>這時，在戰事方面，×人是銳攻南潯線，這方面戰綫的主帥，有很多是我粵中的驍將，爲了慰勞前綫浴血抗戰的將士，加强他們的戰鬥能力，四婦女聯會又推動組織了全港婦女北上慰勞團。參加這個負有神聖使命的慰勞團的，有學生，有閨秀小，姐，有學校的校長，甚至太太也穿起了黑的膠鞋背起銅鼓帽同黃沙滾滾的大道行進着，這是多麼令人興奮的一件事！慰勞團到了戰地，發揮了很大的作用，使我的將士全感動得鼓舞起來，第二天便馬上打了一個勝仗。而且還鼓動了其餘各地的婦女團體到前線慰勞去，這實在香港婦女値得嬌傲的一件工作啊！</p>
<p>上面這一切一切的神聖工作，都是香港的婦女團結起來的良好的表現，由這點可以證明到，祗要團結，無論怎樣艱難困苦的工作，都可以迎刃而解的。自然、在這當中，一切相反的現象，像傾軋和磨　，仍然是免不了的，但以香港婦女在初次的團結，在破天荒的合作上，而獲得了這麼樣的成績。這已經是很難得的了。不過我們也不要太過分的樂觀，我們的工作，還是非常的不够的，還有其他很多工作，都是急待婦女門去做的。因此，在香港的婦女救亡觀體，就有進一步合作的必要，所以在三八婦女節的大會當中，何香凝女士卽席提議組織了香港婦女團體聯合大會，同時宋慶齡女士對婦女的團結也有很深切的企望。</p>
<p>在抗戰更轉入了一個艱困的階段的今天，香港的婦女團體，實在不應該再事猶豫徘徊，應該趕速手握牢着手，加緊負起各種未了的工作，更加發揚僑港婦女的精神，前兩天三八節的結束會當中，香淮婦女聯合大會這個提議包獲得了大家熱切的擁護，我們翹企以待這個聯合大會，能够發揮着更宏大的工作効能！</p>
<p>最後我們用至　的熱誠來貢獻一站意見：第一，我們的團結，是貫澈始終的，不是五分　熱度的團結；第二，無論過去有甚麼私見有甚麼裂痕，都應該在團結工作中迅速的泯除；第三，在精誠團結中羣策羣力地擴大工作的效能。能够做到這麼樣，香港婦女聯會前途的發展，是沒有限量的啊！</p>

<p>晚服…三十五元</p>
<p>化粧盒…八元</p>
<p>她們笑我的化粧盒買貴了、這是一个綠色小鐵盒、像个釣魚用的盒子似的、其中一个女子向我解釋它頂多只値兩塊錢、然而那件晚服、她們沒有話可說、它是很漂亮的、我覺得這件衣服把我和故鄉更隔遠了一層、</p>
<p>一月過去、有一天、我估量一下目下的情形、有點焦急起來了、</p>
<p>在影人衆集之處等候機會的結果、花費大而毫無成就、一點影子也沒有、在那些著名飯店內用餐、最少要一塊錢、小賬在外、又是一筆大開支、因爲人人付小賬都很够派頭似的、我每星期大約總要去三次、又到加賽大戲院去參加過一次新片獻映、五塊錢的鬥票、兩塊錢一朶花、結果也並不爲人注意到、我遍訪演員介紹所、看過八位代理人、他們都因爲我無經騐而拒絕、寫過十五封辭意懇切的信給十五位導演（石沉大海）、在各个戲院門口、公司門前、旅館內、飯店裏、所有的公共塲所憇息、或立或坐、向同寓的女子們請敎、一有新片開始攝製、我就跑到公司裏設法、我在路上攔截過導演、和素不相識而看上去像是重要的人物說話——這些似乎祗使我成爲一個顯著的可憐可厭的人、無論什麼地方所遇著的總是一個有禮貌堅决的拒絕、好萊塢的人是很忙很忙的、而我、又不比嘉寶、瓊克勞馥、金述羅吉絲、瑙瑪希拉等人更有什麼特長之處、只是好多萬人中的一个、很平凡的一个而已、</p>
<p>每一件瑣碎的事都使我的希望更爲渺茫、公寓裏也是變化無窮、今天這位女子有了很大的希望，明天又換了旁人、「愛股絲的成績不好……、瑪麗囘去跟她隔壁的男朋友結婚去了……琴候了六個月才弄到一個鏡頭試驗、可是又失敗了、……蓓蒂的東西都典當光了……」</p>
<p>我呢、整整一個月的努力、少了二百四十六元五角五分、</p>
<p>第二月的頭兩天、平靜無事、第三天上有一個輕微地震、碎了幾塊玻璃窗、倒場了幾個烟突、這一點小事到了愛造謠生事的報紙上便鬧得天下皆知、我連忙打了一個長途電話回家、吿訴他們我沒有事、免得他們哭哭啼啼趕來在傾圮的潰址找我的屍體、這機一個電話、四元五角、</p>
<p>第五天、汽車第一次付欵期到了、我付了二十元、而汽車公司祖保車子不出毛病的期限也滿了、好像車子故意跟我搗亂似的、第二天它就出了毛病、汽車公司不負責了、又該自己花錢修理、這一下子又是四元六角三分、</p>
<p>痛痛快快的哭了一場之後、又費三塊錢買了一點襪子、情形似乎好轉了、同寓的薇雲約我和她及她一位女友（她是某演員指導的朋友）同餐、這是個太好的機會、我當然去了、幸而那一位似乎對我很表示好感、幷且接受了下一日我做東請吃飯的邀請、第二天在比趣康白又花了我五元、可是這倒還値得、她到底答應把我介紹給那位演員指導呢、</p>
<p>這一位也還喜歡我，帶我吃飯、把我介紹給一個製的片人女秘書、她帶我看了一次預映、又爲我介紹了一位助理導演、介紹來介紹去、最後、總算有了點指望了、可是錢眞花了不少、午膳、晚餐、鷄尾酒、然而這是有利的、我從不輕輕放過我的貴客（也許是犧牲者）、每次我都巧妙的暗示了我的希望、「我要一個鏡頭試驗」、</p>
<p>一天這位助理導演聽我說的次數太多了、鬧得頭痛起來、他建議我應該先加入一個小劇院去演戲、他說、「尋演員的人常常在那裏、只要你出色一點、他們就來找你了、爲了你、我允許你弄一個導演上那兒去看你演」，</p>
<p>於是我開始找這一類的小劇場、碰了不少釘子、看來足足有好幾百人同時在找像我所要的工作似的、我看出來了、眞正出錢僱演員演戲的劇場是佔極少數、其餘大部是靠着作家的津貼而惟持的、這些人付了錢讓他們的脚本在該院上演、也有未成名的導演花了錢導演、或是無名演員們花錢演戲、一句話、他們的目的祗在引起注意而已、</p>
<p>我也付了二十五元出去、好在一個世界上最壞的歌劇裏、一個世界上最壞的導演之下、一羣支配得最糟妳演員裏、獲得一個角色、三星期的練習中、那位導演先生連舞台的左右都鬧不淸楚、而那位男主角呢、由於過度的「努力」、在一個戀愛場面裏幾乎扭折了我的頸骨、</p>
<p>除了上面說過的二十五元外、這次還花了不少錢、我租了一個黑而長的假髮、一套草裙和花環、</p>
<p>好景不長、在正式預演的那天下午、那位助理導演打了個電話來、說是那位導演上聖他巴巴拉拍攝外景去了、要兩星期後才能囘來、然而我們的戲只演一星期、糟透了、白費心思、</p>
<p>上演的成績也糟極、我在那本惡劣的戲裏演了七晚、每晚的觀衆鄱很可疑、大約不是演員的親威就是有別種關係的人、反正不是外人就是了、饒是這樣、他們看了一慕之後、不約而同的　有點不甚滿意的表示、七天過後、我吿退、花一天工夫來考慮一下虛境、</p>
<p>我祗賸七十五元了、智囊也空了、好萊塢名不虛傳、究竟不易是破關而入的、尤其是像我這機的人、我漸漸生了憎惡好萊塢的心、</p>
<p>到了我袋中除囘去的車票外祗多一元錢時、公寓主婦來叫我聽電話、她說話的聲音沒有一點特別可使我興奮之處、然而我的腿發了抖、心房也跳動不已、、又是他、那位助理導演、</p>
<p>「喂、你是不是…你就是曾向我要一個鏡頭試騐的罷…你還在這兒…喂、喂、…我當我找不到你了、我把你的相片給老板看過了、他要見見你、你二十分鐘裏能來嗎、帶那件黑的晚服來、…你趕得上嗎…喂、…」</p>
<p>凑巧車胎又破了一個、要到公司去就要呌汽車、大約總要三元左右、這意思是說要上公司去就要動用買車票的錢、這不啻是切斷了自已和家裏的生命綫、那末坐這次汽車是含着嚴重的賭博性質在、在我之先、有過幾十次鏡頭試騐的女子現在還在等着「再來一次」的機會、何况我這次纔是第一次呢</p>
<p>我究竟叫了汽車沒有呢、</p>
<p>猜猜看、</p>

<p>（本報專訊）凡關心球事者。連日皆舉南華南與九龍會之戰為談論、蓋以南南跨海北征、戰地不利、稍有差池、便成　事、故成對南南有患得患失之心、深恐其降龍乏衛、</p>
<p>九龍不出洞、一若地頭蛇、其威可畏、遇之失色、抑亦不知己有若干勁旋、前後牲於其爪牙之下、而視其球場　畏途、卽以南南之强、前次作特別艮牌複賽於是、亦無以制勝、祗成和局、後　離其球場而乃淘汰之、則地利問題之關係重要、此可知矣、</p>
<p>今日以主場不敗之頑師、迎奪標呼聲最高之客軍、一憑地利優勢、雖云株守、亦欲振雄風、一以技巧見長、如波此關、　前途似錦、故此爭必烈、定無廢矣、</p>
<p>九龍所爭者、乃欲保持主場不敗之紀錄、南南所爭者則爲光榮燦爛之冠軍之故爭之意義雖不同、惟勝利目的則一也、</p>
<p>記者鑑於前週銀牌準决賽南南雨中行軍、竟能大破東方、由當時所見之事實、南南各員皆能運用其眞本領、不爲環境所支配、　今日彼等亦具有此種精神、　以爲制勝殊非難　、尤望今日之天氣、一如戰東方時之乍晴乍雨、則取勝更有把握也、</p>
<p>論及天氣問題、或有怪吾言之不倫、蓋多數人以南南擅長短傳術、若雨中作戰、實感不宜、何得謂爲有利、豈予獨具高見耶、</p>
<p>吾今所指、乃單爲雨中在九龍球場作戰而言、緣九龍所恃者地利也、若今日天下乍雨、則塲濕球重、彼等慣習之步驟、必失其常態、而無地利可言、反之、南南各員因富於經騐、對球控制有方、雖雨而不甚受影嚮、故吾之作如是想、乃因時制宣之翻耳、</p>
<p>錦標在望、再進卽達望、南南諸子、好目爲之、若今日破此頑旅、則盟主一席、非彼將莫敢居矣、</p>
<p>東方對米社息一役、亦關係重要、如東方得勝、亞軍有望、而再看南南與海軍此後得失如何、則可從中取利矣　南南九龍兩陣如下、</p>

<p>— 賴端南</p>
<p>不佞從事於體　寫作者幾二十年、所見劇烈警事亦不渺、乃從未見足球賽事之緊張有如本屆者。更令人興奮厥爲不獨本港足球華人與西人有極劇烈之爭奪戰、聯賽勢成拉鋸式、卽上海亦有麗都以聯賽中丙組足球隊而獲史高托盃之成績、又本港籃球聯賽、聲勢赫絕一時之星島隊、乃突喪師於鐘聲之手、此後勢將成爲破天荒之爭奪奇觀、歟盛哉、嘆觀止笑、</p>
<p>其次、年來香港足球、乃屢開空前朱有之奇觀、哥靈登到後、西貢隊又隨來、入本年、菲律濱又來作破天荒之港菲觀際賽、事隔未久、星洲中華協進會隊亦就來臨、同時、又有麗都擬五月初征港之訊、萬千球迷、此後當如入山陰道上、目不暇結矣、</p>
<p>提倡體育、非財不行、本港體育之在遠東、發揚最早、尤以賽足球之熱鬧情形爲甚、乃足球總會雖有數十年歷史、至今尙時感財政缺乏、實憾事也、不謂是年因李球怪復出、港菲之賽、因其叫助力大、第一場收入逾八千元、三場收入餘萬金、今更平添似將實現之東方對海軍之亞軍决賽、足球總會藉此或將　此賽三份一之收入、又南華南在聯賽之突敗於警察、定復平添特別銀牌决賽會之收入不少、足球總會盈餘高漲、香港足球其因是更與盛矣乎、</p>
<p>李惠堂致桑榆函、謂後浪不推前浪、遂令「過氣老倌」、相形中猶自高出一切、實感慨之言、非自謀吹噓也、觀於今之後起球人、或有一技之長、卽夜卽自大、或則一經報紙頌揚、即不可一世、此後卽着意於盤赤、若更顯耀其抱負於人前者、由此一念之差、乃再無進步、反覺頹唐、此最不良之現象也、人遂有咎我輩不應過事讚揚者、惟是我輩職責、在於推進、不有應貶、球員雖有自知之明、將曷從而求改善、何况不褒而多貶、則好勝者且仇我無、貶而得其正、人且仇我而盛加以無理之質問、吾人雖不以爲意、然執筆者難也、但望一輩後生、必謀後浪必能推前浪之法、不斤斤於一時之虛譽、則吾國體育、庶幾有賴乎、</p>
<p>在一星期前、有以爲足球隊因劇爭之下不能無猜忌、由此椎測、以爲東方戰海軍時未必出全力以赴、又南華南穩得冠軍後、戰海軍亦未必求穩勝、此不啻杞人憂天也、今者事實吿我、東方諸將戰海軍、而傷將盡出、以是終勝、南南又適新敗於警察、對海軍不能不力求勝利、猜忌之說已不攻自破、華人冠亞軍幷取之榮已在望、可喜屬甚、</p>
<p>置諸死地而後生、乃用兵秘訣也、南南每有輕敵之弊、冥冥中乃仍有故弄狡獪、必使意外負於警察、使力求自力更生者、然則南南最近之一敗、直南南之福也、變料冠軍以至三　冠軍之獲得（聯賽、特別銀牌、旭和盃）、二種因其在界限街場之一敗無乎、</p>
<p>籃球聯賽、歷年無新東代謝之演出、香港此項技術水準以是而莫可超　、今則曾敗於南華之鐘聲、乃突然擊敗多屆冠軍隊變相之星島、則星島後此必未敢輕視南華、况尙有强力之東方、培英、足予以極大威脅、其他如華南、如警察、皆非易與者、荊棘滿途、則星島隊之訓練也必加勤、賽時當更無復敢輕敵、只此一點、已足徵未來之事、賽必劇烈、如是則香港籃球水準之提高、其在斯乎、其在斯乎、若再進而謀更完善之管理組織、吾知以我「廣東精神」必非久居人下者也、</p>
<p>網球自徐煒培突起後、卽無復有繼興者、於是冠軍之爭、又復如前之幾於不賽已前定、一入第三週賽、觀者卽無復新面孔可見、大有十餘年如一日之慨、非網球界之福也、今年似略有生氣、吿山奴與丁丁雷米迪之勝　惠釗與前查於雙打、大學醫科預料生林添德之專入第三週、蔡永善之險勝大林珍李惠堂姚德卓之惡戰林珍兄、弟、均不可多得之新精神仇、然而　軍能有易主之可能否乎、徐潤培之藝已有壓倒迺兄之學歷否、仍是絕大疑問、大徐因無遊歷機會、雖有天賦才能而未能發展及於國際水準、潤培年少有爲亦危於同一命運、吾甚惜之、安得我倖中馬彩之願終　、自資遣如徐氏兄弟者求藝於國外以榮祖國也、我國富人不少、何無一具同我心腸嘆、可者可嘆、</p>

<h3 id="c73">由砲兵及工程欲參加來屆甲組聯賽　說到陞級與降級問題 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】記得一九三五至三六年度的足球季、參加甲組聯賽的突創一個新紀錄、共有十三隊之多、因而賽程延長、由一九三五年九月中旬開始、至一九三六年五月中旬方行結束、</p>
<p>足球乃劇烈運動、實不宜於夏天舉行、故英國足球總會曾有規定、每一屆賽會必須在五月份第一個星期內結束、本港足球總會舉辦賽會的一切章程細則、都以英國總會所訂　實行的爲根據、所以在一九三六至三七年度的足球季尙木開始前、爲使是屆賽會的日程不致延長起見、遂有必須在五月份第一個星期內結束的决議、復限制　加甲組聯賽的不得超過十二隊、此例至今仍執行、</p>
<p>最近兩屆　參加甲組聯賽的隊數均木超過限額、惟來屆如何、則未可知、蓋記者昨天探得　息、本屆在乙組聯賽中頗著成績的五營砲兵隊及廿四營砲兵隊、打算下屆聯合起來、以砲兵隊名義參加甲組聯賽的意思、而西工程隊亦有此種念頭、但向總會請　時、未悉向否邀准、</p>
<p>又記得總會在　决議限制參加甲組聯賽的不得超過十二隊的時候、曾附帶訂一條文、凡一乙組隊在比賽過程中得　優良成績的、如欲陞級、總會得體察情形、予以機會、　參加甲組的隊數旣有限額、若又接納一乙組强隊陞級　致超出十二隊之數、將取如何辦法呢、難道把訂定的限例推翻嗎、倘若眞箇遇有此種情形的時候、總會固有權接納一乙組強隊陞級、亦有權把甲組聯賽中那成績低劣的一隊降級、故來屆如果總會准許炮兵隊及四工程隊晉陞甲組、則是屆甲組的殿軍與及成績不好的、恐怕要降級　、</p>
<p>然而、是　甲組的殿軍、　然無疑的乃香港　隊、該隊在本港足球史上、佔有相當地位、復有「足球紳士」之稱、現任總會主席舉　、就是該隊內部的主要人　、雖然是屆該隊成績極壞、惟素有體面、若果總會在來屆要執行那成績低劣的一隊則降級的定例而施諸於該隊、相信必無成效、至居於殿軍前一位的聖約瑟隊、雖則成績不佳、俱該隊人材尙好、多數是國際賽的葡萄牙隊的代表、葡隊則獲决賽權、有此一事、斷無將聖隊降級的理由、因而來屆炮兵隊及西工程隊可否陞級、頗成問題、</p>
<p>依我意見、目下本港的足球運動、已相當發達、在理、總會對參加甲組的隊數、似不宜限制過嚴、額定十四隊、尙不爲多、蓋總會所以設立、乃捉倡足球爲宗旨、便應該扶叻球人向技術之途邁進、沒理由加以壓　的、若果總會覺得賽會的日程過於延長爲不適宜、則不妨把賽會提早一點開始、但未　總會諸公、亦以我言爲然否、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3 id="c80">文章與人格 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 皋皋</p>
<p>秦槍嚴嵩犯了　害忠良禍國殃民之罪，連坐到珠玉似的文章，處以極刑，不能「藏之名山，傳之後世。」周作人在北平，行爲上頗有漢好之嫌，上海好多中等學校，把他的作品從國文課本中剔出，雖然他的人格，尙水到得「論定」的時期。</p>
<p>使「君子不以人廢言』之說而可信，我很替古今人叫屈，就文論文，秦檢嚴嵩的大作「我不得而見之矣！』周作人的文章，在我個人一向存有「高山仰止」之心，至今，還很盼望他能以有力的事實，證明他的純潔的人格。</p>
<p>因行爲的乖戾，人格的卑汚，而連坐到文章，一般人的見解，以爲是一種膺懲，絕沒了他的神精上的財產，使他受有更深刻的苦痛，不論爲死爲生？何時，也寓有殺鷄給猢猻看的意味，使能文之士，不敢步武他的後塵。</p>
<p>其實不然，藝術離不開人生，作品　託於人格。繪畫，雕刻，音樂，無不如此，文學尤爲明顯。必也存於中，才能形於外：必也具有『不忍人」之心，才能寫出天地間的至文。韓愈說：「夫所謂文者，必有諸其中，是故，君子愼實，實之美惡，其發也不掩」。托爾斯泰直以藝術非「爲人生」不可，或更不限於藝術。他說：「一切信實的職業的前提條件，不是對工作，愛，乃是對人類不得不愛。這工作在改善人類的信念之下對於工作非愛不可。惟這樣充實愛念者，乃得爲有價値的工作。」你想，只這一般愷悌慈祥之氣，忠貞熱烈之忱已足以照耀千古；而况副之以敏銳的眼光，超時代的見解，文藝上的技巧，發爲文章，自然有不可思議的力量。憑這力量，引起人類的共鳴；憑這力量，推動政治法律道德思想的改革；憑這力量，普救芸芸衆生於水深火熱之中。托爾斯泰之所以爲托爾斯泰者在此，同樣，高爾基之所以爲高爾基，羅曼羅蘭之所以爲羅曼羅蘭，孔丘之所以爲孔丘，墨翟之所以爲墨翟，韓愈之所以爲韓愈……也是在此，然後，知立言必基於立德。「藏之名山，傳之後世，」非可倖而致者。</p>
<p>藝術上最忌的是虛僞的表現、自己本不喝酒，偏要奏上幾首對酒，野飲醉後　懷的　歌，自己本極熱中，偏要彈盟驚訪漁樵的高調，自己胸腔裏滿是私慾邪念偏要說担道義拯萬民等門面話，「修詞不立其誠」，那裏會有好文章呢，即使「著作等身」，也不過宇宙間暫時添加了許多魚目，許多粗製品，並不是珠玉，决不能傳後。</p>
<p>卽使他的寫作技巧，十分高明，可以掩盡天下人之目；但他的虛僞的人生，遲早總有被人揭破的一日，尤其在「歲寒」的當兒。一經揭破，則「言不由衷」的文章，「洛　紙貴」的一剎那過去了，依然不値半文，供人作廢紙而已。戲台上扮演的岳飛，無論神似到如何極點，總不能指爲民族英雄</p>
<p>吾深望有志於文藝的靑年們，除致力於技巧的修鍊外，更致力於偉大的人格充實的人生的修養。以愷悌慈祥之氣，忠貞熱烈之忱，寫出至情至性之文，爲不虛此生的自己，爲抗戰建國的中華民族！</p>
<h3 id="c81">「書生有用論」 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>『百無一用是書生，』文化人的『無用，』可見不是現在如此。『人生識字胡塗始，』因此，『字』實在「識」不得，道是「百無一用是書生」的明確的註解。「胡塗」人的「百無一用，」這是誰都曉得的。</p>
<p>現在是抗戰的時候，『投筆從戎！』是爲大家所敬佩，這可見『筆杆子』究竟是不及『槍杆子』的又一個明證。因此有些人對『文化人』在報章雜誌上大發議論、不禁輕視曰：『有種氣到前綫去，住在後方嘮嘮叨叨，這是口頭抗戰，這是文化人的墮落！』因此『書生』仍是「百無一用，」不過語氣是改變過來了。</p>
<p>然而「書生」果眞是「無用」麼？我說是「是的，」也是「不是的。」這話不是矛盾了麼？其實世界萬物。都是矛盾的。有其「善」的一面，必也有其『惡』的一面。『書生』有『無用』的，然而不能抺殺，也有「有用」的。否則，魯迅先生好好在學醫生，爲什麼要棄醫而從事於文藝的工作呢？單以我手頭間的一本巧爾尼雪夫斯基的小　「伺爲」，據說是十九世紀舊　時代靑　女的一個「天啓」。這只是在文藝一方面，其他如社會科學，亦莫不爲然。</p>
<p>抹殺文化人的無用，輕視「筆杆子」而重視「槍杆子，」這種人可說是只生了一隻眼睛，而對世界萬物，也只看見了一面，實有糾正的必要。</p>
<p>其實，文化人也有無用一的，在他的筆底下，所寫出來的，非　與國家社會無益，而反而有害，這可說是超過「無用」之上了。還有一種『書獃子，』捧着書本子死讀，咬文嚼子，一派「書生氣。」『人生識字胡塗始，』這句話來給他們，實在是再得當也沒有的了。因爲這種人，只見書本子上的『敎條』而不見書本子之外的動亂的世界，把『敎條』來衡量動亂的世界，因此他的眼睛模糊起來了，覺得實在有點『胡塗。』冬洪先生從孔孟的學說上來看現代的婦女，他一定會『胡塗』也一定會『憂患始，』不覺要搖頭嘆息：『世道日下』了。</p>
<p>像那樣的『文化人』，可說是「百無一用的」了。而抗戰對於那樣的「文化人，」我想是不必從他們那邊去求得一點什麼幫助的，然而，這只是「惡」的一方面，而從這「惡」的一方面去抹殺一切文化人的戰鬥性，這要不是『無知，』那末就是帶有點『惡意』了，</p>
<p>本月十五日的桂林電訊：說西南行營主任白崇禧將軍，十四日招待文化界，席間發表演說，大意謂：「此次對日戰爭，其性質爲抗戰，爲應戰，吾人處於次殖民地地位，其爭勝方法，端賴全體性戰爭，在政治經濟文化各方面與×奮鬥，文化人的工作，雖偏在後方，然其有助抗戰，决不亞於前万流血壯士。」文化人的「有用性」是從白將軍那裏可說是得到一個明證了。白將軍又指出，二期抗戰，我方在軍事方面取守勢，而在政治方面取攻勢。因此，這裏顯示出，文化人的筆杆子在健全國民的精神方面，可說是一種最爲優良的武器了。</p>
<p>我們不做「百無一用」的「醫生」，我們也不爲識得字而「胡塗，」我們不聽人家的「妄言」我們　起我們的「筆杆子，」要發揮出我們的戰鬥的精神來，總之，我們是不亞於前方流血的壯十的「文化人！」</p>
<h3 id="c82">歌唱的行列 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 黃乘生</p>
<p>這裏，我不常聽到孩子的歌聲。</p>
<p>孩子的歌聲是有的：然而沒有韻律，沒有節拍，沒有能够激起我的共鳴，我就像沒有聽到一樣了，他們往往祗是單個的兩三個的在路上哼兩句；他們不一定是學生吧？我看見通好幾次是　鞋　。沒有人給他們　練，哼兩句也還是從模仿自學得來的。自然，這對於他們是憤快的表露。——大槪是已從哀求式的替人服役，換取了一天生活的憑依。</p>
<p>我不常聽孩子的歌聲，但我的腦袋裏，却偶然會燙着孩子的悠揚歌聲的震響。</p>
<p>三個月前的鄕居、我遇到一個榮耀的節日，鄕村裏的夜空似乎光亮得特別早，醒過來，時鐘響了四下，祠堂裏的空氣已很淸新而且似乎帶了明凈，附近的一間小學，傳來了「我的×人兇似狼，侵佔我地方」的吼叫，在靜默的空間，歌聲顯得特別的爽快而嘹亮，在四邊的曠野裏，激起了美妙的回饗，外邊那野間離離欲墜的金莢的稻實，一定沐浴在晚秋的凉風裏，沐浴在歌唱的音波裏；凉風和歌聲，像雙飛的胡蝶，飛遍了金黃氈子的田間。離離黍稷也起着動人的旋舞了吧？</p>
<p>鄕村孩子。在都市人們正在甜睡的時分，就起來轉動他們的歌喉，這一天是大中華的最榮耀的節日，孩子們激跳了熱洪烘的心，要用凌晨的吼叫，表示他們對於祖國，對於鄕邦的熱愛，歌聲是愈高吭，念有柔然的頓挫了；聽得出還有大人在導唱，也許還執着一枝小捧在打拍節，在指揮吧，然而沒有伴奏的琴音，鄕村的小學是窮困的，買不起風琴，更不要說什麼「披亞勞」了。祗是這有什麼關係，一字一句淸楚地齊一地在震盪着，成了小小的韵律的浪潮，有時是奔騰着，是雷鳴，有時是潜然的低沈下去，是　流到遠遠的那方。誰說鄉村孩子是笨呆的！</p>
<p>我起來了，我的朋友也起來了，我們披了睡衣走出祠堂，深深地呼吸了「晨氣」。——那衹好叫做「晨氣」的，消新是淸新，却幷不柔和，要向你的鼻孔裏侵襲，微風吹皺了面前的池水，遠處還是迷濛的霧氣，看不見那對面的有名的百足山，歌聲像要永不停止，這回是不特在這邊的小　裏　層着，那邊隱隱約約有韵律的音波傳來，翹首遠望，那一方分明有一點微微的火光在轉動着，是個小小的　　吧？那一方却分明是一個畏樣的　籠了：不祗有燈籠，還有一列矮小的黑影在蠕動，又是孩子啊，他們從各方面來了。</p>
<p>我們跨過村門，仔細地踏着泥路：露水未乾；滑油油的，我記起我們該帶一枝手電：但我的朋友却堅持着要就這樣走過去，說縱然滑倒了，也常爲這一個節日中的不能忘的紀念，懷了奇異和喜悅，於是我們終於到了一座橋頭，面前便展開了一幅絕美的圖畫，東方的天空有點微明的意思了，四五條田間的小徑上，孩子列了單行的隊伍，在頭的一個提了燈籠在領導，禾稻高大，他們的身子矮小，祗露出半截腰身，在金黃的稻草中蜿挺地向前來，聽得出那唱着保衛中華，那唱着大衆的歌手，那唱着全國總動員，那又唱他們最熟習的「我的敵人兇似狼」，最妙的，那裏多是石板路吧，除了歌聲，還能聽到孩子們的屐響，忒忒撻撻，就像檀板的擊拍。</p>
<p>我們也不知道，「幾路大軍」　向我們這裏來，我們還披着　衣，不大成樣子——，他們是那樣莊嚴啊！幾乎受了戚脅似的要退出那橋頭；不過他們却都『開」到來了，巧得很，「五路大軍」竟差不多同時集中在那囊，有兩路先變了一路，四個隊伍變了一條長龍，中間點綴了火光，唱着同一的歌曲，——目然是最熟鍊的「我的敵人兇似狼」，過橋來了。燈籠都高高提起，映着我們，似乎要看淸楚我們的面目，眞敎人窘起來的。——他們是那樣的莊嚴啊！我們祗能給他們鼓掌，口裏却都沒有和他們一起唱。孩子中有幾個停止了唱，望着我們迷迷的笑，都向那間小學校去了，東方的雲層開始要射出了燦然的紅光。</p>
<p>這是三個月前的事了；但我的腦海裏還留着一個鮮明的印象，偶然還會盪着那一羣孩子的熱烈的歌唱的震響，我到了這裏來偶然聽聽擦鞋童的歌調了，那地方在時濃時淡的烽煙中，斷送了不少的精華；那一帶稻田，都已收割了吧？泥土中祗剩了稻草的死去了的根頭，寒風刮起了泥塵，有點荒凉而悽愴了吧？所有的中學校都散了，但小學校的大門還洞開着，我相信，那一羣孩子還在那裏唱着「我的敵人兇狼似」的！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Anglo-French Secret Agreement and the German-Italian-Japanese Military Alliance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Last night, the Associated Press in London reported: "The United Kingdom and France have signed a secret agreement, mutually agreeing to jointly protect Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland from foreign aggression." On the other hand, the same agency reported from Berlin: "According to extremely reliable sources, the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will soon be transformed into a military alliance agreement." This is the inevitable culmination of the escalating antagonism between the aggressive and anti-aggressive fronts in the world. Originally, the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance had been brewing for a long time. The joint military and diplomatic conference of Germany, Italy, and Japan in Berlin a month ago already had the practicality of signing the agreement. Now that Hitler feels the need to further promote new aggressions and stabilize old ones, it is only natural and inevitable that Germany more actively demands that Italy and Japan come out again to cheer and support Germany, and it is not surprising. Berlin diplomatic circles believe: "If the European 'Anti-Hitler Front' is completed, it will be an excellent opportunity for Germany, Italy, and Japan to proceed with a military alliance" (yesterday's Associated Press report). In fact, even without the establishment of an "Anti-Hitler Front," the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance would still be realized. The "Nazi" side's revelation that "negotiations for this military alliance have already been underway for some time" is honest, but the release of such honesty at this time may have other intentions.</p>
<p>Regarding the collusion of the German-Italian-Japanese aggressors, what needs to be deeply understood is their current style. Hitler is now not only occupying Slovakia and annexing Memel, but also subjugating Romania and signing an economic agreement with Germany. Hitler has devoured a lot of things in this short period. No matter how strong his appetite is, he must rest a little. However, the methods of this "heroic soldier" (Göring's flattery) are different. According to our speculation, although Hitler needs a little rest, and in fact must rest temporarily, he will inevitably adopt a political strategy of "advancing as a retreat." The methods will be nothing more than (1) issuing more declarations threatening Britain and France, and making more gestures to strike at Britain and France; (2) wooing and instigating the accomplices Italy and Japan to act more actively in the Mediterranean and the Far East, in order to threaten Britain and France not to interfere with his consolidation in Eastern Europe, so that he can safely achieve greater results. The other day, all newspapers in Berlin widely publicized: How Mussolini will make a tough speech next Sunday; last night, the German "Asia News Agency" threatened: "Italy will make demands on France with extremely tough measures," and at the same time cheered Mussolini: "Italy's demands are as important as Germany's demands, and if necessary, the two countries will fight together," and also said: "It is believed that Italy will obtain satisfaction in the inevitable war." On the other hand, the Japanese cabinet convened an emergency cabinet meeting all night, "to discuss the European situation caused by Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, and the new diplomatic policies that Japan should adopt." According to our observation, Japan's so-called new diplomatic policy will be nothing more than two points: first, to further establish closer contact with the two accomplices, Germany and Italy, or even completely follow Hitler's demands, focusing on coercing Britain and France in the Far East; second, to take this opportunity to more actively launch military operations in Central and Southern China, coercing China to "surrender" in order to end the increasingly deeply mired invasion war. The fragile Japanese imperialism, knowing that it does not have the strength to launch a two-front war, and understanding that Hitler will not attack the Soviet Union at present, abandoned its northward advance and focused on the southward advance. The Japanese side has already yielded to the Soviet Union, willing to participate in the auction bidding for Soviet fishing areas; military operations in Central and Southern China have also become more active. Hitler is indeed an extremely clever "hero," and Italy and Japan have completely become Hitler's two hands.</p>
<p>However, in the situation where the aggressive front is becoming increasingly consolidated and strengthened, how is the development of the anti-aggressive front? The rumored Anglo-French secret agreement may have a considerable possibility, and the Four-Power Declaration can also be issued. The United States has decided not to recognize Germany's annexation of Memel. The strength of the democratic bloc is indeed increasing day by day, but it always feels fragile, slow, dispersed, and even too selfish and isolated. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference of nine European countries seems to be as we predicted, unable to be realized, and more concrete cooperation between the Soviet Union is temporarily not possible. Even if we examine the rumored Anglo-French secret agreement, what Britain and France are seeking is limited to stabilizing Central Europe. They only want to protect the small Central European countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. As for the Eastern European countries, they have been left behind. No wonder the small Eastern European countries have been defeated by Hitler one by one, and they are all vying to submit to the "Nazi Eastern Crusade."</p>
<p>Today, we cannot help but say that Britain and France should take advantage of Hitler's need to rest after his rampage to express a tougher attitude towards the aggressors in order to prevent the accomplices Italy and Japan from taking advantage of the situation to act rashly; on the other hand, they should more sincerely and practically contact the United States and the Soviet Union, and even other small countries, to form an "anti-aggressive front." The situation has become urgent, and the "anti-aggressive front" must not be allowed to continue to be so dispersed and suspicious. Even empty bluster cannot stop the arrogance of the aggressors.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Wartime Democracy and Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Zhen</p>
<p>Since the formal establishment of the National Political Council, the call for establishing local political councils and establishing local public opinion bodies has been loud and clear, forming a unanimous national demand. The authorities then made the decision to organize provincial, municipal, and county councils, and announced their organizational laws. Later, because the situations in various places were different, most provinces and cities failed to submit their lists within the deadline. Now that the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has entered a brand-new stage, and the national strength urgently needs to be concentrated and brought into play, the need to establish local public opinion bodies is felt to be even more urgent. Here, we will briefly discuss the great historical significance borne by the provincial, municipal, and county councils at the current stage, and their major tasks in striving for the final success of the War of Resistance, for the reference of all those who care about national affairs.</p>
<p>1.  The Urgent Need to Implement Democracy During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The final success of the Chinese nation's War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is inseparable from the implementation of a democratic and legal system. The decision made by the Kuomintang's Provisional National Congress last year to convene the National Political Council was aimed at adapting to the urgent needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, concentrating the strength of the whole country to eliminate the unprecedented national crisis, and gathering the will of the whole country to establish a foundation for democratic nation-building. On February 21st, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said in his closing remarks at the Third National Political Council: "The historical mission of this council (the National Political Council) is to establish a foundation for democratic politics, especially to establish a permanent and true foundation for democratic politics… Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Three Principles of the People, and the ultimate goal of his Principle of Democracy is democratic politics. If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot create a happy country. Therefore, the greatest, most powerful, and most solid politics in the world must be built on public opinion, and must take the interests of the people as their own, and the people's vision as their own. Dr. Sun's ideal is to create a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, which is the same throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad. We are now fighting the war on the one hand and building the nation on the other. To achieve victory in the War of Resistance and success in nation-building, we must not rely solely on military force, but must mobilize the spirit of the masses and organize the spirit of the masses that has already been launched, using the sum of the spiritual will and strength of the whole country to be the backing for the soldiers at the front and the driving force for the development of the rear. Therefore, in addition to strengthening military power, it is even more necessary to gather public opinion. The reason why the Provisional National Congress last year resolved to convene the National Political Council was on the one hand to hope that the true public opinion of the whole country could be concretely expressed through our councilors, so that the government could understand the people's suffering, know the people's hopes, and use them as the basis for governance. At the same time, we hope that our councilors will use their status, prestige, and experience to express the people's views on the major plans for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and actively contribute our talents and experience," "to create a truly democratic nation in this arduous period of the War of Resistance." From this, it can be imagined that in this difficult period of the War of Resistance, there is an even greater need for the active promotion of democratic politics, so that the mobilization of the masses, the organization of the masses, and the launching of the spiritual will and strength of the whole country can be smoothly realized.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Zedong also clearly stated in his famous report "On the New Stage": "Democratic politics is the advancing engine for launching all the lively forces of the entire nation. With this system, the anti-Japanese enthusiasm of the entire people will be immeasurably launched and become an inexhaustible source. The completion of the great process of the thorough unification and solidarity of our entire nation can only be based on the establishment of a democratic system." He also said: "Regarding this point... all are for the purpose of closely linking the government and the people, increasing the strength of the government, so that it can play its important role in the War of Resistance against Japan. There is no question that any local government in the country should be concentrated under the leadership of the central government, and there should be no expression of disrespect for the central leadership due to the administrative regions being divided geographically. The whole country must implement democracy in accordance with the central laws, but the whole country must be unified under the central government." From this, it can be even more imagined that if we do not actively promote democracy today, and if we do not actively improve politics today, we will not be able to support the long and arduous War of Resistance against Japan, and we will not be able to realize the victory of the War of Resistance and the success of nation-building.</p>
<p>The Third National Political Council also passed the "Proposal to Establish a Democratic and Legal System to Lay the Foundation for National Reconstruction," proposed by Huang Yanpei and 49 others. The opening of the original proposal also clearly pointed out: "At this time when the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly favorable and national reconstruction is beginning, it is especially appropriate to encourage the system of democracy and the rule of law, in order to achieve the most substantial achievements in political tutelage and to lay a solid foundation for constitutionalism." In addition, this conference also passed the "Proposal to Strengthen the Realization of Democracy and Inspire Public Morale to Benefit the War of Resistance," proposed by councilor Dong Biwu and 26 others. This can prove that at this new stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, it is necessary to quickly and definitely promote democratic politics. This is not only the clear indication of the wise national leader, but also the common requirement of the councilors who represent the public opinion of the whole country. All of this can show that our work to establish a foundation for democratic politics will have a more important and practical development in the future, and will open up an unprecedentedly brilliant page in the revolutionary history of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>2.  The Important Position of Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils</p>
<p>True democratic politics lies in the broad masses of the people obtaining various opportunities and organizations to participate in national politics. The current War of Resistance and National Reconstruction in China aims not only to expel the Japanese through the War of Resistance and restore our rivers and mountains, but also to establish a new China of the Three Principles of the People, a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, through the War of Resistance, and also to gradually realize democratic politics in the difficult process of the War of Resistance. Today, the most urgent requirement of the first step is for the broad masses of the people to obtain various opportunities and organizations to actively participate in the work of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Here, we cannot but express our deep expectations for the National Political Council in the national scope and the political councils in various local areas of the country.</p>
<p>(1) The National Political Council and Democracy</p>
<p>The National Political Council is neither the same as the parliamentary organizations of various democratic countries in the world today, nor is it the purely public opinion body that we need and hope for, but based on the motives for the establishment of the National Political Council and its achievements since its establishment, it can already be worthy of the reputation of a "transitional public opinion body during the War of Resistance," and should occupy a glorious page in the history of nation-building of the Chinese nation. Chairman Chiang's instruction that the historical mission of the National Political Council is to "establish a foundation for democratic politics, especially a permanent and true foundation for democratic politics," should especially be trusted by us.</p>
<p>However, in order for the National Political Council to truly be able to live up to its great mission, the first lies in the fact that the organization of the National Political Council and the generation of councilors must be in accordance with the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy. Regarding this point, of course, we still need to work hard to promote its thorough realization. The second lies in the fact that every councilor must understand that he is a representative of the hardworking and productive people, and at all times and in all places insist on his glorious and important position. This point has given people a clear expression and inspires respect and belief since the defection of the President of the Council, Wang Jingwei, from the motherland. Third, it is even more dependent on the propaganda and mobilization of the national public opinion circles and the enthusiastic participation of the nationally awakened masses; we have done very insufficiently in this point in the past, especially the relatively indifferent attitude of the general public towards the National Political Council, which requires us to make redoubled efforts to improve.</p>
<p>(2) The Past Achievements of the National Political Council</p>
<p>However, the National Political Council has been established for less than a year, and its great achievements in promoting democratic politics and assisting the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction should be valued by us. The first is that the first conference passed the proposal to support the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Program, the second conference passed the proposal to support the national policy of protracted war, and the third conference passed the proposal to support the national policy of protracted war. This enhanced the strength of the government and the people, and clarified the vision of China and foreign countries. On the one hand, it gave a major blow to the anti-communist, ceasefire, and compromise conspiracies advocated by traitors and collaborators, and on the other hand, it raised the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence in adhering to unity and resisting Japan and building the nation. The second is that it has passed many important proposals concerning various departments of military affairs, people's livelihood, internal affairs, diplomacy, finance, economy, education, and culture. Most of these proposals have been accepted by the government or have been gradually implemented, and have made considerable contributions to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Third, as Chairman Chiang said in his opening speech at the three conferences of the National Political Council: "In addition to working hard to participate in the meetings, many councilors are also engaged in the practical work of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction outside the meetings. Whether in the war zone or in the rear, our councilors have made adventurous, difficult, and outstanding efforts."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang also reminded everyone: "If the spirit of our national sages and talented people, and leaders can be uplifted, and the will of the government and the people can be connected, and the strength of the government and the people can be gathered, this effect will be ten times greater than raising the spirit of brave sacrifice of officers and soldiers on the front line!" However, regarding this point, if we only rely on the efforts of a few councilors, it is naturally not enough in fact. The rapid establishment of local public opinion bodies is particularly important at the current stage!</p>
<p>(3) Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils in the New Stage of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The current new stage of the War of Resistance is the stage of stopping the Japanese from advancing and preparing for our army's counter-offensive. It can also be said to be the stage of turning defeat into victory, turning passivity into initiative, and preparing to drive out all the Japanese invaders and restore our rivers and mountains. In order to strive for the victory and success of this stage, it lies in intensifying the blows to weaken all the forces of the Japanese invaders, and especially in intensifying the growth of our new forces. This depends on the total mobilization of the lively forces of the entire nation, and the establishment of local public opinion bodies and their practical responsibility are even more important.</p>
<p>In order to rapidly establish local public opinion bodies, the authorities have decided to establish temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils. Now, all provinces and cities have been ordered to prepare as soon as possible, and Guangdong Province has also decided to formally establish it on April 1st. In addition to hoping that all provinces, cities, and counties can prepare for establishment as soon as possible, in view of the urgent needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance, the temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils must at least achieve the following points:</p>
<p>First, the temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils must become true local public opinion bodies and strive to lay the foundation for the implementation of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Second, promote the spirit of the National Political Council and closely link the government and the people.</p>
<p>Third, realize the total mobilization of the spirit and material strength of the entire people on a larger scale to adapt to the new needs of the front, the rear, and the struggle after the Japanese retreat.</p>
<p>3.  A Model of a Temporary Council</p>
<p>Since the government announced the organizational law of the temporary provincial, municipal, and county councils and ordered them to be established within a time limit, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government took the lead in complying with the order and actively prepared for it. It held an inaugural meeting in Yan'an in early February of this year, which seems to be worthy of important reference for other provinces, cities, and counties. According to a telegram from Yan'an by the Associated Press on February 7:</p>
<p>The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Temporary Council is the first popular legislative representative assembly in Chinese history. It has been meeting here for a week and has now closed. The council has passed the following major proposals:</p>
<p>1.  Free distribution of land to soldiers returning from the front line.</p>
<p>2.  Implementation of confiscation of traitor property.</p>
<p>3.  Prohibition of marriage for those suffering from venereal diseases, leprosy, madness, and incurable diseases.</p>
<p>4.  No marriage is allowed for women under the age of 18 and men under the age of 20.</p>
<p>5.  Stipulation of divorce law, divorce is allowed for those who are bigamous, incompatible, have illicit relationships, and are unable to bear children.</p>
<p>6.  Guarantee of freedom of speech, publication, religion, and assembly.</p>
<p>7.  Implementation of complete equality between men and women in politics, economy, and society.</p>
<p>8.  Implementation of complete equality among all ethnic groups in the country, allowing the minority groups of the five races to maintain their original customs and family education.</p>
<p>9.  Forced implementation of military training.</p>
<p>10. The government provides relief to the sick, the elderly, orphans, and widows.</p>
<p>11. Implementation of agricultural education, reclamation of wasteland, and protection of forests.</p>
<p>12. Government officials and students must support themselves in order to reduce government expenses (officials and students at all levels are provided with clothing, food, accommodation, and a salary of no more than five yuan).</p>
<p>13. Implementation of an eight-hour workday.</p>
<p>14. Abolition of usury, with the government lending money to the people and charging low interest rates.</p>
<p>15. Establishment and organization of government and court laws, prohibiting all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies except for farmers donating no more than seven percent of agricultural products.</p>
<p>According to Lin Boqu (Zu Han), chairman of the Border Region Government, told the Associated Press reporter: "In 1937, the people elected representatives from various districts to meet. This time, the representatives to the Border Region People's Congress were elected by secret ballot. This is the first meeting, and all administrative officials are elected in this way. Workers, farmers, and the middle class from all over the country elect representatives according to their numbers. The result of this legislative meeting has laid the initial foundation for democratic politics."</p>
<p>4.  Practical Facilities for Wartime Democracy</p>
<p>The main guarantee for the final victory and success of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is the gradual implementation of democratic politics under centralized leadership, and the main guarantee for the implementation of democratic politics during the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is the smooth and practical development of the work of the National Political Council and the establishment of provincial, municipal, and county councils as true public opinion bodies. In the past year, with the great achievements of the National Political Council and the successive establishment or preparation for establishment of provincial, municipal, and county councils, we have already begun to take the first step in implementing democratic politics. In the future, as long as everyone works together to supervise and assist the accelerated promotion of all the work of these national and local public opinion bodies, and all the resolutions of these bodies are conscientiously and practically implemented by the government, we can gradually promote true democratic politics. However, in order to guarantee the smooth progress of this major work, we feel that it is still necessary to quickly and practically pay attention to the following points: First, it is necessary to guarantee the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, religion, and ideological belief of the people as stipulated in the "Program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," so as to fully unleash the strength of the entire nation for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. On the one hand, we must absolutely guarantee that all central laws are implemented in all parts of the country without being arbitrarily restricted by any local government, and on the other hand, we must restrict the freedom of speech and action that violates the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and restrict the freedom of speech and action of traitors and pro-Japanese elements.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to follow the instructions in the recent declarations and documents of the supreme leader, and begin to implement thorough democratic politics in the war zones and in the areas behind the enemy lines and occupied areas, and establish democratic political power for the anti-Japanese revolution. As for the specific methods, such as implementing popular elections for local governments at all levels and then entrusting them by higher levels, such as adopting a democratic committee system in governments at all levels in the war zones, and establishing people's representative bodies at all levels, such as adding several necessary working departments to the war zone governments, such as eliminating corrupt and degenerate elements, absorbing active elements who are willing to dedicate themselves to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and stipulating that the local governments in the war zones have the power to promulgate local regulations under the unified leadership of the central government. Stipulating that all male and female citizens in the war zones who are not traitors or pro-Japanese elements have the right to elect and be elected, as well as the right to freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and armed resistance, and can implement the open and legal status of all anti-Japanese parties in the war zones, in order to further realize true democratic politics and make all the spiritual and material forces of the entire nation truly mobilized, concentrated, unified, and utilized.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is a long and arduous undertaking. The success of the national revolution and the prospects are still very distant. We must adhere to the long-term unity of the whole country, intensify the total spiritual mobilization of the whole people, and work harder to promote the implementation of democratic politics under centralized leadership during the war.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Treasure House of Xikang (Part 1) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Kangding Correspondence: Since the military rise, most of the coastal ports have been blockaded by the Japanese, and all wartime and peacetime resources have been greatly affected. Developing resources and supplementing the front line is the urgent task at hand. Xikang is rich in products, especially mineral resources. Since the establishment of the province, the authorities have paid attention to surveying various natural resources, and the virgin land that has been mysterious and unexplored since ancient times will also be actively utilized and developed separately.</p>
<p>Rongjing Has Many Mines</p>
<p>During this visit to Kang, the reporter paid special attention to the investigation of various sectors of the economy and the mineral resources. Last month, when I passed through Rongjing, I had already investigated in detail and reported truthfully on the reserves and quality of the red iron ore in the county. However, Rongjing's mineral products are not limited to red iron ore. There are also large reserves of bituminous coal in the Huajianzi, Banjing, and Huayan areas, and anthracite coal in the Ronghe River basin. In addition, copper mines are also rich in all districts of the county. In addition, there are millions of hardwood trees with diameters of more than one foot produced in the Xiangling area, which can be used for railway sleepers. The great Rongjing is almost a real treasure house. How the country should use and develop these rich resources to strengthen its power is something that the authorities should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Copper Mine Suspended</p>
<p>Rongjing is located southwest of Ya'an, with high peaks and deep valleys, and dangerous natural barriers, guarding the thoroughfare between Sichuan and Xikang. The county's mineral deposits are the best in eastern Kang. In addition to coal and iron, copper mines are also abundant. According to the reporter's investigation in recent days, copper mines are found in all districts of the county. The mines in Daihuangou and Shanxilin in the northern district are the most promising, and the mines in Qianhou Zhaoba in the eastern district are second. The discovery of the Shanxilin copper mine has not been around for many dynasties, and the old tunnels that have been operated are only thirty or forty feet deep. The reason for its suspension is indeed flooding by yang water, not abandonment due to exhaustion of the mine. Therefore, today, reopening it must still be carried out along the old tunnels in Shanxilin in order to be sure. In the past, there were two mines in the area, one was the Fuxing Factory owned by the Ma family, which was founded in the twentieth year of Guangxu, and the other was the Sanyuan Factory owned by the Li family. By the beginning of the Republic, it had been dug to a depth of forty feet. However, as the mining developed in all directions, it pierced the wall of the Baodian Cave, and the water flowed in horizontally, also resulting in the mine being destroyed. It has been suspended to this day, which is a pity.</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Importance of Spiritual Mobilization <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Soong Mei-ling</p>
<p>It is a very common principle in modern life that when a person becomes ill, they must seek treatment from a doctor. To ensure that the disease can be treated, the source of the illness must first be diagnosed. If there is a need for surgery, one should not hesitate to ask the doctor to operate. If it is discovered that the patient's internal organs have been fundamentally impaired due to neglect in their lifestyle, it is of course necessary to take urgent measures to restore them to their normal state.</p>
<p>Just as this is true for individuals, it is also true for countries and their administrative institutions; it is true for countries with well-established organizations and proper governance, and it certainly should be true for our China.</p>
<p>Precisely because our country must take the quickest methods to restore the vitality of the people (which can be achieved simply by appropriately applying effective modern scientific methods), I have, in the past nine weeks, exposed the root causes of the political ailments that have severely corroded us for several generations. Perhaps I have been too direct, speaking about some traditional chronic diseases in a completely naked and undisguised manner; however, I knowingly did so because I felt it was necessary. We must first understand our own worst shortcomings, and then we can hope to get rid of the old and usher in the new, and achieve the most perfect state.</p>
<p>I hope to stir the conscience of those who have neglected their duties and harmed the public, causing them to repent of their past mistakes, or else resign from their positions. I also hope to move all honest, pure, patriotic compatriots who have the will and ability to examine and correct the nation's shortcomings, to concentrate their sincere enthusiasm, to carry out vigorous reforms, and to rebuild our country.</p>
<p>By criticizing the various parts of society in this way, I hope to sow seeds throughout the country, so that our intellectual class can work together to eliminate those obsolete, wasteful, and inefficient old methods, as well as all bad habits and customs, in administrative, economic, and other undertakings. I also hold the same enthusiasm, eagerly desiring intellectuals to quickly adopt new methods that have proven effective, and to use their wisdom, loyalty, and strength to develop our hidden human and material resources, so that the War of Resistance against Japan will be won as soon as possible, and a new Republic of China will be forged from the crucible of this war, which has sacrificed so many compatriots and so much wealth.</p>
<p>In the nine articles above, most of my attention was focused on the material conditions for building a new China; in this final article, I want to specifically discuss the importance of national spiritual renewal and its relationship to the work of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Regarding spiritual renewal, the Supreme National Defense Council has already announced the Outline for the National Spiritual Mobilization on March 12, urging the entire country to implement it consistently. This plan grasps the basic points of how to eliminate the various national shortcomings that I have declared, and strives to mobilize the essence of our national spirit to meet the needs of the country. The outline explains the intention of the National Spiritual Mobilization as:</p>
<p>"To gather the spirit of the people of the whole country to a simple common goal, so that the people of the whole country can establish the same patriotic morality for themselves, and firmly establish the same belief in national construction for the country, and that every member of the people can struggle and sacrifice for the same belief based on the same moral concept." This summary contains many of the principles that I ask everyone to implement. Now, a National Spiritual Mobilization Council has been established, with the Chairman serving as the President, to promote and implement this movement. In terms of implementation, the goal is to encourage the people of the whole country to become active and do their best to create the national life and patriotic spirit that are indispensable for the revival of China.</p>
<p>This is a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years, to awaken all qualified and knowledgeable people to make drastic reforms for the country. Anyone who cannot use this opportunity to make a contribution is giving up their qualifications as a citizen; those who are willing to work hard according to this outline will surely make a practical contribution in the process of winning the War of Resistance and successfully building the country, and will surely receive lasting comfort.</p>
<p>Whether this spiritual rejuvenation can affect the entire nation can be understood by slightly studying the national character that the enemy has exposed to the world in the past twenty months of brutal aggression against China. Previously, the Japanese boasted of two outstanding characteristics: one was the spirit of the samurai contained in their Bushido education; the other was the material progress shown by their industrial development and new military equipment.</p>
<p>Before the Japanese military leaders decided to carry out their international policy to invade China, world opinion generally accepted the Japanese's own assessment, acknowledging them as a civilized, cultured, and chivalrous nation. At the same time, people from all over the world unconditionally acknowledged that this nation possessed an invincible military force.</p>
<p>Later, when Japan launched the war with sophistry, people from all countries were also convinced that it would achieve a quick and humane victory; but in just a few months, the public opinion of the world had undergone a historically amazing transformation. Brutality followed brutality, and Christians all over the world were shocked and dumbfounded to see Japanese officers and soldiers committing all kinds of evil. The heroic qualities shown by the Chinese army and the sustained determination of the Chinese people to resist the war made the Japanese soldiers panic and had to tear off their mask of civilization and chivalry. They tried their best to display their character of injustice and indiscipline, and did not hesitate to carry out all kinds of illegal, untrustworthy, and inhuman atrocities in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>People from all over the world have been shocked and amazed by this, but the Japanese continue their inhuman behavior month after month, losing all the reputation they had previously gained through hypocrisy, and their true colors are becoming more and more exposed, showing that they are a lawless hodgepodge and a product of barbaric materialism. They irrationally believe in "might makes right" and foolishly regard themselves as descendants of gods, and regard those who do not obey their will as scum that should be swept away from the earth.</p>
<p>What good this pure materialism will do them remains to be seen in future history; but based on the facts that have already been revealed, it can also become a beneficial lesson for our people across the country. Japan is on the verge of collapse. Human heredity originally has spiritual qualities, but Japan has devoted all its efforts to the development of material and military power for the past sixty years, completely ignoring the cultivation of the spiritual aspects of the people. This is the reason for its collapse.</p>
<p>Such a profound lesson and warning are deeply imprinted on the souls of our nation and individuals, so we must absorb all the virtues of our ancestors into our lives and keep them respectfully. These virtues have not only enabled us to survive for thousands of years, but also enabled us, this great, hardworking, and unarmed nation, to overcome all kinds of the most inhumane war disasters.</p>
<p>According to the plan for spiritual mobilization announced by the government, we must improve and enrich our own lives, and we should bravely move forward on this spiritual path: we should actively, confidently, and unyieldingly implement the various programs stipulated in this plan, we should promote it and make it shine, and at the same time, we should make full use of other spiritually valuable forces to help its completion.</p>
<p>In this current period, we should rebuild our country on a spiritual foundation, cultivate our precious cultural traditions, and build all our due constructions in a sound and complete manner. Since the people of our China have been spiritually mobilized to engage in the work of national construction, we will surely preserve our nation and our own right to survival. We should not be discouraged, nor should we be afraid of others. We can be inspired by that sensitive Latin word Resvrgam "I will rise again", and receive infinite comfort and honor. We should make full use of this inspiration to complete the rejuvenation of our nation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 14th] The Ministry of Transport's three-engine Junkers aircraft "Lanzhou" left here at 7:00 this morning for the first official flight on the new China-Soviet air route. The plane will spend the night in Lanzhou, and continue to fly to Hami, the end point of the Chinese section of the route, the next morning.

<h3 id="e15">From Laohekou to Xi'an Part 1 <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this newspaper: Geng Ya</p>
<p>From Laohekou, the transportation center in northern Hubei, you can take a bus north to Nanyang, east to Yancheng, a stronghold on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, or north to Luoyang, a stronghold on the Kaihai Road. If you go west along the Han River, you can reach Hanzhong on the southern route and Chang'an on the northern route. The reporter decided to take the last route, that is, to go to Chang'an first.</p>
<p>At the "de facto but not de jure" ticket office of the Taihe Inn outside the South Gate of Laohekou, a temporary ticket with the word "full" or "half" written in ink was purchased according to the registration procedures, and was taken away when the car was about to start. The procedure was sloppy, causing suspicion: first, the number of people was crowded, exceeding the quota; second, military personnel were given half-price tickets, which were said to be limited to five; third, it is said that the car on this road is operated by the Shaanxi Construction Department, but there are no formal signs and documents, so everyone guesses that this business must be a "knockoff" operated by the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Department. If you have to transfer to a Shaanxi Provincial Orphanage car when passing through Shangxian the next day, there will be many malpractices, which will undoubtedly be thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>Even some selfish drivers of military vehicles, especially those who changed from commercial vehicles to military vehicles, dared to steal and sell gasoline in order to enrich themselves; or colluded with the heads of various gas stations, saying that the gas station had no stock, and then bought it at a higher price, so as to make false reports and cheat. What is more serious is that some people in the agencies that control goods in various places also want to make a fortune from the national crisis. Their conscience is really gone! But as the ancients said, "What comes in improperly goes out improperly." Those who usually swallow public funds to enrich themselves have never had a good end, and those who catch fish in troubled waters during wartime will certainly not get beans from planting melons.</p>
<p>The car initially traveled tens of miles, and the road surface was very bad - the car was too late that day, and the driver tried desperately to catch up, and overturned once in Xixiakou, Henan Province. Fortunately, the place was not a deep pit, and no major disaster was caused, and it arrived late in Xiping Town to stay. The town has an earthen wall and a fairly dense population. There were no hotels before. This spring, roads were built and traffic was opened, and restaurants made a fortune. Only bamboo were used to separate rooms for guests. The villagers call the waiter "shop second", and the shop second responds immediately when called, with ancient sounds and ancient music, which is quite laughable. Chen Zhejun, a young military officer from the Northeast, talked about the news of the war in the next room, involving the truth about how to transport fresh troops to the rear, which was especially interesting.</p>
<p>The next day, the car passed the border between Henan and Shaanxi, and what I saw was a dilapidated and ruined city, which is said to be the place where Guan Yu, during the Three Kingdoms period, passed five passes and killed six generals. The mountains are steep, the river courses are curved, and in the wilderness outside the city, the majestic killing sounds of the army's field exercises make you feel excited, happy, and have a hope: if this ancient battlefield becomes a modern battlefield, that is, when their fake exercises become real victories!</p>
<p>The organization of the Red Spear Society in this area is also developing vigorously. Along the way, I saw their public exercises, which were similar to the national exercises, but the ranks used new-style military exercises, all with a unique style. There is another kind of secret exercise called "sending the knife"; it is said that when the knife is sent effectively, it can kill without being injured in a hail of bullets. Sending the knife must be held in a quiet room at night. At that time, all sounds are silent and the four elements are empty. First, burn incense and worship in the shrine, and then listen to the master's instructions on spells. Stand on the cross drawn on the spot, and you can not speak and bear the knife and gun records with your arms, chest and abdomen without being injured. The magic of sending the knife has what is called "black three ways", which can be tested to the time (that is, 24 hours); there is also "red three ways", which can be tested to a month. During the period, you can rush to kill the × without hindrance. They call themselves "Red Spear Society" to the outside world, and those who are in charge of the entire society are called "Chairman" or "President"; but internally they call themselves "God Group", and call the chairman "Group Head", and call the teacher of martial arts the commander. The number of people in each association ranges from hundreds to thousands or tens of thousands, but the vast majority are strong and solid farmers. Associations have contact with each other, watch out for each other, and support each other in and out. In short, although his organization and appeal have a color of superstitious theocracy, they are essentially a people's self-defense force. Once they are publicized by the county governments and the political workers of the stationed troops in various places, they will participate in the great war of national resistance and contribute their great potential forces as much as possible. The Red Spear Society in southern Henan and northern Anhui used false surrenders to lure × to gather and annihilate them; Master Hou of Yitiaoshan in southern Shanxi led the masses to assist the Datu army and repeatedly made surprise attacks against × - these are all good examples of the Red Spear Society's heroic resistance to the war.</p>
<p>Also, the mountains and ridges in the border area of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, such as Zijingguan, Nanshan, and Yunxi, were all areas with a heavy banditry in the past. Since the War of Resistance, two or three thousand people have been recruited successively by the authorities, given strict organization and training, and transported to the rear to work. However, Liu Songlin, a well-known bandit who had been entrenched in Longju Village, Shang County, Shaanxi Province, for five or six years, gathered more than 800 bandits and refused to accept orders. He was also attacked by Wen Liangxu, the commissioner of the area, a few days before the reporter passed through Shang County. After a fierce battle for five days and nights, they were all wiped out. Therefore, local transportation has become safe.</p>
<p>The method of digging cave dwellings by the people in this area is very dangerous and strange. They dig living rooms and halls in the inner layers of dangerous cliffs and precipices, layer upon layer, with winding paths leading to secluded places, which can house dozens of households and accommodate hundreds of people. The entire cave dwelling only opens a main door at the top of the mountain, or leaves a passage at the bottom. Strangers ask about it before entering, only to see layers of wall windows with sewage flowing down, often unable to find the door.</p>
<p>These residents who live high on the cliffs and walls, like the residents of the Yungang Mountains and the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, sometimes see opportunities to take advantage of and also engage in robbing passers-by. Because the cave is dark and there are many holes, and there are even grain storage water sources, it is difficult to arrest them after repeated crimes. But in the future, it may be a good base for guerrillas. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Customs Releases Statistics: China's Foreign Trade, Surplus Increases Daily in Chongqing Occupied Areas, Monthly Surplus in Various Rear Areas <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The Directorate General of Customs has recently released foreign trade statistics for China for the past year, listing the import and export trade of various ports in China. It is divided into two parts, with a one-month unit: "Ports under the control of the Chinese government" and "Ports under Japanese occupation." If a port is still in the hands of the Chinese army this month but falls next month, it will be included in the second part from next month. This way, the actual trade development situation of the "free China" part and the "occupied China" part can be clearly seen. According to the statistics, under the control of the National Government, the deficit in January last year reached approximately £1.34 million. By the end of the year, the average monthly surplus was approximately £240,000. Conversely, in the "occupied areas," the deficit in foreign trade was £400,500 in January last year. After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan in November and December last year, the deficit suddenly increased to approximately £1,192,500 per month. During the past year, imported goods in the "free China" area decreased by approximately 82%. As for the export of goods, the successive fall of commercial ports should have shown a sharp decline, but in fact, the decrease was only 52%. Exports from the "occupied areas" increased by 133%, while imports increased by as much as 192%. The value of exported goods in the table is converted into pounds according to the average exchange rate of the pound each month, so that the relationship between them can be more easily understood. This is because the fluctuations of other currencies were very large last year, and using them as a unit would be more confusing.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th] Mr. Kiyoshi Yamada of Tokyo recently raised the serious situation of public health in Japan in the Diet, urging members to pay attention. He said that millions of people suffer from lung disease every year, among which 100,000 die from the disease. The infant mortality rate is also extremely high. Japan cannot boast about this matter. The main reason for the large number of tuberculosis patients in Japan is that most of the people cannot obtain nutritious food.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th] In a Diet session one day, someone raised the question of whether the shortage of labor in military factories and similar other government organizations was due to low wages. A representative of the Ministry of the Army strongly stated that there was no shortage of labor and that wages were not low. Last year, the minimum wage for male workers was 38 sen, and the maximum was 6.48 yen. The minimum wage for female workers was 31 sen, and the maximum was 1.56 yen. The average wage was 1.30 yen for male workers and 80 sen for female workers. The average wage for workers in private military factories in Tokyo is about 6 yen (wages are calculated daily). It is heard that the wages of workers manufacturing aircraft engines are the highest. The Japanese military industry will employ 25,000 graduates of elementary schools in Tokyo and 10,000 people from rural areas next month. The main sources are from the eastern and northeastern regions, but there will still be a need for 35,000 child laborers.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Picturesque Yangshuo, Song Zheyuan Recuperates on the Side of Ma'anshan Mountain, Magistrates Zhu and Liu Bury Themselves in Hard Work <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>It is the season when the rainy season returns to southern China. At the invitation of an international friend stationed in Guilin, I took a break to visit Yangshuo.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Administration</p>
<p>Yangshuo is bounded by the Peng River in the east, and surrounded by layers of green mountains in the west, south, and north. The county town is limited by the mountains and rivers, and its area is probably less than four square li. The population is only over 300 households. Apart from the market days on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of the month, there is no commerce to speak of. Baisha Market, 18 li north of the county town, Fuli Market in the southeast, and Yuping Market, 30-40 li northeast, surround it. These markets have several times more population than the county town and have more lively streets that the county town does not have. They make the county town isolated and desolate. I had several meetings with County Magistrate Zhu Mo and Deputy County Magistrate Liu Biguang. They maintain the simplicity and sincerity of the Guangxi local government officials. The county magistrate, in the past, and even now outside of Guangxi, is still the "hundred-li marquis," the so-called "parent official," but County Magistrate Zhu's monthly salary is 150 Guizhou currency (75 legal tender). Although there is a government-stipulated reward of 1% of the land tax revenue that the county magistrate can receive each year, he is, after all, a county magistrate with countless unavoidable expenses and social engagements. Therefore, he still cannot bring his family from his hometown in Hubei to Yangshuo. Currently, the county government's monthly office expenses are only 200 yuan, and the oil lamp alone costs more than 100 yuan. This forces him to limit the time the local government lights its lamps, and he often tells the clerks to save paper and pens to balance revenue and expenditure. From this, I believe he lives a life of austerity. Yangshuo County is mostly mountainous with few villages. It is a poor fourth-class county. The annual regular and temporary balanced revenue and expenditure is about 120,000 yuan. The largest income is the land tax surcharge. The remaining land surcharge and local product tax account for 30%, and public property income accounts for 10%. Administrative expenses and education expenses each account for 30% of the total expenditure. There is one county high school and 14 central primary schools. There are more than 160 primary schools. According to County Magistrate Zhu, there are no school-age children who are out of school in the county, and adult education is also actively promoted. The number of illiterate people has been reduced to the minimum. Relatively speaking, there are still more illiterate women than men. The reason is that women in Guangxi work longer hours than men. As for the village women in remote and poor mountain valleys, there are more inconveniences in both promoting and accepting education. But broadly speaking, illiteracy can also be said to have been eliminated. A total of more than 1,000 people have been conscripted from the county. There are still more than 17,000 reserve soldiers under the age of 30 and 30,000 people under the age of 40, all of whom have been trained by the village chiefs and know various basic tactics. Deputy County Magistrate Liu is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. His hair is already gray, but he still retains the spirit of a young soldier. I saw him in the rain giving a speech to six companies of militiamen at the public stadium. Those militiamen were recommended by each village, five from each village. They brought their own guns, ammunition, clothing, and food, and came to the county to receive a month of guerrilla warfare training, and then brought what they learned back to teach other community soldiers who had received ordinary military training. When Deputy County Magistrate Liu led me to visit their dormitories, I felt that they got along like family. What impressed me the most was that Yangshuo County now has several guerrilla warfare bases. Those works were completed under the guidance of these two county magistrates and in cooperation with the people.</p>
<p>Visiting Song Zheyuan</p>
<p>In the past, standing at the valley entrance of Ma'anshan Mountain, you could see a large sugarcane field and a native sugar mill on the west bank of the river. Now, part of the sugarcane field is surrounded by a new bamboo fence. Under a few tall palm trees, three-room bungalows are scattered and built on the fields. That is "Jinde New Village." Every resident of Yangshuo knows that it is the villa of General Song Zheyuan. Walking into the gate, bypassing a row of screen-like bamboos, is a small hall. On both sides are the reception room and the garage. As soon as you turn around, you see a guard hanging a box gun and holding the 29th Army's signature broadsword. He handed my business card to Mr. Gao Zihou, Song's chief secretary, and was immediately granted an audience. After ending his mission as Deputy Commander of the First War Zone, Song had recuperated in Nanyue for some time. In the second half of last year, because he loved the mountains and rivers of Yangshuo, he specially bought land and built a house here. Now, he is suffering from mild hemiplegia and can only barely walk in the courtyard. His family is protecting him, politely declining visits from guests. Director Gao is a cautious Shandong native who once served as the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. We had a very pleasant conversation. They have lived in the north for a long time, and the humid climate in Yangshuo, where they have not seen the sun for months, makes them feel unaccustomed. However, strolling in the mountains and rivers in the morning and evening is also a pleasant pastime after the busy military life. According to Director Gao, "Song recently took up a position as a military committee member in Yangshuo and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang for leave. Once his health recovers, he will go to Chongqing to attend meetings and handle affairs. In addition to Song's wife, sons, daughters, and several secretaries, there are also more than 60 guards. Song sometimes personally gives speeches, hoping that his subordinates will be useful to the country. Song is currently taking Chinese medicine and expects to recover in another month. Song gets up at 8 am every morning and rests at about 10 pm. His daily life consists of writing, reading scriptures, and walking." The new village occupies an area of ​​approximately 30 mu, and the purchase of land cost approximately 1,000 yuan. Although Song cannot live in Yangshuo for a long time, the structure of the houses is still very solid, costing approximately 1,000 yuan each. In the future, he plans to hand over this new village to the county government as a local industry. Song is 56 years old this year. When Director Gao sent me out of the village, I saw him wearing casual clothes, holding a cane, and chatting with his wife and daughter in the yard. He looked very good. Song is very optimistic about the future of the resistance war. He believes that Wu Peifu will never be fooled by others.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons last night about the international situation, saying that the recent actions of the German government have raised the question of whether Germany's future goals will be to control Europe or to make further attempts. On this point, Britain has made a clear statement that if the explanation of Germany proves to be correct and Germany repeats its past actions, it will inevitably cause constant resistance from Britain and other countries to maintain their freedom. As for the consultations with various governments due to the recent developments, the situation cannot be reported. However, I would like to state that if Germany engages in rational development in its export trade, Britain will not hinder it. The British government is extremely unwilling to establish relative barriers in Europe due to different domestic political systems. What we are concerned about is the use of force to threaten independent countries and force them to give up their independence. If this method is put into action, we will do our best to resist this attempt.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a declaration on the international situation in the House of Commons last night. Members of the government party greatly approved of its content and wording, believing that in the current situation, the Prime Minister's declaration is as clear and accurate as possible. Some opposition members also expressed satisfaction with the wording of the declaration. After Chamberlain's declaration, leading members of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party did not raise questions. Zeng Peiwenci did ask a question.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th] According to French political circles, the Anglo-French declaration accusing Germany of violating the agreement will not be released until Friday night after the French Foreign Minister returns from London. According to well-informed sources, the declaration will only be listed by the three powers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, because Poland refused to participate. It is heard that the British capital is advocating for a speedy release.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] According to British sources last night, the Soviet government sent a note to the British Foreign Office yesterday, expressing its agreement to the British proposal for a four-power declaration. At the same time, it was reported that Poland still has some difficulties. It has not been decided whether Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will release the declaration first.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] New York News: Three hundred and sixty-six famous writers, university provosts, union leaders, and other social celebrities have jointly issued a declaration, agreeing to boycott German goods.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] French President Lebrun's visit to Britain ended today. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and many officials from the French Embassy arrived at Victoria Station first. A few minutes later, the British King and Queen and two princesses accompanied the French President and his wife to the station. The crowd gave them a warm cheer. Later, the French President and his wife stepped into the carriage. The farewell between the French President and the British Prime Minister was particularly cordial.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Hitler left Memel at about 4 pm today, first by destroyer, then transferring to the battleship "Deutschland."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 24th] Hitler has issued the following orders for the annexation of Memel: (1) Memel is incorporated into the German Empire; (2) Memel is incorporated into the Gumbinnen district of East Prussia; (3) People of Memel who lost their German nationality in 1924, if they still reside in Memel on March 21, 1939, will be allowed to restore their German nationality; (4) All German laws will be implemented in Memel from May 1; (5) All Prussian laws will be implemented in Memel from May 1; (6) Foreign commercial issues in Memel will be resolved by the German Minister of Interior.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memel, 23rd] The large-scale advance of German naval and air forces into Memel is seen here as Germany's intention to flaunt its military power to northeastern Europe. According to opinions in political circles, 80% of Lithuania's foreign trade is transported through Memel. Therefore, Germany's influence on Lithuania will greatly increase in the future.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Memel, 24th] It has spread throughout the city that Germany intends to create a strong fortress in Memel with its navy. Since Hitler's arrival here, by yesterday afternoon, the German warships that have entered the port of Memel include three cruisers, three battleships, eight destroyers, nine torpedo boats, and five transport ships. In addition, there are several minesweepers and mine-laying boats.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 23rd] According to diplomatic circles here, if the anti-Hitler united front in Europe is completed, Germany, Italy, and Japan will take the opportunity to organize a military alliance as retaliation. Nazi sources revealed that negotiations on this goal have long been underway. According to extremely reliable sources, the Anti-Comintern Pact may soon be transformed into a military alliance. [Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] As a result of Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Memel in the past week, the population of Greater Germany has suddenly increased by 10 million people, and its territory has also expanded by 35 million miles. As for where Hitler will move in the future, various rumors are flying around and there is no consensus. The most likely ones are the following: (1) Danzig Free City; (2) The Polish Corridor that separates East Prussia from Germany; (3) Romania, whose food and oil fields are abundant and urgently needed by Germany; (4) Schleswig, which Denmark acquired after the European War; (5) Malmedy and Eupen in Belgium during the war; (6) Swiss border area. It is known that the strength of the German defense forces has greatly increased in the area adjacent to the Swiss border; (7) The two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine in France. Germany had previously stated that it would never demand the return of these two provinces.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 24th] Here is celebrating the return of Memel to Germany with enthusiasm. At the same time, according to well-informed Nazi sources, Hitler will suggest to Mussolini to take the following measures to retaliate against democratic countries: (1) Abrogate the Anglo-German naval agreement; (2) Publish documents obtained from Prague, exposing Britain's attempts to restore Czechoslovakia to its state before the Munich Agreement; (3) Actively promote commerce to resist the activities of Britain and France.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Germany and Slovakia signed a treaty today. According to the treaty, Germany is responsible for protecting the political independence and territorial integrity of Slovakia. German troops have the right to be stationed at any time in a line on the west and east sides of Slovakia (including the eastern foot of the Little Carpathian Mountains, the east of the White Carpathian Mountains, and the eastern foot of the Javorníky Mountains). Slovak customs duties are controlled by Germany, and German imports are duty-free. Military affairs and sovereignty in the above-mentioned areas are completely controlled by the German army. Slovakia will cooperate with the German army to organize its own military forces, and Slovakia's foreign policy should always be in harmony with Germany.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Brussels, 23rd] The two cities of Eupen and Malmedy originally belonged to Germany and were only transferred to Belgium after the European War. Since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, it has been widely rumored that Belgium and Germany have conducted negotiations, and Germany has provided assurances to Belgium, stating that it has no intentions towards those cities. Officials here have recently denied this. The German government solemnly declared on October 13, 1937, that it respects the territorial integrity of this country, and there is no need to conduct negotiations at this time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] According to the "Martin Report" here, as a result of negotiations between Belgium and Germany, Germany has promised Belgium territorial integrity with "certain guarantees."

<p>German Press Claims to Support Italian Demands</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 23rd] The Fascist Trade Union Council held its opening ceremony this morning. King Emmanuel III personally presided over it and read a proclamation, first stating the process of Italy conquering Abyssinia and establishing the Italian Empire. He continued, "Formerly, the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy, and Italy had no choice but to completely change its foreign policy. Since October 1936, the Italian government has established the closest cooperation with Germany in politics and economics. The Rome-Berlin Axis was announced at that time. This axis is actually vital to the survival of both countries. When the Anti-Comintern Pact was established, the cooperative relationship between Germany and Italy was extended to Japan, Hungary, and other countries. As for Italy's relations with other countries, Italy signed an agreement with Britain on April 16 last year, establishing a good foundation for lasting friendship. We also maintain friendly relations with Albania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Switzerland. As for France, the Italian government notified that country on December 17 last year that it would abolish the Franco-Italian Association of 1935 and explain the various outstanding issues that had temporarily separated the two sides.

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 24th] According to the latest report from Burgos, Franco's troops are scheduled to enter Madrid tomorrow. This morning, Italian newspapers stated that three representatives from the Madrid Defense Council and two representatives from General Franco arrived in Burgos yesterday via commercial aircraft to continue peace negotiations that began in Madrid, aiming for Madrid's immediate surrender to end the war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 24th] According to the "Il Popolo di Roma," a message from Burgos states that a Spanish government military plane landed in Burgos at 10:30 AM on Thursday. Five representatives from Madrid indicated that the government army had agreed to unconditional surrender. Negotiations commenced immediately. The report claims that the representatives included the Western government's Interior Minister and key figures in the Defense Council. They stated that if Franco granted freedom to some leaders of the government army, the government army would proceed with the surrender. Madrid is currently plagued by famine and disease, with 2,000 deaths daily. The newspaper also noted that the government army can only represent Madrid's surrender, as Valencia, Cartagena, and several other key cities have become independent and are no longer under Madrid's command. [Reuters, Burgos, 23rd] According to a Madrid broadcast received here, Madrid is about to surrender to Spain. Italian volunteers fighting in the country are exceptionally brave and have made significant contributions. From now on, cooperation should be maximized. While not believing that peace can last forever, it is hoped that it can be maintained as much as possible. One point must be stated: the expansion of Italian military preparations cannot lag behind others. Regarding the financial situation, although there have been difficulties in the past, they have been overcome step by step thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. We must know that maintaining economic independence is a necessary condition for maintaining political independence. Therefore, we must strive to break free from foreign constraints economically. The King concluded by saying that he had great faith in the fate of Italy and was willing to encourage the people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" reported tonight that Italy's demands for French colonies will be "more aggressive than before," and Germany considers all of Italy's important demands to be as important as Germany's own.

<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 24th] The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated at the Hungarian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee that Hungary is prepared to conduct friendly negotiations with Romania to establish an embassy in Romania through peaceful means. However, he mentioned that Romania did not show a friendly attitude when Hungarian troops occupied Ruthenia, mobilizing a large army. In contrast, Yugoslavia held a friendly attitude.

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] A report from Bucharest states that the new German-Romanian agreement covers a wide range of areas. The main issues of the new agreement are the development of Romania's resources (especially in agriculture) and the supply of industrial equipment. It is expected to expand Romania's production, with grains, oil-producing plants, and hemp as the main products. Germany will supply machinery, and German-Romanian companies will jointly exploit copper, manganese, and lead mines, and establish iron alumina and copper alum industries. A German-Romanian company will also be organized to improve oil production and determine distribution methods. The two countries will adjust their respective industries, establish free zones, and build warehouses in the free zones to store German goods. The agreement includes the supply of armaments to Romania's army, navy, and air force. The agreement will come into effect one month after it is formally signed by the two countries and will expire on March 31, 1944. Unless an objection is raised one year before the expiration date, the agreement will continue indefinitely, with each term being four years. If one party wishes to terminate the agreement, it must notify the other party one year before the expiration of the four-year term.</p>

The agreement is valid until 1944 and aims to establish reciprocal facilities between the economies of the two countries, designate several free zones for Germany to organize transportation companies and warehouses, develop Romania's production, and increase Germany's imports. It is believed here that Romania's cooperation with democratic countries has been interrupted and that it has fallen under German control.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] It is believed here that the German-Romanian commercial agreement has caused Romania to lose its political, military, and economic independence and fall under German control.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 24th] The Hungarian government has issued a communique stating that Hungarian troops have occupied several areas in the Encs Valley on the border between Ruthenia and Slovakia, with the aim of protecting the railway leading north to the Polish border. The communique also confirms that Hungarian troops had local conflicts with Slovak troops in Slovak territory for about a day, stating that a joint committee has been formed by both sides to resolve the issue and determine the permanent border.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 23rd] A communique was issued here in response to Slovakia's protest, stating that the Hungarian government has agreed to conduct an immediate investigation. However, since the Slovak border has never been clearly defined, it is possible that local conflicts occurred between the two armies. It is denied that Hungarian military action was instigated by Germany, which is unfounded.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bratislava, 23rd] Hungarian troops invaded Slovak territory today, attempting to occupy a strip of land about fifteen miles wide. Slovak troops and the Hlinka Guard, along with large bomber formations, fiercely resisted. According to reports, Hungary's move was approved by Hitler. Hungarian troops attacked Slovak territory in three routes, and the Slovak troops retreated to the second line of defense and worked hard to counterattack. It is reported that the Hungarian troops have been repelled. The Slovak Minister of Defense issued a communique stating, "According to a report from the Commander-in-Chief of the Slovak Defense Forces at 2:30 PM, the Hungarian attack has been contained." Hungarian troops have now advanced 13.5 miles. According to military sources, the Hungarian troops clearly want to advance to Iberyes and directly threaten the Polish border. Slovakia has filed protests with Germany and Italy, demanding that the two countries force Hungary to abide by the border. It is also known that Hungarian troops have used tanks and various armaments.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bratislava, 23rd] The Slovak government has lodged a strong protest with the Hungarian government regarding the Hungarian military's invasion of Slovak territory. The protest states that the Hungarian military's aggression is an act that completely violates all treaty obligations and is contrary to the Hungarian government's original intention to recognize Slovakia, demanding the immediate withdrawal of Hungarian troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 23rd] Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky has responded to Slovakia's protest regarding territorial encroachment, agreeing to immediately investigate the truth of the matter and stating that the lack of a defined border on the eastern side of Slovakia may be the main cause of the dispute. Csaky denied reports of Hungarian military action in Slovak territory and said that the rumor that Hungary's move was instructed by Germany is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] According to news from the Slovak capital, the Slovak government has announced that Hungarian troops have entered eastern Slovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] According to the latest news, the response caused by the entry of Hungarian troops into Slovakia is more serious in nature than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Czech Republic, 23rd] The Slovak capital has protested to Budapest regarding the Hungarian military's violation of territory, demanding a satisfactory response within a few hours, and has also reported the situation to Berlin, but it is not known whether it has requested German military assistance. At the same time, Slovak troops have begun to resist the invasion, and the two armies have begun to engage, with casualties on both sides. Aircraft were discovered in the skies over Barad, but no bombs were dropped.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] German officials do not place much emphasis on reports of Hungarian troops invading Slovak territory. It is reported that Hungarian troops crossed the border into certain areas to stabilize Ruthenia. Although the Czechs call it soil, it is still questionable, and it is said that the same trial occurred when German troops occupied the Sudetenland.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 24th] Slovakia has declared that Hungarian troops have invaded its border and has suggested establishing a joint border committee. Hungary has responded, issuing a communique today stating that Hungarian troops have occupied several locations west of the Uzh River in Ruthenia to ensure the safety of the railway. The border between Ruthenia and Slovakia has never been properly demarcated.</p>

<p>According to a Hong Kong report from Minzhong News Agency today, the Siamese government is heavily levying registration certificate fees, forcing many overseas Chinese to return to their homeland. Another group arrived in Hong Kong yesterday aboard the Nanmei vessel, heading back to their native places. According to their accounts, under the current government's [censored], life for overseas Chinese is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Ever since [censored] fascist forces have been steadily penetrating Siam, the Siamese government has, in recent years, repeatedly promulgated various [censored] measures against the overseas Chinese. Not long ago, they even conducted large-scale arrests of overseas Chinese, something that overseas compatriots must still have painful memories of. Whether intentional or unintentional, this policy of serving the [censored] aggressors harms our overseas compatriots and, given the historical position and economic importance of the overseas Chinese in Siam, the Siamese government itself suffers damages as well.</p>
<p>We hope that our government will quickly engage in stern and forceful negotiations with the Siamese government to ensure that the legitimate rights of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam are not trampled upon again. At the same time, we further hope that our overseas missions can be effectively strengthened to genuinely protect the legitimate lives and activities of our overseas compatriots in various regions.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Congratulations on the Official Opening of the Chongqing-Hami Air Route <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Chongqing-Hami air route, which has been in preparation for a long time, was officially launched yesterday. If the weather remains stable, the Ministry of Communications' "Lanzhou" aircraft will fly to Hami today. At the same time, Soviet aircraft are also scheduled to leave Alma-Ata yesterday to fly to Hami. This marks the first official flight of the new Sino-Soviet air route. In addition to celebrating this new success in wartime transportation, we should recognize its significant economic, cultural, and even political implications. Therefore, we dare to anticipate even closer cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union in the future, to jointly oppose [censored] in the Far East and to lay the foundation for world peace. We must do our best to secure this [censored] air route, and we must also make every effort to develop new ground routes!</p>
<h3 id="e41">Schuster's Travelogue (Continued and Concluded) <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the future of Greater Ukraine, Frosson cautiously said: They are conducting a large-scale competition to realize the dream they made in 1918. Although that [censored] dream vanished within weeks, Hitler was indeed their friend, and the racial principles established by the Munich Conference are their charter. But they do not want to be tools of Germany. Britain was also a common enemy with the Bolsheviks, so why can't they be friends with them?</p>
<p>Youth in Training</p>
<p>If the President is gentle and philosophical, then in the "Sick" concentration camp, we can discover a completely different spirit. Here, children of all levels are being trained in Ukrainian history and culture. To the extent possible, they are also taught to use military weapons. Every training method is full of lively military spirit. When we went in to visit, in the dormitory, a large bread warehouse was covered with a lovely floral patterned woolen cloth. The young people sang discordant songs, starting with Nazi-style singing, but later sounding more like better-sounding Ukrainian hymns.</p>
<p>It is said that 12,000 people are being trained in batches every month, of which 2,000 are in Schuster's camp. Some of the young people, who formed the most resilient and courageous part of the concentration camp, still carried the habits of farmers. According to my guide, they were specially recruited from the eastern border region to deal with any eventuality that might come. If the Czech government insisted on appointing Czechs to the Schuster government as administrative officers, my friend said: "We will absolutely not tolerate such officers, we do not want to be ruled by foreigners."</p>
<p>The "Sick" camp's loyalty to the new and expected nation is very fervent. The stories of the oppression of the people in Soviet Ukraine are told vividly, but not in detail. In fact, I found it almost impossible to get the truth about what happened outside the Russian border, even if you tried every method and asked repeatedly from the Baltic states and Romania. What the "Sick" camp hates, and increasingly hates, is the Hungarians, the Poles, and the Bolsheviks; for the latter, they hate not only their "godless communism" but also the long-term oppression of them by the Russians in history. They also mentioned Maizibo.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I did not linger long and immediately took the road to the Czech capital. The nearest station to it is about 186 miles away. Of course, there are already trains there, but the Poles and Hungarians have blocked the railway traffic, and now it is being replaced by state-owned buses. In the bus I was riding in, the passengers were very crowded, about fifteen people were sitting and eight people were standing.</p>
<p>After traveling twenty-five miles on poor ground, the engine showed signs of difficulty in continuing to move forward. Therefore, we took turns getting off the bus and waiting by the side of the road, and the bus disappeared immediately. Every time a truck passed by, two or three passengers would ask to get on the truck. I was unable to follow them, and I was alone. Without a word of Russian, Slovak, or Ukrainian to help me, the situation was very embarrassing. Finally, a truck brought the last few of us to a small town.</p>
<p>A Discontinuous Bountiful Meal</p>
<p>The stationmaster I asked bluntly refused me. Knowing that I was British, he lifted his nose from the two pots filled with meat and sweet potatoes, stood up straight, and said to me in a very fierce posture and with many gestures that even if I stood there and did not leave, he would not lift a finger to help me. He was really too much. The railway he managed was blocked by the Poles and Hungarians, and he could only allow small motorcycles to run over very short distances. His regulated life had become a mess.</p>
<p>I wandered on the road, asking everyone: "Do you speak German?" But after asking for a long time, there was no one. In addition, there was one noteworthy thing - the drummer on the [street] summoned many people to listen to current affairs reports. Then I encountered some seemingly miraculous things. Someone, in answering my question, told me that there was a missionary in this town, and then pointed to me and said: "It is him". This is how I met McGrath, Alexander, who was from Soufloux and came here to help the refugees.</p>
<p>We started together in a small car. The driver was eager to do business and squeezed two more passengers on. There were five people sitting in total. After a while, driven by profit, he couldn't help but stop to solicit a sixth person, he opened the door and waited. Suddenly, a state-owned public well [bus] drove by and broke the open door and footboard, and half of the side [of the car] was destroyed. But this was an extremely fortunate opportunity, because this caused the bus to stop, and Mr. McGrath kindly asked the driver to take me to the army.</p>
<p>From then on, we forged ahead towards Slovakia's Bransa, we got off in the dark from time to time to reduce the weight of the car so that it could pass over the softer ground, or to tow the truck that was stuck in the mud. Fifteen hours after leaving Schuster, I arrived in Bransa. The joy derived from the unwavering experience had completely disappeared at this time, because a German, Slovak, for the sake of pleasing other passengers, threw a long and venomous speech on the unfair trial in Vienna at me, he believed that the British were responsible for this matter.

<h3 id="e42">Siamese Government Heavily Levies Registration Fees; Overseas Compatriots Forced to Return to Their Homeland in Increasing Numbers; Hundreds Have Been Expelled in the Past Month; Another Group Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday; Do Not Lightly Journey Southward Given the Inability to Make a Living Under [Censored] <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Siamese authorities recently amended the Foreigners Registration Ordinance, increasing the burdens on our overseas compatriots and implementing harsh restrictions on the export of overseas children, making it impossible for overseas Chinese to gain a foothold in Siam. Recently, many local overseas compatriots have been expelled and returned to their homeland due to being unable to bear the heavy burdens. Over the past month, ships arriving in Hong Kong from Siam have carried deported overseas compatriots returning home. Statistics show that the number has reached hundreds. Yesterday, the 23rd, another group of Siamese overseas Chinese returned to their homeland aboard the Taikoo Shipping Company's American South vessel, arriving in Hong Kong to wait for ships to return to their original hometown of Shantou. A reporter had an interview to discuss the difficult living conditions of overseas Chinese in Siam after the promulgation of the new regulations, which are recorded below,</p>
<p>The Burdens on Overseas Chinese are Increasing</p>
<p>It is claimed that the Siamese government authorities, through the Ministry of Interior's amended Foreigners Registration Ordinance, stipulated that all foreign residents in Siam, adults, regardless of gender, must pay a registration fee of four baht per year. When the news spread, the entire overseas community was shocked. The Siamese government, since the appointment of Finance Minister Panpalit, had abolished the public service fee from next year, and the general poor overseas compatriots were feeling relieved, but the Siamese government has this registration fee collection, which will make the general poor overseas compatriots feel as burdened as the public service fee. The public service fee was five baht per person per year, but women did not have to pay, while the foreigners' registration fee is not like this. Therefore, if a small family has several parents, brothers, wives and children, they will have to pay dozens of baht a year. This is not a problem for the rich, but the general poor overseas compatriots feel even more difficult. Moreover, most women do not have productive capacity, so paying this fee of four baht, no [censored] added to men, at a time of difficult life and extreme environmental pressure, this unexpected burden is really difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>Poor Overseas Compatriots Forced to Return Home</p>
<p>It is found that overseas residents in migration, the Chinese are the most. Although there are no formal statistics at present, there should be at least 2 million people. Apart from children and disabled people, if each person pays four baht a year, the government will increase its revenue by 10 million baht a year, the large number of which cannot be taken lightly. Moreover, the ordinance also stipulates that any foreigner who is unable to pay this four-baht fee will be treated as a vagrant and deported. At present, the date of implementation of the ordinance is imminent, so most of the poor overseas compatriots feel that it is difficult to cope with and are forced to return home. It is believed that in the future [censored] many others will return home.</p>
<p>Overseas Compatriots Note: Do Not Lightly Journey South</p>
<p>Recently, news came from Siam that the Siamese government will amend the Immigration Law Enforcement Act, and the foreigners' entry tax will be reduced from 200 baht to 100 baht. However, according to various speculations, reducing the entry fee by 100 baht will not increase the number of overseas compatriots going to Siam. The first reason [censored] is that in the current environment, if you enter without a suitable job, you will be regarded as a vagrant and deported. Second, making a living here is not easy. Even if you can land as desired, the subsequent life problem is difficult to solve. Third, the Teochew and Swatow area is now very peaceful and the people can live and work in peace, so there is no need to go abroad. Fourth, the inspection of trachoma is very strict. If you manage to raise a sum of money after repeated preparations in the countryside, but end up being turned away when you arrive in Siam, the result is wasted money and time. The past experience has made many overseas compatriots hesitate to go forward. For these reasons, it is believed that although the Siamese government has reduced the entry fee, the number of overseas compatriots going to Siam will not increase. However, it is found that there are many speculative water passengers in Hong Kong who are luring villagers in the countryside to journey south. It is hoped that the relevant overseas groups here will send letters to those in charge of overseas affairs in the country to explain the Siamese environment to those who are journeying south, so as to avoid unnecessary losses. Otherwise, it is feared that there will be a large number of unkempt and ragged overseas compatriots being deported at the port of Siam.</p>

<p>According to sources from the French Consulate in Hong Kong, the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, along with his entourage, will arrive in Hong Kong from Haiphong aboard the French postal ship "Guangdong." They are expected to arrive around the 27th of this month. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, the ambassador will transfer to Shanghai to inspect the current situation of the French Concession in Shanghai. After completing his official duties in Shanghai, he will also visit Tianjin. The purpose of his mission is to investigate French commercial goods in North China, as the French government is particularly concerned about the situation following the announcement of the abolition of the legal tender by the puppet regime in North China.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Hong Kong Fire Insurance Company Held Annual Meeting Yesterday; Profit of 490,000 Last Year; Lo Man-kam and Others Appointed as Advisory Committee Members <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Fire Insurance Company held its 70th annual meeting yesterday morning in the boardroom of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Chairman Landale, in his report, stated that before proceeding with the normal proceedings, he would like to express the regret of the management and advisory committee members regarding Sir Robert Ho Tung's resignation from his position as an advisory committee member. Sir Robert Ho Tung has guided the company for many years, but due to health reasons, he is unable to continue his service. He requested that sincere gratitude be expressed to him and wished him good health. In addition, it is gratifying to inform everyone that Mr. Lo Man-kam has agreed to accept our invitation to succeed Sir Robert Ho Tung as an advisory committee member of the company. Regarding the financial report, he stated that the profit for the previous year (1937) was $495,866. It is now recommended to pay a dividend of $12 per share, totaling $480,000, and to transfer $15,866 to the insurance fund. The aforementioned surplus cannot be considered small. The typhoon that hit Hong Kong in September of that year resulted in considerable compensation losses for the company. In the past year (1938), there were already $762,452, an increase of approximately $46,000 compared to the same period in the previous year (1937), making it the third-best year in the company's history. Due to the blockade of many ports in China, significant losses were incurred. These unfavorable factors are what I must particularly emphasize. Previously, the business income from places like Guangzhou and Hankou was quite good, but now it has become a drain on resources. The business in Shanghai should still be maintained, but when the earnings are converted to Hong Kong dollars, the loss has reached 75%. The insurance industry, like other industries, naturally has its difficulties during this period. The financial report presented by the chairman was passed by Stephenson and others. The proposal to elect Biass, lawyer Lo Man-kam, Brown, Kinton, Degre, and Williamson as advisory committee members was passed by Armitage and others.</p>

<p>Body Discovered Several Days After Death, Already Decomposed</p>
<p>The ironclad steamship "Sandana" arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Kobe, Japan. En route, a decomposed corpse was discovered in the coal bunker, having been crushed to death. It was determined that the ship had taken on coal in Lukmun on its way north before heading to Kobe. Upon arrival in Kobe, a report was received stating that a coal worker had gone missing during the coal loading process. It was suspected that he had stowed away on the ship, and a full search of the ship was conducted, but to no avail. Later, on Sunday, en route from Kobe to Hong Kong, a cook noticed a foul odor emanating from the coal bunker. Upon opening the bunker for inspection, a corpse was discovered, crushed in the coal. The coal was immediately removed, and it took nine hours to extract the corpse, which had already begun to decompose. The matter was reported to the Japanese consul. It was also determined that on the previous voyage from Calcutta to Hong Kong, a cook had died of illness on board and was given a sea burial.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Kowloon Robbers Becoming Increasingly Rampant; Westerner's Residence on Prince Edward Road Robbed; Three Robbers Claimed to Be Delivering Goods, Tricking Their Way Into the House; Over a Thousand Dollars in Gold Jewelry Stolen; One Suspect Arrested <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>In Kowloon, armed robbery cases have been occurring frequently recently, causing unrest among the residents. The local residents' association has sent a letter to the police authorities, requesting that more detectives be dispatched to maintain law and order. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a Westerner's residence on Prince Edward Road was again tricked into being robbed, resulting in a loss of over a thousand dollars. The homeowner was also injured. One suspect has been arrested after the incident, and two robbers are at large. The police are stepping up their investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tricked Their Way In</p>
<p>The victim was Mrs. Kammis, a Westerner residing at 194 Prince Edward Road, Ground Floor. Mrs. Kammis had been living in Shanghai and only moved to Hong Kong last month. She employs a maid, Guo Liu (37 years old), to assist with household chores. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Mrs. Kammis went out, leaving only Guo at home. Suddenly, the doorbell rang loudly. Guo listened and asked who it was. A man outside the door, holding a package, said that he was a partner from a certain restaurant and was delivering food. Guo, suspecting no foul play, opened the door and let him in. As soon as the door opened, three large men rushed in, all holding sharp knives. They threatened Guo and forbade her from making any noise. They then tied up Guo and gagged her before proceeding to search the house.</p>
<p>Homeowner Wounded by Knife</p>
<p>The robbers were in the house for about 30 minutes. Mrs. Kammis happened to finish her errands and returned home, ringing the doorbell. The robbers heard the sound, remained calm, and prepared for a fight. They opened the door and let her in. As soon as Mrs. Kammis stepped inside, one of the robbers lunged forward to subdue her. Seeing that the situation was not good, Mrs. Kammis turned and ran out, shouting for help. The robber also chased after her and engaged in a struggle. During the struggle, Mrs. Kammis's right finger was cut by the robber's knife, causing blood to flow profusely. She shouted "Robbers!" The three robbers, realizing that they had been exposed and that they had already plundered enough, abandoned Mrs. Kammis and fled in different directions. While Mrs. Kammis was struggling with the robbers, Guo Liu, who was inside, managed to untie the ropes and ran out to help.</p>
<p>One Suspect Apprehended</p>
<p>Xu Song, a partner at the Milk Company branch at 188 Prince Edward Road, suddenly heard the robbery and ran out from the store. By the time he reached Flower Market, two robbers had already disappeared. The remaining robber threw away the knife he was carrying in an attempt to escape, but was caught by Xu and others. They immediately called the police. The police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to investigate. They took the suspect to the police station and sent Mrs. Kammis to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not serious and there was no major problem. The stolen gold jewelry included a platinum brooch with 30 diamonds, valued at $500, a diamond-studded platinum women's wristwatch, valued at $300, and other miscellaneous items, for a total loss of $1,087.80.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Smallpox Spreading Alarmingly! Medical Director Urges Residents to Get Vaccinated Quickly <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Nearly Two Thousand Died of Smallpox Last Year</p>
<p>The spread of smallpox is alarming. The uneven climate of spring is a cause for concern. It is already a matter of indifference whether one is infected. If one is infected, only one in four can be treated by doctors and regain their health. Therefore, the Hong Kong health authorities are paying special attention to this matter. Director of Medical Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, issued a notice yesterday urging residents not to neglect the matter and to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The original text of the notice reads: "In 1938, 2,327 Hong Kong residents contracted smallpox, and 1,811 died as a result. That is, three out of four died. Infants and young children accounted for three-fifths of these cases. Even those who were fortunate enough to survive often had pockmarked faces or even lost their sight. If everyone could be vaccinated and take precautions in advance, this would not happen. You must protect yourselves and your families and get vaccinated quickly. Those who have not been vaccinated within three years should also be revaccinated. Do not delay until tomorrow, as tomorrow may be too late, and you will regret it. If you wish to be vaccinated, you can go to any government hospital, public medical bureau in each district, the Port Health Office at 11 Ice House Street, or the vaccination clinic at the Naval Office on Connaught Road to request vaccination. It is free of charge."</p>
<h3 id="e48">Increase in Heavy Oil Tax to Be Implemented; Gasoline Prices to Soar; Mixed-Brand Oil Has Become a Rare Commodity and Is Gradually Disappearing from the Market <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Following the publication in the Gazette a few days ago that the Hong Kong tax authorities will request the Legislative Council to raise the tax rate on heavy oil to be equal to that of light oil, general gasoline merchants are well aware that this is inevitable. They are treating the original mixed-brand oil (i.e., gasoline distilled from kerosene residue) as a rare commodity. In the market this month, there has been very little retail sale. Currently, the market prices of genuine oil from the three major companies, Mobil, Texaco, and Asiatic Petroleum Company, have also remained firm. The latest market price is $1.05 per gallon, but the listed price is $1.10. According to experienced gasoline merchants, although the Hong Kong tax authorities' move to raise the heavy oil tax to be equal to that of gasoline is intended to protect the operating profit margin of the three major companies, the reduced competition will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in gasoline prices in the future. It is expected that there will be a considerable increase in two weeks. No wonder mixed-brand oil is being regarded as a rare commodity.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Central Government Considers People's Hardships; Tax Exemption for Imported Rice Confirmed; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce and Others Hurry to Purchase Rice to Be Shipped to the Mainland for Price Stabilization <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Gu Yiqun in Hong Kong Planning Food Relief</p>
<p>The rice shortage in Guangdong Province is severe. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are concerned about their hometowns and have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to exempt imported rice from import duties. Until a few days ago, it was rumored in Hong Kong that the Ministry of Finance had approved the tax-free import of 1.2 million metric tons of imported rice. The distribution method was said to be 700,000 metric tons for Shantou, 200,000 metric tons for Jiangmen, and the remaining 300,000 metric tons for public use. As reported earlier, there was no explicit confirmation, which led various overseas Chinese organizations to be skeptical. The Chaozhou Eight-Counties Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong sent a telegram to the Shantou Chamber of Commerce yesterday to inquire about everything. Last night, they received a telegram from Qiong, stating that "the tax-free quota for Shantou is confirmed," proving that the above rumors were not groundless. Yesterday, relevant overseas Chinese organizations such as the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, Heshan Chamber of Commerce, and Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce have begun purchasing rice to be shipped to the mainland for price stabilization. It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Councilor Chen Shouming yesterday, stating that regarding the case of purchasing and transporting imported rice to Guangdong Province, the Executive Yuan has approved the tax-free import of 700,000 metric tons of imported rice through Shantou and 200,000 metric tons of imported rice through Jiangmen. Rice merchants are free to purchase and transport the rice, with August of this year as the period for tax-free imported rice. The Guangdong Provincial Government will supervise the rice merchants to sell the rice at a fair price to prevent speculation. For the above-mentioned tax-free imported rice, the foreign exchange required for the rice purchase should be raised by the shipping merchants themselves. Gu Yiqun, Director of the Guangdong Finance Bureau and President of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing after the closing of the Provincial and Local Finance Conference. He has been in Hong Kong for many days. It is said that in addition to inspecting and reorganizing the Provincial Bank and its branches, Gu is also paying attention to the food relief situation in the province. He will stay in Hong Kong for several more days to plan everything before returning to Shaoguan.</p>

<p>...Since the cholera epidemic occurred in Shantou and other places last year, the Hong Kong government, in order to prevent the spread of the infection, has limited ships from Shantou to first enter the restricted waters. Later, in order to avoid delays, the shipping companies stopped selling third-class steerage tickets, which caused great inconvenience to ordinary merchants and travelers. The Shantou and Jiaying Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong, in order to facilitate travelers, have recently earnestly petitioned the Civil Secretary of Hong Kong to consider the difficulties of merchants and request the Health Bureau to resume the free entry and permit passengers in third-class steerage to disembark without inspection, in order to benefit merchants and travelers.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock last night, the lights flashed and the curtain was drawn, and more than a thousand pairs of eyes were all concentrated on the stage. A three-act national defense drama with profound significance changed and proceeded on the tortuous plot.</p>
<p>The scenery, lighting and makeup are quite exquisite. It's just that the night scene of the third act, for a while, was so dark that the audience couldn't see it at all. I don't know if it was intentional or unintentional. In short, the quiet order was also disrupted in an instant.</p>
<p>Each actor's lines are very well prepared, and everyone is very focused and hardworking. The only shortcoming is that girls play male roles in terms of appearance, words, and actions. There are many places that need to be exerted, but they are not strong enough. This is an inevitable problem for general girls' schools to perform dramas. It also tells us a very simple truth: male roles should be played by men, and female roles should be played by women. Drama is originally a manifestation of real life, and it is not easy to imitate the real thing vividly and vividly.</p>
<p>The plot of the prologue in the first act did not leave any special impression. In the second act, when revolutionary groups collectively criticized, jointly planned, and struggled with × people, they gradually became nervous. At the same time, in addition to drama propaganda, it can also receive the side effects of promoting collectivism and self-education.</p>
<p>The war scene with × people in the third act was very tense, but unfortunately the performance ××××× was not strong enough and not realistic enough. It was really too preferential to × people. If men and women were to perform together, this act would definitely have greater gains. In the end, our army exchanged the freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation with a heroic sacrifice. At ××××××, our great and brilliant national flag fluttered!</p>
<p>——Everyone stood up to salute in joy!</p>
<p>The majestic and moving song of salvation sent the guests out of the venue in droves. A touched heart was still beating nervously!</p>

<h3 id="e54">Hong Kong Women's Great Solidarity: A Review of Women's United Work – Let us Expand Women's National Salvation Work with Collective Wisdom and Effort! <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese women residing in the bustling and extravagant Hong Kong, influenced by the prevailing atmosphere, have earned a well-known name both domestically and internationally: "Miss Hong Kong." Foreign friends often consider them interesting figures to discuss. However, the cannons of the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident shattered their illusion and propelled them to participate in various national salvation efforts, contributing what they should to the arduous War of Resistance against Japan. This proves that Hong Kong women are not merely individuals who indulge in frivolous entertainment and adornment; they are equally capable of performing the work that daughters of the motherland can do!</p>
<p>Following closely on the heels of the Lugou Bridge Incident that initiated the War of Resistance, the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association was established. Many of its members were renowned women from Beijing and Shanghai residing in Hong Kong, as well as leaders in Hong Kong's women's circles. The president was Madam Chen Shuying, wife of Sun Ke, and the chairperson was Madam Zhang Leyi, wife of Song Ziwen. Subsequently, the China Women's War Disaster Relief Association, presided over by Madam Liu Qingxuan, wife of Tan Shifan, and the Hong Kong branch of the Women's Work Committee of the Guangdong New Life Movement Promotion Association, presided over by Madam Ma Fengqi, wife of Wu Tiecheng, along with other women's national salvation organizations, were also established one after another, actively participating in national salvation work. This truly reflects a shining moment for Hong Kong women. Due to the public's enthusiastic expectations for women's national salvation organizations, everyone further demanded that they unite swiftly to achieve more significant and effective results. However, this proposal ultimately failed to materialize due to environmental obstacles.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Women's Comfort Association, the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, the Women's New Life Movement Association, and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), four women's national salvation organizations, united due to the needs of their work and formed the Four Women's Joint Association. They decided to hold joint meetings every two weeks to exchange ideas, enabling them to maximize the effectiveness of their collaborative efforts. During the first joint meeting, Madam He Xiangning attended and proposed three pressing issues that needed to be resolved: promoting domestic goods, training cadres, and actively advancing the women's labor literacy movement. Later, the formation of the Domestic Goods Promotion Group, the holding of the Domestic Goods Exhibition, the establishment of the Four Women's Propaganda Training Classes, and other meaningful initiatives can all be said to have originated from this association.</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival of the 26th year (of the Republic, 1937), a commemoration was held at the South China Athletic Association Stadium on Caroline Hill, with the participation of over twenty organizations and thirty schools, creating a lively atmosphere. Subsequently, the commemoration of the March 8th International Women's Day and the March 12th memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the 27th year (1938) achieved excellent results. These were all initiatives promoted by the core members of the Four Women's Joint Association.</p>
<p>Following closely the unfolding of the war, the Wartime Children's Relief Association of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers Fighting Against Japan was established in Wuhan, providing shelter for all orphans of soldiers and homeless children in war zones. Branches were established one after another in various places. The General Association then sent Madam He Xiangning, Madam Wang Xiaoying, and Madam Hu Mulan to collaborate with the Women's Joint Association to begin preparing for the Hong Kong branch. By mid-May, preparations were declared complete, and relief work gradually unfolded. The first home in Yuen Long, as well as the second and third branch homes, were established one after another, sheltering Guangzhou refugee children who had escaped from the bombing flames, as well as refugee children and infants from Hankou. Currently, the new site for the relief home is under urgent construction and is expected to be completed soon. In the future, it will continue to shelter refugee children from war zones and preserve the national spirit, training future warriors for the new China. This should be a special contribution to the motherland!</p>
<p>During May of last year, the enemy crazily bombed residential areas in Guangzhou and the transportation lines of the Yuehan and Guangjiu railways. Corpses of citizens were exposed for miles, and homes were reduced to ruins. Those who were spared from the brutality fled to the countryside or came to Hong Kong in droves. Along the skirts of the roads, refugees wandered and lost their homes, belonging to the roads. As a result, the Four Women's Joint Association, together with various organizations in Hong Kong, promoted and organized the Hong Kong All-Circles Joint Relief Association for South China Refugees, providing relief to refugees in various parts of South China and Guangzhou, especially those provinces that suffered from enemy bombings. The recipients benefited the most. The number of medical supplies provided to various ambulance teams and service groups was also not insignificant. In addition, on the anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance Against Japan and National Founding last year, a vegetarian food fair was held; on the anniversary of the August 13th Songhu War of Resistance, a donation drive was held; and the charitable sales and donations of street vendors also emerged at this time. This movement caused a sensation throughout the country and was extremely enthusiastic. Following that, there was the large-scale flag donation campaign during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the 27th year (1938). These were all meaningful activities that caught the public's eye. In these activities, women's organizations contributed significantly.</p>
<p>At this time, on the war front, the enemy was fiercely attacking the Nanxun Line. Many of the commanders on this front were brave generals from Guangdong. In order to comfort the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines and strengthen their combat capabilities, the Four Women's Joint Association also promoted and organized the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Group to the North. The comfort group, which had a sacred mission, included students, young ladies, school principals, and even married women who wore black rubber shoes and carried copper helmets, marching along the dusty roads. This was such an exciting event! The comfort group played a significant role when it reached the battlefield, inspiring the soldiers, who were so moved that they won a victory the very next day. It also encouraged other women's organizations in other regions to go to the front lines to provide comfort. This is truly a source of pride for Hong Kong women!</p>
<p>All of the above sacred tasks are good manifestations of the unity of Hong Kong women's organizations. This proves that as long as there is unity, any difficult and arduous task can be solved easily. Naturally, contrary phenomena such as infighting and friction are still unavoidable. However, considering that this was the first time that Hong Kong women had united and cooperated in an unprecedented way, the achievements they have made are already remarkable. However, we should not be overly optimistic. Our work is still far from sufficient, and there are many other tasks that urgently require women to undertake. Therefore, further cooperation is necessary among the women's national salvation groups in Hong Kong. Thus, at the general assembly on March 8th International Women's Day, Madam He Xiangning immediately proposed the formation of the Hong Kong Women's Organizations Joint Assembly. At the same time, Madam Soong Ching-ling also had a deep hope for the unity of women.</p>
<p>As the War of Resistance enters a more difficult stage today, women's organizations in Hong Kong really should no longer hesitate. They should quickly hold hands tightly, intensify their efforts to shoulder various unfinished tasks, and further promote the spirit of overseas Chinese women in Hong Kong. Two days ago, at the closing meeting of the March 8th Festival, this proposal to form the Xiangjiang Women's Joint Assembly was enthusiastically supported by everyone. We look forward to this joint assembly发挥ing a greater working effectiveness!</p>
<p>Finally, we offer a station of advice with the utmost sincerity: First, our unity must be thorough and consistent, not just a momentary burst of enthusiasm. Second, whatever personal opinions or rifts may have existed in the past should be quickly eliminated in the work of unity. Third, expand the effectiveness of our work with collective wisdom and effort in sincere unity. If we can achieve these things, the future development of the Hong Kong Women's Joint Association will be limitless!</p>

<h3 id="e55">Our Counteroffensive in the Southern Battlefield is Imminent; Enemy Aircraft Frenziedly Bomb in an Attempt to Threaten; After Several Months of Adjustment, We Have Reached Completion; Enemy Aircraft Run Rampant in the Lower West River and Northern Guangdong <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the North River] In the Southern China theater, there has been no major battle for several months. However, both sides are seizing this opportunity to urgently replenish and reorganize, actively preparing for the arrival of a major battle. It has been learned that our counteroffensive military operations in the Southern battlefield, after several months of adjustment and deployment, and the recent decisions made at the Southwest Military Authorities' meeting, have reached completion. The date for the overall offensive on Guangzhou City is not far off. According to reports, the head of the Guangdong bandits heard of this and is extremely fearful, showing signs of restlessness. Therefore, they have been frequently mobilizing and constructing fortifications at various strongholds in an attempt to strengthen their defensive capabilities for stubborn resistance. Furthermore, they are employing the deceptive tactic of "advancing in retreat," actively sending troops to harass us. According to military intelligence, the Guangdong bandits, in order to contain our military advance, have been implementing a policy of indiscriminate bombing for the past ten days. Large numbers of enemy aircraft have been frantically bombing various parts of Guangdong province. Heshang, Gaoming, Zhaoqing, Sihui in the lower reaches of the West River, and Qingyuan, Yingde, Wengyuan in northern Guangdong have all suffered brutal bombings. On the 21st and 22nd, enemy aircraft again launched separate air raids on northern Guangdong. It has been learned that on the morning of the 22nd, the sky was overcast. A squadron of nine enemy aircraft took off from Guangzhou, flying north along the Yuehan Railway, first circling over Huaxian and Juntian for a long time for reconnaissance. At around ten o'clock, they passed over Yinzhan Ao and went straight for Yingde. At the same time, a second batch of four enemy aircraft continued to take off, heading directly north, flying low and strafing with machine guns near Yinzhan Ao. At eleven o'clock, the two batches of enemy aircraft merged and flew northeast. Half an hour later, they returned to Yingde, dropping more than ten bombs in the Lidong Hengshi area. The losses are unknown. After the enemy aircraft acted violently, they turned south and left. It has also been learned that the people in various parts of northern Guangdong, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices due to the continuous and indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, have been evacuating themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Huang Gu Takes Command of Four Districts; Defense of Leizhou is Further Consolidated; The Qiongya Guerrilla Force is Gradually Expanding; Collecting Refugees from Xuwen, Requesting Resettlement <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuwen] Since the fall of Hainan, the districts of the Leizhou Peninsula have been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, and enemy warships have been cruising offshore, posing a threat. Xuwen is the first to bear the brunt. However, our military and civilians have a high awareness of resistance and are spirited. Huang Gu, commander of the newly formed XX Division, has been appointed commander of the four districts, making every effort to reorganize the defense. On the one hand, he is taking in refugees who have escaped from Qiongya, and relief organizations are separately providing assistance and resettlement. Public order in Xuwen is still good, and inspections of entrances and exits are particularly strict to prevent evil people from leaving traces. Many of the refugees who have fled here are not familiar with the inspection regulations, and some complain about the harshness and detail. The various organizations have requested the defending army to provide convenience to the refugees.</p>
<p>Military Preparations in Leizhou are Fully in Place</p>
<p>The reporter once went to the command to visit Commander Huang, but Huang was out inspecting the defense. According to a senior staff officer of the department, the enemy has been spreading the idea of invading the Leizhou Peninsula for more than a day. Our military strength in Leizhou is strong. Although the land is coastal, it is different from the isolated island of Qiongya. The terrain is favorable to us. Attacking Leizhou and invading Guangxi is easier said than done. There are three reasons why the enemy cannot invade: (1) manpower does not allow it, (2) geography makes it impossible, and (3) supply is difficult. The enemy cannot break these three points, so there is no way to have the conditions for combat. Our military deployment in Leizhou has been in place for a long time, and all preparations are complete. The only fear is that the enemy will not come. The enemy's invasion of Qiongya is nothing more than a threat to the international community and a hasty attempt to seek peace. After the strategy failed, they began to clamor for invading Leizhou and Guangxi, which shows its impossibility even more.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Teams on Qiongya Island Unleash Their Power</p>
<p>The reporter continued to inquire about the situation of the guerrilla forces on Qiongya Island. The staff officer introduced the reporter to Wang Yifeng, a wealthy merchant who had just escaped from Qiongya Island. According to Wang, after Qiongya Island fell, Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang, who was originally stationed in Wenchang, led his troops to carry out guerrilla warfare, while mobilizing the armed forces of the people. The strength of the guerrilla force grew stronger with each battle. The enemy occupied the coast around Qiongshan and Haikou, but they were never able to penetrate deep into the interior as far as Wenchang. After the enemy entered Wenchang, our troops dispersed and operated in small units. On the 12th of this month, they reorganized and annihilated 300 enemy cavalrymen near Sanjiang (the midpoint of the Haikou-Wenchang Highway). After this battle, more and more people joined the guerrilla force, reaching more than 20,000 people. They also became more skilled in the use of guerrilla warfare. The main reason why the enemy cannot penetrate deep into the central part of Qiongya is the surprise attacks by our guerrilla forces. Regarding the statistics on the number of refugees who have escaped from Qiongya Island, the reporter investigated various parties. In addition to those who have gone to Nanyang and Hong Kong, there are about 3,000 people currently staying in various districts of Leizhou and Guangzhou Bay. In addition to the local charitable organizations providing assistance, they have also consulted with wealthy Qiongzhou overseas Chinese in other ports to donate funds to send all the refugees to Yunnan Province for resettlement as a fundamental solution. At the moment, this proposal has been suspended. The relief organizations are discussing sending telegrams to Song Ziwen, Chen Ce, and various prominent fellow villagers, requesting that the resettlement be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e57">On the West River Front, a Small Encounter Occurred Between Us and the Enemy; More Than Ten Enemy Soldiers Were Killed; One Enemy Motorboat Was Sunk <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the West River] The West River front has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday (the 19th), several dozen enemy soldiers in six motorboats approached Jinli from the Makou direction for reconnaissance. Our troops waited until they were about 50 yards from Jinli, and then opened fire with machine guns, killing more than ten enemy soldiers who fell into the sea. The remaining enemy soldiers, seeing that we were prepared, dared not approach the shore and fled back the way they came. In this battle, more than ten enemy soldiers were killed and one enemy boat was sunk.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Military Situation in Guangdong is Rapidly Unfolding; Large Numbers of Eastern River Troops are Reinforcing the Defense; The Enemy Pontoon Bridge at Shilong Was Destroyed by Us; 200 Enemy Troops Harass Hengli and Changping <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the East River] Since the highest military conference in South China decided on the overall plan for our counteroffensive against Guangzhou City, the deployment and distribution of military forces in the east, west, and north have been carried out in accordance with the plan. It has been learned that General Commander Wu Qiwai of the Ninth Group Army has already actively planned for the eastern front, and the entire line of military operations has entered a new stage. The various situations obtained are listed below:</p>
<p>The Main Counteroffensive Force Continues to Move East</p>
<p>It has been learned that after General Commander Wu Qiwai of the Ninth Group Army was ordered to lead his troops back to defend the eastern front, in addition to the XX Army under Ou Zhen, which had already moved south and reached its destination, the XX and other units were still on their way back due to the need for replenishment. General Commander Wu believed that the military situation on the northwest rivers had been deployed, and the counteroffensive order could be issued quickly. Therefore, it was necessary to quickly complete the eastern front line to wait for orders to advance. He specifically telegraphed the various units in the Central Plains to rush south. It has been learned that a certain unit that recently arrived in Guangdong has departed from Jiangxi and arrived in Longchuan Xinfeng, rushing east to split up and reinforce the front lines of Zengcheng, Boluo, and Dongguan, pressing toward the enemy.</p>
<p>The Fourth District Holds a Guerrilla Conference</p>
<p>Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla Column, recently went to a certain place in the North River under orders to attend the provincial guerrilla war zone administrative conference. He has now returned to a certain place in the East River after completing his official duties. Commander Wang, in order to instruct his subordinates on the progress of the conference and to determine the political work and enemy annihilation plans for the guerrilla zone in the future, has scheduled a meeting of county magistrates and team leaders in the district within a week to thoroughly improve the guerrilla warfare plan and political education issues in order to enhance the basic strength, improve combat capabilities, and assist the regular army in winning the counteroffensive. The location and time of the meeting are confidential and have not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The Enemy Pontoon Bridge at Shilong is Destroyed</p>
<p>Since the Fourth District Guerrilla Force was reorganized, its momentum has been enormous, and its range of activities has gradually expanded. It has launched surprise attacks on the enemy several times, inflicting heavy losses. Furthermore, the XX Brigade under Yin Zhongming of the district learned last night (the 21st) that the enemy troops in Shilong were lying dormant in the town due to continuous rain. Therefore, they secretly went to the riverbank south of Shilong Nanbian in the dark of the moon and rain, and destroyed the newly completed pontoon bridge built by the enemy. At that time, several enemy sentries were shivering and guarding the bridge. Yin's unit took them by surprise and killed them with bayonets, and destroyed the pontoon bridge. Currently, due to the destruction of the bridge, the highway from Shilong to Guancheng cannot be connected.</p>
<p>200 Enemy Troops Harass Hengli Again</p>
<p>According to another military dispatch, the enemy troops stationed in Shilong have been harassing various villages lately. Although they have been punished repeatedly, their ambition to promote their political propaganda plan has not diminished. Yesterday (the 23rd), they again sent more than 200 infantrymen with two cannons to harass the villages of Changping and Hengli. In addition to looting food and livestock, they continued their consistent policy of forcing the village chiefs to accept fake orders, establish local maintenance societies, and levy military pay. They withdrew to Shilong at around 3:00 PM. However, the people of our various villages all deeply understood the great righteousness and vowed not to be humiliated, unanimously rejecting the enemy's orders. It has been reported that the Fourth District Guerrilla Command has again increased the deployment of a certain unit to the area of Hengli and Changping, and ordered the newly appointed Changping District Chief and Police Chief Zhu Weishen to earnestly protect and lead the people in the area to avoid being used by the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e59">More Than 300,000 Miao and Yao People in Guangxi Participate in the War of Resistance; After Several Years of Strict Training, They Have Now Become a Strong and Vigorous Army <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou Bay] The Guangxi area is mostly mountainous, so the Miao and Yao peoples are concentrated in the mountains, numbering more than 300,000. These Miao and Yao people have long been isolated from the Han people, so they are not often mentioned in the same breath as the Han, Hui, Mongol, and Tibetan peoples. However, if one examines the history of the Yellow Emperor's battle with Chi You in Zhuolu, it can be seen that the culture of these Miao and Yao people, who created a thick fog to intimidate the enemy, is not low. Later, they migrated and moved, and then lived for a long time in the deep mountains, isolated from the Han people. If they can be organized, given good training, and their intelligence and physical strength developed, they can enrich the ranks of the War of Resistance and make a great contribution to the country and nation. Therefore, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Guangxi Provincial Government authorities have been working hard on this. A special normal school training institute has been established to train Miao and Yao ethnic teachers, so that after graduation, they can go back to train and organize the education and culture of their ethnicity. In these two or three years, the best of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups have been selected and trained into more than thirty types, totaling more than a thousand outstanding young teachers. Others, such as Yao, Black Yao, Ling, and Dong, have also selected young people to participate in training. The students are between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four, mostly around twenty years old. According to the students' level, they are divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Books and clothing are provided by the school. The educational policy is to emphasize both teacher training and intellectual training, with educational principles, national language, arithmetic, hygiene, rural technology improvement, and the improvement of the students' lives. The aim is to first improve their lives and then extend it to political training and cultural development. A large farm has also been opened for students to practice on. Currently, the students of these more than 300,000 Miao and Yao people can all write very fluent Chinese characters and speak very fluent Mandarin. Young men and women over the age of fourteen can also perform the most accurate and skillful shooting methods, so they have now become a new and vigorous force in Guangxi's war of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Enemy is Pulling New Tricks Again, Urgently Seeking to Prosper Guangzhou, Holding Registration of Shops and Land, Wanting to Lure the Bourgeoisie Back to the City <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiangdou] It has been more than five months since the violent enemy luckily occupied Guangzhou. They have already designed all kinds of ways to prosper the market. At first, they used poisonous means, opening opium dens, casinos, and brothels to attract the people. Therefore, most of the rogues, hoodlums, bandits, and other riffraff also followed their example. Then, they forced the shops to open and sold enemy goods at low prices. Therefore, some small merchants were forced by the environment to return to the city. Therefore, for several months, most of the residents of Guangzhou have been propertyless classes in rags and tatters, and bandits who live by looting. There is absolutely no prosperity to speak of. According to recent news, the enemy chiefs feel that Guangzhou has not been able to prosper because the bourgeoisie and legitimate merchants have not returned to the city, social finance is exhausted, and order is disrupted. Recently, they have changed their tricks. In addition to instigating traitors to lure our people to certain ports and villages, they have also established a so-called "Property Registration Office" by the puppet court to conduct the registration of shops and land. After registration, the shops must all be occupied by someone. The deadline is the end of April. Shops that are not registered or are not guarded will be confiscated and nationalized. The attempt is to attract our people with property back to the city. Fortunately, most people with a little property have national and ethnic concepts. Since Guangzhou has fallen into enemy hands, everything can be sacrificed. They do not care about the existence or destruction of their property. Therefore, not only will they not return to the city to apply for registration, they will not send people back to the city to guard the shops, so as not to increase the number of docile subjects.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Special Shipping News <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Kin Shan of the Hongkong Canton &amp; Macao Steamboat Co. is now scheduled to depart for Canton on the 28th of this month at 9:00 a.m. and return to Hongkong on the 30th at 9:00 a.m. The passenger procedures are the same as last time. The ship will resume service to Hongkong and Macao on the 1st of next month.</p>
<p>The Franconia of the American Red Star Line left New York yesterday on its eleventh round-the-world voyage. It has now been learned that the ship has arrived in Singapore and has proceeded to Hoi An, and is scheduled to arrive in Hongkong on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>The Far East Line ships of the Italian Postal Shipping Company had only one or two ships sailing several years ago, but in the last six months, the number has gradually increased. Currently, it has been learned that the ships under the company's banner are the Chindwara, Conte Verde, Conte Biancamano, and Victoria. The route is from Italy, via Genoa, Port Said, Naples, Mumbai, Colombo, Manila, Hongkong, and Shanghai. Recently, in order to expand the company's Far East shipping business, it has specially dispatched the Giulio Cesare from next month. It has been learned that the Cesare is a new ship with an exceptionally attractive interior, weighing 21,900 tons, with a displacement of 27,432 tons, a length of 633 feet, and a width of 76 feet, and can accommodate 150 first-class passengers and 441 second-class passengers. The ship will depart from Shanghai on May 18th of this year to return to Italy, via Manila, Singapore, Colombo, Mumbai, Mogadishu, Port Said, Naples, and Genoa, and the entire journey will take about one month.</p>
<p>In addition, the company's Victoria arrived in Hongkong from Shanghai yesterday and is expected to arrive at the Kowloon Wharf Bridge at about 7:00 a.m. this morning. It will depart for Europe at 4:00 p.m. this afternoon, via Manila, Sitou, Mumbai, Colombo, and Geneva.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Enemy Intentions are Unclear; Enemy Warships Leave Qionghai and Head East; Enemy Military Losses in the Invasion of Qiongya are Heavy; Military Expenses for Two Months Consume 2 Million <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Beihai received here reports that the eighteen enemy warships surrounding Qiongya suddenly gathered at Haikou yesterday (the 21st) and then sailed east, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beihai] After the enemy occupied Haikou, in order to make up for its military expenses, it has ordered the puppet organization to levy various taxes. The enemy's military losses in the capture of Qiongya are extremely heavy. According to a precise estimate, the total number of enemy troops deployed in various places is about 10,000. The military expenses for these two months include 600,000 yuan for food and supplies, 300,000 yuan for replenishment, 700,000 yuan for ammunition consumption, more than 100,000 yuan for the construction of fortifications, and medical expenses of 100,000 yuan. Other transportation expenses are not included, and the total amount has reached 2 million yuan. On average, about 1 million yuan is needed each month. Even with active taxation in Qiongya, it cannot make up one-tenth of the total amount of military expenses lost.</p>
<p>Film and Theatre</p>
<h3 id="e63">After Arriving in Hollywood with Five Hundred Dollars: Continued from Yesterday <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>An opportunity arrived, and I began my journey on the path to fortune. He clearly saw my excitement, smiled, and invited me to dine at the Brown Derby restaurant. He said his female companion would arrive soon. However, his girlfriend never appeared, which didn't matter much. But when it came time to pay the bill, he was somewhat embarrassed; he had forgotten his money. I happily lent him three dollars to cover the bill for two cocktails and two meals. Afterwards, I quickly ran back to the apartment to tell them about the appointment for tomorrow.</p>
<p>"What did you say his name was?" one of them asked me. I somewhat boastfully showed her the business card. They passed it around, each silently understanding something. Finally, a tall blonde woman said, "Of course, you paid for the meal..."</p>
<p>These three dollars went into my "experience" column. Such scams aren't common in Hollywood, but newcomers are often the victims. The next day, I tentatively went to the address on the business card, only to find a pile of junk. I now had only one thing to do: buy a few things.</p>
<p>Evening dress... thirty-five dollars</p>
<p>Makeup box... eight dollars</p>
<p>They laughed at me for buying such an expensive makeup box. It was a small green tin box, like a fishing tackle box. One of the women explained that it was worth only two dollars at most. However, they had nothing to say about the evening dress; it was very beautiful. I felt this dress distanced me even further from my homeland.</p>
<p>A month passed, and one day, I assessed my current situation and became somewhat anxious.</p>
<p>Waiting for opportunities in places frequented by film people was costly and yielded no results. Not even a glimpse. Dining in those famous restaurants cost at least one dollar, plus tips, which was another big expense, because everyone tipped with flair. I went about three times a week. I also attended a premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, paying five dollars for a ticket and two dollars for a flower, but I wasn't noticed. I visited numerous talent agencies and saw eight agents, all of whom rejected me due to my lack of experience. I wrote fifteen heartfelt letters to fifteen directors (which sank without a trace). I loitered, either standing or sitting, in front of various theaters, studios, hotels, and restaurants, all public places. I consulted with the women in the apartment. Whenever a new film began production, I would rush to the studio to find a way in. I stopped directors on the street and spoke to strangers who looked important—but these actions only seemed to make me a conspicuous, pitiful, and repulsive person. Everywhere I went, I met with a polite but firm rejection. People in Hollywood are very, very busy, and I don't have any special talents that make me more valuable than Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, or Norma Shearer. I'm just one of many thousands, a very ordinary one at that.</p>
<p>Every trivial thing made my hopes even dimmer. The apartment was also constantly changing. Today, this woman had great hope; tomorrow, it was someone else. "Agnes's screen test wasn't good... Mary went back to marry her boyfriend next door... Qin waited six months for a screen test, but failed... Betty pawned all her belongings..."</p>
<p>As for me, after a whole month of effort, I was two hundred forty-six dollars and fifty-five cents poorer.</p>
<p>The first two days of the second month were uneventful. On the third day, there was a slight earthquake that broke a few window panes and toppled some chimneys. This minor event was blown out of proportion by the sensationalist newspapers. I immediately made a long-distance call home to tell them I was okay, to prevent them from rushing over in tears to find my body in the ruins. That one call cost four dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, the first car payment was due, and I paid twenty dollars. The car company's warranty against breakdowns had also expired. As if the car were deliberately trying to cause trouble for me, it broke down the next day. The car company wasn't responsible, so I had to pay for the repairs myself. That was another four dollars and sixty-three cents.</p>
<p>After a good cry, I spent three dollars on some stockings, and things seemed to improve. Wei Yun, one of my roommates, invited me to dinner with her and a female friend (who was a friend of an acting coach). This was a great opportunity, so of course I went. Fortunately, this person seemed to like me and accepted my invitation to dinner the next day. The next day, I spent another five dollars at Bickford's, but it was worth it. She finally agreed to introduce me to the acting coach.</p>
<p>This person also liked me and took me to dinner, introducing me to a female secretary of a producer. She took me to a preview screening and introduced me to an assistant director. After all the introductions, I finally had some hope, but it cost me a lot of money: lunches, dinners, cocktails. However, it was beneficial. I never let my distinguished guests (or perhaps victims) off easily. Each time, I subtly hinted at my hopes: "I want a screen test."</p>
<p>One day, this assistant director heard me say it too many times and got a headache. He suggested that I should first join a small theater to act. He said, "Talent scouts often go there. As long as you stand out, they'll come looking for you. For you, I'll even get a director to come and watch you perform."</p>
<p>So, I began to look for these kinds of small theaters. I ran into a lot of obstacles. It seemed there were hundreds of people looking for the same kind of work as me. I realized that very few theaters actually paid actors. Most of them relied on subsidies from writers, who paid to have their scripts performed in the theater, or unknown directors who paid to direct, or unknown actors who paid to act. In a word, their purpose was only to attract attention.</p>
<p>I also paid twenty-five dollars to get a role in the world's worst opera, under the direction of the world's worst director, with a group of the worst-managed actors. During the three weeks of rehearsals, the director couldn't even tell the left from the right of the stage, and the male lead almost broke my neck in a love scene due to excessive "effort."</p>
<p>In addition to the twenty-five dollars mentioned above, this also cost me a lot of money. I rented a long, black wig, a grass skirt, and a lei.</p>
<p>The good times didn't last long. On the afternoon of the official preview, the assistant director called and said that the director had gone to Santa Barbara to shoot on location and wouldn't be back for two weeks. But our play was only running for one week. It was terrible, a waste of effort.</p>
<p>The performance also went terribly. I performed in that awful play for seven nights. The audience each night was suspicious; they were probably relatives of the actors or people with other connections. In any case, they weren't outsiders. Even so, after watching one scene, they all expressed some dissatisfaction. After seven days, I resigned and spent a day reflecting on the illusion.</p>
<p>I only had seventy-five dollars left, and my brain was empty. Hollywood lived up to its reputation; it was indeed not easy to break into, especially for someone like me. I gradually began to hate Hollywood.</p>
<p>When I had only one dollar more than the price of a ticket home, the landlady came to tell me I had a phone call. Her voice didn't have anything particularly exciting about it, but my legs trembled, and my heart pounded. It was him, the assistant director.</p>
<p>"Hello, are you... are you the one who asked me for a screen test... are you still here... hello, hello... I thought I wouldn't be able to find you. I showed your photo to the boss, and he wants to see you. Can you come in twenty minutes? Bring that black evening dress... can you make it... hello..."</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I had another flat tire. To get to the studio, I'd have to call a taxi, which would cost about three dollars. This meant that going to the studio would require using the money for the train ticket. This was tantamount to cutting off my lifeline to home. Dozens of women who had had screen tests before were still waiting for another chance. And this was only my first time.</p>
<p>Did I call the taxi after all?</p>
<p>Guess.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Whether to Subdue the Dragon Hinges on This Move: South China Goes All Out to Pounce on the Stubborn Team; Eastern's Battle Against US Military Is Also Fierce <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special Report) All those concerned about soccer events have been discussing the South China vs. Kowloon Football Club match in recent days. Because South China is crossing the sea north to do battle, the terrain is unfavorable; the slightest mistake could lead to failure, hence the worry over whether South China will be able to defend itself when subduing the dragon.</p>
<p>Kowloon rarely leaves its home base and acts like a local tyrant, its might terrifying. Many have lost color in the face of this team, perhaps not knowing how much strength they possess. Many have sacrificed themselves to its claws, and view its soccer field as a formidable path. Even with South China's strength, it could not win the special silver shield rematch there previously, achieving only a draw. It was only when they left the Kowloon field that they were eliminated. This shows how important the terrain is.</p>
<p>Today, the stubborn team, undefeated on its home field, welcomes the visiting team with the highest hopes of winning. One relies on the advantage of the terrain, and although it is defending, it wants to display its strength. The other relies on its superior skill; if it passes this hurdle, its future will be bright. Therefore, this competition will be fierce and certainly not a waste.</p>
<p>What Kowloon is fighting for is to maintain its undefeated record at home. What South China is fighting for is the glorious championship. Although the meaning of the fight is different, the goal of victory is the same.</p>
<p>The reporter, based on the facts observed during the South China vs. Eastern silver shield semi-final last week, in which South China marched in the rain and defeated Eastern, believes that all of South China's players are able to use their true skills and are not controlled by the environment. Today, they also possess this spirit, so victory is not difficult. It is hoped that today's weather will be like the intermittent rain of the Eastern battle, which would make victory even more assured.</p>
<p>Discussing the weather issue, some may find my words inappropriate. The majority believes South China is skilled in short passes, and that fighting in the rain is not suitable. How could I consider it beneficial? Do I alone have a superior view?</p>
<p>What I am referring to is specifically fighting in the rain on the Kowloon field. Because Kowloon relies on the advantage of the terrain, if it rains today, the field will be wet and the ball heavy, and their accustomed steps will lose their regularity, and there will be no terrain advantage. Conversely, South China's players, because they are experienced, can control the ball well, and are not greatly affected by the rain. Therefore, my thoughts are a reversal based on the situation.</p>
<p>With the championship in sight, one more step to reach hope, South China players, good luck! If you break this stubborn team today, no one will dare to take the league champion position.</p>
<p>The Eastern vs. US Military match is also important. If Eastern wins, it will have hope for second place, and then it can profit by watching how South China and the Navy perform afterwards. The lineups for the South China and Kowloon teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(South China)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, King's College held its 9th Annual Sports Meet at Caroline Hill. There were many participants and the results were excellent. A total of three school records were broken: (1) Senior Long Jump, (2) 110-meter Hurdles, (3) 1,500 meters.

It is noted that the school has won a total of three relay championships this year, with satisfactory results. After the competition, the awards were presented by Mrs. Sulingdun, the principal of King's College.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Special Report] Although the Hong Kong Interport Football Team has not yet reached the point of setting off, everything is ready and the candidates have already been decided.</p>
<p>Before the Hong Kong Interport Team went to the Philippines, it happened that the Singapore China team came to Hong Kong from the Philippines. Such an opportunity is rare, so the Football Association specially consulted with South China to change the two games of the Singapore China team in Hong Kong to be played by the Hong Kong Interport Team. It is said that the Hong Kong Interport Team's lineup for the match has been planned as follows:</p>
<p>(Eastern)</p>
<p>Tan Junqian</p>
<p>Shi Han, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Yi Shilan, Bilu, Feishi</p>
<p>Du Houchengtao, Zhi Gaoshan Nu, Du Li Huitang, Wo Ge Ni, Da Yanba Chen</p>
<p>The above lineup is to cope with the Singapore China team and is only for practice. As for the official lineup when they go to the Philippines in the future, it is what the general concern about the football affairs wants to know. According to reliable sources, the Hong Kong Interport team will send the following personnel to the first battle in the Philippines:</p>
<h3 id="e70">Exciting Soccer Match: Li Wah Cup Final Tomorrow Wah Luen vs. Western Members at Hong Kong Club Field <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Report] The Li Wah Cup Football Final will be held tomorrow afternoon at the Hong Kong Club Field. Two famous actors will take the stage to perform, which will surely cause a sensation.</p>
<p>Li Huitang made great contributions last time, and this time he was re-elected, which greatly strengthened the attacking power of Wah Luen's forwards. I once said, "He will definitely be happy to personally accept the glory of the award," and this will be guaranteed to be realized tomorrow. If you don't believe it, wait and see.</p>
<p>The strength of the Western Members does not seem weak, and with Gao Shannu as the forward, it is not to be feared, but compared to the whole team, there are many places where it is not as good as Wah Luen. Let's see Wah Luen win the championship. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<p>— Lai Duannan</p>
<p>I have been engaged in sports writing for nearly twenty years, and I have seen many intense sports events, but I have never seen a soccer game as tense as this year's. What is even more exciting is that not only do Chinese and Western soccer teams in Hong Kong have extremely fierce battles, and the league is in a tug-of-war, but also that Lidu in Shanghai won the Scotto Cup as a third division soccer team in the league. Also, the Hong Kong basketball league, the Xingdao team, which had a great reputation, suddenly lost to Zhong Sheng, and after that, it will become an unprecedented spectacle of competition, oh, magnificent, sighing and laughing.</p>
<p>Secondly, in recent years, Hong Kong football has repeatedly opened unprecedented and unique spectacles. After Colingdon arrived, the Saigon team followed, and this year, the Philippines also came to play an unprecedented Hong Kong-Philippines international game. Not long after, the Singapore China Progressive Association team also came, and at the same time, there was news that Lidu planned to come to Hong Kong in early May. From then on, thousands of fans will be like being on the Shanyin Road, with no time to see everything.</p>
<p>Promoting sports requires money, and Hong Kong sports developed the earliest in the Far East, especially the lively soccer games. However, although the Football Association has decades of history, it still feels financially lacking, which is a pity. It is said that this year, because Li Qiguai made a comeback, the Hong Kong-Philippines game had a large appeal, and the income of the first game exceeded 8,000 yuan, and the income of the three games exceeded 10,000 yuan. Now, the Eastern vs. Navy runner-up final, which seems to be realized soon, will also be added. The Football Association may use one-third of the income of this game to increase its revenue. Also, South China's sudden defeat to the police in the league will certainly add a lot of income to the special silver shield final game. The Football Association's surplus is soaring, and Hong Kong football will be even more prosperous because of it.</p>
<p>Li Huitang sent a letter to Sangyu, saying that the new wave does not push the old wave, so that the "outdated old man" is still superior to everything, which is a feeling of emotion, not self-promotion. Looking at the rising stars in the football world today, some have a skill or strength, and they are immediately arrogant, or once they are praised by the newspaper, they are immediately arrogant. From then on, they focus on complacency, and if they show their ambitions to others, they will have no progress because of this difference in thought, and instead feel decadent. This is the most undesirable phenomenon. People then blame us for not praising too much. However, our responsibility is to promote, not to belittle. If the players have self-awareness, how can they seek improvement? What's more, if we criticize more than praise, those who are competitive will hate us for no reason. If we criticize correctly, people will hate us and even ask unreasonable questions. Although we don't care, it is difficult for the writer. But I hope that the younger generation must seek a way for the new wave to push the old wave, and not be concerned with temporary false reputations, then our country's sports will be reliable.</p>
<p>A week ago, some people thought that soccer teams could not avoid suspicion under intense competition. From this, they speculated that Eastern might not go all out when fighting the Navy, and that South China might not seek a stable victory when fighting the Navy after winning the championship. This is no less than worrying unnecessarily. Now the facts tell us that Eastern's generals fought the Navy, and all the injured generals came out, and they still won in the end. South China had just been defeated by the police, and it had to strive for victory against the Navy. The theory of suspicion has been broken down, and the glory of the Chinese taking the championship and runner-up is in sight, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>Putting oneself in a dead end and then being reborn is the secret of using troops. South China often has the disadvantage of underestimating the enemy, and in the dark, it still deliberately plays tricks, so that it accidentally loses to the police, so that it strives for self-reliance. Then South China's recent defeat is really a blessing to South China. It is expected that the championship will reach three championships (League, Special Silver Shield, Xuhe Cup), two kinds because of its defeat on the Boundary Street field.</p>
<p>In the basketball league, there has been no new show of replacing the old for many years, and the technical level of Hong Kong has not been able to surpass it. Now, Zhong Sheng, who once lost to South China, suddenly defeated the multi-term champion team Xingdao, then Xingdao will definitely not dare to despise South China in the future, and there are still strong Eastern and Pui Ying, which can pose a great threat. Others such as South China and the police are not easy to deal with. The road is full of thorns, so the training of the Xingdao team will definitely be more diligent, and they will no longer dare to underestimate the enemy during the competition. This alone is enough to show that future events must be fierce. If so, the improvement of Hong Kong's basketball level is in this, it is in this. If we further seek a more perfect management organization, I know that with our "Guangdong spirit," we will definitely not be inferior for a long time.</p>
<p>Since Xu Weipei's sudden rise in tennis, there has been no successor. As a result, the competition for the championship has returned to the point where it is predetermined before the game. Once entering the third week of the game, the viewers can no longer see new faces, and there is a feeling that it has been the same for more than ten years, which is not a blessing for the tennis world. This year seems to be slightly more lively, with Gao Shannu and Ding Ding Leimi Di winning Hui Huizhao and Qian Cha in doubles, university medical student Lin Tiande's entry into the third week, Cai Yongshan's narrow victory over Da Linzhen, Li Huitang's Yao Dezhu's fierce battle against Lin Zhen's brother, and both brothers are invaluable new spirits. However, is it possible for the championship to change hands? Is Xu Runpei's art already overwhelming his brother's qualifications? It is still a big question. Because Da Xu has no opportunity to travel, although he has innate talent, he has not been able to develop to the international level. Runpei, who is young and promising, is also in danger of the same fate. I am very sorry for it. How can my wish to win the horse lottery in the end come true, and self-fund those like the Xu brothers to seek art abroad to honor the motherland? There are many rich people in our country, why is there no one with the same feelings as me? It is sighable, it is sighable.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Artillery and Engineering Units Desire to Participate in the Upcoming First Division League: Discussion on Promotion and Relegation Issues <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] It is remembered that during the 1935-36 football season, the number of teams participating in the First Division League set a new record, totaling thirteen teams. Consequently, the schedule was extended, starting in mid-September 1935 and ending in mid-May 1936.</p>
<p>Football is a strenuous sport and not suitable for summer. Therefore, the English Football Association stipulated that each tournament must end within the first week of May. All rules and regulations for organizing tournaments by the Hong Kong Football Association are based on and implemented according to the guidelines set by the English Association. Therefore, before the start of the 1936-37 football season, to prevent the schedule from being extended, it was resolved to end the tournament within the first week of May and to limit the number of teams participating in the First Division League to no more than twelve. This rule is still in effect today.</p>
<p>In the past two seasons, the number of teams participating in the First Division League has not exceeded the limit. However, it is unknown what will happen in the upcoming season. Yesterday, the reporter learned that the Fifth Artillery Battalion and the Twenty-Fourth Artillery Battalion, which have achieved considerable success in the Second Division League this season, intend to unite and participate in the First Division League under the name of the Artillery Battalion. The Western Engineering team also has this idea, but it is unknown whether the Association will approve their application.</p>
<p>It is also remembered that when the Association resolved to limit the number of teams participating in the First Division League to no more than twelve, it also included a clause stating that any Second Division team that achieves excellent results during the competition and wishes to be promoted may be given the opportunity by the Association after considering the situation. Since the number of teams participating in the First Division is limited, what will happen if a strong Second Division team is accepted for promotion, causing the number to exceed twelve? Will the established limit be overturned? If such a situation does occur, the Association has the right to accept a strong Second Division team for promotion and also has the right to relegate the team with the worst performance in the First Division League. Therefore, if the Association allows the Artillery Battalion and the Western Engineering team to be promoted to the First Division in the upcoming season, the team that finishes last and performs poorly in the First Division this season may be relegated.</p>
<p>However, the team that finished last in the First Division this season is undoubtedly the Hong Kong team. This team holds a significant position in the history of Hong Kong football and is also known as the "gentlemen of football." The current chairman of the Association, , is a key figure within the team. Although the team's performance has been extremely poor this season, it has a good reputation. If the Association enforces the rule of relegating the team with the worst performance in the upcoming season and applies it to this team, it is believed that it will not be effective. As for the St. Joseph's team, which is one place ahead of last place, although their performance is not good, they have good talent, and most of them are representatives of the Portuguese team in international competitions. The Portuguese team has qualified for the finals, and with this fact, there is no reason to relegate the St. Joseph's team. Therefore, whether the Artillery Battalion and the Western Engineering team can be promoted in the upcoming season is quite questionable.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the football movement in Hong Kong has developed considerably. In principle, the Association should not restrict the number of teams participating in the First Division too strictly. Nominating fourteen teams would not be too many. The Association was established to promote football, so it should support players in advancing towards technical excellence and not suppress them. If the Association feels that the schedule is too long and unsuitable, it can start the tournament earlier. I wonder if the gentlemen of the Association will agree with me. (Stadium Tycoon)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Essays and Personality <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Gao</p>
<p>Qin Gui and Yan Song committed the crimes of harming the loyal and bringing disaster to the country and the people. Even their essays, as precious as pearls and jade, were subjected to capital punishment and could not be "preserved in famous mountains and passed on to future generations." Zhou Zuoren, in Peiping, had some suspicion of being a Han traitor in his actions. Many middle schools in Shanghai removed his works from the Chinese textbooks, although his personality had not yet reached the stage of "final judgment."</p>
<p>If the saying "A gentleman does not abandon words because of the person" is to be believed, I feel sorry for people ancient and modern. Judging essays by essays, I have "no way to see" the great works of Qin Gui and Yan Song! I have always had a "high mountain to look up to" for Zhou Zuoren's essays, and I still hope that he can prove his pure personality with strong facts.</p>
<p>Because of the perversity of conduct and the baseness of personality, essays are implicated. The general public believes that this is a kind of punishment, depriving him of his spiritual property and causing him more profound pain, whether dead or alive? It also contains the meaning of killing a chicken to scare the monkeys, so that talented scholars dare not follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not so. Art cannot be separated from life, and works are entrusted to personality. Painting, sculpture, and music are all like this, and literature is even more obvious. It must exist in the heart before it can take shape on the outside; it must have a "compassionate heart" before it can write the supreme essays of the world. Han Yu said: "The so-called essay must have something in it, therefore, a gentleman is cautious in reality, and the beauty or ugliness of reality cannot be hidden when it is expressed." Tolstoy directly believed that art must be "for life," or even not limited to art. He said: "The prerequisite for all sincere occupations is not love for work, but a love for humanity that must be loved. This work cannot be loved without the belief in improving humanity. Only those who fill their minds with love can do valuable work." You think, just this general kindness and compassion, loyalty and enthusiasm, is enough to illuminate eternity; and what about those with keen eyes, transcendental insights, and artistic skills, who express them in essays, naturally have an incredible power. With this power, they arouse the resonance of mankind; with this power, they promote reforms in politics, law, morality, and thought; with this power, they universally save the masses from deep water and fire. This is why Tolstoy is Tolstoy, and similarly, this is why Gorky is Gorky, Romain Rolland is Romain Rolland, Confucius is Confucius, Mo Di is Mo Di, Han Yu is Han Yu... Then, we know that establishing words must be based on establishing virtue. "Preserving it in famous mountains and passing it on to future generations" cannot be achieved by chance.</p>
<p>The most taboo thing in art is hypocritical expression. One does not drink alcohol, but wants to play a few songs of drinking wine. One indulges in wild drinking and drunkenness. One is extremely enthusiastic, but wants to play a high tune of fishing and woodcutting. One's chest is full of selfish desires and evil thoughts, but one wants to talk about moral righteousness and saving the people, etc. If "rhetoric does not establish sincerity," how can there be good essays? Even if one has "writings that fill the body," it is only a temporary addition of many imitation pearls and many rough products to the universe, not precious jade, and cannot be passed on to future generations.</p>
<p>Even if his writing skills are very clever and can deceive the eyes of everyone in the world, his hypocritical life will sooner or later be exposed, especially in the time of "severe winter." Once exposed, the essays of "words not from the heart" and the "moment of expensive paper in Luoyang" are over, and they are still not worth half a penny, serving only as waste paper. No matter how lifelike the actor on stage plays Yue Fei, he cannot be pointed to as a national hero.</p>
<p>I deeply hope that young people who aspire to literature and art, in addition to devoting themselves to the cultivation of skills, will devote themselves to the cultivation of a great personality and a fulfilling life. With kindness and compassion, loyalty and enthusiasm, write essays of true feelings and true nature, for themselves who have not lived in vain, and for the Chinese nation that is fighting against resistance and building the country!</p>
<h3 id="e81">"The Usefulness of Scholars" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Ge'er</p>
<p>"Scholars are useless," the "uselessness" of cultural people is obviously not like this now. "Life begins with the confusion of recognizing characters," therefore, "characters" really cannot be "recognized." This is a clear annotation of "Scholars are useless." Everyone knows the "uselessness" of "confused" people.</p>
<p>Now is the time of resistance against Japan. "Throwing the pen and joining the army!" is admired by everyone. This shows that the "pen" is ultimately inferior to the "gun," another clear proof. Therefore, some people criticize cultural people who make great arguments in newspapers and magazines, and cannot help but despise them, saying: "If you have the guts, go to the front line. Talking incessantly in the rear is oral resistance. This is the degradation of cultural people!" Therefore, "scholars" are still "useless," but the tone has changed.</p>
<p>However, are "scholars" really "useless"? I say "yes," and also "no." Isn't this contradictory? In fact, all things in the world are contradictory. There is a "good" side, and there must also be a "bad" side. There are "useless" "scholars," but it cannot be denied that there are also "useful" ones. Otherwise, why would Mr. Lu Xun study medicine so well, and then abandon medicine and engage in literary and artistic work? Just with a copy of Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" in my hand, it is said to be an "enlightenment" for young Russian women in the 19th century. This is only in the field of literature and art. It is also true in other social sciences.</p>
<p>To deny the uselessness of cultural people, to despise the "pen" and value the "gun," it can be said that such people only have one eye and only see one side of all things in the world, and it is necessary to correct this.</p>
<p>In fact, some cultural people are indeed useless. What they write is not only useless to the country and society, but harmful. This can be said to be above "useless." There is also a kind of "bookworm" who holds books and reads dead, chewing on words, with a "scholarly air." The saying "Life begins with the confusion of recognizing characters" is really appropriate for them. Because such people only see the "dogmas" in books and do not see the turbulent world outside of books, they use "dogmas" to measure the turbulent world. Therefore, their eyes become blurred, and they feel a little "confused." If Mr. Dong Hong looks at modern women from the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius, he will definitely be "confused" and will definitely "begin to worry," and he will inevitably shake his head and sigh: "The world is going downhill."</p>
<p>Such "cultural people" can be said to be "useless." And I think that resistance against Japan does not need to seek any help from such "cultural people." However, this is only the "bad" aspect, and to deny the combativeness of all cultural people from this "bad" aspect is either "ignorant" or somewhat "malicious."</p>
<p>The Guilin telegram of the 15th of this month said that General Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Military Affairs Headquarters, hosted cultural circles on the 14th. During the meeting, he gave a speech, the gist of which was: "The nature of this war against Japan is resistance against aggression and defense against invasion. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the method to win depends on total war in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. The work of cultural people, although biased towards the rear, is no less helpful to the War of Resistance than the heroic warriors who shed blood in the front." The "usefulness" of cultural people can be said to have been clearly demonstrated by General Bai. General Bai also pointed out that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, we will take a defensive posture in the military field and an offensive posture in the political field. Therefore, this shows that the pens of cultural people can be said to be one of the most excellent weapons in strengthening the spirit of the nation.</p>
<p>We will not be "useless" "doctors," nor will we be "confused" by recognizing characters. We will not listen to other people's "nonsense." We will pick up our "pens" and display our fighting spirit. In short, we are "cultural people" who are no less than the heroic warriors who shed blood on the front lines!</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Singing Procession <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Chengsheng</p>
<p>Here, I don't often hear children's songs.</p>
<p>Children's songs do exist: however, without rhythm, without beat, without the ability to stir my soul, it's as if I haven't heard them. They often just hum a few lines on the road in twos or threes; they may not be students, right? I see several times they are shoe-shiners. No one gives them practice, and humming a few lines is still learned from self-imitation. Naturally, this is an angry expression for them. ——Probably they have already traded begging-style servitude for the sustenance of a day's life.</p>
<p>I don't often hear children's songs, but in my mind, the resounding echoes of children's melodious songs occasionally burn.</p>
<p>Three months ago, in the countryside, I encountered a glorious festival. The night sky in the countryside seemed particularly bright early. Waking up, the clock struck four. The air in the ancestral hall was very fresh and seemed clear. A primary school nearby blasted out "My × people are as fierce as wolves, seizing my land." In the silent space, the singing seemed particularly cheerful and resonant, stirring beautiful echoes in the surrounding wilderness. The drooping golden ears of rice in the fields outside must be bathed in the cool autumn breeze, bathed in the sound waves of the singing. The cool breeze and singing, like a pair of butterflies, flew across the golden felt of the fields. The dense sorghum and millet must also be starting a moving dance, right?</p>
<p>Village children. At the time when city people are sound asleep, they get up and move their voices. This day is the most glorious festival of Greater China. The children's hearts leap with hot excitement. They want to use the dawn's roar to express their love for the motherland, for their hometown. The singing is higher and higher pitched, with occasional soft and melodious pauses; you can hear that there are still adults leading the singing, perhaps even holding a small baton to beat the rhythm, directing, right? However, there is no accompanying piano music. The village primary school is poor and cannot afford an organ, let alone a "Pianola." But what does this matter? Every word and every sentence clearly and uniformly reverberates, becoming a small rhythmic tide, sometimes surging, thundering, sometimes subtly sinking down, flowing to the distant places. Who says village children are stupid!</p>
<p>I got up, and my friend got up too. We threw on our pajamas and walked out of the ancestral hall, deeply breathing in the "morning air." ——That can only be called "morning air." It is refreshing, but not gentle, assailing your nostrils. The breeze wrinkles the pond water in front of us. In the distance, there is still a hazy mist, unable to see the famous Centipede Mountain on the opposite side. The singing seems to never stop. This time, it is not just in the small school here reverberating. Over there, vaguely, there are rhythmic sound waves coming. Looking far away, there is clearly a faint light flickering. Is it a small lantern? Over there, it is clearly a swaying lantern: not only lanterns, but also a line of short, dark figures wriggling. It's children again. They are coming from all directions.</p>
<p>We crossed the village gate, carefully stepping on the mud road: the dew was not dry; it was slippery. I remembered that we should bring a flashlight: but my friend insisted on walking like this, saying that even if we slipped, it would be an unforgettable memory of this festival, filled with strangeness and joy. Finally, we arrived at the head of a bridge, and a beautiful picture unfolded before us. The eastern sky had a hint of dawn. On four or five field paths, children formed single-file lines, with one at the head carrying a lantern, leading. The rice plants were tall, and their bodies were small, only half their waists visible, winding forward in the golden straw. You could hear them singing about defending China, singing about the singers of the masses, singing about the national general mobilization, and singing their most familiar "My enemy is as fierce as a wolf." Most wonderfully, there were probably stone slab roads there. Besides the singing, you could also hear the children's clogs, "tuk-tuk-tat-tat," like the clacking of castanets.</p>
<p>We didn't know how many "armies" were coming towards us here. We were still wearing pajamas, not very presentable—— they were so solemn! Almost threatened, we wanted to retreat from the head of the bridge; but they all "opened" up and came. Coincidentally, the "five armies" almost converged on that side at the same time. Two of the roads first turned into one road, four teams turned into a long dragon, punctuated with light, singing the same song——of course, the most familiar "My enemy is as fierce as a wolf," crossing the bridge. The lanterns were raised high, illuminating us, seeming to want to see our faces clearly, truly embarrassing. ——They were so solemn! We could only applaud them, but we didn't sing along with them. Several of the children stopped singing, looked at us with hazy smiles, and all went to that small school. The eastern clouds began to shoot out brilliant red light.</p>
<p>This was three months ago; but a vivid impression still remains in my mind, occasionally the enthusiastic singing of that group of children still echoes. I came here and occasionally listen to the songs of the shoe-shiners. That place, in the thick and thin smoke of war, has forfeited a lot of its essence; those rice fields must have been harvested already, right? In the soil, only the dead roots of rice straw remain. The cold wind blows up dust, a bit desolate and sad, right? All the middle schools have dispersed, but the gates of the primary schools are still wide open. I believe that group of children is still there singing "My enemy is as fierce as a wolf!"</p>

<p>We grieve and rage at the fall of Guangzhou,</p>
<p>If we do not recover Guangzhou, how can we face the revolutionary martyrs?</p>
<p>Today, we are in a faraway place,</p>
<p>Let us offer our respects to the sky!</p>
<p>Undying loyal souls of March!</p>
<p>We vow to continue your great spirit,</p>
<p>And rebuild China's beautiful and splendid mountains and rivers.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>She silently stared at his dark figure, wanting to cry, but unable to.</p>
<p>"It's too cold outside, you should put on more clothes!"</p>
<p>Still silently staring at his dark figure—as if he were the source of all human misfortune.</p>
<p>"You can take some necessary little things. You love to play the piano, right? Take your sheet music!"</p>
<p>She was slightly surprised. She thought:</p>
<p>"You bandit, do you even know about sheet music?"</p>
<p>Then, she asked him:</p>
<p>"Have you ever studied?"</p>
<p>"Idle talk!" he thought. He said: "Hurry up and find what you want to take!"</p>
<p>So, she went to the table, opened an iron box, and immediately closed it; there didn't seem to be anything she needed there. When she opened a small box on the ground, there was a metallic sound. He took out a flashlight from his pocket and shone it. He bluntly asked:</p>
<p>"Is it a gun?" (Seventeen)</p>
