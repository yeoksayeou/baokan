<h3>目前財政金融經濟問題　論第二次地方金融曾議的成就</h3>
<p>二期抗戰開展以來，軍事方面，政治方面，都已發生新的變化，財政經濟問題更被提到一個嚴重的階段。而急需應付的困難，第一是稅收問題：我國歲入向以關銳，鹽說，統稅三種間接稅佔最多數，約為歲入百分之七十以上。但自抗戰以後，天津，上海，青島，廣州，漢口等重要口岸與經濟中心的相繼陷落，其他港口亦被封鎖或在擾亂之下，因此對外貿易受到障碍，關稅收入，大受影響；長蘆乃兩淮等地鹽區被×佔領，全國鹽稅亦蒙相當捐失；而沿海工業中心相繼淪陷或被擾亂，使統稅收入亦復激劇降低。其次是外匯問題：×人為圖破壤我國法幣制度，曾設立偽準備銀行發行僑鈔，以僑鈔吸收法幣換取外匯，至最近並於本月十五日實行佔領地區禁止法幣流行實施統制外匯，其所以破壞我幣制增加我外匯困難者，種種卑鄙手叚，可謂無所不用其極。第三是物價問題：自從主要通商口岸相繼喪失以後，各地物價，便劇烈地呈現剪刀形的變化，一方面是一切入口品的激漲，另一方面是農產的價格，因不能靈活輸出外地而慘跌；因此戰時國民經濟所受不利影響，實屬不堪數計。此外由於抗戰發展結果，各地交通運輸更形困難，國家財政經濟與國民經濟生活及生產事業等，亦受相當嚴重之不利影響，對淤整個民族的抗戰建國大業，都是異常嚴重急待解决的問題。</p>
<p>財政部之於日前召集第二次地方金融會議，其主要任務在於謀求地方金融機構之充賓，業務之擴展，中央與地方之密初合作，以期協助生產事業，發揚地方金融力量適應抗戰建國新階叚之新需要；而其所以謀求解决二期抗戰財政經濟問題的意義，尤為不容漠視的。</p>
<p>此次會議已於本月十日閉會，並於十五日發表宣言。我們對於最高領袖與財政當局的領導精神，和各地經濟金融負責人士於奉命之後，不分遠近，不避艱險，赴渝集會，以盡戰時各界人民天職的精神　謹致萬分熱摯的敬意。而對於此次會議的成就，與會後之期望，亦願披瀝所見，以供參攷。此次金融會議討論主題，係針對目前階段財政經濟上之重要問題，而討論所以增加生產，促進輸出，平衡物價，接濟民食，開發富源等等方案，更進而研究戰時金融上經濟上彼此聯繫，互相合作，藉以策動我國金融總動具，運用全民族的經濟力量，粉碎×人封鎖經濟破壞金融的陰謀，以求達到抗戰必勝建國必成之鵠的。會議依據抗戰建國綱領，五中全會及參政會三屆大會决議的基本方針，就各地特殊環境與條件，結果對於原定任務，大致均已决定具體辦法，製定各種方案。其中尤其值得重視的，是下列各項：</p>
<p>第一是堅决認定『經濟動員係近代戰爭取决勝負的要件，而金融機構之健全組織，業務之調整推進，又實為加强經濟爭取必勝的基本』。所以决定到會各人囘到各地，盡量的發揚各地金融力量，推動各地經濟發展，即集中各地分散的經濟力量，以助中央財政金融種種政策之成功。而對於如何抵制戰區×偽鈔券的行使，防制戰區物資之被利用，及平穩戰區以外地方物價，發展生產事業，集中民間分散窖藏的金銀等，亦有具體的决定。第二是堅决認定『金融事業的盛衰，其利害係整個的：過去各地金融業容有專顧一省一行之利害而未留意于全盤的情勢，實為使國案金融經濟政策不能貫澈的主要原因』，所以决定各地金融業今後應一致遵照國家整個的政策邁進，向民族整個的經濟推動，而省與中央，省與省間，省與縣鄉間，更當進一步的聯系，排除隔閡，通力進行。實可謂為建立金融界抗日統一戰綫的一個主要决議。第三是堅决認定『要向×人的後方爭取經濟上的勝利，其首當在控制戰區經濟中心，鞏固戰區經濟壁壘，』所以决定各地金融業者必須一致努力，先使戰區內同胞經營各業，能使我們得到經濟上或金融上的便利，而在戰區內的物資，得以盡量吸收，供我輸出；人員需要，得到充份供應。第四是堅决認定最高領袖所指示的『×人封鎖我經濟，便是我經濟復興的機會』，為國家復興經濟的基本原則。且决定各地金融界當更以集合的力量，以不斷的努力，使內地經濟，在最短期內，分工合作，迅速復興，並使　礦工商各業，得有充裕資金的供給，以改善其業務，藉使各部份生產事業，能於最適合我現在經濟條件經濟環境下得到最大的繁榮及最速的增進，此外，該會並在宣言中明自表示兩點：一為關於地方金融，决定實心遵奉第一次金融會議宣示的改善地方金融機構辦法綱要，五中全會通過的調劉地方金融辦法，戰區財政金融與經濟處理辦法種種方案，以及國民參政會三届大會關於財政經濟妁决議，一致努力，更求進一步具體的實施。一為關於爭取國外援助，决定今後各省各地方金融機關，應各盡所能，各秉天職，在最高領袖所詔示及中央當局所啟迪的原則下，協同邁進，以期獲得友邦更多的合作，俾我經濟復興亦能更加迅速。</p>
<p>我們深信經過此次金融會議之後，我國二期抗戰中的財政金融經濟問題，必能獲得相當程度的解决。不過我們為使這種問題的澈底解决，而真正達到全民族金融經濟力量總動員以為抗戰建國服務這個鵠的，似乎還應要求全國人民與政府，以更大的努力，實現以下所舉幾點　即第一，我們要完善達到「有錢出錢」的要求，堅决擴大所得稅，實施遺產稅，提高一切奢侈品的稅率，同時取消苛雜和攤派制度，以舒民力而利稅收。第二，要以政治動員和政府法令相配合，擴大徽募公債和献金運動，並發動人民自動捐錢助粮，供給抗戰軍隊，充實財政收人。最近重慶獻金運動，已有極好成績，其中尤以女界，献金異常熱誠；我們認為只要宣傳得宜，動員得好，這種運動實為帮助國家今後財政經濟政策順利實現的一種重大力量，所以應該在政府統一的領導下更廣泛推進，尤其是海外僑胞方面。第三是推進節約運動，尤其致力於中產以上人士過去一切腐化生活的改善，限制他們的浪費，提出他們一切浪費的金錢，作為對於民族國家的献金。同時注意（一）厲行廉潔　動，改訂薪餉辦法，按照最低生活標準規定平等的薪餉制度；（二）廢除封建的浪費的習俗，改良社會風氣，不僅為國家財政保存元氣，並可預為未來建國樹立基礎。第四是要加緊擴大國際宣傳，爭取外債，及其他實際的援助。此外，關於發展生產建設事業，建立新的經濟中心，我們認為尚須往力於以下各點，即（一）國家銀行應擴大辦理低利借貸，協助生產事業的發展及商品的流通；（二）繼續堅持消滅×人破壞法幣政策的鬥爭，同時協助被隔絕區域設立地方銀行，發行地方紙幣；（三）保護私人工商業的自由營業，同時往意發展合作事業；（四）今後生產事業應側重於抗戰軍事必需的國防工業和戰時人民必需品工業，同時改良勞工法及工廠管理制度，保障生產工人的物質待遇，以便生產率的切實提高。</p>
<h3>各國在華投資展望</h3>
<p>— 良辰譯</p>
<p>譯者按：原著者為Ner　Man　Hanwell，原文豋『亞洲雜誌』為上海密勒氏評論報（第九號一九三九年一月廿八日出版）轉載。著者以為中日戰事有三個可能的結果：第一個是日本完全征服中國。著者以為這是不可能的；第二個是日本佔頒一部份中國土地後，即　時的武裝休戰，但中國必然要繼續　戰，直至收復失地而止的；第三個是中國獲得最後勝利。在第一第二兩可能的結果中。外國在華商業是沒有前途的，只有中國抗戰勝利，外國在華投資始有利可圖。由此，可知中國抗戰勝利不但是中國國民日夕析　的事，而且　外國資本家所樂聞的。外國資本家看清楚，只有中國獲得　後勝利，他們在華投資才有希望，因此他們為了自身利益計，必然的將盡可能的　助我國的。</p>
<p>目前的中日戰事雖距結束期甚遠，但已經有人討論到將來的問題。尤其是關終外國企業在將來的復興建設中所扮演的角色。中日兩國都沒有充足的資本來從事建設，所以外國投資者所佔的地位似乎是很重要的　這好比歐洲受了上一次世界大戰的摧殘後的情形一樣，如將過去的加以檢討，同時分析當前的動向，那麽　可大致地預計外國投資者的可能　將來。</p>
<p>先假設將來日本獲得勝利　這設想作者　為不會成為事實的。然而若干人以為日本雖必喪盡元氣，但勝利將仍屬於她的。如結果果是這樣，那麼除了日本以外的國家會有什麽投資或貿易的機會呢　日本的經濟組織，戰前本已不健全，而現在更因戰爭的生長而致筋疲力盡，當然只能撥出一極小部份的資本來從事復興，然而，以資本供給日本使她剝削中國人民是否外國投資者的福利呢？</p>
<p>中日戰爭的結果大抵是如此：關閉了外國直接投資的門戶。這從日本建立新的企業和擴展原有的　業可　出來。地些誇大的計劃多半從東京來的，目的是要建立起各方面的獨佔的體制，這不　　預先驚告那些要　進中國境內的非日藉投資者，而且嚴　地威脅着那些在陷于日人手中的中國士地上有長久歷史的外國企業。內河航行權現在只是日本輪船公司始能享受，除了强迫現存的中國企業寶行『中日合作』外，日人又在中國建立了巨大的新的股份公司，華中開發公司的資本共一萬萬日元，『為了公共福利和發展工業』它有權來投資及調劑各企業的金融。　寥所謂　業是包括運輸交通電力煤氣自來水礦產水產及『其他有關公共福利的　業』。一個較大但相類似的組織又在華北建立起來，資本是三萬九千萬日元。明顯地，這些包合一切的半官式的組織只作產生如在　滿　國　內一樣的大規模的獨佔而已，情形是這樣，這都能怪外國商人們感覺在日人佔領區內投資是不可靠的呢？</p>
<p>很多人覺得假如日本獲得勝利，最使外國在華商業敗壞的預示，是使華幣與日元發生聯系的企圖，這是有充足理由的，華幣如依附日元集團，則外國將被迫放棄一大部份現有的對華貿易。兩國的貨幣發生聯系後不可避免的會施行經濟的　理和限制，那時外國的貿易便會衰落下去。　正如某政論家所指出的：『嚴密的限制和政冶的統治所生的結果就是外國在華商業的不幸。』從日本以外的國家進來的入口貨物會受抑制，目的是要維持管理的通貨。這樣便給予日本貨物很好的入口機會。還有，根據已經宣佈的在戰後向中國要求賠欵的　序，足以預示中國的出入口貿易將受日本嚴厲的　佔管理。</p>
<p>間接的投資或者會有較好的希望，那就是以資本供給這些龐大的日本獨　企業。日人曾努力吸引外人資本以開發『滿洲國』，日人這種企圖將來會用於開發華中和華西的。自群，不少日人覺得如要完成他們的　　，就有吸引外資的必要。在華　一大規模的企業的領袖曾這樣承認：『上海與華南的經濟發展是需要巨大的投資的。日本自身沒有這麽大的力量，所以希望能得到英美法的低利資本』。相問的言論實在多得不勝枚舉，而且無疑的是出於至誠的，不用說，並非所有日人都有這樣的意見。剛才說過的那位企業領袖亦承認這點。他說：『有些日人反對利用外資，因投資者　往有過份的行動。』又說：當這些外國投資者過份行動的程度過大　『我們　設法將情形加以改善的』。日人對外國投資的這種限制只是使投資者在未投資以前不能不躊躇考慮一下吧了。如日本的獨佔破　外國商業時，甚至上海的「死硬派」也會這樣想：『如要外國竇本家眼巴巴的望着他們的利益被破壤，同時又以資金幫助日人去剝削他們的利益是不可能的。』</p>
<p>我們發覺不少的有勢力的日人堅决的主張在華投資權要完全屬於他們自己。這些日人和那些主張『亞洲人的亞洲』（唯心的說法是『日本人的中國』）一　要日本獨佔戰勝的利益。他們的藉口是如果有利益的話，那也是內軍事行動而耗費巨額的日人的生命和日人的金錢而獲得的。日本民眾正因戰事而犧牲生命和負担額外賦稅，向他們宣傳這個福音的代價是顯然，的國家主義並非日本的專用品，但國家主義在日本對外國在華的投資，無論是直接的或間接的都會有强烈的影響的。</p>
<p>日本人還有一個久經養成的信仰，那就是中國人沒有能力自治。因而推廣中國政府會招致外國的壓迫，而影響中國的勢力應該而且必然是日本的。甚至那日本工業的權威刊物『東方經濟者』也這樣　過：『如要中國的經濟順利的發展，則日本是需要在中國佔優勢的』。日本的比較沒有國家思想的刊物，也採這樣的態度，這自然不是非日籍的投資的好預兆。尤其是當觀察在直接或間接受日政府治理的區域內的外國投資者的地位，更不容人樂觀。</p>
<p>當中國繼續的失去較大城市尤其是在失去廣州和漢口以後，日本要獨吞中國的態度比以前更為强硬。日本已將中國認作日本的附庸，如滿洲國一樣。近衛去年十一月的聲明宣佈日本的目的她「建立保證東亞永久安定的新秩序」，『建立日「滿」支　國的政治經濟文化及其他的互助平等。』主要目的之一是要實現全東亞的『經濟密切聯系。』姑勿論這目的的對與不對，如果不破壞現存的外國企業或破壞他們將來可能的遠東市場。是不會有如他們所想的結果的。華中開發公司的新主席在公司正式成立的時候，曾宣佈日本沒有獨佔中國的意向，亦不致干預現有的外國企業，同時他否認對外資的急需。他雖有不會排除外國的利益的聲明，然實際計劃的施行，不啻關閉了現存的或在計劃中的外國企業的市場。</p>
<p>總而言之，包括一切的獨佔企業的合併，嚴格的通貨　理和不可避免的商業限制，只許外人參加間接投資的限制和要在新佔領地帶樹立優　的威脅，這種種使人感覺得在日本統治下的中國，外國企業是不安全的。</p>
<p>在上面，作者曾表示個人意見，以為目前戰爭的給果日本是不會勝利的。這有什麽理由呢？最明顯的理由是日本軍隊的　緩的進展，和疏忽了對佔領區域的整理。由此可知日軍能不能獲得完全的勝利是很有問題的。雲貴川三省地理上的困難，即可以斷定日本將不得到完全的勝利。還有，蘇日邊境的衝突隨時有發生　可能，這在滿洲與西伯利亞交界的星星之火，很可以成為燎原的大火的。這如成為事實，那麽日軍的主力大抵要用來對付更强大的北方敵人吧。</p>
<p>如果日本得不到勝利，那麽情形將會怎樣呢？有一分可能，那就是情形暫時的不變，日本佔領若干區域。同時中國保留內地各省，這無縫是武裝的休戰。</p>
<p>在這些條件之下，外國投資者在日本佔領區域內的展望如何呢？這大抵不會比日本勝利所生的結果好，或只有更不如。在日人後方的廣大的游擊隊絕不會因日本的停止進攻而停止活動的。即在現在日本只能佔領中國重要的城中和鐵路，在城市和鐵路之外完全是受中國游擊隊支配的。他們常常的對日本軍事和給養施以破壞，當日軍大隊進犯的時候游擊隊便比　的沉默起來，當日軍主力過去了或駐軍力量減少的時候，游擊隊的攻擊又復開始，他們不會停止進攻，讓日人從容的將淪陷區內的經濟鞏固和建設起來的。</p>
<p>中國游擊隊自身不　非常的活動，而且受政府的帮助　激勵，籍以收囘被日軍奪去的失地，日本是沒有能力征服中國，但中國不會沒有能力繼續的困擾日軍，使日人的侵略無利可圖，事實上，中國將從她不可征服的根據地　時的破壞一切的日本的經濟計劃，一如游擊隊所做的一樣。這樣的展望，當然不會利于外國投資者，即使投資者只想通過日人管理的組織而投資的話，這種投資也是無利可圖的。</p>
<p>中國將因此次戰爭而致元氣大傷，戰後又須以獲　的經濟力　來担負起復興的責任，這種廉潔是有相當理由的。日人的侵略做成中國廣大的破壞，中國自身又因軍事上的需要而破壞，各　轟炸，數　萬的難民又因戰爭而遷徙流離，這些原因合起來必然做成中國極嚴重的問題。中國很大部份的生產力破壞了，同時消費力增加了，而這消費的需求是要從那削弱了的生產力中求滿足的。這種情形似乎足以証明一位不列顛中國通的見解是對的，他說：『中國的農村再次的陷入××××，我們習見的混亂又在眼前了，』沒錯，去春因日軍向南急速的進展而　黃河以北的地帶陷於混亂狀態中，有過一個時期是沒有政府統治的，然而，在現在的北方一帶我們發見些什麽？根據可靠方面的調查，那裏混亂的情形不但到了極小的限度，而且在游擊隊管理之下的一切都比戰前進步，假如這樣一個運動能在日軍後方成長起來的話，那麽在中國人統治下的地帶，不是更可以建立同樣的組織來代替土匪和軍閥的統治麽？</p>
<p>漢口英國商會主席馬可在去年的一次演說中這樣說過：『一個政府在這樣的艱苦困難中，這樣的急需　款來支持他自己，最後會場向極　　度的。』作者對這個見解是不贊同的。任何　變鸛獨霸制的趨向是敵不過中國民眾趨向民主主義的心理的。在這需要全民一心一意來支持的抗戰中，中國的農民已經享有若干權利。他們一旦對這些權利覺得滿意時，他們自然會奮鬥堅持這些權利而不放的。所以，作者以為政治獨裁制是不會發生的。</p>
<p>如馬可的意思是說流行於極　國家的經濟政策的話，站在外國企業的觀點來說，那是　得顧慮的，中國管理通貨的困難必使中國政府對外匯作進一步的限制；而這種限制　來還是有增無減的。最後將　迫實行對外貿易的物物交換　。而　政府的商業組織必同時的繼續增加，貿易將轉變為政府或半官式的獨佔。亦中國抗戰開始以前，外國商人巳關心到中國政府對貿易的態度。茶商和桐油的貿易現在已經由政府機關來管　，關於前項貿易，中國政府的本意是改自茶的出口貿易的，並且一個英國茶　專家被騁來做工作。但這中國茶葉公司現在已經變為商人的競爭者了。中國菜油公司同樣已發展為商人的競爭者，而不是　個純　改進菜油目的的組織了，這些政府的新的組織將會繼續的和商人競爭，馬可已在他的演　中指出來：『因平衡物　交換貿易的困難被政府統制的商品日多起來。同時對私人企業亦將施以高度的干涉。』除了這些組織以外，還有數種完全被政府獨佔的企業，　業和銻業是其中的兩種。</p>
<p>如要斷定外國在華企業的前途，我們一定要知道中國政府　終的目的是要收復失地。所以，唯利是圖的外　企業在分裂了的中國是很少機會的。</p>
<p>第三個可能——中國勝　——才是中日戰　最後的結局，因第二個可能，那就是一部份中國士　受日本統治，那不過是暫時的武裝休戰而已，中國必然的會繼續抗戰直至完全收復失地為止。但勝利後的完全獨立的中國會使人起疑懼之心，恐怕中國極端的國家主義思想防碍了外國的利益。</p>
<p>中國曾經屢次聲明她將致力於內部建設，而沒有近代國家主義的侵略意向，然而他們對內並非沒有　用國　主義思想的可能，他們可以建設一個完全屬於中國的經濟，極力的避免外國管理，這會和外國投資者的利益發生衝突的。</p>
<p>大　在戰爭中的國家，商業的限制和因軍事的便利而施行的統制是必需的。因求國家的生存而實行種種政策是天公地道的事。中國的破壞如是之大，將來復興時當然需要一切可用的資源。中國之需要既如此之巨大，那麼她當然會盡力設法去建立一新的近代的經濟，去產　及維持一個有利的商業小衡，去增加外匯用以購買中國沒有的材料，這會使官辦的公司多少與外國商業利益發生衝突。</p>
<p>現在且讓我們研究用貸欵的形式來投資一問題。比方，貸欵修理或處長或建築新的鐵　。這些新的計劃當然由政府或半官式的公司施行。然而中國需要外國資金或信用底援助也是很明顯的事。投資者的利潤是不會從獨佔而是從商業和生產的增加得來的，合法的外國投資可得到合度的利潤，而這種利潤差不多是必然獲得的。然而這種投資不能和任何以前的貸欵相比，以前的貸欵一次便可產生額外巨大的利潤。</p>
<p>所以關于外國在華企業的前途一問題。我們以為無論如何將來再不會像以前一樣的當中國有內爭的時候便巧敢豪奪了。投資的機會當然很少，如果投資者要用以前貸欵的形式來投資的話。在上文所討論的中日戰爭的三個可能的結果中，其中兩個如成為事實，則範圍廣大的外國投資很少立足　機會。無論中國將被日本佔領一部份土地而中國先休養　氣繼續抗戰，或者中國完全被日本征服了，任何這兩個可能結果之一都沒有外國投資的機會，抗戰勝利的中國，雖一切將為中國人的利益而着想，但對于外國的投資還算是最有利的一個結果。</p>
<p>簡單點來說，從中日兩國的目的可以知道在某種情形之下外國投資的機會會比較大些：日本是决意要中國處在半殖民地的狀態而永遠依賴日本　她想以中國做她的市場和原料的泉源。反之，中國只想重新獲得獨立　建立自給自足的經濟。如果在華外國企業有發展的機會酌話　那只有在中國抗戰勝利以後，在中國重建她的經濟的時候。</p>
<h3>日本自由主義者的沒落</h3>
<p>— 賀塞爾原著　（一）　原文載「亞細亞雜誌」</p>
<p>日本的自　主義者現在是已經銷聲匿跡了。在一個正　事　侵略戰爭的軍人統治的國家裏面，自由主義者當然沒有存在的餘地，思想本來就是違禁物，而一般自由主義者的腦筋　充滿了危險思想，這在日本當然是　被人疑忘的。一個組織激進農民的共產黨員，或者一個煽動工潮的搗亂份子，固然相當的危險，但一個自由主義者則比他們更危臉多了。因為他的思想根本就是一種舶來的人生觀的一部份。</p>
<p>這一種危險階段究竟以那些人為代表？說起來也沒有一定的界限和標準。我們不能說每一個智識份子都是自由主義者，而且事實上有很多智階級級的人早就巳經轉變過來，已在那裏高唱「衷心合作」。但智識界終還是自由思想的大本營，一般大事教授因為他們本身所受的教育，以及他們和青年界的密切接觸，現在已經成為全國天字第一號的敵人了。</p>
<p>單是東京一個地方，現在就差不多有二十個大學教授押在那裏，其他地方的數目則無法知道，東京警視廳主管思想部門的人曾說，這些罪犯大多數都是頑梗不化，沒有方法改變。他們為了要轉變那些最不希望的青年教授的思想，真是想盡了方法也不得成功，前囘有一個學經濟的青年教授，因為思想問題被捕，每大都有一個高級官吏到牢裏面去有他，後來又告訴他只要在雜誌上發表一篇文章，否認他以前的見解，便可以馬　恢復他的自由，但一直到現在，他却沒有同意這一種辦法，又有一個政治學教授因為思想問題被他們勒令辭職，他後來便只好寫一點電影批評的文字來維持生活，但他仍在字裏行間繼續發表他的意見，所以結果還是被捕了。規在日本有好幾個大學，東京帝國大學也在其內，只要添聘　職員的時候總得先徵求警廳的同意，換言之，就是現在的大學教授都是由警廳委派的。</p>
<p>自然，被警察壓制得最厲害的還是一般學生。德國的希特勒以前還沒有充分造成他的權威的時候，他就已經肥握着了全國的學生界，但日本情形却是相反的，現在日本的青年智識界正由一種驚　的自由精神在那裏推動。他　不相信法西斯主義的好處，同時也一般的不贊成帝國主義，不贊成侵略政策。他們很秘密的藏着馬克斯的書籍，並且喜歡和現在那些統治者開玩笑。你要是和他們作私人談話，那可更不得了。有幾個學生曾對我說，依照他們的　法，日本的君主政治大約在幾十年內便要「掃清」的。一般熟知日本皇室是如何尊嚴的人聽了他們這樣的話，一分會吃驚不小。</p>
<p>東京警視廳當然是知道這些事情的，所以各大學的附近便常常發生捕人的事，有許多學生在咖啡店裏被警察捉了去也說不出甚麽罪名，就只好　他們荒廢學業，東京大學區裏面有幾家打麻雀牌的地方，竟掛出牌　來，「担保以後不再捉人」。</p>
<p>日本的學生都不是在宿舍裏住的，所以上面這些地方就成了他們公共集合和交換思想的場所了。這一般火性的青年雖然有着各樣的思想，但大多數也沒有什麽危險。他們是沒有組織的，幾年之後離開了學校便被各種職業團體吸收了。在信些職業團體中，他們的精神自然又會經過一番陶鑄的。至于那些著名搗亂的領袖則也有巧妙的方法來對付，那便是先由一個警察署把她們關起來，關了相當的時候便放，放了之後又立刻由　二個警察署把他們捉了，這樣是很容易消磨一些歲月，而他們也不必出一個錢。</p>
<p>除各人學以外，商人當中也可以發現自由主義的思想。不久以　曾有兩個商業界的重要人物在日本工商業俱樂部的私室裏會餐，討論到調節全國經濟的最好方法。當中一個人對現政府種種的方法，如　花的　制等事，都不能贊同，結果竟得到了一　　人的結論，認為「陸海軍的預算應該減到合理的程度。」他的同伴聽了之後也大表贊同，從那裏的窗戶上望出去正看見三　洋行的新建築，但因為軍部不能能　　　的原故已經停工了。　（未完）</p>

<h3>德安附近獲得　×施用毒瓦斯文件　劣踪暴露心勞日拙</h3>
<p>【中央社重慶十六日電】我軍於去年十月在德安附近、鹵獲×施用毒瓦斯文件兩種、均係×「中支那派遣軍司令部」之文件、其一為「徐州會戰及安慶作戰特種　使用戰例及成果」、為昭和十三年七月印發、其二為「特種發煙筒及特種發煙彈用法幷成果利用法」、為昭和十三年八月印發、此兩種文件、前者說明其施用毒瓦斯馳例及成果、後者係說明其施用之方法、茲記其大要如次、</p>
<p>據上文件、×人所施用之毒瓦斯、計有如下三種、一為白色簡裝瓦斯、其作用為發煙、藉以測定風之方向、二為綠色簡裝瓦斯、作中為措淚性特種毒瓦斯、三為紅色簡較竄息性特種毒瓦斯、前一種無毒、後兩種均含有屬性毒素、</p>
<p>關於×人施用毒瓦斯時之勤務、一、偵察發烟計劃方案、二、第一綫指揮官之協定、三、命令下速、四、氣象觀察、五、通訊連絡、六、警戒及掩　、七、資財輸送、八、資材排列、九、點火、十、林技利用、十一、點火後處置、（卽輸送瓦斯簡）又×施放瓦斯後立刻戴上防毒面具、開始總攻、瓦斯在空間僅有卅分鐘之効力、是以當烟簡施放後卽須續放瓦斯、凡毒瓦斯散播後、立刻開始衝鋒、方能取得瓦斯之有効、</p>
<p>以上各種文件內並列舉其施用瓦斯獲得之戰果、其文件內云、六月二日攻　縣、當進抵南門、以我軍固守不能攻陷、乃施用毒瓦斯、惟無結果、於六月四日再度進攻、復大部施用、五月十八十九兩日圍攻固鎮不下、嗣遭我軍猛烈反攻、×見勢危殆、復大放毒氣、六月二日香口之役、所曾施用瓦斯、以後　當　斯橋之役、我軍開始反攻、×無力抵抗、乃復大　施用瓦斯、此外在山西戰場上、如濟源、絳縣、聞喜諸役、亦莫不儘量施用、每次我軍因×之　用瓦斯、致失去細鬥力、而遭受失敗、因此×每遇攻擊、不能取勝、或遭受我反攻無力抵象、乃大量施用瓦斯、結果亦不收得效果、因此×乃積極獎　、並敎導其部隊如何施用、</p>

<p>×為施放毒氣計、其部隊多携有防素面具、惟為掩護起見、反謂為防找軍施用毒氣、此種欲蓋彌彰之事、實祇見其可鄰而已、總之、×方用素瓦斯慘殺我官兵、一方復恐暴露其劣跡、而避免世界之攻擊、乃多方設法掩護、足見其心勞日拙也、</p>
<h3>蔣委員長　宴法大使</h3>

<h3>日圖獨佔在華航業　各國深受影響　華北海運已遭壟斷　內河航線俱被封鎖</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】自×繼封鎖我國沿海各口後、國營民營船隻、被迫停航、日本欲獨覇在華航業、如統制華中內河小輪、礱斷華北海運、計劃開航南洋線、拒絕開放長江　江、英熒各國在華航業、均受影響</p>
<p>在華航運　英佔第一</p>
<p>在中國沿海及內河航業、以　國航運勢力佔第一位、如一九三六年英日美三國在中國各港入口之船　及噸數、英國四八·一五四隻、五七·三四五·五一五噸、日本一七·九一一　、二四·九一三·五七六噸、美國三·九七三隻、三·七七一·四七九噸、則證明英國在華航運力量、較日本多上二倍、但白戰事發生後、情形大變、一九三七年英國船舶在中國出入、減少一二·八三一隻、二一·二三九·七二〇噸、</p>
<p>開戰以後　日圖獨霸</p>
<p>戰後英、美、德、意、葡、希、巴、各國航商、收買華輪、竭力擴充在華航業、但日本企圖獨霸在華航運、如拒絕開放長江及珠江、阻撓外輪行駛蘇北阜寗浙東海門、無理扣留及檢查　輪、同時在華北利用軍事勢力、壟斷海運、華中方面、日已將英國地位、取而代之、華中內大河小輪、由日統制、獨家經營、此外除開航上海　門航綫外、並計劃開闢上海杳港間之甫洋航班</p>
<p>英國航業　一蹶不振</p>

<h3>荊沙青年戰地服務團（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　賡雅</p>
<p>沙巿能于患難中健壯起來，雖然具有客觀條　——人無力進犯，但主觀上軍政措施之得當，尤其新組成　個極得力的民衆服務　體，卽荊沙　界抗×後援會靑年戰　服務團，能以極純潔的愛國熱忱，在內部兢兢業業地做出許多滿　的成績，差不多要佔一個主要决定因素的地位。</p>
<p>現値各　民運工作正在開展之際，對於該團組織經過，生活內容，工作成績各部門，似有加以　明叙述，以作各　借　之必要。</p>
<p>該團之成立，恰當武漢撤退後數日，沙巿人心惶惶，空氣緊張，專　軍警力量來維持，情勢已然　乎不許可。抗援　乃　計組織靑年戰地服務團（沙市已劃成戰區），開始招生，當有流亡靑年踴躍報名，計考取高中以上男女學生××名（女性約佔三分之一强）。為要週　環境需要，拌擬在工作中去求訓練，一經改編成隊，即開始實際上的服務工作。</p>
<p>團員待遇：每月津貼國幣十元，一切在內。餘如團長，團副，指導，秘書，總務，傳令各一人，隊長三人，共計九人，均與團員同等待遇，完全義務職。惟此九人官兵伙食，由團長私人解囊津貼。此外尙有幹事十七人，待遇亦與團員同。以上各員兵，均須在營內經常辦事。一律同食，同衣，同宿，同生活，以充分　現半等精神。</p>
<p>該團之成立，與一般民衆團體不同。普　民衆團體成立，須先有什麼法規做組織工作的　準。該團因時間限制，眞是隨時招生，就隨時開始工作，在工作中自求訓練，在實踐中糾正錯誤。工作方法亦隨時隨地而異，初成立時，以安定人心為中心工作。但遇空襲時，於警報解除後，卽對民衆宣傳防空常識，誅除漢奸方法。總之，每對一新問題發生，對民衆宣傳，僅講應付方法，而不講空洞原理。</p>
<p>團長對團員平時訓話要點：第一，對於精神方面，以國家至上，民挨至上為前提，以軍事第一，勝利第一為目標；在一個政府一個領袖下精誠團結，驅逐倭×，復興中華民族。第二，生活方面，思思想政治化；行動軍事化；工作科學化；成績藝術化。推動由下而上，養成自决，自動，各自為戰的精神；領導由上而下，以防思想行動興政府法令違悖。總之，生活革命化。</p>
<p>組織：全幽設團本部。團員以生活管理方法分成三隊，第一隊，係年齡較長的男性；第二隊，年齡較小的男性；第三隊，是不分年齡的女性。各隊隊長、聘由軍事敎官當任；另有隊附，則由團員中自行選出。</p>
<p>全團工作方法，計分九組：一，話劇，二，　報，三，漫畫，四，講演，五，歌詠，六，慰勞，七，救護，八，除奸，九，民連。每組設組長一人，由團員選任；幷有名譽指導一人，指導各粗有專門性的工作。每團員可以兼做數組工作，但必須選定一組為主要工作。</p>
<p>該團工作表現，例如壁報組織點：一、自備收音機；二、由警備司令部供給特殊電報及電話——故消息靈通，博得社會好評。</p>
<p>演講組，曾動員全市民衆，做肅奸工作，破獲漢奸案數起。實行新生活，推進淸潔運動，掃除全市　埃糞草，幷肅淸各街　所貼廣吿，使市容煥然一新。使用標語幷不多，每次僅用三種，或一二種。意義力求單純，明白，幷有時代性，刺戟性。標語如此。　書亦如此。風聲鶴唳時，有兩家銀行預　喬遷他處，經該團派人動阻，卽巳打銷遲感。</p>
<p>慰勞組，除募集滋養食品，慰勞傷兵而外，幷用背心，布鞋，手巾等去慰　做國防工事的士兵。</p>
<p>救護組對象。除搶救傷兵及難童而外，幷救濟難民。難民　登記疏散者，共二千三百餘人。　身壯丁，送江陵（荊州）縣府編組輸送隊，幼　送保育院，老年送養老院，有特殊技能者，則送湖北旅渝問鄕會介紹工作、以增加後方生　。　（未完）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>痛心之一幕　——記捷克的淪亡</h3>
<p>一九三九年三月十五日，捷克共和國權奧地利之後，在妥協　服政策下宣佈自己的死刑，正式淪亡了！捷克怎樣淪亡！捷克淪亡以後的歐局如何？這是每一個為民族求解放為自己求幸福的中國同胞們所不能忽視的。我們就在這里作「個簡明的評述吧！</p>
<p>希特勒煊赫入捷京</p>
<p>據十六日美聯社捷京電，德國侵略者的魔王希特勒，已於十五日在風雪中煊稱蒞臨捷京。十六日領導「祝捷巡行」。捷克共和國的現狀是：</p>
<p>（一）斯洛伐克區宣佈「獨立」，實際上是成為德國的附庸，一切均受德國侵略者的支配。</p>
<p>（二）羅遜尼亞區為匈牙利所併吞。但匈勒兩軍已在對峙中。因為匈併稱逐尼亞後，卽與波蘭接境，可能形成阻止德　直接衝突。這裏當然顯露了意德間的矛盾，糾紛尙在演進。</p>
<p>（三）捷克所剩兩富裕省份，波希米達及摩拉維亞，實際上成為德國屬省，七百萬人同淪為亡國奴隸，希特勒處置辦法是一，波　兩省財政及關稅制度與德國結合；二，德國接收捷克國家銀行全部準備金；三，解散捷軍，由德經營全部國防事宜：四，在兩者施行紐倫堡猶太法。</p>
<p>我們在這裏希望一般誤聽「反共」，「主和」，「妥協」，「國際調解」之論的同胞，拭員來看捷克共和國在「反共」「主和」「中途妥協」「國際調解」等政策下亡國的悲劇！</p>
<p>英國的鼓噪與歡呼</p>
<p>捷克的淪亡，顯為德國侵略者粉碎慕尼黑協定和英法妥協政策失敗的明證。十五日晚英首相張柏倫在下院報告，亦不得不承認此點，而謂：「德國今日所為，余決不信慕尼黑各簽字國所能預料。」其實英法兩國人民最近劇烈推進的反××運動正是『預料』的證據，可惜張氏不願看到和說到而已！張氏報吿於「極表遺憾」以外，仍以『不宜妄動』勉其國人，吾人當知其用心與處境之苦矣—反對黨員之鼓噪護　，可以說是人民公意的反映，工黨議員椊蘭費爾所謂「吾人今日實　走向和平與安定之時代，危機巳迫眉睫，今日捷克可滅，明日波蘭繼將淪亡，寖而匈牙利羅馬尼亞，結果豈堪設想」？張伯倫對此豈有不知之理？張氏最後宣稱已委派海外貿易大臣赫森報聘華沙，莫斯科，芬蘭赫爾斯基等地，會衆聞而歡呼。我們可以斷言，英國此種怒罵與歡呼之聲，正是全英以至全世界正義和平人類之聲，張伯倫政府如不願領覆，則首當在此怒罵與歡呼聲中知所取捨了。</p>
<p>蘇聯紅軍首長的警告</p>
<p>十五日莫斯科電稱，蘇聯國防人民委員長伏羅希洛夫為紅軍備軍　，對外國記者，痛斥關於紅軍削弱士氣瓦解的謠言。伏氏大聲宣言：「最近進犯哈桑湖之法西斯軍（指日軍犯張鼓峯事），亦正為此種謠言所誤，當時以為時機不可失，急不及待，乃致自招挫辱。哈桑湖之結果，已成普通常識。如法西斯主義者仍認為不足，必欲受更大之敎訓，則蘇聯之軍靜待久矣，盍來一試！』又美聯社十六日電稱伏氏又於十五日聯共大會上報告　自一九三四年以來，蘇聯兵力已增兩倍，各將士均受嚴格訓練，養成國際主義精神，並已準備完成，隨時可予侵略者以痛擊，這是祇是對於東進中之希特勒，同時亦對正在叫囂挑　中的日本以一大警告，我們也要警告那些固執成見和甘為×奸張目的少數言論，在蘇聯實力發展和反侵略的宣示行動表現之下，你們快些收拾一切惡意議罵，快不要在廣大民衆面前献醜吧！</p>

<h3>竊匪的故事</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>一個嚴重的社會問題</p>
<p>在黑沉沉的氛圍裏，傳來一片號呌的聲音，把週遭沉睡的人，都從好夢中驚醒了，大家都奪門而出，爭看何事。原來却是一個小偷爬進二樓的工人房，盜竊東西，給人抓往了。於是，七八條大漢，把這麼一纔十幾歲身材矮小的小偷，圍着　毆，拳頭　雨點般向　的胸口肋骨　撞。小偷像宰豬般的亂滾亂叫，那種　厲的呼號。刺激每個人的神經。不久，圍觀的人是不忍聽，也不忍看這種慘事而漸漸散去了。記者歸到寢室，蒙被重睡，迄難把這幕慘劇忘掉。　這個小偷給人毆擊完了，還給綑着，在睡眼朦朧中，聽到了好幾個人替這個小偷說情：『把他放了吧！』跟着小偷也凄凄凉凉的啼號起來，說他「因為家貧，沒飯吃，　出來幹這種勾當，請來各位可憐可憐放了我吧！」然而結果，天明時這個小偷便給送到警署去了。</p>
<p>我們應該注意之點，不是這個小偷的偷東西，而是他為甚麼要偷東曲，自然，他幷不是一出娘胎使是賊子的，在他當小偷以前，是曾經歷過很多人主的歷的了：——我們看看，在路上東奔西跑，掙扎在飢寒線上的報童和擦鞋的小童好了，他們一樣也有和暖的家庭，慈藹的父母，不過內家境的貧寒，這些年紀還水成熟的小童就開始在生活線上掙扎；因為同一命運的兒童太多了，競爭轉趨劇烈，事實上有很多擦鞋童和報童，連他們自己的生活也沒法維持的。他們是處在一個怎樣悽涼的境地啊！</p>
<p>為了整飭巿容，警察當局曾嚴厲的拘拿他們，希望把這些小童廊，然而把他們抓到了，送到兒童法庭裏審訊，罰欵坐牢子，鞭笞，用盤種種刑拘，始終不易杜絕他們；相反地，因為牢獄裏有好的衣，有美的食，有踢球，有　戲，有玩，有樂，一切的一切，對於他們太美好了，他們夢想也不會想出這麼優美的環境，他們有點不願意離併那個牢獄的了！一個擦鞋童子悄悄的吿訴記者，他這樣設法故意給警差抓去，送到牢子裏的故事，因為他家裏實　窮到連飯也沒得吃啊！這是一個如何悲痛的故事</p>
<p>顯然地，這些小童，實在沒法　拿的啊！於是，拘拿小竄的事件，漸漸少了，換過來，祇把他們的擦鞋具搗毀，這祗增加了他們心頭上的憎恨更因為拘捕太多了，他們已經不認為拘拿是一件奇　的事啊，我們很容易看得到的，在路上一羣擦鞋童子，時常像舞龍一般的給警差追拿着，這是一個一樣詼諧的場面！</p>
<p>敎育已經和這眾流浪的孩子絕緣了，他們日夕所學的祗是賭博，日夕所玩的祗楚紙牌，窮賭濫吃，就是他們的日常課程，他們在這種環境裏，長人起來。不是社會之福，而是社會的蟊賊；歹徒與地痞，小偷與盜賊，就是這些流浪的而又無敎育的兒童孵化出來的了，這是一個多麼嚴電的社會問題。</p>
<p>歸結起來說，像上面那樣的毆　小偷，濫用私刑，用恐怖的手段，就可以廊淸這些小偷的麼　决不，除非把那些還未生殖起來的壞根苗除了，就是使這些流浪的兒童都有飯喫，都有受敎育的機　啊！</p>

<h3>閩東第二綫的古田</h3>
<p>【福州華南社通訊】福州經占田　閩北建　的公路、新近　築完　、實行通車、這是閩省運輸建設上的一件「　献」、往昔從福州到本省內　、祗有　閩江上　的一綫、　占甌路一　、便增添了一條　陸大道了、</p>
<p>記者第一次打這條陸路從福州去　北、那日清晨六時、天空滿佈　　　　、凍　　　地下　、福州站上、還是冷清得很、等了一個半鐘頭、旅客把車廂擠滿了、才衝過雨濕的福州市街、出城向西開駛、</p>
<p>雨下得大、為防雨點向軍內襲擊、車窓至給拉上了。玻璃凝結起一層水蒸氣、窓外的田野景色、便漸漸迷糊、而至完全看不見了、等到開入閩清縣界、大雨漸收、下窓外矚、眼前即展開一片青翠的田野山林、汽車駛過、青翠中還現出一片片白花繁開的桃林、好似堆雪一般、—分冷艷動人、這一帶地方、四野麥苗油綠、果樹成蔭、山上林木茂密、多係松杉、比起閩西北各縣、出產豐富多了、一路所見村舍、又要比閩西北來得整潔、可見這一帶地方的居民生　、一定比較富裕了、</p>
<p>車經白沙鎮，係屬閩清縣轄、市鎮雖小、景象頗不冷落、乘客下車就鎮上攤販買了一點小菓糕餅充饑、我從居民的安閒神色、測出他們的生活情狀、所受戰　時　的間接折磨、一定并不怎樣厲害、中國民族富有彈性、雖然抗戰經歷了二十個月、而廣大的農村中、仍潛藏着有無限的動力、可以用為不　的鬥爭、比起易於崩潰的工業國家的日本來、持久戰鬥的先天條件、顯然要强得多了、不過、一半自然也由於政府的處之若定、從實際充實着民族內在的力量、才有今天這樣可以從容應付的局面、</p>
<p>旅行遇雨、心情鬱悶、在車上不覺打起睡來、不知什麽時光、車已到達古田站、雨下得很大、城中又無熟人、此時投往何處、一時　芒然不知所措、後來承一位站工的照顧、才替　設法到一家設備簡陋的客棧中、安頓下來、</p>
<p>此時正是廢歷正月初旬、古田城中家家戶戶、張貼着鮮紅的春聯、但先前舊俗的祝語、即已換上「抗戰到底」「最後勝利」等民族革命鬥爭的口號、這現象、証明民間對抗戰的認識、已經漸漸普遍了、記得去年春間、閩省集合全省高中學生分發各縣從事民訓工作時、分在古田縣工作的英華中學學生、特別賣力、當時成績、為全省之冠、現在古田民間抗戰意職的發揚滋長、當時那一批縣誠年輕的伙伴、要據大部分的功　、</p>
<p>古田在福建抗戰中、佔　　　　　的地位、從　　南進入閩中、　　　必經之路、假設×人從福州登　、攻　內線、則沿公路北　、必經古田、又如　人從三都澳登陸、則經福　或　　、　擊　中、古田自又首當其　、將來福　的戰事如果發生在閩南、古田可以　　、如果發生在閩東、古田就無　的是保衛內陸的第二線了、目前閩省對沿海防務、業已佈置就緒、而第二線力量的配備、亦已臻相當充實、不管這配備的力量今後有無應用之日，而軍事當局的預為策劃用心實至可欽佩、</p>
<p>記者冒雨訪問古田縣長、在黯淡的電燈光下、談了一個小時、縣長黃澄淵先生、是本省龍溪縣人、到任八個多月了、與訊者談施政經過及未來計劃、頭頭是道、可見他對於自己的事業、具有相當的把握、福建的　長、就記者數月來旅行遇見的十幾位來說、全是青壯的年紀、沒一個老朽頑固的　官僚、這可見出閩省當局任用官吏的新精神、</p>
<p>古田治安相當平定、偶有散匪出沒、也多是截途攔劫之輩、只要保甲組織臻於嚴密、自可不成　題、鄉閒　匪、大抵是貧困的副產物、而古田的民間經濟、比較上還能自給、算不得貧窮、據查古田每年出不米穀、在七十萬担以上、人口十八萬、以每人年耗三担計、全縣還有十六萬担的賸餘、可以運銷福州及閩東羅源寧德各縣、此外還有　木的出產、假閩江運福州出口、收入也不在少數、雖然古田是一個入超縣份、每年入超數在四十萬元左右、但當地旅居南洋經商的華僑有六千人、每年匯　的款項、可以抵前項入超數而有餘、所以就大體說來、古田的民間經濟、足以自給、民間生活既易解决、治安當然可以無處、不但治安可以無虞、就是其他的設施、也容易　進了、</p>
<p>不過、古田雖近福州、而過去公路未通、交進阻梗、社會風氣仍極閉塞、這祇要看到　在—六七歲以上的女子緾足還很普遍、便可以知道、現在交通一便利、非常時期强烈灌輸方式的教育一實行、這一堵舊社會的　壁、自非很快地推翻不可了、</p>
<p>「繁榮內地　建設後方！」、這是最高國策、也是福建省目前唯一重要的施政方針、古田縣在這一决策之下　無疑的能在最短期間、充實其內容、發　出第二線的力　來、　鄭蔚又</p>
<h3>新淡水巡禮（續）</h3>
<p>— 復然</p>
<p>（二）封建勢力和頑固的成見</p>
<p>淡水一向是個多頭主義的社會、這社會的領袖、中有落伍的軍人、失意的政客由地主搖身　來的新興民族資本家、有那個大鄉屯的紳十、有這個姓族的人望……但是最重要的便是所謂青年與老年一派的對立、其實是青年和封建資產級的對立吧了、在大革命時代的鬥爭是劇烈的、</p>
<p>這次新人物的登台、他們雖然那是統一陣綫的忠實執行者、他們心目中只有民族利益、只有一個企圖：把全淡水的男女老少不分階級黨派都總動員起來而已、但是因為他們都是肯年、他們的登台、一些人便這樣看、「是反對老年派的青年派的青年派登台了、他們是永遠和老年人不妥協的、永遠要和老年人對立的、」而在實際上、這一個成見却真也十分厲害、這是痛心的事、這種成見使到這些新人　但難得到他們的積極帮助、并且要得到他們　不合作、甚至阻碍、打擊、</p>
<p>（三）救亡工作者本身的缺點</p>
<p>的確、淡水的救亡工作者羣、雖然都曾從不斷的工作中鍛鍊過來、但是其中的缺點還不可避免、</p>
<p>（甲）自由主義的作風——這不只表現在私人生活上的散漫、主要的在學習與工作中顯示出不積極、懶漫地、客觀上是怠工的自由主義、</p>
<p>（乙）不能儘量運用統一戰綫——　們相信淡水救亡工作者每個都了解什末叫做統一戰綫、并且願　　　一戰綫而　力到底、但是他們只會消極地不和各方面取對立或歧視、避免惡　，但是沒有積極地去爭取他們的同情和協肋、</p>

<h3>賈克奈的談話　創造固有銀幕性格</h3>
<p>四年前、占　　　　　正在攝影場上工作、有一个看門人走過來、低聲對他　、「那邊有一个名叫佛　　勃克的小孩要見你、他說他寫過許多信給你呢、」</p>
<p>一刻工夫之後、占　斯賈克奈彷彿在照鏡子似的、看到立在他面前的佛蘭基勃克、大約比他小十歲光景、矮上四五英寸左右、除此以外、不論是面貌、體態、神情都和他一模一樣、甚至說話的聲音語句、也不差分亳、全部是他一個極端相似的複　、「對不起、請問」、他忍不住笑了、「我們以前好像在什麽地方遇見過的是嗎、」</p>
<p>在這個四年前的會見中、佛蘭基告訴占姆他的希望、要想做一個職業上的占姆賈克奈第一、他已有過不少次演劇經騐、專一摹倣占姆斯就是他的主要工作、在那時候、占姆斯對於這個小孩能摹倣自己到維妙維肖這一層、　很覺得驚異有趣、可是對終他將來的希望未加一句贊辭、</p>
<p>於是四年過去了、占姆斯賈克奈主演的華納新片Angels　With　Dirty　Faces裏需要一個扮幼年時期占姆斯的小孩、佛蘭基又被找出來了、他演得和占姆斯如此相像、幾可亂真、以致試演時有許多看客相信那是經過化裝後的占姆斯本人、其後一張The　O　Ianoma　Kid裏、他更進一步的摹倣着占姆斯最近的幾種動作、急扭着肩膀、與　的揮着手、然而這種摹倣他感得到痛苦了、他對占姆斯說、</p>
<p>『討厭極了、我找不着一點別的事做、人人都說我太像你了』、扭動着肩膀、</p>
<p>『只有一個辦法可想、占姆斯泰然自若的說、極力遏制着不叫自己的肩膀也動起來、</p>
<p>『什麽法子』</p>
<p>『不要再摹倣我、』</p>
<p>『不再學你、但是、這個不行』又動動肩膀、『或者我應該如此、可是、……我像你像了好多年了、我不能再做別的事、』</p>
<p>『看着』占姆斯說、恬靜的微笑着、『我做我的　期、總比你做我的時期長罷、我還能够時常改變我自已、我想你也一定能變過來的、我學到一條很重要的法則、絕對不要讓觀　看到你重複演差不多的角色、而一個相似的演員、正如一個相似的角色一樣、永遠不能有好叫座力量、偶一為之還可以、可是成了習慣……』他若有深意的聳肩、</p>
<p>『我想我們明白　的意思了、讓我再想想』於是導演來叫拍戲、談　告了結束</p>
<p>佛蘭基只注意到占姆斯的外表、而忽略了他的性格、我們曉得、占姆斯是富於理想、敢於嘗試的、能自己創造出一種新角色來、這就是他所以有今日之成功的緣故、他所演過成功的角色、無一不是如此造成、佛蘭基可以學賈克奈、然而他决不　成為第二個賈克奈、賈克奈之今日由他的過去所造成、學不到他的過去、也就不能有和他一樣的現在和將來、當然、賈克奈的演技也有摹倣之處、可是、他的摹倣、却是由自己日常生活中採取出來、這兒一點那兒一點的、在一起、經過許多洗鍊的手術後才採用、</p>
<p>有一段例子、沒有多少人知道的、那是在占姆斯還是一個小孩和　的父親和哥哥比爾住在一起的時候、兄弟倆有一個常玩的把戲、比爾一把抓住占姆斯的項頸握緊華頭在臉上　着、用着粗暴的語氣說、『你要是真的話、我打出你的腦漿來』然後、維持着這个樣子一小會、方才那種粗野的空氣忽地化為烏有、兄弟倆又很親熱的抱在一起、</p>
<p>占姆斯從小就很喜歡玩這个把戲、他父親死了之後、也還時時想起來、這一套把戲、正是他日後那種銀幕性格的象徵、就是在他已經成為一个演員後、他還極力的想找一個機會在戲中表演這一套、終於這樣的機會來了、在一張和洛麗泰楊合演叫做Tsxi的片子裏、他倆應該老是吵鬧着、每次吵起來、他就一把握住她頭頸、說着如上述的同樣的話、在他是駕輕就孰、成績富然十分滿意、獲得絕大的贊　、為什麽、為什麽一個小動作　有偌人的成功呢、（這全動作真是十二萬分的成功、看過這片的人走出戲院門、也抓住別人頭頸學他呢）、正因為它是摹倣日常生活中的、並不摹倣別的戲劇上的動作、而是新鮮的、不是陳舊的、占姆斯演過這一次、就不敢在別的戲裏再演了、「不能讓觀眾看到你演重複的好動作、否則它將失去真實性了」、</p>
<p>在Angels　With　DirtyFaces裏、占姆斯老是說一句口頭寒喧語、你聽見點什麽、你　什這句話也曾在占姆斯的意識裏潛　了十五年之久他以　認識一個粗　的東部人，一看見別人、總是說這兩句話以作寒喧、十年一日毫無變化、占姆斯也聽熟了、終於在本片中得到機會施展出來、這就是他能對每一角色下過工夫研究的　證同樣一句　、只有在　種角色口中　出才對、某種神情也只有用於某種角色身上才配、就如上文所說的那個扭動肩勝的動作、原來也有所本、幾年前、遇見了一位曾有一面之交的朋友、就是這樣時時扭動着肩膀、占姆斯問他、</p>
<p>「有什麽東西叮你麽？」</p>
<p>「衣裳」、他說「我穿不　它、比我以前穿的時候好像小了不少、你恐怕不知道……我被關了不少時　」、</p>
<p>他是　　由監獄裏放出來的、占姆斯牢記了這一點、直到如今才　出來應用、還有一點是佛蘭基應該知道的、上面說過、占姆斯能有今日、是他過去努力的結果、然而這不過是部份的趣由、最重要的、他　像個人的性格、舉個例　、他在銀　上常是個蠻漢、可是平　的賈克奈却完全相反、所以軍事　他那點蠻不講理的勁兒終歸會招致批評而很快的失敗、</p>
<p>這兒又有一件事足以証明他平素並不如在銀幕上那樣一個　理的　　、雖則他生就了那樣一張臉子、</p>
<p>占姆斯剛剛進華納工作的一位技師華萊惠司摩、最先看到時、不過互相很　單的打個招呼而已、後釆慢慢的兩人的友誼漸深了、某次談話之間、惠司摩對他說、『我想我現在可以說出來了』、『什麽』、『記得我們第一次遇見的情形麽、你知道我那時候真想賞你一拳麽』、『為什麽呢』、『為了你那張臉、我總當你是無理的傢伙、自　、我現在知道你不是　樣的人、杏則我也不會告訴你了』、</p>
<p>更足以証明他是個謙謙君子的、是他那低軟的喉音、無論在銀幕上或日常生活中、他永遠是低聲下氣的說話、以致有時候、令人非傾耳靜聽不可、他自己不愛　聲大嚷、同時也不願人家這樣、</p>
<p>這裏可以看出、像佛蘭基勃克那樣的長期摹倣他到維妙維肖、固然是很難得的了、可是他永遠不　幹到賈克奈一樣的聲音和地位、賈克奈對他說的話、同時也告訴了許多專事摹倣、以冀成名的人們、「發展你們自己的性恪、建立起你們的聲譽來、』同時地　、『我想佛蘭基將來很有希望、他有飽滿的精力、精力飽滿和工作努力是最重要的原素、而他都具　』、自然、附加的條件是不要弄錯了方向、　些一個真正的『自己』、</p>

<p>昨天下午五時、該隊與南華華對壘於加山、此乃一幕循例而舉行的戰事、等於練習、弟弟亦無爭勝的必要、而哥哥之勝、當然不是掩耳盜鈴、一般看客、心中有數、曉得此次會戰、定少精彩、所以多數裹足不前、車馬稀疏、甚為冷落、</p>
<p>南南陣裏、亂點鴛鴦譜、此舉並非小覷弟弟、其實明白弟弟必讓兩分、故乃隨便排陣而已、</p>
<p>半月來不見踪跡的楊水益、昨天復出、神態安然</p>
<p>角逐起來、隨隨便便、雖無緊張可言、尙有一二可觀、結果、哥哥以四比一得勝、這是一件意中事、</p>
<p>上半時二比零、當然哥哥佔先、建功的景祥與滿榮、下半時二比二、哥哥方面射入的景祥與斗文、弟弟方面扣中的水益與錦洪、（太歲）</p>

<h3>公開網球賽　陳志強不敵大徐　今天雙單打各一場舉行</h3>
<p>香港木球會主辦之全港公開單雙打草地網球賽、開始多天、留强汰　、漸入緊張階段、該會辦事人、且僱工建棚趕築棚座、大約于第四週比賽時、卽可轉移新陣地、看客視　、從此可以集中、以免東奔西　、依照往年情形、棚座者雖納座價、但非到準决賽與决賽、一般普羅球迷仍有參觀機會、想今年事例威與往年相同、容查續報、</p>
<p>昨日節目、　有可觀、全港單打冠軍保持人徐煒培對南華會卒屆單打冠軍陳志强一幕、最感興奮、首盤陳志强用神過步、失去常態、反手擊球、不知所措、徐氏來其弱點、屢次向左路抽殺、遂一氣呵成以六比〇先獲一盤、第二盤陳氏肅靜從事、正手抽送、異常　利、連中兩　、徐氏不敢息慢、上網厮殺、追回和局、此時陳氏抵抗甚劇、反手救球、肅吿總　、大刀闊斧之徐氏、每露制敵不易之態度、旋以五比五戰成平手、賽至第七局、陳氏疲于奔命、反攻乏衛、卒至見貨、</p>
<p>李安納對司徒　一塲、頗有看頭、司徒璧先施下馬威、以六比一勝第一盤、祗惜以後氣力不足、連負兩盤、而被淘汰、統觀兩人技術、不分伯仲、李氏雖個性燥急、但昨戰極為用心、沉着應付、氣力亦足、司徒鑒不擅攔網、反而頻上網邊、遂自招損而敗、</p>
<p>昨日成績</p>
<p>單打</p>
<p>那錫勝奧林珍、六比三、六比三、徐煒培勝陳志强六比〇、七比五、陳錦滿勝蔡炳芬、六比三、六比四、徐潤培勝王澤森、六比一、六比一、李安納勝司徒璧、一比六、六比二、六此二、</p>
<p>今日秩序</p>
<p>今天有雙單打各一場舉行、大林珍是個中名手、功夫老練、應勝衣云士、雙打羅定咸與力奇組、亦應勝對方、此兩揚俱下午四時半舉行、</p>

<h3>小型球賽　傑志勝漢英</h3>
<p>榮業牌小型足球賽、昨日下午五時、傑志戰漢英隊于蕭頓球場、開賽後、爭持頗烈、漢志卒以守慚薄弱、遂為　志先後由黎兆榮、葉國英、朱錦成各勝一球、而漢英　炳土亦射入一球、完塲時、傑志以三比一獲勝、</p>
<h3>今晚乒乓賽</h3>
<p>鑑泉林乒兵賽、今晚共有三塲、在孔聖會舉行、（七時）俠影對　年、（八時）健行對俠影、（九論）華義對協進、俠影陣勢頗　、當有取勝可能、像行對俠影一塲、雙方實力相埒、華義對協進、亦旗餃相當、勝負未可預料、</p>
<h3>南華會開始徵求　十九日行授旗禮</h3>
<p>南華體育會、以本屆徵求會員、即將出發、特定於本月十九日下午七時、假座孔聖堂舉行授旗出發　禮、屆時請王正廷博士蒞臨主持外、幷有各種游藝助慶、</p>
<h3>葉北華返港　說不定復登場献技</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】葉北華這個名字、近年來在報紙上……的體育關內雖巳很少見到、但有許多球迷尙不會忘記其人、</p>
<p>誰也承認的、我國自有足球史以來、葉氏是個頂好的左翼、亦是南華中興的功臣、</p>
<p>他出席世運歸來、在一九三六至三七年度的足球季、仍舊為南華効力、惟因他每次參戰必不欺塲、以英勇見稱於時、而其笑勇所得的結果、足部受傷甚劇、乃迫得從事休養、同時他在粵省府供職、事務甚繫、及至中日戰事爆發後、彼仍公務人員、不能常常請假來港作足球之戲、因是之故、葉氏息影球塲、差不多有三年光景了、</p>
<p>昨天午後、我忽然遇着葉氏於加山　館、相見之下、欣然道故、他說：「今天晨早、剛從汕頭返抵香江」、</p>
<p>他吿訴我、去年（農曆）歲晚、由連縣到汕、得遇昔日球友梁玉堂、李惠官、李省官、李啟明等、有暇的時候、也曾玩玩足球、但因放棄日久、踢起來自覺已不像樣子了、言下有不勝今昔之慨</p>
<p>他此次歸來、或有相當時日的居留、而其一種運動家之英風颯颯、尙現諸顏色、未悉能否假予機會、復登球場、與球迷再相見、我信得過、此乃可能的事、（東郞）</p>
<h3>李安納進行請假　願隨東方足球隊南征</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）東方足球隊、現進行籌備於是屆球事結束後、舉師南征（海防、河內）、並為增厚出征力量、向外招兵買馬、上海球人許文奎與曹秋事、也在被邀之列、聽說許曹二氏、已有覆電、到時甚願從征、又聽說李安納與蘇沙（聖約瑟隊員、）亦曾　到東方某主事人的聘書、徵求他倆的意見、是否願意隨行、昨天記者適在香港木球會場內遇着李安納、乃向他詢問、是否眞有是事、他爽直地承認是眞的、並謂已進行請假、如得允准、樂得出外一遊云、</p>
<h3>也來談談兒童體育（二）</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>我國古時所謂、「物有本末」、「本固枝榮」、欲齊其末、先治其本一等等固本的敎訓、多得歡不勝數、國人知道得滾瓜爛熟的、也不乏其人、照例在這種古訓熏陶之下、對於一切根本事業、應當用全力來注意、使他能發揚光大、達成使命、但是事實的矛盾、層出不窮、眞是使我大惑不解的、</p>
<p>先從母親說起、受着舊禮敎束縛的女子、一心抱着三從四德、從一而終、惟賢妻良母是求的觀念、她們每日除了處理柴米油鹽醬醅茶七事而外、只知道相夫課子、侍奉翁姑、足跡不離深闔一步、倘叫她們來體操打球、那不是說你在興妖作怪、一定說你是大孽不道、</p>
<p>為浪漫習尙所染的女子、就抱着她們所認為的樂天主義、過一日樂一日、成日呼蘆喝雉、俾夜作畫、她們的精力、不是消耗在方城、定是消耗在竹林、甚至於把一榻橫陳、斥雲吐霧、戕身最利害的把戲、也當作求樂的途徑、</p>
<p>為愛美觀念所驅使的女子、腦海中只有、什麼嬌小玲瓏呀、弱不勝衣呀、什麼婀娜多姿呀、婉轉動人呀、什麼芙蓉其面、楊柳其腰呀……等等、一切的一切、認為越是　、和細弱的、越是天仙化人、所以體惟恐其不嬌小、態惟恐具不婀娜、聲惟恐其不婉轉、因此壯健發達就和她們背道而馳、變作了她們的仇敵、不肯一顧、</p>
<p>這禮敎浪漫愛美三者演進的結果、才把我中華民族的女子、未來主人翁——兒童——的母親弄得厭厭一息、了無生氣、要叫遇樣垂死的母親、生出生龍活厭一般的兒童、豈是事實所能、</p>
<p>再說兒童、一個人的成長、是靠着　陳代謝的作用、由呼吸而產生新鮮的血液、由運動而促進血液的循環、然後因而液的循環而營養能輸送到全身、營畏發的工作、廢物能排出體外、體內障碍得驅除凈盡、所以一個要生長的人、呼吸和運動　一刻不能缺少的、</p>
<p>生長是一個人的自然現家、凡關於生長必須的技能、不要學習、自然而然會的、這就叫作天性、兒童自從出娘胎後、他們成日的工作就是：吃飽了動、動倦了睡、睡餓了再吃、他們正天唱着這吃動睡的三部曲、從無厭倦的表示、為的就是要生長、而動的　性、除了與生長有關而外、與個人的前程關係尤大、這種活動、要是不用人力來壓制、而導之入正規、發揮光大、可作一切事業的基本、</p>
<p>兒童的運動、並不要伐什麼材料、定什麼時間、限什麼地區、像成人一樣、他們睡在搖籃裏的哭、就是犬然的深呼吸、因哭而做出的伸拳縮腿的動作、就是天然的運動、他們因為哭著伸着縮着而發出的一身大汗、等於成人在運動塲上　着跳着發出來的一身大汗一樣、他們那種不用人導引的運動、是一種天性的發揮、我們不但不應當加以抑制、並且應當因熱利導、</p>
<p>做父母的往往因為寶貴他們的兒童、誤會了兒童的哭和動的意思、以為兒童的哭和動、一定身心感覺什麼不舒服、多哭多動了、於他們的身體有損無益、甚至於因為他們的哭和動而給一些　他吃、他　此不哭不動、才誤會兒童的哭和動的目的是要吃、因此他一哭、趕快把奶塞　了他的口裏、使他欲哭不得、一動就把他抱着亂抖、使他欲動無法、殊不知他們的哭和動、是適應看生理方面生長的需求、吃也是他們生長需求之一、給他吃而他不冉哭動、一則因為奶在他的興裏、無法再哭、一則因為他得到了代替生長的要求、也不必再動、但是這都不能適應他們天性的要求、長此演進的結果、他們好動的天性、就從此消滅、永無發揮的餘地、那些呆若木雞的　朋友、都是從這裏養成的、</p>
<p>等到兒童會走路、會行動之後、他們的動更是沒有一刻停止、而坐不能適合他們的要　、於是攀　爬凳、走不能適合他們的要求、於是要跑要跳、他們就是從　上凳上跌了下來、或是跑跑跳跳、跌了一個倒載葱、哭了幾聲、又在那攀爬跑跳了、　他們並不是不怕跌、但是因為要發揮他們的天性、覺得不攀爬、不跳　、比較跌還要　得可怕、所以雖跌還是要攀爬跑跳、做父母的往往責備他們坐沒有坐相、走沒有走相、每遇到他們一舉爬一跑跳、就要用怒　來禁止、怒罵禁止不了、就用責打、於是他們活潑的好動天性、就在怒為責打的淫咸下葬送了、</p>
<p>說到實地施行兒童體育訓練的材料問題、在家庭裏面、能夠須着兒童天性、聽其發揮的、已是很少、上面巳經說過、要是應用適宜的體育材料來訓練兒實的、更是鳳毛麟角了、在我國目下家庭敎育未能充分發展以前、不必苛責、不過學校裏面、是有着體育功課、聘着體育敎員的、他們所取的兒童體育訓練村料、又是怎樣？</p>
<p>以我這十幾年來担任師範學校體靑敎學的經騐、和指導師範生到小學實習所見、雖然不敢說處處都是這樣、但至少多數是如此、他們所取的兒童體育訓練材料、惟一目的是省事、材料究竟不合兒童的要求、可說是完全置之不理的。</p>
<p>應用得最普遍的、就是打球、敎員上課、惟一的工具、就是一個皮　、一只號叫、幾條紅帶、打球並不是在小學裏絕對不可敎的、　只要敎得合法、也可以收效的、不過他們敎打球的時期、從學生能換球就開始、學生的體力勝任不勝任、不管的、敎打球的方法、一律用正式規則、學生學得會學不會、不管的、他們對敎打　所盡的責任、就是分分組、吹吹號叫、其他一切不管了了、</p>
<p>其次就是體操和遊戲、能够應用這種敎材的、己是不可多得、這種敎材、組看起來、程度似乎都是相等的、但實際上難易深淺、分得很淸、兒童生理心理發育的程序、各時不同、選擇敎材的合不合、影響他們的生理心理發育甚大、而我所見的各小學應用此種敎材、都是不管他適台於那一年級、同是取用一種村料、真正能够接着兒童發育的順序找取通宜的材料、或一種材料試騐之後、能夠加以適合不適合的研究的、可說沒有、</p>

<h3>能言的鸚鵡</h3>
<p>— 張向天</p>
<p>讀書鏡卷二有條引謝上蔡語云：</p>
<p>『透得名利關，方是小歇處，今之士大夫，眞能言之鸚鵡也。』</p>
<p>這是鄙賤一般士丈夫只知能說，而不能行的劣行而喻做『能言的鵡鸚。』宋代大理學家朱晦翁也會看淸了這一點，說過：『今時秀才直會說廉說義，及到做來只是不廉不　，』這正是能說不能行恰如『能言鸚鵡』一樣。這樣的『能言鸚鵡』同我們時代中的一般讀書階級比起來又差多少？</p>
<p>近些日子，本港不是有一派人大談「和平保實力」麼？但其實他們目的並不是為和平，不過欲行其私。使中國發生內亂，互相慘殺，所謂「保全實力」也者，只不過希望中國互相殘殺時，比西班牙更來得憐厲罷了。同時還特別給中華民族轉荐給一個嗜血的魔王，使其永伏在嗜血魔王的脚下，近衛聲明的響應，不過是奴化中國民族的第一聲而己。</p>
<p>如果問他們為甚麼竟是如此喪心病狂呢？大的理由也沒有，倒是透不過「名利關」之故，和謝上蔡的話正可照應，也就是朱子所說的「不廉不義」。</p>
<p>如果再問鸚鵡何以能言呢？不外學說而己，只要與一人，一派的名利有益的話，他們是十分會做人家的應聲虫的，同時拜人家為主于，為父母，一切　義等等，均亦就講不上了。不過鸚鵡能言的例子，也有例外，在劉元卿賢奕編卷三有一條足可引証：</p>
<p>『宋高宗宮中養鸚鵡數百，一日問之，　鄕否？對曰思鄉。遂遣中貴送還山中。後數年　有使臣過隴山，鸚鵡問曰：上皇安否？使臣曰，上皇崩矣。鸚鵡聞之，皆悲鳴不己。使臣賦詩曰，　口深草樹荒，行人到此斷肝腸，耳邊不忍聽鸚鵡，猶在枝頭說上皇。』</p>
<p>這類故審若不是忠心獻媚的軟骨文人造出來的那就可以稱一個例外了，因為鸚鵡不止能言，竟還能同人應答如流，但是若擴另一點來說，也沒有甚麼例外，倒底這些鸚鵡還是忠心主子的應聲虫，吃了皇上的飯，就不忠上皇的安否，聞了主子的崩死消息，也居然能悲嗚不巳。同時文人有了煙斯披里純，大降起「斷肝腸」的應聲虫詩，擴大的結果，有意無意都做了應聲虫的也加多了。</p>
<p>賢奕卷三又有一處寫着</p>
<p>「唐明皇所敎舞象，祿山亂，大宴胡酋，出舞象……象皆努目不動」。這又是一椿動物忠心主子的一個旁證。同書同卷又有：</p>
<p>「昭宗有猴，能隨班起居，賜排袍，號孫供奉，后朱全忠纂位，取猴令殿下起居，猴逕趨上跳躍奮擊……」。</p>
<p>這又是一段動物忠心的記事，如果細細追問這都是事實麼？倒不得見，這又是軟骨文人的技倆。</p>
<p>以上所舉似乎都有些相關聯，動物雖級屬下等　但却都滿了名利之欲，懂得献媚，故事做得都很圓滿，如果以小人之心度人，那麼手製這些動物忠孝感恩故事的軟骨文人的具有劣性，也不問可知了。</p>
<p>同書卷三又有一條云：</p>
<p>『程伯淳遊山，山僧云晏元献南來獼猴滿野，献為一絕云聞說獼猴性頗鹽，相車來便滿山迎，鞭嬴到此何會見，始覺毛虫也世情。』</p>
<p>實則絕句末尾的「始覺毛虫也世情」却是由於以小人之心度人的人們想出來的呵！</p>
<p>「透得名利關」的鸚鵡有沒有呢？</p>
<p>「賢奕編卷三云：「東都有人養鸚鵡，以具慧施於僧，僧敎之能誦經。往往架上不言不動，問其故，對曰身心供不動，為求無上道。及其死，焚之有舍利。」</p>
<p>這同鸚鵡鵡懷主子「悲鳴不己」，一樣都是造做出來的。能言不能行的鸚鵡，有時却又鈹裝點得可笑。</p>
<p>有人依然迷信凡事「名正」『言順』，事就可行，但看了鸚鵡的學舌，大慨也要失笑罷，何况彼輩所倡者名旣不正，言又不順的鸚鵡羣呢！</p>

<h3>戰犬偶談</h3>
<p>— 履平</p>
<p>自從人類有了戰爭，犬就開始加入他們的陣。</p>
<p>原始人在穴居野處的時候，犬做了他們的警衛者，帮助他們抵禦一切外來的侵略。</p>
<p>周代置「犬人」官制，為同寇之屬，專掌管犬性的敎養，雖未能證實當時將犬來用于戰爭，但犬之為人所訓練，是很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>從壁畫上我們可以有到埃及人在紀元前四千年己將犬作為戰爭的工具了。克勒特族人（Celt）用鋒利的鋼叨　在犬的頸圈上，驅使它去刺殺敵人。英王亨利第八八將四百頭猛犬送給查利第九，帮助西班牙人擊敗法國軍隊。至於犬之服役現代戰爭，從事救護，通訊，警哨等工作；是在第一次世界大戰時德國所創立的。</p>
<p>犬的嗅覺和聽覺到達能半英里以內，比較人類聰敏八倍。記憶力甚强，能辨聽出二百種以上的口號。</p>
<p>一只　國軍用，在猛烈的砲火下找尋五個傷兵的所地，復兵因得　全生命，一只比利時警犬在一年內造成了敎　二千人的紀錄。</p>
<p>在比國，戰犬編入機械化部隊；用它來拖機槍，具機　比較戰馬還司信任，在蘇聯，犬帶着防毒面具來　火綫上，專司袖　車大的　實，每一頭戰犬能帝四十五磅的藥彈，如果配着簡單的噐械，它也能當車隊裝置電話線。</p>
<p>法蘭西的一頭戰犬名叫「炳」的可算是戰犬中最光榮的一員了。它除了能做其他戰犬所能做的工作以外，更能辦得出毒烟彈的氣味，成千士　的性命　由它的警吿得以保存。因此它獲得許多榮譽獎，它更是第一頭得到國家恩餉的戰犬。當它老死的時候，是用軍禮來舉葬。</p>
<p>在歐洲今日，戰犬訓練成為普遍的事情了。英倫的成　查遜軍用犬學佼就是戰犬訓練的最大塲所，每期畢業的戰犬達二千頭。其他如沙，意，比，荷蘭等國，都有戰犬學校的設備，更有許專為戰犬設立的醫院，如傷兵醫院，情形一樣。</p>
<h3>老頭兒的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>尖冷的北風凶悍地掃打着村圍外的竹林，一種悽哀的吟　，不斷的隨着風勢播向遠方，正如苦難時代一切不幸者的寃訴。</p>
<p>從昨天起，這村莊的人民又像驚弓之鳥似的作不知到多少次的逃難了。大概是戰爭敎他們學會聰明吧？婦人和孩子定得一個不留，社丁呢，一些胆怯的逃了。一些堅强的据守在山頭上待機殺×。留下來的，除一些其頑不靈老頭兒，一些拚死守家的老太婆外，只有許多失了主人的家畜。</p>
<p>鵝嗚叫出了旭日。逃走的一羣才息下了疲怠的脚步，他們回望着二三十里外的分別僅一夜的田園廬舍，只見雲煙彌漫，遠樹和山峯綴織着一副朦朧的面影。他們的心上都畫上了一個可怕的謎：××鬼子把我們的家物怎樣處置了呢？但沒有人給他們的解答。</p>
<p>這一天，沒有出走的那些老頭兒也沒有好好地睡覺，鄕長楊尙義這老傢伙。更準備歡迎×人。幹這工作委實不容易，一壁要好好招待那些傳話漢奸；這倒不覺得怎麼大難；但另一壁還要叫那些後生的小夥子不抵抗，這就成問題了。然而，無論如何，他已决定要這樣做了。</p>
<p>第二天，慘淡的太　正要上昇的時候，十幾個×兵昂昂然到這個鄕村來了。漢好把他們直引到村裏祠堂來：那裏，正騵備好了一個醜態百出的『歡迎會』。</p>
<p>幾個昏續的老頭子穿着長袍，套上馬褂，還戴着紅樓帽子，三叩四揖地把×人招待到筵席上來。</p>
<p>×人狂喜地啜着酒漿，趁着酒興笑盈盈地立起身來，噥哩咕魯着。跟着，就有一個漢奸厚着面皮裝着笑臉翻抑；</p>
<p>「大××需要鷄××頭……」</p>
<p>穿着長袍馬掛的老頭子連忙回答：</p>
<p>「唔唔唔……好好好……」</p>
<p>「大××需要豬××頭……」</p>
<p>「唔唔……好好……』</p>
<p>「要白米××担……」</p>
<p>「唔唔……好好……』</p>
<p>「要牛××頭……』</p>
<p>「唔唔……好好……」</p>
<p>停了一刻，那翻譯的傢伙又說：</p>
<p>「還有，姑娘××個』</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>說到這句時，老頭子們彼此顧視着，默然無語，臉彼罩了一層凄慘的暗雲。</p>
<p>不一會，×兵趾高氣揚織走，定前，嚴膩地吩咐着！</p>
<p>「這一切東西要今天正午送來！」</p>
<p>到時，老頭子們聽了好些人，牽着牛，抬着鷄和猪，担看白米，並派了五個所謂『擅於調令』的老頭子做領導——富然，鄕長也是其中之一的。依照×兵先前指定的地點，把這許多『來處不易』的東西奉送給×人。</p>
<p>時間不早也不遲，時計的長短針剛巧重疊在這十二時的阿拉伯字上。但×兵却暴燥地呼喝起來：</p>
<p>『哈，怎麼這樣遲才送來呢！』</p>
<p>『現在剛才十二點，先生！』鄕長老頭子用女人一樣和柔的聲音說。</p>
<p>另一個×兵，他的肩上有點特別的記號，大概就是什麼鳥隊長吧，他檢視一下送來的東西，隨卽竪起了濃眉，做着比鬼子更可怕的臉，用鼻子吁了一聲，然後暍罵道：</p>
<p>「為什麼不送姑娘來！」這話是從那個無恥的漢奸口裏傳出來的。</p>
<p>五個老頭兒都嚇得臉色轉靑又轉白，發抖得鬍子也顫動了，鄉長老頭子打了一個寒噤，用抖顫的聲調說：</p>
<p>『先生因為女兒走了，一時無法送來，以後……』</p>
<p>聲昔還沒有完，就被一句聽不懂的話暍住了。</p>
<p>那肩上有標記的×兵對另外的×兵說了一句什麼鬼話後，應聲而起的就有幾個×兵揮起亮光光的槍刺，走向幾個胆不附魂的老頭兒的身邊來。</p>
<p>像刀劍挿入黏土般嗤的一聲，跟着，空中蕩起了幾聲慘叫；于是，在那莽莽的衰草上，就橫陳着五條枯乾的屍體了。寒風呼呼地為他們唱起了輓歌。</p>
<p>但×乓呢。含着笑，收起了送來的東西，及計劃着另一個新行動了。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>那女僕放下衣扣，又給他拭着肩上的雪水，越　經驗的僕人，越在客人的面前，玩卉小殷勤；有時候，直到肉麻，還不止住。像她　就是那樣的。這位被她招待的客人，被招待得幾乎侷促了；最後，他躱避了她，問她：</p>
<p>『小姐呢？』</p>
<p>『唉，眞糊塗—我忘記給先生找小姐去啦。』</p>
<p>『不忙。』</p>
<p>『是的，我也是這樣想，先生不妨多坐一坐，外面的天氣，可眞冷！……』</p>
<p>『還是你先去請小姐來吧！』</p>
<p>『是的，我這就去。』</p>
<p>他又喚回她來，他問：</p>
<p>『小姐在那里？』</p>
<p>『在客廳。』</p>
<p>『還有客人嗎？』</p>
<p>『沒有。她一個人在那里練習鋼琴，先生，你不知道小姐是愛彈綱琴的嗎？他的朋友都知道啊！說起她的朋友來，可眞太好啦，我就沒有看過一個壞人。我們小姐可眞沒白長那對鳳眼，她可真認識朋友！』這多話的女僕，說起話來的時的候，彷彿永不停止。他一邊無心地聽着，想着：</p>
<p>『你這個多嘴的老太婆，你年靑的時候，是啞巴嗎？』她以為自己的話可以討到客人的歡心，她不知道，結果，正是相反；所以她仍是繼續地說着：『說起他的朋友來，可眞太好啦！還都像大命人呢！』這時候，他想說：</p>
<p>『我像你的祖宗！』</p>
<p>『比方，先生，你的福相，一定是作大事的，兒女雙全，一直到老。那時候，先生，你不要忘記這還有一個可憐的老太婆，她還和你談過話。』他聽着，巳經氣憤了，他要喊：</p>
<p>『這個老太婆，一定要用公馬的生殖器，才能堵住娥的嘴！』（九）</p>

<h3>Current Financial and Economic Issues: On the Achievements of the Second Local Financial Conference</h3>
<p>Since the commencement of the second phase of the War of Resistance, new changes have taken place in military and political affairs. Financial and economic issues have been elevated to a critical stage. The most pressing difficulty to address is the tax revenue problem. In the past, China's annual income relied heavily on indirect taxes such as customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes, accounting for over 70% of the total annual income. However, since the War of Resistance, the successive fall of important ports and economic centers such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Hankou, as well as the blockade or disruption of other ports, has hindered foreign trade, severely impacting customs revenue. Salt-producing areas like Changlu and Lianghuai have been occupied, resulting in significant losses in national salt tax revenue. The successive fall or disruption of coastal industrial centers has also led to a sharp decline in consolidated tax revenue. Second is the foreign exchange problem: In an attempt to undermine China's legal tender system, the Japanese established a puppet reserve bank to issue overseas Chinese currency, using it to absorb legal tender in exchange for foreign exchange. More recently, on the 15th of this month, they implemented a ban on the circulation of legal tender and enforced foreign exchange controls in occupied areas. Their various despicable methods to undermine our currency system and exacerbate our foreign exchange difficulties can be described as leaving no stone unturned. Third is the price problem: Since the successive loss of major trading ports, prices in various regions have undergone drastic scissor-like changes. On the one hand, the prices of all imported goods have skyrocketed; on the other hand, the prices of agricultural products have plummeted due to the inability to export them flexibly to other regions. Therefore, the adverse impact on the wartime national economy is incalculable. Furthermore, as a result of the development of the War of Resistance, transportation in various regions has become more difficult, and the country's financial economy, the people's economic livelihood, and production enterprises have all suffered considerable adverse impacts. These are extremely serious problems that urgently need to be resolved for the entire nation's War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance convened the Second Local Financial Conference a few days ago. Its main task was to seek to strengthen local financial institutions, expand their business, and foster close cooperation between the central government and local authorities, in order to assist production enterprises, promote local financial strength, and adapt to the new needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The significance of seeking to resolve the financial and economic problems of the second phase of the War of Resistance cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The conference closed on the 10th of this month and issued a declaration on the 15th. We express our utmost respect to the leadership spirit of the supreme leader and the financial authorities, as well as to the economic and financial leaders from all regions who, after receiving their orders, traveled to Chongqing for the meeting, regardless of distance or danger, to fulfill the duties of people from all walks of life during wartime. We also wish to express our views on the achievements of this conference and the expectations after the meeting for reference. The main theme of this financial conference was to address the important financial and economic problems at the current stage and to discuss plans to increase production, promote exports, balance prices, provide relief to the people, and develop resources. Furthermore, it explored the wartime financial and economic connections and cooperation with each other, in order to mobilize our country's financial resources, utilize the economic power of the entire nation, and crush the Japanese conspiracy to blockade the economy and undermine finance, in order to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance and building the nation. Based on the basic principles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Program and the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session and the Third Session of the People's Political Council, the conference, taking into account the specific environment and conditions of various regions, largely decided on concrete measures and formulated various plans for the original tasks. Among them, the following items are particularly noteworthy:</p>
<p>First, it was firmly recognized that "economic mobilization is a key factor in determining victory or defeat in modern warfare, and the sound organization and promotion of business of financial institutions are essential for strengthening the economy and striving for victory." Therefore, it was decided that all participants, upon returning to their respective regions, should do their best to promote local financial strength and economic development, that is, to concentrate the scattered economic forces of various regions to assist the central government in the success of various financial policies. Concrete decisions were also made on how to resist the use of Japanese puppet banknotes in the war zone, prevent the utilization of materials from the war zone, stabilize prices in areas outside the war zone, develop production enterprises, and concentrate the scattered gold and silver hidden among the people. Second, it was firmly recognized that "the prosperity and decline of the financial industry is a matter of overall interest: in the past, the financial industry in various regions may have focused solely on the interests of one province or one bank without paying attention to the overall situation, which was the main reason why the national financial and economic policies could not be implemented." Therefore, it was decided that the financial industry in various regions should henceforth uniformly follow the overall national policy, move towards the overall national economy, and provinces and the central government, provinces and provinces, and provinces and counties should further strengthen their ties, eliminate barriers, and work together. This can be said to be a major resolution for establishing a united anti-Japanese front in the financial sector. Third, it was firmly recognized that "to win economic victories in the rear of the Japanese, the first priority is to control the economic center of the war zone and consolidate the economic barrier of the war zone." Therefore, it was decided that financial operators in various regions must work together to ensure that the various industries operated by compatriots in the war zone can provide us with economic or financial convenience, and that materials in the war zone can be absorbed as much as possible for our exports, and that personnel needs can be fully met. Fourth, it was firmly recognized that the supreme leader's instruction that "the Japanese blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic revival" is the basic principle for national economic revival. It was also decided that the financial community in various regions should, with concerted efforts and continuous efforts, enable the inland economy to quickly revive through division of labor and cooperation in the shortest possible time, and that the mining, industrial, commercial and other industries should be provided with ample capital to improve their operations, so that the production enterprises in various sectors can achieve the greatest prosperity and the fastest growth under the economic conditions and economic environment that are most suitable for us now. In addition, the conference also clearly expressed two points in the declaration: First, regarding local finance, it was decided to sincerely follow the outline of measures to improve local financial institutions announced by the First Financial Conference, the measures to adjust local finance adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session, the various plans for the financial and economic handling of the war zone, and the resolutions of the Third Session of the National Political Council on finance and economy, and to work together to further implement them concretely. Second, regarding the acquisition of foreign assistance, it was decided that the financial institutions of each province and region should do their best and fulfill their duties, and work together under the principles advocated by the supreme leader and inspired by the central authorities, in order to obtain more cooperation from friendly countries, so that our economic revival can be even faster.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that after this financial conference, the financial and economic problems in our country's second phase of the War of Resistance will be resolved to a considerable extent. However, in order to thoroughly solve these problems and truly achieve the goal of mobilizing the entire nation's financial and economic power to serve the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, it seems that we should also require the people and the government to make greater efforts to realize the following points, namely: First, we must perfectly achieve the requirement of "those who have money contribute money," resolutely expand the income tax, implement the inheritance tax, and increase the tax rates on all luxury goods, while abolishing the harsh and miscellaneous taxes and the apportionment system, in order to ease the burden on the people and benefit tax revenue. Second, we must combine political mobilization with government decrees to expand the solicitation of public bonds and the donation movement, and mobilize the people to voluntarily donate money and grain to supply the anti-Japanese army and enrich financial revenue. The recent donation movement in Chongqing has achieved excellent results, especially among women, whose donations have been exceptionally enthusiastic. We believe that as long as the publicity is appropriate and the mobilization is good, this movement is a major force to help the country successfully implement its financial and economic policies in the future, so it should be promoted more widely under the unified leadership of the government, especially among overseas Chinese. Third, we must promote the thrift movement, especially focusing on improving the past corrupt lives of people above the middle class, limiting their waste, and presenting all their wasted money as donations to the nation. At the same time, we must pay attention to (1) vigorously practicing incorruptibility, revising the salary system, and stipulating an equal salary system according to the minimum living standard; (2) abolishing feudal and wasteful customs and improving social customs, not only to preserve vitality for the national finances, but also to establish a foundation for future national construction in advance. Fourth, we must step up international publicity and strive for foreign loans and other practical assistance. In addition, regarding the development of production and construction undertakings and the establishment of new economic centers, we believe that we still need to focus on the following points, namely: (1) National banks should expand the provision of low-interest loans to assist the development of production undertakings and the circulation of commodities; (2) continue to persist in the struggle to eliminate the Japanese policy of undermining the legal tender, and at the same time assist isolated areas in establishing local banks and issuing local paper money; (3) protect the free business of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and at the same time pay attention to the development of cooperative enterprises; (4) in the future, production undertakings should focus on national defense industries necessary for the War of Resistance and the industries of necessities for the people during wartime, and at the same time improve the labor law and factory management system to protect the material treatment of production workers, so as to ensure the practical improvement of productivity.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Foreign Investment in China</h3>
<p>— Translated by Liang Chen</p>
<p>Translator's Note: The original author is Ner Man Hanwell, and the original article was published in "Asia Magazine" and reprinted by the Shanghai Miller's Review (Issue No. 9, January 28, 1939). The author believes that there are three possible outcomes of the Sino-Japanese War: the first is Japan's complete conquest of China. The author believes this is impossible; the second is a temporary armed truce after Japan occupies part of Chinese territory, but China will inevitably continue to resist until it recovers its lost territory; the third is China's ultimate victory. In the first two possible outcomes, foreign commerce in China has no future. Only if China wins the war of resistance will foreign investment in China be profitable. From this, it can be seen that China's victory in the war of resistance is not only what the Chinese people are hoping for day and night, but also what foreign capitalists are happy to hear. Foreign capitalists clearly see that only if China wins the final victory will their investments in China have hope. Therefore, for their own benefit, they will inevitably help our country as much as possible.</p>
<p>Although the current Sino-Japanese War is far from its end, some people are already discussing future problems, especially regarding the role foreign enterprises will play in future reconstruction. Neither China nor Japan has sufficient capital to engage in construction, so the position of foreign investors seems very important. This is similar to the situation in Europe after being devastated by the last World War. If we review the past and analyze current trends, we can roughly predict the potential future of foreign investors.</p>
<p>Let's first assume that Japan will win in the future—an assumption the author believes will not come true. However, some people believe that although Japan will inevitably lose all its vitality, victory will still belong to her. If this is the case, what investment or trade opportunities will countries other than Japan have? Japan's economic structure was already unsound before the war, and now it is even more exhausted due to the prolongation of the war. Of course, it can only allocate a very small portion of capital to reconstruction. However, is providing capital to Japan to enable it to exploit the Chinese people beneficial to foreign investors?</p>
<p>The result of the Sino-Japanese War is generally this: closing the door to foreign direct investment. This can be seen from Japan's establishment of new enterprises and expansion of existing enterprises. Most of these exaggerated plans come from Tokyo, with the aim of establishing a monopolistic system in all aspects. This not only serves as an advance warning to non-Japanese investors who want to enter China, but also severely threatens foreign enterprises with a long history in Chinese territories that have fallen into Japanese hands. The right to navigate inland rivers is now only enjoyed by Japanese shipping companies. In addition to forcing existing Chinese enterprises to practice "Sino-Japanese cooperation," the Japanese have also established huge new joint-stock companies in China. The Huazhong Development Company has a capital of 100 million yen and has the right to invest and coordinate the finances of various enterprises "for public welfare and industrial development." These so-called industries include transportation, electricity, gas, water, minerals, aquatic products, and "other industries related to public welfare." A larger but similar organization has been established in North China with a capital of 390 million yen. Obviously, these all-encompassing semi-official organizations only create large-scale monopolies like those in "Manchukuo." Given this situation, can we blame foreign businessmen for feeling that investing in Japanese-occupied areas is unreliable?</p>
<p>Many people feel that the most detrimental sign for foreign commerce in China if Japan wins is the attempt to link Chinese currency with the Japanese yen. There is ample reason for this. If Chinese currency is attached to the Japanese yen group, foreign countries will be forced to abandon a large portion of their existing trade with China. After the currencies of the two countries are linked, economic management and restrictions will inevitably be implemented, and foreign trade will decline. As a certain political commentator pointed out: "Strict restrictions and political rule will result in the misfortune of foreign commerce in China." Imports from countries other than Japan will be suppressed in order to maintain the managed currency, which will give Japanese goods a good opportunity to enter. Furthermore, according to the already announced procedures for demanding reparations from China after the war, it is enough to foresee that China's import and export trade will be strictly managed and occupied by Japan.</p>
<p>Indirect investment may have better prospects, that is, providing capital to these huge Japanese monopoly enterprises. The Japanese have worked hard to attract foreign capital to develop "Manchukuo," and they will use this attempt to develop Central and Western China in the future. Naturally, many Japanese feel that if they want to complete their plans, it is necessary to attract foreign investment. A leader of a large-scale enterprise in China once admitted: "The economic development of Shanghai and South China requires huge investment. Japan itself does not have such great strength, so it hopes to obtain low-interest capital from Britain, the United States, and France." There are countless similar statements, and they are undoubtedly sincere. Needless to say, not all Japanese people hold this view. The business leader just mentioned also admitted this, saying: "Some Japanese people oppose the use of foreign capital because investors tend to take excessive actions." He also said that when the extent of these excessive actions by foreign investors is too great, "we will try to improve the situation." This kind of restriction by the Japanese on foreign investment only makes investors hesitate and consider before investing. When Japan's monopoly destroys foreign commerce, even the "die-hards" in Shanghai will think: "It is impossible for foreign capitalists to watch their interests being destroyed and at the same time help the Japanese to exploit their interests with funds."</p>
<p>We have found that many influential Japanese people firmly advocate that the right to invest in China should belong entirely to them. These Japanese people, like those who advocate "Asia for Asians" (the idealistic saying is "China for the Japanese"), want Japan to monopolize the benefits of victory. Their excuse is that if there are benefits, they were obtained by the Japanese military spending huge amounts of Japanese lives and Japanese money on military operations. The Japanese people are sacrificing their lives and bearing extra taxes because of the war, and propagating this gospel to them is obvious. Nationalism is not a specialty of Japan, but nationalism will have a strong impact on foreign investment in China, whether direct or indirect.</p>
<p>The Japanese also have a long-standing belief that the Chinese are incapable of self-government. Therefore, promoting a Chinese government will lead to foreign oppression, and the force influencing China should and must be Japan. Even the authoritative Japanese industrial publication "Oriental Economist" has said: "If China's economy is to develop smoothly, Japan needs to be dominant in China." Even the less nationalistic publications in Japan adopt this attitude, which is naturally not a good omen for non-Japanese investment, especially when observing the position of foreign investors in areas directly or indirectly governed by the Japanese government, it is even less optimistic.</p>
<p>As China continued to lose larger cities, especially after losing Guangzhou and Hankou, Japan's attitude of wanting to monopolize China became more aggressive than before. Japan has regarded China as a Japanese vassal, like Manchukuo. Konoe's statement last November declared that Japan's purpose was to "establish a new order that guarantees permanent stability in East Asia," "establish political, economic, cultural, and other mutual assistance and equality between Japan, 'Manchukuo,' and China." One of the main goals is to realize the "economic close connection" of all of East Asia. Regardless of whether this goal is right or wrong, it will not have the results they want if it does not destroy existing foreign enterprises or damage their potential future markets in the Far East. The new chairman of the Huazhong Development Company, when the company was formally established, declared that Japan had no intention of monopolizing China, nor would it interfere with existing foreign enterprises. At the same time, he denied the urgent need for foreign capital. Although he made statements that would not exclude foreign interests, the implementation of the actual plan is tantamount to closing the market for existing or planned foreign enterprises.</p>
<p>In short, the merger of all-encompassing monopolistic enterprises, strict currency management and unavoidable commercial restrictions, restrictions on allowing foreigners to participate in indirect investment, and the threat of establishing superiority in newly occupied areas all make people feel that foreign enterprises are unsafe in China under Japanese rule.</p>
<p>Above, the author expressed a personal opinion that Japan will not win the current war. What is the reason for this? The most obvious reason is the slow progress of the Japanese army and the neglect of organizing the occupied areas. From this, it can be seen that it is very questionable whether the Japanese army can achieve complete victory. The geographical difficulties of the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan can determine that Japan will not achieve complete victory. Furthermore, conflicts on the Soviet-Japanese border may occur at any time. This spark on the border between Manchuria and Siberia could become a prairie fire. If this becomes a reality, then the main force of the Japanese army will probably be used to deal with a more powerful northern enemy.</p>
<p>If Japan does not win, what will happen? One possibility is that the situation will remain temporarily unchanged, with Japan occupying certain areas while China retains its inland provinces. This is nothing more than an armed truce.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, what are the prospects for foreign investors in Japanese-occupied areas? This will generally not be better than the result of Japan's victory, or even worse. The vast guerrillas in the rear of the Japanese army will never stop their activities because Japan has stopped its offensive. Even now, Japan can only occupy important cities and railways in China, and outside of cities and railways, it is completely dominated by Chinese guerrillas. They often sabotage Japanese military and supply lines. When large Japanese troops invade, the guerrillas are relatively silent. When the main force of the Japanese army passes or the garrison forces are reduced, the guerrilla attacks begin again. They will not stop attacking, allowing the Japanese to calmly consolidate and build up the economy in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>The Chinese guerrillas themselves are not only very active, but also receive government assistance and encouragement to recover the lost territories seized by the Japanese army. Japan is incapable of conquering China, but China will not be incapable of continuing to harass the Japanese army, making Japan's aggression unprofitable. In fact, China will temporarily disrupt all Japanese economic plans from its unconquerable base, just as the guerrillas do. Such a prospect is certainly not conducive to foreign investors, even if investors only want to invest through Japanese-managed organizations, such investment is unprofitable.</p>
<p>China will be greatly weakened by this war, and after the war, it must use its weakened economic strength to shoulder the responsibility of reconstruction. There is considerable reason for this frugality. The Japanese aggression has caused extensive damage to China, and China itself has destroyed it due to military needs. Various bombings and tens of thousands of refugees have migrated and become displaced due to the war. These reasons combined will inevitably cause extremely serious problems for China. A large part of China's productive capacity has been destroyed, and at the same time, consumption power has increased, and this consumption demand must be satisfied from the weakened productive capacity. This situation seems to be enough to prove that the view of a British China expert is correct, who said: "The Chinese countryside is once again falling into ××××, and the chaos we are accustomed to is once again before our eyes." That's right, last spring, the area north of the Yellow River fell into chaos due to the rapid southward advance of the Japanese army. There was a period when there was no government rule. However, what do we find in the north now? According to reliable sources, the chaotic situation there has not only reached a very small extent, but everything under the management of the guerrillas is more advanced than before the war. If such a movement can grow up behind the Japanese army, then in the areas ruled by the Chinese, can't the same organization be established to replace the rule of bandits and warlords?</p>
<p>Mr. Maco, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hankou, said in a speech last year: "A government in such difficult and difficult circumstances, in such urgent need of funds to support itself, will eventually resort to extreme means." The author does not agree with this view. Any tendency to autocratic monopoly cannot resist the Chinese people's tendency towards democracy. In this war of resistance, which requires the whole nation to support it wholeheartedly, Chinese farmers have already enjoyed certain rights. Once they are satisfied with these rights, they will naturally fight to insist on these rights without letting go. Therefore, the author believes that political dictatorship will not occur.</p>
<p>If Mr. Maco meant the economic policies prevalent in extremely nationalistic countries, then from the perspective of foreign enterprises, it is worth considering. The difficulty of China's currency management will inevitably force the Chinese government to further restrict foreign exchange; and this restriction is still increasing. In the end, it will force the implementation of barter trade with foreign countries. The government's commercial organizations will also continue to increase at the same time, and trade will be transformed into government or semi-official monopolies. Even before the start of the Chinese War of Resistance, foreign merchants were concerned about the Chinese government's attitude towards trade. The tea trade and tung oil trade are now managed by government agencies. Regarding the former, the Chinese government's original intention was to improve the export trade of tea, and a British tea expert was hired to do the work. However, this Chinese Tea Company has now become a competitor of merchants. The Chinese Vegetable Oil Company has also developed into a competitor of merchants, rather than a purely improving vegetable oil purpose organization. These new government organizations will continue to compete with merchants. As Mr. Maco pointed out in his speech: "Due to the difficulty of balancing barter trade, more and more commodities are controlled by the government. At the same time, high interference will be imposed on private enterprises." In addition to these organizations, there are also several enterprises completely monopolized by the government, and the tung industry and antimony industry are two of them.</p>
<p>If we want to determine the future of foreign enterprises in China, we must know that the Chinese government's ultimate goal is to recover lost territories. Therefore, purely profit-seeking foreign enterprises have few opportunities in a divided China.</p>
<p>The third possibility—China's victory—is the final outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. Because of the second possibility, that is, a part of Chinese territory is ruled by Japan, it is only a temporary armed truce. China will inevitably continue the war of resistance until it completely recovers its lost territories. However, a completely independent China after victory will make people suspicious, fearing that China's extreme nationalist ideas will hinder foreign interests.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly stated that she will devote herself to internal construction and has no aggressive intentions of modern nationalism. However, they may use nationalistic ideas internally. They can build an economy that completely belongs to China and try their best to avoid foreign management, which will conflict with the interests of foreign investors.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, commercial restrictions and controls implemented for military convenience are necessary in countries at war. It is a matter of course to implement various policies for the sake of national survival. China's destruction is so great that it will naturally need all available resources for future reconstruction. China's needs are so great that she will naturally try her best to establish a new modern economy, to produce and maintain a favorable commercial balance, and to increase foreign exchange to purchase materials that China does not have. This will cause official companies to conflict with foreign commercial interests to some extent.</p>
<p>Now let us study the issue of investing in the form of loans. For example, loans to repair or extend or build new railways. These new plans are of course implemented by the government or semi-official companies. However, it is also obvious that China needs foreign funds or credit assistance. The profits of investors will not come from monopolies but from the increase in commerce and production. Legitimate foreign investment can obtain reasonable profits, and this profit is almost certain to be obtained. However, this kind of investment cannot be compared with any previous loans, which could generate extra huge profits at once.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the future of foreign enterprises in China, we believe that in any case, it will never be the same as before, when China had internal strife and people boldly dared to plunder. Of course, there are few investment opportunities if investors want to invest in the form of previous loans. Among the three possible outcomes of the Sino-Japanese War discussed above, if two of them become reality, there are few opportunities for large-scale foreign investment to gain a foothold. Whether China will be occupied by a part of Japanese territory and China will first recuperate and then continue the war of resistance, or China will be completely conquered by Japan, neither of these two possible outcomes has opportunities for foreign investment. China's victory in the war of resistance, although everything will be considered for the benefit of the Chinese people, is still the most favorable result for foreign investment.</p>
<p>To put it simply, from the purposes of China and Japan, we can know that under certain circumstances, there will be more opportunities for foreign investment: Japan is determined to keep China in a semi-colonial state and forever dependent on Japan. She wants to use China as her market and source of raw materials. On the contrary, China only wants to regain independence and establish a self-sufficient economy. If there are opportunities for foreign enterprises in China to develop, it will only be after China wins the war of resistance and when China rebuilds its economy.</p>
<h3>The Demise of Japanese Liberals</h3>
<p>— Originally by贺赛尔 (He Sai'er) (1) Originally published in "Asia Magazine"</p>
<p>Japanese liberals have now disappeared. In a country ruled by soldiers who are engaged in a war of aggression, there is naturally no room for liberals. Thought itself is contraband, and the minds of general liberals are full of dangerous ideas. This is naturally very suspicious in Japan. A communist who organizes radical farmers, or a troublemaker who incites labor strikes, is certainly quite dangerous, but a liberal is much more dangerous than them. Because his thinking is essentially part of an imported worldview.</p>
<p>Who represents this dangerous stage? There are no definite boundaries or standards. We cannot say that every intellectual is a liberal, and in fact, many intellectuals have already transformed and are singing "sincere cooperation." But the intellectual circle is still the main base of free thought. General professors have become the number one enemy of the country because of their own education and their close contact with the youth.</p>
<p>In Tokyo alone, there are now almost twenty university professors detained there, and the number in other places is unknown. The person in charge of the ideological department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department once said that most of these criminals are stubborn and cannot be changed. They have tried every means to transform the thinking of those most unwanted young professors, but they have not succeeded. Previously, a young professor of economics was arrested for ideological problems. Every day, a senior official went to the prison to talk to him, and later told him that as long as he published an article in a magazine denying his previous views, he could immediately regain his freedom. But until now, he has not agreed to this method. There is also a professor of political science who was forced to resign for ideological problems. Later, he had to write film criticism to make a living, but he still continued to express his opinions between the lines, so he was eventually arrested. Now in Japan, there are several universities, including Tokyo Imperial University, that must first seek the consent of the police department when hiring faculty and staff. In other words, the current university professors are all appointed by the police department.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is the general students who are most severely suppressed by the police. Before Hitler fully established his authority in Germany, he had already firmly grasped the national student circle, but the situation in Japan is the opposite. Now the young intellectual circle in Japan is being driven by an amazing spirit of freedom. They do not believe in the benefits of fascism, and they generally disapprove of imperialism and the policy of aggression. They secretly hide Marx's books and like to joke with the current rulers. It's even worse if you have a private conversation with them. Several students told me that according to their method, Japan's monarchy will be "cleaned up" in a few decades. People who are familiar with how dignified the Japanese royal family is will be surprised when they hear them say such things.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department certainly knows these things, so arrests often occur near various universities. Many students are arrested by the police in coffee shops without being able to say what crime they committed, so they have to waste their studies. Several places in the Tokyo University district where people play mahjong have even hung up signs saying, "We guarantee that we will not arrest people again in the future."</p>
<p>Japanese students do not live in dormitories, so the above places have become places for them to gather in public and exchange ideas. These fiery young people have various ideas, but most of them are not dangerous. They are not organized, and after leaving school in a few years, they are absorbed by various professional groups. In these professional groups, their spirit will naturally undergo a new round of molding. As for those famous troublemaking leaders, there are also clever ways to deal with them, that is, first lock them up in a police station, release them after a considerable period of time, and then immediately have another police station arrest them. This makes it easy to waste some years, and they don't have to spend a penny.</p>
<p>In addition to various academics, liberal ideas can also be found among businessmen. Not long ago, two important figures in the business world had a private dinner in the private room of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations to discuss the best way to regulate the national economy. One of them could not agree with the current government's various methods, such as wasteful systems, and as a result, he came to a shocking conclusion that "the budgets of the army and navy should be reduced to a reasonable level." His companion also expressed great approval after hearing this. Looking out from the window there, he could see the new building of Mitsui &amp; Co., but construction had been stopped because the military could not approve it. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Great Victory of Our Army in Northwestern Shanxi Province; Annihilation of Thousands of Invaders at Liminbao; Bai Chongxi Discusses the War Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 15th] Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwestern Headquarters, hosted over eighty people from the cultural sector on the 14th, including Ma Junwu and Li Siguang. During the gathering, Bai Chongxi stated that the nature of the current war against Japan is one of resistance and response. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the key to victory lies in total war, fighting on all fronts – political, economic, and cultural. Although the work of cultural figures is primarily in the rear, their contribution to the war effort is no less significant than that of the brave soldiers at the front. He noted that since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese have not been as aggressive militarily as before. Their intention is to establish puppet regimes in our guerrilla areas and engage in economic aggression. Therefore, in the second phase of the war of resistance, we have decided to adopt a defensive posture militarily and an offensive posture politically. At the Fifth Plenary Session, resolutions were passed to establish the Supreme National Defense Council and the Political Affairs Committee, aiming to make political measures more flexible and to strengthen political institutions in various guerrilla areas. Furthermore, we will use military and political power to implement anti-blockade and anti-suppression policies to thwart Japan's economic aggression. As for areas along the Yangtze River, such as Nanchang and Changsha, it is not impossible for the Japanese to advance further, but the gains or losses of small areas are not significantly related to the future of the war. Regarding the northwest, although the Japanese claim they will attack Lanzhou and seize Xi'an, the success of our comprehensive war tactics in Shanxi means that the Japanese ambitions will be difficult to achieve. This can be predicted. As for the southwest, we do not fear the Japanese coming to attack us; rather, we fear that they will not advance. The terrain and manpower of these two areas alone are more than enough to strike the Japanese. As long as the Chinese people can establish a strong sense of determination, without fear or retreat, regardless of status, everyone should be willing to die for the cause. We will never be conquered by other countries, he concluded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 15th] After a certain fresh force of our army arrived in Shuoning, Northwestern Shanxi immediately achieved an unprecedented victory this year. On the evening of the 11th, Japanese troops invaded Liminbao south of Shuo County. Our army, taking advantage of the Japanese's unstable footing, preemptively launched a surprise attack, killing over a thousand enemy soldiers. On the 12th, we successfully recovered the fort, and the remaining Japanese troops fled. At night, our army launched an attack, occupying various suburban areas northwest of the city. The Japanese troops retreated into the city. When the Japanese reinforced, our army voluntarily withdrew, capturing many guns, flags, and food supplies. Further news stated that on the 13th, the Japanese were defeated by our forces in Qiangjiagou and the northwestern mountains of Heilongguan, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing back to Heilongguan.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 16th] On the evening of the 11th, Japanese troops from Ningwu invaded Liminbao. According to a pre-arranged plan, our army launched a large-scale night raid that evening. After fierce fighting until the 12th, the Japanese forces collapsed and fled towards Xinzhuang. Our army recovered Liminbao. In this battle, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and many spoils of war were captured. The Japanese troops in Shenchi are extremely panicked.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Chang'an City, 15th] On the 5th, our army launched a counterattack on Zhongyang, destroying two enemy communication lines and approaching the suburbs, engaging the Japanese in fierce fighting. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 16th] In the past week or so, battles have occurred in Xushui, Gaoyang, Hejian, Raoyang, Xianxian, and other places east of the Pinghan Railway, as well as in Yixian, Mancheng, and other places west of the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese attempt to "mop up" our guerrilla forces in these areas. However, due to the mobility of our army, not only were we not "mopped up," but we also launched counterattacks, inflicting significant blows. In total, it is estimated that over a thousand Japanese soldiers have been killed in various locations, and many spoils of war have been seized. During these guerrilla battles, we have received assistance from the people. The people risked artillery fire to transport food and ammunition. This has become a common phenomenon. Even elderly women in their sixties and seventies bravely provided food, drinks, and comfort items, greatly encouraging the courage of the soldiers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 16th] In Ding'an Longmen City, Japanese forces recently clashed with our guerrillas, resulting in over four hundred Japanese soldiers killed. The bodies were transported to Fucheng for cremation. It is estimated that over a thousand Japanese invaders have died in Qiong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 16th] According to the Air Defense Department, yesterday, when two Japanese planes bombed Pingjiang, the Pusu Hospital, which was run by the British, was completely destroyed. Doctor Li Jieban was killed in the bombing. The Peiyuan School outside the hospital was also completely destroyed, and about forty students were killed. Over a thousand houses were damaged. The entire city has been turned into a scorched earth.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Weisha, 16th] Nine Japanese planes, in two groups, reconnoitered over Shanggao, Pingxiang, Wanzai, and other counties in Jiangxi Province on the afternoon of the 16th. Six of them wreaked havoc in the Xinyu area.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>—March 8th to 14th—</p>
<p>Published by the Military Affairs Commission</p>
<p>In the past week, the Japanese forces on various fronts in the north and south have shown signs of exhaustion. Our momentum is increasing, and the Japanese strength is diminishing. A summary of the battles is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Province</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in the suburbs of Guangzhou have continued to increase recently, and they are still constructing fortifications to defend to the death. Japanese troops who occupied Dagangling and Mao'erling on the 7th were attacked by a part of our artillery on the 8th, resulting in over three hundred enemy casualties. After capturing those two locations, the remaining Japanese troops retreated to Shengang. Over four hundred Japanese troops came to reinforce them from the countryside. On the 9th, they advanced towards Gangkeng and Zhengguo to probe our strength, while another unit scurried towards Xianggangling, but they were all defeated. In the battles of Xianggang and Taikeng, the Japanese suffered over four hundred casualties. The Japanese now dare not act rashly. On the 11th, our attacking forces, along with the troops of unit ten, jointly attacked the Japanese entrenched near Wei, resulting in a fierce battle lasting until noon. Over two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese forces, unable to withstand the assault, retreated towards the street. On the same day, a unit of our air force bombed Xin Street and Taipingchang, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. On Hainan Island, our troops launched fierce attacks on Longmen City in Ding'an and Dongxi in Qiongshan on the previous two days, killing a total of five to six hundred Japanese soldiers. They have now directly approached the suburbs of the two county towns, besieging the Japanese. In anger, the Japanese have indiscriminately massacred able-bodied men in the cities, causing widespread suffering among the people. The Japanese troops in various parts of the island are intensifying the construction of fortifications to defend against our attacks, while our troops and civilians are cooperating to kill the Japanese, and their momentum is growing stronger.</p>
<p>Hubei Province</p>
<p>Since the Japanese forces in central Hubei occupied Zhongxiang last week, they have suffered over six thousand casualties and are now at the end of their strength. Our troops in various areas have been actively engaging them. Changshoudian, Yangzizhen, Yonglonghe, and Xiantaozhen have all been successively recovered by our forces, with many spoils of war captured. The arrogance of the Japanese has been greatly diminished. Although we only briefly recovered Yangjiaze, Yanjiazhen, Taipingchang, Lujiayan, Renjiaji, Yanmenkou, and other places, the losses suffered by the Japanese were beyond their expectations. Currently, the Japanese forces in the east are being pressured on the east bank of the Xiang River and are constantly firing artillery westward in an attempt to hold their ground. As for the Japanese troops in the Zhe River area, they once advanced west of Yujiadian this week, but were met with a fierce counterattack by our forces, resulting in over two hundred Japanese casualties. They have now shrunk back and are not making any further movements. In southern Hubei, our army has repeatedly attacked the Japanese troops, inflicting heavy casualties, especially on the Japanese entrenched at Tanyuan Pass on the border of Yangxin and Daye. It is estimated that over six hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese abandoned over one hundred bodies. After the repeated mutinies of the puppet troops in various places in eastern Hubei, the Japanese have been unable to maintain the puppet regime. Currently, all the county towns and towns are under the control of our guerrillas. Including last week, the total war results achieved by our guerrilla units in the past month are estimated to be over two thousand five hundred Japanese soldiers killed and a large number of prisoners captured. The elite Japanese troops are nearing exhaustion and cannot be replenished.</p>
<p>Shanxi Province</p>
<p>Since last week, our troops and the Japanese forces have engaged in fierce battles on various fronts in Shanxi Province. Japanese troops from Yangqu Haicheng in western Shanxi once attacked Gujiao in three routes, but they were all met with fierce counterattacks by our forces and retreated to Zhengjiazhuang. After repeated attacks by our forces, Dawu has been formally recovered recently, and our forces have taken advantage of the victory to advance towards Lishi, launching fierce attacks on Jinluozhen, Jiaokou, Lijiawan, Lianghui, Hejiata, and other places. Our officers and soldiers are in high spirits and have killed over two hundred Japanese soldiers, occupying Jiaokou, Hejiata, Lijiawan, and other places. Japanese troops in Jiexian, Ershililing, Anyi, Cun, Houwangcun, Zhangdianzhen, and other places have been repeatedly attacked by our forces. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties and are showing signs of collapse. The Japanese troops in Cun have already retreated to Anyi. The Japanese troops entrenched in Jiangxian have suffered heavy casualties and are extremely panicked. They recently destroyed the Yigou Bridge east of the city and constructed fortifications west of the ditch to defend against our attacks. Since our army began surrounding Heilongguan, the Japanese troops have gradually become shaken. Recently, our army launched a brave attack, killing many Japanese soldiers. Heilongguan has been recovered, and the remaining Japanese troops have retreated to Linfen. After occupying Jingrong and Ninghuabao last week, the Japanese troops in northern Shanxi were arrogant. This week, our army launched an active counterattack and achieved significant gains. Jingle and Ninghuabao have been successively recovered. In short, although the Japanese troops in Shanxi Province have repeatedly tried to act recklessly, they have suffered heavy blows. The overall situation is under the control of our large army, and the Japanese attempt to cross the river and attack westward will be extremely difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces</p>
<p>Since last week, our troops and the Japanese forces in northern Jiangsu have engaged in bloody battles in Huaiyin and Baoying. After our army made a strategic shift, we have been actively preparing for a counterattack this week and launched large-scale guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, resulting in significant gains. Xianying County has been formally recovered, and the Japanese troops have fled north. Huaiyin has been surrounded by our forces. Japanese troops from Yangzhou once attacked north of Zhaoguan Dam, attempting to threaten our rear, but our army used skillful tactics to annihilate most of them. Zhaoguan Dam has been captured, and we are now vigorously advancing south, relentlessly pursuing the Japanese. In the Jinan-Quanxiang area of Shandong Province, our troops and the Japanese forces have engaged in fierce battles this week, killing over four hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing many spoils of war. Our army has been particularly active along the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways. The railways have been cut off by our forces from time to time, causing great fear among the Japanese. The people in various counties have formed anti-Japanese self-defense forces and attacked the Japanese everywhere, making it difficult for the Japanese to cope.</p>
<p>Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in northern Zhejiang have been increasing, attempting to clear out our guerrilla forces. Currently, the troops of Japanese officers such as Kumagai, Kikuta, and Koizumi are advancing towards our army in three routes, by land and water, from Huzhou, Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and other places. They have been met with separate counterattacks, resulting in countless Japanese casualties. Koizumi was killed on the spot, shattering the Japanese so-called "mopping-up plan." As for the Pinghu-Haiyan area, the Japanese forces have been entrenched in the city walls, daring not to act rashly. A certain unit of our army, with combat readiness, advanced quickly and launched a surprise attack on Haiyan. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and fled in panic. Haiyan and Shendangyu have been recovered, inflicting a major blow on the Japanese troops in northern Zhejiang. Although Japanese warships frequently appear in the waters of Haimen and Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang, firing shells indiscriminately, in reality, they are merely putting on a show. Our guerrillas have been attacking the Japanese troops in the rear from time to time, capturing spoils of war.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been many small-scale battles between our troops and the Japanese forces in Jiyuan Mutoudian in northern Henan, Taikang in eastern Henan, Taolin in northern Hunan, south of Hukou Pingfeng in northern Jiangxi, and other places, causing heavy losses and threats to the Japanese, making them afraid to act. They are forcibly conscripting able-bodied men everywhere to replenish their ranks, but as a result, the people are resisting to the death, and they have achieved no results.</p>
<h3>Chen Wanliang, a Traitorous Bandit Leader Collaborating with the Japanese in Western Hunan, Executed; Attempted Escape After Capture; Shot Dead While Being Escorted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanling, 16th] The bandit leader Chen Wanliang was a traitor. The Western Hunan Pacification Headquarters dispatched troops to capture the bandit in Baiyang Mountain, which belongs to Suining. During transport, the bandit attempted to escape, and the escorting soldiers shot him dead. The people are rejoicing.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Launches Guerrilla Warfare; Acting Chairman Han Travels Lightly and Directs Military Affairs at the Front</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Northern Jiangsu, 16th] The county and provincial governments are responding to the wartime organization. In addition to leaving a portion of personnel still working in northern Jiangsu, they are supervising officials and civilians in various counties to launch guerrilla warfare. In addition, an administrative office has been established in the rear, managed by Civil Affairs Director Wang Gong and Secretary-General Ma Zhenbang as usual. Acting Chairman Han Deqin is traveling lightly and directing military affairs in the front.</p>

<h3>Public Sports Ground in Southern Shanghai; Landmine Explodes Suddenly; Four Japanese Soldiers Killed and Three Wounded During Morning Exercise; Our Plainclothes Team Attacks Puppet Police</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai news: On the 12th, a platoon of Japanese soldiers was conducting morning exercises at the public sports ground in the southern district of Shanghai when a landmine suddenly exploded, killing four Japanese soldiers and wounding three. That evening, a plainclothes team of over ten people, carrying weapons, surrounded and attacked the patrolling Japanese military police and puppet police. The Japanese military police and puppet police fled in disarray. By the time reinforcements arrived, the plainclothes team had disappeared. Although the search continued until dawn, nothing was found.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Trespass into British Military Zone</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai news: At about 8 PM on the evening of the 14th, seven puppet policemen trespassed into the British military zone. They were discovered by the British military police, who immediately surrounded them. The puppet police fled in all directions.</p>
<h3>Documents on Japanese Use of Poison Gas Obtained Near De'an; Nefarious Deeds Exposed; Efforts Futile</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] In October of last year, our army seized two types of documents on Japanese use of poison gas near De'an. Both documents were issued by the "Central China Expeditionary Army Headquarters" of the Japanese. One was "Examples and Results of Special Weapon Usage in the Xuzhou Campaign and Anqing Operations," printed in July of Showa 13 (1938), and the other was "Usage and Effective Utilization of Special Smoke Tubes and Special Smoke Shells," printed in August of Showa 13 (1938). The former document explains the examples and results of poison gas usage, while the latter explains the methods of usage. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>According to the documents, the Japanese used the following three types of poison gas: First, white simple-packaged gas, used to generate smoke to determine wind direction; Second, green simple-packaged gas, acting as a lacrimatory special poison gas; and third, red simple-packaged suffocation-inducing special poison gas. The first type is non-toxic, while the latter two contain toxic substances.</p>
<p>Regarding the duties when the Japanese use poison gas: 1. Reconnaissance and smoke-releasing plan; 2. Agreement of the first-line commander; 3. Speed of issuing orders; 4. Weather observation; 5. Communication and liaison; 6. Alert and concealment; 7. Transport of supplies; 8. Arrangement of supplies; 9. Ignition; 10. Forest utilization; 11. Disposal after ignition (i.e., transport of gas canisters). Also, the Japanese put on gas masks immediately after releasing the gas and launch a general attack. The gas is only effective in the air for 30 minutes, so gas must be continuously released after the smoke canisters are ignited. A charge must be launched immediately after the poison gas is dispersed to achieve effective gas usage.</p>
<p>The documents also list the battle results achieved using gas. The documents state: "On June 2nd, during the attack on Suixian County, when advancing to the south gate, we could not capture it due to our army's strong defense, so we used poison gas, but without results. We attacked again on June 4th, using gas extensively." "During the siege of Guzhen on May 18th and 19th, which failed, we were subjected to a fierce counterattack by our army. Seeing the situation was critical, the Japanese again released poison gas." "In the Battle of Xiangkou on June 2nd, gas was used." Later, in the Battle of Dangsi Bridge, when our army launched a counterattack, the Japanese were unable to resist and again extensively used gas. In addition, gas was used extensively in various battles on the Shanxi battlefield, such as Jiyuan, Jiangxian, and Wenxi. Each time, our army lost its fighting power and suffered failure due to the Japanese use of gas. Therefore, the Japanese used large amounts of gas whenever they could not win an attack or could not resist our counterattack, but the results were often ineffective. As a result, the Japanese are actively encouraging and training their troops in how to use gas.</p>
<p>The documents also stated the points to be noted when using gas: (1) The various smoke tubes used must be kept secret after use; (2) Smoke tubes and poison gas must not be exposed, but rather thrown into riverbeds or buried underground; (3) Poison gas must not be used in areas inhabited by foreigners; (4) Tests must be conducted indoors, and poisonous smoke must not be allowed to escape; and stated that because improper usage had previously harmed their own soldiers, improvements must be made to prevent problems.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops carry gas masks mainly for protection, but as a cover, they claim they are to guard against our army's use of poison gas. This kind of self-deceiving act is truly pitiful. In short, the Japanese use poison gas to brutally kill our officers and soldiers, but on the other hand, they fear exposing their atrocities and avoiding condemnation from the world, so they try every means to cover up. This shows their efforts are futile.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Hosts Dinner for French Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a dinner for French Ambassador Cosme on the evening of the 16th, inviting Presidents Kong and Sun and Foreign Minister Wang as guests. After the dinner, the ambassador departed.

The guests and host parted happily around 8 PM.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Monopolize Chinese Aviation Industry; Various Countries Deeply Affected; Shipping in North China Already Monopolized; Inland Waterways All Blockaded</h3>
<p>[Shanghai News] Since Japan blockaded the ports along our coast, state-run and private ships have been forced to suspend operations. Japan wants to dominate the aviation industry in China, such as controlling the inland waterway steamships in central China, monopolizing shipping in North China, planning to open routes to Southeast Asia, and refusing to open the Yangtze River and Pearl River. The aviation industries of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China are all affected.</p>
<p>British Aviation Industry Ranked First in China</p>
<p>Britain's aviation power has the largest influence in the aviation industry along the coast and inland waterways of China. For example, in 1936, the number of ships and tonnage entering various ports in China by Britain, Japan, and the United States were: Britain, 48,154 ships, 57,345,515 tons; Japan, 17,911 ships, 24,913,576 tons; United States, 3,973 ships, 3,771,479 tons, which proves that Britain's aviation power in China is more than twice that of Japan. However, after the war began, the situation changed drastically. In 1937, the number of British ships entering and leaving China decreased by 12,831 ships, 21,239,720 tons.</p>
<p>Japan Attempts to Monopolize After the Start of the War</p>
<p>After the war, aviation companies from Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Brazil bought Chinese ships and expanded their aviation businesses in China as much as possible, but Japan attempted to monopolize aviation in China, such as refusing to open the Yangtze River and Pearl River, hindering foreign ships from sailing in Funing, northern Jiangsu, and Haimen, eastern Zhejiang, and unreasonably detaining and inspecting British ships. At the same time, Japan used military force to monopolize shipping in North China. In central China, Japan has already replaced Britain's position. The large and small steamships in the inland waterways of central China are controlled and operated exclusively by Japan. In addition to opening routes from Shanghai to Xiamen, it is also planning to open routes between Shanghai and Southeast Asian ports.</p>
<p>British Aviation Industry Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Since the fall of 1938, Japan's aviation industry in China has seen a sudden rise, and the aviation industries of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China have been extremely affected. For example, last year, the number of Japanese ships entering and leaving various ports in China increased to 5,473 ships, 6,484,620 tons, ranking second. In January of this year, Japan had 478 ships, 759,889 tons, while Britain had 304 ships, 840,302 tons. The number of ships for Britain decreased compared to Japan and the tonnage did not differ much, which proves that Britain's aviation industry in China is gradually declining, while Japan's aviation industry in China is gradually advancing, which is clearly affected by Japan's monopoly on aviation in China.</p>
<p>Dalian Nisshin Actively Expanding</p>
<p>In China's aviation industry, shipping in North China is controlled by the Dalian Steamship Company, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are exclusively sailed by the Nisshin Company, and inland waterways in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are monopolized by the Inland Waterways Steamship Company. In order to expand its aviation business in China, the Nisshin Company has not only illegally confiscated the ships of Chinese merchants but has also built new ships of over 1,000 tons to join the coastal and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River routes. The Japanese military authorities have given it all kinds of conveniences, and the Japanese government has issued operating subsidies. The Shanghai-Yantai line, the Shanghai-Tongzhou line, and the Shanghai-Yangzhou line are all operated by ships sent by the Nisshin Company. The ships of third countries are all prevented. It is also heard that Japan wants to build a modern port near Hong Kong, in which case Hong Kong's shipping will also be in dire straits.</p>
<h3>Auction of Fishing Grounds Held in Vladivostok; Soviet Government's Stance Strong; Japan Helpless Will Issue a Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Tokyo news: The Soviet government auctioned off 293 fishing grounds this afternoon, some of which were previously leased to Japan by the Soviet Union in Vladivostok. At today's Soviet auction of fishing grounds, Japanese fishing industry representatives refused to participate. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita will issue a statement after receiving the official report on the Soviet auction of fishing grounds, explaining Japan's attitude. Arita may report the progress of the Soviet-Japanese fishing negotiations to the Cabinet. Currently, the Japanese fishing industry is maintaining a calm attitude but is fully prepared to protect the fishing rights it has obtained under the treaty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th] After the talks between Japanese Ambassador Togo and Litvinov regarding the fishing issue failed again yesterday, they did not continue negotiations today. It is heard that the Soviet authorities have proceeded with the scheduled auction of various fishing grounds in Vladivostok, but this has not yet been confirmed. Political and Japanese figures here are all extremely calm. Soviet political figures have also said that the current environment is very different from last year, and that all border disputes are not of great significance and will not resort to force, such as the Zhanggufeng Incident.</p>
<p>Speech by Soviet Defense Commissioner</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Defense Commissioner Voroshilov said that fascist aggressors, recently intoxicated by effortless success, are even more thinking about finding new targets to realize their ambitions of aggression. Although the Soviet Union is the most peace-loving country in the world, it is also constantly threatened by aggressors.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor's Report in the House of Commons: Our Country's Foreign Exchange Fund and Explanation of the Fund Committee's Organizational Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon today presented a bill to the House of Commons to balance the Chinese currency system fund. The fund totals £10 million, intended to prevent unnecessary fluctuations in the exchange rate between British and Chinese currencies. HSBC will advance £3 million, Chartered Bank (formerly Mercantile Bank of India, London and China) £2 million, and the remaining £5 million will be the responsibility of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China. The authority to manage the fund's affairs will be vested in a 15-member committee. Two members will be jointly appointed by the Bank of China, and HSBC and Chartered Bank will each appoint one member. The remaining member must be a British expert and will be appointed by the Chinese government with the consent of the British Treasury and the endorsement of British banks. The committee's task is to determine daily policies to prevent unnecessary fluctuations in the exchange rate between British currency and Chinese currency. HSBC and Chartered Bank will receive interest every August, calculated at a rate of 2.75%. If the profit from investments in the London fund account is insufficient to cover the interest, the two Chinese banks will be responsible for clearing the debt, guaranteed by the British Treasury. If the fund is exhausted, the Treasury guarantees the British banks repayment of £5 million. In the event of liquidation in the future, any excess of pounds sterling received by the British banks beyond the original amount advanced, excluding interest, will be returned to the British Treasury. This provision is valid for one year and can be extended for six months upon expiry. British banks can terminate participation by giving seven days' notice, subject to the consent of the Treasury or the Chinese banks.</p>
<h3>Jing-Sha Youth Battlefield Service Corps (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>That Shashi has been able to grow stronger amidst adversity, while possessing objective conditions – that is, the enemy lacks the strength to invade – is due to the appropriate military and administrative measures taken subjectively, especially the newly formed and extremely effective mass service organization, namely the Jing-Sha Border Anti-Japanese Support Association Youth Battlefield Service Corps, which, with its extremely pure patriotic zeal, has diligently achieved many satisfactory results internally, almost occupying a major decisive factor.</p>
<p>Now that various popular movement efforts are being launched, it seems necessary to provide a clear account of the organization, life content, and work achievements of each department of the Corps for others to learn from.</p>
<p>The Corps was established just a few days after the retreat from Wuhan. The people of Shashi were panic-stricken, and the atmosphere was tense. Relying solely on military and police forces to maintain order was no longer feasible. The Anti-Japanese Support Association then planned to organize a Youth Battlefield Service Corps (Shashi had been designated as a war zone), and began recruiting. Many refugee youths enthusiastically signed up, and approximately XX male and female students above the high school level were selected (women accounted for about one-third or more). To meet the needs of the surrounding environment, the plan was to seek training through work. Once reorganized into teams, they immediately began practical service work.</p>
<p>Corps members' compensation: A monthly allowance of ten yuan in national currency covers everything. In addition, the Corps leader, deputy leader, instructor, secretary, general affairs officer, and messenger, one each, and three team leaders, totaling nine people, receive the same treatment as the Corps members and are completely unpaid. However, the meals for these nine officers and soldiers are personally subsidized by the Corps leader. There are also seventeen staff members, whose compensation is also the same as the Corps members. All of the above personnel must regularly work within the camp. They all eat, dress, live, and live together, fully embodying the spirit of equality.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Corps differs from ordinary mass organizations. Ordinary mass organizations must first have some regulations as a standard for organizational work. Due to time constraints, the Corps truly recruited at any time and started working at any time, seeking training in the work and correcting errors in practice. Work methods also varied at any time and any place. In the early days of its establishment, the central task was to stabilize public sentiment. However, during air raids, immediately after the all-clear signal, they would publicize air defense knowledge to the people and methods for eliminating traitors. In short, for every new problem that arose, they would only explain the coping methods to the people and not talk about empty principles.</p>
<p>Key points of the Corps leader's usual instructions to Corps members: First, in terms of spirit, take the nation first and the people first as prerequisites, and take military affairs first and victory first as the goals; unite sincerely under one government and one leader, expel the Japanese pirates, and revive the Chinese nation. Second, in terms of life, ideologize thoughts and politics; militarize actions; scientize work; and artisticize achievements. Promote bottom-up momentum, cultivate the spirit of self-determination, autonomy, and fighting on one's own; lead from top to bottom to prevent thoughts and actions from violating government laws and regulations. In short, revolutionize life.</p>
<p>Organization: The entire headquarters is located in a secluded location. Corps members are divided into three teams according to lifestyle management methods. The first team is for older males, the second team is for younger males, and the third team is for females of all ages. Each team leader is hired from military instructors, and there is also a team assistant who is elected from among the Corps members.</p>
<p>The Corps' work methods are divided into nine groups: 1. Drama, 2. Wall Newspaper, 3. Comics, 4. Lectures, 5. Singing, 6. Comfort, 7. First Aid, 8. Eliminating Traitors, 9. Civilian Connections. Each group has a group leader, who is elected by the Corps members, and there is also an honorary instructor to guide each group's specialized work. Each Corps member can work in several groups concurrently, but must choose one group as their primary work.</p>
<p>Examples of the Corps' work performance include the wall newspaper organization: 1. Self-provided radio; 2. Special telegrams and telephone provided by the Garrison Headquarters – therefore, news is well-informed, earning social praise.</p>
<p>The lecture group has mobilized the entire city's population to carry out traitor elimination work and has uncovered several traitor cases. They have implemented the New Life Movement, promoted cleanliness campaigns, swept away dust, manure, and weeds throughout the city, and cleaned up advertisements posted on various streets and lanes, giving the city a completely new look. They do not use many slogans, only using three or one or two at a time. The meaning strives to be simple, clear, and relevant to the times, and stimulating. The slogans are like this, and the writings are also like this. When rumors were rife, two banks prepared to relocate elsewhere, but the Corps sent people to dissuade them, and they immediately dispelled the idea.</p>
<p>The comfort group, in addition to raising nourishing foods to comfort wounded soldiers, also used vests, cloth shoes, towels, etc. to comfort soldiers doing national defense work.</p>
<p>The first aid group's targets, in addition to rescuing wounded soldiers and refugee children, also provide relief to refugees. A total of more than 2,300 refugees have been registered and evacuated. The strong men are sent to Jiangling (Jingzhou) County to be organized into transport teams, young children are sent to orphanages, the elderly are sent to nursing homes, and those with special skills are sent to the Hubei Association in Chongqing to find work, to increase the vitality of the rear.

<h3>Hitler Arrives in Czech Capital and Issues Annexation Declaration, Dividing Bohemia and Moravia into German Territory, Slovakia Also Becomes a Protectorate</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Czech Capital, 16th) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today delivered a radio address on behalf of Hitler, declaring that Germans in the new protectorate would be naturalized, and that the Nuremberg anti-Jewish laws would be extended to Moravia and Bohemia. The Czech customs system would be linked to Germany.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Czech Capital, 16th) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today broadcast Hitler's declaration, dated March 16, stipulating the organization of Bohemia and Moravia, stating that "Bohemia and Moravia, as part of the German people's living space, have existed for thousands of years. Force and folly caused these two regions to break away from their historical environment and be incorporated into the artificially formed Czech, which has caused a major and continuous unrest. The danger of this unrest increases year by year and may at any time cause a threat to European peace. It has now been proven that Czechoslovakia cannot survive and has collapsed." The declaration also stated that the land formerly belonging to Czech and now occupied by German troops in 1939, is part of Greater Germany and is under German protection, named the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The German residents of the region are German citizens and are under German judicial protection. The protectorate will have autonomous administration and exercise sovereignty within the limits of the protectorate. The German head of state will appoint a German protector to safeguard German interests and abolish any steps that are unfavorable to Germany. Foreign affairs will also be handled by Germany. The protectorate may have a representative in the German government in Berlin. The German government will provide military protection and supervise transportation and telegraph services. If necessary, the German government can seize any administration of the protectorate and establish German power.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Czech, 16th) Official announcement that Moravia and Bohemia are formally incorporated into the German Empire, renamed Ozekia, and the swastika flag is designated as its flag. German troops occupied this area, including the famous Skoda armaments factory.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 16th) German troops are currently entering Slovakia. It is reported that Slovakia will adopt the same political system as Moravia and Bohemia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] After consulting with Hitler, Holtz declared that in order to achieve lasting peace, the fate of the entire Czech nation has been entrusted to Hitler, who has accepted this and has annexed the Czech nation to Germany and will guarantee the Czechs an opportunity for autonomy and development in accordance with their national character.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 15th] Hitler, accompanied by his entourage and guards, crossed the Czech border by car at 4:00 PM today and arrived in Prague at 7:15 PM, staying at Hradčany Palace (i.e., the Czech Presidential Palace).

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Hitler traveled to Prague this afternoon via Bohmisch-Leipa (in Bohemia), accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, General Keitel, General Stumpfnagel, and Secret Police Chief Himmler, as well as many senior generals and party officials. Former Sudeten Party leader Henlein has been appointed Czech Civil Administrator, while Berkel has been appointed Moravian Civil Administrator. According to reports from the Slovak capital, the Little Russian Assault Troops have disarmed most Czech troops. The German troops entering Slovakia have been confirmed. The troops entering Moravia and Bohemia encountered heavy snow, and visibility was limited to ten yards, making it extremely difficult for mechanized units to advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Prague, 15th] German mechanized units entered the city this morning, and an hour later, German infantry also arrived. All government buildings, such as the Ministry of Defense, were immediately occupied. Germans shouted "Heil Hitler," while Czechs sang the Czech national anthem.

Also, the Czech cabinet has resigned.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Hitler has authorized General Blaskowitz to handle matters in Bohemia and Moravia on an interim basis.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th] After Germany occupied Czech, its territory has increased by two provinces of extremely wealthy land. Bohemia and Moravia are Czech territory. Although they may still retain a considerable degree of autonomy, they will become German people, and the two provinces will become German provinces. As a result, Germany's population has increased by seven million people, and it can also easily obtain the agricultural products of the two provinces. After this, Germany will carry out five things in the occupied territories: (1) Unify the currency and customs duties of Bohemia and Moravia, (2) Extend Goering's Four-Year Plan to the two new provinces, (3) Take over all gold reserves of the Czech National Bank, (4) After disbanding the rebellious troops, the defense of Bohemia and Moravia will be the responsibility of the German army, (5) Implement anti-Jewish regulations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] German Freick is flying to Prague today to "clarify international legal issues regarding Bohemia and Moravia."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Germany's first official comment on today's events appeared in the Foreign Office's News Agency, stating that "History has never given Czech any independent demands.

<p>German Troops Continue to Advance Towards Slovakia</p>
<p>[Reuters, Czech Capital, 16th] It is reported that several German troops, in conjunction with the Linke Guard, have invaded Slovakia to "protect the Slovak people."

<h3>Ruthenia Declares Independence, Appoints Volosin as President, Resists Aggression and Inflicts Heavy Losses on Hungarian Troops</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Bratislava, 15th) The Ruthenian Parliament has formally declared Ruthenia completely independent and decided to resist the Hungarian invasion.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Hust, 16th) After the Ruthenian Parliament declared independence, it has reorganized the new government and appointed Volosin as President. The new government has contacted various foreign countries seeking recognition.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Prague, 15th) After the establishment of the new Ruthenian cabinet, Prime Minister Volosin telegraphed the Polish authorities for cooperation, but Poland did not respond.</p>
<p>Ruthenia Orders Mobilization</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Bratislava, 16th) Fierce fighting has taken place in the border areas between Ruthenia and Hungary. Hungarian troops invaded and occupied 18 towns in the morning, but they have now been expelled by Ruthenian national defense forces. At the same time, the railway between the Ruthenian capital and the Hungarian capital has also been destroyed, preventing the Hungarian army from transporting troops. The war extended into the afternoon, and the national army was unable to withstand it and gradually retreated out of the territory. The attack by the Hungarian army on the village of Silisi was also repelled with heavy losses. It is reported that the young people of Ruthenia are rushing to the front lines to defend the country. Slovak soldiers residing in Ruthenia have also joined the army to serve. President Volosin has ordered a general mobilization, and all men in the country will be enlisted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] The Ruthenian National Defense Force is now doing its best to resist the Hungarian invasion. Volunteers and civilians in various places are grabbing various objects as weapons to fight for the independence of the country. Because the Czech army does not allow the supply of military supplies and is obstructing it, there are many difficulties in the war. It is claimed that the Hungarian army has occupied four towns and is now attacking the fifth town.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 16th] The Hungarian army was originally scheduled to arrive at the Polish border yesterday, but due to the fierce resistance of the Ruthenian army along the way, it failed to arrive as scheduled, but it is believed that it can arrive today.</p>
<p>Hungary Does Not Allow Cessation of Aggression</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 16th] Two platoons of Czech troops in Ruthenia were forced to retreat to Polish territory due to the Hungarian invasion. They were disarmed and taken in by Polish troops.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 15th] Ruthenia's reply to Hungary's ultimatum was delivered here last night. The reply stated that Ruthenia has sent three representatives to Hungary as quickly as possible to request the Hungarian government to immediately order a halt to military operations. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky replied that if the Ruthenian representatives come to Hungary, the Hungarian government will entertain them with the courtesy of a distinguished guest, but it is impossible to stop military action. At the same time, Csaky asked Volosin to do his best to avoid bloodshed.</p>
<p>Romania Takes Military Measures</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Czech Capital, 16th) Hitler and his troops are now advancing eastward. The Czech Republic no longer exists. Hungarian troops are advancing without encountering resistance from Czech and Ruthenian troops, reaching the Polish border, so a common Polish-Hungarian border has been established. It is rumored that Romania is now reinforcing its border garrison, and Yugoslavia has also decided to take necessary military measures on its northern border facing Hungary.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 15th] This denies that Romanian troops have invaded the Ruthenian border.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 16th] Hungarian patrols arrived in heavy snow in Warsaw today and were welcomed by Polish sentries, so the common border sought by Poland and Hungary has become a reality. The Hungarian army said that the snow in the Carpathian Mountains was waist-deep, and it was a mistake to arrive at the expected time. More Hungarian troops will arrive at the border today. When the Hungarian patrols appeared in the heavy snow, the waiting Poles gave them a warm cheer.</p>
<p>Polish Troops Enter Slovakia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th] According to German official explanation, this time Czech exercised the right of self-determination to request Germany to place it under protection. As for the Vienna Arbitration (the arbitration by Italy and Germany to delineate the Hungarian-Czech border), it should be abolished due to the recent development of the situation, so if Little Russia is incorporated into Hungary, Germany will no longer express opposition as in the past.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Slovak Capital, 15th] Hungarian troops have occupied the gold mines of Little Russia. Hungarians and Slovaks clashed in Slovakia yesterday, with slight casualties. Hungarian guerrillas have invaded Slovakia. Tiso has mobilized members of the Linka Vanguard to resist Hungarian aggression.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Slovak Capital, 15th] Polish troops have entered the Bratislava City Hall in northern Slovakia.</p>
<h3>Terrifying Czech, Fearing Nazi Retaliation, Many Jews Commit Suicide</h3>

<h3>Anglo-French Naval Cooperation, General Staff Continues Negotiations, US Defense Plan Expected to Pass</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Naval Secretary Shakespeare replied to questions in the House of Commons today, saying that future Anglo-French alliances in wartime would be based on the completion of naval cooperation. Negotiations between the naval general staffs of the two countries are still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Minister for the Coordination of Defence, Chatterfield, gave a powerful explanation of Chamberlain's recent statement at the House of Lords Defence debate today, that the so-called defence policy does not refer to Britain's will and method of counter-attacking when invaded, saying that military developments in recent years have reduced the power of offensive. The country's existing bombers can be called one of the best in the world. At the same time, the government is determined to enrich both combat and counter-attack capabilities. In short, if war breaks out in the future, the people of the country can trust its air force as before.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The current situation in Czech should prompt all parties to quickly pass the government's defence plan. Although this is not an official comment, it is the first reaction of the United States to the Czech incident.</p>
<h3>Eden's Stirring Speech Suggests Forming a Coalition Government and Making a Great Decision Quickly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech on the Czech situation at the House of Commons meeting last night, Eden followed with a speech, standing up amidst enthusiastic cheers, saying that the nature of Germany's actions is now beyond doubt. To his knowledge, there is no evidence of any mistreatment of the German minority in Czech, and Germany has not followed the provisions of the Munich Agreement that should be notified to the Czech or British and French governments if any serious or urgent events occur. He believes that Germany's excuse is simply absurd, even if the excuse is true, Germany's actions are still not justified. Eden asked whether there were still members who thought that after the Czech incident, we should still be patient and wait for Germany to make threatening demands on other weaker countries, and that the country is now facing a situation of rapid decline in its international status. Eden then issued a warning, saying, "I firmly believe that if the current method is not stopped and allowed to develop, the world will fall into chaos and complete tragedy, and our country will not be spared." Eden suggested forming a coalition government of all parties. He said that the result of the establishment of a coalition government would be to concentrate the strength of the largest democracy in Europe to an unprecedented extent. He believed that nothing could be more important and beneficial than this. Eden continued, "We must examine the military strength and strategic strongholds of Europe, and consult with those who share our views, regardless of their country or who they are. At this point, we must decide our policy and where we are determined to act. Then, we must quickly decide on a military plan to promote the completion of our policy." Finally, Eden especially pointed out in conclusion, "A great country should sometimes make great decisions. I believe now is the time. I truly believe that only by making this decision can our people be freed from the constant threats and terrors of the present era."</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Condemn Germany for Endangering Peace: Destroying Agreements and Forcibly Occupying Czech Territory, Which is Bound to Cause a Chaotic Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, when attending the House of Commons tonight, made a statement on the Czech incident, stating briefly that the British government's recent efforts to solicit joint guarantees from the countries of the Munich Conference for the new Czech territory have already failed. The British government has no separate guarantee responsibility. After briefly explaining the Czech loan and the postponement of Hudson and Stanley's visit to Germany, (the Foreign Secretary once mentioned this in the House of Lords), he declared that he deeply believed that the Munich Conference was appropriate and believed that the world also felt this way. Regarding Germany's current actions, he absolutely did not believe that the other countries of the Munich Conference were involved. The Munich Agreement was established as a solution to the dispute. Subsequent changes to the original agreement's actions and methods are absolutely inconsistent with the Munich Agreement. Germany's occupation of territories unrelated to its nation by force is the first time. This incident will inevitably cause a chaotic international situation, and its result will be a severe blow to the belief in peace. It is most regrettable that the world's belief in peace is gradually recovering, and tangible steps are expected to lead to practical benefits, but such a bad incident has occurred. The Prime Minister then reiterated his recent speech, saying that to this day, other countries should also contribute to the progress of peace together with the countries concerned. Chamberlain said sadly, "Therefore, I cannot help but feel sorry for this incident, but we must not let this shake our progress. We must know that the wishes of all mankind are still focused on restoring peace, understanding, and harmony. Therefore, our country's goal today is the same as before, to resolve disputes by negotiation instead of force, to realize the desire for peace, although we must be prepared to encounter difficulties and disappointments at any time, but the goal I hold is of great importance to human happiness."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The Foreign Secretary declared to the House of Commons that although the Czech government has agreed to the incident that occurred in the Czech Republic, I have to admit that it violates the spirit of the Munich Agreement.</p>
<h3>Labor Party Member Glenfield's Speech: Can Munich's Promise Still Be Called Faithful?</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Labor Party Member Glenfield declared in the House of Commons today, "Today is a time when Britain should feel ashamed. We have disregarded the truth and allowed violence to replace public reason and justice. Mr. Chamberlain believes that the promises of Munich are faithful, and the head has already said so. Czechoslovakia has now been occupied, and there is no difference from being occupied without the Munich Agreement. We are not only not entering an era of peace and security in Europe, but are moving towards a period of serious danger. Those who will immediately suffer military disadvantages tomorrow may be Poland, Hungary can be overthrown in a matter of hours, and Romania will also be invaded." Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that what was previously announced was not the independence of Slovakia, but the subordination of Slovakia to Germany.</p>
<h3>It is rumored that Memel wants to join Germany. The future fate of Danzig is also rumored.</h3>
<p>[Paris, 16th] According to foreign news, the Berlin branch of Havas reported that it is rumored in Berlin that the German residents of the Memel region and the Free City of Danzig in Lithuania, encouraged by the situation in the Czech Republic, will soon request Hitler to incorporate the two places into German territory.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Memel, 15th] According to general observations here, the 150,000 residents of the Memel Autonomous Region will soon declare their desire to be incorporated into Germany. Dr. Neumann, the leader of the German people here, declared that forcing Memel to separate from Germany is a far cry from national self-subordination. He said that he has led 87% of the residents and is about to take the necessary steps to change the national system.</p>

<p>According to the Associated Press report from Prague on the 16th, Hitler, the demon king of the German invaders, arrived in Prague on the 15th in the wind and snow. On the 16th, he led a "celebratory parade." The current situation in the Czech Republic is:</p>
<p>(1) The Slovak region declared "independence", but in reality, it has become a vassal state of Germany, and everything is controlled by the German invaders.</p>
<p>(2) The Ruthenia region was annexed by Hungary. However, the Hungarian and German armies are already in confrontation. Because after Hungary annexed Ruthenia, it bordered Poland, which may form a direct conflict to stop Germany. This naturally reveals the contradictions between Italy and Germany, and the disputes are still evolving.</p>
<p>(3) The two remaining wealthy provinces of the Czech Republic, Bohemia and Moravia, have actually become provinces of Germany, and seven million people have become slaves of the country. Hitler's methods of disposal are: 1. The financial and tariff systems of the two provinces of Bohemia are combined with Germany; 2. Germany takes over all the reserves of the Czech National Bank; 3. Dissolve the Czech army, and Germany operates all national defense affairs; 4. Implement the Nuremberg Jewish Law in both.</p>
<p>Here, we hope that the compatriots who have mistakenly heard the arguments of "anti-communism", "peace", "compromise", and "international mediation" will wipe their eyes and see the tragedy of the Czech Republic's subjugation under the policies of "anti-communism", "peace", "midway compromise", and "international mediation"!</p>
<p>British Noise and Cheers</p>
<p>The fall of Czechoslovakia is clear evidence that the German aggressors have shattered the Munich Agreement and the failure of the Anglo-French compromise policy. Prime Minister Chamberlain of England also had to admit this point in his report to the House of Commons on the evening of the 15th, saying: "I never believed that the countries that signed the Munich Agreement could have foreseen what Germany is doing today." In fact, the recent vigorous anti-XXX movement promoted by the people of Britain and France is evidence of "prediction", but unfortunately, Mr. Zhang is unwilling to see and say it! In addition to "expressing extreme regret," Mr. Zhang still encouraged his people to "not act rashly." We should know the pain of his intention and situation—the noise of opposition party members can be said to be a reflection of public opinion. As Labor Party member Telanfield said, "We are now truly moving towards an era of peace and stability. The crisis is imminent. Today, the Czech Republic can be destroyed, and Poland will be destroyed tomorrow, and then Hungary and Romania. What can the outcome be?" Does Chamberlain not know this? Mr. Zhang finally announced that he had appointed Overseas Trade Minister Hessen to pay a return visit to Warsaw, Moscow, and Helsinki, Finland. The crowd cheered when they heard this. We can assert that the sound of British abuse and cheers is the sound of the entire British and even the world's righteous and peaceful people. If the Chamberlain government does not want to lead to a reversal, it should first know what to choose in this sound of abuse and cheers.</p>
<p>Warning from the Chief of the Soviet Red Army</p>
<p>A dispatch from Moscow on the 15th stated that the Soviet People's Commissar for National Defense, Voroshilov, for the Red Army's military preparation, denounced the rumors about the weakening of morale and disintegration of the Red Army to foreign reporters. Mr. Fu declared loudly: "The fascist army that recently invaded Lake Hassan (referring to the Japanese army's invasion of Zhanggufeng) was also misled by this kind of rumor. At that time, they thought that the opportunity could not be missed and could not wait, so they invited frustration. The result of Lake Hassan has become common knowledge. If the fascists still think it is not enough and want to receive a greater lesson, then the Soviet army has been waiting for a long time, why not try it!" The Associated Press also reported on the 16th that Fu also reported at the Communist Party Congress on the 15th that since 1934, the Soviet military strength has doubled, and all officers and soldiers have received strict training, cultivated internationalist spirit, and have been prepared to complete it, and can give aggressors a painful blow at any time. This is a major warning not only to Hitler, who is marching eastward, but also to Japan, which is clamoring for a challenge. We also want to warn those who are stubborn and willingly promote XXX, under the manifestation of the Soviet Union's strength development and anti-aggression declarations, you should quickly clean up all malicious criticisms and stop making fools of yourselves in front of the broad masses!</p>
<h3>European Outlook: Will Germany Reach Out to Eastern Europe Again? Will Italy Create Disaster in the Mediterranean? Britain Attaches Great Importance to the Czech Incident and is Working Hard to Complete the Expansion of Military Procedures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The Czech incident is the focus of today's British Cabinet meeting. Everyone attaches great importance to this issue and is working hard to complete the military expansion procedures. Although British policy still aims to resolve disputes peacefully, it must be prepared for Germany to take further action outside its borders. Today's developments have greatly surprised all parties, but all believe that under these circumstances, it is difficult for Britain to implement any effective action. Former Foreign Secretary Eden's proposal to form a coalition government of all parties has very few supporters. According to the observations of diplomatic observers, the disintegration of the Czech Republic was faster than expected, but Hitler's swift and rapid occupation of Bohemia and Moravia was not enough to surprise anyone. The method used by Germany this time is no different from the successful method it has used to expand outward once or twice in the past twelve months, that is, it is fully prepared, and once the preparation is completed, the incident will break out, and the German army will only complete the occupation diplomacy and what it has gained above. However, what the German army has gained this time is not flowers and cheers, but jeers. It is said that the two provinces of the Czech Republic are fat meat, and Germany may find it difficult to swallow, but Germany's strong digestion ability has been revealed before. Whether Hungary's forceful seizure of Little Russia had Germany's prior consent is not known. Generally, Germany will not pay much attention to this, because Hungary itself does not have much strength to resist Germany's eastward advance. Poland and Italy expressed satisfaction with Hungary's move, but the Netherlands was very annoyed by the changes in the Slovak situation. Diplomatic observers are now watching the second major change in the world: Germany has something to do with Eastern Europe, or Italy is creating disaster in the Mediterranean. According to general observations, Germany once promised Italy full assistance when it annexed other groups in the past, but on this slim basis, Italy can hardly have excessive hope. At the same time, according to news from France, the French ambassador to Germany has formally inquired about the true meaning of Hitler's declaration and the Czech incident. French Foreign Minister Bonnet spoke with the Polish ambassador and the ambassadors to Britain and France this morning. In the evening, the French Foreign Minister received the German ambassador. At that time, he will convey to the French Foreign Minister that Germany's actions regarding the Czech Republic were all agreed to by the Czech government. The sudden turn of events in the Czech incident has made the impression in the French capital extremely deep, but what makes the French the most uneasy is Hitler's declaration that the Czech Republic is Germany's lifeline and that it has belonged to Germany for thousands of years. This declaration clearly abandons the principle of national appeal in the book "Mein Kampf" and Hitler's declaration after the Munich Conference, saying that the German National Socialist Party does not allow non-Germans to participate in advocacy in Germany.</p>
<p>National Review</p>
<p>British</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th] This morning, all newspapers had extremely detailed discussions on the meeting between Hitler and Czech President Hacha. The diplomatic correspondents of the newspapers and the German visitor of The Times all said that during the meeting, Hitler said that if the Czech side did not accept Germany's demands, he would send planes to Prague for bombing immediately.</p>
<p>American</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] "The New York Times" said today, "Hitler has shattered the only army that can resist his plans between Berlin and the Danube. He has stretched out the hand of a robber and added it to gold, which is what he urgently wants to hear. He has given a lesson to the small countries of Central Europe and has shown the world the value of Nazi promises and Germany's true purpose."</p>
<p>Soviet</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] The Truth Newspaper published an article commenting on the Czech incident, saying that "Czechoslovakia's complete submission has made Germany's threat to Poland and Romania even greater, and there is a possibility of new friction and conflict in Central Europe." The newspaper also said that Germany has again shown its inferiority of not keeping promises, and this is the result of the weak diplomacy of Britain and France.</p>
<p>Italian</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 5th] The official kept silent about the recent changes in Europe. The newspapers here roughly published general opinions. The "Telegraph" reported that the Munich Conference was convened in September last year to stop the entire Czech war. Munich may have a great influence on the situation, but its spirit has now been lost.</p>
<p>Japanese</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] The newspapers here explained Germany's actions as another step in the eastward advance. The "Asahi Shimbun" said, "Stalin said in his speech at the Communist Party Congress that Germany has changed its plan to advance eastward and turned westward. This is a big mistake. Poland and Romania will be the most threatened in the future."</p>
<p>German</p>
<p>[Reuters, Palind, 16th] Today, all newspapers here believe that abandoning the principle of national self-determination is a legitimate move, saying that in view of the long history, Czechoslovakia can only prosper under Germany's jurisdiction. The "People's Inspection Newspaper" welcomed this matter, saying that "Chamberlain has participated in aimless demonstrations to Germany despite the pressure from the opposition."</p>

<h3>The Famine in Guangdong is Severe: Hong Kong Township Associations are Discussing Relief: The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Asks a Central Committee Member to Fly to Chongqing to Appeal for Tax Exemption on Foreign Rice: Township Associations Will Jointly Organize Fundraising to Purchase Rice and Operate Price Controls</h3>
<p>Since the smoke of war has spread in Guangdong, traffic has been blocked, and the import of foreign rice has completely stopped. Moreover, unscrupulous merchants are seeking profits, ignoring the livelihood of tens of millions of people in the interior, and massively collecting and exporting grain and rice in an attempt to make huge profits. As a result, rice shortages have formed successively in the four counties of Chaozhou, Shantou, Nanhai, Panyu, Zhongshan, and Shunde, and the situation is becoming increasingly severe. If considerable relief cannot be obtained in a short period of time, tens of millions of people in the above-mentioned counties will be reduced to starving corpses, which is beyond remedy. Therefore, township chambers of commerce in Hong Kong have individually sprung up in recent days and are actively planning relief for their hometowns. On the one hand, they urgently telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Central Government and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to take practical relief measures as soon as possible and to allow the exemption of import taxes on foreign rice as a temporary measure of relief, so as to quickly purchase a large amount of foreign rice to be transported to the interior and carry out large-scale price controls, so as to curb the spread of the rice famine and save tens of millions of people in various counties in the interior from dire straits. However, yesterday, the Chaozhou and Shantou Chamber of Commerce first obtained a reply from Chairman Chiang, stating that in order to maintain foreign exchange relations, the request for exemption of import taxes on foreign rice was not approved, and it was still advisable to purchase domestic rice from neighboring provinces. Yesterday, the Zhongshan and other chambers of commerce and clan associations in Hong Kong stated that although the Chaozhou and Shantou Chamber of Commerce had received a reply, the exemption of foreign rice from import taxes was not approved, but the rice famine in the interior was becoming increasingly severe, and the people's food was worrying, and relief could not be delayed.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Representative Flies to Chongqing</p>
<p>Therefore, the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce is still not negligent in its affairs. According to the previous decision, it is rapidly raising huge sums of money to purchase and transport foreign rice back to the interior for price controls, stepping up the promotion, hoping to achieve results. On the other hand, it is still appealing to the central government to ask for urgent action and temporarily exempt a considerable amount of foreign rice from import taxes, so that various effective relief plans can be implemented in the short term. In order to achieve this goal, yesterday, it specially requested a certain central committee member from the county to personally write a poor letter and immediately take a flight to Chongqing to meet with Chairman Chiang and Finance Minister Kong and various Cantonese politicians of the central government, asking them to understand the difficulties of the people and prevent tens of millions of people in Guangdong from falling into desperation, examine the urgent needs of the situation, and allow one million ancestral rice to be imported duty-free in order to save the people of Zhongshan County from hunger.</p>
<p>Preparing to Raise Funds to Transport Rice to Macau</p>
<p>According to what the reporter learned from Guo Quan of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, after deciding to raise funds to purchase foreign rice and transport it back to the county for price controls, the process of raising funds has developed rapidly. As of yesterday, a considerable number of funds have been raised, and those who have generously contributed are still coming. It is expected that after a few more days, a considerable amount of funds can be obtained, which is not much different from the originally planned amount. Because Chairman Chiang replied to the Chaozhou and Shantou Chamber of Commerce, refusing to exempt foreign rice from import requests, the Chamber of Commerce immediately sent representatives to Beijing to personally visit the authorities and appeal in order to take quick action and relieve the suffering of the people in their hometowns. At present, the only hope is that the representatives will have a satisfactory result in this trip, and that the authorities will allow them to identify foreign rice and return it to the county for price controls duty-free. Once a definite telegram from the representatives is received, they will begin to purchase a large amount of foreign rice in Hong Kong and transport it to Macau, and then transport it back to various towns and markets in Zhongshan County for price controls.</p>
<p>Township Chambers of Commerce Jointly Provide Relief</p>
<p>According to a reliable investigation by our reporter yesterday, people in the Siyi, Panyu, and Shunde overseas Chinese communities stated that the rice famine in the counties was equally serious. If the overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong take individual actions and launch relief efforts in their own counties, they will feel that they will be greatly hindered in appealing to the central government and all other activities. It is necessary to take joint and consistent action. Therefore, it is proposed that the overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong and China jointly unite to organize a general relief organization for the rice famine in the interior to be responsible for promoting everything. On the one hand, they will follow the example of the heads of the rice famine county governments and contact the central government for an appeal. The overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong will jointly send a telegram to the central government, even if they are not allowed to import an unlimited amount of foreign rice duty-free. , please also weigh the pros and cons and allow each county to stipulate a certain amount under the principle of not harming our internal and external financial institutions, such as the previous method of registering foreign rice for duty-free import. If this wish is achieved, the funds jointly raised by the overseas Chinese communities will be used to purchase rice stones, and a fair distribution will be made according to the rice panic situation and import figures in each county, and they will be transported back for price controls. It is believed that such action will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Yesterday, the overseas Chinese leaders of Siyi, etc., contacted their respective related overseas Chinese communities, and it is expected that this will become a reality during the day.</p>
<p>Xinhui Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Finance Minister Kong</p>
<p>The rice famine in Siyi is most severe in Taishan and Xinhui. The people of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong are concerned about their hometowns. Yesterday, they specially convened a meeting to discuss relief measures. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance asking for exemption from foreign rice tax, and at the same time sent a letter to the magistrate of Xinhui County, asking him to cooperate with various groups to organize price controls. The letter and telegram said: Kong Minister of Finance of the National Government of Chongqing, Xinhui County is now in a period of green and yellow shortage, and the price of grain and rice is soaring. In addition, someone is searching for exports within the territory, which further promotes the lack of people's hunger, which will lead to starvation. I implore you to save the lives of the people immediately, temporarily exempt the import tax on foreign rice, and prohibit the export of rice to avoid the rice famine and maintain the people's food supply. I can't help but feel grateful. President Qu Zesen of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Zhang Lanzhou Qian Kou,</p>
<p>Heshan Chamber of Commerce Allocates Funds for Price Controls</p>
<p>The Heshan Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong held a meeting at 8:30 last night to discuss the matter of remitting funds back to the county to organize price controls. Deng Yutang reported that the current price of rice in Shaping Market is 30 yuan per unit, and each yuan of note can only buy about nine catties of rice. If price controls are not implemented quickly and grain and rice are not transported to provide relief, the villagers will have to eat grass roots to satisfy their hunger one day. It was unanimously decided to determine the national currency of 10,000 yuan and hand it over to the county magistrate for management, organizing price controls, and allocating a large amount of funds to purchase tens of thousands of dan of grain stored in Macau by the South China Rice Industry Company, trying to transport it to the county for storage as soon as possible, so as to put forward price controls when the rice famine is more serious. Then discuss the matter of allocating 2,000 yuan for the Shui Kou Township. When Wu Chaoming and the head of the township reported that the township was currently at the forefront of the shops, the disaster was severe. It was decided that the head of the township should first report the situation in the township in detail in writing, so as to forward it to the county government for verification, and then allocate funds from the remittance of 10,000 yuan for assistance.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Luo Fuguo Gave a Speech in Guangzhou Yesterday to Raise Funds for the YWCA: Luo Xuhe Gave the Same Broadcast</h3>
<p>The fundraising campaign of the Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association has begun. The fundraising period is from the 10th to the 31st of this month. The goal is 16,000 yuan, and we must strive to get the amount during the fundraising period, so that all activities of the association can continue. The wife of Sir Luo Fuguo, the governor of Hong Kong, believes that the association is well-organized and has made outstanding achievements. In order to support the association's fundraising campaign, she specially made a broadcast speech at 6:03 last night, appealing to all sectors of Hong Kong for the association and requesting support. Also, the first Chinese representative, Sir Luo Xuhe, said that the association's past work has greatly benefited society and mankind in seeking happiness. He also broadcast a speech on the broadcasting station at 6:47 last night, asking all sectors to work hard to donate and jointly participate in the charity event.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong University's Cooperation with Us: Hang Liwu Will Make Important Suggestions: The Meeting Agenda is Scheduled to Begin Next Week: Hang Rescheduled to Fly from Chongqing to Hong Kong and Arrive on the 20th</h3>
<p>The newly organized committee of the University of Hong Kong plans to prepare for the important matter of the university's practical cooperation with various universities in our country. Mr. Hang Liwu, a famous educator and current director of the Central Gengkuan Association, has been hired as a member of the committee. Mr. Hang was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Chongqing today, but due to delays, he has postponed his departure. According to sources, Mr. Hang has rescheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 20th of this month. The committee has a total of 13 members and one secretary. Chinese members account for three people, and Mr. Hang is one of them. The purpose of the meeting is to communicate Chinese and British culture, so Mr. Hang will make great contributions with his many years of experience in Chinese education and culture. The committee will convene a meeting immediately after Mr. Hang arrives in Hong Kong. In the future, the meeting will be held continuously until several or ten weeks. The official meeting period will begin next week. Mr. Hang's visit here clearly carries important suggestions from the central authorities. The committee convened its first meeting at the 21st year of the year before yesterday (the 14th), but because Mr. Hang failed to attend in time, it first scheduled the agenda. Regarding the promotion of Sino-British cultural relations, the following points are generally part of the attention issues: (1) Reorganize and expand engineering, so as to cultivate the engineering talents urgently needed in our country; (2) Exchange or mutually assign students, such as Hong Kong The University itself has complete medical facilities, and most of the Western doctors in Hong Kong graduated from the school. In the future, if students from domestic universities who study medicine think it is necessary, they can be transferred to study at the University of Hong Kong; (3) Exchange professors; (4) Set up free scholarships; (5) Allocate a part of the British Boxer Indemnity to subsidize the University of Hong Kong and enhance its educational function.</p>
<h3>Alarming Number of Tuberculosis Cases! Over a Thousand Cases in Seven Weeks, Averaging 21 Cases Per Day</h3>
<p>Recently, Hong Kong health authorities, in order to clearly understand the exact number of tuberculosis cases, specifically announced that tuberculosis is a disease that should be reported to the government. Only seven weeks have passed since this measure was implemented, and according to information gathered by reporters, in these seven weeks, up to the evening before last, 1,080 cases of tuberculosis have occurred in Hong Kong, averaging 150 cases per week and 21 cases per day. The numbers are indeed alarming. Upon investigation, Hong Kong has a dense population, and many ignorant people spit everywhere, which can be a medium for transmission. Currently, Hong Kong lacks sufficient tuberculosis hospitals. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will pay close attention to this issue.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Refugees Completed in the New Territories and Sha Tau Kok Area; Huizhou Merchants Association Sends Refugees to Kailong Mountain to Reclaim Wasteland; Refugee Camps in Hong Kong and Kowloon Increase to Over Ten Thousand People</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of Dongjiang (East River), Huiyang, Luo, and other places, the refugees stranded in the New Territories have returned to the mainland one after another. The organizations responsible for rescuing refugees are actively finding ways to provide funds and evacuate them. The refugees who fled to the New Territories a month ago were mostly from Huiyang, Dongguan, and Bao'an, scattered in Tai Po, Sha Tau Kok, and other places. Except for the refugees in various parts of the New Territories, who were completely evacuated two months ago, there were still several hundred refugees in the Chinese area of Sha Tau Kok until recently, who have now also been completely repatriated. The refugees there were managed by the Pinggang Huiyang Merchants Association. The refugee evacuation office of the association issued appropriate travel expenses and food allowances based on the refugees' return journey, so as to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold. As for some refugees who lost their families and had no place to return to, they were completely moved to Kailong Mountain in Huiyang County to reclaim wasteland. This plan was decided before the start of refugee evacuation and has now been implemented and is progressing smoothly. The land in Kailong Mountain is fertile and very suitable for planting and production. Therefore, it is hoped that the refugees who are resettled there will have a good harvest in the future. In addition, there are also refugees who returned to their hometowns via the Bao'an border, stranded in Dapeng, the fifth district of Bao'an, and unable to return to their hometowns. There are still several hundred people. The authorities dispatched personnel yesterday to investigate the actual situation in order to carry out resettlement and relief. According to an official Hong Kong investigation report, on the 11th of this month, the number of people in each refugee camp increased by 300 compared to the figure from last week (4th). Specifically, 1,444 people in the UK camp, 993 in Ma Tau Chung, 1,608 in North Point, 2,840 in Kam Tin, 813 in Fanling (North), 1,021 in Fanling (South), 659 in Gilruth, 1,116 in Man Kam To, 35 in the Chinese, Lai Chi Kok Hospital, and 767 in Ma Tau Chung, totaling 11,296 people.</p>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the Hong Kong Shanghai University Alumni Association has always paid close attention to social undertakings and encouraged its members to participate in various social organizations and devote themselves to social work. For example, in last year's performance of "The West Chamber" by the Chinese Women's Association, most of the actors were Shanghai University alumni. This year, the association's members also participated in the New York Miss event of the Chinese Youth Ambulance Corps, which was highly praised by society. There are also many members of the association who preside over various charitable organizations and social service agencies in Hong Kong. It is reported that the association, in view of the increasing number of compatriots coming to Hong Kong to take refuge, some of whom came to Hong Kong hastily due to sudden changes, resulting in</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Alumni Association Holds Dinner Dance to Raise Funds for Relief; Tomorrow Night at Kowloon Tong Garden Club</h3>
<p>Those who have no clothes and no food are in urgent need of relief. Therefore, a large-scale dinner dance was launched to raise huge sums for the relief of compatriots and the nurturing of refugee children. The dinner dance is now scheduled to be held on the evening of the 18th of this month (Saturday) at 8:30 PM at the Kowloon Tong Garden Club. The ticket price is two dollars, and there will be a midnight meal. No additional donations will be solicited inside the venue. There will also be various dance performances and entertainment. Those who wish to participate can purchase tickets from Mr. Yuen Wai-yang (phone 20304) and Mr. Wong Shou-fa (phone 31273). Tickets are also sold at the entrance of the club. Those who have already purchased tickets are requested to quickly reserve seats at the Kowloon Tong Garden Club (phone 59427). It is said that there are not many dinner dance tickets left. It is hoped that those in Hong Kong who are dedicated to charitable causes will purchase them as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h3>Shenzhen Refugee Camp; Nine Enemy Planes Bombed Shenzhen Again Yesterday; Suddenly Caught Fire Last Night; Most of It Was Destroyed, and the Yousheng Hotel Was Also Affected; More Than a Thousand Refugees Have No Place to Go, and Their Cries Shake the Heavens</h3>
<p>The Yousheng Company in Shenzhen, which used to be run by the Free Federation, was built into a refugee camp and all the refugees from various stations in the New Territories were moved there. It was only in the process of making various efforts in construction that on the 21st of last month, enemy planes suddenly flew over the area and dropped bombs, and the refugee camp plan was shattered. Subsequently, the authorities ordered the Free Federation to transfer the refugee relief work that was originally handled to the Sino-Western Emergency Refugee Association to continue its measures. Therefore, the refugees who had temporarily moved to Fanling and other places to avoid relief were all returned to Shenzhen. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 PM last night, the Sheung Shui Police Station suddenly received a telegram from Shenzhen, stating that the refugee camp in Shenzhen had suddenly caught fire. The fire was so bright that it lit up the sky, and in an instant, a large part of the refugee camp was burned down, and there was a danger of affecting the Shenzhen Hotel. Unfortunately, because the area is not under British jurisdiction, although the police station received this news, it was unable to provide assistance. However, there were still more than a thousand people being housed in the refugee camp. With the camp on fire, the refugees had no place to go. For a time, they supported the old and carried the young, fleeing for their lives. Their cries to the disaster site could be heard on the British border, and the situation was extremely tragic. As for the number of deaths and injuries, it is difficult to ascertain the exact number due to the inconvenience of traveling to and from the border. It was also reported that nine enemy planes flew over Shenzhen yesterday morning and constantly dropped bombs. It is not clear where the losses were.</p>

<h3>[Flying Hotel] Flight Delayed by One Voyage; Will Only Set Sail at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Boeing-style giant aircraft of Fan American Airways, which made its first trial voyage to Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month, flew back to the United States that day. Originally scheduled to depart from San Francisco yesterday (15th) and carry passengers to Hong Kong, it was suddenly announced that the flight would be postponed to the 29th of this month. It is reported that the aircraft was delayed for two days in the middle of the Pacific due to atmospheric influences on its return journey to the United States. Therefore, the trial flight report could not be submitted to Washington, D.C. on time. Therefore, the date of the official inaugural flight must wait for the review and approval of the Civil Aviation Department. In addition, the aircraft set a new record of 10 hours and 16 minutes for the Guam to Wake Island segment. Also, the Philippine Clipper can arrive in Hong Kong from Manila today. The Imperial Airways aircraft "Tiffin Ness" crashed in Binh Corner last week. After repairs in Binh Corner, it flew from Binh Corner to Hong Kong at 5:45 PM on the 15th, carrying 30 bales of Australian mail and three passengers. British mail could not arrive on schedule due to weather conditions in Southampton.</p>

<h3>Six Thieves with Weapons Rob Two Farmhouses in Tai Tau Leng Village, Sheung Shui; The Jian Uncle and Nephew Lost Over Two Hundred Dollars</h3>
<p>In Tai Tau Leng Village, Sheung Shui, New Territories, two farmers, Jian Shou (61 years old) and Jian Gui (31 years old), uncle and nephew, live next to each other, only eight houses apart. Yesterday morning at midnight, they were successively robbed by eight bandits with weapons. At that time, Mr. Jian and his wife were fast asleep when they were awakened by the sound of prying the door. They were about to go outside to investigate, but the thieves had already entered the house with weapons, threatened them, and forced them to lie on the ground, covered with a quilt. Mr. Jian's wife came out to help, but was threatened and not allowed to make a sound. Then, they robbed extensively, for about 20 minutes, before joining the two bandits outside the door and going to Jian Shou's house to rob. They left a bandit with weapons to monitor Mr. Jian and his wife. After the five thieves arrived, they threatened Mr. Jian and his family in the same way, plundered them, and left with a whistle. After the thieves left, the Jian uncle and nephew ran out to report to the police. The villagers heard the news and came out to chase the thieves, but they had already lost track of them. They went together to the Sheung Shui Police Station to report the case. The stolen items included 14 ten-dollar Hong Kong banknotes, 12 five-dollar Hong Kong banknotes, loose silver dollars, a headdress inlaid with 90 pearls, a gold butterfly worth $15, a hairpin inlaid with 2 pearls worth $2, five silver bracelets worth $5, a black velvet coat worth $4, a woman's clothing worth $3, a red felt worth $3, and a hairpin worth $2, totaling about $264.</p>
<h3>Story of a Thief</h3>
<p>— Falling Sunset</p>
<p>A Serious Social Problem</p>
<p>In the dark and heavy atmosphere, a shouting sound came, awakening the sleeping people around from their beautiful dreams. Everyone rushed out of the door, vying to see what was happening. It turned out that a thief had climbed into the worker's room on the second floor and was stealing things, and had been caught. So, seven or eight burly men surrounded the thief, who was only a teenager and of short stature, and beat him, punching his chest and ribs like raindrops. The thief rolled around and shouted like a slaughtered pig, and the shrill cries stimulated everyone's nerves. Soon, the onlookers could not bear to hear or see this tragic scene and gradually dispersed. The reporter returned to the bedroom, covered himself with the quilt, and still could not forget this tragic scene. After this thief was beaten, he was still tied up. In his sleep-filled eyes, he heard several people interceding for the thief: "Let him go!" Then the thief also cried miserably, saying that he "did such a thing because his family was poor and had no food to eat. Please have mercy on me and let me go!" However, in the end, the thief was sent to the police station at dawn.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to is not the thief's stealing, but why he wanted to steal things. Naturally, he was not a thief from birth. Before he became a thief, he had experienced many things: - Let's look at the newsboys and shoe-shining boys running around on the road, struggling on the edge of hunger and cold. They also have warm families and kind parents, but because of the poverty of their families, these young children began to struggle on the line of life; because there are too many children with the same fate, competition has become fierce. In fact, many shoe-shining boys and newsboys cannot even maintain their own lives. What a miserable situation they are in!</p>
<p>In order to rectify the city's appearance, the police authorities have severely arrested them, hoping to eliminate these children. However, when they are caught and sent to the juvenile court for trial, fines, imprisonment, whipping, and various other punishments are imposed, it is still difficult to eliminate them; on the contrary, because the prison has good clothes, good food, kicking balls, playing games, playing, and having fun, everything is too beautiful for them. They would not even dream of such a beautiful environment. They are a little unwilling to leave that prison! A shoe-shining boy secretly told the reporter the story of how he deliberately tried to get caught by the police and sent to prison, because his family was really so poor that they had nothing to eat! What a sad story this is!</p>
<p>Obviously, these children cannot be caught. Therefore, the incidents of arresting small thieves have gradually decreased. Instead, their shoe-shining tools are destroyed, which only increases the hatred in their hearts. Moreover, because too many arrests have been made, they no longer think that being arrested is a strange thing. We can easily see that a group of shoe-shining boys are often chased by the police like a dragon dance. This is an equally humorous scene!</p>
<p>Education has become estranged from these wandering children. What they learn day and night is gambling, and what they play day and night is poker. Poor gambling and excessive eating are their daily courses. They grow up in this environment. It is not a blessing for society, but a bane for society; thugs and ruffians, thieves and robbers, are hatched from these wandering and uneducated children. What a serious social problem this is.</p>
<p>In conclusion, can we eliminate these thieves by beating thieves like the above, abusing private punishment, and using terrorist means? No, unless we remove the bad seeds that have not yet germinated, that is, make these wandering children have food to eat and have the opportunity to be educated!</p>

<h3>A Guest from Guangzhou Talks About Our Air Force Bombing Guangzhou; Many Bombs Dropped Near Baiyun Mountain; It is Said That Our Eastward Counteroffensive Startles the Enemy Several Times a Day</h3>
<p>Our Planes Attacked Guangzhou in the Morning</p>
<p>The Jinshan steamer returned from the province for the second time yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. According to passengers on the steamer, the steamer sailed from Hong Kong to the province on Tuesday morning of this week and arrived at 5:00 PM, docking at the Taikoo Wharf as before. At about 6:00 AM yesterday (15th), an air raid warning was issued. The enemy military mobilized and guarded the city, preventing pedestrians from passing. In an instant, our planes were seen flying in formation over Guangzhou, dropping many bombs near Baiyun Mountain. The enemy panicked and fought back, firing high-altitude artillery and high-altitude machine guns indiscriminately. The rumbling sound was endless. In an instant, more than a dozen enemy planes were seen taking off from the enemy airport near Baiyun Mountain, but our planes flew very high and the enemy planes could not rush down. They only guarded at low altitude and were still strafed by our planes. The enemy fought for about a quarter of an hour. Our planes were all the latest models and their speed was far superior to the enemy planes. At about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy issued another air raid warning. As for their method of issuing the warning, it was that enemy planes patrolled at low altitude and released the warning.</p>
<p>It is Rumored That We Are Counterattacking Guangzhou</p>
<p>It is widely rumored in Guangzhou that our army is counterattacking Guangzhou. The enemy issued an emergency martial law order and transferred enemy troops to the suburbs to defend. At the same time, the No. 18 and No. 17 enemy warships sailed out of the provincial river and berthed at Humen yesterday morning. It is said that when the Jinshan steamer was exporting, it saw two enemy merchant ships entering the port near the Lianhua Mountain sea area, fully loaded with enemy soldiers. It is said that they were new troops transferred from Taiwan to reinforce Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Chaos is Even Worse Than Before</p>
<p>The chaotic situation in Guangzhou is even worse than before. There are dozens of robberies every day. In this panic, it is truly like a hell on earth. Most of the shops open on the streets are opened by enemy people who forcibly occupy people's houses. When passing through Deye Road, I witnessed enemy Japanese shops being renovated, and the renovation workers were all old, weak, and disabled enemy soldiers. A Mr. Fan took this boat to bring $20 in legal tender back home, but when he delivered it home, his wife refused to accept it, fearing that it would be robbed by the enemy. The uneasy situation in Guangzhou can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Jiangmen, Our Army Advances to Sanshui, the Enemy Attempts to Cross the River and is Attacked; The Enemy Makes Empty Threats and Retreats in the Guise of Advancing; We Wait for the Opportunity in a Relaxed Manner and Strike When the Opportunity Arises</h3>
<p>[Quick News from Zhaoqing] Since our troops arrived in the Xijiang area last month and deployed a strict defense, the strong soldiers north and south of the Yangtze River have prevented the enemy from making any progress in the current situation. Over the past week, our troops have advanced to Heshan and Xinhui, posing a threat to the enemy, and commanding guerrilla teams and special operations teams to penetrate deep into the enemy's rear. The Fourth Theater also ordered the taxation regiment to be under the control of Deng Zhiyi. Tens of thousands of soldiers in Xijiang are closely connected. The enemy army has been transferring troops to Hainan, and its forces are already insufficient. Moreover, it is constantly afraid of our troops' attacks. It deliberately steals across the river at Ma Kou and Ma Fang from time to time, and builds pontoon bridges, making a show of attacking. It is nothing more than a plan to retreat in the guise of advancing to cover up its weak forces. However, our army has long recognized this plan, and every time it approaches, it immediately attacks with mortars, causing the enemy to suffer losses and unable to succeed. Therefore, it has been in a defensive state in recent days. Although our side judges that the enemy cannot launch an offensive on this line, during visits to the Xijiang waterway, enemy shallow-draft warships must harass from all sides. By re-deploying along the river, this trip can be guaranteed to be safe.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Daliang Prepares to Counterattack; The × Bandit Troops at Daliang Are Raising Funds</h3>
<p>[Rongqi Express] After × again occupied Daliang, their troops retreated to Rongqi. At the same time, they sent urgent dispatches to various parties to assist. All local forces belonging to the First Guerrilla Zone, regardless of boundaries, are urged to quickly send troops to assist. On the one hand, they are to defend the Ronggui area, and on the other hand, prepare for a counterattack. × claimed they would advance towards Ronggui again, but whether this is true is uncertain. Recent information about ×'s situation is approximately as follows: Daliang is not necessarily a place of strategic importance in terms of warfare. The reason × has spared no effort to attack it is actually due to funding difficulties. ×'s army in the Shunde area is without adequate provisions. The so-called Guangzhou-dispatched military headquarters is only able to raise 8,000 yuan per day, which is far from the required military expenditure. They are forced to allow × troops in various places to raise funds locally. The × Xiaolin unit in Nanhai, under the instigation of Li Daoxuan, the Nanhai administrative commissioner, believes that Daliang is a wealthy area where much money can be raised. Therefore, they dispatched troops, together with Liang ××, a captain of the Shunde police force, and local thugs, to invade Daliang. Li and Liang, two traitors, want to take the opportunity to make a fortune. The × troops currently stationed in Daliang are divided into four units: (1) the Xiaolin unit, (2) the Songben unit, (3) the Fuchuan unit, and the puppet Shunde police force. The Fuchuan unit is stationed at the Tai Kee store on Haibang Street, the Xiaolin unit is stationed at Baolin Temple, and the Songben unit and the Shunde police force are stationed at the county government and the Xishan area. On the 34th and 35th days, six × speedboats sailed from the Taipinghai waters to Daliang, transporting a large number of bullets. In total, the × army has more than 200 people, with two small cannons and eight heavy machine guns. The puppet Shunde police force has approximately 200 people, all armed with rifles. Judging from the × army's transportation situation, × definitely intends to occupy the area for a long time. As for our side's troops and police force, they are still firmly defending the Rongqi area. Various guerrilla teams going to assist have arrived from Zhongshun and are stationed in Xiaolan, Zhongshan. Yuan, commander of the First Mobile Unit of the First Guerrilla Zone, has, in addition to ordering the 9th Detachment of his unit originally stationed in Rongqi to strengthen its vigilance, also transferred two more detachments to reinforce. On the 3rd, Chief of Staff Jie Renqian was sent to Rongqi to command. On the 14th, Commander Yuan himself went to Rongqi to discuss everything with County Magistrate Su. Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First Zone, also sent personnel to Rongqi to jointly plan military affairs, and ordered nearby local forces to set off to designated locations and await orders. At present, a large army is gathering in the Ronggui area. × will not only be unable to invade, but our attack on Daliang is not far off.</p>
<h3>Anti-War Sentiment of Invading × Soldiers Intensifies</h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Express] The × army entrenched in the Xijiang area has a very complex composition. Most of them are Taiwanese and Korean soldiers and Northeast puppet troops. The so-called formal "military academy" soldiers only account for a small number, and many are merchants forced to come to China to die. Lately, our intelligence agents have often mixed into Sanshui and other occupied areas to talk to × soldiers. They expressed sorrow about the endless war and being forced to invade China unreasonably. Taiwanese, Korean soldiers, and Northeast puppet troops are also extremely dissatisfied with the × commanders due to unequal treatment. Therefore, anti-war sentiment within × is extremely high. According to intelligence, Gao Jianmu and others, members of the Anti-War League, have secretly come to Guangdong and are actively working in Sanshui. The anti-war atmosphere in the military has become even stronger. Anti-war leaflets and publications are spreading rapidly. Incidents such as soldiers committing suicide are constantly occurring. Although × commanders have ordered the execution of anyone who opposes the war and dispatched teams to search for Gao Jianmu and others, all efforts have been ineffective. Therefore, anti-war incidents in the × army have become acute and astonishing actions are expected soon. Furthermore, Koshiki and other investigators dispatched by × to South China to investigate anti-war incidents among the × army arrived in Hekou on the 8th of this month. They were accompanied by × Commander Miyatada and inspected Zhennan, Xinshui, Heqing, Jiujiang, and Southwest, before returning to Guangzhou from Hekou on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>

<h3>Gutian on the Second Line of Eastern Fujian</h3>
<p>[Fuzhou South China News Agency] The highway from Fuzhou via Gutian to Jianning in northern Fujian has recently been completed and opened to traffic. This is a contribution to the transport construction of Fujian Province. In the past, the only route from Fuzhou to the interior of the province was via the Min River. The Gutian-Oulu route adds another land route.</p>
<p>The reporter took this land route from Fuzhou to northern Fujian for the first time. At six o'clock that morning, the sky was covered with dark clouds and the ground was frozen. The Fuzhou station was still very deserted. After waiting for an hour and a half, the passengers packed the carriages, and then the train rushed through the rain-soaked streets of Fuzhou and drove west out of the city.</p>
<p>The rain was heavy, and to prevent raindrops from attacking the soldiers, the train windows were closed. A layer of water vapor condensed on the glass, and the scenery of the fields outside the window gradually became blurred and eventually invisible. When the train entered the boundary of Minqing County, the heavy rain gradually stopped. Looking out the window, a green expanse of fields and mountains unfolded before me. As the car passed, patches of blooming peach blossoms appeared in the green, like piles of snow - particularly cold and beautiful. The wheat seedlings in this area are lush green, the fruit trees provide shade, and the forests on the mountains are dense, mostly pine and fir. Compared with the counties in northwestern Fujian, the production is much richer. The villages seen along the way are also cleaner than those in northwestern Fujian, indicating that the residents in this area must be relatively affluent.</p>
<p>The car passed through Baisha Town, which belongs to Minqing County. Although the town is small, the scene is not deserted. Passengers got off the bus and bought some small cakes and pastries from vendors in the town to satisfy their hunger. From the residents' leisurely expressions, I can gauge their living conditions. The indirect suffering from the war must not be too severe. The Chinese nation is resilient. Although the War of Resistance has lasted for twenty months, there is still unlimited driving force hidden in the vast countryside, which can be used for endless struggles. Compared with industrial countries like Japan, which are prone to collapse, the inherent conditions for a protracted war are clearly much stronger. However, this is also partly due to the government's calm response, which has practically strengthened the nation's internal strength, leading to the current situation where we can cope with composure.</p>
<p>Traveling in the rain, I felt depressed and fell asleep on the train. I don't know when, the train arrived at Gutian Station. The rain was heavy, and there were no acquaintances in the city. I didn't know where to go for a while, feeling at a loss. Later, with the care of a station worker, I was able to find a way to settle down in a simply equipped inn.</p>
<p>At this time, it was the beginning of the first lunar month. Every household in Gutian City was posting bright red Spring Festival couplets, but the traditional auspicious words had been replaced with slogans of national revolutionary struggle such as "Resist to the End" and "Ultimate Victory." This phenomenon proves that the public's understanding of the War of Resistance has gradually become widespread. I remember last spring, when Fujian Province gathered high school students from the entire province and sent them to various counties to engage in civil training work, the students of Yinghua Middle School who were assigned to Gutian County worked especially hard. At that time, their performance was the best in the province. Now that the spirit of resistance in the public of Gutian is flourishing, those young partners from that time should be given a large part of the credit.</p>
<p>Gutian occupies an important strategic position in Fujian's War of Resistance. It is a necessary route from northern Fujian to central Fujian. Assuming the × army lands in Fuzhou and attacks the inland, they must pass through Gutian if they go north along the highway. Also, if × troops land in Sanduao, they will attack central Fujian via Fu'an or Luoyuan, and Gutian will naturally bear the brunt. If the war in Fuzhou occurs in southern Fujian, Gutian can support it. If it occurs in eastern Fujian, Gutian will undoubtedly be the second line of defense for protecting the inland. At present, Fujian Province has already made arrangements for coastal defense, and the deployment of the second-line forces has also reached a considerable level. Regardless of whether the equipped forces will be put to use in the future, the military authorities' foresight and planning are truly admirable.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the Gutian County Magistrate in the rain. In the dim electric light, we talked for an hour. County Magistrate Huang Chengyuan is from Longxi County in this province and has been in office for more than eight months. When talking about his administrative experience and future plans with the reporter, he was clear and organized, indicating that he has a considerable grasp of his work. Of the dozen or so county magistrates in Fujian that the reporter has met in recent months, all are young and strong, and none are old and stubborn bureaucrats. This shows the new spirit of the Fujian provincial authorities in appointing officials.</p>
<p>The public security in Gutian is relatively stable. Occasionally, scattered bandits appear, but they are mostly thieves who rob people on the road. As long as the Baojia system is strictly organized, it will not become a problem. Rural banditry is largely a byproduct of poverty, but the public economy of Gutian is relatively self-sufficient and cannot be considered poor. According to investigations, Gutian produces more than 700,000 dans of rice per year. With a population of 180,000, and each person consuming 3 dans per year, the county has a surplus of 160,000 dans, which can be transported and sold to Fuzhou and Luoyuan and Ningde Counties in eastern Fujian. In addition, there is timber production, which is transported to Fuzhou via the Min River for export, and the income is also considerable. Although Gutian is an import county with an annual import surplus of about 400,000 yuan, there are 6,000 overseas Chinese from the area who do business in Southeast Asia, and the remittances they send back each year can offset the aforementioned import surplus and more. Therefore, in general, Gutian's public economy is sufficient to be self-sufficient. Since public life is easy to solve, public security can of course be assured, and other facilities can also be easily promoted.</p>
<p>However, although Gutian is close to Fuzhou, transportation was blocked in the past due to the lack of roads, and the social atmosphere is still extremely closed. This can be seen from the fact that foot-binding is still very common among women who are sixteen or seventeen years old. Now that transportation is convenient, and education in the form of intensive indoctrination during extraordinary times is implemented, this barrier of the old society will inevitably be quickly overthrown.</p>
<p>"Prosper the interior and build the rear!" This is the highest national policy, and also the only important administrative guideline for Fujian Province at present. Under this decision, Gutian County will undoubtedly be able to enrich its content in the shortest period of time and exert the strength of the second line. By Zheng Wei</p>
<h3>A Tour of New Tamsui (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fu Ran</p>
<p>(II) Feudal Forces and Stubborn Prejudices</p>
<p>Tamsui has always been a society with multiple heads. Among the leaders of this society, there are outdated soldiers, frustrated politicians, newly emerging national capitalists transformed from landlords, gentry in the large villages, and respected members of certain clans... But the most important thing is the opposition between the so-called youth and the old age faction, which is actually the opposition between the youth and the feudal capitalist class. The struggle during the Great Revolution was fierce.</p>
<p>Although the new figures who have taken the stage this time are faithful executors of the united front, they only have national interests in mind, and only one attempt: to mobilize all men and women, young and old, regardless of class or party affiliation, in all of Tamsui. However, because they are all young, some people see it this way: "The youth faction who oppose the old age faction have taken the stage. They will never compromise with the old age, and will always oppose the old age." In fact, this prejudice is really very serious. This is a painful thing. This prejudice makes it difficult for these newcomers to obtain their active help, and they will even not cooperate, or even obstruct and attack them.</p>
<p>(III) Shortcomings of the Salvation Workers Themselves</p>
<p>Indeed, although the group of salvation workers in Tamsui have been tempered by constant work, the shortcomings among them are still unavoidable.</p>
<p>(A) Liberal Style - This is not only reflected in the sloppiness of personal life, but mainly in the lack of enthusiasm in learning and work, which is a lazy, objectively negligent liberalism.</p>
<p>(B) Failure to Make Full Use of the United Front - They believe that every salvation worker in Tamsui understands what a united front is, and is willing to exert their strength to the end for a united front. However, they only passively avoid taking a confrontational or discriminatory stance against all parties, and avoid evil. However, they did not actively strive to win their sympathy and cooperation.</p>
<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3>Jacques Nay's Talk - Creating a Unique Screen Persona</h3>
<p>Four years ago, while James Cagney was working on a film set, a gatekeeper walked over and whispered to him, "There's a kid named Frankie Burke over there who wants to see you. He says he's written you a lot of letters."</p>
<p>A moment later, James Cagney saw Frankie Burke standing in front of him, as if looking in a mirror. He was about ten years younger and four or five inches shorter. Other than that, his face, figure, and expression were exactly the same as Cagney's. Even his voice and wording were not different at all. He was an extremely similar replica. "I'm sorry, may I ask," he couldn't help but laugh, "Haven't we met somewhere before?"</p>
<p>In this meeting four years ago, Frankie told James his hope of becoming James Cagney professionally. First, he had a lot of acting experience, and imitating James was his main job. At that time, James was surprised and amused that the child could imitate himself so vividly. However, he did not say a word of praise for his future hopes.</p>
<p>Then four years passed. For Warner's new film Angels With Dirty Faces starring James Cagney, a child was needed to play James' childhood. Frankie was found again. He played so much like James that it was almost impossible to tell the difference. So many spectators believed it was James himself after makeup during the audition. Later, in The Oklahoma Kid, he further imitated James' recent movements, twisting his shoulders urgently and vigorously waving his hands. However, he felt pain for such imitation. He said to James,</p>
<p>"It's so annoying, I can't find anything else to do, everyone says I look too much like you," twisting his shoulders.</p>
<p>"There is only one way to think about it," James said calmly, trying to stop his own shoulders from moving,</p>
<p>"What way?"</p>
<p>"Don't imitate me anymore."</p>
<p>"Stop learning from you, but this won't work," he moved his shoulders again, "Or maybe I should, but... I've looked like you for so many years, I can't do anything else."</p>
<p>"Look," James said with a quiet smile, "I do my job longer than you do mine. I can always change myself. I think you can definitely change too. I've learned a very important rule, never let the audience see you repeating a similar role, and a similar actor, just like a similar role, can never have good box office power. It can be done occasionally, but it becomes a habit..." He shrugged meaningfully,</p>
<p>"I think we understand what you mean, let me think about it again." Then the director came to call for filming, and the conversation ended.</p>
<p>Frankie only noticed James' appearance, but ignored his personality. We know that James is full of ideals and dares to try. He can create a new character himself. That is why he has today's success. All the successful roles he has played have been created in this way. Frankie can learn Cagney, but he must never become a second Cagney. Cagney's present is made by his past. You can't learn his past, so you can't have the same present and future as him. Of course, Cagney's acting skills also have imitations, but his imitations are taken from his own daily life, this point here and that point there, put together and adopted after many refining operations.</p>
<p>There is an example that not many people know about. That was when James was still a child and lived with his father and brother Bill. The brothers had a trick they often played. Bill grabbed James' neck, clenched his fist, and shook it in his face, saying in a rude tone, "If you're telling the truth, I'll beat your brains out." Then, maintaining this position for a while, the crude air suddenly disappeared, and the brothers embraced each other warmly.</p>
<p>James liked to play this trick since he was a child. After his father died, he still often thought of it. This trick is a symbol of his screen personality in the future. Even after he became an actor, he tried his best to find an opportunity to perform this set in a play. Finally, such an opportunity came. In a film called Taxi, co-starring with Loretta Young, they should always be quarreling. Every time they quarreled, he would grab her neck and say the same words as above. He was so familiar with it that the result was very satisfactory and received great praise. Why, why does a small action have such great success? (This whole action was really 120,000 points successful. People who have seen this film grab other people's necks and learn from him when they walk out of the theater.) It is precisely because it imitates everyday life, and does not imitate the actions in other dramas, so it is fresh and not old. James will never dare to perform it again in other plays after performing it once. "You can't let the audience see you playing repetitive good actions, otherwise it will lose its authenticity."</p>
<p>In Angels With Dirty Faces, James always says a verbal greeting, "Did you hear something? Did you hear it?" This sentence had also been hidden in James' consciousness for fifteen years. He used to know a rude Easterner, and whenever he saw someone, he always said these two sentences as a greeting. It never changed for ten years. James also heard it well, and finally got the opportunity to show it in this film. This is proof that he has studied every character. Similarly, a certain sentence is only suitable for being spoken by a certain character, and a certain expression is only suitable for being used on a certain character. Just as the twisting of the shoulders mentioned above, it also has its origin. A few years ago, he met a friend he had met once, who always twisted his shoulders like this. James asked him,</p>
<p>"Is something biting you?"</p>
<p>"Clothes," he said, "I'm not used to it, it seems a lot smaller than when I used to wear it. You probably don't know... I've been locked up for a long time."</p>
<p>He had just been released from prison. James remembered this and only pulled it out to apply it now. There is also a point that Frankie should know. As mentioned above, James' success today is the result of his past efforts, but this is only part of the reason. The most important thing is his individual character. For example, he is often a brute on the screen, but the James Cagney of Ping Su is completely the opposite, so military people always criticize him for his unreasonable strength and will soon fail.</p>
<p>Here is another thing to prove that he is usually not as unreasonable as he is on the screen, although he was born with such a face.</p>
<p>James' face.</p>
<p>When James first came to work at Warner, a technician named Wallace Wes Moore only exchanged very simple greetings with each other. Later, the two slowly deepened their friendship. During a conversation, Wes Moore said to him, "I think I can say it now," "What?" "Remember the first time we met? You know, I really wanted to punch you at that time," "Why?" "Because of your face, I always thought you were an unreasonable guy. Of course, I know you're not like that now, otherwise I wouldn't tell you,"</p>
<p>What's more, it is enough to prove that he is a modest gentleman, and that is his low soft voice. Whether on the screen or in everyday life, he always speaks in a low voice, so that sometimes, people have to listen carefully. He himself does not like to shout loudly, and at the same time does not want others to do so.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that it is very rare for Frankie Burke to imitate him so vividly for a long time. However, he will never be able to achieve the same voice and status as Cagney. What Cagney said to him also told many people who specialize in imitation and hope to become famous, "Develop your own character and build your reputation." At the same time, "I think Frankie has a lot of hope in the future. He has full energy, and full energy and hard work are the most important elements, and he has both." Naturally, the additional condition is not to get the wrong direction. And some of a true "self".</p>

<h3>A Casual Result; South China South Defeats Little Brother; Unexciting Battle Situation; Score is Four to Two</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] South China South has won the highest position in the Group A League after five months of competition. It is bound to win the championship.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5 p.m., the team played against South China Hua at Jashan. This was a war that was carried out as an example, equivalent to practice. The younger brother also had no need to win, and the victory of the older brother was of course not an attempt to deceive. The general audience knew in their hearts that this battle would definitely be less exciting, so most of them stayed away, and the traffic was sparse and very deserted.</p>
<p>In the South China South lineup, random matchmaking was done. This move was not to underestimate the younger brother, but in fact to understand that the younger brother would definitely concede two points, so the lineup was randomly arranged.</p>
<p>Yang Shuiyi, who had been missing for half a month, reappeared yesterday and looked calm.</p>
<p>When competing, it was casual. Although there was no tension to speak of, there were still one or two things worth watching. As a result, the older brother won by four to one. This was an expected thing.</p>
<p>The first half was two to zero, of course the older brother took the lead. Jingxiang and Manrong made the achievements. The second half was two to two. Jingxiang and Douwen scored on the older brother's side. Shuiyi and Jinhong scored on the younger brother's side. (Taisui)</p>

<h3>Open Tennis Tournament: Chen Zhiqiang Loses to Da Xu; One Singles and One Doubles Match Held Today</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Cricket Club's Hong Kong Open Singles and Doubles Grass Court Tennis Tournament has been underway for several days. After eliminating the weaker players and retaining the strong, it is gradually entering a tense stage. The organizers of the club have hired workers to build a shed and rush to construct the seating area, which should be ready by the fourth week of the competition, allowing spectators to watch the matches in a concentrated area without having to run around. According to past practice, those who sit in the stands pay a seat price, but the general public still has the opportunity to watch the matches until the semi-finals and finals. It is expected that this year's arrangements will be the same as in previous years. Further reports will follow.</p>
<p>Yesterday's program was quite interesting. The most exciting match was between Xu Weipei, the current Hong Kong singles champion, and Chen Zhiqiang, the former singles champion of the South China Athletic Association. In the first set, Chen Zhiqiang lost his composure and was unable to cope, especially with his backhand. Xu exploited this weakness, repeatedly hitting to the left, and won the set 6-0 in one go. In the second set, Chen calmed down and his forehand shots became exceptionally sharp, winning two games in a row. Xu did not dare to slow down and fought hard at the net, leveling the score. At this point, Chen resisted fiercely, saving balls with his backhand, but Xu, with his powerful style, found it difficult to gain the upper hand. The score was tied at 5-5. In the seventh game, Chen was exhausted from running around and lacked the strength to counterattack, ultimately losing the game.</p>
<p>The match between Li Anna and Situ Bi was also quite interesting. Situ Bi initially asserted dominance, winning the first set 6-1. However, he lacked stamina in the following sets, losing both and being eliminated. Overall, the skills of the two players were evenly matched. Although Li was usually impatient, he played very carefully and calmly yesterday, and his stamina was also sufficient. Situ Jian was not good at net play but frequently went to the net, ultimately causing his own defeat.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Singles</p>
<p>Na Xi defeated Ao Linzhen, 6-3, 6-3. Xu Weipei defeated Chen Zhiqiang, 6-0, 7-5. Chen Jinman defeated Cai Bingfen, 6-3, 6-4. Xu Runpei defeated Wang Zesen, 6-1, 6-1. Li Anna defeated Situ Bi, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Today, there will be one singles and one doubles match. Da Linzhen is a well-known and experienced player who should defeat Yi Yunshi. In the doubles match, Luo Dingxian and Liqi's team should also defeat their opponents. Both matches will be held at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Singles</p>
<p>Da Linzhen vs. Yi Yuntu</p>
<p>Doubles</p>
<p>Luo Dingxian &amp; Liqi vs. Liu Mishi &amp; A Fushu</p>
<h3>Mini Soccer Match: Kitchee Defeats Han Ying</h3>
<p>In the Rong Yip Brand mini soccer match, Kitchee played against the Han Ying team at Soton Stadium yesterday at 5 PM. The competition was fierce after the start of the match. Han Zhi's weak defense allowed Kitchee to score goals by Li Zhaorong, Ye Guoying, and Zhu Jincheng, while Han Ying's Tu Bingtu also scored one goal. At the end of the match, Kitchee won 3-1.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Table Tennis Matches</h3>
<p>Tonight, there will be three table tennis matches in the Jianquan Lin Table Tennis Competition, held at the Confucius Society. (7 PM) Xia Ying vs. Jian Nian, (8 PM) Jian Xing vs. Xia Ying, (9 PM) Hua Yi vs. Xie Jin. Xia Ying has a strong lineup and is likely to win. The match between Jian Xing and Xia Ying will be evenly matched. The match between Hua Yi and Xie Jin is also likely to be close, and the outcome is unpredictable.</p>
<h3>South China Athletic Association Begins Recruiting Members; Flag Presentation Ceremony on the 19th</h3>
<p>The South China Athletic Association will soon begin recruiting members for this term. A special flag presentation and departure ceremony will be held at the Confucius Hall at 7 PM on the 19th of this month. Dr. Wang Zhengting will be invited to preside over the ceremony, and there will be various recreational performances.</p>
<h3>Ye Beihua Returns to Hong Kong; May Return to the Field</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The name Ye Beihua has been rarely seen in the sports section of newspapers in recent years, but many fans have not forgotten him.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that Ye is the best left winger in the history of Chinese football and a key contributor to the revival of South China.</p>
<p>After returning from the World Games, he continued to play for South China in the 1936-37 football season. However, because he always played with his best effort and was known for his bravery, he suffered serious foot injuries and had to rest. At the same time, he was working in the Guangdong Provincial Government, which kept him busy. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he was still a civil servant and could not often ask for leave to come to Hong Kong to play football. As a result, Ye retired from the football field for almost three years.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I suddenly met Ye at the Jiashan Hotel and happily reminisced with him. He said, "I just returned to Hong Kong from Shantou this morning."</p>
<p>He told me that last year (lunar calendar) he met old football friends Liang Yutang, Li Huiguan, Li Shengguan, and Li Qiming in Lian County and Shantou. He also played football with them when he had time, but he felt that he was not as good as before because he had been away from the game for a long time. He expressed a sense of nostalgia for the past.</p>
<p>He will be staying in Hong Kong for a considerable period of time this time, and his heroic spirit as an athlete is still evident. It is not yet known whether he will have the opportunity to return to the field and meet the fans again. I believe this is possible. (Donglang)</p>
<h3>Li Anna Applies for Leave; Willing to Join the Eastern Football Team on Their Southern Expedition</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Eastern Football Team is currently preparing to embark on a southern expedition (Haiphong, Hanoi) after the end of the current football season. To strengthen the team, they are recruiting players from outside. Shanghai players Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiushi have also been invited. It is said that Xu and Cao have replied by telegram, expressing their willingness to join the expedition. It is also said that Li Anna and Sousa (a member of the St. Joseph's team) have received letters of invitation from a person in charge of the Eastern team, asking for their opinions on whether they would be willing to accompany the team. Yesterday, the reporter happened to meet Li Anna at the Hong Kong Cricket Club and asked him if this was true. He frankly admitted that it was true and said that he had applied for leave. If approved, he would be happy to go on a trip.</p>
<h3>Let's Also Talk About Children's Sports (II)</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>In ancient China, it was said, "Things have roots and branches," and "If the root is strong, the branches will flourish." There are countless lessons on strengthening the foundation. Many Chinese people know these lessons by heart and should pay full attention to all fundamental undertakings, so that they can be promoted and achieve their missions. However, there are endless contradictions in reality, which I find very perplexing.</p>
<p>Let's start with mothers. Women who are bound by old etiquette embrace the concepts of the "three obediences and four virtues" and "remaining faithful to one's husband until death," seeking only to be good wives and mothers. They only know how to manage the seven daily necessities of firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea, and serve their husbands, children, and in-laws. They never leave their homes. If you ask them to do gymnastics or play ball, they will say that you are creating monsters and doing something immoral.</p>
<p>Women who are infected with romantic habits embrace what they consider hedonism, living one day at a time. They spend their days playing mahjong and painting at night. Their energy is either consumed in mahjong or in bamboo forests, or even in lying in bed and smoking opium, the most harmful habit, which they treat as a way to seek pleasure.</p>
<p>Women who are driven by the concept of beauty only have ideas like "petite and exquisite," "too weak to wear clothes," "graceful and charming," "moving," "lotus-like face," "willow-like waist," etc. They believe that the more delicate and weak they are, the more fairy-like they are. Therefore, they fear that their bodies are not petite enough, their postures are not graceful enough, and their voices are not gentle enough. Thus, strength and development run counter to them and become their enemies, which they refuse to look at.</p>
<p>The evolution of these three aspects—etiquette, romance, and beauty—has made the women of the Chinese nation, the future masters—the mothers of children—weary and lifeless. How can you expect such dying mothers to give birth to lively and energetic children?</p>
<p>Let's talk about children. A person's growth depends on metabolism, which produces fresh blood through breathing and promotes blood circulation through exercise. Then, the blood circulation transports nutrients to the whole body, nourishment is developed, and waste is excreted. Obstacles in the body are completely removed. Therefore, breathing and exercise are indispensable for a growing person.</p>
<p>Growth is a person's natural phenomenon. All the skills necessary for growth do not need to be learned; they come naturally. This is called nature. Since birth, children's daily work is: eating until they are full, moving, sleeping when they are tired, and eating again when they are hungry. They sing the three movements of eating, moving, and sleeping all day long, without ever showing boredom, because they want to grow. The nature of movement is not only related to growth, but also to a person's future. If this activity is not suppressed by human force but guided into a regular way and promoted, it can serve as the basis for all undertakings.</p>
<p>Children's exercise does not require any materials, fixed times, or limited areas, like adults. Their crying in the cradle is natural deep breathing. The actions of stretching and contracting their fists and legs because of crying are natural exercises. The profuse sweat they produce from crying, stretching, and contracting is the same as the profuse sweat that adults produce from jumping and jumping on the sports field. Their unguided exercise is a manifestation of their nature. We should not only not suppress it, but also guide it accordingly.</p>
<p>Parents often misunderstand the meaning of children's crying and movement because they value their children too much. They think that children's crying and movement must mean that they are feeling uncomfortable, and that too much crying and movement will harm their bodies. They even give them something to eat or play with because they are crying and moving, so that they will not cry or move. They misunderstand that the purpose of children's crying and movement is to eat. Therefore, as soon as they cry, they quickly put milk into their mouths, so that they cannot cry. As soon as they move, they hold them and shake them randomly, so that they cannot move. They do not know that their crying and movement are to meet the needs of physiological growth. Eating is also one of their needs for growth. If they are given food and they no longer cry or move, it is because there is milk in their mouths and they cannot cry, or because they have obtained an alternative to the requirements of growth and do not need to move anymore. However, these do not meet the demands of their nature. As a result, their active nature is eliminated from then on and never has the opportunity to develop. Those wooden-headed friends are all raised this way.</p>
<p>When children can walk and move, their movements never stop. Sitting cannot meet their needs, so they climb on chairs and stools. Walking cannot meet their needs, so they want to run and jump. They fall from chairs and stools, or they fall on their heads from running and jumping, cry a few times, and then continue to climb, run, and jump. It is not that they are not afraid of falling, but because they want to express their nature, they feel that not climbing, not jumping, is more terrible than falling. So even if they fall, they still want to climb, run, and jump. Parents often scold them for not sitting properly and not walking properly. Whenever they climb, run, or jump, they use angry words to prohibit them. If angry words cannot stop them, they use beatings. As a result, their lively and active nature is buried under angry words and beatings.</p>
<p>Speaking of the materials for actually implementing children's physical training, there are very few families that can follow children's nature and let them develop. As mentioned above, it is even rarer to use appropriate physical training materials to train children. Before the full development of family education in our country, we should not be too demanding. However, there are physical education classes and physical education teachers in schools. What kind of children's physical training materials do they use?</p>
<p>Based on my experience of teaching physical education in normal schools for more than ten years and what I have seen from guiding normal school students to practice in primary schools, although I dare not say that this is the case everywhere, it is at least so in most places. The only purpose of the children's physical training materials they use is to save trouble. They can be said to completely ignore whether the materials meet the needs of the children.</p>
<p>The most common application is playing ball. The only tools teachers use in class are a ball, a whistle, and a few red ribbons. Playing ball is not absolutely forbidden in primary schools, and it can be effective if taught legally. However, they start teaching how to play ball as soon as students can change balls, regardless of whether the students' physical strength can handle it. They use official rules for teaching how to play ball, regardless of whether the students can learn it. The responsibility they fulfill for teaching how to play ball is to divide into groups and blow the whistle. They do not care about anything else.</p>
<p>The second most common applications are gymnastics and games. It is rare to be able to use these teaching materials. These teaching materials seem to be equal in degree, but in reality, the difficulty varies greatly. The procedures for the physiological and psychological development of children are different at different times. Whether the selection of teaching materials is appropriate greatly affects their physiological and psychological development. What I have seen in various primary schools is that they use the same kind of material regardless of which grade it is suitable for. It can be said that no one truly chooses suitable materials in the order of children's development, or conducts research on whether a certain material is suitable or not after trying it out.</p>

<h3>Talking Parrots</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangtian</p>
<p>In the second volume of "Reading Mirror," there's a quote from Xie Shangcai saying:</p>
<p>"Only when one transcends the realm of fame and fortune can one find a place for respite. Today's scholars and officials are truly nothing more than talking parrots."</p>
<p>This criticizes the inferior behavior of most scholars and officials, who only know how to talk but not act, likening them to "talking parrots." The great Song Dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi also saw this point clearly, saying, "Today's scholars only know how to speak of integrity and righteousness, but when it comes to action, they are neither honest nor righteous." This perfectly illustrates the "talking parrot," capable of speech but incapable of action. How different are these "talking parrots" from the general educated class of our time?</p>
<p>Recently, wasn't there a group in Hong Kong loudly advocating "preserving strength through peace"? But in reality, their goal isn't peace, but rather the pursuit of their own selfish interests. They want to see internal strife and mutual slaughter in China. Their so-called "preserving strength" is merely a desire to see China's mutual destruction be even more ruthless than Spain's. At the same time, they are recommending the Chinese nation to a bloodthirsty demon king, making it forever prostrate at the feet of that demon. The response to Konoe's statement is merely the first step in enslaving the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>If you ask them why they've become so insane, there's no grand reason; it's simply their inability to transcend the "realm of fame and fortune." This corresponds exactly to Xie Shangcai's words, and also to Zhu Xi's statement about "dishonesty and unrighteousness."</p>
<p>If you further ask how parrots can talk, it's simply through learning. As long as it benefits the fame and fortune of a person or faction, they are very willing to be someone's echo. At the same time, they will worship that person as their master and parents, and all notions of righteousness and duty will be forgotten. However, there are exceptions to the talking parrot phenomenon. In the third volume of Liu Yuanqing's "Wise and Extraordinary Anecdotes," there's a passage that can be cited as evidence:</p>
<p>"Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty kept hundreds of parrots in his palace. One day, he asked them, 'Do you miss your hometown?' They replied, 'We miss our hometown.' So he sent eunuchs to return them to the mountains. Several years later, envoys passed by Longshan, and the parrots asked, 'Is the retired emperor well?' The envoys replied, 'The retired emperor has passed away.' Upon hearing this, the parrots all cried mournfully without stopping. The envoys composed a poem: 'Deep in the grass, the birds sing desolate songs; travelers here break their hearts. I cannot bear to hear the parrots still perched on the branches, speaking of the late emperor.'"</p>
<p>If this kind of story wasn't fabricated by spineless literati trying to show loyalty and flattery, then it could be considered an exception. Because these parrots not only could talk, but they could also answer questions fluently, just like humans. However, if we expand on this point, there is really no exception, after all these parrots were merely the echo of a loyal master, eating the emperor's food, they would not be concerned with the safety of the late emperor and upon hearing the news of the master's death, they could actually cry mournfully without stopping. At the same time, the literati, being inspired by the story, started writing "heartbreaking" echo poems, resulting in more and more people intentionally or unintentionally becoming mere echoes.</p>
<p>In the third volume of "Wise and Extraordinary Anecdotes," it is also written:</p>
<p>"Emperor Ming of Tang Dynasty taught elephants to dance. During the An Lushan Rebellion, at a grand banquet for the barbarian chieftains, the dancing elephants were brought out... but the elephants all glared and remained motionless." This is another piece of evidence of animals' loyalty to their masters. In the same book and volume, there is also:</p>
<p>"Emperor Zhaozong had a monkey who could follow the court's routine, and was given a robe and the title 'Sun Attendant.' Later, when Zhu Quanzhong usurped the throne, he ordered the monkey to follow the court's routine, but the monkey went straight up to the throne and jumped and fought fiercely..."</p>
<p>This is another anecdote about animal loyalty. If we ask if all these are true, we cannot know for sure. This is likely another trick of spineless literati.</p>
<p>The above examples all seem to be related. Although animals are of a lower order, they are full of desires for fame and fortune and know how to flatter. The stories are crafted very well. If we judge others by our own petty standards, then the baseness of the spineless literati who fabricated these stories of animal loyalty, filial piety, and gratitude is self-evident.</p>
<p>The same book, volume three, also says:</p>
<p>"Cheng Bochun was traveling in the mountains, and a monk told him that when Yan Yuanxian came south, the monkeys filled the mountains. Yuanxian composed a quatrain: 'I heard that monkeys are fond of salt, when the carriage comes, they fill the mountains to greet it. Where would one see the whipped monkey? Only then I realize that even hairy creatures are worldly.'"</p>
<p>In fact, the last line of the quatrain, "Only then I realize that even hairy creatures are worldly," was conceived by people who judge others by their own petty standards!</p>
<p>Are there any parrots who can "transcend the realm of fame and fortune"?</p>
<p>"The third volume of 'Wise and Extraordinary Anecdotes' says: 'Someone in Dongdu raised a parrot and, out of compassion, gave it to a monk. The monk taught it to recite scriptures. Often it would sit motionless on the shelf, and when asked why, it would reply, "My body and mind are unmoving in devotion, seeking the supreme path." When it died, it was cremated and yielded relics.'"</p>
<p>This, like the parrots' mourning for their master, is all fabricated. Talking parrots who can't act are sometimes ridiculously embellished.</p>
<p>Some people still believe that if things are "correct in name" and "reasonable in words," then they can be done. But after seeing the parrots' mimicry, they will probably laugh it off, especially when those who advocate are a flock of parrots whose names are not correct and whose words are not reasonable!</p>

<h3>Random Notes on War Dogs</h3>
<p>— Lü Ping</p>
<p>Ever since humanity has had wars, dogs have begun to join their ranks.</p>
<p>When primitive people lived in caves and the wilderness, dogs served as their guards, helping them to resist all external invasions.</p>
<p>The Zhou Dynasty established the official position of "Dog Handler," belonging to the category of "Harmful Elements," specifically in charge of the training of dogs. Although it cannot be confirmed that dogs were used in warfare at that time, it is clear that dogs were being trained by humans.</p>
<p>From murals, we can see that the Egyptians were using dogs as tools of war as early as 4000 BC. The Celts used sharp steel blades to attach to the dogs' collars, driving them to assassinate the enemy. King Henry VIII of England sent four hundred fierce dogs to Charles IX, helping the Spanish defeat the French army. As for dogs serving in modern warfare, engaging in rescue, communication, sentry duty and other tasks; it was Germany who created this in the First World War.</p>
<p>A dog's sense of smell and hearing can reach within half a mile, eight times more acute than humans. They have a strong memory and can recognize more than two hundred kinds of slogans.</p>
<p>A German army dog was used under heavy fire to find the locations of five wounded soldiers, and the soldiers were able to survive because of it. A Belgian police dog created a record of teaching two thousand people in one year.</p>
<p>In Belgium, war dogs are incorporated into mechanized units; using them to drag machine guns is even more reliable than war horses. In the Soviet Union, dogs wear gas masks to rush to the front lines, specializing in pulling mine carts. Each war dog can carry forty-five pounds of ammunition. If equipped with simple devices, they can also install telephone lines for convoys.</p>
<p>A French war dog named "Bing" can be considered one of the most glorious war dogs. In addition to being able to do the work that other war dogs can do, it can also identify the smell of poisonous gas shells, and the lives of thousands of soldiers have been saved by its warnings. Therefore, it has received many honors and awards, and it is also the first war dog to receive a state pension. When it died of old age, it was buried with military honors.</p>
<p>In Europe today, war dog training has become a common thing. The Ashchurch military dog school in England is the largest training ground for war dogs, with two thousand war dogs graduating each term. Other countries, such as Russia, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, all have war dog school facilities, and there are even many hospitals specifically established for war dogs, just like hospitals for wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of the Old Man</h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>The sharp, cold north wind savagely swept through the bamboo forest outside the village, and a kind of sorrowful sigh constantly spread into the distance with the wind, just like the complaints of all the unfortunate in this era of suffering.</p>
<p>Since yesterday, the people of this village have been fleeing like frightened birds, for who knows how many times. Perhaps the war has taught them to be smart? The women and children must all be taken away, and as for the local militia, some cowardly fled, while some brave ones entrenched themselves on the hilltop, waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy. Those who remained, apart from some stubborn old men and some old women who were determined to defend their homes to the death, were only many ownerless livestock.</p>
<p>The goose's cry announced the rising sun. The group that had fled only stopped their weary steps after traveling for some distance. They looked back at the fields and houses they had left behind just the night before, twenty or thirty miles away, and only saw clouds and smoke filling the air, the distant trees and mountain peaks woven into a hazy image. A terrible riddle was painted on their hearts: What will the enemy do with our homes and belongings? But no one could give them an answer.</p>
<p>On this day, those old men who did not leave also did not sleep well. The village head, Yang Shangyi, that old fellow, was even preparing to welcome the enemy. Doing this job was really not easy. On the one hand, he had to entertain those messenger traitors; this didn't seem too difficult. But on the other hand, he also had to tell those young men not to resist, which was problematic. However, in any case, he had decided to do so.</p>
<p>The next day, as the dismal sun was about to rise, a dozen enemy soldiers arrogantly came to this village. The traitor led them straight to the village ancestral hall, where a hideous "welcome meeting" had been prepared.</p>
<p>Several senile old men, wearing long robes and mandarin jackets, and even wearing red hats, bowed and kowtowed three times to welcome the enemy soldiers to the banquet.</p>
<p>The enemy soldiers gleefully sipped their wine and, taking advantage of the alcohol, stood up with beaming smiles, muttering unintelligible sounds. Following this, a traitor, shamelessly putting on a smiling face, translated:</p>
<p>"The Great Imperial Army needs chickens..."</p>
<p>The old men in long robes and mandarin jackets hurriedly replied:</p>
<p>"Uh, uh, uh... good, good, good..."</p>
<p>"The Great Imperial Army needs pigs..."</p>
<p>"Uh, uh... good, good..."</p>
<p>"Need white rice..."</p>
<p>"Uh, uh... good, good..."</p>
<p>"Need cows..."</p>
<p>"Uh, uh... good, good..."</p>
<p>After a moment, the translating fellow said again:</p>
<p>"Also, need girls..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>When he said this, the old men looked at each other, silently, their faces covered with a layer of desolate gloom.</p>
<p>Before long, the enemy soldiers arrogantly left, giving strict instructions before leaving:</p>
<p>"All these things must be delivered by noon today!"</p>
<p>When the time came, the old men listened to a lot of people, leading cattle, carrying chickens and pigs, and carrying white rice, and sent five old men who were so-called "skilled in dispatching" as leaders - naturally, the village head was one of them. According to the location previously specified by the enemy soldiers, they presented these many "hard-earned" things to the enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>The time was neither early nor late, the long and short hands of the clock coincided exactly on the Arabic numeral twelve. But the enemy soldiers shouted impatiently:</p>
<p>"Huh, why are you so late!"</p>
<p>"It's just twelve o'clock, sir!" The old village head said in a gentle, womanly voice.</p>
<p>Another enemy soldier, with a special mark on his shoulder, probably some kind of captain, inspected the delivered items, then raised his thick eyebrows, made a face even more terrible than the devils, snorted, and then cursed:</p>
<p>"Why didn't you send the girls!" These words came from the mouth of that shameless traitor.</p>
<p>The five old men were all so frightened that their faces turned green and then white, and their beards trembled with shaking. The old village head shivered and said in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Sir, because the daughters have left, we cannot send them for a while, later..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by an unintelligible word.</p>
<p>The enemy soldier with the mark on his shoulder said something to the other enemy soldiers, and several enemy soldiers responded by waving their shiny bayonets and approaching the old men whose souls were not attached to their bodies.</p>
<p>With a sound like a sword piercing clay, followed by several screams in the air; thus, on the desolate, withered grass, lay five withered corpses. The cold wind whistled and sang their elegy.</p>
<p>But the enemy soldiers, smiling, put away the delivered items and planned another new action.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>The maidservant lowered her buttons and wiped the snow off his shoulders again. The more experienced servants were, the more they would show small acts of diligence in front of the guests; sometimes, it would not stop until it was nauseating. Like her. The guest being served by her was almost cramped from the service. Finally, he evaded her and asked:</p>
<p>"Where is Miss?"</p>
<p>"Oh, how muddle-headed! I forgot to find Miss for you, sir."</p>
<p>"No hurry."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I thought too. Sir, you might as well sit for a while longer. The weather outside is really cold!..."</p>
<p>"You should go and ask Miss to come first!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll go right away."</p>
<p>He called her back again. He asked:</p>
<p>"Where is Miss?"</p>
<p>"In the living room."</p>
<p>"Are there any other guests?"</p>
<p>"No. She's practicing the piano there alone. Sir, don't you know that Miss loves to play the piano? Her friends all know! Speaking of her friends, they are really too good, I have never seen a bad person. Our Miss really didn't grow those phoenix eyes for nothing, she really knows friends!" This talkative maidservant seemed to never stop talking. He listened absentmindedly, thinking:</p>
<p>"You talkative old woman, were you mute when you were young?" She thought her words could please the guests, but she didn't know that the result was the opposite. So she continued to say: "Speaking of her friends, they are really too good! And they all seem like big shots!" At this moment, he wanted to say:</p>
<p>"I look like your ancestors!"</p>
<p>"For example, sir, your blessed appearance must be that of someone who does great things, with both sons and daughters, all the way to old age. At that time, sir, don't forget that there is also a poor old woman here, who has talked with you." He was already angry listening to her, he wanted to shout:</p>
<p>"This old woman, only the genitals of a male horse can shut her mouth!" (Nine)</p>
