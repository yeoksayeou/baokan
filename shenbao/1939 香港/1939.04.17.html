<p>— 項英</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>（二）民運工作的成績A根據半年來的實際工作來看，我們的民運工作在一般的地方是建立起來了，無論在前方後方，正因為我們民運工作的努力，民衆運動是相當的發展，在我們作戰的地區周圍，組織了廣大的民衆，這可以說是我們的成績。B我們在多數的民衆中間，建立了相當數量的民衆組織，尤其是靠近皖南我們軍隊的周圍及我們皖南部隊的周圍地方比前方效力更大。C因為我們相當的注意了民衆生活的改善，使得在這地區的民衆的抗戰認識的提高，他們對於抗戰的參加不是變成一個形式的而是有行動的能够在某些方面適應抗戰的需要。D我們特別在前方建立了一般民衆的武裝。許多不好的民衆的武裝，經過整理，訓練，使他們成為抗戰部隊。E由於我們民運工作的成績，使本軍與民衆眞正打成一片，尤其是在前方能够得到羣衆很大的帮助，這是我們成績的主要幾點。</p>
<p>今後江南戰局的趨勢</p>
<p>我們說今天江南戰局的趨勢，可分兩方面來講，一方面是×人的動態，一方面是我們今後的方針。</p>
<p>（一）×人動態的推測A首先拿戰爭形勢來說，現在×人還是防禦的反攻以防禦為目的的反攻，在江南皖南都是這樣，根據整個的戰局變化發展來看，江南局勢可能而且必定由防禦的反攻進到對於江南地區游擊區域大規模的進攻，整個戰略轉到積極地進攻游擊區域。B第二，　在軍軍說，拿過云的經驗來看，日本帝國主義對付我們的戰術可能大部份的採用中國內戰時的辦法，或者築堡壘作　點，修築公路，一個橋樑，一個城市都作為據點。所以我們說×人在戰術上可能採用中國內戰時對付游擊戰爭的辦法，當然不是完全的搬過去，而是增加上他自己的戰術，這說明我們要注意到日本將來戰術發展的形式，同時我是也用過去的經驗，而且根據今天的形勢，發展我們過去的經驗，C第三。就是日本帝國主義用了各種方法收買些不堅定的，動搖的武裝和游擊隊，而瓦解和削弱我　抗戰的力量，另外他還要組織許多新的偽軍，造成他進攻游擊區域的力量，實際達到以華制華的目的，我想在軍事上，政治上都有這種可能。D第四。關於進行政治的分化，×人用各種方法來挑撥離閒，以分化中國的力量，分化中國抗戰的團結，使一部份人意志動搖，他用恩惠，也用威力，恩威並濟的威脅動搖份子，破壤整個中國人民的團結。分化這些區域的抗戰力量。E第五，是進行經濟的壓迫，一方面對游擊隊進行封鎖政策，一方面在其他地方大批銷售日貨，利用中國的材料，大批收買中國的材料，實行對中國資源的武裝掠奪，收場並　養大批漢奸與兩面派，建立他的政權，鞏固對於佔領區域的統治。這是大體描測×人可能的動態，我們在這樣情形下，×人採取了這樣的政策，我們應當採取什麽方法對付他呢？</p>
<p>（二）我們今後的對策第一，我們以後政治重于軍事，光靠軍隊力量不夠，一定要從政治，經濟，軍事的觀點上發動游擊戰爭，一定要靠政治力量動員民衆組織，發動民衆，依靠政治與軍事相配合，以政洽力量瓦解×人，揭破，人的欺騙，堅定動搖分子，鞏固全民團結，第二，民衆重於軍隊，只有軍隊，沒有羣衆團結在周圍，是孤立的軍隊，在這樣困難的情形下堅持抗戰是不可能的，所以發動民衆，組織民衆，武裝民衆，比軍隊還重要，第三，宣傳重於作戰，×人用分化，破壞手段來瓦解削弱我們的力量，我們要揭破×人的欺騙團結民衆到抗戰中來，同時以宣傳來瓦解×軍內部，這樣宣傳工作比打仗還重要。第四，精神勝於物質，我們的軍隊對抗戰的認識還不够，所以要把我們軍隊的政治工作加強，把頭腦武裝起來，意志確定起來，這樣才能百折不囘的鬥爭下去。第五，為了開展這一個地區的抗戰局面，一定要使游擊戰爭成為羣衆的游擊戰，而不是單獨軍隊的游擊戰爭，是羣衆的武裝鬥爭，而不是單靠軍隊的行動，只有這樣才能够時時刻刻給×人以打擊，第六是運動戰與游擊戰配合，只有游擊戰是不行的，一定要同時運用運動戰，不斷殲滅×人給×人更大的耗費，使×人在全國這樣大的地區，兵力不够分配才能使他只能守着幾個據點，而不能維持廣大地區的統治。第七我們認為今後作戰一定要軍事，政治指揮統一，使軍事和政治合於我們的戰爭要求。為了便於戰爭，非政治與軍事配合一致不可。第八，在經濟上對鎖×人，而自己要有辦法，要能自給，我們認為在這樣戰爭趨勢上，在×人動態上說，必須採取這些原則與方針以爭取今後戰爭的勝利，及第二階段抗戰的開展與完成，以便達到很快的把我們的力量準備好，爭取我們的反攻階段的迅速到來。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>最後的結論：我們結論很簡單，是三個結論，合　作一個總的結論。</p>
<p>甲。根據一年來的抗戰經騐，我們應該：（一）發展我們在這一年中所得到的成績與我們的優點。（二）改正我們在這一年的抗戰中間所存在的缺點。</p>
<p>乙。根據一年來的教訓，我們應該：（一）堅強我們政治工作，發揮我們政治工作的效能到最高度。（二）不間斷的提高我們的軍事技術到必要程度，使適合於我們作戰的要求。（三）澈底肅淸游擊主義習氣，使我們軍隊一切入於正規。（四）根據這個教訓鞏固和健全各種制度，使我們的軍隊成為一個最靈活而有最大效用的一座機器。</p>
<p>丙。根據今後作戰的趨勢，我們應該：（一）學習運動戰使游擊戰與運動戰配合起來。（二）我們要到處組織和發動羣衆的游擊戰爭。（三）加強我們的宣傳工作和民衆運動。（四）要把×軍工作（卽對×軍的宣傳和爭取他們反叛的工作）在全軍中間開展起來，變成我們全軍作戰共同的工作，同時變成廣大民衆的抗戰工作。（五）保持和發揮我們新四軍的優良傳統。而且要創造我們新的優良傳統作風。這是我們適應着二十八年的戰鬥任務，第二階段的抗戰任務，並完成第二階叚的任務，只有這樣才能使我們一天一天的健起來，使我們一天一天的把弱點克服。我　在總結這一年來的經驗與教訓，不僅是為要找出我們的成績、而主要是認識我們的成績是從什麽地方來的，同時找出我們的弱點，在抗戰中有些什麽妨碍，怎樣克服？使我們成為最健全，最有力的一個抗戰軍隊，使我們能在抗戰第二階段中有更大的買獻，有更大的勝利來完成我們的任務！（完）</p>
<h3 id="c2">我們的農業五年計劃 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c3">前線的新氣象 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>汪與平沼的秘密協定暴露以後，×奸策動的『反共』『和平』陰謀又遭一次重大的打擊，抗戰前線氣象，亦復為之煥然一新，特別值得重視的是西北我電之東渡黃河出擊晉×，是冀察晉我軍之長驅關外展開東北抗戰，是隴海我軍之分攻開封徐州重創×軍，是平漢津埔沿殘游擊之再度活躍，是鄂皖贛湘和蘇浙皖贛邊區游擊戰之大規模發動，尤其是華南方面我軍之分從增城花縣佛山等地造成包圍廣州的形勢，這種戰略優勢的實現，實可謂抗戰二十餘月以來所僅見的新氣象，無怪平素以立論嚴謹著稱的英倫『泰晤士報』『每日快報』』每日電訊』等，亦已一致讚揚目前我國抗戰之業已取得優勢了。</p>
<p>我們要認淸，目前抗戰前綫所以發現這種新的氣象，主要的是由於我　全國人民與將士一致擁護政府最窩領袖堅決抗戰到底的精神，是由於我們全國各民族各黨派各階層的堅強團結，是由於我們政治上軍事上經濟上和外交上的長足進步，同時還由於國際民主和平各國反侵略陣線的成長和全世界對我抗戰的同情援助，如果我們能夠確切認淸這些主要原因，我們能够進一步保持並發展這些主要原因，則抗戰前線將有更可樂觀的新氣象發現，直到最後勝利的實現。</p>
<p>但是同時我們還要　淸，目前抗戰前綫這些新氣象，並不是我們業已進入『戰略反攻階段』的徵象，而祇是抗戰由防禦的第一階段轉向相持的第二階段的必要步驟。因為我們知道，×人正在企圖利用德意侵略者在歐洲進展與英法處境困難的局面，加緊其在遠東的軍事的投機冒險的步驟，以便鞏固其佔領地區，樹立統一的強力的傀儡政權，進而以『反共』『和平』運動為輔助，完成降服全中國的計劃。我們目前抗戰前綫普遍展開的攻勢，便在藉以打破×人這種計劃，阻止×人的進攻，進而增加×人的困難，削弱×人的戰鬥力，促進相持階段的實現，準備戰喀反攻的遂行。</p>
<p>根據這種對於目前抗戰的新的認識，至少就應該明白：適應目前已經實現的這種新氣象，我們必需保持及發展這種新氣象，即須迅速切實的增強我們前線的戰鬬力，廣泛發展×後的游擊戰，同時加緊後方新生力量的培植，和戰略反攻一切準備的推進。這是我們全民族目前抗戰的總任務。為要順利完成這个任務，必須大家竭盡心力保持前述抗戰勝利的那些至要原因，我們要切實的實施國民精神總動員綱領，提高民族自尊心與自信心。我們要努力肅淸漢奸肅淸『反共』『和平』等漢奸言論行動，擁護堅持抗戰爭取最後勝利與眞正的和平。我們要鞏固與擴大全國團結的抗日統一戰線，和國際上反侵略的和平陣綫，以便集中全民族的力量與集中更多更大的外援。而當此前線初呈新氣象之時，我們全民族尤其是海外僑胞，除了上述任務以外，還須加倍踴躍同國囘鄉服務，還須加倍踴躍捐輸錢物　　　　　救濟難民，還須加倍努力宣傳鼓動工作，爭取國際對我的同情與援助。前線的新氣象，已以勝利的光輝，照明我們奮鬥的大路！</p>
<h3 id="c4">張發奎將軍與李蒙夫婦會見記 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>中國之友在中國（八）</p>
<p>十九日淸晨我與李蒙從一間茶館裏『飲茶』回來，對於許多甜點心，他表示十分贊嘗。剛跨進　舘門口的時候，茶房告訴我張司令長官部巳打電話來過了。然而他却不知道這是誰打來的，和講些甚麽話。為求得早點拜會　來粵坐鎮的『鉄將軍』張向華先生起見，我遂搖了个電話到司令部去。出意料之外得很，來接電話的竟是張將軍本人，因此，我便向他表明來意並約定會晤的時間；他說現在他正忙於開會，定於十二　派人來接我們。有了這個約會，我們便靜心地坐候自鐘打十二下的時候了！</p>
<p>十二時，果然有人來敲着房門，進來的那是个很精幹似的軍官，上唇幾根短鬍髭。彼此交換了卡片，原來是副官處的梁科長。在地的邀請之下，我們到達了司令部的會客室。剛剛坐下，裏面房間內跑出了一隻高而且大的獵狗，它嗅了我們每一个人的脚，然後很和順地躺在我們的　邊，它似乎告訴我們，主人就要出來了。這時候，四圍的空氣似乎突然緊張了起來，寂寂地毫無聲音，一會兒，張先生含笑跨出了邊門，並不高大的身材，瘦瘦的個子，具有一般廣東人所存「短小精幹」的特色，正如夏衍兄所說的一樣；北伐戰爭中咤叱風雲的虎將，「中國鉄軍」第四軍的創立者，指揮長官，××總司令，隊軍上將……從這些聲威，經歷和歷位，我很奇妙地聯想到一位張桓侯式的豹額虬髯的將軍。可是，當他出現在我們的前面，殷勤而熱烈在握着的時候，他却是一個身材和我們相仿，具有一雙善良而常常湛笑的眼睛的智識階級。並且，据說他還愛打網球游泳……活潑潑地有大學生的風度，說話的時候，兩片小鬍髭不住地兩邊　動，增加了不少和善的成份。當李蒙問到廣東軍事狀况的時候，他說『我到此地不久，所以知道的還是一個大體上的情形，一切詳細的狀况，可以將來請問余副司令，他自然比我熟識，這種謙虛和藹的神氣，使我們不住為廣東的前途慶幸，以往廣州的教訓；告訴我們人事上的協調，是絕對足以增進工作效果的。接着，向華先生說『廣東一共為九十七縣，現在×人所佔領的區域不過幾个縣城和幾个大鎭而已。這也就是×人的最大弱點，在中國這樣的廣大土地和衆多人民的國家裏，他是決無力量作更進一步深入的，並且，從廣州失守之後，廣東游擊隊的數量己很快地增加，人民自動起來殺×的事實已有過了不少。以目前講，可說是×我對峙的局態，在各綫上都無大的戰事，皆不過為小接觸。游擊隊和正規軍的配合也格外嚴密起來了。現在×人在廣東的力量也十分薄弱，總共亦不過六七萬人而已。』；在最近的將來，廣東是否會有發生大戰事的可能呢！；李蒙夫人好奇似地問，『當然是有可能的，依我看來，此地不外兩个路向，一個是×人的進攻，另一方面是我們的反攻。這兩个發展都是足以引起大戰事的。』當然前者的可能性較後者為大，我們反攻的力量還在培養中，反攻的時機也還未成熟。並且，如果開始反攻的話，這也必然是全國的整个戰略問題而非廣東單獨的行動。最後，張將軍說『由於一年來參加戰事中所得到的一個認識我深信最後的勝利必然是我們的。現在事實已告訴我們×人是不善於山地戰的，在上海的時候×我雙方死傷的比率大概為一與四之比。我們死傷四人則×人死傷一人。到了隴海路之戰的時候，其比率巳成為三與一之比，我們比之從前已可少死一个人了，至於到了九江之役，死亡率的對比則成為二比一，現在慢慢地將有到了相等的可　　　後，作戰的區域將大部份皆為山地，交通格外不便了，行動自然也因之困難起來，在我們，倒可以由於地形的不便而節省許多彈藥；在×人却要產生不少新的困難。何况我們的軍隊愈打愈強士氣益戰益盛在×人後方游擊區亦日漸增廣。自然，這許多情形都是可以使一个同情中國的外國朋友對於戰局的前途抱樂觀，可以深信我們必然取得勝利。同時，對於遠道而來的朋友，我表示致最大的謝意希望你們將法西斯日本在中國的狂行暴露於國際人士的面前，使每一個人都能瞭　中國實已具備着訂多必勝的條件。』這種包藏着無限精力的堅實詞句，表揚出這位久戰沙場的名將是个何等慄悍的人物。在互相願望着中法關係不新地改進中法人民加緊團結的情緒下，我們向站立在轅門口的張先生點首道別。</p>

<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>【本報特稿】一九一三九年三月二十三日、守禦汨羅河以北我進陳地的第×××師、在第×××軍張××軍長指揮下、奉命自新墻河出擊、任務是佯攻　漢路北段當前×軍的三個據點、正面是郭鎭市、左翼麻塘車站和右翼新開塘、以牽掣在贛北猛攻南昌的×軍、</p>
<p>從上年十一月初起、岳陽全咸寧問的×軍在趕築據點工事後、便祇由小部隊——包含新兵和偽軍——留守、在岳陽方面的×軍掛着第九師團的番號、蒲圻戚寧的是第六師團、他們知道面劉自己的就是在魯南和瑞昌打得他們發抖的關部、所以在白天縱然成羣結隊的在附近的鄉間打家刦舍、好淫據掠、一到晚間、便躲進園着二道鐵絲網的各據點裏去、以防不時驀然來襲的游華部隊、</p>
<p>第×××團第三營的營長程甲黃、率領着本營的戰鬥兵由新墻河附近的宿營地出發、他在北伐時曾為國民革命流過兩次血、『八一三』以來又先後在上海、魯南和瑞昌負過傷、多年的陣中生活使這位鄂中健兒　得鐵樣的剛強、那套草黃色呢軍裝巳經在他身上過了兩個冬、却仍像新的那樣挺有樣子的穿着、紫膛色的方臉、睜着兩顆有威嚴的圓眼、使弟兄們覺得他可敬可畏、他和老百姅談話時特別和靄、對弟兄們講話、總是說中國在蔣委員長領導下。一定有辦法、又使老百姓和弟兄們覺得他可親可愛、</p>
<p>五個月了、他們經過冰雪滿山到黃花遍地、進出在粵漢鐵路廢基以東的山野裏、現在、程　長和他的部下、比回到各人的故鄉還嬰熟悉、對於那些和平的村舍、有的巳將傾圯、有的還在建造、就覺得像自己家裏的一樣、總感到親切、有一次、他們在這邊山上眼看着×人拆卸那些村舍的樑柱用去構築工事、有幾個弟兄直氣得咬牙蹬足、要求衝下去殺他們一個干净、他安慰着他們說、「總有那一天、我會奉命和你們一起去撲殺他們、』</p>
<p>湖南的山野、和湖南的農民同樣可愛、黃土的邱陵有時露出赭黑的巨石、少年的松林、和　似乎數不淸層數的梯田、就好像在對每一個人說、「這就是建國必成的保證之一、」這幾天、不時下着春雨、田　裏巳蓄滿了水、一層層的向低處吐瀉、山腰襲、時有裹着黑布包頭的農夫在泥水裏跟着牛走、聽到山下沙沙的　聲　便一手拉住牛繩、一手遮着頭頂上的陽光往下瞧、那閃光的槍　、那倒映在水田裏的花邊樣的單行縱隊、他帶着微笑直看到那最後的一個、他體會到這些弟兄是去打×子的、說不定自己的兄弟也是其中的一個、</p>
<p>路邊、農家的門啓開了、這一帶時常有鬼子兵出沒、婦女和孩子不能讓他們見得面、都進入偏僻的山坳裏去、壯年的在田裏耕作、老年的坐守在家裏、不看見自己的軍隊不開門、當尖兵經過他們的田隴、他們知道後續部隊即到、就趕忙用松柴燒起開水、盛滿一大桶、帶幾只組碗、在路口等候、要宿營、就把珍實的草料搬進屋子裏去為開、把自己的牀舖硬讓給官長們睡、</p>
<p>繞過鷹嘴山取道沙冲、隊伍從大山以西、麻布大山的右側背繞到右前方、這瞌　三八〇·五　　山、適介於新開塘和麻塘車站之問、北市郭鎮市只十五里地、先頭部隊和×人的警戒部隊接觸了、子彈爆出淸　的音響、然後一一拖着蜜蜂的　音似的尾聲、劃過山空、我們的盛氣緊緊的高壓着敵方、使他們不能不零落地潰下「皇軍」的可憐的屍體、向北逃竄、我們一部經桃花洞附近側出東北、破壞新開塘與　鎭市間的毛里舖附近的橋　、大部繼續向西北推進、</p>

<p>三、青年群</p>
<p>靑年羣所遭遇的情形，和抗青前衛團差不多、而在廣州退出後損失較重，現在人數只餘約卅人，其中一部分參加曲江縣黨部工作，一部分參加省黨部工作，工作中心　重民衆學校。</p>
<p>四、新運會婦女工委會</p>
<p>廣州失陷後的婦女運動，一個時期是非常沉悶的，最近才由李主席夫人吳菊芳女士發起組織婦女訓練班，培養婦女幹部，將來分配各地負責開展婦女運動，重張旗鼓。按：全國性的婦女工委會是由蔣夫人領導，各省則由省主席夫人主持。</p>
<p>五、四戰區政工大隊</p>
<p>這個大隊來曲汀不久，從前一向是隨政治部各地作交通通訊及部隊工作，主要的任務是使民衆與軍隊接近，從組織訓練教育中做成軍民合作。來了曲江後，除了一般的口頭文字宣傳之外，還創辦了幾間民衆夜校，他們自己斟酌當地情况，編訂民衆課本。</p>
<p>六、軍委會第五政工大隊</p>
<p>這隊是腎留曲江的，將來預算赴西江，在軍隊裏祖負政訓工作，以前在始興，翁源等地流動工作的。軍委會曾有第一演劇大隊到來曲江，演過幾齣國防劇、獲得廣泛的大衆歡迎，他們的募捐籌款入場券、是人人搶着買的，因為隊裏多是在戲劇界有相當素養經驗的人，如趙丹也在這一隊。</p>
<p>七、省救護委會第一大隊</p>
<p>這是全省著名的救護隊，以前曾在實安增城前線工作，現暫在曲江，將重返前線。社會人士對他們都很敬仰。</p>
<p>八、社會服務處</p>
<p>社會服務處由省黨部主辦，是一種半團體半機關式的組織，目的在以服務社會，建立民衆的良好關係，辦有民衆學校，民衆問事處，職介紹所等。「初到貴境」的同胞如有疑難問題，當可盡量設法幫助解決。</p>
<p>此外，保安政治大隊和縣民教館，都是對民衆教育和宣傳，民教館有　報處，民衆週會，時事座談會及識字班等</p>
<p>這兩天、由西江調返之動委會政工隊，抽考其中約一百人，集中縣立中學內訓練，由第四戰區司令部主持辦理，訓練三星期後卽分派往各游擊區工作。在第二階段中，此項工作的重要，無待　言，希望當局繼續分批訓練，大量輸送到淪陷區，到×後五發動牽制，騷擾，　擊，殲滅×人的游擊戰，尤應注意把淪陷區裏的民衆組織起來。</p>
<p>上面不過將此地各救亡團體情形，作簡略的介紹，因記者路經曲江，以二日時間　留，走馬看花，當有許多不詳不盡之處，還望各社團常常將活動情形報告出來，互相交換觀摩，互相鼓勵餐促，朝着抗戰建國光明大路邁進！</p>

<p>【路透社華盛頓十五日電】據此間今日宣稱、總統羅斯福頃向希特勒及莫索里尼呼籲和平、在致兩獨裁者之電文中、羅斯福曾向彼等徵詢是否確願提供保證、担保不以武力攻擊下列之獨立國家、電文中略謂：「此種保證、不獨適於目前之期間內、而須適用於未來、俾維持永久和平之辦法、獲得推行之機會、如吾人將目光放大、吾願向君解釋所謂世界「將來」之疇範、不侵畧之保證、極少亦須為期十年或二十五年、如此種保證獲得貴政府之同意後、鄙人將卽行轉達其他各政府、諮詢彼等是否同意提供同一保證」、至是羅斯福列舉芬蘭·愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞·立陶宛·瑞典·挪威·丹麥·西班牙·瑞士·力喜騰斯泰因·廬森堡·波蘭·匈牙利·羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·蘇俄·保加利亞·希·土耳其·伊拉克·阿拉伯、敍利亞、巴力斯坦、埃及、伊蘭　荷蘭、比利時、英國、愛爾蘭、法國及葡萄牙諸國、羅斯福謂、彼將以友好之中間人自居、以轉達和平保證、如相互保證和平、皆經提供、則世界各國、便可舉行談判、從事裁軍及開放貿易途徑矣、統總文內極力陳述世界各國畏懼戰爭之一般心理、略謂、此種恐懼之存在、實與美國人民有絕對之關係、而深悟任何大規模之戰爭、縱然限於別個大陸、而其影響勢必嚴重及於美洲、並將延及數代云、其結論曰、過去數週間、舉世處於惶惶不可終日之緊張局勢中、然迄今猶幸未有軍事之動作、則世人最低限度亦應有片刻之將息、余以為此乃余對君等佈達微衷之絕好機會矣、</p>
<p>【路透社華盛頓十六日電】羅斯福總統致獨裁者電文中所列之獨立國家、未有但澤、鑒於柏報方面之報告、希特勒或將於下週攫取但澤、此實極為重要者、美國駐莫斯科代辦寇克、巳奉令赴柏林替代業已逝世之駐德代辦吉爾勃、美駐德大使威爾森、於美德關係未改善前似不致返任、羅斯福總統之電文中、雖未提及捷克、奧大利、阿爾巴尼亞及阿比西尼亞均已被倂吞、然此非表示在外交上承認此等士地之被征服也、</p>
<p>【路透社華盛頓十五日電】總統羅斯福、今晨召集外交界顧問、舉行特別會議計出席白宮會議者有參議員特門、國務卿赫爾及國務副卿威爾斯、會議開始時、柏林所登載之波蘭西利西亞發生反德事件、及希特勒或將採取行動強併但澤之消息傳至此間後、曾引起一度之驚擾、</p>
<p>【路透社華盛頓十五日電】海軍部突令艦隊開囘太平洋、並未解釋理由、按當局原定四月二十七日在大西洋正式舉行艦隊檢閱、該艦隊並曾準備開往紐約參觀世界博覽會、此次命令之來、實屬出意外、據外交界解釋、此舉實為接獲情報之證明、羅斯福總統感覺羅馬、柏林、東京及爾哥斯有同時發動之可能、故有實行預為防範之必要、因此將艦隊重行調囘太平洋、以對抗日本之威脅、</p>
<p>【美聯社華盛頓十六日電】美國艦隊奉令、取消參加紐約世界博覽會及諾福克海軍操演、於裝滿燃料後、即行駛囘太平洋、此次美政府所發出之命令、略謂「各艦應即駛返太平洋原防」、除新建之大西洋艦隊外、所有全國之艦隊均須立卽囘防、至於發出此命令之理由、政府禾加解釋、惟據一般人推測、實與歐局緊張有關、此項命令係羅斯福發表　請和平之宣言後兩小時內發出、據一般人推測、美當局認為有集中艦隊在太平洋以防萬一之必要、尤可注意者、卽英國海軍實力現已集中歐洲沿海、以便應付戰事、美政府頒發令令、數年以來並未有如此短促時間之內發出者、據一般人估計、各艦裝滿燃料、約需三日、駛返原防、約需十三日至十四日之時間除原有大西洋艦隊、與巡洋艦五艘、港水艇六艘、航空母艦一艘需留美國東部外、約共有戰艦一百二十艘須卽駛返太平洋、計共有戰艦五十六艘參加世界博覽會之表演及「其他任務」、至於歐洲艦隊之一小隊、則並不受此項命令之影響云</p>
<p>【美聯社華盛頓十六日電】美艦隊昨忽奉令開往太平洋、聞係接得情報、謂國際局勢、將急轉直下、遠東亦將　入漩渦中又據另一消息、歡洲倘再有新軍事行動發生、荷屬東印度將必被牽連、而菲律濱亦受影響、又有某外交家發表意見、謂美艦隊之移動與羅斯福最近同希特勒提出之建議有關、至謂比舉乃在防止日本侵略、因日本或將乘歐洲發生戰爭之際、擴大其侵略行為、則似屬非確、因日本在東三省及中國各地必須出全力應付中國之抗戰、同時、日本實力己在中國虛耗甚多、日本對美國艦隊之活動、似必須加以警惕、尤以英國在新加坡佈防、日本更不敢妄動云、</p>
<h3 id="c17">全英熱烈嘉許　法無條件接納 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>【路透社倫敦十六日電】美總統羅斯福、向獨裁者籲請保證和平、巳獲得英國全國之熱烈嘉許</p>
<p>勞合喬治稱、此為「對于理知之偉大及合特的籲求」、阿特里氏則謂「一極有價值之初步工作」、羅斯福總統之電文中有謂「閣下一再申述閣下及貴國人民並無戰爭之意、如此係確實、則無須戰爭矣」　此間各報對於該段電文、極為讀揚、美總統在電文中指出人民之恐懼、必須予以結束後稱、「吾人不幸、必須認識新事實、在歐洲有三國家、非洲亦有一國、均巳喪失獨立、在遠東方面、復有一獨立之國家、其廣大之領土、已為一鄰國所佔、吾人相信之報告、並非確實者、此項報告表示、復有對於其他獨立國家、企圖再事侵略、簡言之、世界現正向一可產生大禍患之途前進、除非能推求一較為合理之方法、始可避免戰禍也」、此段電文甚為此間人士所注意、羅斯福總統又稱、美人並不自私、恐懼或懦弱而發言、余以強大之實力及為人類之友好、而有所申述也繼稱、「國際問題可在會議桌上獲得解決、此非軍方之事、在會議室一如在法庭、雙方均須以至誠信心互相討論、預示雙方均將獲取實際之利益也、」旋羅斯福總統於解釋美國提出友好之調停後稱、『汝願保證不以武力侵略下列諸獨立國家耶、』</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十五日電】首相張伯倫及外相哈立法克斯、頃聯名代　英國政府發表一文、對於羅斯福總統之措施、熱烈歡迎、並謂英政府「對於總統之品評國際形勢意見、完全同意、」該文繼謂、「吾人相信羅斯福總統此種政治家丯度之建議、已令各國皆心存憂慮之悲慘局面、得以避免」、該文末謂現須靜候德意答復、然固希望其答　「能開始進行羅斯福總統所言第二步之途徑也」、</p>
<p>【路透社倫教十五日電】此間美大使館參事詹森氏、今日訪英外部、向英當局報告羅斯福總統致希特勒及莫索里尼電文之內容、聞美總統此舉、事前並未與　政府商討、截至今晨止、英政府對羅總統之意向、亦未有何暗示、英首相張伯倫、現正在鄉間別墅消度週末、外相哈立法克斯亦在其約克郡之鄉間寓所、均已獲悉該電文之內容矣、</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎十五日電】法總理連拉第頃以牒文遞交駐法美大使貝立特、轉達羅斯福總統、表示法國方面對於美總統之建議予以毫無條件的全部接納</p>
<p>此間認為美總統之電文、足令國勢情勢、頓改舊觀、「巴黎時報」謂、「希特勒個人、向以有意維持和平者自居、此乃希特勒向其人民及全世界提供證明之時機矣、</p>
<p>【路透社奧太華十五日電】此間對於羅斯福總統向獨裁者籲求保證十年之和平事、認為「大胆敢言」、表示讚佩、</p>
<h3 id="c18">德決拒美建議　意國尚守緘默 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>【美聯社柏林十六日電】據可靠消息、希特勒已完全拒絕美總統羅斯福之建議、對於召集和平會議與不再侵略兩點、均加拒絕</p>
<p>【美聯社柏林十六日　】據可靠消息、希特勒與莫索里尼互通電話、商談美總統請保證和平之建議後、對於美總統之提議、决予拒絕、聞希特勒將發出正式拒絕之答覆、或不予答覆、德宣傳部刻尚未能證實莫索里尼對於美總統之建議、亦已拒絕、唯謂、莫里尼拒絕羅斯福之建議、甚有可能云、</p>
<p>【路透社柏林十五日電】希特及外長里賓特羅甫均於今午抵慕尼黑</p>
<p>（希特勒來自白樞台斯加登）聞兩人現正互相研究維斯福總統之電文、官方自晨至晚、忙於翻譯、以供希特勒覽　、據路透社消息、該文並無引起過分之興奮、慕尼黑方面、將不致召開大會亦無特別惹人注目之活動、今晚亦不致有公佈發表、聞希特勒在星二日前不致重返柏林、半官方及報界對羅斯福之電文、表示絕對不歡迎、某報評論云、「羅斯福之電文實已誤投」云、</p>
<p>【海通社羅馬十六日電】截至昨晚止意官方對羅斯福之電文、仍守絨默、未作何種批評、聞該電之發出、幷非經尋常外交手續、而為羅斯福總統個人之致電意相、此電現仍未在意發表、官方何時止式批評此事、刻亦未知、聞莫索里尼與戈林將軍于昨晚七時會談時、曾討論此電、</p>
<p>【路透社羅馬十五日電】一般推測、現方密切會晤中之莫索里尼及德航空部部長戈林定必對羅斯福之來文共同縝密研究、莫戈兩人隨復聯袂參加意王及后之歡讌、莫索里尼並於國會會議後提出二十分鐘接見訪問者、截至現在、聆悉美總統來文者僅一小部分之人、而官方則竟謂不知其事、</p>
<h3 id="c19">暹羅與越南 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>假如暹羅投入法西斯集團的懷抱、自然要使英國在逮東的殖民地感受威脅、可是法屬越南、却比英屬緬甸更處於危險的地位、因為假如暹羅一旦加入了德意日的軍事同盟、它首先要收復鸞拍老朋和百丹朋、此外法國保護地老撾和東浦塞、是也暹羅所要奪取的目的物、為的是老撾和東浦塞兩個民族、遠在十六世紀的時候、已經是被暹羅征服了的、這些地方喪失之後、越南領土去掉大半、加上日本從海南島方面進攻、越南決不會再是法幽的越南了</p>
<p>日本侵略華南和佔領海南島、這已便法國的遠東殖民地、為之寢食不安、加上暹羅自從上次大戰以後、軍備實力一天天增加、國內早已實行徵兵制度、戰時可動員陸軍數十萬、近年暹羅又建立海軍、從德國日本定造了戰艦和潛水艇、空軍也有相當的規模、一到了戰時、不用說是越南背面最危險的故人、所以越南和暹羅的關係、是法國在遠東殖民地安全問題中最可焦慮的一點、</p>
<p>英法對付暹羅、也像對付西班牙佛朋哥政府一樣、想用借欵通商種種利益當作了引誘的、希望緩和對英法的衝突、就　國與暹羅的關來說、最近數月來有相當的成功、越南與暹羅的商約於數月前僉字、現在己經過法國和暹羅的國會雙方批准了、法國三月前派軍官團前往盤谷聘　、這次越南軍隊及諒山附近大操、暹羅也派了兩個軍官前來閣操、目暹羅與越南表面上持着保善鄰關係、這是實在的、可是我們知道侵略國沒有一刻會停止搗亂的陰謀、一旦歐洲戰爭煤發、法國在遠東的軍力削弱、那時候、亞洲南部會演成怎樣局勢是沒有人能夠保證的、為了保護他在遠東的利益、法國將倚靠怎麽力量、這不巳是太明白了嗎、</p>

<p>自由談汾水的西岸  沈思　　天上馳着幻麗的雲彩，夕陽依依地　着群山的峯項；冷風吹來了恐怖的夜，黑暗像巨大的野獸，　在地上，吞滅了山陵，農莊，河流，樹林，跳動的大自然的心……　　澈夜準備着出發的事情，把文件書藉收拾好，便開始做行軍時的標語，謎語，叫宣傳員帶到速隊里面去，以解戰士行軍時的疲乏。　　從老百姓家里借來的東西，分別的送還了。　　我向屋主致了謝意，告訴他半夜就要離開這里。　　老屋主不聲不響坐在坑上，像為無限的心事糾纏着；一會兒，吞吞吐吐的自語起來了。　　「世界變了，絕子滅孫的××連小孩子也不放過，……」　　我知道他為汾陽城里的故事苦惱着。　　在汾陽失陷的日子，據說，『皇軍』一怒殺掉了男女老少，一共二百個人；從北門到東門的房子，一把火燒了，烈焰沖出了冬日的晴空；照着三四十里以外的農莊。『同志，我跟你打遊擊去。』他囁嚅地向我說。他底緊張的臉，表現着憤怒和痛恨。　　『老鄉，你不要去，在鄉里凑合一些小伙子，藏在山裏，　着鬼子，就和他幹一下……』　　『同志，不行，我要和你們一起走，祗有八路軍××才怕。老雖老了，但我可以當火夫，請你和團長說一下，……』　　我看到這位老鄉很堅决，把他的意思和楊說了。　　星星點綴着黑暗的夜，風嗡着。　　到××村的時候，雞已經叫了。　　迷茫的山霧，在熹微的晨光中甦醒了；被霧隔斷了的山巒，隱約地和我們擠着調情的眼眉。　　黑夜死滅了，從東方浮起來的光明，統攝了這一個世界。　　戰士們的性緒很高，一路歌唱着。　　『……沒有吃，沒有穿，自有那×人送上前，　　沒有槍，沒有砲，敵人給我們造，……』　　老戰士淡着平型關，正太路的故事，在那些沒有過戰爭經唸的戰士心里，漾着新奇，神秘的波紋。　　從下　到郭家掌九十里的路程，我們只走了八點鐘。　　飛機在天空高高地偵察着：晉西全綫的戰事，已經緊張了。　　山中的積雪，漸漸溶化；滑細的溪流，汨汨地穿過着　　的童山；太陽光暖和的曬在身上。　　從　九谷到川口鎭的公路，已被×人佔領了，我們今天宿營在大麥郊東北二十里的地方。　　一陣一陣的砲聲，從山頂上飛過來，大家預糾大麥郊有激烈的戰爭。夜里，從破壁中吹進來的凜冽的山風，驅走了軍營巾的夢，黑暗緊壓着不　的心懷，幽咽的犬吠聲，長久地停留在不眠人的耳際。人類的同情心  時光　　人與社會的關係是建築在互助同情上的，我很相信這一句話；但，有許多耳聞目睹的事實，又使我懷疑這句名言。　　譬如：在路上有人跌一交，兩傍的人看見了會拍手大笑。鄉里人　到都市，走不慣馬路被汽車夫撞倒，險些兒送命；但汽車夫不會停住了車去把他扶起來。反而會大大地罵他『屈死！』　　一個小整三站在馬路旁捉白虱，人們會擲一道鄙夷的目光給他，一個殘廢者沒有了脚，跑起路來，靠兩隻手艱難地爬，人們見了不覺得慘，反而會引起一陣笑聲　　强盜和賊，大家都覺得可惡，大家都會唾罵他們，其實，賊和强盜的本　未必定是壞的，還不是整個社會制度的不良，而造成他們的不良？况且無論如何，他們的行為總比出賣民族利益的漢奸，高招得多。　　人　應當有的熱情，有同情互助的『心』除去對於眞正「要不得」的以外。　　今日的中國人，每一個都該拿出偉大的同情心來，不過，無疑地，這同情心是有看正義感的。因為憂人之憂樂人之樂的心是可取的，却不能給予敵人，來助長他們的兇燄，否則正義要在世界上滅種了。工作  玫影　　『起來，不願做奴隸的人們……』　　歌聲，旗子，給甜美的春風蕩漾着前進。温和的陽光照着正在田岸上走着的我們！一小隊，彎彎曲曲，隨着阡陌前進！　　我們雖然出發了四天，但我們工作不偷閒，團結的精神，愈來得堅同。一個個給陽光晒得需，的面孔，顯出一雙雙黑××的眼睛。三位女同志比我們更勇敢，沿途分發着救亡的傳單，唱着『婦女進行曲』、使正在忙着的農婦，停了農作傾聽着那甜美的聲歌。　　快近海邊了，望見隔岸（海山）的大概。我們快樂起來，同時肚子却　在鳴叫着。想起今夜要回到海山表演話劇；又想那里公所曾經熱烈歡迎的情形，那鮮美的飯菜，我們一定要盡力的出演纔對。　　『站住！在這小屋前作此地最末一次表演。』校長嚴肅的臉孔對着我們，又指若拿旗子的我意思是呌我準備着。大家就分別的工作起來，化裝啦，借桌椅啦，敲鑼敲鼓啦，忙了一會。村內的男女老幼都來了，圍成一個圓形。小孩子們笑哈哈的等待着。　　當我大略地報告各戰場最近戰訊後，一位女同志就開始解釋放下你的鞭子和其餘二幕短劇的劇情，使他（她）們容易了解。這樣，話劇就開始了。　　一幕劇完了以後，我們中間還間挿着演說啦，歌唱啦，個到問答啦，使他們不會覺得時閒相隔太久。　　一共演三個短劇。他們又熱烈的要求再演一幕，因此勇敢地把一幕舞台劇打××鬼也演出來。他（她）們有人流着淚呢。眞是被劇中人感動得太厲害了；尤其是那些農婦們，更會同情劇裏的農婦啊！　　天漸漸的黑起來，一陣陣的海風夾着一陣陣熱烈歡送的掌聲，把我們送上航船。我們囘答着他（她）們一隻雄　的歌曲：　　『動員，動員，要全國　動員！……』叛逆的兒女  紫金　　當我還沒出國的時候，在上海，總時常看到××大學裏那一羣來自榴連的國土的『黑大漢』，習性　悍，豪華無度，腦子又簡單到只　得錢，汽車，洋房，蘇州的女人——事無大，小，黑，白，壹律都用「粗拳」解决；個個就像是法國路易士，斐列普所刻劃的那個渾名叫「葡萄」的穆里司，三句話不對，眼睛睜得圓圓地，一下子準就：　　「媽的！」一大窩兒蜂擁上前，「打！」　　在酒樓上，在急管繁絃的舞場裏，他們時常這樣地使酒鬥氣，為了『海蓮』大演鏖戰「特洛依城」。或者敎　的「學分」不給通融，抽出小刀威嚇也沒甚希奇。像這樣，這班「黑大漢」給予人們的印象當然很槽，甚至有許多人以為：凡是生長在赤道上的，都是這一型的『粗坯』，說得不　聽些，那便是：『蠻東西』！　　然而這是個不小的錯誤，就同一班學者斷章取義地讚揚莎士比亞一樣地錯誤，如其一個人到過赤道上，獲得一他們所生的「總印象」，之後，他便會如此地感覺到了。　　赤道上是炎熱的，香草永遠是碧油油的，陽光長年火樣地　炙着。而赤道上的中華兒女們，也是那麽熱情那麽像火似地燒炙着：率直，勇武，激昂挺進。當暴×構兵，中國像巨人樣地豎立起來捍禦的時候，他們和她們的這種力量，便發揮得更猛，更大，一片暗鳴叱咤聲，響澈了整個赤道上：「囘中國去！」「到戰場上去！」「為了國家」，他們對于那一班懾于飛機大炮的恐×病患者的嚇嚇語，一刀劈斷，「怕鳥！」　　語言卽是他們和她們的行動，從緬甸，從暹羅，從英屬馬來半島，從荷印的藩土上，……，後備軍一陣陣地流向苦難的中國。在抗×軍政大學和陝北公學，在救護隊裏，在黃塵　　的疆場上，那個地方沒有他們和她們的蹤跡？英國詩人白期寗的這兩行行詩歌，赤道上的中華兒女們是永遠值得引為誇耀：「我永遠是戰士，以寡敵衆，奮鬥到死。」　　這世上，黑暗的魔鬼扇起翅膀。到處都在翻翔着。在L地就曾經發生過一件「離奇百出』的事：一位中學女生，誓志從戎，背了父母，和兩個志同道台的「黑大漢」乘輪返國，當輪船到了S埠的時候，却給她的令親打電報囑海關連同男的一起扣留了起來，接着便押送回家。一班「蚩蚩者氓」的封建餘孹，穿上道袍，粉墨登場，都帮同着作祟了「拐誘私逃，不行！控告！」報館裏那班「無　帝王」也像煞有介事的，在報章上大書特書：『世風不古——冒名從軍，誘女私奔！』　　之後，不知怎麼一來，那兩個「黑大漢」很僥倖地不受『控告』而又自由返國；但那位中學女生，却給她的令親監銷起來了，就像希臘神話中的女郎普賽克被　娜絲幽囚在孤寂的塔中一樣，不能自主地跑動一步。卽使他們的女兒蔭庇在閨闈中。日久馴成了像神女賦裏所說的「旣姽嬧於幽靜兮，又婆娑乎人間」的那種女性，在這時代裏不知又有甚麼用？這却是個疑問。做父母的本來給兒女當「墊脚石」也不够，反而做了兒女的『壓頂石』，對自己和對國家，都是應該內疚於心的罪人！　　在赤道上，如同蘇俄聶維洛夫在他的一本描繪帝俄時代的動亂的小說裏所說：『男人囊着，女人囊着，聽不見的只有老年人的聲昔。」那班熱血在沸騰着的中華兒女們，往往所碰到的便是這種「壓頂石」。他們和她們在未投到烽火的故國的懷中之前，得先經過一番苦鬥。　　「救國？行麽？」一聽到兒女們在這危難的日子要囘國。老年人就叱責了：「單靠你一個？哼！」　　另一方面，央幾們同樣腦筋的親朋戚黨，力加婉諫。再不聽話呢？好，準走你的！旅費是根本別開口。看你『小皮蟲』怎樣挿翅飛過重壘的關山，飛過汪汪的海洋？　　遭樣起勁地當「絆腳索」，還不是為的：要是兒女們有個天高地厚，嗣續斷了，赤道上的金黃色的遺產又怎樣去安排呢？在抗戰的時期，中國一班上輩人抱這種糜爛思想的，大概還「大有其人」吧！正也不足多怪。但赤道上的中華兒女們，性格是堅韌的，意志是　决的；也無須你去說甚麽敎，他們和她們的腦筋都知道得很淸楚，暗中找借了一筆，够到中國的『盤纏」，昂起頭，揚起步伐，穿過一重重的難關：「走」！　　作為「壓頂石」的老年人把他們和她們當做一群亂飛亂撲的小毛虫，仰天太息了，「小毛虫，怕不叫××人活活打死？唉！叛逆的兒女呀！」　　然而事實却不然，××人却給這些小毛虫括活打死了！　　赤道上的叛逆兒女們，是中國國力底另一行來源！滿洲的雪  舒羣　　但並無過分的疑慮，彷彿雙方已經互相得到信任，祇有臉上，還遺留着一種驚動以後的未平靜的神情，有時，會出現一絲兩絲不安的皺紋。這在別人看來，却很難窺破他和她之間的奧妙；也許以為他們不是情人，便是好友。為了不必要的小事而爭吵過，雙方都不肯退讓，各自還故意地保留着一種矜持。　　他和她走過的街道，很少遇見行人——如果有，也幾乎都是野妓。她們希望在僥倖中等到一個浪子，或是一個淫漢，從他們的衣袋裏取得明月的衣食，所以她們不忍離去這風雪之夜而還在徘徊，不過。對於他和她。不但不注意，而且厭煩；因為她們最厭煩帶有女人同行的男人。此外。大槪祗有十字街的警察了。他們為了抵抗風雪的寒冷，把臉面盡量地埋進大衣領里，兩脚不停地練習着一種太自由式的舞蹈，卽使有汽車的聲笛響來，也引動不了他們固定的姿態，對於他和她，當然，更不留心了。卽使他們看見他和她，甚至發覺他和她之間的秘密。如果他們不是金錢的奴隸而忘記記自己祖國的叛徒，必然改過他，還有她；難道他們不知道自已為了最低的生活費而在×人與叛徒的下面扮演着如何的丑角嗎？　　二十分鐘以後，他和她走盡了這夜路的終點，前面便是從窗內透出的等待歸者的燈火。　　這里，是木條圍成的院牆。院內，有一所巨大的樓房。這是一個富人的家產。賃予旅居的富人暫住的。　　在幾天前，他和他的幾個同志，化裝着紳士子弟向這樓房主人租下兩間；一方面固然由於避免外方的注意——因為貧窮的外貌，是多疑的，有時候。也是犯罪的，另一方面便是為了她——因為她是富家長成的富人，他們不願她在這短期的居留間，從生活上結下任何難忘怨言。所以他們不僅無心傷害她，而且盡了一切的可能，使她舒適。　　然而，她却帶着反感的心情走進院門，房門。她走上樓梯的時候，脚下羽毛一般的地毯，眼邊富麗的壁畫……所有的一切，她望着那不如自己家中的那般適　。在她進了房間以後、第一個更不愉快的印象，便是那些陌生者從她的到來取得的放縱笑聲，並且，有人喊着：　　『歡迎啊，我們的財神！』　　還有：　　『歡迎啊，雨文同志！』　（卅九）</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Fourth Army's Experience and Lessons in the War of Resistance (III) <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Ying</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>(II) Achievements in Mass Mobilization Work A. Based on the actual work of the past six months, our mass mobilization work has been established in most areas, whether in the front or rear. Precisely because of our efforts in mass mobilization, the mass movement has developed considerably. We have organized broad masses of people around our operational areas, which can be said to be our achievement. B. We have established a considerable number of mass organizations among the majority of the people, especially around our army in southern Anhui and in areas surrounding our troops in southern Anhui, where the effectiveness is greater than at the front. C. Because we paid considerable attention to improving the lives of the people, the people in this area have a heightened understanding of the War of Resistance. Their participation in the War of Resistance has not become a formality but is active and able to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance in certain aspects. D. We have especially established popular armed forces among the general populace at the front. Many poor popular armed forces have been reorganized and trained to become War of Resistance units. E. Due to the achievements of our mass mobilization work, our army and the people have truly become one, especially at the front where we can get great help from the masses. These are the main points of our achievements.</p>
<p>Future Trends of the War Situation in Jiangnan</p>
<p>When we talk about the trends of the war situation in Jiangnan today, we can divide it into two aspects: one is the movements of the × people, and the other is our future strategy.</p>
<p>(I) Speculation on the Movements of the × People A. First, in terms of the war situation, the × people are still in defensive counter-offensives, with defense as the objective, in both Jiangnan and southern Anhui. Based on the overall changes and developments of the war situation, the situation in Jiangnan may and will inevitably move from defensive counter-offensives to large-scale offensives against the guerrilla areas in the Jiangnan region. The entire strategy will shift to actively attacking guerrilla areas. B. Second, in military terms, based on past experience, the tactics of Japanese imperialism in dealing with us may largely adopt the methods used during the Chinese civil war, or build fortresses as strong points, construct roads, and use a bridge or a city as a stronghold. Therefore, we say that the × people may adopt the methods of dealing with guerrilla warfare used during the Chinese civil war in their tactics. Of course, they will not completely copy them, but will add their own tactics. This shows that we should pay attention to the future development of Japanese tactics. At the same time, we should also use past experience and, based on today's situation, develop our past experience. C. Third, Japanese imperialism will use various methods to buy off some wavering and unstable armed forces and guerrilla units to disintegrate and weaken our War of Resistance forces. In addition, they will organize many new puppet troops to create a force for attacking guerrilla areas and actually achieve the goal of using Chinese to control Chinese. I think this is possible both militarily and politically. D. Fourth, regarding the implementation of political disintegration, the × people will use various methods to sow discord and division to divide China's forces, divide the unity of China's War of Resistance, and cause some people to waver. They will use both kindness and power, using both favors and threats to sway wavering elements and undermine the unity of the entire Chinese people. Disintegrate the War of Resistance forces in these areas. E. Fifth, is to carry out economic oppression, on the one hand, implement a blockade policy against the guerrillas, on the other hand, sell Japanese goods in large quantities in other places, use Chinese materials, and buy Chinese materials in large quantities, implementing armed plunder of Chinese resources, and raising a large number of traitors and double-dealers, establishing their regime, and consolidating their rule over the occupied areas. This is a general description of the possible movements of the × people. In such a situation, what methods should we take to deal with them when the × people have adopted such policies?</p>
<p>(II) Our Future Countermeasures First, our future should emphasize politics over military affairs. Relying solely on military force is not enough. We must launch guerrilla warfare from political, economic, and military perspectives. We must rely on political forces to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and launch the masses. We must rely on the combination of politics and military affairs, and use political power to disintegrate the × people, expose the deception of the people, strengthen wavering elements, and consolidate national unity. Second, the masses are more important than the army. An army without the support of the masses around it is an isolated army. It is impossible to persist in the War of Resistance under such difficult circumstances. Therefore, mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses are more important than the army. Third, propaganda is more important than combat. The × people use divisive and destructive means to disintegrate and weaken our forces. We must expose the deception of the × people and unite the people to join the War of Resistance. At the same time, we must use propaganda to disintegrate the internal ranks of the × army. This propaganda work is more important than fighting. Fourth, spirit is more important than material. Our army's understanding of the War of Resistance is not enough, so we must strengthen the political work of our army, arm our minds, and strengthen our will, so that we can fight on relentlessly. Fifth, in order to develop the War of Resistance situation in this area, we must make guerrilla warfare a mass guerrilla war, not a separate army guerrilla war, and a mass armed struggle, not just an army action. Only in this way can we strike the × people at all times. Sixth, mobile warfare should be combined with guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare alone is not enough. We must simultaneously use mobile warfare to continuously annihilate the × people and give the × people greater consumption, so that the × people can only guard a few strongholds in such a large area across the country, and cannot maintain rule over a vast area. Seventh, we believe that future operations must have unified military and political command, so that military and political affairs meet the requirements of our war. For the convenience of the war, political and military cooperation must be consistent. Eighth, in terms of economy, we must lock the × people, and we must have our own methods and be self-sufficient. We believe that in such a war trend, in terms of the movement of the × people, we must adopt these principles and guidelines to win the victory of the future war, and the development and completion of the second stage of the War of Resistance, so as to quickly prepare our strength and strive for the rapid arrival of our counter-offensive stage.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The final conclusion: Our conclusion is very simple, it is three conclusions, combined into a general conclusion.</p>
<p>A. Based on the experience of the War of Resistance over the past year, we should: (1) Develop the achievements and advantages we have gained in this year. (2) Correct the shortcomings that existed in the War of Resistance this year.</p>
<p>B. Based on the lessons of the past year, we should: (1) Strengthen our political work and maximize the effectiveness of our political work. (2) Continuously improve our military technology to the necessary extent to suit our operational requirements. (3) Thoroughly eliminate the habits of guerrilla-ism and make our army all regularized. (4) Based on this lesson, consolidate and improve various systems, so that our army becomes the most flexible and most effective machine.</p>
<p>C. Based on the future trend of operations, we should: (1) Learn mobile warfare so that guerrilla warfare is combined with mobile warfare. (2) We must organize and launch mass guerrilla warfare everywhere. (3) Strengthen our propaganda work and mass movement. (4) The work of the × army (ie, propaganda to the × army and the work of winning them over to rebellion) should be launched throughout the army and become the common work of our entire army's operations, and at the same time become the War of Resistance work of the broad masses. (5) Maintain and develop the excellent traditions of our New Fourth Army. And create our new excellent traditional style. This is our adaptation to the combat tasks of the 28th year, the War of Resistance tasks of the second stage, and the completion of the tasks of the second stage. Only in this way can we make ourselves healthier day by day, and make us overcome our weaknesses day by day. Our summary of the experience and lessons of the past year is not only to find out our achievements, but mainly to recognize where our achievements come from, and at the same time to find out our weaknesses, what obstacles there are in the War of Resistance, and how to overcome them? Make us the most sound and most powerful War of Resistance army, so that we can make greater contributions and greater victories in the second stage of the War of Resistance to complete our mission!

<h3 id="e2">Our Five-Year Agricultural Plan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) In order to develop agricultural production nationwide, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specially approved the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to issue agricultural bonds and plans to complete a five-year agricultural plan, handle agricultural loans to increase agricultural production, plan reclamation to develop cooperation, and purchase major local products. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Complete a Five-Year Agricultural Plan</p>
<p>The purpose of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank is to adjust agricultural products, circulate funds in the industry, and seek the development of rural areas nationwide. When necessary, it may submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request the government to approve the issuance of agricultural bonds, but the amount is limited to the total amount of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's fixed capital. The general manager of the bureau, He Lian, has considered the industrial and transportation conditions, delineated regions, and established agricultural adjustment offices to handle agricultural adjustment affairs during the extraordinary period, and plans to complete it within five years. The agricultural divisions are (1) farmland water conservancy, (2) increasing agricultural production, (3) planning reclamation, (4) developing cooperation, (5) agricultural loans, and (6) agricultural sales.</p>
<p>Handle Loans and Purchase Local Products</p>
<p>We have cooperated with the governments of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces and water conservancy agencies to handle water conservancy loans and production loans, including seeds, fertilizers, and plowing cattle. Currently, 8.3 million yuan of water conservancy loans, 4.87 million yuan of production loans, and 2 million yuan of agricultural product loans have been lent out. 81,000 yuan was allocated for agricultural improvement expenses. As for the purchase of major local products nationwide, we have purchased food, cotton, etc. in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces, with a total value of 10.17 million yuan. In addition, we have held transportation and sales loans in Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, with a total amount of 2.7 million yuan, but only for agricultural products.</p>
<p>Increase Production and Plan Reclamation</p>
<p>It is stipulated to increase food production in the west and cotton production in the southwest. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Last year's cotton production in the southwest increased significantly compared with the previous year. (1) Wheat fields in Shaanxi Province increased by 2 million mu, and production increased by 12 million dan. (2) Sichuan produced 900,000 bundles of cotton, an increase of one time compared with the previous year, and 74,000 mu of cotton fields were promoted. As for the planning and reclamation of Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, reclamation areas have been designated and refugees have been relocated to reclaim wasteland. Regarding agricultural cooperation, it has been actively promoted. Forty-seven cooperative treasuries have been established in various places, distributed in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Agricultural warehouses have been established everywhere to store agricultural products.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Undertakings are Actively Underway</p>
<p>To develop agriculture in the inland, it is best to build water conservancy projects to facilitate irrigation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a central hydraulic laboratory to conduct hydraulic experiments and water conservancy research. Shaanxi Province has the most water conservancy projects. The Mei-Hui Canal has been completed, irrigating 200,000 mu. The Luo-Hui Canal project is also nearing completion, and can irrigate 500,000 mu. The Pai-Hui Canal can irrigate 200,000 mu, and the Hei-Hui Canal can irrigate 100,000 mu. The Tiao-Hui Canal in Gansu has now been completed. The Min-Hui Canal will be completed soon, and each can irrigate tens of thousands of mu. The southwest provinces have also been approved separately. A total of 200,000 mu can be irrigated in Sichuan, 190,000 mu can be irrigated in Guangxi, and 200,000 mu can be irrigated in Hunan.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e3">New Atmosphere on the Front Lines <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>After the exposure of the secret agreement between Wang and Hiranuma, the 'anti-communist' and 'peace' conspiracy plotted by × traitors suffered another major blow. The atmosphere on the front lines of the War of Resistance has also been renewed. What is particularly noteworthy is that our army in the Northwest crossed the Yellow River to attack Jin ×, that our army in Hebei, Chahar, and Jin marched outside the customs to launch the Northeast War of Resistance, that our army in Longhai divided its forces to attack Kaifeng and Xuzhou and severely damaged the × army, that the remaining guerrillas along the Pinghan and Jinpu lines were reactivated, and that guerrilla warfare on a large scale was launched in the border areas of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Especially in South China, our army divided its forces from Zengcheng, Huaxian, Foshan, and other places to create a situation of surrounding Guangzhou. The realization of this strategic advantage can be said to be the new atmosphere seen only in the more than 20 months of the War of Resistance. No wonder the British 'Times', 'Daily Express', 'Daily Telegraph', etc., which are usually known for their rigorous arguments, have also unanimously praised that our country's War of Resistance has already gained an advantage.</p>
<p>We must recognize that the main reason why this new atmosphere has been discovered on the front lines of the War of Resistance is that our entire nation and soldiers unanimously support the government's most steadfast leader's spirit of resolutely fighting to the end, that is due to the strong unity of all ethnic groups, parties, and strata of our country, is due to our great progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and diplomacy, and also due to the growth of the international democratic and peaceful anti-aggression front and the sympathy and assistance of the whole world for our War of Resistance. If we can accurately recognize these main reasons, we can further maintain and develop these main reasons, then a more optimistic new atmosphere will be discovered on the front lines of the War of Resistance until the final victory is realized.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we must also be clear that these new atmospheres on the front lines of the War of Resistance are not a sign that we have already entered the 'strategic counter-offensive stage', but only a necessary step for the War of Resistance to shift from the first stage of defense to the second stage of stalemate. Because we know that the × people are trying to take advantage of the progress of the German and Italian aggressors in Europe and the difficult situation of Britain and France to step up their military speculative and adventurous steps in the Far East, in order to consolidate their occupied areas, establish a unified and strong puppet regime, and then use the 'anti-communist' and 'peace' movements as an auxiliary to complete the plan to subdue the entire China. The widespread offensive currently launched on the front lines of our War of Resistance is to break this plan of the × people, prevent the offensive of the × people, and then increase the difficulties of the × people, weaken the combat effectiveness of the × people, promote the realization of the stalemate stage, and prepare for the execution of the war of resistance and counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Based on this new understanding of the current War of Resistance, at least it should be clear that: to adapt to this new atmosphere that has already been realized, we must maintain and develop this new atmosphere, that is, we must quickly and effectively enhance the combat power of our front lines, widely develop guerrilla warfare behind the × lines, and at the same time step up the cultivation of new forces in the rear and promote all preparations for strategic counter-offensive. This is the overall task of our entire nation's current War of Resistance. In order to smoothly complete this task, everyone must do their best to maintain those essential reasons for the victory of the War of Resistance mentioned above. We must effectively implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence. We must strive to eliminate traitors and eliminate traitorous remarks and actions such as 'anti-communism' and 'peace', and support persevering in the War of Resistance and striving for final victory and true peace. We must consolidate and expand the national united anti-Japanese front and the international anti-aggression peace front, in order to concentrate the strength of the entire nation and concentrate more and greater foreign aid. And when the new atmosphere is initially presented on the front lines, our entire nation, especially overseas Chinese, in addition to the above-mentioned tasks, must also be doubly enthusiastic to return to the country and serve their hometowns, must also be doubly enthusiastic to donate money and goods to relieve refugees, and must also redouble their efforts in propaganda and mobilization work to win international sympathy and assistance for me. The new atmosphere on the front lines has illuminated our great road of struggle with the glory of victory!</p>
<h3 id="e4">A Meeting with General Zhang Fakui and Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>Friends of China in China (8)</p>
<p>In the early morning of the 19th, Li Meng and I returned from a teahouse after 'drinking tea'. He expressed great appreciation for many sweet pastries. Just as we stepped into the entrance of the hostel, the waiter told me that Commander-in-Chief Zhang's headquarters had called. However, he did not know who called and what they said. In order to visit Mr. Zhang Xianghua, the 'Iron General' who came to Guangzhou to take charge, I called the headquarters. Unexpectedly, General Zhang himself answered the phone. Therefore, I expressed my intention to him and made an appointment for the meeting time. He said that he was busy with a meeting now and would send someone to pick us up at twelve o'clock. With this appointment, we sat patiently waiting for the clock to strike twelve!</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, someone knocked on the door. The person who came in was a very capable-looking officer with a few short mustaches on his upper lip. After exchanging business cards with each other, it turned out that he was Section Chief Liang from the Adjutant's Office. At the invitation of the local, we arrived at the reception room of the headquarters. As soon as we sat down, a tall and large hunting dog ran out of the room inside. It sniffed everyone's feet, and then lay down very gently next to us. It seemed to be telling us that the host was about to come out. At this time, the surrounding air seemed to suddenly tense up, and there was silence. After a while, Mr. Zhang came out of the side door with a smile. He was not tall, and had a thin figure, with the 'short and capable' characteristics of the average Cantonese person, just like what Brother Xia Yan said; The tiger general who was famous in the Northern Expedition, the founder of the Fourth Army of the "Chinese Iron Army," the commander, the ×× commander-in-chief, and the general of the team army… From these reputations, experiences, and positions, I mysteriously associated with a General Zhang Huanhou-style with a leopard forehead and curly beard. However, when he appeared in front of us, and shook our hands diligently and enthusiastically, he was an intellectual class person with a figure similar to ours and a pair of kind and often smiling eyes. Moreover, it is said that he also likes to play tennis and swim... lively with the demeanor of a college student. When speaking, the two small mustaches kept moving on both sides, adding a lot of gentle ingredients. When Li Meng asked about the military situation in Guangdong, he said, "I have not been here for a long time, so what I know is only a general situation. All the detailed situations can be asked to Deputy Commander Yu in the future. He is naturally more familiar than me." This humble and amiable expression made us constantly fortunate for the future of Guangdong. The lessons of Guangzhou in the past; tell us that personnel coordination is absolutely sufficient to improve work efficiency. Then, Mr. Xianghua said, "There are a total of ninety-seven counties in Guangdong. The area occupied by the × people is only a few county towns and a few large towns. This is also the biggest weakness of the × people. In a country like China with such a vast land and so many people, he has no power to go further and deeper. Moreover, since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of guerrillas in Guangdong has increased rapidly, and there have been many facts of people automatically rising up to kill ×. As of now, it can be said that there is a stalemate between × and me. There are no major battles on the lines, but only small contacts. The cooperation between the guerrillas and the regular army has also become more closely. Now the power of the × people in Guangdong is also very weak, with a total of only about six or seventy thousand people."; Is there a possibility of a major battle in Guangdong in the near future! Mrs. Li Meng asked curiously, "Of course there is a possibility. In my opinion, there are only two ways to go here, one is the offensive of the × people, and the other is our counter-offensive. Both of these developments are enough to cause major battles." Of course, the possibility of the former is greater than that of the latter. Our counter-offensive force is still being cultivated, and the timing of the counter-offensive is not yet ripe. Moreover, if the counter-offensive is started, it must be a national strategic issue rather than a separate action in Guangdong. Finally, General Zhang said, "Due to a understanding I have gained from participating in the war in the past year, I firmly believe that the final victory will definitely be ours. The facts have now told us that the × people are not good at mountain warfare. In Shanghai, the ratio of casualties between × and me was probably one to four. We died four people and the × people died one person. By the time of the Battle of the Longhai Road, the ratio had become three to one, and we could die one person less than before. As for the Battle of Jiujiang, the contrast in mortality has become two to one, and now it will slowly reach equality. After that, the area of operation will mostly be mountainous areas, and transportation will be extremely inconvenient, and action will naturally become difficult. In our case, we can save a lot of ammunition due to the inconvenience of the terrain; the × people will have a lot of new difficulties. What's more, our army is getting stronger and stronger, and the morale is getting stronger and stronger. The guerrilla areas behind the × people are also growing. Naturally, these many situations can make a foreign friend who sympathizes with China optimistic about the future of the war and can deeply believe that we will definitely win. At the same time, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to friends who have come from afar and hope that you will expose the atrocities of fascist Japan in China to the international community, so that everyone can understand that China has already had many conditions for sure victory." This solid sentence containing infinite energy expresses what kind of awesome figure this famous general who has fought on the battlefield for a long time is. While mutually hoping that the relationship between China and France will not be improved and that the people of China and France will strengthen their unity, we nodded goodbye to Mr. Zhang, who was standing at the gate of the camp.</p>

<p>The Recaptured Huangchuan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huangchuan Telegram, 16th] A reporter set out from a certain place in northern Hubei at the beginning of the month, broke through the enemy's cordon, crossed the Pinghan Railway at a certain place, and arrived in southeastern Hubei. After seven days of arduous travel, he arrived safely in the Huangchuan County seat, which had been recaptured. Huangchuan had fallen into enemy hands in September of last year, lasting seventy days. It was recaptured by a certain guerrilla detachment of a certain war zone of ours. When the enemy retreated, they left behind many corpses and military supplies. After our troops entered the city, it took many days to bury all the bodies. Efforts have been made to restore order, comfort refugees, reorganize the Baojia system, train young men, and eliminate traitors. The results are very good. Currently, half of the city's residents have returned, and the market is recovering to its pre-war state. Today, the reporter observed piles of broken tiles on the streets of the north and south cities. Although there are signs of recovery, the sight of broken walls and ruins is everywhere. In the villages within a few miles of the city, there are dangerous walls and bullet holes like beehives. The general population, having suffered such a great trauma, hates the enemy even more and is united in resisting aggression. The military and civilians are cooperating closely, waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy, causing them to be overwhelmed.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Battle of Mabu Dashan (Report) <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>[Special Report] On March 23, 1939, the ×××th Division, defending our Chen Di north of the Miluo River, under the command of General Zhang ×× of the ×××th Army, was ordered to attack from the Xinqiang River. The task was to feign an attack on three enemy strongholds on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway: Guozhen City in the front, Matang Railway Station on the left flank, and Xinkaitang on the right flank, in order to contain the enemy troops fiercely attacking Nanchang in northern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of November of the previous year, the enemy troops in Yueyang, Quan and Xianning had only left a small number of troops—including recruits and puppet troops—to garrison after rushing to build stronghold fortifications. The enemy troops in Yueyang were under the banner of the 9th Division, while those in Puqi and Qi Ning were under the 6th Division. They knew that they were facing Guan's troops, who had made them tremble in Lunan and Ruichang. Therefore, even when they were in groups in the nearby countryside during the day, robbing homes and looting, they would hide in the strongholds surrounded by two layers of barbed wire at night to prevent sudden attacks by guerrilla troops.</p>
<p>Cheng Jiahuang, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the ×××th Regiment, led the fighting soldiers of his battalion from the camp near the Xinqiang River. He had shed blood twice for the national revolution during the Northern Expedition and had been wounded in Shanghai, Lunan, and Ruichang since the "August 13th" Incident. Years of life in the battlefield had made this strong man from central Hubei as strong as iron. The khaki woolen uniform had been on him for two winters, but he still wore it as neatly as new. His purplish-brown square face and majestic round eyes made the brothers feel that he was respectable and awe-inspiring. He was particularly kind when talking to the old people and always said that China would definitely have a way under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, which made the old people and the brothers feel that he was kind and lovely.</p>
<p>For five months, they had gone through snow-covered mountains to fields full of yellow flowers, going in and out of the mountains east of the abandoned base of the Yuehan Railway. Now, Battalion Commander Cheng and his subordinates were even more familiar with the area than returning to their hometowns. They felt as close to those peaceful villages, some of which had been dilapidated and some of which were still being built, as they did to their own homes. Once, they watched the enemy dismantle the beams and pillars of those villages on the mountain to build fortifications. Several brothers were so angry that they gnashed their teeth and stamped their feet, demanding to rush down and kill them all. He comforted them, saying, "There will be that day. I will be ordered to kill them with you."</p>
<p>The mountains and fields of Hunan are as lovely as the farmers of Hunan. The yellow soil hills sometimes reveal ochre-black boulders. The young pine forests and the seemingly countless layers of terraced fields seem to be saying to everyone, "This is one of the guarantees for the inevitable success of national construction." These days, it has been raining from time to time. The fields are full of water, pouring out in layers towards the lower ground. On the hillside, farmers wrapped in black headscarves are walking with oxen in the mud. Hearing the rustling sound from the foot of the mountain, they pull the ox rope with one hand and shield the sun above their heads with the other, looking down. The flashing bayonets and the flower-patterned single-file column reflected in the paddy fields. He watched them with a smile until the last one. He realized that these brothers were going to fight the enemy, and perhaps his own brothers were among them.</p>
<p>The door of a farmer's house by the roadside is open. Enemy soldiers often appear in this area, and women and children cannot let them see their faces. They all go to secluded mountain recesses. Adults work in the fields, and the elderly sit守 at home, not opening the door unless they see their own army. When the point man passes through their fields, they know that the follow-up troops will arrive soon. They quickly burn pine firewood to boil water, fill a large bucket, and wait at the intersection with a few rough bowls. If they need to camp, they move the precious fodder into the house for the animals and insist on letting the officers sleep in their own beds.</p>
<p>Bypassing Yingzui Mountain and taking the road through Shachong, the team goes from west of Dashan, around the right side of Mabu Dashan, to the right front. This mountain, at an elevation of 380.5 meters, is located between Xinkaitang and Matang Railway Station, and only 15 li from Guozhen City. The advance troops made contact with the enemy's guarding troops. Bullets burst out with a clear sound, and then each trailed a bee-like tail,划 over the sky. Our imposing aura tightly compressed the enemy, forcing them to溃 scattered, leaving behind the pitiful corpses of the "Imperial Army" and fleeing north. A part of us detoured northeast near Taohuadong, destroying the bridge near Maolipu between Xinkaitang and Guozhen City. Most of us continued to advance northwest.</p>

<p>[Shaoguan Express News] Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, believes that at this critical time of the anti-war effort, the organization and training of anti-Japanese self-defense corps in various counties and cities in the province is extremely urgent. In order to improve the quality of the teams and enrich the strength of the anti-war effort, he has specifically ordered the administrative inspectors of each district to urge the city and bureau chiefs under their jurisdiction to quickly send personnel to the gathering places of each team to verify the number of personnel. If the number of personnel is insufficient, they should be given a deadline to make up the full quota. Those who submit false reports or embezzle food supplies shall be punished. As for the captains of each county, if they are indeed incompetent, the city and bureau chiefs shall order a re-election. Team members who are old or weak, or whose guns are inferior, shall be immediately sent back and replaced with strong men with good guns. If ammunition is lacking, they may submit a request to be verified and issued accordingly. After the verification of the gathered teams is completed, they shall continue to work with the district and township chiefs to verify and conduct general training of the teams, weeding out the weak and retaining the strong. If the number of personnel is insufficient, they shall be ordered to supplement or merge them. If there are still good guns hidden in the countryside that have not been incorporated, they should be made to join teams with vacancies. If there are no vacancies in nearby teams, then a new team should be formed, and according to the number of people and guns, they should be formed into squads or platoons, belonging to the nearby large company. If some people are not fully aware of the meaning of organizing self-defense, they should first be given sincere劝导 to make them voluntarily join. Those who do not listen shall be given a warning by the district and township chiefs and ordered to join.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York Telegram, 15th] Insurance companies here recently announced that wartime insurance has been suspended for all goods transported to or from Germany and Italy. It is said that this is because the hard-line naval policy pursued by various democratic countries in the Mediterranean has led to a sudden increase in tensions. In addition, the insurance fee for goods transported to China through the Suez Canal has increased from 62.5 cents per $100 to $1.25 per $100, the highest rate ever.</p>

<p>— Tang Shi</p>
<p>Continued from yesterday</p>
<p>3. Youth Groups</p>
<p>The situation encountered by the youth groups is similar to that of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Corps, but the losses after the withdrawal from Guangzhou were heavier. Now there are only about 30 people left, some of whom are participating in the work of the Qujiang County Party Headquarters, and some of whom are participating in the work of the Provincial Party Headquarters. The focus of work is 重民衆 schools.</p>
<p>4. New Sports Association Women's Working Committee</p>
<p>The women's movement after the fall of Guangzhou was very dull for a period of time. Recently, Mrs. Wu Jufang, the wife of Chairman Li, initiated the organization of a women's training class to train women cadres, who will be assigned to various places to be responsible for carrying out the women's movement and re-establish it. Note: The national women's working committee is led by Mrs. Chiang, and each province is presided over by the wife of the provincial chairman.</p>
<p>5. 4th War Zone Political Work Brigade</p>
<p>This brigade has not been in Qujiang for long. In the past, it has always worked as a traffic and communication officer and troop worker with the political department. The main task is to bring the masses and the army closer together and to create military-civilian cooperation through organization, training, and education. After coming to Qujiang, in addition to the general oral and written propaganda, they also founded several mass night schools and compiled mass textbooks according to the local situation.</p>
<p>6. Military Commission Fifth Political Work Brigade</p>
<p>This team is肾 staying in Qujiang and is expected to go to Xijiang in the future to assume political training work in the army. They previously worked in Shixing, Wengyuan and other places. The Military Commission once had a first performance brigade come to Qujiang and performed several national defense plays, which were widely welcomed by the public. Their fundraising tickets were snapped up by everyone, because many of the members had considerable experience in the theater world, such as Zhao Dan.</p>
<p>7. Provincial Relief Committee First Brigade</p>
<p>This is a famous rescue team in the province. They have previously worked on the front lines of Shi'an Zengcheng and are now temporarily in Qujiang and will return to the front lines. People in society admire them very much.</p>
<p>8. Social Service Office</p>
<p>The Social Service Office is sponsored by the Provincial Party Headquarters and is a semi-group, semi-institutional organization. The purpose is to serve society and establish good relations with the masses. It has mass schools, mass inquiry offices, and job introduction offices. If compatriots who are "new to the area" have any difficulties, they can try their best to help solve them.</p>
<p>In addition, the Security Political Brigade and the County People's Education Center are both for mass education and propaganda. The People's Education Center has　 reporting offices, mass weekly meetings, current affairs forums, and literacy classes.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the political work team of the Central Movement Committee, which was transferred back from Xijiang, selected about 100 people and concentrated them in the county middle school for training. The training is presided over by the Fourth War Zone Command and will last for three weeks before being assigned to various guerrilla areas. In the second stage, the importance of this work is self-evident. It is hoped that the authorities will continue to train them in batches and transport them in large quantities to the occupied areas. After the enemy arrives, they will launch containment, harassment,　 attacks, and annihilation of enemy guerrilla warfare, and should pay special attention to organizing the masses in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief introduction to the situation of the various salvation groups here. Because the reporter passed through Qujiang and stayed for two days, it was a fleeting glimpse. There must be many details that are not clear. It is hoped that each community will often report the situation of activities, exchange observations, and encourage each other to promote progress towards the bright road of anti-war national construction!</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Establishment of the Balance Fund Committee Makes Our Finance More Stable; Rogers Will Go to Chongqing to Meet with Our Authorities; Our New Loan from Britain Should Be Successful <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) Our government, in order to stabilize foreign exchange and enrich the wartime economy, previously held credit loans from Britain and the United States to stabilize the foreign exchange fund, with a loan of 25 million yuan to the United States and a loan of 10 million pounds to Britain. The British loan is guaranteed by the British government and paid by the British bank. The method of disbursement is that HSBC Bank accounts for 3 million pounds, Standard Chartered Bank accounts for 2 million pounds, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications account for a total of 5 million pounds. This loan has been successfully completed. The Central and British countries have set up a balance foreign exchange fund committee to manage everything. The members of the committee are Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, Carey of HSBC Bank, Jin Bizhi of the Standard Chartered Bank, and British financial expert Rogers. The balance foreign exchange fund committee office was established in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Successful Loans and Stable Finance</p>
<p>After Rogers was appointed as a member of the committee, on the 2nd of this month, he accompanied his wife from Britain by Imperial Airways plane to Hong Kong, arriving at the port on the evening of the 8th, staying at the Repulse Bay Hotel. Rogers came to China this time with the task of reorganizing Chinese finance. When Rogers left the UK to come to the East, he had several meetings with Sir Leith-Ross, who had been sent to China to help reorganize the monetary system, to discuss the reorganization and implementation of Chinese gold coins in detail. As for the content, it involves the entire financial plan and cannot be published in Hong Kong. With the success of China's loan to Britain and the United States this time, and the joint reorganization by China and Britain, the consolidation of China's wartime finance will inevitably be a reality. Recently, the Chinese government has again borrowed 3 million pounds from the British side and is currently in discussion, which is believed to be successful. It is just around the corner. With this support, China's finance will be more enriched. Even if there are disputes in the international community, the financial turmoil will not affect and shake Chinese finance. In addition, Rogers, after arriving in Hong Kong, also conducted an investigation and observation of the financial situation in Hong Kong and met with the local authorities to briefly discuss the general situation. He will stay in Hong Kong for a considerable amount of time before leaving Hong Kong to go to Chongqing to meet with our highest authorities, and then return to Hong Kong. The trip is scheduled to return to the UK in four months to report to the British authorities on the situation, and then come to the East again.</p>

<p>Smooth Progress in Anglo-Franco-Soviet Talks: Designated Outcome Expected, Strengthening Baltic Guarantees [Reuters, Moscow, 16th]</p>
<p>It is learned that since French Foreign Minister Bonnet and the Soviet Ambassador to France held a meeting in Paris tonight, negotiations regarding inviting the Soviet Union to participate in mutual assistance are proceeding satisfactorily. It is reported that methods to resolve several aspects have been found, and a designated outcome is expected by Sunday. These negotiations are apparently not limited to aviation measures; it is also rumored to concern the supply of various munitions and raw materials to Poland and Romania in wartime.</p>
<p>[London, 15th]</p>
<p>Europe is experiencing a quiet weekend with no startling or unexpected events. However, it would be a mistake to interpret this silence as a sign of peace, as democracies and Axis powers are engaged in intense diplomatic maneuvering and covert activities to consolidate their respective positions. These activities can be broadly categorized into four areas: (1) Germany and Italy: Göring is currently in Rome discussing matters with Mussolini; (2) Yugoslavia and Bulgaria: While the content of their discussions remains undisclosed, it is reported that the Yugoslav envoy to Bulgaria has departed for Belgrade after lengthy discussions with the Bulgarian Prime Minister (Note: The actions of these two countries are noteworthy, as Yugoslavia's stance has remained ambiguous since Italy's invasion of Albania, significantly impacting the Balkan front); (3) Poland and Greece: Polish Foreign Minister Beck met separately today with the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, and Italy, as well as the envoys of Romania and Turkey; (4) The Backbone of the Democratic Front—Britain and France: The Anglo-Soviet talks regarding an air force assistance alliance are drawing the most attention. After British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Soviet Ambassador Maisky held discussions, instructions were issued to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to continue discussions with Litvinov. Both London and Paris acknowledge new developments in the negotiations with the Soviet Union, with the French Foreign Ministry expressing extreme optimism. Simultaneously, there is consideration of inviting Turkey to join the anti-aggression front. Since Britain declared its guarantee of Romania, newspapers have paid particular attention to the actions of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu. Following his visit to Berlin this month, Gafencu is scheduled to visit Brussels on April 21st. The British side has already expressed its welcome to Gafencu's potential visit to Britain. While no formal invitation has been extended yet, there are numerous issues awaiting discussion between Britain and Romania. If Gafencu could visit Britain after Brussels, it would provide an opportunity to exchange views.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th]</p>
<p>The proposed Soviet-Polish-Romanian air force cooperation plan has become the focus of British press commentary on Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Diplomatic circles believe this policy is feasible. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Manchester Guardian" stated that, according to informed sources, the agreement sought by Britain and the Soviet Union would fall between existing Anglo-Soviet relations and the Anglo-Polish agreement. In other words, it would surpass existing Anglo-Soviet relations but not reach the comprehensiveness of the Anglo-Polish agreement. In the event of war, both Poland and Romania must be considered, and their supply lines must be protected. Informed diplomatic sources share this view and recognize that the current objective of Anglo-Soviet negotiations is to lay the foundation for a series of future agreements, ensuring that Poland and Romania receive adequate supplies of raw materials and munitions in the event of war. British and French newspapers are predicting cooperation between their respective air forces, with some reports suggesting that the Soviet Union will supply aircraft to the Baltic states. According to informed sources, another crucial point in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is the unrestricted passage of British warships through the Dardanelles Strait in wartime, thereby safeguarding the transport of supplies to Romania.</p>

<p>Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih Visits U.S. State Department [Reuters, Washington, 15th]</p>
<p>Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih visited the State Department today. It is reported that he inquired about China's exclusion from the list of countries whose integrity President Roosevelt intended to protect. Mr. Hu received a favorable response, but the details remain undisclosed.</p>
<p>A Brief Commentary on Roosevelt's Ironic Tone</p>
<p>Amidst the escalating international crisis, U.S. President Roosevelt abruptly issued a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini on the 15th, proposing a minimum guarantee of non-aggression for ten or twenty-five years, followed by discussions on disarmament and trade routes. To the Chinese, this news is reminiscent of the story from the Chu-Han contention era, where the Chu Hegemon Xiang Yu requested a personal duel with Liu Bang to pacify the world. We find President Roosevelt's "boldness" quite admirable, but the reality is that even yielding territory was ridiculed as "battling wits." How much more so the likes of Hitler and Mussolini, who are far inferior to Liu Bang!</p>
<p>However, we must recognize that the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement in the United States has made significant progress recently. Meanwhile, certain stubborn reactionary elements, as well as the hired hands of financial capital and a handful of arms and raw material owners who collude with Hitler, are fiercely opposing the democratic peace front. Therefore, Roosevelt's "appeal" is, in fact, not just a mockery of Hitler and Mussolini, but also an ironic jab at Britain and France, as well as the reactionary and stubborn elements within his own country. Or perhaps, it can be hailed as "Roosevelt's humor!"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the followers of Hitler and Mussolini are fundamentally executioners of human culture. Offering them musical entertainment, humor, or even genuine appeals for peace is unlikely to have any practical effect, except to further expose their sinister image. Even if this "peace appeal" is disguised as a bribe to alleviate Germany and Italy's economic difficulties, it will only embolden their future acts of recklessness, posing a greater threat to world peace. It is time to abandon all illusions of "peace through non-resistance!" The path of effectively sanctioning aggressors and promoting collective security urgently needs to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Italian Military Threatens Gibraltar, Mediterranean Tensions Escalate: Britain and Greece Adopt Defensive Measures, German and Italian Troops in Spain Remain Deployed [London, 15th]</p>
<p>British military authorities are deeply concerned about the growing threat to British interests at both ends of the Mediterranean, a threat apparently instigated by Italy. The increased military activity near Gibraltar has prompted British authorities to take defensive measures. The official announcement from Burgos postponing Franco's triumphant entry into Madrid has raised significant concerns among British authorities. The date of Franco's entry into Madrid marks the beginning of the withdrawal of Italian troops stationed in Spain. In other words, the postponement of Franco's entry also means that Italian troops are unwilling to withdraw during this critical period. According to the diplomatic correspondent of "The Daily Telegraph," the British government views the threat to British interests in Egypt with no less importance than that to Gibraltar. Senior members of the British General Staff have held numerous meetings at the White House to meticulously study recent troop movements and draft military plans to defend both locations as needed. Over the past week, British troops have been continuously deployed from Palestine to Egypt. The postponement of Franco's entry into Madrid is ostensibly due to the anniversary of Madrid's patron saint, which coincides with the original date, necessitating a change. The Italian side claims this is merely a coincidence. However, sources in Burgos state that Italian troops participating in the Spanish war must participate in the victory parade; "Spanish and Italian troops will not withdraw from Spanish territory until late May." As for the withdrawal date of German troops stationed in Spain, it has yet to be announced. It is claimed that "due to Spain's inconvenient transportation," their withdrawal will require considerable time. Spanish Nationalist Commander Lano will review troops in Seville on Sunday, with a total of 40,000 troops fully armed.</p>
<p>[London, 15th]</p>
<p>The military situation in the Mediterranean has further intensified. It is reported that Italian troops have again increased along the Egyptian-Libyan border. Under these alarming Italian deployments, Gibraltar has practically become a war zone. According to a Reuters report from Athens, activity is high in the Italian Dodecanese Islands. Italian troops, weaponry, and supplies have been heavily concentrated in Leros, Rhodes, and Kalymnos. In light of the tense international situation, the Greek government has taken all precautionary measures. A Greek troop contingent has been dispatched to garrison Chios. Additionally, troops have been transferred from Nafplio, Kalamata, and Corinth to the Albanian border. It is also rumored that Greek authorities have drafted a decree to mobilize twelve classes of reservists if necessary. Six torpedo boats have been dispatched to patrol Crete, and approximately forty merchant ships have been requisitioned by the government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 15th]</p>
<p>It has been reliably learned that several electrical teams near Gibraltar began moving westward this morning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 16th]</p>
<p>Local officials have announced that a squadron of British aircraft, approximately 20 to 30 planes, has arrived at Tatoi Air Base, located thirty miles from Athens. Greek aviation officials stated that the British aircraft are here to prepare for potential emergencies.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 16th]</p>
<p>British authorities have laid mines along the road from Spain to Gibraltar and at the entrance to Gibraltar to complete defensive blockades. Officials stated that this is a normal measure for extraordinary times. The Welsh Guards will arrive here from England on the 22nd of this month, and barracks have been prepared for their use.</p>

<p>Local News: World Situation Intensifies, Food and Fuel Prices Soar in Hong Kong; Countries Compete to Store Grain, Rice Shipments from Siam and Vietnam Decrease, Prices Increase; Firewood and Vegetables Prices Skyrocket Due to Merchant Manipulation, Poor Suffer</p>
<p>Hong Kong, being a small, isolated island, relies entirely on external sources for food and fuel. In recent years, due to the impact of war, not only has the supply been disrupted, but the increase in population has also led to increased consumption. Prices have reached levels unprecedented since Hong Kong's opening, and there are concerns about potential shortages. Since the Jiangmen conflict, the sole transportation route between Hong Kong and the mainland has been blocked, causing the prices of daily necessities such as vegetables, fresh fish, and firewood to soar. Recently, with the intensifying world situation, countries have significantly increased their grain stockpiles, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to monopolize, leading to price increases across the board. To understand the recent food situation, our reporter conducted investigations in various areas, the findings of which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Countries Stockpile Grain, Rice Prices Surge</p>
<p>Hong Kong's rice supply has traditionally relied on imports from Annam, Siam, and Rangoon. However, with the intensifying international situation, countries are paying close attention to grain stockpiling to prepare for potential emergencies. Consequently, they have been placing orders with Siam, resulting in fewer rice shipments to Hong Kong and a slight increase in rice prices compared to last week. According to investigations, top-grade rice is selling for HK$8.20 per picul, while lower-grade rice costs HK$6.20 to HK$6.30. Rice merchants report that the recent continuous rise in rice prices is primarily due to purchases from various countries, followed by merchants from various districts in Hong Kong purchasing rice to transport back to their hometowns, driving up prices. Based on current observations, rice prices in Hong Kong are likely to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Merchants Manipulate Firewood Prices, Making It as Expensive as Cinnamon</p>
<p>Regarding firewood, after the fall of Guangzhou, firewood from the Three Rivers (West River, East River, North River) could not be transported to Hong Kong, causing prices to skyrocket and a severe firewood shortage. Subsequently, the Hong Kong authorities negotiated with firewood merchants to find a solution. Recently, there have been rumors that Hong Kong firewood merchants are taking advantage of the fall of Jiangmen to raise prices. Investigations reveal that Hong Kong's firewood supply now relies on imports from Singapore, Sandakan, Guangzhou Bay, and Shantou, which have been continuous. However, due to the long sea routes from various locations, high freight costs, and labor charges, the cost is higher. This is further exacerbated by merchant manipulation and the impact of war, which is not a factual account. In the past two days, 40,000 to 50,000 piculs of firewood have been shipped from Sandakan and Singapore. However, retail prices at firewood stores are around 45 to 50 catties per dollar, causing hardship for the poor.</p>
<p>Vegetable Supply Uninterrupted</p>
<p>As for the vegetable supply, it traditionally comes from Jiangmen, Shiqi, and various locations in Hong Kong such as Aberdeen, Pok Fu Lam, Shau Kei Wan, Kowloon, and the New Territories. With the recent fall of Jiangmen and Xinhui, vegetable prices in Hong Kong have subsequently increased. However, according to vegetable merchants, the supply of fruits and vegetables from Jiangmen and Shiqi has not only remained uninterrupted but has even increased. Yesterday, 70 to 80 baskets of tomatoes, horse beans, scallions, and other items were transported from Bao'an, while cabbage and bok choy from Shiqi and Shantou were particularly abundant. Wholesale vegetable markets in Sai Wan are piled high with fruits and vegetables, creating an impression of plenty. However, merchants and hawkers are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, causing significant increases in retail prices.</p>
<p>Fresh Fish Prices Remain Stable</p>
<p>As for fresh fish, it is generally divided into two types: (1) Freshwater fish, mostly from Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Jiujiang, and other places. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the supply from that area has long been cut off. Although Jiangmen and Jiujiang continue to provide some supply to Hong Kong, preventing a complete shortage, the quantity is limited and prices have nearly doubled compared to before. The recent events in Jiangmen have had a considerable impact, but the supply has not yet been cut off. However, the retail prices of large fish and mandarin fish have increased significantly in recent days, reaching HK$0.26 to HK$0.30 per catty. (2) Saltwater fish. Hong Kong is surrounded by the sea and has abundant fish resources throughout the year. Although there have been repeated incidents of X-ships robbing fishing boats in the waters near the Sino-British border in recent years, fishermen, driven by poverty and hunger, risk going to sea to fish in order to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the supply of saltwater fish in Hong Kong has been maintained, preventing a complete shortage. Recently, it is the peak season for production, so prices remain relatively low.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers from the Front Arrive in Hong Kong Today for Medical Treatment: Over 100 People Arrive from Shenzhen</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, our soldiers at the front have inflicted heavy blows on the X, but our brave soldiers have also suffered many injuries. Yesterday morning, Hong Kong suddenly received an urgent message from the front stating that over a hundred wounded soldiers were waiting near Zhangmutou and Shenzhen, requesting urgent dispatch of vehicles for rescue. Various charitable organizations in Hong Kong immediately mobilized to greet them, arriving in Shenzhen at 12:00 noon. However, as they waited until 4:00 PM without any news, the ambulances returned to Hong Kong. According to Shenzhen military authorities, the wounded soldiers may arrive in Hong Kong today for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Heshan Chamber of Commerce Discusses Relief for Orphans in War Zone</p>
<p>With the X troops invading Heshan, the devastation is particularly severe. The Heshan Chamber of Commerce recently dispatched an investigation team consisting of Feng Baolin, Yi Yiwu, and Liu Yuanjiang to Heshan to assess the situation. Yesterday, Feng and others returned to Hong Kong. The Chamber held an important meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday to discuss ways to relieve the suffering of the orphans in the affected area, in addition to Feng's report on the disaster. Attendees included Chairman Hou Shounan, Feng Baolin, Liu Fuwen, Deng Yuzan, and over twenty others. The Chairman announced the opening of the meeting, followed by Feng Baolin's report on the investigation of the Heshan disaster. His report was similar to the county party headquarters' report on the X military's invasion of Heshan. Finally, two major resolutions were passed: (1) to donate 600 raincoats to the county's militia, and (2) to send the former director of the Heshan Orphanage to Heshan to bring all the orphans to Hong Kong and connect with the Wartime Children's Relief Association, planning to relocate them to Shaoguan until 5:00 PM when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Zhang Kunyi Welcomed by Overseas Chinese in the United States: Patriotism of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Kunyi, a special correspondent for this newspaper and the adopted daughter of painting master Gao Qifeng, was warmly received upon her arrival in the United States with her works for the Golden Gate Exhibition to promote national art. Various organizations held meetings to welcome her. Among the organizations was the Longgang Liangyi General Association, named after the brotherhood of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Zhao. The day after Ms. Zhang's arrival, which coincided with the birthday of Liu Bei, she was specially invited to participate in the celebrations, where she spoke about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's story, and several staff members were appointed to assist Ms. Zhang. They were responsible for resolving any issues related to national crises on her behalf. In addition, overseas Chinese throughout the city enthusiastically contributed whenever the government sent representatives to solicit donations. Counterfeit national goods were strictly scrutinized. The patriotism was no less than that of the people in China.</p>
<p>Overseas Vietnamese Scouting Service Corps Leaves Hong Kong Yesterday to Serve at the Front: Hong Kong Gentry Du Qizhang Held Farewell Ceremony</p>
<p>The Overseas Vietnamese Chinese Scouting Service Corps, a group of seventy-four people, recently returned to China and arrived in Hong Kong. The public gave them a warm welcome, as reported in previous issues. The Corps departed for the country yesterday on the SS Harris to serve the nation. Mr. Du Qizhang, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Yaocheung Middle School in Hong Kong, and Principal Chen Yuanzhao held a farewell ceremony in the school auditorium. Lin Luying, the Corps leader, and Zhang Lupeng, the deputy leader, led over seventy members to the meeting. Principal Chen delivered the opening remarks, followed by Mr. Du Qizhang's address, stating: "At this critical juncture for the survival of our nation and people, we must fulfill our duty to repay our country. You are stationed in Vietnam but are sacrificing everything to urgently return to your homeland. This act will not only inspire overseas Chinese in the South Seas, but the international community will also recognize our people as a great nation who put the country before their families. It will also make the X people realize that our country has unlimited manpower and resources, plunging them into a state of frustration where they cannot fight and cannot make peace. The Corps is rushing to the front to serve the country, and I wish you all the best in your efforts to serve the nation." Lin Luying, the Corps leader, expressed that the overseas Vietnamese have always admired Mr. Du Qizhang and his tireless efforts in the cause of national salvation, which they greatly admire. For example, when the Overseas Chinese Drivers Service Corps was in Hong Kong, they also received Mr. Du's strong support. This time, when the Corps of over seventy members arrived in Hong Kong, they were grateful for Mr. Du's efforts in borrowing the Yaocheung Middle School campus to provide accommodation for the entire Corps. They were also grateful for his assistance in contacting Ms. Liu Qingxuan, Chairwoman of the Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association, who allocated a large number of medicines. As they were about to leave, Mr. Du donated a large number of medicines. This would not only be remembered by the entire Corps but also benefit the wounded soldiers at the front. The Corps boarded the SS Harris yesterday to serve the country at the front.</p>
<p>Defend Chao-Shan, Consolidate South China! The New Situation in Chao-Shan</p>
<p>Mr. Xia Yan's Speech at the Chao-Shan Alumni Association by Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>At present, Chao-Shan is China's only seaport, and it is a new major transportation artery. Understanding and defending Chao-Shan is undoubtedly a pressing task in supporting the war of resistance. For the sake of national interests and hometown ties, overseas Chao-Shan natives are naturally more concerned. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Hong Kong Chao-Shan Alumni Association specially invited Mr. Xia Yan, a renowned writer and editor-in-chief of the Jiuwang Daily who recently arrived in Hong Kong via Chao-Shan, to give a speech on "The New Situation in Chao-Shan" at Jian Dao Guangzhong School. Needless to say, this was a meaningful discussion.</p>
<p>Seventy to eighty enthusiastic members of the Chao-Shan Alumni Association and guests filled a spacious classroom. The amiable and enthusiastic Mr. Xia began his report amidst warm applause, recounting his inspection of Chao-Shan from Shaoguan.</p>
<p>Chao-Shan is a part of the larger Guangdong province, so Mr. Xia began by discussing the new situation in Guangdong as a whole.</p>
<p>For a period of time after the fall of Guangzhou, morale and public sentiment were somewhat shaken, and a sense of frustration weighed on the minds of many short-sighted individuals. However, since the appointment of Generals Zhang Fakui, Li Hanun, and Yu Hanmou at the end of the year, and with their diligent efforts, the situation has indeed seen a significant turnaround for the better. In the military sphere, General Zhang Fakui has unified military commands and built upon past successes, making the prospect of counter-attacking Guangzhou optimistic. The allocation of military commanders and forces in the East, West, and North Rivers is also sufficient to strike the X people.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, Mr. Xia has had two long conversations with Chairman Li, and Chairman Li has indeed demonstrated the determination and perseverance to create a clean government. "Make Guangdong politics like Guangxi" is what Chairman Li has openly stated. Currently, they are focusing on military defense and political offense, training young students to develop political work in the army, and reorganizing and reorganizing guerrilla forces, all of which are actively underway.</p>
<p>Many highways have been destroyed, or partially destroyed, and will be completely destroyed if necessary. According to Mr. Xia's personal inspection, after the destruction of the highways, the X people's mechanized units will be unable to advance through the mountains and marshes. General Bai Chongxi said that the failure of our first phase of the war of resistance was due to insufficient highway destruction, which allowed the X people to advance rapidly. In the future, we must move from a "scorched earth resistance" to a "digging earth resistance." This joke contains a profound truth. Currently, the Guangdong authorities have detailed plans for "digging earth" to destroy the highways, making it very difficult for the X people to attack Shaoguan from Guangzhou or penetrate into Chao'an and Jieyang. Mr. Xia illustrated his experiences with chalk, which deeply interested the entire audience. However, as they listened further, worry and melancholy immediately occupied everyone's minds.</p>
<p>From Xingning to Chao'an, and from Chao'an to Shantou, it became increasingly lively and prosperous. Industrial goods and daily necessities, which were difficult to obtain at high prices in Guilin and Shaoguan, were all readily available. However, many, many of them were originally Japanese goods. The X people's ability to counterfeit brands is quite "advanced." The fact that Chao-Shan serves as a market for X goods is one reason why the X people do not easily blockade Chao-Shan, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>In Jieyang, political work and conscript training are being done well. In Chao'an and Shantou, people are indulging in entertainment, openly smoking, gambling, and prostitution... Everything is far removed from the war of resistance, simply a normal state of affairs. Moreover, because it is the only transportation hub, everything is becoming even more lively and prosperous. Under this thick atmosphere of peace, it goes without saying that a great crisis is lurking. Political awareness in Chao-Shan is severely lacking. The X-X Daily, which is expressly prohibited from import by the central government, is surprisingly circulating in Shantou, using "an example" today and some "statement" tomorrow.</p>
<p>There is no inspection of luggage entering and leaving. A foreigner passing through the area is not questioned. There are no restrictions on draftees or national goods leaving. It is simply a foreign concession, so what is there to talk about resistance—if this situation is not quickly reversed, the tragedies of Huizhou and Guangzhou will befall Chao-Shan. Fortunately, the authorities are paying attention, and the Chao-Mei Garrison Commander, a renowned anti-Japanese general, has firmly expressed his determination to defend Chao'an to the death, which is a powerful force. It is also hoped that the Chao-Shan natives in Hong Kong will create the power of public opinion and quickly overcome the weaknesses of Chao-Shan. Defending Chao-Shan is also consolidating South China.</p>
<p>A burst of warm applause concluded Mr. Yao's speech. Deeply admiring his insightful observations after more than ten days of inspection, overseas Chao-Shan natives, although far from their hometown, still knew some things about their hometown and eagerly asked Mr. Xia questions:</p>
<p>"The general authorities are suppressing the youth's national salvation movement," "political darkness," "rampant corruption," "the tyranny of a scoundrel named Du," "the lack of rigor in personnel appointments," "the abuses of the Baojia system and the conscription system," "the self-defense corps being nominal and ineffective," "the hardships of the people," "the resentment of the youth"... There were simply too many to list, and they spoke with pain! Mr. Xia said that he could report to the authorities in the name of the overseas Chinese, and that General Zhang Fakui and Chairman Li were very democratic and enlightened. Mr. Xia himself could also personally report when he returned to Shaoguan. At around 4:00 PM, Mr. Xia left, and the Chao-Shan Alumni Association continued to discuss how to carry out the urgent task of defending Chao-Shan and consolidating South China.</p>
<p>New Governor's Residence to Be Built in Magazine Gap, Construction to Begin This Autumn</p>
<p>The current Governor's Residence in Hong Kong has been completed for many years, and a portion of it has deteriorated. Last year, the Legislative Council approved the construction of a new residence in Magazine Gap. However, the project was stalled due to funding issues.

<p>Police Oppose Double-Decker Buses, Residents' Association Requests Approval</p>
<p>Regarding the operation of double-decker buses, the Kowloon Residents Association recently resolved at its monthly meeting to petition the Hong Kong government, stating that the current Kowloon bus fleet is insufficient and requesting consideration for the immediate implementation of double-decker buses. It is now heard that the police are still opposing the adoption of these new vehicles, deeming them too heavy. The trees along Nathan Road will gradually be cut down, and before implementation, these trees must be heavily pruned; otherwise, the operation of these double-decker buses will be greatly inconvenienced. The roof of the current Star Ferry pier's parking lot also needs to be raised.</p>

<p>Ship Ticket Prices to Singapore Rise Again, Reaching $240 for Male Passengers</p>
<p>Ship ticket prices to Singapore have recently risen again, with male passenger tickets soaring to between $220 and $240, breaking the previous record of $180 in November and December of last year. It has also been found that in the past two months, most of those going to Singapore to seek a living have been refugees fleeing from Hainan Island. The Hainan Overseas Chinese General Association has negotiated with Taikoo Steamship Company to provide 50 passenger spaces each month, 25 for male passengers and 25 for female passengers, at a price of $105 per ticket, in order to alleviate the burden on the refugees from Hainan Island and prevent exploitation by speculators.</p>
<p>Authorities to Recall Old Nickel Coins Starting Next Month: Large Batch of New Coins Recently Arrived from England</p>
<p>Since implementing the legal tender system, the authorities have issued approximately $1.6 million worth of old one-dime coins. After gradual recall, approximately $1.3 million has been collected, leaving slightly over $300,000 in circulation. It is believed that all coins can be recalled in a short period of time. It is now heard that the authorities will announce the implementation of the recall of old coins starting May 1st and declare them invalid within a certain period of time. The reason for extending the recall period is to facilitate the exchange for merchants. Many new coins have been shipped to Hong Kong and are readily available for exchange. In the latest batch of new coins shipped to Hong Kong, the image of the King of England is slightly larger than before. It is hoped that merchants will not become suspicious, create misunderstandings, or be overly picky when using them.</p>
<p>Banditry Rampant: Armed Robbery Case in Sai Ying Pun</p>
<p>Residential Building on Second Street Robbed by Three Thieves Last Night, Significant Losses Incurred, Cargo Boat Robbed by Gang of Pirates in the Waters of Tung Ku Wan</p>
<p>Banditry has been rampant recently, with robbery cases occurring on both land and sea almost daily. Last night at around 8:00 PM, an armed robbery occurred at a residential building on Second Street in Sai Ying Pun. Three thieves escaped after successfully looting the premises. The victim was identified as a woman named Liang Aisu, 31 years old, and married. Last night at around 8:00 PM, three men forced their way into the building. One of the thieves was armed with a handgun, while the other two were unarmed. They were all around 30 years old and wore black cloth shirts and pants. They appeared extremely fierce. After entering the building, they immediately revealed their weapons and threatened everyone, looting the premises for approximately 20 minutes before escaping with their loot. The victim reported the incident to the No. 7 Police Station, which dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate the scene and notified police stations in all districts to assist in the pursuit. A significant amount of silver and jewelry was stolen, but the exact amount could not be determined due to the chaos after the incident. Furthermore, on the 14th of this month, a cargo boat was robbed clean by 13 pirates in the waters of Tung Ku Wan. The victim, Huang Shou (28 years old), reported the incident in Hong Kong yesterday. He stated that his boat, numbered 750, departed from Tuen Mun in the New Territories on the 14th of this month. The journey was smooth until it sailed to the waters near Tung Ku Wan that night. The people on board were about to sleep when, at around 9:00 PM, a pirate boat carrying 13 pirates, all armed and extremely ferocious, forced its way onto the boat. The pirates first threatened everyone with guns, prohibiting them from making any noise, and confined them to one corner. They then tied them up one by one with hemp ropes before looting the boat, carrying all the contents onto the pirate boat and then fleeing with loud shouts. The stolen goods included field materials, noodles, kerosene, paint, etc. He requested that the case be filed and investigated. The police station on duty immediately notified all districts to pursue the pirates.</p>
<p>Training New Soldiers for the Press: A Record of the Entrance Examination for the Journalism Academy by Luo Xia</p>
<p>Hundreds of Excellent Young People Hurl Themselves into Its Embrace</p>
<p>To strengthen the journalism front and train a large number of new soldiers for the press, the Hong Kong Branch of the China Youth Journalists Association established the China Journalism Academy. To join the ranks of the journalism front and participate in this arduous struggle, hundreds of excellent young men and women hurled themselves into its embrace—the Journalism Academy. Yesterday, after the application deadline, the entrance examination was held. It was such a solemn and tense scene!</p>
<p>Before 1:00 PM, the Zhonghua Middle School on Jian Dao gradually became lively. One by one, the young people coming to take the exam looked up at the list of rooms, happily ran up to the third floor, and quietly sat down in the designated classroom. There was no talking inside; all that could be heard was the "thump-thump" of their hearts beating rapidly. Everyone's faces were interwoven with hope and excitement, like thousands of troops marching swiftly with gagged mouths.</p>
<p>"Ding-ding," the bell rang, and the test proctor entered. The test papers were gently placed in front of the group of young people, one by one. Everyone picked them up as if they were looking at lottery numbers. At the top of the test paper were the words "General Knowledge Test," and below were densely printed lines of faint characters, listing question after question. There were three questions related to newspapers, six questions related to domestic and international politics, six questions related to domestic and international military affairs, two questions related to diplomacy, two questions related to domestic and international geography, five questions related to socioeconomics, fourteen questions related to general knowledge, and finally, five questions requiring simple answers. These covered Chinese and foreign history, geography, politics, economics, and current domestic and international affairs, a total of forty-five questions, all of which were basic knowledge that those aspiring to engage in journalism should possess. Upon receiving these two sheets of densely printed general knowledge questions, everyone eagerly spread them out on their desks and answered them one by one, which generally took two and a half hours to complete.</p>
<p>After everyone took a deep breath, the second bell rang, and the second subject, Chinese language, began. The topics were: 1. The Journalism Industry and the War of Resistance; 2. My Opinions on the Hong Kong Press. The smiling proctor entered and announced that students could choose one of the two topics and were not expected to write on both. A wave of lighthearted laughter broke through the solemn atmosphere, followed by silence, then the sound of pens scratching across paper.</p>
<p>The entrance examination concluded at around 4:00 PM. According to those in charge of the Academy, the establishment of the China Journalism Academy was solely to train a group of hardworking journalism soldiers to participate in practical work. Not to mention that the mainland needed this large group of new soldiers, even the Hong Kong press was in urgent need of these young, hardworking individuals to replenish its ranks. Therefore, the selection of students would be strict and not indiscriminate.</p>
<p>It is said that the list of accepted students will be announced this Thursday and published in major newspapers in Hong Kong. Among the hundreds of young people participating in this entrance examination, only sixty will be admitted. Naturally, many will be unsuccessful and eliminated. However, let us patiently wait for the second term! After all, those who have the will will succeed!</p>

<h3 id="e17">U.S. President Calls for Peace: Suggests to Hitler and Mussolini that They Guarantee No Further Aggression Against Independent Nations; Simultaneously Orders Fleet Back to the Pacific <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Sources here announced today that President Roosevelt has called for peace, addressing Hitler and Mussolini in separate telegrams. In these messages to the two dictators, Roosevelt inquired whether they were genuinely willing to provide guarantees against attacking the following independent nations by force. The telegrams stated in part: "Such guarantees should not only apply to the present but also to the future, to allow for the promotion of lasting peace. If we broaden our scope, I would explain to you what constitutes the 'future' in the world. A guarantee against aggression should be for a minimum of ten or twenty-five years. If such guarantees are agreed upon by your governments, I will immediately relay them to other governments, inquiring whether they agree to provide the same guarantee." Roosevelt then listed Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iran, Holland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, and Portugal. Roosevelt stated that he would act as a friendly intermediary to convey peace guarantees, and if mutual guarantees of peace were provided, all nations could engage in negotiations, disarmament, and opening trade routes. The President emphatically stated the general fear of war amongst the world's nations, adding that the existence of such fear is absolutely relevant to the American people, and that any large-scale war, even if confined to another continent, would inevitably have serious impacts on the Americas and extend for generations. He concluded, "For the past several weeks, the world has been in a state of anxious tension, but fortunately, there has been no military action. Therefore, the world should at least have a moment's respite. I believe this is an excellent opportunity for me to convey my humble thoughts to you."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The list of independent nations in President Roosevelt's telegram to the dictators did not include Danzig. In light of reports from Berlin that Hitler may seize Danzig next week, this is extremely significant. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Moscow, Kirk, has been ordered to Berlin to replace the late Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Gilbert. U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Wilson, is unlikely to return to his post until U.S.-German relations improve. Although President Roosevelt's telegram did not mention Czechoslovakia, Austria, Albania, and Abyssinia, which have already been annexed, this does not indicate diplomatic recognition of the conquest of these territories.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] This morning, President Roosevelt convened a special meeting of diplomatic advisors. Those attending the White House meeting included Senator Thurman, Secretary of State Hull, and Undersecretary of State Welles. At the start of the meeting, the news published in Berlin regarding anti-German incidents in Polish Silesia and Hitler's possible action to forcibly annex Danzig caused temporary alarm.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The Navy Department abruptly ordered the fleet to return to the Pacific without explanation. The authorities had originally scheduled a formal fleet review in the Atlantic for April 27th, and the fleet had prepared to visit New York for the World's Fair. The arrival of this order was unexpected. Diplomatic circles interpreted this move as evidence of intelligence received, with President Roosevelt sensing the possibility of simultaneous action by Rome, Berlin, Tokyo, and Moscow, hence the need for preventative measures. The fleet was redeployed to the Pacific to counter the threat from Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The U.S. fleet has been ordered to cancel participation in the New York World's Fair and the Norfolk naval exercises and, after refueling, to return to the Pacific. The U.S. government's order stated, "All ships shall immediately return to their original defense in the Pacific." With the exception of the newly formed Atlantic Fleet, all national fleets must immediately return to their defenses. The government offered no explanation for issuing this order, but it is generally speculated to be related to the tense situation in Europe. The order was issued within two hours of Roosevelt's declaration calling for peace. It is generally speculated that U.S. authorities believe it necessary to concentrate the fleet in the Pacific as a precaution. It is also noteworthy that British naval power is now concentrated off the coast of Europe to prepare for war. The U.S. government issued the order in a shorter time frame than has been seen in years. It is generally estimated that it will take approximately three days to refuel all ships and thirteen to fourteen days to return to their original defenses. With the exception of the original Atlantic Fleet, five cruisers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier, which will remain in the eastern United States, approximately 120 warships must immediately return to the Pacific, including 56 warships participating in the World's Fair performance and "other missions." A small detachment of the European fleet is not affected by this order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The U.S. fleet was suddenly ordered to sail to the Pacific yesterday, reportedly due to intelligence received indicating that the international situation is about to take a sharp turn for the worse and that the Far East is also about to enter a vortex. According to another report, any new military action in Europe will inevitably involve the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines will also be affected. One diplomat stated that the movement of the U.S. fleet is related to Roosevelt's recent proposal to Hitler, aimed at preventing Japanese aggression, as Japan may expand its aggression while Europe is at war. However, this seems unlikely, as Japan must devote all its efforts to dealing with Chinese resistance in Manchuria and throughout China. At the same time, Japan's strength has been greatly depleted in China. Japan must be wary of the activities of the U.S. fleet, especially with the British deploying forces in Singapore, which will further deter Japan from acting rashly.</p>
<h3 id="e18">All of England Enthusiastically Commends, France Accepts Without Conditions <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] U.S. President Roosevelt's appeal to dictators to guarantee peace has been enthusiastically commended throughout England.</p>
<p>Lloyd George called it "a great and timely appeal to reason." Attlee said it was "a most valuable preliminary step." President Roosevelt's telegram stated, "Your Excellency has repeatedly stated that Your Excellency and the people of your country have no intention of war. If this is indeed the case, then there is no need for war." The local newspapers have highly praised this passage of the telegram. The U.S. President pointed out in the telegram that the people's fear must be ended, stating, "Unfortunately, we must recognize new realities. In Europe, three nations, and one in Africa, have all lost their independence. In the Far East, another independent nation has had a vast territory occupied by a neighboring country. Reports we believe to be true indicate that further aggression is being contemplated against other independent nations. In short, the world is moving towards a path that could lead to great disaster, unless a more rational approach can be pursued to avoid war." This passage of the telegram has attracted much attention here. President Roosevelt added that Americans are not speaking out of selfishness, fear, or cowardice. "I am speaking out of strength and as a friend of humanity." He continued, "International problems can be resolved at the conference table. This is not a matter for the military. In the conference room, as in a courtroom, both sides must discuss with sincerity and trust, predicting that both sides will gain practical benefits." Then, President Roosevelt, in explaining America's offer of friendly mediation, asked, "Are you willing to guarantee not to use force against the following independent nations?"</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax jointly issued a statement on behalf of the British government, warmly welcoming President Roosevelt's initiative, stating that the British government "fully agrees with the President's assessment of the international situation." The statement continued, "We believe that President Roosevelt's statesmanlike proposal can prevent the tragic situation in which all nations are living in anxiety." The statement concluded by stating that they must now await the responses from Germany and Italy but hoped that their replies "will begin the second step of the path mentioned by President Roosevelt."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Mr. Johnson, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy here, visited the British Foreign Office today to report to the British authorities on the contents of President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler and Mussolini. It is reported that the U.S. President did not consult with the British government beforehand. As of this morning, the British government has not had any hint of the President's intentions. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, who is spending the weekend at his country house, and Foreign Secretary Halifax, who is at his country residence in Yorkshire, have both been informed of the contents of the telegram.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] French Premier Daladier has delivered a note to the U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, conveying that France gives unconditional and complete acceptance of the U.S. President's proposal.</p>
<p>It is believed here that the U.S. President's telegram is sufficient to change the situation of the nation. "Le Temps" stated, "Hitler has personally portrayed himself as being interested in maintaining peace. This is the time for Hitler to provide proof to his people and the world."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 15th] The call of President Roosevelt to the dictators for a ten-year guarantee of peace is considered "bold and outspoken" and is admired.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Germany Decides to Reject U.S. Proposal, Italy Remains Silent <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] According to reliable sources, Hitler has completely rejected President Roosevelt's proposal, refusing both the convening of a peace conference and the pledge of no further aggression.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] According to reliable sources, Hitler and Mussolini spoke by telephone to discuss President Roosevelt's request for a guarantee of peace and decided to reject the U.S. President's proposal. It is reported that Hitler will issue a formal rejection or no response at all. The German Propaganda Ministry has not yet been able to confirm that Mussolini has also rejected the U.S. President's proposal but said that it is very likely that Mussolini will reject Roosevelt's proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop both arrived in Munich this afternoon.</p>
<p>(Hitler came from Berchtesgaden.) It is reported that the two are currently studying President Roosevelt's telegram. Officials have been busy translating the telegram from morning till night for Hitler to review. According to Reuters, the telegram has not caused excessive excitement. No conference will be held in Munich, and there will be no particularly eye-catching activities. There will be no announcement tonight. It is reported that Hitler will not return to Berlin until the day before Tuesday. Semi-official sources and the press have expressed absolute opposition to Roosevelt's telegram. One newspaper commented, "Roosevelt's telegram was misguided."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 16th] As of last night, Italian officials remained silent on Roosevelt's telegram and made no criticisms. It is reported that the telegram was not sent through normal diplomatic channels but was a personal telegram from President Roosevelt to the Italian leader. The telegram has not yet been published in Italy. It is currently unknown when officials will formally criticize the matter. It is reported that Mussolini and General Goering discussed the telegram during their meeting last night at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 15th] It is generally speculated that Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Goering, who are currently meeting closely, will jointly and thoroughly study Roosevelt's message. The two then jointly attended a banquet with the King and Queen of Italy. Mussolini also held a twenty-minute meeting with visitors after the parliamentary session. As of now, only a small number of people have heard of the U.S. President's message, and officials claim to be unaware of it.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Siam and Vietnam <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>If Siam were to embrace the Fascist bloc, it would naturally threaten British colonies in the Far East. However, French Vietnam is in a more dangerous position than British Burma. If Siam were to join the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it would first seek to recover Luang Prabang and Battambang. In addition, the French protectorates of Laos and Dong Pusai are also objects that Siam wants to seize. The people of Laos and Dong Pusai were conquered by Siam as early as the 16th century. After losing these places, a large part of Vietnamese territory would be lost. Added to this is an attack by Japan from Hainan Island, Vietnam would no longer be the French Vietnam.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of southern China and occupation of Hainan Island have made France's Far Eastern colonies uneasy. Siam's military strength has been increasing day by day since the last war. It has long implemented a conscription system, and can mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops in wartime. In recent years, Siam has also established a navy, ordering warships and submarines from Germany and Japan. The air force is also of a considerable scale. In wartime, it goes without saying that Vietnam is the most dangerous old enemy in the back. Therefore, the relationship between Vietnam and Siam is the most worrying point in the French colonial security issues in the Far East.</p>
<p>Britain and France are dealing with Siam in the same way as they are dealing with the Spanish Franco government, using loans, trade and all kinds of benefits as bait, hoping to ease the conflict with Britain and France. As far as the relationship between the two countries and Siam is concerned, there has been considerable success in recent months. The commercial treaty between Vietnam and Siam was signed a few months ago, and has now been approved by the parliaments of both France and Siam. France sent a military delegation to Bangkok three months ago. In this big exercise near the Vietnamese army and Lang Son, Siam also sent two officers to observe the exercise. It seems that Siam and Vietnam are maintaining a good neighborly relationship on the surface, which is true, but we know that the aggressor countries will not stop plotting to cause trouble. Once a European war breaks out and France's military strength in the Far East is weakened, no one can guarantee what the situation in southern Asia will be like. In order to protect its interests in the Far East, what strength will France rely on? Isn't it already too obvious?</p>
