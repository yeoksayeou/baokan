<h3 id="c1">戰地政治工作者在贛北 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 衛初寄自贛北前線</p>
<p>三月底，×人一方面攻南昌，一方面分兵先後攻佔奉新，高安，並繼續積極西犯。我們剛赶到高奉邊境，便奉到堵擊×人的任務。三十　日的下午，我們的先頭部隊與×人展開了血戰。師長立刻給了我們緊急的任務：動員民衆組織祖架隊，設傷兵運輸站。儘快的運送傷兵。雖然前綫的民衆多數逃亡了，動員是件極困難的事，但我們毫沒猶豫的接受任務，並連夜出發。目的地是雖開師部十多里路的一個村落——　坊。</p>
<p>老百姓跑光，連找個嚮導都不容易；好半天，才請到個老頭子。起先，他很害怕，不願意，先給了他二毫錢，幷保證他明天一定給他路條囘家，才高興地帶着我們定，所走的路全是小山坡，小樹林，要是沒有嚮導，不要說晚上，就連白天也難找。</p>
<p>前綫的砲聲越來越緊張，皎潔的月光，照耀着飛閃着血雨腥的長空與大地</p>
<p>肖坊，寂靜地躱在叢樹的圍抱中，深夜到達，首先要解决的問題是找到老百姓。我們開始去敲門，但有的不待你敲，早已人去戶空，有的却敲喊半天，沒有一聲囘昔。這使我們着急起來。村前村後找遍了，還是沒有結果，而同時天際却推進一塊烏雲，電光閃閃，說不定會遭大雨。急中生智，我們想到非惜重這位嚮導不可，政治工作從他做起。</p>
<p>「蓬蓬蓬」「……」敲着，還是沒有囘音。</p>
<p>「老表！老表！請你開門。」</p>
<p>「是誰？」老天，門裏聽是本地口音囘答了。</p>
<p>「是×××，××地方人，要商量借住一夜。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽夜半更深來這兒呢？」一個壯年男子聲音在問。</p>
<p>「給軍隊挑東西去的，……趕囘來，來不及了。」嚮導老表會變花樣。</p>
<p>「老表！剛才不還有兵在村子裏打門嗎？」婦人的聲昔。</p>
<p>「走了，走了，出村去了。」老表囘頭來對我們扮個鬼臉。</p>
<p>門一開，看昆我們幾個馬上又想關攏，但我們已　進去了。屋裏是烏黑的，只有一個老婆婆縮在角落裏發抖，輕輕地放下我們的東西和緩地上前去同她說：「老表嫂，不要怕，我們是抗日的軍隊，是來打日本</p>
<p>的，保護你們的。」「放心吧，我們抗日軍隊不拉夫，不打擾你們的！一又一個同志親切地和她講。同時，請嚮導的老表特別幫我們說明，解釋。半天，她才從黑角裏跑出來，抖抖地：「老總！你們是好軍隊，我無怕。」看她樣子，恐慌性還是很嚴重。便點了個亮甯靜地坐下來輕聲和氣的和她講，解釋，看她恐慌性減去了大半才問她：「老表嫂，還有你家許多人呢？」「老總！他們怕飛機，早跑了，就留我一個人在家！」她還是不信任我們。</p>
<p>後門開着，這分明是剛出去了人。溜出去一看，離開很近的小崗子上，擠着一簇人。「老表！不要怕，我們不拉佚！一話沒說完，一簇人沒命的翻過崗子去了。沒辦法，囘來冉同老婦人耐心誠意的講，好久，她終算信任了我們，提着燈，跑出後門去叫喊半天。一囘兒。男的，女的，小孩一個個溜囘來擠滿一屋子。</p>
<p>老婦人的兒子是個靑年學生，找緊他談半天，終算完全了解我們，幷且向他的家人作了一番解釋。</p>
<p>「唔！老總：過去一些壞的隊伍把我們嚇壞了！要不是媽媽來叫，我們只好露天過一夜。」一個少婦也大胆地同我們講起話來，引得大家發笑。</p>
<p>他們忙着給我們找門板，稻草，燒茶……，老太太又從房裏搬出二盤花生和　，熱閙地吃着，談着先前把我們看得比閻王還怕的，現在却看得像他們的親戚朋友一樣了。</p>
<p>一起床，第一件大事便是要找到鄕長。在前線，部隊人員要找鄉保長不是件容易的事。往往許多鄕保長你　他碰上面，問他鄉保長在那裏，他會囘答你：「這個狗×的，早逃走了。」當然，造成這樣現象　原因，是很多的，但主要的是一般　保長負責的不够，怕多事；其次是今天還有極少數的部隊，個別分子，對地方負責當局的種種不法　爲</p>
<p>我們由主入家的兒子領導着，毫不費力，直接找到了鄉長。他是一個靑年，活潑，有力。我們去的雖早，但他早在打電話，辦公事了。</p>
<p>當我們把要請他幫助動員民衆組担架隊的公事給他一看，他毫不猶豫，立刻答應了我們，幷馬上寫公事到各保去，像有力的號召一樣：「日本　　打到我們家鄉來了，我們要趕快起來帮助軍隊作戰，抬傷兵……規定每天還有五毛錢的工資……」飛快的叫公役們發出去，又去人通知鄰近的保長加緊動員。</p>
<p>我們靜靜地等他把公事辨完才開始談話。</p>
<p>「唔！不得了，簡直忙不開！」他搖着頭，撤亂的頭髮，赤着脚。</p>
<p>「鄕長！太辛苦了！」我們向他致一句誠摯的慰問話。</p>
<p>「那比得你們，？日××打到我們家來了，不辛苦點，不帮軍隊的忙，那還成話嗎？」</p>
<p>這位鄉長實在是難得的。上面的命令是這樣多：破壞公路，限幾天內要多少民佚，違令斬首；運粮食，要多少民佚，違令斬首；××司令部幾天內要多少民快，違令所首。但是，他鄕裏的農民，在緊張局面下，早就跑了好多。所需要的名額，早就超過了他所能動員的額子。但是，他說：「我並不逃，我盡量的辦，我準備着一個腦袋。……不過，上面把許多事壓在幾個鄕長的頭上是不對的，逃走了的鄕長，爲什麼不去追究他們呢？」</p>
<p>鄕長的生活費已經八個月沒發下來。報吿，請求都不中用。還有省裏規定的一些地方辨公費　特別費，也給縣長扣住了，不知做什麽用，地方上有很多要辦的事只有停頓不辦。係待出征軍人家屬哪，那些經費，都不知那裏去了。「啊！同志！你們不知當下級行政人員的苦！要不是我家裏還有幾文，眞要賣老婆幹公差了。」鄉長向我們發出慘痛的呼聲。</p>
<p>他想領導地方民衆打游擊戰，可是沒有槍。雖然已經向上峯呈請過。</p>
<p>談着，鄕長突然拿起桌子上的小鐘一看，已經快八點了，他馬上穿起衣鞋，挿上小槍。直爽地：「請你們坐一同吧，我要上公路去一　，看看他們破壞的情形，他很快的就走了。</p>
<p>忙着找房子，設運輸站，找稻草，準備担架，凖備茶次稀飯……有了十幾個民衆自動的帮助，一下子什麼都做完了。尤其主人家和他們的隣家，特別帮忙得大。這道理連勤務兵也懂了！『老百姓，祇要我們軍隊對他好，他是一定帮助我們的。官架子，脾氣，在老姓面前都要不得。』</p>
<h3 id="c2">進展中的冀南根據地 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 梁砭</p>
<p>冀南抗×動態</p>
<p>（民革社通訊稿）最近有位從河北前綫歸來，帶了很多消息，因爲沒有把它有系統的整理出來，只能零碎片面的寫幾點以饗關切着冀南情形的讀者。</p>
<p>一公務員的艱苦作風</p>
<p>冀南的政權，多半是經過了游擊隊和部份的正規軍無數次戰鬥，把×人趕走以後，才建立起來的，因而這裏民選的抗日政權，都特別保持着一種艱苦卓絕的精神和作風，一行政區（冀四一帶）的內邱縣政府人員，至今還吃着糖，他們把糠做着窩窩頭，但一定要趁着　吃，不然就散成一堆糠了。這種窩窩頭，是他們經常的粮食，吃下去洩不下來，大便的時候很痛苦。</p>
<p>在井隆縣，抗日政府的情形，也差不多，縣政府常是吃了早飯，還得趕快設法籌備晚飯的粮食。</p>
<p>縣長月津貼費衹有一元，（以前是五角）專員也只有兩元，但物質的困難，從不能影響他們的工作熱忱，相反的，他們是隨着華北的形勢更加緊急，而更表示他們的堅定和努力的。</p>
<p>二·自由進出×封鎖線</p>
<p>政府的堅苦奮鬥，軍隊的英勇作戰，削弱了×人在河北的力量，使河北廣大的民衆，都認淸最後勝利一定是中國的，羣衆條件良好，給政府和軍隊以很大的便利。</p>
<p>政府和軍隊的工作人員，可以化裝了老百姓坐火車到石家莊，到北平去，政府的合作社，可以到石家莊採買貨物，甚至於政府裏的工作人員囘到×區襄去過年，也不發生什麽問題，這主要是有羣衆的掩護。</p>
<p>高邑縣（平漢綫七）的大部是在×人區域裏，然而我們縣政府的人員穿了便衣照樣可以執行工作，執行國民政府的抗戰法令。</p>
<p>平漢綫本來是×人監視很嚴的，然而在我民衆的掩護下面，任何人，只要穿上了便衣，帶上了良民證，（×人發的，有時也不一定帶它），就可以自由的從路東走到路西，從西面走到東面，我們的隊伍是大批大批的通過封鎖綫；×人有時是知道的，但也對我們無可奈何。</p>
<p>三，偽組織也來慰勞</p>
<p>一個非常有趣的故事，這是今年一月發生的，地點在平漢綫附近的××縣，我們××軍一部消滅了一百多個×人，使當地的軍隊非常興奮，發動了大想模的慰勞運動，甚至×區裏的民衆也募捐了大批猪羊送來。有一個××縣的縣長，把自己的薪水扣下幾十元，從縣城里托人把錢送到我們抗日軍來，這一個故事說明了，我們的勝利，也深深地感動到僞組織的內部，我們相信只要我們勝利不斷的增加，僞組織的爭取與瓦解，是沒有問題的。</p>
<p>四，×人是我們的運輸隊</p>
<p>在冀南一帶所看見的電話線，都是灣灣曲曲的，或者是很多線接起來，據說，這都是×人送給我們的，×人在平漢線和其他交通線上的電話線，經常遭我們破壞，我們就把奪得×人的電線裝在自己的電　上。×人爲了維持通訊，不得不經常修理，但×人愈修理得勤，我們破壞得也愈勤，×人的電線也源源不斷地送給我們。</p>
<p>平漢線的火車也常遭我們藝擊，×人終要送一點禮物給我們。</p>
<p>五　冀西抗日根據地擴展着</p>
<p>在地圖上，可以看到平漢綫以西太行山以東有一個狹長的條子，這就是冀西抗日根據地，正太路以北屬于察冀邊區，以南屬於冀南行政區，這裏所講的便是以南的部份。</p>
<p>冀西　據地是赤手空拳地建立起來的，然而一年多來，它進步得很快。</p>
<p>公平負担已開始實行了，參政會也巳開始建立，群衆也一天一天在健全鞏固中，政府已能作到統籌統發，日漸機構更鞏固起來，冀西的空氣是很活躍的，冀西的鞏固與擴大，對于冀南行政區的發展實有極大的作用。</p>
<h3 id="c3">兒童團體在桂林 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 秋江</p>
<p>（桂林通訊）兒童，是新中國的新生命，他們是新中國的　徵。</p>
<p>現在舉起他們的小脚己踢翻過去大人們對『孩子』的輕視意識，以事實反駁了「誰說我們年紀小」，以行動證明了兒童的力量，新安旅行團的十二歲的范政小朋友，在『救亡日報』寫出大人一樣老練的文章，叙述兒竄的力量。白健生先生九歲的女公子白先慧，在音樂會上指揮幾個兒童唱歌，小孩子也能做一部份大人做的事了。『一代比一代强』，這個信念，翻滾在大人們的心頭上，同時，也感動着有些不長進的大人們</p>
<p>在「八一三」中長成的「孩子劇團」，實行陶行知先生的「生活卽敎育，社會卽學校一敎育理論的「新安旅行團」到了桂林後，這群兒童們的集體的生活工作敎育，影響了　西的兒童。他們最初的結合，是在去年十二月的廣西兒童歌　大會。他們在幫助廣西兒童舉辦歌詠大會中，發現了廣西兒童組織的不够，黨部方面希望他們來加强廣西的兒童組織，從此「老大哥」的兒童團，在桂林兒童中起了很大的影響。而他們眞像個「老大哥一的樣子，愛護着，領導着，使廣西兒童在有組織中工作生活學習，發揮兒童的力量，帮着大人打日本</p>
<p>桂林六偭兒電團，成立較早的是「廣西省各界抗×後援會兒童工作團」，這個兒童團，歷史不長，爲現在國民黨黨部指導之下興奮的做兒童救亡工作。可惜經費不多，不易開展工作。</p>
<p>不過，兒童都住宿在家裏，集體的生活工作學習不可能，這是桂林所有兒童團的缺憾，不是兒童們貪戀着父母的慈愛。要是你不信的話，我可以引用「兒童敎育團」專孩子們嚷着：『我們眞羨慕你們（新安旅行團），大家住在一起，一塊兒學習，一塊兒工作，一塊兒跑，那樣多快活啊』！的話來解釋的。他們的困難，是幾十個小肚皮每天的給養沒有辦法經常籌集。但是，生活雖然不在一起，工作精神還是緊張的，工作分配到孩子身上，沒有一個說『媽媽不准來』和藉故推諉。冒着大雨去離桂林三十里的大墟去宣傳，慰勞傷兵。</p>
<p>在工作中得到了鼓勵和信心，兒童工作團負責生活指導的小朋友說：「有些傷兵不守紀律，打罵老百姓，但是對我們孩子倒又很好，我們去批評他們，那些傷兵都能聽從，就是一般老百姓也都接近我們」。這是孩子們的力量的偉大。</p>
<p>兒童工作服務團與見童教育團之外，還有中山紀念學校兒童戰時服務團，廣西兒童保育院救亡工作隊，新安旅行團和「新旅」西南工作隊。前兩個因爲他們的積極，在桂林兒童團裏自然顯出主要性。後面兩個是桂林兒童團的「老大哥」，在工作上生活上學習上都起着領導和影響的作用。爲要使桂林兒童團有總的領導機關，組織，『桂林兒童團體座談會』。討論宣傳工作分配與計劃，時事問題和對外活動等問題外，最重要是解决討論各兒童團體在組織上，領導上，工作生活學習上遭遇的困難。他們還編『抗戰兒童』週刊。白健生先生招待他們看了蘇聯的『大張撻伐』影片後，座談會寫信向白主任致熱烈的謝意，並且在信上提出他們的具體的感想。在看影片時，白主任敎他的孩子向他們學習，可見他對這些孩子們的愛護。</p>
<p>他們眞勇敢，今年兒童節在桂林發起『萬元兒童　金運動』。『新旅』小朋友打算寫一本『中國兒童運動的理論』書，內容分組織與理論和現在與將來四部門。因爲『新旅』工作範圍分散，他們團裏的一個放牛的，江北孩子——曾兆壽，用舊的無綫電器材配置無綫電收發報機，與散佈各處的工作支隊通訊。『新旅』負責的小朋友，需要發展他們的興趣與天才，不問經濟如何困難，盡量支持他。</p>
<p>廣西以外的兒童砠織，長沙有田漢先生領導的『難童隊』；南昌最多，有三十二軍的孩子劇團；八個少年團，十二個以學校爲基礎的兒童團；安源扶輪小學的孩子劇團；鄂北均縣的『抗戰兒童讀做會』；放火燒粮倉的安徽壽縣的『抗日兒童團』一槍救淪陷區內小孩子的『新四軍兒童團』『廣東兒童劇團』和曲江『兒童歌詠隊』；貴陽的一三民主義少年團』，還有許多沒有寫到的兒童團，都自己組織起來了，站在孩子的崗位作英勇的抗戰。</p>
<h3 id="c4">決死隊在晉西 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 戴富</p>
<p>（晉西通訊）臨汾，襄陵，翼城，浮山四縣的邊界，是一片山　　疊，溝道綜錯的山地，西面離同蒲鐵路只有二十來里路南可控制曲高公路的曲翼段，北能够切斷臨浮，車道，東面憑着崎嶇的地形可能完全阻障翼浮的交通。×人佔領了臨汾和曲沃，這一地帶是平靜的，×人不常來，來了擄掠東西就走了。但在去年八月間開來了靑年抗×决死第×總隊，一切都活躍起來了。</p>
<p>同蒲路上的電綫，一夜會有百十斤不翼而飛，鐵軋上的螺旋釘，鐵　，枕木，天亮時會發現有的拋下汾河，有的丟到山濤，有的不知去向，臨汾張禮，史村等車站上的『皇軍』，十個八個也不能到鄕下走了白時時，天有突然炸彈在他們面前爆炸起來。</p>
<p>×人知道游擊隊的消息之後，曾利用漢奸偵察，實行掃蕩。然而不是撲個空，便是轟幾砲，搖搖頭退囘城去。</p>
<p>决死隊在戰鬥中强壯而健全了。在這個小游擊區裏，不分白天和黑夜，活動一個月的結果，是×人在掃蕩搖頭之後，專門以一千多人，分駐從臨汾到曲沃同蒲沿綫的村莊。甚麽地方都會有决死隊的戰士，突然發現。因此，凡是靠近鐵路的村子。×人必得駐兵。</p>
<p>因着戰爭的延長，「皇軍一也沒有很多大米運來了，他們需要麥子和菜蔬。這些東西要向鄉下取，×人常以二百人的部隊到離鐵路十來里的村子來搶掠；一搶劫就會有人去報吿到决死隊，對鎖×人生活需要品的决死隊，於是佈置埋伏，擊散×人，將搶囘的東西，交還給老百姓。</p>
<p>×軍不敢單身離開駐在的鄉村，他們怕遇到突然而來的搶彈和手榴彈。</p>
<p>這裏的老百姓原有組織的，犧盟，農救，婦救，自衛隊，　不脫離生產的），越接近×區越採取秘密工作方式，也越發揮出偉大的作用。在白天，如果×人掃蕩來了。女人和老人會走光，靑年人會燒荼意謂，並且冒着彈雨送給正在戰鬥士兵吃。受了傷的被抬到後邊去馬上就有婦女來照料了。决死隊在這裏打過很多仗都是這樣的。决死隊和老百姓沒有分別，戰鬥時決死隊靠老百姓帮助，戰鬥後老百姓有受傷的便抬到决死隊後方醫院裏去。</p>
<p>老百姓夜晚在村外放哨。士兵和老百姓等不多都認識了，深夜破了鐵道，走到任何一個村子，只要和村外一個自衛隊的哨兵一說，在村外等一會兒，就可以有一羣拿了傢俱的老百姓來，跟着去挖鐵軌和枕木。</p>
<p>電民密切的合作，鞏固了這個小游擊區。</p>
<p>雖然是個小游擊區，却發生了這樣的作用：威脅了同蒲綫，牽制了×人的兵力；使僞政權只能在城裏行使，保衛了廣大鄕村人民的生命財產；使×人不能無顧　地佔領浮山，翼城。</p>
<p>在×人正在布置進攻整個晉東南的現在，對於這個小游擊區，自然是不能不盧淸的。二月中下旬，×人佔領了翼城，浮山並開始五路（臨汾，史村，翼城，響水河，浮山）進攻。步騎砲聯合兵隊，約在三千人以上但决死隊在南判橋打了個伏擊，斃×三百餘人，突圍了。山地裏，×人不能久駐久只一天的時聞又退出，决死隊又　　囘到了原來的地方。軍民密切作合之下，這個小小的游擊區是鞏固了。</p>
<h3 id="c5">日圓集團與「華興銀行」 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 吳芝軒</p>
<p>日閥對華的設手，是經濟武力管雙齊下的。它仇視中國法幣的制度群固。故處心積慮，　意破壞已非一日；去年在華北設立一聯合準備銀行一，發行無準備之「聯銀」券，金圖驅逐法幣。並謀獨占在華貿易與資源，又把一　聯合準備銀行』拉入日圓集團。此項手段，在僞滿雖略見效；在華北，顯已失敗法幣在華北依舊　持其信用，擁有雄厚的勢力，雖屢用武力弱　貶抑法幣的價値，但不獨未被抵，『聯銀』券的價値反日益暴跌，最近「抑券』的晤盤行市，已僅　法幣八角右左。</p>
<p>最近上海日圓之慘跌，雖有種種因素，其與『聯券』之聯繫，亦爲日圓跌價主因之一，誠可　害人自害。</p>
<p>『聯合準備銀行』旣挫敗在先，最近竟又在上海設立僞『華興商業銀行』，計劃中的『華興券』决定與日圓　絕關係，這是吃了一次大虧學到的一次乖，自知「華興銀行』决無前途，所以索性一刀兩斷，脫離關係，至其流通方策，據說是：（一）特定商品以「華興」幣專賣。（二）以「華興」幣强迫收買淪陷區物產。（三）規定以『華興』幣交易。（四）一切租稅，郵遞，電報，電話，電燈，自來水等及車船票，均以「華興」幣繳付。五）僞機關之一切支付，皆用「華興」幣。探其用意不外：（一）欲　制留易。（二）以「華興」幣直接至淪陷區，徵收物安。（三）企圖搗亂華中金融。（四）因日本紙幣澎漲過甚未便再發，今後軍餉所需。改發無準備之『華興券』使其苟延殘喘</p>
<p>偽「華興銀行」之前途，視華北「聯銀一之失敗，當可預卜。以與日圓連繫之聯銀」券，尙且大跌其　，何况與日圓雖集團斷絕關係之華興一幣。卽使日方以長江商業爲要挾，迫英·美·法·日方編導此僞券，根本目的卽在排斥歐美在華之市場故英·美·法·决無收納僞幣，主持僞方之理。</p>
<p>至於上的銀錢業方面，早已表示拒絕收受，卽一般小錢莊亦不予收兌。</p>
<p>上海是一個入超的商埠；華興銀行一想控制外匯，更屬渺茫；因其旣無鉅額之外匯基金，倛給　口外匯；所能攫得之出口外匯，亦必有恨。故預上卜海之外匯市場，今後仍舊爲外商銀行所控制。</p>

<p>— 楊凡</p>
<p>（本報特約通訊稿）</p>
<p>我軍一天天迫近了增城，離增城僅二里，石灘也是一樣的威脅着×人。如果增城石灘均爲我軍克服，廣州的×人就會受到軍大威脅西北江的×人，也要受到大大的牽動，因此×人恐慌了，趕快從廣州調兵千餘人至增城，也從北江從化調兵八千餘人來迀迴我軍，攻擊羅浮山。掃蕩增博（一部份）。因此，一福×人殘暴行爲的慘景，又在增博展開了，但，這又是這里從鬥爭中鍛練出來英勇的民衆。在民挨解放史上又寫上光輝的一頁。</p>
<p>一、×機狂炸下變成了焦土</p>
<p>×人進攻的地方，首先以空軍大肆轟炸，當然這次進攻羅浮，掃蕩增博，同樣派遣了不少的空軍，天天活躍在這里上空，在聯和，福田，瀾石，酥醪麻搾，證果，派潭……都投下不少的炸彈和機槍的掃射，本來這有許多地方，早在以前淪陷的時候，巳經焚燒炸燬了不知多少的建築物，這一次却把前僅留下得的建築物來個淸澈的轟炸，特別是福田和派潭變成了一片焦土，福田是犧牲了四十多人，博羅城有一次也死傷了一百多人。</p>
<p>二、×軍佔領鄉村的焚掠×殺</p>
<p>×軍在佔領地的焚掠×殺是它的退步戰爭野蠻的具體表現，過去聽見許多，不，親眼見過許多，這次×人掃蕩，也是這樣殘暴，看見房屋就是放火燒燬，派潭，證果，蘭溪，酥醪，聯和，福田，特別是派潭燒殺得最利害，因爲派潭的民衆英勇的抵抗，這是出×人意料之外，一個伏擊消滅了四五百『皇軍』，我們方面也光榮的犧牲了八十多位戰士。因此，派潭有就燒有就殺，其他的都是燒了幾百聞的房屋，×××××，因×軍的迅速行動，走避不及的，都給皇軍做了慰勞隊，粮食牲口，當然，是×人最答歡後方不易接濟的給養的，但，×人除了大焚燒大屠殺的×行外，還用懷柔政策來對付農民，在福田給俘着的民衆，從他一身精細的檢查，認爲眞是農民的，則以手作勢挿秧吃飯，肩上拍之叫他定，當然它有點懷疑的，霜白的刺刀，便插進了肉的胸口。</p>
<p>這里前綫的民衆，是給×敎會了，他們從×人那里給他的經騐敎訓中，是有了對付×人的辦法，這次給×人掃蕩增博（一部份）的民衆，一般都做了堅壁淸野的工作，不過是不澈底的，這是經驗吿訴他們，×人是沒有較長時間佔領過他們的，×人來一下是要縮囘去。因此，他們這種工作就只限於這個「經驗』的範圍內了。下次是希望他們能够瞭解其體×情，做到有效的工作，需要時井裏下毒藥塡井的工作也要的。民衆動員方面，有的鄉村都能做到這一步；一，×來嗚鑼吿警，二，靑年集合，武裝集合上山去，三，老幼到安全地方去躱避。當然他們物質是隨身帶走的，他們屢次曾打擊過××人，不過，因爲他們的組織，還不健全，前幾次都不過起些小作用。</p>
<p>四、派潭民衆的英勇勝利</p>
<p>特別是派潭的民衆在這次光榮勝利的鬥爭，是會使×人認識到我們民衆偉大的力量，是可以爲民衆抗日的模範。過去，×人第一次到派潭的時候，一派潭的民衆，是一點沒有意識到什麽叫做抗日，不少的民衆，捧着禮物以迎皇軍，可是皇軍的囘禮是一輪機關槍，於是派潭的民衆，便得到良好的敎訓。這次派潭的民衆，是認淸了×人自己，事先開了個全鄕大會，議决：所有武器的靑年，不論武器的優劣，都集中去打擊×人，不去的內部先把他槍决。因此他們集中幾百枝槍，靠着有利地形，伏擊八千多的×人，×軍是傷亡了四五百人，派潭民衆也光榮犧牲了八十餘位（傷亡），這八十餘位民族英雄的鮮血，當然，是把民挨解放之花，灌溉得更壯茁吧！</p>
<p>五、羅浮山趙道士還要拿槍來幹一幹</p>
<p>××軍攻破了羅浮山的酥醪洞，酥醪觀的道士，也免不了皇軍給道士們一個好的光顧，趙道十也就要拿槍來幹一幹。趙道士是長得很胖的，肚子很膨大，臉很紅潤，年紀在四十餘五十歲的邊前，左脚是個跛的，記者前次到酥醪觀，和他談話過，他很識得世故，那時就知道他是曾經滄桑世故的一個消極者，這次記者在酥醪觀碰着他，他却不像前次那樣的道士消極態度了。一開話匣，他就憤激地這樣說：『我趙書麟，入酥醪觀十餘春，靜養晚年，因爲我是看醒了『世界』，以前我是在軍隊里當過書記，後來也當得營長，做得營長，好多事情自己更不滿意去做，便把賺得一點錢，帶來羅浮山修道。一千銀同人在麻榨墟做生意，今則店被燒燬了，錢是落空了，身上袋的四十塊錢，也給日本鬼搶去』。這時他說得很亮很急，拐杖在地板用力的一頓，引起了四　的囘響。「你想國家危亡，道士也做不成，我還要拿槍來幹一幹。」他的瞼上，浮顯得更紅了，兩邊額角的靑筋，卜卜的在跳動，子是緊緊握着拐杖，拐杖在那里顫動。</p>
<p>『國家危亡，誰也活不成，大家都要拿槍來幹一幹。』記者補了他這一句。</p>
<p>六、劫後民衆的生活</p>
<p>刦後民衆的生活，要算是一最嚴重的問題了。他們的房屋財物，一次難倖免一次的燒劫，劫後空餘，生活祇得挨餓挨凍冷了。現在它們件的房屋，多數是在燒掉的房子頂上，舖蓋茅草，或一兩塊竹搭舖舖，就成了住所，假如下起大雨來，這兩板　裂了的牆，又遭雨的濕潤，誰都會躭心住在這兩板牆下的在那一個時候會變成壓死鬼。吃的，同樣是這樣艱苦，祇要不挨餓，有蕃薯吃也就算是頂好，闊氣一點的也不過是蕃薯粥，記者親眼見過一家人吃飯，孩子拿起了一倏蕃薯，『媽媽，我不要蕃薯，』「不吃蕃薯吃什麽」父親的嚴訓，孩子手里的蕃薯鬆掉地下，眼睛瞪着父親，張大口哭了。總之他們的生活，是這樣的挨飢挨凍，最低限度也不能得過了。</p>
<p>現在×人退囘去了，留下的是個『仇恨』和那依然是那麽雄壯偉大的羅浮山的大自然，『仇恨』是會變成燒遍原野的大火，燒死那隻兇獸。羅浮山我也恭祝它將來改變爲偉大的埋葬×人的大墳墓。</p>

<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>本報特約通訊（上）</p>
<p>××道上</p>
<p>南嶽本爲中國的名山四嶽之一，以前香火甚盛。山上有佔地百畝而極宏偉的大雄寳殿，其華麗的程度並不亞於皇宮，雕龍繡鳳，樑柱亦都刻有花紋。朝香拜佛的進善男信女，据當地人說，往往會接踵於數十里而不斷絕。然而以現在的情形講，一切都完全改變了，繼山之後，南嶽亦將成爲現代史上的勝地，××會議中委員長對於戰局的整個分析更是民族革命史上劃時代的文獻。四月廿六日記者離長沙搭省府便車赴××。此行目的當然在一見鍛鍊中的民族解放戰爭的新鬥士，和在軍事敎育史上放最高度光彩的游擊幹部訓練班。正如白崇禧先生所說游擊戰是具體實現全面戰的最好方法，他建議創立幹訓班的用意，自然是要在質量上強化游擊隊伍，盡量發揮游擊戰術的功能以達到變×人後方爲前綫，積小勝爲大勝而進行所謂軍事，政治，經濟，文化各方面的全面反攻。</p>
<p>由長沙經湘潭至衡山這一路皆是平地，公路甚好，我們因為車子中途拋錨，所以到××已甚晚。雖說此地不過是個四五百人家的鄉鎮。但來往人仕，亦不在少。在某處無意中遇到了陳烈先生，他是幹訓班的政治部主任，個子並不高大，那種堅强結實的樣子，表現出當年雞公山前殲敵的威風。遇見了他，減除了所有一切轉折通達的麻煩，因此我便把一封給湯恩伯敎務長的介紹信托他帶交。</p>
<p>五點多鐘的光最，招待所門前的指揮車上跳出了一員曾被稱爲鐵人的大將，這就是湯恩伯，表情非常痛快爽達，說話亦很懇切豪偉，以外表講，頗有現代張翼德的風味。李蒙夫婦說：『單從態度動作看，我們會疑心湯將軍乃是李宗仁先生的弟弟，因爲你們有着許多相同的地方。』這句話引起我們大笑了一陣，其實從台見莊以來，李湯本來就是一貫合作的老搭擋，很少分離，這正像梅蘭芳的戲如果不配以王少卿的二胡，便不免要減低味兒一樣，若是有李宗仁而不加上湯恩伯，在戰場上亦似乎還不够熱烈。這次鄂北的空前勝利，我們不能不承認是由於成千弟兄的血肉和李湯智勇的指揮所換取來的民族光榮。時間隨着每一張嘴唇煥奮的顫動，很快地溜走了。三十分鐘之後，我們送湯先生跨出招待所的大門。這時候，夕陽斜照着垂柳梢頭，南嶽道上呈現出金黃色的一片，景色無限可愛。</p>
<p>××嶺上的飛行軍</p>
<p>因爲昨日旅途辛勞，今晨起床，已見紅日滿窗，約將八點鐘了。洗刷剛畢，茶房進來說：「有一位鄧先生來訪」接着我便跨出房門。鄧先生交給我一張湯恩伯先生的卡片，說是請我們上山去的。一面收給行李，一面便與這位年育的弟兄開始閑談起來，首先我心中忖想這位鄧先生至多不過是湯總部的副官吧了。這印象是由於年齡和服裝兩個條件所織成的。然而，以貌相人終不確當，鄧先生乃是幹訓班的副總隊長，並且還是少將階級，所謂生活士兵化，在此地可算已有了具體的表現。</p>
<p>我與鄧先生再加李蒙夫婦，一行四個人，擠上了一輪小汽車，肩膊貼緊肩膊，飛速地穿過了路旁柳絲交織成的垂簾。每在轉灣的路角上都有委員長的肖像，畫在雪白的木板上，看了令人肅然起敬。山腰兩旁的石壁上，寫着許多標語，其中心意思當然皆是關於游擊戰術。</p>
<p>松林中傳出幾陣歌聲，『我們都是飛行軍，那怕那山高水又深』，鄧總隊附吿訴我們這是同學們在做野外實習，他們到處都是講堂，到處都是操場，生活緊張而快樂，艱苦而興奮，眞是一羣靑年精壯的飛行軍。</p>
<p>總隊長陳××也是個很年輕的人物，他是第××師師長，抗戰中亦立過了不少的汁馬功績他領我們到學校的各部份去參觀了一下，有幾點的確是特別可以注意的，（一）飯廳裏有講台並掛着一塊黑板，這表示一物二用，當飯廳亦可作會場，並且同學間若有事須討論的話，亦可立刻提出民主地討論。（二）壁報在此地非常普遍，每隊皆有一個。內容與編排亦都十分充實和整齋。有詩歌，有漫畫。（三）內務非常整　，雖然此地的校舍建築以及一切物質條件都不及軍校或航空學校，可是內務的講究，其成績的表現却决不比前者所稍差，被單折成四方地像荳腐干一塊。（四）對於日常生活或敎師的敎授法都有提出意見討論的發言園地，有的竟把自己的意見畫成簡明的，圖案，其表現的辦法十分生動而意思則尤十分深沉。靶子場上槍聲甚密据說是女生在練習打靶，李蒙太太聽了甚為興奮，我們乃繞過了課堂，出邊門，走到靶子場參觀娘子軍操演，果然，場上排着兩挺機關槍，十幾個女生輪流射擊，這都是現代的花木蘭，女的飛行軍，堅强的機關槍手。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 叔康</p>
<p>—本報倫敦特約通訊—（中）</p>
<p>——在蘇談判——英德關係——英法與德意——西班牙的爭奪——巴爾幹的徬徨——英土公約——希——羅馬尼亞——南斯拉夫——</p>
<p>在，請大家打開歐洲地圖，在地中海的最西一端作爲入海唯一孔穴的，是世界聞名的直布羅陀海峽，亦最東的一端，是聯接了紅海的蘇彝士運河，誰都知道，這是英法兩國海上交通的最大生命綫，可是，同時誰也都知道，這是德意發展夢想中大帝國的唯一最基本的根據地。</p>
<p>記者前次通訊，曾指陳過德意在非洲近來的一些軍事上的準備，和政治上的陰謀。那裏所指的非洲部份，就是坐落在地中海的半腰。自然，那些準備和陰謀，近來並沒有停頓，而反在加緊：不過，却也沒有値得注意的新的發展，現在引起我們法目的，却在地中海的兩端，西端，是西班牙情勢的推移；柬端，是巴爾幹各國的徬徨歧路。一說起根本來，是一個東西，德意的壓力在加緊。</p>
<p>西班牙的情勢</p>
<p>最近有兩椿最値得注意的事：一，是德國艦隊的居然離開，另一，是戈林預定的西班牙之行，突然作罷。這些，是表示着一件事，德意對佛期哥施以壓力，使他變爲完全俯首帖耳的奴隸過程上，又有了問題。</p>
<p>當然，佛朗哥終於依然是奴隷，可是，問題儘管不大，但也還是存在着的。</p>
<p>問題在那裏呢？大家都知道，佛郞哥已經接受了德意的壓力，加入了「防共協定」；又把所有的土地，幾乎都已獻給了德意的戰略家，作爲他們未來對英法戰爭的根根據地，而預先佈置着。不過有一椿事，他一直到現在還沒有接受；那是：在正式慶祝內戰勝利的那天，向英國明白地提出收囘失地——直布羅陀海峽裏的英屬直布羅陀軍港，對這，佛朗哥一直是在拒絕着；因爲他對英法借款的想頭，始終沒有斷過。於是，慶祝勝利的日子，就一再改期了；而相應着爲英法所最關心的德意撤退志願兵的問題，德意方面，也就一直不肯讓步。</p>
<p>這種僵持的局而，一直到了最近，却忽然釀出了兩個非常重大的內政與外交纏起來的危機；依了德國爲背景，西班牙最反動的法西斯派的首領，現在內長的松納爾（Suner），近來在計劃着取佛朋哥而代之的政治陰謀，是突然暴露了。這令佛朗哥對德國大大地不高興起來。於是，作爲一種示威起見，他一面以書面要求德意先把他們比英法軍優越的地方，顯示給他看；否則，他不願公開反英，另一面，他向英國的大使說，事實上，他是終於會和德意分手的，不過「時機還沒有成熟」，像這種情勢發展下去，不是佛期哥的完全屈服或被根本推倒，那末，國際七鬥爭的勢力，是有藉了西班牙的舞台，再來一次內亂可能的。同時，在那佛朗哥統治下的西班牙，前政府軍的舊勢力，又是在這裏那裏地潛伏着，等待再出現的機會。這，就是目前第一個危機。某次，爲了澈底根絕英國在西班牙金融勢力使入的可能，近來德國駐西班牙的大使，忽然奉到了命令，根據這，他曾向佛朋哥提出警吿：目前一般認爲親英色彩太重的佛朗哥的最大金融支持者的馬區March必須立刻排去，然而佛期哥却竟然予以拒絕，於是，這在現在就又造成了德意與佛朗哥之間的另一緊張，而成爲危機的第二件。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c33">天津局勢的嚴重性與英國 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>日來各方的消息，均報吿日本侵擾天津英法租界的嚴重局勢。日本對英國租界的威脅尤其厲害，在數日前卽已實行經濟的封鎖，法租界也被波及，聞各種貨物除日用必需品外，一概不得輸入或輸出兩租界，各商船也無從停靠兩租界的碼頭。昨晚外訊更傳：英法租界的日僑早經陸續遷囘日租界內，正金銀行天津支店及偽聯合銀行外匯局的日籍職員，也於十一日相繼遷出英法租界。外間傳說日方將于日內封鎖英法兩租界，這種嚴重的局勢爲以前所未有。但是日方用意所在，應有深刻的認識才好。</p>
<p>日方對英國的進攻，無論在華南，抑在華北仍未出威脅與利誘的作風，惟是最近因見英方在歐洲或在遠東態度的猶豫與軟弱，所以作法更來得毒辣些，這幾大天津租界的風浪卽其一例。日方要求於英國者，還是：放棄對中國的積極援助，聽從日本的苛刻要求，甚至於帮它壓迫我國的抗日行動。日方還時常假惺惺地宣傳：倘英國能適應日方的這種要求，則日本可以尊重英國在華的權益。但這很顯明的，是一種欺騙。須知日本的最終目的是在「建設所謂東亞新秩序」，換句話說，就是要由日本獨佔東亞全部以遂其政府中人所提倡的所謂天下三分論」的志願，其欲獨佔中國全土，更無庸論了。×××××××××××××××××××。</p>
<p>日本在勢力還不足以與英國抗拒，或籠罩中國全土的今日，或者還要玩一玩手段，以一部分權益鈎引英國讓步，即放還一部分權益套換另一部分權益，或者以某些條件，誘惑英國壓迫我國抗日行動，也是可能的。但須知道：日本這種作法確是各個擊破的手段，中國抗日力量削弱一分也即英國在華權益的保障減少一層。一部分英人或者難免抱着什麼幻想，但其終局利益却須密切考慮。</p>
<p>日方對英的進攻，一面是在響應德意，另一面又是在離間英蘇。前者作爲未加入德意軍事同盟的陪禮，後者更用以欺騙英國。這次天津的波浪中，日方竟利用『白俄防共委員會』佔領天津的俄租界的蘇聯領事館，自非偶然。張伯倫及哈立法克斯昨日演說對侵略者態度的軟化，適足以助長這種趨勢。日方通訊社正擴大宣傳，稱：將於一二日內對天津外國租界採取「實際行動」。這正如孟却斯特導報的評論：「張伯倫首相的妥協政策，已使日本領袖認爲可藉威脅而驅英國勢力於中國之外」。</p>
<p>爲今之計，英國應採取强硬的態度，予浸略者以有效的抗拒，並須聯合法美蘇共同行動。法美的在華權益也與英國同樣受到威脅與危害，日本雖然對美國稍爲客氣，但其實際的危害則無二致。蘇聯更願意與英國合作。張伯倫若以爲延宕英蘇法的互助協定的締結，，那就正如上引孟却斯特導報的評論：「實屬大錯而特錯」了。</p>

<p>【路透社敦倫十二日電】曼却斯脫導報著論稱、「尋求日本何以必欲公開激起英日决裂之理由、如屬可能、則任何人不能承認日本之决心顯願如此、英國援助中國之程度、不獨遜於德國、抑亦未見稍過於美國、然則日本定因宿怨或別有原因而獨與英作對、更或以英國爲可欺、而引爲日本失敗之代罪者、日本是否因拒絕參加三國軍事協定、而欲以此種挑撥行爲、稍慰德國之渴望、抑或張伯倫首相之妥協政策、已使日本領袖認爲可藉威脅而驅英國勢力於中國之外、此時實應予以制止矣、日本政府應負其咎、並當予以警吿、聲明倘再繼續此種政策、則將發生如何局面、美法在華利益固亦同遭日人蹂躪、英政府應立卽與美法政府共商對策、以遠柬任由侵略爲對歐洲糾紛允守中立之代價者、實屬大錯特錯、信約固可遺棄、而日本乃在遠東而非在歐洲」云。</p>

<p>— 季云</p>
<p>約　翰</p>
<p>天下男子一般蠢</p>
<p>我和約翰離婚了。</p>
<p>眞奇怪，你別看約翰長着六尺的身材，豐滿的肌肉；但，他總脫不了那副娘兒腔。這，我原也不覺得；後來結婚了兩年，才給我看出來。</p>
<p>那是一次，他丟了事情，恰巧我却找到了職業，能有點收入支持家用，你猜怎着麼？約翰竟老老實實在家里做起管家和烹調的瑣事來。每天總是推說明天一定出去找事；可是，明天又甲天，他依然在家里蹲着。</p>
<p>於是，我才明白，我們的婚姻是錯誤的；我根本不能做成他的賢妻；他需要的，是一個極度女性化的嬌弱女子。這樣，他便不得不自己出門去找出路了。</p>
<p>泰　來</p>
<p>我離婚之後不久，便遇着了泰來，一個風流個儻的人物。他是一家大公司的營　主任。一開頭就對我大獻殷勤，天天帶我跑夜總會和戲院不斷地送我鮮花與禮物。</p>
<p>這樣自然我也給感動起來了。可是，不久之後，我可又看明白，泰來是一個自視太　的人，跟約翰完全不同。</p>
<p>泰來對衣履異常考究，小賬給的特別親。在電梯里，如果誰鬧了他一下，他决不會干休；在菜館里，更是　毛求疵得利害。在他的心目中，除了他，世界上人都不行。他手下的營業員是蠢貨，他的上司是傻瓜。</p>
<p>泰來是他母親的獨子，自然是嬌慣了的。那是很明白了，　要嫁給他，一定得一天到晚把他捧得像個上帝才行。</p>
<p>亞瑟</p>
<p>每個女人都會遇到像亞瑟那樣的男人，他是一家大建築公司的高級戰員，公司里是很倚軍他的。我們的友誼進行得很慢，但是，等到我漸漸跟他晰熟了之後，我是愈加欽佩他了。</p>
<p>亞瑟學問很好，幷且談吐風生。唯一的毛病，只是缺少點勇氣去表示出自己的心思。</p>
<p>他巳經很愛我了，但他却不說出來，讓時間來慢慢表示。他有點不大能决斷，我們出去玩的時候，這樣，那樣，他總是問我。</p>
<p>對別的女人，這樣的丈夫，也許頂合式了。但我却不　　要一個死心蹋地專事伺候的丈夫。</p>
<p>羅　勃</p>
<p>我在一次宴會上邂逅了羅勃，他是一個討人歡喜的小夥子，才廿一歲，剛自大學里出來，抱着滿腔征服世界的執望。他很快地愛上了我，要求跟我結婚。「我是世界上唯一的女人」。</p>
<p>我也是挺歡嘉他的，但是我比他大六歲！在體騐上講，我也許比他大二十歲。我感覺到，他是在找一個母親，不是在找一個妻子。</p>
<p>羅勃早年喪母，是內兩個姑母撫養大的，根本沒有嘗過母愛，現在，他是在需要一個母親。</p>
<p>哈羅</p>
<p>不久之後，我遇到了哈羅。他是一問神經質的人，三十六行，行行試過。他常常在冥想，發明一行玩意，賺個幾百萬塊，但他始終仍是住在一間簡單的屋子裏。</p>
<p>他雖然不發財，但用錢倒爽，有多少化多少，些毫不吝嗇。</p>
<p>當他對發明的興趣低减之後，他對我大大的熱烈起來，我又是「世界上第一個女人」，他說我要是拒絕嫁他，他要去自殺。我拒絕了，他汹了兩星期的酒，又去與別的事，發生興趣去了。</p>
<p>我想，沒有希望了。天下男人都是這樣的，我去嫁　？</p>

<p>有人僱一個廚司，揩油手段極高，無論做什麽菜，多少總得揩一些油方稱心。主人雖然知道，却也無法可想。一天，主人親自去買了半斤醬肉，又親自切開，仔細數過，一其三十二塊，然後送進廚房去加醬油。心裏以為，這樣，大約不致再出毛病。後來送上桌來，點點數目，不多不少，還是三十二塊，但是分量却大減。每塊都被廚司切去了一點，感嘆之餘，做了一首詩，以記其事。詩曰：</p>

<p>韓青天，這位嚮往於十八世紀政治理論與技術的人物雖然做夢也　住包龍圖四部曲：私訪民隱，夜審戶匪，梟首示衆，大快人心。但對於「新法」，他也不甘落後。就拿一訓話」一門說，便樂此不倦。除了每星期一的紀念週，一定表演之外，其他一有機會，難得施展。靑天識字雖不太多，每次的演稿，都貝秘書繕寫得清清楚楚：字體要端正，大，而且大衆　。如果間或再有六分之一或七分之一的字不識靑天的語，那可要佩服靑天跟秘書牙牙學語，苦記的工夫了。</p>

<p>— 勞揚上尉著　楊肇譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　德美航線的快輪『凱隆齊柏號』，載着六百萬金條，開向德國去，邱克斯船公司的無綿電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅，一個他們以前救過的人……</p>
<p>「正是他。可是他跑到這　來幹嗎？我以為他正在法國組織空軍呢。」</p>
<p>不一會兒，他們就親熱地和那個矮小的法國人握着手。他，做着許多手勢，扭着鬍子，表示他是多麽快樂，遇見這兩個救過我性命的勇敢孩子。</p>
<p>『我們眞想不到會遇見你，』傑克說。『我們不知道你在美國。』</p>
<p>小法國人聳聳肩，偷偷地向四週探了一眼。很秘密似的輕聲說：</p>
<p>「除了我的政府之外，沒有人知道我在這裏。」</p>
<p>『你是負着什麽密秘的使命吧？』傑克問。</p>
<p>『若是我吿斥了你們，我在美國幹些什麽，你們肯替我保守秘密嗎？』</p>
<p>「當然，但是，你若不願意——我並不是要尋根究底。」傑克連忙說。</p>
<p>『這就行了，我的朋友！』魯蒙加羅說。『你救過我的性命，若是我瞞着你，我就成了不够朋友。我來美國，是替法國購買和運送飛機的。』</p>
<p>『不過，我想法國已經老早有很充足的空軍了呀。』比爾說。</p>
<p>『很久以前，我們就需要更多的飛機。。』他說。「我希望我們能再增加一倍，不過，現在，我不能多說，我勸你們還多聽聽無綫電吧！你們是出來遊現的嗎？</p>
<p>『正是，我想我們該能有一個快活的假期。』傑克說。</p>
<p>法國人的囘答，是聳肩的一笑。</p>
<p>「你們的假期，恐怕只是你們美國人所謂的「熱望」了」，他這含意深長的話，那兩個靑年却莫明其妙。</p>
<p>二　宣戰了</p>
<p>『好的，傑克雷德，你眞喜歡看我工作？』</p>
<p>問話的是海斯飽佛，一個黃頭髮，紅面頰，「凱隆伯齊號」船上的無線電員。在船開航後的第三天下午，傑克發現和海斯鮑佛是以前會過面的，他們重新交起朋友來。鮑佛最大的高興，却是，在船開航的第一天，這個德國無線電員的機器，出了點毛病，幸虧傑克帮他修理好了。</p>
<p>自從那時起，傑克差不多將大部份的時間，都消　在無線電室裏，表面似乎是像鮑佛所說的，『看我工作。』其實，在他對於無線電原有的興趣之外，另外還有一件事，使他要鎭日守在「凱隆伯齊」的無線電室裏。</p>

<h3 id="c45">學反 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 方愷</p>
<p>學「反」的「反」，不指「造反」的「反」，也不指「舉一　反三隅」的「反」。而指「反對」的「反」，「相反」的「反」。蓋世間事，有正有反，有時正不可用，只得用反，或有時正極必反。因此，如怡碰機會，大用其反，則求人可得歡心，謀事可操左券，殺人不要抵命，發財不費舉手。識得此中三昧，對爲人處世，極有用處，反之意義大矣哉！</p>
<p>從前談過一個笑詁，說哥哥手裏有塊糖，對弟弟說：「如果猜得到手裏有什麽，就把這顆糖送你吃。」那時我以爲此公太笨，非笑他不可，到後來才懊懊此笑大爲不當，原來他手裏有沒有糖，書中沒有說起，我也無從知道。如果不幸他手粵並沒有糖，他就是世界上頂聰明的人了，笑他的人就是世界上頂笨的人了。因爲他無糖而言有糖，是反也。如此不但給他的令弟猜不到，我想拿給天下十六萬萬人猜遍，恐怕還沒有人說他眞的沒有糖吧。他爲天下之大智可知。</p>
<p>再如各店正在大减價，大賤賣，狂賤，拍賣，贈送，猜獎，弄得十分熱鬧，人人都看得厭了。你來個，向來實事求是，不以折扣號召」，你一面旣可藉「不以折扣」之「號召」而「號召」，而人家來買，要你便宜，你就可指　廣告說，「不以折扣號召自然沒有折扣，本店實事求是，遠非他家所能比。且大丈夫一言旣出，駟馬難追，」如此你的名利加收，一舉兩得，此更顯得出「反」的用處之大。</p>
<p>由此觀之，反可使你成大智，獲名利，用處極大，所以我們旣然活在世上做人，讀書，辦事，吃飯，睡覺，便不得不學一上反。上面己經講過，反可得歡心，可操左券，不要抵命，不要舉手，因此趁耿之先生在扮倡「學乖」，「學推」等等之際，我也來一套「事反」。</p>
<p>醫如某人不通，你可說他「博學」；某人慳吝，你可說他，慷慨」；某人呆笨，可稱之曰「誠實」，某人不顯，你可說「久聞大名如雷貫耳，關河修阻，奉謁無由。」某人　癲，可稱之日「高尙滑稽」，上足媲美淳干髡，西門豹，下足追踪卓別麟，韓蘭根，並說如太史公在世，當爲你編入列傳。總之，你可隨機應變，神而明之，橫豎只碧略掉口舌之勞，別　說你好，自己又可做一筆體面人情，如加上一句「向來實事求是，不吹別人」，那價値更偉大了。</p>
<p>再者，你在放屁，儘可用手巾替自己掩鼻，你想殺人，個可說自己也在被殺之列：自己在胡親，也可說自己將受累，如此一反，你卽無罪，不但罪孽可推，而於惟之外且可藉此弄人。這不包「學推」之內，故另此一提。同待你想刮錢，可以廉潔自鳴，你想雙管齊下，偏說兩邊都不弄：想做蝙蝠，可說做四不像以省事；你想去做通事，也可說爲吸牧文化；甚至討異國老婆，亦可謂減少異國人口，使其人力缺乏；在某處服務，可謂吸牧異國資本，收歸國有，使其財力枯　。故　國可稱愛國，求和可稱救民，諸如此類，亦不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>你旣如此一反，如適得其反，衆必信汝。只要你說得娓娓動聽，洋洋盈耳，頭頭是道，大家一定覺得唯你獨尊，無可疑養，且可把你的話奉作眞理，編入四書五經。因世界之上　只你是一等聰明，且只此一家，並無分出，人家非大愚亦卽中愚，非中愚亦卽小愚，你之聰明，世罕其匹，自生民以來未有之也。故反不可不知，不可不學，不可不習，如果知而能行，學而能習知，則可不亦樂乎，皇無疑養。</p>
<h3 id="c46">沒有字的豐碑 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>這是一個幾深的山谷，潮濕，晦　，沒有人聲，沒有腳步，壁上的石乳點滴着淙淙的水泉，混和着綠色的苔鮮。如墨的深夜。彷彿我視覺特殊滯頓，我不能用眸子柔毛的柄刷拂拭那些堆積得厚厚的灰塵。</p>
<p>茫然，我凝思，凝思，透過那高高的罅　，像白鷺飛，飛向靑天的深處。迴翔大千中　浮雲做了我的脚墊踏上層層的雲，我昇向高天</p>
<p>並不寂寞。我沒有行旅人慣常的寂寞，昏燈下孤館的凝情，老樹昏鴉古道旁的歎息。一段長途的旅行並不使我煩悶。在層層穹蒼下，我讀着一段段長長的故事。故事　明在一座豐碑上。一段故事，長長的，也許就無盡。我永遠讀不完。他證明人生。他也就是人生。故事複雜的，但只有一段，這像人生，在宇宙只有一幅。奮鬥的，再生的，創造的，美麗的，光榮的，在　故事裏面都吿訴我們了。雕刻在白雲山上，星斗上，太陽和月亮上，這些是豐啤，沒有字的豐碑。</p>
<p>該說這豐碑是與天齊高的，往往一個誠心而有勇氣看啤的人，他常能能够發現碑高的無極。　上一層雲。脚下冉多添一層絨墊。一個自由的旅行者，他不斷的可以看見這豐碑。平壁出海日，空中聞天鷄，卽使於微茫參井間，你上豋靑　之高天，你也還可以得到這沒字碑文與你作　。它决不在你的脚下，它比你更高，比日月，比星斗，比白雲。你續了，你感動，你流淚，寂寞的歡快，萎靡的推盪，掙折的安慰，沈迷的驚覺。</p>
<p>彷彿這許多故事是你最熱悉的。它也是一段人生，說明人生，說明奮鬥的成功，正義的歸宿。這故事打動你，使你了解人生，使你知道人生祇有奮鬥。一部壯烈的故事，你讀了，感動於碑中人，復悼念他們的壯烈。故事興你也彷徘，你流過淚。塗抹過碑文，埋下　　做過你的碑脚，現在你又讀到另一座更大的豐碑，你將不能分辨這是爲你的感動，還是碑中人的悼惜。你很熟習碑中的故事，偉大處你心肺開張，痛快處使你拍案叫絕，碑中人的哀號，是你的眼涙，憤恨是你的詛咒。歡笑是的展顏。你能於靜寂中數着萬千人心脈的跳動，口鼻的呼吸。碑上原無宇，但你不能不驚訝無宇的魔力了。憤怒的爪撕過你的胸踊，侮辱亦於你心上運過大椎，一幅芳草的平原在你眼前展開，許多賽　的敎訓，又一一種在　的記憶裏。你往往於驚訝間，不知不覺間。默誦碑文間，你痛哭，流涕，遇險，掙扎，終又驚覺，猶疑，取决，坦然，你推　枕頭，蔑視夢中的小醜。這時，初日照高林……</p>
<p>陪着伴我們，衝破天空走出夢境，張開羽翼，我們有勇氣，我們不寂寞。譬如吧，我們的旅行是體驗一段奮鬥的人生，而豐碑則是前驅者給發們的路標和鞭策，他是一段過往，說明犧牲與成功。他也是人生，給我們人生以印證。</p>
<p>沒有淸廟的歌詩，沒有　梭的奇字，沒有覆蓋的深簷，你不必關心霖兩的侵濕，燒集的野火，狂牛的　角，沒有一個字，然而他寫下千萬年來人類的鬥爭，黑暗與光明，圓顏與猛獸，卑鄙與崇高。沒有一個半　符號。然而他使人感動，使人流淚，勝史，只使人感到煩瑣和虛　，呆　像機械，腐敗像朽木。你因此會更讚揚豐碑，活鮮鮮的人生，有血，有奮鬥，有成功，有犧牲，有壯烈，領導了你，也說明你了。你因感動而反應　你的人生也就變成豐碑。給豐碑說明，給人類贊頌，他像嚴師，攆正你，批駁你，敎訓你，又　密友，依傍你，陪伴你，帮助你。當你振翼搏風時，你須要豐碑領　和鼓動，來完成你的自由的飛翔。完成你的自由的飛翔，像過往的碑中人。從奮「到不朽，在碑上寫下古往與今來。</p>
<p>你默誦，桔人家鼓舞；你奮睛，給人謳歌。</p>
<p>雕刻在白雲上　星斗上，太陽和月亮，這些是豐碑，沒有字的豐碑，</p>

<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>三、如此重人</p>
<p>第三天的淸晨，天空才放出魚肚色，我們便從黑暗和客棧裏底骯髒的棉被裏爬起來，把手巾放進湯碗般大的臉盒裏　着水，粗粗洗過　臉就抉着行李　出了客棧，爬上卡車去了。一片灰白的霜霧籠罩着周遭，呼呼的　風刺着我們的心肺，大家都　縮得像一個蝸牛，蹲在車上，他們鼻子上滴滴地掉下來的鼻水，表明了他們所愛的冷氣。司機還沒有來——恐怕還沒有起床，其實客人就沒有必要這麽早就爬上車來呆等，受冷，無奈中國人私心太大，總是很早就競相爬上車去，霸佔着很好的位子坐着，使後來的人，沒有地位可以挿足，于是大家也只好競相搶坐了。</p>
<p>大家你搶我奪，嘰哩咕嚕吵了好一會兒，太陽已在東方的山峰上准糾糾地露出臉龐來了，穿着草黃色棉制服的司機和壓車人，還帶點睡眠不足似地從客棧裏走出來，客人的心情才舒暢了一下：車就可以開出了。</p>
<p>司機和壓車的伙計合力上了汽油，檢杳　機件，然後他們倆都跳上了車，卜卜卜的把馬達開起來，正準備要開走，而向客人問道：</p>
<p>「客人都來齊了嗎？」</p>
<p>「來齊了。」客人同聲答道。</p>
<p>這　瞬間，却從街對面威風澟凜地來了一個軍人，揚手叫道：</p>
<p>「我要坐你們這個車。」</p>
<p>他穿草黃絨軍衣，披皮大敞，年紀約在四十五上下，面頰組黑，兩眼微突，呈露　　兇相，佩短劍，帶手槍，但未扣領章，不知其什麽階級。一部卡車，除了滿載行李外，還坐看二十四位客人，本來就已毫無立錐之地了。所以客人聽到他說要坐這部車，大家都本能地同聲答道：</p>
<p>「坐不下了。」</p>
<p>他裝做沒有聽見，仍是向車子走來。走近車傍，想要爬上云了。客人又說：</p>
<p>司機見到車子實在已無法再坐得下一個人，而且乘客又一致的拒絕他坐，於是跳下車來，對那軍人說：</p>
<p>「車子實在坐不下了，請你坐第二部車吧。」</p>
<p>「我把錢你吧。」</p>
<p>軍人己經開始生氣，從袋裏摸出一張十元鈔票向司機擲去，一壁自己就想爬上車去。司機是二十五歲左右的年靑人。火氣也很盛，忙答道：</p>
<p>「客人給幾十塊錢都買不到票，你要坐車，上公司裏買票去吧。我們這裏是沒有票賣的。」（未完）</p>

<p>— 徐靑</p>
<p>夜，降臨到我的室裏，空氣沉悶得像古墓。</p>
<p>淡弱的燈光，把我的影子映在牆上，像一頸松，　瘠，髪亂，我慘笑了一下，我知道我很寂寞。</p>
<p>門輕輕地在響。</p>
<p>進來的是個年靑的明友，沉默着，不速之客似地，於是我儘量地記憶，他的名字，他的籍買與個性簡直使我記不起來了，而惟一的解答就是他是我的朋友。他用敏銳的目光掃射了我一下，似乎已看出了我的疑問。</p>
<p>「朋友！你連我也忘記了麽？」</p>
<p>他的語氣使我更感到熟悉。</p>
<p>「眞的，請恕我健忘！」我歉然地說。</p>
<p>「那麽你該記得兩年前的事吧！短短的兩年阿！都市生活把你的記憶都糜爛了麽？」</p>
<p>我記起來了，他眞是我的親熱的朋反，兩年前他更年靑，善於談笑，而今他憔悴了，臉上黑黑的，頭髮很長，像一束野草。</p>
<p>「這好多日子來，你在那裏呀？」</p>
<p>「我！我在拉　」微笑在陰暗的臉上開了光輝。</p>
<p>「拉　！你不覺　苦嗎？」</p>
<p>「你太呆了，你不知道痛苦後的收穫嗎？」他格格地笑了起來，一面脫下衣服，露出了兩個黎黑的肩膀，嘮上一條一條相叉的繩痕，從青色中透出紫色。</p>
<p>「呀！多美麗的烙印呀？」我驚呼起來。「我們有許多人拉着一條巨大的船，從急湍的水灘裏，從多礁的山峽裏拉遇。沒有　也沒有夜，歷盡了風雪與炎炎的太陽。你要知道，幹了一椿困難而偉大的事情，那是一種聖　呢！」</p>
<p>他一邊說一邊做着拉的姿勢，我覺得我的桌子在動了，我的房間也動了，這世界也動了。</p>
<p>「聖蹟—聖蹟—偉大的聖蹟—」</p>
<p>「朋友，別太興奮，工作還未完哩！正這我們的船太舊了一點，得　緊修理，好，我要走了！」</p>
<p>迅速地，連抓也抓不住，他就去了。</p>
<p>他去了。</p>
<p>我的心頭勇起了浪潮，這小房間再也關不住我了，我跳了起來，把一枝筆猛力地拋出去：</p>
<p>「幹呀，拉起祖頃的　索來！」</p>

<p>— 李月欽</p>
<p>晨種體育會徵募運動追記</p>
<p>一個薄幕的黃昏，在一所陳　的樓上，橫排着兩條板凳，上面緊挨着九個晨鐘體育社慰勞東江將士徵募運動的籌備委昌，每個人帶着一副嚴肅緊張的面孔，「怎樣擴大慰勞工作」的問題，貫通着九個人的心坎，一齊精邃地思索着。</p>
<p>熱烈的討論，在主席宣布開會宗旨後開始了，緊張的空氣，籠罩着整個會場，窒息着每個人的呼吸，擴大徵募慰勞品運動，成爲問題的中心。</p>
<p>一个穿着陰丹士林長袍的女工，用着很堅毅的聲音發言了：</p>
<p>「爲要使這次徵募運動，能够獲得更大的成績，和各廠主聯絡，以取得各方面的援助和方便，是很必要的。」</p>
<p>她的有力的聲調，吸住了每一條的視線，</p>
<p>緊接着，又是另一個重要的提議：</p>
<p>「我們應該把這徵募運動深入羣衆，變爲　衆自覺的行動，因此，怎樣提高羣衆工作高度的熱情，是不容我們忽視的，我以爲，進行徵募慰勞品運動的競賽，是提高羣衆熱情的重要步驟」。</p>
<p>這兩個重要的提議，立刻獲得了全體的同意。</p>
<p>工作决定了，每個社員的心，都是異常的活　，他們有着堅强的共同信念：只要他們努力地幹下去，優良的成績，一定會爲他們所獲得。</p>
<p>翌晨，陽光吻着××織造廠陳舊的招牌，却沒有機會迎接正在熱烈徵募慰勞品的人兒，工廠里圍繞着五六百個男女工友，每一條視線，都被洪亮的演講聲音所吸住。</p>
<p>一個演講員立正着，多麽有力的聲音，激動着每個人的心情：</p>
<p>「……我們工友的生活是够苦的！但我們在淪陷區里的同胞，却更過着猪狗不如的悲慘生活：　　　　　　　　×和××，他們是我們親愛的同胞，還有着我們的父母妻子，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　的　　——在前線抗戰的將士，那一個不是爹娘養的，不是爲着拯救那些無辜的同胞，保衛中華民埃，他們拋棄了家庭，去和×人戰鬥。　　　　　　　　　　　……」</p>
<p>每句話都是激昂有力的打進五六百個工友的心坎，呼吸是那麽短促而窒息，一幅血腥圖畫在他們眼里閃爍，一種緊張的情緒，緊迫着他們的肺腑，不，他們是那麽堅毅，同胞們的慘痛，深刻地銘刻在他們的腦海里，</p>
<p>「我捐毛巾半打，」「喂，這裏牙刷一打！」「還有我捐四亳，」聲音是那麽麽哄鬧。</p>
<p>「我也捐……」一位曾做廠主和管工的工友　　　　他的　　。</p>
<p>就在這樣踴躍，献捐的下面，開闢了工廠有史以來光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>宣傳員顯露着微笑的臉，他們深深地爲工友的獻捐所感動，同樣的，廠主的賢明，肯於撥出三十分鐘的工作時間，以方便募募慰勞品的推行，也使他們異常的感激。</p>
<p>膠鞋毛巾藥品堆積在牆的東面的一僩角落里，好像古代埃及的金字塔，但因人們忙碌磊疊堆下的緣故，于是也就顯出什亂而不穩固，可是人們每晚却照例這樣的疊磊，一直繼續到深夜。</p>
<p>這樣大規模的徵募，不僅獲得許多比絞落後的下層民衆的獻捐，而且有些工廠工友還自動發起一仙運動，甚至有的還要求將過去九五扣下購救債剩下的錢轉献給前線將士。</p>
<p>這是多麽令人感動的一頁，在香港的救運巨潮里，晨鐘體育會是以突擊的新姿態出現在人們的面前！</p>
<p>經渦了抗戰二，三個多月　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，居然不同了，尤其是下層民衆，他們已揮動了自己的力量，爲着民挨解放而鬥爭！</p>

<h3 id="c87">保盧平日的生活 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>抗戰前他就在虹橋飛機場工作　全運會時曾在演過電影「海葬」　此次突來噩耗未知是真還是假抗戰的大旗、在中國五千年的泥土上、發若異樣光輝的時候、各省各地的熱血靑年、都背上槍桿、胃着砲火、開拔到前綫去了。</p>
<p>抗戰的歌聲、響徹了每一個冷落的鄉村、銹爛的槍桿與刺刀都被擦得雪亮冒着火光。</p>
<p>這時候、各層階級的人、男的和女的、都投身軍戎、尤其是智識分子、他們都丟開了驟本、投奔到軍隊裏去。</p>
<p>體育界則有許多著名的選手如「小黑灰」陳鎭和、撑竿跳大王符保盧、全運撑高跳第二名王禾等、都加入了中國的空軍、爲國效勞、</p>
<p>這些著名運動選手的加入空軍、不單顯示了中國國民優秀份子參加抗戰、同時更說明、他們不僅僅是「運動明星」而且也是參加全國抗戰最能戰鬥的一員、</p>
<p>日前本報載符保盧在桂林參加空戰殉難的惡耗、這不幸的消息、我們希望只是一個謠傳、現在讓我吿訴談者一點關於這位空軍戰士平日的生活、</p>
<p>符保盧、生成一頭棕色的捲髮、瘦削的但顯得精神很詢滿的咀臉、咀上留着一點小鬍髭、個子並不很高、但很結實、</p>
<p>他的個性很暴燥、但却異常爽直、</p>
<p>他從小就生長在哈爾濱、父親是東北人、母親是俄國人、他家庭裏還有一個弟弟、和兩個妹妹、現在他們全家都在上海、在霞飛路開着一家參行</p>
<p>符保盧也因爲這個關係、不單說得一口純熟的俄國話、同時也能說一口流利的英文、</p>
<p>如若你不知道符保盧身世的、你會在她身上、發見一種異國的風味、也會許你猜想他不是中國人、但是、在朋友中間、或是在馬路上、有人假如冒冒失失地說他是俄國人、他一聽見馬上會生氣、甚至不惜動手打你、至少得和你說個明白他是中國的哈爾濱人、</p>
<p>符保盧很喜歡喝酒、喝酒以後、性子有時很粗魯、但是、他心地很良善、在戰事以前、他在虹橋飛機場任事、有一次他酒喝得半醉、開着汽車、帶着金燄等許多朋友、用了五六十碼的速度開到虹僑飛機場去、半路上險和另一部卡車相撞、嚇得全車的人幾叫起來、</p>
<p>他曾經娶過一個很漂亮的俄國老婆、後來兩個人分開了、他常常一暍醉酒、就想他這位外國太太、神經質的流着眼淚、等他醒過來、朋友們便羞着他、</p>
<p>在全國運動會的時候、那時王禾想和符保盧爭一個撑高跳的首席、那天晚上、主禾翻來覆去的睡不着覺、（他曾經囘上海一次、現在又囘到空軍去了、）但符保盧到第二天、還是爭到個首位、實際上、符保盧到並不怎麼苦練、有人說、符保盧假如能够再下點苦功、那麽世界運動會中、不致「榜上無名」的。</p>
<p>符保盧也曾嘗過電影滋昧、那時王斌在天一公司、自已寫了一個劇本呌　海葬」的、决定請符來主演、另外還有劉利影諸人合演這張影片、</p>
<p>那時符保盧確忙得可以、白天上全運會、晚上拍「海葬」後來這張影片在全運會還沒有結束以前、曾在新光大戲院上映、</p>
<p>中國軍隊西撤以後、他也離開了上海、想不到竟傳來這樣意外的惡耗、我們只有　福着、這位空軍戰士依然無恙吧、</p>
<h3 id="c88">從古代希臘談到奧林匹克運動會的種種 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 丁勞</p>
<p>—一段珍貴的體育史—</p>
<p>奧林匹克競技會的起源</p>
<p>希臘的國民大祭Nationae　Bestivals對於體育有極大的貢獻、因他們以競技饗神爲國家最隆盛的典禮、在紀元前六世紀的前半期、有四種競按底大祭、卽Pythia匹替阿Lsthmia伊斯明Nemea泥米亞Oegmpia奧林匹亞其中以奧林匹亞爲巨擘、關於奧林匹亞競技會的起源、有的說、Lghtu王爲保持希臘全島和平向Zeus（爲希臘最高之神）祝福的、有的說、Hleracle紀念其父Zcus滅怪族的、有人主張與啟欖樹神有密切關係、有人根據詩人Pfndcr所設關於戀愛事件的、衆說紛紜、莫衷一是這樣推究奧林匹克競技會的起源、都不過由砷話的傳說罷了、其實、希臘因地理的關係、分割成許多城市小國、爲維持和平計、所以組織了規模宏大的宗敎同盟的競技會、至於競技會的創始者爲誰、在當時雅典底演說家已經無從證明、卽古代稱爲詩聖的荷馬Homero所作的史詩中、也沒有明確的記述及祭典的起源、僅僅說及祭典時、四方健兒雲集、及其成績紀錄而己、據考古學家所說、最近發掘英林匹克競技場底祭殿、至少總在紀元千年以前、故最初主宰此會的、不是强橫霸道的陀利亞Donja人、却是沒有勢力的伊力期Elis人、迨至Lusgns制定憲法時、始規定奧林匹亞競技優勝者作爲希臘底年法、故紀元前七百七十年、第一次賽跑競技的優勝者名叫Koredos歷史家就把他當作希臘歷史的紀元、</p>
<p>奧林匹克原是一個村名、在希臘南端的Peloponesus半島、島西有伊力斯Elis小國、從Ioniac海岸有流入一條Alph　eas河、河邊有奧林匹亞村、村與海相隔十哩村的丘上有Zeus神殿祭殿及墳墓、其中安置看希臘彫刻最偉大的、</p>
<p>Zeus像　其他諸神的墳墓、神像英雄像、優勝者底像、以及市民底可賓貴的貢獻物、都放在祭殿裏、神宛的東壁外面爲競技場與競馬場、每次祭時集合了各國底健兒、互相競技、各顯身手、爲奉事神祈國家唯一的大典、因在奧林匹亞中底祭殿前競技的故稱其會爲Olymoic　Gunes而且每四年開大會一次、在四年之閒叫作Tiympiad，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Political Workers in the Battlefield in Northern Jiangxi <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Sent by Wei Chu from the Frontlines of Northern Jiangxi</p>
<p>At the end of March, while the Japanese were attacking Nanchang on one front, they divided their forces to successively occupy Fengxin and Gao'an, and continued to aggressively invade westward. We had just rushed to the border of Gao'an and Fengxin when we received the task of blocking the Japanese forces. On the afternoon of the 30th, our vanguard troops engaged in a bloody battle with the Japanese. The division commander immediately gave us an urgent task: to mobilize the masses to organize stretcher teams and set up casualty transport stations, to transport the wounded as quickly as possible. Although most of the civilians on the front lines had fled, mobilization was extremely difficult, but we accepted the task without hesitation and set off overnight. Our destination was Xiao Fang, a village more than ten miles away from the division headquarters.</p>
<p>The civilians had all run away, making it difficult to even find a guide. After a long time, we finally managed to find an old man. At first, he was very afraid and unwilling. We first gave him two dimes and assured him that we would give him a pass to return home the next day, which made him happy to lead us. The road we took was all small hills and woods. Without a guide, it would be difficult to find our way even during the day, let alone at night.</p>
<p>The sound of artillery fire from the front lines became increasingly tense. The bright moonlight illuminated the long sky and earth flashing with bloody rain.</p>
<p>Xiao Fang was quietly hiding in the embrace of dense trees. We arrived late at night, and the first problem to solve was finding the civilians. We started knocking on doors, but some places were already empty before you even knocked, while others we knocked and shouted for a long time without a response. This made us anxious. We searched all over the village, but still had no results. At the same time, a dark cloud was advancing across the sky, with flashes of lightning, threatening a heavy rain. In our urgency, we realized that we had to cherish this guide. Political work had to start with him.</p>
<p>"Bang, bang, bang..." We knocked, but there was still no response.</p>
<p>"Uncle! Uncle! Please open the door."</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Thank goodness, the reply from inside the door was in the local dialect.</p>
<p>"It's XXX, from XXX place, wanting to ask for a place to stay for the night."</p>
<p>"Why come here so late at night?" a middle-aged man's voice asked.</p>
<p>"Going to carry things for the army... hurrying back, but it's too late," the guide replied, showing his resourcefulness.</p>
<p>"Uncle! Weren't there soldiers banging on doors in the village just now?" a woman's voice asked.</p>
<p>"They're gone, they're gone, they've left the village," the guide replied, making a face at us.</p>
<p>As soon as the door opened, they immediately wanted to close it again when they saw us, but we had already squeezed in. The house was dark, with only an old woman huddled in a corner, trembling. We gently put down our things and slowly went up to her and said, "Auntie, don't be afraid. We are the anti-Japanese army, here to fight the Japanese and protect you." "Don't worry, our anti-Japanese army doesn't conscript people or disturb you!" One comrade after another spoke to her kindly. At the same time, we asked the guide to help us explain. After a long time, she finally ran out of the dark corner, trembling: "Generals! You are good soldiers, I'm not afraid." Seeing her like that, her fear was still very serious. We lit a lamp and sat down quietly to talk to her gently and kindly, explaining things. Seeing that her fear had subsided a lot, we asked her, "Auntie, where are the rest of your family?" "Generals! They're afraid of airplanes and ran away long ago, leaving only me at home!" She still didn't trust us.</p>
<p>The back door was open, clearly indicating that people had just left. We slipped out to take a look, and saw a cluster of people huddled together on a small hill nearby. "Uncles! Don't be afraid, we're not conscripting!" Before we could finish speaking, the cluster of people desperately scrambled over the hill and left. Helpless, we went back and patiently and sincerely spoke to the old woman. After a long time, she finally trusted us, picked up a lantern, and ran out the back door to shout for a long time. After a while, men, women, and children slipped back one by one, filling the house.</p>
<p>The old woman's son was a young student. We talked to him for a long time, and he finally fully understood us and explained things to his family.</p>
<p>"Oh! Generals: some bad troops in the past scared us badly! If it weren't for my mother calling us back, we would have had to spend the night in the open," a young woman said to us boldly, causing everyone to laugh.</p>
<p>They busied themselves finding door panels and straw for us, boiling water for tea..., and the old lady brought out two plates of peanuts and fried beans from the room. They ate and talked warmly. They had previously been more afraid of us than the King of Hell, but now they saw us as relatives and friends.</p>
<p>The first thing we had to do when we got up was to find the village head. On the front lines, it wasn't easy for troops to find the village head or neighborhood chief. Often, many village heads and neighborhood chiefs would run into you, and when you asked them where the village head was, they would answer, "That doggone guy ran away long ago." Of course, there were many reasons for this, but the main one was that most neighborhood chiefs weren't responsible enough and were afraid of trouble. Secondly, even today, there are still very few troops and individual soldiers who engage in various illegal acts against local authorities.</p>
<p>Led by the son of the family we were staying with, we found the village head directly without any effort. He was a young man, lively and energetic. Although we arrived early, he was already on the phone, dealing with official business.</p>
<p>When we showed him the official document asking him to help mobilize the masses to organize stretcher teams, he agreed without hesitation and immediately wrote official documents to each neighborhood, like a powerful call: "The Japanese devils are attacking our hometown, we must quickly rise up and help the army fight, carry the wounded... there is also a wage of fifty cents a day..." He quickly ordered the public servants to send them out and sent people to notify the neighboring neighborhood chiefs to step up mobilization.</p>
<p>We quietly waited for him to finish handling the official business before starting to talk.</p>
<p>"Oh! It's terrible, I'm simply too busy!" He shook his head, his hair disheveled, his feet bare.</p>
<p>"Village head! You're working too hard!" We offered him a sincere word of comfort.</p>
<p>"How can that compare to you? The Japanese devils are attacking our home, if I don't work hard and help the army, what kind of talk would that be?"</p>
<p>This village head was truly rare. The orders from above were so numerous: destroy the roads, a certain number of civilians needed within a few days, or be beheaded; transport grain, a certain number of civilians needed, or be beheaded; the XXX headquarters needs a certain number of laborers within a few days, or be beheaded. However, many of the farmers in his village had already fled due to the tense situation. The required number of people far exceeded what he could mobilize. However, he said, "I won't run away, I'll do my best, I'm prepared to lose my head... However, it's not right for the higher-ups to put so many things on the shoulders of a few village heads. Why not pursue those village heads who ran away?"</p>
<p>The village head hadn't been paid his living expenses for eight months. Reports and requests were useless. Furthermore, the county magistrate had withheld some of the special expenses for local office expenses stipulated by the province, and it was unknown what they were used for. There were many things that needed to be done locally, but they had to be stopped. As for the family members of soldiers going off to war, it was unknown where those funds had gone. "Ah! Comrades! You don't know the suffering of lower-level administrative personnel! If my family didn't still have a few coins, I would really have to sell my wife to do public service." The village head issued a painful cry to us.</p>
<p>He wanted to lead the local masses to fight a guerrilla war, but he didn't have any guns. Although he had already submitted a request to his superiors.</p>
<p>As we were talking, the village head suddenly picked up the small clock on the table and looked at it. It was almost eight o'clock. He immediately put on his clothes and shoes, and stuck a small gun in his belt. He said straightforwardly, "Please sit and chat, I have to go to the road to take a look at the destruction," and he quickly left.</p>
<p>We busied ourselves finding a house, setting up a transport station, finding straw, preparing stretchers, preparing tea and thin porridge... With the automatic help of a dozen or so civilians, everything was done in a flash. In particular, the host family and their neighbors helped a lot. Even the orderly understood this principle! "Civilians will definitely help us as long as our troops treat them well. Official airs and tempers are unacceptable in front of civilians."</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Developing Jinan Base Area <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Bian</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Trends in Jinan</p>
<p>(Newsletter from the People's Revolutionary Society) Recently, someone returned from the front lines in Hebei, bringing back a lot of news. Because I haven't systematically organized it, I can only write down a few fragments to share with readers who are concerned about the situation in Jinan.</p>
<p>1. The Hardworking Style of Civil Servants</p>
<p>The regimes in Jinan were mostly established after guerrilla units and some regular troops fought countless battles to drive out the Japanese. Therefore, the elected anti-Japanese regimes here particularly maintain a spirit and style of hardship and perseverance. In Nei Qiu County (in the Ji 4 area), government personnel still eat chaff to this day. They make the chaff into cornbread, but they have to eat it while it's hot, otherwise it will scatter into a pile of chaff. This kind of cornbread is their regular food. It doesn't digest easily, and it's very painful when they have a bowel movement.</p>
<p>The situation in Jing Long County's anti-Japanese government is similar. County government officials often have to quickly find food for dinner after eating breakfast.</p>
<p>The county magistrate's monthly stipend is only one yuan (it used to be fifty cents), and the commissioner only gets two yuan, but material difficulties never affect their enthusiasm for work. On the contrary, as the situation in North China becomes more urgent, they show their determination and effort even more.</p>
<p>2. Freely Entering and Exiting the Japanese Blockade Line</p>
<p>The government's arduous struggle and the army's heroic battles have weakened the Japanese forces in Hebei, making the vast majority of people in Hebei realize that China is certain to win in the end. The conditions among the masses are good, providing great convenience to the government and the army.</p>
<p>Government and army personnel can disguise themselves as civilians and take trains to Shijiazhuang and Beijing. The government's cooperatives can go to Shijiazhuang to purchase goods. Even government personnel can return to the Japanese-controlled areas to celebrate the New Year without any problems. This is mainly due to the protection of the masses.</p>
<p>Most of Gao Yi County (on the Pinghan Railway) is in the Japanese-controlled area, but our county government personnel can still carry out their work in plain clothes and implement the anti-war laws of the National Government.</p>
<p>The Pinghan Railway is supposed to be strictly monitored by the Japanese, but with the protection of our people, anyone can freely walk from the east side to the west side, or from the west side to the east side, as long as they wear plain clothes and carry a good citizen certificate (issued by the Japanese, but sometimes they don't even need to carry it). Our troops pass through the blockade line in large numbers. The Japanese sometimes know this, but they can't do anything about it.</p>
<p>3. Puppet Organizations Also Come to Console Us</p>
<p>Here's a very interesting story. This happened in January of this year in XXX County near the Pinghan Railway. Our XXX Army annihilated more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, which greatly excited the local troops. They launched a large-scale consolation movement, and even the people in the Japanese-controlled area donated a large number of pigs and sheep. A county magistrate of XXX County deducted dozens of yuan from his own salary and asked someone from the county seat to send the money to our anti-Japanese army. This story shows that our victory has also deeply moved the internal members of the puppet organizations. We believe that as long as we continue to increase our victories, it will be no problem to win over and disintegrate the puppet organizations.</p>
<p>4. The Japanese Are Our Transportation Team</p>
<p>The telephone lines seen in the Jinan area are all crooked or connected by many lines. It is said that these were all given to us by the Japanese. The telephone lines of the Japanese on the Pinghan Railway and other transportation lines are often destroyed by us. We take the telephone lines seized from the Japanese and install them on our own telephone poles. In order to maintain communication, the Japanese have to repair them frequently, but the more diligent the Japanese are in repairing, the more diligent we are in destroying. As a result, the Japanese telephone lines are continuously given to us.</p>
<p>The trains on the Pinghan Railway are also often attacked by us, so the Japanese have to send us some gifts.</p>
<p>5. The Anti-Japanese Base Area in Western Ji is Expanding</p>
<p>On the map, you can see a narrow strip west of the Pinghan Railway and east of the Taihang Mountains. This is the anti-Japanese base area in western Ji. The area north of the Zhengtai Railway belongs to the Chaji Border Region, and the area south belongs to the Jinan Administrative Region. What I am talking about here is the southern part.</p>
<p>The Ji Xi base area was built from scratch, but it has made rapid progress in the past year or so.</p>
<p>Fair burden has begun to be implemented, the Senate has also begun to be established, and the masses are becoming more and more sound and consolidated. The government has been able to achieve unified planning and distribution, and the organization has become more and more consolidated. The atmosphere in Ji Xi is very active. The consolidation and expansion of Ji Xi has a great effect on the development of the Ji Nan Administrative Region.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Children's Groups in Guilin <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Jiang</p>
<p>(Guilin Newsletter) Children are the new life of the new China, and they are the symbol of the new China.</p>
<p>Now, they are raising their small feet and kicking over the past adult's underestimation of "children", refuting the idea of "who says we are young" with facts, proving the power of children with action. Fan Zheng, a twelve-year-old child from the New Fourth Route Army, wrote articles in the "National Salvation Daily" that were as experienced as an adult's, describing the power of children. Bai Jiansheng's nine-year-old daughter, Bai Xianhui, conducted a children's choir at a concert. Children can also do some of the things that adults do. "Each generation is stronger than the last" - this belief rolls in the minds of adults, and at the same time, it moves some unmotivated adults.</p>
<p>The "Children's Troupe," which grew up during the "August 13th Incident," and the "New Fourth Route Army," which practiced Tao Xingzhi's educational theory of "life is education, society is school," after arriving in Guilin, the collective living, working, and education of these children influenced the children of Guangxi. Their initial union was at the Guangxi Children's Song and Ballad Conference last December. In helping Guangxi children organize song and ballad conferences, they found that the organization of Guangxi children was insufficient. The Party Department hoped that they would strengthen the organization of Guangxi children. From then on, the "Old Brother" Children's Corps had a great influence on the children of Guilin. And they really looked like an "Old Brother", loving and leading, so that Guangxi children could work, live, and study in an organized way, and exert the power of children to help adults fight the Japanese.</p>
<p>Among the six children's corps in Guilin, the earliest established was the "Children's Work Corps of the Guangxi Provincial All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association". This children's corps has a short history and is enthusiastically doing children's salvation work under the guidance of the current Kuomintang Party Department. It is a pity that there is not much funding, and it is not easy to carry out work.</p>
<p>However, the children all live at home, and collective living, working, and learning is impossible. This is the shortcoming of all children's corps in Guilin. It's not that the children are greedy for their parents' love. If you don't believe it, I can quote what the children of the "Children's Education Corps" shouted: "We really envy you (the New Fourth Route Army), everyone lives together, learns together, works together, runs together, how happy that is!" to explain. Their difficulty is that the daily supplies for dozens of small bellies cannot be regularly raised. However, although they do not live together, the spirit of work is still tense. When work is assigned to the children, no one says "Mom won't let me go" or makes excuses to shirk responsibility. They braved the heavy rain to go to Daxu, thirty miles away from Guilin, to promote and comfort the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>In the work, they gained encouragement and confidence. A child in charge of life guidance at the Children's Work Corps said: "Some wounded soldiers don't follow the rules and scold the people, but they are very nice to us children. When we criticize them, those wounded soldiers can listen to us, and even ordinary people are close to us." This is the greatness of the power of children.</p>
<p>In addition to the Children's Work Service Corps and the Children's Education Corps, there are also the Zhongshan Memorial School Children's Wartime Service Corps, the Guangxi Children's Welfare Institute Salvation Work Team, the New Fourth Route Army, and the "New Journey" Southwest Work Team. The former two are naturally prominent in the Guilin Children's Corps because of their activity. The latter two are the "Old Brothers" of the Guilin Children's Corps, playing a leading and influential role in work, life, and learning. In order to have a general leadership organization for the Guilin Children's Corps, the "Guilin Children's Corps Symposium" was organized. In addition to discussing the distribution and planning of propaganda work, current affairs, and foreign activities, the most important thing was to solve and discuss the difficulties encountered by the various children's corps in organization, leadership, work, life, and learning. They also compile the "Anti-War Children" weekly magazine. After Mr. Bai Jiansheng invited them to watch the Soviet film "The Great Turning Point," the symposium wrote a letter to Director Bai to express their warm gratitude and put forward their specific feelings in the letter. When watching the film, Director Bai taught his children to learn from them, which shows his love for these children.</p>
<p>They are so brave that they launched the "Ten Thousand Yuan Children's Fundraising Movement" in Guilin this year on Children's Day. The "New Journey" children plan to write a book on "The Theory of the Chinese Children's Movement", which is divided into four sections: organization and theory, and the present and the future. Because the work scope of the "New Journey" is dispersed, Zeng Zhaoshou, a herding boy from Jiangbei - a child in their group - used old radio equipment to configure a radio transceiver to communicate with work teams scattered everywhere. The children in charge of the "New Journey" need to develop their interests and talents, and support him as much as possible, no matter how difficult the economy is.</p>
<p>Outside of Guangxi, there are the "Refugee Children's Team" led by Mr. Tian Han in Changsha; there are the most in Nanchang, including the Children's Troupe of the Thirty-second Army; eight youth corps, twelve children's corps based in schools; the Children's Troupe of Anyuan Rotary Elementary School; the "Anti-War Children's Reading and Doing Association" in Jun County, northern Hubei; the "Anti-Japanese Children's Corps" in Shou County, Anhui, which set fire to granaries; the "New Fourth Army Children's Corps" which rescued children in the occupied area; the "Guangdong Children's Troupe" and the "Qujiang Children's Choir"; the "Three People's Principles Youth Corps" in Guiyang, and many other children's corps that have not been written about, all organized themselves and stood in the child's position to bravely resist the war.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Dare-to-Die Corps in Western Shanxi <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Fu</p>
<p>(Western Shanxi Correspondent) The border between the four counties of Linfen, Xiangling, Yicheng, and Fushan is a mountainous area with overlapping mountains and crisscrossing gullies. It is only twenty miles away from the Datong-Puzhou Railway to the west. It can control the Quyi section of the Qugao Highway to the south. It can cut off Linfu and Chedao to the north. Relying on the rugged terrain to the east, it is possible to completely block the traffic of Yifu. After the Japanese occupied Linfen and Quwo, this area was calm. The Japanese didn't come often. When they came, they would plunder things and leave. But in August of last year, the Dare-to-Die Corps, the Youth Anti-Japanese Forces arrived, and everything became active.</p>
<p>A hundred or so catties of electric wires on the Datong-Puzhou Road would disappear overnight. The spiral nails, iron bars, and sleepers on the railway would be found thrown into the Fen River, lost in the mountains, or missing at dawn. The "Imperial Army" at the Linfen Zhangli, Shicun, and other stations could not go to the countryside. At any time, a sudden bomb would explode in front of them.</p>
<p>After the Japanese learned about the guerrilla forces, they used traitors to scout and carry out sweeps. However, they either missed their target or fired a few shots and shook their heads to retreat back to the city.</p>
<p>The Dare-to-Die Corps became stronger and healthier in the battles. In this small guerrilla area, as a result of activities day and night for a month, the Japanese, after shaking their heads in the sweeps, specially stationed more than a thousand people in the villages along the Datong-Puzhou line from Linfen to Quwo. Soldiers of the Dare-to-Die Corps could suddenly be found anywhere. Therefore, the Japanese had to station troops in any village close to the railway.</p>
<p>Due to the prolongation of the war, the "Imperial Army" did not have much rice to transport. They needed wheat and vegetables. They had to take these things from the countryside. The Japanese often came to villages ten miles away from the railway with a force of two hundred people to plunder. As soon as they looted, someone would report to the Dare-to-Die Corps, who was determined to cut off the Japanese's livelihood. They then set up ambushes, dispersed the Japanese, and returned the looted items to the people.</p>
<p>The Japanese did not dare to leave the villages where they were stationed alone. They were afraid of sudden shots and grenades.</p>
<p>The local people had organized organizations, such as the Sacrificial Alliance, the Farmers' Salvation Association, the Women's Salvation Association, and the Self-Defense Force (which did not leave production). The closer they were to the Japanese-occupied area, the more they adopted secret work methods, and the more they exerted their great power. During the day, if the Japanese swept in, the women and old people would leave, and the young people would offer tea, braving the rain of bullets to send it to the soldiers who were fighting. Those who were injured were carried to the back, and women would take care of them immediately. The Dare-to-Die Corps fought many battles like this here. There was no difference between the Dare-to-Die Corps and the people. The Dare-to-Die Corps relied on the people for help during battles, and after battles, the people who were injured were carried to the Dare-to-Die Corps' rear hospital.</p>
<p>The people kept watch outside the villages at night. The soldiers and the people knew each other well. In the middle of the night, they broke the railway. When they walked to any village, as long as they told a sentry of the Self-Defense Force outside the village and waited for a while, a group of people would come with furniture and follow them to dig up the rails and sleepers.</p>
<p>The close cooperation between the military and the people consolidated this small guerrilla area.</p>
<p>Although it was a small guerrilla area, it had the following effects: it threatened the Datong-Puzhou line, contained the Japanese forces, made the puppet regime only able to exercise power in the city, protected the lives and property of the vast rural people, and made the Japanese unable to occupy Fushan and Yicheng without any concern.</p>
<p>Now that the Japanese are planning to attack the entire southeastern Shanxi, they naturally cannot ignore this small guerrilla area. In mid-to-late February, the Japanese occupied Yicheng and Fushan and began a five-pronged attack (Linfen, Shicun, Yicheng, Xiangshui River, Fushan). The combined army of infantry, cavalry, and artillery numbered more than three thousand people. However, the Dare-to-Die Corps ambushed them at Nanpanqiao, killing more than three hundred Japanese and breaking through the encirclement. In the mountainous area, the Japanese could not stay for long and withdrew after only one day. The Dare-to-Die Corps returned to its original place. With the close cooperation of the military and the people, this small guerrilla area has been consolidated.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Yen Group and the "Huaxing Bank" <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhixuan</p>
<p>Japanese warlords' means of aggression towards China involve both economic and military force. They are hostile to the stability of China's legal tender system. Therefore, they have been scheming to deliberately undermine it for more than a day. Last year, they established a "United Reserve Bank" in North China, issuing "United Reserve Bank" notes without reserves, aiming to drive out legal tender. They also plotted to monopolize trade and resources in China, pulling the "United Reserve Bank" into the yen group. This tactic had some effect in Manchukuo, but in North China, it has clearly failed. Legal tender still maintains its credibility and holds a strong position in North China. Despite repeated attempts to use force to depreciate the value of legal tender, not only has this been resisted, but the value of "United Reserve Bank" notes has plummeted daily. Recently, the market price for "suppressing notes" has been only about 80 cents against legal tender.</p>
<p>The recent sharp decline of the yen in Shanghai, although due to various factors, is also mainly attributable to its connection with "United Reserve Bank" notes. Truly, harming others harms oneself.</p>
<p>Having suffered a setback with the "United Reserve Bank," they recently established the bogus "Huaxing Commercial Bank" in Shanghai. The planned "Huaxing notes" have been decisively severed from the yen, a lesson learned from a great loss. They know that the "Huaxing Bank" has no future, so they simply made a clean break to disassociate themselves. As for its circulation strategy, it is said to be: (1) Designated commodities will be sold exclusively in "Huaxing" currency. (2) "Huaxing" currency will be used to forcibly purchase products from the occupied areas. (3) Transactions will be stipulated to be conducted in "Huaxing" currency. (4) All taxes, postal services, telegrams, telephone, electricity, tap water, and transportation tickets will be paid in "Huaxing" currency. (5) All payments from the puppet regime will be made in "Huaxing" currency. Their intentions are nothing more than: (1) To control trade. (2) To directly collect goods and materials in the occupied areas with "Huaxing" currency. (3) To attempt to disrupt finance in Central China. (4) Because the issuance of Japanese paper money has inflated too much to continue, future military expenditures will be met by issuing unbacked "Huaxing" notes, allowing them to linger on.</p>
<p>The future of the puppet "Huaxing Bank" can be predicted based on the failure of the "United Reserve Bank" in North China. If "United Reserve Bank" notes, linked to the yen, have already plummeted, how much more so the "Huaxing" currency, whose relationship with the yen has been severed? Even if the Japanese side uses Yangtze River commerce as leverage, forcing Britain, the United States, and France to endorse this bogus currency, the fundamental purpose of this bogus currency is to exclude European and American markets in China. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and France will have no reason to accept the bogus currency or support the bogus regime.</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai banking industry, it has already expressed its refusal to accept it, and even small money shops will not exchange it.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a commercial port with an import surplus. The "Huaxing Bank's" attempt to control foreign exchange is even more hopeless, because it has no substantial foreign exchange funds to supply imports. The export foreign exchange it can seize will also be limited. Therefore, it is predicted that the Shanghai foreign exchange market will continue to be controlled by foreign banks.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Six Days of Bloody Battle Annihilated Tens of Thousands – Our Army Wins a Great Victory in Zhongtiao Mountain – The Entire Front in Central Hubei is Silent – Xiang and Gan Are Stable – The Army in Zengcheng and Conghua Was Defeated by Us <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 12th] Since the × (enemy) in southern Shanxi were conquered by our army at the two strongholds of Pinglu and Maojindu, our military prestige has greatly increased, and river defenses are more solidified. We are taking advantage of our victory to sweep away the × (enemy), × (enemy) morale is frustrated, most of them have fled to the north of Zhongtiao Mountain, and a small number have fled to Zhangdian. Currently, there are over two thousand × (enemy) soldiers in the area south of Dachen Village, and over three thousand × (enemy) soldiers south of Xisheng Xia Niu and Zhangdian. Our army is already encircling and attacking them from all directions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 11th] Frontline telephone report, the × (enemy) who have repeatedly attacked Zhongtiao Mountain are the entire 20th Division, led by Ushijima, and half of the newly arrived 37th Division, along with two artillery regiments and a squadron of aircraft, totaling over 30,000 men. According to the × (enemy) side, this is their full-force offensive on Zhongtiao Mountain. However, after six days of bloody battle, the × (enemy)'s casualties have reached over 10,000 men, accounting for one-third of their total force. The number of × (enemy) annihilated has created a new record for battles in North China this year. The statistics of × (enemy) deaths are as follows: (1) From the 7th to the evening of the 8th, the × (enemy) attacked our Dachen Village position with over 200 men. Our ×× Brigade's Zheng Regiment led its troops in a brave resistance. The × (enemy) attacked for two days and one night, but ultimately failed. In this battle, over a thousand × (enemy) were killed, and our position remained unmoved. Zheng Regiment won a glorious victory.

It is estimated that the × (enemy)'s casualties in this offensive will reach 10,000. The captured spoils of war are currently being inventoried. In short, this offensive was the most disastrous the × (enemy) has suffered in their repeated attacks on Zhongtiao Mountain. Previously, Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang of the Second War Area told reporters that Zhongtiao Mountain would be the × (enemy)'s graveyard. The × (enemy) people will regard this as a warning.</p>

<p>[Hai'er News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] According to news from the Japanese side in Nanjing, high-ranking Japanese and puppet officials hosted a banquet to entertain Japanese Vice Minister Shimizu Ryusaburo, but a Chinese person poisoned the wine. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and they immediately had their stomachs pumped by doctors. Now the officials are out of danger. If the poisoning had succeeded, many high-ranking Japanese and puppet officials would have been killed. It is reported that the Japanese side has captured one suspect and is currently interrogating him.</p>
<p>[Chongqing Electricity] Shanghai news, × (enemy) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shimizu Ryusaburo arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and went to Nanjing. The × (enemy) consulate in Nanjing hosted a welcome banquet at 7 p.m. on the 10th. In addition to the unanimous participation of × (enemy) military and political dignitaries, puppet organization leaders Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Ren Yuandao, Ma Cheng, and Gao Guanwu were also invited as escorts, totaling over 20 people. During the banquet, the × (enemy) and puppets clinked glasses and exchanged toasts, appearing extremely harmonious. Unexpectedly, a strong poison was secretly placed in the yellow wine they consumed. After the × (enemy) and puppets drank heartily, they immediately became poisoned and fell to the ground. The order was disrupted for a time, and doctors were urgently summoned for treatment. However, because the poisoning was very deep, they were transported to the hospital. × (enemy) side only released the information on the evening of the 11th, saying that the poison in the wine was placed by anti-Japanese elements, and one person has been arrested. The most severely poisoned were Liang Hongzhi and Gao Guanwu. Although it is rumored that senior military and diplomatic personnel of the × (enemy) side were also involved, no names were mentioned.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Yesterday evening after dusk, multiple Japanese bombers raided the cities of Yu (Chongqing) and Rong (Chengdu) within fifteen minutes. Our fighter planes immediately took off to meet them and engaged the × (enemy) aircraft in fierce combat. As the evening glow gradually closed in, the sky was dim, and the light from the searchlights intertwined in the air. The × (enemy) aircraft took advantage of the vague dusk to break into the urban area. However, because our planes were closely chasing, they hastily dropped their bombs and fled in disarray. The × (enemy) aircraft broke into Chongqing at 7:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. They also appeared over Chengdu. Chongqing suffered dozens of large bombs. The × (enemy) aircraft dropped their bombs without targeting anything. Chengdu had several incendiary bombs dropped, and several houses caught fire. The number of casualties in both places has not yet been ascertained, but it is believed that it is not very large. The × (enemy) aircraft suffered heavier losses in Chengdu, with three being shot down by our aircraft and falling in the southeastern suburbs. Several large fires in the city were only extinguished by the fire brigade until midnight. The West China University, a British church school outside the South Gate, was directly hit by three bombs. It is reported that two foreign faculty members were injured. When the × (enemy) aircraft broke into the sky over Chongqing, they were fiercely fired upon by our army's anti-aircraft gun team. According to eyewitnesses, two × (enemy) aircraft fell from the sky. Their remains are currently being searched for. The remaining × (enemy) aircraft all fled because our aircraft were chasing them. Our aircraft safely returned only after the × (enemy) aircraft were far away.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to encircle the British and French concessions in Tianjin and has ordered that starting from the 14th, all pedestrians entering and leaving the concessions must be searched by Japanese police before being allowed to pass, except for officials of various countries (including the Japanese and puppet regimes). Also, Japanese Consul General Tashiro in Tianjin will officially issue a notice tomorrow, and at the same time advise Japanese residents in Tianjin not to frequently travel to and from the concessions. It is rumored that the Japanese side has adopted this measure because the British Consul General in Tianjin refused to extradite the assassin in the Cheng case.</p>
<p>× (enemy) Spokesman Makes a Forceful Statement</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 12th] According to the Japanese Domei News Agency, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that the British authorities in Tianjin have refused to hand over the assassin of Cheng Xigeng to the Japanese side. The Japanese authorities have decided that they will be forced to take "certain steps" to deal with the new situation arising from this matter. A foreign correspondent requested an explanation of these steps, but the spokesman did not respond, only saying that the British authorities should reconsider their attitude, which is most necessary. Also, according to news from Tianjin, Japanese property in the British and French concessions continues to be moved to areas under Japanese control, but a large amount of goods remain in the concessions. The population of the British concession is 47,000, including 2,700 British citizens. The population of the French concession is 61,000, including 1,000 French citizens. The total population of Tianjin is approximately 1.3 million.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 12th] Chinese newspapers under Japanese management here have many anti-British remarks. Although the British Consul General protested on the 10th of this month, demanding suppression of anti-British propaganda, the anti-British tone of the newspapers has not diminished.

<p>Strengthen Soldiers' Physique Improve Combat Efficiency</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai Correspondence] Many of China's current biochemists and human nutrition experts are assisting military authorities in improving the diet of soldiers. In addition, extremely large warehouses have been established to store grain. It is reported that Chinese experts in dietary issues have explored and formulated a new diet for soldiers to strengthen soldiers' physique and improve their combat efficiency. The components of the new diet are rice flour, wheat flour, eggs, animal fat, soybeans, sugar, and salt. After mixing the ingredients, they are made into biscuits, bread, or hardtack, etc., all of which have extremely high nutritional value. Chemists at the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the National Government are also finding ways to pickle vegetables and plants. It is reported that a total of 55,000 tons are needed annually to supply the warriors at the front. In addition, plans are being made to manufacture a large number of canned foods for military use, so all the major canned food factories in the country are extremely busy.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Nanjing's Large-Scale Elimination of Traitors <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The puppet leaders of Nanjing held a grand banquet on the evening of the 10th to entertain Japanese Vice Minister Shimizu Ryusaburo, but someone poisoned the wine. Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Ren Yuandao, Gao Guanwu, and Shimizu all suffered severe poisoning. This major case of eliminating traitors will surely be "widely welcomed" throughout the country!</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the × (enemy) and traitor leaders can survive, we can see from this fact that the occupied areas, and even the close associates of the × (enemy) traitors, are already filled with "Chinese-thinking" elements. This is an even more serious warning to those who willingly dedicate themselves as running dogs to the × (enemy) clique, harming our people and endangering our nation!</p>
<p>In fact, these people who betray the country and are traitors have already been poisoned by the temporary benefits they seek for themselves. As the saying goes, "Though the body still measures, the heart is already dead." Let us wait and see! ×××××××××××××!</p>
<p>× (enemy) Aircraft Bombing Yu and Rong</p>
<p>The × (enemy) are already in an inextricable quagmire in their military aggression against China. They are now stepping up their political offensive, and the renewed crazy bombing of Chongqing and Chengdu is another manifestation of this political offensive.</p>
<p>However, the × (enemy)'s atrocities have clearly failed completely! Not only has it strengthened the determination of China from top to bottom to unite and resist the war, but it also no longer poses any military threat to us and can no longer cause any damage to our rear construction efforts. For example, the bombing of Chongqing on the 9th only resulted in the tragic death of nine civilians. Most of the × (enemy) bombs landed in destroyed areas, causing no loss to our side. The attack on Yu on the 11th was immediately met by our air force, which shot down two aircraft, causing them to flee in panic. On the same day, an attack on Chengdu resulted in three more aircraft being shot down by us. Here we can see even more that the power of the Japanese × (enemy) has reached the "end of its rope"!</p>
<h3 id="e15">Central Government Plans to Solve the Refugee Problem – Launches Large-Scale Work Relief – Establishes 30,000 Industrial Centers – Mass Reclamation in Twelve Provinces <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai Correspondence] The National Government Relief Committee has launched a large-scale work relief plan in order to completely solve the wartime refugee problem. There are currently 15 million refugees in the country. After the implementation of the above work relief plan, every refugee will have work to do, such as road construction, mining, soap making, agricultural tool manufacturing, and textile production. The Relief Committee has already used 5 million yuan to establish 30,000 industrial centers at the start of the plan, so that millions of refugees will not lose their livelihoods. At the same time, the committee is also preparing to massively reclaim land in twelve provinces, which can reclaim approximately 2 million acres of wasteland, accommodating 15 million refugees so that they can live and work in peace. To date, a total of 50,000 refugees have moved into the reclamation areas in the provinces of Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. If the current colonization plan proceeds smoothly, an even larger group of refugees will be transported to undeveloped areas. In addition, the Relief Committee is considering transferring millions of refugees to remote provinces such as Gansu (Kang) and Xinjiang.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Fires of War Under Mount Luofu <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Fan</p>
<p>(Special Correspondence for This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Our army is closing in on Zengcheng day by day, only two miles away. The Shitan area is also posing a threat to the × people. If Zengcheng and Shitan are both conquered by our army, the × people in Guangzhou will be under great military threat, and the × people in the northwest of the river will also be greatly affected. Therefore, the × people are panicking and quickly transferring more than a thousand soldiers from Guangzhou to Zengcheng, and also transferring more than eight thousand soldiers from Conghua in the north of the river to encircle and attack Mount Luofu, and to sweep through Zengbo (a part of it). As a result, the tragic scene of the barbaric acts of the × people has unfolded again in Zengbo. However, this has once again added a glorious page to the history of the people's liberation here, who have been tempered in struggle.</p>
<p>1.  Turned into Scorched Earth Under the Frenzied Bombing of × Planes</p>
<p>Wherever the × people attack, they first carry out large-scale bombing by the air force. Of course, this time in attacking Mount Luofu and sweeping through Zengbo, they also dispatched a considerable number of air force planes, which were active in the skies here every day. They dropped many bombs and strafed with machine guns in Lianhe, Futian, Lanshi, Sulou, Mazha, Zhengguo, Paitan... In many places, many buildings had already been burned and destroyed when they fell under enemy control before. This time, however, they thoroughly bombed the buildings that had remained, especially turning Futian and Paitan into scorched earth. More than forty people were sacrificed in Futian, and more than a hundred people were killed or injured in Boluo City at one time.</p>
<p>2.  The Burning, Plundering, and × Killing by × Troops Occupying Villages</p>
<p>The burning, plundering, and × killing by the × troops in the occupied areas is a concrete manifestation of the barbarity of its regressive war. I have heard many times in the past, no, I have seen many times with my own eyes. This time, the × people also carried out such brutal sweeps, setting fire to houses wherever they saw them. Paitan, Zhengguo, Lanxi, Sulou, Lianhe, and Futian, especially Paitan, suffered the most severe burning and killing, because the heroic resistance of the people of Paitan was beyond the expectation of the × people. An ambush annihilated four or five hundred "Imperial Army" soldiers, and we also gloriously sacrificed more than eighty soldiers. Therefore, in Paitan, they burned and killed wherever they went. In other places, they burned hundreds of houses. ×××××, because of the rapid action of the × army, those who could not escape in time were all made comfort women by the imperial army. Food and livestock were, of course, what the × people liked the most as supplies that were not easily accessible to the rear. However, in addition to large-scale burning and massacres, the × people also used a policy of appeasement to deal with the peasants. The people captured in Futian were carefully examined, and if they were considered to be genuine peasants, they would be made to pretend to transplant rice seedlings and eat, and patted on the shoulder to tell them to settle down. Of course, if they had any doubts, the frosty white bayonet would be inserted into the flesh of their chest.</p>
<p>The people on the front line here have been taught by the × people. From the experience and lessons they have received from the × people, they have learned how to deal with the × people. This time, the people swept by the × people in Zengbo (a part of it) generally did the work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, but it was not thorough. This is because experience tells them that the × people do not occupy them for a long time, and the × people will retreat after a while. Therefore, their work is limited to the scope of this "experience." Next time, it is hoped that they can understand the overall situation and do effective work, and if necessary, poison the wells and fill the wells. In terms of mass mobilization, some villages can do this: 1. The × people come and sound the gongs to warn; 2. Young people gather and armed forces gather to go up the mountain; 3. The old and young go to a safe place to hide. Of course, they take their belongings with them. They have attacked ×× people many times, but because their organization is not sound, the previous few times have only played a small role.</p>
<p>3.  The Heroic Victory of the People of Paitan</p>
<p>In particular, the heroic and victorious struggle of the people of Paitan this time will make the × people realize the great strength of our people, and can serve as a model for the people to resist Japan. In the past, when the × people first arrived in Paitan, the people of Paitan did not realize what it meant to resist Japan. Many people presented gifts to welcome the imperial army, but the imperial army's response was a round of machine gun fire. As a result, the people of Paitan received a good lesson. This time, the people of Paitan recognized the × people themselves and held a general meeting of the whole village in advance, resolving that all young people with weapons, regardless of the quality of the weapons, should concentrate on attacking the × people, and those who did not go would be executed internally first. Therefore, they concentrated hundreds of guns and, relying on the favorable terrain, ambushed more than 8,000 × people. The × army suffered four or five hundred casualties, and the people of Paitan also gloriously sacrificed more than eighty (killed or wounded). The blood of these more than eighty national heroes will, of course, irrigate the flowers of the people's liberation even more vigorously!</p>
<p>4.  Taoist Zhao of Mount Luofu Still Wants to Take Up a Gun and Fight</p>
<p>When the ×× army broke through the Sulou Cave on Mount Luofu, the Taoists of the Sulou Temple could not avoid the imperial army giving them a good visit. Taoist Zhao also wanted to take up a gun and fight. Taoist Zhao is very fat, with a large belly and a ruddy face, and is in his forties or fifties. His left leg is lame. The reporter talked with him when he went to the Sulou Temple last time. He knew the ways of the world very well. At that time, he knew that he was a passive person who had experienced the vicissitudes of life. This time, the reporter met him at the Sulou Temple, but he did not have the same passive attitude as the Taoist he had previously had. As soon as he started talking, he said indignantly: "I, Zhao Shulin, have been in the Sulou Temple for more than ten years, quietly recuperating in my old age, because I have seen through the 'world'. In the past, I was a secretary in the army, and later I became a battalion commander. As a battalion commander, I was even more dissatisfied with doing many things, so I brought a little money I had earned and came to Mount Luofu to cultivate Taoism. A thousand silver dollars were invested by my family in a business in Mazha Market, but now the store has been burned down, the money is gone, and the forty dollars in my pocket have also been snatched away by the Japanese devils." At this time, he spoke very brightly and urgently, slamming his crutch hard on the floor, causing echoes all around. "You think that if the country is in danger, Taoists can't do it either. I still want to take up a gun and fight." His face became even redder, and the blue veins on both sides of his forehead were throbbing. He was holding his crutch tightly, and the crutch was trembling there.</p>
<p>"If the country is in danger, no one can live. Everyone must take up a gun and fight," the reporter added to his sentence.</p>
<p>5.  The Lives of the People After the Robbery</p>
<p>The lives of the people after the robbery are the most serious problem. Their houses and property are burned and looted every time. After the robbery, they have nothing left and have to endure hunger and cold. Now most of their houses are covered with thatched grass or one or two pieces of bamboo on top of the burned houses, which become their residences. If it rains heavily, the two cracked walls will be moistened by the rain, and everyone will be worried that they will become ghosts crushed to death under these two walls at any time. Eating is also so difficult. As long as they don't starve, it's considered good to have sweet potatoes to eat. A little richer, they only have sweet potato porridge. The reporter saw with his own eyes a family eating. The child picked up a sweet potato and said, "Mom, I don't want sweet potatoes." "If you don't eat sweet potatoes, what will you eat?" The father's stern instruction made the child's hand loosen, and the sweet potato fell to the ground. His eyes stared at his father, and he cried with his mouth wide open. In short, their lives are so hungry and cold, and they can't even get through the minimum.</p>
<p>Now the × people have retreated, leaving behind "hatred" and the still majestic and great natural scenery of Mount Luofu. "Hatred" will turn into a great fire that burns through the wilderness, burning to death that fierce beast. I also wish Mount Luofu to be transformed into a great tomb to bury the × people in the future.</p>

<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>Special Correspondence for This Newspaper (Part 1)</p>
<p>×× Road</p>
<p>Mount Heng (Nanyue) has always been one of the five famous mountains in China, and it used to be very popular for pilgrimage. On the mountain, there is a magnificent Great Hero Hall that occupies hundreds of acres, and its splendor is no less than that of the imperial palace. The beams and pillars are carved with dragons, phoenixes, and patterns. According to the locals, the men and women who came to worship Buddha often followed one after another for dozens of miles without end. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, everything has completely changed. Following the mountains, Mount Heng will also become a scenic spot in modern history. Chairman Chiang's entire analysis of the war situation in the ×× Conference is even more epoch-making in the history of national revolution. On April 26, the reporter left Changsha and took a provincial government car to ××. The purpose of this trip was of course to meet the new fighters of the national liberation war who are being tempered, and the guerrilla cadre training class that is shining the highest degree of glory in the history of military education. As Mr. Bai Chongxi said, guerrilla warfare is the best way to concretely realize total warfare. His intention to establish a cadre training class is naturally to strengthen the guerrilla forces in terms of quality, and to maximize the function of guerrilla tactics to achieve the transformation of the × people's rear into the front line, accumulating small victories into big victories, and carrying out the so-called military, political, economic, and cultural all-round counter-offensive.</p>
<p>From Changsha to Hengshan via Xiangtan, the road is flat and the highway is very good. Because our car broke down in the middle of the road, we arrived at ×× very late. Although this place is only a small town with four or five hundred families, there are not a few people coming and going. We accidentally met Mr. Chen Lie somewhere. He is the director of the political department of the cadre training class. He is not tall, but his strong and solid appearance shows the prestige of annihilating the enemy in front of Jigong Mountain. Meeting him eliminated all the trouble of roundabout communication, so I entrusted him to deliver a letter of introduction to Tang Enbo, the director of education.</p>
<p>At more than five o'clock in the morning, a general who was once called the Iron Man jumped out of a command car in front of the guest house. This was Tang Enbo, with a very cheerful expression and earnest and heroic speech. In terms of appearance, he has the flavor of a modern Zhang Fei. Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng said: "Judging from the attitude and movements alone, we would suspect that General Tang is the younger brother of Mr. Li Zongren, because you have many things in common." This sentence caused us to laugh for a while. In fact, since the Battle of Taierzhuang, Li Tang has always been an old partner who has cooperated consistently and rarely separated. This is just like the opera of Mei Lanfang, if it is not matched with the erhu of Wang Shaoqing, it will inevitably reduce the taste. If there is Li Zongren without Tang Enbo, it seems that it is still not lively enough on the battlefield. We cannot fail to acknowledge that this unprecedented victory in northern Hubei was exchanged for national glory by the flesh and blood of thousands of brothers and the wise and courageous command of Li Tang. Time passed quickly with the trembling of every mouth. Thirty minutes later, we sent Mr. Tang out of the gate of the guest house. At this time, the setting sun was shining on the tips of the weeping willows, and the road on Mount Heng presented a golden color, and the scenery was infinitely lovely.</p>
<p>The Flying Army on ×× Ridge</p>
<p>Because of the hard journey yesterday, I woke up this morning to see the red sun filling the window, it was about eight o'clock. Just after washing up, the waiter came in and said, "A Mr. Deng is visiting." Then I stepped out of the room. Mr. Deng handed me a card from Mr. Tang Enbo, saying that he was inviting us to go up the mountain. While collecting my luggage, I began to chat with this young brother. First of all, I thought to myself that this Mr. Deng was at most an adjutant of Tang's headquarters. This impression was woven from the two conditions of age and clothing. However, it is not appropriate to judge people by their appearance. Mr. Deng is the deputy commander of the cadre training class, and he is also a major general. The so-called soldiers' lives can be said to have been concretely manifested here.</p>
<p>I, Mr. Deng, and Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng, a group of four people, squeezed into a small car, shoulder to shoulder, and sped through the curtains woven by the willow branches on the side of the road. At every corner of the road, there is a portrait of Chairman Chiang, painted on a snow-white wooden board, which makes people feel solemn and respectful. On the stone walls on both sides of the mountainside, there are many slogans written, and the central meaning is of course about guerrilla tactics.</p>
<p>Several bursts of singing came from the pine forest, "We are all flying troops, no matter how high the mountains and how deep the water are." Deputy Commander Deng told us that this was the students doing field exercises. Everywhere is a lecture hall, everywhere is a playground, life is tense and happy, hard and exciting, really a group of young and strong flying troops.</p>
<p>Commander Chen ×× is also a very young figure. He is the commander of the ×× Division and has also made many achievements in the War of Resistance Against Japan. He led us to visit all parts of the school. There are several points that are particularly noteworthy: (1) There is a lecture platform and a blackboard in the dining room, which means that one thing is used for two purposes. When the dining room can also be used as a meeting place, and if there is something that needs to be discussed between students, it can be raised immediately for democratic discussion. (2) Wall newspapers are very common here, and each team has one. The content and layout are very rich and tidy. There are poems and cartoons. (3) The internal affairs are very tidy. Although the school buildings and all material conditions here are not as good as those of military academies or aviation schools, the attention to internal affairs and the performance of achievements are by no means worse than the former. The sheets are folded into squares like tofu. (4) There is a forum for opinions and discussions on daily life or teachers' teaching methods. Some even draw their own opinions into simple patterns, and the way they are expressed is very vivid and the meaning is very profound. There are many gunshots on the shooting range. It is said that the girls are practicing shooting. Mrs. Li Meng was very excited when she heard it. We went around the classroom, went out of the side door, and went to the shooting range to watch the women's army drill. Sure enough, there were two machine guns lined up on the field, and a dozen girls took turns shooting. These are all modern Hua Mulan, female flying soldiers, and strong machine gunners.

<h3 id="e24">Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Will Likely Continue Soon, It Is Said That the British Representative Left for the Soviet Union Yesterday, French Cabinet Meets to Discuss the International Situation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, December 12) Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, took a plane from London to Warsaw on Sunday afternoon, then took a train to Moscow.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Paris, December 12) According to German diplomatic circles, the United Kingdom will send Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, as a special envoy to Moscow, with special authority, authorized by Foreign Secretary Halifax, to discuss new proposals from the British and French governments with the Soviet Union, and has the right to modify them, but on the premise that they do not violate the policies of the British and French governments.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, London, December 12) According to the "Evening Standard," the British government has notified the French and Soviet sides that Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech on Thursday was aimed at the Germans, and its purpose was to counter propaganda and explain that the United Kingdom did not intend to implement a policy of encirclement. The British government has stated to Paris that it will not adopt new policies or intend to make concessions to authoritarian countries.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, December 12] The French cabinet held a meeting this morning, chaired by President Lebrun. Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a broad discussion of the foreign political situation, with particular emphasis on the dispatch of Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, to the Soviet Union. Paris said that Sterndale Bennett carried the latest British proposals and the same French proposals, which will be submitted to the Soviet government. Therefore, Sterndale Bennett is also a representative of both the United Kingdom and France. Foreign Minister Bonnet's earlier explanation of the need to conclude a Turkish-French agreement will also be explained. According to well-informed sources, Foreign Minister Bonnet may formally announce on Monday morning that the Turkish-French draft treaty has been signed. Other issues for discussion include French-Italian relations, the Pope's promotion of the peace movement, and the problem of Syrian refugees in France.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, December 12] The debate on foreign political affairs in the House of Lords will continue on Monday. Foreign Secretary Halifax will defend his recent "peace" speech, because opposition figures believe that the speech indicated that the United Kingdom was preparing to hold negotiations with the Axis countries and condemned it. On Monday morning, the London newspapers expressed doubt about whether the government would re-implement a "policy of appeasement." The "Daily Telegraph" defended the government's attitude and hoped that the German-language broadcast messages from London could make the Germans deeply aware that although the United Kingdom is prepared to negotiate, it will still firmly fulfill its obligations that it has already promised.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, December 11] There are no new news reports in the weekly newspapers here about the dispatch of Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, to the Soviet Union. However, according to a report published in the "Times" on Sunday, if the results of Sterndale Bennett's trip to the Soviet Union are not as expected, another cabinet member will be sent to Moscow with a mandate. The newspaper did not mention who the candidate was. The newspaper believes that the attitude of the Baltic countries to refuse other countries to provide them with guarantees is currently the most difficult problem to solve. The newspaper also said that Sterndale Bennett will propose to the Soviet government a new plan for automatic cooperation between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in the event of a direct or indirect attack. The new plan stipulates that in the event of an invasion, the three countries will immediately consult in order to take joint action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, December 11] Roman newspapers, in addition to expressing their satisfaction with the speeches made by Chamberlain and Halifax, said that what is now expected is proof of the United Kingdom's good intentions. Dada wrote in "The Italian Voice" that "the speeches of the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary make us feel confused. Although their words are very pleasant to hear, the development of the facts is still very different from the spirit of their words." "Il Messaggero," the mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Ciano, said, "We believe in the sincerity and good intentions of the British Prime Minister and Halifax, but if they really want to achieve the convening of a group meeting, then they must express 'I am prepared to negotiate' without involving anything else."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Turkish Capital, December 11] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, accompanied by his wife, came to make an official visit, arriving here at 9:10 a.m. on the 11th. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu personally welcomed him at the station. Gafencu said in a statement to a newspaper that he firmly believes that Yugoslavia will always abide by the Balkan Entente and will be able to take into account both the interests of the Balkan Peninsula and European peace.

<p>[Reuters, Hyde Park, New York, December 12] The British King and Queen left here for Canada at 2 a.m. this morning (standard time). President and Mrs. Roosevelt personally saw them off at the station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hyde Park, New York, December 12] The British King and Queen went to the English church in Hyde Park yesterday morning to pray on Sunday. There were many spectators standing outside the church. The normally very quiet Hyde Park suddenly became bustling. After the service, the British King and Queen had a picnic nearby and rested in the field in the afternoon without any social events.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hyde Park, America, December 11] Hyde Park Village, originally a quiet village, has become a center of crowds today due to the arrival of the British King and Queen. The welcoming crowds began to gather outside the village church from midnight. By 3 a.m. (local time), the number of people gathered was already very large. President and Mrs. Roosevelt accompanied the two Majesties to attend Holy Communion at the church this morning, presided over by Bishop Strider, the head of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Bishop Strider's position in the United States is equivalent to that of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the United Kingdom. Bishop Strider said, "The countries that are holding Holy Communion here today have an impact on the world situation that is far beyond ordinary. Perhaps for this reason, they must bear the greatest responsibility to save the world from the depths of fire and water." President Roosevelt knew that the two Majesties had been through a heavy round of social events in the past three days and needed to rest, so after holding a picnic together, he allowed the two Majesties to spend the afternoon at will.</p>

<p>Nazi dignitaries fly to Hungary to win support; Military preparations reveal unabated desire for war</p>
<p>Rumors of a formal announcement to annex Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Budapest, Hungary, 10th] German Interior Minister Frick visited Hungary, staying for five days. He returned to Germany this afternoon with his wife. During his stay, he reportedly discussed with Hungarian government officials the issue of the German minority in Hungary and ways to enhance cooperation between Germany and Hungary. Of particular importance was the cooperation between the two countries' police authorities to suppress Communist activities. Other issues discussed included the transfer of Jews out of the country, the reception of political exiles, and the signing of a press agreement. It is also reported that Dietrich, the head of the information department of the German Foreign Ministry, will arrive here next week, and Schirach, the leader of the Nazi Youth League, arrived here from Romania at 9:00 PM today and will return to Berlin tomorrow. When speaking to reporters, he claimed that this visit was a private trip.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th] Local newspapers recently reported that Germany is about to end its protection policy over Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia and annex these provinces directly into German territory. The newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party stated that the annexation date will be before the 15th of this month, at which time these provinces will become German provinces and be directly administered by the German central government. Czech cultural autonomy will cease from then on. The current Czech courts will no longer exist, and all officials will be replaced by Germans. Secondly, the independent state of Slovakia will also suffer the same fate. Foreign observers in Berlin have already submitted reports to their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] According to Todt, a German engineer and consultant for the Siegfried Line, Hitler ordered the strengthening of the "Third Line of Defense" between Aix-la-Chapelle and Saarbrücken last October. This project has now been completed. Todt also said that this new defensive工事 extends west of the Siegfried Line, connecting Aix-la-Chapelle and Saarbrücken, while the previous two defensive lines were built on the east side. Todt further said, "The new defensive line is specially equipped with heavy military equipment, and strong fortifications have been added, especially between Saarbrücken and Basel."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The German military authorities built a new line of defense west of the Aachen-Saarbrücken highway (in the southern Saar region) last October to strengthen the defense of western Germany between Aachen and Saarbrücken. The old two lines of defense are east of the highway. According to German newspapers, the defensive strength of the new line of defense is extremely strong. The fortifications have also been increased from Saarbrücken to Basel. The most solid defensive line in Germany at present is the Siegfried Line, which faces France's most solid Maginot Line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th] Germany is actively expanding its military preparations and building defensive fortifications on both its eastern and western borders, employing a large number of workers. As a result, there is a severe shortage of labor in various industries. The government authorities have rehired Jewish people who were forced to give up their jobs to supplement the workforce. Many of these Jews are lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and cultural figures. They are now demolishing old buildings in certain areas according to a plan set by Berlin. One worker, formerly a lawyer, reportedly said that this work is not compulsory, but Jews who are willing to be employed are easily accepted. Some intellectuals felt tired in the early stages of work, but after a while, they became accustomed to it. Supervisors in various factories all agree that Jews are good workers. Our wages average one mark and ten pfennigs per hour, and we work an average of eight hours per day. There is occasional overtime work, which is also paid by the hour. Workers with wives and children receive additional subsidies. In short, although our situation is not ideal, it is better to work hard than to be idle all day or suffer other fates. Whether this is commensurate with our former status is not considered.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 11th] Italian political circles have rumored that Foreign Minister Ciano will visit Spain during the day.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 12th] The 'Daily Telegraph' announced today that Britain can now produce 750 aircraft per month and hopes to increase this to 1,000 aircraft per month after March. Compared with the air force strength of authoritarian countries (especially the German Air Force), the British and French air forces cannot achieve a balance of air power in the West. The heads of the German and Italian air forces are cooperating to discuss detailed plans. The good organization of the air forces of the two countries and the development of the aircraft industry enable the Axis powers to gain air superiority. Since Britain and France cannot compare with Germany and Italy, they should cooperate closely with the air forces of the Soviet Union and Poland.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The first anti-aircraft artillery regiment of the local army was called up for active duty today in accordance with the Reserve Forces Assistance Act, for a period of one month. Other anti-aircraft artillery regiments will also be called up in rotation, with a term of one month.</p>

<p>— Uncle Kang</p>
<p>—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in London—(Middle)</p>
<p>——Negotiations in the Soviet Union——British-German Relations——Britain and France vs. Germany and Italy——Struggle for Spain——Hesitation of the Balkans——British-Turkish Treaty——Greece——Romania——Yugoslavia——</p>
<p>Now, please everyone open a map of Europe. At the westernmost end of the Mediterranean Sea, the only hole leading into the sea is the world-famous Strait of Gibraltar, and at the easternmost end is the Suez Canal, which connects to the Red Sea. Everyone knows that this is the greatest lifeline of maritime transport for Britain and France, but at the same time, everyone also knows that this is the only most basic base for Germany and Italy to develop their dream empire.</p>
<p>In the reporter's previous dispatch, I pointed out some recent military preparations and political conspiracies of Germany and Italy in Africa. The African part referred to there is located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Naturally, those preparations and conspiracies have not stopped recently, but are intensifying. However, there have been no noteworthy new developments. What is now attracting our attention is at both ends of the Mediterranean Sea: the shift in the situation in Spain at the western end, and the hesitant crossroads of the Balkan countries at the eastern end. To put it simply, it is the increasing pressure from Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The Situation in Spain</p>
<p>Recently, there have been two noteworthy events: First, the sudden departure of the German fleet; and second, Goring's planned trip to Spain, which was suddenly canceled. These indicate that there is a problem with the process of Germany and Italy exerting pressure on Franco to make him a completely obedient slave.</p>
<p>Of course, Franco is still a slave in the end, but the problem, although not big, still exists.</p>
<p>What is the problem? Everyone knows that Franco has already accepted the pressure from Germany and Italy and joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact"; and he has dedicated almost all of his land to the strategists of Germany and Italy as a base for their future war against Britain and France, making advance arrangements. However, there is one thing that he has not accepted until now: On the day of the official celebration of the victory of the civil war, he should explicitly propose to Britain the recovery of lost territory—the British-owned Gibraltar military port in the Strait of Gibraltar. Franco has always refused this because he has never given up the idea of ​​borrowing money from Britain and France. As a result, the date of celebrating the victory has been postponed again and again; and correspondingly, the issue of Germany and Italy withdrawing volunteer soldiers, which Britain and France are most concerned about, has also been unyielding.</p>
<p>This stalemate suddenly brewed two very serious crises involving internal and foreign affairs. Based on Germany's background, the leader of the most reactionary fascist faction in Spain, the current Interior Minister Suner, recently exposed a political conspiracy to replace Franco. This made Franco very unhappy with Germany. So, as a kind of demonstration, on the one hand, he asked Germany and Italy in writing to first show him where they are superior to the British and French armies; otherwise, he is unwilling to publicly oppose Britain. On the other hand, he said to the British ambassador that, in fact, he would eventually break up with Germany and Italy, but "the time has not yet matured." If this situation continues to develop, it is possible that the forces of international struggle will use the stage of Spain to have another civil war, unless Franco completely succumbs or is completely overthrown. At the same time, in Spain under Franco's rule, the old forces of the former government army are lurking here and there, waiting for the opportunity to reappear. This is the first crisis at present. On one occasion, in order to thoroughly eliminate the possibility of British financial forces entering Spain, the German ambassador to Spain suddenly received an order. Based on this, he warned Franco that March, Franco's largest financial supporter, who is generally considered to have too much pro-British sentiment, must be removed immediately. However, Franco refused. So, this has now created another tension between Germany and Italy and Franco, becoming the second crisis.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Seriousness of the Tianjin Situation and Britain <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Recent news from various sources reports the serious situation of Japanese harassment of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. The threat from Japan to the British concession is particularly severe. Economic blockade has already been implemented several days ago. The French concession has also been affected. It is said that all kinds of goods except daily necessities are not allowed to be imported or exported to the two concessions, and merchant ships cannot dock at the wharves of the two concessions. Last night, foreign news even reported that Japanese nationals in the British and French concessions had been successively moved back to the Japanese concession, and the Japanese staff of the Tianjin branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank and the foreign exchange bureau of the puppet United Bank also moved out of the British and French concessions on the 11th. External rumors say that the Japanese side will blockade the British and French concessions within days, which is a serious situation unprecedented before. However, the Japanese side's intentions should be deeply understood.</p>
<p>Whether in South China or North China, the Japanese side's offensive against Britain has not gone beyond the style of threats and inducements. However, recently, seeing the hesitation and weakness of the British attitude in Europe or the Far East, the methods have become more vicious. The waves of the Tianjin concessions are one example. What the Japanese side requires from Britain is still: to abandon active assistance to China, to comply with Japan's harsh demands, and even to help it suppress our country's anti-Japanese actions. The Japanese side also often hypocritically proclaims: If Britain can adapt to the Japanese side's demands, then Japan can respect British rights and interests in China. But this is very obviously a deception. It must be known that the ultimate goal of Japan is to "build the so-called New Order in East Asia," in other words, to exclusively occupy the entire East Asia to fulfill the ambition of the "theory of dividing the world into three parts" advocated by people in its government. Its desire to exclusively occupy the entire territory of China goes without saying. ×××××××××××××××××××.</p>
<p>Today, when Japan's strength is still insufficient to resist Britain, or to cover the entire territory of China, it may still play tricks, using part of its rights and interests to induce Britain to make concessions, that is, to release part of its rights and interests to exchange for another part, or to tempt Britain to suppress our country's anti-Japanese actions with certain conditions. But it must be known: Japan's method is indeed a means of defeating each one separately. Weakening the anti-Japanese forces in China by one point also reduces the protection of British rights and interests in China by one layer. Some British people may inevitably harbor some illusions, but its ultimate interests must be closely considered.</p>
<p>The Japanese side's offensive against Britain is on the one hand responding to Germany and Italy, and on the other hand alienating Britain and the Soviet Union. The former serves as a gift for not joining the German-Italian military alliance, and the latter is used to deceive Britain. In this wave in Tianjin, it was no coincidence that the Japanese side used the 'White Russian Anti-Communist Committee' to occupy the Soviet consulate in the Russian concession in Tianjin. Chamberlain's and Halifax's speeches yesterday, softening their attitude toward aggressors, are enough to fuel this trend. Japanese news agencies are expanding their publicity, claiming that they will take "practical actions" against foreign concessions in Tianjin within one or two days. This is just as the Manchester Guardian commented: "Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement has made Japanese leaders believe that they can drive British forces out of China by threats."</p>
<p>For the current plan, Britain should adopt a tough attitude, effectively resist the invaders, and jointly act with the United States and the Soviet Union. The rights and interests of France and the United States in China are also threatened and harmed in the same way as Britain. Although Japan is slightly polite to the United States, its actual harm is no different. The Soviet Union is even more willing to cooperate with Britain. If Chamberlain believes that delaying the conclusion of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, then it is just as the Manchester Guardian commented above: "It is a big mistake and a terrible mistake."</p>
<h3 id="e34">British Newspapers Discuss British Far East Policy <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The level of assistance to China is far less than that of Germany and the United States; allowing Japan to invade is a big mistake</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The Manchester Guardian commented, "Seeking the reason why Japan must openly provoke a rupture between Britain and Japan, if possible, no one can admit that Japan's determination clearly wants this. The extent of British assistance to China is not only less than that of Germany, but also not seen to be slightly more than that of the United States. However, Japan must be against Britain alone because of old grievances or other reasons, or because it thinks Britain is deceitful and cites Britain as a scapegoat for Japan's failure. Whether Japan wants to slightly comfort Germany's desire by refusing to participate in the Three-Power Military Agreement and using this kind of provocative behavior, or whether Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy has made Japanese leaders believe that they can drive British forces out of China by threats, this should be stopped at this time. The Japanese government should bear its blame and should be warned, stating what will happen if it continues this policy. The interests of the United States and France in China are also trampled by the Japanese in the same way. The British government should immediately consult with the governments of the United States and France on countermeasures. To allow the Far East to be任由侵略 as the price for maintaining neutrality in European disputes is a big mistake. The covenant can be abandoned, but Japan is in the Far East, not in Europe."</p>

<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>Men Under Heaven are Generally Stupid</p>
<p>I divorced John.</p>
<p>It's really strange. Don't look at John with his six-foot figure and full muscles, but he always can't get rid of that sissy. I didn't feel it at first, but after two years of marriage, I saw it.</p>
<p>Once, he lost his job, but I happened to find a job that could bring in some income to support the family. Guess what? John honestly became a housekeeper and did trivial cooking at home. Every day he always said that he would definitely go out to find a job tomorrow; however, tomorrow was甲天, he was still squatting at home.</p>
<p>So, I realized that our marriage was a mistake; I simply couldn't be his virtuous wife; what he needed was an extremely feminine and delicate woman. In this way, he would have to go out and find a way out himself.</p>
<p>Taylor</p>
<p>Not long after my divorce, I met Taylor, a romantic figure. He is the director of a large company. From the beginning, he was very attentive to me, taking me to nightclubs and theaters every day, and constantly sending me flowers and gifts.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was also moved. However, soon after, I realized that Taylor was an extremely self-righteous person, completely different from John.</p>
<p>Taylor was extremely particular about his clothes and gave small accounts in a particularly close manner. In the elevator, if anyone bothered him, he would never give up; in the restaurant, he was even more nitpicking and critical. In his mind, except for him, no one in the world was good. The salesmen under him were idiots, and his superiors were fools.</p>
<p>Taylor is his mother's only son, so naturally he was spoiled. It was very clear that if you want to marry him, you must praise him like a god all day long.</p>
<p>Arthur</p>
<p>Every woman will meet a man like Arthur. He is a senior战员 in a large construction company, and the company relies on him very much. Our friendship progressed slowly, but as I gradually became familiar with him, I admired him more and more.</p>
<p>Arthur is very knowledgeable and speaks eloquently. The only problem is that he lacks a little courage to express his feelings.</p>
<p>He already loved me very much, but he didn't say it, letting time slowly express it. He was a bit indecisive. When we went out to play, this or that, he always asked me.</p>
<p>For other women, such a husband may be very suitable. But I don't want a husband who wholeheartedly serves me.</p>
<p>Robert</p>
<p>I met Robert at a banquet. He is a likable young man, only twenty-one years old, who just came out of college, holding a strong desire to conquer the world. He quickly fell in love with me and asked to marry me. "I am the only woman in the world."</p>
<p>I also liked him very much, but I am six years older than him! In terms of experience, I may be twenty years older than him. I felt that he was looking for a mother, not a wife.</p>
<p>Robert lost his mother early and was raised by two aunts. He had never tasted motherly love, and now he needed a mother.</p>
<p>Harold</p>
<p>Soon after, I met Harold. He is a nervous person who has tried every profession in the thirty-six trades. He often meditates, inventing something to make millions of dollars, but he still lives in a simple house.</p>
<p>Although he doesn't make a fortune, he spends money lavishly, spending as much as he has, without any stinginess.</p>
<p>When his interest in invention diminished, he became very passionate about me. I was again "the first woman in the world." He said that if I refused to marry him, he would commit suicide. I refused, and he drank alcohol for two weeks and then became interested in something else.</p>
<p>I think there is no hope. Men Under Heaven are all like this, who should I marry?</p>

<p>Someone hired a cook who was extremely skilled at skimming oil. No matter what dish he made, he always had to skim some oil to his satisfaction. Although the owner knew, he could not think of any way to solve it. One day, the owner personally bought half a catty of braised pork, and then personally cut it open and carefully counted it, a total of thirty-two pieces, and then sent it to the kitchen to add soy sauce. He thought to himself that in this way, there would probably be no more problems. Later, when it was served on the table, the number was counted, no more and no less, still thirty-two pieces, but the amount was greatly reduced. Each piece had been cut a little by the cook. In addition to 感叹, he wrote a poem to record the matter. The poem says:</p>

<p>— Han Fuqu</p>
<p>Han Qingtian, this figure who yearned for 18th-century political theories and techniques, dreamed of the Bao Longtu quartet: private visits to understand the people's suffering, night trials of bandits, beheadings for public display, and great satisfaction to the people. However, he was also unwilling to lag behind in "new methods." Taking "giving speeches" as an example, he enjoyed it tirelessly. In addition to the weekly Monday memorial service, which was a guaranteed performance, he would seize any opportunity to showcase his talent. Although Qingtian did not recognize many characters, each speech was carefully written by Secretary Bei: the characters had to be upright, large, and easily understood by the masses. If, by chance, one-sixth or one-seventh of the characters were beyond Qingtian's vocabulary, one had to admire Qingtian's effort in learning from his secretary, painstakingly memorizing them.</p>
<p>Once, at a joint school sports meet in Jinan, how could Qingtian not go to give a speech? While he was on stage diligently reciting the speech, the wind sprite played a prank and blew the manuscript away. Qingtian was greatly flustered: "Damn it, the wind... Zhao Desheng, chase the speech!" However, the wind was truly strong that day, and Zhao Desheng chased it for quite a while, at least three minutes. He brought a piece of paper back to the stage, but Qingtian saw that it was not right. It was about the 100-meter preliminary race, group exercises, and other such programs. Qingtian angrily shouted, "Damn it! Damn it! This Chairman... is finished!"</p>

<p>Previous extract: The fast ship "Kairon Zephei," sailing the Germany-America route, was carrying six million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator for the Chux Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, were also on board to travel in Europe. On the ship, they encountered the French aviator Roumong Garo, a man they had saved before...</p>
<p>"It's him. But what is he doing here? I thought he was organizing the air force in France."</p>
<p>Before long, they were warmly shaking hands with the short French man. He gestured a lot, twisting his mustache, expressing how happy he was to meet these two brave children who had saved his life.</p>
<p>"We really didn't expect to meet you," Jack said. "We didn't know you were in America."</p>
<p>The little Frenchman shrugged and secretly glanced around. He said in a very secretive whisper:</p>
<p>"No one knows I'm here except my government."</p>
<p>"Are you on some secret mission?" Jack asked.</p>
<p>"If I told you what I'm doing in America, would you keep it a secret for me?"</p>
<p>"Of course, but if you don't want to—I'm not trying to pry," Jack quickly said.</p>
<p>"That's good, my friends!" Roumong Garo said. "You saved my life, and I would be ungrateful if I kept it from you. I came to America to buy and transport airplanes for France."</p>
<p>"But I thought France already had a very adequate air force," Bill said.</p>
<p>"We have needed more planes for a long time," he said. "I hope we can double it again, but for now, I can't say more. I advise you to listen to the wireless more! Are you here for a vacation?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, I think we should have a happy holiday," Jack said.</p>
<p>The Frenchman answered with a shrug and a smile.</p>
<p>"Your holiday is probably just what you Americans call a 'pipe dream,'" he said, the two young men puzzled by his meaningful words.</p>
<p>2. War Declared</p>
<p>"Well, Jack Red, do you really like watching me work?"</p>
<p>The speaker was Hayes Balfour, a blond, red-cheeked wireless operator on the "Kairon Zephei." On the third afternoon after the ship set sail, Jack discovered that he had met Hayes Balfour before, and they rekindled their friendship. Balfour's greatest pleasure was that on the first day the ship set sail, the German wireless operator's machine had a slight malfunction, which Jack fortunately helped him repair.</p>
<p>Since then, Jack had spent most of his time in the wireless room, ostensibly, as Balfour said, "watching me work." In fact, in addition to his original interest in wireless, there was another thing that made him want to stay in the "Kairon Zephei" wireless room all day long.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Domestic Tea Allowed to Ship to Shanghai - Lan and Wheat Successively Appear - Jiangsu-Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Harvest Blocked from Shipping to Shanghai - First Batch of 100 Bags of Wheat Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Tea, spring cocoons, and wheat from all over the country are successively entering the market. Merchants are raising funds to purchase them separately. Tea, in addition to domestic sales, is being gathered for export. Jiangsu and Zhejiang spring cocoons are being blocked from shipping to Shanghai. The first batch of wheat has arrived in Shanghai. Banks and firms are providing loans for tea, orchids, and wheat, except in the occupied areas, still according to regular loan practices. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tea: After the new tea from Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, and other provinces entered the market this year, foreign firms, tea shops, and raw tea merchants borrowed money from banks and sent agents to purchase from the producing areas. Qimen, Wenzhou, Pingshui, Huizhou, and other places had a bumper tea harvest. However, except for domestic tea shops and raw tea that are allowed to be shipped to Shanghai for sale, foreign tea, including black tea, green tea, and tea bricks, is strictly prohibited from being shipped to Shanghai and must be concentrated for export from Hong Kong. Tea factories in various places have been rushing to produce, and exports of Chinese tea have increased sharply since May, valued at more than 10 million national currency units. As for the tea collected by Fuhua Company, it is limited to foreign tea, because the Trade Commission has signed tea sales contracts with the Soviet Union and other countries, designating Hong Kong as the port of export.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are cocoon-producing areas. After the spring cocoons in various places entered the market, the cities were controlled and purchased by so-called "Central China Companies," while in rural towns, manufacturers were allowed to purchase freely. Cocoon shops in various parts of Zhejiang have successively stopped weighing, while cocoon shops in Wuxi, Jiangsu, have opened. However, manufacturers who purchased cocoons in Zhejiang wanted to transport them to Shanghai and the concession areas, but were blocked by the Japanese. Negotiations are currently underway between manufacturers and the Japanese. Silk mills in the concession originally planned to start operations after the spring cocoons entered the market, but now they have had to postpone them due to the blocking of new cocoons from being shipped to Shanghai. Regarding the Jiangsu-Zhejiang spring cocoon harvest, improved varieties account for about 80-90%, which can be said to be a bumper harvest, while native varieties have a poor harvest. However, the total spring cocoon production has increased compared to last year.</p>
<p>Wheat: China's wheat-producing areas are widespread throughout the country, with Shanghai being the gathering area. Now, wheat from various places has begun to enter the market. Wheat from the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Delta area has arrived in Shanghai. Manufacturers and grain shops have sent personnel to collect the goods. The first batch of new wheat from Pudong and other places arriving in Shanghai is about 100 bags, with a quoted price of about 5.5 yuan. It is reported that the Jiangbei area had a bumper harvest this year, estimated to produce about 4 million bags. Flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, are also preparing to purchase as much as possible, but only those suitable for flour production. The foreign wheat previously ordered has already arrived in Shanghai one after another, totaling about 2 million metric tons. Now, because new wheat has entered the market, the ordering of foreign wheat has been stopped to avoid large amounts of foreign exchange leakage.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Learning to "Rebel" (Fǎn) <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Kai</p>
<p>The "rebel" ("反" - fǎn) in "learning to 'rebel'" does not refer to the "rebel" ("造反" - zàofǎn) in "rebellion," nor does it refer to the "rebel" ("反" - fǎn) in "inferring three corners from one corner." It refers to the "rebel" ("反" - fǎn) in "oppose" ("反對" - fǎnduì") and "opposite" ("相反" - xiāngfǎn"). In this world, there are things that are positive and things that are negative, and sometimes the positive cannot be used, and only the negative can be used, or sometimes the positive will inevitably turn into its opposite. Therefore, if you seize the opportunity and make great use of the negative, you can gain the favor of others, be assured of success, kill without paying with your life, and get rich without lifting a finger. Knowing the essence of this is extremely useful for interacting with people and conducting affairs. The meaning of "rebel" is great!</p>
<p>I once talked about a joke, saying that a brother had a piece of candy in his hand and said to his younger brother, "If you can guess what I have in my hand, I will give you this candy to eat." At that time, I thought this person was too stupid and had to laugh at him, but later I regretted that this laughter was very inappropriate. Originally, whether he had candy in his hand or not was not mentioned in the book, and I had no way of knowing. If, unfortunately, he did not have candy in his hand, he would be the smartest person in the world, and the person who laughed at him would be the stupidest person in the world. Because he said he had candy when he had no candy, it is the negative. Not only will his younger brother not be able to guess, but I think if you took it to all the 1.6 billion people in the world to guess, I'm afraid no one would say that he really has no candy. His great wisdom can be known to the world.</p>
<p>For example, all the stores are having big sales, big bargain sales, crazy bargains, auctions, giveaways, and prize-guessing, making it very lively, and everyone is tired of seeing it. You come up with "Always pragmatic, not appealing to discounts." On the one hand, you can use the "appeal" of "not appealing to discounts" to "appeal," and when people come to buy, and you want to offer a discount, you can point to the advertisement and say, "Not appealing to discounts naturally means no discounts. Our store is pragmatic and far superior to other stores. Moreover, a great man's words are as fast as a team of horses." In this way, you will gain both fame and profit, achieving two things at once. This further shows the great usefulness of "rebel."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that "rebel" can make you achieve great wisdom, gain fame and profit, and is extremely useful. Therefore, since we live in this world as human beings, reading books, doing things, eating, and sleeping, we have to learn "rebel." As mentioned above, "rebel" can gain you favor, make you assured of success, allow you to not pay with your life, and allow you to not lift a finger. Therefore, while Mr. Geng Zhi is advocating "learning to be clever" and "learning to push," I also come up with a set of "doing things in reverse."</p>
<p>For example, if someone is ignorant, you can say he is "learned"; if someone is stingy, you can say he is "generous"; if someone is stupid, you can call him "honest"; if someone is not prominent, you can say "I have long admired your name like thunder, but I have been unable to pay my respects due to geographical barriers." If someone is insane, you can call him "noble and humorous," worthy of comparison to Chun Yu Kun and Ximen Bao, and following in the footsteps of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. You can also say that if the Grand Historian were alive, he would write a biography for you. In short, you can adapt to the circumstances, understand them spiritually, and at any rate, only expend a little effort of your tongue. Others will say you are good, and you can do a decent favor yourself. If you add the sentence "Always pragmatic, not praising others," then the value is even greater.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are farting, you can use a handkerchief to cover your own nose. If you want to kill someone, you can say that you are also among those being killed. If you are engaging in lewd behavior, you can say that you will also suffer the consequences. If you do this in reverse, you will be innocent. Not only can the sin be pushed away, but also, in addition to avoiding it, you can use it to manipulate others. This is not included in "learning to push," so I mention it separately. Similarly, if you want to make money, you can declare yourself incorruptible; if you want to do both things at once, you can say that you are not involved in either; if you want to be a bat, you can say you are a hybrid to save trouble; if you want to be a translator, you can also say you are absorbing foreign culture; even marrying a foreign wife can be said to be reducing the foreign population and causing a labor shortage there; working somewhere can be said to be absorbing foreign capital and bringing it back to the country, causing a financial drain there. Therefore, abandoning the country can be called loving the country, seeking peace can be called saving the people, and so on, which are too numerous to list.</p>
<p>Once you "rebel" like this, if it fits the situation, everyone will believe you. As long as you speak eloquently, resonantly, and logically, everyone will definitely feel that you are the only one to be respected, without any doubt, and they may even treat your words as the truth and include them in the Four Books and Five Classics. Because in the world, only you are the most intelligent, and there is only this one, without any separation. Others are either extremely foolish, moderately foolish, or slightly foolish. Your intelligence is unmatched in the world and has never been seen since the beginning of mankind. Therefore, "rebel" must be known, must be learned, and must be practiced. If you know it and can put it into practice, learn it and can practice it, then isn't it delightful? There is no doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e46">A Monument Without Words <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>This is a deep valley, damp, gloomy, without human voices, without footsteps. Stalactites on the walls drip with trickling springs, mixed with green moss. A night as black as ink. It seems that my vision is particularly sluggish. I cannot use the soft bristle brush of my eyes to wipe away the thick dust that has accumulated.</p>
<p>Vaguely, I ponder, I ponder, through the high crevice, like a white egret flying, flying towards the depths of the blue sky. Soaring in the macrocosm, floating clouds become my footpads, stepping on layers of clouds, I ascend to the high heavens.</p>
<p>It is not lonely. I do not have the usual loneliness of a traveler, the contemplation in a lonely inn under a dim lamp, the sigh beside an old tree and a crow on an ancient road. A long journey does not make me feel bored. Under the layers of the firmament, I read long stories one after another. The story is inscribed on a monument. One story, long, perhaps endless. I can never finish reading it. It proves life. It is life. Striving, rebirth, creation, beauty, glory, all are told to us in the story. Carved on the White Cloud Mountain, on the stars, on the sun and the moon, these are the monuments, monuments without words.</p>
<p>It should be said that this monument is as tall as the heavens. Often, a person with sincerity and courage to look at the monument can often discover the boundless height of the monument. Step on another layer of clouds. Add another layer of soft cushions under your feet. A free traveler can constantly see this monument. When the sun rises from the sea, and the heavenly rooster is heard in the air, even in the dim stars of the Well constellation, you can still get this wordless inscription as your companion when you ascend to the high heavens. It is definitely not at your feet, it is higher than you, higher than the sun and moon, higher than the stars, higher than the white clouds. You continue, you are moved, you shed tears, lonely joy, dispirited pushing, struggling comfort, entranced awakening.</p>
<p>It seems that these many stories are the ones you are most familiar with. It is also a life, explaining life, explaining the success of struggle, the destination of justice. This story touches you, makes you understand life, makes you know that life is only about struggle. You read a magnificent story, touched by the people in the monument, and mourn their magnificence. The story also makes you hesitate, you shed tears, smeared the inscription, buried the thoughts, made them the foundation of your monument, and now you are reading another bigger monument, you will not be able to tell whether this is for your emotion or the lament of the people in the monument. You are very familiar with the stories in the monument, the greatness opens your heart and lungs, the joy makes you slam the table and shout, the wails of the people in the monument are your tears, the anger is your curse. Laughter is your smiling face. You can count the beating of the hearts and the breathing of the mouths and noses of thousands of people in silence. There were no words on the monument originally, but you cannot help but be amazed by the magic of wordlessness. Angry claws tear at your chest, and insults also run through your heart with a heavy hammer. A plain of fragrant grass unfolds before your eyes, many lessons from the race, and memories in the mind. Often, in amazement, unconsciously, while silently reciting the inscription, you cry bitterly, shed tears, encounter danger, struggle, and finally awaken, hesitate, decide, and feel at ease. You push aside your pillow and despise the clown in your dream. At this moment, the first sun shines on the tall forest...</p>
<p>Accompanied by us, break through the sky, walk out of the dream, spread our wings, we have courage, we are not lonely. For example, our journey is to experience a life of struggle, and the monument is a signpost and spur for the pioneers, it is a past, explaining sacrifice and success. It is also life, giving us life to prove.</p>
<p>Without the songs and poems of a clear temple, without the strange words of Zuo Qiusou, without the deep eaves of coverage, you don't have to worry about the wetness of the rain, the wildfires of the burning collection, the horns of mad cows. There is not a single word, yet it has written down the struggle of mankind for thousands of years, darkness and light, round faces and beasts, baseness and sublimity. There is not a single punctuation mark. Yet it moves people, makes people cry, history, only makes people feel tedious and emptiness, dull like a machine, rotten like rotten wood. You will therefore praise the monument more, a living and fresh life, with blood, with struggle, with success, with sacrifice, with magnificence, leading you, and also explaining you. You react because of the emotion, and your life becomes a monument. Give the monument an explanation, give mankind praise, it is like a strict teacher, correcting you, criticizing you, teaching you, and a close friend, relying on you, accompanying you, helping you. When you flap your wings and fight the wind, you need the monument to lead and encourage you, to complete your free flight. Complete your free flight, like the past people in the monument. From struggle to immortality, write down the past and the present on the monument.</p>
<p>You silently recite, encouraging others; you struggle with your eyes, giving others an ode.</p>
<p>Carved on the white clouds, on the stars, on the sun and the moon, these are the monuments, monuments without words.</p>

<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>3. So much importance to people</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, the sky was just showing the color of fish belly, and we crawled out of the darkness and the dirty quilts of the inn, put the towel into a soup bowl-sized basin, soaked it in water, roughly washed our faces, and took our luggage and left the inn, climbing onto the truck. A gray-white frost shrouded the surroundings, and the whistling wind pierced our hearts and lungs. Everyone was shrinking like a snail, squatting on the car. The snot dripping from their noses showed how much they loved the cold air. The driver hadn't come yet—probably hadn't gotten up yet. In fact, there was no need for the passengers to climb onto the car so early to wait and suffer the cold, but the Chinese are too selfish, and they always rush to climb onto the car early to occupy the good seats, leaving no room for those who come later to insert their feet. So everyone had to compete to grab seats.</p>
<p>Everyone抢你夺我,叽哩咕噜吵了好一会儿, the sun had already showed its face stubbornly on the mountain peak in the east. The driver and the assistant who pressed the car, wearing khaki cotton uniforms, walked out of the inn looking a bit sleep-deprived, and the passengers' mood was relieved a little: the car could start.</p>
<p>The driver and the assistant worked together to add gasoline and inspect the machine parts, then they both jumped into the car, put the motor into gear with a *bu bu bu* sound, and were just about to drive away when they asked the passengers:</p>
<p>"Are all the passengers here?"</p>
<p>"All here," the passengers answered in unison.</p>
<p>At this instant, a soldier came imposingly from across the street and waved his hand, calling out:</p>
<p>"I want to ride on your car."</p>
<p>He was wearing a khaki wool uniform, with his leather coat open, about forty-five years old, with dark cheeks, slightly protruding eyes, revealing a fierce look. He was wearing a short sword and carrying a pistol, but he had not fastened his collar badge, so his rank was unknown. A truck, in addition to being fully loaded with luggage, was also carrying twenty-four passengers, so there was originally no room to stand. Therefore, when the passengers heard him say he wanted to ride on this car, everyone instinctively answered in unison:</p>
<p>"There's no room."</p>
<p>He pretended not to hear, and continued to walk towards the car. Approaching the side of the car, he wanted to climb up. The passengers said again:</p>
<p>Seeing that the car really couldn't fit another person, and that the passengers unanimously refused to let him ride, the driver jumped out of the car and said to the soldier:</p>
<p>"There's really no room on the car. Please take the second car."</p>
<p>"I'll give you money."</p>
<p>The soldier had already started to get angry, and took out a ten-yuan bill from his pocket and threw it at the driver, while wanting to climb into the car himself. The driver was a young man of about twenty-five years old. His temper was also very high, and he hurriedly replied:</p>
<p>"Passengers can't buy a ticket even if they give dozens of dollars. If you want to ride, go to the company to buy a ticket. We don't sell tickets here." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Xu Qing</p>
<p>Night descends into my room, the air as heavy as an ancient tomb.</p>
<p>The dim light casts my shadow on the wall, like a gaunt pine, thin and disheveled. I manage a wry smile, knowing I am deeply lonely.</p>
<p>A gentle knock at the door.</p>
<p>A young friend enters, silent, as if an unexpected guest. I struggle to recall his name, his background, his personality – almost impossible. The only certainty is that he is my friend. He scans me with a keen gaze, seemingly aware of my confusion.</p>
<p>"Friend! Have you even forgotten me?"</p>
<p>His tone feels more familiar.</p>
<p>"Truly, please forgive my forgetfulness!" I say apologetically.</p>
<p>"Then surely you remember what happened two years ago! Just two short years! Has city life eroded your memory so thoroughly?"</p>
<p>I remember now. He is indeed a close friend. Two years ago, he was younger, more given to laughter and talk. Now he is haggard, his face darkened, his hair long and wild, like a tangle of weeds.</p>
<p>"Where have you been all this time?"</p>
<p>"I! I've been pulling ropes." A smile illuminates his shadowed face.</p>
<p>"Pulling ropes! Don't you find it bitter?"</p>
<p>"You're too dull. Don't you know the rewards that follow suffering?" He chuckled, removing his shirt to reveal two dark, leathery shoulders crisscrossed with rope burns, the purple bruising peeking through the raw skin.</p>
<p>"Ah! What beautiful marks!" I exclaim. "Many of us pull a massive boat, through rushing rapids and treacherous mountain gorges. No day, no night, enduring wind, snow, and the scorching sun. You must understand, accomplishing a difficult and noble task, that is a sacred thing!"</p>
<p>As he speaks, gesturing as if pulling a rope, I feel my desk shifting, my room moving, the world in motion.</p>
<p>"Sacred deed—sacred deed—a great sacred deed—"</p>
<p>"Friend, don't get too excited. The work isn't finished yet! It's just that our boat is a little old, needs some urgent repairs. Well, I must be going!"</p>
<p>Swiftly, too fast to grasp, he is gone.</p>
<p>He is gone.</p>
<p>A tide of emotion surges through me. This small room can no longer contain me. I leap up and hurl a pen with force:</p>
<p>"Get to it, pull up the ancestral tow rope!"</p>

<h3 id="e49">English South China Morning Post Editorial: Expressing Firm Belief in Our Legal Tender <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Allowing Legal Tender to Seek a New Level is the Most Effective Method</p>
<p>The price of the national currency has recently undergone slight changes. Authoritative opinions suggest that this does not harm our country. The Hong Kong English South China Morning Post published an editorial yesterday titled "Chinese Currency," expressing optimism about the authoritative views and believing that our country's credit has not disappeared and our country's monetary policy has achieved good results. The translation of the article is as follows:</p>
<p>The authoritative opinions recently expressed regarding Chinese legal tender provide a good assurance. The sudden cessation of support for Chinese legal tender appears obvious, but the reasons are not as commonly suspected. It is not primarily political but, to a large extent, a strategic response to the war with Japan. However, this can only be speculated. Reports targeting speculators provide significant reference material. According to authoritative opinions, this is a result of natural conditions, most notably China's imbalanced foreign trade and "capital outflow." Due to these factors, maintaining exchange rates is difficult and risks depleting the stabilization fund. Therefore, the authorities have decided to allow the legal tender to seek its own price level and then maintain that new level. It has been confidently stated that this measure can be implemented firmly. It is recalled that a similar step was taken in June 1938, when the exchange rate fell from one shilling and two pence to eight pence, and the eight-pence exchange rate was maintained for a year. China's wartime economic policy, according to the authority, has been effective. Many items previously imported are now manufactured domestically, and reports of an expected bumper harvest this year should help reduce imports. Meanwhile, arrangements have been made for the foreign exchange needed by the government to purchase military supplies and other goods, so as not to affect the foreign exchange market. Finally, the stabilization fund has been replenished, and efforts to expand the fund's base have been successful. Careful consideration will surely lead one to accept the assurances of the authorities. The fact that the Chinese currency was prevented from falling further when it reached six and a half pence is credible. The state of panic-stricken capital flight often seen during foreign exchange collapses does not exist. According to Reuters, a rate of thirty-five yuan to one pound is not the best or cheapest way to protect capital. Conservatives prefer to buy stocks or sense the danger of European war affecting national currencies. Under today's management system, holding currencies of various countries cannot guarantee stability. We must remember that China is not a country in a normal state today, and ups and downs are inevitable. The possibility of the Chinese legal tender rebounding cannot be dismissed. Regardless of the Ministry of Finance's situation, China cannot be called bankrupt. The biggest difficulty is foreign exchange, not resources. Factory openings for purchasing military supplies should have a positive effect, and the industrial cooperative movement can help increase remittances from overseas Chinese and reduce the country's foreign payments. China's credit remains good. The most noteworthy aspect of the authority's comments is the replenishment of the fund. Whether the fund has covered its losses or increased its resources is not clearly explained. However, based on various phenomena, the situation is still satisfactory. The fund will inevitably suffer losses, but it has not reached the point of depletion. Even according to Japanese rumors, no one dares say that ten million pounds has become forty million pounds. Considering the fund's large deposits in Hong Kong, the claim that the fund currently only holds a portion in the UK (i.e., five million pounds) is inaccurate. Under the same interpretation, the Hong Kong dollar will not fall. The Financial Secretary's remarks were expected. Although there has been much commentary in Shanghai on the sudden changes in the price of Chinese legal tender, there is no need to worry. If the authorities cannot handle the situation properly, shortsighted individuals will ask why make efforts to support it. The answer is that free trade in legal tender is important. In addition to military supplies, China must purchase food. Furthermore, if China allows the legal tender to decline, Japan will manipulate the financial market to eliminate the interests of foreigners and enslave the Chinese people.</p>

<p>The Philippine Chinese Youth Association recently sent representatives, including Liu Ziwang and two others, to Hong Kong to discuss the convening of the Far East Youth Conference with Hong Kong's youth student circles. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association, in order to understand the overall situation of the Philippine overseas Chinese's efforts to save the nation, specially held a tea party at the Association last night at eight o'clock to welcome the representatives and exchange opinions. Thirty members of the Association attended, and the atmosphere was exceptionally enthusiastic. They gathered at eight o'clock for the meeting. After saluting,</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The meeting was opened by Chairman Li Zhengyao, who briefly stated, "Three representatives of the Philippine Youth Association have come to our Association today. On behalf of the students, I extend a warm welcome. We know that the overseas Chinese students in the Philippines have supported the war of resistance against Japan and aided the war of resistance for the past two years, and they have achieved excellent results. Last year, they launched the organization of the All-Philippine Student Youth Conference, forming a solid wall of Philippine youth and exerting its great power to aid our country's war of resistance. This spirit is enough to inspire all overseas Chinese in the Philippines to be even more enthusiastic about national salvation work. Such amazing achievements are truly admirable. For two years, in addition to military force, the [Japanese] have used various other methods to [invade] our country, exhaustively [flattering] and [enticing] youth in various places to cover up their acts of aggression. For example, they recently organized a tour group to Japan in the Philippines, actively enticing Philippine youth to visit Japan, and giving them extremely good treatment after they arrived in Japan, using the ignorant to spread propaganda and cover up the truth. In order to expose this conspiracy of the Japanese, young people with aspirations are convening the Far East Youth Conference, so that the youth of the Far East can unite together, [ ]. This time, the three representatives have come to Hong Kong from the Philippines, braving a long journey. On behalf of the students, I sincerely offer our mutual assistance in this matter, so that it can be realized as soon as possible, and I wish the representatives success when they go to Chongqing."</p>
<p>Representative's Speech</p>
<p>After the chairman's speech, Liu Ziwang, the representative of the Philippine Youth Association, gave a speech on the overall situation of the Philippine overseas Chinese youth's efforts to save the nation. Mr. Liu stood up and spoke in Mandarin, saying that the Philippine overseas Chinese youth's efforts to save the nation have very little experience, so the results are not as good as those in Hong Kong. This time, I hope to get more instructions from you on the direction of national salvation work, so as to be a model for us. In the past, Philippine overseas Chinese students studied in foreign schools and some studied in overseas Chinese schools. The environments were different and the concepts were different, so there was very little unity. "Since the August 13th Incident," all the students in the Philippines deeply knew that everyone needed to unite to serve the motherland, so at this time the Philippine Overseas Chinese Youth Association was established, concentrating the power of all the young students in the Philippines to expand the national salvation propaganda work. Mobile propaganda teams were organized to disperse to the villages all over the Philippine Islands, publicizing in all places where Chinese [lived]. They went through once, twice, three times. This kind of activity propaganda was able to achieve considerable results. All overseas Chinese in the Philippines had a deeper understanding of the motherland's war of resistance. In December of last year, the Youth Association once convened the International Student Conference. Representatives from all countries in the Far East participated. At the conference, the actual facts of our country's war of resistance and the [Japanese's] various acts of aggression were publicized as much as possible. The representatives expressed their deep sympathy for our country. Since then, there has been further expression of aid to China. The understanding and actions of people in the Philippines regarding our country's war of resistance can be roughly divided into three periods. The first period was at the beginning of the "July 7th" incident. A small number of people had already expressed sympathy for our country's war of resistance, and they immediately organized the "China Friendship Society," but the majority of people did not yet understand the truth of our country's war of resistance. In the second period, the majority of intellectuals had already understood that our country was fighting to maintain world justice and peace, and they actively promoted the aid to China movement. The third period was the beginning of practical action, such as donating money to relieve our country's wounded soldiers and refugees, boycotting Japanese goods, etc., which were very strenuous. Recently, the "Philippine Peace Conference" was established, and the "Guarantee Democratic Alliance" organization was formed to help China resist aggression and sanction aggression, and further devote itself to maintaining the peace and security of the Pacific. The purpose of launching the Far East Youth Conference this time is to unite the youth of the Far East, concentrate their strength, and achieve the purpose of maintaining justice and peace. The delegation was specially sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with the comrades of the Hong Kong Youth Student Circle on how to proceed, hoping to get your advice, etc. After the representatives finished their speeches, representatives of the Student Relief Association reported on the association's affairs. The Philippine representative Yu Binghong gave a speech. Finally, there was a tea party, and the meeting was dismissed after a free talk.</p>

<p>Woman Yao Xiuying, twenty-two years old, from Shanghai, was accused of entering the Murray Barracks privately on the 10th of this month. When the case was brought before the Central Magistracy on the morning of the 10th, the defendant claimed that her sister was working at a Westerner's residence on the Peak. That night, she wanted to visit her sister. She was from Shanghai and had only been in Hong Kong for a short time, so she didn't know the way and mistakenly entered the restricted area. Two Westerners in uniform escorted her to a place and then took off her upper and lower garments, etc. The magistrate believed that the defendant's statement should be investigated to determine its truth. Therefore, the case was postponed until the morning of the 12th for further review. When the case was reviewed again yesterday morning, the prosecutor, Mr. Baker, told the magistrate that the defendant appeared to be suffering from mental illness. The magistrate asked the defendant why she went to find her sister at night rather than during the day. The defendant said that if she went to the Peak during the day, she would be stopped by the police. According to the defendant's uncle, his niece had a slight mental illness. The magistrate postponed the case for seven days to allow a doctor to examine the defendant to determine if she was suffering from mental illness before sentencing.</p>

One of the tour guides, named Meng Beiqiu (26 years old, registered as Liang Munian in the store), was frowning and had a sorrowful expression. When a companion asked her the reason, she hesitated and then entrusted a letter to her companion to be sent back to the owner of the Hong Kong Tourist Guide Agency. The companion noticed that Meng had suddenly changed her usual behavior and paid a little attention to her. At around 4 a.m., the tour guides had taken off their clothes and gone to bed. Meng also pretended to be asleep. Unexpectedly, Meng took advantage of the fact that no one was aware and suddenly took opium paste, intending to end her life. After taking it, she was poisoned and moaned [and] tossed and turned in bed, which awakened her companions. Everyone saw that [her] mouth was spitting white foam, and there was an opium pipe nearby. Everyone knew that she had taken poison, so they quickly informed the manager of the room and called for an ambulance to the scene, and sent her to Queen Mary Hospital for rescue. At the same time, several detectives went to investigate.

It was also taken to Queen Mary Hospital. Fortunately, she did not take too much poison. After the doctor washed her stomach, she had a little sense of consciousness and was not in danger of losing her life.</p>

<p>This Disease is Most Prevalent in Hong Kong Among Eastern Ports</p>
<p>On Friday last week, five more cases of cholera occurred in Hong Kong. The disease has reached sixty-seven cases this year. Other disease reports include three cases of enteric fever, one case of measles, one case of encephalitis, seven cases of dysentery, and thirty-five cases of tuberculosis.

<h3 id="e58">Police Detectives Will Conduct Random Checks on Pedestrians to Maintain Public Order <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>If Encountered, Do Not Attempt to Evade Inspection, Otherwise Police Detectives May Fire to Stop You</p>
<p>—If An Incident Occurs, Seek A Safe Zone For Avoidance—</p>
<p>Recently, in various places in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, banditry has been rampant, with murders and robberies occurring frequently. Recently, it has intensified, and even occurred on major thoroughfares, with shootings and resistance to arrest. Recently in Hong Kong, Chinese Detective Yin Wen was shot and fatally wounded by bandits. At the same time, several pedestrians were injured by stray bullets. On the sea side, in the robbery case at Yongxiang Gold Store on Shanghai Street, a female servant was also killed on the spot by stray bullets. Since these bloody cases have occurred continuously, the public has been greatly shocked. The police authorities have taken remedial measures, ordering all police detectives to increase the power of their duties. In the future, if bandits forcibly rob and rob, and if police detectives attempt to intervene, but they immediately run away, regardless of whether they are carrying guns or sharp objects, the police detectives have the right to fire to stop them. Police detectives may conduct random checks on anyone at any time and must not resist or attempt to evade or avoid such actions. Otherwise, in order to enforce their duties and prevent sudden attacks by bandits, the police detectives may fire at the person being checked. Previously, no matter what happened on the streets, passers-by, driven by curiosity, often liked to stop and watch what was happening. As a result, more and more spectators gathered. This not only hindered traffic but was also dangerous for the passers-by themselves. If there is a battle between police and bandits, it is inevitable that they will be affected. The police authorities have stated that if a robbery or pursuit occurs, passers-by should immediately avoid it in a safe zone and must not flee in panic. In this way, on the one hand, it can avoid obstructing the progress of police detectives in arresting bandits, and on the other hand, it can prevent oneself from suffering an unexpected disaster. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will understand the police's painstaking efforts to curb banditry and provide police detectives with convenience to exercise their powers within the possible scope.</p>

<p>— Li Yueqin</p>
<p>A Record of the Morning Bell Sports Association's Fundraising for the Comfort of Soldiers in Eastern Guangdong</p>
<p>One dim dusk, in a dilapidated building, two rows of benches were placed side by side. Nine members of the preparatory committee for the Morning Bell Sports Association's fundraising campaign to comfort soldiers in Eastern Guangdong sat closely together, each wearing a solemn and tense expression. The question of "how to expand the comfort work" permeated the hearts of all nine, who were thinking deeply together.</p>
<p>A heated discussion began after the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting. A tense atmosphere enveloped the entire venue, suffocating everyone's breathing. Expanding the fundraising campaign for comfort items became the central issue.</p>
<p>A female worker wearing a dark blue serge cheongsam spoke with a very determined voice:</p>
<p>"In order to ensure that this fundraising campaign can achieve greater success, it is necessary to contact various factory owners to obtain assistance and convenience from all parties."</p>
<p>Her powerful tone captured everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Immediately following, another important proposal was made:</p>
<p>"We should deepen this fundraising campaign into the masses and transform it into a conscious action of the masses. Therefore, how to raise the enthusiasm of the masses to a high level is something we cannot ignore. I believe that conducting a competition for the fundraising of comfort items is an important step in raising the enthusiasm of the masses."</p>
<p>These two important proposals were immediately approved by the entire group.</p>
<p>With the work decided, the hearts of each member were extraordinarily lively. They had a strong common belief: as long as they worked hard, excellent results would surely be obtained by them.</p>
<p>The next morning, the sun kissed the old signboard of the ×× Weaving Factory, but it did not have the opportunity to greet the people who were enthusiastically raising funds for comfort items. The factory was surrounded by five or six hundred male and female workers, and every gaze was drawn to the loud voice of the speaker.</p>
<p>A speaker stood upright, his voice so powerful, stirring everyone's emotions:</p>
<p>"...Our lives as workers are hard enough! But our compatriots in the occupied areas are living even more miserable lives than pigs and dogs: × and ××, they are our dear compatriots, and they have our parents and wives... Every soldier fighting on the front lines was raised by parents, and they abandon their families to fight the × people in order to save those innocent compatriots and defend the Republic of China..."</p>
<p>Every impassioned and powerful word struck the hearts of the five or six hundred workers. Their breathing was so short and suffocated. A bloody picture flickered in their eyes, and a tense emotion pressed on their lungs. No, they were so determined. The suffering of their compatriots was deeply engraved in their minds.</p>
<p>"I donate half a dozen towels!" "Hey, a dozen toothbrushes here!" "And I donate four dimes!" The voices were so noisy.</p>
<p>"I also donate..." A worker who used to be a factory owner and foreman... his...</p>
<p>Under such enthusiastic donations, a glorious page in the history of the factory was opened.</p>
<p>The propagandists showed smiling faces, deeply moved by the workers' donations. Similarly, they were also extremely grateful for the factory owner's wisdom in being willing to allocate thirty minutes of work time to facilitate the promotion of fundraising for comfort items.</p>
<p>Rubber shoes, towels, and medicines piled up in a corner on the east side of the wall, like the pyramids of ancient Egypt. But because people were busy piling them up, they appeared chaotic and unstable. However, people routinely piled them up like this every night, continuing until late at night.</p>
<p>This large-scale fundraising not only obtained donations from many backward lower-class people, but also some factory workers spontaneously launched a charity campaign, and some even requested that the money left over from purchasing national salvation bonds in the past be donated to the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>This is such a moving page! In the giant tide of the salvation movement in Hong Kong, the Morning Bell Sports Association appeared before people in a new and striking posture!</p>
<p>After two or three months of the war... things were different, especially for the lower classes. They had wielded their strength to fight for the liberation of the nation!</p>

<h3 id="e62">Dutch Anthropologist Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss Java Man and Peking Man; Research on Which is the Most Ancient Human Remains a Mystery; Java Ape-Man Said to Be More Ancient <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>There are said to be two of the world's most ancient human races, one being "Java Ape-Man" and the other being "Peking Man". But which is the most ancient remains a mystery to this day. According to Dr. Gonneswart, a famous Dutch anthropologist, "Java Ape-Man" is more ancient. Mr. Gonneswart was funded by the Ebenalki Academy to collect materials and conduct research in Beiping. After staying in Beiping for four months, he went to Java. He passed through Hong Kong yesterday. It is said that there has been repeated controversy over whether "Java Ape-Man" and "Peking Man" are human. He insisted on the theory that the two kinds of people are closely related. After four months of research in Beiping, he believes that his theory is correct. "Java Ape-Man" is very similar to apes, and its most obvious feature is its flat skull, with a brain only half the size of modern humans. It has been proven that "Java Ape-Man" could use stone tools, and "Peking Man" could also use stone tools. Therefore, these two kinds of people are indeed human. Mr. Gonneswart finally said that "Java Ape-Man" migrated to Java from South China. The elephant-like animals of Malaya and other places also originated in South China, passing through Taiwan, the Philippines, and reaching Borneo and Java. The fossils discovered in Java can be used as proof. Four hundred thousand years ago, the Chinese sea was originally land. It only became the current terrain after it subsided.</p>

<p>Huang Chaotang (37 years old), a lace worker, was charged by Fraser of the Chinese Civil Affairs Department in the Kowloon Magistracy yesterday morning with sheltering an unregistered maidservant Zheng Yan (18 years old) and assaulting her. During the interrogation, Zheng Yan stated that two years ago, her mother sold her to the defendant as a concubine for $120 in her hometown. Although she had shared a bed with the defendant for two nights, she was still a virgin. However, since she came to Hong Kong with the defendant, she had to work at home all day long, serving like a maidservant. She even had to eat separately from her husband (i.e., the defendant) for breakfast and dinner. At 5:00 PM on May 22nd, the defendant needed her to change his clothes, but she was unable to do so. The defendant and his wife then beat her with a rattan cane. She reported the matter to the police station. The defendant stated in court that he did not intentionally beat the plaintiff, it was just a momentary anger. He also stated that the plaintiff was his concubine and was not treated like a maidservant. The judge then ordered the case to be adjourned for one month so that the defendant could produce evidence of his marriage to the plaintiff as proof.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Shen Bao Cup Basketball Charity Match: Zhonghua Defeats Southwest, Zhi Xing Easily Defeats Hua Xiong <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>In the first match of the Shen Bao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Match last night, Southwest played against Zhonghua. Although Southwest was not a strong team and its fighting power was inferior to Zhonghua, all players were able to bravely go forward and stick to the end, so the competition was very fierce. At times, they posed a fierce threat to Zhonghua. Ye Peizhi suddenly launched a surprise attack, and Zhu Xianzhi and Wu Ruixin responded on both sides. In addition, Li Chanxiang and He Wanxiang strongly resisted the incoming forces. Therefore, although Zhonghua had Liu Shouguang, Li Chunyu, and Ye Muzhen launching attacks from three routes, they also felt the pressure. However, Zhonghua's players were experienced and had better coordination, which was able to achieve a flanking effect. Finally, they won with a score of 32 to 14. In terms of individual skills, Ye Muzhen was the most active on the Zhonghua side, and Liu Shouguang and Li Chunyu did their best. Rao Huizhen's defense was slightly inferior, and He Jingxiong was quite insightful. Wu Ruixin and Ye Peizhi were the best on the Southwest side, and the rest were also commendable for their bravery.</p>
<p>After the two armies clashed, Wu Ruixin scored on a free throw. Liu Shouguang and Ye Muzhen of Zhonghua launched counterattacks from both sides. Peizhi scored a long shot. From then on, each team had its gains. At the end of the first quarter, Zhonghua led with 9 to 7. Southwest, having suffered an initial setback, mobilized its entire army in an attempt to counterattack. However, Zhonghua's momentum was like a rainbow. Ye Muzhen, Liu Shouguang, and Li Chunyu's long and close shots were all successful. Although the Southwest players struggled hard, they still fell behind with a score of 12 to 19 due to the disparity in strength. Switching sides, Zhonghua took advantage of their victory and frequently put pressure on Southwest. Southwest struggled to resist, but eventually failed with a score of 14 to 22 due to the disparity in strength.</p>

<p>In the second match, Zhi Xing played against Hua Xiong. Most of the players under Zhi Xing were veterans, while Hua Xiong was a newborn calf. Compared with each other, the strength was very different. After the two sides engaged in battle, Hua Wei both fell behind and were caught in a storm. In the first half, Chen Qixia alone scored two points. In the second half, Lei Yuegui showed great courage and won back several points, but there was no other progress. Finally, they lost with a score of 14 to 34. In terms of the skills of both sides, Zhi Xing's coordination was tacit. Chen Rongtang's long and close shots were successful. He Defang and Wen Weiqiong were also able to cooperate with each other. Sun Yuming and Lin Shaoping strongly resisted Lei Yuegui's offense. Li Shizhen was good at both offense and defense. Hua Xiong's passing was inaccurate, and many of their shots were off target. Lei Yuegui was the most valiant among the forwards, but she was often intercepted by the opponent, and there was no way to progress. Peng Taoxiu and Luo Wensu were quite active, but their strength did not match their intentions, and the rest were not outstanding, and their coordination was not perfect. The disparity in strength led to the defeat.</p>
<p>After the war broke out, He Defang opened the scoring first. Chen Rongtang's shots were accurate and smooth, scoring twelve consecutive points. Li Baozhen and He Defang's attacks from both sides were successful again. Hua Xiong struggled hard, and Chen Qixia finally scored two points. However, Zhi Xing's military appearance was prosperous, leading with a score of 27 to 2. Switching sides, Hua Xiong hoped to counterattack. Lei Yuegui bravely tried to score, and made some gains, but Zhi Xing's Chen Rongtang launched arrows and crossbows together, still leading with a score of 36 to 6. Lei Yuegui made a comeback and won back several points, but it was of no avail. At the end of the game, Zhi Xing won with a score of 34 to 14.</p>

<p>He worked at Hongqiao Airport before the War of Resistance; He starred in the film "Sea Burial" during the National Games; This sudden bad news is unknown whether it is true or false. When the banner of the War of Resistance shone with a different kind of brilliance on the 5,000-year-old soil of China, enthusiastic young people from all provinces and regions shouldered their guns, braved the artillery fire, and marched to the front lines.</p>
<p>The songs of the War of Resistance resounded through every desolate village. Rusted guns and bayonets were wiped bright and sparkled.</p>
<p>At this time, people from all walks of life, men and women, joined the military, especially intellectuals, who abandoned their books and rushed to the army.</p>
<p>In the sports world, many famous athletes such as "Little Black Ash" Chen Zhenhe, pole vault king Fu Baolu, and Wang He, the second place in the National Games pole vault, joined the Chinese Air Force to serve the country.</p>
<p>The joining of these famous sports athletes in the Air Force not only showed that outstanding members of the Chinese nation participated in the War of Resistance, but also showed that they were not only "sports stars" but also the most combative members participating in the national War of Resistance.</p>
<p>A few days ago, our newspaper published the bad news that Fu Baolu was martyred in air combat in Guilin. We hope that this unfortunate news is just a rumor. Now let me tell the reader a little about the daily life of this air force soldier.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu, with brown curly hair, a thin but spirited face, a small mustache on his mouth, and not very tall but very strong,</p>
<p>His personality is very irritable, but he is exceptionally straightforward.</p>
<p>He grew up in Harbin. His father was from Northeast China and his mother was Russian. He also has a younger brother and two younger sisters in his family. Now his whole family is in Shanghai, running a ginseng shop on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Because of this relationship, Fu Baolu not only speaks fluent Russian, but also fluent English.</p>
<p>If you don't know Fu Baolu's background, you will find a foreign flavor in him, and you may guess that he is not Chinese. However, among friends or on the road, if someone rashly says that he is Russian, he will immediately get angry when he hears it, and even does not hesitate to fight you, at least he has to tell you clearly that he is a Chinese Harbin native.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu likes to drink very much. After drinking, his temper is sometimes very rude, but he has a very kind heart. Before the war, he worked at Hongqiao Airport. Once, he was half drunk, driving a car with Jin Yan and many other friends, and drove to Hongqiao Airport at a speed of fifty or sixty yards. On the way, he almost collided with another truck, scaring everyone in the car to scream.</p>
<p>He once married a very beautiful Russian wife, but later the two separated. He often misses his foreign wife when he gets drunk, and nervously sheds tears. When he wakes up, his friends shame him.</p>
<p>During the National Games, Wang He wanted to compete with Fu Baolu for the first place in the pole vault. That night, Zhu He turned over and over and couldn't sleep. (He once returned to Shanghai and is now back in the Air Force.) But Fu Baolu still won the first place the next day. In fact, Fu Baolu did not work hard. Some people said that if Fu Baolu could work a little harder, he would not be "nameless" in the World Games.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu also tasted the taste of movies. At that time, Wang Bin was in Tianyi Company and wrote a script himself called "Sea Burial", and decided to invite Fu to star in it, as well as Liu Liying and others to co-star in this film.</p>
<p>At that time, Fu Baolu was really busy. He attended the National Games during the day and filmed "Sea Burial" at night. Later, this film was shown at the Xinguang Grand Theater before the National Games ended.</p>
<p>After the Chinese army withdrew westward, he also left Shanghai. Unexpectedly, such an unexpected bad news came. We can only bless this Air Force soldier to remain safe.</p>
<h3 id="e88">From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Lao</p>
<p>—A Precious History of Sports—</p>
<p>The Origin of the Olympic Games</p>
<p>The National Festivals of Greece made a great contribution to sports, because they regarded competing to entertain the gods as the most prosperous ceremony in the country. In the first half of the sixth century BC, there were four major competition festivals, namely Pythia, Isthmia, Nemea, and Olympia, among which Olympia was the most important. Regarding the origin of the Olympic Games, some say that King Lyghtu blessed Zeus (the highest god of Greece) in order to maintain peace on the entire island of Greece, some say that Heracles commemorated his father Zeus for destroying the monster clan, some advocate that it is closely related to the olive tree god, and some are based on the love affair set by the poet Pindar. There are many different opinions. Such an investigation into the origin of the Olympic Games is nothing more than a legend of arsenic. In fact, due to geographical reasons, Greece was divided into many city-states. In order to maintain peace, it organized a large-scale religious alliance competition. As for who was the founder of the competition, the orators in Athens at that time could not prove it. Even Homer, who was called the saint of poetry in ancient times, did not have a clear description and the origin of the festival in his epic poems, but only mentioned that athletes from all over the world gathered during the festival and their performance records. According to archaeologists, the sacrificial hall of the Olympic stadium that was recently excavated was at least a thousand years ago, so the first masters of this meeting were not the powerful and domineering Dorian people, but the powerless Elis people. When Lusgns formulated the constitution, he stipulated that the Olympic winner should be the annual law of Greece, so in 770 BC, the winner of the first sprint competition was called Koredos, and historians regarded him as the beginning of Greek history.</p>
<p>Olympia was originally the name of a village, located on the Peloponesus peninsula at the southern tip of Greece. To the west of the island is the small country of Elis. From the Ionian coast, there is a river called Alpheus flowing in. There is a village called Olympia by the river. The village is ten miles away from the sea. There are the Temple of Zeus, sacrificial halls, and tombs on the hills of the village, in which are placed the greatest Greek sculptures,</p>
<p>The statue of Zeus, the tombs of other gods, statues of heroes, statues of winners, and precious contributions from the citizens were all placed in the sacrificial hall. Outside the east wall of the shrine are the stadium and the horse racing track. Each time the festival gathered athletes from various countries, competing with each other, showing their skills, and serving as the only grand ceremony for the country to worship the gods, so the meeting in front of the sacrificial hall in Olympia was called Olympic Games, and the general meeting was held every four years, and the four years in between was called Olympiad.</p>
