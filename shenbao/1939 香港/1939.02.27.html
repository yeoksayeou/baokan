<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">国了上兩個嚴重問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近日國際形勢發展，有兩點特別値得注視，一爲西班牙戰局的急轉直下，一爲日本在遠東之瘋狂胃險，兩者都可窺見法西斯侵略陣綫之新的攻勢，及世界大戰危機提前擴大的傾向，此種事態究將演變到何種程度，將予中國與世界以何種影響，完全要看民主和平陣線尤其是英法兩國的態度如何，方可獲得比較肯定的論斷。因此，吾人今日有一嚴重之問題，卽在此種形勢之下，英法兩國統治者將向何處去？</p>
<p>西班牙戰事，原係西班牙民主共和政府，肅淸佛朗哥領導的法西斯叛軍的戰爭；西政府這種戰爭在國內獲得最大多數擁護民主政治愛好自由平等的全國人民熱烈擁護，在國際亦能爲全世界愛護民主和平各國人士的同情援助，反之，佛朗哥領導的法西斯叛軍，則外受意德侵略者的驅策，內違全國人民公意，本來沒有僥倖獲勝的可能。然而因爲民主和平國家尤其是英法統治者的妥協政策，在「不千涉主義」的口號之下，一面阻止了西班牙政府依法向英法美蘇各國購運彈械軍需物品，一面縱容德意兩國不斷調遣海陸空軍及一切軍火軍需援助西叛軍作戰，卒至有最近加泰降尼亞之陷落，使西班牙合法政府的抗戰遭遇空前的危難。然而英法統治者在此時如果能够洞鑒於縱容侵略者的危機，斷然放棄妥協政策，以實力援助西政府制裁叛軍及其指揮者意德兩國當局，則以意德色厲內荏之事實而言，不僅西局可以轉危爲安，而歐洲形勢亦有轉向安定的希望。不意英法統治者重視本身階級利益逾於國家與世界利益，卒至採取與意德侵略者進一步妥協的政策，表面上以承認西叛軍及其政權的方式，企圖壓迫西政府，結朿西戰，實現暫時的和平。可惜此種政策結果，不僅直接犧牲西班牙，而且意德於在西獲勝之後，羽毛益盛，氣焰益高，歐局亦將從茲愈趨危岌，而大戰危機乃不能不更加迫近與擴大！</p>
<p>日本侵略者最近在遠東之擴大胃險，如强佔海南島，轟炸香港新界羅湖，及刦奪上海租界的××，××××××××、而所以適於此時提前發動者，英法統治者對西班牙問題妥協政策變本加厲之實施，實爲其最主要的動機！日本侵略者在遠東之胃險行動，一方面爲意德侵畧者在歐洲實施新攻略的先聲，另一方面則爲「太平洋上九一八」的警號：其目的第一步固在×××××××××××××××××，要求英法當局放棄援華政策及壓迫我國停止抗戰，其第二步則爲「太平洋霸權戰」的展開，受威脅者將不僅限於香港新嘉坡安南緬甸及菲列賓等處而巳，這是不可避免的必然趨勢。一切從法西斯侵略者鐵腕下苟全的希望，均將爲血淚事實所粉碎無遺。如何防備此種危機，一方面固有賴於中華民族抗日戰爭的英勇堅持，另一方面則仍有賴於和平民主國家尤其是英法統治者的互相團結合作，放棄任何妥協政策，積極推進民主和平陣綫，制裁法西斯侵略者。</p>
<p>依據最近情報，英法對於遠東侵略者之新的胃險，業已予以密切的注意，認爲情勢至爲嚴重。日本各報且於本月二十五日刊載一來自德方的消息，謂英國業已完成其太平洋的防衛計劃，並謂新嘉披達爾文與新畿內亞已連成一拒抗攻襲的防綫。又據路透社本月廿六日訊，英國政府將於下星期三由新嘉披調派英印軍及重砲隊永駐印度洋與馬六甲海峽間歐亞交通據點的檳榔島。而同日河內電傳巴黎方面消息，謂法國車事技術專家經已擬就如何保衛安南的各種計劃。法衆院海軍委會副主席波斯基特氏，最近鑒於日本有與暹羅聯合進攻安南之可能，亦曾力請法國加强法屬安南的防務。這些消息大致都屬可靠，足見英法統治者對於遠東方面的積極態度。然而我們要認淸日德意三大侵略者的胃險，在地域上固有歐菲和東亞的分別，在事實上則同屬向英法統治者××××以實現其新要求爲目的，所以英法統治者决無在歐洲妥協××而在遠東獨能堅强獲勝的可能。因此，我們固然希望英法對遠東方面能够迅取堅强反抗侵略的政策，積極增强遠東方面的軍事防衛力量，使色厲內荏危機四伏的日本侵畧者的胃險勒索陰謀完全失敗；但是更希望英法兩國人民督促其政府迅速放棄貽害國家與世界的妥協政策，全面實施聯合民主和平國家抵抗法西斯侵略的行動。因爲惟有這樣才能保障英法在歐洲和遠東的地位與威信，也惟有這樣才能澈底縮小及消滅世界大戰的危機，而促進各國困難的合理解决及各國利益的合理發展。</p>
<h3 id="c2">長沙的新姿態 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>緊接着廣州失陷，武澳撤退，又一度引起世人極大注意，幷寄以無限同情的長沙大火，距今雖僅數月，爲時無多，但該省地方當局及社會人士，根據政府一面抗戰一面建國的定策，積極從事善後工作，推動復興計劃，彷彿鳳凰在火中槃後復活之長沙，她顯然將在抗建大業巨流奔進中早呈現其新姿態。</p>
<p>記者從汨羅折囘長沙約在淸晨四點鐘下車。一個苦力引着去找旅館，走了幾條不知名的大街小巷，雖然路面已收拾得很整潔，可以安步如常；但那時東方還未發白，天上又下着毛毛雨，看看兩旁燒不了的頹壁高牆，顫巍巍的好像就要迎頭倒下，加上路中警察崗亭上掛着的煤油燈，又是那樣半明半滅的發着幽光，偶然踏重了脚步，還惹得一聲聲空谷似的囘響。臨此慘澹幽暗的環境，聞此格外凄淸的聲音，一種孤寂黑暗得令人生長的感覺不禁頻頻襲上心來。</p>
<p>一會兒迎面遇着一大隊人馬，蹄聲得得，人影幢幢，光景約有一營人數，一伍跟一伍地從我們右邊走過去。隊首誠如啣枚急走，一語不發，直到隊末才聽見一個官長操着東北口音叱罵了列兵一句：『背着手幹什麼！』好個『背着手幹什麽！』這不僅可想像該部平時的軍風紀，是怎樣的講究，同時還在我們周遭岑寂黑暗的空氣裏，似乎敲上一聲響亮的晨鐘！</p>
<p>不錯，眞的晨鐘果然響了，天也漸漸地亮起來了。原來緊接着黑暗之後，的的確確是「光明」！</p>
<p>將行李放在中山路財政廳斜對過的一個旅館裏，踏着從薄雲中透射在大地上的晨，抱着想看而不忍看的矛盾心情，復信步走到各災區去視察。其實，災區一出門就是；而且燒得正如俗謂「長沙是一片」的一片，動脚時還不知道先去那一區的好。後來决定：反正信步任其所之，不如走着看着再說。</p>
<p>現在已經走了看了，因爲災區之特別廣大，災情之十分慘重，若要詳爲叙述，眞恐罄竹難書，所以只好用歸納方法，扼要的加以說一說了：</p>
<p>城區中部，除中山東路國貨陳列館附近的財政廳。劇院及民房二三十家尙倖存者外，餘如走馬樓，皇倉街，藥王街等大街小巷的房屋，已究全燒平，其慘狀與八一三滬戰時被燬于戰火的閘北南市，及屢經×機投彈燃燒的桂林災區相伯仲。西部如太平街，大西門，小西門一帶，亦全成瓦礫場。南部除碧湘街兩廠坪迥龍山殘留一部分外，其餘均吿焚如。此外，尙有很多不及視察之地區，十之八九亦皆夷爲平地。總而言之，數千年楚國故都已淪爲實際上之一片焦土！</p>
<p>政府機關：財敎兩廳金甌無恙，民廳尙燒剩一部，餘如省政府，電報局，電話局等等，亦同歸于盡。公共塲所：建築宏大百貨雜陳之國貨陳列館，樓宇巍巍風景幽美之天心閣，除國貨館稍存鋼泥殘骸勉供少數難民一住外，其餘無限風光均爲無情大火所葬送。紡紗廠，電燈公司及一部分外人產業，與民居望衡對宇亦不免慘遭池魚之殃。散居各區街之廟宇寺院，菩薩塑像，大多數亦與火神結不解緣，一同搗手升了天；惟有「天符菩薩」尙留凡塵，愚民無知，迷信威靈，故二時香火特盛。</p>
<p>此次畏沙浩刧，其損失概數，據該市火災臨時救濟委員會綜合調查所得，統計房屋梀數原有者三萬一千八百八十四棟，全　者二萬零八百三十八棟，牟　者二百九十棟，現有者一萬零七百四十七棟，全市約燬去三分之二强。</p>
<p>大火中死亡人口，就各機關團體負責掩埋者計，共有六百五十六具。但其中繞死凍死餓死病死者均有。燒死者究佔多少，難于確定，大約當在五百人上下。當中類似傷兵屍體共二百二十名：至其餘病死餓死凍死者中亦多傷病兵（洮散失踪者尙不在內），殊堪憫惜！亟望中央與各戰區責任機關，以後對於傷兵之處理，應負全責，力謀妥善，以保陣此輩傷病戰士之安全，卽所以保留富有戰鬥經驗之兵員，與夫提高國民抗戰之情緒。又受傷人數，以長沙市政府統計約有二十七人，流離人數約爲二十五萬四千五百零七人。</p>
<p>財產損失，目前尙無正確數宇。若依長沙市政府就所轄八鎭四鄉估計，則房屋損失共達八于九百零三萬三千八百八十元，貨物損失共五千五百八十九萬三千零十元，實際當不止此。有謂長沙市面積計二十一方里，合七十萬方丈，每方丈建築費平均約四百元，全部損失應爲二億八千萬元。比七十萬方丈面積中，若以其十分之一地位爲貨物　集地，每平方丈以百元計算，則貨物損失當爲七千萬元。其他電話電燈土程，公私設備，及直接之營業損失與救濟費等約五千萬元，總數當達三億數千萬元。</p>
<p>當大火延燒時，有許多軍政負責人如省府主席張治中等，均未離開長沙，從中設法補救：尤其蔣委晨長于接電後立刻親臨鎮撫，並採取如下四項處置：一，逮捕首事有關人員，依法嚴懲；二，撥付巨欵，救濟被難民衆；三，調集重兵，咖緊農沙防衛；四，改組地方軍警機構，辦理一切善後。</p>
<p>當有第×戰區陳司令長官立調×××軍團長俞濟時氏率部警倫長（沙）株（州），極力維持辦序恢復交通：政治部亦派大批工作人員來長沙秩理撫卹災民工作；第九戰區政工大隊亦開入長沙辦理災區善後；還有從湘鄉星夜趕來之湖南民衆抗戰統一委員會工作幹部大隊（隊員是湖南高中學生集中訓練的戰地服務團改編的，他們都是自願到前線服務的熱情靑年）等等，他們都各施展出生龍活虎般的身手，雷厲風行地去實現蔣委員長手訂的那四項善後原則。當時那種工作緊張的景象，簡直好似剛被一把野火將地軀殼燒得灰燼無餘的長沙，重新又在精神上將她活生生的救轉過來。</p>
<p>首先，火災負責人員省會警備司令　悌，省會警備旅第二團團長徐崑及省會警察局長文重孚等三犯，經湘省府遵令逮送軍事委員會，組織高等軍法會審，判處死刑，幷已執行。同時，保安處長徐權亦撤職查辦，長沙市長席楚霖亦免職留任，省主席張治中氏自感用人失察，深自引咎，電請中央嚴予處分，奉令革職留千責成善後。於是一般被災市民之憤恨，因得稍資平復。</p>
<p>其次，關于善後事宜，一方面迅速組成長沙巿大火臨時救濟委員會，以擴大臨時救濟；經費確定爲五十萬元（內蔣委員畏發二十萬元，湘省府籌撥三十萬元）設立災民收容所多處，臨時市場及施飯塲多處，以供給災民不願離省者之食宿；如不在省會，而在敎育廳于災前登記之疎散目的地者，則按路程遠近，以每三十里給洋二角五分計算，外幷加洋三角，以資救濟。凡欲經營小本生意者，則貨款十元。又十二月九日曾發五元一次之急賑，事先估計領此急賑者，至多不過兩三萬人，結果超出預定數約兩倍，多發賑欵數十萬元。總計災民得到救濟者共十一萬數千人，以長沙過去人口三十萬計算，尙有十數萬人在國家恩澤之外。</p>
<p>刻下長沙雖大半成爲廢壞，但以前綫情勢好轉，再加生活所驅，故人民柏　囘城者日多，在廢墟上架起臨時的住屋，有些地區人口反較大火前增加，頗是繁榮氣象。但讓人口過度集中，又是極危險的事，且災後×機曾往投彈一次，故省府又不得不設法另爲安頓。</p>
<p>關于長沙永久建設負責機關，也成立了長沙市善後建設委員會，由二十七年湖南建設公債項下撥充基金一千萬元，建設專家亦已羅致，比種工作之第一個表現，便是建設新長沙區計劃之市徵集。據該會主任委員張治中氏談：『惟現今尙屬一種計劃，賞行尙非其時』。本來我們的對日戰爭，短期內决難澈底解决。我們一切新的建設事業，須作較長久較實際的打算。換句話說，抗戰中新長沙的建設，其一切設計應以軍事爲中心，不僅建設有空防設備的新式優美都市，而是適于長期抗戰需要的軍事堡壘。以免重蹈京滬建設被人譏爲「無圍墻的花園」之覆轍，徒供野獸踐踏。最後要叙述到的，就是起火原因的眞相，也是我想寫這篇東西的要點；雖然這不是一件容易的事。好在起火原因，已經各方調查公布：一、由於地方軍警負責者誤信流言，事前凖備不周，臨時躁急慌張之所致；二、由於曾從事破壞凖備之人員，及人民（自衛團員丁森等）鑑于×機之連日轟炸……激于民族義憤，以爲××將至，乃卽自焚其屋，遂致將凖備工作變爲行動，於是一處起火，到處發動，以致一發而不可收拾。</p>
<p>在「大較原則」上說，長沙起火的主因，確在上述兩點；不過事實如何演進　禍機如何構成？目前似尙難作具體之解答。然奸人乘機虛構，散佈謠言，傳說紛紜，當然亦屬不妥。</p>
<p>其實，長沙這次大火，嚴格的追究其厲階禍首，歸根結底，當然是『日本××』。長沙大火所釀成的巨大犧牲與損失，實應記人日×對我侵略攘奪的總賬，我們應于爭取抗戰勝利中，去和它一總淸算。反之，屬於我們方面對於火災應負　尸咎的人，其動機旣在「免資敵用」，「激于義憤」……那末，我們略跡原心，對其犯罪行爲，似可歸併於「君子之過」之論列，多少不無可諒之點。基此意義，特將所聞起火具體事由，擇其較近情理者，大槪紀如下：</p>
<p>先是，我軍於十一月十一日退出岳陽，×仍沿鐵路線向南進犯。次晨（十二日）長沙卽謠　緊與，人心浮動。在軍事部署上，我軍退出岳　時，由×旅長率部當任掩護工作，當派×團長率勁旅仍於十一日深夜襲擊岳陽近郊某堅强敵陣，幷約於達成某種任務後，卽迅於次晨趕返某地復命。×團長作戰素極英勇，此次尤抱定必死决心，當夜果率部奮勇襲×，屢進屢退，前仆後繼。終于攻入×陣，正擬按計撤退，不料因血戰過久，時已天亮，×機突飛上空大肆轟炸，×砲亦集中該陣猛烈轟擊矣。于是×團長及所餘不到三分之一之殘部，竟不得不暫就原陣以掩護抵抗，息而待×方火力稍弱時，再行衝出。事處無奈，實亦無可如何也。</p>
<p>×旅長在某地枕戈達旦，逾時尙無回昔，私衷忐忑所至，遂對×團長及所部漸興「去時容易歸時難」之念。嗣得聯絡兵之報告，謂已攻入×陣，惟不復攻出。于是更認該部必全作壯烈之犧牲。且×旅畏身旁餘兵無多。恐×乘勢掩至，匪但身陷重圍，且將無以報命；乃念行軍　退汩羅，速電長沙報吿，並以沿途未見我軍佈防，哪長沙緊急戒　！未幾，×團長亦率殘部數十人衝出×陣，趕至汩羅對近，所報情勢，尤較險惡，結果，均爲某司令長官部先後令彼等立返前綫某地直屬上級機關候命參戰。</p>
<p>這里還應該特別指出，×旅長和×團長先後兩次緊急報告，都在十二日的夜裏它們所給予人心惶惶的畏沙之刺激，巳無異是兩道催火符</p>
<p>再在催火符　上潑撤火油的，就是×騎兵　當夜襲至汨羅附近之突兀消息！</p>
<p>縱觀×人向我南北戰塲進犯所採戰略，除常玩「中央突破」，「迂迴包抄」兩套老把戲而外還慣用一種小伎倆：將進佔我每一中心城市時，必另驅蒙偽輕騎數十人，竄我後方嗚槍擾亂，故佈疑陣。脅我退路，如前在南潯路金官橋方面與×相持，而瑞昌正激烈戰鬥之際，初有少數×騎向瑞昌東南地區活動，守軍不明情况，使得乘機竄入新塘埠岷山，而威脅我南潯正南之側背，又武漢撤退時，花園我尙有一部份軍用物待運，亦因應山境內突被小股×騎竄擾，倉猝間亦無法運出。今汨羅附近被×騎竄擾，用意亦不外如此，蓋成則大利，敗則小失也。後雖以平江汨羅以北陣綫兵力充實，壓定陣脚，並將　後進犯之大隊×軍擊退，但滿佈火種一觸卽發之長沙，不幸終以此種無情火油之潑撤，而胃出空前燎原之烈燄矣！</p>
<p>惟在大火以前最最危險的一剎那，亦卽長沙準備對於與軍事有關建築物施行破壞免資×用而認爲已到最後關頭時，此中尚有一最緊要之焦點，卽禍首鄷悌等是否會奉任何與起火有關之侖令？謂其無命令，則傳說紛紛。且鄷悌等至執行槍决時，據尙口呼寃枉。謂其有命令，但關係方又絕對否認，且亦無確鑿証據可憑；誠如所謂『長沙大火功罪究竟如何，只好留待歷史家去研究了。』</p>
<p>一說長沙旣臨戰區，事前準備破壞的時櫗，原說要等×人打到距長沙三十里時，始可開始行動；但鄷悌於驚惶急切中去聽電話，竟將三十里悮成三百里，而汨羅附近距長沙恰是三百里，于是卽鑄成大錯。</p>
<p>戰時傳達命令，所用電報，電話，旗語，號音，筆記，口述等方法，皆各有利弊。前徐州大會戰時，某工兵隊某日下午突接上峯電話，命於其時「烘製豆腐油條」；該隊莫知所以，經再請詢，始悉乃「轟炸蚌埠洋橋」之誤。又馮××先生有次在南陽召集某軍少校以上官佐訓話，幷　各將「戰術」（書名）帶來，後被傳達者誤聽各將「眷屬」帶來，以致鬧出聽訓人果將太太一同帶至講所之笑話。以此例彼，則三百里之誤爲三十里，雖難信所必有，但非不可能之事也。</p>
<p>某長官於某一機會中作閒談，偶及長沙大火事，曾澹然曰：鄷悌等之死，不無爲職務而犧牲之處。語次幷顧在座部下續謂：軍中遇有關係重大之命令，報吿，最好須憑文件執行，至少亦須當時記述，以防有錯悮云云。語雖不着邊際，蓋非無的放矢也。</p>
<p>長沙火災臨時救濟委員會副主任委員田漢先生對大火問題有言：『今日一　　以抗戰爲第一義。旣不必作事後無益之怨尤、以分散我對×人之注意，且當於破磚殘瓦艱難收拾之際……各以最善力量，使畏沙仍能發揮抗戰後方重要支點之作用。』語重心長，不勝有同感焉。</p>

<p>—三月政治報告之一—</p>
<p>國際局勢，也必定日趨險惡、各國眼光遠大的人士、見到這一點、大家都想聯合起來、羣策羣力、設法挽救、世界反　略大會、就是樣這組成的、去年夏天、美國民間發起一個「不參加日本侵略行動委昌會」、宗旨是要使美國人民、自動的不把侵略工具、供給日本、因爲商人雖然沒有參加侵略行動的意思、但是供給日本侵略的用具、實際上等于參加了、這個會是美國民間的運動、與政府無關、他們的出發、不是條約義務、也不是國家的利益、乃是個人的良心與人類的義憤、最近史汀生先生、負担他們的名譽會長、工作必定更活躍、收效也必定更　、日本　閥、或者會藐視這種出于良心和義憤的舉　、但是我們爲和平正義而戰、我們的勝負、不决于疆塲一時的進退、道德勝　、是我們最後勝利的基礎、也是我們最後勝利的預兆、</p>
<p>國際形勢的好轉、當然是因爲我們全國軍民在最高統帥領導之下、精誠團結、忠勇奮鬥所致、而日本政府的野心、自聲明書發表以後、更暴露的格外明顯、也是一個很重要的原因、當九一八事變剛起的時候、我們就向世界宣布、那就是日本無限野心發動的開始、但是世界對於我們的觀察、總是半信半疑、以爲我們宣傳的話、不免言過其窗、及至我們退出武漢、長江下游的利益、盡被×人壟斷去了、而近衛和有田、又正式宣示日本政府的眞面目、各國政府和人民、于是洞燭　奸、態度自然隨着改變了、我國對于近衛有田聲明的意見、蔣委員長已在十二月廿六日公吿述了，他的話、我不必重述、但是我們要特別指出的、就是委員畏的意見與英美法三國照會、不約而行、例如委員長說、『中國若承認近衛的『東亞新秩序』和『日滿支協同關係』、就是將中國的全部領土、變成日本所有的大租界』、英國照會的結論、也是說『英王陛下的政府、不能了解如何近衛公一面聲明日本不要中國割地、並尊重中國主權、同時却又說日本必以武力强迫中國接受　種條件、其作用不外使中國的政治經濟及文化的生活、完全受日本的統制、使日本軍隊無限期的在中國駐防、幾于使內蒙古全部脫離中國而已」，十一月三日近衛廣播演講、他說中日戰事「乃是同類相殘的悲劇」這話說的有道理、可是中日間的悲劇、誰造成的呢悲劇的繼演、又是誰的過失呢、這个實任、不用說、是應當由日本的黷武分子負的、近年日人常好以東方文明的維護者自居、想用東方文化的名義號召、企圖組織東方集團、對付歐美、但是　日本這一次作戰的目的、和他的手段、文明的成分在那要、東方文明的精神又在那裏、實中國是東方文明的泉源、日本的文化、是中國給他的、現在我們抵抗日本的侵略、就是盡我們維護東力文化的責仟、上个月牛津大學敎授、在寫給蔣委員畏的信裏說、「英國人士對于中國文化學術的眞義與價値、過去還不免有些疑惑、但是今日一方面鑒于狹義國家主義的橫暴相仇、一方面感于中國反日態度的莊嚴鎭定、我們不能冉懷疑誰是世界文化的領導者了』、這是世界上著名學者們、關于文化領導地　的論斷、日本明達人士、看了不知作何惑想、</p>
<p>仔細的玫察日本宣傳家所以要在這戰事緊張的時候、高談文化問題、不外乎兩個用意、第一他們要利用東西文化的對峙、驅逐歐美在東亞的勢力、締造日本化的東亞新秩序完成他們夢想的中日『滿』聯繫　一套的把戲、不知東方文化、是我們祖宗千古流傳的精神遺產、我們固然應當竭力的發揚光大、但是發揚方法，不能故步自封、也不在于妄造東西對峙的局面、我們十二分的相信，東西文化的溝通、對於雙方都有裨益、日本人不應該忘記了他們明治維新歷史、所謂明治維新、就是站在東方文明的基礎上、接受西洋的文明、如科學、工程，憲政等等、如果不是明治時代日本有識之士、虛心接受西洋文明、恐怕日本到現在還在幕府分割政治黑暗的時代，現在日本反倒過來、排斥西洋文明了、近衛還說中日不和、是中國受了歐洲大戰後反動潮流的影響所致、但是反動的、究竟是中國呢、還是日本呢，、</p>
<p>日本宣傳家的第二個口號、是共同防共、他們以爲樹起反共或防共的旗轍、就可以淆亂世界的視聽、就可以使世界相信他們的侵略戰爭、是反對共產主義的戰爭了、其實現在誰不知道日本軍閥心目中、祗知掠奪中國的　源、根本無所謂什麽主義、難道一個有歷史有主義的民族，爲自己的生存奮鬥、還须外來的慫恿　、</p>
<p>這次中國在戰事發動前、曾經力求避免、但是避免不了、那末我們除抵抗之外、還有什麽別的方法呢，現在×國的新首相平沼宣言、日本必根據旣定的國策侵略到底、我也不憚重複聲明、中國必根據旣定的國策、抵抗到底</p>
<p>根據以上所述最近三月來×人陰謀的暴露和國際形勢的轉變、我們今後關于外交的應付方針、對于×方一切、除了本着旣定的國策、努力應付以外尤其應該注意宣傳、設法喚醒日本的國民、使他們明嘹他們本國的危機、停止其自殺的行動、以期早日恢復東亞的和平、對于各國、應該本着以德報德、以直報怨的古訓、敦睦邦交、使親者益爲我助、疏者友誼漸增、以期協和萬邦促進國際的合作、對子國聯及力國公約會議的迭次决議案、應該催促盡量實施、對于國除間應有的法律和秩序、以及條約的尊嚴、應該和有關係的各國商洽、共同努力、予以維護、</p>
<p>國際的形勢、雖然已經好轉、我們仍須時時刻刻盡我們最大的努力、不可稍存　倖依賴的心、去年中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會、制定的抗戰建國綱領、所謂抗戰與建國同時並進、一則因爲在日本侵略之中、不抗戰就不能建國、所以這一次的抗戰、將來在歷史上、可以稱爲建國的戰爭、其次因爲在抗戰時期、一切設施、都應力求其合乎國家百年的大計、我們不能因循敷衍、得過且過、我們在這個大時代的工作、必須顧到自前，也須顧到將來、必須有利於抗戰、也須有利於建國、（未完、以下爲內政部分）</p>

<p>【昆明特約航訊】鬥爭的中國，產生了無數英勇的戰士—偉大的中國，創造了無數偉大的史跡！</p>
<p>囘憶淪陷後的東北，產生無數英勇的男女，他們奔走於　山白水之間，不斷地給予×人以打繋。遼寧岫巖縣的農村裏，發出不愿做奴隸的吼聲，『把抗戰當作生活，把游擊隊當作家庭』，從民國二十一年二月到現在，趙老太太天大領導家屬，不斷地以子彈和刺刀，答覆×人的殘暴侵略，更由關外奔走到華北，又由華北奔定到華中，而華南，而南洋，而安南。爲的是什麼：爲祖國而奮鬥，爭光榮。並且，她不但使所　之地的同胞，看淸了東方法西斯××的　獰面目，而且還使她所經之地的　胞們看淸了抗戰建國的勝利前途。</p>
<p>二月二日的晚上，趙老太太洪文國，偕東北救亡總會王愛羣及趙侗部下的王越二人，到了昆明來，這口響亮的洪鐘，這位「游擊隊的母親』，這位革命的女戰士，記者得與她晤面。便如睹火炬的紅光，和她開始談起話豕，如縣洪鐘的響聲。</p>
<p>趙老太太的身軀是很矮小的，皮膚是黃銅色的，皺紋堆滿了一臉，顯示出她鬥爭的　勇痕跡，戴着的呢帽和穿着的旗袍都鐵似地深黑。她的門牙已經脫落了，鬢髮已經如霜了。她的高齡已經五十八歲了。然閃爍在她的面容上的却是靑春的色彩，充溢在她的眼睛裏的也是銳利的光芒。在她的身上，我們看不出絲亳衰頹的老氣，相反地，含蓄在她的身上的却是力！力！力！靑年一樣的力，銅鐵一般的力！</p>
<p>她首先對記者談道：『自『九一八』日本佔據了東北，我不知道什麼，只知日本要亡我們中國，日本是我的×人！於是我捐了家產，拚了身子，組織打擊×人的游擊隊，因爲我想，亡了國的人，有誰保誰呢！只有各人拿一把刀，或一支槍，才能保護自己，不然……我巳經五十八歲了，有什麼想頭！」她喝了口茶，大聲地又接着說：「我不愿　家庭的母親，我要做大衆的母親，所以組織了游擊隊。我的兒女子孫共三十餘口，都把他們送入游擊除，我以爲每個做母親的人，都應該把她的兒女們送到前綫去，與××們拚命，每　母親也應加入前線去。」趙老太太說到這裏，在座的先生們都鼓起掌來。老太太更加大聲地道：「年靑的人既上了前綫，我們老了的人還活着幹嗎？大家都以爲後方是安全地，盡管向着後方跑，可是後方眞是安全嗎？我走過的好些地方，常看到屍描遍野，都是被殘暴的×撰所送侖的，難道那些不是在後方，爲什麼還會炸死呢？我想他們若果上前線去，也許不會如此，我在游擊隊裏，足足幹了七年，由東北而華北而華中，華南，但幷沒有死！」她很得意地　晐了兩聲，接連說着：『我們不要死在床上，不要死在家裏，不要死在後方，我們到前線去！　知前線不一定會使我們死！每個人須要打死一個日本人，犧牲了，算　爲國盡過責任，流了血，這才是中華民國的子孫！大家要打×××帝國主義，抗戰到底，這是誰也知道了，但有許多人只一味高呼口號，沒有實行，因此，這些人一被×人發現，認爲可惡，於是飛機大砲，一齊向他們幹去。我則不然，我要把槍彈幹到日本人的身　才出聲氣！」這時她的喉嚨更提高起來回問記者，讀同她的意見不，當記者正興奮地答覆她這個囘問，方吐出一個「是」字，她又提精會神地接着說：「我到南洋的時候，許多僑胞都來歡迎我，他們中間，多數是些重要人物，我吿訴他們，你們這樣隆重的歡迎我，實在使我難受得很，因　我雖自一九一八」後就與×人常當拚命，可是七年迄今，不但沒有什麽的結果，國家全今反而危險了，我到此地幷非向你們要錢，也不是來向你們宣傳，我來此地，便是帶個祖國已屆危　的消息來給你們，希望你們趕忙囘去救國，甫洋的同胞，對抗戰也很關心，幷且很努力，當時他們便有許多人要跟我回國來加入游擊隊，但因種種關係，我未能允許他們……。』</p>
<p>記者繼問她東北近來的游擊情形如何？她又應聲道：東北的義勇軍游擊隊，紛紛到前綫予×人以打擊，華北的游擊隊，戰於平部，自東北失陷七年以來，我組織的游擊隊，約二萬人，轉戰於東北及華北，由長白山脈轉戰至　行山脈，我的愿望是要大家團結起來，不分黨派，不分南北，大家擁護最高領袖，蔣委員長，我數年來到處傳道，是傳打倒×本帝國主義的道……。她怒顏漸緊張起來，皺紋一堵一堵的變換着，更談道她舉家抗×的悲壯故事。響亮的聲音，傳達出　勇的史蹟，使記者猶如傾聽偉大的朗誦詩。她愈講愈起勁，我愈聽愈入神，我覺得跟我談話的彷彿不是趙老太太，而是西班牙的陶洛列斯，又好像是斯巴達的溪烈娜，又好像是高爾基筆下的一母親」！伯拉奮耶，尼洛娜。</p>
<p>這時，趙老太太跟記奢繼續談到東北事變的前因後果，也追述到甲午之役，以及劉永福將軍領導的台灣抗戰之所以失敗的原因，她的結　是：『由於當時我們中國沒有動員民衆所以才落得背負了『馬關條約』這一面奴隸的大枷』！井痛斥汪兆銘之流的所謂「游而不擊」的澳奸　言之後。她又說「凡是中國人都應該起來站在抗×救國的崗位上，用我們的血肉，保衛祖國的領士，不要躲懶，不要偷安！更不要猶豫　傍徨！你們拿筆桿參加抗戰的人的責任，更比拿槍　參加抗戰的人的責任重大啊！」當記者與她握手吿別的時候，她特別鄭重地說出了如是寶貴的幾句話。</p>
<p>學習　老太太的鬥爭精神，用鬥爭的行動來實踐她老人家給予我們的正確指示吧！</p>

<p>第二期抗戰開始以來，出現了日本侵華軍隊的無法繼續進展，同時更出現了日本軍隊戰鬥力的日趨降落，最近各地日本陸軍空軍將校士兵的反戰叛變和各地偽軍的大舉實行反正及　釀叛亂，就是最　要的說明。</p>
<p>據中央社河曲廿四日電稱，綏遠×軍力量日益削弱，蒙偽軍醞釀反正，偽德王及李逆守信兩部實行改編，號稱十師，實際僅約數千人。由此可見華北偽軍力量的薄弱，及其叛亂反正的尙在繼續醞釀，最近全面抗戰陣謹　長。×軍兵力愈益分散，所頓以救濟其兵力不足之危磯的，主要的就在于編組大量偽軍。現在偽軍內部，旣有如此不穩狀况，自是增加×軍崩潰危機的重要因素。</p>
<p>關於擴大政治工作，積極發動×軍反戰叛變，本報曾再三伸述其重要，同時事勢發展，關於爭取偽軍反正工作，仍應視爲當前政治工作的重大任務之一，不過在這一方面，我們認爲尙有兩點必須注意，即第一，爭取偽申工作須有整個計劃，特別是針對目前日×編組偽軍時所用「反共救民』及『民族獨立』等欺偽口號，須使爭取偽軍工作與宣傳加强國共合作之眞正意　及團結國內各族共求解放的政策配合起來。第二，爭取偽軍反正，必須廣泛　展淪陷區內的政治工作，同時注力於政府權力所及地區民主政冶的實她與民衆生活的改善，以便澈底粉　日×編組偽軍的欺偽宣傳及其險毒的『懷柔政策』。</p>
<h3 id="c39">中日戰爭與防共協定 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 世長譯</p>
<p>ASIATICUS原著·載一月號亞美雜誌</p>
<p>雖然德國的實力，一天一天的擴·大·但是·英·美，法·　方面的堅决政策，仍舊能够阻制法西斯的侵略，中國支持長期抗戰的力量，是香港的主要防務，英國在遠　的地位，是不必悲觀，日本海軍的擴充，因爲陸軍的增强，已經大見削弱；所以，日本海軍地位的任何改進，不能證明日本實力的增加。日本現在已經深深的陷入對華的戰爭，如果歐洲一且義生戰事，它决不能調　陸軍或海軍的主力，攻擊蘇聯，這是毫無疑問的，反之，蘇聯的遠東軍和中國的繼續抗戰，足以威脅日本帝國主義的存在，而同時不必向蘇聯的歐洲部分請求增援。</p>
<p>日本——羅馬，柏林軸心的衰弱基礎——的軟弱不是神秘英測的，去年夏天和蘇聯在西伯利亞邊境的衝突（按指張鼓峯事件），很明顯的表示出來了，日本發動這事件，是想鼓勵法西斯國家在歐洲的活動，同時希望得到柏林和羅馬方面的熱烈援助，但是紙老虎是拆穿了，蘇聯紅軍不但在口頭上，並且在行動上，顯示出願意堅决的應戰，結果是給日本一個悽慘的失收，日本是計算錯誤了，它以爲鑒於當時不安定的世界情勢，蘇聯不會接受西伯利亞邊境的挑戰，　可恥的失敗，也暴露了三角防共協定的功效：法西斯國家間，僅能以威脅他國的方式，互相帮助，不能有實際上的切實援助。當時日本的偵察機報告紅軍的行動，紅軍不但努力推進在張鼓峯方面的陣地，並且實行向整個滿洲邊境推進，正在這個時候，德意勸導日本實施一邊境事件地方化』。結果是很顯而易見的；日本的對華『小戰』已　阻礙了最後對蘇「大戰」的計劃，還有一個結果，這是太平洋區域的有關國家所應該知這的；日本的侵略不諭是由於東京的命令或由當地軍事當局所主動——是可以應用堅决迅速的報復行動來阻止的！</p>
<p>這是不必驚異的，德意兩國——日本好戰的朋友——是領導外交的攻擊，策動對華的「和平』。這種企求着的和平是去年捷克所得到的那一類和平，「調解」的結果必定產生防共協定下的犧牲品，這個協定的簽訂者，可以分爲兩類：主人和管事，後者是卑鄙的『滿洲國』政府，佛朗哥將軍及和日本談判「和平」的任何中國政府，日本現在是極需要人家帮助，得到和平，俾從沒有結束的和力竭的「勝利」中，獲得休息，日本的「征服」區域愈廣大，對付華方正規軍和游擊隊，以及保護交通綫的間題，愈是嚴重，日本愈是不能用軍事的方式達到他所企求的目的，推求國際援助和同　，以反對『共產威脅』的　聲愈是響亮！</p>
<p>日本控制下的中國偽政府，對於維持「共產威脅」的藉口，是有重要的職責的，日本可以利用這種偽組織，呼籲和平，在「佔領」區域內，駐紮軍隊，帮助「膺懲部隊」攻擊「共產黨一，偽政府還有一個重要的職務，日本可以利用它，造成經濟的　斷，通過一切破壞其他國家的貿易和條約利益的法律和條例；但是目前日本尙沒有達到這種目的，日本是極需要可以避免崩潰的和平，所以拒絕了英美的共同調解，這是不足驚奇的。英，美兩國或許能够成立阻制日本在大陸上覇權的國際力量—不論這種力量是怎樣的微小—就是爲了這個理由，日本駁斥英美沒有認識返東的一新事實一，而認德　爲「不偏袒」的國家，可以勸導中國政府向日本求和，以拯救自己，免除共產主義的禍害。</p>
<p>很幸運的，中國一些沒有表示願意這穗和平，反之，中國人民一致堅决的相信，在沒有把日本侵略者完全驪逐出境以前，不能得到眞止的和平，中國爲自由的殊死戰，是阻　日本侵害列强遠東方面利益的唯一有效方法，日本企圖征服中國的失收，是制止日本威脅遠東的其他區域和太平洋的唯一保陣！（續完）</p>

<p>【本報特訊】抗戰發生以後，香港有三個業餘職業團體以嶄新的姿態出現。業餘聯誼社是包括各行各業的職業份子；藝人文員協合的合員多屬洋行的職員。銀行界業餘聯誼合則純粹是銀行界的從　員。提倡正當娛樂，服務社會國家，就是他們共同的目標。</p>
<p>雖然為了語言的自然趨向與職業背景的關係，在表面上有三個團體的分野，其實他們是三位一體，殊途而同歸的姊妹團體。他們三個團體的幹部，在精神上有親密的聯系，在工作上亦互相兼顧，積極企求共同發展。</p>
<p>這個事實，就是說明：祖國在生命線上苦鬥，香港警覺的　胞亦遠離「荒淫與無恥」的一面，而朝向着「嚴肅地工作　」的大道　　。</p>
<p>此次，提倡用新方式，過舊歷年，　三個團體都　過了最大的努力。記者在這裏所要報道的，就是華人文員協會方面的消息：</p>
<p>在「過年」之前，該會分發大量「節約　金封」的紅紙封給會員，每人十個，封面寫着（節省無意識的浪費，加强抗戰建國力量）的動員詞句。該會一百八十餘會員，除自己自由献金外，並應將其他獻金封分送親朋量力獻金這個影嚮，不消說是相廣當泛的。</p>
<p>昨晚七時半，該會在會所舉行獻金禮，行禮如儀後，李漢平致開會詞，旋來賓演說，陳雙玉致答詞。接着，就是最精采的節目了。熱心的會員踴躍地將獻金封獻上來，在拿聲鼓勵之下，大家忙于將獻金封拆開，計算與登記。成績頗有可觀。最末，還舉行游藝助慶，盡歡而散。該會昨晚獻金成績就是這樣：港幣三百一十三元五角九分。國幣四十元五角，毫券九元四角，廣東毫幣八角一仙。即晚個別獻金最多者為：捷成洋行船務部仝人，共港銀九十元，韓金成君獨獻港銀十元。聞尚有一小部分獻金封尚未交齊，待明天才能截算總數呢，</p>

<p>本報特訊　香港專科夜學院是香港教育局主管的一個學府，共中漢文師範科是本港中小學漢文教師講習的學術集團，這個組織已有了二十幾年的歷史，為着絕少和外界交接，所以社會人士對他的觀念是那麼糢糊。他們自己覺得這個集團裏是其有相當大的力量，應該盡量的把它組織起來，貢献給社會，就有夜師同學會的組織。這個組織除了和一般普通同學會所具有目的外，還存着為社會教育服務的决心。——這個會成立迄今已是十個多月了。</p>
<p>昨天（廿六日）正午，他們假座加路連山孔聖堂舉行第三次聯歡會，意義是一方面聯絡同學間與學生間的感情；一面是誠懇的希望得外界人士的指導。在同學和教師合作下，隆重的舉行。到場的有該校主任羅仁伯及教師同學來賓五百餘人。</p>
<p>會場　陳設是簡單而肅穆，前門交懸着中英國旗，臺上張着深藍色的布幕，正中掛着黨國旗和總理像。一時開始行禮，雖然在滿懷着聯歡的喜氣，却為前方浴血的將士和被難的同胞遙寄莊嚴靜默的同情。該校主任維仁伯親臨指示，並詳述香港的特殊教育環境和香港教育工作者應有的認識，該校教師黃國方更對該會有着懇摯的勗勉。</p>
<p>為着聯歡不忘抗戰，同場舉行賣花，響應一元還債運動，即席核算，共得二十一元四角，並次定交本報轉匯呈政府。</p>
<p>游藝節目話劇有合鳴劇社主演的「火綫上」，旋風劇社的『逃亡者的怒吼』，和『死裏求生』；歌詠有生活合唱團的合唱，黃海志君獨唱的南海風雲，趙恩榮君父子的木琴獨奏和矮人歌舞，莊諧皆備，全場觀眾的情緒，也有相當的緊張。南海風雲一曲，是名導演蔡楚生先生編演中的南海風雲一片中的主題歌，盡量地表露出漁民的風韵與熱力，各話劇的演出，都有相當酌成就，尤以「死裏求生「一齣，最能把握住觀眾的心理與注意。</p>

<p>英皇書院的正門，早就點綴得璨斕如錦，聽說打扮這堂皇的門面費用，是由合興花生油廠負責的！會場內的其他佈置費用，亦由熱心人士分別負責的。萬物游藝籌募所得，通通涓滴歸公，用來救濟流離失所飢寒交迫的難民，三時未到，男男女女的來賓已粉紛抵步，真是鬧熱非常。招待來賓的男女職員，都忙個不了。</p>
<p>下午三時，舉行賣物游藝會開幕儀式，英皇書院的大堂，真是萬頭攅動，擠擁得水洩不通。首由主席雷蔭蓀致開會辭，繼由陸　雲報告籌備經過，葉蘭　致謝各商號捐助物品；最後，請　旭和爵士致辭。站得比較遠一些的人，恐　不會曉得台上人說的是什麽吧，不過，雖然聽不到，也總會猜到八九分的，他們說的無非是那些鼓勵我們觀眾多做點兒善事的話罷。</p>
<p>到下面游藝出賣物場剪綵開幕的時候，羅旭和爵士正想動手把綵繩剪斷，却想不到辦事人一時疏忽，忘記了剪綵是要用剪刀的，累了羅爵士眼巴巴地等了十多分鐘，才找得着剪刀。剪綵禮成，來賓便從樓上一擁而下，游藝場和賣物場，馬上就活動起來。</p>
<p>會場佈置，右為賣物場，左則為游藝場，再入則為茶水部，賣物場樓上，就是歌唱場，賣物場內，陳列各廠出品，種種式式，美麗奪目，真令觀者愛不忍釋，而且價目低康，都是依市價售出，所以購物極形踴躍。</p>
<p>游藝均節目多富有意義的玩意，如「打×奴」「打漢奸」等，尤令人捧腹大笑。其他如釣魚，旋輪奪彩，射擊等等，亦令人尋味。此外尚有飛球·擲飛機·飛針下架·打檯球·加數獎，試力獎，飛環銅扣，射生菓，飛仙入碟，五色球擲球，單車賽，青蝴入位，打大撙，膠槍氣球，最後勝利，航空救國，擲沙筒膠珠人穴等共廿西項，各項分列一游藝檯，全是游藝性質，以一亳之代價，便可獲得其價值　過代價數倍的品物，</p>
<p>首先光顧游藝場的，　羅文　律師，他「打漢奸」打了許多囘，終有一回竟然打中了「女漢奸」有功獲獎；可是羅律師並不是斤斤計較得着什麽獎品的，似乎祇是聊盡棉薄而已。我想，假使多一點不計較的熱心人士，游藝部份的收獲是會更好的。和「打漢奸」部份遙遙相對的，是「×××」，光顧這兩部份的人們，比其他各部份的來得多，足見民氣是怎樣的激昂，對漢奸和××是怎樣的想食其肉而寢其皮了。據一位「打漢奸」者說，這囘打漢奸，比幾年前</p>
<p>西湖岳王墳打秦檜夫妻的時侯，痛快得多。現在呢，西湖的遊春仕女，恐怕沒有，倒便宜了這漢奸鼻祖的秦檜了。會場標語也很刺目有力，即如「凡殖財　者，貴能施賑，否則財耳」，「外國人尚且援我難胞，我國人應當如何？」這樣的標語，我相信儘有許多人看了會不高興　或許會慚愧無地的！</p>
<p>會期還有兩天，謹在這兒替無量數的遭難同胞請命，僑胞們請你大解善義，到　包含娛樂與救濟兩重意義的場合裏，充份給這些難胞們以力所能玫的援手吧！來吧！這個慈善賣物游藝會是會令你滿意的。（新）</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者白韋</p>
<p>去年十月九日×軍自惠博撤退以後、東江的軍事經過了一個稍長時間的沉寂、事實上固由於×人深感到兵力的不敷、不得不將防綫緊縮、同時也由於我們反攻恣態的雄壯、民衆游擊隊伍的威脅、上可以控制潮梅、下可以防衛廣州、側可以貫通大亞　的海岸，就地理的形勢而論、惠州——包括惠博河紫海陸等縣——仍不失其相當重要的軍事評價的、所以×人這次的走、非心的所甘、而是力的不逮，</p>
<p>因了這樣、×人自然沒有放棄佔據的企圖，不過爲着節省兵力、改換了不同的形式、去月底×人所主持的陸豐暴動、便是改換軍事、採取政治、不同形式的一種、到了本年二月、覺得民氣激　的東江、政治的陰謀完全失去效果、才把軍事的攻略再改成軍事的騷擾、初旬的聯和墟之役、現在的却有龍華，長寧諸役、其實×人這種軍事的騷擾、不僅是勞而無功、而且反給我們完成了消耗、吸引的戰策，尤其是更給我們武裝的農民多一個表現身手的機會、</p>
<p>關干聯和、龍華、畏寧諸役的戰績、記者適於今天下午會見了代表博羅縣府來惠報吿的秘書　劍雄君、更綜合着從東江別働隊司令部得來的情報、頗詳其中的經過的，</p>
<p>×人迭次騷擾的動機、均含有煙幕的作用、第一擾亂我們的視綫、牽制東江我軍的兵力、第二以攻爲守、防止我們的進攻、所以當聯和墟進犯的時候、還有一二艘×　出現於大亞灣、一二架×機出現於東江的天空、迄未登陸投彈、証明是配合着的整個計劃、至於這次龍華、長寧的竄入、大部似是掩護和策應海南島的進攻、其次才是聯和損失的報復手段、據蕭秘書的報吿、聯和圩之役、我們死傷民衆六名、敵人却被　斃五十二名、（駐石灣的四十三名、石龍的五名、增城的四名）、在×人的心裏是多麼巨大的差慣、</p>
<p>鑒於聯和的敎訓、×入這次進犯的隊伍、衆達三千餘人、分兩路推進、八日下午一路步砲兵千餘、騎兵三百餘、從石龍經　蘭、馬嘶小路而來、目的地爲龍華一帶、一路步砲馬隊共二千餘、飛機多架、從增城而來、目的地爲　浮山麓、</p>
<p>九日的黎明、石龍之×已越過了白角鄉、抵達龍華、駐龍華的別働隊卜志揚部率同了武裝的鄉民奮起抵抗、雖然掩護前進的×機不斷的轟炸、×人的山砲不斷的轟擊、他們迄不退去憑籍着墟內房屋遮蔽、向着×人掃射、直至墟裏外圍的房屋擊毀將盡、才退入附近的山崗、退入山崗以後、還隱藏在樹林申、用他們的毛瑟土槍、向×人繼續迎擊、這英勇的姿態是不可多覩的、所以×人攻入了龍華、肆意縱火焚燒洩憤、不敢久留、下午一時回駐　範、十日下午退同石龍、沿途所經的村鄕、上村、鶴藪、下村、×人隨走隨　、我們武裝的農民也隨遇隨擊、由於農民們的奮不顧身、雖然我們的犧牲頗大、傷亡將近百名、意想×人遭我們的不斷截擊、數目相差亦在不遠了，一枝土槍、一把大刀、戰勝了×人的飛機大砲、英勇的農民、別働隊員是久永値得謳歌的、想不到這小小的墟鎭、竟戢沒了×人的兇燄、</p>
<p>增城之×、同時大舉來襲、通過了博羅的四區福田、長寧、東平等墟、奔竄至羅浮山、事先別働隊林　生部已作正面的迎抗、發生了　烈的白刃搏戰、終感覺　寡的懸殊、才率隊轉進羅浮山間和瀾水、施行游擊的側襲。當×人沿羅浮山公路行進間、我們從白鶴觀的山上、（排排的輕機槍彈、如連珠地掃下、已經可知道有多少×人染血在那條公路的路上、及×人大隊追來、我們又攀過別一個山頭、同樣的掃下、又看見×人一個個一樣的仆倒、羅浮山眞配說是×人的墳墓了、可惜×入對擊斃了的屍體、皆拚命的掩護運回、不然、不僅公路上染上血跡、還放着現成的紀念品、林俊生隊長剛於昨天到惠報吿、記者從他報吿的語調中、是多麼領略到他在這次作戰中的內心愉快和興奮、由於損失的奇慘、×人把隊伍仲展到了瀾石、不敢再事留戀和延長、十日下午立刻逃回增城去、</p>
<p>如果×人要計算此次作戰的所獲、恐怕祗有一項——焚了我們的村莊、焚燒、本是×人的拿手把戲、自馬嘶以至龍華、自福田以至瀾石、雖未據詳細的調查、估計全數被焚總在二千家左右、然而、他把火焚燒農民的家、何殊把火放在農民們的心上、看我們英勇强悍的農民、替他們的家和×人算這盤火賬、同時我們却要廣大的發起慰勞及救濟運動、賑救這批無家無依的戰友、</p>
<p>現在×人的陰謀顯然失敗了、×人的隊伍退至增城和石龍、我們的隊伍、包舍着武裝民衆、却隨着挺淮至增城、緊緊的糾編着、展開多方面的襲擊、東江游擊隊充分執行「×來我抗、×退我擾』的游擊基本戰術、使×人沒有一點喘息和主動的可能、這樣將使東江的×人、困苦羸弱而滅亡、</p>

<p>— 華游</p>
<p>玉環拿過手、我心裏感到有點愉快、原壁歸趙、正要跨步回去的時候、那狐假虎威者却對張君說道、「我眞有點對他不高興、」說時把眼睛向我一睢、張君問他爲什麽時、他說我不該小題大做、這裏有潮洲、福建、海南、客家各種人的「媽臻」、我不願意送他時、儘管可以聲明、何必動不動就往領事館報吿呢、我對張君說、假如我不這樣做、老虎嘴裏總要不出肉來呵。</p>
<p>回到旅館之後、永安老板　其他的旅客、大家都十分高興起來、他們說我此遭交涉的勝利、實是破題兒第一遭、蓋一般僑胞來此地、給他們不知拿去多少東西、從來就沒有人會向他們辦交涉的、</p>
<p>據說從前西貢海關人員拿東西、並不像現在這樣甚、所以促成法蘭西人如此肆無忌憚的原因是這樣的、</p>
<p>A媽臻溺職——七府衣箱亭裏所　用的「媽臻」、並不能稱職、華僑有什麼困難的問題、他們都置若罔聞，他不但不帮你的忙、有時部和那些關員狼狽爲奸、魚肉僑胞、最近駐西貢領事館擬派員到衣箱亭　帮助僑胞的事宜、不知是否已　行、我想領事館能够實行上面的計劃、那對於僑胞的裨益、豈是數目字所能統計得來、蓋領館如果能派員前往監督、那些關員自然不敢任意拿我僑胞的東西、有什麽困難的問題、也可當面請他交涉、其實到那時候，我相信就不會有什麽事可以起交涉的、因爲我們旣然有了官員在那裏監督、相信他們也會相當客氣的、蓋目前中法的邦交正是十分親善呀、</p>
<p>B缺乏團體組織——一般華僑最大的缺陷就是自私心太大、他們到南洋去、只求如何能够賺得錢、只要有錢可賺、什麼氣都可以忍受的、人家捉住你的　點、自然任意爲所欲爲、據一般華　的估量、每一次輪船靠了西貢岸、華僑蒙受的損失、總以千計、這樣累年積月、眞是一筆巨大的款　、我的意思、七府的當事人、應當設法補這漏巵、最簡單的方法、就是多請幾位常年法律顧問、如遇到那些關員任意搶掠一般僑胞的東西、則當據理駁斥、蓋我僑之行李、該納稅的他們盡管照章辦理、絕無理由强奪人家之東西佔爲己有也、</p>
<p>C怕事——當作者索囘玉環之後、卓副領事嘗向當地稅務司抗議、據該稅務司的意見、只要能够搜集出證據來、他們一定嚴厲取締的、因此卓副領事就託我代爲搜集一些證據、只是五個證據、竟是費了不少力氣才能繳卷、他們都「諱莫如深」地隱藏起來、他們恐怕一出面、將來如果需要到法庭作證時、對他們的居留怕會發生什麼問題來、總而言之、一般華僑的敎育程度太可憐了、他們對于一切的事件、多不能辦別他的是非來、就是明白了是非、却又缺乏力量去做、這樣只好聽取人家的宰割吧了</p>
<p>一般華僑的弱點、所蒙釗的損失、已如上面所說、要補救這種損失、並不是不可能、以我的管見、只要駐西貢領館諸執事、利用目前中法邦交親善、再進而根據前年（？）在南京簽訂中越商約那種平等互惠的原則、要求法殖民地政府改善待遇，相信可以辦得通的、</p>
<p>A對于上岸時不能隨身携帶行李的意見、一般僑胞前往西貢、感到最痛苦的就是沒被蓋、沒衣服更換、安南雖然位于熱帶、但是一遇到雨季……陰曆、六七八等月爲安南雨量最多的時候、氣候是够凉快的、一到夜裏更非蓋上洋　不可、我們于上岸時、隨身帶　條洋氈他們也不允許、這樣到了客棧只好讓那凉冷的寒氣欺凌吧了、（客棧和旅館的性質不同、旅館是具有被褥、客棧則什麽都沒有、除了舖床及木枕之外）、沒被蓋自是受罪、沒衣服更換、也够受罪、何况由汕頭下船之後、就沒有洗過澡—、太平洋第三隻輪船、除官艙設備有浴房之外、大艙是沒有的、這樣只能够忍耐到岸後才說、上了岸又苦着沒衣服更換、這差不多是每個華僑都認爲最苦不過的事、因此在輪船進了西貞港時、大家都多穿一兩件衣服、（間也有穿至六七件者、這是一般沒有意識的婦女想要避免納稅、結局反是當場露醜——給海關的檢查員晚下來）以備上岸更換、法國的關員竟認爲是想逃稅、我嘗親眼看見幾位橋胞穿着兩件笠衫（紗衣給他們脫下一件去納稅的、甚至只穿一件新的紗衣、也給他們剝下來納稅【未完】</p>

<h3 id="c61">昨天足球義賽　港聯軍廹和南華　一比一全局演出輕描淡寫 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天加山那幕足球義賽、全局都有輕描淡寫的演出、若說爲精彩、間中又覺平凡、若謂爲鬆弛、或時有點緊張、總之、雙方球人此次相會、乃爲災黎請命、全無錦標問題存乎其間，故而表演成份多於競勝心理，各人一舉一動、都以技術爲前提、戰情尙覺悅目可觀、一般球迷亦不算枉此一行、而且解囊爲善、無愧於心、夜來定然穩　、</p>
<p>午前細雨如毛、天氣沉悶、午後朋放　、不致有誤球場好事、兩路大軍、依時出動、看客亦有三四千衆、塲面尙見熱鬧、惟李惠堂在本屆每次參加義賽、則以此回觀者略減、查　原因、似有下列三點影嚮、（一）邇來賽會過多、迷民多看則厭、此是必然之理、（二）自埠際試賽以迄正式賽、惠堂數次登塲献技、與迷民連結球緣、不像以前于呼萬喚始出來、故而一般的渴望、由於頻見具人、已變爲平凡的印象、（三）昨天上午下雨、適足壓低球迷們一團高　、</p>
<p>是役雙方都未以所選定的原班人馬上陣、南華方面、譚振輝替劉偉培、羅斗交代劉松生、然而整個的實力、亳無减弱、港聯方面、吿山奴踪跡渺然、座上迷民、到時見他不出、即具有輕視港聯前線不濟於事的心理、代他担任中鋒職的是磨　、梳氏也倦勤、故用後備禮地土打左鋒、又用榜上無名而臨將被邀効力的譚馬士打左翼、因此、在戰事開始時、無論誰都以爲南華定會大勝特勝的，蓋單以兩方的前綫來比　、南華五虎何等威猛、港聯守將雖不被嚇走、也會被打走、給他們威脅之下、焉能支持得來呢、但、人家雖作如是想、而經七十分鐘競爭的結果、竟一比一戰成和局、而且南華所勝一球、顯然惠堂先巳越位、惟因裁判員看不清楚、　給予惠堂一個例外的收獲、故局面雖和、事實上南華是敗的、</p>
<p>此賽是　演性質、對於勝負問題、毋庸側重批評、若以實力論、南華確較充沛、亦常佔優勢、惟終不能因此而開闢其致勝的途徑、所獲的僅一意外而又是越位之球、似此、南華前綫不振抑是港聯防衛堅牢呢、依我看來、惠堂被比路度亦步亦趨的釘着不得活動是最大原因，比路基本來一個頂好盤球出擊的正前衛、但他昨天竟然改變作風、實行採用第三內衛法、緾着惠堂寸步不離、有時還加上侯容生或施漢的帮助、合數人之力來阻惠堂、所以惠堂的中央　擊，在此役無從施展出來、全局中、他得球射門的機會、上半時祇有兩次、又因是義賽、他不斤斤於勝利是求、亦不變更戰略、（日前華聯對菲隊一役、他採用　後戰略、引誘對方中堅遠出、而由兩輔側擊、卒收奇功）、此已顯見他的隨便、孫來麥紹漢與譚馬　相撞負傷退出、他卽由前軍退作後軍、補承紹漢之缺、改攻爲守、一般球迷見狀、都引爲談枘、據我所知、多年前上海樂華隊南遊過港、曾作表　賽、那時惠堂尙在樂華軍中、出任內衛、演出很好、但返港後從未再彈此調、昨戰他偶爾反串、頗覺生梗、然具知機進退、確非老於戎行的不克此、</p>
<p>有入謂此役是自有義賽以來、最不够刺激的一次、惟値得一評的、厥爲兩位門員之大演身手、張榮材技確不凡、每于危急間或仆或躍、救球出險，對于避衝及撲球諸術、敏捷穩健、開「球門球」又以必交本隊球員爲目的、比之普通門員之盲目踢出便算了事者、實勝多多、此點對于進攻方面、大有補助、劾利則仍然以扭腰飛撲見著、所以兆榮幾次急射、皆吿無效、他又身高手長、不畏衝刺、至所失一球、在他當然認爲理不應該的、</p>
<p>港聯前線各員演出不錯、磨士打中鋒、够兇、够脚頭力、南華被他威脅不少、兩翼也間見隹作、守衛方面、因比路度力纏惠堂、不敢出擊、乃得以允實防禦力量、卒保不敗、我認爲港聯能够不致多失、比路度應居第一功、</p>
<p>華南各員因側重技術的演出、一傳一交、盤一運、都恰到好　，但因傳交盤運過多、　常在中場角逐、而成互相爭奪的局面、</p>
<p>談過球經、再述戰情、戰時兩軍排陣如下、</p>
<p>【南華會】</p>
<p>張榮材</p>
<p>李天生　麥紹漢</p>
<p>譚振輝　梁榮照　劉慶材</p>
<p>羅斗文　黎兆榮　李惠堂　馮景祥　鄧廣森</p>
<p>【港聯隊】</p>
<p>劾利</p>
<p>施漢　侯榕生</p>
<p>許　成　比路度　　尼波路</p>
<p>譚馬士　禮地士　磨士　　尼　奄巴臣</p>
<p>時屆、戰神駕臨、兩軍開始火併、惠堂一馬當先、兆榮景祥分兵助攻、港聯前衛見狀，三路迎擊、戰了幾個回合、惠堂等引軍而退、奄巴臣偷過防線、把球切中、　士當中發炮、榮才挺身出救、很妙、</p>
<p>斗文兆榮合路興師、韓尼波路力阻、再進不得、那邊廂譚馬士邊關起義、切中恰好、磨士奔前命射、榮才仆地援救、又是一次佳作、港聯雖得角球、無利而退、榮照振輝　材三傑、掩護前軍、向前推　、果見惠堂破關而入、斗文相應、逼得角球、底綫開來、　榮猛射、劾利挽救得力、化險爲夷、</p>
<p>體地士偷入重圍、猛施冷箭、磨士相繼發炮、來勢殊勁、差幸榮才眼　手快、　遭暗算、跟着禮地士再次來犯、天生從容救出、斗天卽揮軍推進、越入容生陣地舉足猛射、適中劾利身上、功敗垂成、可惜之至、然而南華終不因此自餒、榮照送親、惠堂奔前問鼎、炮彈一發、惜落野外、　榮捲土重來、港聯守將見其來勢汹汹、嚴陣以特、兆榮毫身殺入重圍、疾射球門，適中門柱、反彈而出、廣森策馬趕來、加上一脚、又不中的、失去良機、</p>
<p>港聯危機已過、奄巴臣銳意反攻、惟射門欠準、無濟于事、景祥右路進兵、斗文從旁嚮應、得球猛射、又被劾利拒出界外、廣森開來角球、依然未收漁利、巳而惠堂斗文景祥兆榮聯軍衝進、勢如排山倒海、劾利挺前力撰、施漢容生齊出抵抗、得以挽回危局、上半時打成平手、</p>
<p>易地再戰、南華一鼓作氣、廣森迫近港聯陣地、遇着施漢竭力糾纏、終被殺退、比路度竟成掩護前軍、搶入南華要地、磨士衝前策應、幸榮才鎭定從事、化干戈爲玉帛、</p>
<p>惠堂中路進展、得廣森傳來、拾足用頭、一頂出界、看來頗不錯的樣子、移時、斗天又將球傳交惠堂、越過韓尼波路、容主不知來勢、劾利止欲迎救、而惠堂早已脚頭起處、球兒應聲人網、劾利惟有望球興嘆、惠堂在先原巳越位、惟裁判員看不淸楚、遂有此意外之獲得</p>
<p>港聯先吿失利、銳意反攻、譚馬士迫得角　、惟無建樹、廣森再度興兵、劾利出門截；斗文赶來接　，惟操之過急、射出界外、</p>
<p>有頃、兆漢勇戰受傷、退出塲外、僅以十人應戰、惠堂恐怕後方有失、乃退作後軍、把守內衛、不料被譚馬士潜度函關、切球門前、禮地士拼命衝刺、舉足扣門、榮才拍球出外、　被毫巴臣截得、輕輕傳囘、葛尼趕至、一蹴卽入、平反敗局、此後雙方均有進展、惟均爲再勝機會、完場時以一比一、平分春色、收軍下山、</p>

<h3 id="c66">如此人師 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>近幾天我們這兒的報紙曾登載了兩段這樣的新聞：</p>
<p>前省立女子中學校長××交代不淸楚。其經手集募的學校捐款竟一點沒交代，經現校長　間之後，又在報　含糊其詞，致惹起地方公論的不滿。</p>
<p>前縣立中學校長楊××交代時僅移交新校長國幣二元；經新校畏澈奮之下，始知前　極爲　塗，且學生保証金及學生會寄存之救關捐欵數百元亦全無交代，一時該　學生聞訊大譚。</p>
<p>這兩段新聞都是一類的：含糊點說是「交代不淸」，明白點說就是「侵吞公欵」。</p>
<p>這兩段新聞的主角也同樣是神聖的中學校長。</p>
<p>這就使我不能不要來一點「有　於中』了。</p>
<p>中等學校教育的目的，是下列兩項幷重的：</p>
<p>a，各種基本智識的奠定，</p>
<p>b，靑年品格的　養。</p>
<p>忽略了a固然不行，忽略了b尤其不行，這道理自然是坎明白不過的了。賽如說，我們常說：靑年人好比一匹潔白的布料，丟到紅色染缸　就變成了紅，丟到黑色染缸裏就變成了黑。這就是說，靑年人是沒有主意的。意志薄弱的，假如不好好的導引他　上康莊大路，他就要莽莽聞闖的掉到陷阱裏去的。同時，我們都知道，靑年是民埃國家最珍貴的活力，如果不當着待候把他們陶養成爲良好的公民那對於民族國家的損失簡直是無以補　的。中學敎育恰恰就主要地担下了這陶餐靑年品格的大任。一匹白布的變成紅色或是黑色，中學教育實在就是投布落缸的人。這樣，我們就明白中學敎育對于民族國家的重要了。尤其當着這個民族艱苦鬭爭的時代，由於我們的鬭爭是不能限期的，是一步艱難一步的，因此，民族國家對於靑年的倚重自是不必冉加說明的了，也就是說，靑年品格的陶養是要比以前更加値得注意的了。何况，這又是一個劃時代的時代，我們决不能再幾我們的靑年依舊走上那以前腐朽的道路了，我們要導引我們的靑年走上新的光明的大路。</p>
<p>但就在這樣一個嚴重的時期，我們却仍然看到了這樣的兩校中學校長，而且，我們也知道，不論在軍政敎育各界，一直到今天，像這两位棱長一樣的人，仍然是多到不可　數的。於是，我眞有點不忍設想了。</p>
<p>不過，如今正是個戰鬥的時代，一切都在戰鬥，在充滿了戰　情緒的氛園裏，决不容許我們冉消極了的，爲了民族，爲了國家，爲了拯救千千萬萬面臨深淵的靑年人！我們冉也不能容忍了，我們應當立即伸出我們的拳領來，來一個激烈的戰鬬，把我們的周圍像那兩位校畏一樣的人物賜除開去——那是當前亟待做而且亟待做到的工作。　——在嶺東、</p>
<h3 id="c67">「不知肉味」及其他 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>最近報上登過一則「不知肉味」的新聞，約略的提到侵略者老家經濟恐慌的一般情形，聲如掘金潮興隆興肉價高漲等等，這些都是「不知肉味」的外界因素，照我的意思則還是從心理觀點上去給我們高鄰們底「不知肉味」作註脚來得　合些。</p>
<p>從許多年前準戰時社會機構步入眞正戰時狀態以來，高鄰們的苦是早吃够了（這自然是指亨受不到戰爭利潤的一羣人而言），不過以前總稱還能敷衍一個門面，媽姐虎虎過去，現在可就不行了，丈夫兒子裏着千人針死在異域，家中店舖收歇的收歇，不收歇的也眼看要破產了，非軍需工業的不景氣連帶敲碎了自己作工的飯碗，此外還得再加上猛于虎的苛政，和隨時可被派任的慰安工作……「源」斷「流」不節，整年整月磨碎了未亡人的心，心思　了，什麼事部沒有勁幹，「心不在焉，食而不知其味」，所以也就一不知肉味」了，不用說肉吃不到，郎使能吃到了，亦是和着眼淚吞下去的，那裏　道是甜，酸，苦，辣，抑或是　的呢？</p>
<p>「不知肉味」是侵略者老家的悲哀，至于百萬以上的「征人」，那倒是「不知　味」的人多一些：「鹽」這个字見不單是指細白的食鹽，廣義的說，海中含　，大洋中也含鹽，凡是生活中所不能缺少的東西都含有些抽象的　味——家庭，故鄉，夫妻，自由與和平　，「征人」在異域聞的是火藥味，看的是孤　的平原和茫然的山涯，單調的叱嘯聲與單調的無靈魂的工作，胸中沒有目的，沒有自由的意志，望不到富士山麓下的碧海，賞不到一星兒的鹽味，有時被圍困在絕地中，那更是名符其實的一不知　味』了，這種人的悲哀完全被馬鞭子壓了下去，不過，單就零碎可知的事件而言，也就不輸于「不知肉味」的人們了。</p>
<p>『肉」是健康的滋養料，『鹽』是身心的活力素，長年「不知肉味」和一不知監味一的結果如何，是不雞想像的，今日的雙重悲哀不難成爲將來雙重的打擊，祇知『弄堂行軍」的人們專想武運的長存，却忘記了比『武運一更重要得多的事情，是他們瘋了嗎？是他們傻了麼？不，至少不十分是，最大的原因是他們自己一個階層的人知道　味和肉味，就想不到那些『不知肉味』與『不知鹽味』的人們底苦楚，自然也就避免不了不久的將來這二重悲哀所聯繫起來的哀吼！</p>

<h3 id="c69">目前通俗文藝的缺點 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 拉特</p>
<p>目前通俗文藝的口號再提出，證明了文藝作者的新覺悟，已在抗戰之後普遍起來了，同時通俗文藝的理論也已有相當的充實和鞏固了，雖然今天還沒有通俗文　的大　作品，從速產生，推廣到民間去，但我們在事實上考，起來，則不能不承認通俗文藝的作品已在向前競爭推進，必能開出一朶鮮艷的文藝之花，造出民族抗戰的優秀藝術。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能够　着眼睛來過高的估計通俗文藝作品在目前的優點。我們還應該檢討它的缺點在目前是否相當的嚴重。這是我們首先要指出，而希望有以克服的。</p>
<p>目前通俗文藝在創作上究竟有什麼缺點呢？在一般地說來，有如下的兩點：</p>
<p>第一，舊形式無條件的利用：爲着要利用大衆所愛好着的形式，而注入抗戰建國的內容，作爲宣傳的工具，這不能說是不對。可是有不少文藝作者，往往對於舊形式不經過消毒即加以而灌注的內客，結果造成形式與內容不能健全的配合，無形中使鑄下了一篇作品對大衆的感應力的消失。比如說，以桃色小調，裝進宣傳×軍的殘暴，以封建範疇的大戲，裝進民族英雄的戰鬭史實。這一定不能得到有力的表現，發生有效的感應作用。可惜有些文藝作者便犯着了這一毛病，舊瓶裝新酒自然是可以的，但舊瓶假如能够洗刷過一回，消毒過一回來裝着的，則新酒必然顯出它更好的味素，因此，加强對舊形式的愼審的選擇，是不可不注意的事了。</p>
<p>第二：失了抗戰建國內容的多樣性。許多文藝作家，雖然已能够在舊形式中灌進了抗戰建國的內容，可是這種內容是非常單調乏味，他們一篇一篇的都是血肉長城的歌頌，大砲衝鋒的歌　，很少看到抗戰建國的烽火中每個角落裏Ａ民大衆整個生活的反　，更很少看到×軍方面士兵的厭戰反戰情緒具體地描述。這　軍事唯一主義者的通俗文藝，初讀起來固然能令人一時興奮，但得讀下去就有些令人厭倦起來了。這又是指示着，舊形式新內容所謂通俗文藝，假如不是從多樣性的各個場面去攝取他的題材，必然會使通俗文藝前途停滯在非常狹隘的　子裏了，這又是不可不顧慮的。</p>
<p>上面兩點，我覺得是今天的通俗交藝所普遍犯　毛病。爲着嬰補救通俗文藝運動的缺點，我們憑把握現實，有另起爐灶的必要了。</p>

<p>雖然存心不是躱在後方「緊吃」，有時却也不免被友人「拉」上茶樓。</p>
<p>茶樓上可眞熱鬧極了，座無虛設之外，還有許多站着等『吃』的人們，幾個伙計穿梭似的輪流轉「大飽』『燒賣」喊個不停，擦鞋的孩子，賣藥的先生，賣化裝品以至香烟之類的推銷員，忽忙地向每一個『緊吃』的先的們　接生意，</p>

<p>當我和朋友找得一角落的座位坐下不久，忽　有一個衣衫相當襤褸的斯文人，閃縮而又像很謙恭似的雙手遞來一張小紙片，放在桌上便走開了。我心裏想，這上面大概是什麽求助的訴詞吧。可是我底友拿過這紙片來望一眼便遞給我，說：「猜來猜去不外這些字吧了。」我接過一看，原來是猜謎語的，上面整齊地寫上四句：</p>

<p>我想了想了問我底友：『這不是纓字嗎？』『對啦！」朋友點點頭，同時在煙包背面寫上一個『櫻』字。</p>
<p>不一會，那位猜字先生送謎底來了，賠着笑臉，雙手打拱作揖地，態度比剛才愈發謙恭了，他看見桌上煙包已經寫上了『纓』字，便很逢迎地說：「嘻嘻，先生已經猜中了，嘻喀，……」。先生賞個　。嘻嘻……」。雙手不斷地打拱。我底朋友在袋裏掏了一個銅板給他，說：「這些都猜得爛熟了，沒什意思』。</p>
<p>這位猜字先生接過銅板，連聲說『謝謝，謝謝』，再從手裏一疊紙片中抽出一張來放在桌上，他又跑到別個座位找主顧去了。我拿過來看，這次，的可不是投合低級趣味，而帶有濃厚的政治諷刺性，因此特地將它抄了下來：</p>

<h3 id="e1">Two Grave Problems Confronting the Nation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the development of the international situation, two points are particularly worth noting: one is the abrupt turn for the worse in the Spanish war situation, and the other is Japan's insane recklessness in the Far East. Both reveal the new offensive of the Fascist aggression front and the tendency for the world war crisis to expand prematurely. To what extent this situation will evolve and what impact it will have on China and the world depends entirely on the attitude of the democratic and peaceful front, especially the United Kingdom and France, before a relatively definitive judgment can be obtained. Therefore, we have a serious question today: Under this situation, where will the rulers of the United Kingdom and France go?</p>
<p>The Spanish war was originally a war in which the Spanish democratic republican government was suppressing the Fascist rebel army led by Franco. This war by the Spanish government gained the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of the country's people who advocated democracy, loved freedom, and equality domestically, and it also received the sympathy and assistance of people from all over the world who cherished democracy and peace internationally. Conversely, the Fascist rebel army led by Franco was driven by the aggressors of Italy and Germany and violated the public opinion of the entire nation internally, so it originally had no chance of winning by luck. However, because of the compromising policies of the democratic and peaceful countries, especially the rulers of the United Kingdom and France, under the slogan of "non-interventionism," on the one hand, they prevented the Spanish government from purchasing ammunition and military supplies from the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union according to law. On the other hand, they condoned Germany and Italy's continuous dispatch of naval, land, and air forces and all kinds of military fire and military supplies to assist the Spanish rebel army in combat. Finally, there was the recent fall of Catalonia, which caused the Spanish legitimate government's war of resistance to encounter an unprecedented crisis. However, if the rulers of the United Kingdom and France could realize the danger of condoning the aggressors at this time, resolutely abandon the compromising policy, and use force to assist the Spanish government in sanctioning the rebel army and its commanders, the authorities of Italy and Germany, then, given the fact that Italy and Germany were outwardly strong but inwardly weak, not only could the Spanish situation turn from danger to safety, but the European situation would also have the hope of turning to stability. Unexpectedly, the rulers of the United Kingdom and France valued their own class interests more than the interests of the country and the world, and finally adopted a policy of further compromise with the aggressors of Italy and Germany, superficially attempting to suppress the Spanish government, end the Spanish war, and achieve temporary peace by recognizing the Spanish rebel army and its regime. Unfortunately, the result of this policy is not only directly sacrificing Spain, but also after Italy and Germany win in Spain, their feathers will become more prosperous, their arrogance will become higher, the European situation will become more and more dangerous, and the crisis of the great war cannot but become more urgent and expanded!</p>
<p>Japan's aggressors have recently expanded their recklessness in the Far East, such as forcibly occupying Hainan Island, bombing Luohu in the New Territories of Hong Kong, and robbing the concessions in Shanghai. The reason why they have advanced their launch at this time is that the intensified implementation of the compromising policy of the rulers of the United Kingdom and France on the Spanish issue is the most important motive! Japan's reckless actions in the Far East are, on the one hand, the prelude to the new strategy implemented by the Italian and German aggressors in Europe, and on the other hand, the alarm of the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific." The purpose of the first step is to  force the authorities of the United Kingdom and France to abandon their aid to China policy and force our country to stop resisting Japan. The second step is the unfolding of the "Pacific Hegemony War," and those threatened will not be limited to Hong Kong, Singapore, Annam, Burma, and the Philippines, which is an inevitable trend. All hopes of surviving under the iron fist of Fascist aggressors will be shattered without a trace by bloody tears. How to prevent this crisis, on the one hand, depends on the heroic perseverance of the Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan, and on the other hand, it still depends on the mutual unity and cooperation of peaceful and democratic countries, especially the rulers of the United Kingdom and France, abandoning any compromising policies, actively promoting the democratic and peaceful front, and sanctioning Fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>According to recent intelligence, the United Kingdom and France have paid close attention to the new recklessness of the aggressors in the Far East, believing that the situation is very serious. Japanese newspapers also published a message from Germany on the 25th of this month, stating that the United Kingdom has completed its Pacific defense plan, and that Singapore, Darwin, and New Guinea have been connected to form a line of resistance against attacks. According to a Reuters report on the 26th of this month, the British government will transfer British-Indian troops and heavy artillery from Singapore to Penang Island, a transportation hub between Europe and Asia in the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca, next Wednesday. On the same day, a Hanoi telegram relayed news to Paris, stating that French military technical experts have already drafted various plans on how to defend Annam. Mr. Bosquet, vice chairman of the French House of Representatives Naval Committee, recently, in view of the possibility that Japan may jointly attack Annam with Siam, also strongly urged France to strengthen the defense of French Annam. These news are generally reliable, which shows the positive attitude of the rulers of the United Kingdom and France towards the Far East. However, we must recognize that the recklessness of the three major aggressors, Japan, Germany, and Italy, is different in terms of geographical area, namely Europe, Africa, and East Asia, but in fact, they all aim to realize their new demands by coercing the rulers of the United Kingdom and France. Therefore, the rulers of the United Kingdom and France will never be able to compromise in Europe and win strongly in the Far East alone. Therefore, we certainly hope that the United Kingdom and France can quickly take a strong policy of resisting aggression in the Far East and actively strengthen the military defense forces in the Far East, so that the reckless blackmail conspiracy of the Japanese aggressors, who are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and full of crises, will completely fail. But we hope even more that the people of the United Kingdom and France will urge their governments to quickly abandon the compromising policies that harm the country and the world, and comprehensively implement the actions of united democratic and peaceful countries to resist Fascist aggression. Because only in this way can the position and prestige of the United Kingdom and France in Europe and the Far East be guaranteed, and only in this way can the crisis of world war be thoroughly reduced and eliminated, and the reasonable resolution of the difficulties of various countries and the reasonable development of the interests of various countries be promoted.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The New Appearance of Changsha <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Following the fall of Guangzhou, the retreat from Wuhan, and the great fire in Changsha, which once drew immense attention and infinite sympathy from the world, only a few months have passed. However, the local authorities and people of the province, adhering to the government's policy of "resistance on one hand, and national reconstruction on the other," are actively engaged in relief work and promoting reconstruction plans. It seems that Changsha, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, will soon display its new appearance amidst the great torrent of the national reconstruction effort.</p>
<p>The reporter returned from Miluo to Changsha, getting off the train at around four o'clock in the morning. A porter led the way to find a hotel, walking through several unnamed streets and alleys. Although the roads had been cleaned up very neatly and one could walk normally, the east was not yet bright, and it was drizzling. Looking at the dilapidated walls on both sides that had not burned down, they seemed to sway precariously, as if about to collapse head-on. The kerosene lamps hanging on the police booths in the middle of the road emitted a dim and eerie light. Occasionally, stepping heavily, one would elicit echoes like those in an empty valley. Faced with this desolate and gloomy environment, hearing these particularly mournful sounds, a feeling of loneliness and darkness that breeds unease couldn't help but frequently assail the heart.</p>
<p>After a while, a large group of people came towards us. The sound of hooves clattering, and the shadows of people looming, seemed to be about a battalion in strength, walking past us on the right, one file after another. The head of the column was indeed rushing silently with a gag in their mouths, not uttering a word, until at the end of the column, a commanding officer with a Northeastern accent scolded a soldier: "What are you doing with your hands behind your back!" What a "What are you doing with your hands behind your back!" This not only allows one to imagine how strict the military discipline of this unit usually is, but also seemed to strike a loud morning bell in the surrounding quiet and dark air!</p>
<p>Indeed, the morning bell really rang, and the sky gradually brightened. It turned out that after the darkness, there was indeed "light"!</p>
<p>After placing the luggage in a hotel across from the Finance Department on Zhongshan Road, bathed in the morning light filtering through the thin clouds, and with a conflicting feeling of wanting to see but being unable to bear it, I went to inspect the disaster areas. In fact, the disaster area was right outside the door; moreover, it was burned as the saying goes, "Changsha is one piece," not knowing which area to go to first. Later, I decided: Since I'm walking aimlessly, I might as well just walk and see what happens.</p>
<p>Now that I have walked and seen, because the disaster area is particularly large and the disaster situation is extremely serious, it would be difficult to describe it in detail. Therefore, I can only use a summary method to briefly explain it:</p>
<p>The central urban area, except for the Finance Department, the theater, and twenty or thirty houses near the National Products Exhibition Hall on East Zhongshan Road that were still spared, the houses in major streets and alleys such as Zoumalou, Huangcang Street, and Yaowang Street have all been completely burned to the ground. The devastation is comparable to the Zhabei and Nanshi districts destroyed by fire during the August 13th Shanghai battle, and the Guilin disaster area that has been bombed and burned by enemy aircraft many times. The western part, such as Taiping Street, Daxi Gate, and Xiaoxi Gate, has also become a field of rubble. In the south, except for a part of Bixiang Street, Liangchangping, and Huilong Mountain, the rest have all been reduced to ashes. In addition, there are many areas that have not been inspected, but eight or nine out of ten are also razed to the ground. In short, the ancient capital of the Chu Kingdom for thousands of years has been reduced to a de facto scorched earth!</p>
<p>Government agencies: the Finance and Education Departments were unscathed, the Civil Affairs Department still had a part left, while the Provincial Government, Telegraph Bureau, Telephone Bureau, etc., all perished together. Public places: the National Products Exhibition Hall, with its magnificent architecture and a variety of goods, and the Tianxin Pavilion, with its towering buildings and beautiful scenery, except for the National Products Exhibition Hall retaining some reinforced concrete remains to勉供 a few refugees to live in, all the rest of the scenery was buried by the ruthless fire. Spinning mills, electricity companies, and some foreign properties, and 民居望衡對宇 also inevitably suffered the disaster of being implicated. Temples and monasteries scattered in various districts and streets, and statues of bodhisattvas, mostly formed an indissoluble bond with the God of Fire, and ascended to heaven together; only the "Tianfu Bodhisattva" remained in the mortal world. The ignorant people, blindly believing in its power, made the incense particularly prosperous at that time.</p>
<p>The total loss of this Changsha holocaust, according to the comprehensive survey by the city's Provisional Fire Relief Committee, is estimated as follows: there were 31,884 houses, of which 20,838 were completely destroyed, 290 were partially destroyed, and 10,747 remain. About two-thirds of the entire city was destroyed.</p>
<p>The number of deaths in the fire, according to the organizations responsible for burying the bodies, totaled 656. However, among them, there were those who froze to death, starved to death, and died of illness. It is difficult to determine how many were burned to death, but it is estimated to be around 500. Among them, there were 220 bodies resembling wounded soldiers. Most of the others who died of illness, starvation, and freezing were also wounded soldiers (those who were scattered and missing were not included), which is particularly regrettable! It is urgently hoped that the central government and the responsible agencies in various war zones should take full responsibility for the treatment of wounded soldiers in the future, and strive to properly ensure the safety of these wounded and sick soldiers, which is the way to preserve soldiers with rich combat experience, and to enhance the nation's morale in resisting the war. According to the Changsha Municipal Government, the number of injured was about 27, and the number of displaced people was about 254,507.</p>
<p>The property loss is currently not accurate. If estimated according to the Changsha Municipal Government's estimate for the eight towns and four townships under its jurisdiction, the house loss totaled 89,033,880 yuan, and the goods loss totaled 55,893,010 yuan, but the actual loss should be more than this. It is said that the area of Changsha City is 21 square li, equivalent to 700,000 square zhang. The average construction cost per square zhang is about 400 yuan, so the total loss should be 280 million yuan. Among the 700,000 square zhang, if one-tenth is used as a commodity gathering place, and each square zhang is calculated at 100 yuan, then the commodity loss should be 70 million yuan. Other telephone and electricity projects, public and private equipment, and direct business losses and relief costs are about 50 million yuan, so the total should reach 300 million yuan.</p>
<p>When the fire was spreading, many military and political officials, such as Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, did not leave Changsha, and tried to remedy the situation. In particular, after receiving the telegram, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately came to console the people and took the following four measures: first, arrest the responsible persons and punish them severely according to the law; second, allocate huge sums of money to relieve the affected people; third, mobilize heavy troops to strengthen Changsha's defense; fourth, reorganize the local military and police institutions to handle all the aftermath.</p>
<p>Commander Chen of the × War Zone immediately ordered Commander Yu Jishi of the ×× Army Corps to lead his troops to guard Changsha and Zhuzhou, and to do their best to maintain order and restore traffic. The Political Department also sent a large number of staff to Changsha to manage the work of comforting and providing relief to the victims. The Political Work Brigade of the Ninth War Zone also entered Changsha to handle the aftermath of the disaster area. There was also a large team of cadres from the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese War United Committee who rushed from Xiangxiang overnight (the team members were reorganized from the battlefield service corps concentratedly trained by Hunan high school students, and they were all enthusiastic young people who volunteered to serve on the front line). They all used their dragon-like and tiger-like skills to implement the four aftermath principles personally ordered by Chairman Chiang. The tense working scene at that time was simply like Changsha, whose body had just been burned to ashes by a wildfire, being revived spiritually.</p>
<p>First of all, the responsible persons for the fire, the Provincial Garrison Commander 　Ti, the Second Regiment Commander of the Provincial Garrison Brigade Xu Kun, and the Provincial Police Chief Wen Chongfu, etc., were arrested by the Hunan Provincial Government and sent to the Military Affairs Commission to organize a high-level military trial, sentenced to death, and executed. At the same time, the Director of Security Xu Quan was also removed from his post for investigation, and Changsha Mayor Xi Chulin was also dismissed but retained in his post. Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong felt deeply guilty for misusing his subordinates and requested the central government to punish him severely. He was ordered to be dismissed but retained, and ordered to handle the aftermath. As a result, the anger of the generally affected citizens was slightly appeased.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the aftermath, the Provisional Fire Relief Committee of Changsha City was quickly formed to expand the provisional relief; the funding was determined to be 500,000 yuan (including 200,000 yuan issued by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and 300,000 yuan raised by the Hunan Provincial Government). Many disaster relief centers, temporary markets, and food distribution points were established to provide food and accommodation for the victims who did not want to leave the province; those who were not in the provincial capital, but were at the evacuation destinations registered with the Education Department before the disaster, were given 2 jiao and 5 fen of foreign currency for every 30 li of distance, plus 3 jiao of foreign currency for relief. Those who wanted to run small businesses were given loans of 10 yuan. On December 9th, a one-time emergency relief of 5 yuan was issued. It was estimated in advance that no more than 20,000 to 30,000 people would receive this emergency relief, but the result exceeded the predetermined number by about two times, and tens of thousands of yuan of relief funds were issued. In total, 110,000 victims received relief. Based on the past population of Changsha of 300,000, there were still more than 100,000 people outside the grace of the country.</p>
<p>Although Changsha is now mostly in ruins, due to the improvement of the front-line situation and the drive for survival, more and more people are returning to the city and building temporary houses on the ruins. In some areas, the population has increased compared to before the fire, creating a prosperous atmosphere. However, excessive concentration of population is extremely dangerous, and enemy aircraft have bombed the area once since the disaster, so the provincial government has to find ways to resettle the people.</p>
<p>Regarding the permanent construction agency in Changsha, the Changsha Post-Disaster Reconstruction Committee was also established. A fund of 10 million yuan was allocated from the Hunan Construction Public Bonds of the 27th year of the Republic, and construction experts have also been recruited. The first manifestation of this work is the city-wide solicitation of plans for the construction of the New Changsha District. According to Zhang Zhizhong, chairman of the committee: "However, this is still a plan, and the time is not yet right for implementation." Originally, our war against Japan will be difficult to completely resolve in the short term. All our new construction projects must be planned for a longer and more practical period. In other words, the construction of New Changsha during the war of resistance should be centered on military affairs. It should not only build a new, beautiful city with air defense facilities, but also a military fortress suitable for long-term war resistance. So as to avoid repeating the mistakes of the construction of Nanjing and Shanghai, which were ridiculed as "gardens without walls," and were trampled by beasts. Finally, what I want to describe is the truth about the cause of the fire, which is also the main point of what I want to write; although this is not an easy task. Fortunately, the cause of the fire has been investigated and announced by all parties: 1. It was caused by the local military and police officials mistakenly believing rumors, being unprepared beforehand, and being rash and flustered at the time; 2. It was because the people who had engaged in destruction preparation, and the people (members of the self-defense corps, Ding Sen, etc.), in view of the enemy aircraft's continuous bombing... aroused by national indignation, believed that the enemy was coming, and immediately set fire to their houses, which led to the preparation work turning into action. As a result, a fire broke out in one place, and it spread everywhere, until it became out of control.</p>
<p>In "general principles," the main cause of the Changsha fire was indeed the above two points; however, how did the facts evolve, and how was the disaster mechanism formed? It seems that it is still difficult to give a concrete answer at present. However, it is of course inappropriate for villains to take the opportunity to fabricate and spread rumors, and spread various rumors.</p>
<p>In fact, the strict investigation of the chief culprits of the Changsha fire, in the final analysis, is of course "Japanese ××." The huge sacrifices and losses caused by the Changsha fire should be recorded in the general account of Japanese aggression and plunder against us, and we should settle it all together in the struggle to win the war of resistance. On the other hand, the motives of those who should be held responsible for the fire on our side are "to avoid helping the enemy" and "out of indignation"... Then, tracing the original intention, their criminal behavior can be attributed to the "errors of gentlemen," which is somewhat understandable. Based on this meaning, the specific causes of the fire that I have heard, choosing the ones that are closer to reason, are generally recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First, our army withdrew from Yueyang on November 11, and the enemy continued to invade southward along the railway line. The next morning (12th), Changsha was filled with rumors, and people's hearts were restless. In terms of military deployment, when our army withdrew from Yueyang, the × Brigade Commander led his troops to serve as the covering force. The × Regiment Commander was ordered to lead his elite troops to attack a strong enemy position near Yueyang late at night on the 11th, and was scheduled to return to a certain place the next morning after completing a certain task. Regiment Commander × was extremely brave in combat, and this time he was determined to die. That night, he led his troops to bravely attack the enemy, advancing and retreating repeatedly, and falling forward and following each other. Finally, he broke into the enemy's position, and was about to retreat according to plan, but unexpectedly, because of the bloody battle lasting too long, it was already dawn, and enemy aircraft suddenly flew into the air to bomb wildly, and enemy artillery also concentrated on the position to bombard fiercely. As a result, Regiment Commander × and the remaining less than one-third of his remnants had no choice but to temporarily remain in the original position to cover the resistance, and waited for the enemy's firepower to weaken slightly before rushing out. The situation was helpless, and there was nothing else to do.</p>
<p>Brigade Commander × stayed in a certain place overnight, but still did not return after the time had passed. He was worried in his heart, and gradually had the thought of "easy to go, hard to return" for Regiment Commander × and his troops. Later, he received a report from a liaison officer that they had broken into the enemy's position, but had not come out again. As a result, he believed that the entire unit must have made a heroic sacrifice. Moreover, Brigade Commander × feared that there were not many remaining soldiers beside him. Fearing that the enemy would take advantage of the situation to cover up, he would not only be trapped in heavy siege, but also would not be able to report back. Therefore, he thought of marching 　and retreating to Miluo, and quickly reported to Changsha, and said that he had not seen our army deploying defenses along the way. What an emergency alert in Changsha! Before long, Regiment Commander × also led dozens of remnants to rush out of the enemy's position and rushed to Miluo to confront them. The reported situation was even more dangerous. As a result, they were both ordered by the Commander-in-Chief's office to return to a certain place on the front line to await orders from their direct superior and participate in the war.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out here that the two urgent reports from Brigade Commander × and Regiment Commander ×, both on the night of the 12th, had a fear-inducing stimulus to the hearts of the people, which was no different from two ignition charms.</p>
<p>What poured oil on the ignition charms was the sudden news that × cavalry had attacked near Miluo that night!</p>
<p>Looking at the strategies adopted by the enemy in invading our northern and southern battlefields, in addition to often playing the two old tricks of "central breakthrough" and "outflanking encirclement," they also used a small trick: when occupying each of our central cities, they would drive dozens of Mongolian puppet light cavalry to disrupt our rear with gunshots, deliberately creating suspicious formations. They threatened our retreat. For example, when we were stalemated with the enemy in the Jin'guanqiao area of the Nanxun Road, and fierce fighting was taking place in Ruichang, a small number of enemy cavalry initially moved towards the southeastern area of Ruichang. The defending army did not understand the situation, allowing them to take the opportunity to窜into Xintangbu Minshan, threatening the southeast side of our Nanxun Road. Also, when Wuhan was withdrawing, we still had some military supplies waiting to be transported in Huayuan, but because a small group of enemy cavalry suddenly disrupted the territory of Yingshan, we were unable to transport them out in a hurry. Now, the intention of the enemy cavalry disrupting near Miluo is nothing more than this. If it succeeds, it will be a great benefit, and if it fails, it will be a small loss. Later, although the defense line north of Pingjiang Miluo was strengthened with troops, the position was stabilized, and the attacking enemy army was repelled, Changsha, which was full of fire, was unfortunately sparked by the pouring of this ruthless fire oil, and the unprecedented prairie fire broke out!</p>
<p>However, at the most dangerous moment before the fire, that is, when Changsha was preparing to implement destruction of military-related buildings to prevent them from being used by the enemy and it was considered to be the final juncture, there was still a most important focus: whether the culprit 鄷悌 and others had received any order related to the fire. It is said that there was no order, but there were various rumors. Moreover, 鄷悌 and others were still calling for injustice when they were executed. It is said that there was an order, but the relevant parties absolutely deny it, and there is no conclusive evidence to rely on. As the saying goes, "What is the ultimate merit and sin of the Changsha fire? It can only be left to historians to study."</p>
<p>One theory is that since Changsha was facing the war zone, the timing of the pre-prepared destruction was originally said to wait until the enemy had reached 30 li from Changsha before the action could begin; but 鄷悌, in his panic and eagerness, listened to the telephone and mistook 30 li for 300 li, and the distance from Miluo to Changsha happened to be 300 li, and thus made a big mistake.</p>
<p>In wartime, the methods used to transmit orders, such as telegrams, telephones, flag signals, sound signals, notes, and verbal instructions, each have advantages and disadvantages. During the Xuzhou Battle in the past, a certain engineer team suddenly received a telephone call from its superiors one afternoon, ordering it to "bake tofu and fried dough sticks" at that time; the team did not know why, and after further inquiry, it turned out to be a mistake for "bombing Bengbu Yangqiao." Also, Mr. Feng ×× once convened a meeting of officers above the rank of major in a certain army in Nanyang for a training session, and ordered each to bring "Tactics" (book title), but later the messenger mistakenly heard each to bring "family members," which led to the joke that the trainees actually brought their wives to the lecture hall together. By analogy, it is difficult to believe that the mistake of 300 li for 30 li is certain, but it is not impossible.</p>
<p>A certain commander casually mentioned the Changsha fire in a casual conversation on a certain occasion, and said indifferently: The death of 鄷悌 and others was not without sacrifice for their duties. He then turned to his subordinates and continued: In the military, when there are important orders or reports, it is best to execute them based on documents, or at least record them at the time to prevent errors, and so on. Although the words are irrelevant, they are not without purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Han, deputy director of the Changsha Fire Relief Committee, said about the fire: "Today, we must put the war of resistance first. There is no need to make useless complaints afterwards, so as not to distract our attention from the Japanese aggressors, and we should make the most of our efforts in the difficult task of cleaning up the broken bricks and tiles... so that Changsha can still play an important supporting role in the rear of the war of resistance." His words are heartfelt, and I cannot help but feel the same.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Our Counter-Offensive in Hebei and Shandong is Going Smoothly / The Enemy is Busy and Chaotic with Troop Movements / The Battle in Hubei is Still Fierce and Stalemate <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Bureau on the 26th] News compiled on the evening of the 25th: There are no changes in the overall war situation. The enemy is still busy with troop movements and deployments in the valley. Major battles in South China and Northwest China are brewing. The enemy's attacks on us in the occupied areas such as Hebei and Shandong are still fierce, but due to our successful counter-offensive, the situation has stabilized. According to a telegram from Guilin, the number of enemy troops that have arrived on Hainan Island is still less than two divisions to date and are still urgently invading our inland areas. Enemy aircraft are constantly flying low and bombing various places on the island every day, seemingly focusing on attacking our guerrilla forces in the coastal counties, attempting to quickly establish a puppet regime and build air and naval bases, and further attempting to cut off our communication with the island. However, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, we have also created many heroic achievements and inflicted great blows on the enemy. It is absolutely impossible for the enemy to occupy the entire island in the short term as they claim. The local battles in central Hubei are still fierce, and our troops and the enemy are in a stalemate near Tianmen and Jingshan. In western Shanxi, we are besieging Xiaxian and have gained a lot of ×獲. The railway on the Tongpu Line has been damaged and cut off in many places by us. The enemy in Yuncheng is attempting to invade westward, and we have taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Bureau on the 26th] Telegram from Guilin: The battle situation on Hainan Island is still fierce. The enemy continues to invade inland along the highway in Wenchang, Anding, and Chengmai. After our interception, there have been many casualties. Enemy aircraft are still constantly bombing the island. The enemy in southern Guangdong is still busy with troop movements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 26th] On the morning of the 24th, more than 100 enemy infantry, with two artillery pieces, went to Taipingchang, Huangniguo, Yinxi Cave, and Shiqianshi to search for food ××. They were attacked by our guerrillas along the way and suffered heavy casualties. They then retreated to Taipingchang in defeat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 26th] There were 400 enemy troops in Shilong. Wen Zhongping, the pseudo-maintenance chairman of Liaobu, was assassinated by local patriotic villagers on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Bureau, 26th] Telegram from Luoyang: Our strength in the occupied areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Chahar has increased, and we can control the overall situation in the future. The enemy's plan to clear the occupied areas will become a bubble. Our politics are being actively promoted under the principle of adapting to the war of resistance.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Xi'an Bureau on the 29th] More than 500 enemy troops attacked Songgang, Lixian on the 24th and are currently engaged in a fierce battle. The enemy intends to attack Suning again.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Bureau, 25th] It is reported that the enemy on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is concentrating food and military supplies in Xuzhou, attempting to invade westward. The enemy on the Nanxun Line is recently forcibly recruiting laborers to repair roads, attempting to attack Nanchang. Our army has strict deployments on these lines. If the enemy invades, they will be severely hit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] News from Tianjin: The enemy has been publicizing an encirclement battle in central Hebei. Recent battle reports show that the enemy has been besieged by us in Nangong, Jixian, and Juye. Our guerrillas have repeatedly achieved victories. Our army adopts a strategy of "clearing the fields and strengthening the walls" after the enemy arrives, 　围 from all sides. When the enemy entered Nangong City, there was no rice or firewood, and no place to find water, and the enemy's supply line was cut off. Therefore, after a few days, the enemy could not stand and窜去 in full numbers. The enemy's losses were very heavy. In the recent battle in the Jixian area of Shanxi, the enemy's losses exceeded those of the Pingxingguan campaign, it is said.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 26th] The purpose of the enemy's recent westward invasion in central Hubei is to expand the security line on the southern side of the Pinghan Railway, consolidate 　 defense of various strongholds, and prevent our counter-offensive. Recently, although they have constantly sent small units to take advantage of opportunities to invade, they are also guerrilla in nature. They retreat immediately when we counterattack. Currently, the right wing front line is still confronting near the Yuekou檄厂集.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Suiyuan Unable to Control; Mongol Puppet Troops Waver; After Reorganization, Only Several Thousand Remain in the German-Li Puppet Troops; Guisui Traitors Hiding in the City Are Panic-Stricken <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hequ, 20th] A person arriving from Guisui states that the puppet army's strength in Suiyuan is extremely weak. Constantly fearing attacks from our guerrilla forces, sandbags are piled up at every remote alley entrance, blocking traffic. Defenses are only set up and maintained at major thoroughfares. A broadcasting machine is installed on the old city drum tower, and communication personnel are stationed in villages within a dozen or so *li*. In case of emergency, lights are immediately used as signals, and the broadcasting machine reports the news to the soldiers and civilians of both cities, who quickly prepare for defense. Because of insufficient troops, Japanese and Korean merchants are conscripted during the day and formed into guard teams at night. Due to financial constraints, a dismissal and reorganization meeting was convened a month ago, and the Mongol puppet troops were greatly reduced in number. Although the German Wang and Li Shou-xin rebel factions are nominally called ten divisions, they actually only number several thousand. After the reorganization, their numbers were further reduced. Furthermore, the Mongol puppet troops were ordered to be organized separately and not to be mixed or connected, for fear that their strength would be too great to control. The two traitors, German Wang and Li, and the puppet Mongol troops are very resentful of these measures and may revolt at any time. The puppet army's strength in each county is also very weak. Although reinforcements are sent from time to time, ostensibly to increase defenses, in reality, this is just a consistent deception tactic. Everywhere, one sees emptiness and panic. The highest political organizations are nominally the puppet Mongol Autonomous Government and Provincial Government, with German Wang as a puppet. However, another office is set up, entirely controlled by the Japanese, who wield real administrative power. The *tuanwei* (local defense corps) and police organized by local gentry in each county have recently been changed, replaced by trusted Han traitors of the Japanese. This can be described as "once the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked," serving as a warning to those who willingly act as Han traitors. Because our guerrilla forces are lying in ambush in the suburbs, the puppet regime's decrees are currently difficult to implement outside the city gates, leaving them at a loss. In recent months, the puppet regime has twice launched large-scale encirclements of the Daqingshan Mountains, attempting to destroy the bases of our guerrilla forces, but ultimately failing to achieve their goals. Therefore, they have recently intensified their efforts, employing both hard and soft tactics, driving residents along the Ping-Sui railway line and both sides of the highway to move to areas designated by the puppet regime. Those who disobey the order are slaughtered, intending to "strengthen the walls and clear the fields" to control the lurking activities of our guerrilla forces. These desperate actions of the puppet regime are in vain and will ultimately be of no avail.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai dispatch: Regarding the Japanese demands, sources familiar with the matter say that the U.S. Consulate is taking an increasingly firm stance against Japan. The details of this incident have not been announced by relevant parties, but U.S. Consul General Gauss and many consulate staff members are now working late into the night, exchanging telegrams with Washington frequently, resembling the situation during the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a public announcement at 8:00 PM tonight that Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden visited Japanese Consul General Miura at 6:00 PM this afternoon and personally delivered the Council's reply to the Japanese demands of the 21st. This reply is currently under study by the Japanese diplomatic, naval, and military authorities. Japan is scheduled to submit another note on the 27th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] Tianjin dispatch: × and the British have decided to implement a second blockade of the French Concession in Tianjin. On the 24th, Tianjin × convened a meeting of relevant personnel and urged them to handle the matter as soon as possible. The specific methods have been largely determined and will be even stricter than before.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Tianjin dispatch: Japanese troops are erecting electric fences and barriers between the Special District (former German Concession) and the British Concession. Since the barracks of the U.S. Marine Corps are located near the Special District, this move by the Japanese actually surrounds the U.S. barracks with barriers, indicating that the Japanese's main objective is clearly to deal with the U.S. troops. According to the Japanese Consulate authorities, the Japanese are erecting electric fences around the U.S. Navy barracks to facilitate naval operations. How this statement should be interpreted is unclear to all. The Japanese Consulate claims that this action is unrelated to the new foreign exchange control law that the authorities in North China and Japan are scheduled to implement on March 11. However, in fact, many citizens here are rushing to buy National Government *fapi* currency to purchase foreign exchange before March 11.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai dispatch: Along the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway line, our guerrilla forces launched an attack on Suzhou during the Lunar New Year. On the morning of February 20th, they briefly recovered Likou, less than 30 kilometers from Suzhou, and captured countless spoils of war. As they advanced towards the city, Qing Bai Hong national flags were discovered on the 21st and 22nd at Qimen. National flags were also flying on all bridges along the Suzhou-Shanghai highway, apparently raised by our guerrilla forces as they passed through. Furthermore, our troops blew up various bridges during their passage to cut off the transportation of × troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai dispatch: Because of frequent incidents of the guerrilla forces confiscating weapons, the Pudong puppet police have confiscated all firearms, and the puppet police are now standing guard empty-handed. At around 4:00 PM on the 25th, about seventy or eighty of our guerrilla forces, all carrying light weapons, paraded and demonstrated on the main streets of Pudong, shouting slogans such as "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" At that time, the puppet police, lacking real strength, pretended not to see them. Even the Japanese soldiers in the Takabashi area and the Japanese warships anchored on the river did not dare to move slightly, showing that the Japanese puppets are no longer able to control the situation.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, ××, 26th] An Air Force spokesperson told reporters that the ×Headquarters announced on January 20th of the 28th year (1939) that since the start of the invasion war until December 31st of the 27th year (1938), a total of 710 army and navy aircraft were lost. Another 300 were damaged beyond repair, totaling 1,010 aircraft. The results of verification and our statistics coincide. Of these, 221 were shot down in the air by our Air Force, 179 were destroyed by our Air Force bombing, 88 were shot down by our anti-aircraft units, 107 were destroyed by our army attacks, 11 were destroyed by our artillery, 19 ×planes landed on their own, and 27 were shot down by us but their whereabouts are unknown, or severely damaged and forced to land in × territory, totaling 647. In addition, based on the minimum damage rate due to flight accidents, an estimated 363 aircraft (the actual number is certainly more than this), totaling 1,010 aircraft, with an average monthly loss of more than 56 aircraft, can be said to be an extremely heavy loss. Since the beginning of the 28th year (1939), 24 aircraft have been shot down or destroyed by our Air Force, anti-aircraft artillery, and army units. Among them, our brave Air Force warriors shot down 15 of the latest and most advanced heavy bombers recently purchased from Europe and the West over Lanzhou, giving the ×Air Force a serious blow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 26th] A Japanese military spokesperson recently admitted that during a recent Japanese air raid on Lanzhou, a fierce air battle took place with the Chinese Air Force. As a result, three Japanese aircraft were shot down, killing three sergeants and fifteen aviators. It is said that one aircraft was also shot down during the raid on Lanzhou on the 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e15">President Kong Reports at the National Political Council; International Situation Improves; Continued from Yesterday <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>—One of the March Political Reports—</p>
<p>The international situation will inevitably become more perilous. People with vision in various countries, seeing this point, all want to unite, pool their wisdom and efforts, and find ways to salvage the situation. The World Anti-Aggression Conference was formed in this way. Last summer, American civilians initiated a "Committee Against Participation in Japanese Aggression Actions," with the aim of encouraging the American people to voluntarily refrain from providing Japan with tools of aggression. Because although merchants may not intend to participate in aggression, supplying Japan with tools of aggression is actually equivalent to participating. This association is a civilian movement in the United States, unrelated to the government. Their starting point is not treaty obligations or national interests, but individual conscience and righteous indignation. Recently, Mr. Stimson has taken on the role of honorary president, and their work will surely become more active and effective. The Japanese *zaibatsu* may despise such actions based on conscience and righteous indignation, but we are fighting for peace and justice. Our victory or defeat is not determined by temporary advances or retreats on the battlefield. Moral victory is the foundation of our ultimate victory and a sign of our ultimate victory.</p>
<p>The improvement in the international situation is, of course, due to the unity, sincerity, loyalty, and bravery of our entire military and civilians under the leadership of the Supreme Commander. The Japanese government's ambition, which has become even more evident since the statement was issued, is also a very important reason. When the September 18th Incident first occurred, we announced to the world that it was the beginning of Japan's unlimited ambition. However, the world's observation of us was always half-believing and half-doubting, thinking that our propaganda was inevitably exaggerated. When we withdrew from Wuhan and the interests of the lower Yangtze River were monopolized by the ×people, and Konoe and Arita formally declared the true face of the Japanese government, various countries' governments and people finally understood the treachery, and their attitudes naturally changed accordingly. Chairman Chiang has already announced his views on the Konoe-Arita statement on December 26th. I don't need to repeat his words. But what we want to specifically point out is that the Chairman's views coincide with the notes of the British, American, and French governments. For example, the Chairman said, "If China recognizes Konoe's 'New Order in East Asia' and 'Japan-Manchuria-China Cooperative Relations,' it would be turning all of China's territory into a large concession owned by Japan." The conclusion of the British note also said, "His Majesty's Government cannot understand how Prince Konoe can declare that Japan does not want China to cede territory and respects Chinese sovereignty, while at the same time saying that Japan must forcibly impose conditions on China that have no other effect than to place China's political, economic, and cultural life completely under Japanese control, allowing Japanese troops to be stationed in China indefinitely, and almost completely separating Inner Mongolia from China." In a broadcast speech on November 3rd, Konoe said that the Sino-Japanese war "is a tragedy of fratricide." This statement makes sense, but who caused the tragedy between China and Japan? Whose fault is it that the tragedy continues to unfold? This responsibility, needless to say, should be borne by the militarists of Japan. In recent years, the Japanese have often liked to present themselves as protectors of Eastern civilization, wanting to use the name of Eastern culture to appeal and attempt to organize an Eastern bloc to deal with Europe and America. But in this war, what is the purpose and what are the means of Japan? Where is the element of civilization, and where is the spirit of Eastern civilization? In fact, China is the source of Eastern civilization. Japanese culture was given to them by China. Now our resistance to Japanese aggression is fulfilling our responsibility to protect the culture of the East. Last month, a professor at Oxford University said in a letter to Chairman Chiang, "British people used to have some doubts about the true meaning and value of Chinese culture and scholarship. But today, on the one hand, in view of the tyranny and hatred of narrow nationalism, and on the other hand, in view of the solemn and composed attitude of China's anti-Japanese stance, we can no longer doubt who is the leader of world culture." This is the judgment of famous scholars in the world regarding the leadership of culture. Japanese enlightened people, after reading this, I wonder what they would think.</p>
<p>Upon careful examination, the reason why Japanese propagandists are so eager to talk about cultural issues at this tense time of war is nothing more than two purposes. First, they want to use the confrontation between Eastern and Western cultures to drive out the forces of Europe and America in East Asia, create a Japanized New Order in East Asia, and complete their dream of a "Manchuria-Japan-China" linkage - a whole set of tricks. Without knowing that Eastern culture is the spiritual heritage passed down by our ancestors for thousands of years, we should of course do our best to promote and carry it forward. But the way to promote it cannot be to be complacent and self-enclosed, nor can it be to fabricate a situation of East-West confrontation. We firmly believe that communication between Eastern and Western cultures is beneficial to both sides. The Japanese should not forget their history of the Meiji Restoration. The so-called Meiji Restoration was to accept Western civilization, such as science, engineering, and constitutional government, on the basis of Eastern civilization. If it were not for the enlightened people of Japan in the Meiji era who humbly accepted Western civilization, Japan would probably still be in the dark age of the shogunate division of politics. Now Japan has turned around and rejected Western civilization. Konoe even said that the discord between China and Japan was caused by the influence of the reactionary tide after the European war. But which is reactionary, China or Japan?</p>
<p>The second slogan of the Japanese propagandists is joint anti-communism. They believe that by raising the banner of anti-communism or defense against communism, they can confuse the world's perception and make the world believe that their war of aggression is a war against communism. In fact, now who doesn't know that the Japanese warlords have only the plunder of China's resources in their minds, and there is no such thing as any kind of *ism*. Does a nation with a history and an *ism* need external instigation to fight for its own survival?</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of this war, China tried hard to avoid it, but could not avoid it. Then what other method do we have besides resistance? Now the new Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma declares that Japan must invade to the end based on its established national policy. I also do not hesitate to repeat that China must resist to the end based on its established national policy.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the exposure of ×people's conspiracies and the changes in the international situation in the recent three months, our future response to diplomacy, besides making every effort to respond to ×people based on our established national policy, we should especially pay attention to propaganda, trying to awaken the Japanese people, making them understand the crisis of their own country, stopping their suicidal actions, in order to restore peace in East Asia as soon as possible. To various countries, we should cultivate good relations based on the ancient training of repaying kindness with kindness and repaying injustice with justice, so that those who are close to us will be more helpful to us, and the friendship of those who are distant from us will gradually increase, in order to harmonize all nations and promote international cooperation. To the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, we should urge them to be implemented as much as possible. To the necessary laws and order in the international community, as well as the dignity of treaties, we should consult with relevant countries and make joint efforts to maintain them.</p>
<p>Although the international situation has improved, we must still make our greatest efforts at all times and never have a mind to rely on luck. The Anti-War and National Reconstruction Program formulated by the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang last year, the so-called simultaneous advancement of anti-war and national reconstruction, is because national reconstruction is not possible without resistance to Japan's aggression. So this time the anti-war can be called the war of national reconstruction in the future history. Secondly, because during the anti-war period, all facilities should strive to conform to the country's century-long plan, we cannot follow the old ways or get by with what we have. Our work in this great era must take into account the present and the future, and must be beneficial to the anti-war as well as national reconstruction. (To be continued, the following is the domestic affairs section)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Visiting Old Mrs. Zhao <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>【Special Air Dispatch from Kunming】A struggling China has produced countless heroic warriors—a great China has created countless great historical achievements!</p>
<p>Recalling the Northeast after its fall, countless heroic men and women emerged, running between the mountains and rivers, constantly striking the enemy. In the rural areas of Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, the roar of those unwilling to be slaves erupted: "Treat resistance as life, and the guerrilla隊 as family." From February of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) to the present, Old Mrs. Zhao has led her family, responding to the enemy's brutal aggression with bullets and bayonets. She has traveled from beyond the Pass to North China, then from North China to Central China, then to South China, then to Southeast Asia, and then to Annam. What is the reason for this? To fight for the motherland and win glory. Furthermore, she has not only made the compatriots in the places she has been to see the ferocious faces of Eastern fascist enemy, but also made the compatriots in the places she has passed through see the victorious future of resisting the Japanese and building the nation.</p>
<p>On the evening of February 2nd, Old Mrs. Zhao Hongwenguo, accompanied by Wang Aiqun of the Northeast National Salvation General Association and Wang Yue, two subordinates of Zhao Tong's troops, arrived in Kunming. This resounding bell, this "mother of the guerrilla隊," this female revolutionary warrior, this reporter had the opportunity to meet her. It was like seeing the red light of a torch, and starting to talk with her was like hearing the sound of a loud bell.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Zhao is very short in stature, with bronze-colored skin and wrinkles covering her face, showing the brave traces of her struggle. The felt hat she wears and the qipao she wears are both as dark as iron. Her front teeth have fallen out, and her temples are as frosty as snow. She is already fifty-eight years old. However, shining on her face is the color of youth, and filled in her eyes is a sharp light. On her body, we cannot see the slightest sign of aging; on the contrary, contained in her body is strength! Strength! Strength! The strength of a young person, the strength of copper and iron!</p>
<p>She first said to the reporter: "Since the 'September 18th Incident,' when the Japanese occupied the Northeast, I didn't know anything, I only knew that Japan wanted to destroy our China, and Japan is my enemy! So I donated my family property and risked my life to organize a guerrilla隊 to strike the enemy, because I thought, who will protect those who have lost their country! Only each person with a knife or a gun can protect themselves, otherwise... I am already fifty-eight years old, what else is there to think about!" She took a sip of tea and loudly continued: "I don't want to be a family mother, I want to be a mother to the masses, so I organized the guerrilla隊. My children and grandchildren, a total of more than thirty people, I sent them all into the guerrilla隊, because I think every mother should send her children to the front line to fight with the enemy, and every mother should also join the front line." Old Mrs. Zhao said here, and the gentlemen present all applauded. The old lady said even louder: "Since young people have gone to the front line, what are we old people still living for? Everyone thinks that the rear is safe, and runs towards the rear as much as possible, but is the rear really safe? In many places I have been, I often see corpses strewn across the fields, all sent to their deaths by the brutal enemy. Aren't those in the rear, why were they bombed to death? I think if they had gone to the front line, perhaps it would not be like this. I have been in the guerrilla隊 for a full seven years, from the Northeast to North China to Central China, and South China, but I have not died!" She laughed twice very proudly, and continued: "We don't want to die in bed, we don't want to die at home, we don't want to die in the rear, we go to the front line! Who knows that the front line will not necessarily make us die! Everyone must kill a Japanese person, and if they sacrifice, it counts as fulfilling their responsibility for the country. If they shed blood, then they are the descendants of the Republic of China! Everyone must fight enemy imperialism and resist to the end, this is what everyone knows, but many people only shout slogans and do not act. Therefore, these people are discovered by the enemy and considered hateful, so planes and artillery are fired at them all at once. I am not like that, I want to fire bullets into the Japanese body before I make a sound!" At this time, her voice became even higher and asked the reporter if he agreed with her opinion. Just as the reporter excitedly replied to her question and uttered the word "yes," she said again with great energy: "When I went to Southeast Asia, many overseas Chinese came to welcome me. Among them, most were important figures. I told them that your grand welcome to me really makes me feel very uncomfortable, because although I have been fighting with the enemy since 1918, but seven years have passed without any result, and the country is now in danger. I have come here not to ask you for money, nor to publicize to you, I have come here to bring you the news that the motherland is in danger, hoping that you will hurry back to save the country. The compatriots in Southeast Asia are also very concerned about the War of Resistance and are working hard. At that time, many of them wanted to return to China with me to join the guerrilla隊, but due to various reasons, I could not allow them..."</p>
<p>The reporter then asked her about the recent guerrilla situation in the Northeast. She responded: "The righteous volunteer guerrilla隊 in the Northeast are rushing to the front line to strike the enemy. The guerrilla隊 in North China are fighting in the vicinity of Ping. Since the fall of the Northeast seven years ago, the guerrilla隊 I have organized number about 20,000 people, fighting in the Northeast and North China, from the Changbai Mountains to the Taihang Mountains. My wish is for everyone to unite, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of North or South, and everyone support the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. I have been preaching everywhere for several years, preaching the way to defeat enemy imperialism..." Her angry expression gradually became tense, and her wrinkles changed in blocks, further discussing her family's heroic story of resisting the enemy. The loud voice conveyed the brave historical achievements, making the reporter feel like listening to a great recitation poem. The more she spoke, the more energetic she became, and the more I listened, the more absorbed I became. I felt that the person talking to me was not Old Mrs. Zhao, but Dolores Ibárruri of Spain, or perhaps Chelidona of Sparta, or even Gorky's "Mother"! Pelageya Nilovna Vlasova.</p>
<p>At this time, Old Mrs. Zhao continued to talk to the reporter about the causes and consequences of the Northeast Incident, and also recounted the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, as well as the reasons for the failure of the Taiwan resistance led by General Liu Yongfu. Her conclusion was: "Because at that time our China did not mobilize the masses, we ended up bearing the great yoke of slavery of the 'Treaty of Shimonoseki'!" After severely criticizing the traitorous remarks of Wang Jingwei and his ilk of so-called "traveling without fighting," she said again, "All Chinese people should stand up and stand on the front lines of resisting the enemy and saving the country, and use our flesh and blood to defend the motherland's territory, do not be lazy, do not steal peace! And do not hesitate! The responsibility of those of you who use your pens to participate in the War of Resistance is even greater than the responsibility of those who take up guns to participate in the War of Resistance!" When the reporter shook hands with her to say goodbye, she specially and solemnly spoke these precious words.</p>
<p>Learn from Old Mrs. Zhao's spirit of struggle, and use the action of struggle to put into practice the correct instructions she gave us!</p>

<h3 id="e17">Western Republican Government Accepts British Proposal, Prepares to Negotiate End to Civil War; France Signs Agreement with Franco <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] After the British government decided in principle to recognize the Franco government, it immediately entrusted the Western Republican government's ambassador to Britain, Asgarate, to make a proposal to the authorities in Madrid, asking them to stop the war. The Republican government's foreign minister, Talba育, came here today to talk with the country's president, A省納, for a long time. According to informed sources here, Foreign Minister Talba育 submitted a report to the president, saying that the cabinet meeting had decided to accept the British government's proposal to stop the war in preparation for negotiations with Franco's army to end the civil war. The fact that President A省納 will resign tomorrow has been confirmed by Western Republican government officials here. It is said that A省納 will issue a declaration before his departure, stating that the decision of Britain and France to recognize the Franco government is the reason for his resignation.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] It is rumored that Spanish Republican President A省納 has left the Western Embassy here to go to 薩和, but the Western Embassy denied this yesterday afternoon. It is generally believed that A省納 will soon leave Paris. Regarding the future transfer of the Spanish Embassy to representatives of the Franco government, it is not expected that difficulties will arise. If A省納 leaves for another destination, Spanish Ambassador 馬田尼齊 will also withdraw immediately with all his staff.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Geneva, 26th] The delegation of the Spanish Republican government stationed here at the League of Nations left the country on the direct express train to Paris on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 26th] A communiqué was issued here stating, "The talks between French parliamentarian 比拉德 and General 佐登納 were held in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and proceeded smoothly, enabling several outstanding issues between the two countries to be resolved satisfactorily." 比拉德 also left for his country after signing an agreement with the Franco government, believing that the task entrusted to him by the French government had come to an end.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] Franco government Foreign Minister 佐登納 and French special envoy 比拉德 signed an agreement in Burgos yesterday. The contents of the agreement have not been officially announced, but it is believed to be related to France's recognition of the Franco government, the handling of Spanish refugee issues, and the return of gold and armaments stored in France. After signing the agreement, 佐登納 immediately reported to General Franco by telephone.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 29th] 比拉德, the representative of the French government who went to the Franco government for negotiations, spoke with Franco by phone this afternoon and then set off to return to Paris. Before his departure, 比拉德 and Franco government Foreign Minister General 佐登納 signed three documents, and complete coordination has been achieved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Andaye City, Southern France, 25th] French Senator 比拉德 signed an agreement with Franco government Prime Minister and Foreign Minister General 佐登納 at noon today. The content is divided into three protocols, which have firmly decided the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and the Franco government. 比拉德 returned to this place from Burgos City at 8 pm and immediately took a car to the city of 聯往翰德呂士, used a long-distance telephone to report everything to Foreign Minister 龐萊, and then returned to Paris at 10 pm.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 26th] The Spanish Franco government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Saturday that the Bolivian government of South America has formally recognized the Franco government as the sole regime in Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] According to sources in London, Franco has submitted to British representative in Burgos, 赫哲森, written guarantees regarding the issue of retaliation and the maintenance of Spanish integrity. The document contains the policies of the Spanish National Army, but does not undertake any commitment or request recognition of the Spanish National Army government as an exchange condition. It states that after the Spanish National Army completely occupies Spain, except for criminals, those captured will not be subject to retaliatory treatment. At the same time, maintaining the integrity of Spanish territory is the position of the Spanish government. Although this type of written guarantee differs slightly from the original intention of the British government, London officials expressed satisfaction with this guarantee. It is believed that when the Spanish National Army appoints an ambassador to the UK in the future, 亞爾巴, who has been stationed in London since the outbreak of the Spanish War, will be the natural first ambassador.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] The British government has already drafted a document recognizing the Spanish National Army and is currently storing it temporarily in the Foreign Office, pending delivery to the Spanish National Army representative in London, 亞爾巴, on Sunday. It is expected that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a special speech on the Spanish issue in the House of Commons on Sunday. When the document recognizing the Spanish National Army is delivered to 亞爾巴, Chamberlain will simultaneously instruct British representative stationed in Burgos 赫哲森 to inform Franco of Britain's intention to recognize the Spanish National Army. Because of the issues arising from the recognition of the Spanish National Army, the British ambassador and chargé d'affaires stationed in the Spanish government army will lose their diplomatic status. Therefore, the British government must find a proper solution to entrust all the benefits enjoyed by Britain within the Spanish government army to the British Consul for full responsibility. This move is also very possible.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Britain Prepares to Allocate £10 Million for Trade War with Dictatorial Nations; Britain and Germany to Hold Trade Negotiations <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[London, 25th] The British government is prepared at any time to allocate tens of millions of pounds for the cost of protecting trade, if there is no possibility of understanding with the dictatorial nations, that is, if the dictatorial nations do not stop their policy of dumping cheap labor, then this move is imperative. For example, if a German car sells for 100 pounds abroad, a British car will reduce the price to 90 pounds. Another example is that if a Japanese cotton coat sells for one shilling, the British charge six pence. In order to maintain foreign trade, Britain will not hesitate to use all its strength to counter it. The biggest problem in this is the automobile industry. Britain and Germany are currently competing fiercely in the world vehicle market. However, the German car production rate has obviously increased greatly, and Britain cannot but worry about it. Today, the capital of thousands of British merchants and the lives of thousands of workers are on the verge of danger. Unless the two countries can conclude an agreement, Britain and Germany will inevitably flow into a bitter trade war until Germany's financial resources are exhausted. It is heard that most German industrialists hope to establish an agreement with Britain to stabilize market prices, but unfortunately the Nazi left wing insists that Germany alone should control the world market. This single individual is the most dangerous element. Dr. Fink, who was recently appointed as the German economic dictator, knows that Germany cannot use more than 60 million pounds for trade war needs. On the contrary, Britain can double it and have more than enough. This is the reason why Fink is willing to negotiate with the United Kingdom. As for Hitler's recent loud cry, "We must export goods, otherwise we will only die," this is not a challenge, but a mournful cry for help. If a trade war is not carried out immediately, the British are absolutely certain of victory, because Britain's financial resources, apart from the United States, are more abundant than any other country in the world. British and German representatives will soon convene trade negotiations in Berlin, and this fact is an unforgettable image in the minds of every representative. Sir ラック is the head of the British delegation, and the above-mentioned facts are also the key to his victory. In the process of negotiations, the British side hopes that every industry will seek a uniform sales route and a uniform market price. This Berlin negotiation will have a significant impact on European peace, because Britain has long decided that if the negotiations unfortunately break down, the government will subsidize exporters with a huge amount of money, the amount of which is unprecedented in various countries, and the manufacturing standards of British industry will also be tightened accordingly. All waste or excess will be avoided. At the same time, some industries can reduce styles and concentrate on mass production, which can reduce costs.</p>

<p>[Reuters, 梅爾米, 26th] President Roosevelt recently sent letters to Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, and Lewis, leader of the Committee for Industrial Organizations which opposes him, to persuade them to jointly organize a committee to discuss the unification of the labor movement. Roosevelt said that the division of American labor into two factions is a burden on the future of the labor movement.

<p>[Reuters, Vatican, 25th] The Papal Conclave will be held in the Vatican Palace starting on Wednesday. Approximately 300 bishops and attendants will participate. The conference will last for about four days. When the conference opens, participants will be isolated from the outside world, and all windows in the Vatican will be closed, pending the election of the Pope. Regarding the new Pope, there is much speculation here. Some quarters believe that the position of Pope will belong to the Italians, but the liberal and conservative factions of the church policy will inevitably compete. The liberals support Bishop 巴士里, while the conservatives advocate Bishop 拉維特羅. If the election undergoes changes, and if the two sides are deadlocked, it may be changed to elect pure church figures Bishop 士特 as the Pope. However, these speculations are not certain, and there may still be unexpected results.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 26th] British military authorities have decided to begin deploying the Penang fortress on March 1st. The island is located in northern Malaya and is the gateway to the Indian Ocean and the Straits Settlements. Its geographical position is extremely important and is a natural fortress. In the past, the British military authorities were very worried because there were no fortress fortifications in this place, making it easy to break through.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 2穴th] The new Penang fortress in northern Malaya is designed to prevent attacks from the Indian Ocean. Starting next Wednesday, heavy artillery teams and British Indian troops will be sent from Singapore to defend it. The geographical situation of Penang is an ideal place to set up a fortress. Military points are now fortified, and British people are sincerely afraid that the island will be attacked after the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 26th] According to foreign observers here, the US House of Representatives' rejection of the Guam fortification plan has actually led Japan to change its "easing policy" towards foreign concessions in China. It is found that the Japanese government paid close attention to the US House of Representatives' heated discussion on the Guam fortification and the British House of Commons' fierce debate on Far East affairs. In order to avoid "bad effects of expanding the situation," the Japanese army showed "some goodwill" towards the Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai concessions, and at least did not dare to take excessively active actions. Now that the US Congress has rejected the Guam fortification plan, Japan has seen through the weaknesses of China and the US. Therefore, 24 hours after the news of the US Congress's rejection of the Guam fortification plan came out, the Japanese army in Tianjin immediately built fortifications in the US Navy defense zone and surrounded it. At the same time, similar fortifications were built in the former German concession and the British concession. These measures taken by the Japanese army have obviously exceeded the scope of "necessity." In other words, the actions of the US Congress are tantamount to directly giving the Japanese army supreme encouragement. According to the US Navy, although the US Congress rejected the Guam fortification plan, it has no impact on other naval plans. The US government will consider the issue of the Philippines, because this issue is the focus of the United States' Far East policy.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 26th] After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrives here, he will present for discussion a method of constructing cultural relations between Poland and Italy. An agreement on various cultural collaborations is being drafted by the two governments. Italian and Polish universities will increase the number of professors from each country to exchange various academic knowledge.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 26th] When the Italian Foreign Minister visits Poland, he will discuss how to develop Italian-Polish cultural relations.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] According to reliable sources, Britain and France have agreed to cooperate on the issue of the US fleet exercise. The British government has allowed the US Navy to use British islands near the Caribbean. As for the use of French islands, although negotiations have not been completed, the French side has also expressed in principle that they will allow borrowing "when necessary." The scope of the US naval exercise extends from the Atlantic to the countries of South America. The defense line of the Caribbean Sea is to prevent the enemy from setting up naval bases there. The authorities have not allowed the announcement of who the enemy is, but it is undoubtedly assumed that the enemy is the fascist forces. The offensive base of the hypothetical enemy is far away in Africa. The recent rapid changes in the European situation further prove the need for this US naval exercise.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Marseille, 25th] Three thousand Italians living in various parts of France left France today to return to their country, because Italian Foreign Minister Ciano promised to find them jobs in the country. It is said that the Italian consul in Ajaccio recently notified the Italians there to prepare to return to their country without delay. One thousand of them will soon return to Italy and transfer to Libya for colonization.</p>
<p>[ 通社, Berlin, 26th] This agency reporter has learned from authoritative German sources that the report in yesterday's "Manchester" guide about German troops going to Libya is purely a rumor. Private sources also cannot prove that German troops have been transferred to Libya or Italian East Africa. In addition, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said in an interview with the Citizens' Observer that recently foreign newspapers have pointed out that Germany sent officers to Abyssinia to train colonial strategies, etc. This is the most unwise rumor, the purpose of which is to disturb people's minds and create a terrible situation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] It was announced here yesterday that four former secret police officers abused their authority and falsely accused school children of being politically reactionary and arrested them.

They frankly admitted to the detention of school children aged ten to twelve. This is the third case of its kind this year. The previous two cases occurred in 基夫 and Moscow.

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 26th]  Arctic explorer pilot Levanevsky, who disappeared en route from Moscow to America via the North Pole, radio operator Vonisenesky, is accused of obstructing the search. The trial opened on [date indistinct], with 508 spectators including polar and arctic pilots, staff, and journalists. Vonisenesky's testimony was low. He said, "I could not resist the lonely situation of being alone for long and the adventurous work, and I was already sick." He admitted that he was too tired and stopped the radio, did not receive or send important information about Levanevsky's flight, and transmitted incorrect weather conditions, which delayed the rescue work. When the Moscow authorities suspected his actions, they immediately telegraphed to dismiss him. After receiving the order in secret, he replied, "Levanevsky is dead and his body is missing." The prosecutor stated that Vonisenesky's superior, Grigoriev, was responsible for commanding 27 staff members in the Arctic colony, and failed to strictly supervise Vonisenesky, leading to the delay. He is an enemy of the people, and has also been arrested by the authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Strive for the Defection of Puppet Troops <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Since the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the Japanese invading forces have been unable to continue their advance, and the combat effectiveness of the Japanese army has been declining. Recently, the anti-war rebellions of Japanese army and air force officers and soldiers in various places, and the large-scale defection and brewing of rebellions by puppet troops in various places, are the most important explanations.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Central News Agency in Hequ, 24th, the Suiyuan puppet army's strength is weakening, and the Mongolian puppet troops are brewing a defection. The puppet Prince De and Li Shou-hsin's troops are being reorganized, claiming to be ten divisions, but in reality, there are only a few thousand people. This shows the weakness of the puppet army in North China and its continued brewing of rebellion and defection. Recently, the overall Anti-Japanese War front has been tight, and the Japanese army's forces are becoming increasingly dispersed. The main way to alleviate the crisis of insufficient troops is to organize a large number of puppet troops. Now that there is such instability within the puppet army, it is an important factor increasing the crisis of the Japanese army's collapse.</p>
<p>Regarding expanding political work and actively launching anti-war rebellions by the Japanese army, this newspaper has repeatedly stated its importance. At the same time, with the development of the situation, the work of striving for the defection of puppet troops should still be regarded as one of the major tasks of current political work. However, in this regard, we believe that there are still two points that must be noted: first, the work of striving for defection must have a whole plan, especially targeting the deceptive slogans such as "anti-communism and saving the people" and "national independence" used by the Japanese in organizing puppet troops, the work of striving for puppet troops must be combined with propaganda to strengthen the true meaning of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and unite all ethnic groups in the country to seek liberation. Second, to strive for the defection of puppet troops, we must broadly develop political work in the occupied areas, and at the same time focus on the implementation of democratic politics and the improvement of the people's lives in areas where the government's power reaches, in order to thoroughly smash the Japanese deceptive propaganda of organizing puppet troops and their sinister "appeasement policy."</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Sino-Japanese War and the Anti-Communist Pact <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Chang</p>
<p>Original by ASIATICUS, published in the January issue of "Asia-America Magazine"</p>
<p>Although Germany's strength is expanding day by day, the firm policies of England, America, and France can still prevent fascist aggression. The power of China to support the long-term War of Resistance, the main defense of Hong Kong, and the position of Britain in the Far East are not pessimistic. The expansion of the Japanese Navy has been greatly weakened due to the strengthening of the army. Therefore, any improvement in the position of the Japanese Navy cannot prove the increase in Japanese strength. Japan is now deeply mired in the war against China. If war breaks out in Europe, it will definitely not be able to transfer the main force of its army or navy to attack the Soviet Union. This is beyond doubt. Conversely, the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Army and China's continued resistance are enough to threaten the existence of Japanese imperialism, and at the same time, there is no need to request reinforcements from the European part of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The weak foundation of the Japanese-Roman-Berlin axis is not mysterious. The conflict with the Soviet Union on the Siberian border last summer (referring to the Zhanggufeng Incident) clearly showed this. Japan launched this incident to encourage the activities of fascist countries in Europe, and at the same time hoped to receive enthusiastic assistance from Berlin and Rome. But the paper tiger was exposed. The Soviet Red Army not only showed verbally, but also in action, its willingness to resolutely fight. The result was a miserable failure for Japan. Japan miscalculated, believing that given the unstable world situation at the time, the Soviet Union would not accept the challenge on the Siberian border. This shameful failure also exposed the effectiveness of the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact: fascist countries can only help each other by threatening other countries, and cannot provide actual and effective assistance. At that time, Japanese reconnaissance planes reported the actions of the Red Army. The Red Army not only worked hard to advance its positions in the Zhanggufeng area, but also implemented advances towards the entire Manchurian border. At this time, Germany and Italy advised Japan to implement "localization of the border incident." The result is very obvious: Japan's "small war" against China has hindered the final plan for a "big war" against the Soviet Union. There is also another result, which should be known to the countries concerned in the Pacific region: Japan's aggression, whether due to orders from Tokyo or initiated by local military authorities, can be stopped by applying resolute and rapid retaliatory actions!</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Germany and Italy, Japan's belligerent friends, are leading diplomatic attacks and instigating "peace" with China. The peace they seek is the kind of peace that Czechoslovakia obtained last year. The result of "mediation" will inevitably produce victims under the Anti-Comintern Pact. The signatories to this pact can be divided into two categories: masters and stewards. The latter are the despicable "Manchukuo" government, General Franco, and any Chinese government that negotiates "peace" with Japan. Japan now desperately needs help to achieve peace, so as to rest from the endless and exhausting "victory." The wider Japan's "conquered" area, the more serious the problems of dealing with the Chinese regular army and guerrillas, and protecting transportation lines. The louder Japan's cries for international assistance and solidarity against the "communist threat!"</p>
<p>The Chinese puppet government under Japanese control has an important responsibility for maintaining the pretext of the "communist threat." Japan can use this puppet organization to call for peace, station troops in the "occupied" areas, and help "punishment units" attack "communists." The puppet government also has an important task: Japan can use it to create economic blockades and pass all laws and regulations that damage the trade and treaty interests of other countries; but Japan has not yet achieved this goal. Japan desperately needs peace to avoid collapse, so it has rejected the joint mediation of Britain and the United States. It is not surprising. England and the United States may be able to establish an international force to prevent Japan's hegemony on the mainland—no matter how small this force is—for this reason, Japan refutes that England and the United States have not recognized a new fact in the Far East, and believes that Germany is a "impartial" country that can persuade the Chinese government to seek peace with Japan to save itself from the scourge of communism.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some people in China have not expressed their willingness to make peace. On the contrary, the Chinese people unanimously and resolutely believe that true peace cannot be obtained until the Japanese aggressors are completely driven out of the country. China's mortal war for freedom is the only effective way to prevent Japan from infringing on the interests of the great powers in the Far East. The failure of Japan to attempt to conquer China is the only guarantee to prevent Japan from threatening other areas in the Far East and the Pacific! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Preparing for Conscription in Times of Emergency; Hong Kong Government Actively Preparing for National Registration; Exemptions to Registration to be Implemented After Regulations are Set; Funds Allocated to Organize Fire Brigade Volunteers to Cope with Emergency <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In order to ascertain the number of technical personnel for the purpose of conscription in times of emergency, the Hong Kong government previously promulgated the National Registration Ordinance. However, the date of implementation of the ordinance has not yet been determined. It is understood that the reason for the delay in determining the date of implementation is that the regulations for exemption from registration are still under consideration. At the same time, other preliminary implementation measures have not been finalized. However, the government is very actively preparing for the national registration, and it is believed that the announcement of the implementation date will not be far off. The National Registration Ordinance promulgated by the Hong Kong government is limited to British residents in Hong Kong, while Chinese and British-Chinese are not restricted. In addition, the Hong Kong Air Defense Authority has paid much attention and effort to the work of coping with emergencies. Recently, it has approved a first-phase budget of $11,000 to organize a fire brigade volunteer team, recruiting 50 members for a training period of four to five months, learning various firefighting techniques, and knowledge of extinguishing incendiary bombs. The recruitment of team members will begin soon and the team will be formally established. The Hong Kong emergency firefighting plan has been planned by the Fire Brigade and Air Defense Authority. All members of the Fire Brigade are now learning air defense knowledge to reduce the danger of air raids in Hong Kong and assist the public.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Flames of War Everywhere; Hong Kong's Spring Trade This Year is Weak; Export Trade is Half Suspended; Textiles, Piece Goods, and Rice Industry are All Depressed; Most Foreign Sundries Go Unnoticed <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>For Hong Kong Chinese merchants engaged in the export business, there is a so-called "Spring Trade" after the Lunar New Year every year. This trade is actually the largest part of the entire year's business. As a rule, this batch of orders has already been collected before the seventh day of the first month. In short, the annual business situation of Chinese export merchants in Hong Kong is determined by the amount of the spring trade in that year. This year, the situation of the Spring Trade of Chinese merchants in Hong Kong is a matter of social concern. This reporter spent several days investigating the actual situation of various industries, and now reports as follows:</p>
<p>Textiles: It should be said that the largest part of the Spring Trade of Chinese export merchants in Hong Kong is textiles and piece goods. In recent years, large and small textile factories have sprung up in Hong Kong, numbering in the hundreds. Except for a part of the products sold in Hong Kong, most of the rest are exported to Nanyang, Haiphong, and coastal ports. Some are also exported to the Dutch East Indies and mainland China. This year, Haikou was invaded by the enemy, and the delivery of goods was suspended. At the same time, textile factories in Shanghai have also resumed spinning, competing for business with Hong Kong factories in Haiphong and other places. Therefore, Hong Kong's Spring Trade has been affected to some extent. The factories in Hong Kong sometimes trade with the Philippine Islands, so the business is still very prosperous.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Industry: As for orders for piece goods, they are also affected by products from the occupied areas and enemy products. According to what this reporter knows, shops in Hong Kong, such as [indistinct] and [indistinct], have received many Spring Trade orders from various places, but the piece goods of these shops are completely transported from the enemy side to Hong Kong, impersonating domestic goods and dumping them in various places. The cost of enemy goods is lower, and the goods of Chinese merchants are attacked. Also, because Guangzhou has fallen, the piece goods in Hong Kong have lost one outlet. Those in Guangxi and other places no longer ship goods from Hong Kong. Currently, the piece goods shops in Hong Kong are still seeing customers like clouds, but large orders are rare. The future of sales is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Sundries Shops: The Spring Trade goods of sundries shops are also in a state of suspended animation. The trading in Haikou has completely stopped, and Fuzhou and Xiamen have long been ignored. Although there are orders from Shantou and other places, the number is not large. Among the sundries, such as rubber shoes, there is still some improvement. Other items, such as children's toys, leather balls, felt, felt hats, kettles, Western-style clothing supplies, etc., are almost unattended. It is estimated that among all export goods, the sundries industry is the most depressed.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Industry: As for the export of foreign rice, it is also very weak. Both the source and transportation are in a turbulent autumn. The environment is not constant. In the past, each ship arriving in Hong Kong from Annam would carry at least ten thousand bags, but the three Annam ships that recently arrived in Hong Kong carried only about six thousand bags. And this includes more than two thousand bags of miscellaneous grains. The actual number of white rice carried is only three thousand bags. If this continues in the future, the future of rice supply in Hong Kong can be seen. As for exports, because South China is in a military state, large exports are generally weak. In short, the Spring Trade of Chinese merchants in Hong Kong this year is in a state of semi-suspension. Although there are orders, the number is not large. Unless the situation in various places becomes stable, it will be difficult for Hong Kong's export business to improve.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Cargo Boat Robbed on Ma Chau Waters; All Twelve People in the Boat Were Driven Ashore; Both Boat and Goods Stolen, Loss Reaches Over a Thousand Dollars <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The waters near Hong Kong have always been frequented by pirates. The robbery of passing ships, and even the theft of ships, is often heard. Yesterday morning, the 24th, in the waters of Ma Chau, a Chinese territory close to the British border, another cargo boat was robbed, with a loss of several hundred dollars. It was found that the cargo boat, No. 1233, had been fully loaded with bamboo poles from Dongguan on the 23rd of this month and was coming to Hong Kong. At about 2 a.m. the next day (the 24th), when it reached the waters of Ma Chau, which is opposite Nantou in Baoan County, the sea was dark. The boatman Zhao De (52 years old) knew that the waters there were frequented by pirates, so even though it was dark and he could not tell the direction, he did not dare to stop. In addition to the bamboo poles, the boat also carried seven passengers and five boat companions, a total of twelve people. At that time, the passengers and two boat companions were already asleep. Only the boatman Zhao De and two companions were driving the boat. Suddenly, a small boat was seen speeding from the shore. There were five burly men on the boat, all between the ages of twenty and thirty, wearing black or gray cloth short shirts and pants, and one was holding a pistol. When the pirate boat approached, the men on the boat yelled, demanding that the cargo boat stop. The people in the cargo boat did not dare to disobey and were forced to stop. The pirates then drove the boat alongside the cargo boat, jumped onto the cargo boat, threatened everyone on the boat, and tied them up one by one. Then they drove the prisoners into the cabin. The pirates then searched everyone's belongings and drove the boat to a small island opposite [indistinct] , driving Zhao and the other eleven people ashore. Because the pirates were extremely fierce, Zhao and the others had no choice but to obey. The pirates then sped away with the boat, heading towards the Chinese waters. They had no choice but to walk back to Hong Kong. As they were walking slowly, they happened to meet another familiar cargo boat passing by, so they asked for help to take the individuals back to Hong Kong to report the case. The rest of the people have not yet been able to return to Hong Kong. The cargo boat is worth about six or seven hundred dollars, plus two hundred dollars worth of bamboo poles and clothing, for a total loss of over a thousand dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e43">First Prize in the Lottery is $250,000; Let's See Who Gets It Today; Derby Race Drawing Announced at 4 PM This Afternoon <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The holding of the Spring Derby Race has given a great stimulus to the general leisure class. According to the final cutoff yesterday, the Hong Kong Racecourse's one-dollar Derby lottery has sold up to 550,000 tickets. There is not much time left now. I am afraid that purchasing power will gradually weaken. Even if more tickets are sold, it will only be a little over ten thousand. The Derby Championship Lottery will be held again at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and the special lottery will also be drawn. It is estimated that the first prize can be obtained is 250,000 yuan, the second prize is about 66,000 yuan, and the third prize is about 33,000 yuan. There are a total of 29 qualifying ticket numbers, and each ticket can get about 3,000 yuan. This lively situation reminds people of ten years ago when the South China Athletic Association held the Derby Lottery every year, and the first prize was often around 300,000 yuan. Many changes have occurred in the middle of the situation. After at least seven or eight years, the magnificent number has not been heard. Now, it is gratifying that the grand event can be reproduced, but I don't know which lucky person will get this windfall. I would like to tell the readers here that if any of you are lucky enough to match the horse "Ni Huili" or "Nu Siyi Li", I dare to congratulate this person in advance, because it can be said that this person has almost won half of the first prize. According to everyone's observation, plus the results of last Saturday's race, it seems that there are only two horses in today's competition, namely "Ni Huili" and "Nu Siyi Li." The former ran one mile and two furlongs in the trial race, and the latter ran six furlongs in the maiden race. Dedicating his skills for the first time, he returned singing a triumphant song with a distance of more than one horse, which gave us a very good impression!</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese compatriots have enthusiastically contributed, consistently and tirelessly, greatly benefiting the future of the War of Resistance. The amount is by no means small. It is estimated that from July of the year before last to the end of June last year, donations have been successively remitted from overseas. According to the investigation, the amount received yesterday totaled 43,686,128.55 yuan in national currency. Regarding the regions of the donating overseas Chinese, Europe includes England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Turkey, Russia, Switzerland, and Sweden.

<h3 id="e46">Chinese Clerical Staff Association Held a Frugal Donation Ceremony Last Night, Achieving Remarkable Results <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, three amateur professional groups have emerged in Hong Kong with a new look. The Amateur Friendship Association includes professional members from all walks of life; the members of the Literary and Clerical Staff Association are mostly employees of foreign firms; and the Banking Amateur Friendship Association is purely for employees in the banking sector. Promoting proper entertainment and serving society and the country are their common goals.</p>
<p>Although there is a division into three groups on the surface due to the natural tendency of language and occupational background, in fact, they are three in one, sister groups with different paths but the same goal. The cadres of the three groups have close ties in spirit and take care of each other in their work, actively seeking common development.</p>
<p>This fact illustrates that as the motherland struggles on the line of life and death, the alert compatriots of Hong Kong are also moving away from the "licentiousness and shamelessness" and towards the "serious work" path.</p>
<p>This time, promoting a new way to celebrate the Lunar New Year, all three groups have made the greatest effort. What the reporter wants to report here is the news from the Chinese Clerical Staff Association:</p>
<p>Before the "New Year," the association distributed a large number of red envelopes with "Frugal Donation Envelopes" printed on them to its members, ten per person. The front cover was written with a mobilization slogan (Save on Unconscious Waste, Strengthen the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction). In addition to donating freely themselves, the association's more than 180 members should also distribute other donation envelopes to relatives and friends to donate as much as they can. It goes without saying that this influence is quite extensive.</p>
<p>At 7:30 last night, the association held a donation ceremony at its clubhouse. After the ceremony, Li Hanping gave an opening speech, followed by guest speeches, and Chen Shuangyu gave a reply speech. Next was the most exciting program. Enthusiastic members enthusiastically presented donation envelopes. Encouraged by the shouting, everyone was busy opening, counting, and registering the donation envelopes. The results were quite impressive. Finally, entertainment performances were held to celebrate, and everyone dispersed happily. The association's donation results last night were as follows: HK$313.59, national currency $40.50, fractional currency $9.40, Guangdong fractional currency $0.081. The largest individual donation that night was: staff of the shipping department of Jebsen &amp; Co., a total of HK$90, and Mr. Han Jincheng alone donated HK$10. It is heard that a small part of the donation envelopes has not yet been handed in, and the total amount will be calculated tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Chinese Night School Teachers' Association held a Reunion Meeting at Kong Saint Hall Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: The Hong Kong Vocational Night College is an educational institution under the management of the Hong Kong Education Bureau. The Chinese Teacher Training Department is an academic group for local primary and secondary school Chinese teachers to study. This organization has a history of over twenty years. Because it rarely interacts with the outside world, the public's perception of it is so vague. They themselves feel that there is considerable strength in this group and that it should be organized as much as possible to contribute to society, hence the organization of the Night School Alumni Association. In addition to the goals of general alumni associations, this organization also has a determination to serve social education. - This association has been established for more than ten months.</p>
<p>Yesterday (26th) at noon, they held their third reunion at the Kong Saint Hall in Caroline Hill. The meaning was to connect the feelings between classmates and students on the one hand; on the other hand, it was to sincerely hope to get guidance from outsiders. It was held grandly with the cooperation of classmates and teachers. More than 500 people attended, including the director of the school, Luo Renbo, as well as teachers, classmates, and guests.</p>
<p>The venue was decorated simply and solemnly. The Chinese and British flags were hung at the front door, and a dark blue curtain was hung on the stage, with the party's flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center. The ceremony began at one o'clock. Although filled with the joy of a reunion, they remotely expressed solemn and silent sympathy for the soldiers fighting in front and the compatriots in distress. The director of the school, Wei Renbo, personally gave instructions and described in detail the special educational environment of Hong Kong and the knowledge that educators in Hong Kong should have. Teacher Huang Guofang of the school also gave sincere encouragement to the association.</p>
<p>In order to not forget the War of Resistance during the reunion, a flower sale was held to respond to the One Dollar to Repay Debt movement. An immediate calculation showed a total of $21.40, which was decided to be handed over to this newspaper for transfer to the government.</p>
<p>The entertainment program included the drama "On the Front Line" performed by the Heming Drama Society, "The Roar of the Fugitive" and "Seeking Survival from Death" by the Whirlwind Drama Society; the chorus by the Life Choir, the solo of the South China Sea Situation by Huang Haizhi, the xylophone solo by Zhao Enrong and his son, and the dwarf song and dance. The entire audience had considerable tension. The song South China Sea Situation is the theme song of the film South China Sea Situation being directed by the famous director Cai Chusheng, expressing the charm and enthusiasm of the fishermen as much as possible. The performances of the dramas were all quite successful, especially the play "Seeking Survival from Death," which was most able to grasp the audience's psychology and attention.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Charity Sale and Amusement Fair <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>From morning, the sun did not show its face, and spring rain sprinkled sparsely. In this kind of distressing weather, people seemed to have nothing to do but doze off. At this time, perhaps the directors of the Charity Sale and Amusement Fair organized by the Hong Kong British Disaster Relief Association Fundraising Committee were deeply praying to heaven, asking the merciful master of all things to save a little rain and give more sunshine, otherwise, the charity sale and amusement fair that opened yesterday afternoon would probably be in trouble. Sure enough, perhaps the refugees still had some blessings, and in the afternoon, although there was still no sunshine, the drizzle suddenly stopped!</p>
<p>The main entrance of King's College had long been decorated as brightly as a brocade. It is said that the cost of decorating this grand facade was borne by the Hop Hing Peanut Oil Factory! The cost of other decorations inside the venue was also borne separately by enthusiastic people. All proceeds from the amusement and sale are donated to help refugees who are displaced, hungry, and cold. Before three o'clock, male and female guests had arrived in droves, making it very lively. The male and female staff who entertained the guests were all very busy.</p>
<p>At 3:00 pm, the opening ceremony of the sale and amusement fair was held. The hall of King's College was really crowded with people, packed like sardines. First, Chairman Lei Yincong gave an opening speech, followed by Lu Yun reporting on the preparations, Ye Lan thanking the businesses for donating goods; finally, Luo Xuxue and Sir delivered speeches. People standing further away were probably not able to know what the people on the stage were saying, but even if they couldn't hear it, they would probably guess eight or nine tenths of it. What they said was nothing more than those words that encouraged our audience to do more good deeds.</p>
<p>When it came time to cut the ribbon to open the amusement and sale, Sir Luo Xuxue was about to cut the ribbon, but unexpectedly, the person in charge was negligent and forgot that scissors were needed to cut the ribbon, which made Sir Luo wait for more than ten minutes before finding the scissors. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the guests poured down from the upstairs, and the amusement area and the sale area immediately became active.</p>
<p>The venue was arranged with the sale area on the right and the amusement area on the left, and the tea room further in. Upstairs in the sale area was the singing area. The sale area displayed various factory products, in various styles, beautiful and dazzling, which really made the viewers reluctant to let go, and the prices were low, all sold at market prices, so shopping was very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The amusement programs were all meaningful and fun, such as "Beating Traitors" which made people laugh. Other games such as fishing, spinning wheel prizes, shooting, etc., were also thought-provoking. In addition, there were also Feiqiu, throwing airplanes, flying needles, hitting pool, adding number awards, trying strength awards, flying ring copper buckles, shooting raw fruits, flying immortals into plates, five-color ball throwing, cycling competitions, green butterflies into place, hitting big dice, rubber gun balloons, final victory, aviation salvation, throwing sand tube rubber bead human caves, etc., a total of twenty west items. Each item was listed on an amusement table, all of which were amusement in nature. At the cost of one hao, you could get items whose value was several times the price.</p>
<p>The first to patronize the amusement park was Lawyer Luo Wenxin. He "hit the traitor" many times, and finally hit the "female traitor" and won a prize; however, Lawyer Luo did not care about what prizes he won, it seemed that he was just doing his best. I think, if there were more enthusiastic people who did not care, the harvest of the amusement part would be better. Remotely opposite the "Hitting Traitors" section was "XXX", and the number of people patronizing these two sections was more than other sections, which shows how enthusiastic the people were, and how they wanted to eat the flesh and sleep on the skin of the traitors. According to one "Hitting Traitor" player, beating the traitor this time was much more enjoyable than beating Qin Hui and his wife at Yue Wang's tomb in West Lake a few years ago. Now, the spring outing ladies of West Lake are probably gone, which is cheaper for Qin Hui, the ancestor of the traitor. The slogans in the venue were also very eye-catching and powerful, such as "Those who grow wealth should be able to provide relief, otherwise it is just wealth," "Foreigners are still helping our compatriots in distress, what should our people do?" I believe that many people will be unhappy or ashamed after seeing such slogans!</p>
<p>The fair will last for two more days, and I would like to plead on behalf of the countless compatriots in distress here. Overseas Chinese, please be kind and generous, and come to the occasion that combines entertainment and relief to give these compatriots in distress as much help as you can! Come on! This charity sale and amusement fair will satisfy you. (New)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Japanese Troops Anxiously Attempt to Occupy the Entire Island, Japanese Warships Gather Off the Coast of Southern Guangdong, Approximately Seventy Japanese Warships Assembled Near the Qiongzhou Strait, Our Garrison Soldiers Vow Not to Retreat an Inch of Land Easily <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Fast News from the South Road] It has been more than ten days since the Japanese army launched a military operation to invade Hainan Island. After our soldiers and civilians fought bravely separately, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. This severely hampered the Japanese ambition to occupy the entire island as expected, forcing them to exhaust all resources and transfer troops from Taiwan, Xiamen, Tuandao Island, and other places to provide reinforcements. Therefore, in recent days, Japanese warships have been frequently traveling to and from the coast of southern Guangdong, and the transportation of military supplies has been particularly busy. According to information received by a certain agency yesterday, there are approximately forty Japanese warships assembled off the coast of southern Guangdong, most of which are concentrated in the Qiongzhou Strait. In addition, there are more than ten ships in Dongchang, Jianjiao, and Hai'an ports belonging to Xuwen County. Near Haikou, Qiongzhou, there are two giant engineering ships, five battleships, three submarines, eight transport ships converted from merchant ships, and seven or eight gunboats. In addition, they patrol the coastal ports to spy. The military equipment, food, and supplies that have been transported in recent days are all unloaded at Haikou and forced our fishing boats to transport them to Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Ding'an to provide for the Japanese troops in those areas for continued invasion.</p>
<p>It is also reported that our brave soldiers guarding Qiongya have made a great determination to defend Qiongya. They will never easily retreat even an inch of land. Therefore, under the command of Commander Wang Yi and Commander Yang Yongren, they have been fighting bravely. Many Japanese soldiers have been killed in the Jiaji and Lingshui areas. In addition, the Japanese army rapes, loots, and kills everywhere, and the people are filled with hatred for the Japanese atrocities. They vow to avenge their hometown and have joined the guerrillas to participate in the War of Resistance. Their strength is increasing day by day. The difficulties the Japanese will encounter in the future will be even greater. The Japanese dream of penetrating deep into the interior and occupying the entire Qiong in a short period of time will be difficult to realize.</p>

<p>[Fast News from Shenzhen] After the Japanese troops in the Dongjiang Shilong, Shitan, Taiping, and Wancheng strongholds were reinforced, in the past week, the Japanese troops on the Wan Tai, Wan Long, and Guanghu highways have been busy transporting food and military supplies. The Japanese troops in each stronghold have expanded the outer defense line and built fortifications, as if preparing for the arrival of a major war. Therefore, the situation in Dongjiang is gradually becoming tense, and at the same time, traitors are unusually rampant.</p>

<p>[Fast News from Dongguan] On the 19th of this month, more than 3,000 Japanese troops opened Zengcheng from Guangzhou, and the Japanese troops in Zengcheng immediately advanced to the Shilong and Shitan area. On the 21st and 22nd, more than 400 Japanese infantrymen, with 12 small steel cannons, advanced south along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Shilong. On the 23rd, they arrived near Zhangmutou Station and immediately occupied various key points, claiming to check the household registration of each village and ordering the gentry to hand over the guerrillas. Zhangmutou is only composed of two villages inhabited by Yuan and Luo clans, in addition to the highway station and small market. The Japanese feared that our Huizhou teams would advance and lurk here, threatening the middle section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, they sent half of the Japanese troops to advance east along the Huizhang Highway to deploy defenses near Shima to prevent our Huizhou teams from attacking. The rest set fire in separate groups in Zhangmutou Station and the Yuan and Luo villages, prohibiting rescue. At one time, the fire was raging, spreading in separate groups, and the residents fled in succession, their cries shaking the sky. The situation was terrible. The fire continued to burn until the 24th and had not been extinguished. The houses and huts in the station area of the station highway and the Yuan and Luo villages were all burned to the ground, and many residents died of cold and starvation on the road. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Japanese troops in Shima began to withdraw and returned to deploy defenses near Zhangmutou Station to prevent our Huizhou troops from tracking them down.</p>

<p>[Fast News from Shaoguan] Since the War of Resistance, local authorities in Guangdong Province have levied various War of Resistance fees and security fees in order to maintain the team's salaries and supplies. Since Li Hanhun took office as the chairman of Guangdong Province, he has made it his responsibility to relieve the people's suffering and rectify official corruption. He has received many complaints from merchants and people about the collection of War of Resistance fees in various counties, requesting that strict prohibition be implemented to comply with government instructions and the decree that local officials are not allowed to levy any donations. Chairman Li has also sent personnel to various counties to investigate, and it has been confirmed that the collection is true. He has ordered the commanders of the guerrilla zones and the magistrates of the counties to immediately abolish the War of Resistance fees to reduce the burden on the people and benefit the traveling passengers and goods. It has recently been found that the counties that control the transportation channels have abolished the War of Resistance fees, but the fees were originally collected from the passengers and goods' fares by various ferries. However, since the abolition, the ferries have not deducted the fees and are still charging as usual. Chairman Li has heard about this matter and yesterday ordered the commanders of the guerrilla zones and the magistrates of the counties to instruct the shipping companies to immediately reduce and exempt the War of Resistance fees in the passenger fares, and not to collect any fees on behalf of local officials. If anyone still collects War of Resistance fees from passengers and secretly sends them to local officials, they will be severely punished.</p>

<p>[Fast News from Jiaji] Since the Japanese launched the landing at Haikou on the 10th of this month, they have divided their troops to occupy Qiongshan and advanced into the inland areas of Chengmai and Ding'an. Another warship was sent to cover the Japanese troops to land and invade the counties of Yaxian, Lingshui, and Qiongdong from Zhaohai. However, the Japanese troops landing in various places have been met with strong resistance, and there has been no progress so far. The Japanese troops who invaded Jiaji, Lingshui, and Chengmai have also been repeatedly annihilated by our army, suffering heavy casualties, and have been unable to make contact with other landing Japanese troops. However, the Japanese army's conspiracy to wipe out our team has not been reduced in the slightest. In recent times, they have been desperately advancing, so fierce blood battles have been fought between Jiaji, Ding'an, and Wenchang in recent days.</p>

<p>[Communication from Guangzhou Bay] According to fishermen who escaped from Wenchang County, the order was chaotic when the Japanese captured Haikou, and the military discipline was corrupted. The local women suffered miserably. Hundreds of women who were robbed were imprisoned in one place in Haikou's Five-Story Building and were all brutally violated. Also, when Qiongshan County fell, more than 150 young people in Qiongshan were unable to escape and were all massacred. Before Wenchang County fell, the county middle school was completely bombed by the Japanese planes. The principal, Zhan Hangrui, was injured in the foot by the bombing. The school is located in an open space in the suburbs and occupies a large area. The Japanese's purpose is clearly to destroy our cultural institutions, which is extremely cruel.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Bai Wei</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the × army from Huibo on October 9th of last year, the military situation in Dongjiang has experienced a relatively long period of silence. In fact, this is due to the × people deeply feeling that their forces are insufficient and having to tighten their defense lines. At the same time, it is also due to the magnificent posture of our counter-offensive and the threat of the people's guerrilla forces. It can control Chaozhou and Meizhou in the upper reaches, defend Guangzhou in the lower reaches, and connect the coast of Daya Bay on the side. In terms of geographical situation, Huizhou—including Huibo, Hezi, Hailu, and other counties—still retains its considerable military value. Therefore, this retreat of the × people was not voluntary, but due to insufficient strength.</p>
<p>Because of this, the × people naturally did not give up their attempt to occupy the area. However, in order to save troops, they changed their form. The Lufeng riot led by the × people at the end of last month was a change of military strategy, adopting political means instead. By February of this year, they felt that the people of Dongjiang were highly agitated and the political conspiracy had completely failed. They then changed their military strategy back to military harassment. The battle of Lianhe Market in the early days and the current battles of Longhua and Changning are examples. In fact, this kind of military harassment by the × people is not only fruitless, but also allows us to complete our attrition and attraction strategy. In particular, it provides our armed peasants with more opportunities to show their skills.</p>
<p>Regarding the battles of Lianhe, Longhua, and Weining, the reporter happened to meet Mr. Xiao Jianxiong, the secretary representing the Boluo County Government, who came to Huizhou to report this afternoon. Combined with information from the Dongjiang Detachment Headquarters, the details of the process are quite clear.</p>
<p>The motives of the × people's repeated harassment all contain the effect of a smokescreen. First, to disrupt our sight and contain the military strength of our Dongjiang forces. Second, to attack as a defense and prevent our offensive. Therefore, when the Lianhe Market was attacked, one or two × ships appeared in Daya Bay, and one or two × aircraft appeared in the sky above Dongjiang. They did not land or drop bombs, proving that it was a coordinated overall plan. As for the intrusion of Longhua and Changning this time, most of it seems to be to cover and coordinate the attack on Hainan Island. The second reason is a means of retaliation for the loss at Lianhe. According to Secretary Xiao's report, in the Battle of Lianhe, six of our people were killed or wounded, but the enemy was killed 52 people, (43 stationed in Shiwang, 5 in Shilong, and 4 in Zengcheng). In the hearts of the × people, what a huge difference.</p>
<p>In view of the lesson of Lianhe, the team that the × people attacked this time amounted to more than 3,000 people. They advanced in two routes. On the afternoon of the 8th, one route of infantry and artillery, more than 1,000 strong, and 300 cavalry came from Shilong via the Jinglan and Masi trails, with the destination being the Longhua area. Another route consisted of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, totaling more than 2,000, with multiple aircraft, coming from Zengcheng, with the destination being the foot of Mount Luofu.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 9th, the × people from Shilong had crossed Baijiao Township and arrived at Longhua. The detachment stationed in Longhua, led by Bu Zhiyang, rose up to resist together with the armed villagers. Although the × aircraft covering the advance continued to bomb, and the × people's mountain artillery continued to bombard, they did not retreat. Relying on the shelter of the houses in the market, they fired at the × people. It was not until the houses on the outer perimeter of the market were almost destroyed that they retreated into the nearby hills. After retreating into the hills, they still hid in the forests, using their Mauser rifles and local rifles to continue to counterattack the × people. This heroic posture is rarely seen. Therefore, the × people entered Longhua and set fire to vent their anger, not daring to stay for long. At 1:00 p.m., they returned to Zhufan, and on the 10th, they returned to Shilong. Along the way, in the villages and townships they passed, Shangcun, Hexu, and Xiacun, the × people burned and killed as they went. Our armed peasants also attacked whenever they encountered them. Due to the peasants' fearless efforts, although our sacrifices were quite large, with nearly 100 casualties, it is expected that the number of × people intercepted by us was not far off. A local rifle, a broadsword, defeated the × people's planes and artillery. The brave peasants and detachment members are eternally worthy of praise. Unexpectedly, this small town actually extinguished the fierce flames of the × people.</p>
<p>The × people from Zengcheng also launched a large-scale attack at the same time, passing through the Fu, Tian, Changning, and Dongping markets in the Fourth District of Boluo, and scurrying to Mount Luofu. The detachment Lin Junsheng's department had already made a frontal resistance, and a fierce bayonet fight broke out. In the end, feeling the disparity in numbers, they led the team to retreat into the Luofu Mountains and the Lan River to carry out guerrilla side attacks. When the × people were advancing along the Luofu Mountain Highway, we were on the mountain of Baiheguan, (rows of light machine gun bullets, swept down like a string of beads, it can already be known how many × people were stained with blood on that road, and when the × people's large team chased after them, we climbed over another mountain, and swept down in the same way, and saw the × people falling one by one, Luofu Mountain can truly be said to be the grave of the × people. Unfortunately, the × people tried desperately to cover up and transport back the bodies of those killed, otherwise, not only would the highway be stained with blood, but there would also be ready-made souvenirs. Team leader Lin Junsheng just arrived in Huizhou to report yesterday. From the tone of his report, the reporter was able to understand how happy and excited he was in this battle. Due to the strange losses, the × people extended their team to Lanshi, and did not dare to miss or prolong the time any longer, and immediately fled back to Zengcheng on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>
<p>If the × people want to calculate what they gained from this operation, I am afraid there is only one thing—burning our villages. Burning is the × people's specialty. From Masi to Longhua, from Futian to Lanshi, although there has been no detailed investigation, it is estimated that about 2,000 houses were burned in total. However, he set fire to the homes of farmers, how is it different from setting fire in the hearts of the farmers, watching our brave and strong farmers, calculate the fire account for their homes and the × people. At the same time, we must widely launch a consolation and relief movement to help these homeless and helpless comrades.</p>
<p>Now the conspiracy of the × people has obviously failed. The team of the × people has retreated to Zengcheng and Shilong, and our team, including the armed masses, is following them to Zengcheng, closely entangled, and launching multifaceted attacks. The Dongjiang Guerrilla team fully implements the basic guerrilla tactics of "I resist when the × people come, and I harass when the × people retreat," so that the × people have no possibility of breathing or taking the initiative. This will make the × people in Dongjiang suffer, weaken, and perish.</p>

<h3 id="e59">From Shantou to Saigon (Continued) <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Hua You</p>
<p>When I took the jade ring, I felt a little happy. I was about to step back when the tiger-bully said to Mr. Zhang, "I'm a little unhappy with him." As he spoke, he glared at me. When Mr. Zhang asked him why, he said that I shouldn't make a big deal out of it. There are "Mazin" from Chaozhou, Fujian, Hainan, and Hakka here. If I didn't want to give it to him, I could have just stated it. Why did I have to report it to the consulate? I said to Mr. Zhang, if I hadn't done this, I wouldn't have been able to get the meat out of the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>After returning to the hotel, the Yong'an boss and other guests were all very happy. They said that my victory in this negotiation was the first time ever. Generally, when overseas Chinese come here, they take away a lot of things from them. No one has ever negotiated with them.</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, Saigon customs officials did not take things as much as they do now. The reason why the French are so unscrupulous is as follows:</p>
<p>A Mazin Neglect of Duty—The "Mazin" used in the Qifu Clothing Box Pavilion cannot fulfill their duties. They turn a deaf ear to any difficulties of the overseas Chinese. Not only do they not help you, but sometimes they collude with those customs officers to exploit the overseas Chinese. Recently, the Consulate in Saigon plans to send personnel to the Clothing Box Pavilion to help the overseas Chinese. I don't know if it has been implemented. I think that if the consulate can implement the above plan, the benefits to the overseas Chinese cannot be counted in numbers. If the consulate can send personnel to supervise, those customs officers will naturally not dare to take things from our overseas Chinese arbitrarily. Any difficulties can also be negotiated with him face to face. In fact, at that time, I believe there will be nothing to negotiate, because since we have officials there to supervise, I believe they will be quite polite, because the friendly relations between China and France are very friendly at present.</p>
<p>B Lack of Group Organization—The biggest defect of overseas Chinese in general is that they are too selfish. When they go to Nanyang, they only seek to make money. As long as there is money to be made, they can endure any anger. People catch your weaknesses and naturally do whatever they want. According to the estimation of overseas Chinese, every time a ship docks in Saigon, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese are always in the thousands. This is a huge amount of money accumulated over the years. My meaning is that the persons in charge of Qifu should find a way to make up for this leak. The easiest way is to hire a few more full-time legal advisors. If those customs officers arbitrarily rob the things of the overseas Chinese, they should refute them with reason. Our overseas Chinese luggage, they should handle it according to the regulations. There is absolutely no reason to forcibly seize people's things and take them for themselves.</p>
<p>C Afraid of Trouble—After the author recovered the jade ring, Deputy Consul Zhuo protested to the local tax office. According to the opinion of the tax office, as long as evidence can be collected, they will definitely strictly investigate and deal with it. Therefore, Deputy Consul Zhuo entrusted me to collect some evidence on their behalf, but it took a lot of effort to submit the evidence. They all hid "deeply" for fear that if they came forward, if they needed to testify in court in the future, they were afraid that there would be some problems with their residence. In short, the educational level of overseas Chinese in general is too pitiful. They are mostly unable to distinguish right from wrong for all events. Even if they understand right and wrong, they lack the strength to do anything. So, they can only listen to others and let them slaughter them.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of overseas Chinese in general and the losses suffered have been described above. It is not impossible to remedy these losses. In my humble opinion, as long as the staff of the Consulate in Saigon make use of the current friendly relations between China and France, and further, according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit in the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty signed in Nanjing the year before last (?), request the French colonial government to improve the treatment, I believe it can be done.</p>
<p>A Regarding the opinion that luggage cannot be carried with you when going ashore, the most painful thing that overseas Chinese feel when going to Saigon is that they have no quilts and no clothes to change. Although Annam is located in the tropics, when it encounters the rainy season...the sixth, seventh, and eighth months of the lunar calendar are the months with the most rainfall in Annam, and the climate is cool enough. When night falls, you have to cover yourself with a blanket. We are not allowed to bring even a blanket with us when we go ashore. In this way, when we arrive at the inn, we have to let the cold air bully us (the nature of inns and hotels are different. Hotels have bedding, while inns have nothing except a bed and a wooden pillow). It is a torture not to have a quilt, and it is also a torture not to have clothes to change, not to mention that since disembarking from Shantou, I have not taken a bath—the Pacific third ship, except for the official cabin equipment with bathrooms, there are no bathrooms in the large cabin. In this way, you can only endure until you get ashore, but it is even more painful not to have clothes to change after you get ashore. This is what almost every overseas Chinese thinks is the most painful thing. Therefore, when the ship enters Saigon Port, everyone wears one or two more clothes, (some even wear six or seven pieces. These are generally unconscious women who want to avoid paying taxes, but in the end, they are embarrassed on the spot—they are seen by the customs inspectors). In order to prepare to change clothes when going ashore, the French customs officers think they are trying to evade taxes. I have personally seen a few overseas Chinese wearing two casual shirts (one gauze shirt to pay taxes, and even if they only wear a new gauze shirt, they will be stripped off to pay taxes [To be continued]</p>

<h3 id="e61">Yesterday's Football Charity Match: Hong Kong Combined Team Forced a Draw with South China, 1-1, the Whole Performance Was Understated <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday's charity football match at Jia Shan was an understated performance throughout. While sometimes exciting, it also felt ordinary; while sometimes relaxed, it occasionally had moments of tension. In short, this meeting between the two teams was for the sake of disaster victims, with no championship issues at stake. Therefore, the performance aspect outweighed the competitive spirit. Everyone's actions were based on skill, and the match was still pleasing and watchable. The general public also felt their trip was worthwhile, and they donated generously, feeling at peace.</p>
<p>In the morning, there was light drizzle and the weather was dull. The weather cleared up in the afternoon, ensuring the match wasn't affected. Both teams arrived on time, and there were three to four thousand spectators, making the scene quite lively. However, this time, the number of spectators was slightly less than the previous charity matches Li Huitang participated in this year. The reasons for this seem to be due to the following three factors: (1) There have been too many matches recently, and the fans are tired of watching; this is inevitable. (2) From the inter-port trials to the official matches, Huitang has appeared several times, connecting with the fans. Unlike before, when he only appeared after much anticipation, the general longing has turned into a sense of normalcy due to his frequent appearances. (3) The rain yesterday morning suppressed the fans' enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Neither side fielded their originally selected lineup for this match. For South China, Tan Zhenhui replaced Liu Weipei, and Luo Dou replaced Liu Songsheng. However, the overall strength was not diminished at all. For the Hong Kong Combined Team, Gao Shannu was nowhere to be seen. The spectators assumed he wouldn't appear, and had a pessimistic view of the Hong Kong Combined Team's forward line. Mo Shi replaced him as center forward. Shu Shi was also absent, so reserve Li Dishi played left forward, and the unnamed Tan Mashi, who was temporarily invited to play, played left wing. Therefore, at the start of the match, everyone thought South China would win by a large margin. Just comparing the forward lines of the two teams, South China's five tigers were so formidable that even if the Hong Kong Combined Team's defenders weren't scared away, they would be beaten away and unable to withstand their threat. However, despite what people thought, the result after seventy minutes of competition was a 1-1 draw. Moreover, South China's goal was clearly scored when Huitang was offside, but because the referee didn't see it clearly, Huitang was given an unexpected goal. Therefore, although the score was a draw, South China was actually defeated.</p>
<p>This match was for performance purposes, so there's no need to overemphasize the win-loss issue. In terms of strength, South China was indeed stronger and often had the advantage, but in the end, they couldn't find a way to win. They only scored an accidental and offside goal. Was this because South China's forward line was weak, or because the Hong Kong Combined Team's defense was strong? In my opinion, the biggest reason was that Huitang was closely marked by Biludu, who didn't allow him to move freely. Biludu was originally a very good center forward who liked to dribble and attack, but yesterday he changed his style and adopted the third inner defender method, sticking to Huitang like glue. Sometimes, Hou Rongsheng or Shi Han also helped, combining the strength of several people to block Huitang. Therefore, Huitang's central attacks couldn't be unleashed in this match. Throughout the game, he only had two chances to shoot in the first half. Also, because it was a charity match, he wasn't fixated on winning and didn't change his strategy. (In the previous match between the Chinese Combined Team and the Philippine team, he used a retreating strategy, luring the opponent's center back out, and then attacking from the flanks, which achieved remarkable results.) This showed his casual approach. Sun Lai, Mai Shaohan, and Tan Mashi were injured in collisions and had to leave the field. He then retreated from the forward line to the back line to fill the gap left by Shaohan, changing from attack to defense. The general public saw this and talked about it. As far as I know, many years ago, the Shanghai Lehua team toured Hong Kong and put on exhibition matches. At that time, Huitang was still in the Lehua team and played inner defender, performing very well. However, he had never played that position again after returning to Hong Kong. Yesterday, he occasionally played that role, which felt a bit awkward. However, his ability to adapt and retreat showed that he was not someone who had been in the army for nothing.</p>
<p>Some people said that this match was the least exciting charity match ever. However, the outstanding performance of the two goalkeepers is worth praising. Zhang Rongcai's skills are indeed extraordinary. He pounced and jumped at crucial moments to save the ball from danger. His agility and stability in avoiding collisions and saving balls are far superior to ordinary goalkeepers who blindly kick the ball out. This is a great help to the offensive side. Heli still made twisting and diving saves, so Zhao Rong's several quick shots were ineffective. He is also tall and has long arms, and is not afraid of charges. As for the one goal he conceded, he certainly felt it shouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Combined Team's forward line performed well. Mo Shi, the center forward, was fierce and had powerful shots, threatening South China quite a bit. The two wings also had good moments. On the defense, because Biludu was focused on marking Huitang and didn't dare to attack, they were able to consolidate their defense and ultimately remain undefeated. I believe that Biludu deserves the most credit for the Hong Kong Combined Team's ability to avoid conceding more goals.</p>
<p>Because the South China players focused on skillful performances, their passing and dribbling were precise. However, because there was too much passing and dribbling, they often competed in midfield, resulting in a situation of mutual contention.</p>
<p>After discussing the football, let's talk about the match situation. The lineups of the two teams during the match were as follows:</p>
<p>[South China Club]</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Tan Zhenhui Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai</p>
<p>Luo Douwen Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>[Hong Kong Combined Team]</p>
<p>Heli</p>
<p>Shi Han Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Xu Cheng Biludu Ni Bolu</p>
<p>Tan Mashi Li Dishi Mo Shi Ni Anbachen</p>
<p>When the time came, the god of war arrived, and the two armies began to fight fiercely. Huitang took the lead, with Zhaorong and Jingxiang dividing their forces to assist the attack. The Hong Kong Combined Team's midfielders saw this and met them with a three-pronged attack. After a few rounds, Huitang and others led their troops back. Anbachen stole through the defense and cut the ball in. Dishi fired in the middle, and Rongcai stepped forward to save it, very well done.</p>
<p>Douwen and Zhaorong joined forces, but were blocked by Hanni Bolu and couldn't advance further. On the other side, Tan Mashi launched a rebellion at the border gate, cutting in perfectly. Mo Shi rushed forward to shoot, but Rongcai dived to save it, another great play. Although the Hong Kong Combined Team got a corner kick, they retreated without any advantage. Rongzhao, Zhenhui, and Caicai, three heroes, covered the forward army and pushed forward. Indeed, Huitang broke through the barrier and entered. Douwen responded and forced a corner kick. The bottom line came open, and Zhaorong shot fiercely, but Heli saved it well, turning danger into safety.</p>
<p>Dishi stole into the encirclement and fired a cold arrow. Mo Shi fired in succession, with a strong momentum. Fortunately, Rongcai had quick eyes and hands, and was not caught off guard. Then, Lishi attacked again, but Tiansheng calmly saved it. Dou Tian then waved his troops forward, crossing into Rongsheng's position and shooting fiercely. He hit Heli's body, failing to achieve his goal, which was a great pity. However, South China did not lose heart because of this. Rongzhao escorted, and Huitang rushed forward to seek victory. The cannonball was fired, but unfortunately landed outside the field. Zhaorong returned and the Hong Kong Combined Team's defenders saw his menacing momentum and prepared in earnest. Zhaorong rushed into the encirclement and shot at the goal, hitting the goalpost and bouncing out. Guangsen spurred his horse to catch up and added a foot, but again missed, losing a good opportunity.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Combined Team's crisis had passed, and Anbachen was determined to counterattack, but his shot was inaccurate and ineffective. Jingxiang advanced on the right, and Douwen responded from the side. He got the ball and shot fiercely, but was rejected by Heli out of bounds. Guangsen opened the corner kick, but still didn't gain any advantage. Then Huitang, Douwen, Jingxiang, and Zhaorong's coalition forces rushed in, like an overwhelming force. Heli stood forward and tried to stop them, and Shi Han and Rongsheng came out to resist, managing to reverse the dangerous situation. The first half ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Switching sides to fight again, South China went all out. Guangsen approached the Hong Kong Combined Team's position, but was entangled by Shi Han and was finally defeated. Biludu became the protector of the forward army, rushing into South China's key area. Mo Shi rushed forward to respond, but fortunately Rongcai calmly dealt with it, turning swords into ploughshares.</p>
<p>Huitang advanced in the middle, receiving a pass from Guangsen. He kicked up and headed the ball out of bounds, which looked pretty good. After a while, Dou Tian passed the ball to Huitang again, who crossed Hanni Bolu. Rongsheng didn't know the direction, and Heli only wanted to save it, but Huitang's kick was already up, and the ball went into the net. Heli could only sigh as he watched the ball. Huitang was originally offside, but the referee didn't see it clearly, so he got this unexpected gain.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Combined Team first conceded a goal, and was determined to counterattack. Tan Mashi forced a corner kick, but didn't achieve anything. Guangsen raised his troops again, and Heli came out to intercept. Douwen rushed to catch it, but was too hasty and shot out of bounds.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhaohan was injured in a brave battle and left the field, leaving only ten people to fight. Huitang was afraid of losing the rear, so he retreated to the rear army and guarded the inner guard. Unexpectedly, Tan Mashi secretly crossed the border and cut in front of the goal. Lishi rushed forward desperately and kicked the door. Rongcai slapped the ball out, but was intercepted by Haobachen, who passed it back lightly. Garni arrived and kicked it in, reversing the defeat. After that, both sides made progress, but neither side had a chance to win again. At the end of the game, the score was 1-1, and the spring colors were divided equally, and the army was withdrawn down the mountain.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Swimming Tent at Repulse Bay: Government Has Not Yet Made a Decision to Prohibit Them <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Repulse Bay in Hong Kong is a great place to escape the summer heat. Every summer, many residents build tents on the beach for recreation. However, it has recently been rumored that the government will prohibit the construction of tents at Repulse Bay this summer, which has caused concern among those who like to swim there. According to the Director of Public Works, Henderson, the issue of beach tents is under consideration, including whether to allow the construction of tents on the beach there. The committee has not yet reached a conclusion, and it is difficult to predict what its recommendations will be in the future. However, as of now, there is no decision to prohibit the construction of private tents.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Open Men's Basketball Tournament: Registration Deadline Tomorrow, Reporter Team Prepares to Register and Participate <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the Hong Kong Basketball Association started accepting registrations for the Men's Open Basketball Tournament, various teams have enthusiastically participated. It has been verified that the teams that have already registered include Pei Yang A and B teams, Indian Police B team, Sing Tao A team, Hong Yuan A and B teams, and the Eastern team. The Zhong Sheng and Li Xing teams have also decided to join, but have not formally registered. Now that the league believes the start date is approaching, it has decided to close registration on the 28th of this month, and will not extend the period. If any teams have not yet registered to join, they can fill out the registration form at the Sing Tao Business Department within a short period of time. Once registration is closed, a representative meeting will be convened, and the opening game can be held around the 10th of next month. Also, the Hong Kong newspaper reporters have a basketball team organization. Last year, they participated in the open tournament and won all seven games, achieving excellent results. When the Sports Special Committee of the Reporters Association was established to manage all sports matters for reporters, the reporter basketball team respected the association's special committee and the members of each team agreed to cancel the team's name. In order to expand their strength, it will be organized by the Sports Special Committee. Now the Sports Special Committee has many good basketball players among its members, and has specially appointed Mao Ziming as the basketball team leader, and Xiao Dianlian and Xu Heng as instructors to take charge of the matter. The Sports Special Committee has been re-elected as a member of the Basketball Association, and as the open tournament will start soon, it has decided to send a team to participate in order to get more opportunities to learn from outside teams. Therefore, starting today, training will begin. At 3 pm, gather at No. 10 Puqingfang, the second school building of Fanglin Middle School, to change clothes, and review the strength on the Xia Park basketball court. If any members who are interested in this sport and want to represent the team, must notify Li Zhiming, the director of the organizing department of the Sports Special Committee (Circulation Daily Editorial Department) no later than 8 pm tonight, otherwise they will be missed when the quota is full. Also, the following gentlemen, please be sure to come to the venue today: Hu Hao, Ma Zhaohua, Liu Xiwena, Liang Zhuchang, Huang Seming, Cheng Baoqi, Liu Bingwei, Lu Yenong, Tang Muran, Pan Zhuoyu, Shao Weixin, Mo Jianyao, Luo Ciqing.</p>
<h3 id="e64">First Division Football League: Navy Wins Big, Defeating St. Joseph's 6-2 <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Navy football team played a First Division league match against St. Joseph's at the Causeway Bay stadium yesterday afternoon. The Navy is a strong team with the highest hopes of winning the championship, with plenty of talent. In addition, they were eliminated by St. Joseph's in the special silver shield semi-final the other day, leaving them with endless regrets. Therefore, yesterday they came to the league match with their spirits up, determined to win. St. Joseph's, on the other hand, had Gao Shannu absent and Biludu playing for the Hong Kong Combined Team in a charity match, lacking two major players and their strength was slightly reduced. Therefore, in the battle against the Navy, they admitted that they were inferior and were defeated by a large margin of 2-6. Now that the Navy has won another game, their score is even higher.</p>

<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>In recent days, the newspapers here have published two such news items:</p>
<p>The former principal of a provincial girls' middle school, ××, did not make a clear account. The school donations collected by him were not accounted for at all. After questioning by the current principal, he also gave ambiguous answers in the newspapers, causing dissatisfaction in the local public opinion.</p>
<p>When the former principal of a county middle school, Yang ××, handed over his duties, he only handed over two national currency to the new principal. After the new principal's thorough investigation, he learned that the former administration was extremely corrupt, and that hundreds of yuan of student deposits and student union donation deposits were also unaccounted for. The students of the school were shocked when they heard the news.</p>
<p>These two news items are of the same type: vaguely speaking, "the account is unclear," and frankly speaking, it is "embezzlement of public funds."</p>
<p>The protagonists of these two news items are also sacred middle school principals.</p>
<p>This makes me unable to avoid feeling a little "something inside."</p>
<p>The purpose of secondary school education is to emphasize the following two points:</p>
<p>a. Laying the foundation for various basic knowledge,</p>
<p>b. Cultivating the character of young people.</p>
<p>Neglecting a is certainly not acceptable, and neglecting b is even more unacceptable. This is naturally very clear. For example, we often say: young people are like a piece of white cloth, which turns red when thrown into a red dye vat, and turns black when thrown into a black dye vat. This means that young people have no opinions of their own. If those who are weak-willed are not properly guided onto the right path, they will rush into the traps. At the same time, we all know that young people are the most precious vitality of the nation and the country. If they are not properly nurtured to become good citizens, the loss to the nation and the country is simply irreparable. Secondary school education precisely undertakes the great task of nurturing the character of young people. Whether a piece of white cloth becomes red or black, secondary school education is actually the person who throws the cloth into the dye vat. In this way, we can understand the importance of secondary school education to the nation and the country. Especially in this era of arduous struggle for the nation, because our struggle cannot be limited in time and is difficult step by step, the nation and the country naturally rely on young people even more, which is to say that the cultivation of young people's character is even more worthy of attention than before. What's more, this is also a watershed era. We must not allow our young people to continue to follow the old, corrupt path. We must guide our young people onto a new, bright path.</p>
<p>But in such a serious period, we still see such two middle school principals. Moreover, we also know that in all sectors, whether military, political, or educational, even to this day, there are still countless people like these two principals. Therefore, I really can't bear to imagine.</p>
<p>However, now is a time of battle, and everything is in battle. In an atmosphere full of wartime emotions, we must not be passive anymore. For the nation, for the country, and for saving the millions of young people facing the abyss! We can no longer tolerate it. We should immediately reach out our fists and launch a fierce battle to eliminate the people around us like those two principals—that is the urgent and important work to be done now. ——In Lingdong</p>
<h3 id="e67">"Not Knowing the Taste of Meat" and Others <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Hanbo</p>
<p>Recently, a news item about "not knowing the taste of meat" was published in the newspaper, briefly mentioning the general situation of economic panic in the invaders' homeland, such as the gold rush, the soaring meat prices, etc. These are all external factors of "not knowing the taste of meat." In my opinion, it is still more appropriate to annotate the "not knowing the taste of meat" of our neighbors from a psychological point of view.</p>
<p>Since many years ago, when the quasi-wartime social structure entered a real wartime state, the hardships of the neighbors have been enough to eat early on (this naturally refers to the group of people who cannot enjoy the profits of war). However, in the past, they could still pretend to be something, and got by somehow. But now, it is no longer possible. Husbands and sons, wearing a thousand-stitch vest, die in foreign lands. The shops at home are closed down, and those that are not closed are also on the verge of bankruptcy. The recession of non-military industries has shattered their jobs. In addition, there is also the harsh government, which is fiercer than a tiger, and the comfort work that can be assigned at any time... The "source" is cut off and the "flow" is not frugal. The hearts of the widows are broken all year round. When their minds are worn out, they have no energy to do anything. "Absent-minded, eating without knowing its taste," so they "do not know the taste of meat." Needless to say, they can't eat meat. Even if they can eat it, they swallow it with tears. Where do they know whether it is sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, or salty?</p>
<p>"Not knowing the taste of meat" is the sorrow of the invaders' homeland. As for the millions of "soldiers," there are more people who "do not know the taste of salt": "Salt" is not just a reference to the fine white table salt. In a broad sense, the sea contains salt, and the ocean also contains salt. Everything that is indispensable in life contains some abstract flavor—family, hometown, husband and wife, freedom and peace, etc. The "soldiers" in foreign lands smell gunpowder, see the desolate plains and vast mountains, and hear monotonous whistling sounds and monotonous soulless work. There is no purpose in their hearts, no free will. They cannot see the blue sea at the foot of Mount Fuji, and cannot enjoy a bit of saltiness. Sometimes, they are trapped in a desperate situation, which is even more truly "not knowing the taste of salt." The sorrow of these people is completely suppressed by the horse whip. However, judging from the fragmented and known events, it is no less than the sorrow of the people who "do not know the taste of meat."</p>
<p>"Meat" is a healthy nutrient, and "salt" is the vitality of the body and mind. It is unimaginable what the result of "not knowing the taste of meat" and "not knowing the taste of salt" for many years will be. Today's double sorrow will not be difficult to become a double blow in the future. The people who only know how to "march in the alleyways" only think about the long-term existence of military fortunes, but forget that what is more important than "military fortunes" is that they themselves, a class of people, know the taste of salt and meat, but they cannot think of the suffering of those who "do not know the taste of meat" and "do not know the taste of salt." Naturally, they cannot avoid the wailing that will be linked together by these two sorrows in the near future!</p>

<h3 id="e69">Current Shortcomings of Popular Literature <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Latte</p>
<p>The re-emergence of slogans for current popular literature proves the new awareness of literary authors has become widespread after the war of resistance. At the same time, the theory of popular literature has been considerably enriched and consolidated. Although there are still no large-scale works of popular literature rapidly produced and promoted to the people, when we examine the facts, we cannot but admit that works of popular literature are already competing and advancing, and will surely bloom into a bright flower of literature, creating excellent art for the national war of resistance.</p>
<p>Naturally, we cannot close our eyes and overestimate the merits of current works of popular literature. We should also examine whether its shortcomings are currently quite serious. This is what we must point out first, and hope to overcome.</p>
<p>What shortcomings does current popular literature have in its creation? Generally speaking, there are the following two points:</p>
<p>First, the unconditional use of old forms: It cannot be said to be wrong to use forms loved by the masses and inject content related to the war of resistance and national construction as a tool for propaganda. However, many literary authors often inject content into old forms without disinfection, resulting in an unhealthy combination of form and content, which invisibly causes the loss of a work's appeal to the masses. For example, using vulgar tunes to incorporate propaganda about the brutality of the enemy army, or using grand operas of feudal categories to incorporate the historical facts of national heroes' battles. This will certainly not achieve a powerful expression or an effective response. Unfortunately, some literary authors are committing this problem. It is certainly possible to put new wine in old bottles, but if the old bottle can be washed and disinfected before filling, then the new wine will surely show its better flavor. Therefore, strengthening the careful selection of old forms is something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Second: Loss of diversity in the content of war of resistance and national construction. Although many literary writers have been able to inject the content of war of resistance and national construction into old forms, this content is very monotonous and boring. One work after another sings the praises of flesh-and-blood great walls, and chants the charges of cannons, but rarely do we see reflections of the entire lives of ordinary people in every corner of the war of resistance and national construction, and even less do we see concrete descriptions of the war-weariness and anti-war sentiment of soldiers on the enemy side. This kind of military-centrist popular literature can certainly excite people for a while when first read, but it becomes somewhat tedious after reading further. This also indicates that so-called popular literature with new content in old forms, if not extracting its themes from diverse scenes, will inevitably cause the future of popular literature to stagnate in a very narrow alley. This is also something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>I feel that the above two points are common problems with today's popular literature. In order to remedy the shortcomings of the popular literature movement, we must grasp reality, and there is a need to start anew.</p>
<h3 id="e70">"Drinking Tea" in Leisure <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Baiding</p>
<p>Although my intention is not to "eat heartily" while hiding in the rear, sometimes I cannot help but be "dragged" by friends to a teahouse.</p>
<p>The teahouse is extremely lively. In addition to being packed with people, there are many standing and waiting to "eat." Several waiters shuttle back and forth, shouting "Big buns!" "Shao Mai!" incessantly. Shoe-shining boys, medicine sellers, cosmetic vendors, and even cigarette salesmen busily approach each of the "hearty eaters" to solicit business.</p>
<p>However, the gentlemen who are accustomed to "hearty eating" leisurely light a cigarette and chat with their acquaintances while taking small sips, from counting family treasures to discussing hot political topics—they are truly talking freely!</p>
<p>Not long after my friend and I found a corner to sit down, a rather scruffy-looking gentleman suddenly came over, timidly yet seemingly very respectfully handing over a small piece of paper and walking away. I thought to myself, this is probably some kind of plea for help. But my friend took the paper, glanced at it, and handed it to me, saying, "Guessing back and forth, it's nothing more than these words." I took it and looked at it. It turned out to be a riddle, neatly written with four lines:</p>
<p>"A girl of sixteen is naturally charming,</p>
<p>Her eyes convey affection and steal souls,</p>
<p>Alas, she suffers from lovesickness,</p>
<p>…" (Guess a character)</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and asked my friend, "Isn't this the character 'Ying'?" "That's right!" my friend nodded, while writing the character '櫻' on the back of his cigarette pack.</p>
<p>After a while, the riddle-solving gentleman came to collect the answer, smiling obsequiously, clasping his hands in a bow, his attitude even more respectful than before. He saw the character '櫻' already written on the cigarette pack and said very flatteringly, "Hehe, sir has already guessed it, hehe... Sir, a reward. Hehe..." His hands kept bowing. My friend took out a copper coin from his pocket and gave it to him, saying, "These are all guessed so well, there's no interest."</p>
<p>The riddle-solving gentleman took the coin and said repeatedly, "Thank you, thank you," then pulled out another piece of paper from a stack in his hand and placed it on the table. He then ran to another seat to find a customer. I took it and looked at it. This time, it was not catering to low-level tastes, but had a strong political satirical tone, so I specially copied it down:</p>
<p>"An erotic telegram leaves my heart,</p>
<p>Even the dean steps down,</p>
<p>Two traitors offer the same advice,</p>
<p>Rambling on the war for eleven years" (Guess a character)</p>
<p>What character is this supposed to be? My friend and I thought for a long time but couldn't figure it out, and the riddle-solving gentleman didn't come back to deliver the answer. However, I feel that this kind of riddle, although that riddle-solving gentleman is close to opportunistic, is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<h3 id="e71">"Strange" <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Ziyou</p>
<p>The newspapers of the 24th of this month reported: "A strange aircraft was spotted in the skies over Kowloon last night." Following the enemy aircraft's "accidental" bombing of British territory, there comes this "strange aircraft." The people of this paradise feel somewhat less "paradise-like."</p>
<p>Shanghai once had strange fires, and the Singapore port also discovered strange sounds a few days ago. Now, a strange aircraft has been spotted in Hong Kong. In this way, the sky, the ground, and the sea all have the potential for "strange" occurrences. Mr. Dong Gong said: "When a state is about to perish, there will surely be monsters." This seems to make some sense! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p>Airplanes and warships being "strange" means either their appearance is unfamiliar or their actions are peculiar, to the point where it is impossible to distinguish them as not strange. After all, the twentieth century is a world of science. "Flying heroes" only show a few children practicing on Mount Emei, and "foreign devils" have been transformed into "foreign masters" for many years. There is nothing inherently strange in the world. The strangeness lies in the people who say it is strange. It's not like the saying, "See the strange and be not strange, and the strangeness will defeat itself." We must face it squarely! Calling those airplanes and warships strange, that is what is strange.</p>
<p>Before July 7th, or to be precise, before August 13th, whenever Japanese airplanes or warships were discovered in Chinese territory, newspapers often wrote "strange aircraft" and "strange warships," but it was an open secret that these were euphemisms for enemy aircraft and enemy warships. Reporters who saw the airplanes did not not know they were enemy aircraft, but due to "good neighborliness" (?), they had to say they were "strange aircraft."</p>
<p>Often, some people are doing things that deceive themselves. Mencius' eating meat while keeping away from the kitchen and Ah Q's spiritual victory are all examples of this. As for clearly and openly getting punched a few times, but in order to maintain friendship, insisting that it is unknown what strange hand ran over him and punched him a few times, this also does not escape the circle of self-deception.</p>
<p>Speaking in roundabout ways is very unpleasant, and is only done as a last resort. Who doesn't know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line? But what if you are not allowed to walk a straight line? Some people could walk straight, but they love peace too much, no, it's appeasement, but they insist on walking a curved path. Not only do they walk a curved path themselves, but they also try to make others follow them to a place where "this road is blocked." This is a very strange thing.</p>
