<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海之法治</h3>
<p>因×方無理之壓迫，上海報紙之受嚴厲處分者四；所以處分之者；不同其主體，不同其方式，不同其重輕，抑且不同其所稱之理由；所同者，皆英美商營而活氣充溢之華文報紙也。如此大舉，在任何國家，惟於國體政體政權發生劇變時偶見之；在蕞爾上海，則無此先例；故非依據常識常情所可加以論衡。况此四報之事，一方面以其爲正式公務機關所作之處分，故必視之爲法權之發動。又一方面，無論其爲政治性質，或爲行政性質，或爲警察性質，其性質可以不拘一格；無論其是合法，或是非法，或屬職權範圍，或竟踰越職權，或允當，或過或不及，其是非雖必有準則，顧亦未可執一而論；蓋不問處分之性質如何，處分之是非如何，凡事之業巳成爲法權案件者，則在法權發動之後，法權管轄之內，依法解决之前，皆未許以私人之見解，主觀之情感，擅事論衡。此乃現代法治精神與言論自由之領域所在，不容出入。念彼四報，吾人所極苦悶而幾至於窒息者也。</p>
<p>吾人尊重法治精神，不克於四報成爲法權案件時，爲案件之內容而有所主張；然吾人不能不更爲法治而大聲疾呼！</p>
<p>爲上海論法治，初非以上海當局旣有枉法亂法之作爲。祗以上海之遭遇，似乎使人懷疑於墨守成法之不足以適應環境；而於無可奈何之中，又似一切依法主張，近於不顧現實之高調；乃惟有以所謂諒解與合作，蘄求法外之辦法。此種苦心孤詣，誠爲達者所共諒；然其所獲之後果，將爲差勝乎？抑將爲更惡乎？此在信仰法治者，必有其正常而明確之答案；所不易答者，乃爲如何應付朝不保夕之目前？如何避免直接行動之紛擾與危機？蓋眞理與事實之所以參商，有其病因，卽上海之根本正在搖撼之中。惟以根本搖撼，不免信念徬徨，其實，根本竟至於搖撼而顚覆，誠非法治所得挽救；皮之不存，毛將安傅，是無所謂法，亦無所謂治；若乃毀法求治，何殊緣木求魚？而對於法治信念之徬徨，且將加重根本之搖撼；此又眞理而必符事實者也。</p>
<p>及至今日，關於上海之根本問題者，旣由英美兩國同時發爲嚴明之表示，主張有關上海之一切，務以地皮章程爲依歸；地皮章程乃國際條約，根據條約卽國際之法治也。此種主張，必以其最合理而貫澈；而上海根本之搖撼，必因此而歸於安定。根本安定，則不但內部尤應尊重法治，抑且愈有厲行法治之可能。於是吾人有願爲上海租界當局告者：至今日爲止，租界內之一切措施，無論其爲界內之各國居民所信任，所感戴，或所懷疑，所怨懟，顧尙未聞合法非法之爭議：是以自今日而推　法治，發揮法治精神，猶是輕而易舉。要在當局處處示人以尊重法治，以身作則，則必任何人對於當局不敢輕作法外之求。而所以表示尊重法治者，要在將每一措施，剴切示人以法權之根據：務使人人了然於措施之合法，而樂於接受法治。卽如四報之事，在上海爲空前，亦卽有說明之必要者也。</p>
<h3>晉東南抗日根據地的政權</h3>
<p>— 克寒</p>
<p>（特槁）晉東南抗日根據地包括十九個經常保持完整和二十三個不完整的縣份，這些不完整的縣，極大多數楚在同蒲綫上，它們的地面一半是在晉西，一半屬于晉東南。這一塊幅圖遼闊的地區，繁殖着五百萬人口，在全山西千三百萬人口中估三分之一。在經濟上說：是全山西最富僥的地區。在地理上說，東屏太行，西峙太岳，南北盤踞着析城，王屋，鹿台，中條，八賦諸嶺，羣山屏圍，是建立抗日根據地的理想處所，而且由于太行的踞高臨下，向東可以控制河北，山東諸省，地形又決定他成爲抗日根據地中的抗日根據地，今天華北游擊戰爭的總指揮所便設在這里。這塊廣大的領域，同時又是保衛大西北的第一道門戶。古語有云：『得上黨而得天下』，上黨便是以長治（古稱潞安府）作中心的晉南，而天下當然是河南中原了。</p>
<p>從　汾失守，整個晉東南轉入×後方以來，晉東南無論軍事，政治，經濟，文化教育，民運等各方面的建設，都有了飛　的，長足的進步，造成晉東南有史以來空前的繁榮和蓬勃的氣象。每一個到華北×後考察的人，都願意先到晉東南作一番巡禮，就在最近期內，它巳經吸引了不少的中外記者，文藝工作者，以及攝影師，藝術家……他們組織了戰地新聞服務隊，參觀團，視察團，他們預備把他們在習東南所看到誇，聽到的一切，介紹到全國，全世界。他們也帶來了攝影機，攝製每一個動人的場面，預備帶到後方去放映。的確，晉東南的一切是平凡的，但是是新頴的，當　聯　到這是在×人後方的時候。</p>
<p>東南各方面各自有其相當的進步，最重要的進步之　　地方政府的開明。晉東南政權機構的進步，不　促成　他各方面的進步，構成爲英他各方面進步的主要　　，而且更推動全山西政治的進步，今天山西其他地區的進步其　晉察翼邊區的影響，還不如說受　東南影響比較多些。</p>
<p>負責領導晉東南的最高行政機關主要的是第三，第五兩行政區專員公署，第三行政區的專員是簿一波先生，第五行政區的專員是戎子和（伍勝）先生，他們兩人是閻司令長官導領下比較進步與開明的人物，管理了十九個完整的縣，和幾個不完整的縣，前者的治區是在北面，屏擋正太路的×人，後者的治區是在南面，其主要門戶是東陽關，其他同蒲綫上二十來個祇有一半面積的縣份，以洪洞作中心的，歸第六行政區管轄，在洪洞以南迄黃河沿岸，歸第七行政區管轄，專員公署都在同蒲路西而在路東緊挨着鐵路設立了他們的辦事處，專署之下，由縣到村，佈置了有組織的行政系統，有條不紊。</p>
<p>今天撇開安定社會秩序，籌措龐大財政經濟供給巨教决死隊游擊隊及一切地方武裝等糧食軍需，施行國防敎育，動員民衆參戰等政府的功績不說，僅就行政機構本身而言，它有以下的特點：</p>
<p>第一，政權是統一的，有統一的領導和統一的工作步驟，這句話的意思，不僅是說晉東南的地方政權是統一在中央政府和閻司令長官的領導之下，而且更是說晉東南這塊抗日根據地本身在政權方面是統一的：晉東南主要的兩個最高行政機關——三，五兩行政區互相之間有了密切的聯系。薄一波和戎子和兩位專員，不但萬事洽商，意見一致，而且更組織了一個行政聯席會議，定期每月開會一次，討論和佈置晉東南的行政工作，因之，在行政工作上步調楚齊一的，領導方式也是一致的。這個經常的聯席會議之建立，爲時尙不很久，是在元且擁護蔣委員長大會上决定的，但在今天巳經可以看見他的效能，最近三，五兩行政區對迎接×人新進攻的工作佈置，除了因具體環境不同，而有某些不同點以外，基本的政策和工作都是一致的，特別是工作方式上大家都提出同樣的口號，領導的統一和工作步驟的統一。將使行政機構更能發揮其效能，將使以後的行政工作，更能順利地展開。本來在×後方行政統一和軍事指揮的統一有同樣的重要性，因為有許多問題，如財政經濟問題，統制貿易問題，祗有在劃一方針，齊一步調，相互配合下，才能够做得更圓滿，更合理。</p>
<p>行政聯席會議的組織形式，在別的地方還沒有發現過，但這的確是一種在不同的地方行政長官領導下，在工作上求得統一，聯繫的最好形式——這是晉東南政權的第一個特點。</p>
<p>第二，是實施民主政治。在山西，民主砍治很爭就被閻司令長官所提出，抗戰以前，閻司令長官就倡導人民監政的意志，但沒有能為當時各地方行政人員所重視，沒有能充分運用，祇有晉東南今天努力在實施民主政治，直到記者寫稿時止，第三行政區有四分之三的村長副是經由村民大會民選產生的；第五行政區，則有三分之二的村長副經由民選產生，有些地方，更有區長和差務處長都是民選的，這在全國範園內說來，不能不說是睢得而輝煌的成績。賢明的行政長官，他們更願意逐漸進步到縣長，都能够經由民選產生。</p>
<p>他們不但賦予民衆這種確實的選舉權與被選舉權，而且更賦予民衆以間接的罷免權，行政機關他們能够盡量尊重民衆意志，虛心考慮和接受羣衆的意見，在過去一個時期，記者剛到晉東南的時候，第五行政區的行政機構還包含了一部份過去遺留下來的貪污腐化份子，他們不關心民衆的利益，甚至壓迫民衆，阻撓民衆運動的發展，引起民衆的厭惡和反對，因血層出不窮的發生民衆向上級政府請願情事，如陵川，高平等縣的民衆曾經集合數千人跋涉到長治專署面遞請願書。碰這樣的請願運動，行政長官定會從『衙門間』走出來：在大門外接見他們，然後給他們一番安慰。並招待他們的代表住下，聽候他對這問題的答覆，當他們調查到他們的下屬的確　了民衆所檢舉的不法的惡劣情事時，他們便毫不容情的立刻把被檢舉者撤換了。這種眞正體察民情，接受民衆意見的具體事實，提高了民衆對政府的注意和關心，在晉東南，民間普遍流傳着這樣一句口頭禪——『現在可不同了。老百姓也可以出來講一句話了！」的確，山西民衆，數千年來何嘗有過這樣能够挺起身子講話的機會呢！</p>
<p>政府還給予民衆以參政的機會，這就是行政會織的設置。在設　這個機關的時候，地方行政長官公開的向民眾提出，說這是地方參議會的準備。山西的各級參議會，按照中央國民參政會的决定，是在本年元月就應該成立的，因為種種困難，至今還未能建立起來。晉東南的地方政府便以行政會議來暫代地方參議會。行政區和各縣巳經都有了行政會議的組織。各縣行政會議的組成，由縣長祖任主席，此外參加行政會議的代表分民衆團體代表和地區普選產生的代表兩種，行政會講的代表，計犧牲救國大同盟代表二人，公這團二人，農救會三人，工救，靑救，婦救，敎救各二人，紳士代表三人。地區代表，由各區普選產生，每區三人，為提高婦女地位，并且規定，地區產生的代表，每區三人中，至少得有婦女代表一人。在第五行政區範圍內，長治，晉城，長子有不少少數民族——回民，因之又特別規定：有一定數量囘民居住的區域，應有囘民代表參加行政會議。因之，囘胞發出這樣的慨詞，『祇有在晉東南，回民才能這樣被漢人所言視，行政會議無形中是决定地方施政的最高組織，通通行政會議，民衆可以檢討和批評政府的工作，提出意見討論研究和决定政府的施政方針。行政會議同時又是政府和民衆直接取得聯系的組織，政府的决定可經由行政會讓的代表傳達到民間去，使民衆了解政府的意志，能誠意的執行政府的决議，擁護政府，而民衆的意志也可經由行政會議的代表反映到政府中來，在各縣舉行的行政會議中往往以口號的狂呼和歡躍而告閉幕，他們的口號：主要的是擁護政府，擁護×××縣長等，原因楚縣長在會議中接受了他們的批評，採納了他們的意見，行政會議使政府和民衆更為接近起來。</p>
<p>實施民主政治，這是晉東南政治的第二個特點，也是最大的優點。</p>
<p>第三，是對于改善民生的注意，很早以前，晉東南的地方政府頒佈了二五　組，五一减息的法令，而且這法令在晉東南已經普遍付諸實現，有了初步的成績、由于×人九路進攻晉東南的一度殘酷的蹂躪，晉東南平白產生了不少災難民，除了中央放　來的以外，政府又特別注意到救濟災難民的工作。在這方面各縣特別設立了賑委會，籌款到各地放眼，計算起來，各縣每日敎濟災難民在三百以上。行政當局還提出口號：『村裏餓死人，由村長負責，區里餓死人，由區長負責，縣里餓死人，由縣長負責』。在這種口號下，的確，餓死人的現象是沒有發生過，各級地方政府都兢兢業業的努力着救濟工作。同時他們還倡導『以村救村』的辦法，發生很大的效果，可是，這還僅是消極的一方面，另外一方面政府還在各村設立低利借貸所，實行小本借貸，與創設合作社與小規模手工業工廠救濟失業。低利借貸所的資本大槪都在百元左右，但是依托這一百元錢，却使不少貧苦無告的民衆有了營生的機會，舊歷年節快到了，上黨銀行又格外撥出幾萬塊錢來作低利借貸。沒曾看到過地方政府有這樣注意于民衆生活的。這種對于民生的關切，大大地增加了民衆對政府的好感，使民衆衷切的想到今天的政府，的確是民衆自己的政府。同時民生的改善，又使民衆紛紛動員起來。</p>
<p>第四是行政機構本身的改善和强化。這也可以分兩方面來說，一方面楚機構本身，一方面是人才配備。</p>
<p>在機構方面，各級政府已經成爲强有力的組織。過去縣府的組織祗有行政，財政，敎育等三科，現在又增設民運，武裝等兩科，這兩科的增設，使政府不僅管理一般地方行政工作，而且有了動昌民衆武裝民衆的機關，更能集中領導，積極發揮政府的力量使政府的機構適宜於戰時領導。　（未完）</p>
<h3>最近我國教育文化事業</h3>
<p>續昨</p>
<p>推行妓女政策</p>
<p>（六）推行妓女成人敎育，近來關於妓女救國之事，時有所聞，故對　輩推行敎育，增推其抗敵信念，亦屬必要之舉，柳州特察里現有妓女一百三十三人，茲擬分作三班，派員敎授，（七）考績，每一村街里面，凡十八足歲以上，四十五歲以下之男女央學成人，在不妨礙彼等日常工作之下，每日均應入班受敎二小時，（男女分班敎授）兩個月畢業，畢業後由政府發給畢業證書，所需課本，由公家供給，畢業成績優異者，由縣政府於本年成人班終了時，擇五人至二十人，予以獎金或獎狀，以資鼓勵，其有拒絕入學或督辦不力者，則遵省頒辦法，分別輕重，予以懲處依照上列所定步驟，由縣府督促各鄉鎭，由鄉鎮督促各村街，由村街再勸導各民衆踴躍入學，這樣層層的努力幹下去，我相信柳州一萬八千七百六十七個文盲，是不難在本年內一概掃除的。</p>
<p>留學教育</p>
<p>教部調查統計過去一般情況</p>
<p>（震慶特訊）中國留學敎育情形，近由敎部調查統計甚詳，茲摘要探錄於下：</p>
<p>留學沿革　中國正式派遣留學生，始于同治十一年之選派幼童赴美，光緒元年，四批派百二十人，嗣因公使與監督意見不合，於光緒七年，將留學生撤囘，至光緒二十二年，始派官費生十三名留日，二十四年，張之洞派生三十名赴日習軍事，此後年有派遣，自費亦增多，當時留日生達萬五千人之衆，三十一年，日方擬頒佈取締外國學生規則，學生大起反對，相率歸國，一時人數大減，　並未頒布規則，又多東渡復學，此時派赴西洋留學者極少，自費亦寥寥，三十三年，淸廷宣布敎育宗旨，派各省提學使東渡考察，爲與學之備，並由學部與日文部省締結特約五校之協定，各省派遺留日學生乃有限制，辛亥革命，留日學生幾全數歸國，參加革命運動，自美國退還庚子賠款，設立淸華學校，留學歐美者乃漸多，民十四淸華改大學，停止全體學生派送美國辦法，改爲普通考試方法，年設定欵，統計該校所派學生，先后已達一千九百餘人，各省派增者亦甚多，民元以后，留日學生迭有增減，民四日本迫訂二十一條，留日學生激終義憤，報學歸者甚衆，民十三，我國與日本締結中日文化協定，設庚欵補助費學額，留日學生又逐年增加，雖十九年敎部决廢中日文化協定，但東渡學者，尙有加無巳。</p>
<p>在歐洲各國中，中國留學生之最多者，首推法國，而尤以歐戰以后，勤工儉學生人數劇增爲鼎盛時期，竟達一千六百之衆，后復有里昂中法大學之設立，赴法留學更爲利便　民十四五年間，蘇俄設有中山大學，當時粵府曾派學生赴俄留學，旋卽停止，民二十一中英庚欵重事會年設留英公費生名額，由會考試分別錄取，現巳辦過六屆，</p>
<p>留學管理　留學事務之管理，同治十一年所派赴美留學之幼生。卽派有監學二人，實卽爲留學監督，留日學生派遣，最初多數均委託日人負責敎管，民三由敎部派監督一人，各省派經理員一人，或數省台派一人，管理留日學生事務，民四設留歐學生監督管理之，惟留俄學生事務，仍由駐俄使館經理，民五設留美學生監督，管理留美學生事務，國府成立后，留日學生監督仍　設立，至抗戰發動后，暫行撤消，歐美留學生監督，則巳停止設置。</p>
<p>留學資格　中國學生前往國外留學，應以在國內不能得到適當之指導及設備，而爲國家所需要者爲限，民二十一以前，國外留學生，僅須有國內高中以上畢業程度，自二十二年公布規程，提高資格，「公費生」須具下列資格之一，（一）國內外公立或已立案之私立專科以上學校畢業，並　任與助習學科有關之技術職務二年以上者，（二）國內外公立或已立案之私立專科以上校畢業后，繼續研究所習學科二年以上，而有有價值之專門著作，或其他成績者，（三）國內外公立或已立案之私立大學或　立學院畢業，而成績優良者，「自費生」須具下列資格之一，（一）公立或已立案之私立專科以上校畢業者，（二）公立或已立案之私立高級職業學校畢業，並曾任國內技術職務二年以上者。</p>
<p>留學考核　近年來敎部對公費留學之考選加嚴，研習科目大都與各派　機關，事先議定，自費生出國，除提高資格外，各省大多數設有獎學金，以補助成績優良之自費生，留學生在國外，須按期呈繳研究成績，歸國后，並須向敎部呈騐　書，申請登記，凡此規定，留學生之管理，較前嚴格多矣，留　生研習之學科，公費生以研究理農工醫等實科為原則，數年來均秉此原則辦理，自費留學生研習實科者，亦年有增加。</p>
<p>留學人數　以數近十年度（十八年度至二十七年度）計之，總共七五四五人，其中自費六七八一人，公費七六四人，公費約合自費九分之一，以各年度言，自費生以十八年度為最多，（一五六八）因當時留學資格規定較寬，故出國者衆。二十七年度爲最少，（三三）卽因戰待限制留學所致，公費生以二十三年度爲最多，（一四一）因正值建設時期，故選派公費生特多。二十七年度　少，（二六）亦即限制留學之故，以國別論公費生以美皎多，（三一九）英次之，（二二〇）義瑞丹荷最少，自費生除日本（戰前）外，亦以美國為最多，（五二六）法國次之，荷蘭最少，十年來（自十八年度至二十七年度）領留學證書之學生，計英五九七人，（內公費二二〇）德六〇〇人，（公費八二）法七〇六，（公三四）比一八八，（公一三）義二四，（公二）瑞典瑞士四〇，（公二）奧二五，（自費）丹六，（公二）荷三，（公二）美一八四五，（公三一九）加拿大一四，（自費）日本三四八三，（公八四）埃及一〇（自費）印度三，（自費）菲一二，（自費）其他各國一六，（公四）總計十年度七千五百四十五人，內公費七六四人，自費六七八一人。</p>
<p>對外文化</p>
<p>參加國際會議　推進合作事業</p>
<p>（震慶特訊）中國參加國聯之文化事業，早在民國十九年間。最近國聯發起修訂國際文化合作專約，俾各國相互間之文化合作，更形密切，國聯徵得中國同意，並請李石曾代表中國，於二十七年十二月，在巴黎正式簽訂，此專約簽訂後，各會員國間文化事業及消息之交換，益加便利，對於中國裨益尤甚，敎育部歷來與國際文化合作事宜約述於下：</p>
<p>參加國際學術會議</p>
<p>抗戰以前，中國參加之重要國際學術會議，有國際公衆敎育會議，國際美術史大會，國際方言會議，國際文化合作委員會大會，國際宗教會諸，及法國笛卡兒會議，各代表於出席會議後，均曾提出書面報告，由敎部轉送各有關機關團體參考，在抗戰時期，對外宣傳，尤關重要，中國參加之國際學術會議，共有七次，（一）二十七年六月，在德國麥河弗郎克府之保護兒童第十三次國際大會。由駐德大使館派秘書徐澤參加，（二）上年六月，在墨西哥之哲學科學及一般文化國際會議，由駐墨公使館派員參加，（三）上年七月在日內瓦之國際敎育第七屆大會，派謝壽康參加，（四）上年七月，在柏林之國際技術敎肯會議，派謝壽康參加，（五）上年八月，在美國紐約之第二屆世界靑年大會，中國代表團有二十九人參加，（六）七年八月，在瑞士之國際歷史學會第八屆大會，派胡適參加，（七）上年九月，在比京之第二十屆世界東方學會，派謝壽康參加。</p>
<p>選送留學生與交換</p>
<p>二十五年春，波政府請中國政府選派學生一名往波留學，由波津貼學宿費，由敎育部津貼釆往旅費，當經接受，並遴選淸華大學工學院助敎方福森前往研習道路工程，卽將學成歸國服務二一十六年，敎部應德國國際學術交換處之請，决定由部與該處主辦中德交換學生事宜，第一年决定先行交換學生六名，交換望校，在中國爲中央，北京，武漢，交通，等大學，及上海醫學院，德國則由國際學術交換處負責辦理，兩國交換學生案核定後，卽值中日戰事發生，影響　校開學日期，因國德國來華學生暫緩啟程，中國學生，亦僅有　人赴德，此外意國亦曾請與中國交換學生，派　生來華。</p>
<p>設立國際文化團體</p>
<p>敎部爲溝通中外文化關係，經先後核準由中外學術人士所組織之中英，中波，中德，中蘇等文化協會，並隨時予以指導與監督，各該會年來重要工作，中美文化協會，如美國工業聯合會實習學生之選送，中英講座之交換，中蘇文化協會，如中蘇文化及其他出版物之刊行，影展書展之舉辦，蘇聯研究委員會之設立，中波，中德文化協會，如留學生之交換，出版爲之介紹等，非但足以促進兩國間文化之聯繫，抑且裨益兩國間之友誼，此外中國學術界人士，爲擁護國聯之宗旨與政策，前在北平成立之國聯同志會，亦於二十四年冬南遷，改善組織，繼續進行，該會近兩年來，從事擁護國聯之積極活動，頗獲成效。</p>
<p>交換國際出版書籍</p>
<p>中國正式加入出版品國際交換公約，始於民國十四年，現由敎部出版品國際交換處經　其事，二十五年加入交換協約者，有三十六國，二十六年又增加昆士蘭，拉晚維亞，塞爾瓦多等三國，合計云十九國，尙有非正交換國，經該處分轉出版品，從事交換者，有加拿大，南非洲，菲律濱，等及各屬地，亦有數十處，該處在戰前兩年間，經縛國內外交換品數量，（一）牧到各國委轉國內各機關之書籍，二百四十六箱，二百三十七包，（二）收到國內各機關委轉各國之畫件，七十三箱，一萬六千七百二十九包，（三）分寄各國書件，一百十三箱，八百五十九包，（四）分寄國內各機關書件，一百十一箱，五千六百包。又該處在抗戰期間，經轉國內外交換品數量，（一）收到各國轉委國內各機關書件七十七箱，又二十八包，（二）寄發國外各機關書件，五百三十八包，（三）收到國內各機關委轉各國書件，計四箱，又十包，（四）寄發國外各機關書件，計三箱，又一千五百六十包，此外德國佛朗克府大學中國學院，現仍由中國每年補助經常費五千元，印度國際大學，在在中國贊助之下，成立中國學院，將來如國際文化事業經費能增加，則中國與各國間之文化合作事業，當可逐漸推廣。至中國在英舉辦倫敦中國藝術國際展覽，使歐美人士，對中國文化有更深之認識，並增進中國在國際上之地位。</p>

<h3>海豐速寫</h3>
<p>— 小鳴</p>
<p>【續昨】海豐中年以上的女子的頭髮，恰似羅浮山上的這士，髻在頭頂，還裝七一個「髻鐘（用銀或銅製造，頗似抬上的　人　，不過還裝上許多花紋）婦女的衣服，多很樸素，但生活困苦，亦由　可見。淪豐婦女有飲「緘茶」的特殊嗜好。每晨到十點鐘左右，卽將茶葉，食鹽，芝蔴，和開水混合來飲，量大的一欽動逾十碗亦不嫌多。「生食」亦是海豐人的嗜好。「鮮蠔」「殫蝦」……祗用食鹽　過，便取來佐　，似乎頗與銜生有碍。一般的人民經濟都不齊全吃白米飯的。簡直是例外。他們每餐都是以蕃薯，一天三餐，蕃薯粥替代白米飯；較為富有的，亦不過吃蕃薯的成分少些，白米的成分多些罷了。</p>
<p>海豐因敎育不昨普及，所以中下階級的人民極端迷信。在神誕或任何時節的一天，什麼「觀音廟」「孔子廟」「城隍廟」「水仙廟」……拜着跪着的都是「善男」，而沒有「信女」，善男要打得「聖　」之後，得到菩　許可，然後才敢起立。有許多父老仍留着一條　淸頭上的龍尾。</p>
<p>海鹽因爲近海魚鹽是他大宗的出產。汕尾漁業，在全國楚很有名的，　地食鹽很平，汕頭粵北，和贛南一帶食　的供給，俱是汕尾運去海豐除魚鹽之利外，蕃薯可算爲大宗的物產了，因爲全縣都是吃蕃薯飯的啊，這地的人是沒有一家燒柴的，烹飪時，祇用木炭，卽使備上販賣的柴，亦是用火燒過來，然後販賣。</p>
<p>三。海鹽的走私賭　和奸細</p>
<p>潮汕每月仇貨進口竟有千餘萬元。海丰最少亦佔十餘萬，這不是說謊，請你到來看一看，便知道了。當你往汕尾，捷勝，靑革，公平，梅　附城：等較　繁盛的區域一　，則人造絲的紡織物，手中袋，膠鞋，兒童玩具，和各種化裝品，（仇貨最少佔十分之六）不斷的映到你底眼　來，關于粵東一帶的仇貨進口，和走私情形，我當另文發表。這種　實，自然在海丰亦一樣的存在。至於海丰的賭風，確實　盛極了，這一方面是由于沒有其它（除賭博）的娛樂，他方面由于民衆沒有各種手工業去做的原故。</p>
<p>海丯奸細，在華南燃起抗敵烈火之後，確實相當的多。</p>
<p>最令人疑惑的，是當汕尾每次將食鹽運往汕頭轉入內地的時候，必定×機飛來　鹽船轟炸。汕尾　面並無×艦，爲什麼×人知道這樣凖確的消息呢？鋤奸運動，在海　要切實的執行罷。</p>

<h3>滇緬公路歷程記</h3>
<p>— 華特主教著　錢伯明譯</p>
<p>中國和緬甸可有很大的互助，亞洲南部與中國互有很多供献，仰光昆明間薪闢的國際公路和此兩城間今在築造中的鐵路，將成爲世上重要國際道路之一。</p>
<p>近來，現代工業以及跟他國的現代交通方法的發展，巳使此路成，中國偉大西部的要道。半世紀前，有遠見之士就要在仰光昆明間敷設鐵路，但時機未成熟，因國民和國家的利益有所抵　。所幸這些障礙已是過去　跡，現在中緬間有五相貿易的現代便利，而互受其惠。</p>
<p>一月十八日，我們一行從仰光起程，循中緬新公路往昆明，經賀姆斯君的合作，我們得到兩輛四分之三噸重的道奇新卡車代步。我們一行共七人，一輛卡車裝着我們沉重行裝的大部份，內乘兩人，其餘五人，乘另一輛車座覆有　美套子的卡車，舒適地趕程。</p>
<p>一月十八日晚，我們的第一輛卡軍駛離仰光，第二輛在次日午後不久駛出，從仰光到蠻德勒的最初四百四十哩，良好的公路確和海面平行，我們在蠻德勒作幾小時的觀光，頗感興越。這名城裏有緬甸末朝的緬甸　塔和皇宮，當時我們記起　伯齡的詩句：「往勒蠻德的路上，飛魚飛舞。」但我們未見飛魚，因爲我們所經的道路，比較伊拉瓦底河中的輪船來得迅速。我們雖視中　爲此行目的地，但我並未囘憶到這種能使我們感到一破曉宛如中國的鳴雷』的經慶。</p>
<p>出蠻德勒十五或二十里，我們便開始駛上山去，駛過叢山間或山頂上而往毘明。自仰光到臘戌，除短短的不足二十里的公路以外，其餘的路面都很整齊，從仰光出發的路，也到臘戌終止。臘戍離中國邊陲約一百十哩，地位優美，拔海約三十尺，秀麗的叢山深谷環繞着，鐵路管理機關巳經把鐵道　展到城外，以利中國方面的各團　行事。在聯接地點，這些團體需要會庫，以使貯積貨物，緬　政府對於立到完成啣接中緬的鐵道和公路，現在認眞地澈底担任它的一部份責任，很多地方都可證明此點，關於英國的態度，實無疑義，很容易使人記起凡英帝國祖任一件事業，必勉力從事。</p>
<p>這條公路確實在中緬兩國政府的　理下，尤其是從蠻德勒往臘戍再到昆明，是不准公衆行駛的，自臘戍到昆明，旅客在很多障礙物前受檢驗，所幸我們在起程好久和確實動身時，都曾把我們的計劃報告兩國政府官吏，所以到處受慇懃招待和合作，還得到介紹信件和通行證，這在需要時，我們可利用之。</p>
<p>就中國方面說，運輸和在公路上行駛，須得西南運輸公司許可，在仰光昆明，和兩城間的重要地點，我們見到受過擾良訓練，有識見而彬然有禮的人士，管理西南運輸公司的辦事處，辦事爽快，我們一行裏有往年廣游中國的，對公路全綫負責人員的辦事有效和誠懇地慇懃招待，無不欣然色喜。</p>
<p>從臘戍到邊陲的緬甸政府舊時軍用公路，最初恰合所用是無疑的，但用以行駛大量的新交通，殊嫌狹隘，所以今在迅適放闊中。</p>
<p>邊境兩面都住着與中國人混居的山民有緬甸山民，也有中國山民，他們似乎是來亞洲北部的早期移民的後裔，自有其言語和許多習慣，與其他人民　然不同，在邊陲兩面，他們保持着舊式的封建組織，這些小區域　的第一區中心地在猛露，若像我們一樣，淸晨從臘戌乘車汽出發，第一天晚上便可到猛雪。我們駛到距猛雪約三十哩之處，在當地政府設立的學校裏，受到慇懃招待，當晚宿校中。</p>
<p>我們下一處駐足地是中國關卡　部所在地的龍陵，在此又見到很能幹的現代中國人查理着運輸公司的辦事處，立刻辦理我們的事務，送我們上路。因爲要完畢下一段旅程，所以我們直駛到夜間，在很高的公路上，　着凜冽的寒風。行抵下關，西南運輸公司慇　地招待我們進留客所，這是一幅改建過的廟宇，備有各種便利，以利該公司人員行事。</p>
<p>次晨，我們見到山谷裏的積雪，我們的所在地，高八千尺，而這山谷，大約還要高出二千尺光景，我們一路上所見的積　，只此一處。我們自仰光到昆明。確未遇到下雨或降雪，可說是幸運閃爲有叢山縣崖，所以忽遽建造這公路的路工，不得不在山側和山面，胼手紙足地用人力來開闢</p>
<p>公路上下面，常有下大雨便會給冲歆的石塊和泥土，不是公路下面疏蝕，便是給上面散下的泥上等所阻斷。目前半職長久的乾燥季節裏，此路十分安全，但在六月的兩季內，或許就有很多困難，管理人員現已用數千工人，把危險的地方放寬，上下面的泥土甚物，多加去除，緬洞上建造石質路面，以代用木暫架的路面，並减少若干地方的傾斜程度。</p>
<p>凡經過此新公路，便更　信此次戰爭，中國必能得最後勝利，有完程可駛載重　車的道路，其本身卽有重大意義，且有今在迅速建造中的鐵道，將和這公路平行血馳，可預卜偉大的華西，將因此不復如往時的孤立。</p>
<p>在這些區域內，無人姻過密之感，但頗感到有着現代的運輸方法，將在人　和物質雙方，迅迅發展中國四南部的富源。</p>
<p>中國沿海城市旣多被侵略者佔據，中國人民生活中必需品的鹽，就有調整其供給的必要，偉大的華西有巨大的鹽藏，其一便在此西南區，沿公路可見到數萬方鹽磚，形狀別緻，爲便於背負，此種鹽藏，顯自遠離古湖的邊緣處所取出，缺少沃　，若在湖濱發現鹽藏，而有魚　蔬菜等物和鹽粒沉在一起，便含有沃素，我在新公路某數段見患甲狀腺腫者的衆多，爲前所未見。</p>
<p>這不過舉出中國在開關運輸新便利後所能獲得的富源之一。自仰光到中國邊陲，甚至更遠些，曾見數千輛牛車，新公路甚至使此種車輛的運輸，也更具效用，無論誰駛離牛車區域後，暫於辦理各種現代產物和貿易的人工不足，必得深刻印象。因此，中國旣已購有汽車數千輛，行駛於西南，則對即將到來的轉變，如果記　起來，是很僥興趣的。</p>
<p>此次戰爭像其他戰事一樣，他日將結束，中緬公路在承平時期，甚至將校目前的緊急時期更具重大效用，似乎勢必成爲世上著名風景優美的國際道路之一。在此路上行駛幾天，廣漢的景物，叢山峻林，懸崖幽壑，刻刻變化不停。因爲地形比南部高得多，所以氣温凉爽，空氣淸鮮，而不過於寒冷。如中國旅行社，通濟隆公司，和美國運通公司等代理機關，他日導週游全球者舒適地駛過此公路，當可知其爲獲利豐厚的業務。現在乘汽車從臘戍到昆明，四天巳足够，假如爲預定時日所迫促，還可在更短的時間內完畢旅程。另一方面，假使誰希望露宿或爬山，消磨兩週或一月的光陰，那末，這倏公路將給他以最愉快休假的機會。</p>
<p>中緬公路的利益並非單方面的，但緬甸得益更多於中國，而中國的輸出入貿易，也將使緬甸人民獲益甚大。</p>
<p>我們在緬甸雖　盤桓數天，但已見到該國怎樣的成爲目前戰爭的另一處競爭場所。緬甸政府及其許多眞正政治家和有見識的民事領袖，都知己國和中國將來可由此公路和鐵道，獲得利益。但那些正用盡方法擬阻　中國的自由和發展者，却利用金錢向他們認爲能爲所動的緬甸人，作曲解的宣傳，對於「亞洲人的亞洲」一語，加以非法的曲解，中立觀察家以爲這呼號能否愚弄他人，不無可疑，如阿白拉罕林背所言：「你能够始終欺騙若干人，但不能始終欺　一切人』！</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>日謀統制沿海船業</h3>
<p>上海江海關代理副稅務司曆田氏對外宣稱，自下星期四（六月一日）起，凡在中國沿海航行的外國船舶，皆須携帶日本海軍的許可證，否則將受日本海軍的拘捕。</p>
<p>屬田是海關職員，依法無　作此種宣佈，因此這種宣佈亦無法律上的效力。然而法西斯侵略者一貫行爲，都是破壞法律與秩序的，祇要有利於法西斯的侵略與劫奪，則牠們的一切投機冒險破壞刦奪屠殺××××等行爲，就是牠們法西斯侵略者的法律。所以，曆田，胆敢在其宣佈日方此種意圖之後，說『這是日本當局因軍事之需要而决定』的！也就是說，日方這種意圖極有成爲事實的可能的；</p>
<p>日×統制我國沿海航業，當然亦有其軍事上加緊威脅我淪陷區戰門的意義，但主要企圖，則在於推進一步威脅歐美列强，特別是企圖切斷英美法各國在遠東的命脉，而加强其在佔領區的劫掠與壓榨，以挽救其侵華戰爭所遭受的嚴重的厄運，卽退一步，亦可作為目前租界問題談判的一種條件，而便利其攫取租界上的特權，因此我們可以明白指出，日×這種企圖，是在英美法各　尙未結成統一戰綫以制裁東方××之前的一種攻略，是日×準備全面排擊歐美列强在遠東勢力××××！</p>
<p>因此，我們與論界應該動員起來，促請歐美列强與友邦人士的嚴密注意，我們應該嚴正指出，日方此種意圖，確有迅速變成事實的可能，而日×此種行動，不祗破壞中國海關行政，並且違反國際公法，特別是意圖刦奪及破壞歐美列强在遠東權益，英美法各國，尤應迅速採取有效步驟，予以適當與必要的制裁與反擊！我們深信，日×此種行爲是經不起歐美列强的聯合對付的！</p>

<h3>邁斯基</h3>
<p>— 董平</p>
<p>蘇聯駐英國大使邁斯基，現在是個紅人了。但是，如果，二十七年前，不是一張破紙救了他的命的話，這世界上是不會再見到這位矮胖子的外交家了。</p>
<p>邁斯基是一個猶太醫生的兒子，眞名叫伊凡李柯維茨基；誕生於西伯利亞，在奧莫茨克受的敎育。在沙皇時代，他是一個活躍的靑年記者。</p>
<p>他逐漸地對政治感覺興趣起來，可是，不幸得很，他選錯了一個黨。他參加的是社會民主黨，那是反對列寧的極端革命思想的。</p>
<p>一九〇五年布爾希維克革命沒有成功，邁斯基乘勢痛述了一頓恐怖主義無用論。</p>
<p>一九一二年，他的激烈的文章，引起了布爾希維克的痛恨。他的性命立刻遭到恐嚇，於是，他便不得不計劃逃亡英國。</p>
<p>在他離開俄國之前，他云見他一個唯一的有勢力的朋友，叫邱吉林的，邱吉林當時是莫斯科帝俄外交部的要員。</p>
<p>當他向邱吉林告別時，邱吉林給了他一封信，叫他永遠帶在身上，邁斯基可並不經意，只隨便地塞在袋里，後來便忘記了。</p>
<p>那時布爾希維克的密探，正緊緊地追着他。不過，他很幸運地竟越過了邊境。在一九一二年夏天，他到了新哈夫地方。</p>
<p>在新哈夫海關，邁斯某可又碰上了厄運。因他不懂英語，海關上找了一個譯員來，告訴他：依照英國規定、外國人非携有現欵五磅，不得入境。</p>
<p>於是，邁斯基只好掏錢了，他慢慢地，好像故意延宕時候似的，把錢放到桌子上去。最後，他搖了手，表示盡於此矣。關員跑過來數錢了，一次，兩次，三次，這自然不會錯了。他告訴邁斯基，現在只有三鎊二先令六便士，還差一鎊十七先令六便士。</p>
<p>這可就糟了，錢不足，邁斯基是要破解回俄國境的，那兒正有獵尋他的人等着。</p>
<p>邁斯基想要挽救這悲慘的命運，只有在身上亂找，希望能找點意外之財來。</p>
<p>結果，錢仍然是一個沒有。可是，他却在袋里拉出了一張破紙來。那便是幾個月前邱吉林交給他的那封信。</p>
<p>這封信就救了他的命，因爲那信上由俄國官方證明了邁斯基是一個亡命者，因爲政治原因，被迫逃亡。</p>
<p>立刻，海關對他改變了態度，准許他入境了，因爲英國向來准允亡命者入境，而無限制的。</p>
<p>在以後五年中，邁斯基便居留在英國，在幾家俄國亡命者的報紙上，發表文章以爲生。</p>
<p>到了一九一七年的俄國大革命，邁斯基以爲他的黨。或足孟雪維克、總有一個會成功的。那麽，他就可以返國了。</p>
<p>但是，結果又是布爾希維克成功了，他又只好再度逃亡。這一次他是逃到他的誕生地西伯利亞去的。</p>
<p>在那里，邁斯基埋頭著作，寫了好幾本關於政治及經濟的書籍，後來，這些書給蘇聯政府中人見到，他們覺得不用邁斯基，是太可惜了，</p>
<p>一九二〇年，他們之間媾和了，邁斯基跨進了蘇聯外交部。一九二二年，他担任了外交部情報部主任，那時他便和一個英國女子叫史凱賓的結了婚</p>

<h3>普及教育掃除文盲的前奏　新文字第一課</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>新文字訓練班始業式。張一麐</p>
<p>「新文字截止報名！』</p>
<p>新文字學會主辦的『新文字師資訓練班』，發表招生消息的第二天，這塊「後至原諒」的牌子就掛了起來。從這裏，可以看出一般人對于新文字興趣之濃厚，更可以看出靑年人求知慾的亢進。</p>
<p>前天晚上，他們開始第一課的學習了。</p>
<p>地址是借用灣仔致中學校，一個不十分大的敎室擠滿了六十個學員，還有一二十人是旁聽生，都是精神活潑的男女靑年。</p>
<p>始業的儀式是先請全國聞名的蘇州『老子軍』，現任參政員的張一麐先生致訓。張先生鬍髮雪白，可是精神還是十分健旺，思想亦是保留着他的靑春。</p>
<p>老人家開口免不了『從前的時候』。張先生就將從前中國語言運動作了一個史的叙述。舉凡前淸三十年前的注音符號，民元蔡元培先生的讀音統一會，民七吳稚暉先生之國音字典，從前駐日大使某君提倡新文字之經過，敎會爲推行聖經用羅馬字敎學各地方言之效果……如數家珍一般地說得十分詳盡。歸到本題來就是新文字爲歷史進化必然的成果，是最進步的文字，是掃除文盲最好的工具。因此，諄諄勗勉學員有始有終地學習，人人都做普及敎育的急先鋒。</p>
<p>張老先生越說越起勁，滔滔地還加上很多動人的引伸。</p>
<p>張先生在『我的國語觀』一文中，曾說過文盲好像肚子鬧餓，非趕快救濟不可。用注昔符號的效果有如乘人力車一樣，用新文字就好比乘飛機了。蘇聯的文盲從前是在百分之九十以上，自從用新文字普及敎育之後，就急轉直下，識字的反在百分之九十以上了。新文宇與政治的淸明亦有密切的關係，官吏的貪污時常是利用人民不識字，沒有知識的機會，推行新文字提高人民的文化水準，亦是抗戰建國一個最基本的工作，對於政府推行新政是一支莫大的助力。希望在香港幹得好，可以作爲全　的模範。最末，張老先生對於出錢出力舉辦『新文字訓練班』的王君恆，周華松，孫源，吳大立，握丹，陳薪，陳照秋，曹霖生，馮裕芳諸先生表示讀佩。</p>
<p>王君恆先生將張老先生的蘇州官話繙譯爲廣州話，大家對於這位語言畢專家用極短時間學會的『新型廣州話』頗感興趣，記者亦很佩服他說話的天才和勇氣。</p>
<p>接着，就是軍委會政治部設計委員馮裕芳先生演講，他在外國留與十多年，認爲一切變化最大的是文字。凱末爾創造新士耳其之成功，改良文字就是其中的要看。</p>
<p>至於文字改革運動最偉大的却首推蘇聯，直到今日，蘇聯巳有一百廿八種新文字，在國會中可講十一種方言，可寫十一種文字了。這就是新文字的進步與民族平等的徵兆，囘顧我國呢，要是以北平話爲標準，最多數的勞苦大衆，簡直沒有時聞和精力去學習，照一般的統計，學習漢字直至能閱報，能寫信，須在五千小時。每天望習五小時亦需要三年的時間，農人，工人忙於勞動，一天最多能够抽出一小時來讀書的話，到進棺材的時候，還是不涌——這是實在事實，引起全體哄然大笑。</p>
<p>嬰是用新文字呢？根據上海的經驗，最笨的文盲一百五十點鐘就能够閱報，寫信。聰明的，只需八十小時便通暢了。至於受經過敎育的，十多個鐘點亦就可以精通了。</p>
<p>我們並不反對漢字，但是，時代所趨，中國將有二種文字，富人可以有時間去學習漢字，貧苦大衆，要有文字的工具去讀報，寫信，研究各種學問，就非新文字不可。不用新文宇，勞苦大衆一定是永遠與知識絕綠。</p>
<p>就是英文，亦是非改良不可。我們中國學生從初中到高中直至大學畢業，化了十年的時間，對于英文，能够通順的究竟多少呢？</p>
<p>外國人亦巳有這般感覺，巳經在努力改善英文。因爲文字好壞的標準，就是能否以最短的時間運用文字的符號作爲表情達意的工具。根據香港報紙的銷路，可知道一百人中九十五人沒有看報紙的。這個最大的羞恥，是非趕快以新文字來挽救不可。</p>
<p>接着陳薪先生演講，後來就正式開始上課了。第一課楚王君恒主講『理論』，第二課是吳大立主講『讀本』，直至九時半方盡興結束這始業的第一課，每個學員只花三個銅板買課本，其他一切費用都沒有。以後上課時間是在星期一三五八晚上七時至九時。課程有理論，牘本，寫法，時事座談，選讀，作文，敎投法，　譯，唱歌等科。六星期畢業後，就　選派成績優異者赴各地行新文字，並由該會每月；人津貼港幣二十元，一個偉大運動的發軔，我們謹致無限的祝望！</p>

<h3>『一年間』在重慶演出</h3>
<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>香港亦將排演該劇　均為救亡日報籌款</p>
<p>（重慶通訊）『一年間』是夏衍新寫的四幕劇、這個戲是爲金山王整等出國爲第五集團軍募集傷兵工場等欵而寫的、夏衍先生主持救亡日報、原巳很忙、但爲了此事重大、金山等又愁沒有新的可演的劇本、一再情商慛促、才忙裏偷閑趕寫了出來、</p>
<p>戲雖是忙裏偷閑趕出來的、可是『一年間』之爲傑出的新寫實主義的劇本却還是衆口一致承認的、戰　沒有一隻公式的救亡面孔、可是却揚溢看濃厚的對於抗戰勝利的自信和樂觀的氣氛、人物性格的刻劃顯明和結束的聰明有勁、更是使這部戲成爲傑作的一大理由、預料這部戲在美國上演的時候、使美國人民更明瞭於中國的堅强不可屈服、將是毫無問題的、</p>
<p>却說這部戲除金山王瑩等在將美國演出之外、在重慶、最近也在國泰大戲院演過、配上堂堂之陣、生意好得不得了、榮譽座的要價是每對五十元、然而結果還是客滿、甚至連圾璃　也給擠碎、管理前台的王普笙穿了他的上校制服、結果也依然不能把秩序維持得整然有序、</p>
<p>這次公演是爲救亡日報募欽的、結算下來盈餘了七千餘元、演出陣容、彈硬之至、導演是應雲筲、演員則趙丹飾那個堅强正義的老者劉愛盧、白楊飾新娘、舒綉文飾姑母綉笙、王爲一飾失敗主義者明揚、英茵飾一個住亭子間的救亡份子喻志華、其他角色、如德方、阿樹等等、也均一時之選，這祗要看白楊祇飾一個戲不多的新嫁娘，便可以看出來了、至於戲的背景、則第一二幕是在沿滬杭路的某小站、第三四幕則是淪陷後的上海、</p>
<p>【按】重慶之外、最近得到消息、聽說在香港也正有人在預備把它演出，</p>
<h3>×攝影隊　赴杭攝取影片　巳於週一抵滬</h3>
<p>自東京出發來華攝影的人員、巳於星期一搭長崎丸到滬、一行二十四人、包括日本的演員、導演、和技術人員</p>
<p>彼等到滬後、卽將轉道往杭州、攝製一九三七年十一月五日在杭州灣登陸情形、作爲『人與地球』一片的景、</p>
<h3>美國電影藝術院　明星給獎夜　『奧斯卡』金像　分大中小三種</h3>
<p>美國電影藝術科學院在每年三月閒、終把過去一年中最成功的男女演員和配角明星選出、頒給『奧斯卡』金像獎、以資紀念和鼓勵、而這一次的給獎典禮、也在最近舉行一過、當這天晚上、整個好萊塢影城都爲之轟動歡狂、尤其是幾個得獎的明星、更覺得光榮和受人注目的、</p>
<p>獲得首選的男女最佳演員、是在『孤兒樂園』中飾牧師的史本山屈萊賽、和在『紅衫淚痕』中演南方　婦的　帝黛維絲、他倆都是第二度得獎了、而史本山在去年給獎禮舉行時、恰巧生病、而他妻子代領、今年他又得獎、能够親自接受這隆譽、所以格外高興、至於　選最好的男女配角的、是華爾脫勃倫南和費彭脫倆二前者在『香姝寶馬』和後者在『紅衫淚痕』中的演枝、都是足以領受『奧斯卡』而無愧、他們四個、在千百張肉眼和照相機眼下、一一由特烈克、哈佛基先生、授給與大『奧斯卡』金像獎、</p>
<p>此外還有二個男女、也受到這種無上榮譽、男的是卡通畫家華德狄斯耐、因爲製作『白雪公主』而得獎、他是由秀蘭鄧波兒授與一大『奧斯卡』和七個小『奧斯卡』、象徵白雪公主和七個矮人、女的是妙齡歌后伙安娜寶萍、她是由「木人」却利麥卡露的爸爸埃加勃根授與一個中『奧斯卡』（照片刊九日本報）本來狄安娜的獲獎、就是因爲她由童年而少年的表演成功才得到的、</p>
<p>在許多來賓中、最引人注目的、是曼兒奧勃朗美國大總統的兒子（新加入影界同高爾温合作的詹美羅斯福）在一起、結婚不久的海帶拉瑪和金麥蓋夫婦倆也雙雙演出、離婚不久的桃樂珊拉摩和一個專專發掘新人的影業要員惠尼洛凱摩來是聯袂而來、還有琴逑羅吉絲、愛麗絲費等、都同着男友在筵席上談笑風生、顯出很親密的樣子、</p>

<h3>汕頭·在瘋狂的空襲中！</h3>
<p>— 陳熹</p>
<p>（本報汕頭特訊）汕頭，在瘋狂的空襲中。前幾天（五·四——五·七）被炸的瓦礫還未整理，同胞底血跡還未乾的時候，今天（十七），它們又毫無忌憚地來襲了！</p>
<p>八時卅分，緊急警報像鬼哭一機地響起來，那短促而凄凉的聲音在空中打着旋子，因爲多次血的敎訓，人們開始混亂起來了，大禍臨頭似的奔跑着，哭嚷着，發呆着，避靴室裏擠滿了人，母親們緊抱着孩子抖顫着，靑年夥子謾罵着……，</p>
<p>接着，敏捷的聽覺就聽到「嗡嗡嗡……」的機聲了，我放下了工作，站起身來向窓外一看，—太陽巳將它含淚的眼睛藏在悽慘的黑雲背後，天空是喑淡極了，灰色的帷幕籠蓋着大地，平時，人們每日都携老帶幼地逃避去對岸的礁石去，可是，誰有想到這樣的天氣×機會來襲呢？</p>
<p>三架×機驕傲地飛得極低，那聲音，利錐似的刺着人們底心脾，這是×機逞兇的先聲，也就是人們從生至死之閒的一種預兆！</p>
<p>果然，「隆隆」連續地彈聲傳響通來，連鬥窗都跳動着。這是人們所熟知的音響，當人們聽到這音響的時候，就會本能地一震，也會馬上意識到一座座的建築物在倒坍了，一批批的同胞罹難了！</p>
<p>防空部隊的機槍手「咯咯」地迎擊上去，狡猬的×　也開機槍掃下來，旣這般地，汕頭跌在極恐怖的深陷中，除了這恐怖的聲昔之外，沒有半點兒聲息，空間只瀰漫和充滿着火藥和血腥的氣味！……　（未完）</p>

<h3>賣花女（六）　Pygmallon　米高梅公司出品　原著　蕭伯納　主演　李思廉霍華　温悌希拉</h3>
<p>他同　克林到母親家告訴他，她一點也不同情說：「她爲你做了那些事，你也沒有謝她？沒有讚美她？而她向你擲了一雙拖鞋？要是我的話，我眞不肯那樣寬赦對待你呢！」她就帶她們進她自己房間。「現在你答應我好好兒吧。」她便開了房門。</p>
<p>只見愛利莎坐在裏面做着針線。『早安，畢克林將軍。好啊，告訴了她。』</p>
<p>『　！』女記者驚呌說。希金走到畢克林面前失望的說，「這　法拆穿了。」</p>
<p>正在這時候，母后到了。全體都去迎接。忽然畢克林晚，「希金，你看！」</p>
<p>有一位官員引導愛科莎到皇后面前去。愛利莎毫無難色，態度自然的上前行禮。</p>
<p>皇后伸手摸撫她的臉頰。『美麗的女郎，』她低聲的說，『我的兒子定會非常喜歡和你跳舞呢。』</p>
<p>愛利莎低頭答應了。便用優美的姿態和太子起舞。</p>
<p>卡伯帝站在希金邊笑着。</p>
<p>那個女記者請求說，『密司脫卡伯帝，請你告訴我，密司杜麗特兒到底是什麽樣人？』她在皮袋內取鉛筆和紙。</p>
<p>但是卡伯帝搖頭『這是我的秘密，』他停頓了一會，『但我要去告訴皇后，應該給她知道。』</p>
<p>希　只覺得渾身發冷。</p>
<p>卡伯帝接續說，『她是——假裝的！』</p>
<p>唉，希金眞想不到今晚會有這樣的局面呢。</p>
<p>卡伯帝還晚『而且她還不是英國人呢，沒有一個眞的英國人能說話這樣美麗的。只有外國人有人敎了才能這繳。她是個匈牙利人。』這時候旁邊的客人都在注意他的說話。聽了都非常　奇。</p>
<p>『而且——是位公主！』卡伯帝最後却說驚人　出更這的話。（未完）</p>

<p>經濟欄　來論</p>
<h3>所謂〔華興商業銀行〕及其作用</h3>
<p>— 寒暉</p>
<p>、然而中國商人收集此項軍用票後、迅卽到上海或其他商埠向日本商人購買日貸、日本商品的輸入、雖在急劇的增加、但其無償的取得工業原料和食糧的目的、旣未達到、反白　了可以取得的外匯出口資源、日本中小商人雖不敢公然拒絕軍用票、但已怨聲載道、日本原意、這種軍用票、可以減輕其惡性通貨膨脹的危機、現在已完全失敗了、所以這一次設立的「華興銀行」、形式上與北方的一聯銀」不同、主要者有二、</p>
<p>第一、性質上的不同、　銀為『北京臨時政府』及强迫北方各銀行而合組、「　　」則為「南京維新政府」及日本六大銀行所投資、、前者雖說可向朝洋銀行成立信用惜欵、但非日本銀行直接投資、後者却很顯明的為日本六大銀行所合股、且『華興』兩字下又加『商業』兩字、更與『聯銀』的之所謂『國家銀行』的性質可比、</p>
<p>第二、券價的不同：『聯銀』券與日元平價、作用為代替　幣（其失敗已如上述）、「華興」券據說法幣為準備、並不與日元連</p>
<p>至於發行『華興券』的作用、約有下列四項</p>
<p>（一）日本利用「華興」券於日　佔領區內、而在上海『黑市』中吸收外匯侵蝕幣的準備金、以增加其侵華軍費的支付力、</p>
<p>日本欲以「華興」券、在佔領區內長期的無限制的掠取工業原料品和食糧、而拒絕中國商人以「華興」券直接購買日貨、使日本中小商人不致再有收受軍用票的痛苦、</p>
<p>（三）日僞利用「華興」券以支付駐華日軍費的一部份及僞組織之經費、以彌補日偽雙方的財政恐慌、</p>
<p>（四）「華興」銀行將為日本統制上海及江南外匯及國外貿易的機關、它將强迫出口商人將外匯買與「華興」、由此、一方可以充實日元的準備、一方又利用長同及內津運輸的獨佔、促進日本商品的輸入、排擠歐美商品的市場、也就是欲以商品輸出的擴大、以增加其資本的累積、</p>
<p>上述四項作用、可說是同時並進的、其終極目的、無非是斥英美經濟　益、破　法幣制度、而完成其上海金融市場亦加入日元集團的迷夢、但這種目的、决無實現可能、</p>
<p>第一、如以「華興一券牧兌法幣、因法幣信用穩固、「華興」券發行額又無限制、故佔領區的人民勢必收藏法幣、抬高法幣券價的慘落、自在意中、</p>
<p>第二「華興」券濫發的結果、淪陷區內的物偎勢必高漲、不僅日本牧羅江南農產品以充工業原料及食糧的進行將受打擊而且佔領區內人民購買力的減低、而使日貨輸入激减、</p>
<p>第三、「華興」券價慘跌、物價高漲、勢必引起戰區內的中國商人的破產、則依恃城市商人的僞組織財政、勢必更其恐流、而日軍就地給養的辦法、勢必更起困難、</p>
<p>第四、如日本在上海利用「華興」銀行統制外匯、在客觀的環境上看來、實難成功</p>
<p>上述的矛盾、乃是「華興」券發　後必至的結果、非特不能使日本經濟機構、受到援助、反而加速它的崩潰、日本　見到這種危機、所以至今尙未　實統制上海外匯的計劃、欲以其他的手段、來引誘中國和隱美商人的合作、其成功的希望、更」的先聲、但至今尙未有下文、可知　自我懷疑程度之高、</p>

<h3>新詩的辯護</h3>
<p>— 邢光祖</p>
<p>早期提倡新文學的人，經過了不少的困難，終於斬除了那些『頑固』的籐　；多年來靠着許多新的作家的栽培和灌漑；新文學的園地裏，巳然產生出不少美麗的花卉，但是近年來，却有同一種子內所生長出來的植物，在這園子裏妨害着其他柿物的生長，我認爲是很可惜的。</p>
<p>我常常以為整個新文學運動是一個新詩的運動，不信，我們很可以舉出一些實例。用白話寫散文有的有明淸的小品，以白話作小說的有曹雪芹施耐庵做前驅，用白話寫戲劇的有元代的戲曲（尤其是那些念白），至於以白話寫詩的，還純粹是新文學運動的產兒。白居易雖然想使詩『老嫗能解』，但祇還是詩的理論，沒有實踐。并且我們試看良友新文學大系文學理論集內胡適之先生的「遍上梁山」一文，就會明白他的文學革命的主張是以白話寫詩做　幹的，所以新詩是新文學運動的特產，是新文學運動的主腦；那些侮蔑新詩的，就是侮蔑新文學運動。</p>
<p>侮蔑新詩的，除了先前彭嘯殊所說的「占迷」人物外，很出人意料的，却是一些話劇編作者·丁西林在他的獨幕劇「一隻馬蜂」中，曾經諷刺過新詩，但是好像為時間所消蝕，巳不為人注意，比較近一點的，如阿英的「春風秋雨』借用劇中人倪敎授的口吻，用幾段『歪』詩來攢美他的愛人鳳雲，以及最近馮執中所改編的戲劇名叫「裝腔作勞』內，其中有一大段是嘲卉新詩的，而且裝腔作勢得很利害。不過，新詩雖然經過了一隻馬蜂的毒刺，依舊巍然地存在着：春風秋雨，只是一時地撩亂人心；至於裝腔作勢也徒然使人感到它做作和虛偽而已。</p>
<p>記得史蒂文孫（R.L，Stevenson經說過：「我時常猜疑］覺得公衆趣味是一種混雜的產物，是墨守成　和虛偽的結合。』對於新詩，那些頑固派抱輕視的態度，正是因為他們墨守成法的執見太深的緣故，至於那些諷刺新詩的文學家，也祇因為對於新詩缺少深切的認識和研究，一則不看新詩一則淺嘗新詩，兩派都是沒有入門，都是俗人。不足以談詩。『說詩管窺』曾說『好詩乃俗人之藥』，我也是同樣的主張這些「心俗』的人必需消除他們歧靦的心理，多續一些新詩集才是。</p>
<p>也許一般諷刺新詩的劇作者，並沒有成見。在戲劇裏運用一點諷刺，正如藥店廣告一樣，不過是想多吸引一些觀衆。例如馮執中的『裝腔作勢』（可以不必用引號）中所寫一首詩：「啊，啊，啊！　而地不留，這還不要緊，我偷偷地望了你一眼、你兩隻電燈泡似的眼睛偷去我的心。賊啊，賊啊」！「這是我從中法劇藝社演員台詞中記起的，或者有錯誤。」他在戲劇裏參插了這段，許是用乖訛的（Incongr-uous）言辭，來換取看客的笑聲的。如其是這樣，那麼我們也要要求作者的健全的藝術良心。</p>
<p>同時我們也得反躬自省，來細察一下現有的新詩壇，當然我們不能否認許多新詩的確是有缺陷和幼稚的，多年來　牛似地演進，確乎會叫一般愛瞧熱鬧的着急。不過我總相信幼稚並不足詬責新詩，時間還長，大噐向來是晚成的，（祗要你不天折，你總會見到它花開茂盛的季節。（况且新文學中，不論是散文，小說，或是戲劇，都犯着同樣的症候。誰能說曹禺的「日出」與孫毓棠的「寳馬」八百行的長詩，其中亦何嘗有高下之分？在這裏，我跟邵洵美先生一樣，要套用語堂先生的調子說；「新文學的成功，新詩的成功也。」</p>
<p>新詩在新文學內的所以不鋪張的原由，據人家說：「我們祇有寫新詩的人，而沒有讀新詩的人。』任何雜誌的編者，總感到新詩的投稿人最多；而所有書賈都覺得詩刊和詩集的銷路最少。這種畸形的現象之所以存在，據我推測，不外乎兩點：一是因爲詩人們大抵楚孤芳自賞和不事鋪張的最上乘的詩人慣常是最拙劣的廣告宣傳員。并且詩人自有他完整的個性和高尙的趣味，他决不肯投羣衆所好，悉心遷就。另一點是因為從事文藝者或詩的批評家缺乏同情和鼓勵，這無種情的抨擊與冷酷的諷刺，平常總是那些勢利小人（Snobs）的技倆。</p>
<p>末了，我們得感謝那些譏諷新詩的人，因為「諷刺是善意的朋友一，朱吉爾【Cbur-chill】不是說過的麼？同時我們也得規勸那些挖苦　詩的人，因為培根【Bacon】說得好「那些有諷刺起人家的牌氣的和使人害怕他們機智的鋒鋩的人，得担心人家把他們永遠地記起。」</p>
<h3>沒有聲音的歌</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>寂寞的時候，心頭的冷落禁不住幻想的空愁，像是墜入地球的深縫，掉進千萬丈的深淵去。</p>
<p>一身凉，攪着寂靜的思想。</p>
<p>我要唱，唱一曲沒有聲音的歌。</p>
<p>記得（其實是一個美麗動人的謊）多少年前，天上人間是一般的，人與神亦沒有分野。春天的風像一陣輕烟，在空中飄出一座女神的模像——你信嗎？你相信人間真有過和平嗎？</p>
<p>朋友，別漫—除了女神之外，你也應該知道還有魔鬼吧。魔鬼，是的，魔鬼也曾在太陽落山以前跋扈過一時。它曾踏破了女神的像，也打碎了和平的高碑。但是，你也該懂得：太陽打東邊起來，雖然中午時，威勢逼人，可是終於在西邊落山。</p>
<p>我又記得幼時最愛看的景物，湖上落日。</p>
<p>是玄武湖。柳枝的縫里，紅色的雲中，我看見過血輪沉沒在台城的磚石下面，那時候，湖面的色，湖面的空氣，湖面的韻律，綴成了阿波羅筆下的風景畫。</p>
<p>也是北海漪瀾堂前的廊間，仿膳的岸邊五龍亨的左右，我曾留下個不深不淡的痕跡，如今又是三月天氣，落日的美景又是上市的時候，我在地球的深縫，千萬丈的深淵里，拾得一片記憶，南京，北平，雖不是家鄉，也還是親切的故土，値得在這一片記憶中掏出一絲情趣留在眼珠上神經邊，供我寂寞時的憑念。</p>
<p>我要唱，唱一曲沒有聲音的歌。</p>
<p>可是我遠聽得一聲低音奏，吟着生命的力。</p>
<p>瞧，天邊浮來一朶藍——是女神隨手灑在碧空的星點是宇宙頭上的一絲柔髪—是天上人間生命的源泉。</p>
<p>當我憶起舊日看得高興的落日美景：我笑了，冥想中，太陽浮在水面，　着輕快的調子。穿過水面，在泥沼深處，又有魔鬼的形迹，沉在水底。</p>
<p>不是嗎，太陽雖然在午問威勢逼人，可是終於在西邊落山。</p>
<p>我要唱，唱一曲沒有聲音的歌。</p>
<p>但是，一身凉，攬着寂　的思想：抬如，又瞧見天邊一朶藍，那永生的美。</p>
<h3>『義賣』和『義送』</h3>
<p>— 丁三</p>
<p>最近，上海某校的同學。曾經縫　了手帕，結紮了紙花，舉行義賣献金，這是顯示出靑年學生，救國并非無門，條這樣地去做小生產，小義賣，小献金，也是救國的一個方法，不一定要上前綫去搖旗吶喊的。</p>
<p>在前，該校普一甲的一班同學【共四十餘人】募集了六十多元，貿了十八打黑襪子，在某星朝日下午，長途地步行到孤軍營中去慰勞，在買襪子時。襪廠老板聽說了他們去慰勞孤軍，而孤軍又正需用襪子（這是他們去信詢問而後知道的），就加贈了兩打，凑滿了廿打，這班同學掬腰包賣襪子去慰勞，可以說是『義送』，而襪廠老板加襪贈子子，自然也是『義送』，為何要『義送』？是因為那三百多孤軍，曾為保衛國土而死戰，曾為愛護國家而流血，而將來他們一定能够再度為國戰鬥。總之，是為了「救國」。</p>
<p>近兩月來，我曾「義賣一過」也曾「義送」過；但因瑣務紛繁，神思沉滯，加以寒熱，頭痛，不能好好地提起筆做「買賣』，所以不曾跟着『文化工作者義賣運動』，實在很覺慚愧。不過，我却曾為同學們所辦的刊物壁報之類，來過四五次文章『義送』。這樣來幾次『義賣』的『義送』，似乎與國無關，其實却有相當關係，——爲了特殊的影響，即使很小的部份的影響！</p>
<p>『義賣』是完全「献金」的，那末『義賣』的也當存一點「獻金」的心思，不要嫌那貨物的粗糙，應當慷慨地多挪出幾個錢來。</p>
<p>「義送」呢，送錢，送物，自然都好，但是送力，送精神，也未嘗不好。只要有利於抗戰建國，那末無論送什麼，無論送給誰，都是好的，像我這種入不敷出的人，老實說，雖然不能多多地送錢送物，不過，送力，送精神，當可以送下去的。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，許多的戰士，把血肉，把生命都送掉了，而貢献給國家。沒有喪生的後死者，以及有着多餘的力，多餘的精神，多餘的錢者，以及洪運亨通而發着抗戰財者，若還不肯「義送」，那還算是中國的國民，豈不慚愧！</p>
<p>所以，我主張「義賣」獻金的運動，固應擴大而持續，但進一步，更應把『義送』獻金，獻物，獻力，献精神的運動，加緊推行，擴大，而發揚之！</p>
<p>大家為了抗戰建國而起來『義賣』呀，「義送』呀！</p>
<h3>賣豆（上）</h3>
<p>— 明喆</p>
<p>—老奶奶的故事—</p>
<p>上面有命令下來，要我們去襲擊靑鎭。</p>
<p>本來，我們是以襲擊為事的，自然是應該進行。可是，王明源隊長，和其他幾個隊長，商量之下，却不免於躊躇，原因是我們不繞得靑鎭上的實情。不能作完備的佈置，所以便不能留然就去，我說，這事實還是只有請敎老奶奶。</p>
<p>我一想起老奶奶，大家都笑了開來，『好，馬上去請老奶奶來。』王明源說。</p>
<p>老奶奶不知正在作什麼，拍着衣裳從裏面出來了。</p>
<p>『靑鎮你很熟麼』？王明源問。</p>
<p>『很熱；』我有一個姨甥就住在那鎭上。』</p>
<p>『你知道現在靑鎭上有多少『人』多少槍，多少砲？』</p>
<p>『這個我却不知道。』</p>
<p>『你有方法知道麼？』</p>
<p>老奶奶想了一想，點點頭說，『有方法的；限我三天給回信，好不好？』</p>
<p>這樣說好之後，她宣去準備，似乎忙了一夜，明天，她一個人背了幾袋東西，就到了她的姨甥錢阿森的家裏。</p>
<p>她對阿錢森說，近來家裏零用錢一個都沒有，想到鎭上來作一些小買賣，她將布袋裏的東西倒了出來，錢阿森一看，原來是各種可吃的蠶豆，錢阿森並不以為意，因為這樣的事情，是眞正的鄉下老婦人所常幹的。</p>
<p>在明天一早，她向錢阿森借了一隻淺沿的大籃子，將各種豆放在裏面，就到街上去賣，她巳問明白，那些人所駐紮的地方是公大繭行，所以她就一直到那繭行對面的大茶樓上來。</p>
<p>她在茶樓上略略兜賣了二些蠶豆豆之後，就趦超地走到臨街的窓口來，遙矚着對面繭行的大門不走開。繭行門口有人站着岡，進進出出的人很多。她一目不瞬的注視着，似乎要找一個熱人樣于，有時有人喊她，豆也幾乎忘了。</p>
<p>「你這老友婆，為什麼生意不做，專門看着對面？」多閒的茶客中，有人這樣說。　（未完）</p>
<h3>石達開的真詩</h3>
<p>— 羅邕</p>
<p>五月十七日由自談裏，鄒嘯先生的『石達開的詩」，談及拙編太平天國詩文鈔，所以也來談上一談。</p>
<p>太平天國的翼干石達開，他的能詩善文，自然是串實，可是流傳下來的作品，十之八九，都是膺鼎。太平天國詩文鈔裏，收錄了他的文章，約五六篇。嚴格的說起來，只有頒給恩丞相楊福廣的職憑，確是眞蹟。不過這篇職憑，恐怕是幕府捉刀之作，也算不得是石達開親手作品。就是一兩篇從「賊」情彙纂裏鈔的論文，那不用說，也是眞　，不過同時，也正是幕府的作品。此外幾道文檄，拿太平天國的官制習慣來一考證，可以斷定是後人僞造之作品。就是那幾句著名的句子像「忍令上國衣冠，淪於夷狄：相率中原豪傑，還我河山」雖然激昂慷慨，就像梁啓超先生也被瞞過，加以稱許。其實仍舊是後人僞作，還不是石翼王的親手作品至於石達開的詩，從高天梅的石達開的詩鈔，至盧　野的石達開詩鈔，直至拙編詩文鈔，所搜羅的，雖然有多少的不同，但柳亞子先生寫給我的信，證明都出於高天梅先生所僞造。（就是那兩句有名的「我志未酬人巳苦，東南到處有啼痕，」也是僞造出來的。）這是最强有力的證據。從此可以說，我們向來所看到石達開的詩，鄱是後人偽作，沒有一首是眞的，（至於許指嚴潤色的石達開日記完全小說家言，不足置信，學者早有定評，無待　述。）如此說來，難道會做詩的石達開，眞沒有一首詩留傅下來麼，那也不盡然，石達開却有一首眞詩，到如今還大書深刻的留在廣西官山縣白龍洞的石壁上。這首詩是石達開未入川以前，遊覽白龍何時所作的，前面有石的序文，同他所作的五律一首，後面還有他的幕僚張遂謀等和詩十首，又楚南劉雲靑原詩一首，在這幾首詩以外，洞裏還有翼殿戶部尙書江右李嵐谷的巳未季秋遊白龍洞懷古的七古一首。以上的詩，都是民國二十六年六月裏，由宜山縣長陳輕馭先生精拓一份寄給我。外間雖有傳鈔，可是錯宇很多，我所依據的，却是原來的石刻，當然是靠得住的。可惜詩文鈔國難後四版本，業巳付印，不及收入，只好編在詩文鈔續篇裏。同時我現正着手寫的太平天國史人物傳，也依據了這些石刻，寫了一篇石翼王僚屬。現在將石達開的序文同詩，抄在後面，讓我們大家來膽仰一下民族英雄的眞作品。</p>
<p>序文道：「太平天國庚申十年，師駐慶遠。時於季春，予以政暇，偕諸大員，巡視芳郊。山川競秀，革木爭妍，登茲古洞，詩列琳瑯，韻著風雅。旋見粉牆劉雲靑句，寓意高超，出詞英俊，頗有斥佛息邪之概。予甚嘉之，爰命將其詩句勒石，以為世迷仙佛者警。予與諸員，亦就原韻，立賦數章，俱刊諸石，以誌游覽云。』詩日：『挺身登峻嶺，舉目照遙空。毀佛崇天帝，移民復古風。臨軍稱將勇，玩洞羨詩雄。劍氣冲星斗，文光射日虹。』</p>

        <h1>1939.05.24</h1>
<h3>The Rule of Law in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to an unreasonable oppression by × forces, four Shanghai newspapers have been severely penalized. The reasons for these penalties differ in their subject, their methods, their severity, and even in their stated justifications. The common factor is that all are vibrant Chinese-language newspapers operated by British and American businesses. Such a sweeping action is only seen in any country during periods of radical change in the national system, political system, or regime. In Shanghai, however, there is no precedent for this. Therefore, it cannot be assessed based on common sense or normal circumstances. Furthermore, these four newspapers are being penalized by formal public institutions; thus, they must be regarded as exercises of legal authority. On the other hand, whether these actions are political, administrative, or police-related, their nature is flexible. Whether they are legal or illegal, within or exceeding jurisdiction, appropriate or excessive, there must be principles to determine right and wrong, but a single perspective cannot be applied. Regardless of the nature of the penalty or whether it is right or wrong, once an issue has become a matter of legal authority, no private opinions or subjective emotions are allowed to be used to assess it before it is resolved according to the law, within the scope of legal authority, and after legal action has been taken. This is the realm of modern rule of law and freedom of speech, and no deviation is permitted. Regarding those four newspapers, they cause us extreme distress and almost suffocate us.</p>
<p>We respect the spirit of the rule of law and cannot advocate for the content of the cases when the four newspapers become legal cases. However, we must loudly call for the rule of law!</p>
<p>To discuss the rule of law in Shanghai is not to suggest that the Shanghai authorities have already acted in an unlawful or chaotic manner. Rather, Shanghai's situation seems to lead people to doubt whether rigidly adhering to established laws is sufficient to adapt to the environment. In this helpless situation, it seems that insisting on everything according to law is an unrealistic high ideal. Therefore, the only option is to seek extra-legal solutions through so-called understanding and cooperation. This kind of painstaking effort is sincerely understood by those who are enlightened. However, will the consequences be slightly better or worse? Those who believe in the rule of law must have a normal and clear answer to this question. What is difficult to answer is how to cope with the precarious present and how to avoid direct action and its associated disturbances and crises. The reason why truth and facts conflict lies in the fact that the very foundation of Shanghai is being shaken. However, if the foundation is shaken, wavering in faith is inevitable. In fact, if the foundation is shaken to the point of collapse, it cannot be saved by the rule of law. If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach? There is no law or governance to speak of. If one seeks governance by destroying the law, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Moreover, wavering in the belief in the rule of law will only exacerbate the shaking of the foundation. This is a truth that must align with reality.</p>
<p>As of today, regarding the fundamental issues of Shanghai, both the United States and the United Kingdom have issued clear statements, advocating that everything concerning Shanghai should be based on the Land Regulations. The Land Regulations are an international treaty, and based on the treaty is international rule of law. This kind of advocacy must be implemented in the most reasonable and thorough manner, and the shaking of Shanghai's foundation will inevitably return to stability as a result. With the foundation stable, not only should the rule of law be respected internally, but there is also a greater possibility of rigorously enforcing the rule of law. Therefore, we have a message for the authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement: up until today, all measures taken within the Settlement, whether trusted and appreciated or suspected and resented by residents of various countries within the Settlement, have not yet been subject to disputes about legality. Therefore, it is still easy to promote the rule of law and develop its spirit from today onward. The key is for the authorities to show everyone that they respect the rule of law and lead by example. Then, no one will dare to make extra-legal demands of the authorities. To show respect for the rule of law, the legal basis for each measure should be clearly explained to everyone, ensuring that everyone understands the legality of the measures and is happy to accept the rule of law. For example, the case of the four newspapers is unprecedented in Shanghai, and therefore requires explanation.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Base Area Government in Southeastern Shanxi</h3>
<p>— Ke Han</p>
<p>(Special Contribution) The Anti-Japanese base area in Southeastern Shanxi includes nineteen counties that are often maintained complete and twenty-three incomplete counties. The majority of these incomplete counties are located on the Tongpu Railway Line, with half of their territory in western Shanxi and the other half in Southeastern Shanxi. This vast area is home to five million people, accounting for one-third of the thirteen million people in all of Shanxi. Economically, it is the wealthiest area in all of Shanxi. Geographically, it is shielded by the Taihang Mountains to the east and the Taiyue Mountains to the west, with the Xicheng, Wangwu, Lutai, Zhongtiao, and Bafu ranges surrounding it to the north and south. The surrounding mountains provide an ideal location for establishing an anti-Japanese base area. Furthermore, due to the high elevation of the Taihang Mountains, it can control Hebei and Shandong provinces to the east. The terrain also makes it the anti-Japanese base area among the anti-Japanese base areas. Today, the general command post for guerrilla warfare in North China is located here. This vast area is also the first line of defense for protecting the Great Northwest. As the ancient saying goes, "He who gains Shangdang gains the world." Shangdang is Southeastern Shanxi, centered on Changzhi (formerly known as Luanfu), and the world, of course, is Central Plains of Henan.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Fen, the entire Southeastern Shanxi has been transferred to × rear area. Since then, Southeastern Shanxi has made rapid and substantial progress in all aspects of construction, including military, political, economic, cultural and educational, and people's movement, creating unprecedented prosperity and vigorous atmosphere in the history of Southeastern Shanxi. Everyone who comes to North China × rear area for inspection is willing to visit Southeastern Shanxi first. In the recent period, it has attracted many Chinese and foreign reporters, literary workers, photographers, and artists. They organized war zone news service teams, visiting groups, and inspection teams, preparing to introduce everything they saw and heard in Southeastern Shanxi to the whole country and the world. They also brought cameras to film every moving scene, preparing to take them back to the rear for screening. Indeed, everything in Southeastern Shanxi is ordinary, but it is new and fresh when people consider that this is in × rear area.</p>
<p>Each aspect in Southeastern Shanxi has its own significant progress, and the most important progress is the enlightened local government. The progress of the political structure in Southeastern Shanxi not only promoted progress in other aspects and constituted the main reason for the progress of other aspects, but also promoted the political progress of the entire Shanxi. Today, the progress in other areas of Shanxi is not as much influenced by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region as it is influenced by Southeastern Shanxi.</p>
<p>The highest administrative organs responsible for leading Southeastern Shanxi are mainly the Commissioner's Offices of the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions. The commissioner of the Third Administrative Region is Mr. Bo Yibo, and the commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region is Mr. Rong Zihe (Wu Sheng). They are both relatively progressive and enlightened figures under the leadership of Commander Yan. They manage nineteen complete counties and several incomplete counties. The former's governing area is in the north, shielding the × people on the Zhengtai Road. The latter's governing area is in the south, with its main gateway being Dongyangguan. The other twenty or so counties on the Tongpu Railway Line, which only have half of their area, are centered on Hongtong and are under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Administrative Region. South of Hongtong to the Yellow River, the Seventh Administrative Region governs. The Commissioner's Offices are located west of the Tongpu Road, while their offices are established east of the road, close to the railway. Below the Commissioner's Offices, an organized administrative system is arranged from the county to the village in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Today, aside from the government's achievements in maintaining social order, raising huge amounts of financial and economic supplies for the Death Squads, guerrilla teams, and all local armed forces, implementing national defense education, and mobilizing the people to participate in the war, let alone, in terms of the administrative structure itself, it has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>First, the political power is unified, with unified leadership and unified work steps. This means not only that the local political power in Southeastern Shanxi is unified under the leadership of the central government and Commander Yan, but also that Southeastern Shanxi itself is unified in terms of political power. The two main highest administrative organs in Southeastern Shanxi, the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions, have close ties with each other. Commissioners Bo Yibo and Rong Zihe not only consult on everything and share the same opinions, but also organized an Administrative Joint Conference, which is held regularly once a month to discuss and arrange the administrative work in Southeastern Shanxi. Therefore, the pace of administrative work is uniform, and the leadership style is consistent. The establishment of this regular joint conference has not been long, it was decided at the conference supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but today we can already see its effectiveness. Recently, the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions' work arrangements for welcoming × new offensive have the same basic policies and work, except for some differences due to different specific circumstances. In particular, everyone put forward the same slogans in terms of working methods. The unification of leadership and the unification of work steps will enable the administrative organs to exert their effectiveness even more, and will enable the administrative work to be carried out even more smoothly in the future. Originally, the unification of administrative and military command in the × rear area is equally important, because many problems, such as financial and economic problems and the system of trade control, can only be done more satisfactorily and reasonably with a unified policy, unified steps, and mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>The organizational form of the Administrative Joint Conference has not been found anywhere else, but it is indeed the best form for achieving unity and contact in work under the leadership of different local administrative officials. This is the first characteristic of the Southeastern Shanxi regime.</p>
<p>Second, it is the implementation of democratic politics. In Shanxi, democracy was quickly proposed by Commander Yan. Before the War of Resistance, Commander Yan advocated the will of the people supervising the government, but it was not valued by the local administrative personnel at that time and was not fully utilized. Only Southeastern Shanxi is making efforts to implement democratic politics today. As of the time the reporter wrote this article, three-quarters of the village chiefs and vice chiefs in the Third Administrative Region were elected by the villagers' congress. In the Fifth Administrative Region, two-thirds of the village chiefs and vice chiefs were elected. In some places, even district chiefs and office managers are elected. This is an outstanding achievement in the national scope. Enlightened administrative officials are more willing to gradually progress to the point where county magistrates can also be elected by the people.</p>
<p>They not only give the people this real right to vote and be elected, but also give the people the indirect right of recall. Administrative organs can respect the will of the people as much as possible, and humbly consider and accept the opinions of the masses. In the past, when the reporter first arrived in Southeastern Shanxi, the administrative organs in the Fifth Administrative Region still contained some corrupt elements left over from the past. They did not care about the interests of the people, and even suppressed the people, hindering the development of the people's movement, causing the people's disgust and opposition. Therefore, petitions from the people to the higher-level governments occurred frequently. For example, the people of Lingchuan and Gaoping counties gathered thousands of people to trek to the Changzhi Commissioner's Office to submit petitions. When such a petition movement occurs, administrative officials will definitely come out of the "government gate": they will meet them outside the gate, then give them a comforting speech, and invite their representatives to stay and await his response to the issue. When they investigate and find that their subordinates have indeed committed illegal and bad deeds as accused by the people, they will immediately replace the accused without mercy. These concrete facts of truly understanding the people's sentiments and accepting the people's opinions have improved the people's attention to and concern for the government. In Southeastern Shanxi, there is a popular saying among the people: "Now it's different. Ordinary people can also come out and say a word!" Indeed, how many times in thousands of years have the people of Shanxi had such an opportunity to stand up and speak!</p>
<p>The government also gives the people the opportunity to participate in politics. This is the establishment of the administrative conference. When this organization was established, local administrative officials openly stated to the people that this was the preparation for the local councils. The councils at all levels in Shanxi should have been established in January of this year according to the decision of the Central National Political Council, but due to various difficulties, they have not yet been established. The local government in Southeastern Shanxi then temporarily replaced the local councils with administrative conferences. Administrative conferences have been organized in both the administrative region and various counties. The county magistrate serves as the chairman of each county's administrative conference. In addition, the representatives participating in the administrative conference are divided into two types: representatives of people's organizations and representatives elected by popular vote from the districts. The representatives of the administrative conference include two representatives from the Sacrifice to Save the Nation League, two from the Gongzhantuan, three from the Farmers' Salvation Association, and two each from the Workers' Salvation, Youth Salvation, Women's Salvation, and Education Salvation Associations, and three representatives from the gentry. District representatives are elected by popular vote from each district, three from each district. In order to improve the status of women, it is also stipulated that among the three representatives elected from each district, at least one must be a female representative. Within the scope of the Fifth Administrative Region, there are many ethnic minorities - Hui people - in Changzhi, Jincheng, and Changzi. Therefore, it is also specially stipulated that areas with a certain number of Hui residents should have Hui representatives participating in the administrative conference. Therefore, Hui compatriots have expressed such emotions: "Only in Southeastern Shanxi can the Hui people be so valued by the Han people." The administrative conference is invisibly the highest organization for deciding local administration. Through the administrative conference, the people can review and criticize the work of the government, and put forward opinions to discuss, study, and decide on the government's administrative policies. The administrative conference is also an organization for the government and the people to directly contact each other. The government's decisions can be conveyed to the people through the representatives of the administrative conference, so that the people can understand the government's will and sincerely implement the government's resolutions and support the government. The will of the people can also be reflected to the government through the representatives of the administrative conference. In the administrative conferences held in various counties, they often closed with enthusiastic shouts of slogans and cheers. Their slogans mainly supported the government and supported ××× county magistrate. The reason is that the county magistrate accepted their criticisms and adopted their opinions in the meeting. The administrative conference brought the government and the people closer together.</p>
<p>Implementing democratic politics is the second characteristic of politics in Southeastern Shanxi, and also the greatest advantage.</p>
<p>Third, is the attention to improving people's livelihoods. A long time ago, the local government in Southeastern Shanxi promulgated the "two-five reduction of rent, five-one reduction of interest" decrees, and these decrees have been widely implemented in Southeastern Shanxi, with preliminary results. Due to the cruel ravages of the × invasion of Southeastern Shanxi in nine routes, Southeastern Shanxi has generated many victims of the disaster. In addition to those released by the central government, the government also pays special attention to the work of relieving the victims of the disaster. In this regard, special relief committees have been established in various counties to raise funds to be distributed to various places. It is estimated that each county assists more than 300 disaster victims every day. The administrative authorities also put forward slogans: "If people starve to death in the village, the village chief is responsible. If people starve to death in the district, the district chief is responsible. If people starve to death in the county, the county magistrate is responsible." Under this slogan, the phenomenon of starvation has indeed never occurred, and local governments at all levels are working diligently to rescue victims. At the same time, they also advocated the method of "villages saving villages," which has had a great effect. However, this is only the negative aspect. On the other hand, the government has also established low-interest loan offices in various villages, implementing small-scale lending, and creating cooperative societies and small-scale handicraft factories to relieve unemployment. The capital of low-interest loan offices is usually around one hundred yuan, but relying on this one hundred yuan, many poor and helpless people have the opportunity to earn a living. The Lunar New Year is coming soon, and the Shangdang Bank has specially allocated tens of thousands of yuan for low-interest loans. I have never seen a local government pay so much attention to the lives of the people. This concern for people's livelihoods has greatly increased the people's goodwill towards the government, making the people sincerely think that today's government is indeed their own government. At the same time, the improvement of people's livelihoods has mobilized the people one after another.</p>
<p>Fourth, is the improvement and strengthening of the administrative structure itself. This can also be divided into two aspects: one is the structure itself, and the other is the allocation of talent.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, governments at all levels have become powerful organizations. In the past, the county government only had three sections: administration, finance, and education. Now, it has added two sections: people's movement and armed forces. The addition of these two sections allows the government to not only manage general local administrative work, but also have organs to mobilize and arm the people, and to focus on leadership and actively exert the power of the government to make the government's structure suitable for wartime leadership.

<h3>Recent Developments in Our Country's Education and Culture</h3>
<p>Continued from yesterday</p>
<p>Implementing Policies for Prostitutes</p>
<p>(6) Promoting Adult Education for Prostitutes: Recently, there have been frequent reports about prostitutes saving the nation. Therefore, it is necessary to promote education among them to enhance their conviction in resisting the enemy. Liuzhou Special District currently has 133 prostitutes, and it is planned to divide them into three classes and assign personnel to teach them. (7) Performance Evaluation: In every village and street, all men and women between the ages of 18 and 45 should learn as adults. Without hindering their daily work, they should attend classes for two hours each day (men and women taught separately). They will graduate in two months, and the government will issue graduation certificates. Textbooks will be provided by the government. Those with excellent graduation results will be selected by the county government at the end of this year's adult classes, ranging from five to twenty people, and will be awarded bonuses or certificates to encourage them. Those who refuse to attend school or fail to supervise effectively will be punished according to the provincial regulations, depending on the severity. Following the steps outlined above, the county government will supervise the townships, the townships will supervise the villages and streets, and the villages and streets will encourage the masses to actively enroll in school. With this level-by-level effort, I believe that the 18,767 illiterate people in Liuzhou can be eliminated within this year.</p>
<p>Overseas Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Investigates and Statistics General Situations from the Past</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The situation of Chinese overseas education has recently been thoroughly investigated and statistically analyzed by the Ministry of Education. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Evolution of Overseas Study: China officially began sending students abroad in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, selecting young children to go to the United States. In the first year of the Guangxu reign, four groups of 120 people were sent. Later, due to disagreements between the minister and the supervisor, the students were recalled in the seventh year of the Guangxu reign. It was not until the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign that 13 government-sponsored students were sent to Japan. In the twenty-fourth year, Zhang Zhidong sent 30 students to Japan to study military affairs. Since then, students have been sent every year, and the number of self-funded students has also increased. At that time, there were as many as 15,000 students in Japan. In the thirty-first year, the Japanese side planned to promulgate regulations to restrict foreign students. The students strongly opposed this and returned to China one after another, and the number of people decreased sharply. However, the rules were not promulgated, and many went to Japan again to resume their studies. At this time, very few students were sent to study in the West, and there were very few self-funded students. In the thirty-third year, the Qing government announced the purpose of education and sent the education commissioners of various provinces to Japan to study the preparations for learning. The Ministry of Education and the Japanese Ministry of Education signed a special agreement for five schools, and the number of students sent to Japan by the provinces was limited. After the Xinhai Revolution, almost all the students in Japan returned to China to participate in the revolutionary movement. Since the United States returned the Boxer Indemnity and established Tsinghua School, more and more students have been going to Europe and the United States. In the 14th year of the Republic, Tsinghua was changed to a university, and the method of sending all students to the United States was stopped. Instead, a general examination method was adopted. According to statistics, the school had sent more than 1,900 students successively. The number of students sent by various provinces also increased. After the first year of the Republic, the number of students in Japan fluctuated. In the fourth year of the Republic, Japan forced the Twenty-One Demands, and the students in Japan were enraged and returned to China. In the 13th year of the Republic, China and Japan signed the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement, and a quota for the Boxer Indemnity subsidy was established. The number of students in Japan increased year by year. Although the Ministry of Education decided to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement in the 19th year, there was still an increase in the number of students going to Japan.</p>
<p>Among the European countries, France has the largest number of Chinese students, especially after the European War, the number of students working and studying frugally increased sharply to a peak of 1,600. Later, with the establishment of the Sino-French University in Lyon, it became more convenient to study in France. In the 14th and 15th years of the Republic, Soviet Russia established Sun Yat-sen University. At that time, the Guangdong government sent students to study in Russia, but this was soon stopped. In the 21st year of the Republic, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Repayment Committee annually set a quota for government-funded students in the UK, and the committee separately selected students through examinations. This has been done for six sessions.</p>
<p>Management of Overseas Studies: Regarding the management of overseas studies, two supervisors were assigned to the young students sent to the United States in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign. In fact, they were overseas study supervisors. The dispatch of students to Japan was initially mostly entrusted to Japanese to be responsible for education and management. In the third year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education sent one supervisor, and each province sent one or several managers, or several provinces sent one manager, to manage the affairs of students in Japan. In the fourth year of the Republic, supervisors were set up to manage students in Europe, but the affairs of students in Russia were still managed by the embassy in Russia. In the fifth year of the Republic, supervisors were set up to manage students in the United States. After the establishment of the National Government, the supervision of students in Japan was still being established, until it was temporarily cancelled after the outbreak of the War of Resistance. The supervision of students in Europe and the United States has ceased to be set up.</p>
<p>Qualifications for Overseas Study: Chinese students going abroad to study should be limited to those who cannot receive appropriate guidance and equipment in China and are needed by the country. Before the 21st year of the Republic, foreign students only needed to have a high school degree or above in China. Since the promulgation of regulations in the 22nd year, the qualifications have been raised. "Government-funded students" must have one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of public or registered private colleges or universities in China or abroad, and have held technical positions related to the subject of study for more than two years. (2) Graduates of public or registered private colleges or universities in China or abroad who have continued to study the subject for more than two years and have valuable specialized works or other achievements. (3) Graduates of public or registered private universities or independent colleges in China or abroad with excellent grades. "Self-funded students" must have one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of public or registered private colleges or universities. (2) Graduates of public or registered private senior vocational schools who have held technical positions in China for more than two years.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Overseas Study: In recent years, the Ministry of Education has tightened the selection of government-funded students, and the subjects of study are mostly agreed upon in advance with the dispatching agencies. In addition to raising qualifications for self-funded students going abroad, most provinces have scholarships to subsidize self-funded students with excellent grades. Students studying abroad must submit research results on time, and after returning to China, they must submit credentials to the Ministry of Education and apply for registration. All these regulations make the management of students more strict than before. The subjects studied by students are mainly practical subjects such as science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine for government-funded students. This principle has been followed for several years, and the number of self-funded students studying practical subjects has also increased year by year.</p>
<p>Number of Students Studying Abroad: Taking the recent ten years (from the 18th year to the 27th year) as an example, there were a total of 7,545 people, including 6,781 self-funded students and 764 government-funded students. Government-funded students accounted for about one-ninth of the number of self-funded students. In terms of each year, the 18th year had the largest number of self-funded students (1,568) because the regulations on qualifications for studying abroad were looser at that time, so more people went abroad. The 27th year had the least (33), which was due to the restrictions on studying abroad due to the war. The 23rd year had the largest number of government-funded students (141) because it was the construction period, so more government-funded students were selected. The 27th year had the fewest (26), which was also due to the restrictions on studying abroad. In terms of country, the United States had the most government-funded students (319), followed by the United Kingdom (220). Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands had the fewest. Except for Japan (before the war), the United States also had the most self-funded students (526), followed by France. The Netherlands had the fewest. Over the past ten years (from the 18th year to the 27th year), a total of 597 students (including 220 government-funded) received overseas study certificates in the UK, 600 in Germany (82 government-funded), 706 in France (34 government-funded), 188 in Belgium (13 government-funded), 24 in Italy (2 government-funded), 40 in Sweden and Switzerland (2 government-funded), 25 in Austria (self-funded), 6 in Denmark (2 government-funded), 3 in the Netherlands (2 government-funded), 1,845 in the United States (319 government-funded), 14 in Canada (self-funded), 3,483 in Japan (84 government-funded), 10 in Egypt (self-funded), 3 in India (self-funded), 12 in the Philippines (self-funded), and 16 in other countries (4 government-funded). In total, 7,545 people studied abroad in the past ten years, including 764 government-funded students and 6,781 self-funded students.</p>
<p>External Culture</p>
<p>Participating in International Conferences and Promoting Cooperative Undertakings</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) China's participation in the League of Nations' cultural undertakings dates back to the 19th year of the Republic. Recently, the League of Nations initiated the revision of the International Convention on Cultural Cooperation to make cultural cooperation among countries closer. The League of Nations obtained China's consent and invited Li Shizeng to represent China in formally signing the convention in Paris in December of the 27th year. After the signing of this convention, the exchange of cultural undertakings and information among the member countries will be more convenient, which will be especially beneficial to China. The Ministry of Education's past cooperation with international cultural affairs is summarized below:</p>
<p>Participating in International Academic Conferences</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the important international academic conferences in which China participated included the International Public Education Conference, the International Art History Conference, the International Dialect Conference, the General Assembly of the International Committee on Cultural Cooperation, the International Religious Conference, and the French Descartes Conference. After attending the conferences, all representatives submitted written reports, which were forwarded by the Ministry of Education to relevant agencies and organizations for reference. During the War of Resistance, external publicity was particularly important. China participated in a total of seven international academic conferences: (1) The 13th International Congress on the Protection of Children in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in June of the 27th year, attended by Xu Ze, a secretary of the embassy in Germany. (2) The International Congress of Philosophy, Science, and General Culture in Mexico in June of last year, attended by personnel from the embassy in Mexico. (3) The Seventh International Conference on Education in Geneva in July of last year, attended by Xie Shoukang. (4) The International Technical Education Conference in Berlin in July of last year, attended by Xie Shoukang. (5) The Second World Youth Congress in New York, USA, in August of last year, attended by a Chinese delegation of 29 people. (6) The Eighth International Congress of Historical Sciences in Switzerland in August of the 7th year, attended by Hu Shi. (7) The 20th World Oriental Studies Conference in Beijing in September of last year, attended by Xie Shoukang.</p>
<p>Selecting and Exchanging Students</p>
<p>In the spring of the 25th year, the Polish government requested the Chinese government to select a student to study in Poland, with the tuition and accommodation fees subsidized by Poland and the round-trip travel expenses subsidized by the Ministry of Education. The request was accepted, and Fang Fusen, an assistant teacher in the School of Engineering of Tsinghua University, was selected to study road engineering. He will soon complete his studies and return to serve the country. In the 16th year, the Ministry of Education, at the request of the German International Academic Exchange Office, decided to jointly organize the exchange of students between China and Germany. In the first year, it was decided to exchange six students first. The exchange schools in China were Central University, Peking University, Wuhan University, Jiaotong University, and Shanghai Medical College. In Germany, the International Academic Exchange Office was responsible for the arrangement. After the approval of the exchange of students between the two countries, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, which affected the start date of the school. Therefore, the German students coming to China were temporarily postponed, and only a few Chinese students went to Germany. In addition, Italy also requested to exchange students with China and sent students to China.</p>
<p>Establishing International Cultural Organizations</p>
<p>In order to promote cultural relations between China and foreign countries, the Ministry of Education has successively approved the establishment of cultural associations such as the Sino-British, Sino-Polish, Sino-German, and Sino-Soviet associations, organized by Chinese and foreign academics, and provided guidance and supervision at any time. The important work of each association over the years includes the selection and sending of interns by the China-America Cultural Association, the exchange of Sino-British lectures, the publication of Sino-Soviet culture and other publications by the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the holding of film exhibitions and book exhibitions, the establishment of the Soviet Union Research Committee, the exchange of students by the Sino-Polish and Sino-German cultural associations, and the publication of introductions. These not only promote cultural ties between the two countries but also benefit the friendship between the two countries. In addition, in order to uphold the purposes and policies of the League of Nations, the League of Nations Association, which was previously established in Peiping by Chinese academics, also moved south in the winter of the 24th year, improved its organization, and continued to operate. The association has been actively engaged in upholding the League of Nations in the past two years and has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Exchanging International Publications</p>
<p>China officially joined the International Convention for the Exchange of Publications in the 14th year of the Republic. The Ministry of Education's International Exchange Office for Publications is currently in charge of the matter. In the 25th year, 36 countries joined the exchange agreement, and in the 26th year, Queensland, Latvia, and El Salvador were added, totaling 39 countries. There are also non-official exchange countries that exchange publications through the office, including Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and various territories, totaling dozens of locations. In the two years before the war, the number of items exchanged by the office at home and abroad was: (1) 246 boxes and 237 packages of books received from various countries and transferred to domestic agencies; (2) 73 boxes and 16,729 packages of paintings received from domestic agencies and transferred to various countries; (3) 113 boxes and 859 packages of books and documents sent to various countries; (4) 111 boxes and 5,600 packages of books and documents sent to domestic agencies. In addition, during the War of Resistance, the number of items exchanged by the office at home and abroad was: (1) 77 boxes and 28 packages of books and documents received from various countries and transferred to domestic agencies; (2) 538 packages of books and documents sent to foreign agencies; (3) 4 boxes and 10 packages of books and documents received from domestic agencies and transferred to various countries; (4) 3 boxes and 1,560 packages of books and documents sent to foreign agencies. In addition, the Chinese Institute of the University of Frankfurt in Germany is still subsidized by China with 5,000 yuan annually, and the Chinese Institute has been established at the International University of India with the support of China. In the future, if the funding for international cultural undertakings can be increased, the cultural cooperation between China and other countries will be gradually expanded. The Chinese International Art Exhibition held in London, England, has enabled Europeans and Americans to have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and enhance China's international status.</p>

<h3>Our Army in Northern Hubei Advances Victoriously Riding the Momentum; The Enemy Admits That the Invasion of Xiangfan Has Failed; Chen Cheng Returns from the Front Lines to Discuss the War Situation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 22nd] Our army in northern Hubei is still attacking Suizhou, which is very smooth. The enemy is resisting stubbornly with reinforcements, and the battle situation is fierce. The remnants of the enemy in the Dabie Mountains are under our siege and suppression. The enemy in Changshoudian, Zhongxiang, and Fangjiaji Huangpilong is attempting to cross the Xiang River, which we are strictly guarding against. In recent days, we have been attacking Fangjiaji and the southwest of Changshoudian, and the fierce battle with the enemy is intense. A part of the enemy is counterattacking Fengle River, and we are severely attacking them.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] General Chen Cheng has returned to this place yesterday after inspecting various lines. When he met with reporters, he said that since the abandonment of Wuhan, the Japanese army has not gained any military victory except for the capture of Nanchang, and the Chinese army has instead taken the initiative. In the vicinity of Nanchang, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Since the end of last month, the Japanese army has encountered a counterattack from the Chinese army in Gao'an and Wuyu, suffering heavy casualties. Although the Chinese army has not won any major victories, it has been enough to contain the Japanese army and prevent the transfer of troops from other fronts to attack Hubei Province. Now, the transportation on the Nanchang-Xunyang route has been cut off by the Chinese army, and the two highways south of Nanchang are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Various goods can enter the interior from the coast. He also said that there are currently about three and a half divisions of the Japanese army in Hubei Province. With such a small number of troops, it is impossible to threaten the Chinese army. All the Japanese troops in China, totaling about 33 divisions, still feel insufficient. It is not that they cannot make an offensive plan, but that they are unable to control the occupied areas for a long time. Finally, General Chen said that although there is no start to the recovery of large cities, this is due to strategic relations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] News from Shanghai: According to the Japanese military authorities, it was reported today that the Japanese army, which advanced in northern Hubei and southern Henan in early May, has now retreated to its original positions south of the Dabie Mountains. According to a spokesman, the reason for the Japanese army's retreat is that the Chinese army is numerous and cannot be defeated by a small number of troops. Moreover, the terrain in the area is easy to defend, and the Japanese army's transportation of military supplies is also quite difficult due to the active Chinese army.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin, This Newspaper, 23rd] At the beginning of this month, General Zhang Fakui personally visited Jinhua and held an important military meeting with Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaoxiong, Liu Jianxu, Gu Zhutong, Tang Shengzhi, etc. Many important cases were resolved. Among them, it was specifically decided to simultaneously launch offensives in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong provinces to contain a large number of Japanese soldiers, so that they could not be transferred to other battlefields. Important instructions were also given on the anti-Japanese deployment in the southeastern provinces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 23rd] At 1:30 pm on the 22nd, 12 enemy planes in four batches spied on Qujiang Wengyuan. Nine planes dropped dozens of bombs near Yutou Village, southwest of Qingyuan, destroying more than ten houses and injuring several villagers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 23rd] At noon on the 22nd, dozens of enemy soldiers in Taipingchang advanced towards Mayazhuang from Hejiapu and Bohe in the northwest. They were severely attacked by our troops, and the enemy immediately fled back to their original route.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 23rd] About 3,000 enemies in Woqu, southern Shanxi, launched an attack on us in two groups at dawn on the 1st, under the cover of planes and artillery. Our capable troops have divided up to meet them.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Turn Against the Enemy One After Another</p>
<p>[Pingbao News Agency, Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 20th] Nanhe in Hebei Province was severely attacked by us and retreated into the city. We recovered Haojiaqiao. After the entire unit of Xu Bingli, the battalion commander of the guard of the puppet army Li Ying, turned against the enemy, the authorities gave a reward of 10,000 yuan and reorganized them. Many puppet soldiers are contacting us to turn against the enemy, and the entire enemy formation is shaking.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 22nd] The enemy in Laiwu, Shandong Province, invaded the south and was repelled by us, killing more than 100 enemies. Yesterday, our guerrillas attacked the Jiaoji Railway, Weixian County, and Qingzhou, and captured many prisoners.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Oppression of Foreign Merchants in China Is Increasing; Restricting the Navigation of Foreign Ships Along Our Coast; Using Customs to Coerce Foreign Ships to Obtain Permits from the Enemy; The British Authorities Attach Great Importance to This</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 23rd, 11:15 AM] Mr. Lida, the acting deputy tax commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, stated to foreign officials that after next Thursday (June 1st), all foreign ships sailing along the coast of China must carry a permit from the Japanese Navy; otherwise, they will be subject to arrest by the Japanese Navy. However, Mr. Lida, as a Chinese customs official, has no right to make this statement. According to Mr. Lida, this matter was decided by the Japanese authorities, and the reason is military necessity. After June 1st, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs will not issue customs export permits to ships sailing to other coasts of China unless the ships obtain permits from the Japanese Navy. The enemy authorities have announced the blockade of 11 Chinese ports, including the ports currently still in Chinese hands. However, it has not been stated whether the ports in South China are included.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 23rd] A Japanese spokesman in Shanghai said that the foreign ships that will be required to obtain Japanese Navy permits in the future will be limited to those exporting from Shanghai, and the Japanese side's exercise of this right is based on the occupation rights of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Blockade to be Implemented on June 1st</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 23rd] Shanghai Jianghai Customs officials refused to formally criticize the declaration issued by the Japanese tax commissioner, but still confirmed that the Japanese Navy's blockade action will be implemented from June 1st. Personnel from the British Embassy have learned that the Japanese Navy's new method is actually intended to be implemented only through one port in China. The British authorities are currently investigating in order to make representations to Tokyo. As far as is known at present, British ships are also among those being restricted. Therefore, before leaving certain designated ports, they must first obtain a permit from the Japanese Navy. It is believed that British ships and ships of other countries will not be able to obtain customs export permits without a permit from the Japanese Navy. Jianghai Customs has agreed to announce the names of the Chinese ports subject to the above-mentioned restrictions within a few days.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Consulate in Hong Kong Still Denies It</h3>
<p>[Foreign News from Hong Kong] Mr. Tajiri, the acting consul general of the enemy in Hong Kong, told a reporter from the Hong Kong China Mail yesterday that the news was strange and that he did not believe that such a declaration had been issued. He said that he had not received any information about such measures even in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong naval authorities have also not received any news. A British Navy spokesman said, "If the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have issued this order, the Japanese authorities should also send it to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai. However, we have not heard of this matter yet." According to a Chinese customs official here, Mr. Li has no right to issue this announcement on behalf of the Chinese Customs. After this news spread to Hong Kong, the shipping industry here was very surprised, because (1) it would undermine the administrative power of the Chinese Customs, (2) it would violate international law, and (3) it would seize and harm the interests of third countries in China. Although the shipping industry here has not yet obtained detailed information, it is learned that British merchant ships are also among those being restricted, along with other foreign merchant ships. It is heard that the British authorities in China are currently investigating the matter.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Shanghai: The Japanese yen continued to fall in Shanghai this morning. One hundred yen can only be exchanged for an average of 89 and a half Chinese legal currency. In some exchange shops, one Japanese yen can only be exchanged for 88 cents of legal currency.</p>
<p>Lihua: The members of the western route of the Sichuan-Xikang Inspection Group left Lihua on the 17th to go to Yajiang. The citizens held tea to see them off for more than ten miles in the suburbs. The grand occasion was unseen in thirty years.</p>
<h3>The Commanders of the Four-Nation Fleet Discuss the Gulangyu Incident; The Enemy's Consul in Xiamen Protests to the Local Consulate Corps</h3>
<p>[News from Hong Kong] Yesterday (23rd), the Hong Kong China Mail reported, "This (23rd) morning, the naval commanders of the four nations, Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, held a round table meeting on the Japanese army's occupation of the Gulangyu International Settlement on board a battleship. The British representative was Admiral Noble, the commander-in-chief of the China Fleet; the French representative was Admiral Badant, the commander-in-chief of the Asia Fleet; the Japanese representative was Admiral Shiozawa, the commander-in-chief of the South China Fleet; and the American representative was Admiral Stapler, the commander-in-chief of the South China Cruiser Fleet. This meeting was probably of a secret nature, so there were no reports published on its actual situation. As for the soldiers of the four nations, they are still patrolling within the Gulangyu International Settlement." Also, Uchida, the Japanese consul general in Xiamen, protested to the local consular corps (on the 23rd), saying that the landing of the navies of Britain, France, and the United States was an unfriendly move. Given the previous situation of Gulangyu, his request for the three countries to withdraw their troops was reasonable. As for "the Japanese side's request for the Gulangyu Municipal Council to employ Japanese staff, it is also because Japan hopes for the peace and prosperity of the international settlement, similar to the situation in Xiamen." Uchida also drew the attention of the consular corps, saying that the number of Japanese troops landed had been reduced on the 15th of this month. As soon as the investigation of the murder case of Mr. Hong Lidong, the chairman of the former Japanese Commercial Association, is stepped up, Japan is also planning to completely withdraw its landing troops.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Enemy Buys Over Traitors to Deceive the Villagers</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin, This Newspaper, 23rd] The Guangdong enemy is using a policy of appeasement to buy over the ignorant people. The Guangzhou enemy has set up a civil servant and refugee job placement office, recruiting unemployed vagrants and sending them to various townships to establish lower-level township organizations. The big and small traitors in Guangzhou are extremely active in dreaming of establishing a puppet "Republic of China."</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan, This Newspaper, 23rd] According to visitors from the interior, the South China enemy military authorities have no confidence in military victories, so they ordered all the puppet organizations under their wing to issue a joint declaration, advocating "peace." The declaration is widely circulated in the occupied areas, but the general public is indifferent to it. Also, recent enemy propaganda rarely boasts about war achievements, which shows that the enemy is actually taking a defensive position and unable to make progress.</p>
<h3>Unrest in the Tianjin Concession; The Enemy's Consul Makes New Demands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Peiping, 23rd] According to the Tianjin puppet organization's newspaper, the Japanese military authorities here have made new demands to the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council, including the British Municipal Council employing Qing and Japanese advisors, and joint searches for terrorists by the British and Japanese police, and the surrender of those arrested to the Japanese authorities. The newspaper also claimed that the Japanese military authorities are plotting three things: (1) ordering the Peiping puppet government to come forward and take over the Tianjin concessions; (2) the Japanese military supervising the administration of the concessions; (3) surrounding the concessions in a big way to first reduce their importance.</p>

The × side's military had previously sent a warship led by Major General Kageza to Haiphong to welcome Wang, and arranged a residence for Wang in the Broadway Mansions in Shanghai. Also, Wang recently flew to Fukuoka on a × plane, then transferred to Tokyo. Gao Zongwu accompanied him. After arriving, he immediately met with Hiranuma, and then met with the Japanese Emperor. It is heard that the × government has approved the secret agreement between Wang and Hiranuma.

<p>【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd】Shanghai News: Wang's associates are vigorously wooing the education circles for Wang and using secret groups to recruit people everywhere, but without success.

<h3>× Plots to Use Religion to Numb People's Hearts; Sends Ronin to Various Places to Carry Out Activities; American Church People Determined to Reject Unanimously</h3>
<p>【Central News Agency, This Celebratory 23rd】Shanghai News: In order to intensify its cultural aggression against our country, × previously sent many idle ronin, posing as Christian teachers, attempting to convene a meeting in Shanghai and engage in incitement. Fortunately, their treachery was discovered by the foreign missionaries in China, who unanimously rejected them and refused to associate with them. ×'s plan failed, and they disappeared for a time, not daring to show their faces. Unexpectedly, ×'s ambition is not dead, and recently they have been plotting to attack the American churches in China separately, outwardly showing contact, but secretly plotting to disrupt, in order to infiltrate the × side's influence into the American churches, so as to undermine the confidence of the American churches in our country's people, in order to achieve the purpose of numbing and deceiving them. It is learned that the × military department has dispatched Saburo Yasumura of the National Christian Youth Association of that country to Shanghai to plan and preside over, and has dispatched three pastors to North China and three to Central China to actively carry out activities and implement the conspiracy. However, the American church people in China have always advocated justice and are especially sympathetic to our resistance against the war. It is heard that they have unanimously decided to continue their consistent policy, oppose ×'s cultural aggression policy, and have sent letters to churches in various places, strictly guarding against associating with × slaves.</p>
<p>【Special Telegram from Guangzhou Bay, This War, 23rd】The Nanhai Xingye Company, sponsored by the × side, has been mining phosphorous ore on Hainan Island and manufacturing fertilizer. However, most of the phosphorous ore is located inland on the island. The × soldiers are weak and dare not go deep into the area. Our guerrillas are also extremely active. The × people know that it is difficult to win by force, so they are promoting Buddhism in order to numb the local people on our island.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Mobile Strategy, Crossing the Qiantang River Northward, Military Personnel Arrive in Pudong, Command Authority Can Be Unified Afterward</h3>
<p>【Special Telegram from Shanghai, This Newspaper, 23rd】Special News from the Pudong Guerrilla Area: The regular troops that our side has been continuously deploying northward from the Qiantang River actually consist of four divisions. The organization and equipment are purely based on the latest wartime organization. Each division has 20,000 to 25,000 people (5,000 to 10,000 more than usual), so the troop strength is 80,000 to 90,000 people. Approximately 30,000 to 40,000 people have entered the Shanghai-Hangzhou line area. Experienced military personnel have been dispatched to various guerrilla areas to convey the intentions of the senior officers to the non-regularly organized mobile units and to unify the command of the regular and non-regular armies in order to enhance the connection. As for the Pudong and Punan guerrilla teams under the command of Ding Xishan, Yu Taosheng, and Zhang Huifang, these military personnel have all arrived, and it has been instructed that future actions should be based on the military orders of the regular army and should not advance or retreat arbitrarily. Miscellaneous troops who have temporarily defected due to environmental pressures are also allowed to return. According to reliable information, most of the puppet army has sent personnel to make contact, and the situation has undergone significant changes.</p>

<h3>A Sketch of Haifeng</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ming</p>
<p>【Continued from yesterday】The hair of women in Haifeng over middle age is just like those scholars on Mount Luofu. It is coiled on the top of the head and adorned with a "hairpin clock" (made of silver or copper, quite like the figures on the sedan chairs, but decorated with many patterns). Women's clothes are mostly simple, but their hard lives are also evident. Haifeng women have a special liking for drinking "salty tea." Every morning around ten o'clock, they mix tea leaves, salt, sesame, and boiling water and drink it. Those with a large appetite can drink more than ten bowls without hesitation. "Raw food" is also a Haifeng people's hobby. "Fresh oysters," "raw shrimp"... are only seasoned with salt before being eaten, which seems to be detrimental to health. The general people's economy is not enough to eat white rice. It is simply an exception. For every meal they use sweet potatoes - sweet potato porridge - to replace white rice three meals a day. The richer ones only eat sweet potatoes with less proportion and white rice with more proportion.</p>
<p>Because education is not popular in Haifeng, the lower and middle classes of people are extremely superstitious. On the birthday of a god or any other day, in temples like "Guanyin Temple," "Confucius Temple," "City God Temple," "Water Immortal Temple," etc., those worshiping and kneeling are all "pious men," not "pious women." The pious men dare to stand up only after they have received a "holy order" and obtained the permission of the Bodhisattva. Many elders still keep the dragon tail at the top of their Qing-dynasty queues.</p>
<p>Because Haifeng is near the sea, fish and salt are its major products. The fishing industry in Shanwei is very famous throughout the country. The local salt is very cheap, and the supply of salt to Shantou, northern Guangdong, and southern Jiangxi is all transported from Shanwei. In addition to the profits from fish and salt, sweet potatoes can be regarded as a major product, because the whole county eats sweet potato rice. There is no family in this place that burns firewood for cooking, they only use charcoal. Even firewood prepared for sale is burned first before being sold.</p>
<p>Three. Haifeng's Smuggling, Gambling, and Spies</p>
<p>The value of smuggled goods imported into Chao-Shan reaches over one million yuan per month. Haifeng accounts for at least tens of thousands of yuan. This is not a lie. Please come and see for yourself. When you go to the more prosperous areas like Shanwei, Jiesheng, Qingge, Gongping, Mei Lung-fu Cheng, etc., you will constantly see rayon fabrics, handbags, rubber shoes, children's toys, and various cosmetics (smuggled goods account for at least 60%) constantly appearing before your eyes. I will publish another article about the import of smuggled goods and smuggling conditions in the eastern Guangdong area. This reality naturally exists in Haifeng as well. As for the gambling atmosphere in Haifeng, it is indeed extremely prevalent. This is partly because there are no other (besides gambling) entertainment options, and partly because the people do not have various handicrafts to do.</p>
<p>There are indeed quite a lot of Haifeng spies after the flames of resistance against the enemy were ignited in South China.</p>
<p>What is most puzzling is that every time Shanwei ships salt to Shantou for transfer to the interior, × planes inevitably come to bomb the salt ships. There are no × warships off the coast of Shanwei, so why do the × people know such accurate information? The anti-espionage movement must be effectively implemented in Haifeng.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Burma Road</h3>
<p>— Written by Bishop Walter, Translated by Qian Boming</p>
<p>China and Burma can have great mutual assistance. South Asia and China have many contributions to each other. The newly opened international highway between Yangon and Kunming, and the railway currently under construction between these two cities, will become one of the most important international roads in the world.</p>
<p>Recently, the development of modern industry and modern transportation methods with other countries have made this road a vital artery of China's great west. Half a century ago, visionaries wanted to lay a railway between Yangon and Kunming, but the time was not ripe because the interests of the people and the country were in conflict. Fortunately, these obstacles are now in the past, and there are now modern conveniences for five-way trade between China and Burma, and each benefits from it.</p>
<p>On January 18th, our party set out from Yangon, following the new China-Burma highway to Kunming. Through the cooperation of Mr. Holmes, we obtained two new Dodge trucks weighing three-quarters of a ton as transportation. Our party totaled seven people. One truck carried most of our heavy luggage and two people. The remaining five people rode in another truck with comfortable American seat covers, comfortably making the journey.</p>
<p>On the evening of January 18th, our first army truck left Yangon. The second truck left shortly after noon the next day. The first four hundred and forty miles from Yangon to Mandalay, with good roads parallel to the sea level, we spent a few hours sightseeing in Mandalay, which was quite interesting. This famous city has the pagodas and palaces of the last Burmese dynasty. At that time, we remembered Kipling's poem: "On the road to Mandalay, where the flying fishes play." But we did not see flying fish, because the road we took was faster than the ships on the Irrawaddy River. Although we regarded Kunming as the destination of this trip, I did not recall the experience that could make us feel "a booming like China when it's morning"!</p>
<p>Fifteen or twenty miles out of Mandalay, we began to drive into the mountains, driving through or on top of the mountains towards Pyinmana. From Yangon to Lashio, except for a short stretch of less than twenty miles of highway, the rest of the road surface is very neat. The road out of Yangon also ends in Lashio. Lashio is about one hundred and ten miles from the Chinese border, with a beautiful position, about thirty feet above sea level, surrounded by beautiful mountains and deep valleys. The railway management agency has extended the railway to the outside of the city to facilitate the actions of various groups from the Chinese side. At the connecting point, these groups need to have a warehouse to store goods. The Burmese government is now earnestly and thoroughly taking its part of the responsibility for completing the connection between the China-Burma railway and highway. This is evident in many places. Regarding the attitude of the British, there is no doubt that it is easy to recall that the British Empire must strive to accomplish any undertaking.</p>
<p>This highway is indeed under the management of the Chinese and Burmese governments. In particular, from Mandalay to Lashio and then to Kunming, public traffic is not allowed. From Lashio to Kunming, travelers are inspected before many obstacles. Fortunately, we had reported our plans to the government officials of both countries a long time before departure and when we actually set off, so we received courteous hospitality and cooperation everywhere, and also obtained letters of introduction and passes, which we could use when needed.</p>
<p>On the Chinese side, transportation and travel on the highway must be permitted by the Southwest Transportation Company. In Yangon, Kunming, and important locations between the two cities, we saw well-trained, knowledgeable, and courteous people managing the offices of the Southwest Transportation Company, handling affairs efficiently. Some of our group had traveled extensively in China in previous years and were all delighted with the efficient handling and sincere and courteous hospitality of the personnel responsible for the entire highway.</p>
<p>The old military highway of the Burmese government from Lashio to the border was undoubtedly suitable for initial use, but it is too narrow for the large amount of new traffic, so it is now being rapidly widened.</p>
<p>On both sides of the border live mountain people who are mixed with Chinese, including Burmese mountain people and Chinese mountain people. They seem to be descendants of early immigrants from northern Asia and have their own language and many customs that are completely different from other people. On both sides of the border, they maintain an old-fashioned feudal organization. The first district center in these small areas is in Menglu. If, like us, you set off from Lashio by car in the early morning, you can reach Mengxue on the first night. We drove to about thirty miles from Mengxue and received courteous hospitality at the school established by the local government, and spent the night in the school.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Longling, where the Chinese customs office is located. Here again we saw very capable modern Chinese people managing the offices of the transportation company, immediately handling our affairs and sending us on our way. In order to complete the next leg of the journey, we drove straight into the night, braving the biting cold wind on the very high highway. When we arrived at Xiaguan, the Southwest Transportation Company courteously invited us to stay in the guesthouse, which was a converted temple equipped with various conveniences to facilitate the company's personnel.</p>
<p>The next morning, we saw snow in the valley. Our location was eight thousand feet high, and the valley was about two thousand feet higher. This was the only place we saw snow along the way. We were lucky not to have encountered rain or snow from Yangon to Kunming. Because of the mountainous cliffs, the road workers who built this highway had to laboriously open up the road by hand on the sides and faces of the mountains.</p>
<p>The road surface is often blocked by rocks and mud that are washed down by heavy rains, either by erosion under the road or by mud falling from above. The road is currently very safe in the half-term long dry season, but there may be many difficulties during the rainy season in June. Management personnel are now using thousands of workers to widen dangerous areas, remove more of the soil, and build stone road surfaces on Burmese holes to replace temporary wooden frames, and reduce the degree of slope in some places.</p>
<p>Anyone who passes this new highway will be even more convinced that China will win the final victory in this war. The road itself, which can carry heavy trucks to completion, is of great significance, and the railway, which is now being rapidly built, will run parallel to this highway, foretelling that the great west of China will no longer be as isolated as it used to be.</p>
<p>In these areas, no one feels the density of smoke, but they feel that modern transportation methods will rapidly develop the resources of southern China, both in terms of people and materials.</p>
<p>Since many coastal cities in China have been occupied by the invaders, it is necessary to adjust the supply of salt, which is essential for the lives of the Chinese people. The great west of China has huge salt deposits, one of which is in this southwest region. Tens of thousands of square salt bricks can be seen along the highway, with unique shapes for easy carrying. This kind of salt deposit is obviously taken from places far away from the edge of the ancient lake. If salt deposits are found on the lakeside and fish, vegetables, and other things are deposited together with the salt grains, it contains goiter. I saw a large number of people with goiter on several sections of the new highway, more than I had ever seen before.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the resources that China can obtain after opening up new transportation facilities. From Yangon to the Chinese border and even further, I have seen thousands of oxcarts. The new highway even makes the transportation of these vehicles more effective. Anyone who leaves the oxcart area will be deeply impressed by the shortage of labor in handling various modern products and trade. Therefore, China has purchased thousands of cars to run in the southwest, so it is very interesting to remember the changes that are coming.</p>
<p>This war, like other wars, will end one day. The China-Burma Highway will be even more effective in peacetime than in the current emergency. It seems destined to become one of the world's famous scenic international roads. Driving on this road for a few days, the scenery of Guanghan, the towering mountains, steep cliffs, and secluded valleys, is constantly changing. Because the terrain is much higher than the south, the temperature is cool, the air is fresh, and not too cold. When agencies such as the China Travel Service, Thomas Cook, and American Express comfortably drive tourists around the world through this highway in the future, they will know that it is a profitable business. It is now enough to drive from Lashio to Kunming by car in four days. If time is limited, the journey can be completed in a shorter time. On the other hand, if someone wants to camp or climb mountains and spend two weeks or a month, then this highway will give him the opportunity for the most enjoyable vacation.</p>
<p>The benefits of the China-Burma Highway are not one-sided, but Burma benefits more than China, and China's import and export trade will also greatly benefit the Burmese people.</p>
<p>Although we lingered in Burma for a few days, we have seen how the country has become another battleground in the current war. The Burmese government and its many true politicians and enlightened civil leaders know that their country and China will benefit from this highway and railway in the future. However, those who are using all means to obstruct China's freedom and development are using money to promote misinterpretations to Burmese people whom they believe can be swayed, and illegally misinterpreting the phrase "Asia for Asians." Neutral observers doubt whether this slogan can fool others. As Abraham Lincoln said: "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time"!</p>

<h3>I Request the League of Nations to Implement Expanded Aid to China and Cease Supplying War Materials to Japan; British Foreign Secretary States Responsibility is Not Forgotten</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] Dr. Wellington Koo, Chinese Ambassador to France, delivered a moving speech to the League of Nations Council today, making two requests: First, that member states be notified to expand their financial and material assistance to China to enhance its ability to resist aggression and to aid refugees, to avoid any actions that would weaken China's resistance to aggression, to cease supplying Japan with war tools and raw materials, especially aircraft and oil, to prevent further intensification of its aggression, and to restrict the import of Japanese goods; Second, to form a group to jointly promote the above steps. Ambassador Koo stated that China is willing to exert its utmost strength in manpower and resources to serve as the outpost of the world peace front. If China were to succumb to Japanese threats or cease resisting Japanese aggression and accept Japan's monopoly in the Far East, the impact on the interests of democratic countries in the Far East and on the current tense situation in Europe would be obvious to any discerning person. Ambassador Koo also briefly described the current situation, saying that China's strategy is to avoid positional warfare and adopt mobile tactics to annihilate the invading army concentrating its attacks on fixed targets. They are struggling to grasp the location of the main force of the Chinese army. This strategy has placed the Chinese army in a proactive position, allowing it to launch attacks on the invading army from all sides simultaneously. Ambassador Koo further pointed out that the Japanese army's plot to cut off China's two international transportation arteries has clearly failed. American aircraft companies have unanimously complied with the U.S. government's advice last July to stop selling aircraft to Japan. This determination is truly commendable. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax then spoke, echoing Ambassador Koo's request, saying, "We are deeply moved by the speech of the distinguished representative of China. We are not only uneasy in view of the suffering of the Chinese people, but also admire their unity and courage. For more than two years, the world has witnessed China being oppressed by its neighbor, which brings all of its wealth and all of its modern weapons of war to bear on China. In fact, it would be in Japan's interest to have genuine amity and goodwill towards China. The Chinese people's efforts in resisting the war have gained widespread and profound sympathy, and the British government is among them. However, the reason why the British government feels unable to fully support the broad suggestions made by Dr. Koo just now is not a lack of sympathy, nor can it be said that the British government has abandoned the policy previously decided by the representatives of the League of Nations regarding the Far Eastern war. The British government's desire to sincerely create an opportunity for a fair resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute has remained unchanged, and the responsibility to provide individual assistance to China as much as possible, as decided by the League of Nations on October 6, 1937, is always on our minds. As a member of the League of Nations, Britain has never avoided assuming this sense of duty. Therefore, Britain not only does not want to close the connecting lines between Chinese and British territories, but also opens up new communication routes to facilitate China, and at the same time provides financial assistance to China. There is no need for me to elaborate on the details. The British government hopes, and the Chinese government seems to have acknowledged, that although these measures are sometimes taken with a view to safeguarding Britain's own interests, they also greatly benefit China's current difficulties. In the future, the British government will never dare to forget the needs of the Chinese people and the responsibilities entrusted by the previous resolution of the League of Nations. The Chinese representative's suggestion to establish a subcommittee to pay special attention to the Far East, to consult on joint measures under Article 16 of the Covenant, is also reminiscent of similar suggestions made at previous meetings. At that time, there was unanimous agreement on the principle of this joint action, but at the same time it was found that the basic elements of this joint action were still lacking." At this point, Lord Halifax asked the representatives of various countries whether the situation had changed since the last meeting, and whether they felt that the above-mentioned basic elements had already emerged. He said that he was convinced that all countries with direct relations with China must feel that it was not yet the time. Therefore, it would be insincere for him to expect the British government to assume the new responsibilities indicated in Dr. Koo's suggestion at this time, when Britain still bears significant responsibilities elsewhere in the world. The British government believes that other countries must also feel the same way. For this reason, the British government fears that the establishment of a consultative subcommittee at this time would be unlikely to achieve any results. Mr. Jordan, the New Zealand High Commissioner, expressed absolute support for China's proposal and urged the League of Nations Council to accept Dr. Koo's suggestion. At this point, the meeting was temporarily adjourned so that Soviet Ambassador Maisky could exchange views with other representatives.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 22nd] China has proposed to the League of Nations the organization of a cooperation committee similar to the 52-nation committee that sanctioned Italy's aggression against Abyssinia, but this request does not appear to have any immediate hope of success because Britain and France still need to consider it. China also wants to invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, but Britain and France seem to believe that the European crisis has not been completely resolved, so the solution to the Far Eastern problem still needs to wait.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd] The League of Nations Council held a closed-door meeting this morning. Our representative, Wellington Koo, spoke, urging the Council to discuss China's appeal as soon as possible, and not to wait until the regular session is about to close before discussing it. The representatives immediately agreed unanimously to list China's appeal as the first item on the agenda of this afternoon's open meeting. Regarding the telegram sent by the King of Albania to the League of Nations last week, the representatives of the major countries on the Council intended to avoid discussing it. However, Ambassador Koo and Soviet Ambassador Maisky both dissented. Ambassador Koo stood up and said that China had no direct or indirect interest in Albania, but since Albania was a member state of the League of Nations, this issue involved the principles of the League of Nations Covenant and international law, and the survival of the League of Nations organization was also related to it. It is understood that Ambassador Koo specifically avoided attacking Italy when speaking. The Council generally intends to refer the Albanian issue to the next session of the League of Nations General Assembly. The Council will listen to Ambassador Koo's statement when it meets this afternoon. So far, there has been no further discussion of the China issue. Ambassador Koo will exchange views with the British and French foreign ministers before they leave tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Italian and German Foreign Ministers Deliver Broadcast Speeches; U.S. to Intensify Implementation of Defense Plan Due to German-Italian Military Alliance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] The signing ceremony of the German-Italian political and military treaty was recently held in the "Ambassador's Hall" of the State Council. Many pots of lilac flowers were placed in the hall. Four German civil servants stood upright in front of the table, each holding a copy of the treaty, totaling four copies, two in Italian and two in German. At exactly 11:00 a.m., German Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop entered the hall simultaneously. Leaders of the military and party departments, as well as civil and military officials, and more than 100 Italian and German diplomats, followed in orderly fashion. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the head of state's office to greet Hitler out of the hall. The head of state sat in a chair in the center, and the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy signed the alliance treaty one after another. Hitler looked quite excited and shook hands with Ribbentrop and Ciano with pleasure, and presented Ciano with the Golden Eagle Medal, the highest medal in Germany. At 11:12 a.m., Foreign Minister Ciano immediately delivered a broadcast speech on the radio, saying that the political and military ties between Germany and Italy have been strengthened by the signing of the treaty. The fate of the two sides is as close as lips and teeth, which is well known to the two nations. Both countries are willing to maintain peace, but are also determined to defend their inalienable right to exist. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then delivered a broadcast speech, saying that Germany and Italy have now become an indivisible group. If the rule-of-law countries feel suspicious and unite with other countries to conclude treaties, attempting to encircle Germany and Italy, it is tantamount to driving down the road to war. This German-Italian alliance treaty is to give a firm answer to this. From now on, no matter what events occur, our two countries will resolutely unite to deal with them. Regarding the union of Germany and Italy, Head of State Hitler has made a clear statement here, willing to conclude a broad political and military promotion treaty with Italy to enhance the relationship between the two countries, and the treaty signed today is its decision.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Japanese government has sent a telegram to the German government congratulating the formal signing of the German-Italian military alliance. Hitler and King Emmanuel of Italy, as well as Mussolini, exchanged congratulatory telegrams.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had not yet seen the full text of the German-Italian alliance treaty officially published, so he did not want to comment on it. According to well-informed sources, this move was expected in general, so there was no need to comment on it immediately. What the United States is most concerned about is the balance of power in Europe and what impact it will have on the position of the United States in the Americas and the Far East. The direct impact of the conclusion of the alliance between Germany and Italy is to prompt the United States to intensify the implementation of its defense plan. At the same time, the international arms race will inevitably become more intense, but world peace may be maintained through the balance of power distribution.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Palestine Policy; Colonial Secretary MacDonald States Maintaining Appropriate Interests of Both Races</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Undersecretary Butler denied in the House of Commons today, in response to questions about Palestine, that the government's new policy was grossly unfair to American and Jewish investment in Palestine, and cited the provisions of the White Paper, urging attention to the need to consider foreign interests. Colonial Secretary MacDonald began debating the government's Palestine policy, saying that the government hoped to express this policy under various different circumstances. When the House last debated this matter, it was hoped that the Arabs and Jews, despite their struggles, could still reach an understanding. Today, that hope has been dashed, so the government has automatically decided on a policy on this issue. This policy is bound to have opposition. The Royal Commission of Inquiry went to Palestine in 1937 and believed that the conflict between Arabs and Jews in the area was not a question of who was right and who was wrong, but a question of dispute between the two sides. This is the real situation, and it is a difficult task for the House to judge the demands of both sides in this situation in order to find a fair solution. The situation in Palestine was caused by the disruption of the war. At that time, the great powers of the earth were competing with each other, seeking friends and alliances. The Arabs and Jews are two nations willing to stay in Palestine, and both nations participated in the war. MacDonald continued to express sympathy for the demands of the Jews and reiterated the situation of the Arabs, saying, "Although we can force the Arabs to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine, it is morally wrong. We must abide by our promise to the Jews and maintain faith with the Arabs." Regarding the U.S. government's promise to the Jews, MacDonald stated that Lord Balfour's promise in 1917 was that "the government would make its best efforts to see the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine." MacDonald continued, saying that some people thought that the meaning of this promise might be to change Palestine into a Jewish state. This possibility has not been absolutely abandoned. Lloyd George also made a guarantee during his time as Prime Minister in 1917, but the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate Agreement did not mention "Jewish Home," but only used a less definite expression, recognizing that Jews could live in Palestine and selecting the term "Jewish national home." When the Balfour Declaration was established, its purpose was to give a landless people a land without people. MacDonald hoped that Palestine would be a vast open space where people establishing homes could concentrate on great creative work, but Palestine was not an empty space. In 1918, there were 600,000 Arabs in the area. The British government has long resolutely stated that there should be no one nation in Palestine that is subordinate to another nation. The British government during Balfour's tenure as Foreign Secretary also had the same determination, so there is no need for any misunderstanding from all parties. The establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine is not to oppose the Arabs, but to establish a Jewish state. Regarding the issue of emigration to Palestine, the British government did declare in 1922 that the number of colonists should not exceed the economic and absorption capacity of the area, but the British government can never strictly adhere to this principle at any time or under any circumstances without making any amendments. In 1923, the number of Jews was 80,000, and now it has increased to 450,000. The British government is determined to find a way to ensure that the minority and majority ethnic groups in Palestine receive appropriate benefits. Britain is quite satisfied with signing treaties with Palestine, maintaining land and air forces, using military ports and airfields, discussing military issues, and providing mutual assistance in the event of difficulties. Mr. Williams stood up and proposed an official opposing motion, saying that the government's proposal could not bring peace and prosperous development to Palestine. The White Paper has destroyed the basic principles of the Balfour Declaration. The government's plan is contrary to history and has no moral basis. He also requested the House to refuse to accept the parliamentary obligations read by MacDonald, saying that this would cause the government to lose confidence in the country and the United States.</p>
<p>Cripps Makes a Suggestion</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Sir Stafford Cripps, who attended the Palestine debate in the House of Commons last night, made a suggestion that part of Palestine should be temporarily designated as Jewish territory, and the Jews should be allowed to organize an autonomous government in this area, while the Arabs could form a government in other parts of Palestine. During this period of division, the Arab economic life gradually developed. After ten years, the Arab and Jewish nations gradually approached and had the opportunity to work together. Labor Party members believe that the government's proposal is a surrender to terrorists. The unrest in Palestine is supported by Germany and Italy. Without external propaganda, Arabs and Jews could have lived in harmony. Undersecretary Butler replied on behalf of the government, "The government has expressed to both the Arabs and Jews that some of their demands cannot be realized. We should make the day when the Arab and Jewish nations can cooperate and understand each other arrive as soon as possible. The Arab representatives in London, Palestine, are all statesmen and will be of great benefit to our current difficulties," he said.</p>
<h3>British King and Queen Tour Toronto and Meet the Dionne Quintuplets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Toronto, 22nd] The British King and Queen arrived here today and were warmly welcomed by Ontario Governor Hepburn. The King declared that he was very happy to visit here with the Queen, but was sorry that he could not stay for long. Local communities held a welcome meeting at the City Hall. Thousands of people gathered at the hall to pay tribute to the King and Queen. Afterwards, the King and Queen drove to the State Assembly, where they were warmly welcomed by the crowd and met the famous Dionne quintuplets. The Queen was very happy and gave each child a blue basket dress and kissed them one by one.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Speech: Will Not Give Up Social and Economic Reforms; Continue Efforts to Help the Lower Classes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] President Roosevelt delivered a speech today, saying that the U.S. government will never give up any social and economic reforms. The expenditure of the "New Deal" is very appropriate, and the government should continue to work hard to help the lower classes. President Roosevelt expressed dissatisfaction with the "National Debt Week" held by the Republican Party this week, and stated that the tax rates for small and large businesses and consumers must be maintained. President Roosevelt continued, saying that the current situation in the United States is extremely good and very beneficial to promoting production and business.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Control Coastal Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Mr. Rikita, acting deputy commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, announced to the outside world that from next Thursday (June 1), all foreign ships sailing along the Chinese coast must carry a permit from the Japanese Navy, otherwise they will be arrested by the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>Rikita is a customs officer and has no right to make such an announcement according to law, so this announcement has no legal effect. However, the consistent behavior of fascist aggressors is to destroy law and order. As long as it is beneficial to fascist aggression and plunder, then all their speculative adventures, destruction, plunder, slaughter, etc., are the laws of their fascist aggressors. Therefore, Rikita dared to say after announcing Japan's intention that "this is a decision made by the Japanese authorities due to military needs"! In other words, Japan's intention is very likely to become a reality;</p>
<p>Japan's control of China's coastal shipping industry certainly has the military significance of intensifying threats to the war zones in our occupied areas, but the main attempt is to further threaten European and American powers, especially to cut off the lifelines of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East, and to strengthen its plunder and oppression in the occupied areas in order to save the serious misfortune suffered by its war of aggression against China. Even if it is a step back, it can also be used as a condition for the current negotiations on the concession issue, so as to facilitate its seizure of special rights in the concession. Therefore, we can clearly point out that Japan's attempt is a strategy before Britain, the United States, France, and other countries have formed a unified front to sanction the East, and Japan is preparing to comprehensively exclude the powers of Europe and the United States in the Far East!</p>
<p>Therefore, we and the media should mobilize and urge the close attention of European and American powers and friendly people. We should solemnly point out that Japan's intention is indeed likely to quickly become a reality, and Japan's actions not only destroy the Chinese customs administration, but also violate international law, especially the intention to plunder and destroy the rights and interests of European and American powers in the Far East. Britain, the United States, France, and other countries should quickly take effective steps to give appropriate and necessary sanctions and counterattacks! We firmly believe that Japan's behavior cannot withstand the joint handling of the powers of Europe and the United States!</p>
<h3>Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Agree to Conclude a Mutual Assistance Treaty; Turkey and Greece Welcome It; Poland Will Discuss This in Detail</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd Special Telegram] According to our agency's inquiry, the proposal for a tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union does not involve the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border issue, because the scope of the alliance agreement is limited to Europe. Britain has sought the opinions of Eastern European countries on this matter and is still waiting for a reply. It is generally believed that Turkey will definitely welcome it. The relationship between Greece and Turkey is quite close and can also agree. The Polish Ambassador to Britain flew back to Warsaw from London today. It is said that this trip is to take care of personal matters, but after arriving in Warsaw, he will definitely consult with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in detail, which is undoubted.</p>
<p>[London, 22nd] Foreign news, London newspapers are publishing the news of the establishment of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union in prominent positions. It is said that the full text of the agreement will be announced after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The newspapers are speculating on the content of the agreement, but the unanimous opinion is that this agreement was originally proposed by the Soviet Union and modified by the British counterproposal. General public opinion almost unanimously believes that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have agreed to conclude a tripartite mutual assistance treaty. According to the treaty, if any one country is invaded, the other two countries should provide assistance. It is said that the content of the tripartite agreement includes the Soviet Union's East Asian border, that is, guaranteeing to assist the Soviet Union in resisting Japanese invasion. In addition to mutual assistance, the Soviet Union has also agreed to participate in guaranteeing the sovereignty of Poland and Romania, and will not temporarily provide guarantees to the Baltic countries. It is said that Turkey will also immediately join the alliance and become a four-nation alliance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd] After French Foreign Minister Bonnet held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax separately, well-informed sources immediately declared that all the difficulties in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the organization of an anti-aggression group have been resolved, and there is no longer any danger of failure in the current negotiations. The British Cabinet will hold a cabinet meeting on the 24th of this month to decide on the conclusion of a joint defense agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. According to reports, during the talks between Ambassador Maisky and Foreign Minister Bonnet, the difficulties in establishing an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union were carefully explained. Foreign Minister Bonnet was very satisfied after hearing this, and then held talks with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, and agreed that the points of consultation between Britain and the Soviet Union have now been completely eliminated. In addition, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also deeply knows the reasons why Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately establish a joint defense agreement.</p>
<p>[London, 23rd] Foreign news, the Danzig incident has apparently calmed down. The press and political circles here are now paying attention to tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax returned here from Geneva tonight, carrying the results of the negotiations with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and French Foreign Minister Bonnet. According to press reports, Lord Halifax will visit Chamberlain tonight and submit the details of the Geneva negotiations to tomorrow's cabinet meeting.</p>
<h3>Maisky</h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, is now a celebrity. However, if it hadn't been for a scrap of paper that saved his life twenty-seven years ago, the world would never have seen this short, stout diplomat again.</p>
<p>Maisky is the son of a Jewish doctor, whose real name is Ivan Lyakhovetsky; he was born in Siberia and educated in Omsk. During the Tsarist era, he was an active young journalist.</p>
<p>He gradually became interested in politics, but unfortunately, he chose the wrong party. He joined the Social Democratic Party, which opposed Lenin's radical revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>When the Bolshevik Revolution failed in 1905, Maisky took the opportunity to vehemently denounce the futility of terrorism.</p>
<p>In 1912, his fiery articles aroused the hatred of the Bolsheviks. His life was immediately threatened, and he had to plan his escape to England.</p>
<p>Before leaving Russia, he met with his only influential friend, Churchill, who was then a key official in the Tsarist Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow.</p>
<p>As he said goodbye to Churchill, Churchill gave him a letter, telling him to always carry it with him. Maisky didn't pay much attention and casually stuffed it into his pocket, later forgetting about it.</p>
<p>At that time, Bolshevik secret agents were closely following him. However, he was lucky enough to cross the border. In the summer of 1912, he arrived in Newhaven.</p>
<p>At the Newhaven customs, Maisky encountered misfortune again. Because he didn't understand English, the customs officials found an interpreter to tell him that, according to British regulations, foreigners must have five pounds in cash to enter the country.</p>
<p>So, Maisky had to take out his money. He slowly, as if deliberately delaying, put the money on the table. Finally, he shook his hand, indicating that this was all he had. The customs officer came over to count the money, once, twice, three times, and there was no mistake. He told Maisky that he only had three pounds, two shillings, and sixpence, short of one pound, seventeen shillings, and sixpence.</p>
<p>This was terrible. If he didn't have enough money, Maisky would be forced to return to Russia, where those hunting him were waiting.</p>
<p>Maisky wanted to salvage this tragic fate and searched his body frantically, hoping to find some unexpected wealth.</p>
<p>In the end, he still didn't find any money. However, he pulled out a scrap of paper from his pocket. It was the letter that Churchill had given him months ago.</p>
<p>This letter saved his life, because it was officially certified by the Russian government that Maisky was a fugitive forced to flee for political reasons.</p>
<p>Immediately, the customs changed their attitude towards him and allowed him to enter the country, because Britain has always allowed fugitives to enter without restrictions.</p>
<p>For the next five years, Maisky resided in England, publishing articles in several Russian émigré newspapers to make a living.</p>
<p>When the Russian Revolution of 1917 came, Maisky believed that his party, or the Mensheviks, would eventually succeed. Then, he could return to his country.</p>
<p>However, the Bolsheviks succeeded again, and he had to flee again. This time, he fled to his birthplace, Siberia.</p>
<p>There, Maisky devoted himself to writing, penning several books on politics and economics. Later, these books were seen by people in the Soviet government, who felt it was a waste not to use Maisky.</p>
<p>In 1920, they reconciled, and Maisky joined the Soviet Foreign Ministry. In 1922, he became the director of the Foreign Ministry's intelligence department, at which time he married an English woman named Skeabin.</p>
<p>In 1932, he was sent as ambassador to the United Kingdom, bringing his wife with him. He established an extremely sophisticated embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens.</p>
<p>Although Maisky used to be a poor scholar, his extravagance is now well-known in London. The recent banquet he held at the embassy for guests was a rare sight in British social circles in recent years.</p>
<p>Maisky is 55 years old this year, short and stout, with eternally rosy cheeks. At a glance, one can tell that he is a person who lives very comfortably.</p>
<p>Now, Maisky is negotiating with Britain and France in Geneva. After Litvinov's departure, Maisky is the most suitable person to represent the Soviet Union in diplomatic relations with Britain and France.</p>

<h3>Germany and Japan Purchase Large Quantities of Rice from Annam and Siam; Hong Kong Rice Market Stable and Unaffected; Hong Kong and Kowloon Have Hundreds of Thousands of Bags of Rice in Stock, Enough to Last Six Months</h3>
<p>According to news from reporters yesterday, Germany and Japan have recently been actively stockpiling grain to prepare for war, purchasing and storing large quantities of rice from the rice-producing countries of Annam and Siam. Special inquiries were made to rice industry giants in Hong Kong about the situation and its impact on Hong Kong. They said that Siam is one of the world's three major rice markets, relying on exports to supply food to areas with shortages throughout the Far East. The largest sales are in Hong Kong and transshipped to the mainland. However, after the fall of Guangzhou, the market for Siamese rice in Hong Kong became sluggish, but this sluggishness quickly revived. The main reason is that the two aggressor nations in Europe and the Far East, Germany and Japan, have been actively stockpiling rice, separately purchasing large quantities of rice from Annam and Siam, thus revitalizing the Annam and Siam rice markets. In the past, Germany purchased significant quantities of brown rice and white rice from Annam and Siam every year, but this year has been particularly increased. According to reliable estimates from Hong Kong rice merchants, as of this month, Germany has purchased approximately more than 20,000 tons of brown rice from Siam and the same quantity of white rice from Annam. These numbers account for almost half of the total rice exports from Annam and Siam. Japan, in the past, directly purchased broken rice from Siam through government-organized companies. This practice was discontinued two or three years ago, but in recent months, they have again been purchasing large quantities from Siam, totaling about 300,000 to 400,000 bags, with a portion being shipped back to Japan for supply and a portion being shipped to North China. Japan has experienced a shortage of staple foods after a long period of war and must purchase large quantities from Siam for supply. Siam produces approximately 1.6 million tons of rice each year. After the war in South China, shipments to various places exploded, with Malaya being the most. However, after Germany and Japan competed to purchase, the situation changed again. In the current situation, Siamese rice occupies the most active position in the German and Japanese markets. However, this situation has no impact on the Hong Kong rice market. According to the rice merchants, Hong Kong is close to Annam and Siam, enjoying transportation convenience. Even if Europe purchases large quantities, it will not affect Hong Kong's rice supply. At present, Hong Kong's rice stocks are extremely abundant, totaling about hundreds of thousands of bags. Based on the current population, the daily demand for white rice is about 6,000 bags. According to Hong Kong's rice stocks, even if supply is stopped for six months, it will be sufficient to maintain. The price of rice in Hong Kong has remained stable in recent days, without major changes.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Announces Strict Prohibition of Indiscriminate Dumping of Sewage; Meeting Held Yesterday Afternoon; Construction of Public Toilets Approved</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau held a meeting at 4:15 PM yesterday. Attendees included Todd, Medical Officer Stu, Yongjue, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Currie, Police Commissioner Barton, Director of Marine Howard, Councilors Basto, Agori, Chow Sien, Tam A-Shi, Wong Bing-Yao, Tang Shiu-Kin and Shen Jianru. After the meeting, Chairman Todd first read the government's official letter regarding the appointment of Shen Jian as a member of the Municipal Health Bureau to replace Berlin Mei, who is temporarily leaving Hong Kong. Subsequently, the Chairman proposed the following motion for approval: "The members of this Bureau have visited the site of the planned construction of public toilets on Mo Lo Ha Street and studied the objections raised by the Central Theatre business. The unanimous opinion is that the reasons are not sufficient. This Bureau decides to maintain the resolution of the Bureau's conference on November 8, 1938. The resolution is listed in the Bureau Secretary's official document to the Auxiliary Secretary on November 9, 1938." It was passed without dissent. Councilor Wong Bing-Yao raised the following questions regarding the disposal of night soil: (A) Has the Chairman noticed that the disposal of night soil, in addition to following the prescribed methods, is sometimes dumped into open drains and flushed down the channels? (B) Will the Chairman take steps to investigate such incidents and prevent their recurrence? The Chairman replied that the Cleansing Bureau was already aware of the dumping of night soil into drains instead of transferring it to fecal barges. This behavior violates Section 4 of the Minor Offenses Ordinance and Section 8 of the Cleansing Bylaws. The authorities have taken all possible steps to prevent such behavior. Employees of the Cleansing Bureau, from inspectors to street cleaners, have the authority to arrest and prosecute anyone found dumping night soil. The police, of course, have the same authority. Such offenses often occur at night, making investigation difficult. Upon receiving any report of night soil dumping, the authorities immediately order inspectors or foremen to monitor. Arresting offenders has been effective. In the past year, 69 people have been arrested for dumping night soil. Offenders are sentenced to imprisonment or fines by the court. Most of the offenders are night soil carriers.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Driven Mad by Missing Husband; Causes Uproar at Wireless Telegraph Office; Sings and Dances, Calling Herself an Imperial Consort; Taken to Hospital After Police Intervention</h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday, a young woman with short hair, wearing a floral shirt and black pants, suddenly broke into the Central Government Wireless Telegraph Office in Central, singing songs and dancing, calling herself the Heavenly Jade Emperor's Imperial Consort and demanding to file a complaint against her younger uncle. She then proceeded to disrupt the equipment in the telegraph machine room. Employees of the office gathered to stop her and tried to drive her out, but the woman was as strong as an ox and could not be removed. They were forced to sound the alarm. A Chinese officer who was passing by gathered staff to escort the woman back to the Central Police Station to notify her family, and then sent her to the asylum for treatment. It is reported that the madwoman's name is Ho Yip-fong, 30 years old, and she lives with her mother and child on Yik Yam Street in Sham Shui Po. Her husband, Lau Leung, was a hair stylist at a beauty salon. Due to the heavy burden of family expenses, he went to Penang, Singapore, in April last year to seek employment. However, a few months after Lau's departure, Ho became overly sentimental and her nerves were severely stimulated. At the end of last year, madness suddenly broke out, singing, dancing, crying, and laughing erratically. Her family, suffering from this, wanted to send her to the hospital for treatment, but were constrained by economic difficulties and could do nothing. In recent days, the madness has become even worse. Yesterday morning, she somehow broke into the Government Wireless Telegraph Office and caused a disturbance.</p>

<h3>The Prelude to Universal Education and Elimination of Illiteracy: New Writing Lesson One</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the New Writing Training Class. Zhang Yilin.</p>
<p>"New Writing Registration Closed!"</p>
<p>The day after the New Writing Society announced the recruitment of students for the "New Writing Teacher Training Class," this sign of "Latecomers Excused" was put up. From this, we can see the strong interest of the general public in the new writing, and even more so the eagerness of young people for knowledge.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, they began their first lesson.</p>
<p>The address was borrowed from Wan Chai Chi Chung School. A classroom that was not very large was filled with 60 students, plus another ten or twenty auditors. All were energetic young men and women.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began by inviting Mr. Zhang Yilin, the nationally renowned "Old Son Army" from Suzhou and current senator, to give a speech. Mr. Zhang's beard and hair were snow-white, but his spirit was still very strong, and his thinking retained his youthfulness.</p>
<p>The old man inevitably started with "In the old days." Mr. Zhang gave a historical account of the Chinese language movement in the past. He detailed everything from the phonetic symbols of the late Qing Dynasty thirty years ago, to Mr. Cai Yuanpei's Pronunciation Unification Conference in the first year of the Republic of China, to Mr. Wu Zhihui's National Pronunciation Dictionary in the seventh year of the Republic, to the efforts of a former ambassador to Japan to promote the new writing, to the effects of the church using the Roman alphabet to teach local dialects in order to promote the Bible... He spoke in great detail, as if recalling family treasures. The conclusion was that the new writing was a necessary result of historical evolution, the most progressive writing, and the best tool for eliminating illiteracy. Therefore, he earnestly encouraged the students to study with a beginning and an end, and for everyone to be a pioneer in popular education.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang became more and more excited as he spoke, and added many moving extrapolations.</p>
<p>In his article "My View of Mandarin," Mr. Zhang once said that illiteracy is like a stomachache, which must be relieved quickly. The effect of using phonetic symbols is like riding a rickshaw, while using the new writing is like flying in an airplane. In the Soviet Union, the illiteracy rate used to be over 90 percent. Since the popularization of education using the new writing, it has dropped sharply, and the literacy rate is now over 90 percent. The new writing is also closely related to political clarity. The corruption of officials often takes advantage of the people's illiteracy and lack of knowledge. Promoting the new writing to improve the people's cultural level is also a fundamental task for resisting the war and building the country, and it is a great help to the government in promoting new policies. He hoped that it could be done well in Hong Kong and serve as a model for the whole country. Finally, Mr. Zhang expressed his admiration for Mr. Wang Junheng, Zhou Huasong, Sun Yuan, Wu Dali, Wo Dan, Chen Xin, Chen Zhaoqiu, Cao Linsheng, and Feng Yufang for their financial and material support in organizing the "New Writing Training Class."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Junheng translated Mr. Zhang's Suzhou Mandarin into Cantonese. Everyone was very interested in the "new type of Cantonese" that this language expert had learned in a very short time, and the reporter was also very impressed by his talent and courage in speaking.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Feng Yufang, a design committee member of the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department, gave a speech. He had studied abroad for more than ten years and believed that the biggest change was in writing. Kemal's success in creating a new Turkey was largely due to improving the writing system.</p>
<p>As for the greatest writing reform movement, it was undoubtedly the Soviet Union. To this day, the Soviet Union has 128 new writing systems, and 11 dialects can be spoken and 11 writing systems can be written in the Congress. This is a sign of the progress of the new writing and national equality. Looking back at our country, if we take Beijing Mandarin as the standard, the vast majority of the working masses simply do not have the time and energy to learn it. According to general statistics, it takes 5,000 hours to learn Chinese characters to the point of being able to read newspapers and write letters. If you study for five hours a day, it will take three years. Farmers and workers are busy with labor, and at most they can spare one hour a day to study. By the time they get to the coffin, they still won't understand - this is a real fact! This caused everyone to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>What about using the new writing? According to Shanghai's experience, the dumbest illiterate person can read newspapers and write letters in 150 hours. The smart ones can master it in just 80 hours. As for those who have been educated, it only takes a dozen hours to master it.</p>
<p>We are not against Chinese characters, but as times change, China will have two writing systems. The rich can have time to learn Chinese characters, and the poor masses must have the tool of writing to read newspapers, write letters, and study various subjects. The new writing is indispensable. Without the new writing, the working masses will always be cut off from knowledge.</p>
<p>Even English must be improved. How many of our Chinese students, from junior high school to high school to university graduation, after spending ten years on English, can be fluent in it?</p>
<p>Foreigners have also felt this way and are already working to improve English. Because the standard of good writing is whether or not it can use writing symbols in the shortest amount of time as a tool for expression. According to the sales of Hong Kong newspapers, it can be seen that 95 out of 100 people do not read newspapers. This is the greatest shame, and we must quickly use the new writing to remedy it.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Chen Xin gave a speech, and then classes officially began. The first lesson was taught by Mr. Wang Junheng on "Theory," and the second lesson was taught by Mr. Wu Dali on "Reader." This opening lesson ended happily at 9:30 PM. Each student spent only three copper coins to buy textbooks, and there were no other expenses. The class schedule is Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The courses include theory, reader, writing, current affairs forum, selected readings, composition, teaching methods, translation, singing, and other subjects. After graduating in six weeks, those with excellent grades will be selected and sent to various places to promote the new writing, and the association will subsidize each person with HK$20 per month. We sincerely extend our best wishes for the launch of this great movement!</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Prohibits Pig Farming in Kowloon; Villagers Request Reconsideration; Livelihood of Hundreds of Years, Relocation is Impossible; Huang Yangyou and Others Elected to Take Charge of Making Appeals</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is enforcing the order prohibiting pig farming by residents of Kowloon. Since receiving the Health Bureau's reply refusing to delay the date, the pig farming villagers of Kowloon have gathered for three consecutive days from the 21st to the 23rd, represented by various village gentry, to discuss and report the Chairman's reply and discuss solutions. The village gentry all believe that at a time when the government is desperately seeking food self-sufficiency, abruptly enforcing the ban is ××××. Moreover, tens of thousands of peninsula villagers who have relied on pig farming and planting for their livelihoods for hundreds of years have no other means of earning a living. If pig farming is banned, the planting of vegetables will also be unable to continue. Their future lives will become a real problem. Therefore, they have to continue to appeal to the authorities to revoke the ban so that tens of thousands of villagers can continue their livelihoods. Huang Yangyou and twelve others were immediately elected to take charge of making appeals.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Luncheon Meeting of the Hong Kong Rotary Club: Scientific Films Shown on the Spot, Next Week's Election of Next Term's Staff</h3>

Then, the film "The Lubrication Method of Gasoline Engines" was screened, using images to explain that friction occurs when objects rub against each other, causing resistance. This film was a sound film with accompanying explanations, with each scene explained in detail and vividly, so even though it belongs to the field of mechanical science, it was still very interesting. After the screening, member Rowland Lawrence thanked Esley on behalf of the club. Subsequently, Fok Ka announced that the election of new staff for the next term would be held next week, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>We Closely Surround Huicheng: Carrying Out a Large-Scale Annihilation Battle, Our Troops Fiercely Struggle in the Suburbs of Jiangmen, We Block the Gongyi Waterway So that Enemy Boats Cannot Move</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express News] In the Jiang (men) Hui (cheng) battle, our troops have been holding on fiercely for two days. The sounds of artillery fire have been heard continuously in the Zhongshan county area and between Gongyi. However, our soldiers are performing their duties bravely, advancing through the rain of bullets and bathing in blood, and pressing the enemy troops. On the 22nd, the enemy in Jiang and Hui felt that they could not take care of both ends and were on the verge of collapse. The military situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Closely Surrounding Huicheng</p>
<p>The army, advancing along Xinkai Road, successively recovered Dayun Mountain, Fenshui River, Daxiaomeihou, and continued to occupy Jinniu Mountain River Dike, once rushed into Huiminmen of Huicheng. Dozens of enemy troops, considering the objectives having been reached and fearing that the isolated troops would easily be taken advantage of by the enemy, then withdrew on their own initiative, closely guarding the four suburbs, and closely monitoring the enemy. On the 21st and 22nd, the enemy troops entrenched in the city stubbornly defended the city, bombarding our positions with steel cannons and machine guns, hoping to defend to the death. Our army also fiercely attacked the enemy with new-style field artillery. A fierce artillery battle took place for two days. Our army used positional warfare tactics and exerted its maximum power, always maintaining favorable positions.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle in the Suburbs of Jiangmen</p>
<p>Regarding the counterattack on Jiangmen along the Jiang, Fo, Xin, and He roads, our army is making good progress. Fierce battles are now taking place with the enemy in the Danzao Wucun area in the suburbs of Jiangmen. More than 100 enemies have been wiped out successively. It is reported that a part of our assault team is advancing towards Beijie to coordinate the attack on the urban area from the Jiangfo Road. Now our large army is still continuously opening up the front line, preparing for a large-scale annihilation battle. For the past two days, the sounds of fierce artillery fire between our troops and the enemy have been heard in Zhongshan County, which shows the intensity of the battle in the suburbs of Jiangmen.</p>
<p>Complete Waterway Blockade</p>
<p>In addition, our military authorities, in order to prevent the Jianghui enemy troops from trying to contain our army's advance, often use motorboats to harass our Gongyi Danshuikou and other places along the waterway. In order to combat this enemy's conspiracy, the Gongyi waterway is being blocked. The first phase of the project was completed last week, and the second phase of the project has now been completed. There are also some water mines deployed in the enemy area to prevent the enemy's motorboats from moving, so as to avoid worries, and to be able to concentrate on attacking Huicheng.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Invades Dongbao: Repelled Separately by Our Troops, Freight Transportation is Smooth Below Changping on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, The Coast of Baoan is Peaceful and There are No Enemy Traces in the Territory</h3>
<p>(Shenzhen Express News) On the south bank of the East River, our army team has been adopting a steady and solid strategy to advance towards the enemy in Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping. Giving the enemy creation, the enemy tried to contain our counter-offensive progress and frequently harassed various places. The enemy who invaded Dong (guan) Ze (an) on the 21st and 22nd has now been repelled separately by our team. According to a telephone call from the front, the enemy who came from Shilong and Wancheng on the morning of the 21st totaled more than 300 people, including dozens of cavalry and six or seven steel cannons, coming fiercely. However, it was found that the enemy army was determined to harass and contain, and after being intercepted by our team, they retreated immediately. Our team immediately tracked down and searched, and the entire enemy army was wiped out in the afternoon. At that time, on the railway side, our team pursued the defeated enemy who had fled to Shilong, and chased them to Jingshan, inflicting heavy blows and annihilating dozens more enemy troops. There are now no traces of the enemy in Huangli, Dongjing, Jingshan and other places. Traffic is normal below Changping on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and freight transportation is also smooth. As for the enemy in Xinqiao, Wu Xia, and Huangsonggang who invaded Baoan on the morning of the 22nd, after looting wildly in Huangsong in the afternoon, they continued to loot food and property from the village of Fuyong. At that time, the villagers in the nearby area fled to Xixiang Gushu. The enemy then pursued with cavalry, snatching dozens of dan of food and rice in Quxiang, and then withdrew towards Taiping along Baotai Road. It was found that the enemy had forced the villagers to accept the Taiping puppet organization's orders, submit military pay on a monthly basis, and conscript some young men, kill three villagers surnamed Wen, and rob villagers of a large amount of food and property. Now the entire territory of Baoan has no traces of the enemy on the 23rd, and the coastal area is also peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>It was also found that the commanders of the Taiping enemy army had brazenly demanded that Liang Baoren, the magistrate of Baoan County, hand over political power, otherwise they would decide to send a large army to invade in the shortest possible time in an attempt to intimidate. The people of the county have become accustomed to hearing such dangerous tricks from the enemy army, and have mostly ignored them, so people's hearts are calm as usual. In order to crush the enemy's conspiracy, Liang Baoren and Li Ruibai, the fourth and fifth major captains of the fourth district guerrilla column, have ordered their subordinates to maintain strict vigilance in Foziao, Xixiang, Gushu, Nantou and other places. If the enemy comes to invade, they will die.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Enemy Troops Humiliate Citizens</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express News) The enemy who occupied Guangzhou has recently lost at the front line and has angered the citizens. If their requests are slightly contrary to their wishes, they will arrest and beat them at will. Property and women are often subjected to xxxx. What is even worse is that the shops in each household are often broken into by enemy soldiers, xxxx, and then they leave. The citizens have suffered all kinds of harsh treatment, and the whole city has become a world of terror and desolation. However, the strength of our guerrillas in the suburbs is strong, and they often attack the enemy army.</p>
<h3>The Provincial Security Office Holds a Cadre Training Class and Enrolls More Than 500 Students</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express News] In order to give patriotic young people the opportunity to resist the enemy and save the country, the Guangdong Provincial Security Office has specially organized cadre training classes to impart military and political knowledge, so as to cultivate more young people who are committed to military resistance against the enemy and national reconstruction and implement the Three People's Principles, so as to send them to various troops to take up the work of junior cadres. Registration has begun, and the deadline is the 25th of this month. The number of recruits is 504, and 60 are on the waiting list.

Those who are eligible to apply are male youths who have graduated from senior high school or junior high school or have equivalent qualifications and are between the ages of 20 and 25.</p>
<h3>Crushing the Enemy's Policy of Appeasement</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Special Training] The enemy troops in the guerrilla area often transfer the property obtained from robbing Village A to Village B, and transfer the property from robbing Village C to Village D, in order to carry out their deceptive and poisonous policy of appeasement. Our people are extremely angry about this. The women who were lured back to their hometowns have fled again, and the young men have joined the regular army and guerrillas to kill the enemy. Now the provincial government is stepping up its efforts to promote politics in the war zone and disintegrate the enemy's traitorous conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Two Youths from Lingshan Voluntarily Enlist to Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Lingshan Communication) Nan Ke Village, Tuxiang Township, County, has two youths, Shi and Xiang Yu, who have recently been invaded by the enemy and are shocked by the meaning of the country's destruction and family destruction. On the 8th of the month, they resolutely took the road to Lingshan and transferred to Liancheng to ask a certain department to enlist to kill the enemy. Local people are now planning to ask the government to reward them.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Harasses the Coast of Heshan Again</h3>
<p>(Zhongshan Express News) Since the 20th, the enemy has taken advantage of motorboats and rubber boats from the Jiujiang Heqing area to harass Gulao, Shishi, Yantou, Haikou and other areas along the coast of Heshan, and fierce battles have taken place. There was still contact on the 21st. The Heshan team is now rushing to the coast to intercept. Our army in Shaping is closely guarding.

The original regiment police headquarters is still established.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Number of Bombs Dropped by Enemy Aircraft in Northern Guangdong Since the War of Resistance: A Blood Debt That Needs to be Cleared Urgently</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express News) Since the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, our full-scale war of resistance will be two years old. Since the 22nd month, the enemy aircraft has been wantonly wreaking havoc on our non-military areas where there are no resisting people.

<h3>The Fourth War Zone Announces That the Destruction of Highways Must Be Thorough so That the Enemy Cannot Use Our Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express News) Deng Longguang, the commander of the 64th Army, reported that the enemy recently invaded Heshan from Xinhui and advanced along the Xinhe Highway. Although the road was destroyed before the war, whenever the enemy encountered a gap, they would tie straw together into bundles to fill it, then add soil, and set up wooden boards on it for vehicles to pass through. According to this, Zhang Dai, the acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, quoted the instructions given by the chairman of the committee on the last item of the regulations on the method of destroying highways, saying that if there is ample time, the entire roadbed should be removed so that the enemy cannot use our inherent transportation lines as combat routes. Zhang specially ordered his subordinates to transfer the order to various commissioners and county magistrates, saying that the destruction of highways must be examined at any time and place, and the depth of the destruction of the roadbed should be increased as much as possible. Attention should also be paid to digging out the soil and placing it far away or in the river so that it is difficult for the enemy to use. Then, no matter what method the enemy uses, they will be hindered by this major destruction, and it will be difficult for them to reach it quickly. It is also reported that the highway destruction inspection team organized by the provincial government has also been ordered to step up its work to ensure that the destruction of each highway meets the standards.</p>
<p>[Kaiping Express News] Li Xipeng, the magistrate of Kaiping County, was recently ordered to continue to thoroughly destroy the highway to prevent enemy cavalry from invading. In recent days, he has summoned the township chiefs to discuss everything and ordered each township chief to immediately start construction to destroy the highway, so as to emphasize military affairs. It was found that the third district of the county had not thoroughly destroyed the highway, so County Magistrate Li sent a team to urge the construction to start on the same day, and those who violated the order would be severely punished.</p>
<h3>The Fanconghua Guerrilla Team is Active: The Enemy Army Invaded Huangqishan Twice, Using Aircraft to Cover the Attack But Failed</h3>
<p>(Huaxian Express News) Wu Guanhong, the commander of the Second Guerrilla Column, has recently sent troops deep into the enemy's rear to launch extensive guerrilla warfare in the Fanconghua area, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. Recently, each team was ordered to attack, and Wu's troops mostly operated in the Xinji Fengyong area, coordinating with the national army to fight, and achieving major results. Especially in the two battles of Huangqishan, the enemy was annihilated in large numbers. It was found that yesterday, the enemy attacked Huangqishan with more than 100 infantrymen and 30 to 40 cavalrymen. The first and second battalions of the fourth detachment of Wu's troops were guarding the north of the mountain. Because they occupied the superior position on the top of the mountain, the enemy could not advance. After a fierce battle, the enemy's situation gradually became unsustainable and was surrounded by our troops. At 3:00 PM, the enemy reinforcements from Yubantan arrived, opening up more than 100 infantry and artillerymen, attaching many steel cannons, and firing at the mountain. After that, they rushed in with two squads of troops, but were also wiped out, with only one person surviving. After a mutual battle until 7:00 PM, the enemy retreated towards Xinjie before returning to their original defense. It is estimated that the enemy suffered more than 40 casualties, and the team also suffered the injury of two company commanders, Zhou Chaojin and Chen Dazhu, and 862 houses were damaged. Yingshan dropped 3 dead soldiers. In the second attack, the enemy attacked the defense area of the fifth detachment with more than 100 infantrymen, 20 to 30 cavalrymen, and multiple fixed cannons, and used multiple aircraft to cover and threaten from the sky. After a mutual battle for about two hours, the team retreated to Yazongling to avoid major sacrifices. The enemy did not know the truth of our side, and soon also retreated towards Xinjie. Now Wu's troops are still active in the Qiconghua area, waiting for the opportunity to attack the enemy.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Disturbs Xinhui: Villagers Flee One After Another</h3>
<p>(Zhongshan Express News) After Jiangmen Huicheng fell, the enemy in the nearby villages engaged in xxxx, doing everything. The villagers in the 5th, 7th, and 10th districts along the Jiangfo Road resent the enemy's intrusion at any time, and the bandits and local bandits have taken the opportunity to loot everywhere. Ten rooms are nine empty. It is now found that the people in Shitou, Shuangshe, Fengshe, Yishan, Nanshan, Tangxia, Xinmiao, Tongjing, Dayao, Mulang, Zhoujun, Huangzhuang, Gubomiao, Xinshi and other places are not living well, and some have become starving people, which is unspeakable. There are more than ten bandit dens between the villages and Houtang Overseas. Due to living conditions, the people in the inland would rather die trapped in the countryside than flee to Hong Kong, Macao, and other counties to try to struggle again. Therefore, the villagers near Tangxia Huangzhuang have fled one after another, passing through Zhoujun Customs and crossing Houtang to Xiaohang in Zhongshan, led by the so-called "patrolling horse", charging each person a river yuan (including protection fees and water feet), so each "patrolling horse" has made a lot of profit.</p>
<h3>Men Should Be Ashamed: A Young Woman Kills the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Nanhai Express News) The people in the Foshan urban area have been repeatedly ravaged and destroyed by the enemy army, and everyone is heartbroken. On the 18th of this month, a couple, Zhao Shanbao and his wife, were passing through Pujun Market when they happened to meet two enemy soldiers. Zhao was arrested and driven into a vacant shop, hoping to xxxx. Zhao's wife, Chen Bixie, was the daughter of a certain technician and was skilled in fighting. At the critical moment, she took the opportunity to kick an enemy soldier and knock him down, seized the bayonet on the enemy's body, and stabbed him to death with her hand. The remaining one was also knocked down by Dong and fled out the door. The matter was discovered by the fake police, who reported that the enemy army had sent 30 to 40 military police to arrive, cut off traffic, and searched the area, and arrested one innocent man and woman suspected of being sent to the enemy headquarters for joint trial.</p>

<h3>"One Year" Staged in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Xue Ying</p>
<p>Hong Kong will also stage the play, both to raise funds for the Salvation Daily</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) "One Year" is a four-act play newly written by Xia Yan. This play was written for Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others to go abroad to raise funds for the Fifth Group Army's wounded soldier factories, etc. Mr. Xia Yan presides over the Salvation Daily and is already very busy, but because this matter is of great importance, and Jin Shan and others were worried about not having a new play to perform, they repeatedly urged and prompted him, so he rushed to write it in his spare time.</p>
<p>Although the play was rushed out in his spare time, "One Year" is still unanimously recognized as an outstanding new realistic drama. The war does not have a single formulaic salvation face, but it is overflowing with a strong atmosphere of confidence and optimism about the victory of the war of resistance. The clear depiction of the characters and the clever and powerful ending are major reasons why this play has become a masterpiece. It is expected that when this play is performed in the United States, it will make the American people more aware of China's strength and indomitable spirit, which will be no problem.</p>
<p>It is said that in addition to Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others performing in the United States, the play was recently performed at the Guotai Grand Theater in Chongqing. With a grand lineup, the business was extremely good. The asking price for honorary seats was fifty yuan per pair, but the result was still a full house, even the glass was crushed. Wang Pusheng, who managed the front desk, wore his lieutenant colonel uniform, but still could not maintain order in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>This public performance was to raise funds for the Salvation Daily, and the surplus after settlement was more than seven thousand yuan. The cast was very strong. The director was Ying Yunxiao, and the actors included Zhao Dan, who played the strong and righteous old man Liu Ailu, Bai Yang, who played the bride, Shu Xiuwen, who played the aunt Xiu Sheng, Wang Weiyi, who played the defeatist Ming Yang, and Ying Yin, who played Yu Zhihua, a salvation member living in a pavilion room. Other roles, such as De Fang and A Shu, were also the best choices at the time. This can be seen from the fact that Bai Yang only played a bride with few scenes. As for the background of the play, the first two acts take place at a small station along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and the third and fourth acts take place in Shanghai after the fall.</p>
<p>[Note] In addition to Chongqing, recent news has been received that someone in Hong Kong is preparing to stage it.</p>

This year, he won the award again and was able to personally accept this honor, so he was particularly happy. As for the best supporting actor and actress, they were Walter Brennan and Fay Bainter. The acting skills of the former in "Kentucky" and the latter in "Jezebel" were worthy of receiving the "Oscar" without shame. Under the eyes of thousands of pairs of eyes and cameras, they were each presented with the large "Oscar" Gold Statue by Mr. Frederick and Mr. Haverky.</p>
<p>In addition, there were two men and women who also received this supreme honor. The man was cartoonist Walt Disney, who won the award for producing "Snow White." He was awarded a large "Oscar" and seven small "Oscars" by Shirley Temple, symbolizing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The woman was teenage singer Deanna Durbin, who was awarded a medium "Oscar" by Edgar Bergen, the father of "Mortimer Snerd" Charlie McCarthy (photo published on the ninth of this newspaper). Deanna's award was due to her successful performance from childhood to adolescence.</p>
<p>Among the many guests, the most eye-catching were Manuel Oberon, the son of the President of the United States (James Roosevelt, who recently joined the film industry and collaborated with Goldwyn), together with married couple Hedy Lamarr and Gene Markey, who had not been married long, also appeared together. Dolores del Río, who had not been divorced long, and Whitney Locke Moore, a film executive who specializes in discovering new talents, came together.

<h3>Shantou · In the Midst of a Frenzied Air Raid!</h3>
<p>— Chen Xi</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Shantou by this newspaper) Shantou is in the midst of a frenzied air raid. The rubble from the bombing a few days ago (May 4-May 7) has not yet been cleared, and the bloodstains of our compatriots have not yet dried when, today (the 17th), they attacked again without any scruples!</p>
<p>At 8:30 a.m., the emergency alarm sounded like the wailing of ghosts. The short and miserable sound swirled in the air. Because of the many bloody lessons, people began to panic. They ran, cried, and stared blankly, as if a great disaster was imminent. The air raid shelters were crowded with people. Mothers hugged their children and trembled. Young men cursed...</p>
<p>Then, my keen hearing heard the "嗡嗡嗡..." sound of the planes. I put down my work and stood up to look out the window. The sun had already hidden its tearful eyes behind the miserable black clouds. The sky was extremely dim, and a gray curtain covered the earth. Usually, people take the old and young to flee to the reefs on the opposite bank every day, but who would have thought that such weather would provide an opportunity for an attack?</p>
<p>Three ×planes flew proudly extremely low. That sound pierced people's hearts like an awl. This is the prelude to the ferocity of the ×planes, and it is also a kind of omen in the space between people's birth and death!</p>
<p>Sure enough, the sound of continuous explosions "隆隆" spread, and even the windows were shaking. This is the sound that people are familiar with. When people hear this sound, they will instinctively shake, and they will immediately realize that buildings are collapsing one after another, and batches of compatriots are dying!</p>
<p>The machine gunners of the air defense unit fired back "咯咯". The cunning ×also swept down with machine guns. In this way, Shantou fell into an extremely terrifying deep trap. Apart from this terrifying sound, there was no sound at all. The space was only filled and permeated with the smell of gunpowder and blood!... (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Pygmalion (6) Produced by MGM, Original by George Bernard Shaw, Starring Leslie Howard, Wendy Hiller</h3>
<p>He and Pickering went to his mother's house to tell her, but she was not sympathetic and said, "She did those things for you, and you didn't thank her? Didn't praise her? And she threw a pair of slippers at you? If it were me, I really wouldn't forgive you like that!" She then took them into her own room. "Now promise me to behave properly." She then opened the door.</p>
<p>Eliza was sitting inside doing needlework. "Good morning, General Pickering. Good, you told her."</p>
<p>"!" The female reporter exclaimed. Higgins walked up to Pickering and said disappointedly, "This trick has been exposed."</p>
<p>Just then, the Queen Mother arrived. Everyone went to greet her. Suddenly Pickering said, "Higgins, look!"</p>
<p>An official led Eliza to the Queen. Eliza went forward to salute with a natural and unhurried manner.</p>
<p>The Queen reached out and stroked her cheek. "Beautiful girl," she said softly, "my son will definitely like to dance with you."</p>
<p>Eliza bowed her head and agreed. She began to dance with the Prince in a graceful manner.</p>
<p>Karpathy stood beside Higgins and smiled.</p>
<p>The female reporter begged, "Mr. Karpathy, please tell me, who exactly is Miss Doolittle?" She took out a pencil and paper from her bag.</p>
<p>But Karpathy shook his head, "This is my secret," he paused for a moment, "but I'm going to tell the Queen, she should know."</p>
<p>Higgins only felt a chill down his spine.</p>
<p>Karpathy continued, "She is——pretending!"</p>
<p>Alas, Higgins really didn't expect such a situation tonight.</p>
<p>Karpathy also said, "And she's not even English, no real Englishman can speak so beautifully. Only foreigners can do this with teaching. She's Hungarian." At this point, the guests nearby were paying attention to what he was saying. They were all very surprised to hear it.</p>

<h3>South China Football Team Reschedules Southern Tour, Charity Match Held This Saturday, South China and All-Stars Form Battle Lines</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) Carrying a new honor and about to depart on a southern tour, the South China football team was originally scheduled to start its first leg today, but "everything is ready except for the east wind," so the departure date has been postponed and will not be able to depart until the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>The charity match that was not held last Saturday due to rain can now be resumed due to the postponement of South China's departure. It will be performed at Jia Shan at 5:15 p.m. this Saturday.</p>
<p>It is still South China versus the All-Stars, and the lineups on both sides are slightly different from the previous ones. South China has been formed more rationally, and the opponent has only changed a few people.</p>
<p>South China has stopped leaving again, and has finally formed this football relationship with the general fans. Moreover, the expeditioners will not return until September. This meeting with the fans on the field will definitely strive for a performance, leaving a good pre-departure memory.</p>
<p>If both sides can fight with the original lineup at that time, it is expected that the situation will be pleasing to the eye. The two formations are arranged as follows:</p>
<p>(South China)</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Li Guowei Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao Guo Yingqi</p>
<p>Luo Douwen Zhao Rong Ping Huitang Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Reserves: Yang Shuiyi, Mai Zhaomo, Liu Congsheng, Chen Dehui,</p>
<p>(All-Stars)</p>
<p>Dejiashen</p>
<p>Li Anna Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng Norris Xia Xian</p>
<p>Hou Chengtuo Zhuo Shijin Maurice Tuo Ban Yan Shidulang</p>
<p>Reserves: Li Deqi, Haniweilu, Zhuan Nibo Lu, He Xi,</p>
<p>...The reason for South China's postponement of this southern tour is not for anything else, but that there are still problems in the selection. Team Leader Mo has put a lot of effort into it, so he finally canceled today's departure. Here is some of what I know about the selection:</p>
<p>...Left winger Luo Douwen may not be able to make the trip due to some reasons. However, if Li Huitang joins the army and goes on an expedition, Douwen has always been favored by him, so he may be able to go with him.</p>
<p>..."Uncle Lu"'s son Lu Dakeng very much wants to participate in the precepts and go out to broaden his knowledge, so Uncle Lu has been planning for his son with all his strength, hoping that he can be selected to fulfill his wish. However, the overseas expedition is cautious in selecting materials, and Dakeng is still not qualified to enter the 'Hall of Elegance' at the moment, and I am afraid that he will eventually be in the list of abandoned materials.</p>
<p>...Guanghua's pillar Hou Rongsheng has decided to join South China and go on an expedition with the army. He will not enter the Guanghua gate again when he returns in the future.</p>
<p>...Mai Zhaohan's foot injury has not fully recovered, so he had to let the team go first and could not go with them. He will go to Singapore to rejoin the team after his injury recovers and join the expedition to the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>...South China specially asked the manager of the Swedish foreign company, Xia Lijian, to ask for leave for Li Huitang. According to Mr. Xia, there is no problem with Huitang's request for leave. However, Tan Jun'gan, who also works in the company, cannot go with him due to something. Lin Depu was very disappointed that he could not go on the expedition. He complained to Huitang a few days ago, but Huitang was only a member of the expedition and could not help.</p>
<p>...I heard that Eastern's left winger Hou Chengtuo has also been invited to tour the south. However, Chengtuo is a pillar of the East, and it is quite a problem to stay or leave, so he is still in consultation with South China.</p>

<h3>Basketball Federation Resolves, Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament Starts on the 29th of This Month, Order of the Group B Finals Completed</h3>
<p>The Basketball Federation held the Shenbao Cup Committee Meeting and arranged the Group B qualifying finals at the Hong Kong News Reporters Association last night.

<h3>School Volleyball Tournament, Senior Yinghuang Defeats Wah Yan, Junior Peiying Defeats Southwest, Little Children Paul Defeats Yinghuang</h3>
<p>In yesterday's school volleyball tournament, a total of three games were held in the senior, junior, and children's grades. In the senior Wah Yan vs. Yinghuang, Wah Yan only played with seven people due to insufficient numbers. Yinghuang, on the other hand, was fully staffed, so the strength was very different. After the competition, Yinghuang pressed from the left and right, and Wah Yan was busy parrying. It lost 0 to 3, the first set was 4 to 21, the second set was 15 to 21, and the third set was 16 to 21. The two formations are as follows:</p>

<p>Huang Zicheng Zeng Duanri</p>
<p>In the junior Peiying vs. Southwest, the two sides were quite stalemate, but Peiying was strong, both offensively and defensively. Lu Fang was in the center to coordinate, and Zhou Gengshen, Huang Huahan, Zhu Zongquan, and Huang Jiyao's smashes were often successful. Gong Dechao, Liu Shumian, Wen Zhaobiao, Guan Baoze, Ling Zixin, and others from Southwest also tried their best to resist, but Peiying's military appearance was strong, and Southwest could not parry and eventually lost 0 to 1. The first set was 17 to 21, the second set was 18 to 21, and the third horse was 11 to 21. The barriers are as follows:</p>
<p>Peiying Southwest</p>

<p>Economic Column Comments</p>
<h3>The So-Called [Huaxing Commercial Bank] and Its Role</h3>
<p>— Han Hui</p>
<p>However, after Chinese merchants collected this military currency, they quickly went to Shanghai or other commercial ports to purchase Japanese loans and Japanese goods from Japanese merchants. Although the import of Japanese goods is increasing dramatically, its purpose of obtaining industrial raw materials and food for free has not been achieved. On the contrary, it has wasted the foreign exchange export resources that could have been obtained. Although Japanese small and medium-sized merchants do not dare to openly refuse military currency, they are already complaining. The original intention of Japan was that this military currency could alleviate its crisis of malignant inflation, but now it has completely failed. Therefore, the "Huaxing Bank" established this time is formally different from the "United Reserve Bank" in the north. The main differences are two:</p>
<p>First, the difference in nature. The "United Reserve Bank" was jointly established by the "Beijing Provisional Government" and by forcing various banks in the north. "Huaxing" is invested by the "Nanjing Reformed Government" and the six major Japanese banks. Although the former can establish credit loans with the Chaoyang Bank, it is not directly invested by Japanese banks. The latter is very clearly a joint stock company of the six major Japanese banks. Moreover, the word "Commercial" is added under the words "Huaxing", which is even more comparable to the so-called "National Bank" nature of the "United Reserve Bank".</p>
<p>Second, the difference in denomination: The "United Reserve Bank" notes are at par with the Japanese yen and function as a substitute for legal tender (its failure has been described above). It is said that "Huaxing" notes use legal tender as a reserve and are not linked to the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>As for the function of issuing "Huaxing" notes, there are approximately four items:</p>
<p>(1) Japan uses "Huaxing" notes in the Japanese-occupied areas and absorbs foreign exchange in the Shanghai "black market" to erode the reserve funds of legal tender, in order to increase its payment power for its invasion of China military expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Japan wants to use "Huaxing" notes to plunder industrial raw materials and food from the occupied areas on a long-term and unlimited basis, and refuse Chinese merchants to directly purchase Japanese goods with "Huaxing" notes, so that Japanese small and medium-sized merchants will not have the pain of receiving military currency again.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese puppets use "Huaxing" notes to pay part of the expenses of the Japanese troops stationed in China and the expenses of the puppet organizations, in order to make up for the financial panic of both the Japanese and the puppets.</p>
<p>(4) "Huaxing" Bank will be the agency for Japan to control foreign exchange and foreign trade in Shanghai and Jiangnan. It will force export merchants to sell foreign exchange to "Huaxing". In this way, on the one hand, it can replenish the reserves of the Japanese yen, and on the other hand, it can use the monopoly of Changjiang (Yangtze River) and inland waterway transportation to promote the import of Japanese goods and squeeze out the market for European and American goods, that is, it wants to increase its capital accumulation by expanding commodity exports.</p>
<p>The above four functions can be said to be progressing simultaneously. Its ultimate goal is nothing more than rejecting the economic interests of the United Kingdom and the United States, destroying the legal tender system, and completing the pipe dream that the Shanghai financial market will also join the yen bloc. However, this kind of goal is absolutely impossible to realize.</p>
<p>First, if "Huaxing" notes are used to exchange for legal tender, because the credit of legal tender is stable and the amount of "Huaxing" notes issued is unlimited, the people in the occupied areas will inevitably hoard legal tender, and the tragic decline in the price of "Huaxing" notes is inevitable.</p>
<p>Second, as a result of the excessive issuance of "Huaxing" notes, the price of goods in the occupied areas will inevitably soar. Not only will Japan's procurement of agricultural products from Jiangnan to fill industrial raw materials and food be hit, but also the reduction in the purchasing power of people in the occupied areas will greatly reduce the import of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Third, the plummeting price of "Huaxing" notes and the soaring prices will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of Chinese merchants in the war zone, and the finances of the puppet organization, which rely on urban merchants, will inevitably become even more panic-stricken, and the method of providing supplies for the Japanese army locally will inevitably become more difficult.</p>
<p>Fourth, if Japan uses "Huaxing" Bank to control foreign exchange in Shanghai, it is objectively difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>The above contradictions are the inevitable result of the issuance of "Huaxing" notes. Not only will it not help Japan's economic institutions, but it will accelerate its collapse. Japan has seen this crisis, so it has not yet implemented a plan to actually control Shanghai's foreign exchange. It wants to use other means to induce the cooperation of Chinese and American merchants. The hope of its success is even more. The "Federated Reserve" was the prelude, but there has been no follow-up to this day, which shows the high degree of self-doubt.</p>

<h3>A Defense of New Poetry</h3>
<p>— Xing Guangzu</p>
<p>Those who promoted new literature in the early days went through many difficulties and finally cut down those "stubborn" vines. Over the years, relying on the cultivation and irrigation of many new writers, many beautiful flowers have already been produced in the garden of new literature. However, in recent years, there have been plants grown from the same seed that are hindering the growth of other plants in this garden, which I think is a pity.</p>
<p>I have always thought that the entire new literary movement is a movement of new poetry. If you don't believe it, we can cite some examples. Some essays were written in vernacular Chinese, such as the essays of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Cao Xueqin and Shi Nai'an were pioneers in writing novels in vernacular Chinese. Yuan Dynasty operas (especially those recitatives) were written in vernacular Chinese. As for writing poetry in vernacular Chinese, it is purely a product of the new literary movement. Although Bai Juyi wanted to make his poems "understandable to old women," it was only a theory of poetry, not a practice. Moreover, if we look at Mr. Hu Shih's article "Bian Shang Liang Shan" in the Collection of Literary Theories of the Good Companion New Literature System, we will understand that his literary revolution advocated writing poetry in vernacular Chinese as the backbone. Therefore, new poetry is a special product of the new literary movement and the mastermind of the new literary movement; those who denigrate new poetry are denigrating the new literary movement.</p>
<p>Those who denigrate new poetry, in addition to the "possessed" figures mentioned by Peng Xiaoshu earlier, surprisingly include some playwrights. Ding Xilin satirized new poetry in his one-act play "A Wasp," but it seems to have been eroded by time and is no longer noticed. More recently, A Ying's "Spring Breeze Autumn Rain" used the voice of Professor Ni in the play to praise his lover Feng Yun with several "crooked" poems, and the recent play adapted by Feng Zhizhong called "Pretending" has a large section that mocks new poetry and pretends to be very powerful. However, although new poetry has gone through the poisonous sting of a wasp, it still exists巍然. Spring Breeze Autumn Rain is only temporarily confusing people. As for pretending, it only makes people feel its affectation and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I remember that R.L. Stevenson once said: "I often suspect that public taste is a mixed product, a combination of adherence to old habits and hypocrisy." For new poetry, those stubborn factions take a contemptuous attitude, precisely because their adherence to old habits is too deep. As for those literary figures who satirize new poetry, it is only because they lack a deep understanding and research on new poetry. Either they do not read new poetry, or they only taste new poetry superficially. Both factions have not entered the door and are vulgar people. Not enough to talk about poetry. "Saying Poetry in Brief" once said, "Good poetry is the medicine for vulgar people." I also hold the same view. These "vulgar" people must eliminate their discriminatory psychology and read more new poetry collections.</p>
<p>Perhaps the general playwrights who satirize new poetry do not have any preconceived notions. Using a little satire in a play is just like a drugstore advertisement, just to attract more audiences. For example, a poem written in Feng Zhizhong's "Pretending" (no quotation marks are necessary): "Ah, ah, ah! The sky does not leave, and the earth does not stay. That's okay. I secretly glanced at you, and your two light bulb-like eyes stole my heart. Thief, thief!" "I remember this from the lines of the actors of the Sino-French Drama Society, or there may be errors." He inserted this passage in the play, perhaps to exchange the laughter of the audience for incongruous words. If this is the case, then we must also demand the author's sound artistic conscience.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also reflect on ourselves to examine the existing new poetry scene. Of course, we cannot deny that many new poems are indeed flawed and naive. Over the years, the advancement has been like a slow ox, which will indeed make people who love to watch the excitement anxious. However, I always believe that naivety is not enough to criticize new poetry. Time is still long, and great instruments are always late to be completed. (As long as you don't die young, you will always see the season when it blooms and thrives. (Moreover, in new literature, whether it is essays, novels, or dramas, they all suffer from the same symptoms. Who can say that Cao Yu's "Sunrise" and Sun Yutang's eight-hundred-line long poem "Baoma" are not superior or inferior? Here, I, like Mr. Shao Xunmei, want to use Mr. Lin Yutang's tone to say: "The success of new literature is also the success of new poetry."</p>
<p>The reason why new poetry is not well-known in new literature is, according to some people: "We only have people who write new poetry, but no people who read new poetry." The editor of any magazine always feels that there are the most submissions for new poetry; while all booksellers feel that the sales of poetry magazines and poetry collections are the least. According to my speculation, the reason why this deformed phenomenon exists is nothing more than two points: one is because poets are mostly solitary and self-appreciating, and the best poets who do not like to publicize are usually the most clumsy advertising promoters. And poets have their own complete personality and noble taste, and they will never cater to the masses and try their best to accommodate them. Another point is that those who engage in literature and art or poetry critics lack sympathy and encouragement. This kind of passionless criticism and cold ridicule is usually the trick of those snobs.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to thank those who ridicule new poetry, because "satire is a friend with good intentions," as Churchill said. At the same time, we must also advise those who ridicule new poetry, because Bacon said well: "Those who have a temperament of ridiculing others and who make people afraid of the sharpness of their wit must worry about people remembering them forever."</p>
<h3>Song Without Sound</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>When I'm lonely, the coldness in my heart can't help but create empty sorrows from fantasy, like falling into the deep cracks of the earth, falling into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>A cold body stirs up silent thoughts.</p>
<p>I want to sing, sing a song without sound.</p>
<p>I remember (actually a beautiful and touching lie) many years ago, heaven and earth were the same, and there was no distinction between humans and gods. The spring wind is like a wisp of light smoke, floating a goddess-like figure in the air – do you believe it? Do you believe that there has ever been peace on earth?</p>
<p>Friends, don't wander – besides the goddess, you should also know that there are devils. Devils, yes, devils were also rampant for a while before sunset. It smashed the statue of the goddess and also broke the high monument of peace. But you should also understand that the sun rises from the east, and although it is powerful at noon, it finally sets in the west.</p>
<p>I also remember the scenery I loved to watch most when I was young, the sunset on the lake.</p>
<p>It's Xuanwu Lake. In the cracks of the willow branches, in the red clouds, I saw the blood wheel sink under the bricks and stones of the Taicheng. At that time, the color of the lake, the air of the lake, and the rhythm of the lake made up a landscape painting by Apollo.</p>
<p>Also in the corridor in front of the Yilan Hall of Beihai, on the banks of Fangshan, to the left and right of the Five Dragon Pavilion, I once left a not deep or light trace. Now it is March weather again, and the beautiful scenery of the sunset is on the market again. In the deep cracks of the earth, in the bottomless abyss, I picked up a piece of memory. Nanjing and Beiping, although not my hometown, are still kind homelands, worth taking out a trace of sentiment from this piece of memory and leaving it on the eyeballs and beside the nerves, for me to rely on when I am lonely.</p>
<p>I want to sing, sing a song without sound.</p>
<p>But I hear a bass sound in the distance, chanting the power of life.</p>
<p>Look, a blue flower floats from the sky – it is a star point that the goddess sprinkles on the blue sky. It is a wisp of soft hair on the head of the universe – it is the source of life in heaven and earth.</p>
<p>When I remember the beautiful sunset scenery that I was happy to see in the old days, I smiled. In my meditation, the sun floats on the water, playing a cheerful tune. Passing through the water, in the depths of the mud, there are also traces of devils sinking to the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>Isn't it true that although the sun is powerful at noon, it finally sets in the west.</p>
<p>I want to sing, sing a song without sound.</p>
<p>But a cold body embraces the silent thoughts: Raising my head, I see a blue flower again, that eternal beauty.</p>
<h3>"Charity Sale" and "Charity Giving"</h3>
<p>— Ding San</p>
<p>Recently, students from a certain school in Shanghai sewed handkerchiefs, made paper flowers, and held charity sales to donate money. This shows that young students have a way to save the country. Doing small-scale production, small-scale charity sales, and small-scale donations like this is also a way to save the country, without necessarily having to go to the front lines to wave flags and shout.</p>
<p>Previously, Class A of the first grade of that school [a total of more than forty people] raised more than sixty yuan, bought eighteen dozen pairs of black socks, and walked a long distance to the Isolated Battalion one Sunday afternoon to offer comfort. When buying socks, the owner of the sock factory heard that they were going to comfort the Isolated Army, and that the Isolated Army was in need of socks (this they learned after inquiring by letter), so he added two more dozens, making a total of twenty dozens. These students selling socks from their own pockets to offer comfort can be said to be "charity giving," and the sock factory owner adding socks as a gift is naturally also "charity giving." Why "charity giving"? Because those more than three hundred isolated soldiers fought to the death to defend the country, bled to love the country, and in the future, they will certainly be able to fight for the country again. In short, it is for the sake of "saving the country."</p>
<p>In the past two months, I have "charity-sold" and "charity-given," but due to the complexity of trivial matters, mental stagnation, and the addition of chills and fever, and headaches, I have not been able to properly pick up a pen to do "business," so I have not followed the "cultural workers' charity sale movement," which I really feel ashamed of. However, I have provided articles "charity-given" to the publications and wall newspapers organized by the students four or five times. Giving "charity-given" articles several times in this way may seem unrelated to the country, but in fact, it has a considerable relationship—for the sake of a special influence, even a very small part of the influence!</p>
<p>"Charity sales" are completely "donations," so those who "charity-sell" should also have a "donation" mindset, and not dislike the roughness of the goods, but should generously take out a few more coins.</p>
<p>As for "charity giving," sending money and sending goods are naturally good, but sending strength and sending spirit are also not bad. As long as it is beneficial to the war of resistance and national construction, then no matter what is sent, no matter to whom it is sent, it is good. For people like me who cannot make ends meet, to be honest, although I cannot send a lot of money and goods, I can send strength and send spirit.</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, many soldiers have given their flesh and blood, their lives, to the country. Those who have not lost their lives, and those who have extra strength, extra spirit, extra money, and those who are prosperous and making a fortune from the war of resistance, if they are still unwilling to "charity give," then they are not worthy of being citizens of China, and they should be ashamed!</p>
<p>Therefore, I advocate that the movement of "charity sales" and donating money should be expanded and continued, but further, we should intensify the movement of "charity giving" donating money, donating goods, donating strength, and donating spirit, expand it, and promote it!</p>
<p>Everyone, let us rise up for the war of resistance and national construction and "charity-sell" and "charity-give"!</p>
<h3>Selling Beans (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhe</p>
<p>—Grandma's Story—</p>
<p>Orders came down from above to attack Qingzhen.</p>
<p>Originally, we were in the business of attacking, so naturally we should proceed. However, Captain Wang Mingyuan and several other captains, after discussing, could not help but hesitate, because we did not know the real situation in Qingzhen. We could not make complete arrangements, so we could not go rashly. I said, this matter still requires asking Grandma.</p>
<p>As soon as I mentioned Grandma, everyone laughed. "Okay, go and invite Grandma over right away," Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>Grandma, not knowing what she was doing, dusted off her clothes and came out from inside.</p>
<p>"Are you familiar with Qingzhen?" Wang Mingyuan asked.</p>
<p>"Very familiar; I have a niece living in that town."</p>
<p>"Do you know how many 'people' there are, how many guns, how many cannons in Qingzhen now?"</p>
<p>"I don't know about that."</p>
<p>"Do you have a way to find out?"</p>
<p>Grandma thought for a moment and nodded, saying, "I have a way; give me three days to reply, okay?"</p>
<p>After agreeing on this, she went to prepare, seemingly busy all night. The next day, she carried several bags of things alone and went to her niece Qian Asen's house.</p>
<p>She said to Qian Asen, "Recently, there has been no spending money at home, and I was thinking of coming to the town to do some small business." She poured out the things in the cloth bag. When Qian Asen saw it, it turned out to be various kinds of edible broad beans. Qian Asen didn't think much of it, because such things are often done by real rural old women.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, she borrowed a shallow-rimmed large basket from Qian Asen, put all kinds of beans in it, and went to the street to sell them. She had already inquired that the place where those people were stationed was the Public Cocoon Firm, so she went straight to the large teahouse opposite the Cocoon Firm.</p>
<p>After selling some broad beans briefly in the teahouse, she walked to the window facing the street and stared at the gate of the Cocoon Firm across the street without leaving. People were standing guard at the entrance of the Cocoon Firm, and many people were going in and out. She stared intently, as if looking for a familiar face, and sometimes forgot about the beans when someone called her.</p>
<p>"Old woman, why aren't you doing business and just staring at the opposite side?" A bored teahouse customer said this. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shi Dakai's True Poem</h3>
<p>— Luo Yong</p>
<p>On May 17th, from Zitanli, Mr. Zou Xiao's "Shi Dakai's Poems" mentioned my humble compilation of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poems and Essays, so I will also talk about it.</p>
<p>It is indeed true that Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was skilled in poetry and prose, but eighty or ninety percent of the works that have been passed down are forgeries. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poems and Essays includes about five or six of his articles. Strictly speaking, only the official certificate issued to Prime Minister Yang Fuguang is a true relic. However, this official certificate was probably written by his staff and cannot be considered Shi Dakai's own work. Even the one or two essays copied from the "Rebel" Situation Compilation are undoubtedly true, but at the same time, they are also the work of his staff. In addition, after examining several official documents using the official system and customs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, it can be determined that they are works forged by later generations. Even those famous sentences like "Endure allowing the clothing and culture of the superior nation to be submerged by the barbarians; Join together the heroes of the Central Plains, and return our rivers and mountains to us," although passionate and慷慨, even Mr. Liang Qichao was deceived and praised them. In fact, they are still forgeries by later generations, not Shi Wing King's own work. As for Shi Dakai's poems, from Gao Tianmei's Shi Dakai's Poetry Collection to Lu Yeye's Shi Dakai's Poetry Collection, to my humble compilation of Poems and Essays, although there are some differences in what is collected, Mr. Liu Yazi's letter to me proves that they are all forged by Mr. Gao Tianmei. (Even those two famous sentences "My ambition has not been fulfilled, and people have already suffered; There are tearful marks everywhere in the southeast" are also forged.) This is the strongest evidence. From this, it can be said that all the poems of Shi Dakai that we have seen so far are forgeries by later generations, and not a single one is true. (As for Xu Zhiyan's embellished Shi Dakai's Diary, it is completely a novelist's fabrication and is not credible. Scholars have already made a final judgment on this and there is no need to elaborate.) If that is the case, does it mean that Shi Dakai, who could write poetry, did not leave a single poem behind? That is not entirely the case. Shi Dakai does have a true poem, which is still deeply engraved on the stone wall of Bailong Cave in Guanshan County, Guangxi. This poem was written by Shi Dakai when he visited Bailong before entering Sichuan. In front of it is Shi's preface, along with a five-character律詩 he wrote. Behind it are ten poems by his staff Zhang Suimou and others, and a poem by Liu Yunqing of Hunan. In addition to these poems, there is also a seven-character古詩 by Jiang You Li Langgu, Minister of the Household Department of the Wing Palace, entitled "Visiting Bailong Cave in the Late Autumn of the Year Yiwei, Cherishing the Past." All of the above poems were carefully copied and sent to me in June of the 26th year of the Republic of China by Mr. Chen Qingyu, the magistrate of Yishan County. Although there are transcriptions circulating outside, there are many errors. What I rely on is the original stone inscription, which is of course reliable. Unfortunately, the fourth edition of Poems and Essays after the national crisis has already been printed and cannot be included, so it can only be compiled in the sequel to Poems and Essays. At the same time, I am currently writing a biography of the figures in the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and have written an article about Shi Wing King's subordinates based on these stone inscriptions. Now, I will copy Shi Dakai's preface and poem below so that we can all admire the true works of a national hero.</p>
<p>The preface states: "In the tenth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Gengshen, the army was stationed in Qingyuan. At the time of late spring, I took advantage of my political leisure to inspect the fragrant suburbs with the high-ranking officials. The mountains and rivers competed in beauty, and the 革木爭妍. I climbed this ancient cave, and poems were arranged like jade, and the rhyme was refined and elegant. I then saw Liu Yunqing's sentence on the white wall, which implied lofty meaning and used heroic words, and had the general idea of rejecting Buddha and eliminating evil. I greatly appreciated it, so I ordered his poem to be engraved on stone as a warning to those who are obsessed with immortals and Buddhas. I and the officials also composed several chapters on the original rhyme, all of which were engraved on stone to commemorate the tour." The poem says: "Standing up and climbing the high mountains, Lifting my eyes to shine on the distant sky. Destroying Buddha and worshiping the Heavenly Emperor, Moving people back to the ancient ways. Commanding the army and praising the bravery, Playing in the cave and admiring the poetic heroes. The sword's aura soared to the stars, The light of literature shot at the rainbow of the sun."</p>
