<p>社評</p>
<h3>勿以經濟拯救日×</h3>
<p>師出有名，直爲壯；抑不惟名實之辦，曲直之分不容假借而已；誰爲戎首，責任歸焉。中國爲求生存而抗戰；爲維護國族之獨立自由而戰，此必天下後世所共認；顧日本何爲而戰？</p>
<p>戰之初，日本謂中國之遼吉黑三省爲彼生命綫所在，故爲爭生命　而戰；夫以鄰國之人民領土富藏爲生命線而欲以武力攘爲已有，曲甯待言。戰之中途，日本謂中國共產化，彼爲剿共而戰；夫中國以三民主義立國，雖共產黨亦宗奉之，可知共產化說之爲誣妄；况鄰國主義，於彼何與！日本又謂東亞需新秩序，彼為建樹新秩序而戰；夫何謂新秩序，曰順我者生，逆我者亡，以鐵鞭奴役異族至於永遠不得翻身；建樹新秩序卽建樹主僕關係之謂，豈有他義。日本又謂以國運作孤注矣，故爲置中國主權於彼統制之下而戰；（五月二十四日日本外務省發言人語）此其措辭立義之邏輯，無以異於曰我拚命冒險，故操刀殺人。凡此云云者，支離滅裂，萬無一是；宜乎戰爭經年而彼國會中人猶質問其當局曰：日本何爲而戰耶？</p>
<p>惟中國抗戰之本質，極為明顯；故欲中國之不復戰，祇須還中國以主權土地行政之完整。惟日本之師出無名，故惟有以戰爭解决戰爭；申言之，非任彼勝至不必再戰，卽使彼敗至不能再戰而已。若於戰爭之外，別求解決戰爭之道，世人殆久已不作是想；乃日前倫敦電傳，英國巴許爵士發表宏論，其要旨有云：</p>
<p>「日本國內對於該國政府現行政策，見解不一，工商業人士，均不贊成對華作戰，並以爲和平乃爲貿易最佳之途徑。「今茲遠東局勢之造成，實爲世界經濟政策之直接結果。蓋各國皆厲行關稅保護政策，日本全國人口一萬萬人，每年增加一百萬，本國資源極爲有限，雖全境均已闢爲耕地，但實際上仍爲貧窮之國，該國商界及軍人以外之一般人，均曾語余，準備解決中國問題，願與中國友好相處，但如何以達到此項目標，而又不致喪失顏面，則非彼等所知，要而言之，日本務當退出中國，但此層倘欲辦到，應在世界上爲日本籌畫前途，俾克銷售其貨物，從而給養其人口，俾克維持其合理的健康。至以軍事方面而論，日本金融窘迫，不能聽任現行局勢長此下去，由此觀之，日本將在短時期之內，採取合理的態度明矣。」</p>
<p>巴許爵士者，英國之名經濟學者，赴日游歷，纔歸英倫，日前應國際問題某集會之　而演講如右。來電傳述，宜不及所講之十一精義殆不外此，其間論因證果，灼見眞知，自爲各國注意日本戰時内情者所樂聞；雖右舉片段之中，亦頗有不成因果之數點，是必電傳簡略，當非名學者而矛盾也。我人逖聽之餘，所不能已於言者：巴許爵士稱日本爲貧窮之國，復以遠東現狀爲世界各國現行經濟政策之後果，似日本發動侵華之原因在此；又謂世界應爲日本籌謀經濟之出路，似乎結束日本侵華之方法在此。誠如巴許爵士之說，則日人與非日人所懷『日本何爲而戰』之疑問，答案在於斯矣。雖然，其然乎？</p>
<p>巴許爵士，經濟名學者也；仁者見仁，智者見智，故經濟學者對於一切現象之見解在經濟。抑我人不以巴許爵士之見解爲偏見。原人類文　進化之跡象，閱數千百年而至現代；縱而爲國際問題，橫而爲社會問題；爲謀問題之解決而委之於宗教或一般文化，或求之於科學，甚至訴之於戰爭；舉以歸諸經濟，是亦我人所願垣白是認。篷巴許爵士之說，根本不謬，所惜乎日本並不如此：退一步言之，日本在事實上無逃乎此法則，所惜乎日人不自覺其如此。蓋當世之國際爭競，無論政治措施；軍事規畫與行動；各以經濟爲觀點，則政治與軍事皆工具也。日本則不然，方懵然醉心於貫徹其軍事之理想，完成其政治之願望，彼視經濟爲工具而己，故於侵華之初期乃至今茲，彼當局之種種說明與種種表示，未嘗提示其欲求乃在經濟，更自根本批判其武力侵略行爲，且違反經濟之鐵則。我人在此短文之中，固不遑詳爲論證，然至少以中國歷來在遼吉黑諸省，所予日本以發展經濟，救彼貧窮之機會，彼未嘗致全力於運用，可以反證日本之意識與欲念之不在經濟：亦卽九一八後之侵華事實，數年來之遠東禍患，原因皆不在經濟。</p>
<p>遠東事，曲在日本，責任在日本，而日本之意識與欲念，却不在乎經濟：則巴許爵士所建議，爲日本經濟而籌謀，不足以促日本之幡然改圖，有可斷言也。是以今日之事，在中國以抗戰爲不二法門，在各友邦亦必體認以戰爭解决戰爭之外，不必存何希望，若希望解决於戰爭之外，必待日本大徹大悟，放棄其政治願望與軍事理想！否則，予彼經濟生路，徒以加强其政治之野心，加强其軍事之擴展而已。</p>

<h3>平地游擊戰爭論</h3>
<p>— 周士梯</p>
<p>子，平地地形平坦，道路繁多，×人的襲擊比山地較易，因此要經常研究×情，判斷×情，及時了解×人之行動及企圖，</p>
<p>丑，提高警覺性，注意保守我軍之一切秘密，部隊一切動作要迅速，要輕便，以便隨時能行動和戰爭。</p>
<p>寅，加强偵察警戒（偵察警戒已詳上述），要特別注意夜間及拂曉前的偵察警戒，在×人周圍，都要派出偵察，使×人一舉一動，能及時知道，加强各方面的通訊聯絡，使情况能迅速傳達。</p>
<p>卯，防×襲擊的最好方法，是積極活動，尤其是經常以小部隊去襲擊擾亂×人。這樣不但使×人處於被動地位，窮於應付我們，且能造成×人的困難，恐慌，弱點，過失，以利我們去消滅×人。</p>
<p>辰，預先知道×向我襲擊時的處置（這是依靠於偵察工作），</p>
<p>A，雖我兵力較×優勢，亦可離開×襲擊之自的地。以一小部在正面箝制×人，破壞混亂其部署，主力轉移到×側方，或後方，突擊之，或在中途施行伏擊。</p>
<p>B，全部撤退，據×佔其所要襲擊的目的地，以少數便衣偵察員，在×附近秘密地不斷地進行偵察，主力×撤退時必經之道路伏擊之，但要注意秘密企圖，最好我軍完全都向假方向撤退，然後轉進伏擊地點，或以輕重行李向另一方向撤退，戰鬥部隊繞道秘密均到伏擊地點、以惑×人、欺騙×人、此種行動、對×情要有正碓判斷、如十一月三日五台×襲擊洪口鎭時、我們佔計×撤囘五台的可能性較大、但日間必休息、可能於夜間行動、如三日夜間不撤退、四日拂曉的撤退、故决定到滑石口附近伏擊（此處地形較好）結果五日晚九時許、我軍剛在滑石口、正進行偵察地形、配備突擊之際、×措手不及、我大獲全勝、</p>
<p>C，如×佔優勢，我應躱避×之襲擊，迅速轉移，但仍須進行游擊戰而迷惑×人，擾亂×人，使×不易找到我們轉移的方向，而繼續進擊，同時要有便衣偵察，秘密在×人附近，不斷進行偵察，及時明瞭×之行勸</p>
<p>已，未預先知道×向我襲擊、×已接近我勢戒部隊時的處置：（這種情形在沒有偵察　才有）</p>
<p>子，警戒部隊須盡力頭强抵抗，縱受多少損失亦所不惜，此爭取主力完成戰鬥準備，或其他處置的餘裕時間，使×不能接近主力，</p>
<p>丑，如×人佔優勢，主力須迅速向有利方面撤退，以一部有組織的掩護，切忌混亂，防×人繼續追擊，此時，如附近有×軍時，則支鄰部隊應派出所部到×側面或後面去擾擊×人，使被×襲擊之我軍部隊，能安全轉移。</p>
<p>寅，如我兵力佔優勢，×又係深入我地區，在有利條件下，則亦可以一部在正面控制×人，主力相抗從側面或後面去突擊×人，或秘密推移到×撤退時必經道路側面，待其撤退時擊滅之，</p>
<p>卯，突然遭×襲擊時的處置：（這個情况，只有在不注意偵察警戒時才有）</p>
<p>（一），突然遭×襲擊，我是處於不利之地位，應迅速動作，脫離×人，或利用時機，加以反擊卽擊潰之，如已被×數重包圍，應有計劃地迅速撤退退</p>
<p>（二）如主力巳衝出，但有一部被×包圍而不能衝出時，則已衝出之部隊，應按情况，儘可能去援救附近的友隣，則友隣須盡全力去助，此時可估計到×在戰鬥時，部隊建立往往混亂，和因勝利而驕傲，戒備必　，有利於我突然施行反擊、及取得勝利，因此，可按照當時情况，迅速定下决心。</p>
<p>（三）被×包圍時，切忌各自逃命，無次序的亂逃。要知道在任何的危險下，堅决，勇敢，沈着，有計劃有組織爾擊薄弱點的向×，是可以脫離危險的如採取防禦，則危險尙逐漸增加，有終至於被×消滅的危險（只有估計我軍能迅速增援，且確實無法衝出時才能堅守，這是例外），去年八月三日我××游擊隊二個連在二重子溝。拂曉時×秘密接近，將其軍士哨消滅後，繼續向主力包圍攻擊，該游擊隊不知集中主力向×衝擊，以求脫險，而堅守村落，英勇頑强抵抗，結果全部殉難。</p>
<p>（辛）怎樣對付×人的圍攻？</p>
<p>甲，×估領區内的游擊根據地，和在×側方後方活動的游擊隊，是×人的眼中釘，×人對這些根據地，常常採取團攻的方式，×人圍攻平地較山地爲便利，因此，在平地活動的散隊，應經常注意到×人的圍攻。</p>
<p>乙，抗戰以來，×人對華北游擊根據地，曾實行無數次的園攻，如去年二三月間三路大舉圍攻晉西北，四月間大舉圍攻晉東南，數次圍攻晋察冀邊區，尤其是去年九十十一月間，五萬大兵分五部圍攻；一月間的四路圍攻下，懷寧左，右等的×支隊地區；八月至十一月三次（每次都是三路至五路）國攻我×支隊×團廠汗營地區，九月間五路圍攻漠汗山×支隊。，十月間三路圍攻綏遠以南之廟兒溝大楡樹之□支隊，十一月間五路圍攻歸綏東北于溝口子，紅召地區之□支隊，這些圍攻×人費了很大的氣力，都被我紛碎了，擊潰了，使其遭受重大的損失。保持這些地區到現在仍然在我手裏，這說明我們是有方法和力量粉碎×人圍攻的，並且相信此後遝可以繼續粉碎×人的圍攻。</p>
<p>丙，我們所得的經騐敎訓，多數是在×對山地的圍攻，可是山地與平地的地形條件不同，便影響到對付×人圍攻的戰術，比如去年三月間我們最後粉碎×對晉西北之圍攻，以□□旅□□旅主力，在寗武陽方口之間兩側待機五六天，企區迫退寗武之×，待其退却而夾擊同時並可夾擊朔縣增援之×。結果激戰三次，我們是成功了。但如是平地，則不可能。又如十月間渾源，大營，廣靈×二千餘，分三路圍攻大人莊地區，我□□游擊部隊數百人，就利用大人莊山地橫六七十里，直四五十里的地區，與×打圈子，打了三天，×傷亡百餘，我無損失；但如在平地，則亦不可能，所以平地對付×人圍攻，與山地多少不同的。現提出平地對付×人之圍攻的幾個問題如下：</p>
<p>【一】×人交通工具多，平地可以充分使用【如牛車路便勉强可駛汽車】，×人的調動集中較迅速。因此我們有很周密的確實的偵察，及時明瞭×人圍攻的企圖，而有所準備。</p>
<p>【二】游擊隊游擊小組經常積極在×人附近活動，可以及時了解×人行動及企圖，和有時亦可打破×人圍攻部署或計劃。</p>

<h3>維持國際收支平衡　財部實施進口管理　預計年節外匯兩萬萬元以上　獎勵出口結匯發給匯價差額</h3>
<p>【中央社重慶二日電】財政部機言人頃就公布「非常時期禁止進口物品辦法」之意義。發表談話于下：維持國際收支平衡，為任何國家經濟政策中之要義，而在作戰期間貿易易趨逆勢，尤應由政認採用種種方法，維持平衡，俾不致影響國民經濟，妨碍戰事進行。我國人超素鉅，而戰時所需城防用品，及工業交通器材仍多，且賴輸入。設不挽囘國際收支之逆勢，必不免影響外購市塲，妨碍經濟。</p>
<p>本将有利于此，對于廿六年九日擬定「促進生產調整貿易辦法」大綱，設立農業工鑛貿易三調整委員會、並另撥、金開辨兵險，實為戰時經濟要策。同時並擬具禁止現額特許之管理進口方案，呈請核定，以種種原因。管理進口方案，未匪核准實施。嗣於上年三月，實行管理外貿時，復經提出管理進口方案，擇定若干種類奢侈品，及半侈侈品，擬予分別禁限入口，其爲抗戰建設及日用切論之品，則准由政府銀行，照法價售給外匯，後因外界滋生疑慮，未能付諸實行。</p>
<p>此年餘以來，×偽利用我之稅欵，及掠奪我之物質所得之鉏額法幣；大險套澳外匯，致引起外匯市場上敎年來未有之激烈。自平衡基金成立。英方銀行加入平衡工作，原為英主援助之盛意，亦廳便利國際貿易之道。乃平衡工作，受意外之威脅，旣感困難；而在抗戰期間，國民本應勵行節約，減少不必要之消費，並應增強購買，必需品之力量，以符「軍事第一，勝利第一」之旨。經縝密商討，僉以禁止一部份物品進口，爲戰時必要之措施，亦必爲中外人士所共諒。即凡非抗戰建國及人生日用所切需，或有部份需要，而可覓本國產品代用，或多由×國產製。輸入時容易冒牌侵銷的一切物品，均應禁止輸入。</p>
<p>特卽依照照上列標準，選定禁運物品，擬定禁運辦法。舉如洋酒，洋烟，海產，絲貨，化妝品，裝飾品，玩具，樂器，一部分糖品，葷食，頭，菓實，蔬菜，以及帶有奢侈品之毛貨，棉貨，木材，紙張，竹木籐器，土石器品，以及可覓代用品之液體燃料等類，都凡二百三十四稅則號列，均在應禁之列。業經本部電令總稅務司，分電各關，自令到日起，一律禁止進口。</p>
<p>綜計上電物品，禁止進口以後，照二十年進口額推算，約可省出二萬三千餘萬元，約合美金六千八百萬元，英金一千三百萬磅。此項鉅額外匯支出，卽可移用於購買抗戰建國必需之物料，是在我國不過變更外匯用途，在各國不過轉換其輸入物品，實質上其對華貿易之統計，仍不至大減，當可獲得各友邦之充分諒解也。</p>
<p>禁止進口物品辦法</p>
<p>（一）依照附表所載，海關造口物品十八組，二百三十四稅則號列、由財政部令飭總稅務司轉飭令關，一體禁止進口。</p>
<p>（二）上列禁止進口物品，于禁令頒布後同時不許報運轉口。</p>
<p>（三）禁止進口物品，如因調劑後方市價，供給特種用途，或有其他正當原因，經政府機關核請者，得由財政部査酌國際需要，核發購運特許證，其給證辦法另訂之。</p>
<p>（四）禁止進口物品，凡用帕包由外洋寄遞進口，或由本國口岸寄遞轉口、亦適用本辦法之規定，至禁止進口物品之名稱及號列詳表，另于報端公布。</p>
<p>領取滙價差額意義</p>
<p>財政部發言人頃對公布「出口貨物結瞧領取匯價差額辦法」之意義，發表談話如下。關於禁止非必需進口物品之意義及辦法，旣已另行發表聲明，同時促進出口貿易問題，本部向極認爲重要。自抗戰開始，卽擬定促進生產講整貿易辦法大綱，組織調整貿易機構，頒布各項調整辦法。上年六月，復頒行維護生產，促進外銷辦法，除用豁免捐稅，代保兵稅，便利運輸，融通資金等方法，協助商人經營出口貿易外，復由政府貿易機，遠景收購，以期增進輸出，振發生產。惟近來因交通困難，國產輸出運繳增多，出口數量因而減少，商民在此種情形之下，成本加重資方不充，對于經營外輸，不免動懷疑畏；而向在國內經營出口之外國商行，又以非通常貿易狀况或至裏足，凡此均足妨碍輸出，非本部維護國民經濟之本旨。發以最近外匯市場擊動，爲援助平衡工作，以减輕其困難起見。爰由本部擬定「出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法」，除與貿買價債及儲料有關桐油茶果緒定鑛產四類外，其餘出口貨物，互須依照法價，售結外匯，售予中國或交通銀行，同由中國或交通銀行，給予相當之法價及銀行按照價格之差額。如此辦理，則大多數出口貨物，均可自由運銷。所爲鉅額匯差，除支付繳費後，尙可獲得其餘。是商民所有困難，政府悉爲解除；政府所署外匯，仍得大量集中於維持法幣，安定金融之中。復能促進外銷，增加生產，對于國計民生，泃屬兼籌並顧。</p>
<p>領取匯價差額辦法</p>
<p>（一）所有出口貨物，應結外匯，除桐油，茶葉，猪宗，礦產四類，因與易買價當及儲料有關，應由政府貿易機關，體察產銷情形，及國際市價，臨時以優惠價格；統籌收購運銷外，其餘貨物，無論由政府貿易機遇運銷，或由商號自行貿易，槪須依照生價，將所得外匯，售予中國或交通銀行，其售價應與之法幣，由中國或交通銀行取得結匯人同意，于指定之增進，以法幣支付之。</p>
<p>（二）前項依照法價結匯之出口貨物，于實際結淸匯額後，得匯結算證作，向結匯銀口領取法價。與該行售膊價格之額，結匯銀行得向結匯人收取銀行向例應得之手續費，但不得超過百分之三。</p>
<p>（三）前項匯法額原結匯銀行取得結匯人之同意，于核定之内地地點以法幣支付之。</p>

<h3>汕頭市的淪陷　（四）</h3>
<p>— 林高</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>夜色慢慢地增濃，×機，×艇，×砲，都停息了，怠倦代替了恐怖爬上人們的身心。</p>
<p>「呀喲！汕頭起火了！」</p>
<p>市區的北面中心處，一縷白烟昇浮着，白烟下面是毁紅的火燄，接着，第二處，第三處，都連在一起了。半個天空染成了紅色、火星像「放星火」一樣的噴起，隱的地可以聽見輕微的爆炸聲。</p>
<p>×艦上的探照燈開了，一道强烈的燈光像毒蛇叶出的長舌一樣，貪婪地亂嚙着岸邊的房屋堆棧，和碼頭，汕頭，在要落人魔掌的握下，變成焦土，×人眼巴巴地看這一片美好的圓地失去這時的心里是多麽建過和焦急啊！探照燈的光儘在一座座高聳的摟層中間轉來穿去。</p>
<p>廿二日，天空略微有些發白，一條×艇泊靠海在旁避風塘堤；兩匹深綠色的野×挾着一面刺日的血滴濺散一樣的旗幟，登上避風塘堤，用竹竿把旗豎在塘内的木船上。立刻又溜逃卜艇，停了一下，四面還是平靜的，才又爬上塘場，猢猻一樣地舞着旗語。</p>
<p>接着另一條×艇，靠泊前招商局碼頭，×軍十人分成三組，浮脚輕步，略微着身。慢慢地從招商局棧正而步到棧旁轉灣入北面直通招商路的小巷，突地像觸到了電一樣，都退縮了倚傍着牆邊，隔了很久，才又一步步地繼續行進。</p>
<p>元亨碼頭，招商碼頭和海關前都有成隊的×軍豋陸了，遠處有一陣疏落的槍聲，這後便很靜寂。潮海關的旗桿上，也飄着血滴濺散的×旗，沿岸的碼頭，外人堆棧後的高屋，好多處有×旗掛起，囘過頭來，角石山上，也遍播着强盜的標幟。</p>
<p>美麗的汕頭市，便這樣地淪入×手，讓×人踐踏，蹂躪了。</p>
<p>海關面前泊着一條大五肚船，滿裝豆餅，想是在×艦人港時來不及栘開的，×軍去招來了很多浪人，他握着旗站立在旁邊，讓他們去搬擔，全船近二千個豆餅，價値六七千元，不上十分鐘，全都刦光，廣生輪上，同胞和外僑一百多人，都共同親目看見這一件×軍指揮浪人搶刦的事實。</p>
<p>十一時左近，一位朋友和他的家人從一條外僑用的汽艇上船，他說廿一晚上，沒有×機的時候，他想逃出汕市。以免淪在×手，但是街上有軍隊佈防，不得通過所以逃在外僑家里今早市上交通要點，站着×軍，搜査行人把各人身上的財物都刼去，而且指揮浪人搶刦財物，他們是向外僑借了汽艇直接從崎碌海旁駛開，所以才能安然到船。</p>
<p>潮海關的鐘面指着是正午十二時，廣生輪啓行了，懷着一個憂懼和憤怒交什着的心，從幾十條×艦旁邊經過時，×艦正在搬運馬匹和軍械下艇，船間行一小時後，海面才望不見×船，也沒有和平時一樣地散佈着溪船的風帆，只是寂寞的一片，遭受搜査的事是沒有了。滿懷是憤怒，羞恥和懷念。</p>
<p>四點多鐘，船過惠來縣界，望着那褐萱相間的山峯，我知道，×人必定還沒有達則那里，朋友們，這時一定的是在那處的山峯脚下，佈置着作游擊戰。汕頭市是在×人海軍射程内，全無險阻可守，淪陷是早在估計中，物資衰弱相孺婦。大都已疏散。×人可以佔領汕頭市却絕對確决的不能全部佔領朝屬各縣，峯巒起伏的地方、×軍的武裝都失去効用，那里便是×軍的墳墓，×人兵源資源都感竭乏，佔領了汕頭市，不單他不能得到了什麽，反而加速的覆工！</p>
<p>廿三日的上午七時，廣生輪抵香港，經過若干的週折，全船的義民在正午才全部得到上岸，香港上空響着的飛機巳不是散佈殺人種子的强盜，但是歌舞昇平的也大部是我們的同胞。（完）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>××××英國</h3>
<p>天津事件，東京談判，但澤問題，從遠東到歐北，侵略者的租金、都向××××進遏了！</p>
<p>天津事件，關係着英國整個遠東勢力的去留問題，將於本月六日舉行的東京談判，英國當然不會感受日本涉及東亞「新秩序」的任何談題、更不能攀東京爲慕尼黑、祗能企圖在所謂地方性局部件問題尋覓妥協、不過一種妥協、亦徒然更增日×的勢燄、未來禍患，更將嚴重。</p>
<p>但澤問題，希特勒旣志在必得，莫索里尼現在也出而敲詐了，這一方面是歐洲侵略者的「乘危肆刦」，另一方面也在支持日×在東的擊詐與搶刦，英國暨但澤問題，已有哈外相的口開的「抵抗」，但是英法本身保障波蘭的力量，旣未獲蘇聯助力而大可懷疑，則這種「强硬」的結果，幷不會比他在遠東的「退讓」的結果稍爲好些</p>
<p>夾攻下的英國，向那裏去呢？</p>
<p>生路，是坦坦蕩蕩地有在，英國人民里已看淸楚，英政府也未嘗沒有意見，那就是建立反侵略關紅的路，在遠東，更積極地支持具有其同利害關係而抵抗戰略者已有兩年的中國，在歐洲，趕快放棄已成縮影的「轉變希特勒進路」的「如意算盤」，加緊完成英蘇締結互助協定。</p>
<p>今日報載英國外交將有新活動，並召駐外使節開會，我們企圖是走上生路去的表現！</p>

<h3>德皇的錯誤　一失策千古恨</h3>
<p>亞道夫希特勒先生，久違了，近來，你似乎有點　的，想上去，你終得攪點什麼花樣來，好也，反正，英國有的是海軍，法國有的是空軍，蘇聯有的是陸軍，美國有的是金元；還有，我們中國，有的是四萬萬五千萬血和肉的長城，你要玩起什麽來，我們總得奉陪一下。</p>
<p>不過，我們是禮義之邦，總得跟你先禮後兵，讓我們提醒你：你還記得一九一八年失敗的恥辱嗎？雖然，你把這失敗記在猶太人帳上——不管你是說，英　猶太軍官太多，還是德國猶太軍官太少—；魯登道夫將軍，把這失敗，推在德國人民太不够堅忍——自然，人家餓肚皮，原與他無干——；你的後台大老板洛桑先生，則把這次失敗歸在德國錢不够——當然啰，他自己口袋裏的馬克·是另一囘事——。但是我們看見的，還有一個失敗的原因：那是你們大皇帝，威廉二世自己犯的錯誤，一失策乃有這樣的千古恨，且讓我跟你說，信不信由你。</p>
<p>朋友，你且去翻開你們的國內歷史課本。遠在一九〇四年，比利時王李奧浦二世，到柏林來報聘；你們的威廉皇便請他檢閱軍隊。</p>
<p>『對于這些，我眞沒有興趣；我想，還是有錢萬事足。』在閱兵的時候，比王說。李奧浦二世，那時可眞是世界上數一數二的有錢人，比法國大四倍，比比利時本身大八十四倍的剛果自由邦，就是他個人的私產，自那裏，每年可以得到三·三〇〇，〇〇〇，法郞的收入。</p>
<p>就這一點，可害了你們的威廉王，在李奧浦聘問吿畢，行將吿辭的前一個晚上，威廉二世吿訴他：在最近的將來，德法戰爭，將不可避免，屆時，若果比利時能不守中立，而跟德國幹，德國願意把盧森堡和林堡兩個地方，送給李奧浦珍玩。</p>
<p>有錢萬事足！李奧浦二世囘到不魯塞爾之後，居然也練起兵來，準備去接收盧森堡和林堡。</p>
<p>不幸，天不假年，在一九〇九年十二月十七日·李奧浦二世一命嗚呼了；他那時已練成了四二，八〇〇名兵士，但是，終不能見得兩塊肥美的土地。</p>
<p>一九一四年八月二日晚間七時，一通德國的哀的美敦送到了比利時，要求准許德國軍隊自由通過比境前往法國，這在威廉二世想來，現在的比王亞爾培氏，是李奧浦二世的侄兒，誕生在德境的沙遜柯堡；王后伊利莎白，是德國本伐尼亞省人；有　樣的鄕親黨誼，讓一條路，總是沒有問題的。所以，他又以個人的名義，打了個電報給亞爾培王，要求互相合作。</p>
<p>這個電報，是在八月四日淸晨到達盧文宮中的。威廉二世眞沒料到，亞爾培王會大發雷霆，認爲這封電報對他，是一種莫大的侮辱。立刻，下令他的四二，八〇〇軍隊，出動到邊境，把所有的公路和橋梁全自動炸燬了。</p>
<p>伊莉莎白王后，是道地的德國人，她就把威廉二世的電報，和德國的哀的美敦，看了又看，讀了又讀，不漏下一個字。然後，在那張電報紙的反面，用流俐的德語，寫下了復電：不能敬遵台命。同樣地，一封電報，已經先打到巴黎去了。五個鐘頭之後，德國的大軍四師，已開始衝入了比國彊界。</p>
<p>但是，比利時終究已經有了軍隊，有了準備，在極堅苦的情形之下，支持了兩星期，讓法國作了一切必要的措置。威廉二世，三天打到巴黎的迷夢，終究不曾成功，征服世界的迷夢，更成了泡影！</p>
<p>希特勒先生，這該是你的前車之鑒吧！</p>
<p>好吧，亞道夫希特勒先生，我們坦能堡再見吧！因爲，恐怕那就是你的墳墓所在地！</p>

<p>這個自命爲幽默大王的蕭老頭子伯納，當他還不曾發跡的時候，是在倫敦一家小報舘裏，寫寫劇評，混口飯吃吃。</p>
<p>蕭老頭兒的確相當地會吹毛求疵，因此許多當時的伶人，都跟他有點不對勁。</p>
<p>一次在一家酒店裏，又因批評，跟一位名伶鬧開了。那位名伶是演英雄的好手，馬上展開台上的姿勢，把一張卡片向老蕭一丢，昂首掉臂走了。</p>
<p>這意思，是叫老蕭，訂個個子，决鬥，蕭老頭兒，那時雖還不老，但瘦的也可以，自　之下，一身骨頭，那是那位大英雄的對手？但是，他也只好把卡片收下。</p>
<p>到了晚上，他把片子上，加上一行宇，「請准持片者人場。」於是，他看了一場白戲，看完了，他跑刊後台，　着那位名伶；「謝謝你的卡片，我看了一場白戲，明天一定給你寫一篇好評。」</p>

<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>這仍然是一個資本主義的世界，自然有錢就得萬能。上海的新聞同業，竟一家家跌到錢孔里去了。那　所謂前進的黄髮藍眼的『中國之友』，仍然脫不了錢的誘惑。香港呢？有沒有爲幾塊錢，出賣了良知和靈魂？</p>
<p>歐州又好像很緊張，但七月一日，是平安過去了，我們很奇怪，老希算過了這一個週末。但是，你想他是傻子嗎？眞會跟誰拚！那才怪。</p>
<p>不過，話又得說囘來，香港也辦起防毒面具來了。不知是準備防那一方來的毒？東方？還是哪一方？可是，香港須要防的事，還多着呢！</p>
<h3>麟西爪　最靈驗的咒</h3>
<p>一八四九年匈牙利發生革命、以推翻哈斯堡皇族爲目標，結果革命失敗，叛黨領袖均被政府殺死，當時匈牙利首相巴底安尼，亦無辜被殺。</p>
<p>首相的母親聽到愛子枉死的消息時，悲憤塡胸，不禁破口咒罵皇帝。她說，「但願他和他的族人代代不得好死！」這句話居然非常靈驗，在歷史上被稱爲「哈斯堡皇族的咒詛。」</p>
<p>匈牙利皇帝受人這樣咒詛之後，兒子自殺，老婆被人暗殺，一弟被處死刑，另一弟被人仇殺，一弟婦被火燒死，另一弟婦發瘋，他的姪女死於火中，他的姪兒遇着意外而身亡，另一姪兒溺死，還有一姪兒在沙拉哲伏，被刺身死，激起第一次世界大戰，皇帝自已也在世界大戰期間死亡，帝國崩潰。</p>

<h3>海上風雲22</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，趁德輪『凱柏隆齊號』去遊歷歐洲，因爲英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。好容易地逃出虎口，囘到美境白海。傑克與比爾便囘紐約去，見到邱克斯先生。邱又叫他們趁「聖瑪克號」去歐洲找他的兒子。在艦上，傑克不肯替一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報……</p>
<p>在晚飯的時候，「聖瑪克號」上原來的無線電收發員馬倫來了，傑克下班；這天晚上，他閑空着，他就看一本新出版的無線電敎科書消遣。</p>
<p>但是，一天的勞苦，累得他很疲倦，他倒在一張放在上面甲板的汽筒後面的　子里，立刻就睡着了。雖然，在這個季候，天氣却很凉冷風吹着，頭等艙僅有的幾個客人，都在吸烟室裏，或者客廳裏面。</p>
<p>傑克睡着了多久，他自己也不知道，但是，他醒來，是因爲汽筒的另一面，有人在說話，將他擾醒了。其中有一個聲音，鑽進了他的耳朶，他記得起，那是馬了强生，</p>
<p>「若不是爲了無線電室的那個小畜生，」强生在說，『這消息，現在早到了馮司豋的手裏了。』</p>
<p>「所以你就沒法子將英國巡洋艦的消息通知他了嗎？」另外一個人問。</p>
<p>「不。我　要幹。我要去看看，晚上那個收發員怎搽，他或者不致於這樣多疑，悖理，除非白天那個小傢伙已經和他說過啦。」</p>
<p>「你是說，敎授，你以前認識他嗎？」那個人問。</p>
<p>「是的，在「凱隆伯齊晚」。我是——　——我是想去主持分配救生艇，因爲英國巡洋艦在後面追，滿船的人，都驚慌極啦，那時候，這個小痞棍竟然野獸般打我。」</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不將他報吿船長」</p>
<p>「可是，你想那——那——那樣做起來，似乎也不大好。」</p>
<p>有你的，拉維基敎授——現在我知道你是誰啦，强生先生，』傑克肚裏想着，「怪不得，我想，我是認得你的，儘管你喬裝改扮吧」</p>
<p>「你現在怎樣打算呢？」强生先生，（或老竟說是拉維基敎授）的仝伴在問。</p>
<p>「我要看起來，史和志，你懂無線電嗎？」</p>
<p>「還行，怎麽，你有什麽計劃——？」</p>
<p>「現在先別管，有點冷啦。我們囘艙里去，明天我要和你談很多事。」</p>

<h3>烈日下之網球劇戰　大徐勝王文正　男女混合戰充滿笑料　雙打賽王以足傷缺場</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）昨天午後、看完棒球、由加山到中華游樂會、見會前草地、已佈置一個戰場、</p>
<p>鐘鳴三響、一般爲善最樂的嘉賓、聯袂蒞止、影星黎灼灼亦在其中、她旣看完棒球，又到看網球、足見她對於體育、至感興趣、</p>
<p>此時太陽似火、炙肌作痛、義賽辦事人、以天氣太熱、乃改遲三十分鐘方開賽、</p>
<p>在三四百看客的視綫下、王文正對徐煒培的劇戰展開、第一　兩人相持甚烈、互戰廿八局、費一小時許、始判勝負、王氏以八比六先施下馬威、比數如下、</p>
<p>王一六一四五三三二四四〇四五四…八</p>
<p>徐四四四一三五五四二一四二三〇…六</p>
<p>此盤因戰成「可當局」、互見消長、情形異常緊張、亦多精彩、王氏以大刀闊斧的手叚、頻作左右底線長撇、而其優點亦在是、便派工夫、的是兇狠、不過、王氏雖勝此盤、實已不勝其苦、有力盡出、元氣大傷、故不能支持下去、何况在烈日之下對壘、先作過度的劇爭、殊屬不宜、所以王氏最後卒敗北、</p>
<p>徐氏演出、擊法可軟可硬、所取勝點、亦常以短斬見效、上綱攔擊尤具把握、王氏則輸此一着、祇緊守底線、故徐氏不上網則已、上綱必得手、而此盤王氏擊出越界球亦較多、在此種情勢下、他卒致先勝的原因、乃全在力取之功、使徐氏不易抵擋其底線撇擊、但以力取勝、較不如以智制人、王氏在此盤旣用力過度、卒感後勁不繼、故第二盤遂一蹶不振、應付術窮、徐氏取勝殊易、比數如下、</p>
<p>徐四四五一四四四…六</p>
<p>王一二三四一一〇…一</p>
<p>此盤形成單方面的表演、祗見徐氏活躍、斬擊如意、水到成渠、反看王氏則已露倦容、每吃徐氏的短擊、雖欲追遂、已感力與心違、致有一比六的大敗、</p>
<p>旣完了兩盤、二人略事休息、換去　衣、然後冉行决戰、但王氏的硬派工夫、卒不及徐氏智機白出、故在第三盤競賽中、王氏雖曾一度以三比一領先、惟徐氏沉着應戰、旣扳成平局後、形勢卽好轉、卒獲最後勝利、第三比數如下、</p>
<p>徐六一五二四四六囘五…六</p>
<p>王四四七四二〇四〇三…三</p>
<p>戰後一般的批評、謂天氣酷熱、適足影饗兩人之神經與動作、故禾能以一時成敗論英雄、此說我亦云然、至論球藝方面、徐氏則多花榜、每乘機會、施展其各種所長、如上網、短斬、及中腰　擊、反手割球等、俱是他的拿手好戲、所以能運用多方面的技術以制勝、</p>
<p>王氏唯一特長是平反手擊球、角度好、　勁力、然其用以控制徐氏的本領、捨此以外、件件輸虧、故常處於被動地位、若欲轉居主動、非盡用氣力、不易取得、惟對付徐氏、不是徒然用力可以收效的、所以、王氏用力所取得主動地位、祇在第一　、以後便居下風了、</p>
<p>第二場男女混合雙打、凌道揚未到、由老將劉福基與招　釗夫人搭配、戰刁作謙與楊渭濱女士、演出頗多噱頭、令到看官們笑口常開、不覺烈日之苦、結果劉招組以兩個六比四得勝、</p>
<p>第三場也是雙打、原由王文正與小林珍合作、出戰徐氏兄弟、但王氏因在單打時賽、十分吃苦、事後足部吊務、不能再登場、乃改由司徒壁與徐煒培搭擋、戰徐潤　、與小林珍、打來頗可觀、餘趣甚濃、結果如下、</p>
<p>徐潤培　小林珍　勝　徐煒培　司徒璧　六比四　七比五</p>
<p>阿彌陀佛、又完了一場功德、門票及抽彩券、共得欵二百九十二元、預售不在內、其中一彩、是李惠堂同事梁早如所中、得鄧祿普球拍一個（球場太歲）</p>

<p>全港公開榛球聯賽、昨日上午十時半、友碑隊與南華會初次交鋒、友卑以南華戰績平平、不于重視、豈料南華雄威大發、在第一局防守時、力制友卑、故友卑僅得蘇沙奪取一分而局終、輪至南華反攻時、德治、李安納、北士三人、連相錯誤、被吳振邦、鄭康勇、陳雨鈿、何憲成、跑囘本壘、共得四分、黄耀宗之三壘打、勞績最偉、次三兩局、友卑鬱鬱不得志、第四局不景氣未除、所獲僅一分、輪至南華反攻擊之際、友卑改擊陣勢、夏高理任中堅、李安納充投手、南華不以爲意、仍然埋頭苦幹、湯榮光一擊、而安抵一壘、希望甚濃、不幸繼之出場之吳振邦、不猛擊而施以短打、自投陷阱卒被夏高理擲球與李安納封殺、觀衆皆謂吳氏自作無謂之犧牲、旋鄭康勇擊出飛球、北士漏接、因而登一壘、但此時湯榮光已偷囘本壘得一分、陳宇鈿眼看對方　亂、試偷二壘、竟被對方投手及三壘手封殺出局、最後何憲成擊球不遠、被殺出局、攻勞始散、第五局、友卑由蘇沙、北士、李安納、夏高理取得四分、南華反攻中、黄耀宗高球被接、司徒壁得要打、陳振東乘奧馬之錯誤、上一壘、送司徒壁至二壘、湯榮光高球被鴨巴士妙手接獲、吳振邦安打上壘、司徒璧與振東推進三二兩壘、成「滿壘」之好現象、是時投手李安納滿天星斗、擲壞球四次、讓康勇登二壘、司徒璧步返本壘、得一分、直至陳雨鈿擊出高球、爲阿里接死後、友之圍乃解、第六局、友卑又由奧馬及蘇沙連得兩分、以九比八反收爲勝、第七局、兩無所獲、友卑遂吿捷</p>
<p>統觀全場、南華至第五局、仍以八比七獲勝、友卑隊每覺應付爲難、南華此戰、可謂豪矣、可惜南華經驗不足、能攻不能守、以致棋輸一着、捕手何憲成截擊偷壘員、投球多過野、反而造成對方進壘機會、投手鄭康勇、把棒有道、進攻中甚形活躍、可是在防守局面裏、每每不知大勢、曾失雙殺機會一次、以上種種、爲南華致敗之主因、但友卑之人材、實比南華爲優、南華能若此死拚、造成此緊張局面、是誠傑作、茲將雙方成績列後、</p>

<h3>說文壇上的「謀略」</h3>
<p>— 吐老</p>
<p>最近某書店出版了一本專講訟師本領的書。我只從報上看到了廣吿，據說　書是「集訟師謀略之大成，足爲文學作家之一助」的。</p>
<p>這看去很有些奇怪，所以，我便忍不住想了一想。</p>
<p>講到訟師，在渦去的社會裏確是　「謀略」過日子的階級。他們底謀略除了用在狀子上，卽是用文子去作構陷，誣賴的工作以外，還用在實際的計劃上。他們能買通官方，勾結流氓，假造證據，製造謠言，以及做其他更可怕的事。</p>
<p>不過那廣吿旣說是「足爲文學作家之一助」當然那書所講的是只限於文宇上的「謀峪」的。關於這一面，從前也有過專書，但大抵並不說出「謀略」的要訣。這還是中國人底老毛病，甚麽都要「秘二下纔合式。然而大體說來，那要訣總不外兩極：第一是給人起綽號，第二是遇事講「動機。」</p>
<p>綽號卽是所謂諢名。那方法時：在未曾寫出所控吿的人底罪狀以前，先給那姓名上安一個綽號，如「巨眼太歲」「大頭霸王」之類，意思是讓官方一看那姓名，便便斷定他不是個好東西。「動機」是現代的話，從前的術語叫作「居心」。那方法是：若果所控吿的人有兩件大家都知道的善事，便說他居心爲了求名或求利，總之好處也是壞處，或者比容易看出的壞處還壞。在反吿的時候，是常用着這一手的。</p>
<p>不過現在要問的是這些「謀峪」到底對於「文學作家一有甚麽用處呢？——其實據我看來，那位編書的人實在是枉費心思，我們有些文學作家却早就學會了這些「謀略」了。</p>
<p>倘是不信，倒不妨去査査文擅上的舊賬和新賬，「綽號學一已經盛行遇一個時期，「居心學」却一直盛行着，到現在還沒有衰歇。而最普遍的是自己被人批評得走頭無路的時候，就忽然變成X光，說可以看見批評者底「勸機」了。這用的便正是反吿的一手。</p>
<p>然而據經騐看來，這種訟帥底文風，實在並不能有「助」於「文學作家」的。「綽號學」雖然盛行過，但結果却又消滅得沒有了影子。那原因便是：旣然掛了「文學作家」的招牌，總要顧一點「文」的面子，不願意給對方起那種「巨眼太歲」「大頭霸王」的綽號，而且事實上對方也是文學作家，决不能壞到「太歲」「霸王」上面去，所以起的綽號也只能限於「個人主義者」「悲觀主義者」之類。但這却實在太廣泛，受的人旣未曾感到打擊，聽的人也覺得平常得很，所以寫出來就完，效力是一點也得不到的。「居心學」維持得比較長久，但到底也還底注意。因為旣是作家，主要的當然是文字，大家也只看批評者對你底文字批評得對不對，居心怎樣畢竟難以捉模，實在用不着管這樣的鳥事。而且這話還會使自己失掉了體統，讓者會疑心你和批評者的性別不同，那位曾經要求過你甚麽而沒有達到目的，纔來『報復』一下的——這叫作自己給自己上當。</p>
<p>所以，訟師底文風儘管是高妙，文學作家却實在是得不到益處的。</p>
<p>至於文字以外實際上的『謀略』，我們有些文學作家有限得很。理由很簡單：文壇畢竟不是衙門，弄來弄去，到頭總是被人拆穿完事。</p>
<p>能排絕訟師式的『謀略』，文學作家倒或者會有些希望。</p>
<h3>上海閘北的巡禮</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>位於上海外國租界的視綫以內，曾經密集百萬人口，而現在却滿播着焦木颓垣的閘北，是在前年我軍棄守上海區前數大十月二十七號陷落的。屈指一數，日方佔據該地己有十九個月，論理，大可實行它野心勃勃而盡力宣傳的改良市政和經濟開發的計劃了。</p>
<p>距今幾天前，我囘到閘北盤桓了數小時，所入眼簾的景象，比我在前年一個陰沉的冬日，最後一次到閘北所見到的，還要令人沮喪。那時候，公共租界被日軍侵佔的部份和閘北，幾乎看不出有什麼不同之處，因爲這兩區都是一片荒凉，瀰漫着死的氣息；現在呢，公共租界喧囂的熱鬧，和閘北死一般的沉寂，却變成了尖銳的對照。</p>
<p>在閘北失陷以後的十九個月裏，日方並沒有着手來改變它彈痕纍纍的面目，當時的砲彈窟洞依然點綴着瓦礫遍地的街道，被機關槍火射得像蜂窠一般的牆壁，還竪立在路旁，搖搖欲傾。華軍的堡壘還存在看，只是沙袋業已稍壞，從裏面窺過半掩店門可以直瞧到街上。</p>
<p>商務印書舘似値百萬元的工場，一堵牆向着隣近的壕溝外傾，工場四週，被有刺鐵絲網包圍着，面前的坦克車大陷穿却已塡平，以便軍用卡車偶而駛過，兩年前，商業繁榮，行人擁擠的寶山路，叫人見到便想起鬼市來。不過鬼市的邊道上沒有彈穴而已。</p>
<p>五年裏被日本侵略者兩次摧毀的北火車站，已重新迭成，但外國人的眼晴，不能窺察它的神秘，因爲現在它的四週已造起水泥高牆，通流電的鐵柵，和有刺鐵絲網的障碍物。朝着公共租界，還有一座簇新的水泥地下堡，那是預防不測之用的。出入北站只留一個門口。站著板着臉兒的日本憲兵，仔細注視着驚慌慌地乘火車的華人。</p>
<p>我囘想到前年十月裏，從界路租界方面的破屋子裏，向一百碼外北站看去，只見日機懶散地在北姑天空盤旋着，擲下巨大的炸彈，下面是戴圓錐草帽的中國士兵，也許是從廣西開到的援軍，因爲相距很近，我能看出他們每一個臉上的特點；飛機每投一彈，他們便平伏地上，一霎那間，砰的一聲，震耳欲聾，木片和塵土接着飛揚起來，這些士兵在炸彈轟發後，便立刻安詳地繼續他們的職務，好像沒事一般。　（未完）</p>
<h3>罪人的路</h3>

<p>破車斷槍折弓，也是角聲。</p>

<p>過去的運命永遠是懺悔錄，</p>

<h3>中國文學的創造方向</h3>
<p>— 孺潔</p>
<p>今日横在中國文學之創造的道路底面前的最重最基本的問題，並不是降低文學水準，適合大衆或者提高大衆對文學嗜好的水準這兩個問題，而是一個整個的中國文學之創造方向的問題。如果我們單獨地提出『降低』文學的水準而適合大衆，那問題顯然是單純化枝節化了，我們今日的文學運動之最重要的中心工作，固然是在於大量的吸收大衆，爭取大衆，但是吸收大衆和爭取大衆，並不是單祇『降低』文學的水準就可以奏效的，在吸收大衆爭取大衆的工作底前頭站立若的，正是整個的中國文學創造方向的問題，『降低』文學的水準，顯然不能算是這個工作的全部，而只是它的一環，這一環的工作雖然不能說是不重要，但是如其單以這一環而蓋過了全部，那無疑是一種錯誤。</p>
<p>和這同時，如果我們單獨地提出的高大衆的水準間題，無疑也是枝節的，我們知道提高大衆的文化水準底問題，並不單是文學上面的問題，也不是單單文學方面的工作所能達到的，它——這個『提高』的問題，是整個的社會文化運動問題是整個文化運動上的工作，雖然作爲整個的文化運動之一環的文學遝動，在這個工作上也應該盡力，但是這提高大衆水準的工作之並不是它自身之獨特的任務，却是十分顯然的。文學雖然在其本質上賦有着一般文化運動之共通的特點，但是這些特點之體現到文學上來，是定要通過它自身之特殊的本質的，提高大衆水準這一工作也是這樣，它之體現在文學上面，首先就要通過文學的特點，這就是說，首先就要成爲文學創造方向之有機的一面，才能够通渦文學的特點而獲得具體化，因比如果不從整個中國文學之創迭方向的理解上來提起這個問題，無疑也是一種錯誤。</p>
<p>今日我們中國文學之爭取大衆吸收大衆的工作，其問題不是在於『降低水準』或是『提高水準』，而是在於整個的中國文學之新的創造，我們需要一些新的文學風格，一些新的文學典型，一些新的文學技術，總之，我們今日需要一個新的完整的文學體系，需要一個新的具體的文學方法，這個新的體系與辦法，並不是單單在於通俗化大衆化，它還包含有極廣泛的許多方面，比如中國化現實化，比如文學傳統的吸收與歷史習慣的提鍊等等，都是它所包含着的東西，這種種複雜廣袤制方面之匯流，就成爲今日的中國文學底新的創造方向之總體，而這一個新的創造方向，由於其所包含的廣泛，由於其所賦有的內容之豐　優越，是足以有着最大的力量去吸收廣大的羣衆，爭取廣大的羣衆，因爲這種創作方向是需要從中國歷史底全部的特點的批判攝取，以及從大衆生活之全部本質底積極凝鍊而成的，所以它能够最澈底的適應大衆，滲入大衆，爲大衆所愛好，所理解，從而完成其爭取大衆吸收大衆的目的。</p>
<p>我們今日之在文學上要求新的創造方向，不僅是爲今日，同時也是爲將來，不僅要在今日發揮文學的戰鬥力量去引領大衆，誘掖大衆之現實的鬥爭，來建成我們文學在偉大的民族革命戰爭中底鬥爭的任務；而且也是爲了要在今日的文學戰鬥的過程中，奠定我們明日的文學的基礎，我們要在新的文學創造方向之上，具體的把握我們民族歷史的特點，提取我們民族革命的精華，批判我們民族的生活，學習我們大衆的鬥爭，而且吸收我們全部文學的歷史遺產，藉以建樹我們明日的文學，使我們明日的文學獲得其輝煌發展的前提，因此我們今日不祇需求文學上的大衆化，而且更需要文學上的新的創造方向，要從大衆生活的績壘之中，從民族歷史的內蘊之中，從一切中國語言藝術的積極因素之中，進行全盆的批判與融匯，建立一種今日能够有機地參加戰鬥，而明日又能輝耀地發揚光大的文學創造方向。</p>
<p>新的文學創造方向之建立，是一種中國文學之有機的强化和有効的提高，這是中國文學進向於全新的光明世界，進向於國際文學之輝煌燦爛的寶座底必由的道路，這裏，不僅意味着中國文學的大衆化，也不僅意味着中國文學水準之提高，而且，它是這大衆化與提高化的統一體，它一方面以其本身的中國色彩與大衆件質而獲得大衆化，一方面又以其基於現實基礎上之諸種文學機構之新的創造而獲得水準的提高，所以它一方面是大衆化的，是『降低的』，而同時却又是明日的向上的要，「提高」的。</p>
<p>中國文學之新的創造方向底建樹，應該是今日我們底重要的工作之一，我們不能不執行這一工作，正猶同我們不能不執行戰鬥一樣。</p>
<h3>我要醒</h3>
<p>— 俊伯</p>
<p>我是孤獨的，我每天生活在狐獨的夢裏。慣用思想的筆，描出一幅美麗的圖畫。</p>
<p>夢是我熟悉的同伴，我不曾在夢裏有一囘失意。當覺得愁悵的時候，或者有一點沉鬱，那麽，我就把呼吸緊鎖在酣夢的深谷，靜待那一只温郁的手，抹掉我心上的一片秋。</p>
<p>夢時寂寞的；我做過許多寂寞的夢。有時感到痛苦後的疲倦，那我不妨就飲一杯寂寞的酒。看着簷頭水滴，傾聽微細的風掠過庭園的楓尖，我開始遙想許多金色的故事，接着就跌入了寂寞的夢中。我看見自已的夥子伴着昔日的歡笑；也許我還模到失去了的温暖。沒有咒詛，不是怨恨；緊握着記憶的夢，夢裏有寂寞的歡喜。</p>
<p>向着蒼茫的天涯，呼喚旣逝的年華。心是沈痛的。無意招一招手，借着天雁的翅膀，我又摸索向夢中的道路了。「夢中無歲月」，我又寂寞地笑了。笑是孤獨的，有誰伴着它呢？除了那　頭的水滴，庭院裏微細的風。</p>
<p>於是，我痛苦得哭了。被夢淫亂過的心又驟而氷冷了。揉一揉眼，我說：「夢是空的，那遝不是一楊虛渺的變幻？」</p>
<p>伸手抱着遼闊的世界，我不想再做夢了，夢後的惆悵　將我折磨。趕快趨這現實的烽火，打起一身壯健的精神，沐浴在時代的風雨中。</p>
<p>眞的，我要醒，再也不去追求那金色的謊了！</p>
<h3>撲向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>她們走到一條溝邊停下來，有的人走得更遠，多半到了她們所走的遠度就不再走。</p>
<p>南方是温暖的，田裏的農作物茂盛地長着，大地的香氣在空中蕩漾着，只是在每個人的臉上，掛着一層恐懼的面容。</p>
<p>可是一切仍都是平靜的，看不貝飛機的影子，也沒有機聲。火車沒有來，她們也只得坐在田畔等待着。</p>
<p>『這就算是警報了，有什麽好怕！』</p>
<p>靜聞把水菓籃打開，一面檢出一只橘子剝着吃一面像是毫不在意地說。</p>
<p>靑芷沒有理她只在看着一個老婦人伏在地上索索地抖着。她的頭髮已經白了，伏在那裏，好像等着土地會裂開，容她躱到裏面去似的。</p>
<p>那個靑年人走過去扶起地來，和她說了許多她聽不懂的話，那個巷婦人　像聽從他似地仰起頭，坐在地上。她的臉可怕地痘攀看，他的多縐紋的面頰，聚集着流下來的淚水。</p>
<p>『請你千萬不要笑她，』那個靑年人再步過來的時候向她說：『她就是××墟的人，兩天前她的一家都炸光了，只逃出她這一條老命。她這是到省城去找她的兒子。』　（完）</p>

<p>壽險理率</p>
<h3>人壽保險與提倡敎育</h3>
<p>— 古卓崙</p>
<p>家長對於子弟有兩個重要的使命：一曰養，二曰敎。其實敦的問題就是養的問題：反過來說，不能敎使不能養所以敎與養同，重要，或者敎的比賽的問題更重要呢！所以爲家長者，設爲子弟將來計，不必斤斤於遺產之經營，首當注意到敎育之計劃，富有財資者，能够預先撥出一宗基金使子弟到相當年齡，便由小學而中學，而大學，那就極好不過了；但手裏不大充裕，無可預撥大宗欵項的時候，就成一個問題。最善的方法，莫若投保敎育年金保壽，這個保法却有幾個優點：</p>
<p>（一）對於敎育基金可以預爲按年繳納，無一次提撥之吃力，而且保養低廉，如每年繳費三數十元，便有一千元之準備，輕而易舉，人人可以辦到。</p>
<p>（二）於敎育基金可以確定，不受中途攀故之影響，因人壽保險付生存還欵，死亡賠款之優點，假如投保之後，不論何時，遭遇會外，雖供過保費爲數無多，在公司方而仍要負起賠款責任，於保單滿胡時，依約付款爲被保戰人攻積之費用，與在銀行按年存歙，一遭不測，僅得領取所儲數目，就大大不同了。</p>
<p>（三）敎育年金係分期支取，自不至挪作別用，因學校敎育是有一定年限的，整筆領取，往往因一時緊急，容易移作別用，必須分期提取，方可達到栽培子弟之目的，有此幾項優點，對於敎育年金保養的意義大可明白了，古人說得好，子係離愚，書書不可讀，讀後要踐。就當及早預備，今日省却一些雜支，爲兒女供學保費，實在是十分値得注意的。</p>
<p>壽險事業</p>
<h3>中日二國壽險事業之比較</h3>
<p>— 李權時</p>
<p>永安人爲保險公司爲宣揚壽險事業之重要起見，在香港申報特輯壽險專刊，月各一期，茲當二期撰繞之秋，特徵文及予，予以盛意難却，乃不自揣譾陋，述中日二國壽險事業之比較，以就正於賢達。</p>
<p>溯我國開關較日本早十二年（我國正式開關在一八四二年，而日本則一八五四年），照理一切近代化工作，包括壽險事業之發達在內，亦皆應較日本爲進展。然而按諸事實，却大謬不然。此其故本文不欲深淪。茲僅就中日二國壽險事業之榮枯情形言之，其他蓋亦可推想而知焉。</p>
<p>日本自尊王孫夷及明治維新以還，事事效法西洋之科學化，其對於金融組織，亦擬有完備之系統而行之：除中央銀行，特殊銀行，貯蓄銀行，信託公司，及證券會社外復有各種保殮公司之設立，而其保險公司之體系，則大致又分火災，海上，動產等，承保財產損失風隊之公司，及生命，徵乓，簡易生命，郵政年金等承保生命損失風險之公司（分股份及相互二種）及國營機關兩種，茲列近五年來日本壽險業之進展統計如下，以資參攷：</p>

<h3>爲投保人進一言</h3>
<p>— 周延旦</p>
<p>吾國人之保險事業，在距今五十年前。方吿萌芽。初由外國公司招致吾國人士投保，迨民國元年始有華商資本經營之公司，其後繼興者大小約有十餘家，吾國壽險事業，經過數十餘年之倡導，已樹有相當之基礎，以言發達，猶須待吾人之努力推進，始能收効於將來也。</p>
<p>（一）勿迷信命運</p>
<p>考吾國以前民智閉塞，社會上多數人士，對其一生事業之成敗，動輒歸咎於命運及緻水，頭腦冬烘，知識寡陋，絕不知有所謂科學常識者。故臨事旣乏敏銳之眼光，詳加考察，作縝密之計劃，又不能防患於未燃，預籌應付之道，設一且遇有不幸事情發生，則惟有抱怨時運不濟，或猜疑組宗山瑩之不住耳。要知吾人生於斯世。有種種危險情形之遭遇。例如火災，殘廢，死亡等是也。此種危險之發主，就個人言，則無預爲防止之可能，但爲財產經濟能力之損失則有設法救濟之必要，各神保險之功用，在使慮有同種危險之多數人，各出相當之醵金，以救濟被災者，而圖各人之安全。倘慮危險死亡，可用人壽保險以補償其因死亡所受之損失也。</p>
<p>（二）宜擁擠華資公司：</p>
<p>考吾國過去之壽險事業，多爲外商資本之公司所操縱，每年滬巵不可勝數，迨至最近二三十年間，有志之士，為愛國心所騙使，求挽救之方，於是乃組織華商公司，經營人壽保險事業，然而一般社會人上，稱以爲外國公司，歷史悠久，信用校佳，故投保者每以外國公司是鵠，此種觀察和心理之錯誤，殆因未明瞭壽險公司之組織所致耳，要知壽險公司，一切組織，均以科學方法爲根據，對於承保數額，不論大小，均須提出一種準備金，此種準備金，乃係依照死亡表，投資利率，經精密之計算者，夫向外國公司投保壽險，則年中所納之保費，悉數匯往外國投資，利潤外溢，爲害殊鉅，丁此民竊財困國家多難之狄，凡我國民，允宜急起，擁護華商資本公司，藉以增强國家之經濟力量焉。</p>

<h3>Do Not Attempt to Save Japan with Economics ×</h3>
<p>A righteous cause makes one bold. It's not merely about justifying the name, but also about the inability to compromise on the distinction between right and wrong. Who is the leader of the aggressors? The responsibility lies with them. China fights for survival and to safeguard the independence and freedom of its nation. This will undoubtedly be recognized by the world and future generations. But what does Japan fight for?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, Japan claimed that the three northeastern provinces of China, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, were vital to their lifeline, and therefore they fought to protect their life. To regard the people, territory, and rich resources of a neighboring country as one's own lifeline and attempt to seize them by force is obviously unjustifiable. In the middle of the war, Japan claimed that China was being communized and that they were fighting to suppress communism. China established itself on the Three Principles of the People, which even the Communist Party professes to follow, demonstrating the falsity of the communization claim. Moreover, what does a neighbor's ideology have to do with them? Japan also claimed that East Asia needed a new order and that they were fighting to establish that new order. What is this new order? It means those who obey me live, and those who resist me die, using an iron fist to enslave other races and prevent them from ever rising again. Establishing a new order is nothing more than establishing a master-servant relationship; there is no other meaning. Japan also claimed that they were staking their national fortune on a single throw, and therefore fighting to place China's sovereignty under their control (as stated by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on May 24th). The logic of their words and principles is no different from saying, "I'm risking everything, so I'm going to commit murder." All these claims are disjointed and completely unfounded. It is no wonder that even after years of war, members of the Japanese Diet still questioned their government, asking, "What is Japan fighting for?"</p>
<p>However, the essence of China's resistance is extremely clear. Therefore, if one wants China to stop fighting, one only needs to restore China's sovereignty, land, and administrative integrity. Because Japan's cause is unjustified, the only way to resolve the war is through war itself. In other words, either they win to the point where they no longer need to fight, or they are defeated to the point where they cannot fight anymore. If one seeks a way to resolve the war outside of war, the world has long abandoned such thoughts. However, a recent Reuters dispatch from London reported that Sir Basham, a British expert, made a grand pronouncement, the gist of which was:</p>
<p>"Within Japan, there are differing views on the government's current policies. Businessmen do not approve of the war against China and believe that peace is the best path for trade. The current situation in the Far East is a direct result of global economic policies. As countries implement protectionist tariffs, Japan, with a population of 100 million and an annual increase of one million, has extremely limited domestic resources. Although the entire territory has been cultivated, it is still a poor country. Businessmen and non-military people have told me that they are prepared to resolve the China issue and are willing to live in harmony with China. However, they do not know how to achieve this goal without losing face. In short, Japan must withdraw from China, but to achieve this, the world should plan for Japan's future, enabling it to sell its goods, feed its population, and maintain a reasonable standard of living. From a military perspective, Japan's finances are strained and cannot allow the current situation to continue. From this perspective, Japan will adopt a reasonable attitude in the near future."</p>
<p>Sir Basham is a famous British economist who, after traveling to Japan, returned to England and recently delivered the above speech at a gathering on international affairs. The dispatch likely only conveyed a fraction of his insightful arguments. While the arguments of cause and effect are insightful and based on truth, which those concerned with Japan's wartime internal affairs will be happy to hear, there are also a few points in the excerpt that do not form a cause-and-effect relationship. This must be due to the brevity of the dispatch, and it is unlikely that a renowned scholar would contradict himself. After hearing this from afar, we cannot help but say: Sir Basham claims that Japan is a poor country and that the current situation in the Far East is a result of the world's current economic policies, suggesting that this is the reason for Japan's invasion of China. He also suggests that the world should plan for Japan's economic future, seemingly implying that this is the way to end Japan's invasion of China. If Sir Basham is correct, then the answer to the question of why Japan is fighting, which both Japanese and non-Japanese people have been asking, lies here. But is that really the case?</p>
<p>Sir Basham is a renowned economist. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Therefore, an economist's view of all phenomena is from an economic perspective. We do not consider Sir Basham's view to be biased. Human civilization has evolved over thousands of years to the present day, encompassing international and social issues. While solutions to problems are sought through religion, general culture, science, and even war, attributing everything to economics is something we are willing to acknowledge. Perhaps Sir Basham's statement is not fundamentally wrong. The pity is that Japan does not act accordingly. To put it another way, Japan cannot escape this principle in reality. The pity is that the Japanese do not realize this themselves. In today's international competition, regardless of political measures, military planning, or actions, if one takes economics as the guiding principle, then politics and military affairs are merely tools. Japan is not like that. They are still drunkenly focused on realizing their military ideals and fulfilling their political aspirations. They regard economics as merely a tool. Therefore, from the initial invasion of China to the present day, the various explanations and expressions of their authorities have never suggested that their desires lie in economics. They fundamentally criticize their acts of military aggression and violate the ironclad rules of economics. We cannot elaborate on this in this short article, but at least the fact that China has historically provided Japan with opportunities to develop its economy and alleviate its poverty in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, yet they have never fully utilized them, can serve as counter-evidence that Japan's consciousness and desires do not lie in economics. That is to say, the cause of the invasion of China after the September 18th Incident and the disasters in the Far East over the past few years does not lie in economics.</p>
<p>The fault in the Far East lies with Japan, the responsibility lies with Japan, but Japan's consciousness and desires do not lie in economics. Therefore, Sir Basham's suggestion to plan for Japan's economy is not enough to prompt Japan to change its course. This can be asserted with certainty. Therefore, in today's situation, China has no choice but to resist, and all friendly nations must also recognize that the only way to resolve the war is through war itself. There is no need to harbor any other hope. If there is hope for a resolution outside of war, it must wait for Japan to fully awaken and abandon its political aspirations and military ideals. Otherwise, providing them with an economic lifeline will only strengthen their political ambitions and military expansion.</p>

<h3>On Guerrilla Warfare in Flat Terrain</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shiti</p>
<p>I. Flat terrain is level, and there are many roads. Enemy assaults are easier than in mountainous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly study the enemy's situation, judge the enemy's situation, and understand the enemy's actions and intentions in a timely manner.</p>
<p>II. Increase vigilance and be careful to keep all secrets of our army. All movements of the troops must be rapid and light, so that they can move and fight at any time.</p>
<p>III. Strengthen reconnaissance and guard (reconnaissance and guard have been detailed above). Pay special attention to reconnaissance and guard at night and before dawn. Scouts should be sent out around the enemy to ensure that every move of the enemy is known in a timely manner. Strengthen communication and liaison in all aspects so that the situation can be transmitted quickly.</p>
<p>IV. The best way to prevent enemy attacks is to actively engage, especially by frequently using small units to attack and harass the enemy. This will not only put the enemy in a passive position, exhausting them to deal with us, but also create difficulties, panic, weaknesses, and mistakes for the enemy, which will benefit us in eliminating the enemy.</p>
<p>V. Pre-know the handling of the enemy's attack on us (this relies on reconnaissance work).</p>
<p>A. Even if our troops are superior to the enemy in strength, they can also leave the enemy's targeted area. Use a small unit to contain the enemy on the front and disrupt their deployment. The main force shifts to the enemy's side or rear to attack them, or ambush them midway.</p>
<p>B. Retreat completely, occupying the target that the enemy intends to attack. A small number of plainclothes scouts secretly and continuously conduct reconnaissance near the enemy. The main force ambushes the road that the enemy must take when retreating, but pay attention to secret intentions. It is best for our army to retreat completely in a false direction, and then move to the ambush location, or retreat with light and heavy luggage in another direction. The combat troops detour secretly to the ambush location to confuse and deceive the enemy. This type of action requires accurate judgment of the enemy's situation. For example, when the enemy attacked Hongkou Town in Wutai on November 3, we estimated that the enemy was more likely to retreat back to Wutai, but they would definitely rest during the day and may act at night. If they did not retreat on the night of the 3rd, they would retreat before dawn on the 4th, so we decided to ambush near Huashikou (where the terrain is better). As a result, at about 9:00 PM on the 5th, our army was just at Huashikou, conducting reconnaissance of the terrain and deploying for the attack, when the enemy was caught off guard and we won a great victory.</p>
<p>C. If the enemy is superior, we should avoid the enemy's attack and quickly shift positions, but still conduct guerrilla warfare to confuse and harass the enemy, making it difficult for the enemy to find the direction of our shift and continue to attack. At the same time, there should be plainclothes scouts secretly conducting continuous reconnaissance near the enemy to understand the enemy's actions in a timely manner.</p>
<p>VI. Handling the situation when the enemy attacks us without prior knowledge and the enemy is already approaching our guard troops (this situation only occurs without reconnaissance):</p>
<p>A. The guard troops must do their best to put up a strong resistance, regardless of the losses, to buy time for the main force to complete combat preparations or other arrangements, so that the enemy cannot approach the main force.</p>
<p>B. If the enemy is superior, the main force must quickly retreat to a favorable direction, with an organized force to cover the retreat, avoiding chaos and preventing the enemy from continuing to pursue. At this time, if there are enemy troops nearby, neighboring units should send troops to harass the enemy on the side or rear, so that our troops under enemy attack can safely shift positions.</p>
<p>C. If our troops are superior and the enemy has penetrated deep into our area, under favorable conditions, we can also use a force to control the enemy on the front, and the main force can attack the enemy from the side or rear, or secretly move to the side of the road that the enemy must take when retreating and annihilate them when they retreat.</p>
<p>VII. Handling the situation when suddenly attacked by the enemy (this situation only occurs when reconnaissance and guard are not paid attention to):</p>
<p>(1) When suddenly attacked by the enemy, we are in a disadvantageous position and should quickly move to disengage from the enemy, or take the opportunity to counterattack and defeat them. If we have been surrounded by multiple layers of the enemy, we should retreat quickly and systematically.</p>
<p>(2) If the main force has broken through, but a part of it is surrounded by the enemy and cannot break through, then the troops that have broken through should, depending on the situation, try to rescue nearby friendly neighbors as much as possible, and the friendly neighbors must do their best to help. At this time, it can be estimated that the enemy's troops are often chaotic during combat, and they are proud of their victory and will inevitably neglect their guard, which is conducive to our sudden counterattack and victory. Therefore, a decision can be made quickly according to the situation at that time.</p>
<p>(3) When surrounded by the enemy, it is important to avoid escaping separately and running away in disorder. It is important to know that under any danger, being resolute, brave, calm, and organized in attacking the weak points of the enemy can lead to escaping from danger. If defensive measures are taken, the danger will gradually increase, and there is a risk of being annihilated by the enemy (it is only possible to hold out if it is estimated that our army can quickly reinforce and there is really no way to break through; this is an exception). On August 3rd of last year, two companies of our ×× guerrilla team were in Erchongzigou. At dawn, the enemy secretly approached and annihilated their sentry, and continued to surround and attack the main force. The guerrilla team did not concentrate their main force to attack the enemy in order to escape, but held on to the village, resisting bravely and stubbornly, resulting in the martyrdom of all of them.</p>
<p>(VIII) How to deal with the enemy's siege?</p>
<p>A. The guerrilla base areas within the enemy's occupied areas and the guerrilla teams operating on the enemy's flanks and rear are a thorn in the enemy's side. The enemy often adopts a group attack method against these base areas. Enemy sieges are more convenient in flat terrain than in mountainous areas. Therefore, scattered teams operating in flat terrain should always pay attention to the enemy's sieges.</p>
<p>B. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the enemy has carried out countless sieges against guerrilla base areas in North China, such as the large-scale three-pronged siege of northwestern Shanxi in February and March of last year, the large-scale siege of southeastern Shanxi in April, and several sieges of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, especially the five-pronged siege by 50,000 troops in September, October, and November of last year; the areas of the ×th Detachment in Huainingzuo, You, etc. in the four-pronged siege in January; the ×th Detachment ×th Regiment Factory Hanying area under three (each time three to five prongs) national attacks by our ×th Detachment from August to November; the five-pronged siege of the Mokanshan ×th Detachment in September; and the three-pronged siege of the □th Detachment in Miaoergou Dayushu south of Suiyuan in October, and the five-pronged siege of the □th Detachment in Yugoukouzi, Hongzhao area northeast of Guihua in November. These sieges took a great deal of effort from the enemy, but they were all crushed and defeated by us, causing them heavy losses. Keeping these areas in our hands to this day shows that we have the methods and strength to smash the enemy's sieges, and we believe that we can continue to smash the enemy's sieges in the future.</p>
<p>C. Most of the lessons we have learned come from the enemy's sieges of mountainous areas, but the terrain conditions of mountainous areas and flat terrain are different, which affects the tactics for dealing with enemy sieges. For example, in March of last year, we finally smashed the enemy's siege of northwestern Shanxi by waiting in ambush with the main force of the □□ Brigade □□ Brigade on both sides between Ningwu Yangfangkou for five or six days, trying to force the retreat of the Ningwu ×, and then attacking them in coordination while also being able to attack the Shuoxian reinforcements. As a result, after three fierce battles, we succeeded. But if it were flat terrain, it would not be possible. For example, in October, more than 2,000 enemy troops in Hunyuan, Daying, and Guangling divided into three routes to besiege the Darenzhuang area. Our □□ guerrilla unit, consisting of hundreds of people, used the area of Darenzhuang Mountain, which was 60 to 70 li wide and 40 to 50 li long, to play circles with the enemy for three days. The enemy suffered more than 100 casualties, while we suffered no losses. But this would not be possible in flat terrain. Therefore, dealing with enemy sieges in flat terrain is somewhat different from dealing with them in mountainous areas. The following are some questions about dealing with enemy sieges in flat terrain:</p>
<p>[1] The enemy has many means of transportation, which can be fully used in flat terrain [such as a bullock cart road, it can barely drive a car]. The enemy's mobilization and concentration are faster. Therefore, we have very thorough and reliable reconnaissance to understand the enemy's siege intentions in a timely manner and be prepared.</p>
<p>[2] Guerrilla teams and guerrilla groups frequently operate actively near the enemy, which can help to understand the enemy's actions and intentions in a timely manner, and sometimes can also disrupt the enemy's siege deployments or plans.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Balance of International Payments: Ministry of Finance Implements Import Controls, Expected to Save Over 200 Million Yuan in Foreign Exchange Annually; Rewards Export Settlements by Granting Exchange Rate Differentials</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement regarding the significance of the announced "Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times": Maintaining the balance of international payments is a key element of any country's economic policy, and during wartime, trade tends to become adverse. It is especially important for the government to adopt various methods to maintain the balance, so as not to affect the national economy and hinder the progress of the war. China's trade surplus is substantial, but most of the defense supplies needed during wartime, as well as industrial and transportation equipment, still rely on imports. If the adverse trend in the balance of international payments is not reversed, it will inevitably affect the foreign purchasing market and hinder the economy.</p>
<p>To address this, the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade" was drafted in September 1937, establishing three adjustment committees for agriculture, industry, mining, and trade, and allocating funds to handle military insurance. This is indeed an essential wartime economic policy. At the same time, a management import plan to prohibit current quota licenses was drafted and submitted for approval. However, for various reasons, the management import plan was not approved for implementation. Later, in March of last year, when foreign trade management was implemented, a management import plan was proposed again, selecting several types of luxury goods and semi-luxury goods to be banned or restricted from import. For goods necessary for the War of Resistance, national construction, and daily use, the government banks were allowed to sell foreign exchange at the legal price. However, due to external concerns, this was not implemented.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the × puppets have taken advantage of our tax revenues and plundered our material gains to illegally exchange large sums of legal currency for foreign exchange in Macau, causing an unprecedented surge in the foreign exchange market. Since the establishment of the stabilization fund and the entry of British banks into the stabilization effort, which was originally intended as a gesture of British support and a way to facilitate international trade, the stabilization effort has been threatened and faced difficulties. During the War of Resistance, the people should practice frugality, reduce unnecessary consumption, and increase their purchasing power for necessities, in line with the principle of "military first, victory first." After careful discussion, it was unanimously agreed that prohibiting the import of some goods is a necessary wartime measure, which will surely be understood by people at home and abroad. All goods that are not essential for the War of Resistance, national construction, and daily life, or those that are partially needed but can be replaced by domestic products, or those that are mostly manufactured by × countries and are easily counterfeited and sold under false pretenses when imported, should be prohibited from import.</p>
<p>Therefore, import prohibition measures were drafted in accordance with the above standards, selecting prohibited items. These include foreign liquor, foreign cigarettes, seafood, silk goods, cosmetics, ornaments, toys, musical instruments, some sugar products, meat, fruits, vegetables, as well as woolen goods, cotton goods, timber, paper, bamboo and wooden rattan products, earthen stoneware products, and liquid fuels for which substitutes can be found, totaling 234 tariff code numbers, all of which are subject to prohibition. The Ministry has already telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs to instruct all customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports from the date of receipt of the order.</p>
<p>In summary, after prohibiting the import of the above items, based on the import volume of the 1931 census, it is estimated that over 230 million yuan can be saved, equivalent to approximately US$68 million or £13 million. This huge amount of foreign exchange expenditure can then be diverted to purchase essential materials for the War of Resistance and national construction. This is merely a change in the use of foreign exchange for our country, and it is merely a change in the goods imported by various countries. In substance, the statistics of trade with China will not be greatly reduced, and full understanding from friendly countries can be obtained.</p>
<p>Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods</p>
<p>(1) In accordance with the 18 groups and 234 tariff code numbers of goods recorded by customs and listed in the attached table, the Ministry of Finance orders the Inspector General of Customs to instruct all customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports.</p>
<p>(2) The above-mentioned prohibited import goods shall not be reported for transit transport after the prohibition order is promulgated.</p>
<p>(3) For prohibited import goods, if they are to adjust the market price in the rear, supply special purposes, or have other legitimate reasons, and are approved by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may review and issue a special purchase and transportation permit based on international needs. The regulations for issuing permits will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>(4) The provisions of these measures shall also apply to prohibited import goods that are sent by parcel post from overseas or transferred from domestic ports for transit. A detailed table of the names and code numbers of prohibited import goods will be published separately in newspapers.</p>
<p>Significance of Receiving Exchange Rate Difference</p>
<p>The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement on the significance of the announced "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference for Export Goods": The significance and measures for prohibiting non-essential import goods have already been announced separately. At the same time, the Ministry has always regarded the issue of promoting export trade as extremely important. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade" was drafted, trade adjustment agencies were organized, and various adjustment measures were promulgated. In June of last year, measures to maintain production and promote exports were promulgated, in addition to using methods such as tax exemptions, guaranteed military tax, convenient transportation, and financial accommodation to assist merchants in operating export trade. Government trade agencies will also purchase from a distance to increase exports and boost production. However, recently, due to transportation difficulties and increased transportation of domestic products, the export volume has decreased. Under these circumstances, merchants are burdened with increased costs and insufficient capital, and they inevitably harbor doubts about operating exports. Foreign trading companies that have been operating exports in the country are also in an unusual trading situation or are even halting operations. All of this is hindering exports, which is contrary to the Ministry's original intention of maintaining the national economy. Due to the recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, in order to assist the stabilization effort and alleviate its difficulties, the Ministry has drafted "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference for Export Goods." Except for tung oil, tea leaves, pig bristles, and mineral products, which are related to barter trade and stockpiling, the remaining export goods must sell foreign exchange at the legal price to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. The Bank of China or the Bank of Communications will provide the equivalent legal price and the difference between the bank's selling price. In this way, most export goods can be freely transported and sold. The substantial exchange rate difference, after paying the fees, can still yield a surplus. All the difficulties of merchants are resolved by the government. The government's foreign exchange can still be concentrated on maintaining the legal currency and stabilizing the financial system. It can also promote exports and increase production, which is beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Measures for Receiving Exchange Rate Difference</p>
<p>(1) All export goods shall settle foreign exchange. Except for tung oil, tea leaves, pig bristles, and mineral products, which are related to barter trade and stockpiling and should be purchased and sold by government trade agencies at preferential prices on an ad hoc basis, taking into account production and sales conditions and international market prices, all other goods, whether transported and sold by government trade agencies or traded independently by commercial firms, must sell the foreign exchange earned at the legal price to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. The legal currency to be paid for the selling price shall be agreed upon by the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications with the person settling the foreign exchange and paid in legal currency at the designated increase.</p>
<p>(2) For the export goods that have settled foreign exchange at the legal price in the previous paragraph, after the actual settlement of the foreign exchange amount, a settlement certificate may be obtained and the legal price may be collected from the settling bank. The settling bank may collect the handling fee that the bank should obtain from the person settling the foreign exchange, but it shall not exceed 3%.</p>
<p>(3) The exchange fee in the previous paragraph shall be paid in legal currency at the inland location approved by the settlement bank with the consent of the person settling the foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Tianjin × Arrogance Is Extremely High, Another British Resident Humiliated, Concession Advises British Residents Not to Leave the Concession Area, British Warship Arrives in Tianjin to Investigate Towboat Detained</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 2nd] There have been no reports of foreigners being forcibly stripped and searched in recent days. This is largely due to the authorities' announcement advising British residents not to leave the sealed-off concession unless absolutely necessary. However, another incident occurred today. A young British man named Anderson, born in Tianjin and employed by the "Peking and Tientsin Times," went from the British Concession to the former German Concession this afternoon to visit his widowed mother, whom he had not seen for a long time. When he passed the barrier on Wilson Street, he showed his pass, which was passed on by a puppet police officer to a Japanese military policeman. The Japanese military policeman asked Anderson if he was British, and after receiving an affirmative answer, he handed the pass to a Japanese officer. The officer ordered Anderson to take off his hat, saying, "It is impolite not to take off your hat when talking." Anderson immediately complied. The officer then asked if Anderson could speak Chinese, and Anderson replied, "Yes," and was forced to remove his glasses and strip off his clothes for inspection. The Japanese officer then said, "Do you think you are British and don't need to be afraid?" He then struck Anderson in the face twice with the pass. He then threw the pass into the pile of clothes and allowed Anderson to put on his clothes and pass through the barrier. Later, when Anderson returned to the concession, he was not stopped at another barrier.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 1st] In view of China's huge demand for machine oil, the Tsinghua University Research Institute has recently been engaged in research and experimentation on refining machine oil from various domestically produced vegetable oils. The results show that the machine oil refined from flaxseed oil produced in Yunnan is the best. It is in no way inferior to imported machine oil, but the price is half as cheap. It was handed over to the Southwest Transportation Company by the Institute, and the results were very good.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Li Huang; Enemy Planes Spied on Jiangxi Twice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Li Huang, 1st] On the 30th, at 8:20 AM, eleven enemy planes, and at 1:00 PM, six enemy planes, successively swooped down on Li Huang, dropping seventy or eighty bombs. Dozens of civilian houses inside and outside the city were destroyed, and dozens of people were killed or injured, creating a very tragic situation. Liu Zhenru, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Executive Committee, in addition to dispatching all working comrades of the Provincial Executive Committee and students of the cadre training class to conduct propaganda in different directions, also consulted with the Central Relief Committee and specially dispatched Dharma Master Changhong to allocate an emergency aid of 2,000 yuan. At the same time, he ordered the Li Huang County Party Department to cooperate with the County Government to investigate the households affected by the disaster, compile a register and submit a report, so that the Provincial Party Department can preside over the distribution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 1st] Four enemy planes spied on Jiangxi in two separate waves today. The first wave, consisting of two planes, intruded from the border at 8:00 AM, spying on the border areas such as Suichuan, Huiyuan, and Ningdu. They then turned towards Nanfeng and fled. The second wave, consisting of two planes, took off from northern Jiangxi at 1:00 PM, circled over Shanggao for about ten minutes, and then left.</p>
<h3>Hebei Guerrilla Force; Appears and Disappears Like Ghosts; Attacks Trains and Seizes Enemy Armaments; Enemy Ammunition Explodes in Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 2nd] Guerrilla forces on both sides in the Beijing area have been extremely active this week, achieving remarkable feats. According to military sources, two trains were recently destroyed. One was 25 [distance unit missing] from Beijing, and the other was in Jixian, northern Henan, where the Japanese army had newly built a railway [number of] people to Kaifeng. This week, along the Xiaohan Railway, Dingxian was in contact [with the enemy]. The Japanese army and Chinese guerrillas, totaling 25,000 men, engaged in fierce battles. Reliable news from Shijiazhuang states that many wounded Japanese soldiers are being transported there, mostly from Shanxi. Guerrilla forces in central and western Shanxi are extremely active, frequently attacking the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 2nd] According to reliable sources, Chinese guerrilla forces have recently repeatedly attacked Japanese-occupied areas in Tianjin, seizing large quantities of armaments and bullets. Residents in the concessions can hear gunfire.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 1st] On the 13th of last month at noon, bombs used on enemy planes, along with other vehicles, were transported by train to Shijiazhuang.

<h3>The Fall of Shantou City (4)</h3>
<p>— Lin Gao</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>The night gradually deepened. The enemy planes, enemy boats, and enemy artillery all ceased their activities, and weariness replaced terror, creeping into people's minds and bodies.</p>
<p>"Oh no! Shantou is on fire!"</p>
<p>In the northern center of the city, a wisp of white smoke rose, with a burning red flame below it. Then, a second and a third fire started, all connected together. Half the sky was dyed red, and sparks flew up like "setting off fireworks." The faint sound of explosions could be heard.</p>
<p>The searchlights on the enemy warships turned on. A strong beam of light, like a long tongue spat out by a venomous snake, greedily gnawed at the houses, stacks, and docks on the shore. Shantou, about to fall into the clutches of the devil, turned into scorched earth. How disheartened and anxious were the Chinese watching this beautiful place lost. The searchlight constantly shifted back and forth between the towering buildings.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the sky was slightly lighter. An enemy boat docked by the breakwater. Two dark green [animal] carrying a flag like blood droplets splattered on the sun, climbed onto the breakwater and used a bamboo pole to erect the flag on a wooden boat inside the pond. They immediately slipped back into the boat, paused for a moment, but seeing that everything was still calm, they climbed back onto the breakwater, waving flag signals like monkeys.</p>
<p>Then another enemy boat docked at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf. Ten enemy soldiers divided into three groups, walking lightly, slightly stooped. They slowly walked from the China Merchants Bureau pier, turned a corner, and entered a small alley leading north to the China Merchants Road. Suddenly, as if they had touched electricity, they all retreated and leaned against the wall. After a long time, they continued to move forward step by step.</p>
<p>Enemy troops in formation landed at the Yuanheng Wharf, the China Merchants Wharf, and in front of the Customs House. In the distance, there was a burst of sporadic gunfire, but then everything was quiet. The enemy flag, with blood droplets splattered, also flew on the flagpole of the Chao-Hai Customs. Enemy flags were hung in many places along the coast, on the docks, and on the high buildings behind the foreign stacks. Turning around, the emblems of the robbers were also spread all over Jiaoshi Mountain.</p>
<p>The beautiful city of Shantou thus fell into enemy hands, allowing the enemy to trample and ravage it.</p>
<p>A large, wide-bellied boat loaded with soybean cakes was docked in front of the Customs House, likely unable to move out of the harbor when the enemy warships entered. The enemy troops recruited many vagrants, and an officer held a flag and stood next to them, allowing them to carry the cakes. The entire boat, with nearly 2,000 soybean cakes worth six to seven thousand yuan, was looted in less than ten minutes. More than 100 compatriots and foreigners on the Guang Sheng Wheel all witnessed this fact of the enemy troops directing vagrants to loot.</p>
<p>Around 11 o'clock, a friend and his family boarded a motorboat used by foreigners. He said that on the night of the 21st, when there were no enemy planes, he wanted to escape Shantou City to avoid falling into enemy hands, but the streets were guarded by troops and they could not pass, so they escaped to the homes of foreigners. This morning, enemy troops were stationed at key traffic points in the city, searching pedestrians and robbing them of their belongings, and directing vagrants to loot property. They had borrowed a motorboat from foreigners and sailed directly from Qilu Beach, so they were able to reach the ship safely.</p>
<p>The clock on the Chao-Hai Customs House pointed to noon at twelve o'clock. The Guang Sheng Wheel set sail, passing by dozens of enemy warships with a mix of worry and anger. The enemy warships were unloading horses and armaments onto boats. An hour after the ship had sailed, the enemy ships were no longer visible, and there were no creek boats with sails scattered as usual. It was just a lonely expanse. There were no more searches. My heart was filled with anger, shame, and nostalgia.</p>
<p>Around four o'clock, the ship passed the boundary of Huilai County. Looking at the brown and yellow interspersed mountain peaks, I knew that the enemy must not have reached there yet. Friends, they must be at the foot of those mountain peaks, preparing for guerrilla warfare. Shantou City is within the range of the enemy navy and has no obstacles to defend, so its fall was expected long ago. Materials are scarce, and the elderly, weak, women, and children have mostly been evacuated. The enemy can occupy Shantou City, but they absolutely cannot occupy all the counties under Chaozhou. In places with undulating peaks and mountains, the enemy's armaments are ineffective. That will be the enemy's graveyard. The enemy's manpower and resources are exhausted. Occupying Shantou City will not only not gain him anything, but will accelerate his demise!</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 23rd, the Guang Sheng Wheel arrived in Hong Kong. After some twists and turns, all the righteous people on the ship were finally able to disembark at noon. The airplanes resounding in the Hong Kong sky were no longer the robbers spreading the seeds of murder, but most of those enjoying the revelry were our compatriots. (The End)</p>

Three thousand enemy troops were surrounded by us, and we launched a fierce attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. After completing the annihilation mission, our troops retreated. It is also reported that a fierce battle took place in Hushu, Suzhou. Our troops bombed the wooden houses where the enemy troops were stationed at night, killing 25 enemy troops, with only two wounded escaping. After our troops burned the wooden houses, they demolished several miles of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, so the railway has been closed for several days.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Guerrilla Areas; Intense Contact in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] The enemy is now trying to pacify the rear and their attacks on the occupied areas are still fierce, especially in China. Contact is constant in southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and southern Hebei.

On the 1st and 2nd, contact was continuous along both banks of the Han River within Jieyang, and the battle situation was chaotic.</p>
<p>[Continental News Agency, Huiyang Dispatch] Tian'an Xuanwu Temple and Longyan Mountain in Lufeng County have always been the lairs of long-haired bandits, who secretly set up organizations and plotted to stir up trouble. After repeated suppressions by military police, they have slightly restrained themselves. However, they have recently become rampant again, engaging in activities everywhere. In order to fundamentally eliminate bandits and avoid affecting the rear of the War of Resistance, Zou Wangzhen, the commander of the Lufeng County Security Regiment and the commander of the reserve brigade, and Dui Ruzhou, the magistrate of Lufeng County and the commander of the Self-Defense Regiment, have cooperated in dispatching teams and ordered township heads and Baojia chiefs to carry out suppression and appeasement simultaneously, and issued an announcement allowing self-renewal.

Military authorities here reported that the enemy troops in Xinhui had been completely evacuated to reinforce Chaozhou and Shantou. The current defense force is weak. The enemy troops in Jiangmen, under the constant pressure of our troops, have fallen into a state of encirclement on all sides, and the situation is shaking. There is a possibility of a complete general retreat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuwen, 1st] More than 400 enemy troops in Maicheng County, Hainan Island, invaded Shishandao Hall and other places under the county.

<h3>Germany Intensifies Military Preparations in Danzig; Britain and France Determined to Fulfill Obligations to Poland; Italy Intends to Take This Opportunity to Make Demands on France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 1st] Whether Hitler will visit Danzig at the end of July to accept the title of Honorary Citizen of Danzig, conferred by the citizens of Danzig on his birthday, has not yet been confirmed as of today. However, all preparations are being intensified. The local National Socialist Party's newspaper today discussed the relationship between the interests of Britain and France and Danzig, strongly arguing that Danzig must be returned to Germany. As for when the appropriate time will be, Hitler will declare it himself. Poland's current difficulty lies in whether to take action before the situation develops further, or to wait until the National Socialist Party's preparations are all completed before launching its move. Although the National Socialist Party denies taking any military action, news contrary to the denial is constantly leaking out. The National Socialist Party's dockyard has been closed for two nights, and even the night watchmen are not allowed to stay in the dockyard. It is said that after the armaments arrive there, they are transferred elsewhere by car. It has become a public fact that troops from East Prussia are driving through the city of Danzig in cars. The hotel directly opposite the central railway station has been used for offices for officials. A notice was issued at the beginning of this week to requisition horses, followed by all automobiles. All automobile owners have received notices ordering them to prepare everything in order to respond to the emergency. The Albin Road, which leads directly to East Prussia, is extremely important militarily. It has now been locked down and private vehicles are not allowed to pass through. Road repairs are being intensified, and all materials have been stockpiled so that a pontoon bridge can be built across the Vistula River at Lesbitter within an hour. At the same time, the unconfirmed but un-denied rumor of the devaluation of the Polish currency has caused great fluctuations in local business. Both sides are now trying to avoid any provocative acts. The National Socialist Party has no intention of launching a large-scale attack. Poland seems to be taking a monitoring stance. Today, all British newspapers were confiscated. It is explained that this is to keep local residents from being aware of the external situation. However, people of all levels are gradually feeling that Germany's military actions in Danzig will inevitably lead to direct action by Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck met this afternoon with Chatajski, the Polish commissioner to Danzig, who had returned from Danzig, to hear a report on the German Nazi Party's military preparations in Danzig. It is expected that the two may have discussed the form of a memorandum to be sent to the Danzig Senate, asking the Senate to explain the reasons for the military preparations in the demilitarized zone of Danzig. Well-informed sources do not believe that these military preparations dare be a prelude to a sudden move, given the warning issued by British Foreign Secretary Halifax. It is generally believed that the Nazi Party is now adopting a strategy of small attacks, each individual action making it impossible to regard it as an infringement of Poland's independence, but the aim is to squeeze Poland out of this free city without firing a shot, so as to achieve its wish. However, the Polish government has repeatedly declared that Poland cannot tolerate any infringement of its rights in Danzig, and British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech has had the effect of strengthening Poland's attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 1st] The political magazine "International Relations" wrote, "If Britain and France attempt to maintain the status quo in Danzig, a large-scale European war is almost unavoidable." In an unsigned commentary, believed to be instructed by others, a warning was issued to Britain and France that the military strength of the Axis powers would automatically act to prevent the democratic countries from interfering in the Danzig issue. At the same time, Italy will take this opportunity to satisfy its territorial and financial demands on France. The article also warned Turkey, advising it to stay out of Balkan affairs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British ambassador to Poland, Kenfylde, has returned to London by plane and will immediately meet with the Foreign Secretary. Today, after visiting the Foreign Office, Kenfylde had lunch at the Polish Embassy in Britain. News from Paris said that the French ambassador to Poland is currently in Paris and met with the Foreign Minister yesterday. Paris sources said that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has stated that Britain will fulfill its obligations to Poland and that Britain and France's attitude towards Danzig has not changed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British ambassador to Poland visited the Foreign Office again this morning and met with Foreign Secretary Halifax. After leaving the Foreign Office, he went to the Polish Embassy and had lunch with the Polish ambassador. In the next few days, the diplomatic representatives of Britain stationed in major capitals will gather in London. The British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, is also among them.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd] The British ambassador to Paris, Phelps, visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon. According to political sources, the French Foreign Minister will take advantage of the British ambassador's visit to communicate in detail the decisions made at the French ministerial meeting on Saturday.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Bonnet invited German Ambassador Weizsäcker to the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon to discuss the current situation. According to well-informed circles, the French Foreign Minister communicated the French cabinet's decision on the Danzig issue and the French ambassador's report from Warsaw on the Polish government's desire to deal with the reorganization of the Free City of Danzig.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd] Local newspapers reported news from Paris stating that French Foreign Minister Bonnet reiterated the French government's views on Danzig to the Polish ambassador again on Saturday, and stated that if the Polish government implements the maintenance of Danzig's sovereignty, it must obtain the full assistance of Britain and France. The Polish ambassador declared that if there is an attempt to annex Danzig to Germany, the Polish government will respond with force.</p>
<p>[London, 1st] Foreign News: If the rumors circulating in London at this time are believed to be true, Germany will have surprising new moves occur within this month or August. This may be the one that determines victory or defeat. It is expected that Germany, when it has reached its highest peak of its military power and effectiveness, will act immediately, and military experts believe that Germany can reach this highest peak this summer. In addition, there is another matter that is sufficient to make people angry, and a new crisis is imminent, that is, the tripartite military talks between the land, sea, and air forces of Germany and Italy have now been completed, and some observers also pointed out that the reorganization of the German and Italian armies according to the Axis plan will soon be completed. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler is currently planning to take action in Slovakia and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, because after the Nazi Party seized Slovakia, it can exert more effective pressure on other countries in the Danube River basin, and can use the excuse of "recovering lost territories" to prevent Hungary from interfering when Germany takes military action against Poland. However, some military experts believe that Germany's preparations for war on the borders of East Prussia and Slovakia cannot be completed in less than a few months. From this point of view, Germany's actual military actions against Poland will not begin until next spring. It is known that Germany currently lacks workers and materials to build defensive battles, which greatly reduces Germany's chances of victory, because Poland has thus gained sufficient time to build its defense lines.</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Resist Aggression; Sinclair Advocates Government Reorganization; Belkin Speech to Defend Small Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Sir Sinclair, leader of the [party name missing] Party, stated today that anyone who seeks to force Britain or countries that have accepted British guarantees to fight will find that there are no defeatists in our country, that our armaments are sharp and that our sources are inexhaustible, and that the initiator will encounter our strong resistance and cannot hope that we will willingly submit to the violence of aggression. Sinclair said that the Munich Agreement only made peace more difficult, so cooperation with the Soviet Union is urgently needed. Sinclair concluded by advocating government reorganization and inviting Churchill and Eden to take key positions in the cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Supply Minister Belkin said in a speech at a government banquet today, "A very small number of people, out of the world's 2 billion people, want to monopolize the entire civilized world in 1939, but the whole world has refused to accept this attitude. The entire British nation and empire have united with the United States to form a vast group of public opinion, and many small countries are united with Britain and the United States. These small countries all hope not to be interfered with by the outside world. We have reorganized our armaments, not only to protect ourselves (anyone who tries to attack Britain will sign their death sentence), but also because small countries find that gentle words still fail to prevent being destroyed and annexed." When [he] discussed the peace group being called [policy name missing] policy, [he] said, "I would like to make clear to every man and woman in Germany that Britain is Germany's man, but no insane country can recognize that the empire is a mature orchard that can be picked at will. We have the world's most powerful navy, and the air force has developed beyond imagination, and we have a rigorously trained and mechanized army, all equipped with the latest weapons. What we are most pleased with is the outstanding spirit of the people, not afraid of threats, determined to pursue peace, but this also has a certain limit."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Sir Cripps said in a speech today, "We will never tolerate being ruled by others, or losing our freedom, and being subject to others. If anyone attempts to do so, we are prepared to rise up and defend, and will collect all resources and unite with allied countries to fight to the end. Today, no one doubts that the war crisis will erupt within three months. No matter how terrible the future situation is, most of the people of our country are prepared to fight for what they love and are willing to sacrifice."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The responsible authorities, agencies, and newspapers in Britain, under the leadership of the government, have successively warned Germany not to recklessly invade other countries. The speeches of the authorities and the editorials of the newspapers all stated that Britain has reorganized its armaments and is determined to fight decisively when necessary, and that the whole country should unite to deal with the situation with a firm attitude. All this is to make the German side understand Britain's determination to fight, so that Europe may not be caused a major war because of the Danzig issue. According to unconfirmed news, the government intends to expand the range of conscription ages. It is also said that the British fleet is prepared to move out at any time, and as for the expansion of the British air force, those who have seen it should also marvel at it as a miracle. The air force is scheduled to hold exercises on the 8th of this month, and the scale of it will create an unprecedented record in history.</p>
<h3>Serious International Situation: France Prepares Large Sums for Military Expansion; General Gamelin Cancels Trip to North Africa</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Today, French Premier Daladier reported to the cabinet meeting that the international situation "remains extremely serious." A Polish government spokesperson stated that Poland has begun to take countermeasures to address the Nazi Party's agitation towards Danzig. Poland is "closely monitoring" the recent developments in Danzig and will deal with the Nazi Party's actions with appropriate measures. Although the Nazi Party has engaged in various provocative actions in Danzig recently, Poland has no intention of causing conflict. However, in view of the fact that German stormtroopers are secretly infiltrating Danzig, Poland is also sending young people to disrupt the situation. Today, Polish people began to move into Danzig. It is widely rumored in London and Paris that the Nazi Party will launch an attack this weekend, but this has not been officially confirmed. A diplomatic correspondent for the London "Times" commented on this matter, and his opinion can be regarded as semi-official. The newspaper stated that Germany's actions are a deliberate attempt to trap Poland in the position of aggressor. Various newspapers stated that Britain and Poland believe that any military action, whether it occurs inside or outside the free city, constitutes an act of war. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the British Foreign Secretary is staying in London for the weekend to monitor all developments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] The cabinet held a state council meeting this morning to discuss the current situation in Europe. Premier Daladier first presented a report, stating that the situation in Europe is indeed very serious. Immediately afterwards, it was decided to take various measures to strengthen the country's power, so as to dispel any doubts about France's strong determination. The most important measures include two items: (1) In addition to the national defense bonds issued in April of this year for 15,000,000,000 francs, an additional 4,400,000,000 francs will be raised to accelerate the expansion of military equipment. (2) The terms of the wartime national organization of France will be expanded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] General Gamelin, the Chief of the General Staff of National Defense, originally planned to visit Corsica Island in the Mediterranean Sea to inspect defense, but this has now been cancelled. It is believed by some that this is due to the renewed tension in the European situation.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, Paris, 2nd] French Premier Daladier, Interior Minister Sarraut, Justice Minister Marchandeau, and Paris Prefect Langeron held a meeting at the Ministry of War yesterday. According to informed sources, the main issue of this meeting was the handling of foreigners residing in France during wartime.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Franco-Soviet Negotiations Proceeding Smoothly: Soviet Union Considers New Anglo-French Proposals; Hopeful for Successful Conclusion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] The British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union and the British government special envoy Strang jointly visited the Soviet Foreign Minister and Deputy Minister today for a two-hour meeting. Afterwards, Strang stated that the Soviet government is currently considering the final proposal of the Anglo-French agreement and that another meeting will be held soon. This morning, French Foreign Minister Bonnet presented the original text of the Anglo-French proposals recently submitted to the Soviet Union for review at the Paris State Council meeting. According to official sources, Bonnet reported to the State Council that the negotiations are progressing very smoothly. Bonnet visited the Soviet Ambassador to France this morning. Premier Daladier reported to the State Council on the steps taken to clarify French objectives and also reported on the laws regarding national defense preparations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] French diplomatic figures are extremely optimistic about the future of the Moscow negotiations and firmly believe that the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks have reached a stage where they can be concluded quickly and successfully.</p>
<p>[London, 1st] Foreign news: A well-known political correspondent stated that a gentlemanly war is currently taking place within the British Chamberlain cabinet. The two sides are Foreign Secretary Halifax on one side and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and Interior Minister Hoare on the other. Simon and Hoare are strongly opposed to the Anglo-Soviet agreement, while Halifax is the main proponent of this agreement. It is said that the frustration caused by the guarantee of Poland's sea issues has made Halifax's side feel quite satisfied, but Halifax remains extremely vigilant and has no doubts.</p>
<h3>US Senate Discusses Currency Act; Senators Employ Delaying Tactics</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The compromise plan passed by the joint conference of the House and Senate on the currency issue (deciding to restore the government's power to purchase silver from abroad and change the gold content of the US dollar) was submitted to the Senate for discussion on the afternoon of the 30th. Senator Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland, first adopted delaying tactics, delivering a long speech explaining his reasons for opposing it. Then, Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, also opposed submitting the compromise plan to a vote using the same tactics. His speech was incessant until midnight, when the current currency expired, before he finished speaking. Therefore, the government authorities will inevitably have to submit a new bill to the House and Senate to remedy the situation. Observers have issued arguments on the results of last night's Senate discussion, saying that after this year, the president will have no power to adjust the gold content of the US dollar, and the $200 million stabilization fund has no legal basis. The government's purchase of silver from abroad has no fixed price and should be based on the world market price. Only the 1934 Silver Purchase Act is still valid, and the Ministry of Finance can still purchase silver as needed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] The joint conference of the House and Senate passed a compromise plan last night, stipulating that (1) President Roosevelt still has the power to change the gold content of the US dollar and purchase foreign silver; (2) the Exchange Stabilization Fund can continue to be maintained (the total amount of the fund is $200 million); (3) the domestic silver purchase price is set at 70 cents per ounce. The House of Representatives passed the bill today by a vote of 229 to 160 and immediately transferred it to the Senate for discussion. However, opposition senators in the Senate still sought to obstruct it, intending to use delaying tactics to prevent the compromise plan from being submitted to a vote before midnight today. Republican Senators Townsend, Vandenberg, Taft, and Democratic Senators Adams and O'Mahoney all intended to deliver lengthy speeches at the meeting to consume time. Senator Hall, an opponent of the bill, told a Havas reporter that he would speak for at least two or three hours. According to their strategy, even if successful, the government can still continue to purchase silver from abroad because the House of Representatives has already passed it.</p>
<h3>British Labour Congress Issues Declaration Appealing to Germans for Peace; Britain Determined Not to Yield to Threats of Force; Only Peaceful Cooperation Can Build Happiness</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British National Labour Congress, representing trade unions and the Labour Party, has drafted a declaration appealing to the German people and urging labor personnel around the world to insist that all disputes must be resolved by reason rather than war. The declaration begins, "Why kill each other?" and then questions who is responsible for the current situation. It then appeals to the German people, saying, "Some of you may say that Germany has been surrounded by its enemies and that they are trying to destroy your country and make it impossible for the German people's economic life to continue. Therefore, European peace is threatened. This statement is a blatant lie, and your propaganda minister knows it. It is true that many countries in Europe have united with each other to seek self-defense. The British Labour Party has promoted this policy to the government, not to harm Germany, but to prevent the success of aggression and thereby preserve world peace. All the events that led to the tragic annexation of Czechoslovakia have convinced us that your government's aim is nothing more than to dominate all of Europe and enslave humanity. Now, similar war preparations are underway. Your government is currently engaging in false propaganda and disruptive agitation in an attempt to strike at Poland. You should understand the facts, because if this situation continues, the result will be war... From our point of view, butter is better than cannons. What we cannot tolerate is that our freedom, peace, and security cannot be threatened by the selfishness of dictators. We must not continue to appease dictators by yielding to threats of force. Only peaceful cooperation can build a world of happiness, security, and development. We not only have no intention of surrounding your country and then destroying it; on the contrary, we sincerely welcome you to join this circle."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Reuters has learned that the British Labour Congress's message to the German people will be broadcast by a secret radio station, and it is said that it will be relayed by all German underground organizations (it is rumored that Germany has such organizations). The Labour Congress has done everything possible to ensure that the message can reach at least some German workers, and it hopes that the workers who receive the message can spread it by word of mouth.</p>
<h3>India Agrees to Send Representatives to Washington to Attend Cotton Export Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Simla, 2nd] The Indian government has said it has accepted an invitation to send representatives to Washington to attend a conference of cotton exporting countries to discuss the possibility of establishing a world cotton agreement.</p>
<h3>Italian Military Aircraft Collide During Exercise</h3>
<p>(Haitong Press, Rome, 2nd) Two Italian military aircraft suddenly collided yesterday while practicing in the sky near Viterbo. Both planes crashed and were completely destroyed, killing all five people on board.</p>
<h3>Actively Increasing Aircraft Production: Minister of Aviation Delivers Speech; Weekly Expenditure of Two Million Pounds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Minister of Aviation Wood delivered a speech in Leamington yesterday, providing a very detailed account of the large-scale expansion of the British Air Force. He said that although the figures for the increase in British aircraft are military secrets and cannot be disclosed, he can tell everyone that the government's expenditure on manufacturing aircraft is 2 million pounds per week. From this figure, it is not difficult to know how Britain is increasing the number of aircraft. The government has formulated a plan to rapidly increase the production of aircraft in large quantities. This will have a very large impact in wartime.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Mutual Assistance Agreement Between Egypt and Turkey; Italy Feels Uneasy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, August 30th] Regarding the rumor that Egypt and Turkey are about to sign a mutual assistance agreement, the Telegrafo newspaper (Foreign Minister Ciano's mouthpiece) recently commented on it, clearly indicating that if this agreement is established, Italy will have to increase its troops in its North African territory of Libya in response. In addition, the Fascist Party feels uneasy about Turkey joining the Anglo-French guarantee front. This sentiment is expressed by the Telegrafo, which states that after the outbreak of war, Turkey will inevitably send troops to Egypt to help defend the security of the Suez Canal. This borders Italian territory and Egypt, and will be a very serious threat. Therefore, if the Turkish-Egyptian mutual assistance agreement is declared under the auspices of Britain and France, the Italian government will sooner or later send an important note to the British ambassador, informing him that the Anglo-Italian agreement of April-June 1938 had a provision for the exchange of military intelligence between the two countries and urging him to pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>German Army and Air Force Suddenly Parade and Perform; Residents of Berlin Alarmed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 2nd] Yesterday, motorized units of the army suddenly paraded on the main roads here, and aircraft performed aerial displays, causing great alarm among the residents of the city.</p>
<h3>Japan Registers Private Gold; Foreign Residents Also Subject to This Restriction</h3>
<p>[Haitong Press, Tokyo, 1st] Japan is currently conducting a registration of privately owned cash. The registration began today. The purpose of this move is to ascertain the total amount of gold remaining in private hands, so that it can be sold to the government. Foreigners in Japan are also required to register their gold, but they are not forced to hand it over to the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Fleets; Germany Launches Another New Ship</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] In addition to the Soviet fleet conducting exercises in the Black Sea and near Vladivostok, the German and Italian navies are also conducting exercises on foreign seas. Several German destroyers will conduct exercises off the Norwegian coast for three weeks. Four Italian ships, including a 23,000-ton battleship and eight 10,000-ton cruisers, are scheduled to visit the port of Tangier in northwestern Africa on Sunday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Germany's fifth 10,000-ton cruiser built after the war was launched today in the port of Bremen. It was initially expected that Hitler would attend the launch ceremony, but he remained in his retreat in Obersalzberg. Therefore, this launch ceremony became "non-political." The ceremony was presided over by German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, Bremen, 2nd] Yesterday, Germany's newest 10,000-ton heavy cruiser, the "Lützow," was launched at the Weser Shipyard here. German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder personally attended the ceremony. The naming ceremony was presided over by Mrs. Olders, the wife of the captain of the Lützow, a German ship that was sunk by its own crew during the European War. Commander-in-Chief Raeder also presided over the opening ceremony of the Hitler Bridge over the Weser River on the same day.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>×××× Britain</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Incident, Tokyo Negotiations, the Danzig Question... From the Far East to Northern Europe, the demands of the aggressors are all closing in on ××××!</p>
<p>The Tianjin Incident concerns the survival of Britain's entire Far Eastern interests. At the Tokyo negotiations, to be held on the 6th of this month, Britain will certainly not accept any topic in which Japan involves its "New Order" in East Asia. Even less can it consider Tokyo as a Munich. It can only attempt to seek a compromise in the so-called local and partial issues. However, such a compromise will only increase Japan's arrogance and make future troubles even more serious.</p>
<p>As for the Danzig Question, Hitler is determined to get it, and Mussolini is now also coming out to extort. On the one hand, this is the "taking advantage of danger and plunder" by the European aggressors, and on the other hand, it is also supporting Japan's extortion and robbery in the East. Regarding the Danzig Question, Foreign Secretary Halifax has already made a "resistance," but Britain and France's own power to guarantee Poland is highly doubtful without the assistance of the Soviet Union. Then, the result of this "toughness" will not be much better than the result of his "concessions" in the Far East.</p>
<p>Where is Britain, under siege, going?</p>
<p>The path to survival is clear. The British people have seen it clearly, and the British government has not failed to have its own opinions. That is to establish a road of opposing aggressive red lines. In the Far East, it must actively support China, which has the same interests and has been resisting strategically for two years. In Europe, it must quickly abandon the "wishful thinking" of the already shrinking "transforming Hitler's path" and accelerate the completion of the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement.</p>
<p>Today's news reports that British diplomacy will have new activities and that ambassadors stationed abroad will be summoned to a meeting. We expect this to be a manifestation of taking the road to survival!</p>

<h3>The German Emperor's Mistake: One Misstep, Eternal Regret</h3>
<p>Mr. Adolf Hitler, long time no see. Lately, you seem to be a little on edge, wanting to stir things up. Good, anyway, Britain has the navy, France has the air force, the Soviet Union has the army, the United States has the money; and we Chinese have a Great Wall of 450 million flesh and blood. Whatever you want to play, we will have to accompany you.</p>
<p>However, we are a land of propriety and righteousness, so we must first be polite before resorting to arms. Let us remind you: do you still remember the humiliation of the 1918 defeat? Although you blame the Jews for this failure—regardless of whether you say there were too many British and Jewish officers or too few German Jewish officers—General Ludendorff blamed it on the German people not being resilient enough—naturally, he had nothing to do with people starving—; your backstage boss, Mr. Losson, attributed this failure to Germany not having enough money—of course, the marks in his own pocket are another matter—. But what we see is also a reason for the failure: that was the mistake made by your Great Emperor, Wilhelm II. One misstep led to such eternal regret. Let me tell you, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Friend, please turn to your domestic history textbooks. Back in 1904, King Leopold II of Belgium came to Berlin to pay his respects; your Emperor Wilhelm invited him to review the troops.</p>
<p>"I am really not interested in these; I think money is the key to everything." The Belgian king said during the military review. Leopold II was then one of the richest people in the world. The Congo Free State, four times the size of France and eighty-four times the size of Belgium itself, was his private property, from which he could earn 3,300,000 francs annually.</p>
<p>This is what harmed your Emperor Wilhelm. On the evening before Leopold was about to bid farewell, Wilhelm II told him that in the near future, a Franco-German war would be unavoidable. At that time, if Belgium could not remain neutral and instead fight with Germany, Germany would be willing to give Luxembourg and Limburg to Leopold as trinkets.</p>
<p>Money is the key to everything! After returning to Brussels, Leopold II actually started training troops, preparing to take over Luxembourg and Limburg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, heaven did not grant him many years. On December 17, 1909, Leopold II passed away; he had trained 42,800 soldiers, but he never saw the two fertile lands.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM on August 2, 1914, a German ultimatum was sent to Belgium, requesting permission for German troops to pass freely through Belgian territory to France. Wilhelm II thought that the current Belgian King Albert was Leopold II's nephew, born in Saxon-Coburg, Germany; Queen Elizabeth was from Bavaria, Germany; with such kinship and friendship, letting them pass should not be a problem. So, he sent a telegram to King Albert in his personal capacity, asking for mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>This telegram arrived at the Louvain Palace on the morning of August 4. Wilhelm II never expected that King Albert would be furious, considering this telegram a great insult to him. Immediately, he ordered his 42,800 troops to go to the border and automatically blow up all the roads and bridges.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth, a true German, looked at the telegram from Wilhelm II and the German ultimatum again and again, reading it without missing a single word. Then, on the back of the telegram, she wrote a reply in fluent German: "Cannot comply with your request." Similarly, a telegram had already been sent to Paris. Five hours later, four German divisions had begun to rush into the Belgian border.</p>
<p>However, Belgium had already had troops and had made preparations, and under extremely difficult circumstances, it held out for two weeks, allowing France to take all necessary measures. Wilhelm II's dream of reaching Paris in three days never came true, and the dream of conquering the world became a bubble!</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler, this should be a lesson for you!</p>
<p>Okay, Mr. Adolf Hitler, we'll see you again in Tannenberg! Because, I'm afraid that's where your grave will be!</p>
<h3>One Person Per Day</h3>
<p>George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>This self-proclaimed king of humor, Bernard Shaw, when he had not yet made his fortune, worked in a small newspaper office in London, writing drama reviews to make a living.</p>
<p>The old Shaw was indeed quite picky, so many of the performers at the time were not on good terms with him.</p>
<p>Once in a hotel, he criticized a famous actor and got into an argument. The famous actor was a master of playing heroes, and immediately struck a pose and threw a card at the old Shaw before walking away with his head held high.</p>
<p>This meant that he was asking the old Shaw to set a time and place for a duel. Although the old Shaw was not old at the time, he was so skinny that he was all bones. How could he be the opponent of that great hero? But he had no choice but to take the card.</p>
<p>In the evening, he added a line to the card: "Please allow the bearer to enter." So, he watched a free show, and after watching it, he ran backstage and said to the famous actor: "Thank you for your card. I watched a free show, and I will definitely write you a good review tomorrow."</p>
<h3>Aphorisms</h3>
<p>There are three kinds of animals in the world that seem to be coming but are actually going, and seem to be leaving but are coming again: diplomats, women, and crabs. —John Hann</p>
<p>A suspicion that lasts for a long time and remains unresolved will become an immortal truth.</p>
<p>— H.L. Mencken</p>
<p>I would rather live in a country with newspapers and no laws than in a country with laws and no newspapers. — Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States</p>
<p>Fools are afraid of committing crimes, we are only afraid of being poor. — George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>One can only deceive the majority of people for a short time, or deceive a minority of people for a long time, but one can never deceive all of the people all of the time.</p>
<p>— Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>So That's How It Is</p>
<h3>Weather Station</h3>
<p>This is still a capitalist world, where money is naturally all-powerful. The news colleagues in Shanghai are falling into money's traps, one after another. Those so-called advancing yellow-haired and blue-eyed "friends of China" still cannot escape the temptation of money. What about Hong Kong? Has anyone sold their conscience and soul for a few dollars?</p>
<p>Europe seems to be very tense again, but July 1st passed peacefully. We are very surprised that old Hitler has calculated this weekend. But, do you think he's stupid? He'll fight with someone? That would be strange.</p>
<p>However, we have to say, Hong Kong is also preparing gas masks. I wonder if it's preparing to defend against poison gas from the East? Or from which side? However, there are many more things that Hong Kong needs to defend against!</p>
<h3>Lin Xi Zhao's Most Effective Curse</h3>
<p>In 1849, a revolution occurred in Hungary with the goal of overthrowing the Habsburg royal family. As a result, the revolution failed, and the leaders of the rebels were killed by the government. The Hungarian Prime Minister Batthyány was also innocently killed.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister's mother heard the news of her beloved son's wrongful death, she was filled with grief and anger and could not help but break out cursing the emperor. She said, "May he and his descendants never die a good death!" This sentence turned out to be very effective and is historically known as "the curse of the Habsburg royal family."</p>
<p>After the Hungarian Emperor was cursed in this way, his son committed suicide, his wife was assassinated, one brother was executed, another brother was murdered by an enemy, one sister-in-law was burned to death, another sister-in-law went mad, his niece died in a fire, his nephew died in an accident, another nephew drowned, and another nephew was assassinated in Sarajevo, sparking World War I. The emperor himself also died during World War I, and the empire collapsed.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>The people of the two great capitals, England and America, clearly think differently. If you don't believe it, look:</p>
<p>New Yorkers think:</p>
<p>(1) Can a showgirl make a good wife?</p>
<p>(2) Is red hair a symbol of gentleness?</p>
<p>(3) Can a woman be in love with two men?</p>
<p>(4) Is obesity a sign of genius?</p>
<p>Londoners think:</p>
<p>(1) Can a showgirl marriage have good results?</p>
<p>(2) What does red hair symbolize?</p>
<p>(3) Can a man be in love with two women?</p>
<p>(4) Is genius a sign of obesity?</p>
<h3>Sea Adventures 22</h3>
<p>— By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous Summary: In the autumn of 1914, Jack, a radio operator for the Hawkes Shipping Company, and Bill, a mechanic, took a trip to Europe on the German ship "Käperonchi". Because England and Germany declared war, British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship frantically fled. With great difficulty, it escaped the jaws of the tiger and returned to the American waters of the White Sea. Jack and Bill went back to New York to see Mr. Hawkes. Hawkes then told them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson...</p>
<p>At dinnertime, Mullen, the original radio operator on the "Saint Mark," arrived, and Jack went off duty. That night, he was free, so he spent his time reading a newly published radio textbook.</p>
<p>However, the day's labor had exhausted him, and he fell asleep in a chair behind a gas cylinder on the upper deck. Although, in this season, the weather was quite cool, and the few first-class passengers were all in the smoking room or the lounge.</p>
<p>Jack didn't know how long he had been asleep, but he woke up because someone was talking on the other side of the cylinder, disturbing him. One of the voices drilled into his ears, and he remembered that it was Professor Johnson.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for that little beast in the radio room," Johnson said, "the news would have reached Von Stohlen long ago."</p>
<p>"So you couldn't inform him about the British cruiser?" another person asked.</p>
<p>"No. I will. I'm going to see what that night operator is like. He might not be so suspicious and unreasonable, unless that little fellow from the daytime has already told him."</p>
<p>"Are you saying, Professor, that you knew him before?" the person asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, on the 'Käperonchi'. I was - I was trying to oversee the distribution of lifeboats because the British cruiser was chasing behind us, and everyone on board was extremely panicked. At that time, this little scoundrel actually beat me like a beast."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you report him to the captain?"</p>
<p>"But, you think that - that - that wouldn't seem very good."</p>
<p>"Got you, Professor Lavicky - now I know who you are, Mr. Johnson," Jack thought to himself. "No wonder, I thought, I recognized you, despite your disguise."</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do now?" Mr. Johnson's (or rather, Professor Lavicky's) companion asked.</p>
<p>"I need to see. Smith and Jones, do you understand radio?"</p>
<p>"I'm okay at it, what's your plan—?"</p>
<p>"Never mind that for now. It's a bit cold. Let's go back to the cabin. I want to talk to you a lot tomorrow."</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Fierce Tennis Match Under the Scorching Sun: Da Xu Wins Over Wang Wenzheng; Mixed Doubles Full of Laughter; Wang Withdraws from Doubles Due to Foot Injury</h3>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon, after watching baseball, I went from Jia Shan to the Chinese Recreation Club and saw the lawn in front of the clubhouse already arranged as a battlefield.</p>
<p>As the bell rang three times, the usual guests who loved to do good deeds arrived together, including the movie star Li Zhuozhuo. She watched both baseball and tennis, showing that she was very interested in sports.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun was like fire, scorching the skin painfully. The charity match organizers, considering the weather was too hot, postponed the start of the match by thirty minutes.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of three or four hundred spectators, the fierce battle between Wang Wenzheng and Xu Weipei unfolded. In the first set, the two players were closely matched, battling intensely for twenty-eight games, lasting over an hour, before a winner was determined. Wang took the lead with an 8-6 victory. The score was as follows:</p>
<p>Wang 1 6 1 4 5 3 3 2 4 4 0 4 5 4…8</p>
<p>Xu 4 4 4 1 3 5 5 4 2 1 4 2 3 0…6</p>
<p>This set, due to the "deuce" situation, saw constant shifts in momentum, making the situation extremely tense and full of highlights. Wang used a bold approach, frequently making long cross-court shots from the baseline, which was his strength. His force was indeed fierce. However, although Wang won this set, he was already suffering, having exerted all his strength, greatly depleting his energy. Therefore, he couldn't maintain it. Moreover, competing under the scorching sun, having already engaged in an excessive and intense struggle, was particularly inappropriate. Thus, Wang eventually failed.</p>
<p>Xu's performance featured both soft and hard shots, and he often scored points with well-placed drop shots. He also had a firm grip on net interception. Wang lost out in this aspect, sticking only to the baseline. Thus, Xu either didn't go to the net, or if he did, he was sure to score. Also, Wang hit more out-of-bounds shots in this set. Under these circumstances, his eventual victory was entirely due to his forceful attacks, making it difficult for Xu to defend against his baseline shots. However, winning with force is not as good as controlling with intelligence. Wang had already exerted too much force in this set, and eventually felt a lack of stamina. Therefore, he collapsed in the second set and ran out of techniques. Xu's victory was very easy. The score was as follows:</p>
<p>Xu 4 4 5 1 4 4 4…6</p>
<p>Wang 1 2 3 4 1 1 0…1</p>
<p>This set became a one-sided performance, with only Xu active, executing drop shots at will, as if water flowed into a prepared channel. On the other hand, Wang already showed signs of fatigue. Every time he faced Xu's drop shots, although he wanted to chase after them, he felt his strength was failing him, resulting in a resounding defeat of 1-6.</p>
<p>After completing the two sets, the two players took a short break, changed their sweat-soaked clothes, and then started the final battle. However, Wang's hard-hitting style ultimately couldn't match Xu's intelligence and versatility. Thus, in the third set, although Wang had once taken a 3-1 lead, Xu calmly responded, and after leveling the score, the situation immediately turned around, eventually securing the final victory. The third set score was as follows:</p>
<p>Xu 6 1 5 2 4 4 6 0 5…6</p>
<p>Wang 4 4 7 4 2 0 4 0 3…3</p>
<p>The general criticism after the match was that the scorching weather sufficiently affected the nerves and movements of both players. Therefore, heroes cannot be judged by temporary successes or failures. I agree with this statement. As for the skill aspect, Xu showed many tricks, seizing every opportunity to display his various strengths, such as net play, drop shots, waist-height shots, and backhand slices. These were all his signature moves, so he was able to use various techniques to win.</p>
<p>Wang's only special skill was his flat backhand shot, which had good angles and powerful force. However, apart from using it to control Xu, he was at a disadvantage in every other aspect, so he was often in a passive position. If he wanted to take the initiative, he had to use all his strength, which was not easy to achieve. However, dealing with Xu cannot be effective by merely using force. Therefore, the initiative Wang gained through force was only in the first set, and he was at a disadvantage afterwards.</p>
<p>The second match was a mixed doubles match between Ling Daoyang who was absent, and the veteran Liu Fucheng partnered with Mrs. Zhao Xiaozhao, facing Diao Zuoqian and Ms. Yang Weibin, putting on many humorous moments, making the spectators laugh non-stop, forgetting the hardship of the scorching sun. As a result, the Liu Zhao team won with two scores of 6-4.</p>
<p>The third match was also doubles, originally with Wang Wenzheng partnering with Kobayashi Chin, facing the Xu brothers. However, Wang was very tired from playing in the singles match, and his foot cramped afterwards, preventing him from appearing again. Therefore, Situ Bi partnered with Xu Weipei, facing Xu Runpei and Kobayashi Chin, making it quite a spectacle, full of fun. The result was as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Runpei Kobayashi Chin Win Xu Weipei Situ Bi 6-4 7-5</p>
<p>Amitabha, another good deed is completed. Tickets and raffle tickets totaled $292, not including advance sales. One of the raffle prizes was won by Li Huitang's colleague, Liang Zao Ru, who won a Dunlop racket (the "Court Tyrant").</p>
<h3>Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Austin, Riggs, and Cooke All Win Yesterday, Entering the Semifinals Together</h3>

<h3>Public Baseball League: South China Team Fails at the Last Hurdle; Youbei Wins 9-8</h3>
<p>In the Hong Kong Open Baseball League, the Youbei team and the South China team faced off for the first time yesterday morning at 10:30. Youbei, considering South China's mediocre record, didn't take it seriously. Unexpectedly, South China displayed great power, restraining Youbei during the first inning's defense. Therefore, Youbei only scored one point when Sousa scored, ending the inning. When it was South China's turn to counterattack, Deji, Leonard, and Pete all made mistakes in a row, allowing Wu Zhenbang, Zheng Kangyong, Chen Yutian, and He Xiancheng to run back to home base, scoring a total of four points. Huang Yaozong's triple was the most meritorious. In the next two innings, Youbei was frustrated. The fourth inning didn't improve, scoring only one point. When it was South China's turn to counterattack, Youbei changed its formation, with Xia Gaoli taking the center fielder position and Leonard as the pitcher. South China didn't take it seriously and continued to work hard. Tang Rongguang hit the ball and safely reached first base, showing great promise. Unfortunately, Wu Zhenbang, who followed him, didn't hit hard but used a bunt, trapping himself and being tagged out by Xia Gaoli, who threw the ball to Leonard. The audience said that Wu made a needless sacrifice. Then Zheng Kangyong hit a fly ball, and Pete missed it, allowing Zheng to reach first base. But at this time, Tang Rongguang had already stolen home base, scoring one point. Chen Yutian, seeing the opponent's confusion, tried to steal second base but was tagged out by the pitcher and third baseman. Finally, He Xiancheng hit the ball not far, and was tagged out, ending the attack. In the fifth inning, Youbei scored four points with Sousa, Pete, Leonard, and Xia Gaoli. During South China's counterattack, Huang Yaozong's high ball was caught. Situ Bi got a hit, and Chen Zhendong took advantage of Omar's mistake to get to first base, sending Situ Bi to second base, creating a good "bases loaded" situation. At this time, pitcher Leonard was overwhelmed, throwing four balls, allowing Kangyong to reach second base and Situ Bi to return to home base, scoring one point. Until Chen Yutian hit a high ball, which Ali caught, Youbei's encirclement was relieved. In the sixth inning, Youbei scored two more points with Omar and Sousa, reversing the score to 9-8. In the seventh inning, neither team scored, and Youbei declared victory.</p>
<p>Overall, South China was still winning 8-7 until the fifth inning, making Youbei feel difficult to cope with. South China's performance in this battle can be described as heroic. Unfortunately, South China lacked experience and could attack but not defend, leading to defeat. Catcher He Xiancheng intercepted stealing players and threw the ball too often, creating opportunities for the opponent to advance. Pitcher Zheng Kangyong was skilled at handling the bat and very active in attack, but in defense, he often didn't know the situation and missed a double play opportunity. These factors were the main reasons for South China's defeat. However, Youbei's talent was indeed superior to South China's. South China was able to fight so hard, creating this tense situation, which was truly remarkable. Here are the scores of both teams:</p>
<p>Youbei 1 1 1 0 4 2 0 9</p>

<h3>On "Tactics" in the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Tu Lao</p>
<p>Recently, a certain bookstore published a book specializing in the skills of lawyers. I only saw the advertisement in the newspaper, which said that the book "compiles the great achievements of lawyers' tactics and is sufficient to assist literary writers."</p>
<p>This seems a bit strange, so I couldn't help but think about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of lawyers, in past societies they were indeed a class that lived by "tactics." Their tactics were not only used in lawsuits, that is, using texts to frame and slander, but also in practical planning. They could bribe officials, collude with gangsters, fabricate evidence, spread rumors, and do other even more terrible things.</p>
<p>However, since the advertisement says it is "sufficient to assist literary writers," the book naturally only talks about "tactics" in terms of writing. There have been special books on this aspect before, but they generally do not reveal the "key" to tactics. This is still the old problem of the Chinese, everything must be "secret" to be suitable. However, generally speaking, the key is nothing more than two extremes: first, giving people nicknames, and second, talking about "motives" when things happen.</p>
<p>A nickname is what is called a "derisive name." The method is: before writing out the crimes of the person being accused, first give the name a nickname, such as "Giant-Eyed Tyrant" or "Big-Headed Overlord," meaning that officials, upon seeing the name, would immediately determine that he is not a good person. "Motive" is a modern term, and the previous term was called "intent." The method is: if the person being accused has two well-known good deeds, say that his intention was to seek fame or profit. In short, the advantages are also disadvantages, or even worse than the bad things that are easy to see. This trick is often used when counter-accusations are made.</p>
<p>But now the question is, what use are these "tactics" to "literary writers"?—In fact, in my opinion, the person who compiled the book really wasted his thoughts. Some of our literary writers have already learned these "tactics."</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, you might as well check the old and new accounts in the literary world. "Nickname studies" have been popular for a period of time, and "intentional studies" have been popular all along, and have not declined until now. And the most common thing is that when one is criticized to the point of being at a dead end, one suddenly becomes an X-ray, saying that one can see the "motives" of the critic. This is exactly the trick of counter-accusation.</p>
<p>However, judging from experience, this kind of lawyer's writing style really cannot "help" "literary writers." Although "nickname studies" have been popular, they have disappeared without a trace. The reason is: since you have hung up the sign of "literary writer," you always have to take care of a bit of "literary" face, and you are unwilling to give the other party nicknames like "Giant-Eyed Tyrant" or "Big-Headed Overlord," and in fact the other party is also a literary writer, and it is impossible to be so bad as to become a "tyrant" or "overlord," so the nicknames given can only be limited to "individualist" or "pessimist." But this is really too broad, and the recipient has not felt any attack, and the listener feels very ordinary, so writing it out is the end, and no effect is obtained at all. "Intentional studies" have been maintained for a relatively long time, but in the end, attention is still paid to the text. Because since you are a writer, the main thing is of course the text, and everyone only looks at whether the critic's criticism of your text is correct. How the intention is is ultimately difficult to grasp, and there is really no need to care about such a trivial matter. Moreover, this remark will also make oneself lose face, and let others suspect that your gender is different from the critic's, and that you once asked the critic for something and did not achieve your goal, so you came to "retaliate" - this is called deceiving yourself.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how brilliant the lawyer's writing style is, literary writers really cannot benefit from it.</p>
<p>As for the actual "tactics" outside of writing, some of our literary writers are very limited. The reason is very simple: the literary world is not a yamen after all. After all the messing around, it will always be exposed in the end.</p>
<p>By rejecting lawyer-style "tactics," literary writers may have some hope.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage to Zhabei, Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>Zhabei, located within the sight of the foreign concessions in Shanghai, once densely populated by millions, but now strewn with scorched wood and dilapidated walls, fell on October 27th, a few days before our troops abandoned the Shanghai area two years ago. Counting on my fingers, the Japanese side has occupied the area for nineteen months. Logically speaking, they could have implemented their ambitious and widely publicized plans for improved municipal administration and economic development.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I returned to Zhabei and lingered for several hours. The scene that came into view was even more depressing than what I had seen on my last visit to Zhabei on a gloomy winter day two years ago. At that time, the part of the public concession occupied by the Japanese army and Zhabei were almost indistinguishable from each other, because both areas were desolate and permeated with the breath of death; now, however, the noisy bustle of the public concession and the deathly silence of Zhabei have become a sharp contrast.</p>
<p>In the nineteen months since the fall of Zhabei, the Japanese side has not begun to change its scarred face. The shell craters of the time still dotted the rubble-strewn streets, and the walls riddled with machine gun fire still stood by the roadside, teetering. The Chinese army's fortress still existed, but the sandbags were slightly damaged, and looking through the half-closed doors of the shops, one could see straight to the street.</p>
<p>The factory of the Commercial Press, worth millions of dollars, had one wall leaning out toward the neighboring trench. The factory was surrounded by barbed wire, and the tank trap in front had been filled in so that military trucks could occasionally pass by. Baoshan Road, which was prosperous and crowded with pedestrians two years ago, reminded people of a ghost market. However, the roadsides of the ghost market do not have bomb craters.</p>
<p>The North Railway Station, which was destroyed twice by the Japanese invaders in five years, has been rebuilt, but the eyes of foreigners cannot see its mystery, because now it is surrounded by high cement walls, electrified fences, and barbed wire obstacles. Facing the public concession, there is also a brand new cement underground fortress, which is used to prevent unexpected events. Only one entrance is left for entering and leaving the North Station. Japanese military police with stern faces stood there, carefully watching the Chinese people who were boarding the train in a panic.</p>
<p>I thought back to the previous October, when I looked at the North Station from a broken house on the concession side of the boundary road, only seeing Japanese planes lazily circling in the sky over Zhabei, dropping huge bombs. Below were Chinese soldiers wearing conical straw hats, perhaps reinforcements from Guangxi, because they were so close that I could see the features on each of their faces; every time a plane dropped a bomb, they would lie flat on the ground. In an instant, there was a loud bang, deafening, and pieces of wood and dust flew up. After the bombs exploded, these soldiers immediately continued their duties calmly, as if nothing had happened. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Road of Sinners</h3>
<p>— Yan Qi</p>
<p>When this lamp goes out, there is another lamp,</p>
<p>If this road doesn't work, just stay,</p>
<p>I don't believe there is anyone in the world who doesn't drink sweet wine,</p>
<p>Broken carriage, broken spear, broken bow, are also the sound of horns.</p>
<p>Yesterday, today, tomorrow, going out and coming in until sunset,</p>
<p>The blue arrow points the way, embarking on a new journey again.</p>
<p>The past fate is always a book of repentance,</p>
<p>Hymns, blessings, sacred flowers, a few city towers.</p>
<h3>The Creative Direction of Chinese Literature</h3>
<p>— Rujie</p>
<p>Today, the most important and fundamental issue standing in the way of the creation of Chinese literature is not the lowering of literary standards to suit the masses, nor is it raising the level of the masses' literary taste. Rather, it is the question of the overall creative direction of Chinese literature. If we propose "lowering" literary standards to suit the masses in isolation, then the problem is obviously simplified and reduced to a triviality. The most important central task of our literary movement today is, of course, to massively absorb the masses and win over the masses. However, absorbing the masses and winning over the masses cannot be achieved solely by "lowering" literary standards. Standing before the work of absorbing the masses and winning over the masses is precisely the question of the overall creative direction of Chinese literature. "Lowering" literary standards obviously cannot be considered the entirety of this work, but only one aspect of it. Although the work of this aspect cannot be said to be unimportant, it would undoubtedly be a mistake to overshadow the whole with this one aspect alone.</p>
<p>At the same time, if we propose raising the level of the masses in isolation, it is undoubtedly also a trivial matter. We know that the issue of raising the cultural level of the masses is not solely a literary issue, nor can it be achieved solely by work in the field of literature. This issue of "raising" is an issue of the entire social and cultural movement, a task of the entire cultural movement. Although the literary movement, as one aspect of the entire cultural movement, should also do its best in this work, it is quite clear that the work of raising the level of the masses is not its own unique task. Although literature inherently possesses common characteristics of the general cultural movement, the embodiment of these characteristics in literature must pass through its own special essence. The work of raising the level of the masses is also like this; its embodiment in literature must first pass through the characteristics of literature. That is to say, it must first become an organic aspect of the direction of literary creation in order to be concretized through the characteristics of literature. Therefore, it would undoubtedly be a mistake if this issue is not raised from the perspective of understanding the overall creative direction of Chinese literature.</p>
<p>Today, the work of Chinese literature to win over the masses and absorb the masses is not a matter of "lowering standards" or "raising standards," but a matter of the new creation of the entire Chinese literature. We need some new literary styles, some new literary archetypes, some new literary techniques. In short, today we need a new and complete literary system, a new and concrete literary method. This new system and method is not simply about popularization and massification, but also contains a wide range of aspects. For example, Sinicization and realization, such as the absorption of literary traditions and the refinement of historical habits, are all things it contains. The confluence of these complex and vast aspects constitutes the overall new creative direction of today's Chinese literature. This new creative direction, due to its broad scope and the richness and superiority of its content, is sufficient to have the greatest power to absorb the broad masses and win over the broad masses. Because this creative direction requires critical absorption of all the characteristics of Chinese history, as well as active condensation of the entire essence of mass life, it can most thoroughly adapt to the masses, penetrate the masses, and be loved and understood by the masses, thereby completing its purpose of winning over the masses and absorbing the masses.</p>
<p>Our demand for a new creative direction in literature today is not only for today, but also for the future. Not only to exert the combat power of literature today to lead the masses and induce the masses' realistic struggle, to build our literature's task of struggle in the great national revolutionary war; but also to lay the foundation for our literature of tomorrow in the process of today's literary battle. We must, on the basis of the new direction of literary creation, specifically grasp the characteristics of our national history, extract the essence of our national revolution, critique the life of our nation, learn the struggle of our masses, and absorb the entire historical heritage of our literature, in order to build our literature of tomorrow and give our literature of tomorrow a prerequisite for its brilliant development. Therefore, today we not only demand the popularization of literature, but also a new creative direction in literature, to carry out a full-scale critique and integration from the accumulation of mass life, from the inner meaning of national history, from all the positive factors of Chinese language art, to establish a literary creative direction that can organically participate in the battle today and brilliantly develop and expand tomorrow.</p>
<p>The establishment of a new literary creative direction is an organic strengthening and effective improvement of Chinese literature. This is the inevitable path for Chinese literature to move towards a completely new and bright world, towards the brilliant and splendid throne of international literature. Here, it not only means the massification of Chinese literature, nor does it only mean the improvement of Chinese literary standards, but it is the unity of this massification and improvement. On the one hand, it is massified by its own Chinese characteristics and mass nature. On the other hand, it is also elevated in standards by the new creation of various literary institutions based on realistic foundations. Therefore, on the one hand, it is massified, it is "lowered," but at the same time, it is also for tomorrow, upward-looking, and "elevated."</p>
<p>The establishment of a new creative direction for Chinese literature should be one of our important tasks today. We must carry out this work, just as we must carry out the battle.</p>
<h3>I Must Awaken</h3>
<p>— Junbo</p>
<p>I am lonely, I live in a lonely dream every day. I am accustomed to using the pen of thought to depict a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>Dreams are my familiar companions, I have never been frustrated in a dream. When I feel melancholy, or a little depressed, then I will lock my breath in the deep valley of sweet dreams, and quietly wait for that gentle hand to wipe away the autumn on my heart.</p>
<p>Dreams are lonely; I have had many lonely dreams. Sometimes I feel tired after pain, then I might as well drink a glass of lonely wine. Watching the eaves drips, listening to the subtle wind sweeping over the maple tips in the courtyard, I begin to imagine many golden stories, and then fall into a lonely dream. I see my companions with the laughter of the past; maybe I can still touch the warmth I lost. No curses, no resentment; holding tightly the dream of memory, there is lonely joy in the dream.</p>
<p>Towards the vast horizon, calling out to the past years. My heart is heavy. Inadvertently waving my hand, borrowing the wings of the wild geese, I grope towards the road in my dream again. "There are no years in dreams," I laugh lonely again. The laugh is lonely, who accompanies it? Besides the water drips on the eaves, the subtle wind in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Then, I cried in pain. The heart that had been violated by dreams suddenly turned cold. Rubbing my eyes, I said: "Dreams are empty, isn't that just a vain illusion?"</p>
<p>Reaching out to embrace the vast world, I don't want to dream anymore, the melancholy after the dream will torture me. Quickly rush to the beacon of this reality, muster a strong spirit, and bathe in the wind and rain of the era.</p>
<p>Really, I want to wake up, and never pursue that golden lie again!</p>
<h3>Plunged Towards the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>— Still a story of a girl —</p>
<p>They stopped by a ditch. Some people walked further, but most people stopped at the distance they had walked.</p>
<p>The South was warm, the crops in the fields grew luxuriantly, and the fragrance of the earth rippled in the air. However, on everyone's face, there was a layer of fearful expression.</p>
<p>But everything was still calm, there was no sign of planes, and no sound of engines. The train didn't come, so they had to sit on the side of the field and wait.</p>
<p>"This is just an alarm, what's there to be afraid of!"</p>
<p>Jingwen opened the fruit basket, took out an orange and peeled it, saying as if she didn't care at all.</p>
<p>Qingzhi ignored her and just looked at an old woman crouching on the ground, trembling. Her hair was already white, and she was crouching there, as if waiting for the ground to crack open, allowing her to hide inside.</p>
<p>The young man walked over and helped her up from the ground, and said many things to her that she didn't understand. The old woman looked up at him as if listening to him, and sat on the ground. Her face was frighteningly wrinkled, and tears gathered on her many-wrinkled cheeks.</p>
<p>"Please don't laugh at her," the young man said to her as he walked over again: "She is from XX Market. Two days ago, her entire family was bombed, and only she escaped with her old life. She is going to the provincial capital to find her son." (The End)</p>

<h3>The Hong Kong Government Plans to Order 100,000 Gas Masks from Britain, to be Sold to the Public at $2.50 Each, to be Kept in Government Custody and Distributed for Use in Case of Emergency. The Storage Location May Borrow School Storerooms</h3>
<p>Mr. Spikins, the Air Defense Officer, announced yesterday that all air defense work in Hong Kong, such as the digging of shelters, fire extinguishers, the purchase of fire-fighting tools and rescue medicines, etc., are being actively promoted. The method of using gas masks is also being drafted by the Air Defense Equipment Office, and will be announced and implemented during the day. According to the opinion of the Office, it is believed that Hong Kong residents should purchase a mask each for use in case of emergency. In order to encourage residents to purchase and to take self-defense measures, the Office will issue slogans for wide publicity. However, since the population of Hong Kong has increased greatly, it is difficult to estimate the actual total population of Hong Kong, and it is also difficult to estimate the number of masks required. Therefore, the Hong Kong Government will first order 100,000 masks from Britain and ship them to Hong Kong. The cost and freight of each mask will be approximately HK$2.50. In the future, they will be sold at the price they were purchased at, in order to achieve universality. If the supply is insufficient at that time, more orders will be placed. Regarding the storage problem of the masks, the Office believes that it is appropriate for the government to keep them in custody at ordinary times, and distribute them for use in case of emergency. The storage location should be spread throughout the districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the best is to borrow the storerooms of various schools, and there must be cold storage equipment so that they will not be affected by the hot weather and can be stored for a long time.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Explaining and Amending the Chamber of Commerce Law, Overseas Organizations Can Adopt Flexible Methods, Dual Nationality is Also Not a Problem</h3>
<p>The local chamber of commerce received instructions yesterday from Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, explaining the main points of the National Government's implementation of the revised Chamber of Commerce Law, stating that overseas Chinese chambers of commerce are often not initiated and organized by trade associations, and even if there are trade associations, they are often independent of the chambers of commerce. According to Article 7 of the revised Chamber of Commerce Law, "If there are no trade associations or the number of trade associations is less than three, companies without trade associations may jointly initiate, and every ten companies shall be regarded as one association, but this limit shall not apply when overseas Chinese merchants establish chambers of commerce." It can be seen that overseas Chinese chambers of commerce have room for flexibility and do not necessarily have to have trade associations. (1) Organizations such as the current United Grand Stores are not illegal in organizing chambers of commerce. (2) Regarding the establishment of articles of association, attention must be paid to the laws and regulations of the local government. Since overseas Chinese chambers of commerce must register with the local government, the articles of association can be drafted with reference to the local regulations, and it is also possible to follow the revised Chamber of Commerce Law of our country and file with the home government, so that both parties can be taken care of. (3) Regarding the issue of dual nationality, overseas Chinese who grow up overseas often obtain local nationality, which is the result of the principle of territoriality. However, our country's Nationality Law adopts the principle of consanguinity. Since the people mentioned are of our country's bloodline, they are naturally citizens of our country and can enjoy the right to vote in our country's chambers of commerce. According to Article 11 of the Nationality Law, "Those who have acquired foreign nationality may renounce the nationality of the Republic of China with the permission of the Ministry of Interior." Furthermore, Article 6 of the Implementing Rules of the Nationality Law stipulates, "Those who acquire or lose the nationality of the Republic of China in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 5 and Article 11 of the Nationality Law shall designate one type of news publication in the interior to announce the fact that the applicant has acquired or lost nationality." Overseas Chinese should not claim to have lost nationality, and if they have not obtained the permission of the Ministry of Interior, then they have dual nationality and should still be regarded as citizens of China and do not need to withdraw from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, etc.</p>
<h3>More Than a Dozen Machinists Recruited to Go to the Northwest, to Serve on the Northwest Highway Route</h3>
<p>During the war, our country's rear transportation was actively expanded. In the past two years, the government authorities have actively developed the resources of the western and northern provinces, organized local construction, and developed transportation plans. At present, the highway networks of Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other provinces have gradually been completed. There is a great demand for machinists and other personnel on various transportation lines. The authorities have recruited from both domestic and overseas sources. Thousands of overseas Chinese machinists from various parts of Southeast Asia have responded to the call to return to the country to serve, and most of them have been assigned to work in Yunnan Province. As for the Northwest Highway, the transportation line is extremely long, from Chengdu, Sichuan Province, directly to the Soviet border. There is also a great need for mechanical personnel on the entire line. Recently, personnel were sent to Hong Kong to recruit. The salary for each person is 60 yuan in national currency per month. The contract is temporarily set for one year. If both parties agree after the expiration, the contract can be renewed. Three months' salary will be paid in advance for the first term. The recruitment procedures are extremely simple. Those who pass the examination will be recruited. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, many mechanics and engineers have fled to Hong Kong; many have no stable employment after arriving in Hong Kong. They are happy to respond to the call to return to the country to serve. Currently, more than a dozen people have already set out for the Northwest to take office. It is said that there will be a second batch continuing to return to the country in the future.</p>
<h3>Another Hero Leaves the Ma Tau Chung Concentration Camp</h3>
<p>A hero in the Ma Tau Chung concentration camp, because of his keen determination to fight the enemy, was constantly thinking of ways to leave the camp and rejoin the front line. In the past, more than a dozen people have left. At three o'clock yesterday morning, because the guards were fast asleep, another hero named Xie Shaoji sneaked out of the camp. The hero was 31 years old, from Hunan. The guards searched but could not find any trace.</p>
<h3>Printing Industry Labor-Management Agreement Begins to be Implemented, Yesterday was Sunday and All Printing Houses Were Closed</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the printing industry, which had been going on for more than a month, has been resolved satisfactorily through the mediation of the Labor Department and Ye Lanquan. Yesterday was the first day of the printing industry's weekly day of rest. All printing bureaus and lithographic bureaus in Hong Kong were closed. Since Hong Kong's history, it was the first time that the printing industry closed all day on Sunday. Because the matter was sudden, many time-sensitive printed materials could not be delivered on time, such as the theaters. Because they were not prepared in advance, there were no theater programs at the opening, and many viewers complained. It is believed that there are many other time-sensitive printed materials that cannot be delivered on time, but this is only a temporary phenomenon. In the future, both parties may have ways to rectify.</p>

<h3>The Bank of China Pays Attention to the Overseas Chinese Remittance Business, Branches and Managers' Offices are Established Throughout the Ports of Southeast Asia, to Absorb Overseas Remittances and Strengthen the Financial Foundation During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese compatriots remit tens of millions of dollars back to the country every year. This huge amount of remittances is of great benefit to our country's foreign exchange, especially during the War of Resistance, the impact of overseas remittances is even more important. The Bank of China is one of the four major banks in our country, and has been authorized by the National Government to conduct international foreign exchange for more than 20 years. It has more than 200 branches and offices throughout the country, and has also established branches and managers' offices in various countries around the world to handle domestic and foreign exchange deposits and remittances. Since the War of Resistance, the bank has paid great attention to the overseas Chinese remittance business. Recently, in order to develop its business, it has successively established branches in Singapore, Batavia, Rangoon, and Hanoi to facilitate overseas Chinese remittances in Southeast Asia. At the same time, it is also planning to establish managers' offices in Siam, Surabaya, Medan, Kuala Lumpur, and Medan to absorb overseas remittances. According to bank staff reporters, the establishment of various branches or manager's offices in the future will not only protect the interests of overseas Chinese, but the remittances of overseas Chinese will certainly be more considerable, and the financial and basic foundation of our country during the War of Resistance will be greatly strengthened.</p>

<h3>Food Industry Association Decides: Only Vegetarian Food to be Sold on "July 7th"; Restaurants Create Anti-Japanese War Vegetarian Menu Named "Wan Ti"; Respond to Bond and Flower Purchasing Campaigns</h3>
<p>The second anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War is only four days away. Various overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong, in order to commemorate this great day, have not only scheduled a memorial meeting for that day, but also unanimously responded to the United Relief Organization's vegetarian food festival and flower-selling fundraising campaign. The flower-selling work has been underway for several days, with 300,000 flowers already distributed. The vegetarian food festival is also being actively promoted. Hong Kong's pig, cattle, sheep, chicken, duck, fish, and meat merchants' associations have already decided to suspend slaughtering on the 7th. The food shops, restaurants, teahouses, tea rooms, Western restaurants, and merchants' associations also held a meeting yesterday and decided to unanimously sell vegetarian food on "July 7th."</p>
<p>Meeting Decides: Sell Vegetarian Food</p>

Other non-member colleagues are also notified to follow suit, in order to solemnly commemorate the day. Major restaurants in Hong Kong and Kowloon have prepared everything and plan to sell famous vegetarian menus on the "July 7th" anniversary. Several major restaurants in Hong Kong have already created anti-Japanese war vegetarian menus, naming dishes with anti-Japanese war and national salvation slogans to alert overseas Chinese. Tea houses, on the other hand, will follow last year's method, completely replacing the meat fillings in the dim sum they sell with vegetarian ingredients and renaming them with names such as "Resist Japan and Save the Country," "Resist Japan to the End," "Scorched Earth Resistance," "Kill All × People," and "Final Victory," to inspire people. The intention is quite profound.</p>

<h3>Britain Intensifies Training of New Recruits; Calls Veteran Soldiers in Hong Kong Back to the Country to Serve as Instructors</h3>
<p>Britain has recently implemented conscription. Although Hong Kong has not received a conscription order, it is also affected. Due to the sharp increase in the number of new recruits in Britain, the need for military instructors has suddenly become acute. The British military has therefore taken the step of transferring officers stationed in the Far East and India back to the country for training. Some veterans and retired officers stationed in Hong Kong have been ordered to return to the country to participate in instructor training courses and serve as instructors for new recruits after graduation.</p>
<h3>Wing On Life Insurance Company Provides Free Vaccinations to Ensure the Safety of Policyholders</h3>

<h3>Three Hundred Private Prostitutes Transform into Escort Girls; Escort Agencies Also Required to Pay Special Fees; Those with Potential Influence are Responsible for Maintenance</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, an English-language weekly newspaper reported that after the banning of prostitution in Hong Kong, the number of private prostitutes has increased dramatically. If they are aware of their illegal status, they must make friends with those who have potential influence and pay special fees for maintenance. Each private prostitute bears several tens of dollars per month. In the past, when the prostitutes in Shek Tong Tsui changed their profession to become singers, they tried to stop paying special fees, but ultimately failed. This year, escort agencies have been established one after another, like bamboo shoots after rain, because the name is newer and they are exempt from the burden of special fees. Therefore, private prostitutes in various districts have successively joined escort agencies, or five or seven sisters operate a love nest together, and the sign of escort is hung up, thus transforming private prostitutes into escorts. As a result, the income of influential figures has been greatly affected. Calculating only in the Central District, there are already three hundred private prostitutes who have become escorts, and some of them have previously owed special fees, which are not paid, resulting in a loss of approximately 15,000 yuan. Influential figures are constantly coming up with new names, and the term "escort" has already been clearly denounced by judges as a disguised form of prostitution. If this continues, it is truly unbearable. Therefore, they have contacted various escort agencies, instructing them to pay special fees as before. Several escort agencies fear that the contact will affect their business and have already agreed to pay. This kind of action is expected to soon become widespread among escort agencies.</p>
<h3>All Hong Kong Youth Groups to Present Swords to Leader to Comfort Soldiers; Organizational Outline Drafted by Student Relief Association; Meeting Tonight to Discuss; Expected to be Realized in August</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Student Relief Association held its third executive committee meeting a few days ago and decided to hold a sword presentation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and comfort the soldiers at the front during the summer vacation, to show respect for the leader and love for the soldiers. Later, because this event was of great significance and should be held more solemnly, the sword presentation campaign was expanded to invite youth groups from all over Hong Kong to participate. It was decided to convene a representative meeting of youth groups from all walks of life in Hong Kong at 7:30 p.m. today to discuss the process. The initiator, the Student Relief Association, in order to facilitate the discussion of various issues at tomorrow night's meeting, has drafted an organizational outline for the sword presentation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the comfort of the soldiers at the front. The content is roughly named "Hong Kong Youth's Sword Presentation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Comfort to the Soldiers at the Front Association." The organization takes the Hong Kong Youth Representative as the highest authority, and under it are the Sword Presentation and Comfort to the Soldiers Committee. Under the committee are the General Affairs, Finance, Publicity, and General Affairs departments, each with a number of clerks or directors. The representatives who will depart for the sword presentation and comfort, and the fundraising methods, will be the most important agenda items tonight. The fundraising methods can be roughly divided into two items: group responsibility and fundraising from all walks of life. The preparatory committee will be established at tonight's meeting to be responsible for preparing everything. According to the initiator of the sword presentation campaign, this sword presentation and comfort campaign represents the respect of all Hong Kong youth to the supreme leader and the comfort of the soldiers at the front. It is hoped that youth groups from all over Hong Kong will actively participate. The preparations are progressing smoothly, and this event is expected to be realized in August of this year.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Radio Station Suspected of Being Disrupted by Foreign Radio Waves; General Speculation is That It is the Work of ×</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's Z K radio station, which specializes in Chinese broadcasts, has been disrupted repeatedly in recent weeks. At first, it was thought to be accidental, but the repeated occurrence is very noticeable. As for the source of the disrupting radio waves, according to general speculation, only China or × are possible. However, Hong Kong's broadcasts do not contain any propaganda that is unfavorable to China, so why would there be disruption? As for × taking the initiative, it seems credible. Recently, the radio station set up by × in Guangzhou broadcasts mostly anti-British and anti-Hong Kong language every day. In North China and Shanghai, it has even set up powerful radio stations in close proximity to broadcast to Britain and the United States, disrupting them vigorously. As for the Chongqing Central Radio Station, it concentrates its target and disrupts it non-stop for twenty-four hours a day. Even Hong Kong's ZEW Western radio station has been disrupted repeatedly recently.</p>

<h3>More Than Eighty Students Transferred from Diocesan Boys' School; The Storm Comes to an End</h3>
<p>Due to the opposition to Taiwanese students serving in the class, a storm occurred among the students of Diocesan Boys' School. Although Chairman He Minghua, Bishop, Huang Shi Luo Xuxiang, and Li Zhengyao, the head of the Student Relief Association, served as mediators one after another, they went to extremes and ultimately could not mediate. After half a month, according to a recent survey, the students who suspended classes and schools still insisted that they would not return to school if their goals were not achieved. However, for the sake of their future studies, they asked the school to give them a leaving certificate so that they could transfer to another school. The school also granted their request. It is heard that as many as eighty students have received leaving certificates to transfer to another school, and more than twenty students have returned to school to continue their studies. This major school storm will come to an end.</p>

In order to continue to relieve the young people who have lost their studies in the war zone and the poor students in Hong Kong, the school plans to set up 200 half-fee quotas for middle school students in the war zone and 100 half-fee quotas for poor middle school students in Hong Kong in the autumn enrollment of the 28th year. That is, if the students in the school's summer class have good results upon graduation, they will not only be able to be promoted to each street without examination, but also enjoy the same free and half-fee preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Chinese Amateur Alumni Association Holds Literary Evening</h3>

<p>Life Insurance Principles</p>
<h3>Life Insurance and the Promotion of Education</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhuolun</p>
<p>Parents have two important missions for their children: one is to raise them, and the other is to educate them. In fact, the problem of education is the problem of raising them: conversely, if they cannot be educated, they cannot be raised. Therefore, education and raising them are equally important, or the problem of education is even more important! Therefore, as parents, if they plan for their children's future, they do not have to worry about the management of inheritance. The first thing they should pay attention to is the education plan. Those who are wealthy can set aside a fund in advance so that their children can go from elementary school to middle school to university when they reach a certain age, which would be great; but when they are not very wealthy and cannot set aside a large sum of money in advance, it becomes a problem. The best way is to take out an education annuity life insurance. This insurance method has several advantages:</p>
<p>(1) For the education fund, you can pay in advance on an annual basis, without the burden of a one-time payment, and the insurance cost is low. For example, if you pay three or several tens of yuan per year, you will have a preparation of one thousand yuan, which is easy and everyone can do it.</p>
<p>(2) The education fund can be determined and is not affected by accidents along the way. Because life insurance has the advantages of paying survival refunds and death compensation, if you encounter an accident after taking out the insurance, even if you have paid a small amount of premium, the company will still have to bear the responsibility for compensation. When the policy is due, the payment will be made according to the agreement for the expenses accumulated by the insured, which is very different from depositing money in the bank on an annual basis, where you can only receive the amount you have saved in the event of an accident.</p>
<p>(3) The education annuity is withdrawn in installments, so it will not be used for other purposes. Because school education has a certain time limit, taking the whole amount at once is often easy to be used for other purposes due to temporary emergencies. It must be withdrawn in installments to achieve the purpose of cultivating children. With these advantages, the meaning of education annuity insurance can be clearly understood. As the ancients said, children are away from foolishness, books must be read, and they must be practiced after reading. You should prepare as early as possible. Saving some miscellaneous expenses today and paying insurance premiums for your children is really worth paying attention to.</p>

<h3>A Comparison of the Life Insurance Business Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>— Li Quanshi</p>
<p>In order to promote the importance of the life insurance business, the Wing On Life Insurance Company publishes a special life insurance supplement in the Hong Kong Shen Bao newspaper monthly. As the second issue is being prepared, I was specially requested to contribute an article. Unable to refuse the kind invitation, I will, despite my limited knowledge, present a comparison of the life insurance business between China and Japan for the consideration of knowledgeable individuals.</p>
<p>Looking back, China opened its doors to the world twelve years earlier than Japan (China officially opened in 1842, while Japan opened in 1854). Logically, all modernization efforts, including the development of the life insurance business, should have been more advanced in China than in Japan. However, the facts show the opposite. I do not wish to delve deeply into the reasons for this in this article. I will only discuss the prosperity and decline of the life insurance business in China and Japan, from which other aspects can be inferred.</p>
<p>Since the Sonno Joi movement and the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been emulating Western science in all aspects. It has also implemented a comprehensive system for financial organizations. In addition to the central bank, special banks, savings banks, trust companies, and securities companies, various insurance companies have been established. The insurance company system is roughly divided into companies that underwrite property loss risks, such as fire, marine, and movable property insurance, and companies that underwrite life loss risks, such as life, military service, simplified life, and postal annuities (divided into joint-stock and mutual types), as well as state-run institutions. The following is a statistical table of the development of the life insurance industry in Japan in the past five years for reference:</p>

<p>Total　14,094,662　16,007,021　18,260,742　12,078,549　24,879,323 (Source: Japanese Toyo Keizai English Edition, May issue this year, page 333)</p>
<p>The above table shows that the total effective sum insured of new and existing policyholders in the Japanese life insurance industry at the end of November last year reached a huge number of 24,879,323,000 yen. How does this compare with the total business volume of Chinese-run life insurance companies in our country? According to the latest China Financial Yearbook published in Shanghai, page 094, the total business volume of Chinese-run life insurance companies is as follows:</p>
<p>Hua An He Qun　08,406,854 yuan</p>
<p>Wing On Life　3,556,077 yuan</p>
<p>Sincere Life　1,969,712 yuan</p>
<p>Taiping　1,316,290 yuan</p>
<p>China　920,746 yuan</p>
<p>Ning Shao Life　537,969 yuan</p>
<p>Total　16,708,287 yuan</p>
<p>Assuming the effective sum insured is 20 times the total business volume, the total would be: 334,165,740.</p>
<p>The above table shows that even if the effective sum insured is 20 times the total business volume of each life insurance company, the total is only 334,165,740 yuan, which is only one-seventy-fourth of the effective sum insured in Japan. The contrast is too pitiful. However, if the effective sum insured of foreign insurance companies for compatriots in our country is also included in the calculation, the difference will certainly not be as significant. How to strive to promote life insurance and catch up with Japan is the task of those who are engaged in this business in our country.</p>
<p>A Brief Comment</p>
<h3>A Word for Policyholders</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yandan</p>
<p>The insurance business in our country began to sprout about fifty years ago. Initially, foreign companies recruited people from our country to take out insurance policies. It was not until the first year of the Republic of China that companies with Chinese capital began to operate. Since then, more than a dozen large and small companies have emerged. After decades of promotion, the life insurance business in our country has established a considerable foundation. However, its development still requires our efforts to promote it in order to achieve results in the future.</p>
<p>(1) Do Not Be Superstitious About Fate</p>
<p>In the past, the people of our country were unenlightened, and most people in society attributed the success or failure of their life's endeavors to fate and geomancy. Their minds were muddled, their knowledge was scarce, and they had no understanding of scientific common sense. Therefore, they lacked keen insight to carefully examine and make thorough plans when facing matters. They were also unable to prevent problems before they occurred and prepare for contingencies. If misfortune occurred, they could only complain about bad luck or suspect that the ancestral tombs were not well located. It is important to know that we are born into this world and face various dangerous situations, such as fire, disability, and death. The occurrence of these dangers cannot be prevented by individuals in advance, but it is necessary to find ways to remedy the loss of property and economic ability. The function of various insurances is to enable a large number of people who are concerned about the same type of danger to contribute a corresponding amount of money to help the victims and ensure the safety of each individual. If you are worried about danger and death, you can use life insurance to compensate for the losses caused by death.</p>
<p>(2) Support Chinese-Funded Companies</p>
<p>In the past, the life insurance business in our country was mostly controlled by foreign-funded companies, and the profits were countless every year. In the past two or three decades, people with lofty ideals, driven by patriotism and seeking ways to remedy the situation, organized Chinese-funded companies to engage in the life insurance business. However, the general public believed that foreign companies had a long history and better credit, so they often targeted foreign companies when taking out insurance. This kind of observation and psychological error is probably due to a lack of understanding of the organization of life insurance companies. It is important to know that all the organizations of life insurance companies are based on scientific methods. For the amount of insurance underwritten, regardless of size, a reserve fund must be set aside. This reserve fund is calculated precisely based on mortality tables and investment interest rates. If you take out life insurance with a foreign company, all the premiums paid during the year will be remitted abroad for investment, and the profits will flow out, which is extremely harmful. In this era of national financial difficulties and national disasters, all our citizens should rise up and support Chinese-funded companies in order to strengthen the country's economic power.</p>
