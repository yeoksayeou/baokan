<p>社評</p>
<h3>展開游擊區民衆運動</h3>
<p>自抗戰轉人新階段後，游擊戰之作用已日見重大，軍委會通令「淪陷區」應一律改稱「游擊區」，卽表示凡日乂所踐踏之地方，卽應展開廣大之游擊戰爭，固不僅正名而已也。游擊戰爭雖係軍事動作，然必須與民衆運動相配合，始克成功；蓋游擊戰爭之性質，决非如汪精衛所云「游來游去」之流寇式的剽掠，而實係隨時隨地可以發動之襲擊，非軍隊民衆打成一片，固無以成就此工作也。然則「配合」云云，其詞意猶且未足，無甯謂為游擊區之民衆運動，應更重於軍事動作耳。</p>
<p>夫日乂鐵蹄之所至，僅能佔領點」「線」，不能佔領全「面」，此意盡人喻之；顧所謂點綫之地，「地」雖淪陷而「人」固未嘗淪陷也。持機械論者將以為凡地之巳淪陷者根本已無「人」，蓋軍隊未退，民衆先已疏散，迨軍隊旣撤，民衆亦隨赴後方，日乂所得者焦土空城，無物資亦無人民，卽有留居未走者，非老弱卽漢奸耳。顧實際有未盡然者；中國除少數交通都會者外，均係農業社會，鄉村固無論矣，其集居城市者亦無非地主及農業社會所需要之小商人及手工業者；農業社會之人民均安土重遷，不肯輕離鄉井，卽一度忍痛拋棄其田園，不久仍必歸鄉，重理故業，試觀古來詩人騷客之所吟咏，無非聞鷓鴣而垂涕，覩明月而思鄉，絕少以壯遊勉人者也。彼日乂深悉此種心理，故佔領一地搜索屠殺以後，卽故示小惠，實施「宣撫」工作，招納民衆，使避難他鄉者復歸故土，逃居村野者重返城市，故如江南各地，淪陷後三數月，民衆之賦歸者卽已十之六七。此輩民衆初非漢奸，祗以生計所迫，旅外不易，不得不暫返家園，過其含垢忍辱之苟安生活。日日乂以為此亦點綴品而亦壓榨品也，乃利用漢奸，勸告復業，興辦敎育，徵收租賦，推行烟賭，刀劍毒藥，兼施並用，榨取之外，復加麻醉，務使收效，於槍砲炸彈以上，此亦彼之所謂民衆運動也。夫人心每貪近安而忘遠慮，閱時旣久，印象易滅，乂人之民衆運動，今雖未必收效，然苟假以時日，未嘗不可以掩飾其殘暴之陳迹；故為今之計，我政府卽應加强淪陷各地民衆運動之機構，敎育民衆，訓練民衆，曉以大義，陳以利害，使無為勢迫，無為利誘，則此萬千民衆，目前不資乂用，異日仍為國寶。如我政府對此放鬆一步，日乂卽得減少一分阻礙，增加一分實力，得失之間，所繫極大。故竊以為游擊區內卽使無軍事動作之時，民衆運動仍應為非常重要之經常工作。血</p>
<p>民衆運動方法至夥，要之不外組織與訓練兩端。組織之法宜取秘密結社形式，軍位不妨較小，分布務求廣大，以游擊隊政訓工作人員總其成。他如宗敎團體，行會祖織，凡可資利用者均應充分利用，發揮其效力。訓練之法，除游擊戰爭所需要之軍訓以外，更須注意一般之訓練。為通俗而易於推行起見，不妨提出若干平易可行之口號，作為一般民衆共遵之信條，如「不向偽組織完糧」，「不進偽機關吃飯」「不吿密」「不上偽衙門打官司」「不送子女進偽學校讀書」「不買賣仇貨」「非必要不坐游擊區內火車輪船汽車」等項，在每一小組織內卽以此信條互相宣誓，信守不淪，如有違反，小組織卽加以制裁。此事至淺至易，苟能普遍推行，則錦繡山河，實際毫未淪陷，日乂之所佔者並「點」「綫」亦不如矣。</p>

<h3>作事與作人</h3>
<p>— 孔祥熙</p>
<p>——對財務人員訓練所學生訓詞——</p>
<p>【重慶通訊】孔院長日前對財務人員訓練所學生訓話、列舉財務人員作事與作人兩大原則、闡述綦詳、於理財之觀念及方法、根據學理與經驗、發揮多有獨到之處、而勵動戒奢、於目前世風之澆漓、尤不啻痛下針砭也、茲探誌全文以餉讀者、</p>
<p>諸位敎職員，諸位同學、上次對大宗講話的時候、會經舉出三個要點、以相期勉、就是說財務人員第一要才德并重、第二要樹立風節、第三要忠誠明敏、吃苦耐勞、今天打算就下列兩個問題、再和大衆說幾句話、第一是理財的觀念問題、第二是自身的修養問題、前者是財務人員作事的原則、後者是財務人員作人的原則、</p>
<p>（甲）理財的觀念問題</p>
<p>財務人員必須具備的條件、當然是要有理財的學識和理財的技術、但理財的基本觀念、也必須正確、如果觀念　誤、不但財理政不好、影響所及、勢必至於禍國殃民、所謂理財的基本觀念、最要緊有以下兩種、</p>
<p>（第一）理財要顧民力、不可竭澤而漁、要想國家財政充裕、必須要稅收暢旺、要稅收暢旺、必須要培養稅源、所以善於理財的人、不專以搜刮為能事、而嬰以扶植民九為先務、要知道辦理財政、不是掠奪性質、而是先有耕紜、然後纔能收穫的、掠奪財物者、當然把所有的錢財、統統拿去、不使稍有齡留、但是種田生產的人、就不肯道樣作、譬如農人割韮菜的時候、總是留下菜根、以便再生起來、若是連根都拔去、也許常時可以多一點收穫、然而以後就不再生長了、外國有個笑話、一個人麥了一隻　、每天生一個金蛋、他計算一下、這只鵝一年可以生三百多個金蛋、但一天只生一個、似乎太慢、因此就想剖開鵝吐、把所有的金蛋一次取出、但是割開後、肚裏却只有一個金蛋、而鵝是死了、以後蛋也沒有了、所以說我們要顧全民力、不可剝削悉素使人民無復蘇的餘地、當我就任財政部長以後、會召開了一個令國財政會讓、在會內就提議廢除一切苛捐雜稅、當時各省市代表對這個問題、原則上雖都表示同意、可是切實去作、大衆都有難色、因為地方預算、多半是靠這項收入挹注一旦廢除、必使巳經支絀的地方財政、更覺難以籌措、一切政務、都有停頓之虞、所以就有主張保留的有主張修正的、經再三解釋、並允許對地方軍政費用、由中央酌量補助以後、才决議通過、幾年以來、各省市已經廢除的苛雜捐稅總計起來共有五十多種、其中當然難免有許多是名目重複的、但由此可知種類之多了、至於廢除的稅額、總共也有六千多萬、當時有人笑我說、我接任的時候、國庫裏僅有三個月的準備費、而各種收入、毫無起色、中央自顧不暇、反來補助地方、未免失之迂闊、殊不知我所用是播種辦法、把種子下在田要、到時自會有更大的收穫、這幾年以來、財政上所以能够日漸好轉、未嘗不是得力於這一點、王安石說過、『欲足用、必先理財』又說、『置官理財、非以佐私欲』、意思就是國家要有合理的收入、當取者取、不當取者寧可放棄、不可任意搜刮、以免喪國本、諸位同學將來都是辦理財務的公務人員、公務人員第一要緊的是認識自身的立場、你們自身的立場是什麼、就是一方面要替國家收取合理的收人、同時要扶植民力、不光收稅、更要培養稅源、</p>
<p>其次、理財要注意民心的向背、為政須得民心、這是政治上基本條件、因為政府是建設在人民的信任所以政府必須求得人民擁護、官吏必須求得人民的信仰、然後纔能在自已所執行的職務上、得到成功、做財務人員本來不易、因為財務行政、着重在征稅收捐、要向老百姓要錢、而在人民方　、無論他愛國的程度如何、對於收稅人要錢、總覺得是件不愉快的事情、所以我們一方面要謹愼執行我們收稅職務、同時還要體恤的衆的痛苦、說民力之强弱、為征收的標準、務使負担平允、民無怨尤、這樣就可以算是一個善於理財的人了、</p>
<p>（第二）理財要從大處着眼、小處着手，所謂大處着眼、就是要設法開闢遠大的財源、而不斤斤於錙珠之計較、這幾年來、我們一方要廢除苛捐雜稅、同時開辦所得遺產稅等、公平普遍的稅收、就是這個道理、歐陽修說「為政寬簡、而事不弛廢、所謂寬者、為苛不急、所謂簡者、不為繁碎」這寬簡二字、也就是從大處着眼的意思、但是大處着眼還不够、同時也要小處着手、就是財務人員對於本身的職務、無論鉅細、都要小心翼翼、認眞執行、凡屬公欵、雖涓　亦必歸公、不可因數目微小、就忽略不收、須知積腋可以成裘，滴水常流、可以斬成汪洋、國家度支鉅萬、也都是積少成多而致、至於支出方面、則動用公帑、要要絲毫不苟、不可稍涉糜費、對於日常事務尤應黽勉從事、斷不可慢不經心、怠惰廢弛、本來財務行政、是非當煩瑣的、偶一不愼、弊端百出、中國財務機關的種種積弊、多半是由於小事上太疏忽、若是小事上能够作的好、大事自然會有成績、所謂行千里者始百步、這是必然的道理</p>
<p>公務人員是政府的代表、人民的表率、在社會居於轉移風氣的地位、必須自身的志節學行有很好的修養、方能取信於民、執行法令、所謂「已立立人、已達達人」者是也、財務人目職司度支、個人行為的善惡、關係人民的切身利害、尤須持身淸正、奉公守法、纔能克盡職守、在專制時代、各地的縣衙門裏、都有一座牌樓、叫做上諭牌樓、上邊寫的四句話、是「爾俸爾祿、民膏民脂、下民易虐、上天難欺」、中間還有三個大字、是「勤」「儉」「愼」、就是告訴作官的人、要他們知道自已的俸祿、都是民脂民膏、不可欺天枉法、虐待百姓、從前中國雖是專制政體、但還有一種道德觀念、　繫人心、做皇帝的也都時時刻刻繫念人民、誥誡官吏、要以「動儉愼」來替百姓服務、現在雖然時代不同、然而這幾個字仍不失為官吏的箴規、所以今天打算把三個字奉告大家、</p>
<p>第一勤、古語說「勤能補拙」又說「業精於勤、荒於戲」、古人齊家治國、都以勤為先、晉陶侃朝運百甓於室外、暮運百甓於室內、終年不輟、就是練習勤勞的習慣、從前作皇帝的、都是五更上朝、為人臣者講究握髮叶哺、皇帝辦公的地方叫作「勤政殿一、春秋郊祀、要親身耕作、都是在勤字上用工夫、中國常說「不怕慢、、只怕站」、一勤天下無難字、歐洲有一價故事說一，個黽和一個兎競走、兎自以為跑的快、勝利一定有把握的、所以漫不經心、跑到半途就找了一塊陰凉的草地、去休息陲覺、那隻龜知道自已走得慢、恐怕趕不上、所以一刻不停地趕路、等到兎一覺醒來、跑到終點、龜早已到了目的地了、這就是一個動能補拙的例証、晚近中國社會習氣、講究應酬、往往吃酒打牌、直到深夜才止、應睡的時候不睡、到明天作事當然沒有精神、應該八八點鐘上班、到十點還沒有起床、要是這樣，前途沒有不失敗的、個人如此、國家民族也是一樣、委員長前幾天在行營訓話、也會說到現在前方將士浴血苦戰、淪陷區的人民痛苦日深、可是在後方如像還沒有知道這些悲慘情况、仍然是歌舞昇平、商女不知亡國恨的局面、這種現象、國家民族怎能够復與起來、一個民族、若要强盛、其先决的條件、就是人民能「勤」、個人做事要求成功、最主要的、是這個「動宇」、所以上次我告訴大家、世界許多大發明家大事業家、莫不由「勤」字得來的、</p>
<p>第二、儈、儉是不浪費的意思、一切飲食起居、應力求節省、自舉以儉、惟能自奉以儉、方不至為物慾所蔽、個人操守才能淸正廉潔、所以說儉　養廉、公務員的薪俸·叫做廉俸·是為養廉用的、中國社會上對干官更的印象、向來不好，就是看做官的人、是貪污納賄、勒索人民的尤其是財務人員、因為常經手我欵更易認為剝削人民的份子、推原其故、就是因為有此公務人員、生活奢侈的毛病、其實一個人在世界上、吃穿用途、都是有限制的、如果恣口腹之慾、貪婪過　、不但無益、反有損害、譬如吃東西、如果吃的過飽、不但不易消化、而且會生毛病、外國人常說中國人都有胃病、就是因為吃的太多、外國人的食量都是很小、就是宴會酬酢、也不於奢靡、我們中堅人吃飯的時俄、拌往是四盤大碗珍饈雜陳其實眞正吃了的沒有多少、大部份是浪費掉了、因此有「朱門酒肉臭」之諺、其餘衣着用　、也都窮奢極慾、毫無節制、現在許多公務人員、月入一百二百、甚至三百四白、然而還是負債累累、這就是不知道儉、平時任意揮霍、所入不敷所出、到了債台高築、逼得無法可想的時候、就發生貪污的行為、今後要求國家政治淸、明必得公務人員從廉字上面着手·若要能廉·就必得從儉字上用工夫、一個國家的財政、沒有預算、就不能算是一個健全的國家、一個人自已沒有預算、就不能在社會上生活、所以無論那一個人生活費用都應該有一個預算、對於衣食應酬、兒女敎育、醫藥等等費用、都要有適當的支配、並目應提出一部份來作為儲蓄、因為儲蓄是致富之源、從前中東鐵路建造的時候、雖由俄國出面、但資本多半來自法國、而且都是法國儲蓄銀行的存欵、法國的人民、不問收入多少、都要提出一部份來積蓄、譬如賺十個法郎的、祗用五六個法郎、把其餘的四個儲蓄起來、賺六個法郎的、只化五個、剩下一個存在銀行裏、就是窮苦的人，也能從節衣縮食上扣下儲蓄、預備將來義老之用、這已成了法國人民的習慣、今天要同大家說的，就是今後我們要造成「儉」的風氣、每個人都應養成　蓄的習慣、自已把所收入的、除了生活必需的費用以外、要留一部份積蓄起來、為將來年老時之生活之需、誠　如此、不但國家政治可以淸明、各個人的生活、也有了保障、</p>
<p>第三、愼、愼是進德之本、能够謹言慎行、方是有德之君子、纔可以治國安邦、大學上說「欲治其國、必先濟其家·欲齊其家·必先修其身、欲修其身、必先正其心」、就是說治國要從修身做起、現在許多人都忘了我國古聖先賢的敎訓、學校裏連經書也不講了、但我覺得四書五經詳細看看、宋太祖時趙普以半部論語治天下、在目前科學昌明時代，四書五經、雖然不够應付需要、但還有研究的價値、所以總理主張提倡固有道德、對於孔孟之學、亦悉心研讀、手不釋卷、本黨總裁蔣委員畏對於四書五經、也是孜孜不倦的研究、實因古書中所句含治國的道理很多、就以理財來說、大學上也「有人斯有土、有土斯有財、有財斯有用、德者本也、財者末也、這發句話、是何等天經地義的議論、至於作人修身的方法、古聖先賢的敎訓中更是運篇累牘、只要大家勤川揣磨、自有好處、諸君不久就要服務國家、須知中國現在所缺乏的不完全是學術、而是忠奮耿耿、不辭勞苦犧牲為國的人、必須多有這樣的人、政治才能淸明、國家才有辦法、不然、多設幾个機關、多用幾個人，你舞弊、教貪污、人民出錢愈多、國家前途愈危險、過去外國人為什麼看不起我們就是因為他們以為中國人可以出錢收買的、個個都是貪贓納賄的、所以人家會利用中國人來搗中國人的亂、慫恿這個軍閱、打倒那個軍閥、使中國不能統一、但現在的情形就不同了、最近土肥原對人表示說、日本參謀本部過去判斷中國的事情、一向很正確、每次內戰發生時、那一個失敗、那一個勝利、都能事前知過、可是這一回日本參謀本部很奇怪、他們所預的料、在事實上根本不然、這就是因為我們全國一致的最高領袖領導之下、不受他們的利用、雖有幾個漢奸、作日本人的愧儡、但那些都是早已不齒於人類的東西了、正人君子都誓死不受利用、這就是一種民族正氣、國家有這種正氣、人民有這種風格、决不至於滅亡的、講到愼字、也是要從自已作起、古人講究「愼獨」、不但在人前不作壞事、就是別人若不見的時候、也是要戒愼恐懼、　着良心作事、守口如瓶、守身如王、不作欺夭枉法的事、我們現在所應努力的、不但自已要做好人好事、而目要勸人做好人好事、也就是自已做好人好事之外、面要舉發別人做壞事、能够這梯、國家才有辦法、政治才能走上正軌、希望大家對干這一點要切實注意、造成一種風氣、使壞人不敢抬頭、想舞弊也沒有機會、這就是我所希望的、其各勉　、</p>
<h3>華北抗戰槪況　與今後形勢估計（二）</h3>
<p>— 彭德懷　于鳴鳳</p>
<p>（續昨日本報第二版）</p>
<p>（b）在華北的八路軍和各友軍、對於被欺騙的一切偽組織、採取政治的　解、爭取、和軍事的消滅、這樣、得到很大的勝利、偽皇協第一軍瓦解了、李逆福和被殺了、日本顧問也殺了、第二軍全軍覆沒、軍長被擊斃、兩旅長、兩團長被捕、第三軍屢遭失啟、只留少數盤據在石家莊、不敢出來、其餘少數偽軍、、反正和被消滅者甚多、這些勝利、都不是偶然的、而是由於中國民族的覺悟與艱苦工作、造成羣衆對日×、漢奸、偽軍的仇恨、反抗他們、才能得到的、</p>
<p>（）對於各種不同漢奸份子、採取不同的具體辦法、因為反漢奸固然是堅决的、而方式都是多方面的、</p>
<p>子、對於主要的、死心塌地的大漢奸、公審按律處治、盡情暴露其事實、以之敎育民衆、</p>
<p>丑、對於動搖的漢好、却是要盡量爭取、用敎育的辦法、誘導的辦法、使其轉變過來、用「中國人不打中國人」的口號、來爭取他們、有轉變傾向的、派人和他談話、用社會力量壓迫他、把他從漢奸營壘中分化出來、</p>
<p>寅、至於那些完全搖動的漢好、如所謂「身在曹營心在漢·不殺日×心不甘」者、我們正可利用他們打聽消息、不沒收其財、保守他的秘密、這　、旣可利用他做工作、同時、又使他不敢公然附×、因為我們已捉到他的證據了、至於眞眞不得已者、要愛惜他、慢慢爭取他、這此都是我們應經試驗、而獲得成功的、但是、絕不應輕信漢奸的話、必須以事實來證明、</p>
<p>（p）對於×偽軍、用政治上的宣傳、瓦解、爭取和軍事上的打擊、消滅、這比僅憑「硬打」要好的多、同時、也完全要靠民挨竟識和抗戰情緒的提高、才能做到的。對於×軍、利用其士兵的反戰情緒、行瓦解工作、傳單、標語、散發到×軍陣營、或我退却的陣地上、×軍文化程度較高、自然容易受到傳、而動搖他們、其次、用日本話喊口號、與日軍話、日本軍隊受我宣傳、即必減少其戰鬥力、對於俘虜兵、加以優待、使其對我軍有良好印象、加以訓練、還可帮我工作、假使有多數俘虜、放之回去、擴展影響更大。所以最近津浦綫上有日軍十人、携械投降、這是一件大事、證明×軍已受我宣傳而動搖了。同時、最近戰場上、日軍已不像最初之頑強、每次戰鬥、可有大批俘虜捉將過來；至於偽軍反正、更屬數見不鮮。道些、都說明了在正確的政治工作之卜、×偽軍是可以動搖和爭取的。今天華北偽組織之無力、軍隊的失敗、都是由於正確辦法的執行。</p>
<p>華北國軍與日×的戰鬥、我大略地介紹、使關心華北戰局者得以明瞭、</p>
<p>（一）不斷地粉碎×人園攻、</p>
<p>（a）四月間晉東南×人力路園攻被粉碎、</p>
<p>（b）普西北之三次圍攻被粉碎、</p>
<p>（c）晉翼察邊區最近×人八路圍攻之被粉碎、×五萬人、死傷一萬、餘潰退、並且還打死一個×旅團長、兩個聯隊長、</p>
<p>（d）平漢路東之圍攻被粉、</p>
<p>（e）翼察熱區之三次圍均被粉碎、</p>
<p>（一）收復的領土、</p>
<p>（a）晋東南區、包括太行山脈一帶、平漢西、正大南、同蒲路東三鐵路之間的、完整的縣份有、和順、遼　、榆社、武鄉、沁縣、襄垣、黎城、涉縣、贊皇、潞城、平順、林縣、壺縣輝縣、陵川、長治、屯留、長子、高平、習城、陽城、濟源、垣曲，平陸、夏縣、翼城、浮山、沁水、安澤、沁源等三十餘縣、此外、還有沿鐵路綫的五十餘縣、是×佔城廂、我佔廣大的鄉村、</p>
<p>（b）晉察翼邊區、去年十一月打破×人圍攻、只有五台尙有少數×人、完整的縣份、有平山、靈壽行唐、阜平、源、靈邱、廣靈等—餘縣、其餘半漢路沿綫有數十縣、平綏沿綫有十餘縣、也有的×人正在進攻中、</p>
<p>（c）翼熱察區、現在有興隆、平谷、陵南、定都等數縣、</p>
<p>（d）津浦綫上之天津濟南段以東、有慶零、陽信、德平等數縣、</p>
<p>（三）軍實的繳獲、</p>
<p>我所知道的只限於八路軍、繳獲的並不多、不能滿足全國人的熱望、及蔣委員長給與之任務、非常抱歉、以後當加倍努力、爭取更多更大的勝利、來囘答諸君對八路軍之希望及蔣委員長給與之任務、</p>
<p>過去繳獲×人的計有、</p>
<p>六五步槍九千一百餘交、</p>
<p>輕機關槍五百餘　、</p>
<p>大砲十九門、</p>
<p>迫擊炮三十餘門、</p>
<p>其他軍用品尙多、</p>
<p>（四）戰略戰術的運用、</p>
<p>（a）戰略是持久的、一切以此為凖、配合全國抗戰、</p>
<p>（b）戰衛是速决的、每次戰鬥皆予×以打擊、消減、殺傷，保持戰術上的優勢、爭得速戰速决、使×發生長懼、×常常以手向民衆示意、表示對我軍的恐懼、在×後方堅持、要打得×怕我、而我不怕×、只有擊、才使×不敢游、我之行動才能自主、如×不怕我而我怕×、我則易陷於被動、這是很簡明的道理、要想×人怕我、就只有經常給×以打擊或消滅才有可能、</p>
<p>（C）爭取主動、操縱人人、使×常常限於被動、如冀東之深入、×人原以我軍突過半綏路北、於是×企圖切斷我軍聯絡、以消滅我深入翼東熱河部隊、但我毫無顧慮、順勢誘×、長驅直入、一直仲出朝陽山海關一帶、東迄遼寧、×恐我深入東北、與東北義勇軍匯合、火急調兵追趕與堵截、而我則以秘密迅速從×間隙揷至追×後方、猛擊一路而消滅之、</p>
<p>（D）活運用部隊、很機動的消滅×人、常時出×不意、使其判斷錯誤、和　擊消滅其薄弱部份、必須要秘密機動、迅速、才能制×取勝、</p>
<p>（e）華北正規軍與游擊隊的配合、甚為密切、游擊隊小組、分佈各地、與正規軍配合起來、使×人實在不易弄淸虛實、使之防不勝防、而遭受我主力突然傳擊、</p>
<p>（f）×人兵力不够分配、而我可以自由調動、華北地大、×人企圖形成整個的園攻、實在困難、所以、只有分區圍攻、我能互相配合、內外夾擊、使×數次圍攻歸於失敗、</p>
<p>（g）軍隊有高度的民族覺悟與民衆確能結成二氣、抗×情緒甚高、所以軍隊戰鬥力特別堅强、</p>
<p>華北戰爭形勢前途的估計</p>
<p>甲、我們必須深切的認識：</p>
<p>在全國戰局好轉、有利地轉到×我相持局面時、則華北戰局將愈趨嚴重、愈趨困難、而戰爭也　繁多與激烈、因為華北在地理上、和物質財富上、都為×所急於攫奪、×人欲圖鞏固華北、必然企圖掃消在華北之我軍、所以、將來戰局的形勢是：</p>
<p>（一）×人分區圍攻與據點的佔領、</p>
<p>（二）×人將企圖封鎖我之交通綫、割斷我之聯絡、</p>
<p>（三）×人政治上之欺騙與挑撥離間、以及物質上之困難也必然增加、</p>
<p>乙、堅持華北抗戰的重大意義：</p>
<p>（一）華北是我國抗戰最後主要决勝負的戰塲、</p>
<p>（二）爭取全國抗戰新形勢的到來、華北是有力的戰略箝制方面、因為日軍現在華北者、達十五師團之多、我們盡量的爭取敵人到華北來、則華北形勢愈嚴重、對于全國抗戰愈有利、在有力的牽制之下、將使×人在華中以及華南不得不停止其進攻、乘着時機使我軍在軍事委員會領導下充分地進準備反攻力量、</p>
<p>（三）堅持華北抗戰、使華北一萬萬人力與豐富的資源、不為日×所利用、以打破其以華制華的目的、和吸取華北財當來征服中國的企圖、</p>
<p>（四）對國際影響甚大、堅持華北抗戰、以爭取國際上對我之更多同情與援助、</p>
<p>（五）給全國在×人後方堅持抗戰以有力帮助、變×人後方為前綫之戰略口號具體實現、藉以興奮國人、興奮友軍、給×事實上以嚴重打擊、</p>
<p>丙、堅持華北抗戰勝利的條件：</p>
<p>華北抗戰之堅持、旣甚軍要、且困難甚多、然而戰勝日×之條件、是否有可能呢，我們堅决的囘答：本、首先我們有一萬萬人口和廣大的領土、便是勝利、的有力根據、——次：——</p>
<p>（一）華北抗戰、有全國抗戰之配合、使×人兵力不够分配、因華北抗戰不同於東北義勇軍之孤立、華北抗戰固能牽制×人、有利于全國抗戰、停止此華中華南之進攻、而全國抗戰、亦使×人不能集中華北、倘若×人能完全集中到華北去、華北固然更加堅苦，然而全國抗戰那就更為有利了、</p>
<p>（二）華北軍民有十八個月抗戰的豐富經驗、戰爭過程中、我們獲得了許多進步、華北的政治改革、軍隊紀律好、人民生活有初步改善、戰爭把華北進步起來了、同時、也敎育了華北人民、使其有高度的勝利、信心與堅持决心、經驗告訴了我們、華北抗戰有勝利的把握、中國抗戰必然也有捲利的把握、</p>
<p>（三）華北　進步的國民黨、共產黨及其他抗×黨派團體的堅强領導、在人民面前起模範作用、有正確的辦法、來堅持　戰、</p>
<p>（四）華北有廣大的面積、軍事上便於機動、且山地多、地理形勢上有利于我、卽使在廣漠平原上、經騐告訴我們、也是可以制勝的、</p>
<p>（五）華北人口衆多、物產豐富、鹽、糧食、棉花等農產、甲於全國、都是我堅持抗戰有利的條件、</p>
<p>除此而外、必須再加上兩個條件、</p>
<p>子、政治上的民主與充分的發動民衆</p>
<p>丑、精誠團結、不要有磨擦、</p>
<p>克服困難、就能堅持持久抗戰、就能配合全國、爭取最勝利</p>
<p>總之、日本×國主義之崩潰是必然的、而且為期也不在遠、中華民埃之解放、已現出曙光、只要我們堅持到底、克服困難、加緊團結、抗戰必然勝利、今天主要的問題、是全國人民的精誠團結、和國共兩黨的親密合作、國共兩黨、唇亡齒寒、休戚相關、絕不可有絲毫無擦妨害抗戰、同時、今天中國堅持抗戰、是中華民族解放的唯一正確的方向、必循須着這個時代的洪流前足、才有光明的前途、而某些逆流、妨得前進、終究必遭巨大洪流的冲洗、汪精衛的背黨叛國、便是逆流之一、自甘落後、自絕國人、中國人民在抗戰中、誰最努力、最忠實、將更傳得人民的擁護、國　兩黨需要更親密的合作、國民黨和共產黨的發展、鄱是有利于中國抗戰和民族解放、否則、國民黨和共產黨以及其他抗×黨派均不發展、難道還讓漢奸勢力發展嗎、所以必須同舟共濟、共赴　難、互相交換由中華民族血的結晶而得來的經驗和敎訓、我們必須踏着民族的血跡前進、則中華民族必然得到解放、建立三民主義燦爛光輝的新中國</p>
<h3>參加新四軍工作的日本俘虜</h3>
<p>— 報本特約記者　嚴速寄自皖南</p>
<p>因為記者聽到項央軍長談起，新四軍對付日本俘虜的方法，是非常有趣味的，所以記者要求和日本俘虜當面談一次話。</p>
<p>據項軍長說，新四軍不僅是不殺害俘虜，不僅是優侍俘虜，而且能够積極　給日本俘虜以出入，通訊，讀書，工作，的自由，因此日本俘虜在新四軍那邊，如同在自已家裏一樣，身上穿着與新四軍同樣的制服，頭上戴着靑、天白日的軍帽，在沒有事的時候，可以到大街上去自由逛逛，老百姓和弟兄們看見了也不覺得奇怪。新四軍專門負責管敎俘虜的工作的機關是「×人工作部」。據項軍畏說，新四軍作戰半年來俘獲的日偽軍，已有五百九十多人，而且共中有幾個已經可以參加新四軍做政治工作了。</p>
<p>今天早晨，在一個農民的家裘，記者經新四軍×人工作部長林植夫，和政治部副主任鄧子恢的介紹，會兒到兩位年靑的日本俘虜。當記者走進屋子的時候，他們兩人正伏在桌子上看書，他們倆同樣穿着灰布棉大衣，戴着中國的軍帽，一聽見有人，就立刻含着笑跑過來，表示出歡迎的樣子，當時要不是林長的說明，記者還滿以為這兩位是新四軍管理俘虜的工作人員呢。</p>
<p>記者和俘虜談了一個多小時，從他們的身世，家庭，戀愛等問題談到中日戰爭的前途，現在為反映他們眞實意見起見，將全部的問答紀錄寫在後面。記者（問）：你　什麼名字，日俘（答）：我叫香河正男，他（指另一日俘）叫田細作造，（以後均係記者與香河芷男之談話（問）你什麼時候到此地來的？（答）大約是今年七月底八月初。（問）你今年幾歲？（答）我今年二十二歲。（問）你在部隊裏當什麼職位？（答）在睦軍第三師團當輜重兵。（問）你的家在那裏？（答）在日本東京。（一問）家裏還有什麼人？（一答）父親母親和兩個弟弟。（問）你在日本做什麼職業？（答），我沒有職業，我在東京某高級商業學校念書。（問）你到中國從何處上岸？（答）吳淞上岸，但日本兵並不一定是從吳淞上岸，有的是從甫京上岸。（問）你什麼時候被徵人伍，什麼時候離國到中國來？（答）今年正月被徵入伍，六月調到中國來。（問）日軍部對你說到中國去做什麼的？（答）對我們說：去打中國的赤化與蔣介石；當初我們不知道日軍在中國侵掠和做出許多暴行，（問）當被徽入伍判中國來時，你和你的家人有些什麼感覺？（答）當時我精神上很痛苦，但限於國家法律，無法反抗，家裏人當然也同樣的，不願我出去。（問）你到上海二個月住在什麼地方？（答）在楊樹浦東面的一家紡織工廠內。（問）你在上海玩過什麼地方？（答）玩過閘北與南市，但景况很冷落，租界的鬧市中心，我沒有去過。（問）你有沒有看兒過日兵姦殺華人的　淸麼？（答）强姦女人，我自已沒有看見過，但聽到部隊內弟兄們常常談起的，我想他們一定有人幹過的，屠殺中國人表不僅看見過，而且看界很多成千的中國人被活活殺死，當時我心裏很難過，但僅僅是難過而已。（問）你在未被俘前，在中國已有二三個月的時間，就是拿這三個月在中國的時間講，你有什麼感想？尤其是對中日戰爭的感想？（答）因為時間很短，我看見的東西也不多，不過有一點，卽我到南京的時候，因為看見許多中國人民被殺，當時上級對我們士兵說；他們都是「匪賊」——中國的游擊隊，所以該殺。當時我心想，為什麼中國有那麼許多「匪賊」？那麼多的游擊隊？弟兄們與我有同樣的感覺，於是我們漸漸地開始對日本國內所宣傳的中支戰爭消息懷疑起來，——不過祗是內心懷疑和苦悶，要什麼行動和反抗那是很困難的。（問）你怎樣被俘的呢？（答）兩個月後，坐火車由上海到南京，在中山陵園中住二天就被派去鎭江，再由鎭江搬運火車去丹陽，就在半路一個叫一秣陵」的地方遇到新四軍的游擊隊，當時我們（日兵）有五十多人，」</p>

<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>我從廣西帶來的禮物（下）</h3>
<p>— 陶行知</p>
<p>再說到敎育。邱昌渭廳長告訴我，每縣的縣立初中，要跟着縣政府走。萬一將來某某縣城淪陷，縣政府搬到鄉下，那末這個學校，也得跟着縣政府下鄉。這是一種跟縣政府走的學校，縣政府不許搬出縣境，則學校也不許　出縣境。這種學校，每縣一個，便是造就每縣幹部人才，為游擊隊和老百姓共患難的人才。</p>
<p>其次是十八歲以上的學生，要集中訓練，以增加抗戰建國的力量，那此志願從軍，可以自告奮勇，加入學生軍團。現在學生軍團，已經成立了×個軍團。</p>
<p>廣西最普遍的，是國民基礎學校。每一個角落頭的鄉村裏，都有一個冠冕堂皇的學校。這種學校，日裏敎小孩，晚上敎成人。我到蘆墟住了二晚，吃過晚飯，就去參觀當地國民基礎學校。走進去，看見兩個課堂，坐滿了婦女學生，我仔細的數了一數，有廿二個婦女，是抱看小孩一起來上擊。這分明是家裏沒有人帶小孩，所以必得抱着，或背着小孩來讀書。這種精神，是極値得欽佩的。</p>
<p>廣西的小學校長是三位一體。村街小學校長，同時是村　長和民團後備隊隊長。中心舉校每鄉每鎮一所，校長司是鄉鎭長，民團後備大隊長。一个人兼三職，叫做三位一體。他們的薪水，是中心校長每月法幣十五元，村街學校校長每月法幣十元。我到礫江，遇看一位外江的朋友，批評這个制度。我說，據我一路看來，道制度本身很好，不但過合廣西情形，而且適合全國抗戰的需要。因為第一，它是一頭政治，沒有磨擦；第二，省錢。別的省份也可以斟酌仿行。他說：每月十元錢怎能請到幹才　我脫：第八路軍辦事人，每月母人一律五元錢，軍隊公推朱德　軍吃肉，他才有肉吃。照薪水敎目算來，廣西小學校長該能請到朱德將軍一流的人來祖任。漢口未放棄前白崇禧將軍也曾對我說過：中國現在還不能打勝仗，只是因為我們還是穿好的，吃好的。要到我們部穿了打補釘的衣服，吃飯連　也不容易弁到手，你我都像叫化子一樣，那才是我們打勝仗的時候了。</p>
<p>東北有位趙老太，廣西有位會大娘，都是値得效法的。黃任之先生曾和我說過會大娘的故事，這次到廣西，打聽一下，果然名不虛傳。廣西不單是有組織，敎育比較普及，而且老百姓自發的愛國的精神，更値的欽佩，會大娘使是這樣好的老百姓的代表。她是修仁縣人，兒子抽　未中，不能當兵上　線上，他老人家特地親自了帶兒子到縣長那兒去投効。中國的老太太，只須學到會大娘，則中國的兵源，便取之無盡，用之無窮了。還有廣西的小孩，也値　恭維，三四年前風捲雲翻的廣西小先生運動是不必說了，省會的戰時兒黨服務　，我是親自看它創造起來的。中山紀念學校的小孩唱歌團，是特　有精神。當×人飛機來的時候，勇敢的小核不願躲在　衷，他們攀上山去，債察漢奸。看見地面上漢奸用鏡子一類的東西返光指示方向，他們就立刻飛跑下山報告學生取，一同去把漢奸捉着。廣西小孩捉漢好，的確，我　見二次。</p>
<p>廣西的經濟是農村經濟，省有農業管理處，統管全省之農業設施。全省分六區，區設督導員，最下為縣農　管理處，推廣人才六百餘人，用全力在×人不能到的地方，大量增生產。不說別的，只說一樣。桐油為廣西出口最大宗。他們整個的計畫是每年，每縣種三千，每鄉種二千，每村檀一千，桐樹三年卽能結于。他們是動員全省在縣在鄉在村的老百姓一起來幹。</p>
<p>這裏回漢兩族，也是精誠團結。十一月廿七日桂林成立中國回民救國協會廣西分會。唐柯三校長和馬松學敎長，約我去　講，我看那種合作抗×的精神，眞使我為中華民族慶賀。本來囘敎敎義，是以和平為目的，以反侵略為手段。這是與中國抗戰的國策是一樣的。白將車自已是回敎信徒，又是抗戰主將，所以在廣西回漢的團結的精神，更為和諧，我當時送的祝詞是：</p>
<p>信徒四千五百萬，同胞不分回漢、</p>
<p>創造中華大民族，一心一德打勝仗，</p>
<p>廣西對于文人的態度，也値得談談。有些人以為廣西對文人，似乎太冷淡。這也有緣故，一是因為誤解，一是因為外來的文人，有些是發生問題。一位軍界的朋友對我說；「你看，那些知識分子，博士囉，學士囉，沒有打仗，便拚命鼓吹打仗，現在打起仗來，他們便從上海遊到南京，從南京遊到漢口，從漢口遊到重慶，遊到貴陽遊到桂林，吃不得苦，只好又遊回上海。法學博土法子多，立法當作把戲要，使得自已不必當兵，又使兒子不必當兵，死的只是農人，這是太不公平。」他這番話是眞括，但是夾了一點誤解。那些遊來遊去的文人，是不是就是鼓吹抗戰的文人，這是應當分辨的。可是廣西對于遊來遊去的文人，實在是看得太多，有些討厭了。特別的是女文人或是文女人：據着頭髮，穿着高跟鞋，把嘴唇塗得血紅，臉兒擦得雪白，這樣的女性是不是于廣西有益，對于廣西的鄉下姑娘。是不是可以把他們帶好了，我們外江老的文人也得反省二下。廣西不但是有點懷疑外省遊來遊去的文人，並且對于本省高談闊論，空嘴講白話的智識份子，也不見得優待。一次一些學生跑到鄉下去演講，考百姓對他們說，年紀靑靑的怎麼不去打仗，倒有空聞給我擊談。我的兒子是春天就去打日本×了。你們為什還不去啊？</p>
<p>我們外江人到廣西去的責任，倘使不能對廣西有貢獻，也應當把廣西的好的東西學一點來。我們也决不能因為廣西對子遊來遊去的文人冷淡，便說廣西不注重文化。我知道，外來的技術人才，是特別的重視，薪水比省主席還多。他們對于孩子劇團，新安旅行團，和金山領導的上海救亡劇團第二隊，是多未與高彩烈的歡迎啊！</p>
<p>整个的廣西，是獻給中華民族了。他把四十萬兵獻了出來，把兵工廠獻了出來，把一千多萬白銀獻了出來，把幾十萬乃至幾百萬的遊擊隊都要獻出來。我們跟着廣西這樣的把自已獻給中華民族，那我們是一定可以在蔣委員長領導之下，把日本國主雜打出去，而且還可以把一個自由平等的中華民國創造起來！</p>

<p>【海通社倫敦十六日電】英國政界對于法國致日本照會、深信英美法在不久之將來、定有實行聯合應付日本之表示、查法國之照會、亦與英國于前日所發出者雷同、要求日本將其對中國之計劃說明、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十六日電】『伯明罕郵報』今日稱、「英國送達日本之牒文、實為政治上第一重要之公文、此牒文無任何柔弱之表示、亦不允有辯論之餘地、此牒文視違背九國公約、致直接損害中國、並不次於列强利益之間接受損、此點殊可欣慰日政府相信英美兩國不致有積極行動、實屬不智也、」</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>震驚世界的英國致日牒文</h3>
<p>「英國致日牒文，將震驚世界」這不祇是英國與論界的評詞，而且是可能的事實。</p>
<p>英國這次牒文，於上星期六日由英駐日大使克萊琪送交日外務省。這個牒文指出日師首相近衛於十二月三日與廿二日聲明及外相有田于十二月十九日對報界談括，雖聲明日人在中國無領土野心，但事實上日本以武力强迫中國人民降服，，為英國政府所不能理解，所以英國政府應當盡力維護九國公約的尊嚴。</p>
<p>日本侵略者在遠東的猖狂，一方面以武力壓迫中國降服，摧毀人類文化，一方面並破壞英美各國權益，破壞世界和平。英國政府這種斥責日方的牒文，如能出諸『九一八』當時，則今日局面，自當大不相同。然而英政府終於有此牒文，果能繼之以堅决的實力支持，對於未來時局，仍有非常重大的决定作用。因為第一，英政府這一牒文已就目前事實，駁斥日方所謂對華無領土野心，並嚴正聲明『英國對於憑武力造成的新局勢，决不接受。』表示英國對於援華制日將採取更强的積極的步驟。第二是這一牒文的內容與措辭，與美國對日通牒完全一樣，表示英國政府將與美國政府最近反法西斯反侵略政策，採行共同行動。</p>
<p>英國這一牒文，旣含有上述兩點重大意議，則不僅對於日本侵略者，是一個重大的打擊，因其同時又是羅欺福總統對法西斯侵略者的警告的第一個有力的響應，則對於德　兩國，亦有重大的警告作用。反轉來說，對於中國以致英法廣大人民，則將是無可比喻的熱烈的歡忭與擁護，因為這正是中國，英法兩國，以至全世界和平正義人士共同的要求。</p>
<p>國聯行政院正在開會，我們應該喚起全體代表對於這個國際新形勢的認識、接受我國要求制裁日×的提案和西班牙人民共和政府的呼籲，應該成立更有力更澈底的保障國際正義的决定。</p>
<h3>「振濟新原則」</h3>
<p>本報十六日重慶專電稱，振委會連日會議，决定振濟新原則，要點是「凡後方失業及貧苦者，與前綫難民同樣救濟」。這本是去年國民黨臨全大會所訂『抗戰建國綱領』中已規定的原則，到現在始能準備實際施行，雖嫌為時太晚，但當此軍政民運諸端更始之際，確是令人欣慰的好消息。我們希望政府當局秉持『抗戰時期實行民生改善』的至善之策，適應各地及各種特殊需要，着着付諸實施，則對於民衆參加抗戰熱忱與生產熱忱的鼓勵，將有非常重大的效果。同時希望各地輿論界及專門人才，協助政府宣傳解釋，對於如何救濟後方失業者貧苦者與前綫難民，擬具詳細辦法，於消極的救濟之外，特別注重於把他們積極地組織到戰時生產機構中間去。庶與抗戰建國前送更有裨益。</p>

<h3>粵港青年會</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>隨軍服務團出發授旗禮　願優秀青年繼續上前線服務</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>前天晚上，自七時半至十一時許，靑年會的健身房充盜着熱和力的對流。記者覺得用什麼「熱血奔流」「脈膊跳動」一類的形容詞，還不能寫出這個隨軍服務團出發授旗典禮的眞實盛况。這樣的一個場面，只有用有聲電影全盤掃出才能够使沒有親自　加盛會的人，看了會相信我們香港的僑胞是愛國的，中國是不會亡的又一個眞憑實據。</p>
<p>各界的贈旗大大小小，足足有三十多面，配着花花綠綠的縐紙隨風飄動。籃球架上懸着大幅的國族。在總理遺像的兩　掛着這樣的對聯：「到前線去，為浴血戰士而服務」；「捐輸物質，因國家抗戰而犧牲」。樓上樓下，男男女女，老老小小，把這個莊嚴堂皇的會塲擠滿起來。</p>
<p>驀地裏，明亮的燈光熄滅了，對於黑暗的降臨，大家都驚異着，恐怖着。端詳一下，才知道一把熊熊的火炬，帶領二十三個雄糾糾的武裝男女靑年「踏踏踏……」地向會塲的正中進來。電光復明了，一陣陣歡迎致敬的掌聲雷動了很久的時間。</p>
<p>唱國歌行體如儀後，何明華會督禱告祝福，在塲場有好幾位西人參加，國際友人的同情，當然是使我們非常感激致開會詞是該團主席林子豐，大意是說：「二百多萬的將士為保衛國家而拚命，後方民衆出動服務是責無旁貸。靑年會出發了第一二隊隨車服務團到葉肇，吳奇偉，商震等部隊服務，幹過設官軍俱樂部，服務傷兵，敎導後方，民衆與兒童，宣傳，救護……等工作。現在軍事當局已撥了二十幾萬士兵為本團服務的範圍，現在冉出發第三四隊到前綫服務，還是不够的，希望繼續有第五，六，七，八隊出發服務，用民衆的汗，匯合將士的血，一定可以把握着最後的勝利」。聽到了勝利，個個都鼓掌起來。</p>
<p>宣誓之後，就是華商總會副主席黃茂林授旗，並代表香港各界訓詞。接着。就是全體歌詠全國總動員，個個人都忘記了自己，恨不得立刻奔到前綫去。</p>
<p>贈旗禮開始首先是聯靑社華南區總裁蔣法賢贈旗，接着，就是各團體，各學校相繼致贈物品，掌聲一陣陣又是雷鳴起來。這些物品實在是表現後方民衆無限的敬意。</p>
<p>演講的有該團主席譒聚東，及嶺大校長李應林。李校長講到：「……前此廣州靑年到車站，歡迎將土上前線時，將士們說：「受了這　的歡送，死亦抵了」！現在上前線去服務，一定竟可以鼓勵士氣……大家都覺得我們軍民應該緊緊聯在一起，互相感動，互相勗勉</p>
<p>這次培道中學在校長鼓勵之下，有三個同學和一個窒軍敎練參加隨軍服務團，主席為了獎勵與激揚，特地請該校校長溫耀斌登檯演講，全場又是報以熱烈的掌聲，一個合理的社會，應該是這樣擁戴對社會有勞績的人；每個人在社會上所獲得的榮譽，亦應該是這樣以對社會的貢獻為基礎。這種善惡的標凖是値得提倡的。記者在鼓掌中，希望能够鼓出多幾位這樣的校長出來。</p>
<p>體節繼續下去，就是該團長鄧錦輝致答詞，靑年會小組聯合歌詠班，和其他歌詠團歌詠，全塲空氣是嚴肅，緊張，活潑。靑年會幹事趙甘霖在報告中，還介紹這次將要領隊北上的鄧輝祥隊長的老太太出來給大家鼓掌致敬。鄧隊長很有體貌地向全體見禮道謝。鄭老太太和藹慈祥，嘗語記者謂：「國家到了這步田地，議他去做國家的兒子，便是了。國强才有家，我年老不中用，只有希望兒子去為國出力……」在場聽者，正不深受感動而肅然致献。這個活生生的「故事」要是給陶行知先生知道了，他一定又來做「香港的趙老太太」的新詩了。</p>
<p>接着，就是該團全體團員的表演，所表演的內容。就是該團將要帶到前線為將士服務的種種技衛。第一是歌詠，連合唱了七八支救亡歌曲。都很雄壯，激昂。尤其是「中國不會亡」的歌詞來得更淸楚，暸亮，是感人最深的一曲。第二是幻術，司儀者在請樓上和左右兩邊的觀衆不要見笑表演的秘密的時候，引得全場哄然大笑。第二是救護表演，各部份的綁帶衛和救急的表演都很準確，敏捷，最末是戲劇，表演「盲啞恨」。雖然飾啞巴的太不嚴肅，遠背劇情，可是老頭，四鳳，醉漢，觀衆甲乙都表現得很逼眞，生動，大體上算是成功。××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××」！大家一連高喊了好幾遍，掌聲又是雷動，在道敵愾同仇，愛國情緒高漲中，全體又一齊歌詠「保衛中華」，這眞是心歡裏發出來的呼聲，在熱和力對流着的周遭中，個個人的熱血是急促的奔流，脈是急劇的跳動。</p>
<p>在悠揚雄壯的音樂聲中，大家在出塲之前，紛紛把身十所有的鈔票，角子，銅板，投到慕捐箱裏去，藉以充實該團出發北上的費用。在還裏沒有荒淫，有的是嚴肅；沒有吝嗇，有的是慷慨；沒有卑怯，有的是勇敢；沒有頹廢，有的是緊張；沒有暮氣，有的是活潑。……像這樣的塲面在國內，在華僑中，當然還有很多很多。但是我們希望這一類偉大的事蹟源源發生起來，中華民族是新生了。</p>
<p>最末，謹以高慶的熱情，向粵港靑年會隨軍服務團致民族解放的敬禮，並祝為國珍重！</p>
<h3>中國工業合作協會代表報告　戰時的後方工業　全國劃分三大工業區已獲相當成績　在港設工業區辦事處發展西南工業</h3>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>蔣委員長在論長期抗戰時說過：「長期抗戰最後勝利之爭取，必須全民動員，除了軍隊補充外，更要注意產業的開發，使軍隊作戰所需要的一切。軍需品工業，均能自給。中國工業過去為畸形發展，多集中沿海市鎮，而現在則大部陷落×手；無工業不能作戰，亦不能成為一自由自立的國家；所以中國為支持長期抗戰，為樹立戰後經濟基礎，必須於戰時建立新工業。」</p>
<p>中國工業台作協會是根據蔣委員長上述意見而　生，本年七月間在西北區陝西的寶鷄縣正式成立第一個辦事處，在行政院孔院長的裁培下，逐漸發揚光大。繼續成立的有東南（鄂），西南（湘），及西北（川）三個辦事處。它的基金是五百萬元，經常費是　年五十萬元，完全是由行政院補助的。在這　偉大的組織下，他們的希望，是將來共有三萬顆果子。</p>
<p>為使希望成為事實，他們的一位幹員盧廣僑先生，及一位自願為我國　務的外國友人普義華德女士，已奉派於日前到達香港，與本港各救濟團體，互商聯絡，籌備在珠江流域設立辨事處。</p>
<p>婦女慰勞會首港分會、為使社會人士明瞭中國工合作社之組織，昨日下午三時，特柬請紳商鉅賈，會集於華商俱樂部，介紹與盧普兩先生相見，並請盧氏報告，「中國工業合作協會創辦起源與經過，及今後之進行」。到會的人士共有三十餘人，華人代表羅旭和，羅文錦，會督何明華，也會加道一個盛會，可見本港僑胞對此種組織的重視。</p>
<p>盧廣棉先生的一副健碩的身材，褐色的面孔，隱舍着精幹的精神。經主席何艾齡女士介紹之後，他開始報告。據稱：這個偉大的組織的起源，固然是根據蔣委員長的意見，同時他們幾位創辦者，於織之前，也看準了幾個將來必能成功的條件：（一）由淪陷區退出的難民和技衛工人，隨處皆是，正可利用來從事生產，（二）內地各種工業品的原料。如棉紗，毛，皮等。俱無銷路，價格低落不堪，而同時各種工業成品，反昂貴驚人，正可利用這些原料來製造工業品；（三）工業品在市塲上沒有舶來品的競爭，正應趁此時機，建立中國新工業的基礎。於是這個工業合作社，就在此抗戰期間，不避艱難困苦地產生出來！</p>
<p>中國工業合作社的使命，就是要在長期抗戰的過程中，增加後方生產，樹立戰後工業基礎，以爭取最後勝利，并建設平等自由的新中國。成立以來，相繼在湖南，江西，四川，和陝西，設置西南，東南，華西，和西北四個區辦事處，積極進行工作，西北區辨事處自去年八月下旬在　鷄成立以來，就着手分領調查地方原料及工業需要情形，收集難民，及失業工人，以及技術人員，來組織各種工業合作社。已組成的業有三十餘社，正在組織中還有三十幾社，除了各種輕工業外，我們更注意到小規模重工業的建立，像採煤，煉鐵，酒精，和三酸等工業，均正在分別計劃進行中</p>
<p>兩月來的經驗告訴我們：西北各種輕重工業的原料，產量，全很豐富，可惜貨棄於地，無人利用，現値我國抗戰已入第四階段，軍需工業品和後方T業品的需要，日益迫切，開發西北富源，實為刻不容緩，不過工業的部門太多，西北的幅員太大，T業建設這個重大均任務，絕不是少數人或是幾個公私團體所能元全祖當起來的。必須各方携起手來，羣策羣勵，方能希望在短期間內有所成就，所以我們希望社會各方面的人士，特別是具有技術經驗的專門人昌們，都能直接間接來參加這個鞏固後方經濟國防的工業合作運動，我們尤具盻望軍事機關地方當局，輿論界，金融界，都能各別的，積極的，對這個運動，予以必要的贊助和鼓勵！</p>
<p>在這裏我還有一點値得對大衆報告的，就是在組織的過程中，得到一位外國朋友艾黎先生的助力不少。艾黎先生是對我國最表同情的，它自動放棄了上海工部局的職務，來參加　一個組織，他認為這次的舉動，才算還了它日夜希望為我國服務的心願，他現在担任了總會的技術指導專員。</p>
<p>盧氏的報告是以國語及英語演出的，主席何艾齡女士，深恐聽衆，或有未明，還用粵語複述一次。據盧氏最後的表示，他很希望能在香港設立起一個工業區，使逃難來港的難民和失業工人來參加戰時生產，發展西南的工業，現在該協會在港工業區辦事處是設在婦女慰勞會裏面。</p>
<p>羅旭和爵紳，以首席華人代表的資格，代表全港僑胞對中國合作社祖織運動，表示萬二分贊同。他的意見是這個組織，旣可救濟難民失業，還可為中國復興的基礎，他說「何樂而不為」？對于盧先生說要在香港成立該協會工業區，更認為急切需要呢。</p>
<p>希望香港資產　級的僑胞，深切地認淸戰時工樂的重要，羣策羣力地把這個偉大的使命担負起來！</p>

<h3>統制黃金後穩定市場金價　防止黃金外流杜絕投機　直接增加我國外匯基金</h3>
<p>我國政府為防止黃金外流、杜絕投機計、實行黃金之統制、除頒布兌換法幣辦法外、並監督銀樓業收兌金類辦法、旨在穩定市塲金價、增厚外匯基金、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>穩定物價　戰後各地銀樓金店、利用時機、將金價時而抬高、時而抑低、故事放縱、藉圖私利、因此邇來內地金價、皆趨狂漲、其價格日有超過世界金價或杳港金價之上者、擾亂金融市塲、妨礙抗戰前途、莫過於此、今財政部所頒辦法、特定金飾價、以銀樓與中央銀行、或中交農三行公同商定之價値為準、旨在禁止任意抬高或任意抑低、藉以穩定市場金價、</p>
<p>增厚基金　財政部所頒辦法、規定全國所存之金條、金塊、金葉、沙金、礦金、及不具飾物形狀之金類、悉數售予中央銀行、直接增加外匯基金、間接即所以維護法幣信用、惟為顧全商民業務起見、仍准銀樓業繼續收進、成售出具飾物有器具形狀之赤金及九成金原金之業務、並得受中央銀行委託、代收不有師物器具形狀之金類、以及代收沙金、礦金等、</p>
<p>民間自由　中央對於國民節約運動、多所提倡、惟民間仍沿舊習、或以金類為飾物及各項器具、或以金類置諸窖藏及運往國外、實屬違背　約之原則、有妨抗戰前途之力量、政府規定民間所存不具有飾物器具形狀之金類、應悉數售交中央類銀行、至具有飾物器具形之金類、仍准民間自由向銀樓買賣、或加工改造、是於禁止現金逃避中、仍寓無背民間之習慣之意、</p>

<h3>麗華杯足球初賽　西員陣線已確定　與前擬定的略有變更</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】六項錦標之一的麗華杯、初賽定本月廿一（星期六）廿二（星期日）兩天舉行、</p>
<p>廿一日西文負聯隊對陸軍聯隊、地點九龍會塲、廿二日華人聯隊對海軍聯隊、地點香港曾場、俱下午三時半開賽、</p>
<p>此項乃採淘汰制、比賽時間九十分鐘、如賽完規定時間、尙未分勝負、則延長二十分鐘、</p>
<p>過去十四屆、西文員奪標七次、陸聯四次、華聯三次、</p>
<p>去屆華隊原有包辦六項錦標的可能、可惜在麗華杯决賽時、華聯因健將不齊、給陸聯所敗、</p>
<p>本星期日華聯對海聯的初賽、華職方面、因南華征實、未及趕返、故日前所决定的陣綫、實覺美中不足、而且目下海聯人材濟濟、實力極强、誠恐華聯此次遭遇、凶多吉少、</p>
<p>足球總會「生意眼」要緊、對華聯陣綫、亦表示不滿、雖南華已急電西貢請兵、但能否撥調數員趕囘應戰、尙成問題、</p>
<p>西文員代表、日前已由總會與此隊有關的各委員會商擬出、並分別徵求與有關係的各該會之意見、如無異議、便算作實、擬出的陣綫如下、</p>
<p>高路斯（香港會）</p>
<p>畢力般（警察會）　雷米迪（聖約瑟）</p>
<p>衣史杜蘭治（香港會）　卑利士（九龍會）　挪夫（響察會）</p>
<p>廖亞臣（九龍會）　侯律（警察會）　李安納（聖約瑟）　佐芝（九龍會）　地派路（警察會）</p>
<p>聖約瑟的雷米迪、與大告山奴及比路度同一樣的態度、除了代表葡萄牙出席國際賽及替聖約瑟作聯賽及特別銀牌賽外、其他任何比賽、均不參加、所以、西文員的正式陣　、無一約瑟球員、名列榜上、警察的畢力般、又因足傷未克入於正選、祗居後備之列、經商討後的西文員正式陣　如下、</p>
<p>高路斯（香港會）</p>
<p>烏列芝（九龍會）　帕架（警察會）</p>
<p>韓尼波（九龍會）　卑利士（九龍會）　挪夫（警察會）</p>
<p>廖亞臣（九龍會）　侯律（警察會）　阜拉（香港會）　佐芝（九龍會）　地派路（香港會）</p>

<h3>昨宵女子籃球賽　西南竟壓倒華僑　梅芳自得兩分南華勝雪花</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）自從梅芳對道培的主力戰在去星期六舉行後、健身室卽漸　地冷落了、到了昨宵、按表本有三場舉行、在後因為港大棄權、結果只有兩幕而巳、</p>
<p>在戰神上還未駕臨之前、一般人對首塲的勝負、都肯定地斷西南不是華僑對手、但經過了一番劇烈的攘奪後、西南竟一華僑壓倒、</p>
<p>第一節始、華僑先取攻勢、素貞、蟬　相繼犯規、穎琪打開紀錄、守光罰中一球、三對〇佔先、掌聲四起、瞬眼問惠貞犯規被罰、纖纖囘報一點、此後守光雖有所獲、但瑞心、織機、頻還顏色、戰至一節終成七比七、</p>
<p>再戰僑華攻勢頓挫、西南屢藉罰球之便、績分增進不已、這節華僑除由守光得囘兩個罰球之後、即望籃與嘆、一無所獲、反視西南配枝、纖纖、瑞心、演來都是有聲有色、廿二比九後、二節卽完、</p>
<p>下半塲雙方都極努力、爭奈榮棠缺塲、守光失去老拍　、獲球比校困難、故這節守光雖然頻頻得手、但因二節損失過多、得不慣失、故是節乃不免以廿二對三十居下風、</p>
<p>末節始、華僑仍然掙扎、瞬眼間、守光又中一隻、廿四些三十、績分已很接近、西南各將為略避鋒芒起見、一度叫停、果然經過這一陣休態後、鐵繼演出甚為可觀、在投必中、如得神助、配校、瓖心、更左右扶持、績分續有加增、這樣直至完場笛鳴、三十六比廿六、華喬喪師而、</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……社會暴徒</p>
<p>The　Last　Gangster</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱孫、扮演一個為非作歹的暴徒、在他過往作品中的成功、証明他是一個傑出的人才、他那出神入化的演技、刻畫人　的性格表演、博得了每一偭觀衆異口同聲的讚許、</p>
<p>在本片中、他再飾一個無惡不作的暴徒、殺人越貨頑視國法、更操縱着整個社會的惡勢力、叱咤風雲、驕橫放縱、不可一世、而終為者賢妻愛子的緣故、犧牲一切、以及自己的性命、得到一個極港慘的下場、</p>
<p>愛德華在本片中的寅技、處處迸着大才的火花、有着一種非常的動人力量、合演的有詹姆史帶華　絲史屈東、同時在本片中、我們還看到好萊塢一張最完美的賊匪演員表、這一部「社會暴徒」中所有的緊張動人的倩節將給與觀衆大量而强烈的新刺激、</p>
<p>皇后……漁船戰血</p>
<p>Spawn　of　tne　North</p>
<p>一部由文學名著改編的電影、描寫美國北部邊境、北冰洋上阿拉士加半島、島上漁民的生活碰那裏是大量一三文　」的出產地、但以捕魚謀生的漁民們、卻須以絕大的努力去戰勝一切天浮為人類的困難、像飄海面然的冰山、漁賊的猖狂等來維時他門的利益　在地們充滿着悠歌憎愛的生活中、有着不少動人心腸的故事了</p>
<p>本片的攝影技術、活潑巧妙、還有幾個印第安人祭議典禮的鏡頭、在我們來看、是充滿　神秘的意味的、同時本片擁有五個　星、情節的編排、使每人都有儘量發揮藝術天才的機會、導演亨利夏桑活、　導演過「松嶺恩仇記」和「抗敵英魂」等片、對於本片的情節及高潮點的處理、很有操縱觀衆情緒的力量、</p>
<p>平安……俠兄破賊記</p>
<p>North　of　the　Rfo　Grande</p>
<p>是威廉杯繼「俠友戲賊記」之後的作品、同是描寫美國西部俠客加薛地的故事、這一次是因為他的兄弟被劫匪槍殺、在法庭上未能伸冤、加薜地報仇。切、扮作睹棍、混跡諸窟、暗中偵查眞兇、經過再三的險阻、方得為弟報仇、并代西部除一大害、情節相當曲折、威廉杯在本片中、也有敎上片更精彩的演出、</p>
<p>東東……馬場三怪</p>

<p>Moonlfght　Sonata</p>
<p>是一部音樂愛情片、値得注意的就是有所負盛名的鋼琴家彼得魯斯基、Paderewski、全片結構、皆以彼得魯斯基的鋼琴演奏作為故事中心、在音樂會中、他那出神入化的藝術、感動了全塲的聽衆、尤其是一對靑年夫妻、經聽衆要求而再奏「子夜琴聲」一曲、接着他口述一對靑年夫婦怎樣在愛情破裂的時候、　「子夜琴聲一」曲所感化、重好如初、也就是本片的故事、</p>
<p>彼得魯斯基的藝術、値得歡賞外、情節上在　出上則略據沉悶、對白多於動作、晚不了英國片的作風、却爾斯福雷、已失却當年瀟酒　采、</p>
<p>景星……西線間諜網</p>
<p>Lancer　Spy</p>
<p>一般的間諜活動影片、全片缺乏緊張空氣、而沉悶、除後半部那英國間諜盜得軍情後設法逃避幾幕、還算生動、兩主角演出也平平</p>
<p>中央……話劇</p>

<h3>世界和平消遣圖</h3>
<p>— 子由</p>
<p>為了好奇心的驅使，便也擠到人群裏去看看那掛在騎樓桂上的圖畫。起先還以為是甚麼「美人春睡」或是「防空常識」之類，但不對，是「世界和平消遣圖」啦！我們實在比先前進步，已經從個人的享樂，注意到國家的安全，又進而想到世界的和平。是的，生括在這樣的時代，這樣的地方，要不進步點（最少也得裝裝樣子），確實很難站得穩。</p>
<p>閑話少說，且先把「世界和平消遣圖」介紹給大家：這裏也許是什麼和平之宮吧，門口掛着萬國旗，王寵惠，張伯倫（想是哈里法克斯之悮？）李維諾夫，和宇垣（現在應該是有田了吧）在大廳打麻將，林主席和蔣委員在王外長後面，羅斯福在王外長與張伯倫之間，達拉第在李維諾夫的一旁，墨沙里尼和希特拉則站在宇垣的旁邊觀戰，這　麻將可眞厲害，贏起來大家都有幾番；可是張伯倫的一對南正對着宇垣的一對南，李諾維夫的白板也和宇　的相對，我們的主外長却以「滿湖」得到「最後勝利」。此外齊亞諸，匈牙利外長，和佛朗哥一夥在廳的角落：而加倫，李頓，和貝奈斯又在另一個圖的　下。這就是對於世界和平的消遣之全貌。</p>
<p>究竟香港是香港，中國是中國，前線和後方也是界限分明；不是前線的重慶已經有人跳舞，何況比後方　舒適而安全的香港。橫直有的是錢和時間，當然得找點消遺來打發日子。戲院，舞場不都是擠滿人？聽說還有人內感到「夜生活」的寂寞，而要設計來個遠東最大規模的「夜總會」。香港之大，當然容得下一張為消遺而畫的「世界和平消遺圖」。</p>
<p>可是把世界和平當作消遺，未免太使我們的張伯倫先生難堪。也把世界和平為人類謀永久幸福的積極意義弄得太滑稽化了；而把中華民族的為自身獨立，自由，幸福，世界的永久和平而戰，看作孤注一擲的互睹國運。也有點講不過去。</p>
<p>電影界的掃除運動經已一再為人提出，與論界的除好軍動這幾天也正在加緊工作，但對子和大衆很親近的街頭掛圖，和一切含着毒素。最為兒童所愛看的連環圖，我們也得來一番淸除。</p>
<p>含着毒素的「世界和平消遺圖」，旣然可以掛在街頭而得到許多觀眾。我們為什麼不可以繪一幅正確的，積極的「世界和平圖」呢？這也是我們所不能放鬆的工作呀。</p>
<h3>鄉之懷愁</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>窗外的野葡萄架，已經完全腿去了靑春少艾的裝飾，牆脚下隱藏着茂綠蒲葵葉，已經轉成枯黃，雖然是南海上的季節，但秋天的憂鬱色調，顯然渲染了島上的一切緣物。</p>
<p>我的故鄉，如今恐怕已經是深秋了罷。</p>
<p>時光總是快得像箭火，遠離東北教鄉恰是七個年頭了。囘想着去年初春的時節。在寗靜的古城中，接得遙遠家鄉的書信，父親還是殷勤地說「你離開家巳經有六年了；我們在這裏一天比一天覺得××國的壓迫加甚，恐怕我們沒有相見的日子了。」我知道每天日日倚閭望歸的老母，並父親，為了這下半世再不能得見的兒子。不知費了多少的心思，想得一見。其實關山並沒有阻隔了我們，遙遠的道路，也沒有割斷我們的思念的交流，但那荼毒的惡勢力，和沾着血的手却障住了一切交往。「不要回來罷，我們對你放心」。像這樣的話也是在父親的信與寫着：「雖然我們不能用手觸着你。額胸貼近你。但——我們是放心的。一在這行字跡的下面，却有眼淚污濕的痕迹，而污濕最多的却是在：「我們要你也相信，我們一切都是平安幸福」的一行之下。呵，我知這，憑我枯　的想像我的故鄉恐怕已經是大改景象了罷。</p>
<p>我古樸可愛的故鄉呵，我怎能將你從我的胸懷記憶抹去呢？我追念昔日，當我在遼河上度着美妙甜蜜的童年，在渾啊上長成結實的靑年，在潦陽憑了黃昏，聽着敵人在日本站上吹奏着的軍角，度過學生時代，在荒遠的絕塞上又消磨了我七個年頭，昔日的足迹　痕，這時　成了我心頭上陣陣作　的創作，如果說往年是幸福的，那麼今時的憶念，眞的沒有甚麼冉酸心苦口的味道，和這想念之酸苦來比凝了</p>
<p>是前七年的夏天，父親在瀋陽的車站送我，在到車站之　他是十分剛毅地勸慰我說：</p>
<p>「你去罷，沒有什麼可牽掛的？」</p>
<p>那是正在家園的籬笆陰下，我們是並坐在潮濕而帶着新鮮味道的士地上。東北甯靜地鄉景，使我們更追念着早些日子的物阜民豐的好時候。我們的四圍滿了蟬聲，從遠處還有菜園子裏打水的淸歌聲。</p>
<p>父親說：「你可以放心地去，幾次地我已經禱告了，神一定會護佑你的。」說完了他又帶我跪下禱告。</p>
<p>但在車站裏，在行人紛擾的月台上，他的眼睛都濕了，他說：</p>
<p>「真的，去不去，都沒有什麼關係，這個年頭兒。」</p>
<p>我看出來，他的心變得鬆軟了。</p>
<p>車已經慢慢走起來，但他依然追上幾步，揮着手說：</p>
<p>「記着寫信，記着。」</p>
<p>不做奴隸的烽火，是將我們的中間的距　又引長了，最可痛心的竟是在蘆溝橋響起砲火之前，他却離開了隷的地帶，一生受着壓迫創傷的心，却飛到另一間自由的國土，如今，家鄉故園雖然是距我們申遠了，但在另一方面看，我們離東北故鄉却是步步逼近了。</p>
<p>在這裏很少遇見面貌相識的故人，更聽不見用着鄉音的鄉談，只藉着這秋色漫野的　條景色，或可能再重憶起故鄉昔日的景象。</p>
<p>廣闊平坦的東北大野呵在我的記憶中冉展開你的容顏，讓我嗅着新穀的香氣，甘草的芳香，在憶想中重踏上鄉土任情遊覽一下。</p>
<h3>一個甜蜜的吻</h3>
<p>— 東江</p>
<p>讓我擁抱着你吻你的顏面，</p>
<p>我願你從此在人生的途上，</p>
<p>永遠不再憂悶纒綿。</p>
<p>把你靈敏銳利的眼光向下看；</p>
<p>打起　獨一般的意志，</p>
<p>不要怕那荊棘，重疊的關山；</p>
<p>不要怕×人的高射砲和野蠻。</p>
<p>愛的！我的心！</p>
<p>很激動地和你離別。</p>
<p>但當我們全民還沒有得着自由的時，</p>
<p>我願你在機翼下，</p>
<p>永遠地使着×人流鮮血！</p>
<p>願你忘記了一切，</p>
<p>駕機飛去！</p>
<p>我會安慰你老邁的母親；</p>
<p>撫　你幼　的孩子：</p>
<p>和看守你的田園　會…</p>
<p>你去吧！你去吧！</p>
<p>願你忘了一切。</p>
<h3>在轟炸下成長在大火中壯健</h3>
<p>— 王坪</p>
<p>長沙兒童劇團在衡陽</p>
<p>四月十日，敵人的炸彈在長沙開了花；湖南大學及及大部街道　滅了，可是却結了個鮮艷的果——長沙兒童劇團就在這時開成立大會。</p>
<p>他們的成立，是受了孩子劇及新安旅行團工作的激刺；「在戰區的小朋友都組織起來了，我們後方的兒童實在不應該不動」，他們的團長何麗小姐告訴我；「於是，由田海男——田海男你曉得嗎？田漢先生的兒子——同我幾　個人發動了組織兒童團體……」這　中經過的艱辛，自然與其他的團體的成長一樣。但是主小孩的努力大大的協助下，終於在鳥煙烈焰中誕生。</p>
<p>我們是從幾歲到十幾歲的兒童……在我們小小的年紀，日本强盜的侵略戰爭便加到我們的頭上……失掉了家園，喪失了父母，折散了兄弟姐妹；有的喪了生命，有的成了殘廢，有的隨同父母作了流亡的難民，有的被×據去；其餘沒被殺戮的，也隨時時有被×人轟炸的可能。……要阻止×人凶橫，就只有全上下國，地無分南北，人無分老幼的起　抗戰。我們年紀雖小，但是我們有愛國的熱情，有救國的壯志，只要我們團結起來，我們會產生强大的力量……所以我們組織這一劇團，準備用我們的天眞和熱情，通過戲劇，激發我們的父母，叔伯，姑嫂，兄弟，姐妹們的愛國情緒，共同來抗戰建國……「這動人的宣言，隨着他們工作的開展，普遍地展開在人的眼前；在他們另一個文件裏又遭樹寫着：「以實際的工作，去接受實用的敎育，改良生活，自已訓練自已，敎育自已」。的話，這充分的表現了他們的正確性。</p>
<p>剛成立不久後，便作了一次空前的工作：那就是七月十二日，在長沙與兒童戰時服務團為捐助難童的聯合公演。收入一千五百元，悉數捐給湖南兒童保育會。完全由孩子主動，而採取聯合音樂戲劇各團體的形式演出，且收得巨大的欵項，正如抗戰日報記者說的：「這是一個創舉是由于兒童的天眞，沒有「分歧的政見，」只知埋頭工作的」收澳。</p>
<p>之外，他們每週必廣播一次話劇或歌曲。所廣播的劇本，差不多都是他們自已作的共有五個之多。</p>
<p>這還是前三個月的事。</p>
<p>一後來因田海男到西川去了，小朋友們有的隨家庭離開長沙，或者跟學校到了鄉下，同時」，何團長說到此地特別加重語調說，同時我們的團址也遭到殘酷的轟炸，所有用心血換來的用具全部燬滅，我也到洛陽服務去了，就這樣兒童劇團無形中呈着死的狀態；可是，這死不過是工作的停頓吧了，大家還是希望他的復活，努力進行使他復活的工作。……不然，為甚麼有今天呢？</p>
<p>粵漢路的兩頭失守，但粵漢路心臟的長沙，頓時換了面目，浮動緊張，人們也有了新的認識，再不努力的話，魔手馬上就可伸到心臟了，于是兒童劇團的主幹開始新的活動，何麗也從洛陽歸來。也是在小孩努力大人的協助下恢復了，而且團員中有了甄別，經織也有了更適合工作的變動，因為他們準備萬一時，像孩子劇團新安旅行團以的到處工作。可是經費沒有出處工作還不能開展：</p>
<p>正在進行軍委會政治部的關係時，長沙大火的慘劇開演了，他們準備的百萬一時間到來了，而政部的大先生們，便叫我們塔着他們後撤的軍用車到了衡陽，而且，答應暫時給我們每月二百元的津貼，看將來的工作，再决定我們的命運。何小姐侃侃地，以他善於表達意思的詞藻談着。</p>
<p>在生活方面，不用何小姐談，我已知道得異常的淸楚。第一天給我的印象，便是『下一代比我們强』，　們在五點鐘—天還不大亮時，便由値日官吹哨子起身，起身後，馬上整理好床舖便開早會。「主席我有點意見」。</p>
<p>『主席他的話不對，應該要……。』</p>
<p>『我們吃飯要節省，多將錢用在工作上』這此話實在使人不相信他們是十幾歲的孩子，早會後便是練音，唱歌，……才洗臉，洗臉一律用冷水，牙膏是幾個入共用一瓶，飯後，便隊出發工作；寫標語，推銷票子（為徵募棉被公債的戲票）……集體生活，集體學習，集體工作，在集體中，他們鍛鍊成一羣的戰士。</p>
<p>『你不要以為小孩好管，何小姐繼續地說』；在純潔這一點，確是好的，可是，在中國過去的社會及敎育下，們他也長成些壞的習氣，例如風頭主義吧，他們也是有的，如果你太讓他們自由發展了或太誇獎他們了，他們會養成驕傲……</p>
<p>「管來不是壓制，放縱不是發展」，記者揷了這麼一句。</p>
<p>何小姐又接着說：我現在最感到困難的是沒有帮手什麼事都要我一個人幹，我希望在新幹部未出現前，你們能時常帮助我，隨時灌輸他們的政治認識敎他們點工作技術……</p>
<p>十幾個小朋友我都同他們個別談過話，每個人那有差不多的認識，每個人有自已的特長，有一個十四歲的朋友，寫得一手好宇，有一個會畫漫畫，有一個特別學着名曲家孫愼的指揮法……特別是有一個小朋友家庭三番五次叫他回去父親祖母自來叫他，他都婉言勸囘了，他說，呌回去，無非是讀書，是過安逸日子，其實在團體裏面，不是在讀書嗎？而目讀的是實用的書，過的生活比家中還快活，要呌我孝順你們　，我也不會替你們做什麼事？救國不是更重要嗎？國家强了，不就報了你們養育兒子的恩嗎？你們年紀都比我大，難道沒有淸楚？家人弄得沒法，只好騙他說：你囘家，一次再來吧。可是，到家門，他馬上又跑回了團體。我一想起這事，使我更堅定把兒童劇團弄健全的心」。何少姐興奮地說。</p>
<p>現在，兒童劇團奉了政治部的命令，到桂林去了，聽說，要將他們同孩子劇團合併。何小姐對我說，要合併，朋友都不大贊成。因為合併的理由，說是人太少不充分，如果經費多一點，我人自然要擴充工作能力然更大了。現在我們决定：（一）如果把孩子劇團編為第一隊，我們第二隊，可以，不然，（二）請給予津貼，（三）都不行的話，我們仍然恢復以前的工作方式：以工作來爭取生存。…這，我們已經寫信給田漢處長了。</p>
<p>統一是必要的，但，統一消滅別人就不大妥。這是結論。</p>
<p>他們昨天去了，衡陽各界在徵募棉被的大會中，得他們不少的帮助，給他們無限的同情。願他們堅强壯大起來。</p>

<h3>行軍瑣記</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>而在官長們的心里，眼看病號加多，天天在暗自搖頭，當幾個官長到一起的時候，這句話就一定不知不覺地被說了出來：</p>
<p>「眞糟，又恢復江西時代的情形了。」</p>
<p>在江西，那是從前的事情了，那時正在「國動」，弟兄們掛病號的一師人有三分之一。</p>
<p>現在，聽說隊伍要開拔，有些弟兄捕風捉影地知道是回河南老家，人人全樂得發狂甚而病號的病都因此好了七八分。</p>
<p>無論是師部直屬部隊和旅團營連，各處全在收拾行裝，作着出發的準備。二日到了，該出發了。我們的屋主人，—那七十多歲的老頭兒，終朝每日詞養雞鴨以消磨他的時問的，手里揮着一柄時刻不離的白鵝羽扇，打着細瘦的赤背，句我門關切也問道：</p>
<p>「同志們你們要開拔了？」</p>
<p>『是的』。　（未完）</p>

<h3>Launching the People's Movement in Guerrilla Areas</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance entered a new stage, the role of guerrilla warfare has become increasingly significant. The Military Affairs Commission issued a general order that "occupied areas" should uniformly be renamed "guerrilla areas," indicating that wherever the Japanese army has set foot, extensive guerrilla warfare should be launched. This is not merely a matter of changing names. Although guerrilla warfare is a military operation, it must be coordinated with the people's movement to succeed. The nature of guerrilla warfare is by no means the "wandering and looting" style of banditry that Wang Jingwei described. Instead, it is a surprise attack that can be launched anytime and anywhere. Without the integration of the military and the people, this task cannot be accomplished. Therefore, the term "coordination" is not sufficient; it should be said that the people's movement in the guerrilla area is even more important than military action.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's iron heels can only occupy "points" and "lines," not the entire "surface." Everyone understands this. However, in the so-called areas of points and lines, the "land" may be occupied, but the "people" have never been subjugated. Those who hold a mechanistic view believe that wherever the land has fallen, there are fundamentally no "people" left. When the army retreats, the people disperse in advance. When the army withdraws, the people also follow to the rear. What the Japanese army gains is scorched earth and empty cities, with no resources or people. Even those who remain are either the old and weak or traitors. However, the reality is not entirely like this. Except for a few transportation hubs, China is primarily an agricultural society. This is true for villages, and even those who live in cities are mostly landlords, small merchants needed by the agricultural society, and artisans. The people of an agricultural society are attached to their land and unwilling to leave their homes easily. Even if they painfully abandon their fields once, they will inevitably return home soon to resume their old occupations. Looking at the poems and writings of ancient poets and writers, all they do is shed tears upon hearing the cry of the partridge and think of home upon seeing the bright moon, rarely encouraging people to travel extensively. The Japanese army deeply understands this psychology. Therefore, after occupying a place and conducting searches and massacres, they deliberately show petty favors and implement "appeasement" work, recruiting people to return to their homeland from refuge elsewhere and return to the cities from the villages. Therefore, in places like the Jiangnan region, within three to four months after the occupation, sixty to seventy percent of the people had returned to their homes. These people are not traitors in the beginning, but they are forced by their livelihoods and the difficulty of living abroad to temporarily return to their homes and live a life of humiliation and endurance. The Japanese army considers this both a decorative item and a means of exploitation. They use traitors to encourage the resumption of business, run education, collect rents and taxes, and promote opium and gambling. They use both swords and poison, extracting wealth and also drugging the people, striving to achieve results beyond guns and bombs. This is also what they call the people's movement. People's hearts often crave immediate peace and forget long-term considerations. As time passes, impressions fade easily. The Japanese army's people's movement may not be effective now, but given time, it may conceal the traces of their brutality. Therefore, for the current plan, our government should strengthen the institutions of the people's movement in various occupied areas, educate the people, train the people, explain the greater cause, and state the advantages and disadvantages, so that they are not forced by circumstances or lured by benefits. Then these millions of people will not be used by the Japanese army at present, but will still be national treasures in the future. If our government relaxes on this, the Japanese army will reduce one point of resistance and increase one point of strength. The stakes are extremely high in this gain or loss. Therefore, I believe that even when there is no military action in the guerrilla area, the people's movement should still be a very important and regular task.</p>
<p>There are many methods of the people's movement, but they mainly consist of organization and training. The method of organization should take the form of secret societies, with relatively small units and widespread distribution, under the overall control of the political training personnel of the guerrilla隊. Other organizations such as religious groups and guilds should be fully utilized to maximize their effectiveness. In addition to the military training required for guerrilla warfare, the training method must also pay attention to general training. For the sake of being popular and easy to promote, it is possible to put forward a number of simple and feasible slogans as common beliefs for the general public, such as "Do not pay grain to the puppet organization," "Do not eat in the puppet organs," "Do not inform," "Do not go to the puppet yamen to file lawsuits," "Do not send children to puppet schools to study," "Do not buy and sell enemy goods," and "Do not take trains, ships, or cars in the guerrilla area unless necessary." In each small organization, members swear to each other by these creeds, adhering to them without falling. If there is a violation, the small organization will impose sanctions. This matter is extremely simple and easy. If it can be universally promoted, then the beautiful mountains and rivers will not actually fall. What the Japanese army occupies will not even be "points" and "lines."</p>

<h3>Acting and Being a Person</h3>
<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>—— Words of Instruction to Students of the Financial Personnel Training Institute ——</p>
<p>[Chongqing News] President Kong recently gave instructions to the students of the Financial Personnel Training Institute, listing the two major principles of financial personnel: acting and being a person. He elaborated in detail on the concepts and methods of financial management, based on theory and experience, and made many unique points. His encouragement of frugality and criticism of extravagance is particularly effective in the current deteriorating social environment. The full text is published below for our readers.</p>
<p>Dear faculty and staff, dear students, last time when I addressed everyone, I mentioned three key points to encourage and inspire you. That is, financial personnel must first emphasize both talent and virtue, second, establish integrity, and third, be loyal, intelligent, hardworking, and able to endure hardship. Today, I plan to say a few more words to everyone on the following two issues: first, the concept of financial management; second, personal cultivation. The former is the principle of financial personnel acting, and the latter is the principle of financial personnel being a person.</p>
<p>(A) The Concept of Financial Management</p>
<p>The necessary conditions for financial personnel are, of course, to have financial knowledge and financial skills. However, the basic concept of financial management must also be correct. If the concept is wrong, not only will financial management not be done well, but the impact will inevitably lead to national disaster. The most important of the basic concepts of financial management are the following two:</p>
<p>(First) Financial management should consider the people's strength and should not be exhaustive. If we want the national finance to be abundant, we must have prosperous tax revenue. To have prosperous tax revenue, we must cultivate the tax base. Therefore, those who are good at financial management do not focus on extortion as their ability, but rather on supporting the people's livelihood as their first task. We must understand that handling finance is not a matter of plunder, but rather of cultivation before harvest. Those who plunder wealth naturally take all the money away, leaving nothing behind. However, those who farm and produce would not do this. For example, when farmers cut chives, they always leave the roots so that they can grow again. If the roots are pulled out, there may be a little more harvest at one time, but they will not grow again in the future. There is a joke in a foreign country about a person who bought a goose that laid a golden egg every day. He calculated that this goose could lay more than three hundred golden eggs a year, but laying only one a day seemed too slow. Therefore, he wanted to cut open the goose's stomach and take out all the golden eggs at once. However, after cutting it open, there was only one golden egg in its stomach, and the goose died, and there were no more eggs afterwards. Therefore, we must consider the strength of the whole people and must not exploit them so thoroughly that the people have no room for recovery. After I took office as Minister of Finance, I convened a National Finance Conference. At the conference, I proposed abolishing all kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. At that time, the representatives of various provinces and cities all expressed agreement in principle on this issue, but when it came to practical implementation, everyone had difficulties. Because local budgets mostly rely on this income, once it is abolished, it will inevitably make the already strained local finances even more difficult to manage, and all government affairs will be in danger of stagnation. Therefore, some advocated for preservation, and some advocated for revision. After repeated explanations and the promise that the central government would appropriately subsidize local military and government expenses, a resolution was finally passed. In recent years, the total number of harsh and miscellaneous taxes that have been abolished in various provinces and cities has been more than fifty kinds. Of course, it is inevitable that many of them have duplicate names, but this shows how many types there were. As for the amount of taxes abolished, it totaled more than 60 million. At that time, some people laughed at me and said that when I took office, there were only three months of reserve funds in the national treasury, and various sources of income showed no signs of improvement. The central government could not even take care of itself, but instead subsidized the local governments, which was somewhat pedantic. However, they did not know that what I used was the method of sowing seeds, planting the seeds in the fields, and a greater harvest would naturally come in time. In recent years, the reason why finance has been able to improve day by day is not unrelated to this point. Wang Anshi said, "If you want to be sufficient in use, you must first manage finances." He also said, "Setting up officials to manage finances is not to satisfy private desires." The meaning is that the country must have reasonable income, taking what should be taken, and giving up what should not be taken, so as not to arbitrarily extort and risk losing the foundation of the country. All of you students will be civil servants handling finances in the future. The most important thing for civil servants is to recognize their own position. What is your own position? That is, on the one hand, to collect reasonable revenue for the country, and on the other hand, to support the people's strength. Not only to collect taxes, but also to cultivate the tax base.</p>
<p>Second, financial management must pay attention to the people's support. To govern, one must win the people's hearts. This is a basic condition in politics. Because the government is built on the people's trust, the government must seek the support of the people, and officials must seek the belief of the people. Then they can succeed in their duties. Being a financial person is not easy, because financial administration focuses on levying taxes and collecting donations, asking the common people for money. And on the people's side, no matter how patriotic they are, they always feel unhappy about tax collectors asking for money. Therefore, on the one hand, we must carefully perform our tax collection duties, and at the same time, we must be considerate of the suffering of the people, using the strength of the people as the standard for collection, and striving to make the burden fair and equitable so that the people have no complaints. This can be considered a person who is good at financial management.</p>
<p>(Second) Financial management should start with a broad vision and a focus on details. The so-called broad vision means to find ways to open up long-term sources of wealth, instead of being obsessed with petty calculations. In recent years, we have abolished harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies while opening up fair and universal taxes such as income tax and inheritance tax. This is the same principle. Ouyang Xiu said, "Governing should be lenient and simple, and things should not be neglected. The so-called leniency is to be not harsh and urgent, and the so-called simplicity is not to be complicated and trivial." These two words, leniency and simplicity, also mean to start with a broad vision. However, having a broad vision is not enough; we must also focus on details. That is, financial personnel must be careful and diligent in performing their duties, whether large or small. All public funds, even small amounts, must be turned over to the public. We must not neglect to collect them just because the amount is small. We must know that accumulating small amounts can make a fur coat, and constant dripping can form a vast ocean. National expenditures of hundreds of millions are also the result of accumulating small amounts. As for expenditures, we must be scrupulous in the use of public funds and must not be wasteful in the slightest. We should be diligent in daily affairs and never be careless, lazy, or negligent. Originally, financial administration is very complicated. Even a slight carelessness can lead to a hundred evils. Many of the long-standing malpractices of Chinese financial institutions are due to negligence in small matters. If small things can be done well, great things will naturally be achieved. The so-called "a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" is an inevitable principle.</p>
<p>Civil servants are representatives of the government and role models for the people. They occupy a position in society that influences the atmosphere. They must have a good cultivation of their own ideals and conduct in order to gain the trust of the people and enforce the law. The so-called "helping others to stand up after standing up oneself, and helping others to succeed after succeeding oneself" is what it means. Financial personnel are in charge of expenditures, and the good or evil of their personal behavior is related to the vital interests of the people. They must be upright and honest, and abide by the law in order to fulfill their duties. In the era of autocracy, there was a pavilion in the yamen of counties everywhere, called the Imperial Edict Pavilion. The four sentences written on it were: "Your salary and emolument are the fat and marrow of the people. The common people are easy to mistreat, but Heaven is hard to deceive." There were also three large characters in the middle: "Diligence," "Frugality," and "Caution." They told officials to know that their salaries were all from the fat and marrow of the people and that they should not deceive Heaven, break the law, or mistreat the people. Although China was a despotic political system in the past, there was still a kind of moral concept that bound people's hearts. The emperors also constantly reminded the people and admonished officials to serve the people with "Diligence, Frugality, and Caution." Although times are different now, these few words are still a maxim for officials. Therefore, today I plan to tell everyone these three words:</p>
<p>First, Diligence. The ancient saying goes, "Diligence can make up for clumsiness." It also says, "Proficiency comes from diligence, and neglect leads to waste." The ancients all took diligence as the first priority in managing their families and governing the country. Tao Kan of the Jin Dynasty carried hundreds of bricks into his room in the morning and hundreds of bricks out of his room in the evening, never stopping throughout the year. This was to practice the habit of diligence. In the past, emperors went to court at five in the morning, and ministers paid attention to grasping their hair and spitting out food. The place where the emperor worked was called the Diligence Hall. The spring and autumn suburban sacrifices required personal cultivation. All of this was to put effort into the word "diligence." China often says, "Not afraid of being slow, only afraid of standing still." With diligence, there is nothing difficult in the world. There is a European story about a tortoise and a rabbit racing. The rabbit thought it could run fast and was sure of victory, so it was careless. Halfway through, it found a shady lawn to rest and sleep. The tortoise knew it was slow and feared it would not catch up, so it kept going without stopping. When the rabbit woke up and ran to the finish line, the tortoise had already reached its destination. This is an example of diligence making up for clumsiness. In recent times, Chinese social customs emphasize socializing, often drinking and playing cards until late at night. If you don't sleep when you should sleep, you will naturally have no energy to work the next day. If you should go to work at eight or eight o'clock, you haven't gotten up by ten o'clock. If this is the case, there is no way to avoid failure in the future. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for the country and the nation. A few days ago, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said in his instruction at the headquarters that the soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles and the people in the occupied areas are suffering deeply, but it seems that people in the rear do not know these tragic situations. They are still singing and dancing, and the merchants do not know the hatred of national subjugation. How can such a phenomenon restore the country and the nation? If a nation wants to be strong, the prerequisite is that the people can be "diligent." If an individual wants to succeed in doing things, the most important thing is this "diligence." Therefore, last time I told everyone that many of the world's great inventors and entrepreneurs came from the word "diligence."</p>
<p>Second, Frugality. Frugality means not wasting. In all food, drink, and daily life, we should strive for economy. By being frugal ourselves, we will not be blinded by material desires, and our personal integrity can be upright and honest. Therefore, it is said that frugality nourishes integrity. The salary of civil servants is called "integrity salary," which is used to support integrity. The impression of officials in Chinese society has always been bad, because they are seen as being corrupt and accepting bribes, and extorting the people. Especially financial personnel, because they often handle money, are even more considered to be elements who exploit the people. The reason for this is that some civil servants have the bad habit of living luxuriously. In fact, a person's eating, clothing, and uses in the world are all limited. If you indulge in the desires of your mouth and stomach and are excessively greedy, it will not only be useless but also harmful. For example, if you eat too much, it will not only be difficult to digest but also cause illness. Foreigners often say that Chinese people have stomach problems because they eat too much. Foreigners' food intake is very small, and even banquets are not extravagant. When we Chinese people eat, we often have four plates of large bowls of delicacies, but in fact, we don't eat much. Most of it is wasted. Therefore, there is a saying, "The vermilion gates smell of wine and meat." The rest of the clothing and use are also extremely extravagant and unbridled. Many civil servants now earn one hundred, two hundred, or even three or four hundred a month, but they are still heavily in debt. This is because they do not know frugality. They usually spend arbitrarily, and their income does not meet their expenses. When they are heavily in debt and forced to have no way to think, they become corrupt. In the future, if we want the country to be politically clean and bright, we must start with the word "integrity" from civil servants. If we want to be able to be honest, we must work hard on the word "frugality." A country's finances cannot be considered sound without a budget. A person cannot live in society without a budget. Therefore, everyone's living expenses should have a budget. There should be appropriate allocation for clothing, food, socializing, children's education, medical care, and other expenses, and a portion should be set aside for savings. Because savings are the source of wealth. In the past, when the Chinese Eastern Railway was built, although Russia came forward, the capital mostly came from France, and it was all from the deposits of French savings banks. The people of France, regardless of their income, set aside a portion to save. For example, if they earned ten francs, they only used five or six francs and saved the remaining four. If they earned six francs, they only spent five and saved one in the bank. Even poor people could save from frugality in order to prepare for old age. This has become a habit of the French people. What I want to say to everyone today is that in the future we must create a "frugal" atmosphere. Everyone should develop the habit of saving. In addition to the necessary expenses for life, a portion of our income should be set aside for savings for our life in old age. If we can do this, not only will the country's politics be clean and bright, but each individual's life will also be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Third, Caution. Caution is the foundation of moral progress. Being able to be careful in words and deeds is a virtuous gentleman who can govern the country and secure the nation. The Great Learning says, "If you want to govern your country, you must first manage your family. If you want to manage your family, you must first cultivate yourself. If you want to cultivate yourself, you must first rectify your heart." That is to say, governing the country must start with self-cultivation. Many people have now forgotten the teachings of our ancient sages and worthies, and even the classics are no longer taught in schools. But I think it is good to read the Four Books and Five Classics in detail. Zhao Pu of the Song Dynasty used half of the Analects to govern the world. In the current era of scientific prosperity, although the Four Books and Five Classics are not enough to meet the needs, they still have value for research. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen advocated promoting inherent morality, and also carefully studied the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, never putting them down. Chiang Kai-shek, the director of our party, also tirelessly studied the Four Books and Five Classics, because the ancient books contain many principles for governing the country. Taking financial management as an example, the Great Learning also says, "With people, there is land. With land, there is wealth. With wealth, there is use. Virtue is the root, and wealth is the branch." What a heavenly and righteous argument this is! As for the methods of being a person and cultivating oneself, the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies are even more extensive. As long as everyone studies them diligently, there will be benefits. You will soon be serving the country. You must know that what China lacks now is not entirely scholarship, but loyal, hardworking, and sacrificing people for the country. There must be more such people for politics to be clean and for the country to have a way out. Otherwise, setting up more agencies and using more people will only increase corruption and embezzlement. The more money the people pay, the more dangerous the country's future will be. In the past, why did foreigners look down on us? It was because they thought that Chinese people could be bought with money and that everyone was corrupt and accepted bribes. Therefore, people would use Chinese people to stir up trouble among Chinese people, and they would encourage this warlord to overthrow that warlord, making it impossible for China to unite. But the situation is different now. Recently, Doihara said to people that the Japanese General Staff Headquarters' judgments on Chinese affairs in the past have always been very accurate. Every time a civil war occurred, they could know in advance who would fail and who would win. But this time, the Japanese General Staff Headquarters is very strange. Their predictions are fundamentally different from the facts. This is because, under the leadership of our nationally united supreme leader, we are not being used by them. Although there are a few traitors who are puppets of the Japanese, they are all things that have long been despised by mankind. Righteous gentlemen are determined not to be used. This is a kind of national integrity. If the country has this kind of integrity and the people have this kind of style, it will never perish. Speaking of the word "caution," we must also start with ourselves. The ancients emphasized "being cautious in solitude." Not only should we not do bad things in front of people, but we should also be cautious and fearful when others cannot see us. We should act according to our conscience, guard our mouths like bottles, guard our bodies like jade, and not do things that deceive Heaven and break the law. What we should strive for now is not only to do good deeds ourselves, but also to persuade others to do good deeds. That is, in addition to doing good deeds ourselves, we must also expose others who do bad deeds. If we can do this, the country will have a way out, and politics can get on the right track. I hope everyone will pay close attention to this point and create an atmosphere so that bad people dare not raise their heads and have no opportunity to engage in corruption. This is what I hope for. Let us all strive together.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Anti-Japanese War in North China and Estimation of Future Situation (2)</h3>
<p>— Peng Dehuai, Yu Mingfeng</p>
<p>(Continued from page 2 of yesterday's newspaper)</p>
<p>(b) The Eighth Route Army and various friendly forces in North China have adopted political disintegration, winning over, and military elimination tactics against all the deceived puppet organizations. This has resulted in great victories. The puppet "Imperial Collaborationist First Army" disintegrated, the traitor Li Fu was killed, and Japanese advisors were also killed. The Second Army was completely annihilated, with the army commander killed and two brigade commanders and two regimental commanders captured. The Third Army suffered repeated defeats, with only a small number entrenched in Shijiazhuang, afraid to come out. The remaining small number of puppet troops surrendered or were eliminated in large numbers. These victories were not accidental but were due to the awakening of the Chinese nation and hard work, creating popular hatred and resistance towards the Japanese invaders, traitors, and puppet troops.</p>
<p>( ) Adopt different specific methods for different types of traitors. Because while resolutely opposing traitors, the methods are multifaceted.</p>
<p>Zi: For major, die-hard traitors, conduct public trials and punish them according to the law, fully exposing their deeds to educate the people.</p>
<p>Chou: For wavering traitors, make every effort to win them over, using education and guidance to help them change their minds. Use the slogan "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people" to win them over. If they show signs of changing, send people to talk to them and use social pressure to separate them from the traitor camp.</p>
<p>Yin: As for those who are completely wavering, like those who are so-called "being in Cao Ying but with their heart in Han, not content with not killing the Japanese," we can use them to gather information, not confiscate their property, and keep their secrets. This way, we can both use them to do work and prevent them from openly collaborating with the enemy because we have already caught evidence against them. As for those who are truly unavoidable, we must cherish them and slowly win them over. These are all things we have tried and succeeded in. However, one should never easily believe what a traitor says and must use facts to prove it.</p>
<p>(p) Use political propaganda, disintegration, winning over, and military strikes to eliminate puppet troops. This is much better than relying solely on "hard fighting." At the same time, it also relies entirely on the raising of the people's awareness and enthusiasm for resisting Japan. For Japanese troops, use their soldiers' anti-war sentiments to carry out disintegration work. Leaflets and slogans are distributed to the Japanese army's camps or on our retreat lines. Japanese soldiers have a higher level of education and are naturally easily influenced by propaganda and waver. Secondly, shouting slogans in Japanese and talking to the Japanese army will inevitably reduce the Japanese army's combat effectiveness when they are exposed to our propaganda. Treat prisoners of war kindly to give them a good impression of our army. With training, they can also help us work. If there are many prisoners, letting them go back will expand our influence even more. Therefore, recently, ten Japanese soldiers on the Jinpu Railway surrendered with their weapons. This is a major event, proving that the Japanese army has been shaken by our propaganda. At the same time, in recent battlefields, the Japanese army is no longer as stubborn as it was at the beginning. In each battle, a large number of prisoners can be captured. As for puppet troops turning against the enemy, it is even more common. These all illustrate that with correct political work, puppet troops can be shaken and won over. Today, the weakness of puppet organizations and the failure of the puppet army in North China are due to the implementation of correct methods.</p>
<p>I will briefly introduce the battles between the National Revolutionary Army in North China and the Japanese invaders, so that those who are concerned about the war situation in North China can understand.</p>
<p>(1) Constantly crushing the enemy's encirclements:</p>
<p>(a) The Japanese attack on Jindongnan in April was crushed.</p>
<p>(b) Three encirclements in Northwest Shanxi were crushed.</p>
<p>(c) The recent encirclement of the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region by 50,000 Japanese troops was crushed, with 10,000 Japanese troops killed or wounded and the rest routed. Furthermore, a Japanese brigade commander and two regimental commanders were killed.</p>
<p>(d) The encirclement east of the Pinghan Railway was crushed.</p>
<p>(e) Three encirclements in the Ji-Re-Cha Region were crushed.</p>
<p>(2) Recovered territories:</p>
<p>(a) The Jindongnan region, including the Taihang Mountains area, between the Pinghan West, Zhengda South, and Tongpu East three railways, has complete counties including Heshun, Liao County, Yushe, Wuxiang, Qin County, Xiangyuan, Licheng, She County, Zanhuang, Lucheng, Pingshun, Lin County, Hu County Hui County, Lingchuan, Changzhi, Tunliu, Changzi, Gaoping, Xi County, Yangcheng, Jiyuan, Yuanqu, Pinglu, Xia County, Yicheng, Fushan, Qinshui, Anze, Qinyuan, etc., more than 30 counties. In addition, there are more than 50 counties along the railway lines, where the enemy occupies the towns and we occupy the vast countryside.</p>
<p>(b) The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, after breaking the enemy's encirclement last November, only Wutai still has a small number of enemy troops. Complete counties include Pingshan, Lingshou, Xingtang, Fuping, Yuan, Lingqiu, Guangling, etc.—more than 10 counties. There are dozens of counties along the Pinghan Railway, and more than 10 counties along the Pingsui Railway. Some enemy troops are currently attacking.</p>
<p>(c) The Ji-Re-Cha region currently has several counties including Xinglong, Pinggu, Lingnan, and Dingdu.</p>
<p>(d) East of the Tianjin-Jinan section on the Jinpu Railway, there are several counties including Qingling, Yangxin, and Deping.</p>
<p>(3) Military seizures:</p>
<p>What I know is limited to the Eighth Route Army. The seizures are not many and cannot satisfy the people's expectations and the tasks given by Chairman Chiang. I am very sorry and will work harder in the future to strive for greater victories to answer the hopes of everyone for the Eighth Route Army and the tasks given by Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>In the past, the seizures from the Japanese included:</p>
<p>More than 9,100 6.5mm rifles</p>
<p>More than 500 light machine guns</p>
<p>19 artillery pieces</p>
<p>More than 30 mortars</p>
<p>Many other military supplies</p>
<p>(4) Application of Strategic and Tactical Principles:</p>
<p>(a) The strategy is protracted, and everything is based on this standard, coordinating with the national war of resistance.</p>
<p>(b) The tactics are quick decisions. Each battle inflicts blows, attrition, and casualties on the enemy, maintaining tactical advantages and striving for quick decisions, making the enemy fear us. The enemy often uses their hands to signal to the masses, indicating their fear of our army. Persisting in the enemy's rear requires hitting the enemy so that they are afraid of us and we are not afraid of them. Only by hitting them can they not dare to move around, and only then can our actions be independent. If the enemy is not afraid of us and we are afraid of the enemy, we will easily fall into a passive position. This is a very simple principle. If we want the Japanese to fear us, we can only frequently hit or eliminate them.</p>
<p>(C) Strive for the initiative, control people, and often put the enemy in a passive position. For example, penetrating into eastern Hebei, the enemy originally thought that our army would break through north of the Pingsui Railway. Therefore, the enemy attempted to cut off our army's contact to eliminate our troops that had penetrated into eastern Hebei and Jehol. However, we had no worries and took advantage of the situation to lure the enemy, driving straight in, all the way to the Chaoyang-Shanhaiguan area, east to Liaoning. The enemy was afraid that we would penetrate deep into the Northeast and join forces with the Northeast Volunteer Army, so they urgently mobilized troops to chase and intercept us. However, we secretly and quickly inserted from the enemy's gap to the rear of the chasing troops, attacking one route fiercely and eliminating them.</p>
<p>(D) Use troops flexibly to eliminate the Japanese invaders very skillfully. Often catch the enemy off guard, causing them to misjudge and concentrate on attacking and eliminating their weak parts. It is necessary to be secretly mobile and swift to defeat the enemy and achieve victory.</p>
<p>(e) The cooperation between the regular army and guerrillas in North China is very close. Small guerrilla groups are distributed in various places, cooperating with the regular army, making it really difficult for the enemy to figure out the truth, making them impossible to defend against and suffering sudden attacks from our main force.</p>
<p>(f) The enemy's forces are not enough to be distributed, and we can freely mobilize. North China is vast, and it is really difficult for the enemy to form a complete encirclement. Therefore, they can only encircle in separate areas. We can cooperate with each other, attacking from the inside and outside, causing the enemy's several encirclements to fail.</p>
<p>(g) The army has a high degree of national consciousness, and the people can indeed form a united front. The anti-Japanese sentiment is very high, so the army's combat effectiveness is particularly strong.</p>
<p>Estimation of the Future of the War Situation in North China</p>
<p>A. We must deeply recognize:</p>
<p>When the national war situation improves and turns favorably to a stalemate between the enemy and us, the war situation in North China will become more serious and difficult, and the wars will be more numerous and fierce. Because North China is geographically and materially wealthy, it is urgently needed by the enemy. If the Japanese want to consolidate North China, they will inevitably attempt to eliminate our army in North China. Therefore, the future war situation will be:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese encircle in separate areas and occupy strongholds.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese will attempt to blockade our communication lines and cut off our connections.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese will inevitably increase their political deception and sowing of discord, as well as material difficulties.</p>
<p>B. The great significance of persisting in the anti-Japanese war in North China:</p>
<p>(1) North China is the last main battlefield for determining the outcome of our country's war of resistance.</p>
<p>(2) To strive for the arrival of a new situation in the national war of resistance, North China is a powerful strategic constraint. Because the Japanese army now in North China numbers as many as fifteen divisions, the more we try to bring the enemy to North China, the more serious the situation in North China will be, which will be more beneficial to the national war of resistance. Under strong containment, the Japanese will have to stop their offensive in central and southern China, taking advantage of the opportunity to allow our army to fully prepare for a counter-offensive under the leadership of the Military Commission.</p>
<p>(3) To persist in the anti-Japanese war in North China, so that the one hundred million people and abundant resources of North China will not be used by the Japanese invaders to break their goal of using Chinese to control Chinese and to absorb the wealth of North China to conquer China.</p>
<p>(4) The international impact is great. Persisting in the anti-Japanese war in North China to strive for more international sympathy and assistance for us.</p>
<p>(5) To provide powerful assistance to the country in persisting in the war of resistance behind the enemy lines, to concretely realize the strategic slogan of turning the enemy's rear into the front line, to excite the people of the country, to excite friendly forces, and to give the enemy a serious blow in fact.</p>
<p>C. Conditions for persisting in the victory of the anti-Japanese war in North China:</p>
<p>Persisting in the anti-Japanese war in North China is very important and there are many difficulties. However, are there any conditions for defeating the Japanese invaders? We firmly answer: yes. First of all, we have a population of 100 million and a vast territory, which are powerful bases for victory. ——Second:——</p>
<p>(1) The anti-Japanese war in North China is coordinated with the national war of resistance, making the enemy's forces insufficient to be distributed. Because the anti-Japanese war in North China is different from the isolation of the Northeast Volunteer Army, the anti-Japanese war in North China can contain the enemy and benefit the national war of resistance, stopping the offensive in central and southern China. The national war of resistance also prevents the enemy from concentrating on North China. If the enemy can completely concentrate on North China, North China will be even more difficult, but the national war of resistance will be even more beneficial.</p>
<p>(2) The military and civilians in North China have rich experience in 18 months of the war of resistance. In the course of the war, we have made many advances. The political reform in North China, the good discipline of the army, and the initial improvement of people's lives have made North China progress. At the same time, it has also educated the people of North China, giving them a high degree of victory, confidence, and determination to persist. Experience tells us that the anti-Japanese war in North China is sure to win, and the Chinese war of resistance is bound to be successful.</p>
<p>(3) The strong leadership of the progressive Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and other anti-Japanese parties and groups in North China plays a model role in front of the people, and there are correct methods to persist in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>(4) North China has a vast area, which is convenient for military mobility, and there are many mountains, and the geographical situation is favorable to us. Even on the vast plains, experience tells us that it can also be overcome.</p>
<p>(5) North China has a large population and abundant resources. The agricultural products such as salt, grain, and cotton are the best in the country, and they are all favorable conditions for us to persist in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>In addition to this, two more conditions must be added:</p>
<p>Zi: Political democracy and full mobilization of the masses</p>
<p>Chou: Sincere unity, without friction</p>
<p>Overcoming difficulties can persist in the protracted war of resistance, coordinate with the country, and strive for the ultimate victory</p>
<p>In short, the collapse of Japanese imperialism is inevitable, and the time is not far away. The liberation of the Chinese nation has already shown a glimmer of dawn. As long as we persist to the end, overcome difficulties, and strengthen unity, the war of resistance will surely be victorious. Today, the main problem is the sincere unity of the people of the country and the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are interdependent and closely related, and there must be no friction that hinders the war of resistance. At the same time, today, China's persistence in the war of resistance is the only correct direction for the liberation of the Chinese nation. It must follow the torrent of this era to move forward to have a bright future, while certain counter-currents that hinder progress will eventually be washed away by the huge torrent. Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the party and the country is one of the counter-currents, willingly falling behind and isolating himself from the people of the country. In the war of resistance, whoever works the hardest and is the most loyal will gain the support of the people. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party need closer cooperation. The development of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is beneficial to China's war of resistance and national liberation. Otherwise, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and other anti-Japanese parties will not develop. Is it possible to let the traitor forces develop? Therefore, we must work together in the same boat, go to the difficult times together, and exchange experiences and lessons learned from the crystallization of the blood of the Chinese nation. We must move forward on the bloodstains of the nation, and the Chinese nation will surely be liberated and establish a new China with the brilliant glory of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prisoners of War Participating in the Work of the New Fourth Army</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent Yan Su from southern Anhui</p>
<p>Because the reporter heard Commander Xiang Ying talk about the New Fourth Army's method of dealing with Japanese prisoners of war, which was very interesting, the reporter asked to speak with the Japanese prisoners of war face to face.</p>
<p>According to Commander Xiang, the New Fourth Army not only does not kill prisoners of war, but also treats them kindly. Furthermore, it actively gives Japanese prisoners of war the freedom to enter and leave, communicate, read, and work. Therefore, the Japanese prisoners of war in the New Fourth Army are like they are at home. They wear the same uniforms as the New Fourth Army and wear the blue sky with a white sun military caps. When there is nothing to do, they can freely stroll on the street, and the common people and brothers do not find it strange. The New Fourth Army's agency specifically responsible for the work of managing and teaching prisoners of war is the "Enemy Work Department." According to Commander Xiang, in the half year since the New Fourth Army started fighting, it has captured more than 590 Japanese and puppet troops, and several of them have already been able to participate in political work in the New Fourth Army.</p>
<p>This morning, at a farmer's home, the reporter met two young Japanese prisoners of war through the introduction of Lin Zhifu, the minister of the Enemy Work Department of the New Fourth Army, and Deng Zihui, the deputy director of the Political Department. When the reporter entered the room, the two of them were lying on the table reading. They were both wearing gray cloth cotton-padded coats and Chinese military caps. As soon as they heard someone, they immediately ran over with a smile, expressing a welcome. At the time, if it weren't for the explanation of Director Lin, the reporter would have thought that these two were the staff members of the New Fourth Army who managed the prisoners of war.</p>
<p>The reporter talked with the prisoners of war for more than an hour. From their backgrounds, families, and love, they talked about the future of the Sino-Japanese War. Now, to reflect their true opinions, all the question and answer records are written below. Reporter (Q): What are your names? Japanese prisoner (A): My name is Kagawa Masao, and he (pointing to another Japanese prisoner) is Tasaku Sakuza. (Hereafter, all conversations are between the reporter and Kagawa Masao) (Q) When did you come here? (A) About the end of July or the beginning of August of this year. (Q) How old are you this year? (A) I am twenty-two years old this year. (Q) What position do you hold in the army? (A) I was a transport soldier in the Third Division of the Japanese Army. (Q) Where is your home? (A) In Tokyo, Japan. (Q) Who else is in your family? (A) Father, mother, and two younger brothers. (Q) What occupation did you have in Japan? (A) I had no occupation. I was studying at a senior commercial school in Tokyo. (Q) Where did you land in China? (A) Landed at Wusong, but Japanese soldiers do not necessarily land at Wusong, some landed at Nanjing. (Q) When were you drafted into the army, and when did you leave the country to come to China? (A) I was drafted into the army in January of this year and transferred to China in June. (Q) What did the Japanese military tell you to do in China? (A) They told us: to fight against the red bandits and Chiang Kai-shek in China; At first, we did not know that the Japanese army was plundering and committing many atrocities in China. (Q) When you were conscripted into the army and judged to come to China, what did you and your family feel? (A) At that time, I was very painful in my spirit, but limited to national laws, I could not resist. My family, of course, also did not want me to go out. (Q) Where did you live for two months in Shanghai? (A) In a textile factory on the east side of Yangshupu. (Q) Where did you go in Shanghai? (A) I went to Zhabei and Nanshi, but the situation was very deserted. I have not been to the busy center of the concession. (Q) Have you ever seen Japanese soldiers raping and killing Chinese people? (A) I have not seen any rape of women myself, but I have heard brothers in the army often talk about it. I think some of them must have done it. I have not only seen the massacre of Chinese people, but I have seen many thousands of Chinese people being killed alive. At that time, I was very sad in my heart, but only sad. (Q) Before you were captured, you had been in China for two or three months. What are your thoughts about this three months in China? Especially your thoughts on the Sino-Japanese War? (A) Because the time was very short, I did not see much, but one thing, that is, when I arrived in Nanjing, because I saw many Chinese people being killed, at that time the superiors told our soldiers; they were all "bandits"—Chinese guerrillas, so they should be killed. At that time, I thought, why are there so many "bandits" in China? So many guerrillas? My brothers and I had the same feeling, so we gradually began to doubt the news of the Sino-Japanese War that was being promoted in Japan—but it was only internal doubt and distress. It was very difficult to take any action and resistance. (Q) How were you captured? (A) Two months later, I took a train from Shanghai to Nanjing. After living in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for two days, I was sent to Zhenjiang, and then transported a train from Zhenjiang to Danyang. On the way, in a place called "Moling," I encountered the guerrillas of the New Fourth Army. At that time, we (Japanese soldiers) were more than fifty people.</p>

<h3>Provincial governments are preparing to reorganize; Li Zongren will be the chairman of Hubei; Sun Lianzhong is rumored to be the chairman of Henan; Provincial department heads will be appointed by the ministries</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th by this newspaper] Provincial governments are preparing to reorganize to adapt to the major plan of the war of resistance. In addition to Xue Yue being confirmed as the chairman of Hunan, Li Zongren will be the chairman of Hubei, and Sun Lianzhong is said to be the chairman of Henan. The saying that Zhang Fang will be the chairman of Henan has become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th by this newspaper] The Executive Yuan has been discussing the issue of political reform for days. In order to adapt to the war of resistance, the central government has raised the status of the chairmen of various war zones and changed them to specially appointed officials, concurrently in charge of military, political, and party affairs, similar to the governors of the former Qing Dynasty. However, the heads of various provincial departments will be appointed by various ministries. The treatment of county magistrates and district chiefs below the county magistrate will be uniformly improved. The saying that the president of the Executive Yuan will be replaced is unlikely to come true. Xu Shiying has been called upon to serve as the vice president of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Airmail from Chongqing on the 11th by this newspaper] The central government is actively promoting the entire plan for the war of resistance. Based on the current strength, there will be absolutely no problems in the next two or three years. The central government has decided to expand the original party and government committee to strengthen the war of resistance forces. President Chiang himself will serve as the chairman, with Li Jishen as the deputy. There will be seven to eight members, four of whom will be Kuomintang members and two to three of whom will be Communist Party members. In addition to Zhou Enlai, who has been confirmed as a candidate for the committee, the remaining candidates are still being evaluated. All methods are currently being drafted.</p>
<h3>Northwest military deployment completed; Wei and Sun promoted to commander-in-chief; Xu Yuanquan and Shen Ke have been removed from their posts; Chairman Chiang instructs Yan and Zhu on military matters</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Xi'an on the 16th by this newspaper] The Northwest Headquarters has been established. After Director Cheng Qian takes office, Wei Lihuang and Sun Lianzhong will be appointed as the commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief of the First War Zone, respectively. Sun Dianying has been promoted to the commander of the ××× Army. Furthermore, Xu Yuanquan, Shen Ke, etc. have all been removed from their posts recently.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Xi'an on the 16th by this newspaper] When Chairman Chiang summoned various generals in Wugong a few days ago, Yan Xishan and Wei Lihuang were unable to attend because they were busy with military affairs in the front. However, all military plans have been telegraphed in detail by the authorities.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from a certain place in Shandong Province on the 16th by this newspaper] Yu Xuezhong's department, the commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone, has set out for a certain place between Jiangsu and Shandong. Shi Yousan's department has arrived in Chahar and will take office as the chairman of Chahar within days.</p>
<h3>Heroic Battle for Hejin; Japanese forces regroup to attack again</h3>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] Japanese troops in western Shanxi are launching a fierce offensive towards Hejin, where the Fen River and the Yellow River intersect, attempting to cross the Yellow River. However, according to Chinese sources, Hejin is still in the hands of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 16th] According to Chinese reports, the saying that the Japanese are propagating the independence of Guangxi is absolutely unreliable. China can rely on the existing assistance to support itself for as long as two years. In addition to the Japanese army in North China planning to cross the river at Hejin and engage in fierce battles with the Chinese army, the battles in other areas are mostly at a standstill. Chinese guerrillas are still very active, attacking the Japanese rear communication lines at any time to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Even the Japanese army admits to the activities of the guerrillas in Shanxi Province.</p>
<p>[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th] Chinese military authorities say that the situation in Hejin, where the Yellow River and the Fen River intersect in southwestern Shanxi, is unclear. Japanese troops are now launching a major offensive there. If the Japanese army can cross the Yellow River, Xi'an will be threatened.</p>
<p>[Min Ge She, Hebei, 16th] The People's Armed Self-Defense Army of Suiyuan has been very active near Wuchuan in recent days. It once recovered the county seat of Wuchuan, killing more than 40 Japanese soldiers and capturing one Japanese officer. We seized more than 30 rifles and many other military supplies and completely destroyed various military and political organs.</p>
<p>[Min Ge She, Xingji, 15th] This time, the enemy exhausted all its efforts to invade western Shanxi in two routes, but our military, political, and civilians joined forces to completely defeat them and successively recovered important strongholds such as Daxue, Pu County, and Ji County, creating a new record of victory in the Shanxi war. The reporter especially went to see a senior commander in a certain place in the front and asked about the course of the battle. He agreed to publish the following statement: This time, the enemy tilted its troops in Shanxi and invaded various places in western Shanxi in two routes, attempting to cross the river and invade the Northwest. One route, from Linfen, Xiangling, and Hejin, besieged Ji County in six routes, trying to spy on Xiaochuanwo. We used the people's revolutionary warfare tactics. On the one hand, we lured the enemy deep, and on the other hand, we systematically implemented the "empty room clearing of the wild," destroying traffic. The enemy felt isolated from the crowds in their food and actions along the way. Men and horses were frozen and starved, and they were in a panic. At the same time, our military pre-buried forces, taking advantage of the enemy's unstable breathing, besieged in separate routes, and the route had to flee back in a hurry. In addition to tailing, our army also carried out planned guerrilla warfare along the way.</p>
<h3>Li Hanhun sends a telegram to comfort overseas Chinese in the Philippines</h3>
<p>[Local News] The Philippine Chinese community is extremely supportive of the motherland's war of resistance, sparing no effort in helping to kill the enemy, donating money, materials, and efforts. It is the crown of overseas Chinese. Now that Chairman Li Hanhun has officially taken office, Guangdong is expected to have new developments. Various overseas Chinese organizations have specially sent letters to the Hong Kong representatives who returned to the country, sending telegrams of congratulations and expressing their hope for comfort for the Guangdong affairs. Chairman Li replied in a telegram: "Mr. Xu Guanzhi transfers to the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Association. I received your telegram and know that the overseas Chinese are concerned about the country and their expectations are deep. I will not dare to hesitate in the face of social difficulties. I hope you will convey my comfort and gratitude. Li Hanhun (stamped)"</p>

Peng Xuepei has voluntarily stopped attending to his duties at the ministry.</p>
<p>Special Article from Our Newspaper</p>
<h3>Gifts I Brought Back from Guangxi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tao Xingzhi</p>
<p>Speaking of education, Director of Education of Guangxi Province, Qiu Changwei, told me that the county-run junior high schools in each county must follow the county government. If a certain county town falls in the future and the county government moves to the countryside, then this school must also go to the countryside with the county government. This is a type of school that follows the county government. The county government is not allowed to move out of the county boundaries, so the school is also not allowed to move out of the county boundaries. Each county has one such school, which is to cultivate talents for each county, talents who can share weal and woe with the guerrillas and the common people.</p>
<p>Secondly, students over the age of eighteen should be trained collectively to increase the strength for resisting Japan and building the nation. Those who volunteer for military service can volunteer to join the student army corps. Currently, × army corps of student soldiers have already been established.</p>
<p>The most common thing in Guangxi is the National Basic School. In every corner of the countryside, there is a magnificent school. These schools teach children during the day and adults at night. I stayed in Luxu for two nights, and after dinner, I went to visit the local National Basic School. Walking in, I saw two classrooms filled with female students. I carefully counted them, and there were twenty-two women who were holding their children while attending class. It was clear that there was no one at home to take care of the children, so they had to hold or carry their children to study. This kind of spirit is extremely worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>The principals of elementary schools in Guangxi are a trinity. The principals of village and street elementary schools are also the village chiefs and the reserve militia captains. Each township and town has a central school, and the principal serves as the township head and the reserve militia battalion commander. One person combines three positions, which is called a trinity. Their salaries are 15 yuan in legal tender per month for the central school principals and 10 yuan in legal tender per month for the village and street school principals. When I went to Lijiang, I met a friend from another province who criticized this system. I said that as far as I could see along the way, the system itself was very good. It was not only suitable for the situation in Guangxi, but also for the needs of the national resistance against Japan. Because firstly, it integrates politics and does not cause friction; secondly, it saves money. Other provinces can also consider imitating it. He said, "How can you hire talented people with ten yuan a month?" I replied, "The staff of the Eighth Route Army all receive five yuan per month, and only when the army publicly recommends Zhu De can the commander have meat to eat. Judging by the salary standard, Guangxi elementary school principals should be able to hire people of Zhu De's caliber to take office." Before Hankou was abandoned, General Bai Chongxi also told me: "China cannot win the war now, simply because we are still wearing good clothes and eating good food. When our troops wear patched clothes and even finding gruel to eat becomes difficult, when you and I are like beggars, that is when we will win the war."</p>
<p>There is an old lady Zhao in the Northeast and a Grandma Zeng in Guangxi, both of whom are worthy of emulation. Mr. Huang Renzhi once told me the story of Grandma Zeng. This time when I went to Guangxi, I inquired about it, and her reputation was indeed well-deserved. Guangxi not only has organization and relatively widespread education, but the people's spontaneous patriotic spirit is even more admirable. Grandma Zeng is a representative of such good people. She is from Xiuren County. Her son did not pass the conscription and could not become a soldier on the front line, so she personally took her son to the county magistrate to volunteer. If the old ladies of China only learned from Grandma Zeng, then China's source of soldiers would be inexhaustible. The children of Guangxi are also worthy of praise. It goes without saying that the Guangxi Young Teachers' Movement, which was a whirlwind three or four years ago, was excellent. The wartime children's service corps in the provincial capital was created under my own eyes. The children's choir of the Zhongshan Memorial School is particularly energetic. When the × planes came, the brave children did not want to hide in the air-raid shelter. They climbed up the mountain to observe the traitors. Seeing traitors on the ground using mirrors or similar things to reflect light to indicate direction, they immediately ran down the mountain to report to the students, and together they went to arrest the traitors. The children of Guangxi are good at catching traitors. Indeed, I saw it twice.</p>
<p>Guangxi's economy is a rural economy. The province has an Agricultural Management Office that oversees all agricultural facilities in the province. The province is divided into six districts, with supervisors stationed in each district. At the lowest level is the county agricultural management office, which promotes talent of more than six hundred people, using full power in places where × people cannot reach, massively increasing production. To mention only one thing, tung oil is Guangxi's largest export. Their entire plan is to plant three thousand trees per county, two thousand trees per township, and one thousand trees per village every year. Tung trees can bear fruit in three years. They mobilize the entire province, the counties, the townships, and the villages, to do it together.</p>
<p>The Hui and Han ethnic groups here are also united in spirit. On November 27th, the Guangxi branch of the China Hui People's National Salvation Association was established in Guilin. Principal Tang Ke San and Principal Ma Songxue invited me to give a speech. I saw that kind of spirit of cooperation to resist ×, which really made me celebrate for the Chinese nation. Originally, the doctrines of Islam aim for peace and use anti-aggression as a means. This is the same as China's national policy of resisting Japan. General Bai himself is a Muslim and a leading figure in the resistance against Japan, so the spirit of unity between the Hui and Han in Guangxi is even more harmonious. The congratulatory message I sent at the time was:</p>
<p>Four hundred and fifty million believers, compatriots regardless of Hui and Han,</p>
<p>Create a great Chinese nation, with one heart and one mind to win the war.</p>
<p>Guangxi's attitude towards intellectuals is also worth discussing. Some people think that Guangxi seems too indifferent to intellectuals. There are also reasons for this. One is because of misunderstanding, and the other is because some intellectuals from outside have caused problems. A friend from the military told me: "Look, those intellectuals, doctors, bachelors, don't fight, but they desperately advocate fighting. Now that the war has started, they swim from Shanghai to Nanjing, from Nanjing to Hankou, from Hankou to Chongqing, from Chongqing to Guiyang to Guilin, unable to endure hardship, so they have to swim back to Shanghai. Doctors of Law have many tricks to play with the law, so that they don't have to be soldiers themselves, and their sons don't have to be soldiers either. Only the farmers die, which is too unfair." His remarks are true, but with a bit of misunderstanding. It should be distinguished whether those intellectuals who wander around are the same ones who advocate resistance to Japan. But Guangxi has really seen too much of those intellectuals who wander around, and they are somewhat annoyed. Especially female intellectuals or intellectual women: with their hair permed, wearing high heels, painting their lips blood-red, and powdering their faces snow-white, are such women beneficial to Guangxi? Can they improve the young women of Guangxi's countryside? We intellectuals from other provinces also need to reflect on this. Guangxi not only is somewhat suspicious of intellectuals who wander around from other provinces, but also does not necessarily treat the intellectuals of this province who talk grandly and speak empty words well. Once, some students ran to the countryside to give speeches, and the old folks asked them, "Why don't you go fight the war when you are so young, but you have time to lecture me? My son went to fight the Japanese × in the spring. Why haven't you gone yet?"</p>
<p>The responsibility of us outsiders going to Guangxi is that if we cannot contribute to Guangxi, we should also learn some good things from Guangxi. We must also not say that Guangxi does not value culture just because Guangxi is indifferent to intellectuals who wander around. I know that technical talents from outside are particularly valued, and their salaries are higher than those of the provincial chairman. They welcomed the children's drama troupe, the New An Touring Troupe, and the Second Team of the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe led by Jin Shan with great fanfare!</p>
<p>The entire Guangxi has been dedicated to the Chinese nation. It has contributed 400,000 soldiers, handed over the armory, donated more than 10 million silver dollars, and will contribute tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of guerrillas. If we follow Guangxi in dedicating ourselves to the Chinese nation, then we will definitely be able to drive the Japanese aggressors out under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and we can also create a free and equal Republic of China!</p>
<p>These are the things I brought back from Guangxi. I also want to bring some good gifts from various places to send to Guangxi. 28th Year, 14th Night</p>
<h3>Our Army in Hebei Province is Growing Stronger; The Eighth Route Army is Expanding Rapidly</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, Sixteenth] According to a visitor from central Hebei, Shi Yousan's troops number no less than 20,000 men and are now under the command of Lu Zhonglin. Therefore, the strength of the Central Army in central and southern Hebei is growing. Nangong and Daming are under control. Also, the Eighth Route Army is absorbing scattered soldiers and expanding quickly. The Japanese army is concerned about the safety of Shijiazhuang and has stationed many troops there.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Bombed; More Than a Hundred Bombs Dropped</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, Sixteenth] Yesterday, × planes attacked Chongqing. Although the attack was very short, the destructive power was very great. The × planes dropped about a hundred bombs, mostly in the western part of the city, destroying many houses. Before the × planes reached Chongqing, the Chinese side knew that forty-two × planes were coming, so they dispatched planes to intercept them. Most of the × planes scattered and fled. Only twenty-seven reached the city. One Japanese bomber was shot down and fell outside Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, Sixteenth] Today, twenty-one Japanese planes dropped bombs on both sides of the Jialing River and in the western district of the city, causing the first major losses here. Many citizens were killed by the bombing. Chinese planes engaged them fiercely. Chongqing refugees are gathering, and there is a fear of overcrowding. If the Japanese × drop bombs in the center of the city, the deaths and injuries will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, Sixteenth] Last Sunday, six Japanese planes dropped bombs in densely populated areas of Wanxian city. According to Chinese reports, most of the buildings in the city were destroyed, and an elementary school was also affected. Fifty female students were killed and eight were injured.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, Sixteenth] Today, citizens here, in view of yesterday's air raid, began to evacuate some women and children to the interior.

<h3>Wuxi Salt Factory × Completely Eliminated; Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu × Panic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, Sixteenth Dispatch] The town of Dangkou in Wuxi (a central area for inland river commerce) is stationed with many × troops. Their salaries are provided by the Chiang puppet organization through taxes and levies on shops. On the morning of the ninth, our guerrillas surrounded the dedicated factory of the × troops headquarters in the town. Eighty daredevils opened and guarded the side and rear doors. All forty-two × soldiers were wiped out. Currently, × troops from the three counties of Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changshu are reinforcing by different routes, but our army has dispersed and returned to various places, not engaging in combat.</p>
<h3>Southwest Railway Network Accelerating Construction;滇缅 Railway Mostly Completed; Chongqing Becomes Southwest Economic Hub</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, Sixteenth Dispatch] The Southwest Railway Network is under active construction. The Xukun Road will build the Weining to Guiyang section, and a branch line from Guiyang to Liuzhou.

<h3>Important Decision by the Relief Committee: Relief for the Unemployed in the Rear; The Entire Plan Can Be Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, Sixteenth Dispatch] The Relief Committee has held meetings for several days and decided on the key points of the new relief principles. Those who are unemployed and poor in the rear will receive the same relief as refugees from the front lines. The entire plan can be announced immediately.</p>
<p>[Guangzhou Correspondence] In the past two months, × planes have wreaked havoc in the Beihai and Lianzhou areas. Yuen Chau Tun, Gaode, Waisha, Longwang Temple, Gangwa Yao, the county administration in Guangzhou City, formerly the site of a girls' elementary school, as well as Wulan, Qingshui River, Qili Bridge and other places, have suffered extremely damaged housing and injured civilians. It is especially worse in recent days, and there are homeless people moaning on the streets everywhere. Fortunately, people in the local church allocated church housing and did their best to accommodate them. The Hepu Refugee Relief Branch is also making every effort to evacuate the residents of northern Lianzhou to safe areas, so there are still few displaced persons. It is heard that the local church is now working with the Hepu Refugee Relief Association to coordinate cooperation, in addition to setting up the Lianbei Church Nanshe as a temporary shelter, also establishing multiple shelters in Xiaojiang Zhanghuang and other places in the county, in order to accommodate refugees evacuated from northern Lianzhou. This is also an indispensable good deed during the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Members from Various Places Flock to Chongqing to Attend the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, Fifteenth Dispatch] Central Committee members Wu Yifeng and Li Qian arrive in Yunnan and transfer to Chongqing to attend the Fifth Plenary Session.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The Fifth Plenary Session is scheduled to be held in Chongqing on the 20th of this month. Central Committee members at home and abroad are rushing to Chongqing to attend before the meeting. It has been found that 20 Central Committee members staying in Hong Kong, including Chen Yaoyuan, Lu Yougang, and Liu Zaozhi, have returned to the country in batches in the past few days, taking ships to Hanoi and entering Yunnan to Sichuan, or directly taking China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes to Chongqing.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, Sixteenth Dispatch] According to Tokyo news, in addition to accepting the army's demands, expanding national defense equipment, and intensifying national mobilization, the Hiranuma Cabinet also followed the navy's request to pay close attention to the international situation, especially the attitudes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, Sixteenth] According to an official report from Changchun, the government of "Manchukuo" has officially announced its participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Japan to Recall Ambassador; Japan Largely Intimidates the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongbian, Fifteenth Dispatch] Tokyo Dispatch: A certain authoritative authority here recently made a statement to the Associated Press reporter, saying that most Japanese government officials advocate first recalling Ambassador Togo to the Soviet Union, which is more beneficial to Japan. Japanese soldiers believe that the Soviet Union is currently busy with domestic issues and the issue of Germany and Ukraine, and has no time to deal with foreign affairs. Therefore, it is believed that recalling Togo will not cause a direct conflict with the Soviet Union. According to the trend of severing diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, Soviet consulates in Harbin and other places have been closed. Furthermore, the issue of oil fields in the giant island of Kuye has caused some friction between Japan and the Soviet Union. Subsequently, all German and Japanese expatriates there were expelled from the country by the Soviet authorities. The embassies of various countries here mostly believe that the diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are now extremely dangerous, which has not happened since the end of the Zhanggufeng Incident. Therefore, they have reported to their respective governments, saying that one or two months are the most important key in the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>× Troops Continue to Increase in the Xijiang Area; Minor Contacts on the Hunan-Jiangxi Front</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhongshan, Sixteenth Dispatch] In the past few days, the movement of × troops in South China has been frequent. It is expected that × troops will launch a large-scale offensive against Guangxi from Guangzhou via the Xijiang River and plan to land somewhere west of Beihai in southwestern Guangdong. Several teams of × troops have now arrived in Sanshui and Sinan (place names), and their goal is to advance along the Xijiang River towards Wuzhou or attack Guangxi via the Xiaobei River. General Bai Chongxi is now in Guilin. Guangxi is in a strategically important location, and the military and civilians are determined to resist ×. If × invades, it will suffer a serious blow. According to confirmed news, Zhang Fakui, Li Hanhun, Ye Zhao, and Wu Qiwei had already arrived in northern Guangdong to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, Sixteenth Dispatch] The Guangdong News Reporters Association and the Student Union sent a telegram to Xue Yue, the Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth War Area, requesting him to lead the team to recover Guangzhou. Xue replied in a telegram, roughly saying that the Central Government has a comprehensive plan for this matter, and as a soldier, I should act on orders. However, what can be told to the fellow villagers in Guangdong Province is that we will do our best to restore the lost land. Your concerns about your homeland are naturally worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, Fifteenth Dispatch] The × seems to have the intention of continuing to repair the railway from Yueyang to Matang section. According to reports, the × train from Yueyang to Linxiang runs four or five times a day, each time carrying four or five carriages, mostly carrying timber from the north of Yueyang, and from the south of Linxiang, there are gravel, steel rails and other military supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, Fifteenth Dispatch] The × stationed in Tongcheng mostly withdrew north. Only more than 300 × are left in the city. In recent days, after continuous attacks and sweeps by our guerrillas, the ×'s rear transportation lines and communication networks have been cut off. Small groups of × soldiers have been eliminated. Therefore, in recent days, the × in the city have tightly closed the four gates, daring not to go out. We have changed from a passive position in the war to an active position.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, Fifteenth Dispatch] According to those who escaped from Yueyang, the × army in Yueyang, due to the activities of our guerrillas in all directions, recently felt that the number of troops could not be properly distributed, and even forced the able-bodied men in the city who had not been able to escape to act as puppet police, under the surveillance of a few remaining ×, to maintain order in the city. Our people are well aware of the importance of the situation and are unwilling to be driven by them, and most of them have already escaped, and the × are extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhang Gongdu, Fifteenth Dispatch] On the Xiushui front, since the eleventh, there have been one or two × planes every day, constantly circling and observing along the south bank of the river, east from Xujiabu, west to Baicha, south to the airspace above Wanjiabu and Lehua. They were all driven away after being swept and shot by our anti-aircraft artillery units. On the fifteenth, not a single × plane was seen all day. Only at about 8:00 a.m., the × on the north bank of Qiujin fired more than a dozen shells at the Taiziling and Tang'anling areas on our south bank. After our counterattack with several shots, the × artillery fire turned silent again.</p>

<h3>Britain, the United States, and France Will Unite to Implement Retaliation Against Japan; Will Never Recognize Military Occupation; France Will Follow Britain in Sending Notes to Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, Sixteenth] It is expected here that the French government will soon submit a note to the Japanese government similar to the British note. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Japanese government does not intend to respond quickly to the British note, because the Japanese government will repeatedly explain the situation in detail to the British and American ambassadors. At present, the British government is preparing to revise the Nine-Power Treaty, while Japan believes that the time is not yet ripe.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, Sixteenth] British political circles deeply believe that France's note to Japan indicates that Britain, the United States, and France will definitely express a united front in dealing with Japan in the near future. France's note is also the same as the one issued by Britain the day before yesterday, asking Japan to explain its plans for China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Sixteenth] The "Birmingham Post" said today, "The note delivered by Britain to Japan is a politically first important document. This note has no expression of weakness, nor does it allow room for debate. This note views the violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, which directly damages China, as no less than the acceptance of damage between the interests of the powers. This is gratifying. The Japanese government believes that Britain and the United States will not take active actions, which is unwise."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Sixteenth] The diplomatic reporter of the "Times" said, "The British note can prove that the resistance to Japan presented by the powers due to the infringement of rights and interests has been increasing day by day. This note clearly expresses that it still recognizes Chairman Chiang as representing China. All the puppet organizations under the control of the Japanese army are not recognized by the powers. These puppet organizations also have no right to negotiate Chinese issues."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Sixteenth] The "Manchester Guardian" criticized the British note, saying, "Not only is the military power of Britain and the United States in the Pacific superior to that of Japan, as recently indicated by German naval experts, but they can also control the main markets for Japanese exports. Japan's economy is based on these markets. If Britain and the United States are joined by France and the Netherlands (both of whom are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty) in dealing with Japan, then Japan's position will be extremely critical."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Sixteenth] The "Manchester Guardian" said, "We can only say that the time for Britain to present the note to Japan has been delayed for too long. In addition, in view of the fact that very few people in our government have had the experience of 'telling the truth' in the past eight or nine years, this note is particularly commendable. The government is finally acting jointly with the US government to this day. If Britain and the United States can continue to work together, then we can believe that Japan will pay close attention. Roosevelt's warning was his first response to this time. The British government's unwillingness to give in to the aggressor was also his first expression this time. Berlin and Rome will attach no less importance than Tokyo, and London and New York will be no less pleased than Chongqing." Also, the "Daily Mail" said that before it was presented, the US and France would have seen its contents and approved it. Therefore, if Japan maintains its attitude of "being courteous on the one hand and feigning ignorance on the other," then the US and France will be able to cooperate in any retaliatory action, which mostly consists of levying heavy import duties on Japanese goods or completely prohibiting Japanese goods from being transported into Britain or British colonies. If the government can recover some profits for its merchants in the ashes, then the merchants will naturally be grateful."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Fifteenth] Reuters diplomatic reporters have learned that France had known about the British note to Japan and approved it in advance. It is generally believed that the British government had been considering for quite some time the decision to send a strong note to Japan. The British government also consulted the US note when drafting the note.</p>
<h3>Contents of British Note</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, delivered a strongly worded note to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita last Saturday. The note stated the British government's grave concern over Japan's policy towards China and emphasized the British government's intention to adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty. It stated that the British government, while exploring Japan's new policy on the Far East situation based on the recent statements by former Prime Minister Konoe on December 3rd and 22nd, and Foreign Minister Arita's press conference on December 19th, is greatly concerned that Japan's intentions remain unclear. "Lord Craigie's meeting with Mr. Arita has not clarified matters. The British government believes that your government intends to form a tripartite group of Japan, China, and 'Manchukuo,' led by Japan, with China and Manchuria in a subordinate position. As for China, your government intends to control it through the Asia Development Board, whose function is to formulate and implement policies regarding China's political, economic, and cultural affairs." "The note further stated that Arita's remarks to the press indicated that the combination of Japan, China, and 'Manchukuo' aims to create an economic bloc, and that the economic activities of other countries in China would be restricted based on the bloc's defense and economic needs." "According to your former Prime Minister Konoe, the Sino-Japanese War will not cease until the Chinese government is defeated or willing to join this group. Your country also demands that China sign an anti-communist agreement and that your troops be stationed indefinitely in certain special areas of China to ensure the strict compliance with the armistice conditions you propose. Prince Konoe also stated that Inner Mongolia must be a special anti-communist zone. The British government lacks sufficient information on this matter and believes that this would place Inner Mongolia under your country's military control to an even greater extent than other parts of China. Prince Konoe has guaranteed that your country has no territorial ambitions in China and respects China's sovereignty. However, he simultaneously forces the Chinese people to accept harsh conditions, subjecting China's political, economic, and cultural life to your country's control, allowing your troops to be stationed in China indefinitely, and effectively ceding important Inner Mongolia. The British government fails to understand how these two can be reconciled. The British government has stated that it will not accept or recognize any new situation brought about by force. The British government is determined to abide by the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and cannot agree to any changes based on unilateral actions. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the treaty had gradually produced good results. The Chinese people were maintaining a strong and stable government and were increasingly developing. The principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations was gradually bringing prosperity to China, and its international trade with all countries (including your country) was progressing. Therefore, the British government cannot express agreement to Japan, claiming that the treaty is obsolete or that its provisions are not adequate to the current situation. Moreover, even if there have been changes in the situation, they have all been caused by Japan's violation of the treaty's provisions. The British government believes that a treaty's alteration cannot be made by unilateral action but must be negotiated and implemented jointly by all signatory countries. If the Japanese government wishes to change multilateral treaties concerning China and proposes constructive suggestions, the British government is prepared to consider them but at the same time reserves all rights under the current treaties." Former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement saying that Japan is prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights and concessions in China. However, Japan "uses this kind of enticement to encourage China to accept its conditions, while the loss to Japan itself is limited. If Japan's plan to control China succeeds, then extraterritorial rights and concessions will be of no use. The British government recalls that in 1931, it negotiated with the Chinese government to abolish British extraterritorial rights and nearly succeeded. At that time, Japan's forceful occupation of Manchuria and the resulting situation brought the negotiations to a halt. Although the British government remains prepared to resume these negotiations at an appropriate time and is willing to discuss extraterritorial rights and other similar issues with a fully independent Chinese government after peace is restored. If the Japanese government misunderstands the British government's true intentions, it is because the Japanese government's views expressed so far are self-contradictory. If Japan can provide a more precise and detailed explanation of the conditions for ending the Sino-Japanese War and its policy towards China, it would be welcomed by the British government."</p>
<h3>German-Japanese Spies Reconnoitering Naval Secrets; U.S. Sends Special Agents to Monitor</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Havana, 15th] According to unconfirmed reports from Santiago, U.S. secret agents have arrived at the Caimanera Naval Base to investigate the activities of German-Japanese spies. After the U.S. fleet sailed to Guantanamo Naval Base, German-Japanese spies began their activities, fearing leaks of secrets. Therefore, the United States has also dispatched secret agents to monitor the activities of German-Japanese spies.</p>
<h3>French Premier's Speech: Determined Not to Yield; Radical Party Passes Vote of Confidence; Blum Advocates Opening Western Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] French Premier Daladier stated in an important meeting of the Radical Party Executive Committee today, "The French government does not want to take any risks, but it is determined not to yield." The committee passed a resolution stating that France cannot agree to any territorial concessions. Even when the political situation changes and negotiations can begin, France will not consider any concessions that would harm its sovereignty. The meeting also unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the government. Daladier continued, "The government's policy is to maintain peace and strengthen national defense. The government certainly wants to avoid bloodshed but also pays attention to France's interests. The government must make every effort to eliminate conflicts to preserve Western culture, but it cannot allow France's position and interests to be threatened by force. The French government is prepared to demand that the formulation of domestic policy should first pay attention to the integrity of France and the French Empire and the important interests of the entire nation." The resolution passed by the committee stated, "The establishment of Italian influence in Spanish territory, whether in the Balearic Islands or along the Moroccan coast, poses a serious danger to France's communication lines in the Mediterranean. It is hoped that the government will closely examine this situation." Yesterday, Daladier had a long talk with former Premier Blum. The details of the conversation have not been announced, but "Le Populaire" published an article by Blum stating that the Spanish border must be opened now. It is heard that Mussolini told Chamberlain that even if Franco wins in Spain, Italy still intends to station troops in Spain."</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Declare Occupation of Terragona; Northern Route Also Approaches Coloma</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lerida, 15th] Franco's military headquarters announced that rebel forces have completely occupied Tarragona and Reus. Some rebel units have reached the mouth of the Gaya River. Rebel forces on the northern route have also occupied Angri Sala, reaching the outskirts of Tarrega. Another part of the rebel forces has approached Coloma, only thirty-five miles from Barcelona.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lerida, 15th] The rebel Fifth Division is currently advancing into Tarragona.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 15th] Spanish government forces crossed the Tajo River in Toledo early this morning. It is claimed that they launched a surprise attack on the rebel forces, forcing them to retreat from their first line of defense.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] According to a dispatch from Jaen from the Spanish news agency, Spanish government forces launched two successful attacks near Villanueva del Rosario today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Washington Senator Schwellenbach stated that he will submit a proposal to Congress today to increase the President's power to control scrap iron exports to belligerent countries. He said that the export volume of scrap iron has been very large in the past five years, so the government should prohibit it in the same way as it manages the manufacture and restriction of arms. Although he has not discussed this matter with the President, the Bureau of Mines is now planning to establish a "base metals" section dedicated to dealing with pig iron and managing raw materials. Michigan Senator Couzens and Senator Nye, chairman of the Senate Munitions Committee, also have similar proposals.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Meets Yesterday; Openly Discusses Spanish Issue; Chinese Representative Meets with British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 16th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet participated in the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting this morning to draft the agenda. The agenda will include the China issue. It is expected that Halifax will have a private meeting with Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, before going to London tonight. The major issue to be discussed openly this afternoon is the Spanish issue. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini told Chamberlain that he wants to respect the territorial integrity of Spain. This move is currently considered very important. If the Barcelona government suddenly fails, the League of Nations may take important actions.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Revise Plan; Supplement Fleet; Watching U.S. Naval Expansion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to Japanese naval authorities, the United States' renewed proposal to expand its navy is an internal measure. I do not believe that the peace-loving American people are willing to launch an arms race, making other countries feel uneasy. Whenever the U.S. Congress is in session, there is talk of naval expansion. However, we who are responsible for national defense cannot completely ignore it. Japan's attitude towards the London Naval Treaty has not changed, that is, to set up a self-defense navy at the most economical cost to meet the needs of our country. However, in view of the current world situation, we may have to revise the fleet supplementation plan to maintain our country's basic naval policy.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Returns to London; Thousands of People Welcome Him Warmly; British and Italian Prime Ministers Exchange Telegrams; Friendship Between the Two Countries Becomes Stronger</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] Chamberlain and his entourage, except for Halifax who is currently in Geneva, arrived here at 5:25 PM (British time) today. Previously, Chamberlain arrived in Paris at 9:10 AM this morning. He got off the train and had breakfast with the British Ambassador to France, Phipps, and informed him of the details of the talks in Rome. At 10:50 AM, he changed ships at Calais and returned to the country. The sea was calm when crossing the coast. He arrived at Folkestone, and more than 5,000 people gathered at Victoria Station in London to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] When British Prime Minister Chamberlain returned here from Rome, thousands of people gathered at Victoria Station to welcome him. He drove back to his official residence on Downing Street via Whitehall. He wore a carnation on his chest and carried his historic umbrella. Although he had crossed the English Channel, he looked very good. The crowds at the station cheered him, and some shouted, "Don't interfere in Spain." Minor disputes occurred among the crowd, and two people were arrested by the police on suspicion of insulting behavior. After returning to Downing Street, he sent a telegram to Mussolini, expressing his sincere gratitude for the welcome he received in Rome, saying, "We have arrived here safely. Our belief in Anglo-Italian friendship and our hope for maintaining peace have become stronger." Mussolini replied, "I am pleased to reiterate that the visit to Rome by you and Lord Halifax has confirmed the friendship between Britain and Italy and my personal confidence in maintaining peace in accordance with justice." British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also exchanged similar telegrams. The Italian Foreign Intelligence Agency stated regarding last week's talks in Rome that Mussolini repeatedly stated to Chamberlain that when other countries also take the same action and grant Franco belligerent rights, Italy will withdraw its troops from Spain. However, if countries sympathetic to the Spanish government take large-scale intervention actions in the near future, Italy will again take free action, believing that the non-intervention policy has failed.</p>
<p>London Newspapers Emphasize Talks Between British and French Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] This morning, newspapers here all published the talks between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Geneva in prominent positions. The news of the League of Nations holding a regular meeting was relegated to an unimportant position. According to the Daily Mail, at this time of global turmoil, the League of Nations is holding its 104th regular meeting to discuss the issues of China and Spain. However, it is so weak that it can only express regret for these wars and cannot take any other action. The only most useful thing in Geneva today is the conversation between Halifax and Bonnet. However, these two attended only for ceremonial reasons and will leave Geneva and return to their countries after the first meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 14th] French officials have commented on the talks conducted by British and Italian cabinet members in Rome, saying that this move did not produce new factors. It is fortunate that the position agreed upon by the British cabinet members with the French government authorities can be fully maintained. In general, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not ask the British to mediate because Britain and France maintain a linked relationship. He also avoided making concrete demands on France. In addition, it is heard that Prime Minister Mussolini expressed that victory for the Spanish Nationalist Army is guaranteed, and therefore refused to discuss the Spanish issue with British cabinet members, but said that the Anglo-Italian agreement should be respected. Once the Spanish civil war ends, he will order all Italian troops to withdraw from Spain.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>The British Note to Japan That Shook the World</h3>
<p>"The British note to Japan will shock the world." This is not only a comment from British circles but also a possible fact.</p>
<p>The British note was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry last Saturday by Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan. This note pointed out that although Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statements on December 3rd and 22nd and Foreign Minister Arita's press conference on December 19th stated that Japan has no territorial ambitions in China, Japan is in fact forcing the Chinese people to submit by force, which the British government cannot understand. Therefore, the British government should do its best to uphold the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>The rampant behavior of Japanese aggressors in the Far East, on the one hand, uses force to oppress China and destroy human culture, and on the other hand, also destroys the rights and interests of Britain, the United States, and other countries, and disrupts world peace. If the British government had issued this kind of note rebuking Japan at the time of the "September 18th Incident," today's situation would have been very different. However, the British government finally issued this note. If it can be followed by firm support with strength, it will still have a very significant decisive effect on the future situation. Because first, this note from the British government has refuted Japan's so-called lack of territorial ambitions in China based on current facts and solemnly stated that "Britain will not accept the new situation created by force." This indicates that Britain will take stronger and more active steps to aid China and restrain Japan. Second, the content and wording of this note are exactly the same as the U.S. note to Japan, indicating that the British government will take joint action with the U.S. government's recent anti-fascist and anti-aggression policies.</p>
<p>Since this British note contains the above two major meanings, it is not only a major blow to the Japanese aggressors but also the first powerful response to President Roosevelt's warning to fascist aggressors, which also has a major warning effect on Germany and Italy. Conversely, for China and the broad peoples of Britain and France, it will be an unparalleled enthusiastic welcome and support because this is precisely the common demand of China, Britain, France, and even all peace-loving and just people in the world.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council is in session, and we should awaken the recognition of this new international situation among all representatives, accept our country's proposal to sanction Japan, and the appeal of the Spanish People's Republican Government. A more powerful and thorough decision to protect international justice should be made.</p>
<h3>"New Principles of Disaster Relief"</h3>
<p>This newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 16th stated that the Disaster Relief Committee has been meeting for several days and has decided on new principles for disaster relief. The main point is "All unemployed and impoverished people in the rear areas should receive the same relief as refugees from the front lines." This was originally a principle stipulated in the "Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction" adopted by the Kuomintang Provisional National Congress last year. It is only now that preparations are being made for actual implementation. Although it seems too late, it is indeed good news that is gratifying at this time of new beginnings in military, political, and popular movements. We hope that the government authorities will uphold the excellent policy of "implementing livelihood improvement during the war of resistance," adapt to the special needs of various regions and types, and implement it step by step. This will have a very significant effect on encouraging the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the war of resistance and the enthusiasm for production. At the same time, we hope that opinion leaders and professionals in various regions will assist the government in publicity and explanation, propose detailed methods for how to relieve the unemployed, impoverished, and refugees from the front lines, and pay special attention to actively organizing them into wartime production organizations in addition to passive relief. This will be even more beneficial to the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Eager to Serve the Nation: Over a Hundred Isolated Troops Secretly Leave the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp; 109 People Sneak Out Through the Ditch, 6 Intercepted; Judge Sympathizes with Isolated Troops' Patriotism, Sentences Them Lightly to Two Months in Prison</h3>
<p>More than nine hundred isolated Chinese troops, who mistakenly entered British territory after losing their way in battle in Shenzhen some time ago, were monitored by the Hong Kong authorities at the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp. Feeling that life in the camp was quite inconvenient, unfortunate incidents have occurred continuously in recent days. Recently, most of the isolated troops have secretly found ways to leave the camp on their own because they are eager to serve the nation. As of last Saturday, more than a hundred people had left the camp. At 1:30 AM yesterday, police officers on duty on Boundary Street discovered eight people who appeared to be four isolated troops gathering together. They went forward to inquire, and the eight people fled upon seeing the police. Six people were eventually captured by the police, while the other two escaped without a trace. The six people captured by the police were confirmed to be detained soldiers. It is reported that the soldiers who left the camp came out from the sluice gate on the side of the refugee camp and escaped through the large canal there. After the soldiers in the camp discovered this escape route, they did not need to clash with the Indian police to fight their way out. More than a hundred people have left the camp on their own, one after another.</p>
<p>Intercepted Isolated Troops: Six People Charged</p>
<p>The six isolated troops who were intercepted were brought to the Kowloon Magistracy yesterday morning and examined by Magistrate Hum and his wife. Kowloon City Police Station Assistant Superintendent Roger prosecuted. The charge was attempting to escape. All were sentenced to two months of hard labor imprisonment and, after the term, were sent back to the refugee camp for accommodation. The names of the accused isolated troops were Liang Hui (28 years old), Li Jia (26 years old), Ma Zhou (21 years old), Luo Er (23 years old), Wu Liangsheng (25 years old), and Huang Lizhou (23 years old). After the court opened, the prosecutor stated the cause of the case to the judge. At around 7:00 PM on the 13th of this month, 109 of the 900 Chinese troops residing at the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp crawled out of the ditch, intending to escape. At around 2:00 AM the next morning, the defendants and eight others escaped to Boundary Street in Kowloon Tong. Because they did not know the way, they wandered around and were discovered by the police on duty, who arrested them. Two of them escaped, and only the defendants were arrested. It was found that two Chinese soldiers residing there had previously attempted to leave the camp, which led to the Indian soldiers guarding the camp opening fire to stop them, and they were shot and killed. In order to prevent such incidents from happening again, the defendants should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Eager to Serve the Nation, Not Afraid of Danger</p>
<p>After listening to the confession, the judge asked the defendants about their motivation for leaving the camp and what they had to say in their defense. The third, fourth, and sixth defendants made passionate statements, saying that they had mistakenly entered British territory after losing their way in battle, which led to them being disarmed and watched. Although they had received full food, clothing, and shelter from the Hong Kong government for several months, they were soldiers and should dedicate themselves to the country. Now that the war of resistance against Japan is still going on, they cannot be complacent because they lack nothing in terms of food and clothing and forget their motherland. This time's escape was known to be slightly non-compliant with the procedures, but the purpose of the escape was to rejoin the ranks and participate in the killing of the enemy. Therefore, even if they risked trying to escape, they would not hesitate. There was no other plan. After listening to the confession, the judge expressed deep sympathy for the defendants' motives, saying to the defendants, "This court greatly sympathizes with your enthusiasm for patriotism. However, under the current circumstances, you cannot but wait quietly for the opportunity to serve in the future. In order to enforce Hong Kong law, this court will sentence you to two months of hard labor imprisonment lightly, and after the term, you will still be sent back to the camp for accommodation."</p>
<p>Secret Ditch Case: On-Site Inspection</p>
<p>The reporter also went to the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp for inspection yesterday afternoon, but was stopped by the camp police and could not enter. So, I went to the seaside to follow the escape route of the isolated troops and found a ditch mouth about 500 yards away from the refugee camp, which was used to discharge sewage into Kowloon Bay. It was the way out for the soldiers to escape through the ditch port. The canal is only 250 yards away from Shing Wong Street and is an open canal. It is only five feet above the ground. The reporter then followed the ditch straight into the refugee camp and learned that the camp was only 250 yards away from Shing Wong Street. The canal itself is very large, easy to enter and exit, and very cool, unlike ordinary ditches. Arriving at the camp, I saw a huge hole, about five feet in diameter, which could accommodate one person to enter and exit. The soldiers escaped from the hole, which has now been locked. The authorities have also sent troops to guard it.</p>
<p>It was found that in the past, some soldiers in the camp had attempted to escape, which was discovered by the Indian soldiers guarding the camp, who shot and killed two people and injured several others. The situation was quite serious. The future life adjustment and disposal of the imprisoned isolated troops has become a concern for all parties in Hong Kong. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited the army, government, police, and refugee camp management authorities in this alley to learn the truth of the incident. The person in charge of the refugee camp refused to express an opinion to the reporter. The army authorities asked the reporter to consult with the government. The police officer, Henry, admitted that the Chinese troops had left the refugee camp, but said that the details would not be released until after an investigation. The reporter, having gained no useful information, finally visited the Colonial Secretary, Smith, who made no indication of how to deal with the resettlement and treatment of the imprisoned troops in the future. Only he said that the Hong Kong authorities are paying close attention to the unfortunate incidents that have occurred in the refugee camp. The British government is in a neutral position on the Sino-Japanese War. This time, the guarding of the Chinese troops passing through the border is actually a measure that a neutral country should take.</p>

<h3>Our Authorities Notify Overseas Chinese to Strictly Guard Against Anti-Propaganda Documents; Overseas Chinese Should Immediately Report Any Received for Investigation</h3>
<p>×Since launching the war of aggression against China, [Japan] has suffered repeated and heavy blows from us. Therefore, it has repeatedly resorted to the trick of sowing discord, sending a large number of special agents to distribute [documents] in the Philippines and Nanyang, the places where most of our overseas Chinese reside, engaging in activities everywhere in an attempt to alienate the feelings between our overseas Chinese and the government. Currently, there are a large number of × country's special agents operating overseas, widely buying over traitors to serve their purposes. In addition to Wang [Jingwei]'s intention to send his henchmen to public places to carry out anti-China propaganda attacking our government and spread various absurd rumors in an attempt to confuse overseas Chinese, they also falsely use the names of overseas Chinese groups to forge all kinds of unfounded and absurd leaflets, which are distributed to local groups, shops, and gentry and merchants, deliberately alienating overseas Chinese who love their party and country in an attempt to divide the strength of the war of resistance. (Middle section censored). The scope of distribution of these divisive leaflets includes the occupied areas and various parts of Nanyang, and its greatest purpose is to alienate overseas Chinese from their enthusiasm for supporting the party and the country. Recently, a reactionary leaflet titled "The Crimes of the Kuomintang in Ruining the Country" was reprinted and distributed. The content is absurd and outrageous. Our central authorities have recently received reports from overseas Chinese and are paying close attention to this matter. The Overseas Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang has instructed the branches of the Overseas Department to strictly guard against this. The internal text of the notice roughly stated: "It has been reported by the directly affiliated branch in Perak that a reactionary leaflet titled "The Crimes of the Kuomintang in Ruining the Country" has been sent. The content is absurd and outrageous, deliberately alienating overseas Chinese who love their party and country, and dividing the strength of the war of resistance. Their intentions are sinister in the extreme. After investigation, the leaflet was issued from ××. In addition to ordering the directly affiliated branch in ×× to thoroughly investigate the printing agency, we also notify all levels of departments overseas to strictly guard against it and collect and report as much as possible. It is hereby ordered that the department comply with and handle the matter." After receiving the telegram from the Overseas Department, the branches in various overseas locations immediately complied with the order, paying close attention to the agency printing reactionary leaflets, and notified the overseas Chinese to cooperate and immediately report any reactionary documents with absurd wording that are deemed sufficient to damage the credibility of the government, alienate overseas Chinese from loving their party and country, and divide the strength of the war of resistance, so that they can be dealt with.</p>
<h3>The Jinshan Steamer Returns to Hong Kong This Morning; Future Routes Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, water and land transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou has been completely cut off for three months. Although the central government has repeatedly proposed opening the Pearl River, no results have been achieved. It was not until the 11th of this month that the Provincial, Hong Kong and Macao Steamboat Company sent the Jinshan Steamer to Guangzhou. It was found that 40 people took the boat to the province that day, including 35 Westerners and 5 Chinese. Two Westerners went to Shamian to serve, and the other three were cool-blooded merchants who returned to Guangzhou to resume their business. According to Mr. Russ, the manager of the company, told reporters yesterday that the Jinshan Steamer was the first and the first ship to sail to Guangzhou on the 11th of this month. The report that the Jinshan Steamer did not have any Chinese passengers going to the province is incorrect. The three Chinese went to the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong to obtain a pass before leaving Hong Kong, and also obtained an export certificate from the Hong Kong police authorities, and then went. By yesterday afternoon, the company's agent in Shamian sent a telegram saying that the Jinshan Steamer was scheduled to return from Guangzhou (this) morning and arrive at about 3 pm. The telegram did not mention how many passengers and their nationalities would be on this return trip. Mr. Russ further stated that the future voyage of the Jinshan Steamer has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Our Valiant Air Force: A Witness Account from Humen; Sunk a × Battleship in the Pearl River</h3>
<p>A previous report in a Hong Kong English-language weekly published a message that our planes bombed the × battleship in the Pearl River. The report stated: Yesterday morning, the 14th, the Chinese Air Force suddenly appeared over the Pearl River in Guangzhou and launched a large-scale bombing of Japanese warships. Two Japanese warships were sunk. This news is difficult to verify, but recently the Chinese Air Force has been very active in South China. After the publication of this news, Chinese and foreign people here have paid close attention to the truth of the matter. Yesterday, a visitor who withdrew from the occupied area of Humen and arrived in Hong Kong testified to reporters about this matter, but the time was on New Year's Eve last year, not on the 14th of this month. According to the account of a witness of the incident is as follows: The × battleship that invaded the Pearl River was completely unprepared for our air force. Early in the morning on December 31st last year, the sound of engines was suddenly heard over the small Tiger surface of the Pearl River. Our divine eagles with three wings suddenly appeared from afar. At that time, there were four × battleships in the river. When our plane flew over, the × battleships scattered in panic. Because they were unprepared, Zhu You did not counterattack. Our plane dropped four bombs in a row from an altitude of about 3,000 feet. One of the × battleships was hit and sank immediately. Our plane dropped a single bomb to bomb other × battleships before flying north. After the × battleship sank, the tail fell into the river, and the bow protruded from the water. The number 24 could still be seen from a distance on the shore. After the × battleship sank, the people in the ship floated on the sea, and other × frantically rescued them. The situation was extremely embarrassing. A lot of × corpses floated on the surface of the water the next day. It is believed that the number of people killed in the bombing must be quite a few. After the incident, the × battleship released balloons into the air every day to prevent it. Recently, our planes have frequently appeared over the Pearl River, but there have been no bombings.</p>
<h3>The Cantonese-Hong Kong YMCA</h3>
<p>—Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Departure Flag-Granting Ceremony of the Military Service Corps; Wishing Excellent Young People to Continue to Serve on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Special Article for This Newspaper</p>
<p>The flow of heat and energy permeated the YMCA gymnasium from 7:30 pm to 11:00 pm the day before yesterday. The reporter felt that descriptive terms such as "blood rushing" and "pulse throbbing" still could not accurately capture the true grandeur of the Departure Flag-Granting Ceremony of the Military Service Corps. Only a sound film could fully capture this scene, allowing those who did not personally attend the event to believe in yet another concrete testament to the patriotism of our Hong Kong compatriots and the invincibility of China.</p>
<p>The flags presented by various sectors, in all sizes, numbered over thirty, fluttering in the wind with colorful crepe paper. A large national flag hung above the basketball rack. On either side of Sun Yat-sen's portrait hung the couplets: "Go to the Front Lines, to Serve the Soldiers Fighting Valiantly" and "Donate Supplies, to Sacrifice for the Nation's Resistance." Men and women, young and old, crowded the solemn and magnificent venue.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bright lights went out, and everyone was surprised and fearful of the arrival of darkness. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that a blazing torch led twenty-three imposing, armed, young men and women "Tatatata..." into the center of the venue. The lights returned, and thunderous applause of welcome and respect resonated for a long time.</p>
<p>After singing the national anthem and performing the rituals, Bishop He Minghua offered prayers and blessings. Several Westerners attended, and the sympathy of international friends was, of course, greatly appreciated. The opening speech was given by Mr. Lin Zifeng, the chairman of the corps, who stated, in essence: "Two million soldiers are fighting to protect the country, and it is our undeniable duty as civilians in the rear to come forward and serve. The YMCA has dispatched the first and second Military Service Corps to serve in the forces of Ye Zhao, Wu Qiyi, Shang Zhen, and others, where they have worked to establish officer clubs, serve the wounded, educate the rear, the public, and children, conduct propaganda, and provide medical assistance... Now that the military authorities have allocated over two hundred thousand soldiers within the service scope of this corps, the dispatch of the third and fourth corps to serve on the front lines is still insufficient. It is hoped that a fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth corps will continue to be dispatched to serve, and that the sweat of the people will combine with the blood of the soldiers to ensure final victory." Upon hearing the word "victory," everyone applauded.</p>
<p>After the oath, Mr. Huang Maolin, the vice chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, presented the flag and delivered a speech on behalf of all sectors of Hong Kong. Following this, the entire group sang the National General Mobilization song, with everyone forgetting themselves and wishing they could immediately rush to the front lines.</p>
<p>The flag-presentation ceremony began with Mr. Jiang Faxian, the director of the South China region of the Lianqing Society, presenting a flag. Then, various organizations and schools successively presented items, and the applause thundered again and again. These items truly represented the boundless respect of the rear-area population.</p>
<p>Speeches were given by Mr. Tan Jidong, the chairman of the corps, and Mr. Li Yinglin, the president of Lingnan University. President Li said, "...Previously, when the youth of Guangzhou went to the train station to welcome the soldiers going to the front lines, the soldiers said, 'To receive such a send-off, even death is worth it!' Now, going to the front lines to serve will certainly encourage morale..." Everyone felt that our soldiers and civilians should be closely united, inspiring and encouraging each other.</p>
<p>With the encouragement of the principal, three students and a military instructor from Pui To Middle School participated in the Military Service Corps. In order to encourage and inspire them, the chairman specially invited Mr. Wen Yaobin, the principal of the school, to speak on the stage, and the whole audience applauded warmly again. A reasonable society should support those who contribute to society in this way; the honor that everyone receives in society should be based on their contributions to society. This standard of good and evil is worth promoting. While applauding, the reporter hoped to applaud more such principals.</p>
<p>As the program continued, Mr. Deng Jinhui, the leader of the corps, delivered a thank-you speech. The joint singing group of the YMCA and other singing groups sang, and the atmosphere was solemn, tense, and lively. In his report, Zhao Ganlin, the secretary of the YMCA, also introduced the elderly mother of Mr. Deng Huixiang, the team leader who was about to lead the team north, to everyone for applause and respect. Team Leader Deng bowed and thanked everyone politely. The kind and amiable Mother Zheng told reporters, "The country has reached this stage, so let him be a son of the country. A strong country is needed for a home, and I am old and useless, so I can only hope that my son will do his best for the country..." The audience was deeply moved and paid their respects. If Mr. Tao Xingzhi knew about this living "story," he would definitely write a new poem about "Mother Zhao of Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Next was a performance by all the members of the corps, showcasing the various skills and defenses that the corps would bring to the front lines to serve the soldiers. First was singing, with a joint performance of seven or eight songs to save the nation. They were all majestic and passionate. In particular, the lyrics of "China Will Not Perish" were clearer and brighter, making it the most moving song. Second was illusion, and the master of ceremonies caused the audience to burst into laughter when he asked the audience upstairs and on both sides not to laugh at the secrets of the performance. The third was a first-aid performance, and the bandage and emergency performances in each section were accurate and quick. The last was drama, performing "Blind and Mute Hatred." Although the person playing the mute was not serious enough and deviated from the plot, the old man, Sifeng, the drunkard, and spectators A and B all performed very realistically and vividly, and the performance was generally successful. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××"! Everyone shouted several times in a row, and the applause thundered again. In the midst of the high tide of hatred of the enemy and love of the country, everyone sang "Defend China" together, which was truly a cry from the bottom of their hearts. In the heat and energy flowing around them, everyone's blood was rushing and their pulses were throbbing rapidly.</p>
<p>In the melodious and majestic music, everyone put all the banknotes, dimes, and pennies in their pockets into the donation box before leaving the venue to cover the expenses of the corps' departure north. There was no licentiousness, but solemnity; no stinginess, but generosity; no cowardice, but bravery; no decadence, but tension; no senility, but vitality... Of course, there are many, many more such scenes in China and among overseas Chinese. But we hope that this kind of great deed will continue to happen, and that the Chinese nation will be reborn.</p>
<p>Finally, with high-spirited enthusiasm, we pay our respects to the National Liberation of the Military Service Corps of the Cantonese-Hong Kong YMCA, and wish them well for the country!</p>
<h3>Report by Representative of China Industrial Cooperative Association: Rear Area Industry During Wartime; Significant Achievements Have Been Made in Dividing the Country into Three Major Industrial Zones; Establishing an Industrial Zone Office in Hong Kong to Develop Southwest Industry</h3>
<p>Special Article</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said when discussing the protracted war of resistance: "The struggle for the final victory of the protracted war of resistance must involve the mobilization of the entire people. In addition to replenishing the army, we must also pay attention to the development of industry so that all the military supplies needed for the army's operations can be self-sufficient. In the past, China's industry was developed abnormally, mostly concentrated in coastal towns, and now most of it has fallen into × hands; without industry, we cannot fight and we cannot become a free and independent country; therefore, in order for China to support the protracted war of resistance and to establish an economic foundation after the war, it must establish new industries during wartime."</p>
<p>The China Industrial Cooperative Association was established based on the above-mentioned opinions of Chairman Chiang. In July of this year, the first office was officially established in Baoji County, Shaanxi, in the Northwest Region. Under the cultivation of President Kong of the Executive Yuan, it gradually grew. The Southeast (Hubei), Southwest (Hunan), and Northwest (Sichuan) offices were subsequently established. Its fund is five million yuan, and the annual operating expenses are fifty thousand yuan, which are fully subsidized by the Executive Yuan. Under this great organization, their hope is to have a total of 30,000 fruits in the future.</p>
<p>In order to make this hope a reality, one of their staff members, Mr. Lu Guangqiao, and a foreign friend, Ms. Pu Yihua De, who volunteered to serve our country, have been dispatched to Hong Kong a few days ago to discuss and contact various relief organizations in Hong Kong, and prepare to establish offices in the Pearl River Basin.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Branch of the Women's Comfort Association, in order to make the organization of the China Industrial Cooperative Society clear to the public, specially invited gentry, merchants and giants to gather at the Chinese Merchants Club at 3 pm yesterday to introduce Mr. Lu and Ms. Pu to meet, and invited Mr. Lu to report on "The origin and development of the China Industrial Cooperative Association and its future progress." More than thirty people attended the meeting, and Chinese representatives Luo Xuhe, Luo Wenjin, and Bishop He Minghua also attended the grand meeting, which shows the importance that Hong Kong compatriots attach to this organization.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Guangmian's robust body and brown face conceal a lean spirit. After being introduced by Chairman He Ailing, he began his report. According to him, the origin of this great organization is based on Chairman Chiang's views, and at the same time, their founders also identified several conditions that will definitely be successful in the future before weaving: (1) Refugees and skilled workers who have withdrawn from the occupied areas are everywhere, and can be used to engage in production, (2) The raw materials of various industrial products in the mainland. Such as cotton yarn, wool, leather, etc. have no sales outlets and prices are extremely low, while at the same time the prices of various industrial products are surprisingly high, and these raw materials can be used to manufacture industrial products; (3) Industrial products do not have the competition of imported products in the market, and this is the time to establish the foundation of China's new industries. As a result, this industrial cooperative was born amidst the difficulties and hardships during the war of resistance!</p>
<p>The mission of the China Industrial Cooperative Society is to increase production in the rear, establish an industrial base after the war, strive for final victory, and build a new China of equality and freedom in the process of the protracted war of resistance. Since its establishment, it has successively established four regional offices in Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, namely Southwest, Southeast, West China, and Northwest, and has actively carried out work. Since the Northwest Regional Office was established in Baoji in late August last year, it has begun to divide and lead investigations into the local raw materials and industrial needs, collect refugees, unemployed workers, and technicians to organize various industrial cooperatives. More than 30 industries have been established, and there are still more than 30 industries being organized. In addition to various light industries, we have paid more attention to the establishment of small-scale heavy industries, such as coal mining, iron smelting, alcohol, and triacid industries, which are all being planned separately.</p>
<p>The experience of the past two months tells us that the raw materials and output of various light and heavy industries in the Northwest are very abundant, but unfortunately the goods are abandoned on the ground and no one uses them. Now that my country's war of resistance has entered the fourth stage, the need for military industrial products and rear-area T industrial products is becoming increasingly urgent, and the development of Northwest resources is an urgent task. However, there are too many industrial sectors and the Northwest is too large. This major task of T industry construction cannot be fully undertaken by a few people or a few public and private groups. All parties must join hands and work together to hope to achieve something in a short period of time, so we hope that people from all walks of life in society, especially specialists with technical experience, can directly or indirectly participate in this industrial cooperation movement to consolidate the rear economic national defense. We also hope that military agencies, local authorities, and the media and financial communities can separately and actively provide necessary support and encouragement to this movement!</p>
<p>Here I have one more point worth reporting to the public, that is, in the process of organization, Mr. Alley, a foreign friend, has provided a lot of help. Mr. Alley is most sympathetic to our country, and he voluntarily gave up his position at the Shanghai Public Concession to participate in an organization. He believes that this move has fulfilled his wish to serve our country day and night, and he is now serving as the technical guidance commissioner of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's report was presented in Mandarin and English. Chairman He Ailing was deeply afraid that the audience might not understand, and repeated it in Cantonese. According to Mr. Lu's final statement, he hopes to establish an industrial zone in Hong Kong, so that refugees and unemployed workers who have fled to Hong Kong can participate in wartime production and develop the industry in the southwest. The Association's Industrial Zone Office in Hong Kong is now located in the Women's Comfort Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Xuhe, in his capacity as the chief Chinese representative, expressed his full support for the China Cooperative Society ancestral movement on behalf of all Hong Kong compatriots. He believes that this organization can not only relieve refugees of unemployment, but also be the foundation for China's revival. He said, "Why not do it"? He also believes that Mr. Lu's desire to establish an industrial zone for the association in Hong Kong is an urgent need.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the propertied compatriots in Hong Kong will deeply understand the importance of wartime industrial music, and will work together to shoulder this great mission!</p>

<p>Traffic and Travel</p>
<h3>From Hunan to Shanghai: Observations Along the Jinhua-Ji'an Route - People's Efforts in Industrial Cooperation to Solve the Refugee Problem</h3>
<p>The Shanghai "Chinese-Foreign Newspaper" reports: The following is based on the notes of a traveler recently returned to Shanghai from near Changsha, describing the efforts of the Chinese government and people to organize 30,000 industrial cooperatives to solve the refugee problem and revitalize the country.</p>
<p>In the evening, the train left Changsha and headed east for Jinhua, a journey of two or three days. When we departed, we saw hundreds of male and female laborers clearing rubble from the streets and collecting debris from the ruins. Changsha originally had a population of 500,000, but most of them had fled. The train was full of passengers and luggage, with only a small number of Changsha residents returning to inspect their property. They knew they could not stay and were heading elsewhere, but it was unclear why they were going east, as most refugees were heading west. Traveling south from near Changsha along the Yuehan Railway, Shaoyang in southwestern Hunan was a gathering place, as it was the terminus for long-distance buses and a refugee center. The train did not reach Nanchang, but stopped at Zhangshu on the Gan River, about 45 miles south of Nanchang. I left the train for the usual inspection of luggage and credentials. Zhangshu often had fears of spies, so the inspectors paid special attention to maps and photographs. From Zhangshu, I took a long-distance bus south to Ji'an to meet with several merchants. The highway wound through the steep mountains of the Gan River basin. In the summer, this was a rice and tea-producing area, but now it was planted with soybeans and wheat. People were walking everywhere, mostly refugees from the Yangtze River basin, resting by the roadside, or traveling by rickshaw or wheelbarrow, or simply walking. Ji'an is now quite prosperous. A tea merchant described how the authorities were taking care of the refugees, saying that two weeks ago, one Chinese and one foreigner went to Ji'an to post notices about industrial cooperatives and recruit workers. The local people had been unable to transport their tea and linen from Nanchang and Jiujiang, so they and a large number of refugees were overjoyed to hear the news. After the notices were posted, many people applied. After discussions, the cooperative office began to provide loans and start work. Soon, I went to a small street office to inquire and met the two people leading the movement. Although they were extremely busy, they were very welcoming, invited me to dine, and offered me lodging, as the long-distance bus back to Zhangshu was not running that day. The foreigner was Mr. Holcomb, and the Chinese was Ms. Li Wanpei (transliteration). Both had worked as engineers in Guangzhou and joined the cooperative at the invitation of the Industrial Cooperatives Association. We ate Chinese food, and during the meal, they both spoke enthusiastically about the progress of their work. In this wealthy but backward Jiangxi province, they were starting essential industries. They were working closely with the Jiangxi Refugee Relief Federation and the Rural Reconstruction Bureau, designating the area south of Taihe for refugee resettlement. However, the current need is only for a small portion of agricultural products. As the external supply sources for the people in the area have been cut off, there is an increasing need for a large amount of goods. To meet this need, the industrial cooperative movement was started. The people can work, and there are many who need goods. Because there are a large number of raw materials in the area, and the resources have not yet been exploited, the movement is going very smoothly. According to Mr. Holcomb, the area is quite wealthy, but the people are conservative. Iron, coal, lead, zinc, manganese, tungsten, silver, gold, pigments, linen, and tobacco are produced, but there is a lack of machinery. I asked what progress had been made so far. Mr. Holcomb said that since August 1938, there have been four headquarters and more than 100 cooperatives. The plan is to develop local resources as much as possible. Because transportation is inconvenient, the Ji'an Cooperative has started to manufacture straw sandals, boats, matches, paper, extract oil from tea and plant seeds, and weave fine cloth from ramie and cotton. After dinner, the three of us went to the general office and visited a cooperative workshop that manufactures small boats. The workshop was on the riverbank, with about 30 workers manufacturing sampans. The foreman was an experienced shipbuilder who had worked in Hangzhou and came here to lead the workers. The Ji'an office lent him 850 yuan for a period of one year, which he used to purchase wood and start building boats. Because the river was prosperous, there was a great demand for boats. After deducting expenses, the workers shared the remaining money, so they worked very hard. In the afternoon, I took a trip to the rural suburbs in the mountains. The villages were very quiet and had not yet experienced the horrors of war. Local farmers said that the war was still far away, and if the [Japanese] army arrived, they would resist. The next morning, I took a long-distance bus north back to Zhangshu. The area was now very busy with military defense and railway transportation. From Zhangshu, I took a small train to Jinhua, which has now been converted into the provincial capital of Zhejiang. Various government offices are now located there. From there, I took a long-distance bus and a small boat to Ningbo, and then took a steamer back to Shanghai. The six-day journey came to an end.</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan Ji'nan Troops Are Increasingly Active - Inland River Traffic Is Again Cut Off - Two [Japanese] Small Steamers Intercepted at Qingyang Port</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The Chinese guerrilla forces have recently been quite active in the Qingpu-Shanghai highway area, and from time to time they launch surprise attacks on the railways and important waterways during [Japanese] transport, which have been quite effective. The [Japanese] forces have suffered heavy losses and are exhausted. On New Year's Day, two [Japanese] small steamers, towing six civilian ships, fully loaded with military supplies, passed through the Qingyang Port area and were surrounded and intercepted by a large guerrilla force. The [Japanese] suffered heavy casualties, and all the ships and cargo were seized by the Chinese army. Only two [Japanese] merchants, along with the shipowner, escaped back to Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, the [Japanese] authorities dispatched 200 Japanese soldiers to the Qingpu-Shanghai highway area yesterday at midnight in an attempt to "encircle and suppress" the guerrillas. At the same time, due to the unrest on the inland river lines, they strictly ordered all civilian ships to suspend navigation to prevent attacks. As a result, inland river traffic was completely cut off again yesterday, and the operating losses suffered by the shipping companies were not small.</p>
<p>Inland River Blockade</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that after the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, a [Japanese] merchant, implemented control over inland river navigation rights and dispatched ships, the guerrillas in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have recently begun to actively operate. The voyages have been repeatedly detained or attacked, making it extremely difficult to navigate. In order to prevent guerrilla activity, the [Japanese] have implemented a blockade of the inland rivers. The shipping companies have also stopped operating due to the danger of navigation and the light passenger and freight traffic. Inland river services have been completely suspended, and there have been no voyages in the past few days.</p>
<p>Passenger and Freight Interruption</p>
<p>According to news from the inland river shipping industry, the recent activity of guerrillas in the interior is in full swing, and inland river services have been severely hit. Therefore, ships returning to Shanghai from the interior are being blocked due to the danger along the way, and some waterways have been blocked. There are many ships blocked in the interior, especially in western Zhejiang, mostly cargo ships. As a result, passenger and freight transport to and from the interior has been completely suspended.</p>
<p>Civilian Navigation</p>
<p>Before the complete suspension of inland river services, the number of voyages was reduced due to the unrest in the interior, and civilian ship services emerged. Civilian ships traveled to and from various lines one after another. However, recently, due to the blockade of inland waterways, civilian ships have also been forced to completely suspend operations, making inland transportation increasingly difficult. According to the shipping companies, the waterways will be opened and services will be restored as soon as the situation is slightly stable.</p>
<p>Suburban Shanghai Suspensions</p>
<p>The inland river services from Shanghai to the northern suburbs of Shanghai, Beixinjing, Kaixing, Yexie, Songjiang, Xindai, Zhulai Temple, Qingpu, Kunshan, Jiaozhi, and other places have always been more numerous than elsewhere. Although the voyages to various places are sometimes affected by suspensions, the suburbs can still barely maintain operations. However, in recent days, guerrilla activity has been extremely active in various places in the suburbs, launching attacks from time to time, causing the services on various lines to be interrupted.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Actively Preparing to Open Arctic Air Route to America - Three Giant Passenger Planes Under Construction</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union has not abandoned its plan for a passenger air route from Moscow via the Arctic to the United States. Three large, three-engine aircraft are currently under construction, designed to accommodate 42 passengers and six crew members, for use on this route. The aircraft are expected to be completed by May of this year and will first undergo test flights on the Moscow-Vladivostok route, then fly to the United States via the Arctic.</p>
<h3>Western Correspondent Investigates All Aspects of Hankou - People Cannot Make a Living, Foreigners Greatly Affected - Oppression and Abuse, [Japanese] Do Whatever They Want</h3>
<p>A correspondent from the Shanghai "Chinese-Foreign Newspaper" sends the following dispatch after investigating Hankou: When Hankou fell, the population was 150,000, only one-fifth of the normal population. The huge reduction in the number of residents exceeded anyone's expectations. The normal population in the concessions was 40,000. When the [Japanese] army arrived in Hankou, these 150,000 survivors were confined to the concessions. The first step taken by the [Japanese] was to establish a refugee area in the poorest area two miles from the concession. This area, called Wusheng Temple (transliteration), has become the most densely populated area, now estimated to have a population of 90,000 to 100,000. The remainder are scattered in the French Concession and the First, Second, and Third Special Areas. There is no shortage of rice for the Chinese, which is thanks to the foresight of the Refugee Committee. Fresh vegetables are also quite plentiful. The villagers plant five grains as quickly as possible. Because the new grains are not immediately harvested, a shortage of food is unavoidable. Fresh meat is still considered plentiful, but like vegetables, this is not a healthy sign, as livestock are being slaughtered and are gradually becoming scarce. Most of the Chinese areas of Hankou remain desolate. Before the Chinese army abandoned Hankou, they destroyed the Japanese concession and the municipal government's buildings. Apart from this, everything in the three towns of Wuhan was damaged. Since the Chinese army withdrew, large fires have occurred continuously in the Chinese areas, and most of them have been burned down. Only the refugee area was completely unaffected by the fire. The [Japanese] army transported all valuables from the area outside the concession, and the remainder was used as firewood. [Japanese] sentries often rob money when searching Chinese pedestrians, which has been repeatedly confirmed. Rapes are often heard. The refugee area is guaranteed safe by the [Japanese] military police, so there is less harassment. However, the situation in Wuchang is very different. The [Japanese] military authorities not only refuse to allow churches to work to relieve refugees, but also want to evict more than 6,000 refugees from the church's large houses. When they failed to achieve their wishes, they used extreme measures to prevent the refugees from obtaining food and drink, causing them to gradually starve to death. In the countryside outside Hankou, the safety of boys and children and their livestock is not guaranteed. Shocking news is coming from the countryside, such as the burning of houses and the seizure of property. The increasing number of people traveling up the Han River and entering the refugee area is proof of this. Chinese people must have identity cards in order to live and move freely, but the [Japanese] do not issue these cards to everyone. For example, Chinese people living in certain foreign-owned houses are refused these cards, because the [Japanese] are eager to force the Chinese to move out and use the houses themselves. The goal of the [Japanese] is to make the Chinese return to their homes, but their various actions have made it impossible to achieve this goal. The abuse of pedestrians, the failure to issue travel permits to those temporarily residing in the French Concession, the various restrictions on the freedom of movement of residents, vehicles, and goods, the destruction of industry, and the violence against villagers have all prevented Hankou from returning to its original state as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Sights and Sounds Along the Guangdong-Guangxi Road After the Fall of Guangzhou (2) - Japanese Troops Disturb Various Cities and Towns Along the West River - Guangxi Troops Move East to Strengthen the Consolidated Defense Line</h3>
<p>On the 24th, the reporter left Guanshan again and traveled west, taking the route through Taiping and Sanzhou and entering Gaoming. This place is closer to Guangzhou and is located on the West River. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, they did not have time to advance here, so everything seen along the way was very peaceful. However, refugees fleeing this way have numbered three to several hundred per day since the 20th, either in groups of three or five, or in groups of hundreds. Those who took this route mostly scattered back to their hometowns or took the Yaoming Highway bus to Zhaoqing, going upstream along the West River to enter Guangxi. This road is far to the west and not a major transportation route, so it can avoid the pursuit of Japanese aircraft. When the reporter arrived in Gaoming, he heard that Chencun had been invaded by more than 100 Japanese troops from Weiyong and Lezhu on the morning of the 24th, and a conflict had occurred with the local self-defense forces. Chencun Old Market was first broken through by the Japanese army, and more than 100 shops and residences were burned. The Japanese army then occupied the New Market and Bijiang. Unscrupulous elements lurking in the old and new markets took the opportunity to rob, and the entire market suffered losses of more than two to three million yuan. Two salt boats on the river were intercepted, and more than 200 civilians died. On the same day, Daliang (the county seat of Shunde) also fell. On the 26th, the Southwest Market (under the jurisdiction of Sanshui) was set on fire again, burning for a day and night without being extinguished. It is said that after the Japanese army entered Guangzhou, they sent planes to Foshan, Daliang, Southwest, Sanshui, Qingyuan, and other places for several days from the 23rd to the 25th, bombing incessantly all day long. Its land army advanced along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road towards Foshan, Southwest, and Sanshui, while using small steamers to transport Japanese troops to attack Foshan and Southwest. According to merchants who fled from Foshan to Gaoming, the Japanese army entered Foshan on the 25th. One battalion of the security team stationed there had already withdrawn to Sanshui, Sihui, and other areas, so when the Japanese army arrived, only the self-defense forces resisted slightly, and then retreated into the countryside, without any fierce contact. However, after being bombed by planes for several consecutive days, shops and residences near the station, and various match factories, were mostly bombed and destroyed, about a hundred rooms or so. The Southwest Market was attacked by hundreds of Japanese troops early on the 26th. That night, a large fire and looting occurred, and more than 80% of the shops in the entire market were burned. Qingyuan County Town was bombed by more than 20 Japanese aircraft on the 23rd, and incendiary bombs were dropped. The fire burned from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., destroying 300-400 shops, and the entire city was almost scorched earth. After the fall of Southwest, the Japanese army extended to the Sanshui River mouth and completely occupied the Guangzhou-Sanshui Line.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the reporter traveled from Gaoming to Baitu Market and then from Baitu Market to Shengqing. At that time, Sanshui and the River Mouth had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and water transport downstream of Zhaoqing was completely cut off. It was said that the Japanese army occupying Sanshui sent teams to break into the countryside for several consecutive days, levying civilian laborers and building fortifications, extremely busy, and in a posture of defending the area to resist the counterattack of our West River army. Later, on November 5th and 6th, the reporter received a fast letter from the River Mouth in Wuzhou, saying that the Japanese army had transferred more than 20 warships from Guangzhou to the River Mouth to strengthen their defenses. At the same time, hundreds of land troops occupied Makou and Jinli Market (under the jurisdiction of Gaoyao) opposite Makou. A pontoon bridge was erected from Makou to connect Jinli, so that the north and south banks could be connected. The West River was cut off and occupied. The Japanese army attached great importance to this, and the various rural markets, in view of the tragic bombing and burning, mostly moved out their entire families and cleared the fields, as a passive resistance. The [Japanese] army needed a large amount of food every day, and lacking supplies, they sent troops to search for grain and rice in the villages in Jinli, Dongbao, and Lucun. The self-defense forces of various villages, due to their personal and family interests, once joined forces to resist. After a day of fierce fighting, Maibian Village and Lucun in Jinli Market were set on fire and burned by the [Japanese] army. The [Japanese] army still occupies both banks of Jinli and Makou, and several watercraft, rubber boats, shallow-water motorboats, and small warships are moored on the Makou River, totaling dozens, to block the large Chinese army from Zhaoqing heading east. Airplanes are sent every day to bomb the counties of Guangning, Sihui, and Xinxing upstream on the West River.</p>
<p>A friend who fled from Zhaoqing to Wuzhou said that on November 23, nine [Japanese] aircraft flew to Zhaoqing City and Baitu Market (about 20 miles from Zhaoqing across the river) and dropped bombs. A total of more than 20 bombs were dropped on the riverside of the South Gate of Zhaoqing, and several incendiary bombs were dropped, destroying a Suichang tugboat, a Shengxin tugboat, a Portuguese kerosene barge, and two cargo ships, killing and injuring more than a dozen boat people. More than a dozen bombs were dropped on Baitu Market, killing 34 men, injuring 20, killing 24 women, injuring 13, destroying one rice mill, and collapsing five houses. The day was the date of the Baitu Market fair, and many villagers gathered to take advantage of the market, so the deaths were so tragic. On November 25, the Chinese army stationed in Zhaoqing detoured and attacked the [Japanese] army in Jinli. On the 26th, they repelled the [Japanese] army and destroyed a [Japanese] pontoon bridge. The [Japanese] army in Jinli then retreated to Makou and confronted the Chinese army across the river.</p>
<p>Several days before the reporter arrived in Zhaoqing, the Joint Inspection Office of the military and police stationed in Zhaoqing ordered the evacuation of the elderly, weak, women, and children back to their hometowns. Most of the shops stopped operating and were completely in a state of war. The remaining troops were completely dispatched to the key areas along the Zhaoqing Gorge to set up defenses.

<h3>Stabilizing the Market Gold Price After Controlling Gold - Preventing Gold Outflow and Eliminating Speculation - Directly Increasing My Country's Foreign Exchange Fund</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the outflow of gold and eliminate speculation, our government has implemented gold control measures. In addition to promulgating measures for exchanging legal tender, it also supervises the measures for silver shops to collect gold, aiming to stabilize the market gold price and increase foreign exchange funds. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Stabilizing Prices After the war, silver shops and gold shops in various places took advantage of the opportunity to raise or lower gold prices from time to time for their own private gain. As a result, domestic gold prices have been soaring, and their prices have exceeded world gold prices or Hong Kong gold prices, disrupting the financial market and hindering the future of the war of resistance. The measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance specify that the price of gold ornaments should be based on the value agreed upon by the silver shop and the Central Bank or the China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks, in order to prohibit arbitrary raising or lowering of prices and stabilize the market gold price.</p>
<p>Increasing Funds The measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance stipulate that all gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, placer gold, ore gold, and gold without the shape of ornaments stored in the country should be sold to the Central Bank to directly increase foreign exchange funds and indirectly protect the credit of legal tender. However, in order to take into account the business of merchants and people, silver shops are still allowed to continue to collect and sell red gold and 90% gold raw gold in the shape of ornaments and utensils, and may be entrusted by the Central Bank to collect gold without the shape of ornaments and utensils, as well as placer gold and ore gold.</p>
<p>Civilian Freedom The central government has promoted the national thrift movement in many ways, but the people still follow old habits, using gold for ornaments and various utensils, or storing gold in cellars and shipping it abroad, which violates the principle of thrift and hinders the strength of the war of resistance. The government stipulates that gold without the shape of ornaments and utensils stored by the people should be sold to the Central Bank, while gold with the shape of ornaments and utensils is still allowed for the people to buy and sell freely in silver shops, or to process and transform it. This means that while preventing cash from escaping, it still accommodates the habits of the people.</p>
<h3>The Stock Market Is Desolate - No Turnaround Yesterday - Prices Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong stock market remained depressed and there was still no turnaround. There were no large transactions throughout the day, only sporadic small numbers to add a little life to the scene. Although the buying and selling bids were strong, those who wanted to sell had no intention of buying, and vice versa.

<h3>Li Hua Cup Football Preliminary Round: Western Team Lineup Confirmed, Slight Changes from Previously Planned</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Li Hua Cup, one of the six championships, will hold its preliminary rounds on the 21st (Saturday) and 22nd (Sunday) of this month.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the Western Staff United Team will play against the Army United Team at the Kowloon Club Ground. On the 22nd, the Chinese United Team will play against the Navy United Team at the Hong Kong Football Club Ground. Both matches will start at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>This competition uses a knockout system. The match time is 90 minutes. If the score is still tied after the regulation time, there will be an extra 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In the past 14 sessions, the Western Staff Team has won the championship 7 times, the Army United Team 4 times, and the Chinese United Team 3 times.</p>
<p>Last year, the Chinese team had the possibility of winning all six championships, but unfortunately, in the Li Hua Cup final, the Chinese United Team was defeated by the Army United Team due to incomplete lineup of strong players.</p>
<p>For this Sunday's preliminary round match between the Chinese United Team and the Navy United Team, the Chinese team's side feels that the lineup decided a few days ago is imperfect because players from South China team are on tour and unable to return in time. Moreover, the Navy United Team currently has abundant talents and is very strong. There are concerns that the Chinese United Team will face more risks than opportunities this time.</p>
<p>The Football Association prioritizes "business acumen" and has also expressed dissatisfaction with the Chinese United Team's lineup. Although South China team has urgently telegraphed Saigon to request reinforcements, whether several players can be transferred back to respond to the match is still questionable.</p>
<p>The Western Staff Team's representatives have been discussed and proposed by the General Association and various committees related to this team, and the opinions of the relevant associations have been sought separately. If there are no objections, it will be considered final. The proposed lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Goulus (Hong Kong Football Club)</p>
<p>Biliban (Police Recreation Club), Remidi (St. Joseph's)</p>
<p>Yishi Dulanqi (Hong Kong Football Club), Belishi (Kowloon Cricket Club), Norf (Police Recreation Club)</p>
<p>Liao Yachen (Kowloon Cricket Club), Hou Lu (Police Recreation Club), Li Anna (St. Joseph's), Zuo Zhi (Kowloon Cricket Club), Di Bailu (Police Recreation Club)</p>
<p>Remidi of St. Joseph's, like Da Gao Shan Nu and Bi Ludu, only participates in international matches representing Portugal and league and special silver shield matches for St. Joseph's. He does not participate in any other competitions. Therefore, no player from St. Joseph's is listed on the official lineup of the Western Staff Team. Biliban of the Police Recreation Club is also unable to enter the starting lineup due to a foot injury and is only listed as a substitute. After discussion, the official lineup of the Western Staff Team is as follows:</p>
<p>Goulus (Hong Kong Football Club)</p>
<p>Wulieqi (Kowloon Cricket Club), Pa Jia (Police Recreation Club)</p>
<p>Hanni Bo (Kowloon Cricket Club), Belishi (Kowloon Cricket Club), Norf (Police Recreation Club)</p>
<p>Liao Yachen (Kowloon Cricket Club), Hou Lu (Police Recreation Club), Fu La (Hong Kong Football Club), Zuo Zhi (Kowloon Cricket Club), Di Bailu (Hong Kong Football Club)</p>
<p>Substitutes: A Jian Shi, Biliban, Mo Shi (Police Recreation Club), Yishi Wen, Nuo Shi (Kowloon Cricket Club)</p>

<h3>Last Night's Women's Basketball Match: Southwest Team Overwhelms Overseas Chinese Team; Mei Fang Scores Two Points, South China Team Defeats Snowflake Team</h3>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) Since the main battle between Mei Fang and Pei Dao was held last Saturday, the fitness room has gradually become deserted. Last night, according to the schedule, there were supposed to be three matches, but because Hong Kong University withdrew, there were only two matches in the end.</p>
<p>Before the war god arrived, most people were sure that the Southwest team was no match for the Overseas Chinese team in the first match, but after a fierce battle, the Southwest team overwhelmed the Overseas Chinese team.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first quarter, the Overseas Chinese team took the offensive. Su Zhen and Chan successively committed fouls, and Yingqi opened the scoring. Shouguang scored a free throw, taking a 3-0 lead, and applause broke out. In the blink of an eye, Huizhen committed a foul and was penalized, and Qianqian returned one point. After that, although Shouguang gained some points, Ruixin and Zhiji frequently returned the favor. At the end of the first quarter, the score was tied at 7-7.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, the Overseas Chinese team's offensive faltered, and the Southwest team repeatedly took advantage of free throws to increase their score. In this quarter, the Overseas Chinese team only scored two free throws by Shouguang and had no other gains. On the contrary, Peizhi, Qianqian, and Ruixin of the Southwest team performed well. After 22-9, the second quarter ended.</p>
<p>In the second half, both teams tried their best, but Rongtang was absent, and Shouguang lost her old partner, making it more difficult to get the ball. Therefore, although Shouguang frequently scored in this quarter, the losses in the second quarter were too great, and the score inevitably ended at 22-30.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the final quarter, the Overseas Chinese team continued to struggle. In the blink of an eye, Shouguang scored again, making the score 24-30, which was very close. In order to avoid the edge, the players of the Southwest team called a timeout. Sure enough, after this break, Tie Ji's performance was very impressive, and she seemed to be divinely assisted. Peizhi and Xiangxin also supported her from the left and right, and the score continued to increase. In this way, until the final whistle blew, the score was 36-26, and the Overseas Chinese team lost the match.</p>

<p>In the second match, which was supposed to be Mei Fang vs. Hong Kong University, Hong Kong University withdrew, and the match between Snowflake and South China team was held one hour earlier. After the opening, the South China team took advantage of Snowflake's unstable position and frequently pressured Snowflake's restricted area. Snowflake's defenders could not resist and retreated step by step. At the end of the first quarter, they were down 6-1.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Yufen performed even better, moving freely and scoring every time. On the other hand, Snowflake's Qiaobin and Manhong missed many opportunities. Therefore, at the end of the first half, they were still down 15-8.</p>
<p>In the second half, the performance of the Snowflake team gradually improved, and their morale was high. However, the South China team's defenders were very diligent and kept a close watch. On the South China team's side, although Yufen was still lively, she was constrained by Qi Huan, and there were not many contributions. At the end of this quarter, the score was 21-11, and Snowflake was down by five goals.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, the Snowflake team continued to work hard, and their morale was high. However, Yufen and Ruomei's performance was remarkable tonight, and they frequently scored points. The Snowflake sisters were discouraged. Until the final whistle, the score was 21-29, and Snowflake lost two points.   Under the Basket</p>

<h3>Movies and Dramas</h3>
<p>Entertainment...The Last Gangster</p>
<p>The Last Gangster</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson plays a villainous gangster. His success in his past works proves that he is an outstanding talent. His superb acting skills in portraying human characters have won the unanimous praise of every audience member.</p>
<p>In this film, he once again plays a villainous gangster who commits all kinds of evil deeds, disregarding the law, and manipulating the evil forces of the entire society. He dominates the world, is arrogant and unrestrained, and is invincible. But in the end, for the sake of his virtuous wife and beloved son, he sacrifices everything, including his own life, and meets a tragic end.</p>
<p>Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of great talent and have an extraordinary moving power. James Stewart and Rose Stradner co-star. At the same time, in this film, we also see Hollywood's most perfect cast of gangster actors. All the tense and moving details in this "Social Thug" will give the audience a large amount and strong new stimulation.</p>
<p>Queen...Blood on the Fishing Boat</p>
<p>Spawn of the North</p>
<p>A film adapted from a famous literary work, depicting the life of fishermen on the Alaskan Peninsula on the northern border of the United States, on the Arctic Ocean. The island is a major producer of salmon, but the fishermen who make a living by fishing must make great efforts to overcome all the difficulties that nature presents to mankind, such as icebergs floating on the sea and the rampant fishing pirates, in order to protect their interests. Their lives, filled with joy, sorrow, love, and hate, contain many touching stories.</p>
<p>The cinematography of this film is lively and ingenious. There are also several scenes of Indian sacrificial ceremonies, which, in our view, are full of mystery. At the same time, this film has five superstars. The arrangement of the plot allows everyone to have the opportunity to give full play to their artistic talents. Director Henry Hathaway has directed films such as "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" and "The Real Glory." He has a great ability to manipulate the emotions of the audience in the handling of the plot and climax of this film.</p>
<p>Peace...Brotherly Hero Breaks the Bandit Case</p>
<p>North of the Rio Grande</p>
<p>This is William Boyd's work after "Hopalong Cassidy Returns." It also depicts the story of the Western hero Hopalong Cassidy. This time, because his brother was shot and killed by robbers and was not able to get justice in court, Cassidy seeks revenge. He disguises himself as a gambler, mixes in with various dens, and secretly investigates the real murderer. After many obstacles, he finally avenges his brother and eliminates a major scourge for the West. The plot is quite tortuous. William Boyd also gives an even more wonderful performance in this film than in the previous film.</p>
<p>East East...Three Stooges at the Races</p>
<p>A Day at the Races</p>
<p>A musical comedy by the Marx Brothers and Allan Jones, filled with plenty of laughs. The female lead is Maureen O'Sullivan.</p>
<p>Dahua...Midnight Sonata</p>
<p>Moonlight Sonata</p>
<p>This is a musical love film. It is worth noting that it features the renowned pianist Paderewski. The entire structure of the film is centered around Paderewski's piano performance as the story's core. In the concert, his superb art moves the entire audience, especially a young couple. At the request of the audience, he plays "Moonlight Sonata" again, and then he narrates how a young couple was moved by the song "Moonlight Sonata" when their love broke down and reconciled as before. This is the story of the film.</p>
<p>In addition to Paderewski's art, which is worth appreciating, the plot and pacing are slightly dull. There is more dialogue than action, which is typical of British films. Charles Farrell has lost his former elegant charm.</p>
<p>Jingxing...Western Front Spy Network</p>
<p>Lancer Spy</p>
<p>A typical spy film, the entire film lacks tension and is dull. Except for a few scenes in the second half where the British spy steals military information and tries to escape, it is still quite vivid. The performances of the two leads are also average.</p>

<h3>World Peace Entertainment Picture</h3>
<p>— Ziyou</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I squeezed into the crowd to see the painting hanging on the arcade. At first, I thought it was something like "Sleeping Beauty in Spring" or "Air Raid Knowledge," but no, it was "World Peace Entertainment Picture"! We have indeed progressed compared to before, already moving from personal enjoyment to paying attention to national security, and further thinking about world peace. Yes, living in such an era, in such a place, it's really hard to stand firm without making some progress (or at least pretending to).</p>
<p>Enough small talk, let me introduce the "World Peace Entertainment Picture" to everyone: This is probably some Palace of Peace, with national flags hanging at the entrance. Wang Chonghui, Chamberlain (probably a mistake for Halifax?), Litvinov, and Ugaki (now it should be Arita, right?) are playing mahjong in the hall. Chairman Lin and Commissioner Chiang are behind Foreign Minister Wang. Roosevelt is between Foreign Minister Wang and Chamberlain. Daladier is beside Litvinov. Mussolini and Hitler are standing beside Ugaki watching the game. This mahjong game is really intense, everyone stands to win big; however, Chamberlain's pair of South is directly opposite Ugaki's pair of South, Litvinov's White Board is also opposite Ugaki's, but our Foreign Minister Wang wins "Full Lake" and achieves "Final Victory." In addition, Zia, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, and Franco's gang are in the corner of the hall; while Garen, Lytton, and Beneš are under another picture in the hall. This is the full picture of the entertainment of world peace.</p>
<p>After all, Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China is China, the front line and the rear are clearly divided; it's not like in Chongqing on the front line where people are already dancing, let alone Hong Kong which is more comfortable and safer than the rear. Anyway, there is plenty of money and time, so of course we have to find some entertainment to pass the days. Aren't the theaters and dance halls all packed? I heard that some people even feel lonely in the "night life" and want to design the largest-scale "nightclub" in the Far East. The size of Hong Kong, of course, can accommodate a "World Peace Entertainment Picture" painted for entertainment.</p>
<p>But treating world peace as entertainment is a bit embarrassing for our Mr. Chamberlain. It also makes the positive significance of world peace, which is to seek permanent happiness for mankind, too burlesque; and it views the Chinese nation's fight for its own independence, freedom, happiness, and the world's permanent peace as a desperate gamble of national fortunes. That's a bit unreasonable.</p>
<p>The cleaning-up movement in the film industry has been repeatedly proposed, and the purification movement in the press is also being intensified these days, but we must also clean up street paintings and all things containing toxins that are very close to the public. Especially the comic strips that children love to read.</p>
<p>Since the poisonous "World Peace Entertainment Picture" can be hung on the street and attract many viewers, why can't we paint an accurate and positive "World Peace Picture"? This is also a task that we cannot relax.</p>
<h3>Homesickness</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>The wild grape trellis outside the window has completely shed its youthful decorations, and the lush green palm leaves hidden at the foot of the wall have turned withered and yellow. Although it is the season on the South Sea, the melancholy tones of autumn have clearly painted everything on the island.</p>
<p>My hometown is probably already deep in autumn.</p>
<p>Time always flies like an arrow. It has been exactly seven years since I left my northeastern hometown. Thinking back to the early spring of last year, in the quiet ancient city, I received a letter from my distant hometown. My father still diligently said, "You have been away from home for six years; we feel the oppression of the ×× country increasing day by day here, and I'm afraid we won't have a chance to meet." I know that my old mother, who leans on the door every day waiting for my return, and my father, have spent so much thought for their son who they can't see again in the second half of their lives, wanting to see him once. In fact, the mountains and rivers have not blocked us, and the distant roads have not cut off the exchange of our thoughts, but the poisonous evil forces and the hands stained with blood have blocked all communication. "Don't come back, we are at ease with you." Such words were also written in my father's letter: "Although we can't touch you with our hands or press our foreheads close to you, but—we are at ease." Below this line of words, there were traces of tears, and the most smudged part was under the line: "We want you to believe that we are all safe and happy." Oh, I know this. Based on my dry imagination, my hometown is probably a completely different scene.</p>
<p>My simple and lovely hometown, how can I erase you from my heart and memory? I recall the past, when I spent a wonderful and sweet childhood on the Liao River, grew into a strong youth on the Hun River, listened to the enemy playing military horns at the Japanese station at dusk in Liaoyang, spent my student days, and wasted seven years in the desolate borderlands. The footprints of the past have become the creative source of constant pain in my heart. If the past was happy, then today's memories really have no taste of bitter and sour words, and the sourness and bitterness of this longing cannot be compared to anything.</p>
<p>It was the summer of seven years ago when my father saw me off at the Shenyang train station. Before arriving at the station, he earnestly advised me with great fortitude:</p>
<p>"Go, there is nothing to worry about?"</p>
<p>That was under the shade of the fence in the garden, we were sitting side by side on the moist and fresh soil. The tranquil scenery of the northeast made us miss the good times of abundant resources and rich people in the earlier days even more. We were surrounded by the sounds of cicadas, and from a distance, there was the clear singing of water being drawn in the vegetable garden.</p>
<p>My father said: "You can go with peace of mind. I have prayed several times. God will surely protect you." After he finished speaking, he led me to kneel down and pray.</p>
<p>But at the station, on the crowded platform with bustling pedestrians, his eyes were wet, he said:</p>
<p>"Really, it doesn't matter whether you go or not, this year."</p>
<p>I saw that his heart had become soft.</p>
<p>The train had already started slowly, but he still chased after a few steps, waving his hand and saying:</p>
<p>"Remember to write letters, remember."</p>
<p>The beacon fire of not being slaves has lengthened the distance between us again. The most heartbreaking thing is that before the sound of gunfire at Lugou Bridge, he left the enslaved territory, and his heart, which had suffered oppression and trauma all his life, flew to another free land. Now, although our hometown and garden are far away from us, on the other hand, we are getting closer and closer to our northeastern hometown.</p>
<p>Here, I rarely meet acquaintances from my hometown, and I can no longer hear the local dialect spoken in my hometown. I can only use this autumn scenery to possibly recall the past scenes of my hometown.</p>
<p>The vast and flat northeastern wilderness, let me unfold your appearance in my memory, let me smell the fragrance of new grains and the fragrance of licorice, and step on the soil in my imagination to visit freely.</p>
<h3>A Sweet Kiss</h3>
<p>— Dongjiang</p>
<p>Let me embrace you and kiss your face,</p>
<p>I hope you will never have any more worries in your life.</p>
<p>Look down with your keen eyes;</p>
<p>Gather the will of a lone eagle,</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of the thorns, the overlapping mountain passes;</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of the × people's anti-aircraft guns and barbarism.</p>
<p>My love! My heart!</p>
<p>I am very excited to leave you.</p>
<p>But when all our people have not yet gained freedom,</p>
<p>I hope you will be under the wings,</p>
<p>Always making the × people shed fresh blood!</p>
<p>May you forget everything,</p>
<p>Fly away in your plane!</p>
<p>I will comfort your elderly mother;</p>
<p>Care for your young children:</p>
<p>And watch over your fields and gardens...</p>
<p>Go! Go!</p>
<p>May you forget everything.</p>
<h3>Growing Up Under Bombardment, Growing Stronger in the Fire</h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>The Changsha Children's Theater Troupe in Hengyang</p>
<p>On April 10th, enemy bombs blossomed in Changsha; Hunan University and most of the streets were destroyed, but a bright fruit was born - the Changsha Children's Theater Troupe held its inaugural meeting at this time.</p>
<p>Their establishment was inspired by the work of the Children's Drama Troupe and the New An Travel Troupe; "The children in the war zone are all organized, and the children in our rear really shouldn't be inactive," their troupe leader Miss He Li told me; "So, Tian Hainan - do you know Tian Hainan? Mr. Tian Han's son - and I, a few people, launched the organization of children's groups..." The hardships experienced during this process are naturally the same as the growth of other groups. But with the great help of the children's efforts, they were finally born in the smoke and flames.</p>
<p>"We are children from a few years old to more than ten years old... In our young age, the Japanese invaders' war of aggression has been imposed on our heads... We have lost our homes, lost our parents, broken up our brothers and sisters; some have lost their lives, some have become disabled, some have become refugees with their parents, and some have been occupied by ×; the rest who have not been killed may be bombed by × people at any time. ...To stop the ferocity of the × people, we can only fight against the whole country, regardless of north or south, young or old. Although we are young, we have patriotic enthusiasm and the ambition to save the country. As long as we unite, we will generate a powerful force... So we organize this theater troupe, ready to use our innocence and enthusiasm to inspire our parents, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters through drama to have patriotic emotions and jointly fight against the war and build the country..." This moving declaration, with the development of their work, is generally spread before people's eyes; in another document, they wrote: "To accept practical education through practical work, improve life, train ourselves, and educate ourselves." This fully expresses their correctness.</p>
<p>Soon after its establishment, they carried out an unprecedented work: that is, on July 12th, a joint performance with the Changsha Children's Wartime Service Corps to donate to orphans. The income of one thousand five hundred yuan was donated to the Hunan Children's Welfare Association. The performance was completely initiated by the children, and was performed in the form of a joint music and drama troupe, and received huge sums of money, as the reporter of the Anti-Japanese War Daily said: "This is an initiative due to the innocence of the children, without "divergent political views," and only knowing to work hard."</p>
<p>In addition, they broadcast a play or song every week. Almost all of the broadcast scripts were written by themselves, with a total of five.</p>
<p>This was only three months ago.</p>
<p>"Later, because Tian Hainan went to Xichuan, some of the children left Changsha with their families, or went to the countryside with their schools, and at the same time," He Tuanzhang said, emphasizing her tone, "at the same time, our troupe site was also cruelly bombed, and all the equipment we had earned with hard work was completely destroyed. I also went to Luoyang to serve, and in this way, the Children's Theater Troupe was in a state of death in an intangible way; however, this death was only a stop in work. Everyone still hopes for its resurrection and is working hard to make it resurrect... Otherwise, why is there today?"</p>
<p>The two ends of the Yuehan Road were lost, but Changsha, the heart of the Yuehan Road, suddenly changed its face, became volatile and tense, and people also had a new understanding. If they didn't work hard anymore, the devil's hand could immediately reach the heart. So the mainstays of the Children's Theater Troupe began new activities, and He Li also returned from Luoyang. Under the efforts of the children and with the assistance of adults, it was restored, and the members were screened, and the organization also had changes that were more suitable for work, because they were prepared to work everywhere like the Children's Theater Troupe and the New An Travel Troupe in case of emergency. But without sources of funds, work could not be carried out:</p>
<p>While dealing with the relations of the Political Department of the Military Commission, the tragedy of the Changsha fire began to unfold. The millions they had prepared arrived in an instant, and the gentlemen of the Political Department asked us to take their retreating military vehicles to Hengyang, and promised to temporarily give us a subsidy of two hundred yuan per month to see the future work and then decide our fate. Miss He talked eloquently, with her words expressing her meaning well.</p>
<p>In terms of life, without Miss He talking about it, I already knew it very clearly. The first day gave me the impression that "the next generation is stronger than us." They would get up at five o'clock—when it was not yet bright—after the officer on duty blew the whistle. After getting up, they would immediately tidy up their beds and start the morning meeting. "Chairman, I have a point."</p>
<p>"Chairman, what he said is wrong, it should be..."</p>
<p>"We should save money on eating and use more money on work." It was really unbelievable that these words were spoken by children in their teens. After the morning meeting, they would practice their voices, sing, ...and then wash their faces. Everyone used cold water to wash their faces, and several people shared a bottle of toothpaste. After the meal, they would set out in a team to work; writing slogans, selling tickets (for the collection of cotton-padded quilt bonds)... Collective life, collective learning, collective work. In the collective, they forged a group of warriors.</p>
<p>"Don't think that children are easy to manage," Miss He continued. "They are indeed good at being pure, but under the past society and education in China, they have also developed some bad habits, such as showing off. They also have this. If you let them develop too freely or praise them too much, they will become arrogant..."</p>
<p>"Managing is not suppressing, and indulgence is not development," the reporter interjected.</p>
<p>Miss He continued: "What I feel most difficult now is that I have no help. I have to do everything myself. I hope that before the new cadres appear, you can always help me, constantly instill their political understanding and teach them some work skills..."</p>
<p>I have talked to more than a dozen children individually. Everyone has almost the same understanding, and everyone has their own strengths. One fourteen-year-old friend writes well, one can draw cartoons, one is especially learning the conducting method of the famous musician Sun Shen... In particular, there is a child whose family has called him back three times. His father and grandmother always called him, but he politely refused. He said that if he was called back, it would be nothing more than studying, living a comfortable life. In fact, aren't we studying in the group? And what we are studying are practical books, and we live a happier life than at home. I won't do anything for you even if I am filial to you, but isn't it more important to save the country? If the country is strong, won't it repay your kindness in raising your son? You are all older than me, don't you understand? The family had no choice but to lie to him: go home, and come back again. But when he got to the door of his house, he immediately ran back to the group. When I think of this, it makes me more determined to make the children's theater troupe sound." Miss He said excitedly.</p>
<p>Now, the Children's Theater Troupe, by order of the Political Department, has gone to Guilin. I heard that they are going to merge them with the Children's Drama Troupe. Miss He said to me that her friends didn't really agree with the merger. Because the reason for the merger is that there are too few people, which is not enough. If there is more funding, I will naturally expand the work capacity even more. Now we have decided: (1) If we incorporate the Children's Drama Troupe into the first team, and we are the second team, it is okay. Otherwise, (2) please give us a subsidy. (3) If neither is possible, we will still resume our previous working method: to fight for survival through work... We have already written a letter to Director Tian Han about this.</p>
<p>Unification is necessary, but it is not appropriate to eliminate others through unification. This is the conclusion.</p>
<p>They left yesterday. All walks of life in Hengyang gave them a lot of help and gave them infinite sympathy in the meeting to collect cotton-padded quilts. May they become stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Written in Hengyang on December 27, 1938</p>
<h3>Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>And in the hearts of the officers, seeing the number of sick people increase, they were shaking their heads secretly every day. When several officers got together, this sentence would definitely be said unconsciously:</p>
<p>"It's really bad, it's back to the situation in Jiangxi."</p>
<p>In Jiangxi, that was something from the past. At that time, it was "National Movement," and one-third of the brothers in a division were sick.</p>
<p>Now, I heard that the team was going to set off. Some brothers knew that they were going back to their hometown in Henan, and everyone was ecstatic, and even the sick people's illnesses improved by seventy or eighty percent because of this.</p>
<p>Whether it was the directly affiliated troops of the division headquarters or the brigade, regiment, battalion, and company, everyone was packing their luggage and preparing to set off. The second day arrived, and it was time to set off. Our landlord—the old man in his seventies, who spent his time raising chickens and ducks to pass the time, waved a white goose feather fan that he never left his hand, hitting his thin and bare back, and asked us with concern:</p>
<p>"Comrades, are you going to set off?"</p>
<p>"Yes." (To be continued)</p>
