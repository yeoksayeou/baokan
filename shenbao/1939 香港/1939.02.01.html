<h3 id="c1">五中全會的議案 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國民黨五中全會是在第二期全面抗戰開始的時候召集的，抗戰第二期是轉敗為勝，轉弱為強的階段，具有在第一期基礎上完成全部抗戰建國事業的意義，所以領導抗戰的國民黨此次的最高會議，當然帶着非常重要的使命，全國人民也皆引頸期待着决議案的公佈。這次會議的經過及議决案，雖然直至今日始全部公佈，但是此次的收獲却相當重大。僅就集會的情形言，這次集會的人數卽比前三次尤多；討論時日雖只有一個星期，但其决議案却相當具體而切合目前的需要。茲就其成就，略抒所見：據各報所發表的决議要案，共有十六件，普及於黨政軍及經濟建設各方面。關於黨政的决議案，最主要的約有三點：（一）着重於下級黨政機構改進辦法的實施，（二）改進黨的工作方法，（三）黨政軍各級人員子弟之服務乓役應以身作法。這是非常重要的決議，我們如果本諸「病不忌醫」的精神來講，則抗戰十八個月的經騐，確使我們覺得下級黨政機構太不健全，工作人員也太腐敗，並且在抗戰的過程中中，上層黨政機構皆在隨時改進中而下級黨政機構的改革卻非常落後；因此黨的工作效率也就受到極大的影響。再加以黨政各級人員有規避責任不能為一般民衆的表率者，其阻碍抗戰工作之進展更大。</p>
<p>關於軍事方面的决議案，當以設置國防最高委員會為最緊要。据日前本報重慶專電，這次設置的國防最高委員會，比較現有的國防會議，組織更為充實，委員長决定由蔣委座自兼，而其他六個委員則由黨政領袖及深有資望的「在野名流」各二人充任，在這裏我們可指出兩點的進歩：（一）國防最高會議的組織份子，已不復獨限於軍事人材，而黨政領袖也皆參預，此後的國防會議的討論及決議，當埂　能適應黨政軍各方面互相配合的客觀需求；（一）此後的最高國防會議已不獨為上層領導抗戰的組織，加上在野名流於其組織中，一方面可以表示我們的政治機構隨抗戰之需要而日益民主化，另一方面抗戰的最高領導機關，也可以因為在野名流之參加而得洞悉民情，適應民衆的要求，以增強抗戰力量。因此，這兩個在野名流的人選問題，關係非常重大，其主要的條件，就是眞正洞悉民情，能够代表人民的意志。雖其人選似已內定，但其關係重大，故不憚煩，在這裏提醒當局的注意。其次，改善徵兵辦法，也是非常重要的决議，我們常聽到各地方許多徵兵舞弊的黑慕，其弊害甚至影嚮人民厭畏戰爭，在抗戰第二期軍事着重於「建軍」的今日，微兵辦法之改善口，是急不容緩的問題。</p>
<p>其餘的决議案，自大體上說，都是關於經濟建設的辦法，其要點不外乎改善戰時財政金融的許劃，推進西部各省的生產建設與統制，改善對外貿易，加緊推進合作事業諸端。就中首推戰時財政金融的改善為最重要，不特可以增加軍政等方面浩大費用的來源，並且可以安定戰時產業及社會經濟，如調劑地方金融卽其一例。又如獎勵調換現金白銀與加強產金工作及效率，也不失為改善戰時財政的一要案。其次，改善生產與貿易也為要策，因為戰爭是種極大的耗費，為着塡補這種消耗，只有兩種積極的方法：其一是增加國內生產，其二是增進國際收入。這次决議案中，關於這兩部分的規定相當具體，在生產方面着重於西部的建設與統制，其具體辦法則為提倡並獎勵手工業，加緊推進合作事業；在對外貿易方面着重於獎勵出口及改善外滙兩點。這些决案當然都是經濟建設的基本要案，不過我們還希望當局能根據這些基本决議案再做到三點，就是安定法幣，疏通金融，便利民運。</p>
<p>除决議案而外，本屆會議還有兩種大的收獲，就是委員長的致詞所指示的抗戰理念與具體辦法，及全會宣言中所指示的推行抗戰方策的三種原則：卽加強團結，積極奮鬥，加緊建設。關於委員長之指示，已於日前著文申論過，現再就後者的三種原則略為一說。我們的抗戰是全面抗戰的偉大工作，所以必須「舉國一致，上下一心」，纔可以排除萬難而底於成功。但是團結貴乎眞誠，所以各黨各派須具「共信互信」的精神切實合作。其次，我們的抗戰為爭最後勝利，而此種抗戰又為最艱苦的事實，故有中途畏難停止的危險，所謂「行百里者半九十」，卽指此而言。我們現在的成功只欠一簣，我們能再進十里，則最後目的可達，否則前功盡廢，所以全國上下必須忍苦渡過最後這一關頭。再次，關於加緊建設之點，是抗戰具體辦法的要着，我們已屢次論及經濟建設，但建設不獨限於經濟，此外精神建設及政治建設，尤為重要。我們須發揮總理軍人精神的教育，使　萬萬五千萬人民皆抱「不成功卽成仁」的精神；我們還須「嚴明賞罰，綜　名實，集中力量，增進效率」，特別是「加強民衆組織，統一民衆行動，解除人民痛苦，改善人民生活」，以貫澈政治建設。</p>
<p>總之，五中全會這次的决議案是切實而具體，切望中央及地方各級政府，能根據這個决議案切實施行並加推進。</p>
<p>更正：二十八日的社評中有三點排錯的地方，特為校正如下：下段十一行「一計劃經濟的基本精神在於三民主義集權制」應為「……民主集權制」，下段三十行。「特別提出的紀律問題一，應為「……黨的紀律問題」。下段三十二行「國民黨是抗戰的黨」應為「國民黨是領導抗戰的黨」。</p>

<p>— 王坪</p>
<p>「傷兵之友」運動</p>
<p>衡陽位處粵漢要點，是負傷戰士集聚地之一，當地人士，除了為他們徵集幾次棉衣棉被及經常慰勞外，並由某外籍朋友聯合當地知名之士，組織了個「傷兵之友」運動，並且準備把運動擴到全國去。</p>
<p>「傷兵之友」的意義，根据這名字就可以明白完，全是為了替傷兵服務而組織的。他們會在衡陽發動替傷兵洗衣，替傷兵剃頭的兩個運動，成續都相當的好，只可惜組織不大健全，缺乏專門負責的人，更缺乏廣泛的爭取史多的人更多的團體參加，至今似乎已經「待斃」了。</p>
<p>抗戰工作座談會建立了</p>
<p>据說，衡陽是湖南最複雜的地方，封建勢力的厚濃是旁的地方所不及的，根据記者多久的觀察。也確是如此：新舊勢力之爭，新舊勢力內部的矛盾，從各方面都可看得出來。</p>
<p>因此，在抗戰工作上，也是各自為政，漠不相干的——甚至還互相毀謗，這對工作上，實在是一個莫大的損失，幾次教訓後，大家都覺得應該馬上克服，要不然，×人的魔手，會很快伸到這古老的城池：但互相間俱不好提出，結果由新創的「新階段」旬刊社，與外來團體軍委會政治部抗×演劇隊第八隊，在歡迎貴州戰地工作團的會議上，提出這個要求，立刻得到完滿的反應，當場由每團體推出代表一人組織一「抗戰工作座談曾」，所有在衡陽的工作團體文化機構均是成員，每禮拜座談一次，由各團體輪流召集，座談題目，由前次會議說定並得由召集人的增刪，第一座談。已經舉行過了，討論的題目是怎樣開展衡陽的工作及反汪運動的加强。</p>
<p>慢慢的衡陽將在抗戰中站起來，站得更高，出力更大。</p>
<p>最後，此地新出版一「新階段」句刊，負責人為名木刻家溫濤及向愚，這完全是一民衆刊物，第一期的內容有轉載的蔣委員長訓話全文，周恩來的論最近戰局，此外是一個反汪特輯及葉劍英先生特為該刊寫的「新階段中的戰局」……等等，銷路相當的好，當有可能成為西南文化支柱之一。</p>

<p>【上海通訊】浙東之溫州寗波、為戰後唯一之通航口岸、內地土貨之輪出、以及洋貨之輸入、均由被兩口岸轉口，浙江省政府籌設專營局統制貨運，發展運輸之效能、同時與贛閩湘各省舉辦水陸聯運、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>甬甌兩關　貨物激增　戰後之溫州、寗波兩口岸、因貨運出入激增、原有海關增派關員服務、稅收隨之增加如去年溫州關進口貨值國幣一百九十二萬三千元、出口貨值國幣六百二十四萬元、寗波關進口貨值國幣一百二十一萬二千元、出口貨值國幣四百七十六萬八千元、出口貨之增加、創該兩關之新紀錄、前年甯波關出口、僅二萬六千元、溫州關出口、僅五十四萬一千元、</p>
<p>籌設專局　統制貨運　浙江省府鑒於溫州及甯波、已成為內地各省貨物出入口重要口岸、以致船舶數量有限、遂呈供不應求之象、船戶任意抬價、商民殊感痛苦、今為調節社會經濟、疏通貨運計、已由財政計廳劃籌設專營局、統制甬甌兩江之貨運並可增加省庫收入、發展運輸之效能、</p>
<p>水陸聯運　業已實行　浙團贛湘桂等省、業已實行水陸聯運、以上各省公路業巳互通、浙贛鐵路已與粵漢鐵路接通、湘桂鐵路第一段已完成通車、所以各省主要土貨之輸港或滬、及洋貨必需品之輸入、均由寧波溫州兩口岸轉運、第十集團軍總司令部巳核准各外輪、行駛甬溫港、及甬溫滬各航綫、旨在促進內地土貨裝外輪輸出、</p>

<p>【路透社柏林一月卅一日電】各方佇候已久之希特勒對國會演說、卒於昨晚在「克羅爾戲院」發表、當時戲院座位皆滿、蓋不僅國會議員全體出席、卽外交團人員亦皆蒞臨也，統觀整篇演詞中、並無一驚人之點、且亦並未暗示將來國社黨之行動、演詞中之要點、大概為（一）再行提出殖民地之要求、（二）重新聲明德國將於戰時為意大利之臂助、（三）西方各國如妄欲干涉德國內政、德國决難容忍之、此外希特勒又猛烈攻擊猶太人、其言略謂、「如國際猶太人金融家、再欲掀起另一大戰、則結果必非為德國之破壞、而為全歐洲猶太人民族之消滅」、希特勒發言之初、先向「大德意志」國會議員八十五人重述六年以前一月三十日國社黨開始當政時之情形、「當時約有一萬三千萬之男女國民投票、擁護余所領導之國社黨、尚有二千萬投票者、則零星分配於其他各小黨派、各該小黨派之數、約有十五、其所以能團結一致者、厥因對於國社黨運動、抱有共同之仇恨、彼等與國社黨作長期鬥爭、競取領導地位、又與猶太人沆瀣一氣、以期保全其利益、在各教會中、帶有政治臭味之主教、復為若輩祝福、當時情形如此、祗有最後一剎那間之「奇蹟」始能挽救德國之生命、吾人確信有此「奇蹟」、而吾人之敵人、則非笑之，如德國果然淪陷於布爾希維克之擾亂中、則整個的西方文明、勢將遭遇極大之危機，其範圍之深遠實不堪設想、迨莫索里尼與意大利之法西主義開始抬頭、歐洲之生機始在一方面出現、我國社黨人得勢後、又將此運動推展全另一方面、吾人今日乃得目擊國際的猶太人之陰謀為吾人奮勇推翻、因其欲消減歐洲及其文化也、吾人經六年之時間、乃得實踐數百年來之夢想、惟無知無識者、或以為吾人未嘗經歷任何之奮鬥、不知在德國今年實行統一以前、吾人為政治理想而苦鬥者、幾有二十年之久、吾人抱有堅強之决心、出以勇敢之行動、為此理想之勝利而奮鬥」、希特勒至是又回溯一九三八年之事變。並將德奧合併及「東土」與德國之最後統一從詳說明、「凡此種種、吾人皆以不遑喘息之速度促其成功、吾人對於新德意志軍隊行軍之神速與效能、抱有信仰、此種信仰、不但未使吾人失望、且更越過吾人之預期」、希特勒述及在捷克事變時之德軍動員情形云、「吾人並未對任何人威脅、吾人僅欲從事自衛、以抵抗第三者之妄施干涉耳、不但過去如此、卽將來亦然、今後如有任何西歐國家、對于專關吾人之事件妄施干涉、使各該事件之合理的以及自然的解决、不能實現、則吾人亦　　决不容忍之、吾人之良友莫索里尼君提出建議、謂吾人應卽求出若干原則、不但使今日急須解决之問題、可以和平解决、卽其他一切重要問題、亦可籍以求得合理的處置及解决、當時吾人莫不引以為快、張伯倫君與達拉第君對於莫索里尼之建議從容接受、亦值得吾人之崇敬此種強國之團結、苟非抱有設法解决此項問顧之决心，實無法達到、吾人為求國內之團結、固無須劍拔弩張、唯有在外界恫嘛下、為謀自衛計、始須出此也、德國靑年己承受其首次試騐而光榮無愧矣」、希特勒旋進而鄭重申明、欲圖一國之強大、須國內能遵紀律、守秩序、並須有舉國一致之行動</p>
<p>德國經濟　希特勒又提及德國之經濟情形、及外國所傳德國在「信用恐慌」之危機下、行將招致經濟崩潰之說、謂「有一事為德國人民所充分明瞭者、即德國一向處於經濟上特別困難之地位、吾人之須會鬥、固無疑義、惟吾人將獲得勝利、亦無疑義、且余敢同諸君明告曰、吾人業已勝利矣、希特勒否認民主國家所傳德國對荷蘭有垂涎之意、渠稱「若干人妄謂美國、南美及荷蘭等國之政制與德國不同、故吾人卽將攻擊之、此說絕對不確、吾人殊不欲將國社主義輸出國外」、希特勒又稱、從經濟觀點言、剝奪德國之殖民地、實無謂之至、戰前、民主政治者嘗聞德國瓦解後、英國貿易將大為增加、然戰後、英國人民固未嘗較前富裕也、「德國今日之強大、實為向來所無、吾人不欲藉殖民地以為駐兵之地盤、吾人有如許人口、已甚滿足、惟吾人之需要殖民地、乃所以謀解决德國之經濟問題也、吾人需要購買食物及原料、並出售製造品、吾人出品之精良、固不下於其他國家之出品、經濟學家每謂貨幣之價值、係以金準備為基礎、此說實為可笑、而吾人以為、德國馬克之價值、須以工人之能力及其出品之質量為基礎也、欲解除德國之經濟困難、第一、應擴展其生存之空間、今則此種空間尚未能儘量供德國之利用、故德國必須增加輸出、在經濟的立塲言、交還殖民地於德國、乃比較賢明之辦法也、使七百萬失業者、獲得工作、比較增加工資、尤為重要、吾人必須輸出貨品、以便購買糧食、否則唯有饑餓而死耳、雖然、余敢為諸君確告者、德國人民則將繼積生存、其領袖且願竭心盡力、龜勉從事、再德國對于英法兩國毫無嫉恨、但願與彼等和平相處耳、吾人己藉德國報紙為喉舌、而答覆一切借戰爭而牟利之徒、並告德國人日、德國平均每公哩之人口、約為一百三十五人、實無餘地以容納猶太人矣、其他國家較有容納之餘地、然彼等復謂無法收容、倘國際金融猶太集團冉行發動戰爭、則其結果、將非德國之破壞、而為全歐猶太人之消滅矣」、</p>
<p>裁軍問題　希特勒述及政教關係云、「如教會對於現狀感覺不滿意、德國己準備隨時效法美兩國之故事、而使政教分離」、希特勒對于裁軍問題發表意見云、「各國如先由經濟的立場、與德國商妥政治問題及殖民地問題、自比較糜費巨量金錢於軍火商、使人民加重負担之為妥善也、反之、如各國政治家、欲以經濟制裁手段、向吾人威脅、余敢確切相告、此事果至實現，則勢將發動一經濟的惡戰、而在此惡戰中、吾人比絞其他「生產力平巳超過飽和點」之國家、實易于應付也、再如意大利、一旦捲入戰爭、德國必絕對的援助意大利、法西主義之意大利、與國社主義之德意志、行將保證歐洲文化之安全矣、德國之所援助西班牙國民軍者、因德國不欲西班牙之布爾希維克化、國民軍將拯救西班牙人民、而殲滅「政治上的傳教士」、或西班牙人民之公敵、「德國早會設法統一各新教教會、徒以少數主教之反抗、致告失敗、余覺世界將有長時期之和平、僅造謠者以為戰爭將至耳、德國對於英法並無領土之要求、有之、惟殖民地耳、彼等如以為殖民地並無價值可言、則請其歸還於德國、當不致使其不快也、似若有人妄稱、德國無管理殖民地之能力、則甚可笑矣、吾人試就一切反對派之論調觀之、便知今日之問題、乃一實力問題、而並非一公道或情理的問題也、一國如無相當之空間、及若干必需的原料、則欲維持其經濟的生存、殊不可能、吾人對於北美之關係旣為無稽的謠言所中傷矣、吾人必不准美國干涉吾人之內政、德國與波蘭、匈牙利及甫斯拉夫、悉為隣友、而對巴爾幹之貿易關係、亦皆良好、吾人希望捷克內部能加以整頓、而不致冉度採取其前德總統貝奈斯氏之危險政策」、</p>
<p>德日關係　希特勒對於德日關係發表意見云、「今日此界受布爾希維克之威脅、而盲自前進、吾人之對日關係、實因事前確認有竭全力以阻止布黨潮流之需要、而後加以决定者也、余覺反共協定將來或為若干國家之結晶品、因各該國家之最後目的、無非在消滅布黨惡魔、對于世界和平與文化之威脅耳、日本在過去一年來、已表現不少之英勇榜樣（？）彼實在世界之另一方面為文化而戰鬥也（？）故日本之崩潰，對於歐洲或世界其他部份之文明國家皆無利益、而僅將造成布爾希維克主義在遠東之勝利耳（？）希特勒演說共達二小時之久、詞畢、戈林向之道謝其過去六年來之功績、最後乃高呼「勝利萬歲」、至是各議員全體歡唱德國國歌及域社黨黨歌、官方宣布希特勒之演詞、將另以英、法、意三國言語、作一簡單的廣播、</p>
<p>【海通社柏林一月卅日電】希特勒于國社黨秉政六週年紀念之演說詞、各方期待己久、將於本晚八時發表、據可靠方面稱、希特勒此次演說、將為其生平所作之最長者、消息靈通方面稱、其演詞幾達打字紙二百首、雖行間甚疏，然亦非兩小時以上不能講完、該演詞實至為重要、聞希特勒復最後加以修改、以便加入最近消息云、</p>

<p>英帝航機德里阿號昨（卅一日）由港飛越，經過潿洲島西上空，突遭日本戰艦開砲猛轟，詳情具見今日本報港聞版。這事值得我們加以嚴重注視，並喚起友邦各界迅作嚴正表示。</p>
<p>第一，我們要明白日本侵略者自從發動對華全面進攻以來，首先封鎖我國沿海，斷絕我國與各友邦海上交通；繼即企圖封鎖我國天空，斷絕我國與各友邦空中交通。×人此種非法行動雖曾托詞為戰時特殊情形，實則除軍事意義以外，重要的却是企圖遮斷各國對華貿易及破壞各國遠東權益。况且日本侵略者迄今未向我國正式宣戰，絕未取得交戰國權利，因此日本方面迭次襲擊各國商船與民航機，不斷造成恐怖事件，不僅為蔑視第三國權利，而且是向第三國的瘋狂挑釁。</p>
<p>第二，日方自發動全面進攻以來，僅以天空而論，卽曾先後襲擊中美合辦的中航公司的南京號機·浙江號機，中德合辦的歐亞公司的十五號機及英國帝航公司多拉多號機，因為當時各國止於抗議，未加實力制裁，使日方日益大胆猖狂。現在英美各友邦若容忍日方此種××挑釁××破壤，而不思密切聯合共同切實對付，則恐怖不幸事件，必將變本加厲層出不窮。</p>
<p>最後我們更須特別指出，日本侵略者一日未退出中國，則英美法各友邦在遠東的權益卽一日無保障；因此各友邦人士應加緊推動各國政府迅取積極援華制日行動。譬如為答復日方濫襲航機的暴行，即可加緊以飛機及技術人才援助我國，增強我國空軍力量，俾能保衛天空的安全。</p>
<h3 id="c23">希特勒的狂言 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>柏林卅一日電稱，希特勒於卅晚在國會發表其「為世界焦切待望」之演說詞。聲明法西斯德國目前態度即（一）要求殖民地；（二）如意國參戰，德絕對助意：（三）對日本侵華，决全力支持。由此可知那些「焦切待望」者所得到的，不是和平，而是更大的戰爭的嚇詐！</p>
<p>希特勒要求的第一點，所謂收囘殖民地，事實上却是要求擴大戰爭軍新分割世界。因為誰都知道德國舊有殖民地，多係貧疾之區，絕對不能「救濟德國的經濟」亦無從供給「德人需要的糧食與原料」。希特勒所謂「收囘殖民地可以給予七百萬失業工人以工作」，純為欺騙人民之談。如果一考希特勒執政六年以來的「治績」，一看德國今日經濟危機嚴重人民生活貧困的情形，則更可明瞭德國內部最近反希特動運動激漲的良非偶然。希特勒現在不以奧大利捷克之掠獲為足，而仍以收回殖民地口號，加緊擴大對外戰事，正是轉移內部危機向英法各國爭奪領土主權的表現</p>
<p>希特勒演詞中特別強調德國决心援助意大利侵略者作戰及為日本法西斯軍閥侵華強詡辯護，更足証國際法西斯侵略陣綫與民主各國和平陣綫嚴重對立的事實。現在我國尚有少數人士，堅執似是而非的浮面的利害論，否認眞正由於利害而結合的侵略陣綫與和平陣綫嚴重對立的事實。例如昨日各報刊登德國侵略者所發消息，竟有人發為德蘇兩國接近及德意行將不顧日本之論，表面上雖可使人一快，而實際上此種論調，等於夢囈。觀於希特勒演制之袒助日意，卽可明瞭。我們觀察事實，必須拚除感情與幻想，我們不怕面對醜惡的現實，不僅不加掩飾，而且要促人特別警惕。</p>
<p>法西斯侵略者已在英法當局妥協政策下日益壯大了，但是他們不正常的發展同時增加他們內部的危機，因此他們更將瘋狂發動對外冒險，而且他們——德日意間的勾結，亦必更加緊密，他們還在狂言恫嚇，造語離間和平各國，及議誣蘇聯，我們必須發展和平陣綫，予以嚴重打擊，我們更須帮助侵略者內部的人民陣綫潑展，共同推毀法西斯侵略者的營壘。</p>

<p>— 惻隱</p>
<p>窮苦無告的同胞。最易得到人們的同情，古語有云：「惻隱之心，人皆有之』，香港各界人士的同情心是很濃厚的，從賑災工作救戰區難民工作中都充分的表現出來！</p>
<p>手車夫，窮苦，告的一羣，生活是很艱困的倘若直接向手車公司租軍來拉，每　車租六毫，每—雜用數元，負担還比較少一點。至於那些由批頭發給的車，又多了一重　接的剝削，要先交給批頭茶資廿四元…車兩人同拉，批頭每車白得四十八元……按櫃廿二元，每日軍租六毫至六毫半，可以在手車館裏暫住，如此繁重的負担，着實不易維持—在交通　達的現在，手車快的生意是很有限的，每天收入至多一元零（拉上班者收入還會少一點），除了車租及各　寗項負担之外，兩餐鄱不容易維持，有　兒的史慘了！</p>
<p>仝九龍手軍有三百五十多輛，手軍夫工人約八九百人、手車都由顏成坤、黃錫祥·顧子安，周耀庭，茂豐等五間公司發出，各公司及批頭與手車工人尚相安無事，可是×××的一個枇頭顏××就特別不同，他對手車夫工人的剝削特別利害，而且不斷的施以無理壓迫，顏××向×××公司批來十五架手軍，每天向公司納租每車五毫，可是向手車　收租八毫（比各公司及批頭多收二毫半到三毫）·白白剝多了幾毫錢·而且又例外的收手車夫工人宿費每月二元，但實際上又幷　把地方給工人住—因為他的車館地方非常狹小，全館工人卅三，他收了宿費又將車館作生意，賣粥及凉茶等物，工人們沒有辦法，納了宿費無地住，只好另外租地方住宿，顏××又白白強瞣每人每月二元了！</p>
<p>這種無理的××，工人當然受不，生活困難使工人們不得不向顏××提出合理的要求：照普通批頭一樣，將車租減收六毫或六毫半，同時要求給地方住，可是顏××絕不理會，反不斷壓迫工人，這些手車工人迫不得己在幾日前依照法理屢次向華民交通部請求合理解决，然而到現在還沒有解决。顏××還是照樣加租，而且還誣告工人，藉口開除十幾個工人—沒收茶資及按櫃銀，將手軍租給其他車夫—這種無理的壓迫。是超出人類常情之外的—手車夫工人的生活是沒辦法解决的，這種無理的壓迫也冉不能容忍，他們决定依照法理，再向華民要求合理解决，幷函請×××同鄉會及×××先生主持公道，使這事件得早日解决，使這十幾個手車工人及其家屬不致餓斃。</p>
<p>這一批手車夫工人，這一此窮苦無告的同胞，應該得到社會各界人士的主持公道同情授助吧！</p>

<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>日間運英展覽宣揚中國歷史藝術</p>
<p>準備運往倫敦展覽的我國歷代名畫，昨天（三十日），由「香港藝術研究會」辦理，在南華西報的會議室舉行預展。</p>
<p>大的因為地方太小吧，展出的作品祇有廿七幀。量一方面雖然說得是少，但是質一方面却非常的豐富，袛有「琳　滿目，美不勝收』這一句老話，可以形容這個畫展。</p>
<p>一入門便有久已開名的，宋陳所翁所作的墨水晝「入雲龍」一大幀，撥墨作雲，變幻迫眞，極為可愛。「見首不見尾」的墨水龍也很靈活，的是一幀無懈可擊的傑構。</p>
<p>隋展子度的讀，耕·樵，釣四大幅人物素描，用筆老到，線條蒼勁，「秋山採樵」和「立釣」兩，更加可愛。</p>
<p>正中有唐李思訓作的碧綠樓閣山水「大同殿」一，畫面特別大，雕樑盡楝，曲攔小榭，大殿高閣，精細面不呆板，作者魄力眞是不小。</p>
<p>李氏還有一幀「秋山行旅圖」，也是碧綠山水，畫面寫馬三十多匹，人二十多個，每一匹馬，每一個人，都有个同的姿態—崎嶇的山徑上，有牽着馬走的，有飲馬的，也有騎着馬兒過小橋的山腰中，有小茶亭一間，野老山人八九個，正在喝茶，各個神氣不同，非常有趣，亭外休息着的馬兒，或臥，或立，不是「傳神之筆」不能寫出這樣好圖畫蘇漢臣——五代人——的「龍女圖」，金碧輝皇，工细富麗。</p>
<p>宋米的「雲裏帝城雙　闕，雨中春樹萬人家』山水，可說全塲生色之作，米老的山水是自成一家的，皴法，點苦，樹法……都有　特的風格，畫石更加超奇，確是「非同凡晌，唐人的山水雖然好看，但缺少宋人山水的雄渾，元人山水的淸逸。所以我說老米的山水和宋夏圭的山水，元黃公望的」富春山色』元吳鎮的「四季圖」山水，比較勝二籌。</p>
<p>宋厲歸眞的「五倫圖」，有題董鼻祖宋徽宗的御筆題字，宋徽宗是個畫人，他賞識的作品當然要比其他皇帝的御筆題畫更可貴，圖裏桐花風一雙，很工細，很靈活。</p>
<p>近人寫孔雀，工細華麗的很多，可惜十九失之板滯，這裏有唐刁光胤的花鳥圖一，寫一雙孔雀，活躍欲生，具是不可多得的作品。</p>
<p>其他作品冊頁橫披還有很多，憑着記者個人記憶，「掛一漏萬」所不免。總之從這廿多幀作品，巳經可以看出中國古代藝術的偉大。</p>
<p>藝術是打通人類同情心的利器，議我們偉大的古代藝術到外國去，使友邦人士對我們有一個更眞確的認識吧！</p>

<h3 id="c39">浙東　南田風光 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>〔浙江通訊〕這次很幸運地有機會去南田、住了三天、約略看了看各方情形、在心裏盡出南田的一個輪廓、</p>
<p>我們一向知道、南田是一方荒瘠不毛土地、單從經濟的觀點來看南田、它確是比不上浙江的任何縣份、但它也自有特殊的環境給予構成的生活上的優點、如政府人民的　常親密就是最顯著的一點、在時代的洪流中、它已跟着在進步、你看到南田人民生活中那種剛勇堅毅的風　、就會想到、這正是常日張　水先生抗淸復明的眞精神的遺留啊、</p>
<p>南田是三門灣中的一個小縣、在浙江七十五縣中是一個面積最狹人口最少的縣份、翻開一本二百八十五萬分之一的地圖來看、　所佔的地位、顯得非常渺　、實在的、南田的面積、縱續各不到三十里、全縣的人口、袛有二萬二千多人、就這二點論確乎够不上設縣的資格、所以說到南田設縣的歷史、並不很早、還是民國元年間的事情、這以前一向是象山縣轄境、雖然淸末會一度設置撫民　、那不過是一種特殊的行政組織、正式設立縣治、在民國紀元開始後才有的、因此南田島在地理上的名詞、已經開始得很早、而設縣治理、祗有二十多年的簡短歷史、</p>
<p>船隻　近三門灣快到南田的時候、就有一座氣勢雄壯的山、橫在視　之前、這山雖然並不怎麽高、但中間聳峙的那一塊岩石、顯出驚人的巍峨姿態、這就是每一個經過南田的行客所知道的大佛頭山、據當地人說、這山有七十二洞、形勢非常險要、因為這山就是明末民族英雄張蒼水先生為了抗禦淸　、圖謀恢復明室、力事整軍經武、策動抗戰的根據地、在全面抗日戰爭已達最緊張階段的現在、它是多麼令人懷戀和感奮啊、</p>
<p>鶴浦是南田縣僅有的通商碼頭、地方並不很大、約有三百住戶、是南出精華薈萃之區、從鶴浦登陸、人力車路直達縣治所在地的樊、樊是一個十足鄉村風味的地方、一共有二百多戶人家、十分之八是茅屋、這裏沒有整齊的街　、商店簡直很少、不過幾家零碎的食店、這事政府機關服務的許多人員、他們都安於鄉村工作、他們只求政治的實際效用、覺得這樣一個地域正是縣政的試騐塲所、</p>
<p>南田因為浮在大海邊、無時不受風暴的侵襲、空氣沒有一刻寧靜、嗚鳴的風掠過耳邊、像刺刀一樣銳利、如果狂　忽起、你便立脚不住、有跌仆的危險、高一點的茅屋子、就被吹場、據說一年四季、難得碰到幾天沒有風的、南田有着許多山、可都是原始狀態的岩石、沒有深厚的泥土、加以　大、樹木不能生長、木材的供給、便感困難、人民為取求的便利、當然袛有蓋茅屋居住、縣政府會經提倡普遍植桐、可是桐樹長大了、到開花結實的時候、就被大風刮去、一無留存、這種自然條件限制的嚴酷、開發的困難可想而知、</p>
<p>南田人民、大部份從事農耕、入海捕魚、却也是他們重要的副業、掙托在艱苦的生活之　、即使冒着絕大的危險、他們都認為很尋常、這造成堅強的意志、男敢的精神、淺海捕魚、通常風浪不大、很少發生危險、在深海之中、浪瀋往往把人捲去、可是他們的勇氣還是如舊、每年到了冬季、便揚帆入海、如果漁汛近，又沒有大風浪、那麼他們一定是滿載而歸、這是一宗很大的收入，在南田人民的經濟上是一個很大的帮助、</p>
<p>南田大宗的出產是蕃薯、據說年產兩百多萬担、這數自己很不少了、蕃薯不但是南田人民的主要食糧、目可供作製造品的原料、蕃薯含澱粉最富、潔白純净的「蕃著麵」、就是這種澱粉的手工精製品、記者曾到過南田許多小村落、看到每一戶人家都在忙碌地磨澱粉、製「蕃薯麵」、二十七年、「蕃　麵」的價格很好、法幣一元祇購得九斤、這鼓勵了他們加緊向外運銷、蕃　還可供作製酒精的原料、可惜那裏沒有一家酒精廠、據說曾經有人發起、終於為了集資的困難沒有成為事實、</p>
<p>因為南田人口稀少、全縣有生產力的壯丁、祇有二千三百多人、這和耕地面積數量對比、感到勞動力的不够、普通每一個農民要耕到二十畝以上、聽其荒廢的地方還很多、因之土地的價格也很便宜、除了在樊附近的田地價格比較高貴、有許多地方祗要出七八元的代價，便可購得一畝，這决非土質惡劣、而是種植事業經　者太少、自然下降的趨勞、</p>
<p>南田給我的最好印象是老百姓和政府之間的親密態度，合作精神、直如家人父子一樣、縣長之于人民、如家長之于家屬，如教師之于學生、大小公務員、沒有對民衆擺架子的惡習、他們自身看做一個老百姓、深入民衆的隊伍做工作、他們很少貼標語喊口號、可是他們的工作，確是到達了社會最下　、可以說政府和人民中間、已經沒有了什　隔膜、這到南田就首先感覺到、說到南田人民的教育程度、全縣之中、中學以上畢業的祇有一人、這可想見一般知識貧乏的程度，縣長梁翼鎬、他對于教育方面特別有興　、聽說以前教育科長一職、出他自己來兼任、他雖然感覺到經費和人力的不够、無法積極推動、然而仍竭力排除困難、尋求新的出路、現在南田全縣共有小學二十九所、學生九百二十一人、此外還有民衆學校五所、短期義務學校二所、學生各在一百六十人以上、只要這樣努力下　、將來收獲無疑是很大的、</p>
<p>壯丁訓練已開始了、一個個神情緊張的壯丁、都在「一二一」地喊着、他們不怕風、不怕凍，每個人的頭都刮得很光、脚上穿了草鞋，好像開始長途行軍的樣子、我跟社訓隊的副總隊長跑到了一個村莊、地名呌做龍泉、為的是要看看該地壯丁訓篇的成績、叫子一吹、幾十個銅筋鐵骨的教漢巳很整齊地排列在操場上、四週雖有無數的海鳥飛翔着、可是他們目不一瞬、靜靜地聽不到一點人聲、開始「齊步走」了、數十條大腿、袛有一個脚步、一憫聲音、（觀瀑一月十一日）</p>

<p>則稱苟無大北風、要一拋天（註二）方得到達、不佞因久慕衡陽景色、乃在第四天的下午、船抵朱亭時、登陸轉附粵漢車先來、數日逗留、得將湖南手屈一指的大城市衡陽作一度巡禮，觀感所得、分述雪泥如左、</p>
<p>城　一瞥　衡陽城分內外、查縣志載「內城高二丈五尺、厚一丈六尺、周圍一千二百七十八尺、外城高一丈餘、城壁至今俱在、城鬥有七　、計東稱賓日、亦稱染　、南稱迴　、西稱西安、北稱膽　、東南稱閣江、也稱鐵　、東北稱瀟湘、西北稱望湖、　內的馬路規模及商　的繁盛、不亞於南昌的中　、而尤以南　街及西正街為全市　、近因湘桂鐵路通車、旅客日見增多、通　街巷、新設旅舍、亦如雨後春　、但當不佞抵達衡陽、下得車來、波江進城後、竟跑上一十來家、才在銀花電影院那兒的湘桂酒家覓得房間、衡城旅舍大多都稱酒家、設備最為完全的、則為廣東酒家、</p>
<p>由西正街轉向南正街的十字路頭、透明的電炬照着「美麗少女理髮」的廣告、原來該處理髮廳林立、一般理髮師均係二八佳人、柔荑繼纖、　聲錚錚、引得一般西裝少年、每當打向門前過，自然而然地舉手摸着自已的腦袋、心裏默問一句「長了嗎？」</p>
<p>夕陽西下、華燈初上、銀花與昇平門前的兩張巨口呑進了成羣的　年男女、兩三小時後又慢慢地吐了出來、原來那兒是在公演着抗戰電影、而出來時、每個一靑年的面部都　露着激昂慨憤的狀態、衡陽是在怒吼了、</p>
<p>風景點點—衡陽在衡山之陽、故名、查南岳峯跨長沙衡陽二境、囘雁為首、　麓為足、歷史攸久、勝跡當然頗多、全縣有八景：</p>
<p>（一）雁峯烟雨、在回雁門外、下有烟雨池、</p>
<p>（二）花藥春溪、在汽車西站東行三里許、</p>
<p>（三）東洲桃浪、在汽車東站南行三里許、洲上有船山寺、為淸彭玉麟紀念王船山　築、</p>
<p>（四）獄亭雪　，在大西鬥外、</p>
<p>（五）石鼓江山在北門外、朱　菴有題額云「一郡佳處」</p>
<p>（六）朱陵後洞、在石鼓山後、為唐董奉先修九華丹法處、、</p>
<p>（七）靑草漁家、在北門外、每當斜陽在山、漁舟唱晚、洵為佳　、</p>
<p>（八）西湖荷花、在小西門外、有愛蓮亭、為宋周敦頤讀書處、</p>
<p>倩女離魂——倩女離魂大約讀過太平廣記的都知道的、故事是這樣：「唐朝有個叫張　的、居住衡　、將他的掌上明珠倩娘、許給了他的外甥玉宙、但在中途忽有　情他字、倩聞鬱抑、宙　　慨、託言赴京、買舟遽行、在舟中夜不成寐、倩娘忽來艙中、相晤之下、决定偕奔、到四川住上五年、產生二子、後來重返衡州、宙擕妻子詣張謝罪、不覺大吃一驚、蓋倩娘並未離開閩閣、臥病在床也、兩女相見、卽翕然成為一體、</p>
<p>不佞住湘桂、飯罷茶餘每興茶博士談心、據博士言、確為事實、現在北門外的九度舖便是會魂的地　，三全縣生活</p>
<p>留衡數日、氣候驟然轉寒、不佞知道這是北風天了、果然的在一個下午同伴的船隻點點風帆駛到了石鼓柱下的靑草橋頭、於是便在次日登陸、僱定肩伕車輛、蜿</p>
<p>地繞着迴雁峯　向湘桂鐵路衡陽西站進發、（自城至站現已有公共汽車、票價每人二角）、其時該路祇通車全縣、我們旣决意來桂、纔暫以終點為目的地、傍晚六時啓行、聽了一夜的轔轔車聲、當東方微現魚肚白時、我們己過了東安、慢慢地向着湖南作別了、原來該路在湖南境內的終點是廟頭站、入廣西境的起點是黃沙河、車釗全境、一路石山林立、峻峭異常、已足令人一爽胸懷、桂林山水稱甲天下，洵不虛負哪、</p>

<p>菲方的足球技術程度、在動年前、水準還很低、然而氣力是該處球人唯一的特長、</p>

<p>這次菲隊應約來港、定使島上迷民、一新眼界、</p>

<h3 id="c57">電影與戲劇 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>娛樂……大傻特傻</p>
<p>Beau　Hunks</p>
<p>是數年前勞萊哈台的的作品、現在新拷貝重行公映、在所有勞萊哈台的作品中、這一部的成績、差是稍差點、片不很長、內容也不甚豐富、片中拌子哈台失意、傷心之上、索性投軍、被派往菲洲、在某一次沙漢行軍、他兩人迷失了路途、却因此救了一個受土人圍困的孤城、勞萊哈台保持着一貫的作風、所憐作的笑料還足够觀衆大笑一塲、</p>
<p>最后……死光爆炸機</p>
<p>Arrest　ofBulldog</p>
<p>Drummon</p>
<p>關於特族門偵探的影片、以前已有過好幾部、但每部都有一個獨立的故事、現在在這部「死光爆炸機」中、演員方面、除了以HE華納代巷約翰巴里穆亞外、餘的沒多大的變更、在所有的特萊門偵探片中、本片有比較曲折驚險的故事、內容描寫特萊門在臨婚的前夕、又因好友某教授被人家暗殺某教授是一個發明家、正在從事死光爆炸機的發明、特萊門為報友仇心切、且事關國防大事、便努力追緝敵蹤、歷盡危險、卒把奸人一網打盡、</p>
<p>全片情節緊張活潑、約翰霍華飾演偵探、演來虎虎有生氣、其餘各演員的演技、也皆各有獨到之處、</p>
<p>平安……小寡婦祕史</p>
<p>That　Certain　Woman</p>
<p>是貝蒂黛維絲和亨利方達、繼「紅彩淚痕」後冉度合作的作品、本片此次公映、在本港巳算是第二次了、</p>
<p>故事叙述一段傷心的婚事、貝蒂飾一工作謀生的寡婦、同一男子戀愛、但因男子父親劇烈反對的緣故、以致婚事不成、可是不幸已懷了孕、不久生了一個小孩、後來那男子在巴黎和另一女子結婚、接着那女子傷了脚部變為殘廢、同時因為同情於丈夫和那寡婦所生的小孩、便犧牲割愛，讓他們重諧水好、</p>
<p>全片悲劇氣氛相當濃厚、幾個高潮點、也很有操縱觀衆情緒的力量、貝蒂黛維絲飾演一受社會環境重重壓迫的寡婦、有深刻動人的演出、亨利方達也很稱職、</p>
<p>東方……母子真情</p>
<p>Of　Human　Heart</p>
<p>是描寫一個家庭的悲劇、父親是一個為宗教權牲一切的傳教士、但他兒子却反對這種工作、以為做醫生比較牧師來得實際、所以經過一次劇烈的爭辯後、兒子便離家學醫、及後老父病死、母親因犧牲一切為兒子籌教育費、及學成適達內戰爆發、救護工作使他感到很大的興趣、因為先前感到家庭所留給他的影家不良、就把老母也忘了、直到經人指責、才感愧血重回到母親的懷抱中、</p>
<p>全片悲劇成份非常濃厚、同時此片雖非戰爭片、可是戰爭及救護等塲、也頗有可觀、幾位主要演員、對我們好像生疏一點、但在演出却並不使人失望</p>
<p>大華……巧女歌聲</p>
<p>Mad　About　Music</p>
<p>是非常動人的悲喜劇、故事因為要成它為喜劇、有些地方、不免比較欠強一點、這當然並不影響影片的本身、導演處理是相當緊凑、每處進展都能抓住喜劇的風趣、</p>
<p>狄娜竇萍演出極為美妙、非但幾支歌曲極動聽、表情亦出色、幾位配角也是很完美的、</p>
<p>新世界……女人世界</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個女子公寓內、一般女寄宿者的故事、在這公富內，包含着各式各型的人物、她們各有各的職業、但是複雜不堪、這其中有女學生、女記者、女推銷員、歌女、舞女……等、舉凡都市中所有的職業女人、在這裏包括殆盡、羣雌粥粥、她們各有着各的遭遇、說她是都市中女人的一個縮影、也未嘗不可、但是全劇劇情的進浪、因為無男人之襯托、顯得非常懈而勉強、引不起觀衆的與趣、同時本片也祇能描寫出一般女人的普通私生活、如擦粉爭吵、而對於廣遍的女性的描寫、始終沒有寫出、這實在是本片失敗的惟一原因、最後因公寓的被炸、全體女人覺悟過來、聯合起來到前線去、也顯得不自然而且公式化、可是、話雖是這樣說、我們也得原諒編導者、以全體女性來演出一部戲、也是一件很困難的事情、</p>
<p>中央……金葉菊續集</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>看過上集的觀衆、總記得在結局時、金葉菊仍被周志誠偷去一對、現在續集中就從這事講起、到金葉菊歸還為止、劇情無上集緊張而曲折、演來亦非常鬆懈、但這中間仍有不少地方能博得一部份愚笨觀衆的眼淚、如鄺山笑之被害而入獄、小燕飛之探監等、民間故事一貫的作風、還是不能避免、我們不需要看過、就能猜到該片劇情、果然遷是想並不鋪製、曹統文不適宜演這種影片、佈景攝影在華南尚可以過去、牧音却是失敗的、</p>
<p>太平……粵劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>

<p>南華南為東方以二比一壓倒後、希望華隊必奪錦標者類皆憂形於色、以南南在聯賽中已比海軍多失一分也、惟我仍抱樂觀、蓋以南南所餘七場比賽、唯足有威脅該隊之力者只海軍一險、而海軍則荊棘尚多、如南華南、東方會、南華華、米杜息等均未重遇故也、南南威力復原後、十九能收橫掃直下之功、海車欠缺射門人才、後此欲收六戰全勝之效、恐有未能耳、</p>
<p>前一週末、所有抱有冠軍希望之足球隊似皆逢尅星、不獨南華南為鍛、據消息傳來、則滬方東華隊一敗於西警、冠軍希望已絕、英國的甲組織業足球聯賽、冠軍希望最濃之「打比」隊、亦被成績平平之「史篤」除以三比零擊敗、而比現居第二位之「伊化頓」隊多失一分也、無獨有偶、遠近皆同、南南差堪自慰矣、</p>
<p>本星期來之本港足球賽會、實為特別銀牌賽與聯賽之重要關頭、南華南重戰九龍會與南華華重戰東方之甲組特別銀牌賽、自是拜六與禮拜兩日最惹人注意之鏡頭、同時、星期六睦軍球塲中南華對五營炮兵之乙組聯賽一戰、亦為乙組極關重要之一幕、現目乙組由南華會、米杜員、軍營炮兵、士葛隊稱四強、其他已喪失爭標希望、四強的形勢如下、</p>
<p>隊名　已賽　勝　和　敗　射球　負球　積分</p>
<p>南華會　十六　十三　二　一　四六　十九　廿八</p>
<p>五營炮兵　十五　十一　三　一　四五　十八　廿五</p>
<p>米杜息　十六　十二　一　三　七十　廿六　廿五</p>
<p>士葛隊　十六　十二　一　三　五　十六　廿五</p>
<p>照上表以觀、則南華本週末而勝、卽盡高出其他三隊五分、冠軍穩得可知、倘不幸而敗、則立受炮兵絕大之威脅，蓋表面雖仍佔首席、實際已比炮兵多失一分也、細考丙組之南華隊、雖仍有亞軍可爭、然冠軍之望已失、願南華軍師以乙組軍為重、本星期末仍以起用丙組中鋒李恩棎作乙組中鋒為宣、自吾之觀察、則此子他日且必成甲組良材者也、</p>
<p>特別銀牌重賽之會、南華南戰九龍會於嘉山、九龍會一失地利便非勁旅、南華十九左劵必操、然凡事不宜大意、倘李天生到時足創未愈、宜仍以李國威為左內衛、前衛線宜用從彥贊替國威、前鋒最好能請李惠堂助陣、此不獨大增進攻之力、且籍此可使球怪預練脚頭、作埠際賽之備、李氏素懷母會、憂戚與共、敢信請則必出、南華華重戰東方一場、兩隊俱是國軍、勝利誰屬、均是可喜、但賽時亦應各以全力相見、共表眞正球藝為宜、如張滿榮足傷己愈、似以此人代替李碩友為宜、吾人更所期望者、則賽時應打銷一切誤會、初會之舉動、到時不願再有所發見、如果林德譜傷創未兪、則南華華陣勢最好莫如下列之布置法、</p>

<p>張滿榮　劉松生　陳德輝　李恩樑　楊水益</p>
<p>有謂今年香港體育、為香港百年夾之最高水準、蓋以為羣賢畢集故然、我說未必、獨是足球守門員則眞成為破天荒之好景、現在雲集港中有名之中國鬥將、有包家平、譚均幹、張榮才、黃紀良、周賢言、新起而突飛孟晉者、有劉顯漢、朱兆恒、李國奇、曾知名一時者又有徐亨、陳其松、蕭殿廉、易贊邦、陳錫培等、還有名聞小型球界之張滿榮、如果將此輩組織起來、可以成一淸一色之守門員足球隊、而且勢力不弱、尚有一亘古所無之喜事、便是我輩報界文弱書生、也能積極向體育之途大加研究、而居然成立有規模之體育特委會、</p>
<p>孤島學生網球技術突飛孟晉、居然能組隊征港、亦是一件可喜之事、昨逢某著名網球家、云該隊有二人球藝甚好、唐寶島最近在練習中、曾以六比三勝却曾代表中國出席台維斯杯之健將江道章一盤、照此以觀、則該隊戰香港大學與南華會兩塲、似甚有勝和把握、我甚願此中能出一兩位如許承基之天才人物、</p>

<h3 id="c60">關於朱偑弦先生 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 春風</p>
<p>無意之中，昨天（二十八日）在本港的某日報社論欄看到了一篇署名佩弦，題目叫「動搖與謠言」的一篇文章，因為我知道朱先生素來不喜談政治的，更從不寫政論文字，並且他是一個極力熱心擁護抗戰者，絕不會做出這些像該文中的「所謂長痛不如短痛，國民事可忍受一時的犧牲以換取長久的安樂。不料政府已敗，而不認敗，可和而不言和，不獨不言和，且高壓主和的領袖……」等等愚昧無知的荒謬之言。所以這裏確有一些奧秘處，這個「佩弦」一定不是今日在雲南西南聯大任中國文學主任的朱佩弦，而定是奸人妄加造做或假托，那是毫無疑問的事。</p>
<p>今日雜然是在這空前的偉大而多轉變的時代，前時是愛國正人君子，今時忽一轉而為盜賣國權喪失人格的大奸大惡，人也鬼也急驟轉變着，但確有一些堅忍不拔，不懼威力，不動搖，不轉變的賢良份子，佩弦先生就是如此，那麼確有聲辯的必要。</p>
<p>佩弦是朱自淸先生的字，前數十年會以「背影」一書馳譽文壇，善寫小品，散文最淸麗，自從古城別後，從不見他的作品了。前些日子，在今日評論裏會護到他的題目叫「新語言」的一篇文字，這還是抗戰來第一次讀到他的文字呢。</p>
<p>他在靑年的學生界裏，大概是盡人皆知的一位教師，他的散文，常是出現在教科書中的，但是他也是一位胄年實際的導師，記得前四年古城的學生在怒吼的時候，他會盡過指導的任務，那一年，正好綏遠風雲緊急，長勝將軍傅作義在百靈廟一次大捷奠定了西北大局，朱先生就會代表了淸華大學到前方慰勞緩遠將士，在他慰勞回來的報告中，他的演詞是滿了戰鬥之熱情，民族之火焰。使人淸楚認識他雖然是一位彬彬有禮而文雅多才之士，但另一面他也是一個生動有力的民族戰士啊。</p>
<p>淸楚記得有一次在淸華中國文學會席上，劉文典先先生同聞一多先生等人談起他們到西北考察的經過，他們都懷着光明希望的烈焰，預知中華民族的偉大反侵略的抗爭，就將開幕了。聞先生曾笑容滿面的說：「看看罷—中國人的利器，都在西北蓄藏着呢！中日戰事不久就會發作起來的。」那時朱劉等先生都為了他們的足跡曾在大抗爭之前徼倖地到過大靑山，發着滿足的欣喜。</p>
<p>前年六月的時候，淸華大學依然在靜恬的空氣中，繼續弦誦，朱先生的課如杜詩宋詩，和散文習作等課，我那要試着選讀或去旁聽。但却因了時間的勵突未得如願。在七月初的時候朱先生依然為了我畢業後的出路細心的計劃着，他多次追問着是到他介紹的天津的某中學呢？還是到廈門的某學校呢？但還未等到我的答覆，古城已經陷入×手了。當我倉皇避到廈門時節，後來接到他的信，知道他也已經平安逃出淪陷的古到長沙了。聯大的文學院還沒有遷到昆明的時候，又曾接到他在蒙自發來的一封信，說蒙自聯大的地處很佳勝，對于將來的再遷昆明，表示留戀。他確是一位心情優美的詩人，同樣又是愛護靑年的良師。當聯大由長沙遷雲南時節，朱先生也是一個堅忍不怕苦的千里徒步者，他的毅力，確是值得人佩服。</p>
<p>如今在香港某報上突然出現的和議謬論，雖然還沒有取得可靠的證據之前，但我們可以先有這麼一個假定、那個作者「佩弦」不是朱自淸先生，根據朱先生歷來一貫的態度，他絕不會自棄一至於此，那麽像某報的妄托他人，假作賣國言論，確是一件不能輕恕的大罪呵！（編者按：本港漢奸報，常故意借用國內作家名字，以淆亂聽聞。這作風最近叛徒們的報紙，也如法泡製了。我們對這鬼把戲，實有戳穿的必要，希讀者們加以注意。）</p>
<h3 id="c61">江陰義民別傳 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>關於這本（江陰義民別傳一（胡山源作，共十六個短篇，世界書局扳，四角）的思想。楊非在「打茶」第八期上已經介紹過，現在我想試一試際究這本書的技巧或藝術。</p>
<p>作者所根據的材料，都牧在附錄，可以讓我們對照着看，明白作者所曾經下過的苦工。比較簡單的似乎是用明祝純嘏的一江陰後錄」和淸計六奇的「黃毓祺起兵竹塘」來寫「黃毓祺」，用「天香閣隨筆」來寫「胡志學」「徐五」和「李介立」，用「虞初新志」來寫「戚三郎」。較費工夫的就從淸韓的「江陰城守紀」，淸許重熙的「江陰城守後紀」以及淸沈濤的「江上遺聞」等篇來寫「許用」「季氏兄弟」「程璧」「王華」「湯三老兒」「凍憲欽」「徐玉揚」等，大約側重點如下：六月初一二日（許用及季氏兄弟），十五日（程璧），七月十二及二十九日（湯三老兒），二十至七二十日（徐玉揚），八月初二日（王華），初八日（陳憲欽）。不過「湯三老兒」和「湯姓童子」不一定就是父子，扭合在一起，更為有趣，這是作者大肌而且聰明的地方，因為小說究竟不是信史，是不必斤斤較量的。「許用」篇中所加的五更調，勸降歌以及答歌雖是作者代擬，却比一語帶過有趣得多。</p>
<p>最複雜的大約是「黃明江」「何氏兄弟」以及「陳二郎」這三篇。黃明江這名字是得自傳說的，所以姓名各人有出入，「江陰城守紀」和「江上遺聞」，寫作黃明江，「後紀」和「鹿樵紀聞」則作「黃雲江，」「天香閣隨筆」又作王雲岡，三個字完全不同。作者斟酌其間，把這五種文宇穿織在一起，並且很有趣的作唱句式的對白，是煞費了一番苦心的。何氏兄弟卽是何常何泰，作者把「明季南略」裏的「兄弟二人」就拉來裝在何氏弟兄頭上了，這也是頗為巧妙的。「陳二郎」雖據「明淸兩代軼聞大歡」，却把城破以後的許多軼事巧妙地組織在一起。開端引用了「難民口述」中的佛殿藏人一節，中段又借陳二郎的遊玩，挿進了兩件悲慘的事實，（女屍影和裸叢婦叢箭，均見天香閣隨筆）就算是陳二郎眼裏看出來的，也頗費匠心。</p>
<p>依我個人的私見，認為下列四篇，當為全書壓卷，就是：「湯三老兒」「陳憲欽」「何氏兄弟」以及「陳二郎」，一方面固然是故事本身刺激性最大，一方面也由於作老的技巧純熱。「湯老兒」寫得如火如荼，像讀水滸三國一樣的有趣。「陳憲欽」一結，故弄狡獪雖未明言水底刺客是誰，但讀者己經無有不知此卽陳憲欽的了。並且，按照野史，這刺客不一定是陳憲欽，作者這樣隱約的寫，倒恰好與野史不悖了。「何氏兄弟」幾乎全篇以錢莊術語比擬對淸兵作戰，語妙絕倫，確是一篇難得的好文章。九歲的「陳二郎」又寫得極可愛，宛如小孩動作和口吻，阿里達不知人與人之問的樂趣，也刻畫入微。</p>
<p>所引為遺憾的，就是「閻典史」這江陰城守的支持者倒不曾有一篇小說，雖然他是典史，究竟也是江陰一義民「，不能因為做了官，就把做百姓的資格取消；况且，他本已歸隱，做典史不過民衆所推戴罷了。還有，沒有女性的抗戰者；比方說，黃毓祺的妻子屢次自殺就是很好的材料，但這未免是求全責備了。</p>

<p>「這是什麽話。老總怎麼就該白吃你的，」</p>
<p>「嘻嘻。」</p>
<p>「到底怎麽賣？」</p>
<p>「一角錢八條，老總。」</p>
<p>「有了錢就好辦。」我望着他，覺得這店主未免太可憐了，為什麽當兵人怕到這種程度？但一仔細想到我們的那些一過去一，也就對于這萎縮不前的人物瞭解着了。是不該輕易怪罪他們的。我接着問，「你有這麽多的存貨，怎麽不打開鬥來買呢？」</p>
<p>「嘻嘻，老總。」</p>
<p>「怕老總們不給錢麽？」</p>
<p>「嘻嘻，從前有些老總，吃了不……」</p>
<p>「吃了不給錢是麽？」</p>
<p>他點點頭。</p>
<p>「最近這邊過過隊伍麽？」</p>
<p>「過過好多。」</p>
<p>「有人買你的蔴花麽？」</p>
<p>「怎麽沒有，」他漸漸有些跟我們熟稔了，「吃的可不少。」</p>
<p>「給你錢麽？」</p>
<p>「全是現錢買貨。」</p>
<p>「有沒有不給錢的？」</p>
<p>「那迫沒有。」</p>
<p>「那你為什麽不開門營業？」</p>
<p>他笑了一笑然後世故地說：</p>
<p>「這年頭的人，誰敢說誰是好人。」</p>
<p>「怪不得你們全街關了門，原來是因為這種原故啊。」</p>
<p>「喀嘻，也是沒有法子，老百姓苦啊。」</p>
<p>「××××××××××。」</p>
<p>「你知道，××××才壞呢，他們吃了你的蔴花，你可別指望要錢。他們不但吃東西不給錢，還××××呢。」</p>
<p>「嘻嘻，人家說×××才文明呢。」</p>
<p>「怎麽個文明法？」</p>
<p>「買東西不但給錢，還要多給錢。」</p>
<p>「還有麽？」</p>
<p>「對於百姓常常周濟。」</p>
<p>我看看王，王看看我。這是一個奇跡。走了一路，還未遇見這樣的人物。然的，他在這以前，一定受過別秤相反的漢奸宣傳。</p>
<p>這能怪他麽？不！教育不够啊！文化落後啊！我走回宿地時，我深深感覺我們的宣傳工作還做得不够。我們對於這方面，還要努力呀！（完）</p>

<p>— 王坪</p>
<p>很多人對貴州是不了解的。以為「堪察加」的貴州，仍然是生活在洋烟的籠罩中。事實上貴州在過去確是如此，更加一般報導貴州的先生們，志抓住貴州的弱點寫通訊，寫特寫。乃至弄得外面人忽視或放過了貴州的長進。</p>
<p>現在鮮明的事實，擺在世人的眼前，貴州確實在抗戰的烽火中，脫去舊的大衣，換上新的衣服及新的內容。看吧，這兒報導的貴州戰地工作團，已經是貴州靑年有組織的上戰塲的第三批了。</p>
<p>他們去年十一月從貴州出發，翻山涉水，萬難千辛，沿途經過不少的大城小邑，總利用時機工作，連在車上也要開研究會，座談會，他們的工作除了做一般對民衆的宣傳外更重要的是對苗，夷，猺……等少數民族宣傳。因為他們內部有幾個就是已經被漢族同化的苗子，對于苗夷的一切風俗習慣言語性格自然是熱習異常，因此，他們編了很多苗歌苗謠，苗故事，……宣傳「小朝進犯大朝」，（就是日本侵略中國的意思）要殺死所有在「大朝」的人，叫苗人都應該團結一心，趕走「小朝」的人馬。同時，更將中國政府對於苗民的實施恩惠講解給他們聽。……這實在是非常重要的工作，而且為過去所忽視的工作。</p>
<p>此外，他們又搜集一切好的風俗民情，及地方政治的長處，以作建設新貴州之設備。</p>
<p>他們一共是一百〇三個人，領隊是貴州省黨部的執行委員陳惕盧先生，還有政治指導員的設備。</p>
<p>所有的團員，多半是中學或小學教師，在未上前綫前，會受了三個月的訓練。為了在前綫工作收效更大起見，更在貴州各縣多鄉村實習了兩個月才出發，因此，在生活上，他們是軍隊化；自己背行李，自已做飯；也是民衆化：並沒有兵的架子。在工作上，他們養成很好的計劃性，集體性；在學習上，有分組與集體兩種方式。更出一「戰工」三日刊，作為練習寫作與發表意見的園地。</p>
<p>講到他們的待遇，那實在是有限得很，每月每人十二塊錢，上至團長下至伙佚都是一樣，可是工作費用却很豐富，除了在本省各界自動捐助的幾千塊錢外，並由省黨部及省抗會津貼，將來也許要劃規第四軍吳奇偉將軍指揮，則經濟條件當更寬裕，工作開展，當更樂觀。</p>
<p>據記者所知，該團團員過去多係優裕窩中的公子小姐，或者是黨派成見甚為森嚴；可是現在大家都抱着刻苦耐勞，消除成見，一致赴戰的磊落，英勇的决心與態度。</p>
<p>前天，他們已經正式上粵漢北段的前綫去了，去的使命，除了工作外，而且代表貴州各界民衆向英勇抗戰將士們慰勞！</p>
<h3 id="c64">雪雲 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 劉籣</p>
<p>雪·血</p>
<p>雪褥上散撒着斑斑的血跡，今晚，捕捉着昨夜的夢，我記起這量緻。</p>
<p>記憶的手更向往昔搜索，揭開童年的帷帳：雪霽跟三叔到山林中去打野兎，一槍中的，鮮紅的血滴染在雪上，那情景，跟昨夜的夢境毫無二致。</p>
<p>憶念起這些，一陣悵惘閃電般的襲上心頭，啊，寶貴的童年，你流向了那方？</p>
<p>生活在關東草原上的三叔，還安然無恙嗎？獵槍的命運又是如何？三叔巳用來獵敵嗎？祖國震盪了一年多，關東呢？山林中國士雲集吧？</p>
<p>又是雪花飄的季節了。但雪褥上，撒着的，再不是野兎的血，而是國士的了。滋養着凍結的大地，開春會茁放出自由勝利花蕾。</p>
<p>海·雲</p>
<p>海咆哮了，擊碎平靜的海上月。它厭棄那安分，訓順的月，海濤翻騰着，銀花碎亂，像是要况入海底。</p>
<p>雲從不知名的遠方奔來，塞滿天空，呑蝕了月，大地是漆黑的，覆壓在洶湧的海面上。</p>
<p>夜風吹起烏雲的哀愁，哭泣了——大雨來了。</p>
<p>天空扯着閃電。間隙的光亮，照耀出瘋狂的海，浪淸像是要冲毀這世界，大地搖動了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Proposals of the Fifth Plenary Session <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT) was convened at the beginning of the second phase of the all-out War of Resistance. The second phase of the War of Resistance is a stage of turning defeat into victory, and weakness into strength, which has the significance of completing the entire undertaking of resisting the war and building the nation on the basis of the first phase. Therefore, this supreme meeting of the Kuomintang, which leads the War of Resistance, naturally carries a very important mission, and the people of the whole country are also eagerly awaiting the announcement of the resolutions. Although the process and resolutions of this meeting have only been fully announced today, the gains of this meeting are quite significant. Just in terms of the assembly situation, the number of people at this assembly was even more than the previous three times. Although the discussion only lasted for one week, the resolutions were quite specific and in line with current needs. Here are some thoughts on its achievements: According to the main resolutions published in various newspapers, there are sixteen in total, covering all aspects of party, government, military, and economic construction. Regarding the resolutions on party and government affairs, the most important ones are roughly three points: (1) Emphasis on the implementation of methods to improve lower-level party and government organizations; (2) Improving the working methods of the party; (3) Children of party, government, and military personnel at all levels should lead by example in serving in the military. These are very important resolutions. If we speak in the spirit of "not refusing medical treatment for illness," the experience of the eighteen months of the War of Resistance has indeed made us feel that the lower-level party and government organizations are too unsound, and the staff is too corrupt. Furthermore, during the process of the War of Resistance, the upper-level party and government organizations were constantly being improved, but the reform of the lower-level party and government organizations was very lagging behind. Therefore, the work efficiency of the party has also been greatly affected. In addition, party and government personnel at all levels evade responsibility and cannot set an example for the general public, which further hinders the progress of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the resolutions on military affairs, the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council is the most important. According to a special dispatch from Chongqing in this newspaper a few days ago, the Supreme National Defense Council established this time has a more substantial organization than the existing National Defense Conference. It has been decided that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will concurrently serve as the chairman, and the other six members will be filled by two party and government leaders and two highly respected "celebrities outside the government." Here, we can point out two points of progress: (1) The organizational members of the Supreme National Defense Conference are no longer limited to military personnel, but also include party and government leaders. The discussions and resolutions of the National Defense Conference in the future should be better able to adapt to the objective needs of mutual cooperation between the party, government, and military; (2) The Supreme National Defense Conference in the future will no longer be just an organization for upper-level leadership in the War of Resistance. The addition of celebrities outside the government to its organization can, on the one hand, show that our political institutions are becoming increasingly democratic as needed by the War of Resistance. On the other hand, the highest leading body of the War of Resistance can also gain insight into public sentiment and adapt to the demands of the people through the participation of celebrities outside the government, so as to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the selection of these two candidates from outside the government is of great importance. The main condition is that they truly understand public sentiment and can represent the will of the people. Although the candidates seem to have been internally determined, their relationship is of great importance, so I do not hesitate to bother and remind the authorities of this here. Secondly, improving the conscription methods is also a very important resolution. We often hear many black scenes of conscription fraud in various places, and its disadvantages even affect the people's aversion to war. Today, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, which focuses on "building the army," the improvement of the conscription method is an urgent issue.</p>
<p>The remaining resolutions, generally speaking, are all about methods of economic construction. The main points are nothing more than improving the plan for wartime finance and finance, promoting the production, construction and control of the western provinces, improving foreign trade, and stepping up the promotion of cooperative undertakings. Among them, the improvement of wartime finance and finance is the most important. Not only can it increase the source of huge expenses for military and political affairs, but it can also stabilize wartime industry and the social economy, such as regulating local finance. In addition, encouraging the exchange of cash, silver, and strengthening gold production work and efficiency is also an important case for improving wartime finance. Secondly, improving production and trade is also an important strategy, because war is a huge consumption. In order to fill this consumption, there are only two active methods: one is to increase domestic production, and the other is to increase international income. In this resolution, the regulations on these two parts are quite specific. In terms of production, the focus is on the construction and control of the west. The specific methods are to promote and encourage handicrafts and step up the promotion of cooperative undertakings. In terms of foreign trade, the focus is on encouraging exports and improving foreign exchange. These resolutions are of course basic key points for economic construction, but we still hope that the authorities can do three more things based on these basic resolutions, namely stabilizing legal tender, dredging finance, and facilitating people's transport.</p>
<p>In addition to the resolutions, this conference has two major gains: the anti-war concepts and specific methods indicated by the Chairman's speech, and the three principles indicated in the plenary declaration for promoting anti-war strategies: namely, strengthening unity, actively fighting, and stepping up construction. Regarding the Chairman's instructions, I have already written an article to elaborate on them a few days ago. Now I will briefly talk about the latter three principles. Our War of Resistance is a great undertaking of all-out war, so we must "be united as a country, and have one heart from top to bottom" in order to overcome all difficulties and achieve success. However, unity values sincerity, so all parties and factions must cooperate sincerely with the spirit of "mutual trust." Secondly, our War of Resistance is to fight for final victory, and this kind of War of Resistance is the most difficult fact, so there is a danger of giving up halfway through because of fear of difficulties. The so-called "he who travels a hundred miles is only halfway to ninety" refers to this. We are now only one step away from success. If we can take ten more miles, the final goal can be achieved; otherwise, all previous efforts will be wasted. Therefore, the whole country must endure and overcome this final hurdle. Again, the point about stepping up construction is the key to the specific methods of the War of Resistance. We have repeatedly discussed economic construction, but construction is not limited to the economy. In addition, spiritual construction and political construction are even more important. We must carry forward the education of the Prime Minister's soldier spirit, so that 450 million people will have the spirit of "if we don't succeed, we will die for the cause." We must also "strictly enforce rewards and punishments, comprehensively examine the reality, concentrate our strength, and increase efficiency," especially "strengthen people's organizations, unify people's actions, relieve people's suffering, and improve people's lives" in order to implement political construction.</p>
<p>In short, the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session this time are practical and specific. We sincerely hope that the central and local governments at all levels can implement and promote them in accordance with these resolutions.</p>
<p>Correction: There are three errors in the editorial on the 28th. They are corrected as follows: In the eleventh line of the lower paragraph, "The basic spirit of a planned economy lies in the Three People's Principles of centralization" should be "…democratic centralization." In the thirtieth line of the lower paragraph, "Especially the discipline issue one" should be "…the Party's discipline issue." In the thirty-second line of the lower paragraph, "The Kuomintang is the party of the War of Resistance" should be "The Kuomintang is the party leading the War of Resistance."</p>

There has been fierce fighting in Da'an, Gu Ren, and Yongle in recent days. × has suffered 2,000-3,000 casualties, and we have also suffered considerable losses. The battle lines in Xia County, Jiang County, and Pinglu are under our control. × is conducting intense guerrilla warfare against us. × is attempting to invade westward again at Hejin, but we have already blocked them.</p>
<p>Shanxi × Troops Harass in Multiple Directions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 30th] Military intelligence: × aircraft at Yuncheng have increased to 30-40 in recent days. At Zhangcun and Qucun in southern Yuncheng, there are × 600-700 troops with 7-8 cannons. At Dunhualing and Jiling, there are × over 3,000 troops with over 10 cannons. Since the 23rd, under air cover, they have launched attacks towards Huanglongling, Majiazhuang, and Taohuacha (southeast of Jie County), currently engaged in fierce fighting with our army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 30th] In recent days, × has increased by over 2,000 troops from Yuncheng towards the north, with unclear intentions. × has recently been attacked by our army in Wanquan and other places, with extremely fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yanqu, 30th] The × troops at Huo County launched a two-pronged attack on us at 9:00 AM on the 28th, but were repelled. One group of over 1,500 infantry and artillery, accompanied by four mountain guns, advanced towards our Shawo Li via Qingcao Ping and Yin Di Cun. Our Ai Regiment pre-emptively controlled forces in favorable areas north and south. At noon, × successively entered the vicinity of Shawo Li. At 1:00 PM, our Tian Battalion launched a frontal attack, while the Wang and Guan Battalions launched pincer attacks from the Xiacheng Cun and Jian Kou towards the north and south of ×, respectively. After two hours of fierce fighting, × suffered heavy losses and collapsed. Another group of over 300 infantry advanced towards Jugu Li via Shangxia Dong Ping, but were repelled by Zhang Battalion of our Yue Regiment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yanqu, 30th] After capturing He Shun County in eastern Shanxi on the 23rd, over 3,000 × troops, a portion of over 1,000 troops, advanced along the Liaohe Highway towards Liao County. On the 27th, they reached Hanhu Town, and on the 28th, they reached Caojiazhai. Our army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with × in favorable areas to prevent their advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 30th] Over 1,000 × troops, with over 100 cavalry and nine cannons, launched a four-pronged attack on our Chajianling and Yangjiachuan positions on the morning of the 24th. Our army pre-emptively dispersed its forces and responded with tactical methods. × was unable to grasp our position and retreated. Our army killed over 50 × troops.</p>
<p>Our Armies Achieve Successive Victories in Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 30th] Over 200 × troops from Yingshan, with two cannons, arrived at Haojiadian from Longquan Town and engaged in fierce fighting with our guerrillas for about four hours. × troops were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed eastward. In this battle, the × commander, Captain Ota Kan, was killed, along with over ten soldiers and over ten horses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 30th] The × troops at Bailu Ji have been harassing various places in recent days. Yesterday, a part of them sneaked to Hejiaqiao, about ten miles away from Zhuqiao. Our army has dispatched a team to meet them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wanjia Bu, 30th] Our commando team destroyed the railway at Danjia Da Wu on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway on the night of the 26th. They encountered over 200 × troops and engaged them. After completing their mission, we immediately withdrew.</p>
<p>Our Aircraft Bomb × Warships</p>
<p>[Foreign Dispatch from This Port] According to Chinese sources from Guangzhou Bay this morning, Chinese Air Force bombed Japanese warships parked near Weizhou Island yesterday. It is not yet known whether they were hit. It is also reported that Chinese aircraft also bombed the Japanese army on Sanzao Island.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 31st] After the situation in Shameen gradually returned to normal, the ban on Chinese entering the area has now been relaxed compared to before. Chinese can freely enter and exit between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Martial law remains in effect in Guangzhou, and Chinese and foreigners passing through traffic checkpoints must still present permits for inspection by Japanese sentries. The puppet "Maintenance Association" is currently starting to organize a police force to maintain public order, issuing orders for former police officers to return to their districts to serve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 30th] On the 28th, over 600 × infantry, over 100 cavalry, and dozens of cannons arrived at Jiujiang. The commander is Major Akio. There are also over 100 × troops at Heqing, numbered as the 3rd Detachment of the Terakawa Garrison. They often send small teams to harass nearby villages.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st] At 1:35 PM on the 31st, eight × aircraft took off from Beihai and invaded the skies over Nanning, dropping bombs. At the same time, three × aircraft dropped bombs in Zhaoqing. The extent of the damage is unknown.</p>
<p>[Enlightenment Society, Rapid News from the South Road] Since the invasion of Guangzhou, the southern invading × army has been in place for more than three months. Aside from being able to defend only the outer lines of Nanhai, Panyu, Sanshui, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Shunde, they have made no further progress. With protracted campaigns failing and war fatigue setting in, the internal contradictions and negative trends of anti-war fervor and financial panic, and the depletion of troop resources are growing more and more prominent. In order to remedy this situation, the × warlords have recently increased naval deployments to Weizhou Island, attempting to land in Guangxi via the Southern Route, Anpu, Beihai, and Qinzhou Bay, cutting off our country's southwest international transportation routes. They also appear to be using the strategy of elite troops to strike quickly, launching attacks in four directions. According to military analysts, the offensive plans of these four directions of × troops will focus on three prongs for the main attack, with one prong as a supporting attack. The main attacks will be: (1) along the Anpu-Lianjiang-Shijiao highway to enter southern Guangxi, Chuanchuan, Yulin, Beiliu, using Beiliu as a base; (2) from the Beiliu base, dividing forces eastwards to Rongxian and Cenxi, to encompass Wuzhou and Taizhou, and westwards to Xingye Guixian and Binyang to seize Yongning; (3) splitting off from Beihai via Qinxian to attack Yongning, encompassing Longzhou Zhennanguan, to cut off Guizhou-Vietnam traffic; (4) as a supporting prong, splitting off from Anpu Lianjiang to Huaxian, Maoming, Xinyi, and Luoding, to occupy Nanjiangkou, cutting off the Xijiang traffic, attempting to shake our army teams, and the positions of Gao Yao and other places in Xijiang, using electric launches and bark boats to leap forward along the river from the river mouth of Sanshui. Examining the strength of the × army, they are on the verge of exhaustion. The limited number of troops sent to the Southern Route this time is a trick using the strategy of elite troops to break through. Geographically speaking, this type of troop advancement strategy of × is several times more difficult than leaping forward along the Xijiang River from the front, because the Gou Lou Mountains on the Guangdong-Guangxi border extend from Annam into the border, with the main peak, Gou Lou Mountain, located southeast of Beiliu County. Its rocky holes and curved leaks stretch from Rong County to Beilun Pass, eastward to the Shiwan Da Mountains, Yunkai Da Mountains, branching into the Yunwu Mountains, stretching across Qinzhou, Lianjiang, Gaozhou, Huaxian, Luoding, Yunfu, and Yulin, which can serve as bases for guerrilla teams in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Gui province army from Huaiji Cangwu in the southeast, to Longzhou Nanning in the west, has stationed heavy troops in mountain passes and strategic locations, defending them tightly. Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters and concurrently Chief of Staff, yesterday ordered Xia Wei, Commander-in-Chief of the West Route, to sit in Wuzhou, and Military Commander Liao Lei to sit in Guiping, to preside over military affairs. On the Guangdong side, Hepu Beihai is defended to the death by Gui army division commander Huang Gu, leading troops in cooperation with Qinlian Garrison Commander Mo Shujie. Wu Fei, the Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District, leads the Hepu County Guerrilla Commander of the League Zhuding Hua, the Lingshan Commander Huang Zhisheng, the Qinxian Commander Huang Tongcai, the Fangcheng Commander Mao Xiangcheng, the Suixi Commander Li Jiaju, and the Haikang Commanders Lin Zhaotong and Xuwen Cai Rongchun, leading the self-defense teams of each county to defend key passes. Zhou Jingzhen, the Administrative Inspector of the Seventh District, leads the Maoming County Guerrilla Commander Huang Maoquan, the Huaxian Commander Pang Cheng, the Wuchuan Commander Huang Zhen Lianjiang Commander Kuang Wu,</p>
<p>Commander Xiao Qiu, Xinyi Commander Lai Dongrong, Dianbai Commander Tang Wei, Yangjiang Commander Chen Xiujue, etc., leading the self-defense teams of each county to defend key passes. All divisions, replenishment regimental units, have been sent to Huaxian, Huijiang and other places to gather for war preparations. Gui army commander Xia Wei, has previously increased and transferred two elite divisions to Anpu Beihai to increase defenses. If × were to invade Gui from the Southern Route, a major war will unfold in the mountainous areas on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. All of the × army's heavy weapons, tanks, and other mechanized units will lose their effectiveness. The assistance of aircraft will also be made more difficult due to the complexity of the rocky mountains. Geographically speaking, the × army will definitely be unable to fight the war in the Southern Route, increasing its number of deaths, injuries, and illnesses, leading to difficulties in terms of finance, economy, politics, diplomacy, and military affairs, and hastening their collapse.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Shanghai Dispatch: Since × launched its war of aggression against China, it has consumed a great amount of ammunition and military supplies. Because its domestic steel is insufficient, it has forcibly demanded it from various war zones. Recently, it has forced the puppet government to hold iron donation campaigns on behalf of various puppet counties and cities. The × transport Akita Maru, fully loaded with 1,000 tons of copper and iron, set sail for Japan on the 30th.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 31st] The Philippine Islands Police Chief, Mr. Ramos, recently went to Maya Bay to investigate the conflict involving Japanese fishermen on January 19th. He has now completed the investigation and returned to Alki City in northern Luzon, reporting the details of the incident here: The Japanese fishing boat Beya Maru, carrying 28 fishermen, sailed into the port and refused inspection by the water patrol, leading to a dispute. A water patrol ship happened to be passing by and opened fire, injuring the Japanese shipowner, who was then arrested and is currently being held. At the same time, Manila officials have now begun to strictly prohibit private fishing, and 25 fishing boats have been suspended from sailing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] The wireless telephone between Xinjiang and Chongqing made its first test call on the 30th. In the future, transportation in the northwest will be more convenient, truly opening a new era in the history of transportation in our northwest. Previously, the Dihua Radio Telegraph and Wireless Telephone Bureau under the Xinjiang Provincial Government Transportation Office purchased the latest wireless machinery and equipment at great expense, and actively arranged everything. Everything was ready, and it officially opened in Dihua on the 30th. On the afternoon of the 30th, at 4:30 PM, the provincial chairman, Li Rong, made the first test call to the province's representative in Chongqing, Zhang Yuanfu, via wireless telephone. Chairman Li asked Representative Zhang to pay respects to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, the presidents of various academies, and various military leaders, and said that the whole of Xinjiang is peaceful and the masses are extremely concerned about the war situation. Zhang then reported on the recent political situation in the central government. The two sides spoke for twelve minutes, and the sound was clear. The wireless telephone will be officially put into use soon.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Seiyukai Diet Member Kono Criticizes the Hiranuma Cabinet, Pointing Out that the Current Cabinet Lacks Popular Support; Friction Between the Diet and the Cabinet Intensifies <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] Tokyo Dispatch: The × Diet's interrogation campaign is becoming increasingly sharp, revealing that ×'s internal unease and anxiety are like a volcano, beginning to erupt. In both houses of the × Diet, there are many questions regarding the so-called policy of building a "New Order in East Asia," but Hiranuma and Arita's answers still do not deviate from Konoe's statements. In the morning, Seiyukai Diet member Kono Ichiro made a frontal attack on the Hiranuma Cabinet in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, which is noteworthy as it is an unprecedented phenomenon since the outbreak of the war and the last Diet session. Kono said that the Hiranuma Cabinet is the most unpopular cabinet in Japanese history. First, because the Hiranuma Cabinet is an extension of the Konoe Cabinet, and Konoe has already lost popular support, how can Hiranuma reverse the situation? Second, because the Hiranuma Cabinet has no concrete policies that can win the support of the whole country. When Kono asked questions, the entire room was silent, and the cabinet members on the stage listened attentively. Hiranuma, Itagaki, and Yonai frequently exchanged wry smiles. Hiranuma then stood up to answer, saying that the current cabinet is not an extension of the Konoe Cabinet. Although the current cabinet continues the previous cabinet's policy of establishing a "New Order in East Asia," one should not immediately assume that the current cabinet also continues all other policies of the previous cabinet. Kono rose again to attack, expressing his dissatisfaction with Hiranuma's response, but hoping that Hiranuma would quickly reorganize the cabinet and recruit new figures. Thus, a battle of words barely came to an end, but the friction between the Diet and the cabinet, the friction between political parties and Hiranuma, and the anger of the people in the country were all clearly visible. When Seiyukai Diet member Haraguchi asked, in order to carry out a long-term war, it is necessary to make a living and occupy the area. Itagaki replied that he felt the same way and would pay more attention to it. Haraguchi then asked, what are the specific strategies for the joint anti-communist problem? Arita replied that it was under study and could not be made public. Haraguchi then turned to question when the war expenses, which were so huge, would continue. Ishiwatari replied, "I don't know yet, but we should make sure that it is not wasted." From this, it can be seen that in the × House of Representatives, there is a deep aversion to war due to the burden of such huge military expenses, which cannot be extended any further. Oriental Society Diet member Kita Ikki continued to ask, "The military authorities have a tendency to emphasize North China and downplay Central China and South China. We must know that the importance of Central China and South China is no less than that of North China. What is the cabinet's policy?" Itagaki replied, "The military authorities have not downplayed Central China and South China. After Konoe's statement was released, there was a rumor that troops would be withdrawn from Central China and South China, but this is actually a rumor." Yonai also replied, "The navy and the army have the same opinion." From this, it can be seen that the so-called Konoe statement is completely insincere. The Japanese warlords not only want to place North China under their control, but they also tightly grasp Central China and South China. The poison of their intentions is obvious. Kita continued to ask, "What is the period of stationing troops in China?" Itagaki replied, "The period of stationing troops depends on the needs of security and combat, and cannot be predicted." Kita asked again, "How is the food supply for the troops in China resolved?" Itagaki replied, "A part of it is levied locally, and in the future we will strive to have it all supplied locally." From this, it can be seen that × is trying to levy our country's food supply to supply its troops, saving labor and reducing the burden of transportation. We should thoroughly destroy their tricks.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] Army Minister Itagaki declared in the Diet yesterday that the recent rumors that Japanese military operations in Central China and South China will end soon are completely unfounded. At the same time, Navy Minister Yonai also said that even if the war situation comes to an end, Japan will still send the navy to China to garrison.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 31st] Education Minister Araki gave a speech in the Diet, expressing regret over the issue of some professors violating the law. However, the Japanese government will purge dangerous elements in imperial universities to achieve the goal of building an ideal university. Also, Treasury Minister Ishiwatari said in the Diet that extreme attention has been paid to the development of the economic productivity of Japan, its puppet states, and China.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Hengyang Four Major Events (Continued from yesterday's Second Edition) <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>"Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" Movement</p>
<p>Hengyang is located at a vital point on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, making it one of the gathering places for wounded soldiers. In addition to several collections of cotton clothes and quilts and regular慰勞 (consolation/comfort) efforts, local people, along with a foreign friend, organized a "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" movement and are preparing to expand the movement nationwide.</p>
<p>The meaning of "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" can be fully understood from the name itself; it is organized entirely to serve the wounded soldiers. They initiated two movements in Hengyang to wash clothes and cut hair for the wounded soldiers, and the results were quite good. It is only a pity that the organization is not very sound, lacking dedicated personnel and more people/groups participating to widely promote the movement. It seems that it has now reached a "standstill."</p>
<p>Establishment of a Symposium on Anti-Japanese War Work</p>
<p>It is said that Hengyang is the most complex place in Hunan, and the deep-rooted feudal forces are unmatched by other places. Based on the reporter's observations over a long period, this is indeed the case: the struggle between new and old forces, and the internal contradictions within the new and old forces, can be seen from all aspects.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the anti-Japanese war work, everyone acts on their own, indifferent to each other—and even slandering each other. This is indeed a great loss to the work. After several lessons, everyone felt that they should overcome this immediately, otherwise, the devil's hands of the × people will soon reach this ancient city. However, no one was willing to propose it, so the newly created "New Stage" ten-day publication and the visiting group, the Eighth Team of the Anti-Japanese Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Commission, raised this request at a meeting to welcome the Guizhou War Zone Working Group. It immediately received a satisfactory response. Each group immediately sent a representative to form an "Anti-Japanese War Work Symposium." All working groups and cultural institutions in Hengyang were members. They met once a week, and each group took turns convening. The topic of the symposium was determined at the previous meeting and could be added or deleted by the convener. The first symposium has already been held. The topics discussed were how to develop the work in Hengyang and strengthen the anti-Wang Jingwei movement.</p>
<p>Slowly, Hengyang will stand up in the anti-Japanese war, stand taller, and contribute more.</p>
<p>Finally, a new publication "New Stage" has been published here, with Wen Tao, a famous woodcut artist, and Xiang Yu as the persons in charge. This is entirely a people's publication. The first issue contains the full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions, Zhou Enlai's discussion of the recent war situation, a special anti-Wang Jingwei issue, and Mr. Ye Jianying's "The War Situation in the New Stage" written specifically for the publication...etc. The sales are quite good, and it is likely to become one of the cultural pillars of the Southwest.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: Today, the House of Representatives held a budget debate, which discussed strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact and war expenses. Seiyukai member Haraguchi first proposed strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact. Haraguchi argued that the pact should be strengthened. Foreign Minister Arita replied that although various newspapers have different records of the purpose of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the pact was originally established by the contracting countries to jointly prevent communist "destructive activities" and had no other purpose. The Foreign Minister declined to explain what specific measures the Japanese government is currently considering to stop the "destructive activities" of the Communist Party. As for war expenses, Japanese Minister of Finance Ishiwata said that it is still difficult to determine when the Japanese government will issue the war expenses raised for the "Sino-Japanese Incident." However, the war expenses raised by the Japanese government due to the European War started in 1916 and continued for ten years. The war expenses used during the European War were paid separately by the government, he said.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that regarding the recent meeting of Japanese ambassadors and ministers to several European countries in Paris, although various newspapers have different records, its purpose was to have the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, report on the news about China and Japan to the ambassadors. The spokesman also hinted that similar meetings will be held in Berlin and Rome.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Zhejiang Province Controls Freight Transport in Oujiang and Ningbo Rivers <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Wenzhou and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang are the only navigable ports after the war. The export of native products from the interior and the import of foreign goods are both transshipped through the two ports. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is planning to establish a Monopoly Bureau to control freight transport and develop the efficiency of transportation, while also organizing joint water and land transport with Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hunan provinces. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo Volume Soars at Ningbo and Oujiang Ports After the war, the volume of cargo entering and leaving the ports of Wenzhou and Ningbo has soared. The original customs has increased the number of customs officers to provide services, and tax revenue has increased accordingly. For example, last year, the value of goods imported into Wenzhou Customs was 1,923,000 yuan in national currency, and the value of goods exported was 6,240,000 yuan in national currency. The value of goods imported into Ningbo Customs was 1,212,000 yuan in national currency, and the value of goods exported was 4,768,000 yuan in national currency. The increase in exports set a new record for the two ports. In the previous year, Ningbo Customs exported only 26,000 yuan, and Wenzhou Customs exported only 541,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Monopoly Bureau to Control Freight Transport The Zhejiang Provincial Government, recognizing that Wenzhou and Ningbo have become important ports for the import and export of goods from various inland provinces, resulting in a limited number of ships and a state of undersupply, causing shipowners to arbitrarily raise prices, and merchants to feel great pain, has now planned to establish a Monopoly Bureau by the Finance Department to control freight transport in the Oujiang and Ningbo Rivers in order to regulate the social economy, dredge freight transport, increase provincial treasury revenue, and develop the efficiency of transportation.</p>
<p>Joint Water and Land Transport Has Already Been Implemented Zhejiang has already implemented joint water and land transport with Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces. The highways of the above provinces have been interconnected, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been connected to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and the first section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway has been completed and opened to traffic. Therefore, the main native products of various provinces are transported to Hong Kong or Shanghai, and the necessary foreign goods are imported through the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou. The Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group has approved foreign ships to operate on the Ningbo-Wenzhou port and the Ningbo-Wenzhou-Shanghai routes, with the aim of promoting the export of native products from the interior on foreign ships.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency Barcelona, 31st] A Haitong News Agency reporter flew over the Catalan front yesterday to inspect the route of the government forces' retreat in recent days, but it was difficult to get a clear picture. After the rebel army launched a general offensive, the government forces immediately destroyed all positions that could not be defended. The destroyed ruins were clearly visible from the air, but after retreating further, they were no longer visible. It has been clearly proven that the strength of the government forces is deteriorating day by day. It is predicted that their final struggle will be on the line of Forsa, Lis, Igualada, and Manresa.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Rome, 31st] General Gabara, commander of the Italian volunteer army in Spain, recently sent a detailed report to Mussolini, describing the active achievements of the Italian volunteer army in the Battle of Barcelona.

No one may evade military service, and it will be as if every citizen is a soldier. The reasonable deployment of all military, political, party affairs, economic, and financial matters will be enough to support the long-term war of resistance to await the collapse of × country. In addition to the deployment of positions sufficient to deal with stubborn × at the front, we also have considerable preparations to recover the national territory and build a modern country in the future.</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 31st] The "Military Service Agency" responsible for handling national conscription affairs has been officially established today, with Mr. Chen Huishu (transliteration) serving as the director.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 31st] The Chairman's Chongqing Headquarters ended on the 31st. The reporter specifically visited Director Zhang, asking about the measures after the end.

He He was announced as the director of this headquarters. The reporter also asked if there was a rumor that an Executive Office would also be established in Ningyuan. Zhang replied that Ningyuan has excellent natural endowments and abundant products, which urgently need to be developed. It has now been decided to set up an Executive Office to take charge of its affairs. The recent central plenary meeting paid extreme attention to the economic construction of the Southwest, and a major plan has been determined and plans have been passed. The future development is naturally immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Hitler's Speech: Demands Colonies, Declares Intention to Aid in Wartime, Openly Shields Japan's Invasion of China <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, January 31st] Hitler's long-awaited speech to the Reichstag was finally delivered last night at the Kroll Opera House. The theater was filled, with not only all members of the Reichstag in attendance, but also members of the diplomatic corps. Overall, the entire speech contained no surprises, nor did it hint at any future actions of the Nazi Party. The main points of the speech were roughly: (1) to reiterate the demand for colonies; (2) to reaffirm that Germany would be Italy's ally in wartime; (3) to make clear that Germany would not tolerate any interference from Western countries in its internal affairs. Furthermore, Hitler fiercely attacked Jews, stating, "If international Jewish financiers attempt to incite another great war, the result will not be the destruction of Germany, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe." At the beginning of his speech, Hitler recounted to the 85 members of the "Greater German" Reichstag the circumstances of the Nazi Party's rise to power on January 30th six years prior. "At that time, approximately 130 million male and female citizens voted, supporting the Nazi Party under my leadership. Another 20 million voters were scattered among about 15 other small parties, united only by their shared hatred of the Nazi movement. They engaged in a long-term struggle against the Nazi Party, vying for leadership and colluding with Jews to protect their interests. Bishops with political agendas in various churches blessed these individuals. The situation was such that only a 'miracle' in the final moment could save Germany's life. We were confident in this 'miracle,' while our enemies mocked it. If Germany had indeed fallen into Bolshevik chaos, Western civilization as a whole would have faced an unimaginable crisis. The emergence of Mussolini and Italian Fascism marked the beginning of a glimmer of hope in Europe. After our Nazi Party gained power, we expanded this movement on another front. Today, we witness the international Jewish conspiracy being bravely overthrown by us, as they sought to diminish Europe and its culture. Over six years, we have realized dreams of centuries past, though the ignorant and unknowing may believe we have not experienced any struggles. They fail to realize that before the unification of Germany this year, we fought bitterly for our political ideals for nearly 20 years. We held firm resolutions, acted bravely, and fought for the victory of these ideals." Hitler then revisited the events of 1938, explaining in detail the annexation of Austria and the final unification of "East Prussia" with Germany. "We expedited the success of all these endeavors with breathless speed. Our faith in the swiftness and efficiency of the new German army has not only not disappointed us but has surpassed our expectations." Hitler mentioned the German army's mobilization during the Czech crisis, saying, "We did not threaten anyone. We merely sought to defend ourselves against unwarranted interference from third parties. This has been the case in the past, and it will be in the future. If any Western European country interferes in matters solely concerning us, preventing the fair and natural resolution of these issues, we will absolutely not tolerate it. Our good friend Mussolini suggested that we should immediately seek out certain principles that would not only allow for the peaceful resolution of pressing issues but also provide a rational approach to all other important matters. We were all delighted by this suggestion. The composed acceptance of Mussolini's proposal by Chamberlain and Daladier is also worthy of our respect. Such unity among strong nations could not have been achieved without a determination to find a solution to this problem. While we do not need to brandish swords to achieve domestic unity, we must resort to such measures for self-defense in the face of external intimidation. German youth have undergone their first trial and emerged with honor." Hitler then solemnly declared that for a country to be strong, it must have domestic discipline, order, and unified national action.</p>
<p>German Economy Hitler also mentioned the economic situation in Germany and foreign rumors of an impending economic collapse due to a "credit panic," stating, "One thing is fully understood by the German people: Germany has always been in a particularly difficult economic position. There is no doubt that we must fight, but there is also no doubt that we will achieve victory. And I dare to tell you plainly that we have already won." Hitler denied the claims by democratic nations that Germany coveted the Netherlands. He stated, "Some people falsely claim that because the political systems of countries like America, South America, and the Netherlands differ from Germany's, we will attack them. This is absolutely untrue. We have no desire to export National Socialism." Hitler also stated that from an economic perspective, depriving Germany of its colonies was utterly meaningless. Before the war, democratic politicians heard that British trade would greatly increase after Germany's disintegration, but after the war, the British people were not any wealthier than before. "Germany's strength today is unprecedented. We do not want to use colonies as bases for troop deployment. We are quite content with our large population. However, we need colonies to solve Germany's economic problems. We need to buy food and raw materials and sell manufactured goods. The quality of our products is no less than that of other countries. Economists often say that the value of currency is based on gold reserves. This is ridiculous. We believe that the value of the German Mark must be based on the ability of its workers and the quality of its products. To alleviate Germany's economic difficulties, first, its living space should be expanded. Currently, this space cannot be fully utilized by Germany, so Germany must increase exports. From an economic standpoint, returning colonies to Germany is the more sensible approach. It is more important to provide jobs for seven million unemployed people than to increase wages. We must export goods to buy food, or we will starve to death. However, I can assure you that the German people will continue to survive, and their leaders are willing to exert every effort to work diligently. Furthermore, Germany harbors no hatred towards Britain and France and wishes to live in peace with them. We have already used German newspapers as our mouthpiece to respond to all those who profit from war, and we have told Germans that Germany has an average population of about 135 people per square mile, with no room to accommodate Jews. Other countries have more room, but they say they cannot accommodate them. If the international Jewish financial group launches another war, the result will not be the destruction of Germany but the annihilation of Jews throughout Europe."</p>
<p>Disarmament Issues Hitler addressed the relationship between politics and religion, stating, "If the Church feels dissatisfied with the current situation, Germany is prepared to follow the example of the United States and separate politics and religion." Hitler expressed his views on disarmament issues, stating, "It would be more appropriate for all countries to first negotiate political and colonial issues with Germany from an economic standpoint, rather than wasting huge amounts of money on arms merchants and burdening the people. Conversely, if politicians in other countries want to threaten us with economic sanctions, I can assure you that if this happens, it will trigger an economic war. In this war, we will be better equipped to cope than other countries whose 'productivity has already exceeded the saturation point.' Furthermore, if Italy is drawn into war, Germany will absolutely assist Italy. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany will guarantee the safety of European culture. Germany's assistance to the Spanish Nationalists was because Germany did not want Spain to become Bolshevik. The Nationalists will save the Spanish people and annihilate 'political missionaries' or enemies of the Spanish people. Germany had previously attempted to unite various Protestant churches but failed due to the resistance of a few bishops. I believe the world will have a long period of peace; only rumor-mongers believe war is imminent. Germany has no territorial demands on Britain and France, except for colonies. If they think the colonies are worthless, they should return them to Germany, which would not displease them. It is ridiculous for some to claim that Germany is incapable of managing colonies. If we examine the arguments of all opponents, we will see that today's problem is one of strength and not one of justice or reason. A country cannot maintain its economic survival without sufficient space and necessary raw materials. Our relationship with North America has been maligned by unfounded rumors. We will not allow the United States to interfere in our internal affairs. Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia are all neighbors, and our trade relations with the Balkans are also good. We hope that the internal situation in Czechoslovakia can be rectified and that it will not once again adopt the dangerous policies of its former president, Beneš."</p>
<p>German-Japanese Relations Hitler expressed his views on German-Japanese relations, stating, "Today, this world is threatened by Bolshevism but marches blindly forward. Our relationship with Japan was decided after confirming the need to do everything possible to stop the tide of Bolshevism. I believe the Anti-Comintern Pact will become the crystallization of several countries because the ultimate goal of these countries is none other than to eliminate the Bolshevik devil, a threat to world peace and culture. Japan has shown many heroic examples in the past year (?) They are indeed fighting for culture on the other side of the world (?) Therefore, the collapse of Japan would not benefit any civilized nation in Europe or elsewhere in the world but would only lead to the victory of Bolshevism in the Far East (?)". Hitler's speech lasted two hours. After the speech, Goering thanked him for his achievements over the past six years. Finally, he shouted "Hail Victory," at which point all members sang the German national anthem and the Nazi Party anthem. Officials announced that Hitler's speech would be broadcast in a simplified form in English, French, and Italian.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, January 30th] Hitler's speech commemorating the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, long anticipated by all parties, will be delivered at 8:00 PM this evening. According to reliable sources, Hitler's speech will be the longest of his life. Sources with inside information say that the speech is nearly 200 typed pages, and even with wide spacing, it cannot be completed in less than two hours. The speech is extremely important. It is said that Hitler made final revisions to incorporate the latest news.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, January 30th] Before Hitler's speech to the German Reichstag this evening, German Interior Minister Frick declared that the country's four-year self-sufficiency plan would be implemented for another four years. General Goering has been unanimously re-elected as Speaker of the Reichstag.</p>
<p>International Commentary [Haitong News Agency, London, January 31st] Political circles here are quite satisfied with Hitler's speech to the Reichstag because recent rumors have been dispelled, and they are pleased that Hitler reaffirmed his guarantee that Germany has no territorial demands on Britain and France. However, they are somewhat dissatisfied that Hitler did not endorse Chamberlain's proposal at Buckingham Palace to hold consultations among all relevant countries. Most newspapers also argue that there will be a long period of peace. The Daily Mail expressed sympathy for Germany's demand for its former colonies, saying that Chamberlain should seize the opportunity to resolve the colonial issue because Britain is the guarantor of Germany's former colonies and should initiate this move for moral and obligatory reasons. It also stated that Hitler did not encourage Italy to reclaim its colonies. The News Chronicle reported that Britain should address the colonial issue as part of international relations and resolve it together with arms limitation. Barrett commented on Hitler's speech in the paper, saying that the German leader's speech should reassure those in democratic countries concerned about the international situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, January 31st] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said last night after listening to Hitler's speech on the radio that if Hitler's future actions are as moderate as his speech, war is not likely to break out immediately. The State Department is paying close attention to Hitler's statement that Germany will assist Mussolini no matter what.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, January 31st] Last night, all major newspapers here rushed to print extra editions, publishing the full text of Hitler's speech. They paid particular attention to Hitler's remarks on supporting Italy and whether the United States has the right to interfere in Germany's relations with South American Latin countries. Officials have not yet expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, January 31st] "Le Petit Parisien" published an article today criticizing Hitler's speech, saying, "Mr. Hitler is not necessarily seeking to create a crisis," but pointed out that Hitler's main goal is to "maintain the Rome-Berlin Axis." Other right-leaning newspapers also echoed, praising Hitler's statement, "I believe in lasting peace."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, January 31st] Hitler's speech to the Reichstag was broadcast throughout Italy. Millions of people, due to the tense relationship between France and Italy, expressed excitement upon hearing Hitler's message that Germany would provide assistance if Italy were attacked. According to government sources, Hitler's speech is a new proof of the stability of the Rome-Berlin political axis.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, January 30th] Communist Party Chairman Molotov will present the economic construction program of the Third "Five-Year Plan" at the Communist Party Congress to be held in March of this year. According to its principles, it is indeed striving to increase the production rate of military supplies. The plan will be implemented from 1938 to 1942. According to the report published in today's newspaper, the total industrial production of the Soviet Union can still be doubled by 80 percent within these five years. That is, in 1942, the production of production tools (machines, etc.) can be increased by two times and 35 percent. The gold industry and machine manufacturing industry can increase by two times and 55 percent compared with 1937. The military supplies industry is included, and all these industries will occupy a primary position in the future economic construction period. The chemical industry will increase by two times and 77 percent, the electrical industry by 6 percent, the coal production by one time and 81 percent, the steel production by one time and 52 and 56 percent, and the timber production by one time and 80 percent. The Soviet authorities hope that "strengthening workers' discipline" and implementing the Stakhanovite production method can achieve the above-mentioned goals. If so, by 1942, the annual production volume can be increased to 62 billion rubles.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, January 31st] According to sources here, Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a speech in Parliament on Tuesday, and Mussolini may also deliver a speech on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, January 31st] Today, the British House of Commons debated foreign policy events. Although the focus will be on Europe, it is expected that Members of Parliament concerned about Chinese affairs will urge the government to take more active action in the Far East, namely, to assist China on the one hand and safeguard British interests in China on the other. They are increasingly concerned about the Far East situation. In recent weeks, newspapers have often published reports on the Far East situation in prominent positions. The House of Commons China Committee has invited Dr. Chang Peng-chun to speak to the committee on the 7th of this month. Since arriving in London, Dr. Chang has been very active in both public lectures and private meetings. He had long talks with Lord Vansittart and Lord Cadogan and met with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax yesterday. During the day, he will meet with Lord Wood and Dominion Minister Inskip. Last week, Dr. Chang gave a lecture to a large audience at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and last night he went to Oxford University to speak to the Oxford Peace Society and the Chinese Association. This afternoon, he will attend a large gathering at a friend's house, where Ms. Utley and Mrs. Horden will also deliver speeches.

<h3 id="e22">Brief Commentary: British Imperial Airways Plane Attacked <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (January 31st), the British Imperial Airways plane, the "Delhi," was flying from Hong Kong when, while passing over the west of Weizhou Island, it was suddenly bombarded by Japanese warships. Details can be found on the Hong Kong news page of today's newspaper. This matter deserves our serious attention and should prompt all friendly nations to make a stern representation.</p>
<p>First, we must understand that since launching a full-scale invasion of China, the Japanese aggressors first blockaded our country's coast, cutting off our maritime transportation with friendly nations. They then attempted to blockade our country's skies, cutting off our air transportation with friendly nations. Although the × people have justified this illegal action as a special wartime situation, the important purpose is to cut off trade with China and undermine the interests of various countries in the Far East, in addition to military significance. Moreover, the Japanese aggressors have not formally declared war on our country and have not obtained the rights of a belligerent state. Therefore, the Japanese side has repeatedly attacked the merchant ships and civil aircraft of various countries, constantly creating terrorist incidents, which is not only a disregard for the rights of third countries but also a crazy provocation against third countries.</p>
<p>Second, since launching a full-scale invasion, and speaking only of the skies, the Japanese have successively attacked the China National Aviation Corporation's "Nanjing" and "Zhejiang" aircraft, jointly operated by China and the United States, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 15 aircraft, jointly operated by China and Germany, and the British Imperial Airways' "Dorado" aircraft. Because various countries only protested at the time and did not impose effective sanctions, the Japanese side has become increasingly bold and rampant. Now, if Britain, the United States, and other friendly nations tolerate this kind of ×× provocative ×× destructive behavior without thinking of closely uniting to deal with it effectively, then terrifying unfortunate events will inevitably become more frequent and severe.</p>
<p>Finally, we must especially point out that as long as the Japanese aggressors do not withdraw from China, the interests of friendly nations such as Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East will be unprotected. Therefore, people from all friendly nations should step up efforts to urge their governments to take active actions to aid China and restrain Japan. For example, in response to the Japanese atrocities of indiscriminately attacking aircraft, they can step up assistance to our country with aircraft and technical personnel, and strengthen our country's air force, so as to protect the safety of the skies.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Hitler's Wild Words <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, reported that Hitler delivered his "speech eagerly awaited by the world" in the Reichstag on the evening of the 30th. He declared that the current attitude of Fascist Germany is (1) to demand colonies; (2) if Italy participates in the war, Germany will absolutely assist Italy; (3) to resolutely support Japan's invasion of China. From this, it can be seen that what those "eagerly waiting" people got was not peace but a greater war threat!</p>
<p>Hitler's first demand, the so-called recovery of colonies, is in fact a demand to expand the war and newly divide the world. Because everyone knows that Germany's old colonies are mostly poor and disease-ridden areas, which absolutely cannot "remedy Germany's economy" nor can they supply "the food and raw materials needed by Germans." Hitler's so-called "recovering colonies can give seven million unemployed workers jobs" is purely a deception of the people. If one examines Hitler's "achievements" in the six years since he took power, and looks at the severe economic crisis and the poverty of the people in Germany today, it will be even clearer that the recent surge in anti-Hitler movements within Germany is by no means accidental. Hitler is now not satisfied with the plunder of Austria and Czechoslovakia, but is still using the slogan of recovering colonies to intensify the expansion of external wars, which is precisely a manifestation of shifting the internal crisis to compete with Britain and France for territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>Hitler's speech especially emphasized Germany's determination to assist Italian aggressors in fighting and to defend the invasion of China by Japanese fascist warlords, which further proves the fact that the international fascist aggression front and the democratic countries' peace front are in serious opposition. There are still a few people in our country who adhere to the superficial theory of pros and cons that seems to be right but is actually wrong, denying the fact that the aggression front and the peace front, which are truly combined due to interests, are in serious opposition. For example, yesterday, various newspapers published news from the German aggressors, and some people even interpreted it as Germany and the Soviet Union getting closer and Germany and Italy being about to disregard Japan. Although it may make people happy on the surface, in reality, this kind of argument is like a dream. This can be seen from Hitler's speech in support of Japan and Italy. We must eliminate emotions and fantasies when observing the facts. We are not afraid to face the ugly reality, and we must not only not cover it up but also urge people to be especially vigilant.</p>
<p>Fascist aggressors have grown stronger under the compromise policies of the British and French authorities, but their abnormal development has also increased their internal crises. Therefore, they will launch even more crazy external adventures, and their collusion - between Germany, Japan, and Italy - will inevitably become closer. They are still making wild threats, fabricating words to alienate peaceful countries, and slandering the Soviet Union. We must develop the peace front and severely打击them. We must also help the people's front within the aggressors to expand and jointly overthrow the strongholds of fascist aggressors.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Arbitrary ×× Imperial Airways Plane Flies Over Weizhou Island × Warship Actually Opens Fire Grounded Aria Suffers Danger Yesterday Morning Shortly After Taking Off From Hong Kong Fortunately the Pilot Quickly Evades Disaster Arriving Safely in Hanoi <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Imperial Airways' plane, the "Ge-li-li-ya", flew from Hong Kong to Penang. While passing over Weizhou Island, it was unexpectedly attacked by ×× with artillery fire. Fortunately, the pilot calmly dealt with the situation and evaded swiftly, thus avoiding the clutches of ×× and arriving safely in Hanoi. However, it was a close call. After the incident, the plane immediately sent a telegram to Hong Kong to report the details, which are as follows:</p>
<p>West of Weizhou Island Suddenly Attacked by × Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Imperial Airways' Hong Kong-Penang air route had two planes flying out yesterday. The route first landed in Hanoi, unloaded passengers and mail, and then transferred to Penang. The "Ge-li-li-ya" and "Dan-na-bo-na" planes flew out as scheduled yesterday morning. The "Ge-li-li-ya" took off at 7:00 AM, carrying two passengers, Mr. Deri and Mr. Mike-chuchen. The pilots were Wilson and San-wei-lu, as well as some mail. Mr. Deri would transfer to Sydney, Australia, after arriving in Penang from Hong Kong, while Mr. Mike would go directly to Penang. As for the "Dan-na-bo-na", it flew out at 7:30 AM, carrying two passengers, Mr. Mei-li-shi, the General Manager of Imperial Airways in the Far East, and Mr. Jian-shi-da, an employee of Imperial Airways in Australia, as well as a batch of mail. Shortly after the two planes flew out one after another, the Kai Tak Airport communications station suddenly received an urgent telegram from the "Ge-li-li-ya", stating that while flying over the west of Weizhou Island, they were suddenly fired upon by anti-aircraft guns from a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Weizhou Island. The telegram was very brief, and the outcome was unknown. The communications station immediately sent a telegram to inquire about the news, but did not receive a reply. At 11:25 AM, the communications station received a second telegram from the "Ge-li-li-ya" in Hanoi, stating that it and its sister plane, the "Dan-na-bo-na", had safely arrived in Hanoi, and that both people and planes were unharmed. The company was relieved after receiving the telegram.</p>
<p>Imperial Airways Attacked This is the Second Time</p>
<p>After receiving the news that the "Ge-li-li-ya" had been attacked by × artillery fire, the reporter immediately visited Mr. Morse, the director of Kai Tak Airport, to inquire about the incident. Mr. Morse declined to comment, only stating that it was a fact that the plane had been attacked, but fortunately it had not been hit and had now safely arrived in Hanoi. It is understood that this is the second time that a British Imperial Airways plane has been attacked by × warships. The first time occurred in March last year, when the "La-duo" plane was in danger. At that time, it was almost shot down by × warships, and shrapnel had penetrated the passenger cabin. Fortunately, the pilot remained calm and escaped disaster. Afterwards, the × authorities apologized to the British, claiming that they had mistaken it for a Chinese plane, leading to the accidental firing.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Preliminary Hearing for Shooting of British Detective Concluded Huang Shu's Theft Detailed Determination Examination Officer Describes the Situation of Detaining the Defendant Defendant Admits to Shooting British Detective to Escape <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The man Huang Shulun (also known as Li Xiuxi) was previously charged with the case, alleging that he had, late at night on December 2nd of last year, shot British police officer Ta-lu-te at No. 26 Des Voeux Road Central, above the Wing On Bank, with intent to harm, and privately possessed firearms and ammunition on the third floor of the Luk Kwok Hotel. This case was formally brought for preliminary hearing by the Central Magistracy Justice Yi Si at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, but because the testimony had not yet been fully recorded, it was brought up for further hearing at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. First, British police officer Hua-jia testified about receiving orders to search the Wing On Bank on the morning of December 3rd last year, and finding three bullet casings in the corridor. Next, Yu Liang, the room manager of the third floor of the Luk Kwok Hotel, testified that the defendant checked into the hotel last December, using the name Li Xiuxi, and stayed in room 317 on the third floor. On the night of the 2nd of that month, around 1:20 AM, Yu saw the defendant return to his room from outside. Then, British police officer Ao Yun testified about going to Queen Mary Hospital to retrieve the plaintiff Ta-lu-te's bloodstained clothes and filing the case at the police station. After that, Examination Officer Shi Shi testified, briefly stating that on the morning of December 3rd last year, he and many colleagues went to the Wing On Bank to search, and as a result, they found three bullet casings. Then, they went to room 317 of the Luk Kwok Hotel and knocked on the door. A woman opened the door (i.e., the dancer Chen Aili, who had previously been accused of colluding with Huang Shulun to privately possess firearms and ammunition). After entering, he saw a person lying in bed covered with a quilt. He pushed the person awake, and upon seeing the person, it was the defendant currently accused in court. Later, he found a handgun and three bullets in his bed at 6:25 AM. Then, he charged him with the case, stating that he was charged with three crimes: (1) harming the body of police officer Ta-lu-te, (2) attempted murder, and (3) privately possessing firearms. Shi Shi then explained the charges to the defendant in English. The defendant then replied, "I really had no intention of harming Ta-lu-te, and he is not my enemy. However, because my actions were being monitored and I could not escape, I was forced to fire the gun in hopes of escaping. The gun belongs to me and is not licensed, but this matter has nothing to do with Chen Aili." Next, Yu Xiongqu, the secretary of the Wing On Bank, testified, briefly stating, "I found a bullet hole on the edge of the door on the third floor that went straight through the wall, about two inches wide, and another bullet mark on the door frame." The recording of the testimony was completed at around 4:00 PM. The judge ruled to submit the case for detailed determination.</p>

<h3 id="e26">A Group of Poor and Helpless Compatriots The Life of Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Compassion</p>
<p>Poor and helpless compatriots are most likely to gain people's sympathy. As the ancient saying goes, "The heart of compassion is in everyone." The compassion of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong is very strong, as fully demonstrated in disaster relief work and saving refugees in war zones!</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers, a group of poor and helpless people, have a very difficult life. If they rent rickshaws directly from the rickshaw company, the rent is six dimes per car, and miscellaneous expenses are several yuan per day, which is a relatively small burden. As for those cars issued by the "pi tou" (middlemen), there is an additional layer of indirect exploitation. They must first pay the "pi tou" a tea fee of twenty-four yuan... Two people pull a car, and the "pi tou" earns forty-eight yuan per car for nothing... A deposit of twenty-two yuan, and a daily rent of six to six and a half dimes. They can temporarily live in the rickshaw hall. Such a heavy burden is really not easy to maintain. In today's developed transportation, the business of rickshaws is very limited. The daily income is at most one yuan (those who pull during working hours earn even less). In addition to the car rental and various miscellaneous expenses, two meals are not easy to maintain. Those with children are even more miserable!</p>
<p>There are more than 350 rickshaws in Kowloon, and about 800 to 900 rickshaw pullers. The rickshaws are issued by five companies: Yan Chengkun, Huang Xixiang, Gu Zi'an, Zhou Yaoting, and Maofeng. The companies and the "pi tou" and the rickshaw pullers are usually at peace with each other. However, the "pi tou" Yan ×× of ××× is particularly different. His exploitation of rickshaw pullers is particularly severe, and he constantly imposes unreasonable oppression. Yan ×× receives 15 rickshaws from the ××× company and pays the company a rent of five dimes per car per day, but he charges the rickshaw pullers eight dimes (two and a half to three dimes more than other companies and "pi tou"). He pockets several dimes for nothing, and he also exceptionally charges the rickshaw pullers a monthly lodging fee of two yuan, but in reality, he does not provide a place for the workers to live—because his rickshaw hall is very small. There are 33 workers in the entire hall. He collects the lodging fee but uses the rickshaw hall for business, selling porridge and herbal tea, etc. The workers have no choice. They pay the lodging fee but have no place to live, so they have to rent a place to live separately. Yan ×× forcefully extorts two yuan from each person every month for nothing!</p>
<p>Of course, the workers cannot bear this unreasonable ××. The difficult life forces the workers to make reasonable demands on Yan ××: like ordinary "pi tou", reduce the car rental to six or six and a half dimes, and at the same time, provide a place to live. However, Yan ×× ignores them and continues to oppress the workers. These rickshaw pullers were forced to repeatedly request a reasonable solution from the Chinese Civil Transportation Department several days ago in accordance with the law, but it has not been resolved yet. Yan ×× continues to increase the rent as usual, and also falsely accuses the workers, using the excuse to dismiss more than a dozen workers—confiscating the tea fee and deposit, and renting the rickshaws to other pullers—this kind of unreasonable oppression is beyond human common sense—the life of rickshaw pullers cannot be solved, and this kind of unreasonable oppression can no longer be tolerated. They decided to request a reasonable solution from the Chinese Civil Transportation Department again in accordance with the law, and also sent letters to the ××× Association and Mr. ××× to uphold justice, so that this incident can be resolved as soon as possible, so that these dozen rickshaw pullers and their families will not starve to death.</p>
<p>This group of rickshaw pullers, this group of poor and helpless compatriots, should receive the support and assistance of all sectors of society in upholding justice and showing compassion!</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were widespread rumors in Hong Kong that more than 270 overseas Chinese from Nanyang, who had returned to their country on the De Jili Shi Company's New Heimun ship from Yangon, were intercepted by two × submarines on the 14th of the month off the coast of Shantou, forced to stop sailing, and then a large number of × soldiers boarded the ship and detained the passengers. More than 200 overseas Chinese from Guangdong were killed, while more than 60 overseas Chinese from Fujian were fortunate to be unharmed. It was also said that a Westerner, the owner of the New Heimun, was electrocuted. Since the news spread, people in Hong Kong have been quite concerned. In recent days, people have visited the De Jili Shi Company, and all said that they had not received this news. Yesterday (30th) morning at 10:00, the company's Salis ship arrived in Hong Kong. According to a senior official of the ship, this ship also heard the rumor of the New Heimun's misfortune during the voyage. One day, when the ship arrived in Xiamen, the New Heimun also arrived. They inquired about each other and learned that the claim of the ship's misfortune was not true. Strangely, the New Heimun also received news during the voyage that this ship (Salis) had been in an accident. The circumstances of the reported accident were exactly the same. In fact, both ships were safe. The New Heimun is expected to return to Hong Kong within the week. As for the rumors circulating outside, they are groundless and no one knows where they came from.</p>

<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The situation of the first night of the joint performance by the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association at South China Middle School was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It was found that the most popular performances on the second night were the "Sanjiang Hao" by the Xuezhen Drama Society and the "Chinese Daughter" by the Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong compatriots. Last night was the third and final night, and the venue was still full. The "Spring Smile" performed by the Ren Dou Drama Society, the "After the Fall" performed in Mandarin by the China Bookstore Drama Society, and the "Seeking Survival from Death" performed by the Bow Drama Society were all very wonderful and moving. The famous film and drama artist Mr. Cai Chusheng also came to visit. Amid the audience's enthusiastic welcome, he took the stage to give a concise and meaningful speech, offering insightful perspectives on the prospects of the drama movement and offering encouragement to the association's spirit of unity and hard work. When the Hong Kong Youth Together Society sang the song "China Will Not Perish," because the melody, lyrics, and voices all touched the hearts of the audience, it was sung again at the audience's enthusiastic request. The sound of "China Will Not Perish!""China Will Not Perish!""China Will Not Perish!" was imprinted in the minds of every audience member. The ironclad facts prove the great role of drama and singing. In order to carry out collective self-education, the association plans to hold a review meeting of this performance at South China Middle School at 7:00 PM this Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Hong Kong Has Become the General Hub of Domestic and International Postal Transportation Foreign Mail Will No Longer Be Transferred Through Shanghai to Prevent × Inspection Central China and North China Will Be Transferred Through Fujian to the Southwest, and Shantou and Vietnam <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Mail from overseas countries to various parts of North and Central China was mostly transshipped through Shanghai before the war. However, since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai has been occupied by × forces, and the mailing of mail has been greatly hindered. Moreover, × people have set up so-called "inspectors" in Shanghai, and all incoming and outgoing mail is subject to illegal inspection. Therefore, mailing letters from abroad to China via Shanghai is not only delayed, but also subject to accidental loss due to the × people's abuse of inspection. The General Directorate of Posts of the Ministry of Communications of China recognized that this had to be improved. Therefore, it was decided that all mail between China and foreign countries would no longer be transshipped through Shanghai, but would be concentrated in Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong has now become the general hub of domestic and international postal transportation. All mail from overseas to China will be transshipped through Hong Kong. As for the entry points, they have also been designated. Mail to North and Central China will enter through Fuzhou, Fujian Province, and will be attributed to Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces. Mail to the Southwest will be entered through Shantou and Annam (Vietnam) and Burma. This method has recently been notified by the General Directorate of Posts to the postal administrations of various countries for compliance. After implementation, all domestic and foreign postal transportation will not pass through Shanghai, which will not only avoid × inspection, but also eliminate any obstacles in the future.

<p>The Hong Kong Legislative Council will hold a meeting at 2:30 PM this Thursday afternoon. The most important item on the agenda is the first reading by Attorney General Yan Libo of the 1938 Amendment to the Ordinance on Preventing the Eviction of Tenants. If this case is passed, the right of re-occupation enjoyed by landlords under common law will be suspended during the validity of the original ordinance. Before the tenant moves out, if the landlord implements re-occupation or intends to re-occupy, the tenant may sue for compensation. According to the amended rules, the court is authorized to decide on rent disputes in order to seek fairness in the rent amount. In addition, before a judge or clerk issues a seizure warrant in accordance with the 1883 Rent Arrears Seizure Ordinance, the applicant must provide evidence to prove that the tenant refuses to pay rent or that the rent increase is excessive. According to this new ordinance, landlords may not arbitrarily force eviction or arbitrarily raise rents, and cunning landlords who refuse to collect rent on purpose, claiming that the tenant owes rent, and request the court to issue a seizure warrant to take back the building, will not be able to sell their tricks. The other items on the agenda are: (1) Unofficial member Pu Lejue Shen questions whether the Hong Kong government has made a statement on the financial situation of Tung Wah Hospital and its affiliated hospitals; (2) Secretary of Administration requests the passage of the Financial Meeting Report No. 11 of December 22, 1938; (3) Attorney General Yan Libo requests the passage of the regulations made by the Attorney General on the 12th of this month in accordance with Article 32 of the Higher Court Ordinance, Ordinance No. 3 of 1873; (4) Attorney General Yan Libo requests: (1) First reading of (A) the Amendment to the 1935 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, (B) the repeal of the 1934 Governor's Office and Hong Kong District Expansion Plan Ordinance, and the allocation of the surplus amount under the account set up in the Finance Department in accordance with Article 4 of the Ordinance to general revenue, (C) the aforementioned Amendment to the 1938 Ordinance on Preventing the Eviction of Tenants, (D) the Amendment to the 1889 Evidence Ordinance, (E) the Amendment to Article 45 of the 1938 Amended Rules of the 1865 Ordinance on Assaulting Others; (2) Second and Third readings of (A) the Further Amendment to the 1915 Asian Immigration Ordinance, (B) the Amendment to the 1899 Criminal Procedure Ordinance.</p>

After the fall of Guangzhou, the East River District Team traveled to various places in the west and north of the two rivers, walking to the Dongjiang River, Heyuan, Huiyang, and Boluo areas to participate in political training for local civil defense groups and guerrilla teams, mobilize the people, and provide military service and rescue work. Now, in order to promote various tasks, the team has specially dispatched Captain Tan Jiaju and team members Chen Qiaozhen and Li Jiazhen to Hong Kong to raise donations and medicines. Mr. Tan and others have been contacting various parties in recent days and have made considerable progress. It is hoped that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will actively sponsor the team.</p>

<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Daytime Exhibition in England Promotes Chinese History and Art</p>
<p>The exhibition of famous paintings from various dynasties of our country, which are to be transported to London, was pre-exhibited yesterday (30th) by the "Hong Kong Art Research Association" in the conference room of the South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the place was too small, only twenty-seven pieces were exhibited. Although the quantity is said to be small, the quality is extremely rich. Only the old saying "a feast for the eyes, a beauty that surpasses all" can describe this painting exhibition.</p>
<p>Upon entering, there is the well-known large ink painting "Entering Cloud Dragon" by Chen Suoweng of the Song Dynasty. The ink is used to create clouds, which are changing and realistic, and extremely lovely. The ink dragon, which "sees its head but not its tail," is also very agile, and it is indeed a flawless masterpiece.</p>
<p>The four large figure sketches of ploughing, weeding, gathering firewood, and fishing by Zhan Zidu of the Sui Dynasty are skillfully executed, and the lines are vigorous. "Autumn Mountain Gathering Firewood" and "Standing Fishing" are even more charming.</p>
<p>In the center is a green pavilion landscape "Datong Hall" by Li Sixun of the Tang Dynasty. The picture is particularly large, with carved beams and painted rafters, winding railings and small pavilions, and the high pavilions of the main hall are detailed but not rigid. The author's魄力 is truly not small.</p>
<p>Li also has a "Autumn Mountain Journey Map", also a green landscape, depicting more than thirty horses and more than twenty people. Each horse and each person has a different posture—on the rugged mountain path, some are leading horses, some are watering horses, and some are riding horses over small bridges. In the middle of the mountain, there is a small tea pavilion, where eight or nine old wild mountain people are drinking tea, each with a different expression, which is very interesting. The horses resting outside the pavilion are either lying down or standing. Without a "spirit-transmitting brush," such a good picture could not be written. Su Hanchen—a man of the Five Dynasties—painted "Dragon Girl Picture," which is resplendent and meticulously rich.</p>
<p>The landscape painting of the Song Dynasty Mi Fu, "Imperial City in the Clouds, Ten Thousand Homes with Spring Trees in the Rain," can be said to be the most outstanding work in the entire exhibition. Mi Fu's landscape is a unique school, with皴法, dots, tree methods... all having unique styles. The painting of stones is even more extraordinary. It is indeed "uncommon." Although the landscapes of the Tang Dynasty are beautiful, they lack the majestic vigor of the Song Dynasty landscapes and the清逸 of the Yuan Dynasty landscapes. That's why I say that Mi Fu's landscape and Xia Gui's landscape of the Song Dynasty, Huang Gongwang's "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" of the Yuan Dynasty, and Wu Zhen's "Four Seasons Picture" landscape of the Yuan Dynasty are better by two筹.</p>
<p>Li Guizhen's "Five Ethics Picture" of the Song Dynasty has the imperial inscription of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, the originator of calligraphy and painting. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty was a painter, and his appreciation of works must be more valuable than the imperial inscriptions of other emperors. In the picture, a pair of桐花風 is very meticulous and agile.</p>
<p>Many modern people write peacocks with meticulousness and gorgeousness, but unfortunately, nineteen out of ten lose their rigidity. Here, there is a flower and bird painting by Diao Guangyin of the Tang Dynasty, depicting a pair of peacocks, lively and eager to live, which are rare works.</p>
<p>There are many other works such as album pages and horizontal scrolls. Based on the reporter's personal memory, "hanging one and missing ten thousand" is inevitable. In short, from these twenty-odd works, one can already see the greatness of ancient Chinese art.</p>
<p>Art is a sharp weapon to connect human sympathy. Let our great ancient art go abroad so that friendly countries can have a more accurate understanding of us!</p>
<h3 id="e37">Old Nickel Coins to be Abolished After the Lunar New Year; Authorities Hope Merchants Will Exchange as Much as Possible Before the End of the Year <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have issued new nickel coins in the denominations of one亳 and five仙 in order to unify auxiliary coins and prevent criminals from counterfeiting and disrupting finance. The issuance of the new nickel coins is about to reach one year. Due to various reasons, the old coins have not yet been fully recovered. Mr. 布力氏, the Director of Temple Affairs, told reporters yesterday that the authorities originally planned to announce a deadline for the withdrawal of old coins at the end of the lunar year. Within a certain period after the announcement, they would be declared invalid and no longer in circulation. However, because the year-end is approaching, the market needs more auxiliary coins in circulation. If an announcement is issued at this time, citizens will rush to exchange them, which may cause some disturbance to order. It has now been decided to issue the announcement a few days after the New Year. It is hoped that merchants will exchange as much as possible within this year so that the government's future withdrawal of old coins will be easier to handle. The first batch of new coins issued for circulation in the market, including one亳 and five仙 denominations, totaled about three million yuan. The second batch issued also totaled about three million yuan. Currently, the total in circulation in the market is six million yuan, and the Treasury Department has a large number of new coins in stock, which are prepared to be fully issued within the lunar year.</p>

<h3 id="e38">After the Fall of Qingdao, Foreign Businesses Greatly Affected; Import and Export Trade Has Virtually Ceased; Jiaodong Area Constantly Attacked by Us <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] According to the North China Daily News, Qingdao, an important port in Shandong Province, is a beautiful summer resort, and in addition to being a year-round ice-free naval base, superior to Yantai and Dalian, it is also an export port for Shandong products such as tobacco, silk, cotton, and coal. In terms of waterways, it is very close to Shanghai, and by land, the Jiaoji Railway connects the Longhai and Beining Railways, connecting prosperous areas of North-South products. Before the outbreak of the current war, there were less than 1,500 Japanese people in Qingdao. Now, Japanese merchants from Japan and Northeast China have poured in, reaching 25,000 people. Foreign trade in Qingdao is now being ostracized due to the arbitrary suppression by the Japanese side. Foreign importers are restricted in exchange rates and shipping, and are forced to stop doing business. This restriction is implemented by the Japanese Army and Navy Headquarters and is unreasonably self-evident. Foreign importers who had transactions with large and small commercial firms in our country before the war are now greatly affected, and therefore, many of these commercial firms have closed down or have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese side. Once it falls into the hands of the Japanese, foreign raw materials are no longer needed. Therefore, foreign importers have to close their Qingdao offices. Foreign ships sailing in the sea and along the coast are also subject to strict restrictions and cannot freely use the docks, but can only anchor on the sea. However, ships owned by the Japanese can freely use all dock facilities and断驳 transport. Although the驳 transport fee is carried out by Japanese ships, their service is extremely unreliable. Therefore, ships are subject to various difficulties after sailing to Qingdao and suffer completely unnecessary losses. The import and export trade of foreign firms has virtually ceased. Only foreign tobacco is still operating, and the impact on it is not as great as on ordinary foreign firms. The Japanese are麻醉ing the daily life of the Chinese people, which is evident everywhere, such as the five-color flag and the Japanese flag hanging crisscross, and photos of the Japanese army and friendly traitors. Every few days, the Japanese authorities order the puppet maintenance association to致愚the people and teach them to shout slogans. Recently, there was a so-called anti-communist parade, carrying absurd books, guided by a band, and setting off firecrackers along the way, which was extremely ugly. Some members of the anti-communist association, some White Russians, participated in the parade. These White Russians were organized into an anti-communist association by the Japanese side, and everything they said and did followed their主仑, that is, the Japanese military authorities. The Japanese military authorities even ordered White Russian children not to enter foreign schools in Qingdao, such as British schools, because the Japanese side said that the training and education in these schools did not conform to the ideals of the Japanese side. Therefore, all White Russian children returned to White Russian schools. All public conveniences and services such as telephone, electricity, power,自水, and public buses are completely in the hands of the Japanese. All dock operations such as驳 transport are monopolized by the Japanese under the protection of the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps. Industries, flour mills, iron mines, and iron factories are all taken over by capitalists of large Japanese firms. It is undoubtedly certain that a small number of factories still operated by Chinese people will soon be taken over by the Japanese. In short, every kind of profitable trade in Shandong has either been taken over by the Japanese or is in the process of being taken over, and foreign businesses,无论如何, will be forced to be driven out. Coastal shipping of foreign companies is decreasing, and because there are few export goods, very few sea ships sail to Qingdao. However, Japanese ships are sailing frequently, and various Japanese goods are continuously输人, and most of them藉口 military supplies without paying tariffs, so foreign firms cannot compete with them. All properties of our government and administrative personnel have been confiscated as properties of the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps. Wealthy residents have all fled to other places. As the number of Japanese people has increased, Japanese tea rooms, hotels, liquor stores, and department stores have also opened one after another. Large buildings and schools that once belonged to Chinese people are now stationed by the Japanese army. There are few conflicts between foreigners and the Japanese army because Qingdao has no concession, so the Japanese army is not very tense about the feelings of foreigners. The Jiaoji Railway connecting Qingdao and Jinan is still the target of constant attacks by our guerrillas. These guerrillas, it is said, are commanded by the former Qingdao mayor Shen Honglie. Every night, they attack the railway line, and any negligence by the Japanese army will cause the train to derail. In addition, along the coast of Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, several Japanese soldiers are inevitably ambushed and killed or injured by guerrillas every day. In short, Qingdao is of great value, both militarily and economically, and the Japanese army will not be willing to give it up once they get it.</p>

<p>— Shuai Liangcang</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would be said that without a strong northerly wind, it would take a "天拋天" (Note 2) to arrive. I had long admired the scenery of Hengyang, so on the afternoon of the fourth day, when the ship arrived at Zhuting, I landed and transferred to the Yuehan train first. After staying for a few days, I was able to make a tour of Hengyang, the leading big city in Hunan Province. My impressions are described below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the City—The city of Hengyang is divided into inner and outer cities. According to the county chronicles, "The inner city is two丈 five尺 high, one丈 six尺 thick, and has a circumference of one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight尺. The outer city is more than one丈 high. The city walls still exist today. There are seven gates in the city, namely Binri in the east, also called Ran. Hui in the south. Xi'an in the west. Dan in the north. Gejiang in the southeast, also called Tie. Xiaoxiang in the northeast. And Wanghu in the northwest. The scale of the roads and the prosperity of the businesses within the city are not inferior to the central area of Nanchang. Especially Nanzheng Street and Xizheng Street are the city's最. Recently, due to the opening of the Xiang-Gui Railway, the number of passengers has been increasing day by day, and inns have sprung up in the通街巷, like bamboo shoots after the rain. But when I arrived in Hengyang and got off the train, I ran into more than a dozen inns after entering the city before I finally found a room in the Xiang-Gui Restaurant near the Silver Flower Cinema. Most of the inns in Hengyang are called restaurants. The best-equipped is the Guangdong Restaurant.</p>
<p>Turning from Xizheng Street to the crossroads of Nanzheng Street, a transparent electric light illuminates the advertisement for "Beautiful Girl Hairdressing." It turns out that there are many barber shops in that area. Generally, the barbers are beautiful girls of eighteen or nineteen. Their soft hands are slender, and the sound of scissors is铮铮. It attracts young men in suits. Whenever they pass by the door, they naturally raise their hands and touch their heads, silently asking themselves, "Has it grown yet?"</p>
<p>As the sun sets and the lights come on, the two giant mouths in front of Silver Flower and Shengping Cinema devour crowds of young men and women, and then slowly spit them out after two or three hours. It turns out that they are showing anti-war movies. When they come out, each young man's face is露出ing a state of excitement and indignation. Hengyang is roaring.</p>
<p>Scenery Points—Hengyang is named because it is located on the yang side of Heng Mountain. According to the book, the peaks of Nan Yue span the two borders of Changsha and Hengyang, with Huiyan at the head and麓 at the foot. With a long history, there are naturally many scenic spots. The county has eight scenic spots:</p>
<p>(1) Yan Peak in Misty Rain, outside the Huiyan Gate, with the Misty Rain Pool below.</p>
<p>(2) Flower Medicine Spring Creek, about three 里 east of the west bus station.</p>
<p>(3) East Isle Peach Waves, about three 里 south of the east bus station. There is the Chuanshan Temple on the isle, built by Peng Yulin of the Qing Dynasty to commemorate Wang Chuanshan.</p>
<p>(4) Prison Pavilion Snow, outside the west斗.</p>
<p>(5) Stone Drum Landscape, outside the north gate, with Zhu 菴's inscription saying "A good place in the郡."</p>
<p>(6) Zhu Ling Back Cave, behind Stone Drum Mountain, where Dong Fengxian of the Tang Dynasty practiced the Hua Dan method.</p>
<p>(7) Green Grass Fisherman's Home, outside the north gate. Whenever the setting sun is on the mountain and the fishing boats sing in the evening, it is truly a beautiful景.</p>
<p>(8) West Lake Lotus, outside the small west gate, with the Ai Lian Pavilion, where Zhou Dunyi of the Song Dynasty studied.</p>
<p>A Beautiful Woman's Soul Leaving Her Body—Almost everyone who has read the Taiping Guangji knows about the story of a beautiful woman's soul leaving her body. The story goes like this: "During the Tang Dynasty, there was a man named Zhang 　, who lived in Heng 　. He promised his beloved daughter, Qian Niang, to his nephew Yu Zhou. But in the middle, there was someone who expressed affection for her字. Qian heard郁 and was depressed. Zhou was慨. He claimed to be going to the capital and bought a boat and left suddenly. He could not sleep on the boat at night. Qian Niang suddenly came to the cabin. After meeting, they decided to elope. They lived in Sichuan for five years and had two sons. Later, they returned to Hengzhou. Zhou携 his wife and children to Zhang to apologize. He was surprised to find that Qian Niang had not left闽阁 and was lying ill in bed. When the two women met, they immediately became one."</p>
<p>During my stay in Xiang-Gui, I often chatted with the tea博士 after dinner and tea. According to the博士, it was indeed a fact. Now, the Jiudu Shop outside the north gate is the place where the soul met. Three county lives.</p>
<p>After staying in Hengyang for a few days, the weather suddenly turned cold. I knew that this was the northerly wind weather. Sure enough, one afternoon, the sails of my companion's ship appeared one by one at the Qingcao Bridge under the Stone Drum Pillar. So, I landed the next day and hired porters and vehicles,winding地绕着迴雁峯　to the Hengyang West Station of the Xiang-Gui Railway. (There are now buses from the city to the station, with a fare of two角 per person.) At that time, the road was only open to the whole county. We had decided to come to Gui, so we temporarily made the terminal our destination. We set off at six o'clock in the evening, and after listening to the rumbling of the train all night, when the east gradually turned white, we had passed Dong'an and slowly said goodbye to Hunan. It turned out that the end of the road in Hunan was Miaotou Station, and the beginning of Guangxi was Huangsha River. The whole road was full of stone mountains and forests, which were extremely steep, which was enough to make people feel refreshed. The mountains and rivers of Guilin are said to be the best in the world, which is indeed true.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Time flies like a white horse passing a crack, and the Spring Festival is approaching. The inaugural Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city football match is scheduled to take place when spring returns and flowers blossom. Counting down the days, the auspicious date is near, and football fans are secretly delighted.</p>
<p>Currently, the Football Association is ramping up preparations, putting in a great deal of effort. On one hand, they are rushing to select the Hong Kong team representatives in the near future to hold practice matches. On the other hand, they are planning advance ticket sales, following the past practice of the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-city match, distributing them to various affiliated associations and major companies for advance sales.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Football Association received a letter from the Philippines stating that the team and entourage are scheduled to depart on the 14th of this month and arrive in Hong Kong on the 16th.</p>
<p>The level of football skill in the Philippines before the war was quite low. However, physical strength is the only strength of football players there.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Shanghai's famous player Poselli (French forward) in the Philippines before the war, he has made many contributions to the local football scene, thereby gradually improving the skill level of various teams.</p>
<p>This time, the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong is sure to give the island's fans a fresh perspective.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Huang Jiliang, who has been a leader in the sports world for many years, returned from Java a month ago and has rarely been active in the sports community. He was originally an expert in football, basketball, and swimming. In recent years, he has devoted himself to business, and has gradually given them up. Yesterday, a reporter met him at the South China Billiards Room. He said that playing basketball is still interesting, but he will not participate in the league. He can play in friendly matches and charity matches. Therefore, the reporter introduced him to join the Star Team and has asked Brother Chizi to notify Brother Sang Yu to register his name. When the Washington team comes to Hong Kong to compete, perhaps we can see his good skills again. (Tai Sui)</p>

<p>This is a work by Laurel and Hardy from several years ago. Now, a new copy has been re-released. Among all of Laurel and Hardy's works, this one is slightly weaker. The film is not very long, and the content is not very rich. In the film, Hardy is frustrated and heartbroken, so he enlists in the army and is sent to Africa. During a Saharan march, the two get lost but end up saving a besieged city from the natives. Laurel and Hardy maintain their consistent style, and the jokes are still enough to make the audience laugh.</p>
<p>Finally... Death Ray Explosion Machine</p>
<p>Arrest of Bulldog Drummond</p>
<p>There have been several films about the detective Bulldog Drummond before, but each has an independent story. In this film, "Death Ray Explosion Machine," apart from HE Warner replacing John Barrymore, the other actors have not changed much. Among all the Bulldog Drummond detective films, this one has a more tortuous and thrilling story. The story depicts Drummond, on the eve of his wedding, again having to deal with the murder of his friend, a professor who is an inventor and is working on the invention of a death ray explosion machine. Drummond is eager to avenge his friend and, because it concerns national defense, he strives to track down the enemy, going through many dangers and eventually bringing the villains to justice.</p>
<p>The whole film is tense and lively. John Howard plays the detective and acts vigorously. The acting skills of the other actors are also unique.</p>
<p>Peace... The Story of a Young Widow</p>
<p>That Certain Woman</p>
<p>This is a work in which Bette Davis and Henry Fonda collaborate again after "That Certain Woman." This is the second time this film has been released in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The story tells of a sad marriage. Bette plays a working widow who falls in love with a man, but because the man's father strongly opposes it, the marriage does not take place. However, she is unfortunately pregnant and soon gives birth to a child. Later, the man marries another woman in Paris. Then, that woman injures her leg and becomes disabled. At the same time, out of sympathy for her husband and the child he had with the widow, she sacrifices her love and allows them to reunite.</p>
<p>The tragic atmosphere of the whole film is quite strong, and several climaxes are very effective in manipulating the audience's emotions. Bette Davis plays a widow who is heavily oppressed by the social environment, giving a deep and moving performance. Henry Fonda is also very competent.</p>
<p>Oriental... Mother and Son's True Feelings</p>
<p>Of Human Hearts</p>
<p>This describes the tragedy of a family. The father is a missionary who sacrifices everything for religion, but his son opposes this work, thinking that being a doctor is more practical than being a pastor. So, after a fierce argument, the son leaves home to study medicine. Later, the old father dies, and the mother sacrifices everything to raise education funds for her son. By the time he finishes his studies, the civil war has broken out. Rescue work makes him feel very interested. Because he felt that the family had left him with a bad influence, he forgot his old mother. It was not until someone criticized him that he felt ashamed and returned to his mother's arms.</p>
<p>The tragic components of the whole film are very strong. At the same time, although this film is not a war film, the war and rescue scenes are quite impressive. Several of the main actors seem a little unfamiliar to us, but their performances do not disappoint.</p>
<p>Great China... Skillful Girl's Singing</p>
<p>Mad About Music</p>
<p>This is a very moving tragicomedy. Because some places need to be made into a comedy, they inevitably seem a little weak. Of course, this does not affect the film itself. The director's handling is quite tight, and every development can capture the humor of the comedy.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin's performance is extremely beautiful. Not only are the several songs extremely pleasant to listen to, but her expressions are also excellent. Several supporting roles are also very perfect.</p>
<p>New World... Women's World</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>The plot describes the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. This apartment contains all kinds of people. They have their own professions, but they are extremely complicated. Among them are female students, female reporters, female salespeople, singers, dancers... etc. All the working women in the city are included here. The women are buzzing around, and they each have their own experiences. It is no exaggeration to say that she is a microcosm of women in the city. However, the progress of the plot of the whole play seems very lax and forced because there is no male foil, which cannot arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only depict the ordinary private lives of ordinary women, such as applying powder and arguing. However, it has never been able to write about the broad descriptions of women. This is really the only reason for the film's failure. In the end, the women all realized what was going on and united to go to the front line because the apartment was bombed. This also seems unnatural and formulaic. However, having said that, we must also forgive the writers and directors. It is also a very difficult thing to perform a play with all women.</p>
<p>Central... Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>Audiences who have seen the previous episode will always remember that at the end, Zhou Zhicheng still stole a pair of Golden Chrysanthemums. The sequel starts with this incident and continues until the Golden Chrysanthemums are returned. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is also very lax. However, there are still many places in the middle that can win the tears of some stupid audiences, such as the persecution and imprisonment of Kuang Shanxiao and Xiao Yanfei's prison visits. The consistent style of folk tales cannot be avoided. We don't need to watch it to guess the plot of the film. Sure enough, the move is not crafted. Cao Tongwen is not suitable for acting in this type of film. The set photography is still passable in South China, but Mu Yin's is a failure.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Looking Back and Ahead <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 【Lai Duanfu】</p>
<p>The editor of this column, Mr. Chen Yipan, said that my opinions on matters are always impartial, and he invited me to write weekly sports commentaries. Although I am busy, I dare not disobey my old friend's wishes. Therefore, I have decided to write "Looking Back and Ahead" every Wednesday.</p>
<p>After South China Southern defeated Eastern with a score of 2-1, those who hoped that the South China team would definitely win the championship all looked worried. This is because South China Southern has already lost one more point than the Navy in the league. However, I remain optimistic, because of South China Southern’s remaining seven games, only the Navy poses a significant threat. The Navy still faces many challenges, such as South China Southern, Eastern, South China China, and Middlesex, whom they have not yet met again. Once South China Southern regains its strength, they will likely sweep all before them. The Navy lacks scoring talent, and I fear they will not be able to win all six of their remaining games.</p>
<p>Last weekend, all the football teams with championship hopes seemed to encounter their nemesis. Not only did South China Southern suffer a setback, but according to news reports, the Shanghai Eastern team was defeated by the Western Police, ending their championship hopes. In the English First Division professional football league, the "Derby" team, which had the strongest championship hopes, was also defeated 3-0 by the mediocre "Stoke" team, losing one more point than the "Ipswich Town" team, which is currently in second place. Coincidentally, the situation is the same far and wide. South China Southern can take some comfort from this.</p>
<p>This week's Hong Kong football matches are at a crucial juncture for both the Special Silver Shield and the league. South China Southern's rematch against Kowloon Club and South China China's rematch against Eastern in the First Division Special Silver Shield will undoubtedly be the most attention-grabbing scenes on Saturday and Sunday. At the same time, South China's match against the Five Camps Artillery in the Second Division league at the Garrison Ground on Saturday is also a crucial scene in the Second Division. Currently, South China Club, Middlesex, Garrison Artillery, and Scots are considered the four strongest teams in the Second Division, with the others having lost hope of winning the championship. The situation of the four strongest teams is as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name  Games Played  Wins  Draws  Losses  Goals For  Goals Against  Points</p>
<p>South China Club  16  13  2  1  46  19  28</p>
<p>Five Camps Artillery 15  11  3  1  45  18  25</p>
<p>Middlesex  16  12  1  3  70  26  25</p>
<p>Scots  16  12  1  3  5  16  25</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, if South China wins this weekend, they will be five points ahead of the other three teams, and their championship will be secure. If they unfortunately lose, they will face a great threat from the Artillery, because although they will still be in first place on the surface, they will have actually lost one more point than the Artillery. Examining the South China team in the Third Division, although they can still compete for second place, they have lost hope of winning the championship. I hope the South China coach will prioritize the Second Division team and continue to use Li Enpei, the center forward from the Third Division, as the center forward for the Second Division team this weekend. From my observation, this player will definitely become a good player in the First Division in the future.</p>
<p>In the rematch of the Special Silver Shield, South China Southern will play Kowloon Club at Jiashan. Without home advantage, Kowloon Club is not a strong team, and South China will likely win. However, one should not be careless in everything. If Li Tiansheng's foot injury has not healed by then, Li Guowei should still be used as the left inside forward, and Cong Yanzan should replace Guowei in the midfield line. It would be best to invite Li Huitang to assist in the forward line. This will not only greatly increase the attacking power but also allow the "ball freak" to practice his shooting skills in preparation for the inter-port matches. Mr. Li has always been concerned about his mother club, sharing its joys and sorrows, and I believe he will definitely come if invited. In South China China's rematch against Eastern, both teams are Chinese teams, and it is gratifying regardless of who wins. However, both teams should show their full strength during the match and demonstrate true sportsmanship. If Zhang Manrong's foot injury has healed, it seems appropriate to replace Li Shuoyou with him. What we hope for even more is that all misunderstandings should be dispelled during the match, and we do not want to see any recurrence of the incidents from the first match. If Lin Depu's injury has not healed, then the best formation for South China China would be as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian</p>
<p>Liu Mao Liu Weipei</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong You Huaxing Liang Baiwei</p>
<p>Zhang Manrong Liu Songsheng Chen Dehui Li Enliang Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>It is said that this year's Hong Kong sports have reached the highest level in Hong Kong's history, mainly because of the gathering of talents. I say, not necessarily. However, the football goalkeepers have truly become unprecedentedly good. There are famous Chinese goalkeepers gathered in Hong Kong, including Bao Jiaping, Tan Junqian, Zhang Rongcai, Huang Jiliang, Zhou Xianyan, and Liu Xianhan, Zhu Zhaoheng, and Li Guoqi, who have risen rapidly. There are also Xu Heng, Chen Qisong, Xiao Dianlian, Yi Zanbang, and Chen Xipei, who were once well-known. There is also Zhang Manrong, who is famous in the small-field football world. If these people were organized, they could form a purely goalkeeper football team, and their strength would not be weak. There is also an unprecedentedly happy event, which is that we reporters and weak scholars can also actively research the path of sports and actually establish a well-organized sports special committee.</p>
<p>The students' tennis skills on the isolated island have improved rapidly, and they can actually form a team to compete in Hong Kong, which is also a gratifying thing. Yesterday, I met a famous tennis player who said that two players on the team have very good skills. Tang Baodao recently defeated Jiang Daozhang, a veteran who has represented China in the Davis Cup, 6-3 in practice. Judging from this, the team seems to have a good chance of winning or drawing in their matches against the University of Hong Kong and South China Club. I very much hope that one or two geniuses like Xu Chengji can emerge from this.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e59">About Mr. Zhu Peixian <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Chunfeng</p>
<p>Unintentionally, yesterday (28th) I saw an article signed "Peixian" in the editorial column of a certain newspaper in Hong Kong, titled "Hesitation and Rumors." Because I know that Mr. Zhu has never liked to talk about politics, let alone write political commentary, and he is a very enthusiastic supporter of the War of Resistance, he would never make such ignorant and absurd remarks as "so-called long-term pain is worse than short-term pain, the people can endure temporary sacrifices in exchange for long-term peace. Unexpectedly, the government has been defeated but does not admit defeat, can make peace but does not talk about peace, not only does not talk about peace, but also oppresses the leaders who advocate peace..." Therefore, there must be some mystery here. This "Peixian" is definitely not Zhu Peixian, who is currently the director of Chinese Literature at Southwest Associated University in Yunnan, but must be a villain fabricating or impersonating. There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Today, in this unprecedented great and transformative era, those who were once patriotic gentlemen can suddenly turn into great villains who steal national power and lose their personality. People and ghosts are changing rapidly. But there are indeed some steadfast, fearless, unwavering, and unchangeable virtuous people, and Mr. Peixian is one of them. Therefore, it is definitely necessary to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Peixian is the courtesy name of Mr. Zhu Ziqing. Decades ago, he became famous in the literary world with his book "Back View." He is good at writing essays, and his prose is the most beautiful. Since parting ways in the ancient city, I have never seen his works again. Some time ago, I read an article by him in "Today's Commentary" titled "New Language," which was the first time I had read his writing since the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>He is probably a well-known teacher among young students. His prose often appears in textbooks. But he is also a senior and practical mentor. I remember that when the students in the ancient city were roaring four years ago, he fulfilled his guiding role. That year, the Suiyuan situation was urgent, and General Fu Zuoyi's great victory at Bailingmiao laid the foundation for the overall situation in the Northwest. Mr. Zhu represented Tsinghua University to comfort the Suiyuan soldiers at the front. In his report after returning from consoling the troops, his speech was full of fighting passion and national fervor. It made people clearly realize that although he is a courteous, elegant, and talented gentleman, he is also a vivid and powerful national warrior on the other hand.</p>
<p>I clearly remember that once at a meeting of the Tsinghua Chinese Literature Society, Mr. Liu Wendian, Mr. Wen Yiduo, and others talked about their experiences of inspecting the Northwest. They all had a burning flame of bright hope and foresaw that the Chinese nation's great anti-aggression struggle was about to begin. Mr. Wen said with a smile, "Look, the Chinese people's weapons are all stored in the Northwest! The Sino-Japanese war will break out soon." At that time, Mr. Zhu, Mr. Liu, and others felt satisfied and delighted that their footprints had been fortunate enough to reach Daqingshan before the great struggle.</p>
<p>In June of the year before last, Tsinghua University was still in a quiet atmosphere, continuing to study. I wanted to try to select or audit Mr. Zhu's classes, such as Du Shi, Song Poetry, and prose composition, but I could not do so because of scheduling conflicts. In early July, Mr. Zhu was still carefully planning my future after graduation. He repeatedly asked whether I would go to a certain middle school in Tianjin that he recommended, or to a certain school in Xiamen. But before I could answer, the ancient city had fallen into enemy hands. When I fled to Xiamen in a hurry, I later received a letter from him, knowing that he had also safely escaped from the occupied ancient city to Changsha. Before the Faculty of Arts of the Associated University moved to Kunming, I received a letter from him in Mengzi, saying that the location of the Associated University in Mengzi was very good and expressing reluctance about the future move to Kunming. He is indeed a poet with a beautiful mind, and also a good teacher who loves young people. When the Associated University moved from Changsha to Yunnan, Mr. Zhu was also a persevering and fearless walker who traveled thousands of miles on foot. His perseverance is indeed admirable.</p>
<p>Now, the peace fallacy that suddenly appeared in a certain newspaper in Hong Kong, although no reliable evidence has been obtained, we can first have such an assumption: that the author "Peixian" is not Mr. Zhu Ziqing. Based on Mr. Zhu's consistent attitude, he would never abandon himself to this point. Then, a certain newspaper's false claim of another person's name to fabricate treasonous remarks is indeed a serious crime that cannot be forgiven! (Editor's note: The Hong Kong traitorous newspapers often deliberately borrow the names of domestic writers to confuse the public. Recently, the newspapers of these traitors have also imitated this practice. We must expose this trick, and we hope readers will pay attention to it.)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Regarding this book ("Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin" 1 (written by Hu Shanyuan, a total of sixteen short stories, published by World Book Company, priced at four corners)), Yang Fei has already introduced it in the eighth issue of "Da Cha." Now I want to try to explore the techniques or art of this book.</p>
<p>The materials used by the author are all listed in the appendix, which allows us to compare them and understand the hard work the author has put in. The simpler ones seem to be "Jiangyin Houlu" by Ming Zhu Chunjia and "Huang Yuqi's Uprising in Zhutang" by Qing Ji Liuqi to write about "Huang Yuqi," and "Tianxiang Pavilion Notes" to write about "Hu Zhixue," "Xu Wu," and "Li Jiali." "Yuchu New Records" is used to write about "Qi Sanlang." The more laborious ones are from Qing Han's "Jiangyin City Defense Records," Qing Xu Chongxi's "Sequel to Jiangyin City Defense Records," and Qing Shen Tao's "Jiangshang Yiwen" to write about "Xu Yong," "The Ji Brothers," "Cheng Bi," "Wang Hua," "Old Man Tang," "Chen Xianqin," and "Xu Yuyang." The approximate focus is as follows: June 1st and 2nd (Xu Yong and the Ji Brothers), 15th (Cheng Bi), July 12th and 29th (Old Man Tang), 20th to 27th (Xu Yuyang), August 2nd (Wang Hua), 8th (Chen Xianqin). However, "Old Man Tang" and "Boy Tang" are not necessarily father and son. Combining them together is more interesting. This is a bold and clever point of the author, because novels are not exactly faithful history, and there is no need to be overly precise. The five-watch tune, surrender song, and reply song added in the "Xu Yong" chapter, although written by the author, are much more interesting than a simple mention.</p>
<p>The most complex are probably these three chapters: "Huang Mingjiang," "The He Brothers," and "Chen Erlang." The name Huang Mingjiang is derived from legends, so the names vary. "Jiangyin City Defense Records" and "Jiangshang Yiwen" write it as Huang Mingjiang, while "Sequel" and "Luqiao Records" write it as "Huang Yunjiang," and "Tianxiang Pavilion Notes" writes it as Wang Yungang, three completely different names. The author deliberated among them, weaving these five texts together, and making very interesting couplet-style dialogues, which took a lot of effort. The He Brothers are He Chang and He Tai. The author cleverly puts the "two brothers" from "Ming Ji Nan Lue" on the heads of the He brothers. "Chen Erlang" is based on "Anecdotes of the Ming and Qing Dynasties," but it cleverly organizes many anecdotes after the city's fall. The beginning quotes the section about people hiding in the Buddhist temple from "Oral Accounts of Refugees," and the middle section borrows Chen Erlang's tour to insert two tragic facts (the female corpse shadow and the naked women amidst arrows, both seen in Tianxiang Pavilion Notes), which is quite ingenious as if seen through Chen Erlang's eyes.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the following four chapters should be the highlights of the entire book: "Old Man Tang," "Chen Xianqin," "The He Brothers," and "Chen Erlang." On the one hand, the stories themselves are the most stimulating, and on the other hand, the author's skills are pure and refined. "Old Man Tang" is written as fiery as reading "Water Margin" or "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." In the ending of "Chen Xianqin," the author deliberately plays tricks. Although it is not explicitly stated who the assassin underwater is, the reader already knows that it is Chen Xianqin. Moreover, according to unofficial history, this assassin is not necessarily Chen Xianqin. The author's vague writing is恰好 consistent with unofficial history. "The He Brothers" almost entirely uses financial terms to compare the war against the Qing army, which is wonderfully unique and a rare good article. The nine-year-old "Chen Erlang" is also written as extremely cute, with the gestures and tone of a child, and Ali Da's ignorance of the pleasures between people is also portrayed in detail.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that "Yan Dian Shi," this supporter of the Jiangyin City Defense, does not have a short story. Although he is a dian shi, he is still a righteous man of Jiangyin. The qualification of being a commoner should not be canceled just because he became an official. Moreover, he had already retired, and being a dian shi was only a promotion by the people. Also, there are no female resistance fighters; for example, Huang Yuqi's wife's repeated suicides are good material, but this is perhaps demanding perfection.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Marching Jottings <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>"What are you saying? How could the commander-in-chief just eat yours for free?"</p>
<p>"Hehe."</p>
<p>"How much are you selling them for?"</p>
<p>"One corner for eight, commander-in-chief."</p>
<p>"It's easy to handle things once you have money." I looked at him and felt that this shop owner was too pitiful. Why are soldiers so feared to this extent? But upon closer reflection on our own past, I understood this cowering character. It is not right to easily blame them. I continued to ask, "You have so much stock, why don't you open your shop and sell it?"</p>
<p>"Hehe, commander-in-chief."</p>
<p>"Are you afraid that the commanders-in-chief won't pay?"</p>
<p>"Hehe, in the past, some commanders-in-chief ate and didn't..."</p>
<p>"Ate and didn't pay, is that right?"</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"Have any troops passed through here recently?"</p>
<p>"Many have passed through."</p>
<p>"Did anyone buy your hemp flowers?"</p>
<p>"Of course," he gradually became more familiar with us, "quite a few ate them."</p>
<p>"Did they pay you?"</p>
<p>"They all bought them with cash."</p>
<p>"Were there any who didn't pay?"</p>
<p>"No, there weren't."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you open your shop for business?"</p>
<p>He smiled and then said with worldly wisdom:</p>
<p>"In these times, who dares to say who is a good person?"</p>
<p>"No wonder the entire street is closed, so that's the reason."</p>
<p>"Hehe, there's just no way around it, the common people are suffering."</p>
<p>"××××××××××."</p>
<p>"You know, ×××× are really bad. If they eat your hemp flowers, don't expect any money. Not only do they eat things without paying, but they also ×××××."</p>
<p>"Hehe, people say that ××× are civilized."</p>
<p>"In what way are they civilized?"</p>
<p>"When they buy things, they not only give money, but they also give extra."</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?"</p>
<p>"They often help the common people."</p>
<p>I looked at Wang, and Wang looked at me. This is a miracle. We haven't met such a person on the entire journey. It turns out that he must have been exposed to contrary propaganda from the traitors before this.</p>
<p>Can we blame him? No! Education is insufficient! Culture is backward! When I walked back to my lodgings, I deeply felt that our propaganda work was still not good enough. We must work harder in this area! (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e62">New Attitudes of Guizhou Youth <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>Many people do not understand Guizhou. They think that the "Kamchatka" of Guizhou is still living under the haze of opium. In fact, Guizhou was indeed like this in the past. Moreover, the gentlemen who report on Guizhou often seize on Guizhou's weaknesses to write dispatches and features, which makes outsiders ignore or overlook Guizhou's progress.</p>
<p>Now, the clear facts are in front of the world. Guizhou is indeed shedding its old coat and putting on new clothes and new content in the flames of the War of Resistance. Look, the Guizhou Wartime Work Corps reported here is already the third group of organized Guizhou youth going to the battlefield.</p>
<p>They set off from Guizhou last November, crossing mountains and rivers, overcoming thousands of difficulties and hardships. They passed through many large and small cities, always taking advantage of the opportunity to work, even holding research meetings and discussions on the bus. In addition to doing general propaganda for the masses, their work is more importantly focused on propaganda for ethnic minorities such as the Miao, Yi, and Yao. Because several of them are Miao people who have already been assimilated by the Han Chinese, they are naturally very familiar with the customs, habits, languages, and personalities of the Miao and Yi. Therefore, they have compiled many Miao songs, Miao folk rhymes, and Miao stories... to promote "Small Dynasty invading Big Dynasty" (meaning Japan's invasion of China), to kill all the people in the "Big Dynasty," and to call on the Miao people to unite and drive out the "Small Dynasty" troops. At the same time, they also explain the Chinese government's implementation of benevolence to the Miao people... This is really very important work and work that has been overlooked in the past.</p>
<p>In addition, they also collect all the good customs and local political strengths to prepare for the construction of a new Guizhou.</p>
<p>There are a total of 103 of them. The leader is Mr. Chen Tilu, the executive committee member of the Guizhou Provincial Party Department, and there is also a political instructor.</p>
<p>Most of the members are middle school or elementary school teachers. Before going to the front line, they received three months of training. In order to achieve greater results in their work on the front line, they also practiced in many villages in Guizhou for two months before setting off. Therefore, in life, they are militarized; they carry their own luggage and cook their own meals; they are also popular with the people: they do not put on military airs. In terms of work, they have developed good planning and collectivity; in terms of learning, there are both group and collective methods. They also publish a "Wartime Work" three-day journal as a forum for practicing writing and expressing opinions.</p>
<p>Speaking of their treatment, it is really very limited. Each person receives twelve yuan per month, from the head of the delegation to the cooks. However, the operating expenses are very rich. In addition to the thousands of yuan donated automatically by all walks of life in the province, they are also subsidized by the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Anti-Japanese Association. In the future, they may be assigned to the command of General Wu Qihui of the Fourth Army, which will make the economic conditions more generous and the work more optimistic.</p>
<p>According to what this reporter knows, most of the members of the delegation were wealthy young masters and ladies in the past, or they had very strict party prejudices. But now, everyone has the noble, heroic determination and attitude of enduring hardship, eliminating prejudices, and going to war together.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, they officially went to the front line of the northern section of the Yuehan Railway. In addition to their work, they also represent the people of all walks of life in Guizhou to comfort the heroic soldiers fighting against Japan!</p>
<h3 id="e63">Snow Clouds <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Snow·Blood</p>
<p>The snow was covered with patches of blood. Tonight, capturing last night's dream, I remembered this vividly.</p>
<p>Memory's hand reached further into the past, lifting the curtain of childhood: After the snow cleared, I went with my third uncle to the mountains to hunt wild rabbits. One shot hit, and bright red blood dripped onto the snow. That scene was no different from last night's dream.</p>
<p>Recalling these things, a wave of melancholy struck my heart like lightning. Ah, precious childhood, where did you flow?</p>
<p>Is my third uncle, who lives on the Guandong grasslands, still safe and sound? What is the fate of his hunting rifle? Has my third uncle used it to hunt enemies? The motherland has been shaken for more than a year. What about Guandong? Surely patriotic soldiers have gathered in the mountains?</p>
<p>It's snowing again. But the snow is no longer covered with the blood of wild rabbits, but with the blood of patriotic soldiers. Nourishing the frozen earth, in the spring, they will sprout flowers of freedom and victory.</p>
<p>Sea·Clouds</p>
<p>The sea roared, shattering the calm moon on the sea. It detests that obedient moon. The sea waves churned, the silver flowers shattered, as if they were about to surge into the seabed.</p>
<p>Clouds rushed from unknown distances, filling the sky, devouring the moon. The earth was pitch black, pressing down on the surging sea.</p>
<p>The night wind blew up the sorrow of the dark clouds, crying - the heavy rain came.</p>
<p>The sky tore apart the lightning. Gaps of light illuminated the mad sea. The waves seemed to want to destroy this world, and the earth shook.</p>
