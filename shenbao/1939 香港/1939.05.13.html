<h3>加緊生產，堅持抗戰</h3>
<p>— 李富春</p>
<p>同志們　生產運動我們以前還沒有大規模做過；今天我們要有計劃的大規模的進行起來。這是我們在目前迎接民族抗戰新階段的時候。黨給與我們每一個同志的新的××任務！</p>
<p>關於生產運動我們還缺乏很多的經驗成績，來充分地說明和證實我的報吿；因此，我只能根據中央的指示，作一概括的簡明的說明與啓發；希望大家以後在生產的實踐中，在勞動的過程中，充實我們的經驗，發揚我們的成績。</p>
<p>一　生產運動的意義與目的</p>
<p>在今天抗戰新階段的轉變中，我們要準備克服二切困難，渡過一切難關，來爭取抗戰的最後勝利。我們估計到抗戰發展的前途與邊區的實際狀况，將要來到的是財政經濟物質十困難的增加，我們目前的工作，應該克服這種困難。</p>
<p>克服困難，首先要依靠我們自己的力量，換句話說，就是要我們自力更生，要我們自己參加勞動，用我們自己的勞力，發展我們的農業工業各各生產和商業貿易，呆證我們後方和前方在財政經濟物　上的供給，不受戰爭破壞的影響而能自給自足。生產運動的發展，使我們的生活條件能够與戰爭條件相配合，相一致，以求得抗戰前途更順利的發展。</p>
<p>還有，我們發展生產運動，不僅能够克服困難，渡過難關，而日要更進一步地改善我們的生活。同志們知道，我們是主張澈底的實現三民主義的；我們主張堅持抗戰以求得中華民埃的獨立，自由，解放。這說是實現三民主義的民埃主義。在邊區已經建立了民主的政權，最近我們根據國民政府的法令和抗戰建國綱領，又開了代表整個邊區人民的參議會，這就是實現三民主義的民族主義。現在我們又要發展的生產運動，進一步改善人民的生活，這就是我們要澈底的實現三民主義的民生主義的具體表現。</p>
<p>那末，我們今天這個生產運動大會，就叫做民生主義大會，也是可以的。在抗戰過程中，如果能够改善人民的生活，我們一定更能進行很好的抗戰建國的工作；我們一定更能發揮偉大的民族抗戰的威力。</p>
<p>發展生產運動，能够解決我們將來財政經濟物質上的困難；不僅在我們全國二部分的邊區應該這樣做就是從全國講來、要克服空前禾有的困難，爭取最後勝利，也是應該這樣做的。我們邊區的生產運動，在全國應該起推動的與模範的作用；把我們發展生產運動的經驗與成績告訴全國，提供克服困難的方針和辦法，使全國各地的生產運動大大的開展起來。使全國人民對抗戰必勝，建國必成，都具有堅强的信心——落後的鄉村一定是能够進步的，廣大的鄉村的進步和發展，一定是能够最後戰勝×人現在所佔據的城市的。這種堅强的信心，是我們堅持抗戰，堅持持久戰，圾後戰勝×人具體的必要條件。簡明的說，我們發展邊區生產運動的目的有下面幾個：</p>
<p>第一，克服我們邊區財政經濟物質上的困難，以現有的物質條件做基礎，必須做到農工業各種生產的自給自足：更進一步的改善人民生活，更好的實現三民主義的民生主義。</p>
<p>第二，拿我們邊邊發展主產運動模範的實例去推動全國的生產運動；堅强全國人民對抗戰必勝的信心。紛碎托派漢奸所說：『大城市失掉了，經濟困難，抗戰必亡』的亡國論。</p>
<p>第三，展生產運動，我們每一個人都要參加體力勞動，在思想上可以改變過去許多人輕視體力勞動的這種不正確的觀點。到生產前線上去！把理論與產際密切的聯系起來，在勞動的實踐中。我們可以深切的體驗出「勞工神聖」的眞理來，</p>
<p>第四，參加生產運動，可以健强我們的身體，偉，大的民埃抗戰，在持久的殘酷　清的鬥爭中，我們不但需要有正確的戰略戰衛去瓦解×人，消滅×人，我們還需要具有堅強不拔的體　，才能够應付來日的大難。在勞動的實踐，把我們的身體鍛鍊成為鋼筋鐵　，當我們上前綫去與×人　鬥的時候，一定能够把兇惡的×人消滅在我們自己的手裏！</p>
<p>同志們！怎樣才能够達到我們的目的呢？需要我們大家「自己動手」。才能够完放這一偉大的艱鉅的任務！</p>
<p>二　我們在發展生產運動中的困難和怎樣克服困難</p>
<p>這樣空前的工作——大規模的全部動員的生產運動我們以前是沒有做過的，從邊區的實際情况來說，困難是仔在着的，我們的困雖：</p>
<p>第一，勞動力的不够，勞動力的不平均，我們從農工出身的廣大的幹部，他們是具有優省的勞動力的。但我們許多機關中的工作人員與學校的學生，他們從來就沒有參加過　力勞動，沒有種過菜，沒有種過地，因此，各機關部隊學校羣衆圑體，有的勞動力强，有的勞勁力弱，是現着勞　力不够或勞動力不平均的現象：這是我們生產運動第一個困難。</p>
<p>第二，耕地的困難，我們邊區地　人稀，有廣大土地的地方，沒有人去耕　，可是有些地方人口又很集中，峽乏土地耕種，比如在延安二十里週圍的地方，人口就有三萬多，耕地無論如何是不够分配的，這是我們二個困難</p>
<p>第三，資本困——要發展邊區的生產運動，首先就要發展晨業，再進而謀工商業之　展，可是，因為我們資本不足的關係，使我們在農業生產上感到工具不足，耕牛不足的困難。至於我們邊　的工業過去也沒有什麽基礎，商業一向也不怎樣發達。資本不足這是我們第三個困難。</p>
<p>第四，專門技衛人才的抉乏——在農工商業各方面找們感到專門技術才非常缺乏，組織和領導大規模生產運動的人才不够，這是我們第四個困難。</p>
<p>第五，天時地利上的困難——撾去我們陝北農產業方面，可以說是『靠天吃飯』的。自從我們×路軍來到陜北已經三年多了，在這三年中，因×人進攻整個中國，陝北成為西北抗戰的堡壘；我們動員全邊區的人民參加抗戰，『國泰民安』，當然談不到；但，只就農業生產上說，也可以說得上『風調雨順』了。不過，我們根據陝北同志所說，陝北的旱災是有三年一次　五年一次的周期性的；去年雪下得太多，雨水不足，今年有發生旱災的可能；這是我們第五個困難。</p>
<p>上面這五個困難，我們是否能夠克報呢？我們的答覆是：我們能够克服困難——我們完全有力量能够克服困難！</p>
<p>第一，怎樣克服勞動力不够，不平均的困難——我們可以在使用勞動力的時候，適當的配合起來；勞動力强的人深耕，開荒；勞動力弱的人，施肥，除草。我們全邊區黨，政，軍機關，部隊，學校，羣衆圑體，根據我們本身的勞動條件，與邊區廣大羣衆的勞動力配合起來，互相調劑。同時黨，政，軍，學校，羣衆圑體各部門各單位自己也應該進行調劑工作，如　務人員，通信員，勤務員，伙夫，馬　我們都可以調劑一下，節　他們的勞動力，用到生產方面去；（如擴大準備由學生自己煮飯，把伙夫抽出來種地）雜務人員的工作可以由工作人員或學生來代替；我想，第一種困難是可能克服的。</p>
<p>第二，怎樣克服耕地的困難——士地與人口的調劑，嬰求得到適當的配台，是比較困難的；但。這一調劑　作是絕對需要的。我們把大多　的檅關專校羣衆圑體有組織的有計劃的進行必要的分散，部隊可以建　耕地後方用『以人就地』的辦法來解決耕地問題，這完全是辦得到的。</p>
<p>第三，怎樣克服資本不夠的困難——資本不夠，我們可以進行廣泛的節省運動，把節省下來的錢拿來練班已經這樣做，而且成績很好。他們的工作人員與學生在極艱苦的環境中，自己上山打柴，下溝担水，省吃省用地節省了兩百多塊錢做生產基金。如果黨政軍各組織部門大家都這樣做——把糧食，　油，紙張，文具等都節省一些。一個月兩個月經常的有計劃的生產運動，都是不成問題的。同志們！我要發揚我們艱舌卓絕英男奮鬥的作風！全國工商業家到我們邊區來投資，開展我們邊區的國防經濟建設，凡是對抗戰有利的生產投資。我們的邊區政府都是樂於接受的，保護的，獎勵的！</p>
<p>第四，怎樣克服技術人才缺乏的因難——指導　業生產的專門技術人才，一方面可以騁請農業專門家　指導；同時，我們還要請敎請敎那些一字不識的×北的老百姓，因為他們有實際工作經騐，而且熱悉×北的實際情形。樊　請學稼。孔子說：『吾不如老農』；×北『老農』的經騐，是似得我們好好的學習與發展的！</p>
<p>第五，怎樣克服天時地利上的困難——水旱天災，雖然是自然的威力，但，事在人為，人力也是可以征服自然的。要想减輕或免除旱災，我們應該注意修水利，植樹林，改良生產方法，選擇耐旱種子等等工作。</p>
<p>三　我們的保證在那裡？</p>
<p>我們不僅能够克服上面所說的那些困難，而且我們在邊區發展生產運動，還具備着有利的條件，保證我們偉大的生產任務的完成。我們的保證在那裏？</p>
<p>第一，邊區的廣大的民衆，是完成我們生產任務的主力軍；邊區有二百萬人口。這兩百萬個老百姓，在民主的生活之下解除了苛捐雜稅剝削榨取的痛苦。實現了民生主義，大家都萬衆一心地圑結組織在邊區政府的周圍；他們一定能够響影邊區的號召，提高地們的勞動熱忱，完成他們的任務。</p>
<p>第二，在全邊區黨地軍各機關各學校所有脫離生產的部隊機關學校大槪有五萬人；把這五萬人集體的組織起來，這一個生動的力量是很大的。大家都是自覺的志願的為革命而奮門的，在這五萬人中每一個成員都理解他自已參加生運動的必要和重要。我們可以估計到：當這一支五萬人的生動的力量。大瑫步地走上生產戰綫發揚也們勞動的火力的時候，他們一定能完他們的任務。</p>
<p>第三，我們邊區的作風是艱苦奮們的作風；我們是布爾塞維克的作風，吃苦耐勞，是我們的家常便飯；我們遇着任何困難，都要向困難作鬥爭，誓死也不向困難投降的；這是我們革命的傳統，每一個黨員，在這次生產運動中，都應該發揚我們革命的傳統，保證我們的任務的完成。</p>
<p>第四，過去我們雖然沒有大規模的開展生產運動，但在個別的地方小規模的生產運動是收到很大的或績，因此我們對於生產運動是有着相當經的的；（如×路軍後方留守部隊，保安部隊，警衛營，各機關，各學校在去年一年中打柴，燒炭，養猪，種　等等）把這些經騐匯起來，組織起來，作為　們基本的經騐，再把它發展起來；這是我們完成生產任務最可靠的保證。</p>
<p>四　生產運動的具體計劃</p>
<p>第一，發展農業是我們生產運動中心的一　——我們的生產運動要發展農工商業前面我已經說過了，但我們要以發展農業生產為中心的一環。因為邊區　濟比較落後的農業區，有廣大的土地可以耕種。而且我們可以普遍的動昌廣大民衆以及黨，政，軍各機關各部隊各學校各羣衆體圑參加農業生產，解决我們自已的吃飯問題。其次，我們要發展邊區的工業，只因邊區工業過去沒有基礎；所以我們要從手工業，國防工業着手進行，我們要發展邊區的商業。只因邊區交通不便，出產不　，所以我們要普遍的發展合作社運動，保障邊區內日常用品的供給，幷且能够把邊區的生產品運輸出去。</p>
<p>第二，對于發展農業生產的具體要求——發展農業旣然是我們的中心任務，我們要求全邊地兩百萬民衆和黨政軍各機關，學校，羣衆圑體，留守兵圑，保安部隊都參加農業生產，為增加農業生產品而鬥爭。</p>
<p>第三，怎樣具體進行工作——種地種糧。在廣大民衆中和這次邊區參議會已經詳細的討論和具體的計劃了，在今年春耕運動中，動員全邊地兩百萬民　參加春耕，要做到；</p>
<p>一，計劃今年開荒六十萬畝；</p>
<p>二，改良種子；</p>
<p>三，改良農業生產工具；因，改良耕種方　——深耕，施肥，除草。</p>
<p>從各方面努力進行，可以保證今年糧食生產總額增加百分之二十。這　，一方面可以保證人民休活的改善；同時，因總的生產量的增加，我們的救國公糧也可以增加，保證脫難生產的部隊一年的糧食。我們可以看到邊地兩百萬人民，在民主政治的生活下很活　的參加生產運動，完到他們的戳鬥任務。怎樣動員，組織和領導兩百萬民衆來完成任務，這就需要我們邊區黨委，邊區政府和羣衆　體努力領導了。</p>
<p>第四，關於動員組織和領導羣衆參加農業生產　注意的要點：</p>
<p>一，要各級政府確進行實的調查工作：對於人口，耕地，荒地，耕牛，農具等都應該有詳細調查；我們必須迅速的完成這一工作，以便將確實數目與實際情况配合起來，予以適當的調劑，這是當地政府，黨部與羣衆圑體應該首先做到的。</p>
<p>二，我們的動員工作要用敎育的啟發的方式，不要用强迫命令的辦法；我們要進行詳細的解釋工作與耐心的說服工作，使每一個邊區的人民都了解我們要用發展生產運動來改善人民的生活。</p>
<p>三，組織羣衆的勞動力，除了組織壯丁勞動外，特別要注意組織婦女參加生產；通去邊地婦女參加生產的還不多，甚至有的地方以為婦女參加生產是很差恥的事情；這方面我們要進行很大的敎育設服工作，尤其要求我們大部分婦女幹部熱烈的參加生產運動，起模範作用。我們希望我們×北的幹部向自已的老婆多做一點政治工作，動員她們到生產戰線上去，我們的同志應該拿自己的模範行勸去影響整個邊區的婦女。此外我們還要把兒童，老年人，和抗日軍人家屬都組織起來，使他們都熱烈的積極的參加生產。總而言之，我們要把全邊區的人民無論老幼男女，都組　到生產運動中來：這才叫做眞正的『有力出力』！</p>
<p>四，各地政府應該帮助民衆調劑耕地，勞動力，群牛　具，等工作，我們一方面可以鼓勵老百姓自動的解　問題，同時如果老百姓需要政府帮助的時候，我們應該想出許多辦法帮助他們解決問題。</p>
<p>五，進行生產敎育工作，敎育人民，帮助人民。改良耕種方法，改良播種方法，改良工具，要做到；所有原有耕　部要進行深耕，但進行深耕的地方並不放棄開　的工作。要做到：所有新開的荒地，部要翻兩次土：但，開荒的地方，也不停止深耕。不管深耕或開荒，都要多加肥料，動於除草，這樣，才能够增加土地的生產力。</p>
<p>六，各地政府機關的工作人員，要站在老百姓我的前面，積極的參加生產，起模範作用，領導老百姓大踏步的前進。千萬不要『只要人家幹，自己不動手：』給老百姓極不好的影響。</p>
<p>七，實行廣大的獎勵制度，大的提高勞動者的勞動熱沈，在今年一年中，我們要產生出成千成萬的勞動英雄來。（過去邊區政府已經做過，成績很好）</p>
<p>八，厲行工作檢香制度，要想完成我們的生產任務，首先要求黨政車各機關採取一致的步調，一致的領導，與經常不斷地督促和檢查：今年中我們準備進行生產運動的工作檢查，看我們各方面的工作是否能够依照生產計劃而逐步實現。</p>
<p>這幾點意見，希望今天到會的參議員同志，邊區黨委邊地政府　羣衆圑體中負食的諸位同志，詳細的加以研究，並適當的運用到具體的工作中去。</p>
<p>第五，脫離生產的，也要生產——政軍各機關，部隊，學校，羣衆圑體，凡是脫離生產的都要參加生產。我在這裏，携出下列幾個具體任務請黨政軍各組織部門負責同志深切的予以注意，參照執行：</p>
<p>一，黨政軍各組織部門生產任務的分配：</p>
<p>邊地政府以下　一六·五〇〇石</p>
<p>軍事機關部除學校　一二·五〇〇石</p>
<p>中央機關直屬學校　一·〇〇〇石</p>
<p>二，對邊區一級以下的生產任務之說明：在邊區自給自足·我們計劃邊區一級以下完成細糧一萬六千五百石（合組糧大約三萬石·）這個數目字雖大，但沒有問題是可以完成的·當然·這計劃的完成，需要我們邊地一級的幹部和第一個同志尤其是全邊區的保安部隊以戰鬥的精神來完成的。這　應該注意到：土地與勞動力的調劑，對某驟有多少拼地，多少荒地，及對基縣土質的肥沃或貧瘠，都應該有詳細的調有和具體的了解。比如三邊土地少產糧就少，　環士地多產糧就多，地理條件對於農業生產是很有關係的，不能把整個邊區都平均起來。還要注意到：與廣大人民的配合，在工作中取得廣大羣衆的帮助。這是完成生產任務的必要條件。為什麽要在脫囉生產的邊區一級以下的黨，政，軍，學校、羣衆　體中完成糧食達到自給自足呢？我們的理由是：（一）邊區一級以下的同志們他們對於農生產最有經驗，尤其是全邊區保安部隊的勞動力最强。（二）邊區一級以下的同志們最容易接近羣衆，他們不但能够帮助羣衆推動羣衆的生產，而且還能够取得廣大羣衆的帮助。（三）邊區一級以下黨政軍各級組織部分散在全邊區各地，他們沒有土地不够人力不均　困難。（四）邊區一級以下的同志們最大多　都是陝北同志，他們不但人地相宜，而且在過去十年來的革命鬥爭中，他們是最富於艱苦奮鬥的精神的。有了這　四個理由，我想，我們一級的同志們不但可以完成任務，甚至可以　過任務。</p>
<p>三，對軍事機關學校及×路軍留守部隊生產任務之說明：我們對於軍事方面的要求是完成細糧一萬二千五百石（合相糧二萬五千石）。這個數目字並不大，因為軍事方面的人數相當多，而且勞動力也相當强。我想：在不妨害學習不妨害工作的基本方針下，發楊抗大的作風——一我們是勞動者的先鋒』！他們完成任務也是沒有問題的。</p>
<p>四，對中央關及直屬學校生產任務之說明：中央所屬各機關及直屬各學校，我們要求完成一千石細糧。這數目字雖不大；一則因為人數少，二則因為勞動力小，據我們估計，這一千石細糧任務的完成，還得我們中央一級以下的同志們大大的努力呢。</p>
<p>第六，關於種的問題——我們要求黨政軍各組織部門各　食單位普遍的進行種菜連動。（附帶種馬料）將來無論那一部分都要做到菜蔬能够自合自足，而且還要能多吃菜。我們準備從七月分起普遍的减少菜錢，其减少的標準如下：</p>
<p>一，原七分者减四分，發三分。</p>
<p>二，原五分者减三分，發二分。</p>
<p>三，原四分者减二分，發二分。</p>
<p>四，部隊一般的原數只减一分。</p>
<p>第七，關於農業副　的生產——根據現有力量，各機關各部隊各學校要自已喂猪　羊，養豬來改善自已的生活；我們把猪喂的那樣胖，把羊養的那樣肥，大家一個禮拜多吃幾頓肉，我想大家都不會不贊成吧</p>
<p>第八，關於工業生產——因為過去我們邊區工業沒有基礎。目前我們只能從手工業和國防工業着手進行：</p>
<p>一，今後我們的穿衣問題將愈感困難，我們要據大紡織工廠，發展民中家庭手工業的組織。使我們的　衣問題得到適當的解決。</p>
<p>二，着手建立初步的國防工　；開採煤　，擴充油廠和造紙廠，增加食鹽產量，並開辦其他歸於日常用品及軍用品小規　的製造廠。</p>
<p>三，建立自然科學研究所。</p>
<p>四，獎勵私人企業與私人投資，幫助人民發展各項手工業。</p>
<p>第九，關於發展商業問題——普遍的發展合作社運動，爲改善人民生活的必要條件，但私人營業也要獎勵：</p>
<p>一，今後邊區各地合作社應該做到老百姓熱烈加入，使這種台作社成為廣大民衆自已的合作社。成為改善人民生活的一種工具。</p>
<p>二，各組織部門的合作社，應該統一起來，黨政軍各部門的合作社應各有其統一的領導，才能够收如臂使指之效。部隊的合作社應統一在留守部隊供給處之下；各地民衆的合作社應統一在邊區政府建設總領導之下；中央機關及直屬漣校的合作社應統一在中財政經濟部之下。</p>
<p>三，辦合作社應注意之點：（一）收支賬自要求淸楚；（二）調劑物質，不要『奇貨可居』！（三）分發紅利時應提出一部分基　作為發展合作社之用。（四）能够供給大衆所需要的東西和日常用品。做到改　生活。</p>
<p>四，關於私人營業；爲着發展邊區商業起見，邊區政府應該保護和獎勵私人商業。但要防止奸商投機，操縱。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本對英國的恫嚇</h3>
<p>据昨日路透社東電，日本軍部機關報的「國民新聞」，日昨著文恐嚇英國大使寇爾個人的安全，首謂寇爾在重慶的活動，蓄意加强英國對我抗戰的援助，以抗拒日本，繼誣英大使利用其地位保護蔣委員長夫婦安全，最後提出警告稱：「如彼將來繼續施以暗助及濫用其外交使節權利，則日本將不能保其安全。</p>
<p>這不但是對英國大使個人的問題，實際上也就是對英國的恫嚇，另一方面又是對我最高領袖及神聖抗戰的侮辱。我們對於這種言論，實在沒有勇氣守鍼默一。首先我們要聲明的，就是我們對日的神聖抗喊，我們决心用英勇的鬥爭和壯烈的犧牲來爭取最後的勝利一，我們無須採用卑鄙的手段，我們最高領袖的堂堂行動，用不着外國「使節權利」的掩護。事實勝過詭辯，英國前大使許格森之所以被掃射，也卽×人疑心我國重要官員與許氏同乘，然而結果如何呢？又日機對美國巴納號之轟炸，也是出於同樣的動機，而其結果又適足證明侵略者的心懼與無　。實則利用外國的保護的却是侵略者，而不是我們。日本飛機幾次這就只有　的侵略者自己纔能知道得淸楚！再者，日本商品更是到處假胃外國的商標在世界市場上推銷，甚至於胃充我國國貨，偷在我國市塲上傾銷。世界上還有出其右的事物嗎？</p>
<p>不過，這裏我們要對侵略者的中英關係觀下一番的檢討和判斷。不久的過去，疲於中日大戰的×人，確實有意求和，他要求英國出頭調解，但是認識我國最淸楚的英國大使沒有適應它的要求，於是日本窮兵黷武的軍閥懷恨起他們來。同時，日本對於英國的遠東政策認為不能動搖絲毫，所以近來一方面發動排英運動，另一方面對英大肆恐嚇。「國民新聞」常著社評討論中英關係，認為英國為着確保其在華權益，必更繼續援助中國抗戰。同時，對於我們抗戰到底的信念，也巳深信。他們預料着我們將必堅决在重慶實行山岳戰到底，即把桂林焦土化也所不辭。他們還假定即令昆明及重慶失陷後，我們最高領袖斷斷不會屈服。他們認為「蔣政權」的「强味」在於（一）英法蘇精神上的同情，（二）外交的援助，及（三）武噐的輸送；並且些這援助，將來更要積極化。</p>
<p>×人到這地步巳充分暴露出「色厲而內荏」。他們譏笑着：英法已經充分嘗過德意的「苦杯」，英法再也不敢在亞洲嘗更大的「苦杯」。但是對於希特勒所强烈要求的德意日三國軍事同盟，却飴終不敢加入，至少不敢明顯地得罪英法。最近還命令駐英大使重光葵，乘歐洲多事的機會，進行對英外交的調整。×人一再屈膝於態度强硬的蘇聯，英國該怎樣對付這樣一個「色厲而內荏」的國家，是不難想到的。</p>

<h3>建立中的雁北抗日游擊根据地</h3>
<p>— 談鋒·喬力</p>
<p>【民晉西通訊】在山西的北部，有一道長城的內城·斷續·紆曲的順着恒山，洪　山，從平型關，雁門關，再爬過楊方口，向西北直抵綏遠邊境，與外城會合，它橫斷的將晉北切　了。這被分　的一塊廣大的土地，東西足有四五百里，南北也有二三百里，它包含着天鎮、湯高、廣靈、靈邱、渾源、大同、懷仁、應縣、山陰、朔縣、左雲、右玉、平魯等十三縣、因爲在雁門關以北、所以總合而簡稱之為雁北。</p>
<p>雁北，差不多是恒山·管涔·洪濤幾條大的山脈包圍中，氣候寒冷，同時又變化無定，在這勇有着這樣一個童謠：『雁們關外野人家，早穿皮襖晚穿紗，還有一件希奇事，抱上火爐吃西瓜』。我們可以想到雁北的氣候是怎樣寒冷和變化無常了。就由于土地交通氣候的種種關係，而決定了這地方的貧因和　後。一般的說，人民生活都很貧苦。農產品以殺。黍，馬　茨為大宗。其次為高梁，小麥。小麵在這裏已是上等的食品，因出產不多，部分是仰給于關內各縣；穀黍為中華食品，因本地產量很大，一般人家都以之爲主要食品，高粱僅為貧民貧用。所產食糧，尙足自給。工業幷不甚發達，工廠都集中于大同附近，如採煤礦的礦務局，保晉公司，麵粉公司，酒精公司等。但大同被×人佔領後，整個雁北的工業，就可以說全被摧穀了。在這裏還有，富的煤礦，大同·懷仁，渾，左　，右玉等均有出產，在山陰，應縣，懷仁一帶，又出產鹽，除供雁北各縣食用之外，而緩遠及雁門關內各縣，亦有大量輸出，至于文化敎育，在這裏無梁地是落後的，這是為落後的經濟條件所決定着的。我們可以說大同是雁北的經濟文化的中心，大同的失陷，已經摧毀了雁北的經濟文化的基礎，迨至整個雁北的淪陷，經過×人鐵蹄殘踏之後，更使這落後的一切，摧毀無遺！所以，我們可以知道，在這落後的地區上建立起來的抗日游擊根据地，在這建立的初期，受着困難環境的限制，一定是不十分建全的。但是在總動委會，公犧邊區工委會及第二專員公署，×區辦事處領導奮鬥之下，它已經潮漸的向前邁進着。</p>
<p>這一新建立的抗日游擊根據地，它在左雲，右玉，大同，懷仁，山陰，岱岳，朔縣，平魯的當中，南北長約二百餘里，東西寬約百餘里，它處在×人四面句圍之中的。不過第一，我們在這裏有着相當大的兵力，如第二區保安六支隊，警備六圑，察綏游擊軍，敎幹大隊等，可以說有勝過×人的力量，他不敢輕易進犯；第二，×人兵力配備的不够，除了在他佔領的城鎭上，駐有部隊之外，其餘廣大的士地，他是無法統治的。雁北×人的確實數目，我們雖然不得而知，但就一般說，大同，左雲·右玉等縣經常駐有三四百×人以外·至于岱岳，吳鎭等地，也只不過三四十個×人而已·這　弱的兵力，使他不敢離開佔領地，來向我們進犯。第三，有廣大的羣衆擁護和帮助我們，這是×人不能勝過的偉大力量，有以上三個原因，所以我們的抗×游擊根據地，在×人包圍之中建立起來了！成長起來了—而×人對之是無可奈何的。</p>
<p>我們要想知道這一新的正在建立中的抗×游擊根据地，是樣在×人包圍中，在艱苦的環境中建立起來的？那麽我們不能不囘溯到過去：那是前年九月的中旬，×從天鎭，陽高一直　到了大同，在九月底又迫到雁門關，那時各縣已先後相繼失陷，行政機關和軍隊也都撤退了。留在這裏工作的，只有領導民運的幾個圑體，他們在艱苦的環境中奮門着，發展了廣大的游擊隊。至于行政機關的恢復，那不過是去年五月間的事。我們的縣政　建立之後，第二區專署在去年八九月又在雁北成立了×區辦事處，于是　動會，公犧邊區工委會及×區辦事處共同領導　立了雁北的抗×游擊根據地。在它建立之初，×人曾經五次圍攻，企圖將它摧毀，但是勞而無功，反而我們在×人圍攻中更加鍛練的堅强，這則使×人感到不安，於是所謂『搜山』。『勦匪』，『淸鄉』等工作，更加不斷的進行着，不撾，因為它本身力　的不足，担負不起這重大的任務，於是又用『懷柔政策』，「強迫手段』組織了大批的淸鄉隊和僞軍來進　『動匪』的工作。在去年十月間×人第五次搜山活動。幾乎踏遍了我們的整個游擊　據地，但是所得到的是什麽呢。除了重大的打擊之外，更沒有什麽寳貴的　物送給他，不得不使他『乘興而來·收興而返』了。</p>
<p>在×人處心積盧，不斷圍攻的艱難環境之中，它已經度過三個月的時候了。在　短短期間中，是沒有什麼工作可言的。例如吳鎭的×人，白天在鎮子上住，夜間要到距吳鎭四五里的一個山頭上的廟裏去，山陰的×人夜間也要同樣移到牧羊場多面來。在政治工作方面，値得指出的是對十×僞政權的進攻了。為了維　我們的政權，摧毀僞政權，固然要有廣大的游擊隊不　向×人襲擊和擾亂，同時更須加强羣衆工作，提高他們的政　水準，啓發他們　挨意議，使不接受僞政權的統治，僞政權旣沒有廣大的羣衆基礎，是建立不穩的。像在汽車路附近的村子裏，偽政　是可以伸屬到的。同時我們的政權也可以達到，但是我們的政權可以通行無阻，而僞政權則節節發生困難，得不到羣業的擁護；此外，還有許多工作都還待加强：（一）統一戰線作得還不大好，這使工作步調不能一致，不能很好的配合起來；（二）組繳訓練民衆的工作，還嫌不够，各階落的民衆救亡　體，都沒有很健全的組織起來，農救會雖說有相當的成續，但也因為領導的不健全，致沒有更普遍的發展。</p>
<p>為了使這一抗×游擊根據地，健全的，迅速堆成長起來，對于工作方面，都必需作新的計劃和佈這。所以地們根據了當地的環境，更接受了過去工作的經驗和敎訓，而決定了當前的工作：</p>
<p>第一，爲了加强統一戰綫工作，使各團體的力量更加緊密的嗶結和配合起來，由軍政民召組聯席會議，共同研究各種問題，俾集中意見和力量，免生無調的摩擦。</p>
<p>第二，以舊有的自衛隊和農救會作基礎，進行組織訓練民衆，使民運得更廣泛的開展。</p>
<p>第三，組織救濟委員會，發動廣泛的募捐運動，以救濟在×人數次搜山活動中被災被難的民衆。</p>
<p>第四，爲解決峽乏幹部的問題，由動委會，公犧邊區工委會，×區辦事處聯合開辦訓練班，以培養入批工作幹部。</p>
<p>此外還有幾個問題，也値得我們特別注意的：</p>
<p>第一，基幹武裝問題為了使這一抗×游擊根据地成一個抗×的堅强堡壘，相負起消滅×人的任務，這必須有它的基幹武裝；但是這裏所有的武力還不够，還須有更大的力量配在它的周圍。</p>
<p>第二，經濟貿易問題們必需品（如犧食等）的輸入×區，×貨的侵入，以及×人故意提高僞幣價低，降低我法幣和省鈔的價格，企圖擾亂我金融的陰謀，這一些問題，都還沒有解決。</p>
<p>第三，給養問題因為當地機關部隊很多，食親是不能支持長久的，所以對于給養應作有計劃的分配與儲藏。</p>
<p>第四，土匪問題因為在前年這個地區失陷的時候　有小數部隊沒有退出、　據在山裏面，搶掠民衆，日本人去了也打，中國人去了也打，還沒有將他們安撫或勦除。</p>
<p>總之，雁北這一抗×游擊根据地的建立，是有　重大意義的。它的長成鞏固，和擴大，不但是收復　個雁北的基礎，同時，進一步也可以　逐出華北的×人。雖然在目前它還有許多峽點存在　，　有許多問題沒有解决，但這　可以漸　克履的。</p>
<p>看吧！在警北又有一個堅强的堡壘出現了。</p>

<h3>英相作獅吼　維護獨立國家　警告德國勿侵犯但澤　否則英不能袖手旁觀</h3>
<p>張伯倫</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十一日電】首相張伯倫今日在亞兩培大會堂向八千保守黨婦女演說、述及過去一年間世事之變幻，原詞略誌如下：「一年來吾人已遍歷各種情感之階段、直至此　、人民巳一致奢現强硬而堅決之意志、我人自信力量充裕、復覺良心無愧、在過去及現在、吾人已盡人力之所能，以維持世界和平、吾人之目的實屬正確而毫無自私之心、現仍準備聽取別人之意見、但决不受人獨裁、除非我人已認定非加入戰爭則必須犧牲自由及名譽者，任何人均不能誘使吾人參戰、在英國之傳統政策中、從無干預他人之事的企圖、至如德國之行動，如德國一日不因求增進其自身之權益而威脅非日耳曼人種之國家者、則英國一日不視為與己有關、余未嘗有孤立德國或阻碍其向中歐及東南歐擴展其合法之商務權益之心、更從無組織陣綫反對德國而向德挑戰之意、此項推測，荒誕無稽、德國而外、恐冉無致信者矣』、張伯倫氏至是乃將希特勒批評英德海約時之言論引證、希特勒曾謂：『余不願作堅决而肯定之斷語、在我人方面言之、海約之基礎尙未廢棄、反之、兩國人民永不願再度以兵戎相見』、張伯倫繼謂、渠深信英、德兩國人民對於此點期望、同此殷切、而希望兩國政府能妥為調處、務使兩國不再發生戰禍、張伯倫更引述希特勒希望英、德兩國避免擴軍相競之表示、謂英政府對此、將予以縝密之考慮、並準備於適當時間答復德政府云：張伯倫繼曰：『但余請於此時聲明、不論在武備、抑或經濟、吾人均不願與德國進行無拘束之競爭、吾人永不拒絕與德討論增進相互通商或改善經濟情形之方法、但德國必須有切實之表現、使其破產之信約能再度恢復而後可、余願一樣的表示明白、吾人絕不願袖手旁觀、一任獨立之國家相繼被毀、各國要非確信無被侵之危機者、歐洲之安全永無保證之希望、職是之故、吾人乃予波蘭、羅馬尼亞及希臘之保證、亦正為此故、而與其他各國、尤其蘇聯、土耳其進行談判、此種談判尙在進行中、余僅能聲明、在政府方面實切盼此種談判能早日獲得圓滿結果、誠能如此，則和平更可獲進一步之保障矣、若干人士心目中認為、今日之歐洲危機在但澤、而吾人向波蘭所提供之保證、固極為明白與簡鍊者也、吾人固樂意目睹德波糾紛之能以談判方式、和平解决、惟如冀圖以武力更改形勢而致威脅波蘭之獨立時、則歐洲衝突、勢所難免、而我國亦必被捲入漩渦也」、張伯倫繼而論及徵兵問題、謂歐洲大陸國家、曾過分重視英國此舉之意義、『以致此種强烈之反感、使吾人建立和平陣線之努力、亦為之備受艱危，如歐洲因誤解而致戰事爆發、實為一恐怖事件、工黨對於徵兵問題之反對態度、實至不幸、惟此實非其代表國民之公意也、將來如國際緊張局面得稍吿鬆弛、吾人之商務繁榮、亦大有發展餘地、世界各國將皆蒙其利、重建信心之權力、幷不僅在吾人手中、惟吾一息尙存、吾將繼續希望及盡其所能、以重建信心」、張伯倫繼謂、星期三日彼曾獲得機會、與前法總統勃魯姆晤談、據稱、以彼個人及其社會主義友人之觀祭、認為僅有一眞正可以引起歐洲戰禍之危險、『此卽英法兩國、未能推誠合作、及未能信守其諾言之印象　也、如此確成事實、則致命謬誤、莫過於此者矣、」</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>今日之上海！</h3>
<p>今日之上海，甚至包括全部租界，都已陷在日本軍事勢力××××××××下面了！</p>
<p>在武力的刦持與壓迫之下，上海租界當局已經舍棄其「中立」的立塲而採取了爲日方服務的行動，它禁止中國人士懸掛國旗；它取締　文報紙的愛國言論，甚至不准刊登蔣委員長的　詞；它放任日方便衣隊在租界擅捕中國人民；它宣言嚴禁租界內人民　事政治活動，它又下令限制中國人士在租界演說；我們對於租界當局處境之困難，固然要一洒同情之淚，但是對於租界當局之勇於屈服，尤不能不表示遺憾與惋惜，因為對於×××讓步，誰都會憂慮到它本身的未來的！</p>
<p>上海各界同胞，在一切困難，危險，恥辱和恐怖之中，英勇奮鬥已經一年多了！擁護中央，擁護鎮袖，擁護持久抗戰，擁趣統一戰綫，都以上海同胞爲最熱烈最堅决；響應並執行政府領袖任何軍事上政治上經濟上的號召的，也以上海同胞為最熱烈最堅决；精神　動員，國民公約宣誓。反對汪××『反共和平』××××××言論行動，更以上海同胞爲最熱烈最堅决。現在上海同胞竟又進入更艱苦危險的處境！他們的奮鬥是多麽令人同情與崇敬！他們的處境更應該提高大家的警愓！</p>
<p>我們中央對於上海同胞今日的處境是非常關懷的，現在我外交部已向英法領事提出抗議，要求同胞在租界的言論出版自由懸旗自由，這是需要各界共同一致起而擁護以求其實現的，今天報載美聯社華盛頓十二日電，關於上海租界問題，英美巳有合作對日的準備，我們各界領袖和輿論界同人，尤應當仁不讓相率奮起，為政府抗議的後盾，招持及推動友邦輿論、共同努力，以期制日運動進展而正養重見於今日，則受益者當不僅爲上海一隅的愛國同胞而已！</p>

<p>羅旭和爵士演詞略云、自中日歐釁以來，我國同胞、無論在國內國外、皆有種種救國及賑災圑體之組織、其於國家前途、有最大最久之利益者、則莫如工業合作社、蓋其他組織、雖屬重要、但祗屬於治標辦法、而工業合作社之設、則係為一治本大計、國計民生、皆奠基於此、今中國方當抗戰時期百物待用、而外貨輸入、又感受種種困難，兼在上海等處之實業、幾為鋒鏑摧毀殆盡、所以中國如欲競存於世、必須向工業上着力、由此觀之、中國工業合作社之設、確係唯一重要之舉、此工業運動、能解決中國三大問題、（一）利用我國之天然資源、以增進抗戰實力、（二）重新奠定中國實業基礎、以保障利權、（三）對于數千萬流離失所之難民、可以授工藝、為其立安身之根本，且可使國家廣植人材、爲發展實業之原動力、上遠三事、所獲利益、實無限量、現發起人之目的、是求在國內之相當地點籌設合作社三萬所、獨惜現在　門人材缺少、開辦資本不充、未得暢行其志、雖然中央政府、經撥定五百萬元、名為貸款基金、為此舉之資助、但此款祇係為借給各地合作社之用、須於指定時明淸還，不能畏作挹注、且除資本外、還要經常費用、與特別費用、此實有賴於國人與世界人士資助之必要、故吾人今日有此會議舉行、共商辦法、此會議係由香港工業合作社設計委員會所召集、香港之會、係促進此計劃之中心點、經在上海、小呂來、偷敦、紐約、星洲、西貢、八打威等地、設有分值理圑、其任務是担任募捐事宜、與代購應用材料、代運募捐品物，及徵集技術上之獻議、羅致專門人材沸、兼國內外之宣傳義務、</p>
<p>外人多劻助　同胞更應努力</p>
<p>現任主席由愛愛德女士署理、西人贊助者、又有何明華會督、財政司金錫儀之夫人、總醫官司徒永覺之夫人、與覺君夫婦等、各西友皆犧牲不少精神、不少時間、爲中國出力，我中國人目己更應如何努力、無待煩言、且香港在地理上、商業上，與中國有唇齒關係、中國繁榮、則香港繁榮、中國衰弱、則香港衰弱、彼此休戚利書、實不可分離者、務望我同胞戮力同心、一致協助、出財出力、至若宣傳義務、則須多賴報界同胞、居中努力、想報界諸君，向極熱心愛國、必樂于相助、竊以此舉、如得慶成功、則中國不獨可獲光榮之和平、中國之資源可以開闢，中國之實業可以發展、國人生活、可以自給自養、而目前六千餘萬之被難同胞，亦可藉工業技能、自食其力、减輕政府負担、培養國家元氣、此實與民生民族主義兩相符合、足以仰體宣總理之遺志、如此舉不能達到目的，則抗戰期中、所需物事更感缺乏、數千萬之被難同胞、不免失所憑依、而此後中國之財源，亦必為人吸收凈盡、其息不堪設想、所以一利一害、實繁在此工業運動之成敗、其成敗之機、則繫在國人之手、何去何從、我同胞當知自擇云、</p>
<p>中國人物力　動員未嘗遲緩</p>
<p>最後由史諾致詞、略謂中日戰事、多以為中國時至今日、方發動動員令為遲，但以本人意見、則頗不以為然、、蓋日本方面、自出兵後、巳露筋疲力倦狀態、反顧中國則不然、經長期抗戰之下、仍卓有餘裕、卽此已可見一斑、兼之中國於動員令下後、未久即有此　人之進展、孰謂中國動員為晚、律以華軍方而、現下方動員一千萬，民衆之自覺更屬　人、經濟方面、今有此種工業社之創立、更足見中國之抗戰力量，日見加厚、余意以目前中國之動昌問題、應防×利用各淪陷區之原料與人力、凡屬中國民衆、皆應負起此種精神防×之任務、同時對各地民衆及難民之生活問題、亦應設法與以解決、一方面固可增加國防生產、另一方面又可自給、凡此皆興工業合作社之宗旨目的相符、故無論國內民衆與海外僑胞、皆應互助、務使完成此種使命、方能拒禦外侮云、</p>

<p>劇中飾晴雯之李蕙蘭小姐</p>
<p>可是女人們別要激惱她，不，她就悲切地哭起來。你瞧，她哭得越起勁，越激發着寳玉的憐愛心，結果呢？他慢慢的上前温柔地向她陪罪，她破涕爲笑你喜觀撕扇聲嗎？千金買笑有甚聲要緊？』寳玉說着那些詁、晴雯笑喀嘻地把各個扇子撕得粉碎了。（未完）</p>

<p>這張影片的攝製是非常困難的、在中國、喬氏發現他所需要材料是散佈在各處各地方、他每天至少要跑八十多里路、在西班牙、他只要一在馬午里的旅館裏、聽見了砲聲再出發、在一刻鐘之內就可到前線、拿攝影機開拍、但在中國呢、戰場是那麼遼遠、所以常常要費掉一星期的時間才能逢到一段好的材料、「克服台兒莊」這一場大戰的鏡頭、他也是費了許多心血冒了絕大的危險才獲得的、</p>
<p>當今年三月裏這張影片在紐約公映時、曾應新聞記者的邀請、發表了他的工作情形和感想、下面是他報告中的一段、</p>
<p>「……關於中國、許多美國人僅知道它是一塊廣大無根的土地、　看　數飽嘗勞苦的人民而已、因此、我攝製這部影片的第一個目的便是要深入中國內地、帶一些真實的東西回來、讓觀眾們看到中國的真面目、他們的領袖和民眾、以及他們在這次抗戰中的英勇姿態、而把一般人對於中國的浮面觀念一掃而空、我可以相信、我拍攝這部影片並不失敗、觀眾們一定會在本片中看到中國民眾的英勇戰鬥之後而感到驚異的興奮、而將舊有的成見推翻、……這部影片的一切、我都沒有虛飾、我是記錄了真實……、」</p>
<p>附帶要告訴的這張影片的說明是由著名的明星立特瑪區担任的、</p>
<h3>孤島銀訊</h3>
<p>最近滬上電影從業員之躍為新導演者頗多、如新華有王引、陳冀青、國華有鄭小秋、龔稼農等、藝華之李英近亦有「賣花女」劇本呈獻當局、意圖一試、</p>
<p>純古典派美人張翠紅將東山再起、主演吳村編導之「王寶釧」、</p>
<p>最近將在滬上出現之新戲院、除霞飛路杜美路之杜美外、復有人擬租借百樂門飯店二三樓之全部、闢作戲院、曾經一度談判、但恐未許實現、</p>
<p>劉　羣殷秀岑于日前率領新華歌舞組未解散學員、至藝華參觀、時適拍攝方沛霖之「三集化身姑娘」、當由韓蘭根袁美雲殷勤招待</p>
<p>吳村新作「孤島的春天」決改名為「春之狂想曲」、由周璇主演、</p>
<p>戲劇電影從來員之赴內地及香港等處者甚眾、因之滬上電影界之技術及專門人材、頓見缺乏、各公司為謀補救此種恐慌、均、　兩　昔日之助手人員分　印　友其中尤以攝影及　　兩項擢升最多、</p>
<p>滑稽家劉春山、近亦接從事、影之攝製、其劇本經已編就、暫名「無未辦法」近正與某公司接洽代攝、如談判成局、將由劉自導自演、</p>
<p>方沛霖連日趕製「三集化身姑娘」頗見消復、同時「姑娘」袁美雲亦有同樣現象、獨關宏達雖在辛勞之下、體重反見增加、有人乃謂為「肥了一個、瘦了一雙」、</p>
<p>李萍倩之「金銀世界」、製攝過　、下一部新作、為孫敬所編之「生死恨」、係一戀情劇、</p>
<p>王元龍在藝華拍完「燕子盜」後、將赴香港、據說是去拍「美人計」的、緣王元龍從前在大中華雙合公司曾主演過「美人計」默片、王在片中飾演趙子龍、此番當也仍飾此角、</p>
<p>文逸民導演之「神秘夫人」、繼「木蘭從軍」在新光上映、此片為倫理劇、演出很為悽慘、</p>
<p>貂斑華主演「如已」、定十五日開拍、貂近來已日見肥碩、精神良好、故常出現在康腦脫路、</p>

<p>里奧拿在外面遊了四天，到一小旅店里，他發覺陶麗絲已不到家里，連他的朋友梅克也不知那裏去了，回到事務所，書記憂慮的收集了一筆小數目付他的旅館租金，他得悉那個音樂會經理人羅西在找尋他。</p>
<p>羅西能夠給他簽張每星期五百塊錢的五星期合同，上美國斯加拉歌劇院歌唱。時候　司卡伐也要担任主角，第一齣歌劇「流浪人」即刻就要上演了。里奧拿和他的公司都已破產。他雖然不願意，也只得把合同簽訂了。</p>

<h3>足球六大錦標賽之尾聲　看誰奪得旭和杯　南華如勝便完成我華隊包辦錦標之創作　海軍人材濟濟料競爭必烈</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）旭和杯足球决賽、今天下午四時半、在加山舉行、</p>
<p>南華在總會主辨的五項錦標賽中、已取得雙冠軍——甲組聯賽及特別銀牌的榮銜、而其餘三項錦標，亦落在我華隊手裏，如果今天又戰勝海軍，便完成包辦六大錦標的光榮創作了，</p>
<p>猶憶在聯賽决戰中、南華南曾打坍海軍、獲得冠軍、當時的海軍、與今天的或許沒甚差異、而南華此次則從兩隊中選集健將應戰，　理、這番南華未有不　的，</p>
<p>可是現目南華的球人、有多名足部受傷，未能上陣効力、因此、所編的陣綫、不甚完整、故能否取勝、頗成疑間</p>
<p>包辦錦標　大、非比等閒、切望南華諸將、一致努力、莫使功　一　、</p>
<p>照看南華的實力、雖有數名健將缺席、然仍强勁異常、對騰利甚有把握　威不致令人失望的，不過　目下海軍人材齊齊、集精　說，以成一軍，决非易與、休要小　他們、</p>
<p>至其出戰戰馬，尙未　悉　實力如何、難以預斷、南華則選出下列　將、</p>
<p>張榮才　李國威　李天生　謝錦洪　梁榮照　劉慶才　楊水益　郭英祺　馮景祥　葉北華　鄧廣森　譚振輝</p>
<p>（後備員）羅斗文，、林德　、楊根保、</p>
<h3>綱球界為難民請命　今日作義賽　在香港木球會塲舉行</h3>
<p>（籌欵）破天荒之網球</p>
<p>（振）義賽，今日下</p>
<p>（災難）午四時、亦香港木球會場舉行、門票分一元五角及一元兩種、全數所得，撥與英賑會救濟我國災　、全部秩序、俱屬雙打賽、</p>
<p>（宿將）第一　是由德</p>
<p>（遇）孚及高路文與</p>
<p>（新貴）李汝榮及何家流對賽、何李之技術、人多知之、但德高兩人之拍擋、想亦為觀衆所急于一覩者、蓋「手杖先生」德孚為前滬單打冠軍、本屆參加全港公開雙打賽、因合拍非人、半途被淘汰、今日與高路文出陣、相信必有佳妙之表演、蓋高氏不特爲網球名手、而且對于足球一項、亦曾代表　埠際隊，任中　要職、氣力不弱，數年前，與芬渣合拍雙打、與當時得令之林珍兄弟競爭甚劇、其球藝如何、由此可見、</p>
<p>（有綠）第二盤林珍</p>
<p>（再）兄弟對徐氏</p>
<p>（相會）史弟、在本屆公開賽中、林珍兄弟以戰略錯誤、演出冷門，莫克與徐氏兄弟爭錦標、鬱鬱不伸、今日有緣相遇、當大演工夫矣、</p>
<p>第三　德孚及高路文對徐氏兄弟，亦足欣賞、兩徐够活勁、德孚够經驗、必有好鏡頭表現、</p>
<p>（冤家）第四盤李汝榮</p>
<p>（又）及何家流對林</p>
<p>（聚頭）珍兄弟、預料此盤之表演、必為各　中最刺激之一幕、因林珍兄弟心懷報復之念、定必拚命以赴、同時觀衆又可測騐李何一對之堅韌戰法。是否仍然有效、</p>
<p>各盤比賽、有各種花式、豈容輕于放過、寄語球迷、莫顧惜慳囊、化錢賞樂、復行善事、實一舉兩得者也</p>
<h3>南華球塲　發生火警　棚座小部份被焚</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時四十分、加路連山南　體育會場內，突吿火警，幸灌救迅速、不致成災、</p>
<p>本是日下午五時四十分有會員數人、各場內練習俸球、而場內職員、則在會內用晚膳、其時練習棒球之　員、忽見近掃桿埔方面之棚座、濃煙突起，知是失火被焚、、卽通知會內職員、立開水喉灌求、一方面以電話通知中環消防局、該局據報後、卽派出機車一輛前往、同時二號警署聞訊、亦派出大隊警察到場、但抵步時、該被焚處、已為場內中人救熄、然仍焚燬長三百尺、　十尺、損失約在百元左右、</p>
<p>其起火原因、疑為有人放火所致、否則斷不致由棚頂起焚者也、現警探方面，對此在查究中云、</p>
<h3>今夕籃球房　兒女英雄大會戰　事屬義舉……莫措慳囊</h3>

<h3>今日棒球賽　中華逢勁敵　看比香港會究竟誰強</h3>
<p>……【本報專訊】棒球是最用腦的運動，機變奇幻、刻刻不同、如果你是懂得比賽則例的、必點首承認它比任何一項球類運動為奧妙及可觀</p>
<p>……是屆的公開棒球賽會、已在去週揭幕了，先後演出兩齣好戲、給予看客們的新印象，端的不錯、</p>
<p>……今天又來一幕大會戰、是中華對香港會，下午二時半在加路連山海軍場對壘、聽　番港會是屆羅致新手多人，貿力相當强動，不像去屆庸碌無能、今巳陣容一新、</p>
<p>……雖然今天香港會才初次上陣、實力如何、預難估計、須戰事　發後、乃得看個明白、惟從關係方面探來消息、確有幾位來自黃金國的好手、投入該隊效力、所以他們陡起一個雄心、欲爭未　的冠軍、</p>
<p>……很凑巧的，該隊初出便遇着去屆盟主的中華、若果該隊確是强勁、則此戰等於試金石、如於接　之下，有戰勝中華的可能，可怪不得地們雄心　勃了、</p>
<p>……中華去週首次出師、便遭不利、在不應敗的情勢下，竟被岷甸奴打坍、不過此乃偶然的事、它的冠軍聲威、並未因此而受損失、各員如對合作上多下苦功、則無論遇着任何勁敵、都不足懼的。</p>
<p>……如香港會非絕强定不易打敗中華，總之，此幕戰事，是値得一觀的，（太歲）</p>
<h3>菲行瑣記</h3>
<p>— 惠堂</p>
<p>五月四日四比一</p>
<p>羣豉頻催、三　期屆，四視　，不寒而慄。幾經敲研、奇軍突出、排如下列、</p>
<p>譚均幹　李天生　侯榕生　梁榮照　施漢　菲殊寫打　侯澄滔　比路度　大吿　奴　馮景祥　奄巴臣</p>
<p>細視陣綫之離奇、織者早爲之危、然今日材盡于此、雖欲調整加强。亦不可得、比路度調上前綫、實爲創足就　、施漢出任中軍、亦屬迫于輕試，况以多勞之師、以迎冠軍意高、ＹＣＯ無異以卵擊石、孰知天下事有非人料可及者、疇昔兩戰、抱必勝之心而不可勝、今夜則自以爲必敗，而不能敗、『置之死地而後生』、「兩軍對圓哀者勝」、兵法已嘗言之矣、吾人破釜沉舟、竭力作殊死戰，對天氣燈光，已有相當認職、賽來中規蹈矩不若以前之毫無是處、比路度雖無建樹、然施漢則初寫　庭、表演佳絕、爲全場最出色之一員，使人擊節稱善、卒以四比一、初奏凱歌、建功者兩內鋒各一、而大吿則勇拔二城也，得此小　，聊足自慰、奇兵異績、尤喜出望外、賽後菲方以吾隊措施漸趨佳勝，堅邀約為第四賽、我方以征人勞倦、婉詞却之，球戰結果、奇幻英測、今夜之役、又足為一鐵證耳、</p>
<p>碧瑤Baquio　響　饞　、際　時令、菲島小康以人、成多　集，吾人承主　好意、亦于今早驅車　　　、車行幾五小時，始抵　　、沿途林木葱零、山路蜿蜒曲折、下瞰如走長蛇、此地天無、四時皆春、而山光景色、尤足　目暢懷、入境時木牌一面、大書「碧瑤熱烈歡迎你」字樣、後面則為「謝君盛意，盡早囘頭」路中途轉角險處、輒有　語昭示、如「欲求碧瑤安靜、除非多用車掣，少用喇叭』等、頗類美洲某城之路警牌「開慢車可看城市、開快車惟見牢獄』、吾人抵達、略事洌覽、已近黃昏，解衣入浴、頗感瑟細、晚間淸風明月、撩動客思、遠處微聞村內笛聲、轉念故國河山、使人益增怛、擁衾以臥、單毡尤覺不暖也、（未完）</p>
<h3>赴菲所得之教訓</h3>
<p>香港足球隊此次征菲，兩敗一勝，戰績奇劣、原非本身初料所及，消息傳來，尤使港人熱懷冰冷，大失所望，究其主因，實綠吾隊傷病相繼。運蹇遭厄，興乎菲方之熱氣燈光，有以造成之，非敢不盡棉力，長難茍安也、</p>
<p>三戰檢討、能有佳妙表演保持在港水準者、祗均幹、榕生、不過不失者、大吿、施漢、澄滔、老練如景祥、天生、措施亦因環境之遷異、不及在港時佳、榮照，光榮、足疾未痊、眞材未見、餘子碌碌無奇、嚴格啻之、實未足以濟上　、余本人不自警惕、登場傷腿、有負重託、內疚殊深、差幸各友精神飽滿、一圑和氣、旅閒融洽、賓至如歸、而茲番所得敎訓、自有其特殊價値、足為來日征菲任何球隊借鏡者</p>
<p>余意凡欲遣球隊赴菲律濱、亟須注意下列各點、（一）須有一月之準備、嚴格訓練、使球目氣力充沛、蓋港地球藝水準、菲方尙難比擬、苟氣力不虧、當可應付裕如、此次港隊選拔、為時太早，遂使最近演出佳妙之球員、名落孫山、况選出後未嘗有一次正當之試賽、合作毫無把握、英葡諸員、訓練不足、華員則球事撾多、過與不及、兩均不宜，此準備方面之失策也，（二）菲方天氣、週年暑熱，尤以五六月間、爲最難堪、眠食不足、練神萎靡、何能久戰、正二月比較情凉、宜于此時南下、（三）在菲作戰，對方舉動不文、觀衆（指菲人）尤為野蠻、助紂為虐、予人以不良印象，且晚間為賽、更易受傷，客隊應有充分後備六七人、以備不虞、若港隊此番之短于將材、已呈捉婦見肘、窮于應付、兵甲不完，何以制勝、（四）晚戰燈光、低球尙易控制、高球則初試者常感困難、此視綫問題、非有相當時間加以認議、實為客隊最大虧折、港隊第三戰之能左右逢源、未使非由習慣使然、余意客隊抵菲、最好有三四日之燈下練習，然後出賽，則盲撞漏踢、預斷失誤、自可滅少矣、</p>
<p>此外比賽時宜常用低球、以利視綫、及多採長傳、以破敵方慣用之「人看人」守衛法、對球員之食宿、宜有妥適之調劑、熱天嗜飮，勢所難免、惟冰水傷胃、多飲無益、凡茲種種，類皆來日領隊者所官熱知、則事事有備、遷就環境、當不致蹈此番港　　之覆轍耳、誠如聖經所云『我不入地獄、誰入地獄』、是則此次埠際隊之前驅犧牲、能間接造福于後行者、又何傷　、（李惠當）</p>
<h3>籃球會事件　南華上訴得直　聯會判決再訂期決賽</h3>
<p>本月八日晚、公開男子甲組籃球賽、星島以卅一對廿九勝南華後，南華以星島在某次請求更換球員時，南華得紀錄員嗚笛知會、暫停比賽、但星島乘間將球射入、因此兩分致負于星島、故向籃球聯會提出七訴，昨日下午五時、聯會假勝斯酒店召集緊急委員會議、討論解決此事、到會者有　殿　（星島）、劉希文（鐘聲）、謝飛烈（中南）、　照奎（勵行）、馬兆華（華雄）蔡國平（東方）、黎之明（記者）、楊咀華（港大）、電惠明（梅芳）、列席者徐亨、胡正渠、林中　等、主　聯殿廉、録謝飛烈、自由　記宣讀南華　上訴書、繼由該場裁判員　漢烈、旁證劉德禹報吿當時執行職務經邊情形、及各委員互相發表對於此次事件意見、後南華敎練胡止渠、乃提出意見、略謂、蹬以當時記錄員吹用之笛聲、與裁判員所用者無異、故南華球員當時卽根據笛聲而停止動作、若球員不停止而繼積比賽、無　與裁判員作對而陷于犯規、目球員在比賽中，注全神于球上、惟有聽笛聲而定進止云云、至此、各報記者及雙方關係人特槪行退席，由各委員會商討論、　殿廉因代表星島、依　避席、改由　照奎主席，至是、由各出席人員互抒意見、結果决　，南華隊不承認星島隊佔勝二分、備函十訴本委員會，據函依照手續、召開緊急會議、並邀請該場當値裁判檢察，紀錄昌、計時員列席、根據裁判員報吿、謂紀錄員方面、發哨子聲時、球正在進行中、惟紀鈞員方面、謂發出哨子聲時、球在場界外、在觀衆紛亂中、甚難　察當時情形、本委員會　此報吿情形，決難求出確證、因此判星島佔勝之二分取消、雙方續分旣相等。應由該兩隊再行定期比賽、</p>

<h3>向十三個鬥士致敬</h3>
<p>— 拉特</p>
<p>上海是我們全國文化的中心，也是文化鬥士所密集的場听。這有歷年來的　勃的文化事業，有革命鬥爭的浪潮可以給我們證明。這一文化的中心據點，現在縱然是遭着日本法西斯滿　着腥血的脚的踐踏，然而鬥爭的優秀傳統，依然深埋在無數靑年鬥士的心田而起着然熾的抗拒怒潮。任日軍閥及其走狗瓜牙們製造着如何的惡劣環境，噴發着如何的臭腐毒燄，也是不能够消磨靑年鬥士的堅强意志的。這正是「孤島」之所以不成為孤寂的原因；它的周圍正埋　着巨大的火種，它的邊岸隨時可以掀起陣陣的怒浪。戰鬥的現實從不會騙人的，惟其這樣×人對這些愛國志士的鬥爭，十分嫉視，不惜用種種手段，對他們加以迫害。</p>
<p>上海市學生戰時工作隊，在「孤島」上面所煽起愛國運動的熱辣火燄，掀起反日反漢奸的怒潮，自然要給×方認為是「佈的怪物」。而向租界當局提出交涉，要求制止活動了。這些靑年鬥士便在這種惡劣的空氣包圍下，受租界當局監視，逮捕，警吿的種種威脅。現在便有着十三位（四位女性）被中央巡捕房的最後警吿，迫着他們離開了目己的家，烏烟瘴氣的上海而另外踏上他們（她們）的征途。</p>
<p>我們從這十三位鬥士所遭受的痛苦磨難的境况中，才充分的證實了他們會經是為了民族。忘了自己而寫下了英勇的戰鬥生活的一頁，也才充分的證實了他們確是中華民族新生力量的一支生力軍，更才充分的證明了他們跟×寇漢奸已處於極端對立絕不能相容的地位。</p>
<p>他們現在被迫抵港，擬轉赴桂林戰地服務。然而當他們還沒有動程百途的目前，又巳受到絕驪的嚴重打擊了。然而我知道他們並沒有感到痛苦，他們還是從這種不可避免的鬥爭行程中所必然會有的現象，更發出强烈的呼喊，更發着强烈的正義控訴。道使我們愈發起着崇高的。熱烈的敬仰了。</p>
<p>但為着要使我們的熱烈致敬不成為一種形式的，空無所有的示意，我們更需要伸出熱熾的手，把我們可能捐助的物力，來完成這十三位鬥士再上征途的行程。這十三位鬥士就要走了，然而這不是逃亡，也不是避難，而是他們被迫着另換了一個戰鬥的環境，冉度播下他們抗×的火種。朋反們！正確地理解他們，援助他們啊！</p>
<h3>蘇聯女飛行家　（上）</h3>
<p>— 保麗娜·粵雪朋哥作何言譯自莫斯科新聞</p>
<p>奧雪朋哥是蘇聯最著名的女飛行家，她本是貧苦的農家女兒，這裏是她自述的奮鬬史。——譯者</p>
<p>我幼時連做夢也想不到我會做壹個飛行家的，我的童年是消　在烏克蘭的鄉村裏，在聶普洛貝特羅斯克省的諾服斯配索卡的地方。我的父親為着我們的麵包而煩惱，我們的思想都被笨重的農具壓制着。</p>
<p>到了求學的年齡了。我書讀了不久，就為嬰做工幫助家庭而中輟，我的學年是這梯怱怱的過了。</p>
<p>二年級的畢業，僅學會了讀和寫，我就在農場上做工。</p>
<p>一九二四年，我十七歲的那年，我加入了靑年共產黨聯盟。</p>
<p>九二七年，我的家庭加入了集體農場，我也被搖進了社會。</p>
<p>雖然我很幼　，我也分別得出集體農場和我父親，一個可憐的農夫……的田莊的不同。我想，假使我書多讀些，我一定會了解得更多。</p>
<p>不久以後，我們的集體農場收到很多農業學校的入學證，我也請求讀書，就被送到基輔，讀着六個月的家禽畜養課程。</p>
<p>但我上過了第一踝後，我立刻認識我的程度遠　於其他同學，他們都有七年的程度，而我只有二年的學歷。</p>
<p>我要囘到集體農場去嗎？不，我决不，甚至日夜工作，我也要留在這裏。我拚命讀書，我腦子裏充滿着「努力」，但是我成功了，六個月之後，我和其他的同學一起畢業。</p>
<p>於是我貢獻意見給集體農場，在貝登斯克區組織了　個家禽畜驚園，那裏，决定了我的命運。</p>
<p>壹個夏天，來了二架飛機，隆隆的叫聲遮蔽了農場上壹切的聲音，我站在門口，望着，不敢透氣。</p>
<p>飛機降落了，村子裏起了大大的紛擾，每個人，灰白　鬚和搖搖擺擺的都跑到田野裏，看這奇怪的東西，當然我是在這一羣人中間的。</p>
<p>奇怪使我目瞪口呆，我不曉得我看到的是飛機是人我史不相信我的眼睛，在機身的外面，和機師在一起，有一個戴着皮製盔形東西的女人走着。</p>
<p>「哦！女人也能飛嗎？」我問她，我的好奇心勝過了羞怯。</p>
<p>「當然，她們會的。」她大笑着（我後來知道她不是飛行家，是一個看護）。</p>
<p>『你驚嚇嗎？』</p>
<p>『毫不。』</p>
<p>『我知道一個女飛行家在卡科佛，』一個飛行家說。</p>
<p>我回頭聽見，一個女人也能成為飛行家的或者找也能成功，為什麽不呢，我要去，我願意去我堅决的决定了我將是一個，飛行家』。</p>
<p>這中間的一個，我知道是在塞巴期拖堡的航空學校里讀書的。就絕不考慮的寫了一封信給他，我吿訴他在我們村上停下來的飛機，飛機裏的女人和在卡科佛的文飛行家：我並目寫，我也想做一個飛行家，我今年二十三歲，體格健康，是靑年共產黨聯盟的會員，請他能不帮我學習飛行？</p>
<p>他的回信到塞巴斯拖堡來，我們司以確定。</p>
<p>來我去了。</p>
<h3>守夜</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>——壯丁生活的片段</p>
<p>黑暗的夜幕，廣闊地伸展在人底眼前。萬　盡寂的郊野，恬靜得陰森可怖，看不見田隴和村莊，也聽不到人聲和犬吠。舉頭遙望，祇有黑漆的一片；那條沿着鐵路伸展的壕溝，也和地面融合了。</p>
<p>在曠野裏，守夜的壯丁向壕溝行進；路徑雖因黑暗而須要摸索，却什麽也沒有困難。</p>
<p>沿着鐵路摸索，到了壕中，匍匐前行，一霎那聞，就通過了整條壕溝，走釗盡頭；隨着佈崗，守望。</p>
<p>在壕中，意想着一種不停止的侵襲，把前面的山　，茅屋，樹叢，都當作了來夜襲的日機。我們不因在後方，而疏略於防禦；也不因在暗夜，而鬆她於警視；紙有加强的探索。堅守，空間的行雲，稀疏的樹叢，閃爍的幾點燈火。風吹草原的細微聲響。都在我們的心版上，烙，淸晰的印痕。一羣人的勇敢，　定，警察，十足表現出　滿的戰鬥力量。</p>
<p>每個人豎起耳朶，傾聽那沉　裏流迸的夜　，傾聽那高空　自然音樂的牛滅，在這冷肅而凄寂的郊野，雖沒有火花的　裂，但幻念到前綫的戰鬥景象，我們的心就會跳躍起來。</p>
<p>這時候，突然一陣微弱的聲響，由山坳裏傳來。我們用手電筒一射，三個模糊的人影，就立刻映入眼　；迫切地，提高着喉嚨喝問一　口令，那邊不加理會。再接着又喝問一聲『口令』。待我們答出了口令的上文時，那邊又答不出來。而沉默無聲了。</p>
<p>「沒有口令？』一羣人由疑惑而緊張起來，一聳身，跳出　，就跑步包圍過去：許多條手電的光綫，集中在那三個人身上，他們也立刻停止行動，喝問口令：</p>
<p>「最後」——「勝利」</p>
<p>口令喊　了，走近去仔細一望，原來是敎練官　旋　的多謀長，特意來觀察，試騐我們的防較精神的，另一個人就　勸務兵，在敬　之後，敎練官笑　問我們：「如果眞的上，綫守夜，遇到沒有口令的人，你們怎樣歲置？」</p>
<p>『包開，搜查，　械，押送到——。』</p>
<p>敎練官　點頭。繼續笑着說：「最要緊的是：機警和聯絡；視覺和聽覺須控制四方：應該疾進的時候。才跑步；脫離了指揮，也要能够單獨動作。』</p>
<p>回到壕中，站住崗位。又殷切地重温着心裏的期望：我們的力量，也許會有所成就於某一處陣地，而把勝利的愉快充實起來吧？</p>
<p>夜愈深沉，也　黑暗，風也愈大：仰望高空，由於自然　調的逐瀕尖峭，我們就意會到上半夜的時間已過去了。當第二班守夜的壯了，摸索着來　班後，我們雖然踏上了歸途，還是對着壕溝依戀。</p>
<h3>兩個時代</h3>
<p>— 炯裳</p>
<p>在字跡裏，我彷彿看見一片模糊的血跡。在記憶裏那已是久被塵封的往事了。我憧着。腦海裏湧起了一幕不淸晰的幻像。</p>
<p>一年，二年，三年……平凡地逝去了。兩個不同的面孔在森陰的高牆內，也逐漸地消夫了。然而，我想，那是値得驕倣的。</p>
<p>在城西，那　旁，樹下，那遼闊的曠場，那高呼口號的聲譽，那熱烈的演說，那驚人的搶聲，那倒在樹下一堆血泊的男女，凌亂，奔竄，驚懼，恐怖，憤怒………一切，交織成囘憶　一種慰籍，畢竟在不幸的安排　，在沒有自由，沒有新　的氣息的獄牢造了他們的居留地。</p>
<p>第二年，是一天陰　的午後。經過了幾許的艱辛，在那侷促的暗黑的小房閒見到他們，我們痛苦地說些不相干的話，因為門口正立着不少「保護者」（？）。我靜靜在視意那帶來的喜訊，他倆只微微苦笑一下。那印象這麽深刻，我投給他們一個感動的笑，一度光掠過了那兩個瘦削而憔悴的面孔，那沉重的枷鎖。</p>
<p>又是一年，那做了通渡時代不可避免的犧牲者，依然在那平靜的永恒境地；外面的狂風暴雨，一點也吹不進去。給一堵高牆隔絕了，他們不知　，那黑暗的時代已經過去了，</p>
<p>今天，靑運週最後的一天，在這異國旗幟下的島上紀念　的吳月，使我憶起那　　　解放而陷于　中的朋友，然而，時代是不同！一切都在改變了。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『不，我還有工作。』</p>
<p>『你看你的傷太重了。』</p>
<p>『是的我痛了一夜。』</p>
<p>『怎麽重起來了？』</p>
<p>『我想是那天晚上受了　。』他無意地說：『這是紀念呀。』</p>
<p>『你原諒我吧！要不，你冉擅我一刀。』</p>
<p>她撰到他的懷里，哭了。這一哭，使他　了；他不知道把自己怎樣安排任片　間。幸而她自勵地把頭從他的胸前移開。强迫給他換着新的錋　。她不住地說着：</p>
<p>『我希望很快就看見你的傷好！』</p>
<p>然而，有他的一個同志來了，微笑地吿訴他說：</p>
<p>『錢已經如數收到。』又轉向她說：「朱小姐，睛你囘家吧，謝謝你！』</p>
<p>她聽見以後，似乎有些茫然；她一邊繼續給他的頸裏着新的繃帶，一邊！　。</p>
<p>『那個人吿訴什麽？……什麽回家？……』然後，她立刻間雨文：</p>
<p>『是要我回家嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的，你該回家啦！』</p>
<p>於是，她剛剛停止的淚水，又繼續流下了。她那漸潮安靜下來的心情。又被擾得不安了。從昨天，她已被他們的生活祉服，傾心於他們，希望　們給她以　宿。她已厭惡了自已的家庭，尤其是父親。她曾盼待從黑　中轉到光明。而現在，她一度美好的夢想，又將被打得紛碎——　開難捨的他們，獨自寂寞地走囘默惡的家庭；所以她哭着，而目喊叫：</p>
<p>『我不能回家！……不能囘家呀！』</p>
<p>『不對，你該回家去！你聽我吿訴你理由——』</p>
<p>『我不聽，你是一個騙子！！！騙子！！！』</p>
<p>她　着他，駡得很厲害。但她仍在給他裏着棚帶、而且，寡得更加護慎，不　棚　之間遺下一條細　，或是一段脫落的線條。</p>
<p>別的同志，看到這被情景也感覺無法應付地搖起頭來，同時，　等待這　工作快些結束，他們的住址，需要立刻　移。　（六四）</p>

<h3>Intensify Production, Persist in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Li Fuchun</p>
<p>Comrades, we haven't undertaken production movements on a large scale before. Today, we must start implementing them in a planned and large-scale manner. This is our new ×× task that the Party has entrusted to each of us at this moment of welcoming a new stage in the national war of resistance!</p>
<p>Regarding the production movement, we still lack a great deal of experience and achievements to fully explain and substantiate my report. Therefore, I can only provide a summarized and concise explanation and enlightenment based on the instructions of the Central Committee. I hope that everyone will enrich our experience and promote our achievements in the practice of production and in the process of labor in the future.</p>
<p>I. Significance and Purpose of the Production Movement</p>
<p>In today's transition to a new stage of the War of Resistance, we must prepare to overcome all difficulties and overcome all obstacles in order to win the final victory of the War of Resistance. We estimate that the future development of the War of Resistance and the actual situation of the border region will lead to an increase in financial, economic, and material difficulties. Our current task should be to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>To overcome difficulties, we must first rely on our own strength. In other words, we must rely on our own efforts, participate in labor ourselves, and use our own labor to develop our agriculture, industry, and various productions and commercial trade. This ensures that our rear and front lines are supplied with financial, economic, and material resources, unaffected by war damage, and capable of self-sufficiency. The development of the production movement enables our living conditions to be coordinated and consistent with the conditions of war, in order to achieve a smoother development of the future of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, developing the production movement will not only enable us to overcome difficulties and obstacles but also further improve our lives. Comrades, we know that we advocate the thorough realization of the Three People's Principles; we advocate persisting in the War of Resistance to achieve the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Republic of China. This is the national principle of realizing the Three People's Principles. A democratic government has already been established in the border region. Recently, based on the laws of the National Government and the Program for National Reconstruction during the War of Resistance, we have also opened a council representing the entire people of the border region. This is the national principle of realizing the Three People's Principles. Now, we must also develop the production movement to further improve the lives of the people. This is a concrete manifestation of our thorough realization of the principle of people's livelihood of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>Then, our production movement conference today can also be called a People's Livelihood Principle Conference. If we can improve the lives of the people during the War of Resistance, we will definitely be able to carry out the work of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction even better; we will definitely be able to exert the great power of the national war of resistance.</p>
<p>Developing the production movement can solve our future financial, economic, and material difficulties. Not only should the border region, which is a part of our country, do this, but also from a national perspective, we should do this to overcome unprecedented difficulties and strive for final victory. Our border region's production movement should play a promoting and exemplary role in the country; telling the country about our experiences and achievements in developing the production movement, providing guidelines and methods for overcoming difficulties, and greatly developing the production movement throughout the country. This enables the people of the whole country to have a strong confidence in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of national reconstruction—backward rural areas will definitely be able to progress, and the progress and development of the vast rural areas will definitely be able to finally defeat the cities now occupied by × people. This strong confidence is a concrete and necessary condition for us to persist in the War of Resistance, persist in a protracted war, and finally defeat the × people. In short, our purpose in developing the production movement in the border region is as follows:</p>
<p>First, to overcome our border region's financial, economic, and material difficulties, based on the existing material conditions, we must achieve self-sufficiency in agricultural and industrial production of all kinds: further improve the people's lives, and better realize the principle of people's livelihood of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>Second, to promote the national production movement with the exemplary example of our border region's development of the main production movement; to strengthen the confidence of the people of the whole country in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance. To shatter the traitorous Trotskyites' saying: "If the big cities are lost, the economy will be in difficulty, and the War of Resistance will inevitably perish."</p>
<p>Third, in developing the production movement, each of us must participate in physical labor. In terms of ideology, we can change the incorrect view that many people in the past have held of looking down on physical labor. Go to the production front! Closely link theory with practice. In the practice of labor. We can deeply experience the truth of "Labor is sacred."</p>
<p>Fourth, participating in the production movement can strengthen our bodies. In the great national war of resistance, in the protracted and brutal struggle, we not only need correct strategies and tactics to disintegrate and eliminate the × people, but we also need to have strong and unyielding bodies in order to cope with the great disaster of the future. In the practice of labor, we will forge our bodies into steel and iron. When we go to the front line to fight the × people, we will definitely be able to eliminate the ferocious × people in our own hands!</p>
<p>Comrades! How can we achieve our goals? We need everyone to "do it ourselves" in order to accomplish this great and arduous task!</p>
<p>II. Difficulties in Our Development of the Production Movement and How to Overcome Them</p>
<p>We have never done such unprecedented work—a large-scale, fully mobilized production movement. From the actual situation in the border region, difficulties exist. Our difficulties:</p>
<p>First, insufficient labor and uneven labor. The vast number of cadres who came from the ranks of peasants and workers have superior labor. However, many staff members in our institutions and students in our schools have never participated in physical labor, never grown vegetables, and never cultivated the land. Therefore, some organs, troops, schools, and mass groups have strong labor, while others have weak labor. This reveals the phenomenon of insufficient labor or uneven labor. This is the first difficulty in our production movement.</p>
<p>Second, the difficulty of cultivated land. In our border region, the land is vast and the population is sparse. There are vast areas of land, but no one to cultivate them. However, some places have a very concentrated population and lack land for cultivation. For example, in the area within 20 li around Yan'an, there are more than 30,000 people, and there is not enough cultivated land to distribute. This is our second difficulty.</p>
<p>Third, capital difficulty. To develop the production movement in the border region, we must first develop morning agriculture, and then seek the development of industry and commerce. However, because of our insufficient capital, we feel the difficulty of insufficient tools and insufficient draft cattle in agricultural production. As for the industries in our border region, there was no foundation in the past, and commerce has never been very developed. Insufficient capital is our third difficulty.</p>
<p>Fourth, the lack of specialized technical talents. In agriculture, industry, and commerce, we feel that there is a great lack of specialized technical talents, and there are not enough talents to organize and lead large-scale production movements. This is our fourth difficulty.</p>
<p>Fifth, difficulties in terms of time, location, and geographical advantages. In the past, our agricultural production in northern Shaanxi can be said to have "relied on the heavens for food." Since our × Route Army came to northern Shaanxi more than three years ago, because the × people attacked the entire China, northern Shaanxi has become a fortress for the War of Resistance in the Northwest; we mobilized the people of the entire border region to participate in the War of Resistance, and "national peace and people's well-being" was of course out of the question; but, just in terms of agricultural production, it can be said that "the weather was favorable." However, according to what the comrades in northern Shaanxi said, the droughts in northern Shaanxi have a cycle of once every three years and once every five years; there was too much snow last year, and there was not enough rain, and there is a possibility of a drought this year. This is our fifth difficulty.</p>
<p>Are we able to overcome the above five difficulties? Our answer is: we are able to overcome difficulties—we are fully capable of overcoming difficulties!</p>
<p>First, how to overcome the difficulty of insufficient and uneven labor. We can coordinate appropriately when using labor; those with strong labor will plow deep and reclaim wasteland; those with weak labor will fertilize and weed. All Party, government, and military organs, troops, schools, and mass organizations in our entire border region should coordinate with the labor of the vast masses in the border region based on our own labor conditions, and adjust each other. At the same time, the various departments and units of the Party, government, military, schools, and mass organizations should also carry out their own adjustment work, such as logistics personnel, communicators, service personnel, cooks, and horsemen. We can adjust them and save their labor for production; (for example, expanding preparations for students to cook their own meals and pulling the cooks out to farm the land) the work of odd-job men can be replaced by staff or students; I think the first difficulty is likely to be overcome.</p>
<p>Second, how to overcome the difficulty of cultivated land. The adjustment of land and population, requiring appropriate coordination, is more difficult; but. This adjustment work is absolutely necessary. We organize the majority of the large organs, special schools, and mass organizations to carry out the necessary decentralization in an organized and planned manner. The troops can build land and the rear can use the method of "people adapting to the land" to solve the cultivated land problem. This is entirely possible.</p>
<p>Third, how to overcome the difficulty of insufficient capital. If we do not have enough capital, we can carry out a widespread conservation movement and use the money we save to train classes. They have already done this, and the results are very good. Their staff and students, in extremely difficult circumstances, went up the mountains to collect firewood and down the ravines to carry water, saving more than two hundred yuan for production funds. If all the Party, government, and military organizations and departments did this - saving some grain, oil, paper, stationery, etc. Regular and planned production movements for one or two months are not a problem. Comrades! I want to promote our style of arduous struggle and heroic struggle! National industrialists and businessmen are welcome to invest in our border region and develop our border region's national defense economic construction. Our border region government is happy to accept, protect, and reward all production investments that are beneficial to the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>Fourth, how to overcome the difficulty of lack of technical talents. In terms of specialized technical talents to guide agricultural production, on the one hand, we can hire agricultural specialists to guide; at the same time, we must also ask for advice from those old people in ×bei who do not know a single character, because they have practical work experience and are familiar with the actual situation in ×bei. Fan Chi asked to learn about farming. Confucius said: "I am not as good as the old farmer"; the experience of the "old farmer" in ×bei is worth our careful study and development!</p>
<p>Fifth, how to overcome the difficulties in terms of time, location, and geographical advantages. Although natural disasters such as floods and droughts are the power of nature, things are done by people, and human power can also conquer nature. In order to reduce or eliminate droughts, we should pay attention to water conservancy, afforestation, improving production methods, and selecting drought-resistant seeds.</p>
<p>III. Where is Our Guarantee?</p>
<p>We are not only able to overcome the difficulties mentioned above, but we also have favorable conditions for developing the production movement in the border region, guaranteeing the completion of our great production task. Where is our guarantee?</p>
<p>First, the vast masses in the border region are the main force in completing our production tasks; there are two million people in the border region. These two million people have been relieved of the pain of excessive taxes and levies and exploitation under a democratic life. Realizing the principle of people's livelihood, everyone is united around the border region government with one heart and one mind; they will definitely be able to respond to the call of the border region, improve their labor enthusiasm, and complete their tasks.</p>
<p>Second, there are approximately 50,000 people in all Party, government, and military organs and schools in the entire border region who are separated from production; organizing these 50,000 people collectively is a great dynamic force. Everyone is consciously and voluntarily striving for the revolution, and every member of these 50,000 people understands the necessity and importance of participating in the movement of life. We can estimate that: when this dynamic force of 50,000 people. When they step onto the production front on a large scale and unleash their labor firepower, they will surely accomplish their tasks.</p>
<p>Third, the style of our border region is one of arduous struggle; we are Bolsheviks, and enduring hardship and hard work are our daily routine; when we encounter any difficulties, we must fight against difficulties, and we will never surrender to difficulties; this is our revolutionary tradition, and every Party member should carry forward our revolutionary tradition in this production movement to ensure the completion of our tasks.</p>
<p>Fourth, although we have not carried out large-scale production movements in the past, small-scale production movements in individual places have achieved great results; therefore, we have considerable experience in production movements; (such as the rear garrison troops of the × Route Army, security forces, guard battalions, various organs, and various schools who chopped firewood, burned charcoal, raised pigs, planted vegetables, etc. last year) Gather these experiences, organize them, use them as basic experiences, and then develop them; this is the most reliable guarantee for us to complete our production tasks.</p>
<p>IV. Specific Plan for the Production Movement</p>
<p>First, developing agriculture is a central link in our production movement—I have already said that our production movement should develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, but we must take the development of agricultural production as the central link. Because the border region is a relatively backward agricultural area, there is vast land that can be cultivated. Moreover, we can universally mobilize the vast masses and all Party, government, and military organs, troops, schools, and mass organizations to participate in agricultural production to solve our own food problems. Secondly, we must develop the industry of the border region, only because the industry of the border region had no foundation in the past; therefore, we must start with handicrafts and national defense industries. We must develop the commerce of the border region. Only because transportation in the border region is inconvenient and production is not, we must universally develop the cooperative movement to ensure the supply of daily necessities in the border region and to transport the products of the border region out.</p>
<p>Second, specific requirements for developing agricultural production - Since developing agriculture is our central task, we require all two million people in the entire border region and all Party, government, military organs, schools, mass organizations, garrison troops, and security forces to participate in agricultural production and strive to increase agricultural production.</p>
<p>Third, how to carry out the work specifically—planting land and planting grain. The vast masses and the Border Region Council have already discussed in detail and made specific plans in this year's spring plowing movement, mobilizing all two million people in the entire border region to participate in spring plowing, and to achieve:</p>
<p>1. Plan to reclaim 600,000 mu of wasteland this year;</p>
<p>2. Improve seeds;</p>
<p>3. Improve agricultural production tools; improve farming methods - deep plowing, fertilization, and weeding.</p>
<p>With efforts from all aspects, we can ensure that the total grain production will increase by 20% this year. This will guarantee the improvement of people's lives; at the same time, because of the increase in the total production volume, our national salvation public grain can also be increased, guaranteeing the troops who have escaped from production for one year. We can see that the two million people in the border region actively participate in the production movement and complete their tasks under the life of democratic politics. How to mobilize, organize, and lead two million people to complete the task requires the hard work of our Border Region Party Committee, Border Region Government, and mass organizations.</p>
<p>Fourth, key points to pay attention to in mobilizing, organizing, and leading the masses to participate in agricultural production:</p>
<p>1. Governments at all levels must carry out detailed investigation work: a detailed investigation should be conducted on the population, cultivated land, wasteland, draft cattle, agricultural tools, etc.; we must quickly complete this work so that the accurate numbers can be combined with the actual situation for appropriate adjustments, which is what the local government, Party department, and mass organizations should do first.</p>
<p>2. Our mobilization work should be carried out in an educational and enlightening manner, not in a coercive manner; we must conduct detailed explanations and patient persuasion to make every person in the border region understand that we want to improve the lives of the people by developing the production movement.</p>
<p>3. In organizing the labor force of the masses, in addition to organizing the labor of strong men, special attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in production; in the past, not many women in the border region participated in production, and some places even thought that it was a shameful thing for women to participate in production; in this regard, we must carry out a lot of education and persuasion work, especially requiring most of our women cadres to actively participate in the production movement and play an exemplary role. We hope that our cadres in ×bei will do more political work for their wives and mobilize them to go to the production front. Our comrades should use their own exemplary behavior to influence the women of the entire border region. In addition, we should also organize children, the elderly, and families of anti-Japanese soldiers so that they can enthusiastically and actively participate in production. In short, we must organize all the people in the entire border region, regardless of age or gender, into the production movement: this is what is called truly "exerting efforts if they have strength"!</p>
<p>4. Local governments should help the people adjust cultivated land, labor, draft cattle, tools, etc. On the one hand, we can encourage the people to automatically solve problems; at the same time, if the people need the government to help, we should come up with many ways to help them solve problems.</p>
<p>5. Carry out production education work, educate the people, and help the people. Improve farming methods, improve sowing methods, and improve tools, to achieve: All existing cultivated land should be deeply plowed, but the places where deep plowing is carried out do not give up the work of opening up wasteland. To achieve: All newly opened wasteland must be turned twice; but, the places where wasteland is opened up do not stop deep plowing. Regardless of deep plowing or wasteland opening, more fertilizer should be added and weeding should be carried out diligently, so that the productivity of the land can be increased.</p>
<p>6. The staff of the local government agencies should stand in front of the people, actively participate in production, play an exemplary role, and lead the people to move forward by leaps and bounds. Do not "just ask people to do it, but don't do it yourself:", which will have a very bad impact on the people.</p>
<p>7. Implement a broad reward system to greatly improve the labor enthusiasm of laborers. This year, we want to produce thousands of labor heroes. (The border region government has done it in the past, and the results are very good)</p>
<p>8. Strictly implement the work inspection system. In order to complete our production tasks, we must first require all Party, government, and military agencies to take consistent steps, consistent leadership, and constant supervision and inspection: this year, we are preparing to conduct work inspections on the production movement to see whether our work in all aspects can be gradually realized in accordance with the production plan.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the participating senators, responsible comrades of the Border Region Party Committee, the Border Region Government, and the mass organizations will study these points of view in detail and apply them appropriately to specific work.</p>
<p>Fifth, those who have left production must also produce - All Party, government, and military agencies, troops, schools, and mass organizations that have left production must participate in production. Here, I would like to raise the following specific tasks and ask the responsible comrades of the Party, government, and military organizations to pay close attention to them and implement them with reference:</p>
<p>1. The distribution of production tasks to Party, government, and military organizations:</p>
<p>Border Region Government and below: 16,500 dan</p>
<p>Military agencies, schools: 12,500 dan</p>
<p>Central agencies and directly affiliated schools: 1,000 dan</p>
<p>2. Explanation of the production tasks below the border region level: In the border region, we plan to complete 16,500 dan of fine grain below the border region level (approximately 30,000 dan of rough grain). Although this number is large, it is not a problem to complete it. Of course, the completion of this plan requires our cadres and comrades at the border region level, especially the security forces of the entire border region, to complete it with a fighting spirit. In this regard, attention should be paid to: the adjustment of land and labor, a detailed investigation and concrete understanding should be conducted on how much land and wasteland a certain step has, and on the fertility or barrenness of the soil in the base county. For example, there is less grain production in the three border lands, and there is more grain production in the ring land. Geographical conditions are very important for agricultural production, and the entire border region cannot be averaged. Attention should also be paid to: cooperation with the vast people and obtaining the help of the vast masses in the work. This is a necessary condition for completing the production task. Why is it necessary for the Party, government, military, schools, and mass organizations below the border region level who have escaped production to complete the food to achieve self-sufficiency? Our reasons are: (1) The comrades below the border region level have the most experience in agricultural production, especially the labor force of the security forces in the entire border region is the strongest. (2) The comrades below the border region level are the easiest to get close to the masses. They can not only help the masses promote the production of the masses, but also obtain the help of the vast masses. (3) The Party, government, and military organizations below the border region level are scattered throughout the border region, and they do not have the difficulty of insufficient land and uneven manpower. (4) Most of the comrades below the border region level are comrades from northern Shaanxi. Not only are they suitable for the people and the land, but in the past ten years of revolutionary struggle, they have been the most full of the spirit of arduous struggle. With these four reasons, I think that our comrades at the first level can not only complete the task, but even exceed the task.</p>
<p>3. Explanation of the production tasks of military agencies, schools, and the × Route Army garrison troops: Our requirement for the military is to complete 12,500 dan of fine grain (equivalent to 25,000 dan of mixed grain). This number is not large, because the number of people in the military is quite large, and the labor force is also quite strong. I think: under the basic policy of not hindering learning and not hindering work, carry forward the style of Kangda—we are the vanguard of the workers!" There is no problem for them to complete the task.</p>
<p>4. Explanation of the production tasks of central agencies and directly affiliated schools: For the agencies and schools directly under the Central Government, we require the completion of 1,000 dan of fine grain. Although this number is not large; on the one hand, because the number of people is small, and on the other hand, because the labor force is small, according to our estimation, the completion of the task of 1,000 dan of fine grain still requires great efforts from our comrades below the central level.</p>
<p>Sixth, about the problem of planting vegetables - We require all Party, government, and military organizations and all food units to universally carry out the vegetable planting campaign. (Planting horse feed in passing) In the future, no matter which part it is, it must be able to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables, and it must also be able to eat more vegetables. We are preparing to universally reduce the vegetable money starting from July, and the reduction standards are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Those who originally paid seven points will be reduced by four points and issued three points.</p>
<p>2. Those who originally paid five points will be reduced by three points and issued two points.</p>
<p>3. Those who originally paid four points will be reduced by two points and issued two points.</p>
<p>4. The original number of troops is generally reduced by only one point.</p>
<p>Seventh, about the production of agricultural by-products - According to the existing strength, various agencies, troops, and schools should feed pigs and sheep themselves, and raise pigs to improve their own lives; we feed the pigs so fat and raise the sheep so fat, everyone eats a few more meals of meat a week, I think everyone will not disapprove, right?</p>
<p>Eighth, about industrial production - Because we had no industrial foundation in the border region in the past. At present, we can only start with handicrafts and national defense industries:</p>
<p>1. In the future, our problem of clothing will become more and more difficult, we must build large textile factories and develop the organization of household handicrafts. So that our clothing problem can be properly solved.</p>
<p>2. Start to establish a preliminary national defense industry; mining coal mines, expanding oil factories and paper mills, increasing salt production, and opening small-scale manufacturing plants for other daily necessities and military supplies.</p>
<p>3. Establish a natural science research institute.</p>
<p>4. Encourage private enterprises and private investment, and help the people develop various handicrafts.</p>
<p>Ninth, about the development of commerce - The universal development of the cooperative movement is a necessary condition for improving the lives of the people, but private business should also be encouraged:</p>
<p>1. In the future, cooperatives in various parts of the border region should ensure that the people enthusiastically join, so that these cooperatives become the cooperatives of the vast masses themselves. Become a tool to improve the lives of the people.</p>
<p>2. The cooperatives of various organizational departments should be unified. The cooperatives of various Party, government, and military departments should each have their unified leadership in order to achieve the effect of directing one's arms and fingers. The cooperatives of the troops should be unified under the supply department of the garrison troops; the cooperatives of the people in various places should be unified under the overall construction leadership of the border region government; the cooperatives of the central agencies and directly affiliated schools should be unified under the Central Finance and Economics Department.</p>
<p>3. Points to pay attention to in running cooperatives: (1) The revenue and expenditure accounts must be clear; (2) Adjust materials, do not "stock up on scarce goods"! (3) When distributing dividends, a portion of the funds should be set aside for the development of the cooperative. (4) Be able to supply the things and daily necessities that the public needs. To achieve improving life.</p>
<p>4. Regarding private business; in order to develop the commerce of the border region, the border region government should protect and encourage private commerce. However, it is necessary to prevent profiteering and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japanese Intimidation of England</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo yesterday, the "Kokumin Shimbun," the organ of the Japanese military, published an article yesterday threatening the personal safety of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The article stated that Kerr's activities in Chongqing were deliberately strengthening British aid to China's resistance against Japan. It further falsely accused the British Ambassador of using his position to protect Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. Finally, it warned: "If he continues to provide secret assistance and abuse his diplomatic privileges in the future, Japan will not be able to guarantee his safety."</p>
<p>This is not only a problem for the British Ambassador personally, but also an intimidation of England in reality. On the other hand, it is an insult to our supreme leader and our sacred war of resistance. We truly lack the courage to remain silent regarding such remarks. First of all, we must declare that we are determined to fight heroically and sacrifice valiantly to achieve final victory in our sacred resistance against Japan. We do not need to resort to base means. Our supreme leader's upright actions do not require the protection of foreign "diplomatic privileges." Facts speak louder than sophistry. The reason former British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was strafed was because the Japanese suspected that important Chinese officials were traveling with him. But what was the result? Furthermore, the bombing of the American "Panay" by Japanese aircraft was also motivated by the same intent, and its result only proved the fear and incompetence of the aggressors. In fact, it is the aggressors, not us, who are using foreign protection. The Japanese planes repeatedly This is something that only the invading Japanese themselves know clearly! Moreover, Japanese goods are everywhere falsely labeling themselves with foreign trademarks for sale in the world market, even falsely claiming to be Chinese goods and dumping them in our country's markets. Is there anything in the world that surpasses this?</p>
<p>However, here we want to conduct a review and judgment of the aggressors' view of Sino-British relations. Not long ago, exhausted from the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese indeed intended to seek peace. They requested England to mediate, but the British Ambassador, who knew our country best, did not accommodate their request. Therefore, the militaristic warlords of Japan harbor resentment towards them. At the same time, Japan believes that England's Far Eastern policy cannot be shaken in the slightest. Therefore, recently, on the one hand, they have launched an anti-British movement, and on the other hand, they have greatly intimidated England. The "Kokumin Shimbun" often publishes editorials discussing Sino-British relations, believing that in order to ensure its interests in China, England will continue to aid China's resistance against Japan. At the same time, they have also deeply believed in our conviction to resist to the end. They predict that we will definitely resolutely carry out mountain warfare in Chongqing to the end, even if it means scorching Guilin. They also assume that even if Kunming and Chongqing fall, our supreme leader will definitely not yield. They believe that the "strength" of the "Chiang regime" lies in (1) the spiritual sympathy of England, France, and the Soviet Union, (2) diplomatic assistance, and (3) the transportation of weapons; and that this assistance will become more active in the future.</p>
<p>The Japanese have fully exposed their "fierce appearance but weak inside" to this point. They mock: England and France have already fully tasted the "bitter cup" of Germany and Italy, and England and France will no longer dare to taste a larger "bitter cup" in Asia. However, they have never dared to join the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance strongly demanded by Hitler, or at least not dare to offend England and France openly. Recently, they even ordered their ambassador to England, Mamoru Shigemitsu, to take advantage of the eventful situation in Europe to carry out diplomatic adjustments with England. The Japanese have repeatedly bowed down to the Soviet Union, which has a tough attitude. It is not difficult to imagine how England should deal with such a "fierce-looking but weak-inside" country.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Navy Suddenly Occupies Gulangyu, Further Threatening the Shanghai Concessions. A Traitor on Gulangyu is Shot by an Unidentified Assailant. The Japanese Army Uses Pretext of Protecting Overseas Chinese to Land Sailors, Meeting No Resistance.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 12th] Japanese sailors landed on Gulangyu today. A Japanese report claimed that while a senior Japanese naval officer was inspecting the area, the chairman of the pro-Japanese Chinese Chamber of Commerce was assassinated. Therefore, the Japanese Navy took the action of landing to protect the naval officer and assist in the investigation of the murderer. The status of Gulangyu is almost the same as that of the Shanghai International Settlement. Currently, there are no foreign troops stationed there, only one British destroyer is anchored there. The nearest American warship is in Shantou. A Japanese Navy spokesman told reporters today: "If a similar serious incident occurs in Shanghai, the Japanese Navy will take similar necessary actions in the Shanghai International Settlement."</p>
<p>[Xiamen, 12th] According to a dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the landing of Japanese naval landing forces in the Gulangyu Concession was because a certain Hong, the chairman of the puppet Xiamen Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was assassinated in the Gulangyu Concession yesterday morning. It is reported that Hong was walking on Nantou Road in Gulangyu at 11 o'clock yesterday morning when he was suddenly shot by an unknown assailant. Hong was shot several times and seriously injured. He was immediately taken to the Salvation Army Hospital in critical condition. Afterwards, the Japanese naval landing forces immediately landed, taking control of various key locations. The Japanese commander in Xiamen then issued a statement expressing "deep concern" about this "terrorist incident," saying that the Japanese Consul-General had notified the concession authorities in advance that the commander of the Japanese fleet and his staff would come to Gulangyu Concession to inspect, and Hong was accompanying the Japanese military inspectors. "Now that he has been assassinated, it is deeply regrettable, and we should pay close attention to it." The statement even stated that the landing of the Japanese naval landing forces was a "self-defense action" to protect the lives and property of the Japanese people, and claimed that the Japanese side had repeatedly requested the concession authorities to pay attention to the Chinese "plainclothes teams" and "unstable elements" secretly coming from the mainland, but the concession authorities showed "unfriendliness." The statement also stated, "The Japanese military's landing is entirely to eradicate anti-Japanese activities," ordering citizens to continue their business as usual and not to be alarmed, and warning against fleeing to other ports, otherwise, they will be regarded as "unstable elements" escaping and punished accordingly.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] The Japanese here claim that the Japanese military dispatched troops to occupy Gulangyu, a public concession near Xiamen, on Friday because the concession authorities could not suppress the anti-Japanese movement. The Japanese military's move was entirely for self-defense, attempting to eliminate the anti-Japanese organs in the concession. It was also said that since the Japanese military occupied Xiamen last year, Gulangyu has become a center for anti-Japanese movements, which led to the assassination of the chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce last Thursday. This case is the "main reason" for occupying the concession. It was found that when the Japanese military entered the area, there were no accidents. Several foreign warships were anchored nearby. Gulangyu is a small island opposite Xiamen, with a population of 50,000, including about 250 foreigners. Furthermore, people from various countries here are paying close attention to the Japanese military's move. According to Chinese political circles, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, this is the first time that a public concession stipulated by Chinese and foreign treaties has been occupied.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Yesterday, Thursday, Hong Liesheng (transliteration), chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, was shot and killed by several Chinese assassins inside. The assassins escaped. The next day, the Japanese naval landing forces used the pretext to dispatch troops to occupy the Gulangyu Concession. Hong was a well-known pro-Japanese figure.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Association Cables the United States, Calling for a Halt to Weapon Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Japanese warlords are conducting unprecedentedly barbaric bombings in various parts of our country, and their weapons mainly come from our friendly nation, the United States. The Chinese National Diplomatic Association recently cabled Mr. Henry Stimson, Chairman of the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression,</p>
<p>expressing our country's determination to resist the war, and deeply hoping that the United States will strengthen its actions to resist the aggressor countries. The original cable translates as follows: Japan is carrying out unprecedentedly barbaric bombings of Chinese cities and residents, and its weapons mainly come from our friendly nation. This kind of cowardly murder can only strengthen our determination to resist the war. At the same time, we deeply believe that this will also strengthen the efforts of our friends to resist the aggressors. The Chinese National Diplomatic Association.</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Nelson T. Johnson Returns to China to Resume His Post</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] According to Shanghai news, American Ambassador Nelson T. Johnson left the United States for China on the 1st.

<h3>Shanghai Assassination Case: A Staff Member of the Puppet Ministry of Communications Dies from a Sharp Blade. The Assailant Distributes Pamphlets and is Unfortunately Arrested.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 12th] Pan Chengdong (transliteration), an official of the puppet Weixin government's Ministry of Communications, was stabbed to death with a sharp blade in the French Concession tonight. Shortly afterwards, the assailant was arrested while distributing anti-Japanese pamphlets.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Shanghai is Unprecedentedly Serious. England and the United States Study Countermeasures. The Two Countries Prepare to Jointly Respond to the Demands Made by the Japanese Army to the Shanghai Municipal Council.</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] This agency's reporter has learned from non-official sources that the British and American authorities are currently working together to prepare a formal response to Japan regarding the recent demands made by the Japanese army to the Shanghai Concession. Sources close to the State Department said that the State Department is studying the Shanghai issue and its situation separately and will exchange views with England before taking any action. The future response to Japan will be largely the same in wording as England's response. Well-informed sources said that the current Shanghai Concession issue is the most serious since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, non-official sources believe that Japan's recent refusal to form a military alliance with Germany and Italy has greatly benefited US-Japan relations. However, if Japan insists on its own way on the Shanghai Concession issue and is unwilling to compromise, the goodwill between the US and Japan will be lost again. Furthermore, observers predict that if Japan intends to take "drastic action" against the Shanghai Concession, it would be tantamount to indirectly supporting the "economic sanctions against Japan" proposal by the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If the proposal is passed, most of Japan's war materials would be cut off.</p>
<h3>A British Merchant Ship in Shanghai's Huangpu River is Damaged by Fire.</h3>

It was found that the ship had been sailing from Colombo to Shanghai, and a fire had occurred in a cargo hold on board during the voyage. The crew spent four days extinguishing the fire. When the second incident occurred yesterday, the port fire brigade immediately rushed to tow and rescue the ship, and the fire was extinguished. The ship is leased by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and is carrying 7,000 tons of coal. It is reported that the losses are minimal.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Kuo Speaks in England: Resistance and National Construction.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Chinese Ambassador Kuo Tai-chi said in a speech at the annual banquet of the Oriental Institute last night that all countries in the world have recognized that our country is resolutely resisting the war, enduring hardships unprecedented in history, but also rebuilding international justice and integrity. From our national perspective, our country is currently building a "China within China," developing the southwestern provinces, and building transportation routes with Myanmar, Vietnam, and the Soviet Union. This development will allow China to have more direct relations with other parts of Asia.</p>

<h3>Massive Shipment of National Tea to Hong Kong to Exchange for Foreign Exchange and Enhance National Power. The Situation in Zhejiang is Tense, Making it Difficult to Bring Tea to Hong Kong. The Soviet Union and We Establish a Purchase Agreement.</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Since Shanghai's tea leaves have been concentrated for export, and since the fall of Shanghai, the entire market has shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All foreign trade is designated by our government, controlled and purchased by a certain company, and concentrated for export from Hong Kong. The new tea of this year has been successively shipped to Hong Kong from the mainland. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>New Tea from Various Places Begins to Enter the Market.</h3>
<p>Zhejiang, Wan, and Jiangxi provinces are the production areas of red and green tea, with considerable annual output. In recent years, after improvements, foreign sales have been good. Now, the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang Province, such as Hangzhou, Pinghu Dongting Mountain, etc., have been occupied. In other areas, such as Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou, Wenzhou, Pingshui, and Suian, the new tea produced this year has successively entered the market. In the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, except for a part that has been occupied, the remaining production continues as usual. Therefore, the output of tea leaves this year will not be reduced. They are now being successively shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Government Controls and Concentrates Exports from Hong Kong.</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance and the Trade Commission implemented centralized control over the transportation and sales of tea leaves last year, exports have surged. This year, the export trade of tea leaves is still under the control of the government. The Fuhua Company is designated to purchase in various production areas and concentrate exports from Hong Kong according to last year's method. Members of the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association and tea firms have set up offices in the production areas and Hong Kong. Various foreign firms are also purchasing directly in Hong Kong for foreign transportation.</p>
<h3>Tea Leaves Shipped to Shanghai Must Settle Foreign Exchange.</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance Trade Committee unified tea leaves, it immediately established a platform with the Soviet Union. It was stipulated that tea from all places must be purchased in large quantities and transported by the Fuhua Company, but tea shops are only allowed to transport tea to Shanghai for domestic sales, but they must sell foreign exchange in accordance with the law. Foreign tea from foreign firms, except for raw tea that must be requested for approval in advance, the other範茶 absolutely prohibits transporting to Shanghai. Furthermore, this year's Zhejiang tea is feeling difficult due to the tense situation in Zhejiang affecting transportation. The tea produced in Anhui and Jiangxi has been concentrated in Zhejiang and Guangdong for transshipment to Hong Kong for export.</p>
<h3>Establishing the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base in Yanbei</h3>
<p>— Tan Feng · Qiao Li</p>
<p>[Minsheng West Communication] In the northern part of Shanxi, there is an inner city of the Great Wall, intermittent and winding, following the Hengshan Mountain and the Hongtao Mountain, passing through Pingxingguan and Yanmenguan, climbing over Yangfangkou, and heading northwest directly to the border of Suiyuan, where it meets the outer city, horizontally cutting off northern Shanxi. This vast land, divided, is four to five hundred li from east to west and two to three hundred li from north to south. It includes thirteen counties, including Tianzhen, Tanggao, Guangling, Lingqiu, Hunyuan, Datong, Huairen, Yingxian, Shanyin, Shuoxian, Zuoyun, and Youyu. Because it is located north of Yanmenguan, it is collectively referred to as Yanbei.</p>
<p>Yanbei is almost surrounded by several large mountain ranges such as Hengshan, Guan Cen, and Hongtao. The climate is cold and unpredictable. There is a children's rhyme in this area: "The wild people outside Yanmenguan wear fur coats in the morning and gauze in the evening, and there is also a strange thing, holding a stove and eating watermelon." We can imagine how cold and changeable the climate in Yanbei is. Due to the various relationships of land, transportation, and climate, the poverty and backwardness of this place have been determined. Generally speaking, people's lives are very poor. Agricultural products are mainly millet and potatoes. Followed by sorghum and wheat. Wheat flour is already a top-grade food here. Because of the small production, it is partially dependent on the counties within the pass. Millet is the food of the Chinese people. Because the local yield is very large, ordinary people use it as the main food, and sorghum is only for the poor. The grain produced is still self-sufficient. Industry is not very developed. Factories are concentrated near Datong, such as the mining bureau for coal mining, Baojin Company, Flour Company, Alcohol Company, etc. However, after Datong was occupied by the Japanese, the entire industry of Yanbei can be said to have been completely destroyed. There are also rich coal mines here. Datong, Huairen, Hunyuan, Zuoyun, Youyu, etc. all have production. Salt is also produced in the Shanyin, Yingxian, and Huairen areas. In addition to supplying the counties in Yanbei, a large amount is also exported to Suiyuan and the counties within Yanmenguan. As for culture and education, it is backward in this area, which is determined by the backward economic conditions. We can say that Datong is the economic and cultural center of Yanbei. The fall of Datong has destroyed the economic and cultural foundation of Yanbei. After the fall of the entire Yanbei and the ravages of the Japanese iron hooves, everything backward has been completely destroyed! Therefore, we can know that the anti-Japanese guerrilla base established in this backward area must not be very complete due to the limitations of the difficult environment in the early stage of its establishment. However, under the leadership and struggle of the General Mobilization Committee, the Public Sacrifice Border Region Working Committee, and the Second Commissioner's Office and the Administrative Office, it is gradually moving forward.</p>
<p>This newly established anti-Japanese guerrilla base is located in the center of Zuoyun, Youyu, Datong, Huairen, Shanyin, Daiyue, Shuoxian, and Pinglu, about two hundred li long from north to south and more than one hundred li wide from east to west. It is surrounded by the Japanese on all sides. However, first, we have a considerable amount of troops here, such as the Sixth Detachment of the Second District Security, the Sixth Regiment of the Garrison, the Chahar-Suiyuan Guerrilla Army, and the Cadre Training Brigade, etc., which can be said to have more power than the Japanese, and they dare not easily invade. Second, the Japanese troops are not adequately equipped. In addition to the troops stationed in the towns they occupy, they cannot rule the vast territory. Although we do not know the exact number of Japanese in Yanbei, generally speaking, there are often three to four hundred Japanese stationed in Datong, Zuoyun, Youyu and other counties. As for Daiyue, Wuzhen and other places, there are only thirty to forty Japanese. This weak force makes them dare not leave the occupied areas to invade us. Third, the broad masses support and help us. This is a great power that the Japanese cannot overcome. Because of the above three reasons, our anti-Japanese guerrilla base has been established and grown up in the encirclement of the Japanese, and the Japanese can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>If we want to know how this new anti-Japanese guerrilla base being established was established in the encirclement of the Japanese and in the harsh environment, then we cannot but look back to the past: it was in mid-September of the year before last, when the Japanese invaded Datong from Tianzhen and Yanggao. At the end of September, they forced Yanmenguan. At that time, the counties had been lost one after another, and the administrative organs and troops had also retreated. The only organizations left here were a few groups leading the people's movement. They struggled in the difficult environment and developed a large number of guerrillas. As for the restoration of administrative organs, it was only in May of last year. After the establishment of our county government, the Second District Commissioner's Office established an Administrative Office in Yanbei in August and September last year. Therefore, the General Mobilization Committee, the Public Sacrifice Border Region Working Committee, and the Administrative Office jointly led the establishment of the Yanbei Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base. At the beginning of its establishment, the Japanese launched five encirclements and suppressions in an attempt to destroy it, but they were in vain. Instead, we became stronger in the Japanese encirclements and suppressions, which made the Japanese feel uneasy. Therefore, the so-called "mountain search," "bandit suppression," and "village clearing" activities were carried out more and more continuously. However, because of its own lack of power, it could not bear this major task. Therefore, it used "appeasement policies" and "coercive measures" to organize a large number of village clearing teams and puppet troops to carry out the work of "suppressing bandits." In October last year, the Japanese launched their fifth mountain search operation, which almost swept through our entire guerrilla base area. But what did they get? Apart from heavy blows, they did not get any valuable things to give him, and he had to "come happily and return disappointed."</p>
<p>It has been three months since it had passed through the difficult environment of constant encirclements and suppressions from the Japanese. In such a short period of time, there is not much work to be done. For example, the Japanese in Wuzhen live in the town during the day and go to a temple on a mountain four or five li away from Wuzhen at night. The Japanese in Shanyin also move to the pasture on the other side at night. In terms of political work, it is worth pointing out the attack on the puppet regime. In order to maintain our regime and destroy the puppet regime, we must not only have a large number of guerrillas constantly attacking and disturbing the Japanese, but also strengthen the work of the masses, improve their political standards, and inspire them to oppose the pseudo-regime. The pseudo-regime has no broad mass base and cannot be established stably. Like in the villages near the highway, the pseudo-regime can extend to it. At the same time, our regime can also reach it, but our regime can pass unimpeded, while the pseudo-regime has encountered difficulties one after another and cannot get the support of the masses. In addition, there are many tasks that need to be strengthened: (1) The united front work is not done well enough, which makes the work steps inconsistent and cannot be well coordinated; (2) The work of organizing and training the masses is not enough. The national salvation organizations of all classes have not been organized very soundly. Although the peasant association has made considerable achievements, it has not been developed more universally due to the unsound leadership.</p>
<p>In order to make this anti-Japanese guerrilla base sound and grow up quickly, new plans and deployments must be made for the work. Therefore, we have decided on the current work based on the local environment and the past work experience and lessons:</p>
<p>First, in order to strengthen the united front work and make the power of various organizations more closely united and coordinated, a joint meeting of the military, government, and people will be convened to jointly study various issues, so as to concentrate opinions and forces and avoid unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>Second, based on the existing militia and peasant associations, organize and train the masses to make the people's movement more widely developed.</p>
<p>Third, organize a relief committee and launch a wide-ranging fundraising campaign to relieve the people who have been affected by the Japanese mountain search activities.</p>
<p>Fourth, in order to solve the problem of the lack of cadres, the Mobilization Committee, the Public Sacrifice Border Region Working Committee, and the Administrative Office will jointly run training classes to train a batch of working cadres.</p>
<p>In addition, there are several issues that deserve our special attention:</p>
<p>First, the problem of backbone armed forces. In order to make this anti-Japanese guerrilla base a strong fortress for anti-Japanese resistance and take on the task of eliminating the Japanese, it must have its backbone armed forces. However, the armed forces here are not enough, and more powerful forces must be deployed around it.</p>
<p>Second, the problem of economic trade. The import of our necessities (such as food) into the occupied areas, the invasion of Japanese goods, and the Japanese's deliberate increase in the price of pseudo-currency and the reduction of the price of our legal tender and provincial banknotes in an attempt to disrupt our financial conspiracy, these problems have not been resolved.</p>
<p>Third, the problem of supplies. Because there are many local organs and troops, food cannot support for a long time, so supplies should be distributed and stored in a planned way.</p>
<p>Fourth, the problem of bandits. Because when this area was lost the year before last, a small number of troops did not withdraw, and they occupied the mountains, looting the people. They fought the Japanese when they came, and they fought the Chinese when they came. They have not yet been appeased or suppressed.</p>
<p>In short, the establishment of this anti-Japanese guerrilla base in Yanbei is of great significance. Its growth, consolidation, and expansion are not only the foundation for recovering the entire Yanbei, but also, further, can drive out the Japanese from North China. Although it still has many shortcomings and many problems have not been resolved, these can be gradually overcome.</p>
<p>Look! Another strong fortress has appeared in Yanbei.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Roars Like a Lion: Defending Independent Nations, Warning Germany Not to Invade Danzig, Otherwise Britain Cannot Stand By</h3>
<p>Chamberlain</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech to 8,000 Conservative women at the Earl's Court Auditorium today, describing the changes in world affairs over the past year. The original words are recorded as follows: "Over the past year, we have gone through various stages of emotion. Until now, the people have unanimously shown a strong and firm will. We are confident that we have sufficient strength and feel innocent. In the past and present, we have done our best to maintain world peace. Our purpose is correct and selfless. We are still prepared to listen to other people's opinions, but we will never be dictated to by anyone. Unless we have determined that we must sacrifice freedom and honor if we do not join the war, no one can induce us to participate in the war. In the traditional policy of Britain, there has never been an attempt to interfere in other people's affairs. As for Germany's actions, if Germany does not threaten non-Germanic countries in order to increase its own interests, Britain will not regard it as related to itself. I have never attempted to isolate Germany or hinder its legitimate business interests in Central and Southeastern Europe, nor have I ever organized a front against Germany to challenge it. This speculation is absurd. No one but Germany would believe it." At this point, Chamberlain cited Hitler's remarks when criticizing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Hitler said: "I am unwilling to make a firm and definite judgment. As far as we are concerned, the basis of the Naval Agreement has not been abandoned. On the contrary, the people of both countries will never want to meet each other again on the battlefield." Chamberlain continued, saying that he deeply believes that the people of Britain and Germany share this expectation, and hopes that the governments of both countries can properly mediate so that no more wars will occur between the two countries. Chamberlain further quoted Hitler's expression of hope that Britain and Germany would avoid expanding their armaments in competition, saying that the British government would give this careful consideration and would be prepared to reply to the German government at an appropriate time. Chamberlain continued: "But I would like to state at this time that, whether in armaments or in the economy, we are unwilling to engage in unrestricted competition with Germany. We will never refuse to discuss with Germany ways to increase mutual trade or improve economic conditions, but Germany must have concrete evidence to show that its bankrupt promises can be restored. I would like to express myself clearly that we will never stand by and watch as independent countries are destroyed one after another. There is no hope of guaranteeing the security of Europe unless all countries are convinced that there is no risk of being invaded. For this reason, we have given guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Greece, and for this reason, we are conducting negotiations with other countries, especially the Soviet Union and Turkey. These negotiations are still in progress, and I can only state that the government sincerely hopes that these negotiations will achieve satisfactory results as soon as possible. If this can be achieved, peace can be further guaranteed. Some people believe that the current European crisis is in Danzig, and our guarantees to Poland are extremely clear and concise. We would be happy to see the dispute between Germany and Poland resolved peacefully through negotiations, but if there is an attempt to change the situation by force and threaten the independence of Poland, then a European conflict is inevitable, and our country will inevitably be drawn into the vortex." Chamberlain then discussed the issue of conscription, saying that the countries of continental Europe had overestimated the significance of Britain's move, "so that this strong aversion made our efforts to build a peaceful front suffer great difficulties. If war breaks out in Europe due to misunderstanding, it would be a terrible event. The Labour Party's opposition to conscription is unfortunate, but it does not represent the public opinion of the nation. In the future, if the international tension can be slightly eased, there will be great room for the development of our business prosperity, and all countries in the world will benefit from it. The power to rebuild confidence is not only in our hands, but as long as I live, I will continue to hope and do my best to rebuild confidence." Chamberlain continued, saying that he had had the opportunity to meet with former French President Blum on Wednesday, who claimed that, according to his personal observations and those of his socialist friends, there was only one real danger that could cause war in Europe, "that is, the impression that Britain and France have failed to cooperate sincerely and have failed to keep their promises. If this is indeed the case, then no fatal mistake could be greater."</p>
<h3>Australian Queen Ship Stopped Yesterday Due to Fog</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] A Reuters special correspondent stationed on the "Australian Queen" reported today that the ship encountered heavy fog today, which made it difficult to navigate and has been stopped for more than eleven hours. This afternoon, the Queen visited the shops on the ship and bought two wooden sailor dolls (children's toys) for the Princess. Later, she and the King took a walk on the deck. In the evening, the King and Queen hosted a banquet for Reuters correspondent Gordon Young and official photographer Horton. After the meal, they watched a movie screened on the ship.</p>
<h3>Important Speech by French Prime Minister: Maintaining Peace with Strength, Welcoming Soviet Participation in Cooperation, Increasing Unity Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] French Prime Minister Daladier delivered an important speech in the House of Representatives today, saying, "France has decided to do everything in its power to resist any attempt to weaken its spiritual resistance." He continued, saying that the unity between Britain and France is stronger and more trustworthy than ever before. This is the basic principle of French policy and cannot be weakened by any conspiracy or malicious propaganda. "We believe that the Soviet Union's participation in common mutual assistance is highly desirable. The Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935 is still valid, which shows that making the Soviet Union participate in cooperation equally and mutually is an integral part of our diplomatic thinking." Daladier continued, saying that even if the British, French, and Soviet governments have differences of opinion on the form of the agreement, they have agreed in principle at the beginning of the discussion, that is, to act jointly to ensure the supreme interests of peace. Daladier mentioned that France and Turkey are conducting negotiations to establish a guarantee agreement, the purpose of which is to ensure peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. Later, he discussed the issue of national defense, saying that the French government has no intention of reducing its military steps. If a large army is still mobilized outside the French border, then France will strengthen its military measures. In 1939 alone, France's national defense expenditure has reached 500 billion francs. "Some people believe that the unity of France cannot be underestimated and hope to control it with threats and promises of peace in order to destroy its morale. If they are truly willing to obtain a fair and honest peace, we should be prepared to make it a reality. If there is an attempt to strike a blow to peace, then we should also compete with it in military strength. If those who are making us exhausted between the choice of peace and war, the necessary time to determine the outcome is still in our hands! France can never be opposed by force or cunning!"</p>
<h3>Danzig Issue: Germany Does Not Want to Participate in Meetings to Discuss, Attacks Speeches of British and French Prime Ministers</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th] Political circles here do not attach importance to the speeches of Chamberlain and Daladier yesterday, and said that the declarations of the two are only to explain to the domestic public the reasons for the two countries to expand their armaments with huge sums of money. Chamberlain's statement on Britain's attitude towards the Danzig issue in his speech stated that Germany does not want to participate in any meetings to discuss the Danzig issue, because the free city is originally German territory, so the Danzig issue is not related to Poland's independence and sovereignty. Unless there is an attempt to call the crooked straight and the straight crooked. If Britain really wants to interfere in this issue, Germany believes that this step by the British government is not to maintain peace, nor is it to show Britain's neutrality. Political circles also criticized Daladier's speech, saying that this move is actually to explain to the public that the current increase in special taxes is for the purpose of expanding armaments, which is also the result of the serious situation. France's praise of peace does not have a deep impression here, because for 150 years, French political circles have had the desire to dominate Europe, and the so-called love of peace can no longer be expressed in the language of the 1789 revolution, because Napoleon was also a revolutionary soldier. From the perspective of France's colonial government, it is already known that the French have honey in their mouths and swords in their bellies.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th] All German newspapers are commenting on the international political situation reports of Chamberlain and Daladier last night, saying that the official statements of the two are only for domestic purposes, hoping to gain public sympathy, and constantly increasing huge sums of money to expand armaments for the purpose of encirclement policies. The newspapers also unanimously and fiercely criticized British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to mix the Danzig German issue with Polish sovereignty. The German newspaper said that these two matters are completely separate and cannot be related. The Nazi newspaper People's Observer expressed regret that Chamberlain said that all evils originated from Germany and Italy, and questioned whether Chamberlain knew that U.S. President Roosevelt believed that countries threatened by Germany had replied to Germany's questions. The newspaper also said that Germany's attitude towards the countries of Southeastern Europe is extremely peaceful, while Britain is the opposite. The newspaper finally questioned whether Britain believed that this was enough to help solve the Danzig issue. The German General Report said that so far no one has dared to say that Germany's proposal to solve the Danzig issue has harmed Poland's sovereignty. Poland's so-called zealous patriots have gained Britain's support, which has made the Danzig issue difficult to solve, and Chamberlain himself, in turn, believes that such steps are suitable.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Political figures here expressed doubts about Chamberlain's speech. They believe that although Britain has repeatedly expressed to Germany that there is no hostile attitude, the facts show the opposite, especially the statement that Britain has no intention of restricting Germany's expansion of business, which is even more contradictory. Regarding Britain's hope that Danzig will achieve peace as soon as possible, all parties believe that it is very laughable.</p>
<h3>French Reserve Officers Arrive to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 12th] French Defense Committee General Desveux led 100 French reserve officers to England today to visit Britain's armaments expansion projects and will stay for three days. It is heard that the general and his party will visit the Birmingham aircraft factory, review the army air force performance at Portsmouth, and inspect the Turkish fleet.</p>
<h3>Plymouth Resigns from British Foreign Secretary Post</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The official announcement stated that the Duke of Plymouth had resigned from the post of Foreign Secretary due to health reasons in order to recuperate. It seems that the vacant post will no longer be filled, because the British Foreign Office used to have two deputies to attend the Upper and Lower Houses separately, because the Foreign Secretary did not attend the Upper House meetings. Now that Foreign Secretary Halifax is a member of the Upper House and Butler attends the Lower House, there is no need to add another deputy.</p>
<h3>British Pavilion Opens at World Expo</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] The largest British pavilion in the World Expo here will open tomorrow for visitors. The opening ceremony will be presided over by British Overseas Minister Hudson, who will present a silver rose leaflet to the Mayor of New York. The treasures displayed in the pavilion include the British Magna Carta, which is carefully preserved. The British authorities specially made a sturdy box to hold it, which can avoid bullets, fire, and thieves cannot steal it. It is guarded day and night and has insurance of 100,000 pounds. The pavilion also has the genealogy of the first U.S. President Washington, indicating that Washington is a descendant of King John of England. In addition, there are replicas of British royal ornaments, and models and photos of British cities. There is also a band playing music in the British Pavilion.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Turkish Agreement: Chamberlain Announced Yesterday, France and Turkey are Also Conducting Negotiations, a Trilateral Agreement May Be Signed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Prime Minister Chamberlain announced that he will issue a report on Turkey before 4:00 today (British Summer Time).</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] A diplomatic correspondent for The Times wrote today that, barring unforeseen obstacles, the Anglo-Turkish agreement is expected to be announced in the House of Commons today. The scope and content of the agreement include the Mediterranean and the Balkans, which are related to Turkey's interests. The governments of Britain, France, and Turkey have completely agreed. The Pope is not expected to invite Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to convene a meeting to resolve the disputes between Germany, Poland, France, and Italy. He has apparently received guarantees from Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the negotiations between Britain and Turkey on the conclusion of an agreement have reached complete agreement on the main issues. France is also conducting negotiations to conclude an agreement of the same nature with Turkey. Therefore, Britain, France, and Turkey may sign a trilateral agreement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] Authorities claimed that the Franco-Turkish agreement has been agreed in principle by both sides. As for the form of the agreement, whether it is a trilateral agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, or separate agreements between Britain and Turkey and France and Turkey, the final decision can be made today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 11th] The Executive Council meeting of the League of Nations, originally scheduled to be held on May 15, has now been decided to be postponed for one week so that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin can attend and be able to consult with Halifax and Bonet.</p>
<h3>Polish Senate Authorizes President to Govern by Decree; US Considers Trade Agreement with Poland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 11th] The Polish Senate today passed a bill authorizing the President to govern the country by decree until the next regular session of Parliament. The bill also grants the President special powers in national defense and finance.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 12th] According to yesterday's Danzig Sentinel, two squadrons of Polish heavy artillery disembarked at the Grunia station, a Polish military port ten miles from Danzig, yesterday. The Polish side explained that this step was taken to maintain order in the area, as the situation remains unstable and people are constantly in fear.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The US State Department announced today that the United States and Poland are considering a trade agreement, and exploratory talks have already begun.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 12th] The "Asahi Shimbun" reports that Japan proposed mediation to Germany and Poland several days ago to ease tensions between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Franco-Spanish Relations Tighten; Spain Rumored to Join Axis; Göring Leaves Italy for Valencia</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] Franco-Spanish relations are strained again. Simultaneously, it is rumored that Germany and Spain have agreed to negotiate a commercial agreement, and Spain may join the Italo-German military alliance.

<h3>Belgian Baron and Priest Detained in Japan; Reportedly Related to 'Currency Issues'</h3>

Father Gorada was arrested on April 18th, and Baron de Pechamps was detained on the 20th. Pechamps was detained on April 20th upon his return to Yokohama from Shanghai.

<h3>Plane Crash Kills Soviet Female Pilot and Brigade Commander</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] The famous Soviet female pilot Osipenko and Brigade Commander Sirotin were killed in a plane crash today. Both were hailed as 'Heroes of the Soviet Union'.</p>
<h3>Soviet Izvestia Comments on European Situation</h3>
<p>[Moscow, 11th] "Hitler's abandonment of his agreements with Britain and Poland, coupled with the recent signing of the Italo-German military alliance, has changed the entire European situation. Therefore, mutual assistance pacts among peace-loving nations should be established swiftly." The above is the tone of today's editorial in the semi-official newspaper "Izvestia." The paper also stated, "Western European political leaders still want to deceive themselves, claiming that Germany's abandonment of its agreements with Britain and Poland and its military alliance with Italy has not changed the European situation. Such arguments are not only incorrect but outright lies, intended to deceive public opinion. In reality, it not only changes the outlook for Europe but also causes the worst changes in the already unstable situation. Since the Italo-German military alliance, it has been clear that they have united against Britain and France, and the proposals put forward by Britain and France cannot be considered reciprocal in nature. Due to its geographical location, if Poland and the Baltic states are invaded, the Soviet Union could face most of the war alone. The Soviet Union sincerely wishes to negotiate a mutual defense pact with the Western European powers. When Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, he mentioned seeking an alliance with the Soviet Union for cooperation. However, so-called cooperation implies reciprocity. Without a foundation of reciprocity, true cooperation is difficult to achieve."</p>
<h3>Chicago Fire; Grain Elevator Explosion; Many Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 11th] The grain elevator of the Robertson-Keedy Company here suddenly exploded and caught fire today. The force of the explosion shook an area of about one block, killing as many as ten people. Four employees of the elevator and one firefighter were crushed to death by collapsing walls. As many as seven firefighters were injured. The intensity of the fire has not been seen in years, and firefighters were unable to control it, causing it to burn for quite some time. It spread to two other grain elevators nearby. Many fire trucks slowly arrived, numbering over a hundred. As of the time of this report, the fire has been burning for three hours, and the fire is still not decreasing.</p>
<h3>Britain Loans 5 Million Pounds to Romania</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 12th] Yesterday, British Trade Minister Stanley announced in the House of Commons that the British commercial delegation led by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, which is holding Anglo-Romanian economic negotiations in Bucharest, has learned that Britain has agreed to loan 5 million pounds to Romania. This action is not unusual; this agreement was reached before the delegation arrived in Bucharest. The agreement was signed yesterday in Bucharest by the Romanian Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, British Minister, and Leith-Ross. The agreement also stated that this measure would increase trade between Britain and Romania, and Romania has the right to use the funds to purchase any goods and may use them to purchase armaments. According to the agreement, when the harvest is reaped, Britain must purchase 200,000 tons of wheat from Romania, paying at international market prices. However, the procurement and transportation will be managed by the British government. It is reported that the previously agreed Anglo-Romanian commercial agreement has been amended, but details were not released yesterday.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Today's Shanghai!</h3>
<p>Today's Shanghai, including the entire foreign concessions, has fallen under the military power of Japan!</p>
<p>Under the coercion and oppression of military force, the Shanghai Concession authorities have abandoned their "neutral" stance and taken actions to serve the Japanese side. They prohibit Chinese people from displaying the national flag; they suppress patriotic speech in Chinese newspapers; they even forbid the publication of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's pronouncements; they allow Japanese plainclothes agents to arrest Chinese people in the concessions at will; they declare a strict prohibition on people within the concessions from engaging in political activities; and they have ordered restrictions on speeches by Chinese people in the concessions. While we must shed tears of sympathy for the difficult situation of the Concession authorities, we cannot help but express regret and sorrow for their willingness to yield. Because with every concession to [the Japanese], everyone will worry about its own future!</p>
<p>The compatriots of all circles in Shanghai have been fighting bravely for more than a year amidst all the difficulties, dangers, humiliations, and terrors! Supporting the Central Government, supporting the Commander-in-Chief, supporting the protracted war of resistance, and supporting the united front, the compatriots of Shanghai have been the most enthusiastic and resolute. Responding to and implementing any military, political, or economic call from the government leaders, the compatriots of Shanghai have also been the most enthusiastic and resolute. Spiritual mobilization, the National Covenant oath, and opposing Wang Jingwei's "anti-communist peace" actions and pronouncements, the compatriots of Shanghai have been the most enthusiastic and resolute. Now the compatriots of Shanghai have entered an even more arduous and dangerous situation! How sympathetic and admirable is their struggle! Their situation should raise everyone's vigilance even more!</p>
<p>Our Central Government is very concerned about the current situation of the compatriots in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the British and French consuls, demanding freedom of speech and publication and freedom to display flags for compatriots in the concessions. This requires all sectors to unite and support in order to achieve it. Today's report from the Associated Press, Washington, 12th, states that Britain and the United States are prepared to cooperate against Japan regarding the Shanghai concession issue. Leaders from all walks of life and colleagues in the media should especially step forward and rally to be the backing for the government's protest, solicit and promote the opinion of friendly nations, and work together to advance the movement to restrain Japan and regain its true position. The beneficiaries will not only be the patriotic compatriots in Shanghai!</p>

<h3>Crushing Economic Aggression Conspiracy; Industrial Cooperation Actively Promoted; Hong Kong Promotion Society Holds First Talk Inviting Celebrities; Arousing Overseas Chinese Attention and Efforts to Help Enhance Anti-War Strength</h3>
<p>In order to develop wartime industries and exploit resources to enhance the strength of the war effort, the government established the China Industrial Cooperatives in Shanghai last August. Minister Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Finance presided over the effort, promoting the industrial nation-building movement. Thirty thousand work cooperatives were planned to be set up in various regions of the country to develop light industry to relieve war refugees. Overseas promotion societies were established to advance the society's work. Since its establishment, the work has achieved remarkable results. The Hong Kong China Industrial Cooperatives Promotion Society, to assist the development of the society's work and enhance the effectiveness of relief, convened its first symposium at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 4:30 pm, inviting Hong Kong's leading gentlemen and celebrities. Those present yesterday included Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling, Sir Shouson Chow (Chairman), Sir Robert Ho Tung, barrister Lo Man Kam, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Snow, Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Chow Shouson, Li Xingqu, Ho Gam Tong, Ye Lanquan, Zheng Shouren, Miss Pu Aide, Yan Chengkun, Rong Guanwen, Chow Xingchi, Tang Zhaojian, Liao Mengxing, Ye Guisong, Miss Shan Dexin, Miss Guo Fengxuan, Miss Liu Qingxuan, Dr. He Ailing, Mrs. Li Hanhun, Ho Minghua, Zheng Hongnian, Slaw, and many others. Gathering Hong Kong's leading gentlemen, celebrities, and industry giants in one hall, it was a grand occasion. Sir Shouson Chow stood up to give the opening remarks, followed by Miss Pu Qingde, Sir Robert Ho Tung, Snow, and others. Finally, Chairman Chow announced that Hong Kong women's organizations are scheduled to hold a dance dinner at the Hong Kong Hotel on the evening of the 26th of this month to raise funds for the Society. Mrs. Li Hanhun Wu Jufang stood up as the meeting was about to end, briefly stating that the organization of the Industrial Cooperatives is the only effective way to provide relief to refugees. However, there are many refugees in Guangdong and Hong Kong. It is hoped that the cooperative will implement the founding principles of the society and provide relief nearby to conform to the spirit of cooperation. Excerpts from the speeches are as follows:</p>
<p>Industrial Society's Purpose Summarized into Six Major Points</p>
<p>Chairman Chow Shouson said, in brief, that the China Industrial Cooperative General Society is located in Chongqing and is managed under the leadership of Minister Kong Xiangxi. In Hong Kong, there is the 'China Industrial Cooperative Association Hong Kong Promotion Society.' The work of this cooperative has a great relationship to the future of China's war of resistance. Because the Japanese occupy our coastal provinces, the industries of the provinces that have been devastated by them have reached more than 70 percent. They hope to reduce China's production capacity in order to achieve a quick war and a quick resolution plan. However, although our country is in a period of war resistance and has suffered all kinds of destruction by the Japanese, not only has the spirit of resistance not been affected in the slightest, but it has strengthened the determination to resist and the belief in a protracted war. At the same time, in order to enrich the strength of resistance, we are working harder to promote industry. This is why the cooperative society was established. The purpose and work of the society are divided into (1) collecting economic power and re-exhibiting industry, (2) enabling refugees in the occupied areas to have legitimate industries to support themselves, (3) rescuing industries in the coastal provinces so that their machinery can be transported to the interior to enrich the organization, (4) exploring local raw materials and discovering resources, (5) producing various items needed by the front, (6) enabling domestic goods to be promoted. The above is the purpose of founding the Industrial Cooperative Society. Since its establishment, it has been widely supported by Chinese and foreign people. Even in New York and London, there are sympathetic responses. How should our Hong Kong overseas Chinese rise up to help quickly? Now that we have the government as a backing, all Chinese people should act as the vanguard of the government.</p>
<p>Our Raw Materials are Endless, Depending on Human Development</p>
<p>Miss Pu Aide said, in brief, that the heroic resistance of China today, the spirit of the whole country, men and women, old and young, whether in the front or in the rear, all unanimously supporting the government, is a good omen for the birth of a new China. Although under the bombing of airplanes, the people in the war zones are living a life of displacement, leaving their homes and villages, their spirit of great fearlessness is still calm and intensifying the work of resistance, which is even more admirable. At the same time, participating in important production work is even more in line with the total mobilization that China is urgently promoting, which is the China Industrial Cooperative Society. China has now reached a period of great industrial development, and industrial cooperative societies for mining and smelting metals and manufacturing raw materials have been established, and are being intensified. In total, there are more than 50 kinds, and more than 500 have been established. Among them, the creation of machinery requires a larger amount of money, with each society needing more than 1,000 yuan. It will not be difficult to promote this throughout the country. China has endless raw materials to develop, deeply buried underground, so China's only major problem in resisting Japan is how to explore raw materials, cooperate with manpower, and unite to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>Solving Three Problems, Enhancing Anti-War Strength</p>
<p>Sir Robert Ho Tung said in his speech, in brief, that since the Sino-Japanese war, compatriots in China and abroad have had various organizations for saving the country and providing disaster relief. The one with the greatest and most lasting benefits for the future of the country is none other than the Industrial Cooperative Society. Although other organizations are important, they only belong to temporary measures, while the establishment of the Industrial Cooperative Society is a fundamental plan. National economy and people's livelihood are all based on this. Now China is in a period of resistance to the war, and all things are needed, and the import of foreign goods is experiencing various difficulties. In addition, the industries in Shanghai and other places have been destroyed by the war. Therefore, if China wants to compete in the world, it must focus on industry. From this point of view, the establishment of the China Industrial Cooperative Society is indeed the only important move. This industrial movement can solve China's three major problems: (1) using China's natural resources to enhance the strength of the war of resistance, (2) re-establishing China's industrial foundation to protect rights and interests, (3) providing technical training for tens of millions of displaced refugees to establish a foundation for their lives and enable the country to cultivate talents as the driving force for developing industry. The benefits gained from the above three matters are immeasurable. The purpose of the initiators is to plan to set up 30,000 cooperative societies in appropriate locations in the country. It is unfortunate that there is a shortage of skilled personnel and insufficient start-up capital, so they have not been able to achieve their goals. Although the central government has allocated 5 million yuan, called the loan fund, to help this endeavor, this fund is only used to lend to cooperative societies in various places and must be repaid at the specified time. In addition to capital, there are also recurring expenses and special expenses. This really relies on the assistance of Chinese and world people. Therefore, we have this meeting today to discuss solutions. This meeting is convened by the Hong Kong Industrial Cooperative Society Design Committee. Hong Kong is the center for promoting this plan. Branch processing groups have been set up in Shanghai, Xiaolulai, London, New York, Singapore, Saigon, Batavia, and other places. Their task is to handle fundraising matters, purchase application materials, transport donations, collect technical proposals, recruit professional talents, and publicize domestic and foreign obligations.</p>
<p>Many Foreigners Help, Compatriots Should Work Harder</p>
<p>The current chairman is represented by Miss Ai Ai De. Foreigners who support include Bishop He Minghua, the wife of Financial Secretary Jin Xiyi, the wife of Chief Medical Officer Situ Yongjue, and Mr. and Mrs. Jue. All the foreign friends have sacrificed a lot of energy and time to work for China. How should we Chinese people work even harder? There is no need to say more. Moreover, Hong Kong has a close relationship with China in terms of geography and commerce. China prospers, Hong Kong prospers, and China declines, Hong Kong declines. The prosperity and decline of each other are inseparable. I hope that our compatriots will work together with one heart and one mind to assist, contribute financially and in terms of effort. As for publicity obligations, we must rely on the efforts of colleagues in the press. I think the gentlemen of the press are extremely enthusiastic about patriotism and will be happy to help. I believe that if this initiative is successful, China will not only gain glorious peace, but China's resources can be developed, China's industry can be developed, the lives of the Chinese people can be self-sufficient, and the 60 million or more compatriots who are suffering can rely on industrial skills to support themselves, reduce the government's burden, and cultivate the country's vitality. This is in line with the Three People's Principles and is sufficient to uphold the legacy of President Sun. If this initiative cannot achieve its purpose, the items needed during the war of resistance will be even more lacking, and tens of millions of suffering compatriots will inevitably lose their support. In the future, China's financial resources will inevitably be absorbed by others. The consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, the success or failure of this industrial movement lies in the hands of the Chinese people. Where to go? My compatriots should know how to choose.</p>
<p>China's Human and Material Resources Have Not Been Slow to Mobilize</p>
<p>Finally, Snow said, in brief, that many people believe that China is late in issuing a mobilization order today, but in my opinion, I do not think so. Since the Japanese sent troops, they have shown signs of exhaustion, but China is not the same. After a long war of resistance, it is still very relaxed. This alone is enough to see one aspect. In addition, after China issued the mobilization order, there was a rapid progress. Who said that China's mobilization was late? From the perspective of the Chinese army, they are now mobilizing 10 million, and the people's self-awareness is even more remarkable. In terms of the economy, the establishment of this industrial society shows that China's strength in the war of resistance is increasing day by day. I think that the current problem of China's mobilization should be to prevent [the Japanese] from using the raw materials and manpower in the occupied areas. All Chinese people should assume the task of spiritually preventing [the Japanese]. At the same time, we should find ways to solve the livelihood problems of the people and refugees in various places. On the one hand, we can increase national defense production, and on the other hand, we can be self-sufficient. All of these are in line with the purpose and objectives of the Industrial Cooperative Society. Therefore, whether it is the people in the country or overseas Chinese, they should help each other to complete this mission in order to resist foreign aggression.</p>

<h3>Lung Disease Woman Jumps from Hospital Ward in Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and Commits Suicide; Deceased Yang Xia Entered the Hospital for Treatment for Only One Day; Suddenly Jumped from the Third Floor Yesterday Morning and Died on the Spot</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a case of a hospitalized woman jumping from the third floor of the Tung Wah Eastern Hospital in So Kon Po and committing suicide occurred. The deceased, named Yang [ ], 33 years old, was admitted to the "Qiao An" room on the third floor of the hospital at 6:00 AM on the 11th by her family due to lung disease. After the doctor on duty examined her, he told her to rest peacefully. At the time of admission, the deceased had no other diseases besides lung disease. Therefore, although the deceased was in the ward, she would often get up and move around in the room, or go to the balcony railing to look down. The nurses in the building did not stop her because her illness was lung disease, and movement did not affect her body. Later, the deceased muttered to herself, as if she was thinking nervously. The nurses in the building saw that the deceased's shape had changed suddenly, so they took strict precautions. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the deceased did not know why she was touched and took advantage of the nurse's unawareness to get up and walk to the balcony near the sky staircase, jumped down, fell to the ground, and her head burst, her limbs were broken, and her internal organs were severely injured. When she fell to the ground, the watchman downstairs heard the sound and went out to inspect the sky staircase, and was shocked to see her tragic situation. He immediately reported to the person in charge of the hospital. The doctor and nurses on duty in the hospital treated her, but soon, she died due to her serious injuries and ineffective rescue. The people in the hospital then called No. 1 Police Station to report the case and sent someone to notify the deceased's family. Soon, No. 2 Police Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to the hospital to investigate everything and take statements from the people in the department for record, in preparation for the future opening of the court by the magistrate. Then, the hearse took the deceased's body to the public morgue for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Bank Recruits Staff; Takes Thirty in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Since the Guangdong Provincial Bank moved its office to Shaoguan, its business has been thriving. In order to adapt to the war situation and improve efficiency, it plans to recruit 60 staff members, openly held in Shaoguan and Hong Kong, respectively, taking 30 in each place. All young people of Chinese nationality who are 20 to 35 years old, who are able to endure hardship and are honest and reliable, and who are not afraid of danger and are willing to serve in the mainland and nearby war zones, can go to 81 Ma Bao Tong, King's Road, Hong Kong, 3rd floor to register. The qualifications for the examination must meet one of the following three items: (A) Graduation from a university or college, (B) Graduation from high school and having served in a agency or department store for more than two years, (C) Having served in a government or commercial bank for more than three years. It is heard that the registration date is from May 15th to 18th, and the examination date is May 21st. The examination subjects are the Party's Principles, Chinese Language, Official Documents, Accounting, and General Economic Knowledge. After being admitted, they will be trained and tried for three months. During the training and trial period, a monthly living allowance of 30 yuan will be paid. Afterwards, the salary will be determined according to the performance, starting from 50 yuan per month, including food and lodging.</p>
<h3>Ho Tiechou Expands Yi Tong Education Institute; Will Perform Famous Drama to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>After Ho Tiehua held an exhibition of famous scenic spots in the occupied areas to raise funds for the military disaster relief society and the Women's Federation, he felt that rescuing out-of-school refugee children and cultivating new national forces was a top priority. He gathered comrades in the painting community and established a mass school. Because the place was small and could not accommodate refugee children, he expanded and established the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Yi Tong Free Education Institute" and called on the society. He then obtained the "Spring and Autumn Drama Troupe" led by Tang Huaiqiu and Zhang [ ], who were willing to perform the drama "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain" for free to help raise funds. The troupe automatically donated all the performance fees so that the funds raised could be used for the Yi Tong. It is heard that it is actively rehearsing and will be performed in the near future.</p>
<h3>Benefit Performance for Disaster Relief by Distinguished Women: The Exquisite "Dream of the Red Chamber"—Introduction to the Various Protagonists (1)</h3>
<p>Special Report</p>
<p>We have already provided a general introduction to the benefit performance for disaster relief hosted by the Chinese Women's War Disaster Relief Association. During the rehearsal period, the master of drama, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, came again last night to guide their performance skills, personally demonstrating those exquisite postures, and side-view, front-view, and looking-back movements, setting a good example for them.</p>
<p>Miss Guan Bixia starred in the scene of "Daiyu Burying Flowers." With her slender figure and wearing those gorgeous ancient costumes, she was naturally endowed with a delicate face that was prone to illness and sorrow. She swayed and moved slowly and carefully in her performance. Before burying the flowers, she sang a passage of the song of cherishing flowers, shifting from a very high pitch to a low one, and then rising again after being suppressed. Her manipulation was very smooth and lively, and she was able to portray Daiyu's personality. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian couldn't help but clap his hands and exclaim: "Bravo!" "Good!" "Not bad!"</p>
<p>Miss Guan Bixia as Daiyu in the play</p>
<p>In the scene of the Twelve Golden Hairpins of Yi Garden celebrating a birthday, the instructor pursued perfection, performing it repeatedly. Mr. Luo Tangsheng, as Baoyu, was an elegant and refined young gentleman, with unique skills in singing and acting. As the feast began, the Twelve Golden Hairpins sang the birthday banquet song in a rotating manner, with clear songs and beautiful dances, neat steps, and controlled movements, all regulated by the music.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Tangsheng as Baoyu in the play</p>
<p>In the scene of "Qingwen Tearing Fans," it is extremely difficult to find the right person. Fundamentally, one must possess the qualities of being—fiery,娇俏, and thoughtful—to take on the role. Miss Li Huilan took on the difficult task of playing this role. In the scene of serving Baoyu, she broke the fan. Coincidentally, Baoyu had a bit of resentment in his stomach that day, so he took the opportunity to vent it, scolding her a few times, which provoked her.</p>
<p>Miss Li Huilan as Qingwen in the play</p>
<p>But women shouldn't provoke her. Otherwise, she will cry sadly. Look, the more vigorously she cries, the more it stimulates Baoyu's love and affection. What is the result? He slowly stepped forward and gently apologized to her. She turned her tears into a smile. "Do you like the sound of tearing fans? What does spending a thousand gold pieces for a smile matter?" Baoyu said those words, and Qingwen laughed "喀嘻" as she tore each fan to pieces. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Our Army Achieves Victory in Zengcheng Area: Captures Fuhe and Presses Towards Zhucun, Enemy Troops Retreat from Longkou, Longxiang, and Liantang Area, We Are Actively Advancing, Striving to Annihilate All of Them</h3>
<p>[Express News from Wengyuan] On the northeast two lines, the enemy troops have recently been restless again, attempting to invade Boluo from the east and Conghua from the north. Therefore, the deployment has been frequent in recent days. Regarding the enemy situation on these two lines, according to military intelligence, it is described as follows:</p>
<p>Capturing Fuhe, the Enemy Retreats to Zhongxin According to the enemy in Zengcheng, they have been severely damaged by our attacking troops many times. In recent days, they have been arranging defensive works and are extremely busy. On the morning of the 9th, more than 500 artillerymen and more than ten field guns arrived from Guangzhou, reaching the area between Zhongxin Market and Fuhe Market on the Fuhe Highway. Also at noon today, more than 1,000 enemy infantrymen marched along the Guangzeng Highway to Changping Village, appearing to advance towards the Tan Zhengguo area. In order to crush the enemy's conspiracy to invade, our 12th Group Army's National Army Division headquarters launched an attack in the Erlong Liangtian area at noon that day, and also launched a surprise attack on Fuhe with surprise troops, immediately engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy. Our army temporarily gained many captives. At about 4:00 PM, our army rested briefly. At dusk, our army attacked the enemy in two routes, and another unit launched a slanting attack from near Liangshui, attacking the enemy's right wing. The enemy was extremely flustered and hastily fought back. Our army quickly established contact on all routes and continued to launch a fierce attack, finally occupying Fuhe Market. The remaining enemy troops fled in defeat to Zhongxin Market. Currently, our army is pursuing the enemy while also advancing towards Zhucun and Danqiu and other places.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Retreat from Longkou and Other Places As for the Huaxian area, the enemy troops have been lying dormant due to our suppression. Recently, because our army on the Yuehan Railway line has been advancing section by section to Jiangcun, the Huanghua Highway is already under serious threat, and it is feared that we will cut off their retreat. Yesterday, on the 9th, a part of the enemy troops in the Longkou, Longxiang, and Liantang areas were transferred back to Guangzhou. Currently, only a hundred or so enemy infantrymen remain in the area, and it seems that they are abandoning this line. Our armies of Peng and Li have actively advanced to annihilate the enemy, and they must completely resolve the enemy in these three places during the day.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan] On the morning of the 9th, more than 500 enemy artillerymen and more than ten cannons arrived in Zhongxin from Guangzhou. At noon, more than 1,000 enemy infantrymen arrived at Changping Village along the Guangzeng Road, with the appearance of continuing their advance.

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Zhang Agreed to Exempt Demolition of Blockhouses in Four Counties: Mr. Deng Longguang's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Express News from Zhaoqing) In the past, the blockhouses in the territory of the Siyi counties were ordered by Deng Longguang, the military commander of the Sixty-Fourth Army, to be demolished within the deadline to facilitate the war. At that time, the people of Siyi and overseas Chinese from Siyi raised objections. In addition to telegramming the army commander to request exemption from demolition, they also telegraphed the highest military authorities and Zhang Fakui, the acting commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone, to order the exemption from demolition. According to Deng's remarks, the demolition of blockhouses in Siyi was entirely from the orders of superiors, and our army was ordered to execute it. It was not intended to deliberately make things difficult for the local area. After receiving telegrams from the Hong Kong Siyi General Chamber of Commerce and Industry and overseas Siyi groups requesting exemption from demolition, our army immediately telegraphed Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang of the Fourth War Zone, stating everything. The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry once again telegraphed, applying to send strong men to guard the blockhouses to assist in the war, and it was also considered feasible. We directly submitted it, and recently we received a telegram from Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang, approving the exemption from demolition. I am also very happy and can comfort the people of Siyi and overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Department of Education Orders Various Counties and Cities to Continue to Accept War Zone Students and Faculty: Revises Registration Methods to Broaden Acceptance</h3>
<p>(Express News from Qujiang) Since the Department of Education moved to Qujiang, considering that students and faculty in the war zone in this province are inevitably being transferred to various places, if no measures are taken to accommodate them, it would be detrimental to cultivating the foundation of the country. Previously, orders were issued to various county governments and provincial schools outside the war zone to establish local registration and acceptance, so as to send them to their original schools and other schools separately to maintain their studies. Now, the registration methods have been revised again, and orders have been issued to various county and municipal governments to implement them conscientiously. The order stated, "The outline for the methods for accepting faculty and students withdrawing from the war zone in this province has been approved by the Provincial Government and implemented, and orders have been issued repeatedly to various county and municipal governments and provincial schools to conduct war zone faculty and student registration. However, due to the extraordinary times and traffic obstruction, few people know about it, so not many people have registered and signed up at the county schools. Now, in order to facilitate registration and broaden acceptance, in addition to establishing a registration office in Hong Kong, entrusted to the private Lingnan University, and establishing a registration office in Kowloon, entrusted to the private Guangzhou University, the registration methods have also been slightly revised. All counties and schools in the rear should immediately move to continue to hold them."</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Harass Zhongshan: Zhang Huichang Orders Strict Prevention of Traitors</h3>
<p>[Correspondence from Zhongshan] Enemy warships off the coast of Zhongshan have been watching Xiangzhou Qiren Rock on the 10th and 11th. On the morning of the 10th, they also shelled the area.

As of yesterday (12th), the enemy warships had sailed elsewhere, and the situation had eased. However, in the Tanzhou area of the Ninth District, many enemy warships are coming and going again, attempting to land again, entering Zhongshan, with ulterior motives, causing rumors to flourish in recent days, saying that the enemy is surrounding Zhongshan's coast and watching for landings, or that the situation is tense and preparing to evacuate the population. A false alarm occurred in Wan Chai the other day. In this regard, it is urgent to strictly guard against traitors, prevent problems before they arise, and prevent micro-invasions. A special order is issued to all districts, townships, and police stations to pay attention to arresting them.</p>

<h3>Seventh District Commissioner Zhang Yan Promotes Education in Southern Guangdong: Maoming Concentrates Students for Military Training, and Holds Teacher Seminars</h3>
<p>(Correspondence from Maoming) Maoming originally had more than five provincial and county-run secondary schools, with thousands of students. After the fall of the provincial capital, many students who escaped here to study became more lively. However, the schools lacked contact with each other, which has had an impact on the progress of wartime cultural work. Since the arrival of Zhang Yan, the Commissioner of the Seventh District, he has given many instructions on improving local education, concentrating the city's middle and high school students for military training, with more than 800 male and female students participating, which is an unprecedented event in the southern route.

<h3>"Four Hundred Million Compatriots" Premieres in America</h3>
<p>The premiere of the film "Four Hundred Million Compatriots" at a famous theater in New York recently caused a sensation throughout New York City. It was almost sold out every showing for two weeks.</p>
<p>This film records all the circumstances of China's War of Resistance. The lives on the front line and the dynamics of the rear are all vividly captured on camera. The filmmaker is the very experienced Joris Ivens. Three years ago, he gained fame for filming the news feature "The Spanish Earth" and is one of America's most famous news photographers.</p>
<p>The making of this film was extremely difficult. In China, Joris found that the materials he needed were scattered in various places. He had to travel at least eighty miles a day. In Spain, he only had to hear the sound of artillery fire at the hotel in Madrid and set off. He could be on the front line within fifteen minutes and start filming. But in China, the battlefield was so vast that it often took a week to find a good piece of material. He also spent a lot of effort and took great risks to obtain the footage of the great battle of "Overcoming Taierzhuang".</p>
<p>When the film was released in New York in March of this year, he was invited by journalists to present his working situation and thoughts. Below is a section of his report:</p>
<p>"... Regarding China, many Americans only know that it is a vast and rootless land and countless people who have suffered hardship. Therefore, the first purpose of my making this film was to go deep into the Chinese interior and bring back some real things, so that the audience can see the true face of China, their leaders and people, and their heroic posture in this War of Resistance, and sweep away the general superficial view of China. I can believe that I have not failed in making this film. The audience will definitely feel amazed and excited after seeing the heroic battle of the Chinese people in this film and overturn the old prejudices... Everything in this film is without embellishment. I recorded the truth..."</p>
<p>By the way, the narration of this film is provided by the famous star Little March.</p>
<h3>Isolated Island Silver News</h3>
<p>Recently, in Shanghai, many film practitioners have leaped to become new directors. For example, Xinhua has Wang Yin and Chen Jiqing, Guohua has Zheng Xiaoqiu and Gong Jianong, etc. Li Ying of Yihua also recently presented the script of "The Flower Girl" to the authorities, intending to give it a try.</p>
<p>The purely classical beauty Zhang Cuihong will make a comeback, starring in Wu Cun's "Wang Baochuan."</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to the Dumi Theater on Avenue Joffre and Route Doumer, which will soon appear in Shanghai, some people are also planning to rent the entire second and third floors of the Paramount Hotel to open a theater. Negotiations have taken place, but it is feared that it will not be realized.</p>
<p>Liu Qun and Yin Xiucen recently led the un-disbanded trainees of the Xinhua singing and dancing troupe to visit Yihua. At that time, Fang Peilin's "Three Transformations of the Girl" was being filmed, and they were warmly received by Han Lagen and Yuan Meiyun.</p>
<p>Wu Cun's new work "Spring of the Isolated Island" has been renamed "Spring Rhapsody," starring Zhou Xuan.</p>
<p>Many drama and film personnel have gone to the mainland and Hong Kong, resulting in a lack of technical and specialized talents in the Shanghai film industry. In order to remedy this panic, various companies have promoted former assistant staff, especially in the areas of photography and lighting.</p>
<p>The comedian Liu Chunshan has also recently engaged in film production. His script has already been completed and is tentatively titled "No Way Out." He is currently in negotiations with a company to produce it. If negotiations are successful, Liu will direct and act in it himself.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin has been rushing to produce "Three Transformations of the Girl" for days, and he looks exhausted. At the same time, Yuan Meiyun, "the girl," also shows similar symptoms. However, Guan Hongda, despite his hard work, has actually gained weight. Some people say it's "one got fat, a pair got thin."</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's "Gold and Silver World" has been produced and filmed. His next new work is "Life and Death Hate," written by Sun Jingsuo, which is a love drama.</p>
<p>After Wang Yuanlong finishes filming "The Swallow Thief" at Yihua, he will go to Hong Kong, supposedly to film "The Beauty Trap." Wang Yuanlong previously starred in the silent film "The Beauty Trap" at the Da Zhonghua Shuanghe Company, in which Wang played Zhao Zilong. This time, he will likely play the same role again.</p>
<p>Wen Yimin's "Mysterious Lady" follows "Mulan Joins the Army" in being shown at the New Guang Theater. This film is a moral drama, and the performance is very tragic.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua, starring in "As It Is," is scheduled to begin filming on the 15th. Diao has been getting fatter recently and is in good spirits, so she often appears on Connaught Road.</p>

<p>(9)</p>
<p>"Get out!" Toris said, sitting on the bed and crying angrily. Leo then walked towards the dressing room. Toris threw a telephone directory at Leo. When he turned his head, she had already hidden under the covers. His pace slowed as he walked into the dressing room.</p>
<p>Leo traveled outside for four days, to a small hotel. He discovered that Toris was no longer at home, and even his friend Meek didn't know where she had gone. When he returned to the office, the secretary worriedly collected a small sum to pay for his hotel rent. He learned that the concert manager Rossi was looking for him.</p>
<p>Rossi was able to give him a five-week contract for five hundred dollars a week to sing at the Scala Opera House in America. At that time, Caifa would also be the lead role. The first opera, "The Wanderer," was about to be staged immediately. Leo and his company were bankrupt. Although he was unwilling, he had to sign the contract.</p>
<p>"This is a matter of bread," he murmured.</p>
<p>On the first night of the performance, the audience in the theater was packed. Leo panicked for the first time on stage. He saw his own makeup in the mirror and was startled.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he sighed softly.</p>
<p>"My love, you look so good," said Caifa, who looked very beautiful in the costume of the heroine of the play.</p>
<p>"I look as ugly as the madman Rasputin," said Leo.</p>

<h3>The Finale of the Six Major Football Championships. Who Will Win the Xuhe Cup? If South China Wins, They Will Complete the Creation of Our Hua Team Sweeping the Championships. The Navy Has Abundant Talent, and Fierce Competition is Expected.</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special) The Xuhe Cup football final will be held at 4:30 this afternoon at Jia Shan.</p>
<p>South China has already won two championships in the five championships organized by the General Association—the Group A League and the Special Silver Medal. The remaining three championships have also fallen into the hands of our Hua team. If they defeat the Navy today, they will complete the glorious creation of sweeping the six major championships.</p>
<p>It is recalled that in the league final, South China once defeated the Navy to win the championship. The Navy at that time may not have been much different from today's. South China has selected elite players from both teams to participate in this time. It is reasonable to say that South China will not fail this time.</p>
<p>However, many of South China's players are suffering from foot injuries and are unable to play. Therefore, the lineup is not very complete, so whether they can win is quite doubtful.</p>
<p>Sweeping the championships is a major event. It is hoped that all the generals of South China will work together and not let their efforts be in vain.</p>
<p>Judging from South China's strength, although several elite players are absent, they are still very strong. They are very confident in Tengli, and their power will not be disappointing. However, the Navy now has abundant talent and has concentrated its efforts to form an army, which is not easy to deal with. Don't underestimate them.</p>
<p>As for their battle formation, it is not yet known how strong it is, so it is difficult to predict. South China has selected the following generals:</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Xie Jinhong, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Yang Shuiyi, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, Deng Guangsen, Tan Zhenhui</p>
<p>(Reserves) Luo Douwen, Lin De, Yang Genbao</p>
<h3>The Tennis World Appeals for Refugees. A Charity Match Will Be Held Today at the Hong Kong Cricket Club Ground.</h3>
<p>(Fundraising) An unprecedented tennis</p>
<p>(Vibration) charity match will be held this afternoon</p>
<p>(Disaster) at 4:00 p.m. at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. Tickets are priced at $1.50 and $1.00, and all proceeds will be donated to the British Relief Association to help our country's disaster victims. All the matches are doubles matches.</p>
<p>(Veteran) The first match is between De</p>
<p>(Encounter) Fu and Gao Luwen and</p>
<p>(New Aristocrat) Li Rurong and He Jialiu. Many people know the skills of He and Li, but the partnership of De and Gao is also something the audience is eager to see. "Mr. Cane" De Fu is a former Shanghai singles champion. He participated in the Hong Kong Open Doubles this year, but was eliminated halfway due to an incompatible partner. Today, he and Gao Luwen will play together, and it is believed that there will be a wonderful performance. Gao is not only a tennis master, but also represented Hong Kong in the inter-port football team, holding an important position in the midfield. He is strong. A few years ago, he partnered with Fen Zha in doubles and competed fiercely with the then-popular Lin Zhen brothers. His tennis skills can be seen from this.</p>
<p>(Fateful) The second match is between Lin Zhen</p>
<p>(Again) brothers and the Xu brothers.</p>
<p>(Reunion) In this year's Open, the Lin Zhen brothers made a cold performance due to strategic errors. Mok and the Xu brothers competed for the championship, but they were depressed and unable to stretch themselves. Today, they have the opportunity to meet again and will put on a great show.</p>
<p>The third match is between De Fu and Gao Luwen and the Xu brothers, which is also worth watching. The two Xus are energetic, and De Fu is experienced. There will be good shots.</p>
<p>(Enemies) The fourth match is between Li Rurong</p>
<p>(Again) and He Jialiu and Lin</p>
<p>(Gather) Zhen brothers. It is expected that this match will be the most exciting scene in all the matches. Because the Lin Zhen brothers have revenge in mind, they will definitely go all out. At the same time, the audience can also test whether the tenacious tactics of the Li and He pair are still effective.</p>
<p>Each match has various styles, so don't let it go lightly. I urge tennis fans not to be stingy with their wallets, spend money to enjoy themselves, and do good deeds. It is really a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>A Fire Broke Out at the South China Stadium. A Small Part of the Stands Was Burned.</h3>
<p>At 5:40 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the South China Athletic Association Stadium on Caroline Hill. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished quickly, preventing a disaster.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:40 p.m., several members were practicing baseball in the field, and the staff in the field were having dinner in the clubhouse. At that time, the members practicing baseball suddenly saw thick smoke rising from the stands near So Kon Po. They knew it was a fire and immediately notified the clubhouse staff to turn on the water pipes to extinguish the fire. On the one hand, they notified the Central Fire Station by telephone. After receiving the report, the station immediately dispatched a fire engine. At the same time, the No. 2 Police Station also dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene after hearing the news. However, when they arrived, the fire had already been extinguished by the people in the field. However, it still burned 300 feet long and 10 feet wide, with a loss of about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is suspected to be arson, otherwise it would not have started from the top of the stands. The police are currently investigating the matter.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Basketball Match. A Great Battle of Heroes and Heroines. It's a Charity Event...Don't Be Stingy</h3>
<p>The Guangdong-Hong Kong Qinian Association's military service group is organizing a men's and women's basketball charity match to raise funds. It will be held at 7:00 p.m. tonight at the YMCA basketball hall on Bridges Street. The men's YMCA team will play against the Star team, and the women's Meifang team will play against the China team. Heroes and heroines will gather together at one time, and there will be extremely exciting performances to satisfy the fans. Tickets are priced at $5, $3, $1, and $0.50. Yesterday, they were distributed for sale separately. People from all walks of life consider these two matches to be a rare opportunity, and because it is a charity event, they are happy to buy tickets. It is believed that the fundraising results will be good.</p>
<h3>Today's Baseball Game. China Meets a Strong Enemy. Let's See Who is Stronger, Hong Kong Club or China?</h3>
<p>...[Our Newspaper Special] Baseball is the most brain-intensive sport. The changes are magical and different at every moment. If you understand the rules of the game, you must admit that it is more mysterious and spectacular than any other ball sport.</p>
<p>...This year's Open Baseball Tournament has already opened last week. Two good shows have been staged successively, giving the audience a good new impression.</p>
<p>...Today, another big battle is coming. It is China against Hong Kong Club. The match will be held at the Caroline Hill Navy Field at 2:30 p.m. I heard that Hong Kong Club has recruited many new players this year, and their strength is quite strong. Unlike last year, when they were mediocre and incompetent, they have a new lineup this year.</p>
<p>...Although Hong Kong Club is playing for the first time today, it is difficult to estimate their strength. We will have to see it clearly after the war breaks out. However, according to news from related parties, there are indeed several good players from the Golden State who have joined the team, so they have suddenly developed a strong ambition to compete for the future championship.</p>
<p>...Coincidentally, the team's first match is against China, the defending champion. If the team is really strong, then this battle is equivalent to a touchstone. If they have the possibility of defeating China in the next match, it is no wonder that they are ambitious.</p>
<p>...China suffered a setback in its first match last week and was defeated by the Myanmar slaves in a situation where it should not have been defeated. However, this was an accident, and its championship prestige has not been damaged as a result. If the members work harder on cooperation, they will not be afraid of any strong enemies.</p>
<p>...If Hong Kong Club is not extremely strong, it will not be easy to defeat China. In short, this battle is worth watching. (Tai Sui)</p>

<p>May 4th, 4 to 1</p>
<p>The drums of the crowd urged frequently, and the three-month period was over. Looking around, I felt a chill. After several discussions, a surprise army stood out. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Liang Rongzhao, Shi Han, Fei Shu Xie Da, Hou Chengtang, Bi Ludo, Da Gao, Nu, Feng Jingxiang, Yan Ba Chen</p>
<p>Looking closely at the bizarre lineup, the weaver had long been worried about it. However, the talent is exhausted today, and although it is desired to adjust and strengthen it, it is impossible. Bi Ludo's transfer to the front line is really a creation. Shi Han's appointment as the central army is also a forced attempt. Moreover, the YCO, with its tired division, is facing the champion's high intentions. It is no different from hitting a stone with an egg. Who knows that there are things in the world that cannot be expected by people? In the past two battles, they had the heart to win but could not win. Tonight, they thought they would lose, but they could not lose. "Living after being placed in a dead place," "When two armies meet, the sadder one wins," the art of war has already said it. Our people broke the cauldron and sank the boat and tried their best to fight to the death. We have a considerable understanding of the weather and lighting, and the competition is more regular than before, with no faults. Although Bi Ludo has no achievements, Shi Han has just started his career and his performance is excellent. He is the most outstanding member of the whole game, making people applaud and praise. Finally, with a score of four to one, they played the triumphant song for the first time. The two inside forwards each made one goal, and Da Gao bravely pulled out two cities. It is enough to be comforted by this small victory. The strange soldiers and different achievements are especially pleasantly surprised. After the game, the Philippine side believed that our team's measures were gradually improving and firmly invited us to the fourth game. Our side politely declined due to the fatigue of the soldiers. The result of the ball battle is magical and unpredictable. Tonight's battle is another solid proof.</p>
<p>Baguio Baquio rings the bells, and at this time, the affluent people of the Philippines gather together. Our people, with the good intentions of the host, also drove to Baguio early this morning. The car traveled for nearly five hours before arriving. Along the way, the trees were sparse and the mountain roads were winding and tortuous. Looking down, it was like walking a long snake. The sky here is always spring, and the mountain scenery is especially pleasing to the eye. When entering the country, there is a wooden sign with the words "Baguio warmly welcomes you" written on it. Behind it is "Thank you for your kindness, turn back as soon as possible." In the middle of the road, at dangerous corners, there are often warnings, such as "If you want Baguio to be quiet, unless you use the car brakes more and the horn less," which is quite similar to the road police signs in a certain city in the Americas, "Driving slowly allows you to see the city, driving fast only allows you to see the prison." When we arrived, we had a quick look and it was almost dusk. We took off our clothes and took a bath and felt quite shivering. In the evening, the clear wind and bright moon stirred up the thoughts of the guests. In the distance, we faintly heard the sound of flutes in the village. Turning our thoughts to the mountains and rivers of our homeland, we increased our sorrow. We embraced the quilt and lay down, and the single felt still felt cold. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Lessons Learned from Going to the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong football team suffered two defeats and one victory in this expedition to the Philippines. The record was extremely poor, which was not expected by the team itself. The news came, and it made the hearts of the Hong Kong people cold and greatly disappointed. The main reason for this is that the team suffered successive injuries and illnesses. The luck was bad, and the heat and lights of the Philippines caused it. I dare not not do my best, and it is difficult to live in peace.</p>
<p>In the three-game review, those who were able to maintain the level of performance in Hong Kong with good performances were only Jun'gan and Rongsheng. Those who were passable were Da Gao, Shi Han, and Chengtang. Old players such as Jingxiang and Tiansheng also had measures that were not as good as when they were in Hong Kong due to changes in the environment. Rongzhao and Guangrong had not recovered from their foot injuries, and their true talents were not seen. The rest were mediocre and unremarkable. Strictly speaking, they were not enough to help. I myself did not take warning and injured my leg on the stage. I was deeply sorry for the heavy trust. Fortunately, all the friends were full of energy, the group was harmonious, the trip was harmonious, and they felt at home. And the lessons learned from this trip have their own special value, which can be used as a reference for any team that goes to the Philippines in the future.</p>
<p>I think that if you want to send a football team to the Philippines, you must pay attention to the following points: (1) There must be a month of preparation and strict training to make the players full of strength. The level of football skills in Hong Kong is still difficult for the Philippines to compare with. If the strength is not lacking, it should be able to cope with it easily. The Hong Kong team was selected too early this time, which made the players who performed well recently fail to be selected. Moreover, there has not been a proper test match after the selection, and there is no certainty of cooperation. The training of English and Portuguese members is insufficient, and the Chinese members have too many football affairs. Both excess and insufficiency are not suitable. This is the mistake in the preparation aspect. (2) The Philippine weather is hot all year round, especially in May and June, which is the most unbearable. Insufficient sleep and food, and a sluggish spirit, how can you fight for a long time? February is relatively cool, and it is suitable to go south at this time. (3) In the war in the Philippines, the opponent's actions are uncultured, and the audience (referring to Filipinos) are even more barbaric, helping the evildoers and giving people a bad impression. Moreover, it is easier to get injured in evening games. The visiting team should have a full reserve of six or seven people to prepare for emergencies. If the Hong Kong team is short of generals this time, it has been unable to cope with it. How can an incomplete army win? (4) In the evening battle, low lights are easier to control, but high balls are often difficult for beginners. This is a vision problem. Without a considerable amount of time to understand, it is the biggest loss for the visiting team. The Hong Kong team's ability to cope with ease in the third game was nothing but a habit. I think it is best for the visiting team to have three or four days of practice under the lights before the game, so the blind bumps and leaks, and the pre-judgment errors, can be reduced.</p>
<p>In addition, it is advisable to use low balls frequently during the game to facilitate vision, and to use long passes to break the enemy's usual "man-to-man" defense. The food and accommodation of the players should be properly adjusted. It is inevitable to drink in hot weather, but ice water hurts the stomach, and drinking too much is useless. All these kinds of things are what the team leaders should know in the future, so that everything is prepared and adapts to the environment, and they will not repeat the Hong Kong team's mistakes this time. As the Bible says, "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell," so the sacrifice of the pioneer of the inter-port team this time can indirectly benefit those who follow, so what harm is there?

<h3>Basketball Association Incident. South China's Appeal is Upheld. The League's Decision to Re-schedule the Final</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 8th of this month, after Xingdao defeated South China 31-29 in the Open Men's Group A Basketball Tournament, South China stated that during a request by Xingdao to replace a player, South China learned from the recorder's whistle to suspend the game. However, Xingdao took the opportunity to shoot the ball in, and therefore lost to Xingdao by two points. Therefore, it filed seven complaints with the Basketball Association. At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the League convened an emergency committee meeting at the Shengsi Hotel to discuss and resolve this matter. Those who attended the meeting were Yan Dianlian (Xingdao), Liu Xiwent (Zhong Sheng), Xie Feilie (Zhong Nan), Zhao Kuiz (Li Xing), Ma Zhaohua (Hua Xiong), Cai Guoping (Dong Fang), Li Zhiming (Reporter), Yang Juhua (Hong Kong University), Dian Huiming (Meifang), Xu Heng, Hu Zhengqu, Lin Zhong, and others. Lian Dianlian presided over the meeting, and Xie Feilie recorded the minutes. The press reporter read South China's appeal. Then the referee of the game, Han Lie, and the linesman Liu Deyu reported on the circumstances of the execution of their duties at that time, and the members expressed their opinions on the incident. Later, South China coach Hu Zhiqu expressed his opinion, saying that the sound of the whistle used by the recorder at that time was no different from that used by the referee, so the South China players stopped moving according to the sound of the whistle. If the players did not stop and continued the game, they would be against the referee and would be in violation of the rules. The players focused their attention on the ball during the game and only listened to the sound of the whistle to determine whether to advance or retreat. At this point, reporters and people from both sides were asked to leave, and the committees discussed the matter. Since Yan Dianlian represented Xingdao, he recused himself, and Zhao Kuiz chaired the meeting instead. As a result, it was decided that the South China team did not recognize the two points that the Xingdao team had won. It sent a letter of ten complaints to the committee. According to the letter, an emergency meeting was convened in accordance with the procedures, and the referee, record officer, and timekeeper of the game were invited to attend. According to the referee's report, when the recorder blew the whistle, the ball was in progress. However, the record officer said that when the whistle was blown, the ball was out of bounds. In the midst of the confusion of the audience, it was difficult to observe the situation at that time. The committee could not find conclusive evidence from this report, so it was decided that the two points won by Xingdao would be cancelled, and the scores of both sides were equal. The two teams should re-schedule a game.</p>

<h3>Stock Market Prices Higher This Week; Trading Volume Still Low.</h3>
<p>The local stock market this week has improved due to the easing European situation. The stock prices of companies such as Hong Kong Hotel, Whampoa Dock, Hongkong Land, Telephone Company, Dairy Farm, Kowloon Wharf, and Hong Kong Electric have all increased. However, sellers are reluctant to part with their stocks at higher prices, resulting in low trading volume. It is generally expected that the prices of various stocks will continue to rise.

<h3>Saluting Thirteen Fighters</h3>
<p>— Latte</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of our national culture and a gathering place for cultural fighters. The vigorous cultural endeavors and revolutionary struggles of the past years can prove this. This cultural stronghold, even though it is now being trampled by the bloody feet of Japanese fascists, still has the excellent tradition of struggle deeply buried in the hearts of countless young fighters, stirring up a burning tide of resistance. No matter how bad the environment created by the Japanese warlords and their running dogs, or how foul the poisonous flames they spew, they cannot extinguish the strong will of the young fighters. This is precisely why the "isolated island" is not lonely; its surroundings are buried with huge sparks, and its shores can be swept by waves of anger at any time. The reality of the struggle never deceives. Precisely because of this, those people are very jealous of the struggle of these patriotic men and women, and they do not hesitate to use all kinds of means to persecute them.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student Wartime Work Team, which ignited the fiery flame of the patriotic movement and stirred up the anti-Japanese and anti-traitorous tide on the "isolated island," was naturally regarded by the authorities as a "monster". They negotiated with the concession authorities and demanded that their activities be stopped. These young fighters were surrounded by this bad atmosphere and were subjected to various threats of surveillance, arrest, and warning by the concession authorities. Now, thirteen of them (four women) have been forced by the final warning of the Central Police Station to leave their homes, the smoky and miasmic Shanghai, and embark on their journey elsewhere.</p>
<p>From the suffering and hardships experienced by these thirteen fighters, we have fully confirmed that they have written a page of heroic combat life for the sake of the nation, forgetting themselves. It is also fully confirmed that they are indeed a vital force of the new force of the Chinese nation, and it is even more fully proved that they and the invaders and traitors are in an extremely opposed and irreconcilable position.</p>
<p>They are now forced to arrive in Hong Kong and plan to transfer to the Guilin battlefield to serve. However, even before they have started their long journey, they have already suffered a serious blow. However, I know that they do not feel pain. They still issue strong calls and strong accusations of justice from this inevitable phenomenon in the course of struggle. This makes us even more admired.</p>
<p>But in order to ensure that our warm salute does not become a formal, empty gesture, we need to reach out our ardent hands and use the material resources we can donate to complete the journey of these thirteen fighters back to the battlefield. These thirteen fighters are about to leave, but this is not an escape or refuge. Instead, they are forced to change to another combat environment and sow their anti-Japanese sparks again. Friends! Understand them correctly and help them!</p>
<h3>Soviet Female Aviator (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Paulina・Osipenko, translated from Moscow News</p>
<p>Osipenko is the most famous female aviator in the Soviet Union. She was originally a poor peasant girl. Here is her self-report of her struggle history. –Translator</p>
<p>When I was young, I never dreamed that I would become an aviator. My childhood was spent in the Ukrainian countryside, in Novospasovka, in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. My father was worried about our bread, and our thoughts were suppressed by heavy farm tools.</p>
<p>When I reached school age, I stopped reading after a short time to help the family by working as an infant. My school years passed by hastily.</p>
<p>I graduated from the second grade, and after only learning to read and write, I worked on the farm.</p>
<p>In 1924, when I was seventeen, I joined the Young Communist League.</p>
<p>In 1927, my family joined the collective farm, and I was also shaken into society.</p>
<p>Although I was very young, I could tell the difference between the collective farm and my father, a poor farmer... I thought, if I read more books, I would definitely understand more.</p>
<p>Soon after, our collective farm received many admission certificates from agricultural schools, and I also requested to study. I was sent to Kiev to study a six-month poultry farming course.</p>
<p>But after attending the first lesson, I immediately realized that my level was far behind other students. They all had seven years of education, while I only had two years of education.</p>
<p>Should I go back to the collective farm? No, I will never. Even if I work day and night, I will stay here. I studied desperately, and my mind was filled with "effort", but I succeeded. Six months later, I graduated with other students.</p>
<p>So I contributed my opinion to the collective farm and organized a poultry and livestock farm in the Petrensk District, which determined my destiny.</p>
<p>One summer, two planes came, and the rumbling sound covered all the sounds on the farm. I stood at the door, watching, afraid to breathe.</p>
<p>The plane landed, and there was a great commotion in the village. Everyone, with gray beards and swaying, ran to the field to see this strange thing. Of course, I was in the middle of this group of people.</p>
<p>The strangeness made me stunned. I didn't know if what I saw was a plane or a person. I didn't believe my eyes. Outside the fuselage, together with the mechanic, there was a woman walking with a leather helmet-shaped thing on her head.</p>
<p>"Oh! Can women fly too?" I asked her, my curiosity overcoming my shyness.</p>
<p>"Of course, they will," she laughed (I later learned that she was not an aviator, but a caregiver).</p>
<p>'Are you frightened?'</p>
<p>'Not at all.'</p>
<p>'I know a female aviator in Kakovfo,' a pilot said.</p>
<p>I turned around and heard that a woman can also become an aviator, or maybe I can succeed. Why not? I want to go, I want to go, I firmly decided that I will be an aviator.</p>
<p>One of them, I knew, was studying at the Aviation School in Sebastopol. Without hesitation, I wrote him a letter. I told him about the plane that stopped in our village, the woman in the plane, and the female aviator in Kakovfo. I also wrote that I wanted to be an aviator. I am twenty-three years old this year, in good health, and a member of the Young Communist League. Could he help me learn to fly?</p>
<p>His reply came to Sebastopol, we can confirm.</p>
<p>I went there.</p>
<h3>Night Watch</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>——Fragments of a strong man's life</p>
<p>The dark night sky stretches broadly before people's eyes. The vast and silent suburbs are eerily quiet. One cannot see the fields and villages, nor hear the voices of people and the barking of dogs. Looking up into the distance, there is only a black void. The trench that stretches along the railway also merges with the ground.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, the strong men guarding the night are advancing to the trench. Although the path needs to be groped in the darkness, there are no difficulties.</p>
<p>Groping along the railway, arriving in the trench, crawling forward, in a moment, one passes through the entire trench and reaches the end. Then, one takes up a post and stands guard.</p>
<p>In the trench, one imagines an unceasing invasion, treating the mountains in front, the thatched huts, and the trees as Japanese planes coming for a night attack. We do not neglect defense because we are in the rear; nor do we relax our vigilance because we are in the dark night. Only by strengthening exploration and steadfastly guarding, the drifting clouds in the sky, the sparse trees, and the flickering points of light, the subtle sounds of the wind blowing across the grassland are all imprinted clearly on our minds. The courage and determination of a group of people, the police, fully demonstrate a full combat power.</p>
<p>Everyone pricks up their ears, listening to the night sounds flowing out of the silence, listening to the rise and fall of the natural music in the high sky. In this cold and desolate suburb, although there is no crackling of flames, when we imagine the battle scenes on the front line, our hearts will jump.</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly a faint sound comes from the mountain valley. We shine a flashlight, and three blurry figures are immediately reflected in our eyes. Urgently, raising our voices, we loudly ask for the password. They ignore us. We continue to ask for the password again. When we answer the first part of the password, they cannot answer the second part. And they remain silent.</p>
<p>"No password?" The group of people becomes nervous from doubt. With a shrug, they jump out of the trench and run to surround them. Many beams of flashlight light are focused on the three people, and they immediately stop moving and ask for the password:</p>
<p>"Final" - "Victory"</p>
<p>The password is shouted. Approaching for a closer look, it turns out that the training officer and a resourceful chief of staff have come to observe and test our defensive spirit. Another person is a conscript. After paying respects, the training officer asks us with a smile: "If you are really on the front line guarding the night and encounter someone without a password, what would you do?"</p>
<p>"Surround them, search them, disarm them, and escort them to——."</p>
<p>The training officer nods. Continuing to smile, he says: "The most important thing is: alertness and communication; vision and hearing must control all directions. One should only run when one should advance quickly; even if separated from command, one must be able to act alone."</p>
<p>Returning to the trench, standing at the post, we eagerly review the expectations in our hearts again: perhaps our strength will achieve something in a certain position and fill us with the joy of victory?</p>
<p>The night becomes deeper and also darker, the wind also becomes stronger. Looking up at the high sky, due to the gradual and sharp decline in natural pitch, we realize that the first half of the night has passed. When the second shift of strong men guarding the night gropes to take over the shift, although we embark on the return journey, we still feel attached to the trench.</p>
<h3>Two Eras</h3>
<p>— Jiong Chang</p>
<p>In the handwriting, I seem to see a patch of blurred bloodstains. In my memory, it is a long-sealed past event. I am overwhelmed. A vague phantasm emerges in my mind.</p>
<p>One year, two years, three years... pass by uneventfully. Two different faces in the dark shadows of the high walls also gradually disappear. However, I think it is worthy of pride.</p>
<p>In the west of the city, beside that, under the trees, in that vast open space, the sound of shouting slogans, the enthusiastic speeches, the startling gunshots, the men and women who fell in a pool of blood under the trees, disarray, fleeing, fear, terror, anger... Everything intertwines into a memory of comfort. After all, in an unfortunate arrangement, the prison cell, without freedom and without the breath of new, became their residence.</p>
<p>The second year was on a cloudy afternoon. After much hardship, I saw them in that cramped, dark little room. We painfully spoke some irrelevant words, because many "protectors" (?) were standing at the door. I quietly signaled the good news I brought, and they both only smiled bitterly slightly. That impression was so deep. I gave them a touching smile. A ray of light flashed across those two thin and haggard faces, that heavy shackle.</p>
<p>Another year passed. Those who made inevitable sacrifices in the era of transit still remained in that peaceful and eternal realm. The storms outside could not blow in at all. Separated by a high wall, they were unaware that the dark era had passed.</p>
<p>Today, the last day of Youth Movement Week, the commemoration in this island under a foreign flag makes me recall my friends who were imprisoned for liberation. However, the times are different! Everything is changing.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"No, I still have work to do."</p>
<p>"Look, your injury is too severe."</p>
<p>"Yes, I was in pain all night."</p>
<p>"How did it get so bad?"</p>
<p>"I think it was from that night." He said unintentionally, "This is a memento."</p>
<p>"Forgive me! Or, you just stab me once."</p>
<p>She threw herself into his arms and cried. This cry stunned him; he didn't know how to arrange himself in this moment. Fortunately, she roused herself and moved her head from his chest, forcing herself to change his bandages. She kept saying:</p>
<p>"I hope to see your injury heal soon!"</p>
<p>However, one of his comrades came and told him with a smile:</p>
<p>"The money has been received in full." Then he turned to her and said, "Miss Zhu, please go home, thank you!"</p>
<p>After hearing this, she seemed a little dazed; she continued to put new bandages around his neck, all the while tearing up.</p>
<p>"What did that person say? ... What go home? ..." Then she immediately asked:</p>
<p>"Are you telling me to go home?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you should go home!"</p>
<p>As a result, her tears, which had just stopped, continued to flow. Her gradually calming mood was disturbed again. Since yesterday, she had been conquered by their lives, devoted to them, hoping they would give her shelter. She was already disgusted with her own family, especially her father. She had hoped to turn from darkness to light. But now, her once beautiful dream will be shattered again—leaving them whom she is reluctant to part with, walking back to her silent and evil family alone; so she cried, and shouted:</p>
<p>"I can't go home! ... I can't go home!"</p>
<p>"No, you should go home! Let me tell you the reason—"</p>
<p>"I won't listen, you are a liar!!! A liar!!!"</p>
<p>She stared at him and cursed fiercely. But she was still bandaging him, and she was being more careful, not letting a thin gap be left between the bandages, or a loose thread.</p>
<p>Other comrades, seeing this scene, also felt helpless and shook their heads. At the same time, they were waiting for this work to end quickly, their address needed to be moved immediately. (64)</p>
