<h3 id="c1">美國積極加入民主陣線的重大意義 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近年來世界侵略者的狂暴行動，已逼使其他愛好和平的國家，不期然而然地結成一個抵禦侵略的民主陣線，其主要的構成份子就是英美法蘇。英法蘇三國因爲歐洲互相關聯的關係及國際聯盟會員國的聯繫而支持民主陣綫及彼此合作的態度早卽顯明：美國則因地理及非聯盟會員國的關係，對於民主陣線的支持，態度向來較爲消極。但是國際情勢急速發展的結果，侵略國家更加圖謀密切的團結以便狼狽爲奸，愛好和平的民主國家自然也愈加感受瘋狂侵略者威脅，自然也就感覺到孤立及分裂之非計，已經結合的國家更加嚴密合作，未切實參加的國家也勇敢地積極地加入，並發揮更大的力量。這是國際情勢發展的必然趨勢，同時也就是美國不得不積極支持民主陣綫的根據。</p>
<p>美國的外交政策在最近數月來，已漸表露其應該前進的方向，但尙未見其具體化，積極化。卽如羅斯福總統屢次對世界侵略者的抨擊，也還未出消極的範圍。其最積極的表示應推美國國會開會以來羅總統屢次的言論及政策上，特別是昨日在參議院軍事委員會會議席上的秘密表示。據各方所洩露的消息，羅總統將要採新的外交政策，可以歸納爲下列各點：（一）確定對歐洲的方針，倘若歐洲有事，美國必願盡力支撐民主陣線，以抗獨裁者；（二）要求參議院軍委會指定法國爲美國的最前線，以應付將來民主國與獨裁國間的戰爭；（三）美國决定販賣飛機等軍火給法國乃至其他民主國家。這些消息發表後，已經引起世界各國不同的反響，其影響所將使國際政治起一個劃時代的變化，其意義之重大是可無庸贅言的。</p>
<p>對於羅總統這一劃時代的外交政策，我們應該認識的第一點，是它的確實性。每一個國家或政策之出現，不是一個政黨或一個個人的主觀表現而是當時那個國家及國際情勢客觀事實的反映：而每一種政策之能够實施，更需要這個客觀情勢的支持。羅總統新外交政策的確實性卽在於此。時代已把美國推出「孤立」的圈外，美國必須參加時時刻刻受到威脅的國際集團，因爲美國自己也因爲這種國際的威脅而受到莫大的壓迫和未來的禍患。德意日不但壓迫中國及英法蘇等國，並且直接間接損害美國權益，更要積極進攻美國。上引這些民主國家多受一分的壓迫也卽美國增加一分的危險。所以美國積極參加民主陣綫也卽保衞本國的權益。畢特門主張：「如不給予民主國家以自禦的機會，何異援助侵略國家」，紐約世界電聞報更謂：「……售英法以一機，其效用實十倍於六月以後增加美國空軍同量之數，吾人須知美國之安全，不在大西洋而在英法也」，確是一針見血的言論。其次，販賣軍火給民主國家，不但是帮助本陣線內的與國，並且是增加軍火商人的鉅大利益，其必得到本國政府後臺老板的支持，是無庸言的，因此，「紐約世界電聞報」率先著論，謂：「此事不啻英法除爲吾國國防站最前綫外，更惠我以黃金，吾人作此買賣實屬不勝幸運」，可見美國輿論支持羅總統外交政策之積極。這種政策一方面有世界情勢客觀的要求，另方面又有美國人民主觀的支持，其前途之遠太光明是可拭目以待的，孤立派的非難必終歸於悽敗。</p>
<p>羅總統新外交政策的第二點意義，是它行將發生的巨大效用。此點可以從兩方面來分析。其一在歐洲方面所發生的效用，不但是增强了英法的力量，並且是增强了美國本身的力量。羅總統說過：「美國的前綫在法國，有如英國的前綫在萊茵」，其關係之密切，可以想見。美國此舉不但可以保衞英法等國，並且可以保衞美國自己。因爲蓄意擾亂歐洲的德意，不但壓迫着英法蘇等國，並且準備着進攻美洲，東方侵略者的日本，以其侵佔中國的領土與權益，破壞太平洋的均勢，欲再進而威脅美洲，也莫不是德意兩個帮兇積極支持的結果。在遠東方面，能如另一消息所報吿：「美國參謀部正與加拿大起草一太平洋沿岸聯防計劃」，則美國在太平洋上的國防力量將大爲增加。羅總統已經準備在太平洋上增設海軍根據地。其决定太平洋爭覇的力量及制止日本侵略者猖獗的效用，已於日前着論剖述過，美國能再與加拿大切實合作，則不但因美加之聯防而得在太平洋上取得軍事的支配地位，並且可以增加英美兩國更進一步的合作。在遠東方面可能發生的效用，還有一個更重要之點，就是促進美蘇的切實合作，並促進蘇聯軍事行動的積極化。蘇聯還未能積極發動軍事行動，約有兩種原因。卽民主陣線尙未完全形成及德意在歐洲的牽制。現在美國支持英法的軍事，則等於積極參加民主陣線，同時也卽制止德意的狂妄而減少蘇聯所受的牽制，倘若國聯能因美國之支持英法而斷然實施盟約第十六條的規定，則蘇聯之軍事行動，不但可以師出有名，且可以無後顧之憂，一鼓而擊破侵略者的陣容。這就是柏林各報重視羅總統的政策，甚至如柏林晚報所强調：「……華盛頓已成爲反獨裁國家運動的中心」，柏林地方報謂「華盛頓與莫斯科乃同繫於一綫上」的原因所在。</p>
<p>最後，吾人還欲加一言者，卽世界政治的發展，是越來越促民主陣綫與侵略陣綫的界限明朗化，使每一國家對於敵友的取捨，知所適從。希望我們指導抗戰或參加鬥爭的人士，對於羅總統的新外交政策，多加考慮及反省！</p>
<h3 id="c2">博羅災情 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 柔芝</p>
<p>【報特訊】博羅縣城被日×盤據了兩個月，全縣被蹂躪的鄕村不知其數，至今第四區接近石龍的一角仍被佔據。記者未來博羅時，巳聽說博羅災情在東江各縣中算最嚴重。現在記者到了博羅，見到了數不淸的比在香港新界所見更慘苦的難民，觸目皆是的斷壁頹垣，巳知博羅災情嚴重之一斑，孰知調查結果，更屬驚人！茲分述于下：</p>
<p>博羅全縣分四區。先說縣城吧，被炸被燒片瓦不存的店舖房屋至少有幾百家，其餘半　半留的更不知多少，完整的幾乎沒有；被槍殺被燒死的有一千五六百，在避　期間意外病死的也有一百以上。此外，第一區有橫田排　，被燒房屋數十間，被殺十餘人；江東鄉，被燒房屋五六十間：水西鄕，也被燒去房屋數十間。第二區——泰尾鄉，全墟店舖一百六七十間，畫被燒毀，被殺幾人：七女湘鄕，墟內廿幾間店舖被燒，村落屋舍二百幾間被燒，被殺二人：中路鄕被燒房屋三十幾間，被殺十餘人；聯安鄕被燒房屋三百多間，被殺二十餘人；　圖鄕被燒房屋三十餘間，公莊一帶，被殺四五人。第三區——嚮水市，全墟一百二三十間店只殘存一間，被殺三四人；柏塘市，炸毀店舖三十多間，死廿二人；連安鄕，新作塘和顧岡燒去房屋最多，有一千五百間左右。第四區——田鄕，全墟九十餘間店燒盡，被殺的有一百二十餘人；長寧　，全墟五十多間店燒盡，郭石鄉，全墟八十多間店也燒盡—讀者們，你覺得這些數目字令你頭痛嗎？讓你想像這些數目字的眞實內容，你能够止於頭痛嗎</p>
<p>死者巳矣—生者如何呢？那麼多的店舖房屋被炸被燒了。將有多少人無家可歸呢？眞是不堪設想—那些房屋沒有被毀的人，在他們　難的時候，米糧家畜被×兵吃了。器具用品被土匪搶了，就是還有家，回去也不知怎樣才能活下去，所以，博羅全縣，受災極重，亟須救濟的難民，至少有五萬人以上——勉强可以自己想辦法生活的還不算在內，據縣政府派去調查的人報吿：附城鄕全鄕。只得　家人還可勉强過活，其他一槪都急持救濟；還有許多鄉，都差不多是這樣，說出來幾乎不能令人相信，但你若親自去看一過，不由你不信的！</p>
<p>他們逃難時候的情形，你們也想知道一點嗎？讓我重述幾個難婦的話吧（她們的話閘成一片，巳分不出哪幾句是誰說的了）——</p>
<p>「未天光，五更天，早早起身，趕快煮飯食了，」施男帶女，還要挑東西，拚命跑到山坑邊，整日不敢煮飯，恐怕火烟被×機看見，肚子餓得很，小孩子更忍耐不住，大哭起來要飯吃，但是×機時　飛在頭上，恐怕被×人聽見，就禁止小孩子哭呌，不許出聲，旁人恐怕連累到她，更嚴厲干涉，做父母的沒有法子，只得掩住小孩子的嘴巴，有的用力太猛，弄到小孩子不能呼吸，一下子就斷了氣—太過幼小的孩子，掩住嘴沒有效力，還是要哭，有的父母發惱了，用力揸他的頸，這樣撞死的也不少，××放火燒山，火頭迫近身邊了，大家搶着逃命，那時人踏人，不知踏死多少老人細仔—有些孩子較多的人，因爲要走得快才能逃命，帶不得那麼多小孩子，就　　丟了幾個，沒有人理他們，不餓死也凍死了—日裏飢，夜間寒，蚊虫又多，不死也得生病—平常時以爲渴是小事，到那時才知道，渴和餓一樣緊要，一樣難受。有些地方，一滴水也找不到，大家都渴得要命。有一個八九歲的女孩，要求飲水極迫切，其母用手把她壓低伏在自己膝上，嚇她說×人飛機來了，不提防用力太大，又壓得太久，等到將手放鬆時，女兒巳絕氣了！好在沒有落雨，如果有大雨。衣服弄濕了，地下睡不得，病死的人一定會更多。逃難幾天之後，許多男人不知到那裏去了，他們常常丟下老婆子女到別處去想辦法。因爲沒有男人保護，土匪更容易下手，一個婦人僅有的七手錢也被搜刮去，還戴耳環的當然保不住了，甚至爛　胎土匪都要—有些婦女面衫褲比較新凈一點，也被迫脫下，只　了內衣褲！有母子三人，餓得太難受了，爲母的不忍見孩子餓死，把小的一个賣了，　　三斗米！』報吿這件事的老婦人，設到這裏，滴下幾點老淚。接着又說：『還有更慘的，換得的三斗米，第二天早晨又被土匪搶光了！』</p>
<p>現在講到近來賑濟博羅難民的狀况：</p>
<p>×兵退出博羅以後，離民逐漸囘了老家，這時最迫切最嚴重的問題，就是食的問題，有很多難民，家裏不剩一粒米了，僑港惠陽商會救濟難民委員會，深知博羅災情之嚴重，很快就到博羅城來設立施賑站，派曾天錫為施騙處主任，一同辦事的男女共有四五人，他們辦事頗為認眞，起見是施飯，後來為煮飯太麻煩，人數太多，費時太久，遠路來的難民等得太難捱，　因此改為派米，每人約六兩，憂劵領取，他們施賑已有個多月了，來領米的難民最多時有四五千人。離城太遠的人受　不到，因此他們打算下星期推賑到鄉村去，這誠然是必要的。比外縣政府撥出省政府發下來的救濟公欵一部分，每天上午施粥一次，到來食粥的比較領米的少，以過最少也有二百人，多時則有五百人。這樣的施　還不　普遍，而原有賑欵又將用醫，希望海外華僑多多募捐錢米源源接濟！</p>
<p>其次是衣的問題。難民中多數很少衣服穿，小孩子也是一樣，天氣轉寒的時候，常見他們曲戰腳震，非常可憐。聽說香港僑胞團體已捐了幾千件棉衣和小，孩衞生衣等，不久可到。但是難民有幾萬，這幾千件還不濟什麼事，希望各界僑胞繼續募捐！</p>
<p>省政府發下來救濟公欵了一部分施粥。一部分以工代賑，大部分是將現錢派給難民，先調查登記，然後派券，叫他們憑劵領欵。因爲欵少人多，每人所得極有限，附城鄉每口人只得小洋四毫四分，有些人等了一天兩天，才領到這一點點的錢。我十分　他們難過，遭刧後的傳羅，要在縣屬籌錢來救濟難民，當然難於登天，因此也就只有向外處不曾遭刧的同胞呼籲！</p>
<p>還有一個極大的危機，就是難民病的問題。在　難期中，他們吃不飽，睡不足，起居無定時，水質又不良，蚊子又猖藪二病的人十分多，老弱婦孺更甚。紹旬　僑救護隊，惠僑救鄕會的東江救護隊，　來過縣城診治。救護，贈藥，停留幾天去，鄕下、他們走了後，又沒有讓，醫好的人是很少的，遭次記者來時，本和博羅難民救濟會一位同志偕行，帶有三箱藥品，但不幸被沙魚涌海關扣留住了，不知誤了多少人命，我們覺得？分悲痛，在這里，在目前，沒有比藥品更重要的東西了，就算那三箱運到也還是不够的！</p>
<p>在此次賑濟工作進程中，上述的僑港惠陽商會，緬甸華僑救護隊，惠僑救鄕會東江救護隊，以及本縣的賑濟委員，難民救濟會等，都盡了很大力量，表現了相當的成績，那是値得稱許的。</p>
<p>尤其値得稱許的是：廣東靑年抗×先鋒隊和博羅戰時工作團的同志們。博羅戰時工作團的同志，一部分到鄕村去，一部分留在城內，每天施粥派米，以及這兩天派錢的時候，他們都參加工作，不辭勞苦。</p>
<p>「抗先」的同志是最近由惠陽來博羅的，工作不過幾天，但處處表現他的優秀與積極。以前施飯派米的時候，秩序不大好，他們到了之後，分頭指導難民坐定一個位置，米到了之後再引導他們魚貫去領米，然後有秩序的退出，以前派米的地方很汚穢，他們到去之後把各個房子掃除凈乾，擺好凳子，（該處係第一小學，故有許多學生凳。）使難民在那里　頓時不會難堪。同時他們又對難民宣傳，態度極好，使難民極願　他們接近，樂意接受他們的意見，他們打算過兩天也到鄕下去服務，記者將和他們同行，或者有新的見聞，那時再報吿吧。　（完）</p>

<p>— 本報記者筆記</p>
<p>——前天在本港女靑年會——</p>
<p>政治方面在第二期抗戰當中亦是充分表現着進步的現象。政治重於軍事亦是衡山會議新决定的一個國策。政治的改良實在是比軍事的改良來得更加重要。</p>
<p>現在，把政治現勢分爲四點來談：</p>
<p>第一，精神力量方面</p>
<p>接受血一般的教訓，我們政治上的精神動員是更加强化起來，務使前方士兵與後方民衆都受到充分的精神訓練。因此，最近政府將訓練五萬靑年幹部以便分派到各內地從事宣傳民衆，訓練民衆，組織民衆的工作。來配合新現勢的發展，在目前，不僅是同仇敵愾的情緒有增無減，而那些懷疑抗戰的份子不是堅决起來，就是歸於淘汰了。至於×人的精神力量，可就差得很多了。日本軍閥屢次宣稱最短期間就可以結束戰爭，打敗中國。可是一而再，再而三，還是不得兌現，徒使日人從失望中發生厭戰的淸緒，而不斷發生反戰的運動。這是的的確確的事實，日本侵華軍人的精神，是遠不如前了。</p>
<p>以俘虜來說吧！抗戰初期，我們是很難捉到俘虜的，到了萬不得已的時候，×兵是寧可自殺，而不輕於投降。可是，最近捉到的俘虜可就多了。據來自華北者的報吿：×軍中常常有整隊向我投降，向我繳械的事態發生。與我們的越打越强，不知要差得多遠！</p>
<p>我們的英勇將士時常奉到撤退的命令而抗命再奔到前綫浴血犧牲。這種精神眞是太使人感動！蔣委員長在衡山會議中亦再三可囑勇取是應該的；但是，應骸勇敢服從整個神聖的任務。應進就進，應退就退，不可感情作用，作不必要的犧牲。從此，可知道我們的精神力量，是勝于×人，我們有着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>第二，物質力量方面</p>
<p>物質方面，亦是我國天天在增加，而×人天天在削减。我們的國幣和金融是很穩定的，可是×人的現金已經淸光了。證券的價格亦在狂跌中。×人的總動員法原是要集中全國的人力物力用來侵略中國，可是，這只是軍閥的企圖，面却遭受到人民的反對。從×人對于物質的節約，亦可知其恐慌之深度，我們雖然沿海喪失了很多地方，可是，我們的資本與工業，是在向西南西北發展中。政府亦訂定有西南西北的經濟建設計劃在積極推行。如西康之設省，公路，鐵路，都在積極建設中，要不是因爲抗戰，我們不知何時始注意到偏僻區域的建設呢！所以，從物質力量看來，我們亦是有着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>第三，內部團結方面</p>
<p>當年初開除汪精衞黨藉的時候，×人乘機宣傳我們內部分裂，事實上，因爲淘汰落伍的汪派，我們內部的團結益加鞏固。×人不是富傳什麼國民政府將赤化，便是宣傳國共將分裂。其實，共產黨早已誠心誠意地表示擁護三民主義，擁護最高領袖，擁護國民政府。任×人怎樣挑撥離間，亦是徒見其心勞日拙而已，我們眞的是越打越團結，而×人呢，却相反地越來越矛盾、越來越分雕。如近衛內閣之倒台，就是一個明顯的例子，所以，內部的團結亦是我國勝于×人，我們有着勝利的把握。</p>
<p>第四，國際規勢方面</p>
<p>抗戰軍與，民主家開始就同情我們。但是，空口的同情，我們認爲還是不够，因此，我們熱切地希望民主家國能够再進一步地同情我們，援助我們。其實，只要我們自己能够站穩着脚，一定是可能得到友邦的精神上與物質上的帮助的。照常情而論：一個人當有權有勢的時候，是最容易博得人家的逢迎勾搭；要是當他處境窮困的時候，人家可就報以白眼，理都不理他了。英美借欵適在廣州武漢失陷之後，因此，很多人認爲這是意料之外。其實。這是必然的，我們有抗戰到底的决心與能力，一定會使友邦的帮助益趨於積極。</p>
<p>這是無可諱言的事實：當法西斯侵略者的要求超過民主國家所能忍受之程度時，民主國家就一定會聯合起來，積極起來。</p>
<p>世界大戰在目前不是一二三年後的問題，而是一二三個月就會降臨亦說不定。我們並非幸災樂禍希望世界大戰爆發，而是說，我們應該把握着時機站穩着自己的地位，遵奉總理的遺教與抗戰建國網領所昭示者，明朗我們的外交路綫，粉碎德意路線的逐夢，而參加英美法蘇之和平陣線。予侵略者以打擊。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c22">日本眾院豫算會　質問戰白熱化　辯論焦點集中對華問題　軍閥內閣成為眾矢之的 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>【中央社重慶二日電】東京訊、一日×衆議院豫算總會質問戰、又進入短兵相接狀態、其辯論要點、集中於（一）內閣增加政黨出身閣員、（二）前任外相廣田、陸相杉山、與現任外相有田、陸相板垣之政策、是否有不同之點、（三）對華應否索取「賠欵」、（四）第三國在華利益、是否應予以尊重、</p>
<p>政黨閣員僅有兩人</p>
<p>首由政友會議員瀨戶質　稱、沼日前演說、曾謂尊重政黨地位、惟現閣中政黨閣員僅兩人、不足以表示現閣尊重政黨之意、應從速增加、庶能收舉國一致之實效、平沼僅答稱、渠組閣係取人才主義、不問其爲政黨員與否、但對政黨地位、必充分尊重、觀此問答可知近來政黨氣焰、較前略高、而軍閥官僚合作之政治、顯已引起其民衆之不滿、故政黨乘機提出要求、甚可注目、</p>
<p>裝腔作勢虛聲恫嚇</p>
<p>瀨戶又問　傳前任外陸兩相、與現任外陸兩相之政策、頗　出入、是否如是、平沼僅從側面答稱、世界無一定不變之政策、弦外之音、不言而喻、次某議員質問，第三國因日本在華軍事行動所受損害、每否將予賠償、有田答稱、日本或將自動予以救卹、但無意賠償、有出至此、强其聲調曰、最近內閣某部、主張採取更積極態度、宣布戰爭狀態業巳存在、　在軍事行動之下、三國在華利益、無須顧慮、此顯係對第三國一種恫嚇、聞者付之一笑、</p>
<p>欺人自欺索取賠欵</p>
<p>政女會議員江藤質問、謂對華何不索取「賠欵」、有田答覆、仍是欺人自欺語、又向　出所提　解决戰事四原則、是否仍未變更、有田答稱、日對華根本政策、固定不變、近衛十二月廿二日聲明、與以前聲明、雖有不同、但此乃環境變　結果、但近衛聲明至今尙未改變、此段答復、涵蓄頗多、民政黨議員渡邊質問稱、華北治安如何、板垣答稱、最近已將兵力集中于（佔領區域）內、極力維持該區域治安、其顧此失彼之窘態，可以想見、</p>
<p>板垣洩出對蘇野心</p>
<p>【中央社重慶二日電】東京外訊、陸相板垣今在國會預算委員會報吿稱、自張鼓峯事件以來、聯卽加緊在遠東作軍事準備、幷在邊界積極增防、雖時有越界之事，但此僅能認爲偶然發生之事幷無國際性質、目前尙無新事件發生、但日方巳有適當之準備、以便隨時應付事變云、</p>
<p>侵華戰事無法停止</p>
<p>【中央社重慶二日電】東京外訊、日陸相板垣在國會稱、日本並無以軍事以外之方法解決中國事件之意、日軍在華之行動、仍持繼續不懈、彼承認日佔領區內之秩序、尙未恢復云、</p>
<p>【美聯社東京二日電】日外相在下院辯謂預算會中、答覆關於英國代表將訪日之詞問謂、該項報告、渠並不知情、然「與世界要人交換意見、固屬可能而平常耳」、陸相板垣否認所傳日方將採用武力以外之方法、以解決中口爭端之謠謂如蔣介石政府不放棄反日親共之政策、日方軍事行動、將永不停止、民政黨議員多因問及近衛聲明收穫何在、有田答謂、無論中外人士，凡稍具眼光者、却當洞知中國之抗日、實爲至愚之事、近衞聲明收獲一部業巳表現、餘者不久亦可見及云云、</p>
<p>米內自誇稱霸東亞</p>

<p>這幾天報紙上一速刊布幾篇爲全世界注目的文章，就是德國元首希特勒英國首相張伯倫的演說和美總統羅斯福的談話。希特勒演詞之瘋狂嚇詐，張伯倫演詞之空言掩飾戰禍，本報前昨兩天小評，曾經明白措出。現在羅斯福的談的又已引起巨大的反嚮卽英法兩國人民的歡呼和希特勒御用報紙的怒　。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統卅一日與參院軍委會談話，曾稱「歐洲如發生任何衝突時，除戰爭以外，將不惜採取任何步驟，以爲民主國家之後盾，而對抗獨裁國」。這篇談話至少有以下三點値得注意：（一）更明顯的表示『和平不可分割」，美國若要維護民主與和平，則必須制裁國際上殺害民主與和乎的法西斯侵略者；（二）教訓及壯大英法兩國，積極起來，聯合蘇聯及美國，反抗法西斯侵略者：（三）對遠東法西斯侵略者，亦是一個有力的警吿，使他們在西侵南犯之時，不得不顧及他背後的打擊。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以說羅斯福的聲音，是保衞人類自由和世界和平的福音，這種福音之引起英法及全世界正義和平人士的歡呼擁護，和侵略者德意日本的反感怒　，原　意料中事。</p>
<p>尤可注意者，羅斯福總統不僅發表了談話就算，他還正在竭力爲廢止「中立法」，爲增强太平大西兩洋抗戰力量及爲聯合蘇聯援助英法而奮鬥，法國的『航空特派團」也正在大受美國的歡迎。這種政策在英法兩國妥協外交的領導者雖會感到不快，但英法兩國廣大的正義的人民，大衆終會打破這種不快的吧？</p>

<p>— Forelgn　Affair</p>
<p>保仁譯自一月份紐約</p>
<p>要是把東歐地圖翻閱一看，我們就可知道在德國與蘇聯之間，夾着愛斯通尼亞、拉特維亞、立陶宛、，波蘭，捷克，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫及許多其他較小國家，這些小國東連黑海，北接波羅的海，形成了一個「小國地帶」由於這些地方有着廣大的蘊藏及豐富的農產，因此就引起法西侵略者的垂涎，目前因爲張伯倫　拉第的妥協政策，一意對侵略者讓步的結果，使希特勒得到鼓勵，毫無顧忌地放胆侵略，界併奧國後，接着就是分割捷克，但希特勒的侵略野心，方與未艾，捷克的犧牲决不能塡塞他的侵略慾壑。他下一次的侵略目標，還是以準備進攻蘇聯的姿勢，循着「東侵」的路綫去收囘美末爾，歸還德國，拉攏匈牙利及成立所購「烏克蘭獨立國」。</p>
<p>烏克蘭是蘇聯西部的一個省份，有着人口三千五百萬人，此外聚居於波蘭南部的烏克蘭人有五百萬人，捷克東端的盧森尼亞自治區，也完全是烏克蘭人聚居的地方，在這三個烏克蘭人聚居的區域內，有富庶的煤，鐵，油礦和豐陝的麥田，在十八世紀末葉就有一百多萬的日爾曼人，移居在俄屬烏克蘭省的草原上，故德國野心家對烏克蘭的親覦，巳有很畏久的歷史，在一九二八年，歐戰卽將終了的時候，德國曾强迫俄國訂立利托夫斯基條約，規定俄國承認烏克蘭獨立，同時並派德軍四十萬駐守該地。後來因爲德國戰敗，這個迷夢，始成曇影，無形消滅，直到希特勒上台，竊取政權後，在一九三七國社黨全國大會中，也坦白地重伸德國對烏克蘭的野心。因爲烏克蘭地大物博，其土地面積比德國本身還大得多，要是希特勒能攫取這塊肥肉，則德國國內的失業問題，就可以全部解决，一切失業工人及無田耕種的貧農子弟，都可往那邊輸送，同時烏克蘭又是希特勒陰謀進攻蘇聯過程中，志在必得的東西、我們只需細細注意新近國社黨領袖們的言行，便會知道這種估計的正確。</p>
<p>東歐民族，素來很是複雜，而各民族的居在地和國家疆界，又有許多綜錯的地方，所以「民族自決」的口號，常被侵略者用爲改變國界的藉中，希特勒之鯨吞奧國，肢解捷克。就是用「民族自决」的口號來作侵略的飾辭，今烏克蘭人旣然分居在蘇聯，波蘭及捷克三國，則希特勒又可利用這個藉口，去煽動烏克蘭獨立，新近，柏林的國社黨部，已有烏克蘭局的設立，德國處蹄下的捷克境內，巳成立烏克蘭民埃自治會，幷在該處刊行國社黨的機關報，宣傳國社主義、同時白俄復辟黨首領西利洛維特茲，也親自到柏林與希特勒面商烏克蘭獨立運動，至於他們開始活動的根據地，就是捷克東端的盧森尼亞自治區。</p>
<p>希特勒所以極端度對波蘭及匈牙利要求分割盧森尼亞區而主張盧森尼亞成立，自治區的原因，一來是想分化波勾間的團結,但他方面也是爲着便利自己侵略的緣故，現在盧森尼亞已滿佈着德國國社黨的工作人員，更有大批被鼓動的烏克蘭人從波蘭移殖到盧森尼亞，與德國特務人員共同策劃活動，據說，德國最近將在該區設立特別軍事機關，目下希特勒旣巳，際地將捷克變成一個保護國，則在捷克境內做樹立烏克蘭獨立運動中心自然不費吹毛之力，但是他如何能迫波蘭就範，令其將烏克蘭民族聚居的地方劃入烏克蘭獨立國呢，關於這個問題常便希特勒感到宿字不安，據說，外長李賓特羅　為了此問題、將聘波蘭，從事遊說。</p>
<p>自盧森尼亞區成了德國軍事政治活動根據地後，波蘭南部，就感受到直接的武力威脅，加之國社黨人在但澤市的竊權和示威騷動，更使波蘭當局如芒利在背，侷促不安，同時在美末區選舉中，國社黨佔絕大勝利，美來華區委員會主席，巳由國社黨黨員柏杜隆充任，這個就是德國侵佔立陶宛的兇兆，而且德國現巳鎭壓住了匈牙利，經濟政治勢力巳透入巴爾幹各國，無形中使波蘭陷於孤立和納粹黨包圍之中、波網看淸這個弱　，故巳與蘇聯握手言歡，並努力與立陶宛訂立商約，立陶宛因爲德國有侵佔自已國土的野心，亦樂於和波蘭重條友好條約，去對這個共同的敵人，此外波蘭又極力聯絡英，法，羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫，企圖從新建立反德國法西陣線。</p>
<p>至於希特勒如何能使俄屬烏克蘭離說蘇聯呢！這是希特勒整個企圖的主題，同時也是他碰壁的地方，因爲烏克蘭區內的烏克蘭民族，自革命後，就享有完全的自治權，從來就沒有受過外族的壓迫，自五年計劃實行之後，烏克蘭區內的工業增加了五倍，在整個蘇聯中，烏克蘭人民是在革命後經濟建設受益最深的一個省份，故人民自然是很熱烈的擁護着蘇聯政府，不受外力引誘與個動，此外，德蠶一向利用作爲烏克蘭獨立運動領袖的人物，如西利　維特茲等，盡是革命前　虐貧民和大地主階級的代表，烏克蘭農民回想到往日的奴隸生活，尤有餘痛，今日自然絕對不會隨其殼中；受他們的愚弄，再蘇聯的國防强大，德國决不敢拚國迷作孤注之一擲。　爾從事活動，故現今希特勒唯一辦法，就是先用外交，經濟和武力，去吞併或壓迫或威嚇東歐各小國，尤其是匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，波蘭，及南斯拉夫立陶宛（捷克巳不成問題），打出一條直通烏克蘭的路徑，然後用外交或武力使佔烏克蘭。</p>
<p>德國扶植烏克蘭獨立運動，與日本之在中國設立滿洲國獨立運動如出一轍，今後的東歐，將成爲法西斯惡魔舞蹈的塲所，如果各小國不及早覺悟與團結，則劉免傾覆於歐陸法西斯狂潮之黑浪中，永無安寧的一天，但蘇聯爲世界和平的堡壘；她不但抱有拯救人類保衛世界和平的决心，而且還握有摧毀一切外來侵略的力量，假使東歐各小國能與蘇聯合作，反法西陣線能够迅速成功，則從波羅的海至黑海，就能崛起一橫歐洲大陸的堅壁，作抵抗希特勸東侵的堡壘，而此堡壘，就可成爲德國法西斯幣的墳墓，</p>

<p>改進三院財政管理</p>
<p>輔政司對普樂爵紳之質問、解答如次、增加東華三院之財政的補助疸、在相當時期、經已加以考慮、一九三六年初、東華醫院總理呈請政府、補助一九三七年經費不敷數目一十五萬元、政府經討論後、已同意于改進該　院財政管理之若干步驟、特別的同意下列各項、（甲）總理局應製備及遵行適當的周年預算、並應呈報經政府承認之核數員核定之周年財政部記、（乙）每年預算應先得經已成立之永遠顧問委員會核准、（丙）各院之醫藥及慈善工作應分別辦理、兩部應分別擬製預算、而兩部地址、在可能範圍內、應與東華醫院久享、盛譽之慈善工作、如救濟老弱貧千家萬乏及贈棺殮等之辦事地點離隔（丁）一切與各院醫藥行政有關之事務、將來須由總督委任之醫藥委員會主理、委員會經已委出、而委員名單亦經于一九三八年十二月十六日正式發表、委員包括醫藥局長或具屬員（主席）、東華醫院顧問二人、總理三人、華人醫院醫局視察醫官、及在東華醫院、東華東院、廣華醫院之掌院醫生、（戊）目前仍保留中醫中藥以備留醫病人自擇、（已）將來東華醫院之基金、將存現金、而不以按揭及物業作基金、</p>

<p>詳釋草案擬製目的</p>
<p>律政司宴禮伯提請通過各草案時、並加以解釋、謂此草案之擬製目的、係在結束總督府及市區發展基金、從該基金設置時之情形而論、此點實與公共利益有莫大關係、而總督亦經諭令本席將此草案作一詳明之解釋、該基金係準備支付市區發展（包括舊總督府政司署及舊大會堂等地址）之偉大計劃之建設費、大會堂地址一部份賣與匯豐銀行、其售價經已撥入基金內、而當時并決定將來將該地方別段售脫後、其售價之撥入基金內、當時希望售價可以抵填占督詂及政府機關合署及新大會堂之建設費、其後因故未能將該計劃實施當赫特傑爵士任總督時、提出其反對整個計劃之意見、表示不滿意於總督府及其附近地址之擴拓計劃、認為實無重建總督府之必要、因而該計劃遂告暫行擱置、</p>
<p>建設餘款撥歸公庫</p>
<p>督憲蒞任後曾將該問題重新予以考慮、經與本局非官議員討論後、即發表備忘錄、表示認建設新總督府為適當之意見、但同意於特傑爵士之反對發展總督府及其附近地址之意見、同時表明建設新大會堂以具一部份作官署之認可、該備忘錄指出基金之八十三萬認九千元、未能支付全部建設費、同時說明大會堂地址、其餘一部份售價、仍可撥作基金、然而專靠售價以支付建設費、已不可用、因而建議總督在改建費及所指定的地點發展展費、應由公撥付、而基金餘款、遂撥歸公庫、此計劃進行之決定、經見諸財政司關于一九三九年財政狀況備忘錄第十一節、財政司於本局討論預算會議席上、亦曾提及目前之草案、不過為一種法定手續、請示本局通過而已、其實定計劃、經已取銷、故該基金亦當結束、同時本席　報告各位、政府決意於適當期內建設新大會堂、但因地址尙未覓得、故須稍事遷延、但頃已進行考慮地址問題、一俟獲得決定後、即可開始建築云、</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>也曾以東方「蒙地卡羅」而膾炙人口的深圳——又生公司，是一個大賭窟，又是×我爭戰的大戰場，現在卻變成了收容難民的總匯。賑濟華南難民聯席會救濟組在這兒慘淡經營，已經兩在個月了，為着要檢視裏邊的情況和順便看看它刦後凄涼的殘跡，記者便跑到那兒來一個總巡禮。</p>
<p>上午搭着十點正開赴湖羅的火車，同行的有二十多個同業，另外有兩位中國青年救護團的女團員，加上愛談愛笑的林培生——賑難會救濟組的代表，還愁寂寞的嗎？車廂裏「咭咭呱呱」笑聲喧天，沒多時車已到達羅湖了，下得車來通過了沙包的高疊，鐵綱包圍的藩離，便見青天白日滿地紅的國旗高懸在鐵柱上。配合起艷　，藍雲，綠樹，野田，週遭都佈滿了愉快，佈滿笑意。是的，祖國於河山，是可愛的！是值得人依戀的！在鐵軌旁遠遠已經看到了又生公司底影子了，綠瓦紅強，矗立在車軌旁，四週的小河像一座彩玉的小帶綑着這座巍峨的宮殿</p>
<p>又生公司，雖然它內裏是蛛綱　封，坍塌頹倒，但它還是披着美麗的外衣，還留着令人感慨的歷史呀！</p>
<p>潔凈的難民室</p>
<p>踱過又生公司的右　，圍着竹欄處便是難民收容所了，裏面共分設五所，收容着三千多個難民，深圳戲院的戲堂闢作第一收容所，裏面全用着木板搭着兩層高的「碌架床」，每床是兩個人的睡額，戲堂裏很寬大，光線也頗覺充足很新的「碌架」床，更敷上簇新的草蓆，令人感到乾潔的愉快，室外雖然是蒼蠅橫飛，室內倒不大見它滋擾的影子，這實在是一個很好的現象，負責人還悄悄的告訴記者說，前鎰港當避和醫務總監到所裏巡視，沒有拿手織兒掩鼻，和新界時比起來說，這實在是一個顯著進步的一個明徵啊！</p>
<p>我的衣髒極了</p>
<p>在難民的睡室裏看不見蒼蠅子，一跑出難民室的門外，便是這些汚穢的轟炸機——蒼蠅追逐着那些難民，有點依人不捨的神氣，記者奇怪起來了，難道蒼蠅會怕室內新的　蓆的氣味嗎？唉唷，一陣霉菜味像毒氣般鑽進了人的心肺，差不多要把人悶倒了：這位難民看見這個情形，苦笑着說道「先生，我的衣服髒極了，從逃難起到現在還未掉換過呀」：記者定了定神問他道「那末沐浴嗎？」他毫不猶豫的說「沒衣服換懶得管它了，而且這水常是鬧荒的，差不多連灌口水也成問題啊！」</p>
<p>記者望望他那黃垢的牙齒，黃黑黯的嘴臉，真有點令人害怕起來，「水的確是成問題的啊！」記者一面跑一面想，可是後來在很多地方都看見一些女難民在洗着頭髪，再跑去別處詳細的查看，纔明白水荒還不像那位難民說的那麼利害，不過衣服非常的欠缺是真，聽說因為衣少人多，所以每次派衣服的時候，都像飢民搶飯一般，一閧便沒了，大概有些難民因為領不到衣服，所以素懶得沐浴的，所以我們非常希望熱心人士，多捐一點舊衣送去，同時還希望裏面的負責辦事人，取一種強烈的辦法，難民無論如何，每隔多少天，一定要沐浴，這樣難民的衛生和潔凈便可以臻拉完善的地步了。</p>
<p>猪肉味也未嘗過</p>
<p>看完了這五所難民室，便轉到飯堂那邊來，方長的飯堂，是用着葵竹來蓋搭的，裏面擺列着一堆一堆紅瓦磚頭，「怎麼。打石嗎？」一位同業忍不住笑的問道，「打甚麼石？那些是飯桌，那些就是坐椅了，」負責人一邊指劃着一邊說，卻原來石檯石凳配合起那圍繞的綠樹，這個飯堂倒很有趣，難民到食飯的時候，便一隊一隊的開到這兒，看來還合次序，不過他們大多數人還是嚕囌着一豬肉味也未曾嘗過，每餐都是青菜大荳呀！」聽說從十五日起增加一味肉類，難民從此可無須嘆食無肉了，</p>
<p>難民是知識淺陋約，我們當然期望負責人盡量的增加給他們的肉食，最要緊還是設方法使他們明瞭自己的處境，那末他們便不會那麼樣的貪得無厭了。</p>
<p>我沒有戒口</p>
<p>醫藥方面是中華醫學會派人輪流在智難民服務，另外還有留醫的病房，這個病房設在診脈處的樓上，留醫的病人，着睡新帆布床，蓋着新棉被，空氣總還不差，還有每人的床頭擺着一個熱水瓶，一切都很週到，他們是相當的舒適的。現在建築中的，還有難歸留產室，將來醫藥方面的設備，自然是非常完善的，不過現目還感到不夠的，就是病人的「戒口」，有幾個難民曾對記者這樣的要求過。</p>
<p>怎樣訓練難童</p>
<p>在一塊空地上，一羣男女的難童。正在表演柔軟體操，他們穿着雜亂和破數差不的衣服，還有些女孩，還是拖着辮子的，一面喝着口號，一壁在動着，這是一幅多麼有意義，而又有趣的圖畫！聽說最初他們的父母都不肯放他孩子出來訓練，幸虧負責人出辦法　他們說派餅乾給小孩，於是全所裏面的孩子都來，便趁着這個機會，把他們的孩子留下來，開始訓練他們。到現在已經有很顯着的成績了。另外還有一個難童學校，是快要開辦。難童的教育，也獲得解決了</p>
<p>難民技術登記</p>
<p>在難民所裏，很多是有着各項專門技藝的，現在所裏已在積極的登記和開始利用他們，像做木蓋棚和泥水等工作，凡是所裏須用的人材，大部份是從難民裏挑選出來服務的。另外還在籌備着養豬和種菜的各種工作，充分發揮難民的生產能力。關於文化的食糧，現在已經建立了一所小型圖書館了，將來還繼續的擴充的。</p>
<p>最後，我們感覺到這個難民所在這麼短促的時間而有這麼　的成績，這是非常難能可貴的了，不過，上述各種的缺點，我們還熱切的希望，能夠積極的加以改善啊。</p>

<h3 id="c53">南昌見聞錄 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 史沬特萊著　譚子濃譯</p>
<p>—中日傷兵及其他—</p>
<p>（一）第二救傷站一瞥</p>
<p>在晚上八點的時候，我停留于南昌第二救傷站，那裏的職員很忙工作。其中有八百傷兵，這一個救傷站爲南昌數一數二者。南昌共有九個救傷站，傷兵整排整列的臥在巨大的房間裏，這一個救傷站本來是一間學校。他們所臥的床爲中國床——卽是用兩張木長凳來支持一塊大木板的板床。床上置一葵褥，褥上蓋以一蓆。軍醫處發給每一個傷兵與一張棉被，但有三百張爲南昌市民所　的。樓上樓下都有男女歌詠團歌唱，以娛傷兵。毗近我們的一隊爲兩個女入及一個老人所組成的。老人拉着胡琴，女人唱着歌曲，其中一個是盲目的。她們唱的多爲民歌。她們且行且歌，間雜以以許多愛國歌。這裏的傷兵俱爲來自德安前綫，同時也是廣東軍隊的健兒。</p>
<p>（二）辛勤的工作人員</p>
<p>這個救傷站平均每月救護三千六百人。總幹事爲一個老軍醫。助勉而熱誠的工作着，這是他的自豪之處。他說，如果有大帮新傷兵到來，站內工作人員整夜工作的。那裏的工作人員有一個站長及一個副站長，四個醫生，二十個看護，及十個侍者，專司敷樂工作。站中的工作人員每月捐薪，以助重傷兵士的額外膳食。政府費用浩繁。熱心爲國的人們，也很甘心『枵馥從公』了。</p>
<p>江西抗×戰時服務聯合會的秘書在這裏報吿會中工作。這個聯合會在一九三七年八月所組織，直轄子省黨部。最近則擴大組織，包括許多戴亡團體，如動員委員會，據女生活促進會，婦女呼聲社，及戰時江西青年團等。這一個改組後的聯合會，有一個藥物救濟隊，四百個工作人員，勇敢的深入前綫的戰壕中工作，又有一個「募集委員會」及二個宣傳部，深入民衆，向兒童，靑年，婦女，商人，工人，及農民等宣傳。</p>
<p>「募集委員會」的工作甚爲顯著。政府命它募集十萬套棉衣，十二萬件棉背心。他們已經募集了八萬件　背心，及一萬六千套棉衣，俱是民衆自動輪將的。不過，幷不是募自南昌一地，　募自江西省各地的。他們希望於兩星期中完成其使命。</p>
<p>由香港經海防入滇路線</p>

<p>第一日海防至河內、三小時可達、河內旅館有同利天然、雙人房越幣三元、單人房一元半</p>
<p>（三）痛恨戰爭的日本傷兵</p>
<p>在一間醫院裏，紅十宇會的醫藥組料理十個日本傷兵。那個工作於　的醫生會說日語，因他曾在日學醫的。日本傷兵吿訴他許多不快意的事情，他們坦白的說：『我眞不知道爲什麼戰爭？』　我雖然來業參戰，但係我不知道爲什麼的。日本國內許多工廠巳總閉門，惟有軍需工廠日夜不停的開工，我們婦孺的生活是很困苦的！』眞是言下默歔者久之！</p>
<p>有一個日本傷兵俘虜講及他的父親的故事。他說他的年紀老邁的父親是一九〇五年日俄戰爭時的士兵，時常對他說及戰爭的可怖。這個俘虜說：『當我穿上戎裝，向我的父親拜別的時候，他放聲大哭了。我們這摩貧窮，而現在日本的物價又不斷的飛張，朝不保夕，怎能過活呢？』他複述到此，大有泣不成聲之勞。</p>
<p>另外一個日本傷兵俘虜，是生長於廣東的，他會說得一口　利的廣州話。當戰爭序幕初啓之時，他被召回國從戎，來華作戰，德安之役，因傷被俘，鏖戰之時，他聽到中國兵講廣州話。他害怕戰死，更痛恨日本軍閥的侵華，是以他走到中國軍隊的隊伍中來，用廣州話說明原委，請他們不要殺他。這是前綫歸來的廣東軍隊說出的故來事。</p>
<p>（四）遍處活躍着的中國抗戰精神</p>
<p>我們一起十多個人乘了汽車上前綫，同行幾位中國人可以聯得代表中國的人民了。一個是來自山東省的大學教授及其來自北平的夫人。兩個來自上海的學生，一個是中國書香之家的子弟。—個是來自蕪湖的農家少女。一個是中年的農民……農民游擊隊的組織者，一個是廣州小工人；他現在爲我們的司機，他勇敢的開足馬力，向前綫飛奔似的駛去。一個是廣　軍隊的高級政治工作人員。</p>
<p>入夜之後，剛剛天雨滂沱，我們的汽車向路旁駛出去，幾乎駛進河中，好在有一桿電綫柱阻止着，幸無『沒頂『之災。在雨中和黑夜裏，我們同心協力的開始工作了。我們拿野草和石塊去支持一個後輪，車夫則臥入泥濘的車底去，用汽車起重器扛起這輛脫了正路的汽車。我們的農民立即想起一個鏟，遂農到家借了一　回來，他　倥的從那個未壞的車輪後邊掘一個小溝。但是公路底砂石居多。我們彼此輪流的鋤掘，那個華民和教授指導着怎樣才易鋤掘的。兩個學生失敗了，而我的主要工作，除了鋤開路面的坭土之外，還要前前後後的巡親，因爲恐怕　綫柱一斷，我們的汽車很容易　落河中的呢！</p>
<p>我們一共做了三個鍾頭的『救車』工作。掘這一道小溝是很　的，掘　之後，未壞的輪駛下去，令到對方危險的輪起來，也沒有先前那樣害怕電線柱斷後，墜落河中去了。我們又在危險的輪側築一小堤；當我們的汽車回復正路之時，我們眞不禁歡天喜地而大聲歡呼起來。</p>
<p>在路中我們所掘的小溝。那位廣西政治工作人員大聲說我們一定要以泥土塡平才行，因爲隨後而來的（車會以爲漢奸埋地雷云云。我們遂以那個鏟，兩塊板和我們的手用捉土塡回原狀。那位齊香之家的子弟滿身泥濘了，那位教授的手也染滿坭土，我們的鞋和衣裳也被泥和水飛濺得骯髒不堪、其他的男女同伴亦如之。我們於是　濕透的靑草上措凈我們的手。大聲歡呼，重上征途，望看前線　進。這種精神——同心協力和不屈不撓的精神——就是中國抗戰的糖神啊！（特）</p>
<h3 id="c54">湘桂紀行（續） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 帥雨蒼</p>
<p>廣西在從前一般人的腦膜裏、是境處邊陲、地土確瘠、民性强悍、文化落後、但是當我們到了全縣、所見現象、適得其反、這裏的生活、簡單樸素、足以當之、記得雷賓南先生在廣西日報發表一篇『廣西地方文化研究一得』中所引證的廣曲通志一段說、男『廣西婚娉不重財、用檳榔猪酒遍分親挨、客至茶罷、進以檳榔、病事祈禱、喪尙浮屠、葬或疊石以圍其傍、祭祀所有陳供、無一定之　、精潔不及中土、大抵俗尙簡陋、服不尙御綺　、富貴之家遇吉禮則一御之、村民竟有畢生不一見者、飲食唯果腹、宴會止鷄　常品、屋宇用磚木、或用竹爲棟、爲楹、爲　、爲瓦、然不堅固、此外則茅簷土壁、古風猶存、爲士者一經自書、爲農者不知置藏、工則略習粗迹、商貿近在百里、未有遠涉以求利者、』查廣西通　、係淸雍正十六年編者、距今雖二百多年、此在撰佞居全一月來、覺得眼前人民的儉約、實與上段所叙、相差無幾、</p>
<p>全縣是廣西北境的入口、人口現正大增特增、房屋也與拌林同樣供不應求、當然的結果、房價日見高昂、現在城區淸湘鎭房屋每間約在三元至五元（法幣）、其他日常用品的高漲、自不待言丁、</p>
<p>關於廣西教育、現正蒸蒸日上、因失地的文化機關遷桂甚多、大中學校紛紛而來、各城鎭村落原已基礎學校林立、以全縣言、中學計有省立者一所、教立者一所、而最近武漢的縣會聯立中學又已遷來、這眞是廣西文化的福音、</p>
<p>四　廣西的交通</p>

<h3 id="c61">南華球員開始合宿訓練　準備夏間征澳洲　十七年前南華已征澳一次 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>（本報專訊）南華體育會足球隊第一次遠征澳洲、距今已十七年前事了、</p>
<p>那次南華征澳、可說是媾通體育外交的偉舉、亦是南華爲足球開發一條前進之路、</p>
<p>還記得那時候是一九二三年夏季、南華一行人馬、由英麽領隊、乘長風破萬里浪、向澳洲進發、而黄金時代方開始的李惠堂亦在征人之列、</p>
<p>踏上征途、經大小廿餘戰、採他人之長、補自己之短、逐獲得美滿成績而凱旋</p>
<p>歸來後、賡續參加一九二三——二四年度的甲組聯賽、每在競賽中、以其征澳時所得之經騐與技能、盡量發律出來、使各友隊望而生畏、莫足與敵、遂首次榮獲冠軍、</p>
<p>最近南華計劃第二次征澳、並已向前途接洽、甚有眉目、當可如願以償、</p>
<p>這次遠征、計劃頗大、擬先到南洋一帶如馬來亞及渣華等處比賽、然後移師澳洲、雖或征澳之舉、未能逆料將來有無變卦、然卽使成爲空談、而其南遊馬來亞及渣華則已决定事在必行的了、</p>
<p>因此、莫主任爲未雨綢僇計、前天召集一班球人、舉行座談會、商量出征大計、並决定由開會之日起、全體開始合宿訓練、以備將來出征、</p>
<p>出發日期、大約在本屆足球聯賽結束後、至於全部行程、至少須四個月、如單獨南遊、亦須兩個月的時間、</p>
<p>（球場太歲）</p>

<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>我們從事運動如欲收獲最大的效果、必須輕重　施『氣』　　並進、——氣卽「耐力」（　Starrfna）鍛煉「氣」和鍛煉「力」的方法不同、——</p>
<p>換　話說、我們一方面要使肌肉　維增大、發迷肌肉、一方面要促進身體的代謝作用、身體的代謝作用與肌肉的收縮　正比例、肌肉的消耗愈大、其效能的增進也愈大、也能使血液循環的作用正常和活躍、欲發　肌肉必須做需要「力」卽劇重而運動次數較少或時間較短的運動、歡促進身體的代謝作角、使血液循環的作用正常和活躍、即須做需要「氣」即輕易而運動次數較多或時間較長的運動、前　就是劇重的運動、後者運動的本身雖然很輕易、但如時間過久、也很劇烈、</p>
<p>運動過度能使身體的代謝作用過於活躍、於是使身體不能起正常的反應、血液循環的作用也受阻礙。這樣對於身體不僅無益、反而有害、由此可知、我們如一方面做發運肌肉和鍛鍊「力」的運動、即劇烈的運動、一方面也要以輕易的運動來促進身體的代謝作用使各部器官的功能正常和活躍、鍛煉耐力、否則能構成運動過度的弊害、</p>
<p>除此之外、構成運動過度的原因尚有兩種：（一）運動本身的錯誤、（二)身　營養和休息不足、</p>
<p>關於運動本身的錯誤、除運動的輕重多少外、不能使身體各部平均發達也是一個原因、（上）</p>
<h3 id="c73">電影與戲劇 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>娛樂……原野風光</p>
<p>South　Riding</p>
<p>年來英國影片已有長足的進步、像元旦在本港放映的「金鼓雷唱」和本片、便是很好的例說、「原野風光」本是一部文學名著、作者Wfnfred　Hoitby是一個極關心社會輿政治問題的作家、片中所描寫的、是反映着一個標準的英國鄕村、在那里有着　頑豪華漸趨沒落的地主、和貧病交集的村民、還有着大量沒機會受敎育的孩　、居處在毫無衛生設備污穢不堪的地方、片中更描寫着　班熱心社會事業的人們、怎樣努力的謀改造這個鄉村、同時揭穿了那些專說漂亮話、而對自己的行爲尙且不能負職的小人之蜚自私自和的黑幕、</p>
<p>主要演員像安娜籍絲、和羅夫李却遜、演出也稱得優秀精鍊、其餘各演員、也各有相當之成就、</p>
<p>皇后平安　周映英宮六十年</p>
<p>Sirty　Glorious　Years</p>
<p>本片同是寫英女王維多利亞一生的光榮史蹟、不過比較前一部更爲詳盡而已、將她在位六十年中許多重要的功績、都包括在內了、爲鄭重與畢眞起見、特由英國皇家公司攝製、却多少帶一點宜傳英國女王歷史的色彩了、</p>
<p>因爲素材特別蜚當、而那種素林都　寶　、不容得揎去或刪去、那麽在這種情形之下、導演是不容易討好、及處理得當、本片就犯了這个毛病、全劇除前半部寫女皇婚後生活、稍見生動活潑之外、在後半部祇好像劇歷史片段、作爲機構的介紹而已、這也不能怪導演的手碗了、</p>
<p>全片有幾個很優越的楊面、如女皇婚後的生活、英國皇家軍的衝　、女皇舉行　禧紀念及後去看她的老宮女等、都値得提起的、演員方面、同前一部「英后偉史」沒有都大更動、飾女皇的安娜娓格兒、演出絕佳、尤眞是在老年時、飾阿　伯親王的安東華爾勃　、也權優秀、</p>
<p>東方……戰後三友</p>
<p>Three　Comrades</p>
<p>同爲德國雷馬克氏繼『西線無戰事』、及『西築歸來』後之第三部不朽巨蓋、本片的背景是同前二部一樣在大戰之後之德國、</p>
<p>全片在導演飽才琪的襲活手段下、處理得那機　永動人、同時也有多少趣味的妙寫、特別成功的對於三位壯士的性格、抓得異常强固</p>
<p>演出方面、羅拔泰勒、佛蘭支通、羅技泰揚、都很努力、確是一部成功的作品、女主角瑪格蘭莎麗文、我們當然還記得她同約翰鮑須斯合演「舊怨新愁」裏的成績、這裏也有很大的收獲、</p>
<p>大華……賢明法官</p>
<p>Jndge　Hardy＇s　Chlfldren</p>
<p>故事的格局、無異「紅顏易老」是寫哈台接政府之電召、回京主持事宜、於是一家便由鄉下遷居到華盛頓、不幸哈台爲友欺弄、而女兒曼麗也差些誤於虛榮、受人之騙、兒子安德烈也鬧出一樓很詼諧的羅曼史、最後仍囘到故鄕、度着舊活、生</p>
<p>導演喬治希滋處理這一平凡的敎育故事、且有十分細膩的法手、在畫面上勾劃各個的個性、也很生動、而裏邊有些穿掃及對白、使歡衆特別感到與味、演員方面、最成功的是密蓋朗尼、西雪麗派克也很可愛、其餘幾個配角都稱　、</p>
<p>新世界……女人世界</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個女子公寓內、一般女寄宿者的故事在遣公寓內、包含着各式各型的人物、她們各有各的職業、但是複雜不堪、這其中有女學生、女記者、女推銷凡、歌、女舞女……等、舉員都市中所有的所業女人、在這裏包括殆盡、　雌粥粥、她們各有奢各的遭遇、說她是挪市中女人的一個結影、也未曆不可、但是全劇劇、情的進浪、因爲無男人之視托、顯得非常懈而勉强、引不起觀衆的興趣、同時本片也祗能描寫出一般女人的瞥通私生活、如擦紛爭吵、而對於廣遍的女性的描寫、始終沒有寫出、遺實在是本片失敗的惟一原因、最後因公寓的被炸、全體女人覺悟過來、聯合起來到前線去、也顯得不自然　且公式北、可是、話雖是這樣說、我們也得原諒編導者、以全體女性來演出一部戲、也是一件很困難的事情、</p>
<p>中央……鳥衣隊</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>又名風流媽姐、係描寫軍閥時代的專制家庭中、廣東某地的一件趣事、叙述一個有錢的老爺、旣擁着三妻四妾、還積極向傭婦追求、以致造成不少的風流艷史、劇作者的本意、一方面係描寫舊時大家庭中的醜史、一方面却儘量袖託出舊家庭中的傭婦的苦衷、我相信這種事情、在淸末民初的時候、時時有發現、因此本劇可說是一個實際的描寫、編導者自始至終、都非常盡　、演出成續也不錯、</p>
<p>太平……粵劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>
<p>日演……血洒官出神</p>
<p>夜演……寶鼎明珠</p>
<p>普　……粵劇</p>

<p>— 雲夫</p>
<p>日本的文化在牢獄中。</p>
<p>法西斯軍閥早已用爛了鐵棒子：幾年前小林多喜二好些人都活活地死在陰情的地獄裏。八一三以後，與小林齊名的中野重治，女作家中條百合子，以及年老的文壇權威秋出雨雀，江口渙等都先後下中了。軍閥們正在很謹愼地把文化用鐵鍊保存起來。</p>
<p>可悲的德永直却用酒精來麻醉自己度神經，僥倖免除了縲絏；但他深深地感到啞巴底痛苦。外村史郞，藏原惟人暫時停止了他們翻譯工作，在靜候着火山的爆發。</p>
<p>之外，軍部還積極地鞭策一班無恥的東西，投機家林房雄，佐藤春夫顯得活躍起來了；『文藝懇話會』的會談非常懇切，但隱藏不了志士（？）們底瑟縮地抖動。他們做什麼呢？菊池寬底『文藝春秋』雖然措去了「三角四角」的痕跡，然而他繼續從事於「一時的興奮」的工作，老調的文獻的效果和以前的正無二致：官方還組織了一個久米正雄主持的『筆的戰士團』，喜氣洋洋地來到中國，有幾位「戰士」聽到炮聲却嚇得溜跑了。</p>
<p>自然，他們在七年前，還參與過恭迎亡故將士忠該回朝的行列：掛着指揮刀，叱咤爲上，手中捧着黄綢包的盒子，那些凱旋歸來的武士臺變在上海戰塲上的臉孔，莫非是雄赳赳的，於是他們在旁邊讀嘆着，驅歌着，符合『君代樂』的拍子感動得下淚了…其間，很巧妙地又把人民眞正的苦淚互相中和一下，他們在歌頌『死的勝利』，姿態是傲然的；但文獻還是鴨蛋。</p>
<p>這囘呢，情形變了，雖然仍舊是鴨蛋：石川達三含糊地對一羣「未死的兵」，滴着絕望的眼淚：他們自己的骨灰不聞囘朝，戰事要延長多久呢？這樣，『未死的兵』終致鬧得本國滿城風雨。接着，懲戒；最後：帶罪立功！軍閥們曉得『文化在牢獄中』，外面沒有人了。</p>
<p>『筆的戰士』脚底下會明白的，他們慣於憑着『君代樂』的舊經驗在本國的報紙上大吹大擂，欺騙缺乏了眼淚的民衆。石川達三結果讓自已後身添了一根尾已，發揮得太窄了。</p>
<p>也莫怪「筆的戰士」本領不濟，不能歌頌得舖張揚厲，還包含嗚咽的調子；因爲題材如此，也不能挽囘的了。這裏的文獻卻在「筆的戰士團」之外的：</p>
<p>同文同種，本是手足的朋友；</p>
<p>軍閥惡魔，出無底的深仇。</p>
<p>衝　屠殺，百萬人化成灰，</p>
<p>譴罰如何不降於魔手？</p>
<p>靑大白日照耀於大地，世界和平的靑雲，何日展開？</p>
<p>千萬頭瞽眼在砲火中展開。</p>
<p>愛妻—我們要交頭相親，今生難再。</p>
<p>（見泉州二十日電）</p>
<p>此歌作者防空電　畏山田三郞非常雪亮：骨灰不能帶回是必然的：萬世一系的什麽要隨着泥足而坍塌了。</p>
<p>從此歌頌『忠駭回朝』已成爲歷史的陳跡，『筆的戰士』底尾巴遲早變作化石上的美麗的花紋。</p>
<p>山出三郞將被判極刑，又要到牢獄中去走一遭，實踐他底『今生難冉』，但這眞可惜得很，他們底一羣應走鹿地底路。作爲一個偉大的正義歌手下是最光榮的嗎？飛揚在牢獄之外的才是自由，靑天白日。</p>
<p>自然，『今生難再』的苦痛非此不足以解除；『未死的兵』中的從軍僧徒然的安慰，超度反正也是鴨蛋。一手執佛珠，一手捏鋼鏟的準會讓自己底魂來捧着自己的骨灰，當作『忠骸回朝』的。然而，『回』到那裏去呢？富士山要爆發了！離『成正果』實在太遠。爰略改濟顚圓寂詩猛喝之曰：</p>

<h3 id="c77">漁火 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡魯生</p>
<p>當夕陽啣接着無際的海波時，西天浮映着一抹燦爛的晚霞，鴉　匆匆從這暮色蒼茫的海空掠過，三三五五的漁船，互相連接地從海上回來了。在櫓聲帆影中，夜氣漸漸地彌漫了整個大地，彌澳了整個海空，一切景物由模糊而至不辨，已經是夜的開始了。</p>
<p>無數下碇在東博寮海峽裏的每個港　裘的漁船，每條船的桅桿上都掛着一盞　搖明滅的桅燈。高高低低，千盞百盞，像寒螢似的棲息在這黑越越的海面，和太海空中的星星互相爍着。</p>
<p>隨着海峽中夜風的流轉，海上時時吹來一陣陣抑揚頓挫，如泣如訴的「鹹水歌』，使人充份意識到漁民在歷史上和目前遭遇的悲苦，而寄予以無限的同情。</p>
<p>自從戰爭的血腥氣味吹入南海以後，爲着保衞她皇冠上最美麗的一顆寶石，已舉行了多少帶有示威性質的軍事演習，恬靜的夜，便常被炮聲和飛機的馬達聲所震盪着，黧黑的太空交奔着銀白色的「巨燄」矯　地往來搜索着它的目的物。岸上和水上的犬吠聲，更加深了黑夜的可怖！</p>
<p>靠近沙岸的地方，橫躺着三兩　正在修擦給底的凖備出海的漁船，週遭燃燒起幾朶烘焙船底的火花；從火光的映照中，可以淸楚地看見每條船的尾部，都貼着些紅色金邊的紙條；上面寫着『順風得利』或『浮居迪吉』等幾個水上常用的吉利字眼。艙面掛着盞暗淡的煤油燈，艙傍靜靜地安放一兩尊準備隨時予打擊者以還擊的土砲；它那古老威武的雄姿，雖在現代已失去它的效用，但仍不能不令人對它起肅然的敬意。</p>
<p>×××××××××，××××××××，雖然是「旺月」的來臨，但多數漁船，除了在無可奈何中，游弋於小得可憐的香港領海內，從事微乎其微的撈取外，眞正出海的漁船却很少；縱有冒險出去的，但都難保能『順風得利』的回來，—他們碰着×人時是十有九次弄得船破人亡。因此，多數漁船停　出海，畏期潛伏在港，裏度着愁慘的歲月。點點的漁火，正是多少漁民們傷心流淚忍飢受餓的所在。</p>
<p>陰森死寂的海裏，偶爾　來了一陣漁船升帆的轉纜軸聲，一艘龐大的漁船，衛破了夜的沉悶，　　地在移動着，尾樓上站着一個看不見的人，拿了已經燃着火的香燭紙錠，在上下搖動着向天膜拜——他們無助，他們不能得到任何人們的救援，他們在絕望中以能求佑於渺茫的神權。終於；在　吿兜後，燃奢的沓燭紙錠被拋入海裏熄滅了；船也即跟着開向黧黑無際的大海，直到它那桅桿上的燈光被黑夜的海</p>
<p>氣所吞沒。</p>
<p>停泊在東寮灣的漁火還是明　着，悲凉幽怨的漁歌還是飄着，生活，債額，死亡，焚掠，這些交相矛盾的思緒，正　住每個單純棧質的漁民的心頭……</p>
<p>漁火照亮了船邊滔滔的海水，也照亮了他們涓涓的淚滴。</p>
<h3 id="c78">『牛扒』 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 魯潑</p>
<p>本來『牛扒』這東西，早就爲一般人所耳熟能詳的，尤其是在這兒的歐化十足的社會人士當中，「牛扒』不過是很普遍的食品—一塊用刀背打鬆了的牛柳肉，煎過了，摻配上些洋葱靑荳和馬鈴薯等東西，再調雜着一點橘汁和芥末作味的肉食—通常在各家的西菜館（大菜間）裏，都可以吃得着的。</p>
<p>可是遭兒所說的，却是別僥風味的另外一種『牛扒』，雖然也是摻着『肉』的成份，不過這却是『人』的『肉』而不是『牛』的『肉』，而這種『肉的出賣』，也唯有在『人肉市場』中，才有。</p>
<p>這『牛扒』是這兒的『夜都市的一味特色新時菜』</p>
<p>是『靈』的『廉沽』，『肉』的『賤賣』，還摻雜着『血』和『淚』底『貼贈』！</p>
<p>每當華燈初上之候，電影院完場之時，在路燈掩映下的遼闊的街頭，在中等的酒吧（酒排間）和西菜館裏，通常有着些奇裝異服和濃粧艷抹的，打扮得七分不像人和三分不像鬼的女人們，在徘徊，在延位，在隱現……</p>
<p>每一個人沒有血色和沒有情感似的臉龐上，都厚厚的塗着一層白粉：每一張枯涸了的嘴唇上，都濃濃的染上一重口紅，雖然眉梢眼角間有時也浮動着一點微笑，可是，多麽的麻木，多麽的不自然，令人一看到就感覺看這只是飾假，只是虛偽。</p>
<p>雖然這笑是假飾和虛偽，但是她們一種誘惑的工具，一種「肉之沽出」的媒介當每一個路人經過她們身邊的時候，慣常的，她們總會巧練地拋過來一個眼波，一個帶着那假裝的和虛僞的微笑底眼波。</p>
<p>可是，當她們一眼看見這過來的並不是些「戎」裝革履的「語聲啁啁」的「舶來人』的時候，她們馬上就也許會把面色沉下去，這也許並不是她們的狗眼看人低，而實在是她們直覺地體會到這來的並不是她們希望中的主顯，他們都是感覺到給你這「流盼』的「善意』，是枉費，是徒然。</p>
<p>有時，當那些像『笨牛』般的「舶來人」眞的來了的時候，他們在那一煞的「流盼」以後，接着就是進一步的兜搭，有此快馬的，在三兩句「言語」下，也有「如意卽成的」的，於是，一隻細小的手從這腰脅下，「兜了過來，又一隻粗大的臂膀從那肩膊上「搭」了過去，『買』的和『賣』的就遭樣『搭兜着』去完成他們最後的交易。</p>
<h3 id="c79">評文藝陣地二卷七期 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 文會</p>
<p>二卷七期的文藝陣地以很充實的姿態供獻給我們，在那裏，最值得指出的是丁玲的「冀村之夜」，她寫述着一個游擊隊（還未健壯地長成爲模範戰列的隊伍）所犯了違反抗日統一戰線的綱領的錯誤，對於不規則的散軍沒有用政治工作的手段把他們糾正，爭取他們，却給予了一個不適當的措置，正如作者的附記所說：「游擊是好的，但難免偶爾也有不好的地方，因此它就暴露那「不好的地方，然這客觀現實是通過作者主觀的把握來表現的。我們應該强調的是這作品的敎育性；文藝工作者更應該從這方向加大努力。蕭曼若的犧牲精神」是企圖用諷刺來刻畫一個抗戰中的新官僚——曾×長，這種『新的抗戰官僚，新的發國難財的主戰派』（茅盾）和漢奸同等有害的蛆虫，應該畫出他的「臉譜」來的；蕭曼若這個創作的主題就在這地方，作品中的主人翁——曾×長——他旣在前線工作，又極度怕死，一聽見飛機響就躱起了；但他又願意『永遠戰爭』使他可以『永遠工作』，二十年便可以賺十六萬八千塊了。我們覺得這位人物有了過大的矛盾。使人感到不眞切，還未能達到『典型創作』的成功。</p>
<p>茅盾的短論『公式主義的克服』，其實就是一篇深入淺出的『典型論』也就是最精確的創作指導，他指示了「一篇作品由孕育以至成熟，終于產生的順序」，當人物孕育的過程，「當然甲不復是原來的單純的一個甲，乙亦不復是原來的單純的那個乙，而是甲之中有乙，乙之中也有甲，成爲非甲非乙但又似甲似乙之另一個丙了」，這就是「典型」的「孕育」，「我們試來意識的地分析這一個丙的性格，並從這一個內的行動（就是以甲乙等人爲中心的曾經發生過的事情）試來分析那些事事的意義，結果是發見了A及B了』，『我們便打算以AB或爲中題來寫一爲東西。」在這裏，我們創作的順序，是先由『綜合』，錯施「分析」，然後再來一次新的「綜合」。——我們不要錯認；A或B是要作作品的「主題」，而不過是作品的「題材」，所以終舍是經過新的「綜合」。他繼續說：「先自定了A或B（這可能是讀了社會科學的論文，或者批評論文而得的）然後去找『人物』去找『事件』，結果你也可以寫成一篇作品，但是往往就有公式主義的危險。』這短短的論文是提供了作家創作的基本法則。</p>
<p>杜埃的「論新形勢與作家生活實踐之强化」是一篇較大型而結實的論文。但作者只一般地論及政治上的新形勢，却沒有在文藝陣線的『新形勞』這特定的範疇展開討論，對這切要的問題，文藝理論家是應該加以注視和深廣的展開討論的。我以爲把論題明確地規定爲文藝陣線如何配合新階段，恐怕更來得具體和切要吧。</p>
<p>輸到那短小的一叢隨筆和報吿，其中三篇都是關于廣州失陷前後的，雖在藝術上顯得粗疏，但主要的爲在暴露（簡直地迅速地），次要才是藝術的手法。這才能顯得「深山大澤』「無奇不有」；因此捨「典型」而取「類型」，這在抗戰文學的任務和需要上是應有的。</p>
<p>艾靑的『給畫家們』，對『造型藝術』的落後（新興木刻除外）作者有了痛心的不滿。他指出「傳統的中國繪畫，是一貫地叛離了人羣的福利，萬事服役于權貴的娛情與努力着個人自欺的滿足」。他呼籲畫家們應「和舊的傳統搏鬥，和市儈的藝衛傾向搏鬥，而献身于服役廣大民衆，服役覺醒人類的們爭意志」。作者對于遙遙落後的造型藝衛工作者加以痛楚的鞭撻一，在這時候也是最大的需要，文藝界對于繪畫界的提挈與帮助，應該更加擴大。</p>
<p>任鈞的短劇『出發之前』，情節有　湊巧，但在新　荒的情况下，也就是沙漠中的甘電吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Great Significance of the United States Actively Joining the Democratic Front <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the frenzied actions of aggressors in the world have compelled other peace-loving nations to form, unexpectedly, a democratic front to resist aggression, its primary constituents being Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The attitude of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in supporting the democratic front and cooperating with each other has been evident for some time, due to their interconnected relationships in Europe and their ties as members of the League of Nations. The United States, however, due to its geographic location and its status as a non-member of the League of Nations, has historically adopted a more passive attitude toward supporting the democratic front. However, as a result of the rapid development of the international situation, aggressive nations are scheming to unite more closely in order to collude for evil. Peace-loving democratic nations naturally feel the threat of these mad aggressors more keenly, and also realize that isolation and division are not viable strategies. Nations that have already joined are cooperating more closely, and nations that have not yet formally joined are bravely and actively doing so, bringing even greater strength to bear. This is an inevitable trend in the development of the international situation, and it is also the basis for the United States' necessary active support of the democratic front.</p>
<p>The foreign policy of the United States in recent months has gradually revealed the direction in which it should move, but it has not yet been embodied or activated in concrete terms. Even President Roosevelt's repeated attacks on aggressors in the world have not yet gone beyond the scope of passivity. The most active expression of this should be President Roosevelt's repeated remarks and policies since the opening of the U.S. Congress, especially his secret remarks yesterday in the Senate Military Affairs Committee meeting. According to information leaked from various sources, President Roosevelt will adopt a new foreign policy, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Defining a policy toward Europe: If something happens in Europe, the United States will be willing to do its best to support the democratic front to resist dictators; (2) Requesting the Senate Military Affairs Committee to designate France as the United States' front line to cope with future wars between democratic countries and dictatorial countries; (3) The United States has decided to sell aircraft and other military supplies to France and other democratic countries. The publication of these messages has aroused different reactions in countries around the world. The impact will bring about an epoch-making change in international politics, and its significance is undoubtedly great.</p>
<p>Regarding President Roosevelt's epoch-making foreign policy, the first thing we should recognize is its certainty. The emergence of every country or policy is not a subjective expression of a political party or an individual, but a reflection of the objective facts of the country and the international situation at that time. Moreover, the implementation of each policy requires the support of this objective situation. The certainty of President Roosevelt's new foreign policy lies in this. The times have pushed the United States out of the circle of "isolation," and the United States must participate in the international group that is threatened at all times, because the United States itself is also under enormous pressure and future disasters due to this international threat. Germany, Italy, and Japan are not only oppressing China, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, but also directly and indirectly damaging the interests of the United States, and are even actively attacking the United States. The more these democratic countries are oppressed, the more dangerous the United States becomes. Therefore, the active participation of the United States in the democratic front is also to defend its own interests. Bittman argued: "If democratic countries are not given the opportunity to defend themselves, what is the difference between helping aggressive countries?" The New York World-Telegram even stated: "...Selling one plane to Great Britain and France is ten times more effective than increasing the same number of U.S. Air Force after June. We must know that the security of the United States is not in the Atlantic, but in Great Britain and France." These are indeed insightful remarks. Secondly, selling military supplies to democratic countries is not only helping the allied countries in this front, but also increasing the huge profits of arms dealers, which will surely get the support of the backstage bosses of the country's government. Therefore, the "New York World-Telegram" took the lead in writing: "This is not only Great Britain and France being the front line for our country's defense, but also benefiting us with gold. We are very fortunate to do this business." It can be seen that the American public opinion supports President Roosevelt's foreign policy very actively. This policy has both the objective requirements of the world situation on the one hand, and the subjective support of the American people on the other. Its future is too bright to wait and see, and the opposition of the isolationists will eventually lead to misery.</p>
<p>The second significance of President Roosevelt's new foreign policy is its huge effect that will occur. This point can be analyzed from two aspects. The effect in Europe is not only to strengthen the power of Great Britain and France, but also to strengthen the power of the United States itself. President Roosevelt said: "The front line of the United States is in France, just as the front line of Great Britain is in the Rhine." The closeness of their relationship can be imagined. This move by the United States can not only protect Great Britain, France, and other countries, but also protect the United States itself. Because Germany and Italy, who are deliberately disrupting Europe, are not only oppressing Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, but also preparing to attack the Americas. Japan, the aggressor in the East, with its occupation of China's territory and rights and interests, destroys the balance of power in the Pacific and wants to further threaten the Americas, which is also the result of the active support of Germany and Italy. In the Far East, if, as another message reports, "the U.S. General Staff is drafting a joint defense plan along the Pacific coast with Canada," then the U.S. national defense force in the Pacific will be greatly increased. President Roosevelt is already preparing to establish more naval bases in the Pacific. Its effect on determining the power to dominate the Pacific and preventing the rampant aggression of the Japanese aggressors has been analyzed in detail in previous articles. If the United States can further cooperate with Canada, it will not only gain military dominance in the Pacific due to the joint defense of the United States and Canada, but also increase further cooperation between Great Britain and the United States. There is another more important point about the possible effects in the Far East, which is to promote the practical cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union and to promote the active militarization of the Soviet Union. There are two reasons why the Soviet Union has not been able to actively launch military operations. That is, the democratic front has not yet been fully formed and the constraints of Germany and Italy in Europe. Now, the United States' support for the military of Great Britain and France is equivalent to actively participating in the democratic front, and at the same time, it is also curbing the arrogance of Germany and Italy and reducing the constraints suffered by the Soviet Union. If the League of Nations can resolutely implement the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant because of the United States' support for Great Britain and France, then the Soviet Union's military operations can not only be justified, but also have no worries, and it can defeat the aggressor's camp in one fell swoop. This is the reason why the Berlin newspapers attach importance to President Roosevelt's policy, and even the Berlin Evening News emphasized: "...Washington has become the center of the anti-dictatorial national movement." A Berlin local newspaper said, "Washington and Moscow are connected on the same line."</p>
<p>Finally, what we want to add is that the development of world politics is increasingly promoting the clarification of the boundaries between the democratic front and the aggressive front, so that every country knows what to do with its friends and enemies. We hope that those who guide the war of resistance or participate in the struggle will give more consideration and reflection to President Roosevelt's new foreign policy!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Disaster Situation in Boluo <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Rou Zhi</p>
<p>[Special Report] Boluo County has been occupied by Japanese troops for two months. Countless villages throughout the county have been ravaged, and even now, one corner of the fourth district near Shilong is still occupied. Before I came to Boluo, I had heard that the disaster situation in Boluo was the most serious among the counties in the Dongjiang area. Now that I have arrived in Boluo, I have seen countless refugees who are more miserable than those I saw in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Everywhere I look, I see broken walls and ruins. I already know a glimpse of the severity of the disaster in Boluo. Who knows that the results of the investigation are even more shocking! The details are described below:</p>
<p>Boluo County is divided into four districts. Let's talk about the county seat first. There are at least several hundred shops and houses that have been bombed and burned to the ground, and I don't know how many are half-standing and half-remaining. There are almost no complete ones; one thousand five or six hundred people have been shot and burned to death, and more than one hundred people have died unexpectedly of illness during the evacuation period. In addition, in the first district, there are rows of houses in Hengtian that were burned, and more than a dozen people were killed; in Jiangdong Township, fifty or sixty houses were burned; in Shuixi Township, dozens of houses were also burned. In the second district—Taiwei Township, all 160 or 170 shops in the market were burned, and several people were killed; in Qinvxiang Township, more than 20 shops in the market were burned, and 200 or so houses in the village were burned, and two people were killed; in Zhonglu Township, more than 30 houses were burned, and more than a dozen people were killed; in Lian'an Township, more than 300 houses were burned, and more than 20 people were killed; in Tutu Township, more than 30 houses were burned, and around Gongzhuang, four or five people were killed. In the third district—Xiangshui City, only one of the 120 or 130 shops in the whole market remained, and three or four people were killed; in Baitang City, more than 30 shops were bombed, and 22 people died; in Lian'an Township, the most houses were burned in Xinzhaotang and Gugang, about 1,500 houses. In the fourth district—Tian Township, all 90 or so shops in the whole market were burned, and more than 120 people were killed; in Changning, all 50 or so shops in the whole market were burned, and in Guoshi Township, all 80 or so shops in the whole market were also burned—readers, do you find these numbers headache-inducing? If you let yourself imagine the true content of these numbers, can you stop at a headache?</p>
<p>The dead are gone—what about the living? So many shops and houses have been bombed and burned. How many people will be homeless? It's really unbearable to think about—those whose houses were not destroyed, their rice and livestock were eaten by the [Japanese] soldiers during their difficult times. The utensils and supplies were looted by bandits. Even if they still have a home, they don't know how they will be able to survive, so, in the whole of Boluo County, the disaster is extremely serious. There are at least 50,000 refugees who urgently need relief—not counting those who can barely find ways to support themselves. According to reports from people sent by the county government to investigate: In the whole of Fucheng Township, only a few families can barely make a living, and all others are in urgent need of relief; there are many other townships that are almost the same. It's almost unbelievable to say it, but if you go and see it for yourself, you can't help but believe it!</p>
<p>Would you also like to know something about their situation when they fled? Let me retell the words of a few refugee women (their words are all mixed together, and I can't tell which sentences were said by whom)—</p>
<p>"Before dawn, at five o'clock in the morning, we got up early and quickly cooked and ate. Carrying sons and daughters, we also had to carry things, desperately running to the side of the mountain stream. We didn't dare to cook for the whole day, for fear that the smoke would be seen by the [Japanese] planes. We were very hungry, and the children couldn't bear it and cried loudly for food. But the [Japanese] planes were always flying overhead, and we were afraid that the [Japanese] would hear them, so we forbade the children to cry. Others were afraid of being implicated, and interfered even more severely. The parents had no choice but to cover the children's mouths. Some used too much force, causing the children to be unable to breathe, and they died in an instant—it was ineffective to cover the mouths of children who were too young, and they still cried. Some parents became angry and grabbed their necks with force, and many were strangled to death like this. The [Japanese] set fire to the mountains, and the fire was approaching our bodies. Everyone scrambled to escape for their lives. At that time, people stepped on people. I don't know how many old people and young children were trampled to death—some people with more children couldn't bring so many children because they had to run fast to escape, so they abandoned a few. No one paid attention to them, and they either starved to death or froze to death—hungry during the day and cold at night, with so many mosquitoes, they would get sick even if they didn't die—we used to think that thirst was a trivial matter, but we only realized at that time that thirst was as important and as unbearable as hunger. In some places, we couldn't find a drop of water, and everyone was dying of thirst. There was a girl of eight or nine years old who begged for water very urgently. Her mother used her hand to press her down on her lap, scaring her and saying that the [Japanese] planes were coming. She didn't expect to use too much force, and she pressed her down for too long. By the time she let go of her hand, her daughter had died! Fortunately, it didn't rain. If there had been heavy rain, and our clothes had gotten wet, and we couldn't sleep on the ground, even more people would have died of illness. After a few days of fleeing, many men disappeared. They often left their wives and children to go elsewhere to find a way. Because there were no men to protect them, it was easier for bandits to strike. Even the seven coins that a woman had were taken away, and of course she couldn't keep her earrings. Even tattered quilts were wanted by the bandits—some women's coats and pants were relatively new and clean, and they were forced to take them off, leaving only their underwear! There were a mother and three children who were so hungry that they couldn't bear it. The mother couldn't bear to see her children starve to death, so she sold the youngest one for three dou of rice!" The old woman who reported this incident shed a few tears when she got to this point. She continued, "What's even worse is that the three dou of rice that she got in exchange were robbed by bandits the next morning!"</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the recent situation of providing relief to the refugees in Boluo:</p>
<p>After the [Japanese] soldiers withdrew from Boluo, the refugees gradually returned to their old homes. At this time, the most urgent and serious problem was the problem of food. Many refugees didn't have a single grain of rice left in their homes. The Relief Committee of the Overseas Chinese Huiyang Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong knew the severity of the disaster in Boluo and quickly came to Boluo City to set up a relief station. They sent Zeng Tianxi as the director of the relief office. There were a total of four or five men and women working together. They were very serious about their work. At first, they provided meals, but later it was too troublesome to cook, there were too many people, and it took too long. The refugees who came from afar couldn't bear to wait, so they changed to distributing rice, about six taels per person, and they took the relief coupons to collect it. They have been providing relief for more than a month, and there were as many as four or five thousand refugees coming to collect rice at the most. People who were too far from the city couldn't receive it, so they plan to extend the relief to the countryside next week, which is indeed necessary. In addition, the county government allocated a portion of the public relief funds issued by the provincial government and provided porridge once every morning. There were fewer people who came to eat porridge than to collect rice, but there were at least 200 people at the least and 500 people at the most. Such relief is not yet widespread, and the original relief funds are about to be used up. I hope that overseas Chinese will donate more money and rice and continue to provide assistance!</p>
<p>The second is the problem of clothing. Most of the refugees have very few clothes to wear, and the same is true for children. When the weather turns cold, you can often see them shivering, which is very pitiful. I heard that overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong have donated several thousand cotton clothes and small children's sanitary clothes, etc., which will arrive soon. But there are tens of thousands of refugees, and these several thousand pieces are not enough to solve the problem. I hope that overseas Chinese will continue to donate!</p>
<p>The provincial government issued a portion of the public relief funds to provide porridge, a portion to provide work as relief, and most of it was to distribute cash to the refugees. They first investigated and registered, and then issued coupons, asking them to collect the money with the coupons. Because there was little money and many people, each person got very limited. In Fucheng Township, each person got only four cents and four mills of small silver coins. Some people waited for a day or two before they got this little bit of money. I feel very sad for them. Boluo, which has suffered a disaster, of course, it is difficult to raise money in the county to relieve the refugees, so we can only appeal to our compatriots who have not suffered a disaster in other places!</p>
<p>There is also a very big crisis, which is the problem of refugees' diseases. During the period of fleeing, they couldn't eat enough, didn't get enough sleep, had irregular lives, poor water quality, and mosquitoes were rampant. There were a lot of sick people, especially the old, weak, women, and children. The Shao Xun Overseas Chinese Rescue Team and the Dongjiang Rescue Team of the Huiqiao Rescue Association came to the county seat to diagnose and treat patients, provide rescue, and donate medicine. They stayed for a few days and left. They went to the countryside, and after they left, there was no one to treat the sick. Very few people were cured. When I came here this time, I was accompanied by a comrade from the Boluo Refugee Relief Association and brought three boxes of medicines, but unfortunately they were detained by the Shayu Chong Customs. I don't know how many lives have been delayed. We feel very sad. Here, at present, there is nothing more important than medicine. Even if those three boxes were shipped, it would still not be enough!</p>
<p>In the process of this relief work, the above-mentioned Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce, Myanmar Overseas Chinese Rescue Team, Huiqiao Rescue Association Dongjiang Rescue Team, and the county's Relief Committee, Refugee Relief Association, etc., have all made great efforts and demonstrated considerable achievements, which is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>What is especially worthy of praise is: the comrades of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Pioneer Team and the Boluo Wartime Work Team. The comrades of the Boluo Wartime Work Team went to the countryside in part and stayed in the city in part. They participated in the work of providing porridge and distributing rice every day, as well as distributing money these two days, and did not spare their efforts.</p>
<p>The comrades of the "Anti-Japanese Pioneer Team" recently came to Boluo from Huiyang. They have only been working for a few days, but they have shown their excellence and enthusiasm everywhere. In the past, the order was not very good when providing meals and distributing rice. After they arrived, they guided the refugees to sit in a fixed position and led them to collect rice in an orderly manner after the rice arrived, and then they withdrew in an orderly manner. The place where the rice was distributed in the past was very dirty. After they arrived, they swept all the houses clean and set up benches (there were many student benches there because it was the First Elementary School), so that the refugees would not feel embarrassed there. At the same time, they also preached to the refugees, and their attitude was very good, so that the refugees were very willing to approach them and were willing to accept their opinions. They plan to go to the countryside to serve in two days. I will travel with them, and perhaps there will be new things to see and hear, and I will report it then. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Guangdong's War Situation Becomes Tense Again. Our Army Actively Deploys. The Remaining Troops of the Dongjiang Area Have Been Transferred to the Beijiang Area. Wu Qiwu's Troops Have Arrived in Eastern Guangdong <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Fast News from the Enlightenment Society] In the northwest and southern parts of Guangdong Province, the violent [Japanese army], are stirring and attempting to find out the strength of our side and take the opportunity to attack the Guizhou Province. Therefore, the military authorities in South China are also stepping up their deployments for resisting [Japanese] aggression and war of resistance. In addition to equipping strong troops on each line to form a strong line of defense to frustrate the [Japanese army], they are now also preparing to launch a major counter-offensive by our troops in the East to break through the outer defenses of the [Japanese army] in the Dongjiang area and shake the [Japanese] position in Guangzhou in order to contain the [Japanese army] from developing in various directions in the northwest and south and crush the [Japanese army]'s conspiracy to invade Guizhou. The following is an exploration of the Dongjiang war situation.</p>
<p>The [Japanese army] in Zengcheng is Preparing to Retreat to Guangzhou</p>
<p>The [Japanese] army, under the command of Wu Qiwu, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, which is entrenched in Taiping, Zengcheng, and Shilong in Dongguan, has long been surrounded and controlled by our army and guerrilla teams in various districts. The reason why it has not been driven out in one fell swoop for a long time is to comply with the established strategy of the highest military authorities to trap and consume the [Japanese army]. Now that the [Japanese] army in Guangzhou is plotting to move westward to Guizhou Province, it is believed that the time to annihilate the [Japanese army] has come. Therefore, orders have been issued to the military teams stationed on the entire line of Huizhou, Boluo, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Shi[long] to launch a large-scale guerrilla annihilation war immediately. At the same time, orders have been issued to the troops attacking Zengcheng and guerrilla teams to step up their encirclement and suppression of the remaining [Japanese army], annihilate them as soon as possible, and take advantage of the victory to attack Guangzhou. It has been found that there are about 2,000 [Japanese army] troops in Zengcheng. In recent days, the [Japanese army] has been very frightened by our army's active preparations for a major counter-offensive. Knowing that its strength is weak and it will be difficult to resist stubbornly, it is now preparing to retreat when necessary. According to [information], the [Japanese army] in Guangzhou has recently sent a large number of engineering teams to build fortifications and fortresses in the suburbs of Nangang, Fuhe, Longyandong, Xiaoping, Baiyun Mountain, and Shijing. The situation is very embarrassing. Judging from its intentions, it seems that if the front line is lost, it will retreat to Guangzhou to resist stubbornly.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Wu Inspects the Front Line</p>
<p>It has also been found that Wu Qiwu, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, has decided on a plan to counter-attack Guangzhou since he led his troops to Guangdong some time ago. Commander-in-Chief Wu is also inspecting the front line defense and instructing the military on the essentials of offense and defense. He departed from a certain place in Dongjiang on the 20th of last month to inspect Heyuan, Hailufeng, Huiyang, Boluo, Xinfeng, and once went to Luofu Mountain to inspect a new mechanized division. Those who accompanied him included Zhen, the fourth army, and many senior staff chiefs. He has recently completed the inspection and reported to Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui about the arrival of his troops in Guangdong and consulted on all matters of the War of Resistance. He took the Dongjiang route to Shaoguan the day before yesterday to pay a visit to Commander Zhang to request instructions on various matters.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Military Affairs in Dongjiang</p>
<p>It has also been found that Zhang Fakui, the commander-in-chief, has designated Wu Qiwu, the commander of the 9th Army Group, who has led his troops to eastern Guangdong and has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, to be in charge of the military affairs of the Dongjiang counter-offensive. In order to adjust the military affairs of the front line and re-divide the tasks of the War of Resistance, it has been designated that the Mo Zhen, Zhang Deneng, Chen Rongji, Li Hanhun, Chen Gongxia, Wang Dequan, Ye Zhao, Tan, Hua Zhenzhong and other troops who accompanied Commander Wu to Guangdong this time will be under the command and control of the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route to take charge of the counter-offensive against Dongjiang. The two divisions of Huang Tao and Zhang Ruigui, and the two brigades of Xian Wenshu, Hai Liangcai and Lin, which were originally fighting there under the 12th Army Group, will be ordered to be transferred to Beijiang and will still be under the control of Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the 12th Army Group and commander-in-chief of the Northern Route, to take charge of the military affairs of the Northern Route counter-offensive.</p>

It is reported that the Japanese army is now building several military bases. Foreign observers said that the Japanese army is stocking up with military supplies and various materials in Nanjing, Wuhu, and Hankou for application. It is also reported that the Japanese army plans to clear up the Chinese plainclothes teams operating in the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei.

Later, the [Japanese army] continued to increase its forces and attacked Liaoxian in three routes at dawn on the 30th. A fierce battle broke out with our troops. Because we were attacked on three sides, we gave up Liaoxian immediately. The [Japanese army] continued to invade the south with more than a thousand people. It has now reached Lianggu Village and is fighting with a part of our [Japanese] Division. Another part of us is still confronting the [Japanese army] near Liaoxian City.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Chongqing, 2nd] According to reliable military sources here, General Ma Zhanshan will soon be able to reach outside the Guan and continue to lead a large army to fight the Japanese. It is reported that General Ma's Vanguard Army is an extremely excellent Northeast cavalry, and the members are currently fighting the Japanese army in western Sui, making great achievements and winning victories, and have arrived at the border of "Manchuria".</p>
<h3 id="e5">Yantai Chinese and Foreign Merchants Suffer from X Party's Oppression; Export Permits Cannot Be Obtained; Commercial Vessels Often Depart Empty <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd] The puppet government of Beiping has decided to apply the Qingdao method of restricting foreign exchange for exports to Weihaiwei and Yantai. The main reason is to maintain the value of the banknotes of the puppet "Federal Reserve Bank of Beiping." All foreign exporters must purchase foreign exchange from the Yokohama Specie Bank at a higher exchange rate. According to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, Japanese, Chinese, and foreign exporters are treated equally. It is heard that two British commercial vessels departed from Yantai for Shanghai without any cargo because the local authorities refused to issue export permits. This is because foreign exporters refused to purchase foreign exchange from Japanese banks. It is also known that this restriction is only implemented in Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai. Tianjin, the largest port in North China, is not included in this regulation. It is expected that the port has foreign concessions and foreign banks, so trade is naturally more free.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd] Regarding the incident of a Japanese warship intercepting a British vessel and two Norwegian vessels, a Japanese military spokesperson said that the British vessel "Paul" did not stop when it was stopped by a customs anti-smuggling vessel, and immediately sailed out of territorial waters. The spokesperson believed that this interception method was legal and stated that the Japanese military did not directly participate in the matter. He also denied the British captain's report that the Japanese warship escorted the vessel to Qingdao, stating that this was just a coincidence because the Japanese warship was also ordered to Qingdao at the same time.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from our Shanghai newspaper, 2nd] The puppet organization in Suzhou is levying land taxes, but since Li Chaoyuan, the puppet district head of Nanbeiqiao, was shot by guerrillas, farmers in the surrounding villages have been hesitant to pay taxes. Peng Gusun even requested the puppet army to go to the villages to protect the tax collectors. The Xietang Township Tax Collection Bureau near the Kuatang Railway Station also requested the assistance of the puppet provincial police team to collect taxes as usual. At that time, the Bao head, Zhang Boquan, gathered two to three hundred farmers to surround the puppet police team and resist. The puppet provincial police team, relying on their superior weapons, opened fire, killing six farmers on the spot. Zhang Boquan, Jin Xiumen, Shen Jinshi, and others were arrested and taken to the Second Pacification Command of the puppet regime. After being interrogated and falsely accused of being communists, they were brutally murdered. Furthermore, more than 30 silk merchants were arrested outside the gate and imprisoned in the puppet police station, where they were subjected to severe torture. Under this tyrannical and cruel government, the people of Suzhou's four wings will have no way to survive.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Yu Hanmou Discusses Guangdong Province's Troop Source Problem; Military District Affairs Have Been Transferred to the Provincial Government; Conscription Will Surely Be More Effective in the Future <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Correspondence from the Min Ge News Agency] This reporter recently accompanied a political work brigade to inspect the front line. On the way back in ××, it happened that Yu Hanmou, Deputy Commander of the Fourth War Zone, and his staff members were also returning from inspecting the defenses on the front line. As the general counter-offensive in the South China War is about to begin, the issues of troop adjustments, troop replenishment, and the cooperation between guerrillas and regular troops are of great importance to the long-term War of Resistance. Therefore, I asked a staff member to introduce me to Mr. Yu and inquired about the recent facilities of the Guangdong Military District and the Self-Defense Corps Management Office, which are responsible for handling this task. Mr. Yu received me in the dim light and answered the reporter's questions as follows:</p>
<p>He said, "The people of Guangdong Province have always been rich in revolutionary spirit and extremely brave in combat. Since August 13th, many troops from this province have been transferred, and the number of soldiers replenished has been very large. Due to the lack of a perfect household registration system, conscription is quite difficult. However, while I concurrently served as the commander of the military district, I strictly supervised the conscription personnel. Selections and conscriptions must be carried out in accordance with legal procedures. Those who deviate from the norms will be strictly investigated. Over the past year, a large number of new recruits have been replenished, and fortunately, the supply has been continuous without interruption, and social order has not been affected. This fully demonstrates the patriotism of the people of Guangdong, which is extremely strong. The future of the War of Resistance is promising. However, conscription is closely related to administration. If an astute and capable civil affairs official is responsible for handling it, it will surely be more effective. Now, the affairs of the Guangdong Military District have been ordered to be transferred to the provincial government, and Chairman Li is responsible for presiding over them. In the future, the system will be consistent with the ideal, and the replenishment of troops will surely have better results, and there will be no shortage. As for the organization and training of the self-defense corps in this province in recent years, it has a considerable foundation. Last August, a pacification conference was held, convening senior civil and military officials from the entire province, and it was decided to use the self-defense corps as the backbone of the wartime guerrilla forces. Plans have been made for the preparation and methods of guerrilla warfare. This time, they have assisted the national army in resisting × in various places, and their achievements have been widely recognized. Recently, such as the recapture of Huizhou, Huaxian, and Conghua, and the defense of the Xijiang South Road, our national army has greatly benefited from the self-defense corps. However, in my personal opinion, the arming of the people belongs to the scope of civil affairs and should be handled by the provincial civil affairs department, which will be more effective in the future. Therefore, it was decided at a recent meeting to transfer it to the provincial government, and Chairman Li is responsible for handling it. Chairman Li comes from the military and has excellent talent and knowledge. It is very appropriate for the self-defense corps to be under his leadership. It is hoped that in the future, when assisting the national army in combat, there will be even more outstanding results. Finally, Mr. Yu also said, "Whether a system or method is good or bad has no absoluteness. However, in order to move towards perfection, it all depends on the integrity and efforts of the responsible personnel themselves, and the guidance and criticism of good public opinion in society. Therefore, I hope that responsible personnel at all levels will make more efforts, and society will guide public opinion at any time," and so on.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from our Shanghai newspaper, 2nd] According to a report from the United Press in New York, the agency's correspondent in Chongqing recently met with Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi.

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] A Japanese naval spokesman here declared that the Japanese side has notified the airlines with third-country rights in China to ensure that their planes do not fly within a 50-mile radius of Weizhou Island and that the flight altitude in other areas must be maintained above 5,000 meters to avoid the unfortunate events of past misidentification. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese occupation of Weizhou Island is solely for the purpose of preventing the Chinese side from using civilian ships to smuggle military supplies, and therefore it is only a temporary strategic occupation.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] It is rumored that the National Government will make some important personnel changes after the Fifth Plenary Session.

After that date, they will not be responsible for ensuring their safety.

<h3 id="e21">Wu Peifu's Speech Was Entirely Fabricated by the X Party; Aimed at Deceiving Chinese and Foreign People <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] A Chinese military spokesman declared yesterday at a press conference that "General Wu Peifu will only have hope of coming out of retirement if the Japanese side agrees to restore China's administrative integrity. General Wu Peifu's speech was entirely fabricated by the Japanese side." Chinese newspapers here this morning prominently published various reports about the Japanese side's fabrication of Wu Peifu's speech. Chinese people do not believe that Wu has lost his integrity, because Wu has never considered becoming a puppet of the Japanese side. The Japanese side's repeated propaganda is nothing more than deceiving Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 1st] Although newspapers here under Japanese control claim that Wu Peifu's recent speech indicated acceptance of Japanese demands and that he would come out to rally people, Wu's confidants said that Wu himself was extremely angry about this interpretation, saying that he had not accepted Japanese demands and had never demanded that the Japanese army must first withdraw from certain places in order for him to truly command. Some people said that Wu had never made any accusations against the Chongqing central government, but had expressed opposition to the Communist Party. Therefore, the Japanese government's attempt to use Wu to carry out a "peace" movement has not yet achieved success.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Xth Day, 2nd Month] Sources close to Wu Peifu himself claim that Mr. Wu Peifu has rejected Japanese demands and is unwilling to accept the position of "Chairman of the Pacification Committee." Mr. Wu has also set three conditions: first, that Japanese troops withdraw; second, that occupied areas be returned to China, including "Manchukuo"; and third, that Japan respects China's democratic system and diplomacy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Canqing, 2nd] Because X has been unsuccessful in its long-distance expedition, it has recently issued telegrams in the name of our people's organizations and famous figures in opposition, calling for peace. Looking at their intentions, they are trying to divide our strength in the War of Resistance. The people of North China have seen through their tricks and recently sent a telegram to the whole country, denouncing their schemes. The original telegram is as follows: All agencies, newspapers, and broadcasts to compatriots across the country are hereby notified. X has been unsuccessful in its long-term war, and its military and financial resources are becoming increasingly exhausted. Its diplomacy is also isolated. Out of desperation, it is eager to seek peace. Knowing that our government is firm and its treacherous schemes are not succeeding, it has recently issued telegrams for peace in the name of various people's organizations or famous figures in opposition, such as Wu Peifu, with language that is more moderate than before. However, X's military deployment is still relentless. It can be seen that X's purpose is to use peace as a lure, and it wants to divide our front line so that after we are disintegrated and discouraged, it can be slaughtered at will. Its tricks are extremely vicious, and there is no greater than this. We must see through X's schemes and persist in the War of Resistance to the end in order to achieve final victory. No matter how difficult, this aspiration will not change. Thirty-three groups of people in North China respectfully request.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Mr. Hu Yuzhi Speaks: The Current Situation of the War of Resistance (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Notes from our reporter</p>
<p>——At the Hong Kong YWCA the day before yesterday——</p>
<p>In the second phase of the War of Resistance, there is also a clear manifestation of progress in the political sphere. Politics is more important than military affairs, which is also a new national policy determined at the Hengshan Conference. Political improvement is indeed more important than military improvement.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the current political situation in four points:</p>
<p>First, in terms of spiritual strength</p>
<p>Accepting the blood-like lessons, our political and spiritual mobilization has been further strengthened, so that soldiers at the front and the people in the rear receive full spiritual training. Therefore, the government recently trained 50,000 young cadres to be assigned to various inland areas to engage in publicizing to the masses, training the masses, and organizing the work of the masses. To match the development of the new situation, at present, not only is the sentiment of common hatred for the enemy increasing, but those who doubt the War of Resistance are either determined to stand up or are eliminated. As for the spiritual strength of the × people, it is much worse. The Japanese warlords have repeatedly claimed that the war can be ended and China defeated in the shortest possible time. However, again and again, it still has not been realized, only causing the Japanese to develop war-weary emotions from disappointment, and anti-war movements are constantly occurring. This is a definite fact, and the spirit of the Japanese invading soldiers is far worse than before.</p>
<p>Take the prisoners of war as an example! In the early days of the War of Resistance, it was very difficult for us to capture prisoners of war. When it was absolutely necessary, the × soldiers would rather commit suicide than surrender easily. However, the prisoners of war captured recently have been much more numerous. According to reports from North China: × troops often surrender and disarm to us as a whole team. Compared with our fighting more and more strongly, it is not known how much worse they are!</p>
<p>Our heroic soldiers often receive orders to retreat and disobey the orders, rushing to the front line again to shed blood and sacrifice. This spirit is truly moving! Chairman Chiang repeatedly instructed at the Hengshan Conference that it is appropriate to be brave; however, one should bravely obey the entire sacred task. One should advance when one should advance, and one should retreat when one should retreat. Do not be emotional and make unnecessary sacrifices. From this, we can know that our spiritual strength is superior to that of the × people, and we have the certainty of victory.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of material strength</p>
<p>In terms of materials, our country is also increasing every day, while the × people are decreasing every day. Our national currency and finance are very stable, but the × people's cash has been cleared. The price of securities is also plummeting. The × people's general mobilization law was originally intended to concentrate the national manpower and material resources to invade China, but this is only the attempt of the warlords, and it has been opposed by the people. From the × people's frugality in materials, we can also know the depth of their panic. Although we have lost many places along the coast, our capital and industry are developing towards the southwest and northwest. The government has also formulated economic construction plans for the southwest and northwest, which are being actively implemented. For example, the establishment of a province in Xikang, highways, and railways are all under active construction. If it were not for the War of Resistance, we do not know when we would have begun to pay attention to the construction of remote areas! Therefore, from the perspective of material strength, we also have the certainty of victory.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of internal unity</p>
<p>When Wang Jingwei was first expelled from the party, the × people took the opportunity to spread propaganda that we were internally divided. In fact, because of the elimination of the backward Wang faction, our internal unity has become more consolidated. The × people are either spreading rumors that the National Government will be communized or that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will split. In fact, the Communist Party has long sincerely expressed its support for the Three Principles of the People, the Supreme Leader, and the National Government. No matter how the × people try to sow discord, they can only see their efforts come to naught. We are truly becoming more and more united as we fight, while the × people, on the contrary, are becoming more and more contradictory and divisive. The fall of the Konoe Cabinet is a clear example. Therefore, internal unity is also where our country is superior to the × people, and we have the certainty of victory.</p>
<p>Fourth, in terms of the international situation</p>
<p>From the beginning of the War of Resistance, the democratic nations have sympathized with us. However, we believe that sympathy in words is not enough. Therefore, we earnestly hope that democratic nations can further sympathize with us and help us. In fact, as long as we can stand firm, we will definitely be able to get spiritual and material help from friendly countries. According to common sense: When a person has power and influence, it is easiest to win people's flattery and collusion; if he is in a poor situation, people will give him a cold shoulder and ignore him. The British and American loans were approved after the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan. Therefore, many people believe that this was unexpected. In fact, this is inevitable. We have the determination and ability to resist the war to the end, and it will surely make the help of friendly countries become more active.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact: When the demands of the fascist aggressors exceed the level that democratic countries can tolerate, democratic countries will definitely unite and become active.</p>
<p>A world war is not a matter of one, two, or three years, but may break out in one, two, or three months. We are not gloating and hoping for a world war to break out, but we are saying that we should seize the opportunity to stand firm in our own position, follow the teachings of the Premier and the guidelines of the War of Resistance and National Construction, clarify our diplomatic path, shatter the dreams of the German-Italian line, and join the peace front of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Give the aggressors a blow. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee: Heated Questioning Battle; Debate Focuses on the China Issue; The Military Clique Cabinet Becomes the Target of Criticism <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo dispatch, 1st × The questioning battle in the House of Representatives Budget Committee entered a state of close combat again. The main points of the debate focused on: (1) increasing the number of cabinet members from political parties; (2) whether there are differences between the policies of former Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, and current Foreign Minister Arita and Army Minister Itagaki; (3) whether to demand "reparations" from China; and (4) whether the interests of third countries in China should be respected.</p>
<p>Only Two Political Party Members</p>
<p>First, Seto, a member of the Seiyukai party, questioned that Prime Minister Hiranuma's previous speech stated that he respected the status of political parties. However, there are only two political party members in the current cabinet, which is not enough to show the current cabinet's respect for political parties. The number should be increased as soon as possible to achieve the practical effect of national unity. Hiranuma only replied that his cabinet was formed based on talent and did not ask whether they were members of a political party or not, but he would fully respect the status of political parties. It can be seen from this question and answer that the recent arrogance of political parties is slightly higher than before, and the politics of cooperation between military cliques and bureaucrats has obviously aroused dissatisfaction among the people. Therefore, it is worthy of attention that political parties seize the opportunity to make demands.</p>
<p>Putting on a Show, Empty Threats</p>
<p>Seto also asked whether it was true that the policies of the former and current foreign and army ministers were quite different. Hiranuma only replied from the side that there are no fixed and unchanging policies in the world. The implication is self-evident. Next, a certain member questioned whether third countries will be compensated for the damages suffered due to Japan's military operations in China. Arita replied that Japan may provide relief automatically, but has no intention of paying compensation. He strongly stated that a certain department of the cabinet recently advocated taking a more active attitude and declaring that a state of war already exists. Under military operations, the interests of third countries in China do not need to be considered. This is obviously a kind of intimidation to third countries. Those who heard it smiled it off.</p>
<p>Deceiving Oneself and Others, Demanding Reparations</p>
<p>Eto, a member of the Seiyu women's association, questioned why not demand "reparations" from China. Arita's reply was still self-deceiving. He also mentioned whether the four principles for resolving the war that he had proposed were still unchanged. Arita replied that Japan's fundamental policy towards China is fixed and unchanged. Although Konoe's December 22nd statement was different from previous statements, this was the result of environmental changes. However, Konoe's statement has not changed so far. This reply contains a lot of implications. Watanabe, a member of the Minseito party, questioned the security situation in North China. Itagaki replied that the military strength has recently been concentrated in (the occupied areas) to try to maintain the security of the area. One can imagine his embarrassing situation of being preoccupied with one thing and neglecting others.</p>
<p>Itagaki Reveals His Ambition Towards the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Foreign News, Army Minister Itagaki reported in the Diet Budget Committee today that since the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Soviet Union has been stepping up its military preparations in the Far East and actively increasing defenses on the border. Although there have been border crossings from time to time, this can only be regarded as accidental and has no international nature. There are no new incidents at present, but the Japanese side has made appropriate preparations to deal with incidents at any time.</p>
<p>Invasion War Against China Cannot be Stopped</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Foreign News, Japanese Army Minister Itagaki said in the Diet that Japan has no intention of resolving the China Incident by means other than military force. The Japanese army's actions in China will continue unabated. He admitted that order has not yet been restored in the Japanese occupied areas.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The Japanese Foreign Minister said in the House of Representatives budget committee that he was unaware of the report regarding the visit of the British representative to Japan, but "it is possible and normal to exchange opinions with important figures from around the world." Army Minister Itagaki denied the rumors that the Japanese side will adopt methods other than force to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying that if the Chiang Kai-shek government does not abandon its anti-Japanese and pro-communist policies, the Japanese military action will never stop. Many Minseito party members asked what the gains of the Konoe statement were. Arita replied that anyone with a little insight, whether Chinese or foreign, should know that China's resistance to Japan is a very foolish thing. Part of the gains of the Konoe statement have already been manifested, and the rest will be seen soon.</p>
<p>Yonai Boasts of Hegemony in East Asia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Foreign News, Foreign Minister Arita said in the Diet today that it is a mistake for the general public to think that the aid given by Britain and the United States to the National Government is an economic oppression of Japan. Japan has no intention of blocking China's doors. A certain member of the Minseito party asked whether the Japanese navy's fuel would be sufficient in the event of an emergency in the Pacific. Navy Minister Yonai replied that the Japanese navy is fully prepared to deal with any situation.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Roosevelt Consults with Military Commission on National Defense Plan; Pacific to be the Center of Defense; Germany Builds Fortifications in the Caroline Islands <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] The national defense plan discussed by the Military Commission and President Roosevelt intends to use most of the $500 million budget for the plan to expand defenses in the Pacific region. Military observers said that although defenses in the Atlantic and Caribbean seas are extremely important, the Pacific will still be the center of American defense. Experts believe that the army and navy are currently developing defenses in the Atlantic and Caribbean seas through the following actions: (1) strengthening mobile air force and building important air force bases; (2) increasing the number of aircraft fields and aircraft manufacturing plants; and (3) stepping up the activities of seaplanes in the Panama Canal. Admirals Leahy and Hebert said that the United States must be prepared to defend against attacks by powerful navies. Naval experts explained that strengthening the defenses of Guam can limit the activities of invading countries' fleets in the Atlantic or Pacific.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Assistant Secretary of the Army Colonel Johnson delivered a radio speech this evening, stating that a certain country at this time intends to control the world by force. The United States has no choice but to strengthen its military and prepare for self-defense. Some say that it is just a nightmare that one day the United States will be invaded, and it may not actually happen. However, what we thought were fantasies in the past have now become reality. How can we guarantee that what we think are fantasies today will not become reality? Our country is located on the shores of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with very long coastlines, and has territories. We must have a powerful navy that is no less inferior to any other country. According to the Monroe Doctrine, we also bear heavy responsibilities in the Western Hemisphere, and we also need a strong military force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The House Naval Affairs Committee met today to discuss the replenishment of US naval bases. Republican Senator Mayes immediately declared that, according to the information he obtained, Germany is building defenses on one of the Caroline Islands in the Pacific with the consent of Japan. The Caroline Islands are located south of British Guam and originally belonged to Germany. After the European War, they were assigned to Japanese rule.</p>
<h3 id="e25">American Policy Towards Europe: Britain Believes it Makes a Significant Contribution to the Balance of Power; France is Deeply Impressed, Germany Launches Fierce Attacks <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 1st] It is believed here that President Roosevelt's decision to provide war materials to Britain and France as much as possible is an important contribution to the redistribution of power in Europe. After the democratic countries of Britain and France obtain the assistance of the American arms industry, they can reduce the current superior military strength of Germany and Italy. British officials refused to comment on President Roosevelt's remarks before they were confirmed. The diplomatic community does not know whether Britain has signed a contract to purchase military fire from the United States, but it is believed that Britain and the United States have had detailed discussions on the issue of military fire. The British cabinet is currently discussing the issue of military fire and its relationship with the international situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The statement by President Roosevelt guaranteeing democratic countries is extremely impressive here. Although the statement does not interpret that the United States will send troops to Europe in the event of a conflict between totalitarian countries and the democratic countries of Britain and France, the strength of this statement has indeed exceeded the relationship between the United States and European democratic countries in the past.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] This evening, the newspapers in Berlin expressed their anger at President Roosevelt's report to the Senate Military Committee regarding the acceptance of military fire and the affairs of European democratic countries. The headlines of the newspapers included "American Defense on the Rhine" and "Roosevelt's Incredible Provocation." Political figures do not pay much attention to this report, saying that it is unofficial, and even saying that it is unconfirmed. However, German political figures believe that if the news of the secret meeting reported by American newspapers is true, then President Roosevelt's remarks are very strange, because they are tantamount to indicating that he will destroy Hitler's peace work and make Europe unable to obtain true peace. They told our reporter, "This kind of peace is necessary for American prosperity. We cannot help but think that the United States has made a mistake. This kind of war-like preparation is very noisy and nothing more than wanting to promote unfortunate events." The "Berlin Evening News" said that this kind of action is unprecedented since the Great War. "This proves that President Roosevelt is Wilson II and the United States has destroyed its neutral policy." The "Local Newspaper" said, "President Roosevelt has now shown his hope, that is, he wants to make Britain and France the pawns of Jewish American war policy."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] This morning, the newspaper groups here unanimously and fiercely attacked President Roosevelt, calling Roosevelt a "war instigator and the leader of communism." The People's Observer said that Roosevelt "actually wants to overthrow the world into chaos in order to fish for the benefit of the Jews."</p>
<p>Isolationists Protest</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Many US senators requested President Roosevelt to clearly express the US policy towards Britain and France to the country. The senator from California said, "The basic question is whether we will move towards war and the people will never know about it." Senator Clark of Missouri declared, "I will investigate the situation stated by President Roosevelt. The manufacture of American fighter jets will be affected because aircraft must be supplied to France. I request that all records of the Military Committee be made public." Democratic leaders unanimously questioned why selling aircraft to democratic countries would involve the United States in the war. Senator Johnson said, "This is a secret question. A small origin may produce terrible results. We really have the right to know the path we are taking now."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] A small group of senators opposing President Roosevelt's "aid to democratic countries" policy has now been formed and may be expanded. At the same time, the president's position in the constitution is also very stable, because the constitution stipulates that when the head of state exercises the power of foreign relations, the Senate's power of intervention is quite limited.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Members of the American Academy of Isolationist legislators protested today against President Roosevelt's secret convening of members of the Senate Military Committee yesterday, but other parties responded more favorably to the President's move. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said, "To disallow democratic countries to prepare for self-defense is tantamount to assisting countries that implement intimidation." Senator Johnson issued a statement that could represent the opinion of the isolationists. He said that the American people should have the right to understand whether selling aircraft to Britain and France will lead the United States into war, and said that the president secretly informs the committee of events that involve not only the Senate but also the people of the whole country without informing others, which is easy to cause misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the facts. At the moment, there is a lot of speculation that Roosevelt's hints imply that the law prohibiting the transport of military fire and aircraft to belligerent countries may be abolished when the legislative bill is revised in mid-May this year. One commentator said that when the next world war breaks out, the United States will become "the largest supply station in the world's history. American large-scale manufacturing plants will manufacture aircraft, heavy artillery, tanks, food, and clothing at a rate that no other country can match." The countries that will benefit the most from such an amendment to the Neutrality Act will be Britain and France, because the United States</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The New York World Telegram commented on the sale of aircraft to Britain and France, saying, "The significance of this matter is that Britain and France pay us in cash, and we strengthen our most important and most threatened national defense outposts. We are very fortunate to have this transaction. In terms of national defense, our supply of an aircraft to Britain and France today is more effective than supplying the US Air Force half a year later. The most advanced outpost of American peace and security is not the Atlantic Ocean, but Britain and France. This is a very obvious matter." Isolationist senators Clark and Knee demanded in the Senate today that the Military Committee publish the records of the review of French aircraft purchases. Knee said that if the committee has such secret meetings again in the future, he will implement a boycott, saying that these meetings are "completely incompatible with the steps that democratic countries should take."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] According to the statistics of the Department of Commerce, France will be the largest customer for ordering aircraft from the US this year. France has already ordered 100 "Curtiss" military aircraft from the US, and the French air corps is also consulting with the US authorities to continue ordering 600 aircraft, valued at $35 million. Last year, the three countries of the Netherlands, Japan, and China purchased the most aircraft parts and aviation supplies from the US, totaling $68 million.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, nearly half of the aircraft and aircraft materials manufactured in the United States in 1938 were exported abroad, with a total value of $68,000,000. Of these, 44 percent were transported to countries along the Pacific coast. By country, the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies were the largest customers, accounting for the first place, purchasing a total of $2,774,043. Japan ranked second, purchasing a total of $11,062,447. China ranked third, purchasing a total of $6,391,7213. The next ones are Argentina, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the British Hong Kong Island. As far as the orders that various American aircraft have received in the current year are concerned, the countries of Europe are the largest customers. In addition, according to the statistics of the Department of Commerce, the number of waste steel exports from the United States last year was 1,381,901 tons for Japan, 309,319 tons for the United Kingdom, and 230,903 tons for Germany. Among them, the number purchased by Japan, Italy, and Germany increased compared to 1937, while the United Kingdom decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Hoover Speech: Attacks Roosevelt's Policies; Believes There is a Danger of Causing War <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 2nd] Former President Hoover delivered a speech at the Municipal Council here last night, vehemently attacking President Roosevelt's foreign policy, saying that the President's policy has completely violated the Neutrality Act and there is a danger of causing war, because any country with a little strength will find it difficult to endure such oppression. Hoover warned the people of the country that anyone who thinks about economic sanctions should think about the danger of war. When referring to the danger of an invasion by totalitarian countries, Hoover dismissed it as absurd. He believes that neither Germany, Italy, Japan, nor the Soviet Union intends to interfere in the Western Hemisphere. President Roosevelt's policy has put the United States in a difficult position of having to specify who is the aggressor. This attitude of claiming the right of natural leadership is laughable. American policy has gradually moved towards active aggression, but if you want to be actively aggressive, you must first have the strength. Today, we seem to have the intention of breaking communist, Nazi, and fascist ideas, but ideas cannot be destroyed by battleships and aircraft. Hoover concluded that after the next world war, countries around the world may become dictatorships, and the United States will be difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] The 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, to be held on March 10 this year, will propose the abolition of the "Mass Purge Case." The initiator of this proposal is Zhdanov of the Soviet Central Executive Committee. It is reported that he will report to the Congress at that time that past "mass purges from time to time" have not had any effect. The purges often expelled loyal members of the party for the crime of being "passive," while reactionary elements were still able to hide and exist. This proposal will be submitted to the party congress on the 10th of March for discussion and approval, which can be regarded as a sign of the restoration of normalcy within the Soviet Union. The case includes allowing party members to publicly criticize the highest party and government authorities, the secret trial system will be completely abolished and replaced by individual trials, so that those accused of violating party discipline can defend themselves. It is said that the movement against capitalist elements will be stopped, and the distinction between workers, intellectuals, and farmers will be abolished.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Le Havre, France, 1st] Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing District of China, in the name of the commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, the chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, and the representative of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, expressed his gratitude for the relief efforts for Chinese refugees by the groups over the past two years. He went to Europe and visited Pope Pius XI in Rome, deeply obtaining the Pope's permission. At the same time, he was also encouraged by the French Idong Church Missionary Society. This afternoon, he took a mail ship to New York. He plans to stay in the United States for half a year on this trip, and then return to China. Before leaving, he also made the following remarks to a Havas News Agency reporter. The reporter asked, how long will the Sino-Japanese war last? Yu replied that, weighing Japan's strength, it may not be able to support the war for more than two years. If the country wants to control China, it must occupy all of China. It is absolutely impossible to seize only a few cities, because China is an agricultural country and its main lifeline is not in the cities. As far as the current situation is concerned, only the places where the Japanese army is stationed are occupied by it, and the rest are still in the hands of China. Asked how he thinks the Sino-Japanese war will end, he replied that Japan will never be able to end the war by force, and one day Japan will be the first to ask for peace. Asked if Europe were to have a war, would Japan come out to help Germany and Italy based on the Anti-Communist Pact, he replied that Japan cannot conquer China, how can it have the ability to participate in another war?</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] According to local officials, the United Kingdom does not wish to discuss the issue of re-distribution of colonies raised by Germany unless there is a unanimous and perfect solution from all parties concerned. In other words, if Germany intends to use the colonies as a base for aggression, so that German air force and submarines can use this to threaten the interests of the British Empire, it should be refused discussion. As long as this motivation of Germany exists, the United Kingdom will not be willing to give the colonies to Germany. Prime Minister Chamberlain will never be willing to return Tanganyika (originally belonged to Germany and is now a British mandated territory) in East Africa to Germany, because the traffic from the Cape of Good Hope, the Red Sea, to India is based here. If Germany occupies this place, the route to India is subject to attack at any time.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st] Gaida, a spokesperson for Mussolini, published an article in the "Strenth" of the German "Hitler Youth Corps" yesterday, explaining Italy's strategies in the Mediterranean. The article first emphasized that the Mediterranean is Italy's sea route and the oppressive policies adopted by France in the Mediterranean towards Germany and Italy, and then said, "France's imperialist ambitions are a crisis in Europe's future. As for Britain, it wants to encircle Italy and isolate Italy's supply. Italy has seen this and cannot but take counter-measures. The policy of the German-Italian axis is to enable Germany to develop towards Southeast Europe and to enable Italy to develop in the Mediterranean. Britain, France, and China have adopted oppressive policies towards Italy in the Mediterranean. During the Abyssinian War, Britain and France's policies reached a high degree, but the result of the war was not only that Italy increased its land, but also gained political victory in the Mediterranean. Under the rule of Chamberlain, Britain is adopting a policy of coordination on the one hand and expanding its military on the other. The scope of military expansion even includes the Mediterranean. After the Abyssinian War, Britain wanted to control the waterways of India, and there were two ways to pay attention to, (1) seeking waterways in Africa, and (2) concentrating its strength in the Mediterranean. According to the current situation, Britain is adopting the second way. Britain recognizes the Mediterranean as a base for observing the strength and actions of foreign countries and as a part of the island's colonial policy, so it has no choice but to maintain its colonies in Africa and not allow other countries to interfere. France's policy is also no different from Britain's. Today, Italy's policy is to resist the oppression of Britain and France."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 1st] Today, Ssorini, accompanied by German Advance Army Commander Lusian, reviewed the fascist army and the 20,000 people.

<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Authoritative sources reveal that British Prime Minister Chamberlain will formally preside over the opening of the Palestine Conference on Tuesday morning next week. He will deliver speeches to each delegation individually, and receive responses from the leaders of each delegation. It is generally expected that substantive talks will begin two or three days after next Tuesday. Colonial Secretary MacDonald and Under-Secretary Butler will attend the majority of the meetings. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will also attend several sessions. Colonial Secretary MacDonald met with several members of the Jewish Congress today, who will also participate in the Palestine Conference. These include Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Berligne, Professor Sirig, and Mr. Lurie. The first Jewish talks will be held on Wednesday, as they will not arrive from Palestine until Tuesday evening. MacDonald also met tonight with representatives from Egypt, Arab countries, and Iran. It is generally expected that speeches delivered at the conference will be in English, French, and Arabic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] During today's continued question time in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Adams first raised the question of the Colonial Office's refusal to allow 10,000 German Jewish children to enter Palestine. He suggested that restrictions on Jewish entry should be implemented gradually in the future. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied that this issue of immigration restrictions will be discussed in the upcoming London talks, but the outcome is difficult to predict. However, the government will prioritize humanitarian considerations and strive to allow these children to enter Palestine.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Eisk, 2nd] According to the Soviet TASS news agency, a new conflict has occurred on the Soviet-Manchukuo border. Five Soviet border guards near Krasdorfskaye were fired upon by 18 "Manchukuo" soldiers using machine guns and rifles. The "Manchukuo" soldiers were later repelled, and the Soviet commander sustained minor injuries. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo has received instructions from the government to protest to the Japanese government, stating that "Manchukuo" military incursions into Soviet territory are occurring frequently and warning that the Japanese side will be responsible for any serious consequences.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Brief Commentary: Gospel <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>In the past few days, newspapers have been rapidly publishing several articles that have attracted worldwide attention, namely the speeches of German Führer Hitler and British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and the remarks of US President Roosevelt. This newspaper's brief commentaries over the past two days have clearly pointed out Hitler's speech's madness and intimidation, and Chamberlain's speech's empty words to conceal the disaster of war. Now, Roosevelt's remarks have also caused a huge reaction, that is, the cheers of the people of Britain and France, and the anger of Hitler's pro-government newspapers.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, in a conversation with the Senate Military Affairs Committee on the 31st, stated that "in the event of any conflict in Europe, he will not hesitate to take any steps short of war to support democratic countries and confront dictatorships." This statement is noteworthy for at least three reasons: (1) It more clearly expresses that "peace is indivisible." If the United States wants to maintain democracy and peace, it must sanction fascist aggressors who are killing democracy and peace internationally. (2) It teaches and strengthens Britain and France, urging them to actively unite with the Soviet Union and the United States to resist fascist aggressors. (3) It also serves as a strong warning to fascist aggressors in the Far East, forcing them to consider the potential blow to their rear while invading the West and advancing South.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that Roosevelt's voice is a gospel for defending human freedom and world peace. It is entirely expected that this gospel will be cheered and supported by righteous and peace-loving people in Britain, France, and around the world, while arousing the resentment and anger of the aggressors Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is especially noteworthy that President Roosevelt has not only made remarks, but is also striving to repeal the "Neutrality Act," to strengthen the anti-war capabilities of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and to unite the Soviet Union in aiding Britain and France. The French "Aviation Delegation" is also being warmly welcomed by the United States. Although leaders of compromising diplomacy in Britain and France may feel uncomfortable with this policy, will the vast majority of righteous people in Britain and France ultimately break through this discomfort?</p>
<h3 id="e37">Hitler's Conspiracy Against Ukraine <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Translated by Bao Ren from the January issue of the New York magazine</p>
<p>If we look at a map of Eastern Europe, we can see that between Germany and the Soviet Union are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and many other smaller countries. These small countries, bordering the Black Sea to the east and the Baltic Sea to the north, form a "zone of small countries." Due to their vast resources and rich agricultural products, these areas have aroused the covetousness of fascist aggressors. Currently, due to Chamberlain and Daladier's policy of appeasement, which deliberately concedes to aggressors, Hitler has been emboldened and fearlessly carries out aggression. After annexing Austria, he proceeded to partition Czechoslovakia. However, Hitler's aggressive ambitions are far from being satisfied, and Czechoslovakia's sacrifice will not fill his aggressive desires. His next target is still to take a posture of preparing to attack the Soviet Union, following the "Eastern Invasion" route to recover Memel, return it to Germany, win over Hungary, and establish the so-called "Independent Ukrainian State."</p>
<p>Ukraine is a province in western Soviet Union with a population of 35 million. In addition, there are 5 million Ukrainians living in southern Poland, and the Ruthenia autonomous region at the eastern end of Czechoslovakia is also entirely populated by Ukrainians. In these three Ukrainian-populated areas, there are rich coal, iron, and oil mines, and fertile wheat fields. At the end of the eighteenth century, more than one million Germans migrated to the steppes of the Russian Ukrainian province. Therefore, German ambitious people have been coveting Ukraine for a long time. In 1918, when the European War was about to end, Germany forced Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, stipulating that Russia recognize Ukraine's independence, and also sent 400,000 German troops to garrison the area. Later, due to Germany's defeat, this dream became a fleeting shadow and disappeared. It was not until Hitler came to power and seized political power that he openly reiterated Germany's ambitions for Ukraine at the 1937 National Socialist Party Congress. Because Ukraine is vast and rich in resources, its land area is much larger than Germany itself. If Hitler can seize this piece of meat, the unemployment problem in Germany can be completely solved, and all unemployed workers and poor farmers' children without land can be transported there. At the same time, Ukraine is something Hitler is determined to obtain in the process of his conspiracy to attack the Soviet Union. We only need to pay close attention to the recent words and deeds of the leaders of the National Socialist Party to know that this assessment is correct.</p>
<p>Eastern European ethnic groups have always been very complex, and the residences of various ethnic groups and national boundaries have many complicated places. Therefore, the slogan of "national self-determination" is often used by aggressors as an excuse to change national borders. Hitler's swallowing of Austria and dismembering of Czechoslovakia used the slogan of "national self-determination" as a decorative term for aggression. Now that Ukrainians are living in Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia, Hitler can use this excuse to instigate Ukrainian independence. Recently, the National Socialist Party headquarters in Berlin has established a Ukrainian Bureau. Within the territory of Czechoslovakia under German hooves, the Ukrainian National Self-Government Association has been established, and the National Socialist Party's organ is published there to promote National Socialism. At the same time, the leader of the Belarusian Restoration Party, Silovitz, also personally went to Berlin to discuss the Ukrainian independence movement with Hitler. As for the base from which they began their activities, it is the Ruthenia autonomous region at the eastern end of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>The reason why Hitler extremely opposed Poland and Hungary's demands to divide the Ruthenia region and advocated the establishment of an autonomous region in Ruthenia is, on the one hand, to split the unity between Poland and Hungary, but on the other hand, it is also for the convenience of his own aggression. Now, Ruthenia is full of German National Socialist Party workers, and a large number of incited Ukrainians have been transplanted from Poland to Ruthenia to plan activities together with German agents. It is said that Germany will recently establish a special military agency in the area. Now that Hitler has de facto turned Czechoslovakia into a protectorate, it is naturally easy to establish a center for the Ukrainian independence movement in Czechoslovakia. But how can he force Poland to submit and order it to incorporate the Ukrainian-populated areas into the Independent Ukrainian State? Hitler often feels uneasy about this issue. It is said that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will hire Poland to lobby for this issue.</p>
<p>Since the Ruthenia region has become a base for German military and political activities, southern Poland has felt direct military threats. In addition, the National Socialist Party's seizure of power and demonstrations in Danzig have made the Polish authorities feel like they are sitting on pins and needles. At the same time, the National Socialist Party won a great victory in the Memel election. The chairman of the Memel Area Committee has been filled by National Socialist Party member Bertulon. This is an ominous sign of Germany's invasion of Lithuania. Moreover, Germany has now suppressed Hungary, and its economic and political forces have penetrated into the Balkan countries, invisibly isolating Poland and surrounding it with the Nazi Party. Poland sees through this weakness, so it has shaken hands with the Soviet Union and is working hard to conclude a commercial treaty with Lithuania. Because Germany has ambitions to invade its own territory, Lithuania is also happy to re-negotiate a friendship treaty with Poland to counter this common enemy. In addition, Poland is also working hard to connect with Britain, France, Romania and Yugoslavia, attempting to re-establish an anti-German fascist front.</p>
<p>As for how Hitler can make Russian Ukraine leave the Soviet Union! This is the theme of Hitler's entire plan, and it is also the place where he will run into a wall. Because the Ukrainian ethnic group in the Ukrainian region has enjoyed complete autonomy since the revolution, and has never been oppressed by foreign ethnic groups. Since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the industry in the Ukrainian region has increased fivefold. Among the entire Soviet Union, the Ukrainian people are the province that has benefited the most from economic construction after the revolution, so the people naturally warmly support the Soviet government and are not tempted or moved by external forces. In addition, the figures that Germany has always used as leaders of the Ukrainian independence movement, such as Silliwitz, are all representatives of the pre-revolutionary landlord class who abused the poor. Ukrainian farmers recall the slave life of the past, and they still feel pain. Today, they will definitely not follow their shells and be fooled by them. With the powerful national defense of the Soviet Union, Germany would never dare to gamble its country on one throw. Therefore, Hitler's only method now is to first use diplomacy, economy and military force to annex, oppress or intimidate small countries in Eastern Europe, especially Hungary, Romania, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Lithuania (Czechoslovakia is no longer a problem), to open a path directly to Ukraine, and then use diplomacy or military force to occupy Ukraine.</p>
<p>Germany's support for the Ukrainian independence movement is exactly the same as Japan's establishment of the Manchukuo independence movement in China. The future of Eastern Europe will become a place where fascist demons dance. If the small countries do not wake up and unite as soon as possible, they will inevitably be overthrown by the black wave of the fascist frenzy on the European continent, and there will never be a day of peace. But the Soviet Union is a fortress of world peace; she not only holds the determination to save humanity and defend world peace, but also holds the power to destroy all foreign aggression. If the small countries of Eastern Europe can cooperate with the Soviet Union, and the anti-fascist front can succeed quickly, then a strong wall across the European continent will rise from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, serving as a fortress to resist Hitler's eastward invasion, and this fortress can become the tomb of German fascism.</p>

<p>Due to the atrocities of warplanes in Guangxi Province, the number of refugees is increasing daily. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are actively raising funds for relief. The Women's Welfare Association previously donated 5,000 yuan in national currency. Following that, the local textile merchant guild donated over 460 yuan in national currency. Yesterday, Hong Kong gentleman Ho Kam-tong donated 2,000 yuan in national currency to the Bank of Guangxi in his personal name. In addition, many people have made small donations to the Bank of Guangxi. Manager Zhang Zhaotang is remitting these funds to Guangxi Province free of charge. Those wishing to donate can directly contact the Bank of Guangxi.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association received HK$206.48 donated by Mr. Huang Kaiji. Peninsula Hotel employees donated salaries. The Aid Association donated 355 cotton vests. The savings box of the Minsheng Cloth Factory contained $4.40, 70 cents in small change, and three silver coins. The students of the private Guangzhou University donated HK$622.35 from the proceeds of a fundraising carnival. Wang Yuquan donated 500 bottles of emergency relief pills.</p>
<p>Improving the Financial Management of the Three Hospitals</p>
<p>The Colonial Secretary's response to the question from Unofficial Member Brooke was as follows: Increasing the financial subsidies for the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals has been under consideration for some time. In early 1936, the directors of the Tung Wah Hospital petitioned the government for a subsidy of 150,000 yuan to cover the deficit in 1937. After discussion, the government has agreed to several steps to improve the financial management of the hospital, specifically agreeing to the following: (A) The Board of Directors should prepare and adhere to an appropriate annual budget and should submit annual financial records audited by an auditor approved by the government. (B) The annual budget should first be approved by the existing permanent advisory committee. (C) The medical and charitable work of each hospital should be handled separately. Separate budgets should be prepared for each department, and the location of the two departments should, to the extent possible, be separated from the Tung Wah Hospital's long-standing and reputable charitable work, such as providing relief to the elderly, weak, poor, and destitute, and providing coffins for burials. (D) All matters related to the medical administration of each hospital will be managed by a medical committee appointed by the Governor. The committee has already been appointed, and the list of members was officially announced on December 16, 1938. The members include the Director of Medical and Health Services or a subordinate official (Chairman), two consultants from the Tung Wah Hospital, three directors, a medical inspector from the Chinese Hospital Medical Bureau, and the attending physicians of Tung Wah Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, and Kwong Wah Hospital. (E) Traditional Chinese medicine will still be retained for hospitalized patients to choose from. (F) In the future, the funds of the Tung Wah Hospital will be kept in cash and not used as mortgages or property.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Annual Accounts as Satisfactory</p>
<p>The review of the annual accounts of each hospital was implemented in 1937, and the government found the results satisfactory. The accounting was good. The accountant responsible for the review only suggested a few minor improvements. The proposal to allocate an additional 150,000 yuan to cover the deficit in the hospital's 1937 expenses will be submitted to the Finance Committee meeting to be held after the end of this meeting. The reasons for the deficit are as follows: (A) Increased costs for medical improvements. (B) Increased number of patients, partly due to the current war. (C) Reduced property income. (D) The impact of war relief issues on donations from all sectors to the hospitals. The government firmly believes that the valuable work of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals in benefiting the Chinese people of Hong Kong in the past will not only continue but will also continue to increase its value. The existing cooperation between the directors of the three hospitals and the government will surely be further improved, without affecting the organization of most privately funded charitable organizations. Steps have already been taken to establish guarantees for sound administration. It is hoped that these guarantees will be sufficient to encourage enthusiastic people to continue to donate generously to this great charitable organization to provide financial assistance.</p>
<p>Explaining the Purpose of the Draft Ordinance in Detail</p>
<p>When Attorney General Ansell requested the passage of the draft ordinances, he also explained them, stating that the purpose of this draft ordinance is to close the Governor's Office and Urban Development Fund. From the perspective of the circumstances when the fund was established, this point is greatly related to the public interest, and the Governor has also instructed this seat to provide a detailed explanation of this draft ordinance. The fund was prepared to pay for the construction costs of the great urban development plan (including the sites of the old Governor's Office, the Secretary of State's Office, and the old City Hall, etc.). Part of the City Hall site was sold to the HSBC, and the sale price has been allocated to the fund. At that time, it was also decided that in the future, after other sections of the site were sold, the sale price would be allocated to the fund. At that time, it was hoped that the sale price could offset the construction costs of the Governor's Office, the joint government office building, and the new City Hall. Later, for various reasons, the plan could not be implemented. When Sir Hutt-Jedd was Governor, he expressed his opposition to the entire plan, expressing dissatisfaction with the expansion plan of the Governor's Office and its surrounding sites, believing that there was no need to rebuild the Governor's Office. Therefore, the plan was temporarily shelved.</p>
<p>The Remaining Construction Funds Are Allocated to the Public Treasury</p>
<p>After the Governor took office, he reconsidered the issue. After discussing it with the unofficial members of this council, he issued a memorandum stating that he believed it was appropriate to build a new Governor's Office, but agreed with Sir Hutt-Jedd's objection to the development of the Governor's Office and its surrounding sites. At the same time, he indicated his approval of building a new City Hall with part of it used as government offices. The memorandum pointed out that the 839,000 yuan in the fund could not cover the full construction costs. At the same time, it explained that the remaining part of the sale price of the City Hall site could still be allocated to the fund. However, it was no longer possible to rely solely on the sale price to pay for the construction costs. Therefore, it was recommended that the Governor pay for the reconstruction costs and the development costs of the designated site from public funds, and the remaining funds in the fund would be allocated to the public treasury. The decision to carry out this plan can be seen in Section 11 of the Financial Secretary's memorandum on the financial situation of 1939. The Financial Secretary also mentioned the current draft ordinance at the budget meeting of this council. It is only a legal procedure, requesting this council to pass it. In fact, the established plan has already been canceled, so the fund should also be closed. At the same time, I want to report to everyone that the government is determined to build a new City Hall within an appropriate period. However, because the site has not yet been found, it must be delayed slightly. But consideration of the site issue has already begun. Once a decision is made, construction can begin.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee Passes Supplementary Government Expenses</p>
<p>A finance meeting was held after the meeting, chaired by Colonial Secretary Smith. A request was made to approve supplementary government expenses totaling 1,698,673 yuan, including (1) a total of 1,261,126 yuan in supplementary expenditure budget for the previous session. This supplementary amount is the deficit amount for each expenditure item from item 307 to item 330 of the previous session's expenditure budget. Among them, the actual expenditure that exceeded the budgeted amount the most was item 324, item 28, with a deficit of 312,642 yuan. The second largest was item 319, item 22, the expenditure budget of the Department of Health, with a deficit of 100,500 yuan. (2) The supplementary budget amount for this session reached a total of 437,4147 yuan. Passed.</p>

<p>Since the illegal blockade of my coastal coastline in Fujian, unauthorized burning of Hong Kong-registered fishing vessels has been carried out near Hong Kong waters, and fishermen operating at sea have often not been spared. This tragedy has been going on for two years, with thousands of fishing vessels burned and more than 10,000 fishermen killed, resulting in property losses of tens of millions, unprecedented in history. This has led Hong Kong fishermen to warn each other not to go to sea. No fewer than tens of thousands of people are scattered in Cheung Chau, Junk Bay, and Aberdeen, all unemployed and without food or clothing. The situation is extremely miserable. Mr. Xu Shiying already has a complete plan to provide relief to fishermen. He also believes that the destroyed fishing vessels are registered with the Hong Kong government and should not be arbitrarily ravaged and destroyed by the enemy. Therefore, he specifically ordered the Fishermen's Association here to prepare a written report detailing the circumstances of the fishermen's disasters and the damages they have suffered, and submit them separately to the China Relief Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, so that the two agencies can forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, directly requesting the British government to provide effective protection for Hong Kong fishermen to operate at sea, in order to maintain the livelihood of fishermen. The Fishermen's Association is now under orders to draft the petition and will send it to the China Relief Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission during the day.</p>

<p>Following recommendations from the Air Defense Department, local education authorities are currently considering the issue of evacuating school children in wartime. The Director of Education recently convened a meeting of teachers from all schools in Hong Kong to discuss air defense and delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of learning about air defense. He instructed all teachers to pay attention to air defense in schools and the evacuation of students. It is understood that each school has received instructions to prepare a wartime school evacuation plan. It is believed that the main point of the evacuation plan is that all schools in Hong Kong will temporarily suspend classes during an emergency, and students will return home. Schools with dormitories must establish air-raid shelters for students who cannot evacuate to their hometowns to ensure their safety during air raids.</p>

<p>The number of marriages registered at the Hong Kong Marriage Registry last month increased significantly, totaling as many as 46 cases, of which only four involved foreigners. On the 24th of last month alone, Deputy Marriage Registrar Mr. Carter officiated eight marriages. On the 18th, there were also seven marriages, five of which were officiated by Mr. Carter. This is likely because the lunar calendar considered that month to be particularly auspicious. This month may also be a similar "marriage" month, as there were three marriages registered at the aforementioned registry the day before yesterday and six yesterday.</p>

The historical materials and scenery depicted are completely different. The film includes valuable historical material from the 19th century, such as the opening of the World's Fair, the Crimean War, the charge of the Light Brigade from "The Charge of the Light Brigade," coronation celebrations, and the British Prime Minister's acquisition of the Suez Canal rights. The entire film was shot in real locations within the deep palace halls of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle in London. The magnificent splendor is like visiting the palace in person, making it endlessly fascinating. At the 9 p.m. show tonight, the Queen's Theatre has hired the Soviet Royal Army Military Band to perform on stage to add to the splendor.

<h3 id="e49">Imperial Aviation Aircraft "Geolier" Attacked: Captain Details Incident: Location West of Weizhou Island, 350 Miles from Hong Kong, Japanese Warship Fired Five Shots but Fortunately No Hits <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Hanoi route aircraft "Geolier" was attacked by a Japanese warship on the morning of the 31st of last month when it flew out of Hong Kong at 7 a.m. over Weizhou Island. Captain Wilson, who piloted the "Danapoora" back to Hong Kong at 3 p.m. yesterday, described the incident.</p>
<p>Details of the Incident</p>
<p>On Monday, the "Geolier" and "Danapoora" departed Hong Kong one after the other, with the "Geolier" departing thirty minutes earlier. The flight altitude at the time was 1,000 feet. After passing the location where fishing boats had been burned, they discovered a warship south of Weizhou Island. Two minutes later, another warship was seen docked west of the island. This warship appeared to be a transport ship. While I was intently looking down, a fire suddenly erupted to my left. I realized that the warship was firing at the "Geolier." One or two minutes later, the co-pilot, Mr. Shen Wei, saw the warship continue to fire. The first shot flew high over the aircraft, and I saw it splash into the sea. The four shots after that all fell into the sea, missing the aircraft. Only one shot was at the same altitude as the aircraft and exploded with a loud noise, but the aircraft was not damaged.</p>
<p>Confirmed as a Japanese Warship</p>
<p>The vessel firing the shots was a transport ship. The other warship did not take any action. The nationality of the ship could not be determined. However, the incident occurred to the left of Tu Chau, and Weizhou Island was already in the hands of the Japanese, so the ship firing the shots was undoubtedly a Japanese warship. After the aircraft was attacked, I sent a telegram to the "Danapoora" to inform them of the situation and advised them to change their flight path and avoid passing Weizhou Island. Therefore, they fortunately arrived safely.</p>
<p>Temporary Change of Route</p>
<p>The Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Hanoi route usually flies from Norway Island to Chikam, and must fly over Weizhou Island. The route has long been established and has been in operation for many days. Since the "Geolier" was attacked, when the "Danapoora" returned to Hong Kong from Hanoi, it avoided flying over Weizhou Island and flew 40 miles south of the island to avoid another attack. In the future, the Hong Kong-Hanoi route may be temporarily changed. Yesterday, the aircraft carried 1,447 pounds of mail when it returned to Hong Kong. There were no passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The Confluence of Refugees: A Trip to Shenzhen <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Lo Ha</p>
<p>Shenzhen, once known as the "Monte Carlo" of the East, and the Yau Sang Company, a large gambling den, and the battlefield of countless battles, has now become a confluence for refugees. The Relief Group of the United Relief Committee for South China Refugees has been working diligently here for two months. To inspect the situation and take a look at the desolate remnants of its plunder, the reporter went there for a comprehensive tour.</p>
<p>In the morning, I took the 10 o'clock train to Lo Wu, accompanied by more than twenty colleagues, two female members of the Chinese Youth Ambulance Corps, and the talkative and cheerful Lam Pui-sang, a representative of the Relief Group of the Refugee Relief Committee. There was no need to worry about being lonely! The laughter of "giggling and quacking" filled the carriage. Before long, the train had arrived at Lo Wu. After getting off the train and passing the high stacks of sandbags and the iron-net fences, we saw the national flag of the Republic of China flying high on an iron pole. Combined with the bright sunshine, blue clouds, green trees, and open fields, everything was filled with joy and smiles. Yes, the motherland and its rivers and mountains are lovely! They are worthy of being cherished! From the railway tracks, we could already see the shadow of the Yau Sang Company. Green tiles and red walls stood beside the railway tracks, and the surrounding small rivers were like a colorful jade belt tying this majestic palace.</p>
<p>Although the interior of the Yau Sang Company is covered with spiderwebs, collapsed, and dilapidated, it still wears a beautiful coat and retains a history that makes people sigh!</p>
<p>Clean Refugee Rooms</p>
<p>Walking past the right side of the Yau Sang Company, the bamboo fence marks the location of the refugee shelter. Inside, there are five shelters, accommodating more than 3,000 refugees. The auditorium of the Shenzhen Theatre has been converted into the first shelter. Inside, wooden boards are used to build two-story "bunk beds." Each bed is for two people. The auditorium is very spacious, and the light is quite sufficient. The new "bunk" beds are covered with brand new straw mats, giving people a sense of cleanliness and joy. Although flies are flying outside, they are not seen much inside the shelter. This is a very good phenomenon. The person in charge quietly told the reporter that the former Hong Kong Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health inspected the shelter and did not cover his nose with a handkerchief. Compared with the New Territories, this is indeed a significant improvement.</p>
<p>My Clothes are Extremely Dirty</p>
<p>You can't see flies in the refugee sleeping rooms. As soon as you run out of the refugee room, these dirty bombers—flies—chase the refugees, with a somewhat persistent demeanor. The reporter became curious. Could the flies be afraid of the smell of the new straw mats in the room? Oh dear, a smell of moldy vegetables, like poison gas, pierced people's hearts and lungs, almost suffocating them! A refugee saw this situation and said with a bitter smile, "Sir, my clothes are extremely dirty. I haven't changed them since I fled here." The reporter calmed down and asked him, "Then, what about bathing?" He said without hesitation, "I'm too lazy to bother since I don't have clothes to change, and water is often scarce. It's almost a problem to even drink."</p>
<p>The reporter looked at his yellowed teeth and dark yellow face, which was a little scary. "Water is indeed a problem!" The reporter thought as he ran, but later he saw some female refugees washing their hair in many places. After running to other places for a detailed inspection, he realized that the water shortage was not as severe as that refugee said. However, it is true that there is a serious shortage of clothing. It is said that because there are few clothes and many people, every time clothes are distributed, it is like hungry people抢饭. Once there's a commotion, they are all gone. It is likely that some refugees are too lazy to bathe because they cannot get clothes. Therefore, we sincerely hope that enthusiastic people will donate more old clothes. At the same time, we also hope that the responsible personnel inside will take strong measures. No matter what, the refugees must bathe every few days so that the refugees' hygiene and cleanliness can be improved.</p>
<p>I Haven't Tasted Pork</p>
<p>After looking at the five refugee rooms, we turned to the dining hall. The square dining hall is covered with sunflower bamboo. Inside, there are piles of red bricks. "What? Breaking stones?" a colleague couldn't help but ask with a smile. "Breaking what stones? Those are dining tables, and those are seats," the person in charge said while gesturing. It turned out that the stone tables and benches, combined with the surrounding green trees, made this dining hall quite interesting. The refugees came to this place in queues when it was time to eat, which seemed to be in order. However, most of them were still complaining, "I haven't tasted pork. Every meal is just vegetables and soybeans!" It is said that a meat dish will be added starting from the 15th, so the refugees will no longer have to sigh about not having meat.</p>
<p>Refugees are generally uneducated, so we naturally hope that those in charge will increase the amount of meat provided to them as much as possible. The most important thing is to find a way to make them understand their situation so that they will not be so greedy.</p>
<p>I Haven't Been Avoiding Certain Foods</p>
<p>The medical care is provided by people from the Chinese Medical Association who take turns serving the refugees. There is also a ward for hospitalized patients. This ward is located on the floor above the consultation room. The hospitalized patients sleep on new canvas beds, covered with new cotton quilts. The air is not bad, and there is a thermos bottle on each person's bedside. Everything is very thoughtful, and they are quite comfortable. The maternity ward is also under construction. The medical facilities in the future will naturally be very complete. However, what is still lacking at present is the "avoidance of certain foods" for patients. Several refugees made this request to the reporter.</p>
<p>How to Train Refugee Children</p>
<p>In an open space, a group of refugee children, both boys and girls, are performing calisthenics. They are wearing messy and tattered clothes, and some girls are still wearing braids. While shouting slogans, they are moving. What a meaningful and interesting picture this is! It is said that initially, their parents were unwilling to let their children come out for training. Fortunately, the person in charge came up with a way, telling them that biscuits would be given to the children. As a result, all the children in the shelter came, and they took the opportunity to keep their children and start training them. Now, there have been very significant results. There is also a refugee school that is about to open. The education of refugee children has also been resolved.</p>
<p>Refugee Skills Registration</p>
<p>In the refugee shelter, many people have specialized skills. The shelter is now actively registering and starting to use them, such as doing woodwork for sheds and masonry work. Most of the talents needed in the shelter are selected from the refugees. Various jobs such as pig farming and vegetable cultivation are also being prepared to fully utilize the refugees' production capacity. Regarding cultural nourishment, a small library has already been established, and it will continue to be expanded in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel that it is very commendable that this refugee shelter has achieved so much in such a short period. However, we still earnestly hope that the above-mentioned shortcomings can be actively improved.</p>

<h3 id="e54">News from Nanchang <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>

<p>—Japanese and Chinese Wounded Soldiers and Others—</p>
<p>(1) A Glimpse of the Second First Aid Station</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the evening, I stayed at the Second First Aid Station in Nanchang, where the staff were very busy. There were eight hundred wounded soldiers, making this one of the best first aid stations in Nanchang. Nanchang has a total of nine first aid stations. The wounded soldiers were lying in rows in huge rooms, this first aid station originally being a school. The beds they lay on were Chinese beds—that is, a large wooden board supported by two wooden benches. A straw mat was placed on the bed, covered with a woven mat. The military medical department issued each wounded soldier with a cotton quilt, but three hundred were donated by the citizens of Nanchang. Upstairs and downstairs, there were male and female singing groups singing to entertain the wounded soldiers. The group closest to us consisted of two women and an old man. The old man played the huqin (Chinese violin), and the women sang songs, one of whom was blind. They mostly sang folk songs. They sang as they walked, interspersed with many patriotic songs. The wounded soldiers here were all from the De'an front line and were also elite soldiers of the Guangdong army.</p>
<p>(2) Hardworking Staff</p>
<p>This first aid station provides care for an average of 3,600 people per month. The general manager is an old military doctor. He is helpful and enthusiastic, which he takes pride in. He said that if a large group of new wounded soldiers arrived, the staff would work all night. The staff there includes a station master and a deputy station master, four doctors, twenty nurses, and ten attendants, specializing in applying medicine. The staff in the station donate part of their monthly salary to help with the extra meals for seriously wounded soldiers. The government's expenses are enormous. Patriotic people are also willing to 'sacrifice their hunger for the public good.'</p>
<p>The secretary of the Jiangxi Anti-Japanese War Service Federation works in this reporting conference. This federation was organized in August 1937 and is directly under the provincial party headquarters. Recently, it has expanded its organization to include many mass organizations, such as the Mobilization Committee, the Women's Life Promotion Association, the Women's Voice Society, and the wartime Jiangxi Youth League. This reorganized federation has a drug relief team with four hundred staff members who bravely work deep in the trenches of the front line. It also has a "Fundraising Committee" and two propaganda departments, which go deep into the masses to conduct propaganda among children, youth, women, merchants, workers, and farmers.</p>
<p>The work of the "Fundraising Committee" is very significant. The government ordered it to raise 100,000 sets of cotton clothes and 120,000 cotton vests. They have already raised 80,000 cotton vests and 16,000 sets of cotton clothes, all voluntarily donated by the people. However, they were not raised solely from Nanchang; they were raised from all over Jiangxi Province. They hope to complete their mission in two weeks.</p>
<p>Route from Hong Kong to Yunnan via Haiphong</p>
<p>1.  For Meixian, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, etc., Meixian can be the center. There are highways from Jiaoping to Meixian. Then, from Meixian to Songkou (there are highways and waterways), take an electric boat from Songkou down the Tingjiang River directly to Chao'an, then transfer to the Chaoshan Railway to Shantou. In Shantou, wait for a boat to Hong Kong. From Meixian, take a car to Songkou, costing 2.4 yuan in Guangdong currency (taking a private boat costs about 8 jiao; electric boats are only available in the spring). From Songkou to Chao'an costs 1.68 yuan in Guangdong currency. From Chao'an to Shantou, the third-class fare is 7 jiao in national currency, the second-class fare is 1.1 yuan, and the first-class fare is unknown. To Xingning, Wuhua, Longchuan, Zijin, etc., you can take routes through Fengshun, Jieyang, and Puning to Shantou. To northern Guangdong, you can take routes through Qujiang and Hengyang, or through Lianping, Longchuan, Wuhua, and various highways to Shantou. As for Shantou to Hong Kong, there are regular foreign ships and irregular ships sailing, which take 16 hours to reach. The fares often vary depending on the situation and cannot be fixed. Half a year ago, the first-class fare was about 35 yuan in national currency, and the third-class fare was 6 yuan. Renting a canvas bed from a fellow passenger costs about 1 to 3 yuan in national currency. From Hong Kong to Haiphong in Annam, there are French postal ships and Taikoo ships to Sichuan and Yunnan, etc., and Guangdong and Duobao, etc., departing every five days. The French postal ships take about 40 hours, and the Taikoo ships take about four to five days. In addition, there are Jardine Matheson's Wo Sang and Ming Sang, etc. The schedules of various shipping companies can be found in the shipping schedule section of this newspaper. The fares are listed below:</p>
<p>Second Class Third Class Fourth Class</p>
<p>French Postal Ship 54.0 30.0 20.0 All in Vietnamese currency</p>
<p>Taikoo Ship 34.0 25.0 11.0 All in Hong Kong currency</p>
<p>(Each Vietnamese yuan is currently equivalent to 1.7 yuan in national currency or 9 jiao in Hong Kong currency)</p>
<p>Haiphong hotels include Natural, Paris, New Asia, and New China, which serve Cantonese, Shanghai, and English speakers. Room rates are approximately 1 Vietnamese yuan per day.</p>
<p>From Haiphong to Kunming, take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which takes four days and three nights in an ordinary passenger car. The fare and schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>On the first day, Haiphong to Hanoi takes 3 hours. Hanoi hotels include Tongli Natural, with double rooms costing 3 Vietnamese yuan and single rooms costing 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Japanese Wounded Soldiers Who Hate War</p>
<p>In a hospital, the Red Cross medical team cares for ten Japanese wounded soldiers. The doctor working there can speak Japanese because he studied medicine in Japan. The Japanese wounded soldiers told him many unpleasant things. They frankly said: "I really don't know what the war is for?" Although I came here to participate in the war, I don't know what it is for. Many factories in Japan have closed their doors, and only the military factories are working day and night. The lives of our women and children are very difficult!" It is truly a long silence of sighs!</p>
<p>One Japanese wounded soldier captured spoke about his father's story. He said that his elderly father was a soldier in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 and often told him about the horrors of war. The prisoner said: "When I put on my uniform and said goodbye to my father, he cried loudly. We are so poor, and now prices in Japan are constantly soaring, making it impossible to live!" He almost broke down in tears as he recounted this.</p>
<p>Another Japanese wounded soldier captured was born in Guangdong and speaks fluent Cantonese. When the prelude to the war began, he was recalled to the country to join the army and fight in China. During the Battle of De'an, he was captured due to injury. During the fierce battle, he heard Chinese soldiers speaking Cantonese. He was afraid of dying in battle and hated the Japanese militarists' invasion of China even more, so he walked into the ranks of the Chinese army, explained the situation in Cantonese, and asked them not to kill him. This is a story told by the Guangdong army returning from the front line.</p>
<p>(4) The Chinese Spirit of Resistance Active Everywhere</p>
<p>A dozen of us traveled together to the front line by car. Several Chinese people traveling with us could represent the Chinese people. One was a university professor from Shandong Province and his wife from Beiping. Two were students from Shanghai, one from a scholarly family. One was a farm girl from Wuhu. One was a middle-aged farmer... the organizer of the peasant guerrillas, and one was a small worker from Guangzhou; he is now our driver, bravely driving at full speed, rushing to the front line. One was a senior political worker in the Guangdong army.</p>
<p>After nightfall, just after a torrential rain, our car drove off the road and almost into the river. Fortunately, an electric pole stopped us, preventing a "submersion" disaster. In the rain and darkness, we worked together. We used weeds and stones to support one rear wheel, while the driver lay under the muddy car to lift the car that had gone off course with a car jack. Our farmer immediately thought of a shovel, so he borrowed one from a nearby house and diligently dug a small ditch behind the undamaged wheel. However, the road was mostly gravel. We took turns digging, with the Chinese civilian and the professor guiding us on how to dig more easily. The two students failed, and my main job, in addition to digging the mud on the road surface, was to patrol back and forth, because I was afraid that once the electric pole broke, our car would easily fall into the river!</p>
<p>We spent a total of three hours on the "car rescue" work. Digging this small ditch was very difficult. After digging, the undamaged wheel drove down, causing the other dangerous wheel to rise, and we were no longer as afraid of falling into the river after the electric pole broke. We also built a small levee on the side of the dangerous wheel; when our car returned to the road, we couldn't help but cheer loudly.</p>
<p>The Guangxi political worker loudly said that we must fill the small ditch we dug in the road with dirt, because the following vehicles would think that the traitors had buried landmines, etc. So we used the shovel, two boards, and our hands to fill the dirt back to its original state. The descendant of the scholarly family was covered in mud, the professor's hands were also stained with dirt, and our shoes and clothes were splashed with mud and water. Other male and female companions were also like this. So we wiped our hands on the wet grass, cheered loudly, and embarked on the journey again, looking forward to the front line. This spirit—the spirit of unity and perseverance—is the sugar spirit of the Chinese resistance! (Special)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Travel Notes from Hunan and Guangxi (Continued) <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>—Shuai Yucang</p>
<p>In the minds of most people in the past, Guangxi was a border region, with barren land, a tough population, and a backward culture. However, when we arrived in Quan County, what we saw was the opposite. Life here is simple and unpretentious, which is sufficient. I remember Mr. Lei Binnan published an article in the Guangxi Daily called "A Glimpse of the Study of Local Culture in Guangxi," which quoted a passage from the Guangxi General Records: "In Guangxi, marriage does not emphasize wealth, and betel nuts, pork, and wine are distributed to relatives. When guests arrive, after tea, betel nuts are offered. Prayers are made for illness, and funerals favor Buddhism. Burials may involve stacking stones to surround the tomb. There is no fixed offering for sacrifices. Cleanliness is not as good as in the Central Plains. Generally, customs emphasize simplicity. Clothing does not favor fine silk; wealthy families only wear it during auspicious ceremonies, and villagers may not see it once in their lives. Eating is only for sustenance, and banquets only have chicken and ordinary dishes. Houses are made of brick and wood, or bamboo is used for beams, pillars, and tiles, but they are not strong. Other than that, there are thatched roofs and earthen walls, and ancient customs still remain. Scholars only value copying books, and farmers do not know how to store them. Craftsmen only learn rough skills, and merchants only trade within a hundred miles, without venturing far to seek profit." The Guangxi General Records were compiled in the sixteenth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty, more than two hundred years ago. During my month-long stay in Quan County, I felt that the people's thriftiness was not much different from what was described in the passage above.</p>
<p>Quan County is the entrance to the northern border of Guangxi, and the population is currently increasing rapidly. Housing is also in short supply, just like in Banlin. As a result, housing prices are rising daily. Currently, houses in the Qingxiang Town area of the city cost about three to five yuan per room (national currency), and the rising prices of other daily necessities go without saying.</p>
<p>Regarding education in Guangxi, it is currently flourishing. Because many cultural institutions from lost territories have moved to Guangxi, many universities and schools have come. The original basic schools in various towns and villages are already numerous. In Quan County, there is one provincial middle school and one church-run middle school. Recently, the Wuhan County Joint Middle School has also moved here, which is truly good news for Guangxi's culture.</p>
<p>4.  Transportation in Guangxi</p>
<p>The transportation network of Guangxi Province is something that we should understand during our travels. The following is a summary for reference:</p>
<p>(A) Those who come from Hunan via Quan County, Xing'an, and Fanchuan to Guilin can disperse to various counties along the highway. (1) From Guilin along the Li River, you can reach Yangshuo, Pingle, Zhaoping, and other counties. (2) Along the Guili Highway, you can reach Yangshuo and Lipu. (3) From Lipu, travel northeast along the Liba Road to reach Pingle, Gongcheng, Zhongshan, Mao County, and other counties. (4) From Lipu, travel west along the Lilu Road through Xiuren, Liujiang, and Rong to reach Liuzhou. (5) From Liuzhou, travel north along the Liuzhang Road through Liucheng to reach Chang'an Town in Rong County. (6) From Liuzhou, travel south along the Liuhe River to reach Wuzhou. Along the river are Xiang County, Wuxuan, Guiping, Pingnan, Teng County, and other counties. (7) From Liuzhou, travel west along the Guizhou-Guizhou Highway to reach Yishan, Hechi, Nandan, and other counties. (8) From Liuzhou, travel southwest along the Liubin Road to reach Qianjiang and Binyang. (9) From Binyang, travel southeast to reach Guixian, Yongchun, Hengxian. (10) From Binyang, travel southwest along the Yongbin Road to Nanning. Then, travel southwest along the Yonglong Road through Mingjiang and Ningming to reach Longzhou. (11) From Nanning, travel northwest along the Yongse Road through Wuming, Guode, and Tiandong to reach Baise.</p>
<p>(B) Those who travel from Guangdong to Wuzhou can disperse via waterways, taking boats to Pingnan, Teng County, Guiping, Guixian, Hengxian, Yongfu, Yongning, and then heading northwest to Baise, or south to Longzhou. From Guiping, heading north, you can reach Ruizhou.</p>
<p>(Note 1) "Lanner" refers to an introducer.</p>
<p>(Note 2) "Hand-tossing the sky" refers to ten days.</p>

<p>Question: I am very grateful for your answer to "From North Borneo to Singapore"! I still have some questions that are not clear, which are listed in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. So-and-so has lived in Sandakan for more than two years. When he recently returned to China, he had a "Registration Certificate for Overseas Chinese and a Passport from the Chinese Consulate in Sandakan" and a "Guarantee from the Sandakan Chinese Affairs Department." If he now intends to go directly from "Hong Kong" or "Shantou" to Singapore, does he still need to obtain a passport to go abroad?</p>
<p>(2) British ships cost 20 pounds, and German ships cost 11 pounds. What is the equivalent in national currency? How much are the miscellaneous expenses?</p>
<p>(3) Does Shantou have a transportation travel agency that can handle this?</p>
<p>(4) If a passport to go abroad is required, is a store guarantor still required if there is a passport from the consulate?</p>
<p>(5) If you take a cabin to Singapore, are you subject to Singapore's restrictions on Chinese immigrants? Can you disembark freely?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) You have a Registration Certificate for Overseas Chinese and a passport from the Chinese Consulate in Sandakan. It is not clear what type of passport this refers to. We cannot answer unless you provide further details. However, if you have a residence permit issued by the Sandakan government, you still need to obtain a passport to go abroad in Shantou or Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(2) Each British pound is equivalent to more than 30 yuan in national currency, or about 16.1 yuan in Hong Kong currency.</p>
<p>(3) It is not clear whether Shantou has a transportation travel agency.</p>
<p>(4) It is best to submit the so-called consulate passport to the Hong Kong China Travel Service for verification.</p>
<p>(5) For new passengers from Hong Kong to Singapore, each class is limited to 25 people. New passengers are encouraged to take second-class seats.</p>

<h3 id="e62">South China Players Start Joint Training to Prepare for Summer Tour of Australia. South China Already Toured Australia Seventeen Years Ago <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special Dispatch) It has been seventeen years since the South China Athletic Association football team first toured Australia.</p>
<p>That tour of Australia by South China can be said to be a great achievement in sports diplomacy, and it was also a forward path for South China's football development.</p>
<p>I remember it was the summer of 1923. The South China team, led by Mr. Eng Moh, braved the winds and waves, setting off for Australia. Li Huitang, whose golden age was just beginning, was also among the expedition members.</p>
<p>Embarking on the journey, they engaged in more than twenty matches, learning from the strengths of others and compensating for their own weaknesses, eventually achieving satisfactory results and returning triumphantly.</p>
<p>After returning, they continued to participate in the 1923-24 First Division League. In every competition, they fully utilized the experience and skills gained during their tour of Australia, making each friendly team fearful and unmatched, and finally winning the championship for the first time.</p>
<p>Recently, South China has planned a second tour of Australia and has already made contact regarding the prospects, which are promising and hopefully will come to fruition.</p>
<p>This expedition is planned on a large scale, intending to first compete in areas of Southeast Asia such as Malaya and Java, before moving to Australia. Although the tour of Australia may be subject to future changes, even if it becomes just talk, the tours of Malaya and Java are already decided and will definitely happen.</p>
<p>Therefore, Director Mok, planning for any eventuality, gathered a group of players the day before yesterday to hold a symposium to discuss the expedition plan, and decided that from the date of the meeting, everyone would begin joint training to prepare for the upcoming expedition.</p>

(7) Ye Bichen proposed setting a date for the fourth plenary meeting of the council. It was decided to hold it at 7:00 PM on February 8th.</p>
<p>Improve the Incentive System</p>
<p>Deng Jixi, chairman of the Hong Kong Training Committee, proposed that the overall championship should be abolished in Hong Kong inter-school track and field and group competition should be advocated. The original text is as follows: (Hui You) In the past, sports meets have set up overall championships to reward and urge sports teams as an encouragement. However, the gains and losses, honor and disgrace, of the overall championship only belong to one team. The encouragement and urging effect mostly affects the organizers and less affects the general youth. As a result, it only enhances the glory of the organizing body, and the athletes are merely its tools. Today, the promotion of physical education should encourage the general lower-level youth, not just the urging personnel at the upper level. Therefore, the past system has suffered from many problems, and various means are used to attract athletes in order to gain social vanity. In reality, only a few athletes with some skills can enjoy the benefits of sports. The vast majority of weak students are ignored. The overall championship has not been seen to have a good effect on the universalization of sports. Therefore, it is hoped that the inter-school track and field meet organized by the Federation will be replaced by group competition. As for the system that can directly encourage the athletes themselves, it should be preserved as much as possible. Group competition encourages all teams to universalize sports and abolishes the past wrong plan of cultivating only a part of the athletes. Therefore, this proposal is made. (Method) Each school participates with a unit of thirty people, divided into group 6000-meter relay championship, group long jump championship, group shot put championship, with scores based on total points as the principle, not aiming at outstanding performance. The groups are divided into male A, B, C, D, and female A, B. Rewards are divided into trophies for each group of men and women.</p>
<p>Plan for Holding a Symposium</p>
<p>The passed plan for holding a symposium on sports issues is divided into five items: (1) Purpose: To rationalize the provision of sports facilities, broadly solicit sports theories, and jointly promote the Federation's affairs. (2) Scope of the symposium: Topic: How to realize the rationalization of school sports facilities. Content: (A) Current status of school sports facilities in Hong Kong. (B) How to improve and develop school sports in Hong Kong. (C) Exploration of the Federation's theory of popularizing sports. (D) Exploration of the Federation's proposed medal system theory. (E) Theoretical exploration of the Federation's organized friendship sports meet. (3) Nomination letters from the academic community: (A) Sports community. (B) Sports community. (C) Medicine and health. (D) Educational scholars. (4) Date: To be held after the Federation's inauguration ceremony. (5) Chairmanship and preparation: To be chaired by the Mountain Design Committee, with Standing Committee members appointed to prepare.</p>

<p>(Our Newspaper Special Dispatch) This weekend, South China and Eastern will have a special Silver Shield rematch. The previous match between the two teams ended in a draw, with no winner determined, hence this rematch. South China is preparing to meet the challenge and attaches great importance to the lineup. It is rumored that Zhang Manrong may not be used in the left wing position to replace the suspended Li Shuoyou, or Lu Dakeng may be assigned to the position. Although Dakeng's skills are quite good, he is inferior to Manrong in many aspects. It is actually better to use Manrong, but because of his foot injury before, he has been resting for a long time, and it is unknown how he will perform on the field again. Central midfielder Lin Depu has recovered from his foot injury and should be able to participate in this match, otherwise, You Juxing should be used instead, which is better than Yang Genbao. The reporter specially proposed the following lineup. I wonder if the officials of the South China Football Department will agree to adopt it?</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong Zhang Manrong</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan</p>
<p>Liu Mao Liu Weipei</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong Lin Deti You Juxing</p>
<p>Zhang Manrong Liu Songsheng Chen Dehui Li Enke Yang Shuiqian</p>
<h3 id="e73">Overexertion and its Prevention <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>If we want to achieve the greatest effect from sports, we must apply both lightness and heaviness, qi and force. Qi refers to "endurance" (Starrfna). The methods of training "qi" and training "force" are different.</p>
<p>In other words, on the one hand, we must make the muscles grow in size and develop the muscles. On the other hand, we must promote the body's metabolism. The body's metabolism is directly proportional to the muscle contraction. The greater the muscle consumption, the greater the improvement in its effectiveness, and it can also normalize and activate blood circulation. To develop muscles, you must do exercises that require "force," that is, heavy exercises with fewer repetitions or shorter duration. To promote the body's metabolism and normalize and activate blood circulation, you must do exercises that require "qi," that is, light exercises with more repetitions or longer duration. The former is heavy exercise, and although the latter is very easy, it can also be very strenuous if the duration is too long.</p>
<p>Overexertion can make the body's metabolism too active, which prevents the body from reacting normally, and blood circulation is also hindered. This is not only useless to the body but also harmful. From this, we can know that if we do exercises to develop muscles and train "force," that is, strenuous exercises, on the one hand, we must also use light exercises to promote the body's metabolism and normalize and activate the functions of various organs and train endurance. Otherwise, it can cause the harm of overexertion.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are two other reasons for overexertion: (1) errors in the exercise itself, (2) insufficient nutrition and rest.</p>
<p>Regarding errors in the exercise itself, in addition to the lightness, heaviness, and amount of exercise, failure to develop all parts of the body evenly is also a reason. (Above)</p>

<p>Entertainment......Rural Scenery</p>
<p>South Riding</p>
<p>British films have made great progress in recent years. "Golden Drum Thunder" and this film, which were released in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, are good examples. "Rural Scenery" is originally a famous literary work. The author, Wfnfred Hoitby, is a writer who is extremely concerned about social and political issues. What is depicted in the film reflects a standard British village, where there are stubborn landlords who are gradually declining and villagers who are struggling with poverty and disease, as well as a large number of children who have no opportunity to be educated, living in dirty and unsanitary places. The film also depicts a group of people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings, trying hard to transform this village, while exposing the self-serving and selfish hypocrisy of those who only say nice things but cannot take responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p>The main actors, such as Anna Jingsi and Rolf Lee Quexin, also give excellent and refined performances. The other actors also have their own achievements.</p>
<p>Queen's Peace. Sixty Years of Zhou Yingying Palace</p>
<p>Sixty Glorious Years</p>
<p>This film is also about the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many important achievements during her 60-year reign. In order to be solemn and true, it was specially produced by the British Royal Company, but it also has a bit of propaganda about the history of the British Queen.</p>
<p>Because the material is particularly real, and those materials must not be removed or deleted, then in this situation, the director is not easy to please and handle properly. This film has made this mistake. The whole play, except for the first half, which writes about the Queen's life after marriage, is slightly vivid and lively. In the second half, it is just like a historical fragment, as an institutional introduction. This cannot be blamed on the director's ability.</p>
<p>There are several very superior aspects to the whole film, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the rush of the British Royal Army, the Queen's Jubilee commemoration, and later visiting her old palace maid. These are all worth mentioning. In terms of actors, there are no major changes from the previous film "The Great History of the British Queen." Anna Weiger, who plays the Queen, gives an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Wahlberg, who plays Prince Albert, is also quite excellent.</p>
<p>Eastern...Three Friends After the War</p>
<p>Three Comrades</p>
<p>It is also the third immortal masterpiece by German Remarque after "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Return to the West." The background of the film is the same as the previous two films in Germany after the war.</p>
<p>The whole film is handled with such agility and dynamism under the lively means of director Bao Caiqi. At the same time, there are also some interesting and wonderful descriptions. The personality of the three strong men is particularly successfully captured and is extremely strong.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Robert Taylor, Flange Tong, and Roger Tayang are all very hardworking and are indeed successful works. Of course, we still remember the achievements of the heroine Maglanta Sullivan in "Old Grudges and New Sorrows" with John Bosis. She also has a great harvest here.</p>
<p>Dahua...Wise Judge</p>
<p>Judge Hardy's Children</p>
<p>The pattern of the story is no different from "Beauty is Easy to Grow Old". It writes that Hatai received a call from the government to return to Beijing to preside over matters. As a result, the family moved from the countryside to Washington. Unfortunately, Hatai was deceived by a friend, and his daughter Manli almost fell into vanity and was deceived by others. The son, Andre, also made a very humorous romance. Finally, he returned to his hometown, living an old life.</p>
<p>Director George Hess handled this ordinary educational story and had very delicate methods, drawing the personality of each character on the screen very vividly, and some of the passages and dialogues in it made the audience feel particularly tasteful. In terms of actors, the most successful is Miguel Lonnie, and Shirley Parker is also very cute. The other supporting roles are all well-done.</p>
<p>New World...Women's World</p>
<p>Cantonese Movie</p>
<p>The plot depicts the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. The apartment contains all kinds of characters. They each have their own profession, but it is extremely complicated. Among them, there are female students, female reporters, female salespeople, singers, female dancers, etc. Almost all the employed women in the city are included here. The women are quarrelsome, and they each have their own experiences. It is not impossible to say that it is a collection of women in the city. However, the progress of the drama's storyline is very loose and forced because there is no man to entrust, which does not arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only describe the general private lives of ordinary women, such as disputes and quarrels, but the description of women in a wide range has never been written, which is the only reason for the film's failure. In the end, because the apartment was bombed, all the women realized it and united to go to the front line, which also seemed unnatural and formulaic. However, having said that, we must also forgive the writers and directors, as it is a very difficult thing to perform a play with all women.</p>
<p>Central...Bird Clothes Team</p>
<p>Cantonese Movie</p>
<p>Also known as the Romantic Maid, it is a fun story from a tyrannical family in a warlord era in Guangdong, describing a rich master who, in addition to having three wives and four concubines, also actively pursues servants, resulting in many romantic affairs. The author's original intention is, on the one hand, to describe the ugly history of the old big family, and on the other hand, to try to help the servants in the old family with their suffering. I believe that this kind of thing was often discovered in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Therefore, this play can be said to be a practical description. The writers and directors are very diligent from beginning to end, and the performance results are also good.</p>

<p>— Yun Fu</p>
<p>Japanese culture is in prison.</p>
<p>The fascist warlords have long since used the iron rod until it's worn out: several years ago, Kobayashi Takiji and many others were beaten to death in the sinister hell. After August 13th, Nakano Shigeji, who was as famous as Kobayashi, female writer Chujo Yuriko, as well as the aged literary authority Akita Ujaku, Eguchi Kan, and others have all been imprisoned one after another. The warlords are very cautiously preserving culture with iron chains.</p>
<p>The pathetic Tokunaga Sunao, however, uses alcohol to numb his nerves, fortunately avoiding imprisonment; but he deeply feels the pain of being mute. Tonamura Shiro and Kurahara Korehito temporarily stopped their translation work, waiting quietly for the volcano to erupt.</p>
<p>In addition, the military aggressively spurs on a group of shameless things. Speculator Hayashi Fusao and Sato Haruo appear to be active. The talks at the "Literary Discussion Group" are very earnest, but cannot hide the cowering trembling of the patriots (?). What are they doing? Although Kikuchi Kan's "Bungei Shunju" has removed the traces of "triangles and squares," he continues to engage in the work of "temporary excitement," and the effect of the old literature is exactly the same as before: the government also organized a "Pen Warriors Group" hosted by Kume Masao, joyfully coming to China, and some "warriors" were so frightened by the sound of cannons that they ran away.</p>
<p>Naturally, seven years ago, they also participated in the procession of welcoming the loyal remains of deceased soldiers back to court: wearing command swords, shouting orders, holding boxes wrapped in yellow silk, the faces of those triumphant warriors on the Shanghai battlefield were undoubtedly heroic, so they sighed and sang alongside them, moved to tears by the rhythm of "Kimitoyo,"... In the meantime, they cleverly neutralized the people's genuine tears of bitterness, singing praises of "death's victory" with an arrogant posture; but the literature is still a duck egg.</p>
<p>This time, the situation has changed, although it is still a duck egg: Ishikawa Tatsuzo vaguely sheds tears of despair for a group of "undead soldiers": their own ashes are not heard of returning to court, how long will the war be prolonged? Thus, "Undead Soldiers" eventually caused a storm in their own country. Then came punishment; finally: redeem oneself through meritorious service! The warlords know that "culture is in prison" and there is no one outside.</p>
<p>The "Pen Warriors" will understand under their feet that they are accustomed to relying on the old experience of "Kimitoyo" to boast in their own country's newspapers, deceiving the masses who lack tears. Ishikawa Tatsuzo ended up adding a tail to his own body, playing too narrowly.</p>
<p>It is also not surprising that the "Pen Warriors" are not competent, unable to sing praises in an extravagant and vigorous manner, still containing the tone of sobbing; because the subject matter is like this, it cannot be reversed. The literature here is outside the "Pen Warriors Group":</p>
<p>Same script, same race, originally friends like brothers;</p>
<p>The evil demon warlords, creating bottomless, deep hatred.</p>
<p>Rushing, slaughtering, millions of people turned to ash,</p>
<p>How can punishment not descend upon the devil's hand?</p>
<p>The blue sky and white sun shine upon the earth, the peaceful blue clouds of the world, when will they unfold?</p>
<p>Millions of blind eyes open in the artillery fire.</p>
<p>Beloved wife - we want to intertwine and be intimate, but this life is difficult to repeat.</p>
<p>(See Quanzhou 20th telegram)</p>
<p>The author of this song's air defense telegram is very clear about the fear of Yamada Saburo: ashes cannot be brought back is inevitable: the unbroken lineage of all ages will collapse with its clay feet.</p>
<p>From then on, singing praises of "loyal remains returning to court" has become a historical relic, and the tail of the "Pen Warriors" will sooner or later become a beautiful pattern on a fossil.</p>
<p>Yamada Saburo will be sentenced to capital punishment and will have to go to prison again, practicing his "difficult to repeat this life," but this is really a pity, their group should walk the road to hell. Is being a great singer of justice the most glorious? What flies outside the prison is freedom, the blue sky, white sun.</p>
<p>Naturally, the pain of "difficult to repeat this life" cannot be relieved without this; the comforting of the conscripted monks among the "Undead Soldiers" is futile, and transcendence is also a duck egg. One hand holding Buddhist beads, the other holding a steel shovel will surely let one's own soul hold one's own ashes, as "loyal remains returning to court." However, where to "return" to? Mount Fuji is about to erupt! It is too far from "achieving Buddhahood." Therefore, I slightly altered Jigong's nirvana poem and shouted it out:</p>
<p>"For a year and a half, it has been a mess, hitting the east wall to the west wall: from now on, pack up and go, never seeing the water connect to the blue sky?"</p>

<p>The Hong Kong wind is really good, but how about Shanghai, which is relatively prosperous? Shanghai, ah, my friend, have you ever missed it?</p>
<p>Life in Hong Kong is strangely comfortable: living in this "safe haven" where you can't hear the sound of cannons, Shanghai, ah, my friend, have you ever missed it?</p>
<p>The former "Paris of the East" has now become a desolate and terrifying isolated island, Shanghai, ah! My friend, have you ever missed it?</p>
<p>Your former second home has now become the nests of × people, ronin, and traitors, Shanghai, ah! My friend, have you ever missed it?</p>
<p>We cannot give up an inch of our land, we vow to restore the integrity of our land, Shanghai, ah, my friend, have you ever missed it?</p>
<h3 id="e78">Fishing Lights <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Lusheng</p>
<p>When the setting sun kisses the boundless sea waves, the western sky reflects a brilliant sunset glow, crows hurriedly sweep across this twilight sea and sky, and groups of fishing boats return from the sea, connected to each other. Amidst the sound of oars and sails, the night air gradually pervades the entire earth, filling the entire sea and sky, and all the scenery becomes indistinguishable from blurry, marking the beginning of night.</p>
<p>Countless fishing boats anchored in every harbor of the East Bo Liao Strait have a flickering mast light hanging on each boat's mast. High and low, thousands of lights, like cold fireflies, rest on this dark sea surface, twinkling with the stars in the vast sea and sky.</p>
<p>Following the flow of the night wind in the strait, the sea occasionally brings a burst of undulating, weeping and pleading "saltwater song," making people fully aware of the fishermen's historical and current suffering, and offering them infinite sympathy.</p>
<p>Since the bloody smell of war blew into the South China Sea, in order to protect the most beautiful gem on her crown, how many demonstration-like military exercises have been held. The tranquil night is often shaken by the sound of cannons and the roar of airplanes, and silvery-white "giant flames" dart back and forth across the dark space, searching for its target. The barking of dogs on the shore and on the water further deepens the horror of the night!</p>
<p>Near the sandy shore, three or two fishing boats are lying horizontally, repairing and scrubbing their bottoms, preparing to go out to sea. Several sparks from the fires used to bake the bottom of the boats burn around them. From the reflection of the firelight, you can clearly see that each boat's stern is pasted with some red, gold-edged paper strips, on which are written auspicious words commonly used on the water, such as "Smooth Sailing and Profit" or "Floating Residence Auspicious." A dim kerosene lamp hangs on the deck, and one or two earthen cannons are quietly placed beside the cabin, ready to retaliate against any attacker. Although its ancient and majestic appearance has lost its effectiveness in modern times, it still cannot but command solemn respect.</p>
<p>×××××××××, ××××××××, although it is the arrival of the "peak month," most fishing boats, in helplessness, can only cruise within the pitifully small Hong Kong territorial waters, engaging in minimal fishing. Very few fishing boats actually go out to sea. Even those who venture out find it difficult to guarantee a "smooth sailing and profitable" return—nine times out of ten they encounter × people and end up with the boat wrecked and the people dead. Therefore, most fishing boats have stopped going out to sea and are hiding in the harbor, spending their days in sorrow. The scattered fishing lights are precisely the places where many fishermen are heartbroken, shedding tears, enduring hunger, and suffering.</p>
<p>In the gloomy and silent sea, there occasionally comes a sound of a fishing boat raising its sails and turning its cable shaft. A huge fishing boat breaks the silence of the night and moves slowly. A person you cannot see stands on the quarterdeck, holding burning incense candles and paper ingots, shaking them up and down, worshiping the sky—they are helpless, they cannot get any help from anyone, they are desperately seeking the blessing of vague divine power. Finally, after much pleading, the burning incense candles and paper ingots are thrown into the sea and extinguished. The boat then follows, heading towards the dark and boundless sea, until the light on its mast is swallowed by the dark sea air.</p>
<p>The fishing lights anchored in Tung寮湾 are still shining, the desolate and mournful fishing songs are still floating, life, debt, death, arson, these contradictory thoughts are holding onto the hearts of every simple and honest fisherman...</p>
<p>The fishing lights illuminate the turbulent sea around the boat, and also illuminate their trickling tears.</p>
<h3 id="e79">"Steak" <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Po</p>
<p>Originally, the term "steak" was already well-known to the general public, especially among the Westernized people in this society. "Steak" is just a very common food—a piece of tenderloin that has been loosened with the back of a knife, pan-fried, and mixed with things like onions, green beans, and potatoes, and then seasoned with a little orange juice and mustard—usually available in every Western restaurant (big cuisine room).</p>
<p>However, what I'm talking about here is a different kind of "steak" with a different flavor. Although it also contains "meat," this is "human" "meat" and not "cow" "meat," and this kind of "meat sale" is only available in the "human meat market."</p>
<p>This "steak" is a "new seasonal dish with the characteristics of the night city" here.</p>
<p>It is the "spiritual" "cheap sale," the "meat" "bargain," and also mixed with "blood" and "tears" "free gifts"!</p>
<p>Whenever the lights are lit, and the movie theaters are over, on the vast streets illuminated by streetlights, in medium-sized bars and Western restaurants, there are usually some women who are strangely dressed and heavily made up, dressed seven parts like not humans and three parts like not ghosts, wandering, lingering, appearing and disappearing...</p>
<p>On each person's bloodless and seemingly emotionless face, a thick layer of white powder is applied. Each withered lip is heavily dyed with lipstick. Although a little smile sometimes floats between the eyebrows and eyes, it is so numb, so unnatural, that one feels at first glance that it is just decoration, just hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Although this smile is false and hypocritical, it is a kind of seductive tool, a medium for the "sale of flesh." Whenever a passerby passes by them, they usually skillfully throw over an eye wave, an eye wave with that pretended and hypocritical smile.</p>
<p>However, when they see at a glance that those passing by are not "foreigners" in "military" attire and "cheerful voices," they may immediately lower their faces. This may not be because their dog eyes look down on people, but because they intuitively realize that those who come are not the patrons they hoped for. They all feel that giving you this "glance" of "goodwill" is a waste, is in vain.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when those "foreigners" like "dumb cows" really come, after that moment of "glancing," there is further solicitation. Some who are quick-witted, with a few "words," also have "things going as desired." Then, a small hand "scoops over" from under the waist, and a thick arm "hooks over" from the shoulder, and the "buyer" and the "seller" "hook and scoop" like this to complete their final transaction.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Review of Literary Front, Volume 2, Issue 7 <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Hui</p>
<p>Volume 2, Issue 7 of Literary Front is presented to us in a very substantial manner. What is most worth pointing out there is Ding Ling's "Night in Ji Village." She writes about the mistakes made by a guerrilla team (which has not yet grown strongly into a model combat team) in violating the principles of the anti-Japanese united front. They did not use political work to correct and win over the irregular scattered troops, but gave them an inappropriate measure, as the author's note says: "Guerrilla warfare is good, but inevitably there are occasional bad places, so it exposes those 'bad places,' but this objective reality is expressed through the author's subjective grasp. What we should emphasize is the educational nature of this work; literary workers should make greater efforts in this direction. Xiao Manruo's 'Sacrifice Spirit' attempts to use satire to portray a new bureaucrat in the war of resistance—Chief Zeng ×. This kind of 'new wartime bureaucrat, new warmonger making national crisis money' (Mao Dun) is as harmful as a traitor and should have his 'portrait' drawn. The theme of Xiao Manruo's creation lies in this place. The protagonist in the work—Chief Zeng ×—he both works at the front line and is extremely afraid of death, hiding whenever he hears the sound of airplanes; but he is willing to have 'eternal war' so that he can 'work forever' and earn 168,000 yuan in twenty years. We feel that this character has too much contradiction, making people feel unrealistic and failing to achieve the success of 'typical creation.'"</p>
<p>Mao Dun's short essay "Overcoming Formalism" is actually an in-depth and simple "theory of the typical," which is also the most accurate creative guidance. He indicates "the order of a work from conception to maturity to final production." When the character is in the process of conception, "of course A is no longer the original simple A, and B is no longer the original simple B, but A has B in it, and B also has A in it, becoming another C that is neither A nor B but similar to A and B." This is the "conception" of the "typical." "We try to consciously analyze the character of this C, and try to analyze the meaning of those events from the actions within it (that is, the things that have happened centered on people like A and B). The result is the discovery of A and B," "we plan to write something with AB as the topic." Here, our creative sequence is first "synthesis," then "analysis," and then a new "synthesis."——Let's not mistake it; A or B are to be the "material" of the work, not the "theme" of the work, so it is ultimately after new "synthesis." He continues, "First determine A or B (this may be obtained by reading social science papers, or critical papers) and then go find 'characters' and find 'events,' the result is that you can also write a work, but there is often a danger of formalism." This short essay provides the basic rules for writers' creation.</p>
<p>Du Ai's "On the New Situation and the Strengthening of Writers' Life Practice" is a relatively large and solid paper. However, the author only generally discusses the new political situation, but does not discuss it in the specific category of the 'new form of labor' on the literary front. Literary theorists should pay attention to and deeply and broadly discuss this essential issue. I think it would be more concrete and essential to clearly stipulate the topic as how the literary front can cooperate with the new stage.</p>
<p>Turning to the short collection of random notes and reports, three of them are about the fall of Guangzhou before and after. Although they appear rough in art, the main purpose is to expose (simply and quickly), and the secondary purpose is the artistic technique. This can show "deep mountains and vast swamps" and "everything is strange"; therefore, abandoning "typical" and taking "type" is necessary in the task and needs of the war of resistance literature.</p>
<p>Ai Qing's "To the Painters" expresses the author's heartbroken dissatisfaction with the backwardness of "modeling art" (except for emerging woodcuts). He points out that "traditional Chinese painting has consistently betrayed the welfare of the people, serving the entertainment of the powerful in everything and striving for the satisfaction of individual self-deception." He calls on painters to "fight with the old traditions, fight with the philistine artistic tendencies, and dedicate themselves to serving the broad masses of people and serving the fighting will of awakened humanity." The author's painful whipping of the lagging modeling art workers is also the greatest need at this time, and the literary world's support and help for the painting world should be further expanded.</p>
<p>Ren Jun's short play "Before Departure" has somewhat contrived plots, but in the new wilderness, it is like sweet rain in the desert.</p>
