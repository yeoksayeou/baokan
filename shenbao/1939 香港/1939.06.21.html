<p>現在、是二十世紀的大時代、是舊的社會制度發展到最高頂點，而開始更急遽的崩潰的時代，也正是新的理想的社會由誕生而壯大起來的時代，這是黎明快要到來而黑暗逞其最後之餘威的時代，這是非常　亂非常艱苦，非常偉大的時代。</p>
<p>我們靑年大衆，不先不後，正生長在這個時代，我們固然不免為空前的黑暗與苦難而悲歌，我們更應為空前偉大的戰鬥的場面而慶幸，現代靑年的生活是怎樣可歌可泣；現代靑年的生活更應該怎樣的為除舊　新為創造光榮的歷史而奮鬥呢；『任重而道遠』，我們生長在這個時代的靑年，誰也不應該妄自菲薄啊；</p>
<p>『現代青年』今天在本報創刊，沒有任佝夸大的使命，也沒有任何高深的理想，我們期望着這個『現代靑年』，成為現代靑年最忠實最良好的伴侶；成為現代靑年學習工作與休息的會所，成為現代靑年為自己而發言與活動的場地，我們要在這裏紀錄下偉大時代的靑年們的奮鬥的痕跡，我們也要在這裏討論古今中外靑年生活與奮鬥的經騐和敎訓。</p>
<p>我們的期望雖然不大，但是如果沒有靑年先進社會領袖的提携和廣大靑年的互助是不能實現的！當此發刊　始，我們敢謹致無限熱烈與虔敬的祈望，給我們指敎，給我們批評，給我們稿件！讓所們不要辜負道二十世紀的大時代，讓我們從容地愉快地携手前進，向那嶄新的理想的時代前進！</p>

<h3 id="c2">擴大婦女義務教育 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 阿瑛</p>
<p>××建國工作的完成與否，佔着人口半數的廣大婦女的動員，是有决定作用的。因此，自抗戰以來如何動員潛伏着的廣大婦女羣衆，早已被視為一個很嚴重而急需解决的問題了，至於解决這一問題的中心關鍵，那麽就要立卽加緊對這些廣大的婦女羣衆，給以起碼的敎育，普及的敎育。</p>
<p>今年「三八一國際婦女節紀念會中，本港婦女界的先進們，也曾開始覺得敎育工作的重要，確定了將大會售紀念所得的義欵千餘元，作為擴大婦女義務敎育工作的經費，三個月來，當時的决議，進行了多少呢？婦聯是被自動解散了，當最後一次會議時，决定是把這工作，全盤交女靑年會負責的。僅僅這一點，可以說是付訐得當了吧？</p>
<p>本港女靑年會已被公認為全港最有基礎，有歷史的婦女團體，對婦女敎育工作，也早就比別人首先注意，而且也眞的出過不少氣力，有了相當的經驗和成績。</p>
<p>歡迎批評！　歡迎投稿！</p>
<p>現在，全港九六十萬未受敎育的女工和貧苦的家庭婦女，還是那麽樣的以最大的熱情，希望女靑年會能够早日根據婦聯的决議，馬上提出計劃、切實執行起來。</p>
<p>第一，我們　為女靑年會應該把這一工作，看作一件偉大的社會事業；應該號召更廣大的熱心羣衆及幹部來參加，應該動員各個社團及各校女同學們來共同負責。我們主張女靑年會應該於最短期內，召開擴大婦女義務敎育的會議；這個會議應該有各社團熱心於婦女敎育工作的份子，及對婦女敎育有經　的婦女幹部參加；卑能更發揮羣策　力，加速度把這工作眞正普遍深入的實施起來。</p>
<p>第二，根據我們听知道的。有許多工廠的女工友，巳寫信到婦聯要求替她們辦夜學了；這些女工大都是曾　參加過「三八』紀念大會的份子，她們是非常滿意婦聯關於擴大婦女義務敎育的决議，及渴望這個决議的早日實現。因此，我們認為女靑年會現在立刻就要首先接納這些女工友的要求，最低限度也要馬上在各個丁　區，辦起幾間夜義學來。</p>
<p>第三，我們認為我們不應該把這一工作，只限於辦辦夜學而已，應該盡量擴大其工作範圍到讚報，識字，救亡歌咏戲劇，以至於創立圖書館，及研究婦女運動問題……等等活動。只有這樣才能更廣大地把工作開展起來，同時應該有這樣的决心與計劃——擴大募捐，擴大組織，把工作長期繼續下去。</p>
<p>關於敎師的問題，我們認為應有週到的選擇與訓練；應該號召各學校各社團的熱心幹部給與一般對抗戰建國國策的基本認識、和發揮她們最大的服務精神，做到不拿薪資；使我們能以最少的物質條績，創造出最大的工作成件來。</p>
<p>姊妹們！不要再躊躇延遲了，要記着『××建國工作的完成與否，佔著全國人口半數的廣大的婦女力量的動員是有决定作用的』呀！</p>

<h3 id="c4">食物漫談 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 新球</p>
<p>人體的構造和作甩，很像一架精緻而複雜的機器，人類要進食物，眞如機器要加煤一樣。不過我們所進的食料，有的增進熱量，有的補償體質，更有些儲藏備用，那是非常複雜的。動物一般的特性往往由遺傳所規定，但是它所進的食物也有重大的關係。假使一個人通常只能長到五尺八吋的身高，任何特製的食物，也决不能使他超過此數，反之要是食物營養不足，這個人便不能達到五尺八吋的身材了。</p>
<p>平均每人終身約進五十噸左右的食物。而進七十磅食物，才能長成身體上的一磅肉，我們每天約吸入三千卡路利的熱，健康的人，把這些「熱能」的三〇至四〇％改變為「動能』。人類進用食物，除把它變倣能量之外或者　藏起來；更有些因為消化吸收不完善，反而拋棄到體外去。所以對於食物一方面當然重視它的營養價値，同時消化吸收是否能充分進行，更是一件重要的事。</p>
<p>人類必需的食物原料，通常可以分做蛋白質，脂，炭水化合物和礦物質四大類。炭水化合物往成為粉和糖，主要的功用是產生能量，在代謝作用中，他和脂多少是能够發生交互作用的。健康者全部食物的能重大槪四〇至五〇％得自炭水化合物，三〇至三五％得自脂。脂，往往形成一種保護層，環繞着神經，它是神經的墊子。人體缺乏脂，固然易于病弱，同時亦不能獲得適當量脂溶性的維生素ＡＤＦ等，在生理上有極大的隊，蛋白質是形成組胞生命基本原生質的要素，它的分子非常複雜可是只有很少幾種化學原素包括在它的組織中，多數蛋白質約含五一至五五％的炭，七％的氫三二〇至二三％的氣一五，至二％的硫，有些更含少量的燐質或鐵質，植物能够組成基酸而形成維持生命的蛋白質，所以動物所需的蛋白質大部取自植物。純粹的硤水化物合與張白質在體內發生氧化，大概每克能生四卡路利的熱量，動物或植物性的脂能生的九卡路和的熱。水只是組成食物大部分的重量，它並不能產生什麽能量。人類各稱食物的化學組成，可代表地球上各種物質的橫剖面，不但各種原素都存在於食物之中，同時還得形成一種方式，，使人體容易吸收，假使說身體上缺乏鐵質，那决不能直接吃下鐵礦以補償這種缺陷，因為這些原索，一定要等過特種組成之後，身體方能吸收利用。</p>
<p>現在已經證明，個體健康的條件，至少須有五〇％的礦物質。根據這個標準，平均成人每天必須獲得〇六八克的鈣，鈣對於齒和骨的保存十分軍要，燐也一樣的要緊，鐵質是血液的要素，貧血的指　就是根據血紅素的含量而定。人體每天約有三％的血球在那裏繼續不斷地破壞，要是沒有鐵實補償那末血球的數量便反常而發生貧血症。由此可見食物中的礦物質在生理上也是一件重大的要素。</p>
<p>通常食物的消化程度，混合食物往往較高於單純者。食物的烹煎，目的在縮短消化時間而使它易於吸收，通過全部消化道的時間，約在十二至四十七小時範圍之內，過與不及都是反常現象。烹煮菜類最宜注意用水量，以免礦物質與丙種維生紫的消失。</p>
<p>人生藉食物以維持生命，更以多方的營養而增進健康，食物對於身體的密切關係，實在是値得重視。</p>

<h3 id="c6">×奸的陰謀與國民的任務 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>兵法說：『其用戰也，貴勝，久則鈍兵挫銳，攻城則力屈，久暴師則國用不足。夫鈍兵，挫銳屈力，貨殫，則諸候乘其弊而起。雖有智者，亦不能善其後矣』！這個理由，日本侵略者那裏會不知道呢？侵略戰爭廿三個月以來，到得今日，尤其是到得最近鄂豫邊的大敗和晉西晉南的大敗之後，日×豈非已經完全暴露了牠的兵鈍，銳挫，力屈，貨殫，和國際地位孤立，國內情勢混亂了嗎？然而，日×同時又不能不承認關於日×國際地位的孤立，國內形勢的嚴重，以及我或團結抗戰的堅决，不僅他們「速　速决」的勝算已歸失敗，而且繼之而起的利用汪精衞叛變的『速和速結』的妄想也被打破了！他們還有什麽辦法解救其目前日趨嚴軍的困難與危機呢？他們竟竊取我國兵法『役不再籍，取用於國，糧不三載，取用於敵』的精義，而採取所謂『以戰養戰』的陰謀毒計了，也就是說要用我被佔區域人力物力來支持它的侵略戰爭了。具體的內容，不外是：</p>
<p>第一，指使各地漢奸，建立各個小單位的偽政權，作為鞏固佔領區域的工具：</p>
<p>第二，在×偽重的後方，施行所謂『懷柔』政策、，用一點小惠來收買人心，供他驅使，同時對我淪陷區的同胞大肆各種荒謬宣傳，說我抗日黨派已經分裂，抗戰力量已被破壞，重搖我淪陷區同胞對抗戰勝利的信念；</p>
<p>第三，進行殘酷的剝削與刦掠，企圖榨取我淪陷區同胞的血汗，補充牠們財政的竭蹶；</p>
<p>第四，加緊帮助汪精衞等『和平，反共，救中國』的宣傳煽亂運動，挑撥離間我國內部的團結統一，證衊我國的當局與各界領袖，企圖分化與打消我國的抗戰方量；</p>
<p>第五，冒險推進反英運動，企圖刦奪英法在華一切權益，一面對英肆行敲詐與誘騙，企圖合力壓迫我國屈服。</p>
<p>日×漢奸這種新的陰謀，一樣要遭遇失敗，是無庸疑慮的。不過，我們失敗的輕重與遲速，就要看我們打擊牠這一陰謀對策，是否適當與充分。首先，我們對於日×漢奸實施這一陰謀的具體情形要有充分的了解，牠究竟有些什麽佈置？發生些什麽影響？這些影響的發生在社會機構上與過去政治情形上有什麼根據？其次，我們就必須清楚了解，我們全國尤其是淪陷區×後的抗戰力量到底怎樣？許多做救亡工作的團體與幹部以及個人，無論在政治方面軍事方面，有什麼困難必須加以幫助？有些什麼不應有的不良現象須加以嚴格的糾正？有些什麼言論與行為容易直接間接為日×漢奸利用？而須採取怎樣明快的處理方法？有些什麼優處長處應大公無私地加以發揚，進使全國學習，共爭最後的勝利？</p>
<p>「政治重於軍事」「民衆重於兵隊」尤其是「×軍後方戰鬥重於前綫」，這是領袖昭示全國的二期抗戰的特點，我們能否勝利地進入反攻階段，能否在目前把×人的力量消耗到無法支持下去，這一方面要看我們的新生力量培植得怎樣，同時就要看我們能否使我們淪陷在×後的人力物力不為×用，且為×患；就要看我們能否鞏固團結，堅持抗戰，反對搖動與守舊，增加國際的同情與援助；也就是要看我們能否打破日×漢奸的陰謀毒計。</p>
<p>我們知道日×漢奸的兇狠與殘暴而不注意他的險謀與毒計，是非常不够而且有相當危險的；我們只知道×後的同胞也和其他地方同胞一樣，，在憤恨×奸反抗×奸，而不注意到他們戰門的難險與生活的困苦，而不設法去帮助他們，這更是非常不够而且極為危險的，我們在「安全區」的同胞，在今日就要多多知道上述情形，研究這些情形，多多努力改進，來粉碎日×漢奸的陰謀毒計。</p>
<h3 id="c7">五十萬青年男女　在後方為國服務　從事宣傳救護工作　情緒熱烈工作緊張 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 錫山</p>
<p>在苦幹中求民族解放</p>
<p>（某地通訊）自七七事件發生以來的十九個月中，最使中國靑年感到光榮的，是在救國工作上的勝利，這不僅是得到了全國人士的同情，同時更獲得了全世界人士的贊揚自從中國全面抗戰的開始，中國的靑年們，的確是幹了很多實際的救國工作，這散佈在內地各區域的五十餘萬靑年男女，從任何方面說來，他們的精神，都足以表顯對於國家的熱忱。</p>
<p>事實上，在這全面抗戰之下，每二個靑年，他們都已覺得自己責任的重要，他們由着熱血情緒的激動，已耐不住再呆坐在敎室中，於是他們離開了學校，一部份的靑年，很勇敢的跑上火線，他們參加正式的軍隊，或組起了小單位的游擊隊，從事直接抗×的工作，最好的例子，便是天津，北平各地的靑年大學生，大部份的靑年男女，他們雖沒有站在前線作戰，但他們是很忙碌的後方服務着。</p>
<p>在重慶，成都，長沙，西安這許多區域壞，許多政治上的宣傳工作，受傷戰士的救護工作以及收容難民的工作，今日已完全的由靑年們担任着、最使人敬佩的是來自下江一帶的靑年們，他們在上海一向是過著很舒適的大都市生活，而今日在內地服務着，他們不僅感不到生活的不舒，而且服務的精神更有勝於他人之點。</p>
<p>値得吾們提出的，是靑年婦女參加抗戰工作的努力，在內地的許多醫院中　，都是女學生們在擔任着看為傷兵的工作，最好的現象，她們都把受傷的戰士當作為自已的弟兄一般，她　跟他們談　，慰問，寫家信，唱歌，念讀戰事的消息，她們有一句口號說，「減少傷兵苦痛，恢復傷兵健康，是吾們第一責任』！</p>
<p>許多的靑年婦女，也同樣的受著軍事訓練，她們穿起了成裝，剪短了的頭髮，在太陽初升的時候。她們已整隊的背若槍桿在廣場上操練着。</p>
<p>在××的每一個大學或中學，每星期至少有八小時以上的軍事學科，他們平時的生活，全是軍事化，上堂，進膳，起牀，上操，全在同一的紀律下過若，在郊外，時常有一隊隊年靑的學生軍隊，在作若野戰的演習。敏捷而正確的動作，象徵着每一個都是未來的勇敢的戰士。</p>
<p>在宣傳工作方面，他們是擴大的從事着，同時許多學校的敎授們，亦帮同的參加他們最高的目標，是要提高一般人民的智識，以加强而鞏固民衆受國的情緒，他們决定了四個方針來推動這一個工作：（一）敎會不識字的大衆去寫和讀。（二）啓發大衆的救國思想。（三）訓練農民改良耕種和手工業的生產。（因）訓練人民怎樣來組織自己，以抵抗侵略，在這個計劃下，有許多的靑年們，從事普各種不同的方式來完成這個目的，他們分隊分區的跑到各鄉村各城市去，組織了戲劇和歌詠旅行團，在各地表演着救亡的話劇，並且敎大衆唱救亡的歌曲，大衆歌曲作曲家的劉良模君，他領導了許多的靑年男女，在長沙各地工作着，這些包含着高意識的現實宣傳的手段，是喚醒了大衆的抗戰意志。</p>
<p>在成都的許多大學生，他們組織農村服務團，利用着假期，在附近的各農村工作着，他們創設臨時學校和民衆夜校，召集附近的農民來讀書，組設了流動圖書館，旅行演講團，講述戰時常識如防空。防毒。以及急救。在去年的夏季，重慶各大學的學生，包括復旦大學，曾相繼組織，各省經濟考察團，（亦有加入當局組織的經濟考察團）。至貴陽及西南各省考察，都有相當的成績。</p>
<p>在西北抗戰大學，有許多的靑年男女，在困苦的生活中訓練着，他們每屆畢業的學員，都分配在各地領導着重要的抗戰工作，總計己有五六千人之多。</p>
<p>其次在××，於宋美　女士領導之下，有數百的靑年婦女，也正在訓練中，她們也將負擔起特殊的後方工作。</p>
<p>綜合着說：這一年餘來，中國靑年們在抗戰救亡的工作上，是緊張的，是成功的，每個內地服務着的靑年，他們不光是熱情，而是在實際的苦幹，他們中間沒有個人，而是互相的愛護着團體。在艱苦的爭鬥下，他們希冀打開一條新路，求得眞正的民族解放！</p>

<p>— 流瑩</p>
<p>我們和電訊班杯參謀等集合，向羅浮山之北前進了。一路上×機總是不斷在如上兜圈子，起初，我們因為人太多，還怕給×機發現目標。行了三四里路，就是山深林密的所在了。砲聲，炸彈聲一路上送着我們前進。沿途都有難民向我們問消息，他們關心着家、關心著田園、關心着生命財產、望着烽火發愁發怒。</p>
<p>這時陳團已由福田向羅浮之東南上山，韋團已由羅浮之東靠近羅浮之北，民衆救亡工作者，增城游擊隊、第三游擊區××大隊，都各由不同的方向向羅浮靠攏來了。總之把一切力量集中到羅浮來了。西北兩方面都是充滿了淸朗的大炮聲和機關槍聲。</p>
<p>遙望葫蘆溷</p>
<p>我們向羅浮山一層一層爬上去、路是越老越小，越崎，離地平綫越高了。起初，抬頭望望，灰色的雲霧吞沒了整個的山峯，然而、到達一個山峯，上面又有一個峯，被雲霧吞沒了。</p>
<p>×機從從雲隙中溜過去，和我們成了平一個綫形。行行重行行，又上了一個山巔，是傾盆大雨，雨下得怎麼大，獸機都是瘋狂的飛着，在我們左邊，在後面，不斷盤旋着。不過它的高度已放在我們的足下去了。我感覺到自已的偉大，高潔。砲聲炸，彈聲和荷荷的雨聲、松濤，融成一片。</p>
<p>又到了一座山峯、雨停了。囘首望見乳白色的大東江橫臥在羅浮的脚下，北望便是充滿了炮火，充滿了我們民族抗戰力量聯和鄕了、那邊，在遙遠的山谷裏，一簇小小的樹林，林裏面還露出若隱若現的屋角，劉科昌正凝望着出神，「那便是葫蘆溷，贛故權長瑞琮的家裏」、他指着吿訴了我們。</p>
<p>我們聽到了「葫蘆溷」三個字都無不肅然起敬的、就不的而同停止了脚步前進，望着那邊出神，同時你問這個，我問那個，談起了賴瑞琮抗戰的光榮史來了。</p>
<p>那個村落除藏在山間，生長在羅浮的支脈，看來是很微小的，總共不够二百人，然而，地在抗戰的偉業上，却建立了偉大無比的功績，村裏頭，無論老少男女都在賴鄉長的領導之下，每次對敵作戰，前後出擊已有十次，侵略者的骨灰在給這個小小的村落製裝了三十多包囘去。後來獸兵們沒有不向這個村落低頭的，但，這一支民族的生力軍是緊緊地糾纏着它們。所以有一次大批的漢奸引着五百多敵軍，專門進攻這個村子，賴鄉長也在這一次犧牲了。因此，博羅抗戰史中，又寫下了光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>這個小的村子，起了這樣大的作用，正說明我們動員工作做得不够。政治的進步，配合不上軍事，同時益反映出保甲制度的欠健全，假如所有的鄕村都如胡蘆村，所有的鄕長都能如賴鄉長，×人雖兇，必定無法橫行。我憶起了我們輓賴鄕長的聯句：「鄉長俱如君，×寇雖兇何足畏。村民齊奮起，人心不死慰英靈」。</p>
<p>犧牲了一位女同志</p>
<p>我們離開火綫已有四十里了——到了剛距離酥醪六里的地方，一條爆布橫斷我們的去路，這條山洪是從羅浮頂上倒瀉下來的，水勢像崩山般奔湃而下，山澗的樹木都給衝搖搖曳曳，雖然水的深度僅二三尺，但，雄壯的力量是不能不使戮們躊躇的。所以我們對這條僅有六尺闊度的山澗費了許多精神和時間來考慮，雨是不斷傾盆的倒下來，後退沒有鄉村住宿，要望短時間內這條山澗退淺，是不可能的。我和陳劉二同志就成為探險隊。攀藤扶葛向上游爬進，探索途徑，我們像老鼠般爬上不够二丈，就有了兩岸交叉的樹，我們使個眼色——因為水的衝擊和雨聲使到僅離數尺的人就聽不到對方的談話，就緣攀着那橫過去的小樹，一步一步的剗過去，脚給水打到歪斜的，</p>
<p>爬上了對岸的山腰，舉手招示他們，他們也依樣畫葫蘆，一個一個的走過來了。當然，個個更該濕透了，雨衣也失了效用。</p>
<p>十多個人都登了「彼岸」，那邊，只有挑伕三人，和參謀處的重要物件，這是無法挑過來的，就叫挑佚和胡班長在這裏等候增城游擊隊政訓主任，和看守公物。因為劉政訓主任患着病，落在後頭了，不過有阮參謀和他愛人躍着他，還有衞兵，大槪是一名。所以我們就比較放心。但，正因為「放心」，變成了「痛心」。</p>
<p>我們通過了韋團梁營的警戒線，到了酥醪觀不久，就接到某女同志在那洶湧山澗中犧牲的消息，速尸首都找不見，我們甚為悲痛。我們明白某女同志只有一個，就是劉政訓主任的夫人跟着他來，她為民族，為了丈夫，被那兇湧的山洪吞沒。是光榮的，不過我們得提高警惕，凡救亡工作者，對於攀山越嶺，游水，爬樹都必需練習，嬌滴滴的小姐更要加緊去學習。</p>
<p>被焚燬前一夜的酥醪</p>
<p>我們冒着大雨，通過了警戒綫，在排哨位上士兵吿訴我們，距離酥醪十里遠的獨嶺坳已發現×人，這裏有馬上受攻擊的可能，當時我們聽了都感覺到一種幸運，萬一×人與我們同一時間到來，我們左側是×人，前面是我軍隊，那麼我們就腹背受擊，結果會糟透了的。</p>
<p>兜過了許多矮小的箝在山邊田裏的泥屋前後，到酥醪觀，已是七點鐘，寺觀已閉了門，幾經交涉，我們才得以登堂入室。呌門時裏面道十現出了沉重的應聲，有的開窻子望我們這班貴客。同時，隣村的狗也叫起來。</p>
<p>酥醪觀是羅浮山各寺觀中最龐大的一個，裏面道士不下百人，他們都是四十歲起碼的男人，各有一所房間，右片是客庽，每個房千都很雅潔，與其設是寺觀，毋寧說是山閒的大酒店。因為他們是準備專為遊客住宿的，每位收銀不等，開飯就規定每位二角。要是太平盛世，在這個夏天是很多富豪貴客們來這裏玩的。道士們也誇耀着他們的凉潔，歡迎夏天，可是現在不同了。你怎麽樣幽靜淸雅的地方，×人的炮火都會光顧到的。</p>
<p>我們到酥醪寺後，第一課是點查名額，第二便是脫衣服，解包裹，焙衣服，不够十分鐘，二個炭爐火燃着了，大家圍攏來，炭煙和濕布發出的熱味騰滿整間屋子。</p>
<p>我們吃晚飯了，獨嶺均發出了炮聲。一位同志誤為倒大樹。梁營長那邊沒有人去聯絡，究竟×情有無變化，我們還疑問着。可是我們斷定敵人晚上定不敢進犯酥醪，因為地形上不利它們夜行軍，而且我們還有許多軍隊在這裏。</p>
<p>大家疲乏極極，十時，我們已靜睡，夜是黑暗的恐佈的。</p>
<p>「麻榨無敵蹤，陳團×營集瀾石，……獨嶺均下面發現敵便衣隊數十。正派隊搜索中，福田情况不明……本營今晚不移動」。這是梁營長給我們的情報。送到時已午夜十二時，但，大家都起身來輪流的看。</p>

<h3 id="c34">與小莫索里尼決鬥記 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>血灑長空</p>
<p>一九三七年九月廿八日，西班牙政府志願軍美人特立克。狄更生，和莫索里尼長子白魯諾。莫索里尼作空中决鬥，下面是狄更生的報吿。</p>
<p>我在西班牙共計作戰十六個月，一九三七年秋、在加斯德隆為『紅翼』隊的領隊，那時小莫索里尼也指揮國民軍空軍一隊，駐巴爾馬，與我們遙遙相對。</p>
<p>那是八月之末，一個晚上，我從長官雷斯上校處，得悉小墨在國民軍電台廣播，向政府軍的五架飛機挑戰，這或者是小墨鼓動士氣的一法不料，决鬥終於實現了</p>
<p>當時我立卽發電，願獨戰小莫，後來又發電催促，終究在十天後，得到他的　覆：</p>
<p>茲接受狄更生隊長的提議，定於九九月二十八日正午單獨接戰，地點在兩軍根戰地的中央，高度一萬五千尺，兩方各帶同偵察機兩架。絕對不許參加戰　。雙方相遇後。卽作一倒圓轉，表示開始作戰。一方承認失敗時，可將手套縛在長圍巾上　出。以上各點，請狄君同意遵守。白　諾·莫索里尼·</p>
<p>以後，我並未做任何特種的準備，我的飛機是蘇聯的波音式，馬力一千零五十備有雙管維克式機槍四座，電器控制翼旁的機槍兩具。</p>
<p>那天到了，四位同伴駕兩架偵察機先出發，一刻鐘後，我也鼓勇向巴爾馬前進。</p>
<p>時當正午，四架偵察機正在我上面盤旋，在國民軍的　方，出現了一個黑點，那便是小莫索里尼，駕了一千三百馬力的單翼機　來。</p>
<p>我們同時飛一大圈又倒轉一次，於是肉搏開始了。我所看到的是×人機槍中的火花，聽到的是子彈穿過耳邊的尖叫，身上感到的是子彈打到翼上的震動。我們互相迎上，在幾英寸中短兵相接。</p>
<p>兩機分開了，繼之以半圓形的滾動，距離極近。我可以辦淸莫氏面上的各部。我噓了一口氣，囘轉機身，迎前接戰。</p>
<p>以後的十五分鐘，更是緊張，因為各種動作太快了，我差不多不能記淸。但是我　有一種動作，他一定有同樣的或者更好的。敵機馬力勝我二百五十，所以速度帮助了他不少。</p>
<p>我的飛機震得很厲害，蘇聯飛機不能多加超限的載重和馬力，這影醫我的目的不少。</p>
<p>昇，降，轉圈，滾飛，這都是幾秒鐘中的連續的動作　動的速度，使四肢的血脈停留，空氣一點不鬆的打擊在我的身上，發動機和機槍的聲音使我腦子麻木，直到失去聽覺為止。</p>
<p>在我的經騐上，我從來不曾做過這樣多子彈的目標。</p>
<p>我們在下降了—一萬四千尺，一萬一千，八千……。我們的偵察機也　旋着，注視着。</p>
<p>忽然，我發現左臂有了創口，鮮血直噴，于是立卽下降，這其實是錯誤，因為莫氏正在我的尾後，灌注他的鉛彈！</p>
<p>我竭力平衡自已，制止馬達的前進，橫滑到旁邊。等敵機衝過時，給以打擊。這次我看見打中了他，因為他的飛機蕩了一下，事後我聽見他的腿部受了傷——雖然我們無從證實——我想當在這時吃中子彈的。但是一秒鐘之內，又他囘來了。</p>
<p>五千尺，四千，三千。十八分鐘，二十分鐘，我們繼續肉博。當時我饑而且疲，彈子打破了我的儀器，玻璃打在我的面部。我想我要失敗了。但是我抓住了最後的機會，同時解開我的圍巾。</p>
<p>我裝作打圈的樣子，轉到頂上，當時我正是他的一個廣大的目標，我縮小自已到最小的地位，預料鉛彈將搗碎我的身體，但是結果沒有。當我轉好以後，我得到了機會，敵機的目標，對我的　槍好像有屋子那樣大，我的心跳得更　害，我的手指開始拉緊機槍，猛射一陣。於是我看見他的手舉起了，黑色的物件從他的飛機中擲出，張開白色的長尾，　巾和手套！</p>
<p>我欣幸着他不知道我幾乎也要做他同樣的動作</p>
<p>當我平飛的時候，要看見他揮手示意，傾斜他的飛機向前、表示敬意，於是我們分道囘去。</p>
<p>在二十二分鐘的空戰中，我的飛機多了三百二十六個彈孔，我很幸運的祇受到一處臂傷。此後白魯諾。莫索里尼就不是巴爾馬空軍的隊長了。</p>

<p>現在，我來一個建議，贊助保護牲畜。就是請本港人士，乾脆不要吃牛，不要吃鷄鴨，更不要吃貓。</p>
<p>香港老鼠之多，之兇，之狠，是大家領敎的。關于這，有一位先生列出一個理由，說：這里貓已經很少，結果，仍要烹成「龍虎鬥」。而被先生大人們作為充飢之用，於是乎貓則愈少，鼠則愈多，愈猖獗，而不可收拾了。這樣說法，確否不知；姑妄言之，姑妄記之。</p>

<p>— 勞上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，德輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着八百萬金條、自紐約到德國去，邱克斯公司的無線電員傑克，與機械昌比爾也趁這　去遊歷歐洲。在船上傑克代理無線電工作時，接着個怪消息。說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息。旅客要求減低速力，船長不肯…</p>
<p>『我們已經察出有冰　啦，也許他們會放汽筒，讓囘聲來處置那座大山呢。』</p>
<p>「今晚，他們不會放　筒的，船長已經下了决心，不能露出一點蹤跡怕巡洋艦知道我們在甚麽方向。我是要到甲板上去跑跑了，反正無綫電裏若有甚麽來了，鈴子會響的。你跟我一塊去嗎？」</p>
<p>『好的，不過這簡直不是一個能散步的晚上呢。』</p>
<p>『無論如何、比什麽也不曉得，呆蹲在這艙裏頭要好些吧！』</p>
<p>『你顯得很激動，傑克。』</p>
<p>『這倒幷不全為了我自己，你想，這未幾千噸的鋼船開足二十四海里的飛奔，前頭有着冰山，這不分明是瘋了。』</p>
<p>『得啦在海裏頭，給長的話就是法律，無庸分辯，我們只能望好處想吧。」</p>
<p>在下層甲板上，有成堆的旅客，　在那遮蔽光綫的厚幕背後，上層　甲板上，却只有傑克和比　兩個人。他們雖然努力談些旁的問題，但是心裏却老記念着冰山。看看前面黑森森的，而船正如飛地向黑暗裏鑽，覺得四週。有點幽靈般感覺。</p>
<p>時間一刻刻的過去，霧幷沒有減輕，雖然是八月裏的天氣，寒氣却侵入骨髓。傑克和比爾差不多决定囘艙去了，突然間，前面瞭望的人發出一聲尖銳的叫喊，不由自主的，比爾一把抓住　克的手臂，這種緊張的局頭，遠超過預料他倆要臨到的。</p>
<p>頃刻間，死神似乎已經來臨了。在　霧裏面，隱約的，看得出一個戶大的白色鬼魅，它矗立　，差不多齊及船上的桅杆，顯得似乎船前垂下了一堵　壁。</p>
<p>在架樑上立刻起了大　的，叫，來了粗澀的囘聲，下面旅客們的甲板上，一個婦人尖聲的慘叫，接着　驚　的哭聲，只一雲工夫，一陣輕微的震撼，連着就一陣長而劇烈的戰慄威脅着船身，這大塊的冰山顯然的，是裂開了。但是，事實上，這船是不可思議的，兩旁只受着一點輕微的磨擦，就安然的溜盪過去了，在減低一點速力之後，又繼續着她的路程。</p>
<p>『　死裏逃生啦！』當冰山消滅在濃霧裏之後，傑克喊起來。</p>
<p>『當眞的，我以為我們完了哩，』比爾慘然的說，『這一點子事眞費大勁，咳！』</p>
<p>下面甲板上受驚的羣衆，起了一陣喧嘩，到現在，才能聽出一個歇斯的里的女人在叫喊，尖銳，有力地。猜想起來，是對一個船員所發，他大的在設法使他們安靜一點，然而，受了突如其來的驚恐的人們，却嘩閙起來。</p>
<p>『他們到這邊來了！』傑克忽然叫起來，可以聽得出。一羣脚步聲衝上來，快到無線電欄的地位了。『比爾，馬上，我們正首當其衝。」</p>
<p>「是呀！若是他們這一羣，跑到了小艇跟前，他們就會像瘋鬼一般亂竄，我們怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「跑到無綫電窒裏去，在書桌抽屜里，為安全起見，有兩柄手槍，一柄是鮑佛的，一柄是我的，趕</p>
<p>比爾原不用着多久去這一次、但是，就在他走開的一忽工夫，這些驚慌萬狀的客人們，已經差不多穿過長走道、跑到救生艇跟前了，傑克將身子正　在前頭。</p>
<p>「放冷靜點，每個人！」他大聲的叫着。「沒有危險了。』</p>
<h3 id="c43">一日一人 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯似乎仍然是個相當神秘的國家、許多人都想去探探。這里有一個故事，是眞，是假。恕不負責。</p>
<p>話說一次，一個美國記者到了莫斯科，他紛訪紅色要員。</p>
<p>他先見到西米諾夫委員，一個可視的人物。祗是一件奇怪事，那辦公桌上堂堂正正的　着一隻大痰盂，眞叫他不解。</p>
<p>西米諾夫同志，一這位記者採訪新聞了，『請恕我發問，你為什麼把這東內放在桌上呀？』</p>
<p>進知道，這問題竟叫西米諾夫怒氣冲天。「那是我的痰盂一，他嚷道：「我高興擺在什麽地方，就擺在會麽地方。」</p>
<p>在李　諾支委員辦公室里，一隻椅子從天花板上吊下來，這位好問的記者，又發問了。李委員也勃然大怒起來。「那是我的椅子，』他怒氣冲冲地道。『我高興這樣擺。」</p>
<p>最後，這位記者去謁見史塔林了。他便問起這些委員們的奇特行動。</p>
<p>『　，不要理他們好了，』史塔林微笑地說：「那些人都是傻瓜。」</p>
<p>『但是，地們如果是傻瓜』，記者一步也不肯放鬆，『怎麽會做委員呢？』</p>
<p>這句話，也叫史塔林怒髮衝冠了。</p>
<p>「他們是我的傻瓜，他咆哮着。「我把他們擺在我高興擺的地方。」希特勒的四年計劃</p>

<h3 id="c44">同鄉 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>某性人蜂屯蟻聚着的某機關，可以稱之為「某姓祠堂」，同樣，某地人蛆　蠅集着的某機關，也就可以稱之為一某地同鄉會或「某地會館」。</p>
<p>這種「同鄉會」或「會館」的造成，當然是在上者君子不忘其舊，援引而來的，遠之如泗水亭長的安置豐沛　沽，近之如狗肉將軍的安揷掖縣剃頭扦脚之流。於是在這「會」裏，若不是皇親國戚，一定是身穿黃馬褂的王公大臣　貝子貝勒。然後再由他們呼朋引類，　轉援引，形成了淸一色的洋洋大觀。劉安得道，雞犬皆仙，你若身非雞犬，就休想揷足其間　如果你自顧堂堂七尺之軀，要想取雞犬而代之，那就更加　也動不得，其不為雞啄犬咬者幾希。蓋劉安是牠們的劉安，與你何干！</p>
<p>同姓的結合是宗法社會的中堅，同樣，同鄉的援引是封建制度的遺風。我不忍說宗法社會的不對，更同樣，我又安敢說封建制度的不良。並且博學多聞的先生們，還時常在援今證古明示封建制度的不可厚非，而同鄉關係的存在是必然的，並且必要的。他們說：</p>
<p>中國人到了外國去，中國人在外國便都是同鄉；將來地球上的人到了火星或任何行星上去，地球上人在別的行星上都便是同鄉；太陽系內的人到了別的恒星系內去，太陽糸內的人在別的恒星系內便都是同鄉；這一個宇宙中人到了別一個宇宙中去，這一個宇宙中人在別一個宇宙中便都是同鄉；……那末，縮而小之，逼而緊之，以一機關而論，一認同鄉，便倍覺親熱，而斷定非我族類，其心必異，也就不足為怪了。</p>
<p>有時我要殺風景的說，旣然在同一個宇宙內都是同鄉，或者就近些說，旣然中國人都是同鄉，有了這樣的大　鄉還不好麼？為什麽一定還要那儘在螺獅殼內做道場的小同鄉呢？先生們却說，這是分工合作，集腋成袋：有了小同鄉，自然容易合成大同鄉；大家組織小同鄉，排斥非同鄉：先王之道，斯為美，他們一拾出先王來，我只好悶聲勿響，因為我到底是個現代人，還不懂生王。</p>
<p>不過人心到底是肉做的，想想同鄉會一的好處，實在也不可埋沒。例如：同鄉會有丙舍，使你死了不致沒有葬身之地：同鄉會會運柩，使你死了會狐正首邱，魂歸故土：……素來講究死後風光的中國人，還須有賴於同鄉會，方才能够瞑目。那末具體而微的「同鄉會」，某機關，安知牠不會安揷活人之外，更安置死人呢？我們就格外應該在這一點上稱頌牠的功德無量了。</p>
<p>為了同鄉有這許多好處，听以一般人都喜歡認同鄉。假使同鄉中有個大人物，或任何出名的人，那當然是他們的光榮，尤其要逢人稱道之處，鄰省也是同鄉；在一省之內，同府屬或同道屬或同專區就是同鄉同鄉的起點本來是縣，在必要上一認就此擴大了。甚至早已只有同鄉之名而無同鄉之實，還是要同鄉同鄉不去口，蓋同鄉項一個名詞，實在大使人入迷了。</p>
<p>「錢塘蘇小　鄉親」，「鄉親」便是「同鄉」，「侯石翁」是那樣的沾沾自喜着。「老鄉親」在天津登臺，博得了多少歡迎，「停船暫相問，或恐是同鄉」，嬌滴的聲音，視見其為人。……</p>
<p>可是你要認同鄉的他，他印偏不認同鄉的你，這事也很多。原因是這個你當然是流落的，這個他當然是得法的；你將有損於他，他當然不認你。漢朝的公孫弘嘆息着說：「寗逢惡賓，不逢故人」，便是這個道理。而出賣同鄉以邀功的，也未嘗沒有。據說：從前做御史的，他所彈幼的人，往往是他的親戚故舊，同鄉，因為只有同鄉的劣跡，他才能够知道得詳細，可以免去風聞的錯誤。……</p>
<p>寫到這裏，却又使人對於同鄉要不寒而慄了，怎麼辦呢？</p>

<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——徐州突圍囘憶記</p>
<p>走過了那片麥地，前面是雨隻光禿禿的石山夾着的一個險口，在那隘口旁屹立着一座鋪着錄草的高山，——是那末巍峨，險要，只要對方配備着一挺機關槍在選裏，我們是休想通過這谷道的。但他們却攔阻在公路前面的山頭上，他們以為我們一定要沿着那公路走的，不想我們却繞道由這邊來了。</p>
<p>正走在那狹窄的隘口裏時，忽然，一隻飛機從後面追了來，大家雖然有些着急，要想趕快散開，可是，在這毫無掩蔽的崎嶇的谷道中，却散也走不開，沒有辦法，就只有大着膽子，沒有管到似的，仍　散着。</p>
<p>通過了這隘口，坐在一隻山脚旁，在等候着後而的張師長，只見那源源不斷的隊伍像洪水似的，由那隘口裏走了出來，眼睛也望花了。忽然，三隻重轟炸機響着怕人的沉重的聲昔飛了來，人馬忙散開伏在路旁和麥田裏，但一部份人馬，却無處可躱，只有在路上蹲着，任那馬在吃　路邊的靑草。</p>
<p>那三隻耀着夕陽的光輝的重轟炸機，悠然的在天空裏兜了一個圈子，飛到那隘口的上空，突然一雅降低了下來。</p>
<p>轟隆！轟隆！</p>
<p>一個火光迸裂起來後，隨着一片稀薄的黑烟冒了起來，飄蕩在天空裏，慢慢的消失了。</p>
<p>山野裏是與常的寂靜。只有那嗡嗡的聲音單調的在響若。</p>
<p>兜了一個圈子後，那三隻重轟炸機飛到不遠的前方，像打雷似的又響起了一長串爆炸聲：</p>
<p>——轟隆！轟隆！轟隆！……</p>
<p>一隻飛機向向後飛過來，突然降低了下來，半翹着翅膀，向麥田裏掃射着：</p>
<p>——噠噠噠噠……</p>
<p>隨着特務連的弟兄，我門整齊的躺在山脚下，眼睜睜的望着那三隻飛機，帶着驕傲和恥辱，瘋狂的在天空　巡行着，心裏充滿了極度的憤怒！</p>
<p>太陽落下山去了，天空裏陰沉沈的，夜色爬到了原野的遠方，顯得有些灰漠漠的時候，那三隻飛機才揚飛去了。</p>
<p>伏在路旁和麥田吳休息够了的弟兄們，爬了起來，臉上浮若歡笑：</p>
<p>「你媽的，天天來轟炸，也不見把老子炸死掉！」</p>
<p>「他們這些大騙子，今天轟炸回去，不知又要如何的向他們的老百性宣傳着：我們今天被他們炸死了多少了！」</p>
<p>「他們的老百姓眞是可憐！自己的血汗錢只是被他們的軍閥騙了買一些炸彈，來丟在我們的土地上，還天天受着他們的那欺騙的宣傳，真是寃枉！」</p>
<p>踏着蒼茫的暮霞，沿着一條高低不平的土路，隊伍又向前出發了。</p>
<h3 id="c46">坑（下） <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 電長</p>
<p>他在上面嗚嗚地像唱歌起來了，多難聽，慎　慘慘的。</p>
<p>這時，我底肩祗露出地面一些些；望望前面　　中正掛若一個血紅的太陽，空鑛鑛地，冷淸淸地；……我才着了忙，揮了揮額上的汗，又掘，掘，掘，</p>
<p>現在，我底身子完全給埋在坑裏了，整整一個頭還在地面上，掘，掘，手兒已有些酸痛，眞他媽媽的！</p>
<p>我打了個寒噤，於是又裝着掘，掘，偷眼睢見他把碎鈔票授了過來，又扮上一個惡鬼臉，我給他一個不理會。他却重踏着脚嘰咕着踱了過去。我忍不住暗罵着，順手把剷揚一揚：嘩啦，泥污灑了過去，那傢伙的綁腿上也濺了好些，他猛可地囘過頭，忙又退下幾步，畏縮地，把手槍緊緊地揑着，扳了……却又放了不來，祗恨恨地咕嚕着，我不禁忍着笑，俛下掘，掘；又想把揚過去，再濺他一頭一臉，但這會却不曾做。</p>
<p>我平視着祗見前面兩隻腿在移動過來，於是又俛下去掘掘；忽然拍的又轉了過去，脚步聲漸漸遠了我底耳朶，我才又透了一口氣，把泥都向後撥上了，地而上更堆得高高的。</p>
<p>我想，要是那傢伙從背後來，蹴上幾脚，把泥全掃下，我可整個都埋葬在這裏了。</p>
<p>我額上的汗汨汨地流着：光景眞成為掘你老子的墳？這是我底墳墓嗎？咳，越想越是，却越寒心……我便急急的囘過頭，聳起脚尖望着，又怱忙地剷着坑壁，底下拚命的挖出幾步泥梯來。</p>
<p>一會，耳邊果然有上微細的脚步聲，我於是埠緊隆，把右脚踏着坑壁，齊着地平望過去：那傢伙的兩隻腿忽然輕輕地向後轉了，却又點定。</p>
<p>我馬上踏上了一級，心口跳呀跳的跳個不停，却見那傢伙正舉着步槍瞄準　面一個跑來的人。</p>
<p>「砰——」檢聲劃破了長空。我忙着縮下，等了一會，再用鏟撐起一看，前面兩隻腿却抖呀抖的退了過來，那傢伙膝頭向兩邊左右一　，一收，又站定了。</p>
<p>「砰——」我想跑來的人完了，便伏在坑壁邊靜聽，皮靴擦着地面的聲音很淸晰，我又點起脚尖，兩隻顫動的腿離開我底頭祗五六尺光景。突然，我下意識地興奮了起來，挈着倏的從坑壁中爬出，伏在地上滾了過去；但那傢伙却立刻很機敏的囘過頭，對若我像瘋狗般地用步槍刺下。</p>
<p>「砰——」我眼前一黑，冒着槍聲猛勁地挺了起來，乘勢一鏟在他肩上劈個止若，他就僵直地倒了下去。</p>
<p>我拭拭額上的汗，很驕傲地對這段橫着的黃蠟燭笑了笑。我又遠遠地一望，那個人正向這邊走來。</p>
<p>「哈哈，是鷺鶿阿八嗎？」我看淸是他，便喊了起來一我救了你底命了！」</p>
<p>他慢呑呑地走近了，手中提着駁壳，很從容地說：『我在那邊瞧若你挖掘墳墓巳經好些時候了，現在你葬了他吧。』</p>
<p>我便過去仔細看看，地上却滿流若血，我看他肩上的創痕有多少深——這正是我底傑作呢，這麽有力的一劈。</p>
<p>但傢伙肩上却連衣服也不曾破碎一些，血却汨汨地從背上流出。</p>
<p>我才明白了，很慚愧地向鷺鶿阿八打招呼：</p>
<p>「我給灰孫子掘墳掘了好半天，眞累死了：謝謝你，帮帮我扛到那坑裏去好嗎？」</p>

<p>— 士的</p>
<p>假如世上本來沒有眞理，我應該替牠加上這一條；假如巳經有了許參眞理，我祇相信這一條：「意志是人類的第一生命。」</p>
<p>要不是自己的心裏早立下這條信仰，也許在兩年前會為那一樁挫敗而自殺；倘若沒有這句話的鼓勵，我要驚詫地詢問自己：為甚麼近幾年來從不曾因一件失意的事而徜過一滴淚？</p>
<p>目前，無數的人毀了家，可是他們不向誰訴一聲苦。他們感到，應付艱苦的時代，堅忍的鬥志比獲得別人的同情更可珍貴。</p>

<p>七、戰時空氣瀰漫下的漢中</p>
<p>澳中（南鄭），在四天受苦難的旅途中所渴望着，巴不得早一刻鐘祇太的漢中，終于在十四日下午三時抵達了。跳下車，繳了票，提着行李出車站，站門口，為憲兵行李檢查處。我向一憲兵說：</p>
<p>「對不起，請你把我的行李檢查檢査！」</p>
<p>我把皮箱子放下來，想要開鎖子。不知我有什麼力量使他相信我，他說：</p>
<p>「行了，你出去吧！」</p>
<p>這特，另一憲兵在檢查同來的三位學生的行李，一本一本翻開他們的書籍看。他說道：</p>
<p>「我知道你們學生是帶不了什麼東西的，就是要檢査你們看的什麽書。因為有許多書你們不知道是違禁了啊。」</p>
<p>出了車站，坐黃包車南向入城，一望城牆，還頗堅牢，城門處為雙重城牆，城門上也如北方各都市一樣，有三層的古式城樓，上書「雍梁鎖」四大字。進了城門，卽停宿于右手旁的復興大旅社。旅社，客棧很多；這是較好的一家。為二層木造房子，油漆頗新鮮；房分樓上特等房，每天一元五角；樓上甲等房每天一元。樓下乙等房每天八角；丙等房每天六角。棉被另計，每條一角。我住樓上單房，傢私僅有一板床，用麥桿當床毡，沒有枕頭：長桌子一張，兼作盆子架洗臉用，和一個木衣架。四壁糊着花紙，還乾爭；有一木格子窗，糊着薄土紙代玻璃；面向城牆，光綫，空氣還不壞，比較綿陽縣，廣元縣那種兩角錢一晚的客棧，是像天堂一樣地好了。</p>
<p>環城巡視一週，商店仍全是木造平房，馬路頗窄，也壞。鐘錶舖頗多，也有享得利的分店；照相舘也不少，而且裝簧得最華麗；這地方的人，莫不是很喜歡帶鰥和照相嗎？服裝店，洗衣館也不少。有生活，兵學等三四家書店，但書不多。市民穿着似略較沿途所見的要好些；沿街看到穿草綠絨軍衣的軍人；也許搬到這裏工作的公務員頗多，偶爾看到衣履整齊的女人。又因為一則是此地處華北華中戰場的中間，較近前綫；再則是有和的緣故吧，馬路上抗戰標語和漫畫，寫的貼的，遍地皆是。抗戰空氣，似較成都濃厚得多。在數處路旁，看到一片頹垣瓦礫，工人還在挖掘着。（未完）</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>『迎來送往』雖然是社交上的「例行公事』：可是　衷心的誠意却有不同的級度。</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團一抵香港，此開歡迎的高潮就汹湧起來。中救　憑了什麼而博得僑胞這樣的愛護？答案很簡單：他們克服了在大時代中應該揚　的生活方式，與士兵及民衆同甘同苦。在嚴肅的工作中，虛心地學習。他們用戲奙及種種可能的方法，在　　南北戰場二十個月中不知感動了多少千萬的軍民。——這樣一　為抗戰而　生，在抗戰中長成的有熱有力的團體，博得人們的愛護，並不是偶然的。</p>
<p>二個月來，「中救」在香港的生活　態相　　表現證明他們並不　負歡迎者的　　。最低限度、「中救」在精神方面已　　了　　有心向上的同胞，使人深　地　驗到，嚴格的　津。嚴肅的生活，高度的熱情，正確的認識是組成一個健全的團體不能咸缺的要素。『中救』在劇運方面，使人深深地體認到反映時代推進時代的國防劇的偉大作用，給劇運工作者一個有力的鼓勵，給對於國防劇仍有成見者一個反省的機曾。</p>
<p>因此，「中救」在將出國繼讀宣傳的時候，「歡送」更來得有意義，歡送者更具有高度的誠意。</p>
<p>各界賑聯會就於昨天下午一時在華商總會四樓圖書館聯合各僑國開會歡送、並舉行贈旗禮，藉壯行色，而勵來茲。</p>
<p>參加歡送會者主方有記者公會代表李　　，婦女兵災會代表劉慶　，女靑年會代表費招若蘭，婦女新運會代表熊茂昭，蘇安平，　聲慈善社代表陳蘭芳　國棉，東　聲院代表林型生，　聯商會代表林培生等，實方則有正　團長金山王瑩賀全體救亡劇團團員共數十人濟濟一堂，異常熱鬧，雖然天氣十分悶熱，彼此歡敘暢談，內心却十分勸慰。用茶點後主席李建豐首先致詞，大意是謂今天的敘會，是招待會亦是歡送會。吾們今天站在救亡陣綫上，都是救亡工作之一員，所以今天可以說是工作者一次親熱的會見。在今日環境中，吾們祗有認淸目標，一致實幹硬幹苦幹。黃招若蘭繼起致詞，對該團工作及團員服務精神亦多所獎勉。</p>
<p>金山王瑩先後起立致答詞，大意謂本團此次出國道經香港，逗留已歴兩月，眼見香港僑胞對于救國工作非常熱烈，覺得無眼快慰，出國之後，一定將香港僑胞救國的熱烈情形宣揚于海外各地僑胞，使得五相激勵，本團在港期間，備受各界僑胞歡迎，獎勉有加，內心愧不敢當，今後自當益勵初志，以報國內外同胞之愛護。詞畢，華商總會曹學愚鐘聲社盧國棉相繼演說，都是對於該團多所讃揚。最後舉行贈旗禮。計記者公會　旗一面上書「攻心為上」。賑聯會贈旗一面上書「現身說法」。李建　個人贈旗一面上書「口誅」。各有深刻寓意，用資互勉。由主席代表致贈，救亡劇團團長金山接受，至下午三時許才盡歡散會。</p>
<p>杳該團在利舞台公演時，向隅者極多。現應本港僑胞之要求，將于下月初在九龍作臨別紀念之獻演。公演畢，卽離港首途。關于領取護照各項手續經在汕頭辦妥。此次出國行期預定八個月，工作之目的地是菲律濱。南洋羣島及美洲之舊金山檀香山等地。</p>
<p>至於該團的工作計劃大致可分為精神與經濟兩方開。關于精神方面，採用戲劇，文字，演講，畫片展覽及其他種種方法，使僑胞深切認識祖國在艱苦中的光明前途，過去的出錢出力，一點亦沒有浪費。關於經濟方面，計劃籌募五十萬元鉅款，其用途預算一，在戰區設立傷兵收容站，傷兵醫院。及文化供應姑等。二、在後方建立出征軍人家屬收容院，抗戰陣亡將士遺孤收容院，殘廢軍人敎養院等。</p>
<p>我們相信以「中救」過去的能力與精神，必能完成這個偉大的任務。我們香港的僑胞亦應該鼓勵他們，帮助他們完成這個任務。就此祝「中救」一帆風順，後會有期。下一次的聚會，就是聚集一切反攻的力量，參加祖國最後勝利的最末一戰，珍重吧！我們在工作上見面。</p>

<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>「新體操」是什麽、什麽時候發現了「新體操」、恐怕有人會發生這樣疑問、在這所謂「新體操」尙未普及全國以前、（廣西未見這種體操、西南共餘各省如何、不敢武斷）未行過的發生疑問、是不足為怪的、因此在未寫本文前、新舊體操的的界說、似乎有解釋的必要</p>

<p>Now is the great era of the 20th century, an era when the old social system has developed to its peak and is beginning to collapse dramatically. It is also an era when the new ideal society is born and growing stronger. This is an era when dawn is about to break and darkness displays its last vestiges of power. It is a very turbulent, very difficult, and very great era.</p>
<p>We, the young masses, are growing up in this era, neither too early nor too late. We cannot help but lament the unprecedented darkness and suffering, but we should rejoice even more at the scene of unprecedented great battles. How worthy of song and tears is the life of modern youth! How much more should the life of modern youth strive to eliminate the old and usher in the new, to create a glorious history! "The responsibility is heavy and the road is long." None of us young people growing up in this era should underestimate ourselves.</p>
<p>"Modern Youth" is launched in this newspaper today, without any exaggerated mission or profound ideals. We hope that this "Modern Youth" will become the most loyal and best companion of modern youth, a gathering place for modern youth to learn, work, and rest, a venue for modern youth to speak and act for themselves. We want to record here the traces of the struggles of the youth of this great era, and we also want to discuss here the experiences and lessons of the lives and struggles of youth in ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign.</p>
<p>Although our expectations are not great, they cannot be realized without the guidance of advanced youth social leaders and the mutual assistance of the broad masses of youth! At the beginning of this publication, we dare to express our infinitely warm and devout hopes for your guidance, criticism, and contributions! Let us not fail the great era of the 20th century, let us move forward hand in hand calmly and joyfully, towards that brand new ideal era!</p>

<h3 id="e2">Expanding Compulsory Education for Women <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Aying</p>
<p>Whether the construction work of ×× is completed or not, the mobilization of the vast number of women, who account for half of the population, has a decisive effect. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, how to mobilize the vast masses of women who are dormant has long been regarded as a very serious and urgent problem to be solved. As for the central key to solving this problem, it is to immediately intensify the basic education and universal education for these vast masses of women.</p>
<p>At this year's "March 8th International Women's Day Commemoration," the advanced women in Hong Kong also began to feel the importance of education work and determined to use the more than one thousand yuan of righteous funds obtained from the sale of commemorative items at the conference as funding for expanding compulsory education work for women. In the past three months, how much progress has been made on the resolutions at that time? The Women's Federation was automatically dissolved. At the last meeting, it was decided to hand over this work entirely to the Young Women's Christian Association. Can this be said to be entrusted properly?</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Young Women's Christian Association has been recognized as the most well-established and historically significant women's organization in Hong Kong. It has also paid attention to women's education work earlier than others, and has indeed put in a lot of effort, with considerable experience and achievements.</p>
<p>Welcome criticism! Welcome submissions!</p>
<p>Now, the 600,000 uneducated female workers and poor housewives in Hong Kong and Kowloon are still hoping with the greatest enthusiasm that the Young Women's Christian Association can, as soon as possible, put forward a plan and earnestly implement it based on the resolution of the Women's Federation.</p>
<p>First, we believe that the Young Women's Christian Association should regard this work as a great social undertaking; it should call on a wider range of enthusiastic people and cadres to participate; it should mobilize various social groups and female students from various schools to take joint responsibility. We advocate that the Young Women's Christian Association should convene an expanded women's compulsory education conference in the shortest possible time; this conference should have members from various social groups who are enthusiastic about women's education and female cadres with experience in women's education to participate; it can better give play to collective wisdom and accelerate the implementation of this work in a truly universal and in-depth way.</p>
<p>Second, according to what we have heard, many female workers in factories have written letters to the Women's Federation asking them to set up night schools for them; these female workers are mostly members who have participated in the "March 8th" commemoration conference. They are very satisfied with the Women's Federation's resolution on expanding compulsory education for women and are eager for the early realization of this resolution. Therefore, we believe that the Young Women's Christian Association should immediately accept the demands of these female workers first, and at the very least, immediately set up several free night schools in various districts.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that we should not limit this work to running night schools only, but should expand the scope of its work as much as possible to include newspapers, literacy, patriotic songs, drama, and even the establishment of libraries and the study of women's movement issues... Only in this way can the work be carried out on a broader scale. At the same time, there should be such determination and plans - to expand fundraising, expand organization, and continue the work for a long time.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of teachers, we believe that there should be careful selection and training; we should call on enthusiastic cadres from various schools and social groups to give a general basic understanding of the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country, and to give full play to their greatest spirit of service, without taking salaries; so that we can create the greatest work achievements with the least material conditions.</p>
<p>Sisters! Do not hesitate and delay any longer, remember that "whether the completion of ××'s nation-building work or not, the mobilization of the vast women's power, which accounts for half of the national population, is decisive!"</p>

<p>A bomb that can accommodate a driver inside has now been designed. This bomb is dropped from an altitude of 10,000 feet, controlled by the driver lying inside the bomb, causing it to glide to a position directly above the target object about 3,500 feet away, and then let it fall straight down, making it easy to hit. What about the driver? He has a parachute on his back, ready to detach from the bomb and land safely before he reaches his destination. To avoid the danger of landing in enemy camps, this bomb can now only be used for naval warfare. Therefore, a portable rubber boat and sufficient food are specially prepared for him so that he can drift on the water after landing to await rescue. It is said that this bomb can sink a battleship worth 20 million gold pounds, while the driver himself can ride in a small boat and return victoriously.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Rambling on Food <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Xinqiu</p>
<p>The structure and function of the human body are very much like a sophisticated and complex machine. Humans need to take in food, just like machines need to add coal. However, the food we take in, some increase heat, some compensate for physique, and some are stored for future use, which is very complicated. The general characteristics of animals are often determined by heredity, but the food they take in is also of great importance. If a person can usually only grow to a height of five feet eight inches, no specially made food can make him exceed this number. Conversely, if the food is not nutritious enough, this person will not be able to reach a height of five feet eight inches.</p>
<p>On average, each person consumes about 50 tons of food in their lifetime. It takes 70 pounds of food to grow one pound of flesh on the body. We absorb about 3,000 calories of heat every day. Healthy people convert 30 to 40% of these "heat energy" into "kinetic energy." In addition to transforming it into energy or storing it, some of the food consumed by humans is discarded outside the body because digestion and absorption are not perfect. Therefore, on the one hand, we should pay attention to its nutritional value, and at the same time, whether digestion and absorption can be fully carried out is an important matter.</p>
<p>The necessary food raw materials for humans can usually be divided into four categories: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Carbohydrates often become flour and sugar. Their main function is to generate energy. In metabolism, they and fat can interact to some extent. In healthy people, roughly 40 to 50% of the energy of the total food comes from carbohydrates, and 30 to 35% comes from fat. Fat often forms a protective layer around the nerves, it is the cushion of the nerves. Lack of fat in the human body will certainly make it easy to become weak and sick, and at the same time, it cannot obtain an appropriate amount of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, F, etc., which has a great impact on physiology. Protein is the element that forms the basic protoplasm of cell life. Its molecules are very complex, but only a few chemical elements are included in its organization. Most proteins contain about 51 to 55% carbon, 7% hydrogen, 32.0 to 23% oxygen, 15 to 2% sulfur, and some even contain a small amount of phosphorus or iron. Plants can compose amino acids to form life-sustaining proteins, so most of the protein needed by animals is taken from plants. Pure carbohydrates and proteins generate about four calories of heat per gram when oxidized in the body, while animal or vegetable fats generate nine calories of heat. Water only constitutes most of the weight of food, and it does not generate any energy. The chemical composition of various human foods can represent the cross-section of various substances on the earth. Not only are various elements present in food, but they also form a way that makes it easy for the human body to absorb. If the body lacks iron, it cannot directly eat iron ore to compensate for this deficiency, because these elements must wait until they have undergone a special composition before the body can absorb and utilize them.</p>
<p>It has now been proven that the condition for individual health requires at least 50% minerals. According to this standard, the average adult must obtain 0.68 grams of calcium per day. Calcium is very important for the preservation of teeth and bones, and phosphorus is equally important. Iron is an element of blood. The index of anemia is determined according to the content of hemoglobin. About 3% of the blood cells in the human body are constantly being destroyed there. If there is no iron to compensate, the number of blood cells will be abnormal and anemia will occur. It can be seen that minerals in food are also a major element in physiology.</p>
<p>Usually, the degree of digestion of food is often higher for mixed foods than for simple ones. The purpose of cooking food is to shorten the digestion time and make it easier to absorb. The time it takes to pass through the entire digestive tract is in the range of 12 to 47 hours. Excess or deficiency are both abnormal phenomena. The most important thing to pay attention to when cooking vegetables is the amount of water used, so as to avoid the loss of minerals and vitamin C.</p>
<p>Life relies on food to maintain life, and health is enhanced by various nutrients. The close relationship between food and the body is really worthy of attention.</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Conspiracy of the × Traitors and the Task of the People <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The art of war says: "In using the military, victory is prized. If operations are protracted, the soldiers' edge will be blunted and their ardor dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. If the army is exposed to long campaigns, the resources of the State will not be adequate. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor dampened, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your plight. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue." How could the Japanese invaders not know this reason? Since the twenty-third month of the war of aggression, especially after the recent major defeats on the border of Hubei and Henan and the major defeats in western and southern Shanxi, has the Japanese × not completely exposed its dull soldiers, blunted edges, exhausted strength, depleted goods, and isolated international position, and chaotic domestic situation? However, the Japanese × at the same time cannot but admit that the isolation of the Japanese ×'s international position, the seriousness of the domestic situation, and the determination of our united resistance are not only their chances of "quick victory and quick decision" have failed, but also the fantasy of "quick peace and quick conclusion" using Wang Jingwei's betrayal that followed was shattered! What other way do they have to solve their current increasingly difficult difficulties and crises? They stole the essence of our country's military tactics of "soldiers are not conscripted again, and supplies are taken from the country; grain is not transported for three years, and supplies are taken from the enemy" and adopted the conspiracy of "supporting the war with war," that is, using the human and material resources of our occupied areas to support its war of aggression. The specific contents are nothing more than:</p>
<p>First, instruct traitors in various places to establish small-unit puppet regimes as tools to consolidate the occupied areas:</p>
<p>Second, in the rear of the × puppet army, implement the so-called "appeasement" policy, using a little favor to buy people's hearts and drive them, while at the same time carrying out various absurd propaganda to our compatriots in the occupied areas, saying that our anti-Japanese parties have split and the anti-Japanese forces have been destroyed, and re-shaking the belief of our compatriots in the occupied areas in the victory of the war of resistance;</p>
<p>Third, carry out cruel exploitation and plunder in an attempt to squeeze the blood and sweat of our compatriots in the occupied areas to supplement their financial exhaustion;</p>
<p>Fourth, step up efforts to help Wang Jingwei and others promote the propaganda and agitation movement of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China," sow discord and division in our internal unity, slander our authorities and leaders from all walks of life, and attempt to divide and eliminate our country's resistance forces;</p>
<p>Fifth, risk pushing forward the anti-British movement in an attempt to plunder all the rights and interests of Britain and France in China, and at the same time blackmail and deceive Britain in an attempt to jointly force our country to submit.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this new conspiracy of Japanese × traitors will also encounter failure. However, the severity and speed of our failure depends on whether our countermeasures to combat this conspiracy are appropriate and sufficient. First of all, we must have a full understanding of the specific circumstances of the Japanese × traitors implementing this conspiracy. What arrangements do they have? What impact has it had? What is the basis of these influences on social institutions and past political situations? Secondly, we must clearly understand what the anti-Japanese forces behind the enemy, especially in the occupied areas, are like? What difficulties do many groups and cadres and individuals doing salvation work have in the political and military aspects that must be helped? What undesirable phenomena should be strictly corrected? What statements and behaviors are easily directly or indirectly used by Japanese × traitors? And what kind of clear-cut handling methods should be adopted? What are the advantages and strengths that should be promoted selflessly, so that the whole country can learn from them and strive for the final victory together?</p>
<p>"Politics is more important than military affairs" "The people are more important than soldiers," especially "the battle behind the enemy's army is more important than the front line." This is the characteristic of the second phase of the War of Resistance that the leader has revealed to the whole country. Whether we can successfully enter the counter-offensive stage, whether we can exhaust the enemy's power to the point where they cannot sustain it in the current situation, on the one hand, depends on how our new forces are cultivated, and at the same time, it depends on whether we can make our human and material resources in the occupied areas not be used by the enemy, but instead become a disaster for the enemy; it depends on whether we can consolidate unity, persist in the war of resistance, oppose shaking and conservatism, increase international sympathy and assistance; that is, it depends on whether we can break the conspiracy of the Japanese × traitors.</p>
<p>We know the ferocity and brutality of the Japanese × traitors, but we do not pay attention to their sinister schemes and vicious plans, which is very insufficient and quite dangerous; we only know that the compatriots behind the enemy are also like the compatriots in other places, hating the enemy and resisting the enemy, but we do not pay attention to the difficulties and dangers of their battle and the hardship of their lives, and we do not try to help them, which is even more insufficient and extremely dangerous. We compatriots in the "safe zone" must know more about the above situation, study these situations, and make more efforts to improve, in order to crush the conspiracy of the Japanese × traitors today.</p>
<h3 id="e7">500,000 Young Men and Women Serving the Country in the Rear, Engaged in Propaganda and Rescue Work, Enthusiastic and Working Intensely <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Xishan</p>
<p>Seeking National Liberation Through Hard Work</p>
<p>(A dispatch from a certain place) In the nineteen months since the July 7th Incident, what has made Chinese youth feel most honored is the victory in the work of saving the country. This has not only won the sympathy of people across the country, but also won the praise of people all over the world. Since the beginning of China's all-out war of resistance, Chinese youth have indeed done a lot of practical work to save the country. These more than 500,000 young men and women scattered in various regions of the interior, from any aspect, their spirit is sufficient to express their enthusiasm for the country.</p>
<p>In fact, under this all-out war of resistance, every two young people have felt the importance of their responsibilities. They can no longer bear to sit in the classroom, driven by passionate emotions. So they left school. A part of the young people bravely ran to the front line. They joined the formal army or formed small units of guerrillas to engage in direct anti-Japanese work. The best examples are the young college students from Tianjin and Beiping. Most of the young men and women, although they are not fighting on the front line, are very busy serving in the rear.</p>
<p>In Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Xi'an and many other areas, much of the political propaganda work, the rescue work of wounded soldiers, and the work of accommodating refugees are now entirely undertaken by young people. What is most admirable is the young people from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They used to live a very comfortable life in Shanghai, a large city, but today they are serving in the interior. Not only do they not feel uncomfortable with life, but their spirit of service is even better than others.</p>
<p>What we should mention is the efforts of young women to participate in the war of resistance. In many hospitals in the interior, female students are responsible for caring for the wounded soldiers. The best phenomenon is that they treat the wounded soldiers as their own brothers. They talk to them, comfort them, write letters home, sing songs, and read war news to them. They have a slogan that says, "Reducing the suffering of wounded soldiers and restoring the health of wounded soldiers is our first responsibility!"</p>
<p>Many young women are also receiving military training. They put on uniforms, cut their hair short, and when the sun rises, they are already lined up with guns on their backs, practicing in the square.</p>
<p>In every university or middle school in ××, there are at least eight hours of military subjects per week. Their daily life is completely militarized. Going to class, eating meals, getting up, and doing exercises are all carried out under the same discipline. In the suburbs, there are often teams of young student troops conducting field exercises. Agile and accurate movements symbolize that everyone is a brave warrior of the future.</p>
<p>In terms of propaganda work, they are expanding it. At the same time, many professors from schools are also helping to participate. Their highest goal is to improve the knowledge of the general public in order to strengthen and consolidate the public's patriotic sentiments. They have decided on four guidelines to promote this work: (1) Teach the illiterate masses to write and read. (2) Enlighten the public's thoughts on saving the country. (3) Train farmers to improve cultivation and handicraft production. (4) Train people how to organize themselves to resist aggression. Under this plan, many young people are engaged in various different ways to achieve this goal. They divide into teams and districts and go to various villages and cities, organizing drama and song and dance troupes, performing patriotic dramas in various places, and teaching the public to sing patriotic songs. Liu Liangmo, a composer of popular songs, led many young men and women to work in various places in Changsha. These means of reality propaganda containing high consciousness have awakened the public's will to resist the war.</p>
<p>Many college students in Chengdu organized rural service groups and used their vacations to work in nearby rural areas. They established temporary schools and people's night schools, gathered nearby farmers to study, and set up mobile libraries and traveling lecture groups, explaining wartime knowledge such as air defense, poison gas, and first aid. In the summer of last year, students from various universities in Chongqing, including Fudan University, successively organized economic investigation groups to various provinces (also joining economic investigation groups organized by the authorities). The inspections to Guiyang and various provinces in the southwest have all achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>At the Northwest Anti-Japanese University, many young men and women are training in difficult living conditions. The graduates of each session are assigned to lead important anti-Japanese work in various places, totaling five or six thousand people.</p>
<p>Secondly, in ××, under the leadership of Ms. Soong Mei-ling, hundreds of young women are also being trained. They will also shoulder special rear work.</p>
<p>In summary, in the past year or so, Chinese youth have been working hard and successfully in the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. Every young person serving in the interior is not only enthusiastic, but also working hard in practice. There are no individuals among them, but they care for the group with each other. Under the arduous struggle, they hope to open up a new path and seek true national liberation!</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 20th] The Japanese military authorities have lodged a serious protest with the British naval authorities, stating that on the 6th of this month, the British warship HMS Saint Gothard attempted to unload cargo at Wuhu without notifying the Japanese military beforehand of the type and quantity of the cargo. The authorities only stopped the operation after Japanese military intervention. On the 14th, the British warship repeatedly attempted to do so again. Japanese military officers and soldiers intended to stop it, but were prevented from interfering by British machine guns. The protest letter further stated that these actions violated the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of June 3rd. According to the agreement, which has not been previously published, any British warship intending to unload cargo ashore in areas along the Yangtze River must first notify the Japanese military authorities of the type and quantity of the cargo.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] According to well-informed sources here, before Wang Jingwei went to Japan, he consulted with Chen Zhongfu and others in Shanghai on ways to resolve the current situation. He asked to be responsible for negotiating peace with the enemy government. The content of the solution: (1) Request the enemy to abolish the North and South puppet organizations and assist him in establishing a unified puppet organization. (2) Request the enemy to provide 3 million yuan per month for peace activities. Zhao Shuyong was previously sent to Ping with a letter to see Wang Kemin, and another person was sent to Nanjing to see Liang Hongzhi, but the results of the discussions were not very satisfactory. Recently, he again instructed Chen Zhongfu to go north with a Mr. He in an attempt to encourage Wu Peifu to join the rebellion. Wu expressed considerable indifference. Furthermore, Wang recently sent Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and others to conduct various activities in Shanghai, using enemy force and money, using methods such as coercion and bribery, to win over the press and cultural circles, but anyone with a little integrity ignored them. Wang himself went to Japan at the beginning of the month with Gao Zongwu to meet with the enemy chieftains, and is currently staying in Tokyo, waiting for news from Chen Zhongfu and others before returning to Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] Foreign news from Shanghai: According to business sources, between January and April of this year, China exported tea worth 500,000 British pounds to the Soviet Union, totaling 9,000 tons, accounting for 86% of all tea exports. It is said that the tea exported to the Soviet Union and the tung oil exported to the United States were both "bartered for goods." It is recalled that several months ago, the United States used tung oil exports as collateral to lend money to the Chinese. It is generally believed that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the export of the above-mentioned products has increased over the past year.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Military Affairs Commission Strictly Orders All Levels of Government to Respect Public Opinion, Protect Lives, Use Labor Cautiously, and Save Money <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Strive to Convey Public Sentiment Upwards and Shatter Enemy Conspiracy</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin by this newspaper, 20th] The War Zone Command of the Military Affairs Commission issued an order to all Pacification Headquarters, which was then forwarded to all levels of military and political organs, instructing them to respect public opinion, protect lives, use labor cautiously, and save money. The telegram stated, "This war of resistance against Japan is purely for the sake of the independence and survival of the nation and the race. Now that the war of resistance has lasted for more than twenty months, the public has always warmly supported the national policy of resisting to the end, which fully demonstrates that the launch of the war of resistance is in line with the requirements of public opinion. However, 'reward those who cherish me, and hate those who abuse me' is the most common psychology of human beings. All levels of civil and military officials should absolutely respect public opinion, so that the feelings of the people can be conveyed upwards. When intentions are conveyed, emotions will arise, thereby inspiring their patriotic enthusiasm, strengthening their centripetal force, and making them enthusiastically contribute their wealth and labor, and even dedicate their lives, for the benefit of the country. We should also respect lives and use labor cautiously, so as to obtain the guarantee of final victory. The victory or defeat of the war of resistance depends entirely on the continued support of lives, labor, and wealth, the length of time, and the amount of supply. All use of labor and wealth, or sacrifice of lives, must be reduced to the minimum extent possible during times of necessity. If it is unavoidable to sacrifice lives, the people will die without complaint; if labor and wealth are used within the minimum limit, there will be more than enough even if used. The violent enemy is currently destroying labor and extorting wealth in the occupied areas on the one hand, and attempting to win over and unite the hearts of the people on the other. Both are being carried out simultaneously, with all kinds of fraud and deceit. We should especially adhere to the above-mentioned principles, and provide comfort to the people in the war of resistance in every possible way, so that they will not be shaken by them. Only then can the belief that the war of resistance will surely succeed be thoroughly realized. In addition to separate orders, this order is to be strictly followed. And forward to the integral subordination for the must be followed" and other words.</p>
<h3 id="e18">The United States Adopts a Tough Stance Towards Japan; US Agent Lodges Two Protests with Japan; Japan Deeply Fears the US Will Publicize the Details of the Negotiations; Hiranuma, Arita, and Itagaki Hold Emergency Meetings <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] Foreign news from Tokyo: It is reported that the US government has now adopted a tough attitude towards various Far East issues that are not directly related to the Tianjin incident. This attitude will also affect the Tianjin matter. US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan Grew lodged two strong protests with the Japanese government last night: one protesting the arbitrary bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft, and the other protesting the Japanese ban on the transport of food to Gulangyu. Regarding the bombing of American property, Grew first stated each instance of the bombing of American property, one by one. Next, he pointed out that the Japanese government had made a guarantee to the United States that it would no longer bomb American property, but it has not fulfilled its promise to date. Finally, Grew stated that if the Japanese side does not immediately stop the bombing, the United States will immediately publish all the details of the US-Japan negotiations. As for the protest against the Japanese military's blockade of Gulangyu, the US note expressed surprise at the Japanese actions. It is reported that the US attitude towards the Tianjin incident has not been lenient, but it has put pressure on Japan regarding other issues, which may affect the resolution of the Tianjin incident in the future. After the Japanese government received the US note, Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki discussed the matter. It is reported that the Japanese side deeply fears that the United States will publish the details of the US-Japan negotiations, because the result will affect US public opinion and support Britain's position on the Tianjin incident.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan Grew visited Japanese Foreign Ministry's American Bureau Director Yosizawa yesterday to discuss the Tianjin incident. According to local newspapers, the two diplomats also discussed the issue of the United States acting as a mediator, but the newspapers also stated that the Japanese government will definitely reject this proposal, as the Tianjin incident is only a matter between Britain and Japan and has nothing to do with third countries, and the only solution is for Britain to provide a guarantee to completely abandon its "anti-Japanese" attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Special Correspondent's Report: Travel Notes on Mount Luofu (7) <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Liuying</p>
<p>We gathered with the telegraph squad and staff officers and advanced towards the north of Mount Luofu. Along the way, enemy planes kept circling above us. At first, we were afraid that the enemy planes would spot our target because there were too many people. After walking three or four miles, we were in a deep and densely forested area. The sounds of artillery and bombs accompanied us all the way. Along the way, refugees asked us for news, concerned about their homes, their fields, their lives, and their property, frowning and angry at the flames of war.</p>
<p>At this time, Chen's regiment had already moved from Futian to the southeast of Mount Luofu, Wei's regiment had moved from the east of Mount Luofu towards the north, and the mass salvation workers, the Zengcheng guerrillas, and the Third Guerrilla District's XX Brigade were all approaching Mount Luofu from different directions. In short, all forces were concentrated on Mount Luofu. The northwest sides were filled with the clear sounds of artillery and machine guns.</p>
<p>Looking into the Distance at Hulu Hun</p>
<p>We climbed Mount Luofu layer by layer. The road became narrower and smaller, and more rugged, and higher above the horizon. At first, looking up, the gray clouds swallowed the entire mountain peak, but when we reached one peak, there was another peak above it, swallowed by the clouds.</p>
<p>Enemy planes slipped through the gaps in the clouds, leveling with us. Walking and walking again, we climbed another mountain peak, and it started pouring rain. The rain was so heavy, but the enemy planes were flying crazily, circling constantly to our left and behind. However, their altitude had already been placed under our feet. I felt my own greatness and nobility. The sounds of artillery and bombs, and the sounds of the rain and the pine waves, merged into one.</p>
<p>We reached another mountain peak and the rain stopped. Looking back, we saw the milky white Dongjiang River lying horizontally at the foot of Mount Luofu, and looking north, it was full of artillery fire, full of the combined forces of our nation's resistance and the villages. Over there, in a distant valley, was a cluster of small trees, with the corners of houses faintly visible within the trees. Liu Kechang was staring at it in a daze. "That is Hulu Hun, the home of Gan Guquan, the former Village Chief, Rui Cong," he told us, pointing.</p>
<p>When we heard the three words "Hulu Hun," we were all filled with awe and stopped in our tracks, staring in that direction, asking each other questions and talking about Lai Ruicong's glorious history of resistance.</p>
<p>That village, hidden in the mountains and growing on the branches of Mount Luofu, seemed very small, with a total of less than two hundred people. However, in the great cause of resistance, it had established an incomparably great achievement. Under the leadership of the village chief Lai, the villagers, young and old, male and female, had launched ten attacks against the enemy, and the ashes of the invaders had been packaged into more than thirty bags and sent back by this small village. Later, the enemy soldiers had no choice but to bow their heads to this village, but this vital force of the nation was tightly entangled with them. So one time, a large number of traitors led more than five hundred enemy troops to specifically attack this village, and the village chief Lai also sacrificed himself in this attack. Therefore, another glorious page was written in the history of the resistance in Boluo.</p>
<p>This small village played such a big role, which shows that our mobilization work is not enough. The progress of politics is not keeping up with the military, and at the same time, it reflects the inadequacy of the Baojia system. If all the villages were like Hulu Village, and all the village chiefs were like Lai, no matter how fierce the enemy was, they would not be able to run rampant. I remembered our eulogy for Village Chief Lai: "If all the village chiefs were like you, the enemy would not be afraid. If all the villagers rise up, the spirit will not die and the hero will be comforted."</p>
<p>A Female Comrade Sacrificed</p>
<p>We were already forty miles away from the front line - we had reached a place just six miles from Sulao, where a waterfall cut off our path. This mountain torrent was pouring down from the top of Mount Luofu, and the water was rushing down like a mountain collapsing. The trees in the mountain stream were swaying, and although the water was only two or three feet deep, the majestic force could not but make us hesitate. So we spent a lot of energy and time considering this mountain stream, which was only six feet wide. The rain was pouring down constantly, and there were no villages to stay in if we retreated, and it was impossible for this mountain stream to recede in a short time. So I and comrades Chen and Liu became an exploration team. We climbed upstream by clinging to vines, exploring the path. We climbed like mice for less than two zhang and found trees crossing the two banks. We made a signal - because the impact of the water and the sound of the rain made it impossible for people only a few feet away to hear each other - and then climbed across the small tree that was stretched out, step by step. Our feet were skewed by the water,</p>
<p>We climbed to the hillside on the opposite bank and waved to them, and they did the same, one by one. Of course, everyone was soaked, and the raincoats had lost their effectiveness.</p>
<p>More than a dozen people had reached the "other shore." Over there, there were only three porters and the important items of the staff office, which could not be carried over. We asked the porters and Squad Leader Hu to wait here for the political training director of the Zengcheng Guerrilla, and to guard the public property. Because Director Liu Zhengxun was ill and had fallen behind, but Staff Officer Ruan and his wife were carrying him, along with a guard, probably one person. So we were relatively relieved. But it was precisely because we were "relieved" that it became "heartbreaking."</p>
<p>We passed through the alert line of Wei's regiment and Liang's battalion, and soon after arriving at the Sulao Temple, we received the news that a certain female comrade had sacrificed in that turbulent mountain stream, and her body could not be found. We were very sad. We understood that there was only one female comrade, which was the wife of Director Liu Zhengxun who followed him. For the nation, for her husband, she was swallowed by that turbulent mountain torrent. It was glorious, but we had to be more vigilant. All salvation workers must practice climbing mountains, crossing rivers, swimming, and climbing trees. Delicate young ladies must work harder to learn.</p>
<p>The Night Before Sulao Was Burned Down</p>
<p>We braved the heavy rain and passed through the cordon. The soldiers at the sentry post told us that enemy soldiers had been discovered at Duling Ao, ten miles away from Sulao. There was a possibility of being attacked immediately. At that time, we all felt a kind of luck. If the enemy had arrived at the same time as us, we would have been attacked on both sides, with the enemy on our left and our troops in front, and the result would have been terrible.</p>
<p>After circling around many low, mud houses attached to the mountainside fields, we arrived at Sulao Temple. It was already seven o'clock. The temple was already closed, and after much negotiation, we were able to enter. When we knocked on the door, a heavy response came from inside, and some opened the windows to look at our group of distinguished guests. At the same time, the dogs in the neighboring village also started barking.</p>
<p>Suliao Temple is the largest of the temples on Mount Luofu, with no less than a hundred Taoists inside. They are all men at least forty years old, each with a room. The right side is the guest room, and each room is very elegant and clean. Rather than a temple, it is more like a large hotel in the mountains. Because they are prepared to accommodate tourists, they charge different amounts of silver per person, and the meals are fixed at two cents per person. If it were a peaceful and prosperous time, many wealthy guests would come here to play in the summer. The Taoists also boasted about their coolness and cleanliness, welcoming the summer, but now it is different. No matter how quiet and elegant the place is, the enemy's artillery fire will come to visit.</p>
<p>After we arrived at Sulao Temple, the first lesson was to count the number of people, and the second was to take off our clothes, unpack our packages, and bake our clothes. In less than ten minutes, two charcoal stoves were lit, and everyone gathered around, and the charcoal smoke and the hot smell of wet cloth filled the whole room.</p>
<p>We were eating dinner, and artillery fire was heard from Duling. One comrade mistook it for a tree falling. No one from Battalion Commander Liang's side contacted us. We were still wondering whether there had been any changes in the enemy's situation. But we were sure that the enemy would not dare to invade Sulao at night, because the terrain was not conducive to their night march, and we also had many troops here.</p>
<p>Everyone was extremely tired. At ten o'clock, we were already sleeping quietly. The night was dark and terrifying.</p>
<p>"No trace of the enemy in Mazha, Chen's regiment XX battalion gathered in Lanshi,... Dozens of enemy plainclothes teams were found below Duling. The team is being searched. The situation in Futian is unknown... This battalion will not move tonight." This was the information Battalion Commander Liang gave us. It was already midnight when it was delivered, but everyone got up to take turns looking at it.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held another meeting this morning at 10 Downing Street, lasting an hour and a half, to further discuss the Far East situation caused by the blockade of Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, visited the British Foreign Office this evening to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for an hour. Afterwards, neither side would comment on the details of the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, "Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax expressed Britain's stance to Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu yesterday, stating that it is difficult to accept Japan's unreasonable and extensive demands regarding the recent situation in Tianjin. The Foreign Secretary specifically pointed out the incidents of British women being violated and British citizens being forcibly stripped and searched, expressing the British government's inability to tolerate such incidents." The report also stated, "Any unreasonable steps taken by the Japanese side will be met with protests from the British government. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain has clearly indicated that if the Tokyo central authorities genuinely intend to restrain the provocative actions of Japanese troops in Tianjin, then Britain is also unwilling to expand the tense region. Before implementing economic retaliation, Britain is still giving the Japanese side an opportunity to resolve the matter locally, but unfortunately, this opportunity has not affected Japan's xenophobic and provocative behavior."</p>
<p>Chamberlain's Report to the House of Commons: Still Hoping for a Local Resolution</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today on the Far East situation, stating, "The blockade of the Tianjin concession continues, and all British citizens entering and leaving are being detained and subjected to strict searches, some of which are insulting and infuriating." Perishable foods and ice, among other things, are being subjected to strict inspections when being transported into the concession, causing delays under various pretexts. However, the transport of these items is becoming increasingly urgent. It is reported that ordinary supplies can be transported to markets near the French concession, and for the time being, there seems to be no need for special measures. However, more reliable information is currently being gathered from the British authorities in Tianjin regarding the matter. Chamberlain then explained that on the morning of June 10, two British merchant ships sailed directly to Tianjin along the Hai River and were not subjected to inspection. However, in general, British tugboats and barges are being detained and inspected by the Japanese side. The British Consul-General in Tianjin has lodged a protest, and the British Ambassador to Japan has also been instructed to negotiate with the Japanese government. The overall situation is not yet clear, but in reality, since the Japanese side raised the broad issue of general policy, their previous request for the extradition of the four Chinese has been muddled. The Japanese government has not yet sent a formal note to Britain, and it is hoped that a local resolution will be possible this time. The Prime Minister continued, "The British Imperial Government believes that the Japanese government must also hope to avoid expanding the scope of the dispute, which would only make the difficult situation more acute. At the same time, the British government is paying close attention to the reactions of the current events to other British and public concessions within China. Lord Halifax will meet with the Japanese Ambassador today, and Sir Robert Craigie in Tokyo is also trying to clarify the situation there. We are maintaining the closest contact with the French and American governments." Chamberlain then responded to Labour MP Henderson, stating that the British proposal to extradite the four suspects is still ready to be implemented. Eden then questioned whether the government had clearly guaranteed to all relevant parties that food and energy would be supplied to the British citizens in Tianjin. Chamberlain replied, "Yes, we are currently conducting inquiries and are prepared to implement any necessary measures to ensure the supply of food." Finally, he responded to Labour MP Baker, stating that the blockade of Gulangyu has not been lifted either.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Under-Secretary of the Navy, Rear Admiral Wake Walker, reported to the House of Commons today that, given the draft of the Tianjin river, the largest British warship that can sail to Tianjin is HMS "Rosroyston," which is currently stationed in Tianjin. Therefore, under the current circumstances, considering sending other British warships, which are thirty miles from Tianjin, to Tianjin is useless. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler responded to Sörensen's suggestion that the Prime Minister should propose to U.S. President Roosevelt the organization of an international federation and a world parliament, saying, "Under the current circumstances, this suggestion does not seem appropriate." Labour MP Baring asked whether the British government had planned any special measures to ensure sufficient food supplies for the concessions in Tianjin and Gulangyu. Butler referred him to Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on the Tianjin issue and went on to say that the food situation in Gulangyu was not very serious, but the sources of firewood, meat, and vegetables were rather difficult. A food commission has been established in the Gulangyu concession, and it is hoped that food can be transported from other ports in Britain to provide assistance. Butler replied to Conservative MP Graham's question, "The British government denies that the Japanese have the right to arrest or detain British people under any circumstances. On this point, the Japanese government should have no doubt." In his question, Graham mentioned a statement by a Japanese spokesperson in Shanghai, stating that they reserve the right to impose punitive measures on any foreigners deemed to endanger the safety of Japanese troops in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Hull Issues Statement: Expressing Close Attention</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Hull today formally expressed that the United States is extremely concerned about all "broad developments" in the Tianjin incident. He said that the U.S. Consul in Tianjin had offered to mediate. The original text of Hull's statement is as follows: "The U.S. government is not concerned about the cause of the Tianjin problem, namely Japan's request for the extradition of the four suspected Chinese. What the U.S. government is concerned about is the subsequent events of broad significance and the developments in other parts of China. The U.S. government is now paying special attention to the developments in China that are related to the U.S. on a daily basis." Hull then discussed the U.S. offer to mediate, stating that the scope of mediation was limited to the extradition of the four Chinese and was proposed before the lifting of the Tianjin blockade. He continued that Washington has not drafted any plans to evacuate American women and children residing in Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Regarding Hull's statement, sources close to the State Department here said that its intention was to warn Japan that its strategy of alienating the United States from Britain and France would not succeed. This is because the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East are closely related. The Japanese spokesperson's attack on the concession system and the policies of Western countries in China, while Britain is bearing the brunt, the interests of the United States are also threatened and cannot be ignored. The U.S. government is still maintaining a detached attitude to facilitate mediation between Britain and Japan, although the hope that Japan will accept mediation is very slim. However, the State Department does not want to block the path to a peaceful resolution. Experienced observers said that the U.S. government's position in the Far East is very weak because Japan imports approximately three-quarters of its goods from the United States, and the cotton and other resources it needs are entirely purchased from the United States. Economic retaliation against Japan, if not joined by the United States, will have very little effect. If the United States participates, political figures fear that it will harm the country's peace. Most believe that the U.S. government should strive for a resolution between Britain and Japan and should only resort to economic pressure as a last resort. In addition, the impression that the United States advocated taking firm action at the beginning of the Manchurian Incident in 1931, but Britain did not agree to help, has not been forgotten by political figures. Therefore, there is no doubt about their suspicion of cooperation with the United States. Another group of people said that the Tianjin incident involves Britain and France more than the United States, and therefore, the United States should take a detached and observant attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 20th] U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement expressing concern about the broad developments in the Tianjin situation. The New York Times said, "The issuance of this statement is timely. The Japanese launched the Tianjin incident to directly challenge the entire structure of British interests in China. We also have treaties with China and should pay close attention to the methods and objectives of the Japanese attack, as well as its inherent significance."</p>
<p>British and American Media Continue to Demand Strong Action</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The Daily Mail said today, "Britain should not compromise with the instigators of the Tianjin incident. If Tokyo does not have the strength or will to stop these instigators, then we have no choice but to take active steps to protect our interests."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] The Daily Telegraph reported that Japan's actions in Tianjin have provoked British protests. The British government should make it clear that if the Japanese central government can effectively curb the illegal actions of the Japanese local authorities in Tianjin, then the British government is unwilling to expand the situation. Therefore, before implementing economic sanctions against Japan, Japan is given another opportunity to resolve the matter locally. However, to this day, the government has not shown any signs of persuading the Tianjin local authorities to implement suppression, and instead, the movement against Western expatriates has expanded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Today's Washington Star editorial stated that the situation caused by the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin affects the interests of the United States no differently than those of Britain and France, because the future of the economic interests of all countries in China depends on the outcome of this blockade. Tokyo clearly intends to use the Tianjin incident to settle accounts with democratic countries that oppose the "New Order in East Asia." Britain is now planning to take decisive measures to deal with it. It is difficult to say at this time to what extent the United States intends to support it. In short, the feelings of the American people regarding Japan's trampling of international rights in China have been expressed in public opinion polls. An increasing number of Americans advocate boycotting Japanese goods and banning the transport of military supplies to Japan. Furthermore, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew is currently here, and the U.S. government will surely be able to make wise decisions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Today, various newspapers here continue to publish Tianjin news and write special articles to comment on it. Tillman wrote in the News Chronicle, "The wealth of the British concession, such as docks, warehouses, and valuable trade, is the true goal of the Japanese warlords. Unless the British concession belongs to Japan, the Japanese cannot claim North China as part of the Japanese Empire." The Manchester Guardian's New York correspondent reported that the situation in China remains the focus of American public opinion. Americans believe that Japan's pressure on the British concession in Tianjin is aimed at dealing with all Caucasians in Asia. In recent months, the U.S. attitude towards Japan has become much tougher. According to a survey a year ago, most Americans did not approve of suspending trade relations with Japan. Now, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Roman Fascist Newspaper Heavily Reports on the Collapse of the Old Empire</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Italian newspapers mostly "downplay" the situation in the Far East. Among the newspapers in Rome, only Il Fascista heavily reports on the Tianjin news, publishing the eye-catching headline "The Old Empire Collapses" on the front page.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] The Deutsche Zeitung discusses the British-Japanese dispute in Tianjin, while also mentioning the Danzig issue in the same breath, stating, "Moscow has gained the upper hand. Although Britain wants to turn the Tianjin dispute into a local event, the Soviet Union is linking it to the European convention issue, making it the center of international politics. Moscow is confident that once Britain has a disagreement, it can be manipulated by the Soviet Union in the European part. Ask, among British people, who has ever thought that they must fight for Danzig or Tianjin?"</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] Today, German newspapers republished an authorized statement strongly denying the troop movements of German troops in Slovakia, Bohemia, and Moravia, as well as claims of German-Hungarian intentions to divide Slovakia. The statement said that, according to authoritative sources, the publication of such absurd rumors in foreign newspapers is clearly a meticulously considered plan to suit the basic work of the encirclement policy. In addition, the German government had previously summoned 25,000 students to help with rural harvest work, and now members of the Hitler Youth are also being summoned to participate in this work.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 20th] On Monday (19th), the U.S. Senate's "Committee on Improving Labor-Management Relations" released a report stating that since 1933, the United States has suffered losses of no less than 7,000,000,000 yuan due to strikes and other labor disputes. If this situation is allowed to drag on, the American democratic system will soon be in danger of collapse.

<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee continued to meet at 10 Downing Street this morning. It is reported that the British-Soviet negotiations currently underway in Moscow were also discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] It is rumored that the talks between Strang and Molotov yesterday included the Far East issue, but officials here declared today that this statement is absolutely inaccurate, and pointed out that the British-Soviet negotiations are purely based on European issues.</p>
<p>[London 20th Radio Broadcast Message] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday, "British-Soviet negotiations are still underway in Moscow. Last Thursday afternoon, the British and French Ambassadors to the Soviet Union, along with Strang, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, visited Molotov. British Ambassador Seeds explained the latest British and French proposals to Mr. Molotov. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Molotov met with the British and French representatives again and put forward some of the Soviet Union's views on the British and French proposals." Mr. Chamberlain then stated that the main differences between Britain and the Soviet Union were not limited to the status of the Baltic states. A member asked, "Are the instructions granted to Seeds by the British government broad enough to make it unnecessary for Seeds to seek instructions from London again?" He replied, "This must be determined based on the situation of the negotiations. New focal points may arise during the negotiation process, thus requiring instructions, but I do not know of any new focal points at present."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The News Chronicle said, "The government must know that under these circumstances, the British-Soviet agreement must be concluded as soon as possible. Prime Minister Chamberlain reiterated in the House of Commons yesterday that British-Soviet negotiations are still in progress, and the time for success is not far away."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] This morning, the newspapers here did not explain the reason for the sudden postponement of the British-Soviet negotiations, which were originally scheduled to be held yesterday. The Daily Telegraph denied that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds had received new instructions from the British government, and said that rumors that the Latvian Ambassador to Britain had met with the Head of the Eastern European Department of the Foreign Office yesterday, and that this was related to the British-Soviet negotiations, were also inaccurate. However, the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Express said that the British Embassy in the Soviet Union did receive new instructions from the government, the content of which was to suggest accepting the Soviet Union's request to guarantee the Baltic states. The report also said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations in the House of Commons at the end of the week.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] Since the return of German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Count Schulenburg to Berlin, rumors about German-Soviet negotiations have been rampant.

<h3 id="e28">Respect Public Opinion <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Today's report from Guilin in this newspaper stated that the Military Affairs Commission issued a general order to all civil and military officials across the country to respect public opinion, public lives, and use public resources and finances with caution. This is truly a very important order! Originally, since the War of Resistance, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the wise central government, China's politics have made leaps and bounds. The government has repeatedly ordered that public opinion be respected and civil governance be promoted, and the people's support for the government and national unity has presented an unprecedentedly good atmosphere! However, there are still some localities that have not yet understood or faithfully implemented this, and Wang Jingwei and a small number of traitorous and backward elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord, doing all kinds of evil. This kind of countercurrent is naturally beneficial to × and harmful to the cause of resistance and national construction. The current general order from the Central Military Affairs Commission is a major blow to × people and traitors! We, the people, should further interpret it widely, persuade and encourage each other, redouble our efforts, support the government, and revive the nation.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Finland, Helsinki, 20th] The local "Uusi Suomi" newspaper published an "Extra" edition on Monday afternoon, stating that General Mannerheim, Chairman of the National Defense Council, had submitted his resignation to Finnish Prime Minister A. K. Cajander. When asked if this statement was reliable, Mr. Cajander replied that he had not received Mr. Mannerheim's resignation. The Finnish official news agency had not yet been able to obtain confirmation of the news by Monday evening, as all cabinet members were resting outside the capital. However, political circles still believe that Mr. Mannerheim has indeed resigned, and the reason for his resignation may be related to the Åland Islands issue. It is noteworthy that Mr. Mannerheim had invited British "Home Forces Inspector General" Lieutenant-General Sir Robert H. Haining to dinner on Monday, and Sir Robert had just arrived in the Finnish capital from the Swedish capital on Sunday. Upon his arrival, Finnish Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko and various army generals welcomed Sir Robert. After unpacking, Sir Robert formally visited various Finnish authorities, attended Foreign Minister Erkko's banquet on Sunday evening, and inspected various equipment of the Finnish Defense Forces on Monday.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Account of a Duel with Little Mussolini <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Blood Splattered Across the Sky</p>
<p>September 28, 1937. American volunteer in the Spanish government forces, Mr. Trick Dickinson, engaged in an aerial duel with Bruno Mussolini, the eldest son of Mussolini. The following is Dickinson's report.</p>
<p>I fought in Spain for a total of sixteen months. In the autumn of 1937, I was the leader of the "Red Wing" squadron in Gastron. At that time, Little Mussolini also commanded a squadron of the Nationalist Air Force, stationed in Palma, facing us from afar.</p>
<p>It was at the end of August, one evening, I learned from Colonel Reyes, my superior, that Little Mussolini had broadcast on the Nationalist radio, challenging five government aircraft to a duel. Perhaps this was Little Mussolini's way of boosting morale. Unexpectedly, the duel finally took place.</p>
<p>I immediately sent a telegram, volunteering to fight Little Mussolini alone. Later, I sent another telegram urging him. Finally, ten days later, I received his reply:</p>
<p>"I accept Captain Dickinson's proposal. The single combat is set for noon on September 28th, at the center of the battlefield between the two armies, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Each side will bring two reconnaissance aircraft. Absolutely no participation in the battle is allowed. After the two sides meet, they will perform a loop to indicate the start of the battle. When one side admits defeat, they can tie their gloves to a long scarf and throw it out. Please agree to abide by all the above points. Bruno Mussolini."</p>
<p>After that, I did not make any special preparations. My plane was a Soviet Boeing, with 1,050 horsepower, equipped with four twin-barreled Vickers machine guns, and two electrically controlled machine guns on the wings.</p>
<p>That day arrived. Four comrades departed first in two reconnaissance planes. A quarter of an hour later, I also bravely advanced towards Palma.</p>
<p>It was noon. Four reconnaissance planes were circling above me. In the direction of the Nationalist forces, a black dot appeared. That was Little Mussolini, coming in a 1,300-horsepower monoplane.</p>
<p>We simultaneously flew in a large circle and then inverted once, and then the close combat began. What I saw were sparks from the enemy's machine guns, what I heard was the shriek of bullets passing by my ears, and what I felt on my body was the vibration of bullets hitting the wings. We charged at each other, engaging at close quarters, only inches apart.</p>
<p>The two planes separated, followed by semi-circular rolls, at extremely close range. I could clearly make out all the features on Mussolini's face. I took a breath, turned my plane, and charged into battle again.</p>
<p>The next fifteen minutes were even more intense, because the various maneuvers were too fast, and I could hardly remember them clearly. But I felt that whatever maneuver he did, I must do the same or better. The enemy plane had 250 more horsepower than mine, so speed helped him a lot.</p>
<p>My plane was shaking very badly. Soviet planes could not be overloaded with excessive weight and horsepower, which greatly affected my aim.</p>
<p>Ascending, descending, circling, rolling – these were continuous movements in a matter of seconds. The speed of the movement caused the blood in my limbs to stagnate, and the air hit my body with unrelenting force. The sound of the engine and machine guns numbed my brain, until I lost my hearing.</p>
<p>In my experience, I had never been the target of so many bullets.</p>
<p>We were descending – 14,000 feet, 11,000, 8,000... Our reconnaissance planes were also circling, watching.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I discovered a wound on my left arm, and blood was spurting out. I immediately descended, which was actually a mistake, because Mussolini was right behind me, pouring lead bullets into me!</p>
<p>I tried my best to balance myself, stopping the engine's forward motion, and side-slipped. When the enemy plane rushed past, I delivered a blow. This time, I saw that I hit him, because his plane swayed. Afterwards, I heard that his leg was injured – although we had no way to confirm it – I think he was hit by a bullet at this time. But within a second, he was back.</p>
<p>5,000 feet, 4,000, 3,000. Eighteen minutes, twenty minutes, we continued to fight hand-to-hand. At that time, I was hungry and exhausted. Bullets broke my instruments, and glass hit my face. I thought I was going to fail. But I seized the last opportunity, and untied my scarf at the same time.</p>
<p>I pretended to circle, turning to the top. At that time, I was a huge target for him. I reduced myself to the smallest possible position, anticipating that lead bullets would shatter my body, but nothing happened. When I finished turning, I got the opportunity. The enemy plane was such a big target for my machine guns, it felt like a house. My heart was beating even harder, and my fingers began to tighten on the machine guns, firing a fierce burst. Then I saw his hand raise, and a black object was thrown from his plane, unfurling a long white tail – a scarf and gloves!</p>
<p>I was relieved that he didn't know I was almost going to do the same thing as him.</p>
<p>As I leveled off, I saw him waving, tilting his plane forward, as a sign of respect. Then we parted ways and went back.</p>
<p>In the 22-minute aerial battle, my plane had 326 bullet holes. I was lucky to have only suffered one arm injury. After that, Bruno Mussolini was no longer the captain of the Palma Air Force.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Weather Forecast <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the police announced the results of their investigation: From May 28th to June 15th, there were twelve robbery cases in three weeks – not counting theft cases, of course – involving sixty-seven thieves, resulting in nineteen deaths and injuries, and a loss of over three thousand yuan. (Space) However, compared to the previous period, the number has already decreased, presumably due to the hot weather and the effectiveness of the anti-crime efforts.</p>
<p>It is said that in Hong Kong, when buying chickens and ducks, one must carry them in one's arms and is not allowed to carry them by the feet, because that is animal cruelty.</p>
<p>According to newspaper reports, there are now people criticizing explorers for capturing pandas, considering it a cruel act. Excellent, excellent.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to make a suggestion to support the protection of livestock. That is, please, people in Hong Kong, simply don't eat beef, don't eat chickens and ducks, and certainly don't eat cats.</p>
<p>Everyone knows how numerous, fierce, and ruthless the rats in Hong Kong are. Regarding this, one gentleman put forward a reason, saying: There are already very few cats here. As a result, they are still cooked into "Dragon Tiger Fight" and used by gentlemen to fill their stomachs. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer cats, and more and more rats, which are becoming more and more rampant and uncontrollable. Whether this statement is true is unknown; I will just say it for what it's worth, and record it for what it's worth.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Ghost <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Four people were chatting late at night in an old house. Suddenly, they started talking about ghosts. One person said: It is said that a ghost's chin is soft. So, everyone made a commotion, joking around and touching each other's chins. The youngest of them blushed and refused to let anyone touch him. Of course, they were even more determined to touch him. But when they touched his chin, it was as soft as cotton. The three were greatly frightened and rushed out of the door. They only heard many people laughing heartily in the room.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Statistics <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Do you know the losses of the last war? Here are some statistics for you. Human casualties: 10,000,000 people killed in action; 4,000,000 people "missing" – a euphemism for death without burial; 6,500,000 people seriously injured; 14,000,000 people slightly injured.</p>
<p>The material destruction of the war reached $40,000,000,000,000. If the United States' war expenses were distributed, every family in the United States could build a $5,000 house and buy a $500 piece of land. In addition, they would still have $1,000 left over to use as they pleased.</p>

<h3 id="e38">After Adjustment of Exchange Rate, Export of Domestic Goods Is Expected to Increase Sharply. Successful Management of Southwest Customs Leads to Trade Surplus. Trade Deficit of Shanghai and Tianjin Customs May Be Reduced Hereafter. <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Astonishing Value of Imported Foreign Goods</p>
<p>In terms of imported foreign goods, from January to April of this year, the first category was cereals and cereal flours, valued at 59,196,000 yuan; the second was candles, soap, oils, fats, waxes, rosin, valued at 42,246,000 yuan; the third was cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread, valued at 40,039,000 yuan; the fourth was sundries, valued at 22,413,000 yuan; the fifth was metals and mineral sands, valued at 20,065,800 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, except for a decrease in sundries and metals and mineral sands, the cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread category actually increased by 37,427,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Adjusting Exchange Rates to Encourage Exports</p>
<p>Since our government adjusted the exchange rate and HSBC and other British banks restricted the supply of black market foreign exchange, the Shanghai black market foreign exchange has tightened, which can reduce the import of useless foreign goods, and the trade deficit of Shanghai and Tianjin Customs will naturally be eliminated. The export of our country's main domestic goods can be increased. The government, in addition to striving to increase the production of tung oil, medicinal materials, mineral sands, silk, cotton, and other goods, also designates the Trade Commission, etc., to be responsible for control and centralized export from Hong Kong and other places. For the export of domestic goods that settle foreign exchange, in addition to exemption from export tax and transit tax, the Central Trust Bureau will also provide insurance on behalf of various insurance companies.</p>
<p>Stabilization Committee Responsible for Maintenance</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is determined to continue to maintain the Shanghai black market foreign exchange with all its strength, to ensure that the price is far from the break-even point. At the same time, HSBC and the committee are working together to stabilize the exchange rate of the Shanghai black market. For importers with legitimate needs, they will still provide as much foreign exchange as possible. Other banks such as The Mercantile Bank, Citibank, etc., are also taking the same action. Therefore, the exchange rate of the Shanghai black market has stabilized and will not collapse again. The statutory foreign exchange price of the Central Bank remains the same and has not changed in the slightest.</p>

<p>— By Captain Lao, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Summary of Previous Chapter: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kailong Boqi" was carrying eight million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Qiukes Company, and the mechanic Bill also took this opportunity to travel to Europe. On the ship, when Jack was acting as the wireless operator, he received a strange message saying that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wildly without a destination. Soon, a message came over the radio that there was an iceberg nearby. Passengers demanded that the speed be reduced, but the captain refused...</p>
<p>"We have already detected the iceberg, perhaps they will fire a steam horn to deal with that mountain with the echo."</p>
<p>"They won't fire the steam horn tonight. The captain has decided that we cannot reveal any traces, fearing that the cruiser will know our direction. I'm going to take a walk on the deck. Anyway, if anything comes on the radio, the bell will ring. Will you come with me?"</p>
<p>"Okay, but it's hardly an evening for a stroll."</p>
<p>"In any case, it's better than knowing nothing and squatting in this cabin!"</p>
<p>"You seem very excited, Jack."</p>
<p>"It's not entirely for myself. Just think, this several-thousand-ton steel ship is flying at twenty-four knots, with an iceberg ahead. Isn't that madness?"</p>
<p>"Come on, at sea, what the captain says is law, there's no arguing. We can only hope for the best."</p>
<p>On the lower deck, there were piles of passengers huddled behind the thick curtains that shielded the light. On the upper deck, however, there were only Jack and Bill. Although they tried to talk about other things, they kept thinking about the iceberg. Looking at the darkness ahead, and the ship drilling into the darkness like a bullet, they felt a ghostly feeling all around.</p>
<p>Time passed moment by moment. The fog did not lighten. Although it was August weather, the cold air penetrated to the bone. Jack and Bill had almost decided to return to the cabin, when suddenly the lookout at the front let out a sharp cry. Involuntarily, Bill grabbed Jack's arm. This tense situation far exceeded what they had expected to encounter.</p>
<p>In an instant, death seemed to have arrived. In the fog, vaguely, a huge white specter could be seen. It stood upright, almost reaching the ship's mast, appearing to be a wall hanging in front of the ship.</p>
<p>A great cry immediately rose on the deck, followed by a rough echo. On the passenger decks below, a woman let out a piercing scream, followed by frightened cries. In just a moment, a slight tremor, followed by a long and violent shudder, threatened the ship's hull. This large iceberg had obviously split open. But, in fact, the ship miraculously only suffered slight friction on both sides and drifted past safely, continuing on its journey after reducing its speed a little.</p>
<p>"We escaped death!" Jack shouted after the iceberg disappeared into the dense fog.</p>
<p>"Really, I thought we were done for," Bill said miserably. "This little incident really took a lot of effort, cough!"</p>
<p>The frightened crowd on the lower deck broke out in an uproar. Now, it was possible to hear a hysterical woman shouting, sharply and forcefully. It was presumed that she was yelling at a crew member, who was trying to calm them down, but the people who had suffered sudden fright were making a clamor.</p>
<p>"They're coming this way!" Jack suddenly shouted. Footsteps could be heard rushing up, quickly reaching the position of the wireless cabin. "Bill, quickly, we are at the forefront."</p>
<p>"Yes! If this group runs to the lifeboats, they will run around like crazy ghosts. What about us?"</p>
<p>"Run to the wireless room. In the desk drawer, for safety, there are two pistols, one is Bofu's, and one is mine. Hurry!"</p>
<p>Bill didn't need long to get there this time. But, in the instant he left, these panicked passengers had almost crossed the long corridor and run to the lifeboats. Jack stood in front.</p>
<p>"Calm down, everyone!" He shouted loudly. "There is no danger."</p>

<p>The Soviet Union still seems to be a rather mysterious country, and many people want to explore it. Here is a story, whether it is true or false, the source is not responsible.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, an American reporter arrived in Moscow. He visited red officials.</p>
<p>He first met Comrade Simonov, a respectable figure. There was just one strange thing: a large spittoon was placed right on his desk, which was really puzzling to him.</p>
<p>"Comrade Simonov," the reporter asked, "please forgive me for asking, but why do you put this thing on your desk?"</p>
<p>He didn't know that this question actually made Simonov furious. "That's my spittoon!" he shouted. "I can put it wherever I like!"</p>
<p>In Comrade Li Nuozhi's office, a chair was hanging from the ceiling. The inquisitive reporter asked again. Comrade Li also became furious. "That's my chair," he said angrily. "I like to put it like this."</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter went to see Stalin. He asked about the strange actions of these officials.</p>
<p>"Ah, don't pay attention to them," Stalin said with a smile. "Those people are fools."</p>
<p>"But if they are fools," the reporter did not let up, "how can they be officials?"</p>
<p>This sentence also made Stalin's hair stand on end with anger.</p>
<p>"They are my fools," he roared. "I put them where I like!" Hitler's Four-Year Plan</p>

<h3 id="e44">Fellow Townsman <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>A certain organization where people of a certain surname swarm like bees and ants can be called a "Surname Ancestral Hall." Similarly, a certain organization where people from a certain region gather like maggots and flies can be called a "Hometown Association" or "Regional Guild Hall."</p>
<p>The creation of such "Hometown Associations" or "Guild Halls" is, of course, due to those in higher positions not forgetting their origins and offering assistance. Examples from the past include the Warden of Sishui Pavilion arranging positions for people from Fengpei and Gushui. Recent examples include the Dog Meat General providing opportunities for barbers and foot masseuses from Yexian County. Thus, within these "Associations," if you're not royalty, you're bound to be a high-ranking official or nobleman wearing a yellow jacket. Then, they call upon their friends and relatives, creating a pure and magnificent spectacle. When Liu An attained enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascended to immortality. If you're not a chicken or a dog, don't even think about getting involved. If you, with your dignified seven-foot frame, try to replace the chickens and dogs, it's even more impossible, and you'd be lucky to escape without being pecked or bitten. After all, Liu An belongs to them, not to you!</p>
<p>The unity of those with the same surname is the backbone of a patriarchal society. Similarly, the support of those from the same hometown is a vestige of the feudal system. I can't bear to say that a patriarchal society is wrong. Similarly, how dare I say that the feudal system is bad? Furthermore, erudite scholars often use present-day examples to prove that the feudal system is not entirely wrong, and the existence of hometown relationships is both inevitable and necessary. They say:</p>
<p>When Chinese people go abroad, all Chinese people are fellow townsmen in that foreign country. In the future, when people from Earth go to Mars or any other planet, people from Earth will be fellow townsmen on that planet. When people from the solar system go to another star system, people from our solar system will be fellow townsmen in that other star system. When people from this universe go to another universe, people from this universe will be fellow townsmen in that other universe... So, to narrow it down and make it more immediate, within an organization, recognizing someone as a fellow townsman instantly creates a sense of closeness. And the belief that those not of our kind are sure to be of a different mind is not surprising.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I want to be a spoilsport and say, since we are all fellow townsmen within the same universe, or to put it more simply, since all Chinese people are fellow townsmen, isn't such a large "hometown" good enough? Why must we insist on these small "hometowns" where we are doing a temple in a snail shell? The scholars retort that this is a division of labor, accumulating drops to form a bag: with small hometowns, it's naturally easier to combine them into a large hometown; everyone organizes small hometowns, excluding those who are not fellow townsmen: the way of the ancient kings, this is beautiful. Once they bring up the ancient kings, I can only remain silent because I am, after all, a modern person and don't understand the ancient kings.</p>
<p>However, the human heart is, after all, made of flesh. Thinking about all the good things that hometown associations do, it's truly impossible to ignore them. For example, hometown associations have mortuaries, so you won't be left without a place to be buried when you die. Hometown associations transport coffins, so you'll be able to return to your homeland after death, your soul returning to your ancestral graves… The Chinese, who traditionally pay attention to posthumous glory, must rely on hometown associations to be able to die in peace. So, who knows, maybe these concrete, microcosmic "hometown associations," these certain organizations, might not only place the living but also the dead? We should especially praise their boundless merits on this point.</p>
<p>Because fellow townsmen offer so many benefits, most people like to recognize fellow townsmen. If there is a big shot or any famous person among the fellow townsmen, that is naturally their glory, especially something to boast about to everyone they meet. Neighboring provinces are also fellow townsmen. Within a province, those from the same prefecture, district, or special region are fellow townsmen. The starting point of a hometown is originally the county, but when necessary, the definition is expanded. Even when there is only the name of fellow townsman without the reality, people still keep saying "fellow townsman, fellow townsman." It seems that the term "fellow townsman" is truly mesmerizing.</p>
<p>"Su Xiao from Qiantang is a fellow kinsman," "kinsman" means "fellow townsman," "Hou Shi Weng" was so delighted about it. "Fellow countrymen" going on stage in Tianjin, won so much welcome, "Stopping the boat to ask each other, perhaps we are fellow countrymen," sweet voice, seeing his personality…</p>
<p>However, you may want to recognize him as a fellow townsman, but he refuses to recognize you as a fellow townsman. This happens a lot. The reason is that you are obviously down on your luck, and he is obviously successful. You will be a detriment to him, so of course, he won't acknowledge you. Gongsun Hong of the Han Dynasty sighed and said: "I'd rather meet a nasty guest than an old friend," which is the same principle. And those who betray fellow townsmen to curry favor are not unheard of. It is said that in the past, imperial censors often impeached their relatives, old friends, and fellow townsmen, because only they knew the details of their fellow townsmen's wrongdoings and could avoid errors based on hearsay…</p>
<p>Writing this far, I can't help but feel a chill about fellow townsmen. What should I do?</p>
<h3 id="e45">In the Mountain Hollow <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou</p>
<p>After walking through that wheat field, ahead was a dangerous pass flanked by bare, bald rocky mountains. Next to the pass stood a high mountain covered with green grass—so majestic and perilous that if the enemy had just one machine gun positioned there, we could never pass through the valley. But they were blocking the mountain peaks in front of the highway, thinking we would definitely follow the highway, unaware that we were detouring through this route.</p>
<p>Just as we were walking through the narrow pass, suddenly a plane came chasing after us from behind. Everyone was anxious and wanted to disperse quickly, but in this rugged valley with no cover, scattering was impossible. There was no choice but to be bold and ignore it, continuing to move forward dispersed.</p>
<p>After passing through the pass, we sat at the foot of a mountain, waiting for Division Commander Zhang, who was behind us. An endless stream of troops emerged from the pass like a flood, blurring our vision. Suddenly, three heavy bombers flew over, making a terrifying, deep sound. The men and horses scattered and lay prone beside the road and in the wheat fields. But some of the men and horses had nowhere to hide and could only squat on the road, letting the horses eat the grass by the roadside.</p>
<p>The three heavy bombers, gleaming in the sunset, leisurely circled in the sky, flying over the pass and suddenly swooping down.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A burst of fire erupted, followed by a thin plume of black smoke that drifted in the sky and slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>The mountains and fields were unusually silent. Only the monotonous buzzing sound echoed.</p>
<p>After circling once, the three heavy bombers flew to the front, not far away, and a long series of explosions rang out like thunder:</p>
<p>——Boom! Boom! Boom!…</p>
<p>A plane flew back, suddenly descending and swooping over the wheat field with half its wings tilted, strafing:</p>
<p>——Da-da-da-da…</p>
<p>Following the brothers of the Special Service Company, we lay neatly at the foot of the mountain, watching helplessly as the three planes, full of arrogance and shame, patrolled madly in the sky, our hearts filled with extreme anger!</p>
<p>The sun set, the sky was gloomy, and the night crept to the far side of the fields, appearing somewhat hazy. Only then did the three planes fly away.</p>
<p>The brothers who had been lying by the roadside and in the wheat fields, resting enough, got up, smiles on their faces:</p>
<p>"Damn it, they come to bomb us every day, but they never manage to kill us!"</p>
<p>"Those big liars, after bombing us today, I wonder how they'll tell their people: How many of us they killed today!"</p>
<p>"Their people are so pitiful! Their hard-earned money is just used by their warlords to buy bombs and drop them on our land, and they are deceived by their propaganda every day. What injustice!"</p>
<p>Treading on the vast twilight, along an uneven dirt road, the troops set off again.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Pit (Part 2) <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Dian Chang</p>
<p>He was wailing and singing up there, so unpleasant, so miserably…</p>
<p>At this time, only my shoulders were showing above ground; looking ahead, a blood-red sun hung in the sky, empty and deserted…I started to get worried, wiped the sweat from my forehead, and dug, dug, dug.</p>
<p>Now, my body was completely buried in the pit, only my head was above ground. Dig, dig, my hands were already a bit sore. Damn it!</p>
<p>I shivered and pretended to dig, dig, stealing a glance and seeing him hand over the shredded banknotes, putting on a demonic face. I ignored him. He stomped his feet and muttered as he paced past. I couldn't help cursing under my breath and raised the shovel casually. Whoosh, mud splattered over, and some even landed on the guy's leggings. He turned his head sharply, retreated a few steps hurriedly, cowering, clutching the gun tightly, and pulled the trigger…but then didn't, just grumbling hatefully. I couldn't help but suppress a laugh, bent down to dig, dig; I thought about raising the shovel again, splashing him all over his head and face, but I didn't do it this time.</p>
<p>I looked ahead and saw two legs moving over, so I bent down again to dig, dig; suddenly, with a pat, he turned away again, the sound of footsteps gradually fading from my ears. I then breathed a sigh of relief and pushed all the mud behind me, piling it higher and higher on the ground.</p>
<p>I thought, if that guy came from behind and kicked me a few times, sweeping all the mud down, I would be completely buried here.</p>
<p>The sweat flowed from my forehead. Was this really digging my own father's grave? Is this my tomb? Sigh, the more I thought about it, the more frightened I became…So, I hurriedly turned my head, raised up on tiptoe, and looked around. Then, I busily carved the pit wall, desperately digging out a few mud steps.</p>
<p>After a while, I heard a faint sound of footsteps nearby. So, I pressed myself tightly against the pit wall, stepped on the pit wall with my right foot, looked over the ground, and saw that the guy's legs suddenly turned slightly backwards, but then stopped again.</p>
<p>I immediately stepped up a step, my heart jumping and jumping, but I saw that the guy was holding his rifle, aiming at someone running towards him.</p>
<p>"Bang—" The gunshot pierced the long sky. I hurriedly ducked down, waited a while, then used the shovel to prop myself up and look. The two legs in front were shaking and retreating. The guy's knees buckled to the sides once, then straightened again, and he stood still.</p>
<p>"Bang—" I thought that the person who was running was finished, so I lay on the pit wall and listened quietly. The sound of leather boots rubbing against the ground was very clear. I tiptoed again, and the two trembling legs were only five or six feet away from my head. Suddenly, I became excited unconsciously. Quickly climbing up from the pit wall, I rolled onto the ground. But the guy immediately turned his head, stabbing at me with his rifle like a mad dog.</p>
<p>"Bang—" My vision went black, and braving the gunfire, I stood up mightily, taking the opportunity to swing the shovel and strike him on the shoulder with force. He fell down stiffly.</p>
<p>I wiped the sweat from my forehead and smiled proudly at this horizontal yellow candle. I looked into the distance again, and the person who was walking this way.</p>
<p>"Haha, is that Lu Ci A Ba?" I saw that it was him and called out, "I saved your life!"</p>
<p>He walked closer slowly, holding a Mauser pistol in his hand, and said calmly, "I've been watching you dig your grave for quite some time. Now, bury him."</p>
<p>So, I went over to take a closer look, and the ground was covered in blood. I looked to see how deep the wound on his shoulder was - this was my masterpiece, such a powerful strike.</p>
<p>But there wasn't even a tear in the guy's clothes on his shoulder, and blood was gushing from his back.</p>
<p>I then understood and greeted Lu Ci A Ba with shame:</p>
<p>"I was digging a grave for the grandson for a long time, I'm really tired: thank you, help me carry it to that pit, okay?"</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Truth <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>If there was no truth in the world, I would add this one: if there are already many truths, I only believe in this one: "Will is the first life of mankind."</p>
<p>If I had not established this belief in my heart long ago, I might have committed suicide because of that setback two years ago; if it weren't for the encouragement of this sentence, I would have been surprised to ask myself: why haven't I shed a single tear for a disappointing thing in recent years?</p>
<p>Currently, countless people have lost their homes, but they don't complain to anyone. They feel that in these difficult times, perseverance and fighting spirit are more precious than gaining the sympathy of others.</p>
<p>Friends! If you believe this is a truth, you should continue to believe it. If you don't know it yet, then please think it over carefully.</p>
<h3 id="e48">From Chengdu to Xi'an <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Huanping</p>
<p>7.  Hanzhong Permeated with Wartime Atmosphere</p>
<p>Hanzhong (Nanzheng), which I yearned for during the four days of arduous travel and couldn't wait to reach even a minute earlier, finally arrived at 3 p.m. on the 14th. I jumped off the bus, handed in the ticket, and carried my luggage out of the station. At the station gate was the military police's luggage inspection station. I said to a military policeman:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, please inspect my luggage!"</p>
<p>I put my suitcase down and wanted to open the lock. I don't know what power made him believe me, he said:</p>
<p>"Alright, you can go out!"</p>
<p>At this moment, another military policeman was inspecting the luggage of three students who came with me, opening their books one by one to look at them. He said:</p>
<p>"I know you students can't bring anything with you. I just want to check what books you are reading. Because there are many books that you don't know are prohibited."</p>
<p>After leaving the station, I took a rickshaw south into the city. Looking at the city walls, they were still quite solid. The city gate had double walls. Like other cities in the north, there was a three-story ancient-style gate tower above the city gate, with the four large characters "Yongliang Lock" written on it. After entering the city gate, I stayed at the Fuxing Grand Hotel on the right side. There are many hotels and inns; this is a better one. It is a two-story wooden building with fresh paint. The rooms are divided into special rooms upstairs, costing $1.50 per day; Class A rooms upstairs cost $1 per day. Class B rooms downstairs cost 80 cents per day; Class C rooms cost 60 cents per day. Quilts are charged separately, at 10 cents each. I stayed in a single room upstairs, with only a wooden bed frame, using wheat straw as a mattress, without a pillow: a long table, also used as a washbasin stand, and a wooden hanger. The four walls are covered with patterned paper, still fairly clean; there is a wooden lattice window, covered with thin paper instead of glass; facing the city wall, the light and air are not bad. Compared to the inns in Mianyang County and Guangyuan County that cost 20 cents a night, this is like heaven.</p>
<p>I toured the city for a week. The shops are still all wooden bungalows, the roads are quite narrow and also broken. There are quite a few watch shops, including a branch of Heng De Li; there are also many photo studios, and they are decorated most luxuriously; are the people here very fond of weddings and taking pictures? There are also many clothing stores and laundry shops. There are three or four bookstores, such as Shenghuo and Bingxue, but there are not many books. The citizens' clothing seems slightly better than what I saw along the way; along the street, I saw soldiers wearing grass-green uniforms; perhaps there are many civil servants working here. Occasionally, I saw women dressed neatly. Also, because this place is in the middle of the North China and Central China battlefields, closer to the front lines; and because of the reasons of war, anti-Japanese slogans and comics are written and posted all over the streets. The anti-war atmosphere seems to be much stronger than in Chengdu. In several places along the road, I saw a pile of ruins and rubble, and workers were still excavating. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e49">"July 7th" War of Resistance and National Revival Anniversary - Savings and Bond Purchasing Campaign to be Held - The Savings Bond Branch Today Sent a Circular to All Overseas Chinese Organizations - The Amount of Bonds Sold in Hong Kong is Still Two Million Yuan Short <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Tangxi Geji to Hold Another Charity Performance and Donation —</p>
<p>"On the anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance, local overseas Chinese organizations initiated an expanded campaign to promote the purchase of national salvation bonds. The Savings Bond Promotion Branch, in order to ensure that all organizations act in unison and achieve good results, specially proposed this matter for discussion at the 29th Standing Committee meeting held yesterday afternoon. More than ten people attended yesterday, including the chairman and standing committee members. Chairman Zhou Shousen reported the number of bonds raised and donations, and then began discussing the expansion of the bond campaign. Chairman Zhou stood up and explained the meaning of the expanded bond campaign on "July 7th." The committee members unanimously believed that "July 7th" is the anniversary of the national revival of our country. If overseas Chinese in Hong Kong purchase bonds in unison on this anniversary, its significance will be even greater, and national bonds can also be sold smoothly, greatly enhancing the strength of the motherland. They unanimously expressed their approval and decided to pass a resolution. The method is for the Savings Bond Branch to issue a circular to all overseas Chinese organizations in Hong Kong, requesting them to work hard to save money and purchase bonds around the "July 7th" anniversary. It is expected that the circular was already drafted last night and will be issued today.

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e52">Representatives from Various Circles of Relief Associations Present a Banner Yesterday, Sending Off the China Salvation Drama Troupe, Wishing Everyone Well, See You Again at Work <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Although "welcoming and sending off" is a "routine matter" in social interactions, the sincerity of the heart has different degrees.</p>
<p>As soon as the China Salvation Drama Troupe arrived in Hong Kong, the climax of welcome surged up. What did the China Salvation Drama Troupe rely on to win such care from overseas Chinese? The answer is very simple: they overcame the lifestyle that should be promoted in the great era, sharing joys and sorrows with soldiers and the people. In serious work, they humbly learned. They used drama and all possible methods to touch tens of millions of soldiers and civilians in the north and south battlefields for twenty months. — Such a group that was born for the war of resistance and grew up in the war of resistance, full of enthusiasm and strength, won people's love, and it was not accidental.</p>
<p>For two months, the life attitude and mutual expression of the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" in Hong Kong proved that they did not live up to the expectations of the welcomers. At the very least, the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" spiritually influenced upward-minded compatriots, making people deeply experience the strict discipline. Strict life, high enthusiasm, and correct understanding are indispensable elements for forming a sound group. In terms of drama movement, "China Salvation Drama Troupe" made people deeply realize the great role of national defense drama that reflects and promotes the era, giving a strong encouragement to drama workers and an opportunity for reflection to those who still have prejudices against national defense drama.</p>
<p>Therefore, when "China Salvation Drama Troupe" is about to go abroad to continue propaganda, "sending off" is more meaningful, and the send-off party has a higher degree of sincerity.</p>
<p>Various Circles of Relief Associations held a joint meeting with various overseas countries at the library on the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 1 pm yesterday to send off and hold a banner presentation ceremony to strengthen the trip and encourage those who come.</p>
<p>Those who participated in the farewell party included Li [missing name] from the Journalists Association, Liu Qing [missing name] from the Women's War Relief Association, Fei Zhaoruolan from the Young Women's Association, Xiong Maozhao and Su Anping from the Women's New Movement Association, Chen Lanfang [missing name] from the Zhisheng Charity, Lin Xingsheng from the Dongzhisheng Hospital, and Lin Peisheng from the Federation of Trade Unions.  The China Salvation Drama Troupe included head Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and all the troupe members, totaling dozens of people, gathered together, which was very lively. Although the weather was very hot, they enjoyed chatting with each other, and their hearts were very comforted. After refreshments, Chairman Li Jianfeng first delivered a speech, saying that today's meeting is both a reception and a farewell party. We are standing on the front line of national salvation today, and we are all members of the national salvation work, so today can be said to be an intimate meeting of workers. In today's environment, we only need to identify our goals and work together, diligently, hard, and painstakingly. Huang Zhaoruolan then spoke, praising the troupe's work and the dedication of the members.</p>
<p>Jin Shan and Wang Ying stood up and gave replies one after another, saying that the troupe passed through Hong Kong on this trip abroad and stayed for two months. Seeing that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are very enthusiastic about the work of saving the country, they feel very happy. After going abroad, they will definitely publicize the enthusiastic situation of the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong in saving the country to overseas Chinese everywhere, so that they can encourage each other. During the troupe's stay in Hong Kong, they have been welcomed and praised by all circles of overseas Chinese, and they feel ashamed. In the future, they will continue to work hard to repay the love of compatriots at home and abroad. After the speech, Cao Xueyu from the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Lu Guomian from the Zhongsheng Club spoke one after another, praising the troupe in many ways. Finally, the banner presentation ceremony was held. The Journalists Association presented a banner with the words "Winning Hearts is Paramount." The Relief Associations presented a banner with the words "Testifying in Person." Li Jian[missing character] presented a banner with the words "Verbal Condemnation". Each has a profound meaning, used to encourage each other. The chairman presented the banner on behalf of the group, and the head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, Jin Shan, accepted it. The farewell party ended happily at about 3 pm.</p>
<p>It is reported that there were many people who could not get tickets when the troupe performed at the Lee Theatre. Now, in response to the requests of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, they will give a farewell performance in Kowloon at the beginning of next month. After the performance, they will leave Hong Kong immediately. The procedures for obtaining passports have been completed in Shantou. The itinerary for this trip abroad is scheduled for eight months, and the destinations are the Philippines, the South Seas Islands, and San Francisco and Honolulu in the Americas.</p>
<p>As for the troupe's work plan, it can be roughly divided into two aspects: spiritual and economic. Regarding the spiritual aspect, drama, writing, speeches, picture exhibitions, and other methods will be used to make overseas Chinese deeply aware of the bright future of the motherland in hardship, and that the past contributions of money and effort have not been wasted at all. Regarding the economic aspect, it is planned to raise a huge sum of 500,000 yuan, the use of which is estimated as follows: 1. To establish wounded soldier reception stations, wounded soldier hospitals, and cultural supply stations in the war zone. 2. To establish reception homes for families of soldiers on expeditions, reception homes for orphans of war heroes who died in the war of resistance, and rehabilitation homes for disabled soldiers in the rear.</p>
<p>We believe that with the past abilities and spirit of the "China Salvation Drama Troupe", it will be able to complete this great mission. Our overseas Chinese in Hong Kong should also encourage them and help them complete this mission. We wish the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" a smooth journey and see you again in the future. The next gathering will be to gather all the forces of counterattack and participate in the final battle for the final victory of the motherland. Take care! We will meet at work.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Plans to Request Improvements in Pig Transportation Methods; All Bamboo Cages Used in the Past Easily Injure Pigs; Using Wooden Barriers for Transportation Can Eliminate This Problem; The Government Drafts Regulations for Bird Shops <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals yesterday published its annual report, which stated that due to the war, progress on improving the transportation of pigs and cattle has been hindered. Pigs transported to Hong Kong are all transported in bamboo cages, and after long land and water journeys, eight or nine out of ten are injured by bamboo shards or have their [body part] broken. The Society plans to request the authorities to prohibit the use of bamboo cages for transportation and switch to wooden barriers to avoid harming pigs. Bird shops that sell poultry should also be improved. The Society's inspectors and committee members visit various bird shops every week and believe that the general situation is worse than that of bird shops in Guangzhou. Most of the shops are dark and cramped. The Society has conveyed this idea to the government, and the government has now drafted regulations for bird shops, hoping that the health authorities will strictly enforce them in the future. The report also attacked the recent explorations by explorers who often go deep into the Chinese interior to capture pandas and display them in zoos around the world, considering it a cruel act, because pandas often suffer and die during this long journey. For the sake of the public's enjoyment, these ignorant animals are subjected to this suffering, which has to be called cruel. However, this kind of action is unfortunately beyond the power of the Hong Kong authorities and the Society to prohibit.</p>

One hundred and six cases have already been discovered this year, which is slightly less than the same period last year, but this proves the importance of preventive measures. In addition, 42 cases of tuberculosis were discovered in Hong Kong in the 24 hours before yesterday, and 3,396 cases were counted in the past six months, with an average of 566 cases per month. In addition, other infectious diseases discovered yesterday included three cases of intestinal fever and one case each of measles and cerebrospinal meningitis.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Central Market Returns Stalls; Merchants to Be Recruited Again at the End of This Month; A Total of Seventy-Three Stalls of Various Businesses; Interested Bidders Must Arrive on Time <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Hong Kong's population has increased sharply, and there has been a promising turnaround in various businesses. Generally, merchants are seeking to obtain a position during this period for business purposes. As a result, empty shops in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been rented out. The newly completed Central Market in the Central District is also the target of these merchants, who are seeking to obtain a stall in the new market for business purposes. When the Sanitary Bureau opened bidding for the stalls in the market, they did not hesitate to bid heavily against each other, and the monthly rent was as high as more than 280 yuan. In their opinion, they firmly believed that business would make great progress after the market opened, but the opposite was true. The market situation deteriorated day by day. Within a month of the market opening, some stallholders could not sustain their businesses due to excessive losses. They jointly requested the Sanitary Bureau to sympathize with the merchants' difficulties and reduce the rent to maintain their businesses, but the authorities did not seem to have any response. They were forced to stop their businesses and returned their stalls to the Sanitary Bureau, totaling as many as 73 stalls, including 7 fish stalls, 10 beef stalls, 13 pork stalls, 35 vegetable stalls, 5 fresh fruit stalls, and 3 chicken and duck stalls. Regarding this matter, according to the Sanitary Bureau's intention, it is planned to re-open bidding for these 73 stalls, and the bidding for pork, beef, fish, chicken, and duck stalls will be opened at 9:30 am on the 28th of this month, according to the original base price. The bidding for fresh fruit and vegetable stalls will also be held at 9:30 am on the 30th of this month at the Bureau, according to the original base price. The base price labels will be posted today.</p>

<p>The Norwegian cargo ship Tianshaya, which was moored in the waters of Sai Wan, arrived in Hong Kong on the 18th of this month (Sunday) with 6,000 tons of coal from Calcutta, India. This coal belongs to the Hong Kong Gas Company. Yesterday, the 20th, the company hired four large lighters and dozens of coal coolies, moored on both sides of the ship, to unload the coal. At 8:20 am, while the ship's crew and the coal coolies were busy working, a fire suddenly broke out in the cabin of Chief Officer Mona Hodge, located under the bow drawbridge of the ship. Thick smoke came out of the cabin, and the fire was extremely fierce. Fortunately, the shipowner Johnson saw it and immediately summoned 30 crew members, armed with fire hoses and fire extinguishers, and bravely rushed through the smoke to rescue the ship, regardless of the irritation of the thick smoke to their eyes and noses. After half an hour, the fire was finally extinguished. As for the cause of the fire in the cabin, it was found after investigation that it was caused by an electrical leak in the cabin. At that time, Mr. Moore was supervising the workers' work, so there was no one in the cabin, and there was no one in the neighboring cabins either. The door was tightly locked. Fortunately, shipowner Johnson discovered it in time and rescued the ship quickly, so the fire did not spread and the losses were very minimal. The ship, which carries 4,441 tons, was originally scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 23rd of this month (Friday), and the voyage will not be disrupted as a result.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Red Pill Manufacturing Operation Cracked in a Bay on Lantau Island; The Quantity of Narcotics Is Unprecedented in Recent Years; Five Defendants Sentenced to Five Years of Hard Labor <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Five people, Huang Guang, Yu Yao, and the women Li Liang, Zhu Qu, and He Rong, were previously charged with possessing 48 ounces of heroin powder, 56,200 red pills, and 960 ounces of powder containing narcotics in Da'ao Shan [missing character] Bay on the 17th of last month. The case was transferred to the High Court at 10 am yesterday, where Justice McKerron, together with jurors Deng Jian, Chen Jinshu, Bida Tumai, Di Gu Na, Ge Ming, and Ge Yun, jointly heard the case. The first defendant, Huang Guang, and the third defendant, Li Liang, pleaded guilty, while the other defendants pleaded not guilty. Senior Barrister Anderson defended them, and Government Barrister Wyatt prosecuted. The prosecutor first stated the case, saying that the amount of drugs seized in this case actually broke the record of the drug possession case cracked by the Customs Superintendent several years ago. The total amount of raw materials seized can be used to refine more than one million red pills. The details of the cracking of the case are as follows: Senior Customs Inspector Creamen and Woody received a report from an informant and sailed to a bay on Lantau Island on a customs patrol boat on the morning of the 17th of last month. They arrived at 7 am and landed together. They went to a house about 50 yards away from the beach. The house had two entrances. They went inside together and saw the fifth defendant standing alone in the front hall. They went straight to the inner entrance and saw five men and women sitting around a large bed, engaged in manufacturing red pills. Later, Inspector Wood examined the palms of the defendants, and only the fifth defendant's hands were not stained with red powder. This point cannot be said that he has nothing to do with this case. Later, the defendants, along with the narcotics and red pill manufacturing tools, were returned to the police station. After the narcotics were handed over to the government chemist for testing, it was believed that they could be used to make more than 1.1 million red pills. After collecting evidence and testimony, the government authorities charged them. After the prosecutor finished speaking, he summoned various relevant witnesses to testify. Finally, the second, fourth, fifth, and third defendants took the stand and pleaded not guilty. After both lawyers presented their opinions, Judge Mai gave a detailed explanation of the case to guide the jurors in their verdict. As a result, the jurors unanimously found the defendants guilty. The judge then sentenced all the defendants to five years of hard labor. (Note: It is rare for red pill manufacturers to be punished as severely as this time).</p>

<h3 id="e69">Stable Finances in Guangdong Province; Revenue and Expenditure Remain Balanced Despite Wartime <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>【Special Dispatch from Shaoguan】According to reliable sources from the Finance Department, the financial situation in Guangdong Province remains extremely stable despite wartime conditions. This is because the province's finances have undergone thorough reorganization in recent years, and all revenue and expenditure items have been brought onto the right track. Therefore, it is fortunate that revenue and expenditure can still be balanced, even though the entire province is in a state of war. Furthermore, according to the Finance Department's announcement of the revenue and expenditure figures during the tenure of former Director Zeng Yangfu, the accounts have now been thoroughly verified. In addition to ensuring that all military and administrative expenses borne by the provincial treasury are cleared on a monthly basis, as of the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), when he handed over the office, the treasury had a balance of over 6.62 million yuan in national currency. This included 2.88 million yuan deposited with the Provincial Bank and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau as agent treasuries, and 3.74 million yuan deposited with various banks. In addition, there were over 600,000 yuan in fines, etc., handed over during his tenure, totaling over 7.2 million yuan in national currency handed over to the new administration. Furthermore, there were treasury bills with a face value of over 4.8 million yuan in national currency. The current provincial treasury budget is approximately 1.3 million yuan per month, and the funds transferred are sufficient to cover one year of expenses. With some reorganization, it should be even more ample, and the future is very promising.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Our Guerrilla Force Is Extremely Active; Once Attacked Sanshui County Town; 500 Troops from Xin Xu × Army Withdraw to Guangzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(West River Quick News) On the evening of the 14th, the resting unit of the □th Brigade of the Sanshui Guerrilla Force gathered over a hundred men, all equipped with hand grenades, and advanced towards Sanshui County Town. Taking advantage of their familiarity with the terrain, they detoured to the base and charged into the city from the north. They first encountered the × security team guarding the city, and the national troops who had been ambushed in the city also rose up in response. At that moment, machine guns and hand grenades fired simultaneously, as dense as a string of firecrackers. The × soldiers were at a loss and their formation was in great disarray. After several hours of fierce fighting, our army began to retreat to its original position. It was later learned that over 50 × soldiers were killed, and many × fortifications and barracks were destroyed. Our side also suffered slight casualties.</p>
<p>He Kou × Army Shells Qing Qi</p>
<p>In recent days, the frontline × army has feared our forces emerging from the He River, and has frequently fired shells at our positions to threaten our army's crossing of the river. On the 16th and 17th, the Sanshui × army again set up cannons in Xin Xu, Gua Bang Ridge, Bao Ya Gang, and other places to bombard Qing Qi, Zhu Zhou, Heng Shi, Wang Lou, and other places, intermittently, firing throughout the day. The shelling was particularly intense on the morning of the 17th, starting from 8 a.m. to around 9 a.m., with over a hundred shells fired, but the range was inaccurate, and most of the shells landed in the wilderness, causing minimal losses to our side.</p>
<p>Part of the Xin Xu × Army Retreats</p>
<p>According to reports from the front, there are currently approximately 3,000 × soldiers in Sanshui, with the main force concentrated in He Kou, Xin Xu, and other places. It is estimated that there are 600-700 soldiers of the × Matsuno unit in Sanshui City and Southwest Town, and over 1,000 soldiers of the × Ikeda, Kanazawa, and Noo units in the He Kou and Xin Xu area. There are over 600 soldiers of the × Takada unit in Okane Maguchi, most of whom are engineers. It was learned that the Xin Xu × army has recently been sending teams to Lao Ya Zhou, Ge Wei, and other places to build fortifications and conscript and train young men. On the 15th and 16th of this month, over 500 × soldiers from Xin Xu returned to He Kou and retreated towards Guangzhou along the Bao-San Road. Their intentions are unclear.</p>

<p>(Zhongshan Quick News) At 4 a.m. on the 19th, our troops once again charged to Gangzhou Port in Xinhui County and Baisha Township between Jiangmen and Xinhui, killing a × pacification squad leader named Sanxiangjiao. From 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. that morning, the × army fiercely fired cannons from Dog Mountain in Du City, bombarding Xin Kai Road. Our artillery positions in the area also fired back, and the fighting was quite intense. Cannon fire was heard in Shiqi that morning. Yesterday (the 20th) morning, there was also very dense cannon fire from the Waihai area, which was fired at our troops who were counterattacking.</p>

<p>(South Road Quick News) In the South Road area of Guangdong Province, the × army has been harboring ambitions of invasion, so the × warships sometimes disperse and sometimes gather, and the situation is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed. Their intention is to confuse our troops. It was learned that recently, in order to spy on the secrets of our South Road militia defense, the × side dispatched a large number of pro-Japanese traitors and lackeys to infiltrate the inland and carry out their missions separately. Our authorities, aware of the violent × plot, have ordered strict investigations. Recently, many important pro-Japanese traitor agencies have been uncovered in Yangjiang, Maoming, Pu, and other places. The key figures have been captured in one fell swoop, and other outcasts in various places have also disappeared. The × disruptive conspiracy has completely failed. It was learned that their main agency is located on Hainan Island, named the "South Branch Special Service Agency," which recruits cold-blooded animals for training, especially welcoming local ruffians and gangsters from various counties in southern Guangdong, because they are familiar with the situation and can operate more easily. It was found that the first batch of 56 people completed their training on May 25th and infiltrated the inland to work at the locations designated by ×. Most of those recently captured by us belong to this group.</p>

<p>Victoria Swimming Club Sends Letter to Hong Kong Chinese Swimming Organizations for Meeting; Everything Can Be Decided After the Meeting on the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Shanghai interport swimming competition has been suspended for two sessions due to the current situation. Recently, the Victoria Swimming Club of Hong Kong received a letter from the Shanghai Swimming Association, inviting Hong Kong to send a team to compete and restore the past Hong Kong-Shanghai interport competition. After receiving the letter, the Victoria Swimming Club immediately sent letters to various Chinese and Western swimming organizations in Hong Kong, inviting them to send representatives to a meeting at the Victoria Swimming Club at 4:45 p.m. on Monday, the 26th of this month, to discuss everything. Whether Hong Kong will send a team to Shanghai for the competition will be decided on that day. If it is decided to go, the selection of personnel will also be carried out successively.</p>
<p>In the past, when the world was peaceful, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tianjin held interport aquatic competitions once a year. Now, Tianjin is blockaded by the Japanese, and the Tianjin British Concession is struggling to save itself, so it naturally has no leisure to send a team to compete. Since the British Concession has no such intention, the French Concession will not act alone, so the Tianjin area may not be invited. In the future, this year's interport aquatic competition will only be held between Hong Kong and Shanghai, which may feel monotonous. Will the athletes participating in the competition miss their comrades in Tianjin?</p>

<p>(Singapore 16th Airmail News) The South China Football Team arrived in Singapore yesterday morning at 7 a.m. with its elite troops. However, because the team had reached an agreement with the Yangon Football Club in Vietnam to compete in Yangon on the 21st of this month, the time was very tight. Therefore, they could not stay in Singapore for a long time. Upon arriving in Singapore, they unloaded their luggage and immediately played a game with the China Team to catch up with their appointment in Yangon. On the day the South China players arrived in Singapore, football fans rejoiced. Therefore, in yesterday's match against China, the Anshun Law Stadium was not only packed on the left and right sides, but also the one-dollar and five-cent seats on the East Curve grandstand were full. The total number of people was over 7,000, and the scene was unprecedentedly lively. The Consul-General of our embassy in Singapore and his wife also attended the match together. At 5:10 p.m., the South China players, wearing red and white jerseys, first greeted the audience. Then the China team also followed suit and entered the field. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>South China Team</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Li Guowei Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao</p>
<p>Luo Douwen Liu Songsheng Chen Dehui Feng Jingxiang Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>China Team</p>
<p>Li Botang</p>
<p>Sun Chunlai Wen Shunshan</p>
<p>Xu Yuankun Zhu Chenggui Ji Youling</p>
<p>Yan Jixiang Ruan Kunxiang Xie Qingfu Xia Zhixiang Wu Renshi</p>
<p>German Army Shoots Quickly; Record Opens First</p>
<p>With the lineup as described above, the referee blew the whistle, and the battle immediately broke out. China's Qingfu first issued an ultimatum, and then China's five forwards went north together. Qingbian dribbled the ball straight up and invaded the hinterland, but returned without success. The guest team's Jingxiang galloped horizontally and vertically in China's hinterland. Guowei took the opportunity to attack, but also worked hard to no avail. Right winger Jingxiang pressed the palace again, stopped the ball and passed it to Dehui. This gentleman led the charge but missed by a hair. It was China's blessing that this ball was not in. In the first few minutes of the battle, China's position was constantly ravaged by the guest team. Fortunately, his teammates worked together to defend, and they were able to turn the danger into safety. Later, China's five roads advanced forward, and the three fierce men in the middle followed and moved. In an instant, they had reached the bottom of the opponent's city. However, Qing's feet were not agile, and a big mistake was made. Around the eleventh minute of the battle, alarms were frequent under the city of China. Goalkeeper Botang, seeing the situation was critical, personally led the charge and pushed the ball back, falling beside Qingcai. Qingcai passed it to the middle, and Dehui took the opportunity to attack fiercely, and sure enough, he entered the room and opened the record first.</p>
<p>Divine Leg Is Effective; Douwen Reports Good News</p>
<p>After China lost a city, they were eager to avenge themselves. Jixiang took a breath and went straight to the bottom of the city. Qingfu knocked on the door, but still could not get the key. Two minutes later, the second alarm was sounded under the city of China. The guest car Songsheng sent a secret signal. Jingxiang, receiving the secret report, would not lose the opportunity. With a labor of one foot, China broke through another pass.</p>
<p>At that time, it was time for the guest team to dominate the world. Douwen on the left saw his comrades crowned and promoted, and could not help but feel hot and red. Therefore, he seized an opportunity in China's second line of defense and shot from afar, hitting the target. At this point, China had lost half of Jiangnan and was laughing. The audience around, seeing China lose three passes in a row, were all worried about the future of the home team. Fortunately, when the battle reached the 26th minute, China's Zhixiang rode alone for thousands of miles and pressed the switch in the opponent's third line of defense, shooting a bullet from afar, which really went straight to Huanglong. This ball was not only unexpected by the South China players, but also unimaginable by the general audience. At halftime, the score was 3-1, with South China leading.</p>
<p>Dehui and Qingfu Shine Together</p>
<p>After moistening their throats with ice water, they changed places and fought again. South China, taking advantage of the victory, ordered their troops to march north. The entire army, in a mighty manner, attacked the main force's defense again. Rongzhao pointed east, and Dehui took the opportunity to act. Although Botang went out of the city to meet the enemy, the bullet had already penetrated the net. Although China was humiliated again, its morale was even more boosted, and it launched a counterattack. Rengshi, a fresh force, came from afar, and the bullet was passed to the middle. Kunxiang turned his head, and the ball went over the edge of the city. Afterwards, the guest car Jingxiang also once attacked a ball no more than ten meters away from China's city gate, kissing Botang. After China recovered from this crisis, the time came, and they went straight to the top. Eleven minutes after the resumption of the battle, Qingfu tried his best to win back a ball. Not long after, Qingfu once again made a contribution. At this point, China was only one goal behind. Afterwards, although both sides fought desperately to compete for the final territory, they fought for more than ten minutes, and neither side made any progress. Time flew by like a white horse passing through a gap. In a blink of an eye, it was time to end the game. The referee blew the silver whistle, and both sides reined in their horses and withdrew their troops to rest in camp. The score for the whole game was 4-3, with South China triumphing.

<p>The Jin Quan Cup table tennis tournament has entered the final stage. Tonight (21st) there will be a women's match, with South A playing against the Xinxiu team. This match is a championship battle between the two teams and is of utmost importance. In terms of strength, South A has Yang Weibin, Mo Huanqiong, Shi Baolian, Luo Xiushui, and Lu Cuiying, all of whom can attack and defend well. And the Xinxiu team, such as Chen Meiyou, Lu Zhaoyi, Zhu Jiaoxin, Chen Cui, and Pan Yinghong, are also masters in their own right. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle between the two sides. However, the South A players are more experienced and should have a chance of winning.</p>

<p>The B Group basketball finals have reached the final stage. Tonight's finale has two matches. After this, when the rose blooms are over, you will have to wait until next year to see them again. According to the schedule, the first match tonight is Chunfeng vs. International, but Chunfeng was disqualified by the league for using a Qingming player in place of another last week, so it has been changed to Guangzhong vs. Huaxiong. The second match is Li Hang vs. Pei Ying.</p>
<p>In the Guangzhong vs. Huaxiong match, neither team has a chance of winning the championship. However, in terms of strength, Guangzhong has good coordination, and Huaxiong has a strong offensive, each with its own advantages, and there should be a fierce battle. As for the Li Hang vs. Pei Ying match, both teams once lost to International, and the championship has become a bubble. However, the two teams have equal scores and are both in second place. Tonight's match is a battle for second place. Li Hang has Lin Youpei, Lu Dezhang, Huang Jiuwu, and Chen Yuting, all of whom are capable and experienced. Pei Ying's combat power is also extremely fierce, and there are also generals such as Guan Zhenbin, Zhao Zhenyuan, and Chen Xiyang. Their skills are evenly matched, and it is impossible to predict who will win.</p>

<p>Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics; Zou Falu</p>
<p>Lecture</p>
<h3 id="e87">Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>"New Gymnastics" is what? When was "New Gymnastics" discovered? Some people may have such questions. Before this so-called "New Gymnastics" is popularized throughout the country (Guangxi has not seen this kind of gymnastics, and what about the provinces southwest and beyond, I dare not make a dogmatic judgment), it is not surprising that those who have not tried it have questions. Therefore, before writing this article, the definitions of new and old gymnastics seem to need explanation.</p>
<p>The so-called "New Gymnastics" is what Professor Wu Cheng of the Physical Education Department of National Central University and others have advocated a few years ago. It is a combination of European and American (mostly German) new gymnastics and Chinese martial arts movements, which have been transformed and melted by Mr. Wu and others. It has been popular in East China for several years, especially in Jiangsu Province, where it has been implemented more effectively. Old gymnastics, of course, is the gymnastics that our country has always used. Now that a kind of gymnastics that is different from the ones that have always been used has been discovered, it seems appropriate to call it "New Gymnastics", and it is also acceptable to call the ones that have always been used "Old Gymnastics".</p>
<p>After explaining the definitions of the names, I have a statement, that is, this "comparison view" is entirely what I feel after practicing both new and old gymnastics. I dare not blindly say whether the inventor Mr. Wu meant it this way, so I hope that Mr. Wu will correct it after seeing this text.</p>
<p>The comparison of new and old gymnastics can be discussed from several aspects such as movement, method, amount of exercise, and use of muscles and value.</p>
<p>A. In terms of movement, the movement can be compared from the following points:</p>
<p>First, the difference between "lifting" and "swinging": The "swinging" movement in new gymnastics is equivalent to the "lifting" in old gymnastics. The "lifting" movement, after being lifted to a certain part, must be slightly paused, and then the next movement is done. The "swinging" movement, after swinging to a certain part, is immediately swung back, without any pause. We can see the true meaning of this movement by looking at the pendulum. From this, we can understand: "Lifting" is moving and stopping, stiff, and swinging is continuous, lively. (One)</p>
