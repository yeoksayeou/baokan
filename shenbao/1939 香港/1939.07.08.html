<h3 id="c1">抗戰兩週年與×人的×× <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們的對日全面抗戰已於昨日滿了兩個整年；我們已經用壯烈的犧牲，粉碎了×人「一年半載征服中國，再用一年或半載善後戰局」的迷夢了。囘顧這兩個整年中，×人在華作戰的消長及其政治外交的變化，×人由旺戰而停頓，而衰退的過程，皆歷歷可指。就曳勢看來，無論軍事，政治，經濟，社會，莫不皆達到狼狽的階段了。</p>
<p>×人在軍事上以南京佔領的沿海戰期為最得利時期，但自入徐州會戰　卽進展頗遲緩，目入我們粵漢棄守後卽又幾乎完全陷於停頓，並且日益衰退了。自去年，月間以迄現在為時八月有餘，×人未能如期再佔領更多据點，即遭意外大火的長沙，×且不能乘勢進佔，只南昌一城為所据而已。其後，×軍雖也曾××××於南北戰塲上，但皆無多大成就，只是徒然勞師耗財而已。</p>
<p>在政治方面，×人也隨着軍事的衰落而有日益紊亂的情狀。自「七七事變」濘成我們全面抗戰的情勢以來，×人卽着力於內政機構的增强，乃有「內閣參議制」，「企劃院」，「厚生省」，「企劃密議會」，乃至「大本營之設。近衛內閣又有兩次補強的改組，特別是去年五月間的大改組，在本質上及形式上皆有了相當力量的補充。日本政府到這時候，纔能算是消地地成了戰時內閣。但以侵華戰爭的停頓，為各方所囑望，主觀條件最具備的近衛首相，也終於不能不斷然提出總辭呈，而由「最不孚衆望」的平沼內閣來承繼。平沼內閣上台後，與近衛前內閣情勢完全兩樣，不但毫無具體政策宣佈出來，並且夾雜於元老重臣派與少壯軍人派之間，左右為難，其政治的效率，幾可說完全等於零。最近雖徒然欲以什麼「蛻多政略」來應付內外的危局，但其結果仍不能避去日本資本主義自其胎中帶來的政治矛盾性××××的支配。</p>
<p>在外交上，其狼狽的情形，更為顯露，兩重性的相尅，演至最近似有如前例，政府終於隨着軍權的××後面跑的傾向……這是日本資本主義發展過程上顚倒關係的特殊性……但其必碰到內外的障得而重再燃起二軍性的矛盾與危機，則又可斷言。東京英日的談判，未必就順利，對美的討好，如今日日方的宣稱，未必就有效果，對蘇的威脅碰到「加倍的還擊」，自更無庸言。希特勒對日本警吿雖然極切……是由於對日本戰爭力量的觀察的結果——但日本低能兒的政治家及軍閥，却無法承担這個重任，打開自己的僵局。海軍方面雖承獎若驚，華南沿海的騷擾也不過騷擾騷擾罷了；陸軍方面雖因希特勒欲恢複元氣須十七八年」的指摘頗覺頹喪，並欲以對蘇妄動作表面振作，但結果也不過碰壁，自取沒趣罷了。</p>
<p>我們紀念抗戰二週年。還要深到正視×人軍事，政治，經濟。社會各方面的狼狽。</p>
<h3 id="c2">中日戰爭之　政略與戰略問題 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 軍事委員會某要員報告</p>
<p>（本報特稿）中央軍事委員會某要員最近巡視各戰區前泉在某地對某某某等區對×後戰鬥指揮人員發表這一報告，這是一個簡略　記錄，經某委員親自過目，除部份删略外，特寫發以饗我國人：</p>
<p>緒　——戰爭是政策的繼續，因此戰略是服從政略的，兩國政策，×對的發展到最高階段便要發生戰爭，於是政略與戰略的關係更為密切，戰略的成敗，必影響政絡。</p>
<p>（一）×人方面</p>
<p>【一】×人侵略玫策的歷史階段</p>
<p>喬併中國獨霸束亞是×人侵華之一貫的國策——尤其是日本軍閥所奉爲唯一的國策，這是從日本明治大帝蹦策一直發展到現在的，</p>
<p>一，甲午戰後為第一階段，實施以華制華的分裂政策；</p>
<p>二，九一八後為第二階段，實施不戰而勝的蠶食政策；</p>
<p>三，七　事變起為第三階段，實施一戰而勝中國的鯨呑政策</p>
<p>上述政策雖有各個階段之不同，但基本的政策師國事是一貫的。所以配合這些政策在各方面也有各階段之不同。甲，對華方面</p>
<p>第一階段是以經濟侵略為主——在中國便　生以抵貨為主的運動；</p>
<p>第二階段是以玫治侵略為主；在中國便會生不承認偽滿，及冀東察北偽政權以抗日的政治鬥爭為主的救亡運動；</p>
<p>第三階段是以軍事侵略為言——在中國發生抗戰。</p>
<p>乙，對內力面</p>
<p>第一階段獎匯資本外流——于是經濟發展財閥形成，引起軍閥嫉視，</p>
<p>第二階叚特務機關活躍——軍人暴戾殘殺大臣引起財閥反抗？</p>
<p>第三階叚海陸空軍聯合行動——軍閥專政財閥附庸引起人民不滿丙，對外政策。</p>
<p>第一階叚與各國競爭——引起九國公約限制日本發展；</p>
<p>第二階叚排斥各國在華利益——造成各國不滿漸趨孤立；</p>
<p>第三階叚企圖獨霸東亞——引起各國反對，（二）×人侵華的軍事政策</p>
<p>第一階叚為發展國力時期——目的在與列强齊驅；</p>
<p>第一階叚為加强國力時期——目的在超過東方任何一國；</p>
<p>第二階叚為使用國力時期—目的在迅速征服中國利用中國國力獨霸東亞準備太平洋大戰，結果變成為消耗國力，（三）×人侵掠戰爭之戰絡方針，</p>
<p>依據其國策及一般的政策，日×侵掠之戰　方針，無疑的是速戰速决，實現此戰絡之條件有三；</p>
<p>一，消減主力——主要的依靠正面火力殺傷，以削弱我之主力，無非依靠迂迴包圍我之主力，以企圖殲滅；</p>
<p>二，佔領土地——奪取大城市紗濟封鎖；</p>
<p>三，喪失我方戰鬥意志—製造偽政權孤立我國，挑撥我國內鬨，散佈和平空氣。</p>
<p>但一期作戰證明這些方針是失敗了，何以故？因為：一，基本上×人對自已認識不足，對我估計錯誤：</p>
<p>二，×軍雖强而小，本錢不足，×人又多捨不得用；我雖弱而大，人口多，對×人唯一能犧牲，又能保存，繼續戰鬥，故×人喪失戰鬥力的企圖未能做到成了，我土地大×人佔不了許多，只為點與綫，且我又為農業國，雖失城多，仍能自給，外路仍通，輕濟難封銷，而×人自亦急欲通商，</p>
<p>三，×人太野蠻，退化殘暴，上下交征利。故所造成之傀儡漢奸無用，我統一團結愈堅，民族日益覺悟，和平空氣難成功，國際並未孤立，外援雖少而日增。</p>
<p>×人速戰速决的方針旣吿失敗，他是否有長期作戰的决心呢？卽使他國中在講紙上在寫，但决仍談不夠，而且他也不會如此，因為：</p>
<p>一，不願在中國消耗太多。</p>
<p>二，急於要消化在華所得，</p>
<p>三，經緊要準備世界大戰，企圖在此次大戰動，或開始後卽結束對華戰爭。</p>
<p>×櫃續的是速和速决的方針，這方針是速戰速决方針之繼續，不過也遭到我最高領袖之嚴詞駁斥而無法實現，于是影響×人不得不考慮其方針之改變。</p>
<p>（四）×人侵華的新政策，——卽是全面之展開，這個政策是第三階段之侵略一戰而勝中國的政策之補充輿發展，己經推翻了，第三階段之政策，而成為長期戰爭的政策。這在×人還不敢港取全面侵略，在過去四五個月在這里試行；</p>
<p>一，軍事方面，掃蕩重於進攻；</p>
<p>二，經濟方面，開展重於封鎖；</p>
<p>三，政治方面，利用挑撥兼施；</p>
<p>四，精神方面，懷　重於殘暴；</p>
<p>總之，以經營×後方為主　想利用中國的人力，物力，財力來打中國。</p>
<p>（五）×人的國際政紫——分化重於對立，</p>
<p>一，對英軟硬翁施；</p>
<p>二，對美拉　；</p>
<p>三，對蘇緩和；</p>
<p>四，對法威脅；</p>
<p>五，對德意利用策應。</p>
<p>一句話想以國際形　孤立我，東方事情都經過他,</p>
<p>六，×人的新進攻——這表現他的政策的變動性和投機性與矛盾性，</p>
<p>×人實施上述政策，不是一成不變的，因其；一，目的仍在一戰而勝中國，</p>
<p>二，中心在全面侵略；</p>
<p>三，國際形勢在急變中，激刺他投機與配合行動，</p>
<p>四，國內的意見份岐，有三種政策</p>
<p>一，停止進攻經營×後：</p>
<p>二，繼續進攻直達西南西北，</p>
<p>三，重視×後經營，同時還不玫棄進攻的互相引爭，結果採取了調和政策，於是有南昌的試玫，這其中包含了軍事佔領，政治打擊，經濟緊縮，交通切斷諸意義，估計在後×人進攻的方面：</p>
<p>二，長江流域之四個方面，</p>
<p>二，西北方面，三，西南方面，</p>
<p>估計×人進政的動態之根據：</p>
<p>一，在有利條件下——我有弱點暴露，×之捐傷不大，</p>
<p>二，在必要條件下——×認為興其全面侵略有必要：</p>
<p>三，奧德意行動配合策應，</p>
<p>四，最主要的還是×之兵力變動與增加。</p>
<p>總之，×人走一步停一步，這就暴露了×人之基本弱　——兵力不夠，以形成其政策們投機性與矛盾性因其政策雖在試行中，然其基本玫策——呑併中國獨霸東亞及侵略階段中之一戰而勝中國的政策，仍為一貫之脈胳，幷未改變，且更加深，不過這是全面侵略之展開，政治軍於軍事，因此，這其中有否關於侵絡的新階段轉變的可能，請說前途問題</p>
<p>（七）×人侵華政策之前途，</p>
<p>說前余必須先說×人之企圖及其實現的可能性如何，×人之企圖：</p>
<p>一，軍事上速戰速决——失敗了，</p>
<p>二，展的速和速决——我們拒絕了，不上當；</p>
<p>三，于是展開全面侵略——想爭取上着，爭取優勢，壓迫我們，戰勝我們（這包含大戰發生前後的猛進攻）——這總的政策，仍是一戰而勝中國卽是說這一階段仍是軍事為主，雖然已進入政治重於軍事，但仍企圖戰爭結束戰局。然而如果我們不讓他，而爭取有利於我們的時期到來，卽相持階段，以準備反攻，則×人的企圖便無法實現，今天正在這爭鬥開始時期。一般的說，×人目前這一企圖完全實現沒有可能的，條件是戰不完和不下，故戰局不會結束。但是因為這是復什的情况，復什的戰爭，有可能兩方面的，兩種可能都未完全達到而進入第二種可能卽是不戰不和局面，故實現這個局面的條件，可能有，</p>
<p>一，前綫扼住了我們交通要道，×後有相當可統治的區域？</p>
<p>二，傀儡玫權合流，甚至變一變形亦用國民政府的名義與我對立，偽軍有相當發展，</p>
<p>三，經濟上控制我們全部，及對外貿易，各國須經過他手，幷引誘我們一部分經濟漢奸輿他合流，</p>
<p>四，國際上利用各國無暇多問東亞戰爭之時機，</p>
<p>五，精神上復古並汚辱中國民挨文化，甚致三民主義來欺騙。</p>
<p>如果實現這局面，將成為日本侵華之政略的第四階段，而其政策為不戰不和正面停止進攻，專營×後地區以企圖迫我偏安，困我內地，等待世界大戰發生，可以冉戰　我，這樣但不是完全有利於我的相持局面，而是×所造成的局面，當這局面實現的可能性並不大，但主要的還决定於×我之戰爭，因此目前論×人是在展開全面侵略還不能達到預期目的，他便將轉入不戰不和之侵華政策的階段，而我們則不僅不能容許不戰不和局面到來，並且連全面侵略之展開，亦不容其有任何成功，爭取有利於我之相持局面到來，以備反攻，而埋　起日本侵華的第三階叚。</p>
<p>因此目前正處在過渡階段而×人新玫策是包含着兩種前途的，或者被我們擊敗，或者轉入新的局面。</p>
<p>總之×人的政略戰在總的路線上×人的併吞中國獨霸東亞的基本政策是冒驗的，這就是德義一樣，且因他國小人少，物產不　，歷史不長，樹×太多，失道寡助等等或為更加冒險的國策，但×人利用時機，利用我的弱點，利用國際形勢。利用他的軍事優勢，常常變動其政略與戰略，故不會一下失敗，但也不甘於失敗，且更爭取有利於他的改變</p>
<p>不過不說怎樣，他的政策及戰略均權有變動性卽不定性，矛盾性投機性，這是與其冒險的國策局歸失敗的因素，只要我們堅持抗戰到底之國策定能使×人任何企圖，任何改變歸於失敗的。</p>
<p>（一）我們方面</p>
<p>（一）中華民族解放運動三個階段。</p>
<p>一、九一八以前民族運動的與民權運動——推翻滿淸　推翻軍閥打倒帝國主義的帶手，對外是向多方面進行的：</p>
<p>二、九一八後——反日的玫治運動——統一與抗日運動走向合流——對外是專一的，但是曲折錯雜的，結果造成和平統一團結禦侮；</p>
<p>三、七七事變——統一抗戰堅持到底這個國策的限度；</p>
<p>一、日本侵略戰爭失敗了，</p>
<p>二、中華民族復興，</p>
<p>達到抗戰建國的目標建立三民主　的新中國，這個口號的具體內容正如　委員長所指示：</p>
<p>我們要確認抗戰勝利以後，所建立起的三民主議的中華民國。一定是一個後來居上的新國，是眞正的民有民治，民享而旦用以供献于世界人類福社的圾澈底的進步國家，廿八，四，十七廣播</p>
<p>（二）我們抗戰的政略與戰略</p>
<p>在抗戰到底的國策下我們的政策是</p>
<p>一，持久抗戰時間</p>
<p>二，全面抗戰——全民戰爭，空間與人民；</p>
<p>三，爭取主動——目力更生，主動外交；在此玫策下的戰略方針，</p>
<p>一，持久戰——擊破×人速戰速决，速和速結！</p>
<p>二，消耗戰——擊破×人爭取優勢爭取上着。</p>
<p>但持久戰不不拖下去，而是打下去，消耗戰不是自已亂拚，而是消　×人。（三）我們三期抗戰的政略與戰略重心，</p>
<p>一，展開全面戰爭——動員，全繼人民，動員前後方，動員全綫，使用全力，統一意志統一力量。</p>
<p>二，重視×後——政治重於軍事，精神重於物質，游擊　軍於正規　，宣傳重於作戰，民衆重於士兵，節約重於生產。</p>
<p>這是一個鬥爭，長期的鬥爭，艱難的鬥爭，針對　×人的新政策「現在是抗戰前千金一刻的時期，不容我們冉作空議空想，不容我花費一分的時光和精力」（蔣委員長四，一七，廣播「委員長為什麼這樣說，因為，「……越到接近勝利時我們的環境必然更艱難，更困苦更危險一（仝上）因此我們必須以具體的鬥爭與×人進行劇烈的抗戰，不容他的企圖實現。</p>
<p>（四）展開各與英面的鬥爭——展開全面戰爭與重視×後：</p>
<p>一，精神方面的動員——這是基本的，委員長說，「我們這一次的抗戰要擊退×人要建國成功，一大半要發揮我們民族每個份子的精神力量」（仝上）怎樣進行精神動員？委員長說「我們應當準對着當前的强×，正視國家的艱危，最重反省我們的責任，切實檢討我們一切缺點　弱點，一方面迅速砍實的來改造自身，以身作則，同時提挈着我們全國的同跑，帮助我們還沒有省悟的同胞，一致奮起改正醉生夢花自暴自棄的生活，養成奮發蓬勃積極進取的朝氣，革除茍且偷生陽奉陰違的習性，打破自私自利投降屈服的企圖，糾正份岐錯離誤國自誤的思想，緊張我們的情緒，統一我們的行動，使我們中國民挨的精脾充實起來，集中起來，眞正做到舉　二致的精神總動員，發揮這一個「至大至剛的精神力量來完成我們這一單繼往開來千載「時　使命」（仝上）</p>

<p>【中央社重慶七日電】蔣委員長於抗戰建國兩週年紀念日、對戰地民衆廣播演講、原詞如後、</p>
<p>戰地的同胞們　今天是我們抗戰建國兩週年紀念日也是第三年抗戰開始的一天、我們應該怎麼樣繼承這兩年來的光榮奮鬥、發揮一切抗戰的力量、達到我們收復失地、驅逐××和建設三民主義新中國的目的、這是全國民衆共同的任務、尤其是我們戰地的同胞、負有重大的任命、我們在戰　的同胞、受着×寇這樣重重的殘害壓迫、欺弄侮辱、過着這樣暗無天日的痛苦生活、我無時無刻不懷念、悲痛萬分、我無時無刻不在繫念　各位同胞、更無時無刻不以解除你們的痛苦引為己仔、但是各位同胞、也更要自助自救、要更英勇積極的一致起來、和全國軍民共同奮鬥、</p>
<p>戰地同胞們、過去的堅　勇敢、反抗×人的事實、我這裏都有詳　的報吿、實在使我增加無限的興奮、你們這樣的忠勇、實實在是抗戰勝利的保障、儘管×寇是樣樣的兇、但楚你們總是誓死不足、保持了我們中華民族最偉大人格、發揚了我們中華民族最高尚的道德、由於你們秤稱的奮鬥、我軍全面戰爭的功效、乃能一天天的加强、游擊區的根據、更是一天天的擴大、而鞏固我們變×後為前方」的戰絡遂得以充分發揮、這一年來、我們在×後的一切打動和佈置、已經和全面抗戰取得密切的配合、今天我們廣大的戰地、事實上已成了對×重重包圍、四面夾攻的局勢、使得×人顧此失彼、不但毫無進展、還要受到最大的死傷、這都是我們戰地同胞艱苦奮鬥的戰果、如果今後更能夠加倍努力、更奮勇做下去、就能給予×人以致命的打擊、使得×人所佔領的大小區域、都變成為大小的炸彈、在×人的肚肉裏先後爆炸起來、最後必制×人於死地、</p>
<p>兩年來抗戰的結果、的確是使「×人愈戰愈弱、我國愈戰愈强盛」了×人無論在軍事政治財政經濟交通運輸上。沒有一件不表現了困頓竭　、狀態的正因為如此所以他自己感到日暮窮途、不能不作最後</p>
<p>扎××現在的計劃、一是將用政治進攻、精神侵略的陰謀、二是在軍事上經濟上進行他門所謂建設和開發、妄想完成他所謂「以戰養戰」之毒計、這二大毒計、也是×人臨死掙扎的最後工具、我門只要打破了這兩種大毒計、就是××的死期、亦就是我們最後的勝利、</p>
<p>先說×人政治進攻以陰謀、我在去年終駁斥近衛東亞新秩序聲明中、已詳細的說明了、但居然還有無恥漢奸、喪心病狂去響應××、賣國求降、這些漢奸、已經受到全民族的唾　和制裁了。然而他的奸謀、還沒有中止的時、×人所謂懷柔政策和欺騙宣傳、也正在此時向我們戰地加緊進行、這　漢奸興×人、狼狽為奸的情形、我們要特別給折穿、老實說、×人自從東亞新秩序這一套陰謀公開以後、他已很明白的表示對我國是再無眞正的和半可言了、我們亦很明白知道×人的毒辣、他是非滅亡我們整個的國家民族和　隷我們世代子孫、决不會有實現以「東亞新秩序」夢想的可能、×人現在擬心妄想、時時刻刻要滅亡我國還恐來不及、那裏還有心思同我們中國講和平呢　（未完待續）</p>

<p>— （續昨日本版）</p>
<p>×圖速和速結失敗　收買漢奸欺騙民衆</p>
<p>在過去抗戰兩年中，軍事外交等等一切的經過，都是我們處於主動，×人幾乎是步步都隨我們所預計的而自陷于羅　和失敗之中。×人愈掙扎，愈錯悮；我們愈持久，愈堅定。其中最為重要的一件事，就是去年十二月廿二日×相近銜的聲明。自中日戰事經過一年之後，×方沒有一天不求速了戰事，但他所用的方法，幷不從徹底覺悟前非，根本放棄侵絡人手乃是因不能速戰速决，而希　速和速結。幷且要想用最陰險最卑劣的手段，用比較　去對朝鮮還要狠毒還要兇惡的辦法，根本要來徹底吞濾我們中國。他還個狡計毒課，我在當時己經有詳細的駁斥，我們軍民，必定已透澈明瞭他這一個嘗　的失敗和他的陰謀破我揭破，是×國一個最大　擊，也是×最近徬徨無計日　窮途末路的一個大關鍵。但是這一個妄念，他到如今是依然沒有打消的。他巳經揭布出來了的一東亞新秩序的口號是不能收囘的。所謂「東亞協同體」和與亞院等等的一套，是明知失敗，而不肯放棄的。×人此心未死，餘波未息，這一個運動，必然還要繼續的演下去，我們一意抗戰，本來不值冉捉，所最堪痛心的，乃居然有無恥之徒，響應這個亡華滅華的聲明，公然做背叛黨國出賣民族的行爲，雖然已經受到了舉國民意的痛斥，和國法的制裁，終不能不說是我們抗戰期間一個最大的汚點，更是多少先烈在地下不能瞑目的一個最大的遺恨。老實說，這些漢奸的所謂和平運動，實布是亡國運動。如果×人和漢奸得遂其毒謀那麼「東亞新秩序二建立之日，就是我中華民族減亡。奴隷地位確立之時。東亞協同體成功之日，就是中國實行歸併於日本之時，在×國已經宣佈「東亞新秩序「在論以後，很顯明的，他對我們中國除了要整個滅亡成爲他的奴隷以外、再沒有和平的餘地了，我們對×人，今天只有勝利，只有完全達成我們抗戰的目的；除此以外，亦絕沒有其他第二條可走的道路，否則中送投　，就是「漢奸的和平」。換句話說，便是奴隷的和平，滅亡的和平，除非存心出賣整個中國的漢妤，决沒有人再來　認這一個事實，本來在去年年底我們抗戰二期開始，內外形勢顯然好轉，勝利目標卽在眼前這些漢奸們，却要在　緊要關頭破壤抗戰，想以無恥言，欺騙民衆，動搖我們同胞對於抗戰的信念，陷害我們浴血苦鬥的將士，抹煞我們全國軍民殉國，列難無單數　尾所造成的功績，陷了本國，去解救×國。我們翻遍歷史、賢在找不出這種喪心病狂、寡廉鮮恥，忍心害理的先例。</p>
<p>實在說起來，×人宣佈這一套「東亞新秩序」，實在不僅是對中國下毒手，也無異於向世界來宣戰，無異宣佈與世界為×·×人的心中意中，何嘗有想到絲　的和平？這些漢奸們，却不想×人是已經自掘了墳來　了自己；這些漢奸們，却不顧國家，甘心為×人殉葬，這還不夠更要光榮的民族，跟着他們做殉葬品，這不是喪心病狂到了極點麼？我們全國軍民，經過這樣一個麼練，都能夠堅定一致，認清利害，明別是非，一點也沒有搖惑，這實在是我們中國在這一年中最大的成功，從此以接，前途內沒有什麼危險。我們只要立定决心，向着已經建立定勝利的目標，奮鬥邁進，可以說百里之途，已經走了九下里以上，最後勝利，已經接近，我們要以前線後方猛厲無前的撻鬥，粉碎×人和漢奸的魂捭！我們是用而肉的代價，貫徹抗戰目的，來洗雪漢奸們替我們民族所加添的恥上加恥的恥辱！不知道「漢賊不兩立」之大義的，不能算是中國人！不立志雪恥爭得國家獨立生存的，不能算是黃帝的子孫！</p>
<p>要謀子孫白世福利　毋貽民族萬世界羞辱</p>
<p>全體的將十和同胞們，必須知道；我們今天主要的一件事，是立定百折不撓的决心，和堅持抗戰勝利的信心。世上任何戰爭，都是隨着時日的延長而加深其艱難程度的，所以愈到最後，愈　要發揮更强更大的毅力和勇氣。我並不否認我們全體軍民的痛苦和努力，但是我們忍痛犧牲的决心，要隨着時日而加强，我們奮鬥的程度，要隨着戰事的延續進行而加緊，我們的痛苦和犧牲，有至高尚的價值，有極神聖的意議，我們就是要上爲祖宗保持光榮，後為下代創造幸福、現在我們這一代同胞，如果能不惜犧性，不畏痛苦，始終不屈，堅持到底，那麼，今天忍痛一時，必能換取子孫　世的　利，不然，如畏難茍安、妄想徼幸求免，那麼，我們倫安一日，就會招致民族萬年的羞辱，陷我們世代子孫，於奴隸牛馬無窮盡的痛苦，×人的千方百計，現在統統使用出來；然而我們决不怕艱難，也不怕寇息，大家要知道；艱難和危險，不是避免可了的，而只有努力去衝破的；寇仇與外患，更不是投降可以　息的，而只有奮鬥去克服的，這是我們中華民族不畏强　的固有精神，亦是我們革命軍人克敵致果應有的氣節，我們抗戰前途一天天的接觸光明同時我們的責任，亦格外加重，我們更要堅忍，更要戒懼，更要努力，更要切實反省；看我們每一個人在抗戰場上所盡的努力，是不是適合要求？是不是達到進度？在今天抗戰第三年關始的時　我們是要立定决心各就本位，而作最緊張最　實的努力，具體事項，我不必一一列舉最重要的有如下列二點</p>

<p>— 【本報特稿】　高山　（續昨日第八版）</p>
<p>四，日本國內及殖民地革命運動的發展，這種革命運動，雖在日×殘酷的壓迫之下，却已有重大的表現，在日本國內以共產黨及危害帝國之名而被捕被殺的，特別是最近以破壞經濟統制妨碍社會秩序反對總動員法令而被捕的，雖日本報紙，亦每日有之　其數字亦日益增加，至於朝鮮台灣和東北四省，則已先後成立反日統一戰線，台鮮偽滿各軍先後在各線反正，日本及各殖民地「暴亂」事件的相繼發生，更充分指出這種日本團內人民與殖民殖民衆反侵略戰爭運動，將有積極地開展！</p>
<p>五，此外，尤其嚴重的，是日本勞力的發展，和歐美列强的矛盾與衡突巳日益强烈了！去年五月强佔廈門，十月強佔廣州，今年二月强佔海南島。三月强佔新南羣島，五月在鼓浪　登陸，六月實行封鎖天津以至强佔汕頭，封鎖福州温州，更和英國實行了不宣之戰！於是英法新加坡會議開始，反侵略陣線開始延展釗遠東，日×的國際地位日益孤危了。</p>
<p>（四）兩　來的經驗和教訓</p>
<p>偉大抗戰的兩年，留給我們光榮的史績，更留給我們資貴的經騐與教訓。怎樣接受研究運用這些經騐敎訓，克服當前困難，爭取最後勝利，是我們目前最基本的任務。</p>
<p>兩年來英勇抗戰戰，首先證明了恐日病者，唯武器論者；親日派漢奸　形形式式的抗戰必亡論者是沒有根據的；我們英勇抗戰兩年來不僅沒有滅亡，反能愈戰愈奮，士　愈銳，各方而愈進步，而日×則相反的日趨崩潰之途，這些事實，便是最好的例證，同時又證明了浮　的輕率的速勝論者，也是沒有根據的；日本侵略者直到今日，尚有餘威在汕頭定海，地登陸，而且，正在覬覦福州·温州·南寧·桂林·畏沙·漢中·西安等地，便是顯明的例子。兩年來的經驗吿訴我們，我們這次抗日戰爭，是在以一個半封建半殖民地的國家的無組織無準備的力量，反抗一個現什的資本帝國主義的國家，準備了六十年的全面進攻的力量。因此要求取得最後勝利，就必須是持久的抗戰。而且要逐步的由被動的應戰爭取主動的抗戰，由軍隊與政府的抗戰進為全民族的持久的抗戰，</p>
<p>兩年來英勇抗戰更指示大家，要最後戰勝日本帝國主義，首先必須認眞切實的鞏固全民族的團結，必須　眞切實的動員全民族一切生動和物質的力量。正因為自從「七七」以後，我國各黨派各階級漢蒙囘藏與少數民族形成空前的團結，才能克服一切×人漢奸汪逆×　的挑發離間妥協出賣，才能堅决支持長期抗戰而且取得「出×意表」的勝利，以至於兩年之久，也正因為全民族一切人民生動興　質力量總動員協助抗戰的主張與政策，獲得全國的熱烈　護興忠實執行，才能夠以無組織的無準備的力量、倉猝以應戰，而在戰鬥中補充　備組織起來，以全於堅持了兩年之久，力量反而日趨壯大起來，每一個眞正愛護祖國愛護民族之獨立自由的同胞，當未有不深深認識，鞏固全民族團結的以國共合作為基幹的抗日民埃統一戰線是中華民族保衛領士主權爭取生存獨立自由幸福的生命線，維護這條生命線，是每一個不願做奴隸的中國人的中心任務！</p>
<p>兩年來英勇抗戰，又指示不大家：改革各級政治機　，改善全國動員方法，切實推進民主政治，認眞改良民衆生活，是促使政治軍隊與民衆實現三位一體的基本條件是鞏固與　大全民族團結的抗日民族統一戰綫和動員全民族一切生動的物質的力量的基本條件也是最後戰勝日本强×建立三民主義共和國的基本條件。我們在兩年來巳經開始實施了這個條件　所以能夠克服一切困難支持兩年之久；也因為我們實施的還不切　還，不澈底還不　　　，所以我們在兩年來不　軍隊以　　　，　　　受了不必要的慘酷的犧牲或　　。</p>
<p>兩年來英勇抗戰，還指示大家：非建立現代化的機械化的國防軍，非培　成千整萬的支持抗戰　國政策　的新的幹部，非在自力更生的愿　　之力爭更廣大更切實的外　，則我們將不可　準備及進行未來的總反攻總决戰，則我們將不可能消減及　　日本強×出中個，則我們將不可能建設獨立自由平等幸福的三民主義的共印國，同時又指示大家：雖然我們　力於上述一切的實現，如果我們不　力設法　　日本強×的困難如，果不從日本强×的軍隊內國內和國際增加他的困難與危機，如果不趕快在×人的後方廣大的發展游擊隊　擊區和抗日根據地。去和×人進行軍事的政治的經濟的文化的殊死的「爭，特別是：如果我們不去堅决的　底　打擊漢奸×探×　汪逆，不去打擊她們　反共，和平一等　　言論，不去打擊她們分化分裂我們統一戰線動搖我國持久，戰情緒的行動，不去打擊他們，鞏固漢好政權利用中國人力物力　　以征服中國」的陰謀活動，那麼，我們的抗，我們中華民族的解放鬥爭，是還會遭受極大打擊的。</p>

<p>日×汪逆現在已經高舉『反共』『和平」的　旗，高舉出什麼「反共國民黨」『反共國民黨政府』等招魂旗了！而一般在政冶上失去自尊心自信心的喪心病狂之徒，意也『如饗新　』的在們言，在跳躍，在作惡了—這些數類的臬甘殉葬，原不足惜，但是，誠如蔣委員長昨天訓詞中所指出，他們　更要把光榮的民埃　他來做殉葬品」—這却是我們全民族所不能容忍的—我們要更堅强的團結起來，在蔣委員長的領導之下　給日×漢奸和少數喪心病狂的無恥之奴以堅决的××！</p>

<h3 id="c32">存欵中 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>我是一個糊涂蛋</p>
<p>我走進銀行時，口吃起來了。銀行員叫我口吃，櫃台上的小窗口叫我口吃，看見錢叫我口吃，一切都叫我口吃。</p>
<p>當我跨進銀行的門檻，要去辦理存銀的事務那一剎那，我養成一個神志糊塗的獃子了。</p>
<p>這，我在事前就曉得了。不過我的薪金，已經加到每個月五十塊錢，我覺得祇　存在銀行里。</p>
<p>於是我就踉蹌進去，怯懦地向週遭的銀行員看着。我想一個新俘戶要到銀行裏去存欵。必須跟經理談談。</p>
<p>我走到一個註明「會計員」的櫃合小窗口前。那會計員是一位態度冷淡的高個子，我看見他就口吃起來了，我的聲音好悽愴。</p>
<p>「我可以見，見經理嗎？」我說。</p>
<p>「可以可以。」那會計員說着，便請經理來。</p>
<p>經理是一個嚴粛沉靜的人。我把袋裏的五十六元鈔票抓成一粒球。</p>
<p>「你可是經理？」我說。天曉得，我是不是在懷疑。</p>
<p>「是。」他說。</p>
<p>「我可能見你，」我問道，「單獨地？」</p>
<p>經理覺得有點驚奇地望着我，他覺得我要揭露一件大秘密。</p>
<p>『請進來』他說着，把我領到一間密室去，他把門上的　鎖上。</p>
<p>『我們現在不會受驚擾了，』他說『請坐。』</p>
<p>我們　都坐下，彼此對望着，我覺得說不出話來。</p>
<p>『你是偵探局派來的偵樑吧，我想，』他說。</p>
<p>他看見我那種神秘的態度，以為我是偵探。我曉得他想的是甚麼，這把事情弄得更糟了。</p>
<p>「不，我不是偵探。」我說。</p>
<p>一老實說，」我繼續下去，似乎故意要說謊似的，「我不是偵探。我是來存欵，我想把我所有的金錢全存在這銀行裏。」</p>
<p>經理好像安心一點。可是還是很嚴肅；他現在想我大概總是甚麼百萬富翁的子　了。</p>
<p>「是一筆很大的欵子吧，我想」，他說，</p>
<p>『不少，』我輕輕地說。『我現在想要先存五十六塊錢，以後每個月存五十塊錢。』</p>
<p>經理站了起來，把門開了。他叫會計員來。</p>
<p>『蒙高茂莢先生，』他眞殘忍，大聲說了出來，『這位先生要來存錢，他要存五十六塊錢。早安。』我站了起來。</p>
<p>『早安』我說着，踏進保　　裏去。</p>
<p>『出來，』經理冷淡地說，指着鬥叫我出去。</p>
<p>我走到會計員櫃台上的小窗口前，以一種袖動的動作，把那粒鈔票球很快地推給他，像　戲法似的。我的臉灰白得像鬼一樣。</p>
<p>『唔，』我說，『存進去。』我的語氣好像是說，『快點把這件痛心的事情辦完吧。』</p>
<p>他把錢拿去，傳給另外一位行員。</p>
<p>他叫我在一張紙條上寫上銀數，叫我簽名在一本簿子上。我再也不曉得我在幹甚麼了。銀行在我眼前轉　。</p>
<p>「存好了嗎？」我以一稱空虛而顫慄的聲調問道。</p>
<p>「存好了，」會計員說。</p>
<p>「那麼我要寫張支票。」</p>
<p>我的意思是要先支六塊錢出來用，有個行員把一本支票簿給我。另外一個行員開始敎我怎樣簽法。他們一定在想，以為我是一個不中用的百萬富翁。我在支票上寫了一些字，把支票推給銀行員。他拿支票起來看。</p>
<p>「甚麼！你又要全支出去了嗎？」他驚異地問。這時我才曉得我把六　寫五十六了。現在我再也不能想了，我覺得這件事是無法解釋的，所有的銀行員都停下筆來看我了。</p>
<p>這時我痛苦得不顧顧一切了，便突然說出：</p>
<p>「全部那支出來。」</p>
<p>「你要收囘存在銀行裏的款子嗎？」</p>
<p>「每一分錢都要收囘</p>
<p>『你不再存了嗎？』行員驚異地說。</p>
<p>「永不再存了。」</p>
<p>這時我有一種痴想希望他們以為我在簽支票時，有甚麼事侮辱我叫我不再存　。我拚命想　出一個很急性的人的模樣。</p>
<p>行員預備要付欵了。</p>
<p>「你要甚麼票子呢？」他說。</p>
<p>『甚麼？』</p>
<p>『你要甚麼票子呢？</p>
<p>『唔』——我曉得他的意思了，一點也不想地就囘答說——「五十塊一張的。』</p>
<p>『小姐，我不能吿訴你什麼，我在球上看明白，你的提袋裏忘記了放錢。』</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，趁德輪去遊歷歐洲，因為英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。好容易她逃出虎口，囘到美境，傑克與比爾便囘紐約去，見到邱。邱又叫他們趁一聖瑪克號」去歐洲找他的兒子，在船上，傑克不肯替一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報，原來那像伙就是叫拉維基的德國間×……</p>
<p>十三　着火的船</p>
<p>「倒底是為甚麼？」比爾接着問。</p>
<p>「哦，他跑來；允許我許多錢，叫我替他發密碼消息我想像起來，這是關於，　泰尼號」一的報吿說她在那處地方。」</p>
<p>「這就是他要的把戲嗎？」</p>
<p>「對，他沒弄成，我一時糊塗，吿訴了他，叫他不用在我面前裝假，幷且，要是他再來麻煩我，在以後第一個英國檢查員上船，我就要指發他啦。」</p>
<p>「就這末，他又怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「我想，那時候，他漲得像氣球啦，」傑寬笑着，『現在　只要我們能揭穿　史可志，等我們要他的時候，就可以一網打下了。』</p>
<p>「這到不容易，他们總不在一塊兒，至少，我留神看着？拉維基在這船上，從沒有和誰交談過，</p>
<p>「不，我猜，他們故意避開着怕人起疑，我要是在那天晚上，聽到他們說話，再能着上他一眼，多好。」</p>
<p>『是啊，那是最簡單，而又好的事，但是，像你那樣說，我想，他們誰也不致於再來　擾了。』</p>
<p>這天過得不很平靜，在下午，他們　見一艘英國貨船，向西航去，以後，又追上上條法國載油的船，，正向波蘭境駛行。傑克因為見她們裝置一具小無線電收發機，就去問最近的消息囘話說，在隣近有兩條德國巡洋艦，法國船正在逃避，恐怕被俘。</p>
<p>這天黃昏時，風吹得大了些。海浪也被吹高了「聖瑪克號」，這樣的大船，也顚播，搖　得很利害。這正是，航海家所稱為『新鮮的和風』。但是，對於這些不慣此道的旅客們，就算得是了不起的風浪了。</p>
<p>傑克和比　，都高興，在這樣單　的風平浪靜之下，寧願來點惡劣的氣候。晚飯後，他們到放小艇的甲板上，上下的走　，口　隨意的談天說地。裏面，無線電礎上，馬倫正管着，他們，來來去去，走過門口時，也和他胡亂搭幾和句話。二次，馬倫與奮的叫住了他們。</p>
<p>「有一條船，發求救的無線電！」他喊着。</p>
<p>『英國船？』傑克叫着『可是，在這樣的一個衣里，有什麼危險？』</p>
<p>「現在，還不知道，我試　俘聽下去，你去報吿船長，去不去　　？」</p>
<p>「馬上去！」傑克，幾分鐘　將他的差事趕了。囘到無綫電室。帶來的命令是：『援救！』並且快等以下的報吿。</p>

<h3 id="c41">文學兩年間 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>從一九三七年的七月七日到今天，我們的祖國是已經麼過了整整兩年的戰鬥，兩年以來，伴隨着祖國底現實的鬥爭，伴隨着祖國之偉大戰鬥　進，我們的文學也已經非常有力地肩負了時代與國家所交給它的使命，為了從愚魯之中喚起千萬的大衆，為了在自身的基本崗位上來打擊×人，它堅决地投入於偉大的戰鬥游渦中，利用它自身的各種武器，集中着它自身周圍的各種鬥士，從而執行其艱苦偉大的鬥爭；自從五四新文化啟蒙運動開始以後，十除平來在文學上底一貫的鬥爭路向，在這裏獲得了一個新的發展，新的昂揚，各方面的文學鬥爭，是大大的提高了，進步了，而且也比較從前的各階段獲得超著的成功，獲得異常的擴大，中國新興的戰鬥文學，在這一全新的戰鬥時代中，大大地向前跨進了一步。</p>
<p>新中國自由的天空中招展着鮮艷的戰旗是那麼有力的號召　文學陣營中的各式　樣的戰士，兩年來在文學的鬥爭上，我們全體的文學戰士就在這偉大的戰旗之下　集起來，完成了一條比較鋼鐵更堅强更鞏固的民族革命文學統一陣綫，吸收了全　作家，詩人，理論家，戲劇家以及廣大的文藝靑年，共同向一個目標而戰鬥，作　　一個民族革命文學統一陣綫　基礎的戰鬥口號和基本的創作標幟的，就是「抗戰文　」，它，以一種矯健的瓷態引領着兩年以來的文藝的鬥爭，　成了一切文藝工作人員底工作的路標，變　了今口的文藝運動底最最現實的途徑，抗戰文藝運動，這已經成為兩年以來我們　國文化的鬥爭之最有力的一這。</p>
<p>抗戰文藝運運是過去的各時代中國文學底鬥爭經驗之批判的成果，是「一二九」北平學生運動以後「七七」以前　一國防文學、和「民族革命戰爭的大衆文學」少鬥爭的延長，是它們底理論的凈化與現實的深化，換句話說，也就是中國文學之一更高的更新的階段，兩年以來現實的戰鬥底日益激烈需來了文學的戰鬥底不斷向前，抗戰文　運動在各方面上都有了　　　　　發展，有了許多存文學歷史上空前納收　，無論在文藝的創作上　文藝的理論上。詩歌上，或是說在內容上，手法上，形式上，大衆化與中國化上，我們兩年來所積　的戰鬥成績實在是不勝縷述的，而我們所獲得了的進步，也决不是三言兩語所可能表達出來的。</p>
<p>抗戰文藝運動的發展，也正如其他一切文藝運動的發展一樣，是需要它的理論指導的，兩年來　抗戰文藝底新進的理論，就有機地指導着它，引領着這個運動走上發展的正軌，指導一切站在這個運動前頭的作家以創作的方向，因此，抗戰文藝理論在過去兩年間的抗戰文藝運動中是扮演着一個重大的角色，雖然它本身的活動還是十分微弱，雖然比起現實的進展與創作的實　來，它還顯出了大大的落後，但是它卻也做下了很多的工作，比如抗戰文藝的理論之各方面的發揚，創作路綫之各方面的批判檢討，基本的理論觀點之　釋，公式主義形式主義的淸算，文藝大衆化的　論底深化，作家寫作範圍的擴展，地方文學底批判與攝取等各方面，都有了很大的貢獻，當然，單單是這些　是不夠的，兩年以來深刻化擴大化了的鬥爭，已經不能單單滿足這些理論，這些瑣　的理論事實上也已不能適應於今日文學戰鬥的需要，所以，從這兩年間所獲得的成果再向前踏進一步，我們需要建立一個體系的文學理論，建立一個完整的文學創作與批評的中心方法，需要更加精進，更加完密的理論。</p>
<p>過去兩年我們文學的鬥爭之主要的一環，無疑是在於文學創作方而，由于現實戰鬥的需要，我們的創作是巳經展開了無限廣泛的諸方面在描寫正面的戰鬥的，我們產生了「一個連長的戰鬥遭遇」，在描寫負面的朽壞的，我們產生了「華威先生」，各式各樣的小册子，小說，詩歌和劇本等等，是像雨後春筍一般地蓬勃發展起來，「差半車麥稻」，「一年間」，「塞上風雲」……這些優秀的作品，是不斷的被發現出來，所有這一切的創作成果，都是以顯示我們兩年以來文學上所進行了的偉大的爭鬥，難然這些們爭在現實的飛速發展底過辟中，是　得有點落後的，但是更為機敏，更為精銳的文藝創作，今後無疑仍將要大量地產生出來，過去兩年文學上的鬥爭是已替我們今後的抗戰文藝創作很好的開拓了它的道路，繼承着這一道路的發展，我們應該更有力的强化我們文家創作的鬥爭，把我們的文藝的鏡子朝向於民族解放的鬥爭以及這一鬥爭之勝利的明日。</p>
<p>文藝大衆化通　化的工作，無疑也是我們過去兩年來所執行了的重大工作之一，這一工作，我們今日已經看到很多的成果，比方許多地方性的戲曲，鼓詞，說書之類的改製民謠兒歌之類「舊瓶裝新酒都是一些很好的例子，今後我們的這一工作，必需予以更加擴大，更加提高，更加深入，澈底的從大衆化之中提煉文學之精華，建底立一種完全大衆化中國化底新型的文學，藉以加强其戰鬥的機能。</p>

<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>文藝戰線二三號連載</p>
<p>『陳二石頭』被按上上個「講演文學」的名目，的確是「一篇新鮮的東西」。　一為了避免一切物質條件上的限制，而利用說故事的　形式，乃是文藝大衆化或通俗化的一枝輕騎隊，這種形式由於對民衆親切易解，必將為極多的識字或不識字的羣衆所接受，（因為它是演講的，不識字人也可以領略到好處，）我們分析它的內容等等，除了文學上的評價外，尤應着重它的効果，因為這芷是它承襲　形式而來的惟一「遺產」．</p>
<p>在寫作過程中，胡攷先生無疑　　了很大的力氣，顧慮的地方太多，口頭語的不夠用，像（一喉」，「吶」等都是他自個兒發明的，）以及筆調需要活潑輕鬆才便於講演，便於吸引羣衆等許多地方，都是很顯明的；現在單就創造這一種一講演文學」的形式而論，可以說已有相當的成就，有頭有尾，有可以大笑一場的噱頭，有一點也不含糊的民間熟悉的生活經騐有活龍活現的口頭詞兒，結果也還達到了說這個故事的並非傳奇化了的主題和收場——陳二石頭被鬼子把家燒燬了，妻女炸死了，從莊稼人轉向一幹隊伍」的游擊中間去，結束了這個故事。</p>
<p>此長達二萬餘字的全文，正如普通講故事的一般，一根線到底，絲　沒有一些「曲筆」，卽使小核子們也不致張開嘴茫然無知，為了加强語氣起見，往往不惜重複字句來達到目的，這也是普通說故事者所慣用的手法，像其中一段：　（未完）珠江</p>
<h3 id="c44">從「文章義賣」說起 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 珠江</p>
<p>本刊自本月八日起，至本月十日止，響應「文協」文章義賣献金運動，所有稿費，皆捐作救護傷兵之用，這個運動有兩重意義：其一，是表示作家們的踴躍捐輸；其二，是表示筆桿與槍桿的請誠合作。</p>
<p>自七七抗戰以來，有一句最　行而又最切要的話，那就是「有力出力］有錢了出錢」。我們的最高領袖　屢次向國民剴切闡明：「這次中日的戰爭，是兩國人力，財力，物力的總决賽，如果我們在人力，財力，物力有支持較久的力量我們就能獲得勝利。」這所謂人力，是將勞力和心力都包括在內的。作家們所出的力，自然是一種心力。現在作家們買戲出心力，寫出有利於抗戰建國的文章、又將這文章所應得的代價——稿費献出。作為救護傷兵之用，這可以說是旣出了人力又出了財力的。所以這個文章義賣渾動是很可以表示出作家們的愛國精神，將『有力出力，有錢出錢」的一句話全部做到了。</p>
<p>其次這次文章義賣運動有着更深刻的意義，那就是表現筆桿輿槍　的精誠合作。在前線馳騁彊場，打擊殘敵，這是槍桿的使命；在後方鼓吹民氣，支持抗戰，這那是筆桿的任務，所以槍桿和筆桿，在抗戰中各有其崗位，現在將　桿的所得——　費——消作救護傷兵之用，使傷兵的元氣能平日復原，重執槍桿，與×人拚命。這不是用筆桿去支持槍桿，表現出筆桿與搶桿的精誠合作嗎？</p>
<p>末了，我以為作家們在這個文章義賣運動當中，更應澈底的　識到自己任務的重大，來鄭重地執行本身的工作。現在憑我所想得到的，提供下列幾點意見：</p>
<p>第一是要擈減漢好理論，自從汪派叛黨叛國以來，國內頗發現些博播漢奸理論的報紙和出版物。這對于抗戰底國前途，不無有不利的影響。我以為作家們一方面應針對着漢奸的理論加以致命的攻擊；一方面要對抗戰必勝建國必成的道理，加以詳細的　發，以堅定國民的信心。</p>
<p>第二要具有殺肅的寫作態度，風花雪月的文章，大可以不寫，這理由是很顯明的，這個時代絕不是寫風花雪月的文章，在作家們說，是將心力誤用到無甩的甚或有審的地方去；在讀者們說，是耗費了他們的精神，甚或頹喪了他們的意志。所以在抗戰建國的過程中，寫這類的文章，無論在作者和讀者方面來看，或是站在國家民族的立場上來看，都是一件有害的工作。這是一般抱着游戲的態度去寫作的作家們所應猛省的。</p>
<p>第三寫作的範圍要多方面的，目前的作家們，大半的題材都是集中於『抗戰』，這似乎狹窄一點。在前年發動的『七七』，一方面自然是「抗戰」的開始；一方面更是『建國』的開始，這『建國』是永遠的事業，同時又須從多方面去進行。政治的，經濟的，敎育的，科學的……改進，都包括在內。所以我們對於與建國有關的一切社會科學自然科學都應加以詳細的研究與闡述，單單寫「抗戰」的題材我　為仍然是不等的。我希望作家們多從其他各方面去努力。</p>

<p>— 拉特</p>
<p>由文化事業社所發動號召下　九龍各社團學校，也跟其他區域的社團一樣。帶着如火如荼的心情，如浪如潮的心海，對着這抗戰建國二週年紀念日發出了他們壯烈的吼聲發掦了他們忠於祖國的精神，</p>
<p>成羣成隊的靑年男女們，像千兵萬馬的　騰一榭向着九龍塘學校運動密集來了，這一個廣場四圍都矗立着靑葱的青年，場上鋪滿着茸茸的綠草；不遠的距離也明現着一排一耕的靑山綠嶺？場　他　史有華麗的洋房聳立着，　是原野上　立的鶴羣，這裏找不到什麽閒雜人等的往來，大可說是幽雅淸秀的勝景。但當着無數人們破天荒的在此騷鬧高呼的時節，便衝破了它從來那山野般的沉悶氣象，而永遠留下了紀念民族的光榮戰鬥的痕跡。</p>
<p>似火燃燒的太陽正放射出他的萬道金光照在廣場上面，顯出了熱辣辣的氣息。人們在這熱辣辣的氣息裏　着胸膛。昂若頭顱，露着肌　都是爲了爭若國家民族一口氣。</p>
<p>大約是在上點鎇的光景，鈴聲響了，奏　的也叫號了，會幕正一節一節的揭開。講台上的主席團和來　都先後的爭說着他們那擁議　高領袖，擁護統一陣線，堅持抗戰，反對主和的言語主張，歌詠隊也同樣的以嘹亮的音喉感應了全場，這些滿額汗珠的靑年大衆，然而許多體質　弱的小朋友們，經不起太陽的過火的　炙都昏倒下來了，他們正像受了傷的小戰士一樣，由半島護十隊非常忙碌的援救他們，好容易的就恢復了他們的神態。</p>
<p>當講演歌唱的節目結束了之後，一個更加嚴粛的儀式又開始了。是向着前方死難將士公祭的儀式。首先鳴了炮，奏了哀樂，献了花圈，再由主席讀着祭文。一連中的　壯的音波，哀的而又是激勵興奮的語詞都深深的打進了每一個人　心璽，最後　中學校歌詠隊的一位小朋友叫做梁偉文的那「蘆溝橋之歌」的獨唱，他的　　的清　與嘹亮，他的音波的抑楊與明晣，使整個會場的周圍馬上產生了一道喜悅的氣流，這正是中華民族的優秀兒女們的唯一標幟，是中華民族不可勝算的新生力量的正在養成。</p>
<p>在那廣場上的會幕結束了之後，人們又成羣成隊一點也不感到疲勞，而跟着　陽爭雄似的在馬路上一步一步的前進，又像是遠征一樣向着油麻地第一戲院來舉行着「七七」午餐素吃大會。會堂坐滿了人羣。一碗一碗的蕃薯芥菜湯，由許多招待員們汗流夾背的捧着奉給人們喝着吃若。是比吃雞吃肉更有意趣的會　。沒有兩週年的堅决的抗戰，决不會有這天的素吃大會，共同笑嘻嘻的喝吃，但也是因爲人們有這樣如火如荼的心情來寫出這一頁光輝的史詩，才體現了中華民族之更大有　。</p>
<p>素吃完了之後，作爲靑年戲劇界的優秀之花的靑年同　社的戲劇團。又擺設着他們的陣容，　起了戰鬥藝術的號角，表演了一齣「不願做順民一的獨幕劇。這一獨　劇的　出，增光了全場嚴肅緊張活潑的氣流，更鼓舞了正恨在×殺×的人們的心火，雖然短短的劇情，然而由於表演者的言語動作如風雨交作，如雷電交鳴那緊張情態的活現，它所收的效果都在任足以把握着這天戰一七七一週年紀念的重大意義的一角，這一幕劇的中心內容就在不願做順民而要繼續殺×的情卽表演下，打動了會埸觀衆的心胸，收到了藝術宣傳的效果。</p>
<p>下午三點鐘的光景。散會了，人們又帶喜笑楊眉的踏着各人的歸途，帶去了這天欣慰的，喜悅的，同時也是光榮的果實。</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>站在一條戰線上的香港靑年文化工作者——『靑記』，『文協』，『中藝』，昨天上午九時聯合假座中央戲院舉行紀念會。用緊密的團結，緊密的合作的姿熊來迎接這個神聖的民族解放來臨。</p>
<p>時候一分一秒地溜走，在大家熱切的祈待當中，這位民放革命的鬥士的王冷齋先生終於來到了。主席許地山和　地。『起立，說出今天的開會理由；』今天這個紀念會，更得到了發出抗戰第一炮的英雄，兩年前在宛平城舉起民族解放鬥　的旗號的王冷齋先生演述他英勇的故事　是很難得的。經過　又女先生的介紹在掌聲中。王冷　先生站起來了，他這天穿着白絨的西服，白的皮鞋，配合起他那淸癯而方長的　，上唇的兩撮鬍子　態度瀟瀟，假如　遝沒有看見他一雙神威而有力的眼睛的時候。你一琯會相信他是一個學者，他說話溫婉而懇摯，剛毅嚴正的氣慨，溢於言表。</p>
<p>在演說的開頭，他說得非常慢，而且常常作小的間歇，露着威　的光芒的眼睛，往前直射，他好像在囘溯　兩年前的今天，舉起民解放戰爭的火把的光榮和偉大的歷程，在出乎×人意料之外的兩年前的今日，他竟能够向×人進攻，燃撓起抗戰的怒火，現在全中華民族都躡着他那英勇的足跡前進進踏上勝利之途，這種民族革命鬥士創造出來的榮耀，將要繼續　世世代代的。　着先，他說出：『兩年前的今天。×人　一咆打進宛平城的縣政機關。　了一個小小的房子，不　竟因爲這一炮而燃起了中華民族解放爭鬥的怒火。在今天。我相信全國各地一致舉行這個紀念會，大家都培滿腔烈火的，這種火燄，一直燃燒到中華民族光輝燦　　已。』</p>
<p>繼續他很詳細說出「×人呑滅了整閱中國的陰謀，因了×人在蘆溝橋的跋扈囂張，史誣說日兵失蹤而藉端　　，提出種種無理要求。　　們　絕了，於是衝突便起，×人首先發　和開鎗向我們掃　了將來的展　的結果怎樣，還不可預料，但是當時實在容忍不仕而要起來抵抗了。」說到這里，他的聲音說得格外沉重，仿彿把兩年前堅决的態度到拿出來了。</p>
<p>跟着他說出「×人的欺　的訛詐，簡直是走界上最狡猾而又最沒有信義的人、抗戰到現在兩年了，×人雖然因爲人力。財力，物力的竭蹶，然而他們跋扈的軍閥，還是自詡勝利以自傲的。他那里會和我們言和，他之放播和平空氣是有作用的，第一是　淆亂世界的視聽。第二是分化國內的團結，第三景鬆懈大家决心，第四是想鬆懈我們的軍備。好條兩年前的蘆溝橋事變一樣，所以我們大家都不要上他的當。</p>
<p>「我們不要做亡國奴。更不要做漢奸，做了漢奸比叫化子還痛苦，還不自由！」他用警惕的口吻說。</p>
<p>「我們大家一致起來，擁護我們的最髙領袖，復興民族，搶囘來我們已失去的河山！」掌聲熱烈地送他坐下來。</p>
<p>着通過××蔣委員長及前方將士致敎，大家熱烈鼓掌，跟着是中華合唱團表演救亡歌詠，抗×歌，遊擊隊，歌八百壯士，「中國不會亡！中國不會亡！」不會亡！不會亡！不會亡！的歌鑿響澈雲霄，大家都感到熱血奔流。</p>
<p>「中藝」殿尾的「曙光」一劇，非常精采，緊凑　嚴粛的情緒，充滿場中。使人感奮的流下淚來！</p>

<h3 id="c56">蔣委長告日本人民書　宣佈日本狂妄軍閥之罪狀 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— （昨第二版）</p>
<p>你們來侵略，當然抗日，就認你們日本是×人。你們如放棄侵略，而　于和好，也常然可以認你們日本是朋友，這不是顯然之理，至於別造一親日政府，試問大中華民國的政府，豈容×國軍隊偽造？你們軍部在占領國內，固然可以招致極少數中國漢奸敗類，組織一些傀儡機關；但這些機關。總之是你們侵略軍的附屬機關，而不是獨立的政治機關，你們軍部無論怎樣粉飾欺瞞我全國人民，總之，要認定機關屬於×人，而儡傀是叛逆，所以只　以欺編日本人，而欺騙不了中國人。</p>
<p>抗戰是中國全民族的意志</p>
<p>最後說到我個人，我也知道你們　閥曾集矢於我這本來是當然之事。因爲旣然要征服中國國家，當然仇恨中國統帥，所以此事，並不需多論。不過奉勸你們，千萬勿以爲打倒　某。便能打倒中國，這是絕對錯誤的。　記得幾年前你們　閥　曾散布小册子，說『蔣某是帝國大陸政策的最大障碍』，不錯，我對于侵略中國者，確是全力抵抗，爲　障碍。但你們必須認識，中國民族，實在能團結，實在有人才，我負責統軍是這樣堅决抗戰，將來另換一個人，甚至　換一百　人統軍，也是這樣堅決抗戰。你們必須知道：中華民國的偉大前途是頓無量數的忠勇軍民爲其保障，而决不是只靠少數在領導地位的人去支撑！我又來吿訴你們：我對于我們國家民族的的途，實在充滿了感激的樂觀，因爲經過兩年艱苦抗戰的鍛鍊陶鎔，凡我們前綫上的每一官兵，及各地每一個抗戰工作之人，其精神大都達到道德的極峯。老實說，我本人在今天只可以說是能够代表全軍官兵與全體各界民衆的精神意志，以執行偉大的抗戰　國的任務，而同時十分相信，我們無量數的後起人才，將來在任何意義上，必比現時負責。所以，你們日本民衆，務須認識中國民族的偉大，不要看錯了問題。</p>
<p>（二）宣佈日本軍閥奴隸　東亞民族的罪惡</p>
<p>以上所說，大槪把幾種欺騙宣傳的眞相揭破了，但是還不够，因爲那麽宣傳，日本民衆也有不少的人知道是假話。但是另外容易相信一點，就是「日本事實上能征服中國，能打倒中國的獨立」，一般日本民衆，也知道侵略不好，但以為無論如何，總之能支配中國，能佔領大陸，總是與日本有利的。你們經過兩年侵略戰爭之後，這種迷夢，大槪已醒了不少，但是還不澈底—所以我認爲必須給你們道破兩點：一點是你們軍閥的侵略，必定失敗；我們的自衛必定成功。</p>
<p>叉一點是我們的成功，决不是你們日本的失敗，而你們軍閥政策的失收　才是你們民衆的成功。這個理由，需要許多的話來解釋。我現在先說明基本的一點，就是你們國家受軍閥錯誤思想的指導導，對于東亞民族，一貫的犯了重大罪惡，這是此次侵華戰爭必然失敗的根本原因。而你們日本民衆，現花正開始身受其報。這種囘報，要發展到甚麼程度呢？現在是不能預料的。日軍關認識之淺薄可笑</p>
<p>們軍閥　想的嚴重錯誤是特別賤視隣近的東亞民族。你們自明治　新以後，國運進步，因而忘了幾千年的歷史，而妄自尊大，　視落後的隣國，這種思想，特別由軍閥提倡鼓勵因而麻醉了人民，造成了武力萬能侵咯萬能的想想。實在說來這是你們最大的不幸！我可以吿訴你們關於此點，中國與日本絕對不同，你們受軍閥錯誤的指導　凡事只　強弱，不講是非，你們看外國，完全用武裝强弱計算，對於最强者最表敬意，次强者敬意亦次之，對於弱者就打算欺　了，而對於無武裝者，就想一口界下去。這因爲你們執　的軍閥，論天下事，完全講武力。他們整天的計算，誰有多少大砲，多少飛機，多少軍艦，多少軍需工業與資源。他們着每一國家民族的價値，完全用武大的量做代表，在你們軍閥的心中，凡武力弱的民族，都應當臣服强者；若是全無武裝的民族，就不算是人類，就應當做奴才，這楚你們軍閥的基本哲學。而因爲世界太大了，遠處的弱小國家，日本的力量達不到，所以日本統治階級的征服慾只有先向近隣的弱者發揮，東亞的悲劇，就是這樣發展起來的。關於此點，中國忠想，根本不同。我們心目中，凡民族　是平等的，都應當是自由的，　如說，日本人和朝鮮人，其强弱與榮枯之　，眞是天淵之別了，但是我們看來，都是平等的　人。我們不能因爲日本　所謂一等强國，而怕日本人，同時也不能因爲朝鮮人是弱國之民，而看不起朝鮮人。相反的，我們正是痛惡武力萬能的侵略者，而十分同情於被壓迫的强小民族，簡單說，日本　講強弱，而我們專論是非，這一點是很重要的。</p>
<p>鐵蹄下的朝鮮臺灣人民</p>
<p>現在讓我宣布你們軍閥的罪惡罷！你們撕毀了與中國所訂尊重朝鮮獨立的誓約，而呑滅了朝鮮。三十年來，我們固然無力顧問，也無　過問，但冷眼旁觀你們國家至今賤視朝鮮人如乞丐，不　一點政治自由，而在商業上逐漸鯨吞　食，使　鮮富翁成了貧戶，普通人民陷于流亡，十多年來朝鮮人民紛紛逃入我東三省謀生，還都是在故鄉失了田產被迫流亡的，又有多少無業鮮人，被逼在平津及他處販私，無惡不作我們雖痛惡其行爲，却不能不同情其境遇，至于朝鮮境內之奴化敎育與嚴厲的壓制政策，都不用詳說了。總之一句話，朝鮮人民是在奴隸的境遇，台　情形也是如此，而你們　閥　奴隸了朝鮮臺灣，進一步要奴隷大中華民族，其第一階段，就是佔領我東四省。</p>
<p>東北同胞之慘痛遭遇</p>
<p>你們有知識的日本民衆可以小心靜氣看看我們東四省人民八年以來　底怎樣生活　？總括言之政治上，你們關東軍操着生殺與奪的專制威權，我們同胞只有服從，不能說話，經濟上，中國人的大商業，全被侵占了，農民土地也許多被沒收了，我們同胞貿易生產居住交通的一切，在法律上的自由，完全喪失凈盡，更說不到政治權與敎育權，這八年來，不知任意殺害了我們多少良民其最慘酷者，可以沒有原因，單憑喜怒而殺人，而稱之曰思想腐化。簡單說只因爲樣子不順眼，就應當叫他們死。說到敎育！更寒心了，你們大和民族的祖先，在過去二千餘年，曾經熱讀中國歷史，而得到不少的敎訓或經驗，現在你們軍閥即要求我們東北人民忘了中國歷史，這是　　的一種報答呢？總之一句話，你們軍閥，完全把我們東北人民，沒有看做應該平等生存的人類，完全看做下賤該死的奴隷，現在只要他們做苦力服勞役，將來要使得他們越貧越愚，最後摧殘壓迫到　于自己消滅。</p>
<p>日軍閥的毒辣征服政策</p>
<p>你們軍閥奴隸東亞民族的罪惡，若詳叙起來，十萬言也不能盡。但我以爲不必詳叙了，因為　信有知識的日本民衆，其所知者，一定比我們更多，更深之故，現在我只說明一要點，就是這種極端惡劣的征服政策對于各民族有甚麽結果？對于日本已身，有甚麽影響？先從第一部分說，其可能　結果，確是十分可怕。因為這種政策，其目的不僅在滅國家，幷且要滅民族，換句話，就是雖甘做亡國之民，也不能生存下去。一個民族的生存，其最基本的要素，是經濟的自由；日本軍閥的政策，却芷在消減被壓迪民族的經濟目由，以我東北人民說，照這樣下去，再若干年後，就完全苦力化農奴化了。在工商各業被侵略者獨佔之後，人民生活，只　下農業，而農　的士地所有權逐漸被侵蝕，或被沒收，並且農民的生產品不能自由販賣，農產必須賤價出售，而一切生活必需品却要用高價買囘來，這種細大不捐的層層剝削，用不了多少年，就使的一般農民，完全喪失田產，而陷入農奴的境遇了。我們最痛心者，東亞民埃，在日本這種政策之下，要遂漸　越貧越愚，而最後趨于滅亡。而這里所說少愚，不茅素樸之愚，而是頑鈍無恥之愚，肉爲日本軍關在敎育上，在行政上，獎勵頑鈍無恥，他們要使得被征服的人民大羣，只知道怕日本，越無恥越好，越做壞事越好，越喪失道德觀念越好，其目的，在使得人民大羣，父子不相謀，朋友不相救，都成了一粒一粒的散沙，只會向强者屆膝乞命。總之一句話：日本軍閥要敎東亞民族，完全喪失了東方文化的道德觀念而成了，足完全的奴隸社會。而日本軍閥僅此還不放心，還要加上毒化政策與嫖賭政策。因爲他們嫉妬這些被征服人民中，還有一部份資財　盡，又害怕這些人因煩悶苦痛，而生異心，所以你們軍隊所佔之地，第一就是獎　或者强迫人民吸噓啡，白面與鴉片，同時勸嫖勸賭。好敎這被征服大羣快一點窮，快一點死，同時藉着毒化與嫖賭之力，麻醉軟化這些人，使他們忘了國家民族，忘了一切，並且無氣力，無精神，以自拔于黑暗之中。你們軍閥這種政策，自一方面說，可　　巧；而自另一方面說，　在是愚昧得可憐。</p>
<p>日軍閥之一　失敗史</p>
<p>請看一看日本自己因　種卑劣政策所得的影響如何？就可以知道將來最受害者，還是日本自己！日本的政策，一言蔽之，是忘本；人到志了本，是必然失敗的。日本與中國及其他東亞民族，在近代西方科學文明觀點上，本來都是一樣落後的國家；而日本維新，占了半世紀之先，你們軍閥就飛揚跋扈，以爲自已是亞洲唯一的優等民族，而視其他爲劣等民族，這眞是器小易盈，毫無大國的丰度。中國革命與日本明治維新，是東亞民族的兩件大事，而日本軍閥，却只誇耀自己，而抹殺中國，把中國看做可以和朝鮮一樣的併吞，不過中國大一點，以爲若用　食手叚，分成幾次，就可以併看下去，所以第一涉，佔東四省，第二步，侵冀察等省，以爲靠日本的武力，準可不戰而成功，卽使中國抵抗，也很容易的可以把中國抵抗力消滅，不錯！日本的軍事專家，計算飛　大砲的數量是很精細的。他們計算中國打不過日本，也確有科學上的理由，只可惜他們甚麽都會計算，只是沒有計算到人心。他們只讀過半世紀的日本維新史，至多讀了些幾百年來的西洋科學書，和戰史，而竟然林殺了你們　代祖先熟讀過的立國五千年的中國歷史，否定了中國民族文化的權威，與近幾十年來中國革命的發展。　他們那一點軍事知識，就以爲武力萬能，天下一切問題，都可以任意解决，而不知道真正友　世界者，是道　的文化的力量，而不是人炮飛機，客觀說來，還真是日本民族不幸！我可以指明一點，你們軍閥對子中國及其他在東亞民族，沒有過半點尊重愛護之心；能併呑便併呑；能侵略必侵略，這多年來，對中國固然有緩　急進之不同，但其有　緩進的原因，還是從武　上計算，是對歌美客氣，並不是對我們　悲。你們試想四十年前，因　國干涉而還我遼東，假使不干涉，你們肯　嗎？實際上，那時候就想佔領北京了，中國在淸未，實在人心散漫，不能自强。而托庇于列強均勢之下，日本因羽毛　，不敢獨異，所以日俄戰後，仍然將南滿交還中國，然　戰一起，就立刻拿出了廿一條，所以日本軍閥對華侵略的緩急，完全看國際形勢。換　話說，就是時刻計算日本的武力，與列强可以在東亞使用的武力的比較：華府會　計算敵不過英美，所以就了範圍；而九一八之變，是因爲自恃海軍進步，幷看穿英美不　聯合，所以下了毒手，總之，你們軍閥征服中國的政策，是一貫的，而其施行政策之綏急，則完全計算自已的武力，與歐美的態度，而從來沒有把這　大的中國民族，本身的權利與人格，置諸計算之内，這眞可謂愚　至極，無以復加了。</p>
<p>中　民族爲東亞眞正和平而戰</p>
<p>我可以明白吿訴你們，這幾年，自從我們冀察等省，又受到幾重威脅以來，中國民族實在對日本寒了心。我們全軍全民，確實認識了日本，認識了自己，我們大家知道，除非全國團結到底奮鬥，就眞要亡國滅種，我們不　使我們本身做侵略者的奴隸，更不　使我們百代祖先的榮譽光輝，　于我們之手，及我們子子孫孫成了貧愚無恥的奴隸之羣。同時，我們有把握的，知道只要團結奮鬥，就準能粉碎日本軍閥的野心，而最後使日本民族囘到光明的正路。東亞民族這一個大害，我們這一代的中國人。誓要挺身負責，加以驅逐，因爲深知只有中國民挨，能負這個責任。我們的立志是救中國；救東亞，並救日本。你們日本民衆想一想，你們立國東亞，而奴視東亞民族，這把自己的立腳點先弄壞，怎　會有好的結果？中國民族旣已下了絕對不屈　不亡國的決心，戰一月有一月的進步，戰一年有一年的進步，老實說，中國經過兩年的抗戰，不但精神的力量更加強，更統一了，實際上軍事上也天天在進步。你們軍閥　要消滅中國軍力，以貫澈　亡華野心，怎樣也做不到，相反的，我們有把握，一定能粉碎日本軍閥的迷夢，而建立東亞民放間的眞正和平。</p>
<p>日政府的實際指揮者</p>
<p>日本民衆們，行惡必得惡報，你們大衆現在的一切痛苦，都是受你們軍閥政策的惡報，而現在才開始受，今後受到什麽程度，眞不堪設想，根本上說，你們軍閥要使東亞諸民族，喪失自由，日本民衆，同樣也喪失了自由。天下事便宜是占不得的，你們侵佔我東北，得了便宜，迅速使得軍紀墜落，而演成軍人專政的蚊局，你們國家今天只是一羣狂妄無識的少壯軍官鈇治者，大政據于軍部，而實則操于一羣少壯軍官之手，而這一羣人，有野心而無識見，又議輪紛紛，各立門戶，所以結果，只有越唱侵略高調者，越得勢力。你們國家的行動，實際上就是這極少數狂妄軍閥指導，而把持竊取大權，無惡不作，國體紀綱全沒有了，内閣更不過是這些軍閥手中的象皮玩具。只有聽他們的搬弄，兩年前的　　橋事件，在戰端開始以後，你們報紙業已　意洋洋的自認是計劃的行動了……戰爭是　等大事，而你們民衆大羣，只是被動的，聽少數軍閥的擺布。而貢献資財和生命，並且時時刻刻需要謳歌軍部之功，且只許謳歌，不許反對，倘稍示懷疑。就要坐監牢，　拷問，這兩年來，被憲兵警察捕入監獄的上千上萬的日本知識份子，與我東四省所謂思想犯者，不是同樣的境　嗎？這種情形，說穿了，　不足怪。但看你們若十元老電臣，對于日本興盛。本有特殊　勞，他們站在　成謀國的立場，只是態度稍近持重，軍閥就覺得碍眼碍手，立刻使人加以殲殺，如屠宰犬豕一般，毫無顧忌。而且主謀發動的人，也毫不受到法律制裁。大人物的境遇尙且如此，你們百姓，當然更是俎上魚肉，實同奴隸</p>
<p>日軍閥企圖向歐美挑戰</p>
<p>原來你們軍閥思想的特色，是絕對不認錯。自己錯了，却仇恨別人，接着更要打算消滅別人，這幾年不承認自己侵略中國的錯誤，而恨中國抵抗；現在進攻兩年達不到目的，因老羞而成怒，叉恨到歐美國家了。當然，你們軍閥其志不止于反英，而目前第一步，先表示反英。因爲他　又計　過了。英國在歐洲多事，所以先對付英國，而將擁有太平洋大艦隊的美國，暫呻擱置，作第二步分別擊破之謀。這種技倆，自謂甚巧，其實早被世界看穿，幷且忘了各關係國有共同利害。共同立場。日本民衆要知道，你們軍閥的國際政策，一言蔽之，是棄約背信，各國對華關係，受着九國公約的拘束，日本侵華，是日本　約背信。英美法諸大國不附和日本，而守九　公約的立場，這是當然之事。蘇聯不在九國公約，而因國聯的關係，其立場完全同英美法一樣。這些國家尊重中國主權，而不附和日本的侵略，這只是國際社會當然之行爲，而日本軍閥竟然仇恨各國，要消滅各國在華條約上的合法利益，這當然是對世界的重大挑釁，其趨勢嚴重，是不問可知的，日本統治者，近來盛倡「東亞新秩序」，你們要明瞭所謂新秩序的内容，就是要把大中華民國征服了，同時把各國排出去。侵中國要戰爭，排各國也當然要武力，你們可以算一算日本究竟共有多少壯了？多少武力？中國有句諺語「盲人騎跑馬　夜半臨深池。」你們日本民衆，自甘從，而任令瞎馬的軍部，把日本國家拖向萬丈深淵而疾馳，「九一八」以來，日本實情完全如此，而　源樣本，凡日本民衆所正受及將受的無窮禍害，都由於日本軍閥奴視東亞民族的一念而起，你們再不覺悮自救。必有後悔不及之一日了！</p>

<h3 id="c57">溫布爾頓女單打決賽形勢已定　由梅白兒與史丹瑪絲爭錦標　五個錦標美選手有包辦之勢 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>（温布爾頓七日電）昨日天氣、乍晴乍雨、風勢亦大、但網球比賽仍繼續舉行、女子單打决賽者經已揭曉、男子雙打中法老將已遭敗北、故男女單雙打及混合雙打各種錦標、据倫教方面推測、將爲美選手一手包辦、茲將各情彙誌于下、</p>
<h3 id="c58">史瑪絲小姐　戰勝范平夫人 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>女子單打、亦已舉行複賽，英國史丹瑪絲女士、昨日於複賽中復以七比五、二比六、六比三擊敗美國之范平夫人、而獲決賽權、</p>
<p>史丹瑪絲之進入温布爾頓决賽、此次猶爲第一次、渠爲近數日來男女單打中猶有比賽資格之唯一英國球員、迭獲勝利、足使失望於奧斯汀之一般英國觀衆稍感安慰、</p>
<p>第一盤中、史丹瑪絲女士　場卽以二對零佔先、惟范平夫人亦頗鎭靜、連續進攻以造成五對五之平局、但卒被史丹瑪絲女士連獲二局、而得第一盤之勝利、</p>
<p>第一盤、范平夫人先以四對〇遙居上風、史丹　絲亦迅速扳囘二局、然終以二比六敗北、</p>
<p>第三盤、史丹瑪絲女士球勢甚佳、於三對三之平局後、連勝三局、而獲得最後勝利、</p>
<p>因天雨關係、球賽中途停止三次，全賽時間凡一個半小時、</p>
<h3 id="c59">梅白兒球藝高　揮酒自如 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>另一女單打複賽，梅白兒女士（美）對史比林夫人（丹）、梅之技術顯較對方高出多多、於二十分鐘的時間內、卽以六比〇、六比〇兩光盤獲勝、史夫人之球藝、迴非其敵、鮮有於任何一局中獲勝至二點以上者、據計算、第一盤中史比林失人僅勝九點，第二盤僅勝五站、比賽情形爲絕對之一面　、亦温布爾頓最後關頭中罕見之奇跡也、</p>
<h3 id="c60">女雙打　進入複賽 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>女子雙打第三週、勃朗女士與査維絲女士（英）以六比三、三比六、八比六淘汰哈德維克與史克　文女士（英）、但于第四週中、勃朗女士一組卒以兩個二比六敗于種子球員妮古爾女士與納曹爾女士（英）之手、故仍未獲進入半複賽、</p>
<p>妮古爾女十與納曹爾女士于淘汰勃朗女士與査維絲女土後將與傑考白女士（美）與約克女士（英）作複賽、另一組之半複賽、結果尙朱見　知、</p>
<h3 id="c61">混合雙打　意外結果 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>最後進入混合雙打半複賽者爲基倫與膠麗米絲透夫人（比）以六比四、一比六、六比三勝法國組之鮑賽斯與亭路汀女士、亦出人意外之結果也。</p>
<h3 id="c62">男雙打夠精彩　美名手獲勝利 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>男子雙打複賽、一組為柯基與列格斯（美）對飽羅脫拉與勃羅能（法）、後二人為雙打老名手、擅於久戰、素有「牛皮糖之稱、但柯基與列格斯同爲本屆男子單打决賽人，技術工夫、高人一籌、合作搭配、尤有珠聯璧合之妙於是法國老將亦不得不以六比四、三比六、六比二、六比三甘拜下風、此賽頗有精彩、實爲昨日比賽中最爲出色之一場、</p>
<h3 id="c63">英選手　入複賽 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>男子雙打半複賽中、海爾與與王爾德（英）勝潘塞克與米蒂克（南）、結果六比四、三比六、六比二、六比三、—該組將與同國之奧立夫與雪耶士組爭奪對美國組之决養權、</p>
<h3 id="c64">五個錦標　美可包辦 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>大賽結果、形勢已愈明瞭、男子單打鋪標、必　於美、女子單打所存二人爲英國史丹瑪絲女士與美之梅白兒女士、據倫敦方面推測、梅之希望實較史丹瑪絲女士爲濃、男子　打、柯基與列格斯、亦可戰勝奧立夫與沙耶士對海　與王爾德一組之勝利者而奪得錦標、</p>
<p>女子雙打，梅白兒與范平夫人無疑爲全球女子雙打中最傑出之一組、榮膺冠軍、勢所必然、至於混合雙打、將來决賽必爲列格斯與梅白兒女士對　基與范平夫人、無論勝利屬於何組、其爲「美國的勝利」亦無疑義。</p>
<p>由此觀之、大會錦標將由美國一手包辦、</p>
<h3 id="c65">申報杯義賽頒獎　改期本月十六夕舉行 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>

<p>— 宋慶齡</p>
<p>孫中山先生的首先兩個主義是謀民族獨　和民權建立的勝利其第三個民生主義是謀改善中國人民的生活狀况，在農業國家的我國，自然土地問題是極爲重要。孫先生相信，耕者應有其田，對於政治統一之後的產業發展階段，他定下的政策是國家統治資源，鐵道與公用事業，和國家節制私人企業，不過這並非抑制，而是鼓勵私人企業在一定的方面之內發展，使之適合國家經濟建設的需要。這種進步雖是仍然不够，但在今日抗戰的過程中，我們看見孫先生的這些經濟理想巳在開始實現了。許多地方已經核滅了田租捐稅，荒地也在墾殖，我們的戰時建設是在國家提倡之下進行的，而且透過一些機　，如同工業合作社，是以民主的路線組織的。抗戰以後，我們　料中國的經濟發展，將是全民族各部分的人民，都能佔得一份的型態。</p>
<p>許多人或因惡意，或因愚昧將中華民族的統一線　空加染些鮮濃的赤色，他們應當淸楚了解，正因爲這個民挨統一戰線是代表着各黨派各國内民族各階級，爲民族解放這個目的的眞正的共同努力，所以從最初卽認爲是這個共同行動的綱領的三民主義，就成爲統一戰綫政策的真實基礎。三民主義是一個民族獨立民主革命的綱領。在這　網領範圍之內，私有財產的原則是不會被攻擊或廢止的。唯一不免的僅是沒收×人及漢奸的財產。</p>
<p>對内是如此，對外國的資本也是如此。中國歡迎外人的貿易與投資祇要伴何國家願意帮忙中國的建設。孫先生在領導國民黨的時期内，曾屢次聲明，凡願在平等，非侵略，對中國希望提高其國際地位同情的基礎上，與中國交往的各國，中國將努力以各種方法促進與這些國家的經濟關係。</p>
<p>可是我們應當毫不隱蔽的吿訴朋友們，目前國内的民族統一戰線工作的發展，還存着嚴重的弱點，主嬰是少數保守派，至今還不深刻瞭解孫先生三大政策的理想，或明或暗的在以各種藉口不願加緊全民族團結，抗戰建國綱領的執行，則不能言行如一，因此隨着抗戰發展應有的政治民主化不僅不能循序發展，在有些地方，在某種程度上。民主範圍相反的縮小。這不僅對動員全民參加抗戰將發生不良的結果，而且難於肅淸叛徒汪精衛投降屈辱思想的滋畏，這是我們內政一個嚴重現象，我相信我們忠於係先生理想的同志們一定會以　大的努力，克服當前這些缺憾，否則，抗戰最後勝利有什麽保障呢？這些不忠實民族統一戰線及限制民主政治發展的現象，不僅對中國抗戰前途不利，且對民主國家在華利益的保障亦沒有前途，因爲對內團結不足，政治改進遲緩，必然逐漸削弱抗戰力量，以至妄冀和平停戰，定向失敗道路，那時候，民主國家在華一切利益權，亦將因我抗戰中途失敗，而遭日本掃　凈盡，所以我希望大家嚴密的注意民主國家中的頑固　份子，他們以憂慮遠東赤化蔓延的口實，主張對華妥協調停或和平談判，這種活動，不僅對我們中國抗戰到底不利，同時亦卽犧牲民主國家在華利益的愚笨行爲，日本帝國主義不是早已命令汪精衛公開主張和平反共嗎？不是同時在進行威迫上海公共相界，封鎖天津以及中國沿海口岸。迫使民主國家犧牲一切在華利權嗎？不是到處公開進行反英運動嗎？所謂國際間的調停不過是助長侵略者野心的發展，同時為民主車家在遠東自燬長城之不智的舉動。</p>
<p>這是不能否認的，目前中國的民族抗戰，在保衛民主世界的利益方面看來，責任是民主國家與反民主國家全世界範圍鬥爭中，重要的戰爭的一部分。這決不是理想主義的口號，民主國家政府最講實際的人們像美國政府尤其是華盛頓的海軍當局該很清楚了解這一點的。在中國戰線上擊返日人，也就是保　美洲的民主制度。就本人所知道的，在最近Iirna會議之　，美國的孤立主義已由本國擴大到了整個的西半球，本人堅持依賴全世界民主勢力的團結，相信在美國的你這這些友人，也會善自實行傑佛　和潘　所光揚演講的民主主義和國際主義的傳統。七七恰巧在七四（美國獨立紀念日）和七一四（法國革命紀念日）之間，同時象徵了這兩個革命，因為目前的中國民族抗戰，受著七七以後諸事件的督促，在　　上　是法國和推翻舊制度的革命和解放美洲殖民地地位的美國革命。除非　到五分之一的人類　中國能夠　受到民族的平等自由，中國潛伏的偉大生產力將不會獲得解放，　全世界的均能　得其得。這是說明中國目前的民族革命是必須的而且是不可避免的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Second Anniversary of the War of Resistance and the Embarrassment of the Japanese <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Our all-out war of resistance against Japan has yesterday marked two full years. We have used heroic sacrifices to shatter the Japanese bandits' delusion of "conquering China in a year and a half, and then settling the post-war situation in a year or half a year." Looking back on these two full years, the rise and fall of the Japanese bandits' operations in China, and their political and diplomatic changes, the process of the Japanese bandits from flourishing to stagnation, and then to decline, are all clearly visible. From the perspective of the general trend, whether military, political, economic, or social, they have all reached a state of embarrassment.</p>
<p>The period of the Japanese bandits' military gains was the coastal warfare period after the occupation of Nanjing. However, since entering the Battle of Xuzhou, the progress has been quite slow. After we abandoned Guangdong-Hankou Railway, they almost completely stagnated, and are increasingly declining. From last year, the month of to the present, more than eight months have passed. The Japanese bandits have failed to occupy more strongholds as scheduled. Even in Changsha, which suffered an unexpected fire, the Japanese bandits were unable to take advantage of the situation to occupy it, with only Nanchang as the city they occupied. Afterwards, although the Japanese army also [illegible characters] on the northern and southern battlefields, they did not achieve much success, only wasting manpower and money in vain.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, the Japanese bandits' situation has also become increasingly chaotic with the decline of the military. Since the "July 7th Incident" led to our all-out war of resistance, the Japanese bandits have focused on strengthening their internal affairs institutions, hence the "Cabinet Council System," "Planning Board," "Ministry of Health and Welfare," "Planning Secret Council," and even the establishment of the "General Headquarters." The Konoe Cabinet also underwent two strengthened reorganizations, especially the major reorganization in May of last year, which supplemented considerable strength in both essence and form. The Japanese government could only be considered to have truly become a wartime cabinet at this time. However, due to the stagnation of the war of aggression against China, which was expected by all parties, Prime Minister Konoe, who possessed the most subjective conditions, finally had to decisively submit his resignation, and was succeeded by the "least popular" Hiranuma Cabinet. After the Hiranuma Cabinet came to power, the situation was completely different from that of the previous Konoe Cabinet. Not only were no specific policies announced, but it was also caught between the veteran senior officials faction and the young military officers faction, making it difficult to please both sides. Its political efficiency can be said to be completely equal to zero. Recently, although they have tried to cope with the internal and external crises with some kind of "molting strategy," the result still cannot avoid the political contradictions inherent in Japanese capitalism [illegible characters]'s dominance.</p>
<p>In diplomacy, its embarrassing situation is even more obvious. The conflict of duality has evolved to the point where it seems similar to the previous example, and the government finally tends to run behind the [illegible characters] of military power... This is the peculiarity of the inverted relationship in the development process of Japanese capitalism... But it can be asserted that it will inevitably encounter internal and external obstacles and re-ignite the contradiction and crisis of the military. The negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo may not go smoothly, and the attempt to please the United States, as claimed by the Japanese side today, may not be effective. It goes without saying that the threat to the Soviet Union will be met with "double retaliation." Although Hitler's warnings to Japan are extremely earnest... due to the result of observing Japan's war power—but Japan's incompetent politicians and warlords are unable to shoulder this heavy responsibility and break their own deadlock. Although the naval aspect is flattered by the award, the harassment of the South China coast is just harassment; the army aspect is quite depressed because of Hitler's criticism that "it will take seventeen or eighteen years to restore vitality," and wants to superficially cheer up with reckless actions against the Soviet Union, but the result is just hitting a wall and making a fool of itself.</p>
<p>We commemorate the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. We must also deeply face the embarrassment of the Japanese bandits in military, political, economic, and social aspects.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Strategic and Tactical Issues in the Sino-Japanese War <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Report by a Senior Member of the Military Commission</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) A senior member of the Central Military Commission recently inspected various war zones. Before Spring, in a certain location, he delivered this report to combat commanders after a certain area [illegible characters]. This is a brief record. The committee member has personally reviewed it. After a partial deletion, it is specially published to the people of our country:</p>
<p>Introduction - War is a continuation of policy, so strategy is subordinate to policy. The policies of the two countries, [illegible character] to the highest stage of development, will lead to war. Therefore, the relationship between policy and strategy is even closer. The success or failure of strategy will inevitably affect policy.</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese Side</p>
<p>[1] The Historical Stages of the Japanese Aggression Policy</p>
<p>Annexing China and monopolizing East Asia is a consistent national policy of Japanese aggression against China - especially the only national policy advocated by Japanese warlords. This has developed from the strategy of Emperor Meiji of Japan to the present.</p>
<p>1.  After the Sino-Japanese War, the first stage was to implement the divide-and-rule policy of using Chinese to control Chinese.</p>
<p>2.  After the September 18th Incident, the second stage was to implement the policy of gradual encroachment without fighting to win.</p>
<p>3.  Starting with the July 7th Incident, the third stage was to implement the policy of swallowing China whole by winning in one battle.</p>
<p>Although the above policies have different stages, the basic policy of state affairs is consistent. Therefore, in coordination with these policies, there are also different stages in various aspects. A. On the Chinese side</p>
<p>In the first stage, economic aggression was the main focus - a movement mainly based on boycotting Japanese goods arose in China.</p>
<p>In the second stage, political aggression was the main focus; in China, a national salvation movement arose, mainly based on political struggle that did not recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo and the puppet regimes of Eastern Hebei and Chahar in order to resist Japan.</p>
<p>The third stage is military aggression - the War of Resistance broke out in China.</p>
<p>B. Internally</p>
<p>In the first stage, capital outflow was encouraged - economic development and the formation of conglomerates resulted, arousing the jealousy of warlords.</p>
<p>In the second stage, secret service agencies became active - military personnel became tyrannical and murdered ministers, arousing resistance from conglomerates?</p>
<p>In the third stage, the navy, army, and air force took joint action - warlord autocracy and conglomerate vassals aroused popular dissatisfaction. C. Foreign policy</p>
<p>In the first stage, there was competition with various countries - resulting in the Nine-Power Treaty restricting Japanese development.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the interests of various countries in China were rejected - causing dissatisfaction among various countries and gradually leading to isolation.</p>
<p>In the third stage, an attempt was made to monopolize East Asia - arousing opposition from various countries. (2) Japanese Military Policy for the Aggression of China</p>
<p>The first stage was the period of developing national strength - the purpose was to be on par with the great powers.</p>
<p>The second stage was the period of strengthening national strength - the purpose was to surpass any country in the East.</p>
<p>The third stage was the period of using national strength - the purpose was to quickly conquer China, use China's national strength to monopolize East Asia, and prepare for the Pacific War, resulting in the consumption of national strength. (3) The Strategic Policy of the Japanese Aggression War</p>
<p>Based on its national policy and general policy, the Japanese [illegible character] strategic policy of aggression is undoubtedly to fight a quick battle to achieve a quick victory. There are three conditions for realizing this strategy:</p>
<p>1.  Reduce Main Force - The main reliance is on frontal firepower to inflict casualties in order to weaken our main force. Nothing more than relying on outflanking our main force in an attempt to annihilate it.</p>
<p>2.  Occupy Territory - Seize large cities and implement economic blockade.</p>
<p>3.  Lose Our Side's Will to Fight - Create puppet regimes to isolate our country, provoke internal strife, and spread an atmosphere of peace.</p>
<p>However, the first phase of operations proved that these policies failed. Why? Because: 1. Basically, the Japanese lacked self-awareness and misjudged us.</p>
<p>2.  Although the Japanese army is strong, it is small and lacks sufficient capital. The Japanese are also reluctant to use it. Although we are weak but large, with a large population, we are the only ones who can sacrifice, preserve, and continue to fight against the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to lose our fighting ability has failed. Our land is large, and the Japanese cannot occupy much. They only occupy points and lines. Moreover, we are an agricultural country, and even if we lose many cities, we can still be self-sufficient, and external routes are still open. It is difficult to blockade the economy, and the Japanese themselves are also eager to trade.</p>
<p>3.  The Japanese are too barbaric, degenerated, and cruel, with everyone seeking profit. Therefore, the puppets and traitors they create are useless. Our unity and solidarity are becoming stronger, and national consciousness is increasing. The atmosphere of peace is difficult to succeed. The international community is not isolated, and foreign aid is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese policy of fighting a quick battle to achieve a quick victory has failed, do they have the determination to fight a long-term war? Even if they talk about it on paper and write about it, it is still not enough, and they will not do so, because:</p>
<p>1.  They do not want to consume too much in China.</p>
<p>2.  They are eager to digest what they have gained in China.</p>
<p>3.  They are anxious to prepare for a world war, attempting to end the war against China during or shortly after the start of this war.</p>
<p>What the Japanese continue to do is the policy of quick peace and quick resolution. This policy is a continuation of the policy of fighting a quick battle to achieve a quick victory, but it has also been severely refuted by our supreme leader and cannot be realized. Therefore, the Japanese have to consider changing their policy.</p>
<p>(4) The New Policy of Japanese Aggression Against China - That is, a comprehensive expansion. This policy is a supplement to and development of the third stage of aggression, the policy of winning China in one battle. The policy of the third stage has already been overturned and has become a policy of protracted war. The Japanese still do not dare to comprehensively invade and have been trying it out here for the past four or five months.</p>
<p>1.  In the military aspect, sweeping is more important than offense.</p>
<p>2.  In the economic aspect, development is more important than blockade.</p>
<p>3.  In the political aspect, both utilization and provocation are used.</p>
<p>4.  In the spiritual aspect, appeasement is more important than brutality.</p>
<p>In short, focusing on managing the occupied [illegible character] area, thinking of using China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to fight China.</p>
<p>(5) The International Policy of the Japanese - Differentiation is more important than confrontation.</p>
<p>1.  Using both hard and soft tactics against Britain.</p>
<p>2.  Courting [illegible character] America.</p>
<p>3.  Easing relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>4.  Threatening France.</p>
<p>5.  Utilizing and coordinating with Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>In a word, they want to isolate us with the international situation, and everything in the East must go through them.</p>
<p>6.  The New Offensives of the Japanese - This demonstrates the variability, opportunism, and contradictions of their policies.</p>
<p>The Japanese do not implement the above policies in an unchangeable way because: 1. Their goal is still to win China in one battle.</p>
<p>7.  The core is comprehensive aggression.</p>
<p>8.  The international situation is changing rapidly, stimulating their opportunism and coordinated action.</p>
<p>9.  There are three kinds of opinions within the country.</p>
<p>10. Stop attacking and manage the occupied [illegible character] area:</p>
<p>11. Continue to attack directly to the southwest and northwest.</p>
<p>12. Emphasize the management of the occupied [illegible character] area while not abandoning the mutually argumentative offensive. As a result, a conciliatory policy was adopted, hence the trial campaign in Nanchang. This includes the meanings of military occupation, political attack, economic tightening, and traffic disruption. It is estimated that in the future, the Japanese will attack in the following areas:</p>
<p>13. Four directions in the Yangtze River Basin,</p>
<p>14. The northwest, 3. The southwest,</p>
<p>Estimate the basis of the dynamics of Japanese political affairs:</p>
<p>1.  Under favorable conditions - I have weaknesses exposed, and [Japanese]'s donation is not large,</p>
<p>2.  Under necessary conditions - [Japanese] believe that it is necessary to comprehensively invade:</p>
<p>3.  Austria, Germany, and Italy coordinate and support actions,</p>
<p>4.  The most important thing is the change and increase in the [Japanese]'s troops.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese take a step and stop, which exposes the basic weakness of the [Japanese] – insufficient troops, which forms the opportunism and contradictions of its policies because its policies are still being tested, but its basic policies - swallowing China and monopolizing East Asia, and the policy of winning China in one battle in the stage of aggression, are still a consistent vein and have not changed, but have been deepened. However, this is the expansion of comprehensive aggression, with politics above military. Therefore, is there a possibility of a new stage transformation of aggression in this, please talk about the future problem</p>
<p>(7) The Future of Japanese Aggression Policy,</p>
<p>To talk about the future, we must first talk about the Japanese's attempt and the possibility of its realization. The Japanese's attempt:</p>
<p>1.  A quick battle and a quick decision on the military - failed,</p>
<p>2.  A quick peace and a quick decision on the expansion - we refused, and were not fooled;</p>
<p>3.  So, a comprehensive invasion was launched - to try to win the upper hand, to strive for advantages, to oppress us, and to defeat us (this includes fierce offensives before and after the outbreak of the war) - this general policy is still to win China in one battle, that is, this stage is still military-oriented, although it has entered a stage where politics is more important than military affairs, but it is still attempting to end the war and the battle situation. However, if we do not let him, and strive for a period that is favorable to us, that is, the stalemate stage, to prepare for the counter-offensive, then the Japanese's attempt will not be realized. Today is the beginning of this struggle. Generally speaking, the Japanese attempt is not possible to be fully realized at present, the condition is that the war cannot be finished and cannot be reconciled, so the battle situation will not end. However, because this is a complicated situation, a complicated war, it is possible to have two aspects, both possibilities have not been fully achieved and entered the second possibility, that is, a situation of no war and no peace, so the conditions for realizing this situation may exist,</p>
<p>4.  The front line has choked our important traffic routes, and there is a considerable area in the [Japanese] area that can be ruled?</p>
<p>5.  The puppet government merges, and even changes its form and uses the name of the National Government to confront us, and the puppet army has a considerable development,</p>
<p>6.  Economically control all of us, and foreign trade, and all countries must go through his hands, and attract a part of our economic traitors to merge with him,</p>
<p>7.  Internationally, use the opportunity that countries have no time to ask about the East Asian war,</p>
<p>8.  Spiritually, restore ancient times and insult the Chinese culture, and even use the Three People's Principles to deceive.</p>
<p>If this situation is realized, it will become the fourth stage of Japan's aggression against China, and its policy will be to stop offensive without war and no peace on the front, and focus on operating the [Japanese] region in an attempt to force us to be safe, trap us in the interior, and wait for the outbreak of the world war, which can fight against me again, so this is not a completely favorable stalemate situation for me, but a situation created by [Japanese], when the possibility of realizing this situation is not very great, but the main thing is still determined by the war between the [Japanese] and me, so currently, in terms of the Japanese, the Japanese are launching a comprehensive invasion but still cannot achieve the expected goal, he will turn to the stage of the no-war-no-peace aggression policy, and we not only cannot allow the arrival of the no-war-no-peace situation, but also do not allow any success in the development of the comprehensive invasion, and strive for the arrival of a stalemate situation that is favorable to me in preparation for the counter-offensive, and bury the third stage of the Japanese invasion of China.</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, it is in a transitional stage and the new policy of the [Japanese] contains two futures, or it will be defeated by us, or it will turn into a new situation.</p>
<p>In short, on the overall route of the Japanese policy strategy, the basic policy of the Japanese annexing China and monopolizing East Asia is adventurous, just like Germany and Italy, and because their country is small, with few people, few products, not a long history, too many enemies, and few helpers, etc., it may be an even more adventurous national policy, but the Japanese take advantage of the opportunity, take advantage of my weaknesses, take advantage of the international situation. Taking advantage of his military advantage, he often changes his policy and strategy, so he will not fail all at once, but he is also unwilling to fail, and is even more striving for a change that is beneficial to him</p>
<p>But no matter what, his policy and strategy are subject to variability, that is, uncertainty, contradiction, and speculation, which is a factor that leads to the failure of his adventurous national policy. As long as we adhere to the national policy of resisting Japan to the end, we will be able to make any attempt by the [Japanese] fail.</p>
<p>(1) Our Side</p>
<p>(1) Three Stages of the Chinese National Liberation Movement.</p>
<p>I. Before the September 18th Incident, the national movement was tied to the civil rights movement - overthrowing the Qing Dynasty [illegible character] and warlords to overthrow the imperialists, and was carried out in many ways to the outside world:</p>
<p>II. After the September 18th Incident - the anti-Japanese political movement - the unification and resistance movement moved towards convergence - to the outside world it was focused, but tortuous and complicated, resulting in peaceful unification and unity to resist aggression;</p>
<p>III. The July 7th Incident - the limit of this national policy of unifying resistance to the end;</p>
<p>9.  The Japanese war of aggression has failed,</p>
<p>10. The revival of the Chinese nation,</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of resisting the war and building the country and establishing a new China of the Three People's Principles, the specific content of this slogan is as instructed by Chairman Chiang:</p>
<p>We must affirm that the Republic of China of the Three People's Principles, which will be established after the victory of the War of Resistance, must be a new country that has surpassed the world, is a truly progressive country that is truly owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, and is used to contribute to the world's human well-being, 28, 4, 17 broadcast</p>
<p>(2) Our Policy and Strategy for the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Under the national policy of resisting the war to the end, our policies are</p>
<p>1.  Protracted war of resistance time</p>
<p>2.  Comprehensive war of resistance - a war of the whole people, space, and people;</p>
<p>3.  Strive for initiative - regenerate through eyesight, active diplomacy; the strategic policy under this policy,</p>
<p>4.  Protracted war - defeat the Japanese quick war and quick resolution!</p>
<p>5.  War of attrition - defeat the Japanese in their quest for advantage and the upper hand.</p>
<p>However, the protracted war is not to drag on, but to fight on, and the war of attrition is not to fight each other randomly, but to eliminate the [Japanese]. (3) The Policy and Strategic Focus of Our Three-Stage War of Resistance,</p>
<p>I. Launch a comprehensive war - mobilize, fully follow the people, mobilize the rear and the front, mobilize the entire line, use all strength, unify will and unify strength.</p>
<p>II. Focus on [illegible character] - politics is more important than military affairs, spirit is more important than matter, guerrilla [illegible character] is more important than regular [illegible character], propaganda is more important than combat, the people are more important than soldiers, and thrift is more important than production.</p>
<p>This is a struggle, a long-term struggle, and a difficult struggle, aimed at the new policy of the Japanese "[Now is the time of a thousand pieces of gold for a moment before the War of Resistance, we are not allowed to re-make empty talks and fantasies, and we are not allowed to spend a minute of time and energy" (Chairman Chiang Si, 17, Broadcast) "Why does the Chairman say this, because,"... The closer we get to victory, the more difficult, more difficult, and more dangerous our environment will inevitably be - (Ibid.) Therefore, we must carry out fierce resistance against the [Japanese] with concrete struggles, and not allow his attempt to be realized.</p>
<p>(4) Launch Struggles in All Aspects - Launch a Comprehensive War and Focus on [illegible character]:</p>
<p>I. Mobilization in the spiritual aspect - this is basic, Chairman said, "If we want to repel the [Japanese] in this war of resistance and succeed in building the country, the other half is to develop the spiritual power of every member of our nation" (Ibid.) How to carry out spiritual mobilization? Chairman said, "We should aim at the current strong [Japanese], face the national difficulties squarely, reflect on our responsibilities most importantly, and earnestly review all our shortcomings [illegible character] weaknesses. On the one hand, we will quickly and practically transform ourselves, set an example, and at the same time, lift up our compatriots across the country and help our compatriots who have not yet woken up to rise up together to correct the life of being drunk and dreaming, self-defeating, develop an enterprising and progressive spirit, eliminate the habit of perfunctory survival and obeying in public and disobeying in private, break the attempt of selfishness, surrender, and submission, correct the deviations from error, mislead the country, and mislead the ideological thoughts, tense our emotions, unify our actions, so that our Chinese spleen can be enriched and concentrated, and truly achieve a total spiritual mobilization of unity and play this "supreme and strongest spiritual power to complete our single inheritance and inheritance"</p>
<p>According to the specific work of needle spirit total mobilization should be:</p>
<p>I. Oppose the attempt of compromise and surrender,</p>
<p>II. Oppose the habit and life of perfunctory peace,</p>
<p>III. Oppose erroneous thinking that violates the interests of the War of Resistance and national construction,</p>
<p>IV. Oppose empty talk that only talks but does not do and empty fantasies that deviate from the reality of the War of Resistance,</p>
<p>V. Implement total spiritual mobilization and the oath of national publicity.</p>
<p>VI. Promote national culture and excellent traditions.</p>
<p>VII. Arouse the comprehensive and most wide-ranging awareness of the masses and the masses with lower levels of knowledge who have not yet awakened,</p>
<p>VIII. Strengthen unity - aim at the strong [Japanese], face the national crisis squarely, reflect on the responsibilities, and review the mistakes,</p>
<p>II. Military party:</p>
<p>I. Frontal combat - mainly military warfare, and advancing the frontal decisive battle, giving the [Japanese] step-by-step casualties and [Japanese] counter-war and counter-attack,</p>
<p>II. Rear preparation - to create a positional warfare capability to establish a national defense force to make it mechanized and modernized,</p>
<p>Invasion after [illegible character] - mainly guerrilla warfare,</p>
<p>A. Establish a guerrilla base in the strategic outer money,</p>
<p>B. The structure of the unit is based on political work to create everyone as a combatant and also a political worker,</p>

<h3 id="e3">Chairman Chiang's Radio Address Encourages Comrades in the War Zone to Help Themselves and Save Themselves, Intensify the Battle Behind the Enemy Lines, and Continue Their Efforts <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 7th] Chairman Chiang gave a radio address to the people in the war zone on the occasion of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots in the war zone, today is the second anniversary of our War of Resistance and National Construction, and also the first day of the third year of the War of Resistance. How should we inherit the glorious struggle of the past two years, exert all the strength of the War of Resistance, and achieve our goal of recovering lost territories, expelling the Japanese bandits, and building a new China of the Three People's Principles? This is the common task of the people across the country, especially our comrades in the war zone, who bear a major appointment. Our comrades in the war [illegible character] are suffering from such heavy persecution, oppression, deception, and humiliation by the Japanese bandits, and are living such a painful life of darkness and despair. I miss and grieve for you all the time. I am always concerned about all the comrades, and I always take the task of relieving your pain as my own. However, all comrades must also help themselves and save themselves, and must be more heroic and active in uniting together and fighting alongside the military and civilians across the country.</p>
<p>Compatriots in the war zone, the past facts of your perseverance, courage, and resistance against the Japanese are all reported to me in detail here, which really makes me infinitely excited. Your loyalty and bravery are really the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance. Although the Japanese bandits are all kinds of fierce, you always swear to die without regret, maintain the greatest personality of our Chinese nation, and promote the highest morality of our Chinese nation. Thanks to your proportionate struggle, the effectiveness of our army's comprehensive war is strengthening day by day, and the base of the guerrilla area is expanding and consolidating day by day. Our strategy of "transforming the enemy's rear into the front line" can be fully developed. In the past year, all our actions and deployments in the enemy's rear have achieved close coordination with the comprehensive War of Resistance. Today, our vast war zone has in fact become a situation of heavy encirclement and attack from all sides against the enemy, making the Japanese unable to attend to one thing and lose sight of another, not only making no progress, but also suffering the greatest casualties. These are all the results of the arduous struggle of our comrades in the war zone. If we can redouble our efforts and continue to do so more bravely in the future, we will be able to give the enemy a fatal blow, making the large and small areas occupied by the enemy become large and small bombs, exploding one after another in the enemy's belly, and finally bringing the Japanese to their death.</p>
<p>The result of the two years of the War of Resistance is indeed that "the more the Japanese fight, the weaker they become, and the more our country fights, the stronger it becomes." The Japanese, whether in military, political, financial, economic, transportation, or transportation, none of them do not show a state of distress and exhaustion. It is precisely because of this that they themselves feel that they are at the end of their rope and cannot help but make a final [illegible characters]. The current plan is to use political offensives and spiritual aggression, and the second is to carry out their so-called construction and development in military and economic terms, vainly trying to complete their so-called "using war to support war" poison plan. These two major poison plans are also the last tools for the Japanese to struggle before death. As long as we break these two major poison plans, it will be the death date of [Japanese][illegible characters], and it will be our final victory.</p>
<p>First, let me talk about the conspiracy of the Japanese political offensive. I have explained it in detail in my rebuttal to the Konoe East Asia New Order statement at the end of last year, but there are still shameless traitors who are insane and respond to [Japanese] [illegible characters], selling out the country and seeking surrender. These traitors have already been spurned and sanctioned by the entire nation. However, his conspiracies have not stopped, and the Japanese so-called appeasement policy and deceptive propaganda are also being intensified to our war zone at this time. We must especially reveal the situation of traitors and Japanese colluding. To be honest, since the Japanese published the New Order of East Asia, he has very clearly stated that there is no more true harmony with our country. We also know very clearly that the Japanese are poisonous. He will never realize the dream of the "New Order of East Asia" unless he destroys our entire country and nation and enslaves our generations. The Japanese are now thinking wildly and want to destroy our country at all times. He is afraid that it is too late. How can he have the mind to talk about peace with our China? (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Comfort Families of Fallen Soldiers in the War of Resistance <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram on the 7th to comfort the families of fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance. The full text is as follows: To the Commanders-in-Chief of all war zones, the Commanders-in-Chief of all war zones, the Provincial and Municipal Governments of all provinces and cities, the Party Headquarters of all provinces and cities, and to be forwarded to the families of fallen soldiers throughout the country: Today marks the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. With the utmost sincerity and respect, Zhongzheng extends his deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen soldiers who have died in battle throughout the country. Over the past two years, thanks to the great benevolence and courage of our fallen soldiers who sacrificed their lives for righteousness, the enemy's illusion of a "quick victory" has been completely shattered. The spirit of the Chinese nation, which cannot be humiliated or destroyed, has been illuminated to the world and filled the heavens and the earth by the sacrifices of our fallen soldiers. The foundation for final victory has been laid by the lives of our fallen soldiers. Our fallen soldiers shed their blood on the battlefield and sacrificed themselves to preserve the five thousand years of heritage left by our ancestors and to protect the survival of our four hundred and fifty million compatriots. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy of "I die so that future generations may live" is truly worthy of our fallen soldiers. Although the bodies of the fallen soldiers are gone, their heroic and magnificent spirit has become the sacred national soul, deeply rooted in the hearts of our people for generations to come, and will forever receive the reward of fragrant reputation and respect, never to be erased or disappear. Furthermore, the great achievements of our fallen soldiers are due to the daily teachings of their parents, who encouraged them to be loyal and filial, or the wholehearted support of their wives, who urged them to uphold righteousness. With innate qualities and established foundations, they were able to become more courageous in the face of adversity and treat death as a return home. Therefore, the loyalty and heroism of our soldiers not only adds glory to the national history, but also honors their ancestors and elevates their families. This is why Zhongzheng and the people of the entire nation express their infinite respect to all families.</p>
<p>I still remember that during the first anniversary of the War of Resistance, Zhongzheng paid special tribute to the families of fallen soldiers, saying that Zhongzheng and the people of the entire nation must inherit and strive to complete the unfinished cause of those soldiers. He also said that the parents, wives, and children of those soldiers are also the common relatives of Zhongzheng and the people of the entire nation, and all should fulfill their responsibilities to care for and support them. Now that the War of Resistance has passed another year, the number of families of fallen soldiers has increased even more than last year. Zhongzheng is increasingly aware of the depth of his own responsibilities. Regarding the promotion of the former's achievements, thanks to the perseverance and efforts of the people and soldiers of our country, the light of final victory is getting closer and closer. We pledge to work together to achieve this goal and comfort the glorious spirits of all the fallen soldiers. Regarding the care of the latter's relatives, Zhongzheng is even more mindful at all times, and he has instructed the relevant relief agencies to handle the matter with diligence and care, striving for comprehensiveness, in order to alleviate the pain of displacement and suffering of the families.</p>
<p>However, this War of Resistance covers a vast area, and the origins of the fallen soldiers span all provinces of the country. It is inevitable that there will be omissions in comprehensive investigations. In addition, some families may be trapped in occupied areas, and rescue and relief are difficult due to geographical barriers. Thinking of this, I feel the suffering of some orphans and widows, the pain of hunger and cold, surges in my heart, adding to my infinite sorrow. Therefore, in addition to the existing relief regulations and procedures, Zhongzheng has specifically established several measures to supplement them:</p>
<p>(1) Commanders of all units must report the facts, origins, and family circumstances of their fallen officers and soldiers to the authorities at any time and promptly apply for relief. They must not suppress the information. If the records on file do not provide sufficient information about their families, they should immediately send a document to the government of their original place of residence to investigate and report in detail. They must not arbitrarily delay the process due to omissions, in order to avoid omissions.</p>
<p>(2) Local governments at all levels, when approving and issuing relief funds to the families of fallen soldiers in their respective areas, must issue the funds at any time and place, regardless of financial difficulties. They must not delay or postpone for any reason. Otherwise, once discovered or reported by the families, they will be severely punished without leniency. The families are also allowed to report this fact to the Relief Committee of this Association at any time to apply for prompt issuance.</p>
<p>(3) If any family knows that their children have died in battle but has not yet received the relief certificate, they can directly report to the Relief Committee of this Association, which will forward the information to the original unit commanders to investigate and apply for relief.</p>
<p>(4) If any family does not understand the written language or the procedures for applying for relief and receiving funds, the local Baojia chiefs, gentry, or educators, if they know about it, should automatically assist them in handling the matter, or, in accordance with the preferential treatment measures for the families of soldiers serving in the war, enthusiastic and capable people in various localities should find ways to maintain their livelihoods. This should be regarded as a supplementary item to the secret telegram sent by this Chairman to the gentry and educators of the country on January 19th, and should be implemented earnestly. If local governments and Baojia personnel deliberately withhold the relief funds due to the families, once verified, regardless of the amount, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(5) If any family is in an occupied area and temporarily cannot be rescued and relieved due to administrative limitations, the local Baojia chiefs and fellow villagers should remember that the martyrs died to protect the country and defend the people, and should especially care for the loyal descendants, or jointly collect materials and resources to provide for their livelihood, or take turns to help them with farming, so that they can avoid freezing and starvation. After driving out the tyranny and recovering the lost territories in the future, in addition to the government investigating and providing relief to the original families in accordance with regulations, the families are also allowed to report the assistance provided by the Baojia chiefs and neighbors, and the government will reward them separately to commend their righteousness.</p>
<p>(6) Whenever personnel from central Party, government, and military agencies are sent to the front and rear for inspections and reviews, they should immediately visit and inquire about the families of fallen soldiers in each area to determine whether they have received the relief funds in accordance with regulations and whether the local government and people can effectively comply with the preferential treatment laws and regulations. The actual situation should be reported in detail to the Committee and the central agencies that originally sent them for verification. This should also be included as one of the criteria for evaluating the diligence, merits, and demerits of the dispatched personnel.</p>
<p>The above six points, although concise, are effective measures for implementing the relief regulations and are also the unavoidable responsibilities of Zhongzheng, all levels of military and government officials, and the people of the entire nation. I sincerely hope that you will comply and assist earnestly to make up for Zhongzheng's shortcomings in failing the families of our martyrs, so that all relatives of fallen soldiers can have a dignified old age, that children can grow up properly, that the orphans and widows can be cared for, and that education will not be lacking, comforting the spirits in heaven and further inspiring the morale of the living. I believe that the beloved families of our fallen soldiers will also be able to encourage each other in hardship, work harder, inspire future generations, and continue to serve the country to pass on their glorious legacy for eternity. I express my sincerity and hope for your consideration. Signed by Chiang Zhongzheng, Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, Secret, Chongqing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] The British government's Foreign Trade Guarantee Bill was passed on its first reading in the House of Commons yesterday. According to the provisions of the bill, the Ministry of Commerce's foreign trade guarantee funds will increase from £10 million to £16 million to assist countries in the anti-aggression front in purchasing arms and other military supplies to strengthen their national defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th] According to political sources, the British government intends to allocate a special fund of £100 million for loans to countries in the anti-aggression front. Yesterday, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Greece all requested assistance from Britain. The British Cabinet has approved the request.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Minister Weng Discusses Japanese Economic Ambitions, Attempting to Swallow Chinese Resources in One Bite, We Have Formulated Countermeasures <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Chinese Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, in commemoration of July 7th, issued a declaration exposing Japan's economic policies and ambitions to establish a "New Order" in China, stating that Japan's ultimate goal is to establish a so-called "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Bloc" to deal with any third country. However, the Chinese National Government has decided to break the Japanese attempt. The Japanese have now established the North China Colonization Company and the Central China Development Company. The former has a capital of 350 million Japanese yen, half of which is invested by the Japanese government, and the other half by Japanese merchants. The plan is to control: (1) transportation, (2) telephone and telegraph, (3) mining, (4) salt production, and (5) other industries that can develop the economy of North China. According to company officials, the company only assists and leads Chinese and Japanese entrepreneurs, and does not implement anything itself. The work of the Central China Company is also the same, with a capital of 100 million Japanese yen. The North China Colonization Company has now established the following companies:</p>
<p>(1) North China Petroleum Company, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, half of which is borne by the North China Colonization Company, and the other half by the South Manchuria Railway Mining Company, with the remainder supplemented by the North China Provisional Government.</p>
<p>(2) Manchuria Telephone and Telegraph Company.</p>
<p>(3) Xingzhong Mining Company.</p>
<p>The Japanese pay special attention to the company in Yu-zhong. Currently, the company is able to control the major mining areas. The Central China Development Company, although not well-capitalized, has the right to issue public bonds of 500 million Japanese yen. The company currently has the following five major organizations: (1) Central China Iron Ore Company, (2) Central China Power Company, (3) Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, (4) Central China Telephone and Telegraph Company, (5) Shanghai Real Estate Company.</p>
<p>From these points, it can be seen that the Japanese goal is to control the entire economy of China.</p>
<p>Minister Weng also pointed out Japan's lack of ore, saying that when the Hanyang Iron Works was established in 1890, Japan issued a large number of public bonds, hoping to control China's iron ore mines. Now, the Central China Iron Ore Company is constantly transporting iron to Japan. According to Japanese plans, the annual transport volume will be 5 million tons, and within the year, all the iron ore along the Changting coast will be completely removed. Regarding the textile industry, Minister Weng said that this is another part of Japan's economic aggression plan. Currently, the Japanese will control Chinese and Japanese yarn factories and weaving factories in the occupied areas, produce large quantities of cotton products, transport them to foreign countries, and dump them at low prices in an effort to seize the foreign merchant market.</p>

<p>Martial Law in Shanghai Concessions, Wang's Puppet Government Delayed</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 7th] Today marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The Shanghai Concession authorities have taken strict measures to prevent accidents. From dawn, British troops, U.S. Navy landing forces, Russian merchant groups, commercial volunteer corps, and Shanghai volunteer armored vehicle teams were dispatched to assist the regular and special police in patrolling the streets. It is reported that the Japanese side hoped that Wang Jingwei could form a new puppet government on this day with surprising methods, but it is heard that Wang has requested a slight delay because he does not want to take this risk rashly before obtaining support from figures other than exiled politicians. Observers report that Han Jingwei intends to form another party called the "Anti-Communist Kuomintang," and will later organize an "Anti-Communist Kuomintang Government."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Luo Bosheng, Director of the Political Affairs Group of the Shanghai Public Concession, recently led translators to various Chinese newspapers to inform the publishers that from today until the 8th, any news articles about the "July 7th" anniversary and the words "July 7th" are not allowed to be published. Violators will be severely punished. Some Chinese newspapers plan to suspend publication on the 8th.</p>
<p>Guangdong in a State of Panic, Patrols Present a Tragic Scene</p>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] Rumors are rife here that a large number of Chinese plainclothes soldiers have infiltrated the city, preparing to launch an uprising on the "July 7th" anniversary. Therefore, the Japanese side officially announced martial law at 10:00 a.m. Japanese troops constantly patrolled Sha-area. Those who were preparing to hold a "July 7th Anniversary Parade" found it difficult to move.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] The patrols here were held under strict security, and no incidents occurred. At 11:30 a.m., Sha-area began to return to normal. There were less than five or ten people who passed through Sha-area in the parade.</p>
<h3 id="e8">North China Raw Material Market Monopolized by Japan, Expanding Export Exchange Settlement Through Puppet Organizations, Rejecting European and American Trade <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 7th] The North China Provisional Government announced yesterday that the "Regulations for the Management of Foreign Exchange," which were previously proposed on March 1st, were originally limited to thirteen specific commodities, but henceforth, except for the following seven unimportant commodities, the restrictions apply to all exported goods. This measure will be implemented from July 17th. The seven unrestricted commodities are personal belongings, ship supplies, perishable goods, books, pictures, newspapers, and packaging supplies. The general public believes that this move is a major blow to North China's foreign trade. From July 17th, export merchants must provide foreign exchange transfer certificates when exporting goods, except for the above-mentioned seven types. The proceeds from the goods will be calculated at 14 pence per yuan. As for goods transported to Japan and "Manchukuo," they will be exchanged at par. At the same time, a list of import goods with priority rights will be announced. Export merchants can use this to contact import merchants for foreign exchange. Most of the goods on the priority import list are goods that can be supplied by Japan and goods for "developing" the economy and industry of North China.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Last night, Japanese planes made a second night raid on Chongqing. The public hurriedly took their belongings and went to the suburbs and air-raid shelters to take cover. The emergency alarm was issued at 12:30 a.m., but the number of Japanese planes could not be ascertained. At 1:45 a.m., Japanese planes dropped bombs and incendiary bombs over the city, and the losses of people and property have not yet been tallied. The alarm was not lifted until 2:40 a.m.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Our Large Army Gathers in Southern Shanxi, Fierce Battles in the Shahe River, Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties, Chenghai Abandoned, Chaoan Briefly Entered <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] Although it is certain that the Japanese army has withdrawn a part of its troops and warships from Guangzhou, foreigners believe that this withdrawal cannot be said to be a sign that the Japanese army intends to withdraw from Guangzhou. However, it is true that a large number of Chinese troops have gathered in Guangzhou. Although Japanese sources say that the Chinese troops concentrated in Zengcheng, Sihui, Pijiang, Conghua, and Dongguan are all under the command of Li Han-hun, and 100,000 troops under the command of Bai Pu are prepared to defend the area of Jianxi and Guidong, planning a counter-offensive, Zhang Fakui, the leader of the Tie-leader, has distributed a large army in the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. In addition, Wu Qihui has concentrated two other large armies in the Dongjiang area. Regarding the widely spread news that Chinese guerrillas are active, it is a fact that there are many armed Chinese in Guangzhou, and the Japanese are unable to resist them. They are called "bandits" or "rioters," but when the opportunity arises, these Chinese will all become guerrillas. According to the opinions expressed by foreigners after traveling in various parts of Guangdong, the most important fact in Guangdong is that the Japanese-occupied areas have become a world of bandits, while the areas under the jurisdiction of the Chinese army are peaceful. In addition, there is another fact that is enough to cause rumors of the Japanese army withdrawing from Guangzhou, that is, the small shops opened by the Japanese in Guangzhou have closed down one after another. The Japanese spokesman explained that this was entirely due to the government's policy of treating all businesses equally. As a result, small shops generally feel that it is difficult to maintain themselves under such circumstances, and therefore they have closed down one after another.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] According to unconfirmed news obtained here, fierce battles have occurred several times in the Conghua area in recent days. It is also said that on the evening of the 5th of this month, Chinese plainclothes soldiers engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the Shahe area near Guangzhou. Although the Japanese spokesman denied that there was a fierce battle, he admitted that Chinese guerrillas were indeed very active. According to a reliable eyewitness, he told the Reuters reporter that he witnessed at least a dozen transport vehicles fully loaded with Japanese soldiers killed in battle coming from the west, preparing for cremation.</p>
<p>[Civilian Revolution News Agency, Wengyuan, 7th] After the arrival of more and more Chinese troops in Chaoshan, we have launched a counter-offensive against the Japanese. On the 2nd, we used a part of our forces to attack the Chaoan military station, and another part of our forces charged into the city from the four gates of Chaoan, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. The fighting lasted until 3:00 a.m. on the 3rd, killing many Japanese. Many warehouses and military supplies were burned by our army. Our army withdrew to its original defense after the goal was achieved. It is also reported that 4500 Japanese troops in Chaoshan launched a four-pronged attack on Chenghai from Guanshan, Tuhao, Fa-hao, and Fa-lu on the morning of the 29th of last month. Our team bravely fought back, and fierce fighting continued until noon. The Japanese reinforcements arrived, and our troops were outnumbered and the terrain was unfavorable. After obtaining a certain price, they retreated to a certain place.</p>
<p>[Civilian Revolution News Agency, Zhaoqing, 7th] After Hecheng was recovered by our army, the Japanese in Jiangmen became increasingly panicked, and most of them retreated to North Street. According to news, on the afternoon of the 3rd, more than 500 Japanese troops in Jiangmen retreated to the North Street area. Currently, there are only more than 200 Japanese troops in Jiangmen, with five tanks, stationed at the Xinhe-Jiang-Fo two highway stations.</p>

<p>— (Continued from yesterday's edition)</p>
<p>× Rapid Peace and Rapid Conclusion Failed; Buying Out Traitors and Deceiving the Public</p>
<p>In the past two years of the war, everything, including military affairs and diplomacy, has been under our initiative. The × people have almost stepped into the trap and failure we anticipated. The more the × people struggled, the more mistakes they made; the more we persevered, the more determined we became. One of the most important things was the statement made by the × Prime Minister on December 22nd last year. Since the Sino-Japanese war began a year ago, the × side has been seeking a quick end to the war every day. However, the method it used was not to thoroughly realize its past mistakes and fundamentally abandon its aggression. The reason why it wanted a rapid peace and a rapid conclusion was because it could not achieve a quick victory. Furthermore, it wanted to use the most insidious and despicable means, even more vicious and cruel than the methods used against Korea, to fundamentally swallow us up completely. I thoroughly refuted his cunning schemes at the time. Our military and civilians must have thoroughly understood that the failure of his attempts and the exposure of his conspiracy were the greatest blow to × country and a major turning point for × recently in its desperate situation. However, he still has not given up on this delusion. The slogan of the "New Order in East Asia" that he has already proclaimed cannot be withdrawn. The so-called "East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere" and the Asian League, etc., are things that he knows will fail but is unwilling to abandon. The × people's ambitions have not died, and the aftershocks have not subsided. This movement will inevitably continue to unfold. We are determined to resist the war, which is not worth mentioning. What is most heartbreaking is that there are shameless people who respond to this statement of destroying China and openly engage in acts of betraying the party, the country, and selling out the nation. Although they have been severely condemned by the public and sanctioned by the law, it must still be said that this is the greatest stain on our war of resistance, and it is the greatest regret that so many martyrs cannot rest in peace underground. To be honest, these traitors' so-called peace movement is actually a movement to destroy the country. If the × people and traitors succeed in their poisonous schemes, then the day the "New Order in East Asia" is established will be the day our Chinese nation is reduced and enslaved. The day the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere succeeds will be the day China is effectively merged into Japan. After the × country announced the "New Order in East Asia", it is very clear that it has no intention of making peace with us except to completely destroy China and turn us into its slaves. Today, we have only victory over the × people, only the complete achievement of our war aims; apart from this, there is absolutely no other path to take. Otherwise, surrendering to × is "the peace of the traitors". In other words, it is the peace of slaves, the peace of destruction. Unless one intends to sell out the entire China like a traitor, no one will recognize this fact again. Originally, at the end of last year, when the second phase of our war of resistance began, the internal and external situations obviously improved, and the goal of victory was in sight. However, these traitors wanted to undermine the war of resistance at this critical juncture, trying to deceive the public with shameless words, shaking the belief of our compatriots in the war of resistance, harming our soldiers who were fighting bloody battles, and obliterating the achievements of our national military and civilians who sacrificed their lives. We have searched through history and cannot find a precedent for such madness, lack of integrity, and cruelty.</p>
<p>In fact, the × people's declaration of this "New Order in East Asia" is not only a poisonous hand against China, but also tantamount to declaring war on the world. How could the × people ever have thought of a thread of peace? These traitors do not think that the × people have already dug their own graves; these traitors disregard the country and willingly die for the × people. Isn't it madness to the extreme to want to drag the more glorious nation to be buried with them? Our national military and civilians, after such training, can be firm and united, recognize the stakes, and distinguish right from wrong without any hesitation. This is indeed the greatest success of our China this year. From now on, there is no danger in the future. As long as we are determined to strive towards the established goal of victory, it can be said that we have already walked more than ninety miles of a hundred-mile journey. Final victory is approaching. We must use the price of blood and flesh to achieve the purpose of resisting the war, to wash away the shame that the traitors have added to our nation! Those who do not know the great righteousness that "traitors and patriots cannot coexist" cannot be considered Chinese! Those who do not aspire to avenge their humiliation and strive for the independence and survival of the country cannot be considered descendants of the Yellow Emperor!</p>
<p>Strive for the welfare of future generations and do not leave a shame on the nation for all time</p>
<p>All the soldiers and compatriots must know that the most important thing for us today is to be determined to never give up and to maintain confidence in the victory of the war. Any war in the world will deepen its difficulties as time goes on, so the more it comes to the end, the more it is necessary to exert stronger and greater perseverance and courage. I do not deny the pain and efforts of our entire military and civilians, but our determination to endure pain and sacrifice must be strengthened with time, and our degree of struggle must be intensified with the continuation of the war. Our pain and sacrifice have the highest value and the most sacred meaning. We want to preserve the glory for our ancestors and create happiness for future generations. If our generation of compatriots can spare no sacrifice, fear no pain, and always be unyielding and persevere to the end, then enduring the pain now will surely be exchanged for the welfare of future generations. Otherwise, if we are afraid of difficulty and seek ease, and vainly hope to be spared, then one day of our comfort will bring eternal shame to the nation and plunge our future generations into the endless pain of slaves and beasts. The × people have used all kinds of tricks, but we are not afraid of difficulties, nor are we afraid of the invaders. Everyone must know that difficulties and dangers cannot be avoided, but only broken through by effort; invaders and foreign troubles cannot be quelled by surrender, but only overcome by struggle. This is the inherent spirit of our Chinese nation, which is not afraid of the strong, and it is also the integrity that our revolutionary soldiers should have in overcoming the enemy and achieving results. As the future of our war of resistance comes into contact with the light day by day, our responsibilities are also becoming heavier. We must be more persevering, more cautious, more diligent, and more earnestly reflect; see if the efforts we have made on the battlefield of resistance meet the requirements? Has it reached the schedule? At the beginning of the third year of the war, we must be determined to stand on our own positions and make the most intense and solid efforts. I do not need to list the specific items one by one. The most important are the following two points:</p>
<p>Mental Mobilization to Enhance Self-Confidence, Military Training to Strive to Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>First, in terms of spirit, we must implement the principle of overall mental mobilization and fully manifest it in our work. We must consolidate unity, strengthen national unity, promote the spirit of hating the enemy, and enhance self-confidence. We must have the awareness that "I am not afraid of ×, × must be afraid of me," and we must have the determination that "there is me without ×, there is × without me." We must be diligent and hardworking, and sweep away the bad habits of following the old ways and perfunctorily dealing with things. Whether in the front or in the rear, we must quickly and surely intensify our work and complete our tasks. Furthermore, we must know that the basic qualification of a modern citizen is to uphold the absolute nature of national power and laws. Especially in times of war, all national laws are as strict as military orders. No one can be outside the scope of the law. The national military and civilians should share the great righteousness of the sacredness of national policy and the sacredness of national law, and consistently follow them from beginning to end, worthy of being the descendants of our ancestors Yan and Huang, and not disgracing the people of the Chinese nation. Second, in the military aspect, the most important thing is to strive for rectification, enrich the organization, strengthen combat power, and improve combat spirit. The soldiers in the front must be more loyal, brave, and enterprising, kill the enemy and achieve results, use the lessons of blood, plan carefully, strive hard, crush the enemy's attempts to advance, and promote the overall collapse of the × army. The guerrillas in the battlefield must cooperate closely with each other and with the local compatriots, drag down the enemy, and attack the enemy. The people in the rear must enthusiastically respond to the call, receive training and enlist in the army. Young people with aspirations should receive military training, join the army, and practically serve the country. All military and political organs must earnestly complete their assigned tasks and enhance the honorable personality of combat effectiveness. All the people must develop the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness, loyalty, bravery, and martial arts.</p>
<p>Accelerate the Pace and Strive for Victory, The Coming Year is a Critical Juncture</p>
<p>All the soldiers and compatriots of the country! Today, the sacrifices of our national military and civilians, their perseverance, and their long-lasting battles have broken the × people's plans and laid the foundation for our victory. At this time when the situation is improving, it is also the most urgent juncture of the war. We must exert our greatest efforts, accelerate the pace of progress, and cross to the other side of victory. The × people have dug their own graves, and we must use our strength to push the × people into the grave. The × people are making their last struggles, and we must make the most violent and final blows against them. The × people must share weal and woe, live and die together, do their best, and exhaust their efforts, fight for the life of the nation, and strive for the survival of the nation. We must know that it is better to die than to live a stolen life. The victory of everyone is the permanent destruction of the country. The peace of slavery is the eternal sinking of the nation. It is better to die killing the enemy than to live in submission. The victory of the war is the welfare of future generations for all time. The honor and disgrace of being a master or a slave, the success or failure of rising or falling, depends on our efforts in the coming year. I hope that all the soldiers and compatriots will use their unforgettable feelings, their persevering endurance, their fiery spirit, and their overwhelming power to fight to the death, to complete the great cause of defending the country, expelling the brutal × people, and restoring our homeland, to wash away the deepening shame and hatred, and to welcome the light of final victory.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Today marks the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. Several writers have discussed the lessons of this conflict for the world and made an assessment. Prime Minister Hiranuma's speech is considered to be Japan's acknowledgment that it cannot achieve its original goals and its intention to end the war early has been crushed. This is a warning to ports with aggressive ideas everywhere. The "Daily Express" commented on the Sino-Japanese War, saying that Japan has completed a great undertaking, which is to promote the complete unification of China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. What price has Japan paid, and what benefits has it gained? The "News Chronicle" stated that if the European political situation were not as it is now, we should have given the Chinese government active assistance. The current resolute resistance of China has prevented the Japanese army from advancing. This is the best time for us to provide financial assistance to China, so that China can achieve victory as soon as possible. The beneficiary is not only China, but also the entire civilized world.</p>

<p>[Every Communication Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma gave a speech to reporters yesterday, expounding Japan's foreign policy. Regarding future British-Japanese negotiations, Hiranuma said that the negotiation issues are limited to the Tianjin incident, but a complete solution is impossible unless Japan's "New Order" established in the Far East is recognized as the principle of negotiation. The Japanese Prime Minister also said that if there is any attempt to contain or undermine this "New Order", Japan cannot cooperate with it. Japan will respect the rights and interests of foreigners in Chinese concessions, but the concessions must strictly maintain neutrality and not interfere in Japanese military operations. Hiranuma admitted that most Japanese people demanded a declaration of war on China in order to enjoy belligerent rights, but said that the time was not yet ripe. Regarding the "rumors" that the United States' attitude towards Japan has improved, Hiranuma said that regardless of whether this news is true or not, Japan has no urgent need to send a special envoy to the United States to improve relations. Regarding Japan's policy towards China, the Japanese Prime Minister said that the puppet government now has considerable "consolidated power", and the establishment of a "new central government" is not far away. Once this "new government" is established, Japan and "Manchukuo" will officially recognize it. This new regime will be based on the principle of autonomy of each province, but what has not been decided now is the issue of the rule of this "federal government", which will be modeled on the United States or Germany, while the Japanese army will still be stationed in Inner Mongolia, North China, and other places that Japan believes are threatened by "communists". As for saying that after the establishment of the "new government", the Japanese army will withdraw completely, it is impossible. The Japanese army's occupation of various places will be semi-permanent. Hiranuma also said that the declaration on Japan's policy towards China issued by the former Prime Minister on November 3 last year will still be effective, and the incidents on the Mongolian-Manchurian border are only cooperation between the Japanese and "Manchukuo" armies. The "Soviet troops" that crossed the border will be driven out of "Manchuria". The Japanese government has decided to do its best to seek a peaceful resolution to disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the problems of Japanese fishing grounds on the Soviet coast and the mining rights for coal and oil on Sakhalin Island. Finally, the Japanese Prime Minister said that the Japanese government will do its best to protect Japan's rights and interests in the Chinese region.</p>

<p>[Seahong News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Minister of the Army Itagaki warned Britain yesterday not to adopt a "pro-Chiang and anti-Japanese" policy again. Itagaki issued a letter to the Japanese people today, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that the Japanese people have not been able to end the "China Incident". Even after the collapse of the "Chiang Regime", Japan must do its best to eliminate the anti-Japanese efforts of third countries to save China, which has become a semi-colony. Japan should stop the "pro-Chiang" actions of various countries. The entire Japan has made a great determination to achieve the goal of "East Asia is for East Asians". Regarding the negotiations between British and Japanese representatives to be held in Tokyo soon, observers believe that this declaration by Japanese Minister Itagaki is more important than those issued by other Japanese dignitaries.</p>

<p>[Seahong News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] On the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, there were no unexpected incidents in Shanghai until the afternoon. The Japanese military authorities had taken extra precautions to prevent the recurrence of the tragedy of two Japanese people being killed last year on this day. All the concessions were almost completely separated by wooden fences and barbed wire. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets, and the entire special police volunteer army and the British, American, and Italian troops were fully armed. The Japanese people here remained silent about the anniversary. The Japanese people gathered at the Japanese cemetery in Shanghai to observe a minute of silence for the fallen soldiers. Various Japanese groups held meetings in restaurants and implemented the "one bowl of rice movement". Japanese students collected scrap metal from various families and sent it back to Japan as raw materials for military industry.</p>
<p>[Seahong News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Regarding "overall mental mobilization", the Japanese government issued an order yesterday that all Japanese people must share the joys and sorrows of the soldiers on the front line on this day, stop cooking for one day, implement the "one bowl of rice movement", and not hold banquets.

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet government submitted a reply to the suggestions of Britain and France on the 3rd of this month. Its content is tantamount to advocating that the scope of this mutual assistance agreement be expanded to include Poland and Turkey and become a mutual assistance agreement. The Soviet Union also agreed to the protection of the independence of the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, but only on the condition that Poland and Turkey give the same guarantees to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet government also advocated that when a country guaranteed by one of the countries concerned is threatened by aggression, the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented. Sources here familiar with the news claim that the British government will give a reply to the Soviet Union within 48 hours.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] According to TASS, Moscow, 6th, according to the official report issued by the headquarters of the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces, on the 2nd, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army, with a large number of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, equipped with about 100 tanks, concentrated in the Nomonhan area southeast of Lake Bel, and under the cover of bombers and fighter planes, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army again invaded the Mongolian border.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 3rd, they suddenly attacked northward from the area outside Nomonhan, penetrated the shores of Yanghu Lake, and attacked the positions of the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces on the east bank of the Halha River, attempting to break through and enter the west bank of the river. The participants in this offensive included the entire 23rd Infantry Division, equipped with an infantry regiment, the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments, and six cavalry regiments. However, the Mongolian "Soviet" Allied Forces have repelled all the Japanese "Manchukuo" troops who suddenly attacked in the area outside Nomonhan, and caused heavy losses to the × people. To the northwest of that area, the Japanese infantry, equipped with no less than 60 tanks, were also repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian cavalry. The west bank of Halahin Bay was forcibly occupied by a small piece of land. As a result of the vigorous counterattack by the Soviet-Mongolian troops and air force, the Japanese troops who had infiltrated the west bank of the Halha River were repelled. On the evening of the 5th, they suffered great losses in the area on the east bank of the Halha River. In the battles of these days, the Soviet-Mongolian artillery destroyed 50 Japanese tanks and damaged eight artillery pieces. About 800 Japanese "Manchukuo" soldiers died, while the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces only lost 100 people and injured 200 people, and damaged 15 tanks and armored vehicles. At the same time, from the 2nd to the 5th, both sides also used a large air force to participate in air battles. In all the air battles that occurred before and after, the Soviet air force always maintained its victory. In the air battles that occurred from the 2nd to the 5th, 45 Japanese planes were shot down, while the Mongolian-Soviet planes lost only 9. According to reports, Kawamoto, the director of the Kwantung Army News Bureau, was dismissed for publishing fictitious and exaggerated news, saying that the Japanese air force had achieved imaginary victories, and was replaced by Colonel Wafuji.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, June 6th] Mr. Shaw of the LAS Company testified in court yesterday regarding the "Thetis" submarine accident, stating that of the four crew members who initially entered the escape chamber, three perished, while one survived. He stated that the reason the escape door could not be opened was due to a crew member panicking during the escape. Once seawater filled the chamber, the crew members donned their breathing apparatus, but the water had already risen above their heads. At this point, it would have been difficult for anyone to see anything and they would have felt submerged. Attempting to open the escape chamber door under such conditions would certainly have failed, as it was necessary to wait until the pressure inside and outside the chamber equalized. The deaths of the three crew members were likely due to their inability to wait for a sufficient amount of time. Anno, the crew member who was rescued, had no difficulty escaping. He even saw other crew members following him into the escape chamber, but why they could not surface remains unclear. Mr. Shaw also stated that it was inappropriate for four people to enter the escape chamber together, as there was insufficient space for the crew members to move freely. Subsequently, the Director of Naval Ordnance testified, stating that test dives for submarines pose no danger whatsoever to the crew, as such dives are the safest part of a submarine's life, being intentionally and unhurriedly performed. Finally, a technician from the LAS Company completed his testimony, and the court announced an adjournment.</p>

<p>— [Special Report from This Newspaper] Gao Shan (Continued from page 8 yesterday)</p>
<p>Fourthly, the development of revolutionary movements within Japan and its colonies. Despite the cruel oppression by the Japanese, these revolutionary movements have already shown significant signs. Within Japan, individuals arrested and killed in the name of being communists or endangering the empire, especially recently those arrested for disrupting economic controls, obstructing social order, and opposing general mobilization laws, are reported daily even in Japanese newspapers, and their numbers are increasing. As for Korea, Taiwan, and the four northeastern provinces, anti-Japanese united fronts have been established one after another. Soldiers from Taiwan, Korea, and the puppet state of Manchukuo have defected on various fronts. The successive occurrence of "riot" incidents in Japan and its colonies fully indicates that the anti-aggression war movement of the people within Japan and the colonial masses will develop actively!</p>
<p>Fifthly, furthermore, what is particularly serious is the development of labor power in Japan, and the intensifying contradictions and conflicts with European and American powers! Last May, Xiamen was forcibly occupied, Guangzhou in October, and Hainan Island this February. In March this year, the Xisha Islands were seized, in May landings were made at Gulangyu, and in June, Tianjin was blockaded, followed by the seizure of Shantou and the blockade of Fuzhou and Wenzhou, resulting in an undeclared war with Britain! Consequently, the Anglo-French Singapore Conference began, and the anti-aggression front began to extend to the Far East, and Japan's international position became increasingly isolated.</p>
<p>(4) Experiences and Lessons from the Past Two Years</p>
<p>The two years of the great war of resistance have left us with glorious historical achievements, and more importantly, with valuable experiences and lessons. How to accept, study, and apply these experiences and lessons, overcome current difficulties, and strive for final victory is our most fundamental task at present.</p>
<p>The two years of heroic resistance have first and foremost proved that those who suffer from Japanophobia, those who rely solely on weapons, and those pro-Japanese traitors who propagate all forms of the theory that resistance is bound to fail are baseless. Our heroic resistance over the past two years has not only prevented our demise but has also enabled us to become stronger with each battle, with increasing morale and progress in all aspects, while Japan, on the contrary, is heading towards collapse. These facts are the best examples. At the same time, it also proves that those superficial, hasty advocates of quick victory are also unfounded; the Japanese aggressors still possess residual power, landing in Shantou and Dinghai, and are eyeing Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Nanning, Guilin, Weisha, Hanzhong, Xi'an, and other places, which are clear examples. The experience of the past two years tells us that this war of resistance against Japan is being waged with the disorganized, unprepared forces of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country against the fully prepared offensive forces of a modern capitalist-imperialist state that has been preparing for sixty years. Therefore, achieving final victory requires a protracted war of resistance and a gradual transition from passive response to active resistance, from resistance by the army and government to a sustained resistance by the entire nation.</p>
<p>The two years of heroic resistance further indicate that to ultimately defeat Japanese imperialism, it is first necessary to earnestly and effectively consolidate the unity of the entire nation and to mobilize all the dynamic and material forces of the entire nation. It is precisely because since the "July 7th" incident, all parties, classes, Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and minority ethnic groups in our country have formed an unprecedented unity, enabling us to overcome all provocations, alienations, compromises, and betrayals by Japanese agents and traitors, to resolutely support the long-term war of resistance, and to achieve victories "beyond Japanese expectations" for as long as two years. It is also precisely because the proposition and policy of mobilizing all the dynamic and material forces of the entire nation to assist the war of resistance have been enthusiastically supported and faithfully implemented throughout the country, enabling us to respond to the war with unprepared and disorganized forces in haste, and to replenish our preparations and organize ourselves in battle, thus allowing us to persist for two years, and our strength has grown stronger. Every compatriot who truly loves the motherland and the independence and freedom of the nation should deeply recognize that consolidating the anti-Japanese national united front with the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation as its foundation is the lifeline of the Chinese nation for defending its territorial sovereignty and striving for survival, independence, freedom, and happiness. Safeguarding this lifeline is the central task of every Chinese who does not want to be a slave!</p>
<p>The two years of heroic resistance further indicate that reforming political organs at all levels, improving national mobilization methods, earnestly promoting democratic politics, and genuinely improving the people's livelihood are the fundamental conditions for achieving the unity of politics, the army, and the people, and are also the fundamental conditions for consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese national united front that unites the entire nation and mobilizing all the dynamic and material forces of the entire nation. They are also the fundamental conditions for finally defeating the Japanese aggressors and establishing a Three Principles of the People republic. We have already begun to implement these conditions in the past two years, which is why we have been able to overcome all difficulties and persist for two years; however, because our implementation is not yet thorough, complete, or in-depth, we have suffered unnecessary and cruel sacrifices and setbacks in the past two years in terms of military affairs and political affairs.</p>
<p>The two years of heroic resistance also indicate that without establishing a modern, mechanized national defense force, without cultivating thousands upon thousands of new cadres who support the war of resistance and national policies, and without striving for broader and more effective foreign aid on the basis of self-reliance, we will not be able to prepare for and conduct the future general counter-offensive and decisive battle, we will not be able to eliminate and drive out the Japanese aggressors from China, and we will not be able to build an independent, free, equal, and happy Three Principles of the People republic. At the same time, it also indicates that although we strive to achieve all of the above, if we do not make efforts to increase the difficulties and crises of the Japanese aggressors, if we do not quickly and extensively develop guerrilla warfare zones and anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines to engage the enemy in military, political, economic, and cultural life-and-death struggles, especially if we do not resolutely and thoroughly strike at Japanese agents, spies, traitors, and Wang Jingwei, and strike at their anti-communist and peace talks propaganda, and strike at their actions that divide and split our united front and shake our national perseverance, and strike at their conspiracy activities to consolidate the puppet regime and use Chinese manpower and resources to conquer China, then our resistance and the Chinese nation's struggle for liberation will still suffer great setbacks.</p>
<p>Over One Hundred Members of the "Japanese Patriotic League" Demonstrated in Front of the British Embassy District, with Posters in the Area Bearing the Phrase "British People Withdraw from the Asian Continent"</p>
<p>[Reuters London, July 7th] In view of the upcoming Tokyo conference between Britain and Japan, the Japanese military authorities in North China have recently restricted the export of goods from North China. According to general observations, this move is another attempt by the Japanese to pressure the British side. Reuters has learned that although Britain is willing to participate in the Tokyo conference with the most sincere attitude, Japan still intends to apply consular certification to all British imports from China. In addition, the Japanese have other methods of pressure. If reasonable means cannot be implemented, then they will consider this kind of economic pressure.</p>

<p>[Reuters Warsaw, July 7th] It is understood that after consultations between the Polish government and Britain and France, a decision has been made regarding the steps to be taken to deal with military preparations in Danzig. Although newspapers reported yesterday that Poland would not send a note to Danzig, the Polish Commissioner in Danzig may urge the Danzig authorities to pay attention to the provisions regarding the self-defense of the free city. The Polish government currently has no intention of arguing with the Danzig authorities regarding the nature of the military preparations in Danzig. It is reported that the Polish government has notified the British and French ambassadors here of its decision to deal with the situation in Danzig.</p>
<p>[Reuters Warsaw, July 7th] A Polish official announced today that Germany officially informed Poland that it would send warships to Königsberg and then to Danzig, intending to calm world opinion, but its purpose is obviously to create internal changes in the Free City of Danzig. The Polish people should pay attention. Therefore, although the current situation is calm, we should be extremely cautious, as Germany's intentions will seriously affect Danzig and Poland's access to the sea.</p>

<p>The Japanese side hoped to make a "sensational move" on the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, establishing a "puppet government" in China with Wang Jingwei as the puppet. Now, it has failed under the united and firm resistance of our entire nation.</p>
<p>However, the conspiracy of Japanese agents and traitors is endless. They are preparing to establish another puppet regime, calling it the "Anti-Communist or Nationalist Party," and in the future, they want to organize an "Anti-Communist Kuomintang Government" (see Reuters Shanghai telegram of July 7th).</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the Japanese are trying in every possible way to scheme against us. What we must be especially vigilant about is those traitors in general, especially those who have not yet become traitors, and even those who are still standing under the banner of "righteousness." These people, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said yesterday to the military and civilians, "do not think that the Japanese are already digging a grave to bury themselves, and they disregard the country and willingly serve as funeral objects for the Japanese!"</p>
<p>The Japanese and Wang Jingwei have now raised the banners of "anti-communism" and "peace," raising the banners of what "Anti-Communist Nationalist Party" and "Anti-Communist Nationalist Party Government" to summon souls! And those crazy people who have lost their self-esteem and self-confidence in politics are also "rejoicing" in their words, jumping around, and doing evil! These kinds of people are not worth pitying if they willingly serve as funeral objects, but as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out in his instructions yesterday, "they even want to use the glorious nation as a funeral object"—this is what our entire nation cannot tolerate—we must unite more strongly, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, give the Japanese agents and traitors and the few crazy and shameless slaves a resolute blow!</p>

<h3 id="e32">Saving Money <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>I Am A Confused Fool</p>
<p>I began to stutter when I walked into the bank. The bank clerk made me stutter, the small window on the counter made me stutter, seeing the money made me stutter, everything made me stutter.</p>
<p>The instant I stepped across the threshold of the bank, intending to deposit money, I became a dazed fool.</p>
<p>I knew this beforehand. But my salary had been raised to fifty dollars a month, and I felt that I should save it in the bank.</p>
<p>So I stumbled in, timidly looking at the bank clerks around me. I thought that a new depositor had to talk to the manager.</p>
<p>I walked up to a small window with the sign "Accountant." The accountant was a tall man with a cold demeanor, and I began to stutter when I saw him. My voice was so mournful.</p>
<p>"Can I, can I see the manager?" I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the accountant said, and asked the manager to come.</p>
<p>The manager was a solemn and quiet person. I clutched the fifty-six dollars in my pocket into a ball.</p>
<p>"Are you the manager?" I said. Heaven knows if I was doubting.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>
<p>"Can I see you," I asked, "privately?"</p>
<p>The manager looked at me with some surprise, thinking that I was going to reveal a big secret.</p>
<p>"Please come in," he said, leading me to a private room and locking the door.</p>
<p>"We won't be disturbed now," he said. "Please sit down."</p>
<p>We both sat down, looking at each other, and I felt unable to speak.</p>
<p>"You must be a detective sent by the detective bureau, I think," he said.</p>
<p>Seeing my mysterious attitude, he thought I was a detective. I knew what he was thinking, which made things even worse.</p>
<p>"No, I am not a detective," I said.</p>
<p>"To be honest," I continued, as if deliberately lying, "I am not a detective. I am here to deposit money. I want to deposit all my money in this bank."</p>
<p>The manager seemed a little relieved, but still very solemn; he now thought I must be the son of some millionaire.</p>
<p>"It must be a large sum," he said.</p>
<p>"Not much," I said softly. "I want to deposit fifty-six dollars first, and then fifty dollars every month."</p>
<p>The manager stood up and opened the door. He called the accountant.</p>
<p>"Mr. Meng Gaomao," he was really cruel, saying it out loud, "This gentleman wants to deposit money. He wants to deposit fifty-six dollars. Good morning." I stood up.</p>
<p>"Good morning," I said, stepping into the vault.</p>
<p>"Come out," the manager said coldly, pointing at the vault and telling me to go out.</p>
<p>I walked up to the accountant's window and quickly pushed the ball of banknotes to him with a brisk motion, as if doing a magic trick. My face was as pale as a ghost.</p>
<p>"Um," I said, "Deposit it." My tone was as if to say, "Hurry up and get this painful thing over with."</p>
<p>He took the money and passed it to another clerk.</p>
<p>He told me to write the amount on a slip of paper and sign my name in a ledger. I no longer knew what I was doing. The bank was spinning before my eyes.</p>
<p>"Is it deposited?" I asked in an empty and trembling voice.</p>
<p>"It's deposited," the accountant said.</p>
<p>"Then I want to write a check."</p>
<p>I meant to withdraw six dollars for use first. A clerk gave me a checkbook. Another clerk began to teach me how to sign. They must have been thinking that I was a useless millionaire. I wrote some words on the check and pushed it to the bank clerk. He picked up the check and looked at it.</p>
<p>"What! Are you going to withdraw it all again?" he asked in surprise. Only then did I realize that I had written fifty-six instead of six. Now I couldn't think anymore. I felt that this matter was inexplicable, and all the bank clerks stopped writing and looked at me.</p>
<p>At this moment, I was so distraught that I disregarded everything and suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Withdraw all of it."</p>
<p>"You want to withdraw the money deposited in the bank?"</p>
<p>"Every penny must be withdrawn."</p>
<p>"Are you no longer depositing?" the clerk said in amazement.</p>
<p>"Never again."</p>
<p>At this moment, I had a delusional hope that they would think that something had insulted me when I signed the check, causing me to no longer deposit. I desperately tried to look like a very impatient person.</p>
<p>The clerk prepared to pay the money.</p>
<p>"What kind of bills do you want?" he said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"What kind of bills do you want?"</p>
<p>"Um"——I understood what he meant, and answered without thinking——"Fifty dollar bills."</p>
<p>"Miss, I can't tell you what. I clearly saw on the ball that you forgot to put money in your bag."</p>

<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt had suffered from severe paralysis. Although he recovered, he remained lame. But he never mentioned his disability. If anyone tried to offer condolences or inquire about his leg ailment, they would be met with an unpleasant reaction.</p>
<p>Once, he was giving a campaign speech in Georgia. As usual, he leaned against the lectern to speak. When he was engrossed in declaring, "If I become president, you will be able to..." he unknowingly moved away from the lectern and lost his balance on the stage. Naturally, this frightened the people both on and off the stage. But when he was helped up, he didn't care at all and continued speaking as if nothing had happened.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Weather Forecast <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the "July 7th Incident." Flipping through the evening newspaper, I saw the headline: "Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong Enthusiastically Commemorate." Walking on the street, what did I see? Very few national flags, very few blue flowers. On display, movie theaters, Cantonese opera houses, teahouses, and restaurants were still crowded. There were charity sales, vegetarian meals, and anti-war propaganda.</p>
<p>Shanghai, a piece of the Republic of China's sovereign territory, on the occasion of "July 7th," British, American, and French troops were all mobilized, and detectives stood guard as if facing a major enemy. Friends, we are much more "comfortable" in "foreign countries," aren't we?</p>
<p>The Tokyo negotiations are faltering. Originally, the Japanese side wanted to "eradicate" the anti-Japanese elements, but now they also say, "The Tokyo negotiations only discuss issues related to Tianjin." After a lot of haggling, how polite they are! What kind of smokescreen is this? The Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been going on for five months. News has come that they are going to issue a declaration to decorate the scene.</p>

<p>He gave me a fifty-dollar bill.</p>
<p>"What about the six dollars?" he asked indifferently.</p>
<p>"Six dollar bills," I said.</p>
<p>He gave me the bills and I rushed out the door.</p>
<p>As the door turned behind me, I heard an echo of hearty laughter. From that time on, I never deposited money again. I put my cash in my trouser pocket and saved my savings in a sock.</p>

<p>Once, a German farmer had a newborn son and wanted to buy a stroller, but he was too poor to afford it. He had a friend who worked in a nearby factory that supposedly made strollers. So he discussed it with his friend, asking him to bring out some parts whenever he could, so that he could assemble them into a stroller.</p>
<p>The friend happily agreed. So, wheels, frames, handles, axles, one by one, were brought out. In just a few days, they were all collected. The friend asked if the stroller had been assembled yet. "No," the farmer said, "I tried to assemble it three times according to what you said, but each time it turned out to be a machine gun."</p>

<p>— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Summary of Previous Chapters:</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the wireless operator for the Qiu克斯 shipping company, and Bill, a mechanic, took advantage of a German ship traveling to Europe. Because England and Germany had declared war, British warships were going to intercept the ship. The ship fled frantically. With great difficulty, it escaped the danger and returned to American territory. Jack and Bill returned to New York to see Qiu. Qiu then asked them to take the "St. Mark" to Europe to find his son. On board, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that this fellow was the German spy named Lavicky...</p>
<p>Thirteen - The Burning Ship</p>
<p>"What's it all about?" Bill continued.</p>
<p>"Oh, he came running; offered me a lot of money to send a coded message for him. I imagine it's about the 'Taini' - reporting on her location."</p>
<p>"Is that the trick he's trying to pull?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he didn't succeed. I was momentarily confused and told him to stop pretending in front of me. And, if he bothered me again, the next British inspector to board the ship, I would point him out."</p>
<p>"And then, what did he do?"</p>
<p>"I think, at that time, he swelled up like a balloon," Jack laughed. "Now, as long as we can expose史可志, we can catch them all in one fell swoop when we want him."</p>
<p>"That won't be easy. They're never together. At least, I've been watching. Lavicky hasn't talked to anyone on this ship."</p>
<p>"No, I guess they're deliberately avoiding each other to avoid suspicion. I wish I could have heard them talking that night, and gotten a good look at him."</p>
<p>"Yes, that would be the easiest and best thing. But, like you said, I don't think either of them will bother us again."</p>
<p>The day passed uneventfully. In the afternoon, they saw a British cargo ship sailing west. Later, they overtook a French oil tanker heading towards Poland. Jack, seeing that they had a small radio transceiver installed, went to ask for recent news. They replied that there were two German cruisers nearby, and the French ship was trying to escape being captured.</p>
<p>At dusk, the wind picked up a bit. The waves were also blown higher. Even the "St. Mark," a large ship, was tossed and turned violently. This was what sailors call a "fresh breeze." But, for those passengers unaccustomed to this, it was considered a considerable storm.</p>
<p>Jack and Bill were happy. Under such a monotonous calm, they preferred a bit of bad weather. After dinner, they went to the lifeboat deck, walking up and down, chatting casually. Inside, on the radio base, Mullen was in charge. As they passed the door, they exchanged a few casual words with him. The second time, Mullen excitedly called out to them.</p>
<p>"There's a ship sending a distress signal!" he shouted.</p>
<p>"A British ship?" Jack exclaimed. "But, what danger could there be in such a place?"</p>
<p>"I don't know yet. I'm trying to listen in. Go report to the captain. Should we go to rescue them?"</p>
<p>"Go immediately!" Jack completed his task in a few minutes and returned to the radio room. The order brought back was: "Rescue!" And to quickly await further reports.</p>

<p>Over the past week, the stock market has seen widespread engagement. Shanghai Bank and general public utility stocks have garnered significant interest from Hong Kong investors, though the market remains unstimulating. Stock prices have risen slightly, with purchase prices generally falling just below the listed prices. Due to recent political uncertainties, stock prices cannot consistently remain at these levels. An increase in demand will inevitably lead to a point of reaction, and various factors can influence this.</p>

<p>— Feng Hefa</p>
<p>(3) Management Principles</p>
<p>The work of the Tea Department is nothing more than completing or fulfilling the goals outlined in the wartime tea policy and executing the aforementioned tasks. However, because it is an organization for local and central cooperation, its nature is questionable. Therefore, I will briefly explain our work approach: First, to promote the central government's unified sales policy. This is the foundation of the tea policy. Without unified sales, it is impossible to talk about achieving the goals of "competing for materials and strengthening finance." Nor can the work of "reducing intermediaries and eliminating bad practices" and "increasing direct trade and exports" be accomplished. Second, to safeguard the interests of farmers and merchants in the province. Only by increasing the interests of farmers and merchants can we enhance their love for the tea industry and further increase their faith in the nation. The foundation of "stabilizing rural areas and improving the tea industry" is also based on this. The way to safeguard is definitely not through blind promotion, but through the adjustment of interest distribution among various levels of production. Only in this way can we talk about improving production, benefiting farmers, "overhauling tea factories, and improving manufacturing." Third, to serve the improvement of the tea industry in this province to the greatest extent. As we know, management and administration should not merely be negative restrictions and constraints on the people, but positive promotion and assistance. The Tea Department itself does not directly or indirectly bear the responsibility for business operations (such as purchasing), nor does it charge any fees. However, entrusted by the central unified sales agency and based on the needs of farmers and merchants in the province, we should handle various matters related to tea industry improvement with a service attitude. We should not be confined to one aspect with the passive work of an administrative agency.</p>
<p>(4) Several Tasks</p>
<p>Based on the above objectives, the work content of the Tea Department is extremely complex. In the initial stage of its establishment this year, preparations were rushed, and it is difficult to execute everything. However, the following points will be promoted step by step to achieve some success:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting Tea Farmer Production - This does not only refer to the production of raw tea leaves. The goal of the tea policy, on the one hand, is to achieve large-scale modern tea factories. On the other hand, it is to simplify and rationalize production relations. Before we can develop national capital and modernize all tea factories, it is crucial to focus on tea making among individual tea farmers to increase their profits. The method is to promote cooperative organizations. The Ministry of Finance has promulgated general organizational rules for tea management agencies in various provinces, listing tea farmer cooperation as a major part of the work. Our province has cooperative work teams responsible for this task, so the Tea Department only needs to maintain close contact with them and promote it together to see results.</p>
<p>(2) Balancing Tea Prices - This is the core of the tea industry improvement problem. On the one hand, it is to protect the reasonable profits of tea merchants. On the other hand, it is to increase the profits of tea farmers. The former is easier to achieve, and the method is to establish a tea price guarantee contract with the Trade Commission and organize an evaluation committee for fair agreement to ensure that tea factories obtain legitimate profits. The latter is the most important task, but tea farmers are too scattered.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Two Years of Literature <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>From July 7, 1937, to today, our motherland has undergone a full two years of battle. For two years, accompanying the real struggles of the motherland, accompanying the great battles of the motherland, our literature has also very powerfully shouldered the mission assigned to it by the times and the nation. In order to awaken the masses from ignorance, in order to strike the enemy from its basic position, it resolutely threw itself into the great vortex of battle, using its various weapons, concentrating various fighters around it, and thus carrying out its arduous and great struggle. Since the May Fourth New Culture Enlightenment Movement, the consistent struggle direction in literature for more than ten years has gained a new development and a new upswing here. Literary struggles in various aspects have been greatly improved, progressed, and achieved more outstanding success and extraordinary expansion than in previous stages. China's emerging combat literature has taken a big step forward in this brand-new era of combat.</p>
<p>The bright battle flag waving in the free sky of the new China is such a powerful call to various types of soldiers in the literary camp. For two years, in the literary struggle, all our literary soldiers have gathered under this great battle flag and completed a more steel-like, stronger, and more consolidated national revolutionary literary united front, absorbing all writers, poets, theorists, playwrights, and the vast number of young literary people, fighting together toward a single goal. The battle slogan and basic creative symbol that form the foundation of a national revolutionary literary united front is "Resistance War Literature." It leads the literary and artistic struggle of the past two years in an agile posture and has become the landmark of the work of all literary and artistic workers, transforming into the most realistic path of today's literary and artistic movement. The Resistance War Literary Movement has already become the most powerful force in our national cultural struggle of the past two years.</p>
<p>The Resistance War Literary Movement is the critical result of the struggle experience of Chinese literature in past eras, and it is an extension of the struggle between "National Defense Literature" and "Mass Literature of the National Revolutionary War" after the "December 9th" Beiping student movement and before "July 7th". It is the purification and realistic deepening of their theories. In other words, it is also a higher and newer stage of Chinese literature. For two years, the increasingly fierce real battles have demanded the continuous advancement of literary battles. The Resistance War Literary Movement has undergone comprehensive development and has many unprecedented achievements in the history of literature, whether in artistic creation or literary theory, poetry, or in content, techniques, forms, popularization, and Sinicization. The combat achievements we have accumulated in the past two years are truly too numerous to mention, and the progress we have made cannot be expressed in a few words.</p>
<p>The development of the Resistance War Literary Movement, like the development of all other literary movements, requires its theoretical guidance. For two years, the new advanced theories of the Resistance War Literature have organically guided it, leading this movement onto the right track of development, and guiding all writers standing at the forefront of this movement with the direction of creation. Therefore, Resistance War Literary Theory has played a major role in the Resistance War Literary Movement of the past two years. Although its own activities are still very weak, and although it shows a great lag compared to the progress of reality and the practice of creation, it has also done a lot of work, such as the promotion of various aspects of Resistance War Literary Theory, the critical review of various aspects of creative routes, the explanation of basic theoretical viewpoints, the liquidation of formalism and formalism, the deepening of the theory of literary popularization, the expansion of the scope of writers' writing, and the critical absorption of local literature, and so on. Of course, these alone are not enough. The deepened and expanded struggles of the past two years can no longer simply satisfy these theories, and these trivial theoretical facts are also unable to meet the needs of today's literary battles. Therefore, stepping forward from the achievements gained in these two years, we need to establish a system of literary theory, establish a complete central method of literary creation and criticism, and need more refined and complete theories.</p>
<p>The main link in our literary struggle in the past two years has undoubtedly been in the aspect of literary creation. Due to the needs of actual combat, our creation has unfolded in infinitely broad aspects in describing the frontal battles. We have produced "A Company Commander's Battle Encounters." In describing the negative decay, we have produced "Mr. Hua Wei." Various pamphlets, novels, poems, and dramas, etc., have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. "Half a Cart of Wheat and Rice," "A Year," "Frontline in the North"... these excellent works are constantly being discovered. All these creative achievements are showing the great struggle we have carried out in literature in the past two years. Although these struggles are a bit lagging behind in the rapid development of reality, more agile and sharper literary creations will undoubtedly continue to be produced in large quantities in the future. The literary struggle in the past two years has well paved the way for our future Resistance War literary creation. Inheriting the development of this road, we should more vigorously strengthen the struggle of our writers' creation and turn our literary mirror towards the struggle for national liberation and the victorious tomorrow of this struggle.</p>
<p>The work of literary popularization is undoubtedly one of the major tasks we have carried out in the past two years. Today, we have seen many achievements in this work. For example, the adaptation of many local operas, drum lyrics, storytellings, and other types of folk songs and children's songs, "old bottles filled with new wine" are all good examples. In the future, we must further expand, improve, and deepen this work, thoroughly refining the essence of literature from popularization, establishing a new type of literature that is completely popular and Chinese, thereby strengthening its combat function.</p>
<p>The two years of literary struggle are unforgettable merits for us. Today, the motherland is still in hardship, and the literary combat mission will not be considered over. Countless missions are waiting for us. Let us fight more bravely! Jin Yi</p>

<p>"Don't call me that."</p>
<p>"Jingwen, why did you come to my side?" She said halfway, turned her face to look at her, and asked in panic, "What, are you injured?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not, I want to come to your side, if we die, we will die together, this really took my life!"</p>
<p>"Can't you see the blood on your face?"</p>
<p>"How can I see it?" Jingwen said, touching it with her hand, crying like a child, "How can I bleed so much? I don't know at all, but it doesn't hurt at all."</p>
<p>Qingzhi also wiped her face for her, "There is no wound," she said reassuringly;</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, you are not injured, you should lie down quietly."</p>
<p>"No, I'm afraid alone, you promised me to be by your side."</p>
<p>Her voice trembled, as if she was about to cry again, Qingzhi was still at a loss.</p>
<p>"Don't be like this, you just lie down here, like me, with both hands flat on the ground."</p>
<p>"It's already on fire over there."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it won't burn over here."</p>
<p>The plane hadn't left yet, it wasn't dropping any more bombs, it was like it was enjoying the evil it had created.</p>
<p>The winter sun shines warmly, the crops in the fields stand tall without fear, the pond water stirs up a wave, then returns to calm. Everything exists smoothly in the middle of heaven and earth, but the cruel magic hand snatches the lives of the innocent, disturbs the calm air, and sets down the fire of destruction.</p>
<p>The fire burned cracklingly, she thought, "Why doesn't it burn bigger, burn those planes in there too." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Reading "Chen Ershitou" <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Han Bo</p>
<p>Serialized in Literary Front No. 23</p>
<p>"Chen Ershitou" is labeled as "speech literature," which is indeed "a fresh thing." In order to avoid all material limitations, and to use the storytelling form, is a light cavalry team of literary popularization. Because this form is easy to understand and close to the people, it will inevitably be accepted by a large number of literate or illiterate masses (because it is a speech, illiterate people can also appreciate the benefits). We analyze its content, etc., in addition to literary evaluation, we should especially focus on its effect, because this is the only "legacy" it inherits from the form.</p>
<p>In the writing process, Mr. Hu Kao undoubtedly spent a lot of effort. There are too many things to consider. The lack of colloquial language (such as "a throat," "Na," etc. are all invented by himself), and the need for a lively and relaxed style to facilitate speeches and attract the masses, are all very obvious. Now, just in terms of creating this kind of "speech literature," it can be said that it has achieved considerable success. It has a beginning and an end, has a gag that can make people laugh, has some unambiguous folk-familiar life experiences, and has vivid colloquial words. The result also achieved the theme and ending of telling this story that is not legendary - Chen Ershitou's house was burned down by the devils, his wife and daughter were bombed to death, and he turned from a farmer to a "team" guerrilla, ending the story.</p>
<p>The full text of more than 20,000 words, just like ordinary storytelling, has one line to the end, without any "twists and turns." Even the little devils will not open their mouths in ignorance. In order to strengthen the tone, it often does not hesitate to repeat sentences to achieve the purpose. This is also a common technique used by ordinary storytellers, like one of the paragraphs: (To be continued) Pearl River</p>
<h3 id="e44">Starting from "Article Charity Sale" <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Pearl River</p>
<p>Our publication, from the 8th to the 10th of this month, responded to the "Literary Association's" article charity sale donation campaign. All manuscript fees will be donated for the purpose of rescuing wounded soldiers. This movement has two meanings: First, it shows the writers' enthusiastic donations; second, it shows the sincere cooperation between the pen and the gun.</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Resistance War, there has been a most popular and crucial saying, which is "Those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money." Our supreme leader has repeatedly and earnestly explained to the people: "This Sino-Japanese war is a final competition of the two countries' manpower, financial resources, and material resources. If we have the strength to support ourselves longer in terms of manpower, financial resources, and material resources, we will be able to achieve victory." This so-called manpower includes both labor and mental effort. The effort made by writers is naturally a kind of mental effort. Now, writers contribute their mental effort, write articles that are beneficial to the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and dedicate the price they should receive for these articles—manuscript fees—for the purpose of rescuing wounded soldiers. This can be said to be contributing both manpower and financial resources. Therefore, this article charity sale movement can very well demonstrate the writers' patriotic spirit, fulfilling the entire saying of "Those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money."</p>
<p>Secondly, this article charity sale movement has a more profound meaning, which is the demonstration of sincere cooperation between the pen and the gun. Galloping on the front lines and striking the remaining enemies is the mission of the gun; boosting morale in the rear and supporting the war of resistance, this is the task of the pen. Therefore, the gun and the pen each have their own positions in the war of resistance. Now, the proceeds of the pen—manuscript fees—are used to rescue wounded soldiers, so that the wounded soldiers can recover their vitality, re-wield the gun, and fight desperately with the enemy. Isn't this using the pen to support the gun, demonstrating the sincere cooperation between the pen and the gun?</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that writers, in this article charity sale movement, should more thoroughly realize the importance of their own tasks and earnestly carry out their own work. Now, based on what I can think of, I offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>First, we must severely criticize the pro-Japanese theory. Since the Wang Jingwei clique betrayed the country, some newspapers and publications that spread pro-Japanese theories have been found in the country. This has an unfavorable impact on the future of the war of resistance. I believe that writers should, on the one hand, launch fatal attacks on the theories of the traitors; on the other hand, they should elaborate on the reasons why the war of resistance will surely win and the country will surely be built, in order to strengthen the people's confidence.</p>
<p>Second, we must have a solemn writing attitude. Articles about romance and trivial matters can be avoided altogether. The reason for this is very clear. This era is definitely not for writing articles about romance and trivial matters. For writers, it is misusing their mental effort on useless or even harmful things; for readers, it is wasting their energy, or even demoralizing their will. Therefore, in the process of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, writing such articles is a harmful undertaking, whether viewed from the perspective of the author and reader, or from the standpoint of the country and nation. This is something that writers who generally hold a playful attitude towards writing should seriously reflect on.</p>
<p>Third, the scope of writing should be multifaceted. At present, most writers' themes are concentrated on "War of Resistance," which seems a bit narrow. The "July 7th" incident, which was launched the year before last, was naturally the beginning of the "War of Resistance" on the one hand; on the other hand, it was also the beginning of "National Reconstruction." This "National Reconstruction" is a permanent undertaking, and it must be carried out in many ways. Political, economic, educational, scientific... improvements are all included. Therefore, we should conduct detailed research and elaboration on all social and natural sciences related to national reconstruction. I believe that simply writing about the theme of "War of Resistance" is still insufficient. I hope that writers will put more effort into other aspects.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic and solemn atmosphere shows a bright future. The solemn and great "July 7th" War of Resistance and National Reconstruction two-year anniversary commemoration, yesterday Hong Kong's million compatriots, in accordance with the central government's promulgated methods, held a grand commemoration. It is estimated that there were dozens of industrial groups, including industrial sector gatherings, holding flag presentations, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce's entire staff held a public memorial service, the Kowloon community organizations and schools jointly held a public memorial service, the China Youth Journalists Association and other three cultural groups held a joint commemoration, the South China film industry and Cantonese opera industry held national oaths. Those who held individual commemorations included the Women's Association, the Women's Temperance Association, the Student Relief Association, and overseas Chinese gathering to participate everywhere were extremely enthusiastic, the situation was warm, and the atmosphere was tense. In terms of action, compatriots from all walks of life unanimously observed the flower-wearing and vegetarian movement. Merchants dealing in beef, mutton, pork, and fresh fish all closed for one day, all Hong Kong restaurants and teahouses were all vegetarian, some entertainment venues stopped operating, and some performed for one day, saving on food and donating money, and enthusiastically held charity sales and donations. All the Hong Kong opera singers held a charity performance at the Sincere Department Store rooftop and the Wen Yuan Restaurant in the evening. The various parties' savings on food, donations, and contributions were handed over to relief organizations to handle relief or remitted to the central government. It is expected that the results will be considerable. The various situations yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers by All Sectors</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, community organizations and schools from Hong Kong and Kowloon held a public memorial service for the martyrs and fallen comrades at the Kowloon School's sports field on Barron Road. Those who attended included Xu Shiying, Gao Tingzi, and representatives from community organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon, totaling several thousand people. The memorial address of the assembly stated, "On July 7th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the two-year anniversary of the July 7th commemoration and the War of Resistance, the colleagues of the Hong Kong and Kowloon community organizations and schools' commemorative assembly, with incense, flowers, and clear wine, pay tribute to the spirits of the fallen soldiers at the front and the deceased compatriots, and express our condolences. The words say, 'The Yellow Sea is vast, the mainland is boundless, the Lugouqiao incident has not ended, a full-scale war of resistance, our martial might is promoted, the sacrifices are heroic, the righteous spirit shines brightly, for two years now, the public's will is firm, thinking of the deceased, how can we not be saddened, we, the rearguard, strive to contribute, fresh flowers pay tribute, words are heavy with awe, alas, enjoy the offering.' The elegiac couplet said, 'In the dust of four hundred million people, resist violence and exterminate the strong, heroic sacrifice, you are the pioneers,' 'In the history of the Eastern Hemisphere, promote the national destiny of mankind, the responsibility for glorious undertaking lies with future generations.'"</p>
<p>Industrial Groups Hold Flag Ceremony</p>
<p>Dozens of industrial groups held a flag presentation at the Kowloon Jixian General Labour Union at nine o'clock, paying tribute to the soldiers at the front. Those who participated included representatives from the industrial groups, numbering several thousand people. Xu Shiying, representing He Xiaozhen, and Zhang Yimo, representing, came to receive the flags, and He Xiaozhen and Zhang Yimo delivered speeches. The general idea was that when we commemorate the "July 7th War of Resistance and National Reconstruction two-year anniversary," we should recognize the current environment, and shoulder the current responsibilities. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once instructed, "The war of resistance has progressed to today's stage, the rear is more important than the front, the people are more important than the army." It can be seen that the responsibility of us in the rear is important today. I hope everyone will work harder to achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Commemorates Martyrs</p>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a "July 7th" commemoration meeting at the association at twelve noon, and commemorated the anti-Japanese war martyrs and dead compatriots. Hundreds of people attended the meeting. After the ceremony, Chairman Li Xing spoke. The general idea was that today we are holding a meeting to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We should express our deep admiration for the national heroes who sacrificed themselves for our country, and we should have passionate hope for our country. Recalling today two years ago, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the enemy always thought that they could occupy our entire country in a short period of time, and subjugate our entire people. How could they know that after two years, the enemy's hopes have become a dream. Although our country is inevitably losing cities and territories, and our soldiers and civilians are dying, the whole country is united and the more we fight, the more courageous we become, and the more we fight, the stronger the anti-war strategy becomes. This is all due to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's effective command and the sincere unity of the people across the country, and it is also due to the martyrs who faced death as if returning home and stepped forward to defend the country, so they could inspire the entire army and people to go to righteousness together without fear, so we can persist in the war of resistance, and victory is more assured. We commemorate the martyrs today and should absolutely abide by their will, concentrate our strength, and concentrate our sincerity. We should recognize the principle that the country is above all and the nation is above all, and then shoulder the responsibilities that citizens should fulfill in order to complete the unfinished work of the martyrs. Then the day of restoring the integrity of today's fragmented mountains and rivers will soon come. I hope that our fellow overseas Chinese will encourage each other.</p>
<p>Various Groups Hold Oaths</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Association held a meeting at the association at 10:00 am to commemorate "July 7th" and hold an oath-taking ceremony. Madam Luo Wenjin, Zheng Hongnian, Guo Li Furong and dozens of other people attended. After the ceremony, Chairman Guo Li Furong delivered a speech, followed by the oath, which was supervised by Zheng Hongnian. After the oath, Zheng gave a speech, expressing optimism about the military's increasingly brave and victorious future in the past two years of the war of resistance. Finally, Madam Luo Wenjin delivered a speech, saying that after taking the oath, we must actually implement it in order to live up to the good intentions of the leaders.

<p>The Taikoo steamer Pacific arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning from Australia. En route when it was sailing near Brisbane, it discovered a small boat adrift in the sea. At the time, the pilot boat happened to be sailing by, so it accompanied the Pacific in towing it back to Brisbane. Later, it was found that the boat had been missing for many days. The boat was carrying 11 merchants and a child, who had taken the boat for a cruise on a holiday. It is unknown how the accident occurred. They had not returned for several days. The local government had searched for them everywhere with boats and airplanes, but there was no trace of the boat. By the time the Pacific steamer discovered it that day, all 12 people in the boat had been taken by Poseidon.</p>

<p>Over the years, several nautical adventurers have attempted to cross the Atlantic and Pacific to America from Hong Kong in Chinese-style sailing boats, but they have all failed.

Recently, Meng Tieff, an employee of the President Coolidge Line, wanted to build a Chinese sailing boat in Aberdeen, Hong Kong, to try again (to fulfill the unfulfilled ambition of Richard Halliburton), cross the Pacific to America, and carry a batch of Chinese antiques and hair to participate in the Golden Gate Exposition. The boat is 60 feet long and luxuriously equipped, with a shower room. Meng has extensive navigation experience and has crossed the Pacific dozens of times on the President Coolidge Line.</p>

<h3 id="e50">"July 7th" in Kowloon <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Latter</p>
<p>Under the initiative and call of the Cultural Enterprise Society, community organizations and schools in Kowloon, like community organizations in other regions, expressed their ardent feelings and surging emotions to the two-year anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, issuing their heroic roars and promoting their spirit of loyalty to the motherland.</p>
<p>Groups of young men and women, like thousands of soldiers and horses, surged towards the Kowloon Tong School sports ground. This square was surrounded by lush green youths, and the ground was covered with soft green grass. In the not-too-distant distance, rows of green hills and ridges were clearly visible. The historical site was lined with magnificent Western-style houses, like a flock of cranes standing in the wilderness. No miscellaneous people could be found here, which could be said to be a secluded and elegant scenic spot. However, when countless people unprecedentedly caused a commotion and shouted loudly here, it broke through the dull atmosphere of the mountains and fields and forever left traces of commemorating the glorious battle of the nation.</p>
<p>The fiery sun was radiating its golden light on the square, showing a hot atmosphere. People in this hot atmosphere were holding their chests high, raising their heads, and baring their muscles, all for the sake of winning a breath for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>At about 10 o'clock, the bell rang, the music was played, and the meeting officially began. The members of the presidium on the podium and the guests all successively spoke about their support for the great leader, support for the united front, insistence on the war of resistance, and opposition to the language and propositions of the peace advocates. The choir also responded to the entire audience with their loud voices. These young people, with their foreheads covered in sweat, and many frail children, could not withstand the excessive heat of the sun and fainted. They were like wounded little soldiers, and the Peninsula Nursing Team was very busy rescuing them, and they were able to recover their demeanor with great difficulty.</p>
<p>After the speeches and singing ended, an even more solemn ceremony began. It was a public memorial service for the soldiers who died at the front. First, cannons were fired, mourning music was played, wreaths were presented, and then the chairman read the memorial text. A series of loud sound waves, sad but also inspiring and exciting words, deeply struck the hearts of everyone. Finally, a child named Liang Weiwen from the middle school choir sang a solo song called "The Lugou Bridge Song." His pure and loud voice, and his melodic intonation, immediately created a joyful atmosphere around the entire venue. This is precisely the only sign of the excellent children of the Chinese nation, and the new force of the Chinese nation, which cannot be defeated, is being cultivated.</p>
<p>After the meeting in the square ended, people, in groups and teams, did not feel tired at all, and competed with the sun, walking step by step on the road, and like an expedition, went to the Yaumatei First Theatre to hold a "July 7th" vegetarian lunch conference. The hall was full of people. Bowls of sweet potato and mustard soup were carried by many waiters, dripping with sweat, and offered to people to drink and eat. It was a meeting that was more interesting than eating chicken and meat. Without two years of resolute war of resistance, there would never have been a vegetarian conference today. Everyone laughed and drank happily together, but it was also because people had such ardent feelings to write this glorious epic that it embodied the greater promise of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>After the vegetarian meal, the drama troupe of the Youth Federation, a flower of the youth drama world, set up their formation, sounded the bugle of combat art, and performed a one-act play entitled "Unwilling to be Submissive People." The performance of this one-act play enhanced the solemn, tense, and lively atmosphere of the entire venue, and further encouraged the hearts of people who were hating and killing the enemy. Although the plot was short, the language and actions of the performers were like a storm, like thunder and lightning, vividly portraying the tense situation. The effects it achieved were sufficient to grasp the significance of this day, the "July 7th" anniversary. The central content of this play was that people who were unwilling to be submissive people wanted to continue to kill the enemy. The performance touched the hearts of the audience at the meeting and achieved the effect of artistic propaganda.</p>
<p>At about 3:00 pm, the meeting adjourned, and people happily returned to their respective homes, bringing with them the satisfying, joyful, and glorious fruits of this day.</p>

<p>The Sham Shui Po Children's Summer Camp was recently established at the Qiangzhong School on Fuk Wing Street in Sham Shui Po. It uses the children's leisure time during the summer vacation to implement collective training, improve children's interest in extracurricular learning, and cultivate their inherent moral, intellectual, physical, and social abilities. Therefore, the group's outdoor activities are more important than indoor teaching, and practical knowledge is more important than book knowledge. At the same time, it provides group guidance, with each group being responsible by a specialized instructor. The subjects include vernacular Chinese, English, mathematics, and common knowledge (focusing on life and wartime common knowledge). Extracurricular activities include anti-war drama, salvation songs, little teacher service, swimming, ball games, morning exercises, travel, mountain climbing, and various problem seminars. This collective self-education method has been tried in Peiping and Guangzhou with great results, but it is still an innovation in Hong Kong. It is expected that satisfactory results will be achieved.</p>

<p>Hong Kong's young cultural workers, standing on the same battle line – "Youth Journal," "Cultural Association," and "China Art" – jointly held a commemorative meeting at the Central Theatre at nine o'clock yesterday morning. They used close unity and close cooperation to welcome the arrival of this sacred national liberation.</p>
<p>Time slipped away, and amidst everyone's eager anticipation, Mr. Wang Lengzhai, the fighter of this national liberation revolution, finally arrived. Chairman Xu Dishan and _. 'Stand up and explain the reason for today's meeting;' It is even rarer today for this commemorative meeting to have Mr. Wang Lengzhai, the hero who fired the first shot of the War of Resistance and raised the banner of national liberation in Wanping City two years ago, narrate his heroic story. After an introduction by _You Nu, Mr. Wang Lengzhai stood up amidst applause. He was wearing a white velvet suit and white leather shoes that day, matching his gaunt and square face. The two whiskers on his upper lip _ his demeanor was unrestrained. If _ he had not seen his pair of awe-inspiring and powerful eyes, you would have believed him to be a scholar. He spoke gently and sincerely, and his unwavering and righteous spirit overflowed from his words.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, he spoke very slowly and often made small pauses, his eyes, revealing a majestic light, shot straight forward, as if he was recalling _ the glory and greatness of raising the torch of the national liberation war two years ago today. Against all expectations, two years ago today, he was able to attack the _ people and ignite the raging fire of the War of Resistance. Now the entire Chinese nation is following in his heroic footsteps and embarking on the road to victory. The glory created by this national revolutionary fighter will continue _ for generations to come. _ Then, he said: "Two years ago today. _ People _ fired a cannon into the county government offices of Wanping City. _ A small house, but _ this cannon ignited the raging fire of the Chinese nation's struggle for liberation. Today. I believe that commemorative meetings are being held all over the country, and everyone is filled with fiery passion. This flame will continue to burn until the Chinese nation shines brightly _already."</p>
<p>He continued to explain in detail, "The _ people's conspiracy to swallow the entire China, because of the _ people's arrogance and rampage at Lugou Bridge, fabricated the false claim that Japanese soldiers were missing and used it as an excuse _ , and made various unreasonable demands. _ They _ refused, so the conflict arose. The _ people first attacked _ and fired their guns to sweep at us. The future development _ the result is still unpredictable, but at that time, it was truly impossible to endure and we had to rise up and resist." When he said this, his voice became particularly heavy, as if he was bringing out the resolute attitude he had two years ago.</p>
<p>Then he said, "The _ people's deception _ and blackmail are simply the most cunning and faithless people in the world. Two years have passed since the War of Resistance, and although the _ people's manpower, financial resources, and material resources have been exhausted, their arrogant warlords are still boasting of victory. How could he make peace with us? His release of peaceful air has a purpose: first, to confuse the world's hearing and vision; second, to divide domestic unity; third, to relax everyone's resolve; and fourth, to relax our military preparations. Just like the Lugou Bridge Incident two years ago, so we must not be fooled by him.</p>
<p>"We don't want to be slaves of a conquered nation. Even more, we don't want to be traitors. Being a traitor is more painful and less free than being a beggar!" he said in an alert tone.</p>
<p>"Let us all unite, support our highest leader, revive the nation, and reclaim the rivers and mountains we have lost!" Applause warmly sent him back to his seat.</p>
<p>Then, a telegram to Chairman Chiang and the front-line soldiers was approved, and everyone applauded enthusiastically. Then, the China Choir performed patriotic songs, anti-_ songs, guerrilla songs, and the Song of the Eight Hundred Heroes. "China will not perish! China will not perish!" Will not perish! Will not perish! Will not perish! The song resounded through the sky, and everyone felt their blood rushing.</p>
<p>The "China Art" finale of the play "Dawn" was very brilliant. The intense and solemn emotions filled the scene, causing people to shed tears of inspiration!</p>

<h3 id="e56">Chiang Kai-shek's Letter to the Japanese People: Announcing the Crimes of the Arrogant Japanese Warlords <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— (From yesterday's Second Edition)</p>
<p>When you invade, we naturally resist Japan, and consider you the aggressors. If you abandon the invasion and are willing to reconcile, we can naturally consider you friends. Isn't this obvious? As for creating a pro-Japanese government, may I ask, how can the government of the Republic of China allow foreign troops to forge one? Within the occupied territories, your military can indeed recruit a very small number of Chinese traitors and organize some puppet organizations. But these organizations are, after all, appendages of your invading army, not independent political organs. No matter how your military tries to whitewash and deceive our entire nation, we will always recognize these organizations as belonging to the invaders, and the puppets as traitors. Therefore, they can only deceive the Japanese, but not the Chinese.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is the Will of the Entire Chinese Nation</p>
<p>Finally, regarding myself personally, I know that you warlords have aimed your arrows at me, which is only natural. Since you want to conquer China, you naturally hate the Chinese commander. Therefore, this matter needs no further discussion. However, I advise you not to think that by defeating a certain person, you can defeat China. This is absolutely wrong. I remember that a few years ago, your warlords distributed pamphlets saying, "Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest obstacle to the Empire's continental policy." That's right, I am indeed resisting those who invade China with all my might, and I am an obstacle. But you must realize that the Chinese nation is truly united and has real talent. I am resolutely resisting the war in my capacity as commander-in-chief. In the future, even if another person, or even a hundred people, are replaced as commander-in-chief, they will also resolutely resist the war. You must know that the great future of the Republic of China is guaranteed by countless loyal and brave soldiers and civilians, and it is definitely not supported only by a few people in leadership positions! I also want to tell you: I am truly full of grateful optimism about the future of our nation. Because after two years of arduous war of resistance, every officer and soldier on our front lines, and every person working on the war of resistance in various places, has mostly reached the peak of morality in their spirit. To be honest, I myself can only be said to be able to represent the spirit and will of the entire army and the people from all walks of life today, to carry out the great task of resisting the war and saving the country. At the same time, I firmly believe that our countless rising talents will definitely be better than those currently in charge in every sense in the future. Therefore, Japanese people, you must recognize the greatness of the Chinese nation and not misunderstand the issue.</p>
<p>(2) Announcing the Crimes of Japanese Warlords Enslaving the Peoples of East Asia</p>
<p>What I have said above has roughly exposed the truth about several types of deceptive propaganda, but it is still not enough, because many Japanese people know that such propaganda is false. However, another point is easier to believe, which is that "Japan can actually conquer China and defeat China's independence." The general Japanese public also knows that invasion is bad, but they believe that no matter what, being able to control China and occupy the mainland is always beneficial to Japan. After two years of invasion war, this delusion has probably awakened a lot, but it is still not thorough—so I think it is necessary to reveal two points to you: one point is that the invasion of your warlords is bound to fail; our self-defense is bound to succeed.</p>
<p>Another point is that our success is definitely not the failure of the Japanese people, but the failure of your warlord policy is the success of your people. This reason requires many words to explain. I will first explain a basic point, that is, your country, under the guidance of the wrong ideas of the warlords, has consistently committed serious crimes against the peoples of East Asia. This is the root cause of the inevitable failure of this war of aggression against China. And you Japanese people are now just beginning to suffer the consequences. To what extent will this retribution develop? It is impossible to predict now.</p>
<p>The Shallowness and Ridiculousness of the Japanese Military's Understanding</p>
<p>The serious error of your warlords' thinking is especially despising the neighboring East Asian nations. After the Meiji Restoration, your country's fortune progressed, and you forgot thousands of years of history and became arrogantly self-important, despising backward neighboring countries. This kind of thinking was especially promoted and encouraged by the warlords, thus anesthetizing the people and creating the idea of ​​omnipotent force and omnipotent invasion. In fact, this is your greatest misfortune! I can tell you that China and Japan are absolutely different. You are guided by the wrong ideas of the warlords, and you only talk about strength and weakness in everything, and don't talk about right and wrong. You look at foreign countries completely using armed strength to calculate. You have the greatest respect for the strongest, second greatest respect for the second strongest, you plan to deceive the weak, and you want to swallow the unarmed in one gulp. This is because the warlords you are obsessed with only talk about force when discussing world affairs. They spend all day calculating who has how many cannons, how many airplanes, how many warships, and how much military industry and resources. They use the amount of military force as a representative to measure the value of each country and nation. In the hearts of your warlords, any nation with weak military force should submit to the strong; if it is a nation without any arms, it is not considered human, and should be a slave. This is the basic philosophy of your warlords. Because the world is too big, and the power of Japan cannot reach the weak and small countries far away, the conquering desire of the Japanese ruling class can only be exerted on the weaker neighbors first, and the tragedy of East Asia has developed in this way. Regarding this point, Chinese thinking is fundamentally different. In our minds, all nations are equal and should be free. For example, the strength and prosperity of the Japanese and Koreans are worlds apart, but in our view, they are all equal people. We cannot fear the Japanese because Japan is a so-called first-class power, nor can we look down on the Koreans because they are people of a weak country. On the contrary, we hate the invaders who believe in omnipotent force, and we sympathize with the oppressed small nations. Simply put, the Japanese only talk about strength and weakness, while we only talk about right and wrong. This point is very important.</p>
<p>The People of Korea and Taiwan Under the Iron Heel</p>
<p>Now let me announce the crimes of your warlords! You tore up the treaty with China that respected Korean independence and swallowed Korea. For thirty years, we have been unable to advise or intervene, but we have coldly watched your country despise Koreans as beggars to this day, without giving them any political freedom, and gradually devouring them commercially, turning Korean rich men into poor households, and ordinary people have fallen into exile. For more than ten years, Korean people have fled to our Northeast provinces to make a living, all because they lost their fields in their hometowns and were forced to flee. There are also many unemployed Koreans who are forced to engage in smuggling in Tianjin and other places, doing all kinds of evil. Although we hate their behavior, we cannot help but sympathize with their situation. As for the enslavement education and severe suppression policies in Korea, there is no need to go into detail. In short, the Korean people are in a state of slavery, and the situation in Taiwan is similar. Your warlords have enslaved Korea and Taiwan, and further want to enslave the great Chinese nation. The first stage is to occupy our Northeast four provinces.</p>
<p>The Tragic Encounter of Compatriots in the Northeast</p>
<p>Japanese people with knowledge can carefully and calmly look at how our people in the Northeast four provinces have been living for the past eight years? In summary, in politics, your Kwantung Army wields the autocratic power of life and death. Our compatriots can only obey and cannot speak. In economics, the large businesses of Chinese people have all been occupied, and many farmers' land has also been confiscated. Our compatriots have completely lost their freedom in law in everything related to trade, production, residence, and transportation. Not to mention political rights and educational rights. In these eight years, I don't know how many good people have been killed arbitrarily. The most cruel thing is that they can kill for no reason, based solely on anger, and call it ideological corruption. Simply put, just because they don't like the way someone looks, they should be killed. Speaking of education! It's even more chilling. Your ancestors of the Yamato nation, in the past two thousand years, once enthusiastically read Chinese history and gained a lot of lessons or experiences. Now your warlords are asking our people in the Northeast to forget Chinese history. Isn't this a kind of repayment? In short, your warlords completely do not regard our people in the Northeast as human beings who should live equally, but completely regard them as lowly and damned slaves. Now they only want them to do hard labor and serve, and in the future they want to make them poorer and more foolish, and finally destroy and oppress them to the point of self-destruction.</p>
<p>The Vicious Conquest Policy of the Japanese Warlords</p>
<p>The crimes of your warlords enslaving the peoples of East Asia, if described in detail, cannot be exhausted in 100,000 words. But I think it is not necessary to describe it in detail, because I believe that the Japanese people with knowledge must know more and deeper than we do. Now I will only explain one main point, that is, what are the consequences of this extremely bad conquest policy for all nations? What impact does it have on Japan itself? First, from the first part, the possible results are indeed very terrible. Because the purpose of this policy is not only to destroy the country, but also to destroy the nation. In other words, even if they are willing to be people of a fallen country, they cannot survive. The most basic element of the survival of a nation is economic freedom; the policy of the Japanese warlords is precisely to reduce the economic freedom of the oppressed nations. Taking our people in the Northeast as an example, if this continues, in a few years, they will be completely reduced to coolies and serfs. After the invaders monopolize industry and commerce, the people's livelihood is only left with agriculture, and the ownership of the land is gradually eroded or confiscated, and the agricultural products of farmers cannot be sold freely, and agricultural products must be sold cheaply, while all daily necessities must be bought back at high prices. This kind of layer-by-layer exploitation, big and small, will completely make ordinary farmers lose their fields and fall into the situation of serfs in a few years. What we are most heartbroken about is that under this policy of Japan, the people of East Asia will gradually become poorer and more foolish, and finally tend to perish. And the foolishness mentioned here is not simple foolishness, but stubborn and shameless foolishness, because the Japanese military and administrative authorities encourage stubbornness and shamelessness in education and administration. They want to make the conquered people only know how to fear Japan, the more shameless the better, the more bad things they do the better, and the more they lose their moral concepts the better. The purpose is to make the people a mass of loose sand, father and son not conspiring, friends not helping each other, only knowing how to kneel to the strong and beg for their lives. In short, the Japanese warlords want to teach the East Asian nations to completely lose the moral concepts of Eastern culture and become a complete slave society. And the Japanese warlords are not at ease with this, and they want to add drug policies and prostitution policies. Because they are jealous of the fact that some of these conquered people still have assets, and they are afraid that these people will have different ideas because of boredom and pain, so the first thing your army does in the places it occupies is to reward or force people to smoke opium, heroin, and opium, and at the same time encourage prostitution and gambling. This is to teach these conquered masses to get poor and die quickly, and at the same time, use the power of drugs and prostitution to anesthetize and soften these people, so that they forget their country and nation, forget everything, and have no energy and spirit to extricate themselves from the darkness. Your warlords' policy, from one point of view, can be said to be clever; but from another point of view, it is really pitifully ignorant.</p>
<p>One of the Japanese Warlords' History of Failure</p>
<p>Please take a look at the impact of Japan's own lowly policies. Then you can know that the ones that suffer the most in the future will be Japan itself! Japan's policy, in a nutshell, is to forget its roots; people who forget their roots are bound to fail. Japan, China, and other East Asian nations were originally equally backward countries from the perspective of modern Western scientific civilization; while Japan's Restoration was half a century earlier, your warlords became arrogant and thought that they were the only superior race in Asia, and regarded other races as inferior races. This is really easy to fill because of its smallness, without the demeanor of a great country. The Chinese Revolution and the Japanese Meiji Restoration are two major events for the East Asian nations, but the Japanese warlords only boast about themselves and obliterate China, regarding China as something that can be annexed like Korea. However, China is a little bigger, so they think that if they use a hand-eating method and divide it into several times, they can continue to annex it. Therefore, the first step is to occupy the Northeast four provinces, and the second step is to invade Hebei and Chahar provinces, thinking that they can succeed without a fight by relying on Japan's military force. Even if China resists, it is very easy to eliminate China's resistance. That's right! The Japanese military experts are very precise in calculating the number of flying cannons. They calculate that China cannot beat Japan, and there is indeed a scientific reason for it. It's just a pity that they can calculate everything, but they haven't calculated people's hearts. They have only read half a century of Japanese Restoration history, at most some Western science books and war history from the past few centuries, and they have unexpectedly annihilated the 5,000-year history of China, which your ancestors have read thoroughly, negated the authority of Chinese national culture, and the development of the Chinese revolution in recent decades. With that little bit of military knowledge, they think that military force is omnipotent, and all problems in the world can be solved arbitrarily. They don't know that what really befriends the world is the power of moral culture, not human cannons and airplanes. Objectively speaking, it is really a misfortune for the Japanese nation! I can point out that your warlords have never had half a point of respect and love for China and other East Asian nations; they will annex whatever can be annexed; they will invade whatever can be invaded. For many years, there have been differences in the speed of progress towards China, but the reason for their slow progress is still calculated from a military perspective. They are polite to the United States and the West, but not to us. Just think, forty years ago, because of the interference of other countries, they returned Liaodong to us. If there was no interference, would they be willing to do so? In fact, they wanted to occupy Beijing at that time. China was really scattered and unable to strengthen itself in the late Qing Dynasty. Under the protection of the balance of power of the powers, Japan did not dare to be unique because of its lack of wings. Therefore, after the Russo-Japanese War, it still returned Southern Manchuria to China. However, as soon as the war started, it immediately took out the Twenty-One Demands. Therefore, the speed of the Japanese warlords' aggression against China completely depends on the international situation. In other words, they are always calculating the comparison between Japan's military force and the military force that the powers can use in East Asia: at the Washington Conference, they calculated that they could not defeat Britain and the United States, so they limited the scope; while the September 18th Incident was because they relied on the progress of their navy, and saw through that Britain and the United States would not unite, so they used poisonous hands. In short, the policy of your warlords to conquer China is consistent, and the speed of implementing their policy is completely calculated based on their own military force and the attitude of Europe and the United States. They have never placed the rights and dignity of this great Chinese nation itself into the calculation. This can be said to be extremely foolish and there is nothing more to add.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nation Fights for True Peace in East Asia</p>
<p>I can tell you clearly that in the past few years, since our Hebei and Chahar provinces have been threatened several times, the Chinese nation has really lost heart with Japan. Our entire army and nation have indeed recognized Japan and recognized ourselves. We all know that unless the whole country unites and struggles to the end, we will really perish as a country and a race. We will not allow ourselves to be slaves of the invaders, and we will not allow the honor and glory of our ancestors to be ruined in our hands, and for our descendants to become a group of poor, foolish, and shameless slaves. At the same time, we have the confidence to know that as long as we unite and struggle, we will be able to shatter the ambitions of the Japanese warlords and finally bring the Japanese nation back to the bright and correct path. We Chinese of this generation are determined to stand up and take responsibility for expelling this great scourge of the East Asian nations, because we deeply know that only the Chinese nation can bear this responsibility. Our ambition is to save China, save East Asia, and save Japan. Japanese people, think about it, you have established your country in East Asia, but you despise the East Asian nations. This has damaged your own foothold first. How can there be good results? The Chinese nation has already made the determination to never yield and never perish. We will make progress every month we fight, and we will make progress every year we fight. To be honest, after two years of war of resistance, China has not only strengthened its spiritual strength and become more unified, but it is also making progress in military affairs every day in practice. Your warlords want to eliminate Chinese military force in order to implement their ambitions to destroy China. They can't do it no matter what. On the contrary, we are confident that we will be able to shatter the delusions of the Japanese warlords and establish true peace among the East Asian nations.</p>
<p>The Actual Commanders of the Japanese Government</p>
<p>Japanese people, evil must be repaid with evil. All your current suffering is the evil repayment of your warlords' policies, and you are only beginning to suffer it now. To what extent you will suffer in the future is really unimaginable. Fundamentally speaking, your warlords want to make the East Asian nations lose their freedom, and the Japanese people have also lost their freedom. You can't take advantage of anything in the world. You invaded and occupied our Northeast and gained advantages, which quickly caused military discipline to decline and evolved into a mosquito bureau of military dictatorship. Your country today is only a group of arrogant and ignorant young military officers who are controlled. The major policies are decided by the military, but in fact they are controlled by a group of young military officers. This group of people is ambitious but has no knowledge, and there are many opinions and factions. Therefore, the result is that those who sing the highest tunes of aggression gain more power. The actions of your country are actually guided by these very few arrogant warlords, who are seizing power and doing all kinds of evil. There is no national system or discipline. The cabinet is just a rubber toy in the hands of these warlords. They can only listen to their manipulations. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident two years ago, after the war started, your newspapers have already proudly admitted that it was a planned action... War is a major event, but your people are only passive, listening to the arrangements of a few warlords, and contributing their property and lives. They also need to sing the praises of the military at all times, and they are only allowed to sing the praises, not to oppose. If they show a little doubt, they will be imprisoned and tortured. In the past two years, haven't the thousands of Japanese intellectuals who have been arrested and imprisoned by military police, and the so-called ideological criminals in our Northeast four provinces, been in the same situation? This kind of situation, to be honest, is not surprising. But look at your original elders and ministers, who have made special contributions to the prosperity of Japan. They stand on the position of planning for the country, but their attitude is only slightly more cautious, and the warlords feel that they are an obstacle and immediately send people to kill them, just like slaughtering dogs and pigs, without any scruples. Moreover, the people who planned and initiated the killings are not subject to legal sanctions at all. The situation of the great figures is still like this, and of course you ordinary people are even more like fish and meat on the chopping board, no different from slaves.</p>
<p>The Japanese Warlords Attempt to Challenge Europe and the United States</p>
<p>The characteristic of your warlords' thinking is that they absolutely do not admit their mistakes. If they are wrong, they hate others, and then they plan to eliminate others. In the past few years, they have not admitted their mistakes in invading China, and they hate China's resistance. Now, after two years of attacking without achieving their goal, they have become angry out of shame and hate the European and American countries. Of course, the ambition of your warlords is not limited to anti-British, but the first step at present is to express anti-British. Because they have calculated it again. Britain has many affairs in Europe, so they will deal with Britain first, and temporarily shelve the United States, which has the Pacific Fleet, as a second step to defeat them separately. They claim that this trick is very clever, but in fact it has long been seen through by the world, and they have forgotten that the countries concerned have common interests and a common position. Japanese people should know that the international policy of your warlords, in a nutshell, is to abandon agreements and break faith. The relations between various countries and China are bound by the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's invasion of China is Japan abandoning agreements and breaking faith. It is natural for major powers such as Britain, the United States, and France not to agree with Japan and to adhere to the position of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Soviet Union is not in the Nine-Power Treaty, but due to the relationship of the League of Nations, its position is completely the same as that of Britain, the United States, and France. These countries respect Chinese sovereignty and do not agree with Japan's aggression. This is only the natural behavior of the international community. However, the Japanese warlords hate all countries and want to eliminate the legal interests of all countries in China under the treaty. This is of course a major provocation to the world. The trend is serious and it is impossible to ask. The Japanese rulers have recently been advocating the "New Order in East Asia." You must understand that the content of the so-called New Order is to conquer the Republic of China and exclude all countries at the same time. Invading China requires war, and expelling other countries also requires force, of course. You can calculate how many strong men and how much military force Japan has? There is a Chinese proverb: "A blind man riding a runaway horse is like going to a deep pool in the middle of the night." You Japanese people willingly follow and allow the blind military to drag the Japanese country to a deep abyss and gallop. Since the September 18th Incident, the real situation in Japan is completely like this, and the root cause of all the endless disasters that the Japanese people are suffering and will suffer is due to the Japanese warlords' thought of despising the East Asian nations. If you don't wake up, you will definitely regret it one day!</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Situation of the Wimbledon Women's Singles Final is Set: Mabel and Stammers Compete for the Championship; American Players Tend to Win All Five Championships <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Wimbledon, 7th) Yesterday, the weather was alternately sunny and rainy, and the wind was also strong, but the tennis competition continued to be held. The women's singles finalists have been revealed, and the veteran French player in the men's doubles has been defeated. Therefore, according to London's prediction, American players will win all kinds of championships in men's and women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles. The details of each situation are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e58">Miss Stammers Defeats Mrs. Van Ryn <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The women's singles quarterfinals have also been held. British lady Stammers defeated Mrs. Van Ryn of the United States with 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 in the quarterfinals yesterday, and won the right to play in the final.</p>
<p>This is the first time for Stammers to enter the Wimbledon final. She is the only British player in the men's and women's singles who is still eligible to compete in recent days. Her successive victories have brought some comfort to the general British audience who were disappointed with Austin.</p>
<p>In the first set, Mrs. Stammers immediately took the lead with two to zero, but Mrs. Van Ryn was also quite calm, launching a continuous offensive to create a tie of five to five, but was eventually won by Mrs. Stammers for two consecutive games, and won the victory in the first set.</p>
<p>In the first set, Mrs. Van Ryn took the lead with a score of four to zero. Mrs. Stammers also quickly pulled back two games, but eventually lost with a score of two to six.</p>
<p>In the third set, Mrs. Stammers played very well. After a tie of three to three, she won three consecutive games and won the final victory.</p>
<p>Due to the rain, the game was stopped three times in the middle. The total game time was one and a half hours.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Mabel Has High Skills and Wields Freely <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>In another women's singles quarterfinal, Mabel (USA) faced Mrs. Sperling (Denmark). Mabel's technique was obviously much higher than her opponent's. In 20 minutes, she won with two light sets of 6-0 and 6-0. Mrs. Sperling's skills were not her match. She rarely won more than two points in any game. According to calculations, Mrs. Sperling lost only nine points in the first set and only five points in the second set. The competition was absolutely one-sided, which is also a rare miracle in the final stage of Wimbledon.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Women's Doubles Enter Quarterfinals <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>In the third week of women's doubles, Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Travis (UK) eliminated Mrs. Hardwick and Mrs. Skynner (UK) with 6-3, 3-6, 8-6. However, in the fourth week, Mrs. Brown's team lost to seeded players Mrs. Nicole and Mrs. Nachar (UK) with two sets of 2-6, so they still failed to enter the semifinals.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nicole and Mrs. Nachar will compete with Mrs. Jack White (USA) and Mrs. York (UK) in the quarterfinals after eliminating Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Travis. The results of the other group's semifinals are still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Mixed Doubles - Unexpected Result <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The last pair to enter the mixed doubles semi-finals was Keulen and Madame Gremis Tustot (Belgian), who defeated the French team of Bauses and Miss Tingluding by a score of 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. This was also an unexpected result.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Men's Doubles Exciting - Famous American Players Victorious <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In the men's doubles quarter-finals, one pair was Corky and Riggs (American) versus Borotra and Brugnon (French). The latter two are renowned veterans in doubles, known for their endurance, earning them the nickname "taffy." However, Corky and Riggs were both finalists in this year's men's singles.

<p>The outcome of the tournament is becoming increasingly clear. The men's singles championship will definitely go to America. Of the two remaining players in the women's singles, one is the British Miss Stanmers and the other is the American Miss Mabel.

<h3 id="e70">China After the War of Resistance <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Soong Ching Ling</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's first two principles were to strive for national independence and the establishment of democracy. His third principle, the Principle of People's Livelihood, was to improve the living conditions of the Chinese people. In our country, an agricultural nation, the land problem is naturally extremely important. Mr. Sun believed that cultivators should own their land. For the stage of industrial development after political unification, he set the policy of national control of resources, railways, and public utilities, and national regulation of private enterprises. However, this was not to suppress, but to encourage private enterprises to develop within certain limits to suit the needs of national economic construction. Although this progress is still insufficient, in today's War of Resistance, we see that Mr. Sun's economic ideals have begun to be realized. Many places have abolished land rent and taxes, and wasteland is being reclaimed. Our wartime construction is being carried out under the promotion of the state and is organized along democratic lines through organizations such as industrial cooperatives. After the War of Resistance, we anticipate that China's economic development will be in a form where all parts of the nation can share in the benefits.</p>
<p>Many people, either out of malice or ignorance, smear the united front of the Chinese nation with vivid red colors. They should clearly understand that precisely because this national united front represents the genuine common effort of all parties, all national minorities, and all classes towards the goal of national liberation, the Three Principles of the People, which was initially recognized as the program of this common action, has become the true foundation of the united front policy. The Three Principles of the People is a program for national independence and democratic revolution. Within the scope of this program, the principle of private property will not be attacked or abolished. The only inevitable thing is the confiscation of the property of traitors and collaborators.</p>
<p>The same is true for foreign capital. China welcomes foreign trade and investment as long as any country is willing to help China's construction. During his leadership of the Kuomintang, Mr. Sun repeatedly stated that China will strive to promote economic relations with all countries willing to interact with China on the basis of equality, non-aggression, and sympathy for China's desire to improve its international standing.</p>
<p>However, we must tell our friends without concealment that the development of the national united front work in the country currently has serious weaknesses. The main reason is that a small number of conservatives still do not deeply understand the ideals of Mr. Sun's three major policies, and either overtly or covertly use various excuses to be unwilling to strengthen national unity. The implementation of the program for resisting Japan and building the nation cannot be consistent in word and deed. Therefore, the political democratization that should accompany the development of the War of Resistance has not only failed to develop in an orderly manner, but in some places and to some extent, the scope of democracy has shrunk instead. This will not only have adverse consequences for mobilizing the entire people to participate in the War of Resistance but will also make it difficult to eliminate the humiliating thoughts of betrayal and surrender by Wang Jingwei. This is a serious phenomenon in our internal affairs. I believe that our comrades who are loyal to Mr. Sun's ideals will certainly make great efforts to overcome these shortcomings. Otherwise, what guarantee is there for the final victory of the War of Resistance? These phenomena of disloyalty to the national united front and restrictions on the development of democratic politics are not only detrimental to the future of China's War of Resistance but also have no future for the protection of the interests of democratic countries in China. Because insufficient internal unity and slow political reform will inevitably gradually weaken the strength of the War of Resistance, leading to futile hopes for peaceful truce and a path to certain failure. At that time, all the interests and rights of democratic countries in China will also be completely swept away by Japan due to the failure of our War of Resistance midway. Therefore, I hope that everyone will pay close attention to the stubborn elements in democratic countries who, using the pretext of worrying about the spread of communism in the Far East, advocate compromise, mediation, or peace negotiations with China. This activity is not only detrimental to our China's determination to resist Japan to the end but is also a foolish act of sacrificing the interests of democratic countries in China. Hasn't Japanese imperialism already ordered Wang Jingwei to publicly advocate peace and oppose communism? Isn't it also simultaneously coercing the Shanghai Public Concession, blockading Tianjin and the Chinese coastal ports, and forcing democratic countries to sacrifice all their rights and interests in China? Isn't it openly carrying out anti-British movements everywhere? The so-called international mediation is only promoting the development of the aggressor's ambitions and is at the same time an unwise move for democratic countries to destroy their own Great Wall in the Far East.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the current national war of resistance in China, from the perspective of safeguarding the interests of the democratic world, is an important part of the worldwide struggle between democratic and anti-democratic countries. This is by no means an idealistic slogan. The most practical people in democratic governments, like the US government, especially the naval authorities in Washington, should clearly understand this. Repelling the Japanese on the Chinese front is also protecting the democratic system in the Americas. As far as I know, in the recent Iirna meeting, American isolationism has expanded from its own country to the entire Western Hemisphere. I insist on relying on the solidarity of the world's democratic forces, and I believe that these friends of yours in the United States will also practice well the traditions of democracy and internationalism promoted by Jefferson and Paine. The July 7th Incident happened precisely between July 4th (American Independence Day) and July 14th (French Revolution Day), simultaneously symbolizing these two revolutions, because the current Chinese national war of resistance, spurred by the events after the July 7th Incident, is fundamentally similar to the French Revolution, which overthrew the old system, and the American Revolution, which liberated the American colonies. Unless one-fifth of humanity, China, can be granted national equality and freedom, China's latent great productive forces will not be liberated, and the whole world will not be able to benefit from it. This illustrates that China's current national revolution is necessary and inevitable.</p>
