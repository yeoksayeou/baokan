<h3>全世界弱小民族的靑年解放運動現況</h3>
<p>— 英·World　Youth　Review·J·Gordon作</p>
<p>（一）日德意侵略者在弱小民族中的欺騙與煽亂</p>
<p>××地的情年在騷動了。××，×××和××羣島的靑年和學生運動，正生撲滅貧窮，無知，及改善未來的民主鬥爭中開展起來。他們和西方民主國的靑年具有相同的意見，參加相同的鬥爭。但是法西斯各國却常用犬儒主義和奸　主義，設去使他們在求自由，求和平反及法西斯的鬥爭中，背　他們的友軍</p>
<p>自×××和××在慕尼黑出賣弱小民族以後，德意法西斯政府對殖民地的要求　大大地加緊了。從說明「人口擴張的需要」的專論文起，到率直的威迫和恫嚇止，他們無不竭盡力之所能，擴展這個運動。但是，他一面繼續着侵掠政策，另一面却仍誘想致殖民地人民的支持。當希特勒要求收囘非洲殖民地的時候，他就裝出阿剌伯人和印度人的保護者的面孔，但同時又以同一口吻，說猶太人，黑人及殖民地的人民都是不及亞里安人的劣第民族。墨紫里尼一面要求突尼斯，另一面以囘敎的保護者自命。日本的軍閥一面屠殺千萬的中國人民，另一面却叫印度，馬來羣島和暹羅安南緬甸的人民，圑結在他們的後面，來反對『西方的白色帝國主義』。連弗朗哥將軍也時時向阿刺伯人自承爲他們的保護者。這種好雄主義的宣傳大多數是對着殖民地的靑年，尤其對着學生而發的。</p>
<p>在阿剌伯的靑年中，法西斯主義者已投下了種種香餌。近來沙拉黑（Baldur　Sohiradh）希特拉靑年團的領袖，曾至近東游歷以和叙利亞及伊拉克的靑年聯絡。在達馬士革的一次歡迎會上，他叫叙利亞的　年在民埃鬥爭中採取國社黨的方法和程序。墨索里尼和希特助每月化數千鎊金錢，收買阿刺伯的報紙，以傳播他們對阿剌伯人民的欺詐的宣傳。他們通過德意的大學，向阿剌伯的學生發中請柬，叫他們到法西斯的國家中去作免費的假期旅行。意大利法西斯靑年大學所出版的幾種報紙，常載對阿剌伯，靑年說話的文章，有幾篇甚至用阿剌伯文字刊出，阿剌伯學生進德意的大學可以特別減費，連弗朗哥將軍也發柬帖，邀請阿刺伯的學生訪問西班牙叛軍。</p>
<p>在印度有許多大學敎授國社黨的宣傳，報紙上常有稱頌德國大學的優點的論文，印度學生到德意的大學去參觀或讀書，也和阿刺伯學生一樣，能得到特種便利和减費，自國社黨吞倂奥國以後，在維也納設立「印度學院」的計劃已於本年年初完成了幾個奬學金慕尼黑德國研究院委員會設置了幾個獎學金，叫德國各大學中的印度學生以論文參加競賽，題目爲；「卍字在亞里安的起源及其在印度和德國的共同用法」。日本的軍閥也通過人亞細亞局，進行相似的宣傳工作，他們的暹羅，安南，緬甸，印度及馬來舉島的靑年及學生聯絡，供獻他們以求學便利，稱頌他們的民埃主義的熱情。及答應竭力援助他們的民族鬥爭。</p>
<p>法西斯主義久已想在殖民地的留學生中獲得勢力。數年以前，印度海外學生會的組織成是受羅馬和柏林的影響的，這會（現已停頓了）　次在羅馬舉行，第二次在柏林舉行，最近，當歐洲阿剌伯留學生主張開會討論阿剌伯各國的共同問題的時候，德國就想竭力吸引他們到柏林開會。日本軍閥，正在用各種手段，在留日的馬來羣島學生中取得勢力。</p>
<p>（二）××地靑年運動現况</p>
<p>但是雖有這緊張的工作和宣傳，雖有數千鎊法西斯的宣傳經費，雖有便宜的遊歷，特種的敎育便利，代表團的派遺，報紙的收買，及緊張的欺詐等等，殖民地的靑年和學生大體上仍能看穿法西斯主義的自私自利的欺騙。</p>
<p>現在且說到××地和屬地的靑年和學生運動。汎阿刺伯靑年大會不久將於達馬士革舉行，這會議要把全體阿刺伯的靑年聯合在撲滅貧窮和無知，並保衞民族文化及民主自由的鬥爭以內。印度的全印學生大會在成立以後的兩年中，已把全國的學生在保衛民族文化及學術自由的基礎上團結起來。他們也已參加爭取××人民的福利和自由的民族運動。在馬來羣島和緬甸，重要的靑年運動也正在生長，這一切靑年運動的意見，自由和民主，種族的平等，誠意的合作，撲滅無知和文盲，反對侵掠並和被侵略國的靑年和人民打成一片——部和法西斯主義所主張的侵掠，種族主義，迫害少數民族這等等相反對。</p>
<p>××地的靑年知道那些法西斯主義得勢的地方的靑年怎樣遭受蹂躪。他們知道滿洲和朝鮮的學生已被褫奪集會結社的自由。他們知道這些地方的民族敎育已經全被毀滅。他們知道利比亞和的黎波里的靑年所遭的迫害，及阿比西亞的靑年所遭的屠殺。因此，他們並不能相信法西斯主義的欺詐的諾言。</p>
<p>在××全國大會的領導之下，全×學生大會不斷指斥法西斯主義的侵掠政策。××的靑年和學生已經發起援助中國和西班牙的廣泛的運動：他們捐募金錢，贊助派遣醫藥隊至中國。學生到鄉間宣傳抵制日貨。在學生的出版物中，他們對西班牙的靑年及國際縱隊的鬥爭表示極大的熟情。</p>
<p>留歐的××學生已經拒絕了柏林和羅馬的勸誘，一九三七年一月所成立的留英××學生聯盟（現已擴大爲　歐××學生聯盟）於一九三八年四月舉行的常會上一致通過决議。</p>
<p>『指斥法西斯侵掠者的行動並促請全世界各國的學生一致團結，以抵抗各法西斯國的更進的侵掠。』</p>
<p>馬來羣島的學生團體也相同地指斥法西斯的侵掠，尤其指斥日本帝國主義在中國的侵掠，一九三八年十二月，他們在阿姆期特丹舉行第三〇屆的年會，在這次約有千人出席的年會上，他們明白斥責法西斯主義，並籲請馬來羣島和荷蘭的人民，在反對東西法西斯的鬥爭中，密切合作，他們也在會議上爲中國募捐，</p>
<p>柏林現在留歐阿剌伯學生大會中獲得勞力的企圖是失敗了。阿刺伯的學生决定在布魯塞爾開會。他們通過了一個議案。</p>
<p>「建議執行委員，和國際學生團體發生聯絡，以便介紹囘敎世界的面員，幷和他們一致爲和平，自由及文化奮鬥。」</p>
<p>埃及的議員兼囘敎靑年會的會長壽得貝博士（Abdul　Hamie　Safd　Bey）近來發衣宣言說：</p>
<p>『在蹂躪的黎波里的阿剌伯人以後。意大利人已决定把息里內伊卡（Cyrenaica）和的黎波里改爲意大利帝國的行省了，　然意首　自命爲囘敎保　者的宣吿在我們的記憶中還很新鮮」。這宣言論說：「埃及人和全世界的囘敎徙應當萬眾一心，來反對這消滅回敎徒以把的，波里轉入意人手中的法西斯的政策。這是我們的神聖的任務。」</p>
<p>代表叙利亞和巴勒士登的靑年出席紐約第二次世界靑年大會的來夫，果立（Raif　Khouri）先生近來發表文章說</p>
<p>「德意法西斯國要　在帝國主義的戰爭中來利用阿剌伯靑年，法西斯主義已經引動了少數的阿剌伯靑年。但大體，　阿剌伯的靑年並不喜歡法西斯主義上他們有憎惡法西斯主義的充分的理由。法西斯主義是他們在的黎波里的同胞的壓迫者。它把猶太人經出合法的家庭以贊助郇山主義，……最後，法西斯主義就是帝國主義。阿剌伯的靑年是恨惡帝國主義的」。</p>
<p>印度，阿刺伯和馬來羣島代表　參加紐約的世界靑年大會，這些國家的學生都參加世界學牛會，這　事實就表示××地靑年和世界靑年合作的志願，××地的靑年正在團結起來，以保護他們的文化。以撲滅無知和貧窮，以爭取自由和民主，他們熱望母國靑年的援助，幷熱望和母國靑年的工作打成一片，因爲××的靑年和母國的靑年都須執行爭取和反對法西斯主義的共同的鬥爭，他們的聯合法就是反西斯主義的勝利的保證。（完）</p>

<h3>菲律濱民眾公意的反映　獨立，民主，和平新政策</h3>
<p>— 續三日本報第二版菲律賓加巴都舍：（G，Capadocfa）作</p>
<p>無論怎樣的環境，國家的軍隊不能用以壓迫工農及要求生活改善而鬥爭的民衆不能阻碍民主自由，更不能干涉勞工的組織及罷工，人民的集會結社等極利，因爲民衆不信任一個用武力壓迫他本身的政府。所以我們的國防軍應該是人民的軍隊，而軍隊的敎育應該是軍人有保衞國家與民主的精神，能切實與民衆合作。菲律濱共產黨認爲好的軍隊應該眞實接近民衆，所以建議以通俗敎育，信仰自由，以及予兵士以政治權利。</p>
<p>菲律濱共產黨反對强迫信仰，如她行於菲基督敎的人民那樣。這種用軍隊强迫信仰，結果只是分裂菲律濱羣島的人民。而使日本或其他侵略者有干涉的機會。我們建議須予以毛洛人以同等權利，予與同等的國會議員，不干涉其思想信仰與文化傳統，同時予與自由與自决的權利，幷予與實際帮助提髙其經濟水平。假若我們不對毛洛人保證消些權利，他們將繼續擾亂，增恨菲律濱人民，而受反動的法西斯煽動脫離我們，因爲反動的去西斯正在用「解放」的口號，加緊向他們宣傳。</p>
<p>五、民主陣線</p>
<p>菲律濱共產黨是要爭取國家獨立及最後建設社會主義社會，我們相信菲律濱人民的問題，若不是在自由與民主的共和國及民主國家最髙形式——社會主義國家要面，　不能完全解决的。請看在社會主義社會的　聯；人民大衆的生活是一天天地在改進，沒有一個失業者，土地與工業是完全在人手中，新的史大林憲法已經公佈，作為土　法人民勞動與休息的基本法律，使蘇聯人民事受了人類未曾有的最充分的民主權利。</p>
<p>我們了解菲律濱尙未發展到可以立刻建設社會主義社會，所以這個目的還未能爲大多數人民贊同，我們也了解就是關於獨立問題也有許多不同的意見，但是同時我們也了解目前主要的問題是改進人民的工作與生活條件，是保衞與發展民主自由。是保衞自治共和國不受戰爭的洗刦。菲律濱共產黨要盡一切力量來完成這些任務，首先　需要使菲律濱人民基於民主與共同的幸福團結起來，因此我們願意與所有的黨派，政治集團，工農及友誼的組織合作。不管我們的最後目的怎樣不同，但是目前共同的任務是建立菲律濱的民主陣線。來改進哦們的生活條件，保衛與擴大我們的民主權利，保衛和平與安全，促進獨立早日實現。假如我們要完成這些任務，就需要大家團結起來。分裂菲律濱人民所需要與願望的團結就是出費民主興國家獨立，就是菲律濱的叛逆。</p>
<p>我們敦請菲律濱人民陣線的各政黨　各組織，國民黨中的進步的與民主的個子，工農組織，靑年及婦女的組織，與我們合作建立菲律濱人民的民主的民族大團結——民主陣綫，我們願與計　總統合作，組織民衆，在民主的大道上來完成民主政治，立法程序。我們誠懇地願意在民族危機前面消除過去一切成見，使菲律濱人民的的主大團結有實現的可能。在民主陣綫的基礎上，我們看出在最近將來，菲律濱人民必能團結一致擁護政府堅决地執行菲律濱人民所希望的　網。</p>
<p>向菲律濱人民的民主陣綫邁這！　護和平與民主反對法西斯與戰爭！雙菲民族爲民主和平與安全親密合作！建立自由　　與民主的菲律濱！</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>記者宣誓運動</h3>
<p>新聞記者不僅是民衆的喉舌與耳目，並且是民衆的教育者與親織者。在外國是如此，在敎育不普遍民衆文化水準較低的中國，尤應如此。在平時是如此，在爲全民族的生存與自由而戰鬥中的中國，尤應如此。</p>
<p>然而我們檢討抗戰二十二個月以來中國新聞記者的工作成績，在國內，在戰區，在×人後方，我們固然已有不少新聞記者，以戰士的姿態，傳達民衆的疾苦與意見，同時努力於組織民衆敎育民衆以外，我們迴顧四週，自己自問，能有幾人，是已眞正無愧於『組織民衆』『敎育民衆』的天職呢？不是尙有少數份子還是漢視中央法令和領袖訓論，而置新聞記者在抗戰建國中的責任於不顧的嗎？不是尙有少數敗類竟然靦顏接受×人漢奸叛徒的律貼，而無恥地在散播『反共，反蔣，議和』等賣國欺民的毒化宣傳嗎？牠們不是還在×人漢奸的金錢接濟之下，肆無忌憚地在執行日×滅亡中國的漢奸間諜及恐怖行爲（如汪派最近在上海祖界之所爲）嗎？我們不能因爲自己本身潔凈而自慰！因爲這些新聞界的叛徒敗類和漢奸之所爲，不僅背叛了中央，背叛了祖國，背叛了全體人民，而且是對我們全體新聞記者人格加以莫大的侮辱！我們今日首先要洗滌這種侮辱，要以肅淸種這新聞界的敗類叛徒和漢奸爲重要工作。</p>
<p>中國靑年記者學會香港分會，爲擁護國民精神總動員綱領及實施辦法，特發起香港新聞記者簽名宣誓運動，徽求本港各報館各通訊社及各地駐港記者參加，贊同此舉的，目前已有一百五十餘人，以後仍將續有參加。該會因决於今日（五月五日）下午四時在孔聖堂舉行宣誓。這是本港新聞記者光榮的創舉，是全體愛國家愛民族有血氣有人榕的新聞記者，對於少數敗類叛徒漢奸記者的精神上的宣戰，行動上的示威。特別是在宣誓中，除了國民公約的全　以外，附加上新聞記奢必應遵行的四項：（一）不登主和派文字，（二）不登漢奸廣告，（三）不售漢奸報紙，（四）不印刷漢奸刊物。這是香港新聞記者第一次以光明磊落的態度，向全體同胞表示擁護中央抗戰國策反對漢好主和運動，這是香港新聞記者第一次以英勇堅决的行動，來提髙記者地位，來提髙輿論權威；這也是香港新聞記者第一次以統一戰線的力量進謀切實執行抗戰建國期內新聞記者之天職的表現。</p>
<p>我們謹以無限的熱誠，贊成，擁護，並且參加這次新聞記者神聖的宣誓運動。然而我們還想對同業和各界同胞略說幾句：</p>
<p>第一，香　記者中之有血氣有人格愛國家愛民衆的，絕對不止今日舉行宣誓的一百五六十人，我們希望大家今天趕快去參加，其有準備未週而不及參加第一次宣誓的，亦望趕快準備舉行第二次的宣誓。香港中國新聞記者公會在記者學會前往商請共同發起時，會覆函稱『對於此事早有决定』，這是再好沒有的，我們期望着一次規模更大參加人員更多的，同樣嚴肅的偉大的熱烈的宣誓典禮，而且必須也將特別適應新聞記者的四項條文附加到公約裏去，尢其是要由記者而擴充爲全體新聞從業人員的宣誓。</p>
<p>第二，宣誓是我們以奮鬥精神和實際工作來擁護中央××建國　策爭取民族解放的開始。我們不僅希望每一個記者在宣誓以後，人人都能嚴以律己，切實執行，並且要隨時隨地，互相檢討，互相勸勉，而且把範圍擴展開去，切實執行新聞記者所負敎育民衆和組織民衆的責任。親在靑年記者學會已有經常的組會和座談會演講會等等，我們希望該會今後加倍努力改進，我們更希望大家隨時踴躍參加。衹有參加集體生活才能增進我們的學識與修養，也衹有參加集體生活才能保障我們實際工作的進展。</p>
<p>第三，我們知道新聞記者和報紙，是敎育民衆組織民衆的力量，但廣大民衆也是教育新聞記者與報紙，推進他的進步和努力工作的力量。因此我們希望各界民衆尤其是社會領袖，一致讚助今日宣誓的新聞記者，時時督促時時勉勵，而對於一切爲×人漢奸服務的報紙，以及那些爲×人漢奸服務的報界敗類，更須加以密切的注視，加以嚴厲的制裁。蔣委員長說『國民精神總動員和國民公約就是抗戰的最大武器，而我們國民月會的組織，就是我們抗戰民衆的精神堡壘』我們要以羣力來鞏固這座堡壘，我們要大家合力來使用這最大武器，來澈底掃蕩×人和漢奸，來爭取抗戰建國的勝利成功。</p>

<h3>模範抗日游擊根據地　晉冀察邊區現狀</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>【民革社五合通訊】一個小小的窰洞裏，一丈來長的坑子上，鋪着五六個人的鋪位，他們住的就是這麼擠。粗黑的氈子上，坐着劉××同志，晉冀察邊區行政委員會委員兼敎育處處長，記者，和伏在氈子上矮棹傍工作着的三位同志。我們都穿着布鞋座到氈子上去。這是北方人的習慣。因此，氈子上濺着一堆堆的泥鏖。我把拜謁劉同志的目的，並提出七個問題請敎他後，他銳利的眼光望望我，微笑着：</p>
<p>「林同志！很感謝你不辭勞苦，到我們這邊來把我們這邊一切的情况，報導給全國的同胞，我七分的願意詳細的告訴你。」</p>
<p>他又笑了一下，給太陽晒得，給風沙吹得粗黑的面孔，配警鏡，粗大的近視眼鏡，十足的顯示出他那出身知識階級的鬥士的姿態。</p>
<p>「我逐一答覆你的問題吧，」他補充了這一句，就開始他的談話：</p>
<p>一，晉冀察邊區的成長過程</p>
<p>「前年，民國二十六年底，留在晉冀察邊區」帶×後方做抗×工作的同志，在與省政府失了聯絡狀態下，深感到恢復政權的必要，乃積極作這種籌備。在短促的時間中籌備便成熱了，于去年元月十五舉行代表大會。大會後電告中央，獲覆准予成立邊區行政委員會，到二月底，便積極開展工作，×人很害怕我們的發展，三月便開始向我們圍攻。但我們英勇的軍民，很快就粉碎了×人的圍攻。到匹月，工作便非常順利的開展了。到十月，又遭到×人的十路圍攻，那時，我們實行空空淸野，從縣城退到鄕村，對×人作反包圍，不打大股的×人，專打×人的給養，迫得他最後只好用飛機除送給餐。這時，我們判斷它必然要潰退了。是時，我們襲擊了×人的司令部，殺死它幾位長官，×人更加恐慌了。不久，便紛紛潰退了。我們把×人截成數段，給它以致命的打擊，殲滅了七千多×人，有一固旅團長。兩個聯隊長，也被我們打死了。×人幹部的損失意外地大。我們的損失，只及×人的五分之一，我們成功地粉碎了×人的十路圍攻。邊區政府更加壯大起來了。現在我們一共管轄七十四個縣，河北五十四，山西十六，察哈爾四。</p>
<p>二，政治</p>
<p>「我們每被×人圍攻一次，愈感到政治上民主的不够。要想徹底的打擊×人，只有徹底的民主才行。我們這兒的政治，就在這種經騐敎訓中，循着這種信念推進的。政治上的組織系統，是村長——區公所——政府——專員公署——邊區政府。邊區政府的組織爲行政委員會，委員九人，爲宋××，胡××，聶××，劉××，孫××，呂××，張×，婁××，李××，宋為主任委員，胡為副主任委員。下設民政處，財政處，實業處，教育處，秘書處。胡兼民政處長，宋財政處長，張兼實業處長，劉翁敎育處長，婁兼秘書長。此外，還有生活技術委員會，工作實騐區，編審委員會，經濟委員會，巡視委員會。村長，區長都是民選，縣長也有些是民選的，更有女村長，女區長。他們和她們都很年靑，熱情，英氣。這是抗戰產生出來的進步現象。也是除了我們第×戰區，在旁的戰區，還很少見的現象。我們最近還打算把所有的縣長都由民選產生。</p>
<p>三，軍事</p>
<p>「我們有××萬的車隊。全部由邊區司令議××同志統率。四個行政專員區有區司令。我們自己有兵工廠，手溜彈及其他各種武器，都可自造。偽軍反正，參加我們的隊伍者尤多。到今天爲止，已快有三萬人了。我們要求偽軍反正的方式是這樣的，先派人向偽軍長官曉以中國人不應屠殺自己同胞的大義，要求他表示態度。如果他表示得好，就直接跟他進行反正工作；如果他表現得不好，就進行瓦解他的部下，使他最後潰滅。</p>
<p>「×人的屠刀把老百姓敎訓得太好了，他們民族的仇恨和個人的仇恨已統一起來，他們都願實參加軍隊，做父母的，也絕不會禁止兒子去當兵，如果長子光榮地殉國了，他們絲毫不悲傷，他們食悲壯地此次子去替哥哥復仇！</p>
<p>「游擊隊破壞鐵路或公路，老百姓必給予最大的帮助。×人像他們修，到傍晚，他們並不囘去，鄕村裏敲起鑼來呌老百姓破壞鐵路或公路去等在那裏的他們，又參加在一挑兒從事破壞工作了。×人體他們看鐵路，看公路，他們帮助游擊隊做破壞工作，破壞後，叫游擊隊把他們反手綁起來，表示失了自由，等會見×人來了，就無可如何。</p>
<p>「我們的可愛的老百姓參加了游擊隊，打進北平的電燈廠，破壞機噐去了。但他們知識水準很低，把手溜彈擲完了，發動機依然完好地屹立着。一個外國技師出來了，驚奇地問他們怎麼不把發動機破壞了？他們說，下次再來，走了。</p>
<p>「有這麼好的老百姓，誰說華北是×人的，誰說中國會亡？</p>
<p>四，民眾運動</p>
<p>「說到老百姓的好，我們不能不說說我們的民運工作。現在的民衆團體，計有工救，農救，婦救，靑救，兒童團和基督敎，佛敎等宗敎團體。這是以職業爲界限的。一切公務員，自由職業者，則參加「抗戰救國聯合會」，這是一個純粹統一戰線的團體，有個人會員與團證會員。各種民衆團體都是由下而上的發動起來，都是獨立的，經費也全由自己籌劃；那些困難的，籌不到的，我們邊區政府也給他們津貼。邊區政府絕小干涉他們的活動。政府只是站在從傍輔導的地位，帮他們解决困難，糾正他們的錯誤而已。政府和民衆團體的聯繫，是經過聯席會議的方式取得的。在不違反抗戰利益的原則下，一切言論出版集會結社信仰是絕對自由的。正因爲我們採取這種非常民主化的政策，民運工作才這樣容易深入的開展起來。老百姓熱情，積極，一點不是偶然的啊？</p>
<p>五，經濟金融</p>
<p>「爲着調整邊區的金融，統一幣制，爲着對付×人打擊法幣及晉鈔的金融進攻，爲着打舉偽鈔，我們成立了邊區銀行。是以法幣和晉鈔作準備金，初時爲五十萬現在可增多了。我們發行了三百萬的鈔票，邊區的發行量，實在可發三千萬，但我們並沒有發這樣多。我們的邊區銀行鈔票，把散在民間的法幣和晋鈔，吸收囘來了。這樣，粉碎了×人吸收和打擊法幣晉鈔的陰謀。×人是以發行偽砂爲打擊法幣晉鈔的手段，但他們的發行量已超過了飽和點，一天一天的跌價了，×人用政治的壓力，强制使用，越是這樣，人民越不信仰，越跌價，于是，在人民的信仰下，在外商一切對外貿易，只用法幣，拒用偽鈔，及其他國際熱烈的支援下，法幣的勢力達到了北平和天津。法幣的地位益爲鞏固了。</p>
<p>六，改善人民生活</p>
<p>「我們對干改善人民生活，不作消極的救濟，努力于積極的救濟。我們開設工廠，布廠，開掘煤礦，金鑛，吸收失業工人農民工作。積極善誘老百姓從事手工業生產。整頓水利，推行生產運動，擴展增加農產物。一般地說：雖在×人的對鎖與進攻下，人民生活都一天比一天的改善了。</p>
<p>七，文化教育</p>
<p>「文化敎育上的基本政策，是一，恢復舊有的學校；二，增開新的學校。現在我們邊區政府管轄下的學校，比戰前增加了十分之一。現在學校，小學七千多所，小學生三十二萬多；中等擊校都是幹部訓練學校；又四個專員區各有一所民族中命中學；軍隊裏有幹部學校；民衆團體全有幹部訓練班；也有一所農業幹部訓練學校；平漢綏東，有一所抗戰學院，內分政軍，民運二系；現在計劃開辦的有蒙藏學院，和在平漢線西籌辦一所抗戰建國學院。總之，我們要以最大的努力去撲滅文盲，使每一個老百姓，不分男女的，都成為知識水準很高的抗戰建國的鬥士！」</p>
<p>談到這裏，劉同志已一口氣的把記者提出的七國問題，非常詳盡的說個明白了。記者感到異常的滿足，乃興辭而出。</p>

<h3>蘇外長突易人　李維諾夫辭職照准　改由莫洛托夫兼任　英法聞訊均極震動</h3>
<p>李維諾夫</p>
<p>【路透社莫斯科三日電】蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫自動呈請辭職、業已獲准、由人民委員會主席莫洛托夫兼任、</p>
<p>【美聯社莫斯科三日電】倫敦外交界及政界人士、聞蘇聯外長李維諾夫辭職，咸極震動、該項消息巳經塔斯社證實、該社稱、李維諾夫「巳自動辭職」、遺缺由人民委員長莫洛托夫繼任、並謂該職更動理由、尚未有說明云、自一九一七年布爾希維克黨人得勢後、李維諾夫卽爲該黨駐英之非正式代表、其生平事蹟中最有興趣者、爲數月之後、渠與英斯科布爾希維克黨人捕獲之英國代表洛克哈特氏交換釋放、返國後即充任外長、在二十年以上、其夫人爲伊維羅氏、原籍英國、</p>
<p>【海通社莫斯科四日電】繼李維諾夫任蘇聯人民外交委員長之莫洛托夫、本名斯洛拉賓、生于一八九〇年、至一九〇六年加入共產黨爲黨員、一九二四年開始政治活動、任共黨政治部委員、一九三〇年繼列科夫任蘇聯人民委會主席、聞莫洛托夫對外交事件並無深認識、</p>
<p>【海通社倫敦四日電】英政界對於李維諾夫辭蘇外長事、謂實予英國以莫大打擊、又新聞紀事報稱、莫洛托夫將組織與英談判、但一般意料、蘇聯目前企圖完全說離歐洲政局、有遵守絕對中立之可能、又聞李維諾夫辭職原因係意見不同、蓋英政府决不允將保證伸至遠東、因恐惹起日本迫得以軍事同盟加入反共國家、</p>
<p>【海通社倫敦三日電】李維諾夫突告辭職之消息，如迅雷傳至此問，英國外交部尤爲震驚、此間消息靈通方面稱、李維諾夫之辭職，實與英國對蘇聯建議之覆文無關、因該項覆文雖已草就、而經星期三之閣議通過、但尚未送達莫斯科也、李維諾夫之辭職、實完全爲莫斯科方面所决定者、因駐倫敦之蘇大使館、事前亦毫未與聞也、當記者最先往蘇大使館採詢時、該館一等秘書曾加以否認、幷稱、如果屬實、則彼丹金將繼任之、及侍其後頗久、蘇大使舘方面始正式證實李維諾夫業已辭職、而繼任者爲莫洛托夫、此間政界及外交界尚未能决定此次蘇聯外交人員更動之理由、認爲莫洛托夫旣未有何政治成績、而對歐局亦乏特別經騐、接近官方人士相信、蘇聯外交政策、或有激烈轉變之可能、</p>
<p>【海通社巴黎三日電】李維諾夫辭職、以莫洛托夫繼任之消息、轉至此間後、法國各友頗爲震動、政界方面認爲、此次調動之理由、兩點頗有可能一爲對李維諾夫之西歐政策不滿、一則因與西歐諸國之談判進行太慢、</p>
<p>【海通社巴黎四日電】據接近法外部人士稱、李維諾夫辭職之原因、現尚未明、又息李維諾夫告退、英蘇談判或因此延阻、又謂新外委莫洛托夫無外交經驗、將來辦事唯有遵從史塔林之命而行、</p>
<p>【海通社華沙四日電】今晨此間報紙評論蘇外委李維諾夫突然辭職事謂、其辭職之理由乃日內瓦政策之完全失敗、又據半官式「波蘭公報」稱李維諾夫之辭職、寔因政界領袖之意見衝突、同時李維諾夫被抨擊、認爲興英國之談判、不能勝任、又聞李維諾夫之宗旨、向爲軍界所不滿、又「波蘭快報」謂、莫洛托夫乃得莫斯科之重界極力推戴、惟莫洛托夫之得任此職、倫敦方面甚覺訝異、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>今日二題</h3>
<p>一，紀念中山先生</p>
<p>今天，五月五日，是中山先生就任非常大總統的十七週年紀念。</p>
<p>十七年前（一九二一年）中山先生在內憂外患交相煎迫中在廣州就任非常大總統的職位，特別值得我們重視的是它重新樹立南方革命政權的基礎，進而有一九二三至二四年的國民黨之澈底改組，進而有偉大的（聯俄，聯共，扶助農工）三大政策的成立，而奠定了一九二五至二七年中國大革命的基礎。</p>
<p>我們今日紀念中山先生就任非常大總統，在革命聖城之廣州已告淪陷而全中華民族解放運動臨於嚴重關頭的今日紀念中山先生就任非常大總統，第一要以中山先生樹立革命政權的精神，一面努力擁護最高領袖，鞏固領導抗日革命的中央政盼，一面努力在戰區，在×人後方，建立民主的革命的政權，同時加緊和爲×人服役的愧儡組織與漢奸政權××××××。第二，要以中山先生斷然改組國民黨的精神。加榮繡淸抗日戰綫上一切動搖份子腐化份子和頑固守舊份子，而大量地吸收對抗戰有决心在羣衆中有威信的靑年進步份子，充實與發展抗日統一戰綫。第三，是發揚光大中山先生聯俄聯共農工的三大政策，鞏固國內的統一，動員全民族的力量，爭取國際更大更多的外援，爭取抗戰建國的順利。</p>
<p>二，努力學習與修養</p>
<p>今天五月五日，又是世界偉人，科學的社會主義的創造者，勤勞大衆革命的導師，被壓迫民族解放運動的熱烈擁護者馬克思誕生一百廿一週年紀念。</p>
<p>中山先生說過，「馬克思所著的書，和發所明的學說，可說是集幾千人類思想的大成。」同時，馬克思早在近百年前，就是中國民族解放運動的最忠誠的朋友，他任其許多著作中歌頌中國民衆的救國運動和解放運動，他一再歌詠並希望一個「自由，平等，博愛的——中華民國」的誕生。</p>
<p>我們在這民族解放運動的新的艱苦階段，不僅每一個不願做奴隸的中國人都應武裝起來參加抗戰建國的事業。而且特別需要武裝我們的思想，學說，並且加緊一切革命的修養。祇有努力學習與致力修養，始能克服新的甚至將是更艱險的困難，而取得最後的勝利，我們要以馬克思的學習精神和馬氏主義的修養，廣泛地展開靑年大衆的自學與羣學運動，同時要在一切實際工作巾增進我們革命的修養。「任重面這遠，任以爲己任」，願我靑年睹君加緊完整理論上的武器，配合戰鬥的實踐，不僅爲了抗戰，也正爲了未來建國的需要。</p>
<h3>敬禮！滬渝新聞界</h3>
<p>上海新聞界在租界當局的勇於屈服之下，又遭遇新的壓迫。華美晨報旣以反對汪派××而一度遭遇停刋的處分，譯報導報更因被逼不許刊載蔣委員長五一訓詞而目動停刊一日，以示抗議。我們對於上海新聞界的英勇維護正義的精神以及國軍撤離上海報界艱苦鬥爭的精神。除了謹致最熱誠最崇高的敬禮以外，並祝其能够獲得光榮的勝利。</p>
<p>重慶新聞界，在前天日機大舉進襲時速遇重大的損書，大公報，新華日報，新蜀報，四川日報等，據傳均遭轟炸。各報過去的奮鬥，永爲國人及國際的重視；近來為擁護中央抗戰建國擁護國共合作統一戰綫及反對汪派「反共和平」的×與論界的頌揚與轉載。現在竟又殲武漢之後慘遭×機摧殘，我們一面對諸同業表示同情與敬禮，對×人漢奸益增慣怒痛恨之情，一面當更認淸解放的大路和鬥爭的决心。</p>
<p>我們於同情敬禮上海重慶兩地的同業以外，要發動友邦新聞界展開正義的援助運動！今日本港肥者宣誓，希望同時注意及之。</p>
<h3>李維諾夫辭職</h3>
<p>蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫，昨日各報突傳已經辭職邀准，遺缺已由人民委員長莫洛托夫兼任。這偭消息，一定爲各方所注目。我們認淸李民過去執行蘇聯中央的和平政策，對於國際和平運動，頗有貢獻，此次辭職，當然與蘇聯外交政策沒有任何轉變的意味，這是一。其次，蘇聯政治機構，異常完密，其政策亦决不因任何人事更動而有所轉變，這是二。</p>
<p>我們所要注意的是最近英國領導的「反侵略陣綫」，對於與蘇聯合作，仍無適要的進展，這在整個形勢上是不應有的現象。但是蘇聯早曾且言，蘇聯已經完成反擊×人從東西兩方同時進攻的一切準備，蘇聯並不需要任何軍事同盟及任何安全保證，我們期望民主和平各國能够認淸此點，增進對英友誼，取得蘇聯助力，特別是要使反侵略戰綫包括遠東在內，才能眞正保障歐洲的以至世界的集體安全。</p>

<h3>一個不平凡的婚禮　單簡而富麗：樹儉婚良模　許世英大使：以二語相贈</h3>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>記者昨天參加了一個很不平凡的婚禮，置身於達官貴人當商巨賈，南北士宦名流敎授文人雅士之林。</p>
<p>那是相當轟動香港上層社會的胡陳聯婚，新郎是大殷富慈善家胡文虎先生的哲嗣，本嗣星　報的少年經理胡好君；新娘是名建築設計技師陳星晃先生的愛女秀容女士，婚禮所在地是巍峨矗立於大坑道的虎豹別墅，</p>
<p>這座宮殿式的建築物，從下午二時起就內進了許多嘉賓，大坑道上車如流水！（幷無馬如龍）</p>
<p>胡文虎先生恭立在大門內，喜悅眉宇地接引到賀來賓，在諸色士女中有好些未參觀過這別墅的，得乘機會由招待員領導遊覽，別墅外的花園石山下，水池旁，都是茶會的所在地，我乘便來一個非正式的檢關，各種各式的人　，在我眼前展　，我發覺這是全國名流的大集會。</p>
<p>三正時，証婚人許世英大使穿着整結西服，襟頭抑往一朶　紅的花朶，出現於樓下禮堂人叢中。原是婚禮開始，儀節是最簡單沒有的，結婚人，證婚人，介紹人，（蔡惠鴻）簽了婚書之後，便告厥功成了。</p>
<p>如果說還有，那便是許大使的祝賀和勉勵的話：他希望新婚夫婦於結合之後，向着立德，立言，立功之途上跑，將所有貢献於祖國，他說賀這一對新人多羅，多壽，多男子將所有貢献於祖國，他說賀這一對斯人多福，多壽多男子。記者想：在窮人祇要福與壽，男子不必多，但在胡實應是共同的願望。</p>
<p>在無數的嘉賓中，我會見了許有名人物，記憶所及的有何香凝，宋子文，杜月笙，王曉賴，余東璇，羅旭和，何　禮：劉慶萱，何艾齡，胡木蘭，……等。</p>
<p>以上是婚禮的輪廓，還有一事記者願略爲叙述：</p>
<p>據胡好先生說，這囘茶會祇費了二百多元，原定三千元之讌會費，乃翁已决定捐賑難民，分配賑聯會一千元，兒實保育會一千元，傷兵醫院一千元，這種有意義儉婚的，是值得效法的。</p>

<p>廣東戰時農業計劃網要　引言</p>
<p>我們爲抵拒暴力、發揚正義、爭取民族之自由平等而抗戰、巳逾二十閱月矣、在「勝利第一」之大前提下、不僅要動員全國之人力財力物力、以與×周旋、　須培植國力、增加生產、以爲長期的支持、而穩操勝利之左券、我國以農立國、戰時　業生產，實爲抗戰經濟之主要基層、自應努力發展、以底于成、吾粵瀕海、糧食生產、尤感不敷，當此軍事局面正在開展之際、尤應統籌兼顧、全盤策算、以配合戰時環境之需要，减輕中央當局之顧盧與負担、自廣州淪×、　區內移、難民救濟、至關重大、倘能於全省農業加以改進，全省　區、加以開墾，則振濟」作、自屬事半功倍、庶不致有頭痛醫頭、脚痛醫　、而問題終難全部的激底解决也，攷　業技術、在平時固須學識與經騐並重、改善與督導　施、而皆一本科學範　、循序漸進、以達到最後之鵠的、在戰時、更應集中富有農業學識經驗而能埋頭苦幹努力邁進之靑年、深入農村、澈底的改善農民生活習慣、提高農民敎育水準、穩定農村經濟金融、同時幷以科學研究所得之成果、爲短期作物之推行、　良種子之傳播、廣植什糧之提倡、旣參酌學理、復切合實際、務期質以改進，　以增加，供求得其平衡、以達到鞏固國民經濟，完成抗戰建國之大業爲目標、孔院長爲推進全國生產事業，加强抗戰力蠶，擬于最近召開全國生產會議、以期將全國生產事業作一總檢討、幷以確立整個發展計劃、作平行的惟勻、爰本斯旨、草擬廣東戰時農業計劃綱要、分述如左、以供采納、戔戔愚見、無多裨補、敬翁海內外賢達、賜予敎正、</p>
<p>（一）改善農業行政　機構</p>
<p>經濟部前鑒于各省行政機構、組織繁雜、系統不一、浪費旣多、功效亦鮮、會督率各省將所有原由農業機關裁併、成立　業改進所、以歸劃一、以收宏效、本省（原有之農林局、組織廳大、費經浩繁，且側重于科　　、　而農于村推行工作、反多忽略、虛糜固鉅、收效未宏、矧在戰時、尤感空虛、中略一）自應將該局改組爲廣東農業改進所、（組織務求簡單、管理務期嚴密、加緊督導及推廣全省農業工作）、（中略）、以應付環境上之急切需求、現符中央推廣農業之至意，幷可援引二十七年五月十八日經濟部公布之補助各省農業改進經費辦法，聲請補助該所經常費之半數，（中略）以利進行、行政機構、現經改善，以臻完密、則一切計劃、自易推行、</p>
<p>（二）積極建立全省　推廣機關</p>
<p>欲增進農業主產、發展農村經濟、改善農民生活、自應于我人農業研究試驗所得之優良結果、傳諸農民、俾資改進，」爲求達到此目的、故有推廣制度之建立、幷由農產促進委員會負責督導全國農業推廣事務之進行、根據全國農業推廣實施計割綱要草案關於全省推廣組織條例、本省應由農業改進所分設農、實　處、農業推廣處、同時並由建設廳會同省黨部以及其他有關農案推廣的機關、設立省　業推廣協進會、共同研肘，集思廣益、以增加工作效能、尤　要者，各縣推廣組織之完成，此爲　個推廣機構之最宅要基層、自應斟酌環境、審愼辦理、查各縣推廣機構之組織、農業促進委員會曾擬有數種不同方式，以便因地制宜、斟削採用，計分（甲）、由省農業推廣主管機關推動設立者、（乙）由縣政府推動設立者、（丙）由農民團　推動設立者，（丁）由中央主管機關直接推動設立者、竊以爲本省旣經成立推廣組織、則由省推廣組織發動、會同各縣、各省有關團　辦理之、幷請中央予以技術上經濟上之援助、</p>
<p>（三）調節各地農產運銷</p>
<p>本省自戰區內移、輸出輸入、皆感困難、而各地之農產、或失諸恐慌、或失諸過剩，皆未得合理之調節、經濟部前以食調劑、最關重要、曾擬具非常時期糧食調節辦法、並經行政院于去年六月公布並通令各省府及農本局調整處、遵照辦理、本省最近如潮汕各縣，會鬧米荒、究其徵結，不止一端、而全省調節機構、未上軌道、實有莫大之影響、本省亟應將運　機構、健全的建立起來、而於市場之管理、交通之調整、在在均須下最大之努力也、</p>
<p>（四）發動全省農村金融動員</p>
<p>我國民向有收藏金融風氣、尤以農民爲甚、農民不惜千辛萬苦、節衣縮食、而爲金銀飾物之積儲、雖至貧乏、亦多不願將其結婚時所置之金銀飾物、任意典當、農民無知、每將此種飾物、埋藏地下、以爲此乃全安全之儲蔽辦法，按一般估計、全國鄕間、至少尚存有、億元以上、本省自應發動全省農村金銀　動員、作大規模的有效宣傳、務使農民明瞭抗戰之意義、了解飾物之用途，以勸導方式極力搜購、卑人僑居海外、爲　甚多，熱忱愛國、素不後人、尤當鼓勵其投資於　村生產事業、幷確立保章條例、以爲取信之明徵至於調整農村金融、自爲先急之務，此則有財政當局之負實、不必冒眛提供意見也、（明日續究</p>

<h3>卓別麟新片　「獨裁者」之劇情　將於九月底正式公映</h3>
<p>正在攝製中的「獨裁者」是目前最受人注意的影片，注意的範園不限於好萊塢，而是世界的，連希特勒也密切的注視着。</p>
<p>「獨裁者」之所以受人注意：一是因爲這是卓別麟繼「摩登時代」以後四年來的第一部影片；二是在這影片裏，卓別麟正式開口；三是在這部影片裏，對于某一個獨裁國家的元首有着極　默尖刻的諷刺。</p>
<p>過去我們僅僅知道的是「獨裁者」的故事將以某一個獨裁者統治下的國家爲背景。卓別麟在本片裏担任着兩個吃重的角色，一是集中營裏的囚犯，一是這個國家的獨裁者。</p>
<p>今年三月初，這部影片正式開拍，有位新聞記者向他採訪　片片的消息以及卓氏本人的意見，當時卓別麟僅說：「暫時我不想告訴你，不過我願意使你知道，在這張影片裏將有一個大場面，需要很多的演員，而我很想儘量的　用猶太人和德國人。」</p>
<p>現在，卓別麟氏又公開發表了「獨裁者」的內容，劇本是居住在洛杉礎的一個英國無名作家所　，定名「獨裁者」，另一個名稱是：「擠滿了沙魚的世界裏的一尾小＃的故事。」至於劇情呢　是叙述一個名叫查理的「笨人」的冒險故事。</p>
<p>故事的大概情形是這樣的：</p>
<p>『一九一二年，「伯達馬尼亞」和「愛理耶一兩個國衆發生戰事，「笨人」查理是「伯達馬尼亞一國軍隊裏的一個小兵，戰事終止，他是同隊唯一的劫後餘生者，當他囘到「伯達馬尼亞」的首都「伯達」時，一切景象都改變了，和戰前大不相同。一天，他正在午睡，忽然給一隊挺進軍所驚醒，他們正在鞭逐民衆去「擁護」『伯達馬尼亞」國的獨裁者希格爾。查理受驚之餘，逃進了一家餐館，餐館老板免費請他吃飯。結果餐館的全部生財傢具全被挺進軍搗毀，查理則給軍隊送進集中營。但有一天他竟逃了出來。從此就交好運。那天獨裁者希　爾在微服出巡，由於兩人的容貌相像，使衛隊們把查理認爲他們的元首，而眞的獨裁者希格爾却反以假冒元首的菲而進入集中營。查理旣交好運，向民衆演說，而他漂亮的演詞又使全國人民皆大歡喜：結局則是：「笨人」查理從睡夢中醒來。發現他仍被拘在集中營裏……。」</p>
<p>我們看了這劇本的內容，已知道這片的諷刺對象是誰。當然，全片的笑料是一定非常豐富的，無怪卓別麟發表了這影片的大略內容後，整個美國的影迷愈加重視「獨裁　」了。一這影片從三月初拍攝，大約在今年九月間就可公映，那時，影迷的高興和那位裁獨者的＃怒一定是可以預料的，我們且等待着吧</p>
<h3>劇運在成都</h3>
<p>去年五月，四川的省會成都。出現了一個「四川旅行劇團」，出發到邊疆各地去演劇或歌詠，在那些地方，有的住民，連中國和日本發生了戰事都不知道，因爲這些地方，平常連無線電廣播和報紙都不能到達的，經過了七個月，到最近才回成都。</p>
<p>這個劇團，包括十三個男團員六個女團員，實行一種集團　作，集團的生活，在七個月中，他們所接觸的民衆，擁有百萬左右，至於團員的生活，非常的刻苦，零用的錢，每人每月祇領到一元。</p>
<p>上演的劇本，包刮「放下你的鞭子」「九一八的犧牲」「保衛　溝橋』「毒藥」等等，而所喊的口號，便是「有力出力，有錢出錢，』「全面抗戰」等。</p>
<p>他們囘到成都之後，就上演「三河」一劇，故事是措寫一個在「滿洲　」的人組織游擊軍，後來又上演「渡過黃河」，像他們同樣的劇團，現在已播滿了全中國，以　術說來，不一定是最高等，但演員誠懇　愛　，使他們在中國的抗戰期內，成爲極重要的人物。</p>
<p>另外，在教　部的名義下，更有一個「旅行歌詠團』，這個團體，領袖和團員之中，有許多是上海國立音樂院畢業的，一共有靑年男女十八人，現在他們在四川各城市旅行歌唱，使人明瞭中國爲何要掙扎，所唱的歌，也有韻律，而含義是求取中國的自由獨立。</p>
<p>巾國各地搬到成都的大學，一般學生也聯合起來，時常表演昔樂戲劇，寡集捐款，貢獻國家，內中由五大學戰時服務團表演的，有一齣戲劇，叫做「再會吧，東京，」是一個日本留學生寫的，擋寫中國學生在日本讀書時所遭遇的種種　迫，而一部分日本的學者，對戰事也表示厭惡。</p>

<h3>丈夫，妻子，朋友　（三）</h3>
<p>進了浴室他還對鏡子唱着。音調更　亮了。乒乓一聲，臉盆架子上的玻璃杯跌了下來。他的歌聲嚇斷了。尖着足囘進臥室。</p>
<p>他正在睡着時，陶麗絲叫道：「你已睡着了嗎？』</p>
<p>「唔。』</p>
<p>隔了一會，他又說：「母親晚上星期許果已經回來。」</p>
<p>里奧拿　了一會不動，隨後他揭了被翻身在床沿坐了起來。陶　絲的背向着他，他在月色中可以看淸楚她。「那却又要開始了　「他輕聲這樣間。唉，許果又囘歐加來了！</p>
<p>她間道：「我不懂你是什麼意思』</p>
<p>「如果我看見許果那東西在屋子裏，我必把他一脚踢出去，你明白嗎？』</p>
<p>「明白的，我愛，」她囘答。</p>
<p>他　又臥下了。許果—那個可惡的歌唱敎師—里奧拿决定許果這時候來必然會發生麻煩。不過他有處置方法的。想　這裏，他睡着了。事情過後再回想，里奧　總不大明白那囘事怎爲發出的。他只知道自己不怎樣了解女人心理。</p>
<p>他把許果，出寓所後，陶　絲還是照常在學習唱歌，一次陶麗絲要在市政廳的音樂會表演，他却同他的同事梅克向所有認識的人强售入座劵，果然票子全都賣光？（未完）</p>

<h3>雙打網球準决赛　何李組光榮勝利　壓倒林珍兄弟奪得决赛權</h3>
<p>全港公開雙打草地網球準决賽、昨天午後由林珍兄弟對何家流及李汝榮、大戰的前夜、任誰都不能預斷何李一對會得勝利的、雖然他倆的靱性戰略、已氣走不少名手、但遇着合作多年又强勁兇悍的林珍兄弟、都以爲他倆凶多吉少、詎事有出人意料的、林珍兄弟的命運、竟與本屆甲組足球勁旅海軍隊的遭遇、不約而同、在此嚴重關頭、竟爲何李一對所敗、至是不特冠軍沒望、卽使亞軍一席、也喪失去了、</p>
<p>昨天何李一對、審悉對方的弱點、避重就輕、採取以柔制勝的戰策、所以兩位好拍手、遇到對方作猛抽的時候、站立底線、穩健地還以軟中帶韌的高球、弄到兩林眼花撩亂、遇有好機會、老李便奔上網前、以柔軟的橫撇或反手的叩壓、使兩林無法應付、老何雖然偎有錯誤、亦沒傷大體、他的正手抽掃、時有準確的落點、大林珍遇着有點麻煩、彷彿大象被小鼠騷擾的難過、同時何李合拍起來的韌性防守法、頑强非常、不怕抽、不怕壓、兩林始終採取軟幹、正中他兩的計、這一點、就使兩林一敗塗地、零此三、直負三盤、</p>
<p>兩林的表演、並非不及平時水準、攔網的好工夫、如常演出、可惜狂風暴雨的扣壓、沒法殺死何李的軟性還擊、劇戰裏、大林珍的氣量、被對方測騐出來、所以何李還擊的組兒、總向大林珍方面送去、使他疲于奔命、在旁的小林珍、愛莫能助、因此大林的正手狂抽、逐漸微弱、在最後一盤的生死關頭中、就無力反襲、小林珍也孤掌難嗚、遂致失敗、何李由是得與徐氏兄弟作决賽、如此佳作、亦足自豪了、</p>
<h3>比賽過程</h3>
<p>第一盤　交鋒後、老何首施下馬威、及得老李從旁合作、乃先取一局、由是戰情漸趨緊張、投桃報李、煞是可觀、相持至五比四時、兩林猶佔先、突見老何網球劈殺、卽以五比五打成平手、跟着又六比六、此時大林珍旗向老李陣地抽擊、老李遂迭爲所破、差幸老何驍勇善戰、遠攻近擊、得心應手、相持至七比七、乃挽囘垂危之局、而其捩轉之機、亦基於此、卒於冉接再厲之下、老何演出獨到、老李亦合作得宜、遂再勝兩局、以九比七先勝首盤、</p>
<p>第二盤　兩林先敗一陣、冀圖收復失地、忽而退後遠撇、忽而上網壓擊、來勢汹汹、何李不得不暫走下風、然而、考何畢竟老練、看出對方的弱點、常向大林珍方面攻擊、加以老李網前扣壓、無往不利、至是形勢又好轉、以三比三打成平手後、復一氣呵成、連取三局、以六比三再勝第二盤、</p>
<p>第三盤　何李乘勝之威、越打越精神、但林珍兄弟到底不弱、尚時思反撰、不過大林珍經兩盤之苦戰、已疲態畢露、何李又不肯放鬆、專與他作對、而使在旁的小林珍、愛莫能助、故戰至四比四時、兩林又露出破綻、縱然努力掙扎、也旋得旋失、遂由五比五而至六比六、戰局緊張萬分，而且兩林此時心裏着念、求勝旣切、反多累事、乃被何李扣壓並施、立脚不穩、大勢遂去、八比六何李完成最後一盤、奪得無限光榮的勝利、成續如下、</p>
<p>何家流　李汝榮</p>
<p>勝</p>
<p>大林珍　小林珍</p>
<p>九比七</p>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>八比六</p>
<h3>南華戰水兵　改期明日舉行</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】自足球季結束後、許多除伍已他旗息鼓、惟南華的球人、因爲準備南祉、仍然活躍於綠茵埸上、</p>

<h3>泳塲巡禮</h3>

<p>當當然作響了、管理員曾伯源說、「本場現雖開放、但到來游泳的士女們、每天尚不多、這當然是天氣還不太熱的原故、</p>
<p>在這新舊職員交替的當中、尚有許多事情擱置待辦、一俟新職員接任後、本場也許會有各項的增設、水上游蔭會、不久便舉行了、」</p>
<p>華人　華人泳場、也于法月開放、塲內佈置、美奐美輪、到了夜間、埸中的電炬、照耀得如同白畫、與綵波相映成趣、</p>
<p>本屈舉出曾河福爲總幹事、辦事異常認眞、對於埸所設施、整齊有序、給每一個到場消遺的人們、廁身其間、如在廣寒宮、尤其是欣賞海風的月夜、端坐在橋頭、體聽着海波節拍的聲調、委實流連忘返、</p>
<p>雙打網球末賽前合照　原真攝</p>
<p>鐘聲　鐘聲泳塲、亦經開放、棚橋建築十分究備、還有橋台上的經欄、在粉飾中、該場雖在西環一個角落、然而每年夏季、到場游泳的人們着實不少、西環一帶居民、取其往返利便、都歡喜到該塲遺與、聽說今年規定、每天晨早八時開放、晚間十一時停止、</p>
<p>中華　中華泳賽、本季也積極改管、現在埸內竹橋、程速修理中、聽說本年加入的會員、却比去歲增加、並經定期本月七日開放、開放時將舉行水上游藝會、及時行樂、這是好所在</p>
<p>其他　還有華員靑年會、永安、大新、銀行等泳場、亦均佈置一新、等待着嗜泳的人們來臨、總之在不久的將來、七姊妹海濱、又成了靑年士女的塵集地、海角濤頭、香衣讚影、別有一番風光、（三木）</p>

<p>意外又下起的濛濛的細雨，細得像秋亳之末，飛到玻璃窗上，將玻璃模糊了。</p>
<p>細雨飛到大地上，細小的水點融和攏來，大地濕了</p>
<p>細雨飛到人底臉上，像鋼針一般，把臉刺得發痛。</p>
<p>細雨又飛到人們身上，鑽進衣服的布隙裏，擰得下水來。</p>
<p>這細雨，一次次地下着，連綿不斷。它究竟是為了什麽啊？</p>
<p>大地上，佈滿了灰塵。垢污，卑鄙和無恥。窒息了人們底呼吸，遮沒，人們底視覺；把淸白底人染上汚穢，把崇高底人壓得卑下。魔鬼乘機大施橫行，世界是在瘋狂起來啦！</p>
<p>人們，在這種情形之下，完全失去了他們底理智：好似受了不可解救的迷藥，辨別不了一切，絲亳沒有一點兒反抗，儘景地俯伏在魔鬼脚下，任憑魔鬼們玩弄，欺侮。</p>
<p>人們所做底事業，因為失去了主人，一齊停頓下來。毀的毀了，汚的汚了，再也不能放出萬丈的光芒，來做人們底助手。整個的社會立刻向後馳轉，永遠不會前進了。</p>
<p>黑暗吞沒沒全世界……</p>
<p>細雨，它看不慣這情形，它不願冉忍耐下去，它要洗刷滌潔全世界，逐走魔鬼，使得灰塵，垢汚，卑鄙和無恥，永久不再生長。它鼓起勇氣，雖然它底力量是那末小。但是它不屈不撓地，一次，二次，三次，飛着，飛着，飛着。</p>
<p>玻璃窗模糊了，它是在使得人們來揩拭，逐走黑暗重新見到光明。</p>
<p>大地濕了，它是使得人們來洗滌滌盪灰塵和垢污，得着淸朗。</p>
<p>人底臉發痛，它是在使得人們警覺，不要再做迷夢，快樸滅外來的打擊囂張。</p>
<p>鑽進衣裳的布領裏，它是在使得們有勇氣，有毅力，來阻止魔鬼的侵蝕，要竭力反抗！</p>
<p>一次次地下着，它是任訓練人們有恒久的精神來奮鬥，不容許在中進報止！</p>
<p>哦，連綿的細雨，是多麽偉大的啊！</p>
<p>我們秉着奮鬥的精神，我們受着細雨的暗示，我們來廓淸我們底社會，施展到整個的地球，光明在前面了！</p>
<p>窗外飛着的濛濛的細雨，是廢除黑暗的明燈！</p>
<h3>謟媚教育的摧毀</h3>
<p>— 左義</p>
<p>學校商店化，知識就是商品，學生就是顧客，巳經是這兒敎育團裏普遍的督象現。非如此，你的學校就無人過問。但是，如何才能達到所招來的顧客盡是闊綽的。如何才能使顧客的人數日益增加，這又成為校長先生們苦心焦慮的一個難題了。這裏，產生了「商戰奇才」。</p>
<p>這兒是滿塞着紳士富豪的地方。一位紳士或富豪他買件貨物的時候，內容的好壤，于他沒關係，昂貴，裝飾華麗，那才是他最稱心的。實質良好而價格低廉反使他們感覺降低了他們底身價的可能，必然遭受到他們的輕視與憎悵。</p>
<p>送子女入學校也不能例外。逢迎着紳士富豪們這意旨，敎育投機主義者把他們壞劣的商品裝上華麗的外殼了。這樣可以把苦心焦慮的難題解决了，多未出色的「商戰奇才！」</p>
<p>一所矗立在山腰的學校，救亡歌曲在那是硝聲匿跡的，爵士音樂代替了它的地位。那位音樂敎師說：在香港救亡歌曲是不適宜的。</p>
<p>這一種學校敎育出來的學生是怎樣的呢？你想從他們之間找出一個模實的勤態的，那幾乎是不可能。他們生活的奢豪，並不遜于他們的家長享樂的熱度，也不亞于他們的父兄，衣裝撲素的敎員，必然會給他們蔑視。卽使最顯淺的問對于他們也是陌生的了，這不但不會是「國家未來的主人翁，」而是「國家未來的有害份子。」他們不能負起了「國家未來的主人翁」的責任，只會消耗了國家的生產。</p>
<p>廣州失陷以來，因為不少前進的學校從內地遷來了。一些還有理智的學生喚醒了，紛紛離開危險的一面而漸漸趨向于前進，一種鬥爭就開始威脅着謟媚主義的敎育，希望這些前進的學校能够在它自身堅固和强大中，這謟媚主義的敎育剷除，由於這種敎育只是通迎紳士富豪們享樂主義者們底意旨的投機，產品。方針是錯誤的，產生的效果是有害的，剷除實有必要。</p>
<h3>慶祝青年節的意義　（續完）</h3>
<p>— 李政耀　謝裕德</p>
<p>（五）工作孤立，沒有與國內國外的學生運動取得聯系。其實，香港學運原與世界學運分離不開的，香港學運只有與世界學運取得密切聯系，然後才有光明的前途。此外如參加工作同學的不適應環境，放棄學校功課，與家庭對立等行動，也是香港學運的缺點。</p>
<p>隨着抗戰形勢的日益緊張，戰區和淪陷區的學校都連接地南遷香港，這樣，香港不特成為我國戰時後方的重要城巿，同時史成為中國學生運動的中心點。因此，我們今後的責任更為重大，我們應該一面迅速克服過去工作上的缺點，一面負起當前緊急的任務。</p>
<p>香港學生運動當前是：</p>
<p>（一）準備戰時工作。國際風雲，日趨險惡，二次世界大戰，大有重演于今日之勢。在戰事還沒有來過的時候，宜提高香港同學們對戰事的認識，鼓勵他們參加各種戰持技術訓練班，如救傷班，防空防毒班等。這樣，卽不幸戰事發生時，留港同學可以協助友邦政府，加强本港防衛，回國者亦有一技之長，得直接參加民族解放戰爭。</p>
<p>（二）加强國際宣傳爭取國際援助，是爭取最後勝利重要條件之一。香港是華洋薈萃之區，它一方面接近祖國，另方面通達海外，加之以這里的同學外國文程度較國內為高。因此，加强國際宣傳，將×人侵略的中國暴行公諸世界。便成為今後香港學生運動最重要任務之一。</p>
<p>（三）切實推行國民精神總動員，最高領袖蔣委員長所倡導之國民精神總動員，為中華民族最具有歷史意義之運動，學生是中華民族解放先鋒隊，無疑的更應以全力推行，一種運動。我們不特應儘全港同學對於「國家至上，民族至上。軍事第一，勝利第一，意志集中力量集中」的意義有深澈的瞭解，同時史應儘他們自動的改正醉生夢死的生活，養成奮發蓬勃的朝氣，打破自私自利的企圖，糾正紛歧錯雜的思想，總之，我們務儘一一方面是嚴肅的工作，一方面是荒淫與無恥」的現象不存於香港學生界中。</p>
<p>（四）廣泛開展各種生活興趣工作，切實推行閱書閱報運動。根据各校同學不同的趣，廣泛開展各科不同的組織，如歌詠班，讀書會，口琴班趣旅行團，攝影硏究班，游泳隊等，務使全港同學，在各科不同的興趣生活中團結起來。同時各科與抗戰建國有關的自然科與新興社會科學，與乎新颕前進的報章雜誌，亦應有計劃的擴大介紹到各校同學底面前去，</p>
<p>此外，如促進中央文化合作，加强募捐運動等也成為今後香港學運的主要任務</p>
<p>親愛的同學們，擺在我們面前的任務是繁重的，讓我們團結起中，集中力量，以完成我們底偉大任務吧！</p>
<h3>流動者</h3>
<p>— 樂書</p>
<p>是一個滿大飛沙的傍晚，到了我們的目的地，江蘇西北塌山縣。</p>
<p>很長的流的一羣，蜿蜒地向前挺進，暮色中流動着幾千顆人影，踏着鬆軟如粉的泥土；一個影子挨着一個影子，連結成一條無窮的鐵的長城，在望不見的一方，隊藏了鐵的尾巴。</p>
<p>為了縮小目標起見，這鐵的洪流，就流向每憫村落裏，散播在能相互呼應的各處。</p>
<p>我是某一部的工作人員，我們共有二十幾人，在離碣山城一里許的一個鄉村中鷄莊，找到了安息的地方。初步的工作，就在整個古老而誠樸的鄕村中開展。</p>
<p>老百姓對於灰色的影子，並不投視驚駭的眼光，却從每個樸實的臉上，流露出興奮的情結；卽使老年人，也會扶着拐杖走來，像對着自巳兒子一樣熱情地慰問。他們所蘊藏的是一顆喜悅的心。這從每個淸晰急促的呼吸中可以意味到。</p>
<p>消息的傳播，在鄕村中相當靈敏，我們到達他們的村上沒有半小時，塲上擁滿了幾十個天眞的孩子，那都是學齡的兒童。每個孩子都昂起着頭，睜着眼，一霎一霎；他們沒有聲響，注意着，傾聽着，我們這一羣每一個陌生的動作，每一句陌生的言語，像在敎室中注意。這裏我們在審視着他們一個可愛的臉龐，在我們的印象裏是如何的深刻呵。</p>
<p>我們開始用國語拉雜地談起來。他們對我們的換了一種語言，似乎覺得有些奇怪，但不費力的聽懂了我們的括，都迅速地把自己的身體隨便的換了一個姿勢。臉部在微弱的星光中，隱約地看出在發紅，眼珠子在閃鑠着晶瑩的光，更聽得分外的興奮；他們爭先囘答我們所發的問題。</p>
<p>沒有陌生，沒有畏縮，我們之間親近得像久別重逢的弟兄。</p>
<p>他們吿訴我們現在還在這裏不到二離里路的鄕村小學中讀書，他們並不因砲聲的威脅而動搖他們的决心，吿訴了我們各人的名字，較大的孩子更說出了這次抗戰的淺明意義，這是從他們曾聽得先生說緝的記憶學找索出來的。</p>
<p>我們於是提出了幾曲一般人都熟了的歌，請他們同我們台唱；他們懂得簡單的輪唱，更憬得看我手的動作，來决定聲昔的高低和快慢</p>
<p>尖銳的歌聲，繞遍了這個冷靜的村落。</p>
<p>小孩子，大孩子，男人，女人流成了廣大的人海，大人們是想來叫孩子吃晚飯的，但給歌聲吸住了，沒有說出他的話，孩子們更忘記了肚子在飢荒。</p>
<p>雄壯的歌聲，傳遍了四野，打入了每個人的心底深處。</p>
<h3>醉</h3>
<p>— 柳依</p>
<p>這好似一個甜密的微笑，滲入了人們的靈魂，遮去了他們的理智，使他們忘却了一切，更忘去了自己！</p>
<p>瘋狂了似地，當人們遇到了那醉人的夢，醉人的酒，醉人的笑，醉人的歌聲，以及一切帶着誠惑的魔力，他們如到了迷國，他們愛着這個醉，這含着毒劑的醉。</p>
<p>可是，人們的心，是那麽地憔悴，經不起半點麻醉力，在他們被陷在這深淵裏的時候，他們還不知己八了醉鄕他們以為還是最淸醒的人。</p>
<p>沉醉着的人們，還不如在夢中，那險岌的惡境，那藏着歹意的吸引力，在他們心目中，以為這是熱情者的施與，最可貴的序幕。</p>
<p>在醉鄉中，一切的煩惱，都被丟棄了，一切的驚險，都被忘懷了，人們被愉快纏繞着！</p>
<p>那酒，那夢，那笑，那歌聲……使人迷戀着它們，使人躱入牠們的旋渦中，那是醉。</p>
<p>醉，誰都見不到他是可怕的，更沒有人肯信他曾給予人們許多不利的襲擊，醉，有着使人意想不到的「陰險」這是醉，世界上最可怕的，最該遠避的！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>「喂，你別生氣，等一等。」</p>
<p>他希望她見識一下，比報紙曾有相反的效果。他怕開門以後她被辱而使自己的秘密敗露；他祇好把她的眼睛引到門的鎖空旁邊，偷偷地觀望。她剛剛一望見的時候，便禁不住地喊了：</p>
<p>「你們這些牲口……不是人，不是人！……你們還有一點兒人形麼……連狗都不如——」</p>
<p>他用手堵住她的嘴，讓她悄悄地繼續觀望。她的話被制止了；但被禁不住的淚，像斷了珠串，一粒一粒地零落下來，如果她不是弱者，她會衝出去，與門外的兩個最不道德的醉漢决鬥，她情願鬥敗，而不寬容，如果她的感情再被刺激下去，他也會以昨夜對付雨文的尖刀；對付他們——即使她知道所得的結果和昨夜一樣，或是更劣，因此，她被拖開了。</p>
<p>那短短的一刻，使她深深地認識了這世界的不公正，人與人之間，還有着主人和奴隸，一邊是高傲的，高傲得忘形，一邊是低賤的；低賤得無形，在這次被綁之前，她曾生長在與這世界幾乎隔絕的家庭，家庭的往事；隨便他怎樣回想，也都是幸福的快樂的記憶。現在，她才開始走進這世界生活，她該感激引她走進這世界的人——雨文，義勇軍。</p>
<p>如果說她對於雨文，義勇軍，有了好感：那好感就是這樣影響的。如果說她對於敵人有了復仇的决心，那决心就是這樣决定的。如果說她對於祖國有了更深的熱望，那熱望就是這樣引起的。如果說她對於父親有了新的那憎惡，就是這樣開始的。如果說她有了更大的不安，那不安就是這樣來的。</p>
<p>的確，她不安了。因為她幼弱的理性，還分晰不了，控制不了由于一剎那所擾起的紛亂的心緒。</p>
<p>他怕她苦於無謂的不安中，他在勸她：</p>
<p>「你該安心！」</p>
<p>「唉，我看見的，沒有一樣可以安心的！」</p>
<p>「你該安心，像在家里一樣。」</p>
<p>「哼，這里，不是我的家。這里，沒有我的母親父親，沒有一個親人！」</p>
<p>「親人未必是愛你的，而我們對你並沒有惡意。難道你不知道你父親是什麼人，我們又是些什麽人？你從前是高中的學生，現在還是一個好的靑年，你該知道這些！我說的不是嗎！」</p>
<p>「我知道我的父親……不管怎樣，他還是我的父親呀！再說，他是很愛我的，我知道。……可是你們不要以為我像我父親一樣！我知道你們是些什麽人：可是你們對我究竟這樣？」　（五七）</p>

<h3>The Current State of the Youth Liberation Movement of Weak and Small Nations Worldwide</h3>
<p>— Written by J. Gordon, English · World Youth Review ·</p>
<p>(I) The Deception and Incitement of Aggressors from Japan, Germany, and Italy among Weak and Small Nations</p>
<p>The youth in ×× are in turmoil. The youth and student movements in ××, ×××, and the ×× Islands are unfolding in a fierce struggle to eradicate poverty and ignorance, and to improve the future of democracy. They share the same views and participate in the same struggles as the youth of Western democracies. However, the fascist countries often use cynicism and treacherous tactics to turn them against their allies in the fight for freedom, peace, and against fascism.</p>
<p>Since ××× and ×× sold out weak and small nations in Munich, the German and Italian fascist governments have greatly intensified their demands for colonies. From specialized treatises explaining the "need for population expansion" to outright coercion and intimidation, they have exhausted every possible effort to expand this movement. However, while continuing their policy of aggression, they still attempt to gain the support of the colonial people. When Hitler demanded the return of African colonies, he pretended to be a protector of Arabs and Indians, but at the same time, in the same breath, he said that Jews, blacks, and colonial people are inferior races to the Aryan race. Mussolini demanded Tunisia on one hand, and on the other hand, styled himself as the protector of Islam. Japanese warlords massacred tens of millions of Chinese people on one hand, but on the other hand, called on the people of India, the Malay Archipelago, Siam, Annam, and Burma to unite behind them to oppose "Western white imperialism." Even General Franco occasionally professed himself to the Arabs as their protector. Most of this braggadocious propaganda is directed at the youth in the colonies, especially students.</p>
<p>Fascists have cast various baits among the Arab youth. Recently, Baldur Sohiradh, the leader of the Hitler Youth, traveled to the Near East to connect with the youth of Syria and Iraq. At a welcome meeting in Damascus, he called on the Syrian youth to adopt the methods and procedures of the National Socialist Party in their struggle for the people. Mussolini and Hitler spend thousands of pounds each month to buy Arab newspapers to spread their fraudulent propaganda to the Arab people. Through German and Italian universities, they send invitations to Arab students, inviting them to free holiday trips to fascist countries. Several newspapers published by the Italian Fascist Youth University often carry articles speaking to the Arab youth, and some are even published in Arabic. Arab students entering German and Italian universities can get special discounts, and even General Franco sends invitations to Arab students to visit the Spanish rebels.</p>
<p>In India, many university professors promote National Socialist propaganda, and newspapers often have essays praising the merits of German universities. Indian students who go to German and Italian universities to visit or study, like Arab students, can get special convenience and discounts. Since the National Socialist Party annexed Austria, the plan to establish an "Indian College" in Vienna was completed at the beginning of this year. The German Institute of Studies in Munich has set up several scholarships, calling on Indian students in German universities to participate in essay competitions with the topic: "The Origin of the Swastika in the Aryan Race and Its Common Usage in India and Germany." Japanese warlords also conduct similar propaganda work through the Asia Bureau. They contact the youth and students of Siam, Annam, Burma, India, and the Malay Archipelago, offer them study conveniences, praise their nationalist enthusiasm, and promise to do their best to assist their national struggles.</p>
<p>Fascism has long wanted to gain power among overseas students in the colonies. Several years ago, the organization of the Indian Overseas Students Association was influenced by Rome and Berlin. This association (which has now stopped) held its first meeting in Rome and its second in Berlin. Recently, when Arab students in Europe advocated holding a meeting to discuss the common problems of Arab countries, Germany tried its best to attract them to a meeting in Berlin. Japanese warlords are using various means to gain power among Malay Archipelago students in Japan.</p>
<p>(II) The Current State of Youth Movements in ××</p>
<p>However, despite this intense work and propaganda, despite thousands of pounds of fascist propaganda funds, despite cheap travel, special educational conveniences, the dispatch of delegations, the buying of newspapers, and intense fraud, the youth and students in the colonies can generally see through the selfish deception of fascism.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the youth and student movements in ×× and its territories. The Pan-Arab Youth Congress will soon be held in Damascus. This conference will unite all Arab youth in the struggle to eradicate poverty and ignorance, and to defend national culture and democratic freedom. The All-India Students' Conference, in the two years since its establishment, has united students across the country on the basis of defending national culture and academic freedom. They have also participated in the national movement to fight for the welfare and freedom of the ×× people. In the Malay Archipelago and Burma, important youth movements are also growing. The opinions of all these youth movements - freedom and democracy, racial equality, sincere cooperation, the eradication of ignorance and illiteracy, opposition to aggression, and solidarity with the youth and people of the invaded countries - are all opposed to the aggression, racism, persecution of minorities, and so on advocated by fascism.</p>
<p>The youth in ×× know how the youth suffer in places where fascism prevails. They know that students in Manchuria and Korea have been deprived of the freedom of assembly and association. They know that the national education in these places has been completely destroyed. They know the persecution suffered by the youth of Libya and Tripoli, and the massacre suffered by the youth of Abyssinia. Therefore, they cannot believe the fraudulent promises of fascism.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the ×× National Congress, the All ×× Students' Congress constantly condemns the aggressive policies of fascism. The youth and students of ×× have launched a broad movement to aid China and Spain: they donate money and sponsor the dispatch of medical teams to China. Students go to the countryside to promote boycotts of Japanese goods. In student publications, they express great warmth for the struggle of the youth of Spain and the International Brigades.</p>
<p>×× students studying in Europe have rejected the inducements of Berlin and Rome. The League of ×× Students in Britain (now expanded into the League of European ×× Students), established in January 1937, unanimously passed a resolution at its annual meeting held in April 1938.</p>
<p>"Denounce the actions of fascist aggressors and urge students from all countries around the world to unite to resist further aggression by fascist countries."</p>
<p>Malay Archipelago student groups similarly condemn fascist aggression, especially the Japanese imperialist aggression in China. In December 1938, they held their 30th annual meeting in Amsterdam. At this meeting, which was attended by about a thousand people, they explicitly condemned fascism and called on the people of the Malay Archipelago and the Netherlands to cooperate closely in the struggle against Eastern and Western fascism. They also raised money for China at the meeting.</p>
<p>Berlin's current attempt to gain power in the Arab Students' Congress in Europe has failed. Arab students decided to meet in Brussels. They passed a motion.</p>
<p>"Suggest that the Executive Committee contact international student organizations in order to introduce the members of the Islamic world and work together with them for peace, freedom, and culture."</p>
<p>Egyptian parliamentarian and President of the Islamic Youth Association Dr. Abdul Hamie Safd Bey recently issued a declaration saying:</p>
<p>"After trampling on the Arabs of Tripoli. The Italians have decided to turn Cyrenaica and Tripoli into provinces of the Italian Empire. The announcement of the Italian leader styling himself as the protector of Islam is still fresh in our memory." This declaration argues: "Egyptians and Muslims around the world should unite to oppose this fascist policy of eliminating Muslims to turn Tripoli into Italian hands. This is our sacred task."</p>
<p>Mr. Raif Khouri, who represented the youth of Syria and Palestine at the Second World Youth Congress in New York, recently published an article saying:</p>
<p>"The German and Italian fascist countries want to use Arab youth in imperialist wars. Fascism has lured a small number of Arab youth. But in general, Arab youth do not like fascism. They have sufficient reason to hate fascism. Fascism is the oppressor of their compatriots in Tripoli. It drives the Jews out of legitimate families to support Zionism… Finally, fascism is imperialism. Arab youth hate imperialism."</p>
<p>The fact that representatives from India, Arabia, and the Malay Archipelago participated in the World Youth Congress in New York, and that students from these countries all participate in the World Student Association, shows the desire of ×× youth to cooperate with world youth. ×× youth are uniting to protect their culture, to eradicate ignorance and poverty, and to fight for freedom and democracy. They eagerly hope for the assistance of the youth of the mother country, and they eagerly hope to work together with the youth of the mother country, because the youth of ×× and the youth of the mother country must carry out the common struggle to fight for and against fascism. Their united law is the guarantee of victory against fascism. (The End)</p>

<h3>Reflection of Public Opinion in the Philippines: A New Policy of Independence, Democracy, and Peace</h3>
<p>— Continued from the second edition of this newspaper: Written by G. Capadocfa (Philippines)</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should the national army be used to suppress workers, farmers, and the people who are struggling to improve their lives. It should not hinder democratic freedom, nor should it interfere with labor organizations and strikes, or the people's rights to assembly and association, because the people do not trust a government that uses force to oppress itself. Therefore, our national defense force should be the people's army, and the education of the army should ensure that soldiers have the spirit to defend the country and democracy and can genuinely cooperate with the people. The Philippine Communist Party believes that a good army should be truly close to the people, so it suggests popular education, freedom of belief, and granting soldiers political rights.</p>
<p>The Philippine Communist Party opposes forced belief, as it is practiced among the Christian people of the Philippines. Such forced belief by the military only divides the people of the Philippine Islands and gives Japan or other aggressors the opportunity to interfere. We suggest that the Moro people be given equal rights, equal parliamentary representation, non-interference in their beliefs and cultural traditions, as well as freedom and the right to self-determination, and practical assistance to raise their economic level. If we do not guarantee these rights to the Moro people, they will continue to disrupt and hate the Philippine people, and be incited by reactionary fascists to secede from us, because reactionary fascists are intensifying their propaganda to them using the slogan of "liberation".</p>
<p>V. Democratic Front</p>
<p>The Philippine Communist Party is fighting for national independence and ultimately building a socialist society. We believe that the problems of the Philippine people cannot be completely solved unless in a free and democratic republic and the highest form of a democratic country - a socialist country. Look at the Soviet Union in a socialist society; the lives of the masses are improving day by day, there are no unemployed people, and land and industry are completely in the hands of the people. The new Stalin Constitution has been promulgated as the basic law governing the people's labor and rest, granting the Soviet people the most comprehensive democratic rights that mankind has never had.</p>
<p>We understand that the Philippines has not yet developed to the point where it can immediately build a socialist society, so this goal has not yet been endorsed by the majority of the people. We also understand that there are many different opinions even on the issue of independence, but at the same time, we also understand that the main problems at present are improving the working and living conditions of the people, defending and developing democratic freedom, and defending the autonomous republic from the ravages of war. The Philippine Communist Party wants to do everything possible to accomplish these tasks, first of all, it is necessary to unite the Philippine people based on democracy and common happiness. Therefore, we are willing to cooperate with all parties, political groups, workers and farmers, and friendly organizations. No matter how different our ultimate goals are, our common task at present is to establish a democratic front in the Philippines to improve our living conditions, defend and expand our democratic rights, defend peace and security, and promote the early realization of independence. If we are to accomplish these tasks, we need to unite. Dividing the Philippine people's need and desire for unity is betraying democracy and national independence in the Philippines.</p>
<p>We urge the political parties and organizations of the Philippine People's Front, the progressive and democratic individuals in the Nationalist Party, workers' and farmers' organizations, and youth and women's organizations to cooperate with us to establish the Philippine People's Democratic National Unity - the Democratic Front. We are willing to cooperate with President Quezon to organize the masses and complete democratic politics and legislative procedures on the road of democracy. We sincerely want to eliminate all past prejudices in the face of national crisis and make the Philippine people's great unity possible. On the basis of the Democratic Front, we foresee that in the near future, the Philippine people will be able to unite to support the government in resolutely implementing the program desired by the Philippine people.</p>
<p>March towards the Democratic Front of the Philippine People! Defend peace and democracy, oppose fascism and war! The Philippine nation will closely cooperate for democracy, peace, and security! Establish a free and democratic Philippines!</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reporter Oath Movement</h3>
<p>Newspaper reporters are not only the voice and eyes of the people, but also the educators and close knitters of the people. This is true in foreign countries, and especially true in China, where education is not widespread and the cultural level of the people is relatively low. This is true in peacetime, and especially true in China, which is fighting for the survival and freedom of the entire nation.</p>
<p>However, when we review the work achievements of Chinese journalists in the twenty-two months since the start of the war of resistance, in the country, in the war zone, and in the enemy's rear, we do have many journalists who, in the guise of warriors, convey the suffering and opinions of the people, and at the same time strive to organize the people and educate the people. However, when we look around and ask ourselves, how many people can truly be worthy of the natural calling of "organizing the people" and "educating the people"? Are there not still a few people who still regard the central government's decrees and the leader's instructions as central, and ignore the responsibility of journalists in the war of resistance and national reconstruction? Are there not still a few scoundrels who brazenly accept the bribes of the enemy, traitors, and rebels, and shamelessly spread poisonous propaganda that betrays the country and deceives the people, such as "anti-communism, anti-Chiang, peace talks"? Are they not still carrying out traitorous espionage and terrorist acts (such as those recently carried out by the Wang clique in the Shanghai concession) to destroy China with the financial support of the enemy and traitors? We cannot be complacent because we ourselves are clean! Because the actions of these traitors, scoundrels, and collaborators in the journalistic community not only betray the central government, betray the motherland, betray all the people, but also greatly insult the personality of all of us journalists! Today, we must first wash away this insult, and we must regard the elimination of these scoundrels, traitors, and collaborators in the journalistic community as an important task.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association has launched a signature oath movement for Hong Kong journalists in order to support the General Mobilization Program for National Spirit and its implementation measures. It seeks the participation of various newspaper offices, news agencies, and reporters stationed in Hong Kong. More than 150 people have already agreed to this move, and more will continue to join in the future. The association decided to hold the oath ceremony at Kong Saint Hall at 4:00 pm today (May 5). This is a glorious initiative by Hong Kong journalists, a spiritual declaration of war and an active demonstration by all patriotic, nationalistic, and honorable journalists against a small number of scoundrels, traitors, and collaborators. In particular, in the oath, in addition to the full text of the National Covenant, four items that journalists must abide by are added: (1) Do not publish articles by the pro-peace faction, (2) Do not publish advertisements for traitors, (3) Do not sell traitor newspapers, (4) Do not print traitor publications. This is the first time that Hong Kong journalists have expressed their support for the central government's policy of resisting Japan and opposing the pro-peace movement of traitors in an open and upright manner. This is the first time that Hong Kong journalists have taken heroic and resolute action to enhance the status of journalists and the authority of public opinion. This is also the first time that Hong Kong journalists have shown the power of a united front to earnestly fulfill the natural calling of journalists during the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>We sincerely support and participate in this sacred oath movement of journalists with infinite enthusiasm. However, we would also like to say a few words to our colleagues and compatriots from all walks of life:</p>
<p>First, there are definitely more than the 150 or 60 people who took the oath today who are patriotic, nationalistic, and love the people among Hong Kong journalists. We hope that everyone will hurry up and participate today. Those who are not fully prepared and cannot participate in the first oath are also expected to prepare quickly for the second oath. The Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association replied that "it has already made a decision on this matter" when the Journalists Association went to discuss co-sponsoring it, which is the best thing. We are looking forward to an even larger and more serious and enthusiastic oath ceremony with more participants. Moreover, the four special articles for journalists must also be added to the covenant, especially the oath should be expanded from journalists to all news practitioners.</p>
<p>Second, the oath is the beginning of our efforts to support the central government's national reconstruction policy and strive for national liberation with a fighting spirit and practical work. We not only hope that every journalist will be strict with themselves and earnestly implement it after taking the oath, but also review each other, encourage each other, and expand the scope to earnestly fulfill the responsibilities of journalists in educating the people and organizing the people at any time and any place. The Youth Journalists Association already has regular group meetings, symposiums, lectures, etc. We hope that the association will redouble its efforts to improve in the future, and we hope that everyone will actively participate at any time. Only by participating in collective life can we improve our knowledge and cultivation, and only by participating in collective life can we guarantee the progress of our actual work.</p>
<p>Third, we know that journalists and newspapers are the power to educate the people and organize the people, but the broad masses of the people are also the power to educate journalists and newspapers, and promote their progress and hard work. Therefore, we hope that people from all walks of life, especially social leaders, will unanimously support the journalists who take the oath today, urge and encourage them from time to time, and pay close attention to and severely punish all newspapers that serve the enemy and traitors, as well as those scoundrels in the journalistic community who serve the enemy and traitors. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "The General Mobilization of National Spirit and the National Covenant are the greatest weapons of the war of resistance, and the organization of our National Monthly Meeting is the spiritual fortress of our people in the war of resistance." We must use the power of the group to consolidate this fortress, and we must work together to use this greatest weapon to completely eliminate the enemy and traitors and strive for the victory and success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Asks Various Countries to Reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Council and Attempts to Falsify the Land Regulations British Spokesperson Refuses with Euphemisms</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Tokyo by Reuters on the 4th] Zetian, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, submitted a suggestion yesterday to the British and American ambassadors, advocating the thorough reorganization of the administrative organization of the Shanghai International Settlement. Zetian strongly criticized the election system of the Municipal Council, believing that it violated democratic principles, saying that all important powers were monopolized by the British side, forming an oligarchy. Zetian also said that the most important "Land Regulations" must be changed to adapt to the new environment, and the Municipal Council must be reorganized to ensure that it can truly represent all relevant countries, especially the representatives of Japan, which must be increased. The ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States have now conveyed Zetian's views to their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from London by the Associated Press on the 4th] After Japan requested the reorganization of the administrative institutions of the Shanghai Concession, a British spokesperson reiterated yesterday that the current administrative institutions are extremely fair. The spokesperson believed that the Japanese investment in Shanghai has increased, but the ratio of five British members and two Japanese members on the Municipal Council is very fair. He also strongly stated that changes to the Land Regulations must be agreed to by the Chinese government, which will definitely not agree. The spokesperson also specifically pointed out that the land tax paid by the British in Shanghai and the rent paid by the Chinese are almost double the amount paid by the Japanese. He also stated that the Shanghai puppet government's simultaneous request to change the land tax cannot affect the legal status of the Land Regulations of the Concession.</p>

<p>Flag Hanging Problem Attitude of the Concession [Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency on the 2nd] A certain official of the Public Concession Municipal Council in Shanghai recently told a reporter from the Zi Lin Western News that the Municipal Council has no right to interfere with the county flag issue, and even if the Concession authorities have the legal power to prohibit flag hanging, they are unwilling to cause terrorist incidents and disrupt the order and security within the Concession. However, the Municipal Council authorities will absolutely not allow the Chinese to hang flags for movements with political implications, so they have decided to contact influential Chinese leaders to advise residents not to hang flags outside the prescribed eighth day.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Far East Issue Conservative Party Members Ask Questions One After Another Expressing Attention to Japan's Anti-British Sentiment</h3>

Foreign Minister Butler immediately replied on behalf of Chamberlain that the matter was as described. However, judging from a similar incident that occurred at approximately the same time, the Japanese side allowed the British to go on that occasion.</p>
<p>Tianjin Concession Conservative Party member Hantier asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain had negotiated with the Japanese side to remove the defensive obstacles around the British Concession in Tianjin, and to what extent had the Prime Minister negotiated to restore order there to peacetime.

<p>[Ming Ge Agency Comprehensive Dispatch] In a small cave dwelling, on a one-丈 long pit, were spread the bedding of five or six people. They lived in such cramped conditions. Comrade Liu ××, member of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee and Director of the Education Department, was sitting on a rough black felt, along with the reporter and three comrades working on a low table beside the felt. We all wore cloth shoes and sat on the felt. This was the custom of northerners. As a result, the felt was splattered with piles of mud. After I explained the purpose of my visit to Comrade Liu and presented seven questions for his instruction, he looked at me with his sharp eyes and smiled:</p>
<p>"Comrade Lin! I am very grateful that you have come to our side, despite the hardship, to report everything here to our compatriots across the country. I am very willing to tell you in detail."</p>
<p>He smiled again, and his face, tanned by the sun and roughened by the wind and sand, combined with his large, thick glasses, fully displayed his fighter's stance, originating from the intellectual class.</p>
<p>"Let me answer your questions one by one," he added, and began his talk:</p>
<p>1. The Growth Process of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region</p>
<p>"The year before last, at the end of 1937, the comrades who remained in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region's rear area to carry out anti-× work, being out of contact with the provincial government, deeply felt the necessity of restoring political power, and actively made preparations for this. The preparations were completed in a short period of time, and a representative assembly was held on January 15 last year. After the assembly, a telegram was sent to the central government, which approved the establishment of the Border Region Administrative Committee. By the end of February, work was actively underway. The × people were very afraid of our development, and in March they began to encircle and attack us. But our heroic soldiers and civilians quickly crushed the × people's encirclement. By April, the work was progressing very smoothly. In October, we were again subjected to a ten-pronged encirclement by the × people. At that time, we implemented a scorched earth policy, withdrawing from the county towns to the villages, and counter-encircling the × people, not attacking large groups of × people, but specifically attacking the × people's supplies, forcing them to use airplanes to deliver meals. At this time, we judged that they would inevitably collapse. At that time, we attacked the × people's headquarters, killing several of their officers. The × people were even more panicked. Soon, they collapsed one after another. We intercepted the × people into several sections, giving them a fatal blow, annihilating more than 7,000 × people. One solid regimental commander and two detachment commanders were also killed by us. The loss of × people's officers was unexpectedly large. Our losses were only one-fifth of the × people's. We successfully crushed the × people's ten-pronged encirclement. The Border Region government became even stronger. Now we govern a total of seventy-four counties, fifty-four in Hebei, sixteen in Shanxi, and four in Chahar.</p>
<p>2. Politics</p>
<p>"Every time we are besieged by the × people, we feel that democracy is not enough in politics. If we want to thoroughly defeat the × people, only thorough democracy will do. The politics here is being advanced in this belief, following these lessons learned from experience. The political organizational system is village chief - district office - government - commissioner's office - border region government. The organization of the border region government is the Administrative Committee, with nine members: Song ××, Hu ××, Nie ××, Liu ××, Sun ××, Lü ××, Zhang ×, Lou ××, Li ××. Song is the Chairman, Hu is the Vice Chairman. Under it are the Civil Affairs Department, Finance Department, Industry Department, Education Department, and Secretariat. Hu concurrently serves as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Song as the Director of the Finance Department, Zhang concurrently serves as the Director of the Industry Department, Liu as the Director of the Education Department, and Lou concurrently serves as the Secretary-General. In addition, there are the Living Technology Committee, the Work Experiment Zone, the Editorial and Review Committee, the Economic Committee, and the Inspection Committee. Village chiefs and district chiefs are all elected by the people, and some county chiefs are also elected by the people. There are even female village chiefs and female district chiefs. They are all very young, enthusiastic, and spirited. This is a progressive phenomenon produced by the War of Resistance. It is also a phenomenon rarely seen in other war zones besides our ×th war zone. We recently also plan to have all county chiefs elected by the people.</p>
<p>3. Military Affairs</p>
<p>"We have ××0,000 troops. All are commanded by Comrade ××, Commander of the Border Region. There are district commanders in the four administrative commissioner districts. We have our own arsenals, where hand grenades and other weapons can be manufactured. Many puppet soldiers have defected and joined our ranks. To date, there are almost 30,000 people. Our requirement for puppet soldiers to defect is this: first, we send people to the puppet army officers to explain the great righteousness that Chinese people should not kill their own compatriots, and ask them to express their attitude. If they express themselves well, we will directly carry out defection work with them; if they do not perform well, we will disintegrate their subordinates and eventually destroy them.</p>
<p>"The × people's butcher knives have taught the common people too well. Their national hatred and personal hatred have been unified. They are all willing to join the army. Parents will never forbid their sons to become soldiers. If the eldest son gloriously sacrifices his life for the country, they are not sad at all. They tragically send the younger son to avenge his brother!</p>
<p>"When the guerrillas destroy railways or highways, the common people will provide the greatest assistance. The × people repair them, and when evening comes, they do not go back. The villagers beat gongs and call on the common people to destroy the railways or highways. Those who are waiting there also join in to do the destruction work together. The × people make them guard the railways and highways, and they help the guerrillas to do the destruction work. After the destruction, they ask the guerrillas to tie their hands behind their backs, indicating that they have lost their freedom, so that when the × people come, they will be helpless.</p>
<p>"Our lovely common people joined the guerrillas and went into the electric lamp factory in Peiping to destroy the machines. But their knowledge level is very low. After they threw all the hand grenades, the engine still stood there intact. A foreign technician came out and asked them in surprise why they didn't destroy the engine? They said, we'll come again next time, and left.</p>
<p>"With such good common people, who says North China belongs to the × people, who says China will perish?</p>
<p>4. People's Movement</p>
<p>"Speaking of the goodness of the common people, we must talk about our people's movement work. The current people's organizations include the Workers' National Salvation Association, the Peasants' National Salvation Association, the Women's National Salvation Association, the Youth National Salvation Association, the Children's Corps, and religious organizations such as Christianity and Buddhism. These are based on occupational boundaries. All civil servants and freelancers participate in the "United Association for National Salvation against the Japanese," which is a purely united front organization with individual members and group members. Various people's organizations are launched from the bottom up and are independent. The funding is also planned by themselves. Those that are difficult and cannot be raised, our border region government also subsidizes them. The border region government never interferes in their activities. The government merely stands in a supporting position, helping them solve difficulties and correcting their mistakes. The connection between the government and the people's organizations is achieved through joint conferences. Under the principle of not violating the interests of the War of Resistance, all speech, publication, assembly, association, and belief are absolutely free. Precisely because we have adopted this very democratic policy, the people's movement work has been able to develop so easily and deeply. Is the enthusiasm and activeness of the common people accidental at all?</p>
<p>5. Economy and Finance</p>
<p>"In order to adjust the finance of the border region, unify the currency system, deal with the financial offensive of the × people to attack the legal tender and the Jin banknote, and combat counterfeit money, we established the Border Region Bank. We used the legal tender and the Jin banknote as reserves, initially 500,000, which can now be increased. We issued 3 million banknotes. The amount of issuance in the border region can actually be 30 million, but we have not issued that much. Our Border Region Bank banknotes have absorbed the legal tender and the Jin banknote scattered among the people. In this way, we shattered the × people's conspiracy to absorb and attack the legal tender and the Jin banknote. The × people used the issuance of counterfeit currency as a means of attacking the legal tender and the Jin banknote, but their issuance has exceeded the saturation point and is depreciating day by day. The × people used political pressure to force its use. The more they do this, the less the people believe in it, and the more it depreciates. Therefore, with the people's faith, and under the enthusiastic support of all foreign businessmen for foreign trade, who only use the legal tender and refuse to use counterfeit money, the power of the legal tender has reached Peiping and Tianjin. The position of the legal tender is becoming more consolidated.</p>
<p>6. Improving the People's Livelihood</p>
<p>"We do not provide passive relief to improve the people's livelihood, but strive for active relief. We opened factories and cloth factories, and exploited coal mines and gold mines, absorbing unemployed workers and farmers to work. We actively persuade the common people to engage in handicraft production. We rectified water conservancy, promoted the production movement, and expanded and increased agricultural products. Generally speaking, even under the × people's blockade and offensive, the people's lives are improving day by day.</p>
<p>7. Culture and Education</p>
<p>"The basic policies on culture and education are: 1. Restore existing schools; 2. Open new schools. Now the number of schools under the jurisdiction of our border region government has increased by one-tenth compared to before the war. There are now more than 7,000 schools and more than 320,000 primary school students; secondary schools are all cadre training schools; and each of the four commissioner districts has a national secondary school; there are cadre schools in the army; all people's organizations have cadre training classes; there is also an agricultural cadre training school; Pinghan Suidong has an Anti-Japanese College, divided into political and military and people's movement departments; currently planned to open are the Mongolian-Tibetan College and the Anti-Japanese National Construction College to be established in the west of the Pinghan Line. In short, we must make the greatest efforts to eliminate illiteracy, so that every common person, regardless of gender, will become a highly knowledgeable fighter for national salvation and construction!"</p>
<p>At this point, Comrade Liu had explained the seven questions raised by the reporter very clearly in one breath. The reporter felt exceptionally satisfied and said goodbye and left.</p>

<h3>Sudden Change of Soviet Foreign Minister – Resignation of Litvinov Approved – Replaced by Molotov Concurrently – Britain and France Greatly Shocked Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>Litvinov</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov voluntarily submitted his resignation, which has been approved, and he will be replaced by People's Committee Chairman Molotov concurrently.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd] Diplomatic and political circles in London are greatly shocked to hear of the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. The news has been confirmed by TASS, which stated that Litvinov "has resigned voluntarily," and the vacancy will be filled by People's Committee Chairman Molotov. The reason for the change has not been explained. Since the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, Litvinov has been the party's unofficial representative in Britain. The most interesting event in his life was a few months later, when he was exchanged for the British representative Lockhart, who was captured by the Bolsheviks, and returned to his country to serve as Foreign Minister for more than 20 years. His wife is Ibero, originally from Britain.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 4th] Molotov, who succeeded Litvinov as Soviet People's Foreign Minister, was originally named Skriabin, born in 1890, and joined the Communist Party as a member in 1906. He began his political activities in 1924 and served as a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau. In 1930, he succeeded Rykov as Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee. It is said that Molotov has no deep understanding of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 4th] British political circles believe that Litvinov's resignation as Soviet Foreign Minister is a great blow to Britain. The News Chronicle reported that Molotov will organize negotiations with Britain, but it is generally expected that the Soviet Union is currently attempting to completely isolate itself from European politics and may adhere to absolute neutrality. It is also said that the reason for Litvinov's resignation was a difference of opinion, as the British government refused to extend the guarantee to the Far East, fearing that it would provoke Japan to join the anti-communist countries with a military alliance.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] The news of Litvinov's sudden resignation came like a thunderbolt to this question, and the British Foreign Office was particularly shocked. Sources here said that Litvinov's resignation had nothing to do with Britain's reply to the Soviet Union's proposal, as the reply had already been drafted and passed by the cabinet on Wednesday, but had not yet been delivered to Moscow. Litvinov's resignation was entirely decided by Moscow, as the Soviet Embassy in London had not been informed of it beforehand. When reporters first went to the Soviet Embassy to inquire, the first secretary of the embassy denied it and said that if it was true, then Danjin would succeed him. After waiting for a long time, the Soviet Embassy officially confirmed that Litvinov had resigned, and that Molotov would succeed him. Political and diplomatic circles here have not yet been able to determine the reason for this change of Soviet diplomatic personnel, believing that Molotov has no political achievements and lacks special experience in European affairs. People close to official circles believe that there may be a drastic change in Soviet foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The news of Litvinov's resignation and Molotov's succession caused quite a shock in France. Political circles believe that there are two possible reasons for this change: one is dissatisfaction with Litvinov's Western European policy, and the other is that negotiations with Western European countries are progressing too slowly.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 4th] According to people close to the French Foreign Ministry, the reason for Litvinov's resignation is still unclear. It is also said that Litvinov's resignation may delay British-Soviet negotiations. It is also said that the new Foreign Minister Molotov has no diplomatic experience and will only follow Stalin's orders in the future.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 4th] Newspapers here this morning commented on the sudden resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, saying that the reason for his resignation was the complete failure of the Geneva policy. According to the semi-official "Polish Gazette," Litvinov's resignation was due to a conflict of opinions among political leaders. At the same time, Litvinov was criticized for being incompetent in negotiating with Britain. It is also said that Litvinov's ideas have always been opposed by the military. The "Polish Express" said that Molotov was strongly supported by Moscow's top circles. However, London was very surprised that Molotov was appointed to this position.</p>
<h3>Germany Retaliates Against Britain – Expels Six British Nationals – Belgium Expels One German Reporter</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Six British nationals in Germany have received instructions from the German government to leave the country immediately. This is a direct retaliation by the German authorities for Britain's expulsion of six German nationals. The British Embassy in Germany has notified them that they must leave Germany on the 24th of this month. The six British nationals are Mr. Green, the chief correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," as well as a businessman, an engineer, a language teacher, and two company managers. It is obvious that if Britain expels German nationals again in the future, the German government will immediately retaliate. German government officials told the British Embassy that Green's expulsion was not due to any criticism of his reporting work or the newspaper's policy, but because the London correspondent of the German National News was expelled by the British authorities, so this was a retaliation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beijing, 3rd] The Belgian government has ordered the expulsion of one German reporter, who is the leader of several German organizations in Belgium.</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Reply to Soviet Proposal – Advocates Signing Non-Aggression Pact – Currently Exchanging Views with France – United States Will Aid Britain and France in Resisting Aggression</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The British government is currently negotiating with the Soviet Union on a joint anti-aggression pact, and is studying a detailed report on the Soviet Union's military strength to prove the strength of the Soviet Union and to silence those who oppose the Soviet Union. It is also trying to persuade countries such as Poland and Romania to recognize the necessity of the Soviet Union's military support in the anti-aggression front. Today, the British Cabinet has decided to submit a reply to Moscow. After France agrees, the Soviet Union can join the non-aggression pact. It is said that the British reply will reserve some military mutual assistance items.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] It is reported that the Cabinet today discussed the situation of the British-Soviet talks, but the British reply to the Soviet proposal has not been sent to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union. It is also reported that Britain and France are currently exchanging views on the negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] Chamberlain replied to Henderson's question in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that the British government is prepared to consider giving Germany mutual guarantees of non-aggression, and denied that Britain has adopted a policy of encircling Germany. He also said that the British guarantee to Poland does not conflict with the naval agreement. Chamberlain's statement is actually a reply to Germany's reason for abolishing the British-German naval agreement. The British Cabinet has decided to submit a counter-proposal to the Soviet Union after France approves its proposal, hoping that the Soviet Union will join the small aggression agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] According to reliable sources, the German Ambassadors to Britain and France, De Niro, will return to office soon, and may depart tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] According to authoritative sources, President Roosevelt's only response to Hitler's speech is to submit a new "cash and carry" neutrality law to Congress. Once war breaks out, this bill will allow the United States to supply Britain and France with munitions, as Britain and France are both rich and can pay in cash. It is said that President Roosevelt has decided not to refute Hitler's remarks any further.</p>
<h3>Constitution Day in Poland Commemorated with Nationwide Marches and Demonstrations; Hitler Awaits Polish Foreign Minister's Response; Reportedly, Britain Will Allow Poland to Negotiate Freely</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Warsaw, May 3] A million Polish soldiers have gathered on the German border, and the entire nation is fervently celebrating Constitution Day with marches and demonstrations, expressing national unity. Demonstrators are shouting, "Long live Poland, Down with the aggressors!" The celebratory mood is especially high in the Polish Corridor, where people are shouting, "We are willing to defend Poland's access to the sea with our blood!"</p>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] German-Polish relations have further deteriorated. Today, German newspapers unanimously issued harsh warnings to Poland, urging them not to reject Hitler's demands.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] Hitler is currently awaiting the response of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to his parliamentary address. The official announcement has been made that Ribbentrop will visit Italy tomorrow. According to some neutral opinions, Ribbentrop's visit to Italy is an emergency one, aimed at explaining Italy's concerns about Germany's policies towards Britain. It is generally believed that the Italian government is quite worried about the increasingly tense German-Polish relations for three reasons: 1. Italy has always been friendly to Poland; 2. If Germany seizes Danzig, its position will become stronger, but this will not benefit Italy at all; 3. Germany's radical actions towards Poland may put Italy at risk of being drawn into a war unrelated to Italy. At the same time, German newspapers continue to coerce Poland. Diplomatic circles believe that Beck's speech tomorrow will still not completely close the door to negotiations with Germany.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, May 4] A decree issued by the Polish President on April 19 was only announced yesterday and took effect simultaneously. Its content is to extend the military service period for officers who are about to retire with a pension or who have requested leave to resign. Currently, telegraph officers are only re-appointed for two years, and the training period is limited to four weeks, but the current period has been increased to ten weeks. In addition, the age limit for adjutants is 50, staff officers 56, and generals 62 before they can retire.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, May 4] Regarding Poland's attitude towards Danzig, there is both anxiety and admiration here. British figures believe that Poland has the ability to decide on matters of interest concerning Danzig and the Corridor. It is generally believed that the Polish Foreign Minister is quite calm. Although his speech on Friday will certainly be resolute, it will still be moderate. All newspapers believe that Poland should make a request to turn Danzig into a Polish protectorate.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, May 3] According to a diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Mail," the British government will allow Poland to negotiate freely with Germany without interfering in decisions concerning Poland's vital interests.</p>
<h3>Four Nordic Countries to Hold Diplomatic Talks to Address the Expansion of German Influence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] Germany has begun to actively expand its influence in Northern Europe, starting today. The German government has also announced that Sweden and Finland have reached an agreement to prepare for the fortification of the Åland Islands (located in the northern Baltic Sea, between Sweden and Finland).</p>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] According to reliable sources, Germany has proposed to Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia the signing of non-aggression treaties. Its obvious purpose is to stabilize the threat from the north, so that it can fully deal with other areas during wartime. According to an official announcement, if Sweden and Finland can strictly maintain neutrality during wartime, Germany will agree to the two countries strengthening the defenses of the Åland Islands. Germany's intention is to prevent the Soviet Union from seizing them as a naval and air base to resist Germany. If Germany completes the non-aggression agreement with the Nordic countries, then Germany can seize them at any time as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Observers believe that Germany's plan to guarantee the security of the small Nordic countries is to allow German fleets to enter and exit the North Sea freely during wartime without being attacked.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, May 3] The foreign ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland may meet here on May 9 to discuss Germany's recent proposal to conclude non-aggression treaties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Oslo, May 3] The Norwegian Foreign Minister stated in a parliamentary debate today that Norway and other Nordic countries are now eager to do their best to maintain their right to neutrality. No one can deny us this right. Although the League of Nations cannot help us, it is still the center of justice and peace, and we cannot withdraw from it. Conservative MP Hambro said that Norway must not enter into guarantee treaties with any group.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Helsinki, May 3] The Finnish Foreign Ministry is now beginning to discuss with Sweden proposals for a joint agreement. An official statement will be issued in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Four Soviet Ships Sail to Singapore</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, May 3] The local "Asahi Shimbun" reported that four Soviet small mine-laying ships left their Black Sea base at the beginning of last month and are heading to Vladivostok. They are expected to arrive in Singapore tomorrow. The ships passed through the Suez Canal on April 11.</p>
<h3>London China Association Holds Annual Banquet; Ambassador Guo Personally Receives Foreign Guests; British Dignitaries Praise Our Country</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, May 3] The China Association's annual banquet was held tonight at the Claridge's Hotel, with more than 200 people attending. Foreign guests included British Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, Lord Gorell, Lord Cecil, Labor MP Snell, Labor MP Swan, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, Sir Milne, Sir Olwen, Mr. Streatfeild, Sir Fraser, Sir Adams, Major General Smallwood, Conservative MP Moreing, Astor, and 50 Chinese dignitaries, including Judge Zheng Tianxi of the Hague Court.</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Chairs and Delivers a Speech. The chairman was Guo Taiqi, Chinese Ambassador to the UK. Mr. Guo raised a glass to toast all the guests and said, "This spring, we have the right to warmly celebrate the heroic resistance of China's front lines and rear areas. The strong unity of our compatriots and the close relationship between China and Britain have been further strengthened by Britain's recent cooperative actions, which will also benefit both China and Britain. I believe that all of you present will welcome the presence of Ambassador Maisky, whose country not only provides us with good neighborly assistance in this difficult war of resistance, but also serves as a pivotal link between Europe and Asia. We should make East Asia think of Europe and Europe think of East Asia at all times." Mr. Guo then greatly praised the actual sympathy and assistance given to China by Britain, listing the British government's statement on January 14, which clarified the British government's position on the Nine-Power Treaty. This move is an important measure for rebuilding international morality. He also mentioned the assistance in stabilizing the Chinese currency fund, the allocation of funds to relieve Chinese refugees through export credits, the donation of books and instruments by British universities to help China establish new universities in the southwest, and organizations engaged in assisting China's work. Mr. Guo continued, "The British nation's sympathy for China's war of resistance deeply moves me." Ambassador Guo extended a welcome to Lord Chatfield, saying, "Lord Chatfield is dedicated to the cooperation of various departments of British national defense, which is truly admirable. Just as China is now working hard for the cooperation of international joint defense, China is both resisting aggression and striving for construction, which has produced good results. China's contribution to preventing broader acts of aggression and preventing the degeneration of the world has been quickly and deeply understood by Western countries. The entire Chinese nation supports the proposition of its leader, Chairman Chiang, that justice will gain more support. China will always receive the assistance of friendly nations."</p>
<p>British Dignitaries Respond on Behalf of the Guests. Lord Chatfield then responded on behalf of the attending guests, stating the reasons for the close relationship between China and Britain, and using British idioms as examples to prove that China's words and deeds are consistent. Britain is also proud of maintaining the consistency of its words and deeds. "The important promises we have recently made, as evidenced by the events and resolutions of the past few days, show that they are truly valuable. What we admire most about your country is its profound culture and wisdom. I am fascinated by the scenic beauty of your country's paintings. I really do not want to see your country being ravaged by war. We know the arrogance of warmongering, but we also believe that we must make all kinds of preparations, not be negligent in the face of danger, and fight against the threats to our people and ideals. We express our deep sympathy for your country's arduous war of resistance. We admire the spirit of the people of your country who abandon their pens for swords and jointly resist foreign aggression. China will surely overcome these difficulties and gain new experiences and courage from the war of resistance. It is hoped that the disputes in the Far East will soon come to an end, and China's sovereignty will be fully restored, and friendly relations will be rebuilt with its neighbors on an equal footing. Finally, I must mention that under the leadership of its great leader, all the weaknesses of China have been eliminated. That leader not only possesses first-class military knowledge, but also has the best qualities of the nation, winning the unanimous admiration of the world. When the war ends in the future, he will be even more loved by the people of the nation and engage in construction. Since the Xi'an Incident, his selfless and compassionate spirit deeply understands that the greatness of China's future revival is based on China's past history and customs. This quality is truly a product of China. China is like an oak tree, deeply rooted. Although it is eroded by frost and snow in the cold winter, it will eventually sprout new branches and leaves. This may be related to the blowing away of Western trends, but its roots are nurtured by its homeland."</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Passes Motion to Present Address to the King, Expressing Loyalty and Concern</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, May 3] Lord Stanhope proposed in the House of Lords yesterday to present an address to the King before the King sets off for Canada and the United States, expressing the House's overall loyalty to the King and its concern for the King and Queen after their departure. The motion was unanimously passed. Lord Stanhope said that this was the first time in the House's history, and that it was also the first time that the King had personally visited a dominion. Lord Snell also supported the motion, saying, "The King and Queen's trip is of great significance. We want them to know that this trip has gained the love and support of their people." Viscount Elibank said that the people of the country all express a very deep sense of friendship to the people of the United States. The Prime Minister said, "The King's trip will make the connections within the Empire even closer, and the relationship between the people of Britain and the United States is particularly intimate due to their common language, ideals, and customs. This visit by the British head of state to the United States will be warmly welcomed by the people there." Labor leader Attlee said that at this moment, anything that can connect with the major Western democracies is worthy of being done.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, May 4] The King expressed his gratitude for the "loyalty" address made by the members of Parliament.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, May 4] The weekly regular mail ship between Hanoi and Saigon has been scheduled to begin on July 1. The parties responsible have already signed the agreement yesterday.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Two Topics Today</h3>
<p>1. Commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen</p>
<p>Today, May 5th, is the 17th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President.</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago (1921), Mr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou amidst the pressing internal and external troubles. What is particularly noteworthy is that it re-established the foundation of the revolutionary regime in the South, leading to the thorough reorganization of the Kuomintang from 1923 to 1924, and then to the establishment of the great Three Great Policies (alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communists, and assistance to farmers and workers), which laid the foundation for the Great Chinese Revolution from 1925 to 1927.</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President, in the situation where the revolutionary holy city of Guangzhou has fallen and the national liberation movement of the entire Chinese nation is facing a serious juncture, we must first uphold the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in establishing a revolutionary regime. On the one hand, we must strive to support the supreme leader and consolidate the Central Government's leadership in the anti-Japanese revolution. On the other hand, we must strive to establish a democratic and revolutionary regime in the war zone and behind the enemy lines, while intensifying the suppression of puppet organizations and traitorous regimes serving the enemy. Second, we must adopt Mr. Sun Yat-sen's decisive spirit of reorganizing the Kuomintang. Eliminate all wavering, corrupt, and stubbornly conservative elements on the anti-Japanese front, and massively absorb young and progressive elements who are determined to resist Japan and have prestige among the masses, enriching and developing the anti-Japanese united front. Third, we must promote and develop Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communists, and assistance to farmers and workers, consolidate domestic unity, mobilize the power of the entire nation, and strive for greater international assistance to ensure the smooth progress of the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>2. Strive for Learning and Self-Cultivation</p>
<p>Today, May 5th, is also the 121st anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx, a world-renowned figure, the creator of scientific socialism, the mentor of the working masses' revolution, and a passionate supporter of the liberation movement of oppressed nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "The books written by Marx and the doctrines he invented can be said to be the culmination of thousands of years of human thought." At the same time, Marx, as early as nearly a hundred years ago, was the most loyal friend of the Chinese national liberation movement. He praised the patriotic and liberation movements of the Chinese people in many of his works, and he repeatedly sang and hoped for the birth of a "free, equal, and fraternal - Republic of China."</p>
<p>In this new and arduous stage of the national liberation movement, not only should every Chinese who does not want to be a slave arm themselves and participate in the cause of resisting Japan and building the nation, but we also especially need to arm our thoughts, doctrines, and intensify all revolutionary self-cultivation. Only by striving for learning and committing to self-cultivation can we overcome new, and perhaps even more difficult, obstacles and achieve final victory. We must use Marx's spirit of learning and the self-cultivation of Marxism to broadly launch the self-study and group study movement of the young masses, and at the same time increase our revolutionary self-cultivation in all practical work. "The task is heavy and the road is long, take it as your own responsibility." May my youth strengthen their theoretical weapons and coordinate with the practice of combat, not only for the war of resistance, but also for the needs of future nation-building.</p>
<h3>Respect to the Shanghai and Chongqing Press Circles!</h3>
<p>Under the courageous submission of the Shanghai press circles to the authorities in the concessions, they have encountered new oppression. The "China Morning Post" has been punished with a temporary suspension for opposing the Wang Jingwei faction, and the "Translation and Reporting News" was forced to suspend publication for one day as a protest because it was forbidden to publish Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's May 1st instructions. We extend our most sincere and highest respect to the Shanghai press circles for their heroic maintenance of justice and the spirit of the press circles who bravely struggled after the withdrawal of the National Army from Shanghai, and wish them to achieve a glorious victory.</p>
<p>The Chongqing press circles suffered significant losses during the large-scale attack by Japanese aircraft the day before yesterday. It is said that the "Ta Kung Pao," "Xinhua Daily," "New Sichuan Daily," and "Sichuan Daily" were all bombed. The past struggles of various newspapers have always been valued by the Chinese people and the international community. Recently, they have been praised and reprinted by the opinion circles for supporting the central government's war of resistance and national reconstruction, supporting the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the united front, and opposing the Wang Jingwei faction's "anti-communism and peace". Now, after Wuhan, they have tragically suffered damage from enemy aircraft again. We express our sympathy and respect to our colleagues, and increase our anger and hatred towards the enemy and traitors. We must further clarify the road to liberation and the determination to fight.</p>
<p>In addition to sympathizing with and respecting our colleagues in Shanghai and Chongqing, we must launch a righteous assistance movement in the press circles of friendly countries! Today, the reporters in this port swore an oath, and hope that attention will be paid to it at the same time.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Resigns</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all newspapers suddenly reported that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov had resigned and his resignation had been approved. The vacancy has been concurrently filled by People's Commissar Molotov. This news will surely attract attention from all parties. We believe that Litvinov has contributed to the international peace movement in the past by implementing the Soviet central government's peace policy. This resignation, of course, does not imply any change in Soviet foreign policy, this is one. Secondly, the Soviet political structure is extremely complete, and its policies will never change due to any personnel changes, this is two.</p>
<p>What we need to pay attention to is that the "anti-aggression front" led by Britain has not made adequate progress in cooperating with the Soviet Union, which is not appropriate in the overall situation. However, the Soviet Union has long stated that it has completed all preparations to counter enemy attacks from both the east and west. The Soviet Union does not need any military alliances or any security guarantees. We hope that democratic and peaceful countries can recognize this point, enhance friendship with Britain, and obtain Soviet assistance. In particular, the anti-aggression front must include the Far East to truly guarantee European and even world collective security.</p>

<h3>The Tranquility of a Million Residents is at Stake; the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance Expires at the End of the Month; the Hong Kong Government is Considering Whether to Extend It; If Extended, Legislation May Need to Be Re-Enacted</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is a small island with a dense population. The supply of housing has always been barely sufficient. After the Sino-Japanese War, the population suddenly increased by hundreds of thousands, and the shortage of buildings has become an inevitable result. Therefore, unscrupulous landlords took the opportunity to increase rents, seeking huge profits from refugees and making a fortune from the national crisis, causing social unrest. In June of last year, the Hong Kong authorities promulgated the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, and residents were able to live in relative peace. However, the validity period of this ordinance is one year, and it will expire at the end of this month. It is particularly noteworthy whether the Hong Kong government will be able to continue to extend its validity in the future. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Lo Man-kam, the Chinese representative, to inquire about everything. According to him, "Regarding the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, I learned this morning (yesterday) after reading the Western newspapers whether the Legislative Council will discuss it next week. I have not yet received a report, and the authorities have not officially expressed their opinions. However, as far as I know, the Hong Kong government has been studying the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance for a month and will re-enact new legislation or continue the old one, which depends on the results of the research. On the government's side, the first principle is to obtain fair legislation to seek social security. The current protection regulations are not biased, but if new regulations can be updated and are more perfect than the current ones, I have no comments until the results of the research on the new regulations have been obtained. However, there is still one point that all sectors of society cannot ignore. When all parties receive news, there are tenants who increase rents to sub-tenants before the landlord has increased rents, and many of them have made huge profits. Therefore, the rental value of each bed in middle and lower-level houses has increased to more than five yuan. These people are even more vicious than landlords," etc. According to the reporter from the Daily Telegraph yesterday, who interviewed the Colonial Secretary Smith regarding the question of whether to continue the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, he replied that the matter was under study and had not reached a decision stage. The reporter also interviewed a senior official, who replied that if it is necessary to continue the ordinance, the government may enact new regulations. This matter will be included in the agenda of the Legislative Council meeting next week.</p>

<h3>The Hongliu Anti-Japanese War Theatre Troupe Is Out of Food in Enping; Appeals to All Sectors in Hong Kong for Assistance</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Ninglin, a well-known figure in the drama circles, has led the Hongliu Anti-Japanese War Theatre Troupe since its establishment in Guangzhou last year during the September 18th Incident. It immediately set out to the mainland to devote itself to the cause of national salvation. In the half-year since, it has passed through more than ten counties and deeply gained the sympathy of the mainland people. It has now moved to Enping, where its work is extremely diligent. However, the troupe has no fixed funding or subsidies, and all expenses are mostly borne by the troupe members themselves. They are now in dire straits and have been without food for two days. It is quite difficult to collect money by performing plays in the mainland, so Mr. Huang has been busy appealing to celebrities in Hong Kong, hoping that all sectors will provide assistance so that the troupe can continue to extend its spiritual mobilization and national salvation work.</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Kerr's Rumored Suspension of Flight to Chongqing; Chinese Affairs Secretary Denies Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent incidents of frequent harassment in the sky by enemy aircraft, the Hong Kong Telegraph reported the night before last that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, initially planned to fly to Chongqing on a Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane. However, for safety reasons, he suddenly returned his ticket. This shows how much attention the enemy authorities are paying to the whereabouts of the personnel of the British Embassy in China, etc. Yesterday, many Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong translated this report. The Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Callard, therefore met with reporters yesterday afternoon to make a responsible statement, saying that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr did not suspend his flight to Chongqing on a Eurasia plane. The claim that the enemy authorities were paying attention to the whereabouts of the personnel of the British Embassy in China is even more unfounded.</p>

<h3>Japanese Textiles Are Dumped in Hong Kong; This Spring's Sales Are Even More Alarming; Sales Have Reached 3 Million, Inventory Is 2 Million; British and American Textile Merchants Are Vigilant Against Japanese Goods Falsifying</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong textile market has traditionally featured products from Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other countries competing in Hong Kong, all with considerable sales volume. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the mentality of the citizens has changed, and the purchase of Japanese goods has decreased daily. Goods from Britain, the United States, and France have taken the opportunity to rise. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of spring, the situation has changed greatly. The inherent market of goods from Britain, the United States, and France has been encroached upon by Japan, and Germany is at the end of its rope. According to a certain magnate in the textile industry speaking to reporters, in the spring of this year, textiles from Britain, the United States, and France totaled less than 2 million yuan, a fold decrease compared to last year, while Japanese goods dumping reached more than 3 million yuan. The current inventory in warehouses is also worth 2 million yuan. It has been found that there are more than 40 textile merchants who have joined the Textile Association. They have taken a united step and stipulated that the business policy should be to specialize in selling goods from Britain, the United States, France, and domestic products, and issue certificates, but there are still many who have not followed suit. There are even more who have not joined the association, reaching more than 80. They take free action, and even under severe criticism from society, they can do nothing about it. Currently, manufacturers of goods from Britain, the United States, and France, in order to prevent counterfeiting and restore the market, have started recently to print the origin and manufacturer of a certain country on the selvage of every piece of cloth every one and a half yards. At the same time, the foreign firm managed dispatches secret internal staff to investigate the market. Once counterfeiting is discovered, they will be prosecuted.</p>

<h3>An Extraordinary Wedding: Simple but Splendid: Shu Jian Marries a Good Model; Ambassador Xu Shiying: Presents Two Words</h3>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter attended a very extraordinary wedding, placing himself among high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants, prominent figures from the North and South, professors, writers, and artists.</p>
<p>It was the highly sensational Hu-Chen marriage in Hong Kong's upper class. The groom is the son of the great philanthropist and wealthy businessman Mr. Hu Wenhu, the young manager of this newspaper, Hu Haojun; the bride is Ms. Xiu Rong, the beloved daughter of the famous architectural designer Mr. Chen Xinghuang. The wedding location was the magnificent Tiger Balm Garden, towering on Tai Hang Road.</p>
<p>This palatial building had been filled with many guests from 2:00 PM onwards, and cars flowed like water on Tai Hang Road! (No horses like dragons).</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu stood respectfully inside the gate, greeting the arriving guests with a joyful expression. Among the various ladies and gentlemen, there were quite a few who had not visited this villa before, and they took the opportunity to tour under the guidance of the staff. The gardens outside the villa, under the rockeries, and by the pools were all locations for the tea party. I took the opportunity to conduct an informal observation, and various types of people were on display before my eyes. I discovered that this was a grand gathering of national celebrities.</p>
<p>At three o'clock sharp, the wedding officiant, Ambassador Xu Shiying, appeared among the crowd in the downstairs hall, wearing a neatly tailored Western suit with a bright red flower pinned to his chest. The wedding ceremony began, and the procedures were the simplest possible. After the wedding party, the officiant, and the introducer (Cai Huihong) signed the marriage certificate, the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>If there was anything else, it was Ambassador Xu's congratulatory and encouraging remarks: He hoped that after the married couple were united, they would strive towards establishing virtue, words, and deeds, and contribute all they had to the motherland. He said that he wished this new couple much happiness, longevity, and many sons, and that all they had to contribute to the motherland. The reporter thought: Poor people only need happiness and longevity, and do not necessarily need many sons, but in Hu's case, it should be a common wish.</p>
<p>Among the countless guests, I met many famous people. To the best of my memory, there were He Xiangning, Song Ziwen, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Dongxuan, Luo Xuhhe, He Li, Liu Qingxuan, He Ailing, Hu Mulan, and others.</p>
<p>The above is the outline of the wedding. There is one more thing the reporter would like to briefly describe:</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu Hao, this tea party only cost more than 200 yuan. The originally planned banquet fee of 3,000 yuan has been decided by his father to be donated to disaster relief for refugees, with 1,000 yuan allocated to the Relief Federation, 1,000 yuan to the Children's Welfare Association, and 1,000 yuan to the wounded soldiers' hospital. This kind of meaningful and frugal wedding is worth emulating.</p>

<h3>Political Department of the Fourth War Zone; Countermeasures to Deal with the Enemy's Appeasement Conspiracy; Orders Military and Political Authorities in Various Places to Regulate Supplies to Reduce the Burden on the People; Intensify Propaganda Efforts and Promote Covenants to Politically Strike the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Qujiang Express News] The Political Department of the Fourth War Zone, based on reports that the enemy is using political tactics to win over the people's hearts, deliberately selling goods cheaply and providing money, has found that there are many ignorant villagers in various places who go to the enemy for transactions. These ignorant villagers are mostly forced by their livelihood. Recently, transportation in various places has been inconvenient, and the distribution of supplies has been uneven, resulting in a lack of daily necessities. Even if there are some, the supply does not meet the demand, and the prices are expensive. Villagers are forced by their livelihood to take risks, which is a great obstacle to the future of the war of resistance. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, specific countermeasures have been formulated and ordered to be implemented: (1) Military and political authorities in various places should find ways to regulate supplies and assess prices to ensure that supply meets demand and the burden on the people is reduced; (2) Intensify propaganda efforts to expose the enemy's conspiracy, and urge the people to earnestly fulfill the Anti-Japanese War Covenant; (3) Implement a blockade policy against the enemy area, and strictly inspect import and export trade and goods. If they are enemy goods, they will be detained and handed over to the local Anti-Japanese War Support Association for disposal, but they must not be disturbed under any pretext; (4) For private traffickers and merchants who sell enemy goods, once discovered, they should be severely punished according to the circumstances. After receiving the order, the department (1) Regarding the assessment of prices, the local defense army county government party headquarters and people's anti-Japanese support association, etc., should convene a price assessment conference based on the actual situation; (2) Regarding the detailed measures for urging the people to fulfill the Anti-Japanese War Covenant, further orders will be issued; (3) Regarding the blockade of the enemy area and the punishment of private traffickers and merchants transporting enemy goods, it should be earnestly promoted.</p>

<h3>Forced Ferry; Traveling on the Jiangmen-Guangzhou Line; Confiscate Boats and Operate During the Day</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express News] The enemy in Jiangmen has been actively intensifying the construction of defensive fortifications in recent days to prevent our counterattacks.

At the same time, they are forcing our ferries to resume the Jiangmen-Guangzhou route, confiscating boats in the Beijie area of Jiangmen, and preparing to start operating during the day in order to fulfill their dream of "prospering Guangzhou." However, our guerrillas are active near Jiangmen, which is causing the enemy great anxiety.</p>

The authorities have learned that this is the work of Han traitors, attempting to disrupt the security of the rear and seize the opportunity to act. Orders have been issued to strictly investigate and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Tense War Situation; Refugees Are Exempted from Poll Tax When Entering Vietnam; The Governor-General of Vietnam Stipulates Four Measures; Notifies Border Counties to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Fangcheng Express News] Since the enemy's invasion of Vietnam, there has recently been a large-scale conspiracy to land in Qinlian and attack Guilin. The Vietnamese authorities, in order to unite with friendly countries, have specially stipulated four rules for accommodating refugees after the fall of neighboring counties and cities bordering Vietnam: (1) When neighboring border areas fall, refugees in various places may temporarily be exempted from paying poll tax and move to live within the Vietnamese border. The time limit is set at three months. After the deadline, they will pay poll tax in accordance with the usual entry procedures. However, within the deadline, refugees must find a local gang leader to guarantee them, submit a report to the local government, and request issuance, otherwise they will be charged with fraud and severely punished if found out in the future; (2) Refugees from the occupied war zones who wish to settle in Vietnam, in addition to those who are able to support themselves, will be housed by the local government in designated locations; (3) If counties, townships, and towns in neighboring border areas encounter air raids, flexible measures may be taken to allow them to enter the country temporarily to take refuge, but the defense areas are still limited to those designated by the local government; (4) After the air raid alarm is lifted, they must immediately evacuate the air defense locations. The Vietnamese Governor-General has ordered the commander of the First Military District of Mang Street to be notified of the above four refugee accommodation measures, and also to notify the Fangcheng County Government and the Dongxing Police Station to investigate.</p>
<h3>Wartime Food Management Committee; Circulates Rice in Various Places; Strictly Prevents Dishonest Manipulation</h3>
<p>[Qujiang Express News] The Guangdong Wartime Food Management Committee believes that the rice in various counties has not been interconnected in the past, resulting in high rice prices and suffering for the poor. Moreover, due to procurement difficulties, the food supply for the military and civilians is sometimes insufficient. It is urgent to find ways to circulate it, especially to provide practical assistance for the procurement and supply of food for the garrison troops, and to strictly prevent dishonest manipulation that would aid the enemy, in order to maintain military and civilian use. Yesterday, it submitted a request to the provincial government to order the counties and cities to comply.</p>
<h3>National Production Conference Opens: Guangdong Province's Wartime Agricultural Plan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The National Production Conference is scheduled to open on the 5th of May. Representatives from various provinces have already reported for duty before the due date, numbering no less than several hundred people. From Guangdong and Guangxi, Guangxi Province has the most proposals. The attendees are Construction Department Director Chen Xiong, Agricultural Management Office Director Chen Daning, and Liuzhou Branch Station Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station Ma Baozhi. From Guangdong Province, in addition to Industrial Management Office Director Wei Baoxiang, Gu Guifen, Dean of the College of Agriculture at Lingnan University, is unable to attend and has been replaced by He Boping, Commissioner of the Agricultural Products Promotion Association. Mr. He was recently invited by the authorities to come to Guangdong to conduct inspections and provide assistance. Mr. He has completed his inspection and returned to Chongqing to report, and has drafted an outline of the Guangdong Wartime Agricultural Plan, which is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Wartime Agricultural Plan Outline - Introduction</p>
<p>We have been resisting violence, promoting justice, and striving for national freedom and equality in this war of resistance for over twenty months. Under the grand premise of "Victory First," we must not only mobilize the nation's manpower, financial resources, and materials to deal with the enemy, but also cultivate national strength and increase production to provide long-term support and secure the victory. Our country is founded on agriculture. Wartime agricultural production is the primary foundation of the war economy and should be vigorously developed to achieve success. Guangdong is a coastal province, and food production is particularly insufficient. At this moment, as the military situation is unfolding, we must take overall consideration and plan comprehensively to meet the needs of the wartime environment, reducing the central authorities' concerns and burdens. Since Guangzhou fell to the enemy, the relocation of people from the war zones and refugee relief have been of utmost importance. If we can improve agriculture throughout the province and cultivate all the districts, then disaster relief efforts will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort, so as not to merely treat the head when it hurts or the foot when it hurts, while the problem remains difficult to resolve completely. Agricultural technology, in peacetime, requires both knowledge and experience, improvement and supervised implementation, all based on scientific principles, proceeding step by step to achieve the ultimate goal. In wartime, we should concentrate young people who are rich in agricultural knowledge and experience and can work hard and strive forward, delve into the countryside, thoroughly improve farmers' living habits, raise farmers' educational standards, stabilize the rural economy and finance, and at the same time, promote short-term crops with the results of scientific research, spread improved seeds, and advocate the widespread planting of miscellaneous grains, both considering academic theories and closely fitting practical needs, striving to improve quality and increase quantity, balancing supply and demand, to achieve the goal of consolidating the national economy and completing the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation. President Kong intends to convene a national production conference in the near future to promote national production and strengthen the war effort, with the aim of conducting a comprehensive review of national production and establishing a comprehensive development plan for balanced implementation. Based on this purpose, I have drafted an outline of the Guangdong Wartime Agricultural Plan, as detailed below, for adoption. These humble opinions may not be of much help. I respectfully ask for corrections from wise people at home and abroad.</p>
<p>(1) Improving Agricultural Administrative Organizations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, considering that the administrative organizations in various provinces were complex, disorganized, wasteful, and ineffective, urged all provinces to consolidate all original agricultural agencies and establish agricultural improvement institutes for unified planning and greater efficiency. This province (the original Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry had a large organization and high expenses, focusing on science, while neglecting the promotion of agriculture in villages, wasting resources and achieving little effect, especially felt during wartime), should reorganize the bureau into the Guangdong Agricultural Improvement Institute (with a simple organization, strict management, and intensified supervision and promotion of agricultural work throughout the province) to meet the urgent needs of the environment. This aligns with the central government's intention to promote agriculture, and the method for subsidizing agricultural improvement expenditures in various provinces, announced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on May 18, 1938, can be cited to apply for a subsidy of half of the institute's operating expenses, to facilitate its operations. Once the administrative organization is improved to perfection, all plans will be easily implemented.</p>
<p>(2) Actively Establishing Provincial Agricultural Extension Agencies</p>
<p>To increase agricultural production, develop the rural economy, and improve farmers' lives, we should disseminate the excellent results of our agricultural research and experimentation to farmers for improvement. To achieve this goal, an extension system must be established, with the Agricultural Products Promotion Committee responsible for supervising the implementation of agricultural extension affairs nationwide. According to the draft outline of the National Agricultural Extension Implementation Plan regarding provincial extension organization regulations, this province should have the Agricultural Improvement Institute set up agricultural affairs and implementation offices, and an agricultural extension office. At the same time, the Construction Department should, in conjunction with the Provincial Party Headquarters and other relevant agricultural extension agencies, establish a Provincial Agricultural Extension Coordination Association to jointly discuss and brainstorm, to increase work efficiency. What is particularly important is the completion of extension organizations in each county, which is the most important foundation of an extension agency. We should carefully consider the environment and handle it cautiously. The Agricultural Products Promotion Committee has drafted several different formats for the organization of extension agencies in each county, to be adopted flexibly according to local conditions, including: (A) those promoted and established by the provincial agricultural extension authority, (B) those promoted and established by the county government, (C) those promoted and established by farmers' organizations, and (D) those directly promoted and established by the central authority. It is believed that since the province has established an extension organization, it should be initiated by the provincial extension organization, in conjunction with the relevant organizations in each county and province, and request technical and economic assistance from the central government.</p>
<p>(3) Regulating the Marketing of Agricultural Products in Various Regions</p>
<p>Since the relocation of the war zone in this province, both exports and imports have been difficult. The agricultural products in various regions have either been lost due to panic or due to surplus, and have not been reasonably regulated. The Ministry of Economic Affairs considered food regulation to be of utmost importance and drafted measures for food regulation during extraordinary times, which were announced by the Executive Yuan last June and instructed all provincial governments and the Agricultural Products Bureau's adjustment offices to comply with. Recently, some counties in Chaozhou and Shantou in this province have experienced rice shortages. The reasons are complex, but the lack of a well-functioning provincial regulation mechanism has had a significant impact. This province urgently needs to establish a sound transportation mechanism, and the greatest efforts must be made in market management and traffic adjustment.</p>
<p>(4) Launching a Rural Financial Mobilization Campaign throughout the Province</p>
<p>Our people have traditionally had a habit of hoarding money, especially farmers. Farmers are willing to endure hardship, save on food and clothing, and accumulate gold and silver jewelry. Even when they are extremely poor, they are often unwilling to pawn the gold and silver jewelry they acquired at their wedding. Farmers are ignorant and often bury these ornaments underground, believing this is the safest way to store them. According to general estimates, there are at least hundreds of millions of dollars still stored in rural areas throughout the country. This province should launch a province-wide rural gold and silver mobilization campaign, conduct large-scale and effective publicity, ensuring that farmers understand the meaning of the war of resistance and the use of ornaments, and earnestly encourage them to purchase them through persuasion. Overseas Chinese, who have lived abroad for a long time, are very patriotic and have always been eager to help. We should encourage them to invest in rural production and establish clear regulations as a clear sign of credibility. As for adjusting rural finance, it is a matter of utmost urgency, which is the responsibility of the financial authorities, so I will not offer presumptuous opinions. (Continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Chaplin's New Film "The Great Dictator" Plot to be Officially Released at the End of September</h3>
<p>"The Great Dictator," currently in production, is the most watched film right now. The scope of attention is not limited to Hollywood, but the world, and even Hitler is watching closely.</p>
<p>"The Great Dictator" is attracting attention for three reasons: first, it is Chaplin's first film in four years since "Modern Times"; second, Chaplin officially speaks in this film; and third, in this film, there is extremely humorous and sharp satire of the head of a certain dictatorship.</p>
<p>In the past, we only knew that the story of "The Great Dictator" would be set in a country under the rule of a certain dictator. Chaplin plays two important roles in this film, one is a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the other is the dictator of this country.</p>
<p>In early March of this year, the film officially started filming. A reporter interviewed him about the film's news and Chaplin's own opinions. At that time, Chaplin only said: "I don't want to tell you for the time being, but I want you to know that there will be a big scene in this film that requires many actors, and I want to use as many Jews and Germans as possible."</p>
<p>Now, Chaplin has publicly released the content of "The Great Dictator." The script was written by an unknown British writer living in Los Angeles, titled "The Great Dictator," and another title is: "The Story of a Small # in a World Full of Sharks." As for the plot, it tells the adventure story of a "fool" named Charlie.</p>
<p>The general situation of the story is as follows:</p>
<p>"In 1912, 'Bordamania' and 'Irie' went to war. 'Fool' Charlie is a private in the 'Bordamania' army. When the war ends, he is the only survivor of the team. When he returned to the capital of 'Bordamania', 'Bordda', everything had changed and was very different from before the war. One day, he was taking a nap when he was suddenly awakened by a team of advancing troops, who were whipping the people to 'support' the dictator of 'Bordamania', Hiegel. Startled, Charlie fled into a restaurant, where the restaurant owner gave him a free meal. As a result, all the restaurant's furniture was destroyed by the advancing troops, and Charlie was sent to a concentration camp by the army. But one day he escaped. From then on, he had good luck. That day, the dictator Hiegel was traveling incognito. Because the two looked alike, the guards recognized Charlie as their leader, while the real dictator Hiegel entered the concentration camp as a person pretending to be a leader. Charlie had good luck, and gave a speech to the people, and his beautiful speech made the people of the country very happy. The ending is: 'Fool' Charlie wakes up from his dream and finds that he is still detained in the concentration camp..."</p>
<p>After reading the content of this script, we already know who the satirical target of this film is. Of course, the jokes in the whole film must be very rich. No wonder Chaplin announced the general content of this film, and the entire American movie fans paid more attention to "The Great Dictator." This film started shooting in early March and will probably be released in September of this year. At that time, the happiness of movie fans and the # anger of the dictator must be predictable. Let's wait and see.</p>
<h3>Theatrical Activities in Chengdu</h3>
<p>Last May, a "Sichuan Traveling Troupe" appeared in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, and set off to perform plays or sing in the border areas. In those places, some residents did not even know that China and Japan had gone to war, because these places usually cannot receive radio broadcasts and newspapers. After seven months, they recently returned to Chengdu.</p>
<p>The troupe includes thirteen male members and six female members, implementing a kind of collective collaboration and collective life. In seven months, they contacted about one million people. As for the lives of the troupe members, they are very hard, and each person only receives one yuan per month for pocket money.</p>
<p>The plays performed included "Put Down Your Whip," "The Sacrifice of September 18," "Defend Lugou Bridge," "Poison," etc., and the slogans shouted were "Those who have strength give strength, those who have money give money," "Total War of Resistance," etc.</p>
<p>After returning to Chengdu, they performed the play "Three Rivers," which tells the story of a person in "Manchukuo" organizing a guerrilla army. Later, they also performed "Crossing the Yellow River." Like them, similar troupes have now spread all over China. In terms of art, they are not necessarily the most advanced, but the actors are sincere and enthusiastic, making them extremely important figures in China's war of resistance.</p>
<p>In addition, under the name of the Ministry of Education, there is also a "Traveling Singing Troupe." Many of the leaders and members of this group are graduates of the Shanghai National Conservatory of Music. There are a total of eighteen young men and women. They are now traveling and singing in various cities in Sichuan, making people understand why China must struggle. The songs they sing are also rhythmic, and the meaning is to seek China's freedom and independence.</p>
<p>Universities from all over China that have moved to Chengdu, students also united and often perform ancient music dramas, collecting donations and contributing to the country. Among them, the Wartime Service Group of the Five Universities performed a play called "Goodbye, Tokyo," which was written by a Japanese student, describing the various oppressions encountered by Chinese students studying in Japan, and some Japanese scholars also expressed their dislike of the war.</p>

<p>He kept singing in front of the mirror as he entered the bathroom. The tune was even brighter. With a bang, the glass on the washbasin stand fell. His singing was cut off. He tiptoed back into the bedroom.</p>
<p>He was falling asleep when Doris cried, "Are you asleep?"</p>
<p>"Uh."</p>
<p>After a while, he said again: "Mother and Uncle Hugo have already come back tonight."</p>
<p>Leona was motionless for a while, then he lifted the quilt, turned over and sat on the edge of the bed. Doris's back was facing him, and he could see her clearly in the moonlight. "That's going to start again," he said softly. Alas, Hugo is back in Europe again!</p>
<p>She asked, "I don't understand what you mean."</p>
<p>"If I see that thing, Hugo, in the house, I will kick him out, you understand?"</p>
<p>"Understood, my love," she replied.</p>
<p>He lay down again. Hugo—that hateful singing teacher—Leona decided that Hugo's coming at this time would cause trouble. But he had a way to deal with it. Thinking of this, he fell asleep. Looking back on the matter afterwards, Leona never understood how it happened. He only knew that he didn't understand women's psychology very well.</p>
<p>After he sent Hugo out of the apartment, Doris still continued to learn to sing. Once Doris was going to perform at a concert at City Hall, he forced all his acquaintances to buy tickets, and sure enough, all the tickets were sold out? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Doubles Tennis Semifinals: He and Li Achieve Glorious Victory, Overwhelming the Lin Brothers to Win the Finals</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Open Doubles Grass Court Tennis Semifinals took place yesterday afternoon between the Lin Brothers and He Jialiu and Li Rurong. On the eve of the great battle, no one could predict that the He and Li pair would win. Although their tenacity and strategy had driven away many famous players, when they met the Lin Brothers, who had been cooperating for many years and were strong and fierce, everyone thought that they were more likely to suffer a defeat. Unexpectedly, the fate of the Lin Brothers was similar to that of the Navy team, a strong team in this year's Group A football league. At this critical moment, they were defeated by the He and Li pair. Not only was there no hope for the championship, but even the runner-up position was lost.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the He and Li pair thoroughly understood the opponent's weaknesses, avoided the heavy and took the light, and adopted a strategy of overcoming strength with softness. Therefore, when the two good partners encountered the opponent's fierce shots, they stood on the baseline and steadily returned high balls that were soft and tough, making the two Lins dazzled. When there was a good opportunity, Old Li would rush to the net and use a soft horizontal or backhand to beat them, making it impossible for the two Lins to cope. Although Old He had some mistakes, it did not hurt the overall situation. His forehand sweep often had accurate landing points. When Da Linzhen encountered some trouble, he felt like an elephant being disturbed by a small mouse. At the same time, the tenacious defense method of He and Li was very strong, not afraid of being hit or pressed. The two Lins always adopted a soft way, which was exactly what they planned. This point made the two Lins defeated and lost all three sets.</p>
<p>The performance of the two Lins was not below their usual standard. Their good skills in blocking the net were performed as usual. Unfortunately, the violent pressure could not kill the soft counterattacks of He and Li. In the fierce battle, Da Linzhen's temper was tested by the opponent. Therefore, He and Li always sent the counterattacking ball to Da Linzhen's side, making him exhausted. Little Linzhen on the side could not help. Therefore, Da Lin's forehand fierce shot gradually weakened. In the life-and-death moment of the last set, he was unable to counterattack. Little Linzhen was also powerless, so he failed. He and Li thus won the final with the Xu brothers. Such a good work is also proud.</p>
<h3>Game Process</h3>
<p>First set After the contest, Old He first showed off his power, and with Old Li's cooperation from the side, he took the first game. From then on, the battle situation gradually became tense. The fight was very interesting. When they held on to five to four, the two Lins still took the lead. Suddenly, Old He volleyed the ball and tied the score to five to five. Then it was six to six. At this time, Da Linzhen shot at Old Li's position, and Old Li was broken repeatedly. Fortunately, Old He was brave and good at fighting, attacking from far and near, and doing everything with ease. He held on to seven to seven and then recovered the critical situation, and its turning point was also based on this. Finally, under the repeated efforts, Old He performed uniquely, and Old Li also cooperated properly. He won two more games and won the first set with nine to seven.</p>
<p>Second set The two Lins lost the first battle and hoped to recover the lost ground, sometimes retreating and drawing from afar, and sometimes pressing on the net, coming fiercely. He and Li had to take a step back for the time being. However, Old He was experienced after all and saw the opponent's weakness, often attacking Da Linzhen's side. In addition, Old Li's pressure in front of the net was always advantageous. The situation turned for the better again. After tying the score to three to three, he achieved a complete victory in one breath and won the second set with six to three.</p>
<p>Third set He and Li took advantage of the victory and became more and more energetic, but the Lin brothers were not weak after all and still thought about reversing the situation. However, Da Linzhen was exhausted after two sets of hard fighting. He and Li refused to relax and specialized in opposing him, making Little Linzhen on the side unable to help. Therefore, when the battle reached four to four, the two Lins revealed flaws again. Even if they tried hard to struggle, they would lose as soon as they got it. The situation was extremely tense from five to five to six to six. Moreover, the two Lins were thinking about it at this time. The eagerness to win backfired and made things worse. They were suppressed by He and Li, and their footing was unstable, so the general trend was gone. At eight to six, He and Li completed the last set and won the glorious victory. The results are as follows</p>
<p>He Jialiu Li Rurong</p>
<p>win</p>
<p>Da Linzhen Xiao Linzhen</p>
<p>Nine to seven</p>
<p>Six to three</p>
<p>Eight to six</p>
<h3>South China vs. Sailors Rescheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the end of the football season, many teams have retired and rested, but the players of South China are still active on the green field to prepare for the South Levy.</p>
<p>Today, a practice match was originally scheduled with the sailors of the British warship "Desperate" at Jia Hill.

If an accident occurs, the alarm bell will sound naturally. The administrator Zeng Boyuan said, "Although this venue is now open, there are not many men and women who come to swim every day. This is certainly because the weather is not too hot yet.</p>
<p>In this transition between old and new staff, there are still many things that have been put on hold. Once the new staff takes over, there may be various additions to this venue. The water games association will be held soon. "</p>

The facilities of the venue are orderly and tidy, giving everyone who comes to the venue to relax a feeling of being in the Guanghan Palace. Especially when admiring the moonlit night with the sea breeze, sitting on the bridge and listening to the sound of the sea waves, it is really unforgettable.</p>
<p>The group photo before the doubles tennis final was taken by Yuan Zhen</p>

If he is not stage-frightened, he should satisfy the audience. Ng Ki Cheung has fully recovered, and may not play this week, but his excellent shot in the match against the Scott team may reappear. Chan Bing Si has made extraordinary progress recently and is good at fast attacks. The Macao team will definitely be threatened by him. In short, at a time when soccer is dull, this wonderful competition will be like a refreshing drink for soccer fans. It is heard that the ticket prices have been determined after discussions with the Hong Kong Football Association yesterday: one dollar, fifty cents, and thirty cents.</p>

<h3>Philippine Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— —Hui Tang—</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This year's soccer events have come to a close. The Hong Kong Football Association has taken the opportunity to reciprocate and invite the Philippine team, so as to show respect for the courtesy of exchange. I recall that at the beginning of the year, the Philippine team came to us for the first time, communicating the voices of the soccer circles in the two places, strengthening the friendship between the two associations, and laying a permanent foundation for the inter-city competition, adding a golden page to the history of Hong Kong soccer. The contribution of the pioneers cannot be ignored. Although the team returned north with three defeats in Hong Kong, their fighting spirit is worthy of praise. Those who know the situation say that their level of soccer skill is similar to that of the Hong Kong side. I agree with this view. However, this time the Hong Kong team is invading the south, facing advantages of timing, location and popularity. Moreover, fighting under the lights at night is not what the Hong Kong people are used to. Enthusiastic people, both Chinese and foreigners, are worried about our team. Some even ask me, as the leader of the team, about the chances of winning this trip. Their concern is overflowing in their words. I said that competing in the Philippines is a bit too hot. The South China players all have considerable experience in night games and will not suffer too much. If there are no surprises, then considering the strength, there should be good news coming back to Hong Kong to comfort the soccer fans. However, soccer matches are always changing, and who can predict the outcome? Everyone should do their best and strive to achieve the goal. That is all I can say about judging oneself and others.</p>
<p>Setting Sail on April 27th</p>
<p>Our team's return trip to the Philippines has been planned and prepared in advance, and all passport procedures have been completed. We are scheduled to depart on the President Cleveland tonight at one o'clock. According to the shipping company, the team includes eight members of the National Army, two Portuguese soldiers, and four foreign soldiers. Little Shi has been excused due to a sudden illness of a colleague. The team leader "Limping" A-chi, and the association representative Jian Jin, are also with us. Counting them all, there are eighteen people. There are also my colleague and old friend Mr. Liang Zao-ru, and Ms. Gao Shan-nu, who are accompanying us on the trip. With such a harmonious group, this trip will not be lonely. After dinner, around ten o'clock, everyone boarded the ship. At the pier, there were staff members from the Hong Kong Football Association and the South China Athletic Association, reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, and relatives and friends of the team members, more than a hundred people in all, sitting around in the smoking room, sharing drinks and having a good time. My six-year-old daughter Shan-shan, encouraged by her older siblings, performed dances, sword dances, and operas to entertain the guests, earning endless laughter. Someone said that she would become Hong Kong's Shirley Temple. I gave her a ten-dollar bill as a reward for her hard work, which she immediately handed over to her mother, and then jumped and cheered with pride. At midnight, the farewell party ended, and everyone shook hands and wished us victory, with great sincerity and earnestness. Fortunately, it was only a short separation, so there was no need to be too emotional. "The water in Kowloon Bay is a thousand feet deep, but it is not as deep as the affection of those who see me off." The friendship of relatives and friends is worth remembering. In particular, the eccentric in the soccer field "Silent Man" was reluctant to leave and repeatedly gestured to me, earnestly asking me to send him reports of the soccer matches. I appreciated his sincerity and nodded in agreement, and he left with joy. After the ship set sail, I realized that I had played tennis for almost two hours during the day, and then I had to pack my luggage. Both my mind and body were exhausted. I changed clothes and fell asleep as soon as I got into bed. Although the cargo ship was rattling and the sound was like spring thunder, it was not enough to disturb my good dreams.

<h3>Drizzle</h3>
<p>— Jie Jie</p>
<p>An unexpected drizzle started again, so fine that it was like the tip of an autumn hair, flying onto the glass window and blurring it.</p>
<p>The drizzle flew to the earth, and the tiny water droplets merged together, wetting the earth.</p>
<p>The drizzle flew onto people's faces, like steel needles, pricking the face painfully.</p>
<p>The drizzle also flew onto people's bodies, drilling into the gaps in their clothes, squeezing out water.</p>
<p>This drizzle falls again and again, continuously. What is it for after all?</p>
<p>The earth is covered with dust, dirt, meanness, and shamelessness. It suffocates people's breathing, obscures people's vision, taints pure people with filth, and suppresses noble people. The devil takes the opportunity to rampage, and the world is going crazy!</p>
<p>People, in this situation, completely lost their minds, as if they had taken an incurable drug, unable to distinguish everything, without any resistance, obediently prostrating at the feet of the devil, allowing the devils to play with them and bully them.</p>
<p>The careers that people are engaged in have all come to a standstill because they have lost their masters. What is destroyed is destroyed, what is defiled is defiled, and they can no longer emit the light that they once did to assist people. The entire society is immediately regressing, and will never move forward.</p>
<p>Darkness engulfs the whole world…</p>
<p>The drizzle cannot bear this situation, it does not want to endure it any longer, it wants to wash and purify the whole world, drive away the devil, so that dust, dirt, meanness, and shamelessness will never grow again. It gathers its courage, although its strength is so small. But it flies relentlessly, once, twice, three times, flying, flying, flying.</p>
<p>The glass window is blurred, it is making people wipe it, driving away the darkness and seeing the light again.</p>
<p>The earth is wet, it is making people wash away the dust and dirt, to obtain clarity.</p>
<p>People's faces ache, it is making people alert, not to dream anymore, quickly extinguish the external attacks and arrogance.</p>
<p>Drilling into the fabric of clothes, it is making people have the courage and perseverance to stop the devil's erosion, and to strive to resist!</p>
<p>Falling again and again, it is training people to have a lasting spirit to fight, not allowing them to stop in the middle!</p>
<p>Oh, the continuous drizzle, how great it is!</p>
<p>We uphold the spirit of struggle, we receive the suggestion of the drizzle, we come to purify our society, and apply it to the entire earth. The light is ahead!</p>
<p>The misty drizzle flying outside the window is the lamp to abolish darkness!</p>
<h3>The Destruction of Flattering Education</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yi</p>
<p>The commercialization of schools, where knowledge is a commodity and students are customers, has become a common phenomenon in the education sector here. If it were not so, no one would care about your school. However, how to ensure that the customers you attract are all wealthy, and how to increase the number of customers day by day, has become a difficult problem that principals are painstakingly pondering. This has given rise to "business geniuses."</p>
<p>This place is full of gentlemen and rich people. When a gentleman or a rich person buys an item, the quality of the contents does not matter to him, it is the expensiveness and gorgeousness of the decoration that please him most. Good quality and low prices would make them feel that their status has been lowered, and would inevitably be met with their contempt and resentment.</p>
<p>Sending their children to school is no exception. Catering to the wishes of these gentlemen and rich people, educational opportunists put gorgeous shells on their shoddy goods. This can solve the difficult problem they were painstakingly pondering. What outstanding "business geniuses!"</p>
<p>In a school standing on the hillside, patriotic songs have disappeared and jazz music has taken its place. The music teacher said: Patriotic songs are not suitable in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>What kind of students does this kind of school educate? It is almost impossible to find a pragmatic and diligent one among them. Their extravagance in life is not inferior to the enthusiasm of their parents for enjoyment, nor is it less than their fathers and brothers. Teachers who dress simply will inevitably be despised by them. Even the simplest question is foreign to them. They will not only not be "the future masters of the country," but will be "harmful elements of the country's future." They cannot take on the responsibility of "the future masters of the country," but will only consume the country's production.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, many progressive schools have moved here from the mainland. Some students who still have reason have been awakened and have left the dangerous side and gradually moved towards progress. A struggle has begun to threaten the education of flattery. It is hoped that these progressive schools can, in their own solidness and strength, eradicate this education of flattery. Because this education is just a speculation that caters to the hedonism of the gentlemen and rich people. The direction is wrong, and the effect produced is harmful. Eradication is necessary.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Celebrating Youth Day (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Zheng Yao, Xie Yu De</p>
<p>(5) The work is isolated, and there is no contact with student movements at home and abroad. In fact, the Hong Kong student movement was originally inseparable from the world student movement. Only by establishing close ties with the world student movement can the Hong Kong student movement have a bright future. In addition, the inability of participating students to adapt to the environment, abandoning schoolwork, and acting in opposition to their families are also shortcomings of the Hong Kong student movement.</p>
<p>With the increasing tension of the war situation, schools in the war zone and occupied areas have moved south to Hong Kong one after another. In this way, Hong Kong not only became an important city in the rear of our country during the war, but also became the center of the Chinese student movement. Therefore, our responsibility in the future is even greater. We should quickly overcome the shortcomings of our past work and take on the urgent tasks at hand.</p>
<p>The current tasks of the Hong Kong student movement are:</p>
<p>(1) Prepare for wartime work. The international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and a second world war is likely to recur today. Before the war comes, we should raise the awareness of Hong Kong students about the war and encourage them to participate in various wartime technical training classes, such as first aid classes, air defense and anti-virus classes, etc. In this way, even if the war unfortunately breaks out, students staying in Hong Kong can assist the Allied governments to strengthen the defense of the port. Those who return to the country will also have a skill that can directly participate in the national liberation war.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthening international propaganda and striving for international assistance is one of the important conditions for winning the final victory. Hong Kong is an area where Chinese and foreigners gather. On the one hand, it is close to the motherland, and on the other hand, it is connected to overseas countries. In addition, the foreign language level of students here is higher than that in the mainland. Therefore, strengthening international propaganda and making the atrocities of the invaders in China known to the world has become one of the most important tasks of the Hong Kong student movement in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Conscientiously promote the National Spiritual Mobilization. The National Spiritual Mobilization advocated by the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek is the most historically significant movement of the Chinese nation. Students are the vanguard of the Chinese national liberation, and undoubtedly, they should promote this movement with all their strength. We should not only enable all students in Hong Kong to have a thorough understanding of the meaning of "national supremacy, national supremacy, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," but also enable them to automatically correct their decadent lives, develop an enterprising spirit, break the attempts of selfishness and self-interest, and correct divergent and mixed ideas. In short, we must ensure that the phenomenon of "one side is serious work and the other side is debauchery and shamelessness" does not exist in the Hong Kong student community.</p>
<p>(4) Broadly develop various life interest activities and conscientiously promote the reading of books and newspapers. According to the different interests of the students in each school, broadly develop different organizations for each subject, such as singing classes, reading clubs, harmonica classes, travel groups, photography research classes, swimming teams, etc., so that all students in Hong Kong can unite in different interest activities for each subject. At the same time, natural sciences and emerging social sciences related to the War of Resistance and national construction, as well as new and progressive newspapers and magazines, should also be systematically introduced to the students in each school.</p>
<p>In addition, promoting central cultural cooperation and strengthening fundraising activities have also become the main tasks of the Hong Kong student movement in the future.</p>
<p>Dear students, the tasks placed before us are arduous. Let us unite, concentrate our strength, and accomplish our great tasks!</p>
<h3>Drifters</h3>
<p>— Le Shu</p>
<p>It was a late afternoon, with a great deal of blowing sand, when we arrived at our destination, Tasha County in northwestern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>A long, flowing group advanced windingly forward. In the twilight, thousands of human figures drifted, stepping on the soft, powdery soil. One shadow touching another, connected into an endless iron great wall, the end of which, with its iron tail, was hidden from sight.</p>
<p>To reduce the size of the target, this iron torrent flowed into every village, spreading out into places that could mutually support each other.</p>
<p>I was a member of a certain unit. There were about twenty of us in total, and we found a place to rest in Jizhuang, a village about half a mile from Jieshan City. Preliminary work began in this ancient and simple village.</p>
<p>The common people did not cast horrified glances at the gray shadows, but rather expressions of excitement flowed from every simple face. Even the elderly would come, leaning on their canes, to offer warm greetings as if to their own sons. What they held within was a joyful heart. This could be sensed from every clear and hurried breath.</p>
<p>News spread quickly in the village. Within half an hour of our arrival, the courtyard was filled with dozens of innocent children, all of school age. Each child raised their head and opened their eyes wide, blinking repeatedly. They made no sound, paying attention, listening to every unfamiliar action and every unfamiliar word of our group, like paying attention in a classroom. Here we were, scrutinizing their lovable faces, how deeply impressed we were.</p>
<p>We began to chat haphazardly in Mandarin. They seemed a little strange to us changing to a different language, but understanding our generalizations without effort, they all quickly shifted their bodies into a more casual posture. In the dim starlight, their faces could faintly be seen blushing, and their eyes sparkled with crystal light, making them listen with even more excitement. They eagerly answered the questions we asked.</p>
<p>There was no sense of strangeness, no hesitation. We were as close as brothers reunited after a long separation.</p>
<p>They told us that they were still studying at the village elementary school less than two miles away, and that they were not shaken in their determination by the threat of gunfire. They told us their names, and the older children even explained the simple meaning of the current resistance war, which they had retrieved from the memory of what their teacher had said.</p>
<p>So we suggested a few songs that everyone knew and asked them to sing along with us. They understood simple rounds and even understood to watch the movements of my hand to determine the pitch and tempo of the sound.</p>
<p>The sharp singing resounded throughout this quiet village.</p>
<p>Small children, big children, men, women, flowed into a vast sea of people. The adults wanted to call the children to eat dinner, but they were captivated by the singing and did not speak their words. The children even forgot that their stomachs were hungry.</p>
<p>The majestic singing spread throughout the fields, penetrating deep into everyone's hearts.</p>
<h3>Intoxication</h3>
<p>— Liu Yi</p>
<p>It is like a sweet smile, permeating people's souls, obscuring their reason, making them forget everything, even themselves!</p>
<p>As if gone mad, when people encounter that intoxicating dream, intoxicating wine, intoxicating laughter, intoxicating singing, and everything with seductive magic, they are like lost in a maze. They love this intoxication, this intoxication containing poison.</p>
<p>But people's hearts are so haggard that they cannot withstand the slightest anesthesia. When they are trapped in this abyss, they do not even know that they have entered the land of intoxication. They think they are still the most sober people.</p>
<p>Those who are intoxicated are not as good as those in a dream. That dangerous and precarious situation, that attraction hiding evil intentions, in their minds, they think this is the giving of an enthusiastic person, the most valuable prelude.</p>
<p>In the land of intoxication, all troubles are abandoned, all dangers are forgotten, and people are surrounded by joy!</p>
<p>That wine, that dream, that laughter, that singing... makes people obsessed with them, makes people dive into their whirlpools, that is intoxication.</p>
<p>Intoxication, no one sees that it is terrible, and no one believes that it has given people many unfavorable attacks. Intoxication has an "insidiousness" that makes people unexpected. This is intoxication, the most terrible thing in the world, the most to be avoided!</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Hey, don't be angry, wait a minute."</p>
<p>He hoped she would see for herself, which would have the opposite effect of reading the newspaper. He was afraid that after opening the door, she would be humiliated and his secret would be revealed, so he had to guide her eyes to the keyhole next to the door for a furtive peek. The moment she saw it, she couldn't help but shout:</p>
<p>"You beasts... not human, not human!... Do you still have a bit of human form?... You are even worse than dogs——"</p>
<p>He covered her mouth with his hand, letting her continue to watch quietly. Her words were stopped, but unstoppable tears, like a broken string of pearls, fell one by one. If she were not weak, she would rush out and duel with the two most immoral drunks outside the door. She would rather be defeated than be tolerant. If her emotions were further stimulated, he would use the sharp knife he used on Yuwen last night to deal with them—even if she knew the result would be the same as last night, or worse. Therefore, she was dragged away.</p>
<p>That brief moment made her deeply aware of the injustice of this world. Between people, there are still masters and slaves. One side is arrogant, so arrogant that they forget themselves, and the other side is lowly, so lowly that they are invisible. Before this kidnapping, she had grown up in a family almost isolated from this world. No matter how she recalled the family's past, it was all happy and joyful memories. Now, she was just beginning to enter this world to live. She should be grateful to the person who led her into this world—Yuwen, the volunteer soldier.</p>
<p>If she had a good impression of Yuwen, the volunteer soldier, that good impression was influenced in this way. If she had a determination to take revenge on the enemy, that determination was made in this way. If she had a deeper yearning for the motherland, that yearning was aroused in this way. If she had a new hatred for her father, that hatred began in this way. If she had greater unease, that unease came in this way.</p>
<p>Indeed, she was uneasy, because her young and weak reason could not yet analyze or control the chaotic emotions stirred up by a moment.</p>
<p>He was afraid that she would suffer from unnecessary unease, so he was trying to persuade her:</p>
<p>"You should feel at ease!"</p>
<p>"Alas, nothing I see allows me to feel at ease!"</p>
<p>"You should feel at ease, as if you were at home."</p>
<p>"Hmph, this is not my home. Here, there is no mother or father, not a single relative!"</p>
<p>"Relatives are not necessarily people who love you, and we have no malice towards you. Don't you know what kind of person your father is, and what kind of people we are? You used to be a high school student, and now you are still a good youth, you should know these things! Am I not right?"</p>
<p>"I know what my father is... No matter what, he is still my father! Besides, he loves me very much, I know... But don't think that I am like my father! I know what kind of people you are: But how exactly will you treat me?" (57)</p>
