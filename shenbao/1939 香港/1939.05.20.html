<h3>戰青年的苦悶</h3>
<p>近來時時收到各地靑年寄來傾訴苦悶的函件，從這種函件中可以看出目前抗戰進入新的艱苦時期，各地所發生的幾種矛盾現象：譬如　方面是政府及其他軍事經濟外交各機構之大鬧『人才飢荒』，另一方面仍有成千成萬的專門人才和優秀的靑年幹部，在四面八方發出『投効無路』的吶喊；一方面是戰區，×後，及後方各地，迫急需求各地靑年尤其是僑胞囘國囘鄉服務，而另一方面則仍有許多服務團體的份子在各地發生『工作困難，到處碰壁』的悲愴的嘆息，甚至有許多靑年因此而對抗戰前途悲觀失望起來的。昨天即有一個囘鄉服務的靑年從××方面來函，其中說到：『對這般刻苦耐勞的靑年人，視若東州的地雷，好像不加淸除，卽刻就會爆發似的。這樣，無謂的磨擦就發生了！還好，對方尚明大義，平靜地過去了。但是……這種磨擦非僅一地一時為然，而且還有繼續發展下去的可能。因此不覺心寒齒冷　，對於抗戰的前途也不免要重來估價，自己的思想問題也發生了。……因此我急於求去。』另一位服務團的靑年從××方面來函，則又說：『這裏沒有政治的理想，也沒有看到民族國家而奮鬥的熱情，一幇不三不四的人，本質上已變成衙門，講鄉籍和交情，你想這還有什麼意思再來犧牲學問呢？我堅决要離開這氣圈。』這種抗戰期內靑年的苦悶，一般地說起來，當然是值得注意的一個問題，如果不趕快認眞切賓地予以徹底與適當的解决，對於抗戰建國，自然會有相當重大的不良影響的。</p>
<p>所有這些矛盾的現象與靑年的苦悶以至悲觀失望，雖然有種種特殊的原因，但一般的歸納起來，不外為了以下幾點：第一是地方政治機構的腐敗，第二是少數當局的愚妄怯懦，第三是若千地方封建殘餘勢力的蠱毒，第四是漢奸××動搖妥協份子的造謠誣衊挑撥離間製造各種磨擦，第五是少數靑年對政治認識的不够和服務與工作方式的錯誤。我們認定　上述五點，是非常嚴重的病狀，如果不把這幾種病狀治好，則抗戰建國的偉大事業，一定要受重大的阻礙。然而我們同時更要認淸，這種病狀絕對不是『不治之症』，它是有方法可以治好，而且事實上從抗戰以來，從各地的實際狀况來看，已經或先或後或多或少地呈現着『生色』了！</p>
<p>我們首先要知道，中華民族是半封半殖民地的國家，自從九一八事變直到七七盧溝橋事變，遭遇一個現代的資本帝國主義國家，積六十年謀我之心力，動員其全國的力量，進行武裝的全面進攻，如果那時再不抵抗，則誠如最高領袖所昭示，中國早已實際亡國，而我們全國人民早已實際上變做日本法西斯的殖民地奴隸了！但是靠了最高領袖睿智與英明的領導，靠了國共兩黨以至各民族各階級的親密合作，終於發動了全面抗戰，在英勇鬥爭的二十二個月以來，我們殲殺日×已達八九十萬，消耗日×國富到少亦已達到甚高的成數，而在兩國民衆對於作戰的精神上，而在兩國在國際地位的對比上，一方面是我國之獲得廣大的同情與援助，另一方是日×之日陷孤立以至淪為第二等國家！我們這些成功，其迅速與偉大，在歷史上是空前的！卽就國內政治而論，所有今日政府民衆之站上同一戰線，所有今日國共兩黨以至各民族各階級合作之公開存在以至逐漸發展，所有今日實現民主改善民生堅持抗戰建立獨立自由幸福新中國等等之成為全國一致的輿論，而且被規定在中央的抗戰建國綱領和各省市施政綱領裏面去一，所有今日這種政治上進步的現象，豈復是抗戰以前所可比擬？所敢妄想？當然，我們並不認為現在一切矛盾與使靑年苦悶的痛心現象不足重視，但是我們認為從整個歷史的規律和整個政治形勢發展的曲綫來看，則此種痛心的現象已經是一校逆流或一種餘威，它絕對沒有挽囘歷史的力量，因此一切悲觀失望是沒有根據的！</p>
<p>其次，問題是在於怎樣制止這些逆流或餘威的發展疏導和消滅這些逆流或餘威？我們認為解决這個問題，是目前階段克服新的困難爭取更大勝利奠定成功基礎的全民族共同任務。我們要担負這個任務，第一有賴我們協力同心，遵照國民黨的抗戰建國綱領和最高領袖歷次宣言諭告，推進政治向更廣泛更澈底的改革，主要的是鞏固與擴大全國各黨派各階層的團結統一堅决支持持久抗戰，是認眞檢討與督促抗戰以來一切改進政治的决議案及法令之忠實執行，是力爭相當與必要的民主政治之實現與民衆生活的改善，第二，是要提高民族自尊心與自信心，增加支持抗戰建國的精神力量，主要的是必須普遍切實的推行國民精神總動員綱領和實施辦法，必須加緊和漢奸××，動搖妥協份子的陰謀活動和『反共』，『反蔣』，『和平』等謊謬言論作堅决的鬥爭，根本粉碎日×速戰速决速戰速和以華制華以華滅華的毒計。第三，是必須以加倍的努力，展開集體的學習和修養運動，養成我們每一個靑年都能在危險困苦中堅持戰鬥爭取最後勝利的力量。改進動員一切民衆和戰時服務戰地服務的方法方式。</p>
<p>最後我們要鄭重指出，所有這些，都有賴於我們戰鬥的革命的靑年之團結與奮鬥！祇要我們能够團結奮鬥，什麼逆流與餘威亦不能阻止我們前進！何况整個國際與國內的政治形勢又在在於我們有利呢！靑年是抗戰建國的主力軍，靑年是未來理想之國家的主人翁，我們决不能妄自菲薄，我們决不能畏難退却！古人說『世事不艱難，安用吾輩為』！佛氏說『我不入地獄。誰入地獄』！今日中國之靑年，更應愉快地堅持為求正義與自由而艱苦戰鬥，我們歡迎更大的逆流與餘威，栽們歡迎更大的黑暗與艱險，因為克服了這些之後，就是光明自由一和最後的勝利了！</p>
<h3>開展青年學生運動與青年切身為題</h3>
<p>— 斗光</p>
<p>中國靑年學生運動最大的特點之一，便是一開始就與政治活動緊密的相連繫着，如轟烈悲壯的『五四』『一二九」等運動，是掀起了富有偉大歷史意義的反帝——尤其是反日本帝國主義和反封建的全國性的劃時代的運動。這表現着中國靑年學生的進步性，他們有高度的民族覺悟和政治覺悟，緊握着解决一切社會問題樞紐的政治問題；他們曉得，只有在民唉上社會上求得解放和自由，才能有自己的生存和幸福，只有今日的英勇奮鬥，才有勝利光明的前途。</p>
<p>在今日的民挨革命戰爭的大洪濤里，已是捲起了不少的靑年知識份子，參加抗戰的各鐘工作，他們在前綫，後方和×後方抱着犧牲一切的精神而英勇奮鬥。貢獻了不少的力量來搶救民族國家的危亡。但讓我們再徒這擁有廣大地區的總後方來看，正有不少的靑年却是處在迷糊的環境，靑年學生運動却是處在散漫的，沉寂的氛圍裏，就在活躍着的地方看來不過是代表着一部份進步的靑年；這個，若與今日抗戰形勢的急幣對比起來，還是差得很遠的。有人說這是由於知藏份子本身的弱點。一種怕困難，怕吃苦，易轉變的弱點，其實，這並不是一個充分的理由；這萬的問題，這是一種歷史環境存留下來的條件所限制着的，一種政治上的問題。因為今日還有些人，尤其是負着領導靑年運動，敎育責任中有一些人，對蔣委員畏領導團結抗戰到底，爭取最後勝利的國策，對抗戰建國綱領中國防敎育的方針，對三民主義的革命精神。沒有深切，澈底，正確，具體的了解，或者不願了解；沒有認淸或不願認淸今日靑年遝動的性質，是一種抗日的，民族的，非黨派的性質；沒有體驗到或不願體驗領導靑年運勵，應當有一種積極領導與尊重其獨立性的正確關係的熊度。……這些問題，正是警惕着靑年學生運動應有更密切與政治問題相連繫起來的，更進一歩的去發揚這個特點而鬥爭；使廣大靑年懂得，只有更積極，更深入，更廣泛的起來參加各種抗戰工作，才能求得切身問題的勝利的解决。</p>
<p>那末，為了發揚這個特點，為了開展靑年學生運動，在靑年學生運動上就應該克服這個忽視靑年切身問題的這個缺點，把靑年運動的總任務與靑年切身問題貫通起來。這是今日靑年學生運動的中心環節。什麼是靑年切身的問題呢？</p>
<p>第一學習問題——由於靑年的經驗缺乏，知識薄　，為了謀自己獨立，為了求民族社會的解放，為了達到求進步，求光明的崇高理想，他們都抱有高度的學習精神，去向各方面學習，因此『學習是靑年的任務』之一。但令日却有很多靑年在學習問題上表現着苦悶，憂鬱，消極的病態；尤其是表現在學校里的靑年學住：學校里所授的　程還是那些舊的，與抗戰無關，甚至對立起來的敎材和敎授法與學習法，他們整天都是為應考試而學習，沒有空餘的時間去作課外的活動，去讀報，討論各種政治問題，參加救亡工作，進行體育運動。使一些進步者逐漸的離開學校，一些落後者更在渾沌下去。因此，解决靑年對這個問題的要求，向學校當局提供意見，請學校領導各種問題討論，充實與改革課程上的某些課題，是十分必要的。</p>
<p>其次是對失學靑年，解决他們的學習要求，舉行各種問題座談會，讀書會……等這是很重要的。在戰時環境的影響下，不知失學的靑年多少。</p>
<p>第二是生活問題——在靑年學生生活中的特點，是一種喜活潑，好熱間，與新頴的體育運動和文化娛樂等，他們時常組織各類球隊，歌詠隊，劇團。等等進行比賽，表演，通過和發揮這特點，去達到他們對文化生活的慾求，尤其是創造出各種以抗戰問題為體材的新的活動方式，如練習擲手溜彈，爬山……等，這不只可以恢復學習後，工作後的疲勞，可以鍛鍊出強壯的體魄。且可增加參加抗戰技能。但是使這個閧題能順利的展開起來，過去的那種只限於藝術家，運動家的發展，那種只為錦標主義，宗派主義的觀念，是應毀滅的：這樣才能成為密切彼此的關係，而不是妨害彼此的團結：才能成為互相觀摩的發展，而不是互相嫉忌的排斥。</p>
<p>其次是學校的環境，一種在基本上已把他們組織起來的現境，且靑年本就富有一種合羣性的心理一種你做我也做的希望大家做的心理，很好的運用和發揮這種環境，這些心理，去加緊他們的組織性，建立二種民主的，緊張的，規律的集體生活，鍛鍊出正確的堅定的思想意識，這對于鞏固靑年學生運動的組織是有保障的意義的。</p>
<p>第三是職業問題——本來想是一個社會問題，但在靑年學生正是處於將要自己獨立謀生活的時候，因此也是一個靑年急待解决的切身問題，時常希望着要求着解决自身職業的問題。為了解决這個迫切的要求，去組織職業的互相介紹或互相帮助之類的組織，以求得生活問題的解决：尤其是在今日抗戰處在新的嚴重階段，國家民族大批的人力知力，參加到各種抗戰的工作來：到軍隊去。到前方，到×後方去，國防工業中去，交通建設中去。……使大批靑年有組織的來，服務於抗戰，是很必要的。如目前抗戰形勢在×後開展廣泛的游擊戰爭，摧毀偽政權，增加×人進攻的困雞，使它不能把佔債區域成為更向前進攻的後方，這是有頭頂要意義的。把淪陷區流浪到後方來的靑年組織起來，挺進到他們的老家去發動抗日工作，游擊戰爭，進在他們擁有復仇的滿腔熱血，在地理上人事上又很熟悉，是旣合適又願意去做的一種工作。這是開展靑年學生運動的一個實際的有力的工作。</p>
<p>要能很好的把握上面靑年切身的幾個問題，使　年學生運動順利的展開起來，那來便應有下面幾個主要的方法：</p>
<p>一，團結進步的力量，去團結一切力量。要把工作推動起來，活躍起來，開展起來，那末團結先進的份子，求得行動上的統一，是有主要意義的。但是，不只是應團結靑年學生中進步份子，而且應當團結社會上，學校一切同情者，力求進步的人們，給以積極的幫助和領導，同時對落後者的爭取也是不能放鬆。要求達到這個目的，首先應有寬大的氣量，互相諒解的精神，不是為着某些沒有原則性的小問題的爭執；對一切問題都要從大體上，工作利益上出發，而不是各持極端的對立起來。其次是應有虛心的態度，應尊重人家的意見，且要時刻徵求人家的意見，帮助人家發表意見，互相的討論，若有錯誤，應用說服的精神，去互相糾正；那種只有自家好，別人都要不得的淸高觀念，以自己了不起的英雄主義的思想，是應該克服，毀滅的。</p>
<p>二，深入羣衆。爲着廣大的靑年羣衆都能號召組織起來參加今日各種抗戰工作，了解他們的環境，明瞭他們切身的要求，是非常必要的；那就非深入他們的生活中去不可，這應該隨時隨地的利用各種機會去接近他們，通過各種親戚，朋友，團體，事件的關係去接近他們，運甩各人的個性與興趣去接近他們；不應把交結人家的條件提得太高，理想抱得太連，或是只限制於某些狹窄的範圍內。如人家對你好才去與他接近，人家對你壞就不與他接近；只看到人家的短處。沒看見人家的長處，就作結論的說他不好，不去接近他，輕視他。這種無原則的態度，對工作是一種罪惡。其次為求得人家的信仰，也應盡可能的去帮助他們解决各種困難問題。若是能够越多的通過這些工作去團結起羣衆，就越容易獲得勝利的到來。</p>
<p>三、提高人家與提高自己：要求得深入羣衆，不是庸俗的與他們混合成一圈，而是能把羣衆發動起來，那就應該去提高他們，敎育，鍛煉他們，使他們有一種正確的進步的人生觀和世界觀，使他們認淸今日抗戰形勢與自己任務，能積極的參加到抗戰營壘中來；同時，自己也應該時時在工作中，羣衆中做學習的模範，使自己在理論上，不斷的進步，不斷的提高，去迎接負担這種艱鉅的民族革命的任務。</p>
<p>最後，我們應堅信：抗戰的力量，時代的鐵流，光明的曙輝，已在推動着一切前進，一些阻擋歷史前進的障礙物，一定會被克服和消滅的；不要碰到困難的阻礙時，就消極，苦惱起來、而是應有預見困雞，認淸困難，粉碎困難的百折不撓的奮鬥精神。</p>
<h3>苦難中的西班牙人</h3>
<p>— 法國人道報特派員原作　趙美譯</p>
<p>二月六日自石擺（Ceidife）發——早上三點，我和傳利葉同志跑上通到布港（Bou）的公路。昨天被轟炸了的石擇，在山下一點聲音沒有。山上，一種沉重的聲浪傳下來，</p>
<p>白天，運貨車不停的向山上駛，有時充塞了道路，阻住一大羣人，夜裏車子都停駛，一連車的臥在公路上。</p>
<p>無數的西班牙兵士到達了邊境，在途中延遲了的少數國際縱隊隊員，也都到齊了。大家集合在山的斜坡上。在透明的夜色中，到處都可以見到一排排伸長的身軀，緊緊地用氈裏着。遠處，一長列的運貸車在公路上等着，連連黑影，一直無盡。</p>
<p>在車子密接的縫隙中，不絕的有難民行列通過。男人手提包袱或皮包；女人為疲乏所咬嚙得變野了，拖着沉重的步伐前進。有幾個用布條把嬰兒繫在胸前，因為如果她們的腿還把她們支持着，她們的臂折斷了的垂着。無能為力。巨大的貨車，五十，五十，的向法國駛去。但是等車的時間太長了，自昨天兩點國一直到現在還沒一次到石擺來的車，等得人們心煩意亂，黑暗中的火光，也會使人們歇斯的里地叫起來：要是空襲來了呢。</p>
<p>那是第一可怕的事情。隨着天色漸明，照見還佈着鬆的地中海海面靜靜的波浪，人們的恐怖也增加了。每輛車子裏，堆滿了氈，行李，和躺着動也不動的人們。早上冷得緊啊，蓋着車子的帆布上，也佈了一層白色的霜。</p>
<p>在天色還未大明之前，一聲起行的響號響澈了山谷，於是，灰色的山腹中，紛紛站立起來的，是無數的西班牙民主國的戰士和難民，躺着的黑影都活起來了，開始下山向法國去。（G.Beaukais）</p>
<p>二月六日自派兌斯發——撤退在陰曙的夜裏進行看，沉重的貨車，從路上楓樹旁駛過。可以聽見的是凉鞋和地固的摩擦聲，悽慘的呻吟，和緩慢的抽咽。</p>
<p>派兌斯橋的出口，有一歩兵駐守着。幾支證或酷無情地照出了老人和婦人們愁苦的面孔，孩子們痛苦表情的小臉。大家排成一單人行，分成小組，等着進口，在旁邊的法國守兵，以憐恤的目光，看看這傷心慘目的行列在黑暗中等着。</p>
<p>在這裏，我找到我們的同志巴來（Barel），基也（Grisa），　昂，和地拉幾位議員，他們要在這裏過夜，並隨着難民行列前進，替他們服務。</p>
<p>一種潮濕的寒冷襲人肩背。在山腰要裏，等着進口的難民，等得不耐煩，燃燒了一堆野火取暖，大家圍火團坐。紅色的火焰吞激了黑暗，照耀了樹林和騷動着的人們，這是山谷裏罕有的一夜。</p>
<p>天一亮，守兵們議開一條路給難民通過。用污布包裏着頭和四肢的受傷者，跛行向前：面孔如受了刑，雙眼像發熱病。因為創傷是新有的，因缺乏衛生設備的原故，沒有好好的包紮。每個人都要受搜身：在路邊，一個年靑的軍醫要每個人解開包紥處以便察驗，這對於傷者是多麼的不便，之後，大家集合在附近一指定地點，頃刻人數便滿。但是上無掩蓋，下無昇牀，沒有藥品，也沒有救命與奮劑。國際中央衛生處的同志們很吃力的工作着，因為政府沒有給他們以任何幇助。連戰地病院沒有組成。還不止是不足，而是像一位軍醫所很憤怒地說的：『有意的裝襲』！</p>
<p>傷勢較輕的人扶持斷手斷脚的重傷者，一個女難民引着一個瞎眼的；一個紥着腿部的少年，臥在騾背上不住時吟。</p>
<p>由於汽車夫們的駕駛迅速，雖則汽車數目甚少，但很快的便把女人，小孩和傷者全數載到布路（Boutou）。但第一批走後，緊跟着又到了一批，疲倦得　着腰，手抱着小孩，永遠是遭一傷心　目的行列。　個守兵的軍官用激動的口氣吿訴我四個小孩子的慘狀，叛軍的飛機，只向平民投彈，因此，每經一次空襲，到的難民，幾乎傷者佔大半，其情景使人不忍目睹</p>
<p>守兵們都很好的對待難民們，一個軍官把自己的被子拿來，藍上一位母親和她的嬰孩，然後他又抱了另一凍看的嬰孩一直到汽車上。</p>
<p>另一方面，受傷到不能動的傷者，在橋的前邊，躺在被霧潮濕了的地上，咬緊牙根，等待昇到野戰醫院去。傷勢重的眼看着自己創口合了又重開，且感染了毒，生命每一分鐘都在離開他們。</p>
<p>法政府不能夠早點採取一切必要設施，來幫助他姊妹國的國民嗎？他們的命運，大部分是受法政府外交政策所賜！我們要求法國國防部立刻將所有衛生設備救助難民，不止在道義上應該如此，　且為　答　們為防衛我們的邊境打了這許久起見，也要如此。</p>
<p>（Emlle　Dectolt）</p>
<p>二月廿八日自石擺發——整調晚上，輕民繼讀不斷的到來，直到天明，才漸漸减少。</p>
<p>沿途沒有延攔，我們一直到達這鐵，（Cerhl　）。小小的車站改成了戰地病院，四千受傷的和病人在這裏集合。鐵軌上停了幾輛救護車，載有醫　　品預備用來救治這大羣在充滿泥塵的稻革上的病人。</p>
<p>這些救護車是西班牙的。在這裏等了八天，等待法政府允許牠們通過邊境的命令，不能通過邊境，她們不能帮助病人，現在只有中央衛生處（Centrale　Sanitaire）的醫生和看護在極劣的條件下醫治病人們和受傷者。</p>
<p>如果早點——就是說，八天以前——允準這些救護車進入法境，也許會救治了好多人。但是還有更壞的，是直到現在，法國方面一點醫藥用品都沒有送來，所有在使用着的，都是來自西班牙的。</p>
<p>全部工作，都是中央衛生的英雄　們擔任，除了不停的招呼病人之外，他們還要親自淸掃厕所！是他們去扶！食物和分發食物。有時因為受傷的太多，服務者太少，分發食物竟一直到夜半三點才止。他們做一切工作，另一方面，車站當局却惡意妨碍他們工作。我們已經說過有人尅扣糧食中午，難民們只得到一大匙扁豆，或者碗豆，一條香腸，一點奶餅和二小片麵包。下午，更小了，而且常常是冷的。我們知道法政府每天付七·五〇法郎給每個難民，如果主管糧食的人是忠誠的話，每個人應該有一噸富豐的飱。</p>
<p>因此我們便可明白為什麼許多受傷者在受第一次外科手術時便支持不住了：食物的缺乏，使他們受不了手術。</p>
<p>中央衛生處的同志們有鑒於此，曾經向當局請求准許他們來擔任預備食物，事實上，法國各地人民所捐助來的食物，可以為難民們預備很好的叙飱，但是當局所給的答覆，是斷然拒絕。中央衛生處於是請求准許他們辦軍隊式的流動廚房，答覆是再度拒絕，請求裝置自來水管，拒絕，請求置暖爐，依然拒絕！</p>
<p>還有幾件事要說。</p>
<p>昨晚，一個受傷了的母親，在戶外露天睡了，懷中緊抱着她的嬰孩，將近天明的時候，非常寒冷，母親醒來，發覺懷裏的愛兒已經凍死了。</p>
<p>一架救護車裝了幾個傷勢極重的士兵到（Perpiguan）各個醫院都走過了，沒有一家肯收，只好又載回來石　，但是其中兩個已受不了，車子來回劇烈的　動而了。</p>
<p>就是死屍也沒有安放的地方，今天早有我看見二具屍體在鐵路旁邊，臥在舁床上，浸在污水中，和傷兵們出來呼吸新鮮空氣的地方櫂近。英雄的屍體。届然放在污水中，這是何等的罪惡！</p>
<p>還有一件事，那便是在倍比康（Perpigiuan），有人替佛朗哥招兵，在那裏，難民及傷兵一到境，都要受檢查，一進室內，立刻有人問你：『你願意回到佛期哥那裏嗎？』於是，不再說別的地方，便交給你一張寫明願意回到叛軍區域去的志願書！</p>
<p>用這種强迫方法，在一天之內，五千難民中，居然也驅得了八百個願意（？）囘到叛軍方面去的人。</p>
<p>願意回到政府軍方而云的人有一張黃卡片，到判軍方面云的是一張綠卡片。我僅見一位婦人帶着四個小孩，手裏都拿黃卡片，我問這是什麼意思？她加答道：『這嗎，這是到奈格林那邊云的！』同時她疲乏的臉上，露出一絲笑容。</p>
<p>有些難民聲明情願自殺，不願弗朗哥那邊去：『到那邊，是去做奴隸嗎？苦死嗎？』</p>
<p>同時康帶（Hendaye）方面的消息，說一列裝載西班牙兵士囘到佛朋哥那邊去的火車，駛進Bayonne附近,（Mousserolle）隧道的時候,因為慢軍，有十五個兵士跳車走了，這還不够顯示西班牙人民的眞意嗎？（Geonges　Beauhofs)</p>
<h3>蘇聯對英談判態度</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>

<p>【海通社東京十九日電】日本各界人士、得聆英法美三國聯合派軍在鼓浪嶼登陸、為之震動、昨晚此間報紙、均著論批評、多謂三國此舉、含有反日意味、但日本不欲將事件擴大、而朝日新聞則謂此事有擴大之虞、但結果如何、則該報未有談及、</p>
<p>【路透社東京十九日電】外務省發言人今日宣稱、鼓浪嶼外僑未有被登陸之日海軍陸戰隊損傷者、唯外國報紙載有與此相反之消息、英美法採取共同行動、集中戰艦、派遣水兵登陸、實可悲痛、因各該國等採取此項行動之理由、乃日海軍陸戰隊在鼓浪嶼搜查外僑、但事實上、日方並無此舉、亦無任何外人為日軍損傷也、上年日軍曾在鼓浪嶼巡邏兩月、外國戰艦並未派兵登陸、而日方亦未接獲任何外國之照會或抗議也、</p>
<h3>全國生產會議宣言（三）</h3>
<p>礦業</p>
<p>發展生產復次，請言礦業。發展礦業，以資增進後方生產，充實國家財源，實屬目前之要圖。西南西北各省礦產，其興國防軍需或民生工業有關者，如川康陝甘浙滇黔等省之煤鐵油及銅鋅之屬；其興國際貿易或外匯有關者，如康靑川陝豫鄂浙贛粵桂等省之金錫鎗銻水銀之屬。分佈旣廣。蘊蔽亦富，且時有新鑛發現，亟應充分開闢。今後對于西南西北各省未開之礦產，應積極探勘，擇尤開採，設廠冶煉。其已開各礦產及已設各煉廠，無論新式舊法，應加緊提倡指導，維護調整，擴充改良，務期以可能經費，于最近時期。獲得極大之效果。至採探新礦，或擴充改良及遷移煉廠等經費，如感不敷應用，應由政府撥欵協助，使國營民營各礦，同時發展，庶抗戰建國之資源，不虞竭蹶。而國營之礦，則當注重在中央與省府合作，此其一。</p>
<p>運銷辦法</p>
<p>以言礦產運銷，就種類區別之，有外銷與自給之別。凡維持外匯及發展國際貿易各礦產，對於建築或改善國際鐵路，以利出口，固極重要：而供給國內工業與軍需之各鑛產，對於國內鐵路支線，亦應就主要鑛產地方，提前興幹線聯絡，使增加運輸力量，减少運輸費用與時日，庶幾各種重要鑛產之製煉，可以漸次達到供求相應之目的。至鑛產之應受國家統制者，當由中央統籌管理，凡各省原訂有特別統制辦法，自應取消，俾收一致之效，此其二。</p>
<p>人材培養以言鑛業人才之培植，國內各大學鑛冶學系，應使學理與習實兼重，除採鑛冶金，應使分派各大鑛場及各煉廠實習外，對於選鑛一門，尤應增加設備，使學員隨時實習，以為應用之資，俾各種混產鑛石，得以悉數區分利用，增加效率。此外各礦廠監工及工人之訓練，亦應特加注意，此其三。</p>
<p>行政法令以言鐵業行政，就目前國內鑛業情形觀之，已較前漸趨一致。但各省主管官署，尚應力求統一簡捷，督促鑛產增加，不特須增加測繪隊，予人民以承領鑛權便利，且應厲行鑛法，對於已領部照而尚未施工或停工各鑛，嚴加取締，以免虛佔鑛區，妨礙生產。對於人民呈請領區，久未復勘各鑛，應督飭限期勘查，轉部給照，以便商民，而利生產。除政府現已頒行有限領辦煤金兩鑛變通辦法外，其從前由各省主管官署臨時核准開採之擴，應一律呈換部照，以期鞏固擴權。私採之舊有土鑛，應　諭其限期，依法設權，以免影響整個鑛業，此其四以上四端，均為中央政府及地方政府，對子鑛業生產亟應舉辦之事，所宜切實施行，以利鑛政者也。農林工鑛四者之開發與建設，同人等旣已陳其概要，然苟無完備而價廉之交通運輸，則產量雖增，運銷不暢，不惟無補於軍需之供給，且有壅塞潰决之　也。蓋生產事業，必賴交通運輸，以資暢流，而後可以調節需供，交易有無，以日趨于發展繁榮之境地。况在抗戰時期，國防所需之基本資源。對外輸出之大量物產，莫不以交通運輸為命脈。而西南西北，地區遼闊，山嶺綿亘，僅恃公路運輸，不惟緩不濟急，又且過於浪費，新築之國際交通鐵路，旣非短時期所節完工，若不別圖補救，前途將日趨艱難。今日之談西南經濟建設者，多偏重于救濟目前商業上之痛苦，而忽于運輸之研究，故有供求不相應之弊：為今之計，必須調整全部運輸物產而統籌之，對于各種物產之數量，運輸之能力，工料之多寡，及原動力之有無，加以調劑，而後始可推動產運銷存之全部工作。吾人以為今日之交通建設，除西南西北之國際交通線，應斟酌辦理外，救時之要：第一應為輕便鐵路之興築，標準鐵路雖有其優點，但費用太高，需時太久，未若輕便鐵路之速成，價廉而易于普遍，故建議政府從速籌備輕便鐵路之建築，應列為陸上運輸工具之主體；第二為現有公路之整理，如坡度之削减，路基之改良，橋樑之加强，及渡船之添設，皆為今日交通改良之要務。義者或以興工需費為難，而不知在今日公路惡劣狀况之下，每年汽車之損壞，以億萬元計，可以整理全國公路而有餘也。第三為人力畜力之應用，公路整理之後，新式改良之馬車，可以通行無阻，利用吾國自產之木材以造車，利用吾人自畜之騾馬以運輸，不惟價廉工省，卽因汽油節省而减少之外匯負担，亦將不可勝計也。第四，其可為水運之疏導，西南各省，川渠縱橫。多富舟楫之利。稍加疏導導多可行舟，因山伐木，沿河造船，一舟之量。超趕　車，不惟便利軍運，亦且可暢貨流。國產交通工具之改良，難較笨拙　而實可塞到外之漏巵，與增加運輸之便利。凡此四項建議，皆屬輕而易舉之事，若能逐步推行，不惟可以利軍運，更可以助長生產建設之發展也。（未完）</p>

<h3>英國新牒文　已送交莫斯科　勞合喬治等激昂陳詞　法盼英蘇速成立協定</h3>

<p>【海通社巴黎十八日電】據此間政界人士宣稱、英國之新牒文已於本日下午送出、國英之牒文乃根據於法國之原計劃、表示蘇聯如因援助英法所保證之國家、而引入戰爭時、英法即加以援助、換言之、卽蘇聯如因援助波蘭與羅馬尼亞而漩入戰爭、英法當卽加以援助、</p>
<p>【海通社巴黎十八日電】在英國對蘇覆牒尚未送出以前、正在進行外交折衝、蘇大使邁斯基曾數次往訪英外部、訪問畢囘抵使館時、即以長途電話與莫斯科方面商談、此間報界、尤其是『急進報』、咸希望英、蘇協定可於最近期間成立、相信張伯倫於明日下午下議院開會時、當可提出具體報告、據該報之意見、英國不欲在目下之情勢下多所負擔、是以不願公開成立軍事協定、以免包圍軸心國家之理論、更有所根據、『。急進報』更謂、法國曾促請英國從速與蘇成立協定、『巴黎晚報』否認外部曾提出一折衷辦法、並謂如在國聯開會時仍無任何成效、則哈立法克斯或將赴莫斯科一行云、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十九日電】勞合喬治今日在下院提出外交事件辯論發表激昂演說、述及獨栽國家之下次行動、渠謂、「獨裁國家現時之準備、為以往所無者、至堪注意、其目的乃在挫敗吾人也、吾人如欲獲得和平、以代巷戰爭、則唯有準備軍力、以應付緊急事變、並與各國合作、共拒侵略耳、關於蘇聯、若午方面不願與之接近、但吾人已向波蘭及羅馬尼亞提出保證、何不迅速决定與蘇締結協定、一如與法成立協定然耶了」反對黨領袖阿德里認為、勞合喬治已將現時世界情勢、作一幽暗而眞實之陳述、阿德里氏認為、現時英國尚無建設性之和平努力、而僅等候下次之侵畧行動、幷謂、「吾人必須認識軸心國家之侵略政策、歐洲現有武裝之暴徒、準備向任何人提出勒索也云」云、</p>
<p>張伯倫講述　項外交政策</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十九日電】本日下院辯論外交政策時、張伯倫（見圖）首相繼阿德里之後、在羣衆歡呼聲中、起立發言、首謂、渠本不願於今日論及外交問題、因目下正為一緊張急切而多慮之時期也、渠深知渠之一言一語、不但諸議員得以聆之、同時全世界亦可得而聞之、加以縝密之研究、「固有若干方面之人士、心懷叵測、專在言詞之中、吹毛求疵、因此或將歪曲今之所言者、而產生誤會之意義、阿德里君曾言需要長期之和平政策、其中殖民問題、亦屬一部、吾人在此國家之中、幷無意以讓步之代價以購買和平、因此反足以引起無窮之要求也、然此幷非表示吾人拒絕與他國進行討論滿足他國情緒之任何方法、卽令該項方法、僑修改目下旣成之情勢者、吾人固亦願加以討論也、如此項方法能保證在良好空氣中、加以討論、則問題或可獲得容易之解决、談判之時、如無特殊困難、或可有　多之讓步、但此種讓步之獲得、必需用於其所巳允諾者、而不可以之侵及他人之自由、非至吾人完全滿意、對方巳放棄侵略他人企圖後、吾人實難討論和平之最後條件也、</p>
<p>德政府行動與保證予盾</p>
<p>德國政府已宣稱、其幷無便略之意、但不幸者、乃反對渠者不敢置信、累累皆是、而此種不敢置信之態度、亦正德國政府所自召來（歡呼）、如吾人確知對方業已放棄侵略之企圖、而無意在德國興各國之間、應用武力、余信吾人之將不長縮、而說明吾人對討論永久和平所具之觀點及路線也、美國最大之願望、即為維持和平、此應以國際之精神加以篤信、英國之願望、唯有各種需要、均能加以衡的、方能獲得最佳之完成、此即各國之要求與權利均應加以顧及、然後吾人方可論及如何建立永久和平之路線」、論及勞合喬治之演說、張伯倫謂渠未忽視地地位之嚴重、但勞合喬治君實描學過份耳、對於捷京英使館撤退問題、實無可異而值得駭怪者、言及准許捷克財產外運、實足有助於德國之說、張伯倫謂、「余實不知德國政府是否知悉、其行動已引起全世界重大之反響、余信、德政府之行動與其屢次所予世界之保證、完全矛盾、實較其併合他人、尤引起世界人士之不安也此種矛盾、乃使安全之意識完全消燬、同時復造一成廣泛的感覺、以為任何小國一旦為德國之野心所垂注、必難保全其獨立、故吾人愈覺今日而不能引用若千奠定時局之新要素、則一大部分之歐洲大陸形將解體、英政府有鑒於此、乃覺應卽與法携手、出而干涉、設並法提供上述奠定時局之要素、德國實行侵略之威脅、頗為尖銳、故吾人有迅速行勸之必要、顧吾人向波蘭與十耳其所提出之保證、尚非為吾人擘劃中的對策之最後目標、此種保證莫非為避免時局益形惡化而提出、似可稱之為『救急辦法』也、換言之、吾人應更進一步、而擘劃史有永久性的對策、使上保證之力量益為強化、幷設法向情願貢献助力之其他強國、加以援手、雖然、余猶願有所密白者、卽吾人之政策、並無使歐洲各國形成敵對的集團之意味、蓋此種集團之所以形成、乃受彼此間的『惡感』之煽動、且以為戰禍之來無可倖免耳、余在戰爭尚未爆發以前、總不覺戰禍乃　無可倖免者、且正因時局愈黯淡、戰禍愈緊逼、而愈覺有努力弭戰之必要、吾人以為任何政策、如欲以造成敵對的集團為目的、則其本質卽不安定、故根本帶有危險、至於吾人今日所遵循之政策、旣無侵略之成分、且决不拒絕國際間本親善精神、商討一切異議之機會、此乃一種戒備的政策、非在某種場合之下、必不實行、</p>
<p>對強暴侵略　必防止發生</p>
<p>而所謂某種場合者、究竟實現與否、其權乃操於他國之手也、是卽謂吾人之政策、厥在預防強暴的侵略行為、侵略行為、或不至於發生、吾人且希望其永不發生也、此為必須之政策、若無此種政策、吾人不能獲致歐洲之平穩、工商企業均將　受影響、而人民之生活狀况亦不能加以改善矣、吾人巳向若干國家提供保證、然此尚嫌不足、吾人竭願他國加入、共助此等國家、故吾人與蘇聯及土耳其有所談判也、關於英、土談判事、英土政府迅速表示利益與意見之類同、故能於五月十二日成立宣言、此項宣主獲得熱烈之歡迎、足以表示土耳其之榮譽及其友誼之可貴、英、土友誼在凱末爾大總統時代業經開始、而在現時大總統之下、此種友誼史日益增進也、</p>

<h3>滬租界形勢突緊</h3>
<p>據今日各報消息，上海租界形勢突趨緊張租界當局業已實施特別戒嚴，各國駐軍，警察，商團等全部動員，街頭巷尾觸目盡是制服，槍械，鐵絲網，完全陷入戰時狀態。</p>
<p>上海形勢之緊張，其根本原因，衹在日方之準備實行武裝××。而前昨兩日之開始突趨空前緊張，則表明了租界當局之不甘舉所有權益以拱手續予日方。租界當局之採取緊急步驟，自興英美法水兵之在鼓浪嶼登陸有同樣意義，卽是明白警告日方：『凡事切勿過分，英美法各國决不輕易退出遠東！』</p>
<p>然而，我們對於上海，仍如對鼓浪嶼事件以至天津漢口情形一樣，覺得前途至難樂觀。第一是因為×之企圖攫取上海漢口天津租界以至其他歐洲列強在遠東勢力與權益的根據地，不僅為其整個侵略計劃的一部份，而且是目前補救與挽回其侵華之覆轍所迫急需要，因此，如果不遭受歐美列強之有效的打擊，則日×的騷擾××××行為，决不能「適可而止」！一切盧聲恫嚇，更是日×自豪的憤技，自然更不會嚇退日×！第二，目前歐美民主和平各國所取制日步驟，顯然還不够緊強。而租界當局今日所用對策，尤其如越權查禁譯報，文匯，大美，中美等援華各報，及實行反日份子大檢舉等，雖可說是避免日方藉口挑起更大事端，但是日方旣在尋隙啓景，則何患無口可藉？不從公理正義與租界條例法令去維持治安，而竟徇日方苛求以自越法例，則不僅自毀立場，抑且更授日×以可乘之隙，將來凡居住租界的華人，皆可被指爲反日或赤化，縱驅盡華人，亦仍可指西人為援華為反日為赤化，未來禍患又豈堪設想？</p>
<p>所以我們認為，為了阻止日×之進一步的實行武裝××與霸佔，則今日英美法水兵之在鼓浪嶼登陸以至上海租界當局之採取戰事戒備，作為對日示威，這是千應萬該的，相信我們居留上海以至其他各地租界的同胞，亦必樂於接受種種約束以觀英美法等民主和平友邦之示威的，然而假如祇於此種示威，而沒有進一步的有效的對日制栽，甚至在此種示威中予一切反日×反侵略勢力以重大壓迫，則不僅不能制止日×之進一步×××，甚且可以更加助長日×的勢焰！因此我們今日的任務，就在加緊一切外交活動，推進英美法等民主和平各國，萬勿放通最後時機，加緊本身的團結，加緊援華制日步驟，否則中國所失者不過如此，而歐美民主和平友邦則將不得不全部被迫退出遠東了；此外，××××××××，更應以上海及鼓浪嶼為殷鑒，加緊嚴肅起來，緊張起來，拋棄荒淫腐敗的行為，積極推進囘國服務及援助祖國的一切工作！時危勢迫，勿再做夢！</p>

<h3>繼續發揚先烈的鬥爭精神　『黃花崗』今晚重演　全港影劇界慶祝歐陽予倩先生五十壽辰</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>創造中華民國的「黃花崗」精神應該發揚光大；轟動全港的「黃花崗」公演亦再來一次—</p>
<p>時間：是今天和明天；</p>
<p>地址：是九龍普慶戲院。</p>
<p>為什麽要公演「黃花崗」呢？</p>
<p>第一，發揚為民族解放而奮鬥犧牲的精神；</p>
<p>第二，為賑聯會籌款撫恤抗戰陣亡將士及家屬，　慰先烈於九泉之　；</p>
<p>第三，鞏固及發揚本港話劇界空前大團結的精神。</p>
<p>今次重演『黃花崗』的意義除類同上次的三點之外，還有新的意義存在着</p>
<p>第一，上次公演「黃花崗」是成功的，這偉大的牧獲應該加以廣播；</p>
<p>第二，搬到九龍去，以期普遍。讓革命思想與革命行動，在每個角落發生起來。</p>
<p>第三，是本港話劇界慶祝戲劇導師歐陽予倩先生五十壽辰的献禮。</p>
<p>——這樣看來，今次公演。『黃花崗』的意義是比上次來得更加深刻了。</p>
<p>歐　予倩先生的壽辰何以　得慶祝呢？因為歐陽先生是中國戲劇界的拓荒者，數十年如一日的奮鬥精神，在是實　得　揚與　傲，抗戰以後，他在救亡　劇和國防雷影方面，尤不小的力量，對這一位老而益壯的藝衛前衛，我們是應該給他以安慰與勉勵。</p>
<p>除了戲劇界至誠為歐陽先生祝壽，並致無限希望之外，昨晚中華藝術劇團特設宴慶祝。　請本港文化界，電影界戲劇界，參加者二百餘人，融融樂樂熱鬧一時，中國電影製片廠，還派員前往攝製新聞片，至深夜一時始盡歡而散。今晚八時起在普慶戲院聯合義演『黃花崗』以為慶祝，票價是分為二毫，五毫，一元，雨元，以求普遍。到場歌詠團體，有中華業餘合唱團，國鋒號歌詠隊，中華書局歌詠隊，四婦女宣訓班歌詠隊等，希望港九僑胞，別錯過這個難得的機會，同時本港中央放映『小玲子』，國泰放映『桃花扇』，彌敦汝映『木蘭從軍』等名片，以資助慶，所有收入獻由歐陽先生轉献各界賑聯曾，以上各片，都是歐陽先生的傑作，由華成及華盛公司報效片租，中央，國泰，彌　院報効院租，這亦未始不是本港的創畢</p>
<p>——這樣的祝壽，是影劇界　有的表示，是十分有意義的盛舉。趁着今天歐陽先生的舞辰，我們除同歐陽先生謹致民族最敬禮，並祝他永遠靑春外，亟應站在報人的立場，提供一些意見，作為祝壽的禮物：</p>
<p>一，戲劇界的統一戰綫興共同發展，是當前迫切的任務，縱有人未立共信，未生互信，這是在所不免的過渡現象，希望歐陽先生再接再厲，善加領導起來</p>
<p>二，希望『中藝』，在歐陽先生領導之下，除救亡劇遝外，更多徵有意義的其他的救亡工作，當必有更偉大的成功，有更偉大的效果。「我們連吃飯，戀愛，都與×人的侵路有關係」。魯迅先生這樣的說法，在我們共同的體驗中一點亦沒有錯誤。</p>
<p>三，從多年訓練出來的中藝團員在演技方面相當高明，希望歐陽先生領導共百尺竿頭再進一步，在各方面更充實更堅強地，負起更偉大的時代任務。十</p>

<h3>南華歌詠班</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>第三屆昨晚又誕生</p>
<p>「起來！不願做奴隸的人們。」中華民族的吼聲，　遍每一個角落，激發了每一個頹廢的人們！歌聲，雄壯的歌聲，儼然是前方將士手中的决槍，是一　犀利的武器。香港，南華體育會游藝部的負責人，在艱難困苦當中，創立了一個救亡的歌詠班，集合着幾百個優秀的靑年，用他們的武器——歌詠，打　×人漢好的無恥佼倆。現在這個歌詠班已生長到第三周歲了，在第一屆開始的時候，人數雖然祇有百幾人，可是在大家苦幹下之不新訓練，成績非常優異，曾經先後參加各慈善籌欵公開演唱，獲得極優美的批評。所以到第二屆已增加三百幾人，情况更形熱烈了。</p>
<p>昨天，是歌詠班第三屆誕生之夜，在寬寬的一只堂子當中，緊攏起一班活潑的靑年，談談說說全堂都充滿了愴快的笑意。銀哨子一響，大家都肅靜歸座，莊嚴的國歌，　溢四座，主席簡單的報告這個歌詠班的歷史，跟着來一個輕鬆的介紹禮，主席，幹事……一個一個的靑年笑嘻嘻的跑上臺上，來一個九十度的鞠躬，向大家行一個見面禮。接若雄壯的歌聲又起來了。廣州抗×動員會的指導員鄭國屏先生帶笑登場，來一篇嚴　的訓話，跟着歌聲又起了</p>
<p>參加了南華歌詠的開學禮，我們深感到歌聲的偉大，更感到這個歌詠班負責人的可佩，不過，創業維難，在香港這個地方，而訓練一班遠離火綫的靑年，這當然是一件艱鉅的工作，所以大家應該怎樣努力苦幹，把一切因難克服過來啊！</p>

<h3>「死城」四日經歷記</h3>
<p>本港南華早報代表最近由港赴廣州、居留『死城』四日、歸來寫成「死城』四日經歷記、在該報發表、對於×軍佔領下之廣州荒凉市態、紊亂之金融現狀、及盜賊如毛之黑暗世界、均有確實之報告、×軍之宣傳廣州經己恢復繁榮之荒謬、凡曾到廣州者、皆能予以斥證、而×軍企圖吸引民衆返市之陰謀、實難得逞、淪陷後之廣州眞面目、讀該文卽可窺見一斑、</p>
<p>該文首述作者由澳抵廣州之經過、及所得之印象、謂抵廣州、從碼頭乘人力車赴沙面途中、得以瀏覽劫後廣州之面目、第一印象、即使人憶起報章上所載廣州大火之紀述、頹垣斷壁、景象悽凉、大建築物鮮有不毀於火者、堤邊較為繁盛、多數街道　寂無人、公共汽車及自用汽車、皆為罕見之物、馳聘道上者、盡為日本軍車、往來遝輸、忙個不了、街道交叉點、輙有日軍多人、聯羣結隊、搜查行人、每隔數百碼、則有日兵一人姑崗、刁斗森嚴、途人辟易、沙面亦受影響、商業異常冷淡、商店雖照常營業、但店員則巳大事裁減、域多利酒店門堪羅雀、住客僅作者及其旅伴二人、沙面外僑人　銳減、原有數百人、現僅五十人而已、物價與香港無異、惟胖菓蔬菜、則價格奇昂　廣州市內舶來品絕市、商店所售者、靈屬日貨、市內商店多為日人所經營、廣州巳成為日貨傾銷市場矣、</p>
<p>廣州金融極為紊亂、日軍勒令市民使用日本軍用票、禁止法幣流通、然而市民多樂用法幣、故法幣仍流通於市面、但日人經營之商店及酒家、則拒用之、廣州巳成死市、觸目盡屬荒凉、市民返市者寥寥無幾、廣州現有人口之確實數字、殊難肯定、據沙面某商人估計、約五十萬、但另一位之估計、則為一萬五千、據一位日本商人之估計、亦謂最多不過二十萬、以作者之觀察、廣州現有人口大約十萬、多屬貧苦階級、商人雖有一度返市者、但稍留卽復　開、蓋由於地方不靖盜賊如毛、且商場冷淡、無可經營、稍為富有者皆不願留居死城以受驚擾、因市面不靖、入夜卽宣佈戒嚴、其實不論日夜、日軍皆嚴為警銜、市內日軍約一萬人、至於市郊附近、究否發生戰事、殊難探悉、據某日本軍官語作者稱、廣州附近三十里內巳無戰事、惟一二日前、沙面仍聞淸晰砲聲、作者居留廣州時、常見日本軍車載大批日傷兵返市云、</p>
<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>攝製新片「獨裁者」卓別麟接獲恐嚇信　僱用特別衛士輪流保證　決不動搖初衷努力進行</h3>
<p>銀幕喜劇巨匠卓別麟的開口新片「獨裁者」、內容誰鄒知道是諷刺某獨裁者的、他把目前世界政局中的某種野蠻與不合理的政治現象、強調了它底愚蠢性與可笑性、以喜劇的形式搬上銀幕</p>
<p>在全世界的觀衆之前給以無精的打擊、這當然會使被諷刺的某一種人感到憤怒與威脅的、因之向卓別麟使出了他們一貫的無賴手段——恐嚇——謀害、</p>
<p>「獨裁者」己經開拍了了、目前正在積極的攝製中、可是自從這張片子决定開拍以後、卓別麟先後接到了無數的恐嚇信、內容大都是說「獨裁者」一片含有「侮蔑』意味、迫令立卽停止攝製、否則將以恐怖手段、把卓氏『置之死地』云云、卓別麟為防止遭人毒手起見最近巳僱用了一個貼身的武裝衛士畫夜保護、他的一日三餐、在烹調的時候、並派了特別偵探在旁監視、以防好人下毒謀害。同時、在攝製該片的時候、攝影場四周也有戒備、情况相當嚴重。但據說卓別麟雖然受了暴徒們的恐怖的威脅、他的初衷絕無絲毫動搖、反之、「獨栽者』的攝製工作、目前正積極加緊努力、日夜進行、以期在最短期間、『此可笑之喜劇、得呈於全世界開頭人士之前』、按好萊塢影人受到這樣嚴重的戒備、彷彿政界要人那樣、在電影史上尚屬創見、</p>
<h3>好萊塢影星代表作</h3>
<p>— 續</p>
<p>史本山屈萊賽以「怒海餘生」言、則較「孤兒　　」（此片尚未來港公映）尤強、因史本山飾一歡父、猶嫌其個性或不甚適合也、</p>
<p>洛勃脫楊　常亦以『生死同心』一片推為洛勃脫之代表作、</p>
<p>爾遜埃迪　遜爾遜與珍尼麥唐娜合作之下、允以『鳳凰于飛』一片為最精彩、</p>
<p>赫勃馬歇爾　赫勃之『緣窗春困』、亦為新人茜蒙茜蒙之最佳作、</p>
<p>李却葛林李却之『濟艇驅逐隊』與『四傑傳』實勝過『冰雪　鴻』『香姝寶馬』等、</p>
<p>狄克鮑惠爾　狄克之作品、難分軒　、如嚴格比較、則以與愛　絲費曼黛琳卡活兒合演之「燕妬鶯嬌」為最生動、</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝　平之歌片、亦難比較「海外艷乘」似為最近之佳構　（未完）</p>
<p>喬治賴甫喬冶近來亦少消息。值得一提者為『怒海英魂』。</p>
<p>自理安亨純戲劇演出的『茄力克』。　屬白理安享之唯一成功作。</p>
<p>喬治亞理斯喬治或己成為退伍之演員。然『大富之家』、確為一部成功作品。</p>
<p>愛德華羅寶遜愛德華之『滿城風雨』『聲色犬馬』等均為名構。間I　An　TheLaw為生動。</p>
<p>考爾門當以『盧宮秘史』稱為代表作。設該有演藝。其結果必告失敗。</p>
<p>華納裴士德華納似與考爾之作風彿彷、最佳片為「流浪富豪」、</p>
<p>巴理穆亞　約翰與里昂昆伸、近雖都處於名片之配角地位、然演出仍獲觀衆好鉀、約翰近年號　　、以前有『慾海滄桑』『陶伯士教授』兩片、在前者約翰飾律卹、演技恰到好處、里昂之『晚宴』及近片『浮生若夢』均屬佳　。</p>
<p>李思廉霍華　這一位英國藝人，有南部最佳片。—為『紅花俠』、一為『賣花女』此片尚未在港公映、兩片皆為英國出品，在好萊塢演出之成功作，常推『鑄情』、</p>
<p>范朋克小范朋克近復振作、『盧宮秘史』中、截雖少，仍獲得佳譽、『巴黎尤物』一片亦為佳作、</p>
<p>勞勃杜奈勞勃之『醫林寶鑑』、據傳、尤勝於『基度山恩仇記』</p>
<p>却爾斯鮑育『樂園思凡』勝於『象破崙秘史』、最近之海角遊魂，元為代表之作，</p>
<p>茂文島格拉斯茂文之代表作、當推與瓊白朋黛兒合演之『偵探夫人』、『紅杏枝頭』之演出、亦屬不弱、</p>
<p>亨利方達　『同命鴛鴦』足以娩美保羅茂尼之『亡命者』、</p>
<p>維多麥克勞倫　『革命叛徒』為當然的代表作、</p>

<p>「我說過我要使她像個女公爵」、說著他興奮地拿出一個大信封來，『你們看、這是乞蘭西凡尼亞使館來的跳舞會請帖、我决定叫她充作一位公爵夫人帶她去』、</p>
<p>離開跳舞會的日子、一天天的近了、麗莉莎刻苦的學習一切舉止和談吐、終於很快的到了那一天、希金的手指搔着蓬亂的頭髮、他對愛莉莎說、「我們再來學習一次」、</p>
<p>她實在疲倦極了、用手遮了臉、失望的說、「我——不能這樣做」、</p>
<p>使館的富麗的舞廳中雖有許多值得加以興趣的事物，但是希金心不在焉的立在畢克林旁邊、因為他是不安地踏上成功和失敗的關鍵上了、正担心着結果如何、他剛才會看見一個把他的希望打消的臉面、這人現在走過來了、臉上露出笑容說、</p>
<p>「希金教授、你記得我　、我是阿力司　卡伯帝、你教過我語音　的、你能够指出一個人生在英國的那一個地方、我却能够指出生在歐洲的那一個地方、我是你的成績最好的學生啊』、</p>
<p>希金知道，那人的確和他自己有同樣的本領、那人走後、他告訴畢克林說、「如果他聽出愛莉莎來、我就完了、」</p>
<p>「我要個較好職業」、他接續說、「但是因為說話音　不對、人們不肯要我、你能戰我囑」、</p>

<h3>南華南遊足球隊今日與聯隊義賽　南華有惠堂聯隊有大告且看兩人鬥法　明天南華又與洋水兵作友誼賽</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）南華會旗下足球隊、在一九二八至二九年度的賽會裏、建下一段光前裕後的功績、眞是難能可貴、永垂不杇、</p>
<p>然其球人雖有包辦錦標之榮、仍不視此為滿足、蓋學無窮盡、勤則成功、近應南洋方面的邀請、又作遠征之舉、　於本月廿四日乘法郵船博杜美號出發了、</p>
<p>臨別在卽、尚不吝　　、該南遊隊因應該會非常時期工作服役團的邀請、於今天下午五時一刻、在加路連山與聯隊作一場義賽、此舉旣為難胞請命、復借此機會、充份練習、為南遊的準備、</p>
<p>今天的門票、分一元、六角、三角三種、但看客切莫在場外購買、因為最近有假票出現、請莫上當、</p>
<p>明天下午五時一刻、該甫游隊又約得干和路號英艦的水兵，亦在加山作友誼賽、或門票比今天較廉、</p>
<p>足球季結束後、球人多豹隱、因此、今天的聯隊陣綫、雖係　會方面負責編定、然巳先由南華會分向各員徵求同意、均允為義舉効勞、此　乃得以實現、既然他們　答允出場、相信不會臨陣退縮的、</p>
<p>聯隊陣綫、前天巳公布，看來異常完整、前綫方面、有大告山奴，侯澄滔，拖般等、都是第一流球人、攻力必然利銳、守衛方面、有谷巴、許竟成、侯容生、施漢等，亦皆知名之士、若均合力拍演、定然悅目可觀</p>
<p>南華陣綫、昨午才决定、排出煥然一新，尤其是前綫、取適合各個的位置、不再有削足就履之弊、而且、除兩翼是固定的、必要時三鋒則均可互相調位、因為三鋒左右咸宜、在任何一位置都可施展如意、此是今天前綫的特色處、</p>
<p>有人說，『沒有錦標關係的表演賽、演出總不十分繁張的』、此種情形或有之，但未必盡然、因為兩陣對圓、便成對敵地位、凡身與戰役的、當無不具有盡其所　而　已隊　取勝利的心理、尤其是雙方工力悉敵的隊伍、相爭更烈，未必因無錦標關係，便放棄其圖取勝利的目的、相信今天這兩隊正因為勢均力敵、必存各不易與的雄心、而有至多精彩的演出、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>當前學生對於體格訓練應有的革新　（三）</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>體操向來被人詆毀作呆板枯燥，運動量微小的迷動，惟自由是尚的學生，更不肯一顧，不過它有特殊的價值：難易深幾，界限分明，老少強弱都可行；左右勻稱，上下兼施，全體各部　收效；不擇時地，不限人數，隨時隨地都能行；而它最主要的特色，就是不需一個小錢，是一切運動的基本運動。</p>
<p>活滋器械操，是多數人認為動作太難而不顧做的運動，但木馬跳箱的騰越和單雙棋的脫手迴環等動作，能義成胆大心細，勇敢冒險的精神；墊上運動的　　倒立單雙積的擺動旋轉等助作，能養成　應顯　旋轉，急遽昇降的航空技術；而動作的機巧敏捷，更能養成於陷陣殺×時有得心應手，應付裕如的本領。</p>
<p>國術是我國數千年來固有的練身方法，它動作的吳妙，變化的神秘，是它獨特的功能，現在的戰爭，雖然　着飛機和大砲，但到了衝鋒肉搏，短兵相接的時候，國衛就可以大神發威，過去抗戰中，發揮國術威力以殺×的光榮戰　，眞是數不勝數。</p>
<p>軍事體育，如：登攀，　越，跳濱，爬山，滾進，以及投擲手溜彈等技術，不但在臨陣交鋒時，可以直接應用，收左右逢源，指揮自如，殺×致果之效；而且是富有天然性的運動，我們大可把它來代作田徑運。</p>
<p>上述各種運動、雖然未能網羅無遺，但巳具梗概，我們按當前所需的運動康則，衡諸各種運動的性能、就可知所擇從，。學生對體格訓練材料需要革新的所在，也可了如指掌了。</p>
<p>三，練習方法的革新：運動固能使體格牧堅強之效，而收效之能否迅速，胥以練習方法的合否為準　，練習的方法合，則不必膽前觀後，所做的工夫，絲毫不致虛　；不然，徘徊躊躇，必致徒勞無功。</p>

<h3>上海資金缺乏運用對象　國內經濟環境轉變　滬市畸形繁榮未能過份樂觀　開發西南經濟端賴交通建設　上漲銀行之年會報告</h3>
<p>上海商業備蓄銀行年會時之民國二十七年之報告云，本年度國內經濟狀况、因戰事之蔓延、遭受空前之厄運、損失之重、為我國有史以來所未有，而各地經濟、因所受戰事影響之不同、更發生種種畸形現象、就大體而、生產消費、均見衰退、至國外經濟狀况、各國因環境與政策之不同、其情况頗不一律、但不景氣之象徵，似較為普遍、茲將國內經濟狀况、分金融、貿易、物價、及工商業、各項，撮述於左、</p>
<p>金融　本年度承去秋金融恐慌之後、財政部所頒安定金融辨法，繼續施行、中中交農所　織之貼放委員會、亦陸續在各地辦理之貼放事宜、兼以政府對於法幣始終决心維持、同時英美友邦政府金融機關、亦輒相機協助、故戰局雖日趨惡化、而金融市場、迄能穩定如常、不特毫無提存風潮，卽以前逃避之資金、亦有大量之回歸，金融機關，除一二小銀行外、無倒閉情事、全年上海拆息、並無異常之變動，卽政府公債之暗市、亦盤旋上升、凡此均出我人預計之外、堪以引為欣慰、在此比較穩定之局面下、其間亦不乏重要事變、堪為我人注意者、約有數端、</p>
<p>外匯黑市　本年度開始、政府對於法定匯價、仍努力維持、嗣因環境關係，於三月十四日頒布外匯請核辦法、規定各銀行因正當用途於收付相抵後需用外匯時、得向中央銀行申請購買、經中央銀行核准後、按照法定價售與外匯、俾對於外匯之供給、酌加限制、更於六月間絡續規定限制進口貨物之種類，對於出口貨物之外匯、亦應售於國家銀行、又於八月八日規定自本年度一月一日以後裝運進口之貨物、申請外匯、除必要品外、不再接受、市場上外匯之需要、遂不能儘量滿足、所謂黑市　、應運而生，法幣之非正式匯價，自一先令二便士半絡績下降，竟達八月間之七便士八七五、但自下半年起、此項黑市場之匯率、則常盤旋於八便士以上、英美借欵成立後、尤見堅穩、具見法幣之價值、雖在黑市場操縱之下、猶能維持其相當穩定性也、</p>
<p>匯劃貼水　上海匯劃貨幣、本定隔日取現、但自財部施行安定金融辦法以後、所謂同業匯劃、即為祇能轉帳，不能兌現、並不能轉購外匯之貨幣、其用途旣受限制，如欲與現幣掉換、遂發生貼水辦法，此在上年度下半期已見端倪、本年度更變本加厲、嗣經聯合準備會出而維持、大量挹注、遂告平復、至本年度底、則市法幣籌碼、頗見增加、匯劃貼水、巳趨低落、故自戰事發生以來、上海金融市場、增加一種新籌碼，顧客與行莊往來、常須開立法幣與匯劃二戶、亦戰時金融之畸形現象也，本年度戰事逐漸西移、上海與內地之交通，日感小便、戰前及戰時，上海　往內地貨物數量頗鉅、而內地土貨、不易大量運出、且為政府所統制、自內地匯往上海之軟項、遠過於上海匯往內堆者、其匯兌率遂日超高昂、且有無處調匯之苦、此外上海與華北各埠之匯兌、亦頗為混亂、用是各地資金、不易互相挹注、則亦受戰事之影響也、</p>
<p>上海資金自戰事　京滬一帶，內地人士避難來滬者、日見衆多　戰區資金、流入甚巨、而戰前及戰時購買外匯之資金、頗有因坐耗利息而獲利囘歸者、用是上海資金、漸感充裕、金融業活期存款、增加頗巨、市場籌碼、日趨鬆動、投機事業、隨以與起、自外幣赤金股票之買賣，以至各種商品之囤積，反較戰前為繁盛，以資金運用於不生產之途徑，不能不視為戰時經濟之　憂，</p>
<p>西南金融自政府西移後、西南之經濟開發，不容或緩、本埠各大金融機關為適應內地人士之需要計、在西南各省重要地點、開設分支行者、日見衆多、戰區內之金融機關、亦多隨政府退至西南、人民資金、遂得逐漸移入、以供當地生產事業之用、目下上海之資金、旣缺少運用之對象，倘能在安全原則下、移用於內地，則有補於西南經濟開發者、當非淺鮮、凡此諸端、均為本年度戰時金融之特徵、雖未盡如人意、然吾人苟體察此次戰事之嚴重、及其蔓延區域之廣大、不得不以本年度金融狀况之平穩、為不可多得之現與、則政府之努力保障通貨、安全金融、及維護債信、象夫友邦金融機關之協力相助、均具有莫大貢戲者也、</p>

<h3>我所認識的尚仲衣博士</h3>
<p>— 莊澤宣</p>
<p>南粵不幸，慘遭蹂躪，教育家案我輩而去者先後已三人矣—三人之中獨以尚仲衣博士之死為最突兀，然三人之中又以尚君與余交為最深。余現哀輓楊果菴黃啓明二先生於前、今于尚君之死更不可無言。二十年前余出國之時，尚君猶肆業淸華中專科，余未認識之。十五年前余歸國執教鞭於淸華，尚君已將畢所業，時余兼任　業指導事，知其熱心社會服務，力勸其研求教育，尚君且　余言入批博對大學。批　對者，美國南部設佳之師範學院，盛名興哥侖比亞，芝加哥相鼎足，而中國學生前此未嘗有去者，尚君旣入，備受當　人士與校中師生之歡迎。詞尚君再　哥大師範院，得博士學位　。</p>
<p>六年前余赴杭任教浙大，而尚君則在浙長民衆教育實驗學校，造就民教師資不少。余在牯嶺遇夢麟先生，知北大需教育人才，乃徵尚君同意　。時尚君已與汪麗芳女士結婚，麗芳淸華同學　桂君之妹，留美專攻音樂，夫隨婦唱　極　眉之樂</p>
<p>一年前余　難來粵，尚君方代　載陽先生主中大教育研究所，努力提倡戰時教育。未幾裁陽先生自　考察歸國，朱有光曾昭森兩兄數宴載陽先生於嶺南招待室，余與尚君均在座，憶對某問題曾有緊張之辯論。後余握奇將軍聞尚君之名邀入政治部，尚君　夜從公，臨危不苟。廣州疏散　孺，尚君遣眷入桂，俾能專心工作。初不料廣州失守而桂林又被炸。尚君隨軍北行而尚夫人及其子女則間道來港，</p>
<p>此次尚君方擬自韶乘車　汕轉港，乃車　　順附近竟遇不測之禍，池人皆輕　，獨當君以身殉，嗚呼，何天之奪吾教育家更甚於其他工作者耶。尚君正少壯之年，叚以歲月其在教育上之專功，必不限於巳完成者。尚君對於戰時教育之貢　，我　已熟　之，他日戰後教育設施欲其領導而不可得，豈非國家民族前途之莫大損失耶！</p>
<h3>遭遇</h3>
<p>— 孫鎭石</p>
<p>一陣毒打的審問過後他給幾個身材魁梧的大漢，帶進了這黑暗的鐵牢。是那末地狹小窒息，擠滿着大羣的人衛，他一進去，就幾乎被有隻伸出着的脚所絆跌。向前摸索着，挨在人隙里坐下。他感到頭腦在拚命地膨漲，皮有上一個個毛孔在炸裂，一陣酸痛，一陣麻木，他下意識地咬緊了牙；眼珠兒漸　地模糊　暗，世界彷弗在旋轉著，終於，他暈了過去。</p>
<p>一陣劇烈的疼痛，又把他催　，望望四周，依　是一片　黑，好些聲音在低低地呻吟著，他心靈中掠過了渺茫的陰影，默默地沉落在記　　。</p>
<p>一個中午，他正要走出辦事處，突然，王仲文隊長急促地奔過來，向他輕輕說道：</p>
<p>「金剛，現在有一件事又要你去幹。假使你幹成功了，我們更能添一層力量。」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」他望望王隊長。</p>
<p>王隊長立刻把嘴　近他他的耳邊：</p>
<p>我們現在雖然有幾百個同志，可是槍械却僅僅只有三四十技。C鎭上××小學校校門前的甬道下面，埋有五十多枝短銃槍。是以前軍隊撤退時遺留下來的，現在就派你去設法運出來，至於怎樣運法，你到那里見機作事吧。」王隊長抬起頭，望了望蔚藍的天，繼續急促地說：「你今天晚上，立刻就去幹吧，好得你鎭上情形是熟悉的」。</p>
<p>於是，在暮色蒼茫的時候，他到了C鎭，寄宿在一個熟人家里。開始他的活動</p>
<p>在二星期後、他率領了一批熱情年靑的脚夫，在黑夜潛入了沒有人住的學校，展開艱困的工作。甬道旁邊的河水，在暗夜里閃動着黑亮的光。一隻漁船靜靜的等候着，催促起他們更努力的挖掘。</p>
<p>借着月亮星辰的光芒，在黑夜裏挖呀挖的，泥土挖起了幾尺高，一層畏　闊的木板發現了。說在這底下面，埋着一堆黑沉沉的槍械。無數隻的跟睛，開始透露出欣悅愉快的波光，彼此用着全力，把槍械一技枝的捆起來，向着停泊在河旁的漁船搬。在漁船上守候着的伙伴，把搬上船的槍械，裝在　裏，用布蓋遮着。</p>
<p>漁船開始在河流里流動，襯映在星月的光輝裏、市鎭的輪廊，夢般地正在酣　狀態中。</p>
<p>四周是，　　，對面送來了一陣款乃聲。不一刻，幾條強烈的電光，向這邊船上照來，暴厲的　音呼叱着：「幹什麽的？不准動！伙伴們來不又　出　伙，對方巳跳過船來，於是金剛及伙伴們，一連串的被帶進偽警察局。在審問前，就遭了駐在偽警局里的黃衣人的毒打，鮮紅的血液，從紅　的皮膚中迸發出來，變成了褐紫色狹畏的烙印，在他們身上，毒打後就被逐個帶進審判處，幾個猙獰的黃衣人和偽員們，高高地生在上面，露出蔑視的冷笑。</p>
<p>「你還不招嗎？」上面的聲昔在半空中飄起，金剛仍安詳莊重地立着，默默地在沉思。半響，審判室側門輕快地推開，一位便服的青年人，高散地定出，看見了金剛，裝作驚訝的模樣！</p>
<p>「唔，原來是金剛兄！你犯了什麽菲啊？」</p>
<p>他一抬頭，站在面前的原來是昔日的同學楊一民。</p>
<p>「金剛兄，當了游擊隊　？哈合—多無聊的勾當—</p>
<p>無數的火星，在金剛眼中迸射，他不等楊一民說完，就一鼓作氣向他撲去，揚一民冷不防被他搜了個跟斗</p>
<p>此後金剛就被幾個彪彤大漢拖下去毒打，暈去醒來，醒來再暈去，暈暈醒醒，一好幾次。渾身部是紅　的皮膚。就這樣被他們推進了這鐵牢。</p>
<p>他懷念着年靑的脚夫，船夫，又懷念着他的許多同志們。就這樣地他在牢獄中挨，苦難的磨　，等待機會來時，破壁飛去。</p>
<h3>天曙</h3>
<p>— 馬御風</p>
<p>農家慣早起，</p>
<p>天祗有一點微明，</p>
<p>廊上便有人走動，</p>
<p>繼而是開啟門的的聲音。</p>
<p>母親廚中生火</p>
<p>又咐　妹妹，</p>
<p>挑桶巡視圓團，</p>
<p>戶外一片濛濛。</p>
<h3>俘虜</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>下弦　掛在府頭上，一程一程的送着我們、當太陽出來的時候，巳經定了廿里了。</p>
<p>沿途都是×軍經過的地方，汾水西岸的各村莊里，個人影子都沒有了，</p>
<p>再也看不見晨起的炊烟了，心上感到一連荒凉。</p>
<p>狗，徘徊在路旁，舐着地面的血。遠遠望見公路曲折地從山上下來。頭上佈滿了我們警戒的部隊。</p>
<p>拍！拍！拍！連接響了。</p>
<p>當我們通過公路的時候，從公路旁邊的村子裏，四個敵人向公路這邊定過來。</p>
<p>我們迎着上去，快槍嘹亮的叫了一下，一個日本兵倒下來了。</p>
<p>「數槍，不殺，優待你們！」宣傳員用日語喊着口號，我們的行列繼續前進着</p>
<p>另外三個日本兵，向前面的村子跑去。跟在後面緊追着的我們戰士，也用日語喊話了。</p>
<p>我們是八路軍，優待俘虜。</p>
<p>三個活的日本兵，被解除武裝了。</p>
<p>我問他們：「你們為什麽會受法西斯軍閥的欺騙，到中國來當炮灰。」</p>
<p>他們長久地低着頭，不做聲，</p>
<p>忽然有一個說話了，聲音有點激動。</p>
<p>「我們是為東亞和平而戰，不是為侵略而戰。」</p>
<p>我又：</p>
<p>「為和平而戰，為什麽到中國來，強佔中國的土地，殘殺中國的人民，　　中國的婦女，……</p>
<p>他說：「因為中國不能諒解。」</p>
<p>我有點氣了，問道：</p>
<p>「成們諒解什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我也不知道本國為政者是何意見。」</p>
<p>政治員把我們的主張張告訴他們了。他說：「我們並不仇視日本的國民，我們只要　到日本法西斯軍閥；大部份的日本人和我們一樣</p>
<p>都在受害。我們——中國人和日本人，應該聯合起來</p>
<p>打擊法西斯　　，解除我們自身的痛苦。</p>
<p>他們對政治員的談話，表示了贊同</p>
<p>那位政治員的態度，那樣誠懇，眞摯，眞能感人</p>
<p>後來又對他們說：「　如你們到中國來，不但永遠囘不去，家里的父母妻子遺天天念着：到中國來，你們是沒有好處的」！</p>
<p>「就是家中想我等也要想死啊」！</p>
<p>三個異邦人的眼淚出來了。</p>
<p>南關的一炮聲很猛烈；于是我們那位政治員帶了一營人到光九谷桃花坡之間公路兩旁的山中去了。準備截　　的汽車隊。</p>
<h3>孤獨的散步</h3>
<p>— 牆頭草</p>
<p>我一向很喜歡散步，說喜歡，　並不是一般衛生家所認為這是有益身心運動的緣故。實在，為了時間太空閑；一高興就隨便走走，慢慢地終於成了習慣。人一到習慣的時候，往往會不自覺地自動地做去的。在我，就步就是一個很好的例子，</p>
<p>我底散步的時間　以深夜居多，因為在白天，街上的車輛校多，人羣也比較擠。車輛過處，揚起沙塵，直向鼻里　里　來，會感到難以呼吸。在深夜，——黃昏也好——軍　也稀少了，人羣也冷落了，這樣就可以較自由地來去閒步，不致於撞了人家的肩膀，或人家錢　了自己的鞋子，　得閑散的心情焦躁不安，而違背了散步的原童、</p>
<p>我不喜歡有多人合俘的散步，因為它所具有的趣味再不是基於散步的。卽以很小的一點而論，各人的脚步不一致，就可以在心靈上生出很多的麻煩來。然而，我却喜歡有兩個人一起的散步，咻對方是真正會領受散步的情趣的。不過，事實上我時常是孤獨的，我就只我一個自已。</p>
<p>因此我笑自己是一個孤獨的飲步者。</p>
<p>了有太多的散步，我熟習太多的適宜於散步的街道，多半是比較冷靜的但並不荒僻。我在上面走得很慢，嘴里老是吟　着像詩人生苦簿一篇傑作似的。其實，我有待什麽也不想去。對於身旁的事物絕不注意；或有所感，有所覺。我以為自己是屬于另一個世界里的，同時也以為　個的世界是專屬於我的。但當我悟到此身原在人間，在平常忽忙中忽略去過的事物？我冷靜地要強調自已的觀察　發覺出其中的趣味來，我就會停留有眩人的霓紅光刺眼的　窗下，移動着目光，默默地享受看種種貨品的色樣。搆造的美趣。我會跟隨富有風韻的女性的背後，來滿足我感覺上的舒服。是的，我也感覺這樣的無聯，因此我常常急需要想遇到一個熟人。卽使是淡淡地見過面的也也，我會給予招呼，投一下喜悅的目光，自然我更需要有窺切的重握，傾訴的談吐，我底心靈會因此而温緩。</p>
<p>但街道猶如海洋，在浩渺的海洋里，我和人羣陌生的。</p>
<p>夜巳深沉，人們已入　鄉　這街上就祇有我自已。</p>
<p>望望天上的星長。我在若有所得若有所失地思索，像一個哲人竭力要了解宇宙秘密似的。</p>
<p>朋友，你要問我，思索些什麽呢？</p>
<p>我告訴你，我懷念着郊外，如果郊外作一個孤獨的教步，那多好，我要　向郊外去，</p>
<h3>滿地的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>女俟一見他，立刻閉主　；抖索起來：她像是燃起的　燭，漸潮地溶化下來。她不敢說話，詆給那個偵探一些暗示，好像說：</p>
<p>「那個傢伙，就是土匪！」</p>
<p>於是，那個偵探立　掏出手槍來，監視住雨文。這時候，女侯慢慢地，摟抱過朱　來，敢說話了：</p>
<p>『你看不就是他嗎？』</p>
<p>朱琳是聰明的。地說：</p>
<p>『你發瘋啦，他不是才和我同來的嗎？你沒看見他嗎？』</p>
<p>『我看是看見啦！可是現在我才看出他來！小姐，我記得他的眼睛，你看不對喝？』</p>
<p>『不要胡說！』</p>

<h3>The Anguish of Wartime Youth</h3>
<p>Recently, I have frequently received letters from young people in various regions pouring out their anguish. From these letters, one can see the various contradictory phenomena occurring in the current stage of the War of Resistance as it enters a new period of hardship: for example, on the one hand, the government and other military, economic, and diplomatic institutions are experiencing a severe 'talent famine', while on the other hand, there are still thousands upon thousands of specialized talents and outstanding young cadres shouting from all directions, 'No way to serve the country'; on the one hand, war zones, occupied areas, and various regions in the rear urgently need young people from all over, especially overseas Chinese, to return to the country and their hometowns to serve, while on the other hand, many members of service groups are experiencing the tragic lament of 'difficult work, running into walls everywhere', and many young people are becoming pessimistic and disappointed about the future of the War of Resistance as a result. Yesterday, a young man who had returned to his hometown to serve sent a letter from the area of ××, in which he said: 'These hardworking and resilient young people are regarded as landmines in Eastern Europe, as if they will explode immediately if they are not cleared away. In this way, pointless friction occurs! Fortunately, the other party still understands the greater good and the matter was settled peacefully. But... this kind of friction is not limited to one place or one time, and there is a possibility of it continuing to develop. Therefore, I can't help but feel chilled to the bone, and I can't help but re-evaluate the future of the War of Resistance, and my own ideological problems have arisen... Therefore, I am eager to leave.' Another young man from a service group sent a letter from the area of ××, in which he said: 'There is no political ideal here, and no passion to fight for the nation and the country. A bunch of nondescript people have essentially become government offices, emphasizing hometown connections and personal relationships. What's the point of sacrificing my studies for this? I am determined to leave this atmosphere.' Generally speaking, this kind of anguish of young people during the War of Resistance is, of course, a problem worthy of attention. If it is not resolved thoroughly and appropriately as soon as possible, it will naturally have a significant adverse impact on the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>All these contradictory phenomena, the anguish of young people, and even pessimism and disappointment, although they have various special reasons, can generally be summarized into the following points: First, the corruption of local political institutions; second, the ignorance and cowardice of a few authorities; third, the insidious poison of certain local feudal remnants; fourth, the rumors, slanders, provocations, and sowing of discord by traitors and wavering compromisers; fifth, the lack of political awareness of a few young people and errors in their service and work methods. We believe that the above five points are very serious symptoms. If these symptoms are not cured, the great cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction will inevitably be seriously hindered. However, at the same time, we must also recognize that these symptoms are absolutely not 'incurable diseases'. There are ways to cure them, and in fact, from the actual situation in various places since the War of Resistance, 'signs of improvement' have appeared sooner or later or more or less!</p>
<p>First of all, we must know that the Chinese nation is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Since the September 18th Incident and up to the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, we have encountered a modern capitalist imperialist country that has accumulated sixty years of planning to conquer us, mobilized its national strength, and launched a full-scale armed invasion. If we had not resisted at that time, then as the supreme leader has declared, China would have already been practically subjugated, and our people would have already practically become colonial slaves of Japanese fascism! But thanks to the wise and brilliant leadership of the supreme leader, and thanks to the close cooperation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all ethnic groups and social classes, we finally launched a full-scale War of Resistance. In the twenty-two months of heroic struggle, we have annihilated 800,000 to 900,000 Japanese soldiers and consumed a significant percentage of Japan's national wealth. In terms of the morale of the people of both countries in fighting, and in terms of the contrast in the international status of the two countries, on the one hand, China has gained widespread sympathy and assistance, and on the other hand, Japan is increasingly isolated and even reduced to a second-rate country! Our successes, both in their speed and greatness, are unprecedented in history! Even in terms of domestic politics, the fact that the government and the people are now standing on the same front, the fact that the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all ethnic groups and social classes, is now openly existing and gradually developing, the fact that achieving democracy, improving people's livelihoods, adhering to the War of Resistance, and building an independent, free, and happy new China, etc., have become the unanimous public opinion of the whole country and have been stipulated in the central government's program for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and in the administrative programs of various provinces and cities - all these politically progressive phenomena today, how could they be compared to what was before the War of Resistance? What one dared to imagine? Of course, we do not think that the current contradictions and the painful phenomena that cause anguish to young people are not worth paying attention to, but we believe that from the perspective of the overall historical law and the curve of the development of the entire political situation, these painful phenomena are already a countercurrent or a residual influence. They absolutely have no power to reverse history, so all pessimism and disappointment are unfounded!</p>
<p>Secondly, the question is how to stop the development of these countercurrents or residual influences, and how to dredge and eliminate these countercurrents or residual influences? We believe that solving this problem is the common task of the entire nation in the current stage to overcome new difficulties, strive for greater victories, and lay the foundation for success. To undertake this task, first, we must rely on our concerted efforts to promote political reform towards a broader and more thorough direction in accordance with the Kuomintang's program for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and the supreme leader's various declarations and announcements. The main thing is to consolidate and expand the unity of all parties and classes in the country and resolutely support the long-term War of Resistance. It is to seriously review and urge the faithful implementation of all resolutions and laws on improving politics since the War of Resistance. It is to strive for the realization of appropriate and necessary democratic politics and the improvement of people's lives. Second, it is necessary to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, and increase the spiritual strength to support the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The main thing is to universally and effectively promote the National Spiritual Mobilization Program and implementation measures. It is necessary to intensify the resolute struggle against the conspiracies of traitors and wavering compromisers and the erroneous arguments of 'anti-communism', 'anti-Chiang', and 'peace', and fundamentally shatter Japan's poisonous scheme of a quick victory and quick peace, using Chinese to control Chinese and using Chinese to destroy Chinese. Third, it is necessary to make redoubled efforts to launch collective learning and cultivation movements, so that every one of our young people can develop the strength to persevere in fighting in dangerous and difficult situations and strive for final victory. Improve and mobilize all the methods of serving the people, wartime service and battlefield service.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to solemnly point out that all of this depends on the unity and struggle of our fighting and revolutionary youth! As long as we can unite and struggle, no countercurrents or residual influences can stop us from moving forward! Moreover, the entire international and domestic political situation is favorable to us! Young people are the main force of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and young people are the masters of the ideal country of the future. We must never underestimate ourselves, and we must never shrink back from difficulties! The ancients said, 'If things were not difficult, what use would there be for us!' Buddha said, 'If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell!' The young people of China today should even more happily persevere in the arduous struggle for justice and freedom. We welcome greater countercurrents and residual influences, and we welcome greater darkness and danger, because after overcoming these, there will be light, freedom, and final victory!</p>
<h3>Launching the Youth and Student Movement with a Focus on Issues Vital to Young People</h3>
<p>— Dou Guang</p>
<p>One of the greatest characteristics of the Chinese youth and student movement is that it has been closely linked to political activities from the very beginning. For example, the heroic and tragic 'May Fourth' and 'December Ninth' Movements launched epoch-making national movements with great historical significance against imperialism - especially against Japanese imperialism - and against feudalism. This demonstrates the progressiveness of Chinese youth and students. They have a high degree of national and political consciousness, and they grasp the political issues that are the key to solving all social problems. They know that only by achieving liberation and freedom in the nation and society can they have their own survival and happiness, and only by today's heroic struggle can they have a victorious and bright future.</p>
<p>In the great tide of today's national revolutionary war, many young intellectuals have already been swept up to participate in various aspects of the War of Resistance. They are bravely fighting in the front lines, the rear areas, and the areas behind enemy lines with a spirit of sacrificing everything. They have contributed a great deal to saving the nation and the country from danger. But let us look again at the general rear area that has a vast area. There are quite a few young people who are in a state of confusion. The youth and student movement is in a scattered and silent atmosphere. Even in places where it is active, it only represents a part of the progressive youth. This is still very far from the urgent situation of the War of Resistance today. Some people say that this is due to the weakness of the intellectuals themselves, a weakness of being afraid of difficulties, afraid of hardship, and easily changed. In fact, this is not a sufficient reason. The reason for this is that the problem is limited by the conditions left over from the historical environment, a political problem. Because even today, there are still some people, especially those who are responsible for leading the youth movement and education, who do not have a deep, thorough, correct, and concrete understanding of the national policy of Chairman Chiang's leadership in uniting to resist the war to the end and striving for final victory, the national defense education policy of the Program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and the revolutionary spirit of the Three Principles of the People, or they are unwilling to understand it; they do not recognize or are unwilling to recognize that the nature of today's youth movement is anti-Japanese, national, and non-partisan; they have not experienced or are unwilling to experience the attitude that leading the youth movement should have a correct relationship between active leadership and respecting its independence. …These problems are precisely alerting us that the youth and student movement should be more closely linked to political issues and further develop this characteristic to fight. To make the majority of young people understand that only by more actively, more deeply, and more broadly participating in various aspects of the War of Resistance can they achieve the victorious resolution of issues vital to them.</p>
<p>Then, in order to develop this characteristic, in order to launch the youth and student movement, the shortcomings of neglecting the issues vital to young people should be overcome in the youth and student movement, and the overall task of the youth movement should be linked to the issues vital to young people. This is the central link of the youth and student movement today. What are the issues vital to young people?</p>
<p>The first is the issue of learning – Due to the lack of experience and knowledge of young people, in order to seek their own independence, in order to seek the liberation of the nation and society, and in order to achieve the lofty ideal of seeking progress and seeking light, they all have a high spirit of learning and go to all aspects to learn. Therefore, 'learning is one of the tasks of young people'. But today, many young people are showing morbidities of frustration, depression, and negativity in the issue of learning; especially for the young people living in schools: The curriculum in the school is still those old textbooks and teaching methods and learning methods that are irrelevant to the War of Resistance, and even opposite to it. They are learning all day long in order to cope with exams, and they have no free time to do extracurricular activities, to read newspapers, discuss various political issues, participate in national salvation work, and engage in sports. So that some progressives gradually leave the school, and some laggards are even more confused. Therefore, it is very necessary to resolve the demands of young people on this issue, provide opinions to the school authorities, ask the school to lead discussions on various issues, and enrich and reform certain topics in the curriculum.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is very important to solve the learning requirements of young people who have dropped out of school and hold various problem seminars, reading clubs, etc. Under the influence of the wartime environment, I do not know how many young people have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>The second is the problem of life – The characteristic of the lives of young students is a kind of joy, liveliness, and new sports and cultural entertainment, etc. They often organize various teams, singing teams, and troupes, etc. to compete and perform, and through and developing these characteristics, to achieve their desire for cultural life, especially to create various new forms of activities with the War of Resistance as the theme, such as practicing throwing hand grenades, climbing mountains, etc., which can not only restore fatigue after learning and working, can exercise a strong physique. And can increase participation in the skills of the War of Resistance. However, in order to enable this issue to unfold smoothly, the kind of development that was limited to artists and athletes in the past, and the kind of concept that was only for championshipism and sectarianism, should be destroyed: Only in this way can the relationship between each other become close, rather than hindering each other's unity: Only in this way can it become a development of mutual observation, rather than mutual jealousy and exclusion.</p>
<p>Secondly, the environment of the school, an environment that has basically organized them, and the youth also has a kind of gregarious psychology, a psychology that if you do it, I will do it too and hope that everyone will do it. It is very good to use and develop this environment and these psychologies to strengthen their organization and establish a democratic, tense, and disciplined collective life to cultivate correct and firm ideological consciousness, which has a guaranteed significance for consolidating the organization of the youth and student movement.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of career – Originally, it was supposed to be a social issue, but young students are just about to live independently, so it is also a vital issue that young people urgently need to solve, and they often hope and demand to solve the issue of their own career. In order to solve this urgent demand, organize organizations such as mutual introduction or mutual help of careers, in order to solve the problem of life: Especially in today's War of Resistance is in a new and severe stage, the country and the nation have a large number of human resources and intellectual resources to participate in various aspects of the War of Resistance: to the army, to the front, to the rear, to the national defense industry, to the transportation construction. …It is very necessary to have a large number of young people organized to serve the War of Resistance. For example, the current situation of the War of Resistance is to launch a wide range of guerrilla warfare in the rear, destroy puppet regimes, and increase the difficulty of the Japanese attack, so that it cannot turn the occupied debt area into a rear area for further advancement, which has a head-on significance. It is a work that is both suitable and willing to do to organize the young people who have fled from the occupied areas to the rear and advance to their hometowns to launch anti-Japanese work and guerrilla warfare, because they have a full of revengeful blood and are very familiar with geography and personnel. This is a practical and powerful work to launch the youth and student movement.</p>
<p>In order to be able to grasp the above several issues that are vital to young people well and enable the youth and student movement to unfold smoothly, then the following are the several main methods:</p>
<p>1. Unite progressive forces to unite all forces. To promote, activate, and develop the work, then it is of major significance to unite advanced elements and seek unity in action. However, it is not only necessary to unite the progressive elements in the youth and students, but also to unite all sympathizers in society and schools, people who strive for progress, and give them active help and leadership, and at the same time, the struggle for the laggards cannot be relaxed. In order to achieve this goal, first of all, there should be a broad mind and a spirit of mutual understanding, not for the dispute of some unprincipled small problems; all problems should be based on the overall situation and work benefits, rather than standing in extreme opposition to each other. Secondly, there should be a humble attitude, respect for other people's opinions, and always solicit other people's opinions, help them express their opinions, and discuss with each other. If there are mistakes, use the spirit of persuasion to correct each other; the conceited idea that only one's own is good and others are not good, and the idea of ​​heroism that oneself is great, should be overcome and destroyed.</p>
<p>2. Go deep among the masses. In order for the vast masses of young people to be mobilized and organized to participate in various aspects of the War of Resistance today, it is very necessary to understand their environment and understand their vital demands; then it is necessary to go deep into their lives. You should take advantage of various opportunities to approach them anytime and anywhere, approach them through the relationships of various relatives, friends, groups, and events, and approach them by using each person's personality and interests; you should not set the conditions for making friends with people too high, have too advanced of ideas, or only limit them to certain narrow areas. For example, only approach him if he is good to you, and do not approach him if he is bad to you; only see his shortcomings and not see his strengths, and then conclude that he is not good, do not approach him, and despise him. This unprincipled attitude is a sin against work. Secondly, in order to gain people's faith, you should also try your best to help them solve various difficult problems. If you can unite the masses more through these works, the easier it will be to achieve victory.</p>
<p>3. Improve people and improve yourself: To get into the community, it is not to mix with them in a vulgar way, but to be able to mobilize the community, then you should improve them, educate and exercise them, so that they have a correct and progressive outlook on life and the world, so that they recognize the current situation of the War of Resistance and their own tasks, and can actively participate in the War of Resistance camp; at the same time, you should also always be a learning model in the work and in the community, so that you can constantly improve and constantly improve in theory to meet the task of bearing this arduous national revolution.</p>
<p>Finally, we should firmly believe that the power of the War of Resistance, the iron current of the times, and the dawn of light are pushing everything forward. Some obstacles that block the progress of history will definitely be overcome and eliminated; do not be negative and distressed when you encounter difficult obstacles, but should have a fighting spirit of foresight of difficulties, recognition of difficulties, and crushing difficulties.</p>
<h3>The Spaniards in Suffering</h3>
<p>— Original by Special Correspondent of the French Humanitarian Newspaper, Translated by Zhao Mei</p>
<p>February 6th, From Ceidife — At three in the morning, Comrade Chuanlie and I ran up the highway leading to Bou. Shize, which was bombed yesterday, was silent at the foot of the mountain. On the mountain, a heavy roar echoed down.</p>
<p>During the day, trucks kept driving up the mountain, sometimes filling the road, blocking a large group of people. At night, the trucks all stopped, lining up on the highway.</p>
<p>Countless Spanish soldiers arrived at the border, and the few members of the International Brigade who had been delayed along the way also arrived. Everyone gathered on the hillside. In the transparent night, rows of stretched bodies could be seen everywhere, tightly wrapped in blankets. In the distance, a long line of freight cars waited on the highway, continuous black shadows, endless.</p>
<p>In the close gaps between the vehicles, a constant stream of refugees passed. Men carried bags or briefcases; women, made wild by fatigue, moved forward with heavy steps. Some used cloth strips to tie babies to their chests because if their legs were still supporting them, their arms hung down broken. Powerless. Huge trucks, fifty, fifty, drove towards France. But the wait for the cars was too long. From two o'clock yesterday until now, not a single car had come to Shize. The waiting drove people crazy, and the firelight in the darkness would make people scream hysterically: what if an air raid comes?</p>
<p>That was the first terrible thing. As dawn gradually broke, revealing the calm waves of the Mediterranean Sea covered with pine, the horror of the people increased. In each car, piles of felt, luggage, and motionless people were lying. The morning was freezing cold, and the tarpaulins covering the cars were also covered with a layer of white frost.</p>
<p>Before the sky was fully bright, a whistle sounding the start of the march reverberated through the valley, and then, in the gray mountainside, countless warriors and refugees of the Spanish Democratic Republic stood up. The lying black shadows came to life and began to descend the mountain towards France. (G.Beaukais)</p>
<p>February 6th, From Paiduisifa — The retreat was carried out in the dark night, and heavy trucks drove past the maple trees on the road. All that could be heard was the sound of sandals rubbing against the ground, miserable moans, and slow sobs.</p>
<p>At the exit of the Paiduis Bridge, an infantryman was stationed. Several harsh lights ruthlessly illuminated the worried faces of the old men and women, and the painful expressions on the small faces of the children. Everyone lined up in a single line, divided into small groups, waiting to enter. The French soldiers next to them looked with pity at this heartbreaking line waiting in the dark.</p>
<p>Here, I found our comrades Barel, Grisa, Ang, and several members of the council, who were going to spend the night here and serve the refugees as they advanced.</p>
<p>A damp cold struck people's shoulders and backs. On the mountainside, the refugees waiting to enter became impatient and lit a bonfire to keep warm. Everyone sat around the fire. The red flames swallowed the darkness, illuminating the forest and the restless people. This was a rare night in the valley.</p>
<p>As soon as it dawned, the guards opened a path for the refugees to pass. The wounded, with their heads and limbs wrapped in dirty cloths, limped forward: their faces were like those who had been tortured, their eyes like those with a fever. Because the wounds were new, and due to the lack of sanitation equipment, they were not properly bandaged. Everyone had to be searched: on the side of the road, a young military doctor had to ask everyone to untie the bandages for inspection, which was very inconvenient for the wounded. Afterwards, everyone gathered at a designated location nearby, and the numbers quickly filled up. But there was no cover above, no bed below, no medicine, and no life-saving medicine. The comrades of the International Central Sanitation Department worked very hard because the government did not give them any help. Even the field hospital was not formed. It was not just insufficient, but as one military doctor said angrily: 'Intentional pretense!'</p>
<p>Those with lighter injuries supported the severely injured with broken arms and legs, a female refugee led a blind person, and a young man with a bandaged leg lay on the back of a mule, constantly moaning.</p>
<p>Due to the rapid driving of the drivers, although the number of cars was small, they quickly carried all the women, children, and wounded to Bulu (Boutou). But after the first batch left, another batch followed closely, tired and aching, holding children, always a heartbreaking line. A guard officer told me in an agitated tone about the tragic situation of the four children. The rebel planes only dropped bombs on civilians. Therefore, after each air raid, almost half of the arriving refugees were injured. The scene was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>The soldiers treated the refugees very well. One officer took his own quilt and covered a mother and her baby, and then he hugged another frozen baby all the way to the car.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the wounded who were so injured that they could not move lay on the ground, damp with mist, in front of the bridge, gritting their teeth, waiting to be transferred to the field hospital. The severely wounded watched their wounds close and reopen, and became infected with poison, and their lives were leaving them every minute.</p>
<p>Could the French government not have taken all necessary measures earlier to help its sister country's people? Their fate is mostly due to the French government's foreign policy! We demand that the French Ministry of Defense immediately provide all sanitary equipment to help the refugees, not only morally should this be the case, but also in response to their fighting for so long to defend our borders.</p>
<p>(Emlle Dectolt)</p>
<p>February 28th, From Shibai — All night long, the light people continued to arrive, gradually decreasing until dawn.</p>
<p>Without any delays along the way, we arrived at this iron (Cerhl). The small station was converted into a field hospital, where four thousand wounded and sick people gathered. Several ambulances were parked on the tracks, loaded with medicines and supplies ready to treat this large group of patients on mud-covered straw.</p>
<p>These ambulances are Spanish. They waited here for eight days, waiting for the French government's order to allow them to cross the border. Unable to cross the border, they could not help the patients. Now only doctors and nurses from the Central Sanitary Department (Centrale Sanitaire) were treating the patients and the wounded under extremely poor conditions.</p>
<p>If they had been allowed to enter French territory earlier—that is, eight days ago—perhaps many people would have been saved. But there was something even worse: until now, no medical supplies had been sent from the French side. All that was being used came from Spain.</p>
<p>All the work was done by the heroic people of the Central Sanitation Department. In addition to constantly attending to patients, they also had to clean the toilets themselves! They were the ones who helped! Food and food distribution. Sometimes, because there were too many wounded and too few service providers, food distribution did not stop until three in the morning. They did all the work, but on the other hand, the station authorities maliciously hindered their work. We have already said that some people are deducting food. At noon, the refugees only get a large spoonful of lentils, or peas, a sausage, a little milk cake, and two small pieces of bread. In the afternoon, it was even smaller, and often cold. We know that the French government pays 7.50 francs per day to each refugee. If the person in charge of food is honest, each person should have a ton of rich food.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can understand why many wounded people cannot withstand the first surgery: the lack of food makes them unable to withstand the surgery.</p>
<p>In view of this, the comrades of the Central Sanitation Department once asked the authorities to allow them to prepare food. In fact, the food donated by the people of various places in France could be used to prepare good food for the refugees, but the answer given by the authorities was a flat refusal. The Central Sanitation Department then requested permission to run army-style mobile kitchens, and the answer was another refusal. They requested the installation of running water pipes, refused, requested the installation of heaters, still refused!</p>
<p>There are a few more things to say.</p>
<p>Last night, a wounded mother slept outdoors in the open air, holding her baby tightly in her arms. Near dawn, it was very cold. The mother woke up and found that the baby in her arms had frozen to death.</p>
<p>An ambulance carrying several severely wounded soldiers went to various hospitals in (Perpiguan), but none were willing to accept them, so they had to be brought back to Shibai, but two of them could not bear it, and died from the violent movement of the car back and forth.</p>
<p>There was no place to put even the corpses. This morning I saw two corpses lying on the railway tracks, lying on stretchers, soaked in sewage, close to the place where the wounded soldiers came out to breathe fresh air. The corpses of heroes. It is such a crime to put them in sewage!</p>
<p>There is one more thing, and that is that in Beibi Kang (Perpigiuan), someone is recruiting soldiers for Franco. There, refugees and wounded soldiers are inspected as soon as they enter the country. As soon as they enter the room, someone immediately asks you: 'Are you willing to go back to Franco?' Then, without saying anything else, they will give you a letter of voluntary service stating that you are willing to return to the rebel area!</p>
<p>Using this forced method, in one day, among the five thousand refugees, they even managed to drive eight hundred people who were willing (?) to return to the rebel side.</p>
<p>Those who are willing to return to the government army side have a yellow card, and those who are willing to go to the rebel side have a green card. I only saw one woman with four children, all holding yellow cards in their hands. I asked what this meant? She added: 'This, this is going to Nagrin!' At the same time, a trace of a smile appeared on her tired face.</p>
<p>Some refugees declared that they would rather commit suicide than go to Franco's side: 'Go there, to be slaves? To suffer to death?'</p>
<p>At the same time, news from Kangdai (Hendaye) said that a train carrying Spanish soldiers back to Bopengge drove into the tunnel near Bayonne (Mousserolle). Because the speed was slow, fifteen soldiers jumped off the train. Isn't this enough to show the true intentions of the Spanish people? (Geonges Beauhofs)</p>
<h3>Soviet Attitude towards British Negotiations</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>(Special Translation) The Soviet News reported in an editorial on May 12, "The events of the past few weeks have fundamentally changed the European situation. By this, we mean first of all Hitler's speech in the German Parliament, and secondly the conclusion of the Italo-German military and political alliance. Western European political leaders mostly claim that these two events have not changed the situation in Europe. In fact, this is not the case. Not only that, but the purpose of this kind of rhetoric is to deceive public opinion. In fact, these two events have indeed made the entire political situation worse. First of all, as a result of Hitler's declaration in the Parliament, two important agreements have been eliminated. The original Anglo-German naval agreement has been cancelled since Hitler's declaration. At the same time, the German-Polish non-aggression pact also ceased to exist due to Hitler's declaration. How can the sudden cancellation of these two important treaties be said not to have caused changes in the international situation? As for the establishment of the German-Italian political and military alliance, it has also dealt a heavy blow to the situation before the incident. Some countries had hoped and tried to break up the Italo-German relationship and isolate Germany. This kind of hope and attempt is now completely hopeless. The Soviet people have repeatedly stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact jointly established by Germany, Italy and Japan is actually a mask to cover up the aggressive group of countries against Britain and France. In the past, many people did not believe it or even criticized it, but now the facts fully prove it. Such an environment has prompted democratic countries to intensify their efforts to try to form a united front for peace to resist the developing aggression. For example, the British and Soviet negotiations. Regarding this negotiation, politicians and the press of various countries have repeatedly spread malicious rumors about the Soviet Union's attitude, falsely claiming that the Soviet Union requires that even if it does not immediately take confrontational actions against aggressor countries, it should conclude a direct military alliance with Britain and France. This kind of statement, which has absolutely nothing in common with the Soviet Union's attitude, is not worth deceiving. The Soviet Union's past and future claims are that if Britain and France really want to build a bulwark against aggression in Europe, they must establish a mutual assistance united front. This front should mainly include Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, or at least Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. We must point out that this frank and fundamentally defensive and peaceful Soviet attitude, which is based on mutual principles and equal obligations, has not been responded to sympathetically by Britain and France. As everyone knows, Britain, with the consent of France, has put forward a counter-proposal, in which Britain avoids discussing the issue of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, and believes that the Soviet Union should immediately provide assistance when Britain and France are involved in hostile actions due to the implementation of guarantees for Poland and Romania. As for the assistance that should be obtained from Britain and France in accordance with the five-phase principle when the Soviet Union is involved in hostile actions due to fulfilling its guarantee obligations to any Eastern European country or will give it, it is never mentioned. In this way, although the Soviet Union undertakes exactly the same obligations as Britain and France, its position is not equal. At the same time, a very significant fact is that under this kind of arrangement, the right to decide whether to actually resist aggression and when to start resistance is entirely in the hands of Britain and France. Although the heavy responsibility of resistance, due to geographical relations, should mainly be borne by the Soviet Union. Some people say that Britain and France's defense of Poland and Romania is actually equal to defending the western border of the Soviet Union. This statement is absolutely not true. First, the western border of the Soviet Union is not limited to the Baltic countries. Secondly, and more importantly, Britain and France's defense of the Baltic countries is actually defending their own country, not the western border of the Soviet Union. Because they have a five-party assistance treaty with Poland, Poland must turn around and defend Britain and France against aggression. As for Romania, because it has a treaty of alliance with Poland, it must follow Poland, so Romania is actually an indirect ally of Britain and France. The position of the Soviet Union is completely different. It has no mutual assistance treaty with Britain, France, and Poland, but now it should agree to assist the above three countries without receiving any assistance from the three countries, and when the Soviet Union is directly invaded, it can only rely on itself. In this way, the Soviet Union is obviously in an unequal position.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Tension in Shanghai: Strict Security Measures in the Concessions; Rumors Abound of a Japanese Armed Seizure of the International Settlement; The Municipal Council Made Necessary Contingency Arrangements Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] Shanghai dispatch: Since the news of the Japanese troops landing on Gulangyu was released, the Shanghai Concession authorities have been on high alert due to constant pressure from the Japanese, preparing for any eventuality. A senior police officer expressed that the Japanese army might enter the concessions at any time, causing widespread panic, which was not alleviated by the strong stance of the U.S. and Britain. From early morning on the 19th, additional defenses were set up between the International Settlement and the French Concession, restoring the tense atmosphere of July 7th last year. Except for the main roads that remained open to vehicles and pedestrians, the rest of the area between the two concessions was blocked by barbed wire and sandbags. The French Concession also dispatched a large number of Vietnamese police and French police to conduct house-to-house searches in residential areas, aiming to find firearms and contraband. However, no incidents had occurred as of noon. It was rumored that on the afternoon of the 18th, Japanese troops in Hongkou suddenly mobilized, imposing special martial law and setting up sentries in the Yangshupu area, before withdrawing at 7 pm. The sudden heightened security in the concessions might be related to this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai foreign dispatch: All French Concession police officers, members of the merchant corps, and French naval and land forces were secretly mobilized last night, and starting at 6 am this morning, they began conducting an unprecedented large-scale operation in the French Concession. This morning, obstacles have been placed at street corners within the concession, as well as at the boundaries between the French Concession and the International Settlement. Roads from the French Concession to the International Settlement, except for the most important ones, have been completely closed to traffic. Police officers and merchant corps members are searching pedestrians at various entry points, in small teams of up to four people, conducting spot checks. Chinese residences are being searched. It is reported that the purpose of this morning's operation is to apprehend political elements within the concession. The plan was extremely secretive, with police officers and French military officers only receiving orders from the authorities at 8 pm last night, and informing their subordinates to mobilize only this morning. Members of the French Merchant Corps were notified individually by special envoys sent by the authorities to their residences between 9 pm and 12 am last night. As for the members of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps in the International Settlement, they were only notified by telephone by the authorities at 5 am this morning to report for duty. This plan was so carefully executed that terrorist elements were unable to learn of the authorities' actions and escape into the International Settlement or other places beforehand. As of now, no unexpected incidents have occurred, and no one has been arrested. This morning, all newspapers published brief news about the mobilization of the merchant corps, but no one knew the reason. Some said that the mobilization of the merchant corps was a show of force to Japan, which is further evidence of the authorities' meticulous planning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 11th] This morning, cargo trucks were speeding through the streets, while Chinese workers from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department were dividing up and installing barbed wire on various streets, cutting off traffic. Although the Municipal Council had notified newspaper offices not to publicize the matter, last night various newspapers had already briefly reported on the rumors that the Japanese army would forcibly seize the International Settlement. Municipal Council police officers were ordered to patrol yesterday, and today a large number of British and American naval forces were also dispatched to conduct large-scale searches of Chinese residences and hotels, particularly in areas believed to be hiding anti-Japanese elements. British and American naval forces are assisting the police in the British and American defense zones, respectively, but the search work is still being carried out by the police. At the same time, the Shanghai People's Volunteer Corps has also been ordered to be ready to be mobilized at any time. Today's Shanghai has completely entered a state of wartime. All that can be seen in the city are soldiers, guns, and barbed wire. The purpose of the Municipal Council's actions is generally believed to be to prevent the Japanese from having an excuse, to show that the Municipal Council is working hard to curb anti-Japanese activities in the concession, and to show that the Municipal Council has taken strong measures to stop the activities of lawless elements in order to avoid disputes. Therefore, this may be a warning to certain "terrorist elements" who specialize in creating incidents, preventing them from causing further trouble. The police department refused to comment on this view. At the same time, they did not deny the other rumor that the Municipal Council's purpose was to cut off the communication between the western district gambling dens and opium dens and the concession. Some observers believe that the Municipal Council's actions, after continuing to reject Japanese demands, are a sign to the Japanese that the concession authorities can handle any situation and do not need the Japanese to help.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 19th] Last night, all military police and volunteer corps in the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession were secretly preparing. At around 6 am this morning, searches began in the French Concession on an unprecedented scale. From midnight, three-quarters of the intersections in the French Concession were suddenly closed. At the border between the International Settlement and the French Concession, the International Volunteer Corps set up barbed wire to guard the area. Anyone entering the International Settlement from the French Concession was subjected to searches by military police and volunteer corps members. Military police patrolled the French Concession, questioning pedestrians on the street and searching Chinese residences, with the intention of clearing out political activities and terrorist elements. The French Concession authorities' actions were extremely secretive, and it was expected that these elements would not be able to escape. No incidents have been reported so far, and no arrests have been announced.</p>
<h3>Sharp Fall in the Japanese Yen: Breaks Record Since the Start of the War</h3>

<h3>Britain Resolutely Rejects Unreasonable Demands from Japan; Japan Believes the Response from Various Countries is Insufficient and Decides to Put More Pressure on the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 19th] According to Japanese sources, after the United States notified Japan on the 17th that it rejected Japan's request to revise the administrative rights of the Shanghai International Settlement, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie also delivered the British response to the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 11 am today. The response completely rejected Japan's demands, including increasing Japanese representatives in the Municipal Council, revising the Land Regulations, and reorganizing the Special District Court. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared this morning that such observations from various countries would not affect Japan's established policies. Japan has repeatedly requested that various countries allow revisions to the Shanghai International Settlement situation, entirely for the important task of "establishing a new order in East Asia." The spokesperson also stated that Japan did not expect a response from various countries, and would continue negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared today that no foreign country can change Japan's fixed policy on foreign concessions in China, but the Japanese government is still willing to hold friendly talks with relevant countries to resolve this issue.</p>
<h3>A Glorious Page of War History in Ronghe, Southern Shanxi: Our Suicide Squad Attacks Japanese Special Service Agency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji Dispatch] The Taiyuan Special Service Agency was promoted to the Shanxi Provincial Special Service Agency this spring. Colonel Inoue succeeded Tani Oginohana Yu as the head of the agency, expanding the organization and spreading its henchmen to various occupied counties. The Yuncheng Special Service Agency established a branch office at Miaoqian Ferry, 45 li west of Ronghe County, as an important agency for directing and plotting conspiracies in southwestern Shanxi. At the same time, Nakamura Isamu was specially appointed as the instructor of the puppet Ronghe Imperial Collaboration Army and the advisor to the 2nd Detachment of the Puppet Imperial Collaboration Bandit Suppression Army, obviously an important element of the Japanese and puppets in southern Shanxi. The Yuncheng Special Service Agency's Miaoqian Ferry branch office was located in the home of Chen Zizhang, a civilian. There were originally six staff members, and recently four more have been sent from Yuncheng to strengthen the work in southern Shanxi. Japanese Captain Sakamoto led a unit of about 60 men, with four light and heavy machine guns, stationed inside the Fengzha Miaoqian Fort to cover the branch office. The garrison point was only 300 meters away from the branch office. Many of the veterans in the Ronghe puppet Imperial Collaboration Army were loyal and patriotic individuals, who often felt "their hearts were in Han while their bodies were in the barbarian land." They were often mistreated by Nakamura and hated him to the bone. Since March, Shang Lao's units, including Cai Qingsan and Wang Fuqun, have successively led their troops to revolt. Cai Qingsan's more than 500 men, with complete equipment, were the most powerful, which was a major blow to the Japanese and puppet forces in southern Shanxi. After Cai and others revolted, they were reorganized into the 1st Detachment of the Security Forces, and first thoroughly destroyed the highway and power lines between Wanquan and Yangzhu, about 40 li. Then they fought with the Japanese and achieved many victories. Nakamura Isamu deeply hated Cai and others for this, and detained all of Cai's family members, involving more than 40 people, and imprisoned them in the special service agency. On the morning of April 28, Cai was ordered to attack the Miaoqian Special Service Agency and was very excited. He then discussed the steps to complete the mission with his subordinates. Battalion Commander Jiang Ziyun said, "How can we get the tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" After he spoke, eleven team members volunteered to dedicate their lives. At the same time, four policemen from the Ronghe Public Security Bureau volunteered to participate. He then led 16 strong men, each with a pistol, and departed from Tong'ai, which belonged to Wanquan, at 2 pm on the fourth day of the month. At 8 pm, they arrived at Zhonglizhuang and asked familiar villagers to borrow kitchen knives. The villagers, knowing that they were going to attack the Japanese, immediately gathered 17 kitchen knives and said to Jiang and others, "We hope to kill the Japanese as easily as cutting vegetables." Taking advantage of the night, they continued to advance. At around 9 pm, they arrived at the Miaoqian Ferry and sneaked to the special service agency. They knocked on the ring, and soon Zhang Zihe, a Chinese traitor, opened the door. Jiang and others rushed in and immediately put a knife to Zhang's neck, forbidding him to make a sound. After asking about Nakamura Isamu's residence, they raised their knives and struck. This Japanese running dog was already decapitated. The group went straight to Nakamura's room. He happened to be lying down, and seeing the situation, he knew it was urgent and drew his gun to resist. He was quickly embraced by our brave soldiers, and they chopped him with kitchen knives. At the same time, they split up to search each room. The eleven members of the Japanese agency, panicked and scurrying, tried to escape through the door, but were all bravely hacked to death by our men, lying in pools of blood. These eleven heinous traitors were not spared. It is said that many of the Japanese special service personnel were familiar with our situation and well-trained. Killing these eleven men was like killing nearly a hundred Japanese. This matter took only ten minutes from start to finish. The forty family members of Cai Qingsan and others were also all rescued by us. We seized one pistol, one lightweight wireless radio, one letter of appointment for Nakamura Isamu, and more than ten other documents. The Japanese soldiers protecting the area heard the news and opened fire. Our strong men had already quietly left. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese and puppet troops from Wanquan, Lingao, Ronghe, and other areas gathered nearly a thousand men and advanced towards the Zhicun Miao area of Wanquan County, as if facing a formidable enemy. When they arrived, the rooms were empty and the fields were cleared. We had not a single soldier. The Japanese attacked and found nothing, and retreated in despair. After reporting the incident, a certain commander praised the bravery and heroic sacrifice of the strong men who risked attacking the Japanese, and issued an order to commend them.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Britain, America, and France in the Far East: Well Received by All Parties, Considered the Only Good Policy at Present</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] After the naval and marine corps of Britain, France, and the United States landed on Gulangyu at the same time, government insiders here commented that the three major democracies have a linked relationship and have decided to jointly protect their interests in the Far East. Diplomatic protests alone can be said to be ineffective. If Japan joins the military alliance treaty and is encouraged by Germany and Italy to pursue anti-French and anti-British policies, then Britain, France, and the United States should jointly take defensive measures to deal with them. The United Kingdom recently convened the Pacific Conference in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, to discuss the protection of various territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The defense plan agreed upon advocated cooperation between Britain and France to mutually protect all territories. The British government has notified France of the results of the meeting, and the United States has also joined this defense organization in practice.</p>
<h3>Influential British Newspaper Bitterly Complains that Weakness is Not a Solution, Deeply Delighted and Fortunate for America's Strong Attitude</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The "Manchester Guardian" recently published an article commenting on the Gulangyu incident, saying that this incident was clearly deliberately created by the Japanese to test the reaction of Western powers in order to prepare for a larger operation in Shanghai. The report also said that "the most exciting fact is the attitude of the United States government, which first protested and first dispatched sailors to land, and took cooperative action with all parties in Britain without shirking responsibility. This is enough to awaken the mentally confused government of our country, which, although it has repeatedly failed in Europe, still hopes to maintain its appeasement policy in the Far East. However, the only result of the appeasement policy is to provoke strong anti-British movements in Japan and the Japanese-occupied areas in China, because aggression must attack the opponent's weaknesses. Since the United States is prepared to cooperate with Britain to protect their common interests in Gulangyu, then the United States will also be prepared to cooperate with Britain to protect their common interests in Shanghai and other places when necessary. Some believe that once Britain forms an alliance with the Soviet Union, it may cause negative reactions in Japan's policy. This kind of fear can be comforted by the United States' willingness to cooperate."</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Naval Landings in Gulangyu Shock Japan; Asahi Shimbun Worries About Over-Expansion; Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Makes Twisted Explanation and Ridicules</h3>
<p>[Haitong News, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese people in all walks of life were shocked to hear that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States jointly dispatched troops to land in Gulangyu. Last night, newspapers here all criticized the move, saying that it had anti-Japanese implications. However, Japan does not want to expand the incident, and the Asahi Shimbun said that there is a risk of the matter expanding, but the newspaper did not mention the outcome.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared today that no foreigners in Gulangyu were injured by the Japanese naval and marine corps that landed. However, foreign newspapers carried contrary news. It is regrettable that Britain, the United States, and France have taken joint action, concentrated warships, and dispatched sailors to land, because the reason for these countries to take this action is that the Japanese naval and marine corps searched foreigners in Gulangyu. But in fact, the Japanese did not do this, and no foreigners were injured by the Japanese military. Last year, the Japanese army patrolled Gulangyu for two months, and foreign warships did not dispatch troops to land, nor did the Japanese receive any notes or protests from any foreign country.</p>
<h3>National Production Conference Declaration (3)</h3>
<p>Mining Industry</p>
<p>To further develop production, let's discuss the mining industry. Developing the mining industry to enhance rear area production and enrich national finances is a crucial task at present. The mineral resources of the southwest and northwest provinces related to national defense, military needs, or civil industries include coal, iron, oil, copper, and zinc in provinces such as Sichuan, Kang (Xikang), Shaanxi, Gansu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Those related to international trade or foreign exchange include gold, tin, tungsten, antimony, and mercury in provinces such as Kang (Xikang), Qinghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Their distribution is wide, and their reserves are abundant. Furthermore, new mines are constantly being discovered, demanding full development. In the future, the unexploited mineral resources in the southwest and northwest provinces should be actively explored, and the best ones should be selected for mining and smelting. For existing mines and smelters, regardless of whether they use modern or traditional methods, efforts should be intensified to promote guidance, maintenance, adjustment, expansion, and improvement to achieve the greatest possible effect with available funds in the near future. Regarding the expenses for exploring new mines or expanding, improving, and relocating smelters, if there are insufficient funds, the government should allocate funds to assist, so that both state-owned and private mines can develop simultaneously, ensuring that the resources for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction will not be depleted. For state-owned mines, emphasis should be placed on cooperation between the central and provincial governments. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Sales and Transportation Methods</p>
<p>Regarding the sales and transportation of mineral products, they can be classified based on type as either for export or for domestic consumption. For mineral products that maintain foreign exchange and develop international trade, constructing or improving international railways to facilitate exports is crucial. For mineral products that supply domestic industry and military needs, branch lines of domestic railways should be connected to major mining areas in advance to increase transportation capacity and reduce transportation costs, time, and effort, so that the production and smelting of various important mineral products can gradually meet the corresponding supply and demand. As for mineral products that should be under state control, the central government should manage them in a unified manner. Any special control measures originally established by the provinces should be abolished to achieve consistency. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Talent Cultivation</p>
<p>Regarding the cultivation of mining industry talent, domestic university mining and metallurgy departments should emphasize both theory and practice. In addition to mining and metallurgy, students should be assigned to major mines and smelters for practical training. For mineral processing, equipment should be increased to allow students to practice at any time to prepare for application, so that various mixed ore minerals can be fully distinguished, utilized, and increase efficiency. In addition, special attention should be paid to the training of mine foremen and workers. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Administrative Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding iron industry administration, based on the current situation of the domestic mining industry, it is gradually becoming more consistent than before. However, the responsible government agencies in various provinces should strive for unification and simplification, and urge the increase in mineral production. It is not only necessary to increase surveying teams to facilitate the people's access to mining rights, but also to strictly enforce mining laws. For mines that have already obtained permits but have not yet started construction or have suspended work, strict measures should be taken to avoid the virtual occupation of mining areas and hindering production. For mines where people have applied for mining rights but have not yet been surveyed, they should be urged to conduct surveys within a limited time and transfer the permits to facilitate merchants and benefit production. In addition to the temporary measures for limited application and management of coal and gold mines that the government has already promulgated, the expansions that were previously approved for mining by the responsible government agencies in various provinces should all be presented for replacement with permits, in order to consolidate mining rights. Old soil mines that are privately mined should be ordered to establish rights in accordance with the law within a limited time to avoid affecting the entire mining industry. This is the fourth point. The above four points are all matters that the central and local governments should urgently undertake for mining production, and should be implemented earnestly to benefit the mining administration. The development and construction of agriculture, forestry, industry, and mining have been outlined, but without complete and inexpensive transportation, even if production increases, sales will be hindered, which will not only fail to supplement military supplies but may also lead to blockage and collapse. Production relies on transportation to facilitate flow, and then supply and demand can be adjusted, and trade can prosper, leading to development and prosperity. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, the basic resources needed for national defense and the large quantities of products exported rely on transportation as their lifeline. The southwest and northwest regions are vast, with continuous mountains, and relying solely on highway transportation is not only too slow to be effective but also too wasteful. The newly built international transportation railways cannot be completed in a short period of time. If no other remedies are taken, the future will become increasingly difficult. Today, those who discuss economic construction in the southwest place too much emphasis on alleviating the current commercial suffering and neglect the study of transportation, resulting in the problem of mismatch between supply and demand. The current plan must be to adjust all transportation materials and统筹(coordinate) them, and adjust the quantity of various materials, transportation capacity, the amount of labor and materials, and the presence or absence of motive power before pushing the entire work of产运销存(production, transportation, sales, and storage). We believe that today's transportation construction, in addition to the international transportation lines in the southwest and northwest, should be considered. The key to saving time is: first, the construction of light railways. Although standard railways have their advantages, they are too expensive and take too long, which is not as fast as the completion of light railways. They are cheap and easy to popularize, so it is recommended that the government promptly prepare for the construction of light railways, which should be listed as the main body of land transportation tools; The second is the sorting out of the existing highways, such as the reduction of the gradient, the improvement of the roadbed, the strengthening of the bridges, and the addition of ferry boats, which are all important tasks for today's transportation improvement. The righteous or difficult to implement because of the cost of the project, and do not know that under the current deteriorating state of the highway, the damage of automobiles every year is calculated in hundreds of millions of yuan, which can sort out the national highway and have more than enough. The third is the application of human and animal power. After the highways are sorted out, the new improved carriages can pass unimpeded, using our country's own timber to build cars, using our own mules and horses to transport, not only cheap and labor-saving, and the foreign exchange burden due to gasoline saving will also be uncountable. Fourthly, the drainage of waterway, the southwest provinces, with vertical and horizontal canals, are rich in the profit of boats. A little drainage can be used for boats, and wood can be cut down the mountain to build ships along the river. The amount of a boat exceeds the car, which is not only convenient for military transportation, but also can smooth the flow of goods. The improvement of domestic transportation tools is more difficult to clumsy 塞到外的漏巵(leak of blocking) and increase the convenience of transportation. All four of these suggestions are easy to implement. If they can be promoted step by step, they can not only benefit military transportation, but also help the development of production and construction. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>British New Note Sent to Moscow, Lloyd George and Others Deliver Passionate Speeches, France Hopes UK and Soviet Union Will Establish an Agreement Quickly</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] According to senior diplomatic officials here, who told the Associated Press reporter last night, British Foreign Secretary Halifax has already notified the French government that Britain has accepted the Soviet Union's proposal in principle. If the Soviet Union provokes a war due to assistance to Poland, Romania, and Turkey, Britain will provide assistance on a reciprocal basis. They also notified the French government that Britain's new note is on its way to Moscow. In the note, Britain suggests that the UK, France, and the Soviet Union mutually guarantee each other to deal with wars caused by the UK and France due to assistance to Poland, Romania, and Turkey. However, Britain still refuses to guarantee the small Baltic countries, but may invite the Soviet Union to participate in a joint guarantee to Poland, Romania, and Turkey. If the Soviet Union provokes a war due to assistance to Poland, Romania, and Turkey, the UK and France will certainly provide assistance.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 18th] According to political figures here, Britain's new note was sent out this afternoon. The British note is based on the original French plan, stating that if the Soviet Union is drawn into the war due to assistance to countries guaranteed by Britain and France, Britain and France will provide assistance. In other words, if the Soviet Union gets into the war due to assisting Poland and Romania, Britain and France will immediately provide assistance.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 18th] Before the British reply to the Soviet Union was sent out, diplomatic negotiations were underway. Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office several times. After the visit, he returned to the embassy and discussed with Moscow by long-distance telephone. The press here, especially 'Le Radicale', hopes that the UK-Soviet agreement can be established in the near future and believes that Chamberlain will be able to present a concrete report at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow afternoon. According to the newspaper's opinion, Britain does not want to take on too much burden in the current situation, so it is unwilling to publicly establish a military agreement, so as not to give more basis to the theory of encircling the Axis countries. 'Le Radicale' also stated that France had urged Britain to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. 'Le Parisien' denied that the Foreign Office had put forward a compromise plan and said that if there was still no success when the League of Nations met, Halifax might go to Moscow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Lloyd George delivered a passionate speech in the House of Commons today in a debate on diplomatic events, referring to the next action of the dictatorial countries. He said, "The preparation of the dictatorial countries at this time is unprecedented and worthy of attention. Its purpose is to defeat us. If we want to obtain peace in place of alley warfare, we can only prepare military strength to deal with emergencies and cooperate with all countries to resist aggression. Regarding the Soviet Union, if we are unwilling to approach it, but we have made guarantees to Poland and Romania, why not quickly decide to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, just like establishing an agreement with France?" Opposition leader Attlee believed that Lloyd George had made a dark and true statement about the current world situation. Attlee believes that Britain has no constructive peace efforts at present, but is only waiting for the next act of aggression, and said, "We must recognize the aggressive policy of the Axis countries. The armed thugs in Europe are prepared to blackmail anyone."</p>
<p>Chamberlain Discusses Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] When the House of Commons debated foreign policy today, Prime Minister Chamberlain (pictured) rose to speak after Attlee to cheers from the crowd. He began by saying that he did not want to discuss diplomatic issues today, because the present time is a tense, urgent, and apprehensive period. He knows very well that his words can be heard not only by all members, but also by the whole world, and studied carefully. "There are some people who have ulterior motives and specialize in picking on words, which may distort what is said today and produce misleading meanings. Mr. Attlee has said that a long-term peace policy is needed, and the colonial issue is also a part of it. We in this country have no intention of buying peace at the price of concessions, so it is enough to cause endless demands. However, this does not mean that we refuse to discuss with other countries any way to satisfy the emotions of other countries, even if that method is to revise the current situation. We are also willing to discuss it. If this method can guarantee a discussion in a good atmosphere, the problem may be easily solved. If there are no special difficulties during the negotiation, there may be more concessions, but the acquisition of this concession must be used for what it has promised, and cannot infringe upon the freedom of others. Until we are completely satisfied that the other party has abandoned the attempt to invade others, it is difficult for us to discuss the final conditions of peace.</p>
<p>German Government's Actions Contradict Guarantees</p>
<p>The German government has declared that it has no intention of annexing others, but unfortunately, those who oppose it dare not believe it, and there are many. This attitude of disbelief is also what the German government has caused (cheers). If we are sure that the other party has abandoned the attempt to invade and has no intention of using force between Germany and other countries, I believe that we will not shrink back for long and explain our views and routes for discussing permanent peace. The United States' greatest desire is to maintain peace, which should be believed with an international spirit. Britain's desire is only that various needs can be balanced in order to achieve the best completion. This means that the requirements and rights of all countries should be taken into account, and then we can discuss how to establish a route for lasting peace." Referring to Lloyd George's speech, Chamberlain said that he did not ignore the seriousness of the situation, but Lloyd George exaggerated it. There is nothing unusual or surprising about the withdrawal of the British Embassy in Prague. Regarding the permission to transfer Czech property abroad, which is helpful to Germany, Chamberlain said, "I really don't know whether the German government knows that its actions have caused a major reaction around the world. I believe that the German government's actions completely contradict the guarantees it has repeatedly given to the world. It has caused more unease among people around the world than its annexation of others. This contradiction has completely destroyed the sense of security and created a widespread feeling that once any small country is noticed by Germany's ambitions, it will be difficult to preserve its independence. Therefore, we increasingly feel that if we cannot use some new elements to stabilize the situation today, a large part of the European continent will disintegrate. The British government, in view of this, feels that it should immediately join hands with France to intervene. If France provides the above-mentioned elements to stabilize the situation, the threat of German aggression is quite acute, so we have to persuade quickly. However, the guarantees we have made to Poland and Turkey are not the final goal of our plan. These guarantees are proposed to avoid further deterioration of the situation, and can be called 'emergency measures'. In other words, we should go further and plan for a more permanent countermeasure to strengthen the power of the above guarantee and try to reach out to other great powers who are willing to contribute assistance. Although, I would still like to be clear that our policy does not mean that the European countries will form hostile groups. The formation of these groups is incited by mutual 'bad feelings' and they think the war is inevitable. Before the war has broken out, I never feel that war is inevitable, and the dimmer the situation and the more pressing the war is, the more I feel the need to make efforts to stop the war. We believe that any policy, if it aims to create hostile groups, is inherently unstable, so it is fundamentally dangerous. As for the policy we are following today, it has no aggressive components, and we will never refuse the opportunity to discuss all differences with an international spirit of amity. This is a policy of precaution and will not be implemented unless in a certain situation.</p>
<p>Must Prevent Violent Aggression</p>
<p>Whether that certain situation will happen or not, the power is in the hands of other countries. This means that our policy is to prevent violent acts of aggression. Acts of aggression may not happen, and we hope that they will never happen. This is a necessary policy. Without this policy, we cannot achieve stability in Europe, and the lives of businesses will be affected, and the living conditions of the people cannot be improved. We have offered guarantees to several countries, but this is not enough. We are willing to have other countries join and assist these countries together, so we are negotiating with the Soviet Union and Turkey. Regarding the UK-Turkish negotiations, the UK and Turkish governments quickly expressed the same interests and opinions, so a declaration was established on May 12. The declaration was warmly welcomed, which is enough to show the honor of Turkey and the preciousness of its friendship. UK-Turkish friendship began during the era of President Kemal, and under the current President, this friendship is increasing day by day.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The "News Chronicle's" correspondent in the Yugoslavian capital reports that Prince Paul has returned from Rome. His discussions with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano have resulted in a preliminary agreement for Yugoslavia to join the German-Italian Axis.

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Abrupt Tensions in the Shanghai International Settlement</h3>
<p>According to news reports today, the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement has suddenly become tense. Settlement authorities have implemented special martial law, with all foreign troops, police, and volunteer corps mobilized. The streets and alleys are filled with uniforms, firearms, and barbed wire, creating a state of wartime readiness.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the tension in Shanghai lies in Japan's preparation to implement armed occupation. The sudden and unprecedented surge in tension in the past two days indicates that the settlement authorities are unwilling to surrender all rights and interests to Japan. The emergency measures taken by the settlement authorities, similar to the landing of British, American, and French sailors on Gulangyu, is a clear warning to Japan: "Do not go too far. Britain, America, and France will not easily withdraw from the Far East!"</p>
<p>However, we remain pessimistic about the future of Shanghai, as we do about the Gulangyu incident and the situations in Tianjin and Hankou. Firstly, the desire to seize the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other European powers' bases of influence and interests in the Far East is not only part of Japan's overall invasion plan, but also a necessary and urgent measure to remedy and reverse their setbacks in the invasion of China. Therefore, unless subjected to effective strikes by European and American powers, Japan's harassing actions will never "stop at the appropriate point"! All menacing threats are simply Japan's proud tactics and will certainly not scare them away! Secondly, the measures currently taken by the European and American democratic and peaceful countries to restrain Japan are obviously not strong enough. Moreover, the tactics employed by the settlement authorities today, such as overstepping their authority to suppress Chinese newspapers that support China, and carrying out large-scale crackdowns on anti-Japanese elements, may be said to be aimed at avoiding pretexts for Japan to provoke greater incidents. However, since Japan is looking for opportunities, they will not lack excuses. Instead of upholding law and order based on justice and the concession bylaws, they are yielding to Japan's demands by violating the laws, which not only undermine their own position but also provide Japan with opportunities to exploit. In the future, all Chinese residents in the concessions can be labeled as anti-Japanese or communist, and even if all Chinese are expelled, Westerners can still be accused of supporting China, being anti-Japanese, or being communist. What unimaginable disasters will lie ahead?</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that in order to prevent Japan from further implementing armed occupation and annexation, the landing of British, American, and French sailors on Gulangyu and the adoption of wartime preparations by the Shanghai settlement authorities as demonstrations of strength against Japan are absolutely necessary and appropriate. We believe that our compatriots residing in Shanghai and other concessions will be happy to accept various restrictions in order to see the demonstrations of strength by democratic and peaceful allies such as Britain, America, and France. However, if there are only these demonstrations without further effective restraints on Japan, or even if these demonstrations severely suppress all anti-Japanese and anti-aggression forces, it will not only fail to prevent Japan's further encroachments but may even fuel their arrogance! Therefore, our task today is to intensify all diplomatic efforts, urge democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, America, and France not to miss the last opportunity, strengthen their own unity, and step up efforts to support China and restrain Japan. Otherwise, what China loses will be only this much, while the European and American democratic and peaceful allies will be forced to withdraw completely from the Far East. In addition, all parties should learn from the experiences of Shanghai and Gulangyu, become serious and vigilant, abandon decadent and degenerate behaviors, and actively promote all work to return to the country and assist the motherland! Times are critical, don't dream anymore!</p>

<h3>Air Defense Commissioner Officially Announces Emergency Air Defense Drills Will Be Conducted at Any Time: No Prior Notice Will Be Given to Residents, Who Should Be Prepared for Blackouts at All Times; Seven New Siren Machines Arriving from England Will Reach Hong Kong During the Day</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's air defense work, according to the original plan of the Hong Kong government, is being actively carried out. After more than ten months, considerable progress has been made, and the air defense work has entered another stage. It is understood that the current air defense authorities are actively seeking residents' cooperation with the government, widely promoting air defense, so that all residents of Hong Kong, regardless of gender or age, can understand and acquire knowledge about escaping air raids. On the one hand, they are intensifying the planning of disaster relief locations and the deployment of resident evacuation, so that in the event of war and Hong Kong being attacked, residents can follow the common sense they have acquired and evacuate in an orderly manner, without being caught off guard. Regarding blackout drills, several have been held in the past two years, but they have all been of a general nature. The authorities announced the dates in advance each time. This kind of regular exercise cannot meet the needs of wartime. Therefore, the Air Defense Committee has decided to hold a wartime air defense exercise in the near future to train residents to respond to emergencies. Regarding the duration of the exercise, the authorities have not yet made a clear announcement. The reporter interviewed the Air Defense Commissioner yesterday, who said that the air defense exercise could be held at any time. In order to test whether residents can calmly cope, the date must be kept secret and no prior notice will be given. During this period, residents of Hong Kong should be fully prepared at all times to avoid panic in an emergency. As for the sirens, the number was previously too small, and the sirens could not be spread to all areas of Hong Kong. Since the new sirens arrived from England a few days ago, a test has been done and good results have been obtained. A total of six of these new sirens have now arrived in Hong Kong, distributed in various areas of Hong Kong. There are still seven more being shipped from England and will arrive in Hong Kong during the day. The installation locations of these seven new sirens have not yet been determined and may be distributed in the Kowloon area in the future.</p>
<h3>China Salvation Drama Troupe Hosts Reception Today: Benefit Performances are Imminent, Departing Abroad Immediately After Performances to Seek Guidance; Notable Figures from All Walks of Life Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>The China Salvation Drama Troupe, which has been fighting on the northern front for twenty months and is loved by millions of soldiers and civilians, will go to the Nanyang area to comfort overseas Chinese and complete a greater propaganda and economic mission. Since arriving in Hong Kong, the troupe has been warmly welcomed by various organizations. Various groups have admired the troupe's skilled theatrical arts and requested it to perform a large-scale public performance in Hong Kong before leaving China, in order to raise funds for disaster relief and expand the propaganda for national salvation. It has now been scheduled to perform "Long Live the Nation," "Defend the Motherland," and "Spring in Taierzhuang" and other famous plays at the Lee Theatre on the evenings of the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, which will surely create an unprecedented and grand occasion in Hong Kong. Entrusted by the Disaster Relief Federation, the Reporters Association, which is responsible for preparing the event, is stepping up its work due to the approaching performance date. It specially convened a "Salvation Drama Troupe Benefit Performance Committee" yesterday afternoon at 4:00 to discuss everything. Tickets are divided into five types: three yuan, two yuan, one yuan, five dimes, and two and a half dimes, and have also been distributed for sale. All sectors have a high belief in the troupe, and since the matter is to raise funds for disaster relief, the sale of tickets will surely proceed smoothly. It is heard that the troupe will leave the country immediately after the performance. The period in Hong Kong is approaching, and in order to seek guidance widely and thank all parties for their kind intentions, a tea party will be held at 3:00 p.m. today on the second floor of the Astor Hotel to invite celebrities from all walks of life, as well as the press, education, and theater to attend and provide guidance. A grand occasion is expected. It is also heard that the troupe has compiled a special publication for the performance, with extremely wonderful content, which has now been sent to the printers and will be published during the performance.</p>
<h3>Increasing Water Supply in Hong Kong: Submarine Water Pipes Near Completion; Can Temporarily Increase Water Supply by One Million Gallons; Will Increase to Sixteen Million Gallons in the Future</h3>
<p>In order to increase the amount of water supplied to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Water Authority has added a submarine water pipe to transport water stored in the Shing Mun Reservoir to Hong Kong. The project began in November last year and has been underway for several months. The completion date is not far away. The last few sections of the water pipes were also installed in the sea in front of the Queen's Pier yesterday. After the new pipe is installed, the amount of water supplied to Hong Kong Island from the Shing Mun Reservoir will increase compared to before. The old pipe supplied 8 million gallons of water per day to Hong Kong Island from the Shing Mun Reservoir. The new pipe will temporarily increase the supply by 1 million gallons. Once the second new main pipe is installed in the Kowloon Peninsula, it can be increased to 16 million gallons. The new main pipe has now been installed to Waterloo Road, where the water source will be connected. The Public Works Department engineers encountered many difficulties during the installation of the new submarine water pipe. When it was placed in the middle of Hong Kong Harbour, the project was suspended from time to time due to the rapid currents. Work could only be carried out when the flow slowed down. However, the difficulty of this project lies in connecting each section of the water pipe, ensuring that the two ends fit together perfectly. For this reason, the engineers used an installation machine for accurate measurement. This makes it easier for the coppersmiths to work. The inside diameter of the water pipe is 21 inches, and the old ones are only 12 or 18 inches. The inside of the pipe is attached with a layer of cement concrete, half an inch thick, to prevent corrosion. The outside is also attached with two and a half inches of cement concrete to prevent corrosion and damage from seawater and other causes. Each section of the water pipe is 55 feet long, and each two sections are connected with an extensible joint. After each section is connected, it is tested with a pressure of 300 pounds to see if it is properly connected. In addition, the project still has to connect to the Queen's Pier and the Kowloon Station underground. Once the work is completed in these two locations, the water supply to Hong Kong from the Kowloon Reservoir will be very abundant.</p>

Taking advantage of Mr. Ouyang's birthday today, in addition to paying our highest national tribute to Mr. Ouyang and wishing him eternal youth, we should provide some suggestions from the standpoint of a journalist as a birthday gift:</p>
<p>1. The united front and common development of the drama community is an urgent task at present. Even if some people do not have common beliefs or mutual trust, this is an inevitable transitional phenomenon. It is hoped that Mr. Ouyang will continue to work hard and lead it well.</p>
<p>2. It is hoped that under the leadership of Mr. Ouyang, "Chinese Art" will carry out more meaningful and other salvation work in addition to salvation dramas, which will surely have greater success and greater effect. "Even eating and love are related to the invasion of the enemy." Mr. Lu Xun's statement is not wrong in our common experience.</p>
<p>3. The members of the Chinese Art Troupe, who have been trained for many years, are quite skilled in acting. It is hoped that Mr. Ouyang will lead them to go further and shoulder greater tasks of the times in all aspects more substantively and strongly.</p>
<h3>Landlords are Again Forcing Tenants to Install Water Meters Themselves: Using Water Meters as a Means to Exploit Housing and Increase Rent</h3>
<p>Some landlords in Hong Kong, fearing the extension of the anti-eviction ordinance, are again carrying out last year's failed attempt. Before the Hong Kong government implemented the ice fee regulations on January 1st of this year, landlords took the opportunity to force tenants to install their own water meters under the pretext of complying with government regulations. Later, the authorities learned about this and promulgated an emergency ordinance, stating that if tenants were forced by landlords and not of their own free will, the Water Authority would reject their request. After the ordinance was implemented, the landlords had to comply. Recently, the landlords have not given up on this matter and have even consulted several times. The initial method is to ask the government to remove the existing water meters, and automatically reduce the rent, so that the tenants can install the water meters themselves and pay the water bills. The main purpose of the landlords is to earn an extra ten yuan in rent per water meter per year, and at the same time, they can get the deposit back. Secondly, there is a current shortage of housing. If the method is implemented, tenants will have to install their own water meters at a cost of sixty yuan (including the deposit, labor, and materials). Once installed, it will be difficult to move. At that time, the water meter can be used to exploit the tenants. If the tenant does not want to dismantle the meter when moving out and suffer losses, the landlord can take advantage of the situation and ask the tenant to find a replacement, and then rent it to a new tenant with high-sounding reasons and increase the rent again. Based on the above two points, it is no wonder that the landlords, who value money as their lives, disregard the suffering of the residents and act recklessly.</p>

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Nanhua Singing Class</h3>
<p>— Falling Sunset</p>
<p>The Third Session Was Born Last Night</p>
<p>"Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!" The roar of the Chinese nation echoes in every corner, inspiring every decadent person! Song, a majestic song, is like the bayonet in the hand of the soldiers at the front, a sharp weapon. In Hong Kong, the person in charge of the entertainment department of the Nanhua Sports Association has, in the midst of hardship, created a patriotic singing class. Gathering hundreds of excellent young people, he uses their weapon—song—to defeat the shameless collaborators. Now, this singing class has grown to be three years old. Although the number of people in the first session was only about one hundred, under everyone's hard work and training, the results were very excellent. They had participated in various charitable fundraising public performances and received very positive reviews. So, in the second session, the number increased to over three hundred, and the situation became even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the night of the birth of the third session of the singing class. In a wide hall, a group of lively young people gathered together, talking and laughing, filling the hall with joyful smiles. When the silver whistle blew, everyone quietly returned to their seats. The solemn national anthem filled the hall. The chairman gave a brief report on the history of the singing class, followed by a lighthearted introduction ceremony. The chairman, the secretary… one by one, the young people ran to the stage with smiles, gave a ninety-degree bow, and paid their respects to everyone. Then, the majestic song rose again. Mr. Zheng Guoping, the instructor of the Guangzhou Anti-______ Mobilization Committee, appeared with a smile and gave a stern speech, followed by another song.</p>
<p>Participating in the opening ceremony of the Nanhua Singing Class, we deeply feel the greatness of song and the admirable qualities of the person in charge of this singing class. However, starting a business is difficult. In Hong Kong, training a group of young people far from the front lines is certainly a difficult task. Therefore, everyone should work hard to overcome all difficulties!</p>

The embankment was relatively prosperous. Most of the streets were deserted. Public buses and private cars were rare. The only vehicles running on the road were Japanese military vehicles, shuttling back and forth busily. At street intersections, there were often many Japanese soldiers, searching pedestrians in groups. Every few hundred yards, there was a Japanese soldier on sentry duty, with a stern look, making passers-by avoid him. Shamian was also affected, with business being unusually sluggish. Although the stores were open as usual, the staff had been greatly reduced. The Victoria Hotel was deserted, with only the author and his companion as guests. The number of foreigners in Shamian had sharply decreased, from several hundred to only fifty. Prices were the same as in Hong Kong, but fruits and vegetables were surprisingly expensive. Imported goods were no longer available in Guangzhou, and the shops sold Japanese goods. Most of the shops in the city were run by Japanese. Guangzhou has become a dumping ground for Japanese goods.</p>
<p>The financial situation in Guangzhou is extremely chaotic. The Japanese army ordered the citizens to use Japanese military scrip and prohibited the circulation of legal tender. However, most citizens were happy to use legal tender, so legal tender was still circulating in the market, but stores and restaurants run by the Japanese refused to use it. Guangzhou has become a dead city, with desolation everywhere. Few citizens have returned to the city. The exact number of people in Guangzhou is difficult to ascertain. According to a merchant in Shamian, it is estimated to be about 500,000, but another estimate is 150,000. According to a Japanese merchant, it is said that it is no more than 200,000 at most. According to the author's observation, the current population of Guangzhou is about 100,000, mostly from the poor classes. Although some merchants once returned to the city, they soon reopened because the area was unstable, robbers were rampant, and there was no business to be done. Those who were slightly wealthy were unwilling to stay in the dead city to be disturbed. Because the city was unstable, a curfew was announced at night. In fact, the Japanese army was on high alert day and night. There are about 10,000 Japanese soldiers in the city. As for whether or not there were battles taking place in the suburbs, it was difficult to ascertain. According to a Japanese military officer who spoke to the author, there were no battles within 30 miles of Guangzhou, but two days ago, Shamian still heard clear artillery fire. While the author was staying in Guangzhou, he often saw Japanese military vehicles carrying large numbers of wounded Japanese soldiers back to the city.</p>
<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin Receives Threats While Filming His New Film "The Dictator". Employs Special Guards for Rotation. Decides Not to Waver from His Original Intention and Works Hard to Proceed.</h3>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, the giant of screen comedy, is making his new sound film, "The Dictator," the content of which, as everyone knows, is a satire of a certain dictator. He emphasizes the stupidity and absurdity of certain barbaric and unreasonable political phenomena in the current world situation and brings them to the screen in the form of comedy.</p>
<p>Striking the soul of those people before the world, of course, will make a certain kind of person feel angry and threatened, and therefore use their consistent rogue methods against Chaplin—threats—murder.</p>
<p>"The Dictator" has already started filming and is currently being actively produced. However, since it was decided to film this film, Chaplin has received countless threatening letters, mostly saying that "The Dictator" contains "defamatory" meanings, and demanding that he stop filming immediately, otherwise they will use terrorist methods to "put Chaplin to death." In order to prevent being murdered, Chaplin has recently hired an armed bodyguard who stays close to him to protect him day and night. Special detectives are also sent to monitor him while he eats his three meals a day to prevent bad people from poisoning him. At the same time, during the filming of the film, the surroundings of the studio are also guarded, and the situation is quite serious. However, it is said that although Chaplin has been threatened by the terrorists, his original intention has not wavered in the slightest. On the contrary, the production of "The Dictator" is currently being actively intensified, day and night, in order to present "this ridiculous comedy to the world's forward-thinking people" in the shortest possible time. According to Hollywood filmmakers, it is unprecedented in film history to be so heavily guarded, as if they were important figures in the political world.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Movie Star Representative Works</h3>
<p>— Continued</p>
<p>Spencer Tracy, speaking of "Captains Courageous," it is even stronger than "Boy's Town" (this film has not yet been released in Hong Kong). It's just that Spencer Tracy plays a jovial father, and it's still felt that his personality is not very suitable.</p>
<p>Robert Young, "H.M. Pulham, Esq." is often regarded as Robert Young's representative work.</p>
<p>Nelson Eddy, with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald's collaboration, "Maytime" is considered the most splendid.</p>
<p>Herbert Marshall, Herbert's "Trouble in Paradise" is also the best work of the newcomer Simone Simon.</p>
<p>Bruce Cabot, Bruce's "Suicide Squad" and "Sinners in Paradise" are indeed better than "Letty Lynton" and "Ann Vickers."</p>
<p>Dick Powell, Dick's works are difficult to distinguish. If strictly compared, then "Gold Diggers of 1935," co-starring with Alice Faye and Madelyn Carroll, is the most vivid.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby, Bing's song films are also difficult to compare. "Double or Nothing" seems to be the best recent work. (To be continued)</p>
<p>George Raft, George has also been less in the news recently. "Souls at Sea" is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Charles Laughton's "Ruggles of Red Gap," which is a purely dramatic performance, is Charles Laughton's only successful work.</p>
<p>George Arliss, George may have become a retired actor. However, "The House of Rothschild" is indeed a successful work.</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson, Edward's "Five Star Final," "Little Caesar," etc., are all famous works. "I Am the Law" is more vivid.</p>
<p>Ronald Colman, "A Tale of Two Cities" can be called his representative work. If there is an acting, the result will definitely be a failure.</p>
<p>Warner Baxter, Warner's style is similar to Colman's, and his best film is "The Prisoner of Shark Island."</p>
<p>Basil Rathbone, although John Barrymore and Lionel Atwill have recently been in supporting roles in famous films, their performances are still well received by the audience. John has had two films before, "Of Human Bondage" and "The Mad Genius." In the former, John played a lawyer, and his acting was just right. Lionel's "Dinner at Eight" and his recent film "You Can't Take It With You" are both good.</p>
<p>Leslie Howard, this British artist has two of the best films made in the South—one is "The Scarlet Pimpernel" and the other is "Pygmalion." The latter has not yet been released in Hong Kong. Both films were produced in Britain. "Intermezzo" is often considered his successful performance in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has recently recovered. Although his role in "The Prisoner of Shark Island" is small, he still received good reviews. "The Corsican Brothers" is also a good work.</p>
<p>Robert Donat, Robert's "The Citadel" is rumored to be even better than "The Count of Monte Cristo."</p>
<p>Charles Boyer, "All This, and Heaven Too" is better than "Conquest." His recent "Algiers" is the representative work.</p>
<p>Melvyn Douglas, Melvyn's representative work should be "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," co-starring with Carole Lombard. His performance in "That Uncertain Feeling" is also not bad.</p>
<p>Henry Fonda, "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell" is enough to rival Paul Muni's "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang."</p>
<p>Victor McLaglen, "The Informer" is definitely his representative work.</p>

<p>"I said I would make her like a duchess." As he said that, he excitedly took out a large envelope, "Look, this is an invitation to a dance from the Transylvanian Embassy. I have decided to take her there as a duchess."</p>
<p>The day to leave for the dance was getting closer and closer. Eliza worked hard to learn all the manners and etiquette, and finally that day came quickly. Higgins scratched his messy hair and said to Eliza, "Let's practice one more time."</p>
<p>She was extremely tired, covered her face with her hands, and said disappointedly, "I—I can't do it."</p>
<p>Although there were many things in the embassy's magnificent ballroom that were worth being interested in, Higgins stood absentmindedly next to Pickering, because he was uneasily stepping onto the key to success and failure, worried about the outcome. He had just seen a face that dispelled his hopes. This man now walked over, a smile on his face, and said,</p>
<p>"Professor Higgins, do you remember me? I am Alex Carbotti. You taught me phonetics. You can point out where a person was born in England, but I can point out where they were born in Europe. I am your best student."</p>
<p>Higgins knew that the man indeed had the same ability as himself. After the man left, he told Pickering, "If he hears Eliza, I'm done."</p>
<p>"I want a better job," he continued. "But because my accent is wrong, people don't want me. Can you help me?"</p>

<h3>South China Football Team to Play Charity Match with Joint Team Today. Hui Tang of South China and Da Gao of Joint Team to Compete. South China to Play Friendly Match with Foreign Sailors Tomorrow.</h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The South China Athletic Association's football team, in the 1928-29 season, established a glorious achievement that will benefit future generations. It is truly rare and will be forever immortalized.</p>
<p>However, although their players have the glory of winning championships, they still do not consider this to be satisfactory. For learning is endless, and diligence leads to success. Recently, in response to an invitation from the Nanyang region, they are making an expedition again, departing on the 24th of this month on the French postal ship Bodume.</p>
<p>Even on the eve of departure, they are still generous. The South China touring team, at the invitation of the association's emergency work service corps, will play a charity match with the joint team at Caroline Hill at 5:15 pm today. This move is both for the sake of the compatriots in distress and also an opportunity to practice fully in preparation for the tour of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Today's tickets are divided into three types: one dollar, sixty cents, and thirty cents. However, viewers must not buy them outside the stadium, because fake tickets have recently appeared. Please do not be fooled.</p>
<p>Tomorrow at 5:15 pm, the touring team has also arranged a friendly match with the sailors of the British warship HMS Gannet, also at Caroline Hill. The ticket prices may be cheaper than today.</p>
<p>After the football season ends, many players go into seclusion. Therefore, although today's lineup for the joint team is arranged by the association, the South China Athletic Association first sought the consent of each member, who all agreed to contribute to the charity. This is how it can be realized. Since they have agreed to play, it is believed that they will not back down at the last minute.</p>
<p>The lineup for the joint team was announced the day before yesterday and looks exceptionally complete. The forward line has Da Gao, Shan Nu, Hou Chengtuo, Tuo Ban, etc., all first-class players, and their attacking power will definitely be sharp. The defense has Gu Ba, Xu Jingcheng, Hou Rongheng, Shi Han, etc., who are also well-known figures. If they all work together, it will definitely be pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>The lineup for South China was only decided yesterday afternoon, showing a completely new look. In particular, the forward line has been positioned to suit each individual's abilities, and there is no longer the disadvantage of forcing people into positions they are not suited for. Moreover, in addition to the two wings being fixed, the three forwards can mutually adjust their positions when necessary, because all three forwards are suitable for both left and right, and can perform as desired in any position. This is the characteristic of today's forward line.</p>
<p>Some people say, "In exhibition matches that have no championship implications, the performances are never very intense." This situation may exist, but it is not necessarily the case. Because the two teams become enemies when they face each other. All who are involved in the battle will undoubtedly have the mentality of doing their best and striving for victory. Especially when the teams are evenly matched, the competition is even fiercer. They will not abandon their goal of achieving victory simply because there is no championship involved. It is believed that today these two teams, precisely because they are evenly matched, will have the ambition to not give in easily and will have the most exciting performances.

<h3>Second Division Basketball Rescheduling Order There are three games tonight</h3>
<p>The various games of this year's Open Men's Basketball Second Division League, which were postponed due to previous events, have now been rescheduled by the League as follows:</p>
<h3>School Volleyball Competition Wah Yan forfeits, Pui Ying wins without effort There are six games today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's scheduled School Volleyball Competition originally included three games at the senior, junior, and children's levels. However, when the senior Wah Yan vs. Pui Ying game came, Wah Yan was nowhere to be seen, so the referee ruled that Wah Yan had forfeited and Pui Ying had won. In the junior Wah Yan vs. Yu Cai game, Wah Yan's middle and rear rows were not perfect, with many misunderstandings, while the front row was more balanced. Yu Cai's side was unified, with the front and middle rows able to respond to each other, while the back row was slightly weaker. However, the overall coordination was very good and the entire line was stable, so Wah Yan was defeated zero to three. The first game was 21-9, the second game was 21-12, and the third game was 21-7.</p>
<p>In the children's grade, Fang Zhong vs. Ying Huang, Fang Zhong's entire army was quite strong in combat, and their attack and defense were consistent, so they won three to zero. The first game was 21-17, the second game was 21-2, and the third game was 21-13. Today, there are two games in each grade. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Senior, Blake Garden Court</p>

<h3>Forging Football Tickets Defendant Guilty Fined or Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Xu Ruifen, a teenager, 18 years old, was charged with selling four forged South China Athletic Association tickets at Caroline Hill on the 17th of this month. The case was heard yesterday morning by the Central Patrol Court. The case was prosecuted by English detective Jia Shiman. It was stated that the final battle for the Xuhe Cup was held at the South China Stadium at 5:15 pm on the 17th of this month. At that time, many people from all walks of life bought tickets to enter the stadium. At that time, the defendant was holding four South China Athletic Association fifty-cent tickets and selling them to people. He charged sixty cents for each ticket. Later, a person named Ou Yaoliang, without realizing it, bought the ticket from the defendant. When he held the ticket to enter the stadium, the gatekeeper discovered that it was a fake ticket. The official asked the defendant where he printed this kind of fake ticket. The defendant said that this kind of fake ticket was printed at a printing office at a certain number on Luoke Road. English detective Jia Shiman then stated to the official that when the police obtained the defendant's confession, they had already sent personnel to investigate the printing office, but the office did not have this kind of fake ticket. The official sentenced the defendant to a fine of fifty yuan or two months in prison.</p>

<h3>Current Students' Reforms for Physical Training Should Have (3)</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>Gymnastics has always been criticized as being rigid and boring, and the amount of exercise is minimal. Students who only value freedom will not even bother to look at it. However, it has special value: the difficulty is profound, the boundaries are clear, and the old, young, strong, and weak can all do it; it is symmetrical on the left and right, and comprehensive on the top and bottom, and all parts of the body can benefit; it does not choose time and place, and does not limit the number of people, and can be done anytime and anywhere; and its main feature is that it does not require a small amount of money, and it is the basic exercise of all sports.</p>
<p>Activated apparatus gymnastics is an exercise that most people think is too difficult to do, but movements such as vaulting over the pommel horse and side horse and releasing the hand on the uneven bars can foster a spirit of boldness, carefulness, bravery, and adventure; exercises on the mat, such as handstands, single and double swings, rotations, etc., can cultivate a sense of response to obvious rotations and rapid ascents and descents in aviation technology; and the dexterity and agility of the movements can also cultivate the ability to cope with ease when fighting on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Guoshu (Chinese martial arts) is a traditional method of body training in our country for thousands of years. The subtlety of its movements and the mystery of its changes are its unique functions. Although modern warfare relies on airplanes and cannons, when it comes to charging and hand-to-hand combat, Guoshu can show great power. In the past war of resistance, there were countless glorious battles in which the power of Guoshu was used to kill enemies.</p>
<p>Military sports, such as climbing, crossing obstacles, jumping over obstacles, climbing mountains, rolling forward, and throwing hand grenades, not only can be directly applied in the event of a battle, achieving the effect of being able to handle things with ease, command freely, and kill enemies; but also is a sport that is rich in naturalness, and we can use it as a substitute for track and field.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned sports have not been completely covered, they have given an outline. We can choose and follow them according to the current needs of sports rehabilitation, and considering the performance of various sports. Students can also understand the reforms needed for physical training materials.</p>
<p>3. Reform of practice methods: Exercise can strengthen the body, and whether the effect can be achieved quickly depends on whether the practice method is appropriate. If the practice method is appropriate, there is no need to be timid and look around, and the work done will not be in vain at all; otherwise, hesitating and hesitating will inevitably lead to futile efforts.</p>
<p>Economic Column</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities; Changes in the Domestic Economic Environment; The Abnormal Prosperity of the Shanghai Market Should Not Be Overly Optimistic; Development of the Southwest Economy Depends on Transportation Construction; Annual Report of Rising Banks</h3>
<p>The annual report of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for the 27th year of the Republic [1938] stated: Due to the spread of war, the domestic economic situation this year has suffered unprecedented misfortune, and the losses have been the heaviest in our country's history. Moreover, due to the different impacts of the war on various regions, various abnormal phenomena have occurred. In general, both production and consumption have declined. As for the economic situation abroad, the situations in various countries vary greatly due to different environments and policies, but signs of recession seem to be more prevalent. The following is a summary of the domestic economic situation, divided into finance, trade, prices, and industry and commerce:</p>
<p>Finance: Following the financial panic of last autumn, the "Regulations for Stabilizing Finance" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance continued to be implemented. The Discount and Loan Committee organized by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China also successively handled discount and loan matters in various regions. In addition, the government was determined to maintain the legal tender, and the governments and financial institutions of friendly countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States also provided assistance when appropriate. Therefore, although the war situation deteriorated day by day, the financial market was able to remain stable as usual. Not only was there no run on banks, but a large amount of previously fled capital also returned. Except for a few small banks, no financial institutions went bankrupt. The Shanghai interbank lending rate did not fluctuate abnormally throughout the year, and even the unofficial market for government bonds rose steadily. All of this was beyond our expectations and is gratifying. In this relatively stable situation, there were also some important events that deserve our attention, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Black Market for Foreign Exchange: At the beginning of this year, the government continued to strive to maintain the statutory exchange rate. Later, due to environmental factors, on March 14, the "Measures for Foreign Exchange Application and Verification" were promulgated, stipulating that when banks needed foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting receipts and payments, they could apply to the Central Bank for purchase. After approval by the Central Bank, foreign exchange was sold at the statutory price, so as to appropriately limit the supply of foreign exchange. In June, regulations were successively issued to restrict the types of imported goods, and foreign exchange from exported goods should also be sold to national banks. On August 8, it was stipulated that applications for foreign exchange for goods shipped for import after January 1 of this year would no longer be accepted, except for necessities. The market's demand for foreign exchange could not be fully satisfied, and the so-called "black market" arose accordingly. The unofficial exchange rate of legal tender gradually declined from one shilling two and a half pence, reaching a low of seven pence eight seven five in August. However, since the second half of the year, the exchange rate in this black market has often hovered above eight pence. After the establishment of British and American loans, it became even more stable. It can be seen that the value of legal tender, even under the manipulation of the black market, can still maintain a considerable degree of stability.</p>
<p>Transfer Draft Discount: Shanghai's transfer drafts were originally scheduled to be cashed the next day. However, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance," the so-called interbank transfer drafts could only be used for transfers and could not be cashed, nor could they be used to purchase foreign exchange. Since its use was restricted, a discount method arose when it was exchanged for cash. This had already shown signs in the second half of last year, and this year it became even more intensified. Later, the Joint Reserve Board stepped in to maintain it and injected a large amount of funds, and it was then calmed down. By the end of this year, the amount of legal tender in the market had increased considerably, and the transfer draft discount had tended to decrease. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai financial market has added a new type of fund. Customers often have to open two accounts, one for legal tender and one for transfer drafts, which is also an abnormal phenomenon of wartime finance. This year, the war gradually moved westward, and transportation between Shanghai and the interior became increasingly inconvenient. Before and during the war, the quantity of goods from Shanghai to the interior was quite large, while it was not easy to transport a large amount of local goods out of the interior and they were controlled by the government. The amount of funds remitted from the interior to Shanghai far exceeded the amount remitted from Shanghai to the interior, so the exchange rate became increasingly high, and there was the pain of not being able to adjust the exchange rate anywhere. In addition, the exchange rate between Shanghai and various ports in North China was also quite chaotic, so it was not easy for funds in various regions to support each other, which was also affected by the war.</p>
<p>Shanghai Capital: Since the war in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, the number of people from the interior who came to Shanghai to seek refuge has increased day by day, and a large amount of capital from the war zone has flowed in. Moreover, a considerable amount of capital that purchased foreign exchange before and during the war has returned due to the accumulation of interest. Therefore, Shanghai's capital has gradually become abundant, and the current deposits of financial institutions have increased considerably. The market funds have become increasingly loose, and speculative activities have followed, from the buying and selling of foreign currencies, gold, and stocks to the hoarding of various commodities, which is even more prosperous than before the war. Using funds for unproductive purposes cannot but be regarded as a wartime economic worry.</p>
<p>Southwest Finance: After the government moved westward, the economic development of the Southwest cannot be delayed. In order to meet the needs of people in the interior, the major financial institutions in Shanghai have opened branches in important locations in various provinces in the Southwest, and the number has increased day by day. Many financial institutions in the war zone have also retreated to the Southwest with the government, and people's capital has gradually moved in to be used for local production enterprises. At present, Shanghai's capital lacks investment opportunities. If it can be transferred to the interior under safe principles, it will undoubtedly contribute to the economic development of the Southwest. All of the above are characteristics of wartime finance this year. Although it is not entirely satisfactory, if we understand the seriousness of this war and the vastness of its spread, we must regard the stability of the financial situation this year as a rare phenomenon. The government's efforts to protect the currency, ensure financial security, and maintain credit, as well as the cooperative assistance of friendly financial institutions, have all made great contributions.</p>

<h3>Share Market Remains Firm; Investors Do Not Easily Sell Their Stocks</h3>

Even if price drops are encountered occasionally, they can be tolerated and observed quietly. Therefore, during this week, sellers have not乱抛 stocks, while buyers have occasionally expressed interest in absorbing stocks. Unfortunately, investors' asking prices are too high, resulting in limited transactions. Currently, the market is generally firm until closing.

<h3>The Dr. Shang Zhongyi That I Know</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Zexuan</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong is unfortunate, suffering cruel trampling. Educators who have left us have already been three in succession. Among the three, the death of Dr. Shang Zhongyi is the most sudden. However, among the three, my relationship with Shang is the deepest. Twenty years ago, when I went abroad, Shang was still studying at the Tsinghua Secondary Vocational School, and I did not know him. Fifteen years ago, when I returned to China to teach at Tsinghua, Shang was about to graduate. At that time, I also served as a career guidance officer. I knew that he was enthusiastic about social service and strongly urged him to study education. Shang also wanted to enter Peabody College for Teachers at Vanderbilt University. Peabody is a well-known normal college located in the southern United States, as famous as Columbia and Chicago. Previously, no Chinese students had gone there. After Shang entered, he received a warm welcome from the local people and teachers and students in the school. Later, Shang went to Columbia Teachers College and obtained a doctorate.</p>
<p>Six years ago, I went to Hangzhou to teach at Zhejiang University, while Shang was at the Zhejiang Changmiao People's Education Experimental School, training many teachers for the people. I met Mr. Meng Lin in Guling and learned that Peking University needed educational talents, so I sought Shang's consent. At that time, Shang had married Ms. Wang Lifang, a Tsinghua classmate and sister of Guijun, who specialized in music in the United States. The husband followed the wife in singing, which was extremely happy.</p>
<p>A year ago, when I fled to Guangdong due to the war, Shang was the acting director of the Education Research Institute of Zhongshan University, striving to promote wartime education. Before long, Mr. Zaiyang returned from overseas investigation. Brothers Zhu Youguang and Zeng Zhaosen hosted several banquets for Mr. Zaiyang at the Lingnan Reception Room, and Shang and I were both present. I remember that there was a tense debate on a certain issue. Later, General Wo Qi heard of Shang's name and invited him to join the Political Department. Shang worked diligently day and night, and was uncompromising in the face of danger. When Guangzhou was evacuated, Shang sent his family to Guilin so that he could concentrate on his work. Initially, I did not expect that Guangzhou would fall and Guilin would be bombed. Shang went north with the army, while Madam Shang and her children came to Hong Kong via an indirect route.</p>
<p>This time, Shang was planning to take a car from Shao through Shantou to Hong Kong, but the car encountered an unexpected disaster near Shunning. Everyone else was slightly injured, but Shang died in the line of duty. Alas, why does Heaven rob us of educators more than those in other professions? Shang was in the prime of his life. With more time, his contributions to education would not have been limited to what he had already accomplished. We are already familiar with Shang's contributions to wartime education. If his leadership is desired for postwar educational facilities but cannot be obtained, wouldn't that be a great loss to the future of the country and the nation!</p>
<h3>Encounter</h3>
<p>— Sun Zhenshi</p>
<p>After a round of poisonous interrogation, he was taken by several burly men into this dark iron prison. It was so narrow and suffocating, crowded with a large group of people. As soon as he entered, he almost tripped over a foot that was sticking out. Feeling his way forward, he sat down in the gap between people. He felt his brain expanding desperately, and every pore on his skin was exploding. A burst of soreness, a burst of numbness, he clenched his teeth subconsciously; his eyes gradually blurred and darkened, the world seemed to be spinning, and finally, he fainted.</p>
<p>A burst of intense pain woke him up again. Looking around, it was still pitch black. Some voices were groaning softly. A vague shadow flashed through his mind, and he silently sank into his memories.</p>
<p>One noon, he was about to walk out of the office when Captain Wang Zhongwen rushed over and whispered to him:</p>
<p>"Jin Gang, there is another task for you now. If you succeed, we will be even stronger."</p>
<p>"What is it?" He looked at Captain Wang.</p>
<p>Captain Wang immediately put his mouth close to his ear:</p>
<p>"Although we now have hundreds of comrades, we only have thirty or forty firearms. Under the paving in front of the ×× Elementary School gate in Town C, there are more than fifty short guns buried. They were left behind when the army retreated before. Now we are sending you to find a way to transport them out. As for how to transport them, you will have to see how things go when you get there." Captain Wang raised his head, looked at the blue sky, and continued quickly: "You must go tonight, it's good that you are familiar with the situation in the town."</p>
<p>So, in the twilight, he arrived in Town C and lodged in the home of an acquaintance. He began his activities.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, he led a group of enthusiastic young porters and sneaked into the uninhabited school at night, starting a difficult job. The river water beside the paving was flashing with black light in the dark night. A fishing boat was quietly waiting, urging them to work harder.</p>
<p>Using the light of the moon and stars, they dug and dug in the dark night. The soil was dug up several feet high, and a wide wooden board was discovered. It was said that under this, a pile of dark guns were buried. Countless eyes began to reveal waves of joy and happiness, and they used all their strength to tie the guns together and move them to the fishing boat parked by the river. The partners waiting on the fishing boat loaded the guns onto the boat and covered them with cloth.</p>
<p>The fishing boat began to move in the river, reflecting in the light of the stars and moon. The outline of the town was dreaming in a sweet sleep.</p>
<p>The surroundings were silent, and a sound of oars came from across the river. Before long, several strong beams of light shone on the boat, and a violent voice shouted: "What are you doing? Don't move!" Before the partners could put up a fight, the other side jumped over to the boat. So Jin Gang and his partners were taken to the pseudo-police station in a series. Before the interrogation, they were beaten severely by the yellow-clothed men stationed in the pseudo-police station. Fresh red blood burst out of their red skin, turning into a brownish-purple narrow brand on their bodies. After the beating, they were taken one by one to the interrogation room. Several hideous yellow-clothed men and puppet officials were sitting high above, revealing contemptuous sneers.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to confess?" The voice from above floated in the air. Jin Gang was still standing calmly and solemnly, silently pondering. After a while, the side door of the interrogation room was lightly pushed open, and a young man in plain clothes came out casually, and saw Jin Gang, pretending to be surprised!</p>
<p>"Oh, it's Brother Jin Gang! What crime have you committed?"</p>
<p>He looked up and standing in front of him was Yang Yimin, a former classmate.</p>
<p>"Brother Jin Gang, joined the guerrillas? Haha - what a boring thing -"</p>
<p>Countless sparks burst out in Jin Gang's eyes. Before Yang Yimin finished speaking, he rushed towards him in one breath, and Yang Yimin was caught off guard and somersaulted.</p>
<p>After that, Jin Gang was dragged down and beaten severely by several burly men, fainting and waking up, waking up and fainting again, fainting and waking up several times. His whole body was red and swollen. In this way, he was pushed into this iron prison.</p>
<p>He missed the young porters and boatmen, and also missed his many comrades. In this way, he endured in prison, suffering hardships, waiting for an opportunity to break through the wall and fly away.</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Ma Yufeng</p>
<p>Farmers are used to getting up early,</p>
<p>The sky is only slightly bright,</p>
<p>Someone is walking on the porch,</p>
<p>Followed by the sound of opening the door.</p>
<p>Mother starts a fire in the kitchen</p>
<p>And tells her younger sister,</p>
<p>To carry buckets to inspect the round fields,</p>
<p>The outdoors is hazy.</p>
<h3>Prisoner</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The waning moon hangs on the government, accompanying us all the way. When the sun rises, we have already traveled twenty miles.</p>
<p>The roadside is full of places passed by the × army. In the villages on the west bank of the Fen River, there is not a single person's shadow.</p>
<p>We can no longer see the smoke rising from the chimneys in the morning, and we feel a continuous desolation in our hearts.</p>
<p>Dogs wandered on the roadside, licking the blood on the ground. In the distance, we saw the highway winding down from the mountain. Our alert troops were all over our heads.</p>
<p>Clap! Clap! Clap! It rang continuously.</p>
<p>As we passed the highway, four enemies fixed on this side of the highway from the village next to the highway.</p>
<p>We greeted them, and the quick gun rang loudly, and a Japanese soldier fell down.</p>
<p>"Surrender your guns, don't kill, treat you well!" The propagandist shouted slogans in Japanese, and our ranks continued to move forward</p>
<p>The other three Japanese soldiers ran to the village in front. Our soldiers, who were chasing closely behind, also shouted in Japanese.</p>
<p>We are the Eighth Route Army, we treat prisoners well.</p>
<p>Three living Japanese soldiers were disarmed.</p>
<p>I asked them: "Why are you deceived by the fascist warlords and come to China to be cannon fodder?"</p>
<p>They lowered their heads for a long time and did not speak.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of them spoke, his voice a little excited.</p>
<p>"We are fighting for the peace of East Asia, not for aggression."</p>
<p>I asked again:</p>
<p>"Fighting for peace, why come to China to forcibly occupy Chinese land, kill Chinese people, rape Chinese women, ...</p>
<p>He said, "Because China cannot understand."</p>
<p>I was a little angry and asked:</p>
<p>"What do you want us to understand?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what the government of my country thinks."</p>
<p>The political officer told them our proposition. He said, "We do not hate the Japanese people, we only want to overthrow the Japanese fascist warlords; most Japanese people are suffering just like us. We - Chinese and Japanese, should unite to attack the fascist bandits and relieve our own suffering.</p>
<p>They expressed their approval of the political officer's talk</p>
<p>The political officer's attitude was so sincere and sincere that it could really move people</p>
<p>Later, he said to them again: "If you come to China, you will never be able to go back, and your parents and wives at home will be thinking of you every day: If you come to China, you will not benefit!"</p>
<p>"Even if my family thinks of me, they will want to die!"</p>
<p>Tears came from the eyes of the three foreigners.</p>
<p>A cannon shot from Nanguan was very violent; so our political officer led a battalion of people to the mountains on both sides of the highway between Guangjiugu and Taohuapo. Prepare to intercept the passing motorcade.</p>
<h3>The Solitary Walk</h3>
<p>— Grass on the Wall</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed walking. When I say enjoy, it's not because I agree with hygiene enthusiasts that it's a beneficial physical and mental exercise. Actually, it's because I have too much free time; when I'm happy, I just wander around, and slowly it becomes a habit. When people develop a habit, they often do it unconsciously and automatically. For me, walking is a good example.</p>
<p>Most of my walks take place late at night, because during the day, there are too many vehicles on the street, and the crowds are relatively dense. As vehicles pass, they stir up dust, which goes straight into my nose, making it difficult to breathe. At night—or even at dusk—the soldiers and police are fewer, and the crowds are sparse. This allows me to walk freely without bumping into someone's shoulder, or having someone step on my shoes, which would make my leisurely mood anxious and violate the original purpose of walking.</p>
<p>I don't like walking with a large group of people, because the pleasure it offers is no longer based on walking. Even on a small scale, the different paces of each person can create a lot of trouble in the mind. However, I do enjoy walking with two people, as long as the other person truly understands the pleasure of walking. But, in reality, I am often alone, just me by myself.</p>
<p>Therefore, I laugh at myself as a solitary walker.</p>
<p>Because I have walked so much, I am familiar with so many streets suitable for walking, most of which are relatively quiet but not deserted. I walk slowly on them, always muttering something like a masterpiece of a poem. In fact, I often don't think about anything. I pay no attention to the things around me; or I feel something, I perceive something. I think I belong to another world, and at the same time, I think that world belongs exclusively to me. But when I realize that my body is actually in the human world, in the ordinary hustle and bustle, I have overlooked things? I calmly want to emphasize my observation to discover the fun in them. I will stop under dazzling neon lights, moving my gaze and silently enjoying the colors and structural beauty of various goods. I will follow behind graceful women to satisfy my sensory comfort. Yes, I also feel such loneliness, so I often urgently want to meet an acquaintance. Even if it's someone I've only met briefly, I'll greet them, cast a joyful glance, and of course, I need a sincere handshake and a heart-to-heart conversation, which will warm my soul.</p>
<p>But the streets are like the ocean, and in the vast ocean, I am unfamiliar with the crowds.</p>
<p>The night is deep, and people have already gone to sleep. On this street, there is only me.</p>
<p>I look at the stars in the sky. I think with a sense of gain and loss, like a philosopher trying to understand the secrets of the universe.</p>
<p>Friend, do you want to ask me what I'm thinking about?</p>
<p>I tell you, I miss the suburbs. How wonderful it would be to take a solitary walk in the suburbs. I want to go to the suburbs.</p>
<h3>Snow on the Ground</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>As soon as the maid saw him, she immediately closed her mouth and shivered: she was like a lit candle, gradually melting away. She didn't dare to speak, only giving the detective some hints, as if to say:</p>
<p>"That guy, he's the bandit!"</p>
<p>So, the detective immediately pulled out his gun and watched Yu Wen. At this time, the maid slowly hugged Zhu Lin and dared to speak:</p>
<p>"Can't you see it's him?"</p>
<p>Zhu Lin was smart. She said:</p>
<p>"Are you crazy? Didn't he just come with me? Didn't you see him?"</p>
<p>"I saw him! But I just recognized him now! Miss, I remember his eyes, don't you think they're strange?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Miss, who is he?"</p>
<p>"He's my friend!"</p>
<p>The detective's gun was quietly put away again. The maid was bored and lowered her head. In order to avoid the detective's and the maid's suspicion, Zhu Lin deliberately took Yu Wen's arm to show that this person was not to be violated because:</p>
<p>"He's my lover!" However, from the time they met until now, she didn't love him, just as he didn't love her. What he and she loved was the same third party—the country.</p>
<p>The snow has been falling for three days. This heavy snow is common, because it is the snow of Manchuria.</p>
<p>After this parting, she returned to her family and soon moved to a new address; he was soon transferred to another job and went to another place. Because of the changes on both sides, it was impossible to find out their addresses. For five years, all news was cut off. However, in these five years, they often asked their comrades, their friends:</p>
<p>"Do you know Zhu Lin?" and "Do you know Yu Wen?" (The End)</p>
