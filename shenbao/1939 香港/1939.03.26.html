<h3 id="c1">抗戰以來之蒙旗　沙克都爾扎布 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自「七七」事變突發，日×狡焉思逞，妄欲利用其軍事上的威脅，政治上的哄騙，亡我國，滅我種。以達到獨占家亞的侵略野望。我最高當局爲爭求民族生存，領土完整，乃决然發動全民抗戰，進入國民革命的第二階段，迄今已有十九個多月了。在這十九個多月之中，由於我前方將士的英勇效命。全國人民的一心一德，已將×人速戰速决的陰謀粉碎無遺，同時我堅苦抗戰的精神，已博得世界廣大的同情與聲援。我全體國民深知維護國際正義，以及民族生存的責任重大，在最高統帥領導之下，集中全力，以與日×對抗。抗戰以來，×則愈戰愈困，我則愈戰愈強，最近×軍反戰情緒日見高張，國內又因迭次徵兵暴動時起，這些顯明的事實，就是日本法西斯軍閥陷於泥沼中而不能自拔的徵兆，也就是最後勝利終屬於我的保證。</p>
<p>蒙旗同胞基於上述的堅定信念，故自抗戰軍興以來，始終站在自己的崗位上，執行保衛祖國的神聖任務！自然我們也不否認，蒙旗的文化水準太低，一切設備均較落後，但我們蒙人却具有一顆擁護政府擁護領袖，粉碎×人奸計的血心！我們爲了完成抗戰建國的偉大使命，爲了保衛祖宗艱苦締造的光榮基業，從前年冬天起，各蒙旗就展開了廣泛的抗日運動。隨着×人瘋狂的進攻，壓迫的加緊，於是廣大蒙民，陡然的覺醒起來，掀起抗日救國的浪潮，如火燎原般地迅速燃遍了西蒙各旗。在達拉特旗，在準格爾旗，在郡王旗，在扎薩克旗，在伊克昭盟的全境，到處都是荷着槍，騎着馬的游擊戰士，天天都在襲擊×人，繼續不斷地打擊×人，如白海風，韓宇春，馬子禧，乃木黛，奇俊峯，巴雲英等都曾寫下了光榮的抗×史績。</p>
<p>如果我們翻開地圖看一看，就能接觸到蒙古同胞的抗日決心，不是發於偶然的。一方面固然是因了保全我們中華民族領土的完整，但從另一方面觀察，蒙旗同胞的發動抗×能如此其快，如此其普遍深入，主要原因，還在「九一八」事變後，×人以石本失蹤爲藉口，向熱河侵犯，更進佔我多倫，改絃易轍，把蒙人原有的盟制推翻，更名省長，以逐其分割征服的狡計。哲理木，卓索圖，昭烏達呼倫貝爾等四盟部落，就在日×這種陰謀下淪入×手了！後來錫林鄂勒，烏蘭察布兩盟，亦因情勢所迫，已非我有，而今只伊克昭盟尙完整不缺。蒙古同胞在×人的鉄蹄踐踏下，備受蹂躙，所以成千成萬的蒙古民衆，都在抗×的號召之下，充分發揮他們的抗戰力量。</p>
<p>極少數的糊塗虫，雖然受了敵人一時的煽惑，爲虎作倀，像德王個人也是年幼志弱竟受附近少數不識大義的亂臣賊子之流的包圍和嗾使，甘心傲了過渡到×寇直接統治的橋樑！傀儡，無論怎樣的對×人低首獻媚，在×人看來，傀儡們幷不算是人，欲殺便殺，欲打便打，無恥的漢奸們，不知道受了×人多少的齷齪氣。所以有很多近於義憤的份予，紛紛反正，軍隊方面如準噶爾旗韓旅長宇春，達拉特旗馬團長子禧乃木黛等，尤其前數年間由德王保送赴日留學之伊盟靑年奇丕彰華登等數人，亦已激底瞭解德王之勾通日人，不但對民族作孽遺臭，且對個人位置危於旦夕，近來接踵返國，參加神聖抗戰，此足見日×之失敗，不限於軍事一方，其牢攏手段亦已敗露殆盡，現在×人又集中兵力於綏包一帶，企圖西犯。但我們早已算到了他這一着，我們早已把首當其衝的伊盟民衆組織自衛隊游擊隊，前者是不脫離生產的民衆武裝組織，後者是脫離生產的民衆武裝組織。這五萬多生活在沙漠地帶的健兒，過去在綏遠，包頭附近以及達拉特旗，準噶爾旗等處，已予×人好多次嚴重的打擊，他們已訓練成久戰疆場的英勇戰士了，他們雖然沒有新式的武器，但是他們有精練的騎術，有準確的射擊技能，這在抗戰當中，蒙旗游擊隊曾經以敏捷的姿態，機動的戰術，殺傷了數千日本鬼子，消耗了×人的無數彈藥，使×人至今猶不敢輕向蒙旗進犯。國人切記：日×肆其橫暴，猛犯不已，我們臨此民族存亡絕續的關頭，凡有血氣之倫，誰不捨身爲國！蒙旗是整個中華民族的一環，抗×救亡，義無反顧。我們蒙人决不計一切犧牲，在內蒙的荒原中，將配合着總的形勢，協同正規軍，摧殘×人的一切毒計狡謀，葬送×人於沙漠之中！目前我們正致力於充實抗×武力，健全政治機構，齊一步驟，使革命抗戰的空氣瀰漫於每個蒙旗的部落裏，而後抗×工作能日益加強，日見成效，我們的最後勝利也必因了蒙旗抗×工作的堅决和進展而早日實現。　一九三九·二·廿三于重慶</p>
<h3 id="c2">世界動向一週間 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從三月十九日至廿五日</p>
<p>極度動亂的世界，在過去一週間，更顯得空前的緊張和嚴重。一方面是侵略國家的得寸進尺，緊接着捷克的淪亡，又有羅馬尼亞的危機和米美爾的被併；另一方面是和平國家的被迫而團結，因此有英國之考慮改變外交政策，有法國總統的聘問倫敦，及美國政府改組法案的通過。同時，世界和平之衛士的蘇聯，則已圓滿結束其聯共十八屆大會，民主和平陣線獲得更進一步的發展。我們的抗日戰爭，雖然轉向更艱苦更嚴重的階段，然而兩條戰線的鬥爭愈趨明朗，全國團結的情形愈可樂觀，勝利在向我們戰士招手了！</p>
<p>侵略集團猖狂亂舞</p>
<p>法西斯侵略陣綫，仍在瘋狂冒險的發展着。當其冒險推進的時候，德意日相互間的矛盾亦已跟着發展，但是爲了推進新的帝國主義大戰，重新分割世界，所以他們的勾結却更加緊密一致了！</p>
<p>德</p>
<p>德國侵略者，自從上週宣佈併吞捷克以後，一面揮軍東進，以武力帮助外交，奪取羅馬尼亞的經濟利權和糧食油產等富源，使羅國實際上喪失獨立性的『德羅新協定』談判，就在本週宣吿成功了；另一面，德國侵略者又在希特勒的領導下，於本月廿三日淸晨進軍米美爾，立頒佔領令，將米美爾合併歸德了！而上週官佈「獨立」，脫離捷克的斯洛伐克，亦於同日自簽賣身契，與德訂德斯協定，明白規定一切受德支配。至此，德國一週來劫奪結果，人口增加一千萬，領土擴張三萬五千萬里，現在遝想進一步向但澤，丹麥，比利時進攻呢！</p>
<p>意</p>
<p>意大利侵略者，在本週雖無重大發展，然而，他已經由離間西班牙共和政府內部團結開始，於本月廿四日驅策叛軍進兵馬德里了！苦守三年屹然水動的民主的聖城馬德里，竟至淪陷在西政府少數領袖之『中送反共對敵妥協』，這事對於我們，自屬重大的敎訓；今後西班牙求自由的廣大羣衆，在共產黨與社會黨的親密合作下繼續更艱苦的反法西斯反侵略的鬥爭，自是必然的事實，而意大利侵略者未以在西班牙的刼獲為足，亦是事實。只是今後他再要發展，勢必與英法發生止面衝突，而意國本身力量實未足以戰勝英漢，非賴德國帮助不可，因此不得不自願為德奴役，而有本月廿一日意國法西斯最高會議，之决定繼續維護德意軸心對抗民主國聯合陣綫的『威脅』；廿三日德報亦卽表示希特勒將支持意國要求，並祝意國能够不戰而成功！</p>
<p>日</p>
<p>在侵華戰爭中泥足愈陷愈深的日本，當西方同盟者冒險成功之際，自亦急謀利用時機，加緊冒險，同時因爲我國抗戰力量日益增強，蘇聯在遠東的聲威與强硬態度亦是日本的『一大脅威』，而民主和平國家聯合陣綫的聲浪又使日本侵略者痛感前途危險，急謀其新的對策。因此就有本月廿二晚的破例的五相漏夜密會，祖是仍無結果而散，似將繼續會商。至於日×計劃，大致第一是待這次議會閉幕以後，卽將調整內閣，趕走近衛而援引勝田田邊等入閣，以解决財政經濟的困難。第二是更進一步和德意勾結，實現德意日防共協定成爲軍事同盟，在遠東威脅英法；第三是對華實行軍事投機，輔以反共和平等政治陰謀，積極推進華中華南的軍事。急速威逼我國屈服。</p>
<p>民主國家加緊團結</p>
<p>民主和平各國團結起來的呼聲，再沒有像本週這樣震動世界了！而在事實上，鞏固與擴展和平陣綫的運動，也確有極關重要的發展。第一，是英法兩國發覺並承認妥協外交的禍人誤己，必須放棄，而有開始採取積極抵抗法西斯侵略者之步驟的傾向。第二，是美國聯合民主國家反對法西斯以保衛世界和平的政策，愈加堅决與進步。第三，歐洲各小國再度表示祗要英法等確有團結抵抗法西斯的决心，各小國决定盡一切力量加以支持。現在試看各國動態：</p>
<p>英</p>
<p>英國政府鑿於德國毀棄墨瀋未乾的慕尼黑協定而實行併吞捷克，歐洲特成法西斯獨霸的世界，而大英帝國的地位將受到重大的威脅，所以也不得不採取聯合民主國家抵抗法西斯的政策。如聲明不承認德國併捷，如對德提出嚴重抗議，如召回駐德大使，如宣佈內閣决定與全世界愛好和平國家立卽保持密切接觸，如蘇波經濟合作談判的圓滿結束，如海外貿易大臣赫德森之啓程赴莫斯科，與蘇聯開始商談政治合作，本月廿三日晚張伯倫還重申英國决心，謂『德國如重演其旣往之行動，必至引起英國及其他國家不斷的抵抗。德國如再威脅獨立國家，吾人當竭全力以抗拒其企圖。』英政府的態度雖還不够堅定與澈底，但廣大求自由的英國人民，地位日益重要的工黨與共黨的領導，則將成爲决定英國前進的主要力量！</p>
<p>法</p>
<p>法國在侵略者的加緊進攻之下，其地位更較英國爲危險；當此英國態度嗨向積極反抗法西斯侵略者之際，法國方面就發出許多準備抵侵抗略的消息：什麼法國加緊戰備啦，什麼秘密實行動員啦，什麼法總統廿二日聘問倫敦商决英法軍事合作啦，什麼法總統準備赴美訪問羅斯福討論民主和平國家的大團結啦。但是我們對於這些消息亦絕不能作過高的估計，特別重要的是法國金融寡頭繼續壓迫其政府，使其走向右傾反動的絕路，現在還藉口歐局與力，實行澈底廢除每週四十小時工制及人民陣綫僅存的較好的法令，實行對勞苦大衆與中下階級的高度壓榨，這種政策顯然將帮助法西斯侵略者從法國內部增加法國危機！听幸法國廣大人民正在雙重壓迫下加緊鬥爭，而其領導者共產黨與社會黨亦有更步一進的團結，法政府如不急向反法西斯之路邁進，就決受到致命的打擊吧！</p>
<p>美</p>
<p>美國反法西斯反侵略政策更加堅定與進步，本週內表現在事實上的是美總統羅斯福之嚴厲聲斥德國併捷，並呼籲民主國家立卽密切合作；是美國政府正式送出指責德國非法暴行的牒文；是美國財部之廢止美捷協定與開始實施對德經濟制裁的步驟；是參議院外委會主席畢德門之提出廢止中立法案，將獰得多數贊同修正通過；是擴大對日實施經濟制裁的醞釀等等都是。美參議院並於廿二日通過政府改組法案，予羅斯福總統以若干權力，以推行其政策。由此可以窺見英國反對羅總統進步政策的反動派，雖在加緊無恥的兇橫的進攻，而在全國一致的反法西斯的怒潮下，這種反動勢力已在衰弱下去了。</p>
<p>此外許多未爲法西斯併吞的小國如羅馬尼亞，波蘭，保加利亞，希臘，土耳其等，亦在積極推職民主和平國家與蘇聯合作，實行集體安全制度，保衛世界和平。</p>
<p>蘇聯新獲重大成功</p>
<p>完成社會主義建設進向共產主義建設的蘇聯，在這漢西斯重分世界的新的帝國主義戰爭前面，是唯一堅强無敵的民主和平國家。這個國家最近又獲重大的成功。第一是聯共第十八次大會，已於本月廿一日圓滿給束。這次大會通過了潑展國民經濟的第三個五年計劃的建議案，通過了關於實行蘇聯新意法增强黨政和軍事力量的建議案，通過了發展國防力量和關於反對法西斯，反對侵略，援助全世界民埃解放運動和援助反法西斯運動的　案，而改選中執監委結果，史達林，莫洛托夫，伏羅希洛夫，加格諾維支，加　寧，馬奴爾斯基等均護全國熱烈擁護而入選，張鼓峯事件中指揮痛擊日×的格烈科里修特將軍，亦被選爲委員，更爲各國注目。這次大會對於蘇聯本國以至世界人類，自將有極重大的貢獻，而蘇聯在世界的威信，亦將大大的提高。第二，是對德國併捷事件，蘇聯表示贊成英法所提聯合討論歐局辦法，並且透露具將建議立卽召集英法蘇羅波土聯席會議的意向，因此蘇聯和平政策的政治影響，在歐洲以至全世界獲得更新更廣泛更重大的發展，不僅歐洲和近東許多小國益感蘇聯所倡建立集體安會制度的迫切需要，卽英法美各國人民·輿論·及政黨方面，亦莫不熱烈要求立卽實現或加强與蘇聯合作，英法政府且不得不實際要求蘇聯參加討論歐　。本月廿四日英國海外貿易大臣在莫斯科發表談話，卽已明言　蘇談話經過和洽，並具有政治上之重要性。第三，是蘇日漁區糾紛事件。三月十五日，蘇聯斷然拒絕日方要求，實行　賣漁場，儘管日本之迭次揚言如何進攻蘇聯，現在事實證明，日本侵略者終於在蘇聯嚴正强硬的表示下面冉度屈膝了，本月廿四日日本外務省發言人稱：「本月廿二日在莫期科舉行漁業談判結果，距談判中日本所採取之妥協態度，相離甚遠，惟日本仍决與蘇聯繼續磋商」—這是張鼓峯事件第二！是日本對蘇聯屈膝的又一表現！</p>
<p>抗日戰局激轉緊張</p>
<p>歐洲形勢嚴重使日本侵略者加緊其對華軍事的冒險投機，日本對蘇屈膝，更可窺見×人加緊威脅我屈服的决心！這一週來的中日戰局所以轉趨緊張，便是日×對我軍事冒險投機計劃的反映。</p>
<p>一週來戰事特別使人注目的，是在華中戰場。長江以北，×軍在鍾祥一帶改取守勢，將主力南移，力謀强渡襄河。這一方面的×軍，　在企圖牽制我鄂中鄂西重兵。而掩護其『南昌攻略』中的兵力調遣。幸經我軍發揮運動戰略，不斷反攻×軍側翼及後方，同時避免正面的集中的大戰，結果×軍反爲我各小部隊所分散，而我軍主力則正待機實行殲滅×軍主力。長江以南及東綫戰爭，是本週的戰事重心。×軍爲圖遂行其「南昌攻略」，集中主力，自南潯綫左右兩翼猛烈南犯，十九日强佔永修，廿日晚起強渡修水，廿三日，×先頭部隊越安義奉　，企圖迂圍南昌。迄今南潯綫左翼，戰事正在劇烈進行中。同時×軍加緊進攻淅東，飛機轟炸及騷擾溫州等地，並集中大隊戰艦於杭州　與浙東沿海一帶，而杭州方面之×又大舉强渡錢塘江，東窺鄞縣，南犯金華，企圖截斷浙贛鐵路，策應進犯南昌之×。×人計劃，以爲攻陷南昌，進，則可以西聯湘鄂之×，長驅進逼長沙，打通粵漢路而協同粵南之×以犯桂滇。退，亦可切斷我腹地交通，加强其東南省佔領區的統治，積極整頓，掠取民力，再圖進取。不過×人的陰謀雖兇，而我們亦毫不示弱，贛北方面，我援軍自廿日起已源源開到，現在離南昌四十餘英里處猛截進犯之×。而湘北我軍，亦已大舉向岳州東南進攻。湘鄂贛邊我軍亦已出動，直襲進犯南昌之×的翼側及後路。浙東方圍，我軍已有嚴密配備，保衛交通，阻截×軍，强渡錢江之×千餘，已遭殲滅。同時蘇浙皖邊我軍，又分別北上南下，北上則截擊×之援軍，南下則痛擊×之後路。預料×人南昌攻略的結果，將是其華中精銳的傾覆。至於北方戰局，我爲防止×軍調向其他戰塲，並加以重大打擊起見，業已盡九發動反攻。連日晋夾邊區迭有激戰，冀魯各地游擊戰並未稍停，蘇北我軍則反攻兩淮，而皖西皖中我軍亦已發動反攻，克復望江。華南方面，大局尙無變化。不過×人認定西南是我國持久抗戰主力集中所在，又有重要外援的交通綫，所以正在秘密準備猛烈的進攻，這是我們在注觀華中戰局時所不能絲毫忽視的。</p>
<p>××這種新的進攻。可以證明：我們在此國際形勢日還有利的形勢下，必須立卽準備進一步的防範與打擊日×。同時證明一切潜伏的和明目的反共主和論者的言論行動，能欺騙我民衆，離間我團結，掩護×人殘酷的新的進攻。我們爲要粉碎×人新的進攻與漢好陰謀，在軍事上要加强前綫戰鬥力，與發展×後游擊戰，戰區黨政委會已在平週成立，希望對此作更大的努力。在外交上是要推進屬際和平陣綫，爭取更多的外今後應該更有多方面的發展。特別重要的是政治上要加緊全國的團結和實行集中領導的民主政治。現在各雀市縣參議會，已以陝甘寗邊區開始，粵黔等省紛紛定期成立，我們不能不寄與殷切的期望，以便由民治的推進，而實現全民族精神與物質力量的總動員，以完成抗戰建國的大業。</p>
<h3 id="c3">深圳農村工作近況 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>【深圳通訊】「中國抗戰的力量在農村」這句話是說得不錯，就人力方面來講、據一般的統計、中國人口的百分之八十以上是農民，十個中國人中，就有八個是農民，這卽是說，中國抗戰的人力動員，照比量農民是佔有八成，就物力方面來講，中國是以農立國，大部分生產，還負在農民身上，抗戰期內糧食的供麥、是靠農民勤辛耕種得來的收穫，在精神動員方面、農民也具有克苦耐勞，不苟且，不偷懶，不取巧的種種優美個性，這正是中國抗戰建國的支柱。</p>
<p>深圳農村福和會是認識了這種力量，而且在這客觀環境的要求，决心去裁培這種力量，於是，在第二期抗戰開始的初期，它就以堅苦卓絕的爲農民服務的恣態，現身在抗戰的洪流中了。</p>
<p>這個團體的創辦人是陳丕士先生，陳先生曾以更大的心血去完成　全部工作的計劉，一切工作的進行，早在他的信心和把握之中。</p>
<p>深圳農村福利會的成立，是在去年十一二月間，正當×人退出深圳不久以後，然而眞正工作的開始，還在本年一月，全部工作的職員都是國內各有名大學的畢業生，他們都專修敎育，農業，工藝和政治各種科學的，有着工作的機動性，在工作能力上，也比許多農村工作團體進步的。</p>
<p>爲了展開農村的工作是有着許多的困難，「福利會」開始工作的時候，首先碰到的是：</p>
<p>一，農民的保守性未能淸除，譬如他們都是，足安份的良民，天公下雨，得感謝天爺爺，天公不下雨，只有怨自已命苦。因爲深圳多山地，並沒有通流的河水可能全部灌溉，農民一向的慣例。要開耕還要等待天公酒下幾塲春雨，「福利會」爲了解救農民的痛苦，就計劃了而且决定了築壩蓄水，首先自然徵求了農民的同意，商定了人力物力的担負間題，可是等到要動手的時候，農民又多方推却了，他們說：第一築了壇，就妨碍了船隻的來往。第二，天是必然會下雨的，用不着化這許多工夫去開築壕壩。</p>
<p>第二件碰到的就是經費　措困難，因爲農村工作的展開是要從救濟農民處着眼，深圳是在×人炮火的懷憂，沒有經費救濟他們的顚沛流離，是很難展開工作的，不過，陳先生丕士這樣說：「經費我們不曾憂慮到，我們所憂慮的還是工作做得不好」，陳先生這種工作的精神，也是「福利會」在×人的懷裏展開工作的偉大精神的表現。</p>
<p>第三，深圳有着牠的特殊環境，緊貼着淪陷區的左隣，農民常時風聲鶴唳，工作發動也較爲困難。</p>
<p>在×人的懊裏展開工作雖然是困難，然而「福利會」已漸次地把這種困難克服了。現在牠已經呈現着在困難中成長了的新姿態，記者曾隨該會服務，茲將深圳農民槪况，作一簡單的報吿：</p>
<p>推動春耕</p>
<p>深圳附近有千多家農戶，在×人不斷的侵擾之下，損失頗爲嚴重，就耕牛方面來講，據統計以前是有七百多頭，現在則僅剩六十多頭，前後相差的數目，是有六百多頭，以六十多頭件，分配給千家農戶，平時已經不够分配，在春耕期間家家在同一時間內開耕，牛的分配就顯得缺乏了，「福利會」的訏劃救濟是：第一，盡可能的由外界買來或奢租來耕牛，分給農民使用，第二，趕築蓄水壩，和用河水涌溉可能灌溉的水田，目前深圳的農民，對於牛的使用可以一先一後，把分配上的不够和緩了，「福利會」還向檀香山和菲律賓捐助了許多優良的種子，分發每家農戶，肥田料的製造法，草菇裁培法，是由嶺大敎授林理察博士分區指導，農村貸欵也在進行中，目前深圳的農村，已日見勃勃生氣了。</p>
<p>舉辦小學</p>
<p>深圳各條鄉村，都是辦有小學的，自×人侵擾之後，敎員們大半都逃走了，學生們也迫得遊手偷間，敎育成爲停頓的狀態，「福利會」在那裏就舉辦兩間小學，一間是在蔡屋圍，一間在格田，目的是救濟失學兒童的，第一不收學費，書本由福利會分發，第二圖書舘是募集外界和學生的書建立成功的，第三，敎材內容是信札，珠算，戰時常識，政治講話，農作和歌詠等，學校的情况大概就是如此，目下學生的人數共有三百餘名，由一年級至六年級，並開有特別班（初中程度）的。</p>
<p>救護與軍事</p>
<p>「福利會」到了深圳之後，除了舉辦小學之外，也實行成年人的抗戰敎育，救護方面，是防毒，夢紮，敷藥，軍事方面，游擊，防守，防避空襲，和計劃撤退，農作方面，是肥田料製造，土壤改良，種軍茹等，深圳的農民漸漸活躍起來了，將在×人的懷裏刺進一把銳利的刺刀。</p>
<p>偉大的工作展開了之後，×人懷裏的深圳，就成了一個抗戰堅强的堡壘了，爲了有躍的事實的表現，「福利會」也得到社會人士許多同情與捐助，港政府及我國政府也加以嚴勵與同情，在×人瘋狂的轟炸下，深圳已成爲廢壚了，雜民營也遭了火災，深圳的農民過着更慘苦的生活，然而「福利會」這個團體仍像鐵石一般挺立着，展開了有計劃的工作，茲探錄其目前的工作計劃于下：</p>
<p>一、創辦集體農場——該會創辦人陳丕士先生和東江地方政府商討的結果，决於最近在深圳附近東莞與寶安之間，舉辦一所集體農場，物容因抗戰影響而流離失所的農民，其計劃據說和朱舞靑先生在四川發動的「川邊墾殖團」相彷彿，遭轟炸而又遭火災「禍不單行」的深圳難民，想再有歸宿了吧，</p>
<p>二，舉辦農村合作社——爲了配合目前抗戰的要求，該會決定在普通的農村中舉辦合作社，參加戰時的生產，以帮助救濟難民，採取集團生產與消費，杜絕農村的寄生虫高利貨的剝削。</p>
<p>三，組織農民和武裝農民——該會爲了深入×人後方，凝加緊組織農民和武裝晨民的工作，增加他們的工作發展與援助。</p>
<p>四，擴大工作　——目前該會的工作，僅不過由深圳展開到常平，龍華，南頭一帶，地域還很有限，該會爲了擴大工作起見，正在計劃着擴大工作區運動，「我們始終未曾想到，工作到那時才了結」這是成爲該會的口號。</p>
<p>深圳，南頭，東莞，……已在×人後方活躍起來了，武裝的農民在×人炮火下生長着，是在×人的胸懷裏挿進一把銳劍，在第二期抗戰中，這是偉大勝利的昭示。（民革社）</p>
<h3 id="c4">西康之寶庫（下） <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>礦床成分</p>
<p>寶興三元兩廢洞，在戴黃口之山溪林，距山峯約十里，距山脚，榮要道約六里，路狹壁立，攀登不易，山脚隙地，有三元廠之令牌式鍊爐二座，及鍛鑛塘多處。尙未全毀，該廠距榮經縣　百二十里，距成都五百五十里，運銅外出，必經二百一十里之旱脚，始到雅安，改由車運成都或船運嘉定，寶興三元兩廠所採鑛床，均爲豎柱形，土人稱豎心鑛，該柱上小下大成海　式，據聞土法抽水，已接到四十八根竹筒，但筒不皆直立，大概鑿深，已達四十丈左右，該鑛含銅成分，據當日化騐、，約爲百分之十，較彭縣白水河大實山銅鑛，平均含銅百分之四者，優越兩倍半，三元廠四周，產銅範圍寬廣，廠東對茶河合岡廠西乾溪山腹、皆有明顯之露頭，廠北二十里豆豆地，曾經開源鐵廠開採，其鑛脈長八里，寬二十里，厚一尺五寸，覘此，可知榮經北區銅鑛之經濟價値突。</p>
<p>冶煉方法</p>
<p>過去煉銅、悉用土法，鍛塘如圈椅形，邊高六尺。直徑九尺，橫徑八尺，第一步，鍛鑛用杠炭發火，約需十日。第二步，鍛鑛三烤三打，大槪三天，俟銅液凝結，以木條拖去，先褐出之數曆，爲水銅，次揭出之數曆爲撓銅再下爲正。第三步，煆冰銅，鍛塘較鑛塘小，依層舖鍛翻燒五次，冰銅上面，必發現銅珠。第四步溜銅，用爐冶煉，閉門抽風至紅，最後用反射爐精煉，乃得九九精銅。查榮經銅鑛，如大量採煉，每日可產精銅十五噸至二十噸，惟鑛曆尙未確切瞪實，若用新法冶煉，須俟政府酌派地質專家會同鑛學專家多次勘查，方能議及，現値抗戰期間，需要精銅，至多且急，開發勢不容緩，一般意見，榮經戴黃溝山溪林銅鑛，最好由康省府試辦，籌辦經費，預算黨國幣十萬元。至榮境前後聚壩之銅鑛，最好由省府鼓勵民營！如資本不足，由省預支一部份，如此，則民間因銅有銷塲，且創辦經費，得由省府協助，自必踴躍籌備，爭先開工，其得銅數量之大，可斷言也。（續完）</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者：賡雅</p>
<p>汽取每一過經着有這樣窰居的地帶，上仰危崖，下臨深溪，眞令人有點談虎色變。但另據一個朋友王鎭海君談，豫陝　邊區的土匪，他們大多數都有一種連繫，具有梁山泊代抱不平的精神，和哥老會「興漢滅滿」的意識。在某一種秘密的社會階層里，尙流行若的江湖　　　問：「手提撐花（傘）有多少大股？多少小股了」。須答：二三十六大股，七十二小股，一百零八個褶子。」卽影射梁山一百單八將的故事。又問：「身背捲子（包裹行李）多少重？」須答：「二斤十三兩五錢四分。」卽暗切舊時亡明江山，有南北二京，十三省，五湖四海。諸如此類含有「興漢滅滿」的意識的隱語，在江湖上流行着的還很多，若我們利用得法，當然可以將它轉要成「抗戰建國」的標語，而一致實踐起來。</p>
<p>商縣是陝西毗鄰豫鄂邊區的重鎭，汽車駛達縣城，街燈已亮，市民來的如　。上車後，從西門入效，路旁很多小販，各設紙燈籠夜市，遠看恰似據在路旁兩出明珠。燈上寫着「打倒×寇」「打倒×××國主　」「統戰　　，爭取最後勝利」等標語，邊定邊看，又　遇著兩列燈球　行隊。可是販攤雖如　球一燒的多，但他們所費的貨色，僅是大餅，落化生，酒歸煮鷄蛋等，寥寥三四趣而已。大　大如簸箕，倒立燈球旁邊、不僅誘惑路人的食慾，而用誇耀着抗戰第一期的大豐收。往訪縣長未晤，折返城外旅館，憲兵已將行李打開檢查，可見這里警戒也很森嚴。</p>
<p>第三天，車行經過拜陣西安的秦嶺支脉，上坡走了四十里，見山頂藍關附近，春雪還未消融。下坡也是四十里，風馳電掣般一會兒就到了監田；當天南可進抵西安，可惜車有毛病，連推帶拖地費了很多力量，結果仍然下榻藍田。</p>
<p>藍田徵兵抽籤，雖則已屆四次，可是有弟兄四人的，還不曾抽完。有弟兄三人以及二人的。他們那磨拳擦掌　　備云　。云年今春×後無論城市鄕村，結婚的人，真是鳳雲紀湧，他們目的生「有後」，在「家里付旗有人」——就是這般健兒準備×工作的一種反映，不過他們結婚還沿用着從前花紅大轉，　　齊鳴的浪費儀式；尤其新夫婦初入洞戾飲合香酒時，新郎須高立床上，舉腿向花枝招展的新婦頭上，彷彿偵　機似的繞上　匝，取說傳說紛紜，這都是極應革除的限俗。</p>
<p>第四天，駛過油綠綠的千頃萬畝的麥地，沿路欣賞着關中特產——高翔飛舞的鶴羣，在一個中午警報解除的長聲中，到了今日我國碩果僅存的古都——西安。</p>
<p>同時還碰着一個好機緣，馬上就可以到陝北黃河防綫上去。</p>
<h3 id="c19">在戰鬥中建立的新軍 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>南嶽航空特訊</p>
<p>抗戰的第一期以空間換取時間，一方消耗×人，一方掩　沿海沿江各省人民及工業的向內陸轉進；第二朋的抗戰，則不僅要爭取時間，更要保持空間。一方阻滯×人，一方使後方有集中所有人力物力財力，加強抗戰實力，刷新反攻陣容，後者　抗戰中國最艱苦的時期。</p>
<p>這時期的最迫切的要求是新軍的建立，最重大的工作也是新軍的建立。</p>
<p>抗戰建國是中華全民族的偉業。「建國必須建軍」，全國人民，已一致在這一無上光榮的旗號之下，參加進行抗戰的各部門；尤其是靑壯，千萬的農民和工人，放下鑛斧，列成新軍；千萬的知識靑年，接受着適合自己的各兵種的訓練。他們像才出坑道的金屬鑛，經過大鎔爐的鍛鍊而成鋼鐵一般，變成了鐵的洪流。</p>
<p>可是，因爲×人在配備上較優於我，戰線的延長，復開近代戰事中的新紀錄；而我方除了在線的方面須要數世佔優的兵力來和×人對峙，在面的方面，更須要多多益善的武裝來佔領，擴張和確保；事實上不允許我們有充分的時間在後方訓練新的兵員，我們不在戰鬥中建立新軍，</p>
<p>也許有人以爲久經訓練的正規軍，在過去的二十個月中，尙不免受相當的損失；繼握槍桿，初臨戰陣的新軍，是否能祖負當前的重任，還是問題。這種疑問在原則上講，固然不無理由，在事實上却可獲得相反的結論。</p>
<p>最近，筆者從兵役工作人員，新兵訓練人員，指揮新兵作戰的中下級軍官，以及新兵自己的談話中，找到了如下的實例。</p>
<p>兵役何以目前已衝出難關，在兵派上可以收不竭之效，其根本的原因，不外：第一，政治的動員，使多數民衆能了解惟有抗戰才能生存的意義。第二，政治的改革，使兵役能普徧發展，征人減少後顧之憂，合理，公平，成了簡易有效的徵集方法。雖然目下還不免有少數規避兵役的，那只是少數個人的畏葸心理的表現，由於兵役辦理不善的，已在逐漸減少之中。</p>
<p>新兵在後方的訓練，往往因爲前方須要大量的乓員，經過很短的時間，便開往前方補充或作戰了。過去在後方逃亡的新兵，爲數不少，其原因，除了和逃避兵役一般以外，便是敎官還是不能廢除打罵，軍隊生活較家庭生活更苦，使若干自尊心理堅强的，以及家庭生活較優裕的員兵發生反感。現在，禁止打罵已漸成新兵訓練的絕對原則；而對新兵的政治工作，也在積極設法消長其對物質生活和精神生活的重視。尤具是在政治上的覺悟。使他們克復了安土重遷，愛鄉思家的心理，勇敢地走上抗×的前綫。</p>
<p>臨陣晚逃，作戰畏縮的新兵，在二期抗戰中，據三五中下級軍官說：已不再發現。卽有也終是少數中的極少數。因爲在應徵和訓練後還沒有逃亡的士兵，大半具有爲國犧牲的决心，生死早已置諸度外，且因戰術的改變，地利的有利，以及極端的機動性便×人無法施展優勢的武器，由於殺傷的減少，以及×軍士氣的不振，否定了若干新兵，作戰卽死亡的觀念，矯正了畏懼×人的心理，知道作戰並不一定死亡，機會也很少。×人並非三頭六臂，不過是比自己更怕死的一些傢伙。這一切，鼓舞了新軍的士氣。譬如：新兵在陣前發現×蹤時，常不問×人是否已進人射界，便開槍射擊。經過實戰的經驗，知道當×人未進入射界射擊時，反使×人加速逼近射界；如待×人進入射程，則一經以緊密的火網壓迫，便鼠竄而去。他們知道了沉着應戰。又如：對於×人施放毒氣，過去的新兵一見陣前有烟幕昇起，便知爲毒氣，精神上刺激甚大，現在×人卽施放毒氣，亦知道利用地形，向高處暫避。（第一期抗戰中，×軍每兵有防毒面具，現任平均每四五人始可得一具。所以常因風向關係有自身中毒者。）至於砲擊或空中轟炸，過子陣地戰時我方遭受相當的損害，十氣亦受相當的威脅，目下因爲改用縱深配備，不重一綫一點之爭，它的威力已大爲減弱。×方砲擊數百發，我方死傷數人是常有的事。×空軍也因無法尋取目標，卽濫施轟炸，我方損失亦微，新兵的畏縮心理旣不再存在，殺×致果，便成爲必然的事實了。</p>
<p>新兵因爲在後方訓練不够，一入戰地，在×前也日以繼夜的在訓練着。在修河南岸的某部，便在×前練習打槍。甚至除了制式訓練以外，一切訓練都在×前舉行。他們加速地在成長着，班長，排長，連長等下級軍官，更特別注意「做人」，和士兵之間，雖有階級的差別，但親愛精誠，如同兄弟或師友。一個初　戰陣的士兵，在擔任警戒哨的任務時，常由班長或排長陪往陣前，敎以如何警戒，如何退回，並且說：「在此不要怕，我等會就來看你。」之後，不到三個月，便漸成爲一個勇敢和機敏的哨兵了。諸如此類，不勝枚舉。在服裝方面，因爲須要和供給的相差甚多，少數新兵初到前方時，常沒有軍服，綁腿或草鞋的。他們知道國家的艱苦，並無不滿。原有的弟兄們要把裏面的舊軍衣，送給他們，把破爛的軍服撕成綁帶，把自己的舊鞋分給他們穿着。這種精神是新軍之實。</p>
<p>新車在技術上固待加緊訓練，但在素實上，却純良於募兵時代的兵士。他們是眞正的人民的軍隊，能和人民融洽相處，軍風紀的保持也就很少問題了。同時，因爲沒有政治意識的軍隊必然是烏合之衆，軍事當局正把政治的血液向新軍灌輸。目下每團有政治工作人員××人。在不久的將來，將有砍工人員×千人担任每連的政治指導員。這一種新的血液，也就是我們反攻的力量，它將發揮大無長的精神以擊滅當前的×人！</p>
<p>這裏所報吿的只是關於步兵方面的一小部分。我們知道中國正多方面的在建立新軍。但從這裏可以推瀾到其他。知道了這些，我們可以確信「最後的勝利是我們的」這句話决不會落空。</p>

<h3 id="c36">美末爾 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 董平譯</p>
<p>打開歐洲地圖，你會看見一塊狹長的土地；它的東北倚在立陶宛，它的南境隣着東普魯士，它的西邊流的是波羅的海的狂濤，那便是令日舉世矚目的美末爾。</p>
<p>美末爾的簡史：它原是屬德國的，戰後由立陶宛人以暴力攫去，今日又由德國人以暴力攫回。</p>
<p>美末爾雖然只是塊蕞爾的小地方，但在歷來的國際尋糾紛中，它都是一個癥結。去年中歐危急的時候，張伯倫移尊訪德，也還和希特勒大談其美末爾。今日的事實，是否是那次談話所引起的後果，誰知道。</p>
<p>大戰結束之後，等末爾是在協約國勢力控制之下，駐有法軍維持治安。那時的立陶宛剛脫去俄國執覇，在戰後成長起來。</p>
<p>至一九二三年，武裝的立陶宛人，跟留駐的法軍一再騷擾，法軍司令一面向立陶宛抗議，一面向協約國吿急，英國的艦隊立刻向波羅的海馳去。</p>
<p>但，太遲了，幾千名立陶宛人，把二百名法軍攢走了，正式攫佔了美末爾。翌年，立陶宛頒訂了美末爾法典，允許美末爾的一部份自治權。英，法，意，日四國也同意保證立陶宛的領土完整及美末爾的自治權。這機，事實便算大家公認了。其實，協約國的這種決定，實在是不得已的粉飾，因爲立陶宛的者都維蘭給波蘭强佔去了，她們也是馬馬虎虎承認了的。</p>
<p>以後幾年，美末爾全是立陶宛的世界。許多地名和路名，都自德文改成了立陶宛文，想叫日耳曼居民不生懷鄕之念。這似乎還相當成功，那些年中，的確不曾有一點親德的呼聲。至少，煽動專家希特勒那時還不曾上台。</p>
<p>到一九三三年，希特勒登台不久，美末爾人便開始憧憬囘到日耳曼帝國的懷抱。宣傳鼓吹的事，如雨後春筍。</p>
<p>至一九三四年，立陶宛見勢不佳，乃派大軍開入美末爾，逮捕日耳曼領袖及要員一百多人，控以圖謀規復美末爾入德之罪，四人判死刑，上百的都判長期監禁。</p>
<p>自然，希特勒馬上提出强硬抗議，大有劍拔弩張之勢。立陶宛只得軟下來，免了死刑，改爲監禁。</p>
<p>現在的「美末爾漢倫」牛曼，便是判死刑的一個。後來改關十二年徒刑，但只關四年，他便赦放了，上星期中，他乃得穿着藏靑的制服和長統靴，在美末爾耀武揚威。</p>
<p>牛曼的對手，便是高高顴骨的立陶宛總統斯米托那氏，他跟波蘭的比蘇斯基將軍和捷克的貝奈斯博士一般，同是把祖國自外人壓迫下解放出來的革命功臣。他的對象是俄國。</p>
<p>他幼年時，因爲禱吿不肯用俄語，而甩立陶宛語，洽事校甩開除出來。當他進了聖彼得堡大學，他便變成了立陶宛獨立運動的黨徒了。</p>
<p>在美末爾，斯米托那是沒有多少權力的，因爲那兒的地方議會裏的廿七席代表，日耳曼黨佔到廿四席。他們都採行納粹敬禮，歡呼納粹口號，組織納粹衝鋒隊。</p>
<p>美末爾的空氣總是不寧靜的。日耳曼人和立陶宛人的衝突，問常不斷。去年六月裏的一次大衝突，雙方在街上搏戰了兩小時之久，結果死了一個十六歲的納粹靑年，傷了五十多。這次騷動，把當時的歐洲攪得很緊張，大有山雨欲來風滿樓之勢。</p>
<p>後來，風雲是消散了——只是表面上的。</p>
<p>去年九月，張伯倫訪德囘來之後，英國下議院中的議員，問起美末爾的情况，張伯倫的囘答是：希特勒說，如果立陶宛政府能始終恪守美末爾法典，他是很高與美末爾維持現狀下去的。</p>
<p>請注意這句話：「如果立陶宛政府能始終恪守美末爾法典……」那是很容易找個藉口的，儘管說立陶宛政府已不能恪守美末爾法典好了。至少，美末爾的居民已在以受虐待的少數民族自居了。</p>
<p>慕尼黑協定出賣了捷克之後，希特勒親口說他不冉有其他土地要求。但幾天之後，柏林半官方却說：這幷不是表示元首忘記了深切關心德國以外的日耳曼人。</p>
<p>接着十月裏，柏林便開始攻擊立陶宛，說壓迫美末爾日耳曼人。</p>
<p>後來，事情愈見顯明。美末爾納粹黨的副頭目柏蒂萊竟向美末爾報界發表談話：「美末爾割離德國祖國，實違反美末爾人民之心願，現在我們一致要求重歸德國，未來的選舉即是民意的表現；美末爾重歸德國的要求，已不可遏止」。</p>
<p>果然，選舉的結果，日耳曼人風捲殘葉，獲得完全勝利。</p>
<p>希特勒出頭把美末爾劃入東普魯士，是不會遇到多少反抗的。美末爾是注定了要走上奧大利，捷克斯洛伐克的命運的。</p>
<p>終於，它是這樣走了。——譯自廿四日士　西報——</p>

<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>——由一齣革命歷史劇的寫作歷程說起</p>
<p>對在建立民國的鬥爭中成仁的先烈們致民族革命最敬禮！</p>
<p>戲劇是鬥爭行爲形眾化的紀錄，沒有鬥爭就沒有戲劇。歷史上一切偉大的戰鬥，都是戲最好的題材，而一切偉大的戲劇都是人類人爭的表現（而不是再現）。</p>
<p>黃花崗這幾天地而泣鬼神的歷史的環節，正是最人性的，最富於血肉的現實，牠是最戲劇的。可是牠是一個複雜的歷史過程，牠包含着深沉的歷史的遺留，它包含着當時社會矛盾的關係。牠包含着多樣的個性，牠包含着豐富的情緒，一個歷史的尖端，一個社會的癥結，能够表達那偉大精神的，只有戲劇；但惟其是繁複多樣而富於內在的意義，所以這樣一齣歷史劇，在寫作上其歷程也是很繁雜而曲折的。</p>
<p>廣東戲劇協會的二十二個作者，曾以集體的努力，從事這個試驗，成績雖然不一定好，可是在所發現的多種困難中，了解了許多以前所不知道的物事。至少，在歷史分析的意義上，這不失爲戲劇工作者自我教育的一個好的方法。</p>
<p>二十二個人在三天之內完成了「黃花崗」這四幕六場的史劇，在中國話劇史中依然是一個奇蹟。我們之中，並沒有一個是參與其役的，亦沒有一個是同時代的人。我們的把握，是靠了科　——那了解社會歷史最正確的思維方法。首先，我們討論一黃花崗之役」在民族革命史中的地位，這事件必然發生的原因，和牠的屬性，牠內在的弱點，牠對於今日抗戰的意義：達到了同一的結論之後，我們開始有了選擇脊料的土具和剪裁的準繩。其次，我們使開始搜集材料。一般的歷史，革命史關於三二丸之役的叙述，三二九專史，當時社會情形研究的書籍，烈士的遺着，關於每個烈士的描述……以及當時的畫册，詩歌，都是我們除去了經常的常識與智識之外所必須研求與攝取的素材。</p>
<p>我們開始把這事件，做成了一個有頭有尾，有血有肉的故事。這其中有備主要情節。其　都是陪襯和穿挿。主要的情節無他，革命的陣營同反革命陣營的鬬爭，結果是革命者失敗了，所以這是一齣合乎歷史的悲劇。</p>
<p>這失敗是到成功之路中間的光榮的紀念碑之一，牠不只可以令後人領略革命失敗的敎訓，還顯示它是十月十日民國誕生有力的原因。所以統治全劇的絕不是失敗主義的惰緒，而是偉大的革命精神的橫溢；在一次的必然的挫折中，烘託出革命必然成功的前路。我們寫出革命者陣營組織的不够，英雄主義，拚死主義，甚至於慷槪的傷感主義的Provailing，寫出戰略的錯誤，寫出內奸的破壤，但是主要地我們寫出了最偉大的革命情緒，也是戲劇中人類情緒之最偉大者——犧牲。我們寫出滿淸統治者的庸懦和荒淫，寫出他們「寧給外人不給家奴」的妄念，但也寫出他們內部的矛盾（這是他們到底失敗的一個原因），和他們在對付革命勢力這一要求上是統一而且是優勢的，（這是三二九革命所以受挫折的原故）。每個人有他的性格，這性格是一部分人典型，也是社會一個Phase的標誌。每個人個性中有他自己的矛盾，但好多人會有他們的共同點。</p>
<p>對於事件的透視，合乎歷史事實的故事的搆成，創造出富於motive的個性，這是寫革命歷史劇的首先而且首要的步驟，黃花崗的集體創作可以做一個例。至少是一個badexample。</p>
<p>冀花崗事件是英雄的血所開的花，黃花崗劇本則是血的時代所開的戲劇的花。</p>
<h3 id="c58">舞臺技術講話 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 盧敦</p>
<p>五　演員的藝術</p>
<p>「忘我」與半個自我</p>
<p>演員的藝術就是以個人扮演人，以演員自身的身體以及靈魂來表出劇中角色的身體及靈魂，就因爲一個原故，所以就有人主張：當派員正在進行表演藝術底創造的時候，應該完全地否定了自我的存在，而必須要做到所謂「忘我」的境界，要把「心靈化裝」換言之就是忘掉了自己，把自己的人格以至於身體的整個變成了劇中角色的人格至於一切。</p>
<p>這一理論，在原則上是成立的，必須如此才能够成爲藝術的表演，不過要完成這一工作，而必須否定了演員自我底人格的存在，是不可能的。我們並不反對表演藝術底最高的成就，是演員把自我溶解於劇中角色性格之中，不過這一工作的完成，也就是演員自身底藝術的創造，也就是平時的訓總與修養的成果，並不是單單丟掉了自我的存在就司以做得到的。</p>
<p>演員在舞台上進行着的表演，其主要的工作目的是要傳達必須傳达的情緒，而藉以引起觀衆的同情，完成藝術底共鳴作用。但所傳達的情緒，却並不是「日常生活的情緒」，並子是眞的，那不過是假的，人工創造的情緒，而這假的情緒，要求其適度的表現以及像眞，是必然地需要一種力量來控制與操縱。</p>
<p>就因爲情緒必需控制與操縱，所以上面說過：演員必須能够統制他的注意力，能夠成為自己底一切表情動作的主宰，而這唯一主宰者就是演員自己的腦子，因之，演員自我的存在是不能整个地否定了的。</p>
<p>因此。演員在舞台上工作是二元性的；兩重人格的；所表現出來的是劇中角色的人格，但在這虛歸的人格後面却潛存着「半個自我」，這不露面的潛存在里面的半個自我，就好像傀儡，戲的操縱手一樣，在控制操蹤一切，不斷地劍造着角色的性格。在創造的過程中，同時又在分析批判，在表演着笑的時候，同時，就在分折這笑，批判　笑，是否達到所需要的程度。所以表演藝術是存在着矛盾性的，演員的本身兼着創造的主體與對象。</p>
<p>表演藝術的創造，就在這矛盾對立的統一，演員創作情緒的契掛與演員自身的理知的契機是相互制約的。所以，總括一句說：還是史丹尼的名句。「藉志意以表揚靈感」，演員藝術的創造，是盡量的表達着劇中的角色的性格，但却潛存着半個自我，以爲創造的主宰。</p>
<p>此外，又有些演員故意用種種的方法來引誘自己的眞情感，比方扮演醉酒，他眞的喝了大量的洒，於是他的表演就是「真實」羅！，對，這是「真實」但已經不是藝術了，已經不是在演戲，只是在身歷着眞的現實生活而已，而且這種方法隨時可能地弄到不可收拾的地步。</p>
<p>總歸一句说：演員藝術的目的：是儘量表現劇中角色的性格，傳達必須傳達的情緒，但這可不是日常生活的情緒，是演員從經騐或想像中選擇出來，而能夠由演員的自身控制操縱的非眞實的情緒。能藉意志以表揚的創造的眞實感。　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c59">「黃花崗」的演出在廣州 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 李殊倫</p>
<p>去年在廣州，『黃花崗』的演出是一種集體力量的組合和表現，它的組成是三百多個戲劇工作者和二十多個大小的劇團。</p>
<p>一年間，我還淸楚的記憶着過「黃花崗」演出工作的開始以至於完成，只不：是十天里面的事情，正因爲時間的短促和迫切，本劇是分幕的寫作着，幷且規在定兩天之內交卷出來，經過一天的總整理和油印，然後開始劇本的分配。</p>
<p>跟着劇本問題的解决，整個演出上的工作是更其煩重而緊張地開展着。這一個時候，敎育會成爲我們臨時的工場，木條，布匹，顏料以及一切舞台上的用具，夾杂地堆　於看，是，從每個淸早到晚夜，一批一批的戲劇工作者們便從事於不息的勞動了，他們有些是撤開了日常應有的事務，有些是在學校里請了事假，他們全是犧牲了自我的一切，爲着來響應一個緊急的的呼召而集中到製景工場里來。這其中，特别是小孩子們功績是永遠不能磨滅的：他預支了超越成人的工作能力，獨佔了工作上的大部分，志記了自己的年齡，忘記了吃飯，而跟隨年長的一輩在拼命地做工。就是靠了他們这種不顧一切的苦鬥的精神和勇氣，使到一支支的木條都拚凑成爲框架了，一塊塊的布都裁成灰片了，總之，敎育會里交流着一種使人激動的空氣，徹朝徹夜地　着釘子入木的聲音。</p>
<p>同時，大量的演員集中在同一個場所里，又個別的分幕排練。是那麽急忙而又緊張地，多樣的工作都在高速度底下兼程進行着。</p>
<p>到了演出的第一個晚上（廿八晚），一小部分的觀衆已經靜候開演了。舞台上的人們是益且緊張加工製作，等到漆完了最後一支圓柱，一幅灰片，「黃花崗」才得以具象地呈現在四千多個觀衆面前的。</p>
<p>因爲「黃花崗」是羣衆的戲劇。所以對於會場預先有了完密的佈置，當每一幕達到高潮的尖端時，一個聯合的齊整的歌詠隊與激昂的演說者便作爲一個有力的挿曲而進行强烈的羣衆的情緒的鼓動。於是，每一個人都作爲羣衆的一分子而做着激動自已，也同樣激動別人的工作，最後，爲響應「有錢出錢，有力出力」的募捐，必然是一宗巨大完滿的收獲</p>
<p>一直延到第三個晚上，全體工作人員的氣力都是過度地消費凈盡了，可是勇氣却意加邁進着。因而，在極度疲勞之後，還有一個勇敢的决定：這就是特爲工人而展期到另一個最後的晚上。</p>
<p>爲了這，我們忍受着過分的疲憊而歡躍起來，就在深夜里停止了睡覺，分由幾個團　負責起四千多入場券的油印。到第二天早上，親自　到許多個工友團體中去散發。所以，最後的一個晚上，是工作中叛乏得最要命的一夜，也就是亢奮得要發狂的一夜。</p>
<p>這一夜，有我們的戲劇同志發出爲工人請侖的激昂詞，工人答覆我們的是熱烈的鼓掌，贈給我們以鮮明的旗織，這是代表着他們對於抗戰工作擁護的熟忱的！</p>
<p>這一次演出，我們敢於保證：每天晚上都有四千多觀衆爲着革命先烈英勇的鬥爭行動而引起湃澎的倩絡反應。他們益且相信中華民埃的自由魂是寧死不能屈辱的，他們會信且益堅地去爭取抗戰的最後勝利。</p>
<p>其次，從這一次上演中，政府已經注視到戲劇的效果，首次實踐了雙方的通力合作，正因爲這樣，才可獲得空前的社會影響。</p>
<p>第三，在共同工作上，動昌了四百多戲劇同志，奠定了廣州戲劇界統一陣綫的基始。</p>
<p>第四，後一代的戲劇工作者們承襲了先烈的遺志，用了大無畏的苦鬥的工作精神來作爲紀念的禮物，這是戲劇鬥士們所應該永恒地保持下去的。</p>
<p>另一方面，我們無可諱言地接受這一次工作的批判和敎訓：</p>
<p>第一，由於劇本的冗長，開場和換景的遲緩，使到每一幕運續發展的戲劇故事和情緒都受到不自然的間斷　；第二，由於籌備的倉猝，候到演出上各個部門都感有不甚完滿的地力。</p>
<p>然而，這感人的未完成的傑作是站立在我們的前面，要求我們集結了更强大的力量去把它冉現出來！</p>

<p>全港四十餘個戲劇團體聯合籌備公演的最偉大的國防羣衆劇「黃花崗」、本來是决定在三二八和三二九二日夜在太平戲院演出，來紀念這個偉大的民埃紀念日的；而且，已得到香港各界賑濟華南難民聯席會的合作，答應在除戲院的租金外，撥助演出費一千元。可是，因爲時間太匆促，恐怕銷票及一切籌備來不及，故臨時决定展期至下月十五左右演出，使在宣傳外更盡籌賑的工作。現在，各劇團已開始每日在九龍海南職業學校加緊排演，幷着手準備一切佈景和服裝。賑　會方面，亦爲切實協叻起見，特於日昨第四十次大會中選派該會常務理事盧國棉，劉慶　，葉蘭泉，林培生，李建豐，陸浮等十七人組織「黃花崗」義演特務委員會，加緊工作。以全港戲劇界四十餘劇團的共同努力，配合着全港賑聯會幾上大社團的號召與協助，我們相信，「黃花崗」的演出，在宣傳和籌限兩方面，一定都會有空前　大的成績的。</p>

<p>— 唐若青</p>
<p>幾個月來在內地的經歷，使我得至了不少新的感應和總織；懷着一顆灼熱的心回到香港來，我是多麽的興為呵！</p>
<p>確實我感到十分的欣幸，因爲，在我離開香港這短短的期間裏，香港的戲劇運動竟己有了顯明的進展；人們已對於戲劇不再漠視，因而戲劇的氣氛也已逐漸地濃厚；含有時代意義的戲劇之演出，無論在質的方面或是量的方面，也都有增進的現象，同時劇團組織的產生也和話劇觀衆之增加有幷進的趨勢；報紙雜誌對於新興劇劇倡導的努力，也可以由各掃大都增關「戲劇電影專刊」明白地表示出來……凡此種種，都可以表明戲劇運動正在香港急劇展開中進行着，這實在是各位在港或旅港的戲劇工作者先進和伙伴們努力的成績，以及同情劇運的文化人贊助之功！對於戲劇缺乏修餐的我看到這種可喜的現象，該是多　快慰；同時因爲自己沒有能够在這工作中盡絲毫微弱的力量，又該是多麼的慚愧呵！</p>
<p>這次神聖的抗戰，帶給我們中華民族的進益眞是太偉大了！在我回到內地去這幾個月中，在長沙，在桂林，看到了不少使人驚嘆的各方面之革新和進步，單就我所最熟悉的戲劇工作來說，也就使我得到了許多新的認識杞不能磨滅的印象，戲劇工作者刻苦耐勞的精神，盛毅奮發的動態，各階層對於戲劇熱烈的情緒，軍政機關和文化集團對於戲劇工作聯繫的密切，以及抗戰戲劇深入農村接近大衆之切實與普遍，實在使我們不得不奮起，不得不更進一步地爲聲個運動而拋除一切私見拚命的工作！自然，香港的環境絕對不能同內地相比擬，因而在工作當中一定會受到種種的困難，不過無論如何，我至少希望我們要在最短的期間完成下面這兩點任務：</p>
<p>第一，戲劇在舞台上的演出應當質量幷進，我們要使戲劇能多多和觀衆接觸，同時每次接觸的結果，一定要給觀衆良好的印象，深刻的感動，這樣才可以使話劇運動在當地有基礎。</p>
<p>第二，我們要儘可能以使戲劇大衆化，用種種方法多舉行公開不收費的演出，使它不致於成爲中產階級以上的專有品而忽略了更重要的勞苦大衆。</p>
<p>同時，我更希望在港的戲劇同志能有機會時常和內地的戲劇工作構通，時常接納國內活動和進展的狀况，使港地戲運能在可能範圍內採取一致的步驟，合拍的行進，</p>
<p>我對於一切的修養很欠缺，對於戲劇的認識也很淺薄，以上所說的一切，自己也不敢判斷者是否正確，只可以說是我這顆灼熱的心之一點希冀，我除了誓以至誠盡力於我們大時代的劇運外，十分懇切地祈求先進們，伙伴們的指示和鞭策！</p>

<p>紅白劇團將演　羣魔亂舞名劇</p>

<p>（本報志訊）淸明節近、風雨添悉、我輩「避人桃源」、却嘆有家歸未得、</p>
<p>閒來無事、最好還是看球、不過連日春雨綿綿、遂使球　　色、　　　今天午、開伯又來、不予球人方便、誠怕那幕麗華杯足球決賽、演出不够精彩、</p>
<p>這個獎杯、乃由那已倒閉多平的羅華公司捐送出來的、於一九二五年始辦、十三年來、則以西文員隊得標次數最多、</p>
<p>動物主云亡、球人亦新陳代謝、迴思前事、不勝感　、然而、該公司有些一物留存人間、永資紀念、雖然倒　、尚「名遺後世」也、</p>
<p>是屆初賽、西文員淘汰陸軍聯隊、走入爭標的範圍內、復存野心、志在爭雄、至於華人聯隊在初賽的時候、李惠堂不　舉足之勞、領導一班少壯派、出與海軍對壘、果然一戰而捷、奪得爭標權、</p>
<p>今大此會、勝則得標、的是球場一件大事、而且「兩班名角、做唱如何」、人共賞識、一且登台會演、定然哄動一時、但願老天有情、開放「笑臉」、使此球場好事、不致因雨掃制、</p>
<p>應堂在是屆不常「出山」、出則挾策金門、必售其技、信得過今天他亦「足不留情」、而替華聯爭囘這個「天　」、</p>

<p>華聯陣裏、個個是出色人材、又是多具經騐、雖或雨中行軍、也不打緊、蓋有經騐的出能管束球兒、控制有方、自是便宜不少少、而且素稱聯絡、尤勝一籌、</p>
<p>西員隊中十一人、也能征慣戰、不可輕視、但與華聯來個比較、多有不及、故以我推測、華聯勝面居多、</p>
<p>烏烈之是個新進的內衛、工夫頗好、但昨天九龍會與南華南作戰時、他吃正鄧廣森的「球彈」、足部受傷、今天或不。上火綫、</p>
<p>若在雨中作戰、勢不能不略事盤帶、蓋肉場濕球重、而欲速交速傳、定非容易的、今天華聯前線、最好多採用內錄與外冀之間的側擊、而不可常取中央突破之計、因爲雨戰時奔跑的虧力、素所慣習的戰略、亦未必運用如意、欲求制勝、切記見機行華、</p>
<p>架打內衝、至爲狡獪、常會出擊而令對方前鋒越位、故意堂從中進取、須提防柏架所設的陷阱、</p>
<p>吿山奴與佐芝、是可怕的人物、華聯守將、必須設法釘住他倆、毋　朋比爲奸、犯我禁地、若把他倆制肘得來、後方便不致多事了、</p>
<p>比賽完畢時、效請輔政司史美（足球總　會長）夫人頒獎、目看這個「寶物」、是落在華聯之手抑爲西文員所得呢、（球場太歲）</p>

<p>【本報專訊】昨天午後三時半、踏上大星小輪、遇着『王橫』及羅南科（南大排球宿將）、說說笑笑、不久卽誕登彼岸、在三號『巴士』車廂中、又遇着『球場幹事』周潤年、帶領『一小隊』向戰地去、</p>
<p>旣至戰地、見乙組南華與光華兩隊球人正在雨打風吠中角逐着、個個泥濘滿身、一若「醬鴨」、又見靠海那邊的棚座、展開一個「有遮」大會、此乃雨中作戰之一景、</p>
<p>乙組比賽收場、南南以二比一小勝、旣渡過此麼已達到最後階段、且看來週戰士葛、能否得勝、如到時又奪得兩分、則久未到手的乙組錦標、將爲南華的座上物了、</p>
<p>乙組收兵、甲組登塲、南華南陣裏、却少去一個中軍主帥、國產球迷覩狀、都互相詢問、「馮二叔那裏去、」他不是生毛病、午間尚有人眼見他在華人行八樓南華桌球員裏、打彈子、精神奕奕、何以忽然臨陣退縮呢、這其間、定有蹊蹺、</p>
<p>二叔旣倦勤、迫得以李恩良補乏、國產球迷見此情景、兀自担憂、以爲如此重要的戰爭、南南不以全力應付、却怎注是好、何况「地頭蛇」的九龍會、不易勝的、一般客車、都視該球場爲畏途、難道南南不出十足力量便可取勝嗎、</p>
<p>然而、不用你關心、南南自有辦法的、看吧、開賽不够一分鐘、便先勝一球了、如此神速、眞料不到、亦足見南南的僑大、再三分鐘、又破一關、勝局由此大定、而其冠軍姿態、確不平凡</p>
<p>決戰結果、南南凈勝三球、由此可見當時戰局、南南常得勢、控制全場、卒乃打破九龍主場不敗的紀錄、此番傑作、的是以優良技術得來的代價、</p>
<p>昨天我已說過、如果天雨、殊有利於南南、蓋因九龍所恃的乃地利之宜、但天旣下雨、則場據球雨、他們慣習的步驟、必失常態、自然無地利可言、各員黨坤兒的　策、又不及南南的運動有方、故我乃敢預帕南南取勝甚有把握、果也、我所說的又兌現了</p>
<p>劾利指傷缺席、是九龍的致命傷、假如有他出塲、或可滅少失球的數目、不過、昨天九龍雖有地利而不得其用、敗是應該的、卽使劾利登塲守關、亦無法挽救、</p>
<p>我方的守門要職、再由包家平担任、保衛「南華」、但「太平時節身難遏」、因門前驚險不多、他頗安閒、然在上半時曾撥一角球、具見妙手</p>
<p>前綫各員、以黎兆榮、鄧廣森爲最爽脆、兆榮善盤善運、廣森够快够氣、　稱變絕、左寫維斗文、遲緩失機、無善足陳、李恩良初次領導、亦未克勝任、但能努力作戰、期以來日、可成大器、</p>
<p>後方守將、個個稱職、防衛堅固、使敵鋒有蜀道難行之感、</p>
<p>九龍雖敗、然有一點、覺得這地頭蛇終是可怕的、如烏烈芝在上半時旣受傷、下半時調充左翼、培爾退守內衛、這麼一來、守力本受影嚮的、但他們仍能死守、不致多負、則其强頑可見一斑</p>
<p>…球場太歲…</p>
<p>上半場</p>
<p>【半分鐘】裁判員鳴笛開賽後、南南拔隊衝鋒、五路齊進、卑利士慌忙失措、漏去球兄、兆榮搶步過去、在門前將球輕掃、卽開紀錄【一比〇】</p>
<p>【三分鐘】兆榮短兵接戰、輕車熟道、左有盤旋、施其妙射、傑佛利及時一托、只負角球、斗文開來、英祺頂上開花、又克一城【二比〇】、</p>
<p>（十四分鐘）九龍反襲、天生紹漢急急佈防、衣士文在邊綫傳中、麥士維路躍頂不中、己而小諾士右路發炮、家平快手一托、球落荒野、僅免于難、這是南南在金場最險的一次、惟九龍雖得角球之利、結果無功而退、</p>
<p>（廿分鐘）斗文曾兩度得兆榮恩良之扶助、抄入九龍腹地、卒因　頭不準、射向空中去、</p>
<p>（廿八分鐘）卑利士在前衛綫出擊、侵犯榮照、被罰任意球、榮照主踢、撥交廣森、廣森猛足命射、烏烈治舉足阻擋、砰然一聲、他乃倒地、傷踝離場、乃調國亞臣充翼、衣士文回守、</p>

<p>安特魯曼遜是備初出茅慶的醫生、在一個小鎮市內作醫生助手、工作煩重而報酬小、加以那位醫生的太太又是個一錢如命待人極苛的婦人、曼遜大有每食不飽之慨、幸而他在那兒結識了一個無名醫生鄧尼、一個肯苦心研究的實踐者、兩人意氣相投、立刻結爲好友、他們發見村人的熱症多、是因爲水渠不潔的原故、而當局不加修理、無奈出了個下策、深夜用炸藥將水渠炸毀、當局只得重新修過、熱症果見减少而消滅、</p>
<p>曼遜救活了一個初生嬰見的性命、收了人家一點金錢上的酬謝、這事讓那位醫生太太知道、無名烈火高千丈、興師問罪、說他侵吞公欵、他忍無可忍、决然引去、另在一個礦區內找一個工作、祇是那個工作是要有家室的醫生充任的、他心目中雖已有其人、但尚未啓口表示、當然更未結婚、爲了不放這這個機會、他詭言卽將與未婚妻結婚、暫時的得到了這個職位、答應幾日後携眷上任、</p>
<p>他心目中的愛人便是當助手時那鎮市上的一個小學女敎員克莉絲丁瑪羅、他覺得這是應該啓口求婚的時候了、結果妻子職位兩者兼得、欣然的在礦區內設下了　務所、鄧尼送給了他一架顯微鏡、</p>
<p>他發現工人患咳者很多、是由於空中　埃過多所致、研究了好多人的痰唾、作成報吿、寄往醫學雜誌發表、頗得醫學權威人讚美、同時他忠於職務、下礦穴救人、亦得當地工人的擁戴、可是太忠於職務了、因拒簽因病休假證明書而招工人中的大亨欽金的不滿、一日、他假借曼遜虐待動物爲名、衝入他的試騐室、把他數月心血、盡行搗毀、並且開會議决、不准再養豚鼠、以供試驗、曼遜據埋力爭、說明他的試騐都是爲他們謀幸福、終歸失敗、因爲他不能繼續試驗、又離開礦區往倫敦開業行　、</p>
<p>城市內的營業不佳、負債累累、最後顯微鏡也被債主取去、就在這時侯、他突被喚住一家富戶爲一女子診病、隨後結識了她、她是個很有錢的交際花一流女子、病好之後還來約曼遜遊玩、此時的曼遜、漸漸放棄了他神聖的業務、和她、和一些酒肉徵逐的高貴醫生們終日遊樂着、生活也富裕了、瑪羅不滿意他如此荒唐下去、却是欲勸無由、</p>
<p>鄧尼抱着滿腔希望、來到倫敦想和他合作做一點救濟會病兒童的事、却被他澆了一頭凈水、一腔怒氣、借酒澆愁、一日飲醉後他向發了一大陣牢騷、到　上却　汽車　傷、本不致死、却　一位耽於游樂　於業務的醫士妙手送終、曼遜失了好友彷慎街頭、目睹貧兒痛苦情滲、亡友之言猶似歷歷在耳、恍然而悟、</p>
<p>爲了在一家管理不周、玩忽業務的醫院內抱出一個他棄識的病孩、交給一位肺病專家醫治一事、引起了醫學會的大反對、因爲那位肺病專家不是醫學會員、雖然醫好那女孩也逃不了庸西二字的詆毀、曼遜慷慨陳辭、力言醫生玩忽之不當、言完和瑪羅携手而出、繼續亡友未竟之志去了、</p>
<p>故事是依照葛魯寧氏小說名作改编、導演金雄多、主角維拔唐納和露莎蓮洛莎爾、是一丸三八年英語十大名片的首席、</p>
<p>全劇着於重羅拔唐納的曼遜醫生身上、而羅拔演來勝任愉快、他的英國口音、字字沉重有力、聽慣了美國輕快流利的語調、聽了他幾段演說、很容易受他的感動、表演一個方才踏出校門滿腔大志爲人羣服務的靑年醫生、爲環境所誘、趨於享樂、最後努力自拔、都極深刻動人、</p>
<p>露莎蓮戲較少、演來稱職、演鄧尼的賴爾夫李却遜戲更少、然而却很好、</p>
<p>對白多而不感沉悶、能抓住觀衆的心、導理處理得宜、如曼遜向瑪羅求婚一節而輕快有趣、最後一結束戞、然止、亦是簡潔有力使、人若有餘、</p>
<h3 id="c74">影迷信件分析 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>—滑頭的居多—</p>
<p>在國外電影界、每個稍有名氣的男女明星、時常收到許多影迷們信件、每個明星天天　要接到幾十百封的信、甚至還須聘請秘書來專理收發的工作、</p>
<p>可是這個影迷寫信給明星的動機、純正的固然很多、但滑頭貨色也着實不少、事實上並不像我們所想像的那麽癡心地在傾慕着他們的明星呢、</p>
<p>英國但罕攝影場是名製片家亞力山大柯達創辦的、該攝影場曾將影迷的信件、加以一番研究和統計、發現了下列的事實出來、</p>
<p>（一）祇有百分二十的影迷信件是眞情的懇切的、</p>
<p>（二）百分之十的信件是要求索討明星的親筆簽字和照片、</p>
<p>（三）有一班喜歡自出主意的人、他們寫信給明星們給以種種的批評和忠吿、勦導他們應該採用何種適合個性的故事、角色、和服裝等等、此類的信件約佔百分之十、</p>
<p>（四）向明星們乞討金　觀助的、超總百分之十五以上、這也會因為一般竊影迷　於明晨們入　之富裕、以致轉起這種念頭出來、另有百分之十的信件、要求明星們給予繼愛問題的答復、或要求代爲解决　業上的難題、他們爲了佩服過度之故、簡直把明星們當作百科全書了、</p>
<p>（五）有百分之十的信件是發自某些友愛性質的團體或組織、要求製片公司允許他們採用某個明星的名字以資號召宣傳、</p>
<p>（六）還有一種投樓家、他們來信要求明星們投資於他們的新企業、（此類多半是難以收效的、）此類占信件分類中的最多數、　百分之三十之多、</p>
<p>梅爾奧百朗隸屬該公司一的時候、有好多投機家屢次一寄信給她（那時她是最紅的英籍女明星）、替她預備好許多投資的機會、說有一種新發明的香粉、可以暢銷市面、此外還寫信給其他的明星、也說得天花亂隊、要把發財機會無條件地送給他們、</p>
<p>可是也怪不得這許多影迷的投機、事實上有許多企業是由電影明星投資創辦的、例如許多舞塲、服裝店、流動圖書館、文件代理處、和演員介紹所等、事實上很足以號召、因此引起了影迷興味、大家都忙着寫信轉明星的念頭了、</p>

<p>— 湘漁</p>
<p>聯合的號角早己吹了，行動一致的表現也早已存在了。現在我們有這一个舉動。這是講我們還應史進一步，在實際工作上，有積極的推動。我們不庸諱言，我們是在一個特殊環境中，我們的活動是受特殊限制。就我們的活動範圍講，我們雖不要隱蔽起來，迂迴曲折，以達我們的任務，可是找們却不能像法國浪漫主義開始的時候，作爲其中主要配角的高蒂哀兒（Gautier）那樣穿着「紅半臂」，引人注目，出現於這自伯氣氛很稀薄的畸形的異域，我們所要求的，是切實的工作，而不是風頭主義；是密切的合作，而不是各自爲戰。當然，抗戰以後，這種傾向，已大大的改變，可是這一條過去的尾巴，有時也從那灰色的外套中透露出來，我們現在應該淸除我們過去這種劣點，是凡有害於我們當前的目標的，我們先作一自我檢討，而把它根本剷除掉。</p>
<p>在這遙遠的後方，我們不聞砲聲，我們臭不到煙硝的氣味，可是也有許多重要的工作等待我們去做。有我們的地盤，我們的武器我們的前進的一羣，我們不發揮我們的力量，這是糟塌我們的人力物力。同時一个副有生命力的新興文化重要部門之一的文藝，如果在策略上不取攻勢，勢必退守而趨於沒落，這是一切自然界社會界事物所不能違背的公理。我們當前主要任務之一，是在如何奪取那些落後的讀者羣，把他們從那些黑色讀物的麻醉中，抬起頭來看到另一世界。這我們需要一番苦心的研究，我們應該把那些各種各機的黃色新聞，趣味讀物，以及其他一切低級的大腿肉感的讀物，都來研究一下，他們號召的力量在什麽地方，我們怎樣把這些麻醉的力量擊破，我們怎樣拿可以代替這些讀物的讀物來代替它，使讀者的傾向，漸漸的轉變過來，而能逐漸趨於高級，不致受那些淫靡的讀物的麻醉而終至沉淪不拔。這是　得化的氣力的工作，並不是空喊口號，就能完成的。同時我們所謂新文化人，常有一個目空一切的傾向，看不起那些所謂色情寫作者及他們後面擁有的讀者羣。這是一個很大的錯悮。我們要曉得我們的讀者是限於少數知識分子，學生，及進步的店員等，就數量上講，並不十分廣大的，遠不及一個我們看不起的那些色　情小說的作者擁有廣大的羣衆，儘管你天天對這些人加以蔑視的態度，或理正辭嚴地加以指摘摘自然，我們一得承認這理論的指摘是應該）的，是正當的　他們是沒有說話可以反駁的，但我們的理論家，我得吿訴你，你這篇文章，仍是寫給我們自已看的，因爲看你這樣大作的人，除開我們這樣「跑龍套」的人，得要看一下以外，其餘，就是我們圈子以內的知識分子，學生及進步的小店員，那些　造色情小說者並沒有曉得這回事，那些歡迎這樣作品的落後讀者，根本就不要看你這樣的洋洋大文。這並不是　我們是不應該寫這樣的理論。而是講我們應該把那些讀者使他們怎樣轉變過來。最低限度，我們不應把那些作者忘記根本不管。我們寫作我們的文章，他們寫作他們的文章，「河水不犯井水，」你們幹你們的，我們幹我們的，相揖而退，各行其是，或怒目相向，壁壘森嚴，前者的放任態度，與後者的敵對態度，這兩者都不是積極的辦法。我們應該設法和他們聯繫，我們卽不能把他們「扮入」我們的陣營，我們至少能够灌輸他們一點新的血液使他們消極地能把他們的作品中，那些十分有毒的成　　分盡量减少些，而對於抗敵的成分，多量增加些，我們從本港各副刊上，可以看出那些寫作者，在抗戰後，他們的作風，亦多少改變些。大時代的動盪，己無法把他們的陣地紮穩，他們也寫杭戰，雖則不純粹，可是故事的壳子裏，也把抗戰的事實，作爲串挿的材料，這訨明他們並不是不能推動的，問題是在我們如何冉進一步的努力。</p>
<p>講到這兒，我必得略加說明的，我上面講的那些舊作者，是行動純正的，至於那些日本謬種，漢奸文藝理論者，以及拿了老頭票的「王這」歌頌者，我們當取斷然的態度，予以無情的攻擊，使他們的毒素，不能像毒瓦斯一樣傳播開去，爲害人羣。我們覺得我們對于這樣一種重要的現實的問題，那就是對荒謬理綸的攻伐，我們還談得很少，逃避現實，就無異放棄我們的責任。來，我們把那望着遙遠星空的眼收回來，注視着當前的現實問題，一絲一毫也不讓它溜過去，遇有機會，我們共同作一個有力的表示，而給那些　論一個無情地圍剿。</p>
<p>上面所講的，比較是消積方面的居多，現在我還要提出幾項有積極意義的工作。文化人能够上前綫，對於抗戰的本身，有實際的帮助，這自　冉好也沒有。如果這辦不到，能夠在後方，就個人的本位內，對於文藝的創作有所貢獻，也是很有價値的事。中國文藝界不問在理論方面譯作方面，以及創作方面，都應養乏。拿槍的和拿筆的，在鬬爭上，都各有其重要的意義，「我們正不該菲薄自己。我們現在刊物下所見的，或者自己筆桿下所寫的，就一般講，都是分量上較輕的作品，而我們一大部分的時間，不敢說，都沒有浪費。我們自然不希望這樣無謂的浪費，長此繼續下去。我們希望在這比較安定的後方大家能够埋頭寫出或譯出較有系統，或分量較大有價値的著作。這就目前講，出版當然較困難，有些文化機關，根本不印書，或者就是印也是投機的書，或奢分量較輕的書居多。藏之名山，那也是一個聊以解嘲的辨法。講到這地方，我想到文藝工作者合作社的辦法，由作家自己集合起來自己來印自己販賣自己的著作，這樣組織，外國早巳出現，在中國，上海的復社，亦在去年有很好的成績。這樣的辦法，它的着眼點，不是在謀利，而是在發展文化，這意義自與其他專以營業爲目的的書店意義不同，而組織亦異。是値得我們幹而應幹的事。我們如果有精密的計劃，適當的分配，由國內老作家們加以良好的指導，再加上在同一目標下的刊物雜誌的經常批評介紹，我想一定可以在文化上有點貢獻。</p>
<p>這兒因社會環境的限制般寫作水準並不如我們所希望的那般高。多數熱烈向上的寫作者，或因爲年輪的限制或因爲修養的限制尚少特殊的成就，然而並不是沒有前途，自然希望那些負有指導之責的老作家，盡量給他們指導鼓勵，同時也希望他們多向國內名作家國外優秀作家學習，多一分努力，自然能多一分收穫。不要因爲有點成就而自滿，也不要因一次失敗而失望。個個人都應該勇氣勃勃，有極堅强的自信，甚至有一點自負。大概是德國作家克萊斯脫（Kleist）吧，他常常想把花冠從哥德的頭上摘下來。每一個靑年作家都應該有這樣抱負，這並不是講有這樣抱負就算，而是要有這樣抱負後，去努力達到。有成就，在文壇上成名並不是一件難事。雷馬克西線無戰事出版後，一夜就成名，他那時還住在瑞土，並沒有曉得他已成爲名人。文藝工作者們，大家努力吧。這個新動力的至來，就是新工作的發軔，也就是我們受了這鼓動的力量而開始努力的第一聲。</p>

<p>『什麽？』</p>
<p>『你想找一支手槍嗎？』</p>
<p>『你放心吧』！她又想：『危險的人，總是怕危險的』！因而，『手槍』給了她一種新的啓示——　　。她偷偷　找了一把野餐使用的尖刀，藏在大衣里，另外她帶了幾條手帕和一本琴羅，送利他的面前，　他用電同栓視。同時，她用一隻手握住尖刀的刀柄，攀一下撞穿他的喉嚨。在她用另一隻手去摸索他的衣領的時候，　了他：</p>
<p>『怎麽，你選有陰謀嗎』？</p>
<p>這啓音，像是鋼鐵相　而發生的，使他去摸索衣領的手，棉歡而抖動地掉落下來；因為她是弱者，弱者的理智，是控制不住冒險的行動的。但是，她的思想敏感的，她知道自已過去摸笨幸福而失敗的手，難免帶來不幸，需要把它安排在可以消滅這不幸的地方，以免自已遭到使多的磨難，於是，她把那隻手×移到他的胸脯上，揑弄着他的圍巾！她故意委屈地說：</p>
<p>『誰知道你還會怕我呢！』</p>
<p>『你的手，要做什麼！』</p>
<p>他立刻把她的手打開，而讓自己的手抵禦着她的接近。她更聰明，自動地後退些：</p>
<p>『我不過看看你的圍巾罷了……』</p>
<p>他相信了，感釗誤解別人以後的不安與慚愧；他以求恕的聲調問她：</p>
<p>『你想要我的圍巾嗎？你沒有嗎？』</p>
<p>她利用這種話頭，把話延續下來，她說：</p>
<p>『我有，可是找不到了！』</p>
<p>他把自已的圍巾取下來，給她圍起了，這是同情，但是浪費的，所給她的反應，不過是更深的反感和仇視，或是作爲一種欺騙以後的餘而已，雖然，她不住地表示着：</p>
<p>『謝謝你！』（十八）</p>
<h3 id="c78">今後的香港文藝運動 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 杜埃</p>
<p>抗戰以來，由各方面集中到香港來的文藝工作者，其數目是不能算少。報紙的文藝副刊比從前增加，藝術的圍地已在擴展着。但可以稱之爲『運動』的東西，却還沒有組織起來。前些時，許多文藝界的同志，已嚴重地注意了這現象，並一致認爲非迅速建立一種聯繫，去代替『各自爲戰』的渙散狀態不可。</p>
<p>遭種主張，在目前是充分反映客觀要求的迫切性，香港雖是一個特殊的區域，但這地方因爲緊接着華南，它之成爲我國的一個主要國際通路，就是在廣州武漢失陷後的今天，也還佔着相當的地位。就文化食糧方面說，它對廣東的東江和西南一帶也處於供應的地位，儘管這種供應的程度還做得很不够。近幾個月來，東江一帶的遊擊戰爭加速地發展，大批的靑年由香港跑進淪陷區去。這情勢的發展，使這裏的副刊就日漸增多的發現了來自東江一帶的文藝新兵的作品，在另一方面，因爲交通上的密切關係，內地的人們也盡可能的希望得到此地的文化食糧。上述這種情形，使我們文藝界方面的工作者明白的是：建立一個經常的聯繫，　這聯繫大家常務見面，交換一下寫作上的意見，不祗是香港本身的文藝運動所必需；卽對於內地也定能發生很好的作用。</p>
<p>爲了適應環境的需要，最近已有人在進行建立全國臨作家協會香港分會的工作。這是一件令人無限歡欣的事情，文協分會成立後，它將是香港文藝運動的有力軸心，是大家所期望的吧！</p>
<p>文藝界的統一戰綫問題，遠在數年前就被熱烈的討論着。抗戰發動以來，香港的從事於文藝工作的朋友，雖各自地把筆桿朝向了抗戰，但統一戰綫的組織。還未有建築起來。這次文協分會的成立，將要把這工作完成是無疑的。我們希望各種派別的作家，都匯合在這個分會裏，彼此取得密切的聯繫，大家親切的打成一片，爲共同的集業，携手進前。</p>
<p>戰爭的發展，正在迫切地要求着大批各種部鬥的工作幹部，所以經常的舉行文藝集會，培養大批的文藝工作幹部，也是目前的重要工作之一。此外，建立廣泛的通訊網，組設指導部，和內地作家建立新關係，出版機關刊物，經常報導全國各地的文藝運動情况，使各處的工作者在一條綫上相通，這都是應該馬上着手的工作。</p>
<p>×人的瘋狂進攻，雖把文藝的中心毀壞了，但新的文藝陣地却正在各處建築起來。文協分會的成立，不但將使香港文藝運動走上一個新階段，且對於保衛華南，也將起着有力的作甩的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Mongol Banners Since the War of Resistance Against Japan: Shakdurjab <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese × have been cunningly plotting, vainly attempting to use their military threat and political deception to destroy our country and exterminate our race, in order to achieve their aggressive ambition of monopolizing East Asia. Our highest authorities, in order to strive for national survival and territorial integrity, resolutely launched a nationwide war of resistance and entered the second stage of the National Revolution, which has lasted for more than nineteen months. During these nineteen months, thanks to the heroic efforts of our front-line soldiers and the unity of the people throughout the country, the Japanese ×'s conspiracy for a quick victory has been completely shattered. At the same time, our spirit of arduous resistance has won widespread sympathy and support from the world. All of our citizens deeply understand the importance of safeguarding international justice and national survival, and under the leadership of the supreme commander, we are concentrating our efforts to confront the Japanese ×. Since the start of the war, the × have become more and more trapped, while we have become stronger and stronger. Recently, the anti-war sentiment among the × army has been rising, and domestic uprisings due to repeated conscription have been occurring frequently. These obvious facts are signs that the Japanese fascist warlords are trapped in a quagmire from which they cannot escape, and they are also a guarantee that the final victory will belong to us.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned firm belief, the Mongol banner compatriots have always stood on their own posts since the war of resistance began, carrying out the sacred task of defending the motherland! Naturally, we do not deny that the cultural level of the Mongol banners is too low and all facilities are relatively backward. However, we Mongols have a heart full of loyalty to the government and support for the leader, determined to crush the Japanese ×'s conspiracy! In order to accomplish the great mission of resisting Japan and building the country, and to protect the glorious foundation painstakingly created by our ancestors, the Mongol banners have launched a wide-ranging anti-Japanese movement since the winter before last. As the Japanese ×'s frantic attacks and oppression intensified, the vast Mongol people suddenly awakened and set off a wave of anti-Japanese and national salvation, which spread rapidly throughout the western Mongol banners like a prairie fire. In the Darat Banner, in the Jungar Banner, in the County Prince Banner, in the Zasag Banner, and throughout the Ikhe Joo League, there were guerrillas carrying guns and riding horses everywhere, attacking the Japanese × every day and continuously striking the Japanese ×. People like Bai Haifeng, Han Yuchun, Ma Zixi, Naimudai, Qijunfeng, and Bayunying have all written glorious anti-Japanese × historical records.</p>
<p>If we open a map and take a look, we can see that the Mongol compatriots' determination to resist Japan is not accidental. On the one hand, it is certainly to preserve the integrity of our Chinese nation's territory. But from another perspective, the main reason why the Mongol banner compatriots were able to launch their anti-Japanese × movement so quickly and so universally and deeply was that after the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese × used the disappearance of Ishimoto as an excuse to invade Rehe, and then occupied Duolun, changing their tune and overturning the original league system of the Mongols, renaming it a province, in order to pursue their cunning plan of division and conquest. The four leagues and tribes of Jerim, Josooth, Zhao Uda and Hulunbuir fell into the hands of the Japanese × under this conspiracy! Later, the Xilin Gol and Ulanqab Leagues were also no longer ours due to the pressure of the situation. Now, only the Ikhe Joo League remains complete. Under the trampling of the Japanese ×'s iron hooves, the Mongol compatriots suffered greatly. Therefore, tens of thousands of Mongol people fully exerted their strength in the war of resistance under the call of anti-Japanese ×.</p>
<p>Although a very small number of confused people were temporarily instigated by the enemy to act as accomplices, like Prince De, who was young and weak and was surrounded and instigated by a few disloyal and unrighteous ministers and bandits, he willingly became a bridge for transitioning to the direct rule of the Japanese × bandits! No matter how much the puppets bowed their heads and flattered the Japanese ×, in the eyes of the Japanese ×, the puppets were not considered human beings. They could be killed or beaten at will. The shameless traitors did not know how much dirty air they had suffered from the Japanese ×. Therefore, many people with a sense of righteous indignation turned against them one after another. In the military, there were people like Battalion Commander Han Yuchun of the Jungar Banner and Regiment Commander Ma Zixi and Naimudai of the Darat Banner. In particular, in the past few years, several young people from the Ikhe Joo League, such as Qi Bizhang and Hua Deng, who were sent to Japan for further study by Prince De, had also deeply understood that Prince De's collusion with the Japanese was not only a disgrace to the nation, but also put their personal positions in imminent danger. Recently, they returned to the country one after another to participate in the sacred war of resistance. This shows that the failure of the Japanese × is not limited to the military side, and their means of winning people over have also been completely exposed. Now, the Japanese × have concentrated their forces in the Suiyuan-Baotou area, attempting to invade the west. But we have already anticipated this move. We have already organized the people of the Ikhe Joo League, who are at the forefront of the attack, into self-defense forces and guerrillas. The former is an armed organization of the people that does not break away from production, and the latter is an armed organization of the people that does break away from production. These more than 50,000 strong men living in the desert area have already inflicted many severe blows on the Japanese × in the vicinity of Suiyuan and Baotou and in places such as Darat Banner and Jungar Banner in the past. They have been trained into heroic warriors who have fought on the battlefield for a long time. Although they do not have new-style weapons, they have refined horsemanship and accurate shooting skills. During the war of resistance, the Mongol banner guerrillas used their agility and mobile tactics to kill and wound thousands of Japanese devils and consume countless ammunition from the Japanese ×, so that the Japanese × still dare not easily invade the Mongol banners. The people of the country should remember: the Japanese × are rampant and aggressive, and we are at a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. Anyone with blood and courage will give their lives for the country! The Mongol banners are an integral part of the entire Chinese nation, and we have a duty to resist Japan and save the country. We Mongols are determined to sacrifice everything and, in the wilderness of Inner Mongolia, will cooperate with the overall situation and work with the regular army to destroy all the Japanese ×'s poisonous schemes and conspiracies and bury the Japanese × in the desert! At present, we are working hard to strengthen the anti-Japanese armed forces, improve political institutions, and take unified steps to make the atmosphere of revolutionary resistance permeate every Mongol banner tribe, so that the anti-Japanese work can be strengthened day by day and achieve results. Our final victory will surely be realized soon because of the firm determination and progress of the Mongol banner's anti-Japanese work. Chongqing, February 23, 1939</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Week of World Trends <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From March 19th to 25th</p>
<p>The extremely turbulent world has appeared unprecedentedly tense and serious in the past week. On the one hand, the aggressor countries are taking an inch and wanting a mile. Following the fall of Czechoslovakia, there is the crisis in Romania and the annexation of Memel; on the other hand, the peaceful countries are being forced to unite. As a result, Britain is considering changing its foreign policy, the French president is consulting with London, and the US government's reorganization bill has been passed. At the same time, the Soviet Union, the guardian of world peace, has successfully concluded its 18th Congress of the Communist Party, and the democratic peace front has made further progress. Although our war of resistance against Japan has turned to a more difficult and serious stage, the struggle on the two fronts is becoming clearer, and the situation of national unity is becoming more optimistic. Victory is beckoning to our soldiers!</p>
<p>The Aggressor Group is Running Wild</p>
<p>The fascist aggression front is still developing in a mad and adventurous way. As they advance adventurously, the contradictions between Germany, Italy, and Japan are also developing. However, in order to promote a new imperialist war and re-divide the world, their collusion is becoming closer and more consistent!</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Since the German aggressors announced the annexation of Czechoslovakia last week, they have been sending troops eastward to use force to help diplomacy, seizing Romania's economic rights and interests and rich resources such as grain and oil, so that the "German-Romanian New Agreement," which actually deprived the country of its independence, was announced successfully this week. On the other hand, under the leadership of Hitler, the German aggressors marched into Memel on the morning of the 23rd of this month, issued an occupation order, and merged Memel into Germany! On the same day, Slovakia, which was officially announced "independent" and separated from Czechoslovakia last week, also signed a deed of sale, and concluded the German-Slovak Agreement with Germany, clearly stipulating that everything was subject to German control. So far, as a result of Germany's plunder in one week, the population has increased by 10 million, and the territory has expanded by 35 million square miles. Now they want to further attack Danzig, Denmark, and Belgium!</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Although the Italian aggressors have not made any major developments this week, they have already begun to drive the rebel army into Madrid on the 24th of this month by alienating the internal unity of the Spanish Republican government! Madrid, the democratic holy city that has stood firm for three years, has fallen into the hands of a few leaders of the Spanish government who "send anti-communists to compromise with the enemy." This is a major lesson for us. In the future, the vast masses of Spain who seek freedom will continue the more arduous anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle in close cooperation with the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which is an inevitable fact, and it is also a fact that the Italian aggressors are not satisfied with the spoils in Spain. It's just that if he wants to develop further in the future, he will inevitably have a direct conflict with Britain and France, and Italy's own strength is not enough to defeat Britain and France without the help of Germany. Therefore, he has to voluntarily be enslaved by Germany, and the Italian Fascist Supreme Council on the 21st of this month decided to continue to maintain the German-Italian axis to confront the "threat" of the democratic countries' united front. On the 23rd, the German newspaper also expressed that Hitler would support Italy's demands and wish Italy success without war!</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>Japan, which is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the war of aggression against China, is also eager to take advantage of the opportunity to step up its adventures when its Western allies succeed in their adventures. At the same time, because China's resistance forces are increasing day by day, and the Soviet Union's prestige and tough attitude in the Far East are also a "major threat" to Japan, and the voice of the democratic peace countries' united front makes the Japanese aggressors feel the danger of the future, they are eager to find new countermeasures. Therefore, there was an unprecedented five-minister secret meeting on the evening of the 22nd of this month, but it still ended without results and seemed to continue to consult. As for the Japanese × plan, the first is to adjust the cabinet after the current parliament is closed, drive away Konoe and recruit Katsuda and Tanabe into the cabinet to solve the financial and economic difficulties. The second is to further collude with Germany and Italy to realize the anti-communist agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan into a military alliance, threatening Britain and France in the Far East. The third is to carry out military speculation against China, supplemented by anti-communist and equal political conspiracies, and actively promote the military in central and southern China. Rapidly force our country to submit.</p>
<p>Democratic Countries Strengthen Unity</p>
<p>The call for democratic and peaceful countries to unite has never shaken the world as much as it has this week! And in fact, the movement to consolidate and expand the peace front has indeed had extremely important developments. First, Britain and France have discovered and recognized that the compromise diplomacy has harmed others and themselves, and must be abandoned, and there is a tendency to begin to take active steps to resist fascist aggressors. Second, the United States' policy of uniting democratic countries against fascism to defend world peace is becoming more firm and progressive. Third, the small countries of Europe have once again stated that as long as Britain and France are determined to unite and resist fascism, all small countries will decide to do everything in their power to support it. Now let's look at the trends of various countries:</p>
<p>Britain</p>
<p>The British government realized that Germany had destroyed the Munich Agreement, which was still wet with ink, and annexed Czechoslovakia, making Europe a world dominated by fascism, and the status of the British Empire would be seriously threatened. Therefore, it had to adopt a policy of uniting democratic countries to resist fascism. Such as declaring that it does not recognize Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, such as lodging a serious protest with Germany, such as recalling its ambassador to Germany, such as announcing that the cabinet has decided to maintain close contact with peace-loving countries around the world, such as the successful conclusion of the Soviet-Polish economic cooperation negotiations, such as the departure of Overseas Trade Minister Hudson to Moscow to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on political cooperation, Chamberlain also reiterated Britain's determination on the evening of the 23rd of this month, saying that "if Germany repeats its past actions, it will inevitably cause continuous resistance from Britain and other countries. If Germany threatens independent countries again, we will do our utmost to resist its attempts." Although the British government's attitude is not firm and thorough enough, the vast number of British people who seek freedom, and the increasingly important leadership of the Labour Party and the Communist Party, will become the main force in determining Britain's progress!</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>France's position is more dangerous than Britain's under the intensified attack of the aggressors. When Britain's attitude is still moving towards actively resisting fascist aggressors, France has issued many messages of preparing to resist aggression: what France is stepping up its war preparations, what is secretly implementing mobilization, what the French president consulted with London on the 22nd to discuss British-French military cooperation, what the French president is preparing to visit Roosevelt in the United States to discuss the great unity of democratic peace countries. However, we must not overestimate these messages. What is particularly important is that the French financial oligarchs continue to oppress their government, causing it to move towards a right-leaning and reactionary dead end. Now they are taking the opportunity to use the European situation to thoroughly abolish the 40-hour work week and the remaining better laws of the People's Front, and implement a high degree of exploitation of the working masses and the lower and middle classes. This policy will obviously help the fascist aggressors increase the French crisis from within! Fortunately, the vast number of French people are intensifying their struggle under dual oppression, and their leaders, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, also have a more united step. If the French government does not urgently move towards the anti-fascist road, it will definitely suffer a fatal blow!</p>
<p>America</p>
<p>The United States' anti-fascist and anti-aggression policy is becoming more firm and progressive. This week's facts are manifested in President Roosevelt's stern condemnation of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, and his call for democratic countries to immediately cooperate closely; the US government's formal sending of a letter accusing Germany of illegal violence; the US Treasury Department's abolition of the US-Czech agreement and the beginning of the implementation of economic sanctions against Germany; the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Pittman, proposed abolishing the Neutrality Act, which will be amended and passed with a majority of approval; the brewing of expanding economic sanctions against Japan, etc. are all. The US Senate also passed the government reorganization bill on the 22nd, giving President Roosevelt certain powers to promote his policies. From this, we can see that although the reactionaries in Britain who oppose President Roosevelt's progressive policies are intensifying their shameless and fierce attacks, under the unanimous anti-fascist upsurge in the country, this reactionary force is weakening.</p>
<p>In addition, many small countries that have not been annexed by fascism, such as Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey, are also actively promoting cooperation between democratic peace countries and the Soviet Union to implement a collective security system and defend world peace.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has achieved new major successes</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, which is completing socialist construction and moving towards communist construction, is the only strong and invincible democratic and peaceful country in front of this new imperialist war in which Hansis re-divides the world. This country has recently achieved another major success. The first is that the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was successfully concluded on the 21st of this month. The conference passed the proposal to expand the national economy's third five-year plan, passed the proposal on implementing the Soviet Union's new intentions to strengthen the party, government, and military forces, and passed the plan to develop national defense forces and oppose fascism, oppose aggression, and support the liberation movement of the people of the world and the anti-fascist movement. As a result of the re-election of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Gagano-vich, Kaganin, Manuilsky, etc. were all elected with enthusiastic support from the whole country, and General Grikoli Shute, who commanded the severe blow to the Japanese × in the Zhanggufeng Incident, was also elected as a member, which attracted more attention from various countries. This conference will have extremely important contributions to the Soviet Union itself and to the people of the world, and the Soviet Union's prestige in the world will also be greatly improved. Second, regarding Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union expressed its support for the British and French proposal to jointly discuss the European situation, and revealed that it would suggest immediately convening a joint meeting of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Poland, and Turkey. Therefore, the political influence of the Soviet Union's peace policy has gained newer, wider, and more significant development in Europe and even the world. Not only do many small countries in Europe and the Near East feel the urgent need to establish a collective security system advocated by the Soviet Union, but also the people, public opinion, and political parties in Britain, France, and the United States are eagerly demanding the immediate realization or strengthening of cooperation with the Soviet Union, and the British and French governments have to actually ask the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the European Union. On the 24th of this month, the British Overseas Trade Minister made a speech in Moscow, clearly stating that the Soviet talks were harmonious and of political importance. Third, the Soviet-Japanese fishing zone dispute. On March 15th, the Soviet Union resolutely rejected the Japanese request and implemented the sale of fishing grounds. Despite Japan's repeated threats to attack the Soviet Union, the facts now prove that the Japanese aggressors finally succumbed to the Soviet Union's solemn and tough expression. On the 24th of this month, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "The results of the fishery negotiations held in Moscow on the 22nd of this month are far from the compromise attitude adopted by Japan in the negotiations, but Japan is still determined to continue consultations with the Soviet Union"—this is the second Zhanggufeng Incident! It is another manifestation of Japan's submission to the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>The War Situation of Resistance Against Japan Turns Tense</p>
<p>The seriousness of the European situation has caused the Japanese aggressors to intensify their military adventures in China. Japan's submission to the Soviet Union shows the determination of the × to intensify the threat to force our submission! The reason why the Sino-Japanese war situation has become tense this week is a reflection of the Japanese ×'s military adventure plan against us.</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy in the war situation this week is the central China battlefield. North of the Yangtze River, the × army has taken a defensive posture in the Zhongxiang area, shifting its main force south in an attempt to forcibly cross the Xiang River. The × army on this side is attempting to contain our heavy troops in central and western Hubei. And cover the deployment of troops in its "Nanchang Strategy". Fortunately, our army has given full play to the strategy of mobile warfare, constantly counterattacking the flanks and rear of the × army, while avoiding concentrated large-scale battles on the front. As a result, the × army was dispersed by our various small units, while our main force is waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the main force of the × army. The war south of the Yangtze River and on the east line is the focus of this week's war. In order to carry out its "Nanchang Strategy", the × army concentrated its main force and launched a fierce southern attack from the left and right wings of the Nanxun Line, forcibly occupying Yongxiu on the 19th, forcibly crossing the Xiushui River from the evening of the 20th, and on the 23rd, the × vanguard troops crossed Anyi and Fengxin, attempting to encircle Nanchang. To date, the battle on the left wing of the Nanxun Line is in full swing. At the same time, the × army intensified its attack on eastern Zhejiang, bombed and harassed Wenzhou and other places with airplanes, and concentrated a large number of warships in the Hangzhou Bay and the coastal area of eastern Zhejiang. The × in Hangzhou also launched a large-scale forced crossing of the Qiantang River, looking eastward into Yin County and attacking Jinhua to the south, attempting to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and coordinate with the × attacking Nanchang. The × people's plan is that if they capture Nanchang, they can join the × in Hunan and Hubei to the west, drive straight to Changsha, open up the Guangdong-Han Road, and coordinate with the × in southern Guangdong to attack Guizhou and Yunnan. If they retreat, they can also cut off our hinterland transportation, strengthen the rule of their occupied areas in the southeastern provinces, actively rectify, plunder the people's strength, and then plan to advance. However, although the × people's conspiracy is fierce, we are not showing weakness at all. On the north side of Jiangxi, our reinforcements have been arriving continuously since the 20th, and now they are intercepting the invading × at a distance of more than 40 miles from Nanchang. And our army in northern Hunan has also launched a large-scale attack towards the southeast of Yuezhou. Our army on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has also been dispatched, directly attacking the flanks and rear of the × attacking Nanchang. In the eastern Zhejiang area, our army has strict preparations to protect transportation and intercept the × army. More than 1,000 × who forcibly crossed the Qiantang River have been annihilated. At the same time, our army on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has also gone north and south separately, intercepting the ×'s reinforcements to the north, and severely attacking the ×'s rear to the south. It is expected that the result of the × people's Nanchang Strategy will be the overthrow of their elite troops in central China. As for the northern war situation, in order to prevent the × army from being transferred to other battlefields and to give them a major blow, we have already launched a counter-offensive with all our strength. There have been fierce battles in the Jin-Chahar-Hebei border area for days, the guerrilla warfare in various parts of Hebei and Shandong has not stopped, our army in northern Jiangsu has counterattacked Huaiyin and Huai'an, and our army in western and central Anhui has also launched a counter-offensive, recovering Wangjiang. In southern China, the overall situation has not changed. However, the × people believe that the southwest is where the main force of our long-term resistance is concentrated, and there is also an important foreign aid transportation line, so they are secretly preparing for a fierce attack, which is what we cannot ignore when we are watching the war situation in central China.</p>
<p>This new offensive by ×× proves that under the increasingly favorable international situation, we must immediately prepare for further prevention and strikes against the Japanese ×. At the same time, it proves that all latent and overt anti-communist and pro-peace theorists' words and actions can deceive our people, alienate our unity, and cover up the ×'s cruel new offensive. In order to crush the × people's new offensive and the Han-good conspiracy, we must strengthen the front-line combat power in the military and develop guerrilla warfare behind the ×. The Party and Government Committee of the War Zone has been established in Pingzhou, and we hope to make greater efforts in this regard. In diplomacy, it is necessary to promote the world's peace front and strive for more foreign support. In the future, there should be more aspects of development. What is particularly important in politics is to strengthen national unity and implement centralized leadership of democratic politics. Now the People's Congresses in various cities and counties have been established on a regular basis, starting from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the provinces of Guangdong and Guizhou have been scheduled to be established one after another. We cannot but place earnest hopes on them, so as to realize the general mobilization of the spiritual and material strength of the whole nation through the promotion of civil governance, so as to complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Recent Developments in Shenzhen Rural Work <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Correspondent] "The strength of China's resistance lies in the countryside" is a well-said statement. In terms of manpower, according to general statistics, more than 80% of China's population are farmers. Out of every ten Chinese people, eight are farmers. This means that farmers account for 80% of China's manpower mobilization for the war of resistance. In terms of material resources, China is an agricultural country, and the majority of production still relies on farmers. During the war of resistance, the supply of grain depended on the diligent cultivation and harvesting of farmers. In terms of spiritual mobilization, farmers also possess the excellent qualities of perseverance, diligence, and integrity. These are the pillars of China's resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen Rural Welfare Association recognizes this strength and, in response to the demands of this objective environment, is determined to cultivate it. Therefore, in the early stages of the second phase of the war of resistance, it bravely entered the torrent of resistance with a spirit of serving the farmers with perseverance and dedication.</p>
<p>The founder of this organization is Mr. Chen Pishi. Mr. Chen has devoted even greater efforts to completing the entire work plan. The progress of all work is within his confidence and control.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen Rural Welfare Association was established around November or December of last year, shortly after the * Japanese troops withdrew from Shenzhen. However, the real work began in January of this year. All the staff are graduates of famous universities in the country, specializing in education, agriculture, crafts, and political science. They have the flexibility to adapt to the work and are more advanced in their work abilities than many other rural work groups.</p>
<p>There are many difficulties in developing rural work. When the "Welfare Association" started working, it first encountered:</p>
<p>1.  The conservatism of farmers has not been eliminated. For example, they are all law-abiding citizens. When it rains, they thank the heavens. When it doesn't rain, they only blame their fate. Because Shenzhen is mostly mountainous and does not have flowing rivers that can be fully irrigated, farmers have always waited for spring rains to start plowing. To alleviate the suffering of farmers, the "Welfare Association" planned and decided to build dams to store water. Naturally, they first sought the consent of the farmers and discussed the issues of manpower and material burden. However, when it came time to start, the farmers declined in various ways. They said: First, building a dam would hinder the passage of boats. Second, it will inevitably rain, so there is no need to spend so much effort building dams.</p>
<p>2.  The difficulty of raising funds. Because the development of rural work must start from helping farmers, Shenzhen is suffering from the * Japanese army's artillery fire. Without funds to help them in their displacement, it is difficult to start work. However, Mr. Chen Pishi said: "We have never worried about funding. What we are worried about is not doing the work well." Mr. Chen's spirit of working is also a manifestation of the great spirit of the "Welfare Association" in carrying out work under the nose of the * Japanese army.</p>
<p>3.  Shenzhen has its special environment, closely adjacent to the occupied area. Farmers are constantly alarmed, making it more difficult to mobilize work.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to carry out work under the nose of the * Japanese army, the "Welfare Association" has gradually overcome these difficulties. Now, it is showing a new attitude of growing in difficulty. As a reporter who has served with the association, I will give a brief report on the general situation of Shenzhen farmers:</p>
<p>Promoting Spring Plowing</p>
<p>There are thousands of farming households near Shenzhen. Due to constant * Japanese invasions, the losses have been quite severe. In terms of plowing cattle, according to statistics, there were more than 700 in the past, but now there are only more than 60. The number of differences between them is more than 600. With more than 60 heads of cattle distributed to thousands of households, it is usually not enough to distribute. During the spring plowing season, when every household starts plowing at the same time, the distribution of cattle is obviously lacking. The "Welfare Association's" plan for relief is: First, buy or rent as many plowing cattle as possible from the outside world and distribute them to farmers for use. Second, rush to build reservoirs and irrigate the possible irrigated paddy fields with river water. At present, Shenzhen farmers can use cattle one after another, which alleviates the shortage in distribution. The "Welfare Association" has also received donations of many excellent seeds from Honolulu and the Philippines, which are distributed to every household. The method of manufacturing fertilizer and the method of cultivating straw mushrooms are guided by Professor Lin Lichat of Lingnan University in different regions. Rural loans are also in progress. At present, the rural areas of Shenzhen are showing a vigorous scene day by day.</p>
<p>Running Primary Schools</p>
<p>Every village in Shenzhen has a primary school. Since the * Japanese invasion, most of the teachers have fled, and the students have been forced to wander around aimlessly, and education has become stagnant. The "Welfare Association" runs two primary schools there, one in Caiwuwei and one in Getian. The purpose is to help out-of-school children. First, there is no tuition fee, and the books are distributed by the Welfare Association. Second, the library is established by collecting books from the outside world and students. Third, the content of the teaching materials is letters, abacus, wartime knowledge, political speeches, farming, and singing. The situation of the school is probably like this. At present, there are more than 300 students in total, from the first grade to the sixth grade, and there are also special classes (junior high school level).</p>
<p>Rescue and Military Affairs</p>
<p>After the "Welfare Association" arrived in Shenzhen, in addition to running primary schools, it also implemented wartime education for adults. In terms of rescue, there is protection against poison gas, bandaging, and applying medicine. In terms of military affairs, there is guerrilla warfare, defense, air raid prevention, and evacuation plans. In terms of farming, there is fertilizer manufacturing, soil improvement, and mushroom cultivation. The farmers of Shenzhen are gradually becoming active and will pierce a sharp knife into the chest of the * Japanese army.</p>
<p>After the great work has been launched, Shenzhen, under the nose of the * Japanese army, has become a strong fortress of resistance. In order to have a vivid expression of the facts, the "Welfare Association" has also received a lot of sympathy and donations from people from all walks of life. The Hong Kong government and our government have also given it strict encouragement and sympathy. Under the crazy bombing of the * Japanese army, Shenzhen has become a ruin. The grocery stores have also suffered from the fire. The farmers of Shenzhen are living a more miserable life. However, the "Welfare Association" still stands like a rock, carrying out planned work. The following is an excerpt of its current work plan:</p>
<p>1.  Establishing Collective Farms - As a result of the discussions between Mr. Chen Pishi, the founder of the association, and the local government of Dongjiang, it was decided to establish a collective farm between Dongguan and Bao'an near Shenzhen in the near future to accommodate farmers who have been displaced by the war of resistance. It is said that the plan is similar to the "Sichuan Border Reclamation Group" launched by Mr. Zhu Wuqing in Sichuan. The refugees in Shenzhen, who have suffered from bombing and fire, may have a place to return to.</p>
<p>2.  Establishing Rural Cooperatives - In order to meet the current requirements of the war of resistance, the association decided to establish cooperatives in ordinary rural areas to participate in wartime production to help relieve refugees, adopt group production and consumption, and eliminate the exploitation of usury by parasites in rural areas.</p>
<p>3.  Organizing Farmers and Arming Farmers - In order to penetrate deep into the rear of the * Japanese army, the association will step up the work of organizing farmers and arming farmers to increase their work development and assistance.</p>
<p>4.  Expanding Work - At present, the association's work has only expanded from Shenzhen to Changping, Longhua, and Nantou. The region is still very limited. In order to expand its work, the association is planning a movement to expand the work area. "We have never thought about when the work will end." This has become the association's slogan.</p>
<p>Shenzhen, Nantou, Dongguan, ... have become active in the rear of the * Japanese army. Armed farmers are growing up under the artillery fire of the * Japanese army. It is inserting a sharp sword into the chest of the * Japanese army. This is a great victory in the second phase of the war of resistance. (Minge Society)</p>

<p>Composition of Ore Deposits</p>
<p>The Baoxing Sanyuan Liangfei Cave is located in the mountain stream forest of Daihuangkou, about ten miles from the mountain peak and about six miles from the foot of the mountain to the Rongyao Road. The road is narrow and steep, making it difficult to climb. At the foot of the mountain, there are two tablet-style smelting furnaces of the Sanyuan Factory and many forging ponds. Not yet completely destroyed. The factory is located one hundred and twenty miles from Rongjing County and five hundred and fifty miles from Chengdu. Copper must be transported out through a dry foot road of two hundred and ten miles before reaching Ya'an, and then transported by car to Chengdu or by boat to Jiading. The ore beds mined by the Baoxing Sanyuan Liangfei Factory are all in the shape of vertical columns, which the locals call vertical heart mines. The columns are small at the top and large at the bottom, forming a sea-style shape. It is said that the local method of pumping water has reached forty-eight bamboo tubes, but the tubes are not all upright. It is estimated that the depth of the excavation has reached about forty zhang. According to the chemical experiments conducted that day, the copper content of the ore is about 10%, which is two and a half times higher than the average copper content of 4% in the Dashishan copper mine in Baishuihe, Peng County. The copper-producing area around Sanyuan Factory is wide. The Hehegang Factory in the east of the factory and the Qianxi Mountain belly in the west of the factory have obvious outcrops. The Dou Doudi, twenty miles north of the factory, was once mined by Kaiyuan Iron Factory. Its vein is eight miles long, twenty miles wide, and one foot and five inches thick. From this, it can be seen that the economic value of the copper mine in the northern Rongjing area is significant.</p>
<p>Smelting Method</p>
<p>In the past, copper smelting was done using local methods. The forging pond is in the shape of an armchair, with a height of six feet and a diameter of nine feet and a width of eight feet. The first step is to forge the ore with charcoal fire, which takes about ten days. The second step is to forge the ore three times, roast it three times, and beat it three times, which takes about three days. After the copper liquid solidifies, it is dragged away with wooden sticks. The first few calendar years of extraction are water copper, the next few calendar years of extraction are nao copper, and then the next one is zheng copper. The third step is to calcine ice copper. The forging pond is smaller than the ore pond. Lay the layers and turn them over and burn them five times. Copper beads must be found on the surface of the ice copper. The fourth step is to flow copper. It is smelted in a furnace, the door is closed, and the wind is drawn until it turns red. Finally, it is refined in a reverberatory furnace to obtain 99% refined copper. It has been found that if the Rongjing copper mine is mined and smelted in large quantities, it can produce 15 to 20 tons of refined copper per day. However, the ore calendar has not been accurately inspected. If a new smelting method is used, the government must send geological experts and mining experts to conduct multiple surveys before it can be discussed. During the current period of resistance, there is a great and urgent need for refined copper, and the development cannot be delayed. The general opinion is that the copper mine in the mountain stream forest of Daihuanggou, Rongjing, should be tried by the Kang Provincial Government, and the budget for the preparation of funds is 100,000 party-state currency. As for the copper mines in the front and rear Jubazai in Rongjing, it is best to encourage private operation by the provincial government! If the capital is insufficient, the province will advance a part of it. In this way, the people will be eager to prepare for the copper market, and the province will assist in the establishment of funds, and they will surely be eager to prepare and start work first, and the large amount of copper that can be obtained can be asserted.

<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] Xu Bingying of the puppet First Army Li Ying's unit revolted in Xiaoyang Village near Linzhang on the 25th of last month, killing two Japanese consoling squad leaders, one named Degen Saburo, and the other whose name is unknown. He also killed the Japanese adviser Sato of Li Ying's unit, Wang ×kuai, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment of the First Brigade, Chang Wenming, the ordnance officer of the regimental headquarters, Lieutenant Guan Lu Yaotang, Second Lieutenant Luo Ao, and Wang Yunce, etc. of the brigade headquarters, a total of six people. He then led more than 1,000 men, with complete weapons, and surrendered to our army. Also, Yang Fengcai of the puppet army revolted with 500 men in Linzhang on the 28th of last month. He also defeated a regiment of the puppet army and captured a lot of prisoners. He has now arrived at Jichu and joined a certain unit of our army. It is reported that the Jichu officials have sent personnel to console them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] Zhang Xingchen's unit, the puppet commander-in-chief of the Party Rescue Army in eastern Henan, has recently completely collapsed. According to investigations, there are four reasons for this: (1) There were three Japanese staff officers in Zhang's unit. Because one of them overstepped his authority, the other two Japanese were dissatisfied and complained to the * Japanese chief Sugiyama in Beiping. Sugiyama ordered that the name of the unit be cancelled and that it be ended immediately. (2) Sugiyama of Xiang sent Zhang Junchen 5 million yuan, but 4 million yuan was seized by our guerrillas near Zhongxiang, causing Sugiyama to be furious and dissatisfied. (3) Zhang did not go to Beiping to explain after losing the money. (4) The Great Heavenly Master Kowtow Society, etc., under the jurisdiction of the puppet Party Rescue Guard Army, have all dispersed. It is also rumored that the * Japanese side will detain Zhang. This is also the fate that Zhang Ruo deserves.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 25th] There is no major change in the * Japanese situation in western Suiyuan. However, the puppet Mongol army in Baosa and other counties in Panshou has repeatedly shown more anti-* Japanese sentiment. The * Japanese are terrified and have transferred 2,000 infantry and cavalry troops from Zhangjiakou to guard Baosa and closely monitor the situation. According to investigations from various sources, the * Japanese army's increase in troops in Baosa this time is purely to prevent the puppet army from revolting and has no intention of invading the west.</p>

<p>[Hong Kong News] After the * Japanese army invaded and occupied Guangzhou, they immediately began to wantonly burn and kill people. Majestic buildings were all destroyed by the * Japanese army's artillery fire. Since May, the entire city has become a field of rubble, and dilapidated buildings are desolate everywhere. According to a person who was recently forced into military service by the * Japanese army and escaped back to Hong Kong,</p>
<p>Since the provincial capital fell, dozens of them were detained by the * Japanese army and forced to work for military transport. During the day, they were forced to do hard labor, and at night, they were forced to burn down houses. If they disobeyed, they were whipped. Dozens of partners could not bear this inhuman life and were arrested and returned after escaping. They were often shot, so they were really badly treated by the * Japanese army and were trapped in a city of sorrow all day long. It was difficult to live, and it was even more difficult to die. Only one meal a day was provided, and they were all rotten meat and rough food that could not be swallowed. In order to survive, they had to endure humiliation for the time being and wait for an opportunity. On the 21st of this month, three * Japanese soldiers forced them to build fortifications in the Baiyun Mountain Airport and other places to prevent our army from counter-attacking. Because of this, they saw an opportunity to take advantage of the * Japanese soldiers' unawareness and beat them to death. Only then did they get this opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>There are very few * Japanese troops invading Guangdong now, and most of them are old and weak, and the team is disorganized and unlike soldiers. An old * Japanese soldier once said to them that he (the * Japanese army) was not a soldier, but was forced by the warlords, so he had to invade your country. He was very reluctant to leave his parents, wife, and brothers. Soldiers like them missed their hometown very much. Their parents were looking forward to their return. He hoped that peace could be achieved soon so that he could reunite with his family and never be a soldier again.</p>
<p>He also said that recently, our planes have been flying over Guangzhou from time to time to bomb. A few days ago, eight of our planes flew over the Humen Taiping airspace and bombed * Japanese warships and * Japanese positions. Just when the * Japanese army was being transferred, the * Japanese army saw our planes circling in the sky and hurriedly fought back with anti-aircraft guns, firing aimlessly at our planes. For a time, the sound of bombs and guns reverberated through the sky. Our planes dropped dozens of bombs in a row, all of which hit the target. Three * Japanese warships sank on the spot, and more than 1,000 * Japanese soldiers also died under the bombs. At the same time, many * Japanese positions along the coast of Humen Taiping were destroyed. The night before he left Guangzhou, near dusk, our magical response team, the amount of which was unclear, flew over Humen again, circling for a few minutes, and fiercely dropped dozens of heavy bombs on the Shatoujiao fort and the * Japanese warships in the nearby sea, before flying away safely. Seven * Japanese warships were heavily damaged and two sank on the spot. Countless * Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, and a part of the Shaqiao fort was destroyed. At the same time, at 9:15 pm that night, our planes flew over the Jiulong Road area to scout for a long time, and then dropped bombs on the Taipingchang area until late at night, before completing their mission and returning to base safely. In recent days, our guerrillas have been very active in the suburbs of Guangzhou, constantly attacking and sabotaging the * Japanese positions and defenses, making the * Japanese exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Doude Has Not Been Found; Foreign Newspapers Condemn the * Japanese Side for Specializing in Hostility Towards Foreigners <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A dispatch from abroad stated that the Zilin West News commented on the kidnapping of Doude, the president of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, saying that Doude had been kidnapped for more than a week, and all parties now felt increasingly uneasy about the security situation in North China. It is no wonder that foreigners in the Japanese-occupied areas of Tianjin have moved into the British-administered concessions. However, one thing that must be noted is that Doude was kidnapped in the Japanese-occupied area, and we have reason to believe that Doude is still being detained in the occupied area. All of this proves that the Japanese side has no ability to maintain security. Since Japan itself cannot maintain order in its occupied areas, its recent accusations that foreign authorities in Tianjin and other places are incompetent are unfounded. Assuming that the Japanese side can first pay attention to maintaining security in the occupied areas and not specialize in hostility towards foreigners, the Doude kidnapping case may not have occurred.</p>

On Thursday night, he suddenly went mad on a train in Yokohama, drew his saber and rushed into a second-class carriage, slashing wildly, killing one person and injuring six. It was obviously caused by excessive stimulation and nervous breakdown. The Vice Minister of the Military Department expressed regret over this unfortunate incident. At the same time, Army Minister Itagaki has ordered several army doctors to rush to the scene of the incident to treat the injured.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 25th] A warehouse of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) shipping company here suddenly caught fire at midnight last night and was completely burned down. The warehouse, located across the Suzhou Creek from the Japanese Consulate-General, contained a large quantity of cotton and chemical raw materials. After the fire started, the chemical raw materials exploded. Japanese troops immediately dispatched a team to surround the warehouse and prohibit pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 25th] Japanese officials are carefully investigating the fire at the NYK warehouse on Huangpu Road in Hongkou, suspecting arson because the warehouse contained newly arrived cargo. Senior Japanese military and government officials held an emergency meeting at noon today to discuss the matter. When the fire was raging at midnight, the French Consulate sent three fire trucks to Hongkou to assist. The fire was extinguished by 1:30 AM, but the smoke was very heavy. The amount of the loss is currently difficult to estimate. Japanese newspapers claim it reached one million Japanese yen and believe that the losses were entirely borne by the NYK. Documents from the consulate and police station were evacuated, but property could not be salvaged. However, some documents were damaged by wind and snow during transport. It is rumored that the police station of the Japanese Consulate has temporarily established an office at the New Asia Hotel.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, 25th] According to a Domei News Agency report, a fire broke out at the NYK warehouse on Huangpu Road in Hongkou at around 11:00 PM on the 24th, reducing the six-story brick building to ashes. At around 12:00 AM, the fire spread to the neighboring Japanese Consulate-General Police Station to the south. Boundary police, fire brigades, military police, marines, and garrison troops rushed to the scene to rescue. By 12:50 AM, the fire had weakened, but at around 3:00 AM, it flared up again, affecting part of the main building of the Japanese Consulate-General. It was quickly extinguished. A portrait of the Emperor was carried out by Japanese Consul Kato and moved to the Central Elementary School. It is rumored that all important documents from the completely burned down consulate police station were evacuated, and the cause of the fire can be determined to be a planned act by anti-Japanese elements. Therefore, Consul General Miura, Colonel Hirota of the Army, Lieutenant Commander Mitsunobu of the Navy, Lieutenant Colonel Igarashi of the Military Police, Deputy Director Akagi of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and others held an emergency meeting at the Consulate-General to discuss countermeasures. However, according to general observations, the act was carried out by Japanese anti-war elements.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent: Geng Ya</p>
<p>Taking a car through a district that has this type of cave dwelling, with dangerous cliffs above and deep streams below, is truly a bit frightening. However, according to a friend, Mr. Wang Zhenhai, most of the bandits in the border area between Henan and Shaanxi have a connection and possess the spirit of Liangshan Marsh, standing up for the wronged, and the awareness of the Gelaohui Society to "Revive Han and Destroy the Manchus." In certain secret social strata, there is still a popular question: "How many large and small strands are there in the hand-held flower umbrella?" The answer must be: "Thirty-six large strands, seventy-two small strands, one hundred and eight pleats." This alludes to the story of the 108 heroes of Liangshan. Another question: "How heavy is the bundle (baggage) on your back?" The answer must be: "Two catties, thirteen taels, five qian, and four fen." This secretly refers to the lost Ming Dynasty Jiangshan, with two capitals, north and south, thirteen provinces, and the four seas and five lakes. There are many more secret languages containing the consciousness of "Revive Han and Destroy the Manchus" circulating in the Jianghu world. If we utilize them properly, we can certainly transform them into slogans for "Resisting Japan and Building the Nation" and implement them together.</p>
<p>Shangxian County is an important town in Shaanxi adjacent to the border area between Henan and Hubei. When the car arrived in the county seat, the streetlights were already on, and citizens came in droves. After getting in the car, we entered the county from the West Gate. There were many vendors on the side of the road, each setting up a paper lantern night market. From a distance, it looked like two bright pearls were placed on the side of the road. Slogans such as "Down with ×寇 (Japanese bandits)," "Down with ××× (Japanese) heads of state," and "United Front, Strive for Final Victory" were written on the lanterns. While admiring the lanterns, we also encountered two columns of lantern ball parades. However, although the vendors were as crowded as a swarm of bees, the goods they sold were only large pancakes, roasted peanuts, and boiled eggs with wine, only three or four varieties. The large pancakes, as big as dustpans, stood next to the lantern balls, not only tempting the appetite of passersby but also boasting the bumper harvest of the first phase of the war of resistance. We visited the county magistrate but did not meet him, so we returned to a hotel outside the city. The military police had already opened our luggage for inspection, indicating that the security here was also very strict.</p>
<p>On the third day, the car passed through the Qinling Mountains, a branch of the mountains guarding Xi'an. We drove uphill for forty li, and near the top of the mountain, the Chunxue Pass, the spring snow had not yet melted. It was also forty li downhill. We arrived in Lantian like a meteor. We could have reached Xi'an that day, but unfortunately, the car had a problem. We spent a lot of effort pushing and dragging it, and in the end, we still stayed in Lantian.</p>
<p>Although the conscription lottery in Lantian had already been held four times, there were still brothers with four siblings who had not finished the drawing. There were brothers with three siblings and two siblings. They were all rubbing their fists and preparing themselves. Since last spring ×, whether in cities or villages, there has been a surge in the number of marriages. Their goal is to have "offspring," so that "someone at home will be able to hold the flag" - this is a reflection of the preparation of these strong men for × work. However, they still use the wasteful ceremonies of large gifts and blaring suona horns from the past. In particular, when the newlyweds first enter the bridal chamber and drink the joint cup of wine, the groom must stand tall on the bed and circle above the bride, adorned with flowers, with his legs, as if he were a reconnaissance plane, spinning in circles. There are many rumors about the meaning, but these are all outdated customs that should be eliminated.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, we drove past thousands of acres of green wheat fields, enjoying the unique product of Guanzhong along the way - flocks of cranes soaring and dancing. In the long sound of the all-clear siren at noon, we arrived in Xi'an, the only ancient capital left in our country today.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also encountered a good opportunity, and we will be able to go to the Yellow River defense line in northern Shaanxi immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e19">The New Army Established in Battle <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from the Aviation Front in Mount Heng</p>
<p>The first phase of the war of resistance used space to buy time, consuming ×'s people on one side and covering the transfer of people and industries from coastal and riverside provinces to the interior on the other. The second phase of the war of resistance must not only buy time but also maintain space. It aims to obstruct × on one side and enable the rear to concentrate all manpower, material resources, and financial resources, strengthen the strength of the war of resistance, and refresh the offensive lineup on the other. The latter is the most difficult period in the war of resistance in China.</p>
<p>The most urgent requirement during this period is the establishment of a new army, and the most important task is also the establishment of a new army.</p>
<p>Resisting Japan and building the nation is the great cause of the entire Chinese nation. "Building the nation requires building the army." All the people of the country have unanimously joined various departments participating in the war of resistance under this supremely glorious banner; especially the young and strong, thousands of farmers and workers have put down their tools and formed a new army; thousands of educated youths are receiving training suitable for their respective branches of the armed forces. They are like metal ores just out of the tunnel, forged into steel in a large furnace, and have become a torrent of iron.</p>
<p>However, because × is better equipped than us and the extension of the battle line has broken new records in modern warfare, we need a superior force to confront × on the line. We also need more and more armed forces to occupy, expand, and secure areas. In fact, we are not allowed to have enough time to train new soldiers in the rear. We are not establishing a new army in battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that even regular troops who have been trained for a long time have suffered considerable losses in the past twenty months. Whether the new army, which has just grasped the rifle and is facing the battlefield for the first time, can bear the current heavy responsibility is still a question. This question, in principle, is not without reason, but in fact, it can be concluded otherwise.</p>
<p>Recently, the author found the following examples from conversations with conscription workers, new soldier training personnel, lower- and middle-level military officers who command new soldiers in combat, and the new soldiers themselves.</p>
<p>Why has conscription currently broken through the difficulties and can achieve inexhaustible results in troop dispatch? The fundamental reasons are: first, political mobilization has enabled the majority of the people to understand the meaning of survival only through resisting Japan. Second, political reform has enabled conscription to develop universally, reducing the worries of conscripts, and making reasonable and fair conscription methods simple and effective. Although there are still a small number of people who evade conscription, that is only a manifestation of the timidity of a few individuals. The number of people who avoid conscription due to poor conscription management is gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>New soldiers are often sent to the front line for reinforcement or combat after a very short time in the rear for training because the front line needs a large number of soldiers. In the past, a large number of new soldiers deserted in the rear. In addition to the reasons for evading conscription, the instructors still could not abolish beatings and scoldings, and military life was even harder than family life, which caused resentment among some self-respecting soldiers and soldiers from relatively wealthy families. Now, prohibiting beatings and scoldings has gradually become the absolute principle of new soldier training. Political work for new soldiers is also actively seeking to eliminate their emphasis on material and spiritual life, especially political awareness. This has enabled them to overcome their attachment to their homeland and their homesickness and bravely step onto the front line of resisting ×.</p>
<p>According to lower- and middle-level military officers, new soldiers who fled on the battlefield or were timid in combat are no longer found in the second phase of the war of resistance. Even if there are any, they are only a very small minority. Because the soldiers who have not deserted after being conscripted and trained mostly have the determination to sacrifice for the country, have long put life and death out of their minds, and because of the change in tactics, the advantageous terrain, and the extreme mobility, × is unable to exert its superior weapons. Due to the reduction of casualties and the demoralization of ×'s soldiers, the notion that new soldiers die as soon as they go into battle has been overturned, and the psychology of fearing × has been corrected. They know that fighting does not necessarily mean death, and the chances of survival are very high. × are not three-headed and six-armed, but just some guys who are more afraid of death than themselves. All of this has boosted the morale of the new army. For example, when new soldiers discover × traces in front of the battle, they often open fire without asking whether × has entered the range. After the experience of actual combat, they know that when × does not enter the firing range, it makes × accelerate to approach the firing range. If they wait for × to enter the firing range, then once they are suppressed by a tight fire net, they will scurry away. They know how to respond calmly. Also, regarding the use of poison gas by ×, in the past, new soldiers would know that it was poison gas as soon as they saw a smoke screen rising in front of the battle, and they would be greatly stimulated mentally. Now, even if × uses poison gas, they know how to use the terrain to temporarily avoid it in high places. (In the first phase of the war of resistance, every soldier of × had a gas mask, but now an average of only one gas mask is available for every four or five people. Therefore, they often poison themselves due to wind direction.) As for artillery shelling or aerial bombing, our side suffered considerable damage and was severely threatened by gas when defending positions. Currently, because of the use of deep deployment, not focusing on one line or one point, its power has been greatly weakened. It is common for × artillery to fire hundreds of rounds, while our side only suffers a few casualties. ×'s air force is also unable to find targets, even if they carry out indiscriminate bombings, our losses are also small. The timid psychology of the new soldiers no longer exists, and killing × and achieving results has become a certainty.</p>
<p>Because the new soldiers are not trained enough in the rear, they are trained day and night in front of × after entering the battlefield. A certain unit on the south bank of the Xiu River is practicing shooting in front of ×. Even all training other than formal training is held in front of ×. They are growing rapidly. The lower-level officers, such as squad leaders, platoon leaders, and company commanders, pay special attention to "being a person," and although there is a difference in rank between them and the soldiers, they are affectionate and sincere, like brothers or teachers and friends. When a soldier who is new to the battlefield is performing guard duty, the squad leader or platoon leader often accompanies him to the front and teaches him how to be vigilant and how to retreat, and says, "Don't be afraid here, I will come to see you later." After less than three months, they gradually become brave and alert sentries. Examples like this are countless. In terms of clothing, because the need and the supply are very different, a small number of new soldiers often do not have uniforms, leggings, or straw sandals when they first arrive at the front. They know the country's difficulties and have no complaints. The original brothers want to give them their old military uniforms, tear their torn military uniforms into leggings, and share their old shoes with them. This spirit is the essence of the new army.</p>
<p>The new army still needs to be strengthened in training in terms of skills, but in terms of morality, it is purer than the soldiers of the recruitment era. They are truly the people's army, able to get along well with the people, and there are few problems in maintaining military discipline. At the same time, because an army without political consciousness is bound to be a rabble, the military authorities are injecting the blood of politics into the new army. Currently, each regiment has ×× political workers. In the near future, there will be × thousand workers serving as political instructors in each company. This new blood is our force for counter-offensive, and it will bring to bear its great spirit to destroy the current ×!</p>
<p>What is reported here is only a small part of the infantry aspect. We know that China is establishing a new army in many ways. But from here, we can extrapolate to others. Knowing these things, we can be sure that the sentence "The final victory is ours" will never be empty.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Movement to Stop German Aggression: Negotiations Underway Among Nations, U.S. Secretary of State Issues Statement of Reproach, Italy's Future Status Draws Attention <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today to condemn German aggression, saying: "Recent changes in Europe are a real threat to world peace. I am truly surprised by this new evidence of international illegality, and it is becoming increasingly clear and undeniable that we must cooperate with law-abiding and well-behaved countries to establish effective economic relations. The United States is determined to continue to strive to strengthen world peace through the rule of law and economic relations, and in fact, only economic relations can create peace." Note: Hull has just returned from a vacation in Florida.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] The "Stop Hitler" movement is now deeply mired in diplomatic negotiations, and there are also differences of opinion among nations. Germany is rapidly moving towards complete control of Europe. Hitler's arrival in Memel with his fleet is like a chance occurrence in ancient times. Since Germany and Slovakia signed a 25-year agreement, Germany has been able to establish important military bases within Slovak territory. All parties believe that this matter has three meanings: First, it forms a vanguard for Germany's invasion of Poland, which is the most important point. Second, it places Hungary under German control. Third, it strengthens Germany's various important military bases for invading Romania. The completion of the German-Romanian agreement allows Germany to develop industries and exploit Romania's resources. Germany's aggressive actions have clearly tended towards the Black Sea. Since the Italian King issued an edict, people here have attached great importance to Italy's position in the new European situation. Since Hitler annexed Memel, Germany has had a tendency to encircle Poland, threaten Lithuania and the Baltic countries, and invade Romania. Therefore, it is believed that Poland, in this environment, is unlikely to join the anti-Hitler group. This week, anti-aggression countries have been using diplomatic means as much as possible to discuss ways to deal with Hitler, but Hitler is still disregarding everything and actively carrying out actions to encircle the small countries of Central and Eastern Europe. However, the eyes of those countries have turned to Italy. Italy has been exhausted after invading Abyssinia and participating in the Spanish war and sincerely desires peace. The general opposition to Britain and the Soviet Union joining hands is afraid that after Britain wins over the Soviet Union, it will become hostile to Italy and reduce the hope of peace. Therefore, they advocate turning to Italy to make peace in order to maintain peace. According to some other opinions, the Italian King's edict is actually a prelude to Italy's request for financial assistance from Britain, and this request is the price of Franco-Italian reconciliation.</p>
<p>The Danzig Issue Will Become More Serious</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] Hitler returned here yesterday afternoon. Hitler's speech in Memel, in which he said, "The unfair treatment of our people must be revised. I believe that the revision work can now be considered largely complete," has become the center of discussion in political circles here. Political circles have not given any explanation to this statement. At the same time, in view of the recent situation, whether the Danzig issue will become more serious has not been explained, but it is believed that important issues have been resolved one after another, but the unfair treatment of the Treaty of Versailles is still considered not completely corrected. Political circles here are convinced that Danzig's return to Germany is only a matter of time, and the date of its resolution will be compared with the issue of the "Polish Corridor." The solution to the "Polish Corridor" issue will start from the negotiations on the German-Polish non-aggression treaty. As for the other aspect of "revising other injustices," the issue of demanding the return of colonies is crucial. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Goebbels are also said to be following in Goering's footsteps and taking leave to go to Italy. Madrid and Valencia may be occupied by Franco's troops a few days later. At this time, Mussolini may make his colonial demands to France. According to the "German Digest," the solution to the Franco-Italian dispute will be to re-establish the balance of power in the Western Mediterranean and make Spain the fourth great power in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 25th] After Hitler arrived here by train, he immediately rushed back to the Fuhrer's residence. The crowds cheered for Hitler's achievement in breaking the treaty. After the United States prepared to stop German aggression, Germany seemed to want to insist on its political and economic aggression plan. Officials announced that the German-Belgian trade negotiations, which began on March 17, have now ended perfectly, and customs cooperation in Lithuania is also being planned. The Latvian government has planned to levy a special tax in the country in order to carry out military expansion and construction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th] German Aviation Minister Goering, who is currently resting in Saint-Remo, recently made a speech to a reporter from the Italian People's Daily, saying in brief, "I hereby declare again that no matter what accidents happen in the future, Germany will definitely help Italy, no matter what the price. I will go to Rome to pay homage to Prime Minister Mussolini and then go to the Libyan colony in North Africa to visit Governor Balbo."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Valencia, 28th] According to officials close to the government, rumors that the peace agreement has been reached and that Franco will enter Madrid this Saturday are completely unfounded. However, according to reliable sources, the delegation of the National Defense Council, which conducted talks in Burgos, has now returned to Madrid, expressing that the process is very good, but the government has not yet issued an official bulletin, and the government is still discussing it. The delegation will also return to Burgos soon to continue negotiations. According to another reliable but unconfirmed report, Franco's delegation recently held discussions with government officials here, but a general peace agreement can be concluded in a short period.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 24th] Rumors that the delegation of the Republican government arrived in Burgos and signed an agreement with the Franco government to surrender Madrid have been officially denied.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Burgos, 25th] The rumor from the French border that Franco's troops had entered Madrid on Friday afternoon has been officially denied here.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] According to senior Franco officers on the French border, a representative of the government army arrived in Burgos by plane yesterday and offered to surrender. The only condition was to find a way to allow 17,000 government army personnel to leave Spain, but they did not agree to surrender Valencia and the other nine cities. Franco refused to accept, so he is about to begin a counter-offensive.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Labour Party Member of Parliament Mr. Kirkwood believes that when he raises questions in the House of Commons on the 28th regarding the aviation and shipbuilding industries, the response from the Secretary of State for Commerce, Mr. Stanley, will imply that the government has subsidies to assist the aviation and shipbuilding industries. He told reporters today, "The Secretary of State for Commerce, Mr. Stanley, has asked me to raise this issue. If he did not have an important answer, he would not have asked me to raise this matter."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Bratislava, 25th] After Hungarian military aircraft bombed the towns of Kiežmark and Spišská Nová Ves, inhabited by Germans in eastern Slovakia, it is generally believed that the war situation has undergone drastic changes. Hitler is now fully aware of this conflict and seems to be considering taking decisive measures. The German government here lodged a second protest with the Slovakian government on Thursday, and the contents of the protest were also sent to Ribbentrop to be forwarded to Hitler. The leader of the German population, Karmasin, rushed to Vienna and then to Berlin to report.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Slovakian Capital, 24th] According to recent reports arriving from eastern Slovakia, Hungarian forces are now beginning to withdraw from Slovakia. The temporary ceasefire on the Slovakian front appears to be influenced by suggestions from Berlin. Berlin advised Slovakia not to begin the counteroffensive originally scheduled for this morning, in order to give Hungarian forces the opportunity to reorganize and withdraw. The withdrawing Hungarian forces stated that their plan to occupy southern Slovakia had been prevented by Berlin's diplomatic intervention. It is reported that Slovakian troops are still closely defending the border.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] According to a report from the Havas Agency in the Slovakian capital, Hungarian troops have launched an offensive against Slovakian strongholds. Slovakia also claims to have entered Ruthenia. The two armies clashed in the rain throughout the day. Slovakian aircraft heavily bombed Michalovce, where oil depots and armories were destroyed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Slovakian Capital, 24th] Official sources have announced that Slovakian and Hungarian troops continue to fight fiercely today. It is reported that Slovakian troops have repelled Hungarian forces, and both air forces are very active. A communique states that Hungarian forces have heavily bombed various areas in the Slovakian rear, with seven bombers attacking Kiežmark and Spišská Nová Ves. However, the extent of casualties is currently unknown. The situation in the Slovakian capital remains tense, with the general population fearing the possibility of Hungarian aircraft bombing the city.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Hungarian Capital, 25th] The local official newspaper, "Esti Ujság," believes that the Hungarian invasion of Slovakia is justified. The newspaper stated that Hungarian forces occupying border areas would create a natural border that is suitable for both countries' geographical situations and shared interests.</p>

<p>[Rome, 25th] Well-informed sources here say that Mussolini and Franco have concluded negotiations, agreeing that Italian troops in Spain will remain in the country after the Spanish Civil War ends. Under the provisions of this new agreement, Italian troops will remain in Spain and will not be withdrawn. Mussolini will also send military advisors to Spain to "strengthen" the Spanish army. If this report is true, then Mussolini is not respecting the promise he made to Britain and France that Italian troops would be withdrawn immediately after Franco's forces achieved victory. Mussolini has repeatedly stated that the purpose of the Italian army in Spain is to ensure that the Spanish Republican government does not achieve victory. According to reports from Franco's government, three representatives of the Spanish Republican government have arrived in Burgos, intending to arrange for Madrid to surrender peacefully before the weekend.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Burgos, 25th] The French ambassador to Franco's government presented credentials to the government. Franco replied that he vowed to work loyally towards friendly cooperation between France and the Spanish Revolutionary forces.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Today, the German government announced a new financial plan to pre-collect taxes from industry and commerce. The purpose of this measure is to enable the German government to pay its extraordinary expenses. The pre-collected taxes will be issued by the government as tax certificates, but they will not pay interest. Official sources claim that this measure is intended to cover the expenses of provinces, cities, railways, post offices, highways, and other judicial organs. Industry and commerce must comply with the order to pay and take these tax certificates, and issuing public bonds is only an exception. From May of this year, previously maturing public bonds will be abolished, and income tax will also be increased again. All those with annual income above 2,400 marks must pay additional income tax. The value of these tax certificates will increase over time, increasing by 1.5% after three years. German Finance Minister Reinhardt said that Germany's tax revenue was 6 billion marks in 1933 and has increased to at least 7.5 billion marks in 1938. It will increase further in the next two years. Reinhardt stated that Germany's national expenditures are significant, and raising funds in this way does not require the government to pay interest. These expenses will be shared by the people of the country over decades.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] The "News Chronicle" here reports that Japan is now planning to return the Caroline Islands to Germany to express friendship and set an example for countries holding former German colonies.

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Semi-official political circles are currently discussing the possibility of Germany regaining a colony, namely Jiaozhou Bay. Jiaozhou Bay was occupied by Japan during World War I and then returned to China in 1922. Now it is back in Japanese hands, and Japan is quite willing to transfer it to Germany. The only difficulty at present is how to hand it over without affecting German-Japanese friendship.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Illegal Collusion Between Germany and Japan <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 24th stated that German political circles are discussing the possibility of Germany recovering its colony in the Far East, namely Jiaozhou Bay. Jiaozhou Bay was occupied by Japan during World War I and returned to our country in 1922. It fell into Japanese hands again two years ago. Now, in order to strengthen its collusion with Germany, Japan is even considering handing it over to Germany. Its illegality and shamelessness are naturally condemned by the world. Recently, Japanese × has intensified its collusion with Germany and Italy, and voices for the establishment of a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance have risen again. On the one hand, it is also bending its knees to seek peace with the Soviet Union, which is practicing communism. It can be seen that the Japanese aggressors, in view of the fact that a long-term war will lead to the collapse of Japanese × imperialism, are indeed preparing to further oppress our country, attempting to quickly "conquer" our country with maximum force. However, the anti-communist and pro-peace advocates are still shamelessly covering up this shameless behavior and aggressive conspiracy of the Japanese aggressors, which is something that every Chinese person with a sense of justice should not tolerate.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Burning Debt Movement <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong, the Seamen's Union is scheduled to hold its second burning of national defense bonds and provincial defense bonds on the 29th of this month. Participants also include the Amateur Friendship Society, the Chinese Clerks Association, Zhenhua Middle School, etc. I wonder what the few shameless people who profit from national debt (see the article "The Storm of Deducting Salaries to Buy Prices" in the Hong Kong News section of this newspaper on the 24th) think about this.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong burning debt movement was first initiated by the Seamen's Union, and various groups and individuals actively responded. Together with the one-dollar debt repayment movement, it is a high expression of the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and can also be said to be a concrete manifestation of the spiritual mobilization of overseas Chinese. The burning debt movement can reduce the government's debt and strengthen the economic strength of the war of resistance; the debt repayment movement can enhance the government's credit in the international community and stimulate people's enthusiasm for supporting the government's unity in the war of resistance. We should not only pay the greatest respect to the overseas Chinese who actively participate in this movement but also spur ourselves to encourage our relatives and friends to participate enthusiastically!</p>

<p>Open a map of Europe, and you will see a narrow strip of land; its northeast leans on Lithuania, its southern border adjoins East Prussia, and its west is the raging waves of the Baltic Sea. That is Memelland, which is attracting worldwide attention today.</p>
<p>A brief history of Memelland: It originally belonged to Germany, was seized by Lithuanians by force after the war, and today it has been seized back by Germans by force.</p>
<p>Although Memelland is only a small place, it has been a key issue in previous international disputes. When Central Europe was in crisis last year, Chamberlain paid a visit to Germany and also discussed Memelland with Hitler at length. Whether today's facts are the consequences of that conversation, who knows.</p>
<p>After the end of the Great War, Memelland was under the control of the Allied powers, with French troops stationed there to maintain order. At that time, Lithuania had just broken away from Russian domination and was growing up after the war.</p>
<p>By 1923, armed Lithuanians repeatedly harassed the French troops stationed there. The French commander protested to Lithuania on the one hand and appealed to the Allied powers for help on the other. The British fleet immediately sailed to the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>But it was too late. Several thousand Lithuanians drove away two hundred French soldiers and formally seized Memelland. The following year, Lithuania promulgated the Memelland Code, allowing Memelland a portion of autonomy. Britain, France, Italy, and Japan also agreed to guarantee Lithuania's territorial integrity and Memelland's autonomy. This situation was then considered to be generally recognized. In fact, this decision by the Allied powers was really a forced cover-up because Lithuania's territory, Vilnius, had been forcibly occupied by Poland, and they had also reluctantly acknowledged it.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Memelland was entirely in the world of Lithuania. Many place names and street names were changed from German to Lithuanian, hoping to prevent German residents from longing for their homeland. This seems to have been quite successful. In those years, there was indeed not a single pro-German voice. At least, the demagogic expert Hitler had not yet come to power at that time.</p>
<p>By 1933, not long after Hitler came to power, the people of Memelland began to long to return to the embrace of the German Empire. Propaganda and advocacy sprung up like mushrooms after the rain.</p>
<p>By 1934, Lithuania, seeing the situation was not good, sent a large army into Memelland, arresting more than one hundred German leaders and key members, accusing them of plotting to restore Memelland to Germany. Four people were sentenced to death, and hundreds were sentenced to long-term imprisonment.</p>
<p>Naturally, Hitler immediately launched a strong protest, with a tense atmosphere. Lithuania had to soften and commuted the death sentences to imprisonment.</p>
<p>The current "Memelland Hanren" Neumann was one of those sentenced to death. He was later changed to twelve years in prison, but he was released after only four years. In the middle of last week, he was able to wear a dark blue uniform and knee-high boots to flaunt his power in Memelland.</p>
<p>Neumann's opponent is the high-cheekboned Lithuanian President Smetona, who, like Poland's General Pilsudski and Czech Republic's Dr. Beneš, is a revolutionary hero who liberated his country from foreign oppression. His target is Russia.</p>
<p>When he was young, he was expelled from school for refusing to pray in Russian and using Lithuanian. When he entered St. Petersburg University, he became a member of the Lithuanian independence movement.</p>
<p>In Memelland, Smetona does not have much power, because in the local council, the German party occupies 24 of the 27 seats. They all adopted the Nazi salute, cheered Nazi slogans, and organized Nazi stormtroopers.</p>
<p>The air in Memelland is always uneasy. Conflicts between Germans and Lithuanians are constantly occurring. In a major conflict in June last year, the two sides fought on the streets for two hours, resulting in the death of a sixteen-year-old Nazi youth and the injury of more than fifty people. This disturbance made Europe very nervous at the time, with a sense of impending doom.</p>
<p>Later, the storm dissipated—only on the surface.</p>
<p>Last September, after Chamberlain visited Germany, a member of the British House of Commons asked about the situation in Memelland. Chamberlain's answer was: Hitler said that if the Lithuanian government can always abide by the Memelland Code, he would be very happy for Memelland to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Pay attention to this sentence: "If the Lithuanian government can always abide by the Memelland Code..." It is easy to find an excuse, even if it is said that the Lithuanian government can no longer abide by the Memelland Code. At least, the residents of Memelland already regard themselves as an oppressed minority.</p>
<p>After the Munich Agreement sold out Czechoslovakia, Hitler personally said that he no longer had other territorial demands. But a few days later, Berlin semi-officially said: This does not mean that the head of state has forgotten his deep concern for Germans outside Germany.</p>
<p>Then in October, Berlin began to attack Lithuania, saying it was oppressing Memelland Germans.</p>
<p>Later, things became clearer. The vice-leader of the Memelland Nazi Party, Berti Le, even gave a speech to the Memelland press: "The separation of Memelland from its German homeland violates the wishes of the Memelland people. Now we all demand to return to Germany. The upcoming election is an expression of public opinion; the demand for Memelland to return to Germany is unstoppable."</p>
<p>As expected, the result of the election was that the Germans swept through like fallen leaves, achieving complete victory.</p>
<p>Hitler's move to incorporate Memelland into East Prussia will not encounter much resistance. Memelland is destined to follow the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Finally, it went that way. —Translated from the 24th edition of a Spanish newspaper—</p>

<h3 id="e37">Southwest Import and Export Center: Hong Kong-Shantou Relations Growing Closer; Large Quantities of Inland Produce Shipped from Shantou to Hong Kong; European and American Goods Enter Mainly Through Hong Kong and Shantou <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since the change in the situation in South China, the land and water transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been affected and cut off. The maritime route, which used to go from Hong Kong to Hankou, has shifted to Yunnan-Burma-Vietnam, but the main sea route to Shantou in eastern Guangdong has been maintained throughout. Goods between Hong Kong and Shantou flow smoothly as before. Due to the urgent needs of the times, Hong Kong-Shantou relations are becoming increasingly close. Whether in commerce or economics, they have been greatly expanded compared to before. Evolving to this day, it has become the main center for the exchange of internal and external goods. Agricultural, mining, and local products from provinces such as Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan are concentrated in Shantou in large quantities, then transferred to Hong Kong, and then shipped to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia in batches. The European, American, and Southeast Asian goods, products, and factory products sold to the mainland are also concentrated in Hong Kong, transferred to Shantou, and then transported to Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces through the Shantou highway network. Under this situation, not only is the Shantou market prosperous and active, developing a prosperity rarely seen before, and all industries are thriving day by day, but also the benefits to Hong Kong are also huge.</p>
<p>Domestic Grains Shipped in Large Quantities from Shantou to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The most important of these is the supply of daily necessities for residents of Hong Kong, nearly 90% of which rely on Shantou. Since the outbreak of the war of aggression by × army in South China, although there is still a line of communication between Hong Kong, Macau, and the interior, due to the heavy obstacles in land and water transportation in the interior, all vegetables, livestock, and other local products cannot be transported to Hong Kong via Macau. When the war in Hainan broke out, the supply of various grains from that area was also cut off. The huge amount of daily necessities needed in Hong Kong had to rely solely on Shantou. Therefore, in the past three months, the quantity of vegetables, peanuts, soybeans, sesame, potatoes, wheat, chickens, ducks, and livestock transported from Shantou to Hong Kong has been increasing day by day. Each shipment arriving in Hong Kong contains more than tens of thousands of dan of the above-mentioned grains. Fortunately, the supply of grains in Hong Kong is not affected by the impact of the situation, and the source is entirely dependent on this. As for domestic products such as tung oil, ore, and other industrial products, most of them are also transported from Shantou to Hong Kong for export. According to people in the Hong Kong-Shantou trading houses, due to the route, Hong Kong and Shantou currently hold the reins of our country's export routes. Yunnan-Burma-Yunnan-Vietnam are still behind.</p>
<p>Imported Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Shantou</p>
<p>Because the highway network of the seven provinces in the Southwest terminates in Shantou, since the completion of the widening of the Shaoguan-Shantou highway, the connection between the southwestern provinces and Shantou and Hong Kong has been further enhanced. The products of the provinces are transported via Shantou and Hong Kong. It is more convenient than the Yunnan-Burma-Yunnan-Vietnam trunk lines. Whether it is products from Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, etc., taking the Shantou route to the sea shortens the journey by dozens of times compared to the Yunnan-Vietnam route, and the cost is naturally saved. The cost of various products shipped from Shantou via Hong Kong to destinations such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States does not increase excessively, and the sales volume is not affected. Therefore, domestic merchants mostly transport various local products for export via the Shantou-Hong Kong line. As for European and American goods imported from Hong Kong into our country, because the sea route between Hong Kong and Shantou is twice as short as the route between Hong Kong and Vietnam or Hong Kong and Burma, a large number of goods are shipped from Hong Kong to Shantou and then transferred to various provinces in the mainland. The volume of foreign goods from various countries transported from Hong Kong to Shantou has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. Therefore, the business of Hong Kong and Shantou trading houses is thriving and expanding day by day, and the products produced by Hong Kong factories and transported to the southwest provinces via Shantou are even more huge.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Increase Hong Kong-Shantou Liners</p>
<p>As Hong Kong-Shantou cargo transportation becomes increasingly prosperous, foreign shipping companies in Hong Kong believe that the opportunity for the development of the Hong Kong-Shantou line has come, and increasing the number of liners on this route is necessary. According to shipping companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, in order to adapt to the demand for Hong Kong-Shantou cargo transportation, they are implementing the addition of ships traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou. It is estimated that there are currently ships directly sailing to Shantou from companies such as Dodwell &amp; Co. In addition, ships from companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and other companies traveling on various Southeast Asian routes also take Shantou as a central station, directly reaching ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., before heading south to Hong Kong. The ships of the Java Shipping Company, which travel between Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, and Japan, also pass through Shantou. Now, with the great increase in the volume of goods traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou, various shipping companies are paying close attention to competition in their own industries, hoping to seize the right to transport goods. Therefore, in addition to striving to expand the number of liners traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou, various companies are also competing for direct routes between Shantou and places such as Siam and Singapore. The situation is already becoming acute. Because the volume of products transported from Southeast Asia to China is increasing greatly due to the high demand, and there is also a huge number of domestic products transported directly from Shantou to various parts of Southeast Asia, Shantou has become a very important part of our sea route, providing no small amount of assistance to overseas relief during the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, the conspiracy of × people to blockade our sea route is also being strongly attacked and completely shattered.</p>

<h3 id="e40">××××××! Japanese Goods Imported into Hong Kong Increase Greatly: Exceeding 1.75 Million Yuan in January; Not Including Those from Other Places and Smuggled in <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Japanese goods in the Hong Kong market gradually disappeared due to the impact of the war in the autumn of 1937. By the spring of 1938, the value of goods had dropped from a peak of over 7 million yuan to over 1.267 million yuan. This degree of reduction was equivalent to that during the January 28th Incident. Afterwards, it suddenly and gradually rebounded, and then decreased again to over 880,000 yuan in September. After this period, the value of goods sold to Hong Kong has remained at around 1.2 million yuan. In January of this year, the import of Japanese goods increased to 1,751,228 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Most Japanese Yarn Imported <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Among them, building materials accounted for 26,811 yuan, Chinese medicine accounted for 54,585 yuan, coal accounted for 115,000 yuan, and food accounted for over 110,000 yuan, including fish (55,500 yuan), potatoes (2,780 yuan), vegetables (1,590 yuan), spices (12,500 yuan), and shiitake mushrooms (36,300 yuan). Paper products accounted for 54,800 yuan, and fabrics and cotton yarn accounted for over 1,197,000 yuan, including cotton yarn (144,800 yuan). In the sundries category, hats accounted for 5,161 yuan, socks accounted for 2,100 yuan, shirts accounted for 3,965 yuan, undershirts (vests) accounted for 2,071 yuan, towels accounted for 2,600 yuan, handkerchiefs accounted for 6,380 yuan, bedsheets accounted for 3,900 yuan, along with other daily necessities, totaling over 129,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Total Import Value Still Difficult to Calculate <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The above statistics are based on officially imported goods inspected by customs. Goods transported through other methods and locations are not included. Various items are necessary for our daily lives and are often overlooked. General speculators often take advantage of this. Although the statistics for February have not been released, the total amount has been confirmed to exceed that of January. British goods, on the other hand, show signs of decline. According to reliable sources in the business community, the statistical figures are difficult to represent the total value of Japanese imports. Furthermore, the import of certain countries' goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong is enough to strike a blow to local Chinese merchants in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>According to investigations by this reporter, foreign goods businesses will face danger this year. A prominent figure in a foreign goods business told the reporter that if the situation of × occupying Guangzhou is not broken, foreign goods businesses will simply have nothing to be optimistic about this year. Taking the spring season as an example, the current sales are down by one-third compared to last year. In previous years, foreign goods sales were mostly for various felt products, especially red felt. This year, the sales of red felt from the three major foreign companies are far less than in previous years. As for the Hong Kong market, locally woven cotton yarn sells better, while among foreign goods, only foreign sewing machine needles have some sales.</p>

<p>Since Hong Kong joined the complete airmail agreement for first-class mail in British territories, all first-class mail sent from Hong Kong to British territories is transported by Imperial Airways planes, which is faster than before, and senders feel it is more convenient. In order to expedite delivery, the postal authorities not only send mail to British territories by air, but also, after consultation with Imperial Airways, first-class mail to non-British territories can also be transported by Imperial Airways planes to the British territory closest to the delivery location, and then transferred to the destination. For example, mail to non-British territories in Africa and the Near East is transported by Imperial Airways planes to Alexandria, and mail to non-British territories near Australia is transported to Australia and then transferred. The postage rates are also stipulated as follows: for non-British territories in the Near East and Africa, letters are one dollar and postcards are fifty cents; for foreign countries via Australia, letters are one dollar and postcards are fifty cents; for Afghanistan and Portuguese India, letters are seventy-five cents and postcards are forty cents.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Nautical Feat: Foreigner Huino-Kuroff Plans to Sail a Yacht to Australia; Encountered a Storm in the Philippines; Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday to Go to Shanghai and Try Again <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huino-Kuroff, a foreigner from Shanghai, has worked on steamers on the Yangtze River for many years, so he has a wealth of navigation experience in the river. On February 1st, he sailed a Chinese-style yacht with a crew and ten curious people, planning to sail to Australia from Shanghai. At that time, the Shanghai newspapers reported on the matter in detail. When he arrived at the coast of Northern Luzon in the Philippine Islands, the entire ship was in ruins. At the same time, Huino-Kuroff also believed that there were too many people on board. According to Huino-Kuroff, the ship was only capable of carrying seven people, but this time it carried eleven people, which was excessive. Furthermore, the ship was in ruins, so he decided to abandon it. He recently returned on the President Pierce from Little Luzon and arrived in Hong Kong yesterday (the 24th). He will transfer to a ship to return to Shanghai during the day. Huino-Kuroff told reporters yesterday about his voyage: "We left Shanghai on February 1st. Two days later, we were attacked by pirates. The pirates were divided into many yachts and opened fire on us from all sides. We also carried two long guns and fired back. Our ship was hit by three bullets, but no one was injured. The ship was equipped with a motorcycle engine and traveled faster, so we were able to escape safely and continued to sail to Little Luzon. We encountered storms twice near that place, and everyone was seasick, but no accidents occurred. It was our luck. When approaching the Philippines, we got lost again. Fortunately, we saw mountains in front of us and moved forward. It was getting dark, so we anchored near the coast. At night, the waves rose greatly, and the anchor was ineffective. The ship was washed ashore by the sea. We tried our best to take care of ourselves and our belongings. At that time, the wind and rain were heavy, and the waves were surging. Although we repeatedly tried to escape from the ship with our lives, we were unsuccessful. The hull continued to hit the rocks and was completely destroyed. The other people on board are still in the Philippines, including two dancers from the DD nightclub in Shanghai. They plan to raise 1,000 Philippine pesos and buy another yacht to sail to Borneo, New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand."</p>

Therefore, Liang Houyuan, a representative of the Chinese in Macau, proposed and sent a letter to the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, inviting them to organize an inspection team to Macau to plan the development of industry. The Macau government has expressed sympathy for this and has promised to provide convenience. Furthermore, products produced in Macau can enjoy preferential tax rates when sold in Portuguese territories. For this reason, the Manufacturers' Association submitted a proposal to the board of directors a few days ago and resolved to invite the Director-General, Han Sui-xuan, to go to Macau to handle everything. Mr. Han has now returned to Hong Kong to report to the association. According to Mr. Han, this trip has been successfully negotiated with Mr. Liang Houyuan, the Chinese representative in Macau, and the main principles for establishing factories have been discussed. The results are very satisfactory. As for the trip of the inspection team, it will be around mid-April. After Representative Liang negotiates with leaders from all walks of life in Macau, personnel can be sent to Hong Kong next week to discuss and decide on all matters.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying Allocates 20,000 Yuan to Build a Health Room</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Holy Confucius Church Children's Convalescent Home held its inauguration ceremony at the church on Caroline Hill yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Attendees included Zhu Ruzhen, Xu Shiying, Situ Yongjue, Wang Xiao, , Du Yuesheng, Mao Heyuan, Cao Shanyun, Lei Yin-sun, Cai Chang, and hundreds of male and female students from various schools.

First, the chairman announced the reasons for the opening and reported on the preparations. President Zhu Ruzhen gave a speech, stating, "Our country has long been accused of being the 'Sick Man of East Asia'. If we do not quickly revitalize its decline, we will have no way to protect the survival of the nation. The establishment of the Children's Convalescent Home is based on this. Currently, refugee children are gathering in Hong Kong, and charitable organizations have been trying to accommodate them. However, there are many talented people among them. We have now selected dozens of people, provided them with free education, and provided them with meals and accommodation. We will teach them the principles of Confucius and vocational education to promote our country's inherent culture and enable them to have noble morals and strong physiques in the future. Each of them will use their skills and intelligence to serve society and the country."

The photo session and adjournment took place at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Chengdu Bishop Hoad Talks About the Development of the Yunnan-Burma Road in Hong Kong; Hoad Had Surveyed the Route from Yangon to Yunnan <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Bishop Hoad of Chengdu recently came to Hong Kong for business. Yesterday, he spoke to reporters about the situation on the Yunnan-Burma Road. According to him, the Yunnan-Burma Road is of great importance to both China and Burma. It has now become an important international route in the world. In the past, merchants from both countries often traveled and traded on this route. However, it was rugged and difficult, and it took many days. After the improvement and development, it has become a way for China's western fighters. The proposal to build this road did not start today. Knowledgeable people have been talking about it for fifty years, but the timing was not ripe. At the beginning of the year, Hoad rode in a Red Cross ambulance from Yangon to Kunming on this road, and was very impressed by the inspection. From Yangon to Mandalay, the first section is 400 miles, and the road is flat. After reaching Mandalay, continue north, and twenty miles away, it is already steep. From here to Kunming, the road runs over the tops of mountains. Twenty miles ahead is the Shan State of Lashio, which is the end station of the Burmese railway. It is estimated that the highway from there to the Chinese border was completed in the 19th century, but it was only for military use. The railway from Mandalay to Lashio had to be compensated for the cost of construction, so the fare was particularly expensive. From Mandalay onwards, the road is extremely winding, and the axles that pass through cannot exceed one ton in weight. As for overweight vehicles, they can pass through another road. This road is jointly managed by the Chinese and Burmese governments. Without special government permission, free passage is not allowed from Mandalay to Lashio and Kunming. From Lashio to Kunming, the road is subject to inspection. Fortunately, we had notified the governments of both countries in advance, so we were not hindered in any way and received their sincere guidance and special passes. The transportation matters on this road are all managed by the Southwest Transportation Company.</p>

<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>—— Reflections on the Writing Process of a Revolutionary Historical Drama</p>
<p>Paying the utmost respect to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle to establish the Republic of China for the National Revolution!</p>
<p>Drama is a popularized record of the act of struggle; without struggle, there is no drama. All great battles in history are the best material for plays, and all great dramas are manifestations of human strife (rather than reproductions).</p>
<p>The link in history of Huanghuagang, which moved heaven and earth, is precisely the most humane and the most flesh-and-blood reality. It is the most dramatic. However, it is a complex historical process, containing deep historical legacies and the relationship of social contradictions at the time. It contains diverse personalities and rich emotions. Only drama can express that great spirit, which is a historical tip and a social crux. But precisely because it is complex, diverse, and full of intrinsic meaning, the writing process of such a historical drama is also very complicated and tortuous.</p>
<p>Twenty-two authors from the Guangdong Drama Association once engaged in this experiment with collective effort. Although the results may not be necessarily good, in the various difficulties discovered, they understood many things they did not know before. At least, in the sense of historical analysis, this is a good method of self-education for drama workers.</p>
<p>The completion of the four-act, six-scene historical drama "Huanghuagang" by twenty-two people within three days is still a miracle in the history of Chinese spoken drama. None of us participated in that battle, nor were any of us contemporaries. Our grasp relied on science—the most correct way of thinking for understanding social history. First, we discussed the position of the "Huanghuagang Uprising" in the history of national revolution, the reasons for its inevitable occurrence, its attributes, its inherent weaknesses, and its significance for today's war of resistance. After reaching the same conclusion, we began to have the rudiments for selecting materials and the criteria for tailoring. Secondly, we began to collect materials. General history, revolutionary history about the narratives of the March 29th Uprising, special history of March 29th, books studying the social situation at the time, martyrs' posthumous works, descriptions of each martyr... as well as paintings, poems of the time, were all materials that we had to study and absorb, in addition to regular common sense and knowledge.</p>
<p>We began to turn this event into a story with a beginning and an end, with flesh and blood. Among these were main plots. The rest were embellishments and insertions. The main plot was nothing but the struggle between the revolutionary camp and the counter-revolutionary camp. The result was the revolutionaries' failure, so this is a historical tragedy.</p>
<p>This failure is one of the glorious milestones on the road to success. It can not only allow later generations to learn the lessons of revolutionary failure, but also show that it was a powerful cause for the birth of the Republic of China on October 10th. Therefore, what dominates the whole play is by no means the inertia of defeatism, but the overflow of the great revolutionary spirit; in an inevitable setback, it sets off the inevitable success of the revolutionary future. We wrote about the inadequacy of the revolutionary camp's organization, heroism, the principle of fighting to the death, and even the prevailing of generous sentimentalism. We wrote about the mistakes in strategy and the sabotage of internal traitors, but mainly we wrote about the greatest revolutionary emotion, also the greatest of human emotions in drama—sacrifice. We wrote about the incompetence and debauchery of the Manchu Qing rulers, and their delusion of "rather giving it to foreigners than to domestic slaves," but we also wrote about their internal contradictions (which was one of the reasons for their ultimate failure), and their unity and superiority in dealing with revolutionary forces (which was the reason for the setback of the March 29th Revolution). Everyone has their own personality, which is a typical trait of a part of the people and a symbol of a phase of society. Everyone has their own contradictions in their personality, but many people will have their commonalities.</p>
<p>The perspective on events, the composition of stories that conform to historical facts, and the creation of personalities full of motive are the first and foremost steps in writing revolutionary historical dramas. The collective creation of Huanghuagang can serve as an example. At least a bad example.</p>
<p>The Huanghuagang incident is a flower opened by the blood of heroes, and the Huanghuagang script is a flower of drama opened by an era of blood.</p>

<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>5. The Art of the Actor</p>
<p>"Selflessness" and Half a Self</p>
<p>The art of the actor is to play a person with oneself, to express the body and soul of the character in the play with the actor's own body and soul. Because of this, some people advocate that when the actor is engaged in the creation of performing arts, they should completely deny the existence of the self and must achieve the so-called realm of "selflessness," to "spiritually disguise," in other words, to forget oneself and transform one's entire personality, even one's body, into the personality of the character in the play.</p>
<p>This theory is valid in principle. It is necessary to do so to become an artistic performance. However, to complete this work, it is impossible to deny the existence of the actor's own personality. We do not oppose the highest achievement of performing arts, which is that the actor dissolves the self into the character's personality. However, the completion of this work is also the actor's own artistic creation, which is the result of usual training and cultivation, and cannot be achieved simply by discarding the existence of the self.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the actor's performance on stage is to convey the emotions that must be conveyed, thereby arousing the audience's sympathy and completing the resonance effect of art. However, the emotions conveyed are not "the emotions of daily life." They are not real, but false, artificially created emotions, and the appropriate expression and verisimilitude of these false emotions inevitably require a kind of power to control and manipulate.</p>
<p>Because emotions must be controlled and manipulated, as mentioned above, the actor must be able to control his attention, able to become the master of all his expressions and actions, and the only master is the actor's own brain. Therefore, the actor's own existence cannot be entirely denied.</p>
<p>Therefore, the actor's work on stage is dualistic; it has two personalities. What is expressed is the personality of the character in the play, but behind this illusory personality lurks "half a self." This invisible, latent half-self is like the puppeteer, controlling and manipulating everything, constantly creating the character's personality. In the process of creation, it is also analyzing and criticizing. When performing a laugh, it is also analyzing and criticizing whether the laugh has reached the required degree. Therefore, performing arts is inherently contradictory, and the actor's self combines the creative subject and object.</p>
<p>The creation of performing arts lies in this unity of contradictory opposition. The congruence of the actor's creative emotions and the actor's own intellectuality are mutually restrictive. Therefore, to sum it up in one sentence, it is still Stanislavski's famous saying: "Use willpower to express inspiration." The creation of the actor's art is to express the character's personality as much as possible, but with half a self lurking inside as the master of creation.</p>
<p>In addition, some actors deliberately use various methods to induce their true feelings. For example, when playing a drunkard, he really drinks a lot of wine, so his performance is "real"! Yes, it is "real," but it is no longer art. It is no longer acting, but simply experiencing real life. Moreover, this method can easily lead to an uncontrollable situation at any time.</p>
<p>In conclusion: The purpose of the actor's art is to express the character's personality as much as possible and to convey the emotions that must be conveyed. But these are not the emotions of daily life. They are non-real emotions selected by the actor from experience or imagination and that can be controlled and manipulated by the actor's own self. It is the sense of reality of creation that can be expressed by willpower. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Performance of "Huanghuagang" in Guangzhou <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shulun</p>
<p>Last year's performance of "Huanghuagang" in Guangzhou was a combination and expression of collective strength, composed of more than three hundred drama workers and twenty-odd large and small troupes.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, I still clearly remember the beginning and completion of the "Huanghuagang" performance work, which only took place in ten days. Precisely because of the shortness and urgency of the time, the play was written in separate acts and required to be submitted within two days. After one day of overall sorting and mimeographing, the distribution of the script began.</p>
<p>Following the resolution of the script issue, the entire performance work unfolded in an even more cumbersome and tense manner. At this time, the Education Association became our temporary workshop. Strips of wood, cloth, paints, and all stage equipment were mixed and piled up. From every clear morning to late at night, batches of drama workers engaged in tireless labor. Some put aside their usual affairs, and some took leave from school. All of them sacrificed their own selves to respond to an urgent call and gathered in the set-making workshop. Among them, the achievements of the children, in particular, can never be erased: they pre-spent their work capacity beyond that of adults, occupying the majority of the work, forgetting their age, forgetting to eat, and desperately working alongside the older generation. It was by relying on their spirit and courage of struggling without regard for anything that strips of wood were pieced together into frames and pieces of cloth were cut into gray sheets. In short, an exciting atmosphere circulated in the Education Association, with the sound of nails entering wood ringing throughout the day and night.</p>
<p>At the same time, a large number of actors gathered in the same venue and rehearsed separately by act. It was so hurried and tense, and diverse tasks were carried out at high speed.</p>
<p>By the first night of the performance (the 28th), a small portion of the audience was already quietly waiting for the show to begin. The people on stage were even more frantically producing the set. It was not until the last pillar was painted and a gray sheet was hung up that "Huanghuagang" was able to be represented figuratively in front of more than four thousand audience members.</p>
<p>Because "Huanghuagang" is a play of the masses, there was a complete arrangement for the venue in advance. When each act reached the peak of its climax, a united and orderly chorus and impassioned speakers would be used as a powerful interlude to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Thus, everyone was acting as a member of the masses, exciting themselves and equally exciting others. Finally, in response to the call of "those with money give money, those with strength give strength" for fundraising, there was inevitably a huge and satisfactory harvest.</p>
<p>Extending all the way to the third night, the strength of all the staff was excessively exhausted, but the courage was even more advanced. Therefore, after extreme fatigue, there was a brave decision: that is, to extend the performance to another last night specifically for the workers.</p>
<p>For this, we endured excessive fatigue and rejoiced. We stopped sleeping in the deep night and divided the responsibility for mimeographing more than four thousand tickets among several troupes. The next morning, we personally distributed them to many workers' groups. Therefore, the last night was the most fatal night for lack of work, and also the most feverish night for excitement.</p>
<p>On this night, our drama comrades issued impassioned words for the workers, and the workers responded with enthusiastic applause, presenting us with bright banners, which represented their enthusiastic support for the war of resistance work!</p>
<p>For this performance, we dare to guarantee that every night more than four thousand audience members were aroused by the heroic struggles of the revolutionary martyrs to produce a surging emotional response. Moreover, they believed that the free soul of the Republic of China would rather die than be humiliated, and they would more firmly strive for the final victory of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Secondly, from this performance, the government has noticed the effect of drama, and for the first time practiced the joint cooperation of both sides. It is precisely because of this that it was able to obtain unprecedented social influence.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in the common work, more than four hundred drama comrades were mobilized, laying the foundation for a unified front in the Guangzhou drama circle.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the later generation of drama workers inherited the legacy of the martyrs and used the spirit of fearless hard work as a commemorative gift, which the drama fighters should eternally maintain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we undeniably accept the criticism and lessons of this work:</p>
<p>Firstly, due to the length of the script and the slowness of the opening and scene changes, the continuous development of the dramatic story and emotions in each act were unnaturally interrupted; secondly, due to the hasty preparation, each department felt that there were imperfect places in the performance.</p>
<p>However, this touching, unfinished masterpiece stands before us, asking us to gather a more powerful force to reproduce it!</p>

<h3 id="e62">"Huanghuagang" Performance Postponed to Next Month <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The grandest national defense mass drama "Huanghuagang," jointly prepared for public performance by more than forty drama groups in Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to be performed on the nights of March 28th and 29th at the Taiping Theatre to commemorate this great memorial day of the Republic of China. Moreover, it has received the cooperation of the Joint Relief Committee for South China Refugees from all walks of life in Hong Kong, which promised to allocate 1,000 yuan for performance expenses in addition to the theatre rental. However, because the time is too rushed, it is feared that ticket sales and all preparations will not be in time, so it was temporarily decided to postpone the performance to around the fifteenth of next month, so that in addition to publicity, more relief work can be done. Now, various drama groups have begun to step up rehearsals daily at the Hainan Vocational School in Kowloon, and are also preparing all scenery and costumes. In order to provide practical assistance, the Relief Committee also specially selected Lu Guomian, Liu Qingbo, Ye Lanquan, Lin Peisheng, Li Jianfeng, Lu Fu and other seventeen people from the committee's standing council to form a "Huanghuagang" Charity Performance Special Committee at its fortieth general meeting yesterday to step up work. With the joint efforts of more than forty drama groups in the Hong Kong drama community, coupled with the call and assistance of almost all major social groups in the Hong Kong Relief Federation, we believe that the performance of "Huanghuagang" will definitely have unprecedentedly great achievements in terms of both publicity and fundraising.</p>
<h3 id="e63">From the Mainland <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Ruoqing</p>
<p>My experiences in the mainland over the past few months have given me many new feelings and summaries; returning to Hong Kong with a burning heart, how happy I am!</p>
<p>Indeed, I feel very fortunate, because in the short period of time since I left Hong Kong, Hong Kong's drama movement has made significant progress; people no longer ignore drama, and as a result, the atmosphere of drama has gradually thickened; performances of dramas with contemporary significance, whether in terms of quality or quantity, have also increased; at the same time, the emergence of drama group organizations and the increase in spoken drama audiences have also progressed together; the efforts of newspapers and magazines to advocate for the emerging drama movement can also be clearly seen from the increasing number of "Drama and Film Supplements"... All of this shows that the drama movement is unfolding rapidly in Hong Kong, which is truly the result of the efforts of drama workers, seniors, and partners in or traveling to Hong Kong, as well as the support of cultural figures who sympathize with the drama movement! I, who lack cultivation in drama, should be very pleased to see this gratifying phenomenon; at the same time, I should be very ashamed that I have not been able to contribute even the slightest bit of weak strength to this work!</p>
<p>This sacred war of resistance has brought so much benefit to our Chinese nation! In the months I returned to the mainland, I saw many amazing innovations and progress in various aspects in Changsha and Guilin. Just in terms of drama work, which I am most familiar with, I have gained many new understandings and indelible impressions: the spirit of hard work and endurance of drama workers, the dynamic of vigorous development, the enthusiastic emotions of all levels towards drama, the close connection between military and political organs and cultural groups for drama work, and the practical and universal nature of the war of resistance drama penetrating into the countryside and approaching the masses, truly make us have to rise up and work even harder for the entire movement by abandoning all selfish opinions! Naturally, the environment in Hong Kong cannot be compared with the mainland, so in the work, there will inevitably be various difficulties. However, in any case, I at least hope that we will complete the following two tasks in the shortest period of time:</p>
<p>First, drama performances on stage should progress in terms of both quality and quantity. We must enable drama to have more contact with the audience, and at the same time, the result of each contact must give the audience a good impression and a deep emotion. Only in this way can the spoken drama movement have a foundation in the local area.</p>
<p>Second, we must make drama as popular as possible and hold more public, free performances in various ways, so that it does not become the exclusive property of the upper middle class and ignore the more important working masses.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that drama comrades in Hong Kong can have the opportunity to communicate with drama workers in the mainland from time to time, and often accept the situation of domestic activities and progress, so that the Hong Kong drama movement can take consistent steps and work in harmony within the possible scope.</p>
<p>I am very lacking in all kinds of cultivation, and my understanding of drama is also very superficial. I dare not judge whether everything I have said above is correct, but I can only say that it is a little hope from my burning heart. In addition to vowing to do my best to the drama movement of our great era, I sincerely ask for the instructions and encouragement of seniors and partners!</p>

<p>Joint Performance by All Hong Kong Children's Drama Troupes</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the April 4th Children's Day and raise funds for refugee children, all Hong Kong children's drama troupes have specially decided to hold a joint public performance of the three-act national defense drama "Long Live Children" on Children's Day (this play is a collective creation of the Ant Children's Drama Troupe, written by Zuo Ji). The participating troupes include: Ant Children's Drama Troupe, Pioneer Children's Drama Troupe, Xuezhenhui Children's Troupe, Qingnian Tongleshe Children's Troupe, Central Girls' School, etc., and are actively working these days. And have obtained Ouyang Yuqian, Cai Chusheng, He Ailing, Wang Xiaoying, Wu Hanzhen, Fang Yuyan, Hu Chunbing, Situ Huimin, Lu Fu; Zhu Baishui and other gentlemen as the conference consultants; Zuo Ji, Xi Feng, and Zhuo Ming as the directors, stepping up rehearsals. The date and location of the performance have been set for the morning of April 4th at the Central Theatre, and Wang Xiaoying, He Ailing, and others have helped with the theatre rental. The purpose of this performance is to provide relief to refugee children, but due to the urgency of time and the difficulty of selling tickets, it has been changed to a free donation within the venue. As for the performance expenses, donations will be solicited from all walks of life separately. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be generous in helping to establish this brand-new children's drama movement!</p>
<p>The Red and White Drama Troupe Will Perform the Famous Play "Dance of Demons"</p>
<p>The Red and White Drama Troupe was organized and established three months ago. They are a group of young drama workers from Dongguan County, who have established a long-term war of resistance drama movement in Dongguan County in the past. Now, under the leadership of the troupe leader Lu Keming, they have moved to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, they intend to inherit their past spirit of hard work. On the one hand, they are experimenting with the professionalization movement of drama, and on the other hand, they are also working hard to hold performances for various charitable organizations. Now, their first work has begun, which is to hold a charity performance for the YWCA's Sanguang Troupe to provide relief to refugees. The play to be performed is Chen Bailu's four-act famous play "Dog," also known as "Dance of Demons." The location is Kong Sheng Tang; the date is the evening of April 8th. For this work, they are now rehearsing day and night.</p>
<p>Their lineup is: troupe leader Lu Keming, troupe members include Hu Ruihua, Li Shulun, Xu Guoyu, Ling Ke, He Mantang, Li Zihao, Li Shibing, Ye Zhongzhi, etc. for males; Zhong Ying, Qian Lang, Liao Lulu, Yin Anna, Yuan Huiying, Yin Qi, Xu Fang, Zhou Manlu, etc. for females.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Grand Tournament of Football Heroes: Li Hua Cup Final Today; China United's Strength Suggests High Hopes for Victory; Held at the Hong Kong Stadium at 4 PM <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper) As Qingming Festival approaches, wind and rain add to the melancholy. We "seek refuge in a secluded paradise" but lament being unable to return home.</p>
<p>With nothing to do, watching a football match is the best option. However, continuous spring rain has dampened the atmosphere. May the heavens not inconvenience the footballers; I truly fear the performance of the Li Hua Cup final match will not be spectacular enough.</p>
<p>This trophy was donated by the now defunct Luo Hua Company. It was first established in 1925. In the past thirteen years, the Western Mercantile team has won the most times.</p>
<p>As the donor passes away, the footballers also experience growth and change. Recalling past events fills us with emotion. Nevertheless, the company has left something behind for posterity, a lasting memorial, so even in demise, they leave behind a "name for generations".</p>
<p>In this year's preliminary round, the Western Mercantile team eliminated the Army United team, entering the championship contention and reigniting their ambition to compete for supremacy. As for the China United team, in the preliminary round, Li Huitang exerted minimal effort, leading a group of young players in a match against the Navy. As expected, they emerged victorious in the battle, securing the right to contend for the championship.</p>
<p>Today's match determines the victor. This is a major event in the football world, and the performance of "two famous teams" is something everyone appreciates. Once they take to the stage, it will surely create a sensation. Let's hope that heaven is kind and shows a "smiling face," so that this good occasion in the football field is not marred by rain.</p>
<p>Ying Tang is not "on the mountain" often this year, but when he is, he carries a strategy from Jinmen, and he will surely sell his skills. I believe that today, he will also "not spare his feet" and win back this "heavenly favor" for China United.</p>

<p>Di Bailu (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Reserves: Bi Liban (Police), Yi Shi Du Lan Zhi (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Li Anna, Xia Xian (Joseph)</p>
<p>In the China United lineup, everyone is a talented individual, and they are also very experienced. Even if they are marching in the rain, it doesn't matter. With experience, they can control the ball and manage effectively, which is a significant advantage. Moreover, their established coordination is even better.</p>
<p>The eleven players in the Western Mercantile team are also experienced and cannot be underestimated. However, compared to China United, they are lacking in many aspects, so based on my prediction, China United has a greater chance of winning.</p>
<p>Wu Liezhi is a new internal defender, and his skills are quite good. However, yesterday during the Kowloon Club's match against South China South, he was hit by Deng Guangsen's "ballistic," injuring his foot. Today, he may not be on the front lines.</p>
<p>If they are playing in the rain, they will inevitably have to dribble more. The field is wet, and the ball is heavy, so quick passing will not be easy. Today, China United's front line should mostly use flanking attacks between the internal and external wings, and not constantly take the central breakthrough approach. Because running is tiring in rainy conditions, the usual tactics may not be as effective. To achieve victory, remember to act according to the situation.</p>
<p>Jia Da is very cunning in internal rushes, often striking and causing the opposing forward to be offside. Gu Yitang should be wary of the traps set by Bai Jia when he advances.</p>
<p>Gao Shannu and Zuo Zhi are formidable figures. The China United defenders must find a way to pin them down, preventing them from colluding and invading our territory. If we can restrain them, there will be fewer problems later.</p>
<p>After the match, we invite the wife of the Colonial Secretary Smith (President of the Football Association) to present the award. Let's see if this "treasure" falls into the hands of China United or is obtained by the Western Mercantile team. (Football Field Tycoon)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's Division A football league match between Eastern Club and Middlesex, originally scheduled for 4:30 PM at So Kon Po, was postponed to the 29th (next Wednesday) at 5 PM due to continuous rain and slippery mud. If the match had proceeded, there would not have been many spectators, and the game would not have been exciting. Therefore, the American military team specifically requested Eastern's agreement to postpone the match.</p>
<p>(Rain Caller)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Kowloon Club's Home Unbeaten Record Finally Broken by South China South; South China South Often Has the Advantage in the Rain; Victory with a 3-0 Score, Raising High Hopes for the Championship <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at 3:30 PM, I boarded the Tai Sing ferry and met "Wang Heng" and Luo Nanke (veteran volleyball players from South China University). After some chatting and laughter, we soon arrived on the other side. In the No. 3 "bus," I also met "Football Affairs Officer" Zhou Runnian, leading a "small team" to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the battlefield, I saw the players from the Division B teams South China and Guanghua competing in the wind and rain, covered in mud as if they were "soy sauce ducks." I also saw a large gathering with "shelter" on the side facing the sea. This was a scene of playing in the rain.</p>
<p>The Division B match ended with South China South narrowly winning 2-1. Having passed this hurdle, they have reached the final stage. Let's see if the warriors of the coming week can emerge victorious. If they win two more points at that time, the Division B championship, which they haven't obtained for a long time, will be South China's prize.</p>
<p>As the Division B soldiers withdrew, the Division A soldiers entered the field. South China South's lineup was missing a central commander. Domestic fans, upon seeing this, asked each other, "Where did Feng Ershu go?" He is not ill. Someone saw him playing billiards at the South China billiards room on the eighth floor of the Chinese Mercantile Bank in the afternoon, full of energy. Why did he suddenly withdraw before the battle? There must be something strange going on.</p>
<p>Since Ershu was tired and reluctant, Li Enliang was forced to fill the gap. Domestic fans, seeing this situation, were worried, thinking that South China South was not giving it their all in such an important battle. How could they win? Moreover, the Kowloon Club, the "local snake," is not easy to defeat. General passenger cars consider that stadium a dangerous place. Could South China South win without exerting full strength?</p>
<p>However, there is no need for you to worry; South China South has its own methods. Look, they scored a goal in less than a minute after the start of the match. So fast, it was unexpected, and it shows the strength of South China South. Three minutes later, they broke through another barrier, solidifying their victory. Their championship demeanor is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>As a result of the decisive battle, South China South won by three goals. From this, it can be seen that South China South was constantly gaining momentum and controlling the entire field, ultimately breaking Kowloon's home unbeaten record. This masterpiece is a reward obtained through excellent skills.</p>
<p>Yesterday I said that if it rained, it would be very advantageous for South China South. This is because Kowloon relies on the advantage of being on their home turf, but if it rains, the field and ball will be wet, and their usual steps will be disrupted. Naturally, there will be no advantage on their home turf. The Kowloon players' strategies are not as effective as South China South's athletic training. Therefore, I dared to predict that South China South was very likely to win. And indeed, what I said came true.</p>
<p>He Li's absence due to injury was Kowloon's fatal wound. If he had played, he might have reduced the number of goals conceded. However, although Kowloon had the advantage of being on their home turf yesterday, they were unable to use it, and their defeat was deserved. Even if He Li had been there to guard the goal, he would not have been able to save it.</p>
<p>Our side's goalkeeper position was again held by Bao Jiaping, protecting "South China." But in "peaceful times, his talents are difficult to display," because there were not many dangerous situations in front of the goal, he was quite relaxed. However, he did deflect a corner kick in the first half, showing his wonderful skills.</p>
<p>Among the frontline players, Li Zhaorong and Deng Guangsen were the most swift and decisive. Zhaorong is good at dribbling and maneuvering, and Guangsen is fast and energetic, excelling in variations. As for Zuo Weidou, he was slow and missed opportunities, with nothing good to say. Li Enliang, leading for the first time, was not yet capable, but he was able to work hard and strive for the future to become a great player.</p>
<p>The defenders were all competent, and their defense was solid, giving the opposing forwards a feeling of the difficulty of the Shu Road.</p>
<p>Although Kowloon lost, there is one thing that makes me feel that these local snakes are still formidable. Even though Wu Liezhi was injured in the first half and reassigned to the left wing in the second half, with Pei Er retreating to defend inside, weakening the defense, they were still able to defend to the death and avoid conceding more goals, showing their strength and tenacity.</p>
<p>…Football Field Tycoon…</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>[Half a Minute] After the referee blew the whistle to start the match, South China South launched an offensive, advancing on all five fronts. Bei Lishi panicked and lost the ball. Zhaorong stepped forward and lightly swept the ball into the goal in front of the goal [1-0].</p>
<p>[Three Minutes] Zhaorong engaged in close combat, familiar with the road, circling left and right, and executing a brilliant shot. Jie Fuli pushed it away in time, only conceding a corner kick. Douwen crossed it, and Yingqi headed it in, scoring another goal [2-0].</p>
<p>(Fourteen Minutes) Kowloon counterattacked. Tiansheng and Shaohan quickly set up defense. Yishiwuwen crossed from the sideline. Maxweilu jumped and headed but missed. Then, Xiaonuos fired from the right, and Jiaping quickly pushed it away, the ball landing in the wilderness, barely avoiding danger. This was the most dangerous moment for South China South in the entire match. However, although Kowloon had the advantage of a corner kick, the result was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>(Twenty Minutes) Douwen was assisted by Zhaorong and Enliang twice, infiltrating Kowloon's territory, but ultimately the shot was inaccurate and went into the air.</p>
<p>(Twenty-Eight Minutes) Bei Lishi attacked on the forward line, infringing on Rongzhao, and was penalized with a free kick. Rongzhao took the kick and passed it to Guangsen. Guangsen shot with all his might. Wu Liezhi raised his foot to block, and with a bang, he fell to the ground, injured his ankle, and left the field. Guoyachen was reassigned to the wing, and Yishiwuwen returned to defend.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>The battle reopened. Wu Liezhi, limping, was reassigned to the left wing, Zeng Eryuan to the left inside, and Yishiwuwen retreated to the right forward. The original lineup was greatly changed.</p>
<p>With South China South often gaining momentum, Zhaorong and Enliang advanced together. Approaching the enemy's goal, Zhaorong fired, quickly and powerfully, but unfortunately missed.</p>
<p>(Twenty-Nine Minutes) Guangsen single-handedly attacked the camp. Pei Er was unable to intercept and was cut through by Guangsen. Enliang and Douwen flew in together. Douwen shot the ball into the net from the corner of the goal, making it [3-0].</p>
<p>(Thirty-Three Minutes) Tiansheng and Guowei switched positions, feigning attacks, aiming to confuse Kowloon. Kowloon was also unable to catch up, and their attack slightly slackened, allowing South China South to attack again. However, they gained nothing more, and ultimately won 3-0.</p>

<p>In the open men's basketball tournament, the first match last night was between Division B teams Li Xing and Chunfeng. The former was last year's Meidu Ding champion and a top team in Division B. However, the team's performance was abnormal last night, leading by only 22-18 in the first half. They gradually returned to normal in the second half, and ultimately defeated Chunfeng 40-20. The second match was between Division A teams Police and South China. One was composed of Chinese and Indian police officers, and the other was last year's inter-school champion. The former's players were all tall and strong, winning with strength, while the latter was known for their agility and skill. As a result of the match, South China won 36-24. South China's ability to win was based on the team's close coordination, excellent positioning, and short-range passing. Therefore, although the opponent was strong and powerful, their strength was ineffective. Moreover, during encirclement attacks, they feinted attacks and shot at the basket with lightning speed, catching the opponent off guard. Although Huang Zuode did not perform exceptionally well last night, the overall performance did not diminish. Zhong Jian and Chen Zanfu's interceptions and passes were skillful. The rest of Liu Senrong, Li Junsheng, and others also fulfilled their duties through teamwork. The police, on the other hand, lacked flexible cooperation and accurate shooting, which was their fatal flaw.</p>
<p>Throughout the match, South China always had the upper hand. Zhong Ling first scored a free throw, opening the scoring. Chen Zanfu and Lan Maoqia also scored baskets one after another, initially creating a score of 11-2. As Chen Jinkui and Zeng Tingkai displayed their skills, they caught up, but still trailed South China 8-14. Afterwards, the game gradually became tense, with each side scoring. At the end of the first half, South China led 15-10. In the second half, Liu Senrong, Zhong Ling, Chen Zanyin, and others from South China were unstoppable, scoring six consecutive goals. The score became 24-10. Then, the police tried their best to counterattack, with Chen Jinkui and Babao Singh making significant contributions. However, they lost to South China 21-32. After playing for a while, South China finally defeated the police 36-24.</p>
<p>In the final match, International faced Chunhe. International was strong and powerful, with accurate shooting. Although Chunhe tried their best to resist, they trailed 16-24 at the end of the first half. In the second half, International's momentum increased, and Chunhe gradually found it difficult to cope. As a result, International won 54-28.</p>

<p>Andrew Manson is a newly graduated doctor, working as a doctor's assistant in a small town. The work is heavy and the pay is low. Moreover, the doctor's wife is stingy and harsh. Manson often feels hungry. Fortunately, he meets an obscure doctor, Denny, a practitioner who is willing to study hard. The two hit it off and immediately become friends. They discover that many villagers suffer from fever due to unsanitary canals, but the authorities do nothing to repair them. Helpless, they resort to a desperate measure: blowing up the canals with dynamite at night. The authorities are forced to rebuild them, and the fever is indeed reduced and eliminated.</p>
<p>Manson saves the life of a newborn infant and receives a small monetary reward. When the doctor's wife finds out, she becomes furiously angry, accusing him of embezzling public funds. He can no longer tolerate it and decides to leave, finding another job in a mining area. However, that job requires a doctor with a family. He already has someone in mind, but has not yet expressed his feelings, let alone married. In order not to miss this opportunity, he falsely claims that he is about to marry his fiancée and temporarily gets the position, promising to take his family to work in a few days.</p>
<p>The woman he loves is Christine Barlow, a schoolteacher in the town where he worked as an assistant. He feels it is time to propose marriage. As a result, he gets both a wife and a job, happily setting up a practice in the mining area. Denny gives him a microscope.</p>
<p>He discovers that many workers suffer from coughs due to excessive dust in the air. After studying many people's sputum, he writes a report and submits it to medical journals, which is praised by medical authorities. At the same time, he is loyal to his duties, going down into the mines to rescue people, and is also supported by the local workers. However, he is too loyal to his duties and incurs the dissatisfaction of Chinkin, a magnate among the workers, for refusing to sign sick leave certificates. One day, Chinkin, falsely accusing Manson of animal abuse, rushes into his laboratory, destroys his months of hard work, and passes a resolution prohibiting him from raising guinea pigs for experiments. Manson argues forcefully, explaining that his experiments are for their benefit, but ultimately fails. Unable to continue his experiments, he leaves the mining area and goes to London to open a practice.</p>
<p>Business is bad in the city, and he is heavily in debt. Eventually, the microscope is also taken away by the creditor. Just then, he is suddenly called to a wealthy family to treat a woman. He then meets her. She is a wealthy socialite. After she recovers, she invites Manson to go out. At this time, Manson gradually abandons his sacred profession and spends his days with her and some pleasure-seeking noble doctors, living a wealthy life. Marrow is dissatisfied with his absurdity, but cannot dissuade him.</p>
<p>Denny, full of hope, comes to London to work with him to do something to help sick children, but is met with a cold shoulder. Filled with anger, he drowns his sorrows in alcohol. One day, after getting drunk, he rants and raves. On the street, he is hit by a car and injured. It would not have been fatal, but it is a pleasure-seeking doctor negligent of his duties who sends him to his death. Manson loses his good friend and wanders the streets, witnessing the suffering of poor children. The words of his deceased friend still echo in his ears, and he suddenly realizes.</p>
<p>For taking a sick child he recognizes out of a poorly managed and negligent hospital and giving it to a lung specialist for treatment, he causes a great backlash from the medical association, because that lung specialist is not a member of the medical association. Although the girl is cured, he cannot escape the slander of being a quack. Manson speaks passionately, denouncing the negligence of the doctors. After he finishes speaking, he and Marrow leave hand in hand, continuing the unfinished work of their deceased friend.</p>
<p>The story is adapted from the famous novel by A. J. Cronin. Directed by King Vidor, starring Robert Donat and Rosalind Russell, it was the top of the ten best English-language films of 1938.</p>
<p>The whole play focuses on Robert Donat's Dr. Manson, and Robert plays the role with ease. His British accent, every word heavy and powerful, is easy to be moved by after listening to a few of his speeches, used to the light and fluent American tone. The performance of a young doctor who has just left school with lofty ambitions to serve the people, is tempted by the environment, tends to pleasure, and finally strives to extricate himself, is extremely profound and moving.</p>
<p>Rosalind has fewer scenes, but plays her role well. Ralph Richardson, who plays Denny, has even fewer scenes, but he is very good.</p>
<p>The dialogue is plentiful without being dull, and it can grab the audience's heart. The direction is handled properly, such as the section where Manson proposes to Marrow, which is light and interesting. The final ending is abrupt, but concise and powerful, leaving people wanting more.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Analysis of Fan Mail <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Mostly Slick —</p>
<p>In foreign film circles, every slightly famous male and female star often receives many fan letters. Each star receives dozens or hundreds of letters every day, and even needs to hire a secretary to handle the work of receiving and sending letters.</p>
<p>However, the motives of these fans for writing to the stars are often pure, but there are also many slick characters. In fact, they are not as infatuated with their stars as we imagine.</p>
<p>Denham Studios in England was founded by famous producer Alexander Korda. The studio once conducted a study and statistic of fan mail and found the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) Only 20% of fan letters are sincere and earnest.</p>
<p>(2) 10% of the letters are requests for the stars' autographs and photos.</p>
<p>(3) There is a group of people who like to come up with their own ideas. They write to the stars giving various criticisms and advice, recommending what kind of stories, roles, and costumes, etc., are suitable for their personality. This type of letter accounts for about 10%.</p>
<p>(4) Begging the stars for financial assistance accounts for more than 15%. This is also because general moviegoers believe that movie stars are rich, which leads to this idea. Another 10% of the letters ask the stars to answer questions about love or to solve difficulties in their careers. Because they admire them too much, they simply regard the stars as encyclopedias.</p>
<p>(5) 10% of the letters are from certain friendly groups or organizations, asking the production company to allow them to use a certain star's name for publicity.</p>
<p>(6) There is also a type of speculator who writes to the stars asking them to invest in their new businesses (most of these are difficult to recover). This type accounts for the largest number of letters, as many as 30%.</p>
<p>When Merle Oberon was affiliated with the company, many speculators repeatedly wrote to her (at that time, she was the most popular British actress), preparing many investment opportunities for her, saying that a newly invented powder could sell well in the market. In addition, they also wrote to other stars, saying the same thing, wanting to unconditionally give them the opportunity to get rich.</p>
<p>However, it is no wonder that so many fans are speculating. In fact, many businesses are founded by movie stars, such as many dance halls, clothing stores, mobile libraries, document agencies, and actor agencies, etc. In fact, they are very attractive, which aroused the interest of fans, and everyone is busy writing letters to turn the stars' minds.</p>

<h3 id="e78">From Connection to Work Development <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>The bugle of the united front has long been sounded, and the manifestation of unified action has already existed. Now we have this action. This means that we should go one step further and actively promote practical work. We do not need to deny that we are in a special environment and our activities are subject to special restrictions. As far as our scope of activities is concerned, we should not hide ourselves and make detours to achieve our goals, but we cannot be like Gautier, a major character in the beginning of French romanticism, wearing a "red half-arm" to attract attention and appear in this deformed alien land with a very thin atmosphere. What we require is practical work, not attention-seeking; close cooperation, not fighting alone. Of course, after the War of Resistance, this tendency has greatly changed, but this tail of the past sometimes reveals itself from the gray coat. We should now eliminate this shortcoming of the past. Anything that is harmful to our current goals, we should first conduct a self-examination and eradicate it completely.</p>
<p>In this remote rear, we do not hear the sound of artillery, and we do not smell the smoke of gunpowder, but there are also many important tasks waiting for us to do. We have our territory, our weapons, and our advancing group. If we do not exert our strength, it is a waste of our human and material resources. At the same time, if literature and art, one of the important departments of a vital and emerging culture, does not take an offensive strategy, it will inevitably retreat and tend to decline. This is a public principle that cannot be violated by all things in the natural world and the social world. One of our main tasks at present is how to seize those backward readers and lift their heads from the anesthesia of those black reading materials to see another world. This requires a lot of hard work. We should study those various yellow news, entertaining reading materials, and all other low-level and sensual reading materials. What is the power of their appeal? How can we break these anesthetic forces? How can we replace them with reading materials that can replace them, so that the readers' inclination gradually changes and gradually tends to be advanced, so as not to be anesthetized by those licentious reading materials and eventually sink irretrievably. This is a work that requires patience and effort, and it cannot be accomplished by shouting slogans alone. At the same time, our so-called new cultural people often have a tendency to look down on everything and despise those so-called erotic writers and the readers behind them. This is a big mistake. We must know that our readers are limited to a few intellectuals, students, and progressive shop assistants, etc. In terms of quantity, they are not very large, far less than the broad masses owned by an author of erotic novels whom we despise. Even if you treat these people with a contemptuous attitude every day, or criticize them with strict words and righteous arguments (of course, we must admit that this theoretical criticism is necessary) and it is justified, they have no words to refute. But our theorists, I must tell you, this article of yours is still written for ourselves to read, because those who read your great work, in addition to us "extras" who have to take a look, the rest are intellectuals, students, and progressive small shop assistants within our circle. Those who write erotic novels do not know about this, and those backward readers who welcome such works simply do not want to read your long articles. This is not to say that we should not write such theories, but that we should talk about how to transform those readers. At the very least, we should not forget those authors and ignore them completely. We write our articles, they write their articles, "the river water does not interfere with the well water," you do your work, we do our work, bow to each other and retreat, each goes his own way, or glare at each other, the walls are heavily guarded. Neither the former laissez-faire attitude nor the latter hostile attitude is a positive solution. We should try to contact them. Even if we cannot "incorporate" them into our camp, we can at least instill some new blood into them, so that they can passively reduce as much as possible those very toxic components in their works and increase the anti-enemy components as much as possible. We can see from the various supplements in Hong Kong that those writers have changed their styles to some extent after the War of Resistance. The turbulence of the great era has made it impossible to stabilize their positions. They also write about the War of Resistance, although not purely, but the facts of the War of Resistance are also used as interspersed materials in the shell of the story. This proves that they are not impossible to promote. The problem is how we can make further efforts.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I must add a brief explanation. The old authors I mentioned above are of pure conduct. As for those Japanese heretics, traitorous literary theorists, and eulogists of "Wang's" who took the old ticket, we should take a decisive attitude and give them a merciless attack, so that their toxins cannot spread like poison gas and harm the people. We feel that we have talked very little about such an important and realistic issue, that is, the attack on absurd theories, and that escaping from reality is tantamount to abandoning our responsibility. Come on, let us take back those eyes that are looking at the distant stars and focus on the current real problems, not letting it slip away in the slightest. When there is an opportunity, we will jointly make a strong statement and give those theories a merciless encirclement and suppression.</p>
<p>What is said above is mostly in the negative aspects. Now I want to put forward a few tasks with positive significance. It would be great if cultural people could go to the front line and give practical help to the War of Resistance itself. If this is not possible, it is also valuable to contribute to literary and artistic creation within the scope of one's personal position in the rear. Chinese literary and artistic circles should be lacking in theoretical translation, and creation. Both those who carry guns and those who carry pens have their important significance in the battle. We should not underestimate ourselves. What we see in our current publications or what we write under our pens are, generally speaking, lighter works in terms of weight, and a large part of our time, I dare not say, has not been wasted. We naturally do not hope that such meaningless waste will continue for a long time. We hope that everyone in this relatively stable rear can bury their heads and write or translate more systematic or larger and valuable works. As far as the current situation is concerned, publication is of course more difficult. Some cultural institutions simply do not print books, or they are speculative books or lighter books in terms of weight. Hiding it in famous mountains is also a way to comfort ourselves. Speaking of this, I think of the method of the literary and artistic workers' cooperative, where writers gather together to print and sell their own works. Such organizations have already appeared abroad. In China, the Fu Society in Shanghai also had good results last year. The focus of this method is not on making profits, but on developing culture. This meaning is different from other bookstores that are solely for business purposes, and the organization is also different. It is something that we should and should do. If we have a precise plan, appropriate distribution, and good guidance from domestic old writers, coupled with the regular criticism and introduction of publications and magazines under the same goal, I think we can definitely make some contributions to culture.</p>
<p>Here, due to the limitations of the social environment, the writing level is not as high as we hope. Most of the enthusiastic and upward-looking writers have not yet achieved special achievements due to the limitations of their age or their limited cultivation, but it is not that there is no future. Naturally, I hope that those old writers who are responsible for guidance will give them as much guidance and encouragement as possible. At the same time, I also hope that they will learn more from famous domestic writers and excellent foreign writers. The more effort they put in, the more they will gain. Do not be complacent because of some achievements, nor be disappointed because of a failure. Everyone should be courageous and have extremely strong self-confidence, even a little bit of self-conceit. It was probably the German writer Kleist who often wanted to take the crown from Goethe's head. Every young writer should have such ambition. This is not to say that having such ambition is enough, but that after having such ambition, they should strive to achieve it. It is not difficult to achieve success and become famous in the literary world. After Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front was published, he became famous overnight. At that time, he was still living in Switzerland and did not know that he had become a celebrity. Literary and artistic workers, let's work hard together. The arrival of this new momentum is the beginning of new work, that is, the first sound of our efforts inspired by this driving force.</p>
<p>Attack——Written by Hong Feng</p>
<h3 id="e79">Snow in Manchuria <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You want to find a pistol?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry"! She thought again: "Dangerous people are always afraid of danger"! Therefore, "pistol" gave her a new enlightenment--. She secretly looked for a sharp knife used for picnics, hid it in her coat, and brought several handkerchiefs and a piano rack in front of him, which he stared at with electricity. At the same time, she held the handle of the sharp knife with one hand, and wanted to pierce his throat. While she was fumbling for his collar with the other hand, he said to her:</p>
<p>"What? Are you plotting something"?</p>
<p>This sound, like steel rubbing against each other, made her hand, which was fumbling for his collar, fall down numbly and tremblingly; because she was the weaker, the reason of the weaker could not control the risky action. However, her thoughts were sensitive, and she knew that the hand that had touched happiness and failed in the past would inevitably bring misfortune, and needed to be arranged in a place where this misfortune could be eliminated, so as to avoid suffering more hardships. Therefore, she moved that hand to his chest and fiddled with his scarf! She deliberately said aggrievedly:</p>
<p>"Who knows you would be afraid of me"!</p>
<p>"What do you want to do with your hand"!</p>
<p>He immediately opened her hand and let his own hand resist her approach. She was even smarter and automatically backed away a little:</p>
<p>"I just wanted to look at your scarf..."</p>
<p>He believed it, and felt uneasy and ashamed after misunderstanding others; he asked her in a tone of forgiveness:</p>
<p>"Do you want my scarf? Don't you have one?"</p>
<p>She used this topic to continue the conversation, and she said:</p>
<p>"I have one, but I can't find it"!</p>
<p>He took off his own scarf and put it around her, which was sympathy, but it was a waste. What she gave was nothing more than a deeper antipathy and hatred, or a kind of residue after cheating. Although she kept saying:</p>
<p>"Thank you"! (Eighteen)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Future of Hong Kong's Literary and Artistic Movement <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Du Ai</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the number of literary and artistic workers who have gathered in Hong Kong from all sides cannot be counted. The literary and artistic supplements in newspapers have increased compared to before, and the scope of art is expanding. However, what can be called a "movement" has not yet been organized. Some time ago, many comrades in the literary and artistic circles seriously noticed this phenomenon and unanimously believed that it was necessary to quickly establish a connection to replace the scattered state of "fighting alone".</p>
<p>This proposition fully reflects the urgency of objective requirements at present. Although Hong Kong is a special region, because this place is closely connected to South China, its status as a major international passage for our country still occupies a considerable position even today after Guangzhou and Wuhan have fallen. In terms of cultural rations, it is also in a position to supply the Dongjiang and Southwest areas of Guangdong, although the extent of this supply is still very insufficient. In recent months, the guerrilla warfare in the Dongjiang area has accelerated, and a large number of young people have run into the occupied areas from Hong Kong. The development of this situation has made the supplements here increasingly find works by new literary and artistic soldiers from the Dongjiang area. On the other hand, because of the close transportation relationship, people in the mainland also hope to obtain cultural rations from here as much as possible. The above situation makes the workers in our literary and artistic circles understand that: Establishing a regular connection, where everyone can often meet and exchange opinions on writing, is not only necessary for the literary and artistic movement in Hong Kong itself; it will definitely have a good effect on the mainland as well.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, some people have recently been working to establish the Hong Kong Branch of the National Interim Writers Association. This is a matter of infinite joy. After the establishment of the branch of the Writers Association, it will be a powerful axis of the Hong Kong literary and artistic movement, which is what everyone expects!</p>
<p>The issue of the united front in literary and artistic circles has been hotly discussed for many years. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, friends in Hong Kong who are engaged in literary and artistic work have turned their pens to the War of Resistance, but the organization of the united front has not yet been built. There is no doubt that the establishment of this branch of the Writers Association will complete this work. We hope that writers of various factions will converge in this branch, establish close ties with each other, and work closely together for a common industry and move forward hand in hand.</p>
<p>The development of the war is urgently demanding a large number of working cadres in various departments of the struggle. Therefore, regularly holding literary and artistic gatherings and training a large number of literary and artistic working cadres is also one of the important tasks at present. In addition, establishing a wide communication network, setting up a guidance department, establishing new relationships with writers in the mainland, publishing organ publications, regularly reporting on the situation of literary and artistic movements in various parts of the country, so that workers in various places are connected on one line, these are all tasks that should be started immediately.</p>
<p>Although the crazy attack of × people has destroyed the center of literature and art, new literary and artistic positions are being built everywhere. The establishment of the branch of the Writers Association will not only bring the Hong Kong literary and artistic movement to a new stage, but will also play a powerful role in defending South China.</p>
