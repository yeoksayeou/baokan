<h3>日×的新困難與新策略</h3>
<p>日本××主義的政策是滅亡中國獨覇東亞，這是日×的根本政策，這是不能變更也永遠不會變更的，直到日本××主義的總崩潰爲止。然而爲了適應每一特殊時期或特殊環境的需要，他們是可以採取一種特殊的策略卽特殊的辦法特殊的花樣的，我們所說日×的新策略，便是指日×爲解救其當前新困難所定出來的新辦法新花樣而言，這種新策略的最後目的，自然也是爲着滅亡中國獨霸東亞。</p>
<p>日×在目前遇到些什麽新的困難呢？我們大家都知道，在半牟以前，日×原想以佔領廣州武漢而屈服我們，戰勝我們的，然而結果不僅我們沒有屈服認輸，相反的，囂日×當局也不得不承認戰爭巳入新的階段，他們不得不承認佔領廣州武漢以後，才是中日戰爭的開始，他們更不得不發出準備與中國作百年戰爭的哀鳴！他們完全喪失了戰爭開始時期『三個月征服中國』的勇氣了！經過半年以來的戰鬥，日×唯一的收獲是佔頃一個南昌城，而他們損失的，則單兵員傷亡而言，就巳由六七十萬增加到八九十萬了！現在中國人，國際人士，和日本人自己都巳明白看到，中國巳經奠定長期抗戰最後勝利的基礎，日×速戰速决的企圖巳經粉碎，中國的危機旗困難一天一天減少，而日×的危機與困難則一天一天的增加。目前日×的困難，在軍事上是兵力的不足，交通的險阻，地形的不利，用兵的困難，後方的空虛；在經濟上是財政的貧困與生產的低降，對外貿易的衰落和國民經濟的崩漬；在政治上是國內反戰情緒的高漲，出口貿易的輕工業旗軍事性質的重工業的矛盾，軍閥財閥與中小資產者及廣大平民的矛盾，統治階級各種政策的矛盾衝突，（如最近關於參加德意軍事同盟的矛盾衝突）。這一切都在日益暴露日本××在牠野蠻的退步的戰爭當中所有困難的發展，日趨於不可克服之境。</p>
<p>日×當然不會不想辦法來克服這種日益嚴重的困難的，日×當然也知道只靠日本本國及其殖民地台灣朝鮮的力量是沒有可能克服這種日益嚴重的困難的，因此，牠們克服困難的中心，不放在牠們本國，而是放在我們中國被佔領的領士上面，被牠統治的人民中間的。即是牠們明知拿牠們的土地，人力，生產，等來和我們比，是不能克服日益進步的困難的，因此牠們就企圖拿中國的土地，人口，生產，加到牠們一方面去，以便解救牠們日益嚴重的危機和困難。這是日×解决新困難的新策喀的基本原則。</p>
<p>爲要實施這種新策略，表現在具體事實上面的，主要的特點就是牠要從主要的是軍事改變到主要的是政治的進攻。這不是說牠要停止了軍事的進攻，也更不是餽牠要放棄了軍事的進攻，而是主要的拿政治進攻作主，軍事的進攻來配合。卽是企圖依靠政治的力量，配合軍事的行動，來統治佔領區域的中國，侵略沒有被牠佔領的中國，達到牠併吞全中國獨霸東亞的目的。所有日×漢奸一切最近的言論與行動，如建立東亞新秩序，加建立中日滿的協同政體，如擴大「反共」「反蔣」「談判和平」的宣傳，如擴大佔頭地區的反奠運動；如加緊刼奪上海漢口天津各租界和在鼓浪嶼強行登陸，如在香港附近海面侵襲英法郵船，如在鄂北豫南發動所謂大包圍殲滅戰和大舉轟炸重慶與寧波福州汕頭，如加倍資助及策動汪精衛進行『反共』『和平』的宣傳旗組織僞中央機關等等，所有這一切，其中心目標只有一個，就是想把中國東部，華北，華中，華南，卽把整個黃河以東，平漢，粤漢兩路以東這個地區，也卽是要把中國人口最多土地最肥物產最豐的東部廣大地區，完全拿政治的方法，配合軍事的行動，吞併到日×統治底下，來加緊刼奪與壓榨，解救其目前的危機與困難，進一步實現征服全中國和獨霸東亞！</p>
<p>我們今日不能不特別警備日×這種吸收中國的人力，物力，財力，拿中國的人力，物力，財力來打中國征服中國的陰謀！我們今日更不能不特別警備，汪精衛等近在拚命倡導的反對國共合作，誣衊中央政府，污辱×後戰鬥，及一切挑撥離間我內部團結，打破我持久抗戰决心的言論行動，和用一切方法來破壞我精神動員物質動員與政治軍事經濟外交進步的言論行動，這一切都將協助日×解抉其新困難實現其新策略，而增加我們抗戰建國事業的困難，增加東亞以至全世界民主與和平的威脅！</p>
<p>從這裏巳經可以明瞭，我們今日發展被佔地區×人後方一切戰鬥的重要，我們今日加緊打擊反共和平言論，和打擊一切漢奸傀儡與汪等主動的僞中央黨政機關的重要，我們更應明瞭今日加緊全國團結，加緊人民動員和加緊推動政治進步的重要了！</p>
<h3>戰時中國青年的新地位</h3>
<p>— 馮文彬講　西安特約航信</p>
<p>在這十九個月的中間，不論在國祭國內的形勢都有了巨大的歷史變化。在十九個月以前。我們剛剛進入國內和平的局面，抗戰在有些人中間還是一個爭論的題目，有些人還懷疑着中國究竟能不能抗戰，能不能進行全面的和持久的抗戰。但是現在抗戰已經進行了一年多，我們全體靑年在蔣委員長的號召和領導之下，都巳經處於戰爭的狀態裏了。</p>
<p>中國在這十九個月中間所起的變化，的確是超過以往歷史的幾十年，幾百年，甚至幾千年。佔全人類四分之一的中華民族的偉大的民族自衛戰爭，這在中國完全是破天荒的。內部發生過嚴重分裂的中華民族，現在是第一次的不分黨派階層種族的團結起來了，長期受帝國中義壓迫的中華民族，巳經第一次抬起頭來，挺起胸來了！一切的變化，如，政權和軍隊的統一和進步，民主政治日趨發展，民衆運動日趨活躍，這些都是我們所親眼看見和親身經歷的，他們使我們民挨的氣象煥然一新。中華民族的一切都在進步，都在改變，都在自新自强。一切腐敗的。反動的，違背抗戰的勢力，一切黃濬，王公度，張慕陶乃至李服膺韓復渠（以至汪精衛）之流，隨着戰爭的發展，一天一天在消除；三民主義新中國的幼芽，一天一天的生長起來了。</p>
<p>但是，一切變化中間最有决定意義的，自無還是抗戰。抗戰不但是我們各種進步的原動力，而且是我們生死存亡所擊的唯一大事。</p>
<p>抗戰决定我們民族的命運，也决定着我們全體靑年的命運，現在中國靑年運動的形勢和十九個月以前完全不同，全中國的靑年今天正處在非常的時期，歷史上空前未有的時期。</p>
<p>今天中國靑年無論何人，無論否何時何地，　的生活沒有不受着戰爭的影饗和支配的。戰爭從根本改變了我們的生活狀况，因比戰爭成了今天中國靑年運動的中心問題。日本帝國主義的侵略，首先帶給我們空前的災建。</p>
<p>我們許許多多繁華的城市，已經陷落了，大部分的工廠關閉了，成千成萬的勞動靑年和職業靑年，不得不餓若肚皮四處流浪了。著名的學校如南開，同濟，曁南，交通，復旦，大夏，光華，中央，華中，湖大，廈大，中山，嶺南，都遭受到猛烈的轟炸，學校不斷的緊縮合併遷移，至少五分之四的學生都不能繼續求學了。</p>
<p>農村的土地，有些完全被×人或×人所指揮的朝鮮人台灣人强佔了，有些被×人禁止耕種，就是種了莊稼也被强迫的　掉，或是到了收穫的時期而不能收穫。×人經過的地方，房屋，牲口，農具全部都毀了，再逃囘來，生活也難于維持了。</p>
<p>我們無數千萬的同胞，爲什麽失學失業，過着飢寒交迫的生活呢？爲什麽流離道路，無家可歸呢？爲什麽不見了爸爸媷媽兄弟姊妹呢？這就是日本帝國主義侵略的結果。什麼人奪去了我們幸福，什麽人奪去了我們的土地，田園，房屋財產，打破了我們原來的希望呢？這就是日本法西期××軍閥。</p>
<p>我們想起日本軍閥對於我們怎樣直接的屠殺摧殘，更不能不熱血沸騰。我們不知有多少萬年老的父母和英俊的靑年遇了害！南京的同胞被屠殺八萬人，被姦岸兩萬人。廣東一省在廿七年六月七日以前受轟炸一千四百餘次，來的×機數目先後共達五千九百八十七架，投彈一萬二千七百六十九枚，遇難同胞四千五百九十五人，受傷的八千五百五十五人。這一筆血債我們怎麽能够忘記！</p>
<p>我們不能忘記東北和華北許多靑年被迫替×人拿槍來殺自己的同胞，去年三月晉北一千多靑年農民被×人由朔縣押到大同，×人爲防他們反正，竟把他們</p>
<p>一個一個都打了啞針。多少天使樣可愛的兒童被捉去做奴隸，替×人輸血至死，去年春天山東濮縣的三百多婦女兒童在天主敎堂避難，×××××××××××××，最後×人退出時竟子敎堂放火一燒，避難的婦女兒童都燒死在裏面。差不多同一個時期。×人估領了山西的寧武和陽　，把兩城五百多兒童。</p>
<p>我們不能忘記我們現愛的靑年領袖曹承憲陳柱天孫世實怎樣被×人炸死，我們更不能忘記勇敢的史偉，他在山東館陶領導農民游擊戰爭，被×人捉住了綁在飛跑的馬上活活的拖死。</p>
<p>在這裏我們要代表全國的靑年吿訴全世界，我們黃帝千孫永遠也不能忘記替我們的犧牲者復仇；我們和日本帝國主義水遠不共戴天，那怕流到最後一滴血，我們要打倒日本帝國主義！（全場高呼：打倒日本帝國主義！）</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的侵略，逼使我們不能不起而復仇和自衛，爲了保衛我們的祖國，保衛全世界的和平，。爲了解放我們的同胞和自己，大量的靑年，從各個角落裏像潮水一樣的定上了抗戰的疆場，抗戰的最前綫。</p>
<p>靑年在抗戰的中間表現着　人的英勇，好像生來就是爲關消滅×人的一樣，靑年的將領普遍的受人敬愛，靑年的戰士常是一切精銳部隊的中國。他們爲中華民族解放事業所留下的光榮悲壯可歌可泣的史是踐說不完的。</p>
<p>死守寶山的姚子靑營長和他所領導的全營，在謝晉元團附領導下堅守上海四行倉庫的八百壯士，差不多都是靑年。苦戰擊潰×軍苫米地旅團而殉國的葉成煥團長只有二十五歲，領導燒燬陽明堡×軍飛機二十四架的陳爾聯國長祇有二十三歲。我們可以介紹給大家一位在座的代表鄺超德同志，他是×路軍的靑年代表之一。他巳經作戰過九次，和×人肉搏過三次，有一次他單獨殺死了三個×人，可是他今年還只十八歲呢。（效掌）</p>
<p>中國的空軍，可以說眞正是靑年的空軍。在上海空戰中因爲飛機降落×區，擊斃幾十個×人而壯烈乍殺的閱海文烈士。在武漢空戰中擊落×機十餘架而殉國的李桂丹烈士，以肉彈擅燬×機×艦而同歸於書的沈崇海烈士，和陳懷民烈士，這些流芳千古的民族英雄，年齡都不過二十上下。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>靑年在澈華戰爭中間更是估躍，在東北楊靖宇將軍所領導的少年營，在活動於太行山脈的楊秀林教授所領導下的平津學生游擊隊，在活動於管玲山和大靑山的太原成成中學的師生游擊隊，他們在×後方建立了抗日根據地。同蒲路　工自衛隊，平漢路鐵工破壞大隊，舉行起綫，建立了冀東抗日根據堆的塘山七千礦工，或者全是靑年，或者是以靑年爲骨幹。有一個故事可以說明靑年在游擊戰爭中的智勇變全，有一個靑年號兵在夜襲臨汾車站獲得小勝以後，獨自帶了一只呸號，一枝破槍和九顆手溜彈，暗中偷跑到臨汾城頭上吹起集合號來。×人在城下集合了，他就用手溜彈和步鏵打死了×人至八九十名之多，隨後自己也做了光榮的犧牲。這位無名的靑年眞是新中國新靑年的好榜樣（鼓掌）。</p>
<p>我們靑年不但勇敢的直接參加戰鬥，並且也勇敢地進行種種服務戰爭協助戰爭的工作。上海女實軍楊蕙敏爲四行倉庫的孤軍冒險送電話機和國族。漢口新生活服務團的兒童擦皮鞋献金，許多靑年的救護員，新聞記者，鐵路工人，在砲火之下出入戰場，努力工作，以致犧牲自已的生命。各堆方靑年和兒童的救亡歌詠戲劇工作和站崗放哨捉漢奸的工作，都得到了很大的成績。拓荒劇團的周德佑是一個十八歲的銀行家公子，因爲献身於救亡工作竟因勞瘁過度而死。臨汾民族革命大學的學生拿獲了著名漢奸張慕陶。漢奸首領王克敏的女兒王遵相諫父不從，毅然聲明和他脫離父女關係，寧可跑到香港的工廠中作工釆維持自已生活。</p>
<p>這一切都顯示了中國靑年的無限英勇。更證明了中國靑年中抗戰建國中的支柱，是國家的新生力量，是民族解放的先錄隊。</p>
<p>抗戰鍛鍊了我們靑年，使我們簡直不知道什麽叫做艱苦。我們靑年所表現的艱苦奮鬥的精神，會經使得許多長輩不但改變了對於我們靑年的有法，並且大大的堅定了對於中華民族前途的信念，堅定了抗戰必勝，建國必成的信念。</p>
<p>許多靑年因爲要學習抗戰的理論，難開了自己的家庭和　　，『不怕那關山千萬重』跑到培養抗戰斡部的學校裏來，他們本來的生活常是很好的，很富裕的，可是在這些學校裏的生活却非常刻苦。往往沒有敎室，缺少桌椅燈燭，書籍藥品，睡得很擁擠，穿吃很粗，甚至還要自己抽出時間來修築住的窰洞，種糧食和蔬菜，參加廚房挑水煮飯的工作。但是他們還是不願放棄一分鐘的時間，很緊張的學習，很愉快的用習，雖然下了雪，結了冰，但他們正是很早的起來學冷水洗面，迎着北風跑步爬山，面目高聲唱歌。</p>
<p>他們在各種服務中間常是不計什慶功名利祿，總是以任勞任怨的精神，百折不囘的意志，埋頭苦幹。無論環境志樣的惡劣，他們也絕少有嫖賭貪污媚上欺下的不良習氣。怎樣危險的工作，他們也絕少有畏縮不前的。</p>
<p>爲什麽我們能够如此？除了爲祖國的解放除了爲抗戰，難道還能有其他的原內嗎？</p>
<p>抗戰本身就是一個最好的學校，抗戰敎育了我們靑年，使我們從新認識自己和所處的時代，我們的思想迅速的進步着，使我們不再悲觀懷疑，不且只顧一人一時的享受而以遠離政治爲淸高。抗戰更教育了我們只有發動民衆，組織民衆，武裝民衆，依靠民素，才能戰勝一切×人，克復一切困難，我們這一代的靑年大多數都願意把所有一切交給祖國，都一心致力於實現獨立自由幸福的三民主義共和國，爲中國人民的事業，我們願意奮鬥到底，犧牲一切。我們熱烈的追求世界上社會科學和進步學說，我們愛好真理比愛好自己的生命還強。</p>
<p>抗戰敎育我們，使我們有了偉大的眼光和冷靜的頭腦。我們看出抗戰的勝利，需要長期的耐必的奮鬥，我們的大公無私的襟懷配合着委曲求全的苦心，卽使靑年深抱成見的人有時也不能不受到感勳。</p>
<p>今年六月間安吳堡靑訓班有一同學，到晉西一個游擊隊中任班長的工作。這個游擊隊的隊長是一個固執守舊的人。在『七七』抗戰建國的紀念日的會場上購演說：『今天是我們國恥紀念日』引得有些　的戰士們笑了。隊長就把笑的人禁閉起來。又一次一個戰士唱了義勇軍進行曲，隊長說：『淡有下命令爲什麽唱』就也把他禁閉了。隊長的壓迫非常可怕，甚至無原無故發了皮氣，用脚把戰士的身體都踢壞了。這類事情引起大家非常的不滿。這位靑年却總是想盡方法來說服大家，消除大家對隊長的隔閔。</p>
<p>但是後來他這一班有些隊員因爲實在忍受不住隊長的橫　，竟開了小差，又生怕他們所愛戴的班長受嚴厲的處分，就把槍都留下來，隊長知道了，一定要槍斃這個班長，引得許多軍官和縣長都來說情，結果這個班長被隊長拉去打了四十大板。手巳打得紅腫了；他走開時又忘了敬禮，於是又被拉囘去再打四大板</p>
<p>雖然如此，他却還是看得抗戰高于一切，毫不因此沮喪。他不但自己照常的積極工作，並且還是繼續鼓勵大家努力安心的工作，無論如何，要保持部隊上下的團結。直到後來，這位靑年，在自願祖負最艱苦的任務，到太原城裏去偵察×情時，不幸被捕犧牲了。中國靑年在這裏表現的精神，是一種多麽偉大的精神！</p>
<p>另有幾個靑年在華北一個軍隊的劇團裏工作。軍官們輕鄙他們，而且疑嫉他們。有意和他們爲難。有一次他們嬰這個劇團第二天就演出一個戲來，還要演得好。劇團裏的靑年毫不遲疑的就囂夜編戲排戲，第二天果然演出來了，而且使軍官們看了非常歎服，軍官們逐漸了解他們只有一片爲抗戰而鞠躬盡瘁的赤胆忠心，他們每天淸早冷水洗了險就爬山。一個權位最高，原來也最反對他們的老年的秘書長，後來也加入了他們爬山的隊伍，並且把護兵也取消。有一次他對他們講話說『你們愛國的精神實在好，中國的前途全在你們這一輩靑年身上』！說着就流下眼淚來了。</p>
<p>在抗戰中我們靑年的社會地位一天一天的提高了。過去社會上人很多看不起靑年，以爲靑年不中用，只有五分鐘的熱度一見了靑年都說娃娃能幹些什麽？現在這種心理是逐漸打破了。有些戰區有不少縣長是靑年，因爲他們做事認眞，人格高尙，只知下鄕工作，不知升官發財，人民都很愛戴他們，叫他們是抗日縣長，抗日愈發展，政府和人民對於靑年的需要就愈多，靑年的地位也就更加重要。</p>
<p>蔣委員長說：『靑年爲革命之先鋒隊，爲國家之新生命，舉凡社會之進化，政治之改革，莫不有賴於靑年之策動以爲其主力。……常念中國革命，爲久遠而艱鉅之事業，對吾富有革命精神繼續革命事業之靑年愛之有如至寳；換言之，中正實視吾靑年即爲余之生命。蓋必有無數之革命靑年，結合而成一偉大的力量，前仆後繼，百折不囘，而後可以力行主義，捍衛國家，復興民族，以達成國民革命最後之目的。』</p>
<p>我們靑年，今天巳經是國家民挨的棟樑，我們要負起十分艱鉅的貴任，時代不但要我們負起抗戰的任務，並且要我們負起興國建國的任務，三民主義新中國的鑰匙是操在我們手中，我們的一舉一動，都要關係着中華民埃的前途。</p>
<p>中國靑年今天不但在中國有很大的作用，有很高的地位，對於世界也有很大的作用，很高的地位。</p>
<p>英國的艾登說：『中國的抗戰挽救歐洲的民主。』</p>
<p>美國的學聯寫信給中國的學聯說：『坦率言之，卽吾人之生命與安全亦悉頓諸君所肩負之兵刃。』</p>
<p>各國的靑年現在都同情我們，尊重我們，不斷的用種種方法來援助，鼓勵和慰問我們。我們的國際朋友，世界學聯派了代表團跑到中國來看我們。我們到歐美慮處受他們熱烈的歡迎，他們都贊揭中國靑年英勇，都說中國靑年是世界靑年的模範。</p>
<h3>願一切同情抗戰友人注意</h3>
<p>— 宋慶齡</p>
<p>關於中國工業合作社，本人顧竭誠向一切抗戰的友人，作一個簡略的介紹。</p>
<p>在當前的戰爭中，日本不銷毀滅了我們的家庭，幷且爲要驅使我們的人民完全成爲它的農業的奴隸，它尤其用盡一切方法毀滅我們的近代工業，我們百份之七十五的機器工業經巳給他破壞了，或是沒收了，百多萬工人失掉了職業。我們决不以失望來回答這種殘暴的行爲，就是在這樣的戰爭期間，我們的人，我們的政府，都巳經下了决心，來舊新恢復我們的生產力，在內地各處。甚至于在日人佔據了的鐵路沿綫，我們建起成千的小規模工廠，因爲要使廣大的人民參加，使他們的犧牲獲得代價使這種建設，成為民主性的，所以這些工廠都是以合作的方式建設起來的，透過這些合作社，希望我們將難民吸收，使花在日人佔領區域難民營的千百萬賑款，由消耗的布施變爲生產的資本，目前在這些區域裏，貧困的難民不過是養活在那裏等着日人準備好了的時候隨時去剝削他們而巳。工業合作社能够維持內地市場的穩定，這樣卽令日人將一切的城市都佔領了，也可得免除農村經濟的紊亂，工業合作社可以安挿失業工人，供給軍隊的服裝糈防止饑荒以及其他因經濟脫節所可引起的困難，支持長期抗戰，使日本佔領了我們的城市，絲毫得不到利益，這個運動需要各地正義和進步人士的扶助，賑濟機關應當將原定送往日人佔領區域的賑狄捐助與這些合作社，工業廠家應當將購買機器原料的信用，給與這些工業合作社。這樣來扶助這　永久的生產，賑濟事業也就可以重建自己的未來市場，愛國的銀行家，應當放款，有訓練的靑年，應當投效，充任技術人員，凡一切對于這個中步的運動的扶助，我們的政府和人民都是無任歡迎的！</p>

<h3>陳誠將軍談戰局　三五年中我必驅逐×軍　×在佔領區內困難重重</h3>
<p>【重慶廿二日航訊】外息、目下指揮贛湘與鄂南戰事之陳記將軍、爲中國能將之一、廿二日下午在此招待新聞記者宣稱、</p>
<p>吾人不望在今年或明年獲勝、但若續戰三行年、吾人終必獲最後勝利也</p>
<p>將軍檢討戰局、謂日本不特不能續得任何進步且在其佔據區內爲華軍所困、日軍陣線後之區城內、除游擊隊與流動除不計外、尙有中國正規軍六十師之多、</p>
<p>鄂北日軍集中步兵三師騎兵一旅、卽第三第十三第十六師團之兵力、圖包圍湯恩伯將軍所統之華軍、但在棗陽北　戰五畫　後、日軍包園計劃、已遭失敗、現新野駐有孫運仲、劉汝明二將軍之部隊、大洪山駐有劉和鼎將軍所統之一電團、日軍巳不能向襄樊前展、</p>
<p>至於渠所指揮之南昌戰區、日軍佔領南昌、在軍事上對華軍有利、因此後華軍無須保衛修河以南之各區、可使華軍避免某數方面之進攻、日軍目下在一廣大乏區城中從事防守戰、因彼等乏實力、巳因進政南昌而大爲减損也、華軍向高安南昌之反攻、巳阻止日軍達到包圍湖北以北與湖南以南之華軍之目的、現日電之實力巳大損、華軍乘機在某數點囘擊。是以反攻之力量、完全在吿人手中、華軍日於四月二十二日向用昌反攻、雖未能收復該城、但有數百人會兩要衝入該城、惜不能在城內站定耳、又吾等巳佔領南昌九江間鐵路之某數點、是以日軍運輸殊爲不便、浙江江西間之鐵路雖被切斷、但華軍仍能藉更南之公路與海濱、維持交通、此外南　以南與東之華軍、皆能自給、現已改爲流動部隊、</p>
<p>日軍現有步兵三十師騎兵三旅分佈下列各地、廣東與海南島共三師、滬、鐵路區與　南共兩師、贛湘與鄂北共五師、襄樊區三師、另騎兵一旅、皖北興平漢鐵路共兩帥、贛北津浦與山東鐵路區共四師、冀察共三師半、豫東與　淸鐵路區共兩師、晉省五師、晉北與綏遠共兩帥</p>
<p>中國最惡劣之時期、今已過去矣、將軍坦白承認中國最危急之時代、首在蘆變發生之初、當時華北對於戰和問題、意見紛歧、次在首都陷落之後、中國在此一役確曾受慘烈之損失、日軍如不能於攻陷南京與漢口二役中、使華軍受决定全局之敗鎖、則此種機會永不再來矣、將軍之結語曰、中國必能獲最後勝利、此僅爲時間問　耳、</p>
<p>陳誠將軍又稱、日本目下在佔領區中遭遇四大問題、乃缺少時間、勞工、資本、與政治十及社會上之穩定力是也、據稱日本之財力、已渭耗殆盡、實無力發展佔領區域、蘇聯五年計劃與備國之四年計劃、皆須鉅大資本、始能賞行之、日本現缺乏資力、是以日本水不能開發中國之資源、以克服中國也、依照慣例、投資開發任何土地三所至五年後、始能獲利、日本向東三省投資以來、巳八年於茲、然仍不能贏得任何利益、又日本如欲以中國之資源以克服中國、必先須攷慮「時間』問題、目下助日本之中國之勞工、爲數極少、中國之工人、皆不願興日本合作、或援助日本開發中國之　源、是以實無維持佔領區域之政治上與社會上穩定力之可能、</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦廿六日電】今日下院開會、議員韓德森問曰一日人聲稱　將中國海岸加以封鎖、此事如果實行、是否輿國際公法大相衝突、政府是否將派遣兵艦護送中國領海之商船、以　保護。」勃氏答稱。「現因謠傳如此、故進一步保護英國航業一端、已在緊急攷慮中矣、」勃氏又承認「日人此舉、係遠背國際公法」、議員法勒郤氏又問、「政府是否將採取報復手段、抑或僅以派艦保護了事」、答稱「今日余不願再有表示、惟余可確吿者、卽政府對於此事極爲重視也、」</p>

<h3>記中山德泰（上）</h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>日本反戰軍人之先覺者</p>
<p>×軍第六師團參謀官中山德泰少佐、自鄂城步行至豫鄂邊界某村、向我投誠、中山目下在鄂、豫、贛三省軍中服務、</p>
<p>——路透社電——</p>
<p>【本報特的長沙航訊】得到第×戰區司令長官司令部參會處的同意，記者於五月十五日下午，赴長沙近郊的長宮部特務營營部，訪問反戰的日軍見習士官中向泰德君。記者在修水附近楊總部時，就聽到中山君以大智大勇的精神，跳出侵略軍的牢籠，當時就　去拜訪他一次，不幸以一日路程的錯差，他巳經過修水取道銅鼓來長沙了。想不到他相去十日，就獲償識荆的夙望，</p>
<p>中山泰德君住在一座學校型的建築裏，和時務營第三連的弟兄們一起生活着。經過第三連連長的介紹，知道當記者走上一樓時，有一位穿着白色土布短衫褲，著拖鞋，在甬道中緩步的短而健的靑年，果然就是我所想訪問的人物</p>
<p>我們緊緊握手。在掌心裏，交融着反侵略，反法西的熱流。</p>
<p>記者不懂日語；中山君不懂英語，却能講簡單的華語——這是他在本國學校裏讀書時的課稈之一，他用中音讀出我名片上的姓名和職業，又縣懂我說才從修水前線返來的話以後，一面說：『辛苦！辛苦！』一面伸手邀我到三樓他的臥室裏去坐。</p>
<p>我首先對他自動的以行動來答覆日本軍閥的壓迫表示敬意。看他的未上沒有蚊帳，又道了招待不週的歉意。他說：『沒有關係。中國的弟兄們也都沒有蛟帳。』——那天傍晚，我和情報科長陳陣先生談及。他說巳在購買了。</p>
<p>接着我們開始筆談。</p>
<p>中山泰德君是日本大返人，今年二十四歲。日本公民學校及陸軍士官學校速成科學業。幼年時，家境貧寒，靠賣報（每天可賺八角錢）來維持家庭，自己因此也獲得讀書的機會。他對於日本社會的不滿，可說自小就有很深刻的感覺。昭和十三年（一九三八年）六月二十八日，他把四十八歲的母說和二十歲的妻子，遺棄在大阪的材木店裏，自已奉命來到中國，在第六師團本部參謀部任見習士官，進出長江兩岸的戰地。佔領武漢以後，雖經一度盛傳日「支一戰爭即可結束；運輸當局且曾有調派船隻。遣送士兵返國的準備，但自將委員長宣言發表以後，日本士兵們返國的美夢便破滅了，他也獵續在武昌咸寧間的粤漢路上隨軍移動着，一年來的遠征，使他認識了對「支」戰爭的眞相。他毅然决然的放棄了他少社軍人的前程，投奔到我國的神聖的民族革命戰爭的陣營裏來。</p>
<p>他雖然直到五月初才到長沙，但早在二月十六日就巳經歸開駐在鄂城的第六師團本部。就是在那天晚上，他從宿營地潛逃出來，沿公路向南步行，因爲要避開日軍的耳目，到拂曉只走了四十里路，只得躱進樹林裏隱蔽起來。那時他還穿着日本軍服，身邊帶着六十元日鈔，他想用來購買一套中國農民的服裝，當地的老百姓給了他一套他所需要的衣服，却退還他所付的日鈔。他知道六十口街附近有中國的游擊，於是他央請一艘漁船帶他前去。一天的水程，便到了月的地。湘鄂贛邊區民衆游擊總指揮部的政治部主——一位武漢大學的學生——歡迎着他，立卽爲他安排宿處。幾天以後，又經過××舊，××街，在××遇見了游擊大隊長楊俊。他就在那邊開始參）加了游擊隊，先後住了一個半月。楊大隊長懂得日文，但不能講語，他們每天筆談。生活雖然艱苦，精神上却很愉快。就在這時候。他眞實了解了中華兒女爲民族解放而鬥爭的偉大。</p>

<h3>日本與德意軸心</h3>
<p>— 石橡譯</p>
<p>日本和反共軸心國家間的關係問題、現在似乎得到日本嚴密地注意和考慮、這是由於德國要求日本加入億意軍事同盟、反抗民主陣線的英、法、蘇、波等國的提案所引起的、但是、出乎我們預料的、是日本人士對於這個提案、意見竟十分糾紛起來、一不管軸心國家間怎樣交換軍事同盟的意見、日本總是疑盧着不熱心、生怕自己陷落在這個盟約裏、不能自拔、日本願意參興一個直接對抗蘇聯的同盟、她反對加入一個廣泛的協定裏、因爲這樣德國會要求日本艦隊、在歐戰發生時開到歐洲去、而不給她任何補償的、日本疑惑著德意想出小小的報酬、得到大大的代價、</p>
<p>德日高務協定、據說進行很不順利、因爲德國主張用黃金去支付兩國間的貿易、代替以貨易貨的辦法、但是、日本却十分缺乏外幣的、所以就目前形勢觀察、德日兩國尙不至密切合作、並且、日本的利益主要在遠東、而德國的却在歐洲、將來歐戰如果發生、日本加入德意方面作戰、那意她所能得到的構益一定很小、何况民主國家很有結合或强固的反法四斯侵略陣綫、日本有收北的可能呢、德國和意大利不能在財政上去援助日本征服中國、日本也就不願和她們訂軍事同盟、去對付英、法和美國、因爲她還夢想從這些國家專得到一筆借款呢、</p>
<p>就德國方面來講、德國也不願日本在中國作軍事上的冒險、因爲這樣德國在歐洲發生戰爭時、不僅失掉優勢、並且直接摧殘了德國在中國商業的利益、所以德國企圖著調停中日戰爭、恢復中德兩國友好關係、促進兩國人民的親睦、雖然過去德國曾有召回德國在華顧問的事件、最近所傳中德兩國訂立的以貨易貨的商務協定、更可證明德國雖仍然和日本往來、但她仍願和中國維持友好　係、日本請求德茂勿　軍用材料運往中國、似乎沒有引起德方的注意、同樣、日本說她或可以考慮將靑島　讓給德國、在柏林也沒有若何反應、德國人士深深地感覺到運種誘惑物的價値、當與她和中國斷絕邦交而受的損失相比較時、實在是太微末不足道了、所以不管在表面上她們的利益和目標如何相同、儘管兩國使節往返、交換虎意、她們中間仍然隔在一道鴻溝、使日本與軸心國家分離、不能接近、</p>
<p>總之、她們彼此只關心自己的利益、並且想盡可能的利用在軸心中的地位去獲得最大限度的權益、只要她們彼此間的利害不發生衝突、她們可相安無事、但是一旦彼此間利益不能協調、發生爭執時、那麽她們的一切協定很快地就會崩潰了、</p>

<h3>懲汪的呼聲</h3>
<p>自從中央社正式宣布汪精衛往來日本上海之間等消息以後，注精衛平素主唱的「反共」「和平」等論調乃完全破產，而其××××××××的行動，亦更引起全體中國人的×××××××××，甚至還引起汪精衛親信份子的××××（雖然也有是故意作態），而　外僑胞對汪的××，可說日益激昂，而懲汪的呼聲，要求明令××汪精衛的呼籲，亦巳喧騰於國內海外的報章了！關於汪精衛目前一切言行之如佝援助日××××××××，本報今日社評已有所指陳，我們謹敢祈望中央能夠審察民族國家的利害，俯順國內海外的輿情，對汪實行××××的適當處置，則不僅將增強前線的戰鬥力，並且將大有助益於國民精神總動員，抗戰建國事業與世界眞正和平事業，實利賴之！</p>
<h3>蘇聯最高會議</h3>
<p>蘇聯最高會議，於廿五日晚開幕，出席代表有一千二百人，代表一百種民族以上，在此整個資本主義世界和一切殖民地半殖民地都給新的大戰烽火所陷覆的時候，這個在獨立自由與幸福的廣大的國土上所召集的最高會議，自然値得全世界人士的注意了。</p>
<p>從三月十日至廿一日的聯共十八次大會，會經把蘇聯如何忠誠推行和平政業維護世界和平維議民主制度援助被壓迫民族反抗侵略的政策，而且會經吿訴我們，由於蘇聯國民經濟的發展與人民文化與物質生活的提高，和國防力量的强化，足以保證蘇聯兮後必能忠誠與順利執行此種政策。這次最高會議，將對於外交，經濟國防種種問題，作更具體的討論，而製成代表全蘇聯各民族人民大衆公同的决議案，對於蘇聯本國的鞏固與發展，對於國際反侵略反法四斯運動的發展與成就，一定有更重大的買献！</p>
<p>我國抗戰以來，二十餘月的事實證明，蘇聯確是中國最忠實的友邦之一，我們對於蘇聯國家力量的發展與其國際信譽的提高，自然應該表示欣慰與敬賀之情，對於此次一千二百餘人代表百餘民埃的最高會議，自然更應該表示敬意與祝其成功，同時我們要加倍努力學習蘇聯，堅持內都團結，堅决抗×除奸，提高國家實力與威信，加强中蘇友誼，用以稚淮蘇聯全國的援華運動，尤其是用以鼓勵英美法各國的援華制日運動！今日世人將無可否認，中蘇兩大民族力量的發展，將，是世界和平最堅強的保障！</p>

<h3>被困廣州七月餘　英商輪三艘獲釋返港　東安大明大利昨日下午先後駛達　×誣指載軍用品竟登輪騷擾劫掠</h3>
<p>廣州淪陷之初、外國商輪困處廣州珠江及西江河面者、大小凡十餘艘之多、×軍佔領粤垣後、竟藉口河道危險、故意扣留各外輪、直至最近、經各國領事竭力交涉、×方始陸續將各外輪釋放、先後脫險返港者巳有金山、廣西、江蘇等多艘、其他同安公司之廣東號、復安公司之大明號、四邑公司之大利號、則仍被扣留、經駐粤英領事繼續向×交涉、至昨日始行返港、下午四時後相繼抵步、茲將經過探錄如次、</p>
<p>昨日返港</p>
<p>昨日離省返港之英輪、計有同安公司之東安號、復安公司之大明號、四邑公司之大利號、昨日上午八時半離省、各輪事先得接×方通知、啟行前一日將輪中所載貨物、全部起卸、昨晨八時、×方派兵登輪大肆搜索、藉口檢查、恣意騷擾、各輪並無載客、祗有少數外僑秉輪來港、八時半由省河啓碇、東安先行、大明次之、大利殿後、×方未有派輪引導、祇派「帶水」二人、在東安司舵作前導、大明大利則尾隨出口、約九時左右駛至三枝香河面殿後之大利輪司館人誤駛航綫以致擱淺、不能前進、船主即電吿東安大明兩輪求援、兩輪得訊、立卽停航、並由東安輪之×方「帶水」一人渡過大利輪担任司舵、然後繼續前駛、東安大利兩輪駛至虎門外、×方帶水卽　輪返省、兩輪繼續鼓輪來港、東安輪于下午三時抵昂船洲禁海、由本港醫官派員檢疫、三時許駛泊入碼頭、大明輪及大利輪延至入夜始行抵港、</p>
<p>船員談話</p>
<p>據東安輪船員談、廣州淪陷時、該輪卽與各外輪一同駛離碼頭、改泊於沙面附近海面、廣州陷落良久、仍未有返港消息、×兵不時登輪强行搜索、大肆騷擾、輪中五金屬物品、多被×軍掠奪、其他物品、亦被×軍予取予携、本輪在×軍勢力範圍下、無如之何、本輪停航後、給上各部議員、均駐守輪上、×軍當局雖未有禁止各外輪船員登陸、但會恐嚇船員苟非必要、不可冒險、曾有三數人欲一視市面情况、離輪登岸、但登陸時卽被×兵侮辱、遍身搜索、除銀物被沒收外、懷中字據文件亦無幸免、迨入市中、遭站崗×兵毆辱、因此多數船員均不敢登岸、七個半月之時間、困處船中、無異軟禁、</p>
<p>交涉經過</p>
<p>關於上述各輪交涉退港之經過、據記者棎悉、廣州陷落之初、×軍藉口河道水雷未淸除、未能將珠江開放、將各外國商輪扣留于省河、被扣留者、尤以英國商輪爲多、因此英國當局、徇各輪船公司之請求、訓令英駐粤總領、向×方提出交涉、要求早日將被困各輪、釋放囘港、英領奉令、即據理向×領提出交涉、×方竞藉詞諸般推搪、遷延時日、一方面則派出大量×輪往來廣州各鄰進埠、獨霸珠江航權、英領事在此七個月來、雖極力催促×方釋放各輪、但無結果、直至月前經英國當局進一步提出有力交涉、各輪始先後獲釋、昨日返港之東安大利大明三艘、將爲最後離省之一批、三輪原定于一週前與廣西號一同返港、但臨時又接×方通知、改期于昨日啟碇、現尙留于省河者僅餘泉興一艘、</p>
<p>並無軍火</p>
<p>查廣州陷落之初、×方妄指留于慶州之各外輪存有接濟我軍之軍火、故將之扣留、同時並放出謠言、謂各輪港赴省時、載有軍火未曾起卸者、昨日本港外訊、亦有下列紀載「被困于廣州之英商輪四艘今日巳獲日當局准許返囘香港」但祇准載運平常之貨物、其他軍用品須起卸後始能離廣州、但據記者查悉、各輪載有軍用品之說、絕對不確、當各輪由港赴省時所載運者俱屬普通洋貨及糧食等、抵省後經完全起卸、交囘貨主、虎門對鎖之日、各輪均有接載出口貨準備運港、直至昨日離港、始將所有貨物盡數起卸、且各輪在被困期間、迭被×軍搜查、亦無任何軍火搜出、所謂載運軍火一節、絕對無稽、實則×軍作爲留難各外輪之藉口而巳、</p>
<p>死城近況</p>
<p>有商人某君昨日附搭東安輪抵港、記者詢以死城近况、據稱、×軍佔據廣州半載、但至今市內恐怖與紊亂之程度、仍未減于最初淪陷時、留市市民、最初以爲廣州局面不久可以平定、今目覩市內一切、巳陷于死寂、因此亦紛紛離市、近更因我軍反攻日急、外逃者越多、×軍雖極力宣傳市內秩序恢復、但事實之昭示適成相反、無論白盡或夜間、賊匪可以橫行于市區任何繁盛區、僞警察並無械、對于賊匪行刼、不特不能制止、反要迥避、近一月來、市郊游擊隊不時向×軍進娶市內×軍頗形徬徨、雖×方極力掩飾、但每日軍隊調動及傷兵運輸頻繁終不能盡掩外人之耳目、金融方面法幣仍然暢通、×軍强迫行使軍用票、但市民多方拒受、因此×軍用票在市面流通爲數甚少云、</p>

<h3>李主席漢魂　銳意改進保甲制度　確定自治經費取消零抽辦法　任用青年幹部人員提高待遇</h3>
<p>（韶關特訊）保甲制度、為政治設施之基礎、如辭理完善、一切政治措施、俱能惟行順利、粵省地方自治、開始辦理有年、惟因墨守繩法、且經費短少、故迄未獲得完滿成續、因而影響行政推進者至大、査審省地方自治、</p>
<p>過去缺點</p>
<p>約有下列幾項、（一）鄉鎭長多未經訓練、卽經訓練者、亦多欠認切實、現在全省區鄉鎮里保甲長、不下七萬人、旣多未經訓練、對於自治保甲工作推進、自不容易、（二）自治經費困難、鄉　長生活無法解經、保甲長辦公費每月亦僅得三角、貧瘠之地、且再減免、因而鄉鎭保甲長之總立、未能提高、在不好之生活與低下地位中、鄉經長自不易有社會優秀人士充任、自然減少工作效非、（三）年來各縣辦理保甲經費、係按戶徵抽（自治戶捐）、每戶月收半毫至一、毫不等、數目旣零、次數必頻、人民亂感騷擾、保、長亦覺麻煩、　方常常發生不協調、影響自治推行者最　、（四）我國社會、芷在除舊布新、此時、地方上每每發生新舊掃力之磨擦、青年指前輩為落伍腐化、前輩斥靑年為幼稚輕浮、遂至許多地方事業、經消耗於此種新舊勢力下協調中、廣東為革命策源地、在政治經、濟、文化等、都佔優厚條件、但政治卒無法推進清明者、自治保甲辦理未完善、實為最大原因、頃聞李主席漢魂於就職之始、卽濸見此中　結、賽維</p>
<p>改造計劃</p>
<p>現已大致决定、其主要內容、（一）第一步確定全省每年自治經費九百萬元、由省府統籌支配、將現在零碎自治經費之征抽、一律取銷、以省繁擾、該項新定自治經費、一部用於訓練、自洽幹部、一部撥充自治人員生活費公費、其薪給數目、雖一時尚未參如預期、但俟全省財政整理，省庫收入增加後、第二步則再將經費增加、提高自治人員生活費、辦公費、在省府改組後五個月中、因抗戰彩響、省庫收入雉少、但因竭力樽節一支出尙非相抵、其中不殲之數、有許多是奉命撥付者、將來可以領囘、且如何整頓稅捐、在合理而不碍民生之下增加收入財戰、已有計劃、省廣收人、當可漸漸加增、自治費之統籌、實有極大把握、（二）各級自治人員、如鄉陳保甲長等、决以曾經訓練、或有經騐之優秀靑年任之、提起社會蓬勃朝氣、而地方上之前輩、則居於指導地位、在子弟輩之青年、固願獲得老成父兄輩之提携、在父兄輩之老成當亦樂為靑年子弟輩之指導、如此配合、旣已消除　擦、復可增大力量、在自治人員之地位、生活提高、中加上人事之融洽協調、及取銷零碎捐抽、招致民衆擁護、相與　力、萬衆一心、地方之自治保甲事業、必能雷厲推行、計日收效、此種計劃、不日可提出省務會議過通、公布施行、</p>

<h3>紅『藍』片與三原色片</h3>
<p>蘇聯的『女壯士』是一部紅「藍」二原色的彩片、開映之後、與論界一致稱頌、但是關於彩色成績的贊美、却有人提出異議、在這裏、我相把書本子上所看到的一些原理提供參考、不過希望不要以『內行』見義、澆冷了我的就敎的誠意、</p>
<p>色、有光色與顏料色之別、太陽光裏雜有長短不同的光波、七色的呈現、便是由於光波的長短不同·白光通過了紅色膠片便呈現紅色、它的理由在於：紅色膠片時祇有紅光波能够通過·於是呈現了紅色·因為相等成份的紅（Red）藍（Blue）錄（Green）三種光色混合成白色、所以通常稱紅綠為光色的三原色、這和顏料色的三原色不同、就光色講、相等成份的藍綠二色混合成靑緣色（Blue—Green）、因此、兩份的靑綠色與一份的紅色混合、也成白色、這裏所稱為紅「藍」便是靑綠、我們這就可以看出、從三原色獲所能得到的色彩、在紅『藍』二原色裏也能得到、不過因為配合的成份不同、所以更為麻煩、其實、紅藍混合成黃（Yellow）、紅綠混成品紅（Magenta）、將黃與綠或品紅與藍作為二原色、也能得合樣的結果、物體顏色的產生與顏料色相同、一件物體、能吸收綠光波而反射紅與籃、便呈黃色、能吸牧紅光渡而反射藍與綠、便呈現品紅、所以、譬如用三原色的鏡攝取黃色物體時、紙在紅片藍片上留有相當成份的影子、而綠片朋無、用紅『蓋』二原色的鏡頭攝取黃色物　時、紅片『藍』片（靑綠片）上都有影子、但其成份却又不同、這兩種拍攝的片子、當還原地映射出去的時　、在色彩的論理上、應該桔果相同、在這裏、我們可以看出、在成份的配合方面、兩原色比三原色難、在拍　的手續方面、兩原色比三原色簡單、無論如何、這次蘇聯拍　兩原色彩片能有現在的成績、不能不說是相當的成功、而値得人們的欽佩、</p>
<h3>滬上電影院　畸開發達　五家在建築　四家談判中</h3>
<p>上海這地方、可算天堂地獄、苦樂懸殊、眞是不可思議、居民將近五百高、把孤島擠得滿坑滿谷、各種生意、利市二倍、尤其縣樂埸所、那一天不是日夜客滿、許多游藝商人、樂得生財有進、據說又有五家電影院、正在積核議建中、秋李將陸相開幕、這五家地點、【一】在麥特赫司脫路愛文義路口、【二】麥特赫司脫路　安寺路相近、【三】靜安寺【四】、福煦路金門大戲院續近、【五】貝當近徐家匯、那幾家名稱尙未决定、還有四家因無適當地願、一時恐不易見諸事實吧、</p>

<p>路明最近介紹一新人與藝華、名『曹娥』、嬌小活潑、在「三集化身姑娘」中初試鏡頭、</p>
<p>李萍倩結束「金銀世界」之後手進行「生死恨」一劇、聞此劇晚胎於默片的「難為了妹妹」、而由陳燕燕與王引主演、因為陳燕燕已好久沒有做戲了、</p>
<p>談瑛前往香港探望程步高、業己返滬，</p>
<p>宣傳己久之『坦己』古裝片、原定王次龍導演、但王已去港、故藝華方面已另選文逸民擔任、至於主演人、或非貂斑華、此事還在攷慮中、</p>
<p>倉　秋的外子王守迅、近亦與藝華訂了長合同，</p>

<h3>清從民眾英勇殺×紀</h3>
<p>— 葉耐冰</p>
<p>【中央社戰地通訊】記者要特別把淸（遠）從（化）民衆抗戰的事實，　作詳盡地報吿，為的是粵漢南站的民衆，以淸從的為最能發揮威力，克盡天職，保守得着他們的家鄉，創造出許多可　可泣的壯烈而偉大的史實。</p>
<p>自從廣州失陷後，×騎便跟着侵佔了從化數的南段卽流溪水（土名從化河）之西南一角，和花縣南邊的邊緣。一直到現在，還是如此。但×人的勢力，也會經伸張到北面的淸遠縣來。自然啦，×人自盤據廣州後　時刻都想打　粵漢綫。×人要進北犯，淸遠的琶江區，便首當其衝了。淸逮位在從化花縣之北。粵返路正憤跨其東、琶江區又正在該縣的東南，恰是鐵路的右邊，距離廣州約一百華里。</p>
<p>濟遠民衆著名强悍，而又擁有許多淸械砲火。姓氏的械鬥，儼然國家的交戰，殺人　村，在消孫裏頭，司空見慣的，可是到了抗戰的關頭，我們的民衆，便把內鬥的力量，改為打擊××，把守自己的家門，至于從化的民衆呢，因為被暴×直接踐踏到身上來，和受消達的影響也很警覺，也同樣地勇敢，參加抗戰，把守家門，不敎胡馬踐越他們的祖宗的薯陵所在地了。</p>
<p>首次抗戰</p>
<p>去年十月底，×人佔據了從化縣的街口壚以南一帶（太平場神歲）後，便時常由　口壚沿淸從公路出沒於桅杆市一帶（從化城西北十餘里琶江口東南六七十里）村鄉，搶刦財物，强掠糧食猪牛，後來習以為常，竟勒令鄉民每天要拿出若于糧食和猪牛，送到街口爐×營，以車轉運他處。幷聲明如果不遵命，卽放火燒村，格殺不貸。當初桅杆一帶的民衆，以勢力　弱，也無可奈何，衹得忍氣吞聲，誰料　×獸心無　，慢慢地更肆無忌憚，便當試通過從化侵入淸遠邊境。淸遠的民衆，當然不肯干休了，遂立卽起來抗戰。</p>
<p>去年十一月十六日×兵七十餘人，並以兩部機器脚　取造尖兵，便由從化侵入淸遠交界邊境的地方。那兒正常有一度淺水河。淸遠的自衛團，早就有了戒備，把哨兵埋伏在河之北岸，等到×人到了相當距了，立卽射擊，當堂打死×尖兵兩名，並奪獲自動腳踏車兩部。其餘的×人，曉得淸遠民衆要抵抗他們，而且打死他們，於是便忙亂地潰退了。自衛團中有十二人，是最勇敢的，他們竟然乘勝追擊，一直追到十五里以外的桅杆市纔囘轉來。這是淸遠民衆弟一次抗戰。是役我死了四人，傷了兩人，×兵傷了十多人，死的數目總在廿人以上。</p>
<p>×野心未死，報復心急，十七八　日，×在桅杆市車站投信惑恐嚇說不日必定來攻打淸遠。我當無所長忌，也不置信、祇有準備×來，誓死抵抗（未完）</p>

<p>她却沒有囘答，用着她敎他的媚　雅的舉止向門走去。</p>
<p>『再會吧，金敎授。』她淸脆地說。</p>
<p>唐寗街的實驗室沈弱在黑暗中。但是希金的心境更黑暗得多呢。他在悲苦的追憶。覺得自已實是大愚笨了，太自私了。心底又感到無限的寂寞。</p>
<p>他懊喪的立起身，扭亮檯燈想做些事。袖口印無意中開了錄音機的機鈕。靜寂室內中便發出了刺耳而難聽的聲音來：『我來的時候就洗過了臉和手。眞的』！</p>
<p>他激動地把機鈕關上。但是忽然在他身後的門口又，一個美麗淸脆的聲音。柔和的說：</p>

<h3>今天加山足球義賽　南華與聯隊會戰　侯容生投入南華今天上陣　下午五時在加路連山開賽</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】南華體育會遣派南遊的足球隊、改期本月卅日開拔、因而上星期六遇雨停止的義賽、卒在今天舉行、球緣斷且續、迷民夠眼福、屆時加山上、必添無限風光、蓋此役乃南華開拔前的貢献、亦是足球季之最尾聲、</p>
<p>為　胞請命、南華球人素來不惜舉足之勞、刻下將南遊、籍此練習、乃一舉兩得的事、復蒙聯隊諸將、熱誠襄助、完成義舉、眞是功德無量、</p>
<p>侯容生投人南華麾下、隨軍出征、因而今天南華陣裏、發現容生的名宇、後方守衛力、亦因有容生而增加、惟聯　原定陣綫、容生本在其列、今因他易幟、遂由李安納反串、担任右內衛職、月前港澳埠際賽、李安納曾偶彈此調、演出不錯、今天重彈、想又有一番佳作、</p>
<p>聯隊陣線、雖編排未云完整、然各個技術、均臻上乘、倘於戰時能找得諒解的合作、自然全隊必有妙美的演出、惟內衛以李安納及　尼維路充任、終是不慣、雖或戳力以赴、將仍難免不露破綻、全隊弱點、亦在於是、</p>
<p>中堅挪爾氏、乃海軍中人、名兒很陌生、然料其了夫必有可取、復得許竟成及夏仙一人人左右相呼應、前衛線當不弱、惟內衛終不可靠、他們為後衛屏障、到時顧後瞻前、勢必吃力、若然前線能充分發揮其威力、尙司滅少他們後顧之憂、</p>
<p>南華則編成至合理想的陣綫、像得天衣無縫、雖劉松生　是慣充前衛的、然他供球工夫至隹、靠他接濟前線必能勝任、但地旣負責供球、須常出擊、倘因守位稍空而予人以後、便會令到在其後面的埃容生、關縣太忙、然容生新歸隊、必異常賣力、越忙越會演出本領、</p>
<p>前線有李惠堂為統帥、輔助又得入、則攻勢之銳、料非聯隊如此內衛所能抵禦的、故南華得勝、乃意料中事、</p>
<p>會戰地點在加山、下午五時開始、門票分一元、六角、三角三種、錄兩陣如下</p>
<p>（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>今天棒球有劇戰　南華逢友啤　看誰能保持不敗的地位</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）無論幹何種事業、勤必有功、試看參加本屆公開捧球聯賽的友啤隊、原是平平無奇的義勇軍隊的北身、但因邇來勤於練習、技術大進、全隊整個的聯絡、亦臻於縝密、故出師以來、兩戰皆捷、一躍而有勁旅之稱、</p>
<p>友啤在前戰勝西洋會原不為奇、最難能的却是對岷甸奴一役、竟控制全局、把人材平均的岷隊弄到舉止失措、以九對四的比數獲得勝利、而其因有此勝、遂轉移一般看客的眼光、記定它是本屆有力足以爭標的主角、</p>
<p>今天又為友講出師之期、剛　遇着前猶未　敢績的南華會、因此、各為保持不收地位計、遂形成此役的重要性、</p>
<p>南華以前祇出賽一次、所遇的又是六隊中實力較弱的西洋、故其眞實力量、當時猶未盡量發揮出來、然各員都是輪老手、全隊聯絡亦佳、</p>
<p>投手李仲振、是一位宿將、工夫老練、手段不凡、但他是上了年紀的人、氣力稍差、若天氣淸凉一點、他尙可支持至七局之久、否則極其量投至五局、便感軟化了、所以今天南華的成敗問題、須看李氏投球能否支持下去而判定、</p>
<p>分別雙方人材論、南華多宿將、其防守優於攻擊、友啤多後起、其攻勢勝於守勢、故各有千秋、難分軒、且待戰事結局時、乃能知勝敗、</p>
<p>下午二時半開賽、地點加賂連山海軍球埸、門票祇五角一種、但座位不多、欲免額滿見遺、須早到場、錄兩陣如下、（球場太歲）</p>
<p>職手　南華會　友碑隊</p>

<h3>菲島兩臺杯選手　在滬獲全勝　……山渣士擊敗卞遜　……菴邦戰勝李國璠</h3>
<p>【廿二日滬訊】菲島台杯選手、山渣士與菴邦自非赴美參加台杯賽、昨下午道經上海、上海草地網球會特邀作表演賽、共計單雙打三埸、在法商總會硬地球場舉行、中西人十圍觀者五六百人、結果單雙打三場、菲選手竟獲全勝、兩人雖無特殊高深技術、但年靑力壯、前途造就、未可限量、尤以山氏勝卡遜為難能、表演成績如下、</p>
<p>（一）唐寳嘉　六比四　福勃斯</p>
<p>蔡國基　九比七　柯拉沙</p>
<p>（二）菴邦　六比三　六比一　李國璠</p>
<p>（三）山渣士　二比六　六比一　八比六　卡遜</p>
<p>（四）山渣士　菴邦　八比六　三比六　六比三　卡遜　史規亞</p>
<p>年青力壯　球技佳妙</p>
<p>兩人貌不驚人、菴氏尤瘦細小如童子、以為必非李國璠之敵、豈知體力甚佳、出球穩健、李之失敗、卽在體力不如、穩健亦不及、上場數局、尙能互相對抽應付、入後李精疲力竭、完全陷入慌亂、一再觸網野飛、菴氏則兩角正反對抽、加以上網空壓、頓畢尙從容不迫、第一盤三對三後、一落千丈、形勢突變、第二盤李僅得第二局、山氏對卡遜之戰、上場卡遜縱橫全場、以二比六勝來極易、化第二盤卡已現疲態、奔跑不捷、大約因球季方開始之故、論藝卡在山上、高壓斬削、山確不如、但終聲嘶力竭不敵朝陽方昇之靑年也、</p>
<p>卡雖老練　後勁不佳</p>
<p>第二盤卡成放棄局面、第三盤山愈戰愈勇、其正手對抽、確有住妙表演、卡遜已出球無力、勉强應付耳、由四比二後、卡勉力追成平局、第十局山救球仆地、失却最後决勝一點、卡再追成各五復以六比五居上、但終不能抵擊山之猛抽、連失三局敗北、最後雙打卡遜已無心戀戰、史規亞野球連見、精彩不多、兩菲島靑年、仍精神百倍、山氏之作風、頗領邱飛海、正手甚佳、反手軟弱、其他未展所長、兩人年事正輕、東方將來之　星也、</p>

<h3>戰後的紗廠業　紛紛集中上海　原料被×壟斷以外棉救濟</h3>
<p>戰後沿海各都市相繼淪陷、紗廠業受創慘重、各廠拒絕×方合作、在上海租界區新設紗廠、已完成開工者新生等十家、惟原料為×壟斷、不得已訂購外棉接濟、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>滬為紗廠　萃集之地</p>
<p>我國紡織工　之分　地域、在戰前集中於沿海都市、首推江蘇且有攸久之歷史、蓋以地勢氣候之適官、交通運輸之便利、金融之活動、市場之優良、故其進步更非他省所可及、全國共有一四八廠、而蘇省卽有八八廠、佔總數百分之五九·五、又以上海一埠為發發達、居全國紗廠之領導地位、計有六五廠、佔全省總數百分之七三·九、其中華商三十一家、×商三十家、英商四家、故非特為華商紗廠萃集之地、抑亦為外商紗廠軍心之所在、</p>
<p>戰區紗廠　×方接收</p>
<p>戰後沿海都而相繼淪陷、戰區紗廠大部已燬於砲火、卽能倖免者、則內部機件、亦已不全、同時×方企圖武力接管、所以决無恢復之可能、惟楊樹浦之振華紗廠紗綻一萬三千九百二十八枚、因「市民協會」尤菊孫之關係、經×方核准由合記承租、照常開工紡織、戰區以內各廠已為×方接管開工者、有申新、、水安等廠、但與原有各廠毫無關係、全由×方之非法接收開工、且其中有若干廠有外商關係、×方亦予不顧、雖經交涉無效、</p>
<p>租界新廠　十家開工</p>
<p>淪陷區域內各紗廠一律　决拒絕×方之台作、情願犧牲營業、另在七海租界區域內籌設新廠、惟多係以英美等外商名義設立、業已開工者、據新聲社記者調會所得、（一）信和二萬五千紗錠、（二）協記二千六百紗錠、（三）安達一萬五千紗錠、（四）台豐一萬五千紗錠、（五）新生一萬六千紗錠、（六）啓興六千紗錠（七）榮豐一萬五千紗錠、（八）中紡二萬紗錠、（九）德豐八千三百紗錠、（寳豐一萬紗錠、以上總計十家、其中新生協記、全係華資、</p>
<p>原有開工　各廠紗錠</p>
<p>上海租界內巳開工各廠、在戰能原有之紗錠、（一）申新第二紡織廠五萬六千紗錠、（二）申新第九舫織廠八萬九千紗錠、（三）新裕第一廠二萬五千紗錠、（四）新裕二廠二萬四千紗錠（五）鴻章二萬四千紗錠、（六）永安第三廠六萬三千紗錠、（七）大同紗廠四千七百紗錠、（八）統益紡織廠四萬七千紗錠、（九）勤豐紡織廠四千三百紗錠、（十）崇信紡織廠三萬四千紗錠、以上總共十家、崇信、統益兩家、係英商註冊、申新二廠、已歸美商企業公司管理、</p>
<p>×商所滬　所有紗廠</p>
<p>×商在滬之紗　已開工者、（一）日華紡織廠第三第四第五第六第七、紗錠共十七萬四千八百十六枚、綫錠四萬二千二百九十六枚、（二）內外棉株式會社第一至第九、紗錠共二十八萬零五百三十六枚、綫錠十一萬一千八百八十枚、布機三千八百台（三）上海紡繳公司第一第二第三、紗綻共十一萬九千零二十四枚、綫綻二萬三千三百二十枚、布機二千三百零四台、（四）同興紡織會社紗錠九萬七千枚、綫綻三萬零一百四十枚、布機一千四百十二台、（五）公大東華友康豐申裕　、紗綻共四十四為一千九百四十枚、綫綻共八千二百枚、布機七千台、</p>
<p>英商怡和　綸昌各廠</p>
<p>英商在滬原有各廠、今已完全恢復開工、（一）怡和紡織公司、怡和公益楊樹浦紗錠四萬零九百七十六枚、布機二千一百三十五台、（二）綸昌紡織漂染印花有限公司綫錠三千六百四十枚、布機一千一百三十台、英商出紡之廠僅公益一家、其所產之紗、尙不足其他三廠織布之用、而須購買中日紗廠之紗綫、至於綸昌紡織公司、聞巳裝有紗錠四萬四千枚、竭力設法擴充、以求實行自紡自織自染之政策、但目前英紗之流動市場上者、為崇信統益及新設之信和安達等廠所產之紗、</p>
<p>壟斷原料　訂購外棉</p>

<h3>沙田鄕居</h3>
<p>— 錫棠</p>
<p>道風山下那一座粉籃色的小樓，曾是我的故居，它將永遠繚繞港，我如夢的懷　。</p>
<p>×人的大屠殺迫我離別了家園，使我胞受了　轉流離之苦，然而在沙田我得到了休息·</p>
<p>沙田有澄碧的高空，有靑翠的　山，有雄峻的高峯，有碧藍的海，有淸澈的沙溪，有濃綠的樹，有占勁的蒼松，瀟灑的修竹，嫵媚的野花。國景秀美，和平幽靜，如詩如夢如畫。而我尤愛那韓穆的山與那動盪的海，風起時，我會聽到山風，海風，波濤，松灣，合春播莊嚴偉大的交　曲。</p>
<p>朝午慕夜，最色不同，展開在眼前的不是轉圖書而是詭幻不已，變化　窮的萬花筒，因為隨了太陽之升沉，明月之隱現，雲彩勾　萬紫千紅，海色亦瞬息萬變。</p>
<p>而最神奇瑰麗的莫過於晨光曦微或暮韉迷離之際。黎明的時候，還岫，近山，碧的，岸堤，一　被　罩於氤氳的晨霧裏，晨霧彷　柔澕的氣幕，又彷彿輕疏的珠　，被罩在裏邊的一切景色迷離撲素，若隱若現·這景色恰似一價戴着面紗古國美人·她的神采她的魅力·敎你慕　敎你憧憬，但可望而不可卽。</p>
<p>黃俘的時候，紅日西墜，斜暉反照，霞彩滿天，華光奪目，顏色鮮妍，你會覺得這是霓裳羽衣，或是百花綉錦，我有時好像看見英俊威儀的日神阿波維驅着雄碩雪白的神駒，疾馳歸去，海波亦因此反　而成異彩，幻成另一種迷人的境界於是我又會相信海底下確有珊瑚玉樹裝飾着的水晶宮，我似乎也聽到海的仙樂齊奏，依稀看見海的女神凌波欵步，我期待美人魚出現，我更希冀海上傳來　迷鞏醉魄的Siren的　聲。</p>
<p>至於黃昏的山景呢，那肅穆靜默如修道士的巒山。此時此際也奸條活潑起來了　，幕　籠軍着他們，斜陽也反照着他們，所以順些巒山再不單調的蒼翠或暗綠了。卻是忽而殘組，忽而淡紫，忽而轉籃，或忽而微黑，而漸漸深濃至於濃黑。</p>
<p>道些莊嚴瑰偉而神奇的景色，只有造物者的神華所能點染斷非凡人之所能描摹我對之惟有驚愕凝神讀歡運化，的偉大！</p>
<p>有時我走上道風山，那兒有一地像鵝絨的草坡我喜歡在那兒有落日，欣賞海興山的曉裝，我尤其喜歡　臥在草地上，看　幕徐徐的低華，看一切色素漸漸的消褪，聽一切聲音消消的隱滅，假如是個月夜，地上一切變為濃黑時，月華高照，　空如碧，雲白似雪，於是縹縹渺渺，我欲「羽化登仙」。</p>
<p>假如是個　夜，地上一切變為　黑時，就見端靜的雲天間，繁　璀璨，而因為高臨山頭，穹蒼也就　得特別低矮，彷彿緊緊地罩着　山，於是，我與天之間相距，就那麽近，我一舉手繁星可攀，而且依稀聞繁星的細語。雖夜寒暗襲，但又好像被經柔的雲紗裏住。這麼樣。　　在靜寂無聲中，羣山的機抱裏我與大自然同化。</p>
<p>雖是想起家來的時候不免惆悵悲忿，然而從無去國離鄉之感，亦未　頺廢悒國。因為家園相中不遠，如要，三個，頭內就可以到家。而且每天三次快車，每次都　來廣州的消息，我看見車中廣州的來客就覺得慰安，覺得親切，因為他們又平安出險。</p>
<p>人生的無常。世態的　忽，有時縱會撩起輕愁，但如夢的氤　，如書的美景足以滌壽塵思俗慮，使人超然有出世之悲。</p>
<p>然而我並不因此就忘却祖國的　鼓烽煙。旬于淸晨聽到幾聲蘇　　的進行曲，我仿彿體到我們前線的戰笳。在樓前　英軍的行列，看他們的軍運頻繁，我就想到我們前線忠勇戰士的忙碌活　。或干暮夜　見這風山七防探射燈的演習忙，看見黑暗中的　敵機袖電炬的追燭如妖魔之不遁形我則感到重分興奮，對於祖國的思念也就更深。</p>
<p>每當夜深人靜，浪　擊岸，悲的海風山風的交響中，於是我拿起來站在國前，對着慈祥的天容，對着解人的繁　，對着靜　的羣山，對着莊嚴的海，虔誠地為我的祖國祝禱！</p>
<h3>稱心滿意</h3>
<p>— Fory　the著</p>
<p>我希望你快活，張伯倫先生，佛朗哥稱希特勒，　素　尼打成一伙兒。法四斯的大砲，是你拼命供供，的，此刻正在吉布羅陀操演着，同時，為了正義戎向你呼籲過的西班牙的吼聲，在占電馬的　旋的咆哮聲里低沉下去了。</p>
<p>你也快活，達拉第先生！把佛朗哥打軸心里折散開來是個夢想，你一定知道了</p>
<p>大衆快活罷，大英帝國的子孫們！對於一個忠勇無助的民族的死亡和毀誠用不着牽掛，佛朗哥可以用帝國的金錢收買過來的，好吧。我希望加尼　死亡的掙扎聲和巴塞隆那孩子的悲啼，沒有打擾了帝國人民恭敬的思慮。</p>
<p>你們滿意不？議員先生們！你們老是說西班牙是個共產主義的國家，活該得不着援助。</p>
<p>你們一定稱心的，孤立派先生們！你們穿上了中立法的外套——帮助侵略者，勒死民主力量。</p>
<p>再有，一切聰　而和善的先生們！你們以為西班牙戰爭不過是「一場兩個國家的　　」，此家庭間的口角總要好玩些，不錯，一百萬西班牙人為了你們而死亡，又一個法西斯的國家在歐洲誔生了。</p>
<p>鬼魂般尖厲的叫喊，你　得不？</p>
<p>這　為民主而犧牲，被空喊民主的人們所出　的民族的喊聲，佈綁住了他們的手，再去帮助他們的敵人，</p>
<p>這麽多孤兒　浪到世界的每個角落。</p>
<p>這麽多無辜的難民福波在法蘭西。</p>
<p>你聽得了西班牙人民悲慘的呼喊沒有？他們為民主而戰　　援而亡。</p>
<p>我希望：</p>
<p>浸有西班牙人在你傍邊，你絕不懼惜：</p>
<p>由隊們的帮忙而造成的西班牙怪物，萬稱心；</p>
<p>在未來民主和法西斯的鬥爭中，你們記起了西班牙！</p>
<p>你們永遠快樂吧！（包得譯）</p>
<h3>我的憶念</h3>
<p>— 于塞夫</p>
<p>我　揚子江。</p>
<p>童年，在揚子江的水流上，輪船載着我到　　泊。</p>
<p>父視的粗濁的聲音——</p>
<p>他在敎訓我，而且指着飛濺的浪花與戲的船苜。</p>
<p>他說：『要這樣地不活啊！』一</p>
<p>楊子江上的浪花是多麽潔白。兩岸的　綠的樹叢，山脈，潮濕的村了…</p>
<p>但是，父親的舊老的臉孔上的皺紋，有些海恨的影子，他已不復是年靑力壯者了，他的精神祇有往着苦癢的深淵中下。</p>
<p>輪船的機器無休止地喧嚷著，整日整夜地，我們的揚子江是在不安中了。</p>
<p>去年，我們在揚子江畔，看見×人的兵艦，吐着濃黑的血腥的烟，那麽無顧忌地駛行。</p>
<p>去年，我們在揚子江畔，看見×人的兵艦，被我們的飛機炸沉了　那是在星夜裏的壯舉呵。</p>
<p>我們聽到兵艦上的嘈雜的聲音，我們看到兵艦，冐著烟……</p>
<p>去年我在揚子江畔，己不復是空着手？我們的手裏啊，緊握着武器。</p>
<p>年老的父親呢？他那粗　的聲音：</p>
<p>「要這稱地生活啊！」</p>
<p>這聲音，經過了寂寞的村落，到夜間，揚子江的浪潮吼出一種激憤的聲音。</p>
<p>「為　麽它要這稱　不安哪？」一個幼年的同志問我</p>
<p>望着天邊的乳白色的月。我說：</p>
<p>「它並不是不安，它要起來反抗，像我們一樣……因為他是中國的，」</p>
<p>我們再也沒有接續上去。</p>
<p>年老的　親不　我漂泊了，他呢？他的消息，我不知，他會安心的，因為找民民懂得「這樣地生活」。</p>
<p>飛機的浪花與鐵的船員……</p>
<p>怎麼能忘計啊。我們的美麗的揚子江，如今是遭受着×人的蹂躪。</p>
<h3>歸鄕途中（上）</h3>
<p>— 王里</p>
<p>握成了親愛的同志，親愛的弟兄，我一個人換上了便服，帶着了興奮的心，走上從游擊區到被佔區的路。</p>
<p>背上了一隻小包袱，我在鄕村田野裏默默地走着，在我的　面，早晨的太陽投射出耀眼光芒。</p>
<p>在太陽出來的遼遠的那邊，有書我已淪陷　鄉，有着我的父親和弟弟。極目力的瞧着地平綫的那邊，一顆久久痛苦着我的心，似被一隻有力的巨手緊緊握住了，我的脚步，在夜露未乾的路上加速了起來。</p>
<p>故鄕！父親！弟弟！</p>
<p>在一瞬眼中，我已與他們分別人一年餘！在分離的一年餘中，我們是斷絕了音訊。</p>
<p>——在這一年餘中，淪陷的故鄉是否無恙，作這一年餘中，父親與弟弟，是　標生活着的呢了</p>
<p>久縈於心的這思念，現在又急切的勾起來。</p>
<p>紛亂的思緒支配著整個的頭腦。兩隻腿了像被別人支使著地走着。一塊石子絆了我的脚，才　醒了我的頭腦。</p>
<p>我回頭向背後，看那有着我的同志，兄弟，祖國英勇的兒女們的那邊，我與起着無限的惜別。我又瞧着在碧空之前的茅山三峯，三峯之頂，　薄的輕雲浮動一。</p>
<p>——茅山！再會吧！再會吧！　山——我自語着，向它默默的點了點頭。</p>
<p>於是找又面回着耀眼的太陽那運，誇起大步走着。</p>
<p>在傍晚的時分，我到達一個鄉村，於是在一個農民的家裏，息下了疲乏的足，惜宿了一夜。</p>
<p>早晨，我背起了小包袱，繼續了我的行程，可是達到離公路三分之一里的時候，前面忽然傳來了幾響檢聲，於是不能不停止了脚步，接着，步槍與機關槍　，繼總環了起來。　（未完）</p>
<h3>告舊嗜好的文學青年</h3>
<p>— 尙卿</p>
<p>早就有人說過，中國在現代世界，雖然科學不如人，以致物質文明落在人後，而哲學和文學，却有着獨特的長處，使精神文明超出了世界各國。因此一祖國粹學者，死活抱着許多綫裝的斷簡殘篇，不肯放　，以為是枕中秘寳，自己欣賞之，研究之，倣作之不已，還要拼命宣傳，叫後生小子，也走他們的一路，人人來欣賞，來研究，來倣作，大部份的中學國文敎師，旣不免於這樣，而所有的大學國文敎授就差不多全是這樣了，我們仔細想想看，這究竟對麽？</p>
<p>我們的哲學和文學是否超出世界各國，這個問題太大了，現在來不及講，卽使說，我們的哲學和文學，是有獨特的長處的，所有的讀書靑年，是否都應該人人去欣賞，去研究，去倣作呢？我想凡是知道一個國家，尤其是我們現在的國家，需要着什麽的人，總也不會說應該吧。固然對於這種哲學和文學有特長在特嗜的靑年，也許可以去欣賞，去研究，去倣作，然而决不是個個人所應該的。</p>
<p>現在，我們還是來不及談哲學，就談文學吧。我止看見了許多有這種嗜好的文學靑年，他們喜歡寫文言文，拿加不通，愈加要寫，目的並非在學習，而在出風頭，表示自己有學問，等到寫通了，還是不擇時，不擇地，不管有無需要地寫。他們喜歡吟詩，七言五言，仄仄平平。不問究竟吟得好不好，只是自命風雅。他們又喜歡口頭掉文，然而然則。之乎者也，不管得當不得當，每句　裏總要夾幾個，表示他們是道地的文人。甚焉者，他們依然不脫才子佳人的念頭，寫着妃靑　白的情書，言情小說，或者滿紙堆砌着浮詞的體體詩詞，在學校裏讀醫抱貓虎主義，在社會上作事取數衍態度，在家裏過日子，則以不事家人生產，而自鳴淸高。誰要是說他不該如此，誰就會遭他的白眼，被斥為俗物。恤假使是有家當的，一定敗光，假使本來沒有家當的，則一定弄得左支右絀，狼狠不堪。然而他不悔，並且也不改，逗要以君子固窮，『詩人窮而後工』來自為解嘲。……</p>
<p>這樣的青年，我看了這有些痛心，所以我想用我誠懇的心願，吿訴他們幾句話：</p>
<p>在現在這個時代，尤其現在的中國。最好你不要嗜好文學，因為文學並不是最繁的需要品，尤其不要嗜好當文學，因為文學裏所有的大都只是：喪氣話：頺廢話空想，幻念，無聊的極忠，裝腔作勢，無病呻吟……，這是鴉片，酒精，任何害人的　醉劑。</p>
<p>如果　對於這種電文學已經知道其害處，不過一時戒不掉，丟个下，那末我歡你，你就以欣賞為止，有閒　的時候，就以此為消　，欣賞一下。切不要進而求之，從事研究，你如果有研究的精神，我願家多研究與現代，尤其與我們的國家，有實際用處的學問，不要砌究這種舊文學。</p>
<p>再退一步說，如果你對於這樣舊文學，非但確有嗜好，而且確有特長，你非從事研究不可。那宋，你就去研究；研究出一個頭緒來，研究一些實用的成績來，未嘗不好，然而你却切切不可從事倣作。因為倣作得像，也不過是假古董，不像，更是笑話，而倣作又十之八九是不像的，又何必勞而無功，多此一舉呢。</p>
<p>最後一步，如果你已經　於倣作這種舊文學了，我還要國你以少倣作為妙。這種東西根本沒有用處，眞正只好覆瓿，而旦還不免應人壞影響。你史不司因為善於倣作這種東西，而擺出一些舊式文人所常有的名士氣派來。名士，在以前便已被妓女駡邇傾幾文錢一斤，在現在，恐怕非但一文不迪，人家看見了你那般酸氣，就要掩鼻而過之吧！如果你的文字技術已很有把握，還是多寫一些切台時代新體創作。</p>
<p>我這樣的說，的確是殺夙景的，也許正有人要駡我，不懂舊文學，所以有此皮相之談，來侮學舊文學。我不要聲辯，我情願受這樣的罵。不過我的確是心所謂危，不得不言。我不願看好好的靑年，却坐上倒車，開到幾千年幾白年前去，葬送了一生，誤盡國家大事。我希望他們每一個人都能够走上玥代的大道！</p>
<p>同時，我也希望大部份的中學國文教師和差不多全體的大學國文敎授。都不會過份提倡這種舊文學，肯將欣賞，研究，與倣作，辨別得淸消楚楚，卽有所提倡，還是以於巳於國都有實用為目的。</p>

<h3>Japan's New Difficulties and New Strategies</h3>
<p>The Japanese ××ist policy is to destroy China and dominate East Asia. This is the fundamental policy of Japan ×, and it cannot be changed and will never be changed until the total collapse of Japanese ××ism. However, in order to adapt to the needs of each specific period or specific environment, they can adopt a special strategy, that is, special methods and special tricks. The new strategy of Japan × that we are talking about refers to the new methods and new tricks that Japan × has formulated to solve its current new difficulties. The ultimate goal of this new strategy is, of course, to destroy China and dominate East Asia.</p>
<p>What new difficulties is Japan × encountering at present? We all know that half a year ago, Japan × originally wanted to subdue us and defeat us by occupying Guangzhou and Wuhan. However, the result was not only that we did not submit and admit defeat, but on the contrary, the arrogant Japanese × authorities had to admit that the war had entered a new stage. They had to admit that the Sino-Japanese War had only begun after the occupation of Guangzhou and Wuhan. They even had to utter the lament of preparing to wage a century-long war with China! They have completely lost the courage of "conquering China in three months" at the beginning of the war! After half a year of fighting, the only gain of Japan × is the occupation of Nanchang City, while what they have lost, in terms of casualties alone, has increased from 600,000 or 700,000 to 800,000 or 900,000! Now Chinese, international people, and the Japanese themselves have clearly seen that China has laid the foundation for a long-term resistance and final victory. The attempt of Japan × to fight a quick battle has been shattered. China's crises and difficulties are decreasing day by day, while Japan's crises and difficulties are increasing day by day. At present, Japan's × difficulties are: military shortages, dangerous transportation, unfavorable terrain, difficult deployment, and empty rear; economically, poverty and declining production, declining foreign trade, and the collapse of the national economy; politically, the rising anti-war sentiment at home, the contradiction between export-oriented light industry and military heavy industry, the contradiction between warlords, financial groups, small and medium-sized property owners, and the broad masses of the people, and the conflicting contradictions of various policies of the ruling class (such as the recent conflict of joining the German-Italian military alliance). All of this is increasingly exposing the development of all the difficulties of Japanese ×× in its barbaric and regressive war, and is becoming increasingly insurmountable.</p>
<p>Japan × certainly will not fail to find ways to overcome these increasingly serious difficulties. Japan × certainly also knows that it is impossible to overcome these increasingly serious difficulties by relying only on Japan itself and its colonies of Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, the focus of their overcoming difficulties is not placed in their own country, but in the territory of China that has been occupied, and among the people under their rule. That is, they know that comparing their land, manpower, and production with ours will not overcome the increasingly progressive difficulties. Therefore, they attempt to add China's land, population, and production to their side in order to solve their increasingly serious crises and difficulties. This is the basic principle of Japan's × new strategy for solving new difficulties.</p>
<p>In order to implement this new strategy, the main feature manifested in concrete facts is that it will change from being mainly military to mainly political offensives. This does not mean that it will stop military offensives, nor does it mean that it will abandon military offensives, but mainly take political offensives as the main focus and military offensives to cooperate. That is, it attempts to rely on political forces to cooperate with military actions to rule China in the occupied areas, invade China that has not been occupied by it, and achieve its goal of annexing the whole of China and dominating East Asia. All the recent speeches and actions of Japan × traitors, such as establishing a new order in East Asia, adding the establishment of a collaborative political system of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, such as expanding the propaganda of "anti-communism," "anti-Chiang," and "negotiating peace," such as expanding the anti-base movement in the occupied areas; such as intensifying the robbery of concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin, and forcibly landing in Gulangyu, such as attacking British and French mail ships in the waters near Hong Kong, such as launching so-called large-scale encirclement and annihilation battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan and large-scale bombing of Chongqing and Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Shantou, such as doubling the funding and instigating Wang Jingwei to carry out "anti-communism" and "peace" propaganda to organize puppet central agencies, etc. All of this has only one central goal, which is to take the east of China, North China, Central China, and South China, that is, the entire area east of the Yellow River, east of the Pinghan and Yuehan railways, that is, the vast eastern area of China with the largest population, the most fertile land, and the richest products, and completely annex it to the rule of Japan × by political methods and military actions, in order to intensify the robbery and oppression, solve its current crises and difficulties, and further realize the conquest of the whole of China and the domination of East Asia!</p>
<p>Today, we must be especially vigilant about Japan's × conspiracy to absorb China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and use China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to fight against China and conquer China! Today, we must be especially vigilant about the speeches and actions of Wang Jingwei and others who are desperately advocating opposition to the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, slandering the central government, insulting × after the battle, and all the speeches and actions that provoke and alienate our internal unity and break our determination to resist for a long time, and all the speeches and actions that use all methods to destroy our spiritual mobilization, material mobilization, and political, military, economic, and diplomatic progress. All of this will help Japan × solve its new difficulties and realize its new strategies, and increase the difficulties of our resistance and nation-building, and increase the threat to democracy and peace in East Asia and even the whole world!</p>
<p>From here, it can already be clear the importance of our current development of all the battles behind the × people in the occupied areas, the importance of our current intensified attack on anti-communist and peace speeches, and the attack on all traitors, puppets, and Wang and other active puppet central party and government agencies, and we should understand more clearly the importance of intensifying national unity, intensifying people's mobilization, and intensifying the promotion of political progress today!</p>
<h3>The New Status of Chinese Youth in Wartime</h3>
<p>— Speech by Feng Wenbin, Special Correspondent for Airmail from Xi'an</p>
<p>In these nineteen months, there have been tremendous historical changes in both the international and domestic situations. Nineteen months ago, we had just entered a period of domestic peace, and resistance was still a subject of debate among some people. Some people still doubted whether China could resist Japan, whether it could carry out a comprehensive and sustained resistance. But now, the resistance has been going on for more than a year, and all our youth, under the call and leadership of Chairman Chiang, have been in a state of war.</p>
<p>The changes that have taken place in China in these nineteen months have indeed exceeded the past decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years. The great national self-defense war of the Chinese nation, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, is completely unprecedented in China. The Chinese nation, which has experienced serious internal divisions, is now united for the first time regardless of party affiliation, class, or ethnicity. The Chinese nation, which has long been oppressed by imperialism, has raised its head and straightened its chest for the first time! All the changes, such as the unification and progress of the regime and the army, the increasing development of democratic politics, and the increasing activity of the mass movement, are all what we have seen with our own eyes and experienced personally. They have given our nation a completely new look. Everything in the Chinese nation is progressing, changing, and strengthening itself. All the corrupt, reactionary forces that violate the resistance, all the Huang Juns, Wang Gongdus, Zhang Mutaos, and even Li Fuyings and Han Fuqus (and even Wang Jingwei), are being eliminated day by day with the development of the war; the sprouts of the Three People's Principles of New China are growing day by day.</p>
<p>However, among all the changes, the most decisive one is still the resistance. Resistance is not only the driving force of our various progress, but also the only major event that determines our survival.</p>
<p>Resistance determines the fate of our nation and the fate of all our youth. The situation of the Chinese youth movement today is completely different from that of nineteen months ago. The youth of the whole of China today are in an extraordinary period, an unprecedented period in history.</p>
<p>Today, no matter who the Chinese youth is, no matter when or where, their lives are not affected and dominated by the war. The war has fundamentally changed our living conditions, and therefore the war has become the central issue of the Chinese youth movement today. The invasion of Japanese imperialism has first brought us unprecedented disasters.</p>
<p>Many of our prosperous cities have fallen, most of the factories have closed, and tens of thousands of laboring youth and professional youth have had to wander around hungry. Famous schools such as Nankai, Tongji, Jinan, Jiaotong, Fudan, Daxia, Guanghua, Central, Huazhong, Huda, Xiamen, Zhongshan, and Lingnan have all been subjected to fierce bombing. Schools have been constantly shrinking, merging, and moving. At least four-fifths of the students have been unable to continue their studies.</p>
<p>Some of the land in the countryside has been completely occupied by × people or Koreans and Taiwanese directed by × people. Some land has been prohibited from cultivation by × people. Even if crops are planted, they are forced to be destroyed, or they cannot be harvested when it comes time to harvest. Wherever × people pass, houses, livestock, and farm tools are all destroyed. Even if they escape back, life is difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Why do our countless millions of compatriots lose their schooling and jobs and live in hunger and cold? Why do they wander on the road and have no home to return to? Why can't they see their fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters? This is the result of the invasion of Japanese imperialism. Who has taken away our happiness, who has taken away our land, fields, houses, property, and shattered our original hopes? This is the Japanese fascist ×× military clique.</p>
<p>When we think of how the Japanese warlords directly slaughtered and devastated us, we cannot help but feel our blood boiling. We don't know how many tens of thousands of old parents and handsome young people have been killed! 80,000 compatriots in Nanjing were slaughtered, and 20,000 were raped. In Guangdong Province alone, before June 7 of the 27th year, there were more than 1,400 bombings. The number of × aircraft that came successively reached a total of 5,987, dropping 12,769 bombs. 4,595 compatriots were killed and 8,555 were injured. How can we forget this blood debt!</p>
<p>We cannot forget that many young people in the Northeast and North China were forced to take up guns for the × people to kill their own compatriots. Last March, more than 1,000 young peasants in northern Shanxi were escorted by × people from Shuoxian to Datong. In order to prevent them from defecting, the × people actually gave them</p>
<p>One by one, they were given dumb needles. How many angel-like adorable children were captured to be slaves, transfused blood for the × people to death. Last spring, more than 300 women and children in Puxian County, Shandong, sought refuge in a Catholic church. ×××××××××××××. Finally, when the × people withdrew, they set fire to the Catholic church, and all the women and children who took refuge were burned to death inside. Around the same time. × people estimated that there were more than 500 children in Ningwu and Yangquan, Shanxi.</p>
<p>We cannot forget that our beloved youth leaders Cao Chengxian, Chen Zhutian, and Sun Shishi were bombed to death by × people. We cannot forget the brave Shi Wei, who led peasant guerrilla warfare in Guantao, Shandong, and was captured by × people and tied to a galloping horse to be dragged to death alive.</p>
<p>Here, we want to tell the world on behalf of the youth of the whole country that we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will never forget to avenge our victims; we will never coexist with Japanese imperialism, even if we shed the last drop of blood, we will overthrow Japanese imperialism! (The whole audience shouted: Down with Japanese imperialism!)</p>
<p>The invasion of Japanese imperialism has forced us to rise up to avenge and defend ourselves, to defend our motherland, to defend world peace. In order to liberate our compatriots and ourselves, a large number of young people, like a tide from all corners, have set their sights on the battlefield of resistance, the forefront of resistance.</p>
<p>Youths in the middle of the resistance showed the courage of a person, as if they were born to eliminate × people. Youth generals are generally loved, and youth soldiers are often the China of all elite troops. The glorious, tragic, and moving history they have left for the cause of national liberation of the Chinese nation is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Yao Ziqing, the battalion commander who defended Baoshan to the death, and the entire battalion he led, and the eight hundred warriors who defended the Shanghai Sihang Warehouse under the leadership of Xie Jinyuan, the deputy regimental commander, were almost all young people. Ye Chenghuan, the regimental commander who fought hard to defeat the X army's Komeji Brigade and died for the country, was only twenty-five years old, and Chen Erlian, the leader who burned down twenty-four X army planes at Yangmingbao, was only twenty-three years old. We can introduce to you Comrade Kuang Chaode, a representative sitting here, who is one of the young representatives of the × Route Army. He has fought nine battles and fought hand-to-hand with × people three times. Once, he killed three × people alone, but he is only eighteen years old this year. (Applause)</p>
<p>The Chinese Air Force can be said to be a truly young air force. Yue Haiwen, the martyr who was killed heroically in the Shanghai air battle because his plane landed in the X area and killed dozens of X people. Li Guidan, the martyr who shot down more than ten X planes in the Wuhan air battle and died for the country, Shen Chonghai, the martyr who was good at destroying X planes and X ships with flesh bombs and died together, and Chen Huaimin, these national heroes who will be remembered forever, are all around twenty years old. (Applause)</p>
<p>Youths are even more active in the Chehua War. The youth camp led by General Yang Jingyu in the Northeast, the Pingjin Student Guerrilla Team led by Professor Yang Xiulin active in the Taihang Mountains, and the teachers and students guerrilla team of Taiyuan Chengcheng Middle School active in Guanlingshan and Daqingshan, established anti-Japanese base areas behind the X. The Tongpu Road Workers' Self-Defense Force, the Pinghan Road Ironworkers' Destruction Brigade, held uprisings and established the Tangshan Seven Thousand Miners of the Jidong Anti-Japanese Base Heap, either all youths or with youths as the backbone. There is a story that can illustrate the wisdom and bravery of youths in guerrilla warfare. A young bugler, after winning a small victory in a night raid on Linfen Station, secretly ran to the top of Linfen City with only a trumpet, a broken gun, and nine hand grenades and blew the assembly call. The × people gathered under the city, and he used hand grenades and guns to kill eighty or ninety × people. Then he himself made a glorious sacrifice. This unnamed youth is truly a good example of the new Chinese youth (applause).</p>
<p>Our youth not only bravely directly participate in the battle, but also bravely carry out various services to assist in the work of the war. Yang Huimin, a female soldier in Shanghai, risked sending telephone machines and national flags to the isolated army in the Sihang Warehouse. The children of the Hankou New Life Service Corps shined shoes and donated money. Many young rescuers, journalists, and railway workers entered and exited the battlefield under the gunfire, working hard, even sacrificing their own lives. The salvation song and drama work and the work of standing guard, guarding, and catching traitors by young people and children in various heap directions have achieved great results. Zhou Deyou, a banker's son of eighteen years old in the Reclamation Drama Troupe, died of overwork because he devoted himself to the work of salvation. The students of Linfen National Revolutionary University captured the famous traitor Zhang Mutao. Wang Zun, the daughter of the traitor leader Wang Kemin, advised her father not to listen, and resolutely declared that she would sever her father-daughter relationship with him, and would rather go to work in a factory in Hong Kong to maintain her own life.</p>
<p>All this shows the infinite courage of Chinese youth. It also proves that the Chinese youth are the pillar of the resistance and nation-building, the new force of the country, and the pioneer of national liberation.</p>
<p>The resistance has trained our youth, so that we simply don't know what it means to be hardship. The spirit of hard struggle shown by our youth has made many elders not only change their views on our youth, but also greatly strengthened their belief in the future of the Chinese nation and their belief that resistance will win and nation-building will succeed.</p>
<p>Many young people, because they want to study the theory of resistance, have left their families and ran to the schools that train resistance cadres, "not afraid of the thousands of mountains and rivers." Their original lives are often very good and very wealthy, but life in these schools is very hard. Often there are no classrooms, lack of desks, chairs, candles, books, and medicines, sleeping very crowdedly, wearing and eating very roughly, and even having to take time out to build the cave dwellings they live in, grow food and vegetables, and participate in the work of the kitchen, carrying water, and cooking. But they still do not want to give up a minute of their time, and study very nervously and very happily. Even though it snows and freezes, they still get up very early to wash their faces with cold water, run and climb mountains against the north wind, and sing loudly.</p>
<p>They often do not count the merits, fame, and wealth in various services, and always bury themselves in hard work with a spirit of perseverance and a will of never giving up. No matter how bad the environment is, they rarely have the bad habits of prostitution, gambling, corruption, flattery, and bullying. No matter how dangerous the work is, they rarely hesitate.</p>
<p>Why can we do this? Besides for the liberation of the motherland, besides for the resistance, can there be any other reason?</p>
<p>The resistance itself is the best school. The resistance has educated our youth, so that we can re-understand ourselves and the era we are in. Our thoughts are rapidly progressing, so that we are no longer pessimistic and doubtful, and do not only care about the enjoyment of one person at one time and take aloofness from politics as noble. The resistance has further educated us that only by mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and relying on the masses can we defeat all × people and overcome all difficulties. The majority of the youth of our generation are willing to give everything to the motherland, and are wholeheartedly committed to realizing an independent, free, and happy Three People's Principles Republic. For the cause of the Chinese people, we are willing to fight to the end and sacrifice everything. We are eagerly pursuing social science and progressive theories in the world, and we love truth more than our own lives.</p>
<p>The resistance educates us, so that we have a great vision and a calm mind. We see that the victory of the resistance requires long-term patient struggle. Our selfless mind is matched with the hard work of compromising, and even those young people with deep-seated prejudices cannot help but be moved.</p>
<p>In June this year, a classmate from the Anwu Fort Youth Training Class went to a guerrilla team in western Shanxi to work as a squad leader. The captain of this guerrilla team was an stubborn and old-fashioned person. At the memorial meeting for the "July 7th" Resistance and Nation Building, he gave a speech saying: "Today is our national humiliation memorial day," which made some of the soldiers laugh. The captain put the people who laughed in confinement. Once again, a soldier sang the March of the Volunteers, and the captain said: "Why sing if there is no order?" and also put him in confinement. The captain's oppression was very terrible, and he even lost his temper for no reason and kicked the soldier's body with his feet. This kind of thing caused great dissatisfaction among everyone. But this youth always tried to persuade everyone and eliminate everyone's alienation from the captain.</p>
<p>But later, some of the members of his squad, because they couldn't bear the captain's tyranny, actually ran away, and were afraid that their beloved squad leader would be severely punished, so they left their guns behind. When the captain found out, he insisted on shooting this squad leader, which caused many officers and the county magistrate to intercede. As a result, this squad leader was pulled by the captain and beaten forty big boards. His hands were swollen red; he forgot to salute when he walked away, so he was pulled back and beaten four more big boards.</p>
<p>Even so, he still sees the resistance as higher than everything else and is not discouraged by this at all. He not only continues to work actively as usual, but also continues to encourage everyone to work hard and rest assured. No matter what, it is necessary to maintain the unity of the troops up and down. Until later, this youth, in voluntarily taking on the most arduous task, went to Taiyuan City to reconnaissance the X situation, and was unfortunately arrested and sacrificed. What a great spirit the Chinese youth has shown here!</p>
<p>There are also several young people working in a theater troupe in an army in North China. The officers despised them and were jealous of them. Intentionally making things difficult for them. Once they asked this theater troupe to perform a play the next day, and they had to perform well. The young people in the theater troupe immediately wrote and rehearsed the play all night, and the next day they performed it as expected, and it made the officers very impressed. The officers gradually understood that they only had a single-minded loyalty to devote themselves to the resistance, and they climbed the mountain every morning after washing their faces with cold water. The oldest secretary-general, who originally opposed them the most, also joined their climbing team and also canceled the guard. Once he said to them: "Your patriotic spirit is really good, the future of China is all in your generation of youth!" As he spoke, tears fell.</p>
<p>In the resistance, our youth's social status is improving day by day. In the past, many people in society looked down on young people, thinking that young people were useless and only had five minutes of enthusiasm. When they saw young people, they all said, what can children do? Now this kind of mentality is gradually being broken. There are many county magistrates in some war zones who are young people, because they are serious in their work, have noble personalities, and only know how to go down to the countryside to work and do not know how to be promoted and make money. The people all love them and call them anti-Japanese county magistrates. The more the resistance develops, the more the government and the people need young people, and the more important the status of young people becomes.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said: "Youths are the vanguard of the revolution and the new life of the country. All social evolution and political reform depend on the impetus of youths to be their main force... Always remember that the Chinese revolution is a long and arduous undertaking. I love the youth who are rich in revolutionary spirit and continue the revolutionary cause as if they were the most precious treasure; in other words, Zhongzheng really sees our youth as my life. There must be countless revolutionary youths who combine to form a great force, advancing wave upon wave, never giving up, and then can they vigorously implement the doctrine, defend the country, and revive the nation, so as to achieve the ultimate goal of the national revolution."</p>
<p>Our youth, today is already the pillar of the national nation, we must bear a very arduous and noble responsibility. The times not only want us to bear the task of resistance, but also want us to bear the task of revitalizing the country and building the country. The key to the Three People's Principles of New China is in our hands. Our every move is related to the future of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Chinese youth today not only have a great role and a high status in China, but also have a great role and a high status in the world.</p>
<p>Eden of England said: "The Chinese resistance saved European democracy."</p>
<p>The American Student Federation wrote to the Chinese Student Federation: "Frankly speaking, our lives and safety also depend on the weapons you are shouldering."</p>
<p>The youth of all countries now sympathize with us, respect us, and constantly use various methods to help, encourage, and comfort us. Our international friends, the World Student Federation, sent a delegation to China to see us. We are warmly welcomed wherever we go in Europe and the United States. They all praised the Chinese youth as heroic and said that the Chinese youth are the model for the youth of the world.</p>
<h3>Notice to All Friends Who Sympathize with the Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Song Qingling</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, I sincerely offer a brief introduction to all friends who sympathize with the resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>In the current war, Japan not only destroys our families but also, in order to force our people to become completely agricultural slaves, it especially uses all means to destroy our modern industry. Seventy-five percent of our machine industry has already been destroyed or confiscated by them, and over a million workers have lost their jobs. We will never respond to this brutal act with despair. Even during such a war, our people and our government have already resolved to restore our productivity, both old and new, in various inland areas. Even along the railways occupied by the Japanese, we are building thousands of small-scale factories. Because we want to involve the vast majority of the people, to make their sacrifices worthwhile, and to make this construction democratic, these factories are being built in a cooperative manner. Through these cooperatives, we hope to absorb refugees, turning the millions of relief funds spent on refugee camps in Japanese-occupied areas from wasteful charity into productive capital. Currently, in these areas, impoverished refugees are merely being kept alive there, waiting for the Japanese to be ready to exploit them at any time. Industrial cooperatives can maintain the stability of inland markets, so that even if the Japanese occupy all the cities, the disruption of the rural economy can be avoided. Industrial cooperatives can resettle unemployed workers, supply the army with clothing and provisions, prevent famine, and alleviate other difficulties that may arise from economic disruption, supporting the long-term resistance against Japan, so that Japan gains no benefit from occupying our cities. This movement needs the help of righteous and progressive people everywhere. Relief organizations should donate the relief supplies originally intended for Japanese-occupied areas to these cooperatives, and industrial manufacturers should provide credit for the purchase of machinery and raw materials to these industrial cooperatives. By supporting this permanent production, relief efforts can also rebuild their own future markets. Patriotic bankers should provide loans, and trained young people should join and serve as technicians. Our government and people wholeheartedly welcome all support for this emerging movement!</p>

<h3>We Maintain Superiority on All Battlefields; Fierce Battle in Central Hubei for a Week Eliminates Two Thousand Enemies; Our Air Force Flies to Southern Jiangxi to Bomb Enemy Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] In the current situation on all battlefields, we are in an advantageous position. The enemy in southern Henan and central Hubei are clustered in the areas of Zhe River, Anlu, Dahong Mountain, Yingcheng, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang, putting up a last-ditch struggle. In the fierce fighting over the past week, enemy casualties have continued to reach 2,000. Our guerrillas are active near Xinyang, constantly attacking the enemy. Localized fighting continues in southern and northern Hubei. Our forces are strong. Moreover, in Anhui Province, we recaptured Suzhou once again in mid-month, eliminating a considerable number of enemies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] Shaanxi News: In southwestern Shanxi, the enemy is still taking a defensive posture on the major transportation lines. Areas outside the transportation lines are all in our hands. The southern section of the Tongpu Railway and the area near Zhongtiao Mountain are completely under our control. Although the enemy has reinforced Fengling and is attempting to cross the river by force under the cover of artillery fire, our defending soldiers are constantly retaliating against the enemy, killing many. The river defense is secure.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] According to reports, the enemy in various occupied areas of North China are demoralized, and anti-war sentiment is high. The enemy does not dare to leave the cities in various places. The lives of our people in the countryside are as usual, and everyone believes that resistance against Japan will surely be victorious. Our guerrillas near Qingdao recently attacked Qingdao Island, briefly occupied Zhan Mountain, and killed a considerable number of enemies.</p>
<p>Southern Henan and Northern Hubei</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 25th] The 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions of the enemy, with Xiangfan as their main target of attack, attempted to annihilate our main force in the Sui-Zao area. They have all been routed and are no longer able to form an army. Among them, the 16th Division suffered the most severe losses. According to a certain high-ranking official returning from the front line who spoke to reporters, the enemy was forced to march 210 kilometers between the 14th, 15th, and 16th due to the movements of our troops. While our troops were attacking the enemy forces in the Tang River area, the enemy soldiers and horses were mostly exhausted on the way, allowing us to capture them. This time, the enemy attacked our northern Hubei, originally intending to encircle our army. Unexpectedly, the troops east of the Pinghan Railway suddenly crossed the railway. Our troops in western Hubei simultaneously advanced into northern Hubei. At the same time, our troops on the Xianghan and Jinghan roads launched attacks everywhere, creating a favorable situation of counter-encirclement. When the enemy was on the verge of collapse on the 19th, the self-defense forces of Zaoyang, Gucheng, and Yicheng counties immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy abandoned all their military blankets, uniforms, and telephones everywhere. Okamura, the top commander of the enemy in Central China, has been severely reprimanded by the enemy's supreme command for the failure of his command of the war. At the same time, the 16th Division, which suffered the heaviest defeat, has already been transferred to Wuhan. Currently, there are only over two thousand enemy troops in Zhongxiang. Our troops are still engaged in mixed warfare in Dahong Mountain. The enemy has been annihilated to the equivalent of a battalion or so. Our forces on the Xiangyi, Jinghan, and Zhonghan roads are even more powerful. The enemy reinforcements are holding their ground and dare not come out to fight. We hold an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 26th] Shashi Telegram: Since Zao Mountain was recaptured by us, Tianmen has been besieged by us, Jingshan has been pressed by us, and the enemy in Zhongxiang is generally fearful. In recent days, most of them have retreated towards Jingshan, seemingly trying to relieve the siege of Tianmen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 26th] Shashi Telegram: After Shashi County was recaptured by our army on the 22nd, the enemy trapped in Dahong Mountain has become fish in a cauldron, only trying to put up a last-ditch struggle. Now, they have again divided into three routes and are advancing towards our Xiaogan and Dahong Mountain, currently in a stalemate with us.</p>
<p>Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 25th] The enemy in northern Hunan launched a full-scale offensive against our positions on the north bank with all their might in the past two days. Our officers and soldiers fought back fiercely, killing or wounding over a thousand enemies. The lines have returned to stability.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 25th] Linqiao, southwest of Tongcheng, was originally garrisoned by two thousand enemy troops. After our continuous sweeps in recent days, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. There are no enemy traces in the area south of Chongyang and Linqiao.</p>

<h3>General Chen Cheng Discusses the War Situation: We Will Surely Expel the Japanese Army in Three to Five Years; The Enemy Faces Numerous Difficulties in the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 22nd, Air Dispatch] Foreign News: General Chen Cheng, who is currently commanding the battles in southern Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, is one of China's capable generals. This afternoon, the 22nd, he hosted a press conference here, stating:</p>
<p>"We do not expect to win this year or next, but if we continue to fight for three years, we will eventually achieve final victory."</p>
<p>Reviewing the war situation, the general said that Japan not only cannot make any further progress but is also trapped by the Chinese army in its occupied areas. In the area behind the Japanese army's lines, not counting the guerrillas and mobile forces, there are still as many as sixty divisions of the Chinese regular army.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in northern Hubei concentrated the forces of three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade, namely the 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions, in an attempt to encircle the Chinese army under the command of General Tang Enbo. However, after the battle north of Zaoyang, the Japanese army's encirclement plan has failed. Currently, Sun Lianzhong and Liu Ruming's troops are stationed in Xinye, and Liu Heding's regiment is stationed in Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army can no longer advance towards Xiangfan.</p>
<p>As for the Nanchang war zone under his command, the Japanese army's occupation of Nanchang is militarily advantageous to the Chinese army. Therefore, the Chinese army does not need to defend the areas south of the Xiu River, which allows the Chinese army to avoid attacks on multiple fronts. The Japanese army is currently engaged in defensive warfare in a vast area, and their strength has been greatly reduced due to the offensive against Nanchang. The Chinese army's counter-offensive towards Gaoan and Nanchang has prevented the Japanese army from achieving their goal of encircling the Chinese army north of Hubei and south of Hunan. Now, the enemy's strength has been greatly damaged, and the Chinese army is seizing the opportunity to strike back at multiple points. Therefore, the power of the counter-offensive is entirely in our hands. The Chinese army launched a counter-offensive towards Nanchang on April 22. Although it failed to recapture the city, several hundred soldiers briefly broke into the city. Unfortunately, they were unable to establish a foothold in the city. Furthermore, we have occupied several points on the railway between Nanchang and Jiujiang, which makes transportation very inconvenient for the Japanese army. Although the railway between Zhejiang and Jiangxi has been cut off, the Chinese army can still maintain transportation through the highways and coastlines further south. In addition, the Chinese army south and east of Nanchang is self-sufficient and has now been reorganized into mobile units.</p>
<p>The Japanese army currently has thirty infantry divisions and three cavalry brigades distributed in the following areas: three divisions in Guangdong and Hainan Island, two divisions in Shanghai, the railway zone, and southern Shandong, five divisions in southern Jiangxi, Hunan, and northern Hubei, three divisions in the Xiangfan area, and one cavalry brigade, two divisions in northern Anhui and the Pinghan Railway, four divisions in northern Jiangxi, the Jinpu and Shandong railway zone, three and a half divisions in Hebei and Chahar, two divisions in eastern Henan and the Jinpu Railway zone, five divisions in Shanxi Province, and two divisions in northern Shanxi and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>The worst period for China is now over. The general frankly admitted that China's most critical period was at the beginning of the July 7th Incident, when there were differing opinions in North China regarding the issue of war and peace, and again after the fall of the capital, when China suffered heavy losses in that battle. If the Japanese army had failed to inflict a decisive defeat on the Chinese army in the battles of Nanjing and Wuhan, such an opportunity would never come again. The general concluded, "China will surely achieve final victory. It is only a matter of time."</p>
<p>General Chen Cheng also stated that Japan is currently encountering four major problems in the occupied areas: a lack of time, labor, capital, and political and social stability. It is claimed that Japan's financial resources have been almost exhausted and that it is unable to develop the occupied areas. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and the United States' Four-Year Plan both require huge amounts of capital to be implemented. Japan currently lacks the resources, so Japan cannot exploit China's resources to conquer China. According to convention, it takes three to five years to profit from investing in the development of any land. It has been eight years since Japan invested in Manchuria, but it still cannot gain any benefits. Furthermore, if Japan wants to use China's resources to conquer China, it must first consider the "time" problem. Currently, there are very few Chinese laborers who are helping Japan. Chinese workers are unwilling to cooperate with Japan or help Japan exploit China's resources, so it is impossible to maintain political and social stability in the occupied areas.</p>

<h3>Japanese Navy Declares Interference; Foreign Ships Sailing Along Our Coast; All Foreign Ships Within Two Hundred Miles of the Coast Will Be Intercepted and Searched</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai Foreign News: A Japanese navy spokesperson stated that the navigation of third countries along the Chinese coast will now be completely blockaded. This is not a matter of rights but a requirement of the Japanese authorities. In other words, the Japanese have the right to order any ship in the Chinese coastal area to stop sailing and to check its registration certificate to determine whether it is being used for military purposes by the National Government. "Used for military purposes by the National Government" means whether the ship is carrying goods for the Chinese side's military use. As for the list of prohibited goods, it cannot be announced at this time, but this matter is being considered by the Japanese. Food and medicine may be listed as prohibited items.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai Foreign News: The Japanese spokesperson also stated that the Japanese blockade is limited to an area 200 miles from the coast. When a reporter asked what attitude the Japanese would take if the naval authorities of a third country sent warships to escort merchant ships, the spokesperson refused to answer, but said that the United States would probably not take such action. The spokesperson also said that navigation between Japanese-occupied areas and other parts of China will be completely prohibited, but he does not oppose peaceful trade within the occupied areas. However, the spokesperson refused to specify what kind of goods constituted "peaceful trade."</p>
<h3>British Authorities Take Seriously; Will Consult with the United States on Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th] British relations with Japan are becoming increasingly serious. At the same time, negotiations with the Soviet Union for an alliance are progressing extremely rapidly. It is now known that Foreign Secretary Halifax has notified the U.S. Ambassador to Britain of the details of the recent British-Soviet negotiations. The authorities here take the Japanese announcement of a blockade of the Chinese coast very seriously. It is claimed that the Japanese spokesperson did not acknowledge that a formal state of war legally exists between China and Japan, but his statement clearly amounts to a unilateral demand to enjoy the rights of a belligerent. However, before implementing retaliatory measures, Britain will temporarily wait for the situation to develop. Consultations will likely be held between London and Washington. According to experts, if Japan implements the blockade, Britain will adopt economic retaliation measures. The United States may ultimately invoke the Neutrality Act. Regarding some suggestions to have British warships escort British ships sailing along the Chinese coast, not only would the cost be too high, but Britain's warships in the Far East are also insufficient. This proposal is practically difficult to implement. Britain's economic retaliation against Japan will likely be implemented after an agreement is reached with the United States and joint action is taken.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Member of Parliament Henderson asked if the Japanese claim to blockade the Chinese coast, if implemented, would be in serious conflict with international law and whether the government would send warships to escort merchant ships in Chinese territorial waters to provide protection. Mr. Butler replied, "Since there are such rumors, further protection of British shipping is under urgent consideration." Mr. Butler also acknowledged that "this Japanese action is far from international law." Member of Parliament Feller asked, "Will the government take retaliatory measures, or will it only send ships for protection?" The reply was, "I do not wish to say anything further today, but I can assure you that the government takes this matter very seriously."</p>
<h3>Lanpura Wheel Intercepted for Investigation; Britain Protests to Japan; Colonel Norbert Doke and Others Go to Shanghai; The French Will Also Protest the Search of French Mail</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] British Ambassador to Japan Craig lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government's Foreign Ministry today over the detention of the well-known merchant ship Lanpura outside the Chinese coast by Japanese naval officers, an action that is highly likely to provoke resentment. Mr. Craig also raised concerns over the continued detention of the British ships Sangre and Larita. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson told a Reuters reporter that the detention of the Lanpura was purely a routine procedure because the Japanese navy wanted to verify the ship's nationality.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 26th] French Far East Naval Commander Vice Admiral Doke arrived here this morning aboard the flagship and immediately began investigating the Arimeth incident. At the same time, British Ambassador Sir Cole and U.S. Naval Commander Admiral Nobel have also decided to come here from Gulangyu aboard the Birmingham.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th] The Daily Mail reports that the recent aggressive actions of the Japanese have caused extreme concern among all countries concerned about the situation in the Far East, considering it extremely serious. The British naval authorities are considering a plan to send British ships to protect British merchant ships. The French government intends to follow Britain's example in protesting the Lanpura incident and lodge a strong protest with the Japanese over the boarding of the French ship Arimeth by Japanese troops within the territorial waters of Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Gulangyu; Four-Country Negotiations; On the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 26th] The Japanese-language Shanghai "Mainichi Shimbun" published a commentary today stating, "If the British side believes that the partial withdrawal of the Japanese navy from Gulangyu is a sign of weakness and intends to station its navy permanently in Gulangyu, then Japan may be forced to resort to force to resolve the issue."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to news from Xiamen, negotiations on the Gulangyu dispute will be resolved by diplomatic representatives from various countries. The second talk by naval personnel from the four countries (Britain, France, the United States, and Japan) will be the last. At the same time, the acting director of the Gulangyu Municipal Council has requested the Japanese consul to lift the ban on civil ship traffic, as this ban has stopped the transportation of daily necessities. It is reported that the foreign consular corps has suggested the establishment of a special zone to allow the transportation of materials into the zone, but it is reported that the Japanese side has refused.</p>
<h3>The United States Remains Silent; The State Department Awaits Reports</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Hull refused to comment on the news of the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast. He said that he has not yet received an official report on the matter and therefore cannot express an opinion.</p>
<h3>Record of Zhongshan Detai (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>A Pioneer of Anti-War Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zhongshan Detai, a staff officer of the Japanese 6th Division, walked from Echeng to a certain village on the border of Henan and Hubei and surrendered to us. Zhongshan is currently serving in the armies of Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>—— Reuters Dispatch ——</p>
<p>[Special Changsha Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper] With the consent of the staff department of the commander-in-chief of the first war zone, the reporter went to the headquarters of the special service battalion in the Chang Gongbu area near Changsha on the afternoon of May 15 to interview the anti-war Japanese cadet officer Zhongshan Taide. When the reporter was at Yang's headquarters near Xiushui, he heard that Zhongshan had jumped out of the cage of the invading army with great wisdom and courage, and he wanted to visit him once. Unfortunately, due to a day's discrepancy in the journey, he had already passed through Xiushui and taken the Tonggu route to Changsha. Unexpectedly, after only ten days, he was able to fulfill his long-cherished wish to meet him.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhongshan Taide lives in a school-style building, living with the brothers of the third company of the Shi Wu battalion. After the introduction of the third company commander, knowing that when the reporter walked up to the first floor, there was a short and stocky young man wearing a white homespun short shirt and pants, wearing slippers, walking slowly in the aisle. It turned out to be the person I wanted to interview.</p>
<p>We shook hands tightly. In the palms, there was a fusion of anti-aggression and anti-fascist fervor.</p>
<p>The reporter does not understand Japanese; Mr. Zhongshan does not understand English but can speak simple Chinese - this was one of the courses he studied in school in his country. He read out the name and occupation on my business card in Chinese, and after understanding that I had just returned from the front line in Xiushui, he said, "Hard work! Hard work!" as he reached out to invite me to sit in his bedroom on the third floor.</p>
<p>I first expressed my respect for his autonomous action in responding to the oppression of the Japanese warlords. Seeing that there was no mosquito net, I apologized for not being hospitable enough. He said, "It doesn't matter. The Chinese brothers don't have mosquito nets either." - That evening, I talked about it with Chen Zhen, the intelligence chief. He said that he had already bought them.</p>
<p>Then we began to communicate in writing.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhongshan Taide is from Osaka, Japan, and is twenty-four years old this year. He is a graduate of the Japanese Citizen's School and the Army Officer School's accelerated program. In his childhood, his family was poor, relying on selling newspapers (earning eight cents a day) to support the family, and he himself thus obtained the opportunity to study. It can be said that he has had a very profound feeling of dissatisfaction with Japanese society since he was a child. On June 28, Showa 13 (1938), he left his 48-year-old mother and 20-year-old wife in a lumber store in Osaka, and he himself was ordered to come to China, serving as a cadet officer in the Sixth Division headquarters, entering and exiting the battlefields on both sides of the Yangtze River. After the occupation of Wuhan, although it was once widely rumored that the "China Incident" was about to end, and the transportation authorities had even prepared to dispatch ships to send soldiers back to their countries, after the announcement by the Chairman Chiang, the Japanese soldiers' dreams of returning home were shattered, and he also continued to move with the army on the Guangdong-Hankou Road between Wuchang and Xianning. A year of expeditions made him recognize the truth about the war against China. He resolutely abandoned his promising career as a young military officer and joined the ranks of our country's sacred national revolutionary war.</p>
<p>Although he did not arrive in Changsha until early May, he had already left the Sixth Division headquarters stationed in Echeng as early as February 16. It was on that night that he sneaked out of the camp, walking south along the highway. In order to avoid the eyes and ears of the Japanese army, he only walked forty li by dawn and had to hide in the forest. At that time, he was still wearing a Japanese military uniform and carrying sixty Japanese yen, which he wanted to use to buy a set of Chinese farmers' clothing. The local people gave him a set of clothes he needed but returned the Japanese yen he paid. He knew that there were Chinese guerrillas near Liushikou Street, so he asked a fishing boat to take him there. After a day's journey by water, he arrived at his destination. The chief of the political department of the Xiang-E-Gan border area's civilian guerrilla headquarters - a student from Wuhan University - welcomed him and immediately arranged accommodation for him. A few days later, after passing through ×× Old Street and ×× Street, he met Yang Jun, the guerrilla battalion commander, in ××. He began to participate in the guerrillas there, staying for a month and a half. Battalion Commander Yang understood Japanese but could not speak it. They communicated in writing every day. Although life was difficult, they were very happy in spirit. It was at this time that he truly understood the greatness of the Chinese sons and daughters fighting for national liberation.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Again Suffers Air Raid; Heavy Casualties in Northern Guangdong; Harassment Occurs from Time to Time Along the Zhejiang and Fujian Coasts</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Japanese planes attacked Chongqing again last night, the 26th, at 7 PM. At that time, the new moon was high in the sky, and the clear sky was like a wash. The scene was clear, and the Japanese planes specifically targeted government offices and densely populated areas, dropping over 100 bombs. The disaster area, including Zhuo, the area affected on May 5th, and the commercial center of Chongqing, became a disaster area of one mile wide and one and a half miles long. All city telephone lines were cut, all telegraph poles were knocked down, and piles of rubble accumulated in the streets, with some reaching heights of over twenty feet.</p>
<p>When the Japanese planes intruded into the city's airspace, Chinese anti-aircraft guns roared in unison, forming a network of fire in the sky. Six Chinese fighter planes, despite the vast disparity in numbers, were not intimidated. They weaved through the fire net and the Japanese plane formations, attacking upwards and downwards, displaying extraordinary bravery. The Japanese planes incessantly dropped bombs densely along the riverbanks and in the area of Central Park, which is located on the edge of the city. One bomb hit the Chung Mei Bank, killing seven people standing at the entrance. The Lin Yeh Bank was shaken, and the tower of the Chongqing Bank was bombed off.</p>
<p>Six bombs landed near the Canadian Church's residential buildings, but the church and the YWCA dormitory were unharmed. One bomb hit a temple in the city center, and another destroyed the "Relief Association for Wounded Soldiers" run by foreigners. Numerous bombs fell around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The most tragic situation was in Central Park, where five bombs landed, resulting in hundreds of casualties. One bomb hit a shelter, killing twenty people. The tower-shaped shelter was destroyed, and the trees in the park were stained with blood. More than twenty people who sought refuge under a rock were killed by the violent shock and shrapnel. The German trading firm Kung Shih and the residence of the German Pi Tzu were destroyed. Bombs dropped by Japanese planes fell on small factories along the river, destroying boats, with corpses and body parts floating in the river. One bomb landed behind the Canadian Metropolitan Hospital, but there were no casualties. Several bombs also fell within the disaster area of May 5th, killing several soldiers defending the area. The total number of deaths and injuries in the city was estimated to be less than a thousand. An hour after the bombing, the entire city was enveloped in a dense, smoke-filled haze, suffocating and blinding those seeking refuge. Currently, there are two fires in the city that cannot be controlled.</p>
<p>A firecracker factory in the city was bombed, leading many citizens to believe that a military arsenal had been hit. This was quite amusing, as the explosion of firecrackers only allowed the police to enter the area half an hour later to rescue workers.</p>
<p>Currently, firefighters are finding it difficult to extinguish the fires in the city due to being blocked by rubble, but excavation teams are actively working to clear the obstacles. Hundreds of rescue workers have been dispatched to rescue the affected citizens.</p>
<p>The air is filled with the smell of gunpowder. According to sources, this is because the Japanese side is lacking cotton and is using old methods to manufacture bombs. The Chinese side claimed to have shot down two Japanese planes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 26th] According to reports from Chinese sources here, since the beginning of spring, Japanese planes have been carrying out massive bombings. Last night's disaster in Chongqing has reached the peak of air raids. In South China, sixty-six Japanese planes, divided into five groups, bombed various locations along the Yuehan Railway. In Yingde, thirty-three Japanese planes attacked, destroying hundreds of houses and causing heavy casualties. At the same time, twenty-three Japanese planes dropped twenty bombs in Wengyuan, destroying many houses and killing ten civilians. Also, ten Japanese planes dropped twenty-four bombs in Shaoguan, destroying twenty houses and killing twenty civilians. The Zhenhai Fortress near Ningbo was also subjected to an air raid, but the number of casualties is unknown.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 25th] At 5:05 AM on the 25th, five enemy planes invaded Zhenhai, dropping eleven bombs in the urban area, killing four people, injuring seven, and destroying ten houses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th] Three enemy planes flew north from the South Sea, and at 2:20 PM, dropped three bombs on Putian County, causing slight damage. The county, located 160 miles south of Yinzhou, encountered an air raid for the first time today.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Suffers Disdain; Requests to Visit Japan Three Times, Ignored; Desperate End as a Second-Rate Puppet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai report: Wang Jingwei is still living in the former residence of Jiang Zhongzheng in Shanghai. Wang has repeatedly expressed his desire to go to Tokyo to [Japanese]. However, [Japanese] does not value Wang and has not responded, so he has not been able to go. A few days ago, rumors in Shanghai spread that Wang had gone to Tokyo, which likely originated from this. It is now heard that Wang has requested to go to Japan for the third time, but how [Japanese] will respond is unknown. According to Wang's confidants, Wang knows that he is powerless and has expressed to [Japanese] that if Wu Peifu is willing to serve as a puppet, he is willing to assist Wu as a deputy, which shows his extreme desperation. Examining Wang's intention, he originally wanted to use his past political position, ××××, ×××××××××××××××, which is not only despised by the whole country, but [Japanese] also understands his empty promises and does not value him, so he has no conclusion and only highlights his ××. Now he lowers his head and begs to be a second-rate puppet. Even his confidants believe this kind of ×× behavior is hopeless and are unwilling to continue to be employed. Therefore, the activities of Wang's followers in Shanghai have been quieter recently than before.</p>

<h3>Britain Presents Draft Agreement to the Soviet Union; Issues Declaration Before Formal Signing; and Consults on Effective Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] The British Foreign Office has instructed its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to notify Soviet Foreign Minister of the outline of the tripartite mutual assistance agreement plan proposed by Britain, stating that the entire plan can be drafted soon. It is reported that the Soviet Union has accepted the British plan. Today, British defense ministers held lengthy talks with the foreign secretary regarding the tripartite agreement. It is said that the important elements of the tripartite military alliance have been included in the British proposal and will be submitted to the Soviet government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] How about the nature and scope of Britain's recent suggestions to the Soviet Union? The official single latitude is like a deep well. According to Reuters' diplomatic interviewer, the public believes that the suggestions contain the following key points. First, the suggestion contains a mutual assistance agreement, when any of the three countries (Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) directly attack the European territory of any country, the other two countries will assist. Before the formal agreement is established, the three countries will issue this declaration. Second, the suggestion also stipulates that when a country guaranteed by any of the three countries is directly attacked, the three countries should consult and act with each other. However, the country being guaranteed is still under discussion. Also, the country being invaded must rise up to resist before the guarantee can take effect. Third, the general staff of the three countries must hold consultations so that the navies, land forces, and air forces of the three countries can cooperate most effectively. The public believes that any agreement between the three countries must abide by the above three principles. Although these suggestions from Britain are not completely in line with the Soviet Union's proposal for a full defensive alliance, they have actually made provisions for any threat to the three countries from the outside world. At the same time, they do not pose any threat to countries that pursue peace and cooperation as their policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] Responsible figures recently announced that the draft mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been delivered by the British government to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has begun to be studied. It is expected that the governments of France and Britain will reach an agreement this evening, so that Foreign Minister Bonnet can hand over this draft to Soviet Ambassador Suritz before noon tomorrow. The British Foreign Office will then telegraph Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union (Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky is currently in Geneva). At that time, only details will need to be discussed, so the agreement is easy to conclude.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] The Friday News Record reported that, according to government sources, British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha will travel to Moscow in the near future, because the future Anglo-Soviet agreement contains conditions for military cooperation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] According to reports here, the French government has decided to follow Britain's example and send a military delegation to Moscow to discuss the military conditions of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] According to the Friday Standard Evening News, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Red Army has been invited to visit the British military exercises. It also said that the British Secretary of War, if the European political situation is favorable at that time, may travel to Moscow in September to respond to the Soviet Union and visit the Red Army exercises. It also said that after the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement is completed, the military staff conference of the three countries will be held next month.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] On Friday afternoon, the military officially announced that the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Red Army has accepted the British invitation to visit the British autumn exercises. It was said that senior officials from several countries will come to London for talks. According to informed sources, this refers to the chiefs of staff of France and Poland.</p>
<p>Germany Issues Announcement; Threatens Britain and France; Accuses "Encirclement Policy"; Britain Declares It Does Not Understand German Tone</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] Regarding the efforts of Britain and France to conclude an agreement with Soviet Russia, the German authorities today authorized a statement to the foreign press, stating that "collective countries will give a corresponding response to attempts at such encirclement tactics." The statement also said that these efforts by Britain and France are enough to increase the deterioration of the situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th] Semi-official sources recently issued a public announcement, stating that Britain is currently seeking to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that although Germany and Italy are willing to resolve various European issues in a friendly manner, they have been rejected by Britain and France. The day before yesterday, Italian government spokesperson Gayda published an article in the Italian Daily, also stating that Europe is currently at a crossroads. It is hoped that Britain and France will amend the Treaty of Versailles in a peaceful manner and not engage in encirclement. It must be known that Germany and Italy invited Britain and France to cooperate, which is the last time. Germany and Italy earnestly advised them, but Britain and France continued to promote the so-called effective new method, and were only engaged in continuing the encirclement policy. The situation is clear and cannot be denied. Furthermore, it is proven that Britain and France are unwilling to cooperate in seeking constructive solutions to maintain European peace, and it is also clear that they have no real intention of resolving the peace problem. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. The integrated countries will inevitably have to respond to this new attempt at encirclement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 25th] After the German semi-official announcement was issued, official sources here also made a statement, saying that the German announcement stated that the Axis powers invited the democratic countries to jointly resolve various European issues, which is the last word. British officials, after reading it, were baffled. It is noted that the obligations that the British government has accepted and should accept will only be implemented when the sovereign states concerned are threatened by aggression. According to the British government, it has always advocated using negotiations to seek solutions to various pending cases, and is still willing to cooperate in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>Huge Budget for the Next Year in the Soviet Union; Joint Session of the Two Houses Opens; Minister of Finance's Speech Crushes Aggression</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 26th] The Soviet Supreme Soviet (the two houses of the Nationalities and the Union) is the most prestigious organization in the European Parliament. It held its first meeting of the year in the Kremlin yesterday, with 1,200 people attending, representing more than 100 ethnic groups in the country. The deputies were mostly dressed in different national costumes, and the whole venue was colorful and dazzling. Stalin and the chairmen of the People's Committee arrived on time. The National Congress was formally opened, and Stalin would not participate in the discussions. The most important item on the agenda was the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Chairman of the People's Committee and Foreign Minister Molotov will attend the meeting to deliver a speech, and then the deputies will hold a debate on the international situation. When Molotov delivers his speech, he will explain the reasons for the resignation of former Foreign Minister Litvinov. In addition, the national defense issue and the Five-Year Plan are also on the agenda for debate. This meeting will last for a week or ten days before adjourning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] At today's meeting of the two houses of the Soviet Union, Finance Minister Zverev reported that the Soviet Union's total military expenditure budget for 1939 was 40,885,000,000 rubles, compared to 27,000,000,000 rubles last year. This figure accounts for more than 25% of the national budget. The representatives cheered and applauded for five minutes. When Zverev spoke, Stalin, Voroshilov, and other government officials listened attentively. Zverev also said that the current Soviet army and navy "are ready to give warmongers a three-fold return." He also said that "as proven by the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Red Army is ready to crush any enemy who dares to invade our country's borders."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet Supreme Soviet, the Nationalities Council and the Union Council, held a joint meeting today. The People's Committee of Finance, Svane Lixi, presented the budget for the next year, with total expenditures of 154,957,000,000 rubles, of which (1) national defense expenditures accounted for 40,885,000,000 rubles, an increase of 13,885,000,000 rubles over this year, (2) national economic expenditures accounted for 59,300,000,000 rubles, and (3) social welfare expenditures accounted for 38,564,000,000 rubles. Svane Lixi also made a speech, stating that the Soviet army is very strong. If other countries dare to invade our borders, they will be dealt a head-on blow and destroyed. In short, the Soviet Union has a population of 170 million people, led by the great Stalin, which no force can destroy. Those madmen who intend to attack our country should know that they will retreat in the face of difficulty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] Former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov attended today's joint meeting of the two houses of the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the 1939 budget. He sat in the front row with Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin and chatted and laughed with other representatives. The British ambassador and other diplomatic envoys were also present.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassadors to Germany and Italy; Rumored to Resign; Dissatisfied with European Policy of the Japanese Cabinet; Arita May Be Forced to Step Down</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to reliable sources, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and Ambassador to Italy Shiratori are dissatisfied with the European policy decided by the Japanese cabinet. This decision contradicts the efforts of the ambassadors to conclude a tripartite military alliance in Europe. The two ambassadors now plan to resign, believing that their work is no longer needed. Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita are currently discussing ways to change the ambassadors' views, but if they are unsuccessful, they will accept the resignations of the two ambassadors. After the two ambassadors resign, Foreign Minister Arita may be forced to step down, and Togo, a diplomat from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who will soon return from Moscow, may be appointed as Foreign Minister. It is expected that the European policy decided by the Japanese cabinet will be announced soon. Shiratori and Oshima refused to send this policy to the German and Italian governments. The current difficulty is that the two ambassadors are carrying out activities to involve Japan in the European situation, while the Japanese government has decided to not interfere in affairs outside of Asia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] It is believed here that Germany and Italy will conclude a military alliance with Japan or Spain (especially the possibility of signing an alliance with Japan is greater) as an Axis response to British, French, and Soviet negotiations. Recent speeches in Japan celebrating the German and Italian military alliance and strengthening the anti-communist agreement have been noted here. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany has recently visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop several times, increasing the difficulties encountered by Japan, which are not insurmountable. Some Japanese sources here indicated that Japan would not be able to strictly adhere to neutrality in the event of a European war.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates; Trade in China; Will Take Appropriate Protection If Necessary; Closely Monitoring French Steps</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Undersecretary Butler today answered a question in the House of Commons regarding the French restriction on the import of Japanese goods into French territories, citing the notes exchanged between France and Japan last year and the use of consular certificates. He said, "The purpose of this method is obviously to obtain a guarantee for the import of French goods into Japan. As for the effect of this method, it is not possible to make any statement as to the extent to which Japanese goods are refused entry into the territory. The British government is closely monitoring the trade interests in the Japanese-controlled areas, so that appropriate protective measures can be taken if necessary." Mr. Henderson asked, "Wouldn't it be better for Britain to act jointly with the French authorities in this matter?" Butler replied, "There are certain difficulties in this matter, but the government is closely monitoring the French steps." Sir Fox then asked whether the Admiralty was satisfied with the current naval strength in the Far East, so as to provide British shipping with legitimate protection against aggression of any kind, and whether the government would consider increasing the British Navy in the Far East. Shakespeare, representing the government, replied that the government was very concerned about the protection of merchant shipping by the British Navy in the Far East, but it did not seem appropriate to announce the future situation of the Far East fleet to the public.</p>
<h3>If Japan Joins the German-Italian Alliance; British-French-Soviet Agreement; Will Extend to the Far East</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 25th] According to sources in Berlin, the German-Italian alliance treaty may be expanded in scope, with Japan joining the alliance. Sources close to the government here recently commented, stating that if this news is true, the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement will inevitably be extended in scope to the Far East. However, to date, Britain has never made this suggestion, nor has the Soviet Union mentioned this level, so as not to increase the difficulty of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Considering Japan's past attitude, this news from Berlin may not be reliable, but if Japan suddenly changes its plan and fully cooperates with the German-Italian Axis, the British response will arrive very soon.</p>
<h3>Iron Lung Man Arrives in Lourdes for Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lourdes, 26th] Iron Lung Man, Schneider, arrived here from the United States today for a pilgrimage. His parents, teachers, doctors, nurses, and assistants traveled with him, and brought two more iron lungs. His father said that he did not expect a miracle to happen to his son, but hoped to obtain spiritual comfort.</p>
<h3>US Department of Commerce Studies; Increase Import Trade; London Rubber Trade Association Resolves; Oppose US Cotton Exchange for Rubber</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 26th] US Secretary of Commerce Hopkins announced that he intends to appoint several experts to thoroughly study the possibility of increasing US import trade. He also said that the US trade surplus of 100,000,000 gold dollars last year was not a healthy phenomenon.</p>

<h3>Japan and the Axis Powers of Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi Xiang</p>
<p>The issue of Japan's relationship with the anti-communist Axis powers seems to be receiving close attention and consideration in Japan. This is because of Germany's proposal that Japan join a military alliance with Italy to oppose the democratic front of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries. However, unexpectedly, opinions among the Japanese people on this proposal are quite divided. Regardless of how the Axis powers exchange views on a military alliance, Japan is always hesitant and unenthusiastic, fearing that it will become trapped in this alliance without being able to extricate itself. Japan is willing to participate in an alliance that directly confronts the Soviet Union, but it opposes joining a broad agreement because Germany would then ask the Japanese fleet to go to Europe in the event of a European war without giving Japan any compensation. Japan suspects that Germany and Italy are trying to obtain a large price for a small reward.</p>
<p>The German-Japanese high-level trade agreement is said to be progressing very poorly because Germany insists on using gold to pay for trade between the two countries, instead of bartering. However, Japan is very short of foreign currency. Therefore, judging from the current situation, Germany and Japan are unlikely to cooperate closely. Furthermore, Japan's interests are mainly in the Far East, while Germany's are in Europe. If a European war breaks out in the future, and Japan joins Germany and Italy in fighting, then the benefits it can obtain will certainly be small. Moreover, the democratic countries are likely to form a united and strong anti-fascist aggression front, so Japan might be defeated. Germany and Italy cannot financially help Japan conquer China, so Japan is unwilling to form a military alliance with them to deal with Britain, France, and the United States, because it still dreams of obtaining a loan from these countries.</p>
<p>From Germany's perspective, Germany is also unwilling for Japan to take military risks in China, because this would not only weaken Germany's advantage when war breaks out in Europe, but also directly destroy Germany's commercial interests in China. Therefore, Germany is attempting to mediate the Sino-Japanese War, restore friendly relations between China and Germany, and promote the harmony of the two peoples. Although there was an incident in the past where Germany recalled its advisors in China, the recent report of a barter trade agreement between China and Germany further proves that although Germany still has dealings with Japan, it is still willing to maintain friendly relations with China. Japan's request to Germany not to transport military materials to China does not seem to have attracted Germany's attention. Similarly, Japan's statement that it might consider ceding Qingdao to Germany has not evoked any reaction in Berlin. German people deeply feel that the value of such temptations, when compared with the losses they would suffer from severing diplomatic relations with China, is really too insignificant to mention. Therefore, no matter how similar their interests and goals may seem on the surface, and despite the frequent exchanges of envoys between the two countries, there is still a great divide between them, separating Japan from the Axis powers and preventing them from approaching each other.</p>
<p>In short, they are only concerned about their own interests and want to use their position in the Axis to obtain the maximum possible benefits. As long as their interests do not conflict with each other, they can coexist peacefully. But once their interests cannot be coordinated and disputes arise, then all their agreements will quickly collapse.</p>
<p>Small Evidence</p>
<h3>Calls for Punishing Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Since the Central News Agency officially announced the news of Wang Jingwei's travels between Japan and Shanghai, Wang Jingwei's usual claims of "anti-communism" and "peace" have completely failed. His [missing text] actions have aroused [missing text] among all Chinese people. They have even aroused [missing text] among Wang Jingwei's close associates (although some of it may be deliberate pretense). Overseas compatriots' [missing text] of Wang can be said to be increasingly激昂, and calls for punishing Wang, demanding that a decree be issued to [missing text] Wang Jingwei, have already resounded in newspapers at home and abroad! Regarding all of Wang Jingwei's current words and deeds, such as how he aids Japan [missing text], this newspaper's editorial today has already pointed out something. We humbly hope that the central government can examine the interests of the nation and the country, heed public opinion at home and abroad, and implement appropriate measures of [missing text] against Wang. This will not only strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front lines, but also greatly benefit the national spiritual mobilization, the cause of resistance and national reconstruction, and the cause of true world peace. It is truly dependent on this!</p>
<h3>The Supreme Soviet</h3>
<p>The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened on the 25th evening, with 1,200 delegates in attendance, representing more than 100 ethnic groups. At a time when the entire capitalist world and all colonies and semi-colonies are engulfed in the flames of a new war, this Supreme Soviet, convened on a vast land of independence, freedom, and happiness, naturally deserves the attention of people around the world.</p>
<p>From the 10th to the 21st of March, the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party once reported how the Soviet Union faithfully promoted the cause of peace, maintained world peace, advocated democratic institutions, aided oppressed nations, and opposed the policy of aggression. It also told us that due to the development of the Soviet national economy, the improvement of the people's cultural and material lives, and the strengthening of national defense capabilities, it is sufficient to guarantee that the Soviet Union will be able to faithfully and smoothly implement this policy. This Supreme Soviet will conduct more concrete discussions on diplomatic, economic, and national defense issues, and formulate resolutions representing the common will of the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. It will certainly make greater contributions to the consolidation and development of the Soviet Union, and to the development and achievement of the international anti-aggression and anti-fascist movement!</p>
<p>Since the start of our country's resistance war, the facts of the past twenty-odd months have proven that the Soviet Union is indeed one of China's most faithful friendly nations. We should naturally express our joy and congratulations for the development of the Soviet Union's national strength and the improvement of its international reputation. We should naturally express even more respect and wish success to this Supreme Soviet, with its 1,200-odd delegates representing more than 100 ethnic groups. At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to learn from the Soviet Union, adhere to internal unity, resolutely resist [missing character] and eliminate traitors, enhance national strength and prestige, and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, in order to promote the Soviet Union's national aid-China movement, and especially to encourage the aid-China and anti-Japanese movement in Britain, the United States, and France! Today, the world will undoubtedly recognize that the development of the national strength of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will be the strongest guarantee of world peace!</p>

<h3>Three British Merchant Ships Detained in Guangzhou for Over Seven Months Released and Return to Hong Kong — Tung An, Ta Ming, and Tai Lee Arrive in Succession Yesterday Afternoon — Falsely Accused of Carrying Military Supplies, They Were Raided and Plundered on Board</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, there were more than ten foreign merchant ships, large and small, trapped on the Pearl River and West River in Guangzhou. After the [missing character] army occupied Yueyuan, they deliberately detained the foreign ships under the pretext that the waterways were dangerous. It was not until recently, after the consuls of various countries made great efforts to negotiate, that the [missing character] side released the foreign ships one after another. Jinshan, Guangxi, Jiangsu, and many other ships have escaped danger and returned to Hong Kong one after another. Guangdong of the Tong An Company, Ta Ming of the Fu An Company, and Tai Lee of the Si Yi Company were still detained. After the British Consul stationed in Guangdong continued to negotiate with the [missing character] side, they were finally allowed to return to Hong Kong yesterday. They arrived one after another after 4 pm. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Returning to Hong Kong Yesterday</p>
<p>The British ships returning to Hong Kong from the province yesterday included Tung An of the Tong An Company, Ta Ming of the Fu An Company, and Tai Lee of the Si Yi Company. They left the province at 8:30 yesterday morning. The ships had received notice from the [missing character] side beforehand to unload all the cargo on board the day before departure. At 8:00 yesterday morning, the [missing character] side sent troops on board to search extensively. Under the pretext of inspection, they wantonly harassed the crew. The ships did not carry any passengers, only a few foreigners were on board to come to Hong Kong. At 8:30, they set sail from the provincial river, with Tung An taking the lead, followed by Ta Ming, and then Tai Lee bringing up the rear. The [missing character] side did not send any ships to guide them, only two "pilots" were sent to steer Tung An as a guide. Ta Ming and Tai Lee followed behind to the exit. At about 9:00, when the Tai Lee ship bringing up the rear reached the Sanzhi Xiang River, the officer in the officer's cabin mistakenly steered off course, causing it to run aground and unable to move forward. The shipowner immediately telegraphed the Tung An and Ta Ming ships for help. Upon receiving the news, the two ships immediately stopped sailing. One of the [missing character] "pilots" from the Tung An ship crossed over to the Tai Lee ship to take over as helmsman, and then continued to sail forward. When the Tung An and Tai Lee ships sailed to outside Humen, the [missing character] pilot immediately [missing character] the ship and returned to the province. The two ships continued to steam to Hong Kong. The Tung An ship arrived at Ang Chuan Zhou at 3:00 pm to be quarantined by the Hong Kong medical officer. It docked at the pier at 3:00 pm. The Ta Ming ship and Tai Lee ship were delayed until nightfall before arriving in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Crew Talk</p>
<p>According to the crew of the Tung An ship, when Guangzhou fell, the ship sailed away from the pier with the other foreign ships and anchored near Shamian. A long time after Guangzhou fell, there was still no news of returning to Hong Kong. The [missing character] soldiers frequently boarded the ships to conduct searches and harassment. Many of the metal items on the ship were plundered by the [missing character] army. Other items were also taken away by the [missing character] army. The ship was under the control of the [missing character] army and there was nothing that could be done. After the ship stopped sailing, the members of the upper levels of each department were stationed on the ship. Although the [missing character] military authorities did not prohibit the crew members of the foreign ships from going ashore, they threatened the crew that they should not take risks unless necessary. A few people wanted to see the situation in the city and left the ship to go ashore, but when they landed, they were insulted and searched all over by the [missing character] soldiers. In addition to the confiscation of money, the documents in their pockets were not spared. When they entered the city, they were beaten and humiliated by the [missing character] soldiers on guard. Therefore, most of the crew members did not dare to go ashore. For seven and a half months, they were trapped on the ship, no different from being under house arrest.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Regarding the process of negotiating the return to port of the above-mentioned ships, according to the reporter's investigation, at the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, the [missing character] army used the pretext that the waterway mines had not been cleared and the Pearl River could not be opened, and detained the foreign merchant ships in the provincial river. Most of those detained were British merchant ships. Therefore, the British authorities, at the request of various shipping companies, instructed the British Consul-General in Guangdong to negotiate with the [missing character] side, requesting that the trapped ships be released and returned to Hong Kong as soon as possible. Upon receiving the order, the British Consul immediately negotiated with the [missing character] side based on reason. The [missing character] side made various excuses to delay the matter. On the one hand, they sent a large number of [missing character] ships to and from Guangzhou and neighboring ports, monopolizing the shipping rights of the Pearl River. In these seven months, although the British Consul urged the [missing character] side to release the ships with all his strength, there were no results. It was not until a month ago, after the British authorities made further strong representations, that the ships were released one after another. Tung An, Tai Lee, and Ta Ming, which returned to Hong Kong yesterday, will be the last batch to leave the province. The three ships were originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong with Guangxi a week ago, but they temporarily received a notice from the [missing character] side to reschedule their departure to yesterday. Only Quanxing is still left in the provincial river.</p>
<p>No Military Supplies</p>
<p>It was found that at the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, the [missing character] side falsely claimed that the foreign ships left in Qingzhou contained military supplies for our army, so they detained them. At the same time, they released rumors that each ship had carried military supplies that had not been unloaded when they went to the province from the port. Yesterday, a foreign news report in Hong Kong also had the following record: "Four British merchant ships trapped in Guangzhou were approved by the Japanese authorities to return to Hong Kong today." But they were only allowed to carry ordinary cargo, and other military supplies had to be unloaded before leaving Guangzhou. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the claim that each ship was carrying military supplies is absolutely inaccurate. When each ship went to the province from the port, they were carrying ordinary foreign goods and food. After arriving in the province, they were completely unloaded and returned to the cargo owners. On the day of the blockade of Humen, each ship had loaded export goods in preparation for shipping them to Hong Kong. Until they left Hong Kong yesterday, all the goods were unloaded. Moreover, each ship was searched repeatedly by the [missing character] army during the period of detention, and no military supplies were found. The so-called carrying of military supplies is absolutely groundless. In fact, the [missing character] army used it as an excuse to make things difficult for the foreign ships.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in the Dead City</p>
<p>A certain merchant arrived in Hong Kong yesterday on the Tung An ship. When the reporter asked about the recent situation in the dead city, he said that the degree of terror and chaos in the city after the [missing character] army occupied Guangzhou for half a year has not diminished from the initial fall. The residents who stayed in the city initially thought that the situation in Guangzhou could be stabilized soon. Now that they have witnessed everything in the city falling into silence, they have also left the city one after another. Recently, because our army's counterattack is becoming more urgent, more and more people are fleeing. Although the [missing character] army is trying its best to publicize that order in the city has been restored, the demonstration of facts has become the opposite. Whether it is day or night, bandits can run rampant in any prosperous area of the city. The puppet police have no weapons. They cannot stop the bandits from robbing, but instead have to avoid them. In the past month, guerrillas in the suburbs have frequently launched attacks on the [missing character] army in the city. The [missing character] army is quite bewildered. Although the [missing character] side tried its best to cover it up, the frequent movement of troops and transportation of wounded soldiers every day could not completely hide it from the ears and eyes of foreigners. In the financial aspect, legal tender is still circulating smoothly. The [missing character] army forces the use of military banknotes, but the citizens have refused to accept them in many ways. Therefore, there are very few [missing character] military banknotes circulating in the market.</p>
<h3>Homeless Paupers to Be Sent to Refugee Camps</h3>
<p>Local medical authorities are planning to send homeless paupers sleeping on the streets to government refugee camps for resettlement. This move by the authorities is intended to have a positive impact on public health in Hong Kong. Moreover, refugee camps have various educational and handicraft facilities. After the paupers move in, they will have many opportunities to receive education and learn skills, which will greatly benefit the paupers directly. The Medical Department also requires the cooperation of the police to be responsible for relocating the refugees. As for the temporary structures built in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon some time ago, the authorities have also ordered them to be dismantled as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Hong Kong Manufacturers to Fill Out Itemized Forms — To Be Submitted Every Six Months — Safeguarding Domestic Products and Preventing Counterfeiting</h3>
<p>In order to protect the production of domestic goods in our country and eliminate malpractices such as counterfeiting domestic goods, after issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is now conducting stricter inspections to avoid mixing the genuine with the fake. It recently sent a letter to manufacturers in Hong Kong stating that all manufacturers who have already received certificates of origin for domestic goods should fill out an itemized form every six months from now on. The Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers Association has already received the notification letter and has forwarded it to the manufacturers to comply with. The notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs is recorded as follows: Ministry of Economic Affairs Notification Gongzi No. 26521. Upon investigation, the regulations of our Ministry for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods were revised and promulgated in July of the 27th year. However, the internal situation of each manufacturer that has already received a certificate of origin for domestic goods is subject to change from time to time. If we do not examine them closely at any time, it will be difficult to make [missing character] meetings. The following measures are hereby determined to be implemented: (1) All manufacturers who have already received a certificate of origin for domestic goods shall fill out an itemized form once every [missing character] months and submit it to our Ministry for record. The form shall be the same as the itemized form to be submitted when applying for a certificate of origin for domestic goods. (2) The itemized form to be filled out shall be submitted to the local competent authority for [missing character], or sent to the local legal industrial and commercial organization for certification before being submitted for review. The certification procedures shall be handled in accordance with the method of filling out and submitting the itemized form for applying for a certificate of origin for domestic goods. In addition to notifying separately, the Association is hereby instructed to send a copy to inform the Chinese factories in Hong Kong that have already received certificates of origin for domestic goods to comply with and report on schedule. This is hereby notified, Minister Weng Wenhao.</p>
<h3>Cool Weather After the Rain</h3>

<p>The Consul General of Portugal in Hong Kong has been ordered to be transferred to Johannesburg as Consul General and will leave Hong Kong on June 3. Before the new Consul General Nabor Caetano takes office, the affairs of the Consulate will be temporarily handled by Soares de Albergaria.</p>
<h3>Fishmonger Beats Girl</h3>
<p>Perpetrator Sentenced to One Month</p>
<p>At 4:00 pm on the [missing character] of April, when the New Central Market was crowded with customers, a thirteen-year-old girl, Chen Wanglan, bought fish from a certain fish stall. She had a quarrel with the fishmonger Chen Qi (35 years old) over a small matter. Chen actually punched and kicked Yulan. Yulan could not withstand the violence and was beaten unconscious. Afterwards, detectives arrived at the scene and arrested Chen. The injured person was sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious and she has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The detective authorities then charged Chen with assaulting the girl Chen Yulan at the Central Magistracy. The case was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Yi Shitang. The defendant admitted to committing the assault without hesitation, saying that on that day, the plaintiff came to his place to buy fish for nine cents. After agreeing on the price, the plaintiff gave four cents less. He then negotiated with her, but she suddenly grabbed his clothes, tearing them. He could not bear it, so he slapped her. Now he admits that what he did was inappropriate and asks for leniency. The official sentenced him to a fine of 20 yuan or imprisonment for one month.</p>

<h3>Education Authorities — Cracking Down on Excessive Admissions by Schools — Actively Investigating — Regulations on School Building to Student Ratio</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Education Authorities have strict regulations for schools, with strict stipulations on the seating on each floor, and students should not be admitted in excess, which would impede the sanitation of the students. However, since the unrest in South China, the number of students has increased sharply. Among them, not a small number only want to charge more tuition and do not care about student hygiene, accepting all and arranging more seats. Some even have less than three to four cubic feet per seat. It seems that this has a profound impact on student hygiene. The Education Authorities have paid close attention to this and are now actively investigating. Those who only seek excessive admissions and deviate from the regulations on seating area will be cracked down on. The crackdown method is to issue a serious warning for the first time and urge them to improve quickly. If they still do not improve, they will be punished. If the violation is too serious, their school license may be revoked.</p>
<h3>Smugglers and Tax Police — Major Battle Near Shenzhen — Guerrilla Troops Sent to Assist — Thirteen Male and Female Smugglers Captured</h3>
<p>The ferocity and rampancy of smugglers on the Sino-British border are unprecedented today. Whenever there is a search, they resist with guns. On the 23rd of this month, dozens of smugglers occurred again in the Shenzhen area, transporting [missing character] goods for import, intending to transfer them to Changping along the railway. This was discovered by the Tax Bureau, which ordered an inspection. The smugglers resisted inspection with guns. As a result, a total of thirteen smugglers were arrested on the spot. Yesterday, the reporter took a special car to various parties to investigate the truth. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Quiet Night, Gunshots</p>
<p>It was found that Shenzhen and the Hong Kong border are closely related. The defenses are tight. Recently, a general group of smugglers took advantage of the chaos of the war in South China and suddenly became active. The Tax Bureau reported this and severely suppressed them. At 4:20 am on the 23rd of this month, a small station not far from Shenzhen near the British border suddenly heard gunshots in the quiet night, echoing far and wide. The residents were awakened by the gunshots from their sweet dreams. The residents initially thought that [missing character] cavalry were launching a night attack, and fled to the British border in a panic. The scene of panic can be imagined.</p>
<p>Inspecting Smugglers, Major Battle</p>
<p>It was later found that the incident was caused by smugglers opening fire to resist the inspection. On the morning of the 23rd, a total of ten male and female smugglers were secretly transporting a large batch of inferior goods for import, using four-wheeled handcarts, along the Chinese section of the railway, intending to transfer them to Changping. This was discovered by the Tax Bureau, which quietly dispatched many inspectors to lie in ambush near Shenzhen Station, waiting for the smugglers to pass by and intercept them. At that time, the search officers saw dozens of smugglers walking in single file and wanted to stop them. However, due to the disparity in numbers, they did not dare to neglect the importance of public order. Therefore, they shouted for them to stop and inspect when they were not far away from the smugglers. Unexpectedly, the smugglers not only turned a deaf ear to this, but also did not restrict the stoppage and continued to rush forward as before. The inspectors were forced to fire their guns to demonstrate to the smugglers. Unexpectedly, the smugglers were not afraid of the law and returned fire to resist the inspectors. For a time, gunshots were very dense, like firecrackers.</p>
<p>Male and Female Smugglers, All Captured</p>
<p>The guerrillas and county police stationed in a certain place suddenly heard gunshots in the middle of the night and did not know what had happened. They followed the sound and rushed to Shenzhen Station. They found that it was a conflict between smugglers and inspectors. They cooperated with the inspectors of the Tax Bureau to inflict pain on the smugglers. As a result of the fierce battle, the smugglers were defeated. Thirteen male and female smugglers were captured on the spot. At the same time, three short guns were seized. The guerrillas, county police, and inspectors of the Tax Bureau escorted the captured smugglers to the Guerrilla Headquarters in a certain charity hall nearby for questioning. The reporter believed that the matter was of great importance and specially visited a certain senior official at the headquarters to inquire about everything. According to reports, the headquarters attached great importance to the case and had discussed the response with the bureau in the future. At the same time, the seized inferior goods would be resolved immediately and confiscated according to law. The smugglers who resisted inspection with guns would be escorted to the headquarters for strict handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Dance to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives held a dance last night at 9:00 PM at the Hong Kong Hotel to raise funds. Celebrities from all walks of life here attended. Dresses fluttered, creating a magnificent scene. That night, local Hong Kong socialites and young ladies performed songs and dances, including classical dance, piano solos, waltzes, Chinese sword dance, and four sets of songs and dances, as well as Egyptian dance. The program was very rich. The joyful gathering ended at 2:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong!</h3>
<p>Designated as a Cholera Port</p>
<p>The authorities in the Dutch East Indies and Tianjin have declared Hong Kong a cholera-infected port. Ships traveling from Hong Kong to those locations must be quarantined at sea, it is said.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Muslims and the × Muslim Leader Vehemently Denounce [It]</h3>
<p>The Muslim Community Consistently Supports the Central Government, All Believers Fight for the Country</p>
<p>Rumors have spread in Guangdong × that prominent Guangzhou Muslims such as Mr. Ma, Mr. Zhou, and Mr. He have formed a so-called "Muslim Autonomous Association" in Guangzhou. A reporter learned that the Muslims in the ninth shed of the Kam Tin refugee camp in Hong Kong, who are refugees from Guangzhou, would likely know about this false organization. He specially visited Zhou Shanzhi, the Muslim leader of that shed, to inquire about everything. He was granted an audience and had the following conversation.</p>
<p>Question (Reporter asks, similarly below): Regarding the news from Guangzhou × that prominent Muslims such as Mr. Ma have formed a "Muslim Autonomous Association" in Guangzhou, has your honorable leader heard of this?</p>
<p>Answer (Muslim Leader Zhou Shanzhi answers, similarly below): This shed consists of</p>
<p>Refugees Fleeing from Guangzhou</p>
<p>who came here. They share the same hatred towards the × people's invasion. The honorable leader, along with those in the same shed and other refugees residing elsewhere, have absolutely no involvement with the said false organization.</p>
<p>Question: What are your honorable leader's thoughts on this matter? May they be revealed?</p>
<p>Answer: We Chinese Muslims are one of the five major ethnic groups. We have always strictly adhered to the "Quran," which says, "Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors." It also says, "Have they not broken their oaths and determined to expel the Messenger, and they began against you the first time? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you are [truly] believers." Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad's legacy states, "Love of homeland belongs to faith (i.e., virtue)." The scriptures on defending the faith say, "When the × people invade a fortress, resistance is the divine duty of the local men and women. When news of the invasion reaches people in other places, it is also their divine duty." Therefore, our believers have always been devoted to</p>
<p>Defending the Country</p>
<p>and dedicated to serving on the battlefield. Throughout history, there have been such people. In the past, during the Korean War, General Zuo Baozhen sacrificed himself resisting ××. During the Boxer Rebellion, General Ma Yueshou died resisting foreign ×. After the September 18th Incident, during the Battle of Shanhaiguan, General An Dexin bravely fought ×× and gave his life. These are just a few examples of the facts. There are countless others who have been loyal, patriotic, and sacrificed their lives. As for those currently serving in the government, participating in the national salvation effort, directing military planning, and resisting ××, there are quite a few. I cannot list them all. Muslims are willing to sacrifice for national salvation because they have been deeply influenced by the Quran and teachings.</p>
<p>Since the "July 7th" Marco Polo Bridge Incident years ago, ××'s iron hooves have trampled everywhere, turning homes into ruins. Countless of our believers have been subjected to the butchery of ××. Since the full-scale war of resistance began, under the leadership of General Bai Chongxi, the chairman of the "Muslim National Salvation Association," Chinese Muslims have unanimously and resolutely</p>
<p>Supported the Central Government</p>
<p>adhering to the established national policy and the war of resistance advocated by the Supreme Leader, Chairman Chiang, gritting their teeth, enduring pain, standing on the same front, uniting sincerely, and fighting to the end, striving to win the final victory. This is the united mindset and expectation of our Chinese Muslims.</p>
<p>This time, Guangzhou unfortunately fell, and countless compatriots suffered ×××. We did not want to groan under ××××, and many have come here for refuge or fled to various villages. Those who still reside in Guangzhou are mostly those who could not escape in time during the chaos. However, their numbers are small, and they have no power. Our Muslim custom is to have the imams of the various mosques as our leaders. In Guangzhou, there are five mosques: "Guangta Wei," "Xiao Dongying," "Danan Road," "Haopan Street," and "Eastern Suburbs." All the imams, such as Yang Ruisheng, Wang Zhengxuan, Ma Renfeng, and myself, have gone to Hong Kong and Macau for refuge. To put it simply, the Muslims in Guangzhou are like leaderless dragons. The "××× Newspaper" is a publication under the dominion of ×× and has no value. As for the established "Muslim Autonomous Association," it is undoubtedly a puppet organization.</p>
<p>The People of the Association</p>
<p>are a bunch of two or three shameless individuals and have no qualification to represent our Guangdong Muslims. As for Mr. Ma and others staying in Guangzhou, forming a fake association under the influence of the × people, whether they have other motives or are suffering from the oppression of the environment, we do not know.</p>
<p>Reaching this point in the conversation, Muslim Leader Zhou solemnly and sternly said, "We dare to resolutely declare that the said false organization is a despicable tool used by the × people. All Guangdong Muslims vow to oppose it to the death. We have heard that the false association will announce its establishment on May 26th, but no matter how it operates, we will absolutely deny it, and it will not have any effect or influence the division of our Muslim unity and determination to resist the war. Those ×× will only waste their efforts, seeing their schemes fail day by day."</p>

<p>Chairman Li Han-hun Intends to Improve the Baojia System</p>
<p>Determines Autonomous Funding, Cancels Zero-Extraction Method, Appoints Young Cadres, Increases Salaries</p>
<p>(Shaoguan Special Dispatch) The Baojia system is the foundation of political facilities. If the principles are sound, all political measures can be carried out smoothly. Local autonomy in Guangdong Province has been in operation for years, but due to adherence to old methods and lack of funds, it has not achieved satisfactory results, which has greatly affected administrative advancement. The provincial review of local autonomy has identified</p>
<p>Past Shortcomings</p>
<p>in approximately the following areas: (1) Most township chiefs have not been trained, and even those who have been trained often lack practical knowledge. There are no less than 70,000 district, township, village, Bao, and Jia chiefs in the province. Since many have not been trained, it is not easy to promote autonomous Baojia work. (2) Autonomous funding is difficult, and township chiefs' livelihoods cannot be resolved. Baojia chiefs also receive only three jiao per month for office expenses, and less in impoverished areas. As a result, the overall status of township and Baojia chiefs has not been raised. In a poor living and low status, it is not easy for township chiefs to be filled by outstanding members of society, which naturally reduces the effectiveness of their work. (3) In recent years, counties have handled Baojia expenses by levying taxes per household (autonomous household donations), collecting between half a hao and one hao per household per month. The amount is small, and the frequency is high, causing the people to feel disturbed and the Bao and Jia chiefs to feel troubled. The two sides often have disharmony, which greatly affects the implementation of autonomy. (4) Our country is in the process of discarding the old and establishing the new. At this time, frictions often occur between new and old forces in local areas. Young people accuse their predecessors of being outdated and corrupt, and their predecessors accuse young people of being naive and frivolous. As a result, many local undertakings are consumed by this kind of conflict in the coordination of new and old forces. Guangdong is the source of revolution. In politics, economics, culture, etc., they all have superior conditions, but the reason why political soldiers cannot promote Qingming is that the autonomous Baojia is not perfect, which is the biggest reason. Recently, it was heard that Chairman Li Han-hun had already seen this result at the beginning of his inauguration, and his</p>
<p>Transformation Plan</p>
<p>has now been largely decided. Its main content includes: (1) The first step is to determine that the annual autonomous funding for the entire province will be 9 million yuan, which will be planned and distributed by the provincial government. The current fragmented autonomous funding levy will be cancelled to reduce provincial disturbances. The newly determined autonomous funding will be used in part for training and for autonomous cadres, and in part for the living expenses of autonomous personnel and for public expenses. Although the amount of salary is not as expected for a while, after the province's finances are reorganized and the provincial treasury's income increases, the second step will be to increase funding and increase the living expenses and office expenses of autonomous personnel. In the five months since the provincial government was reorganized, due to the impact of the war of resistance, the provincial treasury's income has been difficult to reduce, but because of its best efforts to curb one expenditure, it is not in line with each other. Many of them were ordered to be paid and can be led back in the future. There is also a plan for how to reorganize taxes and increase revenue in a rational manner that does not hinder people's livelihoods. Province-wide revenue can be gradually increased. The overall planning of autonomous expenses is very promising. (2) Autonomous personnel at all levels, such as township chiefs and Baojia chiefs, will be appointed with trained or experienced outstanding young people to raise the vigorous vitality of society. The predecessors in the local area will be in a guiding position. The younger generation is willing to get the support of the experienced fathers and brothers, and the older generation is also happy to guide the younger generation. In this way, the frictions can be eliminated and the strength can be increased. The status and life of autonomous personnel have been improved, and the harmony and coordination of personnel have been added. The elimination of fragmented donations and draws has led to popular support, working together, and with one heart, the autonomous Baojia cause in the local area will surely be implemented with great vigor and will be effective day by day. This plan can be submitted to the Provincial Council Meeting soon and implemented after being approved.</p>
<h3>Zengcheng × Army Launches Surprise Attack on Boluo and Is Repelled</h3>
<p>We Closely Monitor Them in Nankeng and Other Places</p>
<p>(Dongjiang Express News) On the Dongjiang front, the × army strongholds at Zhucun and Danzao on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway, and at Shijiao and Shilong on the Guangzhou-Wuzhou Highway, have been repeatedly attacked by our army in the past half month. Zengcheng × is surrounded on all sides, unable to advance or retreat. In addition, guarding Zengcheng alone will be exhausted. They had to reluctantly mobilize a part of their troops to launch a counterattack, attempting to relieve the siege of Dongjiang and prevent our westward advance. A week ago, they had attempted to cross Boluo, but were repelled by our army and the local militia. Yesterday morning, the 24th, at 9:00 AM, Zengcheng × again sent about 200 infantry and cavalry to harass the area near Lianhe and Futian. Our army's Chen Ji received the news and, together with Luo's guerrilla militia led by Zaihua, intercepted them in separate directions. After several hours of fierce fighting, the × forces were defeated and fled across the Zengjiang River along the Litchi Stream. According to intelligence, the × army is mostly stationed around Dajiang Market and still has designs on Boluo. Our troops are guarding the Jigongkeng, Huanglongku, and Fushuling areas and are closely monitoring them to ensure that they do not succeed.</p>
<h3>After × Planes Bomb Shantou</h3>
<p>Chaoyang Suffers a Calamity</p>
<p>The Dead and Wounded Total Dozens, The Population Is Now Being Evacuated</p>
<p>(Shantou Special Dispatch) On the 24th, a × aircraft carrier and four × transport ships sailed from Xiamen to Shantou. After a brief stop, they sailed to Guangzhou. The aircraft carrier anchored off Mayu Island in Shantou and dispatched nine planes, which invaded Chao-Shan twice, around 12:30 PM and around 1:00 PM. Each raid lasted for more than an hour. The first reconnaissance targeted Mayu Island and Jiaoshi Mountain in Shantou Port, dropping nine bombs on the poor residential area beside the Shantou Bird Bridge Beihai. They destroyed more than 20 fir shops, glass factories, and shacks, injuring one old woman. Two bombs fell near the Huilan Bridge, three bombs fell at the intersection of Xinma Road and Handi Road, destroying dozens of houses. Another bomb fell in the water near Huilan Bridge, and one did not explode. Around 1:00 PM, they passed by Chaoyang and went out to sea. The second raid directly attacked the densely populated urban area of Chaoyang, dropping more than 20 bombs on the main street of the county government, the county high school, and the Chen Family Ancestral Hall area, destroying dozens of houses, killing 13, and injuring dozens more. The aircraft carrier is still moored in Linghai. After the incident, the Shantou community welfare group set out to express condolences in the affected areas. The various benevolent halls' burial teams and rescue teams rushed to Chaoyang to assist in excavation and rescue. In addition, starting on the 26th, the population will be forcibly evacuated to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The forced evacuation of the elderly and weak population will be handled by the various jie (community) bureaus, which will dispatch police to escort them to the car and boat companies for free transportation out of the area. The number of people has now been thoroughly investigated, and population evacuation notices have been issued, respectively ordering the car and boat companies to transport those carrying these documents out of the area free of charge.</p>
<h3>Director Zhang Hui Orders Ban on Exporting Herbs to Aid ×</h3>
<p>(Zhongshan News) Guangdong × suffer from water and soil incompatibility, many suffering from beriberi, many dying from it. Now they are using traitors to widely collect medicinal herbs in the interior of the Siyi area and transport them to Hong Kong and Macau for assistance. Zhongshan County Director Zhang Hui immediately ordered the various inspection agencies to investigate and prohibit it after receiving the report. The order stated, "According to reports, recently, the × who landed in South China suffer from water and soil incompatibility and many suffer from beriberi. They are using traitors to widely collect Artemisia and motherwort in the interior and transport them to Hong Kong and Macau to aid × urgently. This should be strictly investigated and prohibited."</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Telephones Subordinates To Strictly Prohibit Obstructing Mail Transport</h3>
<p>Highway Bureau and Car Merchants Must Not Hold Back Mail</p>
<p>Villagers Who Find Mail Must Send It to the Local Post Office</p>
<p>(Shaoguan Express News) The provincial government yesterday telegraphed its subordinates, stating that the committee's Guilin headquarters issued a message, "The postal service is a national transportation undertaking, and its responsibility is significant, especially during this period of resistance and national construction. The military mail transmission, the communication of news between the front and rear, as well as the advancement of politics and the promotion of culture, all rely on the postal service, and the rapid transmission of orders relies on the postal service. In addition to self-owned vehicles, other means of transportation are needed to assist it in order to complete its mission and achieve its ultimate goal. Recently, the diversion road bureau and the commercial transport car company often return the mail, often not transferring it according to schedule, because the military transport is frequent and many vehicles are sealed off for use, resulting in delays and affecting wartime communication. Although I have negotiated several times, the result has not changed. It is proposed that you order the highway bureau and the business military company to transport the mail quickly and do not delay it, and that Gui Province is now becoming an important area for mail transportation in and out. There are many mail shipments to and from the frequent shipments, and the escort employees may be negligent in their protection. It is inevitable that they will be lost on the way, and there are many villagers who find mailbags and return them to the post office. There are also people who extort money or hide and do not report it, affecting the transportation of mail and communication, which is very worrying. In order to remedy this, in addition to strictly ordering all employees who escort the mail to pay close attention, you are also requested to notify the county governments, townships, and public offices to pay attention on their behalf, and to inform all villagers that if they find mailbags, they should immediately send them to the nearby post office for processing, and they must not extort rewards or hide and not report, in order to emphasize official duties and benefit communication, etc."</p>
<h3>× Warships and Planes Harass Beihai</h3>
<p>Three Air Raids Cause Considerable Losses in the Urban Area</p>
<p>British Ship Jiaying Is Also Boarded for Inspection</p>
<p>(Nanlu Express News) In the coastal counties of Nanlu in Guangdong Province, × warships have been appearing and harassing them in recent days, and × planes have been scouting and bombing them, causing unease among the people. The authorities have also taken the necessary preparations, as reported in previous reports. On the 19th, × planes and × warships jointly attacked Beihai again. The urban area of Beihai suffered considerable losses from the bombing. On the afternoon of that day, at 1:40 PM, a three-funnel × cruiser sneaked into the sea off the Longwang Temple in Beihai and roamed back and forth. At 2:00 PM, a × plane took off from the ship and flew to Gaode, a suburb of Beihai, dropping four bombs. One bomb each hit the Hede Pawnshop, destroying a corner of the watchtower, and affected the adjacent Liu Shenglun store and three shops across the street. One bomb hit the Honglihao store in Fish Street, destroying it completely. Two bombs hit an open space in the Red Tile Kiln, causing no damage. After the × plane did its evil deed, it fled. A few days later, it flew out of the ship again and sneaked into the airspace of Beihai City, dropping four bombs. One bomb landed at No. 21 Haizhu East Road, and Nos. 209, 22, and 22 each hit one bomb, destroying two houses. One bomb fell at No. 231, destroying three poles. At the same time, the × warship suddenly fired more than 20 shots continuously at the Di Jiao area. Four shells landed in the Di Jiao village, destroying three houses, killing five people, and injuring more than ten people. The rest fled into the wilderness. When the × planes and × warships were wreaking havoc, they launched two more steam launches, each carrying 15 and 16 × soldiers, respectively, to spy along the coast. They chased after our fishing boats at sea. Five of them were unable to escape and were captured by them. More than ten fishermen were killed, and the fishing boats were set on fire at night. At 4:00 PM, a × plane attacked Beihai for the third time, dropping four more bombs in the Haizhu Li area. One bomb hit the vegetable market, destroying the central seat. One bomb fell at No. 60, destroying three houses. One bomb fell at No. 66, destroying it completely. One bomb landed between Nos. 62, 64, and 68, all of which were destroyed. In total, Beihai was bombed three times in one day, killing only one woman, one man, and one boy, and injuring 22 people. At the same time that the × navy and air force jointly harassed us, the British merchant ship Jiaying happened to be passing through the area. × ignored international law and sent soldiers to board the ship for inspection, causing a disturbance for a while before leaving.</p>
<h3>Counterattack on Jiangmen Gains Victory After Victory</h3>
<p>Recapture Mo Ku Mountain and Other Places and Advance into the City</p>
<p>Rumors of × Army Landing at Niuwan Shizui Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>(Zhongshan Express News) According to military intelligence, our Han attack on Jiang Hui is progressing victoriously. On the Xinhe Road front, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the Duruan Binggen Mulang area on the 24th, annihilating many ×. They took advantage of the victory to advance to Jiangmen via the Mu Chuang and Luolai routes. To the east of Penglai, our Deng brigade's ×× troops encountered the × near Wucun, killing more than a hundred ×. After our army swept away the remnants of × from Wucun and Modou Mountain, they continued to advance. At 8:00 PM that night, our vanguard had already reached the vicinity of Baishi Street and recaptured the key points of Tiancheng Temple, Chan Tou, Mo Ku Mountain, and Wai Jingkou, advancing to Penglai Mulang. In order to cut off the connection between Jiang Hui and ×, our army continued to advance into Xiaogui Jia on the morning of the 24th. There were more than a hundred × soldiers stationed there. Seeing our army rushing in, they retreated immediately. Our soldiers bravely chased them and engaged in fierce fighting with × in the Buqi Bang area. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, our army once rushed to the Metropolis Station, killing many × and setting fire to the baggage stored by × at the station. For a while, the fire was soaring, visible for several miles. After dark, × reinforcements arrived from Jiangmen, more than 500 people. On the morning of the 25th, our × were still fighting fiercely near Qibang. In addition, our guerrillas hiding in the suburbs of Huicheng attacked × every night. On the evening of the 23rd, the × at Huimin Gate were annihilated by our guerrillas, killing more than people. The × army became angry with embarrassment. At 7:00 AM on the 24th, they dispatched eight planes from Jiangmen to fly low along Xinkai Road for reconnaissance, firing machine guns and dropping dozens of bombs wildly in Siqian. Then, they passed over Daze and dropped six or seven bombs at the Daze ferry, sinking six or seven small boats and killing or injuring more than ten Dan families, destroying countless civilian houses. On the evening of the 24th, a large public welfare ship towed several civilian boats from Muzhou back to Public Welfare, without being inspected. The garrison opened fire to stop them. The villagers mistakenly thought that × were coming to commit crimes. The current investigation of Niuwan and other places shows no trace of ×. The defense is peaceful.</p>
<p>Movies and Theater</p>
<h3>Red "Blue" Film and Three Primary Color Films</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's "Woman Warrior" is a color film of red and "blue" primary colors. After its release, the theory world unanimously praised it, but some people raised objections about the praise for color performance. Here, I would like to provide some principles that I have seen in books for reference, but I hope not to "insider" and pour cold water on my sincerity in teaching.</p>
<p>Color has the distinction between light color and paint color. There are different lengths of light waves mixed in the sunlight. The presentation of seven colors is due to the different lengths of light waves. When white light passes through a red film, it appears red. The reason is that only red light waves can pass through the red film, so it appears red. Because equal components of the three light colors red (Red), blue (Blue), and green (Green) mix to form white, the usual red and green are called the three primary colors of light colors. This is different from the three primary colors of paint colors. In terms of light color, equal components of blue and green mix to form cyan (Blue-Green). Therefore, two parts of cyan mixed with one part of red also become white. The red "blue" mentioned here is cyan. We can see that the colors obtained from the three primary colors can also be obtained from the red "blue" two primary colors, but because the matching components are different, it is more troublesome. In fact, red and blue mix to form yellow (Yellow), and red and green mix to form magenta (Magenta). Using yellow and green or magenta and blue as two primary colors can also achieve the same result. The generation of object color is the same as that of paint color. An object that can absorb green light waves and reflect red and blue will appear yellow. If it can absorb red light and reflect blue and green, it will appear magenta. Therefore, for example, when using three primary color lenses to capture a yellow object, the paper only retains a considerable component of shadows on the red and blue sheets, but not on the green sheet. When using red "cover" two primary color lenses to capture a yellow object, both the red sheet and the "blue" sheet (cyan sheet) have shadows, but their components are different. These two kinds of shooting films, when they are mapped back in place, should have the same results in terms of color theory. Here, we can see that in terms of component coordination, two primary colors are more difficult than three primary colors, and in terms of shooting procedures, two primary colors are simpler than three primary colors. In any case, the fact that the Soviet Union shot two primary color films with such achievements this time cannot but be said to be quite successful and worthy of people's admiration.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Heroic Killing of ×× by the People of Qingyuan and Conghua</h3>
<p>— Ye Naibing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Battlefield Communication] This reporter would like to report in detail on the facts of the resistance against Japan by the people of Qingyuan and Conghua. Among the people of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, those of Qingyuan and Conghua are the most capable of exerting their power, fulfilling their duties, protecting their hometowns, and creating many moving and heroic historical facts.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese troops have followed up by occupying the southern section of Conghua, namely the southwest corner of Liuxi River (locally known as Conghua River), and the southern edge of Huaxian County. This remains the case to this day. However, the power of the Japanese troops has also extended to Qingyuan County in the north. Naturally, the Japanese troops have always wanted to attack the Yuehan Railway since they occupied Guangzhou. If the Japanese troops were to advance north, the Pajiang District of Qingyuan would bear the brunt. Qingyuan is located north of Conghua and Huaxian counties. The Yuehan Railway passes through its east, and the Pajiang District is located in the southeast of the county, precisely on the right side of the railway, about one hundred li from Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The people of Qingyuan are known for being strong and fierce, and they also possess a lot of weapons and artillery. Clan feuds are like national wars, with murder and destruction of villages being commonplace. However, when it comes to the critical moment of resistance against Japan, our people have turned the power of internal strife into attacking the Japanese invaders and defending their homes. As for the people of Conghua, because they are directly trampled upon by the violent Japanese and are also influenced by the news, they are equally brave and participate in the resistance, defending their homes and preventing the Japanese cavalry from trampling on the ancestral tombs of their ancestors.</p>
<p>The First Resistance</p>
<p>In late October last year, after the Japanese troops occupied the area south of Jiekou and Lu in Conghua County (Taipingchang, Shencui), they often appeared in the villages and towns of the Weigan Market area (more than ten li northwest of Conghua City, sixty to seventy li southeast of the Pajiang Estuary) along the Qingcong Highway, plundering property and forcibly seizing grain, pigs, and cattle. Later, they became accustomed to it and even ordered the villagers to bring a certain amount of grain, pigs, and cattle to the Jiekou furnace Japanese camp every day to be transported elsewhere by vehicles. They also declared that if they did not comply, they would set fire to the village and kill without mercy. Initially, the people in the Weigan area were powerless and had no choice but to swallow their anger. Who would have thought that the Japanese beasts would have no conscience and would gradually become even more unscrupulous, attempting to invade Qingyuan territory through Conghua? The people of Qingyuan certainly would not let it go, so they immediately rose up to resist.</p>
<p>On November 16th of last year, more than 70 Japanese soldiers, with two motorized bicycles as vanguards, invaded the area bordering Qingyuan from Conghua. There was a shallow river there. The Qingyuan Self-Defense Forces had already made preparations, ambushing sentries on the north bank of the river. When the Japanese troops reached a considerable distance, they immediately opened fire, killing two Japanese vanguards on the spot and seizing two automatic bicycles. The remaining Japanese troops knew that the people of Qingyuan would resist them and had killed their men, so they hurriedly retreated in disarray. Twelve members of the Self-Defense Forces were the bravest. They took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy all the way to the Weigan Market, more than fifteen li away, before returning. This was the first resistance of the people of Qingyuan. In this battle, we lost four men and wounded two, while the Japanese troops were wounded more than ten and the number of deaths was over twenty.</p>
<p>The Japanese ambition was not dead, and their desire for revenge was urgent. On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese sent threatening letters to the Weigan Market Station saying that they would definitely come to attack Qingyuan soon. I, as someone with no special skills, was not afraid, nor did I believe them. We only prepared for the Japanese invasion, vowing to resist to the death (to be continued)</p>

<p>But she did not reply, using the charming and elegant manners he taught her, she walked to the door.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Professor Higgins," she said crisply.</p>
<p>The laboratory in Wimpole Street sank into darkness. But Higgins' mood was even darker. He was in bitter recollection. He felt that he was really stupid and too selfish. He also felt infinite loneliness in his heart.</p>
<p>He stood up frustrated, turned on the desk lamp, and wanted to do something. He accidentally opened the button of the tape recorder. A harsh and unpleasant voice came from the quiet room: "I washed my face and hands when I came! Really!"</p>
<p>He excitedly turned off the button. But suddenly, at the doorway behind him, there was another beautiful and crisp voice, saying softly:</p>
<p>"I washed my face and hands when I came."</p>
<p>When he turned his head in surprise, he saw Eliza, and he hurriedly rushed to her side and kissed her repeatedly. (The End)</p>

<h3>Today's Jia Shan Charity Soccer Match: South China vs. All-Stars; Hou Rongsheng Joins South China and Will Play Today; Match Starts at 5 PM at Caroline Hill</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The South China Athletic Association's soccer team, which will travel to Southeast Asia, has changed its departure date to the 30th of this month. As a result, the charity match that was postponed due to rain last Saturday will finally be held today. The soccer connection is renewed, and fans will have a feast for their eyes. At that time, Caroline Hill will surely be full of excitement. This match is a contribution before South China's departure and is also the final chapter of the soccer season.</p>
<p>To advocate for compatriots, South China soccer players have always spared no effort. Now that they are about to travel to Southeast Asia, this practice match is a win-win situation. Furthermore, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the All-Stars team, this charity event will be completed, which is truly meritorious.</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng has joined the South China team and will travel with the team. Therefore, Hou Rongsheng's name appears in South China's lineup today. The defensive strength will also increase with Hou Rongsheng's presence. However, Hou Rongsheng was originally in the All-Stars' designated lineup. Now that he has switched sides, Li An'na will play out of position as the right inside midfielder. Li An'na occasionally played this position in the Hong Kong-Macau Interport Tournament a month ago and performed well. Playing it again today will likely be another good performance.</p>
<p>Although the All-Stars lineup is not perfectly complete, each player's skills are top-notch. If they can find a cooperative understanding during the match, the whole team will naturally have a wonderful performance. However, with Li An'na and Han Niweilu as inside midfielders, they are ultimately not used to it. Although they may try their best, it will still be difficult to avoid revealing weaknesses. The weakness of the whole team lies in this.</p>
<p>Center-back Nuo'er is a member of the Navy. The name is unfamiliar, but it is expected that he must have something to offer. Furthermore, with Xu Jingcheng and Xia Xian supporting him from the left and right, the midfield line should not be weak. However, the inside midfielders are ultimately unreliable. As the defenders' shield, they will inevitably struggle to look after both the front and the back. If the forward line can fully exert its power, it may reduce their worries about the rear.</p>
<p>South China, on the other hand, has formed a very ideal lineup, as if it were seamless. Although Liu Songsheng is used to being a midfielder, his ball-feeding skills are excellent, and he will be able to handle the responsibility of supplying the forward line. However, since he is responsible for supplying the ball, he must often attack. If he leaves his defensive position slightly vacant and gives others an opening, it will make Ai Rongsheng behind him too busy. However, Rongsheng has just joined the team and will definitely be very diligent. The busier he is, the more he will show his skills.</p>
<p>With Li Huitang as the commander of the forward line, and the assistance of getting into the game, the sharpness of the attack is expected to be beyond what the All-Stars' inside midfielders can withstand. Therefore, South China's victory is expected.</p>
<p>The match location is at Jia Shan, starting at 5:00 PM. Tickets are priced at one dollar, six dimes, and three dimes. The lineups of the two teams are listed below.</p>

<h3>Today's Baseball Game: South China vs. Youpi; Who Can Maintain Their Undefeated Status?</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] No matter what kind of career you engage in, diligence is essential. Look at the Youpi team, which is participating in this year's Open Baseball League. It was originally the North's Body of the unremarkable Volunteer Army. However, because they have been diligently practicing recently, their skills have greatly improved, and the team's overall coordination has become more meticulous. Therefore, since the beginning of the season, they have won both games and have suddenly gained the title of a strong team.</p>
<p>It was not surprising that Youpi defeated the Western Club in the previous game. The most commendable thing, however, was their match against Min Diannu. They controlled the entire game and made the evenly matched Min team lose their composure, winning by a score of nine to four. Because of this victory, they shifted the gaze of the general audience and marked them as the protagonist with the power to contend for the championship in this session.</p>
<p>Today is again the day for Youpi to take to the field, just as they are facing the South China Club, who have not yet dared to show their achievements. Therefore, in order to maintain their unbeaten status, the importance of this game is formed.</p>
<p>South China has only played once before, and they were facing the Western team, which is the weaker of the six teams, so their true strength was not fully demonstrated at that time. However, all the players are experienced veterans, and the team's coordination is also good.</p>
<p>Pitcher Li Zhongzhen is a veteran with skilled techniques and extraordinary methods. However, he is an older man with less stamina. If the weather is a little cooler, he can last up to seven innings. Otherwise, he will feel soft after pitching a maximum of five innings. Therefore, the question of whether South China will succeed or fail today depends on whether Li can support the pitch to the end.</p>
<p>Separating the two sides by talent, South China has more veterans, and its defense is better than its attack; Youpi has more newcomers, and its offense is better than its defense. Therefore, each has its own merits, and it is difficult to distinguish the high and low. Only when the end of the war arrives can we know the victory or defeat.</p>
<p>The game starts at 2:30 PM at the Caroline Hill Navy Stadium. Tickets are only five cents each, but there are not many seats, so to avoid missing out due to being full, you must arrive early. The lineups of the two teams are recorded as follows. (Stadium Grand Duke)</p>

<h3>Philippine Davis Cup Players Win All Matches in Shanghai: ...... Sanchez Defeats Carson ...... Umbon Defeats Li Guofan</h3>
<p>[Shanghai News, 22nd] Philippine Davis Cup players, Sanchez and Umbon, passed through Shanghai yesterday afternoon on their way to the United States to participate in the Davis Cup. The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club specially invited them to hold an exhibition match. There were a total of three singles and doubles matches, held at the French Chamber of Commerce hard court. Five to six hundred Chinese and Western spectators watched. As a result, the Philippine players won all three singles and doubles matches. Although the two players do not have particularly profound skills, they are young and strong, and their future achievements are immeasurable. It was particularly difficult for Sanchez to defeat Carson. The performance results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tang Baojia 6-4 Forbes</p>
<p>Cai Guoji 9-7 Cola Sha</p>
<p>(2) Umbon 6-3 6-1 Li Guofan</p>
<p>(3) Sanchez 2-6 6-1 8-6 Carson</p>
<p>(4) Sanchez Umbon 8-6 3-6 6-3 Carson Shi Guiya</p>
<p>Young and Strong, Excellent Skills</p>
<p>The two men are not surprising in appearance. Umbon is especially thin and small like a child. It was thought that he must not be Li Guofan's enemy. Who knew that he was in great physical condition and shot the ball steadily. Li's failure lies in the fact that his physical strength is not as good, and he is not as steady. In the first few games, they were still able to counter each other. After entering, Li was exhausted and completely panicked. He repeatedly touched the net and flew wildly. Umbon was still able to counter the two corners calmly, plus the overhead air pressure. In the first set, after three pairs of three, he fell sharply and the situation changed suddenly. In the second set, Li only scored the second game. In the battle between Shan and Carson, Carson galloped across the field at the beginning, winning 2-6 very easily. In the second set, Carson was already showing signs of fatigue and was not running fast. Probably because the season had just begun. Arguing that Carson was better than Sanchez in art, overhead cut, and slash, Shan was indeed not as good. But in the end, the hoarse exhausted was no match for the youth who was rising like the morning sun.</p>
<p>Carson is Experienced, but His Endurance is Not Good</p>
<p>In the second set, Carson gave up. In the third set, Sanchez became more and more courageous. His forehand counter-punch was indeed a wonderful performance. Carson was already unable to shoot the ball and was barely coping. After 4-2, Carson reluctantly chased to a tie. Sanchez saved the ball in the tenth game, lost the last winning point, and Carson chased again to tie each other by 5 and then took the lead by 6-5, but in the end he could not resist Sanchez's fierce draw and lost three games in a row. In the end, Carson had no intention of fighting in doubles. Shi Guiya's wild ball was seen repeatedly, and there were not many highlights. The two Philippine youths were still full of energy. Sanchez's style is quite similar to Qiu Feihai, with an excellent forehand and a weak backhand. He hasn't shown other strengths yet. The two are at a young age and will be future stars in the East.</p>

<h3>The Post-War Situation of Cotton Mills: Concentrated in Shanghai, with Raw Materials Monopolized; Relying on Imported Cotton for Relief</h3>
<p>Following the fall of coastal cities after the war, cotton mills suffered severe damage. Factories refused to cooperate with the [Japanese] side and established new mills in the Shanghai International Settlement. Ten mills, including Xinsheng, have already completed construction and commenced operations. However, due to the [Japanese] monopolization of raw materials, they were forced to order imported cotton for relief. Detailed information is provided below.</p>
<p>Shanghai: A Gathering Place for Cotton Mills</p>
<p>The distribution of China's textile industry concentrated in coastal cities before the war, with Jiangsu province taking the lead due to its long history. This was attributed to its suitable terrain and climate, convenient transportation, active financial sector, and excellent market conditions, making its progress unmatched by other provinces. Out of a total of 148 mills nationwide, Jiangsu province had 88, accounting for 59.5% of the total. Shanghai stood out as the most developed city, leading the nation's cotton mill industry, with 65 mills, accounting for 73.9% of the province's total. Among these, 31 were Chinese-owned, 30 were [Japanese]-owned, and 4 were British-owned. Therefore, it was not only a gathering place for Chinese cotton mills but also a center for foreign cotton mills.</p>
<p>[Japanese] Forces Take Over Mills in War Zones</p>
<p>Following the fall of coastal cities after the war, most of the cotton mills in the war zones were destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that survived had incomplete internal machinery. At the same time, the [Japanese] side attempted to take over by force, making any recovery impossible. However, Zhenhua Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, with 13,928 spindles, was leased to Heji through the efforts of You Jusun of the "Citizens' Association" and was allowed to continue production as usual with [Japanese] approval. Factories within the war zones that were taken over and put back into operation by the [Japanese] side included Shenxin and Shui'an mills. However, these had no connection to the original factories and were entirely due to the [Japanese] side's illegal takeover and operation. Some of these factories had foreign interests, which the [Japanese] side disregarded despite ineffective negotiations.</p>
<p>Ten New Mills Commence Operations in the International Settlement</p>
<p>All cotton mills within the occupied areas resolutely refused to cooperate with the [Japanese] side, willing to sacrifice business and instead establish new mills in the Shanghai International Settlement. However, most were established under the names of foreign merchants, such as British and American companies. According to a survey conducted by a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the following have commenced operations: (1) Xinhe with 25,000 spindles, (2) Xieji with 2,600 spindles, (3) Anda with 15,000 spindles, (4) Taifeng with 15,000 spindles, (5) Xinsheng with 16,000 spindles, (6) Qixing with 6,000 spindles, (7) Rongfeng with 15,000 spindles, (8) Zhongfang with 20,000 spindles, (9) Defeng with 8,300 spindles, and (10) Baofeng with 10,000 spindles. Among these, Xinsheng and Xieji are entirely Chinese-owned.</p>
<p>Existing Mills in Operation: Spindle Count</p>
<p>The existing factories in the Shanghai International Settlement that were in operation before the war, with their spindle counts, are as follows: (1) Shenxin Second Textile Mill with 56,000 spindles, (2) Shenxin Ninth Textile Mill with 89,000 spindles, (3) Xinyu First Mill with 25,000 spindles, (4) Xinyu Second Mill with 24,000 spindles, (5) Hongzhang with 24,000 spindles, (6) Yongan Third Mill with 63,000 spindles, (7) Datong Cotton Mill with 4,700 spindles, (8) Tongyi Textile Mill with 47,000 spindles, (9) Qinfeng Textile Mill with 4,300 spindles, and (10) Chongxin Textile Mill with 34,000 spindles. Chongxin and Tongyi are registered under British companies, and Shenxin Second Mill is managed by an American enterprise.</p>
<p>[Japanese]-Owned Mills in Shanghai</p>
<p>The [Japanese]-owned mills in Shanghai that are already in operation include: (1) Rihua Textile Mill Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh, with a total of 174,816 spindles and 42,296 doubling spindles, (2) Naigaiwata Cotton Mill Company First to Ninth, with a total of 280,536 spindles, 111,880 doubling spindles, and 3,800 looms, (3) Shanghai Spinning Company First, Second, and Third, with a total of 119,024 spindles, 23,320 doubling spindles, and 2,304 looms, (4) Tongxing Textile Company with 97,000 spindles, 30,140 doubling spindles, and 1,412 looms, (5) Gongda, Donghua, Youkang, and Shenyu companies with a total of 441,940 spindles, 8,200 doubling spindles, and 7,000 looms.</p>
<p>British Jardine, Lun Chang Factories</p>
<p>The existing British-owned factories in Shanghai have now fully resumed operations: (1) Jardine Textile Corporation, Jardine Public Welfare Yangshupu with 40,976 spindles and 2,135 looms, (2) Lun Chang Textile Dyeing and Printing Co., Ltd. with 3,640 spindles and 1,130 looms. Among the British-owned spinning factories, only Public Welfare produces yarn, but its yarn production is insufficient for the weaving needs of the other three factories, requiring the purchase of yarn from Chinese and [Japanese] mills. As for Lun Chang Textile Company, it is reported to have installed 44,000 spindles and is making every effort to expand to implement a policy of self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-dyeing. Currently, British yarn circulating on the market is produced by Chongxin, Tongyi, and newly established mills such as Xinhe and Anda.</p>
<p>Monopolization of Raw Materials, Ordering Imported Cotton</p>
<p>Japan is using all its strength to collect cotton from occupied areas in China and transport it to Japan as raw materials for industrial and military supplies. As a result, the quantity of cotton exported to Japan has increased sharply. Last year, the value of cotton exports was 10,100,003,224 national currency units. In the first quarter of this year, the value of cotton exports was 3,527,021 national currency units. Shanghai cotton mills are facing a shortage of raw materials due to the [Japanese] monopoly of cotton, forcing them to order imported cotton from places like Egypt, the United States, and Brazil for relief. Last year, the total value of cotton imports was 12,735,044 national currency units. In the first quarter of this year, cotton imports increased to 26,579,113 national currency units.</p>
<p>[Japanese] Attempt to Monopolize the Yarn Industry</p>
<p>Due to the surge in newly established cotton mills in Shanghai after the war, it remains a gathering place for Chinese and foreign cotton mills. Increases in yarn prices are based on the Shanghai market as the standard. The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange is facing difficult circumstances and has no hope of resuming trading. However, the [Japanese] side has organized a cotton exchange at the old site of the precious metals exchange on Second Avenue, with plans to open on July 1st. As for yarn sales, the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and North China provinces are monopolized by [Japanese] yarn, and Chinese yarn is almost non-existent. The sales areas for Chinese yarn are the southwest provinces and non-occupied areas. Even yarn sales in Shanghai are being seized by [Japanese] yarn because [Japanese] yarn prices are lower than Chinese yarn prices.</p>

<h3>Country Living in Shatin</h3>
<p>— Xitang</p>
<p>That small, powder-blue building at the foot of To Fung Shan was once my home, and it will forever linger in my dreamlike memories of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The [Japanese]'s massacre forced me to leave my home and suffer the hardships of displacement. However, in Shatin, I found rest.</p>
<p>Shatin has clear, blue skies, lush green mountains, majestic peaks, azure seas, clear sandy streams, dense green trees, strong, resilient pines, elegant bamboo, and charming wildflowers. The scenery is beautiful, peaceful, and quiet, like a poem, a dream, a painting. I especially love the mountain of Han Mu and the turbulent sea. When the wind rises, I can hear the mountain breeze, the sea breeze, the waves, and the pine groves, all joining in a solemn and magnificent symphony.</p>
<p>Morning, noon, evening, and night, the colors are different, and what unfolds before my eyes is not a static picture but a constantly changing kaleidoscope. As the sun rises and sets, the moon waxes and wanes, the clouds paint myriad colors, and the sea changes in an instant.</p>
<p>The most magical and magnificent scenes are at dawn and dusk. At dawn, the mountains, the hills, the green fields, the shores, are shrouded in a misty morning fog. The morning mist is like a soft, shimmering curtain, or a light, sparse pearl veil. Everything shrouded within is hazy and indistinct, appearing and disappearing. This scene is like an ancient beauty from a foreign land wearing a veil. Her charm and allure inspire admiration and longing, yet she remains unattainable.</p>
<p>At dusk, the red sun sets in the west, the oblique rays reflect, and the sky is filled with colorful clouds, dazzling and vibrant. You feel as if you are seeing a rainbow dress or a tapestry embroidered with a hundred flowers. Sometimes I seem to see the handsome and dignified sun god Apollo driving his powerful, snow-white steeds, speeding home. The sea also reflects these colors, transforming into another enchanting realm. I then believe that there is indeed a crystal palace decorated with coral and jade trees beneath the sea. I seem to hear the celestial music of the sea playing in unison and faintly see the sea goddess gracefully walking on the waves. I look forward to the appearance of a mermaid, and I even hope to hear the enchanting and captivating voice of the Siren coming from the sea.</p>
<p>As for the mountain scenery at dusk, the solemn and silent mountains are like monks. At this moment, they also become lively. The night envelops them, and the setting sun also reflects on them, so these mountains are no longer just monotonous green or dark green. They are sometimes crimson, sometimes lavender, sometimes turning blue, or sometimes slightly black, and gradually deepening to a dark black.</p>
<p>These majestic, magnificent, and magical scenes can only be painted by the glory of the Creator and cannot be depicted by ordinary people. I can only be amazed, focused, and joyfully appreciate the greatness of creation!</p>
<p>Sometimes I walk up To Fung Shan, where there is a grassy slope like velvet. I like to watch the sunset there, admire the dawn colors of the sea and mountains. I especially like to lie on the grass, watching the sky slowly darken, watching all the colors gradually fade, listening to all the sounds slowly disappear. If it is a moonlit night, when everything on the ground turns dark, the moonlight shines brightly, the sky is like jade, and the clouds are as white as snow, then I feel ethereal, as if I want to "ascend to heaven."</p>
<p>If it is a starry night, when everything on the ground turns dark, you can see countless stars twinkling in the quiet sky. Because I am high on the mountain, the sky seems particularly low, as if it is tightly covering the mountain. Thus, the distance between me and the sky is so close that I can reach out and touch the stars, and I seem to hear the stars whispering. Although the night is cold, I feel like I am wrapped in a soft cloud gauze. In this way, in the silence and in the embrace of the mountains, I become one with nature.</p>
<p>Although I cannot help but feel sad and angry when I think of my home, I never feel like I have left my country or become depressed and dejected. Because my home is not far away, if I want to, I can get home in three hours. Moreover, there are three express trains every day, each bringing news from Guangzhou. When I see visitors from Guangzhou on the train, I feel comforted and friendly because they have safely escaped the danger.</p>
<p>The impermanence of life and the sudden changes in the world sometimes stir up light sorrow, but the dreamlike mist and the beautiful scenery are enough to cleanse away worldly thoughts and worries, giving people a transcendent and detached sadness.</p>
<p>However, I do not forget the smoke and flames of war in my motherland. In the early morning, when I hear a few bars of the Soviet Union's marching music, I feel as if I am experiencing the battle calls of our front lines. When I see the lines of British soldiers marching in front of my building and see their frequent military movements, I think of the busy activities of our brave soldiers on the front lines. Or, at night, when I see the searchlight exercises of To Fung Shan's anti-aircraft defenses and see the enemy planes in the dark being illuminated by searchlights like demons that cannot escape, I feel a renewed sense of excitement, and my longing for my motherland deepens.</p>
<p>Every time when the night is quiet and the waves crash against the shore, in the symphony of the sad sea breeze and mountain breeze, I take out my stand and stand before it, facing the benevolent sky, facing the understanding stars, facing the quiet mountains, facing the solemn sea, and sincerely pray for my motherland!</p>
<h3>Satisfied</h3>
<p>— By Fory the</p>
<p>I hope you are happy, Mr. Chamberlain, Franco, Hitler, and Mussolini have formed a gang. The cannons of fascism, which you painstakingly supplied, are now practicing in Gibraltar. At the same time, the cries of Spain, which once appealed to you for justice, have subsided in the roaring whirlwind of propaganda.</p>
<p>You are also happy, Mr. Daladier! To break Franco at the axis is a dream, you must know.</p>
<p>The masses should be happy, children of the British Empire! There is no need to worry about the death and destruction of a loyal and helpless nation. Franco can be bought with imperial money, okay. I hope that the dying struggles of Catalonia and the cries of the children of Barcelona have not disturbed the respectful thoughts of the imperial people.</p>
<p>Are you satisfied? Honorable members of parliament! You always say that Spain is a communist country, deservedly unable to get help.</p>
<p>You must be satisfied, isolationist sirs! You put on the cloak of neutrality laws—helping the aggressor, strangling democratic forces.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all intelligent and kind gentlemen! You think the Spanish war is just "a domestic squabble," a family quarrel should be more fun, yes, one million Spaniards died for you, and another fascist country was born in Europe.</p>
<p>Can you hear the ghostly, piercing cries?</p>
<p>This is the cry of the nation sacrificed for democracy, sold out by the people who shout democracy, who bound their hands and helped their enemies.</p>
<p>So many orphans are wandering to every corner of the world.</p>
<p>So many innocent refugees are living in France.</p>
<p>Can you hear the tragic cries of the Spanish people? They fought for democracy and died without help.</p>
<p>I hope:</p>
<p>You will never fear those who are next to you in Spain:</p>
<p>The Spanish monster created by the help of your countries is very satisfying;</p>
<p>In the future struggle between democracy and fascism, you remember Spain!</p>
<p>May you always be happy! (Translated by Bao De)</p>
<h3>My Memories</h3>
<p>— Yu Saifu</p>
<p>I love the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>In my childhood, on the Yangtze River's current, a steamboat carried me to various ports.</p>
<p>My father's rough voice—</p>
<p>He was teaching me, and pointing at the splashing waves and the playful boatmen.</p>
<p>He said: "Live like this!"—</p>
<p>How white are the waves on the Yangtze River. The green groves, mountains, and damp villages on both banks…</p>
<p>But there were wrinkles on my father's old face, some shadows of hatred. He was no longer young and strong. His spirit was only sinking into the abyss of suffering.</p>
<p>The ship's engines roared endlessly, day and night. Our Yangtze River was in turmoil.</p>
<p>Last year, on the banks of the Yangtze River, we saw [Japanese] warships spewing thick, black, bloody smoke, sailing without any regard.</p>
<p>Last year, on the banks of the Yangtze River, we saw [Japanese] warships sunk by our planes. That was a heroic act under the starry night.</p>
<p>We heard the noisy sounds on the warships. We saw the warships, emitting smoke…</p>
<p>Last year, on the banks of the Yangtze River, I was no longer empty-handed. In our hands, we tightly gripped weapons.</p>
<p>And my old father? His rough voice:</p>
<p>"Live like this!"</p>
<p>This voice, passed through the lonely villages, and at night, the waves of the Yangtze River roared with an angry sound.</p>
<p>"Why is it so restless?" a young comrade asked me.</p>
<p>Looking at the milky-white moon in the sky, I said:</p>
<p>"It is not restless. It wants to rise up in resistance, just like us… because it is Chinese."</p>
<p>We did not continue the conversation.</p>
<p>My old father no longer accompanies me on my wanderings. As for him? I do not know his whereabouts. He will be at ease because he understands how to "live like this."</p>
<p>The waves of planes and the steel boatmen…</p>
<p>How can we forget? Our beautiful Yangtze River is now being trampled upon by the [Japanese].</p>
<h3>On the Way Home (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Li</p>
<p>Having shaken hands with my dear comrades, dear brothers, I changed into civilian clothes and, with an excited heart, set out on the road from the guerrilla area to the occupied area.</p>
<p>Carrying a small bundle on my back, I walked silently through the rural fields. Before me, the morning sun cast a dazzling light.</p>
<p>Far away on the side where the sun rose, there was my hometown, which had already fallen, with my father and younger brother. Straining my eyes to look at that horizon, a heart that had been aching for so long seemed to be tightly gripped by a powerful hand. My steps quickened on the road, which was still wet with night dew.</p>
<p>Hometown! Father! Brother!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, I had been separated from them for over a year! In the year or so of separation, we had lost contact.</p>
<p>—In this year or so, was my occupied hometown safe? During this year or so, were my father and younger brother still alive?</p>
<p>This longing, which had been lingering in my heart for so long, was now urgently awakened.</p>
<p>Confused thoughts dominated my entire mind. My legs seemed to be walking at someone else's command. A small stone tripped my foot, and I finally woke up.</p>
<p>I turned back to look at the side where my comrades, brothers, and heroic sons and daughters of my country were. I felt an infinite reluctance to part. I also looked at the three peaks of Maoshan in front of the blue sky. Thin, light clouds were floating above the peaks.</p>
<p>—Maoshan! Goodbye! Goodbye! Maoshan—I whispered to myself and nodded to it silently.</p>
<p>Then I turned back to face the dazzling sun and strode forward.</p>
<p>In the evening, I arrived at a village and rested my tired feet at a farmer's house, spending the night there.</p>
<p>In the morning, I carried my small bundle on my back and continued my journey. But when I reached about one-third of a mile away from the highway, several gunshots suddenly rang out in front of me, and I had to stop. Then, the sound of rifles and machine guns burst out in succession. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>An Admonition to Literary Youths with Old Hobbies</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>It has long been said that although China lags behind in science in the modern world, resulting in a material civilization that falls behind others, its philosophy and literature possess unique strengths, surpassing all countries in spiritual civilization. Therefore, scholars of national essence stubbornly cling to many thread-bound fragments, refusing to let go, regarding them as secret treasures within their pillows, appreciating them, studying them, imitating them endlessly, and also desperately promoting them, urging younger generations to follow their path, everyone to appreciate, to study, to imitate. The majority of middle school Chinese language teachers inevitably do this, and almost all university Chinese language professors are like this. Let us carefully consider, is this really right?</p>
<p>Whether our philosophy and literature surpass those of all other countries is too big a question to discuss now. Even if our philosophy and literature do possess unique strengths, should all young students appreciate, study, and imitate them? I think anyone who knows what a country, especially our country now, needs would not say yes. Of course, for young people who have a special fondness for and talent in this kind of philosophy and literature, they may appreciate, study, and imitate it, but it is definitely not something everyone should do.</p>
<p>Now, we don't have time to talk about philosophy, so let's talk about literature. I only see many literary youths with this hobby, they like to write classical Chinese, and the more incomprehensible it is, the more they want to write, their purpose is not to learn, but to show off, to show that they have knowledge. Even when they can write fluently, they still write regardless of time, place, or need. They like to compose poetry, seven-character and five-character verses, with alternating tones. They don't care whether the poetry is good or not, they just claim to be refined. They also like to use literary allusions in their speech, saying "however," "therefore," "zhi," "hu," "zhe," "ye," regardless of whether it's appropriate, always inserting a few into every sentence to show that they are authentic literati. Worse still, they still cannot shake off the idea of talented scholars and beautiful women, writing flowery love letters and romances, or filling pages with ornate and frivolous poems and lyrics. At school, they embrace the "dogmatic" approach to medicine. In society, they adopt a procrastinating attitude towards work. In their family life, they consider themselves noble for not engaging in household production. If anyone says they shouldn't be like this, they will be given a disdainful look and denounced as vulgar. If they have family wealth, they will surely squander it. If they don't have family wealth, they will surely be in dire straits. Yet they do not regret it, nor do they change. They always use the saying "a gentleman endures poverty" and "poets excel in poverty" to console themselves.</p>
<p>Seeing such young people, I feel pained, so I want to use my sincere wishes to tell them a few words:</p>
<p>In this era, especially in China now, it is best if you do not indulge in literature, because literature is not the most urgent necessity, especially do not indulge in old literature, because most of what is in literature is just: discouraging words, decadent words, empty dreams, illusions, meaningless loyalty, pretentiousness, and groaning without illness... These are opium, alcohol, any harmful intoxicants.</p>
<p>If you already know the harm of this kind of old literature, but cannot quit it for a while, then I advise you to just appreciate it, and use it as entertainment in your spare time. But do not go further and engage in research. If you have the spirit of research, I would rather you study subjects that are of practical use to modern times, especially to our country, rather than studying this old literature.</p>
<p>To take a further step back, if you do have a true fondness for this kind of old literature, and indeed have a special talent for it, and you must engage in research, then go ahead and research it. It is not bad to research and find some clues and some practical results, but you must never engage in imitation. Because even if the imitation is good, it is just a fake antique, and if it is not good, it is even more of a joke. And eight or nine times out of ten, the imitation is not good, so why bother to do something futile and unnecessary?</p>
<p>Finally, if you are already addicted to imitating this kind of old literature, I still advise you to imitate as little as possible. This kind of thing is fundamentally useless, and it is really only good for covering jars, and it inevitably has a bad influence on others. Don't adopt the demeanor of old-fashioned literati just because you are good at imitating this kind of thing. In the past, courtesans would scold scholars as being only worth a few coins per pound. Now, I'm afraid they are not only worthless, but people will cover their noses and walk past you when they see your affected air! If your writing skills are already very solid, it is better to write more new-style creations that are relevant to the times.</p>
<p>What I am saying is indeed untimely, and perhaps some people will scold me for not understanding old literature and therefore making superficial remarks to insult old literature. I will not defend myself. I am willing to accept such scolding. But what I truly feel is dangerous, and I must speak out. I do not want to see good young people get on the wrong train and travel back thousands of years, wasting their lives and ruining the important affairs of the country. I hope that every one of them can embark on the grand road of modernization!</p>
<p>At the same time, I also hope that the majority of middle school Chinese language teachers and almost all university Chinese language professors will not excessively promote this kind of old literature, and will clearly distinguish between appreciation, research, and imitation. Even if they do promote it, they should do so with the aim of being practically useful to both themselves and the country.</p>
