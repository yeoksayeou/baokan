<h3>職業與智識</h3>
<p>— 章榆梅</p>
<p>—貢獻給商店小職員學徒們—</p>
<p>爲着各人家庭環境的不同，一般幸運者到達了你們同等的年齡，有的由小學進中學，或由中學進大學，過着他們可寶貴的舉校生活，可是你們呢，却爲着家庭負担不起這貴挨式的學校費用，而在商店中充一員小職員或學徒，我相信你們具有很强的求知慾，同時曉得你們底智識程度是不會超過高小敎育的，因此我曉得在你們中問，一定有着不少爲若不能滿足求知的慾望，而對於職業感到憎惡甚至爲着求智慾過份旺盛，因此而趨於消極，這　筆者謹希望商店職員並學徒們，不必爲着環境不允許你們高强的求知慾，而消極或憎惡職業而荒廢你們寶貴的前途。</p>
<p>職業與智識原是絕對不能分難的，可是現在大多數腦筋頑固的商賈，以爲一個人在小時應該求智識，假使一踏進商店之門就不應該再談什麽智識，祇須在商業上用腦筋。這樣便產生現在商店中就業不得求知的現象，爲了這，不知　送了多少有作爲的靑年人，這完全是他們不明白智識對於職業的重要。暨如說，一個人沒有高尚的智能，當然得不到較好的職業；同樣的，假使連小學程度都沒有，使他來充商店的職員是不可能的，同時國家的變遷，社會的動態，都能影響到商業的發展，都需要憑觀察力去判斷；而觀察力的產生，大多是以你們的智識爲定。此外每個人的思想行爲，也可因此得到正確底指示，所以智識與職業，是分離不開的。</p>
<p>在目前，尤其在舊式商店中，業餘固然談不上，要想以三五價鐘點的時間來自修你們應用的智識，確實也是困難；可是我希室憑着你們個人的毅力與求智的決心，以誠懇態度。儘量地去說服　們的經理們。萬一不能得到相當的時間，也應當在早晨規定起身時間前抽出一二鐘點來，這我想大概可能的，只要你們有決心，肯不斷努力用功將來一定有希望的日子。試看王雲五先生，地有今日在文化界地位，也是由不斷自修而獲得的，所以你們切忌不要爲環境所屈服。</p>
<p>最後，筆者以至誠態度來介紹一本切台你們實際的刊物——目修週刊它內容有國英文常識簿記等多種，可說是業餘良好的進修讀物。當然全民抗戰，讀書月報等、更是你們很好的新讀物。</p>
<p>現代青年　蔡元培題　（第二期）</p>
<h3>青年運動與民族解放</h3>
<p>— 馬力</p>
<p>中國的靑年運動，都以民旗解放鬥爭的姿態而出現、並不是偶然的；這芷說明了中國的靑年問題只是民族問題的一瓊，而爭取民族解放是解決靑年苦悶的前提。</p>
<p>歷年來，中國爲了受着侵掠者直接的壓迫，剝榨。以至於奪佔，和它通過殘餘的封建勢力而所加上的箝制，使得中國的靑年們在思想上，活動上，戀愛上，職業上，甚至於在根本的生活上，不但沒有正當的保障而且被剝奪了應有的自由權利。</p>
<p>我們中國的靑年是曾經苦悶過來了，而這苦悶的根源是由於侵略者步步進逼。他們由於苦悶，於是憤慨，由於憤慨，於是起而抗爭，抗爭的目的，是爲建立自由獨立的民主共和國，以消除苦悶，探求出路；抗爭的對象，無疑的是侵略者和被它所利用的封建勢力。</p>
<p>所以，中國的靑年運動，是必然地和反侵掠，反封建的民族解放運動相聯擊着而且膠結着的。</p>
<p>從一九一九的「五·四」，一九二五的「五·卅」，一直到一九三五的「一二·九」「一二。一六」，無論其發展爲新文化運動，爲國民革命，爲團結抗戰；而其發端是爲了反抗侵略國家的壓迫，其本質是參透民埃抗爭的意義，都是相　的。</p>
<p>在處於被壓迫，被侵掠的半殖民地的境遇下的中國不但是靑年們感受了無比的苦悶，全國的大衆都領嘗着無比的慘痛，這是非常明顯的事業。但是由於靑年們感覺敏銳，情緒熱烈，意志堅强，認識清楚，以及他們所特具的健壯的心身和優越的地位，所以他們總是站在民埃解放鬥爭的最前列，每次做了先知先覽的前哨戰士而吶喊着，領導着，而且戰鬥着。</p>
<p>我國這一次的全面抗戰，其爆發的因素固　很多，但我們應當確認在歷年來靑年運動的累積所起的作用，尤其是十二月運動中所作反侵略，反漢奸，反分裂，反傀儡等英勇的鬥爭所起的作用這種作用正在今日的抗戰中潛蓄着而且發展着，許多的靑年已經跑上了前綫去參戰，許多的靑年是在各地幹着宣傳，組織，募捐，慰勞等等的實際工作。</p>
<p>囘頭看看這裏的靑年怎樣呢？一部份是過　燈紅酒綠的享樂生活，一部份是爲了一紙文憑而學院式地讀着死書，也有一部份是因爲不能到內地或前線去轟轟烈烈地幹一下而焦虜喪氣，真正能夠認清現實　埋頭苦幹着的，所餘無幾，他們又要這裏做，又要那裏做，夜以繼畫，精疲力盡，這實在是很可憾的。</p>
<p>加緊自我敎育罷，靑年朋友們—站起來發揮那同輩捫所造成的光榮的歷史：不要貪求一時的刺激與興奮，而要把每處立脚地都當做前綫，艱苦地在當前的環境下　踏實地担負起自己的任務，有一分力發一分光地爲民族國家的燦爛的前途而奮鬥能！</p>
<p>等到我國民族解放的戰鬥撤底勝利以後，靑年問題定將一環　地解決；而我全中國的靑年這才能够過合理而理想的生活！</p>
<h3>世界科學消息　兒童電話局</h3>
<p>英斯科「文化與休養中央公園」中設有電話局一所，一切工作均由兒童担任，共有線路八十條，連接於該公園內兒童農村中之各房屋及各機關，另有電話收話器二十五架設置于農　之各處，每處代表一個外國之　名城市。其用意在于健兒童利用電話，任國際通話，而與某國通話時，卽用某國言語。任聯于電話局者爲五十個阿基米得他會之幹練會員，該學會專爲靑年發明家而設。（蘇聯年報社，旦）</p>
<h3>無線電燈</h3>
<p>法國人柯斯得爾發明用無綫電波點燈，最近業已取得專利權，此種新式燈泡爲球形，並無燈赫，內部係眞空而塗以發燐光或其他發光之粉狀化學品。當被高頻率電波所激發時，卽發出明亮之光。使用時以之縣於一條線（金屬線）上，此線卽用作一　型無線電發送站之天線。由此吾人預測將來或可用此種燈泡以照明街道及住宅。用以照明街道時，所用之天線卽以單根線充之，而以之照明室內時，則可以平行或成扇形之線作天線。（紐約時報，旦）</p>
<h3>幾個模範兒童</h3>
<p>— 薇</p>
<p>中國在怒吼着，中國的兒童們也在怒吼。</p>
<p>下面所記的，是抗戰期中幾個模　兒童的故事</p>
<p>一，向四百孤軍献旗的女童子軍，楊惠敏，楊惠敏是一個勇敢的女童子軍，當前年十月末，我軍自淞滬區撤退時四百壯士留駐在蘇州河邊的四行倉庫裏，誓願拚最後一滴血，向侵略者索取應付的代價。楊惠敏冒了萬險，將一面國旗送進倉庫，戲與忠勇衛國的四百孤軍。在烟火瀰漫，四周全是×旗的閘北最後陣地上，我四行倉庫的頂上，竟飄起燦爛奪目的靑天白日滿地紅國旗，表示我軍還堅守閘北，發揚我偉大的中華魂！</p>
<p>二，愛多亞路一童軍在『八一三』開戰後某天，上海愛多亞路羣業圍毆「漢奸」，當時恰巧被一個童子軍所見，他立見破衆而入，將「漢奸」一把抱住，羣衆才停止了毆打，『漢奸』由竄子軍　入捕房，查明毫無罪嫌並非漢奸，也終算沒有受傷。那個人和他的家屬，對該童子軍救他出　，都感激涕零，認爲救命恩人。</p>
<p>三，刷　童子吳威守—吳威守是廣州一個剴鞋童子。當廣州舉行獻金運動時，他終日在獻金台前，爲獻金人和觀衆刷鞋，隨時把所得報酬獻交台上，他一共刷了一百八十五次，總共得洋二十多元。他每獻一次，便得到獻金還一枚。對傍晚時，他的衣襟上已全被獻金證掛滿了。</p>
<p>四，西康小學生敲瓦子獻金—西康會理縣城外，正在修築馬路，當地第四初級小學全體小學生，就去替大人們敲瓦子，共得到十六塊錢的報酬。他捫就把這筆錢，寄到國民政府行政院，充作救國捐並附了一封慰勞前綫將十們的信。</p>
<p>五，絕食勸父的潘必正—潘必正是一個十七歲的廣東少年，他的父親是一個富翁。廣州淪陷後，潘必止心中十分悲憤，他就請求父親將在存外國銀行裏的存款購存國家銀行：並以四百萬元捐獻政府。他的父親不允許他便實行絕食，以促父親的覺悟。後來，潘必正終於達到了他救國的目的。</p>
<p>六，在前線担任救護工作的馬舒—馬針是中國童子軍戰時服務第一團第四直轄隊的大隊長，他率領了四十個團員，在戰綫服務，出生入死，艱苦萬分，在江西馬迴激戰時，他們冒着×人的毒氣，每天祇吃　芋頭，仍奮勇地做他們救　傷兵的工作。我國童子軍在這次抗戰中，為國效勞建樹了偉大的功績，以上所記的馬舒君，祗是共中的一例罷了，據中國童軍協會宣稱，自戰事發生以來，中國童子軍有三十五萬名在前綫或後方服務，其中有一萬名，並且在前綫助戰。</p>
<p>「對於個是不能求「和」的！」</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>略論目前的戰局</h3>
<p>目前的戰局，其主要的特點：</p>
<p>在我國方面，是要在與×相持中，加緊×人後方的游擊戰鬥和加緊未來實施『戰略反攻』的準備，俗以求早日實現消滅及驅逐日×出中國，把我們靑天白天的旗幟，插到鴨綠江頭！</p>
<p>在日×方面，它們今日的作戰，主要的是配合政治的和經濟的進攻，造成一個「不戰不和」的局面，以便加緊鞏固其佔領地區的統治力量，利用我們佔領地區的人力財力物力，精極佈置，「完全征服中國進而獨霸亞東」。因此它們今日在軍事的要求是實現「以戰養戰」。</p>
<p>自從廣州武漢棄守以後，前期抗戰即吿結束，日×的戰略便走向上述方向，而攻陷南昌　來這幾個月的事實，更證明日×軍事上的企圖是在於「以戰養戰」，也就是因爲日×在侵華軍事上已經遭遇到重大的困難與　遏，日×的戰　力量已經遭遇大大的削弱與消耗，不能不開始採取退守的步驟了！</p>
<p>不過日×的軍隊，還是具有最近的現代化裝備與配備的軍隊，它具有極大的幾動的性能；並且又保有若干較大的城市，控制着幾條大的鐵路交通綫，因此，它雖然不得不採取退守補充的戰略，仍有可能以跳躍的方式，揀選在它們認爲弱點的地方，以及認爲我軍運動作戰與增援接濟不良的地方，實行猛烈的進攻，加以『確實的佔領』，再休養一下，我尋第二個目標。進攻南昌是爲此，包圍大洪山，七攻中條山，以至最近之在汕頭定海等地登陸，亦莫不爲此。</p>
<p>無論爲進攻山西作犯陝狀態，無論爲騷擾我浙閩粵沿海，×日目前的進攻，可說是具有同一的企圖的，卽在企圖阻止前綫我軍之向×人佔領區實施反攻，卽在企圖撲滅我在華北華中華東南破壞×軍後方的游擊隊，卽在企圖藉以强化佔領地區×僞政權的統治力，卽在企圖藉以加强其對沾領地區的文化麻醉與經濟刦奪，即在藉以破壞與刦奪歐美列强在華勢力及掠奪東南沿海折閩粵一省的對外貿易利益，總之一句話：亦卽在企圖實現其「就地征粮，自求補充」的『以戰養戰」的侵華新陰謀。</p>
<p>日×這種「以戰養戰』及極力造成『不戰不和」的企圖，同時還有一種更惡毒的陰謀，卽是在　跳躍戰的「勝利」來刺戟其國內人民，和麻痺我國抗戰的情緒，即是在以『和平』『反共』等口號來誘引我若工動搖份子和頑固份子，來分化我全國的團結，陂壞蔣委員長領導的『主動的持久的全面的抗戰』，卽是在以胃險嚇詐的手段來威逼×國放棄援華政策與日×妥協合作逼我屈服，再進而實現其「獨霸世界之初步』的建立『東亞新秩序』！</p>
<p>由於我們全國的團結，政治的進步，與國際信譽的提高，由於我們前線戰鬥力的加强，由於淪陷區民衆的艱苦奮鬥，由於華北華中以至華東南各地抗戰游擊區抗×根據地之紛紛建立與發展，特別是由於汪精衛實國漢奸的言論行動之遭遇全國以至國際的痛擊，我們深信日×此種新的戰略，必將遭遇更狠狽的失敗。不過，我們從目前戰局觀察，就不能不提高大家對於日×漢奸在逆的警惕性，我們要預先打破日×所希望的「不戰不和」「亦戰亦和」；我們要澈底粉碎日×「以戰養戰』的陰謀。要實現這一希望，主要就要遵照蔣委員長的訓示，我們在政治上要加强團結，我們在經濟上要對鎖×人，我們在外交上要增進對英美法蘇的友善關係，我們在軍事上要力爭主動，力爭持久，堅持全面的抗戰，我們要加緊動員人力物力財辦去支持及發展×人後方的戰門，而特別重要的還要集中力量去粉碎日×鷹犬的漢奸在逆等敗類之欺民賣國的言論行動。</p>
<h3>一個新的敎育方法　進小組訓練的效率　知用中學論文比賽隊際冠軍</h3>
<p>— 鷹隊</p>
<p>社會越進步，則人們的工作越趨集體，也祇有集體工作　能產生鉅大的力量·團體是鉅大力量的集中，一個國體當中小組的組織可說是最簡的組織。小胡好隊人體當中的細胞，又好像一條强有力的鐵練當中的鐵　·我們能够利用細胞分裂的生長與小鐵環扣成長鐵練的原理去創造，推動一切工作的進進殿，這樣所得到的效果將必然的會超過沒有組織同樣人數的力量的總和的！小是組一個良好的組織這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>我們了解小組的意義，明瞭到小組的訓練是正確的，前進的敎育方針：是正確的前進的學習計劃，那麽我們應當如何的努力爲這計劃而鬥爭？怎樣去促進小組訓練的效率？</p>
<p>（一）實施民主精神：一個團體如果是要求進步，那麽必定要確立民主的精神，過去幾星期的小組訓練，因爲事前宣傳動員的基礎做得不好的緣故·雖然小組已　由訓育部强迫地叫我們亂凑亂扯的形式的組織起來，可是我們並不感覺得一組中各人是聯擊起來的，而且每種活動都是由上到下的强迫的督促的叫我們去做，不能使我們活躍的，積極的發揮各人的能力。我們爲增進工作的效能，一方面要確立小組的民主精神，使到每一位同學都能够自覺的積　的發揮每人的創造能力，負責精神以及對工作的活　。又一方面要採取民主集中制，不至於走到極端的自由放任主義，這樣的由下推動到上的活動，一定比較用各種方法來督促强制進步得多的！</p>
<p>（二）充實活動的內容：活動的內容必須切實配合目前抗戰的新形勢。救國建國都須要有健全的中堅組織。尤其是國未來主人翁更要有活躍氣象的組織的訓練。學校應當以培養抗戰幹部爲目的，使每一位同學　為抗戰而學習，組與組間的競賽成為自動的活潑的緊張的工作。每次活動完畢之後，都要有自我敎育的檢討，互相學習優點，互相幫助克服弱點。千萬不可造　成錦標主義的傾向，同時我們要能夠與功課並重。兩方面的工作都要積極的努力，不可機械的分開彼此的輕重而有所抑聞，工作內充實了！我們認定這方針去奮鬥，訓練的效率，將有長足的進步吧！</p>
<p>（三）提高小組的紀律性：個人自由主義的傾向，在小組中是絕對不可能的，所以必須要有鐵的紀律來維擊整固小組組織的機購，紀律是圓體的第二生命，是執行路綫的保證，沒有紀律就不能推動工作的開展，在小組的組織的訓中，必定要少數服從多數，個人服從團體，下級服從上級，這是民主集中制的精神的表現，每一位同學都是不能破壞的，但同時亦不是片面的命令主義，必定要建立在同學的自覺性上面，過去本校的小組訓練是太傾向命令主義了，此後希望採取民主集中制，每一種活動都要求得同學的自動自覺。</p>
<p>（四）建立模範小組；由許多競賽中得出一個績優良的小組，使之成爲全校的模範小組。每次活動都由模範小組肩負起積極的任務。模範小組是前進的，其他一切小組都要迎頭趕上，這樣一切工作都能有標準的，及實於戰鬥性的迅速的開展·模範小組在目前本校形勢下是極　急速的錯立的。急束的健立的。</p>
<p>以上算是我對於本校小組訓練效率的促進的小小意見，希望　明的先生們更應爲這正確的敎育方針積極地教導我們。並且爭取這正確的敎育方針的勝利，為培養抗戰幹部而盡一點神聖的責任。</p>

<h3>筆部隊在成都</h3>
<p>— 海帆</p>
<p>【民革社成都通訊】中國文藝界抗×協會中文壇健將新成立的生力軍——筆部隊，已於十九日由渝關抵成都，記者於廿一日午後九時三十分投刺往訪，叩以該隊此次遠征的預定路綫與工作的計劃等等問題，承宋之的副領隊詳吿如下：</p>
<p>筆部隊屬於中國文藝界抗×協會、係民衆團體。費比較缺乏，此次赴前綫工作，承軍委會黨政委員會資助經費，由渝至蓉本打算乘搭運輸車卡，結果因車輛缺乏乃改乘公路局車，刻聯票已購好，準備最近卽由成都赴西安，經費雖很困難，但不至發生很大的問題。</p>
<p>至於筆隊組織，除正領隊由王禮錫担任外，副領隊由宋担任，隊員有萬一虹，袁勃，方殷，羅烽，白朗，李輝英，張周，錢新之，陳曉南，楊騷，葉以羣，楊朔等共計十四人，就中王禮銀君學術上的修養是多方的發展，對于文學社會科學均有深刻的研究，楊騷之詩及劇本，羅烽之小說，錢新之的論文，皆爲喜好文學人士所　知，其他或長於編劇。或喜寫批評女學，或喜作詩及小說，皆有其獨到之處，勿勞記者　述，記者復詢以此次筆隊遠征經由的路綫，據宋氏答：遠征經由的路綫，計劃是打從川陝公路直赴四安，循騷海路以渡黃河，由第一戰區到第二戰區，深入晉東南各部隊中去，並到五台附近，晉冀察邊區參親宋助文領導之成讀，再轉河北看看廣鍾麟的施政概况及成果，然後經過山東，取道第五戰區襄樊宜昌返渝。</p>
<p>至於工作的計劃，大約分下列三項：</p>
<p>（一）携帶固有的刊物及册子，分散到前綫各部隊中或民衆中，更用通俗而具體的普遍宣傳，使士兵民衆深刻了解本身的任務，及抗戰的形勢，現時來各戰區工作的作家很多，我們很樂意與他們聯繫起來互相帮助。</p>
<p>（二）在前線和×人後方用集體採訪和創作的方式，將所得材料搜集起來提供後方。一方面更可以乘此收集許多抗戰史料以作將來創作的題材。</p>
<p>（三）將我各戰區英勇抗戰的史料和消息，扼要的分別編譯到國外發表，幷與外國作家互相聯絡，以宣揚我民埃抗戰的精神，至於編發到國外的題材，擬定由文協會駐香港辦事處收轉國外，遠扯歸來以後，打算將各方搜集材料出版專刊，以餉讀者，談話至此，各隊員皆已歸隊，拜訪者及送行者，相繼引去，記者乃亦辭別。</p>
<p>記者獨自走着，想到文藝界抗×協會的筆部隊，他們能掃除咬文嚼字舊習慣。以堅苦卓絕吃苦耐勞的精神，實地走向戰場，這種精神和魄力，眞令我們興奮和欽敬，我們希望筆部隊這支生力軍，站在本身崗位上努力去作啓蒙運動，希望他們在文化戰綫上去粉碎×人及僞組織的文化侵略陰謀，以筆桿的力量配含軍事力量去打擊×人，他們已經英勇的向戰場出發了，我們以高度的熱情敬祝他們成功。</p>
<h3>汕頭市的淪陷　日×掠奪汕頭目擊記</h3>
<p>— 本報特稿（二）　林高</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>將近九點鐘的時候，靠近碼頭的人們都向街心跑進，跟着有二架×機停下水面，我以爲這决不會是事實，跑向海岸望望，×機已是仍然飛到上空去。</p>
<p>夾着箱囊的人羣匆急地進入太古洋行，我站在它的門口望看爲的是什麽，</p>
<p>一個親戚硬把我拉進門內，他嚴重，急促，慌張地說：「飛機呼呼地低飛是什麽時候，還在街上亂跑！」</p>
<p>太古洋行內滿擠着人和行李，慌亂，汗酸，喘氣。</p>
<p>「媽嶼山上縣起日本旗了！」</p>
<p>「十種的兵艦駛進媽嶼口了！」息。</p>
<p>人羣擠出大門，跑過碼頭，登上「穎州輪」，對岸角石山沉痛地伏着，峯巒在它的兩旁聯着排成一列，這行列的東邊末端處，四個黑色的小點，像是烏糞，這些黑點，慢慢地移動，漲大！憤怒，恐怖也跟着增漲。</p>
<p>十點多鍾，獰惡的軍艦，飄着血滴濺散的標幟，從颕州輪面前駛過。</p>
<p>「隆降隆——隆隆隆」砲聲響了，殘酷的轟炸也開始了，泥土，烟沙，成堆的噴起，胸膛　着每一個爆裂聲發痛。</p>
<p>海面上×人灰黑色的汽艇。裝甲的，無蓬的，像老鼠一樣，四面竄　，尋覓食物，停泊在近山那邊以避×機掃射和轟炸的大木船，小汽艇，海關巡邏艇，都給它帶去，也給掛上那刺目的血滴濺散一樣的標幟？但是，却絕對地不敢駛近岸邊。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>一條灰色的小艇，前面包着　　的鐵皮，兩邊噴出白色的水浪，凶恨地駛到水上警察局的碼頭。</p>
<p>輪上的心絃都顯得繁漲，劇烈的戰鬥許就要開始。</p>
<p>可是，艇里爬出的兩匹×軍，穿着深綠巴衣服，站　起來，帶着一面那刺目的旗幟，望了幾下，爬上碼頭，預備要把旗揷上，可是，突然地又縮着頸子，手忙脚亂地逃下艇去，突然的動作，使小艇大大地搖擺，趨勢就逃駛向到海面。</p>
<p>「皇軍」就是和老鼠一樣的胆小。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>撲，撲，撲！</p>
<p>潮海關碼頭東角鋼骨水泥的砲壘中發出炮聲和烟火，殺人的子彈也　急雨一樣地襲擊着它，後面海關查貨場　牆壁，開了好多洞孔。</p>
<p>一個革綠色的戰士，握奮槍桿，左手垂着，從牆邊溜過，人炮彈舉着繼壁，泥塊和灰煙　射下來，他轉入堆棧的後面。　（未完）</p>

<h3>今日的日本</h3>
<p>— 世長</p>
<p>日本的侵華戰事，轉瞬卽將兩年，中國精誠團結，共禦外侮，這是日間意料所不及的。最近，日軍佔領了汕頭，在裏面上，這似乎又是日本的所謂「勝利」，但是，且待我們一看今日的日本：</p>
<p>此次戰事發生後不久，日本卽已感覺痛苦；因爲，經多年儲藏的軍火，都要化作灰燼了，而且，其中的大部分是準備對付勁敵——蘇聯——的，貸幣和原料的缺乏，本是戰時國家經濟緊縮的應有現象，毫不足異，但是，目前的日本，各業不振，人民苦悶，到處都表示着危險的象徽，現在，且就食品，材料，商業，財政各項，略加討論。</p>
<p>食品——政府對于牛奶，牛油，鷄蛋，和其他主要的食品，都已實施統制，食品成本，在一年之內，平均的增加了百分之十三，而自一九三七年七月七日以來，已經增加百分之廿三了。</p>
<p>材料——鐵質的食具和剃　的舊刀片，都經徵集溶化，以製造軍火，在另售市場中，絲織和羊毛的衣服，已經絕跡，日政府準備以人迭綫緋質替代絲織品，但沒有成功。</p>
<p>商業——政府訓令各銀行滅低小額放款的利息，統制物價，而未統制薪給；所以，千千萬萬的大小商人都因此而受損，而破產。</p>
<p>財政——日本財政基礎的不穩，是盡人皆知的，最近，日圓暴跌，並不是偶然的，近來，日藏相對於一九三八年的冶金業，表示「失望」，也未始沒有理由、日本於本年四月，沒有一分的餘錢向美國購買戰事材料。</p>
<p>從上述的各項情形中，我們可以顯然的發現兩點：第一，日本的存金，已將用盡；第二，通貨膨脹的情形，如果不是眞正的通貨脹，已遂漸在日本國內展開，日×戰時問題是朴端嚴重的。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>×覬覦福州溫州</h3>
<p>日×強佔汕頭以後，茲已進逼潮州，一面又在舟山群島登陸強佔定海。而據咋晚消息，則日×又有進逼福州溫州企圖。於是沿海形勢，又　緊張。</p>
<p>日×爲世界三大海軍國之一，挾有強大的現代海軍。我國沒有海軍，所以在抗戰開始，卽已準備以空間換取時間，消耗×軍戰鬥力，爭取最後勝利。沿海一帶，早已完成非常準備。日×之進奪我沿海，原非章外。而適在此日×侵華戰事遭遇空前困難之際，始作大規模的進擾，徒足以暴露其醜態而已！</p>
<p>×擾沿海，為配合政治進攻，尤其是配合經濟進攻，其理由已見今日社評，其意義首在威脅英國，次之始爲我國內地生產與×後戰鬥部隊。至於我們的對策，則在加強×後游擊戰鬬，及打一切漢奸傀儡組織，同時加緊促進遠東反侵略運動，尤其是推進援華制日運動。</p>
<p>日×進擾沿海，祇是日暮途窮的掙扎，不僅不能威脅我們，並能更增我們堅持抗戰必勝的信念，浙閩粵省山地，將爲日×最後的墳墓！</p>
<h3>東洋戲，搜黃金</h3>
<p>日×侵華，已遭軍大困難，因此窮兇極惡，毒焰高漲，一面加緊破壞及劫奪英國在華一切權益，（如最近封鎖天津和界強佔汕頭進逼騙州溫州等），一面却又裝腔做勢的進攻蘇聯外蒙，誇大宜傳「捷報」；我們在這裏要請讀者注意，不要忽視一件大事，卽英日正在東京進行談判！日×這些戲法，做給誰看的？難道還不明白嗎？日×窮極　　的兇相，難道還不明白嗎？</p>
<p>今天還有一個東京消息，說日政府定期七日一日開始存金登記，各外籍僑民亦須一律登記存金，這裏可見日×國庫空虛急謀搜刦民間育金的眞相了！其實，日本人民的財產，早經種種方式化爲日軍侵華的兇器，這次搜金。主眼厥在外僑身上，『危邦不居』，找們見日×處境更將孤危，不知一般爲日×瘋狂誇張怎軍力」的，將以怎樣一副醜嘴臉見人？</p>
<h3>蒙偽邊境　續有空戰　擊落日機二十五架　日方又作神話宣傳</h3>

<h3>但澤兩魔王　納粹官場現形記</h3>
<p>雖然，許多大國，都有一個獨裁魔王；可是，小小的但澤自由市，却有着兩個：一個是參議院議長葛里斯；另一個是納粹支部的黨魁佛士特。</p>
<p>兩個人，都是道　的納粹嘍囉，但兩個人之間，却仇深似海，其實，兩個人，都與但澤風馬牛不相及，全是自外面闖進來的客卿。又高又大的葛里斯，是波蘭西部人；長個子鷹眼睛的佛士特，是在紐倫堡附近出世的。</p>
<p>葛里斯今年四十四歲了，比佛士特長十歲之多；可是，雖然，馬齒徒增，在納粹黨中，他仍是佛士特的下級。因此，在但澤，處處地方，老葛也得讓小佛一步。</p>
<p>幾年前，小佛已經在大嚷「元首萬歲」了，老　還是規規矩矩地在一家猶太店裏，當店員。他到但澤來的時候，身上只帶着一塊在大戰中獲得的獎章，自命是一個高明的飛行員。佛士特來的時候，是更狼狽了；套着破褲子，餓着肚皮，四面亂闖；結果做了一名衙吏。</p>
<p>現在呢？葛里斯有那取之不竭，用之不盡的支票；佛士特則擁書但澤四週的許多華麗房產。兩個人，都嗜錢如命，老葛是化得兇，小佛則是守財奴。</p>
<p>葛里斯在但澤，因爲　史繁多，乃出了名。佛士特則是因爲一次攻擊興登堡，丟了官，才露頭角的。</p>
<p>大約在猶太店裏，受夠了氣的原故，葛里斯成了排猶的專家。但澤前任議長羅斯博士，排猶不力，被希特勒攆走了，便換上了葛里斯。</p>
<p>佛士特則由於希特勒姐姐的推薦，於是，也到但澤來做小皇帝。</p>
<p>葛里斯是戈林的忠實信徒；他自己甚且認爲，有點像戈林元帥。於是，一切都學戈林了。穿制服，打獵，連到歡喜掛獎章的脾氣，都跟戈林一樣。傳說，他因爲自己的獎章，不夠多，把他父親在普法戰爭中，掙來的紅十字徽章，都掛將起來。他常常打扮得全副戎裝，在街上走，只歡喜聽人家時他「上尉」，不要聽：「議長先生」。</p>
<p>佛士特則完全相反，他是以摹仿希特勒爲原則。不過，老婆倒是討的。他的丈人是一個建築師，結果，全但澤的公共建築，都重新造過。</p>
<p>兩個人，在但澤都得不到好感。葛里斯比較好　一點，能演說一兩個鐘頭，煽動一番。大約他到底是波蘭人，還留一點子良心，所以對波蘭人，對國聯管理委員，都　好，這是佛士特大肆攻擊的事。有時候，葛里斯也會「深入民間」，去跟人民談談笑話：這在佛士特看來，太下流，决不可爲。</p>
<p>天無二日，這是不會錯的。這末小的但澤，怎能夠兩個魔王的居留；所以，吵鬧終年不斷　人們已司空見慣了。常常你會看見，佛士特怒氣冲天地，自參議院衝出來，帽子都忘記了；接着，葛里斯把他的帽子拋出來。同樣地，在大庭廣衆之中，你會看見葛里斯拒絕和佛士特握手。</p>
<p>吵完了之後，佛七特總是跑到希特勒那兒去吿狀；葛里斯則找戈林和戈培爾去訴苦。結果，大半都是佛士特占上風。</p>
<p>葛里斯已經給希特勒叫去，訓了兩次了，說他的態度太軟弱，若再如此，就要撤職了。這個，速戈林戈培爾都徒呼負負。而佛十特自然更飛揚跋扈了。</p>
<p>也許，在不久的將來，但澤也要變成一個獨裁魔王了。</p>

<p>那個一度替美人魚拉馬車，而出盡風頭的褚大鬍子；做官之外，還身通六藝：踢鍵子，太極拳……都是拿手好戲。此外，更還常常要粉墨登場，來齣現身色相。</p>
<p>一次，褚大鬍子又應什麽會的禮聘，登台表演了。演的角色，自然免不了又是鼻頭上塗貼白的。</p>
<p>「空城計」出台了，褚大鬍子扮看白臉的司馬懿，率領大小三軍衝了出來。</p>
<p>去諸葛亮的，是名票魏新綠女士，正唱得上勁的時候，褚大鬍子突然心血來潮，想想明明是空城，幹嗎要倒退四十里；於是嚷起了：</p>
<p>「大小兒郎聽將令，跟隨本帥衝進城！」</p>
<p>台上一陣子亂，那位女諸葛可昏倒了：只　得一句倒板：</p>
<p>「啊呀，不好了！想不到我諸葛的空城計，也有不靈的一天！」</p>

<h3>海上風雲</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，德輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上接着個消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來。不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息。幸虧冰山不久便滑過去了，但是不久，又有一艘英兵艦來攔截，開炮起來，打中船尾，但，僥倖霧降下來了。……</p>
<p>『對的，只是這種在霧裏面捉迷藏的玩意兒，把我要鬧神經成病啦。』比爾咕嚕着。</p>
<p>黃昏時候，船已經穿過霧，但是，每一隻眼睛都憂慮的張望着，只恐在灰色海天中中又竄出一隻英國的黑色大獵犬釆。</p>
<p>但是，并沒有再遇見這類的事，雖然，到了晚上，在他們航線以東很遠的，看得見有巡洋艦上的探海燈，一條條的白光，像手指般伸張着，向各處搜查。第二天又平安無事的過了。第三天早上，天上露出熹微的晨光時，傑克由無線電室裏探頭向外望一望，發覺他們的船正向着一個陌生，奇怪、粗陋的海岸進行。</p>
<p>到這時候，旅客們都活動起來駛近海岸的沿邊，漸漸顯出一點點的是茅房和木屋，正在用早餐之間，船駁進了一個港裏，鐵錨轟隆隆的擲下云，餐室裏的人，頓時一走而空人都鬨到申板上了。</p>
<p>『怎麽，看上去那所屋子跟我在白港的家簡直一個式樣，』一個女人嚷着。</p>
<p>十分鐘之後，證明她并沒看錯，這地方就楚美國的白港。船長因爲不敢駛往紐約，或者波士頓，所以就挑選了這個世界聞名的避暑盛地，這地方英國巡洋艦是不會怎樣注意到的，果然，他推算得不錯，「運金船」總算經過了一番風險，仍售安然抵達了一個桃源。船停妥了，一個鐘頭以後，旅客們幾乎全上了岸，他們都忙着去拍電報，往各處報吿平安消息。</p>
<p>無綫電廣播到千萬里之外，都知道這船已經平安抵岸了。幾天前，『運金船』失踪的消息，的確讓人們忙了一陣，報上登着許多猜測得到的危險，說她已經被俘了，進了英國海口了；或者，沉沒了，滿船所載都蕩盡無餘，却沒有人猜得着，「運金船』居然在風雲險惡的海面，溜囘來了。</p>
<p>第二天，傑克雷德和比爾南諾。魯蒙加羅三人住到一家旅館里，傑克收到了一封電報，是邱克斯先生發來的，上電寫着：欣悉汝已安担，至紐約後卽來余辦公室一談，有要事相商。</p>
<p>「又是些什麼事？」傑克驚奇的問比爾。</p>
<p>「我摸不着一點影兒，」比爾說，『不過在我腦子里有一個念頭，就是你的假期算完啦。』</p>
<p>「你還能說這是假期」，傑克笑普。</p>
<p>『不錯，若說是經驗，也許較妥恰一點。』比爾也笑起來。</p>
<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>津局僵持久矣，英臼談之又談，商之又商，停停頓頓，一無結果。昨天的消息，英政府將宜布與日本正式談判，這不知是什麼意思？</p>
<p>你現在該相信吧，軍事是德意日的統盤陰謀。日本在台上做，德意在、一旁吶喊。意報說：老帝國動搖。戈培爾說：英國無實力爲後盾也。好了，且讓綏靖政策去綏靖這些吶喊吧！</p>
<p>消息傳來，英國準備加緊英蘇談判，將允諾蘇聯的一切條件了。但願早日見諸事實，識時務者爲俊傑</p>
<p>本港在增加後備警察了，阿彌陀佛，善哉。但望早日額滿，練成，予賊徒一點顏色看看。警察萬歲！</p>
<p>到澳門去要兩塊　防疫手續費，到安南去，竟要一百元保證金了。自從廣州淪陷，進過入國，已成了必經之道，走過的人，叫苦連天，現在又要保證金，似乎太「那個」了。如果事情屬實，但望外交當局，籌一點妥當辦法。</p>
<p>翻開一張報，第一版登着「裸國風光」開影廣吿，陳霎裳主演云云。第二版登着「陳雲裳啟事」，否認曾主演「裸國風光」。二十世紀世界，廣吿世界，生意眼世界。</p>
<h3>雨花</h3>
<p>牙醫：奇怪，你說浸有鑲通金牙，怎麼會有金子拿出來了。</p>
<p>病人：你一定把我頸後硬領上的鈕子也挖出來了。</p>
<p>旅客看了房間，不滿意的說：這房間又黑，又悶氣。像監牢一樣。</p>
<p>茶房：先生，你是犯過罪的嗎？</p>
<p>教師點名：白朗！</p>
<p>聲音：到！</p>
<p>教師：白朗在那裏？……方才是那一個答應的？請站起來。</p>
<p>學生：是我聽錯了，以爲先生是點我的名字呢！</p>
<p>教師：你呌什麽名字？</p>

<h3>中藝第六次公演感言</h3>
<p>— 陽歐予倩</p>
<p>中藝本來是把每排演一次新的劇本算一次公演的，可是這樣計算相當麻煩，所以從這一囘起，把辦法改變一下，以後每上演一次，就算一次公演。——此次粵語組爲第一次公演，國語組爲第一八次公演。</p>
<p>照中藝的經濟情形和物質的設備看起來，不僅不能如林梅綺女士義演，連院租都個人祖任，作那樣的豪舉，就是每次公演都要經過許多的艱難籌劃，才能勉强實現。</p>
<p>這一次總算借了當當又演成了，大家都不勝快慰，上演成績好與不好，儘可不問，只要在可能的範圍當中，把應作的工作作了也就是了，一次一次公演，一步一步把工作推進，這是中藝在現階段所取的態度。</p>
<p>我們听支持的是抗戰與建國，所謂戲劇工作，就是每一個戲劇家，把精神體力献給抗戰建國的表現，我們儘可用種種的方式——直接的，間接的，直線的，曲線的，怒吼的，婉動的，單刀直入式的，旁敲側擊式的，鼓勵的，諷刺的，整個的，片段的——來宣傳抗戰，同時也要用研究的，積蓄的，開　的，建設的態度與精神在工作當中逐漸建立起中國的新興戲劇。</p>
<p>抗戰是長期的，建國也要相當的時期，所以戲劇工作是長期的，新興戲劇的建立也不是短時間的事。我們要把全副精神使工作推進到預定的目標，我們要把全部心血灌溉這新興戲劇的蓓蕾，使之成長，使之發揚光大。</p>
<p>我們的工作是長期的，所以要作長期的準備。要認定一個理想的目標，要跟着一定的步驟，要以不斷的努力　澈主張。在工作的進行當中，决不能一時這樣想，一時那樣想。</p>
<p>我們不見得齣齣戲都受數迎，不見得每次唱的調子一樣高，在策略十不見得沒有偶然的錯誤與失敗，只要對於原則和主張認識淸楚，把握得穩固，一時的得失昇沉，儘管不放在心上。最要緊的是：有錯誤不掩飾，也不必轉灣抹角角去求人諒解，遇着失敗也無須遮蓋，祇要隨時留意，隨時改進，那便越多經幾次得失昇沉的磨練，越能使事業堅固地進展。</p>
<p>中藝在香港成立，工作自然要從香港作起，這裏有僑胞百餘萬，如果不視同化外，就在這襄演幾個比較有意義的戲給他們看看，或許也不會被認爲沒有意義。有許多人都是從內地來的，也曾受過戰爭與轟炸的威脅。香港目下雖然沒有被轟炸，但在這裏作戲劇工作的種種困難，也未嘗不能把一個人脆弱的心房壓碎。</p>
<p>留在香港的劇團不妨多對港九的觀衆說說法，多給他們一點安慰與刺激，認爲有補充內容的必要，也不妨利用這裏的空間時間等等好好地補充一下。有到內地的必要便毫不疑遲到內地去，也止和在內地的劇團有離開內地的必要時便離開內地一樣。離開內地自有其任務，囘到內地去，也幷不是要到轟炸中去造資格。</p>
<p>目下在內地工作的戲劇宣傳隊，祇就軍委會政治部直屬的就有四　幾隊分配在各戰區工作，他們的組織當然完全和職業劇圍不同。他們所得到的種種經騐，有許多可以供我們的參考與學習，可是他們也有許多地方要向有經騐有訓練的職業劇團請益的。譬如導演就很缺乏，如果有會表演，又會導演的人，各處都很需要。還有就是劇本，在內地用演劇作宣傳，大致都是流動的演出，可以無須像香港邇樣要多量的新劇本，可是現在的情形也有些變化，因爲要使演劇隊的隊員和戰區當地的民衆打成一片，親密地聯絡起見，每一個演劇隊都要比較長的時間留在戰區，如果每天表演同樣的劇本，豈不乏味？所以也希望劇本的產量增加。這些都不妨分工合作，在後方的作家們大可努力一下。一個作家如果前方急切需要他去補充，他自然應當卽刻背着鎗走向戰　，不然便可留他在後方讓他努力寫作。正好比熟練工人，要拿鎗就拿槍，不抓槍的時候就在後方增加生產。香港的戲劇工作者如果能够大家聯合起來，加强組織和訓練，常和內地的戲劇工作者建立通信關係，互相討論，互相帮助，必定有可觀的成績。不過這種事也要有專人主持，也還要有相當的經費。香港的戲劇工作者太窮了是眞的，不過也不能够等到確實有了錢再作，只能作着再看，如果有人發起，有人組織，中藝必定跟　。</p>
<p>至於義演，本來不是戲劇工作者本身的任務，爲了救濟和籌餉，自然也是應當作的，中藝此次公演之前，有兩次義演，公演之後，緊接着又是義演，能够間接帮助難民和傷兵，豈不也很好？不過只是很平淡的事罷了。當目下這個時候，能够多爲社會服務，總是好的。只是戲劇工作者對於本身任務的達到，往往煞費苦心而所得的結果幷不能如預期的美滿，這是値得加培努力的。</p>
<p>中藝成立未久，工作雖作得幷不算十分少，內容還不能說十分健全，這一次公演，不過進程當中的一小小分站我們只向耕耘，不計收穫。但是每一次演出成績的互相比較，和逐一地嚴密檢討也是必要的，還望看戲的女士先生隨時不各指敎？</p>

<h3>夏夜曲</h3>
<p>— 殊倫</p>
<p>在昏亂中，我撫過了夏夜之尾巴、躱在牆頭外的夜貓不是叫出迷離的調子嗎？</p>
<p>窻格過濾着深夜的顏色，夜在進展中。風，仲夏夜之煽動者呵！吹開了床上失眠者的緊皺着眼睛。</p>
<p>黑色的夜掩護着虱子的爬行，這，使得未眠者的眼睛是多麽空處而無奈呢！</p>
<p>深沉的夜色，說是能給人以巨量的沉思和記億嗎？我考問着自已，遠年的事都會在這個時分齋向着我的腦海歸來？</p>
<p>夜貓　管是撒野地叫著，虱子也儘管住滿了我的身子。然而，早年的記憶果能搜索着它的影子而來嗎？</p>
<p>我記得我是一個少年的歌者吧？當年。我不是爲唱着動人的曲子而排遣過我底時光麽？</p>
<p>然而，這一些也不値得人們去留戀的，永遠使人刻記着的，還是那充賽着街頭的解放的歌聲。</p>
<p>可不是麽？勝利的一夜，永遠貫滿著南國熱情的我們，不是爲那風傳着的台兒莊底捷報而捲進熱閙的街心去麽？</p>
<p>那時，激情的靑年呵？拍著肩，踏着脚板，引吭地高歡，路人們都張開了歡笑的鐵臉，轉向我們。</p>
<p>而今，黑夜雖是蒙蔽了，我回憶底路子，然而，目前的晨曦才是最美麗的彩色呵！</p>
<h3>海河的濁浪</h3>
<p>— 湘候</p>
<p>這是在天津的英國人A，寫給上海的英國人B的一封信。B是我的朋友，承他允許，我得以將信中國於天津方面的一段，譯出發表。但他不肯將眞姓名宦佈，因此這裏只稱他們爲A，B。</p>
<p>在上海，空氣還比較新鮮，雖然我們已感覺到復窒息了：可是在天津，這古老的都市，祇有海河的濁浪，還能自由地翻騰。外國人的我，在這裏也不容易獲到像在中國其他地方的一般的優待。果然，這裏也有我們的租界，但情形比上海更壞十倍，租界裏也是海河樣的，氾濫着濁流。</p>
<p>初到這裏，甚於囚犯之到審判廳，盤詰極嚴，而且見過了『小鬼』，還得見『神明』——所謂『小鬼』「神明」，是天津流行的隱語。『神明』指日本人，『小鬼』則不言可喻了。——前幾天，似乎我的行動，無時不在被監視中，後來，我特地往訪從前在哈爾濱認識的一位中國友人，他有一個不十分陌生的名字：『陶言心』（譯音），從前他曾一度被少年將軍張學良拘禁過的，現在却在這裏做敎育上的行政長官。數年不見，這位中年政客已蓄起納粹式的鬚子；我知道他過去的歲都費在「善　」工作上，現在他似乎已部份地成功；可是他的地位無時不在如睡夢中幌勵着。在北方的『小鬼』——恐怕不單在北方如此，一方面要受多疑的『神明』的猜忌，另一方面要顧慮到在這土地裏生長着的兒女們的注意。</p>
<p>天津華人的最大的危險，是思想問題。『思想犯』在牢獄中幾乎無法收容。因爲所謂思想犯者，含義至廣，有一位中國會師，爲着在一個圓圈之下畫了一枝梅花，爲警察拘去。據畫帥說：這圓圈是徵象月亮，中國人書梅花大概都和月亮畫在一起，可是日本人說這圓圈象徵是太陽，而梅花乃是蔣政府所定的國花！</p>
<p>在這裏，日人於中國之充當警察者，係以拘捕他們的同胞之多寡，作爲陞遷的標準。因此天津的警察一天到晚以捕人唯一的職務，往往二個警察相遇時，互詢：『今兒淘着多少金沙？』金沙竟成爲犯人的代名詞！可是，天津的警察，往往在黑夜執行職務時，自己也變了他人的「金沙」！</p>
<p>這邊，燃燒的事件特別多，面且起火的處所，大槪都屬某方的產業，至於起火的原因，則連當事人也諱英如深！</p>
<p>經濟的掠奪，在這裏可說是巨細無遺，你於此可以看出他們的搜刮手段了。</p>
<h3>擈向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>她役彿又聽見那哀懇無力的話語！</p>
<p>「靑芷，你就這樣子離開家了麼？」</p>
<p>『爲什麽不呢？我以爲凡是年靑人都沒有再留在這裏的必要，我得工作，否則我會悶死的。』</p>
<p>我明白你的意思，可是我不信你一個弱女子能做多少事，——當然，我不是看不起你，不過我以爲你的家更需要你，還有我，我也更需要你。』</p>
<p>「哼，整個民族要是不存在，家還有行麼用？你我的關係有什麽用？不要再來勸阻我了。」</p>
<p>「當然我會記得你，自然我也希望勝利的一天，我看見你健康地囘來，我知道我沒有用，可是我對你的心是好的。……」</p>
<p>於是她的腦子裏又閃映出那麽一張淸秀的臉容，在那深摯的眼睛的下面，掛下兩行淚珠；一個瘦長的背影，幌動若沉沒在嘈雜的人羣裏，沉沒在浩茫無限的大海裏……</p>
<p>「如今我眞的是一個人了，沒有什麼牽掛，沒有什麼情感的累贅，我該供献我的生命，爲了整個民族的復生。」</p>
<p>黑夜不知道從是天頂垂下來或是從四周扯上去，它包攏了一切。陰雲障蔽着，沒有月亮也沒有星，船在黑暗中繼續地闖着，增重了第一次海行的人的恐懼。</p>
<p>她好像睡了一覺又轉轉來，急急地捻開燈。纔知道夢境是不眞實的。狹小的木床使她的腰腿疼痛，更響亮的海浪的聲音。彷彿天在落着暴風雨，她自自然然地想起一些可怕的情景；用手推着睡在下面的靜聞；可是她一　也沒有醒，仍自香甜地睡着。她就獨自穿起衣服，把大衣也穿上，跑到甲板上去。</p>
<p>不辨一物的黑暗擠在四周，桅頂上模糊的燈光，若有若無地幌着，沒有碧綠的海水，沒有雪白的浪花，也沒有風雨，只是黑暗黑暗，突然，遠遠地　過來幾支强烈的燈光，從不同的方向，都向著這隻船射探。頓時，海水是亮晶的，船面上的一切都被照得很淸楚，一個船員從艙裏鑽出來向她說：</p>
<p>「小姐，請你不要站到外邊，這是鬼子兵船的探照燈，怕萬一惹出什麼麻煩來」。</p>
<p>「好，我就下去。」</p>
<p>她一面說着，一面又走囘去，失去了恐懼心，却生出無比的憤恨。她知道如果中國有像樣的海軍，日本人先就不能踏上中國的土地。可是如今在土地上，在空中，我們己經盡了我們的力量；在海上，只得任着敵人橫行。</p>
<p>四天的海行，把她們送到一個新的陌生的地方。給進了港口，就在海中停下來，旣不攏岸，也沒有接客的小船，這使她們兩個生疏的旅客。懷若更大的憂懼、間若別人，纔知道要經過一番檢疫的手續，繼能到岸上去。</p>
<p>「那可怎麽辦，他們說好來接的」。　（未完）</p>

<h3>Occupation and Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yumei</p>
<p>— Dedicated to shop clerks and apprentices —</p>
<p>Due to the different family circumstances of each person, some lucky individuals, upon reaching your age, progress from elementary school to middle school, or from middle school to university, leading their precious school lives. However, you, burdened by the inability of your families to afford these expensive school fees, serve as junior clerks or apprentices in shops. I believe you possess a strong desire for knowledge, and I also understand that your level of knowledge likely does not exceed that of higher elementary education. Therefore, I know that among you, there must be many who, unable to satisfy their thirst for knowledge, feel aversion towards their occupations, or even become passive due to an excessively strong desire for knowledge. Here, the writer sincerely hopes that shop clerks and apprentices do not become passive or resent their occupations, thus wasting your precious futures, simply because your circumstances do not allow you to pursue higher knowledge.</p>
<p>Occupation and knowledge are inherently inseparable. However, most merchants, with their stubborn minds, believe that a person should seek knowledge in their youth, but once they step through the door of a shop, they should no longer talk about knowledge, only needing to use their brains in business. This gives rise to the current phenomenon where those employed in shops are not allowed to seek knowledge. Because of this, countless promising young people are ruined. This is entirely because they do not understand the importance of knowledge to occupation. It is said that a person without high intelligence will naturally not obtain a better occupation. Similarly, if one does not even have an elementary school education, it is impossible to employ them as a shop clerk. Furthermore, national changes and social dynamics can all affect the development of commerce, all of which require judgment based on observation. And the development of observational skills largely depends on your knowledge. In addition, everyone's thoughts and actions can also receive correct guidance through knowledge. Therefore, knowledge and occupation are inseparable.</p>
<p>Currently, especially in old-fashioned shops, leisure time is out of the question. It is indeed difficult to find three to five hours to study the knowledge you need in your spare time. However, I hope that with your personal perseverance and determination to seek knowledge, and with a sincere attitude, you will try your best to persuade your managers. If you cannot obtain sufficient time, you should still try to set aside one or two hours before your scheduled wake-up time in the morning. I think this is probably possible, as long as you are determined and willing to work hard continuously, there will definitely be a day of hope in the future. Look at Mr. Wang Yunwu; his current position in the cultural world was also obtained through continuous self-study. Therefore, you must not succumb to your circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, the writer sincerely recommends a publication that suits your practical needs – the Self-Study Weekly. Its contents include national and English common knowledge, bookkeeping, and more, making it a good educational reading material for leisure time. Of course, publications like "The National Resistance War" and "Reading Monthly" are also excellent new reading materials for you.</p>
<p>Modern Youth, inscription by Cai Yuanpei (Second Issue)</p>
<h3>Youth Movement and National Liberation</h3>
<p>— Ma Li</p>
<p>It is no accident that China's youth movements have all emerged in the posture of fighting for national liberation. This precisely illustrates that the youth problem in China is merely a part of the national problem, and striving for national liberation is the prerequisite for resolving the suffering of the youth.</p>
<p>Over the years, China has suffered direct oppression and exploitation from invaders, even to the point of seizure, and the constraints imposed through the remaining feudal forces have deprived Chinese youth of not only proper guarantees but also the freedom and rights they deserve in terms of thought, activity, love, occupation, and even fundamental life.</p>
<p>Our Chinese youth have suffered, and the root cause of this suffering lies in the gradual advance of the invaders. Because of their suffering, they feel indignation. Because of their indignation, they rise up and resist. The purpose of their resistance is to establish a free and independent democratic republic in order to eliminate suffering and find a way out. The target of their resistance is undoubtedly the invaders and the feudal forces they utilize.</p>
<p>Therefore, China's youth movement is inevitably connected and intertwined with the anti-aggression and anti-feudal national liberation movement.</p>
<p>From the "May Fourth Movement" of 1919, the "May Thirtieth Movement" of 1925, to the "December Ninth Movement" and "December Sixteenth Movement" of 1935, whether their development led to the New Culture Movement, the National Revolution, or the united resistance against Japan, their origins lay in resisting the oppression of the invading countries, and their essence was the same, permeated with the meaning of the national struggle.</p>
<p>In China, which is in a state of being an oppressed and invaded semi-colony, not only the youth feel incomparable suffering, but the masses of the entire nation are also experiencing incomparable pain. This is a very obvious fact. However, because the youth are keenly aware, emotionally passionate, strong-willed, clearly aware, and possess robust minds and bodies and a superior position, they always stand at the forefront of the national liberation struggle, acting as vanguard warriors who are prescient, leading, and fighting.</p>
<p>There are indeed many factors in the outbreak of our country's all-out war of resistance against Japan, but we should recognize the role played by the accumulation of youth movements over the years, especially the role played by the heroic struggles of the December Movement against aggression, traitors, division, and puppets. This role is being nurtured and developed in today's war of resistance against Japan. Many young people have already rushed to the front lines to participate in the war, and many young people are engaged in practical work such as propaganda, organization, fundraising, and comforting troops in various places.</p>
<p>Looking back at the youth here, some are living a life of luxury and indulgence, some are studying dead books in an academic style for the sake of a diploma, and some are frustrated because they cannot go to the inland or front lines to do something earth-shattering. There are very few who can truly recognize the reality and bury themselves in hard work. They have to do this and that, day and night, exhausted. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Intensify self-education, young friends! Stand up and carry forward the glorious history created by your peers: do not seek temporary stimulation and excitement, but treat every foothold as a front line, and arduously and practically undertake your own tasks in the current environment, contributing every ounce of strength and light to the brilliant future of the nation!</p>
<p>After the complete victory of our national liberation struggle, the youth problem will be solved one by one, and the youth of all of China will then be able to live a rational and ideal life!</p>
<h3>World Science News: Children's Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>A telephone bureau has been established in the English Scow "Central Park for Culture and Recreation," and all work is undertaken by children. There are a total of 80 lines, connecting all the houses and institutions in the children's farm in the park. There are also 25 telephone receivers installed in various parts of the farm, each representing the name of a famous city in a foreign country. The intention is to encourage children to use the telephone to make international calls, and when communicating with a certain country, they use the language of that country. Those in charge of the telephone bureau are 50 skilled members of the Archimedes Society, which is dedicated to young inventors. (Soviet Yearbook, Dan)</p>
<h3>Wireless Electric Light</h3>
<p>Frenchman Costel has invented a way to light lamps with radio waves and has recently obtained a patent. This new type of light bulb is spherical and has no filament. The interior is a vacuum coated with phosphorescent or other luminescent powdered chemicals. When excited by high-frequency radio waves, it emits bright light. When in use, it is hung on a line (metal wire), which is used as the antenna of a small radio transmitter. From this, we predict that in the future, this type of light bulb may be used to illuminate streets and homes. When used to illuminate streets, the antenna used is a single wire, and when used to illuminate rooms, the antenna can be parallel or fan-shaped wires. (New York Times, Dan)</p>
<h3>Several Model Children</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>China is roaring, and China's children are also roaring.</p>
<p>The following are stories of several model children during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>1.  Yang Huimin, the girl scout who presented the flag to the four hundred isolated troops. Yang Huimin is a brave girl scout. In late October of the previous year, when our army retreated from the Songhu area, four hundred soldiers remained stationed in the Sihang Warehouse on the Suzhou River, vowing to fight to the last drop of blood and demand the price they deserved from the invaders. Yang Huimin braved the dangers and sent a national flag into the warehouse, expressing her respect to the four hundred isolated troops who were loyal and brave in defending the country. In the last position in Zhabei, amidst smoke and surrounded by enemy flags, the bright and dazzling national flag of the Republic of China flew on top of our Sihang Warehouse, showing that our army was still holding Zhabei and promoting our great Chinese spirit!</p>

<p>"There can be no 'peace' with the enemy!"</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Current War Situation</h3>
<p>The main characteristics of the current war situation are:</p>
<p>On our side, it is to intensify guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and accelerate preparations for the future implementation of the "strategic counter-offensive" while maintaining a stalemate with the Japanese, in order to realize the elimination and expulsion of the Japanese from China as soon as possible and plant our flag of blue sky and white sun at the head of the Yalu River!</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, their current operations are mainly to coordinate with political and economic offensives to create a situation of "neither war nor peace" in order to intensify the consolidation of their rule over the occupied areas, utilize the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of our occupied areas, and painstakingly arrange for the "complete conquest of China and then dominating East Asia." Therefore, their current military requirement is to realize "using war to sustain war."</p>
<p>Since the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the early stage of the War of Resistance came to an end. The Japanese strategy turned towards the above direction, and the facts of the past few months since the capture of Nanchang have further proved that the Japanese military's intention is to "use war to sustain war." This is because the Japanese military has encountered significant difficulties and setbacks in its military invasion of China, and its war strength has been greatly weakened and depleted, so it has had to begin to take defensive steps!</p>
<p>However, the Japanese army is still an army with the latest modern equipment and configurations. It has great mobility and still holds several larger cities, controlling several major railway transportation lines. Therefore, although it has to adopt a defensive and replenishing strategy, it is still possible to select places it considers weak and places where it believes our army's mobile operations and reinforcements are poor, and launch fierce attacks, "effectively occupying" them, and then rest and look for a second target. The attack on Nanchang was for this purpose, as was the encirclement of Mount Dahong, the seven attacks on Mount Zhongtiao, and the recent landings in Shantou, Dinghai, and other places.</p>
<p>Whether it is an attack on Shanxi to threaten Shaanxi, or harassing our coastal areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, the current Japanese offensive can be said to have the same intention, that is, to try to prevent our army on the front lines from launching a counter-offensive in the Japanese-occupied areas, to try to suppress the guerrillas destroying the Japanese army's rear in North China, Central China, and Southeast China, to try to strengthen the rule of the Japanese puppet regime in the occupied areas, to try to strengthen its cultural anesthesia and economic plunder of the occupied areas, and to try to destroy and plunder the power of the European and American powers in China and plunder the foreign trade interests of the coastal provinces of Southeast China. In short, it is to try to realize its new sinister plan of "using war to sustain war" by "requisitioning grain on the spot and seeking self-sufficiency" in its invasion of China.</p>
<p>The Japanese attempt to "use war to sustain war" and create a situation of "neither war nor peace" also has a more vicious conspiracy, which is to use the "victory" of the leaping war to stimulate its domestic people and numb the emotions of our country's resistance to Japan, that is, to use slogans such as "peace" and "anti-communism" to entice our wavering elements and stubborn elements to divide our national unity, destroy the "proactive, long-term, and comprehensive war of resistance" led by Chairman Chiang, and use deceptive means to force the United States to abandon its policy of aiding China and compromise and cooperate with Japan to force us to submit, and then realize its "preliminary step in dominating the world" and establish a "new order in East Asia"!</p>
<p>Due to our national unity, political progress, and improved international reputation, due to the strengthening of our front-line combat effectiveness, due to the hard struggle of the people in the occupied areas, due to the establishment and development of anti-Japanese base areas in the anti-Japanese guerrilla areas in North China, Central China, and even Southeast China, especially due to the nationwide and even international condemnation of Wang Jingwei's traitorous words and actions, we firmly believe that this new Japanese strategy will encounter a more embarrassing failure. However, from the observation of the current war situation, we must raise everyone's vigilance against the Japanese traitors, and we must preemptively break the "neither war nor peace" and "both war and peace" that the Japanese hope for; we must completely smash the Japanese conspiracy of "using war to sustain war." To realize this hope, the main thing is to follow Chairman Chiang's instructions: we must strengthen unity in politics, we must economically blockade the Japanese, we must enhance friendly relations with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in diplomacy, we must strive for initiative and perseverance in the military, persist in a comprehensive war of resistance, we must intensify the mobilization of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support and develop the war behind the enemy lines, and what is particularly important is to concentrate our efforts to crush the treacherous words and actions of the Japanese running dogs and traitors who deceive the people and sell the country.</p>
<h3>A New Educational Method: Improving the Efficiency of Small Group Training; Zhizhong Middle School Essay Competition Team Champion</h3>
<p>— Eagle Team</p>
<p>The more advanced the society, the more collective the work of the people will be, and only collective work can generate huge power. A group is the concentration of huge power, and among the national system, the organization of small groups can be said to be the simplest organization. A small group is like a cell in the human body, and like a small iron ring in a strong iron chain. We can use the principle of cell division and growth and the principle of small iron rings being linked into long iron chains to create and promote the progress of all work. The results obtained in this way will inevitably exceed the total power of the same number of people without organization! It is undoubtedly true that a small group is a good organization.</p>
<p>We understand the meaning of small groups, and we understand that small group training is the correct and progressive educational policy and a correct and progressive learning plan. Then how should we strive for this plan? How to improve the efficiency of small group training?</p>
<p>(1) Implement the spirit of democracy: If a group is required to make progress, then it must establish the spirit of democracy. In the past few weeks of small group training, because the foundation of pre-event publicity and mobilization was not well done, although the small groups had been forcibly organized by the Department of Training in the form of random combinations, we did not feel that each person in a group was connected, and every activity was forced and supervised by the superiors, making us unable to actively and energetically develop our abilities. In order to increase the effectiveness of work, on the one hand, we must establish the democratic spirit of the small groups so that every student can consciously and actively develop each person's creative ability, sense of responsibility, and vitality to work. On the other hand, we must adopt democratic centralism, so as not to go to the extreme of laissez-faire. Such bottom-up activities will definitely progress more than using various methods to supervise and force progress!</p>
<p>(2) Enrich the content of activities: The content of the activities must be closely integrated with the new situation of the current war of resistance. Saving the country and building the country require sound core organizations. In particular, the future masters of the country must have organized training with an active atmosphere. The school should aim to cultivate war of resistance cadres, so that every student studies for the war of resistance, and the competition between groups becomes an automatic, lively, and intense work. After each activity, there should be self-educational reflection, learning from each other's strengths, and helping each other overcome weaknesses. We must not create a tendency towards trophyism. At the same time, we must be able to give equal importance to schoolwork. We must actively strive for both aspects of work, and we must not mechanically separate the importance of each other and suppress any one. If the content of the work is enriched! We believe that if we struggle according to this policy, the efficiency of training will have considerable progress!</p>
<p>(3) Improve the discipline of small groups: The tendency of individual liberalism is absolutely impossible in small groups, so there must be iron discipline to maintain and consolidate the organization of small groups. Discipline is the second life of a circle, and it is the guarantee for the implementation of the route. Without discipline, the development of work cannot be promoted. In the organization and training of small groups, the minority must obey the majority, the individual must obey the group, and the lower level must obey the higher level. This is the manifestation of the spirit of democratic centralism. Every student cannot destroy it, but it is not one-sided commandism. It must be based on the students' awareness. In the past, the small group training of our school was too inclined to commandism. It is hoped that in the future, democratic centralism will be adopted, and every activity will require the students' automatic consciousness.</p>
<p>(4) Establish model small groups; obtain a high-achieving small group from many competitions and make it a model small group for the whole school. Every activity is shouldered by the model small group to take on the active tasks. The model small group is progressive, and all other small groups must catch up. In this way, all work can be carried out quickly with standards and combat effectiveness. The establishment of model small groups in the current situation of our school is extremely rapid. Rapidly build it up.</p>
<p>The above are just my humble opinions on promoting the efficiency of small group training in our school. I hope that enlightened gentlemen will actively teach us for this correct educational policy and strive for the victory of this correct educational policy and fulfill a sacred responsibility for cultivating war of resistance cadres.</p>

Japanese troops have landed in Yuhuan, outside the estuary. After Dinghai was occupied, Japanese planes frequently appeared in the Wenzhou-Taizhou area, bombing and distributing absurd leaflets, claiming they would soon launch an offensive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 27th] At 8:10 AM on the 26th, five Japanese warships, six motorboats, and more than ten civilian boats, under the cover of artillery fire, forcibly landed at Yashan and other places in Kanmen Town, Yuhuan.

The Japanese authorities also stated that Japan cannot be held responsible for any damage to ships caused by these obstacles.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 27th] The British authorities have recently rejected the Japanese request to allow British ships and nationals to evacuate Fuzhou and Wenzhou, as both places are treaty ports and Britons have the right to unlimited access. The British authorities also notified the Japanese side that Japan would be fully responsible for any damage to British lives and property resulting from Japanese military actions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Reports from Shanghai indicate that after Japan ordered American ships in Fuzhou and Wenzhou to leave immediately, American nationals should also evacuate entirely by the 29th. It is learned that Commander Yarnell of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet intends to send a note to the Japanese side, rejecting the demand, using similar language to the rejection of Japan's demands in the Shantou area.</p>
<p>[Local News] Currently, the only foreign warships in Fuzhou harbor are the British warship "Daffodil" and the American warship "Asheville," which is believed to be near Fuzhou. The foreign ship calling at Wenzhou is Jardine Matheson's "Pao Hai" steamer. This ship was scheduled to sail to Hong Kong yesterday afternoon. Jardine Matheson's "Tai Sang" steamer, which leaves Hong Kong at 4 PM today, will still call at Shantou as usual, but whether it will call at Fuzhou will depend on the situation.</p>

Yesterday, the Japanese invited countless students, teachers, merchants, and officials to participate in an anti-British mass rally, but the attempt was a complete failure. Only 500 people attended the rally, and the subsequent parade failed to attract public attention. Newspapers under Japanese control continue to publish anti-British articles, but their rhetoric is no different from before. A letter was received here yesterday from Captain Spire, the British military attaché who was detained by the Japanese army. According to the letter, food and books sent to him had been received, proving that Captain Spire's condition was good. However, there are currently no signs of his release.</p>

<h3>Pen Brigade in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Hai Fan</p>
<p>[Min Ge News Agency, Chengdu Correspondence] The Pen Brigade, a newly established vital force of literary figures from the Chinese Literary Resistance Association, arrived in Chengdu from Chongqing on the 19th. The reporter paid a visit at 9:30 PM on the 21st, inquiring about the team's planned route for this expedition and work plans. Vice Leader Song Zhidi provided the following detailed information:</p>
<p>The Pen Brigade belongs to the Chinese Literary Resistance Association and is a mass organization. Funding is relatively scarce. This trip to the front lines is funded by the Party and Government Committee of the Military Affairs Commission. The original plan was to travel from Chongqing to Chengdu on a transport truck, but due to a lack of vehicles, they switched to a highway bureau vehicle. The connecting tickets have been purchased, and they are preparing to depart from Chengdu to Xi'an soon. Although funding is very difficult, major problems are not expected to arise.</p>
<p>As for the Pen Brigade's organization, Wang Lixi serves as the team leader, with Song as the deputy leader. The team members include Wan Yihong, Yuan Bo, Fang Yin, Luo Feng, Bai Lang, Li Huiying, Zhang Zhou, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Xiaonan, Yang Sao, Ye Yiqun, and Yang Shuo, totaling fourteen people. Among them, Wang Lixi has a multifaceted development in academic cultivation, with in-depth research in literature and social sciences. Yang Sao's poems and plays, Luo Feng's novels, and Qian Xinzhi's essays are all well-known to literary enthusiasts. Others excel in playwriting, critique of women's studies, or poetry and novels, each with their unique strengths. I will not elaborate further. The reporter further inquired about the route of this Pen Brigade expedition. According to Song's response: The planned route for the expedition is to go directly to Xi'an via the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, cross the Yellow River via the Suohai Road, go from the First War Zone to the Second War Zone, and go deep into the various troops in southeastern Shanxi. They will also visit the Taihang Mountains area and the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region to participate in the writings led by Song Zhuwen. Then they will go to Hebei to see the administrative overview and achievements of Guang Zhonglin, then pass through Shandong, and return to Chongqing via the Fifth War Zone, Xiangfan, and Yichang.</p>
<p>The work plan is roughly divided into the following three items:</p>
<p>(1) Bring existing publications and booklets, distribute them to various troops or the masses on the front lines, and use popular and concrete propaganda to make soldiers and the masses deeply understand their own tasks and the situation of the war of resistance. There are many writers currently working in various war zones, and we are very willing to connect with them and help each other.</p>
<p>(2) At the front lines and behind the Japanese lines, use collective interviews and creative methods to collect materials and provide them to the rear. On the one hand, we can also take this opportunity to collect many historical materials on the war of resistance for future creative materials.</p>
<p>(3) Briefly translate the heroic resistance materials and news from our various war zones and publish them abroad, and contact foreign writers to promote the spirit of our people's resistance against Japan. As for the topics to be compiled and sent abroad, it is planned that the Hong Kong office of the Literature Association will receive and forward them abroad. After returning from the expedition, we plan to publish a special issue with the materials collected from all parties for the readers. At this point in the conversation, all the team members had returned to the team, and visitors and farewell-senders successively left, so the reporter also said goodbye.</p>
<p>As the reporter walked alone, thinking of the Pen Brigade of the Literary Resistance Association, they were able to sweep away the old habit of literary flourish. With a spirit of perseverance and hard work, they actually went to the battlefield. This kind of spirit and courage is truly exciting and admirable. We hope that the Pen Brigade, this vital force, will work hard on its own position to carry out enlightenment education. We hope that they will use their pens on the cultural front to crush the cultural invasion conspiracy of the Japanese and the puppet organizations, and use the power of the pen to cooperate with the military power to attack the Japanese. They have already bravely set off for the battlefield, and we wish them success with high enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Shantou City: An Eyewitness Account of the Japanese Plundering of Shantou</h3>
<p>— Special Article by Our Newspaper (2) Lin Gao</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, people near the pier were running towards the center of the street. Two Japanese planes then landed on the water. I couldn't believe it and ran to the coast to see. The Japanese planes were still flying overhead.</p>
<p>People carrying boxes and bags hurried into Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. I stood at its door, wondering what was happening.</p>
<p>A relative forcefully pulled me inside, saying seriously, urgently, and frantically: "What are you doing running around in the street when the planes are flying so low!"</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. was crowded with people and luggage, in a state of chaos, sweat, and heavy breathing.</p>
<p>"The Japanese flag is flying on Mount Ma'an!"</p>
<p>"Ten enemy warships are sailing into Ma'an Estuary!" News spread.</p>
<p>The crowd squeezed out of the gate, ran across the pier, and boarded the "Yingzhou Wheel." Mount Jiaoshi on the opposite shore lay heavily, its peaks lined up on either side. At the eastern end of this line, four small black dots looked like bird droppings. These black dots were slowly moving and growing! Anger and terror also grew accordingly.</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock, ferocious warships, flying the banner of scattered blood droplets, sailed past the Yingzhou Wheel.</p>
<p>"Boom, boom, boom—boom, boom, boom!" The sound of cannons rang out, and cruel bombing began. Soil and sand sprayed up in heaps, each explosion causing pain in the chest.</p>
<p>Japanese gray-black motorboats scurried on the sea, armored, uncovered, like rats, searching for food. Large wooden boats, small motorboats, and customs patrol boats, which had been moored near the mountains to avoid Japanese aircraft strafing and bombing, were all taken away by them and also displayed that glaring banner of scattered blood droplets. However, they absolutely dared not approach the shore.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>A gray small boat, with a layer of iron wrapped around the front, sprayed white water waves on both sides, and ferociously sailed to the pier of the Water Police Bureau.</p>
<p>The heartstrings on the ship seemed to swell and tighten, as fierce fighting was about to begin.</p>
<p>However, two Japanese soldiers who crawled out of the boat, wearing dark green uniforms, stood up, carrying a glaring banner, looked around, climbed up the pier, preparing to insert the flag. But, suddenly, they shrank their necks, and hurriedly fled back to the boat, causing the small boat to sway greatly, and tend to escape towards the sea.</p>
<p>The "Imperial Army" is as timid as rats.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Puff, puff, puff!</p>
<p>Cannon fire and smoke emanated from the reinforced concrete gun emplacement in the eastern corner of the Chaohai Customs pier, and murderous bullets assaulted it like a torrential rain. On the walls of the customs inspection yard behind, many holes had been opened.</p>
<p>A soldier in a camouflage uniform, holding a rifle, his left hand drooping, slipped past the wall. People and artillery shells continued to raise against the wall, dirt clods and smoke kept shooting down from the heap behind the stacks. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Hull States: British and American Consultation; Discussion on Addressing Far East Situation; Rumor of Consideration to Dispatch Ships Eastward</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 26th) Secretary of State Hull, in responding to a reporter's question at a press conference today regarding whether the United States is considering taking broader action in the Far East, stated that he had no preconceived notions. Regarding the Swatow incident, the situation has recently calmed down, so the American marines who had landed in Swatow have returned to their warships. Hull also said that American representatives are currently in London consulting with the British government on all matters and continuously exchanging information with each other.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 26th) According to an article in "The Washington Star," Washington is reportedly discussing the possibility of dispatching the American fleet to the Far East to "curb aggression." The article's author stated, "Given that the British and French navies have a tacit understanding regarding the European theater, then, in terms of using force to promote the rights of democratic nations in the Far East, the United States should shoulder the main responsibility." The commentator continued, "President Theodore Roosevelt dispatched a fleet on a world tour in 1907, with Japan as its specific target. Whether this can be done again is now under consideration." Political circles have not commented on the above proposal. However, in the past, when the Far East situation was tense, naval authorities discussed moving the fleet to Hawaii or Manila. Sources claim that the government is most concerned with the amendment of the Neutrality Act and hopes to avoid any action that could hinder the passage of the amendment. However, anyone who says that the United States is too busy with domestic affairs to be concerned with foreign affairs and tries to take advantage of this is greatly mistaken.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 27th) The Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee held a meeting last night to discuss the Tianjin issue. The British ambassador to Japan will soon submit a report to the British government regarding the attitude of the Japanese government. It is rumored that the British government intends to hold a naval demonstration in the Far East. It is understood that the British government can certainly dispatch warships to the Far East, but the effectiveness of the fleet if it is not substantial is questionable.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Labor MP Fletcher asked in the House of Commons how the Swatow situation affects British shipping and trade between Hong Kong and Swatow. Undersecretary Butler replied that the impact on British shipping is still unclear. Although the local situation is chaotic, British naval authorities are doing their utmost to secure the free movement of British ships. It is too early to discuss the impact of the Swatow incident on British trade in Hong Kong, but the authorities are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 27th] After the conclusion of the British-French joint defense conference here, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, Noble, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, McNiece, will leave for Hong Kong tonight. Today, Noble and the Director of the Australian Navy, Colvin, had lunch together. When meeting with Reuters reporters, he said that Australia is paying close attention to the British-French talks. He also presented the results of the Pacific defense conference held recently in New Zealand and discussed them with Noble. Colvin is scheduled to depart for London on Friday to report the results of the two conferences to the Admiralty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Former Director of Naval Intelligence, Vice-Admiral Osbert, recently gave a broadcast address on the topic of Pacific defense, stating that if war breaks out between Britain and Japan, China will automatically become an ally of Britain. China can easily obtain assistance through railways, aviation, and highways, and thus China's resistance will become stronger, while Japan will be exhausted and ultimately defeated. Fortunately, both Britain and Japan are willing to resolve various disputes through agreements, so war between the two countries may not occur. In his opinion, Britain, France, and the United States should form a conference in the Far East. When necessary, they can jointly send a note to Japan, which Japan would not dare to ignore, because the combined military strength of the three countries is too strong for Japan to provoke.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th] The Admiralty recently issued a statement stating that the summer leave for officers and men of the ships under its command will be brought forward from July so that the ships can be docked for repairs in July. The exercises can then be brought forward to August. The original plan for the ships to sail to a certain place north of the main base in mid-July has also been cancelled. The Navy Week, which is held at the beginning of August every year, will also be cancelled this year. Members of Parliament have commented on this matter, saying that according to German sources, the international situation may become extremely tense again in the second half of August. The Admiralty is taking precautions and has decided to bring forward the date of naval exercises (held in September last year) in order to prepare for the worst possible situation, so that there is the greatest hope of safeguarding peace.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Negotiations: Prospects Gradually Optimistic; Rumor that Britain is Prepared to Accept Soviet Demands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Prime Minister Chamberlain recently stated in the House of Commons that the government will send new instructions to Ambassador Seeds regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] According to various newspapers here today, the British government has decided to prepare to accept all Soviet demands. The Foreign Policy Committee held a meeting for an hour and a half and instructed Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again to indicate that Britain is prepared to agree to offer guarantees to the three Baltic states. This guarantee will be included in an annex to the Anglo-Soviet agreement but will not be published. The British government is also prepared to begin staff talks immediately after the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet agreement. Political circles here believe that under these circumstances, the Anglo-Soviet agreement will certainly be completed in the near future. "The Daily Mail" stated, "The British government wishes to see the Anglo-Soviet negotiations completed quickly, and the Soviet Union shares this wish."</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Intensifying Brewing of New Conspiracy; Germany Secretly Training Special Forces; Scheduled to Enter Danzig at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] Diplomatic circles here have recently obtained information from abroad that the totalitarian countries are actively engaging in military activities, similar to what they did before the previous European crises, indicating that the international situation will face another crisis in a few weeks. This can be seen in the following matters: (1) Before the signing of the German-Italian military alliance treaty, German Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Mendel and Italian Undersecretary of the Army Balia held talks in Innsbruck. Until recently, German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder and Italian Undersecretary of the Navy Gavagnari also held talks in Friedrichshafen, Germany, to discuss cooperation between the two navies. As for cooperation between the air forces, German Aviation Minister Goering is also holding talks with Italian Undersecretary of Aviation Valle. (2) German-Italian military measures have been extended to Africa. German Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch went to Italian Somaliland in North Africa to lay the foundation for joint German-Italian action in North Africa. (3) Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio recently inspected defenses in Albania and has now returned to Rome. There are now 120,000 Italian troops stationed in Albania, which was occupied by Italy. (4) The Italian Navy's First Fleet, including the battleships Cavour and Giulio Cesare, ten cruisers, and more than twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, is conducting a "symbolic cruise" in the Atlantic Ocean. The Second Fleet will sail east on July 1st to Libya, Albania, and the Aegean Sea. In practice, the Italian Navy is about to be fully mobilized. (5) The Italian Army is about to hold large-scale exercises in the north. (6) The German Army will have 1.4 million personnel this summer. There are now 200,000 workers rushing to build fortifications along the German-Polish border, which is a clear threat to the Free City of Danzig. The re-emergence of tension in the European situation can be seen in the above.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Danzig, 27th] The Germans have started to organize special forces in Danzig, with key members being the shock troops, Blackshirts, and Hitler Youth. The organization method is exactly the same as that used by Germany before annexing the Sudetenland. Young people aged 16 to 20 have been conscripted and sent to East Prussia and other parts of Germany for two weeks of rigorous training. The location of the training is kept secret. The trainees are scheduled to return here on July 1st. Sixteen barracks have been built here for the use of the special forces.</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Continue to Insult Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] A certain newspaper here is encouraging the Japanese to insult British residents in Tianjin. The newspaper claimed that British national power is weakening, its position in China and Palestine is becoming increasingly precarious and subject to humiliation, and even London is threatened by anti-British activities by the Irish Republican Army. In the event of war, Britain will not be able to resist.</p>
<h3>France and the United States Supplying Japan with Military Supplies; US Sells Large Quantities of Aircraft to Japan; France Also Supplies Japan with War Materials</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The US Department of Commerce recently released statistics on aircraft exports, stating that in the first five months of this year, aircraft exports totaled only $38,247,052, of which Japan purchased over $1 million worth.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to the new trade agreement signed between Japan and France on the 13th of this month, Japan has switched from importing luxury goods from France to purchasing "essential goods." Japan will purchase approximately £2.3 million worth of iron machinery and chemical raw materials from France in the coming year, while purchases of spices, cosmetics, and alcohol will be discontinued. France will purchase canned tuna, carp, porcelain, and cotton textiles from Japan.</p>
<h3>British and French Public Opinion Unanimously Hardline</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent Bartley stated that the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee met tonight and believes that the Japanese anti-British movement in Tianjin can be ended, but only under certain conditions. Britain should strengthen China's currency, as this is the best way to force Tokyo to change its policy. The newspaper's editorial also urged the government to provide large-scale financial and economic assistance to China, saying, "There is a real danger that if we do not retaliate against Japan's provocations, the Nazis may think that we can also be despised in Europe." The "Daily Herald" urged housewives across the country to stop buying Japanese goods, as this would let the Japanese government know that there is no benefit to pursuing a policy of insulting others. The "Manchester Guardian" stated, "Britain's most important ally in the Far East is China, not France or the United States. Many of the retaliatory steps under consideration involve restricting the import of Japanese goods into the British Empire, but we should not forget that assisting China is also a retaliatory step. We can provide China with loans, aircraft, and tanks, which is not the least effective." "Our real front line in the Far East is not Tianjin, Hong Kong, or Singapore, but the Northwest and South China areas."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The "Financial News" wrote yesterday that it is difficult to determine what benefits the government can gain from its policy of procrastination. However, the world is watching the position taken by Britain in the Far East dispute. If it fails, Britain's credibility will be seriously damaged and difficult to restore. Therefore, the time for compromise has passed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] London dispatch: Newspapers here unanimously advocate that Britain should take immediate action on the Tianjin incident. The "Sunday Pictorial" stated that British Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that Britain could not accept Japanese domination, but in fact Japan has further insulted Britain. The "Sunday Express" stated that there are 50,000 Japanese merchants in Britain. If Britain imposes a blockade on them, the blow they suffer will be much greater than the insults that Japan has inflicted on British residents in Tianjin. The "Sunday Times" stated that Britain should adopt a firm and calm policy and consider mediation if there is a possibility of it. If one responds to this matter with excessive emotion, one must be careful not to fall into Hitler's conspiracy. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that the government should know that if the government is determined to resist aggression, the entire nation will stand behind it. The British Prime Minister's expression of indignation at the Japanese military's humiliation of British residents reflects the unanimous assessment of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Newspapers here are commenting on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the 24th. Pardonnaux wrote in "L'Ordre," "It would be better if Mr. Chamberlain temporarily shelved the attempt at appeasement and first formed an agreement with the Soviet Union." Mrs. Tabouis also wrote in "L'Oeuvre," "Germany's response to Mr. Chamberlain's speech has once again proved that Germany will not change its resolve." "La République" stated, "Germany's response to Mr. Chamberlain's speech is to make France believe that British-French cooperation is tantamount to trapping France in a subordinate position, in order to make France leave the alliance later. However, if France must eventually become a vassal, it is better to be a vassal of Britain than a vassal of Germany."</p>
<h3>Tianjin Incident to Be Resolved in Tokyo; Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Secretary; Urges British Government to Pay Attention to Tianjin Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent reports that after the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee met tonight to reconsider the Far East situation, the government may soon announce the start of negotiations with Tokyo. The committee will also discuss the situation of the talks with the Soviet Union. It is understood that the new instructions mentioned by Chamberlain today have not yet been issued because these instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] As a result of the meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, the Japanese side has agreed to hold formal talks in Tokyo. Therefore, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's report to Parliament yesterday expressed optimism. The government believes that Japan's willingness to use Tokyo as the negotiation location, rather than Tianjin, is a good sign, as holding the meeting in Tokyo can reduce the pressure from the Japanese military. Neutral observers generally agree with this view. The British Defense Committee held a special meeting yesterday to discuss Sir Noble's report on the Singapore conference. It is said that Britain will send a large fleet to the Far East as a demonstration. The British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, and Guo called the British authorities' attention to the relationship between the Tianjin incident and the Nine-Power Treaty, as China is also one of the signatories to the treaty.</p>
<h3>Butler Speaks at the Imperial Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Undersecretary Butler delivered a speech to the Imperial Press Conference today, discussing the establishment of the External Publicity Department, stating, "Our purpose is not to engage in any unfounded propaganda, but to promote our own views." He then described the British government's foreign policy, saying, "Under the provisions of the League of Nations system, peaceful change is possible. We are not opposed to any change, but we are opposed to change achieved by force."</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes Currency Amendment</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The Senate today passed a currency amendment increasing the price of newly minted domestic silver to US$0.774 per ounce. The Treasury Department can only profit 40 percent from purchasing domestic silver. The Senate also passed an amendment eliminating the Treasury Department's power to purchase silver abroad.</p>
<h3>Japan Today</h3>
<p>— Shichang</p>
<p>Japan's war of aggression against China will soon reach two years. China's unity and resistance against foreign aggression is something Japan did not expect. Recently, the Japanese army occupied Swatow, which on the surface seems to be another so-called "victory" for Japan. However, let's take a look at Japan today:</p>
<p>Soon after the outbreak of this war, Japan felt the pain. The armaments accumulated over many years were being turned to ashes, and most of them were intended to deal with a formidable enemy - the Soviet Union. The lack of currency and raw materials is an inherent phenomenon of wartime economic contraction, which is not surprising. However, in Japan today, all industries are depressed, people are suffering, and danger is everywhere. Now, let's briefly discuss food, materials, commerce, and finance.</p>
<p>Food - The government has implemented controls on milk, butter, eggs, and other major foods. The cost of food has increased by an average of 13 percent in one year, and by 23 percent since July 7, 1937.</p>
<p>Materials - Iron utensils and old razor blades are being collected and melted to make armaments. Silk and wool clothing have disappeared in the retail market. The Japanese government is preparing to replace silk fabrics with rayon, but without success.</p>
<p>Commerce - The government has instructed banks to reduce interest rates on small loans and control prices, but has not controlled salaries. Therefore, millions of large and small merchants have suffered losses and gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>Finance - The instability of Japan's financial foundation is well known. Recently, the sharp drop in the yen was not accidental. Recently, the Japanese Minister of Finance expressed "disappointment" with the metallurgical industry in 1938, which was not without reason. In April of this year, Japan did not have a penny left to buy war materials from the United States.</p>
<p>From the above situation, we can clearly find two points: First, Japan's gold reserves are about to be exhausted; second, inflation, if not true inflation, is gradually unfolding in Japan. The wartime problems in Japan are extremely serious.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>Brief comment</p>
<h3>× Covets Fuzhou and Wenzhou</h3>
<p>After forcibly occupying Swatow, the Japanese × have now advanced to Chaozhou. At the same time, they landed on the Zhoushan Islands and forcibly occupied Dinghai. According to last night's news, the Japanese × have also attempted to advance on Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Thus, the coastal situation is once again tense.</p>
<p>The Japanese × are one of the three major naval powers in the world, with a strong modern navy. China has no navy, so at the beginning of the war of resistance, it was prepared to exchange space for time, consume the × army's combat power, and strive for final victory. The coastal areas have long been prepared. The Japanese × 's invasion of our coast is not surprising. However, the fact that they have started a large-scale invasion at a time when the Japanese × 's war of aggression against China is encountering unprecedented difficulties is enough to expose their ugliness!</p>
<p>× 's harassment of the coast is to coordinate political offensives, especially economic offensives. The reasons have been seen in today's editorial. The significance lies first in threatening Britain, and secondly in our inland production and × rear combat troops. As for our countermeasures, they lie in strengthening the guerrilla war in the × rear, and combating all traitors and puppet organizations, while stepping up the promotion of the anti-aggression movement in the Far East, especially the aid-China and ban-Japan movement.</p>
<p>The Japanese × 's harassment of the coast is only a desperate struggle at the end of their rope. Not only can they not threaten us, but they can also increase our belief in adhering to the war of resistance and winning. The mountains of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces will be the Japanese × 's final tomb!</p>
<h3>An Oriental Drama: Searching for Gold</h3>
<p>The Japanese × 's invasion of China has encountered great difficulties, so they are extremely vicious and their poisonous flames are high. On the one hand, they are stepping up the destruction and robbery of all British rights and interests in China (such as the recent blockade of Tianjin and the forced occupation of Swatow, advancing on Qianzhou and Wenzhou, etc.), on the other hand, they are making a pretense of attacking Soviet Outer Mongolia and exaggerating propaganda of "good news." Here, we would like to ask readers to pay attention to the fact that Britain and Japan are conducting negotiations in Tokyo! Who are the Japanese × putting on these tricks for? Isn't it clear yet? Aren't the Japanese × 's desperate and fierce looks clear yet?</p>
<p>Today there is also news from Tokyo that the Japanese government will start gold registration on July 1st, and all foreign residents must register their gold savings. Here we can see the truth about the Japanese × 's empty treasury and their urgent attempt to search the people for gold! In fact, the property of the Japanese people has long been transformed into the fierce weapons of the Japanese army's invasion of China through various means. This time the search for gold is mainly aimed at foreigners. "Do not dwell in a dangerous country." We see that the Japanese × 's situation will become even more isolated and dangerous. We don't know how those who have been frantically exaggerating the Japanese × 's military strength will show their ugly faces.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Puppet Border: Continued Air Battles; 25 Japanese Aircraft Shot Down; Japanese Side Again Makes Mythical Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 26th] Semi-official sources recently received news from the Soviet-Mongolian Army Headquarters in Outer Mongolia that 60 Japanese fighters invaded Outer Mongolia near Lake Ber and engaged in fierce air combat with 50 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft near Mongoliliba for two hours. 25 Japanese aircraft were shot down, and the remaining 35 fled immediately. Soviet-Mongolian aircraft chased them to Ganjur Monastery before returning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, 26th] According to news from Tokyo and Moscow, fierce air battles have broken out again on the Outer Mongolian border. According to the Soviet announcement, 60 Japanese aircraft that invaded Mongolian territory were intercepted by 50 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft. As a result, 25 Japanese aircraft were shot down and three Soviet aircraft were missing. According to Japanese propaganda, 60 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft fought with three Japanese aircraft, resulting in six Soviet-Mongolian aircraft being shot down in half an hour, while the Japanese aircraft returned safely. Both the Soviet and Japanese sides said that they had driven the other side's aircraft out of the territory.</p>

<h3>The Two Tyrants of Danzig: A Chronicle of the Nazi Officialdom</h3>
<p>Although many large countries have one tyrannical ruler, the small Free City of Danzig actually has two: one is Senate President Greiser, and the other is Forster, the head of the Nazi branch.</p>
<p>Both are devoted Nazi lackeys, but they are deeply hostile towards each other. In fact, both have nothing to do with Danzig; they are all outsiders who barged in. The tall Greiser is from western Poland, while the long, eagle-eyed Forster was born near Nuremberg.</p>
<p>Greiser is forty-four years old this year, more than ten years older than Forster; however, despite his advanced age, he is still Forster's subordinate in the Nazi Party. Therefore, in Danzig, Greiser must yield to Forster everywhere.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Forster was already shouting "Heil Hitler," while Greiser was still working dutifully as a clerk in a Jewish shop. When he came to Danzig, he only carried a medal he had won in the Great War, claiming to be a skilled pilot. Forster was even more pathetic when he arrived; wearing ragged pants and a hungry stomach, he wandered around aimlessly, eventually becoming a minor official.</p>
<p>Now? Greiser has an inexhaustible supply of checks, while Forster owns many magnificent properties around Danzig. Both are greedy for money, but Greiser is a big spender, while Forster is a miser.</p>
<p>Greiser became famous in Danzig for his numerous scandals. Forster rose to prominence after attacking Hindenburg, which cost him his official position.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he had suffered enough in the Jewish shop, Greiser became an expert in anti-Semitism. The previous President of Danzig, Dr. Rauschning, was ousted by Hitler for his insufficient anti-Semitism, and Greiser was appointed in his place.</p>
<p>Forster, on the other hand, came to Danzig to be a petty emperor because of a recommendation from Hitler's sister.</p>
<p>Greiser is a devoted follower of Goering; he even considers himself somewhat like Marshal Goering. Therefore, he imitates Goering in everything: wearing uniforms, hunting, and even having the same fondness for wearing medals. It is said that because he did not have enough medals himself, he even hung up his father's Red Cross medal, earned in the Franco-Prussian War. He often dresses in full military attire and walks down the street, only happy when people call him "Captain" instead of "Mr. President."</p>
<p>Forster is the complete opposite; he follows the principle of imitating Hitler. However, he did get married. His father-in-law is an architect, and as a result, all the public buildings in Danzig have been rebuilt.</p>
<p>Neither of them is well-liked in Danzig. Greiser is slightly better at it, able to give speeches for an hour or two, stirring up the emotions. Perhaps because he is still Polish, and retains a bit of conscience, he is relatively kind to the Poles and to the League of Nations' administrative committee, which is something Forster vehemently attacks. Sometimes, Greiser will also "go among the people" to chat and joke with them: in Forster's eyes, this is too vulgar and should never be done.</p>
<p>There cannot be two suns in the sky; that is undoubtedly true. How can this small Danzig accommodate two tyrants? Therefore, the constant squabbling has become commonplace. You will often see Forster storming out of the Senate in a rage, forgetting his hat; then, Greiser throws his hat out after him. Similarly, in public, you will see Greiser refuse to shake hands with Forster.</p>
<p>After arguing, Forster always runs to Hitler to complain, while Greiser seeks out Goering and Goebbels to pour out his grievances. In the end, Forster usually prevails.</p>
<p>Greiser has already been summoned by Hitler and reprimanded twice, told that his attitude is too weak and that he will be dismissed if he continues in this way. Goering and Goebbels can only sigh in vain. And Forster naturally becomes even more arrogant and domineering.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the near future, Danzig will become a one-tyrant state.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The Japanese are most proud of the excellence of their domestic police administration, and that is indeed true. The stalking skills of Japanese secret detectives and the arrest capabilities of the royal military police are truly outstanding. If you don't believe it, please see below:</p>
<p>Once, a prisoner escaped from a jail in a small town near Tokyo. The police chief immediately sent eight photographs of the escaped prisoner in different poses to the neighboring police station, requesting their assistance in capturing him. The next day, he received a telegram in reply:</p>
<p>"Seven of them have been captured, and the remaining one is expected to be apprehended within days."</p>

<h3>Maritime Storm</h3>
<p>— By Lieutenant Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previously excerpted: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship 'Königberg' was carrying six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Chooks Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel in Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wildly without a destination. Soon, a message came through the wireless that there was an iceberg nearby. Fortunately, the iceberg soon slipped past, but shortly after, a British warship came to intercept them and opened fire, hitting the stern. However, fortunately, fog descended...</p>
<p>"That's right, this game of hide-and-seek in the fog is driving me crazy." Bill grumbled.</p>
<p>At dusk, the ship had passed through the fog, but every eye was anxiously watching, fearing that another black hunting dog of the British would emerge from the gray sea and sky.</p>
<p>However, they did not encounter anything like that again, although, in the evening, far to the east of their route, they could see the searchlights of cruisers, white beams like fingers stretching out, searching everywhere. The next day passed peacefully again. On the morning of the third day, when a faint dawn appeared in the sky, Jack poked his head out of the wireless room and discovered that their ship was heading towards a strange, peculiar, and crude coastline.</p>
<p>At this time, the passengers began to stir. Approaching the edge of the coast, they gradually saw small huts and wooden houses. While they were having breakfast, the ship entered a port, and the anchor dropped with a rumble. The people in the dining room suddenly emptied out and rushed to the deck.</p>
<p>"Why, that house looks exactly like my home in White Harbor," a woman exclaimed.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, it was proven that she was not mistaken. This place was indeed White Harbor in the United States. The captain, because he dared not sail to New York or Boston, chose this world-famous summer resort, a place that British cruisers would not pay much attention to. Sure enough, his calculation was correct. The "gold ship" had finally arrived safely at a paradise after some risks. After the ship was moored, almost all the passengers went ashore an hour later. They were all busy sending telegrams, reporting their safe arrival everywhere.</p>
<p>Wireless broadcasts traveled thousands of miles, and everyone knew that the ship had arrived safely. A few days ago, the news of the "gold ship" going missing had indeed kept people busy for a while. The newspapers published many speculative dangers, saying that she had been captured and entered a British port; or that she had sunk, with all the cargo lost, but no one guessed that the "gold ship" had actually slipped back on the treacherous seas.</p>
<p>The next day, Jack Red and Bill Nanno Rumongalo stayed in a hotel. Jack received a telegram from Mr. Chooks, which read: Glad to hear you are safe and sound. Come to my office for a discussion when you get to New York. There is an important matter to discuss.</p>
<p>"What's it about again?" Jack asked Bill in surprise.</p>
<p>"I don't have the slightest idea," Bill said, "but I have a feeling that your vacation is over."</p>
<p>"You can still call it a vacation," Jack laughed.</p>
<p>"That's right, perhaps 'experience' is a more appropriate word," Bill also laughed.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The Tianjin issue has been deadlocked for a long time. The British have talked about it again and again, negotiated again and again, stopping and starting, with no result. Yesterday's news said that the British government will announce formal negotiations with Japan. What does this mean?</p>
<p>You should believe it now. Military affairs are a comprehensive conspiracy of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Japan performs on stage, while Germany and Italy cheer from the sidelines. An Italian newspaper says: The old empire is shaking. Goebbels says: Britain has no real strength to back it up. Well, let the appeasement policy appease these cries!</p>
<p>News has come that Britain is preparing to intensify negotiations with the Soviet Union and will agree to all the Soviet Union's conditions. Hopefully, it will materialize soon. A wise man adapts to the times.</p>
<p>Our port is increasing the number of reserve police. Amitabha, good, good. I hope it will be filled soon, trained, and show the thieves a little color. Long live the police!</p>
<p>It costs two yuan for an epidemic prevention fee to go to Macau, and it actually costs a hundred yuan in security deposit to go to Annam. Since the fall of Guangzhou, entering the country has become a necessary route. Those who have gone through it are complaining endlessly. Now, to ask for a security deposit seems too "that." If the matter is true, I hope the diplomatic authorities will come up with a proper solution.</p>
<p>Opening a newspaper, the front page is advertising "Naked Country Scenery" starring Chen Shachang, etc. The second page is "Chen Yunshang's Announcement," denying that she has starred in "Naked Country Scenery." The world of the twentieth century, the world of advertising, the world of business eyes.</p>

<h3>International Exchange Center Unchanged Shanghai Still Holds Financial Hub Industrial, Commercial and Real Estate Quite Active Mainland Funds Return to Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>5.  Interbank Lending</p>
<p>Since August 17 of last year, the Association has been handling interbank remittances and lending. At that time, the Shanghai war had just begun, and banks needed a large amount of money to prepare for withdrawals. Therefore, the amount of lending gradually increased, reaching a maximum of more than 8.34 million yuan. This year, due to the increase in deposits in various banks, the capital of banks is more abundant than before. The Association's lending amount has gradually decreased. At the end of June, the Association's lending balance was 4,513,608 yuan in national currency. At the end of the year, the lending balance was 3,740,800 yuan. The average lending rate for the whole year was 22%. The Association's interbank remittances and lending were originally complementary to the head payments and remittance lending handled by the four banks of the Central Bank. This year, in order to concentrate on dealing with the situation, most of the applications for lending from various banks were entrusted to the Association by the four banks. The amount of lending and the collateral were still jointly approved by the four banks. As of the end of the year, the Association's lending totaled 1,620,000 yuan in national currency, including 600,000 yuan for head payments and 1,020,000 yuan for remittance payments.</p>
<p>6.  Remittance Discount</p>
<p>Since there was a fact of remittance discounts in the market, the discount per thousand yuan was initially only 6 or 7 yuan. Since the government announced foreign exchange control in March, the discount gradually rose to 30 or 40 yuan. At the same time, the demand for legal tender increased day by day, and the legal tender in circulation in the market became increasingly scarce. In April, the Association was entrusted by the Central Bank to try to adjust the situation in moderation, but for a time there was still not enough supply. On June 7, the discount per thousand yuan rose to as high as 79 yuan. At that time, the Association was entrusted by the Central Bank to maintain the situation as much as possible, and the market discount rate was stabilized at around 50 yuan. The process is as described above. In November, Wuhan fell one after another, and people were uneasy. The rate rose again to more than 60 yuan, but soon returned to about 45 yuan. At the end of the year, it fell to 38 or 39 yuan, and the market has shown a stable trend. The Association's discount rate for remittance bills is determined by the Association's temporary review of the market, in consultation with the three banks.</p>
<p>7.  Interbank Deposits</p>
<p>This year, banks, trust companies, and money shops other than exchange banks have opened accounts with the Association for the purpose of loan settlement or to facilitate the collection of bills. These deposits are listed in the interbank deposit accounts in the Association's balance sheet. At the end of the year, the total deposit balance was 7,523,297.36 yuan, of which head deposits accounted for 35.19% and remittance deposits accounted for 64.81%.</p>
<p>(B) Bill Exchange Department</p>
<p>1. Exchange Banks</p>
<p>Due to environmental reasons, the Bank suspended business on February 5 of this year and stopped its bill exchange from the same day. After the Guangdong Bank was reorganized and resumed business last year, it was originally exchanged by the Association. On March 1 of this year, it joined as an exchange bank. On July 4, the Coal Industry Bank and Zhengming Bank simultaneously entrusted the Association to exchange. On October 4, Hengli Bank was reorganized and resumed business, and from the same day entrusted the Association to exchange. On November 21, Tonghe Bank announced its closure and withdrew from the exchange. This year, branches of various banks in the city have still been reduced or merged. As of the end of the year, the Association still has 36 exchange banks and 10 banks that entrust the Association to exchange, an increase of one from last year. There are 77 branches of various banks in the city participating in the exchange, a decrease of 11 from last year. The total number of exchanges for the whole year was 2,176,344,120.89 yuan in national currency and 1,423,501 bills. Compared with 1937, the amount decreased by 62.53% and the number of bills decreased by 40%. The average daily exchange amount this year was 7,352,513.93 yuan in national currency and 4,809 bills. The exchange amount on January 29 reached 64,286,55,631 yuan, and the number of exchange documents on October 11 reached 13,608, both of which were the highest records for this year.

<h3>Reflections on the Sixth Performance of the Chinese Arts Troupe</h3>
<p>— Yang Ouyuqian</p>
<p>Originally, the Chinese Arts Troupe counted each rehearsal of a new script as a performance. However, this calculation was quite troublesome. Therefore, starting from this time, the method will be changed. Hereafter, each staging will be counted as a performance. - This time, the Cantonese group is the first performance, and the Mandarin group is the eighteenth performance.</p>
<p>Looking at the economic situation and material equipment of the Chinese Arts Troupe, not only can it not perform charity like Ms. Lin Meiqi, but even the rent of the venue is personally assumed. Such a heroic act means that each performance must go through many difficult plans to be barely realized.</p>
<p>This time, it can be regarded as acting through, and everyone is very happy. It does not matter whether the performance is good or bad, as long as the work that should be done is done within the possible range. Performing once at a time, advancing the work step by step, this is the attitude taken by the Chinese Arts Troupe at the current stage.</p>
<p>What we support is the War of Resistance and nation-building. The so-called drama work is the expression of every dramatist dedicating their spirit and physical strength to the War of Resistance and nation-building. We can use all kinds of methods—direct, indirect, linear, curved, roaring, gentle, straightforward, roundabout, encouraging, satirical, whole, fragmented—to promote the War of Resistance. At the same time, we must also gradually establish China's emerging drama in the work with a research, accumulation, open-minded, and constructive attitude and spirit.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is long-term, and nation-building also requires a considerable period. Therefore, drama work is long-term, and the establishment of emerging drama is not a short-term matter. We must use all our energy to advance the work to the predetermined goal, and we must irrigate the buds of this emerging drama with all our energy to make them grow and develop.</p>
<p>Our work is long-term, so we must prepare for the long term. We must identify an ideal goal, follow certain steps, and thoroughly advocate with constant effort. In the progress of work, we must never think this way for a while and that way for another.</p>
<p>It is not certain that every play we put on is popular, and it is not certain that every tune we sing is equally high. There are bound to be occasional mistakes and failures in strategy. As long as we have a clear understanding of the principles and propositions and grasp them firmly, we don't need to take temporary gains and losses to heart. The most important thing is: do not cover up mistakes, and do not go around the bush to ask for understanding; do not cover up failures, just pay attention at any time and improve at any time. The more tempering of gains and losses, the more solid the career can be developed.</p>
<p>The Chinese Arts Troupe was established in Hong Kong, and the work naturally starts from Hong Kong. There are more than one million compatriots here. If we don't regard them as uncivilized, it may not be considered meaningless to perform a few more meaningful plays for them here. Many people come from the mainland and have been threatened by war and bombing. Although Hong Kong has not been bombed at the moment, the various difficulties in doing drama work here may not be able to crush a person's fragile heart.</p>
<p>The drama troupes staying in Hong Kong may as well talk more to the audience in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and give them more comfort and stimulation. If they think it is necessary to supplement the content, they may as well use the space and time here to supplement it well. If it is necessary to go to the mainland, there is no hesitation in going to the mainland, just as the drama troupes in the mainland should leave the mainland when necessary. Leaving the mainland has its own mission, and returning to the mainland is not to create qualifications in the bombing.</p>
<p>At present, the drama propaganda teams working in the mainland, only those directly under the Political Department of the Military Commission, have forty or so teams assigned to work in various war zones. Their organization is of course completely different from that of professional theater groups. There is much in their experience that can be used for our reference and learning, but there are also many places where they need to ask for advice from experienced and trained professional theater groups. For example, there is a great lack of directors. If there are people who can act and direct, they are needed everywhere. Another thing is the script. In the mainland, acting is used for propaganda, which is mostly mobile performances. There is no need for a large number of new scripts like in Hong Kong. However, the current situation has changed somewhat. Because in order to make the members of the performing troupe and the local people in the war zone become one and have close contact, each performing troupe has to stay in the war zone for a relatively long time. If they perform the same script every day, wouldn't it be boring? So I also hope that the production of scripts will increase. These may be divided into labor and cooperation, and the writers in the rear can work hard. If a writer is urgently needed in the front to supplement, he should immediately carry his gun and go to the battlefield. Otherwise, he can be left in the rear to work hard and write. It's just like skilled workers, they take guns when they need to take guns, and increase production in the rear when they don't grab guns. If drama workers in Hong Kong can unite, strengthen organization and training, and establish communication with drama workers in the mainland, discuss and help each other, there will be considerable achievements. However, this kind of thing also needs a dedicated person to preside over it, and it also needs considerable funding. It is true that drama workers in Hong Kong are too poor, but they cannot wait until they have money to do it. They can only do it and then see. If someone initiates and organizes, the Chinese Arts Troupe will definitely follow.</p>
<p>As for charity performances, it is not originally the task of drama workers themselves. For the sake of relief and fundraising, it should naturally be done. Before this performance of the Chinese Arts Troupe, there were two charity performances. After the performance, there will be another charity performance immediately. Isn't it also good to indirectly help refugees and wounded soldiers? But it's just a very plain thing. At this moment, it is always good to do more for the society. It's just that drama workers often put a lot of effort into achieving their own tasks, but the results they get are not as satisfactory as expected. This is worth adding to the training effort.</p>
<p>The Chinese Arts Troupe has not been established for a long time. Although the work has not been done very little, the content cannot be said to be very sound. This performance is just a small sub-station in the process. We only cultivate and do not count the harvest. However, mutual comparison of the results of each performance and detailed and strict review are also necessary. I also hope that the ladies and gentlemen who watch the play will give their advice at any time?</p>
<p>A Calf Waiting to be Slaughtered</p>
<h3>Summer Night Serenade</h3>
<p>— Shulun</p>
<p>In a daze, I stroked the tail of the summer night. Isn't the night cat hiding outside the wall calling out a misty tune?</p>
<p>The window lattice filters the color of the deep night, and the night is progressing. Wind, agitator of midsummer night! Blow open the tightly furrowed eyes of the insomniac on the bed.</p>
<p>The black night protects the crawling of fleas. This makes the eyes of the sleepless so empty and helpless!</p>
<p>The deep night, can it give people a huge amount of contemplation and memories? I asked myself, will the events of distant years all return to my mind at this moment?</p>
<p>The night cat is just calling wildly, and the fleas are just filling my body. However, can the memories of the early years really search for its shadow and come?</p>
<p>I remember that I was a young singer, right? In those years, didn't I spend my time singing moving tunes?</p>
<p>However, none of these are worth people's nostalgia. What is forever engraved in people's minds is still the song of liberation that fills the streets.</p>
<p>Isn't it? On the night of victory, we who were always filled with enthusiasm for the South, didn't we rush into the lively streets for the victory report of Taierzhuang that was spread by the wind?</p>
<p>At that time, passionate young people? Patting shoulders, stepping on feet, singing loudly, passers-by opened their smiling iron faces and turned to us.</p>
<p>Now, although the night is obscured, the road of my memory, however, the current dawn is the most beautiful color!</p>
<h3>The Muddy Waves of the Haihe River</h3>
<p>— Xianghou</p>
<p>This is a letter from Englishman A in Tianjin to Englishman B in Shanghai. B is my friend, and with his permission, I am able to translate and publish a section of the letter about Tianjin. But he refused to publish his real name, so they are only referred to as A and B here.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the air is still relatively fresh, although we have felt suffocation: but in Tianjin, this ancient city, only the muddy waves of the Haihe River can freely surge. As a foreigner, it is not easy for me to obtain the same preferential treatment here as in other parts of China. Sure enough, we also have our concessions here, but the situation is ten times worse than in Shanghai. The concessions are also like the Haihe River, overflowing with muddy currents.</p>
<p>When I first arrived here, it was like a prisoner arriving at the courtroom. The interrogation was extremely strict, and after seeing the "little ghosts", I had to see the "gods"—the so-called "little ghosts" and "gods" are popular slang in Tianjin. "Gods" refer to the Japanese, and "little ghosts" are self-evident. —In the past few days, it seems that my actions have been under surveillance at all times. Later, I specially visited a Chinese friend I knew in Harbin, who has a not very unfamiliar name: "Tao Yanxin" (transliteration). He was once detained by the young general Zhang Xueliang, but now he is here as an educational administrator. I haven't seen him for many years, and this middle-aged politician has grown a Nazi-style beard. I know that his past years have been spent on "good deeds", and now he seems to have partially succeeded; but his position is always faltering as if in a dream. The "little ghosts" in the north—I'm afraid it's not just in the north—on the one hand have to be suspected by the suspicious "gods", and on the other hand have to take into account the attention of the children who grow up in this land.</p>
<p>The greatest danger for Chinese in Tianjin is the issue of thought. "Thought criminals" are almost impossible to accommodate in prisons. Because the so-called thought criminals have a very broad meaning. A Chinese accountant was arrested by the police for drawing a plum blossom under a circle. According to the painter, the circle symbolizes the moon, and Chinese people usually draw plum blossoms with the moon. However, the Japanese said that the circle symbolizes the sun, and the plum blossom is the national flower set by the Chiang government!</p>
<p>Here, the Japanese who serve as police in China use the number of their compatriots arrested as the standard for promotion. Therefore, the police in Tianjin are busy with the sole duty of arresting people all day long. Often when two policemen meet, they ask each other: "How much gold did you find today?" Gold has become a synonym for criminals! However, the police in Tianjin often become other people's "gold" when they perform their duties at night!</p>
<p>Here, there are many burning incidents, and the places where the fires start mostly belong to a certain party's property. As for the cause of the fire, even the parties involved avoid it like the plague!</p>
<p>Economic plunder can be said to be thorough here, and you can see their means of extortion here.</p>
<h3>Throwing Herself Towards the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>—Still a Story of a Girl—</p>
<p>She seemed to hear those pleading and weak words again!</p>
<p>"Qingzhi, are you just leaving home like this?"</p>
<p>"Why not? I think all young people no longer need to stay here. I have to work, otherwise I will be bored to death."</p>
<p>"I understand what you mean, but I don't believe that a weak woman like you can do much. Of course, I don't look down on you, but I think your family needs you more, and me, I need you more."</p>
<p>"Hum, if the whole nation does not exist, what is the use of the family? What is the use of the relationship between you and me? Don't try to dissuade me anymore."</p>
<p>"Of course I will remember you. Naturally, I also hope that on the day of victory, I will see you come back healthy. I know I am useless, but my heart is good for you..."</p>
<p>So her mind flashed through such a delicate face again. Under those deep eyes, hung two lines of tears; a thin and long figure, shaking as if sinking into the noisy crowd, sinking into the vast and boundless sea...</p>
<p>"Now I am really alone, without any worries, without any emotional burden. I should dedicate my life to the revival of the whole nation."</p>
<p>The night didn't know whether it was hanging down from the top of the sky or pulled up from all around. It enveloped everything. The dark clouds were blocking, there was no moon and no stars, and the boat continued to break through in the darkness, increasing the fear of the person who was sailing for the first time.</p>
<p>She seemed to have slept for a while and then turned over, and hurriedly turned on the light. Only then did she know that the dream was not real. The narrow wooden bed made her waist and legs ache, and the sound of the sea waves was even louder. It seemed that there was a storm falling from the sky, and she naturally thought of some terrible scenes; she pushed Jingwen who was sleeping below with her hand; but she didn't wake up at all, and was still sleeping sweetly. She put on her clothes alone, put on her coat, and ran to the deck.</p>
<p>The darkness that could not distinguish anything was squeezing all around, and the blurred light on the top of the mast was shaking as if it was there or not. There was no green sea water, no snow-white waves, and no wind and rain, just darkness and darkness. Suddenly, several strong lights came from afar, shooting towards this ship from different directions. Suddenly, the sea water was sparkling, and everything on the deck was illuminated very clearly. A crew member came out of the cabin and said to her:</p>
<p>"Miss, please don't stand outside. This is the searchlight of the Japanese warship. I'm afraid of causing any trouble."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll go down."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she walked back again, losing her fear, but giving rise to unparalleled anger. She knew that if China had a decent navy, the Japanese would not be able to set foot on Chinese soil first. But now on the land, in the air, we have done our best; at sea, we have to let the enemy run rampant.</p>
<p>Four days of sailing took them to a new and unfamiliar place. When they entered the port, they stopped in the sea, and there was no berthing or a small boat to pick up passengers, which made them two unfamiliar travelers. They were even more worried. When they asked others, they found out that they had to go through a quarantine procedure before they could go ashore.</p>
<p>"Then what should we do? They said they would come to pick us up." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>× Blockade of Fuzhou and Wenzhou, Hong Kong's Freight Transportation Greatly Affected, Wenzhou as an Important Port for Import to Hong Kong After the War of Resistance, Goods from Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi are Concentrated Here for Export</h3>
<p>× After falling into Shantou, they attempted to invade Fuzhou in Fujian and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, two trading ports, resulting in a sudden interruption of traffic between the two ports and Hong Kong. Since the year-long War of Resistance, Wenzhou has been one of the most important ports for the export of goods to Hong Kong from the central provinces of China, so in the future, Hong Kong's foreign trade will suffer another serious blow.</p>
<p>Freight Transportation from Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi Cut Off</p>
<p>After the fall of coastal trading ports such as Qingdao, Shanghai, and Xiamen, only Wenzhou and Fuzhou maintained freight traffic with Hong Kong. Fuzhou is 445 miles away from Hong Kong, and Wenzhou is to the north of it. Shipping companies in Hong Kong that have ships traveling on this route include Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Chee Shun. In terms of freight transportation, goods from Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi and other provinces are concentrated in these two ports for export to Hong Kong and transshipment overseas, especially Wenzhou. Each ship traveling on this line, traveling south to Hong Kong, must be fully loaded with wood oil, tea, and minerals, of which tea is the most. After the War of Resistance, these two ports accounted for an important part of the figures for Hong Kong's trade with China. Now that it is × blocked, Hong Kong's foreign trade will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Telegraph and Exchange to Hong Kong Still Open</p>
<p>Currently, telegraph transmission between Hong Kong and Fuzhou and Wenzhou is still as usual, which shows that the two ports are currently safe. As for exchange, banks also handle transactions as usual. Currently, among the coastal ports of our country that are still in our hands, only Beihai remains, and it is still sailing as usual. Recently, × has opened the port, and Taikoo's Suiyang will sail from Hong Kong for the first time today. We will observe the situation later and consider dispatching ships to travel.</p>

<h3>Auctioning Off Theater Costumes to Buy Flags, Xin Liangjiu Enthusiastically Donates, Light Military Disaster Association Hired as Chief Flag Donation Leader, Flag Donation Team Assembled at 9 am This Morning for Departure</h3>
<p>Since the Women's Military Disaster Association launched the fundraising for standard national flags, various tasks have been actively carried out. It is reported that Cantonese opera master Xin Liangjiu (Guan Dexing) heard the news of the association's flag donation and fundraising, and expressed great sympathy. He wanted to make a large donation to help the country in distress, but due to being unemployed for a long time and the environment not allowing it, he was forced to pawn a box of his valuable theater costumes, which were tools for making a living, and obtained $150 to send to the Military Disaster Association to buy a standard national flag. The association deeply admires Guan's sincere patriotism and sent a letter to hire Guan as the chief flag donation leader. Guan also felt that it was his duty and readily took on the arduous task. The association is deeply grateful for having him and expects to achieve good results. The flag donation team is scheduled to assemble at the association at 9 am this morning for departure. The team members include Ms. Xin Mu Yun, Ms. He Chu Bi, Ms. Xiao Shao Qing, Ms. Chen Man Yun, Ms. Chen Yong Fang, Ms. Gong Yu Qing, Mrs. He Qi Jian, Ms. Dong Hui Qing, Ms. Zeng You Mei, Ms. Ouyang Yu Shen, Ms. Lin Qiao Chu, Ms. Guan Yao Zhi, Mrs. Liang Qiu Fan, Ms. Liang Guo Li Chan, Dr. Ruan Zhao Yuan, Ms. Deng Yue Xian, Ms. Lu Yan Xing, Ms. Lu Xiu Lian, and Mrs. Liu Rui Ji, a total of 19 people.

Ms. He Xiang 　 also donated a national flag song to the association to express her admiration. The original text is as follows: 　 National Flag Song) "Compatriots unite to love the national flag, love the country, love the flag, love the land, unite to repay the country's kindness, those who sacrificed before will be succeeded by those who come after."</p>
<h3>Assisting in Maintaining Public Order, Continue to Recruit Auxiliary Police, Auxiliary Police Patrol the City, Petty Thieves Disappear, Hope to Enthusiastically Participate in Seeking Happiness for the Public</h3>
<p>Recently, in various districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories, bandits have been rampant and robberies have occurred frequently. In order to maintain public order in the urban areas, the police authorities, in addition to ordering their officers to strictly investigate and arrest bandits, have also dispatched auxiliary police to patrol the urban areas and assist in maintaining public order. It is estimated that since the mobilization of the auxiliary police, petty thieves have disappeared and the results have been very excellent. In order to strengthen the police force, the authorities are still continuing to recruit auxiliary police.</p>
<p>According to a certain officer of the auxiliary police, the police authorities are actively recruiting auxiliary police to assist in maintaining public order in order to maintain social peace. As of today, the number of auxiliary police has increased to 160. In the past ten years, the number of auxiliary police in Hong Kong has not exceeded 100, and there has been a considerable increase. Recruitment is still continuing, and the more people, the better. The qualifications for applying are generally (1) Fluent in English, able to speak fluent English, (2) Strong physique, (3) Noble character and able to endure hardship. After being admitted, they must enter the police academy for one year of training. The training subjects are (A) Gymnastics, (B) Learning police law, (C) Practicing shooting, (D) Using gas masks.</p>
<p>Currently, because it is in a special period, the auxiliary police have been dispatched to patrol the city for many months, every evening from 8 pm to 12 pm. The gymnastics item has been temporarily canceled. Since the auxiliary police have been patrolling, petty thieves have disappeared, and robberies have rarely occurred, which has greatly helped the regular police. The authorities are still continuing to recruit auxiliary police. It is hoped that our compatriots in Hong Kong will enthusiastically sign up to join. Because the residents of Hong Kong, especially our compatriots, are in the absolute majority, although joining the auxiliary police is to serve the Hong Kong government in their work, it is actually to protect our compatriots and seek happiness for the public. This is what our compatriots hope for.</p>

<h3>× Trying to Restore Telecommunications Traffic Between Hong Kong and Guangdong, Rumors of Agreement with Great Eastern Telegraph Company, Scheduled to Start Receiving and Sending Telegrams Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, telecommunications traffic between Hong Kong and Guangdong has been interrupted. After Guangzhou was captured by ×, business, economic and all other relations with Hong Kong have been severed. The role of telegram communication between Hong Kong and Guangdong in the past has also disappeared. Recently, (Fang is trying to restore telegrams. According to the De Chens West News, telegram communication between Guangzhou and Hong Kong has been interrupted for half a year. The Guangzhou Japanese telegram agency intends to contact the Great Eastern Telegraph Company in Hong Kong to restore telegram traffic. Both parties have reached an agreement after consultation and are now waiting for the approval of the authorities of both parties. It is preparing to start sending telegrams next month. The charging method is also planned. From Hong Kong, the charge for each Chinese character is 12 cents, and the charge for each English word is 24 cents. The cost of sending from Guangzhou is not known in detail.

<p>The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau</p>
<p>Publishes Letter to Relatives of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>National Postal Savings are Safe and Reliable</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Love Their Motherland and Are Happy to Save</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau recognizes that the number of our compatriots scattered overseas is enormous, and that they remit tens of millions annually back to their hometowns. The overseas Chinese community lacks a specific savings institution, so we are publishing a letter to the relatives of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, advising them to use the postal savings service, stating that "Our country's post offices have been providing savings services for over twenty years. Offices are located throughout the country, and savings are becoming increasingly safe and reliable. People nationwide are happy to save. Postal savings are divided into three types: passbook, children's, and fixed-term. Passbook savings require a minimum deposit of one national currency unit to open an account, with an annual interest rate of 4.5%. Children's savings require one yuan to open an account with an annual interest rate of 5%. There are also savings stamps in denominations of five cents and ten cents, which can be purchased and affixed to special grid paper provided by the post office. Once one yuan is accumulated, it can be deposited into an account to earn interest. Fixed-term savings require a minimum deposit of fifty yuan, with a term of six months at an annual interest rate of 5%, one year at 6%, and two years or more at 7%. Our overseas Chinese compatriots have a close relationship with postal savings and remittances services and trust them deeply. For example, the amount of overseas Chinese remittances paid out by post offices in Fujian and Guangdong provinces reaches tens of millions of yuan annually. Their enthusiasm for loving their motherland and trusting the post office is evident. Many use these remittances to support their families, while others accumulate them for investment. Since overseas Chinese entrust our country's post office to handle their remittances back home, they would surely be pleased to save their money in the post office as well. Therefore, after relatives of overseas Chinese receive remittances at the post office, they can open a savings account with the post office for any funds that are not immediately needed. When funds are needed in the future, they can be withdrawn from the post office at any time. When collecting remittances, simply sign the remittance slip and submit it to the post office to be credited to the account. The procedures are simple and the security is solid. Interest can be earned and the risk of theft is avoided. The post office is thinking of the relatives of overseas Chinese and offers this sincere advice."</p>
<p>Fundraising Performance for the Women's War Relief Association</p>
<p>The China Salvation Dramatic Troupe's Farewell Contribution</p>
<p>Choi Chak</p>
<p>Rehearsing Three Great Plays to be Performed at Lee Theatre This Weekend</p>
<p>Special Article by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>"Bravo! Another one!"</p>
<p>-- This is the unanimous cheer from the audience after the China Salvation Dramatic Troupe's public performance. This enthusiastic cheer is not frivolous nor is it of low taste; rather it is the sincere, tragic, and impassioned cry from the heart after receiving the cleansing of the great nation and answering the call of the rising dramatic arts.</p>
<p>Truth be told: the China Salvation Troupe has been excited, comforted, and supported by the great outpouring of compatriotic love over the past twenty-odd months of arduous and difficult life.</p>
<p>To satisfy the demands of those who missed out on the performances and the sincere invitations from various groups, "China Salvation" had already decided to perform on a large scale in Kowloon, just like at Lee Theatre. However, good things are often beset by obstacles, and no matter how they tried, they could not find a vacant theatre. Furthermore, the troupe was about to leave the country, so they could not delay their stay in Hong Kong for too long. Therefore, the wish to perform in Kowloon had to be abandoned with regret.</p>
<p>Now, the troupe's departure procedures have been completed, but the ship's departure date has not yet arrived. They still have a short time to stay in Hong Kong. Ms. Liu Qingxuan, the organizer of the China Women's War Relief Association, is enthusiastic about saving the country and is also astute and capable. Seizing this opportunity, she specially invited China Salvation to put on a farewell charity performance before leaving the country, in order to raise funds to help wounded soldiers and refugees. This also compensates for the regret of not being able to perform in Kowloon.</p>
<p>Speaking of the "China Salvation Troupe" and the China Women's War Relief Association, there is also a "marriage" worth introducing:</p>
<p>When the "China Salvation" traveled from Shaoguan to Shantou, the Fourth War Zone Command sent a escort, and that ambulance happened to be donated by the Hong Kong China Women's War Relief Association. Therefore, the troupe was already grateful to the Women's War Relief Association on their way to Hong Kong. Because of its concern for the country, the China Women's War Relief Association treated the "China Salvation," which came from the front lines, with special courtesy. After the "China Salvation" arrived in Hong Kong, they first held a grand tea party to welcome them and show their appreciation for their hard work. They also planned to cooperate in fundraising for disaster relief. However, due to the organization of a charity performance by young ladies from prominent families, they were unable to manage both, so they proposed that the United Relief Association invite "China Salvation" to perform a charity performance, which is the origin of China Salvation's previous charity performance at Lee Theatre.</p>
<p>This time, the Women's War Relief Association has set the time for China Salvation's farewell charity performance on July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd for three consecutive nights at Lee Theatre.</p>
<p>The plays to be performed are great new plays adapted by China Salvation. The first night, "By the Yongding River" is a collective creation of the National Dramatists Association after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7th ignited the flames of the War of Resistance. The original play is divided into three acts. After several performances by "China Salvation" and revisions, a prologue was added, which was changed from a famous symbolic play to "Strange Old Man," making the content more complete. The whole play is tense and passionate, and the scenery and lighting are also designed to be as good and beautiful as possible.</p>
<p>The second night will feature "The Calamity of the Earth," which consists of four independent plays. "Surviving Death" and "The Ghost's Night Cry" have already won the audience's praise in the previous "Protecting Our Motherland" performance and need no further description. As for "Pregnant Woman" and "The Roar of the Yangtze River," they should be reported to the readers.</p>
<p>"Pregnant Woman" was written by Zhang Min and adapted by Jin Shan. The plot depicts the tragic situation of pregnant women in the occupied areas. The degree of cruelty involves robbers dissecting pregnant women with sharp knives to determine whether the fetus is male or female, using it as a gambling game.</p>
<p>During performances in the war zone, some real pregnant women were deeply moved but dared not watch to the end, leaving in fear. From this, we can further understand the immense power of drama's propaganda.</p>
<p>"The Roar of the Yangtze River" is an opera written by Tian Han. The content is also very tense and lively. In the entire "Calamity of the Earth," it will surely tell the audience more touching and vivid facts.</p>
<p>The tragic passion and greatness of the third night's "Blood Splatters on Peach Blossoms" are probably already familiar to the audience and need no introduction.</p>
<p>For this performance by "China Salvation," all the scenery, lighting, props, and costumes are specially made for these plays. In addition to the several thousand yuan spent on the previous performance, more than a thousand yuan has been added (still volunteered by the troupe). Its grandeur and splendor go without saying. All three plays are directed by the troupe leader Jin Shan. Reporters saw them sweating profusely under the scorching heat yesterday rehearsing the scenery. The lighting is also being handled by the talented Lu Fu, Shen Yan, Xiao Ziying, Liu Yingfeng, and others with a fighting spirit, applying it to their entire lives. They have been working overnight lately and have almost completed it. When the performance comes, it will surely be another resounding success. It is heard that the troupe will take a ship to the Philippines after this performance and then travel to the Americas to promote their cause.</p>

<p>Rumors that Annam's Haiphong and Kwangchowan</p>
<p>Will Restrict Transit and Entry</p>
<p>Requires Guarantees from Businesses or Cash Deposits for Landing</p>
<p>However, No Reports Received Regarding Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since South China has suffered from enemy invasion, inland transportation has been severely disrupted. Those wishing to travel to Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan mostly go to Haiphong first and then return to China. Due to the war in South China, many people are unable to make a living and are seeking opportunities abroad, so the journey south is endless. The areas of Haiphong and Kwangchowan in Vietnam have suddenly become transportation hubs. Not only has the number of travelers increased sharply, but also the demand for goods from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces uses French territories as transit routes. Yesterday, it was rumored that the Vietnamese authorities had issued new regulations with strict restrictions. Anyone entering Kwangchowan after July 1, whether for transit or long-term residence, must first find a substantial and formal business to provide a guarantee before being allowed to land. If someone is only transiting and cannot obtain a guarantee from a business, they must pay a deposit of one hundred French Indochinese piastres, which will be refunded upon departure. This rule will be enforced uniformly in all French territories such as Haiphong and Kwangchowan in Vietnam. After this news spread, merchants and travelers paid close attention. The visa offices of diplomatic missions stationed in Hong Kong and the French Consulate all said that they had not received any notification and had not heard of it. Reporters also inquired among the travel agencies in Hong Kong, and all the inns had not received this notice. According to the manager of the French postal ship company, the company had not received any notification regarding this matter. It is said that "July 1st" is still several days away, and if the French government implements this new rule for foreign visitors, the company will receive formal notification in advance.</p>
<p>Mei Lin Yin He Poetry Society</p>
<p>To Hold a Large-Scale Debt Burning</p>
<p>Since the Mei Lin Yin He Poetry Society launched the debt-burning movement last year, the society has built the first furnace for burning debts. For this year's second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the poets continue to solicit poems, but the restrictions are quite strict, and poems that do not benefit history will not be recorded. A large-scale debt-burning ceremony will also be held on that day. Whether or not they are members of the society, those who wish to burn debts must send the bond number, quantity, name, address, and a brief history of the debt burner to Hong Kong Post Office Box "1176" six days in advance, so that it can be reported and announced. On that day, the poets will also skip lunch and use the money to buy bonds. A vegetarian group dinner will be held in the evening, costing one yuan per person. The surplus funds will be used to purchase public bonds. Poets from outside the society are welcome to participate.</p>
<p>Zhongda Service Corps</p>
<p>To Publish Battlefield Series</p>
<p>Since the National Sun Yat-sen University Battlefield Service Corps sent the Dongting Team back to China to serve, it has been very active in carrying out work in both the front and rear areas. It is reported that in addition to publishing the "First Year of Work" report, which reports on the work experience in the front and rear areas over the past year, the corps is now compiling and publishing the first volume of the Battlefield Series, which includes "A Record of Conscription in the Second Army Group," "One Year's Digest" (two volumes), "Speeches on Farmers and the War of Resistance," and "One Month in Dongjiang." Each issue or piece of work is systematically discussed. Part of the printing cost has been approved by the university authorities, with a subsidy of 300 national currency units. The publication date is set for July 7th, as a gift for the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction.</p>
<p>Staff of Registered Overseas Chinese Schools</p>
<p>To Hold a Symposium</p>
<p>The First Meeting to be Held This Week</p>
<p>In the past, to connect the feelings of staff at overseas Chinese schools in Hong Kong and to enhance the cause of overseas Chinese education, it was proposed to organize an association of staff from registered overseas Chinese schools in the country. All the regulations have also been drafted. However, according to recent reports, the organization has undergone some changes. It is said that the organization of the association has been unable to adapt to the actual environment, so the association has been changed to a symposium. It is scheduled to hold the first symposium at a certain hotel this week. According to the reporter's investigation, the registered overseas Chinese schools in the country include Pui Ying, Tung Fong, Tak Ming, Fang Lin, Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, Ling Dao, Chung Nam, Tao Hsiu, Mei Fang, Southwest, Hua Nan, Far East, Fudan, Si Si, Wah Ying, Zhi Xing, Holy Trinity, Min Fan, Ru Yong, Dao Qun, Zhonghua, Wah Ying Girls' School, Guangdong Affiliated Middle School, Min Da Affiliated Middle School, Xiehe, Pui Ching, Guangdong Accounting, Overseas Chinese, Yang Zhong, Zhen Guang, Pui To, Southern, Guanghua, Lingdong, Han Chi, Xiu, Culture, Lingnan Branch School, Jiujiang, Shidou, Peizhi, Hanhua, Yaozhi, Meihua, Qionghai, Lingda Affiliated Middle School, Practical Accounting, Xinghua, and Zhenzhong. There are a total of 49 schools.</p>
<p>Wang Yunyu Licensed as an Auditor</p>
<p>In Hong Kong</p>
<p>Wang Yunyu, a registered accountant of the National Government, has recently been licensed as an auditor by the Hong Kong government. According to law, he can be appointed in Hong Kong to audit the accounts of various industrial and commercial organizations, issue certificates, and handle liquidation matters. It is found that Mr. Wang graduated from Jinan University in Shanghai and later entered the graduate school of the University of the Philippines, specializing in accounting. After returning to China, he obtained the accountant's certificate from the National Government and has been practicing as an accountant in the Lixin Accounting Firm in Shanghai and Xiamen for many years, and also served as a lecturer at Jinan University and Xiamen University. According to the record, Mr. Wang is the first Chinese accountant to be licensed as an auditor by the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>Public Works Department</p>
<p>Improves Street Lights</p>
<p>Indirectly Suppressing Crime</p>
<p>Since the population of Hong Kong has increased sharply, the streets in various districts have become prosperous. The Public Works Department has planned to improve street lights to meet the needs of residents. The first step is to replace the old street lights with new ones to increase the brightness. This has been completed on the Kowloon side, and the construction is also underway on Hong Kong Island. The second step is to increase the number of street lights and improve the lighting positions. The construction project on Des Voeux Road Central to Des Voeux Road East has already started, and many new lights have been added. After the Des Voeux Road East project is completed, the same will be implemented on other roads. Recently, petty theft has been rampant in Hong Kong, and theft cases have occurred from time to time in various alleys and narrow streets. Despite strict patrols, thieves are often able to escape due to uneven lighting. It is hoped that the improved street lighting will increase the brightness in these streets and suppress crime.</p>

<p>Our Air Force Shows Its Might in Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>Fierce Bombing of Enemy Positions in Various Locations</p>
<p>Enemy Attempts to Invade Longmen from Zengcheng</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beijiang) At dawn on the 21st of this month, a squadron of our aircraft took off from a certain location. Around 6:00 AM, they arrived in the Jiangcun, Conghua, Jiekou, and Zhongluotan areas of northern Guangdong. The enemy was caught completely off guard and fled in panic to the forests outside the suburbs to hide. Our air force reconnoitered the area and then divided into two teams to drop more than 20 bombs on the enemy's camp in Xinjie, Jiangcun, destroying the enemy's forward command post on the spot. They continued to fly near Longxiang on the Guangzhou-Huaxian highway and dropped more than 30 bombs, destroying many enemy fortifications. At 6:40 AM, our aircraft completed their mission and safely flew away.</p>
<p>In the Zengcheng area, the enemy intends to contain our army and coordinate with Chaozhou and Shantou. They have been frequently deploying troops in recent days, moving from the Dapukou and Kengkour areas to Xiaolou. There are signs of an attempt to invade Longdou along the Longzeng highway. Our 12th Army Group stationed in Longmen is strictly defending Miaotan, Zhengguo, Yonghanxu, and other places. They are also advancing in Paitan and Yangcheng to control the northern section of the Zengcong highway. If the enemy advances lightly, they will be dealt a heavy blow, preventing the enemy from taking care of both ends. Currently, the front guards of our and the enemy armies are gradually approaching, and war is about to break out.</p>

<p>Strictly Prohibit People in Siyi from</p>
<p>Discounting National Currency</p>
<p>Violators Will Be Punished for Disrupting the Financial Order</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taishan] The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust of China issue national currency. The government has long stipulated that the exchange rate between national currency and provincial banknotes should be 1:44. Notifications have been issued repeatedly to strictly prohibit discounting and discrimination. It has been verified that all parts of this province have been using the 1:44 exchange rate. However, it has been found that there are still cases of discounting national currency in various places in Siyi. It is clear that there are treacherous elements manipulating and engaging in fraud, and they should be severely punished as a warning to others.

<p>Enemy Offenses in Du Ruan and Luzhou Have Failed</p>
<p>Enemy Soldiers in Zengcheng Deserters Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Enemy Invades Du Ruan</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Changsha) According to a front-line military report, at 12:00 noon on the 23rd, about 100 enemy infantry soldiers and four tanks were discovered on the Xinhu Road, launching a sudden attack on our position in Du Ruan. The security team and guerrillas defending the area immediately launched a joint counterattack and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. The enemy took advantage of the cover of the tanks and came on fiercely, but our team bravely and calmly responded. After holding out until 6:00 PM, the enemy was finally unable to withstand the attack and retreated in a panic. Our army captured two boxes of enemy military supplies in this battle.</p>
<p>Offense in Muzhou Fails</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 22nd, three enemy ships, covered by six gunboats, sent dozens of enemy soldiers to invade Muzhou, attempting to land at the Panguhuang area of Haikou, and shelled the coast. Liu's Security Team, in coordination with the local self-defense teams, calmly fought back and held out against the enemy for about two hours. The enemy was ultimately unable to break through our fire net and land, and retreated in a panic.</p>
<p>Enemy Deserters Commit Suicide</p>
<p>According to another report, on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, three enemy sentries at Huimin Gate and Gangzhou Station in Huicheng committed suicide by cutting their stomachs with bayonets in protest against the warlords' warmongering. The suicide notes addressed to their families were full of sorrow and strongly criticized the enemy warlords. It was also found that the enemy soldiers who have been harassing various lines in recent days have no desire to fight. As soon as they come into contact with our army, they retreat in a panic. On the 20th, when the enemy army was harassing Mulang, they left behind many small leaflets, which said, "Forced to come to China, not of our own volition, please be lenient with our troops."</p>
<p>Enemy in Guangzhou Cannot Sleep or Eat in Peace</p>
<p>Holds "Security Movement"</p>
<p>Young Men in the City Are Pressured and Flee</p>
<p>Shops of All Sizes Are Forced to Resume Business</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Guangzhou) The enemy army occupying Guangzhou has recently realized that our plainclothes guerrillas and special operations teams are very active in the city, and that the puppet police in the city are insufficient and their strength is empty. Therefore, many dare not stand guard at night. The enemy chief Ando has decided to strengthen "security." In addition to ordering the enemy gendarmerie to increase the number of gendarmes patrolling the streets of the city day and night to monitor the puppet police, he has also ordered the puppet municipal government to recruit 1,000 more puppet police officers to stand guard and watch closely. The puppet municipal government has decided to conscript young men from merchants in the city for training and assign them to the puppet police. Guangzhou will be divided into five major districts, and young men will be conscripted from each household by district. If no young men are handed over, each household will be required to pay a "security fee" of five yuan, otherwise they will be arrested and severely punished. The puppet municipal government issued a notice on the 15th of this month, ordering all merchants to comply by the end of the month. Currently, young men in the city are fleeing.</p>
<p>Encouraging Japanese Merchants to Set Up Shops</p>
<p>In order to attempt to prosper Guangzhou, in addition to forcing all shops of all sizes in the city to resume business, the enemy army is also encouraging Japanese merchants to set up shops, holding so-called "commercial loans," and designating Huiai Road Central, Hanmin Road, Xiqiaokou, and Changdi, the most prosperous areas in the city, as "Japanese commercial areas." The enemy dispatches one soldier to each shop in the designated areas to guard against harassment and sabotage by our special operations teams. However, because Japanese merchants are aware that high-quality goods cannot be sold and that our special operations teams and guerrillas appear frequently in the city and are difficult to guard against, many dare not do business.</p>
<p>Security Movement Is Strictly Guarded</p>
<p>The enemy army in Guangzhou is now coming up with a fantastic idea to hold its so-called "security movement." On the 18th and 19th of this month, the enemy general Ando personally summoned all enemy merchants in the city to announce that the "Imperial Army" and "Gendarmerie" have decided to eliminate "bad elements" in the city within a time limit to ensure the smooth running of business in the future. They also ordered the puppet municipal government to hold a "security movement" in conjunction with the enemy gendarmerie starting from the 20th of this month, in effect implementing a state of emergency in an attempt to reduce the sudden attacks by special operations teams and guerrillas. As a result, the city is filled with military and police, presenting an atmosphere of strict security.</p>
<p>The Xi River Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Enemy Positions in Sanshui Area Flooded</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Xi River) For ten days, the upper reaches of the Xi River have been experiencing continuous rainfall and mountain torrents, causing the river level to rise sharply in the lower reaches. Below Zhaoqing Gorge, the water flow is very rapid. Many of the lower-lying villages in Gaoyao, Gaoming, and Sanshui have been flooded. It has been verified that the enemy army on the front line in Sanshui has built many fortifications and pontoon bridges in the Hekou, Xinxu, Zhennan Lao, Yazhou, Jiaokou, Ganggen, and Makou areas in recent months. Due to the impact of the rapid currents, many have been destroyed. Moreover, the high river level threatens to flood the areas southwest of Hekou in Sanshui. Enemy Major Dongtian of Sanshui is very worried and has transported a large amount of English cement, sand, and cement from Guangzhou. On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, he forced the villagers to build river embankments.</p>

<p>Our Guerrillas Attack Lintou in Shunde</p>
<p>Our Army Attacked Lintou at Night</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Shunde) Our guerrillas are extremely active along the Nan (Hai) Shun (De) highway. On the night of the 21st of this month, more than 100 of our guerrillas attacked Lintou along the line. It has been verified that there are more than 200 enemy and puppet troops stationed in Lintou, belonging to the "Araki" unit. Our team first sent more than 40 plainclothes soldiers on the evening of the 21st, who infiltrated and ambushed near the market and the Sanjie Temple. When the enemy soldiers were fast asleep, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy from different directions. The enemy soldiers were awakened and fought back, but they were at a loss. Our team, with a spirit of sacrifice, bravely moved forward and threw hand grenades at the enemy, killing 40 or 50 enemy soldiers. After holding out for an hour, we withdrew after completing our mission. Many documents and guns were seized in this battle.</p>
<p>Enemy and Puppet Troops in Chancun Fight Each Other</p>
<p>In addition, the number of enemy troops stationed in Chancun is only half that of the puppet troops, and the enemy soldiers oppress and mistreat the puppet troops in many ways. On the 19th at noon, more than 50 puppet troops from the Northeast stole a lot of grain and property in Liubian Township near Chancun. The enemy soldiers discovered this and forced them to share the loot, but the puppet soldiers refused. As a result, a firefight broke out and they chased and attacked each other. Later, the enemy chief in Chancun came out to mediate and stop the fighting. In this battle, a total of more than 30 enemy and puppet troops were killed or injured.</p>
