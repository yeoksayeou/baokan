<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本對第三國政策的強化</h3>
<p>日本最近對外政策的動向，是在外軍人的積極蠻幹，而國內與論為其後盾，聲援。日本軍部的機關報及其系統的報紙，詳細討論過日本對第三國政策新方針，他們的結論是必須採取强硬的政策。這是日軍在華積極蠻幹的一種響應。日軍侵華行動的碰牆，已到難於再進的地步：但是他們却把這個責任轉嫁在第三國的身上。日本政府雖然時時刻刻夢想着調整各方面的外交關係，但是在外軍人却因軍事的停頓而遷怒於外邦。他們認為我國是在英美法的支持與掩護下抗日，所以第一步要驅除英美法在華的權力。這不特是經濟權益的問題，他們尤其注意到政治的問題。他們要嚴密封鎖中國海岸，竟不顧國際公約，肆意扣留並檢查第三國的輪船：他們尤其是要積極侵略第三國在中國的租界。他們已在天津及上海騷擾過好久，在鼓浪嶼登陸的事件，英美法雖然表示過强硬，但仍在僵持中。現在，租界的糾紛問題，已經不只是臨時的性質，繼軍人蠻幹之後，日本政府似乎有採取新步驟的傾向了。</p>
<p>日本資本主義的性質，常使他們的對外策略，也與其國內政治經濟的發展過程同樣，步着倒置的步伐，卽政治經濟隨着軍隊前進，在外的軍人常不顧其國內政府的方針如何，而自已採取自專的辦法，例如現在不管平沼內閣怎樣高調「親和萬邦」，外相有田怎樣對美國大使送秋波，更確切地講，不管日本目前還怎樣逼切需要着英美物質上的支持，他們却一意孤行地排斥英美法的經濟權益乃至政治權限。他們一貫地要先造成所謂「旣成事實」，然後由外交當局來折衝。</p>
<p>在軍事行動的背後，鼓動輿論的響應。在軍部刺刀監視和指揮之下，追隨軍人發表暴論的報紙，巳不只是軍部機關報，如「國民新聞」，或其系統中的「讀賣新聞」，即素來態度比較平穩的「朝日新聞」，也已提出强硬的主張了。據某方消息，「朝日新聞」竟提處理第三國在華租界的三種辦法：（一）替傀儡政府收囘各國租界；（二）修改地皮章程；（三）維持現狀而各國須與日本合作，換言之卽增加日本的地位。其結論是：第三辦法已試行失敗，第二辦法也無什麼發展，所以主張卽須採取第一種辦法。</p>
<p>他們甚至强調採用第一種辦法，因有前例，故有實現的可能性，那末，他們是準備着用武力刧奪第三國在華的租界，絕對排除第三國在華的權益了。尤其可驚奇的，素來代表產業資產階級意識的民政黨，現在竟也主張對外强硬了了。這更充分地證明日本的政治時常跟在軍事的屁股後面走，同時又反映着政治內部的矛盾性與複雜性。</p>
<p>然而我們要提醒的是：日本這種軍權先導的蠻幹，依舊帶着冒險性與試探性，這是一貫的作風，「九一八事變」的爆發，未必是當時日本政府的外交方針，所以幣原外相還强調「吞炸彈」的理論。軍事試探能成功，外交纔出頭折衝。日本軍閥又在溫習過去的許多舊夢，現在成了試探對象的英美法應該怎樣對付日本，是一個重要的問題。若能不用「裝甲的拳頭」（中野正剛之言）答複這種試探，前途的危險就不可設想了。</p>
<h3>抗戰期間的教育問題</h3>
<p>— 陳立夫</p>
<p>我們要知道一個國家由於敎育的有辦法，才能够定上民族復興的道路，而「抗戰建國」的工作猶如造一個偉大的工程，在工程未開始前，須先有精密的計劃，如工程之分期材料之配備，人工之估計，然後畫好詳細的工程圖樣，再由「總工程師」領導許多熟練的工人努力工作，以完成這個偉大的工程。今日我們建國的「總工程師」便是最高領袖，蔣委員長，一般靑年即是將來的熱練工人，三民主義就是總工程圖樣，建國大綱就是工程的分期程序圖，他分為軍政訓政憲政三個時期以完成建國的穩固基礎，建國方略就是各部分的工程細圖，他告訴我們。需要多少里的鐵路，多少里的公路，和如何開發礦產，改良農業，與辦水利發展工業等等。所以我們應該在總工程師蔣委員長領導之下，對於工程——建國——的各種條件一，尤其是整個工稈圖樣——三民主義，須作深切的探討和了解，這一點在現階段中是非常重要的。我們的三民主義，是經過率先總理四十年的革命經驗與學理研究才發明的，他是包括中國古代以來的政治哲學與歐美各派政治思想陶冶而成的。現在我們總工程圖樣的計劃者——孫總理巳經逝世了，而其繼續執行者——蔣委員長，正在堅苦的領導着全國人民——尤其是一般靑年，祖任着抗戰建國的神聖任務。</p>
<p>說列這裏，一般靑年的責任是如何的重大啊！要使一般靑年克盡其責，我們就不能不談到敎育。先賢吿訴我們「管」「敎」「養」「衛」四字之重要，因為世界萬事，要想達到成功的目的，都不能脫離這四個宇。我們要救中國，要復興民族，亦全靠這四個宇做基礎，換句話說，這四個字便是完成建國大業必須具備的根本條件。現在分別解釋其含義：</p>
<p>敎育的第一個目的，就是「自治治事」，卽在使被敎育者能够，一，自治，二，治人，三，治事。然而社會本是複雜的，是易於為惡的，人們的周圍蘊藏着極大的引力。物理上所謂「兩物相處引力生焉」，其公為式　孟子也說「物與物則引之而已矣」。人生在宇宙間，自然免不了受外力的吸引。佛家謂耳目口鼻身意為六欲，最易與外界力量發生因緣。慾望愈奢的人，感受外力的作用亦愈大，一被外力引誘，便失去了自治能力，而為外力所支配，於是貪汚，詐偽，舞弊，百病叢生，不一而足。故今日之敎育，首在培養靑年有「自治」「治人」「治事」的能力去支配外力，而不為外力所支配，去轉移環境，而不為環境所轉移，務必做到「富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈」。大家都知道顏囘是孔子的得意門生，顏囘死了，孔子悲痛異常，為什麼呢？就是顏囘能够把握住自己，對己力從簡約，不為物誘，對人努力服務，毫不厭倦，「一簞食，一瓢飲，在陋巷，人不堪其憂，囘也不改其樂」，這是顏回人格高尙的證明，也就是孔子愛重他的所在。孟子也說：「學問之道無他，求其放心而巳矣」，一個人對於方寸能够操縱自如。才談得上自治，能自治，才能够去管理人家，得到人家的敬佩。否則自己貪汚，而叫人不食汚，自己不和士卒同甘苦，而叫人吃苦，那是絕對辦不到的。古人不是說邊了嗎？「其身正，不令而行，其身不正，雖令不從」。武漢的退却，我們最高的領袖以身作則，直到大家撤退以後，才離開漢口，這是多麼偉大人格的表現。現在學校要嚴格管理的原因，就在棄這種純潔的環境，訓練出將來領導社會的中堅分于——靑年。因為學生在學校裏萬一身心修養的工夫不够，很容易陷於惡劣的環境中，同流合汚，無所底止。所以靑年學生在校，便應確定革命的人生觀，立德修身，以樹立將來處世行事之基，人必先自治而後始能治人，能治人始能治事，大學中所謂本末終始之道，端在乎此。</p>
<p>敎育的第二個目的，就是「自養養人」，如果受過敎育而不能生活，那就是低能兒；如果自己能力够賺五十元，知要用一百元，則牧支永遠不能相抵，陷自己於毀滅，於國家為罪人。所以靑年學生出校以後，工作務求其努力，消費務求其儉約。凡做一樁事，一定要從低從小做起，例如我原是學礦業的，畢業後卽會經做過汚穢的礦工，現在假使我在辦理曠務，有人對於礦工方面有所欺瞞，我决可以發覺他，因為我是由低級的艱苦階段完全經過的緣故。同樣我們到軍隊裏去，亦須從班長排長做起，如此才能看到下層的實况。一個人能够勝於別人者在於經騐之豐富，學識之廣博，德打之高超，所以一般靑年畢生這寳貴的時期——二十歲至三十歲中應是學行的準備時期，在這個時期能够樹立緊固的基礎，將來才能成一個有用的人才。現在有一部份靑年，往往忽於高深學問與國際經濟的探討，只知互相間的排斥和地位高低的攘奪，是祗見目前，而不見遠大光明的將來，眞是亡國的現象。我們要知道現在的靑年都是異日建國的中堅，在學識經驗上必須要由低而高慢慢的培養，如同「金字塔」似的，其間雖為時甚久，而收效實甚大。在操守上更要竭力降低私生活。如果在機關要服務，能够廉隅自礪，兩袖淸風，那末「合則留，不合則去」，毫無戀棧之心，執行我的任務，裁判他人的是非，而不致為人所牽制，所要挾。所以在學校裏必須竭力儉約，將來才可以不走入食污的惡徑，完成前途偉大的事業，孔子說過：「君子憂道不憂貧」，又說：「士志於道，而恥惡衣惡食者，未足與議也」這實在是一個人持身涉世應採的態度。我們領袖家裏吃飯，三素一輩，有些時候甚至，飯也忙不過來，你看這是何等的儉約，何等的辛勞。周公貴為王弼，猶「一沐三握髮，一飯三吐哺」，甚至「思兼三王，以施四事，其有不合者，仰而思之，夜以繼日，坐以待旦」，勤勞國事，一至如此，所以才能奠定成周八百年的基礎。現在衆人之事——政治的部門日繁，單靠我們的領袖一個人的努力是不够的，還要全體熟鍊工人——一般靑年的努力才行。所以現代靑年一面要有自養的能力，同時還要作養人的打算。總理說：凡聰明才力愈大的人，常盡其能力而服千萬人之務，造千萬人之福；聰明才力略小的人，當盡其能力而服十百人之務，造十百之福；至於全無聰明才力的人，也應盡一巳的能力而服一人之務，造一人之福，卽是這個意思。</p>
<h3>當前青年的出路問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 馮文彬講　西安特約航信</p>
<p>敎育的等三個目的，是「自衝衛團」，我們為要祖當抗戰勝利後更難艱的工作，先須有健全的體魂，鍊成一個能經霜露，耐風雪的精神。這不僅是健强個人尤其重要的是謀民族的健康，所以一般靑年在學校裏必須注重一般體操和軍訓，因為軍訓的目的卽在培養民族健全的精神。現在一般青千年平均每人中體格及格的成份很少，再想到大多孱弱民衆，中國如何不危險呢？所以我主張體格鍛鍊要有一定的標準，卽所謂「格」。我國以前一般人民的體格本是很魁格的，後來因有白面書生為士人美的觀念，漸使民族陷于文弱的境地。我們以後應該把美的觀念改為「身體充實者謂之美」，提倡激蕩，使成風氣，人人以強壯為當然，以孱弱為可恥，普遍推行軍事訓練，並提倡衛生運動。這樣除了健强個人的體格，幷可以增進全民族的健康。人人能自衛，人人能衛國，民族强盛，國家地位也自然增高了。</p>
<p>最後說到敎育的本身的目的就是「自信信道」。所謂自信者，卽是使被敎育者人人有立志，以完成自己的責任與使命；屆時對國家要樹立共同信仰，本此信仰，共同致力，以促進國家的建設，是卽所謂信道，換言之，亦卽信仰主義是也。古人說：「夫道若大路然」；又說；「義人之正路也」，可冤背之所謂進，卽今之所謂主義。三民主編尙是我們民族求生存的主要路線，也可說是我們今日共由的大道，而敎育者的責任，就是使如何了解三民主義，更進而求其實行，所以中庸上說：「修道之謂敎」。</p>
<p>以上所議的意義整合起來，就是一，教——自信信道，二，管——自治治事，三，養——自養養人，四，衛——自衛衛國。靑年人人而能具備這四個要件，才是標準的靑年，集如此之靑年而成國家，則國家自無不具備管敎養衛的四大條件了。如祇具備四條件之一半，卽僅能自信、自治、自養，自衛，而不能信道，治事，養人，衛國，那只完成了立巳功夫，剛剛及格，與社會無所褲益，生固不足貴，死亦不足惜。剛果根本不能具備任何一個條件，那是無人格，為國家社會打算，這種靑年還是生不如死了。我們希望的標準靑年是人人具備上述十六個字，為一健全人格之國民。</p>
<p>所以我我現在希望一般靑年能够把握住這千載難逢的時機，來培養「自信信道」「自治治事」「自養養人」「自銜衛國」的能力，以完成革命者健全的人格，未來建國的責任，實巳負荷在我們的肩上！</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我們的努力需要有一定方針。</p>
<p>二切方針中最基本的，就是全體靑年的團結統二，只有建立强大的抗日救國靑年統一戰綫，我們才有希望勝利。</p>
<p>擺在我們全中國靑年前面的一個嚴重問題，就是解放與滅亡的問題，我們如果團結起來就能解放，分裂就會滅亡。</p>
<p>因為目前正是我們具有四五千年歷史的偉大民族生死存亡的緊急關頭，×人巳經深入我們的腹心，佔據了我們幾乎所有的名都大邑和交通要道。只要我們一放鬆，祖先遺留給我們的廣大土地，就要被×人完全佔領，首先遺留給我們的悠久文化就要被×人完全摧毀，而我們們的子子孫孫就要、永遠做×人的奴隸，</p>
<p>人人受着同樣的威脅，人人都要在勝利滅亡的道路中間擇一條。</p>
<p>要是我們一盤散沙似的各自爲戰，甚至一面抗戰，一面還要自相水火，自相磨擦，我們就必然被×人各個擊破。因此必需團結。從前就需要團結，戰爭危急的時候更需要團結，人人需要團結，年力強壯為國家命脈的靑年更需要團結。團結則生，分裂則亡。</p>
<p>只有不分階級，不分黨派，不分信仰，不分種族，一切中國的靑年男女，只要是不甘心亡國滅種的，只要是願意過人的生活，過自由快樂的日子的，都一致親密合作起來，團結起來，這才是我們靑年的唯一出路。</p>
<p>自從一九三五年的中國×××八一宣言和北平學生一二九運動以來，團結抗戰為民族的獨立，為民主自由，為民生幸福，已經成為全國廣大八靑年的共同要求。在十九個月以前，西北靑年救國會第一次代表大會對於全國靑年團結更做了具體的提議：</p>
<p>「一，不分黨派，不分階級，不分信仰，不分性別，在抗日救國的目標之下，全國靑年大聯合。</p>
<p>二，放棄派別成見，放棄互相攻擊，全國各地的靑年組織互相合作，產生全國及各地的統一的靑年組織。</p>
<p>三，在民主原則下意見取决於大多數，領導機關由大多數人選舉產生。</p>
<p>四，由各處靑年互相推選代表，召開全國靑年救國代表大會，决定抗日救國的共同綱領。</p>
<p>五，爭靑年生活上，經濟上，政治上的一切改着。」</p>
<p>這個提議正代表了全國靑年的普遍要求。隨舊抗戰的爆發和進展，全國上下對於靑年必需團結的認識也更加確定。蔣委員長在廿七年六月十六日吿全國青年書中說得好：</p>
<p>「欲期抗戰必勝，建國必成，必須培植國家民族之深厚力量，以為其基礎，而此所謂國家民旅之深厚力量者，即全國靑年之覺醒與團結是也」。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我們必需團結，而且我們也能够團結。</p>
<p>我們能够團結，首先是因為我們有共同的利害。我們有共同的×人日本帝國主義，有共同的事業抗戰建國。他們對於各階層各黨派的靑年是共同的，對於各地區各種族的靑年也是共同的。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的侵略巳經打破了我們舊有的界限</p>
<p>北平的學生會經有舊學聯和新學聯的糾紛，甚至發生過流血事件，×人來了，不但强迫他們同受漢好的奴隸敎育，而且在太原失守時，還强迫他們去參加「慶祝」的遊行，此時留在北平的新舊學聯大家躱在一間屋子裏相對而哭泣了，過去的成見已再不存在了</p>
<p>×人擁殘了孫中山先生在上海的銅像和在南京的陵寢，同樣也汚辱了佛敎和喇嘛敎的廟宇，×人陰謀用對德王的手段，來欺騙囘民建立所謂囘囘國，但是同時又用飛機轟炸囘民，强迫囘敎的靑年同胞吃大葷。</p>
<p>中華　　　　　　　　　　　　，各階層各黨派各地區各種族的靑年，他們的熱血灑遍了民族自衛這疆場。他們血流在一起，融和在一起，離也分不出的是那一黨派，那一地區，那一種族的血了，這就是中國靑年能够團結的鐵證。（紋掌）</p>
<p>在我們會塲上的代表有國民黨的靑年，共產黨的靑年，無黨無派的靑年，我們的代表論性別有男有女，論社會成分有工有農有兵有學有商，論種族有漢有囘有蒙。我們的代表有從西北各省和陝甘寧邊區來的，有從緩遠，晉西北，晉西，晉西南，晉東南晋察冀，冀中，冀魯豫，魯東南，河南，兩湖，四川，雲南，雨廣，福建，江西，浙江，江蘇等戰區×後方和我後方來的，還有從朝鮮和南洋各地來的，我們大家一心一志的，為了靑年的團結統一，為了要來研究中國青年運動的經驗和前途，大家都不遠幾千里而來，相親相愛的，好像一個母親所生的骨肉同胞。這也就是中國靑年能够團結的鐵證。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>並且我們的團結還有許多有利的條件。</p>
<p>第一，我們有抗日民族統一戰綫做我們的基礎。抗日民挨統一戰綫的骨幹是什値慶？就是中國國民黨和中國×××。國民黨是今日掌握政權的黨，它的領袖蔣委員長廿七年四月對巴黎晚報特派員談話中曾明白指出：「國民政府在孫總理各項原則不受破壞之條件下，願與各黨携手合作，以對付共同的×人。」×××是××××的×××，大家都知道，是抗日民族統一綫戰最早和最××的倡道者，最××××的支持奢和准進者。×××向全中國人民指出抗日民埃統一戰綫的奮鬥總方計，並且用全力來實現它，同樣它也對全中國靑年指出靑年統一戰綫的奮鬥總方針，並且在各方面幫助它的實現。沒有國民黨，沒有×××，沒有民族統一戰綫的靑年：</p>
<p>第二，我們靑年不僅有團結抗戰的堅定决心，而且有實現民主和改善民生的共同要求，我們個個靑年都渴望實現民主自由的政治，在這一點上，各黨派各階層的青年不但可以獲得團結的根據，而且也可以獲得團結的保陣。所謂民主自由，首先應該保障思想信仰言論出版集會結社的自由。三民主義不値是民族解放的主義，而且是民主由自和民生改善的主義，正是因爲如此，三民主義得到廣大靑年的擁護，而成為靑年團結的重要武器。</p>
<p>有人以為我們旣然有了三民主義，就不應再容許其他的思想信仰同時存在了。這是把三民主義看錯了，曲解了，並且把三民主義的優點抽掉了。三民主義的主要優點之一，正在於它堅持思想信仰的自由。</p>
<p>孫中山先生關於三民主義解釋說：「民族主義是對外打不平的，民權主義是對內打不平的。……對國內的專制打不平，便要應用民權主義，提倡人民的權利；提倡人民的權利，便是公天下的道理。」</p>
<p>早在民國二十年一月一日的國民黨宣言裏，就明明白白的「確定人民有集會結社言論出版居住信仰之絕對自由權。」根據三民主義而規定的抗戰建國綱領也在二十六條規定說：「在抗戰期間，於不違反三民主義最高原則及法令範圍內，對於言論出版集會給社，當與以合法之充分保障。」為了實行一條，中央政府對各地方當局會經特別的三令五申，以昭鄭重。</p>
<p>我們不能用三民主義來反對民權主義，用抗戰建國綱領來反對抗戰建國綱領第二十六條呢？顯然是不能的。</p>
<p>又有人以為三民主義雖然包含民權主義民生主義，但是現在却不能去提倡他們，提倡他們要在民族主義成功以後。　（未完）</p>

<h3>視察江南游擊區歸來　周恩來談新形勢（下）　組織×後民衆展開全民戰鬥　化×後為前方擊破經濟陰謀</h3>
<p>經濟侵略　又據周氏言一日方肅清後方之計劃、計有五點、（一）對我作經濟上之封鎖、（二）對我進行經濟戰、（三）略取我煤、鐵、棉、鹽、茶、米等等產物、以圖充實日本之資源、更將此等原料轉成日貨對華傾銷、（四）開發華北之交通線、（五）建築港口、在戰事之初、日本原圖封鎖我國、截至今日則已欲與我從事交易矣、在戰事發動之初、本原圖摧毀我國所有之工業、惟至今日、則彼等又圖在我被佔區重建工業矣、良以一味鼓勵輸出、在日本之國際支付上、頗形不利也、至於日本獲取佔領區原料計劃、亦甚少成功、例如、日人企圖於華北獲取煤一千萬噸、但結果僅被收括一百萬噸、再如經濟開發之問題、根本不可能、因此點必須在軍事上能控制日軍之後方而後可、故在初時、必須法幣一元四角、始能換取偽幣一元、但至目前、則此項匯率、已却相反再、如彼等建築港灣之計劃、早已擬定、但至今尙未動手、</p>
<p>我方對策　周氏繼談我處應付日×此項計劃之綱領稱、「我人承認有甚多之弱點、如對於日本不能作為底之經濟封鎖、不能對日貨作激底之抵制、在淪陷之前、不能對各項工廠澈底之破壞、致洛日人之手、同時、日貨亦仍能流入我國、」周氏繼謂、「我人必須對沿海一帶作澈底之封鎖卽使該處之民衆感受不便、亦所不顧、我人之目的、在使中國民衆自給自足、故我人對於淪陷區域之破壞工作、必繼續進行、尤其對於鐵路公路及日人利用之各項工業、施以破壞</p>
<p>全民戰爭　我人巳將多數民衆組織起來、從事於破壞日軍交通綫及保持日軍後方中國資源之工作、同時更使偏僻區域中之民衆、了解此次對日抗戰之意義日軍目前在華所以能獲多少成就之故、大抵出於我自已方面之弱點、而非全由日軍之力量、例如我人有種部隊、未習於游擊戰術、以故未能充分達成打擊日人之使命、同時民衆之合作、亦未能充分圓滿、故許多地方之淪、與其謂爲由於日軍之征服、無寗謂為由於我人之自動放棄、至於月今羣衆多巳組織起來、彼等皆巳熱烈於從事打破日人利用我國人力瓷源征服中國之計劃、故目前日軍後方之抗日戰爭、乃為有組織民衆對於日人之全面戰爭、非僅為游擊隊之抗戰工作、同時在正面方面、我人于×人向某方推準時、亦不絕對×人多方面之反攻、再則我人在後方、亦不絕訓練新軍、以備最後之一擊、以取得最後之勝利、」</p>
<p>論新階段　周氏又謂「在此抗戰之新階段中、日軍雖尙能獲取小勝、但絕無獲取大勝之可能性、日人此後將向何方進攻、此點難以預言、但所可知者、必向可以獲取最後大利益之處進攻、卽所謂攻我人之弱點及不預備之處也、如最近之南昌攻戰、卽為一例、此外、關於我方之鐵路以及其他交通綫、亦在其進攻之目的中、大約此日人人、進攻方向、將視歐局變化為轉移、假若英法有事於默洲、則日人將續向西南推進、反之、將向北推進、總之、其目的在排除在華之外人利益、</p>
<h3>滬西賭窟土行　擴張至租界　愚園路一家有政治作用　俱在×方庇護之下</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】極司非爾區「歹土」中日方保護下之賭窟、近數週內、開始擴張入公共租界、新設之賭窟、計有三所、其二在海格路、其一卽戈登路六十五號之亞細亞俱樂部、海格路三六八號附近之賭窟、係開設「好萊塢樂園」之華人所經營、另一所在海格路億定盤路轉角、殆係獨立性質、此外極司非面路、康腦脫路、白利南路、福開森路與極可非而村中亦有賭窟約二十所、完全在公共租界內之戈登路之新賭窟、聞獲利最厚、有達一夕四萬金之多者、此等賭窟、均屬華人經營、彼等與日軍特務部有密切聯絡、而得其保護、戈登路與海通路二賭窟為好萊塢樂園股東、粵人王某經濟、海格路億定盤路轉角之賭窟、係李某所設、經埋劉某、聞係轉人或臺人、保證保護此等賭窟之日軍特務部、設辦事處於極司非而路凱納路轉再附近、主持日人名節野、戈登路睹窟中、有司出納之日人一名、其獲利之半數、須交付日方、其他賭窟向日軍特務部繳保護費、則未可知、日方不僅保證經營賭窟之華人、不遵公共租界警務人員干涉、聞且保證賭徒於宵禁後返寓、不遭拘捕、或干涉、自日軍侵佔上海區後、隨以具來之罪惡、非僅賭窟一端而已、字栓報會刊有土行三十四所之名稱、均設於公共租界與法租界轄區以外、聞此等土行、均向日軍特務部領有執照、每月繳費六百元、上週內復有土行四所開設、極司非而區中此等罪惡之發展、及其蔓延入公共租界、對於租界中當然有不良之影響、</p>
<p>【又訊】滬西越界築路區域最近新設賭窟多家、貽害人民、甚於洪水猛獸、愚園路八百六十四號房屋、醞釀組織大規模之賭窘一所、為時甚久、因未獲得某方之諒解、曾一度暫停籌備、近日始由某方人員出面主持、宣告實現、參加組織者、份子極為複雜、其內容實有政治性質、但其賭博部份、禍害社會、正復興其他賭窟相同、租界當局、現正法視其如何發展、以憑採取適當處置、予以嚴歷取締、</p>
<h3>×軍強佔下　綏東情勢惡劣　商業金融悉為×方操縱　×方宣傳純係空中樓閣　滬鏅報記者視察報告</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】字林西報張家口通訊云、二月間、外國記者一隊、在日本官方領導下、游歷綏遠之歸化、據蒐集報端消息所得、若輩此行返後、熱烈記述內蒙旅行之愉快情况、幾類第二天堂、該地和平而廣博、貿易緊榮、地方工業發達、人民極歡愉而滿足云云、記者周知該地情况與此間張家口相仿、此等樂觀之消息、頗令記者驚訝、故不久前、懷好奇心而赴歸化及其他城鎮一行、勾留數週、甚為失望而返、殊不解此種樂觀消息何所據也、據記者觀察所得、</p>
<p>內蒙情况　、匪特未可樂觀、實較日軍侵入前狀况為惡劣、往昔歸化繁榮所繫之興盛的輸出商業、今已全歸停頓、推究其故、一因自甘禍及新疆西南部起之商隊大道、完全阻斷、華軍陣綫、僅在平綏路終站包頭迤西不數哩處、曩時駱駝列成長行、循該古代之商隊道路、緩然而行、每小時輒為二哩半、用以載運皮革羊毛、及綏西之其他產物、獲利甚豐之載運雅片商隊、且置勿談、凡此種種、均巳停止、今無商隊行抵包頭或歸化、其次、北部蒙古平原中、</p>
<p>盜賊橫行　如故、故常赴蒙占收買產物之中國商人巳不復冒險前往此等區域、實際上、人民殖居之各區、巳慘遭蹂躪、許多鄉村、荒無人烟、人民貧困苦痛萬狀、許多已經墾殖之土地、今復變成牧場、就他方面而言、蒙人自身、亦不復携其貨物往鐵路上各城鎭求售、蓋恐被迫照官定之低徵價格而出售也、僅剩之輸出商業、均須經蒙藏公司之手、該公司名義上為蒙人六商號所合組、實際上全在</p>

<p>政治局勢　似不較商業與金融局勢爲可愉快、蒙人與日人、彼此均頗不信任、蒙古政府雖號稱自治、實際上當然由日方顧問支配、最近且由日軍代表所操縱、蒙古親王固深知處於附庸地位、且甚感不决、但渠對此、無能為力、募以對抗華軍、鎭壓盜匪之蒙軍數千人、卽所謂「內蒙軍」者、誠惡劣巳極、紀律蕩然、遑論作戰、日人本身、對彼等亦不信任、此等蒙軍、每被派出鎭壓盜匪、輒洗刦鄉村、作最可怖之暴行、故人民恨之刺骨、較日軍尤甚、因蒙軍之無用、華正規軍常向綏遠各城襲擊、直迫墟垣、而全無損失、時而華軍待×行近、蒙軍見事態嚴重、輙竄逃他處、因日人與蒙人雙方俱不滿意、故記者在歸化時、雙方頗為緊張、遍城謠諑紛起、有謂「蒙軍政府」行將他遷、名義上之主腦德王業已被黜者、有謂「自治政府」完全廢除、該地歸日軍直接統治者、此等謠諑、將否成為事實、留待異日覘之、但不久恐難免有若干變動也、就內蒙平民福利言、目下之政權、對其所治區域、當然未有改進、事實上、如本文初段所述、該地情况較一九三七年初</p>
<p>大見惡化　、約言之、其故有三、（一）一般的財政興經濟事務、處理失當、（二一）佔人口什九之華人、對日方侵佔、其仇視之深、一如往昔、（三）日人未能博得蒙人之友好與合作</p>

<h3>世界的命運　與遠東前途</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>現在我們要述一述英、蘇、這兩個多月來合作談判的具體進展、大體上、它是可以分成三個階段、捷克亡了後、英、法當局立刻和蘇聯開始接洽、表示願意共同抵抗更進一步的侵略、蘇聯的答覆、却是比較不着邊際的所謂「集體安全」的再建、這是第一步、老實說、蘇聯那時、是懷疑英、法、的誠意的、於是、羅馬尼亞和波蘭、受威脅了、為了表示誠意、英國首先祖保波、羅兩國的獨立、英、法再轉向蘇聯尋取在歐洲合作時、這一次、蘇聯才提出了進一步的具體意見、那是、這一合作、應當包括遠東在內、這是第二階段、當這時、羅斯福總統出了面、同時，美國海軍調囘了太平洋、是於英國把日本從侵略集團裏拆出來的幻想、又抬了頭、英國駐日大使、異常活躍了、對蘇聯的談判、一時即反而入了停止的狀態、可是不久、希特勒的演說裏、廢止了德·波互不停犯條約、以及英·德海軍協定、因而歐洲的局面、又呈現了緊張、由着英、蘇間的談判、就踏進了第三個階段、這一次、英國的着眼點、巳經不是什麼合作、而祗是詢問着、（一）英·法如果爲了履行對羅·波等國的擔保、其捲進戰爭時、蘇聯會不會帮助呢、（二）蘇聯可不可以對羅、波等國來一樣同樣的担保、蘇聯的答案、却是、（一）蘇、英、法、波間、應當有一個比較肯定的互助協定、（一）保證的範園、應當亦東歐普及於自最北各國、一直到巴爾幹、在西方連比利時、荷蘭、瑞士等國、也都包括在內、</p>
<p>（未完待續）</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>救濟失學難童</h3>
<p>粵省振會在港澳各地設立中華綫，學救濟夫學難童，自本月廿二日起分在各區招生報名，截至廿七日止，報名者已達三千人，超過該會預定名額竟達三分之二，可見將來救濟難童問題。必仍嚴重。這是一般關心於社會與公益事業的人士所不能忽視的。我們希望各界領袖。至少要努力實現以下幾點：</p>
<p>卽第一，應該舉行更大規模的招生報名，使港澳各地失學難童都來報名，切實登記起來。第二，可以同時擴大舉行失業敎師的登記。並迅速籌商救济，組織與訓練此種敎師的辦法。第三。同時推展救濟失學動童的宣傳、和統一的廣泛的募捐運動。</p>
<p>為了實現上述步驟，一面應該取得祖國關係當局的指導與扶助，一面還要爭取港澳當地有力份子的同情興協助。此外救濟失學難童，不能僅以使有享受敎育機會卽為滿足，我們還要關心到難童的實際生活情况，和所受敎育糾織與訓練之是否適應××建國的需要。而爲增進××建國敎育效率與迅速掃除文盲起見，我們一面還應攷慮運用拉丁化新文字的新敎育工具，還應極力推行小先生制度和實現生活敎育，我們要使這些難童能够在砲火威脅下努力工習，作為將來支持××與展開建國工作的生力軍。</p>

<h3>「中救」昨天賣座之一幕　「賊」！</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>「賊」…針對着香港社會</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團，昨天公演三場都吿滿座。記者所要特別介紹的是「保衛祖國」的第一幕「賊」。因為「賊」的華麗佈景及妙趣情節特別適合香港一般觀衆的胃口</p>
<p>「賊」的意識是針對××社會的上層階級。</p>
<p>幕開，掌聲起，因為貴埃化的家庭，深遠的立體建築，閃爍的繁星，再送來陣陣的禮拜堂的鏡聲，很多人把它當作「美」的頂點遂喝采起來。其實，來自火線與農村，街頭的「中救」的眞而目何嘗如此，這，只本過是襯托劇情的工具箱了。</p>
<p>劇的主旨是表現一個富有家庭直到被偷之後，才受「賊」的感化而醒覺皮之不存，毛將焉附，有國才有家的道理。</p>
<p>王瑩飾大少婦，金山飾大少爺，糜爛的生活，是都市荒淫階級的寫照。國家的事，管他媽的。這二個反派的角色使人非常惱恨！與下台後的金山王瑩是迴然不同的二種人。他們二人的思想要不是武裝起來，舞台上的荒淫生活可能就是這二個「明星」的日常生活。從兩種人及兩種不同的精湛演技掀起記者洶湧的思潮。</p>
<p>大少爺的弟妹——范政，秦小竹飾——爲了献金救國而來倫家裏的銀舖，可知道同一環境，亦可能生長了兩種不同的人物。</p>
<p>又另一個賊——蘇繪飾——是×人們的當他說明哀曲之後，少爺的父母親使他破產：是生活迫他做「樑上君子」——子英，柯剛飾，十分配稱——都被感動了，同情他，原諒他，遂給他吃一碗燕窩，「賊」一以以燕窩救不了多日挨餓的肚子，要求給他殘羹冷飯，大少爺竟謂，「燕窩有維他命A啊！」</p>
<p>「等到××來了！什麽亦沒有了！」</p>
<p>「國家不强盛，個人還有好日子過活嗎？」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>這三個賊這樣說服了全家人——至死不悟的少奶奶除外——在掌聲雷動之下，父母親還將家中的物品，與剛才偷不去的銀器，一齊給那「三個賊」帶去献金救國，並且親自送至門外。——香港的上層階級，能有這般事實嗎？</p>
<p>醒醒吧！少奶奶們！</p>
<p>雀戰歸來的大少奶（王瑩飾）</p>

<h3>男女伶人的壽命　女伶比男伶來得命短</h3>
<p>記得費爾白在「二十世紀劇場」裏、有一張伶人壽命統計表、是這樣的、</p>
<p>著名男伶的平均壽命——六十六歲餘</p>
<p>著名女伶的平均壽命——六十一歲餘</p>
<p>平常男伶的平均壽命——四十五歲</p>
<p>平常女伶的平均壽命——三十七歲餘</p>
<p>男伶的平均壽命為———五十五歲</p>
<p>女伶的平均壽命為——四十九歲</p>
<p>照上表上看來、女伶總比男伶來得命短、這大槪是因為女人身體柔弱居多的緣故吧、至於着名伶人、比平常伶人來得壽長、當然是綫多心寬、無愁無憂的緣故、反之吃了早飯沒有晚飯、在貧苦生活中煎熬的平常伶人他們的生命又怎麼會長呢、</p>
<p>再說中國伶人吧、從前那些老古董伶人的壽命、倒也常常五六十、七八十歲的、現在呢、壽長的反而少了、女色中混混、黑飯吃吃、實在兩大致命傷、</p>
<h3>歌王美眷觀後</h3>
<p>— 白華　Sweetbearts　米高美出品</p>
<p>我覺得「比翼雙飛」的劇作者是相當天可愛的、眞他告訴我們這機一個故事、「百老匯有一位劇作家為着一種特殊的關係、拆開了一對比翼的愛侶、他的計劇是想使一個妻子相信她的丈夫和她們的女書記發生了戀愛、他派人把丈夫寫給妻子的情書偷了出來、把它放進劇詞里、讓妻子相信丈夫也有一封同樣的信寫給了那位女書記、」所謂「一種特殊的關係」、就是和這對夫婦的監製人發生利害爾突是也、不過劇作者也顯示了他的聰明、這對夫婦是百老匯的舞臺名伶、因為好萊塢電影公司的聘請、才想出這計劃來使他們不能到好萊塢去、可是就為了劇了者的聰明、又吿訴了我們好萊塢和百老匯之間有着爭聘名角的暗鬭、</p>
<p>「比翼雙飛」是珍妮麥唐納和奈爾遜埃第的第一部五彩片、因為是五彩片、導演者范達克氏在服裝、襯景、道具上、都盡了裝皇富麗、淸幽和諧的能事、如一開場的三幕歌劇、第一場荷蘭農歌的樸素優美、第二場「劇的命運」的鮮艷奪目、第三場「比翼雙飛」的和諧美麗、不但此也、卽是每一塲、導演在色素的配台上、都是非常謹愼從事的、珍妮麥唐納在化妝室中穿了鮮艷的襯衣、對鏡子下裝的時候、那色彩不但更襯出麥唐納的美麗、看着的時候也覺得非常舒服、還有麥唐納的時裝表演、這果然介紹了好萊塢流行的新裝束、但何嘗不是顯示彩色片的功能呢、</p>
<p>你看過「絕代斃后」嗎你被范達克卓越的手腕所感動嗎、（那是寫曼安東娓的一生、不是寫法國革命史）但「比翼雙飛一是一個喜劇、他是一反那種深刻動人的細膩描寫、全片始終在輕快的旋律中發展、一直到終場我特別愛好的是在麥唐納聽了劇作家的新劇本的那場戲、他們夫婦在整裝待發的時在、由於這位劇作家的出現而破壞了、這場戲利用音樂來襯托麥唐納的心理狀態、是非常可愛的特別是織接、</p>
<p>你不是喜歡「柔腸九週」中的羅倫揚嗎、那末這里飾演監製人斐立斯李門的佛蘭摩根也同樣可愛、</p>

<h3>狄安娜　萍改變了　居然像一個大人樣子</h3>
<p>狄安娜竇萍、這是一位可愛的女孩子、漸漸地長大了、她現在穿起了高跟鞋、長衣服、戴着成人樣的帽子、她今年是十六歲、「不久將十七歲了」、她會這樣吿訴你的、</p>
<p>在拍「三朶花」的某一個鏡頭裏、地板上非常光滑、牆上掛了一面極大的鏡子、狄安娜穿了一身淡發和銀色的夜禮服、（這是她第一次穿得這模樣上鏡頭的）、當她落落大方地走出來的時候、立刻就看見在鏡子裏的自己、穿的衣服是多麽引人注目、多麽美艷、她很莊嚴地向前進、同時注意着地板上的反射和鏡子裏影兒、太美麗了、的確她是大得多了、</p>
<p>狄安娜不再多吃冰淇淋和糖果一類的東西了、吃飯也有秩序了、她從不喝咖啡、但是牛奶她仍是歡喜的、她不再咀嚼橡皮糖了、現在她對於看書很有興味、在過去一年中、她已看過了六七本名著小說、</p>
<p>她學跳舞了、現在她會跳狐步和一郎伯斯華克、可是「Jitterbuy」的步子還不曾學會、她又會開汽車、汽車照會也領到了、</p>

<h3>戲劇學校　米高梅公司出品　主演　露意絲安納　阿侖馬賽爾　寳蓮高黛</h3>
<p>「我領意有一天看見你怎樣成功，」安娜感到驚疑的。「白天要上學校，整夜又要做這低賤的工作。沒有一夜能舒舒服服的睡一覺。」她們的工作是在一家廠裏夜班裝配煤氣表。一班須工作十小時。一大羣萎頓的女子單調地動着她們的手絞緊皮條上移過來的機件上的螺絲。</p>
<p>露意絲說：「那是容易的。我總想着可憐的杜絲起初時常睡在公園的長凳上。」</p>
<p>但是那並不眞是容易的。每天地的眼獎次要閉合起來，她覺得腦袋是那末沉重的不易豎直在肩上。但是在戲劇學校裏她却必須直着！必須刻板的訓練擊劍，健身術和姿勢。接着又須演習戲劇，在演習時間內頭上要頂了書本走路，以得到完全的均衡。</p>
<p>她總是那麽疲乏。同學們——連敎師們——都相信她是太勤勉了。因為拙是太乏力了，不能高興快樂，他們以為她傲矜孤僻。露意絲不加理會。不僅是自尊心使她這樣，雖則她知道同學們如果發覺出一定會嘲笑她的「私人生活」的。她並不眞關心他們的取笑。但是她心內有一種造成一個新的個性的需求，來演她自己創造的角色。</p>
<p>「非常抱歉！」如果有人叫她加入同學們的課外游戰，她總是這麼對他們說。「我很歡喜參加，可是我工作太忙。」並沒有別的解釋。她這種熊度常使一部份同學不高興。她自己究竟以為自己是怎樣的人呢？　（未完）</p>

<h3>昨天足球義賽　南華凈勝混合隊　三比零馮景祥兩次頂上開花</h3>
<p>（本報零訊）昨天午後、天文台懸出七號風球、一般迷民、以爲赤　足球義賽、怕又不能舉行了、旣至五時、風雨猶未至、於是此幕三番改期的戰事，卒在加山演出、臨場　客、亦有數千、</p>
<p>線、有變動、聯隊多人缺席、乃臨時調南華球人加入客串、因此、聯隊的名義、應該取銷、改爲混合隊乃合、</p>
<p>侯容生仍爲混合隊効力、至南華右內衛一職、則由因足傷歛跡多時、至今已愈的麥紹漢出來担任、</p>
<p>戰時情形、開有耀彩、惟倖華惟對敵者有幾位是「自家人、　不免　下留情、故無劇烈的爭　、</p>
<p>南華諸鋒，殊見活躍、個別技術、如馮景祥、黎兆榮多曼妙之演出、更形成　意之臺　、羅斗文亦多隹作、李惠堂　　　　、鮮有活動機會，中間雖幾度乘隙射門、但不得逞、故　天實爲打破他本人人次出場必獲勝球的紀錄、中　劉慶才、一進一退、均能予前鋒與後衛以美大的助力、　餘諸子、亦均有滿意的　　、</p>
<p>混合　諸　合拍、未慣、演來視見各自爲戰、侯澄滔、拖般雖實、　　　　未能相機行事、每被南華守將集中截掠、楊水迭有敲門之機、惟射不中雀屏、中堅狄臣爲會塲最出色的一人、一面嚴密監現惠堂　一面予　　以佳妙的送傳、腳頭輕肱、踢來異常寫意、李安納反串內銜、亦見穩健、的架臣救囘不少險球、雖以三　零敗北、非其罪過、</p>
<p>南華隊</p>
<p>包家平</p>
<p>李天生　麥紹漢</p>
<p>李國戚　劉慶才　劉松生</p>
<p>羅斗文　黎明榮　李惠堂　馮景祥　鄧廣森</p>
<p>混合隊</p>
<p>的架臣</p>
<p>李安納　侯容生</p>
<p>許竟成　狄臣　楊根保</p>
<p>侯澄滔　桌石金　陳德輝　　般　　　益</p>
<p>佛爺欲開殺戒　德輝頂不開花</p>
<p>天容　　、風雨欲來、還幸老蒼有情、卒予方便、未再誤了這回　事遂在數千看客熱望的包圍中、依時揭開戰</p>
<p>號角一嗚、兩軍出動、互相戰了幾個囘合、忽見馮「二一」策馬挺進，賺竟成出擊、找着空位、送給「佛爺」一個很好的機會、王待描準「龍門」、欲開殺戒、</p>
<p>曉得　保　腰迎擊，一脚勾消「佛爺」的慾望、雖失角球、在所不　、</p>
<p>國威在中覯犯法、狄臣上開自由球、輕交水益、立即切中、云勢很妙，德輝人到球到、運用頭顱、向門一擊、奈何球兒中柱、彈出荒郊、然已嚇得家平一跳了、</p>
<p>斗文妙切角球　二叔　臚功</p>
<p>由是你攻過來，我段過去、情形　　緊張、尚覺悅目可　、已而「球怪」得球、發、左右、斗文得　　　　、拾遇根保力　，紙　成角球、開來妙　、要安納頂不着、的　臣　信空、　從「二　」頂上落、從　　　把頭一擬、遂打破的架臣的「閉關政策」、坐在我身旁的「陳老板」、對「二叔」此舉、讀美不置、</p>
<p>南華先勝、聲勢　盛，轉眼間，又見景活活、與兆榮一送一傳、如雙龍戲　，旣而迫近敵門、景祥卽施低射，但的架臣經方　間的教訓、巳有準備、呈球飛至　、急蹲着抱個滿懷、</p>
<p>球怪初次放砲　斗文迭有佳作</p>
<p>拖般蠢蠢思動、奈因前線各個不合作、沒法深入、偶見兩翼來一二次旁敲測擊、亦勞而無功</p>
<p>景祥的是好本領、中場運球、　到秋臣握摸不着、有頃、惠堂得景祥接濟、開放第一炮、却被的架臣救出</p>
<p>澄滔覓機進展、深入底線，但遇蘇仔一殺來、禾能再進、忙中切球、卻見「離題甚遠」、</p>
<p>斗文迭有佳作、甚滿人意、一次，他得兆　帮助、把球力傳、橫過「龍門」、剛落廣森脚下、廣森見此機會、怎肯放過、乃開弓猛　、卻被的架臣擋着、再由竟成解圍、</p>
<p>國威力纏　般、弄出侵人犯規、幸不在十二碼區內、由水益主歸、橫落澄滔方面、一頂不中、再爲水益所得、切傳甚妙、德輝　施以頂上功夫、卻落野外、</p>
<p>石金無善足陳　景祥又報一喜</p>
<p>斗文捲土重來、根保出而迎戰、却吃一個一　彈一、又負一記角球、斗交開來、惠常接着卽射、未命中、跟着惠常掩在左方底線、得　威妙傳、翻身叩門、演出絕妙、但被的架臣把球捉着、送出前方</p>
<p>石金三番四次、都不能推進、又與澄滔不合作、故無善足　、</p>
<p>不久、南華諸鋒、又在前方活動、兆榮得球、衝至底線、把球挑起、景祥乃出施故技、頂上開花、弄到的架臣不知所措、如驚弓之烏、望彈而飛、於是南華再下一城了、</p>
<p>此後南華仍多攻勢，有一次、斗文演出一個妙鏡頭，但景祥最後一射、卻被橫楣替的架臣擋了一場災、未幾、半場完了、</p>
<p>南華多事之秋　富士康將應付甚忙</p>
<p>略事休息、整戈再戰、混合隊的前線、至此時演出，較有生氣、不久、卽由澄滔得一一角球、但未收效果、</p>
<p>惠堂心欲立功、幾次運用突破之法、從中而入、惟被秋臣截於前、李安納阻於後、舉足不得、望門興嘆、</p>
<p>水益得機、沿邊進兵、迫成角球，開來恰到好處、荻臣截得即射、又成野矢、</p>
<p>此時混合隊諸　、活躍於南華禁地之內、嚴瑕　隙、乃成多事之秋、弄到天生、紹漢等頗忙、一次、水益近射，天生以背擋災、負記角球、水益開來、拖般接得扣關、但未中的、卻射中那龍門邊攝彩者的怊相機、跌落地下、未知拖般此舉、曾否攝入鏡頭、</p>
<p>家平化險爲夷　南華浄勝二球</p>
<p>忽然橫風斜雨，陣陣而來、南華逆風作戰、頗　威脅、惟混臺隊前綫聯絡散溫、雖有進展機會、亦不能建功、</p>
<p>有頃、水益走利本位、混入中路，把球傳給左方、澄滔得着近底線、撥交德輝、這是混合隊唯一致勝機會，眼看必入了、怎料德輝一射、竟中家平之手、順勢托出、化險爲夷、</p>
<p>根保作戰英勇、與兆榮爭球，打個觔斗、脫了褲帶、險些兒露出本來面目、惹得滿場大笑、</p>
<p>互相爭逐、各有進退、戰至最後一分鐘、容生奪球而出、踢送右方、水益不守位置、乃被國威截得、這一來、竟是南華再勝之機、球由國威送前、兆榮一截一交、恰從廣森跟前而落、他不俟球兒落塊、提腿卽扣、斜刺講入網、的架臣撲個　、此球旣入、停戰之笛隨嗚、南華遂以三比零淨勝、乃完成此次　筆、二雖收入不多、亦算功德無量了、（球場本歲）</p>

<h3>論上海日圓跌價</h3>
<p>如指使發行所謂「聯鈔」、以及使用軍用票、不料這類「鈔」與「票」、並不能與中國法幣對抗、而臼本爲要趁目前國際局勢緊張的時候、來完成　排斥在華歐美權益的「日圓集團」的企圖、乃用種種方、將日本鈔票運往中國、最近上海日圓的突增、恐怕就是這個原因、並目隨日軍流入中國淪陷區域的臼圓、無論是中國人或日本商民、都不敢把她當作可靠的財貨、在他們接受日元之後、或立卽換取法幣、或再從法幣以套取中國的外匯、於是這種日元也逐瀕向上海集中、終於衝動了市價、日本　府對於這種現象似乎也就早已料動、近數週內日本政府不准遊客携帶日圓赴日也不准用日幣償付由日本和東北運來上海的貨價、這就是防止臼壓跌價後逆襲日本、此外如與日圓有連繫的所謂「聯鈔」、最近跌價到百分之六十以下、新近成立的華興銀行、傅說將以日圓收買法幣、致市塲上實現大量日圓、所以目前日圓價　暴跌、實是多方湊合、必然的結果、日本大使館發言人究竟不是門外漢、</p>
<p>現時在中國的日圓、已成爲日本經濟上一個　瘤、日本所希望的、「日圓集團」、固然己經開始實行了、可是一個集團內的貨幣、總要具有同一的價值、而現在上每的日　外匯價值、僅及日本國內的臼圓外匯價值的二分之一、若是日本不盡力支持在華日圓的價值、反而割斷她那國內與國外日圓的連繫、那麼所謂日圓集傳的幻夢、就會迅連歸於消滅、但是她要極力支持弁華日圓的價格、她能爲日本膨漲在華　日圓、而增設巨大的外匯基金嗎、這不僅是目前日本的財力所不許、並且也　足以加速她國內貨幣制廣崩潰的危掛、</p>
<h3>舢舨駕駛法</h3>
<p>— 潘業紹</p>
<p>這裏所說的駕駛法、只限在舢舨以撓可舵　駕駛的範圍、能够把這些駕舟的技術學會了、雖然還有許多其他的須要學習、始能應付各種舟艇的駕駛、但把這種基　的技術學會了、對於具　駕舟術的學習、總多幫助、易于成功、</p>
<p>在　舟技術的範轉內、嚴　我們不單以學取這種技能爲資樂之用的、還兼顧到實用方面、則自通堂所見風帆的、雙橈的、獨櫓的、揮駛的　也無分其爲中外以至古式和新式、樣樣值得我們加以練習、以備萬一之需不過、一個精于單橈駛司舢　的、他在一片浮着的東西上、添以撥水條物的運用、　說舟艇之易于乘坐、就是几可浮水的、站在上面、他便能够推水前進、由此可知，我們不想有所成就于水上運動則已、否則此種技術的學習、價值至大、易言之、具有舢舨駕駛術的、在水上作消遣以求快慰、對于水上簡單工具的運用、不論平時或非常時期、爲甩極廣、</p>
<p>推舟前進並不難、能够在所駕舟的前進中隨意確定和轉變它的方向、兩都兼顧、倒叫一般學習者無所措手、不知如何才能達到獨自截駛舢　的目標。數此的原因、本是簡單不過的、</p>

<h3>一陣香風和猶太人</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>本港二十六日某報要聞版在「一陣香風通後，人人涕淚交流」的艷麗標題下，有這一則消息，敬錄如下：</p>
<p>「上海特訊，最近此間懷病一種，病狀頗奇，患者均涕淚交流，一如中催淚毒瓦斯，無法遏止，惟爲時甚暫甚暫……」</p>
<p>上海鬧市上居然發現這種「無法遏止」的怪病「」確是驚人的新聞「」爲了記者交代責任淸楚起見，記者還特別同此類怪病患者作一度談話，隨新聞發表，以證明消息來源的鑿確可信，下面就是特訊，記者的話：</p>
<p>「記者今日曾晤及患此病者，據稱在患病前，嗅覺感觸某種氣體，味甚芬芳，目覺淸涼，然罹病後刖頗不適，涕淚旁沱……」</p>
<p>由這段記者親目作證的報吿看釆，大概不會虛妄了罷？於是一般讀者的頭腦中，當然要大爲奇疑了，「何以大街止，　來毒瓦斯，聰明的記者卻寫出了答案說：</p>
<p>一或天猶太難民，大批到此，彼輩拂有各種專長，此或爲彼等之業醫者，故意散播一種化學氣體於上，以爲其謀生之術云」。</p>
<p>到底是否被逐失家的猶太人作的，先不必問，只是這裏的「或云」二字,恰像日本軍部在招待西國斯聞記者的舌人的口吻，傷倒霉哉，還是猶太難民。如果按我們一得之見，身懷催淚毒瓦斯的，大概不會是猶太難民，猶太難民雖然「挾有各種專長」但是在賣弄殺人競賽的按術上，他們遠不如名聞世界的日本軍人。日本在華各部作戰的兵士，都是懷有各式的毒瓦斯，這是人人共知的事實爲了進行某一種陰謀，日本人是不妨在上海大施毒瓦斯而反誣猶太人的，那不是事實麽？，當去年底德國納粹黨開始大逐猶　人時候，東方效頻的法西斯日本軍欄，不是也曾高唱過「猶太人都是共產黨」的邪論，而反猶總？那麼這次上海「一陣香風過處，人人涕淚交流」的兇手到底是甚麼人，自不雞想知。前天二十五日本港中國晚報曾有上海美聯社訊一則說：</p>
<p>「此間日文報紙，上海每日新聞，昨有社論第一次發長排猶言論，略謂歐洲之猶太難民九千人紛紛抵滬，虹口區域將爲猶太王國矣。猶人素以善于貿易著名，日人之權益恐將被危害……」</p>
<p>如巢與前文所舉的新聞合讀，個中奧妙更照然若揭。不過不詳察究竟的華人報紙，居然替日本人刊出這樣的奇聞來，無異是日本人盡了一份宣傳之責，聰明的讀者在此就須大睜你們的嚴睛了。</p>

<p>鍛治足以使人增加心力與體力，我們知道，魚在冰中忘記他們的腹請，雙目遂失明了，鹿因仰攀樹上的食精，頸項亦特殊發達，飽經襄患的舟人，怵目驚心巨浪與在濤，多次危險的覆舟，給安穩地應付了，通往的艱難，常是海上生涯的好教訓。</p>
<p>一個人向成長與健全中努力，是需要鍛治的。鍛冶往往是風波，是艱難，是憂患，是打擊，是練習與勞動。你不必駭怕，也不必退縮，對於你，這是二個好機會。你可以拿來利用，磨練，從若干艱難中，從困苦中，從不能中，從侮　中，你變成另一個人，你字典中無一難字，你視苦如薺，你化不能爲熱練，你含笑以仇人之首，試血你的呉鈎。</p>
<p>看吧，那是一個鐵匠的場工，星星在黑暗中閃眼，鎚一下下打擊在烙過的鐵上，在一方工場的大砧上，熊熊的火光中，迸發出紅的蛇舌，綠的火苗，有光的花朵，熱烈的高歌。雖然那是痛苦的激勵，毫不留情的打擊，使牠疼痛，使牠酸楚，使牠憤恨，也使牠悲嗚，但牠不流淚，不呻吟，不退縮，也不哭泣，他挺身，煎熬住　淚與悲哀，在巨砧上，在水釭中，在鐵鎚下。他被鍛治，被淬礪。</p>
<p>冷的溫暖，黑的發紅，脆的柔靭，經邊外力的折磨，鍜冶的鐵嘗通一番　苦，卸變得更潑刺，更勇敢，更堅強。</p>
<p>我們愛看火花星星，在黑夜中閃炮。我們愛聽釘鎚的急響，噹然發出巨聲。光與光相迸射，力與力相庫激，光是熱情的，力是龐大的。</p>
<p>我們須有光，我們須有熱——我們須鍛治，這是生存的試驗，這是死亡的威脅，這是辛酸的苦戰，這是預兆的凱歌，這是孤注的仇響，這是最後一粒蠢沙的掃蕩，這是痛苦的哀師，這是銅筋鐵骨的磨練。</p>
<p>「二次暴風雨的襲龑擊，瘋狂毀損了文明，暴力像鐵手，捏住了和平的心。世紀的不幸，使我們疼痛，酸楚，情恨，一悲嗚，但我們不流淚，不呻吟，不退縮。也不哭泣。我們須利用這困苦來磨練。多難來興邦，我們嚴肅地而又剛強接受下這一份禮物，——我們來鍛治。」</p>
<p>我們來鍛治，爲了成長與健全。</p>
<h3>團風的轟炸</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記—</p>
<p>黎明時候溫和的江風，撫慰着每一個征人，「多麽愉快啊」大家都這　嚷，俄而，太陽展開了笑臉，誠摯地吻着兩岸的山頭，似乎在表示說，「朋友，加緊努力吧，光明是永遠照臨着你們—」就在那天，我們一行九人，離間了武漢的懷抱，沿江順流東下，到達了長江北岸的團風。</p>
<p>團風是屬於湖北黃岡縣的首鎭，東南面的崢嶸二洲，獅子般的蹲　着，澎湃的江流，在他的脚下不斷地狂吼，據說，這裏便是晉劉裕大破桓玄處。在軍事上，黃崗上蔽武漢，下扼九江，形勢是非常重要的，所以團風就爲他們毀滅的目標，時常拚命地壘炸着。我們因爲要取道羅田入山，非從團風經過不可，並且還有點臨時的工作，所以就到了這裏。</p>
<p>船攏岸了，報吿空龑的鎭聲，突然響起來，江岸上擠擁着的人們，馬上向各處分散，正在嘈雜的早市，也消失於緊急的鐘聲底下。「他媽的！來吧，團風人是不怕死的」，街頭巷尾，在嘖　地詛咒着，連孩子們都忿恨得　睛裏爆出火來。眞的，民族的烈燄，跟着轟炸而蔓延，一直蔓延到任何一個角落裏，誰說沒有勝利的把握呢？</p>
<p>嗡嗡的聲昔從空中送來，全鎮沈靜得像一座孤墓：但街頭上的脚步聲，還隱隱地可以聽到，這是憲兵在巡邏，防止「信號」的發現。當我　大街拐灣的時候，忽然有一隻手放到我的肩腂上，「啊，你來了，晚上的軍民聯誼會準時舉行嗎？」駐防團風的方師長，出現在街梢頭，這種鎮靜如常的態度，當然是久經戰陣的。「卽使把團風炸成了平地，我們仍要舉行！……」話還沒有說完，七架轟炸機，已經在上空盤旋了。</p>
<p>「還有五架！…啊，分隊了！…」不知誰在談論着。</p>
<p>轟——轟——</p>
<p>炸彈爆裂的響聲，跟山崩似的　續着，黑烟布滿了四周，不知那裏飛起一株樹，從烟霧中掉下來，倒在冲激的沙灘上。瓦片，磚頭，碎石，跟冰雹一樣，在各處飛射着。每顆炸彈落地的瞬間，防空壕洞口就霍地撲進一陣大風。這樣繼續了三刻鐘光景，才始停止了，救護隊和消防隊馬上出動，分頭進行着應做的工作，但說也奇怪，大轟炸的結果，除掉一頭黃牛死於非命之外，團風還是完整的。</p>
<h3>短命的艷花</h3>
<p>— 俊伯</p>
<p>該說一枝艷花替世界添了多美　嗎？朋友，你說，你有的是聰明的頭腦。這靑葱的枝條，該是短命的艷花壯實的象徵嗎？你瞧，那副高傲的模樣，偷攝了日月的光彩，借一席風輕，搬弄着傲慢的嬌笑。這眞够丟臉的，它一笑的殷動，偷換了幾多小花的精靈。朋友，莫也動了情，關了你心上的，別理會她嫵媚的搬弄。</p>
<p>是的，你說得好，摘了它也不算是個罪過，砍了它的根，折了它的枝，看它再有多大能耐，用粗魯的足尖，搗了蚯蚓的家。</p>
<p>敏捷的燕雀是不願把細經擒住它的枝幹的，這原是它的造孽，有誰肯把靑春倚住它，訴說衷腸的根情，除非　幾隻醜蝦蟆，　把引長的頭頸擱上它的褪，吐一曲嘶啞的聲調，博得它一二偏靑睞，朋友，別儘吧着氣，看我們的臂膊。那是够強健的。</p>
<p>誰說它眞是個不壞的金剛，是短命的，不久就有枯萎的一朝，　我們喊，震撼她的心，「短命的續花，呸？當心你的年華！」</p>
<h3>歸鄉途中（下）</h3>
<p>— 王里</p>
<p>在鎭裏，駐着一個友軍的隊伍，我通過橋的時候，橋上站着的崗兵，把我的證件看了又看，很仔細的的盤問了一囘，才放我通過，鎮上的房屋，注滿了友軍，我找了很久，才於一家茶館裏借着了宿處，晚上把兩個茶桌，拚着睡了一夜。</p>
<p>第二天午後，我到達了黎莊橋。因爲至武進的航船已開，須待明天八時，才能搭到船，於是我就在這裏停下了脚。</p>
<p>我在一家茶館門首經過的時候，忽然一個不熟悉的人在我的背後把我一把抓住了。我一下受驚而愕然着，那個人卻微笑地看着我，指着菜舘的店堂內對我說：「他們的班畏請你！」</p>
<p>我更惶恐起來。</p>
<p>待我把眼晴向店堂內注視時，我才發現了一個微笑着向我的，我們的偵察班長的臉。我於是喜欣地跨了進去。</p>
<p>「你怎麽也到了這裏？」他先帶着笑臉問我。</p>
<p>「你們怎麼到這裏的呢？」我反問着。</p>
<p>隨後，他們告訴我捉到一個人的事情，並且把所搜到的文件給我看。</p>
<p>因爲我本來身子有點不好，又走了長路，頭有點暈眩，所以預備找個地方睡一下，於是一個新加入我們偵察班的本地同志，就堅請代我去一家旅館事開了一個房間。</p>
<p>次日上午八時，我搭了去武　的航船，因爲頭還有點最眩，我把包袱枕着身子，倒臥着。</p>
<p>船到了一個小村子的時候，下來了一個戴着黑眼鏡的人，當時誰也沒有注意到他，可是船到半路，是對方與我們的勢力的間隙之地，我正在朦朧的遐思，突然爲一個聲音所驚醒，囘　看時，帶黑眼鏡的那個人，手執着駁壳槍，從船銷後竄了出來。</p>
<p>「大家識相點。」</p>
<p>他用槍口指着們喝着，</p>
<p>全船的人都　然了。</p>
<p>他開飴用一隻手搜着每人的身邊，搜得了東西，就很快的向衣袋裏塞。</p>
<p>這時我暗藏了一般憤怒，預備他搜到我的時候，就給他一個冷不防，拍掉他的鎗。我做着無事似的，微閉着眼，依舊側臥地準備有。可是他抄了一陣，却把我遣漏掉，戚脅船靠了岸，就逸去了。</p>
<p>一路上，船裏的人喧鬧着，相互地責怪着。</p>
<p>晚上六時，我踏上了另一個世界的土地。帶着　走入了地獄的感覺，我在燈火輝煌的武進街道上走着。</p>
<p>我看着熙攘往來的同胞，木立在街道上的偽警，耀眼的霓釘燈，焦木碎磚的敗屋……我默默的咬着牙，暗暗的流着悲憤之淚！</p>
<p>因爲我沒有良民證，走徧了所有的旅館，多遭了拒絕。最後，幾個老百姓指示了我秘密的旅館，並叫一個小孩子帶領我去。</p>
<p>這是在瓦礫堆中，一所用木板簡陋地修理了的半毀的房子，裏面像豬窩一樣的髒，地上放　幾張蓆子，另外一間有着二個破床。</p>
<p>這一夜，我頭很暈眩，身子很疲乏，但是興奮地睡不去，眼睜睜一直　了天亮</p>
<p>第二天，我逃過了打防疫針，搭了到無錫的輪船，午後換船到蘇州。</p>
<p>一路，我從船窗裏向外望着，所經過的鄉鎭，已半成了焦土。默默地，我讓仇恨之火，燃燒着了我的心，我又記慮着我的故鄉。</p>
<p>——鄉大概　已成了焦土吧？</p>
<p>我悲長地揣測着。但是我馬上責儀着自己不應這樣想，我們這麼大的土地已被佔去，數千萬的同胞失去了生命，失去了財產與自由，我不能私心地希望故鄉獨存，不能私心地吝惜我的故鄉</p>
<p>到蘇州的途中，受了五次的檢查，在五次的查時，我是用了全身的力量抑制住了怒火。怒火把我的暈眩的頭更燒得暈眩了起來，身體像害了大病一樣的軟弱。</p>
<p>在蘇州宿了一夜，我搭了到故鄉的輪船。</p>
<p>在遠遠地看到了故鄉的時候，一種旣不是悲也不是的喜混亂的情緒，擾着了我的頭腦。</p>
<p>踏上了故土，我感到雖未經大災的故鄉，是已在壓迫下變了樣了。</p>
<p>在父親與弟弟的驚喜之下相見了後，我的心也像落掉了一塊重壓的鉛一樣輕鬆了。我們懷着似再世相見的心，互述着在這巨劫中別愛的一年餘的一切。</p>
<p>在興奮過後，我病着的身體，就　去了弦的弓一樣，鬆弛而無力了！我偷看着我父親的臉，父親在這一年餘中卻顯得老了許多了！</p>

<h3>Strengthening Japan's Policy Towards Third Countries</h3>
<p>Recent developments in Japan's foreign policy involve the active and reckless actions of military personnel stationed abroad, backed and supported by domestic public opinion. The Japanese military's mouthpiece and its affiliated newspapers have extensively discussed the new direction of Japan's policy towards third countries, concluding that a hardline approach is necessary. This is a response to the setbacks of the Japanese military's aggression in China, which has reached a point where further advancement is difficult. However, they are shifting the blame onto third countries. While the Japanese government constantly dreams of adjusting diplomatic relations in all aspects, its military personnel abroad are venting their anger on foreign nations due to the military stalemate. They believe that China is resisting Japan with the support and protection of Britain, America, and France. Therefore, their first step is to eliminate the influence of these countries in China. This is not just an issue of economic interests; they are particularly concerned about political matters. They aim to strictly blockade the Chinese coast, disregarding international conventions and arbitrarily detaining and inspecting ships from third countries. Furthermore, they are actively seeking to invade third country concessions in China. They have been causing disturbances in Tianjin and Shanghai for quite some time, and although Britain, America, and France have expressed strong opposition to the landing incident in Gulangyu, the situation remains deadlocked. Now, the dispute over concessions is no longer merely a temporary issue, and following the reckless actions of the military, the Japanese government seems inclined to adopt new measures.</p>
<p>The nature of Japanese capitalism often causes its foreign policy to follow a path of reversal, similar to the development process of its domestic politics and economy. That is, political economics advance along with the military. Military personnel stationed abroad often disregard the policies of their domestic government and adopt their own independent measures. For example, regardless of how high-profile the Hiranuma cabinet's calls for "friendship with all nations" are, or how much Foreign Minister Arita flirts with the American ambassador, or even how urgently Japan currently needs material support from Britain and America, they stubbornly insist on excluding the economic and even political interests of Britain, America, and France. They consistently aim to create so-called "faits accomplis" first, and then leave the diplomatic authorities to negotiate.</p>
<p>Behind military actions, they incite public opinion to echo their views. Under the surveillance and command of the military's bayonets, newspapers that echo the military's outrageous statements are no longer limited to the military's mouthpiece, such as "国民新闻," or its affiliated "读卖新闻." Even "朝日新闻," which has traditionally maintained a more moderate stance, has now put forward hardline proposals. According to some sources, "朝日新闻" has even suggested three ways to deal with the concessions of third countries in China: (1) Allowing the puppet government to reclaim all foreign concessions; (2) Amending the land regulations; (3) Maintaining the status quo while requiring all countries to cooperate with Japan, which in other words means increasing Japan's position. Its conclusion is that the third method has failed, and the second method has not made any progress. Therefore, the first method should be adopted immediately.</p>
<p>They even emphasize that adopting the first method is feasible because there are precedents. Therefore, they are preparing to seize the concessions of third countries in China by force, absolutely excluding their interests. What is particularly surprising is that the Minseito party, which has traditionally represented the interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, is now also advocating a tough stance on foreign policy. This further demonstrates that Japanese politics often follows the military's lead, while also reflecting the internal contradictions and complexities of politics.</p>
<p>However, we must remind ourselves that this reckless behavior of Japan's military, which prioritizes military power, still carries elements of risk and probing. This has always been their style. The outbreak of the "September 18th Incident" may not have been the foreign policy of the Japanese government at the time. Therefore, Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara still emphasized the theory of "swallowing the bomb." Military probing must succeed before diplomacy can step in to negotiate. Japanese militarists are once again revisiting many old dreams. How Britain, America, and France, which have now become the targets of their probing, should deal with Japan is an important issue. If they cannot respond to this probing with "armored fists" (as Masataka Nakano said), the danger ahead is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Educational Issues During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Chen Lifu</p>
<p>We must understand that a nation can only embark on the path of national rejuvenation through effective education. The work of "Resisting Japan and Building the Nation" is like constructing a great project. Before the project begins, there must be a precise plan, including the phasing of the project, the allocation of materials, and the estimation of labor. Then, a detailed engineering drawing should be prepared, and the "chief engineer" should lead many skilled workers to work hard to complete this great project. Today, our "chief engineer" for nation-building is our supreme leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and the general youth are the skilled workers of the future. The Three Principles of the People are the overall engineering drawings, and the Outline of National Reconstruction is the phasing diagram of the project. It divides the project into three stages: military administration, political tutelage, and constitutional government, to complete the solid foundation of nation-building. The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction are the detailed drawings of each part of the project. They tell us how many miles of railways and highways are needed, and how to develop mineral resources, improve agriculture, and develop water conservancy and industry, and so on. Therefore, under the leadership of the chief engineer, Generalissimo Chiang, we should deeply explore and understand the various conditions of the project—nation-building—especially the entire engineering drawing—the Three Principles of the People. This is very important in the current stage. Our Three Principles of the People were invented through Premier Sun's forty years of revolutionary experience and theoretical research. They encompass ancient Chinese political philosophy and the refinement of various schools of Western political thought. Now, the planner of our overall engineering drawing—Premier Sun—has passed away, and his successor—Generalissimo Chiang—is working hard to lead the people of the whole country—especially the general youth—to shoulder the sacred task of resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the responsibility of the general youth is so great! To enable the general youth to fulfill their responsibilities, we cannot but talk about education. The sages told us the importance of the four characters "管" (control), "教" (teach), "養" (nurture), and "衛" (protect), because in everything in the world, if you want to achieve the goal of success, you cannot escape these four characters. If we want to save China and revive the nation, we also rely entirely on these four characters as the foundation. In other words, these four characters are the fundamental conditions that must be met to complete the great cause of nation-building. Now, I will explain their meanings separately:</p>
<p>The first goal of education is "自治治事" (self-governance and managing affairs), that is, to enable the educated to be able to, first, self-govern, second, govern others, and third, manage affairs. However, society is inherently complex and prone to evil. People's surroundings contain great attraction. In physics, it is said that "attraction arises when two objects are together," and its formula is 　 Mencius also said, "Objects attract each other." Living in the universe, people naturally cannot avoid being attracted by external forces. Buddhism says that the six senses of eyes, ears, mouth, nose, body, and mind are the six desires, which are most likely to have causes and conditions with external forces. The more extravagant a person's desires are, the greater the effect of external forces. Once seduced by external forces, they lose their ability to self-govern and are controlled by external forces. As a result, corruption, fraud, bribery, and all kinds of evils arise, without end. Therefore, the primary goal of today's education is to cultivate young people's ability to "自治" (self-govern), "治人" (govern others), and "治事" (manage affairs) to control external forces, rather than being controlled by them, to change the environment, rather than being changed by the environment, and to ensure that they can "富貴不能淫" (not be corrupted by wealth), "貧賤不能移" (not be swayed by poverty), and "威武不能屈" (not be subdued by force). Everyone knows that Yan Hui was Confucius's favorite disciple. When Yan Hui died, Confucius was extremely saddened. Why? Because Yan Hui was able to control himself, simplifying his own life and not being tempted by things, and diligently serving others without getting tired. "A basket of rice, a gourd of water, living in a humble alley, others cannot bear the sorrow, but Yan Hui does not change his joy." This is proof of Yan Hui's noble personality, and it is also why Confucius loved and respected him. Mencius also said: "The way of learning is nothing but to seek one's lost mind." Only when a person can control his mind can he talk about self-governance. Only when one can self-govern can he manage others and gain their respect. Otherwise, if one is corrupt himself but tells others not to be corrupt, if one does not share joys and sorrows with the soldiers but asks them to endure hardship, that is absolutely impossible. Didn't the ancients say it? "If one is upright, he will be followed without orders; if one is not upright, he will not be followed even with orders." During the retreat from Wuhan, our supreme leader set an example by leaving Hankou only after everyone else had evacuated. This is such a great expression of personality. The reason why schools must be strictly managed now is to abandon this pure environment and train the backbone of society in the future—the youth. Because if students in school do not cultivate their minds and bodies enough, they can easily fall into a bad environment and go with the flow without stopping. Therefore, young students in school should establish a revolutionary outlook on life, cultivate morality and improve themselves, in order to lay the foundation for future behavior in the world. One must first self-govern before he can govern others, and one can only manage affairs after he can govern others. The so-called way of beginning and end in the university lies in this.</p>
<p>The second goal of education is "自養養人" (self-sufficiency and supporting others). If one cannot make a living after being educated, then he is a disabled person; if one has the ability to earn fifty yuan but wants to spend one hundred yuan, then the income and expenses can never be offset, and one will be destroyed, which is a crime against the country. Therefore, after young students leave school, they should strive for hard work and thrift in consumption. Whenever you do something, you must start from the bottom and work your way up. For example, I originally studied mining. After graduating, I worked as a dirty miner. Now, if I am handling mining affairs, if someone is deceiving me about the miners, I can definitely find out, because I have completely gone through the difficult stages of the lower level. Similarly, when we go to the army, we must start from the squad leader and platoon leader, so that we can see the real situation at the lower level. A person who can be better than others lies in his rich experience, broad knowledge, and high morality. Therefore, the general youth should use this precious period of life—from the age of twenty to thirty—as a period of preparation for learning and practice. If a solid foundation can be laid in this period, they can become useful talents in the future. Now, some young people often neglect the exploration of profound knowledge and international economics, and only know how to exclude each other and compete for the height of their position. They only see the present and do not see the distant and bright future, which is really a sign of national subjugation. We must know that the youth of today are the mainstay of nation-building in the future, and in terms of academic experience, they must be slowly cultivated from low to high, like a "pyramid." Although it takes a long time, the effect is really great. In terms of morality, we must try our best to reduce our private life. If you are able to be honest and upright in the agency, and have clean hands, then "合則留，不合則去" (if you agree, stay; if you disagree, leave), and have no desire to stay in office, execute your tasks, judge the rights and wrongs of others, and not be restrained or threatened by others. Therefore, we must try our best to be frugal in school, so that we can avoid the evil path of corruption in the future and complete our great careers. Confucius said: "君子憂道不憂貧" (A gentleman worries about the way, not poverty), and also said: "士志於道，而恥惡衣惡食者，未足與議也" (A scholar who aspires to the way but is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not worth discussing with). This is really an attitude that a person should adopt when dealing with the world. Our leader's family eats three vegetarian dishes and one soup for each meal, and sometimes they are even too busy to eat. Look at how frugal and hard-working this is. Duke Zhou, as the royal assistant, still "一沐三握髮，一飯三吐哺" (washed his hair three times in one bath and spit out his food three times in one meal), and even "思兼三王，以施四事，其有不合者，仰而思之，夜以繼日，坐以待旦" (considered the achievements of the three kings and applied them to the four affairs, and if there was anything that did not fit, he would look up and think about it, day and night, sitting and waiting for dawn), working diligently for the country, to such an extent, that he was able to lay the foundation for the eight hundred years of the Zhou Dynasty. Now, the affairs of the public—the political departments—are becoming more and more complicated, and it is not enough to rely on the efforts of our leader alone. We also need the efforts of all skilled workers—the general youth. Therefore, modern youth must not only have the ability to support themselves, but also plan to support others. Premier Sun said: Those who are smarter and more capable often use their abilities to serve thousands of people and create blessings for thousands of people; those who are slightly less intelligent and capable should use their abilities to serve ten to a hundred people and create blessings for ten to a hundred people; as for those who have no intelligence or ability at all, they should also use their own abilities to serve one person and create blessings for one person, which is what he meant.</p>
<h3>The Current Way Out for Youth (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Feng Wenbin's speech, special correspondent from Xi'an</p>
<p>The third goal of education is "自衡衛團" (self-defense and defending the community). In order to shoulder the more difficult task after winning the War of Resistance, we must first have a healthy body and cultivate a spirit that can withstand frost and dew and endure wind and snow. This is not only about strengthening the individual, but also about seeking the health of the nation. Therefore, the general youth must pay attention to general exercises and military training in schools, because the purpose of military training is to cultivate the healthy spirit of the nation. At present, the proportion of young people who are physically qualified is very small on average. Thinking about the mostly weak masses, how can China not be in danger? Therefore, I advocate that physical exercise should have a certain standard, the so-called "格" (standard). In the past, the physical fitness of the general people of our country was very strong, but later, due to the concept of fair-skinned scholars as the beauty of scholars, the nation gradually fell into a state of weakness. We should change the concept of beauty to "those who are physically fit are called beautiful," and promote it to form a trend, so that everyone regards being strong as natural and being weak as shameful. We should universally promote military training and advocate health campaigns. In this way, in addition to strengthening the physical fitness of individuals, we can also improve the health of the entire nation. Everyone can defend themselves, everyone can defend the country, and the nation will be strong, and the country's status will naturally increase.</p>
<p>Finally, the purpose of education itself is "自信信道" (self-confidence and believing in the way). The so-called self-confidence is to enable the educated to have the ambition to complete their own responsibilities and missions; at that time, they should establish a common belief in the country, and based on this belief, work together to promote the construction of the country, which is the so-called belief in the way, or in other words, belief in isms. The Three Principles of the People are still the main line for our nation to seek survival, and can also be said to be the common path we take today, and the responsibility of educators is to understand the Three Principles of the People and seek their implementation. Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean says: "修道之謂教" (Cultivating the way is called teaching).</p>
<p>The meanings of the above are integrated as follows: 1. Teach—self-confidence and believing in the way, 2. Control—self-governance and managing affairs, 3. Nurture—self-sufficiency and supporting others, 4. Protect—self-defense and defending the country. Only when young people have these four elements can they be standard youth. If a country is composed of such youth, then the country will naturally have the four major conditions of control, teaching, nurturing, and protection. If only half of the four conditions are met, that is, only self-confidence, self-governance, self-sufficiency, and self-defense, but not believing in the way, managing affairs, supporting others, or defending the country, then only the effort of establishing oneself has been completed, which is just passing the exam. It is of no benefit to society. Living is not worthy of respect, and death is not worthy of pity. Congo fundamentally cannot meet any of the conditions. Such youth are better off dead than alive. The standard youth we hope for are everyone with the above sixteen characters, who is a national with a sound personality.</p>
<p>Therefore, I now hope that the general youth can seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cultivate the ability of "自信信道" (self-confidence and believing in the way), "自治治事" (self-governance and managing affairs), "自養養人" (self-sufficiency and supporting others), and "自銜衛國" (self-defense and defending the country) to complete the sound personality of a revolutionary. The responsibility for building the nation in the future is really on our shoulders!</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Our efforts need to have a certain direction.</p>
<p>The most basic of all directions is the unity of all young people. Only by establishing a strong united front of young people to resist Japan and save the country can we have hope of victory.</p>
<p>A serious problem placed in front of all Chinese youth is the problem of liberation and destruction. If we unite, we can be liberated; if we split, we will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Because at present, it is an emergency moment for the survival of our great nation with a history of four to five thousand years. The × people have penetrated our hearts and occupied almost all of our famous cities and towns and transportation hubs. As long as we relax, the vast land left to us by our ancestors will be completely occupied by the × people, and the long-standing culture left to us will be completely destroyed by the × people, and our descendants will forever be slaves of the × people.</p>
<p>Everyone is under the same threat, and everyone has to choose one of the paths between victory and destruction.</p>
<p>If we are like a dish of loose sand and fight on our own, or even resist Japan while fighting and rubbing against each other, we will inevitably be defeated by the × people one by one. Therefore, unity is necessary. Unity was needed in the past, and unity is needed even more when the war is critical. Everyone needs unity, and young people with strong vitality, who are the lifeline of the country, need unity even more. Unity means life, division means death.</p>
<p>Only if all Chinese young men and women, regardless of class, party, belief, or race, as long as they are unwilling to be subjugated and exterminated, as long as they are willing to live a human life and live a free and happy life, work together closely and unite, can this be the only way out for our youth.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese ××× August 1st Declaration and the Beiping students' December 9th Movement in 1935, united resistance against Japan for national independence, democratic freedom, and people's happiness has become the common demand of the vast majority of young people across the country. Nineteen months ago, the first representative conference of the Northwest Youth National Salvation Association made a concrete proposal for the unity of young people across the country:</p>
<p>"1. Regardless of party, class, belief, or gender, all young people across the country should unite under the goal of resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
<p>2. Abandon partisan prejudices and mutual attacks. Youth organizations in various parts of the country should cooperate with each other to create unified youth organizations across the country and in various regions.</p>
<p>3. Decisions should be made by the majority under democratic principles, and the leading bodies should be elected by the majority.</p>
<p>4. Representatives should be mutually elected by young people from all over the country to convene a national youth national salvation representative conference to decide on a common program for resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
<p>5. Fight for all improvements in young people's lives, economy, and politics."</p>
<p>This proposal represents the universal demands of young people across the country. With the outbreak and progress of the old resistance, the understanding of the need for youth to unite has become even more certain throughout the country. Generalissimo Chiang said well in his letter to the youth of the country on June 16, 1938:</p>
<p>"If we want to win the war and build the country, we must cultivate the deep strength of the country and the nation as its foundation, and the so-called deep strength of the country and the nation is the awakening and unity of the youth of the whole country."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>We must unite, and we can unite.</p>
<p>We can unite, first of all because we have common interests. We have a common × enemy, Japanese imperialism, and a common cause, resisting Japan and building the country. They are common to young people of all classes and parties, and they are also common to young people of all regions and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The aggression of Japanese imperialism has broken our old boundaries.</p>
<p>The students in Beiping had disputes between the old student union and the new student union, and even bloodshed occurred. When the × people came, they not only forced them to receive the slave education of the traitors, but also forced them to participate in the "celebration" parade when Taiyuan fell. At this time, the old and new student unions who stayed in Beiping hid in a room and cried together. The old prejudices no longer existed.</p>
<p>The × people ruined the bronze statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai and the mausoleum in Nanjing, and also insulted the temples of Buddhism and Lamaism. The × people conspired to use the methods of Prince De to deceive the Hui people to establish the so-called Hui Hui State, but at the same time they used planes to bomb the Hui people and force the young Hui compatriots to eat meat.</p>
<p>Chinese youth of all classes, parties, regions, and ethnic groups have shed their hot blood all over the battlefield of national self-defense. Their blood flows together, merges together, and it is impossible to distinguish which party, region, or race it is. This is the ironclad evidence that Chinese youth can unite. (Applause)</p>
<p>The representatives at our meeting include young people from the Kuomintang, young people from the Communist Party, and young people who are non-partisan. Our representatives include both men and women in terms of gender, and workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and businessmen in terms of social composition. Our representatives come from various provinces in the Northwest and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, as well as from the rear and behind enemy lines in the war zones of Suiyuan, Northwest Shanxi, West Shanxi, Southwest Shanxi, Southeast Shanxi, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, Central Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Southeast Shandong, Henan, the two Hubei provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, as well as from Korea and various parts of Nanyang. We are all of one mind and purpose, for the unity of the youth, to study the experiences and future of the Chinese youth movement. Everyone has come from thousands of miles away, loving each other like blood brothers and sisters born of the same mother. This is also the ironclad evidence that Chinese youth can unite. (Applause)</p>
<p>And our unity has many favorable conditions.</p>
<p>First, we have the anti-Japanese national united front as our foundation. What is the backbone of the anti-Japanese national united front? It is the Kuomintang of China and the Communist Party of China. The Kuomintang is the party that holds power today. Its leader, Generalissimo Chiang, made it clear in an interview with a special correspondent from the Paris Evening Post in April 1938: "The National Government is willing to join hands with all parties to deal with the common × enemy under the condition that Mr. Sun's principles are not violated." The ××× is the ×××× of the ×××. Everyone knows that it is the earliest and most ×× advocate of the anti-Japanese national united front, and the most ×××× supporter and promoter. ××× pointed out to the people of China the overall plan for the struggle of the anti-Japanese national united front, and made every effort to realize it. Similarly, it also pointed out to the youth of China the overall guiding principle for the struggle of the youth united front, and helped to realize it in all aspects. Without the Kuomintang, without the ×××, there would be no youth in the national united front:</p>
<p>Second, our youth not only have the firm determination to unite to resist Japan, but also have the common demand to realize democracy and improve people's livelihood. Every one of our youth is eager to realize a democratic and free politics. On this point, young people of all parties and all classes can not only obtain the basis for unity, but also obtain the guarantee for unity. The so-called democratic freedom should first guarantee the freedom of thought, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. The Three Principles of the People is not only a doctrine of national liberation, but also a doctrine of democratic freedom and the improvement of people's livelihood. It is precisely because of this that the Three Principles of the People is supported by the vast majority of young people and has become an important weapon for youth unity.</p>
<p>Some people think that since we already have the Three Principles of the People, we should no longer allow other thoughts and beliefs to exist at the same time. This is a misunderstanding of the Three Principles of the People, a misinterpretation of them, and a removal of the advantages of the Three Principles of the People. One of the main advantages of the Three Principles of the People is that it adheres to the freedom of thought and belief.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen explained the Three Principles of the People by saying: "Nationalism is to fight against injustice abroad, and democracy is to fight against injustice at home... To fight against domestic autocracy, we must apply the Three Principles of the People and promote the rights of the people; to promote the rights of the people is to promote the principle of the public world."</p>
<p>As early as the Kuomintang declaration on January 1, 1931, it clearly "determined that the people have the absolute freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief." The Outline of Resistance and Nation-Building, which is based on the Three Principles of the People, also stipulates in Article 26: "During the War of Resistance, within the scope of not violating the highest principles of the Three Principles of the People and laws, legal and full protection should be given to speech, publication, assembly, and association." In order to implement this article, the central government has repeatedly emphasized this to the local authorities to show its seriousness.</p>
<p>Can we use the Three Principles of the People to oppose the Principle of Democracy, or use the Outline of Resistance and Nation-Building to oppose Article 26 of the Outline of Resistance and Nation-Building? Obviously not.</p>
<p>Some people also think that although the Three Principles of the People includes the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, we cannot advocate them now. We should advocate them after the success of nationalism. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Brewing of a Major Battle on the Hunan-Hubei Border: Hubei Troops Constantly Moving South to Concentrate; Northern Hunan Tense, Troops Advancing on Three Routes</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency] Currently, there have been no changes on the battle lines of Hunan and Hubei provinces. A thousand Japanese soldiers in Yueyang, once attempting to cross the Xinqiang River southward under the cover of airplanes and heavy artillery, were driven back to the north bank after several hours of confrontation between the two armies, suffering heavy casualties with over a hundred bodies left behind. Yesterday, on the west bank of Dongting Lake, a Japanese gunboat and seven motorboats sailed near Huarong and Nanxian counties, opening fire and shelling, then leaving that evening. Currently, an encounter battle has occurred between the two armies on the Wuchang-Changsha highway. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is planning a large-scale offensive, as Japanese troops are constantly being reinforced in Yueyang. As for southern Hubei, six thousand Japanese troops attempted to attack Zaoshi and Yuejiakou but consistently failed. Currently, the Japanese army is constantly transferring troops from Yingshan and Kaitianmen to reinforce their forces in that area. In northern Hubei, east of Xiangyang and west of Suixian, there is no trace of the Japanese army, as they have retreated to Zhongxiang and Jingshan. As for Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, they are reportedly in a state of calm.</p>
<p>[Guilin, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] On the morning of the 26th, troops in northern Hunan, divided into three groups, each with infantry and artillery, totaling about five hundred, launched an attack on Ganshi Gengkouxianjiadazhong. The battle at Yanjia Mountain was the fiercest and is still raging.</p>
<p>[Changsha, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The motorboats operating in Dongting Lake, repeatedly attempting to land on the lake surface of the eastern shore, Lujiaoshi, without success, again sailed to the lake surface of Maizhoupu, east of Huarong on the western shore, at 9:00 AM on the 28th to cause disruption. They were bravely repelled by our forces.</p>
<p>[Miluo, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The battle situation on the north bank of the Xinqiang River returned to calm on the 28th. Troops on the Zhe River are currently constructing fortifications in the area within eighteen miles of the north bank, forming a confrontational state with our army at Tangjiapai, Yanjia, Daxiaolongwan Bridge, and Gengkou. This time, the enemy attempted to destroy our guerrilla base on the north bank with heavy troops, but after a week of fierce fighting, it has obviously failed.</p>
<p>[Changde, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] According to a telephone call from Shashi, troops trapped in the Dahong Mountains, suffering heavy casualties and lacking ammunition and provisions, withdrew to the vicinity of Anlu on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Fancheng, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] In the recent battle situation in central Hubei, apart from our army controlling troops in the Dahong Mountains and a certain guerrilla unit constantly attacking, the entire front line is calm.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] There is currently no change in the situation between Jiangmen and Xinhui. On the 27th, a certain unit of our forces advanced towards the Guanshan Mulang area and engaged in contact with the enemy, and fierce fighting continued until late at night.</p>
<p>[Zhaoqing, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] On the morning of the 27th, over three hundred troops from Sanshui, with several artillery pieces, attacked Lucun from the southwest. Our guerrilla team, together with local villagers, cooperated in resisting, and after three hours of mutual combat, the enemy, unable to withstand, fled in disarray.</p>
<p>[A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 17th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Enemy troops in Lianghuai repeatedly attacked without success. Later, they raided Shunheji and Gaoliangjian on the west bank of the Grand Canal and were attacked by our army separately. Fierce fighting continued for days, and the enemy still failed and fled. Gaoliangjian has been officially recovered by our forces.</p>
<h3>British General Issues Strong Note to Japan: Refuses to Discuss Shanghai Concession Issue; Vehemently Condemns Illegal Blockade of Our Coastline; US and French Governments Will Also Express the Same Attitude</h3>
<p>[London, 27th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] News from well-informed sources here tonight states that the British government is currently preparing to issue a note to Japan to discuss the issue of Chinese public concessions. This is the result of talks between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the person in charge of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the previous two days. London had ordered Craigie to inquire whether the statement made by a Japanese spokesman to reporters the day before regarding the request to manage our country's public concessions was indeed the sincerity of the Japanese government. According to the reply, it was indeed the intention of the Japanese government. The full text of the British note is currently in progress, and it is said that its tone is quite strong. The British government is only willing to discuss the issue of public concessions with the Japanese government before returning the concession territory to the Chinese government in the distant future. However, since all public concessions are currently within the areas occupied by the Japanese army, it is impossible to return them to the Chinese government for the time being. The United Kingdom believes that the entire issue is difficult to discuss further. It is also learned that the US and French governments will also express the same attitude towards the public concession issue, but as of now, the British government has not made this request to Paris or New York. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the British note to Japan will strongly condemn Japan's declaration of the illegality of blockading the Chinese coast and will point out that the so-called blockade is not within Chinese territorial waters, and since Japan has no rights enjoyed by belligerent countries and has unjustifiably stopped all foreign ships from sailing without a declaration of war, it is not in accordance with reason. In the event of British and American cooperation, it would only cause economic difficulties for Japan and could indirectly cut off its supply of munitions. According to the Sunday Times, Roosevelt can implement neutrality towards Japan, such as a law prohibiting the supply of munitions to belligerent countries if Japan declares war. The report continued that more than 80 percent of Japan's munitions come from the United States.</p>
<h3>China and Communications Banks Establish Small Loans to Relieve Chongqing Disaster Victims; The Two Banks Have Allocated 400,000 Yuan to Provide Interest-Free Loans to Bombed Industrial and Commercial Circles</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Associated Press] Financial circles here told reporters yesterday that the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are now conducting small loans. Small merchants, small factory owners, and small vendors who have lost all their family property due to the recent bombing by Japanese aircraft can go to borrow money without interest. Those who borrow money to purchase goods have a term of three months, while those who purchase tools and machinery have a limit of six months to one year to repay. The two banks have allocated 400,000 yuan specifically for this loan. The amount borrowed by small vendors shall not exceed 30 yuan per person, while shopkeepers and landlords can borrow 300 yuan to purchase equipment.</p>
<p>Drafting an Ultimatum</p>
<p>[London, 28th Dispatch from the Associated Press] Martin, an advisor to the British Foreign Office, is currently drafting a strong ultimatum refusing to recognize Japan's right to block the coast in China and refuting Japan's claim to control all concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, and Bangkok, Siam. The note will urge Japan to pay attention to Britain's treaty rights and resolutely reject all of Japan's claims.</p>
<p>British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, stated to the British government yesterday that the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs openly declared that it would use force against all countries to protect Japan's "rights." The Japanese government should be responsible for this threatening language.</p>
<p>Because the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom gave a speech on Thursday satirizing the current attitude of democratic countries as being strong in appearance but weak in reality, and with the British-Soviet alliance about to be completed, the relationship between Britain and the Axis countries has obviously cooled.</p>
<p>British Press Commentary</p>
<p>[London, 18th Dispatch from Reuters] The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times declared today that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, Nobel, had previously protested to the Japanese authorities about the Gulangyu incident. If a satisfactory reply is not received, a strong response will be given to the Japanese naval blockade of Gulangyu in the next few days. The Gulangyu incident is the most important test action. Japan is in fact illegally demanding the rights of belligerent countries without recognizing the state of war. If the state of war does not actually exist, then Japan has no legal basis to demand the rights of belligerent countries. If Japan's interference in British interests in public concessions becomes more serious, Britain's most obvious retaliatory weapon is to punish trade with Japan. This weapon is most feared by Japan because without British, French, and American trade, Japan will not be able to continue the war.</p>
<p>[London, 27th Dispatch from Reuters] The Times here commented this morning on the recent tension between Japan and countries such as Britain and France due to the Chinese coast incident (referring to difficulties with British and French ships). Japan's high-pressure tactics outside Hong Kong and the Gulangyu incident are directly related. The Japanese naval authorities launched an illegal raid on Gulangyu, and not getting their wish, they were angered and took this action. Some people expect that Japan may take new actions before the incident is resolved. Japan's oppression of foreigners in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places and its failure to abide by its past promises to respect foreign rights have caused significant inconvenience to foreigners. However, Japan may soon reconsider its policies towards countries related to China. It is not impossible. Facts have proven that it is inappropriate for Japan to destroy China, and it is also wrong to use cunning tricks to exclude the interests of countries such as Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Assembly: Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Lian County, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The Guangdong Provisional Provincial Assembly opened on the 15th, with 37 assembly members present. A total of 78 proposals were submitted and discussed in ten meetings. On the 27th, after the discussion was completed, Zhu Nianci, Liang Naixian, and nine others were elected as resident assembly members and issued a declaration, sending a telegram to comfort compatriots overseas on the battlefield. The assembly closed on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Shanxi and Shaanxi: Sudden Abundance of Rain</h3>
<p>[Xingji, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Since the beginning of this year, Shanxi and Shaanxi have suffered from severe drought for several months. On the 27th, there was a sudden downpour, allowing for the complete harvest of wheat fields and the planting of autumn seedlings.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle Northeast of Wuchuan: 3,000 Troops from Enemy and Puppet Forces Surrounded Us on Multiple Routes; After Blocking by Our Main Forces, Many Enemy Troops Were Annihilated</h3>
<p>[Hequ, 27th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] About 3,000 troops from the enemy and puppet forces, with 10 artillery pieces and 40 vehicles, recently attempted to encircle us on four routes. On the 19th, our main force engaged in a bloody battle with them in the area northeast of Wuchuan, which was extremely fierce. One unit of our forces engaged in several hand-to-hand combats with the enemy in the Wai Dong area to seize strongholds, killing more than 50 enemy soldiers and finally defeating them. Another unit of our forces engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's third route at Changshun Shui Xing for about an hour, killing about 200 enemy soldiers. They are still fighting northeast of Wuchuan.</p>
<p>[Xinghua, 26th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] More than 100 enemy soldiers in Funing attacked Sanjie沟 on the morning of the 25th, and were intercepted and attacked on both sides by the Republic Army, killing more than 40 enemy soldiers. The enemy, unable to withstand, retreated. Subsequently, more than 200 soldiers were transferred to commit disturbances. Two enemy ships sailed to Sheyanghe and landed more than 100 naval soldiers at Wufang Port. They encountered our militia at the same time, and the artillery fire was fierce. After six hours of fierce fighting, our militia withdrew safely.</p>
<p>[Xingji, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] On the night of the 24th, our army advanced to the Pingyuan Shiwan area of Zhaocheng, destroyed several sections of the railway, and then ambushed in separate groups. Soon, a train from the enemy heading south arrived at the damaged section of Shiwan, and the enemy soldiers got off the train to repair the road. Our ambushing soldiers fired simultaneously, and after an hour of fierce fighting, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed. The rest, unable to withstand, boarded the train in panic and fled north.</p>
<p>[Xingji, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] More than 400 enemy soldiers entrenched in Jingxiang Town, west of Fenxi, attacked Kecheng Town (southwest of Jingxiang) via Quantou on the 24th. Our army ambushed and attacked near Pangjialing, and one unit flanked from the high ground in the northeast. After four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and fled back to Jingxiang Town, leaving more than 50 bodies behind.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission States: The Arrest of Chen Yi is Absolutely Not True</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Regarding the absurd statement released by the enemy's Tongmeng News Agency on the 26th that a copy of Chen Yi had been arrested by the Central Army, the reporter specifically inquired about the truth from the Military Affairs Commission. The spokesperson of the Commission solemnly clarified that there was no such thing. Then, Chen Chairman's telegram on the 27th was shown to show that the enemy was spreading rumors, which is a habitual trick. Chairman Chen is loyal and patriotic and has contributed greatly to national defense. The enemy has repeatedly tried to create disturbances but has not succeeded, so they made this rumor in an attempt to slander him. The fact is the same as the Tokyo broadcast on the 16th of this month that the chief of staff of our 31st Division was captured near Xinheji. They are both unfounded because our 31st Division did not participate in this battle at all. How could the enemy capture its chief of staff? The reason for this mystery is to cover up the fact that the chief of staff of the rest of the Jiangxi divisions was captured by us.</p>
<h3>Returning from Inspecting the Guerrilla Areas in Southern Jiangsu: Zhou Enlai Talks About the New Situation (Part 2); Organizing the Masses Behind Enemy Lines to Launch a People's War; Transforming the Rear into the Front to Defeat Economic Conspiracies</h3>
<p>Economic Aggression. According to Zhou, the Japanese side's plan to clear the rear has five points: (1) To impose an economic blockade on us; (2) To conduct economic warfare against us; (3) To plunder our coal, iron, cotton, salt, tea, rice, and other products in order to enrich Japan's resources and turn these raw materials into Japanese goods for dumping in China; (4) To develop the transportation lines in North China; (5) To build ports. At the beginning of the war, Japan originally intended to blockade our country, but as of today, it wants to engage in trade with us. At the beginning of the war, it originally intended to destroy all of our industries, but as of today, it is trying to rebuild industries in our occupied areas. It is also quite unfavorable for Japan's international payments to encourage exports in one direction. As for Japan's plan to obtain raw materials in the occupied areas, it has been very unsuccessful. For example, the Japanese attempted to obtain 10 million tons of coal in North China, but only managed to collect 1 million tons. Furthermore, the problem of economic development is fundamentally impossible because this point must be controlled militarily behind the Japanese army. Therefore, initially, it took 1.4 yuan of legal tender to exchange for 1 yuan of puppet currency, but as of now, this exchange rate has been reversed. As for their plan to build harbors, it was planned long ago, but has not yet started.</p>
<p>Our Countermeasures. Zhou continued to talk about the outlines of our response to the Japanese side's plan, saying, "We recognize that there are many weaknesses, such as not being able to completely economically blockade Japan, not being able to fiercely resist Japanese goods, and not being able to completely destroy various factories before falling into enemy hands. At the same time, Japanese goods can still flow into our country." Zhou continued, "We must completely blockade the coastal areas, even if the people there feel inconvenienced. Our purpose is to make the Chinese people self-sufficient, so we must continue to carry out destruction work in the occupied areas, especially on railways, highways, and various industries used by the Japanese.</p>
<p>People's War. We have organized the majority of the masses to destroy Japanese transportation lines and preserve Chinese resources in the Japanese rear. At the same time, we will make the people in remote areas understand the meaning of this war of resistance against Japan. The reason why the Japanese army has been able to achieve some success in China is mostly due to our own weaknesses, not entirely due to the strength of the Japanese army. For example, we have some troops that are not familiar with guerrilla tactics, so they have not been able to fully fulfill the mission of attacking the Japanese. At the same time, the cooperation of the masses has not been fully satisfactory, so many places have fallen, which is said to be due to the Japanese conquest, but I would rather say it is due to our voluntary abandonment. As of now, the masses have mostly been organized, and they are all enthusiastic about breaking the Japanese plan to use our country's manpower and porcelain resources to conquer China. Therefore, the war of resistance behind the Japanese army is a full-scale war of organized masses against the Japanese, not just the guerrilla warfare of the guerrillas. At the same time, on the front, when the enemy is moving toward a certain side, we will also launch counterattacks on many sides. Furthermore, we will continue to train new troops in the rear to prepare for the final blow to achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>On the New Stage. Zhou also said, "In this new stage of the war of resistance, the Japanese army can still achieve small victories, but there is no possibility of achieving great victories. It is difficult to predict where the Japanese will attack next, but what is known is that they must attack where they can obtain the greatest final benefit, that is, attacking our weaknesses and unpreparedness. For example, the recent battle of Nanchang is an example. In addition, our railways and other transportation lines are also among their attack objectives. Roughly, the direction of this Japanese attack will depend on the changes in the European situation. If Britain and France have problems in Europe, the Japanese will continue to advance southwest; otherwise, they will advance north. In short, their purpose is to eliminate foreign interests in China."</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens and Opium Dens in Western Shanghai: Expanding to the Concessions; One on Yu Yuan Road Has Political Implications; All Under the Protection of the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] In the "badlands" of the Extra-Settlement Roads area, gambling dens under the protection of the Japanese have begun to expand into the Public Concession in recent weeks. There are three newly established gambling dens, two on Haig Road and one at No. 65 Gordon Road, the Asia Club. The gambling den near No. 368 Haig Road is operated by Chinese who run "Hollywood Paradise." Another one at the corner of Haig Road and Route Tenant de la Tour is of an independent nature. In addition, there are about 20 gambling dens in Route des Soeurs, Connaught Road, Brenan Road, Rue Ferguson, and in a village in the Extra-Settlement Roads area. The new gambling den on Gordon Road, entirely within the Public Concession, is said to be the most profitable, earning as much as 40,000 gold in one night. These gambling dens are all operated by Chinese who have close ties with the Japanese Military Special Services Department and receive its protection. The Gordon Road and Haig Road gambling dens are financed by a Cantonese man named Wang, a shareholder of Hollywood Paradise. The gambling den at the corner of Haig Road and Route Tenant de la Tour is established by a man named Li and managed by a man named Liu, who is said to be a Taiwanese. The Japanese Military Special Services Department, which guarantees the protection of these gambling dens, has an office near the corner of Route des Soeurs and Route Kaufmann, headed by a Japanese man named Jieye. There is one Japanese man in charge of accounting in the Gordon Road gambling den, and half of the profits must be handed over to the Japanese side. It is unknown whether other gambling dens pay protection fees to the Japanese Military Special Services Department. The Japanese not only guarantee that the Chinese operating the gambling dens will not be interfered with by the police of the Public Concession, but also guarantee that gamblers will not be arrested or interfered with when returning home after curfew. Since the Japanese army occupied the Shanghai area, the evils that came with it are not limited to gambling dens. A newspaper supplement has published the names of 34 opium dens, all located outside the jurisdiction of the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is said that these opium dens all have licenses issued by the Japanese Military Special Services Department and pay a monthly fee of 600 yuan. In the past week, four more opium dens have been opened. The development of these evils in the Extra-Settlement Roads area and their spread into the Public Concession will naturally have a negative impact on the Concession.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Recently, many new gambling dens have been established in the Extra-Settlement Roads area of western Shanghai, harming the people more than floods or fierce beasts. The house at No. 864 Yu Yuan Road has been brewing the organization of a large-scale gambling den for a long time. Because it has not obtained the understanding of a certain party, preparations were once temporarily suspended. Recently, a certain party member came forward to preside over it and announced its realization. The participants in the organization are extremely complex, and its content is political in nature. However, its gambling part harms society, just like other gambling dens. The Concession authorities are now observing its development in order to take appropriate measures and severely crack down on it.</p>
<h3>× Armies Forcefully Occupy, Eastern Sui Situation Deteriorates, Commerce and Finance Completely Controlled by × Forces, × Propaganda Purely Castles in the Air, Report of Inspection by Shanghai News Reporter</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] According to a Zhangjiakou dispatch in the North-China Daily News, in February, a group of foreign reporters, under the guidance of Japanese officials, toured Guihua in Suiyuan. According to news collected from various newspapers, after these reporters returned, they enthusiastically wrote about their pleasant experiences traveling in Inner Mongolia, almost portraying it as a second paradise. They claimed the area was peaceful and vast, trade was prosperous, local industry was developed, and the people were extremely happy and content. The reporter is well aware that the situation there is similar to Zhangjiakou, and these optimistic reports greatly surprised the reporter. Therefore, not long ago, driven by curiosity, the reporter went to Guihua and other towns for a few weeks and returned greatly disappointed, unable to understand the basis for such optimistic reports. Based on the reporter's observations:</p>
<p>The situation in Inner Mongolia is not only not optimistic, but actually worse than before the Japanese invasion. The prosperous export trade that Guihua once relied on has now completely ceased. The reason for this is twofold. First, the caravan route that started from Ganzhou and extended to southwestern Xinjiang has been completely cut off. The Chinese army's front line is only a few miles west of Baotou, the final station of the Ping-Sui Railway. In the past, long lines of camels slowly traveled along this ancient caravan route, at a pace of two and a half miles per hour, carrying leather, wool, and other products from western Suiyuan. Not to mention the highly profitable opium caravans, all of this has stopped. Now, no caravans arrive in Baotou or Guihua. Second, in the northern Mongolian plains,</p>
<p>Bandits run rampant as before. Therefore, Chinese merchants who used to frequently go to Mongolia to collect and purchase products no longer risk venturing into these areas. In reality, the areas inhabited by the people have been devastated. Many villages are deserted, and the people are suffering terribly from poverty. Much of the cultivated land has now reverted to pasture. In other respects, the Mongolians themselves no longer bring their goods to the railway towns for sale, fearing that they will be forced to sell them at the officially set low prices. The only remaining export trade must go through the Mengzang Company. This company is nominally a joint venture of six Mongolian firms, but in reality, it is entirely under</p>
<p>Japanese control, completely and absolutely monopolizing all export products. Outsiders, unless they obtain special permission, are not allowed to buy or sell wool, leather, or any other common export items. When the reporter was in Guihua, several German merchants also arrived there. Although they obtained special permission from the Japanese, they encountered great difficulties in managing to purchase even the smallest amount of what they needed, and they left with great dissatisfaction. In short, the authorities have made it clear that they do not welcome the participation of outsiders, and they use various means to prevent outsiders from entering. To stay in Inner Mongolia for a slightly longer period, one must obtain a special permit issued by the Japanese military authorities, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain such permits. Soon after the establishment of the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," the new Mengzang banknotes were put into circulation, but no one trusts them. Although foreign exchange is strictly restricted and all imports and exports are controlled, the exchange rate between Mengzang currency and legal tender is very unfavorable. As a result, prices of all goods have doubled in the past year and a half, but this has not compensated for the increased cost of living. The local retail trade is still as good as before, but most customers, apart from those who sell daily necessities, are Japanese soldiers and civilians. In the past, wealthy Mongolian men and women would flock to Guihua every year to shop, crowding the streets, but this is no longer seen. The so-called "foreign goods stores" that they especially liked to patronize have now become "luxury goods" display centers with little business. Opium is heavily planted in the surrounding countryside. It is said that opium is planted in more than one-tenth of the fields. This is probably because the supply of opium, which was usually transported by caravans, has been cut off.</p>
<p>The political situation does not seem to be more pleasant than the commercial and financial situation. Mongolians and Japanese are quite distrustful of each other. Although the Mongolian government is nominally autonomous, it is actually controlled by Japanese advisors. Recently, it has even been manipulated by representatives of the Japanese army. Mongolian princes know very well that they are in a subordinate position and are very indecisive, but they are powerless to do anything about it. The several thousand Mongolian soldiers recruited to fight against the Chinese army and suppress bandits, the so-called "Inner Mongolia Army," are extremely bad. They have no discipline, let alone combat capability. The Japanese themselves do not trust them. These Mongolian soldiers are often sent out to suppress bandits, but they loot villages and commit the most terrible atrocities. Therefore, the people hate them to the bone, even more than the Japanese army. Because of the uselessness of the Mongolian army, Chinese regular troops often attack the cities of Suiyuan, directly approaching the city walls without any losses. Occasionally, when the Chinese army waits for the × forces to approach, the Mongolian army, seeing the situation as serious, flees elsewhere. Because both the Japanese and the Mongolians are dissatisfied, when the reporter was in Guihua, both sides were quite tense. Rumors abounded throughout the city, some saying that the "Mongolian Military Government" was about to move elsewhere, and that the nominal head, Prince De, had already been dismissed; others saying that the "Autonomous Government" would be completely abolished and the area would be directly ruled by the Japanese army. Whether these rumors will become reality remains to be seen in the future, but some changes may be unavoidable soon. In terms of the welfare of the common people of Inner Mongolia, the current regime has certainly not improved the areas it governs. In fact, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the situation there is worse than in early 1937,</p>
<p>Significantly deteriorated. In short, there are three reasons for this: (1) Poor handling of general financial and economic affairs. (2) The deep hatred of the Chinese, who account for nine-tenths of the population, towards the Japanese occupation is as strong as ever. (3) The Japanese have failed to win the friendship and cooperation of the Mongolians.</p>

<h3>Soviet-French Proposal Draft, Soviet Union to Reply Soon, Observers Believe It is Acceptable, Agreement Principle is to Promote Mutual Assistance</h3>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 27th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, visited the Soviet Foreign Ministry today and had a secret conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for over an hour, and presented the British and French proposals for a tripartite mutual assistance pact. The Soviet government is now studying the British and French proposals and will reply soon. It is widely believed that if agreed upon, the pact will be signed in Moscow.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 28th] At 4 PM yesterday, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and presented the British memorandum on the issue of the Anglo-Soviet agreement.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 28th] Yesterday afternoon, the French chargé d'affaires also accompanied the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union during his visit to the Soviet Foreign Minister and presented a memorandum. It is said that the contents of the document are largely the same as the British memorandum. Subsequently, the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union held a one-hour discussion with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin. As to the outcome, all four remained silent, so it is unknown. As of now, Molotov's personal views on these two documents and whether the Soviet government will accept the British and French proposals are still unknown. According to diplomatic circles, Molotov has made no comments because he must first consult Stalin before replying.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] The French government approved yesterday the French Foreign Minister's negotiations on the tripartite agreement and the full text of the memorandum submitted to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th] The draft of the British, French, and Soviet tripartite mutual assistance agreement jointly proposed by the British and French governments has been commented on by various observers, who all believe that it is in line with the original proposal and is acceptable. The key points of the British and French draft are twofold: (1) If any signatory is attacked, the other signatories will automatically provide assistance. This is a further step compared to the current Franco-Soviet agreement, which requires the League of Nations Council to determine that an aggression has indeed occurred before mutual assistance is implemented. The mutual assistance agreement drafted by the UK, France, and the Soviet Union focuses on promoting the principle of mutual assistance in order to contribute to the general peace situation and is consistent with the basic principles of the League of Nations Covenant. This shows that the League of Nations has not been abandoned. (2) Which countries will need the assistance of the UK, France, and the Soviet Union in the future? The British and French draft does not specify. According to this, Poland and Romania are included in the guaranteed countries, as are the Baltic coastal countries: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. British and French sources here say that all these points should satisfy the Soviet Union, but details may still need to be discussed. In short, the formation of an alliance between the Soviet Union and the old capitalist countries is a refreshing sight for the world. However, it is not appropriate to make any definite predictions before the outcome of the negotiations is determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Britain may send a military mission to Moscow to hold talks with Soviet General Staff officers. France will also take similar action so that the three countries can conduct a thorough study of anti-aggression defense issues. According to unconfirmed reports from German sources here, once the peace front is established, Britain will diplomatically offer Hitler an opportunity to negotiate with various countries in order to resolve Germany's own difficulties. There are even widespread rumors that Britain is considering convening a European peace conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that after the UK, France, and the Soviet Union establish a mutual assistance agreement, Germany and Italy may draw Japan into signing a military alliance and invite Spain and Hungary to join as a retaliatory measure. If this move materializes, it will have two effects: (1) After the German-Italian alliance is expanded, some small European countries located between the democracies and the totalitarian states will have to make a choice. (2) After the strength of the two major blocs is clearly visible, the UK, France, Germany, and Italy may hold a meeting to find ways to resolve various important pending issues. In addition, the current tense situation may gradually tire the UK and France, leading them to accept the demands of the totalitarian states.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses, German Annexation of Czech Issue, All Parties Advocate Non-Recognition</h3>
<p>[London, 27th Radio] Yesterday, before adjourning for the "Christmas Advent" recess, the House of Commons discussed two important issues: one was the possibility of the British government recognizing Germany's occupation of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. Labor MP Alexander initiated the debate that day, stating, "Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement did not explicitly guarantee that he would not recognize the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia before consulting with Parliament. The opposition party is extremely concerned about this point. I will ask the government to clearly announce that it will not take such action in the future. I recall that on March 22, the British Foreign Secretary stated that the British government had protested against Germany's military actions and the changes they caused, saying that they had no legal basis. On March 17, the Prime Minister also expressed his anger in a speech in Birmingham. The opposition party strongly supports the Prime Minister's position, so it believes that the government should not consider the issue of recognition." Liberal MP Sir Sinclair mentioned the issue of the protection of Eastern European countries, stating, "If this policy is to succeed, it requires extraordinary national effort. What is most noteworthy is that the French government has refused to appoint a consul to Slovakia, while the British government has decided to send a consul to Bratislava. The French government has not yet expressed its agreement. Although I acknowledge that Slovakia has an independent government, that government is in fact a puppet organization controlled by Germany, so I also oppose sending a consul. The situation in establishing a consulate in Prague is different because we must apply for a "consular certificate" from Berlin. What I hope is that no matter what method the government takes to protect our interests in Prague, we must not have the slightest suspicion of recognizing Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic." Conservative MP Bossom also stated, "Recognizing Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic is an unthinkable thing." Conservative MP Brasswaite, while agreeing to postpone the period of recognition, still felt that permanent postponement was also difficult unless the countries could use force to restore the situation before the annexation.</p>
<h3>Yankee Clipper Completes First Official Flight</h3>
<p>[Port Washington, 27th] The "Yankee Clipper" has now completed its first official voyage, carrying mail and crossing the Atlantic, arriving here today. The aircraft took off from Southampton on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] 27-year-old aviator Thomas Smith departed from Waters, Maine at 3:47 PM today to fly across the Atlantic.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Fishes, Hitler Vacations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Today is the first day of the Christmas holiday. The weather here is clear, and citizens are traveling by car. Prime Minister Chamberlain returned here from Edinburgh last night and left here again today for fishing in southern England, taking a short trip of a few days. Queen Mary's injuries continue to improve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th] Hitler has gone to Berchtesgaden for his holiday.</p>
<h3>British Navy Prepares to Safeguard Far East Interests, Australian Fleet Cooperates with Britain, Netherlands to Strengthen East Indies Strength</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 27th] Australian Federal Defense Minister Street told the press today that the British Admiralty has drawn up a complete plan. When necessary, the Singapore naval base will station a full fleet, including battleships, to protect British interests in the Far East. The Australian government has guaranteed that Australia's defense strength, including the navy, will fully cooperate with the British fleet stationed in Singapore and the fleet stationed in China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, The Hague, 28th] The Dutch government will submit a shipbuilding bill to Congress, stipulating the construction of at least three battlecruisers of 25,000 to 30,000 tons. Since the naval strength of various countries in the Pacific has been enhanced, the Netherlands also wants to increase the strength of its East Indies fleet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 27th] The Dutch Minister of Defense today ordered that the Dutch armed forces must be in a state of readiness to cope with any emergencies.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Production Plan Successful, Nearly a Thousand Aircraft Manufactured Monthly, Large Aircraft Factory to be Established in Scotland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Sunday Times reported that the production plan of the Aviation Department has been extremely successful, and the current production rate has reached what was expected at the end of last year. According to some responsible sources, the number of aircraft manufactured in Britain each month is close to one thousand. The newspaper also stated that it is not excessive or unattainable for Britain to estimate that it can manufacture 35,000 to 40,000 aircraft per year in wartime, because the Aviation Department can expand the aircraft manufacturing industry three or four times larger in wartime than in peacetime. Another good phenomenon is that the quality of Britain's new aircraft is extremely good. For example, the Hawker Hurricane is 20 miles per hour faster than the fastest German fighter, and the Spitfire, which is currently being produced in large quantities, is 35 miles per hour faster than the Hawker Hurricane.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] It is reported that the world's largest aircraft engine manufacturing plant will be established in Scotland. The plant is planned to be built in Glasgow. It will start work after Rolls-Royce's 4 million pound new plan is completed. The plant is scheduled to start construction next year and can employ about 3,000 workers. When fully increased in working efficiency, it will be able to accommodate 10,000 workers. A temporary factory has now been set up to start training workers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British Minister of Civil Defense Anderson stated in a speech in Glasgow today that more than one million civil defense personnel have been recruited, reaching the expected number. The enthusiasm of the public to enlist is no less than that in the months after the start of the last World War, but the allocation of personnel is still not appropriate. There are still some shortcomings to be remedied. He also stated that there are now a large number of sandbags and 50 million gas masks.</p>
<h3>Italian Volunteers in Spain to Withdraw by End of Month, Spain to Demobilize Another 50,000 Soldiers, France on Alert on Moroccan Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 27th] According to the Italian newspaper, the date for Italian volunteers in Spain to leave Spain and return to Italy has now been postponed to May 31. Except for some aircraft that will be brought back to Italy in early June, all other military equipment will not be brought back. A farewell ceremony will be held when the Italian air force leaves Spain, and some Spanish officers will participate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Burgos, 28th] Spanish Nationalist leader Franco has ordered the demobilization of another 50,000 soldiers at the end of this month. Including this batch, a total of 250,000 soldiers have been disbanded after the end of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Moroccan authorities have recently ordered a ban on aircraft flying and the use of cameras in a large area along the Spanish-Moroccan border.</p>
<h3>German Reserves Regularly Trained, Forced to Join Nazi Organizations, Italy to Set Up General Staff in Turin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] The German government has now officially announced an important decree that will enable German reserve personnel to receive regular training. According to the details of the decree, the German government will force all conscripts to join an organization similar to the Nazi stormtroopers so that they can stay in training. In addition to being forced to be conscripted, each person must undergo at least ten time units of training in each training period. At the same time as this announcement, what is sufficient to increase the practical significance of this matter is that the Nazi stormtroopers' battalions will be incorporated into the German armed forces. According to the instructions issued by Stormtroopers leader Viktor Lutze, special stormtroopers defense teams are about to be organized and will receive the same training as regular troops. Those who have completed their reserve service will be transferred to these teams. Therefore, this kind of political organization that has changed from combat operations to a political-military organization, with hundreds of thousands of people, is truly a huge increase in Germany's military strength.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 27th] After inspecting the Italian Western fortresses, Mussolini has ordered the establishment of a special general staff for border defense in Turin, and commissioned Lieutenant General Micchi to preside over it. Lieutenant General Micchi served in the European War and the Abyssinian War.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 28th] After discussing the cooperation between the German and Italian air forces with the Italian air force commanders, the German Deputy Minister of Aviation left here yesterday to return to his country.</p>
<h3>British Philanthropist Donates 1.5 Million Pounds to Improve Military Recreation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The famous British philanthropist Lord Nuffield has entrusted his trustees with a large sum of 1.5 million pounds specifically for improving the sports and recreation of the British security forces, local army, and other troops. Nuffield has written to the Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, to notify him of this move, and the Secretary of State for War has replied, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the troops. The donation will generate an annual interest of 105,000 pounds.</p>
<h3>"Iron Lung Man" Attends Mass in Lourdes, Priest Prays for Him</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lourdes, 27th] "Iron Lung Man" Schnitzer arrived here to attend Mass and was carried to the holy pool today. He requested to bathe so that his old illness could be cured. However, in reality, he could not bathe, so he only washed his head with water from the holy pool. The priest held a special prayer, blessing Schnitzer and his family. Schnitzer lay in the iron lung with a large clock in front of him to see the prayer ceremony.</p>
<h3>Davis Arrives in England and will Proceed to Paris to Understand the European Situation</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] American politician Davis, commonly regarded as President Roosevelt's special representative, recently arrived here, arousing considerable attention from the public. It is said that Mr. Davis will remain until next Monday before going to Paris. His trip is to understand the European situation on the ground and it is said to be undertaken at the behest of President Roosevelt. After the Pentecost holiday, the newly appointed British Ambassador to the United States, Marquess of Lothian, will host a banquet for Mr. Davis.</p>
<h3>US Submarine Disaster Still Under Rescue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Portsmouth, 27th] US naval officials announced today that 60 divers are still working day and night to float the "Squalus" submarine and recover the remains of 26 victims. This will not be completed for one to two weeks.</p>
<h3>King Annam Flies to Marseilles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 28th] The King of Annam flew to Marseilles on a French plane today.</p>
<h3>US Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to Hold Meetings Separately to Discuss Amending Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, Secretary of State Hull's proposal has been commented on by various observers, saying that Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Iowa, and Senator Pittman, a Democrat from Nevada (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee), had previously proposed amendments to the Neutrality Act. The former advocated authorizing the President to declare the existence of a state of war and recognize the belligerents, demarcate dangerous areas, and prohibit American citizens from entering them, otherwise they would bear all risks. The latter advocated that the "cash and carry" provision should apply uniformly to munitions and all other goods. Some points of these two proposals are approved by the government. What Secretary of State Hull has proposed now is a compromise plan. The Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees will therefore hold separate meetings within days to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Balkan Countries Economic Conference Held in Bucharest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 27th] The Seventh Economic Conference of the Balkan Entente countries opened today to discuss transportation, commerce, and aviation issues among the Balkans. After the meeting, a statement was issued, saying that since the last meeting, the Balkan Entente countries have made progress in these aspects, as well as in shipping and tourism.</p>
<h3>Schacht's Speech Sharply Criticized by Indian Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 27th] The Times of India here, in which Gandhi's son also participates, recently sharply criticized the speech by Dr. Schacht, former president of the German National Bank, on German-Indian cooperation, saying that India has expressed its disgust for the National Socialist methods and does not want to seek German political assistance. The Indian people are indeed seeking freedom, but they do not want the freedom obtained from British imperialism to be transferred to the oppression of National Socialist dictatorship.</p>
<h3>Speech by French Foreign Minister Bonnet: England and France Have Become One; Efforts to Establish a Peace Front; Soviet Union Denies Military Agreement with Turkey</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] Foreign Minister Bonnet, in a speech delivered at the State Council yesterday, stated that England and France have now become one. In addition to implementing conscription, England has also offered guarantees to several countries. France recognizes that peace is the most precious of all blessings, and peaceful consultation between nations is most necessary. However, if any nation attempts to impose its will upon France, the French people will undoubtedly respond to the nation's call and make the greatest sacrifices, as they did in 1914. It is reported that at yesterday's State Council meeting, the Foreign Minister presented a review of the international situation, stating that the current situation is better than before. However, the French government cannot relax its efforts to establish a democratic peace front. The Foreign Minister also mentioned that England, France, and the Soviet Union may soon announce the establishment of an agreement, and that the Anglo-Turkish agreement may also be signed soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 28th] Regarding rumors that a Soviet-Turkish military agreement has indeed been signed a week ago, TASS, based on reliable information, officially declares that this news is completely untrue. No military agreement has been signed between Turkey and the Soviet Union, nor does such an agreement exist at present.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 27th] Rumors that the Soviet government invited Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to Moscow to discuss the Soviet Union supplying Poland with military equipment and the construction of railways between the two countries have been denied by responsible officials here. Political figures stated that Poland is willing to maintain friendly relations with all its neighbors, and therefore, relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have indeed made smooth progress recently.</p>
<p>Polish Cabinet to Request Full Powers for the President from Parliament</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 28th] The Polish cabinet will submit a bill to parliament granting the government full powers. The bill stipulates that the president can declare a state of war without obtaining the parliament's permission. At the same time, the commander-in-chief of the national army has complete and independent authority over all operational actions. If the bill is passed, the Polish government will become a military dictatorship in the event of war. The bill states that Poland, in view of the current situation, must prepare for war spiritually, materially, and legally. Once war breaks out, all civilian government agencies will be under the jurisdiction of the military authorities, and all civil rights will be suspended.</p>
<h3>The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East</h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>Now, let us discuss the concrete progress of the cooperation and negotiations between England and the Soviet Union over the past two months. Generally, it can be divided into three stages. After the fall of Czechoslovakia, the British and French authorities immediately began to contact the Soviet Union, expressing their willingness to jointly resist further aggression. The Soviet Union's response, however, was the somewhat vague idea of rebuilding "collective security." This was the first step. Frankly speaking, the Soviet Union at that time doubted the sincerity of England and France. Then, Romania and Poland were threatened. To show sincerity, England first guaranteed the independence of Poland and Romania. When England and France turned to the Soviet Union again to seek cooperation in Europe, the Soviet Union then put forward further specific suggestions, namely, that this cooperation should include the Far East. This was the second stage. At this time, President Roosevelt intervened, and the US Navy was redeployed to the Pacific. The illusion that England could separate Japan from the aggressive bloc was revived. The British ambassador to Japan became unusually active, and negotiations with the Soviet Union temporarily came to a standstill. However, soon after, Hitler's speech revoked the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and the situation in Europe became tense again. The negotiations between England and the Soviet Union entered the third stage. This time, England's focus was no longer on cooperation, but simply on asking: (1) If England and France were to be drawn into war to fulfill their guarantees to Romania and Poland, would the Soviet Union help? (2) Could the Soviet Union provide the same guarantees to Romania and Poland? The Soviet Union's answer was: (1) There should be a more definite mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union, England, France, and Poland. (2) The scope of the guarantee should extend from the northernmost countries of Eastern Europe all the way to the Balkans, and should also include Western countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Relief for Out-of-School Refugee Children</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Relief Association has established Chinese Line schools in Hong Kong and Macau to provide relief to out-of-school refugee children. Enrollment registration has been taking place in various districts since the 22nd of this month. As of the 27th, the number of applicants has reached 3,000, exceeding the association's planned quota by as much as two-thirds. This shows that the problem of providing relief to refugee children will remain serious in the future. This is something that people who care about society and public welfare cannot ignore. We hope that leaders from all walks of life will at least strive to achieve the following:</p>
<p>First, a larger-scale enrollment registration should be held so that all out-of-school refugee children in Hong Kong and Macau can register and be properly documented. Second, the registration of unemployed teachers can be expanded simultaneously, and methods for providing relief, organizing, and training these teachers should be discussed promptly. Third, at the same time, promote publicity for the relief of out-of-school children, and launch a unified and widespread fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>To achieve the above steps, on the one hand, guidance and assistance should be obtained from the relevant authorities in the motherland, and on the other hand, the sympathy and assistance of influential figures in Hong Kong and Macau should be sought. In addition, relief for out-of-school refugee children cannot be satisfied merely by providing them with educational opportunities. We must also be concerned about the actual living conditions of the refugee children, and whether the educational organization and training they receive are adapted to the needs of national reconstruction. To increase the efficiency of national reconstruction education and quickly eliminate illiteracy, we should also consider using the new educational tool of the Latinized New Script, and should also vigorously promote the "little teacher" system and realize life education. We must enable these refugee children to work and study hard under the threat of artillery fire, so that they can become a vital force to support national salvation and carry out national reconstruction work in the future.</p>

<h3>Observatory Hoists Typhoon Signal No. 7; Typhoon Approaches Hong Kong from the Northeast; Flights and Ships Suspended, Vessels Seek Shelter; Fire Department and Police Department Prepare for Accidents; Latest Report: Typhoon May Not Hit Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The weather in Hong Kong has been unusually fluctuating recently. Experienced boatmen familiar with astronomy have already predicted that this is a sign of a typhoon approaching Hong Kong. As expected, the Hong Kong Observatory received a telegram from Little Luzon yesterday morning stating that a typhoon has been discovered in the South China Sea and appears to be heading towards Hong Kong. Therefore, Typhoon Signal No. 1 was hoisted at 10:15 AM yesterday morning to give a warning. At that time, the typhoon was located between 124 degrees East longitude and 19 degrees North latitude (approximately south of Taiwan and east of the Dongsha Islands), with unpredictable wind direction.</p>
<p>Typhoon Set to Approach Hong Kong from the Northeast; Yesterday afternoon, the Observatory received another telegram from Little Luzon stating that the typhoon has now reached 20 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude, within a radius of 30 miles (approximately southeast of Hong Kong), heading northeast and north. Therefore, Typhoon Signal No. 7 was changed to be hoisted at 4:30 PM, indicating that the typhoon will approach Hong Kong from the northeast.</p>
<p>Vessels at Sea Seek Shelter; After changing to Typhoon Signal No. 7, the typhoon has entered within a 100-mile radius of Hong Kong. Therefore, the sea suddenly became turbulent. All sizes of cargo boats ended their work one after another, hiring small launches to tow them into typhoon shelters. Coastal vessels and residents along the seaside also made various preparations. At dusk, "wind lamps" shone green and white all around, with roaring waves and sparse mast lights, creating a bleak scene. According to observers, if the wind direction does not change, the eastern part of Hong Kong will be slightly affected. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's "Soochow" and Jardine Matheson's "Mingsheng" both turned back halfway.</p>
<p>Fire and Police Departments Prepare to Respond; At the same time, various agencies, the Fire Department, and the Police Department, with the increasing pressure of the wind and the high possibility of an attack, immediately ordered all team members to be forbidden from leaving the station. The police department increased special police deployments to maintain public order, while the fire department took on all fire matters and various accidents.</p>
<p>Seaside Businesses Add Floodgates; At the same time, the situation on land also became tense. Businesses in Hong Kong and across the sea were prepared to respond to the typhoon's arrival. Many signs were tied down or immediately removed, and doors facing the wind were mostly closed tightly. Businesses and residents in coastal areas and low-lying areas were also busy setting up floodgates in front of their doors to prevent floods. Although there was still no rain at night, there were significantly fewer pedestrians on the streets. However, there were many people densely watching the tides along the coast.</p>
<p>Bleak Scenes at Swimming Beaches in Various Districts; At遊棚 in North Point, Seven Sisters, across from Lai Chi Kok, and Sai Wan, there were many swimmers every weekend and holiday. Yesterday morning, there was drizzling rain and a chilly wind, so there were fewer swimmers. After Typhoon Signals No. 1 and No. 7 were hoisted, even fewer swimmers dared to come. Swimmers already in the water also ran away. The various swimming pools, in view of the approaching typhoon, had already removed banners and electric lights, etc., to prevent accidents. By night, swimmers at the beaches had disappeared completely. In addition, the sampan race originally scheduled to be held by the South China Aquatic Arts Association yesterday was postponed to the 30th of this month due to rain.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Observatory Weather Report; At 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon, the Observatory reported that a mild anti-cyclone extended from the three northeastern provinces to the Pacific Ocean east of Japan. Also, at 2:00 PM, the typhoon was moving away from Hong Kong to the southwest and west, blowing to the north-northeast, threatening the coast between Hong Kong and Shantou. It is predicted that Hong Kong will have northeast winds today, mild at first, then turning into strong winds, cloudy with rain.</p>
<p>Latest News, May Not Hit; According to the Hong Kong Observatory's weather report, the typhoon is now located between 20 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude, with a force center of 30 miles in circumference, blowing north-northeast, about 200-300 miles away from Hong Kong. The Observatory hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 1 at 10:15 AM yesterday morning, and then changed to Typhoon Signal No. 7 at 4:30 PM at noon. The No. 7 wind lamp was still issued at night, and all ships had already sailed into the typhoon shelter for temporary shelter. Civil aviation flights were also delayed. According to the latest wind direction judgment, the typhoon may not hit Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>London Charity Bazaar; Famous Women in Hong Kong Currently Collecting Items</h3>
<p>The wife of the British Ambassador, Guo Taiqi, plans to hold a charity bazaar in London soon to raise funds to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees in the motherland. After consulting with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, Madame Chiang Kai-shek instructed the Hong Kong Women's Relief Association to collect items in Hong Kong to be sent to sell. The meeting decided to send letters in the names of Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling, Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi Soong Ai-ling, Madame Soong Tzu-wen Chang Yueh-yi, and Madame Liao Zhongkai He Xiangning, inviting various women's groups here to initiate an organization to collect items from people in all walks of life.</p>

<h3>More Than a Dozen Overseas Chinese Organizations Jointly Hold; National Spiritual Mobilization Oath Ceremony; Scheduled for June 3rd in Kowloon; Thousands of People Expected to Participate</h3>
<p>As the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, spirit is more important than military affairs. Therefore, our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, advocated the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement to concentrate the spiritual strength of the compatriots of the whole country. Since the promotion of this movement, it has been promoted uniformly throughout the country, and overseas Chinese compatriots have also responded enthusiastically. Some overseas Chinese groups and women's schools in Hong Kong have also held individual ceremonies one after another. It has been found that there are now more than a dozen groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and it is now scheduled to hold a joint spiritual mobilization movement in a certain square in Kowloon on June 3. Preparations are now in place, and national bodies that have not yet held a general mobilization will gradually join. It is expected that thousands of overseas Chinese will participate in the oath ceremony at that time. The oath will be administered by Du Qizhang, Chairman of the Kowloon All Circles Relief Association.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Foreign Trade; More Favorable Than Before; Cargo Volume Reached More Than 12 Million Yuan in the First Quarter of This Year</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invaded southern China and captured Guangzhou, land and sea transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been completely cut off. However, Hong Kong's foreign trade has been able to maintain its excellent position under these special circumstances, which is contrary to the general concerns of people who worried that Hong Kong's trade would be severely hit. The total volume of Hong Kong's cargo transportation in the first quarter of this year is actually better compared to the months before Guangzhou fell last year. The total trade volume of the first quarter of the past two years is recorded below to illustrate this point. The total value of export trade from May to August 1938 was 15,851,657.71 yuan, while the number from January to April this year was 17,058,192.24 yuan. The difference between the two quarters is 1,206,535.53 yuan. The total value of import trade from May to August last year was 21,711,292.22 yuan, while the total value of import trade in the first quarter of this year was 18,259,206.1 yuan. The export trade numbers for May, June, July, and August last year are as follows: 46,106,354 yuan, 36,985,819 yuan, 36,676,878 yuan, 38,747,520 yuan. The export trade numbers for January, February, March, and April this year are as follows: 40,164,153 yuan, 36,502,007 yuan, 43,860,742 yuan, 40,955,022 yuan. The total value of import trade in May, June, July, and August last year is as follows: 63,285,102 yuan, 57,535,190 yuan, 47,787,620 yuan, 48,500,5010 yuan. The total value of import trade in January, February, March, and April this year is as follows: 40,680,959 yuan, 36,824,830 yuan, 48,011,086 yuan, 57,075,186 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yang Yuanxun Succeeds as Principal; of Pui Ching Middle School; To Take Office Next Month</h3>
<p>The Pui Ching Middle School board of directors held a meeting at the St. Francis Hotel at 7:00 PM last night. Several dozen people attended, chaired by Ye Peichu. After the meeting, the selection committee introduced Chao Enci, Xu Zhenyang, and Yang Yuandong as candidates for the school's principal. The directors then voted, and as a result, Mr. Yang Yuandong was selected as the school's successor principal, and it was decided that he would begin his duties on June 1. Mr. Yang has a Master's degree in Education from Columbia University in the United States. He returned to China in 1912 and served as a Commissioner in Qiongzhou. He served as Principal of Pui Ching in 1914 and then resigned to serve as the General Manager of the Meihua Police Bureau of the Guangzhou Dongshan Manxin Association, engaging in publishing. When the War of Resistance broke out, he left Guangzhou and returned to farming, advocating rural education. The old students of Pui Ching held a welcome dinner for Mr. Yang and the directors at the Sincere Co. Man Yuan Restaurant last night.</p>
<h3>Henri Aland; Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>Henri Aland, a former senior staff member of the Hong Kong Hotel and the Gloucester Hotel, passed away at 4:30 PM yesterday due to illness at his residence on the third floor of No. 13, Cloud View Road, at the age of 67. The funeral will be held at 5:15 PM this afternoon, and he will be buried at the Happy Valley Cemetery.</p>
<h3>Cholera Outbreak Intensifies!</h3>
<p>Hong Kong has a dense population, and the spread of cholera is common every summer. This summer, the health authorities have been paying close attention to the occurrence of cholera and urging citizens to take precautions. However, eight cases of cholera have still appeared this week. The total number to date is 31, five of which were imported from other ports. The health authorities have decided to hold broadcasts in both Chinese and English in the short term to extensively launch the "Cholera" prevention campaign. In addition, Mr. Ho Kam-tong recently went to various refugee camps to explain the initial treatment methods.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Income Tax; Not Expected to be Collected Temporarily; Earliest is 1941; Progressive System to Ensure Fairness</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Tax Source Committee's report was submitted to the authorities for review at the Legislative Council meeting the other day. Of the various tax increases recommended by the committee to the government, the income tax item has attracted considerable attention from the public. According to news obtained by reporters from official sources, when the Hong Kong authorities implement income tax in the future, it will adopt a progressive system, with the lowest tax rate starting at 2% (taxing those with the lowest income) and the highest tax rate at 10% (taxing those with the highest income). The timing of the introduction of income tax has not yet been decided and is still awaiting investigation into whether the Hong Kong situation is suitable for this tax system, and then implemented. Therefore, at a minimum, it must wait until January 1, 1941, before it is possible to realize. To seek a fair fixed amount of income tax, there are two methods: (1) Increase the tax-free income amount. Those who exceed the fixed amount will be taxed at 10%. (2) Lower the tax-free income amount and set a standard tax rate, taxing at 5%. The implementation of the progressive system must be determined according to the taxpayer's family burden. Taxpayers can request the deduction of their personal expenses and other uses before determining the amount of tax to be levied. If the above first method is adopted, the standard levy amount is 10%, the tax-free income amount is set at 400 yuan per month, and the maximum amount for personal expenses is 200 yuan. Married individuals will increase this amount by 50 yuan per month for each child. If the above two methods are the basis, the tax difference between the highest income earners and the lowest income earners can also be expanded.</p>
<h3>Chinese Righteous School; Relief for Out-of-School Refugee Children; Registration is Enthusiastic, Reaching 3,000; Five More Registration Locations Added</h3>
<p>The Chinese Righteous School, sponsored by the Out-of-School Refugee Children Relief Committee, has begun to register refugee children in recent days. The number of participants has reached 3,000. In order to make the purpose and content of the school's righteous school clear to the refugee compatriots staying in Hong Kong, the association's authorities specially sent teachers to distribute the charter and explain it verbally. Various schools here also provided assistance. Recently, the number of registration locations has increased again. On the Kowloon side, there are Zhiyong Middle School, Guangda Primary School, and Mind University High School. On the Hong Kong side, there are Mingming School and the Second Righteous School of the New Society Chamber of Commerce. In addition, since the Provincial Relief Committee has allocated funds to the association in Hong Kong, there has been no fundraising activity here. We hope that enthusiastic people in society who wish to sponsor this initiative will send their donations to the Provincial Relief Committee. Yesterday (Sunday), the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Refugee Children Free School" held a flower sale to raise funds. Many people in society did not understand and mistakenly believed that it was organized by the association, and inquired about the inside story. According to Mr. Tan Boyang, the person in charge, the Chinese Righteous School organized by the association is handled with funds allocated by the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee and does not require holding flower sales to raise funds or solicit donations from outside. It has been found that the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Refugee Children Free School" selling flowers to raise funds yesterday is actually another organization.</p>
<h3>Second Public Housing Estate</h3>
<p>Currently Under Construction for Several Months and Near Completion</p>
<p>To provide relief to the poor, the Hong Kong government previously constructed a public housing estate in Ma Tau Chung. The first building with forty units has been completed and opened. Forty households who passed the examination by the Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Committee have moved in. However, more than 300 households have applied for admission, but all were not admitted because they were full. Seeing this, the authorities are now speeding up the construction of the second building nearby. The project has been underway for more than a month. If there are no special delays, it will be completed in a few months and will continue to accommodate people. Those who want to apply for admission can obtain a registration form from various overseas Chinese groups and apply for admission. In addition, the Hong Kong Homeless Relief Association has closed all its dormitories. The executives felt that it would be a pity to leave them empty in the summer, so they wanted to use them to accommodate the poor, but this plan is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Blackout Drill; Planned to be Held at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong air defense authorities are currently preparing to hold a blackout drill, but the date has not yet been decided. According to Air Defense Controller Steele-Perkins, speaking to reporters yesterday, the blackout drill will not be held this month. The Air Defense Bureau plans to hold another blackout drill at the end of next month.</p>

<h3>Today's Happy Valley Horse Racing Starts at 12:30 PM, With Two Races First, Followed by Eight Races</h3>
<p>According to the observatory's report yesterday, although a hurricane was detected near Hong Kong and Typhoon Signal No. 7 was issued, the wind only intensified throughout the day without any rain. If the weather is sunny today, the turf should be slightly better than on Saturday and Sunday, but it is still likely to be soft and slippery. If the horses participating in the race are good at running on soft ground, we should bet as we did the other day, and there should be no major mistakes. However, since there is no need to avoid the rain, we can sit and watch comfortably, and it is also convenient to move around. It is expected that there will be a considerable increase in the number of spectators today. There will be ten races in total today, starting at 12:30 PM, with two races first, followed by a lunch break, and the races will continue at 2:30 PM. Horse racing fans, please pay attention to the time.</p>
<p>Special Report by Our Newspaper</p>
<h3>A Scene from "China Rescue" Yesterday: "Thief"!</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>"Thief"... Targeting Hong Kong Society</p>
<p>The China Rescue Drama Troupe's three performances yesterday were all sold out. What the reporter wants to especially introduce is the first act of "Defend the Motherland," "Thief." Because the gorgeous scenery and witty plot of "Thief" are especially suitable for the taste of the general Hong Kong audience.</p>
<p>The consciousness of "Thief" is aimed at the upper class of XX society.</p>
<p>The curtain opens, and applause rises, because the Westernized family, the deep three-dimensional architecture, the sparkling stars, and the sounds of the chapel all make many people regard it as the pinnacle of "beauty" and applaud. In fact, the truth of the "China Rescue" from the front lines and the countryside is not so, this is just a toolbox for setting off the plot.</p>
<p>The main theme of the play is to show that a wealthy family does not realize the truth that "if the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to? Only with a country can there be a home" until after they are robbed and enlightened by the "thief."</p>
<p>Wang Ying plays the young mistress, and Jin Shan plays the young master. Their decadent life is a portrayal of the licentious class in the city. The affairs of the country? Who cares! These two villainous characters are very hateful! They are two completely different people from Jin Shan and Wang Ying after they leave the stage. If their thinking were not armed, the licentious life on the stage might be their daily life. The two kinds of people and the two kinds of superb acting skills aroused a surge of thoughts in the reporter.</p>
<p>The young master's younger siblings—Fan Zheng and Qin Xiaozhu—came to the silver shop in their home to donate money to save the country. It can be seen that two different characters can also grow up in the same environment.</p>
<p>Another thief—played by Su Hui—is the XX of the people. After he explained his lament, the young master's parents made him bankrupt: life forced him to be a "gentleman on the roof"—Zi Ying, played by Ke Gang, is very suitable—they were all moved, sympathized with him, and forgave him, so they gave him a bowl of bird's nest. The "thief" said that bird's nest could not save a stomach that had been hungry for many days, and asked for leftovers. The young master actually said, "Bird's nest has Vitamin A!"</p>
<p>"When XX comes! There will be nothing left!"</p>
<p>"If the country is not strong, can individuals still have a good life?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>These three thieves persuaded the whole family—except for the young mistress who was unrepentant until death—amidst thunderous applause, the parents even gave the "three thieves" the items in the house and the silver that had just been stolen to donate money to save the country, and personally sent them out the door. ——Can the upper class in Hong Kong have such facts?</p>
<p>Wake up! Young mistresses!</p>
<p>The young mistress returning from a mahjong game (played by Wang Ying)</p>
<h3>Robbery! Robbery! Robbery! Eighteen Robberies Occurred in Four Weeks — Losses Exceeding Ten Thousand, Twelve Dead or Injured —</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been eighteen robberies at sea and on land in the past four weeks. Nine people died at the hands of bandits, three were shot, and three were captured. From the 30th of last month to the 27th of this month, there have been eighteen robberies at sea and on land, involving dozens of bandits. Only sixteen people have been arrested. According to absolutely reliable investigations, the details are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Situation in Eastern Guangdong is Deteriorating Daily; Our Guerrilla Force is Extremely Active, Launching Two-Pronged Attacks on Shilong and Shitan, Achieving a Great Victory; More Than a Hundred X Troops in Chicheng and Baima Were Ambushed and Annihilated</h3>
<p>[Huizhou Express] On the eastern Guangdong front, the X army is under our attack, and the situation is deteriorating. Although they have received reinforcements many times, they have all been annihilated by our army, which proves that the X army's source of troops is exhausted, and the signs of failure are evident.</p>
<p>Wu Wang's Regiment Presses Shilong: In Shilong, X and I are fighting for the stronghold. After many fierce battles, X's forces are exhausted. There are only about 500 troops (mixed troops) stationed there, entrenched and defending to the death. Our army's Security No. X Regiment, led by Wu Kangjian, is advancing with our Peng Division in Zhucun, Zhongxin Market, and other places northwest of Shilong, which is very tense. Taking advantage of the opportunity, they launched a surprise attack on Shilong and Shitan yesterday at 2 a.m., coordinated with the guerrilla force led by Wang Ruozhou. One group moved from Nanshe, and the other advanced from Hengyong. First, they defeated the X troops, and then they advanced towards Shilong Town. X responded hastily. Before long, our regiment used hand grenades to destroy X's fortifications and charged bravely. X was exhausted and retreated into the town, stubbornly resisting from the buildings. When our regiment approached the outskirts of the town, they all threw hand grenades fiercely at X's positions, destroying more than ten houses, annihilating dozens of X soldiers, and capturing more than ten rifles. The X troops in Shitan were also severely attacked by our Hengyong regiment, killing many X soldiers. By dawn, our regiment had completed its mission and safely returned to its original defense area.</p>
<p>X Troops in Chicheng Were Ambushed and Annihilated: The X troops in Guancheng are under our army's strict surveillance and cannot advance an inch. However, recently, the X army has been frequently transporting supplies on the Longtai Highway and has often harassed De Village near the highway, looting civilian food, and forcibly recruiting our strong men to replenish the ranks of puppet soldiers in order to struggle. Our Security Regiment, led by Wu, stationed for defense, in order to cut off the X troops' connection between Guantai, specially coordinated with the local guerrilla force yesterday to attack Baima, Chicheng, and other areas from Liaobu, Dashalu, and other places, and ambushed near Xiashanmen. After contacting the X troops, they pretended to retreat. X chased closely. When they reached Xiashanmen, our ambush force surrounded them, and more than a hundred X soldiers were annihilated. Now the regiment is still attacking the Chicheng area to cut off the X troops' connection between Guantai.</p>
<h3>Our Guerrilla Force in Qiongzhou Island Attacked Wenchang City Again, Destroying Many X Fortifications; X Troops Disturbed Various Villages to Vent Their Anger</h3>
<p>[Nanlu Express] Our isolated army and guerrilla force in Qiongzhou Island, under the command of Commander Wang Yi, have become increasingly active, inflicting heavy damage on X. The recent situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Our Guerrilla Force Attacks Wenchang: Yang Yongren, the commander of the eastern Qiongya guerrilla force, believes that X is actively building airports and warehouses in Wenchang City, forcing nearby villagers to complete the surrounding road network, attempting to create an important base for land and air forces. He ordered all guerrilla forces to seize the opportunity to attack X and destroy as much as possible. It was found that on the morning of the 19th of this month, more than 300 guerrillas from our Yang's unit rushed into Wenchang City and launched a fierce attack on X's headquarters, taking X by surprise. More than a hundred people were killed, and many fortifications were destroyed. After completing their mission, our guerrilla force withdrew safely as a whole unit. X, enraged, sent more than 500 X soldiers to harass dozens of villages, large and small, including Chenjia Village, Shagang, and Liwu, to vent their anger.</p>
<p>X Planes Bombard Extensively for Days: In addition, X troops attempted to eliminate our guerrilla base area. They have been setting fires to burn mountains continuously in recent days, cutting down and burning all the trees in the villages. Recently, Zhang also sent large teams of aircraft to bomb various places in Qiongzhou Island every day. Longzhou and Da'an villages in Ding'an County were bombed miserably on the 17th and 18th, attempting to raze the villages to the ground so that our guerrillas and security forces would have no way to hide. However, the mountains and ridges in the inland of Qiongya are continuous, and our army and civilians have penetrated deep into Zhongshan to carry out activities. X's attempt is just a dream.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Distribution of X Troops in Guangdong; Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 People in Total</h3>
<p>(Wengyuan Express) The X army on various lines in Guangdong Province has recently launched extremely frequent operations. It has been found that they are changing defense posts. In recent months, they have still been busy building fortifications and deploying defenses. Their frequent movements and aggressive posture are actually intended to contain our army's attacks. Currently, there are approximately 40,000 to 50,000 X troops in Guangdong Province. According to intelligence from a certain agency, their distribution is as follows: (1) There are approximately 1,000 people in Hutou and Taiping, belonging to the Iijima Yuhara Middle Village Lian Marine Corps; (2) The 56th Regiment of the 18th Division of X is stationed in Shilong, Shitan, and Zengcheng, and the 51st Regiment is stationed in Zhongluotan, Taipingchang, and Shegang. The 24th and 34th Regiments are deployed in the suburbs of Guangzhou; (3) A part of the 104th Division of X, approximately one regiment, is deployed on the Guanghua Road and south of Xinjie on the Yuehan Road, with the main force concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou; (4) In Sanshui, Xinan, Foshan, Jiujiang, Jiangmen, Xinhui, and other places, there are approximately two regiments of X infantry and a part of cavalry and artillery, which seem to belong to the 26th Division; (5) The Taiwan garrison team, the Iida release group, is still entrenched on the South China Sea Island, stationed in Chengmai, Ding'an, Haikou, Wenchang, and Lehui. Another large team of marines is in Jiusuo Yaxian Tengqiao. In addition, the X troops in Guangdong have recently been actively recruiting puppet troops and reorganizing puppet organizations, attempting to implement their poisonous plan to rule the occupied areas by using Chinese people to control Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Shantou Merchants Discount Agricultural Bank's Legal Tender; Central Branch Strictly Prohibits It</h3>
<p>(Shantou Correspondence) Shantou merchants discriminate against and discount banknotes of the Farmers Bank, and the authorities have issued a notice strictly prohibiting such practices. All Farmers Bank banknotes are to be used equally with the legal banknotes of the Central Bank, China Bank, and Bank of Communications. However, citizens still discount and discriminate against them. Recently, the surcharge has been as high as ten yuan per thousand yuan. Farmers Bank banknotes can be used to pay taxes to the customs tax collection office of the Central Bank in Shantou. Therefore, when merchants pay taxes, they all use Farmers Bank banknotes. The customs tax collection office receives approximately 100,000 yuan every day, which is all received by the Central Bank and transferred to Hong Kong. Approximately 300,000 yuan is transferred every month. According to Li Shouren, the president of the Central Bank in this city, the discrimination and discounting of Farmers Bank banknotes have been reported to the authorities, who have issued a notice strictly prohibiting such practices, but the discounting has not been curbed. Recently, the discount has become even lower. The bank has telegraphed its head office for instructions on prohibition.</p>
<h3>Qiongzhou Island X Wounded Soldiers Transported to Weizhou for Medical Treatment; Only a Hundred X Troops on Weizhou</h3>
<p>[Beihai Express] There are still more than a hundred X soldiers on Weizhou Island. They are secretly building air defense fortifications in Catholic churches with the iron bars that have been transported to the island, forcing the islanders to live in the X airport, sending troops into the countryside, and searching everywhere. The property of the islanders has been looted. At the same time, X committed a crime in Huanzi Village but failed. They burned all forty to fifty houses in the village and took more than ten people away, whose fate is unknown. A few days ago, an X transport ship transported more than thirty X wounded soldiers from Haikou, including five seriously wounded, to Weizhou Island. After that, more than twenty X soldiers were said to have boarded the ship from Rangzhou Island and sailed towards Haikou. According to passengers entering Qiongzhou by ship, there were no traces of X ships on the sea from Weizhou to Guantouling. The rumor that an aircraft carrier had returned to Weizhou was inaccurate. However, there were seven X ships in Haikou.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang X Attempts to Cross Illegally; X Ships Bomb Sanzhou, Repelled by Us</h3>
<p>[Xijiang Express] X in Jiujiang in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River has repeatedly attacked Heshan, attempting to contain our army. However, they have been severely attacked by our Longguang unit. On the 27th, X in Jiujiang used shallow-water ships to fire artillery to cover their landing in Daqueshan and Huangpinkeng. They attempted to attack Shaping Gubao and other places again. Our local defense forces immediately attacked X's ships and drove them back to Jiujiang on the opposite bank. On the morning of the 28th, four X ships sailed from Tingdou to the Taiping sea area and fired more than twenty artillery shells at Bian and Lanke villages in Sanzhou. Our defense forces also fired back. We and X exchanged fire for about two hours before the X ships sailed towards Jiujiang.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Widely Launched in Conghua and Huaxian Areas; X Troops Repeatedly Attacked in Jiangcun and Taihe; X Anxious and Convened a Meeting of All Ugly Elements to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Beijiang Express] The X army in the Cong (hua) and Hua (xian) areas still focuses on defense. Although there are occasional deployments, they are nothing more than a smokescreen of "advancing as retreating." The Second District Column, in coordination with the various departments of the Twelfth Army Group, has now launched extensive guerrilla warfare and has inflicted considerable damage on the X army in recent days. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Launch Extensive Guerrilla Warfare: It has been found that Conghua and Huaxian are the front lines of the Beijiang. In order to prevent our army from going south and to defend the outer perimeter of Guangzhou, X has a considerable defense force. Wu Guanqi, commander of the Second District Guerrilla Column, received an order from Ye Zhaolun, deputy commander of the Twelfth Army Group, to thoroughly promote extensive guerrilla warfare in order to support the regular army in launching a strong counterattack. Wu immediately ordered all the large teams to actively move. Large numbers of our guerrillas have been found to be active in Jiangcun, Banghu, Taihe, Shijing, Gaotang, and other places. Whether in public places, teahouses, or opium dens, there are people mixed in to carry out various anti-X propaganda activities. Every eight or nine o'clock, our guerrillas launched separate attacks on X, and gunshots rang out everywhere. As a result, order was disrupted, and many young people automatically joined the guerrillas, while the old, weak, women, and children fled to safe areas.</p>
<p>X Puppet Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures: After our guerrilla teams launched extensive guerrilla warfare in the above-mentioned areas, they inflicted a lot of damage on the X army. X was in a state of being surrounded on all sides. They had a wonderful idea and specially convened all the members of the puppet maintenance association and the heads of the various villages at the X headquarters in Jiangcun on the 24th to hold a so-called "pacification joint defense" meeting to discuss countermeasures. The meeting lasted for five or six hours before it adjourned. The X commander held a joint party at the puppet maintenance association in the afternoon to win over the hearts of the various traitors and puppets. The resolutions reached at the X traitor meeting that day included: (1) Thoroughly suppress the guerrilla forces. If X troops are attacked in the future, each village shall be responsible. The puppets in charge of the local puppet maintenance association shall also bear corresponding responsibility. Minor offenders will be recorded, and serious offenders will be dismissed or executed; (2) Remove the forests in the area where the X troops are stationed and block remote areas to prevent guerrilla teams from hiding and attacking on narrow paths; (3) All opium and gambling dens are prohibited from staying open all night or providing lodging to prevent guerrilla teams from mixing in; (4) Those who report guerrilla teams in each village will be rewarded by the X army. Those who knowingly fail to report will be punished as accomplices. Judging from the various resolutions decided by the X army, we can see the panic and anxiety they are experiencing.</p>
<h3>Beihai Merchants Telegraph Request for Equalization of Foreign Exchange Rate Spreads; Request to Supplement and Pay Hong Kong Dollars Denied</h3>
<p>(Beihai Express) The Beihai Chamber of Commerce convened more than twenty representatives of various firms yesterday to discuss the letter from the Beihai Animal Tax Office, which stated that those who had previously supplemented and paid the price of foreign exchange sold and settled in national currency must uniformly supplement and pay Hong Kong dollars and return the national currency. The merchants believed that the Beihai Customs Tax Collection Office currently sells and settles foreign exchange, and the expenditure is calculated at 1.8 national currency per Hong Kong dollar, while the income is calculated at 1.87 national currency per Hong Kong dollar, which is actually 70 yuan more in national currency per thousand yuan. Therefore, they telegraphed the superior to order the issuance of the excess amount and stipulate the same price for both entry and exit to ensure fairness. Now, the General Administration Office has sent a letter to decorate the Tax Collection Office and take back the city price difference, while the Animal Tax Office wants the merchants to supplement and pay Hong Kong dollars in exchange for national currency, which is difficult to comply with. We are now waiting for the superior to resolve it.</p>
<h3>Our Team in Northern Guangdong Organized a Commando Team to Search for Remnant X Troops; X Has a "Sweeping Team" Organization, Used Only for Robbing Food</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) After the remnant X troops in northern Guangdong were severely annihilated by our army, they have not dared to disturb the people in recent days. They are only resting in their strongholds. Occasionally, they send out so-called "sweeping teams" to rob food and raw materials from various villages. There are currently two X infantry companies and one artillery company between Huaxian and Longkou. There is one infantry company in Fengyong. Between Zengcheng and Fuhe Zhucun, there is a joint team of X infantry, artillery, and cavalry, totaling approximately 1,000 people. The X headquarters is still located in Xinjie. In order to crush X's sweeping conspiracy, our army specially selected elite troops from the front-line units to form a commando team, which departed to search for remnant X troops.</p>
<h3>Provincial Relief Association Investigates Relief Funds in Various Counties</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express) The Provincial Relief Association previously allocated relief funds to the relief associations in various counties for the purpose of providing relief to refugees. The Relief Association has never reported how the funds were kept, whether they were used, or other matters. In order to clarify the truth and facilitate overall planning, the Association issued an instruction yesterday, requiring the relief associations in various counties to report on the custody of the relief funds received and stored within three days of receiving the document for verification and handling. It also stipulated that if the funds were used in the future, they should be reported at any time.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Instructs Subordinates to Prevent X from Poisoning Salt; Several Cases Discovered in Nanxiong and Renhua</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express) The Provincial Government issued an instruction to its subordinates yesterday, stating: "According to Tan Shi, the magistrate of Nanxiong County, salt was recently discovered to have been poisoned by X in Fuxi Market in the county and Changjiang Market in neighboring Renhua County. When the salt is stir-fried in a wok, it turns red, green, black, and other colors. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and no one was harmed. Please inform your subordinates to be vigilant." This shows X's malicious intent to harm us. Therefore, you are instructed to inform and disseminate this information.</p>
<h3>Zhongshan to Implement Cigarette Management Starting Next Month; Registration Began the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Zhongshan Express) Zhang Huichang, the magistrate of Zhongshan County, and Lu Zhixiong, the director of the Taxation Bureau, received a telegram from Gu Yiqun, the director of the Finance Department, stating that in order to implement the central government's thrift policy and cultivate the people's strength, cigarette management will be implemented starting from June 1. A management fee of 35% will be levied according to the wholesale price. All regulations have been promulgated. In order to prevent malpractices, the following emergency measures have been formulated with reference to successful cases in various provinces: From the 21st to June 10, all cigarettes currently stored and imported by tobacco merchants in the province will be temporarily suspended from being exported out of the province. The existing and accumulated cigarette brands, quantities, destinations, and other items to be transferred and transported shall be registered with the Taxation Bureau. Those who resist registration will be sealed up. Those who violate the order and transport them out of the province privately will be detained and punished to warn against cunning. After receiving the telegram, the county fear bureau chief immediately summoned the tobacco merchants in the area under his jurisdiction to give them a detailed explanation and strictly ordered the military and police agencies under his jurisdiction to provide practical assistance without any favoritism or negligence. He also telegraphed back to report on the implementation and the registered quantities. Magistrate Zhang and Director Ying have complied with the order and implemented it, and registration will be carried out on the 27th.</p>

<h3>The Lifespan of Male and Female Performers: Female Performers Have Shorter Lifespans Than Male Performers</h3>
<p>I remember that Ferbert had a table of statistics on the lifespan of performers in "Twentieth Century Theater," which looked like this:</p>
<p>Average lifespan of famous male performers: over 66 years old</p>
<p>Average lifespan of famous female performers: over 61 years old</p>
<p>Average lifespan of ordinary male performers: 45 years old</p>
<p>Average lifespan of ordinary female performers: over 37 years old</p>
<p>Average lifespan of male performers: 55 years old</p>
<p>Average lifespan of female performers: 49 years old</p>
<p>According to the table above, female performers generally have shorter lifespans than male performers. This is probably because women are mostly physically weak. As for famous performers, they live longer than ordinary performers, of course, because they have broad minds, are carefree, and have no worries. On the other hand, how can the lives of ordinary performers who eat breakfast but have no dinner and are tormented by poverty be long?</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese performers, the old antique performers of the past often lived to be fifty, sixty, seventy, or eighty years old. Nowadays, there are fewer who live long. Mixing in female colors and eating black rice are really two deadly injuries.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Sweethearts"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua Sweethearts MGM Production</p>
<p>I think the screenwriter of "Sweethearts" is quite innocent and lovely. He really tells us this kind of story: "On Broadway, a playwright, for a special relationship, broke up a loving couple. His trick was to make a wife believe that her husband was having an affair with their female secretary. He sent someone to steal the love letters the husband wrote to his wife and put them into the script, letting the wife believe that her husband also had a similar letter written to that female secretary." The so-called "special relationship" is also related to conflicts of interest with the producer of the couple. However, the screenwriter also showed his cleverness. The couple are famous stage stars on Broadway, and because of the invitation of Hollywood film companies, he came up with this plan to prevent them from going to Hollywood. But because of the screenwriter's cleverness, he also told us about the secret competition between Hollywood and Broadway for hiring famous actors.</p>
<p>"Sweethearts" is Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's first color film. Because it is a color film, the director, Mr. Van Dyke, has done his best in costumes, scenery, and props to make them luxurious, quiet, and harmonious. For example, the three-act opera at the beginning, the simplicity and beauty of the first scene of the Dutch farmer's song, the bright and dazzling second scene of "The Fate of the Play," and the harmonious beauty of the third scene of "Sweethearts." Not only that, but in every scene, the director is very careful in the color matching. When Jeanette MacDonald wears a brightly colored shirt in the dressing room and puts on makeup in front of the mirror, the color not only sets off MacDonald's beauty even more, but it also feels very comfortable to watch. There is also MacDonald's fashion show, which indeed introduces the popular new costumes in Hollywood, but isn't it also showing the function of color films?</p>
<p>Have you seen "Marie Antoinette"? Were you moved by Van Dyke's excellent skills? (That's about the life of Marie Antoinette, not a history of the French Revolution.) But "Sweethearts" is a comedy. It reverses that kind of profound and moving delicate depiction. The whole film develops in a light and cheerful melody, all the way to the end. What I particularly like is the scene where MacDonald listens to the playwright's new script. The couple is getting ready to leave, but it is disrupted by the appearance of the playwright. This scene uses music to set off MacDonald's psychological state, which is very lovely, especially the transition.</p>
<p>Don't you like Loretta Young in "Wives Under Suspicion"? Then, Franklin Pangborn, who plays the producer, Felix Lehman, is also equally lovable.</p>

<h3>Deanna Durbin Has Changed; She Actually Looks Like an Adult</h3>
<p>Deanna Durbin, this is a lovely girl, is gradually growing up. She is now wearing high heels, long clothes, and adult-like hats. She is sixteen years old this year, "Soon to be seventeen," she will tell you that.</p>
<p>In a certain scene in the filming of "Three Smart Girls Grow Up," the floor was very smooth, and there was a huge mirror hanging on the wall. Deanna was wearing a light pink and silver evening dress (this was the first time she wore this way on camera). When she walked out generously, she immediately saw herself in the mirror, how eye-catching and beautiful the clothes she was wearing. She moved forward solemnly, while paying attention to the reflection on the floor and the shadow in the mirror. So beautiful, indeed she is much bigger.</p>
<p>Deanna no longer eats ice cream and sweets. She eats regularly. She never drinks coffee, but she still likes milk. She no longer chews gum. Now she is very interested in reading. In the past year, she has read six or seven famous novels.</p>
<p>She has learned to dance. Now she can dance the fox trot and the Peabody, but she has not yet learned the steps of "Jitterbuy." She can also drive a car, and she has also obtained a driver's license.</p>

<h3>Drama School Produced by MGM Starring Luise Rainer, Allyn Joslyn, and Paulette Goddard</h3>
<p>"I envy you will see one day how you succeed," Anna felt astonished. "Going to school during the day, and doing this lowly work all night. Not one night can sleep comfortably." Their job was assembling gas meters on the night shift in a factory. A class has to work ten hours. A large group of withered women monotonously move their hands to tighten the screws on the fittings that are moved over on the belt.</p>
<p>Luise said: "That is easy. I always think of poor Dusi, who often slept on park benches at first."</p>
<p>But that was not really easy. Every day her eyes were gradually closing, and she felt her head was so heavy that it was not easy to stand upright on her shoulders. But in drama school, she had to stand straight! Must strictly train in fencing, fitness, and posture. Then must rehearse drama, during rehearsal time, have to walk with books on their heads to get perfect balance.</p>
<p>She was always so tired. Classmates—even teachers—believed she was too diligent. Because she was too tired to be happy, they thought she was arrogant and aloof. Luise ignored it. Not only did self-esteem make her do this, although she knew that classmates would definitely laugh at her "private life" if they found out. She didn't really care about their ridicule. But she had a need in her heart to create a new personality to play the role she created herself.</p>
<p>"So sorry!" If someone asked her to join the extracurricular games of her classmates, she always said to them like this. "I would love to participate, but I am too busy with work." There was no other explanation. This kind of attitude often made some students unhappy. Who did she think she was anyway? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Charity Football Match South China Cleanly Defeated Mixed Team Three to Zero Feng Jingxiang Twice Opened the Scoring with Headers</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Provisional Report) Yesterday afternoon, the Observatory hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 7. The general public thought that the charity football match would probably not be held again. By five o'clock, the wind and rain had not yet arrived. Therefore, this game, which had been postponed several times, was finally held at Jia Mountain. There were also thousands of spectators present.</p>
<p>The lineup had changed. Many players from the Allied team were absent, so players from South China were temporarily transferred to join as guest players. Therefore, the name of the Allied team should be canceled and changed to a Mixed Team.</p>
<p>Hou Rongsheng still played for the Mixed Team. As for the right inside midfielder position for South China, it was taken by Mai Shaohan, who had been absent for a long time due to a foot injury and had now recovered.</p>
<p>During the match, Kai Youyao shone brightly. However, as several opponents of Xing Huawei were "family members," he could not help but show mercy, so there was no fierce competition.</p>
<p>The South China forwards were very active. Individual techniques, such as those of Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong, were wonderfully displayed, forming a pleasing sight. Luo Douwen also made many good plays. Li Huitang had few opportunities to be active. Although he took advantage of opportunities to shoot several times, he was unsuccessful. Therefore, yesterday was actually the day to break his own record of winning every match he played in. The central midfielder Liu Qingcai, advancing and retreating, was able to provide great assistance to the forwards and defenders. The other players also performed satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The Mixed Team's players lacked coordination. It seemed that they were fighting individually. Hou Chengtao's dribbling was solid, but he was unable to act according to the situation. He was often intercepted by the South China defenders. Yang Shui had several chances to score, but he failed to hit the target. Center-back Dixon was the most outstanding person on the field. He closely guarded Li Huitang on one hand and provided the forwards with excellent passes on the other. His footwork was light and he kicked with extraordinary ease. Li Anna, playing out of position as an inside forward, also looked steady. De Gasson saved many dangerous shots. Although they lost by a score of three to zero, it was not his fault.</p>

<p>Buddha Lord Wants to Start Killing Dehui Fails to Score with Header</p>
<p>The weather was about to turn bad, with wind and rain coming. Fortunately, the heavens had mercy and provided convenience, preventing the event from being delayed again. Thus, surrounded by the eager anticipation of thousands of spectators, the battle was launched on time.</p>
<p>As the horn sounded, the two armies moved out and fought several rounds against each other. Suddenly, Feng "2-1" charged forward, luring Jingcheng to attack, finding an empty space, and giving "Buddha Lord" a very good opportunity. Wang waited to aim at the "dragon gate," wanting to start killing.</p>
<p>Knowing that Yang Genbao met the attack, he eradicated the "Buddha Lord" desire. Although it resulted in a corner kick, it was not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>Guo Wei committed a foul in the midfield. Dixon passed a free kick to Shuiyi, who immediately cut in. The momentum was very good. Dehui arrived at the ball and used his head to strike towards the goal. However, the ball hit the post and bounced into the wilderness, scaring Jiaping.</p>
<p>Douwen's Wonderful Corner Kick Second Uncle Performs Meritorious Service</p>
<p>You attacked, I defended, the situation was tense and exciting. Then "Ball Monster" got the ball and passed it left and right. Douwen got the ball and used all his strength, passing by Genbao. The corner kick was wonderfully executed. Anna failed to head it. De Gasson was vacant. It fell from "Second Uncle"'s head. A little nod from his head broke De Gasson's policy. The "Chen Boss" sitting next to me kept praising "Second Uncle" for this move.</p>
<p>South China won first, and the momentum was strong. In the blink of an eye, Jing Huo Huo, and Zhaorong passed to each other, as if two dragons were playing with a ball. As he approached the enemy's gate, Jingxiang immediately shot low, but De Gasson, having learned from the lesson just now, was prepared. As the ball flew over, he quickly squatted down and embraced it fully.</p>
<p>Ball Monster First Fires Canon Douwen Has Excellent Plays</p>
<p>Tuo Ban was restless, but because the forwards did not cooperate, he could not go deep. Occasionally, he launched a couple of flanking attacks, but they were futile.</p>
<p>Jingxiang had good skills. He dribbled the ball in midfield, making Qiu Chen unable to touch it. After a while, Huitang, received Jingxiang's assistance and fired the first shot, but it was saved by De Gasson.</p>
<p>Chengtao sought an opportunity to advance and went deep to the baseline. But when he met Su Zai, he could no longer advance. In a hurry, he cut the ball, but it was "far from the topic."</p>
<p>Douwen had excellent plays, which were very satisfactory. Once, with the help of Zhaorong, he passed the ball forcefully, crossing the "dragon gate," just falling at Guangsen's feet. Seeing this opportunity, Guangsen refused to let it go and drew back his bow and shot fiercely, but it was blocked by De Gasson and then cleared by Jingcheng.</p>
<p>Guo Wei entangled Tuo Ban, causing an infringement foul. Fortunately, it was not in the penalty area. Shuiyi took the free kick, landing on Chengtao's side, but he failed to head it. Shuiyi got it again and cut it in beautifully. Dehui施以頂上功夫, but it fell outside.</p>
<p>Shijin Has Nothing Good to Say Jingxiang Reports Another Happy News</p>
<p>Douwen made a comeback, and Genbao came out to meet him, but he ate one backhanded, and lost another corner kick. Douwen opened it, and Huichang received it and shot, but it did not hit. Then Huichang hid at the baseline on the left, got a wonderful pass from Guo Wei, turned around and knocked on the door, performing excellently, but De Gasson grabbed the ball and sent it to the front.</p>
<p>Shijin repeatedly failed to advance, and he did not cooperate with Chengtao, so there was nothing good to praise.</p>
<p>Soon, the South China forwards were active in the front again. Zhaorong got the ball and rushed to the baseline, lifted the ball up. Jingxiang then used his old trick, heading on, making De Gasson at a loss, like a startled bird, watching the ball fly in. So South China scored another goal.</p>
<p>After this, South China still had many attacks. Once, Douwen had a wonderful shot, but Jingxiang's final shot was blocked by the crossbar for De Gasson. Before long, the first half was over.</p>
<p>South China's Eventful Autumn The Fuji Corporation Will Be Very Busy</p>
<p>After a short rest, they regrouped and fought again. At this point, the forwards of the Mixed Team performed more vigorously. Soon, Chengtao got a corner kick, but it was ineffective.</p>
<p>Huitang wanted to make a contribution, and he used breakthrough methods several times, entering from the middle, but he was intercepted by Qiuchen in front and blocked by Li Anna behind. He could not move his feet and looked at the door and sighed.</p>
<p>Shuiyi took the opportunity to advance along the side, forcing a corner kick. It opened just right. Dickson intercepted and shot, but it was another wild arrow.</p>
<p>At this time, the members of the Mixed Team were active in the South China no-fly zone, rigorously finding gaps, becoming an eventful autumn, making Tiansheng, Shaohan, etc. quite busy. Once, Shuiyi shot at close range, and Tiansheng blocked the disaster with his back, losing a corner kick. Shuiyi opened it, and Tuo Ban received it and shot at the goal, but it did not hit, but shot the camera of the color taker on the side of the dragon gate, falling to the ground. I do not know if Tuo Ban's move was captured in the lens.</p>
<p>Jiaping Turns Danger into Safety South China Wins Two Clean Balls</p>
<p>Suddenly, horizontal wind and oblique rain, coming in bursts, South China fought against the wind, quite threatened, but the Mixed team's front line communication was loose, although there were opportunities for advancement, they could not make contributions.</p>
<p>After a while, Shuiyi walked to the Liben position, mixed into the middle, and passed the ball to the left. Chengtao got it near the baseline and handed it to Dehui. This was the only winning opportunity for the Mixed Team. It looked like it was bound to go in, but Dehui's shot hit Jiaping's hand, and he took the opportunity to hold it out, turning danger into safety.</p>
<p>Genbao fought bravely, fighting for the ball with Zhaorong, doing a somersault, and losing his belt, almost revealing his true face, causing the whole stadium to laugh.</p>
<p>They fought each other, each advancing and retreating. In the last minute, Rongsheng grabbed the ball and came out, kicking it to the right. Shuiyi did not guard his position, so it was intercepted by Guo Wei. This time, it was actually South China's chance to win again. The ball was sent forward by Guo Wei. Zhaorong intercepted and passed it, just falling in front of Guangsen. He did not wait for the ball to land, lifted his leg and shot, skewing into the net. De Gasson pounced 空, this ball already entered, the armistice笛 was鳴, 南華 defeated a three 比零 clear victory and thus completed the此次筆, although the two 入 was not much, it can be considered as a功德無量了 (ball court 本歳)</p>

<h3>On the Decline of the Shanghai Yen</h3>
<p>If the issuance of so-called "Joint Notes" and the use of military scrip were intended, it was unexpected that these types of "notes" and "scrip" could not compete with the Chinese legal tender. Japan, aiming to take advantage of the current tense international situation to complete its attempt to establish a "Yen Bloc" that would exclude the interests of European and American powers in China, is using various methods to transport Japanese banknotes to China. The recent surge in the Shanghai Yen is likely due to this reason. Moreover, the Japanese Yen flowing into the occupied areas of China along with the Japanese army is not regarded as reliable wealth by either Chinese or Japanese merchants. After accepting the Yen, they either immediately exchange it for legal tender or further use the legal tender to speculate in Chinese foreign exchange. As a result, this type of Yen has gradually concentrated in Shanghai, eventually impacting market prices. The Japanese government seems to have anticipated this phenomenon long ago. In recent weeks, the Japanese government has prohibited tourists from carrying Yen to Japan and also disallowed the use of Yen to pay for goods transported from Japan and Northeast China to Shanghai. This is to prevent the Yen's devaluation from backfiring on Japan. Furthermore, the so-called "Joint Notes" linked to the Yen have recently depreciated to below 60 percent. The newly established Huaxing Bank is rumored to be using Yen to buy legal tender, leading to a large influx of Yen into the market. Therefore, the current sharp decline in the Yen's value is indeed the inevitable result of various factors converging. The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy is certainly not ignorant of this.</p>
<p>Currently, the Yen in China has become a tumor in the Japanese economy. Japan's desired "Yen Bloc" has indeed begun to be implemented, but the currency within a bloc must have the same value. However, the foreign exchange value of the Shanghai Yen is only half of the foreign exchange value of the Yen in Japan. If Japan does not make every effort to support the value of the Yen in China but instead severs the connection between its domestic and foreign Yen, then the illusion of the so-called Yen Bloc will quickly disappear. However, if it wants to vigorously support the price of the Yen in China, can it establish a huge foreign exchange fund for the inflated Yen in China? This is not only beyond Japan's current financial capacity but would also be sufficient to accelerate the collapse of its domestic monetary system.</p>
<h3>Sampan Driving Method</h3>
<p>— Pan Yeshao</p>
<p>The driving method discussed here is limited to the scope of sampans that can be steered and rowed. Although there are many other things to learn in order to handle the navigation of various boats, mastering these basic techniques will generally be more helpful and easier to succeed in learning advanced boating skills.</p>
<p>Within the realm of boating techniques, we should not only learn these skills for recreational purposes but also consider practical applications. Therefore, all types of sailboats, double-oared boats, single-scull boats, and sculling boats, whether Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, are worth practicing for potential needs. However, someone proficient in single-oar sampan driving can easily ride on any floating object by using a paddle. It can be said that as long as something can float, they can stand on it and propel it forward by pushing the water. From this, we can see that if we don't want to achieve anything in water sports, that's one thing; otherwise, learning this technique is of great value. In other words, those with sampan driving skills can enjoy water recreation and have a wide range of uses for simple water tools, both in normal times and in emergencies.</p>
<p>Propelling a boat forward is not difficult, but being able to determine and change its direction at will while the boat is moving forward is daunting for most learners, who don't know how to achieve the goal of independently operating a sampan. The reason for this is actually quite simple.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Cup Basketball Charity Match Kicks Off Tonight: Zhi Xing vs. Southwest Only One Men's Group B Final</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Match is scheduled to begin tonight, with Zhi Xing facing Southwest. Two Group B finals will also be held, the first at 6:30 PM between Li Xing and Chun Feng, and the second at 8:30 PM between International and Guangzhong, all at the Youth Gymnasium. However, the first match between Li Xing players has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances, so there will only be one match each for men and women.</p>
<p>The women's match is expected to be quite a spectacle, as it is for a charitable cause, and all players will surely do their best to showcase their excellent skills and refresh the audience's eyes. Moreover, many players in the Zhi Xing team are representatives of the National Games, such as Chen Yuntang, Lin Shaoping, Huang Yiru, Sun Yuming, Xi Huizhuang, Deng Yanhao, and Chen Qihuan, who are all experienced and have exceptional combat effectiveness. Southwest is also full of vitality, with players like He Huanxiang, Zhu Zhizhi, Wu Ruixin, Li Chanqing, and Ye Peizhi, all of whom are brave and have excellent fighting spirit. The confrontation between the two teams tonight should be a wonderful performance. The men's Group B match between International and Guangzhong is between teams of similar strength and is bound to be a fierce battle, as Guangzhong is actively improving and International has a strong defense.

<h3>A Whiff of Fragrance and the Jews</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>On the 26th, a Hong Kong newspaper's news page carried the following news under the flamboyant headline "After a Whiff of Fragrance, Everyone is in Tears":</p>
<p>"Shanghai Special Dispatch: Recently, a strange disease has been spreading here, with patients experiencing uncontrollable tears, as if exposed to tear gas. However, it is only temporary..."</p>
<p>The discovery of this "uncontrollable" strange disease in the bustling streets of Shanghai is indeed startling news. To ensure journalistic integrity, the reporter even interviewed a patient suffering from this strange disease, and the interview was published along with the news to prove the accuracy and credibility of the source. Here is the special dispatch, in the reporter's words:</p>
<p>"The reporter met with a patient of this disease today, who claimed to have smelled a certain gas before falling ill, with a very fragrant scent and a cooling sensation in the eyes. However, after contracting the disease, they felt quite uncomfortable, with tears streaming down their face..."</p>
<p>Based on this report witnessed by the reporter, it is probably not false, right? Therefore, the average reader will naturally be greatly puzzled: "Why is there tear gas on the streets?" A clever reporter wrote the answer, saying:</p>
<p>"It is possible that Jewish refugees, arriving here in large numbers, possess various specialties. Perhaps their medical professionals deliberately spread a chemical gas in the area as a means of livelihood."</p>
<p>Whether or not it was done by displaced Jewish people is not the primary concern. However, the phrase "it is possible" sounds like the tone of a Japanese military spokesman speaking to Western reporters. Unfortunate, or rather, Jewish refugees. If we follow our humble opinion, those with tear gas are unlikely to be Jewish refugees. Although Jewish refugees "possess various specialties," they are far less skilled in the art of killing than the world-renowned Japanese soldiers. It is a well-known fact that Japanese soldiers operating in various parts of China carry various types of poison gas. In order to carry out a certain conspiracy, the Japanese may well release poison gas in Shanghai and falsely accuse the Jews. Isn't that the truth? When the German Nazi Party began to expel Jews on a large scale at the end of last year, the fascist Japanese military, emulating the trend, also chanted the heretical theory that "Jews are all communists" and were anti-Semitic. So, who exactly is the culprit behind the "whiff of fragrance causing everyone to be in tears" in Shanghai this time? It's not hard to imagine. The Hong Kong Chinese Evening News had an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th saying:</p>
<p>"Local Japanese newspapers, such as the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, published an editorial yesterday for the first time expressing anti-Jewish sentiments, stating that 9,000 European Jewish refugees have arrived in Shanghai, and the Hongkou area will become a Jewish kingdom. Jews are known for their skill in trade, and the interests of the Japanese are feared to be harmed..."</p>
<p>If the news mentioned earlier is read in conjunction with this, the underlying mystery becomes even clearer. However, some Chinese newspapers, without thoroughly investigating the truth, actually published such strange news for the Japanese, which is no different from the Japanese fulfilling a propaganda role. Smart readers must open their eyes wide here.</p>
<h3>Forging</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>We are in forging</p>
<p>Forging can increase people's mental and physical strength. We know that fish forget their hunger in the ice, and their eyes become blind. Deer develop their necks due to climbing trees for food. Boatmen who have experienced hardship and seen shocking waves and dangerous capsizes multiple times can handle them steadily. The difficulty of passage is often a good lesson in marine life.</p>
<p>A person needs forging to strive for growth and health. Forging is often storms, difficulties, worries, blows, practice, and labor. You don't have to be afraid or shrink back. For you, this is a good opportunity. You can take advantage of it to hone yourself. From some difficulties, from hardships, from impossibilities, from insults, you become another person. There is no difficult word in your dictionary, you see hardship as a delicacy, you turn the impossible into heat practice, and you smile at the enemy's head while sharpening your Wu hook.</p>
<p>Look, that is the field of a blacksmith. The stars twinkle in the darkness. Hammer blows are struck on the branded iron. On a large anvil in a workshop, red snake tongues and green flames erupt from the blazing fire, like flowers of light, singing passionately. Although it is a painful incentive and a relentless blow that makes it hurt, makes it sour, makes it resentful, and makes it weep, it does not shed tears, does not groan, does not shrink back, and does not cry. It stands up, endures tears and sadness, on the giant anvil, in the water tank, under the iron hammer. It is forged and tempered.</p>
<p>Cold becomes warm, black becomes red, brittle becomes flexible. After being tortured by external forces, the forged iron tastes hardship and becomes more lively, braver, and stronger.</p>
<p>We love to see sparks twinkle in the dark night. We love to hear the sharp sound of the hammer, making a loud noise. Light and light collide, force and force conflict. Light is passionate, and force is immense.</p>
<p>We must have light, we must have heat - we must forge. This is the test of survival, this is the threat of death, this is the bitter struggle, this is the herald of victory, this is the desperate revenge, this is the sweeping away of the last grain of stupid sand, this is the elegy of pain, this is the tempering of copper bones and iron muscles.</p>
<p>"The second storm of storms attacked and destroyed civilization madly. Violence, like an iron hand, pinched the heart of peace. The misfortune of the century makes us hurt, sour, resentful, and we weep, but we do not shed tears, do not groan, do not shrink back, and do not cry. We must use this hardship to hone ourselves. Many hardships make a country prosperous. We solemnly and strongly accept this gift—we come to forge."</p>
<p>We come to forge, for growth and health.</p>
<h3>The Bombing of Tuanfeng</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>—War Zone Chronicle—</p>
<p>The gentle river wind at dawn caresses every soldier. "How pleasant!" everyone exclaimed. Soon, the sun unfolded its smiling face and sincerely kissed the mountain peaks on both banks, as if to say, "Friends, work harder, the light will always shine on you." That day, a group of nine of us left the embrace of Wuhan and went down the river to Tuanfeng on the north bank of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Tuanfeng is the main town of Huanggang County in Hubei Province. The towering Erzhou to the southeast crouch like lions, and the surging river roars constantly at their feet. It is said that this is where Liu Yu of the Jin Dynasty defeated Huan Xuan. In military terms, Huanggang covers Wuhan from above and controls Jiujiang from below, so the situation is very important. Therefore, Tuanfeng is their target for destruction and is constantly bombed desperately. Because we had to pass through Luotian to enter the mountains, we had to go through Tuanfeng, and we also had some temporary work, so we came here.</p>
<p>The boat docked. The town's air raid siren suddenly sounded. The people crowded on the riverbank immediately dispersed in all directions. The bustling morning market also disappeared under the urgent sound of the bell. "Damn it! Come on, the people of Tuanfeng are not afraid of death," curses echoed through the streets and alleys. Even the children's eyes burst into flames of anger. Indeed, the flames of national spirit spread with the bombing and continued to spread to every corner. Who says there is no certainty of victory?</p>
<p>The buzzing sound came from the sky. The whole town was as quiet as a lonely tomb, but the sound of footsteps on the street could still be heard faintly. This was the military police patrolling to prevent the discovery of "signals." As I turned the corner on the street, suddenly a hand was placed on my shoulder. "Ah, you are here. Will the military-civilian get-together be held on time tonight?" Fang Shizhang, who was stationed in Tuanfeng, appeared at the end of the street. This calm and normal attitude was of course due to long experience in battle. "Even if Tuanfeng is bombed into the ground, we will still hold it!..." Before he could finish speaking, seven bombers were already circling in the sky.</p>
<p>"There are five more!...Ah, they are splitting up!..." Someone was talking.</p>
<p>Boom—boom—</p>
<p>The sound of the exploding bombs continued like a mountain collapsing, and black smoke filled the surroundings. I don't know where a tree flew up and fell from the smoke onto the rushing beach. Tiles, bricks, and gravel flew everywhere like hail. Each time a bomb landed, a gust of wind rushed into the entrance of the air raid shelter. This continued for about three-quarters of an hour before it stopped. The rescue team and the fire brigade immediately set out and carried out the work they should do separately. But strangely, as a result of the bombing, apart from a yellow cow that died an unnatural death, Tuanfeng was still intact.</p>
<h3>Short-lived Gorgeous Flower</h3>
<p>— Jun Bo</p>
<p>Should we say how much beauty a gorgeous flower adds to the world? Friend, you say, you have a clever head. Should these verdant branches be a symbol of the robustness of a short-lived gorgeous flower? Look at its arrogant appearance, stealing the brilliance of the sun and moon, borrowing a gentle breeze, and flaunting its arrogant coy smile. This is really embarrassing. Its coy smile steals the spirit of many small flowers. Friend, don't be moved, shut off your heart, don't pay attention to its charming manipulations.</p>
<p>Yes, you said it well, picking it is not considered a sin, cutting its roots and breaking its branches, to see how capable it is. Use the rough tip of the foot to dig up the home of earthworms.</p>
<p>Agile swallows are unwilling to use thin wefts to capture its branches. This is originally its own evil. Who is willing to lean their youth on it and tell the root feelings of their heart, unless a few ugly toads, resting their long necks on its lap, sing a hoarse tune, to win a little favor from it. Friend, don't just get angry, look at our arms. They are strong enough.</p>
<p>Who says it is really a good diamond, it is short-lived, and there will soon be a day of withering. Let us shout, shaking its heart, "Short-lived beautiful flower, bah? Be careful of your years!"</p>
<h3>On the Way Home (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Li</p>
<p>In the town, there was a garrison of friendly troops. When I passed over the bridge, the sentry standing on the bridge looked at my documents again and again, and questioned me very carefully, before letting me pass. The houses in the town were filled with friendly troops. I searched for a long time before I borrowed a place to stay in a teahouse, and spent the night sleeping on two tea tables put together.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, I arrived at Lizhuang Bridge. Because the ship to Wujin had already left, I had to wait until 8 o'clock tomorrow before I could get on a ship, so I stopped here.</p>
<p>As I was passing the entrance of a teahouse, suddenly an unfamiliar person grabbed me from behind. I was startled and stunned for a moment, but the man smiled at me and pointed to the inside of the restaurant and said to me, "Their squad leader invites you!"</p>
<p>I became even more panicked.</p>
<p>When I looked into the restaurant, I saw the face of our reconnaissance squad leader smiling at me. So I happily stepped in.</p>
<p>"How did you get here too?" he asked me with a smile on his face first.</p>
<p>"How did you guys get here?" I asked back.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they told me about catching someone and showed me the documents they had found.</p>
<p>Because I was not feeling well and had walked a long distance, I was feeling a bit dizzy. So, I was preparing to find a place to sleep for a while, so a local comrade who had just joined our reconnaissance squad insisted on helping me open a room at a hotel.</p>
<p>The next morning at eight o'clock, I took the ship to Wujin. Because I was still feeling a bit dizzy, I used my luggage as a pillow and lay down.</p>
<p>When the ship arrived at a small village, a man wearing dark glasses got off. At that time, no one paid any attention to him. But when the ship was halfway there, which was the gap between the opposing forces, I was in a daze of reverie when I was suddenly awakened by a sound. When I looked back, the man wearing dark glasses was holding a Mauser pistol and darted out from behind the ship's cabin.</p>
<p>"Everyone be sensible."</p>
<p>He pointed his gun at us and shouted.</p>
<p>Everyone on the ship was stunned.</p>
<p>He began to search everyone with one hand, and quickly stuffed what he found into his pocket.</p>
<p>At this time, I was hiding a general anger, and prepared to give him a surprise when he searched me, knocking his gun away. I acted as if nothing was happening, closed my eyes slightly, and continued to lie on my side. But after searching for a while, he missed me and threatened the ship to dock and escaped.</p>
<p>Along the way, people on the ship were noisy, blaming each other.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the evening, I stepped onto the land of another world. Feeling like I was walking into hell, I was walking on the brightly lit streets of Wujin.</p>
<p>I looked at the bustling compatriots, the puppet police standing on the streets, the dazzling neon lights, the dilapidated houses of burnt wood and broken bricks... I silently gritted my teeth and secretly shed tears of grief and anger!</p>
<p>Because I didn't have a good citizen certificate, I was rejected by all the hotels. Finally, a few old people pointed me to a secret inn, and asked a child to lead me there.</p>
<p>This was a semi-destroyed house repaired crudely with wooden planks in a pile of rubble. The inside was as dirty as a pigsty, with a few mats spread on the ground. Another room had two broken beds.</p>
<p>That night, I was very dizzy and tired, but I couldn't sleep with excitement. I kept my eyes open until dawn.</p>
<p>The next day, I escaped from getting a vaccination and took a boat to Wuxi, and changed boats to Suzhou in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Along the way, I looked out the ship's window, and the towns I passed had been half turned into scorched earth. Silently, I let the fire of hatred burn in my heart, and I also worried about my hometown.</p>
<p>——My hometown is probably already scorched earth, right?</p>
<p>I guessed sadly. But I immediately blamed myself for not thinking like this. So much of our land has been occupied, and tens of millions of compatriots have lost their lives, property, and freedom. I cannot selfishly hope that my hometown survives alone, and I cannot selfishly begrudge my hometown.</p>
<p>On the way to Suzhou, I was inspected five times. During the five inspections, I used all my strength to suppress my anger. The anger burned my dizzy head even dizzier, and my body was as weak as if I had a serious illness.</p>
<p>After spending a night in Suzhou, I took a ship to my hometown.</p>
<p>When I saw my hometown from afar, a chaotic emotion that was neither sad nor happy disturbed my mind.</p>
<p>Stepping on my homeland, I felt that my hometown, although not having experienced a major disaster, had changed under oppression.</p>
<p>After meeting my father and younger brother in surprise, my heart felt as light as a lead weight had been dropped. With the heart of seeing each other again in another life, we told each other everything about our love during this great calamity for more than a year.</p>
<p>After the excitement, my sick body became like a bow that had lost its string, slack and powerless! I stole a glance at my father's face, and my father looked much older in this year!</p>
