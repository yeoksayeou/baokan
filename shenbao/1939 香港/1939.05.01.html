<h3>日本××中國的幌子</h3>
<p>— 洛前</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>蔣委員長最近在駁斥近衛聲明中關於「共同防共」一項，曾經說過這樣透澈　話：</p>
<p>「所謂　同防共，是要中國和他締結防共協定，」是要在華北駐兵，劃內蒙為防共特別區。……我們可以　日本不過要以共同防共的名義，首先控制我國的軍事，進而控制我國政洽，文化，以至外交。……世上一般輿論，或者以為日本之所謂防共，其眞意在防蘇俄，實　日本所　締結協定，目的不在防共，也不在防俄，而實在借此名義以亡華，卽使有對俄的意味在內，也祇佔一小部分，而其大部份則在於滅華。」</p>
<p>蔣委員長關於日×所謂「共同防共」的眞實內容卽是滅亡中國的指明，是完全正確的，事實上，日×歷年來把中華民挨與中國人民的一切民族的與人民的解放門爭，都目為「赤化」運動，他的所謂『防共」卽是防止一切民族的與人民的解放鬥爭，日如一九二五年至一九二七年第一次大革命時，日×曾在「共同　共」的名義之下進攻當時中國的國民革命，大革命失敗後，日×在「共同防共』的名義之下佔領東四省，進攻上海，成立偽冀東『防共」自治政府，實現『華北特殊化」，鎭壓中國一切民族的興人民的革命運動，同德意締訂「共同防共協定」加緊侵掠中國。一九三七年　溝橋事變後，日×在『共同防共」的名義不展開了對於中國本部大規模的軍事侵掠行動。幾年來日×滅亡中國的具體經過，已經充分證明了「共同　防共』卽是「滅亡中國』的眞理。關的這一眞理×。再不容許任何人，任何黨派，對日×「共同防共」的眞實內容有任何曲解與幻想。為了反對日×滅亡中國，堅持抗戰到最後勝利，全民族與全國民人必須一致奮起撕破日×這一滅亡中國的「共同防共』的幌子。</p>
<p>旣然「共同防共」的眞　內容卽是滅廣中國，那末必然的結論應該是；一切參加日×所標榜的『共同防共」的人們與黨派，實際上都是日×滅亡中國的同謀者與帮兇，注精衛在，卽公開發表宜言，贊成日×「共同防共」的主張。汪精衛及其黨　們現在到處散佈謠言，說他們是　成日×的「共同防共」，不贊成滅亡中國。然而事實上，當汪精衛輩贊成日×「共同防共」之日；。國民黨中央永遠開除汪精衛黨籍的决議　及全國將領與全國人民致要求聲討汪精衛的提議，顯然也是因為他們了解　汪精衛輩之所謂「共同防共」不過是他們贊助日×滅亡中國的代名詞。這樣了解顯然　完全正確的。</p>
<p>其實，自中國共產黨誕生以來，在中國革命史上　　　數次的論明，一切參加「共同防共」的人們與　　　　有意無意地起着日×滅亡中國的同謀者與幫　的作用，抗戰十力個月的經過，更淸楚的指出了這　　　的　　　。現在誰都可以看到一切違反民族利　　　好，團　，託洛茨某奸徒們，沒有不是以「共　　　甚　　子，進行他們叛國賣國的罪惡行為的。　　　　　，中共已經不止一次的在全民族全國人　　　　　　呼　　的，現在這一眞理，應該成為全民竊　全國人民們公認的　理了。我　再不容許任何人　　　　　，在「共同防共」的幌子之下，進行叛國費團的漢好　　，這是反對日×滅亡中國，堅持抗戰　　發緊　　　要　件。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>現在我們進一步要問：為什麼日×一定要以「共　　共」作為他滅亡中國的幌子呢？。所以日×標榜「共同防其」，正是為得要給中國共產黨這一偉大力量以直接的打擊，而同時正是為得要欺縣興推動中華民族與中國人民中一部分娛解共產黨與仇視共產黨的分子參加『共同防共」，以達到它「以華制華』，分裂中國內部團結，以滅亡中國的目的。</p>
<p>其次，因為中國一切抗日救國的生動的，進步的，革命的力量，不論那一階層與黨派，必然要同井產黨一起去完成民族解放的事業，而共產黨為了完成最後解放中華民族與中國人民的使命，也必須同一切這些力量親密合作。所以，日×標榜「共同防共」同時卽是為了打擊全國同共產黨聯合的一切抗日救國的生動的，進步的，革命的力量，它在過去大革命時代，在今天民族抗戰的時代，都是企圖拿這一幌子打擊國民黨，三民主義，孫中山先生，蔣介石先生以及一切抗日救國的革命志士與政治派別的。讀者只要要看一下最近×國議曾內關於三民主我的解釋，卽可瞭然日×消滅三民主義的主張，也話以「防共』為藉口的。×文相荒木公開說，「三民主義表面上與事實上為共產主主義無疑，故日本應努力敎育中國人民以消滅之」。（一月二十二日東京電）此外，日×漢奸對於蔣委員長也不是到處散佈謠言，說蔣委　長「投降第三國際」，『投降共產黨」，「精神蒙難』，「赤化了」，因此提出了『防共」必須消滅「蔣政權」，「防共』必須「滅黨」的口號嗎？</p>
<p>第三，因為在這一幌子之下，日×可以得到國際一切反共力量的援助，並且使它更能因此而比較順利地獨佔中國。首先是德意法西期國家，是它的最親近的「共同防共」的同盟者，這些國家，也和日本一樣，在「共同防共」的幌子之下</p>
<p>其實，就使中國沒有共產黨，日本帝國主義就不會侵掠中國了嗎？絕對不會的，從日德意一防共協定」卽可看出，凡日德意三個法西斯國家所要侵掠的打擊的，消滅的對象，均屬於「共』，所以必須「防」！阿比西尼亞不是沒有共產黨嗎？然而意大利不是在「防共」的藉口下侵佔了它嗎？德意法西斯蒂不是正在「防共』的口口下要求非洲的殖民地嗎？然而那　也沒有共產黨—日本過去侵掠了中國許多地方，然而那時中國根本還沒有共產黨。所以誰也不要以為如果中國沒有共產黨，日本就不會侵略中國—這種×頭或者是小孩子們天眞的糊塗的幻想，或者是×探漢奸們為了「共同防共」滅亡中國所有意散佈的烟幕！</p>
<p>有着上述三個主要原因，所以日×拿「共同防共」作為滅亡中國的幌子。關於這些原因，中共在全民埃與全國人民的前面，也曾經不止一次的指明過這些原因，現在應該為全民族與全國人民所一致了解了。</p>
<p>因此，我們始終堅持要以拯救中國的抗日民族統一戰綫，去對抗日×滅亡中國的防共統一戰綫以國際的和平陣綫，去對抗日德意「共同防共」的侵略陣綫，這是我們反對日×滅亡中國堅持抗戰到最後勝利的基本任務。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>但是上述的一切，今天是否已經為每一個中國人與黨派所　得了呢？我們現在邊不能肯定的答覆這個問題。事實證明，除漢奸賣國賊外，即在抗日營壘內，也還有一部分人還沒有或不願了解到上述淺顯的道理。有些如張君勵之流，過去在汪精衛尙未××××××××，同注精衛勾結拉攏，秉承汪精衛的意志，公開致書毛澤東同志，發表他「共同防共」的具　辦法，而在汪精衛××××××之後，他們一方面旣未公開退出抗日陣綫，走向漢好集團，而另方面也未公開反對過注精衛，承認過他們過去擁汪的錯誤，放棄他們自己的「防共』主張，這些人至今還不願意了解我們上述的淺顯道理的，他們大概將在抗日陣綫中繼續他們「防共」的陰謀活動。還有一些不明大義的頑固分子與落後份子，他們在主觀上也許並不贊成日××滅亡中國，甚全他們中還有眞心擁護蔣委員長抗戰國策的，然而由於他們的派別成見，由於他們的權利思想，由於他們的黑暗與無知，以及由於他們對中共的不了解，與無根據的恐怖，他們今天的行動方針不是一抗鋤奸奸』，而是一防去抗日」，他們意錯把「防共」作了他們的中心任務，還有一部分則以『抗日』與「防共」並列，以『防共抗日」作為他們兩位一體的任務。這些人也至今還沒有了解我們上述的淺顯這理的，抗日營疊中這兩數分子的存在，對於堅持抗戰到股後勝利實是莫大的陣礙，因為他們的「防共」工作，不論他們主觀上的願望如何，不論他們口頭上說得怎樣好總，不論他們自以為是在擁護領袖與政府。擁護三民主義與國民黨，而實際上他們都有意無意的帮助了日×，做了日×『共同防共」滅亡中國的帮凶與爪牙。而日×更是有意識的有計劃的慫恿他們，挑撥他們，使他們自覺的或不自覺的落進日×「共同防共」滅亡中國的泥坑中去，從他們中間不斷的招收一些無恥的漢奸做他們滅亡中國的工具與走卒。</p>
<p>因此，對於張君勱一流人，我們應該要求他們公開表示他們對於堅持抗戰國策的態度，公開批評他們過去擁汪的錯誤，公開表示與汪精衛輩××××脫離一切關係一，並在實際行動上表示他們對於民族國家的忠誠，以洗刷他們在政治生命上的罪惡。</p>
<p>對於頑固分子與落後分子，我們應該以嚴正的態度，忠告他們，使他們懂得日×「共同防共』的眞實內容，千萬不要上日×的鈎子，使他們認淸共產黨不是他們的敵人，而是他們的朋友，我們應該向他們指出他們的「防共」工作的危險性；警告他們，如果他們繼讀在「防共」的道路上發展下去，不論他們屯觀的願望如何，他們必然要走進日×「共同防共」的泥坑中去，而成為日×的工具與走卒，××汪精衛的發展道路，就是最好的活榜樣。也許他們今天還以為他們的「防共」是為了擁護　袖　政府，擁護三民主義與國民黨，然而我們要預先告訴他們，他們在實際上，正是在反對堅持抗戰的領袖，反對三民主義與國民黨。</p>
<p>在我們誠懇的要求一切有良心的中國人全體一致的抗戰建國高於一切的原則下，鞏固抗日民族統一戰綫，鞏固國共兩黨的長明合作，以盼碎滅日×亡中國的「共同防共」的毒計。</p>
<p>四、</p>
<p>最後，我們還要問：何以汪精衛在接受日×『共同防共」的條件時，提出如下的「共同防共」的具體　法呢？他在去年十二月二十九日給國民黨中央的電報中說：</p>
<p>「中國共產黨人旣聲明願為三民主義之實現而奮鬥，則應卽澈底拋棄其組織及宜傳，並取消其邊區政府及軍隊的特殊組織。」</p>
<p>汪精衛這種主張，正與擁汪健將張君勱在『致毛澤東先生一封公開信」（見「再生」第十期）中所說的完全一致，汪精衛因為被國民黨中央永遠開除了黨籍無人為之宜傳，然而受汪精衛指使，同汪精衛主張完全一致的張君　的「信』，則在許多報紙上互相轉載，廣為散佈，以『共同防共』為專門職業的葉　，物寧輩所　的「抗戰興文化」更將之登在第一篇（見「抗戰與文化」第三卷第二期），此中原因何在，在明眼人看來，實在是不難明白的。</p>
<p>究竟為什麼××汪精衛之流這樣堅决的主張要井產黨「澈底拋葉其組織興宜傳』呢？這理由我們在前面說到日×何故要以「共同防共」作為滅亡中國的幌子時，已經解釋過他自然要這樣主張，而且必須這樣主張，也只能這樣主張，</p>
<p>全國人民對於××汪精衛之流的這種主張，當然决不會贊成的。因為中國共產黨今天為了中華民族與中國人民的解放事業而艱苦奮鬥的業績，是誰也不能否認的，因為中國共產黨的馬克思列寧主義，今天給中華民族與中國人民的解放事業指出正正確的具體的道路與方法，也是誰都可以看到的。所以「取消共產黨的組織與宜傳』，只對於日×有利，而對於中華民族與中國人民是不利的。</p>
<p>××汪精衛之流不斷宜傳，似乎說，要中國「統一』，就應該取消共產黨，要「實現三民主義」，就應該取消馬克思列寧主義。在××汪精衛等所要實現的『統一』，所要實現的『三民主義』中，共產黨的組織及宜傳當然應該「澈底取消」，因為汪精衛今天所主張的「統一』就是要把中國『統一於日本帝國主義，汪精衛所要實現的「三民主義』卽是×相荒木所謂『修改三民主義」，即擁護日×滅亡中國的偽「三民主義』。但是中國的眞正統一，眞正實現三民主義，在中國的具體塺史條件下，就必須要有中國共產黨與它的馬克思列寧主義。孫中山先生的偉大，也就在它能够　澈的看到這眞理，歷史也是這樣證明的，過去中國的不統一，三民主義不能實現，不是因為有了共產黨，有了馬克思列寧主義，事實證明，第一次大革命的勝利，正是因為國共兩黨的親密合作，由於，如果當時不上日×「共同防共」的毒計，中國今天早已眞正的統一。眞正的實行三民主義了。中國今天所以能够得到全國精誠團結堅持抗戰的勝利，也正是因為國共兩黨的合作現在如果全國上下再不上日×「共同防共」的毒計，中國就一定能够實現眞正的統一與眞正的三民主義。事實也證明，國民黨在改組以前奮鬥了將近四十年，當時并沒有共產黨及馬克思列寗主義的存在，然而它并沒有統一中國，并沒有實現三民主義。大革命失敗後，共產黨完全處在被壓迫的無權的地位，馬克思列寗主義的宜　受到嚴厲的禁止，然而國民黨也沒有統一中國，實現三民主義。</p>
<p>中國有些人當常空洞的擁護「統一」，以為中國只要有一個萬，一個主義，中國就算「統一』了，其實這是一種完全錯誤的思想。這叫做皮相之見，是二種不合實際的錯誤。因為中國的眞正統一，只有眞正實現三民主義之後，面容　各革命黨派與民衆團體的自由存在與發展，正是民　主義的主要內容。沒有民　主義民生主義的實行，我們應該公開的說，中國的統一是不可能的，我們為了求得中國的真正統一，必須堅決反對任何人把三民主義閹割爲一民主義的錯誤思想。而中國共產黨人對于這種真正的三民主義的真正擁護，中共以堅決的信念與熱忱去擁護三民主義，並要同一切污　與曲解三民主義的人物與黨民做無情的鬥爭。不加以誠意的實際的接受，則眞正三民主義的實現是不可能的。至於有人企圖以高喊「擁護三民主義」，作為反對共產黨興馬克思列寧主義的「共同防共』的幌子，那這些人的前送，必然是汪精衛今天所走的道路，我們要向全國人民大聲疾呼，孫中山先生的三民主義决不能成為『共同防共」的幌子，，孫中山先生的三民主義决不能支解閹割，孫中山先生的三民主義，今天必須從空洞的叫喊成為具體的實際！</p>
<p>所以中共產黨對於××汪精衛之流根據日×」共同防共「的意」而提出的「激底拋棄其組織及宜傳」的要求，只有堅决拒絕。中國共產黨向全世界全國人民公開宜言，他絕不準備在任何時候任何條件之下，取消它在政治上組織上的獨立性。為了中國的統二，為了三民主義的實現，為了全民族與全國人民的最後解放，過去如此，現在如此，將來也是如此。</p>
<p>其次，究竟××汪精衛之流為什麼這樣堅决的主張要共產黨「取消其邊區政府及軍隊之特殊組織」呢？這理由也是非常簡單的。因為陝甘寗邊區政府及八路軍，新四軍都是堅决抗日，眞正實行三民主義，為建立統一的新中國而忠誠奮鬥的力量。這是日×所不喜歡的，當然也是××汪精衛之流所反對的。</p>
<p>陝甘寗邊區政府今天是不是國民政府的一個組成部份呢，當然是的，中央政府興邊區政府的對立早已取消，中央政府與邊區政府的關係已經恢復了常態，中央政府口頭上實際上早已承認了邊區政府，今天所缺乏的，只是中央政府還沒有正式公佈承認邊區政府的一紙命令而已。這當然是一個容易為漢奸們所利用來進行挑撥離間的空子，這個空子，我們認為是必須塡補的。并且應該迅連塡補。</p>
<p>但我們并不否認邊區政府同中國其他地方政府比較起來有許多不同之點。這些不同點也許就是人們認為邊區政府「特殊』的基本原因吧？但是『特殊』也有各種各樣的特殊。大體說來可分三種，第一種號召「共同防共」滅亡中國的「特殊」，第二種沒有實行三民主義的「特殊」第三種堅决實行了三民主義的「特殊」，第一種存于淪陷區，現在不去說它，第二第三種存于抗戰區城，今天應　討論一番。</p>
<p>邊區政府的「特殊」「究竟是那一種特殊呢　我們不應該一般的反對「特殊」，而應該其體考察一下，究竟陝甘寗邊區政府的「特殊』是什麼樣的「特殊』，這是每一個有　腦的能思想的人，解决在何具體問題時所必然應該採取的正當態度。</p>
<p>陝甘寗邊區的「特」，究竟在什麼地方呢！一句話說來，就是它眞正實行了三民主義。陝甘寗邊區，不但堅决實行了爭取民族獨立主義，而且它又同樣堅决的實行了民權主義與民生主義。過去早就是這樣，現在更加是價樣，自全國抗戰發動以來，邊區在實行民族主義方面的「特殊」已經在全國堅持　戰中基本上成為『普通」了。然而在實行民主主義　民權主義方面，邊區政府還是基本上保持着它的「特殊」，而且因此也使民族主義還保存着許多『特殊」。邊區政府還是基本上已經實現了孫中山先生的民權主義與民生主義，而在他的省區在民權主義方面還只是在開始實現在民生主義方面大部分還沒有有開始。這是因為其他省區沒有實現民權主義民生主義的「特殊」的存在，所以映出了邊區政府實行了民權主義民生主義的「特殊」，這種特殊當然是好的「特殊』，是應該保存與發揚的「特殊』，而不是應該取消的「特殊」，因為我們今天所要建設的，正是三民主義的新中國，陝甘寧邊區今天的「特殊」只不過是三民主義新中國的雛形而已。只要三民主義的新中國建立成功時，卽在全中國實行三民主義與沒有了現在未行實特殊的狀態峙，則陝甘寗邊區的「特殊』也就成為「普通了」，這是取消邊區「特殊』的唯一正確的道路與方法，捨此决無第二方法。</p>
<p>我們成懇的希望一切眞心願意為建立三民主義新中國　奮鬥的人們與黨派，决不要滿足於中國的現狀。中國今天雖是在堅决實行抗戰的民族主義，然而　開三民主義的全部實行還是很遠。中國今天一切都在迅速的變化着，進步着。舊中國正在讓位給新中國，舊制度，舊法律，正在為新制度新法律所代替，只有孫中川先生的眞正的三民主義的理想，才能成為測量今天一切人物，制度，法律的好壞的最高標，準而决定其取捨。比如根據今天的舊標準看來，某些寶國求榮，貧　腐化，消極怠工，寡廉　恥，喪心病在，口是心非的壞人，可以不受到任何法律制裁而養尊處優逍遙自在，然而根據三民主義的最高標準看來，則這批混蛋至少要把他們禁閉起來，比如拿今天的舊標準看來某種制度是不合法的然而根據三民主義的最高標準看來，這種制度却正是合法的，也只有把三民主義的理想成爲我們測量一切人物，制度，法律的最高標凖，才算真正把三民主義變成了「中華民國國立的最高原則』。今天全國人民與各黨派共同建國的任務，也正是在根據於三民主義的最高原則把舊的改造為新的，把落後的提高到先進的，而不是把新的退化為舊的，把先進的去遷就落後的，不然共同建國的號召就是空談，而三民主義的眞正實現，也就不可能。</p>
<p>所以如果大家，眞能把三民主義成為中華民國立國的最高原則，則對於邊區的這種實現了三民主義的先進的特殊不但不應該反對，而且是應該歡迎效汰的了。在抗戰建國中的中國，今天正要來一個全國根據三民主義的最高的原則「力求進步」的大競賽，誰能最先實行三民主義，誰就應當得到光榮的獎勵。只有這樣，才能在全國鼓舞起為實現三民主義而共同奮鬥的熱潮，使落後的中國迅速成為先進的三民主義的新中國！</p>
<p>所以全邊區人民與中共必須　續堅持在陝甘寧邊區已經實行了三民主義的「特殊」。這種堅持，正是為了推動全國的進步，同時也為了眞正取消日本帝國主義在中國所建立的「特殊」，以及改變雖然抗戰却沒有實行三民主義的「特殊』。而××汪精衛之所以成為漢奸，正在於他要求取消邊區政府一類進步的『特殊」大家要認淸楚，××汗精衛不是反對「一般特殊』的人，他是擁護一種亡國的特殊，反對的一種淮步的特殊的人，誰要是以為一切特殊，均應反對，因此邊區的特　，也應反對，誰就有意無意的成了汪精衛的俘虜與應聲虫，實際上幫助了日×『共同防共」滅亡中國的毒計。</p>
<p>所以今天希望中央政府趕快公佈承認邊區政府的命令，以杜絕漢奸汪精衛之流挑撥　間的機會，使邊區政府更能供默它的力量與經驗於三民主義新的中國的建設。對於汪精衛之流所提出的邊區政府應該取消已經實行的三民主義的特殊之要求，只有堅决拒絕。不取消這種「特殊」，正是因為共產黨不是在精衛式的擁護三民主義，而是眞正擁護孫中山先生的三民主義。這種眞誠擁護，而不是那些只圖升官發財的只無原則的，無廉恥的政客集團。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國勞動界擁護抗戰</h3>
<p>目前中華民族正在日××主義法西斯軍閥的武裝進攻之下，臨于存亡生死的關頭，全中華民族的兒女，不分有產者或無產者，不分農工商學兵，都已被逼而臨于屈服為奴抑抗戰求生的嚴重關頭，團結合作堅持抗戰則可獲生存獨立自由，分裂互爭則祇有死亡奴役恥辱的絕路。這是事勢如此，也是眞理所在。因此歷史賦于今日廣太勞動大眾的任務，是堅持擁護中央政府，擁護最高領袖，擁護國共合作，擁護全國團結，擁護抗戰到底，為反對日本××主義法西斯侵略軍而鬥爭，為反對日×鷹犬的漢奸賣國賊的汪××等而鬥爭，為爭取中華民族解放與爭取革命的三民主義的新中國之實現而鬥爭。</p>
<p>同樣的中國政府，中國各黨派各民族各界民眾，亦必須以大公無私的精神，以國家至上民族至上抗日第一團結第一的精神，忠誠地熱烈地團結勞動大眾，援助勞動大眾，信賴勞會大眾，共同為抗戰勝利建國成功而親密合作奮鬥到底。反轉來說？任何破壞中國勞動大眾團結的主張與活動，任何阻止中國勞動大眾參加抗戰建國工作的主張與活動，任何挑撥勞資糾紛挑撥黨派合作挑撥各界感情的主張與活動，都是違反最高領袖團結全國的意旨，違反中央政府抗戰建國的國策，與違反全民族爭求解放的要求的，我們必須用集體的堅韌的力量給予無情的打擊。近來汪精衛等一面宣傳「反共和平」。一面桃撥勞資糾紛和挑撥勞工與政府的感情，這和陰謀活動　要危害中國　立運動，也就是要危害勞動大眾抗戰求生的前途，是要　加以無情的堅韌的打擊的。</p>
<p>抗戰二十一月以來，中國勞動大衆無論正前線，在後方，在×罩蹂躪下，或在海外各地，都會不顧自己的利害，不顧身家性命，不顧威脅利誘，或參加抗戰工作，或加緊生產事業，或協助戰地服務，或推進募捐籌疑，或幫助防空防毒防制漢奸，更有參加隊伍，與×軍與偽軍與漢奸與傀儡，作最英勇敢堅韌的門爭，此種行動，不僅爲中國勞動界之光榮，亦爲中華民族偉大精神的表現。我們希望海內外各地勞動大衆，善于保持及發揚此種偉大精神，展開更英勇更堅韌的門爭。我們更希望政府當局各黨各派與社會各界領袖，認清勞動界此種衛大的力量，盡更大的努力，更廣泛的更堅決的發展全國勞動節，配合廣大的農民的力量，支持抗戰建國的大業。也又有這樣，抗戰才能獲得最後勝利，建國才能達到順利成功。不過要達到廣大勞動界與農民的總動員，我們還要遵照中山先生遺留給我們的偉大的援助農工政策，我們邊要遵照最高領袖　次訓詞和中央歷次次　，而儘速頒佈與價施合理的勞動法及工廠法法救濟、組織、與訓練廣大的失業工友和流亡工友，保障勞動者最低限度的生活條件，給予勞動者以適當的體育運動的時間，和受教育，享娛樂的機會。特別重要的是要加緊掃除工人文盲，加緊教育工人識字讀報，因為只有工人獲得合理的生活，獲得必要的組織與訓練，才能提高其生產效率，才能更切實更廣大地支持抗戰建國大業，而保　中華民族的解放與三民主義的實現。</p>

<h3>慰勞巡視團在晉西北戰場（下）</h3>
<p>— 繼昌</p>
<p>又如在×××軍董師××團的全部聯歡會上，育人懷　抗戰勝和後國內戰爭有再起的可能，經過熱烈的討論後，大家意見全　一致，都認為國內不會再有分裂，國共合作是長期的，不獨要共同抗日，而且要共同建國，其他各部隊更提出許多意見，如×偽軍工作的重要性，組織民眾及訓練農村全部之迫切，有的部隊承認自己的不進步，希望得到各方的帮助；有的部隊承認與友軍協作的不够，甚至發生磨擦，在慚愧之餘，表示願意盡力改正。聯歡會常常延長至四五個鐘頭，由自我介紹方式，使得賓主上下，都一點　罰也沒有。慰勞團的慰勞品因為物萬環境的困難，不能丰富，因此慰勞的意義，是精神電于物質。說到這裏，那麼最能代表精神上慰勞意義的是贈獻國旗了。毛支隊長說：「這是第一次對我們的慰勞」；其他各部隊也莫不對獻旗這件事認為極隆重的一件事，確實的在游擊戰場上，看到了祖國的國旗，是有意想不到的快樂的。</p>
<p>這次慰勞巡視最大的收穫有兩點：第一是　後方的溝通，算二是改　了駐軍和地方機關團體及民眾的關係。</p>
<p>西北是國防的前綫，　卽使在這個火的前綫，也就是　卽使在游擊根據地內，也有後方之分。慰勞巡視圈在情况緊急之下，出發前方，看見一般民眾的然是照常活動，前方的部隊在游擊戰鬥的生為中，更是處之泰然，這點是值得後方人們欵法的。又如××的關南游擊軍，因為軍紀的不良，一向受人指摘，經過慰勞團詳細調會，才知這這件事情的結，原在　地要糧。及部份不良份子的違犯軍紀。這種發現，可以增這軍民的五相了解，更可以提醒當局的注意和供給友軍的借鑑。又如神　的失守，客觀上是因為神池地形　壞，不易守城，可是後方的人們，不明其原因，對二十五軍部份的隊伍發生不　，經過慰勞團的　勞結果，明白了實際的情形，他們在朔縣和神池，曾親眼看見這部隊最近獲得許多的勝利品，如電線，鐵軌等物，這不但使一般人了解眞像，加張軍民開係，可且也會使後方的人們，感到無限的具奮。此外前線　缺乏的東西。後方什往不知道，經過他們的慰勞，使後方的同胞，知道如何去帮助前方部隊。晉西北大規棋的慰勞，這是第一次。經過這次慰勞之後，不但後方的工作同志，從歸來的報告中得到很多的智識和見解；前方的部隊，也開始感到他們過去文化娛樂工作的不够，並　希望這樣的慰勞團能够經常到前方去。</p>
<p>慰勞巡視團　重要的一個收穫，是改善　方的部隊和地方機關團體及羣眾的關係。因為慰勞巡　團是由山西二區各領導機開各代表合組　成的，這樣他們不但可以巡視地方機關團體，而且可以更進一步地給地方機龍團體以建　，帮功和指示駐軍和民眾的協作配合，根據慰勞團報合，除過有優良傳統的×路軍毛文隊以外，决死×　隊游擊×團也能和　方組織發生密切聯系。民運工作良好，駐在之地都有羣眾代為放哨此外享　的地方工作同志，也能够配台駐軍展開×偽軍工作。駐縣鐵　以東，仍有工作同志，在×區艱苦地工作。但是好些抗日的部隊，在這種關係上，表現的還不十分够，因之造成軍民軍政的某種　閡，慰勞團能够用設服和解釋的方式，改善並加強了軍政軍民的關係，比如寧武失守後，一般羣眾不明瞭　的戰略和　術，把失　的責任。推在騎×軍身上，慰勞　能够帮幼地方工作，向羣眾解釋這事件。軍武失守後，駐軍未通知地方工作同芯，先下退下，地方工作同志，因不知消息，仍留在前邊，因　發牛了小損失，這　慰團委曲的向駐軍建隊後，該軍深感前非，立卽下令所屬各部，切實保護地方工作同志。神池的地方政府駐在南山一帶，駐軍三十五軍駐在北山，連糸上非常不够，×人退出了神池，政府不管，留得一坐空城，變成了漢奸流氓活動的地方，所這憾的是地方政府，不能完全接受建議，因之各種機關不能完全改善。</p>
<p>除此以外，慰勞巡視團在五十餘天工作中，發現了許多可注意的事情，現在提出幾件特別重要的，以供地方當局及全國人士的參考。</p>
<p>一，在×區內×人欵騙的宜傳品甚多，而我們的宜傳品反較少，希望後方能大量運輸，送印刷宜傳品到前綫和×區去。</p>
<p>二，朔縣河曲寧武一帶有所謂「××××隊」者，常有土匪行為，又有某些不良部隊的逃故變成土匪，騷擾人民，希望當局設法　正之。</p>
<p>三，偏關河曲產糧本少，而駐軍甚多，神池朔縣的糧食較多，卻被×人以貴價收買，輸入×區，希望當局有統籌之法。</p>
<p>日本對外貿易入超增加</p>
<p>第一季較上年增五千萬　出口減少一千三百萬圓</p>
<p>【上海通訊】大陸報云、本年度第一季中、日本對除「日圈集團」以外第三國之貿易、人　超過出口甚巨、　人超　金一九九·七三七·〇〇〇元、查日本在此期間自『日圓集團』以外第三國家輸入物品、大半為重工業原料、而尤以在　前緊急局勢下製造軍火之原料為最多、一般人認此點　關重要、與上年度同期相較、出口　少一三·四七七·〇〇〇元、而入口則增加五七·三〇力〇〇〇元、　層值得加以注意、因日本　戰時狀　下、對外國輸出產物、困難益增、輕工業與小工業向為日本製造　構中之特色、而其輸出　、亦以此佔大部份、今則因對華作戰緊急與必需時常防備任何國際間之不測、故輕工業與　工業似在迅速退讓、代而起者為重工業、尤其為軍火工業、日本出口物設法輸入在所謂「日圓區域」中之東三省與華北、　　增多、但須日本對「日圓集團」、區域　輸出、結果並不　直接獲　　幣、日本固已獲得　三省與華北之原料富源、據最後分　所得、日本獲得此等原料、大牛均以輸入同區之日貨易得之、</p>

<p>最近隨着×人加緊「掃蕩」華北，進攻大西北冒險計劃的開始，晉東南的情勢，又緊張了起來。七八十個漢奸從安陽和邢台到晉東南大事活動，×機也不斷的對着晉東南各據點偵察以及轟炸，一切都是×人進攻晉東南序幕的揭開。在四月的開頭，×人分由同蒲，正太，平漢和道淸鐵路線，抽調重兵，分途蠢動，向着我們開始進攻了。×酋杉山，首先從太原到介休，籌劃項陰謀，陂南團師長，也到了祁縣，從事指揮，於是晉東南到處燃起了烽火。</p>
<p>最先發動的，是平遙和介休×人四五千，取呼應的形勢，分若兩路向東南進犯，隨着就遭到了我們堅　的迎擊，×人竟施放大量毒瓦斯，向東南方而繼續進襲。洪洞，浮山，安澤的×人，担任着南路東犯的任務，祁縣，太谷×，担任着北路，向子洪口馬陵關移動，圖會攻沁縣和沁源，此外在正太路以南平定及和順的二三千×人，也向南開始話動，豫北，武安，涉縣，博愛，沁陽×人，也都逐漸西進，×人打算再演「囘去年春天」九路圍攻晉東南」的失敗把戰。</p>
<p>我們針對着×人的陰謀，就給了×人一個迅雷不及掩耳的全綫反攻，在四月六日，開始了行動，中條山西段，到處　着運天的號砲，我們威武的鐵烏，也振關飛到了晉南，向×人施行着猛烈的矗炸，×××軍的健兒，衛進了夏縣城，和×人打了兩天，激烈的巷戰，安邑運城夏縣聞喜境裏的大小據點，多半的被我們　兒奪囘了，同時平遙，介休和洪洞的×人，部遭到了我們致命的打擊，其他各路的×人，也都被我痛擊，不能再向前面進展，×垂涎已久的一塊　肉，不但吃不到咀裏去，還弄得鼻靑險腫，被人打據了牙齒。</p>
<p>二、粉碎×人陰謀</p>
<p>這次進政和順和遼縣的×人，多衣不蔽證，狼狽不堪，這都證明×人已致窮途沒路，同時進也是呌×人不得採取「就地取給」的原故。</p>
<p>「就地取給」，一方面　×人『以華制舉』毒辣政策的具體運用，一方面也在告訴我們，×人『三年不納糧」「皇軍不孫老百姓」的宜傳，是千眞萬確　人的鬼話。我們看看最近×人在晉南奸搶斃發的加甚，和×人在浮山進出的戰爭裏，劫走鄉民大車二百除輛，耕牛八十餘頭的事實，就可以知道一切了。此外在各地拉走了壯丁。和强迫每村抽拔壯丁入城受訓的事情，這更是令人極端痛恨的一件事情。</p>
<p>為的促進×人的崩潰，打破×人的陰謀，晉東南的　胞，遂提出空舍清野的行動和决心。所謂的「空舍」，是在×人進攻時候搶人和物，毫不遲疑的。有計劃的，搬到安全地方；「淸野」是澈底破壞　路，拆毀城堡，下留一點可以資×的東四。在晉冀察邊區，以及和順，遼縣，都激底的施行過這『空會淸野』的工作，以致×人到了，無法存站收到了制×死命的無上效果。</p>
<p>三、澈底間壁淸野</p>
<p>在這晉東南情勢緊張下晋東南的各縣區，為着做萬一的準備，提高戰爭警覺性，加緊動員，澈為粉碎×人新進攻，都在舉辦着間壁滑野工作，做的特別的底，所有居民的笨重東西，像箱櫃衣物，食糧等項，一律搬走移向政府指定的區域，移走步驟是婦女和食糧及牧畜以及城關商號貨物閑餘家俱，。最先行動自衛團隊及壯了等隨同各機關團體撤退，食物小攤指定暫留以備國軍需要，監犯　者保釋重者據地看押，間壁清野的期間久暫，確定在情勢和環境上。至於井磨碾灶等，是留在最後破　的。</p>
<p>為着認真和有秩序，特組織一檢查委員會，由縣政府，犧牲同盟會，决死隊，晉南工作團，農，工，商，靑，婦女救國會，和兒童隊等，担任委員。他們决定了，無論政府機關，民眾團體和一般的人民，都不能遲疑或敷衍應事。假設違背了公約，就要處　，這是神聖不可侵犯的公約。因為　樣，所以各縣區的工作，都做到了預定的結果，晉東南的同胞們，是這樣的决心準備迎接×人。</p>
<p>他們根據一年來的經騐經敎訓，决定了間壁淸野的工作，要做到一分鐘以前我們的軍隊，有糧食，有草料，有水渴，甚至要什麼有什　。到一分鐘以後，×人來了，什麼都找不到，為了這些，他們組織了運輸隊，担任最後撤退食物的輸送，和傷兵的搶運；還有破壞隊，担任破壞道路，以及破壞　不走的東西，因為許多笨重的東西，×人時常利用它，塡以沙上，架以鐵絲網，作翁防禦的工事。</p>
<p>四、擺下了除奸網</p>
<p>在×人新的進攻當中，除了軍事行動以外，還配合着××××××××政治陰謀。我們在捉到的幾個漢奸裏，對於這樣的鬼行動，已經知道的很清楚。所以在晉東南，現在正廣泛的展開除奸運動，他們組織了除奸隊，佈置下了除奸網，在準備淸除漢奸，因為漢奸是×人的開路先鋒，是×人軍事進攻的耳目，我們要戰勝×人，就得先努力除奸。</p>
<p>晉東南是我們抗×根據地，一年來漢好活動的結果，促進了我們積極除奸的成就，各方能互相諒解，互相帮助，叫漢奸無隙可入，無間可離，民眾除奸技術，和警覺性越發提高了。兒實們也被組織了起來，在每個村鎭的路口上執行者檢查，放哨的工作，這越發的加强了漢奸活動的困難性。</p>
<p>晋東南　上的高平，上月裏有鄉農捉獲幾起×人奸細的事情，現在又有兒童捉獲武裝漢奸兩名事情的發生。事實是這樣的，本月廿一日的那天，書村兒童在執行他們站　任務時，突有兩個穿軍服的入，要經過這個村子向北行進，這裏邊的一　入，帶有「學」字脅章，兒童看他們形跡可疑，扭獲不放，扯往村公所檢查，在村長和區長盤問的時候，漢奸竟出手槍，險出意外，結果在濟南籍的漢奸身上，搜出紅手絹一塊，　水一瓶，手槍一支，在洪洞籍的漢奸身上，提出　縣偽維持會臂章一枚，彰德府偽維持會通行證一枚，這樣的事件，不斷的在演出話二晉東南的兒童是在大人的指導下，織上了保衛奮東南的偉大任務了。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>今日話題</h3>
<p>今日何日？五月一日。偉大的網際　動節，全世界勞動界在熱烈慶祝今日。中國國內　動界也很熱屬。</p>
<p>只有日本是例外，他們從「九一八」事變，以後，一面退川維護世界和平的　　一面宣佈廢止勞動節日。我們要　　日　　　。說到勞動節，有一部份人似乎有點討厭，但是今日情勢不同了。第一，勞動界之　　的蘇聯，已經成為維持世界和平的　石了；第二，英法美等資本主義國家正在恊議和勞工之國的蘇聯合作了；第三，全世界勞動者今日的主要任務已是為反對法西斯反對侵略而鬥爭了。</p>
<p>說到中國，今日勞動界的唯一任務，就是要擁護抗戰建國，反對法西斯侵略。因為祇有這樣，才有眞正的生路，</p>
<p>在國內，改　民衆生活的呼聲隨着抗戰的爐喂而群高漲了。我們則以為空話不如實際，什麽是實際嗎？第一，勞動者要　　參加××去，要實際努力增加生　第二，政府和社毒各界領袖要鼓勵勞動力和失　勞動者××去；或者，保障他們能够自動地積　　　　生產效率！</p>
<p>不過更緊　的先决間、是要使勞工　字，使勞工　　，掃除勞工文南，這是避免一切無屑糾紛的根本辦法。</p>
<p>日本侵略者的砲火，逼着國內許多工對選到本港，我們欽佩這些工廠當局的艱苦奮鬥的精神，我們要以共息難的精神，切實合作；同時希望為避免無謂消耗。最好能努力推行勞工敎育和時事演講，使即時勢的難難，合作才有生路，</p>
<p>今日拍發英的的交　　，可以免費的，謝謝這個好例，趕快去電慰賀英國衆議院的工黨黨員阿特里氏吧！他最近呼籲「為反對法西斯反對侵略而團結」，對世界，對中國，都很有助益呢！</p>
<h3>英國積極備戰　劃分七區供應時粮食　大規模徵兵下院將討論　英德關係在審查中</h3>

<p>【路透社倫敦廿九日電】為憂慮徵兵制在北愛施行及徽兵制實施後僑英愛爾豫人之地反問題、實為凡勒拉突然展期赴美主要原因之一、但據新聞協會消息、此種憂處不久那可消除、蓋英政府亟願避免一切足以妨害英、愛關係之行動、故北愛　施徵兵問題、決定無　展延、同時關於留英愛僑問題、當局亦已規定必須在英出生及經登記者、始能參加兵役云、</p>

<h3>勞動者之熱與力　印刷工友為難童游藝籌款　電燈工友舉行國民公約宣誓</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>就以報道這二椿充溢着熱與力的事情，權當為紀念神聖的勞動節的禮物吧。</p>
<p>昨天上午九時，香港印刷工會第三特別支部中華書局歌詠隊，為兒童保育會籌款在東樂戲院舉行一個盛大的游藝會。</p>
<p>樓上樓下千來人把會場噪閙起來，</p>
<p>面　上刻劃着風霜與勞碌的痕迹的工友們，因為着了光榮而活潑的工裝，亦像年靑者同樣天眞，同樣可愛。多榮耀的工裝，它漸漸堆為更多的人所愛的制服了。</p>
<p>主席宣佈開會理由後，王孝英先生代表兒童保育會很懇切地說：「……今天在場聽到的多是上海話，眞敎人無限的感慨，上海，我住了十年的第二家鄕，願大家一齊努力打囘去！」</p>
<p>——誰會忘記了老家？會場空氣轉於嚴肅了。</p>
<p>「香港兒童保育院三院共收難童整整四百人，除少數在　牧留者外，大多數是來自武漢的。保育院雖有信給他們家裏，可是，打回頭的足足佔十分之七八。可知道他們的父母家人在××××之下，是遭遇到怎樣的命運。遺些孤兒難童　貴會熱心游藝籌款，慨然予以援手，我們是非常感激的。在火綫下飢餓飄泊的難童，還等着我們去搶救呢！願大家珍惜我們的下一代。」</p>
<p>一陣熱烈的掌聲送這位一片慈心的王女士下台，又是一陳熱烈的掌聲作游藝開始的前奏。</p>
<p>歌泳與口琴合奏之後，國防獨幕話劇「反正」拉開序幕了。</p>
<p>東北偽軍在奴隸生活中覺悟起來，廣大弟兄們的熱情終於把「服從××命令」的官長，轉變為「服從祖國」，「服從眞理」的××前鋒了。「吼」！「一×！」「反正」的急潮終於把×人趕出領土，一齊囘到東北老家去。在東北，在華北的活生生事實，全盤托出於舞台表現出來。</p>
<p>接下去的國防平劇「大戰東林寺」是適合廣大外　佬的口味。大鑼大鼔一響，京戲的裝樣做勢的舞步與雄壯喉音使人重温舊夢，懷念可愛祖國之情彌加親切。在劇情中有　吊於抗戰陣亡將士墓前之凄冷，有我軍把××××落花流水之壯烈、眞是「舊瓶裝新洒」的成功之作。全場熱烈的情緒，啟示我們除了提倡話劇之外，還須輔以改良舊劇。才能獲得更大的效果。</p>
<p>該會此次義演籌欵，牧入約有港幣六百餘元，全數充助兒童保育院。至於此次大會費用，是由該會五十九位熱心會友，你伍元。他三元，我一元凑夾的。出力又出錢，眞是慷慨，爽快的典型工友。</p>
<p>散會後，記者又乘興趕到孔聖堂參加香港電燈公司華人工游樂會的國民公約宣誓典禮去。一大羣是「精神食糧」的「製造者」，一大羣是「光明」的「統制者」；兩樣的勞工，一樣的神聖！誰說社會不是勞動者創造出來的？</p>
<p>電燈公司華工共六百多人，該會成立巳有九年的歷史。為了不忘記祖國不忘記肩膀上的責任，遂有國民公約宣誓的舉行。</p>
<p>下午一時，隆重的儀式開始了。當為前方陣亡將士及死難同胞默哀的時候，陳志堅女士唱起悲悽的追悼歌來，全場肅然，怎樣遲鈍的人，亦不能不有動於中。</p>
<p>主席是該會會長李逢亨氏。宣佈開會理由的時候，從容誠謹，流露着工人領袖的原來風度。把國民公約當衆宣讀之後，遂由工商日報總編輯李建豐先生孟視並演講。</p>
<p>廣西學生軍第一團團長林樞先生和各界賑聯會常委陸浮先生亦趕到了，主席很高興地講他們二位演講。</p>
<p>陸先生首先說明工人是民族革命鬥爭的生力軍，是抗戰中貢獻最大的階層，繼看復闡明今日宣誓要配含香港的客觀環境。</p>
<p>一，要以自力更生爭取國際的同情；二，要發動海外僑胞廣大的力量支持××，襄助建國。繼着林生先引伸一二八之役上海汽車夫阿毛，及此次武漢一老船夫，將所載×人及軍伙，固意使之沉溺毀滅，以犧牲自己性命，取得莫大的代價，從此證明工人力量之偉大。無論什麽地方，什麽樣人，都有參加××××盡忠國家的機會。深入淺川，工友們聰得很感動。</p>
<p>長虹歌詠團一連歌詠了十一支救亡歌曲，男女二部合唱，深深打動人們的心炊。</p>
<p>靑年會漫畫同志社表演話劇「淪亡以後」，成績十分美滿，該劇務主任劉一嗚，演員林賜明，羅良，李燕芳，陳桂，鄭炳基，盧山，馬奕飛，劉耀等都是愛好話劇的熱心工作者。該電燈公司工餘劇團表演話劇「撤退」會場空氣仍然緊張。</p>
<p>之後，該會國技班舉行開學禮，有國技表演，醒獅表演，直至五時始盡歡而散。在會場中賣花得欽港幣二十一元九角五分，捐助兒童保育院，由該院代表接受答謝。</p>
<p>我們的工友有的是發熱，有的是出力。是勞苦功高的一羣。</p>
<p>他們是今天社會的支持者，亦是明天社會的創造者。我們精神勞動者謹以至誠向廣大的工友們敬致民族解放的最敬禮！</p>

<h3>飛鏢場速寫　特寫</h3>
<p>在一所狹窄的前半邊舖子、門口張着「飛鏢大贈品」的白布「飛鏢」、這是舊式武俠小說中常常見着的名詞、如今却成為公開的賭博工具了、這種博器的構造、很為簡單、用一枝大如手指、長約三寸的圓木、尾巴裝上三幾根空　毛鴨毛之類、頭上加揷一管長約一寸的巨　、這就是飛　了、擲鏢的方法亦輕而易舉、在距離約五六尺遠的壁上、鑲着一幅木板、板上塗着紅黃藍白黑五種色素的小方格子、投博的人、如果你選定那一種色素、便將飛鏢向那一種色素的格子擲去、如果你的運氣好、你的手法靈、一擲便中、你押注兩銅板、連本帶利，便得着價値一角子的「紅金龍」香烟了、你如果不願意要香烟的話、他們儘可給你九個銅板、算是九折牧囘「紅金龍」的代價、</p>
<p>聞說這種賭博、是非常公道的、任何人皆可拿起「飛鏢」投擲（自然你至少要有兩個銅板押注）、所以作弊是絕對沒有、然而、你若果屢擲不中的話、當要自怨命運、自歎倒霉、你試企在派獎處的前面、你便會聽着有人在高談着某人昨天在此　了五六十塊錢、前一小時又有某人速中幾回得了百多塊錢、在那一邊却又聽有人設、「細佬」你又輸了、不要買紅、買白的罷」、及對一個傭婦裝朿的便說、「再賭三兩囘你就很容易贏囘了、你不過輸了十幾塊錢吧、怎麽你肯就此罷手、吸一根紙烟、抖抖氣、才回去呀、」像這樣的你言我語、鬥前又擠得水洩不通、生意似乎還不壞、然而、世界是世界人的世界、你的生意如眞係不壞、就有人會來問你分潤、於是使有狐假虎威之徒、來向你算數、有一個短衣裝求的擠上來看看場面、有意無意的說、「生意很不錯嗎、你們眞是大撈而特撈呢」、但他們却搖着頭說、「從前「派錢」一天不過二十塊、如今却要派上四五十多塊、還要加上租錢和夥伴的工錢以及其他種種、每天非殺上八九十塊便要蝕本、但是如何能够每天都殺得八九十塊呢、不收擋已是運氣、你還說大撈特撈」、短衣裝朿的人聽了一聲不　袖上他們所給的五塊錢鈔票、和拿起一包贈品的紅金龍、抽出一根香烟燒着、就大踏步而出、</p>
<p>雖是說不收擋已是運氣、但繼續開設的、尙　赴雲湧、對海的還不算、卽在中環、上環、東區、西區、幾個所在、開設「飛鏢大贈品」的已有七八十處、聽　牧取「派錢」的現在又想再加上三份一的數目哩、這當然是羊毛川在羊身上、關於這一點目沒有向讀者們說飛鏢是有利可圖之理、但如果你不怕輪錢、則此地正是賭客安全之所、因為旣有大贈品為非犯法的賭博之護符、又加有「派錢」的保護費、更萬無一失了、</p>

<p>傳竹升炳　調偽市長</p>
<p>竹升炳（卽羅炳）自附×後、不惜千方百計、向×献媚、企博歡心、查×軍陷大良容桂反進攻江曾數役、羅逆均有參與、並派出醜類一部協助×部進侵、故頗得×軍賞識、最近各路×軍因實力不敷、曾將廣州市×大部抽調補充、因此內部空虛、聞南侵×指揮安藤、近凝將羅逆調任偽廣州市長、負責市區冶安、羅爪牙日來巳紛紛潛到廣州、大肆活動、</p>
<p>游擊隊襲　廣雅書院</p>
<p>本市日來天氣惡劣、春雨連綿、廿七日　伏市郊之游擊隊、探悉×軍有大批軍火用品、西村廣雅書院躉存、是晚夜深一時許、乃由梁某率領、循荔枝　方面、潛過向×夜襲、月色昏暗、啣枚疾進、當抵步時、駐守書院之×軍尙懵然不覺、我游擊隊突然衝進、先將×哨兵兩名殺斃、繼續以手溜彈猛烈向書院內之×轟擊、連續發放百餘枚、並將×軍蓋搭之營幕縱火焚燒、然後收隊、</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>對美挑戰　法國影片的抬頭　成本低廉使好萊塢驚奇</h3>
<p>最近美國影片公司的當局，接到駐法辦事處職員情報，說法國影片攝製成本低廉，表示莫大驚異，據說法國影片公司經理，維持攝製一部影片成本不超過二百萬法郎的原則，以目前的匯價計算，二百萬法郞祇合美金五萬元，和好萊塢所製影片成本比較一下，相去眞不堪以道里計呢。</p>
<p>（一）意外成功</p>
<p>法國影片成本如此低廉，然而像Un　Carnet　de　BalLo　Mioche　Grane　Illusion　Ballenfna等片，在美國公映的結果，都獲得意外成功，法國製片公司更希望一九三九年度，有更多出品，渡過大西洋運往美國公映，而成本是都在美金十萬元以下的。</p>
<p>（二）費用分配</p>
<p>我們如果作進一步研究。那末成本比較最高的法國影片，也不過費二百八十萬法郎。大多數劇本的題材，是根據近代小說或故事，而劇作者所獲得的報酬，是佔成本的百分之五。就是至多十四萬法郞，一個普通的導演，報酬也是佔成本百分之五。主員要員，大溉分得百分之廿五，技術人員百分之十五，攝影場的費用將耗去幾十萬法郞，其餘是分配給書寫，配置，服裝，置景等工作人員和膠片等所費。這種分配方法，和好萊塢完全不同，技術人員的薪金，比演員多，男女明星，就是薪給最高的，和好萊塢大明星相形之下，也不知要差多少，而法國影片攝製時，各種置景的費用，却是很大，有許多影片是和法國的陸軍或海軍實行合作的。</p>
<p>（三）不拍之片</p>
<p>法國昔樂片很少，顯露女人大歌腿舞片也不多，火山　發，江海水漲，颶風，火災，冰山，河馬等一切危險事件，為了成本鉅大，所以這種影片也就完全不拍。</p>
<p>（四）對美挑戰</p>
<p>因為崇拜寫實，法國影片注意力是集中在羅曼史上面。最近在攝仿照製美國典型的鉅片，足見祇是在向好萊塢挑戰，而美國批評家也，巳明白，指出法國有若干明星是將使人驚異的。</p>
<h3>好萊塢影星　擇偶標準</h3>
<p>有個法國記者曾特往好萊塢去徵詢當地男古星們選擇對象的條件（按：這是單指容貌，身體，品性而言，其他條件如財產，職業，學問等都撇開不談）。據男星們的意見是：</p>
<p>（一）他們愛金栗色髪的女子，因這種女子大槪美麗的居多。</p>
<p>（二）他們崇拜瘦的女（子當然不是指骨瘦如柴，弱不禁風的女子），充滿曲線美，女體育家典型的女子，並非是他們理想的配偶，好萊塢有句流行的俗語道：「曲線並不是從一點全另一點最短的路程，所以這不是一條有趣的綫」這句話便十足表示出他們厭惡肌肉肥滿的程度了。</p>
<p>（三）他們愛快樂，善笑，活潑，略帶傻性的女人，因為娶了這種女予，在日常生活上能使丈夫容易得到安慰，忘却工作的辛勞，反之，若是娶了一位終日悲愁的婦人，便無異在家中安放一隻製造煩惱和悲劇的機器。</p>
<p>據女屆擇夫的意見是：</p>
<p>（一）她們愛嫁給棕色髮的男性，因為美國大多數男性的頭髮却是棕色的。黑色和深色頭髮的男性不能受她們的歡迎，因為太深色的頭髮，使人面部顯出不温柔的樣子。</p>
<p>（二）她們愛長脚淸瘦的男子。</p>
<p>（三）她們愛態度自然，不受拘朿，善說笑話，含有英雄氣慨的男子，沉默寡言，英國紳士派的男人，是她們認為最無味的東西。</p>

<h3>丈夫，妻子，朋友</h3>
<p>二十世紀福斯公司出品</p>
<p>主演者</p>
<p>陶麗絲—洛麗泰楊</p>
<p>里奧拿—華納斐士</p>
<p>許哥—西撒羅密羅</p>
<p>里奥拿的嘴唇急急離開酒杯，側着耳作門邊傾聽，微弱地聽得房間的另一頭陶耀絲在「咪咪咪——。」的唱歌。</p>
<p>他背脊上感覺一陣寒冷，像是吹上了一陣冷風。地板上的波斯地毯在他足下也像變成了雪堆，他的烏黑而有力的臉上，露出了疑慮。</p>
<p>白萊也聽見了，他搖着他的白髮的頭頗把鼻嗤了一下，飮掉杯中的酒咕嚕道：「白萊家族中不幸！我知道的！我的孩子，今晚實在不應去看歌劇。我明白那又重新開始了，可咒詛的事又產生了！」</p>
<p>『但是，』里奧拿囘答：「陶麗絲並不眞要幹唱歌的行業。當我們結婚了，我簡單地對她說再要這樣下去她簡直會發痴的，她立刻就拋棄了她自己的主見，這已是五年前的事。一直到現在她從未說起過。」他又疑惑的加上說道：「當然我並沒有向她要過確定的允路。」</p>
<p>白萊又嗤鼻一下，他覺得自己是陶麗絲的父親，對於女兒的性格是非常明瞭。他問道，「你為什麽不叫她努力依她的志願前進，成功一個主唱者？」</p>
<p>里奧拿支吾地答道：『我有我的理由。』</p>
<p>「我懂了，」白萊鄭重的說，接着便嘆息一聲。「一八六〇那年，陶麗絲的祖母逃出家庭到佛　尼的舞台上去歌唱，那是南北戰爭的結果，陶麗絲的母親在二十七年中每年想成一歌劇主唱者。二十七個冬天她祖了禮堂在那裏唱——只有她自已一人，現在陶麗絲也這樣了</p>
<p>里奧拿不作聲，苦惱地燃上一支紙烟。</p>
<p>白萊又說：『我想她的歌聲不是世界上頂壞的吧！在禮拜常或客廳中唱唱是够好的了，但是要上音樂會或者歌劇台——咦太笑話！』他向里奧拿窺了一眼，「這一點你也知道，我也知道，而且每個人都知道，只有白萊家中的婦人們不知道。音樂在這家庭中有着的特殊傳統，對於陶麗絲的母親很是不幸，第二十七年的失敗我想總能做過結朿了。我吿訴你，第一次我聽見女兒練習唱歌，我立刻就跑到俱樂部去鎖了門躱在房間內五天不吃東西！」</p>
<p>『咪咪咪咪……！』陶麗絲的歌聲從遠處傳來。</p>
<p>接着是房門一響，密昔司白萊的聲音說道，『美麗呵，我愛！』雖是那樣心急口快的。白萊還不及放下酒杯，裝出沒有喝洒的樣子，她已走進來，一看見便露川怒容，說聲晚安出去了。</p>
<p>白萊夫婦倆的家，在社會上很有地位，當陶麗絲和里奧拿結婚時，她氣得發瘋，里奥　雖是一個成功的承造房者，却只不過是這麽一個普通商人了，小夫妻兩人確是熱烈的相愛，但這對於世界的光榮有什麼用處呢？</p>
<p>深愛丈夫的陶麗絲常說笑里奧拿的祖先們沒有怎樣的光榮，他也酷肖他們。她坐在化耕室的鏡前，手中拿着一隻藍色的拖鞋，說話時裝着姿勢。她的白色晚服還未脫去，更顯出她潔白的肩色和明亮的金髪來，里奧拿說她是書中美人，他這樣說，「聽呵，你的眼睛，比你的耳環上實石還藍呢！」</p>

<h3>普及學校體育　應該增設普及班</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>關于香港的學校體育，因為環境的的係，場地的問題，所以都令到學校體育的發展，發生了很大的障碍，尤其在祖國發動抗戰之後，各學子為謀安全求學起見，遂蜂擁地來港，因此香港的學生突增，每一學校每個班級致有無法收容的數量，大家想想，眾多的學生，怎能在一個細小的場地裏，得利共同活潑的去運動呢，更因環境的關係很多學校已經趨向于器械的運動，這運動雖然是好，但有很多學子，因為體質的關係，每有不適合地方，而為教師的必不能盲目的去施行，致危害了學生的身心，又不能就合于少數學生的適應去教學，因之而在平日上課的時間，每每有很多學生，不能享受着體育訓練的利益，只有在場呆立旁觀，若比較是沽潑一點的學生，要在旁見習的時候，更會演出很多影響于授課時的秩序問題，在我本人的見解，以為要鼓勵學生平日在受課時能够努力，和補救正課時欠缺訓練的學生的話，必需增設普及班，像最近中華中學校，因感于該校學生，多是驕養弱質，在正課時，甚至很多家長也直接來向學校當　請假的，而不能享受着體育的訓練，致不適應於現在非常時期的要求，特於最近决定增設健身班，該班特地為弱質之學生而設，凡在平日受正課時，不努力于運動，或不能去受正課時的訓練者，皆要入該班受訓，這個班級，可為該校之需要而產生，該班的課程，在我個人的見解，以為最適宜的是授以活潑遊戲體操及醫療操等，是否適台，懇同志們更正，以上我說了很多似屬不關本文的話，更好像特別為某方面宣傳的樣子，不過，這是一點的事實，是實在的例子，他是將全校比較弱小，精神萎靡平日正課時，不大努力于運動的學生編成活的班級，施以適應的教材，加緊訓練，務求其全校的學生，也能够健康為上，相信在香港的學校，和該校同一樣環境的不少，且對于這種班級，實在與普及學校的體育，有很大關係，現就我本人所見到的分述如下：（一）</p>
<h3>游泳指南　胸泳（二）</h3>
<p>— 潘叢紹</p>
<p>全部動作演出之初、姿勢不是頭部露得大高、身體過度傾斜的、又是整個姿勢深沉水裏、因受水深的壓力增大、後者的呼吸更覺辛苦、兩個不良的姿勢、顯然身體浮水未能得法、多　　　　　　跟身體形成一字的樣子浮在水中、身體過露和太沉的毛病總快减少的、</p>
<p>為了胸泳的進步、繼續練習、實為必要、普　　游泳　多是自廿五公尺以至五十分尺的、從池之一端游至另一邊　、往來不斷的胸泳着、還要　　的就是轉身的方法、當身體泳達池端相距仍有　英尺左右的地方、乘着身體前進于　　的運動中、身體從　　　話、左手先觸池壁（或轉身板）、　力向右下方　云、這時候的上體已迫臨池邊、右手加在池壁的力量一到、上　翻過方向來、而足底正抵着池壁上了、一點也不容緩、利用肢體聚靠池邊、又在彎曲　的適宜姿勢中、猛以足力一抵、直仲着的身體向前衝去、這个轉身　的力量約能把身體在水中穿逾五公尺以上的距離的、胸泳轉身的姿勢是不許邢樣的、必須雙手一齊觸摸池邊、如向左轉、抵在池邊的　手就得同時再向左移、使身體更逼近池邊身體正向左方的時俟、雙足得準備貼在池邊把身體向前推進的動作了、</p>
<p>轉身的時候、正好是四肢　息的機會、特別在身體離開池邊的前進中、四技直伸、肌肉不斷的辛勞、至此休息一下、對予參加泳賽者的用處尤大、假如氣力充足的、未轉身　不必　氣、但非此中能手、轉身後在水中前進中又　六壓、會覺辛苦</p>
<p>胸泳的動作又是潛泳所需的、要想潛泳、不一定要採它的姿勢、總以胸詠的動作為最合用、關於潛冰練習法、日前已有一篇發表過了。（完）</p>

<h3>詩的發展</h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>詩人以熱烈的歌唱來迎接大時代的來臨。</p>
<p>民埃解放戰鬥的爆發，在詩人的心裏激起一個感情的潮浪；民族解放戰鬥的烽火，　鍊着詩人的筋骨，使他們漸漸克服宗派主義，個人主義的錯誤的傾向；同時民埃統一戰線的建立，羣衆運動的日漸開展，也使詩歌運動獲得發展的優秀條件，詩歌大衆化的提倡和實踐，便是詩歌向前邁步的康莊大道。</p>
<p>詩人在戰鬥中獲得了創作的新的生命，詩歌運動的蓬勃氣象是以前沒有過的，不過，我們的收穫遠不豐滿，較好的成就還有賴於詩人的不斷努力；我們的工作者還不多，詩歌動還未能充分的開展：特別是我們的運動還未和民衆生活結成一個緊密的聯系，詩人的條鍊朴生活實踐，都有加緊和加强的必要。</p>
<p>一位作者說，文藝刊物牧到的稿件，詩歌占極大的數目；但是每一份刊物都朿於詩歌占全八分一的方式，作家也因了加以拘來，詩歌便無法擴展了，這說法是有問題的，刊物收到詩歌極多，這表明詩作者擁有比較上最大的數目，但也未嘗不表明詩作者的隨便態度，不是刊物阻碍了詩歌的擴展，倒是詩作者的努力不够，要負一個最大的責任。</p>
<p>抗戰初期，詩人給戰鬥的爆發現象抓住了，幾乎不加思索，不加體驗，便把胸中的火熱的感情傾瀉在紙片上，發　吶喊的怒吼的咆哮的詩篇，這是一個浪漫主義的奔流，刺激，煽動，振奮，在抗戰初期盡了這樣的任務。詩歌是社會的產物，抗戰初期的現實，决定了當時的抗戰詩歌的『初期性』。</p>
<p>然而吶喊式的詩歌的宋流，便陷入口號化公式化的坭沼，口號標語的排列，缺少了感情的貫溶，缺少了眞實的形象，也就失了詩的生命，詩的力量，這創作的歪路，現在已經受了比論的批判，穆木天說得好：「在這個抗戰建國的期間，在情緒上必須是浪漫主義的，在認識上必須是現實主義的，一個詩人，在他自己的時代中，應當是一個浪漫主義者，而同時也應當是一個寫實主義者……一首詩裏邊，必雖有强有力的浪漫主義的感情，同時史必須有强有力的現實主義的形象。」</p>
<p>在事實上，詩人也止從吶喊的階段，走向有血有肉的抒情的道路，從組野到細緻，從感情的衝動到感情的深化人　觀念到形象，這是詩人的進步，蔣必舜的「天柱天的爭奪」和『別哭！扭斷你的顆子，』，厂民的『祭』和「路』都是鮮明的標記，所有的詩歌工作者應該一齊跑上這條路上，達到口號公式詩的完全淸算。</p>
<p>還有，詩歌運動要和民衆生活結成緊密的聯系，詩歌的發展才有更光明的前途。詩人已接受着這理論的指示，以詩歌朗讀為實踐的具體路線，一方面以詩歌的朗讀去敎育人衆，一方面在這實踐中獲得敎育，達到詩歌大衆化的完成，這種努力是値得珍視的。</p>
<p>這裏要提出一點，詩歌要能够大衆接受，不單形式要適合大衆，要能上口，要用人衆的語彙，而內容也要適合大衆，要反映大衆的生活，要把在大衆中　生過和進行着的有意義的事物作為詩的內容，叙事性的詩最受大衆的歡迎，而偉大的叙事詩的創作，正是革侖的。實向詩人提川的最高要求，那麽，抒情詩又該漸漸讓位於叙事詩了，自然，抒情詩和叙事詩，其間不是有截然的分別的。</p>
<h3>「糖果」與「皮鞭」</h3>
<p>— 殷三郎</p>
<p>據報載，法西斯主義國家是一貫用『糖菓』與『皮鞭』政策的。</p>
<p>『糖菓』與『皮鞭』兩種東西，似乎是不相對立的名詞，其實，我們把目前世界動態來觀察一下，並且還不十分健忘的話，一定會感到所謂『糖菓』與『皮鞭』，的確有十分的相連性。</p>
<p>翻開一下　半年來的報紙，就充滿了不少關於『糖菜』與「皮鞭」的偉蹟。不是嗎？東歐那些弱小的國家，像捷克，阿爾巴尼亞，西班牙等國都在『糖菓』的誘惑下遭到『皮鞭』的苦痛了。</p>
<p>法西斯主義國家憑恃自己的武噐，無日不在想東攫西奪，得到一些好處。但人類是有着天賦的機智與聰明，於是，法西斯侵略有如果正在覬覦着它的話，第一步决不至於就會　川自己的本來猙獰面目，它一定要偷襲大人欺驅小孩的故智一樣，，去把「糖莫」引　它，於是，在先就雙方訂立什麽經濟協定，軍事協定，使一個弱小的國家在彷徨瞻顧，遲疑未决的當兒，聽了非常入胃。等到第一步『糖菓』的計策已經成功，就一步步露出原來的一副獰惡柏來，及至知道上了人家的當，要想改變方針，那裏來得及，早已嘗到它最毒辣的「皮鞭』的抽撻滋味了。</p>
<p>宇宙雖大，事理則一，我們卽使近一點來看遠東的那一位法西斯盟弟吧，又何嘗不是玩着這一套的把戲呢？在「七七」事變以前，它老是一貫的把那些「中日親善」，「經濟提携」。「共存共榮」的「糖菓」來餽贈的，當時我們眞覺得有些「却之不恭，受之心痛」。</p>
<p>到現在它用着「皮鞭」加緊抽撻，暴露川原形的今天，它還在淪陷區域中照常散發那些美麗的「糖果」。什麽「建立東亞新秩序」，「復興新中國」呀，都是些大人欺騙小孩的卑劣把戲。所認為可惜的是世界上决沒有做　底的呆子，永遠來　它「糖菓」而不覺苦味的。</p>
<p>到現在，吃了它「糖菓」而受到「皮鞭」滋味的都明白過來，也緊緊地舉起手裏那條「正義的皮鞭」去抵抗侵者「無理皮鞭」的抽撻了。而且我相信在不遠將來，準有「正義皮鞭」擊碎「橫暴皮鞭」的一天！</p>
<h3>群龍底歌聲</h3>
<p>— 牆頭草</p>
<p>在沒有星斗的一個黃昏，從繁華的管弦聲裏，酒酣耳熱中，我離了無不散的筵席，踽踽地獨自來到這荒凉的角隅。</p>
<p>被幸福的人們遺棄了的，這荒凉的角隅呵！</p>
<p>凄淸地，三三兩兩的行人，幽靈似地無聲地蠕動着。</p>
<p>（遠處，黝黑的平原上，有獰猙獰應守着夜！</p>
<p>突然，一陣雄壯激昂的歌聲，自那邊一圈廣長的圍牆裏迸出，交織着憤怒和英勇。</p>
<p>我心頭　過一層陰影：</p>
<p>記起了這幽牆裏邊被鎖着的是八百條咬龍！他們有過壯列不杇的史蹟！現在，空有那如虹的豪氣，却被剝奪了自由，加上了鎖鐐！</p>
<p>他們在寂寞的日子裏蟄居着，一股愛護祖國的熱情，以及對于仇者的控訴，油然地發而為歌，播送在夜底空間。</p>
<p>哦，雄壯激昂的歌聲呵，你顫動了黑暗，顫動了宇宙！</p>
<p>我底心更不住地隨着激盪！</p>
<h3>豐川江口（續）</h3>
<p>— 杜文慧</p>
<p>突然在碧空的遠處發現有兩架塗着旭日微的敵機，向着我們的船飛過來了。首先看見它的是這些磚瓦船的主人。他是一個五十多歲的老頭子，對於在這西江上航行是很有經驗的。他是一個和善的胆怯的商人。他一看見敵機便慌得手忙脚亂地叫着：『你們快把船泊好呀！——快——點——快點呀——』夥伴們都在急把船泊好，在毫無經驗地叫囂，四面八方的奔跑着，有些從艙裏拿出他們僅有的布包甚或棉被衣服，背在肩上就往岸上跑。然而最可憐的還是那老頭子，他能够帶走的是什麽呢？這些船上的磚瓦便是他底身家性命財產的全部了。</p>
<p>他驚慌到面如土色，身體和牙關都在顫抖着。他懇求似的問我說：</p>
<p>「杜先生，怎樣辦呢？一切都完了；……如果我炸死了，你要吿訴我的家呀！……」他絕望地攤開雙手？</p>
<p>『不要怕老伯，你鎭靜點跟我來避避吧！……』我安慰着他，我拖着他底顫抖的老弱的手走上岸上。他是有點依戀着那船的。</p>
<p>堤岸上是空虛的，只有離開堤邊十丈遠的地方有一顆蟹爪花似的荔枝樹我就和他蹲在那稀疏的樹蔭下掩蔽着。這時候×機已在那船的上空盤旋了，它是在偵察這些船裝的是否軍隊呢。老頭子突然怕死起來了。他想向遠遠的村莊跑。我是知道他這種企圖的，於是，我就拔川自己的手檢來指着他，說：</p>
<p>「你不要跑，老伯！不然我　開槍打死你的！為你現在一走×機便會發現目標。……」他是更害怕了，然而他畢竟膽怯地馴服下來了。口裏不斷喃喃的說：</p>
<p>『如果我炸死了，你要吿訴我的家呀』，我覺得他有點可憐又可笑了。我不是和他一塊嗎？炸死他，我當然也不會例外的。</p>
<p>×機放下三顆黑東西。一顆落在對岸的田　，兩顆落在磚瓦船上場炸了。那老人歇斯的里地叫了一聲，可是它已給那轟炸的巨響所掩過了。沙石飛滿了兩岸和江中，其它的船都給搖擺得　斜或翻轉來了。</p>
<p>黑烟和火燄瀰漫了農空。×機盤旋了一會使向着碧靑的遠方飛去了。那老頭子底哭泣聲是淸晰可辨的。他是為了他底財產的損失而痛泣啊！敵機去了幾分鐘之後，我和那老頭子走到堤岸上去，他的眼睛是濕潤的。淚珠是掛在頰上。</p>
<p>破碎的磚瓦這裏那裏的躺滿兩岸和江中。碎船板　滿江水上，有些還噴火烟。那老頭子絕望地坐在那提岸上，直至那班夥伴們從遠遠的村莊裏地囘來時，他纔像在夢中驚醒似的叫夥伴們收拾那幾隻沒有被炸壞的木船。</p>
<p>花了整天的時間，總算把他餘剩的船修好過來了。一在黃昏的時候，我們的船在一羣好奇的農人的圍綫中漸漸在夜之黑暗中遠離這江口了。那老頭子深深地陷哀愁中。我沿途勸慰他，直至我們到達筆慶為止。</p>
<p>在肇慶那天晚上，那老頭子在半夜的時候便跳水了。當我們的夥伴發覺時，那老頭子已給混濁的西江洪流所流歿了。</p>
<p>翌日黎明，當秋陽照在七星岩上底峭壁時，我遙望著岩下那一帶枯乾的蘆葦，和幾艘打漁船的影子，我用一種苦痛的憐悔的心情去紀念着和善的阻怯的老人，我記起他曾囑咐過我：「如果我炸死了，你要吿訴我的家呀」！是的，我要吿訴他的家呀！然而老人為什麽而死的呢？我感到有點悵惘！彷彿一個人坐在五里霧中一樣，我注意着船傍的蘆葦，它上面有着一點點　味，這不是老人頰上的眼淚嗎？唔，我明白了，他是為什麽而死的！</p>
<p>（完）</p>
<h3>盧先生</h3>
<p>— 筱虛</p>
<p>盧先生又在那兒發表他的高見了，頭，來囘的搖着，額角上的靑筋突了起來：</p>
<p>『唉，現在的中國人眞槽…唔…所以我說：從十歲以上的都該死掉…是的：都該死掉…』他特意把最後一句重說一遍。頭又得意的擺了兩下。</p>
<p>『那呢？你也死掉？你多可惜呀！』有人在開玩笑的難他了。</p>
<p>『唔，那，那，那當然，讓我的孩子們活着，等他們水改　中國……』他的臉漲得更紅了。</p>
<p>「哈…可是你那兩個令媛…問人要糖的時候，那種本領不亞於以前那些善刮地皮的官僚呢！」</p>
<p>「唔鄧那」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈：」惹得哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>盧先生才不過三十多歲的年靑人，却老愛發表這種迂腐的無稽空談。有時要是同事們問他：</p>
<p>「那我們的老校長呢？也死掉？」</p>
<p>他就曾輕蔑的說：「哦！那當然！老實說：這些五六十的老頭子，都不行你看那兩個偽政府的漢奸，不儘是五六十歲的？…」</p>
<p>「可是…盧先生…你令尊大人高壽？」</p>
<p>「呵！…那…那」於是又是一陣大笑。</p>
<p>盧先生的令尊是六十多了，可是還不辭艱苦的離了家跟着政府往西去，為國家効勞；倒是盧先生自己，在政府　遷到漢口就說：</p>
<p>「唔：我該辭職了！…上海還有家眷在那兒呢…」於是他跑回來了！讓他老父親一個人留在那兒。</p>
<p>當人家說他該到內地為國効勞，和照料他老父的時候，他又要漲紅了驗囁嚅的說：</p>
<p>「唔…那…那…上海也有不少工作呢…况且…我還有家眷…」</p>
<h3>滿州的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『是誰？就是中國！』</p>
<p>幽默的開始，沉痛地結束了。</p>
<p>對於一個人說服是難的，讓生活影響是容易的，而且也是最有效的。於是，她在那暫時關於自己的房間，不安地徘徊起來。她的步子，是那麽沉重的，零亂的；好像　着她那沉重的，零亂的心思的節奏。在她　步的起落之間，是那麽不果决地　延着時間。在這單調而遲緩的動態中，好像在說，祖國，不曾是詩人所歌頌的聖　的詩篇嗎？不曾是往昔英雄，武士為了保衛而犧牲的光榮的墓地嗎？好像在說，他們就是現代的英雄和武士嗎？好像在說，難道父親就是一般入所咒駡的祖國的叛徒——他們的相反者嗎？好像在說，她在那二者之間，究竟何所去從？……擾人而忘不去的思想，是苦惱的，他一雙手握起拳頭，不住地打着另一隻手掌，她願以肉體的痛苦代替思想的煩憂，她那潔白而柔嫩的手——她全部美麗的一部份，打得她像被櫻水所染紅，但她依然舒展不了心中煩憂的摺皺，她用腳踏起地板的時候，她已經哭了，弱者的淚，是不珍貴的。</p>
<p>她的哭聲，驚了那唯一的相識者，他來看她——面愛護二面監視，他望着她那美麗的臉面，畢竟比昨夜見時憔悴了許多，但仍似一朶鮮美的花，使人愛戀，仍似使人難於相信她就是醜惡的叛徒之女，這時，　想一朶鮮美的花——　她，它的生長地，為什麽不是聖潔的品石，竟是齷齪的垃圾——她的父親。他又望着她那跳動得不勻稱的胸脯，那臉上露珠一般明晶的淚滴，他担心着像她這樣弱小的生命是經不起過大的創傷的，于是，他默默地咒麗起她的父親——祖國的叛徒，她父親的罪　，不是她的，她為什麽代替父親受累呢。難這世界上永遠存在着無辜者的不幸嗎？</p>

        <h1>1939.05.01</h1>
<h3>Japan's Pretext for Annexing China</h3>
<p>— Luo Qian</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently, in refuting Konoe's statement regarding the "joint anti-communism" clause, made the following insightful remarks:</p>
<p>"The so-called joint anti-communism means forcing China to sign an anti-communist pact," requiring the stationing of troops in North China and designating Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone... We can see that Japan merely wants to use the pretext of joint anti-communism to first control our country's military, and then control our country's politics, culture, and even diplomacy... General public opinion in the world may believe that Japan's so-called anti-communism is truly aimed at preventing Soviet Russia, but in reality, the agreements Japan seeks to conclude are not aimed at preventing communism, nor at preventing Russia, but are in fact using this pretext to subjugate China. Even if there is a meaning against Russia within it, it only occupies a small part, while the majority is aimed at destroying China."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's clear indication that the true content of Japan's so-called "joint anti-communism" is the destruction of China is entirely correct. In fact, over the years, Japan has regarded all national and people's liberation struggles of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people as "red" movements. Its so-called "anti-communism" is to prevent all national and people's liberation struggles. For example, during the First Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, Japan attacked the then Chinese National Revolution under the name of "joint anti-communism." After the failure of the Great Revolution, Japan occupied the Northeast Provinces, attacked Shanghai, established the puppet Eastern Hebei "Anti-Communist" Autonomous Government, realized the "specialization of North China," and suppressed all national and people's revolutionary movements in China under the name of "joint anti-communism." It also concluded the "Joint Anti-Comintern Pact" with Germany and Italy to intensify its aggression against China. After the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Japan launched a large-scale military invasion of mainland China under the name of "joint anti-communism." The concrete process of Japan's destruction of China over the past few years has fully proved the truth that "joint anti-communism" is "the destruction of China." Regarding this truth, no one, no party, should be allowed to have any distortion or illusion about the true content of Japan's "joint anti-communism" any longer. In order to oppose Japan's destruction of China and persist in the war of resistance until the final victory, the entire nation and all the people must rise up together to tear apart Japan's pretext of "joint anti-communism" for destroying China.</p>
<p>Since the true content of "joint anti-communism" is the destruction of China, then the inevitable conclusion should be: all people and parties participating in Japan's touted "joint anti-communism" are in fact accomplices and henchmen in Japan's destruction of China. Wang Jingwei, for example, openly issued declarations supporting Japan's "joint anti-communism" proposals. Wang Jingwei and his clique are now spreading rumors everywhere, saying that they support Japan's "joint anti-communism" but do not support the destruction of China. However, in fact, the day Wang Jingwei and his ilk supported Japan's "joint anti-communism," the Kuomintang Central Committee's resolution to permanently expel Wang Jingwei from the party and the proposal of national generals and the national people to demand the denunciation of Wang Jingwei clearly also show that they understood that Wang Jingwei's so-called "joint anti-communism" was merely a synonym for their support for Japan's destruction of China. This understanding is obviously entirely correct.</p>
<p>In fact, since the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, there have been numerous arguments in the history of the Chinese revolution proving that all people participating in "joint anti-communism" intentionally or unintentionally play the role of accomplices and henchmen in Japan's destruction of China. The course of the ten months of the War of Resistance has even more clearly pointed out this fact. Now, everyone can see that all those who violate national interests, unite with Trotskyite traitors, and carry out their treasonous and country-selling criminal acts under the banner of "anti-communism." Moreover, the CCP has more than once called on the entire nation and the national people, and now this truth should become a commonly recognized truth among the entire nation and the national people. We must no longer allow anyone to carry out traitorous activities under the pretext of "joint anti-communism." This is a critical requirement for opposing Japan's destruction of China and persisting in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Now we must further ask: Why does Japan insist on using "joint anti-communism" as its pretext for destroying China? The reason Japan touts "joint anti-communism" is precisely to directly strike a blow against the great power of the Chinese Communist Party, and at the same time to deceive and incite a segment of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people who misunderstand and hate the Communist Party to participate in "joint anti-communism," in order to achieve its goal of "using Chinese to control Chinese," splitting China's internal unity, and destroying China.</p>
<p>Secondly, because all vigorous, progressive, and revolutionary forces in China's resistance against Japan and national salvation, regardless of which class or party, must inevitably work with the Communist Party to complete the cause of national liberation, and the Communist Party, in order to complete the mission of ultimately liberating the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, must also closely cooperate with all these forces. Therefore, Japan's touting of "joint anti-communism" is also to strike at all vigorous, progressive, and revolutionary forces across the country that are united with the Communist Party in resisting Japan and saving the nation. In the past, during the era of the Great Revolution, and today, in the era of national resistance, it has always attempted to use this pretext to strike at the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, and all revolutionary patriots and political factions who resist Japan and save the nation. Readers only need to look at the recent interpretations of the Three People's Principles by Japanese parliamentarians to understand Japan's intention to eliminate the Three People's Principles, also using "anti-communism" as a pretext. Foreign Minister Arakawa publicly stated, "The Three People's Principles are undoubtedly communist in appearance and in fact, so Japan should strive to educate the Chinese people to eliminate them." (Tokyo dispatch on January 22) In addition, aren't Japanese traitors also spreading rumors everywhere about Chairman Chiang, saying that he has "surrendered to the Third International," "surrendered to the Communist Party," is "spiritually suffering," and is "red," thus proposing the slogans that "anti-communism" must eliminate the "Chiang regime" and "anti-communism" must "destroy the party"?</p>
<p>Thirdly, because under this pretext, Japan can obtain the assistance of all international anti-communist forces, and it can therefore more easily monopolize China. First of all, the fascist countries of Germany and Italy are its closest allies in "joint anti-communism." These countries, like Japan, under the banner of "joint anti-communism..."</p>
<p>In fact, even if there were no Communist Party in China, would Japanese imperialism not invade China? Absolutely not. From the "Anti-Comintern Pact" between Japan, Germany, and Italy, it can be seen that all the targets that the three fascist countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy want to invade, strike at, and eliminate belong to the "Comintern," so they must "prevent" it! Doesn't Abyssinia have a Communist Party? However, didn't Italy invade and occupy it under the pretext of "anti-communism"? Aren't German and Italian fascists demanding colonies in Africa under the pretext of "anti-communism"? However, there is no Communist Party there either—Japan has invaded many places in China in the past, but at that time, China did not have a Communist Party at all. So no one should think that if China did not have a Communist Party, Japan would not invade China—this kind of idea is either a naive and confused fantasy of children, or a smokescreen intentionally spread by spies and traitors for "joint anti-communism" and the destruction of China!</p>
<p>With the above three main reasons, Japan uses "joint anti-communism" as its pretext for destroying China. Regarding these reasons, the CCP has also pointed out these reasons more than once in front of the entire nation and the national people, and now they should be understood by the entire nation and the national people.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have always insisted on using the anti-Japanese national united front for saving China to counter Japan's anti-communist united front for destroying China, and using the international peace front to counter the aggressive front of Japan, Germany, and Italy's "joint anti-communism." This is our basic task of opposing Japan's destruction of China and persisting in the War of Resistance until the final victory.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>But has everything mentioned above been understood by every Chinese and every party today? We cannot give a definite answer to this question right now. Facts prove that, apart from traitors and national betrayers, even within the anti-Japanese camp, there are still some people who have not or are unwilling to understand the simple principles mentioned above. Some, like Zhang Junmai and his ilk, in the past, when Wang Jingwei had not yet [omission] conspired with Wang Jingwei, colluded with each other, followed Wang Jingwei's will, and openly wrote to Comrade Mao Zedong, publishing his specific methods for "joint anti-communism." After Wang Jingwei [omission], on the one hand, they neither openly withdrew from the anti-Japanese front and went to the traitorous clique, nor did they openly oppose Wang Jingwei, admit their past mistakes in supporting Wang, and abandon their own "anti-communist" proposals. These people are still unwilling to understand our above-mentioned simple principles, and they will probably continue their "anti-communist" conspiracies in the anti-Japanese front. There are also some stubborn elements and backward elements who do not understand the greater righteousness. Subjectively, they may not approve of Japan [omission] destroying China, and some of them may even sincerely support Chairman Chiang's policy of resisting Japan and saving the nation. However, due to their factional prejudices, their ideas of power, their darkness and ignorance, and their misunderstanding and unfounded terror of the CCP, their course of action today is not "anti-Japan and eliminating traitors" but "anti-communism before resisting Japan." They mistakenly regard "anti-communism" as their central task, and some even regard "resisting Japan" and "anti-communism" as parallel, with "anti-communism while resisting Japan" as their two-in-one task. These people have also not understood the simple principles mentioned above. The existence of these two types of elements in the anti-Japanese camp is a great obstacle to persisting in the war of resistance until the final victory, because their "anti-communist" work, regardless of their subjective wishes, no matter how well they speak, and no matter how much they believe they are supporting the leader and the government, and supporting the Three People's Principles and the Kuomintang, in reality, they are intentionally or unintentionally helping Japan and acting as accomplices and lackeys in Japan's "joint anti-communism" and destruction of China. And Japan is consciously and deliberately inciting them, provoking them, and causing them to consciously or unconsciously fall into the mire of Japan's "joint anti-communism" and destruction of China, constantly recruiting some shameless traitors from among them to be their tools and pawns in destroying China.</p>
<p>Therefore, for people like Zhang Junmai, we should demand that they publicly express their attitude towards adhering to the national policy of resisting Japan, openly criticize their past mistakes in supporting Wang, publicly declare that they have severed all relations with Wang Jingwei and his ilk, and express their loyalty to the nation and the country in practical actions, in order to wash away the sins in their political lives.</p>
<p>For stubborn elements and backward elements, we should advise them with a serious attitude, make them understand the true content of Japan's "joint anti-communism," and make sure they do not fall into Japan's trap. We should make them realize that the Communist Party is not their enemy, but their friend. We should point out to them the danger of their "anti-communist" work; warn them that if they continue to develop on the path of "anti-communism," regardless of their subjective wishes, they will inevitably step into the mire of Japan's "joint anti-communism" and become Japan's tools and pawns. The development path of Wang Jingwei is the best living example. Perhaps they still think today that their "anti-communism" is to support the leader and the government, and to support the Three People's Principles and the Kuomintang, but we want to tell them in advance that in reality, they are opposing the leader who insists on resisting Japan, and opposing the Three People's Principles and the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Under the principle that we sincerely demand that all conscientious Chinese people take unanimous resistance to Japan and national construction as paramount, consolidate the anti-Japanese national united front, and consolidate the long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, in order to shatter Japan's poisonous plan of destroying China through "joint anti-communism."</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Finally, we must also ask: When Wang Jingwei accepted Japan's "joint anti-communism" conditions, what specific methods of "joint anti-communism" did he propose? In his telegram to the Kuomintang Central Committee on December 29 last year, he said:</p>
<p>"Since the Chinese Communists have declared that they are willing to strive for the realization of the Three People's Principles, they should thoroughly abandon their organization and propaganda, and abolish the special organization of their border region government and army."</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's proposal is completely consistent with what Wang's henchman Zhang Junmai said in "An Open Letter to Mr. Mao Zedong" (see "Renaissance" No. 10). Because Wang Jingwei was permanently expelled from the party by the Kuomintang Central Committee, no one promoted his views. However, Zhang Junmai's "letter," which was instructed by Wang Jingwei and completely consistent with Wang Jingwei's proposals, was reprinted in many newspapers and widely distributed. Ye Qing and Wu Ning, who specialize in "joint anti-communism," even published it as the first article (see "Resistance and Culture" Vol. 3, No. 2). The reason for this, in the eyes of discerning people, is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Why exactly do Wang Jingwei and his ilk so resolutely advocate that the Communist Party "thoroughly abandon its organization and propaganda"? The reason for this, as we explained earlier when discussing why Japan wants to use "joint anti-communism" as its pretext for destroying China, is that they naturally want to advocate this, and must advocate this, and can only advocate this.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country will certainly not approve of the proposals of Wang Jingwei and his ilk, because no one can deny the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in its arduous struggle for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people today, and because everyone can see that the Marxism-Leninism of the Chinese Communist Party is pointing out the correct and concrete path and method for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people today. Therefore, "abolishing the Communist Party's organization and propaganda" is only beneficial to Japan, and not beneficial to the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and his ilk constantly promote the idea that, in order to "unify" China, the Communist Party should be abolished, and in order to "realize the Three People's Principles," Marxism-Leninism should be abolished. In the "unity" and "Three People's Principles" that Wang Jingwei and others want to realize, the Communist Party's organization and propaganda should of course be "thoroughly abolished," because the "unity" that Wang Jingwei advocates today is to "unify China under Japanese imperialism," and the "Three People's Principles" that Wang Jingwei wants to realize are the "revised Three People's Principles" that Foreign Minister Arakawa spoke of, that is, the pseudo-"Three People's Principles" that support Japan's destruction of China. But the true unification of China, the true realization of the Three People's Principles, under China's specific historical conditions, must have the Chinese Communist Party and its Marxism-Leninism. The greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen lies in his ability to clearly see this truth, and history has also proven it. In the past, China's disunity and the failure to realize the Three People's Principles were not because of the existence of the Communist Party or Marxism-Leninism. Facts prove that the victory of the First Great Revolution was precisely because of the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If it had not been for Japan's poisonous plan of "joint anti-communism" at that time, China would have already achieved true unification and truly implemented the Three People's Principles today. The reason why China can achieve the victory of national unity and perseverance in the War of Resistance today is also precisely because of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Now, if the whole country, from top to bottom, does not fall for Japan's poisonous plan of "joint anti-communism" again, China will certainly be able to achieve true unification and true Three People's Principles. Facts also prove that the Kuomintang struggled for nearly forty years before its reorganization. At that time, there was no Communist Party or the existence of Marxism-Leninism, but it did not unify China or realize the Three People's Principles. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Communist Party was completely in a state of being oppressed and powerless, and the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism was severely prohibited, but the Kuomintang did not unify China or realize the Three People's Principles either.</p>
<p>Some people in China often emptily support "unity," thinking that as long as China has one party and one doctrine, China will be "unified." In fact, this is a completely wrong idea. This is called a superficial view, and it is a kind of unrealistic error. Because the true unification of China can only be achieved after the true realization of the Three People's Principles, and allowing the free existence and development of various revolutionary parties and mass organizations is precisely the main content of democracy. Without the implementation of democracy and people's livelihood, we should openly say that the unification of China is impossible. In order to achieve the true unification of China, we must resolutely oppose anyone's erroneous idea of ​​emasculating the Three People's Principles into one principle. And the Chinese Communists sincerely support this true Three People's Principles, and the CCP will support the Three People's Principles with firm conviction and enthusiasm, and will wage a relentless struggle against all those who defile and distort the Three People's Principles. Without sincerely and practically accepting it, the realization of the true Three People's Principles is impossible. As for those who attempt to use shouting "support for the Three People's Principles" as a pretext for "joint anti-communism" against the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism, the future of these people will inevitably be the path that Wang Jingwei is taking today. We want to shout loudly to the people of the whole country that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles must not become a pretext for "joint anti-communism," Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles must not be dismembered and emasculated, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles must become concrete and practical today, not empty slogans!</p>
<p>Therefore, the CCP can only resolutely reject the demand of Wang Jingwei and his ilk, based on Japan's "joint anti-communism," to "thoroughly abandon its organization and propaganda." The Chinese Communist Party declares publicly to the world and the people of the whole country that it is absolutely not prepared to abolish its political and organizational independence at any time and under any conditions. For the unification of China, for the realization of the Three People's Principles, and for the final liberation of the entire nation and the national people, it has been so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future.</p>
<p>Secondly, why exactly do Wang Jingwei and his ilk so resolutely advocate that the Communist Party "abolish the special organization of its border region government and army"? The reason for this is also very simple, because the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are all forces that resolutely resist Japan, truly implement the Three People's Principles, and faithfully struggle for the establishment of a unified new China. This is what Japan does not like, and of course it is also what Wang Jingwei and his ilk oppose.</p>
<p>Is the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government a component of the National Government today? Of course it is. The opposition between the Central Government and the Border Region Government has long been abolished, and the relationship between the Central Government and the Border Region Government has returned to normal. The Central Government has already verbally and practically recognized the Border Region Government. What is lacking today is just a written order from the Central Government formally announcing the recognition of the Border Region Government. This is certainly an opportunity that is easily exploited by traitors to carry out instigation and discord, and we believe that this opportunity must be filled, and should be filled quickly.</p>
<p>But we do not deny that the Border Region Government has many different points compared with other local governments in China. These different points may be the basic reason why people consider the Border Region Government "special," right? But "special" also has various kinds of special. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: the first type is the "special" of "joint anti-communism" and destroying China; the second type is the "special" of not implementing the Three People's Principles; the third type is the "special" of resolutely implementing the Three People's Principles. The first type exists in the occupied areas, so we will not discuss it today. The second and third types exist in the war-resisting areas, so we should discuss them today.</p>
<p>Which kind of "special" is the "special" of the Border Region Government? We should not generally oppose "special," but should specifically investigate what kind of "special" the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government is. This is the proper attitude that everyone with a mind and capable of thinking must adopt when solving any concrete problem.</p>
<p>What exactly is the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region? In a word, it is that it truly implements the Three People's Principles. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region not only resolutely implemented the principle of striving for national independence, but it also resolutely implemented democracy and people's livelihood. It has been like this in the past, and it is even more so now. Since the launch of the nationwide War of Resistance, the "special" of the Border Region in implementing nationalism has basically become "ordinary" in the nationwide perseverance in the war. However, in terms of implementing democracy and people's rights, the Border Region Government still basically maintains its "special," and therefore also preserves many "special" in nationalism. The Border Region Government has basically realized Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of democracy and principle of people's livelihood, while in his provinces, in terms of the principle of democracy, it is only beginning to be realized, and in terms of the principle of people's livelihood, most have not even begun. This is because the "special" of other provinces not realizing democracy and people's livelihood exists, so it reflects the "special" of the Border Region Government implementing democracy and people's livelihood. This kind of special is of course a good "special," a "special" that should be preserved and promoted, not a "special" that should be abolished, because what we want to build today is a new China based on the Three People's Principles, and the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region today is just the prototype of the new China based on the Three People's Principles. As long as the new China based on the Three People's Principles is successfully established, that is, when the Three People's Principles are implemented throughout China and there is no special state of unrealization, then the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will also become "ordinary." This is the only correct path and method to abolish the "special" of the Border Region. There is no other method.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that all people and parties who are truly willing to strive for the establishment of a new China based on the Three People's Principles will never be satisfied with the status quo of China. Although China is now resolutely implementing the nationalism of the War of Resistance, it is still very far from the full implementation of the Three People's Principles. Everything in China today is changing and progressing rapidly. Old China is giving way to new China, and old systems and old laws are being replaced by new systems and new laws. Only Mr. Sun Yat-sen's true ideal of the Three People's Principles can become the highest standard for measuring the good and bad of all people, systems, and laws today, and determining their acceptance or rejection. For example, according to today's old standards, some bad people who covet national glory, are corrupt, passively work, are shameless, and are conscienceless can not be subject to any legal sanctions and can live comfortably and freely, but according to the highest standard of the Three People's Principles, then this group of bastards should at least be imprisoned. For example, according to today's old standards, a certain system is illegal, but according to the highest standard of the Three People's Principles, this system is precisely legal. Only by making the ideal of the Three People's Principles the highest standard for us to measure all people, systems, and laws can we truly make the Three People's Principles "the highest principle of the Republic of China." Today, the task of building the country together by the people of the whole country and all parties is precisely to transform the old into the new, to raise the backward to the advanced, based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles, rather than to degenerate the new into the old and to make the advanced accommodate the backward. Otherwise, the call for building the country together is empty talk, and the true realization of the Three People's Principles is impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, if everyone can truly make the Three People's Principles the highest principle of the founding of the Republic of China, then this advanced special of the Border Region, which has realized the Three People's Principles, should not only not be opposed, but should also be welcomed and emulated. In China, which is in the midst of resisting Japan and building the nation, today there is to be a great competition across the country based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles, "striving for progress." Whoever can implement the Three People's Principles first should be given glorious rewards. Only in this way can we arouse a nationwide upsurge in the common struggle for the realization of the Three People's Principles and quickly make the backward China a new China based on the advanced Three People's Principles!</p>
<p>Therefore, the people of the entire Border Region and the CCP must continue to insist on the "special" of the Three People's Principles that have already been implemented in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This insistence is precisely to promote the progress of the whole country, and at the same time to truly eliminate the "special" established by Japanese imperialism in China, and to change the "special" of those who resist Japan but have not implemented the Three People's Principles. And the reason why Wang Jingwei became a traitor is precisely because he demanded the abolition of the progressive "special" of the Border Region Government and the like. Everyone must recognize clearly that Wang Jingwei is not a person who opposes "general special." He is a person who supports a special that will destroy the country and opposes a special that promotes progress. Whoever thinks that all special should be opposed, and therefore the special of the Border Region should also be opposed, is intentionally or unintentionally becoming a prisoner of Wang Jingwei and an echo of Wang Jingwei, and is actually helping Japan's poisonous plan of "joint anti-communism" to destroy China.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, we hope that the Central Government will quickly announce the order recognizing the Border Region Government, in order to prevent the traitors and Wang Jingwei's like from instigating opportunities for discord, so that the Border Region Government can better offer its strength and experience to the construction of the new China based on the Three People's Principles. As for the demand of Wang Jingwei and his ilk that the Border Region Government should abolish the special of the Three People's Principles that have already been implemented, we can only resolutely reject it. Not abolishing this "special" is precisely because the Communist Party is not supporting the Three People's Principles in Wang Jingwei's style, but is truly supporting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. This kind of sincere support is not like those political groups who only seek to rise in rank and get rich, and who are unprincipled and shameless.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China's Labor Circles Support the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>The Chinese nation is currently facing a critical moment of survival under the armed invasion of Japanese ××ist fascist militarists. All sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, regardless of whether they are propertied or propertyless, or whether they are farmers, workers, merchants, students, or soldiers, have been forced to choose between submitting to slavery or fighting for survival. Unity and cooperation in persevering in the War of Resistance will lead to survival, independence, and freedom, while division and mutual strife will only lead to death, enslavement, and shame. This is the reality of the situation and the truth of the matter. Therefore, history has entrusted the broad laboring masses today with the task of firmly supporting the Central Government, supporting the supreme leader, supporting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, supporting national unity, and supporting the War of Resistance to the end, to fight against the invading Japanese ××ist fascist army, to fight against the Japanese ×× lackeys and traitors like Wang ××, and to fight for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the realization of a new China based on the revolutionary Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Chinese government, all Chinese parties, all nationalities, and people from all walks of life must, with a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, with a spirit of putting the nation first, the people first, resisting Japan first, and unity first, sincerely and enthusiastically unite the laboring masses, assist the laboring masses, and trust the laboring masses, and work closely together to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction. Conversely, any proposition or activity that undermines the unity of the Chinese laboring masses, any proposition or activity that prevents the Chinese laboring masses from participating in the War of Resistance and national construction, and any proposition or activity that provokes labor-capital disputes, party cooperation, or inter-group emotions, all violate the supreme leader's intention of uniting the country, violate the Central Government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, and violate the entire nation's demand for liberation. We must use our collective and tenacious strength to give them a merciless blow. Recently, Wang Jingwei and others have been promoting "anti-communism and peace" on the one hand, and on the other hand, they have been picking labor-capital disputes and provoking the feelings of workers and the government. These conspiracies are to harm China’s independent movement, which is to harm the future of the laboring masses in resisting the war for survival and must be given a merciless and tenacious blow.</p>
<p>Since the 21st month of the War of Resistance, the Chinese laboring masses, whether on the front lines, in the rear, under × cover, or overseas, have disregarded their own interests, disregarded their personal safety, disregarded threats and inducements, either participated in the War of Resistance, stepped up production, assisted in battlefield services, promoted fundraising, or helped prevent air raids, poison gas, and traitors. There are even those who have joined the ranks and engaged in the most courageous and tenacious struggles against the × army, the puppet army, the traitors, and the puppets. This kind of action is not only the glory of the Chinese labor community, but also the manifestation of the great spirit of the Chinese nation. We hope that the laboring masses at home and abroad will be good at maintaining and developing this great spirit and launch a more heroic and tenacious struggle. We also hope that government authorities, parties, factions, and leaders from all walks of life will recognize the great strength of the labor community and make greater efforts to develop the national labor force more widely and resolutely, coordinate with the strength of the vast number of farmers, and support the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation. Only in this way can the War of Resistance achieve final victory and the nation-building can achieve smooth success. However, to achieve the general mobilization of the vast labor community and farmers, we must also follow the great policy of aiding farmers and workers left to us by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We must also follow the supreme leader's successive instructions and the Central Government's successive orders, and promulgate and implement reasonable labor laws and factory laws as soon as possible to rescue, organize, and train the vast number of unemployed workers and exiled workers, protect the minimum living conditions of workers, and give workers adequate time for physical exercise, education, and entertainment. It is particularly important to step up the elimination of illiteracy among workers and to step up the education of workers to read and write, because only when workers obtain a reasonable life and obtain the necessary organization and training can they improve their production efficiency, support the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation more effectively and extensively, and protect the liberation of the Chinese nation and the realization of the Three Principles of the People.</p>

<h3>The War Situation on the Borders of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei Provinces is Tense; × Planes Flew Over Hunan and Bombed Various Places Yesterday; Our Army in Southern Shanxi Has Gained the Initiative</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing at 7:00 AM] On the morning of the 29th, the × in Zhongbutou, Xianghe River, Central Hubei, fiercely bombarded our side with six cannons, covering the infantry with 100 men to forcibly cross the river. After our fierce strafing, a fierce battle lasted for two hours, repelling the ×. On the same morning, 25 × planes in batches bombed Lengshuipu.</p>
<p>Hunan-Hubei Area</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 30th] Xishan (5 li south of Tongcheng), the × artillery position threatening my Jiuling Mountains, was bravely attacked by our army on the evening of the 29th, and after a night of assault, was completely occupied on the dawn of the 30th. Continuing to advance towards Tongcheng, it has approached the city and is fiercely attacking it. Guikou Town, 8 li from Dashaping, was also recovered on the 30th, killing more than 200 ×, capturing one mountain cannon made in the 6th year of Taisho, one heavy machine gun, more than 30 rifles, and countless other military supplies. Guikou is located on the Tongchong Highway. After our recovery, the return route of the × in Tongcheng has been cut off, and it can be used to attack the × in Chongyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 30th] A large number of × planes took advantage of the sunny weather to wreak havoc in Hunan. On the morning of the 30th, 27 × planes fled south from Hubei. At about 10:00, they arrived in Shaoyang and dropped more than 20 bombs at the east gate, then went north. Another batch of 9 × planes fled from Changde to Chenxi, dropped many bombs, and then flew away along the original route. In addition, one × plane scattered false leaflets over Changsha and Xiangtan.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] According to news from the front line yesterday afternoon, after the Chinese army captured the airfield outside Nanchang, it has attacked the railway station in the city. The two armies are now fighting in the streets. According to a telegram from Guilin, the Japanese army is attacking Mount Dashan with 5,000 troops. The Chinese army retreated to the western mountains after paying a considerable price to continue the war.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] According to a military announcement here last night, a certain unit of the 155th Division of the Chinese Army, together with a contingent of about 5,000 local militia, counterattacked Jiangmen and are now engaged in a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Shanxi Province</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 29th] The situation in Shanxi is improving. The various attacking troops are gradually gaining the initiative. The war results in southern Shanxi are particularly good. The task of attrition warfare and annihilation warfare has been achieved. The × is in a dilemma, like fish in a cauldron. Strategically, we have achieved a major victory. The offensive momentum of the × has been greatly reduced, and most of them are holding on to their strongholds and adopting a defensive posture. In the past two days, they have only used small units to make roundabout raids, so there has been no major contact. The × invading south along the Baijin Highway in southeastern Shanxi, numbering about four or five thousand, have been successively defeated to the north after several days of fierce attacks. The war in that area has subsided. The × in the Zhongyang-Fenxi area have been active in order to contain our army's eastward advance, so there have been small contacts from time to time in recent days. There has been little change in the Zhengtai and Tongpu northern sections. On the evening of the 25th, there was a fierce battle at Heilongguan all night. The × stubbornly resisted, and the battle was still going on at noon on the 26th. The × in the Anyi-Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi are attempting to counterattack, and we have been closely monitoring them. There has been no contact in Hejin, Jishan and other places.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 29th] A part of the × north of Lishi invaded Gukou Town and was defeated by us. On the 26th, more than 300 cavalry from a rapid force suddenly increased. Our troops in the north and south of Dawu ambushed in coordination on the evening of the 6th, and the battle was quite fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] More than 100 × from Beiguan invaded Hequ on the morning of the 26th. We blocked them in the Yaowangping and Changwugou areas. By night, the × had occupied Yaowangping and continued to invade west. After our reinforcements bravely counterattacked, the × retreated to Yaowangping and Yangjialing, and remained in a stalemate with us. There was no change as of noon on the 27th. More than 100 × in Shenchi moved towards Wuzhai in two routes on the 26th, and the × in Jingle also invaded west in separate groups, with the appearance of attacking Lan County. We are dividing our forces to meet them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] In the Yanbei area, our guerrillas have repeatedly achieved great feats. Due to traffic obstruction, news is delayed. According to reports from the front, a certain guerrilla unit of ours attacked Hunyuan on the evening of the 13th and entered the city at midnight. After three hours of hand-to-hand combat, more than 100 × were killed. The remnants were unable to support themselves and abandoned the city and fled. We obtained a lot of spoils of war. Hunyuan is the gateway to Datong. It is surrounded by ×. We did not consider it convenient to defend for a long time, so we burned down the × warehouse and withdrew at dawn.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] (1) The × in Xia County attacked Shicun and Duan Village east of Anyi on the afternoon of the 6th and were repelled by our army. Another unit attacked Wanggukou in the south and was counterattacked by a certain unit of ours, killing more than 100 ×. The remnants retreated to Xia County. (2) On the morning of the 27th, more than 3,000 × were added to Quwo from the north and bombarded our various positions in the southeast. They have been in contact with our guerrillas for several days, and the battle is fierce. (3) The × in the south gate of Taigu have been under siege by us since the 27th for two days, killing more than 300 ×. We took advantage of the victory to break through the ×'s barbed wire and occupied two blockhouses, capturing more than 100 × rifles and two light machine guns. The × could not support themselves and burned several houses in the town. We are still continuing the fierce attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dali, 30th] The × in Weiguo (north of Xia County), numbering seven or eight hundred, attacked Xiaowang Village and Guoniubao (southeast of Wenxi) from Dayang Village on the morning of the 28th and were repelled by our army. Our army immediately advanced towards Wenxi. On the morning of the 29th, it had passed the suburbs of the city and was engaged in a fierce battle with the ×.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] More than 1,000 × who invaded Gucheng Town in Wuxiang, southeastern Shanxi, and more than 2,000 × in Shipan Town and west of Yushe, all retreated to Nanguan Town and the vicinity of Beiguan (south of Taigu). Before leaving, they burned down all the houses in Shipan and Gucheng Towns. More than 400 × in Qingyuan were attacked by guerrillas in the Shecun area (north of Qingyuan) on the 26th and were surrounded by us. Dozens of people were annihilated. Then, under the cover of artillery fire, they invaded Shecun. Two platoons of our officers and soldiers bravely sacrificed themselves. Our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce flanking attack on the ×, which was then driven away. More than 100 × in Jiaocheng went to reinforce and were also repelled by us.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Hequ, 30th] The × who invaded Pian Guan have recently divided into three routes to attack west. They are currently fighting with a certain unit of ours near Yangweigou (80 li east of Hequ). Near Hualin Fort, the × and we also had contact. In the suburbs of Pian Guan, our army has surrounded the city. The defending × have all retreated and gathered in the east. The rear of the × attacking west has been cut off by our army.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 30th] On the morning of the 26th, a part of the × in Yanchi and Duan Village sneaked into Xuangukou (southeast of Anyi) and attacked a certain position of our army. After being severely attacked by us, they fled in embarrassment. Also, on the morning of the 25th, a part of the × in Jiexian attacked east and was ambushed by our army near Canfang Village, killing and wounding dozens of ×. The remnants fled west to Zhangdian. Houwang is still under our encirclement. The × near Yicheng and Fushan are in a state of confrontation with us.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 30th] On the evening of the 24th, 5-600 × jointly invaded Liujia Yuan, which belongs to the Zhao area of Zhaocheng and Wan'an. On the morning of the 25th, a part of the × cavalry, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked Leishang Village in Fenxi. A certain unit of ours is giving them a severe blow. Another unit of ours attacked the × in Liujia Yuan at noon on the 25th. The × fled in panic eastward through Huangcun and were ambushed by our troops in Caojiazhuang. The × were killed and wounded and fled in panic to Zhaocheng. We then successively recovered Liujia Yuan, Huangcun, Caojiazhuang and other villages. In this battle, eight or ninety × were killed or wounded. We captured a number of horses and a part of military supplies.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Shilou, Mid-day] A certain unit of ours attacking Wenxi advanced to the vicinity of Daxiang Village in Wenxian on the evening of the 22nd and severely damaged the highway from Dabai to Wenxi. Then, a part of the ambush was set up near Dongcun to wait for the ×. At about 7:00 AM on the 23rd, a part of the × in Wenxi sneaked out of Dongcun. Our ambush opened fire violently. The × retreated to Dongcun and resisted stubbornly. After a fierce battle for more than three hours, the × collapsed and retreated to Wenxi, killing more than 40 ×. At this moment, our army is pressing towards Wenxi City.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Medicine "Insurance Pills" Can Replace Imported Anesthetics; Drug Research Institute Reports Chemical Verification Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 29th] Since the Central Drug Research Institute moved to Chongqing last year, it has been aware that China's wound medicine has mostly relied on foreign countries, which is very uneconomical during the War of Resistance. Yunnan medicinal materials such as "Insurance Pills" and "Jingang Powder" are well-known, so they have been thoroughly studied. The results have now been obtained, and their efficacy is considered to be very good. Liu Shaoguang, director of the institute, specially invited people from all walks of life today to make a public report on the research results, believing that "Insurance Pills" are an important medicine for paralyzing parasympathetic nerves, and their value is above that of Caisobel and Fritillaria. They are of great help for wound relief, alcohol prohibition, and smoking cessation, and can replace the use of imported atropine and scopolamine.</p>

<h3>×'s Foreign Exchange Control in North China Has Almost Completely Failed; British Newspaper's Lengthy Commentary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, Day] The Financial News published a commentary yesterday, the full text of which is very long, saying that Japan's foreign exchange control and import control in North China have almost completely failed. The reason why trade in North China has not completely stopped today is that the Japanese side understands where the core of the problem lies and does not want to insist on the full implementation of its control regulations. However, it is impossible to determine when the Japanese side will announce the actual implementation. Therefore, all trade contracts, both long-term and short-term, cannot be concluded. At the moment, all sectors in Britain are paying close attention to the progress of the Chinese military. According to news from China, China has already achieved some important achievements.</p>

<h3>Japan's Invasion of China Encounters Unprecedented Difficulties; The Conspiracy of a Quick Victory and a Quick End Has Fundamentally Failed; The Japanese Army Is Stuck in the Mud and Is Besieged by Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Editorial</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Moscow, 30th Tass telegram: Soviet Commentary, saying that the Japanese warlords' plan to occupy and subdue China in the shortest possible time has fundamentally failed. After the Japanese army seized Hankou and Guangzhou, they invaded central China. However, the further aggressive actions of the Japanese army have encountered special difficulties. The Japanese army units are far away from their main base. Their transportation has been constantly threatened by the increasingly developed guerrilla activities in their rear. Powerful and effective guerrilla activities have already occurred in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and they are rising daily. The heroism of the Chinese guerrillas has written a most praiseworthy chapter in the history of the Chinese people's struggle. The guerrillas and regular army in the Chinese army have transformed the rear of the Japanese army into a real front. The Japanese army is forced to transfer a strong force to deal with the guerrillas, so all kinds of difficulties have occurred on the Japanese warlords' side. The economic situation in the rear and at home of the Japanese army is also chaotic, the reserves have been exhausted, and there is an extreme lack of raw materials. The public's dissatisfaction with the war and the pain of imperialism are constantly developing in the rear of Japan, while China's strength is growing stronger and stronger in the process of the national liberation war. The sympathy and assistance of all progressive people throughout the civilized world naturally supports China.</p>
<h3>National Foreign Trade Statistics for March</h3>

<h3>Comforting the Inspection Group on the Northwestern Shanxi Battlefield (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Chang</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the joint gathering of the entire regiment of Commander Dong's army, they nurtured the thought that domestic war might reignite after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. After a heated discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that there would be no more division within the country. Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was long-term, not only for jointly resisting Japan but also for jointly building the nation. Other units also put forward many opinions, such as the importance of work related to puppet troops and the urgency of organizing the masses and training the entire countryside. Some units acknowledged their lack of progress and hoped to receive assistance from all parties. Some units admitted that their cooperation with friendly forces was insufficient, and even frictions occurred. In addition to feeling ashamed, they expressed their willingness to do their best to correct themselves. Joint gatherings often extended to four or five hours. Through self-introductions, the guests and hosts, superiors and subordinates, felt no restraint whatsoever. Due to the difficulties of the environment, the consolation gifts from the consolation group could not be abundant. Therefore, the significance of the consolation was that the spirit exceeded the material. Speaking of this, the presentation of the national flag best represented the meaning of spiritual comfort. Detachment Leader Mao said, "This is the first time we have received consolation." Other units also regarded the presentation of the flag as an extremely solemn event. Indeed, on the guerrilla battlefield, seeing the national flag of the motherland brought unexpected joy.</p>
<p>The two greatest gains of this consolation tour were: first, the communication with the rear areas, and second, the improvement of the relationship between the garrison troops and local organizations and the people.</p>
<p>The Northwest is the front line of national defense. Even on this fiery front line, that is, even within the guerrilla base areas, there is a distinction between the rear areas. Under emergency circumstances, the consolation tour group departed for the front. Seeing that the general public was still carrying out their activities as usual, and the front-line troops were even more calm and composed in their guerrilla warfare life, this point is worthy of the people in the rear areas to emulate. For example, the Guannan Guerrilla Army in XX had been criticized for their poor military discipline. After a detailed investigation by the consolation group, it was learned that the root cause of this matter was the need for grain in the local area and the violation of military discipline by some bad elements. This discovery can enhance mutual understanding between the army and the people, and can also remind the authorities to pay attention and provide lessons for friendly forces. For example, the loss of Shenchi was objectively due to the poor terrain of Shenchi, making it difficult to defend the city. However, people in the rear areas did not understand the reason and harbored distrust towards some troops of the 25th Army. After the consolation efforts of the consolation group, they understood the actual situation. In Shuoxian and Shenchi, they had personally seen that this unit had recently won many trophies, such as electrical wires and railway tracks. This not only enabled the general public to understand the truth and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, but also made the people in the rear areas feel infinitely inspired. In addition, the things that the front line lacked were often unknown to the rear areas. Through their consolation, the compatriots in the rear areas knew how to help the front-line troops. This large-scale consolation in northwestern Shanxi was the first time. After this consolation, not only did the working comrades in the rear areas gain a lot of knowledge and insights from the returned reports, but the front-line troops also began to feel that their past cultural and entertainment work was insufficient and hoped that such a consolation group could frequently go to the front.</p>
<p>An important gain of the consolation tour group was the improvement of the relationship between the troops in the area and local organizations and the masses. Because the consolation tour group was jointly formed by representatives from various leading organizations in the second district of Shanxi, they could not only inspect local organizations but also further provide local organizations with suggestions, assistance, and guidance for the cooperation and coordination between the garrison troops and the people. According to the consolation group's report, in addition to the well-established Eighth Route Army Mao Detachment, the Death Squad and Guerrilla Regiment were also able to establish close ties with local organizations. Civil affairs work was good, and the places where they were stationed had masses acting as sentries. In addition, local working comrades were also able to cooperate with the garrison troops to carry out work related to puppet troops. To the east of the Tie Road in the county, there were still working comrades working arduously in the district. However, some anti-Japanese troops did not perform sufficiently in this regard, resulting in a certain gap between the military and the people and between the military and the government. The consolation group was able to use persuasive and explanatory methods to improve and strengthen the relationship between the military and the government and between the military and the people. For example, after the loss of Ningwu, the general public did not understand the strategy and tactics and blamed the loss on the cavalry. The consolation group was able to help local work by explaining the incident to the masses. After the loss of Ningwu, the garrison troops retreated before notifying the local working comrades, who remained in the front lines because they did not know the news, resulting in minor losses. The consolation group tactfully made suggestions to the garrison troops, and the army deeply regretted their past mistakes and immediately ordered all subordinate units to earnestly protect the local working comrades. The local government of Shenchi was stationed in the Nanshan area, and the 35th Army was stationed in the Beishan area. The connection was very insufficient. When the enemy retreated from Shenchi, the government did not care, leaving an empty city, which became a place for traitors and gangsters to operate. What was regrettable was that the local government could not fully accept the suggestions, and as a result, various organizations could not be fully improved.</p>
<p>In addition to this, during its 50-day work, the consolation tour group discovered many noteworthy things. Now, it is presenting several particularly important ones for the reference of local authorities and people throughout the country.</p>
<p>First, there are many propaganda materials from enemy deception in the area, while our propaganda materials are relatively few. It is hoped that the rear areas can transport a large quantity and send printed propaganda materials to the front lines and the enemy areas.</p>
<p>Second, in the Shuoxian, Hecheng, and Ningwu areas, there are so-called "XX Squads" who often engage in banditry. In addition, some deserters from bad units have become bandits and harass the people. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to rectify this.</p>
<p>Third, Pingguan and Hecheng originally produce little grain, while there are many garrison troops. Shenchi and Shuoxian have more grain, but it is purchased by the enemy at high prices and imported into the enemy areas. It is hoped that the authorities will have a unified method.</p>
<p>Increased Import Surplus in Japan's Foreign Trade</p>
<p>The first quarter increased by 50 million compared to last year. Exports decreased by 13 million yen.</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] Mainland newspapers report that in the first quarter of this year, Japan's trade with countries other than the "Yen Bloc" had a large import surplus, with the surplus amounting to 199,737,000 yen. It is found that during this period, Japan imported goods from countries other than the "Yen Bloc," mostly raw materials for heavy industry, especially raw materials for the manufacture of munitions under the current emergency situation. The general public recognizes this point as important. Compared with the same period last year, exports decreased by 13,477,000 yen, while imports increased by 57,300,000 yen. This is particularly noteworthy because Japan's wartime situation makes it increasingly difficult to export products to foreign countries. Light industry and small industry have always been characteristic of Japan's manufacturing structure, and their exports account for a large part. Now, due to the emergency of the war against China and the constant need to prepare for any international contingencies, light industry and small industry seem to be rapidly giving way to heavy industry, especially the munitions industry. Japan tries to import goods into the Three Northeastern Provinces and North China, which are so-called "Yen Areas," and this is increasing. However, Japan's exports to the "Yen Bloc" do not directly result in the acquisition of currency. Japan has indeed obtained the raw material resources of the Three Northeastern Provinces and North China. According to the latest analysis, Japan obtains these raw materials, mostly by bartering with Japanese goods imported into the same region.</p>
<h3>Southeastern Shanxi in the Circle of Flames</h3>
<p>— Bei Liu, Special Airmail from Xi'an, April 23</p>
<p>1.  A Risky Encirclement</p>
<p>Recently, as the enemy intensified its "mopping-up" operations in North China and began its risky plan to attack the Northwest, the situation in southeastern Shanxi became tense again. Seventy or eighty traitors traveled from Anyang and Xingtai to southeastern Shanxi to carry out major activities. Enemy aircraft also constantly scouted and bombed various strongholds in southeastern Shanxi. All of this was the prelude to the enemy's attack on southeastern Shanxi. At the beginning of April, the enemy mobilized heavy troops from the Tongpu, Zhengtai, Pinghan, and Daqing railway lines, moving in several directions to launch an offensive against us. Enemy chieftain Sugiyama first went from Taiyuan to Jiexiu to plan a conspiracy. Regiment Commander Po Nan also went to Qixian to command. As a result, flames of war ignited everywhere in southeastern Shanxi.</p>
<p>The first to launch the offensive were the four or five thousand enemies in Pingyao and Jiexiu, taking a position of mutual support, dividing into two routes to invade southeastward. They were met with our firm resistance. The enemy even released a large amount of poisonous gas to continue the assault southeastward. The enemy in Hongdong, Fushan, and Anze were tasked with invading eastward on the southern route. The enemy in Qixian and Taigu were tasked with moving northward towards Zihongkou and Malingguan, plotting to attack Qin County and Qinyuan. In addition, the two or three thousand enemies in Pinging and Heshun, south of the Zhengtai Road, also began to move southward. The enemies in northern Henan, Wu'an, Shexian, Boai, and Qinyang also gradually advanced westward. The enemies planned to replay the failed battle of "the nine-pronged encirclement of southeastern Shanxi last spring."</p>
<p>Targeting the enemy's conspiracy, we launched a swift and overwhelming counter-offensive on all fronts. On April 6, the operation began. The western section of the Zhongtiao Mountains echoed with the signal cannons of victory. Our mighty Iron Eagles also flew to southern Shanxi, carrying out fierce bombing raids on the enemy. Brave soldiers of the army advanced into Xiaxian City and fought a fierce street battle with the enemy for two days. Most of the large and small strongholds in Anyi, Yuncheng, Xiaxian, and Wenxi were recaptured by our soldiers. At the same time, the enemies in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Hongdong suffered fatal blows from us. The enemies on other routes were also severely battered by us and could not advance further. The piece of meat that the enemies had coveted for a long time not only could not be eaten but also suffered a bloody nose and swollen face, with their teeth being knocked out.</p>
<p>2.  Crushing the Enemy's Conspiracy</p>
<p>The enemies who invaded Heshun and Liaoxian this time were mostly poorly clothed and in a state of disarray. This proves that the enemies have reached the end of their rope and also prevents the enemy from adopting the policy of "procuring on the spot."</p>
<p>"Procuring on the spot" is not only a concrete application of the enemy's vicious policy of "controlling China with Chinese," but also tells us that the enemy's propaganda of "no grain collection for three years" and "the imperial army does not harm the common people" is all enemy lies. We can see this from the recent looting and abuses by the enemy in southern Shanxi and the fact that the enemy in Fushan stole more than 200 carts and more than 80 cattle from the villagers in the course of the war. In addition, the conscription of young men in various places and the forced conscription of young men from each village into the city for training are even more hateful.</p>
<p>In order to promote the collapse of the enemy and break the enemy's conspiracy, the compatriots in southeastern Shanxi proposed the action and determination of clearing the fields and emptying the houses. The so-called "empty houses" means that when the enemy attacks, people and goods are moved to a safe place without hesitation and in a planned manner. "Clearing the fields" means thoroughly destroying roads, dismantling castles, and not leaving anything that can be used by the enemy. In the Jinjicha Border Region, as well as Heshun and Liaoxian, the work of "emptying the houses and clearing the fields" has been thoroughly implemented, so that when the enemy arrives, they cannot gain a foothold and receive the supreme effect of controlling the enemy's fate.</p>
<p>3.  Thorough Clearing of Houses and Fields</p>
<p>Under the tense situation in southeastern Shanxi, the counties and districts in southeastern Shanxi, in order to prepare for contingencies, raise war awareness, and intensify mobilization, are all carrying out the work of clearing the houses and fields in order to thoroughly crush the enemy's new offensive. In particular, all the residents' bulky items, such as chests, clothes, food, etc., are moved to the areas designated by the government. The steps of removal are women and food and livestock and the goods of shops in towns and villages and idle furniture. The self-defense teams and the strong laborers act first, and retreat together with various organizations. Food stalls are designated to remain temporarily to meet the needs of the national army. Lighter offenders are released on bail, and heavier offenders are guarded on the spot. The duration of the clearing of houses and fields is determined by the situation and environment. As for wells, mills, and stoves, they are left to be destroyed last.</p>
<p>In order to be serious and orderly, a inspection committee is specially organized, consisting of members from the county government, the Sacrifice League, the Death Squad, the Jinan Working Group, farmers, workers, merchants, youth, women's national salvation associations, and children's teams. They decided that neither government agencies, mass organizations, nor the general public should hesitate or perfunctorily deal with matters. If the covenant is violated, it will be punished. This is a sacred and inviolable covenant. Because of this, the work in each county and district has achieved the intended results. The compatriots in southeastern Shanxi are so determined to prepare to welcome the enemy.</p>
<p>Based on the experience and lessons of the past year, they decided that the work of clearing the houses and fields should be done so that our troops have food, fodder, and water to drink even one minute before the arrival of the enemy. One minute after the enemy arrives, they will not find anything. For these reasons, they organized a transport team to be responsible for the final evacuation of food and the evacuation of wounded soldiers; there is also a demolition team responsible for destroying roads and things that cannot be moved, because the enemy often uses many heavy things to fill them with sand and erect barbed wire to build defensive works.</p>
<p>4.  Setting Up a Net to Eliminate Traitors</p>
<p>In the enemy's new offensive, in addition to military action, it is also accompanied by political conspiracies. From the few traitors we have captured, we have learned a lot about such evil activities. Therefore, in southeastern Shanxi, a widespread campaign to eliminate traitors is now being launched. They organized traitor-elimination teams and set up traitor-elimination nets in preparation for clearing out traitors, because traitors are the vanguard of the enemy, the eyes and ears of the enemy's military offensive. If we want to defeat the enemy, we must first work hard to eliminate traitors.</p>
<p>Southeastern Shanxi is our anti-enemy base area. The results of the year-long activity of being traitors has promoted our achievement of actively eliminating traitors. All parties can understand each other and help each other, so that traitors have no gaps to enter and no time to leave. The people's skills and vigilance in eliminating traitors have become more and more improved. Children have also been organized to perform inspection and sentry duties at the intersections of each village and town, which has further strengthened the difficulty of traitors' activities.</p>
<p>In Gaoping, southeastern Shanxi, some farmers caught several enemy spies last month, and now there are incidents of children catching two armed traitors. The facts are as follows: on the 21st of this month, when the children of Shucun were performing their sentry duties, two men in military uniforms suddenly appeared, wanting to pass through this village and head north. One of the men had a "student" badge. The children saw that they were suspicious and grabbed them, pulling them to the village office for inspection. When the village chief and district chief interrogated them, the traitors even produced guns, almost causing an accident. As a result, a red handkerchief, a bottle of water, and a pistol were found on the body of the traitor from Jinan, and a badge of the puppet maintenance association of Xianshan County and a pass from the puppet maintenance association of Zhangde Prefecture were found on the body of the traitor from Hongdong. Such events are constantly being staged. The children of southeastern Shanxi are weaving the great task of defending southeastern Shanxi under the guidance of adults.</p>

This agreement is beneficial to the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The French side is currently paying close attention to the Polish issue and awaiting Germany's statement of attitude.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu hosted journalists from various countries this afternoon and gave a speech stating that Romania's current policy is extremely clear and independent. Our country loves peace and will certainly support all efforts to establish peace. I am gratified that all countries I have visited are able to understand our country's position in the international community. The results of this visit to France have been extremely satisfactory. In the evening at 8 o'clock, he and his wife left for Rome.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 29th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has departed from Paris to come here and will hold talks with Italian authorities. Fascist party members attach great importance to the outcome of the talks, hoping that Romania will join the German-Italian axis, so that its oil production can be controlled by Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 29th] Five more French warships arrived today, including the 22,000-ton battleship "Bretagne." Currently, the fleet concentrated in the port of Gibraltar includes three French battleships. At the same time, many British and French warships are also anchored in the vicinity of Gibraltar. The Franco-Spanish border was suddenly closed today for unknown reasons. A group of Spanish refugees was preparing to return to Spain from France, but was forced to turn back due to the border closure.</p>
<h3>Disagreements Among Germany, Italy, and Japan; Military Alliance Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Regarding the matter of Germany, Italy, and Japan changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, there are disagreements among the three countries. This news was prominently published by London newspapers yesterday. The general opinion is that although Germany is eager to conclude a military alliance, it has not yet succeeded. Hitler's speech the other day did not mention Japan, which is sufficient to prove this. Some newspapers believe that Japan will at most conclude an alliance with Germany to confront the Soviet Union. Well-informed Japanese sources here share the same opinion, stating that Japan can only participate in European wars if it is attacked by the Soviet Union. British officials also share the same opinion as everyone else, that is, there is currently no military alliance among Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<h3>Poland to Give Formal Response to Germany's Memorandum, While Taking Military Preparations to Defend Danzig and the Polish Corridor</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The Polish government has recently informed France that it is determined to resist any attempts to seize the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor by force. Hitler's cancellation of the German-Polish Treaty has no effect on Poland. Poland expresses great confidence in its own strength and the spiritual and material assistance of Britain and France.</p>
<p>[United Press, Warsaw, 30th] The Polish President, Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, senior army officers, and cabinet ministers held a meeting yesterday afternoon and decided that current military preparations cannot be relaxed, but they will still seek to maintain good relations with neighboring countries. This decision will be announced by Polish Foreign Minister Beck in the National Assembly next week. At the same time, Poland has resolutely rejected Germany's demands for the return of Danzig and the construction of a road across the border. Furthermore, Poland will reply to Hitler's declaration of the abolition of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact next week. At the same time, the Polish government is making every effort to take military preparations to prevent Hitler's occupation of Danzig. It is reported that the first step in resolving the Polish-German issue awaits the return of the German ambassador to Poland, who left Poland on the 6th of this month and returned to Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] The Polish Foreign Minister will reply to Hitler at the beginning of next week. Polish Foreign Minister Beck will deliver a speech on foreign affairs and formally present a response to Germany's memorandum in Berlin. Hitler's claim that he had proposed concluding a 25-year non-aggression pact and a joint guarantee of Slovakia by Germany, Poland, and is denied here, believing that the purpose of this claim is to sow discord between Britain and Poland. The official attitude towards the Danzig issue and the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor directly to the Free City of Danzig has not changed. If Hitler's intention was to test Poland's reaction, this move has clearly failed. The Warsaw Culture News states that the impact of Hitler's speech is the cancellation of the national defense bond. The Polish authorities have not yet taken any new national defense measures.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] A certain foreign news agency has rumored that Britain has sent a message to Poland, clarifying that the conclusion of the British-Polish agreement is not intended to encourage Poland to deal with any reasonable German proposals with an attitude that leaves no room for consultation. Polish officials denied this rumor today.</p>
<h3>German-Italian Military Talks; Joint Intimidation of Poland; German Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Rome</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 29th] General Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, accompanied by several generals from his staff, arrived in Rome tonight to prepare for staff talks with Italian military leaders. The Italian cabinet met today, with the Prime Minister reporting on the decision of the Chief of Staff and the Finance Minister on April 7th regarding the allocation of the 10 billion lire special national defense adjustment fund designated last December. According to unconfirmed reports, 5 billion lire of the new adjustment fund has been allocated to adjusting the army's expenses, to be completed within ten years. According to the official mouthpiece, "Gazzetta del Popolo," this massive expense represents another strong response from Italy to the democratic front's policy of encircling Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Less than 24 hours after Hitler's speech, Germany began a large-scale intimidation campaign against Poland. Nazi newspapers launched a scathing attack, sharply contrasting former Czechoslovak President Beneš with Polish Foreign Minister Beck, questioning whether Beck was willing to suffer the same fate as Beneš. In addition, there was a noteworthy piece of news originating from Berlin and reported by "Agenzia Stefani," stating that German Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch arrived in Rome today to hold staff meetings with Italian Lieutenant General Pariani. The dispatch contained a warning from Italy to Poland, urging it not to harm Italian-Polish relations and reminding it to pay attention to the fate of Czechoslovakia as "a cautionary tale for those who choose unwise methods to safeguard their untenable positions." The dispatch continued to emphasize the importance of these German-Italian military talks, stating that Brauchitsch's visit to Italy had been arranged long ago, but it would not be surprising if the talks now covered more important issues than originally anticipated, or if this opportunity was used to discuss pressing issues beyond the original agenda. The Warsaw correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" reported that the Axis countries' intimidation of Poland had only led Poland to call up more reserve personnel and to strengthen Polish-Soviet relations. The ideological discord between Poland and the Soviet Union had disappeared as a result of Hitler's attack, and Anglo-Soviet negotiations would proceed smoothly. Poland was not concerned about Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the non-aggression pact, as Hitler would have abandoned the treaty sooner or later if it were not useful to Germany. According to Italian official sources, Italy is currently stepping up the training of its air force, and all air force reserves and aviation personnel who have not received previous training are being called up for training starting June 1st for a period of two months. As for expanding substantive military mobilization, officials said that a decision had also been made.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] German newspapers today again heavily publicized that German residents within Poland were being attacked by Poles, indicating that relations between Germany and Poland are becoming increasingly tense. Yesterday, Hitler held talks with Ribbentrop and met with the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the evening. Officials said that "Roosevelt has been won over by Hitler."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] It is reported that Hitler will definitely not discuss diplomatic issues in his Labor Day speech. German newspapers tonight have taken a tougher stance on Poland and are also carefully studying foreign criticisms of Hitler's speech. The German side considers most criticisms to be unreasonable and stubborn.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 30th] Political circles here believe that the Italian government's decision to expand its military is a response to Chamberlain's announcement of the implementation of conscription. Political figures also pointed out that Mussolini met with the Army Chief of Staff and the Finance Minister on the 26th (the day after Chamberlain announced conscription).</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister; Discussion of Issues Related to the Two Countries</h3>

Before leaving, he told the press that President Roosevelt's telegram of the 15th was a courageous move. He believed that war was inevitable, and the key to whether the current problems could be resolved lies solely with Hitler in Germany. However, no one can predict what Hitler intends to do in the future.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Today's Topic</h3>
<p>What day is today? May 1st. The great International Labor Day. The labor world around the world is warmly celebrating today. The domestic labor world in China is also very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Only Japan is an exception. Since the "September 18th" Incident, while superficially upholding world peace, they have announced the abolition of Labor Day. We must overthrow Japanese imperialism. Speaking of Labor Day, some people seem to dislike it a bit, but the situation today is different. First, the Soviet Union, the protector of the labor world, has become a cornerstone in maintaining world peace; second, capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and the United States are negotiating to cooperate with the Soviet Union, a country of labor; third, the main task of workers around the world today is to fight against fascism and aggression.</p>
<p>Speaking of China, the only task of the labor world today is to support the war of resistance and national construction, and to oppose fascist aggression. Because only in this way can there be a real way out.</p>
<p>Domestically, the call to improve people's livelihoods is growing louder as the war of resistance progresses. We believe that action is better than empty words. What is action? First, workers must enthusiastically participate in production and strive to increase production; second, government and community leaders must encourage labor and unemployed workers to participate in production, or ensure that they can automatically and actively improve production efficiency!</p>
<p>However, an even more urgent prerequisite is to make workers literate, to educate workers, and to eliminate labor illiteracy. This is the fundamental way to avoid all unnecessary disputes.</p>
<p>The gunfire of Japanese aggressors has forced many factories in China to relocate to this port. We admire the spirit of hard struggle of these factory authorities. We want to cooperate sincerely with the spirit of shared hardship. At the same time, in order to avoid unnecessary waste, it is best to strive to promote labor education and current affairs speeches, so that we can understand the difficulties of the times. Only with cooperation can there be a way out.</p>
<p>Today's telegrams to the UK are free of charge. Thank you for this good example. Quickly send a telegram to congratulate Mr. Attlee, a member of the Labour Party in the British House of Commons! He recently called for "unity against fascism and aggression," which is very helpful to the world and to China!</p>
<h3>Britain Actively Prepares for War; Divides the Country into Seven Regions for Food Supply in Wartime; Large-Scale Conscription to be Discussed in the House of Commons; Anglo-German Relations Under Review</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 30th] The British government is currently carefully studying the parts of Hitler's speech that involve Britain in order to examine whether Anglo-German relations can be improved. It is reported that Britain may ask Hitler to explain his speech. Also, Britain's military expansion is underway, and the issue of large-scale conscription will be discussed in the House of Commons on Thursday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Following the government's decision to implement conscription, the Army High Command held a meeting at 11 a.m. this morning to discuss the implementation methods. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha presided over the meeting, which lasted until 6 p.m. Those present did not have lunch but ate sandwiches and drank beer at the meeting place. This shows the importance of what was discussed. [Reuters, London, 29th] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, although Britain is prepared to respond to Germany's note abrogating the Anglo-German naval agreement at an appropriate time, the British government's current attitude shows no intention of agreeing to the suggestion that the two countries should hold a conference to discuss naval issues.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] The British government recently announced the division of the entire country into seven regions, each with a committee for the management of livestock and grain. This move is a further measure to prepare for maintaining food supplies in wartime.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] In the first three weeks of April, 40,000 people signed up to join the Territorial Army. This number is higher than the entire year of 1936, which was considered a boom year for military recruitment at the time. Among those who signed up this year, there were even those over the age of twenty-one. According to the conscription law, these personnel are not among those to be drafted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Concerns about the implementation of conscription in Northern Ireland and the issue of the legal status of Irish people in Britain after the implementation of conscription are one of the main reasons for de Valera's sudden postponement of his trip to the United States. However, according to news agency reports, these concerns will soon be eliminated, as the British government is eager to avoid any actions that could harm Anglo-Irish relations. Therefore, the issue of extending conscription in Northern Ireland has been definitively postponed. At the same time, regarding the issue of Irish residents in Britain, the authorities have also stipulated that only those born and registered in Britain can participate in military service.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] The British standing army will supplement the Second Armored Division to enhance its strength. According to a morning report in the "News Chronicle," the supplemented new division will be an independent organization and will not be related to the recently announced conscription system. The report also recalled that Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha stated to the House of Commons in March when submitting the army budget that he intended to add a large number of heavy tanks to enhance the strength of the standing army.</p>

<h3>The Air Defense Bureau Will Intensify Air Defense Training in the Middle of This Month; Conduct Wartime Air Defense Exercises; Implement Emergency Lighting Controls at Any Time; Shelters Will Be Set Up in the City Center</h3>
<p>Air defense matters in Hong Kong are now reaching a fever pitch. All kinds of equipment are making great progress. Previous lighting control exercises were all ordinary practice and the results could not be considered good. According to reliable news obtained by the reporter from the air defense authorities, the Air Defense Committee has decided to hold a wartime air defense exercise sometime in May. This exercise has a dual meaning. On the one hand, it allows residents to familiarize themselves with the sound of the alarm; on the other hand, it tests the speed and efficiency of lighting control. The exercise will occur on a certain day in the middle of this month, but the exact date will not be announced to the public. At that time, residents will only be given a hint, so that the alarm is issued from the bottom of the people's hearts. The alarm will first sound the air raid alarm, and finally the all-clear. The air defense authorities have decided that in the event of an air raid, pedestrians in the city center who do not have time to go home or return to their offices can obtain full protection in the city center shelters. These public shelter locations in the city center have been designated by Air Defense Commissioner Spurr as several government buildings. In case of emergency, these buildings will be reinforced to increase their resistance and add sandbags. Some open spaces have also been designated by the air defense authorities for the construction of air raid shelters when necessary. As for the Kowloon mainland, buildings have also been designated for public shelters. Each well in the area has been designated to be used to put out fires if water pipes are destroyed and a fire occurs at the same time, but absolutely not to be used as drinking water for residents. Regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of drinking water in Hong Kong, the authorities have already made a decision, but this plan is completely unrelated to the selected wells. In addition, the Air Defense Committee recently sent letters to various businesses, requesting that they select one or two employees to participate in various air defense training lecture classes. More than 180 replies have been received. These training lecture classes will begin at 5:30 p.m. on May 12th and will be held every Tuesday and Friday at 5:30 p.m. until the twelve lessons are completed. The responsible instructors are Air Defense Commissioner Spurr, Dunley, Fubar, and Neilson. The purpose of the training is to enable employees of various businesses to have sufficient air defense knowledge to plan the air defense design of their own businesses, be responsible for training various air defense personnel, and serve as liaison officers on the Air Defense Committee.</p>
<h3>Youth Day Begins; Food-Saving and Thrift Campaign; Student Relief Association to Implement for Three Days Starting Today; Notices Issued to Schools Asking Students to Respond</h3>

During this period, all students are asked to save food and be thrifty, and to donate the savings to the association to provide relief to the suffering compatriots in the war zone who are hungry, cold, displaced, and to provide funding for the association's service team to serve in the war zone. The association will send out visiting teams to various schools every day during this period to collect these donations, hoping that all students will work hard to donate so that many small amounts will make a large one, and work together to move this cause forward.</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchants Raise 300,000 to Open a Match Factory; Factory Site at Ma Tau Kok; Construction Work During the Day</h3>
<p>Matches are consumed in large quantities every day. In the past, matches from Sweden and Japan were widely sold in the Hong Kong and mainland markets.

<h3>Fundraising for Domestic Cultural Undertakings; Famous Play "A Year" to be Jointly Performed; Hong Kong Theater People Held Their First Performance Committee Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Officially Perform in Late May</h3>

<h3>Siam Adds New Taxes Again; Local Cloth Sales to Siam Hit Hard; New Tax Rate Several Times Higher Than Before; Other Local Goods Also Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's weaving industry has developed extremely rapidly in recent years, with many factories standing tall and their products sold far and wide around the world. Among them, sales in Southeast Asia are the largest. Only after last autumn did they begin to shrink. Among the sales of Hong Kong local textiles in Southeast Asia, Siam accounts for a large number. In the past, several million yuan worth of various fabrics were shipped from Hong Kong to that country every year. Not only were they popular with the local Chinese, but also many Siamese purchased them. Therefore, the sales of Hong Kong local textiles in that area increased year by year. However, since the Lunar New Year this year, the Siamese government has implemented new regulations, uniformly increasing taxes on the import of Chinese goods, especially for fabrics. For example, those that were previously taxed at 5% are now taxed at around 20%, several times higher than before. Therefore, import and export firms have stopped shipping goods one after another, and many of those ordered before the Lunar New Year have also been cancelled. Under these circumstances, Hong Kong's local textile market in Siam has shrunk day by day, almost disappearing. Therefore, at present, the local textiles shipped from Hong Kong to Southeast Asia are only to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. It is reported that the sales of other local goods to Siam have also decreased due to the high tariff barriers.</p>
<h3>Free Telegrams Can be Sent Today; But Only for Social Telegrams</h3>

The newly revised social telegram fee of the company is four yuan for each telegram with twelve characters, and an additional 33 cents are charged for each additional character.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Hong Kong Population; Cholera Prevention Campaign Advanced; Free Vaccinations as Last Year; Inspection of Ships Arriving from Infected Ports</h3>
<p>Each summer, Hong Kong tends to experience cholera epidemics, with a significant number of residents dying from it each year. Aware of the substantial increase in Hong Kong's population density this year, and fearing that a cholera outbreak would lead to severe mortality and unimaginable consequences, health authorities have advanced the cholera prevention campaign. Yesterday, Director of Medical Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, shared his views with reporters, stating that the previous year's cholera prevention campaign was very successful, with 940,000 people receiving cholera vaccinations. Consequently, only 547 cases of the disease occurred last year, with only 349 deaths, a reduction of more than half compared to the 1,401 cases and 776 deaths in 1937. He hoped that Hong Kong residents would continue to cooperate as they did last year, so the disease would not be a major concern. This year's campaign has been brought forward and will commence in a day or two. All measures will follow last year's, with free vaccinations provided at public clinics and hospitals. Patients infected with the disease will be isolated in infectious disease hospitals to prevent its spread. Propaganda posters and leaflets will be posted on walls and lampposts along main roads to urge residents to pay attention and get vaccinated promptly. The sale of unsanitary food will also be prohibited. Ships arriving from ports declared as infected must undergo maritime inspection. Passengers without cholera vaccinations will not be allowed to disembark in Hong Kong. When a case of the disease occurs in a building, in addition to sending the patient to the hospital, the building must be disinfected. Regarding cholera vaccinations, the Director of Medical Services also hoped that residents would voluntarily seek vaccinations from private doctors at their own expense to avoid overcrowding at public hospitals.</p>

<h3>The Passion and Power of Laborers: Printing Workers Raise Funds for Children's Art Exhibition; Electrical Workers Hold National Covenant Oath Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Consider reporting on these two passionate and powerful events as a gift to commemorate the sacred Labor Day.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9 a.m., the Chinese Bookstore Choir of the Third Special Branch of the Hong Kong Printing Workers' Union held a grand art exhibition at the Dongle Theatre to raise funds for the Children's Welfare Association.</p>
<p>Nearly a thousand people upstairs and downstairs filled the venue with noise.</p>
<p>The faces of the workers, etched with the marks of wind, frost, and toil, looked as innocent and lovely as the young because they were wearing glorious and vibrant work clothes. Glorious work clothes are gradually becoming a uniform loved by more people.</p>
<p>After the chairman announced the reasons for the meeting, Mr. Wang Xiaoying spoke sincerely on behalf of the Children's Welfare Association: "...Most of what I'm hearing today is Shanghainese, which fills me with emotion. Shanghai, my second hometown where I lived for ten years, I hope everyone will work together to fight back!"</p>
<p>—Who would forget their hometown? The atmosphere in the venue turned solemn.</p>
<p>"The three Hong Kong Children's Welfare Homes have taken in a total of 400 refugee children, most of whom come from Wuhan, except for a few who have stayed in [ ]. Although the Welfare Homes have sent letters to their families, a staggering 70-80% have been returned. One can only imagine the fate of their parents and families under [ ] [ ]. These orphans and refugee children [ ], we are very grateful for your enthusiastic fundraising and generous assistance. Refugee children who are hungry and wandering on the front lines are still waiting for us to rescue them! Let us cherish our next generation."</p>
<p>A burst of warm applause sent the compassionate Ms. Wang off the stage, followed by another round of enthusiastic applause as the prelude to the art performance.</p>
<p>After the singing and harmonica ensemble, the one-act national defense play "Defection" opened.</p>
<p>Northeast puppet troops awakened in a life of slavery. The passion of the vast number of brothers finally transformed the officers who "obeyed [ ] orders" into [ ] pioneers who "obeyed the motherland" and "obeyed the truth." "Roar!" The tide of "defection" finally drove the [ ] people out of the territory, and they all returned to their old homes in the Northeast. The living reality in the Northeast and North China was fully presented on stage.</p>
<p>The following national defense Peking opera "The Great Battle of Donglin Temple" suited the tastes of many outsiders. The sound of gongs and drums, the stylized movements of Peking opera, and the majestic voices allowed people to relive old dreams and feel a deeper affection for their beloved motherland. The play included [ ] hanging at the graves of soldiers who died in the war of resistance, and the壮烈of our army's defeat of [ ] [ ], truly a successful example of "new wine in old bottles." The enthusiastic atmosphere in the audience inspired us that in addition to promoting spoken drama, we must also supplement it with improved traditional opera to achieve greater results.</p>
<p>The association's charity performance raised approximately HK$600, all of which will be used to support the Children's Welfare Home. The expenses for this conference were covered by 59 enthusiastic members of the association, who contributed five, three, and one dollar each. Contributing both effort and money, they are truly generous and straightforward typical workers.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the reporter rushed to the Confucius Hall to participate in the National Covenant Oath Ceremony of the Chinese Workers' Recreation Club of the Hong Kong Electric Company. A large group are "manufacturers" of "spiritual food," and a large group are "controllers" of "light"; both types of laborers are equally sacred! Who says that society is not created by laborers?</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Electric Company has more than 600 Chinese workers, and the association has been established for nine years. In order not to forget the motherland and not to forget the responsibility on their shoulders, they held the National Covenant Oath Ceremony.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m., the solemn ceremony began. When observing a moment of silence for the soldiers who died on the front lines and the compatriots who lost their lives, Ms. Chen Zhijian sang a mournful requiem, and the entire audience was silent. Even the most insensitive person could not help but be moved.</p>
<p>The chairman was Mr. Li Fenghang, the chairman of the association. When announcing the reasons for the meeting, he was calm, sincere, and revealed the original demeanor of a labor leader. After reading the National Covenant publicly, Mr. Li Jianfeng, the editor-in-chief of the Industrial and Commercial Daily, presided over the oath and gave a speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Shu, the head of the First Regiment of the Guangxi Student Army, and Mr. Lu Fu, a member of the Standing Committee of the All-Circles Relief Association, also arrived. The chairman was very happy to invite them to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu first explained that workers are the main force in the national revolutionary struggle and the class that has contributed the most to the war of resistance. He then reiterated that today's oath must be aligned with the objective environment of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>First, we must strive for international sympathy through self-reliance; second, we must mobilize the vast power of overseas Chinese to support [ ] and assist in national reconstruction. Following that, Lin Shengxian cited the Shanghai carter A Mao in the January 28th Incident and an old boatman in Wuhan who deliberately drowned the [ ] people and military supplies he was carrying to achieve a great price at the expense of his own life, proving the greatness of the workers' power. No matter where or what kind of person, everyone has the opportunity to participate in [ ] [ ] [ ] and be loyal to the country. Deeply moving to the workers.</p>
<p>The Changhong Choir sang 11 songs of national salvation in succession, and the male and female duets deeply touched people's hearts.</p>
<p>The Youth Association Comics Society performed the drama "After the Fall," which was very successful. Liu Yiming, the director of the drama, and the actors Lin Ciming, Luo Liang, Li Yanfang, Chen Gui, Zheng Bingji, Lu Shan, Ma Yifei, and Liu Yao were all enthusiastic workers who loved drama. The Hong Kong Electric Company's after-work drama troupe performed the drama "Withdrawal," and the atmosphere at the venue remained tense.</p>
<p>After that, the association's national arts class held its opening ceremony, with national arts performances and lion dances, which lasted until 5 p.m. The sale of flowers at the venue raised HK$21.95, which was donated to the Children's Welfare Home and accepted and thanked by the representatives of the home.</p>
<p>Our workers have passion and power. They are a group of hardworking people.</p>
<p>They are the supporters of today's society and the creators of tomorrow's society. We mental laborers respectfully extend our most sincere salute for national liberation to the vast number of workers!</p>

<h3>Sketch of a Dartboard: Special Report</h3>
<p>In a narrow shop in the front half of a building, a white cloth with the words "Dartboard Grand Prizes" is hung at the entrance. "Dartboard" is a term often seen in old-fashioned martial arts novels, but now it has become a public gambling tool. The structure of this gambling device is very simple: a round piece of wood as big as a finger and about three inches long, with three or so hollow [ ] feathers or duck feathers attached to the tail, and a thick [ ] tube about one inch long inserted into the head. That's the dart. The method of throwing the dart is also easy. On the wall about five or six feet away, a wooden board is inlaid. The board is painted with small squares of five colors: red, yellow, blue, white, and black. If you are a gambler, if you choose a certain color, you throw the dart at the square of that color. If you are lucky and your technique is skillful, and you hit the target with one throw, you bet two copper coins, and you get a "Red Golden Dragon" cigarette worth one dime, including the principal and interest. If you don't want the cigarette, they can give you nine copper coins, which is a 10% discount on the price of a "Red Golden Dragon."</p>
<p>It is said that this kind of gambling is very fair. Anyone can pick up a "dart" and throw it (of course, you must have at least two copper coins to bet), so there is absolutely no cheating. However, if you repeatedly fail to hit the target, you should blame your fate and lament your bad luck. If you try to stand in front of the prize distribution point, you will hear someone talking loudly about someone who won fifty or sixty dollars here yesterday, and someone else who quickly hit the target several times an hour ago and won more than a hundred dollars. On the other side, you will hear someone saying, "'Young man,' you lost again, don't buy red, buy white." And to a maid servant, he said, "If you bet a few more times, you can easily win back. You only lost a dozen dollars, why would you give up so easily? Take a puff of cigarette, take a breath, and then go back." With such words, the front of the booth is crowded, and the business seems to be not bad. However, the world is the world of people. If your business is really good, someone will come to ask you to share the profits. So, there are people who take advantage of others' influence to settle accounts with you. A man dressed in short clothes squeezed up to see the scene and said intentionally or unintentionally, "Business is very good, you are really making a lot of money." But they shook their heads and said, "In the past, 'giving money' was only twenty dollars a day, but now it costs forty or fifty dollars more, plus rent and the wages of partners and other things. We have to earn eighty or ninety dollars a day to avoid losing money, but how can we earn eighty or ninety dollars every day? Not collecting protection money is already lucky, you still say we are making a lot of money." The man in short clothes did not say a word, took the five-dollar bill they gave him and picked up a pack of free Red Golden Dragon, took out a cigarette and burned it, and strode out.</p>
<p>Even though it is said that not collecting protection money is already lucky, there are still many people continuing to open businesses. Not counting those facing the sea, there are already seventy or eighty "Dartboard Grand Prize" locations in Central, Sheung Wan, Eastern District, and Western District. I heard that the people who collect "money distribution" are now thinking of adding one-third to the amount. This is of course taking wool from the sheep. Regarding this point, it has not been told to the readers that the dartboard is a profitable business, but if you are not afraid of taking turns paying, then this place is a safe place for gamblers. Because there is a grand prize as a amulet for non-illegal gambling, and there is also protection money for "distributing money," there is absolutely no risk of failure.</p>

<h3>X Troops Stirring in Sanshui; Our Guerrillas in Nansan Counties Rise Up; We Are on High Alert and Disrupting the X Troops' Rear; Our Detachment in the Lower West River Attacked Guanshan at Night</h3>
<p>[West River Express] Recently, there has been an increase in X troops in the Sanshui area of the West River. We are on high alert and have ordered the guerrillas in Nanhai and Sanshui counties to launch a full-scale operation with a keen attitude in order to disrupt the rear of the X troops and contain the X troops on the front lines. After the guerrillas in the two counties carried out their operations, they have repeatedly struck the X troops and assisted the regular army in their combat power. On the 27th and 28th, the guerrillas of Sanshui and Nanhai joined forces to annihilate the X troops. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>X Troops Stirring in Sanshui</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the front, the X troops entrenched in Sanshui have recently continued to increase. On the 24th, 25th and 26th, the X troops' vehicles traveled frequently along the Guangsan Railway. In addition to a part reinforcing the Jiujiang Heqing Erlong area of the Jiangfo Line, another part was heading to the Sanshui front line. In recent days, a large number of X military weapons and ammunition have arrived at the front line and stored in Sanshui city and the X camp in Hekou Southwest Ganggen. Recently, 60 or 70 X speedboats and electric boats have also sailed to the river surface near Jiaokou Sixianjiao. On the 25th and 26th, the X speedboats carried a small number of X soldiers and patrolled and peered, looking at the old Sanshui Qingqi coast with binoculars, with a very active appearance. Upon receiving the report, Deng Longguang, the former commander of the West Line Front X, ordered the front-line guards to be on high alert and monitor, and to seize the opportunity to attack. In addition, a certain elite artillery unit was dispatched to reinforce the strongholds of Ma Fang Hantang Qingqi Jinli on the front line and set up strong artillery positions to prevent X from forcibly crossing the West River and invading.</p>
<p>Guerrillas Destroy Guangsan Road</p>
<p>The Chen detachment of the guerrillas lurking in the eastern district of Sanshui recently received orders from the Western Military Authority to actively operate. It was learned a few days ago that the Guangsan Railway was busy with X transportation, day and night. On the 26th, they sneaked to the vicinity of Shangjiao and joined the Wu Qin detachment of the Nanhai County guerrillas. On the night of the 27th, they secretly went to the Xiaotang Station of the Guangsan Railway, [ ] the tracks there, destroyed more than ten feet of roadbed, and secretly laid landmines. On the dawn of the 28th, an X military vehicle opened from Foshan to Sanshui. When it arrived near Luocun, it was learned by a traitor that there was a change in the future and reported to the X military. The car stopped moving and dispatched a team of engineers to repair it. Unexpectedly, just starting work, they mistakenly triggered a landmine pre-laid by the guerrillas, and with a loud bang, it exploded on the spot. The X soldiers were caught off guard and were killed or injured in the process, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. Later, another team of X and X soldiers was dispatched from Foshan to continue the repair, and the traffic was restored in the afternoon. As for our guerrillas, they will continue their efforts to inflict the greatest damage on the road.</p>
<p>Gan Sanqiu Detachment Attacks Guanshan at Night</p>
<p>The Gan Sanzhu detachment of the guerrillas operating between Xiqiao in the lower reaches of the West River has repeatedly annihilated the X army. According to recent reports, more than 100 X soldiers arrived and stationed in Guanshan. On the 8th, a team was sent to Minle City. On the evening of that day, they met with local people and disguised themselves to sneak into Guanshan Market. Another team was at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain. At about 10 p.m., the team members hiding in the market set off a fire as a signal and rushed to the X camp entrenched in the silkworm experiment area in separate ways. They first threw hand grenades at the camp, and the X army was trapped on all sides and could not break through. They tightly clenched the door and fired machine guns outwards indiscriminately to prevent our guerrillas from rushing in. After about twenty minutes of contention, the X who were stationed on the sea surface rushed to rescue. Our guerrillas began to retreat to a certain place. In this night attack, more than 20 X soldiers were annihilated by us.</p>
<h3>X Army Repelled from Longyan Green Gorge; No Trace of X in Hecheng; Sanbu Relieved and Ferry Service Resumes</h3>
<p>[West River Express] The Hecheng battle: since our reinforcements arrived on the 28th and launched a fierce counterattack, after our army's courageous and bloody battle, the X army was finally repelled on the morning of the 9th and 700 to 800 people were annihilated. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>No Trace of X in Heshan County</p>
<p>In the Heshan battle, our army abandoned the Gulao and Gubao positions on the 27th and lured X to go deeper. X took advantage of the situation to increase the number of soldiers, and a total of more than 3,000 infantry and artillery soldiers under the protection of highly mechanized [ ] launched a fierce attack on Heshan County. Dozens of X aircraft were dispatched to run around, frantically bombing the Xinhu and Heshan border areas. On the 28th, the X were forced into the Huikeng Longmian community and other areas. The two sides fought for the heights and strongholds on the outskirts of the city, melee combat, and launched assaults dozens of times. X was still unable to advance an inch. At 2 p.m., 300 to 400 people were reinforced from Heqing and crossed the river to plot to attack our left wing of Heshan. Fortunately, at this time, our reinforcements also rushed from Gaoming Sanzhou. [ ] then defeated X in one fell swoop. Another unit copied Kunlun Mountain and joined our army moving to the west of the city, and counterattacked X at night. By the morning of the 29th, the X army attacking the city was finally repelled. There is now no trace of X in Heshan County. In this bloody battle that lasted day and night, a total of 500 to 600 X troops were annihilated.</p>
<p>X Defeated at Green Gorge</p>
<p>The X attacking Zhu Green Gorge on the north side of Hecheng was greeted by the 64th Army, which guarded the north side of the city, and the Heshan team to launch a head-on attack. The first to rush in was the cavalry. Our military team, regardless of everything, fought from the 27th to 2 p.m. on the 8th. X cavalry repeatedly advanced and failed. After many interceptions by our team, the X cavalry was annihilated. More than 300 people were destroyed, and more than 30 war horses were captured. X corpses were everywhere, but after the disastrous defeat, they fled to Gulao. It was also found that the X in Jianghui attacked Daze on the 27th. On the 28th, they attacked Du Ruan Jinggen and Pingdiling in separate ways along the Xinkai Jiangfo roads. However, in these two areas, our guards adopted a steady strategy and tried their best to hold on to the positions, so the X army's several advances were repelled. Because of this, the X and our armies are still in a stalemate in Du Ruan Pingdi. At 2 p.m. on the 28th, more than 10 X aircraft flew to Siqian Daze and dropped 60 to 70 bombs fiercely. The Daze and Xiaoze markets were almost bombed into scorched earth, and the losses were heavy. Fortunately, most of the people [ ] had already evacuated early, and the casualties were relatively small. In addition, after the X attacking Danshuikou and Gongyi were defeated by our reinforcements, as of the 28th, except for two X motorboats still patrolling the Yinhu Sanjiang sea, there was no trace of X in Danshuikou and Gongyi. Sanbu, Changsha, Xinchang, and Dihai have become more relaxed. It was found that the Deji and Hengji ferries, which traveled between Siyi Sanbu and Macau, have resumed direct access from Aoqianshan to Xinchang Sanbu since the 28th. The Fu'an ferry, which originally traveled to Rongqi Macau, has also been changed to Macau Sanbu and directly to Xinchang since yesterday. Sanbu traffic was then restored.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Merchant Ship Detained; Shantou Merchants Suffer Huge Losses; All Hope Norway Argues on Just Grounds</h3>
<p>[Shantou Express] The Norwegian merchant ship Gong Sheng, which was en route from Shanghai to Shantou via Fujian, was unreasonably detained by X warships near the Fujian Sea. It has been many days since then and has not been released. It was found that the ship carried many goods purchased by Shantou merchants. According to the Chamber of Commerce, the goods occupied by Shantou merchants on this trip to Shantou included more than 60,000 catties of soybean cake, more than 10,000 bags of wheat flour, and about 100 pieces of cotton yarn. In addition, there were medicinal materials and groceries. The total value of all goods was about 400,000 yuan. Shantou merchants first remit money to foreign ports and then deliver the goods, so the loss of Shantou merchants is very huge this time. I hope the Norwegian authorities will argue on just grounds and not allow the X army to use this robbery method.</p>
<h3>Officials in Huiyang Tour Together</h3>
<p>[Huiyang Express] Since the recovery of Huiyang, Liu Binggang, the magistrate of Huiyang County, He Zehong, the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, and Yang Xingmin, the deputy commander of the National Self-Defense Corps, have been planning all aspects of party, government, and military work in the county. Now, in order to understand the recent working conditions of the party, government, and military in the county and improve the wartime working efficiency, they have jointly toured all the districts under their jurisdiction for inspection. On the 26th, they patrolled and arrived at Danshui Market in the Second District. On the 27th, they transferred from Danshui to Pingshan Renshan and other districts.</p>
<h3>Shantou Continues to Intensify Evacuation of Population and Materials; Authorities Implement Mandatory Removal of Children; Otherwise, They Will Be Sent to Children's Welfare Homes for Accommodation</h3>
<p>[Shantou Express] The situation in Chaoshan has become increasingly tense recently. Although the deadline for evacuating the population and relocating materials has expired, there are still many who have not been able to relocate, so it is still being intensified. The evacuation of children is the most urgent task at present. In order to avoid children staying in dangerous areas, the authorities have decided to strictly enforce it. Yesterday, they specifically ordered the police stations in each district to be responsible for investigating the number of children who have not been evacuated in their jurisdiction in order to force them to leave the country separately. If their parents and relatives will not leave the country due to other relationships, they must also send their minor children to the Children's Welfare Association for accommodation to ensure safety. As for those who have not relocated materials and factories within the time limit, they are also ordered to report to the branch for investigation and verification, and the government will dismantle and manage them by itself. Since the X aircraft invaded Shantou three times on the 27th, most of the elderly, weak, women, and children have left Shantou. The Chaoshan electric boat capacity is extremely crowded. When the military and political authorities in Chaoshan discussed the methods of evacuating "people" and "things," they had a proposal to urge the people to organize wartime public refugee cooperation groups. Later, methods for organizing cooperative groups were drafted and announced. However, when the city evacuated the population this time, the general public was not very clear about this type of organization method, and there was no such organization. Zhang Jiabin, the director of the city's police station, specially ordered the staff of the bureau to organize a family group to drink to set an example for the citizens, and organized the evacuated group in accordance with the methods of the cooperative group. There are sound methods for the supply of medicines and the management of group living. The group has been evacuated to a safe area in the interior a few days ago. A total of more than 50 families participated and lived in one place, and the management was excellent.</p>
<h3>Party Members in the War Zone Losing Documents - Special Remedial Measures - Three Measures Specifically Established</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express] The Provincial Party is handling the general registration of party members and probationary party members from various counties. Various counties have complied with orders and completed their reports to the headquarters. It is now reported that party members from various counties in the war zone have lost their party membership documents due to the incidents, making it impossible to register in accordance with regulations. Three remedial measures have been specially formulated and distributed to the party headquarters in various counties in the war zone to be handled in a timely manner. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) If a party member loses their document, they may request a certificate from the district work committee or the county party headquarters (the party certificate or registration number issued by the Central Executive Committee or the Southwest Executive Department must be cancelled); (2) Those holding membership certificates of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, Kuomintang membership certificates (Kuomintang before the third year of the Republic), or those who obtained party membership qualifications after the thirteenth year and before the seventeenth year of the Republic, and have party membership certificates or other supporting evidence sufficient to prove it, are eligible for the special endorsement registration regulations. Those who obtained party membership qualifications after the seventeenth year of the Republic and hold party membership certificates or registration certificates, etc., should be handled in accordance with the general registration method; (3) Party dues owed by party members before registration will be waived. However, after registration, they must be collected in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Li Wuzi Wanted - Soldiers Who Retreat in the Face of Battle</h3>
<p>During the recent invasion of Xinhui by the × people, we mounted a strong resistance and fought fiercely for six days and nights, inflicting heavy casualties and significantly depleting the × people's strength. Subsequently, after obtaining considerable compensation, our side safely withdrew from the outskirts of Huicheng and firmly defended Fen Shui, Jiang Du Ruan, and other places. We have continued to resist and counterattack in recent days. It has been found that during this fierce battle, the soldiers fought valiantly and heroically. However, a small number of them deserted temporarily. They have now been dismissed, wanted, and investigated by Commander Li Wuzi of the Fifth Guerrilla Column. It has been found that there are seven officers among those wanted.</p>
<h3>Quiet on the Northern Guangdong Battlefield - Our × Forces Are Busy Deploying - Small Skirmishes on the Front Lines in Recent Days - The × Dare Not Disturb the Shengang Area</h3>
<p>[Northern Guangdong Express] The war in northern Guangdong has been relatively quiet recently because our × forces are busy with offensive and defensive deployments. The × fear being surrounded and annihilated by us, so they are actively reinforcing and on guard. However, due to continuous surprise attacks by our troops, they have suffered heavy losses, and their morale is low. They have been lying dormant in one corner in recent days, daring not to move. Therefore, there have only been small skirmishes on the front lines. The military situation is as follows:</p>
<p>West of Shengang - No Trace of the ×</p>
<p>Since our army captured Zhenhua, it has been attacking Shengang step by step. On the evening of the 24th, Liang's division attacked Shengang at night, annihilating dozens of ×. The × were quite panicked. Furthermore, due to the continuous heavy blows by our army in recent months, they have suffered more than half of their casualties, and their strength is extremely weak. Therefore, they have shortened the offensive lines around them and fortified their camps. It has been found that in the past, × infantry and cavalry often infiltrated and harassed the areas of Mumian Cliff, Jiu Lian Tomb, Maya Village, etc., west of Shengang, looting food. Recently, our army has deployed strong defensive lines in the area of Aotou Shiziqian, strictly controlling the ×. Therefore, they dare not send teams to disturb them. The above-mentioned areas are as peaceful as usual. Furthermore, on the 6th, some of the ×'s grain, supplies, and military goods in Shengang retreated towards Taipingchang. The intention is unclear.</p>
<p>Attack on Pingshan - Remnants of the × Annihilated</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wang's regiment of a certain division of our army in Huaxian has been pressing south along the Guanghua Line towards Xilong Pingshan in recent days. The × troops guarding this area are the remnants of the "Fujii" and "Watanabe" units. Fearing our attack, they come and go不定. On the 24th and 25th, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry, accompanied by a artillery platoon, infiltrated Pingshan. Our assault team then launched a surprise attack on the × late at night on the 26th, encircling and annihilating the × in several routes. The × troops resisted stubbornly, relying on the dangerous terrain, but their strength gradually waned. Subsequently, the × troops from Longkou Village heard the news and rushed to reinforce them in armored vehicles. A certain battalion of our fresh troops also joined the battle at this time. The battle was fierce. Our army bravely charged and stepped into the × formation. The × troops were defeated in a panic and retreated into the market town, where they were trapped. More than 20 were killed, and more than ten long and short guns and several war horses were captured. Our army did not withdraw to its original position until dawn.</p>
<p>Advance on Tanbu - The × Army Collapses in Defeat</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been found that along the Chantan Line on the left wing of the northern route, our army has also made progress in recent weeks. Li's division of the Twelfth Army Group pressed towards Tanbu from the direction of Chibaini. Only about a hundred × troops were stationed in this area. On the morning of the 27th, our artillery first launched an attack on the × troops, firing continuously fifty or sixty shells. Many of the shells hit their target, destroying the × fortifications. A certain battalion of our army took the opportunity to charge at the ×. The ×'s strength was weak, and they collapsed in one battle, retreating towards Fengyong. Our army launched an ambush, inflicting heavy casualties. By noon, the × in the vicinity of Tanbu were fleeing south. Our army is pursuing the victory.</p>
<h3>×'s Internal Emptiness Leads to Rampant Robberies in Guangzhou - × Plans to Transfer Zhu Sheng Bing to Be in Charge of Security in the City - Our Guerrilla Team Achieves Victory in a Night Attack on Guangya Academy</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou Express] The × army entrenched in Guangzhou is terrified by our attacks on various lines. News of this has been repeatedly reported. In recent days, the situation in Guangzhou has become even more chaotic, and the panic among the × army is even greater than before. A summary of the events is recorded below:</p>
<p>Rumors of Zhu Sheng Bing Being Transferred as Puppet Mayor</p>
<p>Since surrendering to the ×, Zhu Sheng Bing (i.e., Luo Bing) has spared no effort to ingratiate himself with the ×, attempting to win their favor. It has been found that the Luo traitor participated in several battles in which the × army attacked Jiangzeng after capturing Daliang Ronggui, and he also dispatched a group of ugly characters to assist the × troops in their invasion. Therefore, he has gained the appreciation of the × army. Recently, due to insufficient strength, the × army on various routes has transferred most of the × in Guangzhou to supplement them, resulting in internal emptiness. It is rumored that Ando, the commander of the southward invading ×, is planning to transfer the Luo traitor to serve as the puppet mayor of Guangzhou, responsible for maintaining order in the city. Luo's henchmen have recently infiltrated Guangzhou one after another, engaging in large-scale activities.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Team Attacks Guangya Academy</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been poor recently, with continuous spring rain. On the 27th, the guerrilla team ambushing in the suburbs of the city learned that a large number of military supplies of the × army were stored in Guangya Academy in Xicun. That night, at about 1:00 AM, led by a certain Liang, they sneaked towards the × through the lychee groves for a night attack. The moonlight was dim, and they advanced quickly with muffled steps. When they arrived, the × troops stationed at the academy were still unaware. Our guerrilla team suddenly rushed in, first killing two × sentries. They then launched a fierce grenade attack on the × inside the academy, firing more than a hundred grenades continuously, and set fire to the × army's camps. Then, they retreated.</p>
<p>Disorderly Order in Guangzhou City</p>
<p>The × army in Guangzhou is terrified because it has been thinned out and because our guerrilla team is active. Since the 25th, they have only been on guard in the city during the day. At 6:00 PM, they all retreat to the suburbs, daring not to stay overnight in the city. As a result, local ruffians and rogues have been active in the city, and incidents of robbery and theft occur frequently. It has been found that at about 10:00 PM on the 27th, more than twenty thieves broke into the Japanese-owned Qiao Ye store in Dongqiaokou through a broken tile roof and a wooden door in the sky, secretly opened the front door, and stole a batch of valuables. As they were preparing to escape, they were discovered by Ling Ye, a clerk of the × store, who blew a whistle to call the police. The gang of thieves immediately drew their guns and shot him repeatedly, killing two × store clerks on the spot. The × military police rushed to rescue them after receiving the report, but the gang of thieves had already fled. The disorderly order in Guangzhou city is evident from this.</p>
<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>Challenging America - The Rise of French Films - Low Production Costs Surprise Hollywood</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities of American film companies received information from officials stationed in France that the low production costs of French films were a great surprise. It is said that French film company managers maintain the principle of keeping the cost of producing a film to no more than two million francs. At the current exchange rate, two million francs is equivalent to only US$50,000. Compared to the production costs of films made in Hollywood, the difference is truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>(1) Unexpected Success</p>
<p>French films are produced at such low costs, yet films like "Un Carnet de Bal," "Lo Mioche," "Grande Illusion," and "Ballerina" have achieved unexpected success when released in the United States. French film companies are hoping to send more productions across the Atlantic to be released in the United States in 1939, and the cost of these films will be kept below US$100,000.</p>
<p>(2) Expense Allocation</p>
<p>If we conduct further research, we find that even the most expensive French films cost no more than 2.8 million francs. The themes of most scripts are based on modern novels or stories, and the writers receive 5% of the cost, which is at most 140,000 francs. An ordinary director also receives 5% of the cost. The main cast members generally receive 25%, the technical staff 15%, and the cost of the film studio will be several hundred thousand francs. The rest is allocated to writing, composition, costumes, set design, and film stock. This method of allocation is completely different from that in Hollywood. The salaries of technical staff are higher than those of actors. The salaries of male and female stars, even the highest paid, are far lower than those of major Hollywood stars. However, the cost of various set designs is very high in French films. Many films are made in cooperation with the French army or navy.</p>
<p>(3) Films Not Made</p>
<p>There are very few French musicals and not many films featuring scantily clad women or chorus lines. All dangerous events, such as volcanic eruptions, rising tides, hurricanes, fires, icebergs, and hippos, are not filmed due to the high costs involved.</p>
<p>(4) Challenging America</p>
<p>Because of its emphasis on realism, French films focus on romance. The recent production of films imitating typical American blockbusters shows that they are only challenging Hollywood, and American critics have already pointed out that France has several stars who will amaze people.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Stars' Standards for Choosing a Spouse</h3>
<p>A French reporter went to Hollywood to inquire about the conditions that local male stars look for in a spouse (note: this refers only to appearance, physique, and character; other conditions such as property, profession, and education are not discussed). According to the male stars' opinions:</p>
<p>(1) They love women with auburn hair because most of these women are beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) They admire slim women (of course, not women who are thin as a rail or weak and frail). They do not consider women athletes with plenty of curves to be their ideal partners. There is a popular saying in Hollywood: "A curve is not the shortest distance from one point to another, so it is not an interesting line." This saying fully expresses their dislike of muscular bodies.</p>
<p>(3) They love women who are happy, cheerful, lively, and slightly silly because marrying such a woman can easily comfort a husband in daily life and help him forget the hard work. On the contrary, marrying a woman who is sad all day long is like putting a machine for creating trouble and tragedy in the house.</p>
<p>According to the female stars' opinions on choosing a husband:</p>
<p>(1) They love to marry men with brown hair because most American men have brown hair. Men with black and dark hair are not welcome because dark hair makes the face appear unkind.</p>
<p>(2) They love tall and thin men with long legs.</p>
<p>(3) They love men who are natural, unconstrained, tell jokes well, and have a heroic spirit. Silent, gentlemanly Englishmen are considered the most boring.</p>

<h3>Husband, Wife, Friend</h3>
<p>Produced by Twentieth Century Fox</p>
<p>Starring</p>
<p>Dorothy - Loretta Young</p>
<p>Leona - Warner Baxter</p>
<p>Hugo - Cesar Romero</p>
<p>Leona quickly moved her lips away from the wine glass, cocking an ear to listen at the door, faintly hearing Dorothy singing "Mi Mi Mi—" at the other end of the room.</p>
<p>She felt a chill on her back, as if a cold wind had blown over her. The Persian rug on the floor also seemed to turn into a pile of snow under her feet, and a look of doubt appeared on her dark and strong face.</p>
<p>White also heard it, and he shook his white-haired head and snorted, gulping down the wine in his glass and saying, "Misfortune in the White family! I knew it! My child, you really shouldn't have gone to the opera tonight. I understand that it has started again, that cursed thing has been born again!"</p>
<p>"But," Leona replied, "Dorothy doesn't really want to be in the singing profession. When we got married, I simply told her that she would go crazy if she kept doing this, and she immediately abandoned her own ideas. That was five years ago. She hasn't mentioned it until now." He added doubtfully, "Of course, I didn't ask her for a definite promise."</p>
<p>White snorted again. He felt that he was Dorothy's father and knew his daughter's character very well. He asked, "Why didn't you let her work hard to pursue her aspirations and become a successful singer?"</p>
<p>Leona stammered, "I have my reasons."</p>
<p>"I understand," White said solemnly, then sighed. "In 1860, Dorothy's grandmother ran away from home to sing on the stage in Florence. That was the result of the Civil War. Dorothy's mother wanted to become an opera singer every year for twenty-seven years. For twenty-seven winters, she rented a hall and sang there - only herself. Now Dorothy is doing the same."</p>
<p>Leona didn't speak, lighting a cigarette in distress.</p>
<p>White continued, "I don't think her singing is the worst in the world! It's good enough to sing in church or in the living room, but to go to a concert or opera stage—ha, what a joke!" He glanced at Leona, "You know this, I know this, and everyone knows it, only the women in the White family don't know it. Music has a special tradition in this family. It was very unfortunate for Dorothy's mother. I think the failure in the twenty-seventh year can finally put an end to it. I tell you, the first time I heard my daughter practicing singing, I immediately ran to the club, locked the door, and hid in the room for five days without eating anything!"</p>
<p>"Mi Mi Mi Mi…!" Dorothy's singing came from afar.</p>
<p>Then there was a sound of the door opening, and Miss White's voice said, "Beautiful, I love it!" Even though she was so quick-tongued, White didn't have time to put down his wine glass and pretend that he hadn't been drinking, she had already walked in, and as soon as she saw him, she showed an angry expression, said good night, and went out.</p>
<p>The White couple's family had a high social status. When Dorothy and Leona got married, she was furious. Leona, although a successful contractor, was just an ordinary businessman. The young couple was indeed passionately in love, but what use was that for the glory of the world?</p>
<p>Dorothy, who deeply loved her husband, often joked that Leona's ancestors had no glory, and that he resembled them very much. She sat in front of the mirror in the dressing room, holding a blue slipper in her hand, striking poses as she spoke. She had not yet taken off her white evening dress, which made her fair shoulders and bright golden hair even more prominent. Leona said she was a beauty from a book. He said, "Listen, your eyes are bluer than the sapphires on your earrings!"</p>

<h3>Today's Doubles Tennis Semifinals - Defending Champions vs. Newcomers - Xu Brothers vs. Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The island's tennis players are active regardless of the cold or heat. Now that the soccer season has just ended, the tennis matches have become intense again.</p>
<p>This year's lawn tennis tournament has an especially large number of participants, so the competition days have been extended. It started in early March and has lasted for two months. During the competition, the weak have been eliminated, and the strong have been retained. We are now at the final stage.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM today, there will be a doubles semifinal match between the Xu brothers (Pei Run and Pei) and Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi. The competition will be held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club field.</p>
<p>The Xu brothers soared to fame in the previous tournament, and their reputation has increased tenfold. Their skills have improved even more, and it is expected that they will retain the championship this time.</p>
<p>Lin and Huang are newcomers, and they both have considerable skills, but they are still inferior to the Xu brothers. It is expected that victory will undoubtedly belong to the Xu brothers.</p>
<p>Looking at recent trends, the doubles championship will be contested by the Xu brothers and the Lin Zhen brothers. However, although the Xu brothers have been invincible in the recent past and have reached this near-championship position, their past performances have been erratic, sometimes far from their normal standards. Now that it has reached a critical moment, they must be careful in their response. If they complete this victory, they will be one step closer to the championship. (Dong Lang)</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Second Division Basketball Matches Were Fiercely Contested - Green Team's Zhong Sheng and Guangzhong Victorious - Tonight's Three Matches Are All Worth Watching - Green Team Defeats Red Star</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Three Second Division matches were held yesterday for the Open Men's Basketball Tournament. In the first match, the Green Team played against the Red Star. The Green Team was stronger and had better coordination. They repeatedly broke through the Red Star's formation with surprise attacks, and then used flanking attacks. Therefore, after resisting, the Red Star lost 28-39.</p>

<p>Zhong Sheng Defeats Qing Zhi</p>
<p>In the second match, Qing Zhi played against Zhong Sheng. From the start, Qing Zhi showed its sharpness, with five riders advancing side by side and achieving gains. However, Zhong Sheng did not show weakness, resisting the attacking force on one hand and counterattacking during the gaps on the other hand. Therefore, it developed into a very tense situation. At the end of the first half, Qing Zhi only led by a narrow margin of 23-20. After changing baskets, Qing Zhi's momentum was like that of a rainbow, attacking tirelessly. Zhong Sheng responded calmly and defended effectively. Later, because Qing Zhi's repeated attacks failed, their morale was frustrated, and Zhong Sheng took the opportunity to attack fiercely, causing them to be busy coping and their formation to gradually become chaotic. As a result, Zhong Sheng reversed the defeat and won 50-45.</p>

<p>Guangzhong Defeats Guan Lei</p>
<p>In the final match, Guan Lei played against Guangzhong. Both sides had strong players and the match was fiercely contested. After the game started, they fought fiercely for a long time and were evenly matched, first tying at 4-4. Later, Chen Qiangchu and Feng Zehong of Guangzhong advanced on two fronts, frequently sending good news. Chuan Yu Kui and Xu Zhen of Guan Lei then struggled to defend and retaliate. Therefore, the two armies engaged in a melee at this time, which was extremely intense. At the end of the first half, Guangzhong had the advantage with 20-16. In the second half, Guan Lei exerted all its strength and frequently put pressure on Guangzhong's position. Guangzhong also tried its best to compete. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Guan Lei's offense and defense gradually became unsustainable. Guangzhong then took the opportunity to pounce fiercely, causing Guan Lei to be attacked on all sides. At the end of the game, Guan Lei lost 38-47.</p>

<h3>Popularizing School Sports: Increasing General Classes is Necessary</h3>
<p>— Excellence</p>
<p>Regarding school sports in Hong Kong, due to environmental factors and the problem of space, the development of school sports has faced significant obstacles. Especially after the motherland launched the War of Resistance, students flocked to Hong Kong for safety and education, leading to a sudden increase in the student population. Each school and class has an unmanageable number of students. Just imagine, how can so many students actively exercise together in a small space? Furthermore, due to environmental factors, many schools have leaned towards gymnastic equipment exercises. Although these exercises are good, many students are not suited to them due to their physical condition, and teachers must not blindly implement them, lest they harm the students' physical and mental health. Nor can teaching be tailored only to the few students who are suited to them. As a result, many students cannot enjoy the benefits of physical education training during regular class time and can only stand idly by. If the students are a bit more mischievous, their attempts to observe can lead to many disruptions to the order of instruction. In my personal opinion, if we want to encourage students to work hard during regular classes and make up for the lack of training for students who miss classes, it is necessary to increase general classes. For example, recently, Chung Wah Middle School, feeling that many of its students were pampered and weak and that many parents even directly asked the school for leave during regular classes, preventing them from enjoying physical education training and thus not adapting to the demands of the current extraordinary times, decided to add fitness classes. These classes are specifically designed for weak students. All those who do not work hard at exercise during regular classes or are unable to attend regular training must enter these classes for training. This class can be created to meet the school's needs. In my personal opinion, the most suitable curriculum for this class would be lively games, gymnastics, and therapeutic exercises. Whether this is suitable, I urge comrades to correct. I have said a lot that seems irrelevant to this article, and it may even seem like I am promoting something specific, but this is a bit of fact, a real example. It is to form a lively class from the students who are relatively weak, dispirited, and do not work hard at exercise during regular classes, and to provide them with suitable teaching materials, to intensify training, and to strive for the health of all students in the school. I believe that there are many schools in Hong Kong that are in the same environment as this school, and such classes are indeed closely related to the popularization of school sports. I will now elaborate on what I have seen: (1)</p>
<h3>Swimming Guide: Breaststroke (2)</h3>
<p>— Pan Congshao</p>
<p>At the beginning of the entire movement, the posture should not involve the head being raised too high, the body excessively tilted, or the entire posture being deeply submerged in the water. The latter makes breathing more difficult due to the increased pressure from the depth of the water. Both bad postures clearly indicate that the body is not floating effectively. Try to float in the water with the body forming a straight line, and the problems of the body being too exposed or too submerged will quickly diminish.</p>
<p>Continued practice is necessary for improving the breaststroke. General swimming practice usually involves swimming from one end of a 25-meter to 50-meter pool to the other in continuous breaststroke movements. What also needs attention is the turning method. When the body swims to a point still about a foot away from the end of the pool, taking advantage of the forward movement of the body, the body, if possible, should have the left hand touch the pool wall (or turning board), and exerting force downwards to the right. At this time, the upper body is approaching the edge of the pool. Once the right hand adds force to the wall, the upper body flips over in direction, and the sole of the foot is against the pool wall. Without any delay, use the limbs to gather near the pool edge, and in a bent and suitable posture, vigorously push off with the foot, propelling the straightened body forward. The force of this turn can propel the body through a distance of more than five meters in the water. The posture for turning in breaststroke does not allow for deviation; both hands must touch the edge of the pool together. If turning to the left, the left hand that is touching the pool edge must simultaneously move further to the left, bringing the body closer to the edge of the pool. When the body is directly facing left, both feet must be ready to stick to the edge of the pool to propel the body forward.</p>
<p>Turning is a good opportunity for the limbs to rest. Especially as the body moves forward away from the edge of the pool, the limbs are stretched straight, and the muscles are constantly working hard. Resting at this point is particularly useful for those participating in swimming competitions. If you have plenty of energy, you don't need to exhale before turning, but if you are not skilled, you will feel tired after exhaling and pressing down in the water while moving forward after turning.</p>
<p>The breaststroke movement is also necessary for underwater swimming. To swim underwater, it is not necessary to adopt its posture; the breaststroke movement is the most suitable. A previous article has already been published regarding underwater swimming practice methods. (The End)</p>
<h3>Track and Field Results of Two Schools</h3>
<p>The Wah Yan College Old Boys' Association held its second annual track and field meet yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Caroline Hill South Sports Ground. Former and current students and guests, numbering in the hundreds, attended, and the atmosphere was quite lively. The event concluded at 2:30 PM with very satisfactory results. The schedule included events such as the all-Hong Kong reporters' open 100-meter race, the open 400-meter relay, the 50-meter children's race, and the 100-meter wartime relief fund mixed relay race. The children's race was particularly amusing. When this group of young children competed in the race, their lively and innocent attitude deeply interested the spectators. Next was the mixed relay race. After all the races were completed, Professor Binney of Hong Kong University presented the awards. The tea party at 4:00 PM ended with joy and satisfaction.</p>

<h3>The Development of Poetry</h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>Poets greet the arrival of the great era with fervent singing.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the national liberation struggle stirs up a tide of emotion in the hearts of poets; the flames of national liberation struggle temper the sinews and bones of poets, enabling them to gradually overcome the erroneous tendencies of sectarianism and individualism; at the same time, the establishment of the national united front and the gradual development of mass movements provide excellent conditions for the development of the poetry movement, and the advocacy and practice of popularizing poetry is the broad road for poetry to move forward.</p>
<p>Poets have gained new life in creation during the struggle, and the vigorous atmosphere of the poetry movement is unprecedented. However, our harvest is far from full, and better achievements still depend on the continuous efforts of poets; we do not have enough workers, and the poetry movement has not yet been fully developed; in particular, our movement has not yet formed a close link with the lives of the people, and the poets' tempering of their lives and practical experience needs to be stepped up and strengthened.</p>
<p>An author said that the manuscripts received by literary publications are mostly poetry; however, each publication is limited to poetry occupying one-eighth of the whole, and writers are also constrained, so poetry cannot expand. This statement is questionable. The fact that publications receive so much poetry shows that there are relatively the largest number of poetry authors, but it also shows that poetry authors have a casual attitude. It is not the publication that is hindering the expansion of poetry, but rather that the efforts of poetry authors are not enough, and they must bear the greatest responsibility.</p>
<p>In the early days of the War of Resistance, poets were captured by the phenomenon of the outbreak of the struggle and, almost without thinking or experiencing, poured out their fiery emotions on paper, issuing poems of shouting, roaring, and screaming. This was a surge of romanticism, which stimulated, incited, and inspired, and fulfilled such a task in the early days of the War of Resistance. Poetry is a product of society, and the reality of the early days of the War of Resistance determined the 'initial nature' of anti-Japanese war poetry at that time.</p>
<p>However, the surge of shouting-style poetry fell into the quagmire of sloganization and formulaization. The arrangement of slogans and labels lacked emotional integration and lacked true images, thus losing the life and power of poetry. This crooked path of creation has now been criticized by comparison. Mu Mutian said it well: "During this period of resistance and nation-building, we must be romantic in emotion and realistic in cognition. A poet in his own era should be a romanticist, and at the same time, he should also be a realist... There must be a strong romantic emotion in a poem, and at the same time, there must be a strong realistic image."</p>
<p>In fact, poets have also stopped from the stage of shouting and moved towards the road of lyricism with flesh and blood, from coarse to meticulous, from emotional impulse to the deepening of human emotion, from concepts to images. This is the progress of poets. Jiang Bishun's "The Struggle for Tianzhu Tian" and "Don't Cry! Twist Your Head," and Chang Min's "Sacrifice" and "Road" are all clear signs. All poetry workers should run together on this road to achieve the complete liquidation of slogan-formula poetry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the poetry movement must form a close link with the lives of the people, and the development of poetry will have a brighter future. Poets have accepted the instruction of this theory and are using poetry reading as a concrete route of practice. On the one hand, they use poetry reading to educate the people, and on the other hand, they gain education in this practice, achieving the completion of the popularization of poetry. This kind of effort is worthy of cherishing.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to point out that in order for poetry to be accepted by the masses, not only must the form be suitable for the masses, be catchy, and use the vocabulary of the masses, but the content must also be suitable for the masses, reflect the lives of the masses, and use meaningful things that have happened and are happening in the masses as the content of poetry. Narrative poetry is the most popular among the masses, and the creation of great narrative poems is precisely the highest demand of the revolution on poets. Then, lyrical poetry should gradually give way to narrative poetry. Naturally, there is no clear distinction between lyrical poetry and narrative poetry.</p>
<h3>"Candy" and "Whip"</h3>
<p>— Yin Sanlang</p>
<p>According to reports, fascist countries consistently use the "candy" and "whip" policy.</p>
<p>"Candy" and "whip" seem to be non-opposing terms, but in fact, if we observe the current world dynamics and are not too forgetful, we will definitely feel that the so-called "candy" and "whip" are indeed very connected.</p>
<p>Opening up the newspapers of the past half-year is full of great achievements regarding "candy" and "whip." Isn't it? Those small countries in Eastern Europe, like Czechoslovakia, Albania, Spain, etc., have suffered the pain of the "whip" under the temptation of "candy."</p>
<p>Fascist countries rely on their weapons and want to seize and snatch from the east and west every day to get some benefits. But mankind has a natural wit and intelligence, so if fascist aggression is coveting it, the first step will never be to reveal its original hideous face. It must use the old trick of stealing candy from adults and deceiving children to seduce it with "candy." Therefore, they first sign some economic agreements, military agreements, etc., with a small country, and when that country is hesitating and considering, it sounds very palatable. Once the first step of the "candy" strategy has succeeded, they gradually reveal their original ferocious appearance. By the time they realize they have been fooled and want to change direction, it is too late, and they have already tasted the most vicious taste of the "whip."</p>
<p>Although the universe is large, the principles are the same. Even if we look closer at that fascist ally in the Far East, isn't it playing the same trick? Before the "July 7th" Incident, it consistently used "candy" such as "Sino-Japanese Friendship," "Economic Cooperation," and "Coexistence and Co-prosperity" to gift us. At that time, we really felt it was a matter of "disrespectful to refuse, and painful to accept."</p>
<p>Today, as it uses the "whip" to intensify its beating and reveals its true colors, it is still distributing those beautiful "candies" in the occupied areas. Things like "Establishing a New Order in East Asia" and "Reviving a New China" are all despicable tricks of adults deceiving children. What is regrettable is that there are no complete fools in the world who will always taste its "candy" without feeling the bitterness.</p>
<p>Now, those who have eaten its "candy" and suffered the taste of the "whip" have all understood and have firmly raised the "whip of justice" in their hands to resist the beating of the invaders' "unreasonable whip." And I believe that in the near future, there will be a day when the "whip of justice" shatters the "tyrannical whip"!</p>
<h3>The Songs of the Dragons</h3>
<p>— Wallflower</p>
<p>On a starless evening, amidst the sounds of a bustling orchestra and the drunken revelry, I left the inevitable feast and walked alone to this desolate corner.</p>
<p>Abandoned by the happy people, this desolate corner!</p>
<p>Sadly, a few scattered pedestrians, like ghosts, moved silently.</p>
<p>(In the distance, on the dark plain, a fierce beast guards the night!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a magnificent and impassioned song burst out from the long circle of walls on the other side, interwoven with anger and valor.</p>
<p>A shadow crossed my heart:</p>
<p>I remembered that locked up inside this secluded wall were eight hundred biting dragons! They had a glorious and immortal history! Now, they only had their rainbow-like heroism, but were deprived of their freedom and burdened with chains!</p>
<p>They dwell in seclusion in lonely days, and a surge of passion to protect their motherland, as well as accusations against the enemy, naturally turned into a song, broadcast in the night space.</p>
<p>Oh, magnificent and impassioned song, you tremble the darkness, tremble the universe!</p>
<p>My heart beats even more with the agitation!</p>
<h3>Mouth of the Fengchuan River (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Du Wenhui</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the distant azure sky, two enemy planes painted with the Rising Sun emblem were spotted, flying towards our boat. The first to see them were the owners of these brick and tile boats. He was an old man in his fifties, very experienced in navigating the West River. He was a kind and timid merchant. As soon as he saw the enemy planes, he panicked and shouted frantically, "Quickly moor the boats! Quick—ly! Quick! Quick!" His companions were rushing to moor the boats, shouting without experience, running in all directions, some taking out their only cloth bundles or even cotton quilts and clothes from the cabins, carrying them on their shoulders and running ashore. But the most pitiful was the old man; what could he take away? The bricks and tiles on these boats were all his livelihood and property.</p>
<p>He was so frightened that his face turned pale, and his body and teeth were trembling. He asked me pleadingly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Du, what should we do? Everything is finished... If I am bombed to death, you must tell my family!... " He spread his hands in despair.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, old man. Calm down and come with me to take shelter!..." I comforted him, and I dragged his trembling, frail hand ashore. He was a little attached to the boat.</p>
<p>The embankment was empty. Only about ten feet away from the embankment was a lychee tree like a crab claw flower, and we crouched in the sparse shade of the tree to hide. At this time, the enemy plane was circling over the boat, scouting whether the boat was carrying troops. The old man suddenly became afraid of death. He wanted to run to the distant village. I knew his intention, so I pulled my hand back, pointed at him, and said:</p>
<p>"Don't run, old man! Otherwise, I will shoot you! If you leave now, the enemy plane will spot the target..." He was even more afraid, but he finally submitted timidly. He kept muttering:</p>
<p>"If I am bombed to death, you must tell my family." I found him a bit pitiful and ridiculous. Wasn't I with him? If he was bombed to death, I certainly wouldn't be an exception.</p>
<p>The enemy plane dropped three black objects. One fell into the paddy field on the opposite bank, and two fell on the brick and tile boats and exploded. The old man shouted hysterically, but it was drowned out by the deafening sound of the bombing. Sand and gravel flew all over the banks and into the river, and the other boats were shaken crooked or overturned.</p>
<p>Black smoke and flames filled the sky. The enemy plane circled for a while and flew towards the distant azure. The old man's weeping could be heard clearly. He was crying for the loss of his property! A few minutes after the enemy plane left, the old man and I walked to the embankment, his eyes wet. Tears were hanging on his cheeks.</p>
<p>Broken bricks and tiles were scattered here and there on both banks and in the river. Broken boat planks filled the river, some still spewing smoke and fire. The old man sat on the embankment in despair until his companions returned from the distant village, and he seemed to wake up from a dream and told his companions to collect the few wooden boats that had not been bombed.</p>
<p>It took all day to finally repair his remaining boats. At dusk, our boat gradually drifted away from the mouth of the river in the darkness of the night, surrounded by a group of curious farmers. The old man was deeply plunged into sorrow. I comforted him along the way until we reached Zhaoqing.</p>
<p>That night in Zhaoqing, the old man jumped into the river in the middle of the night. When our companions discovered it, the old man had already been swept away by the turbid flood of the West River.</p>
<p>The next day at dawn, when the autumn sun shone on the cliffs of the Seven Star Crags, I looked out at the withered reeds under the rocks and the shadows of a few fishing boats. I commemorated the kind and timid old man with a painful and regretful feeling. I remembered that he had told me: "If I am bombed to death, you must tell my family!" Yes, I will tell his family! But why did the old man die? I felt a little lost! It was as if I was sitting in a fog. I noticed the reeds beside the boat, which had a little bit of saltiness on them. Were these not the tears on the old man's cheeks? Oh, I understand, that's why he died!</p>
<p>(End)</p>
<h3>Mr. Lu</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xu</p>
<p>Mr. Lu was again expressing his profound views there, his head shaking back and forth, the veins on his forehead bulging out:</p>
<p>"Ah, the current Chinese people are really awful... Um... That's why I say: everyone over the age of ten should die... Yes: should all die..." He deliberately repeated the last sentence emphatically. His head shook triumphantly a couple more times.</p>
<p>"Then what about you? Should you die too? What a pity!" Someone was teasing him jokingly.</p>
<p>"Um, that, that, that of course, let my children live, and let them reform China..." His face flushed even redder.</p>
<p>"Ha... But your two daughters... When they ask people for candy, their skill is no less than those officials who were good at fleecing the people in the past!"</p>
<p>"Um... that..."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" It caused a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu was just a young man in his thirties, but he always loved to express these pedantic and nonsensical empty talks. Sometimes, if his colleagues asked him:</p>
<p>"Then what about our old principal? Should he die too?"</p>
<p>He would then say contemptuously: "Oh! Of course! To be honest: these old men in their fifties and sixties are all useless. Look at the traitors of those two puppet governments, aren't they all in their fifties and sixties?..."</p>
<p>"But... Mr. Lu... how old is your esteemed father?"</p>
<p>"Oh!... that... that..." Then there was another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's esteemed father was over sixty, but he still left home despite the hardship, following the government westward to serve the country; however, Mr. Lu himself, when the government moved to Hankou, said:</p>
<p>"Um: I should resign!... My family is still in Shanghai..." So he ran back! Leaving his old father alone there.</p>
<p>When people said that he should go to the interior to serve the country and take care of his old father, he would flush red again and stammer:</p>
<p>"Um... that... that... There are also many jobs in Shanghai... Moreover... I still have a family..."</p>
<h3>Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Who is it? It is China!"</p>
<p>A humorous beginning, a painful ending.</p>
<p>It is difficult to convince a person, but easy to let life influence them, and it is also the most effective. Therefore, she was pacing restlessly in that room that was temporarily her own. Her steps were so heavy and messy; as if matching the rhythm of her heavy and messy thoughts. In the rise and fall of her steps, time was being prolonged so indecisively. In this monotonous and slow movement, it seemed as if she was saying, wasn't the motherland the sacred poem praised by poets? Wasn't it the glorious burial ground where heroes and warriors of the past sacrificed to defend it? It seemed as if she was saying, are they the modern heroes and warriors? It seemed as if she was saying, could her father be the traitor to the motherland cursed by the general public—their opposite? It seemed as if she was saying, in between these two, where exactly should she go?... The disturbing and unforgettable thoughts were distressing. She clenched her fists and kept hitting the palm of her other hand. She wished to replace the worries of thoughts with physical pain. Her fair and tender hands—a part of all her beauty—were beaten until they looked as if they had been dyed red by cherry juice, but she still could not smooth out the wrinkles of worry in her heart. When she stamped the floor, she was already crying. The tears of the weak are not precious.</p>
<p>Her crying startled the only acquaintance, who came to see her—with love on one hand and surveillance on the other. He looked at her beautiful face, which was after all much more haggard than when he had seen her last night, but still resembled a fresh flower, making people love her, still making it difficult to believe that she was the daughter of a vile traitor. At this moment, he even thought of a fresh flower—she, its growing place, why was it not a pure and holy place, but a dirty garbage heap—her father. He also looked at her chest, beating unevenly, and the bright, crystal-like teardrops on her face. He was worried that such a small life as hers could not withstand too much trauma. Therefore, he silently cursed her father—the traitor to the motherland. Her father's crimes were not hers, so why was she suffering for her father? Could it be that the misfortune of the innocent will always exist in this world?</p>
