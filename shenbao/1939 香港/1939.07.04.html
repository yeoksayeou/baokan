<h3>增進戰時財政實力的新法令</h3>
<p>昨天報載財政部於前日公佈兩個新的法令，其一是非常時期禁止進口物品辦法」，其二是「出口貨物結匯領取　價差額辦法」。這是適應我國目前迫切需要增强抗戰建國實力的戰時法令。</p>
<p>當上月漢幣跌價之時，本報卽曾一再献議我國爲從經齊上打擊×人，不僅卽須實施澈底的外滙統制，並須進而實施貿易統制。因爲衹有這樣，才能切實鞏固及增强抗戰財政的實力，而實現最後戰勝日×。</p>
<p>現在財部公佈的，前一法令，其目的在於維持國際收支的平衡，因爲我國平昔就是一個入超的國家，而抗戰時期所需國防用具，舉凡軍事，交通，工業用品，更多仰給於國外；然抗戰以來，一切進口物品，未能實施統制。更說不到配合抗戰建國的需要。外滙之無謂消耗，直接間接，都給我們抗戰建國事業以損害；加以最近日×漢奸，旣用僞幣大量套取我國外滙，而不少昧却天良不顧國家民族利害的份子，又千方百計的潛移資金。影響外滙，因此我國戰時財政，更受影響。現在財部這個禁止進口物品的辦法，就同時足以打擊日×漢奸的陰謀，而挽救日趨嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>從整個國家的族利益說，這一法令是我們每一個國民都應竭誠擁護的。因為我們禁止若干戰時不急需的物品及奢侈性的物品，在國家旣可多得外滙，藉以購買抗戰建國必需的物品，藉以戰勝日×爭取最後勝利，保障民族解放與幸福；同時，在社會及我國民本身說，亦可消弭奢侈淫靡，改造社會風氣，爲未來建國預建基礙。至於國際方面，友邦對華輸出商人，雖然一時遭受相當影響，但我政府此舉，完全針對目前遠東形勢，保衛安定秩序，亦可謂爲保障我國與友邦的共同利益，友邦人士，自當同情。何况國防性物品輸入增加。結果或更將有利於民主和平的友邦！</p>
<p>財部第二個法令，則完全爲了解除商民的困難，促進出口貿易，從出口增加來增進戰時生產，使國民經濟愈增鞏固。因此，這一法令不僅是目前克服困難，支持抗戰，打擊×人所必需，而且也可爲未來建立理想的國家預建基礎。我們希望政府這個實際足以保護工商實業家與提高戰時生產建設的法令，能够切實付諸實施，並且加緊進行宣傳解釋工作，不僅要在國內展開廣泛的生產動員工作，並且要在廣大的華僑和友邦實業家中間，鼓勵其投資開發我內地生產事業的熱忱。</p>
<p>抑更有進者，財部這兩個新法令，在若干人士認爲稍嫌實施過遲，其實，這完全是整個國際形勢與找國所處半殖民地地位的特殊條件所使然，但是我國堅持團結抗戰兩年的結果，已使這些主觀的與客觀的特殊條件，開始重大的變化；因此我財部乃得以應各方的獻議而公布這兩個新法令，且深信其必能收獲預期的效果了！我們在這裏申預見中華民族必能最後戰勝×人爭得獨立自由幸福的遠景！</p>

<h3>平地游擊戰爭論</h3>
<p>— 周士梯</p>
<p>【三】游擊兵團或正規兵團，在廣大地區被×圍攻時：</p>
<p>第一，以少數兵力及盡量使用游擊隊，在各方面擾擊箝制×人，破壞交通園繞於×人彰後左右，使各路×人不能按照原定計劃同時進到所要到達的地點，並以疲勞×人，造成×人的弱點與過失，使我軍能集中主力，在有利條件下，在×分進而未合擊前，打×一路（主要戰鬥方式是夜襲或伏擎），但是不要把『打×一路』的原則，機械的去了解和運用。</p>
<p>第二，如情况不許可集中主力打×一路時，則可將主力分散（但不是平均分散兵力），主力方向仍是主力（雖各支兵力相等，但分配地區的疏密程度是不相同的），一方向使×人找不到我主力而合　（使×兵分進而不能合擊）；另方面亦能造成×人的困難，混亂×人圍攻部署，有時亦可使×人進攻停止，有時亦能造成×人的弱點與過失，而使於我再找尋有利時機予×以打擊。</p>
<p>第三，如×人兵力甚優，情况又不許可大部隊留在該地區時，則以一部或游擊隊留在該地區，分散擾擊×人，而主力向另一地區轉移。但應注意適時的轉移，過早過遲都要不得，因爲一方面游擊地區周圍都有×人，有時×人施行僞騙的調動，有時虛張聲勢而無進攻企圖時，如不弄淸×情便轉移，是從勞無益的；另一方面×已實行圍攻，而我偵察不周密，不能及時知道×之企圖，甚至於　傲，疏忽，沒有準備，等到×人包圍形勢已成，方手忙脚亂的調動，這亦是錯誤的。因此轉移過遲過早，都是要不得，這須依靠於領導機關有很好的偵察，細心的正確的情况判斷。</p>
<p>（四）在小地區被×圍攻時：較大的游擊兵團或正規兵團，除了有一定的戰鬥任務之外，不應在校小而不易迥旋的地區活動。（如在×各據點之間之狹小地區）。小地區中活動的，通常游擊隊妁任務。在小地區中活動的游擊隊，被圍攻時，不應機械地了解集中主力打×一路的原則，一般的是集中的轉移，以游擊動作打擊×人，這裏最好是使用小部隊（最好是便衣）轉到×側後方活動。</p>
<p>（五）×人圍攻時，應有積極的作戰企圖，盡一切可能打擊×人。粉碎其圍攻，如無可能時！則及時轉移兵力，以游擊隊作打圈旋轉，脫離×人。在我轉移時，有好多地方是曾被×佔領的，可是×人兵力有限，要把廣大地區都分兵佔領是不可能的。在×人已佔領的地方，應不斷的去打擊×人，使×人困難，恐慌，結果這些地方往往又可以恢復的。</p>
<p>四　隨時準備戰鬬</p>
<p>在平地上，要隨時準備行動與戰鬥，平地×人活動力較山地大，緊急情况可能隨時發生，在平地活動的部隊，都要隨時準備行動，隨時準備戰爭，因此要注意如下事項：</p>
<p>（1）不論部隊或機關，特一別是機關中的文件，辦公用具，器械等，應經常裝好，如需要使用時，隨時拿出放入，不要隨便亂放。</p>
<p>（2）不論戰鬥部隊或機關，都應是輕裝的，龐大的後方機關，和部隊中携帶很多笨重的行李担子騾馬，都是要不得的。</p>
<p>（3）內務整理要合乎戰爭要求，包袱，毯子應經常綑好，一般的不知將毯子疊成乃四方放於床中間的內務方式。</p>
<p>五　保守軍事秘密</p>
<p>秘密是保障戰爭咪利的基本條件之一，如我們兵力和行動企圖被×人預先知道，雖是很勇敢與堅决，往往是不易取得勝利的，有時且會受到危險的，所以保守軍事秘密，是保障障鬥勝利的基本條件之一。我□□旅於十一月十一日在張家灣附近伏擊×軍，×人事前並未發覺，故能將×旅團長常崗寬治所率數百人全部消滅，我□□團十一月十七日在明堡附近伏擊×人，亦將三十五輛汽車的×人及軍用品等全部消滅與繳獲；我□□旅在五台以南四十里之中座腦上一帶待機數天，由於封鎖消息，嚴守秘密，五台之×始終末能發覺，故缺野大隊才敢于十一月二日夜間去襲擊洪口鎭，三日夜間又轉囘五台，而在滑石片附近被我全部消滅，又如十一月二十九日，我呂團在直堡以南伏擊×人，呂團在靈邱以北伏擊×人，因企圖暴露，結果不能取得勝利，以上這些都是實在的例子。</p>
<p>平地村莊綿密，道路諸多，封銷消息，較山地爲難，同時×探漢奸活動亦因此對於保守秘密更要注意，我們怎樣去嚴守秘密呢？</p>
<p>【一】每個人員要麥成守軍事秘密的習慣，不許隨便談論有關軍事秘密的問題。</p>
<p>【二】秘密文件要妥為保管，並　量少發帶秘密性質的文件。</p>
<p>【三】部隊番號官長姓名，須均用代字，對羣衆不得說出部隊番號及首長姓名，打電話完全用代字。（未完）</p>

<h3>粵省的捷報</h3>
<p>這幾天粵省戰事，迭報勝利，主要的是：（一）反攻江會大勝。我軍再度克復新會城，　卽進　江門，形勢極爲順利。（二）奧北我軍連日分路反攻，節節勝利，太平場戰事激烈，增城×又潰退。（三）我空軍連日在各　助戰揚威續炸三灶黄埔，獲得極大戰果。由於連日我軍之積極在西綫北線反攻，東北方面形勢亦頓趨好轉，潮　方面的戰事得以迅速進入　着狀態。</p>
<p>從粵戰捷報，證明了我們抗戰軍事，已有極大的進步。其戰略指揮的統一和戰術逐行之果敢，機巧，與澈底，尤可為國人告慰。</p>
<p>不過，我們同時要認消，目前×人，正以軍事侵略與政治進攻配台，而我們抗日戰果的保持與擴張尤有賴於我們自己政治的進步。凡足以實際上消　自己力量的一切言論行動，務求其澈底肅清，而所以提高我民氣發揮我民力使能配合抗戰需要的言論行動，則務求其　以保進促其發揚！</p>

<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>李白</p>
<p>醉仙李太白，雖然爲官不見得意，未曾發過大財；可是，酒却不能不喝。而且，不但自己每日一醉；只要客人談得投機，也總是舉觴共飲，盡歡而散。</p>
<p>李學士平生一個怪脾氣，最看不起孟老夫子，只要誰與他同感，立刻引爲知已。</p>
<p>一次，一位書生來訪李學士，晤談之下，異常融洽，尤其抨擊起孟子來，兩人更許爲知音，一共住了十天，天天罵孟子，把李府上存的幾十幾年陳紹，都喝光了，那位書生才興盡而去。</p>
<p>過後，李學士想　，倒也有點心痛，只好忍痛再去買上幾甕。安知不久，那位書生，又聞酒而來。李學士倒急了起來，趕緊迎到大門口，實行擋駕：</p>
<p>『我事後想想，孟子雖然不好，文章倒也還算通。』</p>
<h3>珍聞</h3>
<p>最怪的名字</p>
<p>美國有一個最奇怪的名字，叫做威利，八分之五。這位先生是喬治亞州克字林治郡一間學校的校長。人家問到他名字的來源時，他便很悲哀地說，他父親故意選八分之五。這個數學分數給他，因爲他老人家想替他找一個沒人有的，最特別的名字。</p>
<h3>雨花</h3>
<p>敎師：有什麼最快的方法，可以得到一百元？</p>
<p>學生：打電報給家鄉的父親。</p>
<p>和尙：今生殺牛，轉世就變牛，今生殺猪，轉世就變猪，所以應該戒殺</p>
<p>聽者：那末，不如今世殺人，轉世仍舊可以爲人了。</p>
<p>藝術家：這幅畫題名牛吃草。</p>
<p>訪者：草呢？</p>
<p>藝術家：草被牛吃完了。</p>
<p>訪者：但是，牛在那兒呢？</p>
<p>藝術家：你想他是一頭菜嗎？他吃完了草當然就跑開了。</p>
<p>顧客：座價如何？</p>
<p>賣票員：前座一先令，後座六便士，節目單一便士。</p>
<p>顧客：我就坐在節目單上吧。</p>
<p>『他說，他的手有點抖，要人去握住呢！』</p>
<h3>氣象臺</h3>
<p>天津事，在天津時，日方要求根絕一切遠東問題，英方要求地方解决。現在，在東京了。英大使說：「東京會談，雖以天津問題爲原則，但與天津問題有關之遠東根本問題，亦將討論」。　　　　。</p>
<p>但澤依然很緊，希特勒肚子里，不知在什麼　　　。不過，我們相信，他已經看見了英王的閱軍，聽見了張伯倫的演說，還有英法艦隊將在地中海演習，老希大約耳有所聞了，「戰爭恫嚇」恐怕又撞上了墳墓啦！</p>
<p>「七七」來了。一切的籌備，茹素，義　，停止娛樂，賣花：都挺令人興奮。自上海來的人，說句不客氣的話，對香港有感到相當的失望，上海是那樣的孤島鬼城，但抗戰建國的情緒，眞令人流淚。現在，到香港來了幾個月，才見到「七七」的來臨，香港似　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。但願，從今以後，這件「外衣」，永遠穿下去，不脫下來。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>閻王：你這人，在陽間教書，專念白字，來世罰你不得為人，燮一隻狗。</p>
<p>白字鬼：變狗也不壞，可是，我一定要變母狗。</p>
<p>閻王：這倒奇怪，同是變狗，公狗和母狗，有甚麼分別呢？</p>
<p>白字鬼：啊呀！這太簡單了。閻王老爺想也念過書的，不見古書上有「臨財母狗（毋茍）得，臨難母狗（毋茍）免」嗎，做母狗這樣佔便宜，我當然情願變母狗了。</p>
<h3>麟西瓜　美國的公事</h3>
<p>在華盛頓的白宮里，有一次，一個青年職員在辦公樓邊時——我們不說『在工作時』因為在那裏通常是沒有甚麼工作可做的，——突然什痛甚，同室的職員，趕快叫下級職員去拿點『蘇打』來。蘇打還沒有送到時，那青年已經被抬進醫院去了。要『蘇打』的命令已經發出去，沒有人　收回它，不久大家也就把這件事，忘得一乾二淨了。不料這個要「蘇打」的命令却在靜悄悄　實行起來；關於這件公事的文件由一個辦公檯送到另一個辦公檯，一司過一司，一局過一局，一級過一級，沿途『等因奉此』下去，獲得各種必要　簽字和印鑑。三星期後，負責人員把値美金一角的『蘇打』送到那位靑年服務的辦公室去。沒有人知道送這點藥要做甚麼用。後來經過一番査考，才把這蘆葫打破，於是他們開始調査這位靑年的去處，結果費了五天的工夫才査出來。那靑年已　死了。</p>
<h3>海上風雲23</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述一九一四</p>
<p>年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員經爾，趁德輪「凱柏隆齊號』去遊歷歐洲。因爲英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便狂逃起來。好容易地逃出虎口，囘到美境白海，傑克與比爾便囘紐約去，見到邱克斯先生。邱又叫他們趁「聖瑪克號」去歐洲找他的兒子。在艦上，傑克不肯替一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報……</p>
<p>那兩個人走開了，聲音寂靜，現在，傑克已經完全淸　，躍起身來，分明，在無線電空氣中有點什麼陰謀，但是，他一時却無從猜測，怎樣去應付。</p>
<p>「無論如何，我先讓馬倫知道怎樣應付，」傑克想，「他是一個方正，不茍的人，他不會跟着一塊要猴兒戲的。至於怎樣處置拉維基敎授，倒是另外一件事。我想，還是不必聲張，若是「勃維克號」知道了，他們反在被德國人監察着，他們怎麼不會像大水蜂般發起狂來！」</p>
<p>十一　看住他了</p>
<p>傑克向馬倫，幷不就將强生先生的面幕褐開，因爲，他未和比爾商酌之前，不願意將事情先說出來。</p>
<p>「我不會上那傢伙的當的。」馬倫很忠實的說，他的語氣，使傑克很能放心。</p>
<p>然後，他到艙裏找着比爾，比爾正在寫信。</p>
<p>「喂，比爾，我拆穿那强生先生的神秘了。」</p>
<p>比爾立刻忘了寫信，『你說的是那個會發脾氣的胡椒瓶嗎？』</p>
<p>『就是那像伙，你的老朋友。你沒有弄錯，你說你記得出他的聲音。』</p>
<p>『那個惡魔，他是誰？』</p>
<p>『怎麼，誰還比得上我們那位德國敎授，拉維基！』</p>
<p>『好傢伙！』比爾出乎意外的喊起來，『老煨鷄又來啦？』</p>
<p>『可不是，幷且，對於我，甚無好評呢，比爾！』傑克說，『我想，若是，他能對我玩點什麼手段，他絕不會錯過。』</p>
<p>『他要識時務點，還是別試。』比爾惡很很的舞着拳頭。</p>
<p>「討厭的是，我沒有全知道他玩的倒底是些什麼把戲。」</p>
<p>「這眞太不行，慚愧我們早沒有發覺他，否則，英國巡洋艦會向我們道謝呢。」</p>
<p>「那當然會的，魯蒙加羅吿訴過我，拉維基算上一個狡猾，而又危險的人物。他新製了一種炸藥，幷且。在德國軍事上非常的活動』。</p>
<p>「說起來，加　到那兒去哪？」比爾問。</p>

<h3>華南大衆文藝的問題</h3>
<p>— 羅英</p>
<p>「文章下鄉」的不能迅速地展開，原因是有些文章的本身過於狹　化。它們只適宜於少數知識份子的欣賞，而不能大衆所了解，更談不到使大衆接受。在都市中，它們的讀者已佔少數；在鄉村裏，更少而又少，爲着完成「文章下鄉」這一個任務，大衆文藝的提倡便成爲現階段的重要工作。</p>
<p>大衆文藝，不單是要發展到都市的大衆裏面，而且要深入到廣泛的農村大衆中。當它能够普遍地下鄉的時候，便是大衆文藝能够確立的一天。這樣看來，大衆文藝下鄉，更成爲文化人的當前急　。</p>
<p>大衆文藝怎樣下鄉？</p>
<p>一般文藝作品跟讀者見面的方式，是經由單行本和雜認發表出來。這些讀物的能否深入農村裏面，已屬疑問；就算少數的已經擺在農村大衆面前，而這些對他們生疏的書本子的能否引起他們一讀的興趣，又　疑問；那就不必幻想到他們的肯於化一角幾　來買一本他們不了解的東西了。假如大衆文藝的作品　仍然用這樣的方式來下鄉，能收到的效果，仍然不會比一般文藝的效果大一點。至少，在形式和價錢上它們是不能跟大衆接近的。</p>
<p>一般地方的大衆文藝作品。像「粵曲」，「龍舟」，「章囘小說」等能够流行和深入到廣大的讀者群裏，它們的形式和價錢，都與大衆接近，是原因之。化一個銅板，便可買一兩本愛好的文藝作品，化一角幾分更可買來整套「傑作」，這些才是他們樂於購買和愛讀的東西。</p>
<p>新的文藝作品，當然要採用這個方式來推行下鄉，是無可置疑的。此外還須運用一切可能接近的大衆方式，像小型報，報紙副刊，單張期刊，油印刊物，壁報等；或廉價出售，或義務派送，總求多方面的與他們接觸。等他們習慣了這些讀物的外形和內容時，自然由接近而需要。那時大衆文藝下鄉的目的，已經達到了，大衆文藝的任務，亦已完成了。</p>
<p>大衆詩歌的朗誦，和民間歌謠的演唱，尤其是對一般不識　的農村大衆的重要工作。它的能夠深深地刻在大衆的頭腦中，比起單是敎他們讀讀作品，更爲有效。</p>
<p>這一項工作的展開，在平時沒有動員大量的宣傳工作人員，殊感棘手。在抗戰期間，工作人員遍佈在廣大的農村裏，從他們推動起來，更有不可思議的神連。更能收到不可思議的效果。</p>
<p>有了適當的時機，有了廣大的工作埸所，和有了無限數的人力，而不去盡　地運用，使大衆文藝不能確立，使大衆文藝不能下鄉，因而抗戰與文化不能互相配合，文化人應該負其責任。</p>
<p>在過去抗戰兩年間，一切文化部門都用了全部力量來推動全面抗戰，來完成肅淸漢奸的任務，一時未能集中全力，發動大衆文藝運動，展開大衆下鄉工作。現在，當動員所有文化工作者，無論是作者和工作人員，一致負起這個責任，運用一切有效的宣方式，迅速地把工作展開，才可以眞正完成全民抗戰的任務。</p>
<p>在許多淪陷喊裏，×人利用着倉皇急迫的時間，利用着一切可能接近大衆的方式，對我們的同胞，作反宣傳的工作，有時竟能收到相當效果，假如我們至今仍不出其全力以教育人衆，爭取大衆，豈不是我們的宣傳工作還趕不上×人嗎？</p>
<p>從各方面　報吿看來，華北一帶的戰區，有些地方對大衆文藝下鄉的工作幹得很好，可是，在華南方面，仍須加倍力，急起直追，才可以補救從前尙未做够的工作。</p>
<h3>寄懷鄉病者</h3>
<p>— 丁</p>
<p>我緬想着有這麼一天。</p>
<p>離開了家多年的游子，把一段悠長的歲月，消磨與艱苦，蓬斷的霜晨，黄塵的阡陌，曉月殘星。荒墟野店，在馬上，在渡頭，在夢中，團圓的燈火，家人圍坐在爐邊，或是在豆　瓜架，完結了那一天的工作，那池塘那村邊的古樹，小鎭的伽藍，　夫愚婦的瑣聞軼事，家傳的灰老古屋，屋中一家可愛的氛圍，你都會記掛着。當年的鄉思把一個人磨成抑鬱時，當你第一步提起路上囘家征途時，當你拋撇開鄉土，堅决了不撓的信心，祈死奮鬥着，你事業成功之後，你囘到熟知的環境中去也許你感傷，你流淚，但你不能自己的還是幸福的重逢。</p>
<p>你還記得，你遠征時，你把勇敢的手壓住鄉愁，掩憲了忸怩的兒女態，投向祖國的懷抱中，走上陌生的征途，在黄沙的高原上，在萬山的重疊中，在四季多陰的平　，在滄江峽石間，佈滿了流亡的一羣。從遠方來，每人有一段遠方的囘憶。那失去的遠方，使人惆悵囘戀。隔絕了遠方，再捕捉那遠方。捕捉那烟，那夢，那舊國，那靑山。</p>
<p>你忍苦，爲了捕捉，讓未來的歡笑換來艱苦的流離，讓鄉愁換來光榮的報捷。你忍耐；遙念，捕捉那遠方，從絕緣中構成幻想。每人都有他們的遠方，胡馬依北風。越鳥朝南枝，江南人愛芳草，塞北人愛牛羊，看窮巷的晚炊，有人想起蚊雷時的板屋，高山大澤的猿啼，有人想起茅榭池塘間的蛙鼓。</p>
<p>不僅是你自己的。你的遠方，你思念塞北，你思念江南，你該知道，還有千千萬萬人的家山，朋友的家，祖先的家，歷代祖宗的陵墓，土地芬芳的氣息。離別自然是哀歌，但重逢却更幸福。</p>
<p>像夢，像童話，像更生，你把一段鄉愁砂的土搏草一粒，你縮地如　長房從流居再歸成你的土著，聽到許多無辜者遭難的故事，完好的房屋變　灰燼，屠戮，助逼，愚味，詐欺，造成人間未有的悲劇，也許不幸者就是你要好的親朋，也許房屋的燒燬就有你的一份，像不能不悼惜，你命運的空白，離別中的滄桑。但你畢竟是幸福了。隔絕了透方，又捕捉來那遠方。離別可悲，但重逢却更可喜。</p>
<p>你的家在那兒？你塞北。你江南。爲了你有更大的事業，你間關地走遠了，在馬上，在渡頭，在夢中，你遙寄一段鄉愁，與大江，與歸雁，與白雲與明月。</p>
<p>捕捉那遠方吧，舊國靑山將爲你含笑。你江南的芳成，你塞北的牛羊。</p>
<p>「文明」所經過的地方——Raemakres作</p>
<h3>上海閘北的巡禮（續）</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>現在，只有附近兩路大慶裏的日本的水兵，偶爾發出呼喝聲，和公共租界裏電車的鈴聲，衝破了死一般的沉寂。一九三五到三六造成的兩路大廈本身，還　巍然屹立着，二樓和三樓，已配上意櫺，改成日水兵的兵營，這所造築物也有高柵環繞，哨兵守着大門，除此以外。日方對遭幛房屋聽其自然。灰牆上還有四邊集黑的窟洞，被日軍降海空軍密集轟擊了三個月，受震而鬆動的磚塊，還沒除去，有幾處還可看見殘垣中的鋼筋。</p>
<p>兩路大廈周園的木質建築物，在日機轟炸時，首當其衝，剩下的木材，正有受日方監督的華籍苦力一羣，在柝除着。我在閘北全區，只見到三羣苦力，內有一羣正在拆除一所半毀的教堂，把磚塊整齊地堆積起來，也許是用來建築日方所要造的房屋。除了這批苦力，和一輛公共汽車　的華人，在寶山路寶興街口向日哨兵搖動着通行證之外，我在閘北三小時，所見到的華人不滿二十個。</p>
<p>然而閘北的華人居民雖已減少，並沒絕跡，每一條要道上，尤其是在寶興路上，每隔五十碼站　着一個巡防的哨兵，從樹後，屋角和障碍物裏，悄悄地窺視着經過的每個人和車輛。橋上，有一小隊巡暹水兵，仔細査看幾個過橋的農民的通行證。被佔已十九個月的閘北，爲何還這般嚴密戒備得像一座武裝營。因爲閘北是進租界　日本軍事根據地的前門麼？或是爲了恐怕海外週知的游擊隊襲擊麼？這是不難明瞭的。</p>
<p>假使日本有開始經濟復興的資金和機會，那末，上海『小東京』的閘北，當然是這種計劃的理想地，距離閘北一嗶以內，便有港口，日本能在那裏源源運進建設材料；在上海本身，有着盈千　萬的勞工，找尋工作，還有許多人，渴望囘到他們生長的故鄉。在「小東京」，有着無限制的管理能力，和技術智識的供給，再，日本在整個上海區裏，集中着大批陸海軍士兵，飛機和軍艦，大足保護閘北，不被華軍襲擊。</p>
<p>那末，日本還不開始它盡力宣傳的計劃又將怎樣解釋呢？這答覆對於日本在華的整個經濟和政治活動，便是日本現在發覺，征服和綏靖中國的「神聖使命」，已不是它的能力所可及了。</p>
<p>將近兩年前，日本開始目前的戰爭時，它本來的計劃是藉炫耀它的軍力而加强它在華北的勢力，但死命奮鬥的中國已接應了日本的挑戰，於是戰事便蔓延到上海「事變」便　成了大戰，這真是日本的不拳。戰事旣已擴大，日本所需的經費有增無減。到今天，它的總數大約已等於日本全國的全部歲收；同時，所能得到的資金，都被重工業吸收，兩年前，可供華北經濟開發的資金現已用盡，空無所有，因此，不得不少發像東京暗示已擬定華北經濟計劃等等驚人消息了。</p>
<p>還有比此更重要的，那是不得到居住在所謂「佔領區」的一萬萬以上華人的合作，無論那種復興都是不可能的。不幸的日本，它的軍艦至今沒有博得廣大羣衆的好感，日軍繼續進行可怕的戰事，使中國對侵佔者的痛恨，日增新的力量，這可用游擊戰的日見廣泛和日軍調出的有增無已。至今還高呼着「綏靖佔領區」種種事實來證明的。唉！蕞爾殘破的閘北，已足使日本覺悟從事侵略，等於徒勞，而且是未來悲慘後果的惡兆哩！</p>

<h3>病中吟</h3>
<p>— 郭尼迪</p>
<p>牀頭底劍嘯了；</p>
<p>愛者！</p>
<p>解下給我吧！</p>
<p>劍呀。</p>
<p>昔日你曾塗着</p>
<p>輝煌的史頁</p>
<p>經年來却</p>
<p>讓斑駁的鐵銹開花</p>
<p>而閱然無聞！</p>
<p>歷過多少次愁風愁雨</p>
<p>如今，你終不安於</p>
<p>過往的凄凉</p>
<p>脫頴而嘯了！</p>
<p>（而我正不安於</p>
<p>侷促的牀褥！</p>
<p>你射着霍霍的寒光，</p>
<p>我將因你霍然而起！</p>
<p>我常自擬於</p>
<p>中世紀阿刺伯人</p>
<p>謨罕默德底弟子：</p>
<p>一手執經，</p>
<p>一手執的是你！</p>
<p>你已是不可少的伴侶，</p>
<p>我要佩着你，</p>
<p>駛向遠方去！</p>
<p>今夜，祖宗底血液</p>
<p>在我週身猛烈沸騰！</p>
<p>高叫着仇者底文字，</p>
<p>哭笑隨之以俱來！</p>
<p>愛者呵，</p>
<p>解下給我吧：</p>
<p>床頭　　嘯了！</p>
<h3>擈向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>『眞難怪她那樣怕，我想總該有原因的。』</p>
<p>這時候，一聲尖銳的汽笛，隨着就看到方纔退回去的那到車又開過來。</p>
<p>『這就好了，警報已經解除。』</p>
<p>人們又迅速地向囘跑，怕的失去自己原來的座位。</p>
<p>靜　懶洋洋地立起來，提着那籃水菓，嘴裏還不斷地咕嚕着：</p>
<p>「其實，這警報根本就不必發，又沒有飛機來」。</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道沒有飛機來？眞是要等飛機到頭頂再停，那怕我們連跑也跑不開了」。</p>
<p>『哼，我就不相信會炸死我。』</p>
<p>靑芷不顧意再和她說什麼，攀到車上，靜靜地坐下。她覺得　聞有一點變了，正像從前聽慣一些人說過的女孩子的毛病不沉刻，不深優，又缺乏忍耐，而且還時時抱怨別人。</p>
<p>車繼續地行駛着，平和的田野迅速地被遺留在後面，當着車又停下來，那已經到達中途的一個站。從車意望得見坍場殘破的建築，屋頂沒有了，樑柱也燒焦；可是鐵路上的員工仍都很興奮地工作着。</p>
<p>『是的，這纔是我們應有的精神。』　（未完）</p>

<h3>New Laws to Enhance Wartime Financial Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance announced two new laws the day before yesterday. One is the "Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times," and the other is the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Price Difference for Export Goods." These are wartime laws that adapt to our country's current urgent need to strengthen the power of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>When the Chinese currency depreciated last month, this newspaper repeatedly suggested that our country should strike at the Japanese economically, not only by implementing thorough foreign exchange controls, but also by further implementing trade controls. Only in this way can we effectively consolidate and enhance the strength of wartime finance for resistance and achieve the final victory over Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>The first decree announced by the Ministry of Finance aims to maintain the balance of international payments. Because our country has always been a country with a trade deficit, and during the Anti-Japanese War, the national defense equipment needed, such as military, transportation, and industrial products, relied more on foreign countries; however, since the Anti-Japanese War, all imported goods have failed to implement controls, let alone meet the needs of the war of resistance and national reconstruction. The unnecessary consumption of foreign exchange, directly and indirectly, has damaged our resistance and national reconstruction undertakings; in addition, recently, Japanese invaders and traitors have used counterfeit currency to obtain a large amount of our foreign exchange, and many people who have lost their conscience and disregard the interests of the country and the nation have tried their best to transfer funds secretly. The impact on foreign exchange has further affected our country's wartime finances. The Ministry of Finance's method of prohibiting the import of goods can simultaneously combat the conspiracy of Japanese invaders and traitors and save the increasingly serious crisis.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the overall national and ethnic interests, this decree is something that every one of our citizens should sincerely support. Because we prohibit some non-urgent and luxurious goods during the war, the country can obtain more foreign exchange, so as to purchase essential goods for resistance and national reconstruction, so as to defeat the Japanese invaders and strive for the final victory, and protect national liberation and happiness; at the same time, in terms of society and our own people, we can also eliminate extravagance and dissoluteness, transform social customs, and build a foundation for future national construction. As for the international aspect, although friendly countries’ export merchants to China will suffer considerable impact for a while, this move by our government is completely aimed at the current situation in the Far East to protect the stability and order. It can also be said that it is to protect the common interests of our country and friendly countries. Friends from friendly countries should sympathize with it. What's more, the increase in the import of national defense items may ultimately be more beneficial to democratic and peaceful friendly countries!</p>
<p>The second decree of the Ministry of Finance is entirely to solve the difficulties of merchants and promote export trade, increase wartime production through increased exports, and make the national economy more consolidated. Therefore, this decree is not only necessary for overcoming difficulties, supporting the war of resistance, and combating the Japanese invaders, but also can lay a foundation for building an ideal country in the future. We hope that this decree, which is practically sufficient to protect industrialists and businessmen and improve wartime production and construction, can be effectively implemented, and that publicity and interpretation work can be intensified, not only to carry out extensive production mobilization work in China, but also to encourage the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and industrialists from friendly countries to invest in the development of our inland production.</p>
<p>What's more, some people think that the two new decrees of the Ministry of Finance have been implemented a little late. In fact, this is entirely due to the special conditions of the entire international situation and the semi-colonial status of our country. However, the result of our country's adherence to unity and resistance for two years has made these subjective and objective special conditions begin to change significantly; therefore, our Ministry of Finance was able to announce these two new decrees in response to suggestions from all parties, and firmly believes that it will be able to achieve the expected results! Here, we foresee the prospect that the Chinese nation will be able to finally defeat the Japanese invaders and strive for independence, freedom, and happiness!</p>
<p>Special Article of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>On Guerrilla Warfare on the Plains</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shiti</p>
<p>[3] When guerrilla corps or regular corps are besieged by Japanese in a vast area:</p>
<p>First, use a small number of troops and make as much use of guerrillas as possible to harass and contain the Japanese in all aspects, destroy communications, and circle around the rear and left and right of the Japanese to prevent the Japanese from reaching their destinations at the same time according to the original plan, and use fatigue to create weaknesses and faults in the Japanese, so that our army can concentrate its main force and, under favorable conditions, attack one route of the Japanese before the Japanese divide and fail to converge (the main combat method is night attack or ambush), but do not mechanically understand and apply the principle of 'attacking one route of the Japanese'.</p>
<p>Second, if the situation does not allow concentrating the main force to attack one route of the Japanese, the main force can be dispersed (but not evenly dispersed), and the direction of the main force is still the main force (although the strength of each unit is equal, the density of the allocated areas is different). On the one hand, it can prevent the Japanese from finding our main force and converging (so that the Japanese divide and cannot converge); on the other hand, it can also create difficulties for the Japanese, confuse the Japanese's siege deployment, and sometimes it can also make the Japanese's offensive stop, and sometimes it can also create weaknesses and faults for the Japanese, so that we can find favorable opportunities to attack the Japanese again.</p>
<p>Third, if the Japanese army is very superior and the situation does not allow a large force to stay in the area, then a part of the guerrillas will stay in the area to disperse and harass the Japanese, while the main force will transfer to another area. However, attention should be paid to timely transfer, and it is not advisable to be too early or too late, because on the one hand, there are Japanese around the guerrilla area, and sometimes the Japanese carry out deceptive transfers, and sometimes they make a show of force without any offensive intentions. If they transfer without clarifying the situation, it is useless. On the other hand, the Japanese have already implemented a siege, but our reconnaissance is not thorough, and we cannot know the Japanese's intentions in time, or even arrogant, negligent, and unprepared. When the Japanese's encirclement has been formed, we will transfer in a hurry, which is also wrong. Therefore, it is not advisable to transfer too early or too late. This requires the leading agency to have good reconnaissance and careful and correct judgment of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) When besieged by Japanese in a small area: Larger guerrilla corps or regular corps should not operate in small and difficult-to-maneuver areas except for certain combat missions. (such as in the narrow areas between the Japanese strongholds). The task of guerrillas usually operates in small areas. Guerrillas operating in small areas should not mechanically understand the principle of concentrating the main force to attack one route of the Japanese. Generally, it is a concentrated transfer, using guerrilla actions to attack the Japanese. It is best to use small units (preferably plain clothes) to transfer to the side and rear of the Japanese.</p>
<p>(5) When the Japanese army is besieging, we should have active combat intentions and do everything possible to attack the Japanese army and smash their siege. If it is not possible! Then transfer the troops in time, and use guerrillas to make circular rotations to get rid of the Japanese. When we transfer, there are many places that have been occupied by the Japanese, but the Japanese have limited troops, and it is impossible to divide their troops to occupy the vast area. In places that have been occupied by the Japanese, we should constantly attack the Japanese to make it difficult and panic for the Japanese. As a result, these places can often be restored.</p>
<p>4 Prepare for battle at any time</p>
<p>On the plains, we must be prepared for action and combat at any time. The Japanese army has greater mobility on the plains than in the mountains. Emergencies may occur at any time. Troops operating on the plains must be prepared for action and war at any time. Therefore, we must pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Regardless of the troops or agencies, especially the documents, office supplies, and equipment in the agencies, they should always be packed. When they need to be used, they should be taken out and put in at any time, and should not be put away casually.</p>
<p>(2) Regardless of the combat troops or agencies, they should be lightly armed. Huge rear agencies and troops carrying a lot of heavy luggage, burdens, mules and horses are not allowed.</p>
<p>(3) The housekeeping should meet the requirements of war. Packages and blankets should always be tied up. The general housekeeping method of folding the blankets into squares and placing them in the middle of the bed is not known.</p>
<p>5 Preserve military secrets</p>
<p>Secrecy is one of the basic conditions for ensuring the benefits of war. If our troop strength and intended actions are known to the Japanese in advance, it is often difficult to achieve victory even if we are very brave and determined, and sometimes we may be in danger. Therefore, preserving military secrets is one of the basic conditions for ensuring victory in battle. Our □□ Brigade ambushed the Japanese army near Zhangjiawan on November 11. The Japanese army did not notice it beforehand, so it was able to completely annihilate hundreds of people led by the Japanese Brigade Commander Changgang Kuanzhi. Our □□ Regiment ambushed the Japanese army near Mingbao on November 17 and also completely annihilated and captured 35 trucks of Japanese soldiers and military supplies. Our □□ Brigade waited for several days on the Zuonao area 40 miles south of Wutai. Due to the blockade of news and strict secrecy, the Japanese in Wutai never found out. Therefore, the Queye Brigade dared to attack Hongkou Town on the night of November 2, and then turned back to Wutai on the night of the 3rd, and was completely annihilated by us near Huashipian. For example, on November 29, our Lu Regiment ambushed the Japanese army south of Zhibao, and the Lu Regiment ambushed the Japanese army north of Lingqiu. Because the attempt was exposed, the result was that victory could not be achieved. These are all real examples.</p>
<p>The villages and towns on the plains are dense and there are many roads. It is more difficult to block news than in the mountains. At the same time, the activities of Japanese spies and traitors also require more attention to preserving secrets. How do we strictly keep secrets?</p>
<p>[1] Every person should develop the habit of keeping military secrets and should not casually discuss issues related to military secrets.</p>
<p>[2] Secret documents should be properly kept and the number of documents with secret nature should be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p>[3] The unit number and the name of the officer must be replaced with a code name. The unit number and the name of the chief officer must not be told to the masses. Telephone calls must be made entirely with code names. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Our Army Controls the War Situation in Southern Guangdong Zhang Fakui Talks About the Military Situation in South China Favorable Development in the Gan War Intense Fighting in the Lu War</h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 3rd] The war in southern Shandong is still fierce. About 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese and Communists in the area of Juxian, Yishui, and Rizhao have been fighting a bloody battle with us for three days and nights at Dongshi, east of Juxian, killing 400 to 500 Japanese and Communists. The Japanese army, defeated by us in Zheshui Dongxueshan, actually massacred more than 1,000 civilians before retreating.</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Guilin, This Newspaper, 3rd] The Japanese invaders who attacked Shantou and Chaozhou were also transferred from Guangzhou. Our army has been very active in Conghua, Guangzhou recently. Zengcheng and Conghua are all under our control. The Japanese army in Taipingchang has shown signs of retreat. There are still fierce battles near Jiangmen and Xinhui. The Japanese army is stubbornly resisting at Ma'anshan in Huicheng. We are attacking fiercely.</p>
<p>(Special Telegram from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 3rd) Our troops in northern Jiangxi are constantly in contact with the Japanese army. All strongholds southwest of Chongling have been occupied by us. Yesterday, we killed the Japanese captain Miyazaki Mine and many soldiers.</p>
<p>[Special News from Shaoguan, Nanfeng News Agency] At dawn today (3rd), the Command of the ×th War Zone convened senior party, government, and military officials to hold an expanded memorial week in July. More than 1,000 people attended. Acting Commander Zhang Fakui led the ceremony and reported. Zhang said that the purpose of the Japanese invasion of Boshan this time was to strike at our economy and cut off our supplies. At the same time, they wanted to control Xianggang and threaten Britain. Its effect is the same as occupying Guangzhou, but Guangzhou's position is more important. Militarily, we have no navy and no fortresses. Chaozhou and Shantou are not easy to defend, but no matter how much land is lost, we must get the greatest price from the Japanese. Therefore, our army fought heroically in Chaozhou and Shantou this time, and must inflict heavy blows on the Japanese. Secondly, since our army retreated from Guangzhou, it has launched three attacks, each of which has achieved small victories and captured many Japanese soldiers. Although Guangzhou has not been recovered yet, it has proved that our army is getting stronger and stronger as it fights. Finally, he encouraged public officials to sacrifice themselves, work hard in public service, strictly keep secrets, and act quickly and effectively, and to cheer up to shoulder the important task of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<p>Our Army Attacks Japanese Airfields in Guangdong The Air Force Sends Bombs to Bomb Japanese Positions</p>
<p>[News from Wengyuan, Central News Agency, 2nd] On the night of the 29th, our plainclothes team in Guangzhou attacked the Tianhe Airport in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou in two routes, and fought fiercely with the Japanese army, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. They then withdrew.</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Macau, This Newspaper, 3rd] 48 of our planes attacked the Japanese positions in Jiangmen and Guangzhou, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. Bai Ling Airport was also bombed. Many Japanese planes were unable to take off and were destroyed. The sound of explosions was very loud. Japanese and puppet organization officials in Guangzhou were panicked.</p>
<p>[Special News from Shaoguan, Nanfeng News Agency] Intelligence on the 2nd (1) The Japanese and I are still fighting for Chaoan City. The Japanese army is densely packed in Fengxi. We are confronting the Japanese army in Yixi City on the Han River. Many Japanese boats are parked on the Xiangzi Bridge and are forcing our people to build the Chaozhou-Shantou railway. (11) After our army recovered Xinhui, it continued to advance rapidly. Our commando team has arrived in Jiangmen and killed hundreds of Japanese soldiers near Zhongshan Park and Yindun Mountain. Their bodies are lying on the road. Our army is now attacking.</p>
<p>[News from Wengyuan, Central News Agency, 2nd] According to refugees who escaped from Shengang, Conghua, when our army entered Gangxu on the 28th, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Six shells hit the Japanese army dormitory in the Li Family Ancestral Hall in the base, killing more than 40 Japanese officers.

<p>[News from Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] Tianjin News: It is reported that after Wang Jingwei arrived in Beijing, he hoped to meet with Wu Peifu immediately, but the Japanese side had different opinions. Some advocated that Wang visit Wu, while others advocated that Wu visit Wang, and even more advocated choosing a suitable place to meet. Wu suddenly insisted on not meeting with Wang, so cooperation between Wang and Wu has become difficult to achieve. It is generally believed that although the reports on the new pseudo-organization are inconsistent, Wang Jingwei has decided to surrender to the Japanese and may as well use him to try it out. The focus of this matter has now shifted from Beijing to Shanghai.</p>

He has a wife, a son, a daughter, and two parents to support, all of whom depend on him to make a living.

The Japanese can take this opportunity to incite Muslims in various places to launch a unified anti-British movement. Although the Japanese conspiracy to use the people has become more intense and increasingly vicious, the 50 million Muslims in our country have seen through their conspiracy. The Islamic countries of the world have their own correct judgments and will never be deceived by their deceptive methods.</p>

<h3>President Kong Issues Declaration: Elucidating the Significant Measures of the Ministry of Finance, Announcing to the Nation the Importance of Conserving Consumption to Build the Nation and Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd) President Kong made an official statement regarding the Ministry of Finance's announcement of rules for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods, saying: Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the Ministry has repeatedly stipulated and actively implemented measures to consolidate financial stability and the foreign exchange market. On the one hand, it has stipulated measures for the sale of foreign exchange from exported goods to replenish the foreign exchange fund, and on the other hand, it continues to provide necessary foreign exchange for the import of essential goods. This spring, a Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee was jointly established by China and the United Kingdom to manage the stabilization of the foreign exchange market, which has greatly benefited merchants and the people. Now, in this extraordinary period, all citizens should practice frugality and reduce consumption of all luxury goods and non-essential goods for the purpose of national construction. As for domestic products, efforts should be made to export them to maintain the balance of international payments and benefit the national economy. However, recently, transportation has been difficult, the cost of exported goods has increased, and at the same time, unscrupulous merchants have devised all sorts of tricks to obtain foreign exchange, causing improper fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Although the stabilization fund has sufficient strength, it is threatened by these improper activities. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully plan measures under the principle of "preventing speculation, considering legitimate needs, and benefiting the national economy." Special orders have been issued to prohibit the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods. For exported goods, except for tung oil, tea, pig bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter and debt repayment and will be purchased by trade organizations at preferential prices, it is only necessary to sell the foreign exchange obtained at the legal rate to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications, and then receive the legal rate from the settling bank with the foreign exchange settlement certificate. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will jointly recover the price difference to encourage their active operation and seek the development of production, thereby promoting the equilibrium of imports and exports. At the same time, to ensure legitimate commercial needs, foreign exchange required for the purchase of essential domestic imports may be applied for to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee. After approval, the designated bank will sell it at the legal rate. Since exported goods have already benefited from the difference between the selling exchange rate, imported goods should collect a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal rate and the bank's listed market rate to ensure uniformity and fairness. This approach will not only help stabilize the foreign exchange market but also meet domestic needs, and strictly prevent speculation. It is a temporary and necessary measure to cope with the environment in this extraordinary period. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee was established with the enthusiasm of friendly nations. Since its implementation, it has proven to be a good institution for Sino-foreign cooperation, which has greatly benefited the stabilization of the foreign exchange market. After the implementation of these examination rules, the work of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee will proceed as usual to ensure that its effectiveness can be fully realized. This is also announced to Chinese and foreign personnel.</p>
<h3>Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods Officially Announced by the Ministry of Finance</h3>

<h3>American Economic Expert's Speech: Japan Will Inevitably Be Defeated; Raw Materials and Workers Are Both Lacking; China's Status Will Increase From Now On</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Garnotville, USA, 2nd] American economic expert J. Lossi, recently gave a speech at the University of Virginia, stating that, judging from the current situation, China can defeat Japan, and Britain, America, the Philippines, etc., will cooperate to build a progressive East Asia. Japan's aggression against China has greatly enhanced China's position. However, even if China wins, because China has borrowed money from Europe, it will still be subject to the conditions put forward by various European countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] Commerce Secretary Hopkins reported today that Japan is currently feeling a raw materials panic, and at the same time, there is a lack of skilled workers. Therefore, in order to meet the military needs of the war against China and develop national industry, Japan has an unprecedented need for foreign industrial machinery. Japanese military personnel are eager for self-sufficiency, but Japanese manufacturers are unable to supply machinery, automobiles, and raw silk made to order from various parties. Some factories, etc., require two years to deliver goods made to order from various parties.</p>

<h3>After Strong Stance From Britain and France, Germany Faces Dilemma; Hitler Shows Signs of Softening, But Danzig Nazis Still Plotting</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 2nd) Over the weekend, all of Europe's attention was focused on Hitler. However, according to The Observer of London, Hitler generally intends to postpone any further action against Danzig until the end of this month or early August. This may be because the British side has issued a warning, stating that if Germany forcibly occupies Danzig, it will be tantamount to declaring war. Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech tonight, following Foreign Secretary Halifax, issuing a warning to Germany. Although some believe that Hitler has not fully understood Britain's determination, he is still trying to create some kind of fait accompli.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 2nd] British Chargé d'Affaires to Poland, Mr. Norton, again visited the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, meeting with Colonel Beck's private secretary. It is understood that the latest developments in the national situation were discussed. Rumors are rife that Poland has a strongly worded diplomatic note demanding that the Danzig Senate explain the various military actions recently taken in Danzig. According to newspaper reports, another batch of military transport ships arrived at the Hisingen Wharf in Danzig last night, reportedly loaded with light tanks and cannons. These weapons are being unloaded and transferred to the artillery positions in Bischofsberg and Hagelsberg. Access to these two artillery positions is currently prohibited. Polish Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, reported to Foreign Minister Beck and will soon return to Danzig. The Polish government gazette carried news from London and Paris, informing the people that if Germany attempts to riot, Britain and France will intervene. The newspaper's London correspondent also highlighted the report that the British people support this move to show its importance. The conservative newspaper "Glos" carried a London news item, stating that the British government has received intelligence that Germany intends to cause a riot in Danzig now or in the near future. The newspaper commented, "It is not yet known whether this matter is already in the planning stage. If Germany's recent actions are merely a political performance, then Poland should be gratified because it has brought the chaotic situation to a point of clarification and Germany's vision has been extended." The newspaper pointed out Poland's calmness, but "If Germany wants to go to war with us, we will not retreat." The independent party's newspaper also published news from London and Paris about the situation, including an unconfirmed rumor that British and French teams will visit Kinia. All Polish newspapers have published the British Labour Congress's declaration to Germany and praised it. Landlords everywhere have received orders to build air-raid shelters, with a deadline of two months to complete them.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Officials here know nothing of the rumors in Warsaw that British and French teams will visit Kinia.</p>
<p>Danzig Situation: Outwardly Relaxed, Inwardly Tense; Nazi Leader Gives Speech, Vehemently Demanding Danzig's Return to Germany</p>
<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 2nd] The leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, also gave a speech at the party congress today, which was greatly applauded by the audience. His speech was directed at Britain and its allies, stating: "Our position is extremely firm. We want to return to Germany, and this will soon be realized. The power of the German leader's words is a million times more powerful for us than the clamor of the whole world. We in Danzig do not need to worry ourselves, because any steps taken by Poland cannot frighten us. If the German leader gives Danzig freedom, then the Germans here will unite as one, be loyal to the state and its leader, and be prepared to sacrifice everything the leader demands, which includes not only property but also flesh and blood. Countries adopting an encirclement policy are now preparing to engage in war, which is contrary to the self-determination they advocate, making the truth of the world forever buried. They are even prepared to give Danzig to Poland, rather than satisfy the demands of the residents of Danzig to return Danzig to Germany."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 2nd] Today, the German Commissioner to Danzig, Herr Forster, spoke at a memorial service for the establishment of the local party, saying that the people of Danzig are very willing to return to Germany, and it will be as expected in the future. The audience applauded greatly, interrupting the speech. This morning, the streets of Danzig were no different from a normal Sunday, but there were no people of military age or uniformed personnel coming and going, because they all had another task. The soldiers appearing on the streets belonged to the 36th Regiment of the Second West Prussian Artillery, who had gone from the Hohesingen barracks to pay tribute at the European Memorial Cemetery, and then dispersed. Soldiers wearing German uniforms are often seen in Danzig, but their neat ranks in light blue uniforms are still noteworthy. Currently, Germany and Poland, along the Polish Corridor, are busy harvesting green and yellow grains and hurriedly erecting barbed wire. German and Polish authorities have ordered the avoidance of all accidents to prevent major disputes, and all parties are strictly complying. However, although the surface is calm, the tension behind the scenes is very high. This can be seen from the proliferation of barracks. Citizens going out often see new and old soldiers training, high-altitude artillery is mounted on the Bishop's Hill, fortifications and military camps are being intensified, and munitions are secretly transported at night. Polish sources say that they know everything very well and are waiting for changes, believing that they have the strength to cope. The National Socialist Party denies that this incident has any malicious intent and says that in the near future, Polish representatives will attend the Danzig City Council, which is expected to break the deadlock in the conflict between the National Socialist Party and Poland. Last night, the citizens of Danzig at the Sopot pier looked out at the Polish warships, merchant ships, and fishing boats entering the harbor in a line, their lights shining brightly, celebrating the Polish Holy Communion. General Haller, who organized the Polish army in the French army during the last war, Cardinal Halgon, and twelve other bishops were on the same ship.</p>
<p>Polish Government Takes a Strong Stance; Reportedly Demanding Explanation of Military Measures from the Danzig Senate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] It is rumored that the Polish government has sent a note to the Danzig Free City Senate, demanding an explanation of the various military measures taken in the city. The wording of the note is extremely strong. The situation in Danzig is currently very serious, and the above two matters should be the most important recent developments in Danzig.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd] The Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, returned to the country to report yesterday and was received by General Sumigli-Dzichowski, Chief of the Army, and Foreign Minister Beck, who gave him instructions in person. When Chodacki returns to his post in the coming days, he will enjoy special powers to cope with the situation in Danzig. It is also rumored that Britain, France, and Poland plan to jointly negotiate with the Danzig authorities, either directly or through the national high commissioner stationed in Danzig, to show that their attitudes are completely consistent. Foreign observers believe that this move may not be implemented and will only be Chodacki representing the Polish government, sending a note to the Danzig City Council, informing them that the city's legal status does not allow it to be armed, and asking the city authorities why they have been taking military measures recently, or often issuing warnings, stating that if Poland's rights in the free city are infringed, it will often be regarded as an infringement on Poland's independence. However, the Danzig side may not take violent actions for the time being. The intention of the city authorities seems to be to gradually arm themselves to prevent Poland from occupying it by force. The German government is trying to make outsiders believe that the accidents that occur in Danzig are purely internal affairs.</p>
<p>Berlin Acts Calm; Troops Concentrated on the German-Polish Border; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Shipped to Danzig</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Tonight, everything in Berlin is calm. The newspapers only mention the rumors about the Danzig issue spread by the London and Paris press in a very short space. There is no excitement in any aspect here regarding the Danzig issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd] According to reliable sources, the German government recently notified the Polish government that the German cruiser Königsberg will arrive in the port of Danzig on August 27 or 28 to hold a memorial service for the German cruiser Magdeburg, which sank in the waters of the port during the European War.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 1st] According to German soldiers who fled into Poland, Germany is building fortifications at the border between Poland and Bohemia and concentrating two army divisions in the Friedland area of Bohemia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Small cannons, tanks, and other military supplies are still entering Danzig. According to Polish newspaper reports, wartime preparations are being intensified in Danzig. In addition, several military transport boats continue to arrive to unload small tanks and gun carriages, and then transfer them to the fortifications in Tiefensee and Hagelsberg. Access for the public is now prohibited. The Polish Commissioner to Danzig is scheduled to report everything to Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in the short term.</p>
<p>France Also Expresses Determination to Resist; Bonnet Informs German Ambassador That France is Determined to Fulfill its Guarantee Obligations</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] French President Lebrun stated at a banquet last night that France loves peace but, at the same time, for the sake of self-defense, will not avoid necessary sacrifices. France and its allies are obliged to fulfill their promises.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] The Times commented on the meeting between German Ambassador to France Welczek and Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday to exchange views on the current European situation, saying that France's precise stance is the same as Britain's, and that it has decided to fulfill all the obligations arising from the current agreements. All of this was officially notified to the German government by Foreign Minister Bonnet at the most appropriate time through normal diplomatic channels. This is an important factor in the development of the international situation in the future, and it is in line with the clause in the peace declaration signed by France and Germany on December 6 last year, which states that if the international situation becomes tense, the two governments should immediately exchange views. The French government believes that informing Germany of France's position at this time is of great benefit to peace. What is its position? That is, France cannot agree to any unilateral attempt to modify the legal status of Danzig or destroy it. The guarantees recently provided to Poland by the British and French governments will be fulfilled under any circumstances. Once the German government receives Ambassador Welczek's report, there will be no doubt about this. In short, when Foreign Minister Bonnet spoke to the German ambassador, he was very humble and very firm, and he did not threaten or provoke Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] It is rumored that the British and French governments have issued a warning to Germany, saying that if Germany annexes the city of Danzig, Britain and France will not tolerate it. Officials here recently denied this, saying that the British and French governments have intensified their exchange of views and recalled their ambassadors to Poland to report, which is indeed the case, but they have never made any representations to the German government or issued any warnings. As of now, Germany has not interfered in the Danzig issue on the surface. The current tension is occurring internally in Danzig. Accordingly, if the authorities of the Free City do have the intention of declaring annexation to Germany, then the parties with whom the British and French governments negotiate are also the authorities of the Free City, and not the German government.</p>
<p>Conflicts Continue on the Pseudo-Mongolian Border; Japanese Troops Gather, Intending to Cause Trouble; The Scale of Conflicts Increases Daily</p>
<p>[Reuters, Dalian, 3rd] The Kwantung Army, the long-term garrison of Japan in "Manchukuo," announced that yesterday the Kwantung Army attacked the Soviet-Mongolian forces at Lake Hulunber because the Soviet-Mongolian forces had "already in June" crossed the border from Outer Mongolia. This battle was the largest in scale in the past few weeks, with both sides using tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, airplanes, and cavalry. According to Japanese military reports, the Soviet-Mongolian forces have been driven back to the Khalkhin Gol River, and the Japanese artillery and airplanes are now fiercely bombing the Outer Mongolian positions on the opposite bank of the river. The Soviet Union recently issued a communique stating that the Soviet-Mongolian troops have occupied positions along a "fixed line," which is about twelve miles east of the Khalkhin Gol River, which is the focal point of the dispute between the two sides.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hailar, 3rd] Yesterday, the reporter personally saw three Soviet No. 16 airplanes flying over "Manchukuo" territory for reconnaissance.

The reporter also inspected the site where the air battle recently took place and saw that the situation there was always the same. Yesterday, a small conflict occurred between the sentries of both sides, but it was not important.</p>
<p>[Changchun Foreign News] On the border between the pseudo-Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia, Japanese troops are gathering more and more, intending to cause trouble, and disputes are becoming increasingly serious. According to Japanese sources, on June 24, the Soviet-Mongolian frontline troops, led by dozens of tanks, ambushed General Xing'an with cavalry and infantry. On the 27th, 200 Soviet-Mongolian airplanes engaged in fierce air battles with Japanese airplanes. The Japanese and puppet First Army Division received orders and launched a full-scale offensive from the 29th. There are battles everywhere at any time. It is said that more than 1,000 Soviet-Mongolian infantry and cavalry are resisting. The scale of the conflict is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Turmoil of the European Situation, the British King Inspects Volunteers, Chamberlain Gives Broadcast Speech, Reaffirming Determination to Cope with Aggression</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] In his broadcast speech tonight, British Prime Minister Chamberlain read on behalf of the British King his address on the national defense preparations. The British King first expressed his pleasure at personally witnessing the National Service Volunteers lined up for drill in Hyde Park today, and then said, "What I have seen today is the most profound and moving expression of the spirit of national service. This spirit is now prevalent throughout the country, thereby expressing the determination of the entire people to make the country ready to cope with any emergency situation and to endure any sacrifice. Our national defense forces have been established, the national conscription system has been happily followed by the people, and the volunteer teams have begun to work. I cannot but praise this spirit of public service, and I cannot but be grateful to the wives who send their husbands to serve in the volunteer teams. Your actions are enough to promote the strength and security of the country, and you should be comforted by this. At the same time, I remember all the reserves and local troops who have also been ordered to leave their homes and jobs at this time to strengthen national defense. You know that the purpose of our preparations is not to provoke war, but to maintain peace. We still retain our original desire, that all countries can eventually find a way to coexist peacefully, but at the same time, we are determined to do everything possible to safeguard national security. In this regard, the contribution of the National Volunteers is very great and deserves the gratitude of the whole country." Before the Prime Minister read the King's speech, he first made a few important statements, saying, "We are now at a serious and critical time. We ourselves are peace-loving people and have no intention of conflict with anyone, but when necessary, whether it is a direct aggression against us or an aggression against a country that has obtained our guarantee, we will resolutely respond with all our strength. Today, the people in the rear are also standing on the front line, so every member of the nation has the responsibility to assist in national defense. You have answered what kind of national service you can undertake. Within a few months, we have added 1.25 million volunteers to our national defense forces. The great spirit shown by the people of the whole country in voluntarily participating in national service is beyond praise. Your great spirit further increases the country's confidence in coping with the future."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The King, accompanied by the Queen and Queen Mary, inspected the drill of 20,000 men and women (representing the National Service Volunteers) in Hyde Park this afternoon to see the entire situation of the national service organization, including every aspect of air defense operations. Two hundred mechanized vehicles participated in the march, which lasted for more than an hour. This morning, the King and Queen attended a thanksgiving prayer service after their return from Canada, Newfoundland, and the United States. The service was held at Westminster Abbey, and Sir Stancliffe and Colonel Cowell were appointed by the Cabinet to attend on behalf of them. Before the ceremony, everyone sang the national anthem together. Reverend Birrell read prayers on behalf of the King and the royal family, and then held prayers for peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Officials announced that the authorities have formed a Women's Auxiliary Air Force to train female air force officers and non-commissioned officers to assist the Royal Air Force in serving the country during wartime. In addition, cooks, chauffeurs, etc., will also be trained by the government.</p>
<h3>British Fleet to Conduct Exercises in the Mediterranean; Large Numbers of Ships Heading for Concentration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British Mediterranean Fleet will conduct exercises in the eastern Mediterranean in the near future. Several warships of all sizes, together with the 22,500-ton aircraft carrier Glorious, are scheduled to sail to Greek territorial waters within days to concentrate and participate in the exercises.</p>
<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Debates Neutrality Law: Hull Plan Rejected; Secretary of State Issues Somber Statement; Resolves to Continue Efforts to Seek Adoption</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to newspaper reporters, stating that it was regrettable that the government-sponsored neutrality bill was defeated. He will continue his efforts to ensure that the provisions prohibiting the export of munitions are not included in the new neutrality law. In his letters to the Senate and House of Representatives on May 2nd of this year, he listed six points regarding this plan, believing that they would be sufficient for our country to maintain peace and avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. This would be more effective than a neutrality law containing provisions prohibiting the export of munitions or other similar clauses. Before submitting this plan, he repeatedly discussed it with the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress and members of various parties, and then submitted it to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses for review. Initially, given the international situation, even if this plan was not entirely satisfactory, it was expected to be accepted by a majority of members of Congress. Unexpectedly, it was defeated by a few votes, which is regrettable for the sake of maintaining peace and for the sake of our country's most valuable international relations. This is because his plan is not only a way for our country to maintain peace after the outbreak of war, but its most important point is to help prevent war, which is far better than the current neutrality law or other similar laws, and is fully in line with international law. For these reasons, he will continue to work to ensure that his proposals are adopted by Congress.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Speaker of the House, Bankhead, recently stated that it was unwise for the House to fail to remove the ban on the export of munitions during the debate on the neutrality law. European "troublemakers" may therefore believe that the two major bodies of the U.S. legislative and executive branches do not agree on important national policy steps. He is deeply concerned that this move by the House will have serious consequences abroad within a few days.</p>
<h3>Churchill: British Press Strongly Advocates for Inclusion in Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] The Daily Telegraph has repeatedly published articles demanding that the government invite Churchill to join the cabinet. So far, the British newspapers that have made this request include the Yorkshire Post, the Liberal News, the Shoreham Herald, and the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Telegraph editorial avoids attacking Chamberlain himself, but argues that the current foreign policy of the British cabinet is too weak. In these critical times, experienced and talented individuals should be appointed to the cabinet. The newspaper also said that although there are many political enemies of Churchill within the cabinet and the Conservative Party, if Churchill can join the cabinet, the Axis powers will know that Britain is not easy to deal with.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Misunderstanding Cleared; Seeds Reports British Study; Chamberlain Temporarily Refrains from Making Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British Foreign Office has received a lengthy report from the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, on his meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday. Reuters diplomatic correspondents say that further meetings are expected within days and that all misunderstandings regarding guarantees for small countries have been swept away.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] During today's session of the House of Commons, a member asked Prime Minister Chamberlain about the recent progress of the Anglo-Soviet talks. Chamberlain replied, "On Saturday and Sunday, Anglo-Soviet representatives held talks in the UK. The government is now awaiting a response from the Soviet Union. I feel that under the current state of negotiations, it is not appropriate to make any further statements. If a response is received on Sunday, then I can issue a more substantial and specific statement." After receiving the detailed report from Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union, the British Foreign Office is currently studying it. The report concerns the Anglo-Soviet talks held last Saturday and Sunday. It is generally believed that both sides will soon continue consultations.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Triumphant News from Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>In recent days, triumphant news has been reported from the battlefields of Guangdong Province. The main victories are: (1) A major victory in the counter-offensive against Jiangmen and Xinhui. Our forces have recaptured Xinhui City and are advancing towards Jiangmen, with a very favorable situation. (2) Our forces have launched a multi-pronged counter-offensive in northern Ao, achieving successive victories. The fighting in Taipingchang is fierce, and Zengcheng is collapsing again. (3) Our air force has continued to assist in the battles across various locations, demonstrating its power by bombing Sanzhao and Huangpu, achieving great results. Thanks to our forces' active counter-offensive on the western and northern fronts in recent days, the situation in the northeast has also improved significantly, and the fighting in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas has rapidly entered a state of settlement.</p>
<p>The triumphant news from the Guangdong battles proves that our military resistance has made great progress. The unified strategic command, the courageous and skillful execution of tactics, and thoroughness are especially gratifying to the nation.</p>
<p>However, we must also recognize that the enemy is currently coordinating military aggression with political offensives. Maintaining and expanding our achievements in the war of resistance depends even more on our own political progress. All statements and actions that actually diminish our own strength must be thoroughly eliminated. Meanwhile, statements and actions that enhance our national spirit, unleash our national power, and align with the needs of the war of resistance must be promoted to ensure their growth and development!</p>

<h3>One Person a Day</h3>
<p>Li Bai</p>
<p>The drunken immortal Li Taibai, although not successful in his official career and never becoming wealthy, could not do without wine. Moreover, he not only got drunk every day himself, but also always raised his glass and drank with guests as long as they had a good conversation, enjoying themselves to the fullest before parting.</p>
<p>The scholar Li had a strange habit throughout his life. He looked down on Mencius the most, and would immediately consider anyone who shared this feeling his confidant.</p>
<p>Once, a scholar came to visit Li. After talking, they got along exceptionally well. Especially when they criticized Mencius, they considered each other kindred spirits. They stayed together for ten days, scolding Mencius every day. They finished all the old Shaoxing wine that had been stored in Li's mansion for decades, and then the scholar left with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Afterwards, scholar Li thought about it and felt a little heartache, so he had to buy a few more jars despite the pain. Unexpectedly, not long after, that scholar came again after hearing about the wine. Scholar Li became anxious and quickly greeted him at the gate, stopping him from entering:</p>
<p>"After thinking about it, although Mencius is not good, his writing is still passable."</p>

<h3>Melon from Linxi, American Public Affairs</h3>
<p>Once, in the White House in Washington, a young staff member was near the office building—we don't say "while working," because there usually wasn't much work to do there—when he suddenly had severe stomach pains. The staff member in the same room quickly asked a junior staff member to get some "soda." Before the soda arrived, the young man had already been taken to the hospital. The order for "soda" had been issued, and no one thought to retract it. Soon, everyone had completely forgotten about this matter. Unexpectedly, this order for "soda" was being quietly carried out. The documents for this official matter were sent from one desk to another, from one division to another, from one bureau to another, from one level to another, with "following the instructions" all the way down, obtaining all the necessary signatures and seals. Three weeks later, the person in charge sent the "soda," worth one dime, to the office where the young man worked. No one knew what the medicine was for. Later, after some investigation, the truth was revealed, and they began to investigate the whereabouts of the young man. It took them five days to find out. The young man was already dead.</p>
<h3>Sea Adventures 23</h3>
<p>—By Captain Lauton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous excerpts described how in the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Kooks shipping company, and the mechanic Bill took the German ship "Kapellong Qi" to travel Europe. Because Britain and Germany declared war, the British warship was coming to intercept this ship. The ship frantically escaped. With great difficulty, they escaped and returned to the American territory of White Sea. Jack and Bill returned to New York to see Mr. Kooks. Kooks then asked them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a person named Johnson...</p>
<p>The two men walked away, the sound was quiet. Now, Jack was completely clear. Leaping up, clearly, there was some conspiracy in the radio air. But, he could not guess for a while how to deal with it.</p>
<p>"In any case, I will let Mullen know how to deal with it first," Jack thought, "He is an upright and unyielding person. He will not follow along with the monkey business. As for how to deal with Professor Lavicky, that's another matter. I think, it's better not to make a sound. If the 'Bowdick' knew, they would be monitored by the Germans. How can they not go crazy like water bees!"</p>
<p>11 Watching Him</p>
<p>Jack did not immediately reveal the mask of Mr. Johnson to Mullen, because he did not want to say the matter before consulting with Bill.</p>
<p>"I won't be fooled by that guy." Mullen said very faithfully. His tone made Jack feel very reassured.</p>
<p>Then, he went to the cabin to find Bill. Bill was writing a letter.</p>
<p>"Hey, Bill, I've exposed Mr. Johnson's mystery."</p>
<p>Bill immediately forgot about writing the letter. "Are you talking about that temperamental pepper shaker?"</p>
<p>"It's that guy, your old friend. You're not wrong, you said you remembered his voice."</p>
<p>"That devil, who is he?"</p>
<p>"What, who can compare to our German professor, Lavicky!"</p>
<p>"Good guy!" Bill shouted unexpectedly, "Old Wuji is here again?"</p>
<p>"That's right, and, to me, there is nothing good," Jack said, "I think, if he can play some tricks on me, he will never miss it."</p>
<p>"He should be sensible, and don't try." Bill waved his fist fiercely.</p>
<p>"The annoying thing is, I don't fully know what tricks he's playing."</p>
<p>"This is really too bad. We're ashamed we didn't discover him sooner. Otherwise, the British cruiser would thank us."</p>
<p>"Of course it would. Lumonggaro told me that Lavicky is a cunning and dangerous person. He has developed a new type of explosive and is very active in the German military."</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, where is the gear going?" Bill asked.</p>

<h3>Export Volume Increases Compared to Pre-War; Domestic Tea Exports Become Increasingly Prosperous; Southwest Provinces Open New Tea Areas; Mechanized Tea Production Achieves Success</h3>
<p>Since the government has encouraged the export of domestic goods, domestic tea exports have become increasingly prosperous, and export volume has increased compared to pre-war. The Southwest provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan have opened new tea areas and are engaged in increasing production. Mechanized tea production has achieved success. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Exports Increase After the War</p>
<p>The Foreign Trade Commission, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, controls all tea in the country, and cooperates with Fuhua Company to be responsible for the purchase and export of domestic market goods. Last year, a total of 800,000 boxes of tea were purchased, and about half of them were sold to various countries. 264,000 boxes were transported overseas to exchange for war supplies and construction materials. In addition, the number of red and green brick tea transported to the Soviet Union was also huge. According to China's tea export volume, it was 30,787,274 national currency in 1937, but last year it increased to 33,054,085 national currency.</p>
<p>Southwest Provinces Open New Tea Areas</p>
<p>The government has recently increased tea production, which helps exports, and has enriched foreign exchange funds. New tea areas have been opened in the Southwest provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Kangding. Technical personnel have been dispatched to investigate and implement the project. The new tea in the provinces that have not yet fallen has already begun to be on the market, and Fuhua Company will continue to purchase it in a unified manner. Due to the progress of weather and cultivation, exports are expected to increase even more than last year.</p>
<p>Mechanical Tea Making Achieves Good Results</p>
<p>In order to develop the tea industry, various banks are actively providing loans to tea farmers and tea merchants. China Farmers' Bank, Jiaotong Bank, and other banks have cooperated with provincial banks and local banks to tentatively set the total loan amount at 20 million national currency to help support development. Now, many tea factories in the interior are also trying mechanical tea making, and have new equipment such as engines, twisting machines, lump breaking machines, and screening machines. The results are quite good.</p>

<h3>Problems of Popular Literature and Art in South China</h3>
<p>—Luo Ying</p>
<p>The reason why "Literature to the Countryside" cannot be quickly unfolded is that some articles themselves are too narrow. They are only suitable for the appreciation of a few intellectuals, but cannot be understood by the masses, let alone accepted by the masses. In cities, their readers already account for a minority; in rural areas, they are even fewer. In order to complete the task of "Literature to the Countryside," the promotion of popular literature and art has become an important task at this stage.</p>
<p>Popular literature and art should not only be developed to the masses in cities, but also penetrate into the broad rural masses. When it can be universally distributed to the countryside, it will be the day when popular literature and art can be established. From this point of view, popular literature and art to the countryside has become an urgent task for cultural people.</p>
<p>How can popular literature and art be brought to the countryside?</p>
<p>Generally, literary and artistic works meet readers through individual books and miscellaneous publications. Whether these publications can penetrate into rural areas is questionable; even if a few have been placed in front of the rural masses, whether these unfamiliar books can arouse their interest in reading is also questionable; then there is no need to fantasize that they will be willing to spend a few pennies to buy something they do not understand. If popular literary and artistic works still use this method to go to the countryside, the effect will still not be greater than that of general literature and art. At least, in terms of form and price, they cannot approach the masses.</p>
<p>General local popular literary and artistic works. Like "Cantonese opera", "Dragon Boat", and "Chapters Returning to Novels" are able to circulate and penetrate into the broad readership, their forms and prices are close to the masses, which is one of the reasons. It only costs a copper coin to buy one or two favorite literary and artistic works, and it costs a few cents to buy a whole set of "masterpieces." These are the things they are happy to buy and love to read.</p>
<p>New literary and artistic works, of course, must adopt this method to promote the countryside, which is beyond doubt. In addition, we must use all possible ways to approach the masses, such as small newspapers, newspaper supplements, leaflets, periodicals, mimeographed publications, wall newspapers, etc.; either sold cheaply or distributed free of charge, always seeking to contact them in many ways. When they become accustomed to the appearance and content of these publications, they will naturally move from approaching to needing. At that time, the purpose of popular literature and art to the countryside has been achieved, and the task of popular literature and art has been completed.</p>
<p>The recitation of popular poetry and the singing of folk songs, especially for the general illiterate rural masses, are important tasks. Its ability to be deeply engraved in the minds of the masses is more effective than simply teaching them to read works.</p>
<p>The unfolding of this work is particularly difficult at ordinary times without mobilizing a large number of publicity workers. During the war of resistance, staff members were spread throughout the vast countryside, and it was even more incredible to promote it from them. It can achieve more incredible results.</p>
<p>With the right opportunity, with a vast workplace, and with an unlimited number of manpower, without making full use of it, making it impossible to establish popular literature and art, making it impossible for popular literature and art to go to the countryside, so that the war of resistance and culture cannot cooperate with each other, cultural people should bear the responsibility.</p>
<p>In the past two years of the war of resistance, all cultural departments have used all their strength to promote the all-out war of resistance and complete the task of eliminating traitors. For a time, they were unable to concentrate all their strength to launch a mass literature and art movement and unfold the work of mass to the countryside. Now, when all cultural workers, whether authors or staff, are mobilized to unanimously take on this responsibility, and use all effective promotional methods, quickly unfolding the work, can they truly complete the task of the all-people's war of resistance.</p>
<p>In many areas that have fallen to the enemy, the enemy is taking advantage of the chaotic and urgent time, and using all possible ways to approach the masses, to conduct counter-propaganda work on our compatriots, and sometimes can achieve considerable results. If we still do not exert all our strength to educate the people and win over the masses, isn't it that our propaganda work is not even catching up with the enemy?</p>
<p>According to reports from all parties, the work of popular literature and art to the countryside has been done very well in some areas of the war zone in North China. However, in South China, we still need to double our efforts and catch up quickly in order to make up for the work that has not been done enough before.</p>
<h3>Commiserating with Those Homesick</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>I yearn for that day.</p>
<p>The wanderer who has left home for many years, spends a long period of time, enduring hardship, wandering like tumbleweeds in the frosty mornings, in the yellow dust of the paths, under the dim moon and scattered stars. In desolate ruins and wild inns, on horseback, at the ferry, in dreams, the warm light of reunion, the family gathered around the stove, or under the bean and melon trellis, finishing the day's work, that pond, that ancient tree by the village, the monastery in the small town, the trivial anecdotes of foolish men and women, the ancestral old house, the lovely atmosphere of the family in the house, you will remember them all. When homesickness grinds a person into depression, when you first set out on the road home, when you abandon your homeland, resolutely with unyielding confidence, struggling to the death, after your career is successful, you return to the familiar environment, perhaps you feel sad, you shed tears, but you can't help but feel the happiness of reunion.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you went on a distant journey, you held down your homesickness with brave hands, concealed your awkward childish behavior, threw yourself into the embrace of the motherland, and embarked on an unfamiliar journey, on the yellow sand plateau, in the overlapping mountains, in the plains with many cloudy seasons, between the turbulent river and the cliffs, filled with a group of exiles. Coming from afar, each person has a memory of afar. That lost afar makes people feel melancholy and yearn for it. Isolated from afar, then capture that afar again. Capture that smoke, that dream, that old country, that green mountain.</p>
<p>You endure hardship in order to capture it, letting future laughter be exchanged for difficult wandering, letting homesickness be exchanged for glorious victory reports. You endure; you think of it from afar, capturing that afar, constructing fantasy from isolation. Everyone has their afar, the Hu horse depends on the north wind. The Yue bird faces the south branch, people of Jiangnan love fragrant grass, people of Saibei love cattle and sheep, looking at the evening cooking in poor alleys, some people think of the plank houses during mosquito thunder, the ape cries in high mountains and large swamps, some people think of the frog drums between thatched houses and ponds.</p>
<p>It is not just your own. Your afar, you think of Saibei, you think of Jiangnan, you should know that there are also the home mountains of thousands of people, the homes of friends, the homes of ancestors, the tombs of past ancestors, the fragrant breath of the land. Separation is naturally a lament, but reunion is even happier.</p>
<p>Like a dream, like a fairy tale, like rebirth, you take a piece of homesickness, a grain of sand and grass, you shrink the land as if Fei Changfang returned from exile to become your native, you hear many stories of innocent people suffering, intact houses turning to ashes, slaughter, coercion, ignorance, fraud, creating unprecedented tragedies in the world, perhaps the unfortunate people are your good friends and relatives, perhaps the burning of the houses includes your share, like you can't help but mourn, the blank space in your fate, the vicissitudes in separation. But you are ultimately happy. Isolated from afar, and then capture that afar. Separation is sad, but reunion is even more joyful.</p>
<p>Where is your home? In Saibei. In Jiangnan. For the sake of your greater career, you have traveled far away with difficulty, on horseback, at the ferry, in dreams, you send a piece of homesickness from afar, to the great river, to the returning geese, to the white clouds and the bright moon.</p>
<p>Capture that afar, the old country and green mountains will smile for you. Your fragrant grass of Jiangnan, your cattle and sheep of Saibei.</p>

<h3>A Pilgrimage to Zhabei, Shanghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>Now, only the occasional shouts of Japanese sailors from the Daqing Lane barracks nearby, and the sounds of trams in the Public Concession, break through the deathly silence. The buildings on the two roads, built from 1935 to 1936, still stand tall, the second and third floors have been fitted with Italian windows and turned into Japanese sailors' barracks, this building is also surrounded by high fences, with sentries guarding the gate, other than that. The Japanese side allows the damaged houses to take their own course. On the gray walls, there are still black holes with four sides, densely bombarded by the Japanese army, navy and air force for three months, the bricks loosened by the vibration have not been removed, and in some places, you can still see the steel bars in the ruins.</p>
<p>The wooden buildings around the two roads were the first to bear the brunt of the Japanese bombing, and the remaining wood is being dismantled by a group of Chinese coolies supervised by the Japanese side. In the entire Zhabei area, I only saw three groups of coolies, one of which was dismantling a half-destroyed church, neatly stacking the bricks, perhaps to be used for building houses that the Japanese side wants to build. Apart from this group of coolies, and a busload of Chinese people waving their passes to Japanese sentries at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Baoxing Street, I saw less than twenty Chinese people in Zhabei in three hours.</p>
<p>However, although the Chinese residents of Zhabei have decreased, they have not disappeared, on every main road, especially on Baoxing Road, a patrol sentry stands every fifty yards, quietly watching everyone and every vehicle passing by from behind trees, corners of houses and obstacles. On the bridge, a small team of patrol sailors carefully checks the passes of several farmers crossing the bridge. Why is Zhabei, which has been occupied for nineteen months, still so heavily guarded like an armed camp. Is it because Zhabei is the front door to the Japanese military base in the concession? Or is it for fear of guerrilla attacks known overseas? This is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>If Japan has the funds and opportunities to start economic recovery, then Zhabei, the "Little Tokyo" of Shanghai, is of course the ideal place for this plan, within a mile of Zhabei, there is a port, where Japan can continuously transport construction materials; in Shanghai itself, there are thousands of laborers looking for work, and many people are eager to return to their hometowns where they grew up. In "Little Tokyo," there is an unlimited supply of management ability and technical knowledge, and Japan has concentrated a large number of army, navy, air force soldiers, airplanes and warships in the entire Shanghai area, enough to protect Zhabei from attacks by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Then how can we explain why Japan has not started its heavily publicized plan? The answer to this is that for Japan's entire economic and political activities in China, Japan now finds that the "sacred mission" of conquering and pacifying China is beyond its ability.</p>
<p>Nearly two years ago, when Japan started the current war, its original plan was to strengthen its power in North China by flaunting its military power, but China, which fought desperately, responded to Japan's challenge, so the war spread to Shanghai, and the "Incident" became a major war, which was truly Japan's miscalculation. As the war has expanded, the expenses required by Japan have increased rather than decreased. To this day, its total is approximately equal to the total revenue of Japan, and at the same time, the funds that can be obtained are absorbed by heavy industry, two years ago, the funds available for economic development in North China have now been exhausted, empty, therefore, it has to issue shocking news such as Tokyo suggesting that it has formulated an economic plan for North China.</p>
<p>Even more important than this is that without the cooperation of more than 100 million Chinese people living in the so-called "occupied area," no kind of revival is possible. Unfortunately, Japan, its warships have not won the favor of the masses to this day, the Japanese army continues to carry out terrible wars, making China's hatred of the invaders grow with new strength, which can be proved by the increasing prevalence of guerrilla warfare and the increasing number of Japanese troops dispatched. To this day, it is still shouting the "pacification of the occupied area." Alas! The small and broken Zhabei is enough to make Japan realize that engaging in aggression is equal to futility, and is an ominous sign of future tragic consequences!</p>

<h3>Throwing Oneself Towards the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>— A Story of a Girl —</p>
<p>"No wonder she was so scared, I think there must be a reason."</p>
<p>At this time, a sharp whistle sounded, and then the car that had just retreated came over again.</p>
<p>"That's good, the alarm has been lifted."</p>
<p>People quickly ran back, afraid of losing their original seats.</p>
<p>Jing stood up lazily, carrying the basket of fruit, and constantly grumbling in her mouth:</p>
<p>"In fact, this alarm is completely unnecessary, there are no planes coming."</p>
<p>"How do you know there are no planes coming? You really have to wait for the plane to reach the top of your head before stopping, I'm afraid we won't even be able to run away."</p>
<p>"Humph, I don't believe I'll be bombed to death."</p>
<p>Qingzhi didn't bother to say anything to her, climbed onto the car, and sat down quietly. She felt that Jing's attitude had changed a bit, just like the shortcomings of girls that some people used to talk about, not deep, not profound, and lacking patience, and also constantly complaining about others.</p>
<p>The car continued to drive, and the peaceful fields were quickly left behind, when the car stopped again, it had reached a station in the middle of the journey. From the car, you could see the collapsed and dilapidated buildings, the roof was gone, and the beams and pillars were charred; but the railway employees were still working very excitedly.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is the spirit we should have." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Zhengji Company Dispute Case Comes to an End, The Original Person in Charge is Ordered to Carry Out the Liquidation Procedures</h3>
<p>Zhengji Shipping Co., Ltd. was sued by shareholder Shangji to the Chongqing Court for dissolution of the company due to certain behaviors, and the court ordered the dissolution of the company and appointed a liquidator to carry out the liquidation. Shangji stated that Zhengji Company had six ships docked in Hong Kong, so he filed a petition with the Hong Kong Court to end the company and carry out the liquidation. In addition to the Hong Kong Court scheduling a hearing on July 3 (ie yesterday), it has also appointed a temporary liquidator to take over the Zhengji Company's ships docked in Hong Kong first. The Hong Kong High Court opened the trial at 10 am yesterday. Those who appeared in court on that day included Lawyer Chai Shile from the Blundell Law Firm, Barrister Botada, Barrister Mai Nanmazi, Barrister Luo Huixun, etc. on the Shangji side, and Company Representative Lawyer Songben, and Barrister Dejin, Barrister Xerru, Barrister Liao Ya Mazzata, etc. on the Zhengji Company side. When the court opened in the morning, Barrister Botada stated various reasons, which took a long time, and before the debate could begin, the office hours had passed. At 2:30 pm, the hearing continued, and Barrister Botada reported to the judge, [1] Zhengji Company had been ordered to dissolve by the Chinese court in the place of registration, [2] Zhengji Company Hong Kong Branch had in fact ceased operations, [3] Zhengji Company could not operate because the Japanese army sealed the coast, and if it could operate, it would be in a special relationship, and it would violate the Chinese criminal law. Since Zhengji Company had been ordered to dissolve by the Chinese court first, and then rejected by the Chinese court, the company should be ended. The lawyer on the Zhengji Company side also stood up to argue, and at around 4 pm, the judge ruled to end Zhengji Company, and the original temporary liquidators, Cai Zengji, Wang Yunwu, and Shi Zhisanshi continued to perform their duties. After the judgment was completed, the court adjourned, and the lawsuit came to an end.</p>
<h3>Building Merchants Request to Reduce the Price of Sea Sand, Which Has Recently Increased to Two Yuan per Dan, Building Merchants Inevitably Face the Risk of Loss</h3>
<p>In 1935, the government controlled sea sand to avoid arbitrary excavation and affect the balance of the coastline, and established a sea sand control office, designated locations and excavation methods, and entrusted merchants to manage the matter. The merchants sold the excavated sea sand to the sea sand control office, which then sold it to the building merchants in batches for construction purposes. Six years ago, the price at which merchants sold to the control office was 64 cents per dan, and the control office sold it to the building merchants for 1 yuan and 25 cents per dan, which was later increased to 1 yuan and 50 cents, and the building merchants once discussed it and petitioned, but the price increase was only 25 cents, and they did not want to start negotiations because of this small amount, and the matter was settled. However, recently it has suddenly increased to 2 yuan per dan, that is, an increase of 50 cents per dan, so the most affected are the building merchants, because the buildings under construction, the contracts have been set, the previous sea sand value was only 1 yuan and 50 cents, and the budget also estimated 1 yuan and 50 cents, and now it has increased by 50 cents, then the budget will be exceeded, the small projects are not a problem, the large projects, it is inevitable that there will be a risk of loss, it may not be possible to ask the owners to increase the price, so the general builders are very anxious, and are currently jointly selecting representatives to request the sea sand control office to improve, in order to help merchants.</p>

<p>Recently, traffic accidents on the island have increased sharply. According to police statistics from last week, a total of 120 cases occurred, an average of 17 cases per day, setting the highest record in Hong Kong's history. Among the vehicles involved in accidents, private cars are the most numerous, which is a matter that deserves attention. It was reported that at midnight yesterday, a certain private car was driving eastward along Queen's Road Central. The car carried two young men in Western suits and one fashionable young woman. One of the young men was driving, with the woman sitting beside him. They sped along, and when they reached the intersection of Wing Kut Street, a blind street vendor happened to be walking down Aberdeen Street wearing wooden clogs and carrying an iron can on his back, calling out to sell salty crispy peanuts along the way. He was crossing the road, only a few feet away from the sidewalk, when the car sped towards him and, in an instant, knocked the blind vendor down. After the accident, the young driver immediately stopped to inspect the scene, dragged the blind vendor out from under the car, and helped him to the edge of the drain in front of Leung Sun Kee's shop. At that time, there were no less than dozens of onlookers. The young man then abandoned the blind vendor and drove away, without taking him to the hospital for examination or reporting the case to the police. The onlookers all felt indignant for the blind vendor.</p>

<h3>Football Association: Tenth Annual Meeting; Silver Shield Competition Profit Distribution Also Submitted to the Annual Meeting for Approval; Team Planned to be Sent to Shanghai in November to Hold Postponed Interport Match</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Football Association will hold its annual general meeting of members at the Association on the 10th of this month (Monday) at 5:30 pm. Mr. Gordon Bee, the honorary secretary of the association, has already notified all members, so that each member association can send representatives to the meeting to jointly promote the work of the association. In addition to ordinary matters such as elections, the annual meeting on the 10th will also involve three items related to supplementing and amending the association's articles of association, which are more important than previous annual meetings.</p>
<p>Agenda of the Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The agenda of the members' annual meeting is as follows: (1) Reading and passing the minutes of the previous year's members' annual meeting; (2) Accepting and passing the association's financial report for 1938-1939; (3) Electing the officers for the 1939-1940 year (excluding honorary secretaries); (4) Electing one representative each from the Category B and C staff; (5) If deemed appropriate, consider and pass the following amendments to the articles of association: (A) After Article 13 of the articles of association, add the following sentence: "The honorary secretary appoints a deputy honorary secretary to assist in his work, but this appointment must be approved by the association's council.

<p>Work Report</p>
<p>The Football Association also issued a report on the association's affairs for the 1938-1939 year yesterday, which is translated as follows: The association is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting on the 10th of this month. The work report for this session was released yesterday. According to estimates, the results are very satisfactory. The current profit is $7,448.70, which, together with the accumulated surplus of $4,637.28 from the previous session, totals $12,935.98 in deposits. At the same time, this result was achieved by making every effort to economize on expenses. The association's office address is now spacious, and the rent is fair. This was obtained through the introduction of Treasurer Fleming. Now, a portion has been demarcated and sublet to the Bille Company, with each party bearing half of the rent. A total of 30 member associations have joined, including six new units. The association's affairs are usually decided by the executive committee. A total of 12 such meetings were held, and an additional special meeting was held during the year, which resulted in the adoption of a resolution inviting the Hong Kong Chinese Amateur Athletic Federation to send a representative to participate as a member of the association's executive committee. Fortunately, no appeal incidents occurred in this session, so the committee members were not additionally convened. Although a small number of games in each group were forced to be postponed due to environmental influences, all of them were completed within the specified time limit. There were a total of 12 incidents of player fouls in the competition, which have been punished separately. Because the war in China has not ended, the Hong Kong-Shanghai interport match in this session has been canceled and is planned to be rescheduled in November of this year. The newly established Hong Kong-Philippines interport match was held in February when the Philippine team came to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong team won the match. However, when the Hong Kong team went to the Philippines in April to reciprocate, it failed twice. In the past, the Hong Kong team in the Hong Kong-Macau interport match was represented by players from Category B. In this session, at the request of Macau, players from Category A were sent to fight, resulting in a 2-0 victory. All six major trophies in this session fell into the hands of the Chinese team. $7,700 was raised for the International Cup and has been donated to various charitable organizations in Hong Kong, with a maximum of $800 and a minimum of $200. The European War Peace Memorial Charity Race resulted in $2,340.03, which has been remitted back to the United Kingdom. During the year, the Singapore Chinese football team came to Hong Kong and had several matches, which were quite remarkable. The South China Athletic Association and the Eastern Athletic Association formed a team to expedition to Haiphong and Hanoi, which was approved by the association in advance.</p>
<h3>Diary of a Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Chen Dehui</p>
<p>June 6th</p>
<p>After yesterday's match with the Haiphong team, we immediately returned to Hanoi in a hurry. The night journey was very tiring. Therefore, most of the team members did not get up until 10 o'clock. After having congee, we immediately started preparing for the afternoon's trip to Saigon. Comrade Zhuo Shijin's condition did not improve much in the morning after seeing a doctor and taking medicine. Team Leader Ying believed that it would be better for Comrade Zhuo to follow the doctor's advice and not travel while sick. Therefore, it was decided that Zhuo would take a flight back to Hong Kong tomorrow to recuperate. In the afternoon, all the team members gathered and took a car to the train station. Several staff members of the Football Association had already arrived to say goodbye, and made earnest promises to meet again later. Before long, the whistle sounded, and the train slowly moved. Our group set off south again.</p>
<p>June 7th</p>
<p>Today, we only sat bored in the carriage, listening to the deafening sound of the engine. It was quite depressing because the long day was boring and lacked entertainment. Although the fields outside the carriage were endless and green, it was difficult to appreciate them because the train was moving like an arrow. Fortunately, Comrade Guangsen sang loudly from time to time, and Brother Qingcai accompanied him with the Jinghu, which reduced the boredom of the journey.</p>
<p>Ying Qi, who is good at Go, also does not lack experts among our group. So, we started by challenging him, then playing against him. In the end, Ying Qi was one step ahead and successively defeated Rongzhao, Jingxiang, Genbao and others. Ying Qi can also be proud of himself.</p>
<p>June 8th</p>
<p>Morning light filled the window, and the air was refreshed. We entered the territory of South Vietnam. At 10 am, we arrived in Saigon. Those who came to welcome us included Fatty Hitler, the former team leader of the Saigon team, and Mr. Liu Zeng and others. After the greetings, we took a car to the Vortex Palace Hotel. As soon as we unloaded our luggage, we all rushed to take a bath, because we had been traveling for two nights and a day, and the heat was unbearable, and our bodies were soaked in sweat. We felt very uncomfortable, and this was not enough to rejuvenate ourselves. At 4 pm, Team Leader Mo ordered all the players to go to the stadium to practice running. After dinner, the team members went their separate ways. Before 10 o'clock, they all returned to their rooms to sleep.</p>
<p>June 9th</p>
<p>We returned to the stadium for practice at 8 am, because the great enemy was in front of us, and we could not slack off. The training ended after 45 minutes. After dispersal, some team members went to visit Di'an, and some went to the park for a walk. Only Team Leader Mo, Secretary Zhou, and Captain Bao went to visit our Consul in Saigon, Mr. Zhuo. After they returned, Mr. Zhu Zhonghao arrived to ask about Comrade Zhuo Shijin, because Mr. Zhu knew that Comrade Zhuo had traveled south with the team, but did not know that he had fallen ill and returned halfway. At night, Team Leader Ru led all the team members to watch a movie. After the show ended, we returned to the hotel to sleep.</p>

<p>Therefore, all affairs were handled by the permanent secretary Gehrgeg Deneoy (1810-1917). Coincidentally, the 15th French Gymnastics Assistance Association was also held at this time. Representatives of sports groups who attended included Belinm BaCland Aucby of Lusimbury The Three Rcan Dinaranouotrles Rohenia And Suitsctland, while Scaadiorvians did not participate in the competition and practiced independently. Gymnastics was presented to the public, and sports experts from Foksoom only performed Swedish gymnastics. The second International Gymnastics Association ongres lnternanad deld Ducotion Prysfgue was held from August 30th to September 6th, 1900, during the Paris World Expo. Secretary Cemeny was solely responsible for the competition held in Paris this year.</p>
<p>International Atumuic Council Rules, A Purpose,</p>
<p>(1) According to the Paris Conference on June 23, 1894, the International Olympic Games Committee was established with three objectives: (1) to implement the rules of the competition; (2) not to despise the glorious history of the past, and to strive for the complete realization of the ideals of modern competition; (3) to convene a competition every four years to guide modern athletic methods.</p>
<p>(2) The International Olympic Games Committee is permanent. The maximum number of members from each country is three, but the number of participating countries is unlimited. Each national committee has the right to attend the International Olympic Games Committee as a representative of the sports league association. Each committee member has independent voting rights that are not infringed upon by any league association within their own country.</p>
<p>(3) Each committee member who has served for more than two years during a certain period and has not participated in declarations, gatherings, or voting is deemed to have resigned. Violations of honor and etiquette that infringe upon the interests of local committee members will result in the removal of their committee membership.</p>
<p>B Implementation of Duties</p>
<p>(4) International Olympic Committee members are appointed by the president for a term of eight years and may be reappointed. The president is the external representative of the committee and can implement the duties of the committee in collaboration. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Today, the Olympic ruins are desolate.</p>
