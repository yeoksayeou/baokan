<h3>怎樣培養青年幹部？　介紹陜北公學的教學經驗</h3>
<p>— 邵式平</p>
<p>（特稿）現在大家都曉得了，陝北公學是一個堅持抗戰，堅持待久戰，堅持統一戰線，實施國防敎育，培養抗戰榦部的學校。因爲它——陝北公學；已經在事實上成了大國靑年「高山仰止，景行行止，雖不能至，心嚮往之」的一個學校，我在這裏不想對陝公再來作一次全面的說明，只就陝公的教學方法上說些點滴經驗，也許我們的經騐是很淺薄的，但在今天舊教育瀕於破產，新敎育國防敎育，——正在困難中生長起來的時候，貢献點滴經驗，以供全國熱心國防教育人士的參考，想來也不是完全沒有意義的。</p>
<p>一　陜北公學教學上的特點</p>
<p>陝北公學是在抗戰中產生和發展來的，它的特點很多，這裏我只就敎學上說幾點：</p>
<p>一，陝公的敎學方法是建立在正確的敎育方針之上的。敎學方法是所以實施學校方針的一切辦法，不簡單的是講堂上溝課技術問題。一個學校的敎育方針是正確的。他才能有很多很正確的敎學方法：如果方針是不正確的。離開學校的教育方針來空談敎育方法，是無論如何不會有止確的敎學方法的。同時即使敎育方針是正確，如果敎學方法採取得不對，不僅不能實現正確的方法，甚向正確的敎育方針，反被不好的敎學方法所妨礙，或者减少其實現性。這些都是普通的眞理。陝北公學在敎學方法上，首先就非常着重敎學方針的問題。陝公的敎育方針，堅持抗戰，堅持持久戰，堅待統一戰綫，實現國防敎育，培養抗戰幹部。這是否正確呢？當然是完全正確的。但敎育方法不是一句空話，而是要在具體問題上去體現出來的。這裏必然聯系而來的問題，就是敎材內容的問題。敎什麽？學什麽？在對學校敎育方針與敎學力法上，是有决定意義的。敎的東西不正確，例如學校方面是要培養抗戰建國的人材。而敎的東西却不是抗戰建國的東西。甚而抗戰建國綱領，把蔣委員長的吿民衆書，目前抗戰的一切實際經騐敎訓，丟在一邊；而亂敎一頓子曰詩的，這樣的學校。栽載戴斷說一句，無論如何是敎不好的。北陝學公對於敎內容卽村敎些什麽，非常重視。爲解决敎材內容求得正確，求得與敎育方針的一致，求得理論與實踐的一致，曾特別着重各科研究工作，搜集各方面的經驗敎訓，如以研究整理，並且把每個抗戰中大的實際的問題，不斷的列舉敎村的內容，加强了該書的建設，設立了廣播的收昔機，並盡可能的從各方，特別的是從學主中去搜集各方面的實際材料，以求學校敎學內容的正確切實與豐富，我們雖然沒有做到意想的程度，或者尚有不少的缺點，但在這方面的注意和努力，重視着個問題，是陝公敎學上首先的特點，陝公敎畢方法就建立在他的正確的敎育方針和正確的敎育內容的基礎之上的。</p>
<p>二，陝公敎學方法是建立在革命的基本原則之上的。原來敎學方法是社會生產方法的反映，中國社會發展的不平衡，各色各樣的生產方法同時存在着，反映到敎學方法上來，也就有各種各色的不同。例如，帝國主義壓迫屠殺殖民地的方法在中國是存在着的，由此，屠殺學生，佔領學校，野蠻的壓迫學生的敎育方法也就存在着。封建的强制性剝削的生產方法，在中國社會是存在着的，由此，封建式的打屁股，關閉，餓飯的敎學方法也就存在着。資本主義經濟强制扣工資，記過，開除出工廠的生產方法，在中國社會也是存在着的。由此，資本主義式的扣學分，記過，開除學籍的方法也就存在着。陝北公學不僅不採取，而且不能採用上述許多對立的敎學方法。我們深刻知道陝公也是革命的學校，是抗戰建，的學校，是培養抗戰幹部的學生，由此，在教學方法上，只能根據革命的基本原則。原來革命是要依靠廣大民眾積極起鬥來爭才能勝利的。在羣眾尚沒有了解到革命行動的必要時，革命的領導者，只有耐性的去說服羣眾，要基於從羣衆自已的經騐中去獎勵羣衆，提高羣衆，動員和組織羣衆，絕對不能在大多民衆尚未從自已的經騐了解到革命是迫切需要的時，候領導者採取命令强迫方法去强迫羣衆，來革命，這是不可以的。而且是必然踫壁的。陝公的敎學方法，就是根據這個原則而生出來的。把這個原則運用到敎學的各方面，由此，敎學的精神，敎學的態度，敎學的立場，都在基本上與通去敎學是不同的。所以我把他叫做革命的敎學方法，也可以說是陝公敎學的特點。</p>
<p>三，陝北公學敎學方法是建立在敎，學一致的原則上的。敎與學原來是矛盾統一的東西。敎學方法，就在整個敎學過程中去解决敎與學之間的矛盾而使其統一起來。這裏不能不估計到陝公學生程度的不齊，在不齊的當中要了解到統一的地力，這就是抗戰建國的要求是一致。從抗戰高於一切的原則之下，一切問題都是具體的得到解决，而使他統一起來，具體的是那些問題呢？學生與學生之間的關係，敎員與學員之間的關係，職員學員與敎員之間的關係，敎的內容與學的了解之間的關係，敎的分量與學員接受的程度之間的關係，各黨派各階段各地方各種不同之程度之間的關係，敎育方針，計劃內容都與敎學方法的關係，有矛盾存在着的，但在敎學上我們都注意求其統一與一致，這個求其一致方法，在敎學上就在變教育計劃為學習計劃，就在怎樣領導與組織學習，就在能靈活的按照具體環境的條件採取各種不同的方法來進行。人們以爲敎，學一致，就是敎了什麽學了什麽：陝公認爲這樣簡單來了解這個問題是不够的，必須要使敎，學的結果，實際完成了敎靑計劃，實現了學校的敎育方針，這樣的方法才是正確的，才是教，學的一致，陝公一年來培養了五千多幹部在各個戰綫上與×人肉搏血戰，在校同學忠誠團結緊張活發戰鬥的學習，全校不論是幹部，學員，異業的，在學的，團結的像一個人一樣，對於學校的保護，證明陝公敎學在基本上是成功的。雖然在敎學一致的問題上，我們還存在着某些弱點，但我們自已感覺，成功較弱點要多些。這也可以說是陝公敎學的一個特點。</p>
<p>四，陝公敎學方法是建立在具體環境之上的。問題是這樣的：在一定的條件下才能敎學呢？還是在變動的複雜的困難的條件下也能敎學呢？陝公的敎學方法，肯定的答覆是：在一定的條件下能够敎學，在變動複雜困難的條件下也能够敎學。在抗戰形勢發展的前面，後者較前者更爲重要。這就要按照當時當地具體環境來變動自已的敎學方法。如果不能改變自已的敎學方法來適應和改造環境，就將在某種新的變動下，不能完成其任務。試看全國敎育的現象，不乏具例，無庸詳說。這裏只說陝公是怎樣來解决這個問題的。在延安總校，沒有敎員，當時採取了請名人講演的方法來解决，到分校敎員一樣困難，又採取了研究室的方法來解决，敎員少，上大講堂，沒有敎室，露天上課，士匪企圖擾亂，我們就武裝保護學習，與當地民眾打成一片，取得當地黨，軍，政及廣大民衆的幫助。路不好走，自已開路，×人的飛機來。目己挖飛機洞，最後日×企圖進攻西北，學校就根本改編，開到×人後主去。沒有這些方法，就不能發展陝北公學，更莫想敎育計劃的完成。</p>
<p>關於陝公分校敎學方法的特點，大概說來就是這樣。</p>
<p>二　教育計劃就是學習計劃</p>
<p>一，敎育計劃是全校奮鬥的計劃。一個學校的敎育方針確定了。就得訂出具體的實施的計劃並由一切方法和力量來求其實現。完成敎育計劃是全校的任務，因此必須動員全校各組織各部門以至於各個人，能够自覺的積極的起來爲完成教育計劃而鬥爭。最主要的就是動昌敎員職員和學生，使敎員深切的了解自已爲什麽而敎，使職員能够了解到自已是什麽而工作，使學員够使自覺的了解到自己是爲什麼而學。只要大家都能正確了解到自已是什麽而敎，而學，而工作，就必然能自動的、積極的、團結一致的、爲完成其計劃而奮鬥。陝公爲了這個目的，首先就在校務會議上詳細的論到敎育計劃務求其止確，再動員各部門解釋畢校討任務與方針，提高大家政治情結，然後把敎育計劃，提到敎員研究室去討論；在開課的第一天，更提到學生中去討論；把敎育計劃詳細的向學生作報吿，使大家都了解在學校努力的目標是什麽？這樣就能發動全校一切人力、物力爲實現敎育計劃而奮鬥。有人以爲把敎育計劃提到學生中去討論，假如學生不同意怎樣辦呢？我想只怕不是正確的敎育計劃，如果是正確的，學生沒有不熱烈歡迎和擁護的。卽或個別的一下子不能了解，經過一番說服解釋之後也就能了解。一個學校的敎育計劃不敢向學生作報吿，學生只是盲目的學下去，根本就不能動員學生起來為敎育計劃而奮鬥：也就不能在事實完成學習，而要學校各方面敎育計劃。因爲如果學生不是自覺的，積極的學，而是用各種方法來督促，壓迫，强制學生學習，則敎學效力是失職的，甚至是失敗的。所以敎育計劃是否能够在實施中切實完成，就要把敎育計劃變爲全校一切工作的奮鬥中心，尤其是要成爲學生的學習計劃。</p>
<p>二，敎育計劃怎樣具體的變爲學習的計劃？動員全體學員了解敎育計劃，就是目已的學習計劃，僅是原則上的辦法，具體的辦法比原則上的辦法在工作中有時更爲重要。敎育計劃變爲學習計劃，宣傳解釋是一回事，而具體的執行又是一回事。這兩件是有聯系的同時又是分別的。陜公在這個問題上又怎樣辦呢？在敎育計劃訂定並宣傳解釋之後，敎務部就根據敎育計劃制定實施進度表，並大體的劃分出實施的階段。例如第一期四週，中國問題應完成那些問題，敎與學的時間有多少，在什麽時候。其他各課也是一樣。預先發給學員，由全隊學員職員和敎員開會依計劃改進度訂出每週的學習計劃，指出參考書，列出學習的大綱，再由各班去按全隊一週的學習計劃訂出本班全週周日的學習劃，預先由班畏向敎科代表把參考書分配好，按照預定時間或看參者書，或開討論會，或上課，都預先有準備，有佈置。還有其餘的時間，各個人可以規訂出多看參考畫的計劃，每日每人學習計劃的完成、就是每班學習計劃的完成，各班學習計劃的完成就是全隊的完成，也就是總的敎育計劃的完成。這個辦法我們叫做有計劃的學習。</p>
<p>三，完成了計劃沒有呢？有人這樣提出問題，就是這樣任各人自由學習，是否努力呢？是否全做假報吿呢？有什麽方法去了解呢？道是很重要的問題，但陝公對這個問題不是採取考試而是發動全體學員職員及敎員起來檢査。例如每班每週是否完成了自已的計劃呢？每禮拜六開全班學習計劃會議上就能够總結出來。因爲每日全班都在一塊生活着，學習着，大家又知道是爲什麽而學習，而且是自已訂出來的學習計劃，當然都會自動的積極的努力，而且在討論上就能了解各人學習的程度，因爲敎員職員都在參加學習和討論，同學們自動的發起學習競賽，互相幫助，互相加勉，誰在學習中努力和進步，大家都很了解。其次，就是定期的敎育計劃實施的大檢査。當計劃的每一個階投完畢時，敎務部就組織所有參加執行計劃的人員，如敎員，職員，學員及事務人昌起來開會檢查，大家預先準備意見，敎務部也預先收集各方面的材料並預先把材料考査整理，在檢査會議上，互相發揚其優點，指出其弱點。研究其優尖點的來源並克服的方法，並計劃新的奮門計劃。這樣敎育計劃，是否完成，還有什麽不能了解的呢？</p>
<p>四，敎育計劃的變動，敎育計劃不是死的，也不是一成不變的，尤其在抗戰建國形勢發展的前面，更不能一成不變，因爲許多問題今天是對的，到明天就不一定是對；由此敎育計劃就不能不多少要有變動，這種的變動，也就是學習計劃上的變動。陝公每當整個處獲有新的大發展的時候，必然訂也臨時學習計劃。例如第三期抗戰，保德武漢，論持久戰，論新階段：都特別訂出計劃來研究，而且經過這樣一次的研究，在敎與學的內容上必然有多少新的東西增加進去．這樣使敎？能與實際一致，同時也更使敎育計劃變成了學習計劃。因爲抗戰中的實際問題是大家所迫切要求了解的。有人以爲陝公敎育計劃變動太快，我認爲太快是事實。但實際生活上變動比我們敎育計劃變動更快啊！不過在基本上我們是沒有改變過的。這就是打日本，救中國。</p>
<p>關於敎育計劃就是學習計劃的問題，就是這樣。</p>
<p>三　教育方法的中心就在領導與組織與學習</p>
<p>我曾經說敎學方法，是實實學校敎育方計所採取的一切方法。這樣說來敎學方法包括的東西很廣泛，但其中心是在領導與組織學習。</p>
<p>一，怎樣叫做領導學習呢？就是要學習的東西，在學員看來一條從未走的生路，而敎員對這條路大概走過一二次的，至少方向是很能把握住的。因此敎員是學習上的一個響應，並帮助學習，克服學習上困難，這是一。其次，陝公的員都是革命的前進戰士，有的是革命的領袖，他們是爲抗戰建國而敎學，對于爲抗戰建國而來學習的青年，更是自覺要負起領導敎學的責任，如果說學校中心在學習，那末敎學的中心，就在領導學習。陝公的學昌都能了能解自已對靑年責任的重大，由此他們對敎材的研究，非常努力，常因用功過度而致病的，對于每週問題不能絲毫含糊過去，他們出席學員計劃會議，和討論會，細心解答學員中提出來的各種問區，與學員討論各種問題，在某些問題上，特別是抗戰建國實際工作上，因爲經驗不同，有時還向學員學習。例如關於民衆運動，特別是靑年，婦女運勸，許多學生從實際工作中來，他們有生動的材料，這些材料是值得收集起來研究的。只有這樣才能實現領導學習的責任。</p>
<p>一，怎樣叫做組織學習？學校有了敎育方針，有了敎育計劃，而且都是正確的，那末就要找到為實施敎育方針和劃而奮鬥力量。學生的組織，幹部的配備，就是實現敎育方計和計劃的力量。陝公的事生，一般地說，都是很熱情於抗戰建國的，陝公敎職員更是抗戰建國的戰士仲領袖，但是這樣的基礎這樣組織成為更大的學員力量呢？敎員按照各科組織在各研究室，學生就組織成學習班，分隊和隊，班是學習的單位，隊是敎育的單位，更按照敎育的單位，把這一部分敎員。工作人員和學員組織在敎育計劃之下共同努力，由此隊長成爲領導與組織學習的中心；班長成爲學習的核心；分隊長是敎育計劃實施與學習單位之間的僑梁；指導員是領導與組織學習的助手：學生會是組織學習的團體，學科代表是敎員與學員之間的聯系人，同時是組織一科學習的組織者。這樣，在爲爭取敎育計劃與學習計劃順利完成的目標之下，組織成了學習上的嚴的隊伍。只有這樣的力量，才能保證敎育計劃勝利。</p>
<p>三，領導與組織學習的中心一環。在敎員職員與學生之間的互相信任與互相尊敬。陝北公學的學員每見敎員到來時，多是掌聲如雷，表示對敎員的歡迎。還有個別的隊預備紙烟癮勞敎員，敎員要有時身體不和，學生卽派代表慰問，由學生看來，敎員都是靑年的領導者和組織者，應讓信仰和尊敬的。陝公的教員也確實負責，非萬不得已，决不肯請假缺課；如果偶然不得已而缺課；例如因大雨無敎室而缺課，有些敎員願意自動的黑夜或或期日去補課；還有個別敎員冒雨赤足上課，使全堂學員對他表示敬意。由敎昌看來，這一羣靑年是中國的命運的寄託者，是抗戰的將士，是羣眾的領袖，是中國的創造者；對他們多做一分工作，卽對抗戰建國增加了一分力量，是自已應盡的責任。我們的敎員何幹之同志送別畢業畢生上前統的大會上說：</p>
<p>「畢業上前統的同學，將用槍砲在前綫與×人肉搏血戰，我在這裏就用筆和口來與×人鬥爭，前綫後方，用一切武器和力量，要把日寇驅逐出中國去。」</p>
<p>由此可知陝公敎員把自已敎學事業看成抗戰建國神聖事業的一部，自已尊敬自已的事業，忠實自已的事業，同時也就是信任全體學員，把抗戰建國的神聖事業，屬望於自已和全國青年，這樣一來，在陝北公學從來沒有過學生罷課，敎員的事情，敎員，學員之間的互相信任和尊敬的關鍵，是職員。特別是隊長，隊長是教育計劃的執行者和組織者，他不僅中計劃全隊的學習，使一切工作為了爭取學習的勝利，同時，還得要組織和配備各種力量，原來學習也和打仗一樣，在火綫上隊，連，排，班長是非常重要的，敎學把一切計劃决定後，隊長指導員在學習上就有决定的意義。因爲隊長就必須為一切方法團結敎員組織學員，把一切可以出到領導與教育學習的力量，都該組織到領導與組織演習上去。只有這樣才能變更教育計劃為學習計劃，並能保障其勝利的實施。</p>
<p>四，組織與學習的競賽與具體的互相帮助。在學習上既有了計劃，又有了學習隊伍，於是隊與隊，班與班，個人與個人之間，在教學室，學生會的動員下，常為自愿的互相說出學習競賽，正同抗戰部隊中打仗競賽一樣。他們深刻知道自已的學習是抗戰的學習，由此互派代表商訂競賽的條例，並聘請評判員，把自己學習計劃和努力向評判員和競賽的對方作報告，互相學習優點，互相幫助克服弱點，榜樣能够使全校的學生造成一種學習運動，在運動中能够了解到個人的能力：品質：強的發揚他，弱的幫助他。這種幫助是很具體的。例如一個班為了要爭取競賽的勝利，必然全班內部各分子自己相互了解各個人的優缺點，而採取具體的辦法。有時特別决定某人帮助某人。這樣不僅是緊張了學習，同時也加強了團結。但這種競賽的組織，並不是學校的規定制度，而是出於學生自動的努力學習的一種方法。組織競賽者，往往是以學生會與救亡室爲中心的。不過所有的敎育都應積極贊助與幫助並指導其進行，防止形式的有名無實，有始無終的現象。如果學生沒有感覺到競賽的需要，只是一二個領導者制定一個競賽計劃宣佈一下，那就不如不要競賽更爲妥當。陝公在組織競賽上極大多數是成功的。有成績的，但也有個別的把競賽為兒戲，沒有發動起來，或者有個別的走到不正確的錦標雙向，還也是有的。但學校一發現有不正確的雙向，卽帮助迅速改正，這是青年領導應負的責任。</p>
<p>四　教學成功的意義</p>
<p>敎·學的勝利，應以什麽爲標準呢？有人以爲按照把計劃規定的書本子敎完就是勝利，其實這樣的了解是不够的，然而一樣的事實是到處可以遇到的。我以為教學成功不僅是簡單的教書本子的問題，其實沒有書本子。一樣可以敎學。陝公有許多功課就是沒有書本子的，陝公是否是敎學呢，是教學而且教的對。這是什麼道理？就是教育不簡單的是教書本子。其實教學的真正成功，我以為應有下列三個標準：</p>
<p>一，給學員以正確的知識，而學員確實了解和掌握住，並能靈活的運用到實際，不是條文的背誦，也不是公式死記。</p>
<p>二，培養學員不僅有知識有能力，幷且能為實現自己的所學，具有犧牲奮鬥的决心和信念，不是空談無補，更不做掛羊頭賣狗肉的份子。</p>
<p>三，有知識，能力，有决心，信心是基本的，是重要的，然而敎育的責任還不至此，同時還得要鍛鍊其身體，使具有力量担負其應担負的任務。</p>
<p>陝公把敎學的成功，放在上面所說的標準之下，於是深刻的知道敎育不僅是認識人材，重要的還是培養人材。原來是人材的固然很多，學校應該更加提高他發揚他，使他在抗戰建國中成為更堅强的幹部。原來尚未成爲人材須待學校培養成爲人材的是絕大多數，但他們有高度抗戰的熱情，學校更當用一切努力，使其熱烈的鼓舞的向前進步。卽或有一二意識比較落後，只要不是×孫，漢奸，託憑分子，學校都負有改造他的責任：耐性的說服，艱苦的敎育，有時為爭取一二個這樣的同學，常使學校負責同志耗費很長的時間去談話與教育。所以有同學認爲「在陝公尚且不能敎育出來的分子是不可救藥分子」。學校是這樣愛護人材，培養人材、由此同學也就非常然烈的愛護學校。學校的每一困難當前，全體同學莫不關心至切，特別在物質方面得到學生帮助很大捐欵捐舊捐無綫電，都有很大的成績。陝公一年來的發展，得力於同學是很大的。我在這裏向愛護陝公母校的同學表示抗戰建國的崇高敬意。</p>
<p>爲了完全教學的任務，個別的具體的敎育培養，愛護與帮助是很重要的。但一般的養成優良的校風，培養忠誠團結，緊張活潑的精神，艱苦奮鬥工作作風，提高學員的軍事能力和生活。更其重要，陝公的作風，最優良的是忠誠團結，緊張活潑。無論在學習中，工作中，生活中，無論在學生中，幹部中，都充分的表現出來。在這樣優良的校國黨陶之下，無論是共產黨員國民黨員及無黨派的人員，都團結得像一個人一樣，互相敬愛，互相信任，一致為學校任務學校的教育計劃努力奮鬥。在建立和發揚優良的校風中，幹部的學範作用，幹部的學習，幹部的團結，是非常重要的關鍵。陜公在幹部政策上是很有成績的。學校對於幹部的愛護和敎育，是一種經常的工作。例如榦部班每週上課二次，分校自開始直到改編後沒有放鬆過。幹部的提高和團結，就是提高和團結全校的中心，也是達到敎學勝利的目的的基礎。</p>
<p>陝公在新的形勢下，是在採取新的姿態的向前發展着，我相信在全國的愛護與全校的努力之下，必然能有新的奮鬥中獲得新的成績的。我自陝公成立直到改編都在陝公任敎務工作，深愧不學無能，什麽道爾領制，杜威敎育哲學；都沒有研究過，在中國共產黨中央領導下，孫隨成，羅兩校長之後，拚着自已的努力和全校同學及敎職員的幫助，幸吿無罪，自引以爲快。現奉令統調前綫，形式上不得不聲開陝公，特將點滴經驗寫出，以請敎於全國熱心國防敎育者，同時敬祝陝公同志和同學的康健。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>新階段的青年運動</h3>
<p>二十年前的今天，一個在全中國為空前的，在全世有其模範作用的靑年運動會，由當時的北京學生發動起來，在流血的鬬爭中，在堅决的挺進中，喚醒了而且喚起了在封建殘餘與××主義壓迫下的全中華民族，它由純粹的學生愛國運動，發展為青年界的以至包括工商農各界的政治運動，更進而發展為中國近代史上的新啓蒙運動，開拓了一九二五至二七年的大革命的前途，更開拓了中華民族從民主的科學的運動中走向建立「民族獨立，民權自由，民生幸福」的新中國的大路。</p>
<p>二十年前的今天，中華民族開始發出要求解放的第一次的怒吼，而旦動員了自學生以至工人商人農民最後還吸引了廣大兵士，來進行要求解放的鬬爭。這種吼聲和鬬爭，早被公認爲東方文化新生的信號和警鐘了！而中國靑年則以先鋒姿態，與世界相見，並且佔據了世界進步運動中非常重要的地位。</p>
<p>二十年後的今天，全中華民族已經繼承二十年前的今天所開始的光榮的鬥爭的精神，爲了中華民族的解放和保衞世界文化的新生，而捲入了空前的牽動全世界的抗日戰爭之中。這個戰爭在全中國在令世界都已發生打破歷史紀錄的影響，它已經獲得勞動者自已創造的雄偉的社會主義國家的全力支持，它更獲得全世界愛護民主與和平的資本主義國家和廣大的正義人類的同情與援助，它已經發揚光大了二十年前今日所發動的革命運動，而且二十二個月的艱苦戰鬥中奠定了勝利的基礎。雖然如此，我們同時還要竭誠指出我們這種光榮的神聖的鬥爭，還未脫離危險的時期，不，正因爲我們這種鬥爭取得了全民族的以至全世界的重大的急義，而×人已經動員了所有代表反動的黑暗的腐敗的罪惡的勢力準備最後的反攻，因此，我們正臨到生死存亡的最後關頭，我們將臨到更嚴重更艱險更黑暗的時期；而特別值得我們警覺的，所有二十年前已爲我們當做進攻目標的外國侵喀者，尤其是日本侵略者所奴役的觀日派，漢奸，賣國賊，腐敗落伍者，頑固的守舊份子，他們已經在汪精衞的「反共和平」的理論幌子之下，任德意優略集團「反共集團」的幌孑之下，不僅勾結得更緊密，而且已經玩弄其爲侵略者所杜撰的法西斯的反民主的一套武器，以大逞其煽亂誘惑欺騙的技倆，而向我們開始形形式式的總攻了！</p>
<p>逆流是會在我們廣大強壯的民族統一戰線的抵抗之下最後消滅的，但是我們要在這裏特別提出新階段的靑年運動問題，我們要特別認淸新階段的靑年運動，亦就是發揚廿年前「五四」青年運動之精神的問題。這個問題的主要內容，首先是要發揚五四靑年運動中狂飚怒濤般的救國運動，一面發動廣大靑年起來參加民族建國事業，特別是增加　　　　　　　　　　，一面加緊推進民衆宣傳運動，以五四當時靑年大衆深入民間的精神，去廣泛地動員全民族的生動力量。其坎是更要發揚五四靑年運動中狂飆怒濤般的反漢奸反賣國賊運動，從一切方面，用一切方法，去和目前一切漢奸，傀儡賣國賊，僞組織進行，　　　　，特別是和汪派主持的「反共和平」的漢奸……理論作堅韌的靠山。我們要把反對漢奸理論與行動的鬥爭論作今後青年的中心任務。第三，是要發揚五四靑年運動中反封建反專制和提倡民主提倡科學的精神，推進保證中華民族解放勝利的新啓蒙運動。主要的任務（一）是要遵照中山先生遺訓，爭取靑年男女學生的參政，保障靑年運動的發展；（二）是要遵照蔣委員長的訓示，爭取保障敎育的全面的實施，失學失業靑年，救濟，組織，訓練，和大批黨員幹部的訓練與擢用。（三）要擴大掃除全國文盲的運動，特別是擴大戰區，×後，後方各地和華僑各界的戰時文化運動；（四）是要加緊與國際取得更密切的聯繫，爭取反法西斯反侵略陣線的鞏固擴大與成功。</p>
<p>新階段靑年運動的主要任務，我們謹在此處提出上述幾點，作爲目前全年界最低限度要實踐的工作綱領，而如何確立自由制度，如何發展學習與工作的競賽，如何以進行爭取自由與參政的工作，如何充實與擴大靑年界的民族統一戰線，然要當作日常工作，適應各地環境，堅决勇敢地推進。</p>

<h3>刧後貴陽</h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>【貴陽特約通訊】淸晨九點鐘，再跳上動務部的汽車，去貴陽。沿途皆高山峻嶺，車子起來跳躍得非常利害，十二時到了貴陽。從城外到遠東旅館的這一段街道尚稱繁華。二月四日×機狂炸貴陽市區之後，這也是僅存的一段命脈了。据當地平民社的統計，被災者共四十二條街道，毀屋千三百餘戶，災民達一萬三千四百餘人，其情况之慘，可想而見矣。</p>
<p>因爲貴陽是目前西南的交通中心：公路東可直至湘西之成德、長沙。南可抵廣西之桂林，西通雲南而抵昆明，西北出擊節，北上可到四川之貴州，南下則可經雲南之宣威轉昆明。從貴州北上則，黔川公路直達重慶。故貴陽雖然剛經浩刧，可是至今依然有人滿之患。街道上，酒館裏，以至每一個大小客棧，莫不瀣得滿滿地水洩不通，生活程度之高，誠出人意料，吃一頓客飯至少須大洋七毫。衛生褲衛生衫皆須三四元一件，普通皮鞋標價二十五塊，猪肉每元僅兩斤多，……正如遠東旅館裏的小茶房對我所說：「貴陽已爲貴洋了！」開口非大洋不行，鄕村的生活程度和昂市比較，幾乎相差十倍，這種畸形懸殊的現欽，的確是須要糾正的。長期抗戰中的經濟戰術也應該要和軍事行動「配合起來，我們不能集中兵力於一點，予×人以擊破主力的機會，故建設農村，把資本分散到西鄉去」，該是第二時期中經濟戰的應有步驟。</p>
<p>炸後的當地報紙，尚存中央日報和革命日報，重慶的大公日報，新華日報，掃蕩日報等亦皆隔日可到，書店則有生活，世界，自力，軍學……。其中生意最好每大擠滿着人的，大概爲世界書局和生活書店，後者每天的營業時間僅爲從下午二時至七時之間的五個鐘頭。據說在這五小時裏，平均她們可做到兩百元的買賣。其中以雜誌的銷路爲最好。</p>
<p>三八節義賣運動在貴陽的情况並不甚佳，銅鐵台傍固有許多要人的太太在那甲指手劃脚地演講，大夏大學的女生也在做塲團義賣，中央日報，革命日報……亦皆組織了義賣隊。可是其結果却不到四千元。若以十四萬市民每人平均出五分錢的話，亦當有七千元的數目，而何况目前人口較前增多，並且來者皆爲有錢階級，其結果如此，我們不可否認地說貴陽的氣氛還遠不像一個抗戰的後方，在另一面，京戲院的票價極貴（連捐一元七毫大洋一張票），可是夜夜皆鬧人滿，並且還聽說如果你不先吿訴賣票員什麽來頭的話，要想買多一張好位置的票子，那眞難似上靑天。</p>
<p>至省府訪問輯五委員，据說從民國廿四年中央軍進貴州後，一切皆已很快地進步。吳鼎昌主黔以來，因他人事關係好，金融上有辦法，故許多設施皆能依照計劃實行、目，行政的中心工作大槪不外徵兵，健强地方政治，開發實業三項，貴州地廳，本有錢出錢，有力出力原則，故對於徵兵特別注意，現在平均每月入伍的壯丁當在七八千人，而地方政治正在改善中，此後成績將會很快地進步。</p>
<p>礦務局，農業局，合作金庫等機構成立以來，對于貴州省的實業頗為改善，銅仁，省溪之水銀，遵義，安順，平越等地之煤，淸溪之鐵，……亦皆在從事開發。</p>
<p>最有趣的，前年因老百姓的桐油迷輸困難，沒有銷路，故人民十分懊喪，後來政府替他們設法交通關係，將本省所產桐油盡量推銷，結果人民大爲歡喜，現在竟成爲桐油比菜油貴，桐子比桐油貴的形勢，因爲大家皆收買桐子，努力種桐的緣故。</p>
<p>交通大學唐山工程學院現在平越，大夏大學和貴州醫學院皆在本市，此外各地的文化人，知識份子，技術人材來貴陽者很多，故政府趁此機會開辦地方行政人員訓練班，和保甲長人員訓練班，收集各方面的才智之士，以加强地方政治機構構效率。自然這多是十分切實而可卽見成果的創舉。</p>
<p>最後，我們談到蠻夷問題，他以爲這决不像一般人所說的民族問題，而祇是敎育問題吧了，因爲從實際情形看，漢苗在貴州原像一家人，根本沒有什麽政治與經濟上的利害不一致。坦白壇講苗人的文化程度，政治的水準，都還沒有到提出政治主張和某種建議的地步。故我們目前的重要工作是怎樣敎育，啓蒙和改善他們的生活就是了。</p>
<p>俗語說「貴州天無三日晴」，記者居貴州二星期，却天天雲開見日，氣候淸朗，恐怕天時亦因時代而變異了。因為天晴。所以空襲的活懼，常威脅着人們的心，驚弓之鳥，原是脆弱而不奪的。（救亡社約）</p>

<h3>德軍集波邊　形勢愈趨嚴重　波草反要求態度堅决　德外長將赴羅馬會商</h3>
<p>【路透社柏林三日電】此間頃宣佈、德外長里賓特羅甫將於明晚離此赴意、作數日之逗留、渠將訪晤意外相齊亞諾外國政界方面相信、德、意擬商討採取共同聯合行動、以答覆「包圍集團、針間認爲、但澤及波蘭將爲里賓特羅甫與齊亞諾會談之主題、當波外長於五日在國會發表答覆希特勒之演說時、里賓特羅甫仍在羅馬、故對於决定軸心國家之反響、甚爲順利也、據悉波蘭在但澤之任何要求、必將遭受德國之嚴厲拒絕、莫索尼里亦允竭力支持德國云、</p>
<p>【美聯社羅馬二日電】據此間外交界幷木證實之謠言稱、莫索里尼曾勸吿希特、對波蘭糾紛須審愼處理、因意大利殊不願因但澤之事而捲入戰爭也、該謠言雖未言明、如但澤之爭釀成戰爭、意大利是否援德而戰、但外人觀眾方面認爲、意國人民實不願作如是想也、彼等以爲、如英國能守中立、而與法作戰最爲贊成、否則、寧願致力於解决國內生活日艱之問題、此間各報載巴黎電訊、謂法國頗望意大利能負責調解德、波糾紛、含意頗爲深長、而一般所見、意大利實無意令希特勒與波蘭發生眞止衝突也、</p>
<p>【海通社巴黎一日電】法國政界之注意、仍繼續集中於但澤問題、法國政論家大多認爲德波對於但澤之爭端、恐無協調之可能、據今午所得報吿、波政府已將其草擬之反要求、通知英國、其中要點如下、（一）波蘭保管但澤之主權、（二）波蘭統制但澤參議院、（三）由波軍佔領自由市、（四）波蘭統制但澤之重工業、「巴黎晚報」對於駐波德大使之展期返任一事、特別予以重視、法國駐波大使之訪柏克、亦具有重大之意義、般推測此舉似與柏克本月十五日訪法之事有關、其餘各晚報俱認爲、德波關係業已進入極端嚴重之階段、</p>

<p>【路透社柏林二日電】德報之攻擊波蘭、已愈見急激狂暴、類多集中兩點、（一）波蘭似乎忘却自身乃與一强國爲鄰、（二）自接受英國之保證後、未免過於傾信、「漢堡報外國版」載稱：「波蘭若開始作不與東普質士協調之宣傳者、則以情理而言、德國自應考慮與該受有危慮之省區設立不能破壞之連索」。據政界方面之觀察、在五月五日柏克發表演說之前、德國對德、波糾紛不致有積極之行動、蓋柏克之演說、將根據希特勒之宣言表明波蘭之立場故也、德波邊境來客談、該處各市鎭均見車隊雲集、但官方業已聲明、邊境向皆有重兵扼守、故幷無特別之軍事活動云、聞最近由波希米亞及摩拉維亞調囘之部隊、原應給假休息者、亦已調往波蘭邊境增防云、</p>
<p>【美聯社柏林二日電】德國報紙頃一致對德、波關係作激昂論調、政界人士相信、此乃爲德國對波壓力之開始、以便要求取囘但澤、另一方面則指此為故意示威於波外長、而澎響其星期五之演講、「公吿報」謂、英、法、挑唆波蘭參加包圍德國、</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>戲劇界大聯合</h3>
<p>全港戲劇界聯合大公演的「黃花崗」名劇，已於昨夕起在太平戲院上演，今明兩夕將繼續演出。</p>
<p>我們對於這次「黃花崗」名劇之演出，表示十二分的欣快與重視。主要的原因有以下幾點：</p>
<p>第一，「黃花崗」是偉大的革命歷史劇，是反映初明中華民族革命的意識形態的名劇，目前我們民族革命雖已進入嶄新的階段，而革命先烈所留給我們的經騅與敎訓，還是需要我們普遍的認眞的接受的。而如伺使這種史實與經驗敎訓普遍地具現地爲大衆所認識所了解所吸收，則是員前劇界的主要任務之一。「黃花崗」的演出，顯然有其先導的意義。</p>
<p>第二，這次演出，是由香港各界賑聯會所主辦，所得欵項、將全數撥作救濟陣亡將士遺羈基金，不僅在香港爲創舉，卽在國內以至海外各地，亦有其規模的意義。我們要知道日貨要爭取抗戰勝利，有賴於前綫戰鬥力的增強，固必，使將士的家屬生活，憂，俾能在前綫安心作戰；而未來建國成功，更有賴於廣大新生力量的培植，設立陣亡將士消屬之救濟基金，實培植未來新生力量的首要工作之一，亦當作爲目前僑界的重要任務。</p>
<p>但是特別重要的還是第三，卽此次公演，參加劇團共有三十多個，動員劇員達五百餘人，不僅在香港爲空前盛舉，卽在國內亦未之前見；尤其是表現了香港戲劇界的空前的大聯合，我們除了對於參加這次，聯合的劇員及劇團，於百尺竿頭，更進一步，使香港的戲劇界的統一戰綫更加鞏固與發展，使香港的戲劇文化運動有更進一步的發展。</p>

<h3>香港戲劇界空前的大貢獻　『黃花崗』昨晚公演</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>成績美滿情緒熱烈今明晚繼續演出</p>
<p>千呼萬喚的偉大革命史劇『黄花崗』終於昨晚在太平戲院献演於幾千個羣衆之前了。香港話劇界空前的團結，空前的努力，空前的貢献，亦就在昨晚創造了一個劃時期的紀錄了。這一頁光榮的史蹟不知竭盡了多少人的心思，流盡了多少人的血　，這裏應先向前後台及籌委會幾百位熱心的工作者謹致民族解的敬禮！</p>
<p>在這個熱然，緊張的場面之中，最有趣的是後台：</p>
<p>演員，工作人員，道具……把一個寬大的後台堵塞起來，在李景波，姜明，唐叔明幾位化裝能手佈　之卜，這個革命志士，那個滿淸老　，還有轎夫，淸兵，都一變本來面目了。她笑他的辮子像猪尾一樣。他笑她的鑲邊衣裙成個什麽標子！有的喃喃在背着台詞，有的手舞足蹈在練習台步，管佈景的，掣電光的，都是着了活潑的工裝，胼手胝足地忙個不了。「分工合作」與一事無大小」充分在實踐中表現出來，還有「大燈籠」「大龍旗」「肅靜迴避」的路牌……，好一套封建的古董，多可鄙的一些進　　沉下來的渣滓，傷心的國恥，</p>
<p>不由得不勾起無限的感慨！</p>
<p>舞台監督胡春冰先生是幾位最努力的領導者中的一位。他說：『半月來什麽事情都攔在一邊，幹的只有　　黃花崗公演一件事』。他的　色看來是很疲勞，精神却還是十分興奮。正與歐陽予倩先生一樣，這是他們精神所寄托的事業，這是他們生活的趣味。</p>
<p>歐陽先生說：『聯合公演眞够麻煩；實　做起事來，就可嘗到它的眞味道。』</p>
<p>巡禮了後台之後，就往劇場三層樓兜了一週，二樓最擁擠，三櫃多是歌詠員，大堂正座却仍有很多座位空着，可知道很多上層階級還是超然事外，什麽撫恤陣亡將士家屬，全都與他無關。這亦未始不是香港社會的一個剪影。</p>
<p>七時半洪　的歌聲超配合着號角，震動了整個會場。劉影氏指揮得格外生動，有力，因爲廿多個歌詠隊，幾百個歌詠員，亦　話劇一樣，空前聯合，空前的團結，第一支是國歌，全場肅立致歌，『五三一』『五四』『五五一是什麼日子，敏感的僑胞又是有動於中，第二友是『黄花崗歌』，『……』『誰忍永別父母與妻兒』『……』爲了民族的自由解放，誓將白骨長埋黄花崗』『……』『但願四萬萬五千萬同胞齊起來』『……『句句打動人們的心坎。接下去。還歌詠了很　救亡歌曲，深願親愛的　胞珍重熱烈的情緒，發動實際的工作。</p>
<p>八時正，『黄花崗』在熱烈掌聲中揭開序落了。</p>
<p>廣州東門外的佈景很迫眞，叫賣花生甘蔗的小販唯妙唯肖，先給觀衆一個饒有情趣的感覺，正面劇情一展開，可就十分激昂。十分嚴噸。</p>
<p>滿淸的醜熊使人齒冷。温生才行刺李準，結果彈盡被擒，死的不是李準，而是孚琦。『多殺一個漢奸，一個滿奴，中國就可以少一條害虫』的壯語引起全場熱烈的掌聲，温烈士從容就義的精神，是中華民族典型的愛國義士。</p>
<p>序幕過後。就是第一幕。佈景是革命黨的秘密機關，女同志熱烈地工作着，一些革命同志等待着黄克强到來。滿淸走狗雖然來搜了一遍，幸得敷衍過去。林覺民太太不遠千重前來探夫，爲了革命工作却以理智克服感情，避開而不予接見。</p>
<p>黄克强一來——敦飾——空氣突形緊張。不成功就是成仁的决心，感動了很多革命同志。但某些　搖份！却使人討厭。以古證今，團體之中，寄生着懦怯者，近視者，自私者是在多不免的。終有一天是他　滅的末日。</p>
<p>黄克强和他的愛人徐宗漢——區愛飾——談　愛的穿插使嚴肅的空氣暖和起來。但是，他們不是戀愛至上主義的戀愛，而是作爲革命助力的戀愛。這亦未始不是替靑年男女啓示一個正確的戀愛觀。</p>
<p>第二幕的佈景是兩廣總督衙門內洋花廳，裝墴十分華麗。張鳴歧——張織孫飾——衣現滿奴的臭架子很像樣。姜明飾僕人，雖英雄無用武之地』。但他的動作亦够使人發云了。張妾——都竹筠飾——向張的輕挑與嬌媚情態，亦把劇情活潑一下，這一幕所表現的，就是張嗚歧「正在奇怪着革命黨人爲什麽捉不盡，殺不消」所謂「野草燒不盡，春風吹又生」。</p>
<p>第三幕的地點是另個革命機關，時間是「三二九」的前夜。許多男女同志搬運着軍火，積極地籌備起義。「縱然這一次失敗了。對於一般民衆的影響是不可磨滅的」；「誰怕犧牲，誰就不配做一個革命者」：「我們要完成這一頁光榮的歷史」；「時機已到最後關頭，不成功，當成仁」。革命黨人互相勗勉，互相感化。擺在僑胞之前，是一個好榜樣。</p>
<p>第四幕是張鳴歧李準在總督署審訊革命黨員陳美新，饒國英的時候，革命黨攻進來，塲面非常緊張。張嗚岐李準倉呈逃走，狼狽情形，引起半場的冷笑，可是，我們因爲實力不足，七十二烈士壯烈犧牲了！但同時全國的革命火種亦更廣大地蔓延開了。</p>
<p>這失敗，是第十一次成功之母。尾聲的一幕，就是表現同年十月，日武昌起義的成功，中華民國建立起來了！七十二烈士在九泉之下微笑！</p>
<p>二十八後的「三二九」我們僑胞開黄花崗的紀念會。</p>
<p>「親愛的同胞，同志們，經過了二十二個月的民埃自衛抗戰，已經進展到一個　嚴中的新階段了，要加速的爭取抗戰最後勝利，只有竭盡自己的能力。澈底完成黄花崗七十二烈士和　理交付給我們的使命！新的中國就要新生了。黄花崗烈士的精神不死！中華民族萬歲！中華民國萬歲！</p>
<p>正止　夜十二時，在極度緊張情　中，在千百個觀衆的如雷掌聲中閉幕。今晚，明晚，再欣賞最進步的戲劇藝術，接受革命的洗禮去吧！這是一個太難得的機會了。</p>

<h3>發刊辭</h3>
<p>— 何秋</p>
<p>人壽保險事業在中國僅有五十餘年之歷史，最初爲外國公司來華設立之分公司，招攬華人牛意，每年漏巵實屬不資，迨民國元年始有華人自己組織之公司，時因民智未開，一時未能引起社會人士之注意，經十餘年後，復有國人自辦之公司設立，直至最近七八年間，又有數家相繼興辦，但其數亦不過十家，以與美國之三百家比較，實有天壤之別，現且不免因戰事之影響，而受相當挫折。</p>
<p>人壽保險之目的爲預防吾人如遇有不測，用以保障身後家庭之生計，使無凍餒之憂；蓋人生斯世，危險萬端，隨時隨地均有發生可能，際茲多事之秋，尤爲顯著，苟不早爲之備，將有噬臍之悔，是故平時要保壽險，戰時更要保壽險，愛家之人要保壽險，愛國之人更要向華資公司投保壽險，藉以挽囘利權，蓋壽險公司集合保戶所繳些微保費，積成鉅額，以之投資各種事業，開發國家富源，國富利民，實利賴之，此即本刊編印之動機也。</p>
<p>本刊辱承海內外各界惠賜佳章，良深感激，只因限于篇幅，未能悉于首期登出，實不勝抱歉之至，本刊籌備時間，極其短促，匆惶付印，漏誤之處，在所難免，尙望讀者加以指正，則幸甚耳。</p>
<h3>壽險事業與國民經濟建設</h3>
<p>— 王蘊玉</p>
<p>一，人壽保險之意義</p>
<p>人壽保險者，乃籌身後家庭生活費用最妥善之方法，蓋吾人大半均賴家主一人日常之收入，以維持家庭之生計，倘家主無恙，收入不變，則一家之人，猶可優優卒歲，不致凍餒，然若家主一日遭遇不測，則一家之人，將失所依，身後簫條，自不待言。是則一所謂家無担石之蓄，小女嗷嗷待哺云云」者，皆不保險有以致之也。然人壽保險之爲用，非保人之不死。乃保人于死之後。其家庭得向壽險公司領取保險金額以維持生計。使不至陷于　餒。故人　保險者。乃本人類互助之精神。聯合同種危險之人。而分担其間所生之經濟損失也。</p>
<p>二，險壽與國民經濟建設</p>
<p>壽險對于家庭之功用，爲壽險最大的目的，此凡稍有常識者，莫不知之。但就國民經濟方面言之，其裨益尤屬至巨。茲畢其犖犖大者分述于次：</p>
<p>（一）能鼓勵儲蓄夫資本之積聚，須賴多數國民之節　儲蓄，鼓勵國民節約儲蓄之方法甚多，但人壽保險實爲其中最有效之一法。普通　蓄大致係任　主義，而壽險儲蓄則含有强制之性質，故壽險事業之能歧勵國民節約儲蓄，其程度實過于其他一　方　之上，苟一國之人民多歡保有壽險，則其儲蓄者必多，儲蓄多則國民之資本，可以集中。由消極方而言之，足使投保者心神安定，而無後顧之憂，勇往直前，養成國民進取之氣象；由積極方面言之，更能增加個人對于針食之信用，而趨於均富之道。</p>
<p>（二）能安定企業，在合夥商店中，每因一合夥之死亡而迫于解散，卽在公司組織中，亦常有因重要職員之死亡而蒙受影響者，此皆不保險之弊也。若合夥保有壽險。則合夥　有死亡，則其他生存合夥可向壽險公司領取保金，使該合夥商店轉危爲安。公司之重要職員如經理，工程師等關係一間公司至大，自應為之保險以防意外之損失，蒼保險之後，使此等重要職員而仍存在，固爲公司之福，不幸而死亡，則公司得享有巨額之保金，以偵所失。</p>
<p>此外如信用　著之職員，常　公司借軟或發行債券之無形祖保者，則其存亡，亦與公司有莫大之關係，若公司有爲之保險或於發行債劵之時，卽爲保險，則其對於公司之信用，自必益堅。又如銀根奇緊之時，公司乏款，商借困難，影響公司，亦屬至大，然使公司之重要職員事前保有壽險，則公司卽可利用此種保單，向壽險公司抵押借款，自不致有週轉不靈之虞。公司職員保有壽險，尤能使其安心榮業，不致見異思遷，此非特職員自身之利，亦爲公司之益，蓋勞　糾紛亦得隨之而解决也。誠如是，則企業安定，其裨益于國民經濟，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>（三）能　殖國富壽險事業發達，卽是國民投保壽險者愈多，于是保險公司收集保戶所繳微小保費，集腋成裘，積成鉅額資金，以之開發國家富源，投資實業，發展國民經濟，國富利民，實利賴之。据一九二六年底美國五十二家壽險公司中共有資產一一，八七六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兀，投資于抵押放款者，爲五，〇八三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，投資于債券股票者，爲四，五三六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，其他放款爲二，二五七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。司知美國國民經濟之如斯發達，共得力于壽險公司之投資，實至大也。</p>
<p>（四）能補助財政　壽險公司吸收保戶保費，因其滿期年限恆爲長期性質，如十年·二十年·或三十年不等，故對于保壽準備金，常可作長期之投資，對于中央及地方政府所發行之公債，不論平時戰時，均能大量吸受。如日俄戰爭及歐洲大戰，日本與各國所發行之公債，認講　多者，厥爲保險公司。由此可見壽險公司所吸收之資金，其裨益于國　經濟與補助國家財政，實足與銀行業相提並論</p>
<p>（五）能强健民族凡投保壽險，必須檢驗體格，而人之疾病，往往有潛滋暗長，苦於不自知者。旣經檢驗，則自無不講求攝生，以保衞壽命，久而久之，相習成風，民族之强健，卽基于此。勞力爲生產要素之最要者，而民族　康實爲勞力之本，故欲國民經濟之發展，則强健民族，自屬至要。</p>
<p>三　結論</p>
<p>人壽保險事業與國民經濟建設關係之密切，在歐美各國，風行已久，早着成績。不過此種制度在中國僅有五十餘年之歷史，且因民智未開，提倡不力，進步珠甚遲緩，際此國難時期，首重經濟建設，壽險事業爲經濟建設之一端，亟宜加以提倡，蓋在個人方面，因戰時危險較大，對于保險上需要更切，而在政府方面，若以目前之經濟狀况觀之，則因戰費浩大，欲言建設，除借外債而外，尤有賴于國民之節約儲蓄，而保險實爲儲蓄最有效之方法也。關於國民經濟建設與節約之辦法，在蔣委員長所提倡之國民經濟建設運動及新生活運動，均有詳細之規定；最近中央政府對此，又復三令五申，茲不贅述。斯篇僅就人壽保險一層略加發揮耳。</p>
<h3>暑天流行病之預防法</h3>
<p>— 張紹動</p>
<p>暑天之流行症甚多，其原因多由口而入，蓋當夏季，天時酷熱，大多愛食生冷之食物及未沸過之水，以致產生各種疾病；本港每年由此種疾病傳染而死者，不可勝數。茲特略舉數種暑天普通流行病症之原因及其預防法及治療法于次，俾閱者知所謹愼焉。</p>
<p>一　熱膓症</p>
<p>原因，此症由於一種細菌而來，其傳染多因欣用混有本病患者大小便之水，或因使用其洗滌其大小便之河水，或因着用患者水消毒之衣服或由蒼蠅傳　而來者。</p>
<p>症狀，初起全身倦怠，食思不振，嫌忌就業，頭痛，不眠，初起　寒，繼而發然，第一星期體温徐呈階段狀，昇　　於華氏一〇二度，第二星期則熱度達於極點、常稽留於一〇四度左右，第三星期帶輕度之弛張性，似漸下降，至第四星期她張著明，而熱退。</p>
<p>脉搏對於熱度較爲徐緩</p>
<p>舌則被有灰白色之厚苔及乾燥</p>
<p>糞便在發病之初多秘結</p>
<p>本症之併發爲腸出血，腸穿孔，多發於第三週。</p>
<p>治療法，平臥安靜，忌食固形食物，與以牛奶湯等，而醫生則對症發　。</p>
<p>防預去，可打防預針，每星期一次，共打三次，可預防大約至九月之久。</p>
<p>二　霍亂</p>
<p>原因，由於一細菌侵入消化器而發，其傳染原因，爲不潔之飮食物及襯衣。</p>
<p>症狀，起時腹部緊扼，有便意，排出之便。稀薄如液，口渴，腓腸筋壓痛，四肢厥冷。</p>
<p>本症往往一二日後致死，然亦有轉入反應期。吐瀉漸减。治療法，平臥安靜，食物惟用流動物，治法多用鹽水注射血管，</p>
<p>預防法，可打霍亂預防針。</p>
<p>三　赤痢</p>
<p>原因，係由赤痢菌，而起，在熱帶地方，有由於一種阿米巴而起者謂之赤痢性阿米巴，食未熟之果物及一切飲食不攝生，則易發本病，</p>
<p>症狀，便通頻煩，裏急後重，兼以腹痛及腹嗚，每次排泄之便，其量少，而含有粘液血液，</p>
<p>本病之併發症爲肝臟膿瘍，後發症之重要爲腸管狹窄</p>
<p>治療法，平臥安靜若赤痢菌赤痢則多注射馬漿可望早痊愈，若阿米巴赤痢，則注射阿馬田二次可愈。</p>
<p>以上爲暑天最流行及易傳染之疾病，至於其他疴嘔病症尙多，最要者，在暑天食物，必甚謹愼，未經煮熟之食物切不可入口，未沸過之水不可飮，及凡食品必須以節　之，以免蒼蠅之傳染。</p>

<h3>昨籃球大戰　甲組星島挫東方　乙組春草培英獲勝</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）昨晚靑年會健身室裏、擠滿肴男男女女、端的熱閙、而一般人的目的、在於觀看星島對東方熱幕甲組籃球賽、因爲此賽關係錦標前途甚大、所以特別惹人注自、</p>
<p>首場乙組春草對太古、演出頗多噱頭、場面遼不錯、畢竟春草聯絡較好、常佔優勢、乃以四十八比卅一奪得勝利、</p>
<p>次　甲組星島對東方，乃爲觀衆最重視的一幕、雙方以勝負關係重要、演來都併命、戰情緊奏、扣人心弦、</p>
<p>星島各員、都係健身室的「出產品」、步驟純熱、聯絡得宜、籃底一擊尤兇、故能始終佔先、卒將東方擊敗、</p>
<p>星島致　的原因、純在聯絡有方、射籃準確、各人定的位置、旣快捷、又能互相呼應、所以常收籃底投中之效</p>
<p>東方各個的技術、固屬良好、惟全隊合作功夫很差、在中場運球、尙稱得體、一到了籃底、便束手無策、雖素以擅投籃底球見稱於時的徐亨、因深入時所得供應不靈、乃沒法施其技、簡直說、東方所得籃底球、少之又少、</p>
<p>還有各人跑位時、太過重視釘人、忽略了乘空的一擊、雖然常有深入的機會、俱都欠缺靈巧的動作、乃失諸交臂、那得球轉身卽投的妙技、全場　不得一見、此點雖因星島防衛嚴密、致難施展、然其找機　的能力、確島脆弱、則爲場衆共見之事</p>
<p>全隊中以馮念華得分獨多、的是猛將、名不虛傳、他又工心計、最善巧取罰分、而其此舉動作、很易杷場衆瞞過、因他得球到手、一見有空隙、　運球衝進、在對方守者、見他衝來、未有不出面攔截的、可是那守者一出攔赦、便不免中計、易遭侵入犯規之處罰、試看續分表中、馮所得　分獨多，就是施用此計的成攻、</p>
<p>但、籃球競賽的勝利，並不全靠個人的功夫、乃靠全隊的合作、　氏個人技術雖好，惟全隊聯絡不及星島妙美、故不得不敗、總比數四十比四十七，</p>
<p>尾場乙組培英對南華、培英進展迅速、造成機會甚多、其中以黄耀華、關振斌、陳錫養等最活躍、遂以州二比廿二壓倒南華、茲把單甲組一塲成績列下</p>

<h3>今日草地網球　雙打準決賽　何家鎏李汝榮對林珍兄弟</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）公開草地網球賽、今日下午四時半、有雙打　决賽一場在香港木球會場舉行、由何家流孚汝榮對林珍兄弟、何氏為網球界宿將、富有經騐、近來更刻苦練習、球藝漸復舊觀、氣力亦頗充沛、故在是屆競賽中、常有良好之貢　、與李氏合作雙打以來、所向皆捷、獲得準决　權、固非倖而致之、今日出戰林珍兄弟、若其得勝、便獲决　權、他日與徐氏兄弟作爭標戰、失敗則失局、前功亦盡棄　、故處此嚴重關頭、何李二人誓必力爭、惟能否得勝、殊未可料、蓋因林珍弟兄、爲雙打之翹楚、技術不凡、刻下捨徐氏兄弟足以制其死命外、尙無出其右者、雖何李二人已下决勝之心、以大敵當前而益目勉勵、冀於努力之下、得收良效、但以技術　論、林珍兄弟實勝一籌、合作亦較佳、故記者認爲何李二人欲圖勝利、誠不容易、然吾人固甚望　能如願以償、完成華人包辦雙打冠亞兩軍之偉舉、但過於理想之事、未必得以實現、今日遇此勁數、實凶多吉少、若然難關度過、殊可賀也、（東郎）</p>
<h3>澳門足球聯隊　週末來港戰東方　江善敬仍為東方效力</h3>

<p>此隊實力充沛、而前鋒之吿喇素、尤具有優越工夫、在埠際賽中任中堅職、此次出任右輔、當予東方以威脅也、至東方現在雖因曹秋亭、許文奎、苗華國已返滬、及侯澄滔赴菲未返、然人材尙不感缺乏、實力猶强、屆時應戰之　容、刻尙未正式排定、但江善敬决爲東方效勞、自將多人、俱自吿奮勇、明後日卽可將正式陣線公布也、又據澳門總會來函、該隊準搭星期日晨早西安輪來港、約於午刻（十一時十五分）到步、東方已决派員迎迓、以盡賓主之　云</p>

<p>— 黄繩</p>
<p>靑年是中國新生的動力。</p>
<p>三千四百九十萬方里的大地，當它沉寂得像一個死海。千百萬衆呻吟在壓迫和殘審下的時候，靑年以無後顧的精神，揚起一個汹湧的波瀾，海燕似的飛翔着。向人民大衆指示了光明的出路；當它燃起了革命的烽火，經騐着一個惡鬥的時候。靑年又以最偉大的力量，堅起一面戰鬥的大旗，便作爲一個號手，爲半殖民地的奴隷們響着進軍的角號。</p>
<p>靑年是中國新生的動力，中國近代歷史上的每一個偉大的政治運動，文化運動，思想運動，靑年都奉献了力量，盡了發　，領導，支持的艱鉅的任務；每一個運動的歷史，都溶和着靑年的吶喊，靑年的精神，靑年的血。靑年可以自聚的地方正多。</p>
<p>五四運動開始了一個中國文化的新生，而靑年們對賣國賊的一擊，却是日出時直透壹層的第一條光綫，五卅運動揭開了中國大革命的序幕，靑年以大規模的示威運動，以鮮紅的血液，充實了圈點了這運動的光榮的歷史。一九二六——二七年的大革命，在中國原野　滾動着最激烈的火流。靑年成了軍隊的堅强幹部，成了民衆運動的急先鋒，開始了切實的眞正革命的實踐。一九三五年的一二九，靑年配合着全國大團結的孕育情勢，髙揚着學生運動的精神，捱着水龍皮鞭鐵尺，要喚起人民大衆舖築到統一戰綫去的大道。八一三後，靑年担當着怎樣重大的任務，創造了多少令人驚異的成績，所謂事實具在，也無需花費叙述的筆墨，這股中國新生的動力，將以最浩蕩的激流，最壯美的波瀾，冲毀了一切骯臟和　阻，建立比以前一切都更要偉大的功蹟。</p>
<p>今天靑年節，中國的年靑的一代，要珍視自己的歷史，要虔誠地接受最高當局和最髙領袖的囑咐，全國民衆和國除友人的企望，更廣大的更着實的開展工作，完成戰鬥的任務。</p>
<p>我們的年靑的一代，不能有絲亳的自滿的心理，要承認自己的成績還未盡　盡美，而日要我們去做的工作是無限的多，現在還祇是一個開頭。前途的棘荊需要我們斬伐，無數的困難將給我我們以無情的試　。——靑年戰鬥有着一個最最艱苦的歷程。</p>
<p>我們要時刻反省，我們工作，有沒有一定的計劃和步驟，追求着最髙的效率；是不是變了終日奔奔波波，却一事無成，完全荒疏了學養，甚至當天的報紙也沒有看的「事務主義者」；受了整天開會。祇是擬章程吃茶點的新的「華威先生」？</p>
<p>我們要時刻反省，我們有沒有排除了小資產階級的浮躁性妬忌心領袖慾；是不是受了開口就說自己過去怎樣怎樣，眩　着自己的才能的「張振華型」的人物；變了希求什麽職位，把圑體的領導權搶了過去，失敗了便閙意氣的「吳大雄型」的傢伙。</p>
<p>還有，要時刻反省的是，我們有沒有犯着左傾幼稚病，有沒有飮了英雄主義的毒，有沒有沉迷於什麽羅曼斯，忘記了工作的使命，忘記了時代的艱苦。……這些，這些，都是我們靑年應取以勉人幷以自勉的。</p>
<p>靑年是中國新生的動力，靑年要成爲一個堅忍的鬥士！</p>
<h3>孔云亭與盧梭</h3>
<p>— 窮夫</p>
<p>——展卷有益錄</p>
<p>孔云亭在「桃花扇」底前記裏面叙述他這　劇本的流傳的經過，有這樣兩條：</p>
<p>「桃花扇」本成，王公薦紳莫不借鈔，時有紙貴之勞，乙夘夕，內侍素『桃花扇』甚急，予之繕本，忘懷遺傳何所，乃於張平州中丞蒙覓得一本，午夜進之直邸，遂入內府。</p>
<p>突辰四月，予已解組，木庵先生招觀「桃花扇」一時翰部臺省羣公咸集，讓予獨居上座，命諸伶更番進觴。邀予品題，座客嘖嘖指顧，頗有陵雲之氣。</p>
<p>這一看就知道作者是在引爲榮耀的，但這　細想不得。「桃花扇」是「以抒寫「明朝亡國之痛爲主旨」的，而作者却以得到淸朝皇帝底垂顧和淸朝王公大人底捧場得意，眞　人想不通是怎麽一囘事。難道眞的證實了我們一些「學者」底主張，所謂作品和作者底人格竟一點都不相關嗎？</p>
<p>但是也隨牠，就讓那些『學者』去髙興好了。不過我却因爲這個想起了曾經被我們「學者」所痛罵過的一位法國底古人</p>
<p>盧梭在他底『懺悔錄』第八卷中叙述到他底歌劇「Le　devin　viliage」上演時的情形，眞有點和孔云亭所得意的　面相像。他說他以作者的身分也坐在一間包廂裏面，就在他對面却坐若皇帝·皇后，所有宮庭中的人物，而他是鬍子也不剃，衣服也不換。就那樣髙坐在那兒，靜聆若四圍那些貴族太太們底讃賞，品　，　哩咕魯。他又釵述到上演後的情形，却比較孔云亭所得意的更要值得羨慕。他說一到了第二天，皇帝就要召見他，還要觀自賜給他年金。</p>
<p>大家都知盧梭是皇帝和貴族的死敵，就是在當時算是成功了的那個劇本，固然現在已經公認是不髙明的作品了，但那內容却還是抒寫平民　情感，在發揮着他底主張的。但也把皇帝和貴族對他要好的情形那樣叙述出來，却好像表明他自己在引爲熒耀。這分明和孔云亭一樣，也是自己在打着自己的耳光。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，我們底『學者』痛罵盧梭，實在是不應該的。盧梭也不是帮着證明了睹位底主張了嗎？</p>
<p>但是奠忙。盧梭雖然叙述了他和皇帝，和貴族坐在一起，可是他所得意的却是他的毫不修飾，以平民的服裝，和皇帝和貴埃坐在一起的這一點上。接着他遠大大地發揮了一下不剃鬻子，不換衣服的道理，意思是：我看我的戲，管他媽的去。雖然也叙述了皇帝要見他，但卽刻就說他不要見皇帝，而且還用諷刺的筆　說了一些他不要見皇帝的理由。盧梭畢竟有些「煞風景」，終於不能像我們底孔云亭，所以結果只落得一個毫不得意。</p>
<p>到頭是中國有的，外國實在未必有，盧梭就是不凑趣的一個。我現在纔明白我們底「學者」要痛罵他的原因了。</p>
<p>但是莫忙。你倘是讀過從前找們底一位『學者』介紹「懺悔錄」的大著，讀到關於上面說的那兩段時，却都叫你不能不爲之愕然。盧梭和皇帝，和貴族坐在一起，是被介紹了；可是盧梭發揮他看不起上流裝束的一大堆話，卻　全被逐出了一化外」，不見一點影子。皇帝要見盧梭，也介紹了；可是盧梭說他不要見皇　的那種諷刺的文字，却被改　面目地意譯了兩句完事。原來我們這位「學者」硬要使盧梭和我們歷史上的文學作家一模一樣。這工作算是做成功了，只是那般痛罵盧梭的『學者』又好像沒有看見這個大著，可惜，可惜。</p>
<h3>慶祝靑年節的意義</h3>
<p>— 李政耀　謝裕德</p>
<p>誰都知道，在民族解放運動史中，「五四」是　中最光榮　英勇的一頁。它是一九二五——二七年，中國大革命的序幕，是中國學生參加政治活動，負起反×反對建兩大任務的起始。這一偉大運動距今已二十年了，在此二十年中，中國畢生在孤立無緩的環境下，用他們底血和肉，在民埃解放鬥爭中前造了不少奇績，今後，他們將以更英勇的姿態，完成其抗戰建國的偉大時代的使命。</p>
<p>在抗戰進入了第二期，最後勝利行將來臨的目前，我們紀念五四更有重大的意義。尤使我們興奮的是中央公佈五四爲中國靑年節日，無　的這是表示了中國學生運動在其不斷的努力奮鬥下，已獲得祖國政府底同情與援助了，今後的中國畢生運動，將更有其光榮遠大的前途。</p>
<p>我們香港同學，將以克服過去缺點，加强今後工作來慶祝偉大的靑年節！來維護二十年來先進同學們英勇奮鬥得來的成果！</p>
<p>在我們還沒有指出我們今後總的努力方向以前，讓我門對過去的香港學運，作一簡單的檢討：</p>
<p>香港同學也和國內同學一般，有其優良的傳統，他不們畏艱辛，不畏沉悶，在沙漠般的香港，散憐抗×救亡的種子，他們以艱苦沉毅的工作精神去　取社會的同情。他們更能够緊緊的把握住客觀形勢的迫切要求，進行各種各樣的工作，給予祖國以物力和人力的援助。無可否認的，在過去香港學運上，也有許多缺點：</p>
<p>（一）沒有堅强下層基襯（校內組繳）。這主要的是由于過去香港學運弱所脆使然。因爲這一缺點的存在，致使學運工作，至今還朱能深入校內廣大的學生羣去。我們今後只有加緊開展校內組織，動員廣大同學參加工作，才能支持與擴大香港的學生運動。</p>
<p>（二）工作方式過於前進。不同的對象，不同的環境，應用不同的工作方式。香港的工作同學却沒有注意到這一點。他們進行工作　，老是照模照樣的日着國內的工作方式，什麽宣傳啦，組　啦，時事座談會啦，一般同學看來，都是枯燥無味的一大串，結果給圑結了的只是一小部份較前進的同學，而其他廣大同學，仍然遠離着救亡的的陣營。</p>
<p>（三）工作沒有與同學們底生活密切聯系起來。許多同學感到學校功課過於繁重，許多同學感到生活枯燥，同時更有許多同學感到許多切身問題，如讀書，戀愛，經濟等問題的沒劍法解决，然而，我們香港的同學，在工作時却沒有把握住這些迫切的要求，反而提出什慶大時代靑年應有的實任等一類的空洞口號。當然，結果也不會引起滿懷苦悶的同學底注意。</p>
<p>（四）工作沒有爭取敎師底同情與領導。過去香港同學雖然不時提出『師生合作，共赴國難』的口號，可是事實上進行工作時很少有過虛心的要求師長們對工作的指示與援助，師長們底經驗比我們豐富，目光比我們遠大，我們底工作正需要先進師長們底指示與督促，要是我們一切工作也通過　長的關係，無疑的，在工作上是會減少了許多困難。</p>

<h3>第一次出動</h3>
<p>— 任林瑞</p>
<p>初秋，天氣還是很熱，大地培養長大的棉花，吧白的花，早被當地的農人摘去，當作他們極値得重視的一年之中辛勞的酧報，祇剩下枯枝。又雜的遍布在這荒凉的田野。</p>
<p>沒有山，然而印有着土堆的墳墩，它凸出在田野裏好像爲大田管理一切。</p>
<p>不寬闊的小河却有好幾條，它可以引渡你到此地著名的唐家祠堂，它可以引渡你到岸傍，廣大陰暗深綠的竹林中去。現在白天，時常在這裏可以看駐防着的士兵。他們會向你招手，駕着尖頭的小船很輕鬆的划着單櫓。</p>
<p>公立第二傷兵　院是設在鄉下的一個公立小學校里，裏邊也有從上海紅十宇會派去救護隊在服務，醫院中極靜，傷兵所蓋的被得大都是老百姓所親自送來的。</p>
<p>我們時常到這醫院去，因爲童子軍也要做救護工作的。抬傷兵的時候，路很難走，全要從田地間狹小的道旁走過，但是我們走不慣，於是終沿霄小河的岸旁走。小河是美麗的，小河是我們的指南針。</p>
<p>田野里祇有公立醫院附近有二十多間鄉　，都是古老陳舊的，這是此地唯一的房舍了，我們有幾位同志是往那邊。</p>
<p>晚，已經顯得很凉，月亮照在用野上，望過去，燈火，都沒有一點，祇有月亮的銀灰色，籠罩這田野。</p>
<p>我和老　——他年歳比我大，個子也比我高；一同去站崗，他帶着步槍，還背了蔑排的子彈。</p>
<p>雖然覺得有點凉意，但是這種　使是我們願意接受的，我們周巡着田野。</p>
<p>前面有兩個壯丁，答覆了我們——當日的口令，馬上就急忙的跑過來，吿訴我們，前面墳墩後面好像有人在放信號，綠的焰先，很快的朝天空放。</p>
<p>我就從老顧手中採來槍枝，很快的左右四人分散包圍這具有危險性的墳墩，我心中有點躊躇，有點害怕，然而捉人呵，我踏着靑草，很快的兜了過去。</p>
<p>『沒有』，我們跑了兩個圈子，遭遇着的時候，都發出同樣的奇　。</p>
<p>打發壯了走後，我們帶着警戒的心，躱避在附近，搶頭描着　才的墳頭。</p>
<p>凉夜的沈寂的，這裏祇有我們兩人的呼吸。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>『這回你够本啦呢？』</p>
<p>她飽起兩腮，看着他，默然不語。</p>
<p>『你還想讓我給你買報　？』</p>
<p>『我也不讓你買啦！』</p>
<p>他終于達到了目的。</p>
<p>從此，她拖延着那種稚氣，不和他說話了；正像每個人童年常有的一種矜持。他幾次來看她，尋找說話的機會；她却不理他，而且，故意地裝做着一種違反心理的表情和動作。以示給對方的不滿和報復。對方不是一個孩子，他了解那些：所以他不但不生氣，而且喜悅——他那種變態的表現，正是證明她心理的常態——表不她把自己忘於暫有變境以外。</p>
<p>正是這時候，發生了一件慣常發生的事情，有兩個醉後的日本兵，搖襬着斜的肢體，由於兩脚失去了重心而拋着不準確的步子，走進這樓房，在樓上的過道上，他們兩人相挽地走起來，彷彿飯後走上無人的曠野，揀了一條寂靜的小路。消化着食物，並且，嘴里哼着聽不淸的淫亂的調子。有時，他們隨便地踢開門，同門內的主人咆哮一陣，又哈哈大笑地關了鬥。因此，所有的門，都被各家的主人館閉，以無限度的容忍，容忍下去。</p>
<p>然而，那種騷擾，在地聽來，還是初次，她旣覺得新奇，又表示不信任，這時，她不再矜持着對於地那唯一相識者的那種雅氣，終于向他說話了。</p>
<p>『你把鬥打開，讓我看看！』</p>
<p>『不能！』</p>
<p>『這也不是讓你去給我買報，又麻煩着你啦！』</p>
<p>她似乎又要恢復剛剛消飲的雅氣，而威脅他。　（五六）</p>

<h3>How to Cultivate Young Cadres? Introducing the Teaching Experience of Shaanbei Public School</h3>
<p>— Shao Shiping</p>
<p>(Special Article) Now everyone knows that Shaanbei Public School is a school that adheres to the War of Resistance, insists on a protracted war, upholds the united front, implements national defense education, and cultivates cadres for the War of Resistance. Because it—Shaanbei Public School—has, in fact, become a school that young people across the country "admire like a high mountain and emulate its virtuous conduct, even if they cannot reach it, their hearts yearn for it." I don't want to give another comprehensive explanation of Shaanbei Public School here, but only share some personal experiences on the teaching methods of Shaanbei Public School. Perhaps our experiences are very superficial, but in today's situation where the old education is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the new education—national defense education—is growing with difficulty, contributing some experiences for the reference of national defense education enthusiasts across the country is not entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>I. Characteristics of Teaching at Shaanbei Public School</p>
<p>Shaanbei Public School was born and developed during the War of Resistance, and it has many characteristics. Here, I will only mention a few points regarding teaching:</p>
<p>First, Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is based on a correct educational policy. Teaching method is every way of implementing the school's policy, not simply a technical issue of lectures in the classroom. A school's educational policy is correct, and it will have many very correct teaching methods. If the policy is incorrect, discussing education methods away from the school's educational policy will never lead to correct teaching methods. At the same time, even if the educational policy is correct, if the teaching methods adopted are inappropriate, it will not only fail to achieve the correct methods and even the correct educational policy, but will also be hindered by bad teaching methods or reduce its feasibility. These are all common truths. Shaanbei Public School attaches great importance to the issue of teaching policy in its teaching methods. The educational policy of Shaanbei Public School is to adhere to the War of Resistance, adhere to a protracted war, uphold the united front, implement national defense education, and cultivate cadres for the War of Resistance. Is this correct? Of course, it is completely correct. However, the teaching method is not empty talk, but must be reflected in specific problems. The issue that is inevitably linked here is the issue of teaching material content. What to teach? What to learn? This has a decisive significance on the school's educational policy and teaching methods. If what is taught is incorrect, for example, if the school aims to cultivate talents for the War of Resistance and national construction, but what is taught is not about the War of Resistance and national construction, and even the outlines of the War of Resistance and national construction, the letter to the people by Chairman Chiang, and all the current practical experiences and lessons of the War of Resistance are discarded, and random lectures on the sayings of Confucius and the Book of Songs are given, such a school, to put it bluntly, can never teach well. Shaanbei Public School attaches great importance to the content of teaching, that is, what to teach. In order to ensure the correctness of the content of teaching, to achieve consistency with the educational policy, and to achieve the unity of theory and practice, it has specially emphasized the research work of each department, collected experiences and lessons from all aspects, such as research and sorting, and constantly listed major practical issues in the War of Resistance as the content of teaching materials, strengthened the construction of the textbook, established a broadcasting receiver, and collected practical materials from all parties as much as possible, especially from students, in order to seek the correctness, practicability, and richness of the school's teaching content. Although we have not achieved the ideal level or there are still many shortcomings, attention and effort in this area, and emphasis on this issue, is the primary characteristic of teaching at Shaanbei Public School. Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is built on the foundation of its correct educational policy and correct educational content.</p>
<p>Second, Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is based on the basic principles of revolution. Originally, teaching method is a reflection of the method of social production. The uneven development of Chinese society means that various methods of production exist simultaneously, and this is reflected in the teaching methods, which also have various differences. For example, the methods of imperialism in oppressing and massacring colonies exist in China. As a result, the education methods of massacring students, occupying schools, and barbarically oppressing students also exist. The feudal method of compulsory exploitation of production exists in Chinese society. As a result, feudal teaching methods such as spanking, confinement, and starvation also exist. The capitalist economic method of compulsory deduction of wages, demerits, and expulsion from factories also exists in Chinese society. As a result, capitalist methods such as deducting grades, demerits, and expulsion from school also exist. Shaanbei Public School not only does not adopt, but cannot adopt, the above-mentioned many opposing teaching methods. We deeply know that Shaanbei Public School is also a revolutionary school, a school for the War of Resistance and national construction, and a school for cultivating cadres for the War of Resistance. As a result, in terms of teaching methods, it can only be based on the basic principles of revolution. Originally, revolution depends on the active struggle of the broad masses of people to win. When the masses have not yet understood the necessity of revolutionary action, the revolutionary leaders can only patiently persuade the masses, encourage the masses from their own experiences, improve the masses, mobilize and organize the masses, and absolutely cannot force the masses to make revolution by adopting command and compulsory methods when the majority of the masses have not yet learned from their own experiences that revolution is urgently needed. This is not allowed and is bound to fail. Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is based on this principle. By applying this principle to all aspects of teaching, the spirit of teaching, the attitude of teaching, and the position of teaching are fundamentally different from past teaching. Therefore, I call it a revolutionary teaching method, which can also be said to be a characteristic of Shaanbei Public School's teaching.</p>
<p>Third, the teaching method of Shaanbei Public School is based on the principle of unity of teaching and learning. Teaching and learning are originally contradictory and unified things. Teaching method is to resolve the contradiction between teaching and learning and unify them throughout the entire teaching process. Here, we must consider the uneven level of students at Shaanbei Public School. In the unevenness, we must understand the unified power, which is the consistent requirement of the War of Resistance and national construction. Under the principle that the War of Resistance is above all else, all problems are specifically resolved and unified. What are the specific problems? The relationship between students, the relationship between teachers and students, the relationship between staff members and students and teachers, the relationship between the content of teaching and the understanding of learning, the relationship between the amount of teaching and the degree of acceptance by students, the relationship between various parties, various stages, various places, and various different degrees, and the relationship between educational policies, plans, content, and teaching methods all have contradictions. However, in teaching, we all pay attention to seeking unity and consistency. The method of seeking consistency is to transform the education plan into a learning plan, to lead and organize learning, and to flexibly adopt various different methods to proceed according to the conditions of the specific environment. People think that the unity of teaching and learning means that what is taught is what is learned. Shaanbei Public School believes that it is not enough to understand this issue so simply. It is necessary to ensure that the results of teaching and learning actually complete the teaching plan and realize the school's educational policy. This method is correct and is the unity of teaching and learning. Over the past year, Shaanbei Public School has cultivated more than 5,000 cadres who have fought bloodily with the invaders on various fronts. The students in school are loyal, united, energetic, lively, and fighting in their studies. The entire school, whether cadres, students, staff, or those in school, is united like one person in protecting the school, which proves that Shaanbei Public School's teaching is fundamentally successful. Although we still have some weaknesses in the issue of unity of teaching and learning, we ourselves feel that success is greater than weakness. This can also be said to be a characteristic of Shaanbei Public School's teaching.</p>
<p>Fourth, the teaching method of Shaanbei Public School is based on the specific environment. The question is this: Can teaching only be done under certain conditions? Or can teaching also be done under changing, complex, and difficult conditions? Shaanbei Public School's teaching method answers affirmatively: Teaching can be done under certain conditions, and teaching can also be done under changing, complex, and difficult conditions. In the face of the development of the War of Resistance situation, the latter is more important than the former. This requires changing one's own teaching methods according to the specific environment at that time and place. If one cannot change one's own teaching methods to adapt to and transform the environment, one will not be able to complete one's mission under some new changes. Look at the phenomenon of education across the country, there is no shortage of examples, so there is no need to explain in detail. Here, I will only say how Shaanbei Public School solves this problem. At the Yan'an Main School, there were no teachers, so we adopted the method of inviting celebrities to give lectures to solve the problem. The same difficulty with teachers at the branch school, so we adopted the method of the research room to solve the problem. There were few teachers, so we held large lecture halls. There were no classrooms, so we held classes in the open air. The bandits attempted to disrupt us, so we used armed protection for learning and integrated with the local people to obtain the help of the local party, army, government, and the broad masses of people. The road was difficult to walk, so we opened the road ourselves. The invaders' planes came, so we dug plane caves ourselves. Finally, when the Japanese invaders attempted to attack the Northwest, the school was completely reorganized and opened to the rear of the Japanese invaders. Without these methods, Shaanbei Public School could not be developed, let alone the completion of the education plan.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the teaching methods of Shaanbei Public School's branch schools are roughly like this.</p>
<p>II. The Educational Plan Is the Learning Plan</p>
<p>First, the educational plan is a plan for the entire school's struggle. Once a school's educational policy is determined, a specific implementation plan must be formulated and all methods and forces must be used to achieve its realization. Completing the education plan is the task of the entire school, so it is necessary to mobilize all organizations, departments, and even individuals in the school to consciously and actively rise up to fight for the completion of the education plan. The most important thing is to mobilize teachers, staff members, and students, so that teachers can deeply understand why they are teaching, so that staff members can understand why they are working, and so that students can consciously understand why they are learning. As long as everyone can correctly understand why they are teaching, learning, and working, they will inevitably be able to automatically, actively, and unitedly fight for the completion of their plan. For this purpose, Shaanbei Public School first discussed the educational plan in detail at the school affairs meeting to ensure its correctness, and then mobilized various departments to explain the school's tasks and policies, and improve everyone's political awareness. Then, the educational plan was brought to the teacher research room for discussion; on the first day of class, it was even brought to the students for discussion; the educational plan was reported to the students in detail so that everyone could understand what the goal of their efforts in school was. This will mobilize all the school's manpower and material resources to fight for the realization of the education plan. Some people think that if the education plan is brought to the students for discussion, what if the students disagree? I think it is only a matter of an incorrect educational plan. If it is correct, the students will enthusiastically welcome and support it. Even if some individuals cannot understand it all at once, they will be able to understand it after some persuasion and explanation. If a school's education plan is not dared to be reported to the students, and the students just blindly learn, it will not be possible to mobilize the students to fight for the education plan: and it will not be possible to complete the learning in fact, but the various aspects of the school's education plan. Because if the students are not consciously and actively learning, but use various methods to supervise, oppress, and force the students to learn, the teaching effectiveness will be derelict and even a failure. Therefore, whether the education plan can be effectively completed in the implementation depends on turning the education plan into the center of the struggle for all the school's work, especially to become the students' learning plan.</p>
<p>Second, how can the education plan be specifically transformed into a learning plan? Mobilizing all students to understand the education plan, which is their own learning plan, is only a principle-based method. The specific method is sometimes more important than the principle-based method in work. Turning the education plan into a learning plan, propaganda and explanation is one thing, and specific implementation is another. These two things are related and at the same time separate. How does Shaanbei Public School handle this issue? After the education plan is formulated and publicized and explained, the Department of Education formulates an implementation schedule based on the education plan, and roughly divides out the implementation stages. For example, in the first four weeks, what issues should be completed in Chinese studies, how much time is allocated for teaching and learning, and when. The same goes for other courses. Students are given it in advance, and all students, staff members, and teachers hold meetings to improve the schedule according to the plan, point out reference books, list the learning outline, and then each class formulates the class's weekly and daily learning plan according to the weekly learning plan of the entire team, and the class leader distributes the reference books to the subject representatives in advance. According to the scheduled time, they either look at the reference books, hold discussion meetings, or attend classes, all with preparation and arrangement in advance. In the remaining time, individuals can formulate a plan to read more reference materials. The completion of each person's daily learning plan is the completion of each class's learning plan. The completion of each class's learning plan is the completion of the entire team, which is also the completion of the overall education plan. We call this method planned learning.</p>
<p>Third, has the plan been completed? Some people raise this question, that is, if everyone is allowed to learn freely, will they work hard? Will they all make false reports? What methods are there to understand? This is a very important question, but Shaanbei Public School does not adopt examinations for this question, but instead mobilizes all students, staff members, and teachers to inspect. For example, has each class completed its own plan each week? This can be summarized at the full-class learning plan meeting every Saturday. Because the whole class lives and studies together every day, and everyone knows why they are learning, and it is a learning plan formulated by themselves, of course, they will automatically, actively, and diligently work hard, and they can also understand the learning progress of each person in the discussion. Because teachers and staff members are participating in learning and discussion, the students automatically initiate learning competitions, help each other, and encourage each other. Everyone understands who is working hard and progressing in learning. Secondly, there is a regular large inspection of the implementation of the education plan. When each stage of the plan is completed, the Department of Education organizes all personnel participating in the execution of the plan, such as teachers, staff members, students, and administrative personnel, to hold a meeting to inspect. Everyone prepares their opinions in advance, and the Department of Education also collects materials from all parties in advance and examines and sorts the materials in advance. At the inspection meeting, they promote their advantages and point out their weaknesses to each other, study the sources of their advantages and the methods to overcome their weaknesses, and plan new struggle plans. With this, whether the education plan has been completed, what else is there not to understand?</p>
<p>Fourth, the changes in the education plan, the education plan is not dead, nor is it immutable, especially in the face of the development of the War of Resistance and national construction situation, it cannot be immutable, because many issues are correct today, but may not be correct tomorrow; therefore, the education plan cannot but have some changes. This kind of change is also a change in the learning plan. Whenever the entire school gains a new major development, Shaanbei Public School inevitably formulates a temporary learning plan. For example, in the third phase of the War of Resistance, Baode Wuhan, On Protracted War, On the New Stage: special plans are formulated for research, and after such a research, there will inevitably be some new things added in the content of teaching and learning. This makes teaching consistent with practice, and at the same time makes the education plan even more transformed into a learning plan. Because the practical problems in the War of Resistance are what everyone urgently demands to understand. Some people think that Shaanbei Public School's education plan changes too quickly, and I think it is a fact that it changes too quickly. However, the actual life changes even faster than our education plan! However, basically we have not changed. This is to fight Japan and save China.</p>
<p>The issue of the education plan being the learning plan is like this.</p>
<p>III. The Center of the Educational Method Lies in Leadership and Organization of Learning</p>
<p>I once said that the teaching method is every method adopted to implement the school's education plan. In this way, the teaching method includes a wide range of things, but its center is in leading and organizing learning.</p>
<p>First, what is called leading learning? It means that the thing to be learned is a completely new path that the students have never taken, while the teachers have probably walked this path once or twice, or at least they can grasp the direction very well. Therefore, the teacher is a response to learning and helps learning overcome difficulties. This is one. Secondly, the members of Shaanbei Public School are all revolutionary advanced soldiers, some are revolutionary leaders, they teach for the War of Resistance and national construction, and they are even more consciously responsible for leading teaching for the young people who come to study for the War of Resistance and national construction. If the center of the school is learning, then the center of teaching is leading learning. The students of Shaanbei Public School can all understand the importance of their responsibility to the youth, so they work very hard on the research of teaching materials, and often get sick due to excessive hard work. They cannot be ambiguous about the weekly problems. They attend student plan meetings and discussion meetings, carefully answer various questions raised by the students, and discuss various issues with the students. On some issues, especially in the actual work of the War of Resistance and national construction, because of different experiences, they sometimes learn from the students. For example, regarding mass movements, especially youth and women's movements, many students come from actual work, and they have vivid materials. These materials are worth collecting and studying. Only in this way can the responsibility of leading learning be realized.</p>
<p>Second, what is called organizing learning? If the school has an educational policy and an educational plan, and they are both correct, then it is necessary to find the forces to struggle to implement the educational policy and plan. The organization of students and the allocation of cadres are the forces to realize the educational policy and plan. The students of Shaanbei Public School are generally very enthusiastic about the War of Resistance and national construction. The teachers and staff members of Shaanbei Public School are even more soldiers and leaders of the War of Resistance and national construction. But how can such a foundation be organized into a greater student force? Teachers are organized in various research rooms according to the various subjects, and students are organized into study classes, squads, and teams. The class is the unit of learning, the team is the unit of education, and according to the unit of education, this part of the teachers, staff members, and students are organized under the education plan to work together. Therefore, the team leader becomes the center of leading and organizing learning; the class leader becomes the core of learning; the squad leader is the bridge between the implementation of the education plan and the learning unit; the instructor is the assistant in leading and organizing learning: the student union is the organization for organizing learning, and the subject representative is the liaison between the teacher and the student, and at the same time the organizer of a subject's learning. In this way, under the goal of striving for the smooth completion of the educational plan and the learning plan, a strict team for learning is organized. Only with such a force can the victory of the education plan be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Third, the central link of leading and organizing learning is the mutual trust and mutual respect between teachers, staff members, and students. Whenever the students of Shaanbei Public School see a teacher coming, there is often thunderous applause, expressing their welcome to the teacher. There are also individual teams that prepare paper cigarettes to comfort the teacher. If the teacher is sometimes not feeling well, the students will send representatives to express their condolences. In the students' view, the teachers are all leaders and organizers of the youth, and should be believed in and respected. The teachers of Shaanbei Public School are also truly responsible, and will never ask for leave or be absent from class unless it is absolutely necessary; if they are accidentally absent from class, for example, due to heavy rain and no classroom, some teachers are willing to automatically make up the class at night or on Sunday; there are also individual teachers who teach barefoot in the rain, which makes the whole class of students express their respect to him. In the teachers' view, this group of young people are the trustees of China's destiny, the soldiers of the War of Resistance, the leaders of the masses, and the creators of China; doing more work for them will increase the strength of the War of Resistance and national construction, which is their duty. Our teacher Comrade He Gan of farewell at the conference of the graduating students going to the front line said:</p>
<p>"The students who are graduating and going to the front line will use guns and cannons to fight the invaders bloodily on the front line, and I will use pens and mouths here to fight the invaders. The front and the rear will use all weapons and forces to drive the Japanese invaders out of China."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the teachers of Shaanbei Public School regard their teaching career as a part of the sacred cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, respect their own cause, are loyal to their own cause, and at the same time trust all the students, and place the sacred cause of the War of Resistance and national construction on themselves and the youth of the country. In this way, there has never been a student strike or a teacher incident in Shaanbei Public School. The key to the mutual trust and respect between teachers and students is the staff, especially the team leader. The team leader is the executor and organizer of the education plan. He not only plans the learning of the entire team in detail, making all the work in order to strive for the victory of learning, but also has to organize and allocate various forces. Originally, learning is the same as fighting a war. On the front line, the team, company, platoon, and squad leaders are very important. After teaching has decided on all the plans, the team leader and instructor have a decisive significance in learning. Because the team leader must unite the teachers and organize the students in every way, and all the forces that can be used to lead and educate learning should be organized into leading and organizing exercises. Only in this way can the education plan be changed into a learning plan, and its successful implementation can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Fourth, competition in organizing and learning and specific mutual help. With a plan for learning and a learning team, the teams, classes, and individuals, under the mobilization of the teaching room and the student union, often voluntarily propose learning competitions to each other, just like the fighting competitions in the War of Resistance troops. They deeply know that their learning is learning for the War of Resistance, so they send representatives to negotiate the rules of the competition and hire judges, report their learning plans and efforts to the judges and the competing opponents, learn from each other's advantages, and help each other overcome weaknesses. The example can create a learning movement among all the students in the school, and in the movement, they can understand their individual abilities: qualities: promote the strong ones, and help the weak ones. This kind of help is very specific. For example, in order to win the competition, a class must have all the internal members understand each other's advantages and disadvantages and take specific measures. Sometimes it is specifically decided that someone will help someone. This not only intensifies learning, but also strengthens unity. However, the organization of this competition is not a school regulation, but a method of the students' automatic efforts to learn. The organizers of the competition are often centered on the student union and the salvation room. However, all education should actively support and help and guide its progress, and prevent the phenomenon of formalism, empty names, and unfinished business. If the students do not feel the need for competition, and only one or two leaders formulate a competition plan and announce it, then it is better not to have the competition. Shaanbei Public School has been very successful in organizing competitions in the vast majority of cases. There are achievements, but there are also individual cases where the competition is treated as a child's play, or has not been launched, or there are individual cases that go to the wrong direction of trophies. However, as soon as the school discovers that there is an incorrect trend, it helps to quickly correct it, which is the responsibility of the youth leader.</p>
<p>IV. The Significance of Teaching Success</p>
<p>What should be the standard for the victory of teaching and learning? Some people think that it is a victory to finish teaching the textbooks stipulated in the plan. In fact, such an understanding is not enough, but the same fact can be encountered everywhere. I think that the success of teaching is not simply a matter of teaching textbooks. In fact, there are no textbooks. Teaching can still be done in the same way. Many courses in Shaanbei Public School do not have textbooks. Is Shaanbei Public School teaching? It is teaching and teaching correctly. What is the reason for this? It is that education is not simply teaching textbooks. In fact, I think that the real success of teaching should have the following three standards:</p>
<p>First, to give the students correct knowledge, and the students truly understand and master it, and can flexibly apply it to practice, not verbatim recitation, nor rote memorization of formulas.</p>
<p>Second, to cultivate students not only with knowledge and ability, but also with the determination and belief to sacrifice and fight for the realization of what they have learned, not empty talk, and even less to be someone who puts up a sheep's head and sells dog meat.</p>
<p>Third, having knowledge, ability, determination, and confidence is basic and important, but the responsibility of education does not stop there. At the same time, it is also necessary to exercise their bodies so that they have the strength to shoulder the tasks they should bear.</p>
<p>Shaanbei Public School puts the success of teaching under the standards mentioned above, and thus deeply knows that education is not only about recognizing talents, but more importantly about cultivating talents. Originally, there are indeed many talents, and the school should further improve him and promote him, so that he can become a stronger cadre in the War of Resistance and national construction. The vast majority of those who were not originally talents and need to be cultivated into talents by the school, but they have a high degree of enthusiasm for the War of Resistance, and the school should make every effort to make them enthusiastically encouraged and progress forward. Even if there are one or two who are relatively backward in their thinking, as long as they are not members of the invaders, traitors, or Trotskyites, the school has the responsibility to transform them: patient persuasion, arduous education, and sometimes to win one or two such students, the responsible comrades of the school often spend a lot of time talking and educating. Therefore, some students believe that "those who cannot be educated in Shaanbei Public School are incurable." The school cherishes talents and cultivates talents in this way, so the students also cherish the school very much. At every difficulty facing the school, all the students are concerned to the utmost, especially in the material aspects, they get a lot of help from the students, donating money, donating old things, and donating radios, and have made great achievements. The development of Shaanbei Public School over the past year has been greatly benefited from the students. Here, I would like to express my lofty respect for the students who cherish the alma mater of Shaanbei Public School for the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>In order to fully complete the teaching mission, individual specific education, cultivation, cherishment, and help are very important. But it is even more important to generally cultivate a good school spirit, cultivate loyalty and unity, a spirit of tension and liveliness, a hardworking work style, and improve students' military capabilities and life. The most excellent style of Shaanbei Public School is loyalty, unity, tension, and liveliness. Whether in learning, work, or life, whether in students or cadres, it is fully manifested. Under the influence of such an excellent school spirit, whether they are members of the Communist Party, members of the Kuomintang, or people without party affiliation, they are united like one person, loving each other, trusting each other, and working hard together for the school's mission and the school's education plan. In establishing and promoting a good school spirit, the exemplary role of cadres, the learning of cadres, and the unity of cadres are very important keys. Shaanbei Public School has been very successful in its cadre policy. The school's love and education for cadres is a regular work. For example, the cadre class has classes twice a week, and the branch school has not been relaxed from the beginning until the reorganization. The improvement and unity of cadres is the center of improving and uniting the entire school, and it is also the foundation for achieving the goal of teaching victory.</p>
<p>Under the new situation, Shaanbei Public School is developing forward with a new attitude. I believe that with the love of the whole country and the efforts of the whole school, we will surely be able to achieve new achievements in the new struggle. From the establishment of Shaanbei Public School until the reorganization, I have been working in the Department of Education at Shaanbei Public School, and I am deeply ashamed of my lack of learning and ability. I have not studied anything about Dalton's system or Dewey's educational philosophy. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after Presidents Sun Suicheng and Luo, I tried my best and with the help of all the students and teachers and staff, I was fortunate to be innocent, and I was happy for myself. Now I am ordered to transfer to the front line, and formally, I have to leave Shaanbei Public School. I specially write down some personal experiences to ask for advice from those who are enthusiastic about national defense education across the country, and at the same time I respectfully wish the comrades and students of Shaanbei Public School good health.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Youth Movement in a New Phase</h3>
<p>Twenty years ago today, an unprecedented youth movement in China, a model for the world, was launched by students in Beijing. In bloodshed and resolute progress, it awakened the entire Chinese nation under the oppression of feudal remnants and ××-ism. It developed from a purely patriotic student movement into a political movement encompassing youth from all walks of life, including industry, commerce, and agriculture. It further evolved into a new enlightenment movement in modern Chinese history, paving the way for the Great Revolution of 1925-27 and opening up a path for the Chinese nation to move from a democratic and scientific movement toward building a new China with "national independence, civil rights and freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness."</p>
<p>Twenty years ago today, the Chinese nation began to voice its first roar for liberation, mobilizing students, workers, merchants, farmers, and eventually attracting a large number of soldiers to fight for liberation. This roar and struggle have long been recognized as a signal and alarm bell for the rebirth of Eastern culture! And Chinese youth, with a pioneering attitude, met the world and occupied a very important position in the world's progressive movement.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, the entire Chinese nation has inherited the glorious spirit of struggle that began twenty years ago today. For the liberation of the Chinese nation and the defense of the rebirth of world culture, it has been drawn into an unprecedented anti-Japanese war that affects the whole world. This war has had a history-breaking impact throughout China and on the world. It has gained the full support of a magnificent socialist country created by the workers themselves, and it has also gained the sympathy and assistance of capitalist countries that love democracy and peace and the vast majority of righteous people around the world. It has promoted and expanded the revolutionary movement launched twenty years ago today, and has laid the foundation for victory in twenty-two months of arduous fighting. Nevertheless, we must also sincerely point out that our glorious and sacred struggle has not yet escaped the dangerous period. No, precisely because our struggle has achieved great and urgent significance for the entire nation and even the world, the × people have mobilized all the reactionary, dark, corrupt, and evil forces to prepare for the final counterattack. Therefore, we are facing the final moment of life and death, we will face a more serious, more difficult, and darker period; and what is particularly worth our vigilance is that all the foreign invaders who were our targets of attack twenty years ago, especially the Japanophile faction, traitors, and those who sell the country, the corrupt and backward, the stubborn conservatives, who are enslaved by Japanese aggressors, have, under the guise of Wang Jingwei's "anti-communist peace" theory, under the guise of the German and Italian superiority group's "anti-communist group," not only colluded more closely, but also played with the fascist and anti-democratic weapons concocted by the invaders, in order to use their skills of instigating, tempting, and deceiving, and launched various forms of general offensive against us!</p>
<p>The countercurrent will eventually be eliminated under the resistance of our vast and strong national united front, but we want to specifically raise the issue of the youth movement in the new phase here, we want to specifically recognize the youth movement in the new phase, which is also the issue of carrying forward the spirit of the "May Fourth" Youth Movement twenty years ago. The main content of this issue is, first of all, to carry forward the patriotic movement like a hurricane and angry wave in the May Fourth Youth Movement, on the one hand, to mobilize the vast number of young people to participate in the national construction cause, especially to increase , on the other hand, to step up the promotion of mass propaganda movement, with the spirit of the May Fourth youth mass going deep into the people, to widely mobilize the vivid power of the entire nation. The second is to carry forward the anti-traitor and anti-national traitor movement like a hurricane and angry wave in the May Fourth Youth Movement, from all aspects, using all methods, to fight against all current traitors, puppet traitors, and pseudo-organizations, , especially to make Wang's faction's "anti-communist peace" traitor...theory a strong backer. We must regard the struggle against traitorous theories and actions as the central task of youth in the future. Third, it is to carry forward the anti-feudal and anti-autocratic and promote democracy and promote the spirit of science in the May Fourth Youth Movement, and promote a new enlightenment movement that guarantees the victory of the liberation of the Chinese nation. The main tasks are (1) to follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, to strive for the participation of young male and female students in politics, and to ensure the development of the youth movement; (2) to follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, to strive to ensure the comprehensive implementation of education, relief, organization, training, and the training and promotion of a large number of party members and cadres. (3) To expand the movement to eliminate illiteracy across the country, especially to expand the wartime cultural movement in the war zone, ×, rear areas, and overseas Chinese communities; (4) To intensify closer ties with the international community and strive for the consolidation, expansion, and success of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>Regarding the main tasks of the youth movement in the new phase, we would like to put forward the above points here as a minimum work program for the current year-round sector to practice, and how to establish a free system, how to develop learning and work competitions, how to carry out the work of striving for freedom and political participation, and how to enrich and expand the national united front of the youth sector, but it must be regarded as daily work, adapt to local environments, and resolutely and bravely promote it.</p>

<h3>Complete Victory in the Air Battle over Chongqing; Enemy Planes Attacked, Suffering Heavy Blows Midway; One Plane Shot Down Among the Twenty-Two Raiders over Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Chongqing, Associated Press, 3rd] This afternoon, this place suffered a large-scale bombing by Japanese planes, the first since mid-January. It is said that a total of forty-five Japanese bombers suddenly appeared over Chongqing, but only twenty-two actually entered the airspace over the city of Chongqing. Many of the remaining planes were intercepted by Chinese fighters on the banks of the Yangtze River. The Chinese side estimates that three Japanese planes were shot down. An Associated Press reporter personally witnessed one Japanese plane crashing and two Japanese pilots descending by parachute. Both sides engaged in fierce battles over Chongqing. The Japanese planes fought and retreated. The air battle extended to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were all incendiary bombs and small bombs, setting off seven major fires. The fire was most intense along the riverbank, occupying an area of about a quarter of a mile. Among the foreign properties destroyed was the Sino-French Shipping Company, which was hit by a bomb and completely burned down. Streetlights and telephone lines along the streets in the commercial area were all cut off by the bombing, and the fire spread, with smoke filling the sky. After the Japanese planes left, rescue teams and police officers were dispatched to teach. The Japanese planes attempted to completely destroy the city of Chongqing and twice flew in formation over the city from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, indiscriminately bombing the commercial area, residential area, and government area, dropping a bomb about every two minutes. At the same time, the Japanese planes also strafed the people below with machine guns. The Chinese anti-aircraft guns on the ground returned fire, so bullets flew across the sky. The banks of the river were also bombed, and several civilian ships were destroyed. The number of casualties is estimated to be more than 500, with more than 100 dead. However, because the fire and smoke have not yet cleared, some may be buried, so it is still difficult to ascertain the exact number.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 3rd] Some sources estimate that the number of casualties in today's large-scale bombing is over a thousand, as a refugee shelter was completely destroyed, with about 300 refugees inside, all of whom were buried alive. However, it is not yet known whether they were all killed. Four newspaper offices, including Ta Kung Pao, New China Daily, New Sichuan Daily, and Sichuan Daily, were bombed. The Sichuan Daily has been completely destroyed and cannot be published in the short term. The air defense headquarters was also bombed, and a large amount of stored gasoline was also hit and immediately burned down. It has been proven that the city's scattering cellars played a great role in this bombing. It is believed here that 1,000 casualties cannot be considered many. At the same time, the rescue teams and volunteer teams and the city's water storage facilities are excellent, so they can quickly rescue after the bombing and announce the extinguishment (according to a telegram from the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao to the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, when the × planes bombed Chongqing, the newspaper's building was damaged by the shock, but the staff were safe).</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 3rd] At 11:20 a.m. on the 3rd, the local air defense headquarters reported from Yuanling that many × planes were flying from east to west. At around 12:30 p.m., it reported again from Youyang that two batches of × planes, 18 each, were flying northwest. An air raid alert was issued at 12:45 p.m. Our planes also took off to intercept them immediately. At 12:55 p.m., an emergency alert was issued. The × planes invaded the city's airspace at 1:17 p.m. The target of their bombing seemed to be a certain military institution, but the military institutions had already evacuated to the countryside. The skills of the × pilots were also extremely poor, resulting in the nearby shops and homes suffering heavy bombing. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, there were also a large number of incendiary bombs. The areas of West 4th Street and Zuoying Street immediately caught fire and burned for a long time. At this time, our defense and police corps were dispatched amidst the sound of explosions to teach. In extreme indignation, their spirits were invigorated and their work was intense. Their emotions and sense of responsibility were fully demonstrated. The general public was also very calm and obeyed the order, with no chaos. The people also showed the greatest determination. The number of deaths and injuries and public and private losses are being actively excavated and cleared. At the same time, the Air Defense Department and the Joint Office for Emergency Relief for Air Raids are handling the aftermath. As the × planes were fiercely attacked by us, they mourned and escaped at 1:30 p.m. It is said that one was shot down by us and is now being searched for in the vicinity of Zheng. Also, today the × planes dropped hundreds of packs of red-paper-wrapped (Great Lu New Moon brand) cigarettes. Whether they contain toxic gas is being tested.</p>
<p>[Reuter, Chongqing, 3rd] Several Japanese planes heavily bombed this area with a dense population today. This is the first time this year. There are multiple fires breaking out. It is said that the casualties are very heavy.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] At 1:15 p.m. today, 27 Japanese bombers attempted to carry out an air raid on Chongqing. Chinese fighter planes immediately took to the air to engage them, immediately shooting down one Japanese bomber. The Japanese planes dropped many incendiary bombs, destroying quite a bit of property.</p>

<p>After Our Adoption of New Offensive, Fierce Battles Recently in Urban Areas</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Newspaper Industry in Arduous Struggle; The Leader and Translator Automatically Stop Publication for One Day; Protesting the Banning of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Speech</h3>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] The English-owned Chinese newspapers "The Leader" and "The Translator" here have voluntarily ceased publication for one day today because the British Consul banned the publication of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration on May 1st. Other American-owned Chinese newspapers have published the entire declaration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] The British Consulate General in Shanghai convened a meeting of publishers of English-owned Chinese newspapers on the 22nd of last month. During the meeting, the British Consulate instructed the following six prohibitions from being published:</p>
<p>1. The words "traitor", "enemy", "strong man", etc.</p>
<p>2. ×× - indicating the Japanese.</p>
<p>3. Announcements, etc., relating to the Kuomintang or similar organizations.</p>
<p>4. ×× - implying the Japanese.</p>
<p>5. All news relating to anti-war sentiment and movements occurring within Japan or among Japanese troops in China.</p>
<p>6. Propaganda news or submissions of an anti-Japanese nature that could incite anti-Japanese sentiment or create anti-Japanese terrorist incidents.</p>
<p>After hearing this, the publishers of the various foreign-owned Chinese newspapers were answered by Pace, who said that British newspapers had a traditional freedom, and that if various prohibitions were to be stipulated, it would be in clear violation of the Constitution, so the authorities of the Consulate General had no such authority. If it is necessary to stipulate various prohibitions, it must be resolved in the British Parliament.</p>
<p>(Note: There are six English-owned Chinese newspapers in Shanghai, four dailies and two evening newspapers: (1) Wenhui Pao, (2) Translator, (3) The Leader, (4) International Daily, (5) Great Evening News, (6) Great British Evening News.

<h3>A New Force in the Resistance: The North China Railway Destruction Team (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhengfei</p>
<p>His method of destruction is very simple, relying on his simple mechanical knowledge, which makes the enemy's vigilance very high. After being fooled once and having a locomotive blown up, they immediately tried every means to detect our actions. However, the result was still that the locomotive was decorated with a big lottery - it was destroyed. In order to avoid the locomotive's "Tai Ge death", the enemy finally installed two or three "tin cars" filled with stones in front of the locomotive. The old method worked once. Twice they were really blown up by this worthless tin car, and the locomotive was unharmed. But then they gained another method. Finally, under the protection of the third "tin" pioneer car lamp, they still sent the buying and selling car to the new head station. For the convenience of the destruction team's continued work in the future, the reporter is not accurate to say much about the many ingenious methods of the second team. In short, any enemy's strict prevention and countermeasures cannot stop the destruction team's activities, unless it concentrates all its forces on both sides of the railway line, making the soldiers stand in single-file columns, more densely than telephone poles. Otherwise, this railway destruction team can still multiply in his gaps like mercury. But can the enemy have such a large force? If it is true that they are gathered together, making it impossible for the destruction team to move, then we can glue together many enemy divisions without spending a bullet or a soldier. Therefore, the reporter said that the railway destruction team is the economic force of the resistance, the economic resistance force. Although that is the case, this railway destruction team cannot survive without the assistance of the local people and the cover of the army. The people near the accident site have exhausted many means of writing threatening letters. If the people cannot recognize the importance of this kind of action and are unwilling to endure the enemy's cruel blame, reporting to × at any time, then naturally all adventurous efforts have been paid to the stream. Therefore, the activities of the railway destruction team must first obtain the cooperation of the local people. The success of the railway destruction team on Daoxiao Road is indeed the effort of the tin destruction team under the leadership of ×××, and it is also the achievement of the people there. Secondly, it is because divisions such as ×× have already selected soldiers to learn from this destruction team in large numbers, making the work of destroying the railway now spread to the ×× Road. The reporter hopes that the troops in other battlefields across the country can also follow suit, so that the work of destruction can be spread to every transportation artery occupied by the enemy, which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the future of the resistance.

<h3>"May 3rd" Commemoration Day in Shanghai; Flag Hanging Causes Conflict; Police Arrest Eight People; Situation Tense for a Time</h3>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] This afternoon, a small conflict occurred between Chinese shops and patrolmen in the area of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road over the issue of county flags.

<p>[Reuter, Shanghai, 3rd] When a wedding was held in a certain house in southern Shanghai yesterday, the house suddenly collapsed, killing eighteen people and injuring forty-four. The bride was crushed to death, and the groom was also injured and unconscious, lying unconscious beside her.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] After the Tongfu Road incident occurred, a large team of patrolmen went to the scene and summoned three teams of White Russian Volunteers to guard the area, demanding that Chinese shops remove the national flag.

<h3>300 Female Students Petition in Formation; Demand Release of Principal</h3>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] After the Shanghai Municipal Council interfered in the matter of Chinese shops hanging flags on Tongfu Road, about 300 female students went to Chengdu Road Police Station in formation, demanding the right to freely hang the national flag. The police station is currently feeling the heat of this problem, because they do not want to use force against these female students. Therefore, there is currently no way to decide, and it is feared that they will stay in the police station until they become tired. They also indicated that the activists may be arrested.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] The reason why the Chinese female students went to the patrol station was because the patrolmen ordered the principal to take down the flag when the school hung flags to commemorate May 3rd.

The female students of the school then went in formation. After negotiations, the principal was released, and the female students all returned home. The national flag was also taken down.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Plane Attacked Last Month in French Indochina; British Ambassador Fortunately Canceled Ticket; Japanese Plane's Target Deserves Attention</h3>
<p>[Local News] According to the "Smesy" newspaper, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had originally reserved a seat to fly to Chongqing, but then, for some reason, he canceled his ticket at the last minute. The plane, en route from Hanoi to Chongqing, was suddenly attacked by Japanese planes. It is reported that the Japanese authorities were paying close attention to the movements of personnel from the British Embassy in China, and they had the latest information on their every move. The fact that the plane was attacked is particularly noteworthy. According to the pilot, when the Eurasia plane was attacked, it was definitely within French territory. The Japanese planes participating in the attack numbered as many as six, and they came with great ferocity, constantly strafing the plane with machine guns. Seeing this, the pilot quickly tried to fly the plane into the dense clouds near the mountain peaks to hide. The Japanese planes also circled around the dense clouds, and every time the Eurasia plane emerged from the clouds, they immediately resumed strafing with machine guns and guns. This went on for half an hour, and the pilot then decided to land. Fortunately, the plane landed safely within Chinese territory, but the Japanese planes did not stop and continued to drop bombs and strafe the landing area with machine guns. After the Japanese planes left, an unexploded bomb was found 5,000 meters from the landing site within French territory. The location of the Japanese plane attack on the Eurasia plane was at the border between Chinese and French territory. Subsequently, the French authorities in Hanoi dispatched another plane for the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to fly to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Guiyang After the Bombing</h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>[Special Correspondence from Guiyang] At nine o'clock in the morning, I boarded the Ministry of Transportation's car again to go to Guiyang. All along the way were high mountains and steep ridges, and the car jumped and bounced violently. At twelve o'clock, I arrived in Guiyang. The section of the street from outside the city to the Far East Hotel can still be considered prosperous. This is also the only surviving lifeline after the Japanese planes frantically bombed Guiyang city on February 4th. According to statistics from the local Civilians' Association, 42 streets were affected, more than 1,300 households were destroyed, and more than 13,400 people were affected. The tragic situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>Because Guiyang is currently the transportation center of the Southwest, with highways leading east to Chengde and Changsha in western Hunan, south to Guilin in Guangxi, west to Kunming in Yunnan, northwest to Yijie, and north to Guizhou in Sichuan, and south through Xuanwei in Yunnan to Kunming. Going north from Guizhou, the Qianchuan Highway leads directly to Chongqing. Therefore, although Guiyang has just experienced a great calamity, it is still overcrowded today. The streets, taverns, and even every large and small inn are full of people, and the cost of living is surprisingly high. A guest meal costs at least seventy cents of a silver dollar. Underwear and undershirts all cost three or four yuan apiece, ordinary leather shoes are priced at twenty-five yuan, and pork costs just over two jin per yuan... As the small tea boy in the Far East Hotel said to me, "Guiyang has become Guiyang (expensive ocean)!" It is impossible to do anything without silver dollars. The cost of living in the countryside compared to the city is almost ten times different. This kind of abnormal and disparate situation really needs to be corrected. Economic tactics in the long-term war of resistance should also "cooperate" with military operations. "We cannot concentrate our forces at one point, giving the Japanese the opportunity to break through our main force. Therefore, building the countryside and dispersing capital to the western countryside" should be the proper steps for economic warfare in the second phase.</p>
<p>The surviving local newspapers after the bombing are the Central Daily News and the Revolutionary Daily News. The Chongqing-based Ta Kung Pao, Xinhua Daily, and Saodang Daily are also available every other day. Bookstores include Life Bookstore, World Bookstore, Self-Reliance Bookstore, Military Academy Bookstore... Among them, the best business and the most crowded are probably the World Bookstore and Life Bookstore. The latter is only open for five hours a day, from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. It is said that in these five hours, they can average 200 yuan in sales. Among them, magazines sell the best.</p>
<p>The situation of the March 8th Charity Bazaar in Guiyang was not very good. Many wives of important people were giving speeches while gesticulating around the copper and iron booths. Female students from Great China University were also doing group charity sales. The Central Daily News, Revolutionary Daily News... also organized charity sales teams. But the result was less than 4,000 yuan. If each of the 140,000 citizens contributed an average of five cents, it would amount to 7,000 yuan. Moreover, the current population is larger than before, and those who come are all wealthy. Given these results, we cannot deny that the atmosphere in Guiyang is still far from resembling a rear area of ​​resistance. On the other hand, the ticket prices for Peking opera are extremely expensive (including the donation, one yuan and seventy cents of a silver dollar per ticket), but the theaters are crowded every night. It is also said that if you don't tell the ticket seller what your background is first, it's really hard to buy even one good seat.</p>
<p>When I visited the five committee members of the provincial government, I was told that everything has progressed rapidly since the Central Army entered Guizhou in 1935. Since Wu Dingchang has been in charge of Guizhou, he has had good personal relations and financial resources, so many facilities have been implemented according to plan. Currently, the central tasks of the administration are roughly no more than conscription, strengthening local politics, and developing industry. Guizhou's prefectures and counties follow the principle of contributing money if they have money and contributing effort if they have effort, so they pay special attention to conscription. Currently, an average of seven or eight thousand conscripts are enlisting each month, and local politics are being improved, so progress will be rapid in the future.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Mining Bureau, the Agriculture Bureau, and the Cooperative Treasury, the industry of Guizhou Province has been greatly improved. Mercury in Tongren and Shengxi, coal in Zunyi, Anshun, and Pingyue, iron in Qingxi... are also being developed.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, two years ago, the people's tung oil was difficult to transport and had no market, so the people were very distressed. Later, the government helped them find ways to transport it and tried their best to sell the tung oil produced in the province. As a result, the people were very happy. Now, tung oil is more expensive than vegetable oil, and tung seeds are more expensive than tung oil, because everyone is buying tung seeds and working hard to plant tung trees.</p>
<p>Tangshan Engineering College of Jiaotong University is now in Pingyue, and Great China University and Guizhou Medical College are both in the city. In addition, many cultural figures, intellectuals, and technical personnel from all over the country come to Guiyang, so the government is taking this opportunity to run training classes for local administrative personnel and training classes for Baojia chiefs to gather talents from all walks of life in order to strengthen the efficiency of local political institutions. Naturally, these are all very practical and immediately visible achievements.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked about the issue of the "barbarians." He believes that this is by no means a national issue, as some people say, but simply an education issue. Because from the actual situation, the Han and Miao people in Guizhou are originally like one family, and there is fundamentally no political or economic conflict of interest. Frankly speaking, the Miao people's cultural level and political standards have not yet reached the point of making political claims and suggestions. Therefore, our most important work at present is how to educate, enlighten, and improve their lives.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Guizhou has no three sunny days." The reporter stayed in Guizhou for two weeks, but the sky cleared and the sun shone every day, and the weather was clear. Perhaps the weather has also changed with the times. Because the sky is clear, the fear of air raids constantly threatens people's hearts. A frightened bird is originally fragile and cannot be snatched away. (Salvation Society Appointment)</p>

<h3>German Troops Gather on Polish Border; Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious; Polish Counter-Demands Adopt Resolute Attitude; German Foreign Minister to Go to Rome for Consultations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] It was announced here that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will leave here tomorrow night for Italy, for a stay of several days. He will meet with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Foreign political circles believe that Germany and Italy intend to discuss taking joint action to respond to the "encirclement group." It is believed that Danzig and Poland will be the subject of Ribbentrop's talks with Ciano. When the Polish Foreign Minister delivers a reply to Hitler's speech in Parliament on the 5th, Ribbentrop will still be in Rome, so the reaction of the Axis countries is very smooth. It is reported that any demands by Poland in Danzig will be severely rejected by Germany, and Mussolini has also promised to fully support Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] According to unconfirmed rumors in diplomatic circles here, Mussolini has advised Hitler to handle the dispute with Poland with caution, as Italy is unwilling to be drawn into a war over Danzig. Although the rumor did not specify whether Italy would fight alongside Germany if the Danzig dispute led to war, foreign observers believe that the Italian people do not want to think about it. They believe that if Britain can remain neutral, fighting with France would be most welcome; otherwise, they would rather focus on solving the problem of increasingly difficult domestic life. Local newspapers carried a dispatch from Paris stating that France hopes Italy can be responsible for mediating the dispute between Germany and Poland, which has profound implications. It is generally believed that Italy has no intention of allowing Hitler and Poland to have a genuine conflict.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] The attention of French political circles continues to be focused on the Danzig issue. Most French political commentators believe that there is no possibility of coordination between Germany and Poland on the Danzig dispute. According to reports received this afternoon, the Polish government has notified Britain of its draft counter-demands, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Poland retains sovereignty over Danzig; (2) Poland controls the Danzig Senate; (3) Danzig is occupied by Polish troops; (4) Poland controls Danzig's heavy industry. "Paris Evening News" particularly emphasized the extension of the term of the German Ambassador to Poland. The visit of the French Ambassador to Poland to Berlin also has great significance. It is generally speculated that this move is related to Burke's visit to France on the 15th of this month. The other evening newspapers all believe that relations between Germany and Poland have entered an extremely serious stage.</p>
<p>[Warsaw, 3rd] Local newspapers are writing articles urging people to defend their country, and quoting the speech of Nationalist Party leader Kowalski, "If war breaks out in Europe, it must be due to German aggression, just like the Great War of 1914. Germany has now begun to advance eastward, and Poland will once again be an obstacle to its eastward advance. If Germany continues to advance eastward, it will be met with armed resistance. Poland will not only fight to protect its own direct interests, but also to oppose Germany's expansion of power to other parts of Europe. We only want to maintain the power of free nations, and we have no intention of encircling Germany. We are not afraid of war and are well prepared to meet any challenge."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The German newspapers' attacks on Poland have become increasingly sharp and violent, mostly focused on two points: (1) Poland seems to have forgotten that it is neighboring a strong country; (2) After accepting Britain's guarantee, it has become too credulous. The "Hamburg Newspaper Foreign Edition" stated: "If Poland begins to engage in propaganda that is not coordinated with East Prussia, then in terms of reason and emotion, Germany should consider establishing an indestructible chain with that endangered province." According to observations in political circles, Germany will not take any active action on the German-Polish dispute before Burke delivers his speech on May 5, because Burke's speech will state Poland's position based on Hitler's declaration. According to visitors to the German-Polish border, troop convoys can be seen gathering in various towns, but officials have stated that the border has always been heavily guarded, so there are no special military activities. It is reported that troops recently transferred back from Bohemia and Moravia, who were originally supposed to be given leave, have also been transferred to the Polish border to reinforce defenses.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] German newspapers recently made inflammatory statements about German-Polish relations. Political figures believe that this is the beginning of German pressure on Poland in order to demand the return of Danzig. On the other hand, it is said that this is deliberately demonstrating to the Polish Foreign Minister and affecting his speech on Friday. The "Official Gazette" stated that Britain and France instigated Poland to participate in the encirclement of Germany.</p>
<h3>German Government Conducting Efforts to Conciliate Nordic Countries; Proposes Mutual Guarantees; Governments are Studying the Matter</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Copenhagen, Denmark, 3rd] According to news from Berlin, the German government has proposed to the Nordic countries that they sign mutual guarantees with Germany. Government officials have formally begun negotiations with Germany, but the content of the negotiations has not yet been announced. It is believed that the governments of the Nordic countries are currently carefully studying this issue with each other.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] According to a correspondent from the "Exchange Telegraph Mail" in the Swedish capital, people close to the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm said that the news reported by a Berlin correspondent of the Swedish newspaper "Millingen" that the Nordic countries will conduct negotiations with Germany to sign mutual guarantees is an exaggeration. Only Sweden may be slightly involved, as Germany has instructed its ambassador to Sweden to solicit the Swedish government's opinion on signing a guarantee treaty, but the government will not make any statement until it has held talks with the Nordic countries. These sources also said that this guarantee treaty can only be a non-aggression pact.</p>
<h3>Italian King Sends Telegram to Egypt; Expresses Friendly Attitude; Egypt Said to Support Italian Demands; Italian-Romanian Talks Have Concluded</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] According to reliable sources, Italian King Vittorio Emanuele III has sent a telegram to Egyptian King Farouk, expressing the Italian government's desire to respect Egypt's integrity. The telegram also expressed Italy's friendly intentions towards Egypt. It is believed here that this guarantee from Italy to Egypt is to obtain Egypt's support for Italy's request to participate in the management of the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held his final consultations with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this evening and is scheduled to return home on May 5. Gafencu held talks with Mussolini on May 1 for more than two hours. Political circles here hope that Romania's attitude towards the German-Italian axis can be the same as Yugoslavia's, and that a non-aggression pact can be concluded with Hungary.</p>
<h3>Portugal Awards King of England Honorary Cross Medal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lisbon, 2nd] The President of Portugal has recently awarded the Portuguese Honorary Cross Medal, the highest order in Portugal, to King George VI of England, and issued a public announcement stating, "This award represents the long-standing friendship between England and Portugal, and the goodwill of the Portuguese people towards the British people." It should be noted that only the President holds the Honorary Cross Medal in Portugal.</p>
<h3>German Immigrants in England Engaging in Nazi Activities; Many Deported</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British Home Office has recently submitted to the German Embassy a list of German immigrants in England who are related to Nazi organizations in England and have been ordered to leave the country. These include Karl Wawe, the leader of a Nazi political organization in England, Himmemann, the leader of the London district of the organization, Holloff, the head of the German travel agency in England (who has now left England), Raush, a reporter for the "National Gazette," the newspaper of General Goering, Glirichi, a socialite, and journalists were not expelled for journalistic activities. The reasons for expulsion were purely for engaging in Nazi activities. It is believed that the number of those expelled is quite large. As for the estimate of 50 people being expelled, as reported in the evening newspapers, it is somewhat exaggerated.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Two Chambers to Hold Secret Meeting; Discuss Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's Consultations with Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 3rd] The Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were received by Regent Horthy at 11:00 this morning to hear reports on consultations with the German government in Berlin.

According to official announcements, the two Hungarian political leaders held separate talks with Hitler, Ribbentrop, Goering, and Nazi Deputy Leader Hess, discussing all issues related to the two countries and the European political situation. The Hungarian government's visit to Germany has immeasurable value for enhancing the friendship between the two countries. Political circles here also believe that the important result of this meeting is that Hungary and its southern neighbors will soon establish a friendship agreement and that the southern country will join the Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>

<h3>Irish Opposes Extension of British Conscription to Northern Ireland; Northern Ireland Prime Minister Expresses Loyalty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] In the Military Training Bill, there are separate treatments for Northern Ireland and other parts of the Empire. The Irish MPs in the Lower House have decided to oppose this point.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Irish Free State President Eamon de Valera said in Parliament today that he has protested to the British government against the extension of the British government's conscription system to Northern Ireland in certain circumstances. The Irish government denies Britain the right to conscript in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland is part of Ireland. The opposition party also supports the government's position. Professor O'Sullivan said that this action by the British government is difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon met with British Prime Minister Chamberlain for half an hour, saying that he had repeatedly stated that he was prepared to hand over all of Northern Ireland's manpower and financial resources to the Imperial government, and said that he had asked the Imperial government how Northern Ireland people could show their loyalty to their motherland, and was awaiting the Imperial government's decision.</p>

<h3>European Anti-Aggression, Negotiating the Chen Line, Britain and the Soviet Union Continue to Study Good Strategies, Britain Hopes for Cooperation among Balkan Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The British Cabinet held its weekly meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning and discussed the negotiations with the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to establish a tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union with military conditions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European anti-aggression front is still being studied by the British side. However, the number of countries involved in the Anglo-Soviet talks is very large, so it is not possible to obtain the best solution in the short term. According to reports from various newspapers here, the Soviet Union advocates that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can form a firm alliance and repeatedly provide guarantees. The British side, on the other hand, believes that a kind of agreement should be established by various countries. The method of providing joint assistance to various countries does not need to be specifically stipulated, but can be decided by the countries themselves. Britain trusts that all Balkan countries (including Bulgaria) can cooperate harmoniously.</p>

The Prime Minister had previously stated that the negotiating parties would make various proposals to each other, and discussions are still continuing. He reiterated that as soon as there is a slight breakthrough, he will make a formal report to the House of Commons. Regarding the "Times" report that the government intends to limit the nature of the agreement and proposals made by the Soviet Union, Chamberlain said that he still hopes that the people will wait for an official statement to gain confidence.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The "News Chronicle" here published the results of a British public opinion poll today, saying that 80 percent of Britons would agree to establish a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and 72 percent of Britons would support establishing military guarantees with small countries.</p>
<p>Anglo-Romanian Economic Negotiations Stalled</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Grand Union of the Drama World</h3>
<p>The famous play "Huanghuagang," a joint grand performance by the entire Hong Kong drama community, premiered at the Taiping Theatre last night and will continue to be performed for the next two evenings.</p>
<p>We express our utmost joy and importance to this performance of the famous play "Huanghuagang." The main reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>First, "Huanghuagang" is a great revolutionary historical drama that reflects the ideology of the early Ming Chinese national revolution. Although our national revolution has now entered a new stage, the experiences and lessons left to us by the revolutionary martyrs still need to be universally and conscientiously accepted. How to make these historical facts, experiences, and lessons universally recognized, understood, and absorbed by the public is one of the main tasks of the current drama community. The performance of "Huanghuagang" clearly has its pioneering significance.</p>
<p>Second, this performance is hosted by the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Association, and the funds raised will be fully allocated to the Fallen Soldiers' Dependents Relief Fund. This is not only a pioneering initiative in Hong Kong, but also has its scale of significance in China and even overseas. We must know that to win the Anti-Japanese War, we must rely on the enhancement of frontline combat effectiveness. It is imperative to ensure the livelihood of the soldiers' families, so that they can fight at the front with peace of mind. In the future success of nation-building, we must rely on the cultivation of a vast new force. Establishing a relief fund for the dependents of fallen soldiers is one of the primary tasks in cultivating the future new force, and should also be regarded as an important task of the current overseas Chinese community.</p>
<p>But what is particularly important is the third point, that is, this performance involves more than 30 theater troupes, mobilizing more than 500 actors. This is not only an unprecedented event in Hong Kong, but also unprecedented in China. In particular, it demonstrates the unprecedented grand union of the Hong Kong drama community. In addition to encouraging the actors and theater troupes participating in this union to go one step further, we should further consolidate and develop the united front of the Hong Kong drama community, so that the Hong Kong drama and cultural movement can have further development.</p>

<h3>Amidst Strengthening of the Anti-Aggression Front, Soviet Fleet to Visit Hong Kong, First Time in 25 Years, Comprising Four Ships including Destroyers and Submarines, Will Arrive in Hong Kong within This Week from a Certain Place after Visiting Manila for Ten Days</h3>
<p>It has been 25 years since a Soviet fleet has visited Hong Kong since the Russo-Japanese War. According to a reporter's investigation, a Soviet fleet, including a new destroyer, a submarine, and three mine-laying ships, a total of four ships, will arrive in Little Luzon this Saturday and will then sail to Hong Kong for a visit after a short stay. It is reported that the Hong Kong authorities will give them a warm welcome. Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Memel by Germany and the conquest of Albania by Italy, the world situation has become increasingly dangerous. Britain and France are trying to save the critical situation, inviting the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Greece, and other countries to form an anti-aggression front, and adopting a grand encirclement against Italy and Germany. Amidst the strengthening of this anti-aggression front, the sudden arrival of the Soviet fleet is undoubtedly of great importance to the world. Since 1915, Russia has not had warships visiting Hong Kong. After the Soviet regime came to power, they changed the flag to the hammer and sickle, and warships with this flag have never been seen in Hong Kong (only merchant ships have flown it in recent years), so this can be said to be the first time. It is reported that the fleet coming east this time consists of four ships: (1) the "Most Jia" (加) , which is a submarine tender, weighing 740 tons, built in 1937; (2) the "Yu Jia" (域加) , which is a torpedo destroyer, also 740 tons, carrying 50 mines; (3) "Ba La" (巴刺); (4) "Ji Su" (急蘇), both of which are mine-laying ships, but their tonnage is unknown. According to the current schedule, they will arrive in Manila from a certain place on Saturday and will sail to Hong Kong 12 days later. The Hong Kong naval authorities have received this message, but have not yet formally received a notice from the Soviet side. According to usual procedures, foreign fleets must notify at least one week in advance before arriving in Hong Kong. It has also been found that in recent years, the Soviet Union has been vigorously strengthening its military preparations in the Far East. In addition to the powerful army and air force, the force stationed in Vladivostok is also quite alarming, especially the power of submarines, which often makes Japan uneasy. It is not yet known whether the fleet will be stationed in Vladivostok after cruising various ports in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Macau Water and Electricity Company Agrees to Reduce Water and Electricity Fees to Facilitate Investment by Hong Kong Manufacturers</h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong Manufacturers Association visited Macau and returned to Hong Kong, they had a very good impression of the place. After careful consideration, the manufacturers all intend to set up branch factories in Macau. However, the factories set up consume a lot of electricity and water. Without the local electricity and water companies slightly reducing the electricity and water fees, they would not dare to proceed lightly. Therefore, the Manufacturers Association specifically wrote to the Macau electricity and water companies to request a reduction, and received a reply yesterday agreeing to support the proposal. Last month, the Manufacturers Association's inspection team visited Macau, and the association and its members donated a total of approximately HK$2,000 in charity funds to build refugee schools and subsidize the expenses of the Immaculate Conception Children's Handicraft Institute. A letter of thanks was also received yesterday.</p>
<h3>Kowloon Landlords Obstruct Tenants from Making Air Defense Equipment, Residents Plan to Ask Hong Kong Government to Enact Laws Authorizing Construction, Insufficient Kowloon Police Affects Residents' Safety</h3>
<p>The Kowloon Residents Association has decided to hold a general meeting of members once per quarter. All members can participate and express their opinions. The first meeting was held yesterday on the 2nd at the St. Andrew's Church in Kowloon. Many matters were resolved during the meeting. The committee members present that day included Chairman Mintz, Vice Chairman She Ming, Secretary Luo Xian, Pastor He Lu, etc. A member proposed that if a member has any opinions to express, if it does not hinder the implementation of the matter, it is appropriate not to make their name public. This was immediately resolved and passed. A resident named He Youtian proposed that the government should allow the residents of Ho Man Tin to build water closets themselves. It was resolved that the government should be urged again. Regarding the issue of insufficient Kowloon inspectors, which affects public safety, Chairman Guan Cheng said that he had sent a letter to the police to appeal for strengthening the Kowloon inspector force. Austin Road complained that the sounds of taxis and buses disturbed them at night and prevented them from sleeping, and requested to negotiate with the Transport Department. The horns of private cars are especially harsh. The chairman replied that the association had repeatedly complained to the Transport Department, but unexpectedly, the old habits have recently resurfaced. As for the problem of private car horns, they can negotiate with the Automobile Association. A member proposed that regarding tenants building air defense shelters or shelters, they are often obstructed by landlords, which is contrary to the government's original intention of promoting air defense plans. He requested the association to submit a new air defense law to the government, allowing tenants to build various air defense equipment in the rented houses. The chairman replied that it is not difficult to negotiate directly with the landlord to slightly renovate the house. The association will consider this matter carefully.</p>

<h3>An Unprecedented Contribution from Hong Kong's Theatrical Community: "Huanghuagang" Premiered Last Night</h3>
<p>— Kee Cheuk</p>
<p>Excellent Results, Enthusiastic Atmosphere, Performances Continue Tonight and Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>The highly anticipated great revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang" finally premiered last night at the Tai Ping Theatre before thousands of people. The unprecedented unity, unprecedented effort, and unprecedented contribution of the Hong Kong spoken drama community created a landmark record last night. This glorious historical page reflects the countless thoughts and spilled blood of so many people. Here, we should first pay the highest respect of national liberation to the hundreds of enthusiastic workers behind the scenes and on the organizing committee!</p>
<p>In this heated, tense scene, the most interesting place was backstage:</p>
<p>Actors, staff, props... filled the spacious backstage. Under the arrangement of makeup masters like Lee King-po, Keung Ming, and Tong Suk-ming, revolutionary patriots, old Qing officials, sedan carriers, and Qing soldiers were all transformed. She laughed at his queue looking like a pig's tail. He laughed at her embroidered dress looking like some kind of billboard! Some mumbled their lines, others practiced their stage movements with gestures and dances. The stagehands and electricians were all in lively work clothes, busily working tirelessly. "Division of labor and cooperation" and "no matter too small" were fully demonstrated in practice. There were also "large lanterns," "large dragon flags," and road signs saying "Silence! Avoidance!" ... What a set of feudal antiques, what despicable dregs of progress, heartbreaking national humiliation,</p>
<p>Inevitably evoking endless emotion!</p>
<p>Mr. Woo Chun-bing, the stage manager, was one of the most hardworking leaders. He said, "For the past half month, everything else has been put aside; the only thing we've been doing is preparing for the premiere of 'Huanghuagang.'" His complexion looked very tired, but his spirit was still very excited. Just like Mr. Au-Yeung Yu-qian, this is the cause they entrust their spirit to, this is the joy of their lives.</p>
<p>Mr. Au-Yeung said, "Joint performances are really troublesome; but once you start doing it, you can taste the real flavor."</p>
<p>After touring backstage, I took a walk around the three floors of the theater. The second floor was the most crowded, the third floor was mostly occupied by the choir, but there were still many empty seats in the main hall, showing that many upper-class people were still aloof, and that supporting the families of fallen soldiers had nothing to do with them. This is not necessarily an outline of Hong Kong society.</p>
<p>At 7:30, the magnificent singing voice, accompanied by bugles, shook the entire venue. Mr. Lau Ying directed with exceptional liveliness and power, because more than 20 choral groups, hundreds of choristers, were also, like the spoken drama, united on an unprecedented scale. The first song was the national anthem, and the entire audience stood in solemn tribute. "May 31," "May Fourth," "May 51"—what days they were! Sensitive overseas compatriots were moved again. The second was the "Huanghuagang Song," "... ""Who can bear to say goodbye to parents and wives and children forever?"" ... For the freedom and liberation of the nation, we vow to bury our white bones in Huanghuagang ""..."" "May the 450 million compatriots rise together" ... "" Every sentence touched people's hearts. Then came many more patriotic songs, deeply wishing that our dear compatriots would cherish the enthusiastic mood and initiate practical work.</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock sharp, "Huanghuagang" opened amid thunderous applause.</p>
<p>The scenery outside the East Gate of Guangzhou was very realistic, and the hawkers selling peanuts and sugar cane were lifelike, giving the audience a sense of fun first. Once the main plot unfolded, it was very passionate and very solemn.</p>
<p>The ugliness of the Manchu Qing Dynasty made people's teeth itch. Wen Shengcai assassinated Li Zhun, but he ran out of bullets and was captured. It was not Li Zhun who died, but Fu Qi. The heroic words, "Killing one more traitor, one more Manchu slave, will rid China of one more pest," aroused thunderous applause from the audience. Martyr Wen's calm spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness is a typical patriotic martyr of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>After the prologue came the first act. The scenery was the secret headquarters of the revolutionary party, where female comrades were working enthusiastically, and some revolutionary comrades were waiting for Huang Keqiang to arrive. Although the Manchu Qing dogs came to search, they were fortunately dealt with. Mrs. Lin Juemin came from afar to visit her husband, but for the sake of revolutionary work, she overcame her feelings with reason and avoided meeting him.</p>
<p>As soon as Huang Keqiang—played by Dun—arrived, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. The determination to either succeed or die moved many revolutionary comrades. However, certain vacillating elements were annoying. Taking the past as a lesson, there are inevitably cowards, short-sighted people, and selfish people parasitizing in any group. One day will be the end of their doom.</p>
<p>The interweaving of love between Huang Keqiang and his lover Xu Zonghan—played by Au Oi—warmed the solemn atmosphere. However, they were not lovers of love-supremacism, but love as a means of revolutionary assistance. This is not necessarily an inspiration for young men and women to have a correct view of love.</p>
<p>The scenery in the second act was the Western-style hall inside the Governor-General's Yamen of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the decorations were very gorgeous. Zhang Mingqi—played by Cheung Chik-sun—looked very much like a Manchu slave showing off his stinking airs. Keung Ming played a servant, although "heroes have no place to use their talents." But his actions were enough to make people laugh. Zhang's concubine—played by To Chuk-wan—'s flirting and charming demeanor also enlivened the plot. What this scene shows is that Zhang Mingqi "is wondering why the revolutionaries can't be captured and killed completely," the so-called "wild grass cannot be burned out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again."</p>
<p>The location of the third act is another revolutionary base, and the time is the night before "March 29." Many male and female comrades were carrying ammunition, actively preparing for the uprising. "Even if this time fails, the impact on the general public will be indelible"; "Whoever is afraid of sacrifice is not worthy of being a revolutionary"; "We want to complete this glorious page of history"; "The time has come to the final juncture; if we don't succeed, we will become martyrs." The revolutionaries encourage and influence each other. A good example is presented to overseas compatriots.</p>
<p>The fourth act is when Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun interrogate the revolutionaries Chen Meixin and Rao Guoying in the Governor-General's Office. The revolutionaries attack and the scene is very tense. Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun flee in a hurry, and their embarrassed situation causes half the audience to laugh coldly. However, because our strength was insufficient, the seventy-two martyrs sacrificed heroically! But at the same time, the revolutionary sparks all over the country spread even more widely.</p>
<p>This failure is the mother of the eleventh success. The final scene shows the success of the Wuchang Uprising in October of the same year, and the Republic of China was established! The seventy-two martyrs are smiling in the afterlife!</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years later, on "March 29," our compatriots hold a memorial meeting in Huanghuagang.</p>
<p>"Dear compatriots and comrades, after twenty-two months of national self-defense and resistance, we have progressed to a new and critical stage. To accelerate the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we must exhaust our own abilities and thoroughly fulfill the missions that the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and Dr. Sun Yat-sen entrusted to us! A new China is about to be reborn. The spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs will never die! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the Republic of China!"</p>
<p>Right at 12 o'clock that night, amidst the extreme tension and the thunderous applause of thousands of audience members, the curtain fell. Tonight and tomorrow night, come and appreciate the most progressive theatrical art and receive the baptism of the revolution! This is too rare an opportunity.</p>

<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Ho Chau</p>
<p>The life insurance business has only been around for over fifty years in China. Initially, foreign companies established branches in China to attract Chinese business, with annual profits flowing out unchecked. It wasn't until the first year of the Republic of China that Chinese people organized their own companies. However, due to the lack of public awareness, it failed to attract the attention of the society for a time. After more than ten years, Chinese-run companies were established again. Until recently, in the past seven or eight years, several more have been successively established, but the number is still no more than ten. Compared with the three hundred in the United States, there is a world of difference. And now, it is inevitably affected by the war, suffering considerable setbacks.</p>
<p>The purpose of life insurance is to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, to protect the livelihood of the family after death, so that there is no fear of hunger or cold. Life is full of dangers, which can happen anytime, anywhere. This is especially evident in these troubled times. If preparations are not made early, there will be regret. Therefore, life insurance should be purchased during peacetime, and even more so during wartime. People who love their families should purchase life insurance, and people who love their country should purchase life insurance from Chinese-funded companies to reclaim economic rights. Life insurance companies collect the small premiums paid by policyholders and accumulate them into huge sums, which are then used to invest in various businesses and develop national resources. The country becomes rich and the people benefit, truly relying on it. This is the motivation for editing and publishing this journal.</p>
<p>This journal is deeply grateful to all circles at home and abroad for their generous contributions of excellent articles. However, due to the limited space, we are unable to publish all of them in the first issue, and we sincerely apologize. The preparation time for this journal was extremely short, and it was rushed to print, so errors and omissions are inevitable. We hope that readers will point them out, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Life Insurance and National Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Wong Wan-yuk</p>
<p>I. The Significance of Life Insurance</p>
<p>Life insurance is the most appropriate method of preparing for the family's living expenses after death. The vast majority of our families rely on the daily income of the head of the household to maintain their livelihood. If the head of the household is well and the income remains unchanged, then the family can live comfortably without fear of hunger or cold. However, if the head of the household encounters an unforeseen event one day, the family will lose their support, and poverty after death is inevitable. This is why there is such a thing as "the family has no reserve grain, and the young daughter cries for food." However, the use of life insurance is not to ensure that the insured does not die, but to ensure that after the insured's death, the family can receive the insurance amount from the life insurance company to maintain their livelihood and prevent them from falling into destitution. Therefore, life insurance embodies the spirit of mutual assistance among human beings, uniting people with similar risks and sharing the economic losses that arise among them.</p>
<p>II. Life Insurance and National Economic Construction</p>
<p>The benefit of life insurance to families is the greatest purpose of life insurance, and this is known to all who have even a little common sense. But from the point of view of the national economy, its benefits are even greater. Here are the main points, divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>(1) It can encourage savings. The accumulation of capital depends on the thrift and savings of the majority of the population. There are many ways to encourage national thrift and savings, but life insurance is one of the most effective. Ordinary savings are generally based on a laissez-faire principle, while life insurance savings have a compulsory nature. Therefore, the extent to which life insurance can encourage national thrift and savings is actually greater than other methods. If the people of a country mostly enjoy life insurance, then there must be more savers, and if there are more savers, the national capital can be concentrated. From a negative point of view, it is enough to make policyholders feel at ease and have no worries, encouraging them to move forward bravely and cultivate a national spirit of enterprise; from a positive point of view, it can also increase individual credit for food and clothing and move towards a path of common prosperity.</p>
<p>(2) It can stabilize enterprises. In partnerships, dissolution is often forced by the death of a partner; even in corporations, the death of an important officer often has an impact. These are all drawbacks of not having insurance. If the partners have life insurance, then if a partner dies, the other surviving partners can receive the insurance money from the life insurance company, allowing the partnership to turn from danger to safety. Important company officers such as managers and engineers are of utmost importance to a company, and insurance should be taken out for them to prevent accidental losses. If such important officers are still alive after insurance is taken out, it is naturally a blessing for the company; if they unfortunately die, the company will receive a huge amount of insurance money to compensate for the loss.</p>
<p>In addition, if creditworthy officers often serve as intangible guarantors for the company's borrowing or bond issuance, then their survival or death is also of great importance to the company. If the company takes out insurance for them or does so when issuing bonds, then its creditworthiness will naturally be strengthened. Also, when money is particularly tight, the company lacks funds, and commercial borrowing is difficult, which has a great impact on the company. However, if the company's important officers have previously taken out life insurance, the company can use this policy to mortgage a loan from the life insurance company, so there is no need to worry about being unable to make ends meet. Company officers taking out life insurance can also make them feel at ease and dedicated to their careers, and they will not be tempted to change jobs. This is not only beneficial to the officers themselves but also to the company, because labor disputes can also be resolved accordingly. If this is the case, then the stability of the enterprise will have a significant benefit to the national economy.</p>
<p>(3) It can develop national wealth. The development of the life insurance business means that more and more people are taking out life insurance. As a result, insurance companies collect the small premiums paid by policyholders, and with many a little makes a mickle, they accumulate huge amounts of capital, which are used to develop national resources, invest in industry, and develop the national economy. The country becomes rich and the people benefit, truly relying on it. According to the end of 1926, the 52 life insurance companies in the United States had a total of 11,876,000,000 yuan in assets, of which 5,083,000,000 yuan was invested in mortgage loans, 4,536,000,000 yuan was invested in bonds and stocks, and 2,257,000,000 yuan was invested in other loans. It is known that the national economy of the United States is so developed, and it has benefited greatly from the investment of life insurance companies.</p>
<p>(4) It can subsidize finance. Life insurance companies absorb policyholder premiums, because their maturity period is always long-term in nature, such as ten, twenty, or thirty years. Therefore, they can often make long-term investments in life insurance reserves, and they can absorb large amounts of public debt issued by the central and local governments, whether in peacetime or wartime. For example, during the Russo-Japanese War and the European War, the insurance companies were the ones who recognized the most public debt issued by Japan and other countries. From this, it can be seen that the funds absorbed by life insurance companies benefit the national economy and subsidize national finances, and they can truly be compared with the banking industry.</p>
<p>(5) It can strengthen the nation. All those who take out life insurance must undergo a physical examination, and people's diseases often develop silently and are painful because they are not aware of them. After the examination, they will naturally pay attention to health care to protect their lives. Over time, this will become a habit, and the strength of the nation will be based on this. Labor is the most important factor of production, and national health is the foundation of labor. Therefore, if we want to develop the national economy, then strengthening the nation is essential.</p>
<p>III. Conclusion</p>
<p>The close relationship between the life insurance business and national economic construction has been popular in European and American countries for a long time, and has achieved results early. However, this system has only been around for over fifty years in China, and because public awareness is not high and promotion is weak, progress has been very slow. At this time of national crisis, economic construction is the top priority. The life insurance business is one aspect of economic construction, and it should be promoted urgently. On an individual level, because the wartime risk is greater, the need for insurance is more urgent. On the government level, judging from the current economic situation, due to the huge war costs, if we want to talk about construction, in addition to borrowing foreign debt, we must also rely on national thrift and savings, and insurance is the most effective way to save. Regarding national economic construction and thrift methods, the National Economic Construction Movement and the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang have detailed regulations, which will not be repeated here. This article only briefly elaborates on the life insurance aspect.</p>
<h3>Prevention Methods for Common Summer Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheung Shiu-tung</p>
<p>There are many common summer diseases, and most of them enter through the mouth. In summer, the weather is very hot, and most people like to eat raw and cold foods and water that has not been boiled, which leads to various diseases. In Hong Kong, countless people die every year from infections of this kind of disease. Here are some common summer diseases, their causes, prevention methods, and treatment methods, so that readers know what to be careful about.</p>
<p>I. Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>Cause: This disease is caused by a bacterium. It is transmitted through the ingestion of water mixed with the feces and urine of patients with this disease, or through the use of river water used to wash their feces and urine, or through wearing clothes of patients that have not been disinfected, or through transmission by flies.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Initially, general fatigue, loss of appetite, aversion to employment, headache, insomnia. Initially, chills, followed by fever. In the first week, the body temperature gradually increases in a stepwise manner, rising to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. In the second week, the temperature reaches its peak, often remaining around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. In the third week, it shows a slight degree of variation and gradually decreases. By the fourth week, the variations are obvious, and the fever subsides.</p>
<p>The pulse is slower in relation to the temperature.</p>
<p>The tongue is coated with a thick, grayish-white fur and is dry.</p>
<p>Constipation is common at the onset of the disease.</p>
<p>The complications of this disease are intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation, which often occur in the third week.</p>
<p>Treatment: Lie flat and rest quietly, avoid eating solid foods, and give milk soup, etc., while the doctor prescribes treatment according to the symptoms.</p>
<p>Prevention: Prevention shots can be given, once a week for a total of three shots, which can prevent the disease for approximately up to September.</p>
<p>II. Cholera</p>
<p>Cause: Caused by a bacterium that invades the digestive organs. The causes of transmission are unclean food and clothing.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Initially, abdominal tightness and a feeling of bowel movement, followed by the discharge of thin, liquid stools, thirst, gastrocnemius muscle tenderness, and cold extremities.</p>
<p>This disease often leads to death in one or two days, but it can also enter a recovery period. Vomiting and diarrhea gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Treatment: Lie flat and rest quietly, use only liquid foods, and the treatment often involves injecting saline solution into the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Prevention: Cholera vaccination can be given.</p>
<p>III. Dysentery</p>
<p>Cause: Caused by dysentery bacteria. In tropical areas, it is caused by a type of amoeba, called amoebic dysentery. Eating unripe fruits and any unhygienic diet can easily cause this disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Frequent bowel movements, tenesmus, combined with abdominal pain and rumbling. Each bowel movement is small in quantity and contains mucus and blood.</p>
<p>The complications of this disease are liver abscesses, and the important sequelae are intestinal stenosis.</p>
<p>Treatment: Lie flat and rest quietly. If it is bacillary dysentery, injecting horse serum can be expected to lead to early recovery. If it is amoebic dysentery, injecting emetine twice can cure it.</p>
<p>The above are the most common and easily transmitted diseases in summer. As for other vomiting and diarrhea diseases, there are many. The most important thing is to be very careful about food in summer. Do not eat food that has not been cooked, do not drink water that has not been boiled, and all foods must be moderate to avoid transmission by flies.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Basketball Battle: Group A Star Island Defeats Eastern, Group B Spring Grass Wins Over Pui Ying</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special) Last night, the YMCA gymnasium was packed with men and women, creating quite a lively scene. The general purpose of the crowd was to watch the highly anticipated Group A basketball game between Star Island and Eastern, as this match had significant implications for the championship's future, making it particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>In the first game, Group B Spring Grass faced Taikoo, putting on a show with plenty of highlights and a decent atmosphere. Ultimately, Spring Grass had better coordination and consistently held the advantage, securing a 48-31 victory.</p>
<p>Next, the Group A match between Star Island and Eastern was the most anticipated event for the audience. With the stakes of winning and losing being high, both sides played with all their might, making the game intense and captivating.</p>
<p>The Star Island players were all "products" of the gymnasium, with polished moves and excellent coordination. Their attacks under the basket were particularly fierce, allowing them to maintain the lead throughout the game, ultimately defeating Eastern.</p>
<p>Star Island's success stemmed from their effective coordination and accurate shooting. Each player's assigned position was both quick and responsive, allowing them to consistently score under the basket.</p>
<p>While Eastern's individual skills were certainly good, their teamwork was lacking. They handled the ball well in the mid-court, but became helpless under the basket. Even Xu Heng, traditionally known for his skill in scoring under the basket, was unable to showcase his talent due to a lack of support when penetrating the defense. In short, Eastern secured very few opportunities to score under the basket.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when players ran into position, they focused too much on marking opponents, neglecting opportunities for a clear shot. Although they often had chances to penetrate the defense, they lacked the agility to capitalize, missing out on opportunities to turn and shoot. This technique was completely absent throughout the game. While this could be attributed to Star Island's tight defense, Eastern's weakness in finding opportunities was evident to everyone in the audience.</p>
<p>Among the Eastern team, Feng Nianhua scored the most points, proving to be a true powerhouse. He was also cunning, cleverly drawing fouls. His actions easily deceived the audience. Upon gaining possession, he would charge forward at the first sign of an opening. Seeing him rush towards them, opposing defenders would invariably step out to intercept him, only to fall into his trap and commit a foul. As seen in the score sheet, Feng's many points were a result of this tactic.</p>
<p>However, victory in basketball doesn't rely solely on individual skill, but on teamwork. While Feng's individual skills were excellent, Eastern's teamwork couldn't compare to Star Island's refined coordination, leading to their defeat. The final score was 40 to 47.</p>
<p>In the final game, Group B Pui Ying faced South China. Pui Ying showed rapid improvement, creating numerous opportunities. Huang Yaohua, Guan Zhenbin, and Chen Xiyang were particularly active, leading Pui Ying to overpower South China with a score of 32-22. The score sheet for the Group A game is listed below:</p>
<p>Eastern Team: Shot / Penalty / Foul / Points</p>
<p>Feng Nianhua: 5 / 8 / 2 / 18</p>
<p>Luo Ji'an: 1 / 0 / 1 / 2</p>
<p>Xu Heng: 4 / 0 / 3 / 8</p>
<p>Huang Dingfen: 2 / 1 / 4 / 5</p>
<p>Chen Zongqi: 2 / 3 / 3 / 7</p>
<p>Sun Shiqing: 0 / 0 / 2 / 0</p>
<p>(Total: 40)</p>
<p>Star Island Team: Shot / Penalty / Record / Points</p>
<p>Li Peiyan: 3 / 0 / 2 / 6</p>
<p>Li Shijie: 1 / 0 / 1 / 2</p>
<p>Xing Zhongjian: 3 / 0 / 1 / 6</p>
<p>Dai Fucheng: 6 / 2 / 4 / 14</p>
<p>Zhong Zhiqiang: 2 / 2 / 0 / 6</p>
<p>Lu Zhenxuan: 1 / 0 / 4 / 2</p>
<p>Liang Guoze: 2 / 0 / 2 / 4</p>
<p>Pan Yaojun: 0 / 0 / 1 / 0</p>
<p>Li Peichi: 3 / 1 / 2 / 7</p>
<h3>Today's Lawn Tennis: Doubles Semi-Finals - He Jialiu and Li Rurong vs. Lin Zhen Brothers</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special) The Open Lawn Tennis Tournament will feature a doubles semi-final match at the Hong Kong Cricket Club grounds today at 4:30 PM, pitting He Jialiu and Li Rurong against the Lin Zhen brothers. He is a veteran of the tennis world, with extensive experience. He has been practicing diligently recently, and his skills have gradually returned to their former glory. His strength is also quite abundant. Therefore, he has been making good contributions to the competition. Since teaming up with Li for doubles, they have been victorious in every match, earning the right to the semi-finals. This is no lucky coincidence. Today, they will face the Lin Zhen brothers. If they win, they will secure a spot in the finals, where they will compete against the Xu brothers for the championship. A loss will mean the end of their journey, with all their previous efforts wasted. Faced with this critical juncture, He and Li are determined to fight hard. However, whether they can win remains uncertain, as the Lin Zhen brothers are leaders in doubles, with exceptional skills. Currently, aside from the Xu brothers, no one can defeat them. Although He and Li are determined to win and are encouraging each other in the face of a formidable opponent, hoping that their efforts will yield good results, the Lin Zhen brothers are technically superior and have better teamwork. Therefore, the reporter believes that it will not be easy for He and Li to win. However, we sincerely hope that they can achieve their goals and complete the great feat of Chinese players sweeping both the championship and runner-up positions in doubles. But such an idealistic outcome may not be realized. Facing such a strong team today is likely to bring more bad luck than good. If they can overcome this difficult hurdle, it will be truly commendable. (Dong Lang)</p>
<h3>Macao Football Team to Visit Hong Kong This Weekend to Battle Eastern, Jiang Shanqing Still Plays for Eastern</h3>
<p>The Macao Interport Football Team, having recently lost to the Hong Kong team, remains ambitious and plans to visit Hong Kong this weekend to play against Eastern. The match is scheduled to start at 4:30 PM this Sunday. It is sure to be a fierce and exciting contest. The events leading up to this match started when veteran footballer Jiang Shanqing came to Hong Kong last weekend to play for Eastern. He discussed the possibility of Eastern being invited to Macao for a match with Shi Zuixi, a key member of Eastern. Before the Eastern away team departed, the Macao Football Association sent a letter of invitation. This matter was already under discussion. At the time Jiang came to Hong Kong, Eastern suggested that the Macao team could come to Hong Kong first. After Jiang returned to Macao, he reported Eastern's suggestion to the Macao Football Association. Eastern received a letter from the Macao Football Association yesterday morning, stating their decision to send a team to Hong Kong for a match, and listing the team's lineup as follows:</p>
<p>Jia Hualue, Luo Bado, He Zuosheng, Ke Tuohua, Yaluoshu, Sousa, Xiao Luobi, Ya Maiming, Huali Lu, Gao Lasu (Captain), Li Ji</p>
<p>Reserves: Liu Diqing, Ba Da Laige</p>
<p>This team is full of strength, and the forward Gao Lasu is particularly skilled. He played as a center-back in the interport match, but this time he will play as a right-winger, posing a threat to Eastern. Although Eastern is currently missing Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, and Miao Huaguo, who have returned to Shanghai, and Hou Chengtuo, who has gone to the Philippines and has not yet returned, there is still no shortage of talent, and the team remains strong. The lineup for the upcoming match has not yet been officially decided, but Jiang Shanqing is determined to play for Eastern, and many players have volunteered. The official lineup will be announced in the next few days. According to the Macao Football Association, the team is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the morning of Sunday via the X'ian liner, arriving around noon (11:15 AM). Eastern has decided to send someone to welcome them, showing the hospitality of the hosts.</p>

The foreign sailors were repeatedly taken advantage of and lost 3-1.</p>
<p>The foreign sailors' teamwork was uncoordinated, repeatedly leading to wasted efforts. The forward, 列比, proved to be skilled, and the 特架 defense was effective. 烈厘 was also courageous, but the rest of the players had little to offer.</p>
<p>South China's Yang Shuiyi and Ye Beihua were more active. Li Guowei and Tan Zhen　 were also likable. Lu Dakeng's progression and passing seemed slow. The newcomer Zhang Jinhai was quite suitable.</p>
<p>The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. In the second half, South China scored two more goals, ending the game with a score of 3-1. The scorers were Yang Shuiyi and Zhang Jinhai, with one goal being an own goal by 衣利士.</p>

<h3>A Dedication for Youth Day</h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>Youth is the driving force for China's rebirth.</p>
<p>In this vast land of 34.9 million square miles, when it was as silent as a dead sea, and millions groaned under oppression and cruelty, youth, with a spirit of no looking back, stirred up a surging wave, flying like petrels. They pointed out the bright path to the masses; when they ignited the flames of revolution, experiencing a fierce battle, youth, with the greatest strength, raised a banner of combat, acting as a bugler, sounding the charge for the slaves of the semi-colony.</p>
<p>Youth is the driving force for China's rebirth. In every great political movement, cultural movement, and ideological movement in modern Chinese history, youth has dedicated their strength, fulfilling the arduous tasks of initiation, leadership, and support. The history of each movement is infused with the cries of youth, the spirit of youth, and the blood of youth. The places where youth can gather are abundant.</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement initiated a new birth of Chinese culture, and the youth's blow to the traitors was like the first ray of sunlight piercing through the darkness at sunrise. The May Thirtieth Movement unveiled the prelude to the Great Chinese Revolution, and the youth, with large-scale demonstrations and fresh blood, enriched and punctuated the glorious history of this movement. The Great Revolution of 1926-27 rolled the most intense flames across the Chinese wilderness. Youth became the strong backbone of the army and the vanguard of the mass movement, initiating the practical and genuine revolution. In the December Ninth Movement of 1935, youth, in coordination with the burgeoning national unity, raised high the spirit of the student movement, enduring water cannons, leather whips, and iron rulers, to awaken the masses and pave the way to a united front. After August 13th, what significant tasks have the youth undertaken, and how many astonishing achievements have they created? The facts are all there, and there is no need to waste ink on narration. This driving force for China's rebirth will, with the most mighty torrents and the most magnificent waves, wash away all the filth and obstruction, and establish even greater achievements than before.</p>
<p>Today is Youth Day. The young generation of China must cherish their history, piously accept the instructions of the highest authorities and the highest leaders, and the expectations of the national masses and international friends, to carry out work more broadly and practically, and to accomplish the tasks of battle.</p>
<p>Our young generation must not have the slightest complacency. We must admit that our achievements are not yet perfect, and that the work we need to do is infinitely more. Now is just the beginning. The thorns ahead need us to cut them down, and countless difficulties will give us merciless trials. Youth's struggle has a most arduous journey.</p>
<p>We must constantly reflect on whether our work has a definite plan and steps, pursuing the highest efficiency; whether we have become "事務主義者" (事務主義者 - roughly, "事務主義者" refers to someone who is overly focused on administrative details and routine tasks, neglecting broader goals and principles), rushing around all day but accomplishing nothing, completely neglecting learning, and not even reading the day's newspaper; whether we have become the new "华威先生" (华威先生 - a character who is known for attending meetings, drafting regulations, and having tea, but not for taking concrete action), spending all day in meetings, just drafting regulations and drinking tea.</p>
<p>We must constantly reflect on whether we have eliminated the petit-bourgeoisie's impetuousness, jealousy, and desire for leadership; whether we have been influenced by "张振华型" (Zhang Zhenhua type - refers to someone who is always boasting about their past achievements and flaunting their talents) characters, who open their mouths and talk about how they were in the past, dazzling with their talents; whether we have turned into "吴大雄型" (Wu Daxiong type - refers to someone who seeks a certain position, grabs the leadership of the group, and becomes resentful when they fail) fellows, seeking some position, seizing the leadership of the group, and then becoming resentful when they fail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what must be constantly reflected upon is whether we have committed left-wing childishness, whether we have drunk the poison of heroism, whether we have indulged in some romance, forgetting the mission of our work, forgetting the hardships of the era... These, these, are all things that our youth should take to encourage others and to encourage ourselves.</p>
<p>Youth is the driving force for China's rebirth. Youth must become a tenacious fighter!</p>
<h3>Kong Yunting and Rousseau</h3>
<p>— Qiong Fu</p>
<p>——Gleanings from Reading</p>
<p>Kong Yunting, in his preface to "The Peach Blossom Fan," describes the circulation of his play in this way:</p>
<p>When "The Peach Blossom Fan" was completed, all the princes, nobles, and gentry borrowed it for copying, causing a temporary scarcity of paper. On the evening of Yi Mao, an eunuch urgently needed "The Peach Blossom Fan," so I gave him a clean copy. Forgetting where it was transmitted, it was found by Minister Zhang Pingzhou, who offered a copy at midnight to the imperial residence, and it entered the imperial library.</p>
<p>In the fourth month of Si Chen, I had already resigned. Mr. Mu An invited me to watch "The Peach Blossom Fan." All the officials of the Hanlin Academy and the provinces gathered, allowing me to sit in the upper seat alone, ordering the actors to repeatedly offer me wine. They invited me to comment, and the guests pointed and looked, quite with an air of soaring to the clouds.</p>
<p>One can see that the author takes pride in this, but this is something one cannot think deeply about. "The Peach Blossom Fan" is "mainly to express the pain of the fall of the Ming Dynasty," but the author is pleased to have received the favor of the Qing emperor and the support of the Qing princes and nobles. It is really incomprehensible. Does it really confirm the claim of some of our "scholars" that the work and the author's personality are not at all related?</p>
<p>But so be it, let those "scholars" be happy. However, this reminds me of a French ancient whom we "scholars" have often scolded.</p>
<p>Rousseau, in the eighth volume of his "Confessions," describes the scene when his opera "Le devin viliage" was performed. It is somewhat similar to Kong Yunting's pride. He said that he, as the author, also sat in a box, and opposite him sat the emperor and empress, and all the figures of the court. He did not shave his beard, nor did he change his clothes. He sat there, quietly listening to the praises and comments of the noble ladies around him. He also described the scene after the performance, which was even more enviable than Kong Yunting's pride. He said that the next day, the emperor wanted to summon him and give him an annuity.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Rousseau was a sworn enemy of the emperor and the nobles. Even the play that was considered successful at the time, although now recognized as an unremarkable work, still expressed the emotions of the common people and expounded his views. But he described the emperor and nobles treating him well in such a way that it seemed he was proud of it. This is clearly like Kong Yunting, slapping himself in the face.</p>
<p>In this way, it seems that our "scholars" should not have scolded Rousseau. Didn't Rousseau also help to prove the claims of those people?</p>
<p>But don't rush to conclusions. Although Rousseau described sitting with the emperor and nobles, he was proud of the fact that he was unadorned, sitting with the emperor and nobles in the clothes of a commoner. Then he greatly elaborated on the reasons for not shaving his beard and not changing his clothes, meaning: I watch my play, to hell with them. Although he also described the emperor wanting to see him, he immediately said that he did not want to see the emperor, and he even used sarcastic language to say some reasons why he did not want to see the emperor. Rousseau was, after all, a bit of a "spoilsport," and in the end, he did not achieve the same pride as our Kong Yunting, so he only ended up with no satisfaction.</p>
<p>In the end, what China has, foreign countries may not necessarily have. Rousseau is just one who doesn't join in the fun. I now understand why our "scholars" want to scold him.</p>
<p>But don't rush. If you have read the great work by one of our "scholars" introducing "Confessions" in the past, when you read the two passages mentioned above, you cannot help but be shocked. Rousseau sitting with the emperor and nobles was introduced; but Rousseau's elaboration of his contempt for the attire of the upper class was completely "banished," without a trace. The emperor wanting to see Rousseau was also introduced; but Rousseau's satirical text saying that he did not want to see the emperor was translated into two sentences with a changed face. Originally, our "scholar" insisted on making Rousseau exactly the same as the literary writers in our history. This work can be considered successful, but it seems that those "scholars" who scolded Rousseau did not see this great work. What a pity, what a pity.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Celebrating Youth Day</h3>
<p>— Li Zhengyao, Xie Yude</p>
<p>As everyone knows, in the history of the national liberation movement, "May Fourth" is the most glorious and heroic page. It was the prelude to the Great Chinese Revolution of 1925-27, and the beginning of Chinese students participating in political activities and taking on the two major tasks of opposing × and opposing nation-building. This great movement is now twenty years old. In these twenty years, Chinese students have created many miracles in the struggle for the liberation of the people in an isolated environment, using their blood and flesh. In the future, they will complete their great historical mission of resisting the war and building the country with a more heroic posture.</p>
<p>As the War of Resistance enters its second phase, and with final victory approaching, it is of great significance for us to commemorate May Fourth. What excites us even more is that the central government has announced May Fourth as China's Youth Day. Undoubtedly, this shows that the Chinese student movement has gained the sympathy and assistance of the government of the motherland through its continuous efforts and struggles. In the future, the Chinese student movement will have a more glorious and promising future.</p>
<p>We, the students in Hong Kong, will overcome our past shortcomings and strengthen our future work to celebrate the great Youth Day! To safeguard the achievements of the heroic struggles of our advanced students over the past twenty years!</p>
<p>Before we point out the general direction of our future efforts, let us conduct a brief review of the Hong Kong student movement in the past:</p>
<p>Hong Kong students, like students in the mainland, have their own fine traditions. They are not afraid of hardships, nor are they afraid of boredom. In the desert-like Hong Kong, they have scattered the seeds of resisting × and saving the nation. They have worked hard and perseveringly to win the sympathy of society. They are also able to grasp the urgent requirements of the objective situation and carry out various tasks to provide material and human assistance to the motherland. Undeniably, there are also many shortcomings in the past Hong Kong student movement:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of a strong grassroots foundation (school organization). This is mainly due to the weakness of the Hong Kong student movement in the past. Because of this shortcoming, student movement work has not been able to penetrate into the vast student population within the school. In the future, we must intensify the development of school organizations and mobilize a wide range of students to participate in the work in order to support and expand the student movement in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(2) The working methods are too advanced. Different objects, different environments, should use different working methods. However, the working students in Hong Kong have not paid attention to this point. When they carry out their work, they always follow the working methods of the mainland, such as propaganda, organization, current affairs seminars, etc. In the eyes of the average student, they are all a boring series, and as a result, only a small part of the more advanced students are united, while other vast students are still far away from the camp of saving the nation.</p>
<p>(3) The work is not closely related to the students' lives. Many students feel that schoolwork is too heavy, many students feel that life is boring, and many students feel that many personal problems, such as studying, love, and economic problems, have no way to solve. However, when working, our students in Hong Kong did not grasp these urgent requirements, but instead put forward empty slogans such as what kind of responsibilities young people should have in the great era. Of course, the results will not attract the attention of students full of depression.</p>
<p>(4) The work did not win the sympathy and leadership of teachers. Although Hong Kong students have often put forward the slogan of "teachers and students working together to overcome national difficulties," in fact, when carrying out the work, they rarely humbly asked teachers for instructions and assistance. Teachers have more experience than us, and their vision is broader than ours. Our work needs the instructions and supervision of advanced teachers. If all our work is also carried out through the relationship of teachers, undoubtedly, many difficulties will be reduced in the work.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>First Mission</h3>
<p>— Ren Linrui</p>
<p>Early autumn, the weather is still very hot, the cotton nurtured and grown by the earth, the white flowers, have long been picked by the local farmers, as a reward for their hard work throughout the year, leaving only withered branches. Also, the graves scattered everywhere in this desolate field.</p>
<p>There are no mountains, but there are earth mounds, protruding in the fields, as if managing everything for the large field.</p>
<p>The small river is not wide, but there are several of them. It can lead you to the famous Tang Family Ancestral Hall, it can lead you to the bank, into the vast, dark, deep green bamboo forest. Now during the day, you can often see the garrisoned soldiers here. They will wave to you, driving a pointed little boat and rowing with a single oar very easily.</p>
<p>The Second Public Military Hospital is located in a public elementary school in the countryside. Inside, there is also a rescue team sent from the Shanghai Red Cross Society. The hospital is extremely quiet, and the quilts covered by the wounded soldiers are mostly sent by the common people themselves.</p>
<p>We often go to this hospital, because the Boy Scouts also have to do rescue work. When carrying the wounded soldiers, the road is very difficult to walk, all of it is on narrow paths between the fields, but we are not used to walking there, so we always walk along the bank of the small river. The small river is beautiful, and the small river is our compass.</p>
<p>There are only twenty or so rural houses near the public hospital in the fields, all of them old and dilapidated. This is the only housing here. Some of our comrades are going there.</p>
<p>It is already quite cool in the evening. The moon shines on the wilderness. Looking over, there is not a single light. Only the silver-grey of the moon shrouds the field.</p>
<p>I and Lao Gu - he is older than me, and taller than me; we went to stand guard together. He carried a rifle and a bamboo strip of bullets on his back.</p>
<p>Although I feel a little chilly, this kind of environment is what we are willing to accept. We patrol the fields.</p>
<p>There are two strong men in front. After answering our - the password of the day, they immediately rushed over and told us that someone seemed to be sending signals behind the grave mounds in front. A green flame first, quickly released into the sky.</p>
<p>I took the gun from Lao Gu's hand. Quickly, the four of us dispersed to surround this dangerous grave mound. I felt a little hesitant, a little scared, but catching people, ah, I stepped on the green grass and quickly circled around.</p>
<p>"No one," we ran two circles. When we encountered each other, we all made the same strange sound.</p>
<p>After sending the strong men away, we hid nearby with vigilance, pointing the muzzle at the newly-built grave.</p>
<p>The cool night is silent. There is only our breathing here.</p>
<h3>The Snow in Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Are you satisfied this time?"</p>
<p>She puffed out her cheeks, looked at him, and remained silent.</p>
<p>"Do you still want me to buy you a newspaper?"</p>
<p>"I won't let you buy it anymore!"</p>
<p>He finally achieved his goal.</p>
<p>From then on, she dragged on that childishness and stopped talking to him; just like the kind of reserve that everyone often has in their childhood. He came to see her several times, looking for an opportunity to talk; but she ignored him, and deliberately pretended to have an expression and action that violated her inner feelings. To show the other party her dissatisfaction and revenge. The other party was not a child, he understood those things: so not only was he not angry, but he was also happy - his perverted expression proved her psychological normality - indicating that she had forgotten herself outside of the temporary changing situation.</p>
<p>It was at this time that a common thing happened. Two drunken Japanese soldiers, staggering with crooked limbs, walked into this building with inaccurate steps due to the loss of balance in their feet. On the corridor upstairs, the two of them walked arm in arm, as if after a meal, they had walked onto an uninhabited wilderness and picked a quiet path. Digesting food, and humming an unclear lewd tune in their mouths. Sometimes, they casually kicked open the door, roared at the owner of the door, and then laughed and closed the door. Therefore, all the doors were closed by the owners of each house, enduring with infinite tolerance.</p>
<p>However, that kind of harassment, in the ears of the local, was still for the first time. She felt both novel and distrustful. At this time, she no longer maintained that elegance towards her only acquaintance, and finally spoke to him.</p>
<p>"Open the door and let me see!"</p>
<p>"I can't!"</p>
<p>"It's not like I'm asking you to buy me a newspaper again, bothering you again!"</p>
<p>She seemed to want to restore the elegance that had just dissipated, and threatened him. (Five Six)</p>
