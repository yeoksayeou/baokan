<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國制裁日本的具體化</h3>
<p>英日兩國在太平洋上，甚至於在世界上的對立，是絕對無法調和的。雖然幾年來，日本方面還有一部分人追逐着「英日同盟的舊夢，英國方面也如「孟哲斯德衛報」所言，「已往八九年中英國官吏向少明白陳述意見」，一任日本法西斯主義者鼓煽排英的風氣。現在，英國因為兩種原因，而其對日態度和决心，已經具體表現了：其一是粵漢戰後東亞情勢惡化的發展；其二是在太平洋政治舞台上舉足輕重的美國，堅决對日採取强硬態度和制裁辦法。</p>
<p>英國對日强硬態度及積極行動的决心，綜合地表現於這次對日的照會上。英國固然尊重外交禮節與外交詞令，但在這次的照會上，措詞却非常强硬而又具體。這個照會的內容包含三個要點：第一指出日本侵略者在中國實際播弄的種種陰謀；第二完全否認日本「以武力造成的變動」，及日本片面廢除九國公約；第三申論中國在日本侵略戰爭前，政治漸趨穩固，經濟也日就發展。這些論點都是揭穿侵略者的國際欺騙的有力論據。我們對於英國這種態度對於維護國際正義及條約的影響，抱着極大的感慰和期待。</p>
<p>英國這次的具體表示，固然是得到美國幾次對日强硬照會的影響，但是英國的照會發出後，必然還增加美國更堅强的决心，因為美國能否實施對日制裁的計劃、還要决定於英美兩國的太平洋政策能否「平行」，二者在國際舞台上能否切實合作。英國對日本採取强硬態度，還能够促進法國對日政策强硬，因為法國不但在東方的行動要視英美政策為斷，它在西方更需要英國為之撑腰，以制止德意侵略者的夾攻。英國這次照會的提出，据說，事前先將牒文提送美京及巴黎方面，經美法兩國政府同意始行發出，故其力量將更增大，因為美法在道義上負有與英國切實合作制日的義務，倘若日本「仍掩耳詐聾，美法兩國將决與英國合作對日取報復之制裁行動」，如「每日郵報」之推斷。</p>
<p>英國這次的通牒，與平常的照會不同，這正如倫敦外交界的推測，是對日的「最後警告」，如日本再不理會，則英美法將聯合一致，採取積極之經濟制裁行動。英國此次對日强硬的表示，更有一重要的力量，就是得到全國輿論界的支持與督促。「孟哲斯德衛報」嚴加評論，說：「吾人對英國致日本之照會，惟有一嚴重的批評，卽為其提出，為時太遲」，又謂：「此次之一鳴驚人，固甚足讚佩也」。英國人民，特別是與英國在華權益有密切關係的商人，及代表人民意志的議員，早即切實要求着英國政府對日本採强硬政策保護應有利益。英國政府執行人民的意志，雖然未免有過遲之疑，但是素採沈着而確實的外交步驟的英國政府，此後當必能貫澈這次通牒上所表示「最後警告」的决心。</p>
<p>然而英國將得不到日本滿意的答復和問題的解决辦法，是可以預斷的。日本政府雖然還沒有正式的答復，但是日本輿論却已大表憤激，其對英國的批評更趨荒謬，竟有如「報知新聞」所指摘，「英國必係失去知覺」。「日日新聞」更具體提出意見，謂：「英國如再擁蔣，日本將不得不視為主要仇人」。「報知新聞」在英國照會揭露日本陰謀之前，還强辯說：「駐軍事乃係出於偽組織之請求」，這種掩耳盜鈴的劣技，才眞正「失去知覺」。此後英日問題的演變，當如我們在平沼新內閣成立之前所預斷的：排英的罪魁的末次內相雖然離開了政府，而英日的關係並不能因此而得到調整。</p>
<p>依我們的意見，英國受到日本的排斥和責罵，為時已久，英日兩國的利害又是無法調和，英國不擁護自已在遠東的權益則已，否則現在已經是最適當而有力量的時候了。</p>
<p>不但美法表示誠意與英合作，卽如荷蘭也有加入的可能。這個集團的力量對日本的壓迫，將使日本無法自存。卽令德國的海軍專家、也都承認：「英美兩國在太平洋的軍力，遠比日本為優。至經濟方面，英美實操縱日本大部分之出口，而日本之出口又是日本之經濟命脉」。這正和我們以前時常討論過的結論完全相符。英國最低限度應該有勇氣率先施行「懲罰的高關稅」，取消日本在最惠國條欵所享受的權利，或更進一步完全禁止日本商品輸入本英國及殖民地。</p>
<h3>日本國內外形勢檢討</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>日本內閣最近改組了、發動蘆溝橋事變的禍首近衛是坍台了、在我抗戰進入第二期新階段、日本發生了這一塲政　、不啻是×人在廿八年度新年中給我們一個很好的禮物、也可以說、由於我們前綫浴血將士死力　來的一個大禮物、日內閣改組、分明暴露出侵略戰爭的失敗、因為一年〇六個月來的中國神聖抗戰、把×人逼到了最後關頭了、</p>
<p>平沼在五日登台那一天、他第一個的聲明、是自認日本是處在有史以來所未曾有的緊急關頭、要想克服當前的困難、却不易易、平沼想他以為取如他們日本國民能在他們天皇的領導下、團結一致、或許也是可能　、我　由平沼的這項聲明中、明白地知　、日本是日暮途窮了、他們能團結一致嗎？不可能的、假使能團結一致、近衛可以不必下台、就平沼也可以不必上台了、</p>
<p>近衛內閣、為何崩潰、為何總辭職？其近因是軍部要實施總動員計劃、而近衛一再表示不讚回極早實現、於是意見的不統一、近衛便被迫而下台、這在意義上是表現看日財開、資本家和法西斯軍閱的鬥爭、日本國家的機構、一切生產、都操縱在財閱資本家手里、法西斯派的軍關、却想奪取過來、讓他們支配、自九一八起、直到如今、那在明爭暗鬥着、</p>
<p>我們應該知道、近衛是西園寺一手提拔出來的貴公子、他便是財閥政黨、資本家的代言人、財閥政黨們對中國侵略的方針、和法西斯軍閥不同、財閥想不流血、而用經濟榨取方法侵略中國、軍閥不滿足這種和平的榨取、故發動了大規模的侵略戰爭、抗戰了一年有半的結果、把日本陷到了極嚴重的危機、財閥們想適可而止、年早的結果戰事、軍閥們也想速戰速决、然而他們的政治的陰謀和速戰速决的戰略都被我們擊破了、軍閥們便只好把戰爭愈加擴大、把侵略愈加增强、</p>
<p>日本財閥是完全失去控制法西斯軍閥的力量、我們又可以知道、日軍閥是一匹瘋狂的馬、而日本這輛馬軍一定要碰崖、所有的崖、便是中華民國四萬萬同胞的、所以平沼登台的聲明、就是迴光反照分裂的現象、平沼內閣、可想而知是短命內閣、不僅如此、卽日本帝國主義、××××××××××、</p>
<p>板垣向平沼所提議七項要求、不外是想一心一意要滅亡中國、因為由於去年十二月二日的一塲政治陰謀迷夢的失敗、法西斯軍閥更提出擴充軍備、加强日德意的軸心、全國動員的計劃、這分明又是日帝國主義者進一步的末路了、要擴充軍備、非經濟力量不能成功、抗戰以來、日本經濟狀况如何、前年七七事變以後、屢次增加軍費預算、已經是三十九萬萬五千萬、而去年是六十萬萬、據一般人估計、日本每日的軍費至少是五萬萬、由估算中、一年半來×人消耗巳達一百萬萬元左右了、而這麼大的軍費、日本所依靠的是發行多量公債、他們在七七事變以後、原來凖備發行三十五萬萬元、可是僅僅發行了十五萬萬、推銷的結果、只有四萬萬五千五百元、因為發行公債的失敗、龐大的軍費、無法補救、於是又增加租稅、發行紙幣、最近一元巳低下二毛、因此日本國內厭戰的現象極為普遍、而法西斯軍閥、依然不斷地欺騙民衆、榨取民衆、一般國民、只得天天祈禱着戰爭停止、</p>
<p>他們要想加强日德意軸心、這分明是擴大世界大戰、其實、意國自顧不暇、當然沒有力量援助日本、而德國也决不會出兵援日作戰的、所謂加强軸心不過是在歐洲上給其他各國的牽制而已、至於英美法民主國家、英國的重要生命綫都在東方、如今×人予他們一個限制、英國無論如何不會和日本合作、事實上，英國又有新借欵給我，這更給予×人一個困難加緊。講到美國，羅斯福總統，他是主張修正中立法，意思是限制軍火運輸侵略國，日本軍力的優越，都是仰仗於外國，羅斯福要改正中立法，原因也是在要限制日本，制裁日本，美國對中國素來是友好的，國務卿赫爾已經警告美商人，日本要買軍火，非現金不可，所以日本在美國人的心中早已沒有信用了。至於法國，他是很據英美熊度，進行他的外交政策的。</p>

<h3>參加新四軍工作的日本俘虜</h3>
<p>— 報本特約記者嚴速寄自皖南</p>
<p>不知游擊隊有多少，交戰不到十分鐘，我因受傷而暈倒在地上，後來被歸隊的號聲吹醒了。（事後才知這是新四軍的號聲）未幾，就被中國的老百姓抓住交給新四軍。（問）你被俘時的內心感覺怎樣，（答）我被捕時，眼睛受些傷，我以為必無生望。因長官告訴我們，中國軍人要殺日本俘虜的，但是到了此地三天，和一位　得日語的新四軍同志談話以後，才明白實際情形不是如此，我到此巳有三個月，一切蒙新四軍優待，除了物質生活很舒適外，還給我們念書（念中國書和日本文的前進小說）工作（敎士兵日文日話口號和做日括的宣傳品）和自由出入（指自由到街上去玩的意思—記者）的權利。因此，我的精神生活也很愉快。（問）假使新四軍方面此刻就把你釋放囘國，你願不願意，如果願意的話，那麼打算回國做些什麼？（答）我是願意囘國的，回國去結合朋友們做傾向社會主義與反戰方面思想的宣傳，但是，這恐怕个可能了。因為如果日本軍部知我囘國一定會把我殺死的。（間）現在日本國內情形怎樣？人民對於政府的關係怎麼樣？（答）一般的講，日本國內人民近來因物價飛漲，生活日益貧苦，對政府很沒有好感，已在逐漸開始反對（以工人勞苦羣衆居多數），　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。（問）你看見，在華的日兵中生什麼病的最多？（答）生霍亂，凍瘡，瘧疾，的最多，夏天霍亂，冬天凍瘡，瘧疾是常年有的。（問）你以為中日戰爭的前途，結果怎樣？（答）中日戰爭將是一個持久戰爭，那是一定的，據我的估計，大約要九年時間，戰爭結果，中國能夠得到最後勝利，也是一定的，因為戰爭一延長，日本在人力物力方面的困難，就要增加，同時人民方面（包括共產黨）反戰的力量。也必然會凝結起來打倒日本閥軍，那時候，日本中樞，因平時與日本人民根本沒有關係，也必然會倒下去的。（問）中日戰事結束以後，你預備做什麼事情？（答）中日戰爭結束後，我想囘到日本去，聯合朋友們討論並宣傳我在這裏所得的印像與學習到的東西，（問）在這裏三個月的生活怎樣？（答）最初這裏的食物，我有些吃不慣，而且有的東西我不敢吃，因為怕有什麼問題，現在不但習慣了，而且我很相信，很滿意，因此我很希望帮助中國打倒日本軍閥，當作酬謝。（問）你離開日本時有沒有人歡送？（答）有的，是由軍部發動人民來送的。（問）你現在想个想家？（答）起初很想，現在好一些，因為新四軍已帮助我與家裏通信。（問）你有沒有愛人？（答）有一個，還在東京念書。（問）她現在怎樣，你想念　聲？（答）現在不知道，在送別我的時候，她曾對我哭過，當然我是很想念她的，我現正請新四軍當局設法與　通信。如果能够設法把她帶到中國來，那是我所量盼望的。</p>
<p>各國記者的中日戰爭觀　（續十二日第二版）</p>
<p>實在杞憂以上、世界列强的不滿與焦慮正繼續不停、日本也不能例外、</p>
<p>小森、亞拉茲先生有何見敎、</p>
<p>瑞士人中國日報經濟部長亞拉茲氏、東洋和平復興最根本第一條件是　戰、當一方面繼續着大規模的戰爭行為時、任何一國都無從自由地提出和平，克服和平的喻提條件、不問其正式與否、就是停戰協定、</p>
<p>任何戰爭沒有永遠繼續的、也不能永遠繼續、歷史上的一切戰爭都以媾和條約的締結作結束、遠東的情形、極為顯然、日本在大陸雖有莫大權益、應加擁護、　大陸國自攻所有的更大權益更　防衛、所以為了遠東的永久和平、和平條件必須顧慮到兩國的權益和觀點、决不能是一方面對於他方面的强制、大國國民當然不能認受一方面的屈辱條件、徵之最近的德國、自可明瞭、如果槍尖可以支持和平、那就太奧妙了、</p>
<p>小森、那麼、就此結束、多謝諸君、</p>

<h3>西北形勢與河防</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者白雲</p>
<p>一、×人進攻西北的時機還未成熟</p>
<p>自廣州失　　　　　　以後，中日戰事，顯然已進入一個新　　　　國　之觀察戰局者，早已認為×必繼此以進攻西北，而以西安與關州為目標，因而提出保衛西北的任務。×人方面，亦曾於佔領武漢以後，宣傳其所謂第四期作戰，將進攻　州。故當時全國都極重視西北局勢之演進，而表示關切。適其時報載晉南之×，時有增加，風陵渡之×不時炮擊潼關，隴海線發生部份障碍，×機復不斷空　西安寧夏與陝北若干地方，似確有西犯之勢；同時又有種種情報與傳說，淆亂聽聞，如『×方已準備以十師團，由梅津率領，進攻西安，又以八師團附若干聯隊，由蓮沼率領，進攻寧夏以趨蘭州』。綏遠方面，×人西進的消息，亦不斷傳來：如「×擬由漢口調遣兩師團至綏，　在歸綏號定民房　用。」如『×攻我西儿的計劃，已逐漸積極化，據報其第一路軍，分下列三路前進：一由熱河經通州轉平綏線西進；二由熱河園塲經多倫至張家口；三集合晋北及察境之混合軍到大同，傳不日卽將有所動作。』如『×犯西北第二路司令官運沼，傳已在張家口，調兵遺將，北支軍最高指揮官寺內。傳卽赴大同包頭指揮一切。』又如『×西犯企圖，益見積極，百靈廟×偽，連日開固陽者，已達六千餘，歸綏×巳增加三千餘，包頭偽軍二師，由漢奸李某任司令，為西進先頭部隊，久野等部八百餘，附汽車六十餘輛，已向西移動，包頭機場停×機廿餘架，每日有駱駝三百餘及汽車若十向西輸送』這些消息，頗使認識不淸的人們發生焦慮，當時佔領漢口以後之×，正　襄樊為目標，分兵向西北前進，因之又有人認為×將先佔襄樊，沿漢水進攻漢中，同時由綏包佔五臨，沿黃河進攻寧夏，以達蘭州，對西安取大包圍形勢。似乎整個西北巳置於×人控制之下，而岌岌可危，人心因之益趨浮動。此時，記者正在西安，乃走訪關係各方、探詢　相、已證明這些是缺乏判斷的消息和昧於大勢的觀察。記者為明瞭河防現况，以使對西北局勢作綜合的判斷與觀察，旋赴朝邑平民與潼關一帶視察，最近始返西安。此行結果，益證明上述部些消息和情報，大都是×人的空氣作用，而河防鞏固，×人若無　份凖備，决不敢輕言西犯。去年十二月三十日河曲電報稱『綜台近旬情况，晉北及綏遠之×，仍無增加模樣，現駐晋綏×軍計有第一一〇，一〇八，一〇九與一一六等四師團，大同及綏包各有×約千餘，固陽武川等地各有×三五百人』。這已否定了上述×已開始或即將進攻寧蘭那些消息的正確性。進攻襄樊之×巳受我當頭一棒而潰退，可知×人計劃進政漢中的觀察過於誇張。統觀全局，可說×人進攻西北的時機，還未十分成熟。我政府對於西北國防，已有愼密規劃，决不能使西北輕於發生動搖。西北的抗戰形勢，尙大有呵為。西北將來正可為收復華北失地的起點，目前在這個暫時沉寂的局面之下，正是我們積極作　×準備的時候。一切悲觀和失敗的情緒，必須掃徐凈盡。</p>
<p>近來國際局勢，一再發生有利於我們的變化，我們抗戰到底的政策與力量，日益堅强。因此，更增加了×人的新困難，而泥脚將愈陷愈深。記者根據這種新局勢，與所採各方面的意見，對西北抗戰形勢的現况及未來，作一種綜合的叙述。</p>
<p>二、×人何以不立刻進攻西北</p>
<p>進攻西北，確實是×人對我作戰計劃中的要點之一。這與進攻武漢，進攻廣州，在×人認為是同樣重要的。然而在武漢放棄與廣州失守以後，一般人認為×人巳在開始進攻西北的軍事行動，×人也一再這樣作宣傳，為甚麼却沒有實現？全部戰局，反陷於暫時的沉寂狀態？這有以下發種原因：</p>
<p>第一，×人原幻想於佔領武漢與廣州以後，『乘勝追擊』，一舉而消滅我主力軍，打通粵漢綫，再轉兵北向，進攻西北。那知他們經過徐州與武漢約十閱月兩次的會戰，損失車大，早已陷於精疲九竭之狀。故湘北受我打擊，廣州也未能站穩，同時我在廣東增加生力軍，調整陣容，武漢旣是有計劃的放棄了，所以對於湘鄂間的佈置，也及時完成，打破了×人的幻想。按照內戰時代的經驗，岳州失陷以後，長沙卽不易守；可是這次我們離然於岳州失守以後，還能阻×南犯，以辛於今。可見我們的軍事部署，較之上海南京徐州失守以接的情形，已大大的進步了，實出×人意料之外。說者謂：假使我們放棄武漢還早幾天，則湘鄂間的佈置，可提前完成，×人未必能攻下岳州，這話並不誇張。×人至此，始知難而退，在粵北湘北均採取守勢，主戰塲的戰事已遂暫趨沉寂。</p>
<p>第二、×人打通粵漢線的計劃，旣已失敗，急需休息，接着進行進攻西北的艱鉅工作，更不可能。那時×人進攻襄樊，主要的為保障武漢的安全。即使他們佔了襄樊，也無力繼續前進，進攻漢中：何况襄樊旣未卜，對西北進行大包國之說，更不可能了。長江以北和平漢線南段的×人，此時當然不能不改取守勢。</p>
<p>第三、×人那時已經過了十五憫月的侵　戰爭，得不價失，大吃苦頭，而我們抗戰到底的政策，却並不因廣州與武漢兩個重鎭的淪陷，而有所改變，反愈形堅决。全面的游擊戰，發展於×人的後方，日益擴大，×人所望於我們的『求降言和』既不可能，速戰速决的迷夢，更受打擊，所以×人不能不暫時停止進攻，對侵略我們的政業，不能不重有所檢討：先肅淸佔領區域，健全偽組織，並緩和其國內危機，再徐圖進攻以滅中國呢？還是先加强其國內的軍閥統治，繼續進攻中國，以至於　我，再徐圖消化呢？假使開始新進攻，將仕何處看手呢？在這些問題沒有决定以前，自須暫時停止進攻。</p>
<p>第四，×人對於我們抗戰到底的政策，絕不能改變，然而他們還想在我們的營壘中，找點破綻，以進行其所謂『和平』的政治陰謀。為了進行這一陰謀的便利，自然有暫時停止進攻的必要。</p>
<p>第五，正當此時，忽然發生了國際形勢有利於我們的轉變，英美援助我們，貸以鉅欵，中美白銀協定之延長，蘇日因漁業協定而發生裂痕，由外交上影響於×人的內政與軍事，關係殊大。×人還要由華北調　出關，向你聯示威，那有力量繼續進攻西北？</p>
<p>全部戰局旣因上述種種原因，而暫時的陷於沉寂，則繼續進攻西北的姿熊，除裝腔作勢的解釋以外，還有甚麼意義呢？</p>
<p>三、西北的危機是否消滅</p>
<p>×人的國策旣以滅亡我國為其决定的基礎，則繼佔領武漢與廣州而進攻西北的觀察，自具眞實性。除非×國內發生革命，經濟與財政發生崩潰，國際加以制裁，或我們已有了反攻的力量，他們的國策不能改變，×人進攻西北均危機也決不能因戰局的暫時沉寂而消滅。這種危機，遲早終有實現的可能，當然這種危機在將來也有消减的可能，然而這種消滅的條件，要我們由保　西北的艱苦奮鬥中去爭取。這種條件，在目前並未具備，所以西北的危機，還是存在的。進攻西北，在×人未來的戰略中，恐怕還佔着極重要的地位。</p>
<p>全部戰局的沉寂，對我們也有利益，就是我們可以乘機作更充份的準備，縮短獲得最後勝利的時　。目前這種沉寂的時間，究竟要延長到甚麼時候呢？這要有×我國際和國內環境之變化如何來决定，現在不能具體的指出，譬如英美合作若能日益具體化，蘇聯對日的漁業問題交涉若能强硬到底，則加於×人的壓力，一定極大。這種沉寂的時間或者要稍延長，不過我們也並不畏懼×人提早進攻，因為今後×人的進攻，蔣要失去鐵路線和平原地的便利，而深入我內地，利於我之處多於×人，所以西北危機之消滅與否，並不完全决定於×人來攻之遲與早，要視我們保衛西北的努力如何耳。　（未完）</p>
<h3>國防新前線…沙市動態</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵增</p>
<p>一、武漢撤退後之荊沙</p>
<p>荊沙地居長江中游，為那西巨埠，且為武漢後屏，形勢之重要，不問可知。商業文化等方面，也相當繁盛。惟自武漢廣州等地相繼自動撤退之後，荊沙的形勢，便突然的緊張起來，那時候記者正由南漳奉調來荊工作，抵沙後耳聞目觸，盡是　兵荒馬亂的情形，滿街上所有的，不是衣甲不全的從前方退下來的潰兵，使是哀號乞討的難民。沿街擺設的拍賣攤場，更是五花八門，不計具數．牆壁上塗滿了找人的小廣告，什麼「××已去××」，「××來可往××」……。諸如此類，　人看見便會想到了妻離子散，四散逃生的凄慘情况！</p>
<p>這時候，荊沙是在動盪中，假若×人得武漢後繼續逞兇西進的話，那末無疑問的，荊沙是可以垂手而得的。看吧！比較殷實的店舖，不是貼了「本店已遷宜營業」，便是「暫停營業」，統統的都閉門大吉了。留在這裏的，却又高抬物價，屯積居奇，有錢的人，當然是早就走了，窮的逃不走的却就苦了，滿街滿巷都在驚慌與變亂的狀態中。又那裏談得上什麼「鞏衛固守」呢？在這樣的情形，如果會延長下半個月的話，那未荊沙一定會變成「無人之墟」的！</p>
<p>武漢過來後，從長沙，衡陽，荊沙，以至襄樊，這一綫使成了一條國防綫，在這條綫上，荊沙又為具中心樞紐。可是長沙大火，襄樊狂炸，而居荊沙後方的宜昌，也終日在空襲聲中。這一切都足以增加荊沙的慌亂程度。這種「岌岌不可終日」的情形，直到劉超亮先生（　委會別動總隊長）兼荊沙警備司令職後方，一步步恢復了過來。</p>
<p>二、靑年團的活躍</p>
<p>劉超亮先生就職後即積極從事整頓工作，一面疏散人口做必要時之準備，一面又要安定人心，這是兩種矛盾的舉動。然而精明的劉司令，是把這兩種矛盾調和了，使整個的沙市從危難進到了安定，從安定又轉到常態，進而發展繁榮。</p>
<p>建設新沙市的第一步便舉行「淸潔運動」，動員了沙市所有的力量肅淸牆壁，取締沿街攤販，驅除野狗猪，統制標語招貼。一禮拜後整个的沙市，使煥然一新了。再加上妥置　兵難民，市面秩序亦全部恢復了，只有看到新生了的沙市，又那裏再找刀兵之象呢。</p>
<p>自肅淸市容後。組訓工作卽形展開，碼頭工人，打包工人，人力車夫，戲劇界同人都在靑年戰地服務團的領導下活躍起來了。</p>
<p>荊沙各界後援會青年戰地服務團，是在危難期中緊急組合，共集有高中以上，男女靑年四十餘人，別動總隊戰地服務隊的廿幾位同志，也參加裏面任義務幹部工作。由警備部指導處長劉礱潮兼任團長，他們的組織在生活管理方面依年齡性別等區分為三分隊，在工作方面則分為編輯，歌詠，漫畫，話劇，慰勞，救護，除好，民運等十組，他們在宣傳方面除了分演話劇，張貼標語漫畫，更行『因時地別宜』之口頭宣傳，如遇空襲警報解除時，則講　防空；遇槍斃漢奸時，即講述淸除漢好，觸目驚心，易收偉效。自沙市由危雞　逐漸轉入安定後，靑年團乃展開實際組訓工作，現在分別述之：</p>
<p>碼頭工會：　全沙市卅二碼頭設一碼頭總工會，復以地區所在分設四分會，每處派員一人協助辦理工友事務，現下共約工友五千餘人，以靑年團處處以工友利益為前提，故極得工人信仰。碼頭工人在沙市已團結成一鋼鐵似的　體矣！</p>
<p>打包工會：　打包廠工人數千，前雖有組織，實際上有名無實，自靑年團派員整理後，乃復達蓬勃復生，現下並每日行工人訓練，女工亦由女團員前往訓練，工作極為順利，工友對訓練誠　接受，團員等亦不避繁複，詳為講述，慈母般的愛施于工友，又怎能　得良好成續呢！</p>
<p>戲劇協會：　現下沙市共有戲院七家，自戲劇協會正式成立後乃堅守崗位努力工作，所有淫靡不堪，腐化社會之劇本，現已絕對停演，并定每星期　勞軍公演，以全部收入交後援會做勞軍之用。此次沙市獻金並行獻金公演多次，熱心救國輸捐，這種精神是沙巾戲劇界特有的現象。</p>
<p>商業同業公會：　人的給濟力量最充足，但他們最沒有組織，最缺乏訓練，所以他們的力量，一向是不容易發揮出來，現在沙市的各商店，已經分別組織同業公會，計四十餘種，今後他們將發出最大的力量，為新沙市謀幸福求改進，為抗戰增加新動力</p>
<p>人力車頭工會：沙沙市的人力車夫現在也組織起來了，他們也有總工會和幾個分會　他們將本着「有力出力」的原則，盡自已的　力來維繫交通，間接帮助抗戰，要知道勞動羣衆的力量，是最偉大最神聖的力量呵！</p>
<p>（三）獻金運動在沙市</p>
<p>獻金運動自廿七年十二月廿五日（復興節）起，至今年元旦日正式献金，在献金的三天過程中，靑年戰地服務團盡了最大的努力。他們除了努力運用所有工會，同業公會的力量外，更舉行街頭勸募，不怕路人的白眼，不怕吝嗇者的厭惡，他們是在熱烈的工作着，從這工作表現了他們的精神毅力，同時代表了革命靑年的本色</p>
<p>商會門前的献金台，三天來　時無刻不在擁擠　鬧中，雖然警報頻傳，但阻　住沙市同胞們熱情的奔放。有的是變目矢明的瞎丐，有的是沿街乞討的乙兒；有操賣笑生涯的神女，有童華古剎的比丘，前綫上退下的戰士，醫院裏休養的傷兵，沒有貧富沒有地位，他們都在一國信念下把自已的金錢　了出來！碼頭工人，打包工人，洋車夫等，要是可欽可佩，旣出力又出錢，這當不是一般視財如命的大腹買所可比擬的！</p>
<p>現在獻金已是結束了。十一萬元的獻金開了沙市的空前紀錄；這正表示了沙市同胞的熱烈慷慨。沙市的十五萬市民將是抗戰陣營裏的一隻有力的援車，在記者執筆的時候，恰得到宜昌三日獻金共一萬七千除元的消息。也忍不任說聲：「如此宜昌」了！</p>
<p>（四）尾聲</p>
<p>蓬勃的生氣，　漫了整個的沙市，現在已日趨繁榮，假若有人定過這地方的時候，一定會驚訝地說：「想不到會這樣安定」，是的，這樣近前方的沙市，的確有出人意外的安定和緊張。在生活上他沒有絲毫戰時狀態，然而在工作上却　處是生力，處處在緊張的激進。</p>
<p>看：沙布是在一日千里的活躍著</p>
<p>（圖係獻金十三元之女工）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>孩子們的福音</h3>
<p>中國孩子們的命運，早被擠落在全世界最不幸的泥沼裏，普遍的貧困，使驚人多數的孩子們沒有好好的受到敎養，而少數所謂『幸運兒』所受的『敎養之福』，在家庭的不用說了，在學校也多在坐『孩子牢獄』，因此『救救孩子們』的呼聲，久已成為每一個關心於我們『下一代』的敎養問題的人士所注意。</p>
<p>全面抗戰的砲聲打破了全國政治進步的障碍，『下一代』的敎養問題被提到抗戰建國事業的前端，而『打破孩子牢獄』也成為拯救孩子的重大任務。現據本報重慶十七日專電，敎部已通令全國各地小學，嚴禁體罰，這也許就是打破孩子牢獄，改善學校敎育的第一步，也可算是孩子們在抗戰中獲得解放的第一聲，我們不僅希望全國小學校師遵照這一通令，化孩子牢獄為孩子樂園，，但更希望社會先進份子協叻政府，注意到廣大多數被摒於學校門外的和流離顚沛於×人彈火下　的孩子們！</p>
<h3>華北戰局益轉嚴重</h3>
<p>日×五路進攻山西的計劃在今年新年被我擊破以後，現在又在積極凖備更大規模的進犯西北的軍事，大批×軍正向山西河南集中。我們為紛碎×人新的進攻，一方面已經完成四北全部軍事佈置，另一方面則在某路軍領導下，發動大規模的進攻熱河的戰鬥，馬蘭谷已有激戰，東北義軍亦在積極活動，華北戰局將益趨嚴重，當可斷言</p>
<p>華北戰局的嚴重，必然牽制了廣大的×軍，至少現在華北的十五個師團和東北三十多萬的×軍，將不能有調遣其他戰區的可能，對於華中華南抗戰，將是如何重大的帮助，不難想到。這裏應該特別指出，華中華南我軍現在已到加緊買行反攻的時候，即使為了阻止×軍新的進攻，也不應放過『先機制×』的機會。為了爭取勝利，每一個同胞應該更熱烈地擁護與援助這一反攻攻。</p>
<h3>美遠東外交政策檢討　子濃譯自去年美亞月刊十二月號</h3>
<p>美國哥倫比亞大學的敎授，遠東問題的權威學者皮佛爾的「遠東戰爭一週年」和美亞月刊的主編乍非的「美國對華放欵計劃的檢討」兩篇文章，都登載於「美亞月刊」，皮佛爾先生提出三點來討論：（一）美國在遠東的權益，已經破壞無餘；（二）美國的眞正意志，已為日本的戰爭×行所褻凟；（三）日本顯而易見的弱了許多。皮佛爾先生指出，因這三點美國需要重新估價其遠東外交政策的，是以他提出四個具體的方案，簡而言之如下：（一）救濟中國無辜的平民；（二）個人自動的抵制日貨；（三）停止賣軍用品給日本；（四）努力於非正式的，以信用（欵項）實際援華。皮佛爾先生以其銳利的眼光，擬定這幾個方案，是以不掀起現在美國的心理恐懼病。他的献議，除了一致贊成之外，就無話可說。如果美國人士要實施這個最低的救濟步驟　也需要心理的轉變的。現在，美國是充滿瘋狂而痳痺的和平主義，足以危害外交的行動和影響外交的思想的。</p>
<p>一個和平政策的基本條件，是基於法律的原理及其實施，和對方曉曉置辯的言辭。對於這兩個條件，最近美國的人士，還未澈底明瞭。須知法律的原理及其實施就是一個國家的國際關係上行為的指津，可是，如果一個國家祗為其自已而採行這些法則，及應用這些法則為維持其國外權益的道義律例，則整個基於這些法則的和平，制度就損害一部份了。如果一個國家蔑視國際行動的法則，不管國際命脉的權利和義務；其他的國家又以這些法則的不能實施，而不理這種混亂的國際政局，世界的和平休想能够維持的。</p>
<p>這兩個基本條件不獨為美國所蔑視，而且同時大部份人士甚至否認其存在的。這種情形之所以演變至此者，由於近年來外交關係變為一件普通的事情所致。不願和侵略者戰爭是一事；不能根據合理或肯定的證據以行動是另一事。一切人類的經驗，證明為其自已的利益而防護是最區要，是以令到人與環境平衡，而這一個金科玉律遂存在不滅了。而現在，美國的與情，表面上好像政府恐怕引起戰爭，是以對於任何國際上的歹人，緘口不言。「胆小如鼠」一句話，就是這種事實的最好寫照。不過，我不相信美國人士阻小如鼠的，祗是彷徨無計吧了。</p>
<p>彷徨無計最甚者，就是缺乏處置國際事情的行動。我以為對一個國家說及破壞或蔑視你的利益不是宣戰的。要求一個政府制止他國損害其國家和人民的利益，也不是一個遠法的行動。解决國際紛爭的方法是這麼多，所謂積極對日政策會引起戰爭，也不過是鏡花水月般的幻想吧了。</p>
<p>關於這，我們不能不注意我們的遠東外交政策。在「中國事件」發生之初，日本外交部的發言人，便謂日本的國祭公法的觀念，就是從國家行動演譯而成的可行的法則，是以日本要求自行處理，別國無容多嘴，軍事的行動愈來愈兇了。戰爭結束後，如果沒有社會和經濟革命，日本的地位就是建在東京製造出來的國際公法之上。</p>
<p>所以，我們要注意其他各國在遠東推進和實施的國際公法。最有趣的就是日本的征服觀念。在滿洲。有一個愧儡國家。表面上有一個獨立的政府。其實完全受日本的統治，這個計劃就是企圖逃避國際公法的非難。表明非有意侵略他國，不過，守法的世界，由國際聯盟和美國創造一個不承認原則。以資答覆。因此，世界各國中，祇有德，意，波蘭和沙維多四國與偽「滿」維持國交。偽「滿」因此斷絕一切國際關係，它的貨幣，出了國境之外，就形同廢紙；在世界上，它毫無經濟的地位，日本於是增加了許多困難。在世界上，日本的政治關係，也困難未已。各國的金融市場，日本不得問津。日本的商約關係也凍結起來，因為不與「滿洲國」訂一特別條約，日本不肯談判的。因此，各國都不直日本的所為，而不贊同它了。</p>
<p>在中國本郎，日本沒有新的政治技術擺佈出來。日本祗是設立許多傀儡政權，利用這些偽組織的名字去開發中國的富源。很淸楚的，「滿洲國」的一切設施，或者就是日本保護中國本部的利益的第一個步驟，這些利益，與各國鄱息息相關的。</p>
<p>日本第二個苦悶的問題，就是「戰爭」問題。它要避免美國總統實行中立法，要使其他各國不斥責，是以它說此次出兵中國並不是心存征服，祗是要强迫中國合作而已。所以這次糾紛，並非正式的戰爭，其實，這樣適弄巧反拙罷了，旣非戰爭，日本不能享有交戰國的權利。故不能執行國際公法上的戰爭法規。（未完）</p>

<h3>各難民營秩序良好　難民從事農作工藝　難童教育亦已按步實施　港府準備救濟露宿貧民</h3>
<p>本港政府為收容貧苦難民起見、經在錦田、粉嶺馬頭涌、京士柏及北角等地、建設難民營、各營所收容之離民、統計約達萬人、而各難民營之管理甚為嚴密完善、營中難民除衣食無缺外、目開始學習小工藝或從事田作、在若干時間後、難民當可達到自給地步、政府之設立難民營、除安頓貧苦難民外、并擬籟以解决本港露宿問題、緊急難民救濟會秘書賴恩神甫昨晨接見記者、對本港各區難民營之現况及管理情形、作詳細之報告、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>錦田難民從事農作</p>
<p>錦田難民從事農作錦田難民營原可容納五千人、但一部份經已離營返籍、目前該營、只有難民三千三百人、兩星期前、該營經已舉辦農藝、由難民担任農作、每五十人為一班、每班工作一星期、每日工作六小時、輪班服役、週而復始、難民耕種地共九英畝、田地及種子等皆由新界紳書鄧伯裘等借出者、錦田難民除從田作外、并習小工藝、如製造玻璃瓶草包等、目前每日可出產草包一千個、將來當可增加、又將舉辦木器製造塲、俾難民多習一藝、將來出品售價、將分與工作之雖民預料將來難民營工業發展後、難民當可達到自給地步、</p>
<p>粉嶺設立難童學校</p>
<p>粉嶺方面共有難民營三所、一在粉嶺之北、一在粉嶺之南、其餘一所則設在叉抗、三營共收容難民一千五百人、因當地環境關係、尙未舉辦工藝、亦未覓得田地以備難民耕作、粉嶺難民營中、共有難童二百名、難民營管理當局、為免使難童習於嬉怠起見、經已舉辦難童學校兩所、俾難童得以讀書識字、將來長成、不致淪為文盲、兩校成績頗為良好、將來有擴充之可能、同時、難民自行生產問題、亦在考慮中、一俟覓得善法、當可着手施行、</p>
<p>市內各營秩序良好</p>
<p>本港市內之各難民營收容人數約達四千京士柏營收容一千六百零七人、北角、一千四百七十一人、馬頭涌營原可收容一千零八人、但因撥出一部以收退入英境之華軍、目前僅收容難民八白一十七人、北角難民營設有難童學校共設四班、學生二百人、將來尙可擴充學額至五百名、北角難民所習之工藝為車衣及編製籘器等、婦女並祖任烹飪工作、京士柏營之難民亦從事小工藝、該營有婦女六十人從事車縫紉等、馬頭涌營擬舉辦肥皂製造塲、大約短期內便呵實現、各營難民工作頗為努力、將來當可有巨量之生產、出品售價皆由難民自行拿受、故難民當樂於工作、希望可獲自給、各營秩序甚為良好、</p>
<p>政府注意救濟貧民</p>
<p>賴氏繼云、本港政府之建設難民營、其主要目的固在收容戰區來港之難民、但目前各營尙未告滿額、而現在又無難民來港、預料將來亦不致再有多量難民來港、玫府當局擬利用難民營以收容本港露宿街頭之貧民、頃已開始調查露宿街頭之人數、準備將露宿者移送難民營、政府此種計劃、實屬一舉兩得、一方面使露宿街頭貧民得所歸宿、而一方面則可整頓市容、法至善也、且難民營內辦有工業、貧民入營後固可習藝、將來或到達能自給地步、實勝於飄泊頭街、政府此項計劃、將可於短期內實現云、</p>

<h3>訪問盧廣綿先生生席談　中國新工業在發展中</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>願有眼光的資本家踴躍投資</p>
<p>中國工業合作協會西北區辦事處主任盧廣綿先生昨天在婦女慰勞會歡迎會中，對於戰時的後方工業情形有所報告，經誌昨報。記者昨天特再往訪盧先生，又有很多寶貴的材料，亟應為關心國事的僑胞報道如下：</p>
<p>盧先生是在民國廿一年從英國回國的，自民國廿二年起，就在華北與南開大學，中華平民敎育促進社，燕京大學、淸華大學，齊魯大學及金城銀行等等團體，合組華北農產改進社，從事改進華北農業的工作。因為工作進行順利，事業發展迅速，這個華北農產改進社，又與經濟委員會，河北省政府，華北合作委員會等機關組成半官式的華北棉產改進會，對於改良種于，農村合作，敎育民衆，運銷棉花至美國……都表現突飛猛進的成續，在華北各省奠下了新農業的基礎。近來這幾個年中，盧先生都在苦幹着這樣的新興事業。與華北這樣發生了關係。</p>
<p>七七抗戰發生的時候，該會有一百多萬貸欵在農民不得收囘，隨着淪陷區域的擴大，工作進行，亦當然受着影響。</p>
<p>事變時，盧先生還在北平，輾轉至平漢路一帶與一般同志，展開艱辛的組織工作與生產工作，直至去年秋間，中國工業合作協會成立，盧先生就任了組織組組長兼西北區辦事處主任。前往西北發展戰時工業。</p>
<p>該社目前所能够生產的，除各種日用品之外，軍用工業如酒精，炸彈等等，都漸漸在增加生產中，據盧先生實地的經驗，認為難民大量移住內地之後，當務之急，就是發展生產事業，一方面可以供應日用品，奠定新工業的基礎；一方面使難民參加生產工作而不至於游散。而最大的作用還能够因為人民有組織，生產力增加，在地方未淪陷之前，可以帮助各地游擊戰之發展，萬一地方倫陷，這　有組織的生產份子，就是游擊隊的基本份子．這實在是在抗戰建國中的一個値得重視的問題。</p>
<p>關於戰時工業發展的有利條件，第一是難民多，人力容易動員起來；第二內地原料豐富，工業易於發展，第三是戰事發生，交通梗阻舶來品缺乏，是振興新工業的絕好機會，這盧先生在前天歡迎會中已略有說過，可是，關於目前發展工業困難之處，當時還未提及這一個問題，特別要請國人加以關壞。</p>
<p>據盧先生語記者，目前發展新工業所感到困難的：第一是資本不够。行政院雖撥有基金五百萬元，經常費每年五十萬元，可是要大量在各地開設各種工廠，資本還是據其不够，政府此時百事待興，關于發展工業的力量實在亦是止於如此，所以，只有希望中外人士踴躍投資。現在已經有很多具有深遠眼光的外國人士熱心襄助，還盼國內外金融界，資本家，為國家，為事業，而熱烈投資，以利新工業之發展。無論從抗戰從建國的觀點　來，這是極有意義要圖。與盧先生同來之西籍普義華德女士，亦就是負着這個籲請中外人士踴躍投資的任務。相信有眼光的金融界與資本家是不會錯過這個機會的。中國抗戰一定是勝利的，中國工業發展之時，亦就是個人投資成功之日。</p>
<p>第二是人才的缺乏，很多受過敎育的知識份子，多數喜愛做官而輕視工業，這亦是工業不能發展的一個原因。到了今天，亟應從敎育上改變的一般人的觀念，泯除錯悮的思想，以民族利益為前提，使中國及早成為一個健全的現代國家。</p>
<p>第三是技術的落後，專門人才缺乏。如目前缺乏舶來品之火柴，遍處的骨頭上的鱗質就是原料，可是這種現成的東西却缺乏專門人才去利用，去發明。囘憶五十年前與外洋關係疏遠時，我們尙且能够目製各種秀麗的衣料物品，可知以自已的原料是能够獨立生產的。因為倚賴舶來品，反而削弱了我們的創造性。現在，亟需要專門人才在這方面多所發明。好像在內地玻璃極度缺乏，小小一片玻璃價値就非常昂貴，自從工業界到內地發展玻璃工業之後，玻璃的生產亦就不成問題了。</p>
<p>以上，就是盧先生所談一席話的大要，盧先生將于日間返重慶，再利西北去繼續工作。香港及南洋各屬將設辦事處以利之工作惟行，這實在是一個當前的急務，深願國人加以重視者。</p>

<h3>血涙話廣州</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>從不斷風傳省港航運恢復交通當中，省港澳輪船公司的金山輪，終於載運着搭客。囘舫到南中國文物精華所聚的刦後羊城去，這次的試航，算是成功了。昨天的下午，這溝通省港交通的天使——金山輪，又隨隨的爬囘了港海，而且還帶來了很多我們不忍目聞的充滿着血淚的故事回來。在這裏，且把大略的情形，介紹出來：</p>
<p>××裏的廣州</p>
<p>十一日的上午，金山輪在晨風吹送中，鼓着碧波，向前猛進，四個鐘頭之後，它巳駛入了，祖國的疆海了。雄踞海隅的虎門，臨風屹立，葡蔔悄然，任憑浩瀚的江水飄打，所有鋼炮，拆卸無餘。再過　新造」又祗見灰燼飛揚，悄無人聲。無伺，船抵省河，首先觸入眼簾的西濠口以至西關一帶，最熱鬧的地方統成焦土。修長的長堤，再沒有珠娘喚渡，遊客閒逛的旖旎風光，祗餘爛舊的汽車和鉄網，堆塞長堤，防人偷渡，省河以南，和靖海路以東，便是一片荒凉，人烟稀少。昔日繁華綺麗的五羊。已變成了灰燼啊！</p>
<p>黑暗的世界</p>
<p>全市精華所聚的，要算帶河基一帶了。千千萬萬的流氓，地痞，搶匪，監犯，以及一切的歹徒，白大都匯流到那裏；人肉的市塲，臟物的總會塲，都設在那裏；賭啦，吹啦，混成一堆，熱關極了。其餘經營柴米和日用必需品的很少，所以這類東西特別昂貴的。</p>
<p>在那裏維持治安的，除了×軍外，有的是自警團。這些自警團完全是些「仙風道骨」這一類人物，別說拿不到賊人，而且他們也在多方面的想辦法去發財呀！一到了薄暮黃昏，人影絕跡，×軍也歸巢窠，搶匪盜賊，便四出活動，殺人越貨，倒像家常便飯。任是大皇老子，也不敢出來干預這種事的。聽說在十五晚，大基頭附近的住戶竟有百餘家被刦那裏的恐怖情形、可見一斑、所以有「日中×軍晚上賊人」的兩句俗諺！</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××</p>
<p>逼用×幣</p>
<p>逗留廣州的同胞，除去了一切都受着『特殊』的待遇外，還須要循循順順的使用×帶。泉皇的告示，貼在街頭，那些拿到香港來，是不值一文的『軍用票』但在那里，大洋要給加三的匯率，毫券則每元要用一塊八毫，若有半個不字，隨便的給你一個『歧視×幣』，那末，你的腦袋便準會搬家的的！</p>
<p>一個有趣的故事</p>
<p>在我軍反攻廣州聲中，和在我們英勇的游擊隊神出鬼沒的襲擊當中，×軍眞是提心吊胆，夢魂驚擾的，聽說駐在鳳凰崗那邊的×軍，因為地瀕山野，到晚未凄厲的北風。撥着野草，沙沙有聲，×人從夢中驚醒，便以為是游擊隊來了，免不了一陣恐慌，如是庸人自擾，不知多少次，於是×軍便决。把所有的野草，焚燒凈盡，免留後禍。誰知不燒猶可，一燒就大禍臨頭。原因是那裏埋藏着兩個還未爆發的炸彈，給火種燃着藥線，轟隆一聲，百幾個×軍，便肢解體裂的飛舞胸中，經過這次的轟炸後，孤身的×軍，更不敢遠行一步，這是一件怎樣滑稽的事啊！</p>
<p>又聞×陸軍興海軍裂痕甚深，海軍方面發出艇艇渡族幟，每被×陸軍撕毀，并予各艇家以不利，至各艇戶的領有陸軍通過旗幟的，亦常被×海軍拒絕通過，故各艇戶每於行駛河面時，則用海軍旗幟，將泊岸時則改用陸軍旗幟，以應付此無可奈何環境，但雖如此，仍時遭橫禍呢。</p>
<p>最後，有很多事實，都不能筆錄出來的，這自然是一個遺憾。不過我相信大家看到了上述的事實，一面是羞回廣州，一囘是懷念廣州，末了，必定是切志掃除這一切一切的黑暗，重回廣州的啊！</p>

<h3>梧柳途中日記</h3>
<p>— 蕭雯</p>
<p>廿七年十月廿五日　困居梧地近十日、又以時局幻變、逼走他鄉、由梧赴柳之船甚稀、因時過三春水漲之期、逆流水淺、雖用小汽輪拖走、五一之途、需五四之時日、且風傳當局封船、一去無返、船隻多不肯行、止於象縣石龍、過此則逆求橫流、倍多險阻、不如轉車赴柳、較爲穩妥、此地此日、風聲草木、避走者多於船隻十倍、四處設法始定得艙位多只、船名民富、用汽輪拖行、因裝貨關係、啓行在子夜、於是稍得充分時間、收拾行李、然才住不足十日之新屋、整齊方定、一旦又須捨之而去、粗重者不能携行、流亡人之舌、　如此也、至晚因傳十二時後梧山戒嚴、於十時午亟雇担夫將行李担赴碼頭、不意民富渡已滿載旅客、雖預定艙座、然行李繁雜、無法處置、隙地都爲捷足者先得、即地下亦到處是人、幾無揷足之所、乃設法塞藏行李、其餘則誧疊艙上、形同城堡、忙碌之餘、大汗一身矣、幸船卽開行、江風吹來、到是人好淸爽散、囘首岸際、燈火零星、旬日梧州又行吿別、深夜倦勞、倒身而睡、不復知身之在船中矣、</p>
<p>十月廿六日　夢中醒來、不知東方之已白、少頃船停、曰「到藤縣矣」、有客上、大部　學生返鄕者、無置身處、僅將行李堆置船沿、而坐身具上、藤縣爲我前臨之區、近且有友人等瞥留該地、遠望　際、不勝滄桑之概、船行江中、尙平穩、無異屋居、然全行者吳君姊妹兩人、竟病船、不食少飲、莫識其由、沿途經濛江白馬兩地、均有上落　人擠不堪、船中無聊、依窗有山、粤西風光、不同他處、然梧藤尙非桂省秀勝之區、且數度經此、不覺具奇險、篋中帶有托爾斯泰復活譯本、讀閱盡之、不知船人以飯進也、黃昏、船泊江口、江口者係土人俗稱、實即大湟口也、有小艇靠泊叫賣、爲糕、餅、柚、橙、之屬、買者極衆、船中貨少而　也、是夜無風、悶熱、船泊江心不行、恐沿途灘險、夜行不易耳、</p>
<p>十月廿七日　晨至桂平、桂平爲水路一大埠、落容較多、將行　栘置地下、得以稍可伸脚、途中沙灘屢見、有延綿數里者、荒凉無用、惟山水較可、可以遠眺、亦可以平視、粤西山水之奇、至此始秀、徐　客所謂「轉流成穴」之水勢、乃得見其眞面目、小艇過此、倒行橫流、不免於傾沉、前人謂之死地、深藏荒蠻之區、諒不謬也、晚泊武宣、飯後風起、稍得冷趣、天忽雨、船頂漏水、淋及睡榻、到處全是、無法佈置、卷被縮足、終夜未得好睡、不勝苦况、</p>
<p>十月廿八日　早九時許到石　矣、上岸、石階甚高、凡數十級、據云大水時僅露數級、則水　之態、可以想像、入鎭、以當日乏車赴柳、暫宿旅店、簡陋之狀、令人不堪居、惟數日困頓、得一杯淸荼、作甘露飲、小店亦勝於船居也、</p>
<h3>上海北站的貨運　路員稅吏重重剝榨　運費分等別有用心</h3>
<p>（上海通訊）自從淪陷了的京滬、滬杭兩條鐵道、侵略者在軍運之餘、允許搭客和運貨以後、斷垣殘壁、死寂了的北火車站、又有一點子熱　了、</p>
<p>過去、替這個大都市—上海、負起貨物吸進吐出重任的、在鐵路方面、有麥根路車站、北站、日暉港卓站、和南站、現在南站是完全被封鎖着、麥根路車站、雖然很早就傳說不久要開放、但是至今還沒有實現、日暉港車站因爲佔有在黃浦江邊的使利、有一點貨物在卸車、但是沒有東西起運、原因是、到現在還沒有得到允許、除此只有北火車站了、現在只有北站、是比較的忙碌和熱閙、它有貨物裝出去、亦有東西運進來、</p>
<p>裝到北站來的貨物、卸車情形、一般的說來、是和過去沒有多大異樣、只是卸下來的貨物、沒有棧房堆、只好堆在露天空地上、還有侵略者曾經用作罵我中國沒有組織的一種藉口、認爲最不合理的稅收—釐金、取銷以後、好幾年不見了的收稅員、現在在侵略者的槍刺上、一批簇新的人物、又站了起來、向每一件貨物伸手要錢、</p>
<p>貨物起運的情形、是絕不像過去那　的簡單和順利、如果有貨物要連出去、必先要前幾天去登記、管理登記的人允許你登記以後、就給你一張像豆腐干一樣大小的「貨位證」、上面寫明允許你把貨物車到北站來的日期、到了那個指定的日期、你才可以把物車去、但是、事前還要拿了這張「貨位證」、到管理貨位的人那裏去、要他指派一個位置、這時候如果你光是拿一張「貨位證」去、是不會得到位置的、必須嬰附去五元或十元法幣、才能如願以償、管理貨位的人允許了你位置以後、就在這張「貨位證」上、註明貨位的號碼、這樣才算手續完備、你可把你的貨物、帶到指派的貨位上去安放、要是沒有得到管理貨位人的計可、這一張登記時所發的「貨位證」是等於廢紙、不要說沒有位置給你堆放、就是守車場柵門的兵士、亦不會讓你帶着貨物通過、　北站在八一三以前、就因爲棧房太少、常常有許多待運的貨物、堆放在露天、成是棧房外的馬路上、戰後、這稀少的棧房、毀的毀了、剩下來的、又大半不肯公開堆放貨物、所以你雖然化了幾塊錢去買得來的貨　、亦僅僅是露天一塊空地罷了、</p>
<p>貨物堆放在貨位上以後、再去要求派車子裝、這亦須要化上二三十元莫明其妙的錢、否則卽使擱上幾天、亦不會派到車子、而華人辨的轉運公司、又不能直接要求派軍子、非得要轉託×籍運輸公司、最低限度、亦得雇用幾個××人、這當然又得化上許多寃枉錢、還有、運出去的貨物、須要有「採辦證」、而大多數華人所辦的轉連公司、都無從領得、只得臨時每一車出二三十元、向別人轉買、</p>
<p>運貨的計算、過去是很詳細的分爲六等、現在只約略的改分做三等、但是、不滿整車是不分等級的、</p>
<p>絹、綢緞、雜貨、等是一等運價、</p>
<p>人造絹、綿紗、洋布、土布、蛋、乾繭、麵粉、洋燭、香烟、砂糖、煤、鐵……是二等運價、</p>
<p>棉花、小麥、黃豆、米、鹽……是三等運價、</p>
<p>照上面的分法、我們很明顯的看得出他的作用、運費較便宜的所謂第三等貨物、完全是中國的大宗出產、而是侵略者最迫切需要的凍西、</p>
<p>運費現在從上海到杭州、二等價整車、每噸日幋二元五角五分、到南京三元六角、無錫二元六角、蘇州二　二角、嘉興二元三角五分、松江二元三角、外加裝車力、卸車力等雜費四種、每種每噸一角六分、共六角四分、還有、通　株式會社不論遠近、整車每噸要加牧五角、不滿整車、每担要加收五角、所謂通運株式會社、是鐵路方面的貨運經理人、所有全綫貨運人員的任用、以及開支、全部由他負責、</p>
<p>所有兩路裝貨的車輛、在華軍西退的時候、都帶了去、現在所用的、是從別處運來的車子、每輛十五噸、照十三噸收運費、</p>
<p>因爲車輛的少、因爲車輛的小、所造成的不敷分配、因此華人所開設的轉運公司、不能够直接去要求派車子、因為某些人的目的、是在發橫財、所以、正像各處地方一樣、造成了許許多多敲榨剝削的情形、車站裏邊的「職員」、是拿每天貨物的多少、車輛的多少、來决定他特別費的價目、而　多某國籍的運輸公司或個人、靠他天賦便利派得的車子、不去裝自己的貨、——或者根本沒有貨裝、——用高價像出頂房子一樣的、把它轉讓給倒霉的中國人、</p>
<p>現在、運到北站來的貨物、或是從北站運出去的貨物、都要付原價百分之五的稅、由×「上海市政府」派人駐在那裏收取、那批收稅的小醜、除了敲榨、原本是什麼都不懂、所以在估價的時候、往往任意亂估、你要和他講理、理在那地方根本就沒有的、不過這樣子並不是就算他們「忠於職守」、事情常常是　樣的、　譬如你有一批貨、他要估你三千元的原價、捐一百五十元、講定後、他寫了五十元的捐票、收你五十塊錢、另外的、他只吿訴你在某某地方接洽、那地方常是白渡橋南的大飯店或是旅館裏、有時、說不定竟是妓院、你到上八、九點鐘去、本來還要付他一百塊錢、但是因爲這是入私囊的關係、所以可以打個對折、只要付他五十塊錢就够了、</p>
<p>你在那地方付了錢、如果你要明白他們的錢到那裏去的、只要在那地方四面看一看、就可知道、抽大烟、賭錢、喝酒、玩女人、什麽都全套、收稅的小醜和鐵路上的×籍職員、完全一樣、他們不但刮了錢去自己胡調、有時還要拉了許多轉蓮公司的職員一同去、閙到天亮、使人在物質方面特別付出之外、在精神方面、亦要特別付出一筆、</p>
<p>因爲北站不再死寂了、所以虬江路上打壞了的屋子、亦有人去租借、這一帶的房屋、現在算是被沒收了。、所以租借的時候、是要向「××居留民團」去租、房租每月大約上幾塊錢、但是他交給你的、只是一間破屋子、並不修好、是要你自己去修、因此、有人租了一間屋子、修一修倒化掉了四、五百元、這種租房的情情、亦眞是前所少有、</p>
<p>現在北站的貨運、比較上是相當的忙碌、同時、某種人的口袋、以及飯店、旅館、妓院、煙、賭、酒、亦跟在一起忙碌、而另一方面、亦正是勞工們血和汗的加速底奔流、　（畦夏）</p>

<h3>本地疋頭業概況</h3>
<p>香港疋頭市塲、數十年來、皆爲英、美、法、德、意、俄所獨佔、年中貿易數達千三四百萬元、以香港區區不過一掌之地、推銷能有如斯成績、其數不可謂不巨、迨至八年前、日本國內工業漸吿發達、疋頭由是開始輸運來港推銷、因貨格便宜、欵式新頴、國人乃多利其價廉而物美、爭相購買、日貨在港市場因是逐漸抬頭、歐美疋頭、實質雖較日貨爲佳、無如價格相差過遠、市場遂漸爲日人所蠶食、尢以最近五六年夾、日貨在港市塲、更覺繁榮、竟佔香港疋頭全年貿易額百份之六十、而歐美則反僅得百份之四十而已、至日人運港推銷之貨物、分冬夏兩種、冬以絨口爲大宗、欵式亦最多、次則爲雜絨、棉羽絨等、夏貨則以人造絲織品多數、佔來貨百份之九十、其餘則爲竹沙夾布白洋布葛布等、現目港市所賣之扣布、皆爲日貨、　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　定歐美貨品、故全年歐美運港貨物、已增至三百餘萬元、比諸去年所銷一二百萬元、已相差甚遠、　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　、今年歐美各國來貨、以英德爲最多、意次之、法又次之、最少則爲美國、冬季羢口則有西衣羢、大衣羢、禮服絨線仔羢、光羢、企頭羢、海虎羢等、夏貨則多爲竹紗、夾布、葛布、爽羢、白洋布等、美國則獨以帆布最大宗、來港貨物、除卽在就地推銷外、其中大部運往廣州、福州、廈鬥、汕頭、漢口、長沙、廣州灣及華北一帶銷售、在戰事未發生前、歐美貨運銷廣州年値百餘萬元、日貨則二百餘萬元、福州、漢口、廈門、長沙等地、歐美貨佔百餘萬元、日貨亦佔四百餘萬元、華北一帶因地理關係、則多就近向申定購、故來港定購者甚少、又澳門一地、與港相隔僅不遠、戰前年銷歐美及日貨共百餘萬元、惟戰後中國各地與香港有貿易關係者如天津靑島漢口等地、相繼淪陷、香港疋頭向外推銷、遂逐一减少、及至廣州失陷後、低减竟至百份之八十、現目所餘銷路祇澳門一地、幸今年香港疋頭行所定下之歐美貨二三百萬元、因避難來港者衆、故市塲異常暢銷、定貨已銷去全數七分以上、港中現有之××絲綢店、多爲日人資本、其欲藉以推銷其貨物者、</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>華杯華聯對海聯　李惠堂被邀參戰　華聯陣線亦應有改善</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】　華杯足球初賽第二幕、是華人聯隊對海軍聯隊、本月廿二日（星欺日）下午三時半在香港會塲舉行、</p>
<p>華聯代表、日前已選出、惟因南華舉師征貢、未能及期趕返、祗取錄其留守球員譚均幹梁榮照二人而已、</p>
<p>足球總會對已决定的華聯陣綫、認爲美中不足、蓋誠恐號召力弱、鬥票收入必受影響、因爲此項比賽的門票收入、全歸總會所有的、</p>
<p>總會年中經費、乃賴此項比賽的門票收入以資挹注、尤其是今年、須招待菲律濱隊來港作埠際賽、所需費用更大。</p>
<p>故關於此項初賽、總會固希望華聯能盡選一等球員出而應戰、以宏號召、復希望華聯能得决賽權、蓋總會「生意眼」要緊、遂以全副精神、寄托於華聯方面、</p>
<p>這番華聯代表、未孚衆望、在總會方面尤着急、怕的是華聯一出即敗、則將來决賽、乃由西隊相對壘、華人觀客、定不高興、那末、這筆生意、溢利必少、</p>
<p>爲此、總會某委員力邀李惠堂屆時出助華聯、黃家駿亦居中作冰人、請李氏勉爲其難、免使總會失望、</p>
<p>李氏昨對記者稱、「總會某委員、殷殷相邀、情殊可感、爲吾個人舉足之勞、得以兩全其美、不便推却、但吾旣參與比賽、未悉已决定之華聯陣線、將如同變動　、』</p>
<p>李氏有這樣的表示、必參與比賽無疑、而其一種義助精神、足爲運動界之模範、亦爲一般球迷所樂聞、尤有一點、此次華聯得他參戰、那一出恐被淘汰的危險成份、當爲之減少、</p>
<p>我記得、自中日戰爭以來、旅港之華人足球界、每次舉辨義賽、都得總會贊助、今次麗華杯賽、雖然鬥票收人是盡歸總會、但我們也該得盡量帮他的忙、投桃報李、誼有往還、故李氏此次答允參戰、甚有意思、</p>
<p>巳選出的華聯代表、照理不得推翻、然此次乃設法替總會增加入收起見、則不妨行權、以玉成其事、故記者對華聯屆時應戰的陣線、爲李惠堂參戰而有一個献議</p>
<p>守門一職、日前已選定譚均幹、便不用變動罷、而且李惠堂曾說過、他在過去和老譚同一隊無論參加任何比賽、都未曾失敗過、故可用他們一對幸運的搭擋仍在一起、</p>
<p>右內衛選光華的侯榕生、在目下情形、我認爲滿意、左內衛用苗華國、似非得宜、他近來雖然進步、頭球更好、但舉動過慢已是衆目共見的事實、海聯右翼岩士德郎、十分厲害、恐老苗抵禦不來、用宋靈聖亦不行、無異削足履、而且他很少打過內衞、若用不得當、反爲累事、依我眼光、用羅偉權爲最適合、因爲老羅脚頭够　、每在小型球賽、他都是祖任內　　、以小比大、其義一也、若選他、相信勝任愉快、</p>
<p>正前衛應選梁榮照、而且他近來對于交球一道、頗爲用心、又够氣够勇、右前衛以宋靈聖爲一個意中人物、有球路、善包抄、勝于劉始讚、左前衛則宜用許竟成、若然如此、整個前衛綫、何等堅強、卽使內衛弱些、然得前衛有力掩護、不足爲慮、</p>
<p>左右兩翼、必屬侯澄滔陳炳士二人、當無疑義、所考慮的、惟三位前鋒而已、依我意見、李惠紫旣任中鋒、則必須一個供球良好的內鋒來輔助、李方易於進取、這個供球良好　人物、捨鄒文治莫屬、他在以前又與澄滔合作過、若選他爲左內鋒、必與澄滔有諒解的演出、及定能輔助惠堂進攻、右內鋒頗感材難、然卓石金可以錄用、他的遠射術、更有點像惠堂的作風、</p>
<p>如前線依我意見一樣的選出、敢斷攻力必强、何况惠堂、石金、澄滔都是　射的、必使海聯守將、有顧此失彼之嘆、質之高明、以爲然否、茲將記者献議的陣線錄下、（球塲太歲）</p>
<p>譚均幹　羅偉權　侯榕生　許竟成　　榮照　宋靈聖　侯澄滔　鄒文治　李惠堂　卓石金　陳炳士</p>

<h3>對於深呼吸應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>深呼吸的功效綜合起來、不外下列六種</p>
<p>（一）鍛鍊肺臟、擴張胸部。</p>
<p>（二）潔淨血液、使血液循環正常、强　心臟、</p>
<p>（三）增强各部器官的能力、使其作用活躍而正常、</p>
<p>（四）使精神振奮、氣力强大。</p>
<p>（五）恢復疲勞、使身體鬆弛、治療失眠等症、強健神經系統、</p>
<p>（六）抑壓情感上的衝動、制止暴怒、憂　等、使身心舒暢、促進心靈上的健康、</p>
<p>深呼吸雖然是一種很簡易而砭有效的運動、但是我們對於這種運動如缺乏深切的認識或操之過急、結果不僅不能收獲最大的效果、往往反而受害、</p>
<p>茲將我們對於深呼吸應有的認識分條列舉於下、</p>
<p>（一）我們不宜專以深呼吸運動爲鍛鍊胸部唯一的工具、深呼吸運動應與他種以發達肌肉或鍛鍊氣力爲主的運動、共同舉行、或於此種運動之後、例如在舉行啞鈴運動時、每做完兩三個運動、可行深呼吸約一分鐘；或在全部運動完畢之後、行深呼吸約三分鐘、如在平時行深呼吸運動、則功效較小、因爲在運動時、我們所需要的空氣往往　平時多至七八倍、午時肺臟對於空氣的容量有限、不能接受大量的空氣、如過於勉强反而有害、</p>
<p>在舉行他種運動的時候、也要隨時行深呼吸、否則對於身禮不僅　傷害之虞、並且往往感覺心跳急　、頭暈眼眩、耳鳴以及疲乏無力　現象。</p>
<p>雖有許多運動因需要迅速的動作、往往不能同時行深呼吸、但無論如何、運動或用力的時候、我們不可停止呼吸、不在呼吸困難或急促的時候、暫時可改用口　氣、因爲這樣可以迅速的吸入大量的空氣、</p>
<p>（三）舉行深呼吸雖然不宜過度、但如每日祇行數分鐘、亦無甚功效、我們　時皆須使胸部充滿新鮮空氣、所以我們的身體須有正確的姿勢、以便隨時皆可舉行深呼吸</p>
<p>（四）舉行深呼吸運動、如欲收獲最大的效果、必須注意胸腔、胸部骨骼、肺臟、胸肌、　肩兩部肌肉、以及橫隔膜、使各部作用活躍而正常。</p>
<p>至於深呼吸的方法、我們應注意下列四點、</p>
<p>（一）如非呼吸困難或急促、應用鼻吸氣、用口呼氣。但遇寒風或氣候冷、爲避免受寒計、仍須用鼻吸氣、　勿迎風呼吸、</p>
<p>（二）吸氣時全身肌肉應完全鬆弛、不可緊收或用力、姿勢要自然、</p>
<p>（三）吸氣時腹部儘量漲大、呼氣時腹部儘量縮小、</p>
<p>（四）呼氣時兩臂相交於胸前、用力壓縮胸部、將　中空氣澈底排出、</p>
<p>在運動或用力時必須同時儘量使呼吸深長和澈底方能避免傷害、但在這個時候要使呼吸深長和澈底、首先要注意的就是正確的呼吸方法、運動時呼吸的方法不外下列兩種、</p>
<p>（一）用力時吸氣鬆弛時呼氣</p>
<p>（二）胸腹兩部受壓縮時呼氣、擴張時吸氣、</p>
<h3>南華遠征隊初次敗績</h3>
<p>南華足球隊、自出師征西貢後、所向披靡、戰訊迭誌前、惟該會昨日上午接到該隊由西貢來電、據謂、于（十六）日與當地南圻甲隊比賽、以一比三敗績、南華獲球者爲劉松生、</p>
<h3>乒乓聯賽</h3>
<p>學際乒乓賽、今晚按表七時仿分對九龍、八時半仿林戰華南、均假東方會乒乓室舉行、届時兩軍角逐、當有一番劇戰、</p>
<h3>女籃球賽今晚三場舉行</h3>
<p>普通女子籃球賽、今晚六時半起、共有三塲舉行、首塲南華戰港大、工力悉敵、次場華僑定勝　花、尾場保羅抗思思、思思可操勝券</p>
<h3>越野賽跑　領號碼前尙可報名</h3>
<p>第一屆全港華人公開越野賽跑、已於昨日下午八時止截報名、茲爲普及起見、在領取號碼前、亦可報名參加、檢驗體格、定今日起至星期五止、男賽跑員檢驗處（油　地彌敦道三百三十五號）彭學高醫生、女賽跑員則在（佐敦道三十三號）馮慶友醫生醫務處、時間、每日下午四時至六時、昨仿林送出銀杯一只、　道、養中、則送出顧　三角旗各二面云、</p>
<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……社會暴徒</p>
<p>The　Last　Gangster</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱孫、扮演一個爲非作歹的暴徒、在他過往作品中的成功、証明他是一個傑出的人才、他那出神入化的演技、刻畫入微的性格表演、博得了每一個觀衆異口同聲的讚許、</p>
<p>在本片中、他冉飾一個無惡不作的暴徒、殺人越貨頑視國法、更操縱着整個社會的惡勢力、叱咤風雲、驕橫放縱、不可一世、而終爲著賢妻愛子的緣故、犧性一切、以及自己的性命、得到一個極悲慘的下場、</p>
<p>愛德華在本片中的演技、處處迸着大才的火花、有着一種非常的動人力景、台演的有詹姆史蒂華露絲史屈南、同時在本片中、我們還看到好萊塢一張最完美的賊匪演昌表、這一部「社會暴徒」中所有的緊張動人的情節將給與觀衆大量而强烈的新刺激、</p>
<p>皇后……頑童學戲記</p>
<p>由湯姆凱萊領銜及一輩頑童班合作的長篇滑稽片、是湯姆繼『頑童小傳』之後的作品、但因故事關係、顯見沒有前一部來得能感動人、可是導演對本片處理很活潑生動、幾個噱頭地方、尙能令人滿意、馬戲班各項表演都很精彩、一輩童星的演出都很出色、終之不失一本娛樂性的片子、</p>
<p>平安……俠兄破賊記</p>
<p>North　of　the　Rfo　Grande</p>
<p>是威廉杯繼「俠友戲賊記」之後的作品、同是描寫美國西部俠客加薛地的故事、這一次是因爲他的兄弟被劫匪槍殺、在法庭上未能伸寃、加薛地報仇心切、扮作賭棍、泯跡賭窟、暗中偵査眞兇、經過再三的險阻、方得爲弟報仇、幷代西部除一大害、情節相當曲折、威廉杯在本片中、也有較上片更精彩的演出、</p>
<p>東方……邊關飛將</p>
<p>Border　Flight</p>
<p>一張寫緝私的影片、故事平淡、就裏幾幕與盜匪在空中博鬥那些塲面、還相當刺激動人、佛蘭茜絲福瑪及約翰約霍華、演出平平、</p>
<p>大華……子夜琴聲</p>
<p>Moonlight　Sonata</p>
<p>是一部音樂愛情片、値得注意的就是有所負盛名的鋼琴家彼得魯斯基、Padreswskf、令片結構、皆以彼得魯斯基的鋼琴演奏作爲故事中心、在音樂會中、他那出神入化的藝術、感動了全塲的聽衆、尤其是一對靑年夫妻、經聽衆要求而再奏「子夜琴聲」一曲、接着他口述一對靑年夫婦怎樣在愛情破裂的時候、受「子夜琴聲」一曲所感化、重好如初、也就是本片的故事、</p>
<p>彼得魯斯基的　術、値得歡賞外、情節上在演出上則略　沉悶、對白多於動作、脫不了英國片的作風、却爾斯福雷、已失却當年瀟洒神釆、</p>
<p>景星……小巧姐</p>
<p>Always　Fn　Trouble</p>
<p>一貫的作風、態度的聰明玲來撮合人家姻緣、最後遊艇比賽、又發笑又緊張、金蕙漱演出甚佳、</p>
<p>中央……話劇</p>
<p>中華藝術團</p>
<p>日演……得意忘形</p>
<p>夜演……雷雨</p>
<p>新世界……鬥氣夫妻</p>
<p>夸語片</p>
<p>太平……粤劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>
<p>日演……未必男兒盡無情</p>
<p>夜演……荷包郡主</p>
<p>普慶……粤劇</p>
<p>興中華劇團</p>
<p>日演……西施情困趙子龍</p>
<p>夜演……苦命三公孫</p>
<p>北河……粤劇</p>
<p>錦添花女劇團</p>
<p>日演……薛丁山</p>
<p>夜演……粉粧樓二本</p>

<h3>動與靜</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>——戰地旅行雜感</p>
<p>一個晴明的初冬的早晨，我獨自從鵝湖書院沿斜塔爬上峯頂山的高峯；朝陽初出，濃霧彌谷，路旁的白茶花蒙着露潤，顯得格外有生氣。那天，也不知由於這有名的哲學家——朱陸二氏勝會之地，引起我的懷古之念？還是由於這冷情肅穆的初冬氣氛，激刺我的冥想？胸中總覺得有點異樣，默默的想，緩緩的走，想到朱陸當年在此論學，各有異同，他們携手同行，有時無言，有時激辯，有時心契，不知他們也想到千百年後，由同得異，由異歸同，別開許多壯闊波瀾否？</p>
<p>正當冥想神會之際，六中軋軋飛機之聲，打斷了我的思路；其時，我忽轉一念，提出這樣的問題：假使朱熹和陸象山都生在現代。和朱陸都立一部分異的呂祖謙（金華學派大師）也來到鵝湖參加討論；三人舌辯風生，各不相下的時候，×人的飛機飛來了，他們三人的態度究竟怎樣？這倒是極耐人思索的。陸象山也許正襟危坐，神色少變，未熹也許想到聖人行權之道以及「君子不立於巖牆之下」的古訓，呂祖謙呢，大概立刻停止參加辯論，覺得挖防空檺比哲理辯論切於實際。飛機過後；誰是誰非，又可以寫破每人的筆尖；但若鵝湖書院中的弟子是現在正在唸書的靑年，他們判斷立刻可以定下來，因爲他們相信×人的飛機眞會投下炸彈來，把正襟危坐的陸九淵炸成肉餅的，他們會覺得金華學派所走現實的路是正路。</p>
<p>下山時，斜塔的頂尖又觸動我另一種心念：鵝湖書院，這儒家的聖地，和峯頂山宏濟寺，那佛家聖地，她們之間又怎麽一種交涉？難道山脚的斜塔，就算爾疆我境的分水綫，彼此不會側目互睨嗎？或者陸象山的態度，比較接近峯頂山那一邊，朱熹則屬於鵝湖書院的圈子，呂祖謙則在鵝湖的圈子以外、他們的弟子對於山寺沙彌的態度，尤有根本的不同之處。這樣推尋下去，這問題越是複雜；那天早晨，我的心頭，就成熟了一種人生哲學，亂世的人生哲學。</p>
<p>在峯頂山與鵝湖之間，其基本上有絕不相同的生命觀；佛家主張靜的美，以「湼般」為生命的歸宿，儒家主張動的美，以「自強不息」為「變易」的大道，陸偏於佛，故主「明心見性」，朱偏於儒，故主「窮理處事」，呂祖謙葉水心陳同甫以及清初顏李學派，更近於儒，故主「閱歷世事，窮究經濟」。（經濟指民主經濟而言。）靜的美，容易體會人到中年更懂得閒靜安適的味兒。動的美卻非有正面對着現實的勇氣不能領略；跟着動而來的，擺在眼前便是亂得一團糟的現實，過慣着安閑生活的人，只知道一團糟只是和他的生活秩序開玩笑，什麼舊的法程，都不能讓他好好兒應付，動亂就使他頭痛，不斷的頭痛。等到他曉得動亂之下，活躍着生命之流，那生侖之流又飛躍着向前面去，又使他覺得頭痛了，此所以朱熹局居於鵝湖之圈中，而儒家也只苟全於中庸之道。處在亂世「中庸」是不够的，得有一副更積極的人生態度。</p>

<h3>死</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>死，最痛苦，也最難得。因此一般人對終死的觀念，有的是咒咀，有的是讚美。</p>
<p>死最痛苦，是客覜的，「生人作死別，恨恨那可論，」換句話說：祗有生者纔會感到死的痛苦。死最難得，是主觀的，人人都怕死，而你能够拋棄一切，勇於趨死，便爲難得，所以死有輕於鴻毛，有重如泰山。不當死而死，不必死而死，則輕於鴻毛：當死纔死，必死敢死，則重如泰山。前者的死，因爲死的不得其所，不獨不能換取社會的同情，相反的，因爲他留給一個不良的印象，還要遭着社會的唾罵。後者的死，因爲他死得其所，給人家的是忠貞節烈的，足爲後死者效法的故事，所以値得歌頌。</p>
<p>在這抗戰的　流中，死的故事也太多啦—前方的將士，爲了民挨，爲了國家，爲了正義，整千整萬的死在戰神之前，他們是中華民國的死士，是正義公理的先導。他們這種壯烈犧牲的偉績，視死如歸的精神，歷史是不會不鄭重記述的；這且按下不說。在淪陷區也多着引頸就義的故事和陳屍街　的醜聞，這許多的死，非但有輕重之別，而且有順逆之分。</p>
<p>據本報的泰縣通訊：鎮江敎育家曾任丹徒縣勸學所所長，鎭江縣敎育局長之徐師竹，鎭江大港鄕人，道德文章，夙爲鄕黨及社會人士所推崇，近因其胞侄徐某在該鄉附逆。力勸脫離不從，認爲奇恥大辱，竟於日前在新洲地方，投江殉國，世之甘心作漢奸者，應當愧死，聞徐某得悉乃　投江殉國之訊，頗有悔意云。</p>
<p>徐師竹爲了胞侄附逆，勸止無效，而投江殉國，不僅明恥，亦且明志；這種行爲，當然感人至深，彌堪崇敬！然而，他的死，固然有相當的價値，但他以這種死諫的方法企圖換取他那不肖胞侄悔意，是尙有討論的餘地。</p>
<p>漢奸是沒有靈魂的，他們不曉得什麽　做廉恥，什麽叫做氣節，我們對於這班衣冠禽獸，民族罪人，唯一的辦法便是「殺無赦」，勸阻規諫，是無用的；徐師竹先生旣然有死的勇氣在「力勸脫離不從」的敎訓下，對於他那不肖胞侄，倘然不能加以白刃，置之於死地，爲國家除一敗類，爲天地間爭一點止氣，儘可以發動廣泛的除奸運動，促醒一般淪陷區同胞的覺悟，如果因此而招致死的後果，那麽死得更有價値，更爲難得了。</p>
<p>所以，我們認識：我們要有死的勇氣，同時要有索取死的代價的死志。</p>
<h3>我愛火光</h3>
<p>— 羅昔</p>
<p>我愛野火會在黑夜里燃放起萬丈光芒，它能照明：誰是眞正的人類，誰是人面的豺狼！</p>
<p>火雖會焚燬繁華的城市，火會會焚燬秀麗的山莊；但這是新與舊的交替，並不是永久的災荒！</p>
<p>到處也會跑來吃人的豺狼，到處也會冲起野火的光芒；誰也沒有地方可以逃避，可以躱藏！</p>
<p>大地上，萬萬千千被壓迫的兒女們已對着冲天的火光齊聲歌唱：</p>
<p>「只有抵抗，才有解放！我們的意志就是堅强的哨崗；我們的拳頭就是无比的刀槍！」</p>
<p>向着兇野的豺狼，萬萬千千的人們已匯成一片滔天的巨浪。他們會把豺狼壓下尸骨堆成的山崗，他們會把渣滓浸入熱血流成的江洋；在野火消熄以後，他們更會在染着血與肉的大地上建起更繁華的城市；造起更秀麗的山莊！</p>
<p>是的，我愛火光！</p>
<h3>新會橘子</h3>
<p>— 吳重翰</p>
<p>新會的出產品，全要的有兩種，一是蒲葵，一就是橘子。</p>
<p>新會的橘子，味淸甘，過冬後，別有一番惹人的芬香，這就是橘香，嶺南人皆嗜之。橘子古今馳名，屈大夫早已有橘頌之作，惜此菓易於腐爛，不能久藏而行遠，所以銷路不出粤東。</p>
<p>每年重九時節，橘子便上市了，初時色靑，已而轉黃，已而逞轉黃金色，這時橘子已到成熟時期了，凡嶺南人，尤其是新會的孩子們，誰個不愛上了橘子？</p>
<p>日前，雲姐從新會來，間關道阻，送給我兩　橘子，金色　　，粲然奪目，我萬二分感謝她，在逃難的時候，還如此殷勤，過水涉山，辛辛苦苦的帶來這兩筐橘子。</p>
<p>『都是不値錢的東西，有什麽可感謝呢？』</p>
<p>雲姐陡覺凄然，我幾乎誤會了，以爲她脫客氣話。</p>
<p>雲姐以耕橘爲案。這是她祖宗的家傳。已歷幾代了，新會以這爲職業的很多，大者耕橘白數十畝，小者則數畝，若遇豐年，無水旱風雨之災，耕者頗能獲利，大可成富翁，小亦可糊口。新會人賴此以爲生，與業葵者相同，今年適是豐年，榖稻豐收，橘子也豐收。</p>
<p>『橘子豐收不値錢！」</p>
<p>在悲憤的語調之下，我明白雲姐的意思了。</p>
<p>「往年橘子　斤，値五六塊錢，價高時達十塊廿塊。今年僅値一塊多；甚至幾角，也無人過問。賤極了！爛賤貨，不值錢！」</p>
<p>雲姐還往下說出橘子所以賤原因的：</p>
<p>「完全由於×賊南犯，廣州陷了，橘子沒有銷路。往外的路途又處處封鎖了，新會的橘子，只有新會人吃」。</p>
<p>又感歎的說：</p>
<p>「一年勞苦，成了個空！本錢賠了—橘子太賤，摘下來賣，得不到錢，還費工夫。任它在樹上，熟了，爛了，落了，田也弄髒了。耕橘的人破產了！有些耕橘的人爲着飢寒交迫，竟聽了他人愚弄，把橘子秘密運到廣州去，希望撈回一筆本錢。然而，這種行爲，與漢奸何異？就是餓死，也不要做個×奴鬼！」</p>
<p>雲姐還在憤慨不已。我知道他們今年耕橘的難苦。然而×騎縱橫，誰個能够避免重個難苦？</p>
<p>『國難當前，變幻自多如今不比往日昇平時節。</p>
<p>今年笑臉見爺娘，</p>
<p>滿樹黃金橘子香。</p>
<p>已聽慣了你們了這個歌謠了。」</p>
<p>「我們今天已不是這個腔子！」</p>
<p>「怎麽？」</p>
<p>「變改了！」</p>
<p>「什麽腔子？」</p>
<p>「今朝橘子誰摘採？</p>
<p>滿樹黃金，滿眶眼淚！」</p>
<p>雲姐講到這裏時，又滿眶眼淚了！</p>
<h3>行軍瑣記</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>這老頭兒從前是私塾出身的，當年靑時，在外面也很跑了些年，混了些事情，藉着這點淵源，使得我們之間就因爲能够談得來，而減去一般鄕下人對於士兵們的憎惡；眞的，他對於我們，從未現出厭煩的樣子，或是像一般鄉下人那般，故意爲難地硬說你不該多使水，不該弄汚了地，或是估用了竹竿。這老頭兒他才不—由於他對於抗戰的理解的原故，他不但不處處爲雖，反而很愛護這些穿軍服的弟兄。</p>
<p>『不再多住幾天了麽』？還像有些戀戀不捨的樣子。他的老伴，那天天給我們洗衣服的老太婆從內室走出來，彷彿已經聽到了我們的談話，加進來說道：</p>
<p>『同志』……她是把兩個字早就說熟了的，『你們就要開拔麽？』</p>
<p>『是的』。</p>
<p>『沒有好好招待你們』。</p>
<p>『那裏的話，我們可是打擾你們了』。</p>
<p>『不必客氣了』，老頭兒揷上咀，搖了搖他的羽扇，『若是太平年間可請都謂不來呢』。</p>
<p>『開到麽子地方去』？</p>
<p>關于這問題，我們一向是不能把眞話吿訴別人的，由于漢奸太多，卽更是好人，也不能不提防，因而行軍的行程，無論誰問起來，回答出的總是『先到前面』再說，用這話支吾過去了。</p>
<p>前半部的行軍路程單，大家夥已經知這了，『迴龍街—方家坪—舊河街—道觀河—陶家舖—白果—草鞋店—麻城—武家河—西道河—黃土崗—張店—福田河—柳樹店—」</p>

<h3>The Concretization of British Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>The antagonism between Britain and Japan in the Pacific, and even in the world, is absolutely irreconcilable. Although for several years, some people in Japan have been pursuing the "old dream of the Anglo-Japanese alliance," and Britain, as the "Manchester Guardian" stated, "in the past eight or nine years, British officials rarely clearly stated their opinions," allowing Japanese fascists to incite anti-British sentiment. Now, Britain, for two reasons, has concretely demonstrated its attitude and determination towards Japan: one is the deteriorating situation in East Asia after the Guangdong-Hankou War; the other is the United States, a pivotal player on the Pacific political stage, resolutely adopting a tough attitude and sanctions against Japan.</p>
<p>Britain's determination to take a tough stance and active action against Japan is comprehensively expressed in this note to Japan. Britain certainly respects diplomatic etiquette and diplomatic language, but in this note, the wording is very strong and specific. The content of this note includes three key points: first, it points out the various conspiracies actually carried out by Japanese aggressors in China; second, it completely denies the "changes caused by force" by Japan and Japan's unilateral abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty; third, it states that China's politics were gradually stabilizing and its economy was developing before the Japanese war of aggression. These arguments are powerful arguments for exposing the international deception of the aggressors. We are greatly gratified and expectant about the impact of Britain's attitude on safeguarding international justice and treaties.</p>
<p>Britain's specific expression this time was certainly influenced by several tough notes from the United States to Japan, but the issuance of the British note will inevitably increase the United States' stronger determination, because whether the United States can implement the plan to sanction Japan depends on whether the Pacific policies of Britain and the United States can be "parallel" and whether the two can effectively cooperate on the international stage. Britain's tough stance towards Japan can also promote France's tough policy towards Japan, because France not only needs to view British and American policies as decisive in its actions in the East, but also needs Britain to support it in the West to stop the joint attack of German and Italian aggressors. It is said that the British note was submitted to Washington and Paris in advance and issued with the consent of the US and French governments, so its power will be even greater, because the US and France have a moral obligation to cooperate with Britain in sanctioning Japan. If Japan "continues to turn a deaf ear," the US and France will definitely cooperate with Britain to take retaliatory sanctions against Japan, as predicted by the "Daily Mail."</p>
<p>This British ultimatum is different from ordinary notes, as speculated by diplomatic circles in London, it is a "final warning" to Japan. If Japan ignores it again, Britain, the United States, and France will unite and take active economic sanctions. Britain's tough stance this time has another important force, that is, it has the support and supervision of national public opinion. The "Manchester Guardian" commented harshly, saying, "We have only one serious criticism of the British note to Japan, that is, its presentation came too late," and also said, "This time's striking surprise is indeed very admirable." The British people, especially merchants who have close ties with British interests in China, and members of parliament who represent the will of the people, have long been earnestly demanding that the British government adopt a tough policy towards Japan to protect its due interests. Although there is some doubt that the British government is too late in implementing the will of the people, the British government, which has always adopted prudent and reliable diplomatic steps, will certainly be able to implement the determination of the "final warning" expressed in this note in the future.</p>
<p>However, it can be predicted that Britain will not receive a satisfactory reply from Japan and a solution to the problem. Although the Japanese government has not yet made an official reply, Japanese public opinion has expressed great indignation, and its criticism of Britain has become more absurd. As pointed out by the "Hochi Shimbun," "Britain must have lost its senses." The "Nichinichi Shimbun" put forward more specific opinions, saying, "If Britain continues to support Chiang, Japan will have no choice but to regard it as a major enemy." Before the British note exposed Japan's conspiracy, the "Hochi Shimbun" still stubbornly argued, "The stationing of troops is due to the request of the pseudo-organization." This inferior skill of burying one's head in the sand is truly "losing its senses." The evolution of Anglo-Japanese relations in the future should be as we predicted before the establishment of the Hiranuma cabinet: although the culprit of anti-British sentiment, Interior Minister Suetsugu, has left the government, Anglo-Japanese relations cannot be adjusted as a result.</p>
<p>In our opinion, Britain has been rejected and scolded by Japan for a long time, and the interests of Britain and Japan are irreconcilable. Britain either does not uphold its own rights and interests in the Far East, or now is the most appropriate and powerful time.</p>
<p>Not only the United States and France have expressed their sincerity in cooperating with Britain, but even the Netherlands may join. The pressure of this group on Japan will make it impossible for Japan to survive. Even German naval experts admit that "the military strength of Britain and the United States in the Pacific is far superior to that of Japan. In terms of economy, Britain and the United States actually control most of Japan's exports, and Japan's exports are Japan's economic lifeline." This is exactly the same as the conclusion we often discussed before. At a minimum, Britain should have the courage to take the lead in implementing "punitive tariffs," abolish Japan's rights under the most-favored-nation clause, or go a step further and completely prohibit the import of Japanese goods into Britain and its colonies.</p>
<h3>Review of Japan's Domestic and Foreign Situation</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>The Japanese cabinet has recently been reorganized, the culprit who launched the Lugouqiao Incident, Konoe, has collapsed, and as our war of resistance enters the second new stage, this political change in Japan is nothing less than a very good gift that the [Japanese?] gave us in the twenty-eighth year of the new year. It can also be said that it is a great gift from our soldiers who fought bloody battles on the front line. The reorganization of the Japanese cabinet clearly exposes the failure of the war of aggression, because the Chinese sacred war of resistance for one year and six months has forced the [Japanese?] to the final juncture.</p>
<p>On the day Hiranuma took office on the 5th, his first statement was that he admitted that Japan was in an unprecedented emergency. It is not easy to overcome the current difficulties. Hiranuma thought that if the Japanese people could unite under the leadership of their Emperor, it might be possible. From Hiranuma's statement, we know clearly that Japan is at the end of its rope. Can they unite? Impossible. If they could unite, Konoe would not have to step down, and Hiranuma would not have to take office.</p>
<p>Why did the Konoe cabinet collapse and resign? The immediate cause was that the military wanted to implement the general mobilization plan, but Konoe repeatedly expressed his disapproval and wanted to realize it as soon as possible. Therefore, due to the inconsistency of opinions, Konoe was forced to step down. In this sense, it expresses the struggle between Japanese financial groups, capitalists, and fascist military circles. The structure of the Japanese state and all production are controlled by financial groups and capitalists. The fascist military officials, however, wanted to seize control and let them dominate. Since the September 18th Incident until now, they have been fighting openly and secretly.</p>
<p>We should know that Konoe is a nobleman promoted by Saionji himself. He is the spokesperson of financial parties and capitalists. The policies of financial parties towards the invasion of China are different from those of fascist military officials. The financial groups wanted to invade China without bloodshed and by means of economic exploitation. The military officials were not satisfied with this peaceful exploitation, so they launched a large-scale war of aggression. As a result of one and a half years of war of resistance, Japan has fallen into a very serious crisis. The financial groups want to stop at the right time and end the war early, and the military officials also want to fight a quick battle and make a quick decision. However, their political conspiracies and strategies for a quick battle have been defeated by us. The military officials had no choice but to expand the war and intensify the aggression.</p>
<p>The Japanese financial groups have completely lost the power to control the fascist military officials. We can also know that the Japanese military officials are a crazy horse, and this horse-drawn chariot of Japan will definitely hit the cliffs. All the cliffs belong to the 400 million compatriots of the Republic of China. Therefore, Hiranuma's statement when he took office is a reflection of the phenomenon of division. The Hiranuma cabinet is likely to be a short-lived cabinet. Not only that, but also Japanese imperialism, ××××××××××.</p>
<p>The seven demands that Itagaki proposed to Hiranuma are nothing more than wanting to destroy China wholeheartedly. Because of the failure of a political conspiracy dream on December 2 last year, the fascist military officials further proposed a plan to expand military preparations, strengthen the axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and mobilize the whole country. This clearly shows that the Japanese imperialists are moving further down the road to ruin. To expand military preparations, economic strength is essential. What is the state of the Japanese economy since the war of resistance? Since the July 7th Incident the year before last, the military budget has been increased repeatedly, already reaching 3.95 billion, and last year it was 6 billion. According to general estimates, Japan's daily military expenditure is at least 500 million. From the estimate, the [Japanese?] have spent about 10 billion in the past year and a half. The Japanese relied on issuing a large number of public bonds to support such a large military expenditure. After the July 7th Incident, they originally planned to issue 3.5 billion, but only 1.5 billion was issued. As a result of the promotion, only 455 million yuan was collected. Because of the failure to issue public bonds, the huge military expenditure could not be remedied, so taxes were increased and banknotes were issued. Recently, one yuan has fallen below two mao. Therefore, the phenomenon of war-weariness in Japan is very common, but the fascist military officials continue to deceive the people and squeeze the people. The general public can only pray for the end of the war every day.</p>
<p>Their attempt to strengthen the axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy is clearly to expand the world war. In fact, Italy is unable to take care of itself and certainly has no power to aid Japan, and Germany will never send troops to aid Japan in the war. The so-called strengthening of the axis is only to restrain other countries in Europe. As for the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France, Britain's important lifeline is in the East. Now that the [Japanese?] have imposed a restriction on them, Britain will never cooperate with Japan. In fact, Britain has given us new loans, which gives the [Japanese?] an added difficulty. Speaking of the United States, President Roosevelt is advocating the amendment of the Neutrality Act, which means restricting the transportation of military supplies to the aggressor countries. The superiority of Japan's military strength relies on foreign countries. Roosevelt wants to amend the Neutrality Act, and the reason is also to restrict Japan and sanction Japan. The United States has always been friendly to China. Secretary of State Hull has warned American businessmen that Japan must pay cash for military supplies, so Japan has long lost credit in the hearts of Americans. As for France, it conducts its foreign policy based on the attitude of Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prisoners of War Participating in the Work of the New Fourth Army</h3>
<p>— Yan Su, Special Correspondent of Bao Ben, from Southern Anhui</p>
<p>I don't know how many guerrillas there were. In less than ten minutes of the battle, I was injured and fainted on the ground. Later, I was awakened by the sound of the call to return to the team. (Only afterwards did I know that this was the sound of the call of the New Fourth Army) Before long, I was captured by the Chinese people and handed over to the New Fourth Army. (Question) What were your feelings when you were captured? (Answer) When I was captured, my eyes were slightly injured, and I thought there was no hope of survival. Because the officers told us that Chinese soldiers would kill Japanese prisoners of war, but after being here for three days and talking with a New Fourth Army comrade who spoke Japanese, I realized that the actual situation was not like this. I have been here for three months, and I have been treated well by the New Fourth Army in every way. In addition to a comfortable material life, they also give us books to read (Chinese books and Japanese progressive novels), work (teaching soldiers Japanese slogans and making Japanese propaganda materials), and the right to enter and leave freely (referring to the meaning of going to the streets to play freely - reporter). Therefore, my spiritual life is also very pleasant. (Question) If the New Fourth Army were to release you back to your country at this moment, would you be willing? If you were willing, what would you plan to do when you returned to your country? (Answer) I am willing to return to my country. I will return to my country to join friends in promoting ideas inclined to socialism and anti-war, but this may not be possible. Because if the Japanese military knows that I have returned to my country, they will definitely kill me. (Question) What is the situation in Japan now? What is the relationship between the people and the government? (Answer) Generally speaking, the people in Japan have recently become increasingly poor due to rising prices, and they have a very bad impression of the government and have gradually begun to oppose it (mostly workers and laboring masses). (Question) What diseases do you see the most among Japanese soldiers in China? (Answer) Cholera, frostbite, and malaria are the most common. Cholera in summer, frostbite in winter, and malaria are common all year round. (Question) What do you think is the future and outcome of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) The Sino-Japanese War will be a protracted war, that is certain. According to my estimate, it will take about nine years. The outcome of the war is that China will be able to achieve final victory, that is also certain, because as the war is prolonged, Japan's difficulties in terms of manpower and material resources will increase, and at the same time, the anti-war forces among the people (including the Communist Party) will inevitably unite to overthrow the Japanese warlords. At that time, the Japanese central government, because it has no relationship with the Japanese people in peacetime, will inevitably fall. (Question) What do you plan to do after the end of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) After the end of the Sino-Japanese War, I want to return to Japan to discuss and promote the impressions and things I have learned here with my friends. (Question) How has your life been here for the past three months? (Answer) At first, I was not used to the food here, and I did not dare to eat some things because I was afraid there would be problems. Now I am not only used to it, but also I am very confident and satisfied. Therefore, I very much hope to help China defeat the Japanese warlords as a reward. (Question) Did anyone see you off when you left Japan? (Answer) Yes, the military mobilized the people to see me off. (Question) Do you miss your family now? (Answer) I missed them very much at first, but now it's better, because the New Fourth Army has helped me communicate with my family. (Question) Do you have a lover? (Answer) Yes, she is still studying in Tokyo. (Question) How is she now? Do you miss her? (Answer) I don't know now. She cried when she said goodbye to me. Of course, I miss her very much. I am now asking the New Fourth Army authorities to find a way to communicate with her. If I can find a way to bring her to China, that is what I hope for most.</p>
<p>Views of Foreign Correspondents on the Sino-Japanese War (Continued from the second page of the 12th)</p>
<p>It is indeed a杞憂[need clarification]; the dissatisfaction and anxiety of the world powers continue unabated, and Japan is no exception.</p>
<p>What are the views of Mr. Komori and Mr. Alaz?</p>
<p>Mr. Alaz, Swiss national and Economic Minister of the Chinese Daily, believes that the most fundamental first condition for the restoration of peace in the Orient is a ceasefire. When one side continues large-scale acts of war, no country can freely propose peace or overcome the underlying conditions for peace. Whether formal or not, it is a ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>No war continues forever, nor can it continue forever. All wars in history end with the conclusion of a peace treaty. The situation in the Far East is very clear. Japan has enormous interests on the mainland and should protect them, and the mainland countries should defend all their greater interests even more. Therefore, for the sake of lasting peace in the Far East, the terms of peace must take into account the rights and views of both countries, and must not be coercion by one side against the other. The people of a great country certainly cannot accept humiliating conditions from one side, as can be seen from the recent example of Germany. If the tip of a gun can support peace, that would be too wonderful.</p>
<p>Komori: Well then, let's end here. Thank you all.</p>

<h3>Victory in the Southern Shanxi Sweep Campaign: Our Army Repeatedly Captures Xia County and Wenxi, and the Siege of Anyi is Imminent</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, this newspaper, 17th Dispatch] Our army recaptured Xia County and Wenxi on the 14th, annihilating approximately one Japanese regiment. Currently, three routes are besieging Anyi, which is expected to fall imminently. The southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has entered a state of mixed warfare. The Japanese rear route has been cut off by us, and communication is lost.</p>
<p>[Minge Society and others, 17th Dispatch] The Japanese invaders in Yumen, since the 9th, have been using more than ten aircraft to cover their fierce attacks on us. Longmen was once captured by the Japanese, but after a fierce counterattack by our army, another unit attacked the Japanese from Xigukou, completely defeating the Japanese. The remnants fled back to Hejin. Currently, the Japanese have been cleared from Qiancun, Yudu Street, and the mountain passes north of Hejin. It is also reported that the Japanese who fled from Xipo have retreated to Yuncheng to reorganize.</p>
<p>[Minge Society and others, 17th Dispatch] The Japanese invaders in Xiangning Dong[area?] have been ambushed by our army along the way, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese, unable to vent their anger, massacred dozens of people when passing through Niuwang Temple. Currently, most of the Japanese invaders have fled to Linfen, and a unit has remained in Gucheng Town (more than ten miles northwest of Fencheng) and the Xishankou area of Fencheng Nongling. There are no Japanese traces.</p>
<p>[Minge Society and others, 17th Dispatch] The number of Japanese in Jiang County has increased to more than 4,000 in recent days, with more than 20 artillery pieces. One unit of more than 1,000, with six artillery pieces, fled south to Licun Village, where it is engaged in fierce fighting with one of our units. The Japanese have recently transported a large amount of ammunition from Hengshui to Hengling Pass.

<p>[Local News] The Taikoo ship Qiongzhou arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Haiphong via Beihai and Haikou, carrying many passengers and a large amount of goods from the mainland. The [reporter] interviewed the crew members of the ship and the passengers who came to Hong Kong from Beihai and Haikou, asking about the recent situation in the local area. The [reporter] recorded the conversations of the individuals. According to the crew members, Japanese warships were previously gathered off the coast of Beihai, with the intention of taking the opportunity to land, but our local defense was extremely strict, so the Japanese have not succeeded to date. The Japanese warships have already left the sea area there, but there are many Japanese ships arriving off the coast of Weizhou Island. When this ship passed through the area, it remotely saw about 20 large and small ships anchoring there, and many small motorboats were docked in the sea area. There was no harassment to ships coming and going from various countries. About half a day after this ship sailed from Haikou to Hong Kong, it saw five or six Japanese ships sailing south near the sea area south of Guangzhou Bay, followed by many small motorboats. The whereabouts were unknown, and their intention seemed to be to go to Qiongzhou or Weizhou off the coast of Haikou. When this ship approached the sea area opposite the outer Lingdingyang of the Pearl River, it also saw two Japanese ships sailing south from a distance. It was not known where the two ships were heading. It is said that in the past three to five days, many Japanese ships have also sailed south. According to passengers from Haikou, Japanese ships come and go without constant pattern outside Haikou Port, without unusual movements, but Japanese [aircraft?] often come to spy. On the morning of the 13th of this month, two Japanese planes flew in from the direction of Yuanzhou Island, and the Haikou air defense authorities issued an air raid alert. The residents fled in droves. Before long, two Japanese planes were seen flying over the city of Haikou, seemingly for reconnaissance, and then flew southwest. They returned three times, but did not drop bombs. Our air defense authorities did not fire on them because the aircraft were flying too high. The alert continued all day. After the Japanese planes left, the shops reopened. It was also learned that traffic between Hong Kong and Haikou is normal, and goods are also coming and going as usual.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Secret Agents Break into Concession to Kidnap, Forge Car Permits to Commit Crimes, A Famous Female Doctor Kidnapped</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tianjin News: Two plainclothes police officers from [the Japanese puppet regime] carrying guns drove a car with license plate number 709 to Dabeidao in the British Concession on the afternoon of the 13th. They broke into Jinzhongli No. 8, where senior staff of the Bank of China in Tianjin reside. There were British Concession police guards outside the gate. The police, upon discovering the intrusion, immediately opened fire and shot one of the [Japanese puppet regime] police officers on the spot. After being wounded, the [Japanese puppet regime] police officer fled in a hurry. After investigation, it was found that car number 709 was Cao Zhai's private car, and it had not left the premises. This proves that the license plate of the car used in the crime was forged by [the Japanese puppet regime]. The British Concession authorities, in addition to tightening security near Jinzhongli, are continuing their investigation. Furthermore, Ding Mao央, a famous female doctor in Tianjin, was kidnapped by [the Japanese] near the Public Women's Hospital outside the East Gate on the 12th. She is currently being held at the Japanese Concession police station, for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] The situation in the French Concession in Hankou has slightly improved.

Currently, the Japanese authorities have begun to deploy forces to force the Chinese to return to the city from the concession. It is reported that in the past two weeks, about a thousand people have been forced to leave the French Concession every day. However, foreign exporters in Hankou are not allowed to obtain export licenses, causing business to cease. However, the Japanese have begun to purchase large quantities of tung oil for transportation and export. Tung oil is one of Wuhan's important products.</p>
<h3>Northwest Situation and River Defense</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Bai Yun</p>
<p>1. The Time is Not Yet Ripe for the Japanese to Attack the Northwest</p>
<p>Since the loss of Guangzhou, the Sino-Japanese War has clearly entered a new phase. Those observing the war situation in the country have long believed that the Japanese would follow this by attacking the Northwest, aiming for Xi'an and Lanzhou, thus proposing the task of defending the Northwest. On the Japanese side, after occupying Wuhan, they also publicized their so-called Fourth Phase of Operations, which would involve attacking Lanzhou. Therefore, at that time, the whole country paid great attention to the development of the Northwest situation and expressed concern. At that time, news reported that the Japanese in southern Shanxi were increasing from time to time, that the Japanese at Fenglingdu were shelling Tongguan from time to time, that the Longhai Railway was experiencing some obstacles, and that Japanese planes were constantly bombing Xi'an, Ningxia, and some places in northern Shaanxi, seemingly indicating a westward advance. At the same time, there were various pieces of intelligence and rumors that confused people, such as "the Japanese have prepared ten divisions, led by Umezu, to attack Xi'an, and another eight divisions, with some regiments, led by Renuma, to attack Ningxia and approach Lanzhou." On the Suiyuan front, news of the Japanese advancing westward also came constantly, such as "the Japanese plan to transfer two divisions from Hankou to Suiyuan, requisitioning civilian housing in Guisui for their use." Such as "The Japanese plan to attack our western Erdos has gradually become active, it is reported that its First Route Army, divided into the following three routes forward: one from Jehol via Tongzhou to Ping綏 line west; two by Jehol Park to Dolun to Zhangjiakou; three gathering north Jin and Chahar border of the mixed army to Datong, rumor that action will be taken in the coming days." Such as "The commander of the Second Route Army for the Japanese invasion of the Northwest, Unnuma, is reportedly already in Zhangjiakou, transferring troops, and the Supreme Commander of the North China Army, Terauchi, is reportedly going to Datong and Baotou to command everything." Also, "The Japanese attempt to invade the Northwest is becoming increasingly active. The pro-Japanese puppet forces in Bailingmiao are arriving in Guyang at a rate of over six thousand per day, and the Japanese in Guisui have increased by over three thousand. The puppet army of two divisions in Baotou, commanded by the traitor Li, is the vanguard for the westward advance. Kuno and other units, with over eight hundred soldiers and over sixty vehicles, have moved westward. Over twenty Japanese planes are stationed at the Baotou Airport, and three hundred camels and dozens of vehicles are transporting supplies westward every day." These messages have caused anxiety for those with unclear understanding. At that time, the Japanese, after occupying Hankou, were targeting Xiangfan, dividing their forces to advance towards the Northwest, and thus some people believed that the Japanese would first occupy Xiangfan, advance along the Han River to Hanzhong, and at the same time occupy Wulin from Sui and Baotou, advance along the Yellow River to Ningxia, to reach Lanzhou, taking a large encirclement of Xi'an. It seemed that the entire Northwest had been placed under Japanese control, and was in imminent danger, causing people's hearts to become increasingly volatile. At this time, the reporter was in Xi'an, and visited all parties concerned, inquiring about the truth, and it was proved that these were messages lacking judgment and observations ignorant of the general situation. In order to understand the current situation of river defense, so as to make a comprehensive judgment and observation on the situation in the Northwest, the reporter then went to Chaoyi, Pingmin, and Tongguan to inspect, and has recently returned to Xi'an. The results of this trip further prove that most of the above messages and intelligence are the result of the Japanese spreading propaganda, and that the river defense is solid, and the Japanese would not dare to speak lightly of a westward invasion without sufficient preparation. A telegram from Hekou on December 30th stated, "Summarizing the situation of the past ten days, the Japanese in northern Shanxi and Suiyuan have not increased in number. The Japanese army currently stationed in Jin and Sui includes the 110th, 108th, 109th, and 116th divisions. Datong and Sui Baotou each have about a thousand Japanese troops, and Guyang and Wuchuan each have three to five hundred Japanese troops." This has negated the accuracy of the above news that the Japanese have begun or are about to attack Ninglan. The Japanese attacking Xiangfan have been hit head-on by our forces and have collapsed, which shows that the observation that the Japanese plan to invade Hanzhong is an exaggeration. Looking at the overall situation, it can be said that the time is not yet fully ripe for the Japanese to attack the Northwest. Our government has made careful plans for the national defense of the Northwest, and will never allow the Northwest to be easily shaken. The situation of the War of Resistance in the Northwest is still promising. In the future, the Northwest can be the starting point for recovering the lost territories of North China. At present, in this temporarily silent situation, it is precisely the time for us to actively prepare to resist the Japanese. All pessimistic and defeatist emotions must be swept away completely.</p>
<p>Recently, the international situation has repeatedly changed in our favor, and our policy and strength to resist to the end have become increasingly firm. Therefore, the new difficulties of the Japanese have increased, and their feet will sink deeper and deeper. Based on this new situation and the opinions gathered from all sides, the reporter has made a comprehensive account of the current situation and future of the War of Resistance in the Northwest.</p>
<p>2. Why the Japanese Are Not Immediately Attacking the Northwest</p>
<p>Attacking the Northwest is indeed one of the key points in the Japanese war plan against us. This is considered by the Japanese to be as important as attacking Wuhan and Guangzhou. However, after Wuhan was abandoned and Guangzhou was lost, the general public believed that the Japanese had already begun military operations to attack the Northwest, and the Japanese also repeatedly publicized this, so why has it not been realized? Why has the entire war situation fallen into a temporary state of silence? There are several reasons for this:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese originally fantasized that after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou, they would "pursue the victory" and eliminate our main force in one fell swoop, open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and then turn their troops north to attack the Northwest. Who knew that after two major battles around Xuzhou and Wuhan, lasting about ten months, they suffered heavy losses and were already exhausted. Therefore, they were struck by us in northern Hunan, and failed to gain a firm foothold in Guangzhou. At the same time, we increased fresh troops in Guangdong, adjusted our formations, and abandoned Wuhan in a planned manner, so the arrangements between Hunan and Hubei were completed in a timely manner, breaking the Japanese fantasy. According to the experience of the Civil War era, after the fall of Yuezhou, Changsha would not be easy to defend; however, this time we were able to prevent the Japanese from advancing south after the loss of Yuezhou. This shows that our military deployment has greatly improved compared to the situation after the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Xuzhou, which was beyond the Japanese expectations. It is said that if we had abandoned Wuhan a few days earlier, the arrangements between Hunan and Hubei could have been completed earlier, and the Japanese might not have been able to capture Yuezhou. This is not an exaggeration. At this point, the Japanese began to retreat in the face of difficulties, adopting a defensive posture in northern Guangdong and northern Hunan, and the battles on the main battlefield have temporarily become silent.</p>
<p>Second, the Japanese plan to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has failed, and they urgently need to rest. It is even more impossible to immediately carry out the arduous task of attacking the Northwest. At that time, the Japanese attacked Xiangfan mainly to ensure the security of Wuhan. Even if they occupied Xiangfan, they would not have the strength to continue to advance and attack Hanzhong; moreover, since Xiangfan had not been secured, the claim of a large encirclement of the Northwest was even more impossible. The Japanese north of the Yangtze River and south of the Pinghan Railway, of course, had to adopt a defensive posture at this time.</p>
<p>Third, the Japanese had already gone through fifteen months of invasion war, gaining more harm than good, and suffering greatly, while our policy of resisting to the end did not change due to the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, but became more determined. Full-scale guerrilla warfare, developing behind Japanese lines, is expanding day by day. The Japanese hope for our "surrender and peace" is impossible, and the dream of a quick victory has been shattered. Therefore, the Japanese had to temporarily stop their offensive and re-examine the project of invading us: Should they first clear the occupied areas, improve the puppet organizations, and alleviate their domestic crisis, and then slowly advance to destroy China? Or should they first strengthen their domestic warlord rule, continue to attack China, and even subjugate us, and then slowly digest it? Before these issues are decided, they must temporarily stop the attack.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Japanese can never change our policy of resisting to the end, but they still want to find loopholes in our camp to carry out their so-called "peace" political conspiracy. In order to facilitate this conspiracy, it is naturally necessary to temporarily stop the attack.</p>
<p>Fifth, at this time, a favorable shift in the international situation suddenly occurred. Britain and the United States helped us with huge loans, the Sino-American Silver Agreement was extended, and a rift occurred between the Soviet Union and Japan due to the Fisheries Agreement, which had a major impact on Japanese internal affairs and military affairs through diplomacy. The Japanese also had to transfer troops from North China to the Guandong to demonstrate to the Allies, so how could they have the strength to continue attacking the Northwest?</p>
<p>Since the entire war situation has temporarily fallen into silence due to the above-mentioned reasons, what meaning is there in continuing to attack the Northwest, other than putting on an act?</p>
<p>3. Has the Crisis in the Northwest Been Eliminated?</p>
<p>Since the Japanese national policy is based on the determination to destroy our country, the observation that they will attack the Northwest after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou is inherently true. Unless a revolution occurs in Japan, the economy and finances collapse, international sanctions are imposed, or we have the strength to counterattack, their national policy cannot be changed, and the crisis of the Japanese attacking the Northwest can never be eliminated due to the temporary silence of the war situation. This crisis may eventually be realized sooner or later, and of course, this crisis may also be reduced in the future, but the conditions for this elimination require us to strive for it through the arduous struggle to defend the Northwest. These conditions are not yet available at present, so the crisis in the Northwest still exists. Attacking the Northwest will probably still occupy a very important position in the Japanese future strategy.</p>
<p>The silence of the entire war situation is also beneficial to us, because we can take the opportunity to make more adequate preparations and shorten the time to achieve final victory. How long will this period of silence last? This will be determined by how the international and domestic environment of Japan and us change. It cannot be specifically pointed out now. For example, if British-American cooperation can become increasingly concrete, and if the Soviet Union can be tough on the fisheries issue with Japan to the end, then the pressure on Japan will be very great. This period of silence may be slightly prolonged, but we are not afraid of the Japanese launching an attack early, because in the future, the Japanese attack will lose the convenience of the railway lines and plains, and will go deep into our interior, which is more beneficial to us than to the Japanese. Therefore, whether the crisis in the Northwest is eliminated or not does not completely depend on whether the Japanese attack sooner or later, but on how we defend the Northwest.

<h3>New National Defense Frontline… Current Situation in Shashi</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Zeng</p>
<p>1. Jingzhou and Shashi After the Retreat from Wuhan</p>
<p>Jingzhou and Shashi are located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, are huge ports in the west, and are the rear screen of Wuhan, so the importance of the situation is self-evident. Commerce, culture, and other aspects are also quite prosperous. However, after the successive voluntary retreats from Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, the situation in Jingzhou and Shashi suddenly became tense. At that time, the reporter was transferred from Nanzhang to work in Jingzhou. After arriving in Shashi, what I heard and saw was a chaotic scene of soldiers and refugees. All that was on the street were either disorganized retreating soldiers from the front or wailing and begging refugees. The pawn stalls set up along the street were even more varied and countless. The walls were covered with small advertisements looking for people, such as "XX has gone to XX", "XX can come to XX"... Seeing such things would make people think of the tragic situation of wives and children being separated and fleeing in all directions!</p>
<p>At this time, Jingzhou and Shashi were in turmoil. If the Japanese had continued their westward advance after capturing Wuhan, then without a doubt, Jingzhou and Shashi could have been easily obtained. Look! The more well-established shops had either posted "This shop has moved to Yichang to do business" or "Temporarily closed," and all had closed their doors. Those who stayed here, however, raised prices and hoarded goods. Of course, those with money had already left, but the poor who could not escape suffered, and the streets and alleys were in a state of panic and chaos. How could they talk about "consolidating the defense"? In this situation, if it had lasted another half a month, then Jingzhou and Shashi would have become a "no man's land"!</p>
<p>After the fall of Wuhan, the line from Changsha, Hengyang, and Jingzhou and Shashi to Xiangfan became a national defense line, and Jingzhou and Shashi were the central hub on this line. However, the great fire in Changsha, the crazy bombing of Xiangfan, and Yichang behind Jingzhou and Shashi were also under air raids all day long. All of this was enough to increase the panic in Jingzhou and Shashi. This situation of "precariousness" gradually recovered after Mr. Liu Chaoliang (Commander of the Special Operations Brigade of the Military Affairs Commission) concurrently served as the Commander of the Jingzhou and Shashi Garrison.</p>
<p>2. The Activity of the Youth League</p>
<p>After taking office, Mr. Liu Chaoliang actively engaged in rectification work, on the one hand dispersing the population to prepare for necessary times, and on the other hand stabilizing people's hearts. These are two contradictory actions. However, the shrewd Commander Liu reconciled these two contradictions, so that the entire Shashi went from danger to stability, from stability to normalcy, and then developed and prospered.</p>
<p>The first step in building a new Shashi was to launch a "cleaning campaign", mobilizing all the forces in Shashi to clear the walls, ban street vendors, drive away stray dogs and pigs, and control slogans and posters. After a week, the entire Shashi was refreshed. In addition, the proper settlement of soldiers and refugees, and the order of the market were all restored, and only saw the new Shashi, where can you find the appearance of war again.</p>
<p>After cleaning up the city appearance. Training work began to take shape, dock workers, packing workers, rickshaw pullers, and people in the theater were all active under the leadership of the Youth War Zone Service Corps.</p>
<p>The Youth War Zone Service Corps of the Jingzhou and Shashi All-Circles Support Association was formed urgently during the crisis, gathering more than 40 young men and women from high schools and above. More than 20 comrades from the Special Operations Brigade's War Zone Service Team also participated and served as volunteer cadres. Liu Rongchao, director of the Garrison Command's Guiding Office, also served as the leader of the group. Their organization was divided into three teams according to age and gender in terms of living management, and divided into ten groups in terms of work, including editing, singing, comics, drama, condolence, rescue, and public transport. In addition to performing dramas, posting slogans and comics for publicity, they also carried out "localized" oral propaganda, such as talking about air defense when the air raid alarm was lifted; when a traitor was shot, they talked about eliminating traitors, which was shocking and easy to achieve great results. Since Shashi gradually turned from danger to stability, the Youth League launched practical organizational training work, which is now described separately:</p>
<p>Dock Workers' Union: A total of 32 docks in Shashi have a dock general trade union, and four branch unions are set up in different areas. One person is sent to each place to assist in handling labor affairs. At present, there are about 5,000 workers. The Youth League always puts the interests of the workers first, so it is highly trusted by the workers. Dock workers in Shashi have united into a steel-like whole!</p>
<p>Packing Workers' Union: There are thousands of workers in the packing factory. Although there was an organization before, it was actually in name only. After the Youth League sent people to reorganize it, it revived and prospered. At present, worker training is carried out every day, and female group members also go to train female workers. The work is very smooth, and the workers sincerely accept the training, and the group members do not avoid complicated explanations and tell them in detail. How can a loving mother's love be applied to the workers without achieving good results!</p>
<p>Drama Association: There are currently seven theaters in Shashi. Since the official establishment of the Drama Association, it has adhered to its position and worked hard. All obscene and corrupting social scripts have been absolutely stopped, and a performance is held every week to support the military, and all income is turned over to the support association for military use. This time, Shashi's gold donation and performance have been held many times, and the enthusiasm for saving the country and donating is a unique phenomenon in the Shashi theater industry.</p>
<p>Commercial Trade Association: People's relief power is the most abundant, but they are the least organized and lack the most training, so their power has always been difficult to exert. Now each store in Shashi has been organized into a trade association, totaling more than 40 types. In the future, they will exert the greatest power to seek happiness and improvement for the new Shashi and add new impetus to the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Union: The rickshaw pullers in Shashi are now organized, and they also have a general trade union and several branch unions. They will uphold the principle of "exerting their strength" and do their best to maintain transportation and indirectly help the war of resistance. We must know that the power of the laboring masses is the greatest and most sacred power!</p>
<p>(3) Gold Donation Movement in Shashi</p>
<p>The gold donation movement started on December 25 (Rejuvenation Day) of the 27th year and officially donated gold on New Year's Day this year. During the three-day process of gold donation, the Youth War Zone Service Corps made the greatest efforts. In addition to working hard to use the power of all trade unions and trade associations, they also held street fundraising, not afraid of the cold eyes of passers-by, not afraid of the disgust of misers, they were working enthusiastically, and their spirit and perseverance were shown from this work, and at the same time, they represented the true nature of revolutionary youth.</p>
<p>The gold donation platform in front of the Chamber of Commerce was crowded and noisy every moment for three days. Although alarms were frequent, they could not stop the enthusiastic outpouring of Shashi compatriots. Some were blind beggars with blurred eyes, some were children begging along the street; there were goddesses who sold smiles for a living, there were monks from ancient temples, soldiers who had retreated from the front line, and wounded soldiers recuperating in the hospital. Without rich or poor, without status, they all took out their money under the belief of one country! Dock workers, packing workers, rickshaw pullers, etc., are admirable and commendable, both contributing efforts and money, which is not comparable to the big-bellied merchants who generally regard money as their lives!</p>
<p>Now the gold donation has ended. The 110,000 yuan in gold donation has set a precedent for Shashi; this shows the enthusiasm and generosity of Shashi compatriots. The 150,000 citizens of Shashi will be a powerful auxiliary vehicle in the war of resistance camp. When the reporter was writing, I just got the news that Yichang's three-day gold donation totaled more than 17,000 yuan. I can't help but say, "So is Yichang"!</p>
<p>(4) Coda</p>
<p>Vigorous vitality has spread throughout Shashi, which is now becoming increasingly prosperous. If someone has been here before, they will be surprised to say, "I didn't expect it to be so stable." Yes, Shashi, which is so close to the front, is indeed unexpectedly stable and tense. In life, it does not have the slightest wartime state, but in work, it is full of vitality and progressive tension everywhere.</p>
<p>Look: Shashi is becoming active by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>(The picture is of a female worker who donated thirteen yuan)</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 16th] All sectors here hold great hopes for the current League of Nations meeting. Newspapers on the 16th all published editorials hoping for the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant, providing practical assistance to China and maintaining world peace. Zhu Jiahua and Wang Shijie hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the International Fellowship Society on the 16th, hoping that public opinion would promote the League of Nations to implement Article 16 and provide economic aid to China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] According to well-informed sources, Japan will soon reply to the British and American notes regarding the Open Door Policy. The reply will suggest that the relevant countries discuss and modify the principles of the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity. Although Japan knows that this approach will not be accepted by the powers, the authorities believe that Japan, due to its traditional friendly relations with Britain and America, may be able to negotiate under certain conditions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese Foreign Ministry is still studying the notes from Britain and the United States. According to well-informed sources, Japan will soon issue a reply, in which it will point out several basic diplomatic policies: (1) racial equality, (2) freedom of trade, and (3) fair distribution of resources.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] Due to Japan's interference with British interests in China, there are conflicting opinions among various departments of the British government regarding economic or commercial sanctions against Japan. Last Saturday and Sunday, Britain issued a strong note to Japan, mostly due to the firm attitude of the Foreign Office, which hoped that the United States would adopt the same policy and did not want to show weakness. Although the aforementioned note did not propose any retaliatory action, the Foreign Office very much wanted to strike a blow to Japanese trade and provide financial assistance to China. Conversely, the British Board of Trade and the Treasury advocate a cautious approach to Japan, as angering Japan could jeopardize Britain's £300 million investment in China and its valuable trade in the Far East. It is believed that the conflict on this point will be finally decided by Prime Minister Chamberlain, and some people believe that Chamberlain's attitude will largely be determined by President Roosevelt's words and deeds. At the same time, the British Board of Trade is still considering several methods, such as (1) providing loans to China so that it can purchase military supplies and other goods, (2) raising import taxes on Japanese goods entering Britain and British colonies, (3) prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to Japan, and (4) providing financial assistance to China. As a first step, the British government has agreed to provide China with a credit loan of £500,000 over four years to purchase British trucks to operate on the newly built Yunnan-Burma Road. However, the two countries are still arguing over the interest rate. Britain is demanding an annual interest rate of 6%, while China is only willing to offer 5.5%, saying that it is only offering this rate for similar loans from the United States. Britain also told China that once Parliament passes a new bill authorizing the establishment of a new credit loan of £10 million to protect British interests, China may be able to obtain a further £20 million in credit loans. Furthermore, there are some rumors about establishing a "Sino-British Stabilization Fund" to maintain the current state of Chinese legal tender. This matter is also related to Britain, because if China's legal tender system collapses, British commerce in China will inevitably suffer the same fate. As for commercial sanctions against Japan, all parties believe that the risks are far greater. However, it is heard that British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently told the Chinese side that if the United States can implement commercial sanctions, then Britain will definitely implement them without a doubt. On the day the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting opens, it is expected that Wellington Koo will take the opportunity to put pressure on Britain, asking it to provide greater assistance to China and impose sanctions on Japan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] According to the Financial Times, if the British note to Japan is regarded as a homily, its effect will be very great. However, is it imaginable that the Japanese authorities, who have reached this point today, will change their policies because of solemn teachings? The future of Britain's £300 million investment is threatened, and verbal protests alone cannot protect it. The current situation has developed to such a point that the British government cannot simultaneously allow Britain to avoid conflicts with the Far East and at the same time protect a small portion of the interests that have been destroyed. A united Anglo-American boycott of trade with Japan is more effective than sending a hundred notes to Japan, because Japan's foreign trade is its greatest weakness.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 17th] It is claimed here today that the French government has decided to follow the example of Britain and the United States and will submit a note to Japan requesting an explanation of its policies. It is heard that the content of the note will be the same as that issued by Britain the day before.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement saying that a copy of the British government's note to Japan regarding respect for the Washington Nine-Power Treaty was delivered to the State Department here today, but he refused to comment on it. When a reporter asked whether the British and American governments had exchanged opinions on this matter, Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that he was not aware of it personally.</p>
<h3>Preliminary German-Hungarian Negotiations; Hitler Receives Hungarian Foreign Minister; Anti-Comintern Pact to be Signed in Hungary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, received Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky this afternoon. This is the preliminary of Csáky's negotiations with German leaders on German-Hungarian issues. It is understood that Csáky will not sign the Anti-Comintern Pact in Berlin but will sign it after returning to the Hungarian capital. This morning, Csáky and Ribbentrop had a very harmonious two-hour conversation. Hungary may be somewhat disappointed with Germany's proposed Czechoslovak-Hungarian border. Ribbentrop expressed his condolences to Csáky. The two also discussed the issue of the German minority in Hungary and the economic problems of the Danube region. The Hungarian ambassador to Germany hosted a banquet for Csáky today, attended by ambassadors and many German ministers (including Minister of Economic Affairs Dr. Funk). German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will hold an "Anti-Comintern" banquet tonight, with Csáky as the guest of honor.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th] Although political circles are extremely tight-lipped about the events discussed when the German leader met with the Hungarian Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon, it is generally speculated that the following four items must have been discussed: (1) Hungary's withdrawal from the League of Nations; (2) the German efforts to persuade both sides to comply with the Vienna Arbitration Tribunal's decision regarding the frequent border conflicts between Hungary and Czechoslovakia; (3) the issue of the German association organized by the 600,000 Germans residing in Hungary; and (4) Hungary's relationship with its neighboring countries Romania and Yugoslavia, with Germany attempting to forge closer friendships with Hungary and Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>US Silver Purchases; Congressional Movement to Ban Foreign Silver</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] According to Washington, there is an important movement in Congress to prohibit the Treasury Department from purchasing foreign silver. Many people from silver groups are also strongly supporting the movement, fearing that large-scale purchases of foreign silver will cause the domestic silver market price to fall into extreme stagnation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] According to reports, the US government is currently under some pressure to stop purchasing foreign silver. People in the London silver market expressed surprise at this statement but were not overly alarmed. According to well-informed sources, it is naturally accepted that the US government cannot purchase silver permanently. Under the current circumstances, stopping purchases can only cause silver prices to plummet. Moreover, the US government already has a large amount of silver. Washington will still not adopt this policy, as the result will affect itself no less than anyone else. Furthermore, due to the inflow of huge amounts of gold, the US government wants to purchase gold and silver in accordance with the ratio stipulated in the "Currency Act" (i.e., 75% gold and 25% silver), it must continue to purchase large quantities of silver.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that he does not support taxing agricultural products. He believes that taxes on consumers are already high enough. He also said that he has not yet discussed with the Senate the issue of stopping the purchase of foreign silver.</p>
<h3>Dominican Republic Agrees to Accommodate 100,000 Jews</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The Dominican Republic, in cooperation with the International Refugee Committee, has pledged to accommodate approximately 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe. The proposal for this matter was submitted to the government by Frederick Scholes, the country's consul general in London. The content of the plan is roughly to organize the refugees so that they can become good citizens in the future, contributing to the country, and not advocating the wholesale reception of the refugees as they are.</p>
<h3>British Chief of the General Staff to Inspect the Middle East</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] British Chief of the General Staff Viscount Gort is scheduled to depart for the Middle East on the 26th of this month for an inspection, with his departure from London lasting several weeks.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Delegates Conduct Political Talks; British and French Foreign Ministers Meet with Soviet Ambassador; Spanish Issue Openly Discussed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 16th] The 104th regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held this afternoon. Delegates from various countries conducted important political talks outside the meeting. French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz in the morning and conducted talks with Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak in the afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Halifax also had discussions with Ambassador Suritz in the afternoon. French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to return to Paris tonight to attend the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow and participate in a foreign policy debate. Foreign Secretary Halifax will also return home in the same car, and the two will meet again in the car.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 16th] Before the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, the report drafted by the British, French, and Soviet Four-Nation Committee on the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain was first released. It stated that there are 12,673 foreign combatants in Barcelona and the central region. Those who participated in the front lines have now withdrawn, totaling 6,490 people. The committee report recommends that the withdrawal plan be extended to four months in order to complete its mission. Regarding the withdrawal procedures, the report stated that all combatants who are forced to leave the country for political reasons must be sent back to their countries. However, those who are expected to be mistreated after returning to their countries will be sent to other countries where they can be safe. French representative Foreign Minister Bonnet said in a speech that the committee will report to the General Assembly within a few weeks that all foreign volunteers on the government army side have been withdrawn, so the rebel side should also withdraw foreign volunteers in the same way, so that Europe will not be at risk of national conflict. British representative Foreign Secretary Halifax also supported the committee's recommendations. He reiterated the British government's belief that foreign intervention in Spain must stop. Soviet representative Mr. Suritz said that the committee's report can eliminate all doubts about the nature of the government army's organization.</p>
<h3>Britain to Purchase Large Quantities of Zinc for Building Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] According to the opinions of the hardware industry here, the recent increase in the need for zinc is related to the government's plan to build air raid shelters. Although there is no official report on the quantity and price of zinc, it is believed that the British government has ordered approximately 100,000 to 120,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battles in Barcelona; Women Parading Amidst the Sound of Aircraft; Resolve to Fight to the Death and Defend Catalonia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Barcelona, 16th] Today, rebel planes soared over Barcelona. Amidst the sound of aircraft, hundreds of women paraded fearlessly on the streets where refugees gathered, calling on the public to resolve to fight to the death. They held flags with slogans such as "Strengthen Catalonia" and "Defend Catalonia to the Death." Five rebel bombers dropped twenty heavy bombs on the port area, about half of which landed in the sea. Four hit workers' residential areas, injuring five people. Government fighters rose up to fight them, and the battle was fierce. The rebel planes were soon driven away. At the same time, the government army bypassed from the rear of Tarragona and recovered its original positions on the mountain, controlling the main road east of Vendrell (15 miles from the coast).</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] The Spanish Embassy in London issued a statement today saying, "If anyone today again speculates that the war in Spain is about to stop, they will be misled. The recent advance of the enemy has not reduced the effectiveness or combat power of the government army. The Spanish government solemnly declares that although foreign infantry, well-armed, interferes arbitrarily, and various dictatorial countries try to undermine it, our Spanish people will bravely resist until the ultimate goal of the foreign invaders and their Spanish companions ends in failure."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 16th] Franco's army recently broadcast to the people of Catalonia, saying that the rebels will inevitably win, and everyone should lay down their weapons, and said, "Our march into Catalonia is not to destroy it, but to save it."</p>
<h3>US Navy Department Continues to Draft Plans; Firmly Insists on Fortifying Guam; To Prevent Japan from Advancing South and West</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Roosevelt consulted with his key diplomatic, naval, and army subordinates, and the topic was clearly related to national defense and foreign policy. Those who consulted with Roosevelt included Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Secretaries Woodring, Edison, Naval Captain Laws, and Ambassador Bullitt. Afterwards, Roosevelt consulted with Interior Secretary Ickes, Agriculture Secretary Wallace, and Labor Secretary Perkins. It is said that this conversation included the "Commodity Credit Corporation."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The US Navy Department is currently continuing to draft military expansion plans. Fortifying Guam as an advanced base for the Far East Fleet is one of the ends of this plan. However, government officials and Congress do not agree. Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, opposes fortifying Guam, while a Navy Department spokesperson said, "The Navy has always advocated making Guam a strong advanced fleet base to assist coastal defense and to provide our fleet with a base when operating in the Far East. We will abandon the Philippines in 1946, so we must have a suitable base in the Far East, otherwise we will become a second-rate power in the Pacific. Since Guam is our territory and there is no reason to abandon it, why not fortify it?" According to some well-informed sources, the State Department is the most opposed to fortifying Guam. Guam has long been a demilitarized area. Admiral Hepburn also mentioned the status of Guam in his report released last week. According to the report, the island is 1,500 miles from Japan. If there is a submarine base there, it will be enough to prevent Japan from advancing south and west. However, due to Japan's opposition, how this matter should be handled must be determined by basic national policy. Hepburn's report said that building a submarine base on Guam would, first, protect the Philippines from the threat of a major war, second, make US coastal defense and defense in Hawaii extremely simple, and third, give the US fleet greater freedom of movement to cope with possible unexpected events in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Gospel for Children</h3>
<p>The fate of Chinese children has long been squeezed into the most unfortunate quagmire in the world. Widespread poverty prevents a surprisingly large number of children from receiving proper education, and the "blessing of education" received by a small number of so-called "lucky ones" is nothing more than sitting in a "children's prison," not to mention at home, but also at school. Therefore, the cry of "Save the children" has long been noticed by every person who cares about the education of our "next generation."</p>
<p>The sound of the all-out war of resistance broke the obstacles to national political progress. The education of the "next generation" was placed at the forefront of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and "breaking the children's prison" became a major task in saving the children. According to a special dispatch from our Chongqing on the 17th, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to elementary schools across the country strictly prohibiting corporal punishment. This may be the first step in breaking the children's prison and improving school education, and it can also be regarded as the first sound of liberation for children in the War of Resistance. We not only hope that teachers in elementary schools across the country will abide by this order and transform children's prisons into children's paradises, but we also hope that advanced members of society will assist the government in paying attention to the vast majority of children who are excluded from the doors of schools and who are displaced under the bombs of the invaders!</p>
<h3>The War Situation in North China is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army's five-pronged attack on Shanxi was defeated by us in the New Year of this year, they are now actively preparing for a larger-scale military invasion of the Northwest. A large number of Japanese troops are concentrating in Shanxi and Henan. In order to thwart the new offensive of the Japanese invaders, we have, on the one hand, completed the entire military deployment in the four northern provinces, and on the other hand, under the leadership of a certain route army, launched a large-scale battle to attack Rehe. There have been fierce battles in Malang Valley, and the Northeast Volunteer Army is also actively operating. The war situation in North China will become increasingly serious, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the war situation in North China will inevitably contain a large number of Japanese troops. At least the fifteen divisions now in North China and the more than 300,000 Japanese troops in the Northeast will not be able to be transferred to other war zones, which will be of great help to the war of resistance in Central and South China. It is not difficult to imagine. It should be particularly pointed out here that our army in Central and South China has now reached the time to step up the implementation of a counter-offensive. Even in order to stop the new offensive of the Japanese army, we should not miss the opportunity to "seize the initiative." In order to achieve victory, every compatriot should more enthusiastically support and assist this counter-offensive.</p>
<h3>Review of American Far East Diplomacy, Translated by Zino from the December Issue of "Amerasia" Magazine Last Year</h3>
<p>Two articles, "The First Anniversary of the Far Eastern War" by Professor P.H. Clyde of Columbia University, a leading authority on Far Eastern affairs, and "A Review of America's Loan Plans to China" by Jaffray, the editor of "Amerasia" magazine, were both published in "Amerasia". Professor Clyde raises three points for discussion: (1) America's interests in the Far East have been utterly ruined; (2) America's true will has been desecrated by Japan's war actions; and (3) Japan is visibly much weaker. Professor Clyde points out that because of these three points, the United States needs to re-evaluate its Far Eastern diplomatic policy. He then proposes four concrete solutions, which are summarized as follows: (1) Relief for innocent Chinese civilians; (2) Voluntary individual boycott of Japanese goods; (3) Stopping the sale of military supplies to Japan; (4) Striving for informal, credit-based (loan) practical assistance to China. Professor Clyde, with his keen insight, has formulated these proposals so as not to stir up the current psychological fear in America. There is nothing to say except unanimous approval for his suggestions. If Americans are to implement even this minimal step of relief, a psychological shift is also required. Currently, America is filled with a mad and paralyzing pacifism that endangers diplomatic actions and influences diplomatic thought.</p>
<p>The fundamental condition of a peaceful policy is based on the principles of law and their implementation, and on words that can be debated with the other party. Recently, the people of the United States have not fully understood these two conditions. It must be understood that the principles of law and their implementation are the guiding principles for a country's international relations. However, if a country only adopts these laws for itself and applies these laws as moral precepts for maintaining its foreign interests, then the entire system of peace based on these laws will be damaged in part. If a country disregards the rules of international conduct, regardless of the rights and obligations of international life; and other countries ignore such a chaotic international political situation because these rules cannot be implemented, then world peace can never be maintained.</p>
<p>These two basic conditions are not only despised by the United States, but at the same time, most people even deny their existence. The reason why this situation has evolved to this point is due to the fact that diplomatic relations have become a common matter in recent years. Unwillingness to go to war with an aggressor is one thing; inability to act based on reasonable or affirmative evidence is another. All human experience proves that defense for one's own benefit is paramount, thus enabling people and the environment to balance, and this golden rule exists indelibly. And now, the situation in the United States seemingly makes the government afraid of causing war, so it remains silent about any international rogue. The phrase "timid as a mouse" is the best portrayal of this fact. However, I don't believe that the American people are timid as mice, they are just at a loss.</p>
<p>What is most perplexing is the lack of action in dealing with international affairs. I believe that telling a country about the destruction or contempt for your interests is not a declaration of war. It is not an illegal action to ask a government to stop another country from harming the interests of its country and its people. There are so many ways to resolve international disputes, and the so-called active policy towards Japan will cause war is nothing more than a fantasy in a mirror.</p>
<p>Regarding this, we cannot but pay attention to our Far Eastern diplomatic policy. At the beginning of the "China Incident," the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan's concept of international law is a feasible rule derived from national action, so Japan demands to handle it on its own, and other countries have no room to interfere, and military actions are becoming more and more fierce. After the end of the war, if there is no social and economic revolution, Japan's position will be built on international law made in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should pay attention to the international law promoted and implemented by other countries in the Far East. The most interesting is Japan's concept of conquest. In Manchuria, there is a puppet state. On the surface, there is an independent government. In fact, it is completely under Japanese rule. This plan is an attempt to escape the condemnation of international law. Stating that it does not intend to invade other countries. However, the law-abiding world, the League of Nations and the United States created a principle of non-recognition in response. Therefore, among the countries of the world, only Germany, Italy, Poland and El Salvador maintain diplomatic relations with the pseudo-"Manchukuo." As a result, pseudo-"Manchukuo" has cut off all international relations, its currency is like waste paper outside the country, and it has no economic status in the world, thus Japan has increased many difficulties. Japan's political relations in the world are also difficult. Japan is not allowed to enter the financial markets of various countries. Japan's commercial treaty relations are also frozen, because Japan refuses to negotiate without a special treaty with "Manchukuo." Therefore, all countries do not endorse what Japan has done and do not agree with it.</p>
<p>In China proper, Japan has not come up with new political tricks. Japan is only setting up many puppet regimes and using the names of these pseudo-organizations to exploit China's resources. It is very clear that all the facilities of "Manchukuo" may be the first step for Japan to protect the interests of China proper, and these interests are closely related to all countries.</p>
<p>Japan's second frustrating problem is the "war" issue. It wants to avoid the US president implementing the Neutrality Act, and to prevent other countries from condemning it, so it says that this dispatch of troops to China is not intended for conquest, but only to force China to cooperate. Therefore, this dispute is not a formal war. In fact, this is a counterproductive trick. Since it is not a war, Japan cannot enjoy the rights of a belligerent. Therefore, it cannot implement the laws of war under international law. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Lam Pak-sang, the Person Responsible for the "South China Daily" Who Signed and Published Wang Jingwei's Telegram Advocating Peace, Was Suddenly Attacked Yesterday: Two Youths Attacked with Iron Cones in Front of the Lane Crawford Building, Suffering Serious Injuries to the Head and Neck. One Suspect Was Arrested</h3>
<p>At 5:15 PM yesterday, in front of the Lane Crawford Company on Des Voeux Road Central, a young man in a suit was suddenly attacked by two workers dressed as laborers, who used iron bars and iron cones to inflict serious injuries, leaving him unconscious. Afterwards, one person was arrested and identified as one of the attackers. The reporter immediately went to the scene of the incident to investigate. Later, it was learned that the young man in the suit was Lam Pak-sang, the person responsible for the Hong Kong South China Daily. On that day, Mr. Lam was walking to the front of the Lane Crawford Company when he encountered two laborers dressed as workers, who walked up to him. One of them first used an iron bar to strike Lam's neck with force. The other then used an iron cone to forcefully strike his head and neck, causing blood to gush out. The two workers continued to strike him, and his body and arms were injured by the iron bars and iron cones. Lam, having suffered these blows, fell unconscious to the ground. Seeing that Lam was injured, the two assailants immediately left. At that time, a Westerner nearby saw this scene and immediately helped the injured party while blowing a whistle. A British soldier happened to be passing by and arrested a passerby, who was identified as one of the attackers. The police then telegraphed the Central Police Station to report the case and telegraphed for an ambulance to take Lam to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, the injured person gradually regained consciousness after examination by the doctor. His injuries are not expected to be serious. It is learned that Lam Pak-sang is 37 years old and studied in Paris, France. At that time, Wang Jingwei happened to be in Paris. Lam convened a meeting of students studying in France in Paris to welcome Wang. This was the initial stage of the relationship between the two. Wang thought that Lam was very talented in writing, so he recruited him. When Wang established the South China Daily in Hong Kong, he appointed Lam to be in charge. When Wang later established the China Daily in Shanghai, Lam was again transferred to be in charge. Lam was very active in political circles because of his relationship with Wang Jingwei. Recently, he was also appointed as a member of the Legislative Yuan. Last month, Lam Pak-sang and Mei Si-ping jointly signed and sent Wang Jingwei's telegram advocating peace to famous newspapers in Hong Kong and China. The central government, because of Lam Pak-sang's actions, issued an order to strip him of his position as a member of the Legislative Yuan. Lam Pak-sang and Mei Si-ping had recently jointly issued a letter from Wang Jingwei to Chiang Kai-shek. The wording was very absurd. From this, it can be seen that Lam Pak-sang has a very deep understanding of Wang Jingwei himself. According to the reporter's investigation, Lam Pak-sang had made an appointment with several friends at 4:00 PM yesterday to go to the Lane Crawford Company's restaurant for afternoon tea. After tea at 5:00 PM, they dispersed. He also wanted to turn to Des Voeux Road Central, but he was attacked by the assailant at the side alley of the White House. The Hong Kong police detectives are taking this matter very seriously, because this matter is greatly related to the political aspect and the recent telegram from Wang Jingwei advocating peace. It is also learned that one of the arrested persons, named Chen Lin, 27 years old, claims to be a painter. He absolutely denied the sniping of Lam, but the police authorities, for the sake of prudence, are still detaining the person pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Order in Various Refugee Camps Is Good: Refugees Engage in Farming and Handicrafts. Education of Refugee Children Has Also Been Implemented Step by Step. The Hong Kong Government Is Preparing to Relieve Poor People Sleeping in the Open</h3>
<p>In order to accommodate poor refugees, the Hong Kong government has built refugee camps in Kam Tin, Fanling, Ma Tau Chung, King's Park, and North Point. The total number of refugees accommodated in each camp is about 10,000. The management of each refugee camp is very strict and perfect. In addition to being well-fed and clothed, the refugees in the camps have started to learn small handicrafts or engage in farming. After a certain period of time, the refugees will be able to reach self-sufficiency. The government's establishment of refugee camps is not only to settle poor refugees, but also to solve the problem of homeless people in Hong Kong. Father Ryan, the secretary of the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, met with reporters yesterday morning and gave a detailed report on the current situation and management of the refugee camps in various districts of Hong Kong, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Refugees in Kam Tin Engage in Farming</p>
<p>The Kam Tin refugee camp can originally accommodate 5,000 people, but some have already left the camp and returned to their hometowns. Currently, there are only 3,300 refugees in the camp. Two weeks ago, the camp had already started agriculture, with refugees responsible for farming. Every 50 people are in a team, and each team works for one week, six hours a day, in shifts. Refugees cultivate a total of nine acres of land. The land and seeds were borrowed by Deng Boqiu and other gentry in the New Territories. In addition to farming, refugees in Kam Tin also learn small handicrafts, such as making glass bottles and straw bags. Currently, 1,000 straw bags can be produced every day, and this number will increase in the future. A woodworking factory will also be established so that refugees can learn another skill. In the future, the selling price of the products will be distributed to the working refugees. It is expected that after the industrial development of the refugee camps in the future, the refugees will be able to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Schools for Refugee Children Established in Fanling</p>
<p>There are three refugee camps in Fanling: one in the north of Fanling, one in the south of Fanling, and the other in Cha Kwo Ling. The three camps accommodate a total of 1,500 refugees. Due to local environmental conditions, no handicrafts have been organized, nor has land been found for refugees to cultivate. There are a total of 200 refugee children in the Fanling refugee camp. In order to prevent refugee children from becoming accustomed to laziness, the refugee camp management authorities have established two schools for refugee children, so that refugee children can read and write, and will not become illiterate when they grow up. The two schools have achieved good results and may be expanded in the future. At the same time, the issue of refugees producing their own goods is also being considered. Once a good method is found, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Order in Various Camps in the City Is Good</p>
<p>The number of refugees accommodated in the various refugee camps in the city is about 4,000. The King's Park camp accommodates 1,607 people, North Point 1,471 people, and the Ma Tau Chung camp originally accommodated 1,008 people, but because a part of it was allocated to accommodate Chinese troops returning from British territory, it currently only accommodates 817 refugees. There are refugee children's schools in the North Point refugee camp with a total of four classes and 200 students. The number of students can be expanded to 500 in the future. The handicrafts learned by the refugees in North Point are sewing and weaving rattan ware. Women also take on cooking work. The refugees in the King's Park camp are also engaged in small handicrafts. There are 60 women in the camp engaged in sewing and embroidery. The Ma Tau Chung camp plans to establish a soap manufacturing factory, which will be realized in a short period of time. The refugees in each camp are working hard and will have a huge output in the future. The selling price of the products is received by the refugees themselves, so the refugees are happy to work and hope to achieve self-sufficiency. The order in each camp is very good.</p>
<p>The Government Pays Attention to Relieving the Poor</p>
<p>Mr. Lai continued that the main purpose of the Hong Kong government's construction of refugee camps is to accommodate refugees coming to Hong Kong from the war zone, but the current camps have not been filled, and there are currently no refugees coming to Hong Kong. It is expected that there will not be a large number of refugees coming to Hong Kong in the future. The government authorities plan to use refugee camps to accommodate poor people sleeping on the streets in Hong Kong. They have just started to investigate the number of people sleeping on the streets and are preparing to transfer the homeless to refugee camps. This plan of the government is actually killing two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it provides a home for the poor sleeping on the streets, and on the other hand, it can improve the appearance of the city, which is the best way. Moreover, there are industries in the refugee camps, and the poor can learn skills after entering the camps, and may reach a self-sufficient stage in the future, which is better than wandering on the streets. This plan of the government will be realized in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>The Federation of All Circles Will Supplement the Collection of Membership Fees. A Resolution Was Passed Yesterday to Send Letters to Various Members Seeking Opinions</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Federation of All Circles held its 32nd joint meeting at Tung Wah Hospital yesterday. Dozens of representatives from various groups attended. The chairman, Liu Qingxuan of the General Affairs Group, after passing the minutes of the previous meeting, first reported the work of each group separately, and then continued to discuss the proposals of each group. As a result, it was resolved: (1) To retroactively approve the appropriation of National Currency 2,000 yuan by the Standing Committee to relieve refugees in Boluo County. (2) The requests for assistance from the 5th Detachment of the 1st District and the guerrillas in the Dongbao-Hui border area are not to be discussed because the government has an overall plan for the guerrillas. (3) To reply in writing to the letter from the Panyu Association inquiring about the original text of the resolution of the 30th meeting, which appropriated 5,000 yuan to relieve refugees in northern Yu. (4) To ask the nursing groups among the members to submit written reports on their organization and work for reference when sending teams back to China. (5) In the future, proposals from various members should be submitted in writing to the Standing Committee for review and then submitted to the General Assembly.

<h3>The China Art Troupe Performed for the First Time Yesterday: "Song of Righteousness" Resounded Through the Clouds</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the China Art Troupe has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life with its large number of talents and great plans. As the theater movement in Hong Kong is becoming more and more popular this year, the China Art Troupe held its first performance at the Central Theatre. People from all walks of life were eager to see it first. Starting at noon, the Central Theatre was crowded with men and women. The program on that day was "Song of Righteousness," which described the political awakening of the guerrilla team in the mainland and the process of cooperation between the army and the people. The plot was extremely moving, especially the realistic performances of "Captain Liu Guan" Yuan Rikui and "Big Red Shoes" Yao Ersao, which aroused the admiration of the audience. At the end, the "Song of Righteousness" resounded through the clouds, and the crowd left the venue with a renewed spirit. The evening show, "Getting Carried Away," was a work specially directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, hired by the troupe. The plot was elegant and popular, and the purpose of the play was pure. By afternoon, the tickets were sold out, and many spectators were turned away. Li Hua, the director of the troupe's front desk, repeatedly expressed his regret to the latecomers and hoped that they would come early today.</p>
<h3>×Armed Tugboat Robbed a Cargo Ship in the Waters of Mas Bay. The Ship Met a British Warship on the Way and Escaped</h3>
<p>The hijacking of Hong Kong fishing boats and cargo ships by armed tugboats has been happening recently. Although the Hong Kong naval authorities have repeatedly issued serious warnings, the rampant actions of the ×people at sea remain the same. According to the "South China Morning Post" yesterday morning, at 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month, in the eastern waters of Mas Bay in the Chinese Sea, a cargo ship No. 565 registered in Hong Kong suddenly encountered a ×armed tugboat. Seeing the cargo ship passing by from afar, the tugboat chased closely, firing three volleys of shots along the way. The shots were as dense as a string of beads and were very fierce. The bullets hit the side of the ship, as dense as a honeycomb. Seeing that the situation was not good, the shipowner Li Shan ordered all the crew members on board to lie down in the cabin to avoid being shot, allowing the cargo ship to drift in the sea. Before long, the ×tugboat had caught up, lowered a small boat carrying five ×soldiers, and approached the cargo ship. They swarmed aboard, pointed guns at everyone on the ship, searched the ship, and then snatched the ship's license plate. Then, they forced the shipowner and crew to get on the ×small boat, and then hijacked the cargo ship. Not long after the ×ship sailed away, the British warship HMS Danae happened to pass by and rescued Li and others. They asked about the situation, and Li told them everything. The captain immediately telegraphed back to Hong Kong to report the hijacking of the cargo ship and tracked it forward. In an instant, they caught up. Seeing that the situation was not good, the ×ship reluctantly released the captured cargo ship. The British warship did not go too far and towed the cargo ship back, thus avoiding being hijacked. Fortunately, there was no other major loss besides the ship's license plate.</p>
<h3>Good Times Don't Last Long: Last Year, the Total Trade Volume of Hong Kong Broke the Record of Previous Years. The Whole Year Increased by More Than 40 Million Compared with the Previous Year. After ×Invaded Southern China, It Has Been Sharply Reduced Compared with Before</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, before Southern China was invaded, Hong Kong, with its special status, had an exceptionally prosperous trade in various aspects. The monthly trade reports of the Statistics Department broke all previous records. However, since the outbreak of the war in Southern China, it has been declining day by day. However, the annual statistics, due to the good harvest in the first half of the year, can also create a new record of import and export trade in previous years. According to the report of the Statistics Bureau, the trade figures for December last year decreased by 15,291,508 yuan compared with the same month in 1937. However, the annual statistics reached 113,071,214 yuan, which is 44,568,526 yuan more than the previous year.</p>
<p>The Annual Statistics Exceeded the Previous Year</p>
<p>The total import trade for the year was 61,816,8937 yuan, which is 1,100,4970 yuan more than the previous year. The total export trade was 51,119,2277 yuan, which is 44,579,556 yuan more than the previous year. However, this import and export statistics does not include goods transshipped through Hong Kong to other places, items carried by tourists, and the value of equipment and treasures used by the military.</p>
<p>It Began to Dim After Guangzhou Fell</p>
<p>Since ×invaded Southern China, Hong Kong's foreign trade has become dim, especially in December. The import trade in that month was only 46,496,841 yuan, while the same month in the previous year was 49,342,058 yuan. The export trade was only 33,535,169 yuan.</p>
<p>Trade with China Broke Records</p>
<p>Last year, the total trade with China reached 463,991,816 yuan, an increase of 62,269,645 yuan compared with the previous year. Among them, the import trade was 233,264,347 yuan, and the previous year's figure was 211,321,185 yuan. The export trade was 230,727,469 yuan, an increase of 40,326,483 yuan compared with the previous year's figure.</p>
<p>Trade in Southern China Has Been Reduced by More Than Half</p>
<p>It dropped sharply to a low level in December. The value of imports from China was only 4,649,061 yuan, while the same month in the previous year was 15,761,968 yuan. Imports to China also fell to 7,717,927 yuan. Among them, trade with Southern China was the most significant. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the value of imports from various ports in Southern China such as Haikou, Jiangmen, Wuzhou, Ganzhou, and Yunnan was only 5,308,836 yuan, while the previous year was 12,411,036 yuan. The value of exports to the above-mentioned places was only 3,500,888 yuan, while the previous year was 14,409,998 yuan. The annual statistics of trade with Southern China increased by 6,045,979 yuan compared with the previous year. The total value of export trade was 139,643,818 yuan, and the total value of import trade was 105,569,145 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports of Gold and Silver Surpassed Imports</p>
<p>Last year, the total value of gold and silver exported from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom and the United States was 18,810,3656 yuan, while the value of imports from China was 9,600,1218 yuan. From January of the previous year to the present, the total value of gold and silver bars and treasures exported from Hong Kong was 583,350,180 yuan, while the total value of imports was 396,050,173 yuan. Among the above-mentioned imports and exports of treasures, gold and silver bars were mostly exported by the Chinese government to the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Is the Center for Tea Exports</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that Hong Kong was the center for tea exports last year, it was mentioned in this newspaper a few days ago. The following figures will illustrate it. Last year, the value of tea imported into Hong Kong was 16,926,951 yuan, and in 1937, it was 3,620,211 yuan. Last year, the largest amount of tea exported from Hong Kong was shipped to Vladivostok, a total of 16,772,110 pounds worth 9 million yuan. Egypt was also a good customer, but what they bought was cheap tea, the quantity was 2 million pounds worth 162,000 yuan. In the past, this trade was entirely purchased directly from domestic suppliers by land, but due to the war, it was changed to sea transport. However, since the outbreak of the war in Southern China, the land and water transportation between here and Guangzhou has been cut off, and this superior market will not be able to continue to be maintained this year.</p>
<h3>The Manufacturers Association Will Continue to Hold the Chinese Goods Exhibition This Spring. The Scale of This Exhibition in Mid-February Will Be Larger Than Last Year</h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association established the Chinese Goods Exhibition at St. Paul's College last year, people from all walks of life were able to have a better understanding of the products of the manufacturers here, and the prospects for domestic products benefited greatly. The association recently believes that it is necessary to continue to hold the National Exhibition in Hong Kong this year, as the population has increased sharply. It specially convened a special meeting of the board of directors at 12:00 yesterday to consider and study the exhibition date and all the methods for a long time. Decisions have been made on the exhibition date and all the methods. The exhibition period is scheduled for four consecutive days from February 19. After all the articles of association and personnel methods have been revised, they will be officially announced within days. It is heard that the directors of the association are very concerned about this year's exhibition. Although last year's exhibition has been well received by all parties, in order to make it even better and more perfect, they are very active in the operation of the exhibition. It is found that this year's site is larger than last year's, and the organizers have the experience of last year to participate in the government, so the future achievements will be more advanced than before.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Steamer Returns to Hong Kong from Guangzhou Yesterday: Resumption of Guangdong-Hong Kong Navigation Not Yet Easy; Carrying Fifty-Seven Passengers, Absolutely No Cargo; Navigation Conditions Not Finalized, Today Changing Course to Hong Kong-Macau</h3>
<p>The Jinshan vessel of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company, which departed from Hong Kong for Guangzhou on the 11th of this month, staying in the province for a week, returned to Hong Kong yesterday morning at 8:15 am, arriving at 3:15 pm, and docked at the Triangular Pier.</p>
<p>Fifty-Seven Passengers Returned to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Upon investigation, there were fifty-seven passengers returning to Hong Kong on the steamer yesterday. Among them, forty were foreigners, including British and American merchants, as well as some reporters from × side and secret agents. There were fourteen Chinese passengers, including women and children, who were working in Shamian. They all traveled in the first-class dining room and dining hall seats. There were also two Chinese who seemed to be specially dispatched by × side to Hong Kong, seated in certain first-class cabins, acting suspiciously. After the ship docked, they immediately disembarked. The steamer did not carry any cargo on this return trip, but the furniture and household items filled almost the entire ship's hold, all purchased cheaply in Guangzhou by foreigners and transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Conditions Not Finalized, Changing Course to Macau</p>
<p>Whether the Jinshan steamer would continue to sail to the province after returning to Hong Kong was of great interest to the general public. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to Mr. Lu Si, the general manager of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company, to inquire whether the Jinshan steamer would sail to the province again or change its route after returning to Hong Kong. According to Mr. Lu, the Jinshan steamer's recent trip to the province was a trial run, not a complete resumption of the Guangdong-Hong Kong line. Currently, the company and the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou have not yet fully agreed on the restoration plan, and there are still some conditions under negotiation. It is still uncertain whether a satisfactory solution can be reached in the future. Therefore, the Jinshan steamer will not sail to Guangzhou again for the time being after returning to Hong Kong. Only after the negotiated conditions are properly resolved can this be discussed. The Jinshan steamer is scheduled to change course to Macau tomorrow (today) at 5:30 pm, returning to Hong Kong from Macau at 3:00 am the following morning. The future sailing schedule will continue as such, he said.</p>
<p>× Will Subsidize Various Shipping Companies</p>
<p>According to another unconfirmed report, the × side does not allow cargo to be carried on the resumed Guangdong-Hong Kong ships as a way to monopolize navigation rights on the Pearl River. However, in the current situation, if the Guangdong-Hong Kong ships resume operations, there will be very few passengers, making it difficult to maintain. The shipping companies are actually suffering significant losses. Therefore, for the resumption of the Guangdong-Hong Kong line, only carrying passengers is merely being used by the × side, and many companies are unwilling to make unnecessary losses. Many are considering abandoning the line and making other plans. It is said that the × side will provide limited assistance to compensate the losses of the shipping companies so that they can continue to operate. This is what was heard, but its accuracy remains to be verified.</p>
<p>Special Article from This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Interview with Mr. Lu Guangmian: A Discussion on China's New Industry in Development</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Wishing Visionary Capitalists to Actively Invest</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Guangmian, the director of the Northwest Regional Office of the China Industrial Cooperative Association, reported on the wartime industrial situation in the rear at yesterday's welcome meeting of the Women's慰勞会 (comforting association). This was noted in yesterday's newspaper. This reporter made another special visit to Mr. Lu yesterday and obtained many valuable materials that should be reported to overseas Chinese who are concerned about national affairs:</p>
<p>Mr. Lu returned to China from the United Kingdom in 1932. From 1933, he worked with Nankai University, the China Vocational Education Association, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Qilu University, and Jin Cheng Bank, among other groups, to form the North China Agricultural Improvement Society, dedicated to improving agriculture in North China. Because the work progressed smoothly and the enterprise developed rapidly, this North China Agricultural Improvement Society, together with the Economic Commission, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the North China Cooperation Committee, formed the semi-official North China Cotton Production Improvement Association. It achieved rapid progress in improving seeds, rural cooperation, educating the public, and transporting cotton to the United States..., laying the foundation for a new agriculture in the provinces of North China. In recent years, Mr. Lu has been working hard on this emerging enterprise, developing a relationship with North China.</p>
<p>When the July 7th Incident broke out, the association had more than one million loans that could not be recovered from farmers. With the expansion of the occupied areas, the work was naturally affected.</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, Mr. Lu was still in Beiping. He moved to the Pinghan Road area with his colleagues to carry out arduous organizational and production work. Until the China Industrial Cooperative Association was established last autumn, Mr. Lu took office as the head of the Organization Group and the director of the Northwest Regional Office, going to the Northwest to develop wartime industry.</p>
<p>In addition to various daily necessities, the association is currently able to produce military industries such as alcohol and bombs, and production is gradually increasing. According to Mr. Lu's practical experience, after a large number of refugees moved to the interior, the urgent task is to develop production, both to supply daily necessities and to lay the foundation for new industries; on the other hand, to enable refugees to participate in production work and prevent them from wandering. The greatest role is that because the people are organized and productivity is increased, before the local area is occupied, it can help the development of guerrilla warfare in various places. In the event that the local area is occupied, these organized production elements are the basic elements of the guerrilla team. This is indeed a problem worth considering in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Regarding the favorable conditions for wartime industrial development, the first is that there are many refugees, and manpower can be easily mobilized; the second is that the interior is rich in raw materials, making it easy to develop industry; the third is that the outbreak of war and the obstruction of transportation make imported goods scarce, which is an excellent opportunity to revitalize new industries. Mr. Lu briefly mentioned this in the welcome meeting the day before yesterday, but the difficulties in developing industry at present were not mentioned at that time, and I would like to ask the people of the country to pay special attention to them.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu's words to the reporter, the difficulties currently encountered in developing new industries are: The first is insufficient capital. Although the Executive Yuan has allocated a fund of 5 million yuan and a recurring expense of 500,000 yuan per year, to open various factories in various places on a large scale, the capital is still insufficient. At this time, the government has a hundred things to be done, and the power to develop industry is really only so much. Therefore, we can only hope that Chinese and foreign people will actively invest. Many foreign people with far-sighted vision have already enthusiastically assisted, and we also hope that the financial circles and capitalists at home and abroad will actively invest for the country and for the cause to facilitate the development of new industries. Whether viewed from the perspective of resistance or national construction, this is an extremely meaningful plan. Miss Pu Yihua De, a Westerner who came with Mr. Lu, is also responsible for appealing to Chinese and foreign people to actively invest. I believe that the visionary financial circles and capitalists will not miss this opportunity. China's War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the time when China's industry develops will also be the day when individual investment succeeds.</p>
<p>The second is the lack of talent. Many educated intellectuals mostly like to be officials and despise industry, which is also a reason why industry cannot develop. Today, we urgently need to change the general public's concept from education, eliminate erroneous ideas, take national interests as the premise, and make China a healthy modern country as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The third is the backwardness of technology and the lack of specialized talent. For example, there is a current shortage of imported matches, and the scales on bones everywhere are raw materials, but there is a lack of specialized talent to use and invent these readily available things. Recalling fifty years ago, when our relationship with foreign countries was distant, we were still able to produce various beautiful clothing items ourselves, which shows that we can independently produce with our own raw materials. Because we rely on imported goods, we have weakened our creativity instead. Now, we urgently need specialized talent to invent more in this area. For example, there is an extreme shortage of glass in the interior, and a small piece of glass is very expensive. Since the industrial sector developed the glass industry in the interior, the production of glass is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The above is a summary of what Mr. Lu said. Mr. Lu will return to Chongqing during the day and then go to the Northwest to continue his work. Offices will be set up in Hong Kong and various parts of Southeast Asia to facilitate the work. This is really an urgent matter at hand, and I deeply hope that the people of the country will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Overseas Chinese to Promote the Thrift Movement: Increasing the Economic Strength of the War of Resistance; Cultivating a National Frugal Spirit</h3>

<h3>A Guangzhou Tale of Blood and Tears</h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>Amidst the constant rumors of the resumption of Guangdong-Hong Kong navigation, the Jinshan steamer of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company finally carried passengers and returned to Guangzhou, the city of rams, which is the cultural essence of South China after the calamity. This trial voyage can be considered a success. Yesterday afternoon, this angel connecting Guangdong-Hong Kong traffic - the Jinshan steamer, crawled back to Hong Kong waters again, and also brought back many stories full of blood and tears that we cannot bear to hear. Here, let me introduce the general situation:</p>
<p>Guangzhou in ××</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th, the Jinshan steamer, driven by the morning breeze, surged forward through the blue waves. Four hours later, it had entered the territorial waters of the motherland. Humen, which dominates the corner of the sea, stands tall in the wind, quietly allowing the vast river water to batter it. All the steel cannons have been dismantled. Passing by "Xinzao" again, only ashes are seen flying, and there is no sound of people. Before long, the ship arrived at the provincial river. The first thing that catches the eye is the Xihoukou and the Xiguan area, the most lively places, which have all become scorched earth. The long Changdi embankment no longer has the enchanting scenery of Pearl Girls calling for ferries and tourists strolling. Only dilapidated cars and iron nets are piled up on Changdi to prevent people from smuggling. South of the provincial river and east of Jinghai Road is a desolate area with few inhabitants. The once prosperous and beautiful Wuyang has turned into ashes!</p>
<p>A World of Darkness</p>
<p>The most quintessential part of the city is the Daiheji area. Thousands upon thousands of hooligans, local bullies, robbers, prisoners, and all kinds of criminals have converged there. The human flesh market and the general assembly of dirty things are located there. Gambling and opium smoking are mixed together, making it extremely lively. There are very few who operate in firewood, rice, and daily necessities, so these things are particularly expensive.</p>
<p>Besides the × army, the ones maintaining law and order there are the Self-Defense Corps. These Self-Defense Corps are all "supernatural" types. Not to mention catching thieves, they are also trying to make money in various ways! Once dusk falls, shadows disappear, and the × army also returns to its nest. Robbers and thieves then act in all directions. Murder and robbery are like everyday meals. Even the most powerful old man dares not come out to interfere in such things. It is said that on the fifteenth night, more than a hundred households near Dajitou were robbed. The terrifying situation there can be seen. Therefore, there is a popular saying: "× army during the day, thieves at night"!</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××</p>
<p>Forced Use of × Currency</p>
<p>Compatriots staying in Guangzhou, in addition to receiving 'special' treatment in everything, must also obediently use × currency. The emperor's notices are posted on the streets. Those "military tickets" that are worthless when brought to Hong Kong must be used there, where the exchange rate is 30% higher for silver dollars and 80% higher per yuan for fractional currency. If you dare to utter half a "no," you will be arbitrarily labeled as "discriminating against × currency," and then your head will surely move!</p>
<p>An Interesting Story</p>
<p>Amidst the sounds of our army counterattacking Guangzhou and the elusive attacks of our heroic guerrillas, the × army is really anxious and disturbed in their dreams. It is said that the × army stationed on Phoenix Hill is close to the mountains and fields. At night, the fierce north wind rustles the weeds, and when the × people wake up from their dreams, they think it is the guerrillas coming, and they cannot help but panic. This needless worrying has happened countless times, so the × army decided to burn all the weeds to avoid future troubles. Who knew that not burning them would have been better, because burning them brought a major disaster. The reason is that there were two unexploded bombs buried there. The fire ignited the fuses, and with a loud bang, hundreds of × soldiers were blown to pieces and flew in the air. After this bombing, the × soldiers traveling alone dared not go far. What a ridiculous thing this is!</p>
<p>It is also heard that the rift between the × army and the navy is very deep. The navy issues boat flags of different clans, but they are often torn up by the × army, and the boat families are treated unfavorably. Even those boat households who have army passage flags are often refused passage by the × navy. Therefore, when sailing on the river, the boat households use navy flags, and when docking, they use army flags to cope with this helpless environment. But even so, they still often encounter unexpected disasters.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many facts that cannot be recorded, which is naturally a regret. However, I believe that everyone who sees the above facts will feel ashamed of Guangzhou on the one hand and miss Guangzhou on the other hand. Finally, they must be determined to eliminate all the darkness and return to Guangzhou!</p>

<h3>Diary on the Way from Wuzhou to Liuzhou</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>October 25, 27th Year [1938] Trapped in Wuzhou for nearly ten days, and again forced to flee to another place due to the changing situation. There are very few ships from Wuzhou to Liuzhou, because the spring flood season has passed, the water is shallow against the current, and even if small steamships are used to tow them, the journey of fifty or sixty miles takes four or five days. Moreover, it is rumored that the authorities are sealing the ships, and once they leave, they will never return. Most ships are unwilling to go, stopping only at Shilong in Xiang County. Beyond that, the flow against the current is turbulent, and there are many more dangers. It is better to transfer to a train to Liuzhou, which is safer. Here and now, the sound of the wind and grass is disturbing, and those who flee are ten times more numerous than ships. After trying all means, I finally secured only a few cabins. The ship is named Minfu and is towed by a steamship. Due to the loading of cargo, the departure is at midnight. Therefore, I have enough time to pack my luggage. However, the new house, which I have lived in for less than ten days, is neatly arranged. Once it must be abandoned. Such is the tongue of a refugee. By evening, it was rumored that Wushan would be under martial law after twelve o'clock. At ten o'clock, I hurriedly hired a porter to carry my luggage to the pier. Unexpectedly, the Minfu ferry was already full of passengers. Although I had reserved a cabin seat, the luggage was complicated and there was no way to deal with it. The open space was first occupied by those who were quick-footed. Even the ground was full of people, with almost no place to insert a foot. So I tried to stuff and hide the luggage, and the rest was piled on the cabin, forming a castle. After the busy work, I was covered in sweat. Fortunately, the ship set sail immediately, and the river wind blew, which was refreshing. Looking back at the shore, the lights were sparse. After ten days, Wuzhou said goodbye again. Tired from the late night work, I fell asleep, not knowing that I was on the ship.</p>
<p>October 26 Woke up from a dream, not knowing that the east had already turned white. After a while, the ship stopped, saying "We have arrived at Teng County." Guests boarded, mostly students returning to their hometowns, with no place to stay, only piling their luggage along the ship's edge and sitting on it. Teng County is the area I have visited before, and recently friends have temporarily stayed there. Looking into the distance, I can't help but feel a sense of vicissitudes. The ship is still stable in the river, no different from living in a house. However, Wu Jun's two sisters were seasick, not eating or drinking, not knowing why. Along the way, we passed through Mengjiang and Baima, where people got on and off, making it crowded and unbearable. Bored on the ship, there are mountains by the window. The scenery of western Guangdong is different from other places. However, Wuteng is not a scenic area in Guangxi, and I have been here several times, so I don't feel any strangeness. I brought a translated version of Tolstoy's Resurrection in my luggage and finished reading it, not knowing that the shipman had brought food. At dusk, the ship docked at Jiangkou. Jiangkou is a common name for locals, actually Dahuangkou. Small boats approached to sell cakes, pastries, pomelos, and oranges. Many people bought them. There was little cargo on the ship and people are hungry. There was no wind that night, it was sultry, and the ship did not sail in the heart of the river, fearing that the beaches along the way were dangerous and it would be difficult to travel at night.</p>
<p>October 27 We arrived in Guiping in the morning. Guiping is a major port on the waterway, with more Rong falling. I will move to the ground before I leave, so I can stretch my feet a little. There are often sandy beaches on the way, some stretching for several miles, desolate and useless, but the mountains and rivers are more picturesque, and you can look into the distance or look at them at eye level. The wonders of the mountains and rivers of western Guangdong are only beautiful here. Xu Xiake's so-called "turning the stream into a hole" water flow can be seen in its true form. Small boats passing here are reversing and flowing horizontally, inevitably tilting and sinking. The ancients called it a dead place, hidden in a wild area, which is probably not wrong. We moored in Wuxuan in the evening, and the wind picked up after dinner, which was a little cooler. It suddenly rained, and the roof of the ship leaked, soaking the beds everywhere. There was no way to arrange them. I rolled up the quilt and shrunk my feet, and didn't sleep well all night, unable to bear the misery.</p>
<p>October 28 Arrived at Shitou around 9 o'clock in the morning. After going ashore, the stone steps were very high, dozens of steps in all. It is said that only a few steps are exposed during the floods, so the state of the water can be imagined. Entering the town, there were no buses to Liuzhou that day, so I temporarily stayed in a hotel. The simplicity of the hotel made it unbearable to live in, but after a few days of hardship, drinking a cup of clear tea was like drinking sweet nectar.

<h3>Cargo Transportation at the North Shanghai Railway Station: Railway Staff and Tax Collectors' Multiple Layers of Exploitation; Unequal Freight Rates with Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) Since the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways fell into enemy hands, and the invaders, after military transport, allowed passenger and freight transport, the ruined and desolate North Railway Station has experienced a slight revival.</p>
<p>In the past, this metropolis—Shanghai—relied on the railways to bear the heavy responsibility of absorbing and releasing goods. On the railway side, there were the Mackinnon Road Station, the North Station, the Rihui Port Station, and the South Station. Now, the South Station is completely closed off. Although there were early rumors that the Mackinnon Road Station would open soon, it has not yet happened. The Rihui Port Station has a bit of cargo being unloaded due to its advantageous location on the Huangpu River, but there are no goods being shipped out because permission has not yet been granted. Besides these, there is only the North Railway Station. Currently, the North Station is relatively busy and lively, with cargo being shipped out and goods being transported in.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the situation of unloading cargo arriving at the North Station is not much different from the past. However, the unloaded cargo has no warehouse to be stored in and can only be piled up in the open air. Furthermore, after the abolition of *likin*, which the invaders once used as an excuse to criticize China for lacking organization and which had been absent for several years, tax collectors have now reappeared under the bayonets of the invaders. Brand new figures have risen and are reaching out for money for every item.</p>
<p>The situation of shipping out cargo is absolutely not as simple and smooth as it used to be. If you have goods to be shipped out, you must first register several days in advance. After the person in charge of registration allows you to register, they will give you a "cargo space permit" about the size of a bean curd. It specifies the date on which you are allowed to bring the cargo to the North Station. Only on that designated date can you bring the goods. However, you must first take this "cargo space permit" to the person in charge of cargo space and ask him to assign a location. At this time, if you only take the "cargo space permit," you will not get a location. You must give him five or ten yuan in legal tender to get your wish fulfilled. After the person in charge of cargo space approves your location, he will note the cargo space number on the "cargo space permit." Only then is the procedure complete, and you can bring your cargo to the designated cargo space for storage. If you do not get the approval of the person in charge of cargo space, the "cargo space permit" issued at the time of registration is equivalent to waste paper. Not only will there be no space for you to pile up, but even the soldiers guarding the vehicle yard gate will not let you pass with the cargo. Before August 13th, the North Station often had many goods awaiting shipment piled up in the open air or even on the roads outside the warehouse because there were too few warehouses. After the war, the few warehouses that existed were either destroyed or mostly unwilling to publicly store goods. Therefore, even if you spent money to buy cargo space, it is only an open space in the open air.</p>
<p>After the cargo is piled up in the cargo space, you must then request a vehicle to load it. This also requires spending twenty or thirty yuan of inexplicable money. Otherwise, even if you wait for several days, a vehicle will not be assigned. And Chinese-run transport companies cannot directly request a vehicle; they must entrust it to a foreign transport company. At the very least, they must hire a few foreign people. This, of course, requires spending a lot of unjust money. Furthermore, goods being shipped out must have a "procurement permit," which most Chinese-run transport companies cannot obtain. They can only temporarily spend twenty or thirty yuan per vehicle to buy one from others.</p>
<p>In the past, freight calculations were divided into six detailed grades. Now, they are roughly divided into three grades. However, less than a full vehicle load is not graded.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics, satin, groceries, etc., are first-class freight rates.</p>
<p>Artificial silk, cotton yarn, foreign cloth, native cloth, eggs, dried cocoons, flour, foreign candles, cigarettes, sugar, coal, iron, etc., are second-class freight rates.</p>
<p>Cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice, salt, etc., are third-class freight rates.</p>
<p>According to the above classification, we can clearly see its purpose. The so-called third-class goods, which have cheaper freight rates, are entirely Chinese bulk products and the things that the invaders urgently need.</p>
<p>The current freight rate from Shanghai to Hangzhou is two yuan and fifty-five cents per ton for a full vehicle load of second-class goods; to Nanjing, three yuan and sixty cents; Wuxi, two yuan and sixty cents; Suzhou, two yuan and twenty cents; Jiaxing, two yuan and thirty-five cents; Songjiang, two yuan and thirty cents, plus four types of miscellaneous fees such as loading fees and unloading fees, each costing sixteen cents per ton, totaling sixty-four cents. Furthermore, the Communication and Transportation Corporation charges an additional fifty cents per ton for full vehicle loads, regardless of distance, and an additional fifty cents per load for less than full vehicle loads. The so-called Communication and Transportation Corporation is the railway's freight manager, responsible for the appointment and expenses of all freight personnel on the entire line.</p>
<p>All the vehicles for loading goods on both lines were taken away when the Chinese army retreated to the west. The vehicles now in use were transported from elsewhere, each carrying fifteen tons, but charging freight for thirteen tons.</p>
<p>Due to the shortage of vehicles and their small size, there is insufficient allocation. Therefore, Chinese-run transport companies cannot directly request vehicles. Because the purpose of some people is to make illicit fortunes, just like in other places, it has created many situations of exploitation and extortion. The "staff" inside the station determines the amount of their special fees based on the quantity of goods and the number of vehicles each day. And many foreign transport companies or individuals, relying on their inherent advantages to obtain vehicles, do not load their own goods—or simply have no goods to load—and transfer them to unlucky Chinese people at high prices, like renting out a house.</p>
<p>Currently, goods transported to or from the North Station are subject to a 5% tax on the original price, collected by people sent there by the "Shanghai Municipal Government." Those tax-collecting clowns understand nothing but extortion. Therefore, when assessing the price, they often estimate it arbitrarily. If you want to reason with them, reason simply does not exist there. However, this does not mean that they are "loyal to their duties." The situation is often like this: for example, if you have a batch of goods, they want to estimate the original price at 3,000 yuan and donate 150 yuan. After agreeing, they write a donation ticket for 50 yuan, collect 50 yuan from you, and tell you about the rest. Contact someone in a certain place, which is often a large hotel or inn south of the Garden Bridge, or perhaps even a brothel. If you go there at eight or nine o'clock, you would have to pay him 100 yuan. But because this goes into his private pocket, you can get a 50% discount and only pay him 50 yuan.</p>
<p>If you paid the money in that place, if you want to know where their money went, just look around, and you will know everything: smoking opium, gambling, drinking, playing with women, the whole set. The tax-collecting clowns and foreign staff on the railway are exactly the same. Not only do they pocket the money for their own indulgence, but they sometimes also pull many transport company employees along to have fun until dawn, causing people to pay extra, not only materially but also spiritually.</p>
<p>Because the North Station is no longer desolate, people are renting the damaged houses on Qiujiang Road. The houses in this area are now considered confiscated. Therefore, when renting, you have to rent from the "Foreign Residents Group." The rent is about a few yuan per month, but what they give you is just a dilapidated house, not repaired. You have to repair it yourself. Therefore, some people rent a house and spend four or five hundred yuan to repair it. This kind of renting situation is truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Currently, the cargo transportation at the North Station is relatively busy. At the same time, the pockets of certain people, as well as hotels, inns, brothels, opium, gambling, and alcohol, are also busy. On the other hand, it is precisely the accelerated flow of the workers' blood and sweat. (Qi Xia)</p>

<h3>Overview of the Local Piece Goods Industry</h3>
<p>For decades, the Hong Kong piece goods market has been dominated by England, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The annual trade volume reaches 13-14 million yuan. For Hong Kong, a small place, to have such sales achievements is undoubtedly huge. Eight years ago, Japan's domestic industry gradually developed, and piece goods began to be transported to Hong Kong for sales. Because the goods were cheap and the styles were new, Chinese people mostly favored their low prices and good quality, and competed to buy them. Japanese goods gradually gained prominence in the Hong Kong market. Although European and American piece goods were of better quality, the price difference was too large, and the market was gradually eroded by the Japanese. Especially in the past five or six years, Japanese goods have become even more prosperous in the Hong Kong market, accounting for 60% of the total annual trade volume of piece goods in Hong Kong, while Europe and America only account for 40%. The goods that the Japanese transport to Hong Kong for sale are divided into winter and summer types. Winter goods are dominated by velvet, with the most styles, followed by mixed velvet and cotton velvet. Summer goods are mostly artificial silk fabrics, accounting for 90% of the imported goods. The rest are bamboo gauze, mixed cloth, white cloth, and linen cloth. Currently, the buckram sold in the Hong Kong market is all Japanese goods. Determining European and American goods, the annual European and American goods transported to Hong Kong have increased to more than three million yuan, which is much different from the one to two million yuan sold last year. The most imports from Europe and America this year are from England and Germany, followed by Italy, then France, and the least from the United States. Winter velvet includes wool clothing, overcoat, tuxedo yarn, light velvet, enterprise velvet, and sea tiger velvet. Summer goods are mostly bamboo gauze, mixed cloth, linen cloth, refreshing velvet, and white cloth. The United States mainly exports canvas. The goods transported to Hong Kong are not only sold locally, but most of them are transported to Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou Bay, and North China for sale. Before the war, European and American goods worth more than one million yuan were sold to Guangzhou annually, and Japanese goods worth more than two million yuan. In Fuzhou, Hankou, Xiamen, Changsha and other places, European and American goods accounted for more than one million yuan, and Japanese goods also accounted for more than four million yuan. North China mostly made purchases directly from Shanghai due to geographical reasons, so very few people came to Hong Kong to place orders. Also, Macau is not far from Hong Kong. Before the war, the annual sales of European, American and Japanese goods totaled more than one million yuan. However, after the war, places with trade relations with Hong Kong such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou were successively occupied, and the external sales of Hong Kong piece goods gradually decreased. After Guangzhou fell, the reduction was as high as 80%. Currently, the only remaining sales channel is Macau. Fortunately, because many people came to Hong Kong to take refuge, the two to three million yuan of European and American goods ordered by the Hong Kong piece goods industry this year have sold very well in the market, with more than seven out of ten orders already sold. Most of the silk shops in Hong Kong are capitalized by the Japanese, who want to use them to sell their goods.</p>

<h3>Hua Cup Hua League vs. Hai League: Li Huitang Invited to Participate; Hua League Lineup Should Also Be Improved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Exclusive] The second act of the Hua Cup football preliminary is the Chinese League team against the Naval League team, to be held on the 22nd of this month (Sunday) at 3:30 PM at the Hong Kong Stadium.</p>
<p>The Hua League representatives have already been selected, but because South China is leading its troops, they have not been able to return in time, and only two players staying behind, Tan Junqian and Liang Rongzhao, have been selected.</p>
<p>The Football Association believes that the already decided Hua League lineup is not perfect, fearing that the appeal is weak and the ticket revenue will be affected, because all the ticket revenue from this competition belongs to the Football Association.</p>
<p>The Football Association's annual expenses rely on the ticket revenue from this competition to make up for it, especially this year, when it is necessary to host the Philippine team to Hong Kong for the inter-port competition, which requires even greater expenses.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding this preliminary, the Football Association hopes that the Hua League can select first-class players to play in the game to increase its appeal and that the Hua League can win the final, because the Football Association's "business sense" is important, so it pins all its hopes on the Hua League.</p>
<p>This time, the Hua League representatives have not lived up to expectations, and the Football Association is especially anxious, fearing that the Hua League will be defeated as soon as it plays, and the final will be a match between Western teams. Chinese spectators will definitely be unhappy, so this business will have less profit.</p>
<p>For this reason, a member of the Football Association strongly invited Li Huitang to help the Hua League at that time, and Huang Jiajun also acted as a matchmaker, asking Mr. Li to make it difficult for him and avoid disappointing the Football Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Li told reporters yesterday, "A member of the Football Association cordially invited me, and I am very grateful. It is not convenient for me to refuse to do my best to achieve both goals, but since I have participated in the competition, I do not know how the already decided Hua League lineup will change."</p>
<p>Mr. Li's statement means that he will definitely participate in the competition, and his spirit of righteousness is a model for the sports world and is also good news for general fans. In particular, this time the Hua League has his participation, and the dangerous elements of being eliminated will be reduced.</p>
<p>I remember that since the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese football community in Hong Kong has received the support of the Football Association every time it has held a charity match. This time, although the ticket revenue of the Li Hua Cup match is all returned to the Football Association, we should also do our best to help him, give peach and reward plum, and there should be reciprocity, so Mr. Li's agreement to participate this time is very meaningful.</p>
<p>The selected Hua League representatives should not be overturned in principle, but this time it is to increase the Football Association's revenue, so it may be possible to act with authority to make it happen. Therefore, the reporter has a suggestion for the Hua League's lineup at the time of the game for Li Huitang's participation.</p>
<p>The position of goalkeeper has already been determined by Tan Junqian, so there is no need to change it. Moreover, Li Huitang once said that in the past, he and Lao Tan had never failed in any competition they participated in in the same team, so you can use their lucky partner together.</p>
<p>The right inside guard should choose Hou Rongsheng of Guanghua. In the current situation, I think it is satisfactory. It seems inappropriate to use Miao Huaguo as the left inside guard. Although he has improved recently and his header is better, his movements are too slow, which is a fact that everyone has seen. The right wing of the Hai League, Armstrong, is very powerful, and I am afraid that Lao Miao will not be able to resist it. Using Song Lingsheng is also not possible, which is no different from cutting feet to fit shoes, and he has rarely played inside guard. If used improperly, it will be a burden. In my opinion, Luo Weiquan is the most suitable, because Lao Luo's foot is strong enough. In every small-scale game, he is the one who makes things happen. Taking the small to compare with the big has a meaning. If he is selected, I believe he will be able to do the job happily.</p>
<p>The center midfielder should choose Liang Rongzhao, and he has been very careful about passing the ball recently, and he is brave and energetic. The right midfielder is an ideal candidate for Song Lingsheng. He has ball skills, is good at flanking, and is better than Liu Shizhan. The left midfielder should use Xu Jingcheng. If so, the entire midfielder line will be so strong that even if the inside guard is weaker, there is no need to worry with the strong cover of the midfielder.</p>
<p>The left and right wings must belong to Hou Chengtuo and Chen Bingshi. There is no doubt about it. The only thing to consider is the three forwards. In my opinion, since Li Huitang is the center forward, there must be a good ball-supplying inside forward to assist Li Fang in easily advancing. This good ball-supplying person is none other than Zou Wenzhi. He has also cooperated with Chengtuo before. If he is selected as the left inside forward, he will definitely have an understanding performance with Chengtuo and will definitely assist Huitang in attacking. It is quite difficult to find a right inside forward, but Zhuo Shijin can be recruited. His long-range shooting skills are somewhat like Huitang's style.</p>
<p>If the forward line is selected as I suggested, I dare say that the offensive power will definitely be strong. What's more, Huitang, Shijin, and Chengtuo are all good shooters, which will make the Hai League guards sigh for neglecting one thing and paying attention to another. What do you think of the wise, do you think it is so? The lineup suggested by the reporter is recorded below. (Ballpark Tycoon)</p>

<h3>On the Necessary Understanding of Deep Breathing</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>The benefits of deep breathing can be summarized into the following six types:</p>
<p>(1) Exercise the lungs and expand the chest.</p>
<p>(2) Purify the blood, normalize blood circulation, and strengthen the heart.</p>
<p>(3) Enhance the capabilities of various organs, making their functions active and normal.</p>
<p>(4) Invigorate the spirit and strengthen the body.</p>
<p>(5) Restore fatigue, relax the body, treat insomnia, and strengthen the nervous system.</p>
<p>(6) Suppress emotional impulses, prevent violent anger, and worry, making the body and mind comfortable and promoting mental health.</p>
<p>Although deep breathing is a very simple and effective exercise, if we lack a deep understanding of this exercise or rush it, the result will not only fail to reap the maximum benefits, but often suffer harm instead.</p>
<p>Here are the necessary understandings we should have about deep breathing:</p>
<p>(1) We should not use deep breathing exercises as the only tool to exercise the chest. Deep breathing exercises should be carried out together with other exercises that focus on developing muscles or exercising strength, or after this type of exercise. For example, when performing dumbbell exercises, deep breathing can be done for about one minute after completing two or three exercises; or after completing all the exercises, deep breathing can be done for about three minutes. If you do deep breathing exercises at ordinary times, the effect is small, because the air we need during exercise is often seven or eight times more than usual. The lung's capacity for air is limited at noon, and it cannot accept a large amount of air. If it is forced too much, it will be harmful.</p>
<p>When performing other exercises, you should also do deep breathing at any time. Otherwise, there is not only a risk of harm to your body, but you will often feel rapid heartbeat, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Although many exercises require rapid movements and cannot be performed with deep breathing at the same time, no matter what, we must not stop breathing when exercising or exerting force. When breathing is difficult or rapid, you can temporarily use your mouth to breathe, because this can quickly inhale a large amount of air.</p>
<p>(3) Although it is not advisable to overdo deep breathing, it is also not very effective if you only do it for a few minutes a day. We must always fill our chests with fresh air, so our body must have the correct posture so that we can do deep breathing at any time.</p>
<p>(4) To reap the maximum benefits from deep breathing exercises, you must pay attention to the chest cavity, chest bones, lungs, chest muscles, shoulder muscles, and diaphragm, so that the functions of each part are active and normal.</p>
<p>As for the method of deep breathing, we should pay attention to the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Unless breathing is difficult or rapid, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. However, when encountering cold wind or cold weather, in order to avoid catching a cold, you should still inhale through your nose, and do not breathe into the wind.</p>
<p>(2) When inhaling, the muscles of the whole body should be completely relaxed, not tightened or forced, and the posture should be natural.</p>
<p>(3) When inhaling, the abdomen should be expanded as much as possible, and when exhaling, the abdomen should be contracted as much as possible.</p>
<p>(4) When exhaling, cross your arms in front of your chest and compress your chest forcefully to completely expel the air from.</p>
<p>When exercising or exerting force, you must try to make your breathing deep, long, and thorough at the same time to avoid injury, but at this time, the first thing to pay attention to is the correct breathing method. There are only two breathing methods during exercise:</p>
<p>(1) Inhale when exerting force and exhale when relaxing.</p>
<p>(2) Exhale when the chest and abdomen are compressed and inhale when they are expanded.</p>

<h3>Movies and Theater</h3>
<p>Entertainment... Social Thugs</p>
<p>The Last Gangster</p>
<p>Edward Robinson plays a thug who does all kinds of evil. The success of his past works proves that he is an outstanding talent. His superb acting skills and meticulous character performance have won unanimous praise from every audience.</p>
<p>In this film, he plays a thug who commits all kinds of evil, murders and steals, disregards the law, and manipulates the evil forces of the entire society. He is domineering, arrogant, and invincible, but in the end, for the sake of his virtuous wife and loving children, he sacrifices everything, including his own life, and ends up in a very tragic end.</p>
<p>Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of great talent, with a very moving scene. The cast includes James Stewart and Ruth Strickland. At the same time, in this film, we also see a most perfect cast of thief actors in Hollywood. All the tense and moving plots in this "Social Thug" will give the audience a large and strong new stimulus.</p>
<p>Queen... Mischievous Boy's Acting Record</p>
<p>This long and funny film, led by Tom Kelley and a group of mischievous boys, is Tom's work after "Mischievous Boy's Biography", but because of the story, it is obviously not as touching as the previous one. However, the director's handling of this film is very lively and vivid. Several gimmicks are still satisfactory. The various performances of the circus are very wonderful, and the performances of a group of child stars are very outstanding. In the end, it is still an entertaining film.</p>
<p>Peace... Knight's Brother's Thief Breaking Record</p>
<p>North of the Rio Grande</p>
<p>This is William Beke's work after "Knight Friend's Thief Drama Record". It is also a story about the American Western knight Garchette. This time, because his brother was shot and killed by robbers, and he failed to get justice in court, Garchette was eager to avenge his brother, disguised himself as a gambler, and hid in the gambling den to secretly investigate the real murderer. After repeated dangers, he finally avenged his brother and eliminated a major harm in the West. The plot is quite tortuous. William Beke also has a more wonderful performance in this film than the previous film.</p>
<p>East... Frontier Flying General</p>
<p>Border Flight</p>
<p>A film about smuggling. The story is plain. The scenes of several battles in the air with bandits are quite exciting and moving. Frances Farmer and John Howard's performances are mediocre.</p>
<p>Great China... Midnight Piano</p>
<p>Moonlight Sonata</p>
<p>This is a musical romance film. What is worth noting is the famous pianist Peter Luskowski, Padreswskf. The film structure is based on Peter Luskowski's piano performance as the center of the story. In the concert, his superb art moved the entire audience, especially a young couple. At the request of the audience, he replayed "Midnight Piano", followed by his oral account of how a young couple was moved by "Midnight Piano" when their love broke down and reconciled as before, which is the story of this film.</p>
<p>In addition to Peter Luskowski's art being worth appreciating, the plot and performance are slightly dull, with more dialogue than action, which cannot get rid of the British film style. Charles Ford has lost his dashing spirit of the year.</p>
<p>Scene Star... Smart Girl</p>
<p>Always in Trouble</p>
<p>Consistent style, attitude of smart and witty matchmaking, finally yacht competition, both funny and tense, Kim Hye-soo performed very well.</p>
<p>Central... Drama</p>
<p>Chinese Art Troupe</p>
<p>Day Performance... Exuberant Elation</p>

<h3>Movement and Stillness</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——Impressions of a Battlefield Trip</p>
<p>One clear early winter morning, I climbed alone from the Goose Lake Academy along the leaning pagoda to the summit of Mount Fengding; the morning sun was just rising, and the thick fog filled the valley. The white camellias by the roadside were covered with dewy moisture, which made them particularly vibrant. That day, I don't know whether it was this famous philosopher - the meeting place of Zhu and Lu, which aroused my nostalgia? Or was it the cold and solemn atmosphere of early winter that stimulated my meditation? I always felt a little different in my chest, thinking silently and walking slowly, thinking that Zhu and Lu had different ideas when they discussed learning here, they walked hand in hand, sometimes silently, sometimes arguing fiercely, and sometimes tacitly understanding each other. Did they also think that thousands of years later, from the same to the different, from the different to the same, many magnificent waves would be opened up?</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking deeply, the rattling sound of six aircraft interrupted my thoughts; at that time, I suddenly turned my mind and raised the following question: Suppose Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan were both born in modern times. And Lu Ziqian (a master of the Jinhua School), who had some different views from Zhu and Lu, also came to Goose Lake to participate in the discussion; when the three of them were arguing fiercely, the × people's planes flew over. What would be the attitude of the three of them? This is very thought-provoking. Lu Xiangshan might sit upright, with little change in his expression, and Wei Xi might think of the sage's way of exercising power and the ancient motto of "a gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall". As for Lu Ziqian, he probably immediately stopped participating in the debate, feeling that digging air-raid shelters was more practical than philosophical debate. After the planes passed; who is right and who is wrong, everyone's pen tip can be broken; but if the disciples in the Goose Lake Academy are young people who are currently studying, their judgment can be made immediately, because they believe that the × people's planes will really drop bombs and blow Lu Jiuyuan, who is sitting upright, into meat patties. They will feel that the realistic path taken by the Jinhua School is the right path.</p>
<p>When I went down the mountain, the top of the leaning pagoda touched my another kind of thought: Goose Lake Academy, this sacred place of Confucianism, and Hongji Temple on Mount Fengding, that sacred place of Buddhism, what kind of interaction is there between them? Could it be that the leaning pagoda at the foot of the mountain is the dividing line between your territory and mine, and they will not glare at each other? Or is Lu Xiangshan's attitude closer to the side of Mount Fengding, Zhu Xi belongs to the circle of Goose Lake Academy, and Lu Ziqian is outside the circle of Goose Lake? Their disciples have fundamentally different attitudes towards the monks of the mountain temple. Continuing to pursue in this way, the problem becomes more and more complicated; that morning, a kind of philosophy of life, a philosophy of life in troubled times, matured in my heart.</p>
<p>Between Mount Fengding and Goose Lake, there are fundamentally different views on life; Buddhism advocates the beauty of stillness, taking "Nirvana" as the destination of life, Confucianism advocates the beauty of movement, taking "self-improvement" as the great way of "change". Lu is inclined to Buddhism, so he advocates "clarifying the mind and seeing the nature", Zhu is inclined to Confucianism, so he advocates "investigating principles and dealing with affairs". Lu Ziqian, Ye Shuixin, Chen Tongfu, and the Yan Li School in the early Qing Dynasty, are closer to Confucianism, so they advocate "experiencing worldly affairs and thoroughly studying economics". (Economics refers to democratic economics.) The beauty of stillness is easy to understand, and people in middle age understand the taste of leisure and comfort. The beauty of movement can only be appreciated if you have the courage to face reality head-on; following the movement, what is in front of you is a messy reality. People who are used to a leisurely life only know that the mess is just joking with their life order, and no old rules can allow them to deal with it properly. Turmoil makes their heads hurt, constantly. When he knows that under the turmoil, the stream of life is active, and the stream of life is leaping forward, it makes his head hurt again. This is why Zhu Xi is confined to the circle of Goose Lake, and Confucianism can only survive in the doctrine of the mean. In troubled times, "the doctrine of the mean" is not enough, you have to have a more positive attitude towards life.</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes, "Young people have more heat and less light, and middle-aged people have more light and less heat". The turbulent world is a world of fire, and only people with more heat can catch up with it. ——January 1, 1939</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Death is the most painful and the most difficult. Therefore, the general public's concept of death is sometimes a curse and sometimes praise.</p>
<p>Death is the most painful, objectively. "When the living bid farewell to the dead, there is no arguing about regret," In other words, only the living will feel the pain of death. Death is the most difficult, subjectively. Everyone is afraid of death, but if you can abandon everything and bravely tend towards death, then it is difficult. Therefore, death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai. Dying when you shouldn't die, dying when you don't have to die, is lighter than a feather; dying when you should die, daring to die when you must die, is heavier than Mount Tai. The former's death, because the death is not in the right place, will not only fail to win social sympathy, but on the contrary, because he leaves a bad impression, he will also be cursed by society. The latter's death, because he died in the right place, gives people the story of loyalty and integrity, which is a model for those who die later, so it is worth praising.</p>
<p>In this war of resistance, there are too many stories of death. The soldiers in the front are dying in the thousands for the people, for the country, and for justice, before the god of war. They are the dead soldiers of the Republic of China and the pioneers of justice and public reason. History will not fail to solemnly record their heroic sacrifices and their spirit of regarding death as home; this is not to mention for the time being. There are also many stories of committing suicide for righteousness and scandals of corpses lying in the streets in the occupied areas. These many deaths not only have distinctions between lightness and weight, but also between compliance and defiance.</p>
<p>According to this newspaper's Taixian correspondent: Xu Shizhu, a Zhenjiang educator who once served as the director of the Dantu County Education Institute and the director of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, is from Dagang Township, Zhenjiang. His morality and articles have always been respected by his fellow villagers and people in the community. Recently, because his nephew Xu conspired against the country in the township, he tried to persuade him to break away but failed. He believed it was a great shame and humiliation, and committed suicide by jumping into the river in Xinzhou a few days ago to serve the country. Those who are willing to be traitors should be ashamed to death. It is said that Xu was very regretful when he learned of the news that he committed suicide by jumping into the river to serve the country.</p>
<p>Xu Shizhu committed suicide by jumping into the river because his nephew conspired against the country and failed to stop him. This is not only clarifying shame, but also clarifying ambition. This kind of behavior is of course deeply moving and worthy of respect! However, although his death has considerable value, his attempt to use this method of dying to persuade his unfilial nephew to repent is still debatable.</p>
<p>Traitors have no soul, they do not know what is called integrity, what is called integrity. Our only solution to this group of beasts in clothing, traitors to the nation, is "kill without pardon". Persuasion is useless. Since Mr. Xu Shizhu had the courage to die after the lesson of "forcefully persuading him to break away but failing", if he could not add a white blade to his unfilial nephew and put him to death, remove a scoundrel for the country, and fight for a little righteousness for the world, he could launch a widespread movement to eliminate traitors and awaken the awareness of the compatriots in the occupied areas. If this leads to the consequence of death, then death is more valuable and more difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, we recognize: we must have the courage to die, and at the same time, we must have the will to die to demand the price of death.</p>
<h3>I Love Firelight</h3>
<p>— Luo Xi</p>
<p>I love the wild fire that will ignite a thousand feet of light in the dark night, it can illuminate: who is the real human, who is the jackal in human face!</p>
<p>Although fire will burn down prosperous cities, fire will burn down beautiful mountain villages; but this is the alternation of the new and the old, not a permanent disaster!</p>
<p>Jackals that eat people will run everywhere, and the light of wild fire will rush up everywhere; no one has a place to escape or hide!</p>
<p>On the earth, millions of oppressed children have sung in unison to the sky-high firelight:</p>
<p>"Only resistance, can there be liberation! Our will is a strong sentry post; our fists are unparalleled knives and guns!"</p>
<p>Towards the fierce jackals, millions of people have merged into a滔heavenly huge wave. They will press the jackals down on the mountain of bones, and they will immerse the dregs in the rivers formed by hot blood; after the wild fire is extinguished, they will build more prosperous cities and more beautiful mountain villages on the earth stained with blood and flesh!</p>
<p>Yes, I love firelight!</p>
<h3>Xin Hui Oranges</h3>
<p>— Wu Chonghan</p>
<p>Of Xin Hui's produce, the two most important are the palm frond and the oranges.</p>
<p>Xin Hui oranges have a clear, sweet taste, and after winter, they have a particularly appealing fragrance, known as "orange fragrance," which is beloved by the people of Lingnan. Oranges have been famous since ancient times, with Qu Yuan having written "Ode to the Orange." It is a pity that this fruit is prone to spoilage and cannot be stored for long or transported far, so its market is limited to Guangdong.</p>
<p>Every year around the Double Ninth Festival, oranges come onto the market. Initially, they are green, then they turn yellow, and finally, they turn a golden yellow. At this point, the oranges are ripe. In Lingnan, especially in Xin Hui, who doesn't love oranges?</p>
<p>A few days ago, Sister Yun came from Xin Hui, overcoming obstacles and difficulties, and brought me two baskets of oranges. They were golden and dazzling. I was extremely grateful to her for being so thoughtful during this time of fleeing from the war, crossing rivers and mountains, and painstakingly bringing these two baskets of oranges.</p>
<p>"They are just worthless things, what is there to be grateful for?"</p>
<p>Sister Yun suddenly sounded sad. I almost misunderstood, thinking she was just being modest.</p>
<p>Sister Yun's livelihood is growing oranges. This is her family's tradition, passed down for generations. In Xin Hui, many people make a living this way. Some cultivate dozens of acres of orange trees, while others cultivate only a few acres. If there is a bumper year, without floods, droughts, wind, or rain, the growers can make a good profit. Some can become wealthy, while others can at least make a living. The people of Xin Hui rely on this for their livelihood, just like those who cultivate palm fronds. This year happens to be a bumper year, with abundant harvests of rice and oranges.</p>
<p>"A bumper harvest of oranges means they are worthless!"</p>
<p>From her sorrowful tone, I understood what Sister Yun meant.</p>
<p>"In past years, oranges cost five or six yuan per catty, and as high as ten or twenty yuan when the price was high. This year, they are only worth a yuan or so, and even a few jiao, and no one is interested. They are extremely cheap! Worthless junk, not worth anything!"</p>
<p>Sister Yun continued to explain the reasons why oranges are so cheap:</p>
<p>"It's entirely due to the * bandits invading from the south. Guangzhou has fallen, and there is no market for oranges. The roads to the outside are blocked everywhere. Xin Hui oranges are only eaten by the people of Xin Hui."</p>
<p>She sighed and said:</p>
<p>"A year of hard work has come to nothing! The capital is lost - the oranges are too cheap. Picking them to sell doesn't even cover the cost. It's better to leave them on the trees to ripen, rot, and fall, even if it makes the fields dirty. The orange growers are bankrupt! Some orange growers, driven by hunger and cold, have even listened to the foolish suggestions of others and secretly transported oranges to Guangzhou, hoping to recover some of their capital. However, this kind of behavior is no different from being a traitor! I would rather starve to death than be a * slave!"</p>
<p>Sister Yun was still indignant. I know how difficult it is for them to grow oranges this year. However, with the * bandits running rampant, who can avoid such hardships?</p>
<p>"With the nation in crisis, there are bound to be many changes. It's not like the peaceful days of the past.</p>
<p>'This year, smiling faces greet parents,</p>
<p>The fragrance of golden oranges fills the trees.'</p>
<p>I've heard you sing this folk song many times."</p>
<p>"We don't sing it that way anymore!"</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"It's changed!"</p>
<p>"What's the new version?"</p>
<p>"Today, who picks the oranges?</p>
<p>Golden trees everywhere, eyes filled with tears!"</p>
<p>As Sister Yun said this, her eyes filled with tears again!</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Military Life</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>This old man was once educated in a private school. In his youth, he traveled and did some things, and because of these connections, we were able to get along and reduce the common aversion that villagers have towards soldiers. Indeed, he never showed any annoyance towards us, or, like some villagers, deliberately made things difficult by insisting that we shouldn't use too much water, that we shouldn't get the ground dirty, or that we had used his bamboo poles. This old man was not like that—because of his understanding of the war of resistance, he not only didn't make things difficult but also cared for these brothers in uniform.</p>
<p>"Aren't you staying a few more days?" he asked, seemingly reluctant to see us go. His wife, the old woman who washed our clothes every day, came out of the inner room, as if she had heard our conversation, and added:</p>
<p>"Comrades..." she had already become familiar with these two words, "Are you about to leave?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"We haven't treated you well."</p>
<p>"Not at all, we've been a bother to you."</p>
<p>"Don't be polite," the old man interjected, shaking his feather fan, "If it were peacetime, you wouldn't even come to visit."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>Regarding this question, we have always been unable to tell the truth to others. Because there are too many traitors, even good people must be treated with caution. Therefore, whenever anyone asks about our marching route, we always answer, "We'll go ahead and see." We use this to brush them off.</p>
<p>The first part of the marching route is already known to everyone: "Huilong Street - Fangjiaping - Jiuhe Street - Daoguan River - Taojiapu - Baiguo - Caoxiedian - Macheng - Wujia River - Xidao River - Huangtugang - Zhangdian - Futian River - Liushudian -"</p>
<p>Everyone packed their luggage and everything was ready, just waiting to be put on their backs. (To be continued)</p>
