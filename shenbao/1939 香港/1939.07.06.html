<h3 id="c1">國際「中國週」的重大意義 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自從我們發動神聖的抗戰以來，國際閒對我們表示最大的同情並作最積極帮助的，是各國人民。他們最能深刻認識中國抗戰在人類史上的重大意義，所以他們的聲援最坦誠，他們的援助也最積極。我們爲擁護眞正和平及人類正義而抗戰已滿兩個整年，所以同情我們最深切援助我們最積極的國際的朋友們，又發起紀念「七七」的「中國週」了。紐的的美國人團體舉行了「中國週」，華盛頓的中美居民也將舉行「七七」游行，幷聞民主黨參議員湯姆斯。及美國總工會等團體領袖也要參加。其他各地如芝加哥及紐約彼斯頓，也將舉行瀰撒禮。英國援華委員會，日前也發起「中國週」，以策動英國輿論界，共起援助中國，並且特別發行日刊，定名爲「中國新聞」，其作用尤爲重大。英國紀念中國抗戰的意義特別重大。</p>
<p>今日各國人民的同情和輿論的作用，特別値得我們注意。我們知道×人侵華戰爭已相當疲敝，微聞他們的內部經過最近的糾紛與爭執之後得到一個大致的結論，一致希望在本年秋間結束戰爭以拯救本身的危亡，並欲以外交手段代替車事行動。當此時候，日本最希望的是英國出頭調停，天津事件就是集中的表現。英國幷且已在某程度上對日表示讓步了。這點固然已受到英國人民很大的批評，但是就目前的情勢看來，英國政府當局的作法，還需要更熱烈的監督。在昨日的「中國新聞」上載有名小說家勃里科萊的社評，其中稱：「吾人務必設法勿使英國政策有利於橫暴的侵略者，反之，吾人當使之援助克苦沉毅的抵抗者」。這是多應偉大的警告和督責！</p>
<p>英國方面，「中國人民之友社」最爲發達，倫敦爲其大本營，牛津，劍橋，曼却斯特，利物浦等地皆有分社之設。中國人民之友社是援華最積極的團體，我們相信他們當能更積極監督英國政府此後的遠東政策的動向。倫敦將於「七七」舉行民衆大會，其必於矯正英國政策有積極的表示，是我們可以科預的。</p>
<p>英國是民冶國家，政府的政治外交的方針都要受人民的監督指導。這種威力表現於上下議院的質問，人民的輿論與行動上。英國政府素來受着這種威力的監責。目前，英國有三種重大的事件要愼重解决：其一是怎樣對府遠東的日本，其二是怎樣對付歐洲的德意，其三是怎樣卽速完成英蘇法三國陣協定。而這三者都有密切的關係，都不外乎是反侵略陣綫的締結工作。英國能否正確處理這些問題，影響世界的正義與和平，有莫大的關係。因此，這個時候英國人民所負的責任，特別　重大，我們希望英國人民能利用這個紀念英勇抵抗侵略者的紀念日，在言論及行動，有更具體而有效的表示！</p>

<h3 id="c2">平地游擊戰爭論 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 周士梯</p>
<p>（四）一般的禁止使用印有番號的信封信紙，印有番　的信封信紙，只限於對友軍或政權機關的重要正式公文才有使用，但以越少越好。</p>
<p>（五）行軍時要捲起旗子　路標要用記號，後衞部隊要有專門人員收路標，及消滅行軍經過遺留的痕跡。必要時—可故設假路標以欺騙人。白天行軍要注重僞裝，夜問行軍不準食烟點火！和有聲講說及其他音響。</p>
<p>（六）號房子須用代字，在行軍途中的鼓動標語，為可放置於露天空場與應盡可能的對空蔭蔽處，防×空　偵察。</p>
<p>（八）接近×區的地區宿營，要很好封鎖消息，先派便衣偵察人員進到宿營地，禁止羣衆去×方，　戒部隊須禁止羣衆出警戒綫，但須很好向羣衆解釋，如必要出去，和情况許可時，須由部隊中派人帶去或給放行條，但放行條上不應寫番號。</p>
<p>（九）首長　地形時，不可多帶人員，並須蔭蔽，最好是均穿便衣，盡可能不騎馬，（如騎馬時，　留在較遠的後面。）</p>
<p>（19）伏擊時，封鎖消息更爲重要，必頃做到無一個羣衆走流消息，就是經過伏擊地點的羣衆，亦須很好解釋囘來。據×人對我東北義勇軍『討伐』動作的材料中說：『判斷村落中有無×之的一例；第一，村落中沒有×人時，人民子女在門前嬉戲，田地裏有村民；第二，×人在村　近傍時，田地內無人，門閂起來，男子在屋上迴視：第三，×在村子內時找不到人影，在秋收時期，秋收的刈割也中止起來。』所以如在伏華地點對封銷時，完全不見人　和動作，則×人卽可判斷我軍有埋伏，故我們須派出僞裝人員，在出中工作，在村落中行動，這些僞裝人員在戰爭時卽參加戰爭，亦是有利的。</p>
<p>羣眾工作</p>
<p>平地建立游擊根據地，主要的依靠於羣衆條件。平地羣衆很多但這祇是條件的一方面，主要的是要靠我們去發動組織領幹起來，去和×人進行艱苦的鬥爭，才能表現羣衆的偉大的不可征服的力量，這才完成所謂依靠羣衆的條件。</p>
<p>在平地活動的部隊，對羣衆工作要注意如下幾個中心問題：</p>
<p>（一）要有高度的政治紀律，羣衆對部隊第一次見面認識的經常以部隊的律爲標準，所以每個人員都要開始遵守政治紀律以嚴肅的羣衆紀律來取得羣衆的擁護與信仰。</p>
<p>（二）要以積極的行動，要以戰鬥的勝利，去與奮羣眾，提高其抗日情緒與勝利信心。</p>
<p>（三）羣衆工作是我們整個工作中最重要的一環，不要看爲僅是政治機關，政　人員民運工　作者的工作，我們每一人員都應成爲宣傳組織領導羣衆的模範，參加羣衆工作最積極的一員。</p>
<p>（四）愛護羣衆，深入到羣衆的閒題，接受羣衆的意見，而且要向羣衆學習，與羣衆打成一片。</p>
<p>（五）保護羣衆利益，改善羣衆生活，給羣衆以民生自由。（完）</p>

<p>【中央社重慶五日電】四日爲美國獨立紀念日、孔院長特對美國人士廣播演講、襄示我國對目前中美密切關係之欣慰、感謝美國在我國抗戰建國期中所給予我國之　動與　叻、茲將孔院長演辭鐸述如次：</p>
<p>今日爲美國宣布獨立一百六十三週年紀念、余得以在此紀念日對美國人士說話、殊感欣快、余謹代表中國民衆、向諸位致其摯誠之頌祝、敬祝前途　榮無限、世界上具有自由思想者、對於偉大的美洲共和國少產生、應表示慶祝、美國之宣佈獨立、不特爲人類自由平等之最髙主義的表現、且建立一個國家、而該國對於人類進步及世界和平與秩序之貢献、幷不亞於其他任何國家、貴國之產生、對於現代民治主義之生長、實予以英大之激勵、貴國民族之歷史、充滿人類的堅忍奮鬥之偉大的事績、如墾荒者、殖邊者、機器時代、現代商業及實業、平民突起而執政、以及改進人類生活等偉大事續、貴國之偉大進步、若使整個世界皆得如美國所有之保持和平幸福之機會、則人類生活可提至髙度水準、貴國對於『門戶開放一原則、九國公約、及　洛公約等之努力、造成責國在國際間之地位與榮譽、余今日與諸君同伸慶祝、余若不向諸位表示我國對於中美兩國的悠久親切關係之欣快、及對貴國在我國抗戰　國期中所給予我國之豉勵與援助的感謝、余當不能代表我國民衆說話矣、在商業、敎育、文化、及國際事務方面、美國已成爲中國之好友及　導者、最近貴國政府購買中國白銀及延長中國借欵信用期限之辦法、已給予我國以維持財政及法幣之實際援助國人士之振濟中國乓災、給予我國同情及精　援助、便合人於爭取自由之堅决抗戰中獲得鼓勵、中國民衆感謝　國人士之友誼、此友誼實建築在兩民族間之密切關係基礎上者也、</p>
<p>余今日未能與諸君歡叙一堂、但諸位或有尙憶兩年前、余會在貴國參加光榮的七四慶祝大會者、當日之也界、比今日較爲惀快、蓋今日吾人已爲戰爭及戰謠所財擾也獨立宣言以及中美兩國共同　護之國際協定、所給予吾人之奮興、今日已受發現於世界大部份土地之戰爭及侵略所影響、理解及調協之精神、已屈服於野蠻暴力、國際法律及公約之尊嚴已給踐踏、國際安全制度已感受莫大威脅、人類似已被迫走進另一個「黑暗時代」、人類步將被阻止、文化已瀕於危境、世界四份一人口之爭取獨立戰爭、發生在中國土地上已兩週年矣、日本之現代軍械、每天造成我國無辜民衆之死亡與毀滅、摧殘我國未設防之城市及遠離前綫子百里之偏僻鄉鎭、日本侵略所帶來之恐怖、殘暴及鉀法無大之行爲、不特爲二十世紀文明人數所不容、抑亦觸犯人類理智奧莊嚴、現在余說話之地點、乃一具有此種不幸經驗之城市、曾迭通日本飛機濫炸、無辜民衆慘遭屠殺、平民產業慘遭炸燬、</p>
<p>日本之炸彈與機關槍、果能嚇便中國民衆屈眼乎、吾人之共和國、年齡雖少、國制固與貴國相同、然而我國果在日本侵略下滅亡乎、申國四萬五千萬靈魂皆曰「否」、日本之恐怖手段、不能摧毀吾人精神、不能毀滅我國國魂、只有堅定吾人之抵抗意志而已、吾人以不完慌之軍械抗戰固有困難、但吾人具有抗戰到底之决心、吾人堅决抗戰、兩載於今、打破日軍無×之謎、吾人决繼續抗戰、下論抗戰至何年何日、直至日本明瞭中國不能被征服以至中國從艱苦抗戰中獲得自由與更生然後休止、吾人深信最後勝利必屬于吾人、然吾人知正義與公道皆在吾人方面、吾人乃爲人類自由平等而抗戰、吾人爲我們的「大地」而抗戰、爲吾人之神聖家庭、爲吾人之富麗古物、爲吾人之和平進步、爲吾人之國家生存及獨立而抗戰更有進者、吾人此次抗戰之目的、乃爲文明人類而抗戰者也、吾人抵抗國際攫奪主義者之侵略、吾人抵抗國際安全之第一公×、吾人抵抗侵略之瘟疫及世界和平之侵擾者、吾人抵抗　武主義者、吾人抵抗民治及目决制度之×人、吾人抵抗『未經宣布的戰爭』之新狀熊如××、搶刦、　炸、未設防城市屠殺非戰鬥員、摧殘文化機關蔑視中立國家權益、侵犯中立國家主權、例如著名之巴納號艦事件等、吾人抵抗逞强爭霸之軍閱、彼等正幻發日本統治世界的「神聖使命」之迷夢其進犯中國、實爲企圖實現獨霸亞洲、控制太平洋及統治世界的迷夢之第一步、吾人抵抗野心的侵略國家、此等國家若能統制中國之人力及資源、當毫不猶豫的伸展其貪婪之手、以　取曲方國家在太平洋及亞洲大降之士地或更進而侵犯其邊境、吾人此次抗戰、固可謂不只爲我國本身、且爲貴國及世界而抗戰也、同時、吾人亦爲目前被軍壓迫之日本無辜平民及勞動羣衆而抗戰也、蓋吾人深信亞洲的正義之最後勝利、將給予日本民衆以自由、而不至在封建勢力下受苦、</p>
<p>我國民衆、懐此信念、在抵抗侵略戰爭中、雖作極悲壯之犧牲、仍感快慰、吾人並不灰心、反而以作此偉大犧牲爲榮、蓋吾人乃爲世界自由和平而抗戰者也、吾人堅持此目的繼續奮鬥、誠以缺乏和平與自由、生活　無目的、貴國之偉大愛國志士拍特立克亨利有實曰、予我自由或予我死亡、吾人固與之有同感也、</p>
<p>尤有進者、國際法律及公理之維護、固非一國之事、掩蔽眼睛、置世界事變於不理、固不能保護其權益、蓋此殆無異於駝鳥之埋首於沙中以謀躲避耳、強盜攻鄰戶之門、躲首於被中、固不能保障自己之安全也、鄰居失火、掩蔽窗門、不能保其室之不被波及也、美國之和平與安全、固不能與世界無關、欲求和平、當爲和平努力、欲求安全當付安全代價、</p>
<p>余請爲諸君吿者、日本之從事戰爭、實不能全自已、其進犯中國也、實有賴於其他國家、特別爲美國、供給其軍事材料及軍械、而爲購冒軍用品起見、又須脫售其產品、例如日本須購買貴國之廢鐵及棉花、但須將其生絲售與貴國有此關係、日本侵略者可被遏制焉同時美國人士亦有機會可恊助制止日本島國之野心只憑經濟力量、美國卽可戰勝日本、美國一旦增强其對日經濟制裁、日本之泥足、卽無法自拔、美國可不必參戰而制止日本之侵略、</p>
<p>今日慶祝美國宣布獨立犯念余提出國際陰威脅獨立宣言所列原則一點殊感歉仄、然以中國而論、事已大白、一切皆已安排、吾人在亞洲進行第三年之獨立戰爭、只引貴國祖宗之偉大犧牲以自勵、務求爭取自由平等、余引首遙瞻『世界和平人類親善』之日屆時太平洋之兩大共和國、當可紀念『民衆的、民衆主持的、爲民衆而設立的政府當不滅亡』之思想、而互相慶祝、</p>
<h3 id="c11">我的戰場觀　第×戰區前×總司令 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 羅卓英</p>
<p>民族抗×的神聖戰爭，恰屆兩週年。偉犬戰場的眞實體驗，令我越發深刻地感覺戰爭是毀滅，同時是創造，是淘汰，同時是淘　。</p>
<p>中國舊社會的封建殘型，和自私自利苟且偷安，散漫，懦弱的劣很性，</p>
<p>被無情的砲火毀滅了。然而另一方面，你會知道：在戰場中新創造出來的，却是宇宙人類最進步的模型，和生氣勃勃，有光，有熱，有力的新中國國魂。</p>
<p>在砲火聲中，當有不少體質尫柔，胆識不足。意志薄弱、甚而自甘墮落的人們，被怒濤般的戰血淘汰出去了。然而另一場合，你可知道有無教的新國民，尤其是熱誠的靑年，一批一批受着戰爭爐火的淘鍊，格外現得　實而活潑。勇敢而有爲，挺着胸脯，帶着笑容，走上戰場。保衛祖國。</p>
<p>我相信這是中華民族復興的象徵，是新中國創造的力量，亦卽是抗戰最後勝利的可靠保證。</p>
<p>因爲這個缘故，我常常對戰場發生三種的想象：</p>
<p>第一，我把戰場想像是一個「試驗場」，誰是有爲，誰是無爲或不爲，誰是能幹，誰是不能幹，誰是勇敢，誰是懦法；誰願求進取，接受淘錬誰又甘自暴自棄，聽令自然淘汰在戰場上是一個最好的考驗。</p>
<p>第二，我又把戰場想像是一所「學校」，一面用兵，一面練兵；一面打仗。一面硏究：一面工作，一面傳授；把火線和戰壕當作講堂，把戰鬥當日常功課，同時還準備把戰績來　造新中國的軍學。</p>
<p>第三，恰恰相反的，我復把戰場想像是一片『大海」。在這廣無珢，深無底，彼　起伏的大海裏，什麽都可以容納下去，我們必須把有限的×寇×兵，完全消滅在這大海壽，使它片甲不得囘去！</p>
<h3 id="c12">蝦蟆想食天鵝肉（中）　日軍誘脅我講和 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>「支那人民對前的　語，「倒」今的事實，怎麽樣呢？」</p>
<p>『　華北華中華南完全　于大日本手里，擬將黨府內益呈糾紛。結果大立物汪精衞赴上海亡命……』大立物究竟大到怎樣？恐怕連汪精衛自已也要發生疑問，何况是戰區的巷百姓。</p>
<p>又說什麽：「日華兩民，共是東亞司胞民族，誼使彼此握手，以爲實行親善。」其後還映着女明星的照片。一個個做出情不自勝的姿態；所謂學皇佈吿，不過如此而已！</p>
<p>傳單之另一變相</p>
<p>×人散些不倫不類的傳單，出些結結巴巴的佈吿。自知奸計難售。必　效力；於是又以某種「中國人」立場，臨時歸印此中小型的套色報紙，企圖魚目混珠，好向我戰區民衆又大肆欺騙。可是懷種子畢竟長不出好苗芽，滿紙歪曲理論，更像　瘋姑娘抹白粉，反更無情的增加了其　態。</p>
<p>例如有所謂『和平報』，由　『中國國民黨改組同志會』出版。第一版第一條紅字大標題，卽假造我國府如何如何改組的消息：『行政院長孫科，軍政部長×××，政治部長周恩來，軍政次長林彪。』除周恩來原任政治部副部長，誰也知道其餘全屬于虛。</p>
<p>次爲專論，登有汗逆精衛「致蔣介石先生公開信」，略謂「日本由用兵爭戰，已放棄侵略（？）」汪竟自必欺人，仍動蔣委員長快與日本謀和。</p>
<p>接着又是「汪兆銘發第三次聲明」，大意是辯護他主張同日講和，是千應萬該的，並反駁中央不應開除他的黨籍，尤其不應下令通緝。文中有「現在我（汪自稱）固然被一部份人說是秦檜」句，編者（日本人口氣）還在文末續上一個註解，略謂『秦檜是「隨」唐後南宋時代的人，那時的在百五十年（？）前，名傳天下的岳飛，信用他幷且仟爲宰相，後來又離開岳飛，獨與金人謀和，世人都非難他是姦臣，現在汪兆銘很和他相像，所以有一部份（豈止一部份）人罵他是漢奸。但是「人民諸君一要知道：結果岳飛反被秦檜給殺了。」乖乖　汪精　想殺今日之岳飛——無數量的民族英雄，好大的賣國本領，難道說出來不會感覺臉紅麽？</p>
<p>後揑造一通電，說李宗仁、陳誠、薛岳等是怎樣推崇汪精衛，曾聯名電請蔣委員長：『予汪以捲土秉來之活動機會』。其實李，陳，薛諸人，誰不知道他們是功業彪炳的抗日名將，尤其李將軍前與記者談及汪逆問題，×××××××××！所　推崇云云，縱去哄三歲小孩都不會相信的。</p>
<p>「和平報」的第二版叫「火箭」，有而短評說，「中國抗戰應在九一八時，自教沽協定，甚至武漢失陷，甚至日本屡次仲手想接受和平時，中國都應該大，方方投到它懷窩里去……」這簡直不成其爲話，接着，又捧起那雙早爲世人所不齒的臭小脚——一切漢奸理論，大而亂嚼。</p>
<p>第三版叫「南風」（南風是偷用雲南日報文藝版的名稱），却滿登着色情狂的文字，如將香港某小報的長篇誨淫小說，剪排一段在上面，可是並不說明是轉戰的。此外還挿上西洋妓女裸體照片，以及　　不堪入目的　圖。在牠們打的如意算盤，準是認爲這樣一來，就可以把我們的戰區軍民，麻醉得連槍都不會放了。殊不知秦晉民風古樸，最忌誨盜誨淫，×人去散佈這類豫慶圖文，徒然招致極端反感：新靑年則笑其手段卑汚，老年人則為其有傷風化而已。　（未完）</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦五日電】據此間外交訪員稱、莫斯科談判最近之阻滯、係由於蘇聯不願向荷蘭及瑞士兩國提出反侵略之保證、因該兩國刻尙未正式承認蘇聯政府也、唯英政府已再作讓步、接近蘇方之要求、以保證波羅的海各國、「每日快報」稱、最近英國已通知蘇聯、表示願意保證波羅的海各國、唯英法蘇三國協定必須加以擴大、包括保証荷蘭與瑞士、以及已經英法保証之國家、波蘭、羅馬尼亞、土耳其、希臘、比利時及葡萄牙、『新聞紀事報』稱、英蘇談判似已發生新困難、英方認爲如沿德邊境上各國、需加保証、則在他方邊境上各國、亦均應加以保証也、『每日　郵報』對英蘇談判事、亦其此類似意見、幷謂、政府方面及下院中人士、逐漸認爲蘇聯故意延滯、該項談判、以打擊張伯倫之地位、擁護玫府者前對英蘇協定、極爲關切、希望能早日成立、現亦因其無期展延、而感失望、若干國會議員更認爲、如英蘇協定有何價値、則亦將因曠時費日而减少矣、</p>
<p>（路透社倫敦五日電）據若干外交訪員之意見、莫斯科之談判、在擴大保證範圍方面、仍有困難、聞英國已接納蘇方之要求、對於三波羅的海國家、已願加以保證、唯要求蘇聯、英蘇協定亦須保證荷蘭及瑞士、泰晤士報今日評論稱、世上不應有任何國家、違背其意志、而加入保證制度、故英法蘇應迅速簽訂互助之條約、同時、英法更可運用外交、歡導波波羅的海各國、俾此等國家得悉、與三反侵略國家成立協約、實爲保障其眞正利益之最好方法也、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦四日電】據倫敦蘇聯人士稱、最近之英國提案已進一步迎合蘇聯點、刻各項問題未全澄淸、聞雙方對於波羅的海問題、已較接近、惟尙有若干點須再加闡釋云</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科四日電〕此間權戚方面人士、不信外傳英法蘇協定實際經已吿成、不日卽行簽字之說。雖談判進行甚佳、惟對於保證波羅的海岸各國問題是否已得解决、則尙無表現、消息靈通方面相信、莫洛托夫之覆文、包含有對提案需再加以討論、故談判尙需延長若干時云、</p>
<p>〔路透社倫效四日電〕路透社外交訪員、自消息靈通方面探悉、外傳英法蘇反侵略談判業已完成、未免言之渦早、該項談判原盼此時卽可成立協定、惟蘇聯之覆文所提若干點、顯需再行考慮、聞雙方正立卽、續談判其他事項、可望協定不致稽延云、</p>
<p>〔海通社倫敦四日電〕今日此間各報、均以保留之態、批評英蘇談判、大多數報紙僅提出報吿謂、英最駐蘇大使及英特使史德隆曾再與外長莫洛托夫會談、此間若干政界方面人士、對於蘇聯報界並未批評評近英法提案、認爲係一「有希望之象徵」云、</p>

<p>【本港外訊】東京談判、自英日雙方提出要求後、消息靈通界人士認爲、該項談判或將吿于流產、據日方之同盟社稱、英國當局經通知日方謂、英國談判之先决條件、爲日方停止封鎖英租界、另一方面、日方却要求應將英和界內華資銀行之存銀五千萬元移交日方後、再開始談判、故一般認爲、談判或將因有此南轅北轍之兩歧點而擱淺、在目前欲天津日軍、和綏其對英租界之封鎖、實屬渺茫、事實上、上星期六後已加緊、東京相信、英當局將拒絕移交中國存銀、若干方面宣稱、事實上存銀經已自天津英租界移至一英艦之上</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦五日電】據各報載稱、日軍當局現正「反覆推求各種方法、以獲得英國援助華北日幣及默許日本侵華之行動」、泰晤士報外交訪員引述上項報吿後稱「如日方提出此點、則東京談判將無若何進展、英政府已準備向日本保證天津租界之中立地位、並於證實犯罪時、將四華籍嫌疑犯、引渡日方、但除此以外、英國决不能隨意接受任何要求也」、</p>

<h3 id="c21">歐洲和戰的關鍵 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 世長</p>
<p>今日歐洲各國，積極備戰，雖然，在表面上，太平無事，但內在的緊張情形，是誰都知道的，據最近各通訊社發出的消息，德國軍隊和軍火，由東普魯士紛紛運往但澤，納粹黨人圖在但澤組織義勇隊，但澤局勢已到了十分危急的地步，這些報道雖經德國官方否認，但是，這不會空穴來風的，目前的歐洲，到處充滿火藥氣息，但，事實上並沒有戰爭，法國著名政論家奥曼森氏最近評述歐洲局勢，非常得當；他說：『我們現在：活於一奇怪的時代中，旣非戰時，也無和平，沒有和平，因爲軸心國家的活動，已迫使歐洲大多數的國家在一種半動員的狀態中，而千百萬人民更因此而感覺驚駭，沒有戰爭，因爲，一切危機尙未達到不可挽救的地步，而事實上，的確還沒有發生戰事』。</p>
<p>歐洲目前的局勢，是在戰爭與和平之間，在這種狀態之下，除了眞正發生戰爭外。一切武噐均已準備完整；陸海軍已有一都動員，以防事變：宣傳的機構，更是異常活躍。實際上，現在還未有正式的軍隊衝突，但是，心理上的戰事，是隨時存在的</p>
<p>德國曾經一再聲霄不願戰爭，這，在一般不很熟悉歐局者的眼光中，必是良好的現象，和平的救星，但是，內在的實情，並不那麽簡單，德國的目的，想要再來好幾次「慕尼黑」，不用戰爭，而滿足理想中的慾望</p>
<p>德人現集中所有力量，對付他們心目中的敵對集團，他們相信波蘭的財力，决不能無期的維待百萬大軍，而英法最後也必不願在東歐戰爭。但是，在另一方面，法國已經實行永久性的局部動員，英國採取了徵兵制，英法海軍在地中海有了密切的合作，這些都是世界政治棋局中的妙拱，不可加以忽視。</p>
<p>現在歐局好像正在進行中的棋賽，雙方勢均力敵，都能支持，所以，還不致有大變，但是，長期的樂觀，恐怕不易辦到。目前的過渡狀態，是不能永久維持的。</p>
<p>今日的情形，雖很緊張，但，並不像一九一四年，人類的浩刦，尙有挽囘的機會，集樣和民主兩大集團都願意延長目前非戰百和的備戰時期，因爲，戰爭是一種極大的冒險，張伯倫初達拉第，對於這點。認識得太淸楚，而一再後　，犧牲小國，提髙了侵略者的氣燄；但，希特勒和莫索里尼，對於戰爭的危險，何學不知？</p>
<p>我們對於德國今後的行動，可有一個合理的假設：如果德國相信進攻波蘭，將引起隊洲的大戰，那末，它就不會攻擊波蘭，至少它也得等待更有利的時機，再行下手，希特勒並不是笨伯，他將選擇抵抗較少的方向進行，很可能的，德國行將達取西班牙，匈牙利，或南斯拉夫。</p>
<p>總之，目前料局固極緊急　暫時可無引經大戰之虞，眞正的戰爭危險在於一方對於他方的實力和决心，有了錯誤的估計；同時，更以爲對方在國力（包括軍備，商業，財政，經濟，工業各項）統賽中，進展極速若再照樣繼續下去，定必强大無比，不可侵犯，所以，與其將來不，不如目前一戰，這是戰禍危險之所在，也就是歐洲和戰的關　。（本文取材自六月廿九日本港德臣西報）。</p>

<h3 id="c22">國際同情 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>英國援華運動會，主持的『中國週』，將于「七七」兩周年紀念日舉行。美國的中國週　，則已于前日開始。而蘇聯的列寗格勒，則正熱烈籌備大規模中國藝術展覽會。</p>
<p>這種運動之熱烈展開，適當此中華民族偉大抗戰兩週年紀念之際，一面足以證明我國堅持抗戰兩年，在國際的地位日益增髙，國際對我之同情援助日益廣大；另一面又足以警吿那些在日×漢奸汪逆　『反共和平』陰謀活動下開始動搖的份子，足以大大提髙我們全民族的自尊心與自信心。</p>
<p>我們在今日，一方面要緊抓住這個國際優勢，加緊政府的和國民的外交工作，推進更壯大更有力的援華運動，强化反抗侵略的民主和平陣線，另一方面，更須加緊努力，打擊和肅淸汪逆及其一羣的漢奸賣國的言論行動，加强全民族的統一團結，力爭及至持主動的全面的持久戰爭取最後勝利，在全世界人士面前表現出中華民族。决不是日×漢奸所能統治，表現出中華民族不愧爲自己而且不愧爲世男正義和平的中堅勢力。</p>

<h3 id="c23">空中炸蘭　永別了！飛機與炸彈 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>不久以前，大史　韋爾斯，在「新聞紀事報」上，寫了一篇「飛機炸彈無用論」；說起了最新發明的空中炸藥的威能。</p>
<p>吿訴你，我就是空中炸藥的發明人，可是，我命運不好，幾次找國防調整部大臣，要求准許公開試騐，都遭拒絕了。因此，我發明了已經一年，始終還不曾出頭。</p>
<p>但是，我絕不灰心。我相信，終有一天，我的空中炸藥，會在戰場大出風頭。現在，我且來作一點自我宣傳，但，說的話，句句是實。</p>
<p>我的空中炸彈，構造異常簡單，一個輕氣球，一個小炸彈，一根火藥線，一支爆炸絲，及一　指針，一共只要五個先令的成本。</p>
<p>一個不太大的輕氣球，把這四件小東西，帶釗天空上去，在空際自由自在的飄蕩。，炸的方式，有兩種，如果×人的飛機，來碰上了，自然一下子同歸於盡。另外，你可以把指針配定爆炸的時間，大約可以一小時到廿四小時不等。到了你指定的時候，爆炸絲先炸了，火藥線點着了，炸彈炸開了。一切都是自動，不勞你多費手脚。</p>
<p>自然，一下子，不見得就剛巧碰上了×人的飛機，但是，你只要放上一百個，在你頭頂上打圈圈，×人的飛機，還敢進來嗎？</p>
<p>譬如，拿倫敦來說吧！如果，×人的飛機，自歐洲來攻擊，我們只要知道它們已在渡英吉利海峽的時候，便可以開始把輕氣球一個個　上去了。</p>
<p>最好是風平浪靜，或者是有點西風。輕氣球昇到空中，慢慢地隨着微風，向東面迎上去。等到×人飛機駕駛員看見了，那已來不及躲避啦！漫山倒海地，源源而來，準把×人全炸個粉碎，結果，比日本的神話宣傳，還要神話萬倍。</p>
<p>你也許見到，輕氣球這樣一個一個放上去，多慢呀！沒有的事，兩個普通的生手，一分鐘可以放上去兩隻氣球，只要半個鐘頭，四千人，便能放上去十二萬隻哪氣球。</p>
<p>輕氣球的上昇，也異常快，普通三十分鐘，可以　到三萬尺，自然，上昇的速度，是由氣的容量來决定的。並且你還可以規定氣球的重量，使他可以停留在一定高度的空間，飄　到整整廿四小時。</p>
<p>刮大風的時候，自然，稍爲比較討厭，但也沒有多大關係，氣球一樣昇的飛快炸開，只要放的地位，反風向倒移一稈，那麼等大風把炸彈吹射這地方，炸得正　勁。</p>
<p>你也許會想到，天空中一大堆炸彈，裂開了，碎鐵不都打在下面的人的腦袋上了嗎，這，在髙射炮彈上，的確有這樣的毛病，現在，都一點兒也沒　，所有的炸彈，都是輕輕的鐵片做成的，炸了之後，都粉碎了，飄到地下，一點份　也沒有啦！你請千萬放心，頭上不戴帽子，也决不事。</p>
<p>自然，最怕的，還是風向。譬如說，氣球剛放上去不久。西風突然復東風了。那就糟啦。所有炸藥，都要囘自已陳里來了。但是，這不過說說吧了到底，風是不會一時三刻，幻變多端的，而且，最精的氣象測驗，是可以預測到　二小時內的風向，那還怕什麽。</p>
<p>再說吧，氣球眞的會退到自已頭上，那也沒有關係反正我們自已不用飛機，儘管先在天上炸開好了，還可以看一場好火花呢！</p>
<p>說了許多，空中炸藥最好以地方；還不曾說；那便是人力的節省。飛行員，高射炮手，都省了，救下了多少人的生命啊！</p>
<p>輕氣球在下面放，多保險的工作，而且，手續簡便，人人皆會，工廠里製空中炸藥，也比造驅逐機，高射炮容易得多了。</p>
<p>好了，你該完全明白了嗎？吿訴你，終有一天，像韋爾斯先生說的；世界上飛機要絕跡的；看我的空中炸藥來大出風頭。</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員什爾，趁德輪去遊歴歐洲。因爲英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便在逃起來。好容易地逃出虎口，回到美境。傑克與日爾便囘紐的去，見到邱。邱又叫他們趁『聖瑪克號一去歐洲找他的兒子。在艦上，傑克不肯替一個名叫强生的人發封密碼電報，原來那條伙就是叫拉維基的德國問…</p>
<p>十二　放他一次</p>
<p>第二天早上，傑克和比爾出來看時，一些旅客們，頗有些騷動；不遠的海面上，看得出，有一條大船，很快的，向西推近來。等她近來點，就看淸了，她是一艘，有四個烟鹵的大船，烟通上漆得烏黑，也沒有任何顏色鑲條，船身上半截，是　黄色，下半截，是　色。</p>
<p>許多的推測，臆斷，但是，立刻就分明了。這是，以前的一璐泰尼號一，現在，在戰期中，被英國政府，改成了一艘兵艦，這，看她在前後甲板上，安置的炮座，就知道了。</p>
<p>當她近來的時候，從　那種呆滯，陰鬱的漆飾上，充分　出一股獰猙，嚴肅的神氣。</p>
<p>『停船！』</p>
<p>在她船頭上，　着旗語，無觀電里，也來了同樣的命令。</p>
<p>『聖　克號』，二次的，又將機器緩慢下來，終於，兩艘大船，在　波揚浪的海面上，對立着，輕輕的顚播，似乎在點着頭，『各泰尼號一理放下來的小船，也就搖搖暹擺的晃過來了。</p>
<p>「現在，是你的機會來啦去吿發老煨鷄吧。一比爾提醒着傑克　他們正倚在無綫電室的門口看着</p>
<p>「我又覺得，這種舉動，似乎很卑鄙的，「傑克想了一會兒。「當『路泰尼號』一停下來，我就想着了，但是——唉，算啦，我想還是放鬆他一次』。</p>
<p>『也許，過去之後，你又要懊悔呢。』，比爾說。他這話，有點近於是一句預言。</p>
<p>『璐泰尼號一上來的官員檢査的並不挺利害，因爲一聖瑪克號』已經經過『勃維克號』的檢査了。德國人旣已　提走了，現在，所做的，只要視察一下船牌，就算了。沒有多久工夫。不到半個鐘頭，兩條船致過敬禮，又分開了。</p>
<p>這天下午。傑克的無綫電室里，到了一位貴賓，就是强生先生。他曲意謟嵋開始這次談話。</p>
<p>『昨天下午，我恐怕是太暴燥了。』他說，『我特來道歉。』</p>
<p>『這就行了。』傑克一副不願多談的神氣，他想打消强生先生的企圖。</p>
<p>「我——恩——或者，我送得數目太少了，」他却連下去「現在，我可以應許你，若是，你肯替我發出一封電訊，—當然，用密碼。我司以應昨天的欵數，加倍送你」</p>

<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>看過了本報『新舊體操比較觀』一文的，大約對於「新體操」都可以得到了一些概念，不過因爲該文是把『新體操』來和『舊體操』作一個比較，對於它的動作和操法，僅僅叙述丁一個梗槪，未曾行過這種體操的，或評會發生一新體操』究竟有些什麽動作和操法究竟是怎樣的疑問？希望有一個較詳盡的叙述。所以更有此篇之作。</p>
<p>在沒有寫動作和據法之前，有必須聲明的事項，先寫出來：</p>
<p>這些動作和操法，雖然是根據中大吳仲歐先生的；但多少參加了筆者的意見，問或和吳先生的意見稍有出入。不過不會差得太遠。</p>
<p>『新禮操』是鎔化歐美新舊體操等動作而成的，它包含「活潑」「動多」「量大」「效大」等原則。「舊體操的動作，倘不背這些原則，它是一體操用的。還裏叙述的，僅僅是它和舊體操不同的動作。</p>
<p>爲了節省篇幅、同　中各種動作的操法、倘說明一種就可以概其餘的、就只說明一種、餘下的單舉名稱；必須逐一證明方可明瞭的，才一一說明。</p>
<p>『新體操』必定先有部位、然後動作。下肢的部位、除了下肢運動以外、倘不特別指明用其他部位的、都是用半開立式的部位、</p>
<p>肌肉的調節、新體操很重視、爲的是防止肌肉流於呆板和僵硬。多數動作、肌肉有緊　、必有鬆弛、譬如：『擺』的動作、擺時緊是漲、擺到了一定部位後就　弛；『打』的動作、打時是緊漲、收同時就鬆弛：其餘都是這樣。有種動作如『振』、因爲過於快速而用力。在動作時得不到鬆弛肌肉的機會、則在一節體操完畢後、可加入放鬆運動。</p>
<p>這篇文字倘能和「新舊體操比較觀」一文對照着看、對於「新體操」的操法、必定格外容易明瞭。</p>
<p>動作遺漏的、一定很多、希望以後有補充的機會、子、「擺」的動作、這是新體錄中上肢運動最主要之一、以活潑自然爲主、每次擺動、中段的動作、必須迅速、使肌肉緊漲、擺至一定部位時、須緩和、使肌肉鬆她、下肢可隨上收擺動之勢自由屈伸或點起、</p>
<p>（一）分開左右擺——兩臂由身前交叉之部位、分開左右擺、至一定部位時、再擺囘全身前交叉、尙有「分開左右後擺」、與這個動作相仿、惟按囘時在陶前交叉、兩手各攀對方之肩背、擺出時向下後方、</p>
<p>（二）同方左右擺——兩臂由同時、舉或右舉的部位、同時向右擺或左動、講至左方時、右足可點起、右方時左足可點起、</p>
<p>（三）前後——兩臂由下垂部位、向前後擺動、每擺一次、膝可屈伸一次、可分兩　同時擺和交亙—一前一後！擺兩種、</p>
<p>（四　分開「8　字形擺——兩臂由胸前交叉之部位、分開向下後上側上擺至頭上交叉、隨卽回至胸前、分開各法冉擺、左右臂各在身之前側劃」「8　宇形、每擺一次、交叉時須換一臂在前、</p>

<p>— 谷斯範</p>
<p>一天在我朋友琪的間壁，搬來了兩個女孩子，大的一個態度溫淑莊重，小的一個留着前劉海，活潑有趣，她們把門板塔成床鋪，被單四周圍着作帳子，地板上用稻草鋪地，是她們的朋友一個風度很雅緻的美少年的床位，他們都是浙江靑年戰時工作團的同學，兩個女的由省會派到浙　邊境的於潛縣來，男的送她們到此地，逗留一二天，便準備到蘇常一帶去，他是新四軍的淪陷區情報員。</p>
<p>他們愛笑愛閙愛唱歌，簡直沒有停歇的時候，閙了一個晚上，但第後天一淸早，又不知溜到什麽地方去玩了，我們起身的時候，外面靜得什麽似的，走過他的房間，但見滿地　是草屑，花生壳，還零亂地丟　幾本書：『大衆哲學』『生死場』『文藝陣地』。琪的夫人笑着說：</p>
<p>『這像關什　樣兒？』</p>
<p>『狗窠；』我開玩笑地囘答。</p>
<p>琪記起什麽似的說：</p>
<p>那小的一個像露露，一樣的前劉海和活潑，單聽她的杭州音，也會使人想起小時候的露露。』</p>
<p>『爲什麼我並不這樣想？』我說，</p>
<p>因爲你在上海遇見她的時候，她已經大了。』</p>
<p>是的，那時候，已做了許多孩子的先生，而且我們沒有見了幾次面就分別，到現在算來已快三年。去年秋天，我從上海去長沙，途經金華，才知道她結了婚，從結婚照上意外地看到她的丈夫也是我的朋友，五前年我在上海北四川路一個中學唸書的時候，他是學校裏的敎務員，後來和一個小豐部女敎師的戀愛破裂，離開學校，誰也不知道他已飄流到那裏去了。</p>
<p>今年春天，又經金華，朋友們說起他們結婚不久就別離，露露進了新四軍的敎道營，她的丈夫加入了江南的游擊隊，但現在，露　快畢業了，而他已死在一次敵人圍攻裏。她寫信給金華的朋友。</p>
<p>『我不相信這是眞的，難道這果然是眞的嗎？……給我勇氣生活下去：……』</p>
<p>我把這事情吿訴琪，琪也寫了一封信安慰她：</p>
<p>『聽說你爲你的不幸而悲哀，我感到需要爲你寫信，因爲我是你的老友之一，你的悲哀不久會克服，像其他的人經歷着同一的變故一樣。人一來有熱情，也有理智，會激動，也會鎭靜，何况在你的面前，還擺着偉大的工作呢！』</p>
<p>但我相信，露露會在苦的不相識的鄰舍，像露露的人，這樣嬌養慣的姐小，也能够離開了淪亡的家　穿着軍用棉大衣，奔波於陌生的地方。</p>
<p>我不久就離開了於潛。</p>
<p>離於潛的前夜，我們喝了過多的酒，熄了燈，但誰也睡不去。琪很　奮，背着杜甫的『明日隔山岳，世事兩茫茫』的詩句。</p>
<p>『你什麼時候再來呢？』琪的夫人問。</p>
<p>『浙贛路不斷的話，過半年就會來。我回答。</p>
<p>『你不要信他！』琪狂喊着：『廣西離此地有三千里！而且即使他來。我們還會在於潛嗎？那時我們早已不知　　到那裏去了！』</p>
<p>誰也不再說話。窗外，月光下　着憂　的山谷。</p>
<p>外面，他們又鬧起來了，兩個女的笑着，男的髙聲叫『我的大女兒：我的小女兒！』</p>
<p>琪的夫人也忍不住笑起來，說：</p>
<p>『父們聽！怎樣的』位寶貝　爸呀！』</p>
<p>笑聲才了，他們又唱起了悲壯的『別離歌』最後的兩句：</p>
<p>別了，別了，同學們！</p>
<p>我們再見在前綫！是很容易催人眼淚的。</p>
<p>第二天早晨外面又靜得沒有一點聲昔，但當我們走過那問房子時，情形完全異樣：地掃得很乾凈，稻草地鋪也不見，他已經走了。</p>

<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>序曲</p>
<p>寂寥敎會了人思索，孤獨使人多想像。夜深沉，聽滴答的鐘聲，遂隨手記下這些零碎的感想。</p>
<p>時間</p>
<p>首先我想到了時間。多不易把捉的問　呵！（它從那裏面來，又往那裏而去呢？）一位唯美主　者說：『時間剝奪着你靑春的玫瑰。』又有人說：『別上什麼鐘鏢店，聽你的靑春被蠶食。』於是，在時間的面前人們駭怕得發抖了。担心紅顏變成白髮。</p>
<p>『秒鐘有多少個可能呢？』誰知道了我並不期求一個神秘的答案，說什麽有隻冥冥之手牽着命運的綱，朋友，細心點，你將　異時間替人帶來的變化。太多太多了。</p>
<p>在我們記憶中的孩子，已懂得了愛情：活潑的人已走進墳墓了。你瞧我們的祖國吧！他是如何的在與時間競　中超過了它，而飛速地進步呢？</p>
<p>對了。這正是我所要說的。不要駭怕，更別發抖。抓住它，完成我們該幹的工作。</p>
<p>幸福</p>
<p>『幸福有時離人很近，甚至一仲手就可觸到，而人們還是喪失了它。』我久久不能忘記這句話。幸福常彷徨於原野，　找不到顧主。</p>
<p>我又常記起哄堂大笑中被捉弄者尷尬面孔。人們慣於把自己的快樂建築在別人的　苦上，說是得到了幸福。但可憐，答案是否定的。</p>
<p>幸福不是自私的。而在這動亂的時代裏，早就沒有了個人的幸福，一切都依附於民族。舍本而逐未，爲一己努力是不會成功的。</p>
<p>幸福將落在祖國的兒女的身上。</p>

<p>月的光照像冷霜，</p>
<p>撒蓋在刁斗的營帳上。</p>
<p>在鐵盔的相撞聲中，</p>

<p>—還是一個女孩子的故事—</p>
<p>人們都站起來，檢取自已的什物，她們原來是沒有什麽的，就從　窻罙出身子去，張望有沒有來迎接的人。果然在雜沓的人羣中，她們看見有一方白旗上寫着歡迎××二位同志，』她們急速地向那邊搖着手，好像那邊的人也看到了，朝着她們這擠過來。正在這時候，突然響起一種奇怪的笛聲，立刻，人們像整個被攪翻了，婦人們，用尖厲的聲昔叫着，孩子們被擠得哭起來，那方白旗也渝沒下去了。人羣像被弄瘋了的　物，突　着，衝撞着，沒有秩序，也沒有理性。有的人被擠到月台下面，就是連維持次序的鐵路警察，也張惶地跑開。</p>
<p>她們簡直呆了，還是那個靑年人，恰巧他也沒有下去，吿訴她們這就是警報，領着她們從車後面洮下去。</p>
<p>不能等在這裏，車站是目標，我們趕快跑開去。』</p>
<p>他頭一僩跳到下面，靜聞也隨着跳下去，當她跳的時候，車動了一下，她就跌到地上。可是她很快就爬起來。隨着向鐵軌的外面跑去。</p>
<p>列車被瘋狂的機車拖走了。留下整個瘋狂的站台。人們一齊都朝門外擠，就都塞在柵門那裏。揮着紅旗的站員。吹着銅笛；可是沒有一點用。人羣中有的看見他們了呼嘯着，跑過來，立時，就有許多人跟隨，他們都朝田野跑去。</p>
<p>還沒有等他們跑開多少遠，突然警笛聲又響起來，那和先前的，不同短促而念驟地叫着，好像喘不過一口氣似的。那個靑年人就向她們說：</p>
<p>『不能再跑好遠了，大家散開，躺到地上。』</p>
<p>青焉聽從他的話，又跑了七八步，就臥到地上；可是那個靑年人像命令似地吩咐着：</p>
<p>『不要那樣，要仰臥，兩雙手平放在頭下。』（未完）</p>

<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事——</p>
<p>由於錢呵森的通知　打麥場上一一時忙了起來。錢阿森說，昨夜李金根吿訴他的「他們一在今天下鄉「搜索」要走過此地。</p>
<p>王明原對長領着我們正在幫着老奶奶家裏打麥，聽見了消息，就召集我們商議應付之策。爲「他們」的數目很多，有八九十　，於是我們按着習慣决定不和「他們」作正面衝突，暫時散到後面的秦山上去。</p>
<p>『好的』，老奶奶撩着額頭的汗說，『你們去，這裏一切看我。等他們來了去了，你們就可以下山囘來了。』</p>
<p>『我們怎能知道』他們』的來去呢？』王隊長問。</p>
<p>『你們只要看見此地場上有烟起來，便是『他們』來：烟息。便是『他們』去。』她又對她的兒子和媳婦說，『你們也去，只要阿明陪我就了。』阿明是她的孫子。</p>
<p>在王隊長督率我們在屋子裏收拾的時候，老奶奶的一家生錢阿森都在將場上的麥殺和斷麥桿畚到場的西南角上去，堆了起來。</p>
<p>我們上山去，錢阿森也囘靑鎭去，場上就剩了老奶奶和阿明兩個人。</p>
<p>我們在山脚上放步哨，大部份的人則掩藏在山腰的樹林裏，大家都端正好了傢伙，準備『他們』衝上來。</p>
<p>李金根在離開王家村沒有多遠的地方，就碰到了『他們』，給『他們』盤問。搜索，並毆打之後，總算沒有別的意外。</p>
<p>老奶奶看見『他們』漸漸走入村中，就去將麥殼堆點着了火　由他燃燒起來。</p>
<p>似乎『他們』裏面有人發着命令，對於這一佃小小的村落，也要盡盡『他們』所以下鄉的責任，於是有一小部份人進入　子去『搜索』，大部份人便在樹下坐下來歇着。</p>
<p>『喂，老婆子，』『他們』裏面一個穿着白布短衫褲的人喊着老奶奶，『你過來，我要問你。』</p>
<p>老奶手裏拖着一柄連柳，走了過去，阿明跟在她的後面，他們都顯着坦然的樣子，便是有人進入他們的屋子，似乎也不傾得他們的注意。</p>
<p>『什麼事？』老奶奶將衣角揩着汗。</p>
<p>『你們這裏可有尤吉隊？』</p>
<p>『「油　豆」家家會炒的。』</p>
<p>『不是什麽『豆』。問你這裏可有『土匪』』</p>
<p>『這裏從來沒有上匪，只有外面來的强盜。』</p>
<p>『强盜在那裏？』</p>
<p>『他們並不住在這裏，一來就去的。』</p>
<p>『他們搶些什麽』。</p>
<p>『看見什麼就什麽，連人也要的』。</p>
<p>她和那人胡扯了一陣。看看沒有什麽事，就又去打麥。</p>
<p>進　子去搜査』的人沒有出來，又跟了幾個人進去。那個穿白布　褲的人，似乎有些　聊便立了起來張望着，一眼看見了在燃燒着的麥殼堆，就又喊着奶奶說：</p>
<p>『喂老婆子，你過來，我還要問你。』</p>
<p>老奶奶只作不聽見，不理他。</p>
<p>『喂，老婆子，那裏燒些什麽呢？』他走啊過去，神氣似乎和善些。</p>
<p>老奶奶人聲說：『那裏燒的赤鏈蛇！』</p>
<p>『鏈蛇了那　來的赤鏈蛇？』分明要找些話說說。</p>
<p>『不曉得什麽地方來的赤鏈蛇！』老奶　拄下了連枷說。『可是總不是本地的的，因爲本地素來沒有，近來才發見的。』</p>
<p>『大麽？』　然和一般人那樣，都很　歡談蛇。</p>
<p>『怎麼不大；大的像臂膊，小的像指頭。』</p>
<p>『多麽？』</p>
<p>『怎麽不多；多時幾十條，少時一二條，時常有得來。據說有的地方還整千整千的發見呢！』</p>
<p>『有沒有人被咬死？』</p>

<p>一點多鐘的車程、把人從繁閙的市區　送到郊外、送到粉嶺去了、下了車沿着兩　田疇夾峙　的柏池路走七月裏的米田、掛着纍纍的谷米、一片嫩黃、講着綠樹野花、交織成一幅天然的美景、走不多遠、便看見了那個雄偉而仗岸立在一旁的復旦中學的英姿了、</p>
<p>校門外、髙竪着鮮明而瑰麗的國旗、迎風招展、這正襯托出學校里的同學心中的喜悅、過齊集、唱國歌、於是這一幕畢業禮便展開、校長對這羣畢業的同學諄諄訓勉、繼續由髙初二年級的同學代表、致歡送詞、末由畢業生答詞、繼着晚間還有游藝大會、公演話劇「歷程」助興、歡迎來賓參觀、</p>
<p>記者在展覽會闕還未有開幕之前、先分別的巡視這些學生心血的結晶、地方長的斗室、四壁整齊地列着學生史地的成續、其餘圖書館、動植物標本室、理化儀器室、解剖室都排列着很豐富的器物、這些器物、很多都是李泰初先生從美國買來、而從廣州搶救出來的、</p>
<p>在該校校園的凉亭裏、和學校　的負責人、談起他們苦心經營的情况、學校裏環境的優美、和設備種種、實在是一個非常完美的中學校。</p>
<p>在那邊念書的、百分之九十九是筍宿生、所收費用、髙中男女生全學期祗收港幣一百一十元、初中男女生則收港幣一百元、這些收費、和香港原有的學校相比、幷不算髙貴的、</p>

<p>目前上海電台之多、實開未有之新紀元、但泰半係國軍西撤後、交通部國際電信局無形解散、乃紛紛設立者、計有二十餘家之多、往日在無線電中播特別節目、頗能引起百萬聽衆興趣今則除慈善節目外、客家之播送特必節目者、往往四五天有一次、所播之節目無非滑稽申曲彈詞等、恐日久以後、聽衆將欲厭棄矣、蓋所謂特別範目當然要特別、今播來播去是老調、不能稱特別也明矣、</p>
<p>電台之播送特別節目、往往播固定節目之客家受其損失、但亦有幾家電台情願照補日子於客家、但亦屬少數耳、故客家甯願出較貴之電費、不假座播特別節目之電台播送節目、實有因也、</p>
<p>播送特別節目之電台泰半係八一三以後新設立者居多、其餘老電台除大陸電台泰半係慈善特別節目爲難民呼援、間或有一二以商業官傳者亦有之、華東電合則除慈善節目外、拒不播送特別節目、故頗受固定客家及聽長　目之聽衆所歡迎、國華電台則特別節目較多、另有聽衆、</p>

<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>較歷史上任何時期爲多　一囚犯爲戒煙故意犯罪入獄</p>
<p>華德路監牢—這世界最大的監獄、又打破紀錄了、現在裏面的囚犯總數、不下七三七七人、比較它歷史上任何時期的囚犯爲多、五年來、這監獄裏的囚犯不出七千人、戰時、它的總數確實減低到四六七四人、但過去幾月來、囚犯激增、不多幾天以前、又達到七千人的數宇、並且看來繼續有增漲的趨勢、</p>
<p>華德路監牢很有名、所居的囚犯也稠密、有很少數的囚犯、犯了微少的罪行、爲的是要到裏面去住上數星期、上星期有一椿案件、一個囚犯認他是故意入獄的、原來這人有鴉片　、感到痛苦要戒絕而不能、他的朋友們吿訴他犯些小罪、押進華德路監獄、保證他的確可戒絕毒癮、因此、這人便偷些東西、被判處徒刑三個月、現在他正在戒烟、據監員說、他可戒除烟　的、</p>
<p>一九三二年正月、華德路監獄裏有六七四五個囚犯、都是華人、外藉囚犯不在其內、因爲他們在厦門路西牢裏、但幾個月之內、華德路監牢達到它歷史上任何時的最髙囚犯人數、計有七二五一人、其後雖有多多波動、但已減低、有的已赦出、或是附有條件地開釋、歲月如流、一九三七年的戰事到來了、戰時、釋出的囚犯很多、原來還要開釋更多的囚犯、但這個計畫停止了、炮彈擊中監獄、曾擊死幾個犯人、押進去的囚犯比較的少、所惟人數劇跌到四六七四人、這是十月聞、戰事快移開上海區時候的事、</p>
<p>然後、人數又開始逐漸增髙、但據數字看來、不致再到以前的髙水準、自一九三二年、這監牢已擴大、添設外籍囚犯部份、替代厦鬥路的西牢、現在的華人囚犯七一四〇人、雖比以前的最髙紀錄要少、但連外籍囚犯一一一人、和感化院裏的一二六人總計起來、有七三七七人、已是這監牢歷史上的最髙囚犯紀錄了、</p>
<p>這種情形、不是始料所及的、本年初、牢裏的華人共有六三一二人、監牢常局根據可能的罪案增加而估計本年襄的囚犯最多不出七千人、但現在已知道估計錯誤了、因爲罪案增加（這在工部局的警務和訴訟報吿上可見到）結果監牢裏的囚犯數超出實料、自本年三月份起、繼續增加、沒有間斷、只是每星期秒開釋囚犯、而沒有押入的、人數方始減少些</p>
<p>現在的囚犯總數裏、包括有已處死刑、在等着處决的囚犯二十五人、無期徒刑的七十九人、徒刑十五年以上的二百人、十年以上的五六三人。七年以上的九〇二人二五年以上的七六一人、三年以上的六八二人二年以上的五二四人、一年以上的、八八六人、半年以上的一二〇七人、三月以上的八二八人、二月以上的一六七人、一月以上的一四六人、七天以上的一六九人、還有一個囚犯、沒有判决、</p>
<h3 id="c65">呢絨業的內銷 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>上海無疑地在我們全國中、是個商業中心區、無論是出口或是進口、大都經過了這裏後、大批地把我們的國產原料貨品等、運向外洋去、或是打從外洋去、或是打從外洋定下了大批的貨品、然後再運錧到國內其他商埠去、所以我們說上海的商業、也就是我們全國工商業的樞綫、那該是不錯的、</p>
<p>呢絨業在上海、自然也該算是我們全國呢絨業的樞紐區了、在幾十年來上海呢絨業的行銷狀况上看、就可得到證明、在路去、多數的呢絨行號、不僅是供應了時市的消費者的需要、他同本調節了國內其他許多商埠的需求、因此在好些呢絨行號的全年營業數字中、外埠的交易、要佔其一半、當着交通與運輸方面便利的時候、並曾超過這個比例的、行銷的區域、在華北有北平、天津、靑島、大連、煙台、濟南、等等、九一八前、遼甯如瀋陽、營口等處、也有走銷的、在華中華南方面、更是廣闊異常、諸如漢口、長沙、南京、蘇州、抗州、桂林、南昌、廣州、汕頭等處、每年交易都稱忙碌、如天津、北平、靑島、漢口等地、每年銷行尤巨、一一二八一的戰爭二、曾給予了外埠的走銷方面以很大的打擊、那時不僅僅以呢絨業爲然、其他如五金棉紗等等二又何嘗不遭遇了相同的境况、但那時因爲戰事不久就吿結來、所以不久後、呢絨業和其他的行衆一般、仍恢復了外埠的行銷、在情况上、倒也不會怎樣的低落、</p>
<p>但終於「八一二　全面抗戰、突在上海爆發了、當時呢絨業正是個冬的生意季節、平津雖已在緊張的狀態中、但如靑漢的客人、正紛紛蒞臨配貨、至此又不得不暫停進貨、跟着戰事的激烈進展、於九月初、呢絨業連本市的走銷、也陷於停頓了、店員等亦有很多避戰返鄉、迨至十二月初、國軍撤離上海、呢絨業和其他業號一般、也才開始營業、外埠的行切斷、這時乃吿絕　、而　局亦有很多處所、運輸不通、本市的銷行、也淸淡異常、在這一個時期中、呢絨業只可說是在維持着店面、大家是在驚魂甫定之後、整理其業務、</p>
<p>後一年、平津靑等處的津浦綫郵端恢復了、華北方面、才時常有些配貨、但不再像戰前有那麽成疋成箱的銷了、只是幾碼幾套等等而已不過當時漢口武昌等處的行銷、突轉活躍、這是因爲我們的全面戰爭已擴展至長江內圍綫去了、才造成了武漢的畸形繁榮局面、上海的呢絨行號、有好些曾派人由帘波温州轉道到武漢去「坐莊」、儘量供應春夏貨品、因此呢絨業在這時的內銷方面、幾已成爲一面倒——武漢方面去了、</p>
<p>但終於在夏盡時節　武漢又吿失陷了、武漢的走銷才又絕跡、</p>
<p>從此呢絨的內銷、才成爲滯頓的狀態中、現在華北的郵運、差不多都吿恢復了、平津靑漢等處的客人、在今春也曾有少數來滬配貨、但數量已退至戰前的一半、武漢等處則以長江嚴加封鎖、運銷更還不可期、他們部一致宣說、英美的貨銷、在華北長江、不久都將沒有地位了、這當然是受人排擠的必然結果、呢絨的內銷前途　當然也脫不了這個悲慘的這遇吧、</p>

<p>— 竾仙</p>
<p>奶奶娘姨們多說我們不識字　特種居民了烏龍高視闊歩</p>
<p>爲着安全運動、我被派在四馬路廣西路轉角服務、</p>
<p>在未出發以前、校長先生特地召集我們、除發給一塊臂章、一桿小旗、和幾十張傳單以外、對我們還有一番簡短的訓話、</p>
<p>我於八小時二十分到達指定地點、剛逢着辦公時間、汽車連頭接尾的由跑馬廳駛來、同時行人也特別多、從小菜場歸來的奶奶娘姨們、大筐小籃地邊走邊還要和同伴談話、他們往往三四椚人並排走在一起、因此總有一兩位離開人行道走在馬路邊、他們呶唧農農（口旁）地講着話、非到車子開到脚限頭不肯罷休、我特地將傳單散給這些人、然而她們大都是拒而不受、有的說、我不認識字、有的說這東西我不知看見多少了、可惜安全運動所印發的傳單、幾天來就祇這一種、圖畫即不甚動人、字句也欠通俗、尤其因爲沒有顏色二以致連孩子們也不感興趣——可是我們知道、十件車輛肇禍案中、犧牲者至少有七件是無知的孩子、</p>
<p>近九點鐘、提鳥籠的上海特種居民敞着褂子由跑馬廳絡繹而來、他們挺胸突肚的行路姿勢、使對面來的婦　們不得不避道而行、然面卽在婦儒們的脚踏在馬路邊的時候、不是前面衝來了汽事、便是董包車夫在後面狂叫着讓路。但是特種居民依舊髙視闊步地向前走着、有時還特地以屁股横撞着旁邊的女人、　　更囘過頭來望着受　者狰　　笑、</p>
<p>我說：「先生、請你走路不要權着　　」。</p>
<p>「怎麼！走路還講究個樣兒褻？」他依然髙視闊步地向前行進。</p>
<p>四馬路的路面、自『肫肝大王一以達廣西路口這一段、狹窄得只能容兩輛小奥斯汀來往、然而在這叚路以東、有着小菜場和有名的靑蓬閣、小菜場於十時一過、來往的人便很少了、惟靑蓮閣却整天有很多的人進出、此外還有若干茶室酒樓望垣對宇地排列着、婿喜慶弔的車子、因而便不斷在這條路來往、這段路之西、除同樣的有許多酒樓外、更有大羅天和天蟾舞台兩個戲院、開鎅及散戲的時候、便不辦車在人縫中開或人在車縫中走！像這樣一個擠擁的路口、單　一個警捕兩條手臂自然不足以保證一安全』了！提到警捕、在我短短的服務時間內、便發現許多缺點、第一他縱容擺象棋　的在人行道上聚賭、雖經我的請求而不加干涉、後來我們幾個服務的同學堅持着要他去驅逐、他這　懶洋洋地和棋攤旁站着的一個穿黑印度綢長衫的漢子耳語了一會、棋難便卽撤去、這眞令人莫明其妙、其次、他的指揮交通、好像于汽車特別寬容、有時汽車還在跑馬廳口、他便不顧佇候在廣西路兩頭的人力車及自由車、因之廣西路兩頤的車輛便愈聚愈衆多、</p>
<p>爲着望平街的被封鎖、由四馬路到五馬路的人、便不得不繞道廣西路、因此廣西路行人激增、我以爲上海近來車輛肇禍事件之所以特別多、由於行人及司機者的過失、固然不少、然而最大原因、還是爲了馬路的面積未能容納這樣多的人和車、所以在樣的情形下、單消極的舉辦安全運動、事實上不會收到完美的效果、而若干里弄通路的開放、其有裨於行人安全者定較我們在烈日下鵠立幾天爲多、</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Great Significance of the International "China Week" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since we launched our sacred War of Resistance, the greatest sympathy and most active assistance has been shown to us by the people of various countries. They are the most able to deeply recognize the momentous significance of China's War of Resistance in human history, so their support is the most sincere and their assistance is the most active. We have been fighting for the upholding of true peace and human justice for two full years, so our international friends, who sympathize with us the most and assist us the most actively, have again launched a "China Week" to commemorate the "July 7th" Incident. American groups in New York held a "China Week," and Chinese and American residents in Washington will also hold a "July 7th" parade, and it is heard that Democratic Senator Thomas and leaders of organizations such as the American Federation of Labor will also participate. Other places, such as Chicago and New York, Boston, will also hold Mass. The British China Aid Committee also recently launched a "China Week" to mobilize British public opinion to jointly assist China, and specially published a daily newspaper, named "China News," whose role is particularly important. The significance of Britain's commemoration of China's War of Resistance is particularly significant.</p>
<p>Today, the sympathy and role of public opinion of the people of various countries are particularly worthy of our attention. We know that the × people's war of aggression against China has been quite exhausted. We faintly hear that after their internal recent disputes and quarrels, they have reached a general conclusion, unanimously hoping to end the war in the autumn of this year to save their own peril, and wanting to replace military action with diplomatic means. At this time, what Japan most hopes for is for Britain to come forward to mediate; the Tianjin incident is a concentrated expression of this. Britain has even made concessions to Japan to some extent. This point has indeed received great criticism from the British people, but judging from the current situation, the actions of the British government authorities still need more enthusiastic supervision. Yesterday's "China News" published an editorial by the famous novelist Beverly Nichols, which stated: "We must find a way to prevent British policy from benefiting tyrannical aggressors; on the contrary, we should make it assist steadfast and persevering resisters." This is such a great warning and admonition!</p>
<p>On the British side, the "China Campaign Committee" is the most developed, with London as its headquarters, and branches in places such as Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, and Liverpool. The China Campaign Committee is the most active group in aiding China. We believe that they will be able to more actively supervise the future movements of the British government's Far East policy. London will hold a mass rally on "July 7th," which will certainly have a positive expression in correcting British policy, which we can predict.</p>
<p>Britain is a democratic country, and the government's political and diplomatic policies are subject to the supervision and guidance of the people. This kind of power is expressed in the questions in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and in the people's public opinion and actions. The British government has always been subject to this kind of powerful supervision. At present, Britain has three major events to resolve carefully: one is how to deal with Japan in the Far East, the second is how to deal with Germany and Italy in Europe, and the third is how to quickly complete the Anglo-Soviet-French alliance agreement. And these three are closely related, and are all about the work of concluding an anti-aggression front. Whether Britain can correctly handle these issues has a great relationship to the world's justice and peace. Therefore, the responsibility borne by the British people at this time is particularly great. We hope that the British people can use this memorial day to commemorate the heroic resistance against aggressors, and have more concrete and effective expressions in speech and action!</p>

<h3 id="e2">On Guerrilla Warfare in the Plains <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shiti</p>
<p>(4) A general prohibition on the use of envelopes and stationery printed with battalion numbers. Envelopes and stationery printed with battalion numbers are only to be used for important formal official documents to friendly forces or government agencies, but the less the better.</p>
<p>(5) When marching, flags should be rolled up and road signs should use markings. The rear guard should have specialized personnel to collect road signs and eliminate traces left by the march. When necessary, fake road signs can be deliberately set up to deceive the enemy. During daytime marches, attention should be paid to camouflage; during nighttime marches, smoking and lighting fires, loud talking, and other noises are prohibited!</p>
<p>(6) Headquarters must use code names. During marches, slogans should be placed in open spaces and shaded from the air as much as possible to prevent × air raids and reconnaissance.</p>
<p>(8) When camping in areas close to × areas, news must be carefully blocked. Plainclothes reconnaissance personnel should be sent to the campsite in advance. The masses are prohibited from going to the × side, and the警戒部队 must prohibit the masses from leaving the警戒线, but they must explain it well to the masses. If it is necessary to go out, and the situation permits, personnel from the troops must be sent to take them or give them passes, but the passes should not write battalion numbers on them.</p>
<p>(9) When leaders reconnoiter terrain, they should not bring too many personnel and must be concealed. It is best to all wear plain clothes and avoid riding horses as much as possible (if riding horses, they should be left further behind.)</p>
<p>(19) When ambushing, blocking the news is even more important. It must be done so that not a single member of the masses leaks the news. Even the masses passing through the ambush site must be explained to well upon their return. According to the materials on the × people's "suppression" operations against our Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, "One example of judging whether there are × in a village: first, when there are no × people in the village, the people's children play in front of the door, and there are villagers in the fields; second, when × people are near the village, there is no one in the fields, the doors are bolted shut, and men look around on the roofs; third, when × people are in the village, no human figures can be found, and during the autumn harvest season, the reaping is also stopped." Therefore, if there are no people or activity when sealing off the ambush site, then the × people can immediately judge that our army is ambushing, so we must send out disguised personnel to work in the fields and move around in the villages. These disguised personnel can also participate in the war during wartime, which is also beneficial.</p>
<p>Mass Work</p>
<p>Establishing guerrilla bases in the plains mainly relies on mass conditions. There are many masses in the plains, but this is only one aspect of the conditions. The main thing is to rely on us to mobilize, organize, and lead them to engage in arduous struggles with the × people, in order to demonstrate the great and unconquerable power of the masses. This is how the so-called reliance on mass conditions is completed.</p>
<p>Troops operating in the plains should pay attention to the following central issues in mass work:</p>
<p>(1) There must be a high degree of political discipline. The masses' first impression and understanding of the troops often uses the troops' discipline as the standard, so every person must start by observing political discipline and use strict mass discipline to gain the support and belief of the masses.</p>
<p>(2) Active actions and combat victories should be used to arouse the masses and enhance their anti-Japanese sentiment and confidence in victory.</p>
<p>(3) Mass work is the most important link in our entire work. Do not view it as merely the work of political organs, political personnel, or mass movement workers. Every one of us should become a model for propaganda, organization, and leadership of the masses, and the most active member in participating in mass work.</p>
<p>(4) Cherish the masses, delve into the masses' problems, accept the masses' opinions, and also learn from the masses and become one with the masses.</p>
<p>(5) Protect the interests of the masses, improve the lives of the masses, and give the masses democracy and freedom. (End)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan, This Newspaper, 5th] In Guangdong, our counter-attacking army has crossed south of Xinjie and is still in fierce battle with the ×. A large number of our plainclothes teams have infiltrated the vicinity of Shijing and suburban Guangzhou, and × are extremely active. It is heard that most of the × troops in Foshan have withdrawn, and唐佈吿 have been posted, enticing our people to submit to the puppet organization. According to information indirectly obtained from various sources: (1) On the Hainan front, 200 × troops with more than 10 armored vehicles from Jiaji attacked the Anhangshi Dalu area on the 1st. They were intercepted by our regular army and guerrilla teams, and are still in a stalemate with the ×. We killed dozens of × and destroyed 2 vehicles. Our side suffered injuries to a lieutenant platoon leader, 1, and 2 soldiers; (2) On the Nan'an front, yesterday the × troops attacking Xiaolukeng and Xiaowo were fiercely attacked by us, and are now being pursued to Yangmei; (3) On the Jianghui front, the × troops in Huicheng have been besieged by us for days, suffering heavy casualties. They appear to be breaking out and retreating to Jiangmen. The × near Linkeng Zhongshan were killed by us dozens, and the remnants collapsed. The shallow-water gunboats of the Jiujiang Heqing × shelled Gulao yesterday morning, we suffered no losses.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Although the Japanese army in the Fujian sea has shelled Fuzhou and its surrounding areas for days and sent aircraft for extensive bombing, it has made several attempts to land in Lianjiang, but has not yet succeeded. The Chinese army on the coast of Fujian Province is now calmly fighting. Furthermore, residents in various coastal areas remain extremely calm and have not shown any signs of panic. According to observers here, the actual strength of the Japanese army in the Fujian sea is still insufficient to launch a major landing in Fuzhou, as a large number of Chinese troops have arrived in various coastal areas of Fujian Province in recent days.</p>
<p>Situation in the Hubei-Jiangxi War Zone</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] According to news from Hubei Province, the Japanese army east of the Hanshui River originally planned to join forces with the Japanese army advancing west from Tingxi to Qianjiang and launch another major offensive, but was forced to abandon its plan due to the continuous and fierce counterattacks by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 4th] Seventeen aircraft in batches attacked Jiangxi on the 4th. The first batch of three aircraft invaded the urban area of Ji'an at around 7 a.m., dropping four bombs in the suburbs, killing one civilian. The second batch of three aircraft sneaked to Dengjiapu, a subordinate of Chujiang County, at around 8 a.m., dropping six bombs, all of which landed in the wilderness, causing no losses. The × aircraft then sneaked to Shangrao.

<h3 id="e5">Chairman Chiang's Hand-Written Instructions, The Key Points of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, Taking the Initiative to Fight, Relying on Our Own Efforts, Preparing for a Bitter Struggle, The Guangdong Military Region Issues Orders to Comply With <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Shaoguan News] The National Military Training Department of the Guangdong Military Region Command recently issued an order, stating that the second phase of the War of Resistance is now unfolding, and the responsibility of this department is becoming more important, and our work is becoming more extensive. Regarding the key points of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the leader has enlightened us with a handwritten instruction, which is clear and profound, and of great importance. It is appropriate to copy and circulate this order for knowledge, and to encourage everyone to work together and conscientiously implement it in order to win the final victory. Now, Chairman Chiang's handwritten instructions on the key points of the second phase of the War of Resistance are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>The key points of the second phase of the War of Resistance: 1. Politics is more important than military affairs; 2. The people are more important than soldiers. It is better to use the people than to use soldiers, and it is better to teach the people than to teach soldiers. Teaching soldiers is the spirit of teaching one's own children; 3. Spirit is more important than material. Two things should be used for two purposes, one bullet should be used as two bullets, and one day should be used as two days. It all depends on spirit to supplement the insufficiency of material; 4. Organization should emphasize practicality (not position). The military supplies, military medicine, staff, adjutant, intelligence, communications, transportation, and various organs should be reorganized and inspected, and the ability and academic qualifications of personnel should be carefully examined to ensure that they are competent and responsible, so as to comprehensively match name and reality, increase work efficiency, and achieve the mission of the War of Resistance; 5. Training is more important than combat. The selection, examination, and training of cadres are particularly important, and must be continuously trained in rotation in stages. Inspections must also be conducted regularly, and grades A and B must be evaluated and announced monthly; 6. Intelligence is more important than judgment and imagination; 7. Study the situation of the ×, pay attention to the selection of intelligence personnel, analyze the current and future practical environment, and develop various work plans; 8. Reorganizing is more important than purchasing. We must reorganize, repair, manage, and process; 9. Propaganda is more important than combat; 10. Discipline is more important than everything; 11. Orders are more important than life. In order to execute orders, even sacrificing one's life is worth it. Listened to the donation of life; 12. Action is more important than theory; 13. Group meetings, reviewing work, and self-criticism are more important than formal education; 14. Various work plans and instructions must be executed regularly, and the effectiveness must be inspected to assess rewards and punishments; 15. Special skills are more important than broad learning. It must be simple and easy to understand; 16 (The importance of common sense). With common sense, one can adapt to the situation based on the location, time, person, and object; 17. Retrenchment is more important than production, and frugality is more important than abundance; 18. Law, political economy, scientific common sense, and the theory of the Three Principles of the People and its philosophical foundation; 19. Construction and creation are more important than war. Our military generals must realize that the foundation of the victory of the War of Resistance in the future lies entirely in our ability to fight independently, rely on our own efforts, and be thrifty, hardworking, and tolerant in everything, be independent and self-reliant, and prepare for five or ten years of bitter struggle, so that the ultimate goal of the War of Resistance can be achieved.</p>

It is heard that Commander Qiao was seriously injured because he took the lead. According to the news, Qiao is from Qingshuihe and graduated from the Central Military Academy. He is known for his loyalty, courage, and righteousness, and is hated by the ×. The × had previously kidnapped his father, hoping to make him a puppet, but he refused to be set up. Now Qiao has been injured for the country again, which can be called a loyal man.</p>

<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 5th] On the 4th, American Independence Day, President Kong gave a special broadcast speech to the American people, expressing our country's gratification with the current close relationship between China and the United States, and gratitude to the United States for the encouragement and assistance given to our country during the period of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The text of President Kong's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Today marks the 163rd anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence. I am very pleased to be able to speak to the American people on this commemorative day. On behalf of the Chinese people, I extend to you my most sincere congratulations and wish you an infinitely glorious future. All those with free thought in the world should celebrate the emergence of the great American Republic. The American Declaration of Independence is not only the highest expression of human freedom and equality, but also the establishment of a country that has contributed to human progress and world peace and order no less than any other country. The birth of your country has greatly stimulated the growth of modern democracy. The history of your nation is full of great achievements of human perseverance and struggle, such as pioneers, colonizers, the age of machines, modern commerce and industry, the rise of common people to power, and the improvement of human life. If the entire world could have the opportunity to maintain peace and happiness as the United States does, then human life could be raised to a high level. Your country's efforts in the "Open Door" policy, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have created your country's position and honor in the international community. I join you today in celebration. If I did not express to you our country's gratification with the long-standing and cordial relationship between China and the United States, and our gratitude for the encouragement and assistance your country has given us during the period of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, then I would not be able to speak on behalf of the Chinese people. In terms of commerce, education, culture, and international affairs, the United States has become China's friend and guide. Recently, your government's measures to purchase Chinese silver and extend the credit period for Chinese loans have provided our country with practical assistance in maintaining finance and the legal tender. The people's efforts to help China in its war disasters have given our country sympathy and financial aid, encouraging our people to firmly resist aggression for freedom. The Chinese people are grateful for the friendship of the American people, a friendship built on the close relationship between the two nations.</p>
<p>I am unable to celebrate with you today, but some of you may still remember that two years ago, I attended the glorious Fourth of July celebration in your country. The world at that time was more pleasant than today, because today we are troubled by war and war rumors. The inspiration given to us by the Declaration of Independence and the international agreements jointly protected by China and the United States has been affected by the war and aggression found in most of the world today. The spirit of understanding and coordination has succumbed to barbaric violence. The dignity of international law and conventions has been trampled upon. The international security system has been greatly threatened. Humanity seems to have been forced into another "Dark Age". Human progress is being prevented, and culture is on the verge of danger. The war of independence fought by a quarter of the world's population on Chinese soil has been going on for two years. Japan's modern armaments cause the death and destruction of our innocent people every day, devastating our undefended cities and remote towns hundreds of miles away from the front lines. The terror, brutality, and lawlessness brought about by Japanese aggression are not only intolerable to civilized people in the 20th century, but also offend the intellect and solemnity of mankind. The place where I am speaking now is a city with such unfortunate experiences. It has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese planes, innocent people have been massacred, and civilian property has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Can Japan's bombs and machine guns scare the Chinese people into submission? Our Republic, though young, has a national system similar to that of your country. But will our country perish under Japanese aggression? Four hundred and fifty million Chinese souls all say "No". Japan's terror tactics cannot destroy our spirit, cannot destroy our national soul, and can only strengthen our will to resist. It is indeed difficult for us to resist aggression with imperfect armaments, but we have the determination to resist to the end. We are determined to resist aggression, and for two years now, we have broken the myth of the invincible Japanese army. We are determined to continue the war of resistance, no matter how many years it takes, until Japan understands that China cannot be conquered and until China gains freedom and regeneration from the arduous war of resistance. We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to us, because we know that justice and fairness are on our side. We are fighting for human freedom and equality. We are fighting for our "land", for our sacred families, for our magnificent antiquities, for our peaceful progress, for our national survival and independence. Moreover, the purpose of our war of resistance is to fight for civilized mankind. We resist the aggression of international plunderers. We resist the primary enemy of international security. We resist the plague of aggression and the disturbers of world peace. We resist militarists. We resist the executioners of democracy and popular self-determination. We resist the new state of "undeclared war," such as looting, bombing, massacring non-combatants in undefended cities, destroying cultural institutions, disregarding the rights of neutral countries, and infringing upon the sovereignty of neutral countries, such as the famous Panay incident. We resist the domineering military power that is fantasizing about Japan's "sacred mission" to rule the world. Its invasion of China is the first step in an attempt to realize the dream of dominating Asia, controlling the Pacific, and ruling the world. We resist ambitious aggressor nations. If these countries can control China's manpower and resources, they will not hesitate to extend their greedy hands to seize the land of other countries in the Pacific and Asia, or even invade their borders. Our war of resistance can be said to be not only for our own country, but also for your country and the world. At the same time, we are also fighting for the innocent people and laborers of Japan who are currently oppressed by the military, because we firmly believe that the final victory of justice in Asia will give the Japanese people freedom and will not allow them to suffer under feudal forces.</p>
<p>With this belief, our people feel gratified, even though they are making extremely tragic sacrifices in the war of resistance against aggression. We are not discouraged, but rather feel honored to make this great sacrifice, because we are fighting for world freedom and peace. We persist in this goal and continue to struggle, because without peace and freedom, life has no purpose. Your country's great patriot, Patrick Henry, once said, "Give me liberty, or give me death." We certainly share the same feeling.</p>
<p>Moreover, the maintenance of international law and justice is not a matter for one country. Closing one's eyes and ignoring world events cannot protect one's rights, because this is no different from an ostrich burying its head in the sand to avoid danger. A robber attacking a neighbor's door, hiding in a quilt, cannot guarantee his own safety. A neighbor's house catching fire, covering the windows and doors, cannot guarantee that his house will not be affected. America's peace and security cannot be separated from the world. To seek peace, one must strive for peace. To seek security, one must pay the price of security.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you that Japan's engagement in war is not entirely its own doing. Its invasion of China relies on other countries, especially the United States, to supply it with military materials and armaments. To purchase military supplies, it must also sell its products. For example, Japan must buy scrap iron and cotton from your country, but it must sell its raw silk to your country. With this relationship, Japanese aggressors can be contained. At the same time, the American people also have the opportunity to help stop the ambitions of the Japanese island nation. With economic power alone, the United States can defeat Japan. Once the United States strengthens its economic sanctions against Japan, Japan's feet of clay will be unable to extricate themselves. The United States can stop Japan's aggression without participating in the war.</p>
<p>Today, as we celebrate the American Declaration of Independence, I feel ashamed to mention the international threat to the principles listed in the Declaration of Independence. But as far as China is concerned, everything is clear and everything has been arranged. We are fighting our third year of the war of independence in Asia, only drawing inspiration from the great sacrifices of your country's ancestors, and striving to win freedom and equality. I look forward to the day when "world peace and human friendship" will arrive, when the two great republics of the Pacific will commemorate the idea that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish" and celebrate with each other.</p>
<h3 id="e11">My View of the Battlefield - Former Commander-in-Chief of the Xth War Zone <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zhuoying</p>
<p>The sacred war of national resistance against Japan has just reached its second anniversary. The true experience of the great battlefield makes me feel more deeply that war is destruction, but also creation, elimination, and also purification.</p>
<p>The feudal remnants of old Chinese society, and the selfish, self-interested, complacent, and cowardly inferior nature,</p>
<p>were destroyed by the ruthless artillery fire. However, on the other hand, you will know: what is newly created on the battlefield is the most advanced model of the universe and mankind, and the vibrant, bright, hot, and powerful new Chinese national spirit.</p>
<p>In the sound of artillery fire, there are inevitably many people who are physically weak, lack courage, are weak in will, and even willingly degenerate, who are eliminated by the raging waves of war. However, in another situation, you may know that countless new citizens without education, especially enthusiastic young people, are being tempered by the furnace of war, and are becoming more solid and lively. Brave and capable, they walk onto the battlefield with their chests held high and smiles on their faces, to defend their motherland.</p>
<p>I believe that this is a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation, a force for the creation of a new China, and a reliable guarantee of the final victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>For this reason, I often have three kinds of imaginations about the battlefield:</p>
<p>First, I imagine the battlefield as a "testing ground", where it is best to test who is capable, who is incapable or unwilling, who is competent, who is incompetent, who is brave, who is cowardly; who is willing to seek progress and accept purification, and who is willing to give up and be eliminated by nature.</p>
<p>Second, I imagine the battlefield as a "school", where soldiers are trained while fighting, and where they study while fighting. While working, they also teach, taking the front line and trenches as classrooms, and fighting as a daily lesson. At the same time, they are also preparing to use their war achievements to create a new Chinese military science.</p>
<p>Third, on the contrary, I imagine the battlefield as a "sea". In this vast, bottomless sea, where the waves rise and fall, anything can be accommodated. We must completely eliminate the limited Japanese invaders in this sea, so that they cannot return with a single piece of armor!</p>
<h3 id="e12">A Toad Wants to Eat Swan Meat (Part 2) - The Japanese Army Coerces and Threatens Us to Negotiate Peace <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>"What about the 'words' of the Chinese people before, and the facts of 'pouring' today?"</p>
<p>"North China, Central China, and South China are completely in the hands of Japan. The Party government is about to present internal disputes. As a result, the great figure Wang Jingwei went to Shanghai to flee..." How great is the great figure? I am afraid that even Wang Jingwei himself would have doubts, let alone the people in the war zone.</p>
<p>It also says: "The people of Japan and China are both East Asian compatriots, and it is appropriate for them to shake hands with each other to practice friendship." Afterwards, there are also photos of female stars, each making an ecstatic gesture; the so-called Imperial Proclamation is nothing more than this!</p>
<p>Another Disguise of Leaflets</p>
<p>The Japanese spread some nonsensical leaflets and issue some stuttering proclamations. Knowing that their treacherous schemes are difficult to sell and will inevitably fail, they then temporarily print these small-sized color newspapers from the perspective of a certain "Chinese person", in an attempt to deceive our people in the war zone again. However, bad seeds will never grow good seedlings. The paper is full of distorted theories, even more like a crazy girl applying white powder, which only increases her ugliness.</p>
<p>For example, there is a so-called "Peace Newspaper," published by the "Reorganized Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang." The first red-letter headline on the first page fabricates news about how the national government is being reorganized: "President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke; Minister of Military Affairs, XXX; Minister of Political Affairs, Zhou Enlai; Vice Minister of Military Affairs, Lin Biao." Except for Zhou Enlai, who originally served as the Vice Minister of the Political Department, everyone knows that the rest are all fabrications.</p>
<p>Next is a special article, which publishes the traitor Jingwei's "Open Letter to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek," which roughly states that "Japan has abandoned aggression by using troops to fight (?)" Wang is determined to deceive people, and still urges Chairman Chiang to negotiate peace with Japan quickly.</p>
<p>Then there is "Wang Zhaoming's Third Statement," the main idea of which is to defend his advocacy of peace with Japan, which is something that should be done a thousand times over, and to refute the Central Government's decision to expel him from the party and, in particular, to issue a warrant for his arrest. In the article, there is a sentence that says, "Now I (Wang himself) am indeed said to be Qin Hui by a part of the people." The editor (with a Japanese accent) added a note at the end of the article, which roughly stated that "Qin Hui was a person from the Southern Song Dynasty after the Sui and Tang Dynasties. At that time, Yue Fei, who was famous throughout the world 150 years (?) ago, trusted him and appointed him as prime minister. Later, he left Yue Fei and negotiated peace with the Jin people alone. The world criticized him as a traitor. Now Wang Zhaoming is very similar to him, so a part of the people (more than a part) scold him as a traitor. But the people should know: as a result, Yue Fei was killed by Qin Hui." Good heavens, Wang Jingwei wants to kill today's Yue Fei—countless national heroes. What a great ability to sell the country. Doesn't he feel ashamed to say it?</p>
<p>Later, they fabricated a telegram saying that Li Zongren, Chen Cheng, Xue Yue, and others were praising Wang Jingwei, and had jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang: "Give Wang an opportunity to roll up his sleeves and start again." In fact, Li, Chen, Xue, and others, who doesn't know that they are famous anti-Japanese generals with glorious achievements? In particular, when General Li talked to reporters about the traitor Wang's problem, ×××××××××! As for the so-called praise, even a three-year-old child would not believe it.</p>
<p>The second page of the "Peace Newspaper" is called "Rocket," which has a short commentary that says, "China should have resisted Japan at the time of the September 18th Incident, from the Chinchow Agreement, to even the fall of Wuhan, and even when Japan repeatedly offered to accept peace, China should have jumped into its arms..." This is simply nonsense. Next, they praise those smelly little feet that the world has long disdained—all the traitorous theories are chewed over and over again.</p>
<p>The third page is called "South Wind" (South Wind is stealing the name of the literary and art section of the Yunnan Daily), but it is full of pornographic writing. For example, they cut and arranged a section of a long pornographic novel from a certain Hong Kong tabloid on it, but they do not indicate that it is a reprint. In addition, they insert nude photos of Western prostitutes, as well as obscene pictures that are unbearable to look at. Their wishful thinking must be that in this way, they can anesthetize our military and civilians in the war zone so that they cannot even fire their guns. However, the folk customs of Qin and Jin are simple and ancient, and they are most taboo about advocating theft and obscenity. The Japanese sending out this kind of lewd pictures and texts will only cause extreme resentment: the new youth laugh at their dirty methods, and the elderly are simply upset because it damages public morals. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Su-French-Soviet Negotiations Have Not Yet Fully Matured; Although the Baltic Sea Problem Has Been Solved, Guarantees to the Netherlands and Switzerland Have Created New Difficulties <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] According to diplomatic reporters here, the recent obstacles in the Moscow negotiations are due to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to provide anti-aggression guarantees to the Netherlands and Switzerland, because the two countries have not yet officially recognized the Soviet government. However, the British government has made further concessions and is approaching the Soviet demands in order to guarantee the Baltic countries. The "Daily Express" stated that Britain has recently notified the Soviet Union that it is willing to guarantee the Baltic countries, but the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must be expanded to include guarantees to the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as countries already guaranteed by Britain and France, such as Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, and Portugal. The "News Chronicle" stated that new difficulties seem to have arisen in the British-Soviet negotiations. The British side believes that if guarantees are needed for countries along the German border, then guarantees should also be given to countries on other borders. The "Daily Mail" also expressed similar views on the British-Soviet negotiations, and said that people in the government and the House of Commons are gradually recognizing that the Soviet Union is deliberately delaying the negotiations in order to undermine Chamberlain's position. Supporters of the government were previously extremely concerned about the British-Soviet agreement and hoped that it would be established as soon as possible, but are now disappointed by its indefinite extension. Some members of Congress even believe that if the British-Soviet agreement has any value, it will be reduced due to the long delay.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 5th) According to the opinions of some diplomatic reporters, there are still difficulties in expanding the scope of guarantees in the Moscow negotiations. It is heard that Britain has accepted the Soviet demands and is willing to guarantee the three Baltic countries, but requires that the Soviet-British agreement must also guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland. The Times commented today that no country in the world should join the guarantee system against its will. Therefore, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should quickly sign a treaty of mutual assistance. At the same time, Britain and France can use diplomacy to encourage the Baltic countries to understand that it is the best way to protect their true interests to form an alliance with the three anti-aggression countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] According to Soviet sources in London, the recent British proposal has further catered to the Soviet point of view. At present, all issues have not been fully clarified. It is heard that the two sides are closer on the Baltic Sea issue, but there are still some points that need to be clarified further.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 4th] Authoritative sources here do not believe the widespread rumors that the British-French-Soviet agreement has actually been completed and will be signed soon. Although the negotiations are progressing very well, there is no indication whether the problem of guaranteeing the Baltic Sea coast countries has been resolved. Well-informed sources believe that Molotov's reply contains the need to further discuss the proposal, so the negotiations will need to be extended for some time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent learned from well-informed sources that the widespread rumors that the British-French-Soviet anti-aggression negotiations have been completed are somewhat premature. The negotiations were originally hoped to be concluded at this time, but some points raised in the Soviet reply obviously need to be considered further. It is heard that the two sides are immediately continuing to negotiate other matters, and it is hoped that the agreement will not be delayed.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 4th] Today, all the newspapers here are criticizing the British-Soviet negotiations with a reserved attitude. Most newspapers only reported that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union and British special envoy Strang had met with Foreign Minister Molotov again. Some political figures here believe that the Soviet press has not criticized the recent British-French proposals, which they consider to be a "hopeful symbol."</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Future of the Tokyo Negotiations is Completely Bleak; The Views of the Two Sides are Diametrically Opposed; Failure and Stranding are Inevitable <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Foreign News from Hong Kong] Since the British and Japanese sides put forward their demands in the Tokyo negotiations, well-informed sources believe that the negotiations may end in failure. According to the Japanese side's Domei News Agency, the British authorities notified the Japanese side that the prerequisite for the British negotiations was that the Japanese side stop blockading the British Concession. On the other hand, the Japanese side demanded that 50 million yuan of Chinese capital deposited in Chinese banks within the British Concession should be transferred to the Japanese side before negotiations could begin. Therefore, it is generally believed that the negotiations may be stranded due to these diametrically opposed points. At present, it is slim to persuade the Japanese army in Tianjin to ease its blockade of the British Concession. In fact, it has been tightened since last Saturday. Tokyo believes that the British authorities will refuse to transfer the Chinese deposits. Some sources claim that the deposits have already been moved from the Tianjin British Concession to a British warship.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] According to reports, the Japanese military authorities are now "repeatedly seeking various methods to obtain British assistance for Japanese currency in North China and to acquiesce in Japan's actions to invade China." The Times diplomatic correspondent quoted the above report and said, "If the Japanese side raises this point, then the Tokyo negotiations will not make any progress. The British government is prepared to guarantee the neutrality of the Tianjin Concession to Japan, and to extradite the four Chinese suspects to the Japanese side upon confirmation of their crimes. But other than this, Britain cannot arbitrarily accept any demands."</p>
<p>Calls for Toughness</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Last night, two experts on Far Eastern issues gave speeches in London on the future of China. Prominent news correspondent Ding Bairui spoke to representatives of Parliament, believing that the Tianjin issue was a probing action. If Britain shows a slight concession to Japan, then the possibility of cooperation between the United States and Britain in the Far East and Europe will also be hopeless. If Britain can take resolute steps, then the United States is willing to support Britain in the Far East and Europe, so that Britain can take a firmer position. Far Eastern economic expert Gabo Chick also gave a speech to the 1912 Club at the same time, saying that it is not clear when the Japanese warlords will end the war without declaring war as soon as possible, making their victory a mirage. Domestic commercial finance has been greatly affected. Japan's misfortunes are entirely the result of the arrogance of the Japanese warlords. The war without declaring war will end with a peace without declaring. It is not easy for Britain to maintain its business in China. However, we must strengthen our entire policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Yesterday, the Chinese newspapers here jointly published a commentary criticizing the British-Japanese negotiations to be held in Tokyo, warning Britain to beware of the Japanese tricks, and urging them not to be confused by Japanese diplomats.</p>
<p>Japan Intensifies Anti-British Sentiment</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 4th] The anti-British movement in various Japanese-controlled areas has intensified. A demonstration was held in Qingdao yesterday in front of the British Consulate. They wanted to post anti-British slogans on the walls of the consulate, but were stopped. Other locations in the city were plastered with them. The Japanese are vigorously encouraging the Chinese to be anti-British, but the Chinese have not shown any real anti-British sentiment.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Xiamen Correspondent] On the 29th of last month, the Japanese again made a new request to the Gulangyu Public Concession Bureau, requesting the appointment of a Japanese police officer. The Concession Bureau had previously agreed to appoint three Japanese detectives. The newly appointed Japanese police officer will cooperate with the Japanese consular police, and his position will be second only to the police chief, and his responsibility will be to provide the police chief with opinions on police affairs. Currently, the police chief is assisted by a foreign police officer and a Japanese deputy police officer. Since the Japanese army implemented the blockade, the lack of food in Gulangyu has become increasingly serious. Meat and vegetables are very scarce, and their prices have increased more than twice as much as usual. Almost all foreigners rely on canned food supplies, while most of the 60,000 Chinese people maintain a minimum standard of living. The Concession Bureau has tried to transport in wood. The newspapers in Gulangyu controlled by the Japanese are condemning the Concession Bureau, saying that the Concession Bureau should be fully responsible for the current situation in Gulangyu.</p>

<p>(Haitong Agency, London, 5th) According to sources in the press here, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will issue a declaration in the House of Commons today clarifying Britain's guarantee to Poland, including any changes in the political situation in Danzig. The "Daily Express" states that Chamberlain will specify that any unilateral change in Danzig's status, regardless of the method, will cause Britain to implement its guarantee to Poland. This British attitude will prevent Danzig from using force to change its status. The only method of negotiation to bring about political changes in Danzig remains possible.</p>
<p>(Haitong Agency, Paris, 4th) According to news published in British and French newspapers last week, the Polish government will issue a note to Danzig requesting an explanation of Danzig's military measures. This claim has been denied by Danzig. After a meeting between the Polish ambassador to France and the French Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon, sources close to the French Foreign Ministry stated that Warsaw has not yet sent this note to Danzig and does not anticipate sending it in the future. The French Ambassador to Poland, Noël, is currently in Paris and will soon return to his post. Before leaving, he will visit Foreign Minister Bonnet for discussions.</p>
<p>(Haitong Agency, Vatican City, 5th) The Pope has not yet given up on mediating the serious international situation, especially the dispute between Germany and Poland. Local circles are paying particular attention to the return to Rome of the Holy See's representative to Poland after a lengthy discussion with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. At the same time, the long-vacant position of Polish Ambassador to the Vatican has recently been filled by the government. Although the Polish press strongly denies that the Pope will act as a mediator, local circles still hope that the Pope will advise Poland to adopt a more moderate attitude.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Vatican City, 5th] Pope Pius XII, originally scheduled to go to Castel Gandolfo for the summer, has postponed his trip by one or two weeks because papal diplomatic representatives are currently active in various countries, holding negotiations in the hope of alleviating the serious international situation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Today, British Minister of Commerce Stanley reported in the House of Commons that during the period from January to May of this year, 2.25 million pounds of tea were imported from Japan, accounting for 1.5% of total tea imports during the same period. He learned that Japanese tea of ​​inferior quality was sold at six or seven pence per pound (including tax), and that these teas were mixed with teas produced in Britain for cheaper sale. He has no power to stop its import. Labor MP Sorensen asked if the Minister knew that Japanese tea was being mixed with Ceylon tea and Indian tea from the Empire and sold as Empire tea. Stanley replied that if Mr. Sorensen could provide accurate information on this matter, he would investigate it. However, the information he himself had obtained indicated that the situation was not as such, so under current law, he had no power to stop it. Stanley also answered supplementary questions, stating that the tea was not being misrepresented as being from the Empire.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Labor MP Sorensen today asked in the House of Commons about the latest developments in the Anglo-American Goods Exchange Agreement and whether the British government had made further provisions with the US government or other governments. Stanley replied that the US Senate had approved the agreement. The legislature is now considering authorizing the US government to purchase the necessary cotton goods. It is hoped that once this necessary authority has been obtained, the agreement can take effect immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e20">British War Secretary Speech Explains the Permanent Solidarity of Britain and France; Resolutely Deal With External Provocations <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 4th) British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha delivered a speech at the annual banquet of the Anglo-French Association tonight, emphasizing British-French solidarity in the face of external provocations. He said, "Let the world understand that Britain and France fully understand the nature of external provocations. When necessary, we will resolutely deal with them. The current situation has placed us in a defensive position. It would be a serious mistake for outside observers to draw any erroneous conclusions from this fact. It would be an even greater mistake if those on the side also draw erroneous conclusions. Since we have no intention of aggression, we will certainly not be the first to act. Superficial observers may see this as our weakness, but on the whole, this is our strength." Hore-Belisha then mentioned the close relationship between the British and French armies, saying that they do not keep any military secrets from each other and fully exchange military information, knowledge, and experience. "We live together as partners, and when necessary, we die together as partners. Other government agencies in both countries also have the closest ties. We have developed a system of cooperation based on peacetime experience, which we have repeatedly tested so that it can be implemented in wartime." Hore-Belisha solemnly stated that the cooperation between the two countries is not selfish or exclusive in any way and is prepared to help other countries whose independence is threatened. He then mentioned the British implementation of conscription, stating that the military department had medically examined the first batch of 50,000 conscripts and found that 97% of them were fit for military service. He asked, "Where is the basis for the accusation that we are decadent?" He also stated that the British army, including the regular army and supplemental troops, would reach more than one million within a year and would continue to increase. France possesses the largest army, while Britain possesses the largest navy. Moreover, in terms of production rate, both countries will possess the most modern and powerful air forces. Hore-Belisha concluded by saying, "Britain and France can mutually declare that we have the same thoughts, reach the same conclusions, and embrace the same ideals. We are close friends, we are strong, and we will always stand together."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] New Zealand Finance Minister Nash, who has arrived in Ireland, strongly denied foreign reports that he had declared that New Zealand would not send troops to participate when Britain became involved in the war. He said this evening at the Irish branch of the Association of Councils in Dublin, "I have never made such a statement, but only said that New Zealand may not join the treaty obligations of sending troops on expeditions. However, if New Zealand needs to rise up to defend democratic ideals, it will naturally participate. We have assumed the responsibility of defending New Zealand and the interests of the Empire in the South Pacific. When necessary, we will also rise up to defend the entire Empire."</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Key to Peace and War in Europe <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chang</p>
<p>Today, the countries of Europe are actively preparing for war. Although, on the surface, everything is peaceful, the underlying tension is known to everyone. According to recent news from various news agencies, German troops and munitions are being transported from East Prussia to Danzig. Nazi Party members are trying to organize volunteer corps in Danzig. The situation in Danzig has reached a very critical point. Although these reports have been denied by German officials, there is no smoke without fire. Europe today is filled with the smell of gunpowder, but in fact, there is no war. The well-known French political commentator Omanson recently commented on the European situation very appropriately; he said: "We are now living in a strange era, neither war nor peace. There is no peace because the activities of the Axis countries have forced most of the countries of Europe into a state of semi-mobilization, and millions of people are therefore horrified. There is no war because all crises have not yet reached an irreparable point, and in fact, no war has yet occurred."</p>
<p>The current situation in Europe is between war and peace. Under this condition, except for the actual outbreak of war, all weapons have been fully prepared; the army and navy have been partially mobilized to prevent accidents; the propaganda apparatus is even more active than usual. In reality, there has not yet been a formal military conflict, but psychological warfare exists at all times.</p>
<p>Germany has repeatedly stated that it does not want war. In the eyes of those who are not very familiar with the European situation, this must be a good phenomenon, the savior of peace. However, the internal reality is not that simple. Germany's goal is to have several more "Munichs," satisfying its desired desires without war.</p>
<p>The Germans are now concentrating all their efforts on dealing with the group of enemies in their minds. They believe that Poland's financial resources cannot indefinitely maintain a million-strong army, and that Britain and France will ultimately be unwilling to wage war in Eastern Europe. However, on the other hand, France has implemented permanent partial mobilization, Britain has adopted conscription, and the British and French navies have close cooperation in the Mediterranean. These are all clever moves in the world political chess game and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The current European situation seems to be a chess match in progress. Both sides are evenly matched and can support each other, so there will be no major changes. However, long-term optimism is probably not easy to achieve. The current transitional state cannot be maintained permanently.</p>
<p>Although the situation today is very tense, it is not like 1914. There is still an opportunity to save humanity from disaster. Both the collective and democratic blocs are willing to extend the current period of non-war but preparing for war, because war is a great risk. Chamberlain and Daladier understand this too well and have repeatedly retreated, sacrificing small countries and raising the arrogance of the aggressors; but do Hitler and Mussolini not know the dangers of war?</p>
<p>We can make a reasonable assumption about Germany's future actions: if Germany believes that an attack on Poland will trigger a major war in Europe, then it will not attack Poland, or at least it will have to wait for a more favorable time before taking action. Hitler is not stupid; he will choose a direction with less resistance. It is very likely that Germany will go after Spain, Hungary, or Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>In short, although the current situation is extremely urgent, there is no immediate risk of a major war. The real danger of war lies in one side having a mistaken assessment of the other side's strength and determination; at the same time, it believes that the other side is making rapid progress in national strength (including military, commercial, financial, economic, and industrial aspects) and that if it continues in the same way, it will inevitably become extremely powerful and inviolable. Therefore, rather than waiting for the future, it is better to fight now. This is where the danger of war lies, and it is also the key to peace and war in Europe.

<p>The British Aid China Movement will hold "China Week" on the second anniversary of "July 7th." The American China Week has already begun the day before yesterday. In Leningrad, the Soviet Union, a large-scale Chinese art exhibition is being enthusiastically prepared.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic development of this kind of movement, at the occasion of the second anniversary of the great War of Resistance of the Chinese nation, on the one hand, is sufficient to prove that our country's insistence on resisting the war for two years has increased its international status day by day, and the international community's sympathy and assistance for us have become increasingly widespread; on the other hand, it is sufficient to warn those elements who have begun to waver under the "anti-communist peace" conspiracy activities of the Japanese-puppet traitor Wang Jingwei, and it is sufficient to greatly enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of our entire nation.</p>
<p>Today, on the one hand, we must seize this international advantage, intensify the diplomatic work of the government and the people, promote a greater and more powerful aid-China movement, strengthen the democratic peace front against aggression, and on the other hand, we must intensify our efforts to combat and eliminate the traitor Wang Jingwei and his group of traitors and country-selling words and deeds, strengthen the unity and solidarity of the entire nation, strive to take the initiative in the comprehensive and protracted war for the final victory, and demonstrate to the people of the world that the Chinese nation is by no means able to be ruled by Japanese-puppet traitors, and demonstrate that the Chinese nation is worthy of being itself and worthy of being the mainstay of world justice and peace.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Aerial Bombing: Farewell! Airplanes and Bombs <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Not long ago, the great historian H.G. Wells, wrote an article in the "News Chronicle" entitled "The Uselessness of Airplane Bombs," talking about the power of the latest invention of aerial explosives.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, I am the inventor of aerial explosives, but I have bad luck. I have sought the Minister of National Defense Adjustment several times, requesting permission to conduct a public test, but have been rejected. Therefore, although I have invented it for a year, it has never come to the fore.</p>
<p>However, I will never be discouraged. I believe that one day, my aerial explosives will make a great splash on the battlefield. Now, let me do a little self-promotion, but every word I say is true.</p>
<p>My aerial bomb has an unusually simple structure: a lighter-than-air balloon, a small bomb, a fuse, a detonating wire, and a clock hand, costing only five shillings in total.</p>
<p>A not-too-large lighter-than-air balloon carries these four small things to the sky, where they float freely in the air. There are two ways to detonate the bomb. If an enemy airplane comes into contact with it, it will naturally perish together. Alternatively, you can set the clock hand to the detonation time, which can range from about one hour to twenty-four hours. When the time you set arrives, the detonating wire explodes first, the fuse is lit, and the bomb explodes. Everything is automatic, without you having to do much.</p>
<p>Naturally, it may not just happen to come into contact with an enemy airplane, but if you release a hundred of them, circling over your head, would the enemy airplanes still dare to come in?</p>
<p>For example, take London! If enemy airplanes come from Europe to attack, we can start releasing the lighter-than-air balloons one by one as soon as we know that they are crossing the English Channel.</p>
<p>It is best if the wind is calm, or there is a little west wind. The lighter-than-air balloons rise into the air and slowly drift eastward with the breeze. By the time the enemy airplane pilots see them, it will be too late to dodge! Coming from all directions, they are sure to shatter the enemies into pieces. The result will be ten thousand times more mythical than Japanese propaganda.</p>
<p>You may see that releasing lighter-than-air balloons one by one is very slow! That's not the case. Two ordinary novices can release two balloons per minute. In just half an hour, four thousand people can release 120,000 balloons!</p>
<p>The ascent of the lighter-than-air balloons is also unusually fast. Ordinarily, it takes thirty minutes to rise to 30,000 feet. Naturally, the speed of ascent is determined by the capacity of the gas. And you can also regulate the weight of the balloon so that it can stay in a certain height space, drifting for a full twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>When the wind is strong, naturally, it is a little more annoying, but it doesn't matter much. The balloons still rise and explode very quickly. As long as the position of the release is shifted a pole in the opposite direction of the wind, then when the wind blows the bombs to this place, they will explode with force.</p>
<p>You may think that with a large pile of bombs in the sky, won't the shattered iron hit the heads of the people below? Indeed, high-explosive shells have this problem. Now, there is nothing like that at all. All the bombs are made of light iron sheets. After they explode, they are all shattered and drift to the ground without any weight. Please rest assured that you will never have any trouble even if you don't wear a hat on your head.</p>
<p>Naturally, the most feared thing is the wind direction. For example, if the west wind suddenly turns to east wind shortly after the balloons are released, then that would be terrible! All the explosives will come back to your own camp. But that's just saying. After all, the wind will not change suddenly at any moment, and the most precise weather tests can predict the wind direction within twelve hours, so what is there to fear?</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the balloons really retreat to your own head, it doesn't matter. Anyway, we don't use airplanes ourselves, so just let them explode in the sky first! We can also watch a good fireworks display!</p>
<p>Having said so much about the advantages of aerial explosives, I have not yet said the best point, which is the saving of manpower. Pilots and anti-aircraft gunners are all saved, saving so many lives!</p>
<p>Releasing lighter-than-air balloons from below is very safe work, and the procedure is simple. Everyone can do it. It is also much easier to manufacture aerial explosives in factories than to build fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>Alright, do you fully understand? Let me tell you, one day, as Mr. Wells said, airplanes will disappear from the world. Watch my aerial explosives come to the fore.</p>

<p>There was a confused person in Suzhou who, one day, was cleaning out his desk when he found an invitation from last year. He looked at the date on it, which was exactly the current day, and hurriedly ordered the servant to prepare a sedan chair, change clothes, and put on a hat, preparing to go to pay respects. The people in his family explained to him in every possible way, but it was all in vain. He retorted, "Someone has sent an invitation, and it is not right not to go to pay respects." His mother had no choice but to tell the sedan carriers to carry him out of the front door and in through the back door. After a while, he indeed, respectfully, came in from the back door and bowed to his mother, congratulating her again and again. His wife, who was watching from the side, was both angry and amused. After finishing speaking, he left the back door and entered the front door, and saw his wife again, and said, "You are still at home. When I went to pay respects just now, I saw a woman in that house who looked just like you. Fortunately, I was still careful and didn't wrongly ask her questions. Otherwise, I would have mistaken someone, and it would have become a joke, and people would have really said that I was confused."</p>

<p>— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous Summary</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Chukes Shipping Company, and Shier, the mechanic, took a German ship to tour Europe. Because England and Germany declared war, British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then began to flee. It barely escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to American territory. Jack and Shier then returned to New York and met with Chukes. Chukes then asked them to take the "St. Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that this fellow was a German spy named Lavicky...</p>
<p>Twelve: Let Him Off Once</p>
<p>The next morning, when Jack and Bill came out, some of the passengers were quite agitated. In the distance at sea, they could see a large ship rapidly approaching from the west. As it drew closer, they could see clearly that it was a large ship with four smokestacks, painted black without any colored trim. The upper half of the hull was yellow, and the lower half was khaki.</p>
<p>There were many speculations and conjectures, but the truth quickly became clear. This was the former "Lusitania," now converted into a warship by the British government during wartime. This was evident from the gun emplacements installed on the fore and aft decks.</p>
<p>As she approached, her dull, somber paint exuded a fierce and stern aura.</p>
<p>"Stop the ship!"</p>
<p>A semaphore signal flew from her bow, and the same order came over the radio.</p>
<p>The "St. Mark" slowed its engines for the second time. Finally, the two large ships faced each other on the undulating sea, gently rocking, as if nodding. The small boat lowered from the "Lusitania" also swayed and wobbled over.</p>
<p>"Now is your chance to denounce old Lavicky," Bill reminded Jack as they leaned against the doorway of the radio room, watching.</p>
<p>"I still feel like this kind of behavior seems very despicable," Jack thought for a moment. "When the 'Lusitania' stopped, I was thinking about it, but—oh well, I think I'll let him off once."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you'll regret it later," Bill said. His words were somewhat prophetic.</p>
<p>The officers from the "Lusitania" didn't conduct a very thorough inspection because the "St. Mark" had already been inspected by the "Berwick." Since the German had already been taken away, all they had to do now was check the ship's papers. It didn't take long. In less than half an hour, the two ships exchanged salutes and separated again.</p>
<p>That afternoon, Mr. Johnson, a distinguished guest, arrived at Jack's radio room. He began the conversation with flattery.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I was too impetuous yesterday," he said. "I came specifically to apologize."</p>
<p>"That's fine," Jack said dismissively, wanting to dismiss Mr. Johnson's intentions.</p>
<p>"I—uh—perhaps I offered too little," he continued. "Now, I can promise you, if you are willing to send a telegram for me—of course, in code—I can double the amount I offered yesterday."</p>

<h3 id="e30">Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Miss Jack Cowper Fails in Semifinals; Men's Doubles Matches Extremely Tense; Our Player Fails in Qualifying Round <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Wimbledon Tennis Tournament featured the women's singles semifinals as the main event yesterday, the 4th. British player Miss Stanmers created a stunning victory, defeating Miss Jack Cowper (USA), who had a very high chance of winning the championship, in straight sets to enter the finals. Miss Stanmers' performance was extremely brilliant, launching a strong offensive with powerful smashes from the start in the first set. The opponent was unable to resist, and the final score was 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Two Beauties Defeat Polish and French Champions</p>
<p>The other two winning players were both from the United States. Miss Mabel defeated Polish champion Miss Jude Soski 6-1, 6-4, and Mrs. Van Pien defeated French champion Mrs. Madieu 6-4, 6-2.</p>
<p>The last match was between Mrs. Sperling (Denmark) and Miss Hardwick (England). Although Miss Hardwick's serves and baseline smashes were both excellent, she was still unable to break through the opponent's strong defense. The first set was 6-4, and the second set was 6-0.</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Tournament: Extremely Tense Situation</p>
<p>In the men's doubles, the match between the Yugoslavian team of Pansek and Mitik and the New Zealand team of Combs and McElflaw was extremely fierce. The entire match lasted two and a half hours, with the Yugoslavian team winning 7-9, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising results was the match between Olive Sayers (England) and McNeil and Smith (USA). The American team was expected to win, but the opposite happened. After five consecutive sets of fierce fighting, the British team finally won 6-8, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>Borotra Team Enters Finals Week</p>
<p>The famous French doubles players Borotra and Brown defeated the British team of Old Collins and Dinkler 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to enter the finals.</p>
<p>The American team of Corky and Wex eliminated the British team of Gausel and Hewar in straight sets 6-3, 6-1, 6-3. The other British team, Bopler and McPheil, eliminated the Argentine team of Aierque and Rosel 6-4, 6-3, 13-11.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Tournament: Strong American Hope</p>
<p>The results of the fourth week of the mixed doubles are as follows:</p>
<p>Gugujewich (Yugoslavia) and Mrs. Madieu (France) defeated Dunaneford and Miss Climan (England) 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Riggs and Mabel (USA) defeated Morigan and Miss Kayan (England) 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>McNeil (USA) and Mrs. Stanmers (England) defeated Pansek and Miss Fralin (Yugoslavia) 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Corky and Mrs. Van Pien (USA) defeated Belinton and Miss Ingram (England) 6-2, 6-2.</p>
<p>Keegan and Mrs. Mullan Misto (Belgium) defeated Elmer and Weaver (Luxembourg) 6-2, 6-3.</p>
<p>Qualifying Round Begins: Both He Fail</p>
<p>He Renxuan, our player who was eliminated in the first week, participated in the qualifying round. He had a bye in the first week, and in the second week, he lost to Woodhull of England 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second week of the women's competition, Miss He Aiying of our country lost to Miss Betty 6-3, 7-5. Miss He made many mistakes in this match. Although she once led 4-2 in the second set, she ultimately failed to maintain her advantage. [Note: This competition is a match between those who were eliminated in the first two weeks of the Wimbledon tournament.]</p>

<h3 id="e33">"New Gymnastics": Movements and Exercises <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>After reading the article "A Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics" in this newspaper, most people may have gained some understanding of "New Gymnastics." However, since that article compared "New Gymnastics" with "Old Gymnastics," it only provided a general description of its movements and exercises. Those who have never practiced this type of gymnastics may still have questions about what specific movements and exercises "New Gymnastics" entails. Therefore, this article aims to provide a more detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Before describing the movements and exercises, there are some necessary clarifications:</p>
<p>Although these movements and exercises are based on those of Mr. Wu Zhongou of Zhongda University, they also incorporate some of the author's own opinions, which may differ slightly from Mr. Wu's. However, the differences should not be too significant.</p>
<p>"New Gymnastics" is a fusion of new and old gymnastics movements from Europe and the United States. It embodies principles such as "lively," "dynamic," "high volume," and "high effectiveness." If the movements of "Old Gymnastics" do not contradict these principles, they can be used in "New Gymnastics." This article only describes the movements that differ from Old Gymnastics.</p>
<p>To save space, if the exercises for various movements are similar and can be explained with one example, only one example will be provided. Otherwise, the names of the movements will be listed. Only those that require individual explanation will be explained in detail.</p>
<p>In "New Gymnastics," there must be a position first, then a movement. Unless otherwise specified for lower limb movements, the starting position is usually a semi-open stance.</p>
<p>Muscle regulation is highly valued in New Gymnastics to prevent muscles from becoming stiff and rigid. In most movements, muscle tension must be followed by relaxation. For example, in the "swing" movement, the muscles tense during the swing and relax when the movement reaches a certain point. In the "strike" movement, the muscles tense during the strike and relax upon retraction. The same principle applies to other movements. Some movements, such as "vibration," are too fast and forceful to allow for muscle relaxation during the movement. In such cases, relaxation exercises can be added after completing a section of gymnastics.</p>
<p>This article should be read in conjunction with "A Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics" for a clearer understanding of the exercises in "New Gymnastics."</p>
<p>Many movements may have been omitted. It is hoped that there will be opportunities to supplement them in the future.</p>
<p>1.  "Swing" Movements: This is one of the most important upper limb movements in New Gymnastics, emphasizing liveliness and naturalness. Each swing should involve a rapid mid-section movement to tense the muscles, followed by a gradual slowdown at a certain point to relax the muscles. The lower limbs can freely flex and extend or rise on the toes following the momentum of the upper limb swing.</p>
<p>(1) Separate Left and Right Swing: The arms separate left and right from a crossed position in front of the body and swing to a certain point before swinging back to the crossed position in front of the body. There is also a "Separate Left and Right Back Swing," which is similar to this movement, except that when swinging back, the arms cross in front of the face, with each hand reaching for the opposite shoulder blade. The arms then swing downward and backward when extending.</p>
<p>(2) Same-Side Left and Right Swing: With both arms raised or one arm raised to the right, the arms swing simultaneously to the right or left. When swinging to the left, the right foot can be lifted onto the toes, and vice versa.</p>
<p>(3) Front and Back Swing: The arms swing forward and backward from a drooping position. The knees can flex and extend once with each swing. There are two variations: simultaneous swing and alternating swing (one forward, one backward).</p>
<p>(4) Separate "Figure-8" Swing: The arms separate from a crossed position in front of the chest, swinging downward, backward, upward, and laterally to cross above the head, then immediately return to the chest, separating and swinging again. Each arm traces a "Figure-8" shape on the front side of the body. Each time the arms cross, the arm in front should be switched.</p>

<p>— Gu Sifan</p>
<p>One day, two girls moved into the room next to my friend Qi's. The older one was gentle and dignified, and the younger one had bangs and was lively and interesting. They used door panels to make beds and surrounded the beds with sheets to create curtains. A handsome young man with a very elegant demeanor, a friend of theirs, slept on a straw mat on the floor. They were all students from the Zhejiang Youth Wartime Work Corps. The two girls had been sent from the provincial capital to Yuqian County, on the border of Zhejiang. The young man had escorted them there, and after staying for a day or two, he was preparing to go to the Suchang area. He was an intelligence agent for the New Fourth Army in the occupied territories.</p>
<p>They loved to laugh, make noise, and sing, almost without stopping. They made a ruckus one night, but the next morning, they had disappeared to who-knows-where. When we got up, it was quiet as anything outside. We walked past their room and saw the floor covered in straw dust, peanut shells, and a few books scattered around: "Popular Philosophy," "Village in August," "Literary Front." Qi's wife laughed and said:</p>
<p>"What kind of mess is this?"</p>
<p>"A doghouse," I jokingly replied.</p>
<p>Qi seemed to remember something and said:</p>
<p>"The younger one is like Lulu, with the same bangs and liveliness. Just hearing her Hangzhou accent makes me think of Lulu when she was little."</p>
<p>"Why don't I think so?" I said.</p>
<p>"Because you met her in Shanghai when she was already grown up."</p>
<p>Yes, at that time, she was already a teacher to many children. And we only met a few times before parting. It has been almost three years since then. Last autumn, I went from Shanghai to Changsha and passed through Jinhua. I learned that she had gotten married, and I unexpectedly saw a photo of her husband, who was also my friend. Five years ago, when I was studying at a middle school on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, he was the school's registrar. Later, his relationship with a young female teacher fell apart, and he left the school. No one knew where he had gone.</p>
<p>This spring, I passed through Jinhua again, and friends told me that they had separated soon after getting married. Lulu had joined the New Fourth Army's training camp, and her husband had joined the guerrillas in the south. But now, Lulu was about to graduate, and he had died in an enemy ambush. She wrote a letter to her friends in Jinhua:</p>
<p>"I don't believe it's true. Is it really true? ... Give me the courage to live on:..."</p>
<p>I told Qi about this, and Qi also wrote a letter to comfort her:</p>
<p>"I heard that you are grieving over your misfortune. I feel the need to write to you because I am one of your old friends. Your grief will soon be overcome, just like others who have experienced the same changes. People have both passion and reason. They can be excited and calm. What's more, a great task lies before you!"</p>
<p>But I believe that Lulu will be able to leave her ruined home, wearing a military cotton coat, and wander in unfamiliar places, like Lulu, who is accustomed to being pampered, also able to leave her ruined home and wander in unfamiliar places.</p>
<p>I soon left Yuqian.</p>
<p>On the eve of leaving Yuqian, we drank too much wine. We turned off the lights, but no one could sleep. Qi was very excited, reciting Du Fu's poem: "Tomorrow separated by mountains, the affairs of the world are both vast and hazy."</p>
<p>"When will you come again?" Qi's wife asked.</p>
<p>"If the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway isn't cut off, I'll be back in half a year," I replied.</p>
<p>"Don't believe him!" Qi shouted wildly: "Guangxi is three thousand miles away from here! And even if he comes, will we still be in Yuqian? By then, we will have long since gone to who-knows-where!"</p>
<p>No one spoke anymore. Outside the window, the valley was bathed in melancholy moonlight.</p>
<p>Outside, they were making noise again. The two girls were laughing, and the young man was shouting, "My eldest daughter! My youngest daughter!"</p>
<p>Qi's wife couldn't help but laugh and say:</p>
<p>"Listen to them! What a 'precious father'!"</p>
<p>As the laughter subsided, they began to sing the tragic "Parting Song." The last two lines:</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye, classmates!</p>
<p>We'll meet again on the front lines!</p>
<p>It was easy to bring tears to one's eyes.</p>
<p>The next morning, it was quiet outside again, but when we walked past that house, the situation was completely different: the floor was swept clean, and the straw mat was gone. He was gone.</p>
<h3 id="e37">A Bundle of Wild Grass <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Overture</p>
<p>Loneliness teaches people to ponder, solitude makes people imagine more. In the deep of night, listening to the ticking of the clock, I casually jot down these fragmented thoughts.</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>First, I thought of time. What a difficult thing to grasp! (Where does it come from, and where does it go?) A champion of aestheticism said: "Time robs you of the roses of your youth." Others said, "Don't go to clock shops, hear your youth being gnawed away." Thus, people tremble with fear in the face of time, worrying that rosy cheeks will turn into white hair.</p>
<p>"How many possibilities are there in a second?" Who knows? I don't seek a mystical answer, like some kind of hidden hand pulling the strings of fate. Friends, be careful, you will see the changes that time brings to people. There are too many.</p>
<p>The children we remember have already learned about love; the lively people have already walked into the grave. Look at our motherland! How is she surpassing time in this race against time and progressing rapidly?</p>
<p>That's right. This is exactly what I wanted to say. Don't be afraid, and don't tremble even more. Seize it, and complete the work we should do.</p>
<p>Happiness</p>
<p>"Happiness is sometimes very close to people, so close that it can be touched with a reach, but people still lose it." I can't forget this sentence for a long time. Happiness often wanders in the wilderness, unable to find a patron.</p>
<p>I also often remember the embarrassed faces of those being teased in the midst of loud laughter. People are accustomed to building their own happiness on the suffering of others, saying that they have found happiness. But alas, the answer is negative.</p>
<p>Happiness is not selfish. In this turbulent era, there is no personal happiness, everything is attached to the nation. Abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial, working for one's own benefit will not succeed.</p>
<p>Happiness will fall upon the children of the motherland.</p>

<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>—The Story of a Girl—</p>
<p>People all stood up, collecting their belongings. They originally didn't have much, so they leaned out of the window, looking to see if anyone had come to welcome them. Sure enough, in the crowded mass of people, they saw a white flag that read, “Welcome Comrades ××.” They quickly waved toward that direction, as if the people over there had also seen them and were squeezing over toward them. Just at that moment, a strange whistle sounded. Immediately, people seemed to be completely overturned. Women screamed in shrill voices, children were pushed and cried, and the white flag disappeared. The crowd was like mad creatures, rushing, colliding, without order or reason. Some people were pushed down below the platform, and even the railway police maintaining order ran away in panic.</p>
<p>They were simply stunned. It was still that young man, who happened not to have gone down either, who told them that this was an air raid alert and led them down from the back of the train.</p>
<p>“We can't wait here. The station is the target. Let's run away quickly.”</p>
<p>He jumped down first, and Jingwen followed. As she jumped, the train moved, and she fell to the ground. But she quickly got up and ran toward the outside of the tracks.</p>
<p>The train was pulled away by the frantic locomotive, leaving behind the entire frantic platform. Everyone rushed toward the exit, all crammed at the gate. The station worker waved a red flag and blew a copper whistle, but it was of no use. Some in the crowd saw them howling and running over, and immediately, many people followed, running toward the fields.</p>
<p>Before they had run far, the siren suddenly sounded again. It was different from before, short and rapid, as if gasping for breath. The young man then said to them:</p>
<p>“We can’t run too far anymore. Everyone scatter and lie on the ground.”</p>
<p>Qingyan listened to his words, ran another seven or eight steps, and lay down on the ground; but the young man instructed as if giving an order:</p>
<p>“Not like that. Lie on your back, with both hands flat under your head.” (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>—The Story of the Old Grandmother—</p>
<p>Due to Qian Asen's notification, the threshing ground suddenly became busy. Qian Asen said that Li Jingen had told him last night that "they" would be passing through this place today on a rural "search."</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan, leading us, was helping in the old grandmother's threshing. Upon hearing the news, he gathered us to discuss countermeasures. Because "they" were numerous, eighty or ninety people, we decided, according to custom, not to confront "them" head-on, but to temporarily scatter to the Qin Mountains behind.</p>
<p>"Okay," the old grandmother said, wiping the sweat from her forehead, "You go. I'll take care of everything here. When they come and go, you can come down the mountain and return."</p>
<p>"How will we know when 'they' come and go?" asked Captain Wang.</p>
<p>"Just watch for smoke rising from the threshing ground; that means 'they' have come. When the smoke stops, that means 'they' have gone." She then said to her son and daughter-in-law, "You go too. It's enough for A Ming to stay with me." A Ming was her grandson.</p>
<p>While Captain Wang was supervising us to pack up in the house, the old grandmother's family and Qian Asen were all gathering the wheat stalks and broken wheat straw on the threshing ground and piling them up in the southwest corner of the ground.</p>
<p>We went up the mountain, Qian Asen also returned to Qingzhen, and only the old grandmother and A Ming were left on the threshing ground.</p>
<p>We set up sentries at the foot of the mountain, and most of the people hid in the woods on the mountainside. Everyone readied their weapons, preparing for "them" to rush up.</p>
<p>Li Jingen, not far from leaving Wangjia Village, ran into "them" and was questioned, searched, and beaten by "them," but fortunately, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>The old grandmother saw "them" gradually entering the village and went to light the pile of wheat husks, letting it burn.</p>
<p>It seemed that someone among "them" was issuing orders, that for this small village, they should also fulfill "their" responsibility for going to the countryside. So a small group of people entered the houses to "search," and most of the people sat down under the trees to rest.</p>
<p>"Hey, old woman," one of "them," wearing a white cloth shirt and pants, called out to the old grandmother, "Come here, I want to ask you something."</p>
<p>The old grandmother, dragging a willow flail in her hand, walked over. A Ming followed behind her. They both looked calm. Even though someone had entered their house, they didn't seem to pay any attention.</p>
<p>"What is it?" The old grandmother wiped her sweat with the corner of her clothes.</p>
<p>"Do you have a guerrilla team here?"</p>
<p>"'Oil and beans' every family fries."</p>
<p>"It's not about 'beans.' I'm asking if you have any 'bandits' here."</p>
<p>"There have never been local bandits here, only robbers from outside."</p>
<p>"Where are the robbers?"</p>
<p>"They don't live here; they come and go."</p>
<p>"What do they rob?"</p>
<p>"Whatever they see, even people."</p>
<p>She talked nonsense with that person for a while. Seeing that nothing was happening, she went back to threshing wheat.</p>
<p>The people who had entered the house to "search" did not come out, and more people followed them in. The person wearing white cloth pants seemed a bit bored, so he stood up and looked around. He caught sight of the burning pile of wheat husks and called out to the grandmother again, saying:</p>
<p>"Hey, old woman, come here, I still want to ask you something."</p>
<p>The old grandmother pretended not to hear and ignored him.</p>
<p>"Hey, old woman, what are you burning there?" He walked over, looking somewhat amiable.</p>
<p>The old grandmother said casually, "Burning red-banded snakes there!"</p>
<p>"Red-banded snakes? Where did the red-banded snakes come from?" He clearly wanted to find something to talk about.</p>
<p>"I don't know where the red-banded snakes came from!" The old grandmother rested the flail and said. "But they're definitely not from around here, because we've never had them here, only recently found them."</p>
<p>"How big are they?" He, like most people, was very fond of talking about snakes.</p>
<p>"How could they not be big? The big ones are like arms, the small ones like fingers."</p>
<p>"How many are there?"</p>
<p>"How could there not be many? Sometimes dozens, sometimes one or two, they often appear. It's said that in some places, they're found in the thousands!"</p>
<p>"Has anyone been bitten to death?"</p>

<h3 id="e41">Emergency Blackout Drill Scheduled for the End of the Month, Time to Be Determined. Chiang Kai-shek Publicly Demonstrates Methods for Extinguishing Incendiary Bombs. Locally Made Gas Masks Still Awaiting Testing. <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Air Defense Authority, in the past, to test residents' understanding of air defense and whether they can effectively comply with the regulations, has held several blackout drills. However, the results have been declining. For this reason, the authorities had intended to continue holding an emergency blackout drill last month, but it was temporarily suspended due to circumstances. According to sources, this emergency blackout drill has now been scheduled for the end of this month, and the date has been chosen. However, the date will not be announced beforehand to allow residents to prepare in advance. It is hoped that all air defense equipment, such as air raid shelter light bulbs and lampshades, etc., will be prepared in advance so that they can be mobilized immediately after the alarm is issued, and not be arranged temporarily, which would affect the results. Air Defense Commissioner Shi Xiangjian also stated that a batch of incendiary bombs will be shipped from England to Hong Kong for experimentation. In the future, instructions will be given to the public in various parts of Hong Kong on how to extinguish them so that they will not be at a loss when dealing with them in the future. According to Commissioner Shi's opinion, residents should not leave their homes lightly during air raids. Even if it is considered necessary to leave, someone should be left to guard the house, as it is feared that incendiary bombs will enter the room and, if not rescued in time, will cause a prairie fire. Regarding the issue of locally made gas masks, Commissioner Shi stated that although masks are manufactured in Hong Kong, none have been provided to the government for testing. The Hong Kong government is eager to promote this industry and has notified several factories to submit samples of filters to the government for testing. If they are deemed satisfactory, the government will purchase them.</p>

<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The Hong Kong Amateur Friendship Society, because the soldiers at the front were fighting valiantly and victory was in sight, felt that the compatriots in Hong Kong had an unshirkable responsibility to support the war of resistance with money. Therefore, a "July 7th" donation campaign was specially held, and the details were reported in the previous newspaper. The society's donation teams were divided into nineteen teams, each with a captain and four members. Since the launch of the donation campaign, each team has been working hard with the spirit of a "commando team achievement competition" to publish their results and make a splash. Their tense and lively spirit of serving the country in their spare time is truly admirable. The society held a meeting last night to report the donation results of each team, and the total amount was 2,504.49 yuan in national currency, 4,650.28 yuan in Hong Kong dollars, plus US dollars, Vietnamese currency, Guizhou currency, and gold rings, totaling more than 13,000 yuan in national currency, exceeding the original plan by more than six times. The teams with excellent results are listed below: Champion Team Zhang Wenxian, members Jin Zhongtao, Yang Hui, Wei Jinlin, 1,167.9 Hong Kong dollars, 222.405 yuan in national currency, 1 US dollar, 2 Vietnamese currency; Second Place He Jingbo Team, 565 Hong Kong dollars, 5 yuan in national currency; Third Place Shi Xuanxin Team, 269.2 Hong Kong dollars, 525 yuan in national currency; Fourth Place Wu Runwu Team 281.4 Hong Kong dollars, 193.54 yuan in national currency, 2 gold rings, 105 pairs of cloth shoes; Fifth Place Bei Zuyuan Team, 250.9 Hong Kong dollars, 197 yuan in national currency.

<h3 id="e43">"July 7th" Expanded Bond Purchase Campaign Week. From Today to the 13th. The National Salvation Bond Branch Urges Overseas Chinese to Actively Purchase Bonds. <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Branch of the National Salvation Bond Campaign Committee held a regular meeting yesterday and resolved to take advantage of the "July 7th" anniversary to promote the active purchase of bonds by various overseas Chinese groups so that the 10 million yuan bond quota can be fully subscribed as soon as possible. This shows our overseas Chinese compatriots' love for the motherland and their faith in supporting the war of resistance. Yesterday, a letter was also issued to all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, urging them to make efforts to subscribe. The original letter said, "Commemorating July 7th, please purchase bonds." From the smoke of gunfire, an independent, free, dignified, and brilliant New China will surely be created. This is the greatness of July 7th, and it is worth the solemn commemoration of compatriots across the country. Now, as the second anniversary of July 7th approaches, all our Hong Kong compatriots are enthusiastically commemorating it, either by selling flowers, selling flags, eating vegetarian food, or saving money, making various meaningful expressions, which fully demonstrate the patriotic enthusiasm of our overseas Chinese compatriots, which is admirable. However, in order for our national government to concentrate its financial resources to make overall plans as originally planned, a "July 7th Expanded Bond Purchase Campaign Week" is specially scheduled from the 6th to the 13th of this month. Fellow overseas Chinese compatriots are invited to actively purchase bonds during the two weeks so that the amount of 10 million yuan can be fully subscribed as soon as possible. The sawmills and merchants have already subscribed for 10,000 yuan, and the Inn Industry United Chamber of Commerce and the Butchers' Guild Shouyi Hall have each subscribed for 50 yuan, taking the lead in practice. It is believed that other organizations and fellow overseas Chinese compatriots will not give way and will act bravely, and will surely follow suit and not allow others to monopolize the beauty of being first. Respectfully, the Hong Kong Branch of the National Salvation Public Bond Raising Committee, Director Zheng Chiru, Deputy Director Li Xingqu, July 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e47">A Murder for Money Occurred in Tai Hang, Hong Kong Yesterday Morning. He Qiong, a Wealthy Widow Who Returned from Overseas, Was Found Strangled in Her Building. <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>At 1 Chong Shek Road, Tai Hang Village, Causeway Bay, on the second floor, a 60-year-old woman named He Yinggui, also known as He Qiong and He Qigu, a native of Shunde, born in San Francisco, USA, was murdered in her home late last night. It was not until 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning that a water carrier discovered her, seeing Ms. He lying on the floor with a coolie's towel-like object around her neck, her hands tied behind her back with a towel, and her feet tied with a black belt. The deceased was wearing black cloth pants and a gray cloth vest, with a pink woman's shirt on her left shoulder. Her mouth was also tightly stuffed with cloth. When she was discovered, the deceased's body was already cold and had been dead for a long time. After the water carrier discovered her, she went to the police station to report the case. After receiving the report, the police station sent detectives to the scene to investigate. The deceased's body was immediately taken to the mortuary for an autopsy in a hearse.</p>
<p>Living Alone, Renting the Entire Building</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the deceased lived alone on the second floor of 1 Chong Shek Road. She moved in four years ago, renting the entire floor for 20 yuan a month. Ms. He only lived alone and had no relatives living with her. Occasionally, relatives and friends from Macau would visit, but they would come and go quickly and rarely stay for long. The deceased's residence was very simple. The furnishings upstairs were also very simple. Besides an iron bed and a five-bucket cabinet, there was nothing else. All the clothes, bedding, and all daily necessities were piled up on the bed. The deceased usually took care of all the household chores herself. Because the building had no water pipe equipment, water was supplied by a Hakka woman who carried it up every morning between 8:30 and 9:00. Yesterday morning, the case was discovered by the water carrier.</p>
<p>Sparkling Gold Jewelry, Tempting People</p>
<p>The deceased was wealthy and had many properties in Cheung Chau, New Territories. She also had a large amount of money deposited in the Bank of East Asia. She usually wore sparkling gold jewelry when she went out, and when she bought things, she always used silver dollars or 50 yuan banknotes for change. Perhaps this was why she was coveted by bandits. When the detectives went upstairs to investigate after the deceased was killed, they found that the five-bucket cabinet had been searched in an abnormally messy manner. According to the deceased's godson, Guan Quan, who reported to the police, the deceased had a lot of cash stored in the house in addition to the property she had purchased and the money she had deposited in the bank, as well as gold bars and other jewelry. However, when the police searched, the above-mentioned gold jewelry and money were gone. It is heard that the deceased married a local overseas Chinese as a concubine in the Americas many years ago and returned to Hong Kong to live together, bringing with her more than 70,000 yuan, so her life was quite prosperous. The deceased's first wife and her children and grandchildren lived in the countryside and rarely came to Hong Kong. The deceased also had an older brother who ran a chicken and duck stall at a certain number in the upper district, which was quite large. The deceased had purchased insurance worth more than 100,000 yuan from a certain life insurance company in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Police Investigation, Suspected Murder</p>
<p>The deceased was a gambler and especially liked mahjong. She usually returned home late at night, often between 11 p.m., and sometimes even invited her friends back home to chat until 1 or 2 a.m. It was seen that the deceased was alone in a restaurant nearby around 10 p.m. After leaving the restaurant, her whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, it is believed that when the woman returned home, it was late at night, and she was followed by bandits who sneaked into the building and committed the crime. Currently, the police authorities, in view of the seriousness of the case, have stepped up their investigation. It is heard that after the Liao case occurred, a woman went to see the deceased, claiming to be her sister. The police have summoned her to the police station for questioning. It is generally speculated that the case is a murder for money. The perpetrator coveted the deceased's wealth and therefore committed the crime.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Continued Trial of the Murder Case in Li Yuan East Street. Tan Song Testifies on the Arrest of the Bandit. Held for Third Trial at 3 PM Today. <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The suspect in the robbery and murder case in Li Yuan East Street, Liu Wenzhu, continued to be interrogated by Central Magistrate Yi Huashi yesterday afternoon. First, Tan Song, the Chinese detective No. 623, who bravely captured the defendant on the day of the incident, testified. He said that at about 11:30 a.m. on the same day, he and Chinese detective Yin Wen No. 612 were patrolling near No. 27 Li Yuan East Street when they suddenly heard a gunshot. They then saw three men, two wearing suits and one wearing Chinese clothing, walking towards Des Voeux Road. The defendant was one of them. He signaled Yin to chase after them. Yin heard the signal and pursued the man in Chinese clothing, while he approached the defendant. In an instant, he suddenly heard a loud bang. He looked to the left and saw Yin Wen covering his abdomen and slowly falling down. At that time, the defendant and the other person had passed him. Seeing this, he stepped onto the sidewalk in front of No. 5, only four shops away from the defendant and the other person. He then fired at them, chasing them for more than half a street when he fired another shot. At the intersection of Li Yuan East Street and Des Voeux Road, the person in the blue clothes fired several shots at him. He then fired a third shot. At this time, the defendant and the other person turned to the left and ran along the arcade of Des Voeux Road. He followed closely behind them and fired two more shots when they reached the intersection of Pottinger Street, and sounded the whistle to call for reinforcements. The person in the blue clothes also fell to the ground in response. He then abandoned him and pursued the defendant alone, firing the last bullet. When he reached the intersection of China Street, he crossed the tram tracks and fled towards Victoria Street. When he reached No. 77, he was blocked by a rickshaw. He then turned towards the stone pillar. At that time, he had caught up and hit him on the head with his gun, grabbing his collar. He looked back and saw him, and immediately put his hand into his pocket. He then gripped his hand tightly. At this time, a policeman and an Indian policeman had arrived one after another and helped to subdue the defendant. He was still struggling hard. He then hit him on the forehead with his gun, and he fell to the ground. The Indian policeman then picked up a gun from the ground, which contained five bullets. After the British officer who tested the weapons finished testifying, the judge ordered that the trial be continued this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e49">"China Salvation" About to Leave the Country. Last Performance Before Departure. In Response to the Enthusiastic Invitation of All Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Reception Performance for Three Days Starting Tonight. <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The China Salvation Drama Troupe is about to leave the country for propaganda work. In response to the special invitation of the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, they held the 746th large-scale charity performance at the Lee Theatre from the 1st to the 3rd to raise funds for the association to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees. The performance of the great famous dramas "By the Yongding River" and "The Earth's Calamity" was a complete success. This charity performance was originally the troupe's last charity performance before leaving the country. However, due to fundraising reasons, the ticket prices were not popularized to the public and the number of seats was limited, and many people were unable to attend. Therefore, during the charity performance, they received letters and telegrams from various community organizations and schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon, requesting that they continue to hold reception performances to promote publicity. The troupe, feeling that it was difficult to refuse with enthusiasm, and due to the ship schedule, still had several days to stay in Hong Kong, so it was specifically scheduled to continue the 747th reception performance for three consecutive days at the Lee Theatre, with the great famous drama "The Light of Southern Shandong" performed at the night show tonight, "By the Yongding River" performed at the day and night shows tomorrow "July 7th", and "The Light of Southern Shandong" performed at the day and night shows on the 8th. The ticket prices are only set at three kinds of one dime, two dimes, and four dimes, in order to popularize it. After this public performance, they will leave for the Philippines and then the United States. Overseas Chinese compatriots who want to appreciate the highest level of dramatic art at the current stage should seize this last opportunity to reserve seats as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e51">A Street Fight Occurred in Wellington Street Last Night. More Than a Dozen Men Held Sharp Weapons. Six People Injured After a Long Fight. <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>At about 9 o'clock last night, at the intersection of Wellington Street and Pottinger Street, more than a dozen men suddenly had a conflict for unknown reasons. The two sides fought each other and drew sharp weapons as weapons. The momentum was fierce, and the crowd was noisy for a while, and the order was disrupted. Pedestrians fled in all directions, and some shops closed their doors for fear of being vandalized. The dozen or so men were entangled in front of the Fu An Factory at No. 45 on the street for a long time. Because both sides had weapons, several people were injured before long. Two of them fell to the ground, blood gushing out of their faces and staining the ground. Some passers-by nearby saw that the situation was not good and sounded the whistle to report to the police. At that time, the reserve policemen No. 30 and No. 100 who were on duty at the post heard the police and immediately telegraphed the police station to report. After receiving the report, the Central Police Station sent a large number of detectives led by the Chinese and Western inspectors to the scene to suppress the situation. When the detectives arrived, they heard that the fighters had fled in all directions, and only six injured people were lying in blood. Among them, two were seriously injured and fell in front of the Fu An Shoe Factory. Their abdomens and limbs were all cut by knives, and they were unconscious. After the detectives arrived, they first took care of the injured and searched the streets for the rest of the gang. The detectives then summoned the ambulance to the scene and first sent the injured to the Marie Hospital for treatment. A short knife sheath was found at the scene, which was probably left by the criminals. After the six injured people were sent to the hospital, two of them were unable to testify due to their unconscious state. The other four spoke with a Northern River accent and resembled stable boys. As of 12 o'clock last night, the police were still investigating. More than a dozen men from Shanghai and Shandong near D'Aguilar Street were taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Rumor: National Currency Price Has Recovered to County Standards, Legal Exchange Rate Set at Seven Pence, Trade Export Exchange Settlement Control to Be Implemented Soon <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The legal tender of our country was originally set at a standard exchange rate of 14.25 pence per yuan, equivalent to slightly more than 9.5 dimes in Hong Kong dollars. However, with the outbreak of war, the number of excess imports increased significantly, leading to the emergence of a black market and a decline in the value of the legal tender. To balance foreign exchange, our financial authorities continued to calculate foreign exchange purchases for merchants at the legal exchange rate, resulting in a significant monthly burden, with speculators benefiting the most. Moreover, the × people issued counterfeit currency in the occupied areas to absorb legal tender and transport it to Shanghai, thereby acquiring our country's foreign exchange. Although × country's business community suffered first, even restricting its exports to China in North China, because our country's merchants were unwilling to use counterfeit currency, and immediately exchanged it for goods once received, our country's financial system was inevitably affected. To counter their acquisition of foreign exchange, the Bank of China stopped listing rates last month, temporarily suspending acceptance of merchants' foreign exchange applications, with the exception of necessary expenditures related to the current situation. In other words, the legal exchange rate of 14.25 pence was abolished. At the beginning of its implementation, the legal tender market saw considerable fluctuations, and × even spread rumors that our reserve fund was exhausted. However, knowledgeable people knew that our country had sufficient funds and solid credit. Nevertheless, to cope with the × people's acquisition of foreign exchange, this move was necessary. As expected, it soon stabilized and even rose sharply several times. Conversely, the price of the × started to follow the legal tender. Financial circles expected the financial authorities to find a suitable level in the market and re-establish the legal exchange rate for the national currency. Yesterday, it was heard that friendly countries had decided to continue their support for our financial problems as agreed, with no intention of changing. At the same time, we also decided to control export prices and prohibit the import of non-essential goods to strengthen our war resistance financial resources, with perfect measures in place. Therefore, the re-establishment of the legal rate, with each yuan equivalent to seven pence in British currency, is particularly urgent to implement the "export exchange settlement" method. Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China resumed listing rates, announcing the legal tender exchange rate as above. Merchants can apply to the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange at this rate, and foreign exchange obtained by export merchants must also be sold to the government in accordance with the exchange settlement method. However, this news has not yet been confirmed by the Bank of China. Last night, the legal tender market rate fluctuated to 5.29 Hong Kong dollars, which is also equivalent to 6.5 to 6.25 pence in British currency, still slightly lower than the legal exchange rate.</p>

There were 16 teams from the school's English night school and 4 teams from the Chinese middle school, totaling 20 teams, each with three members, accompanied by representatives from the Women's War Relief Association. They traveled under the scorching heat, which was extremely commendable. Fortunately, the authorities of each school, concerned about the country and the nation, enthusiastically accepted the national flag and strived for final victory, which further inspired the team members to exert their remaining energy and return to school late at night. The results were excellent. According to the team leader, Li Zhong, and the deputy team leader, Chen Junfu, the participating in the flag donation campaign and receiving enthusiastic acceptance and encouragement from various schools was extremely exciting. The detailed amount will be sent to the Women's War Relief Association this morning to be opened in public and published in the newspaper to demonstrate great trust.</p>

<h3 id="e60">A Tour of Fudan Middle School <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong branch of Fudan Middle School held a graduation ceremony for senior and junior high school students and an achievement exhibition at the school. The reporter took this opportunity to run to Fudan Middle School, which had escaped from the clutches of the × people and reopened in Fanling, for a tour.</p>
<p>A little more than an hour's drive took people from the bustling city to the countryside, to Fanling. After getting off the car, walking along the Pak Chi Road, flanked by rice paddies, the rice fields in July, laden with heavy grains, were a tender yellow. Green trees and wildflowers intertwined to form a natural beauty. Not far away, one could see the majestic figure of Fudan Middle School standing beside it.</p>
<p>Outside the school gate, a bright and magnificent national flag was raised high, fluttering in the wind. This perfectly complemented the joy in the hearts of the students in the school. After gathering and singing the national anthem, the graduation ceremony began. The principal earnestly exhorted the graduating students, followed by congratulatory speeches from the representatives of the senior and junior second grades, and finally a reply from the graduates. In the evening, there was also a entertainment program, with a performance of the play "Process" to add to the fun and welcome the guests.</p>
<p>Before the exhibition opened, the reporter inspected the crystallization of the students' hard work. The small room with a long area had walls neatly lined with students' history and geography achievements. The library, the animal and plant specimen room, the physics and chemistry instrument room, and the anatomy room were all arranged with very rich equipment. Many of these instruments were bought from the United States by Mr. Li Taichu and rescued from Guangzhou.</p>
<p>In the school's pavilion, the reporter talked with the person in charge of the school about their painstaking management. The beauty of the school's environment and the various facilities really make it a very perfect middle school.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent of the students there are boarders. The fees charged are only HK$110 per semester for senior high school boys and girls, and HK$100 per semester for junior high school boys and girls. These fees are not considered expensive compared to the original schools in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In addition to working hard on the textbooks, the students in the school are even more active in extra-curricular research. There are now journalism research societies, speech research societies, morning art research societies, history and geography research societies, history, geography, and chemistry research societies, physics and chemistry research societies, and physical education and national arts research societies, so that they can develop their research spirit in their own way.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to enrich the summer life, the school has specially organized a summer reading club. In addition to the guidance of all the teachers of the school, academic celebrities are invited to the school to give lectures. Students from other schools who join the reading club, in addition to food and accommodation (food costs $7 per month, accommodation costs $2), only pay a small membership fee of $2. Activities are divided by week and include English literature, social sciences, dramatic arts, and academic trips, and the program is very rich.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Shanghai Banking and Finance Industry Handles Interbank Transfer, Application for Use Requires Collateral, and Issues "Interbank Transfer Certificate" <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued the Ma telegram restricting withdrawals, the banking and finance industry association, in order to adjust interbank funds and assist industry and commerce, held small group meetings for days to study and discuss ways to stabilize the market, and held joint meetings to decide to concentrate the original reserve funds deposited in banks and the financial industry's reserve funds, totaling about 22 million yuan, which the bank reserve would convert into legal tender at 95% starting from July 4th, in twelve weekly increments, for working capital.

<h3 id="e62">Ministry of Finance Orders Four Banks to Provide Legal Tender as Much as Possible, Increased Chips Will Eliminate Premium, Check Exchange Will Be Centrally Handled <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Since the banking and finance industry association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that it provide legal tender to the industry as much as possible, it has been approved by the ministry and ordered the four banks to comply. The number of chips in the market has increased, and the financial situation will become more stable in the future. The transfer premium will be cancelled, and the exchange of checks in the silver industry will also be handled centrally. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Check Exchange to Be Handled Centrally</p>
<p>In addition to handling the exchange of checks for member banks, the Bankers' Check Exchange also collects checks from other financial institutions and the financial industry. The financial industry's check exchange specializes in handling the exchange of checks for member financial banks. The two exchanges have been quite effective since their establishment. According to the reporter of Xin Sheng She's inquiry with the banking and finance industry, it has now been decided by the two industries after consultation that the check exchange of the banking and finance industry will be handled centrally starting on July 4, 1939.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Agrees to Provide Legal Tender to the Industry</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has agreed to the request of the banking and finance industry association to provide legal tender to the industry and has ordered the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China to comply. In addition, the payment of wages to various industries will not be subject to the Ma telegram's restrictions, but an application form must be filled out and approved by the joint office of the four banks. In addition, the transfer of deposits to the interior, or the transfer of deposits to banks in the interior, and the use for the development of real industries, will also not be restricted. This is the government's encouragement of the transfer of funds to the interior and the development of agriculture, industry, and mining in the interior, so as to avoid excessive funds in Shanghai for improper speculative transactions.</p>
<p>Transfer Premium Will Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the transfer check system, an improper transfer premium has been created. Although the Ministry of Finance has ordered the prohibition of this practice, general money exchange banks have violated the ministry's order and arbitrarily charged a premium. Fortunately, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, has maintained the premium at about 50 yuan per thousand. Now that the four measures to stabilize the market have been implemented, the number of legal tender chips has increased, and the Bank Reserve Committee has stopped maintaining the transfer premium. It is expected that the transfer premium will be eliminated by itself in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that the Money Exchange Industry Association will advise member money exchange banks to stop the improper transfer premium business.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Are Not Bound</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting deposit withdrawals, foreign banks are not bound. As a result, some people are deeply concerned that funds will flow into foreign banks, but according to the reporter of Xin Sheng She's inquiry with the banking and finance industry yesterday, foreign banks do not have transfer deposit accounts, and all are in cash. However, the interest rate is lower than that of Chinese banks and financial banks. Most of the deposits are from foreigners living in Shanghai and foreign companies operated by foreigners, while there are very few Chinese deposits. As for Chinese banks, their credit is well-known, so there is no concern that funds will flow into foreign banks.</p>
<p>Four Banks Try Their Best to Regulate Finance</p>
<p>The Loan Committee of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China has been effective in regulating interbank finance and handling loan business. Member banks of the banking and finance industry association who wish to apply to the committee for loans must be transferred through the two industry reserve banks, directly regulating interbank finance and indirectly helping all industries. It is heard that as of the end of May, the outstanding balance of loans was still more than 14 million yuan. The discount rate of the committee has always been 7.5%, and the loan interest rate has always been 25%, which has not fluctuated due to market stability.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Shanghai's Radio Stations <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— David</p>
<p>At present, the number of radio stations in Shanghai has opened a new era that has never been seen before, but most of them were established after the unannounced dissolution of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications after the retreat of the National Army to the west. There are more than 20 stations. In the past, broadcasting special programs on the radio could arouse the interest of millions of listeners. Now, in addition to charity programs, Hakka broadcasts are often only broadcast once every four or five days. The programs broadcast are nothing more than comic Shanghai opera and storytelling, etc. I am afraid that after a long time, listeners will want to abandon it. The so-called special programs must of course be special. Now broadcasting back and forth is the old tune, which cannot be called special.</p>
<p>The broadcast of special programs on radio stations often causes losses to the Hakka people who broadcast fixed programs, but there are also a few radio stations that are willing to make up for the days for the Hakka people, but this is also a minority. Therefore, Hakka people would rather pay more expensive radio fees and not broadcast programs on radio stations that broadcast special programs. There is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Most of the radio stations that broadcast special programs were established after the August 13th Incident. In addition to charity special programs to appeal for refugees, the remaining old radio stations sometimes have one or two commercial public broadcasts. The East China Radio will not broadcast special programs except for charity programs, so it is very popular with fixed customers and discerning listeners. The Guohua Radio has more special programs and other listeners.</p>
<p>In the early days of Shanghai's radio stations, except for three or four Western radio stations, they were entirely operated by Chinese merchants. After the retreat of the National Army to the west, several famous Chinese radio stations had to temporarily transfer to foreign merchants, that is, East China, the Mainland, and the East. The three companies were unwilling to lose their business and transferred management to British merchants. The Shanghai Fuxing Two Radio Stations have voluntarily closed down, and the remaining newly established radio stations will not be mentioned here. As for advertising, the business of several old radio stations is of course not a problem, because Hakka people would rather pay more expensive radio fees to broadcast in the warehouse in order to have a large audience. Several new radio stations have cheaper prices, and customers are also unwilling to pay higher radio fees. It is not uncommon for them to slightly pay for radio fees to broadcast programs because of difficult emotions. As far as I know, the highest radio fee is East China, but old radio stations such as the Mainland, East, and Guohua are not cheap either. The best performing radio stations are the Mainland, East China, and Guohua, etc. They can be received in many places outside the city, and they are extremely clear in the local city. In particular, East China can broadcast to Beiping and Chongqing. Storyteller Yan Xueting often receives letters from the audience in Beiping on the station, requesting to sing opening verses. This is really commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Waterloo Prison – Overcrowding <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Birmingham</p>
<p>More than at any time in history – A prisoner deliberately commits a crime to enter prison to quit smoking</p>
<p>Waterloo Prison—the world's largest prison—has broken another record. The total number of prisoners inside is no less than 7,377, more than at any time in its history. For the past five years, the prison's population has not exceeded 7,000. During wartime, the total number indeed decreased to 4,674. However, in the past few months, the number of prisoners has surged, reaching the 7,000 mark again just a few days ago, and it seems the trend of increase continues.</p>
<p>Waterloo Prison is well-known and densely populated. A small number of prisoners commit minor crimes in order to stay inside for a few weeks. Last week, there was a case where a prisoner admitted he deliberately entered prison. It turned out this person was addicted to opium and was suffering from the pain of wanting to quit but being unable to. His friends told him to commit some petty crimes and get imprisoned in Waterloo Prison, guaranteeing he could definitely quit his addiction. Therefore, this person stole some things and was sentenced to three months in prison. He is now quitting smoking. According to prison officials, he can quit his addiction.</p>
<p>In January 1932, Waterloo Prison had 6,745 prisoners, all Chinese. Foreign prisoners were not included, because they were in the Xiamen Road Prison. But within a few months, Waterloo Prison reached its highest ever prisoner population of 7,251. Although there were many fluctuations afterward, the number decreased as some were pardoned or conditionally released. As time passed, the war came in 1937. During wartime, many prisoners were released. Originally, more prisoners were to be released, but this plan was stopped. Shells hit the prison, killing several prisoners. Fewer prisoners were brought in, so the population plummeted to 4,674. This was in October, when the war was about to move away from the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Then, the number began to gradually increase again, but according to the figures, it would not reach the previous high level again. Since 1932, the prison has been expanded, adding a foreign prisoner section, replacing the Western prison on Xiamen Road. The current number of Chinese prisoners is 7,140, which is less than the previous highest record, but when combined with the 111 foreign prisoners and the 126 inmates in the reformatory, the total is 7,377, which is the highest prisoner record in the prison's history.</p>
<p>This situation was not expected. At the beginning of this year, there were a total of 6,312 Chinese in the prison. The prison authorities estimated, based on the possible increase in crime, that the number of prisoners this year would not exceed 7,000. But it is now known that the estimate was wrong, because the increase in crime (as seen in the Shanghai Municipal Council's police and litigation reports) resulted in the number of prisoners in the prison exceeding the actual number. Since March of this year, it has continued to increase without interruption, only when prisoners are released every week, and no new ones are brought in, does the number decrease slightly.</p>
<p>The current total number of prisoners includes 25 prisoners who have been sentenced to death and are waiting for execution, 79 with life sentences, 200 with sentences of 15 years or more, 563 with sentences of 10 years or more, 902 with sentences of 7 years or more, 761 with sentences of 5 years or more, 682 with sentences of 3 years or more, 524 with sentences of 2 years or more, 886 with sentences of 1 year or more, 1,207 with sentences of 6 months or more, 828 with sentences of 3 months or more, 167 with sentences of 2 months or more, 146 with sentences of 1 month or more, 169 with sentences of 7 days or more, and there is also one prisoner whose case has not been decided.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Domestic Sales of Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is undoubtedly a commercial center in our country. Whether it is export or import, most of it passes through here. Large quantities of our domestic raw materials and goods are transported to foreign countries, or large quantities of goods are ordered from foreign countries and then transported to other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, it is correct to say that Shanghai's commerce is the hub of our national industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The woolen fabric industry in Shanghai should naturally be regarded as the hub of the national woolen fabric industry. This can be proven by looking at the sales situation of the Shanghai woolen fabric industry in recent decades. In the past, most woolen fabric firms not only supplied the needs of consumers in the city, but also regulated the demand of many other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, in the annual sales figures of many woolen fabric firms, transactions in other ports accounted for half of the total, and this proportion has even exceeded when transportation was convenient. The sales areas in North China included Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Yantai, Jinan, etc. Before the September 18th Incident, Liaoning, such as Shenyang, Yingkou, and other places, also had sales. In Central China and South China, the area was even wider, such as Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Guilin, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places. Transactions were busy every year. Places such as Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, and Hankou had particularly large annual sales. The January 28th Incident gave a great blow to sales in other ports. At that time, it was not only the woolen fabric industry, but other industries such as hardware and cotton yarn also encountered the same situation. However, because the war ended soon, the woolen fabric industry and other industries generally resumed sales in other ports not long after, and the situation did not decline much.</p>
<p>But finally, the August 13th Incident, the full-scale war of resistance, suddenly broke out in Shanghai. At that time, the woolen fabric industry was in the winter business season. Although Pingjin was already in a tense state, customers from Qinghan were coming to allocate goods one after another. At this point, they had to temporarily suspend purchases. As the war intensified, in early September, the woolen fabric industry, even local sales, fell into stagnation. Many employees also returned to their hometowns to avoid the war. By early December, when the national army withdrew from Shanghai, the woolen fabric industry and other businesses generally began to operate. At this time, the sales of other ports were cut off, and many places were in ruins, and transportation was not possible. Local sales were also very bleak. During this period, the woolen fabric industry can only be said to be maintaining the store, and everyone was sorting out their business after the shock subsided.</p>
<p>In the following year, the Jinpu Railway mail delivery in Pingjin and other places resumed. In North China, there were occasional deliveries, but no longer in the form of whole bolts and boxes like before the war. It was just a few yards and a few sets, etc. However, at that time, sales in Hankou and Wuchang suddenly became active. This was because our full-scale war had expanded to the inner perimeter of the Yangtze River, which created a deformed prosperity in Wuhan. Some Shanghai woolen fabric firms sent people to Wuhan via Ningbo and Wenzhou to "sit in the village" and supply spring and summer goods as much as possible. Therefore, the domestic sales of the woolen fabric industry at this time almost became one-sided - to Wuhan.</p>
<p>But finally, at the end of summer, Wuhan was lost again, and sales in Wuhan disappeared again.</p>
<p>Since then, the domestic sales of woolen fabrics have become stagnant. Now, the postal transportation in North China has almost been restored. Customers from Pingjin, Qinghan, and other places have also come to Shanghai to allocate goods this spring, but the quantity has been reduced to half of what it was before the war. Wuhan and other places are tightly sealed off by the Yangtze River, and transportation is even more unpredictable. They all unanimously declared that British and American goods will soon have no place in North China and the Yangtze River. This is, of course, the inevitable result of being squeezed out by others. The future of domestic sales of woolen fabrics will certainly not escape this tragic encounter.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Starless Grand Gathering – Sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association – Charity Tea Dance Competition <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>In the great Shanghai, which has become an isolated island, the atmosphere is extremely dull. The disaster relief movement in a passive sense is what everyone should do. Many flexible daughters revolve in the jazz music and neon lights every day. It seems that although they are full of smiles, they are like a group of merchants who do not know the hatred of the subjugated country. But in reality, the flattering smiles and greetings are their professional duties and the attitude they should have. And they should also not lag behind in all public welfare matters. In the past, they have done a lot of work in charity drama performances and assisting in fundraising, creating several outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to seek the best use of people's talents and to enable the dance girl group to have an effective opportunity, after the fundraising committee under its dance hall group initiated, plans to unite all the dance stars in various dance halls to hold a grand "Charity Tea Dance Competition" for a continuous month. After contacting various parties in separate ways in recent days, everyone was happy to hear the news and felt great excitement, and all the methods were quickly agreed upon, and starting from July 1st, they were able to mobilize and engage in it as a whole.</p>
<p>The location of the tea dance conference was decided to be held at the former Xianle Dance Palace, starting on July 1st, temporarily limited to one month, and the time was set from 3 pm to 8 pm every day. The dance tickets are specially printed as a kind of fruit voucher, one yuan per ticket, one ticket for three dances. These fruit vouchers are divided into two types: ten yuan per book and five yuan per book. Please ask the dance girls from each venue to enthusiastically recognize and sell them. Regarding the distribution of dance girls, each dance hall will assign 30 to 35 excellent dance girls, with seven days as a period. Each period is divided into seven groups, and each group will send four people from Monday to Friday, and five people each on Saturday and Sunday. A mixed organization method will be adopted to allow the red dance stars from each venue to participate equally, just like a grand gathering of famous actors, with a general gathering every day. The conference will have commendation methods for each star who enthusiastically participates. In addition to preparing various honorary trophies, certificates, and thank you awards, the association's various commercial industry groups will also collect a large number of gifts from major stores and national goods factories, and borrow a location in advance to display them publicly. After the tea dance conference ends, a closing ceremony will be held to distribute them to the dance stars with excellent results, as a glorious memento.</p>
<p>Entertaining for disaster relief, this kind of entertainment is really good. And for the enthusiastic sisters in the dance world, this is a good opportunity to serve the victims of the disaster. At the same time, their competition for the first place among all Shanghai dance stars and the first place among the excellent stars in each dance hall is even more different from the unconscious "dance country election". Because everything is for the relief of refugees, that is a very glorious thing, and it is also a conscientious work that everyone should do their best to do. Therefore, during this month, under the competition of the general mobilization of all Shanghai dance stars, the result will definitely be very satisfactory, and it will be enough to create immeasurable blessings for the disaster victims. It is definitely something that can be guaranteed. (Xin Shi)</p>

<p>For the sake of the safety movement, I was assigned to serve at the corner of Simalu and Guangxi Road.</p>
<p>Before departing, the principal specially gathered us together. In addition to giving us an armband, a small flag, and dozens of leaflets, he also gave us a brief lecture.</p>
<p>I arrived at the designated location at 8:20, just in time for office hours. Cars drove from the racecourse one after another, and there were also many pedestrians. The grandmothers and nannies returning from the small vegetable market walked along with large baskets and small baskets, talking to their companions. They often walked side by side in groups of three or four, so one or two of them would leave the sidewalk and walk on the side of the road. They were talking in a low voice, and they would not stop until the car was about to hit their feet. I specially distributed leaflets to these people, but most of them refused to accept them. Some said, "I don't know how to read," and some said, "I don't know how many times I've seen this thing." Unfortunately, the leaflets issued by the safety movement have only been of this kind for the past few days. The pictures are not very moving, and the words are not popular enough. Especially because there is no color, even the children are not interested – but we know that in ten traffic accidents, at least seven of the victims are ignorant children.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, the special residents of Shanghai who carry birdcages came from the racecourse in droves with their coats open. Their chest-out and stomach-out walking posture forced the women coming from the opposite side to give way. However, even when the women's feet stepped on the side of the road, either a car rushed in front or the Dongbao coachman shouted for them to make way from behind. But the special residents still swaggered forward, sometimes even bumping into the women next to them with their buttocks, and then turned their heads to look at the victims and grin.</p>
<p>I said, "Sir, please don't walk so horizontally."</p>
<p>"What! Is there even a style to walking?" He still swaggered forward.</p>
<p>The road surface of Simalu, from the "Zhungan King" to the intersection of Guangxi Road, is narrow enough to only allow two small Austins to pass. However, to the east of this section of road, there is a small vegetable market and the famous Qingpeng Pavilion. After ten o'clock, there are very few people coming and going to the small vegetable market. However, the Qinglian Pavilion has many people entering and exiting all day long. In addition, there are several teahouses and restaurants arranged opposite each other. The cars for wedding and funeral celebrations are constantly coming and going on this road. To the west of this section of road, in addition to the same number of restaurants, there are also two theaters, the Da Luotian and the Tianchan Stage. When the show starts and ends, it is either cars driving through the crowd or people walking through the cars! At such a crowded intersection, the two arms of a single police officer are naturally not enough to guarantee safety! Speaking of police officers, I found many shortcomings in my short service time. First, he condoned the chess players to gamble on the sidewalk. Even after my request, he did not intervene. Later, several of us serving classmates insisted that he drive them away. He then lazily whispered to a man in a black Indian silk long gown standing next to the chess stall, and the chess stall was immediately removed. This is really puzzling. Secondly, his traffic control seems to be particularly tolerant of cars. Sometimes, when the car is still at the entrance of the racecourse, he ignores the rickshaws and free cars waiting at both ends of Guangxi Road, so the vehicles on both sides of Guangxi Road are gathering more and more.</p>
<p>Because Wangping Street was blocked, people going from Simalu to Wumalu had to detour through Guangxi Road. Therefore, the number of pedestrians on Guangxi Road increased sharply. I believe that the reason why there have been so many traffic accidents in Shanghai recently is not only due to the faults of pedestrians and drivers, but the biggest reason is still that the area of the road cannot accommodate so many people and cars. Therefore, under such circumstances, simply passively organizing a safety movement will not achieve perfect results, and the opening of several alleyways and passages will definitely contribute more to the safety of pedestrians than us standing under the hot sun for a few days.</p>
<p>But in terms of the current environment, the safety threats faced by the people of Shanghai are indeed greater than traffic accidents. However, this does not seem to be a problem that can be solved by issuing a few leaflets and pasting a few slogans. When I was tired and passed in front of the Fulai Hotel after serving, it seemed as if several cars were preparing to devour my flesh and blood – so I felt that this safety movement organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council gave us another powerful inspiration: "If we are content with 'safety', we can hardly hope for 'total safety'."</p>
